Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 6th.

Minister of Civil Affairs, Cui Naifu, recently told reporters that socialism has bid farewell to the "China of famine." Over the past 40 years, China's disaster relief work has achieved remarkable successes. The central government alone has allocated 17 billion yuan in relief funds and over 200 billion kilograms of relief grain. State banks have annually injected large amounts of interest-free living loans and low-interest production loans into disaster-stricken areas, and tax authorities have reduced or exempted taxes for these areas. The Party and the government have led the people in overcoming one severe natural disaster after another, playing a crucial role in ensuring the safety of the people, easing social tensions, maintaining stability and unity, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity. These efforts have received widespread praise both domestically and internationally.

China has always been a country prone to disasters. According to incomplete historical records, from the Shang Dynasty (16th century BC) to 1937, there were 5,258 major disasters such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, and epidemics, averaging about one every six months. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, colonial and semi-colonial China experienced constant civil wars, with frequent disasters and heavy losses.

Minister Cui Naifu said that since the founding of New China, the Party and the government have attached great importance to disaster prevention and relief work, increasing disaster prevention facilities and continuously enhancing disaster resistance capabilities. China faces millions of natural disasters of varying magnitudes each year. Statistics show that in a typical year, the country's crops are affected over 600 million mu (approximately 40 million hectares), about 3 million houses collapse, and direct economic losses exceed 2 billion yuan. Minister Cui said that disasters and famines are closely related, but not all disasters lead to famines, which depends on the effectiveness of disaster relief. Since national liberation, the Party and the government have formulated correct disaster relief policies and guidelines, leveraging the advantages of socialism, ensuring that disasters do not lead to famines, and guaranteeing that disaster victims have food, shelter, and timely medical treatment. There have even been instances where abundant harvests were achieved in years of severe disasters.

Under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, large-scale self-reliant production efforts have been promoted, which is a major feature of China's disaster relief work. Rough estimates indicate that from 1980 to 1988, nearly 500 million disaster victims participated in various self-reliant production activities.

The socialist spirit of "when one part suffers, eight parts support" has been embodied and promoted in disaster relief work. Over the past 40 years, more than 60 billion people have participated in disaster relief efforts nationwide, rescuing hundreds of billions of yuan worth of property and minimizing disaster losses.

Under the guidance of local civil affairs departments, China's disaster relief cooperation insurance has been expanding, and various grassroots mutual aid organizations such as "grain storage associations" and "mutual aid savings associations" have been developing.

China's international disaster relief exchanges have also been expanding. According to incomplete statistics, over the past decade, China has received over $50 million in disaster relief aid from more than 50 countries, regions, and international organizations.

Minister Cui Naifu emphasized that over the past 40 years, China's disaster relief work has achieved unprecedented successes under the leadership of the Party and the socialist system. Practice has proven that only socialism can save China.

    战胜一次次严重自然灾害取得举世瞩目成就
    社会主义送走了“饥荒之中国”
    40年中央直接拨出救灾款170亿救济粮2000多亿公斤
    本报北京9月6日讯　民政部部长崔乃夫日前对记者说，社会主义送走了“饥荒之中国”。40年来，我国救灾工作取得了举世瞩目的成就，仅中央直接拨出救济灾民的生活费达170亿元，调拨救灾口粮达2000多亿公斤，国家银行每年向灾区投放大量无息生活贷款和低息生产贷款，税务部门对灾区减免税收。党和政府领导群众战胜一次又一次严重自然灾害，对保障人民生命安全，缓解社会矛盾，维护安定团结，发展生产，繁荣经济，都起了重要的作用，受到国内外广泛赞扬。
    中国自古以来一直是一个多灾的国家。据历代不完备的记载，从商朝（公元前16世纪）至1937年，共发生水、旱、地震、瘟疫等重大灾害5258次，大约平均6个月有一次。在国民党统治下的殖民地半殖民地的中国，更是连年内战，民不聊生，灾害频繁而损失惨重。
    崔乃夫部长说，新中国成立后，党和政府十分重视抗灾和救灾工作，防灾设施增多，抗灾能力不断增强。我国每年要遭受千万次大大小小自然灾害的袭击。据统计，在一般年份，全国农作物受灾面积达6亿亩以上，倒塌民房约300万间，直接经济损失在200亿元以上。崔部长说，灾和荒是紧密相联的，但并不是所有的灾害都引起灾荒，这取决于救灾工作的好坏。全国解放以后，党和政府制订了正确的救灾方针和政策，发挥了社会主义的优越性，已能做到有灾无荒，保证灾民有饭吃、有房住、有病得到及时治疗，甚至多次出现大灾之年夺丰收的动人景象。
    在党和政府的倡导和扶持下，大力开展生产自救，是我国救灾工作的一大特色。据粗略计算，从1980年至1988年，全国有近5亿灾民参加各种生产自救活动。
    “一方有难，八方支援”的社会主义新风尚，在救灾工作中得到体现和发扬。40年来，全国参加抗灾救灾的军民累计达60多亿人次，抢救财物数以百亿计，把灾害损失减少到最低限度。
    在各地民政部门的推动下，我国救灾合作保险在不断扩大，“储粮会”、“互助储金会”等多种基层互助合作组织在不断发展。
    我国救灾工作的国际交往也在日益扩大。据不完全统计，近10年来，我国得到50多个国家、地区和国际组织的5000多万美元的救灾援助。
    崔乃夫部长强调指出，建国40年来，我国的救灾工作取得了前所未有的成就，是在党的领导和社会主义制度下取得的。实践证明，只有社会主义才能救中国。
