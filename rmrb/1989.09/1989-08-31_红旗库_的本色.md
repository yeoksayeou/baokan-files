The People's Liberation Army Tengzhou Military Supply Depot is an old model unit renowned for its hard work and dedication throughout the entire military. As early as the 1960s, this depot was hailed as a red flag on the military's logistics front. More than 20 years later, despite having had 10 different leaders and numerous changes in personnel, the depot has once again been awarded a collective first-class merit citation for its exemplary frugality and integrity.

The Struggle Over String Ends and Thread Heads

The story begins four years ago during the autumn uniform distribution. At that time, over ten thousand packages of clothing needed to be unpacked and reorganized according to the needs of various units. Na Sun, the assistant, repeatedly reminded everyone to carefully untie the knots on the packaging strings, saving these strings for future use. However, he was away for just half a day, and upon his return, he found the entire depot littered with string ends and knots that had been cut with knives. Na Sun angrily shouted, "Don't you feel bad cutting these strings? This is the behavior of a spendthrift!" Despite his thunderous outburst, the soldiers continued to cut the strings indiscriminately, with some even retorting, "What era are we in? Still fussing over string ends and thread heads!"

The debate over string ends and thread heads was brought to the depot's party committee meeting. The committee members unanimously agreed that the "Red Flag Depot's" tradition of hard work and dedication was cultivated and passed down by generations. If we allow one person to break a little today and another to break a little tomorrow, even the strongest spiritual dam will collapse. Thus, a major discussion on whether the spirit of hard work and dedication had become outdated was launched throughout the depot. The party committee organized the compilation of exemplary frugal practices from various periods and invited the original leader of the depot, Comrade Qian Guozhi, an old comrade who had led the hard work and dedication efforts, from the Xuzhou Military Retirement Home. They used living examples to educate everyone. They also organized sessions to discuss national conditions and personal circumstances, conducting self-reflection and discussion meetings. Through a series of activities, the spirit of hard work and frugality prevailed once again. Some of the soldiers who had been quick to cut strings with knives said with remorse, "We not only cut the packaging strings but also severed the old revolutionary tradition, contracting the bad habit of being a spoiled child." They retrieved the "frugality box" from the scrap pile, repaired it, and placed it back at the entrance of the warehouse, demonstrating their determination to reform.

Change and Constancy

Walking into the Tengzhou Military Supply Depot today, one sees tall and orderly warehouses rising from the ground, and new office and dormitory buildings hidden among the green trees. The camp is lush with flowers and grass, and the roads are smooth, forming a stark contrast with the old photos in the exhibition hall that show the dilapidated buildings of the past. Many people have doubts: Can the "Red Flag Depot" be said to have maintained and carried forward the old traditions?

When planning the construction of the buildings, the Tengzhou Military Supply Depot had only a limited amount of maintenance funds and accumulated funds from previous years. Even with the lowest construction costs, there was still a significant shortfall. How to make up for the deficit? The depot's leadership team set two principles: one is to be meticulous in planning, and the other is self-reliance. Apart from hiring a few technical workers for guidance, the soldiers and officers did all the work themselves, from hauling sand and stones to laying foundations and building internal walls. The bricks on the old walls were originally cemented together with sand and cement, and according to common practice, they should have been demolished and discarded. However, they couldn't bear to do so. The officers and soldiers carefully removed the bricks one by one from the ruins and then scraped them clean, managing to salvage 660,000 bricks. Who among them didn't have blisters and peeling skin on their hands? Just this one item saved over 30,000 yuan. Relying on the spirit of self-reliance, they not only built a total of 12,000 square meters of buildings but also gradually purchased some mechanical equipment with the saved funds and operational income, establishing a computer room and initially implementing automated management.

Integrity and Dignity

"Traditional education is half by words and half by deeds," this is the most important lesson drawn by the Tengzhou Military Supply Depot's party committee.

What the soldiers admire the most is the frugality and integrity of the depot's leadership. The depot is filled with piles of supplies, but no officer with authority has ever taken advantage for personal gain. One officer had a broken shoelace; he would rather go to the street to buy a new one than take a pair from the depot's old shoelaces. "Supplies pile up like mountains, but not a thread is taken," this is their motto. In 1987, the military region ordered all military supply depots to dispose of a batch of surplus clothing and allowed the prices to float within a certain range. At that time, the Tengzhou Military Supply Depot had 32 types of surplus materials worth 2.05 million yuan. The officers who held the power to adjust prices became the target of some customers.

One day, two procurement officers from Henan secretly came to the home of Sun Fucheng, the head of the material disposal group, and placed a red envelope with 500 yuan on the coffee table, winking mysteriously: "This is a gift, please, Director, give us a discount on the price, and we'll talk about the rest later..." Old Sun pushed the money back into the person's bag and said sternly, "If you buy a lot, I can lower the price according to the regulations without you giving me money; if you buy a little, giving me money won't lower the price!" Later, the deal was completed, and the two procurement officers, as they left, gave a thumbs up and said, "Old Sun, we are convinced by you!"

    “红旗库”的本色
    新华社记者  王志耘  新华社通讯员  田洪德
    人民解放军滕州军需仓库是一个以艰苦奋斗闻名全军的老典型。早在60年代初期，这个仓库就被树为全军后勤战线上的一面红旗。20多年后的今天，尽管领导换了10任，战士换了一茬又一茬，但这个仓库再次以节俭廉洁的先进事迹荣立了集体一等功。
              绳头线脑之争
    事情得从4年前秋季服装发放时说起。当时，准备发放的上万包被服需要拆开，按各单位需要重新整理。孙助理员事前反复叮咛大家，要一一解开捆包绳的扣子，留着这些绳子下次捆包时用。可是，他有事离开仅半天，回来后就发现满库里丢的都是被刀割断了的绳头和绳结。孙助理员气得大声吼道：“你们割绳子时就不心疼吗？这简直是败家子作风！”然而，任凭他电闪雷鸣，战士们依然挥刀乱割，有的还反唇相讥：“都什么年月了，还抓住绳头线脑不放！”
    绳头线脑之争被提到了库党委会上。党委成员一致认为，“红旗库”艰苦奋斗的传统是靠几代人一点一滴培养带动起来的，如果任凭你今天打破一点，他明天打破一点，那再牢固的精神堤防也会崩溃。于是，一场关于艰苦奋斗精神过没过时的大讨论在全库上下展开。库党委组织人整理了各个时期的节约标兵的先进事迹，还专程从徐州军队干休所请来了艰苦奋斗的带头人、原仓库领导钱国志老人，用活生生的榜样教育大家。其后还组织了摆国情、问家情，进行自我答辩讨论会。通过一系列活动，艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约精神又占了上风。一些快刀割绳的战士沉痛地说，我们割断的不仅仅是捆包绳，而且也割断了革命的老传统，染上了大少爷的坏作风。他们从废品堆里捡回“节约箱”，修整一新重新放在库房门口，以实际行动表明自己痛改前非的决心。
              变与不变
    走进今日滕州军需仓库，一幢幢高大整齐的库房拔地而起，一栋栋崭新的办公和宿舍楼掩映在绿树丛中，营区花草繁茂，道路平整，同挂在展览室里的照片上那些过去的破屋陋室相比，形成鲜明的反差。不少人看了产生疑问：“红旗库”能说是保持和发扬了老传统吗？
    拟定建房计划时，滕州军需仓库的账上只有有限的一笔维修费和历年节余的经费。按最低造价计算还差一大截呢。不足的部分怎么办？库领导班子定下两条原则：一是精打细算，二是自力更生。除了请来少量技术工人作指导外，建房中，从拉沙子、打石料，到打地基、砌内墙等等都是官兵们自己动手干。旧房墙上的砖原来是用水泥沙浆粘到一起的，按常规都该推倒当垃圾处理，但他们舍不得。干部战士从废墟中一块一块地掰，然后再一块一块地刮，硬是用双手抠出了66万块砖，哪个人的手上没有起泡脱皮呢？仅此一项就节约了3万多块钱。他们依靠自力更生精神，不仅盖起了总计12000平方米的房子，还陆续用节约的经费和生产经营的收入购进了一些机械设施，建起了计算机室，初步实行了自动化管理。
              廉生威
    “传统教育，一半靠说，一半靠做”，这是滕州军需仓库党委的一条最重要的体会。
    最使战士们敬佩的是仓库领导班子的节俭廉洁。仓库里物资堆积如山，但手中有权的干部没有人为自己谋取过一点便宜。有个干部鞋带断了，他宁肯跑到街上再买，也绝不从仓库的旧鞋带中拿一双。“物资堆成山，一丝也不贪”，这就是他们的座右铭。1987年，军区命令各个军需仓库把一批积压的服装处理掉，并规定价格可在一定范围内浮动。滕州军需仓库里当时有32个品种、价值205万元的积压物资。手中握有价格浮动权力的仓库干部便成了一些客户进攻的对象。
    一天，从河南来的两个采购员悄悄来到物资处理小组组长孙福臣的家，把500元的红包往茶几上一按，神秘地挤挤眼：“这是见面礼，请主任在价格上照顾一点，事成后再说……”老孙把钱塞回来人的包里，严肃地说：“你若买得多，不给我送钱，按规定价格也可以调低一些；你若买得少，给我送钱也不能压价！”后来这笔买卖成交，两位采购员临走时伸出拇指连连说：“老孙，我们算服气你了！”
