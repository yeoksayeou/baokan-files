The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland of the DPRK issued a statement on September 22, strongly condemning the South Korean authorities for sentencing Reverend Mun Ik-hwan to life imprisonment. The statement said that this is a challenge to the patriotic democratic forces in South Korea and a criminal act that obstructs the reunification of Korea, and demanded that the South Korean authorities immediately and unconditionally release Mun Ik-hwan.

The statement said that on September 18, the South Korean authorities, without legal procedures, arbitrarily canceled the "evidence investigation" and the withdrawal of the legal team, and illegally sentenced Mun Ik-hwan and others to life imprisonment on charges of "espionage" and violating the "National Security Law."

The statement pointed out that Mun Ik-hwan and others visited Pyongyang to open up a broad road for dialogue, consultation, cooperation, and exchange between the North and the South, and to promote the reunification of Korea. Therefore, the South Korean authorities' judgment on Mun Ik-hwan and his party is illegal and invalid.

    朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会发表声明
    要求南朝鲜释放文益焕
    本报平壤9月23日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会发言人22日发表声明，强烈谴责南朝鲜当局判处文益焕牧师无期徒刑。声明说，这是对南朝鲜爱国民主势力的挑战，是阻碍朝鲜统一的犯罪行为，并要求南朝鲜当局立即无条件释放文益焕。
    声明说，南朝鲜当局18日在不经过法律程序，任意撤掉“证据调查”和律师团退场的情况下，以“间谍”和违反“国家保安法”等罪名，非法判处文益焕等人无期徒刑。
    声明指出，文益焕等访问平壤，是为了开拓北南对话和协商、合作与交流的广阔道路，促进朝鲜统一，因此南朝鲜对文益焕一行的判决是非法的，无效的。
