In the spring and summer of 1989, China experienced a political turmoil that later escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "This was determined by both the international climate and China's own small climate, and it was bound to happen." Among the domestic factors, one notable trend was the advocacy for privatization, which proposed converting China's public-owned enterprises entirely or largely into private enterprises. This article aims to dissect and analyze this trend.

(1) In May of last year, the *World Economic Herald* reported on a seminar held at a certain university. During the seminar, someone listed four "crimes" of the public ownership system: "The content of public ownership is empty"; "Under public ownership, workers can never become the masters of production and society"; "Public ownership is inefficient in a commodity economy"; and "Public ownership lacks a growth point." In the same month, a publication in Guangzhou argued, "If it is determined that socialism can only be built on the basis of public ownership of the means of production, then it is worth questioning whether this dogma comes from the founders of scientific socialism." It further stated, "When Marx discussed socialist ownership, he always used the concept of 'social ownership,' never the concept of 'public ownership.'" Subsequently, articles denying the dominant role of socialist public ownership and advocating privatization became increasingly prevalent, with some national newspapers publishing articles with similar views. It is worth noting that the *World Economic Herald* was particularly active in promoting privatization. Although it published two short articles with differing opinions, these were merely for balance. The reason is that the newspaper published a large number of articles advocating privatization, many of which were significant. In the latter half of last year, the *Herald* also published interviews with several scholars. Some of them explicitly stated that "political pluralism and economic privatization" were the hope for reform in socialist countries. In January of this year, the *Herald* reported that someone proposed, "If the household responsibility system is the first step in rural reform, then developing private economy should be the second urgent step in China's reform." It also stated, "Currently, the theory only regards the private economy as a 'supplementary part' of the national economy, which obviously cannot explain the problem clearly." In February, the *Herald* published a large article suggesting, "The problems in reform are simpler than people imagine, and the solutions are easier than people think. The key is to fully implement private ownership and private management. Private ownership and management are the only paths to success." Later, the *Herald* published a proposal from a Chinese scholar and doctoral student at a U.S. university. The title of the proposal was, "Privatization of State-Owned Assets: Trends and Choices in China's Economic Reform." How to implement this plan? The authors proposed three methods: (1) "Starting with the equal division of state-owned assets"; (2) "Starting with the development of current individual economy... gradually infiltrating and eventually replacing most of the state-owned economy"; (3) "Starting with encouraging savings... the bank stipulates that when residents' time deposits reach a certain amount, they can... obtain part of the loan for purchasing state-owned enterprise assets, gradually realizing the privatization of state-owned enterprise assets." The authors considered the third method to be the best. The final conclusion was: "If we fully promote the privatization of state-owned assets, China's appearance will be completely renewed."

It is clear that the advocacy for privatization has both arguments and evidence, as well as implementation methods; it is not an isolated phenomenon but has developed into a social trend.

Why has the promotion of privatization in China become increasingly intense? Firstly, it is inseparable from foreign influences. International influences are not only reflected in the privatization of state-owned enterprises in Western countries but also in some famous foreign economists directly participating in this matter. In September 1988, an "extreme free-market economist" from the United States, during a visit to China, vigorously promoted privatization and was received by Comrade Zhao Ziyang. In November, he gave a lecture at Stanford University in the United States titled "Where is China's Reform Going?" and proposed "a free private market economy" as "the fundamental solution." Secondly, it is related to Zhao Ziyang's indulgence and tolerance of bourgeois liberalization, without taking effective measures. Promoting privatization and denying socialist public ownership not only violates the party's program but also violates the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Constitution clearly stipulates: "The foundation of the socialist economic system of the People's Republic of China is the socialist public ownership of the means of production." For such significant unconstitutional propaganda, Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary, did not take effective measures to criticize and stop it.

The spread of economic privatization has had a very negative impact. It has confused people's minds and shaken the faith of many young people in socialism. The economic program of the planners of this turmoil was privatization. Fang Lizhi had already proposed in 1986: "Comprehensive Westernization includes our political system and ownership." Later, he explicitly stated, "Only by reforming the ownership system into private ownership can it be a fundamental solution." Liu Xiaobo's four major programs also included "replacing public ownership and planned economy with private ownership and market economy." Su Shaozhi, upon returning from abroad, also explicitly proposed the slogan of "economic privatization" in the *World Economic Herald*. The *China's Hope – A Declaration of Private Ownership* that appeared during the turmoil is also a representative work in this regard.

(2) Some articles claim, "The establishment of socialism on the basis of public ownership of the means of production is not the thought of the founders of scientific socialism. Because their works do not contain the concept of socialist public ownership." This statement is far from the truth. As early as the 1940s, the founders of scientific socialism clearly stated, "The abolition of private ownership and the establishment of public ownership" as one of the goals of communists, and said, "The proletariat can only liberate itself by abolishing all private ownership." (See *Selected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 4, p. 319; Vol. 1, p. 213.) More importantly, they analyzed theoretically why capitalist private ownership must transform into socialist public ownership. They discovered that the fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system is the contradiction between socialized production and capitalist private ownership, and it is the development of this contradiction that leads to the transformation of ownership.

The issue is clear, so why has it become an issue again? This also involves the problem of translating the original German text. Some comrades believe that the meaning of this word is "social ownership" and cannot be translated as "public ownership." They also believe that Marx and Engels did not use the concept of public ownership when discussing socialist ownership. This translation verification is originally a scholarly issue. However, it has been seized by those advocating privatization, leading to the conclusion: Since the "founders" did not use the concept of socialist public ownership, why should we insist on public ownership? According to the research and verification of some comrades and German language experts, they found that in the German-Chinese dictionaries published domestically, this word indeed only has the meaning of "social ownership." However, in the original dictionaries of both East and West Germany, it has the meanings of both "social ownership" and "public ownership." Especially when people use it to compare with "private ownership," translating it as "public ownership" is completely correct. For example, the passage in *Anti-Dühring* (see *Selected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 3, p. 170) is such a case.

Furthermore, some comrades found that Marx and Engels used two other German words when discussing the public ownership of socialist and communist societies. The meanings of these two words are public ownership and public property. For example, the original text of "communist public ownership" in the 1882 preface to the *Communist Manifesto* is such a case (see *Selected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 1, p. 231).

In summary, using translation to deny socialist public ownership and advocate privatization is completely wrong. As for social ownership as a form of socialist public ownership, it has existed for many years in Yugoslavia. It is completely appropriate for us to study and discuss it.

(3) Those advocating "economic privatization" claim, "Public ownership is different from private ownership. Due to the lack of motivation to accumulate personal property, it cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of workers, leading only to low efficiency and stagnant production." If this argument were valid, socialist public ownership should indeed be replaced by private ownership. However, it is far from the truth.

Firstly, private ownership of the means of production can indeed mobilize the enthusiasm of the owner, but it cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the working class. Capitalist private ownership brings exploitation to the working class. The working class sells its labor power to the capitalist, just like selling its own skin in the market, trembling and letting the capitalist tan it (see *Collected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 23, p. 220), how can their enthusiasm be mobilized?

Secondly, how is the enthusiasm of workers in socialist countries mobilized? Firstly, it is necessary to change the situation where workers lose the means of production and are exploited by others. This requires the establishment of socialist public ownership. A new economic system must be established, and the correct principle of material interest (or to perfect the "interest mechanism") must be adhered to. Additionally, workers must be allowed to participate in management and truly become the masters of the enterprise. The advanced enterprises like Shougang have implemented the full-employee contract system, enhanced the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers, stimulated their pioneering spirit, and achieved remarkable results, which proves this point.

Thirdly, the claim that socialist public ownership can only bring about "low efficiency and stagnant production" is equivalent to denying the achievements of a decade of reform and ignoring the fact that China's economic growth rate is higher than that of developed capitalist countries. From 1980 to 1985, China's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 9.2%, while developed countries grew at 2.3%, the United States at 2.1%, and Japan at 4%; domestic GDP grew at an average annual rate of 9.8%, while developed countries grew at 2.3%, the United States at 2.5%, and Japan at 3.8%. Even Nixon acknowledged in his new book, *1999: Victory Without War*, that China's economic growth rate in 1986 was 11%, three times the average growth rate of Western industrialized countries. China's achievements mentioned above were made under the condition that socialist public ownership is the mainstay. How can socialist public ownership be denigrated as having no merits?

It is also important to note that after a decade of reform, China has emerged with a number of advanced enterprises that have created high labor productivity. Taking Shougang as an example, in the past decade, the labor productivity calculated by net output value has increased by 2.6 times, with an average annual increase of 13.66%, surpassing the growth rate of all large steel enterprises in developed countries. Shougang's blast furnace utilization coefficient, converter utilization coefficient, and comparable energy consumption per ton of steel have all entered the world's advanced ranks. The facts have shattered the myth that socialist public ownership must be inefficient. Why should it be said that state-owned enterprises must be privatized to have a way out?

(4) Those advocating privatization also present a reason: "Without changing the ownership system, China will suffer from a lack of cohesion and social centripetal force." The so-called social centripetal force mainly refers to the broad members of society striving together towards a common goal. In China, whether the society has centripetal force (whether people's hearts are scattered) is whether everyone is striving together to build a modern socialist power. In China, is it privatization that has centripetal force, or is it the insistence on socialist public ownership as the mainstay that has more centripetal force? This is not difficult to answer. It is known that the ideological views formed on the basis of public ownership are collectivism, where individual interests are subordinate to collective and national interests. Therefore, socialist public ownership is the foundation for the formation of social centripetal force in China. On the contrary, the worldview that grows on the basis of private ownership is "if you do not act for yourself, you will be punished by heaven and earth." Once China's ownership system is transformed into individual private ownership, it will inevitably lead to a situation where people do not care about the collective and the country, each person runs for themselves, and even harms it. This certainly weakens rather than strengthens social centripetal force. Secondly, socialist public ownership ensures that the broad masses of laborers will not be exploited due to the loss of the means of production, which is the premise for the broad masses of laborers to advance towards common prosperity. Once privatization is implemented, there will inevitably be serious polarization and wealth disparity. The emergence of a situation of opposition between the rich and the poor will increase or decrease social centripetal force, is it not obvious?

Currently, many people in China are dissatisfied and disappointed with the status quo, which is closely related to the mistakes in reform and economic work (such as inflation, corruption, and unfair distribution). The root of these problems is not in socialist public ownership, and solving these problems does not require abandoning socialist public ownership. Many facts show that reform under the premise of insisting on socialist public ownership can overcome the scattering of people's hearts and enhance cohesion and social centripetal force. Comrade Zhou Guanshu, based on the experience of Shougang's ten years of reform, wrote in the *People's Daily* that "the contract system has made Shougang advance step by step... and produced a great deal of cohesion." Last year, several loss-making military-industrial enterprises were merged into Shougang. According to a reporter from the *People's Daily*, before the merger, these enterprises generally had the problem of "old workers wanting to retire early to make big money, young people wanting to make money outside, and those with skills not wanting to make dead money in the factory." After merging into Shougang, the ownership of the enterprise did not change, but only by correctly handling the relationship between the state, the enterprise, and individuals according to the principles of Shougang's contract system, achieving the combination of responsibility, rights, and interests, the enterprise and employees formed a "community of destiny," and thus production increased step by step, turning the loss-making situation around. As a result, almost all those who requested transfers withdrew their transfer applications, and even those who had already transferred requested to return. The practice of reform shows that the cohesion of the enterprise and the centripetal force of society do not need to be formed by denying socialist public ownership. If it is said that as long as privatization is implemented, there will be no scattering of people's hearts and loss of social centripetal force, then why did Chiang Kai-shek's privatization in old China for more than twenty years lose the hearts of the people, cause a rebellion, and ultimately lead to the collapse of the dynasty?

(5) Those advocating privatization also cite Marx's statement about "reestablishing individual ownership" as evidence. They believe that Marx said in *Capital* that the future society should "reestablish individual ownership," meaning that everyone should become the private owner of the means of production. We believe that interpreting "reestablishing individual ownership" as everyone becoming the private owner of the means of production in a socialist and communist society is a serious distortion. What was Marx's original intention? The original statement is as follows: "...capitalist private ownership is the first negation of individual, labor-based private ownership. But capitalist production, by the necessity of the natural process, creates the negation of itself. This is the negation of the negation. This negation is not the reestablishment of private ownership, but the reestablishment of individual ownership on the basis of the achievements of the capitalist era, that is, on the basis of cooperation and the common ownership of land and means of production produced by labor itself" (see *Collected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 23, p. 832). Marx regarded the individual, labor-based private ownership (i.e., the private ownership of small producers) before the capitalist society as "affirmation," regarded capitalist private ownership as "negation," and regarded the individual ownership based on the public ownership of the means of production as "negation of the negation." This means that the so-called individual ownership to be reestablished in the future society is based on the public ownership of the means of production, and Marx explicitly pointed out that this second negation is "not the reestablishment of private ownership." Therefore, how can "reestablishing individual ownership" be interpreted as reestablishing the private ownership of the means of production—even if it is "individual ownership for everyone"? Then, what does the "individual ownership" here refer to? When Duhring ridiculed Marx's statement, saying that "both individual and public ownership" is a "chaotic world" and a "mixed breed," Engels clearly replied: "...the restoration of individual ownership based on the public ownership of land and means of production produced by labor itself. For anyone who understands German, this is, public ownership includes land and other means of production, individual ownership includes products, that is, consumer goods" (see *Collected Works of Marx and Engels*, Vol. 20, p. 143). It is clear that the so-called "individual ownership" in the future society refers to consumer goods and consumer resources, not the means of production. Can it be said that this is only Engels' view, and Marx himself does not agree with this interpretation? No. It is known that Marx had seen the manuscript of *Anti-Dühring*, and the book was published and distributed during Marx's lifetime. This shows that Engels' interpretation did not deviate from Marx's original intention.

Some people argue that "partial private ownership" is not good, but "individual ownership for everyone" is good (because everyone has the means of production, and they are equal to each other). We will not comment on the good or bad of "individual ownership for everyone" for now. However, it must be pointed out that under the condition of the existence of private ownership, with the development of the commodity economy, it is inevitable that some people will fail and go bankrupt due to various reasons in the competition, losing the means of production, while others will succeed in the competition and become rich, owning a large amount of means of production. In other words, under the condition of the existence of private ownership and the commodity economy, "individual ownership for everyone" is just an illusion.

Finally, is there no way out for reform without privatization? No! The practice of a decade of reform has shown that reform is feasible under the premise of insisting on socialist public ownership as the mainstay. The achievements of reform in many places have also proven this point. Of course, the forms of public ownership are diverse, and this aspect should continue to be explored. However, we cannot deviate from the socialist direction and engage in economic privatization.

    评私有化思潮
    周隆滨
    1989年春夏，我国发生了一场政治动乱，后又发展成为反革命暴乱。正如邓小平同志深刻指出：“这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的”。在国内的小气候中，有一股引人注目的思潮，这就是私有化（即主张将我国的公有制企业，全部或大部转变为私有制企业）的思潮。本文对此作一些解剖和分析。
    （一）去年5月，《世界经济导报》报道某高等学校举行报告会。会上有人罗织了公有制四条罪名：“公有制的内容空虚”；在公有制下“劳动者永远成不了生产和社会的主人”；
  “商品经济中公有制是低效率的”；“公有制没有生长点”。同月，广州某刊物载文提出，“如若认定社会主义只能建立在生产资料公有制基础上是一个天条”，那么“说这一天条来自科学社会主义创始人，则值得商榷”。还说：“马克思在论述社会主义所有制时总是运用社会所有制这一概念，而从不使用公有制概念”。以后，否定社会主义公有制的主体地位，鼓吹私有化的文章愈益增多，一些全国性报刊都发表了这种观点的文章。需要指出的是，《世界经济导报》在宣传私有化上特别卖力。它虽发表了两篇持不同意见的短文，但不过是一种陪衬。因为该报登载了大量宣传私有化的文章，而且不少是“重头”。去年下半年，《导报》又发表了对一些学者的专访。其中有些人明确把“政治上要多元化，经济上要私有化”，作为社会主义国家改革的希望。今年1月，该报报道，有人提出，
  “如果说包产到户是农村的第一步改革，那么发展私人经济则应作为中国当务之急的第二步改革”。还说：“现在理论上仅仅把私营经济作为国民经济‘补充部分’，显然没法把问题解释清楚的”。2月，该报又登了一篇大块文章。文中提出：
  “改革中的问题比人们想象的简单得多，解决的办法也比人们想象的容易得多，这就是彻底实行私有、民营。”“私有、民营是唯一的成功之途”。以后，该报又载了美国某大学的中国学者和博士生的建议书。它的题目就是：“国有财产个人化：中国经济改革的趋势和选择”。如何实现这个方案呢？作者设计了三种方法：（1）“从平分国有财产入手”；（2）“从培育目前的个体经济入手……通过其发展壮大逐步浸润以至取代大部分国有经济”；（3）“从鼓励储蓄入手……银行规定居民户的定期储蓄达到一定数量，便可……获得个人购买国有企业财产的部分贷款，逐步实现国有企业财产的个人化”。三种方法，他们认为以末者为最佳。最后结论是：“全面推行国有财产个人化，中国的面貌定将焕然一新”。
      显然，私有化的主张已经是，既有论点又有论据和实施方法；不是个别现象，而是发展成为一种社会思潮。
      私有化的宣传在我国为何会愈演愈烈？首先，它同国外的影响分不开。国际影响不仅表现在西方国有企业私有化的影响上，而且表现在有的外国著名经济学家直接参与了此事。1988年9月，一位美国“极端自由派经济学家”在访问中国时，就大力兜售私有化，并得到赵紫阳同志接见。11月，他又在美国斯坦福大学以“中国经改往何处去”为题作演讲，提出“自由的私有市场经济”“这是根本的办法”。其次是同赵紫阳同志对资产阶级自由化姑息、纵容，没有采取有力的措施有关。宣传私有化，否定社会主义公有制，不仅违反我们党的纲领，也违反了我国的宪法。宪法明确规定：“中华人民共和国的社会主义经济制度的基础是生产资料的社会主义公有制”。对于这种关系重大的违宪宣传，作为总书记的赵紫阳同志，并没有采取有效的措施加以批评和制止。
      经济私有化的泛滥，起了极坏的作用。它搅乱了人们的思想，动摇了不少青年对社会主义的信念，这次动乱策划者的经济纲领就是私有化。方励之早在1986年就提出：全盘西化
  “包括我们的政治体制、所有制”。后来他又明确说：“唯有改革所有制为私有制方是根本办法。”刘晓波的四大纲领之一，也是“用私有制、市场经济代替公有制、计划经济”。苏绍智从国外回来后，在《世界经济导报》上，也明确提出“经济私有化”的口号。在动乱中出现的《中国的希望——私有制宣言》，也是这个方面的代表作。
      （二）有些文章断言：“社会主义建立在生产资料公有制基础上，不是科学社会主义创始人的思想。因为他们的著作中，根本没有社会主义公有制的概念”。这个说法与事实却太不相符。早在上世纪40年代，科学社会主义创始人就明确把
  “消灭私有制而代之以财产公有”，作为共产主义者的宗旨之一，并说：“无产者却只有废除一切私有制才能解放自己”。
  （《马克思恩格斯选集》第4卷，第319页；第1卷，第213页）更重要的是，他们从理论上分析了资本主义私有制为何必然转变为社会主义公有制。他们发现资本主义制度的基本矛盾是社会化生产和资本主义私有制的矛盾，正是这个矛盾的发展导致了所有制的变革。
      问题本来是明白的，为何又成了问题呢？这里也涉及到德文原文的翻译问题。有的同志认为这个词的含义就是“社会所有制”，不能译“公有制”。并认为马克思恩格斯在讲社会主义的所有制时，严格地不使用公有制概念。这个翻译考证本来是一个学术问题。但它却被主张私有化的人抓住，并得出：既然“创始人”都不用社会主义公有制概念，我们为何要坚持公有制呢？据一些同志和德语专家的研究、查对，他们发现在国内出版的德汉辞典中，这个词的确只有“社会所有制”的含义。然而无论在民主德国还是西德的原文辞典中，它都既有“社会所有制”又有“公有制”的含义。特别是当人们把它同“私有制”对比起来论述时，译为“公有制”是完全正确的。比如不少文章引用的《反杜林论》上的那段话（“……以自己劳动为基础的分散的个人私有制转变为资本主义私有制，同事实上已经以社会化生产为基础的资本主义私有制转变为公有制比较起来，自然是一个长久得多、艰苦得多、困难得多的过程”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第3卷，第170页），就是如此。
      另外，一些同志还发现，马克思恩格斯论述社会主义、共产主义社会的公有制时，还使用过另外两个德文词。这两个词的含义就是公有制、公有财产。比如《共产党宣言》1882年序言中的“共产主义的公共所有制”的原文，就是如此（《马克思恩格斯选集》第1卷，第231页）。
    总之，利用翻译来否定社会主义公有制，鼓吹私有化，是根本不对的。至于社会所有制作为社会主义公有制的一种形式，在南斯拉夫存在了多年，我们对它进行研究、探讨，那是完全应该的。
      （三）主张“经济私有化”的人断言：“公有制与私有制不同，由于缺乏追求私人财产积累的动力，因而无法调动工人的积极性，只能导致效率低下、生产停滞”。这条论据如能成立，社会主义公有制就理应由私有制代替。然而它离真理相距甚远。
      第一，生产资料私有制无疑能够调动私有主的积极性，但不能调动工人阶级的积极性。资本主义私有制对工人阶级带来的是剥削。工人阶级把劳动力出卖给了资本家，像在市场上出卖了自己的皮一样，战战兢兢让资本家去鞣（参见《马克思恩格斯全集》第23卷，第220页），又怎么能把他们的积极性调动起来呢？
    第二，社会主义国家工人劳动者的积极性，靠什么调动呢？首先需要改变工人丧失生产资料、任人剥削的状况。这就要建立社会主义公有制。要建立新的经济体制，坚持正确的物质利益原则（或者说完善“利益机制”）。另外，还必须让工人参加管理，真正成为企业的主人。首钢等先进企业推行全员承包制，增强了广大工人的主人翁责任感，激发了他们的首创精神，取得显著效果，就证明了这点。
      第三，断言社会主义公有制只能带来“低效率，生产停滞”，无异于否定了十年改革的成就，无视我国经济增长率高于发达资本主义国家的事实。1980—1985年，我国国民生产总值年均增长9.2％，发达国家为2.3％，美国为2.1％，日本为4％；国内生产总值，我国年均增长9.8％，发达国家为2.3％，美国为2.5％，日本为3.8％。连尼克松也在其新著：
  《1999：不战而胜》中，承认中国经济“1986年的年均增长率为11％，是西方工业化国家平均增长率的3倍”。我国的上述成就，是在社会主义公有制占主体的情况下取得的，怎么能把社会主义公有制，丑化得一无是处呢？
      还要看到，经过十年改革，我国已经涌现出一批先进企业，它们创造了较高的劳动生产率。以首钢为例，十年来按净产值计算的劳动生产率，增长2.6倍，平均每年递增13.66％，超过了所有发达国家大型钢铁企业的增长率。首钢的高炉利用系数、转炉利用系数、吨钢可比能耗等指标，都进入世界先进行列。事实打破了社会主义公有制必然是低效率的“神话”，为什么“国营企业必须私有化才有出路”呢？
      （四），主张私有化的人还提出一个理由：“不改变所有制，中国将人心涣散，社会将无向心力”。所谓社会向心力主要是指社会的广大成员，围绕着一个共同目标努力奋斗。在我国，社会有无向心力（人心是否涣散），是指大家是否都围绕着建设社会主义现代化强国而努力奋斗。在我国到底是实行私有化有向心力，还是坚持社会主义公有制为主体更有向心力？这是不难回答的。大家知道，在公有制基础上形成的思想观点，是集体主义，是个人利益服从集体和国家的利益。所以社会主义公有制是我国社会向心力形成的基础。相反，在私有制基础上成长起来的世界观，是“人不为己，天诛地灭”。一旦中国的所有制都蜕化为个人私有制，势必出现不顾集体、国家，人人为自己奔忙，甚至损害它的严重局面。这当然不是增强而是削弱了社会向心力。其次，社会主义公有制使广大劳动者不会因丧失生产资料而遭到剥削，也是使广大劳动者沿着共同富裕道路前进的前提。而一旦实行私有化，必然要出现严重的两极分化、贫富悬殊。贫富对立局面的出现，是增强还是减少了社会向心力，不是显而易见的吗？
    我国当前不少人对现状存在不满和失望情绪，这是同改革和经济工作中的失误问题
  （诸如通货膨胀、腐败现象和分配不公）密切关联的。它们的根源不在社会主义公有制，解决这些问题也用不着放弃社会主义公有制。许多事实表明，在坚持社会主义公有制前提下进行改革，能够克服人心涣散，增强凝聚力、社会向心力。周冠五同志根据首钢十年改革的经验，曾在《人民日报》著文指出：“承包制使首钢步步前进……产生了很大的凝聚力”。去年有十几家亏损的军工企业并入首钢。据人民日报记者报道，归并前这些企业普遍存在：“老工人想提前退休挣大钱，年轻人想到外边挣活钱，有技术的不想在厂里挣死钱”。并入首钢后，企业的所有制未变，只是照首钢承包制的原则，正确处理了国家、企业、个人三者的关系，做到了责权利相结合，使企业和职工结成了“命运共同体”，因而生产节节上升，扭转了亏损局面。这样一来，不仅绝大多数要求调离的人撤回了请调报告，而且已调离的又要求回来。改革的实践表明，企业的凝聚力，社会的向心力，并不需要通过否定社会主义公有制来形成。如果说只要实行私有化，就不会人心涣散和社会失去向心力。那么，蒋介石在旧中国搞了二十多年的私有化，为何竟丧失民心，众叛亲离，最后导致王朝的覆灭呢？
        （五），主张私有化的人，还引证马克思关于“重建个人所有制”的论断作为论据。他们认为，马克思在《资本论》中说的未来社会要“重建个人所有制”，就是要建立生产资料“人人皆有的私有制”。我们认为，把“重建个人所有制”解释成在社会主义、共产主义社会中，人人都要成为生产资料的私有者，这是严重的歪曲。马克思的原意是什么呢？原话是这样的：“……资本主义的私有制，是对个人的、以自己劳动为基础的私有制的第一个否定。但资本主义生产由于自然过程的必然性，造成了对自身的否定。这是否定的否定。这种否定不是重新建立私有制，而是在资本主义时代的成就的基础上，也就是说，在协作和对土地及靠劳动本身生产的生产资料的共同占有的基础上，重新建立个人所有制”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第23卷，第832页）。马克思把资本主义社会以前的以个人劳动为基础的私有制（即小生产者的个体私有制）看作“肯定”，把资本主义私有制看作“否定”，而把生产资料公有制基础上的个人所有制看作“否定之否定”。这就是说，所谓未来社会重建的个人所有制是以生产资料的公有制为基础的，而且马克思明确指出，这第二个否定“不是重新建立私有制”。因此怎么能把“重建个人所有制”解释为重建生产资料的私有制——哪怕是“人人皆有的私有制”呢？那么这里的“个人所有制”指的是什么呢？当杜林讽刺马克思这段话，说什么“既是个人的又是公共的所有制”是“混沌世界”，“混乱杂种”时，恩格斯明确回答说：“……被称为以土地和靠劳动本身生产的生产资料的公有制为基础的个人所有制的恢复。对任何一个懂德语的人来说，这就是，公有制包括土地和其他生产资料，个人所有制包括产品即消费品。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第20卷，第143页）很清楚，所谓未来社会的“个人所有制”，不是指生产资料而是指消费品、消费资料。那么，能否说这只是恩格斯的观点，马克思本人并不同意这种解释呢？不能。众所周知，《反杜林论》的手稿马克思是看过的，而且该书是在马克思在世时出版发行的。这说明，恩格斯的解释，并没有离开马克思的原意。
      有些人辩解说：“部分人私有制”是不好的，但“人人皆有的私有制”是好的（因为大家都有生产资料，彼此是平等的）。我们暂且不来评论“人人皆有的私有制”的好坏。但必须指出：在私有制存在的条件下，随着商品经济的发展，必然有人因为种种原因在竞争中失败、破产，丧失生产资料，而另一些人在竞争中取胜，成了富翁，拥有大量的生产资料。也就是说，在私有制和商品经济存在的条件下，“人人皆有的私有制”，不过是一种幻想。
      最后，是否离开私有化，改革就没有出路呢？否！十年改革的实践已经表明，在坚持社会主义公有制占主体的前提下进行改革，是行得通的。许多地方改革的成效，都表明了这点。当然公有制的形式是多种多样的，这方面还应继续探索。但不能背离社会主义方向，搞经济私有化。
