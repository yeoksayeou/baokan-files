As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are delighted to see that exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have become increasingly broad and deep.

Over the past two years, exchanges between the two sides have rapidly developed. These exchanges cover various fields such as culture, sports, science and technology, academia, and trade. Since 1988, during traditional festivals like the Spring Festival and the Lantern Festival, Taiwanese and mainland singers have performed together on stage. The mainland people have become familiar with the names of Taiwanese singers such as Fei Xiang, Pan Anbang, Bao Li, and Gu Qi Hua. Exhibitions of Taiwanese calligraphy and painting have been held one after another. Works by Jiang Mingxian, Liu Ming, and many other Taiwanese painters and calligraphers have been successively displayed on the mainland. At the same time, works by famous mainland painters such as Wu Zuoren, Li Keran, Li Keran, and Huang Zhou have also been exhibited in Taiwan and have been well-received by the Taiwanese people. Taiwanese traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have come to mainland medical colleges and hospitals for further studies, and some have even come to the mainland to take traditional Chinese medicine qualification exams. The sports circles on both sides have long been familiar with each other in international competitions around the world. In April 1989, the Taipei gymnastics team made its first public appearance in Beijing to participate in the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships. Just a few months later, Taipei table tennis, judo, and handball teams have come to the mainland to participate in various international competitions. In the religious sphere, groups of Buddhist monks from Taiwan have come to the mainland to pay homage to their ancestors, chant scriptures, and spread the Dharma, making many friends in the religious circles on the mainland. Especially, groups of Matsu worshippers from various parts of Taiwan have come to the Matsu Temple in Meizhou Island, Fujian Province, to pay homage to their ancestors, with thousands of people each time. Academics and prominent figures such as Wu Zhelang, Hu Qiuyuan, Wang Tuo, Wang Xiaobo, Zhang Xiaochun, Wang Zhaojun, Shi Xingzhong, and Qiu Lianhui have also visited the mainland many times and have had extensive discussions with relevant mainland figures on issues of concern to the people on both sides.

With the deepening of exchanges between the two sides, two projects have attracted much attention this year. One is professional matching, and the other is legal discussions. Professional matching exchanges have been carried out in various fields such as education, music, publishing, and environmental protection. Many Taiwanese businessmen have successfully invested in factories on the mainland. This year, various chambers of commerce and associations have organized delegations to the mainland to discuss cooperation and investment opportunities with their counterpart industries. The era of general business delegations coming to the mainland for a quick tour seems to be over. Second, with the increase in civilian exchanges, legal matters between the two sides have become increasingly prominent. Last year, lawyers, patent, trademark, arbitration, and copyright departments from both sides had already begun to make contact. This year, in July, Professor Wang Zhiwen from Taiwan's Cultural University, and in August, a delegation of Taiwanese professors including Cai Songlin and Li Shenyi, exchanged views with mainland legal scholars on civil and commercial matters related to cross-strait relations, reaching many beneficial consensus.

Running through these exchanges is the "blood-thick-than-water" kinship and the shared aspiration of the entire Chinese nation for common prosperity and development. Years of fear and suspicion have gradually dissipated, and millions of people are considering the further development of cross-strait relations. The most prominent issue at present is: the Taiwan authorities, under various pretexts, restrict mainland people from visiting Taiwan to reunite with their families, and even make it difficult for Taiwanese veterans who were taken to the mainland by the Kuomintang to fight in the civil war in 1947 to return home to visit their families. So far, only 2,000 mainland people have been allowed to visit Taiwan for medical treatment or funerals, which is a huge difference compared to the tens of thousands of Taiwanese who have visited the mainland. The Taiwan authorities should not only further lift the restrictions on mainland people visiting Taiwan but also should not set obstacles for civilian exchanges between the two sides.

We sincerely hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the will of the people and adapt to the requirements of the times, allowing civilian exchanges between the two sides to change from "one-way" to "two-way," learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and walking the path of common prosperity.

　　喜看两岸民间交流深入发展
　　中华全国台湾同胞联谊会副会长　郭平坦
    值此欢度国庆40周年之际，我们高兴地看到海峡两岸民间交往愈来愈广泛、深入。
    近两年来两岸民间的交往迅速发展。交往的范围包括文化、体育、科技、学术以及经贸等等方面。1988年以来，每到“春节”、“元宵”等传统佳节，都有台湾歌手和大陆歌手同台表演，大陆人民已熟悉了费翔、潘安邦、鲍立、顾其华等台湾歌手的名字。台湾书画家的展览也接连不断。江明贤、刘铭以及许多台湾画家、书法家的作品陆续在大陆展出。与此同时，大陆著名画家吴作人、李可染、李苦禅、黄胄等人的作品也得以在岛内展出，深受台湾人民的喜爱。台湾的中医师到大陆各地的中医学院、中医医院进修，还有的专程到大陆参加中医资格考试。两岸的体育界早已在世界各地的国际比赛中相互熟悉。1989年4月，台北体操队第一次公开到北京参加亚洲青年体操锦标赛。之后仅仅几个月，已有台北乒乓球、柔道、手球队来大陆参加各种国际比赛了。在宗教方面，一批批台湾佛教界的法师到大陆拜祖、诵经弘法，广交大陆宗教界朋友。特别是台湾各地的妈祖信徒纷纷组团来福建省湄洲岛妈祖庙谒祖进香，每次有数千人之多。学术界和各界著名人士，吴哲朗、胡秋原、王拓、王晓波、张晓春、王兆钏、施性忠、邱连辉等先生，也多次访问大陆，并与大陆有关人士就两岸人民关心的问题进行了广泛的探讨。
    随着两岸民间交往的深化，今年来两个项目颇受各方面的注目。一是专业对口，二是法律探讨。专业对口交流已在教育、音乐、出版、环保等各领域开展。已有许多台湾企业家成功地在大陆投资设厂。今年来又有各种工商界行会、公会纷纷组团来大陆找对口行业深入探讨合作、投资的可行性。一般的工商考察团来大陆走马观花的时代似乎过时了。二是随着民间来往的增多，两岸间法律事务关系日益突出。去年两岸律师以及专利、商标、仲裁、版权等部门均已开始接触。今年两岸法律界人士，7月份有台湾文化大学教授王志文，8月份有柴松林、李伸一等台湾教授团与大陆法律学者就有关两岸关系的民事、商事等问题交换意见，取得了许多有益的共识。
    贯串这些交流的是“血浓于水”的乡亲情谊和整个中华民族共同繁荣发展的美好愿望。多年来的恐惧、疑虑逐渐消逝，千千万万民众都在考虑两岸关系的进一步发展。当前突出的问题是：台湾当局以种种借口限制大陆人民到台湾探亲，甚至刁难1947年被国民党拉到大陆打内战的台籍老兵返乡探亲。到目前为止，大陆人民到台湾探病、奔丧的才2000名，与台湾到大陆的几十万人相差甚大。台湾当局应该不仅进一步开放大陆人民赴台探亲的限制，而且也不要为两岸民间交流设置障碍。
    我们殷切期望台湾当局顺乎民意，适应时代要求，让两岸民间交流从“单向”变成“双向”，互相取长补短，走共同繁荣之路。
