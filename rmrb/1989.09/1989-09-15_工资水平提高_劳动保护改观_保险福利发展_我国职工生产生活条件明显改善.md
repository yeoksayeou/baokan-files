On the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity, the working and living conditions for Chinese workers have significantly improved.

Data provided by the Ministry of Labor indicates that from 1952 to 1988, China's gross national product increased by 10.8 times, and national income increased by 10 times. The total wage of workers nationwide increased from 6.83 billion yuan in 1952 to 231.62 billion yuan in 1988. The average nominal wage (calculated at current prices) increased from 445 yuan in 1952 to 1,747 yuan in 1988. After accounting for the increase in the cost of living index for workers during the same period, the real increase was 66.1%.

With the development of labor protection, the working conditions for workers have significantly improved. A preliminary system of labor protection laws and regulations has been established, and the level of labor protection and safety management has made significant progress. Compared to the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, the rate of fatal accidents has significantly decreased. For example, the fatality rate per 1,000 workers in state-owned and collective enterprises at the county level and above has decreased from 0.520 in 1950 to 0.099 in 1988, a reduction of 81%.

China's social insurance and welfare for workers have developed rapidly from nothing to something, and from small to large. By the end of 1988, 150 million people were enjoying insurance and welfare benefits, an increase of 50 times compared to 1952. The expenditure on insurance and welfare was 65.55 billion yuan, 69 times the 9.5 billion yuan spent in 1952.

    本报讯　记者江绍高报道：在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，我国职工生产生活条件明显改善。
    劳动部提供的数据表明，自1952年至1988年，我国国民生产总值增长了10.8倍，国民收入增长10倍。全国职工工资总额由1952年的68.3亿元增加到1988年的2316.2亿元，货币平均工资（以当年价格计算）由1952年的445元增加到1988年的1747元，扣除同期职工生活费用价格指数上涨因素后，实际增长66.1％。
    职工劳动生产条件随着劳动保护的发展，有了较大的改观。已初步形成我国的劳动保护法规体系，劳动保护、安全管理水平有了明显进步。同建国初期相比，伤亡事故有了大幅度下降。如县以上国营、集体企业职工千人死亡率已从1950年的0.520下降到1988年的0.099，下降了81％。
    我国职工的社会保险和福利事业从无到有，从小到大，发展很快。到1988年底，享受保险福利待遇的人员有1.5亿人，比1952年增加50倍；开支保险福利费用655.5亿元，是1952年9.5亿元的69倍。
