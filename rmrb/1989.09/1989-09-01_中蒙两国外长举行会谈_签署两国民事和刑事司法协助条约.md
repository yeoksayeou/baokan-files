I am confident that Foreign Minister Gombosuren's visit to China in the spring and my visit to your country this time will play a positive role in further developing friendly relations between the two countries and promoting exchanges and cooperation between the two foreign ministries. In the future, we will continue to make positive efforts to develop friendly neighborly relations between China and Mongolia in the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance between China and Mongolia and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."
