	The Developer of "Software" - A Record of National Labor Model Worker Zhang Shilun
	By People's Daily reporter Meng Xiaoyun

	Zhang Shilun, at 44 years old, first gained fame in Tianjin for his self-taught, arduous efforts in an 8-square-meter attic, where he developed 67 different specifications of new products. This brought in 2 million yuan in profits for Tianjin's May 1st Chemical Factory, where he worked. However, what truly elevated his reputation and earned him consecutive titles such as Tianjin's top labor model, outstanding party member, national outstanding youth ideological educator, and the "May 1st Labor Medal," and this time being recommended as a national labor model, was his bold initiative during the reform period. He took on the heavy responsibility of turning around three chemical factories in dire straits, along with his colleagues. He also summarized and created a "group management method" that combines the traditional reliance on the masses with modern management concepts, achieving remarkable results. When he served as the deputy director of the May 1st Chemical Factory, he completed the task of doubling production a year ahead of schedule. Amidst the celebratory drums for the completion of the contract, he quietly left to take on two loss-making enterprises—Haihe Plastics Factory and Labor Protection Rubber Factory. The former turned a profit in the same year, and the latter achieved a taxable income of 2 million yuan in just five months. His "group management method" attracted widespread attention and was promoted throughout Tianjin.

	"We are a generation of sacrifice and dedication"

	In the two factories managed by Zhang Shilun, workers admire him the most for his selflessness, dedicating himself entirely to his work, becoming thinner and even falling ill, yet never taking a single reward. He has the authority but does not use it for personal gain. For three generations, his family has lived in an 8-square-meter room. Now that the living conditions for all workers in the factory have improved, he only lives in two rooms, less than 30 square meters. His wife still works in another factory, doing the dirty and tiring job of sweeping the floors. His first directive as the director of the factory was: "This director does not have the habit of accepting gifts. No one in the entire factory is allowed to give me gifts for any reason, nor can they have gifts delivered through others. If there is any violation, it will be publicly criticized." Workers can see that Zhang Shilun is not here for money or housing but to improve the factory and benefit the workers.

	Zhang Shilun has high standards for himself and for party members. In a meeting, he said, "Remember, we are a generation of hard work and sacrifice. Being a party member means being prepared to dedicate oneself to hard work and sacrifice for a lifetime. Those who do not understand this should leave the factory."

	On one day in August of the previous year, Zhang Shilun was involved in a car accident and fractured his ribs. The next afternoon, he appeared at the factory's bidding conference, despite the pain, supported by others. During those days, the factory was very busy, and Zhang Shilun did not rest for a single day, working from his office bed. Thus, those who were feigning illness at home all came to work, and the factory's attendance rate increased dramatically. The power of example is boundless.

	Zhang Shilun turned around Haihe Plastics Factory in just three months, achieving a profit of 100,000 yuan, but he did not take a single cent. At Labor Protection Rubber Factory, apart from his basic salary, he did not take a single reward. He said, "Money cannot measure the breadth of a Communist Party member's heart. Compared to taking, giving makes one feel more fulfilled."

	Workers deeply respect Zhang Shilun's integrity and dedication.

	People know that Zhang Shilun had opportunities to get rich, but he gave them all up. He received 260 letters offering him high-paying jobs in other places. Some offered to buy him a house, some offered to give him a sleeper car, and some directly sent him hiring fees, all of which he declined. He also received several major awards: the first time, 900 yuan, which he all bought in national savings bonds; the second time, the state rewarded him 600 yuan for self-study success, which he donated entirely to the welfare of the disabled; the third time, he received 30,000 yuan in technology transfer fees for research achievements made in his spare time, which he donated entirely to the construction of Tianjin's outer ring road.

	Someone asked Zhang Shilun, "In this era of getting rich, don't you want to get rich?" Zhang Shilun smiled, "Of course, I want to! I even dream about it! But I must get rich after the people. A party cadre should think about the people's prosperity and the country's strength. If one's own pocket is full, how can one ask the people to work hard and overcome difficulties together?"

	"The fundamental way to manage a factory is to rely on the masses"

	Zhang Shilun created a nationally renowned "group management method," whose basic idea is to rely on all workers and respect the workers' status as masters. Zhang Shilun believes that to run a factory well, one must first believe that workers have managerial wisdom and talent, acknowledging that workers are not only producers but also post managers. They should truly participate in the factory's decision-making and management as masters. This requires making every worker see their potential and creativity and creating corresponding conditions to bring out this potential and creativity. Thus, the manager's individual contract becomes the entire factory's contract, making all workers, including the manager, and the factory a community of shared destiny.

	Zhang Shilun has a famous saying: "Develop the 'software' in every worker's mind." In the factories he manages, everyone has the right to choose their own position through competition, can volunteer, can engage in production, and can run a business. In the Labor Protection Factory, over 300 workers chose satisfactory positions, and enthusiasm was unprecedented. The factory's over 100 technical personnel had not developed new products for many years. Now, with free combination, free choice of positions, and self-selected research projects, they came up with 10 new projects in just one month. Through competition, over 20 former middle-level cadres were removed, and over 40 workers became middle-level cadres.

	Haihe Plastics Factory has a young worker who, while working, was more interested in small businesses. Zhang Shilun discovered his sales talent and hired him as a salesperson. As expected, he topped the sales list among sales personnel, transforming from a laggard to an advanced figure in the factory's operations.

	Labor Protection Rubber Factory is also a place with hidden talents. After Zhang Shilun took over, he posted a notice encouraging workers with specialties to take the lead and organize new multi-faceted business entities. In just a few days, many workers responded, with over 20 people becoming responsible for new entities. These entities include production groups, development groups, information groups, and audit groups. People showcased their talents, capturing information according to their specialties, procuring raw materials...

	More and more people care about and participate in the factory's management, changing the relationship between the manager and workers from "I decide, you execute; I command, you obey" to equal consultation, joint management, and shared risks. From one person making decisions to everyone contributing ideas, this improved the relationship between leaders and followers, igniting the workers' vitality. This is the power of developing "software."

	Zhang Shilun said, "The fundamental way to manage a factory is to rely on the masses. Even if a manager has great skills, without the support of the masses, they can only have grand plans but fail to achieve them."

	Workers say, "The feeling of being needed by the factory is a magical force that inspires every worker to release their potential."

### 开发“软件”的人——记全国劳动模范张世伦

    开发“软件”的人
    ——记全国劳动模范张世伦
    本报记者　孟晓云
    44岁的张世伦最早在天津出名，是因为他在8平方米的小阁楼里靠自学，艰苦奋斗，研制出67种规格的新产品，为他所在的天津五一化工厂创造了利润200万元。但是真正使他名声大振，并且连续获得了市特等劳动模范、优秀党员、全国优秀青年思想教育工作者称号和“五一”劳动奖章，这次又被推荐为全国劳模，则是因为他在改革中勇挑重担，于困境中先后和同伴们自荐承包了3个化工厂，并且总结创立了一个把党依靠群众的传统和现代经营管理意识结合起来的“群体经营工作法”，取得了显著成绩。他在五一化工厂任副厂长时，提前一年实现翻番。在欢庆承包任务胜利完成的锣鼓中，他悄然离去，自荐承包了两个亏损企业——海河塑料厂和劳保橡胶厂，前者当年扭亏为盈，后者仅用了5个月便创出利税200万元。他的“群体经营工作法”受到各方注意，并在天津市得到推广。
          “我们是牺牲奉献的一代”
    在张世伦所承包的两个厂子里，工人对他最佩服的是他没有私心，全身心地投入工作，累瘦了，累病了，从未拿过一分奖金。他有权而不以权谋私，一家三代人长期住在8平方米的小屋里。现在全厂职工住房改善了，他也只住上两间房，不足30平方米。他妻子仍在别的厂里当又脏又累的扫地工。他进厂的第一号厂长公告是：本厂长没有收礼习惯，全厂任何人不得以任何理由给本人送礼，也不得将礼物委托他人代转，如有违反，一律张榜公布批评。工人看得出来，张世伦来承包，一不为票子，二不为房子，为的是把厂子搞上去，为的是给职工谋福利。
    张世伦对自己、对党员要求很严。他在一次会上说，请大家记住，我们是艰苦奋斗、牺牲奉献的一代，当党员就要准备吃苦奉献一辈子，谁不认这个理，就离开这个厂。
    去年8月的一天，张世伦因车祸肋骨骨折，次日下午他强忍疼痛出现在厂里召开的竞争开标大会上，他是让人扶上台去的。那些日子，厂里正紧张着，张世伦没有休息一天，躺在办公室里办公。于是，那些在家泡病号的、小病大养的都来上班了，厂里出勤率剧增。榜样的力量是无穷的。
    张世伦承包海河塑料厂3个月后扭亏增盈，实现利润10万元，可他分文未取。在劳保橡胶厂，他除了基本工资外，没有拿过一分奖金。他说，金钱无法计算出一个共产党员的胸怀，与索取相比，奉献更使人充实。
    工人们对张世伦的廉洁奉献精神深为敬佩。
    人们知道，张世伦发财的机会不是没有，但他都一一放弃了。他收到过260封高薪聘请他到外地任职的信，有的单位许愿给他买一套住房，有的厂家要送他一辆卧车，有的直接寄来聘金，他都回绝了。他也得过几次重奖：第一次900元，他全买了国库券；第二次国家奖励他自学成才给600元，他全部捐献给残疾人福利事业；第三次是他利用业余时间研制的科研技术成果转让费3万元，全部捐献给天津外环线建设。
    有人问张世伦：“这年头讲致富，你真不想富么？”张世伦笑了：“怎么不想？做梦都想！但我必须富在群众之后。一个党员干部应该想人民富裕，念国家富强，如果自己先腰包塞饱，怎么要求群众去艰苦奋斗，共渡难关？”
    “治厂的根本在于依靠群众”
    张世伦创造过一个闻名全国的“群体经营工作法”，其基本思路就是依靠全体工人，尊重职工的主人翁地位。张世伦认为，要办好一个企业，首先必须相信职工有经营智慧和才干，确认职工既是生产者，同时又是岗位经营者，应该让职工真正以主人翁身份参与工厂的决策和管理。这就需要使每个工人都看到自己的潜力和创造性，并且创造相应条件把这种潜力和创造性激发出来。这样就把厂长个人的承包变成企业全员的承包，使包括厂长在内的全体职工和企业形成命运共同体。
    张世伦有句名言：“开发每个职工头脑中的软件。”在他所承包的厂子里，人人有权通过竞争选择自己的岗位，可以毛遂自荐，可以搞生产，可以办实体。劳保厂有300多名职工重新选择了满意的岗位，积极性空前提高。厂里100多名技术人员，多年来未开发出新产品。现在自由组合，自由选岗，自选科研项目，一个月就拿出10个新项目。通过竞争，原来20多名中层干部离岗，40多名工人当上中层干部。
    海河塑料厂有个青年工人，上班三天打鱼两天晒网，却热心倒腾小买卖。张世伦进厂后发现他有销售才干，招聘他为业务员。不出所料，他推销的数量在业务人员中名列前茅，从后进一跃成为厂里搞活经营的先进人物。
    劳保橡胶厂也是“藏龙卧虎”之地。张世伦进厂后贴出公告，号召有专长的职工出来挑大梁，组织新的多种经营的实体。没几天就有很多职工出来响应，有20多人成了新实体的负责人。这些实体中有生产组、开发组、信息组、审计组，人们各显神通，根据各自的特长捕捉信息，承揽原料……
    越来越多的人关心和参与企业的经营管理，这就使厂长与职工的关系由单纯的“我决策你执行、我指挥你服从”变为平等协商、共同经营、共担风险，由一人说了算变为人人献计献策，改善了领导与被领导的关系，激发了工人的活力。这就是开发“软件”的威力。
    张世伦说，治厂的根本在于依靠群众。一个厂长纵有天大的本事，如果失去了群众的支持，也只能是空有宏图而壮志难酬。
    工人们则说，被工厂需要的感觉是一种神奇的力量，它激发着每一个职工释放自己的潜能。
