Looking ahead to the bright future and facing the winding and bumpy road, we are laying a solid foundation and striding forward amidst the people's eager anticipation.

The leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council has continuously encouraged and supported the establishment of the Hainan Economic Special Zone. Our team has been continuously summarizing and improving through practice. Although the goal is clear, the path is not smooth. We must build the road well before the wheels can roll.

To strive to build a prosperous, wealthy, and civilized large economic special zone in a relatively short period is a good wish. To turn this wish into reality, we must have the conditions to realize it. The current conditions have a big gap with the good wish. Without working hard to create conditions, the wish will only remain a fantasy. We are progressing by laying a solid foundation.

Analyzing Hainan's conditions, recognizing its advantages and disadvantages, is the prerequisite for doing a good job in economic construction. Hainan has rich tropical crop resources, marine fishery resources, various mineral resources, unique tourism resources, a lot of land to be reclaimed, and a hardworking people. However, it is isolated in the sea, with a relatively low economic level, weak industrial foundation, insufficient infrastructure, poor economic benefits, backward technology, lack of funds, and historically more raw materials exported than invested.

Great potential and backward reality coexist, bright future and difficult reality contrast, high goals and low starting points are prominent. Most of Hainan's cadres understand this: not seeing the current difficulties will lead to unrealistic illusions, and not seeing the broad future will lead to loss of confidence. Seeking shortcuts will inevitably lead to a dead end, while laying a solid foundation is the broad road.

In the more than a year since the establishment of the province and the economic special zone, we have been working hard to lay a solid foundation and stride forward amidst the ups and downs.

Turning good intentions into specifics, we have formulated short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans, clarifying the goals and steps for advancement; combining the policies of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for Hainan with the actual situation, we have formulated specific regulations; we have planned and formulated various regulations in stages; we have established new leadership bodies, introduced urgently needed talents, and carried out a "small government, big society" institutional reform. We have vigorously developed electricity. Before and after the establishment of the province, we have increased the installed capacity of thermal power generation by 400,000 kilowatts, transforming Hainan from a power-short province to a power-surplus province; we have built two deep-water ports, Yangpu and Maqun, and expanded the ports of Bashan and Qinglan; we have improved and expanded the road network; we have added program-controlled telephones in Haikou and Sanya and opened automatic telephones in other counties and cities; we have increased the number of flights at Haikou Airport, etc., greatly improving the investment environment. In particular, the construction of the Phoenix International Airport in Sanya and the Daguangba Reservoir and Power Station has added more luster to the Hainan Special Zone.

Based on Hainan's actual situation, we have designated several economic development zones in the coastal areas near resources, implementing the method of "unified planning, block development, comprehensive compensation, and phased implementation." We have vigorously promoted internationally effective management methods, allowing investors to exercise their autonomy and enjoy preferential policies according to international customs under the premise of safeguarding China's sovereignty and implementing Chinese laws, and striving to attract foreign investment. We have established economic development zones in Haikou, Sanya, Yangpu, Bashan, Maqun, Qinglan, etc. Some are in the initial stage, and some have taken shape.

We have repeatedly educated the vast number of cadres and the people on the importance of unity, hard work, and carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions, and on the importance of laying a solid foundation and preventing short-term behavior. We have firmly grasped the task of building the Party into the strong leadership core of the Hainan Economic Special Zone. These efforts have been effective. The cadres and people of Hainan are full of confidence.

This year's agriculture has seen a bumper harvest of early-season grains, with a 31.91% increase over the same period last year and a record-high yield per unit area. Rubber, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, betel nut, cashew, mango, and other crops have also seen significant development. A number of development projects have been launched in agriculture. Industrial output value has increased by 18.4% compared to the same period last year, with a reduction in losses, increased taxes and profits, and improved economic benefits. The momentum of attracting foreign investment is good. Despite the impact of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the invested foreign merchants have not withdrawn, and new investors are continuously pouring in. Investors from inland areas have also increased. The negotiation and discussion of some major projects are actively proceeding. The development of Yangpu is proceeding smoothly.

The establishment of the Hainan Special Zone is not the same as the special zones established ten years ago in terms of specific climate, environment, and conditions, nor is it the same as other special zones in terms of geographical location. People understand and support it more than before, but it is inevitable that some people do not understand. In short, simply copying the experience of other special zones will not work, and it is unrealistic to expect the same speed in an area of over 30,000 square kilometers as in a special zone of 30 or 300 square kilometers.

There are many problems, but the future is bright. We must overcome difficulties through exploration, continuously summarize through practice, and strive unremittingly through breaking obstacles, and stride forward by laying a solid foundation.

### 在打基础中前进

　　在打基础中前进
　　中共海南省书记　许士杰
    纵观广阔光明的前景，面对坎坷曲折的道路，我们在人们翘首期待中打基础，迈快步。
    党中央、国务院领导不断给海南办经济特区以鼓舞与支持，我们的队伍在实践中不断总结与提高。目标虽然清晰，道路并非平坦，只有修好道路，四轮才能滚滚开动。
    争取在不很长的时间内，把海南建成繁荣、富裕、文明的大经济特区，这是个良好的愿望。要把愿望变成现实，必须具备实现愿望的条件。现有的条件与良好的愿望有大差距，不下苦功夫去创造条件，愿望只能是幻想。我们是在打基础中前进的。
    分析海南的条件，认识优势与劣势，这是搞好经济建设的前提。海南有丰富的热带作物资源、海洋水产资源、各种矿产资源、独特的旅游资源，待开垦地多，人民刻苦耐劳，但孤悬海南，经济水平较低，工业基础薄弱，基础设施不足，经济效益较差，技术落后，资金缺乏，历史上调出原材料较多而投入很少。
    巨大的潜力和落后的现实并存，光明的前景和困难的现实对照，目标较高与起点很低的矛盾突出。海南的干部大多数深知此理：看不到目前的困难就会产生不切实际的幻想，看不到广阔的前途就会失去信心。想走捷径必然此路不通，打好基础方为康庄大道。
    建省办经济特区一年多来，我们是在时热时冷中下大力气打基础迈步前进的。
    把良好的意愿具体化，制订了近期、中期和远期的规划，明确了前进的目标和步骤；把党中央、国务院给海南的政策，同实际相结合，制订出具体的规定；有计划地分期制订各种法规；建立了新的领导机构，引进了急需的短缺人才；作了“小政府，大社会”的体制改革。大力发展电力，建省前后共增加火力发电装机容量40万千瓦，由缺电省变为电力多余省；新建了洋浦、马村两个深水港，扩建了八所、清澜港；改造与拓展了公路网；海口、三亚程控电话的增设及其他县市自动电话的开通；海口机场航线的增加，等等，大大改善了投资环境。尤其是三亚凤凰国际机场和大广坝水库和电站的上马，更为海南特区增添了光彩。
    我们根据海南的实际情况，在靠近资源的沿海地带，划出若干经济开发区，实行“统一规划，成片开发，综合补偿，分期实施”的办法，放手推行国际上行之有效的管理办法，在维护我国的主权、执行我国法律的前提下，让投资者按国际惯例行使其自主权和享受优惠政策，努力吸引境外投资。已建立了海口、三亚、洋浦、八所、马村、清澜等经济开发区。有的在起步，有的初具规模。
    我们反复地对广大干部和人民群众进行团结一致、艰苦奋斗、发扬光荣的革命传统的教育，进行扎扎实实打基础、防止短期行为的教育。紧紧抓住把党建设成为海南经济特区的坚强领导核心的任务不放。这些工作，是卓有成效的。海南的干部和人民是满怀信心的。
  今年的农业，早造粮食大丰收，比去年同期增长31.91％，单产创历史最高纪录。橡胶、甘蔗、椰子、咖啡，槟榔、腰果、芒果等作物都有较大发展。农业上了一批开发项目。工业产值比去年同期增长18.4％，亏损面减少，税利增加，经济效益提高。引进外资的势头很好。尽管受到了北京反革命暴乱的影响，已投资的外商没撤走，新投资者源源涌入。内地来投资办企业者也有所增加。一些大项目的论证、洽谈，正在积极进行中。洋浦的开发在顺利进行。
    海南办特区，不是十年前办特区时那种特定的气候、环境和条件，也与其他特区的地理位置不同。人们比过去更理解、更支持了，但也难免有人不理解。总之，照搬别的特区的经验肯定是走不通的，想在一个3万多平方公里的地方取得像一个30或300平方公里的特区那样的速度是不切实际的。
    问题不少，前景光明。我们要在摸索中克服困难，在实践中不断总结，在破阻力中不懈奋斗，在打基础中健步前进。
