    Forty Years of Urban Transformation
    Beijing, an ancient city with a history of over 3,000 years and a capital for eight dynasties spanning 800 years, has undergone tremendous changes in just 40 years. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, through the hard work and struggle of the entire city's population, Beijing is striding forward with a new face towards a socialist modern city.

    The Capital's Functions Show Their Power

    Forty years ago, when the People's Government took over Beijing, the city's architectural highlights were the former imperial palaces, gardens, altars, and the mansions of nobles and officials, many of which were dilapidated and in disrepair. The vast majority of laboring people lived in dark, low, and dilapidated courtyards. Many parts of Beijing were desolate and in ruins, presenting a scene of decay and decline.

    As the capital of New China, Beijing is the political, cultural, and international and domestic exchange center of the country. This characteristic is different from other domestic cities. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, in accordance with the requirements of the capital's functions, adhered to the principle of serving the central government, serving international and domestic exchanges, and serving the people's lives, and carried out large-scale reconstruction of old Beijing.

    In the 1950s, during the first decade of New China, a batch of new buildings were completed one after another. The "Ten Great Buildings" represented by the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese History Museum, the Chinese Revolution Museum, the Nationalities Culture Palace, the Nationalities Hotel, Beijing Railway Station, the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, the Military Museum, the Overseas Chinese Building, the Beijing Workers' Stadium, and the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse stood tall. Tiananmen Square, after continuous reconstruction, complemented the surrounding magnificent buildings, making the world's largest square even more majestic and solemn. The contemporary political, cultural, and international exchange center was highly unified with the ancient capital's style, not only painting a magnificent and magnificent picture for Beijing but also arousing the admiration of the people across the country and demonstrating the grandeur and vitality of the People's Republic to the world.

    In the 1980s, Beijing's urban landscape changed rapidly, and construction developed at a rapid pace, significantly enhancing the capital's functions. The new "Ten Great Buildings" including the Beijing Library New Building, the Color TV Center, the Capital Airport Terminal, the International Hotel, the Great Wall Hotel, the Anti-Japanese War Memorial Hall, the Grand View Garden, the China International Exhibition Center, the China Theater, and the Dongsi Station of the Subway were completed one after another. Buildings with unique shapes are everywhere. In 40 years, the city's area has expanded from 109 square kilometers to 750 square kilometers, and further outward, Huangcun, Changping, Yanshan, and other new satellite cities have emerged. Beijing presents a thriving picture of socialist modernization.

    In 40 years, Beijing has built 25 museums, 21 public libraries, 360 cultural centers, and 65 theaters and cinemas. Various types of schools have increased by tens of times. From the modern high-tech-intensive Zhongguancun, the several-kilometer-long Academy Road, to the ancient-style Liulichang Cultural Street... all show the characteristics of the capital's cultural center.

    To meet the requirements of the international and domestic exchange center, Beijing has built a large number of international and domestic exchange facilities. It now has more than 100 modern high-level hotels such as the Capital Hotel and the Wangfujing Hotel, as well as a large number of hotels and restaurants. The ability and service level to accommodate domestic and foreign guests have been significantly improved, and the previous difficulties in accommodating domestic and foreign guests have been fundamentally alleviated.

    Built Seven Old Beijings in 40 Years

    In just 40 years, Beijing has built a total of 150 million square meters of various types of buildings, far exceeding the total of 800 years of construction, equivalent to seven old Beijings.

    In recent years, Beijing has completed nearly 10 million square meters of various types of buildings annually, ranking first among major cities in the world.

    The People's Government has adhered to the principle of serving the people's lives and has vigorously built residential buildings and supporting service facilities. Hundreds of thousands of households have moved from low, old houses to new residences, and millions of Beijing people have personally felt the great changes in Beijing. In 1949, the city had only 13.54 million square meters of civilian housing. By the end of 1988, the city's residential housing had reached 82.65 million square meters. In 40 years, Beijing has built 75 million square meters of new housing, which is 5.4 times the total residential area of the city at the beginning of liberation. Especially in recent years, the annual housing construction area has reached about 5 million square meters. There are more than 120 new residential areas with an area of more than 30,000 square meters, scattered throughout the four cities of Beijing. 40 years ago, Beijing's urban population was less than 2 million, with an average residential area of only 4.75 square meters per person, and many families had three generations living in one room and four generations under one roof; 40 years later, Beijing's urban population has expanded to more than 6 million, but the average residential area has increased to 7.17 square meters. The municipal government, despite financial constraints, has invested 14.92 billion yuan in housing alone in the past 40 years.

    To ensure the health of the people, 400 new hospitals have been built in the city in the past 40 years, and 45 existing hospitals have been reconstructed and expanded. Large-scale residential areas have been planted with flowers and trees, with a comfortable environment and supporting service facilities, which is a world apart from the dilapidated alleys of the past. The number of commercial service outlets in the city reached 111,000 last year, which is 5.6 times that at the beginning of liberation. The total retail sales of social commodities increased from 280 million yuan at the beginning of liberation to 23.43 billion yuan in 1988, and many inconveniences in people's lives have been greatly alleviated.

    Great Development in Municipal Facilities

    Water, electricity, gas, heat, roads, communications, and postal services are the foundations for the survival and development of a city and are the prerequisites for Beijing to play its role as a political, cultural, and international exchange center. In the past 40 years, the Party and the government have made unremitting efforts for this, investing 18 billion yuan in basic infrastructure construction. Especially in the past 10 years, Beijing has made great efforts to lay the foundation for a modern city, significantly enhancing the city's functions.

    In 1949, Beijing had only two water plants with a daily water supply capacity of only 86,000 tons, and less than one-third of the residents had tap water. In 40 years, the city has built 20 new water plants with a daily water supply capacity of 1.888 million tons, and 100% of the urban residents have tap water. The city's power supply capacity has also been greatly enhanced, with the city's power consumption increasing from 200 million kWh at the beginning of liberation to 13.79 billion kWh. Most Beijing residents have bid farewell to small coal stoves for cooking and heating. Starting from zero, 1.65 million households now use coal gas, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and the gasification rate for urban residents' cooking has reached more than 85.5%. Various forms of urban heating areas are expanding, and 80% of residential buildings have heating. The previously scarce telephones have now begun to enter thousands of households, and the total capacity of the city's telephone exchange has exceeded 320,000 lines, with 236,000 urban telephone users.

    In 40 years, Beijing has built 2,900 kilometers of urban roads, which is 500 kilometers longer than the distance from Beijing to Guangzhou. Old Beijing, with the Forbidden City as the center, had a chessboard-like road layout, which seriously hindered the development of modern city traffic. After years of transformation, especially the accelerated reconstruction and expansion in the 1980s, the road layout has undergone new changes. After the completion of the spacious and fast Second Ring Road, the 48-kilometer-long Third Ring Road has also been opened to traffic, and the North Fourth Ring Road is currently under construction. Along with it, the extended Chang'an Street, Deqing Road, Changping Road, Academy Road, Jingmi Road, Jingshi Expressway, and other roads form a new radial pattern. Modern overpasses are scattered throughout the city, with as many as 23 urban overpasses alone. Driving along the Second Ring Road, among the green shade and blooming flowers, a series of overpasses are like bright pearls inlaid on the "jade necklace." In 1984, the San Yuan Bridge on the Third Ring Road was completed and opened to traffic, with the largest scale in the country. Now, more than ten overpasses have been opened to traffic on the South Second Ring Road, including the beautiful and spacious Yuqing Bridge, which is much larger than the San Yuan Bridge.

    The Capital is Blooming Everywhere

    In the past 40 years, due to the vigorous promotion of afforestation, planting flowers and grasses, and greening and beautifying the environment, Beijing's ecological environment has undergone significant changes. In the city, the greening length of roads and rivers has increased from 87 kilometers to more than 2,000 kilometers. The streets of Fuxingmen, Fuchengmen, the Second Ring Road, the Third Ring Road, and more than 60 other urban roads have been built into avenues with flowers in three seasons and evergreen trees in four seasons. A large number of parks and street gardens have been newly built and expanded. Many classical gardens have been repaired and protected. The number of parks has increased from 7 at the beginning of liberation to 62. The number of various trees has increased to more than 17 million, the greening coverage rate has reached 25%, and the per capita public green space has reached 5.8 square meters. In the suburbs, 40,000 hectares of forest and economic forests have been created, basically achieving the initial greening of villages, gullies, roads, and canals, and the forestation of farmland. The forest coverage rate in the suburbs has increased from 1.3% at the beginning of liberation to 23.7%. From the plains to the mountains, a multi-level green barrier has been formed to prevent wind and sand and improve the microclimate, greatly reducing the harm of wind and sand. Beijing has become greener and more beautiful.

    Hosting the Asian Games for the First Time

    The 11th Asian Games, which will be held in Beijing in 1990, is the largest international sports event that Beijing and our country have hosted since liberation. A total of 33 venues have been newly built and reconstructed, and 30,000 builders are working day and night to ensure that 17 venues are completed or put into use. All major venues and supporting municipal projects will be completed by the end of this year. Hosting the Asian Games will fully demonstrate our country's new level of political, economic, scientific, and cultural strength, enhance friendship with the people of various countries, and improve our country's international prestige. Civilized, beautiful, and hospitable Beijing will welcome this grand event with a new look.

    四十年城市巨变
    建城已有3000余年历史、五朝建都也达800年之久的古城北京，在短短40年里，发生了翻天覆地的变化。在中国共产党、人民政府领导下，经过全市人民辛勤劳动，艰苦奋斗，北京正以崭新的面貌，向着社会主义现代化城市阔步前进。
            首　都　功　能　显　威　力
    40年前，当人民政府接管北平城时，这里的建筑精华只是昔日的皇宫、禁苑、坛庙以及皇亲国戚、达官显要们的私宅府第，多已年久失修，黯淡破旧；广大劳动人民则生活在阴暗低矮、残砖断瓦的杂院里。北平许多地方凋零破败，满目疮痍，一片衰落景象。
    作为新中国的首都，北京是全国的政治中心、文化中心和国际国内交往中心。这一性质同国内其他城市是不同的。市委、市政府按照首都功能的要求，坚持为中央服务、为国际国内交往服务、为人民生活服务的方针，对旧北京进行了大规模的改建。
    五十年代，当新中国处于第一个十年的时期，一批批新建筑就已相继落成。以人民大会堂、中国历史博物馆中国革命博物馆、民族文化宫、民族饭店、北京火车站、全国农业展览馆、军事博物馆、华侨大厦、北京工人体育场、钓鱼台国宾馆为代表的“十大建筑”拔地而起；天安门广场经过不断改建，与周围气势磅礴的建筑相互映衬，更显出这世界最大广场的恢宏壮阔、庄严神圣。当代中国政治、文化、国际交往中心同古都风貌在这里得到了高度的统一，不但为北京绘出了雄伟壮丽的画卷，更加引起全国人民的向往，而且向全世界显示了人民共和国的宏伟力量和蓬勃生机。
    八十年代，北京城市面貌更是日新月异，建设飞速发展，首都功能大大加强。北京图书馆新馆、彩电中心、首都机场候机楼、国际饭店、长城饭店、抗日战争纪念馆、大观园、中国国际展览中心、中国剧院、地铁东四十条车站等新的“十大建筑”相继建成，造型别致的新建筑比比皆是。40年来，城市范围从109平方公里拓展到750平方公里，再向外延伸，则是黄村、昌平、燕山等新崛起的卫星城。北京，向人们展现了一幅社会主义现代化的欣欣向荣图景。
    40年来，北京兴建各类博物馆25座、公共图书馆21个、文化馆360个、影剧院65座；各类学校成倍成十倍增多；体育场馆遍布城乡。从现代化高科技密集的中关村，绵延数公里的学院路，到古色古香的琉璃厂文化街……都显示了首都文化中心的特色。
    为了适应国际国内交往中心的要求，北京兴建了大批国际国内交往设施，现已拥有首都宾馆、王府饭店等百座现代高级宾馆，以及大批旅馆、饭店，接待海内外宾客的能力和服务水平明显提高，以往国内外宾客住店难的状况得到了根本缓解。
            建　了　7　个　北　平　城
    在短短的40年里，北京建设的各类房屋总面积达到了1.5亿平方米，大大超过了800年建设的总和，相当于7个旧北平。
    近几年，北京每年竣工各类房屋总面积近1000万平方米，居世界各大城市之冠。
    人民政府坚持为人民生活服务的宗旨，大力兴建了居民住宅和配套服务设施。上百万户从低矮旧房迁入新居的数百万北京人，亲身感受到了北京的巨大变化。1949年，全市只有民房1354万平方米，1988年底，全市居民住宅已达8265万平方米。40年来，北京新建住宅7500多万平方米，是解放初期全市住宅总面积的5.4倍。特别是近几年来，每年住宅建设面积达500万平方米左右。3万平方米以上的新兴住宅小区达到120多处，遍布北京四城。40年前，北京城市人口不足200万，人均住宅面积只有4.75平方米，很多人家三代一室、四世同堂；40年后的今天，北京城市人口已膨胀到600多万，而人均住宅面积却上升为7.17平方米。市政府在财力不足的情况下，仅住宅一项，40年来投资就达149.2亿元。
    为了保障人民身体健康，40年来全市新建医院400座，对原有的45家医院也进行了改建扩建。大批住宅区内栽花植树，环境舒适，服务设施配套，与解放前的破屋陋巷相比，真有天渊之别。全市商业服务业网点去年达到11.1万个，相当于解放初的5.6倍，社会商品零售总额解放初只有2.8亿元，1988年猛增到234.3亿元，群众生活中的诸多不便大大缓解了。
    市政设施建设大发展
    水、电、气、热、道路、通讯、邮政等市政设施，是城市赖以生存和发展的基础，是北京发挥政治、文化、国际交往中心作用的前提条件。40年来，党和政府为此作了不懈的努力，用于基础设施建设的投资达180亿元。特别是近10年，北京市下大力气为现代化城市打家底、奠基础，大大增强了首都的城市功能。
    1949年，北京只有两座水厂，日供水能力不过8.6万吨，吃自来水的居民不足1／3。40年间，全市新建了20座水厂，日供水能力达到188.8万吨，城区居民100％吃上了自来水。城市供电能力也大大增强，全市用电量从解放初期的2亿千瓦小时，猛增到137.9亿千瓦小时。绝大多数北京人烧水做饭告别了小煤炉，从零开始，现已发展煤气、天然气、液化石油气用户165万户，城市居民炊事燃气化率达85.5％以上。城市各种形式的供热面积正在不断扩大，已有80％的居民住宅用上了暖气。过去少得可怜的电话，如今开始进入千家万户，全市电话交换机总容量已超过32万门，市内电话用户达23.6万户。
    40年来，北京共修建城市道路2900多公里，比北京到广州还长500多公里。旧北京以紫禁城为中心，道路呈棋盘式格局，严重阻碍现代城市交通的发展。经过多年改造，特别是80年代加快改建、扩建，道路格局出现了新变化。在宽敞、快速的二环路建成之后，长48公里的三环路也已通车，目前又在修建北四环路。与此相衔的长安街延长线、德清路、昌平路、学院路、京密路、京石高速公路等，形成了四面辐射式的新格局。现代化的立交桥已遍布全城，仅城市立交桥就达23座之多。沿二环路驱车疾行，在绿荫环抱、鲜花簇拥之中，一座座立交桥宛若颗颗明珠，镶嵌在“翡翠项链”上。1984年，三环路上三元桥建成通车，规模居全国之首。如今，南外二环又有十几座立交桥通车，其中，美丽舒展的玉蜓桥比三元桥又大得多了。
        京城无处不飞花
    40年来，由于大力开展植树造林、种花种草，绿化美化环境，北京市的生态环境面貌发生了显著的变化。在城市，道路、河道绿化长度由87公里骤增到2000多公里，复兴门、阜城门二环、三环等60多条城市道路建成了三季有花、四季常青的林荫道。新建、扩建了大批的公园和街心花园。众多的古典园林得到了修葺和保护。公园由解放初的7个增加到了62个。各种树木已增加到1700多万株，绿化覆盖率达到25％，人均公共绿地面积达到5.8平方米。在郊区，营造了片林、经济林4万多公顷，基本实现了村庄、沟、路、渠的初步绿化和农田林网化。郊区的林木覆盖率，已由解放初期的1.3％增加到23.7％。从平原到山区，形成了多层次的防风、防沙、改造小气候的绿色屏障，风沙危害大大减少。北京变绿了，变得更美了。
      头一回承办亚运会
    1990年将在北京举行的第11届亚运会，是解放40年来北京也是我国头一回承办的规模最大的国际体育盛会。新建改建的场馆达33个，3万名建设者正在夜以继日紧张施工，已有17个场馆竣工或投入使用，各主要场馆和配套的市政工程都将在今年底完工。举办亚运会，将充分显示我国政治、经济实力和科学文化等新水平，增进我国同各国人民的友谊，提高我国的国际威望。文明、美丽、好客的北京，将以崭新的风貌迎接这一盛会。　（张红新）（附图片）
