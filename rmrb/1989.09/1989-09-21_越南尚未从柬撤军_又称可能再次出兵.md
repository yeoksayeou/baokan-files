Vietnam has not yet withdrawn from Cambodia and may send troops again

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th: On September 19th, Nguyen Van Tai, spokesman for the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense, said at a press conference in Hanoi that after Vietnam completes its withdrawal of troops from Cambodia next week, if the resistance forces of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front threaten the survival of the Phnom Penh government, Vietnam may send troops to Cambodia again.

Nguyen Van Tai pointed out that the armed forces of the Phnom Penh government, including militia, have more than 300,000 people and have the ability to defend themselves. Although the guerrilla resistance forces have only 50,000 people, the guerrilla forces still have the possibility of winning. If the Phnom Penh government requests external support, then Vietnam will announce its decision to send troops to Cambodia.

It is noted that the Vietnamese authorities claim that they will withdraw the last batch of 16,000 troops from Cambodia between September 22nd and 26th without international supervision and verification. Such a withdrawal is difficult to gain international recognition. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chairman of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, recently pointed out that even if Vietnam announces the withdrawal of the so-called last batch of troops, there are still 100,000 to 130,000 Vietnamese troops stationed in Cambodia.

    越南尚未从柬撤军
    又称可能再次出兵
    据新华社北京9月20日电　越南国防部发言人阮文泰9月19日在河内举行的记者招待会上说，越南下周完成从柬埔寨撤军工作后，如果民柬抵抗力量威胁到金边政权的生存，越南可能再次出兵柬埔寨。
    阮文泰指出，金边政权武装力量包括民兵在内有30多万人，有能力保卫自己。游击队抵抗力量虽然只有5万人，但游击队仍有可能获胜。如果金边政权要求外来支援，那时越南就会宣布出兵柬埔寨的决定。
    人们注意到，越南当局声称将从9月22日到26日撤出它在柬埔寨的最后一批军队16000人是在没有国际监督和核实的情况下进行的。这种撤军难以得到国际社会承认。民柬主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王前不久指出，即使越南宣布撤出所谓最后一批军队，但在柬埔寨境内仍然驻有10到13万越南军队。
