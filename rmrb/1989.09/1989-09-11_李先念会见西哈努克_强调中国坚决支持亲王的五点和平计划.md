Li Xiannian Meets Sihanouk, Emphasizes China's Firm Support for the Prince's Five-Point Peace Plan

	BEIJING, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian met today with Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, and his wife, Princess Monik, at the State Guesthouse in Beijing. The two old friends had a warm and lengthy conversation.

	Sihanouk said that as the Chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, he remains steadfast in his support for the five-point peace plan he proposed. He believes this plan serves the interests of the Cambodian people and is aimed at maintaining peace in Cambodia. He stressed the need for a transitional period, led by him, with the participation of all four parties, to establish a temporary united government before the elections. He emphasized that all four parties should have equal power and shared responsibilities.

	Sihanouk expressed skepticism about Vietnam's announced withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia by the end of September. He pointed out that Vietnam still has a large number of military personnel hidden within the Khmer Rouge forces and has not resolved the issue of illegal Vietnamese immigrants.

	Li Xiannian praised Sihanouk's firm stance at the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia. He reiterated China's firm support for Sihanouk's five-point peace plan. Li said that Sihanouk is a great patriot who has left a deep impression on the Cambodian people and the world. He has fought resolutely for Cambodia's true independence and neutrality, and his proposals are just.

	Li spoke of the long-standing friendship between China and Cambodia, noting that Chinese leaders and Sihanouk have had a friendship spanning several decades. This traditional friendship was established by Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Deng Xiaoping with Sihanouk. Although new generations of leaders have taken over, Li believes they will continue to uphold the wishes of the older generation of Chinese revolutionaries and maintain and develop the traditional friendship with the Cambodian people.

	Finally, Li Xiannian warmly invited Sihanouk to stay in Beijing to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Sihanouk accepted the invitation with pleasure, expressing his desire to celebrate this joyous occasion with the Chinese leadership and people.

	After the meeting, Li hosted a banquet for Sihanouk and Princess Monik. Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and others attended the meeting and banquet.

　　李先念会见西哈努克
　  强调中国坚决支持亲王的五点和平计划
    本报北京9月11日讯　记者孙毅报道：全国政协主席李先念今天下午在钓鱼台养源斋亲切会见了中国人民的老朋友、民柬主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和夫人莫尼克公主。两位老朋友见面分外亲切，进行了长时间的交谈。
    西哈努克亲王说，作为民柬主席，我仍然坚定不移地坚持我提出的五点和平计划，我认为这个计划是符合柬埔寨人民利益，是从维护柬埔寨和平利益出发的。他表示，坚决主张在越南撤军之后到大选之前的过渡时期，建立一个在他领导之下的、四方参加的临时联合政府。四方应该是有平等的权力和共同的责任。他说，越南单方面宣布今年9月底从柬埔寨撤出它的全部军队，但是不相信越南会真正地从柬埔寨撤军。因为它还有大量的军事人员隐藏在韩桑林的军队内，还有大量的越南非法移民的问题没有解决。
    李先念主席高度赞扬了西哈努克亲王在不久前举行的柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议中所表现的坚定立场。他表示，中国坚决支持西哈努克亲王的五点和平计划。李主席说，亲王是一个伟大的爱国主义者，在柬埔寨人民和世界人民的心目中都留下了良好的印象，为柬埔寨的真正独立、中立的正义事业进行了坚决的斗争，亲王的主张也是公正的。
    在谈到中柬两国友谊时，李主席说，我国领导人和亲王已经有几十年的交情，我们两国的传统友谊是毛泽东主席、周恩来总理以及邓小平主席和亲王共同建立起来的，虽然现在我们换了新一代领导人，但我相信他们会继承中国老一辈革命家的意愿，继续保持和发展同柬埔寨人民的传统友谊。
    最后，李先念主席热情地邀请西哈努克亲王留在北京参加中华人民共和国建国40周年的庆祝活动。西哈努克亲王欣然接受。他表示将同中国领导人和中国人民一起庆祝中国人民的这个喜庆日子。
    会见后，李主席设宴招待了西哈努克亲王和莫尼克公主。钱其琛外长等参加了会见和宴会。
