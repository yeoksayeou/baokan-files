As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches, the reporter visited the home of Paul Wanner, Honorary Doctor, Vice Chairman of the Friendship Association of Peoples of All Countries in the German Democratic Republic, and Chairman of the GDR-China Friendship Committee.

Dr. Wanner is 84 years old. This veteran of several decades of revolutionary struggle is approachable and kind. He warmly invited me to sit in his study. The study is filled with exquisite Chinese crafts, and a German edition of the "Complete Works of Marx and Engels" is prominently displayed. He and his wife specially pointed out to me a set of fine Chinese porcelain wineware and a set of coffee sets in a glass cabinet. These were gifts from Premier Zhou Enlai during his time as ambassador to China.

Wanner served as the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China from 1958 to 1961. Those were unforgettable years. He recalled that at that time, he had a close relationship with Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping, and had many conversations with them. In his interactions with them, he felt that China and the German Democratic Republic were mutually trusting and understanding. He told me about an incident: After the German Democratic Republic established diplomatic relations with China, the embassy was located in the former German embassy building from the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. The GDR considered this a symbol of China's recognition of the legal status of the GDR government. In 1958, the Chinese government decided to build a new embassy area. Ambassador Wanner went to see Premier Zhou Enlai and proposed that the GDR embassy hoped to remain in its original location until the GDR was widely recognized in the world. Premier Zhou immediately agreed to his request.

As an old friend of the Chinese people, Wanner is very pleased with the great achievements China has made in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said that in the past 40 years, China has certainly had problems, but the achievements are indeed great. China's economy has developed rapidly, and compared to 40 years ago, the country's appearance has changed greatly. He believes that China is moving forward on the right path and will definitely be able to solve its own problems.

This year is not only the 40th anniversary of China's National Day but also the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic and the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The German Democratic Republic will hold a series of celebrations for this. As the chairman of the GDR-China Friendship Committee, Wanner actively participated in the preparation of these celebrations. He said that the relationship between the German Democratic Republic and China is very good now. He emphasized that there is still great potential for the further development of economic relations between the two countries, not only in trade but also in production and technology.

After describing the struggle history of the German Democratic Republic, Wanner said that the German Democratic Republic is concerned about the situation of all socialist countries, but each socialist country is an independent country and should handle its own problems. Some people say that the GDR does not carry out reforms, but in fact, the GDR has been continuously carrying out reforms since its establishment. Some things that the GDR has had for a long time, such as multi-party cooperation and individual economy. The GDR does not intend to copy some of the practices of others.

This old Communist Party member, who joined the party in 1926, is keenly aware of the "peaceful evolution" attempts of the Western bourgeoisie. He said that due to the victory of socialism in the world, even the United States now knows that it cannot attack socialist countries by force. The Western bourgeoisie now hopes to produce counter-revolutionary forces within socialist countries to oppose democratic and progressive forces, hoping to intervene at that time. They are not only dreaming but also helping the opposition within socialist countries. He also said that now some young people do not understand what capitalism is like and blindly admire the West. Therefore, the education of the younger generation cannot be neglected.

Comrade Wanner has been dedicated to the revolution since his youth. After the founding of the German Democratic Republic, he held important positions such as Secretary of the Central Committee, Minister of National Education, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. Now, although he is advanced in age, his revolutionary spirit is as strong as ever, and he is still working hard to develop the friendship between the people of the German Democratic Republic and the people of China, and the people of the world.

    “中国正沿着正确道路前进”
     ——访保尔·汪戴尔名誉博士
     本报记者　许宏治
    在中华人民共和国成立40周年光辉节日即将到来的时候，记者前往民主德国各国人民友好协会副会长、民德——中国友好委员会主席保尔·汪戴尔名誉博士家中拜访。
    汪戴尔名誉博士今年84岁。这位有着几十年革命斗争历史的老前辈平易近人，和蔼可亲。他热情地让我到书房就座。书房里陈放着不少中国的精美工艺品，德文版的《马克思恩格斯全集》摆在显著的位置。他和夫人特意把玻璃橱柜里一套中国细瓷酒具和一套咖啡具指给我看。那是当年他在中国当大使时，周恩来总理赠送给他的。
    汪戴尔于1958—1961年担任民主德国驻中国大使。那是十分难忘的岁月。他回忆说，当时他和毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平等中国领导人关系亲密，曾多次同他们交谈。在和他们的接触中，他感到中国和民主德国是彼此信任、相互理解的。他告诉我这样一件往事：民主德国同中国建交后，使馆设在清末民初原德国驻华使馆旧址。民德认为这是中国承认民主德国政府合法地位的一种象征。1958年，中国政府决定修建新的使馆区。汪戴尔大使去找周恩来总理，提出民德使馆希望能留在原址，直到民主德国在世界上被广泛承认。周总理当即同意了他的要求。
    作为中国人民的老朋友，汪戴尔对中华人民共和国成立40年来取得的伟大成就感到非常高兴。他说，40年来中国当然不是没有问题，但成就的确很大。中国的经济发展迅速，和40年前相比，国家的面貌发生了很大变化。他认为，中国正在沿着正确的道路前进，一定能自己解决自己的问题。
    今年不仅是中国国庆40周年，而且也是民主德国成立40周年，又是两国建交40周年。民主德国将为此举行一系列庆祝活动。汪戴尔作为民德—中国友好委员会主席，积极参与了这些庆祝活动的筹备工作。他说，现在民主德国和中国之间的关系非常好。他强调两国之间经济关系的进一步发展还有很大潜力，不仅在贸易方面，而且在生产、科技等方面也可加强合作。
    汪戴尔在叙述了民主德国的奋斗历史后说，民主德国对所有社会主义国家的情况都很关心，但是每个社会主义国家都是独立的国家，应该自己处理自己的问题。有人说民德不搞改革，其实，民德从成立以来一直在不断地进行改革。有些东西民德是早就有的，如多党合作、个体经济等。民德不打算照搬别人的一些做法。
    这位1926年入党的老共产党员清醒地注意到西方资产阶级的“和平演变”企图。他说，由于社会主义在世界上的胜利，现在甚至连美国也知道，不能用武力来进攻社会主义国家了。西方资产阶级现在把希望寄托于在社会主义国家内部产生反革命力量，以此反对民主、进步力量，指望那时他们再进行干涉。他们不仅在幻想，而且在帮助社会主义国家内部的反对派。他还说，现在有些年青人不了解资本主义是怎么回事，盲目崇拜西方。因此，对年青一代的教育不可忽视。
    汪戴尔同志从年青时起就投身革命。民主德国成立后，他曾担任过党中央书记、国民教育部长、外交部副部长等重要职务。现在，他虽年事已高，但革命精神不减当年，还在为发展民主德国人民同中国人民、同世界各国人民的友谊辛勤操劳。
