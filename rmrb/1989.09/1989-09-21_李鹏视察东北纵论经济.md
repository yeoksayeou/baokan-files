Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, recently inspected the three northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He emphasized that the idea of agriculture as the foundation must not be shaken, and grain production must be firmly grasped. He also stressed that township enterprises should be supported and guided, and should not compete with large enterprises for raw materials and energy. He pointed out that large and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the national economy and must be well-managed. The contract responsibility system for enterprises should continue, but it must be continuously improved and perfected. The opening up to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is an important part of China's opening-up policy.

From September 10 to 19, Premier Li Peng visited several places in the four provinces and autonomous regions of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Liaoning. He conducted investigations and research on issues related to agriculture, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, border trade, and other matters.

This year, the Northeast experienced a severe drought, the worst in many years. Premier Li Peng was deeply concerned about the agricultural production situation. He visited the Chaoyang Township in Shuangcheng City, Heilongjiang Province, the Chaoyang District in Changchun City, the Dongling District in Shenyang City, and the Shijiahe Town in Sifatun District. He inspected the growth of corn, soybeans, rice, and other late-season crops and entrusted He Kang, the Minister of Agriculture, to further inspect the disaster situation in rural areas. He demanded strengthening the late-season management of late-season crops, ensuring a good harvest, and minimizing the losses caused by the drought. He also called for organizing farmers to engage in sideline businesses and production self-rescue to boost morale.

Premier Li Peng said, "China has a population of 1.1 billion. The agricultural issue is always a big issue in our country. The idea of agriculture as the foundation must not be shaken, and grain production must be firmly grasped. The yield of our crops is not at its limit. As long as we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the farmers and practice scientific farming, there is still great potential for increased production. In the future, from the central government to local governments, we must invest more effort in agriculture, increase investment in agriculture, and support the development of agriculture. This winter and next spring, we must fully mobilize the masses, concentrate manpower and material resources to carry out basic agricultural construction, further improve agricultural production conditions, and, on the basis of consolidating the household contract responsibility system, appropriately develop moderately scaled operations and establish agricultural service systems and various forms of collective rural economies."

Regarding township enterprises, Li Peng said that township enterprises should still be developed, but they should be based on rural resources and should not compete with large enterprises for raw materials and energy, so as to make better use of the country's limited resources.

Premier Li Peng inspected the Northeast Light Metal Processing Plant, Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Huolin Rubber Factory, Mudanjiang Second Power Plant, and Liaoyang Petrochemical Fiber Company, among other large and medium-sized enterprises. He held talks with the managers and party secretaries of 30 large and medium-sized enterprises, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, to understand the production, management, and living conditions of the workers, and to widely solicit their opinions on enterprise contracting. Li Peng said that the state should create a relatively good external environment for large and medium-sized enterprises. Large and medium-sized enterprises should also strengthen management, technological transformation, and internal structural adjustments, strive to improve product quality, reduce consumption, especially reduce the consumption of raw materials, and make more contributions to the country.

Li Peng said that since the implementation of the contract responsibility system, the achievements are the main ones. The contract system has played an active role in promoting production development, ensuring state financial revenue, enterprise self-renewal and transformation, and improving the living conditions of workers. Now, some contract responsibility systems have expired, and some are about to expire, facing the question of what to do next. Our policy should be to maintain policy stability. Those that have not expired should not be changed, and those that have expired can continue to be extended until new methods are found. Especially during the period of rectification and adjustment, the external conditions of enterprises have changed greatly, and there are many difficulties. Continuing the contract system is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of enterprise leaders and workers, turning pressure into motivation, and overcoming difficulties to maintain the stable development of production.

Li Peng pointed out that the contract system also has some imperfections, mainly in handling the relationship between the interests of the state, enterprises, and individual workers, and the relationship between long-term and short-term interests. Some drawbacks are not necessarily caused by the contract system itself, but are triggered by it, such as the short-term behavior of enterprises and unfair distribution. As long as the leadership at all levels and enterprise leaders have the correct guiding ideology and take appropriate measures, they can eliminate the drawbacks and make the contract system play a greater role.

Premier Li Peng inspected the border cities of Manzhouli and Suifenhe. When talking about border trade, Li Peng said that China implements an open policy, facing all countries in the world. The opening up to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is also an important part of China's open policy. The economic characteristics and resource situations of China and the Soviet Union are different, and there is a certain complementarity and interchangeability in their economies. Sino-Soviet economic and technological cooperation has a broad prospect. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations has created conditions for further developing Sino-Soviet economic cooperation and giving full play to each other's advantages. The development of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation is based on equality and mutual benefit.

Wherever he went, Premier Li Peng was most concerned about three figures: the average income of farmers, the average income of workers, and the price increase index. He said these three figures are directly related to the lives of the people. After implementing the "383 Project" to control prices, Heilongjiang has seen prices stabilize and even decrease, and the people are relatively satisfied. Li Peng said that this work should be continued. In the previous period, the main focus was on vegetable gardens and ensuring the supply of vegetables. The key was to ensure the supply of staple vegetables. With an adequate supply of staple vegetables, market vegetable prices can be stabilized.

Li Peng said that in the past few years, total demand exceeded total supply, making the overall economic development uncoordinated. During the period of rectification and adjustment, we must be prepared to have a few years of tight living conditions, propose practical measures, fully mobilize the masses, and overcome the current temporary difficulties.

Li Peng pointed out that it is no longer possible to develop at the high speed of previous years. After the compression of basic construction, the development speed of the processing industry serving basic construction will also slow down, and the consumption fund will also decrease accordingly. This is a painful process, but it is also an opportunity for us to carry out structural adjustments, strengthen enterprise management, strengthen technological transformation, improve product quality, and thus improve enterprise economic benefits.

During the inspection, Premier Li Peng listened to the reports of the four provinces and autonomous regions and made several speeches on the current work.

On September 19, Premier Li Peng concluded his inspection and returned to Beijing. Accompanying Premier Li Peng on the inspection were Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission Ye Qing, Director-General of the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center Ma Hong, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Li Lanqing.

    李鹏视察东北纵论经济
    农业为基础思想不能动摇坚持抓好粮食生产
    乡镇企业一要扶持二要引导不应争原料能源
    大中型企业是国民经济骨干力量一定要办好
    企业承包制要继续搞下去但要不断改进完善
    据新华社北京9月20日电　（记者陈乃进）中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏近日在东北三省和内蒙古自治区调查研究时指出：以农业为基础的思想不能动摇，要坚定不移地抓好粮食生产；对乡镇企业一要扶持，二要引导；大中型企业是国民经济的骨干力量，一定要把大中型企业办好；企业承包责任制是改革的产物，要继续搞下去，但要不断改进和完善；对苏联东欧的开放是我国开放的一个组成部分。
    9月10日至19日，李鹏总理先后到黑龙江、内蒙古、吉林、辽宁4个省、自治区的一些地方，就农业、国营大中型企业、边境贸易等问题进行了调查研究。
    东北今年遇到多年没有过的伏旱，李鹏总理对农业生产情况十分关切，他先后到黑龙江省双城市朝阳乡、长春市朝阳区城西乡、沈阳市东陵区白塔堡乡和苏家屯区十里河镇，察看了玉米、大豆、水稻等大秋作物的生长情况，并委托同行的农业部长何康同志到农村进一步察看灾情。他要求加强大秋作物的后期管理，搞好秋收，争取颗粒回家，尽力减少伏旱带来的损失。要组织农民搞些副业，进行生产自救，把群众的情绪鼓舞起来。
    李鹏总理说，中国有11亿人口，农业问题在我国始终是一个大问题。以农业为基础的思想不能动摇，要坚定不移地抓好粮食生产。我国农作物的产量并没有到头，只要充分调动农民的积极性，进行科学种田，增产潜力还是很大的。今后，从中央政府到地方政府都要用更大的力量来抓农业，增加对农业的投入，支持农业的发展。今冬明春，要充分发动群众，集中人力物力大搞农田基本建设，进一步改善农业生产的条件。要在巩固家庭联产承包责任制的基础上，适当发展适度规模经营，建立农业服务体系和各种形式的农村集体经济。
    关于乡镇企业，李鹏说，乡镇企业还是要发展的，但要建立在农村资源的基础上，不要跟大企业争原料、争能源，以便更合理地使用国家有限的资源。
    李鹏总理视察了东北轻合金加工厂、哈尔滨飞机制造公司、桦林橡胶厂、牡丹江第二发电厂、辽阳石油化纤公司等大中型企业，同鞍山钢铁公司等30家大中型企业的厂长、经理及党委书记座谈，了解生产、经营管理与职工生活的情况，广泛征求他们对企业承包的意见。李鹏说，国家应为大中型企业创造一个比较好的外部环境，大中型企业也应加强管理，加强技术改造，进行内部结构调整，努力提高产品质量，降低消耗，特别是降低原材料消耗，为国家多做贡献。
    李鹏说，自从实行承包责任制以来，成绩是主要的，承包制对促进生产的发展，保证国家的财政收入，对企业的自我更新改造和职工生活的改善等，都起了积极的作用。现在承包责任制有的已经到期，有的即将到期，面临一个怎么办的问题。我们的方针应该是保持政策的稳定性，没有到期的不改变，已经到期的，在没有新的办法以前，可以继续延长。特别是在治理整顿时期，企业外部条件变化较大，困难较多，继续实行承包制有利于调动企业领导和职工的积极性和主动性，变压力为动力，千方百计地去克服困难，以保持生产稳定的发展。
    李鹏指出，承包制也存在着一些不完善的地方，主要表现在处理国家、企业、职工个人三者利益，长远与眼前利益的关系上，有些弊端并不是承包制必然会发生的，而是由它引发出来的，例如企业的短期行为、分配不公等。只要各级领导和企业领导指导思想端正，措施得当，存利除弊，就可使承包制发挥更大的作用。
    李鹏总理视察了边境城市满洲里和绥芬河，在谈到边境贸易时，李鹏说，我国实行开放的政策，面向世界各国，对苏联东欧的开放，也是我国开放政策的一个组成部分。中苏的经济特点不同，资源情况不同，经济上有一定的互补性和互换性，中苏经济技术合作具有广阔的前景。中苏两国关系正常化，为进一步发展中苏经济合作，发挥各自的优势创造了条件。中苏经济合作的发展是建立在平等互利的基础上的。
    所到之处李鹏总理最关心三个数字：一是农民平均收入，二是职工平均收入，三是物价上升指数。他说这三个数字直接关系到人民群众的生活。黑龙江实施控制物价“383工程”后，物价稳中有降，群众比较满意。李鹏说，这项工作要继续抓下去，前一段主要是抓菜园子、保菜篮子，重点搞好大路菜、当家菜。有了充足的当家菜，市场菜价就可以得到平抑。
    李鹏说，前几年总需求超过总供给，使整个经济发展不协调，在治理整顿期间，要真正有过几年紧日子的思想准备，提出切实可行的措施，充分发动群众，克服当前暂时的困难。
    李鹏指出，再像前几年那样高速度发展是不可能的。基本建设压缩后，为基建服务的加工业发展速度要下来，消费基金也会随之减少。这是一个痛苦的过程，也是我们进行结构调整，加强企业管理，加强技术改造，提高产品质量，从而提高企业经济效益的好机会。
    在视察期间，李鹏总理听取了四省区的汇报，就当前的工作做了多次讲话。
    9月19日，李鹏总理结束视察返回北京。随同李鹏总理视察的有农业部长何康、国家计委副主任叶青、国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心总干事马洪、对外经济贸易部副部长李岚清。
