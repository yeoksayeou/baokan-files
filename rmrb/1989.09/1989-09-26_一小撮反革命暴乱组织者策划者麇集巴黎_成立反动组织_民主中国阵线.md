A small group of counter-revolutionary riot organizers and planners gathered in Paris to form the reactionary organization "Democratic China Front."

New China News Agency Paris, September 24 — Under the tacit approval of the French government, Paris recently witnessed a farce of establishing the so-called "Democratic China Front."

This farce concluded on September 24, with the "Democratic China Front Constitution" being passed, aiming to overthrow the Chinese government from abroad. The organizers and planners of the Beijing counter-revolutionary riot, Yan Jiaqi and Wu'er Kaixi, were announced as the "Chairman" and "Vice Chairman" of this "Front," while Wan Runnan was named the "General Secretary."

Approximately 150 people participated in this farce in Paris, coming from North America, Western Europe, and Hong Kong and Taiwan. Besides the organizers and planners of the Beijing counter-revolutionary riot, Yan Jiaqi, Wu'er Kaixi, Wan Runnan, Chen Yizhi, and Su Xiaokang, there were also reactionary intellectuals like Liu Binyan who persist in bourgeois liberalization. These individuals repeatedly maliciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system during the "establishment meeting," advocating for the overthrow of the Chinese government and the establishment of a "bourgeois democratic system" in China. They also labeled the activities of Tibetan separatists abroad as "just causes" and repeatedly called for Western countries to impose economic sanctions on China. They openly demanded that the Kuomintang in Taiwan provide them with funding and even assistance and leadership in their anti-government activities. Representatives from the Kuomintang attended this "establishment meeting," and Kuomintang legislator Li Shengfeng declared in his speech that they would together "welcome the dawn."

It was announced that the headquarters of this reactionary organization would be set in the French capital, Paris. Since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot aimed at overthrowing the Chinese government in Beijing, the French government has consistently ignored international law and international norms, harboring and shielding fugitive Chinese anti-government elements, including those wanted by the Chinese government for criminal offenses, and allowing them to engage in anti-Chinese government activities on French soil.

    一小撮反革命暴乱组织者策划者麇集巴黎
    成立反动组织“民主中国阵线”
    新华社巴黎9月24日电　在法国政府的纵容下，最近3天巴黎上演了一场成立所谓“民主中国阵线”的闹剧。
    这场闹剧9月24日收场时通过的“民主中国阵线章程”，以从国外来颠覆中国政府为宗旨。这次北京反政府暴乱的组织者和策划者严家其、吾尔开希被宣布为这个“阵线”的“主席”和“副主席”，万润南为“总书记”。
    参与巴黎这场闹剧的约有150人，来自北美、西欧和港台等地区，其中除这次北京反革命暴乱的组织者、策划者严家其、吾尔开希、万润南、陈一谘、苏晓康等人外，还有坚持资产阶级自由化的反动文人刘宾雁等。这伙人在这次“成立会”上一再恶毒攻击中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度，鼓吹要推翻中国政府，在中国建立“资产阶级民主制度”。他们还把西藏分裂主义分子在国外进行的分裂祖国活动说成是“正义之举”，并一再要西方国家对中国实行经济制裁。他们公开要求台湾国民党向他们提供资助，甚至帮助和领导他们的反政府活动。台湾国民党派人参加了这次“成立会”，国民党籍的“立法委员”李胜峰在会上的讲话中声言要和这伙人一起“迎接光明”。
    据宣布，这个反动组织的总部将设在法国首都巴黎。自从北京平息旨在推翻中国政府的反革命暴乱以来，法国政府一直无视国际法和国际关系准则，收容、包庇潜逃的中国反政府分子包括遭到中国政府通缉的刑事犯罪分子，并纵容他们在法国领土上从事反对中国政府的活动。
