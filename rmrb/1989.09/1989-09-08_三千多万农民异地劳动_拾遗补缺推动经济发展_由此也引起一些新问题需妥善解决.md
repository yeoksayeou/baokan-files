Over 30 million farmers have left their hometowns or moved to other regions to work, engage in commerce, lease farmland, or work in the service industry since the mid-1980s. Among them, more than 8 million have crossed provincial borders. They not only supplement the labor force in some regions but also bring new vitality and dynamism to the economic development of some backward border areas.

During a three-month investigation into the nationwide flow of migrant workers, reporters found that today's migrant workers are no longer the forced migrants of the past, such as those who ventured to the Northeast or the Northwest. Instead, they are driven by a pursuit of modern civilization, seeking higher economic returns in urban and rural areas away from home. The economically developed regions along the southeastern coast, particularly the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the newly emerging special economic zones, as well as the developing regions like Hainan Island, the Ili Valley, and the Sanjiang Plain, are their primary destinations. The sources of these migrant workers are mainly from more than ten provinces, including Sichuan, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi.

These migrant workers are different from both local farmers and urban state employees. In cities, they undertake most of the dirty, hard, and dangerous jobs, as well as those involving toxic and harmful substances. During their work, their technical skills continuously improve, enabling them to handle tasks with higher technical requirements. For example, a significant portion of the dock workers and textile workers in Shanghai are migrant workers. In the "three-in-one" enterprises in the Pearl River Delta, such as Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Dongguan, tens of thousands of "working youth" and "working girls" are the main force behind export earnings.

Many migrant workers also fill the labor gaps left by the shift of rural labor to secondary and tertiary industries in developed regions. They lease abandoned farmland to grow crops and vegetables, and utilize idle water surfaces to raise fish and ducks. In the rice fields of Jiangnan, the sugarcane fields of Guangdong, and the rubber plantations of Hainan Island, one can see the sweat of migrant workers everywhere. In vast urban and rural areas, as well as border mountain regions, most of the small repair jobs, such as shoe mending, umbrella repair, cotton carding, and furniture making, are also undertaken by migrant workers. Some migrant workers also transport vegetables and fruits, smoothing the supply chain and facilitating daily life.

Regardless of whether they are from the highlands of the Northwest or the mountains of Jinggangshan, migrant workers gain a lot of information, learn about commodity economy and technology, and understand competition during their work away from home. Upon returning to their hometowns, they become leaders in poverty alleviation and prosperity.

The flow of migrant workers also brings new impacts and challenges to transportation, urban and border life, social order, family planning, and other aspects, creating some new problems that need to be carefully studied, correctly guided, and properly resolved to avoid the negatives and emphasize the positives.

    三千多万农民异地劳动
    拾遗补缺推动经济发展
    由此也引起一些新问题需妥善解决
    新华社北京9月8日电  （记者葛象贤、屈维英）据调查，80年代中期以来，大约有3000多万农民离土或到异地农村务工、经商、承包经营土地或从事服务业。其中跨出省界的达800多万。他们不但补充了一些地区城乡劳动力的短缺，而且给一些边疆落后地区的经济发展带来新的活力和生机。
    记者在对全国的民工流动情况进行3个多月的大跨度追踪采访中看到，今日的农民工已非昔日被迫闯关东、走西口的流浪者，而是怀着对现代文明的追求，到异地城镇和乡村，以自己的汗水和智慧获取比在家乡高的经济收入。经济发达的东南沿海尤其是珠江三角洲、长江三角洲和新兴的经济特区，以及正待开发的海南岛、伊犁河谷、三江平原等地是他们流动的主要地区。而民工流的源头则是四川、河南、湖南、湖北、山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西等十多个省份。
    这些农民工，既不同于在家务农的农民，也不同于城市国家职工。在城市，他们不但承担了绝大部分脏活、苦活、累活以及有毒、有害、有危险的活种，而且在务工过程中，自己的技术素质不断提高，已能承担一些技术要求高的工程、项目、工种。如上海港的码头装卸工、上海纺织行业第一线的挡车女工，就有相当一部分是农民工。在珠江三角洲的深圳、珠海、东莞等地的几千家“三来一补”企业中，数十万“打工仔”、“打工妹”已是当地出口创汇的有生力量。
    许多农民工还填补了发达地区农村劳动力向二三产业转移之后在农业上留下的空缺。他们承包当地农民弃耕之地种粮种菜，利用闲置水面养鱼养鸭。在江南的稻田，在南粤的蔗园，在海南岛的胶林，到处都滴着民工勤苦劳作的汗水。在广大城乡和边疆山区，钉鞋、修伞、弹棉花、打家具等绝大多数修修补补的零活也都由民工承担起来。还有一部分民工则贩菜运果，疏通了产销渠道，方便了群众生活。
    农民工外出，不管是西北高原的“尕娃”，还是井冈山的
  “妹子”，在外出做工中他们吸收了许多信息，学到了商品经济知识和技术，懂得了竞争，回到家乡后成为脱贫致富的带头人。
    农民工的交流，也给交通运输、城市和边疆生活、社会治安、计划生育等带来新的冲击，产生了一些新的问题，需要认真研究，正确引导，妥善解决，避其短而扬其长。
