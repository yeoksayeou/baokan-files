    Forty Years of Change in Home Appliances

    In recent years, modern home appliances such as color televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, tape recorders, video recorders, electric fans, and electric cookers have successively emerged and entered households, bringing great joy to people.

    Former luxury items have become "display items." From the early days of the founding of the People's Republic to the late 1960s, industries producing bicycles, watches, sewing machines, and radios developed from nothing to something, and people took pride in being able to ride a bicycle, wear a watch, use a sewing machine, and listen to a "radio box." These "old four items" were seen as "jewels in the palm" and symbols of family wealth. With the introduction of new home appliances like televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, tape recorders, electric fans, and video recorders into households, the "old four items" have become ordinary consumer goods.

    Modern home appliances are constantly being updated. By 1988, the average household expenditure on home appliances was 609.60 yuan, an increase of 4.7 times compared to 1978. Home appliances can now be roughly categorized into several types:

    Entertainment-type home appliances. Technological advancements and production developments have accelerated product updates and replacements, with more ordinary tape recorders, computer-equipped stereo tape recorders, and floor-standing high-end audio systems entering households. The demand for black-and-white televisions has gradually stabilized and slowed down, while color televisions have entered households in large numbers, bringing new colors to residents' spiritual horizons and enriching their cultural lives. Additionally, the emergence of electronic game consoles, electronic keyboards, and electronic children's toys has played a positive role in developing children's intelligence. According to a survey, in 1988 alone, the average expenditure per child in our urban areas on electronic toys and entertainment items was 89 yuan.

    Comfort-type home appliances. The number of refrigerators in households has been increasing year by year. Our city is located in the northern border region, with a long cold period, but there are 18.5 refrigerators per 100 households. With the improvement of residents' living conditions, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, and shower heads have also become useful.

    Practical-type home appliances. Washing machines and electric cookers are practical, convenient, clean, and efficient, making them popular among residents. According to a survey, by August 1989, the average number of washing machines per 100 households was 80, and electric cookers were 95.5. Washing machines and electric cookers have become good helpers for residents, reducing the average time spent on washing clothes and cooking by 35 minutes and 24 minutes per person per day, respectively, compared to 1983.

    四十年变迁话家电
    近年来现代家用电器，如彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、收录机、录相机、电风扇、电炊具等相继问世，并涌入居民家庭，给人们带来了无比欢欣。
    往昔的高档耐用品变成了“陈列品”。建国初期到60年代末，自行车、手表、缝纫机、收音机等产业，从无到有，不断发展，人们为能骑上自行车、带上手表、蹬上缝纫机、听上“电匣子”，而引以自豪。人们把这“老四件”视为“掌上明珠”和家庭“富有”的象征。随着电视机、电冰箱、洗衣机、收录机、电风扇、录相机等新型家用电器相继进入居民家庭，“老四件”做为过去的家庭高档耐用品，已成了一般消费品。
    现代家用电器层出不穷。截至1988年，居民平均每户家用电器支出为609.60元，比1978年增长4.7倍。现在的家用电器约分为几种类型：
    娱乐型家电。科技的进步，生产的发展，促进了产品的更新换代，更多地涌入居民家庭的则是普通式收录机、带电脑的立体声收录机、以及落地式高级音响。黑白电视机的需求已逐步稳中呈缓，彩色电视机纷纷闯入了居民家庭，并为开阔居民的精神视野和丰富文化生活带来了新的色彩。此外，电子游戏机、电子琴、电子儿童玩具的相继问世，这对开发儿童的智力，起到了积极的作用。据调查，仅1988年，我市区平均每名儿童购买电子玩具及娱乐品等支出就达89元。
    享受型家电。居民家庭的电冰箱的拥有量逐年上升。我市地处塞北边陲，寒冷期较长，但每百户居民拥有电冰箱18.5台，而随着居民生活条件的改善，吸尘器、空气调节器和淋浴器都派上了用场。
    实效型家电。洗衣机、电炊具等家用电器以其实用、方便、清洁、高效，倍受居民的青睐。据调查，截至到1989年8月，平均每百户居民洗衣机拥有量为80台，电炊具为95.5台；洗衣机和电炊具等家电成了居民的好帮手，并使平均每人每天洗衣和做饭时间，分别比1983年减少了35分钟和24分钟。
