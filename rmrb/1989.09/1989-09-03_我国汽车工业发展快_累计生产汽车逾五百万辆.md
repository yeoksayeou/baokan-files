China's automobile industry has rapidly developed, with cumulative production of various types of automobiles exceeding 5 million vehicles in nearly 40 years since the founding of New China. Today, more than 80% of the cars on the roads of China, once dubbed the "World Automobile Expo," are domestically produced. An independent and complete automobile industry system is taking shape in China.

In recent years, the state has given priority to the development of the automobile industry as a pillar of the national economy, providing support and assistance. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, investments in the automobile industry reached 1 billion yuan, equivalent to the total investment from 1953 to 1985, driving the industry to achieve an average annual production increase of 25% over the past five years.

Over the past decade, China's automobile industry has successfully introduced and digested advanced automobile and component production technologies and testing methods from Japan, the United States, Italy, West Germany, France, Austria, and other countries. The domestic production plan is being steadily implemented, narrowing the technological gap between China and the global automobile manufacturing industry by 20 to 30 years. Chinese automobile products have begun to enter the international market.

    我国汽车工业发展快
    累计生产汽车逾五百万辆
    据新华社北京9月2日电  （记者李安定）今天，国家统计部门的计算机终端显示：新中国近40年来累计生产各类汽车已突破500万辆的大关，昔日被称为“万国汽车博览会”的中国大地上，往来飞驰的汽车中80％以上是国产车。一个独立完整的汽车工业体系正在中国形成。
    近年来，国家把汽车工业列为国民经济的支柱产业给予重视和扶持，“七五”期间，用于汽车工业的投资达100亿元，相当于1953年至1985年投资的总和，促使汽车工业在近5年来获得每年产量平均递增25％的长足进展。
    近10年，我国汽车工业成功地引进和消化、吸收了日本、美国、意大利、联邦德国、法国、奥地利等国先进的汽车和零部件生产技术和测试手段，国产化计划正在扎扎实实地实施，使我国和世界汽车制造业的技术差距缩短了20至30年，中国的汽车产品已开始进入国际市场。
