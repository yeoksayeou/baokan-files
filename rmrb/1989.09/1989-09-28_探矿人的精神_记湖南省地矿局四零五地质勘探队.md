In the Wuling Mountain area of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the mountains and rivers bear the tireless footsteps and sweat of a geological exploration team, which is the 405 team of the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources.

In its 31 years of existence, the 405 team has achieved extraordinary results in the Wuling Mountain area: discovering 56 types of minerals, with the potential value of identified mineral resources reaching over 2 billion yuan. In 1980, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources issued a commendation order, conferring the honorable title of "Geological Team Making Major Contributions to Mineral Exploration" upon the team. In 1985, during the second national geological and mineral resources system award ceremony, the team was awarded the first prize. In 1988, the State Council conferred the honorable title of "Advanced Unit for National Unity" upon the team.

The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture covers an area of over 20,000 square kilometers, with towering mountains, steep cliffs, vast lands, and sparse population. Exploring for minerals in the Wuling Mountain area requires crossing mountains and rivers, climbing cliffs, and scaling steep slopes, often going for days without seeing any signs of human habitation. Geological team members frequently eat dry rations, drink cold water, sleep on piles of rice straw or corn husks, and sometimes even camp out on mountain tops or cliff ledges. Drilling sites are often located tens or even hundreds of kilometers away from roads in the deep mountains, and heavy equipment has to be carried by shoulder or hand to reach the top. It is under these harsh conditions that the geological workers of the 405 team have discovered one mineral after another and identified one mineral deposit after another.

Manganese is a mineral in urgent demand by the state. In February 1966, Communist Party member and geologist Wu Jiguì heard that colleagues in a neighboring province had found manganese in the Sinian System in Guizhou, and he also wanted to find manganese in the Sinian System in Xiangxi. On March 1 of that year, before the fieldwork period began, he led seven geological workers to brave the early spring cold and search for manganese in Fenghuang County and Huayuan County, where the Sinian System is located. They carried their prospecting tools and luggage, crossing mountains and rivers, and fording streams. They set out before dawn each day and rested wherever they ended up at dusk. Sometimes, if they couldn't find a village, they would sleep in straw piles by the roadside or in sheds on the mountainside where farmers stored corn husks and corn stalks. Once, in Minle Town, Xingshui Village, Huayuan County, Wu Jiguì accidentally fell from a 40-meter-high cliff. Fortunately, a tree broke his fall, and he landed on a slope, unconscious. When he came to, he endured the pain and hobbled forward with a tree branch as a crutch. Eventually, they discovered manganese ore in the Minle Town area. The team decided to immediately conduct a survey. Trucks could only transport the survey equipment to Songtao Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province. From Songtao to Minle Town, there are still over 60 kilometers of rugged mountain roads with no vehicles. Wu Jiguì and others relied on their iron shoulders and iron feet, crossing mountains and rivers, to carry the survey equipment piece by piece into the mountains. Soon, they identified a manganese reserve of over 29 million tons in the Minle Town area, one of the few large manganese mines in China. Shortly after, the Minle manganese mine was listed as a key development project by the central government and was mined and utilized.

The geological workers of the 405 team not only work tenaciously under harsh conditions but also insist on frugality in geological work, sparing no effort to save national expenses. According to incomplete statistics, since 1980, they have saved the country 2.19 million yuan.

Geological teams have many auxiliary and physically demanding tasks, such as equipment relocation, which, according to regulations, can be outsourced to local labor. The geological workers of the 405 team, in order to save expenses, actively took on a large amount of physically demanding work. In August 1987, the mercury core warehouse in Fenghuang needed to be relocated, and hiring local labor would cost over 6,000 yuan in transportation fees. Team leader Zhang Panhua and Party Secretary Liu Jixiang led over 50 team members and office staff to brave the scorching summer heat, working tirelessly for three days to complete the relocation of over 7,000 boxes of core samples.

A significant portion of the geological workers in the 405 team come from relatively developed provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, many of whom come from large cities. They have dedicated their youth, talent, and strength to the geological cause, fighting in the mountains year after year. When they arrived, they were in the prime of their lives, but after long periods of field geological work, they are now mostly gray-haired, but they still cherish their field geological work. Chief Engineer and Communist Party member Zhuang Rugui of the 4th Brigade was born in Qingdao and graduated from Nanjing Geological School in 1956. He came to the 405 team in 1965 and has since been engaged in field geological exploration, discovering multiple mineral deposits such as the lead-zinc mine in Paiwu Songmu Village, the nickel-vanadium mine in Dayong, and the coal mine in Sangzhi. Lead and zinc are metals in short supply in both domestic and international markets. The lead-zinc ore deposit in Huayuan County covers an area of over 100 square kilometers. Many domestic geological workers and Soviet experts have worked in this area, evaluating it as having "only stars, no moon." In 1979, Zhuang Rugui, Peng Guozhong, and Shu Jianwen came here to survey and study. After two years of field observation and indoor research, they believed that there might be a rich ore body in the northern area. After eight or nine years of hard work, Zhuang Rugui and others finally identified the Limai mining area as a large lead-zinc rich ore deposit.

The geological workers of the 405 team have endured countless hardships to discover mineral deposits. When they see that the mining industry in ethnic minority areas has developed, they are very happy. As some engineers have said, "I have done good for the country and the people, and I have not lived in vain."

    探矿人的精神
    ——记湖南省地矿局四零五地质勘探队
    本报记者　吴兴华
    在武陵山区的湘西土家族苗族自治州，山山水水间留下了一支地质勘探队辛勤的足迹和汗水，那就是湖南省地矿局405队。
    建队31年来，405队在武陵山区建立了非凡的业绩：发现矿产56种，探明矿产资源的潜在价值达200多亿元。1980年，地矿部颁发嘉奖令，授予该队
  “为地质找矿做出重大贡献地质队”的光荣称号。1985年，在全国地矿系统第二次评功授奖大会上，该队又荣获一等奖。1988年，国务院授予该队“民族团结先进单位”的光荣称号。
    湘西土家族苗族自治州，面积2万多平方公里，境内层峦叠嶂，山雄峰险，地广人稀。在武陵山区找矿，要翻山越岭，攀悬崖，爬峭壁，时常数天见不到人烟。地质队员经常吃干粮，喝凉水，睡稻草堆、包谷壳，有时就露宿山头、崖檐。钻探地往往在离公路数十、上百公里的大山上，笨重的设备要靠肩扛人抬才能搬上山。405队的地质工作者就是在这样艰苦的条件下找到了一个又一个矿种，探明了一处又一处矿藏。
    锰矿是国家急需的矿种。1966年2月，共产党员、地质工程师吴积贵听到邻省的同行在贵州震旦系地层中找到锰矿的信息，也想在湘西的震旦系地层找到锰矿。这年3月1日，野外工作期未到，他便带领7名地质工作者冒着初春的严寒，到有震旦系地层的凤凰县、花垣县找锰矿。他们挑着寻矿工具和行李，翻山越岭，涉河过溪。每天天不亮出发，天黑时，走到哪里歇到哪里。有时，找不到村庄，就睡在路旁的稻草堆里，睡在山上农民存放包谷壳、包谷秆等物的茅棚里。一次，在花垣县民乐镇响水村，吴积贵不慎从40多米高的悬崖上摔了下去，幸亏中间有棵树拦了一下，落到坡坎上，昏迷过去。一醒过来，他忍着疼痛，拄着树枝朝前走。后来终于在民乐镇境内发现了锰矿石。队部决定立即勘探。汽车运送勘探设备只能运到贵州省松桃苗族自治县城，从松桃到民乐镇还有60多公里，不通汽车，全是崎岖山路。吴积贵等人靠着两只铁肩膀、一双铁脚，翻山越岭，将勘探机具一件一件运进山。很快，他们就探明民乐镇一带的锰矿储量为2900多万吨，是我国少有的大型锰矿。不久，民乐锰矿被中央列为重点开发项目，被开采、利用。
    405队的地质工作者们不仅在艰苦的条件下顽强地工作，还坚持勤俭办地质事业，千方百计为国家节约开支。据不完全统计，1980年来，他们为国家节约资金219万元。
    地质队有许多辅助性强体力工作，如设备搬迁等，按规定，可雇请民工承担。405队的地质工作者为了节约开支，把大量的强体力工作主动承担起来。1987年8月，凤凰汞岩芯仓库需搬迁，请民工要花6000多元搬运费。队长张攀华、党委书记刘吉祥带领50多名队部科室人员，冒着盛夏酷署，连续苦战3天，完成了7000多箱岩芯的搬迁工作。
    405队的相当一部分地质工作者来自上海、浙江、广东等较发达的省、市，其中不少来自大城市，长年累月战斗在大山沟，把自己的青春、才华和力量献给了地质事业。他们来的时候风华正茂，经过长时期的野外地质生活，如今大都两鬓成霜，但仍然对野外地质工作恋恋不舍。4分队主任工程师、共产党员庄汝礼，生长在青岛市，1956年毕业于南京地质学校，1965年来到405队后，一直从事野外地质勘探工作，先后找到排吾杉木村铅锌矿、大庸镍木钒矿、桑植煤矿等多处矿藏。铅、锌，是国内、国际市场紧缺的金属。花垣县境内的铅锌矿床，面积达100多平方公里，不少国内的地质工作者和苏联专家都先后到该区工作过，评价是：“只有星星，没有月亮”。1979年，庄汝礼和彭国忠、舒见闻来到这里勘察、研究。经过2年的野外观察和室内研究，他们认为北部区可能存在富矿体。经过八九年的奋战，庄汝礼等人终于探明李梅矿区是一个大型铅锌富矿床。
      405队的地质工作者历尽千辛万苦找到矿藏，当他们看到少数民族地区的矿业发展起来了，很高兴。正如有的工程师讲的：“我为国家、人民造了福，没有白活。”
