The roads have woven into a network, cars darting like shuttles; in the past decade, especially, road construction has been particularly prolific..." Located in the northwestern part of the motherland, Ningxia was once economically backward and had poor transportation. Now, all cities and counties in the region have basically paved roads, and every township and town has access to highways.

"The key to prosperity is to build roads first." This is a folk song that has been circulating in Ningxia. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the central government, local authorities, and the transportation department have jointly invested over 300 million yuan to build 1,436 kilometers of paved roads and 522 bridges. Before 1985, there was only one Yasheng Yellow River Highway Bridge. Now, the Zhongning and Shizuishan Yellow River Highway Bridges have been completed and opened to traffic, and construction has begun on the fourth Qingtongxia Yellow River Highway Bridge. In the mountainous southern region of Ningxia, over the past three years, using grain, cotton, and cloth to build and reconstruct 96 roads totaling 1,958 kilometers through labor exchange, the total length of roads built since liberation until 1985 has been surpassed. This has made it possible for every township to have access to highways, and 86% of townships have bus services. In the past, the 30-kilometer road from Shuanghe Township in Haiyuan County to the county seat had countless gullies, and a local folk song went, "Seventy-two gullies, each one muddy. When the mud dries, it's a mountain. When the road is flat, it's the city." In the past two years, a new road has been built here, and farmers no longer have to wade through water; they can reach the city in just an hour or two.

The rapid development of roads has significantly promoted the activation of the transportation market. By the end of 1988, the region had over 25,000 civilian vehicles. State-owned, collective, and individual transportation capacities complement each other, handling 85% of the region's passenger volume and 67% of the cargo volume.

    公路成网　客货畅通
    “公路织成网哟，汽车如穿梭；最近10年哟，修路尤其多……”位于祖国西北的宁夏，过去经济落后，交通闭塞。如今，全区所有市县基本上通沥青路，乡乡镇镇通公路。
    “要想富，先修路。”这是流传在宁夏的一句民谣。党的十一届三中全会以来，中央、地方和交通部门共投资3亿多元，新建沥青路1436公里，新建桥梁522座。1985年前，只有一座叶盛黄河公路大桥。如今，中宁、石嘴山两座黄河公路大桥已建成通车，第四座青铜峡黄河公路大桥已开工兴建。山大沟深的宁夏南部山区，近3年利用粮棉布以工代赈修建和改建公路96条，全长1958公里，为解放以来至1985年修路的总和，使乡乡通公路，86％的乡镇通了班车。过去，海原县双河乡通往县城的30公里路上，沟湾多得数不清，当地流传着这样一首歌谣：“72道湾，湾湾脚不干。脚干了，上山了。路平了，进城了。”近两年这里建成了新公路，农民不用趟水，个把钟头即可进城。
    公路的大发展，有力促进运输市场日趋活跃。到1988年底，全区民用汽车已达25000多辆，国营、集体、个体运力互为补充，承担了全区客运量85％、货运量67％的运输任务。
