Since the reform and opening up, by the first half of this year, business and trade representatives from more than 20 countries and regions have directly invested $447 million in Guangdong to establish wholly foreign-owned enterprises or to cooperate with local partners to set up joint ventures. The products produced by these "three-R" enterprises have a total export value of $309.5 million.

Establishing "three-R" enterprises is one of the main ways Guangdong attracts international funds to accelerate economic development. Currently, the province has approved the establishment of 10,056 "three-R" enterprises, including 364 wholly foreign-owned enterprises. These "three-R" enterprises have shifted from focusing mainly on light industry to producing basic industries, raw materials, components, and parts, and have also driven improvements in the investment environment for energy, transportation, and communications. Now, more than 5,000 of these "three-R" enterprises have started production (operations). The provincial government strengthens macro-level guidance for "three-R" enterprises, encouraging foreign investors to develop export-oriented production. The amount of foreign investment in productive projects has significantly increased. Starting from 1984, the products of these enterprises have been included in the province's foreign trade export plan. Currently, the export value of "three-R" enterprise products accounts for 20.4% of the province's total trade export value, up from 3.4% in 1984.

Due to foreign investors directly investing in "three-R" enterprises, Guangdong has introduced a batch of advanced equipment and technology, as well as a relatively scientific management system. According to a survey conducted last year on 1,278 "three-R" enterprises in Guangdong that have started production, 914 of them were profitable, with the profitability rate increasing from 63.7% the previous year to 71.5%.

　　吸收国际资金　加速经济发展
　　“三资”企业异军突起
    改革开放以来，到今年上半年止，来自20多个国家和地区的工商贸易界人士，到广东直接投资44.7亿美元，举办独资企业或与粤方合作、合资办企业。这些“三资”企业所生产的产品，出口总额达30.95亿美元。
    建立“三资”企业，是广东吸收国际资金，加速经济发展的主要方式之一。目前全省已批准建立的“三资”企业有10056家，其中独资企业364家。这些“三资”企业由以轻工业为主，开始向基础工业、原材料、元器件、零部件的生产转变，并且推动了能源、交通、通讯等投资环境的改善。现在，全省已投产（营业）的“三资”企业逾5000家。省政府加强对“三资”企业的宏观指导，鼓励外商投资发展出口商品生产，外商投向生产性项目的资金大幅度上升。从1984年开始，这些企业的产品出口，已列入全省外贸出口计划。现在“三资”企业产品出口额，在全省贸易出口总值中已从1984年的占3.4％，提高到今年上半年的占20.4％。
    由于外商前来直接投资办“三资”企业，这就给广东引进了一批先进设备和技术，同时带来了一套比较科学的管理经验。据有关方面去年对广东投产的1278家“三资”企业的调查统计，盈利企业达914家，盈利面已由上一年的63.7％上升为71.5％。
