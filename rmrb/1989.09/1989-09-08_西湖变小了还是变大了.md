The phrase "Heaven and Earth's thirty-six West Lakes, the best is Hangzhou" has been used by ancient scholars and modern writers to describe the beauty of West Lake. They have woven the finest words into garlands and placed them on the head of this "West Lake Maiden."

However, in recent years, the topic of West Lake has often revolved around the word "change": has West Lake become smaller or larger?

Those who say West Lake has become "smaller" point to the crowds of tourists, shoulder to shoulder, and the bustling activity. In 1988, nearly 30 million tourists visited, double the number in 1979, yet the lake's area remains at 5.6 square kilometers.

The tranquil scene of a few boats gently floating on the lake, accompanied by the soft voices of boatwomen, has been disrupted. Sleek, modern tour boats, along with various types of rowboats, electric boats, and pedal boats, crisscross the lake, making it seem smaller.

Yet, West Lake has indeed become larger.

Visitors will recall that the high walls and old residences that once divided West Lake have largely disappeared, making the lake's view more expansive. The parks around the lake, once narrow and cramped, have now truly become beautiful gardens and green spaces. The ten-kilometer shoreline, once fragmented, now has six kilometers connected as one. The beautifully designed lakeside amusement park, the colorful youth palace square, and the elegant Wanghu Tower... all these have suddenly "appeared" in the past few years.

The water in West Lake has become clearer. Since the completion of the West Lake water diversion project in September 1986, clean water has been directly diverted from the Qiantang River to West Lake, with 300,000 tons of water diverted daily. This has improved the lake's water quality, increasing its transparency from 40 centimeters in the late 1970s to 55 centimeters today.

A series of unique tourist attractions and new cultural landscapes have emerged, effectively dispersing the tourist flow. In addition to the original ten scenic spots like "Broken Bridge in Snow" and "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," the new "Ten Scenic Spots of West Lake" such as "Cloud Dwelling Bamboo Path" and "Dragon Well Tea Tasting" have also made their debut. "Curved Courtyard Lotus" and the botanical garden's "Forest Bath" provide a quiet refuge for those weary of city noise; the "Willow Waves Listening to Orioles" night garden and the lakeside amusement park's music tea house have changed the impression of West Lake being "lonely at night." Memorial halls dedicated to ancient national heroes and scholars, such as the Wushan Lard Statue Memorial Hall, Su Dongpo Memorial Hall, Zhang Taiyan Memorial Hall, and the Hangzhou Stele Forest, also provide venues for patriotic education.

At this point, the debate over whether West Lake has become smaller or larger seems to have lost its significance. West Lake has become even more charming and enchanting, and its tourism offerings have become richer. This is its true essence.

### 西湖变小了还是变大了

    西湖变小了还是变大了
    “天下西湖三十六，就中最好是杭州。”古代文人墨客、现代作家名流，将人间最美好的词句，编识成一束束花环，插到这位“西子姑娘”的发髻上。
    然而近几年来，关于西湖的话题常常集中在一个“变”字上：西湖是变小了，还是变大了？
    说西湖“小”了——
    是因为游人如织，摩肩接踵。一九八八年游客近三千万人次，比一九七九年增二倍，而西湖面积还是五点六平方公里；
    是因为过去那种在波平如镜的湖面上荡漾几叶扁舟，伴着几位船家姑娘轻轻絮语导游的静境被打破了；通体透亮的新颖游艇，以及各式各类的手摇船、电瓶船、脚踏船，穿梭般此来彼往，“百舸争流”，西湖似乎被挤小了。
    然而，西湖又确确实实是变大了。
    游人们记得，前几年那些阻隔和分割西湖的高墙大院，七高八低的破旧民居，如今已难觅踪迹，从而使西湖游客的视野更加开阔。原先环湖的公园狭小局促，如今已名副其实地变成景致优美的花园绿地；多年来一直支离破碎的十公里湖岸现在已有六公里连成一片。建筑优美别致的湖畔乐园，四季五彩缤纷的少年宫广场公园，古朴典雅的望湖楼……都是近三四年内突然 “冒”出来的。
    西湖水变清了。自一九八六年九月西湖引水工程完工后，直接从钱塘江引清流到西湖，日引水三十万吨，改善了西湖水体，使西湖透明度从七十年代末的四十厘米提高到今天的五十五厘米。
    一批西湖的特色旅游项目和新的人文景观应运而生，起到了使旅客分流的作用。除原有的“断桥残雪”、“平湖秋月”等十景外，“云栖竹径”、“龙井问茶”等“西湖新十景”也一展风采。“曲院风荷”、植物园的“森林浴”，使深受城市喧嚣之苦的人们获得一块清静之地；
  “柳浪闻莺”夜花园、湖畔乐园音乐茶座，改变了往昔西湖“夜寂寞”的印象；吴山腊像纪念馆、苏东坡纪念馆、章太炎纪念馆、杭州碑林等一批歌颂古代民族英雄和学者的人文景观，也为人们提供了进行爱国主义教育的场所。
    至此，争论西湖是变小了，还是变大了，似乎已无多大意思了。西湖变得更加妩媚动人，西湖旅游内容更加丰富，这才是她的真正内涵。　（应舍法）
