In the process of implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, the Liaoning Provincial Committee often hears doubts from enterprises: Does proposing that the party organization is the "political core" of the enterprise affect the "central position" of the factory director? Will production and operations and ideological and political work become "two separate entities"? Will the pursuit of corruption in production and operations affect the enthusiasm of enterprise management?

Facing these issues, the provincial committee believes: Liaoning is an industrial base in China. Whether the enterprises can be stabilized is a matter of great importance, and resolving their doubts is key to stabilizing the enterprises. Therefore, Provincial Committee Secretary Quan Shuren led the "leading group" to various parts of the province to conduct investigations and research, addressing doubts one by one in each enterprise, stabilizing the thoughts of factory directors, party committee secretaries, and workers, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and making the enterprises more vibrant.

Quan Shuren conducted investigations and research in cities such as Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Liaoyang, and Dalian, listening to the opinions of more than 100 factory directors, party committee secretaries, and other cadres from more than 30 enterprises, and also visited a number of workers. He addressed different issues in each unit with solid work. In Shenyang, he had a discussion with the heads of more than ten enterprises, including the Sino-Czech Friendship Factory, Cable Factory, Refrigerator Factory, and Jinbei Automobile Company. He found that some people thought that now that the party organization is proposed as the "political core" of the enterprise, the "central position" of the factory director would be lost, and that the factory director responsibility system is like a rabbit's tail, which cannot last long. Quan Shuren said, the party organization being the "political core" means that the party organization should supervise and ensure that the enterprise implements and executes the party's line, principles, and policies, thereby maintaining the socialist direction of the enterprise; while the factory director responsibility system means that the factory director is fully responsible for the production and operation activities of the enterprise, ensuring a smooth command system. The two have different responsibilities but are also interconnected. It is both a deepening and improvement of the enterprise leadership system reform to insist that the party organization is the "political core" while maintaining the "central position" of the factory director. It is wrong to emphasize the factory director responsibility system and speak ill of the secretary in the past, and it is also wrong to emphasize the core role of the party organization and belittle the factory director and manager now.

At the symposium with some enterprise leaders in Benxi, Anshan, Yingkou, and Fuxin, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee Wang Juluo and Member of the Standing Committee and Propaganda Department Director Wang Chongru explained the issue of whether production and operations and ideological and political work would become "two separate entities" again. They said: The past "two separate entities" phenomenon was caused by the policy of "taking class struggle as the key link" and "politics can impact other aspects." Now the party's work focus has shifted to economic construction, and the party's basic line is "one center, two basic points." Whether it is the party committee secretary or the factory director, they are all for this goal, just with different divisions of labor. The factory director organizes production and operations and cannot do without people's work, and the party committee's ideological work must also penetrate into the production and operations process to be carried out. They are all to revolve around the central task of developing productive forces, so how can there be "two separate entities"? Due to the wrong interference of Zhao Ziyang, many places weakened ideological and political work. The urgent task now is for factory directors, managers, and secretaries to consider the interests of the party and the state, recognize the importance and urgency of strengthening ideological and political work, and not to argue endlessly over who has more power and who has less power on some issues.

Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee and Governor Li Changchun and other leaders discovered during their investigations and research in Jinzhou, Yingkou, and Dalian that some factory directors and managers saw that a few factory directors were dealt with in the fight against corruption and thought it was a signal to target them, and their morale was low. Therefore, the provincial committee leaders analyzed cases and used facts to explain to factory directors and managers that corrupt elements are in the list of crackdowns, but the basic assessment of this team should not be changed because of a few degenerates. It is important to distinguish between normal business activities and business dealings (including mistakes in this aspect of work) and corrupt behavior in enterprises. We should seriously summarize experience, persist in what is correct, and correct what is wrong. We should be determined to make reforms and opening up even better.

    辽宁省领导深入基层引导企业负责人
    全面理解四中全会精神
    稳定企业改革大政方针
    本报沈阳9月23日电　记者段心强报道：在贯彻四中全会精神中，辽宁省委不时听到来自企业的疑虑：提出党组织是企业的“政治核心”，是不是会影响厂长的“中心地位”？生产经营和思想政治工作会不会出现“两张皮”？反腐败中对生产经营中问题的追查，会不会影响企业经营的积极性？
    面对这些问题，省委认为：辽宁是我国的工业基地，能不能稳定住企业事关大局，而解除他们的疑虑又是稳定企业的关键。因此，省委书记全树仁带领“一班人”分头到全省各地调查研究，一个企业一个企业地解除疑虑，稳定了厂长、党委书记和职工的思想，调动了各方面的积极性，使企业更加充满活力。
    全树仁到沈阳、抚顺、本溪、辽阳、大连等市调查研究，听取了30多个企业100多名厂长、党委书记和其他干部的意见，还走访一批工人，针对各单位不同的问题作扎扎实实的工作。在沈阳，他和中捷友谊厂、电缆厂、电冰箱厂和金杯汽车公司等十几个企业的负责人座谈，发现一些人认为现在提出党组织是企业的“政治核心”，厂长的“中心地位”就保不住，厂长负责制也是兔子的尾巴，长不了。全树仁说，党组织是“政治核心”，是指党组织要监督、保证企业贯彻、执行党的路线、方针、政策，从而坚持企业的社会主义方向；而厂长负责制是指厂长对企业的生产经营活动全面负责，保证指挥系统畅通。两者分工负责，又互相联系。既坚持党组织是“政治核心”，又维护厂长的“中心地位”，是对企业领导体制改革的进一步深化和完善。过去强调厂长负责制就把书记说得“一团糟”不对，现在强调党组织的核心作用就贬低厂长、经理也不对。
    在本溪、鞍山、营口、阜新等市部分企业负责人座谈会上，省委副书记王巨禄，常委、宣传部长王充闾，就生产经营与思想政治工作会不会再出现“两张皮”的问题进行了阐述。他们说：过去出现“两张皮”是因为当时“以阶级斗争为纲”、“政治可以冲击其他”的方针造成的。现在全党的工作重点已转移到经济建设上来，党的基本路线是“一个中心，两个基本点”，党委书记也好，厂长也好，都是为了这个目标，只是分工不同。厂长组织生产经营离不开人的工作，党委的思想工作也必须渗透到生产经营过程中才能开展，都是要围绕发展生产力这个中心工作的，怎么会出现“两层皮”呢？过去由于赵紫阳同志错误的干扰，许多地方削弱了思想政治工作。当务之急是厂长、经理和书记从党和国家的利益考虑，认识加强思想政治工作的重要性与迫切性，不要因为考虑谁的权力大谁的权力小而在一些问题上争论不休。
    省委副书记、省长李长春和其他领导同志在锦州、营口、大连调查研究中发现，一些厂长、经理看到在惩治腐败中处理了几个厂长，就认为是整他们的信号，情绪不高。因此，省委负责同志解剖案例，用事实向厂长、经理说明，腐败分子在打击之列，但不能因为出了个别蜕化变质分子，就改变对这支队伍的基本估计。要注意把企业里正常的经营活动、业务来往（包括这方面工作上的失误）与腐败行为区分开来。要认真总结经验，对的，坚持；不对的，改过来。要下决心把改革、开放搞得更好。
