The State Price Bureau recently issued a notice guiding local authorities to appropriately lower the prices of certain refrigerators, blankets, and other goods.

The notice directs local authorities to appropriately lower the prices of certain refrigerators, with the price reduction generally controlled within 15%. Pure wool blankets will also see an appropriate price reduction. For 2.8-kilogram patterned wool blankets with a retail price of over 240 yuan, the price reduction will be around 10%.

The notice also mentions that since the 13 types of national brand liquors had their prices appropriately reduced starting from March 9th of this year, their prices remain relatively high.

For electric fans and some seasonal goods, the notice requires local authorities to implement seasonal price differences based on the situation, with prices appropriately reduced.
