As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches, the 20 million people of various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia are filled with confidence in the future of our great socialist motherland and profound respect and love for the glorious Communist Party of China.

Since the founding of New China, under the correct guidance of the Party's national policies, Inner Mongolia has gradually established a new type of socialist ethnic relations characterized by equality, unity, and mutual assistance. The economy and society have undergone tremendous changes. In 1988, compared to 1947, the total social output value of the region increased by 24.6 times, national income by 20.5 times, and the total industrial and agricultural output value by 35 times. The number of students in all types of schools increased by 15 times, and ethnic education has made significant progress. At the same time, the development of other undertakings of ethnic minorities has flourished, especially the cultivation of a large number of ethnic minority cadres. Under the care of the Party and the state, the various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have united and worked hard, almost starting from scratch, and have painted a magnificent picture. The people of all ethnic groups deeply understand that without the Communist Party of China and without the socialist path, there would be no liberation and emancipation for the people of all ethnic groups, and even less prosperity and development for Inner Mongolia.

The convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee marked a new chapter in the history of Inner Mongolia. Over the past decade, the economic strength of the region has grown several times over, and science, education, and cultural undertakings have made significant progress. People's living standards have significantly improved. These ten years have been the fastest-developing decade for the economy and society of our region, and the decade in which the people have benefited the most. The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have benefited from the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and from the "one center, two basic points." They are determined to unswervingly adhere to the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state and to unswervingly adhere to the path of reform and opening up as the path to national strength.

Inner Mongolia is a border region with ethnic autonomy, and stability and unity have always been the top priorities. The various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have, through long-term interactions and joint struggles, developed a relationship of mutual assistance and love, sharing weal and woe, and have become "inseparable." They have thus earned the title of "model autonomous region." This strong unity based on common ideals and beliefs has not been fundamentally shaken even during the ten years of turmoil. Our Party and people highly value this unity and regard it as a reliable political foundation and guarantee for all undertakings in Inner Mongolia.

The glorious tradition of ethnic unity in Inner Mongolia is worthy of pride, and the great achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over 42 years are inspiring. However, we have no reason to be complacent; instead, we feel that the task ahead is heavy and the road is long. In economic construction, we must see our advantages: our region is an ethnic autonomous region, and the Party's policies and the state's laws have given us many special rights, which is our political advantage; our region has unique resource conditions, not only rich mineral resources but also more abundant land and above-ground resources; our region spans the "three northern regions," borders eight provinces (regions), is close to Beijing and Tianjin, connects with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, and has superior geographical conditions for development and opening up. In addition, we face two major opportunities: the state's focus on developing energy, raw materials, and other basic industries, and the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, which have created a good environment for our region's opening up.

Based on the above conditions and opportunities, we have proposed three near-term goals for economic development: on the basis of striving to develop production, raise the living standards of urban and rural residents to the middle and above level in the country; on the basis of coordinated development of forestry, animal husbandry, agriculture, and industry, gradually achieve self-sufficiency in grain; on the premise of continuously improving economic benefits, gradually increase the fiscal self-sufficiency rate and enhance fiscal self-reliance. To this end, we have formulated the guiding principle of "unity, construction, reform, and opening up," proposed the opening strategy of "connecting the south and opening the north, pushing forward in two directions, serving the whole country, and revitalizing Inner Mongolia," and set the "three-step" steps of "three years of foundation, five years of leap, and small prosperity by the end of the century."

With the favorable timing of encountering two major opportunities, the geographical advantage of being "four directions and eight reaches," and the human advantage of ethnic unity and social stability, through the hard work of the people of all ethnic groups, we will definitely be able to achieve our grand goals, realize the common prosperity of all ethnic groups, and make greater contributions to the socialist motherland.

　　在改革开放中振兴内蒙古

    在国庆40周年即将到来的时候，内蒙古两千万各族人民对伟大的社会主义祖国的前途满怀必胜的信念，对光荣的中国共产党充满崇敬和爱戴之情。
    新中国成立以来，在党的民族政策的正确指引下，内蒙古逐步建立了平等、团结、互助的社会主义新型民族关系，经济社会发生了翻天覆地的变化。1988年同1947年相比，全区社会总产值增长24.6倍，国民收入增长20.5倍，工农业总产值增长35倍，各类学校在校学生数增长15倍，特别是民族教育事业得到了很大发展。与此同时，少数民族的其他各项事业得到蓬勃发展，特别是培养成长起来一大批少数民族干部。在党和国家的关怀下，内蒙古各族人民同心同德，艰苦创业，几乎是在一张白纸上，绘出了雄伟壮丽的画图。各族人民深切认识到：离开中国共产党，离开社会主义道路，就没有各族人民的翻身解放，更没有内蒙古的繁荣兴旺。
    党的十一届三中全会的召开，揭开了内蒙古历史的新篇章。十年间，全区国民经济实力成倍增长，科技、教育、文化事业得到长足发展，人民生活显著改善。这十年是我区经济社会发展最快的十年，是人民群众得到实惠最多的十年。内蒙古各族人民得益于十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，得益于“一个中心、两个基本点”，决心坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本，坚定不移地坚持改革开放这条强国之路。
    内蒙古是地处边疆的民族区域自治之地，安定团结始终是第一位的工作。内蒙古各族人民在长期的交往和共同的奋斗中，互助互爱，患难与共，结成了“谁也离不开谁”的血肉关系，曾因此获得“模范自治区”的赞誉。这种基于共同理想和信念的坚强团结，即使在十年内乱中也不曾从根本上动摇过。我们的党和人民十分珍视这种团结，把它看作是内蒙古各项事业的可靠的政治基础和基本保证。
    内蒙古民族团结的光荣传统是值得自豪的，内蒙古自治区42年的伟大成就是令人鼓舞的。但是，我们没有丝毫理由自满，而是深感任重道远。我们在经济建设中要看到自己的优势：我区是民族区域自治地方，党的政策和国家的法律给了我们许多特殊的权利，这是我们的政治优势；我区有得天独厚的资源条件，不仅矿藏丰富，而且有着更加丰富的土地资源、地上资源；我区地跨“三北”，毗邻八省（区），靠近京津，连接苏蒙，有着发展开放、联合的优越地理条件。此外，我们还面临两大机遇：国家重点发展能源、原材料等基础工业，中苏关系实现正常化，这为我区的对外开放创造了良好的大气候。
    基于上述条件和机遇，我们提出了发展经济的三项近期奋斗目标：在努力发展生产的基础上，城乡人民生活达到国内中等以上水平；在林牧农工协调发展的基础上，逐步实现粮食基本自给；在不断提高经济效益的前提下，逐步提高财政自给率，增强财政自立能力。为此，我们确定了“团结、建设、改革、开放”的指导方针，提出了“南联北开、双向推进、服务全国、振兴内蒙”的开放战略，制定了“三年打基础、五年上台阶、本世纪末达小康”的小“三步曲”步骤。
    我们内蒙古逢两大机遇之天时，占“四通八达”之地利，得民族团结、社会安定之人和，通过各族人民的艰苦奋斗，一定能够达到我们的宏伟目标，实现各民族的共同繁荣，为社会主义祖国做出更大贡献。
