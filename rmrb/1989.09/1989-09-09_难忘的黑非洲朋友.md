I will never forget the grand event at the Gabonese seaside this July, nor the deep affection of the people of the Bantu nations of Black Africa for the Chinese people.

The plane descended slowly. From the window, I gazed down upon the earth. The azure sea and the verdant forest were adorned with a gleaming white pearl—Libreville. The Fifth Session of the Council of Ministers of Culture of the Member States of the International Bantu Cultural Center and the Third Bantu Modern Art Biennial were being held here.

Obonja, the General Secretary

He was tall and robust, dignified and courteous, with a subtle, discerning air beneath his diplomatic charm. This was Professor Obonja, who had served as the Congolese Minister of Foreign Affairs for five years and was now the General Secretary of the International Bantu Cultural Center.

The International Bantu Cultural Center was established in 1983 under the initiative of Gabonese President Bongo. Its purpose is to develop and protect the true values and common heritage of the Bantu cultural tradition. Currently, 10 Black African nations have joined the organization, with its headquarters in Libreville, the capital of Gabon.

In the afternoon of the day I arrived in Libreville, Mr. Obonja received me in the office of the center's headquarters. His strong, powerful hand firmly grasped mine as he said with deep emotion, "China is the most reliable friend of the Black African nations. We have discussed cooperation with Chinese friends and are even more willing to cooperate with the Chinese government in the development of the center's work in the future." Then, the General Secretary introduced to me the center's achievements and existing problems over the past few years. From his smiling face, one could see his genuine joy at the center's achievements.

On the evening of July 10, the Hilton Hotel ballroom was brightly lit. Amidst the strong rhythms of traditional African music and dance, the Third Bantu Modern Art Biennial opened. As I entered this hall of African modern art, I was immediately captivated by the artworks rich in African characteristics, to the point that someone had to tap my shoulder to wake me from my reverie. Turning around, I saw it was Mr. Obonja. He asked, "What is your impression of the exhibition?" I said, "It is excellent, showcasing the strong sense of roots among Bantu artists and their new creations in the fusion of tradition and modernity." "Thank you!" Mr. Obonja extended his hand to strike mine, a habit among Africans to express joy.

In his speech at the opening of the art exhibition, Mr. Obonja specially mentioned China, saying, "Today, we are very honored to have Chinese friends attend the opening of the art exhibition. We hope to have more opportunities to exchange with China in the future..." After his speech, he invited me to the stage and introduced me to the Gabonese Vice President and the cultural ministers of various countries. Among the numerous guests from various countries, I was honored in such a manner, feeling proud as a Chinese.

Mr. Obonja also specially signed a document appointing me to the art exhibition's jury. On the afternoon of July 11, the awarding ceremony was held in the exhibition hall. The jury members were serious and diligent. In the first round of voting, Gabonese artist Onayin's oil painting "Explosion" (see left image) and another artist's work from a different country received the same number of highest votes. During the re-evaluation, after a moment of intense and swift thought, I felt that the Gabonese artist's symbolic work "Explosion" had a profound theme, strongly expressing the sense of roots among Black African artists—the attitude of inheriting traditional culture and developing national art. Therefore, I unhesitatingly voted for this artwork.

Mr. Mwandanda

The sea breeze was gentle, and the waves sparkled. Mr. Mwandanda and I chatted on the platform of the seaside Hilton Hotel. Mr. Mwandanda had previously served as the chief advisor to the Zairian Ministry of Culture and is now the director of Mr. Obonja's office, having worked in Libreville for four years. As we looked at the distant white sails on the Atlantic, he said:

"Black African countries and China have similar historical experiences and both belong to the Third World. Therefore, China is closer to us and has many things worth learning from. China and we also have a common mission, which is also the mission of the International Bantu Cultural Center—to create our own modern culture." At that moment, a large ship approached from the distance. Listening to his words, I was suddenly inspired and said with deep emotion, "Yes, China and Black African countries are like being on the same ship. We have the same tragic past of being oppressed by imperialism and also have the common mission of creating a bright future. No matter what storms and waves we encounter, as long as we stand together, we will definitely reach the shore of victory." Looking at the slowly approaching ship, our two hands tightly clasped together.

Although I have been away from Gabon for many days, the sincere Black African friends remain unforgettable. During the days I spent with them, my greatest gain was realizing who our true friends are in today's world.

    难忘的黑非洲朋友
    梁宇
    忘不了今年7月加蓬海滨的盛会，更忘不了黑非洲班图各国人民对中国人民的深情厚谊……
    飞机徐徐降落，从舷窗俯瞰大地，蔚蓝色的大海和翠绿色的森林中间镶嵌着一颗白色的明珠——利伯维尔。国际班图文化中心第五届成员国文化部长会议和第三届班图现代艺术双年展在这里举行。
    奥邦加总干事
    他高大魁悟，彬彬有礼，在潇洒的外交风度中隐藏着机敏、善于思辨的气质。这就是人文科学教授、曾任五年刚果外交部长、如今担任国际班图文化中心总干事的奥邦加先生。
    国际班图文化中心是1983年在加蓬邦戈总统的倡议下创立的国际组织。其宗旨是，发展和保护班图民族文化传统的真正价值和共同遗产。目前有10个黑非洲国家加入该组织。总部设在加蓬首都利伯维尔。
    在我抵达利伯维尔的当日下午，奥邦加先生便在中心总部办公室会见了我。他那粗壮有力的手紧紧地握着我的手深情地说：“中国是黑非洲国家最可信赖的朋友，我们曾和中国朋友探讨过合作的方式，今后更愿与中国政府合作发展中心的事业。”随后，总干事先生向我介绍了中心最近几年所取得的成就和存在的问题。从他那笑容可掬的面庞上看得出他为中心的成就而感到由衷的喜悦。
    7月10日晚希尔顿饭店大厅灯火辉煌，在非洲传统音乐舞蹈的强烈节奏声中，第三届班图现代艺术双年展开幕。当我走进这座非洲现代艺术的殿堂，顿时被非洲特色浓郁的艺术品所吸引，以至于有人在背后拍我的肩才醒悟。回头一看，原来是奥邦加先生，他问我：“对展览的印象如何？”我说：“非常出色，表现了班图艺术家强烈的寻根意识，在传统与现代的结合方面有新的创造。”“谢谢！”奥邦加先生伸出手与我击掌，这是非洲人表示高兴的习惯。
    在艺术展开幕式的致词中，奥邦加先生特别提到了中国，他说：“今天，我们非常荣幸有中国朋友出席艺术展开幕式，希望今后有更多的机会与中国进行交流……。”讲完话，他把我请到主席台，并一一介绍给加蓬副总理和各国文化部长。在众多的各国来宾面前，我受到如此殊荣，感到作为一个中国人的骄傲。
    奥邦加总干事还特意签署文件，聘请我参加艺术展评审委员会。7月11日下午，评奖工作在展厅内举行。评委们严肃而认真，第一轮投票结果，加蓬艺术家奥奈因的油画《爆炸》（见左图）和另一国某艺术家的作品获相同数目的最高票。复评时，在紧张而迅速地思考之后，我觉得加蓬艺术家的象征主义作品《爆炸》的主题很深刻，强烈地表现了黑非洲艺术家的寻根意识——继承传统文化，发展民族艺术的心态。因此，我毫不犹豫地投了这幅作品一票。
    姆当达先生
    海风和煦，碧波粼粼，我和姆当达先生在临海的希尔顿饭店平台上聊天。姆当达先生曾任扎伊尔文化部主要顾问，现在是奥邦加总干事的办公室主任，已在利伯维尔工作四年了。我们望着大西洋远处的点点白帆聊着，他说：
  “黑非洲国家和中国有着同样的历史遭遇，同属第三世界。因此，中国和我们更接近，有许多值得我们学习的东西。中国和我们也有着共同的使命，这也是国际班图文化中心的使命——创造自己民族的现代文化。”这时，远处开来一艘巨轮，听着他的话我突发联想，无限感慨地说：“是的，中国和黑非洲国家如同在一艘巨轮上，我们有着同样遭受帝国主义奴役的悲惨过去，也有着创造光明未来的共同使命，不管遇到什么样狂风恶浪，只要我们同舟共济，就一定能抵达胜利的彼岸。”望着缓缓开来的巨轮，我们的两只手紧紧地握在一起。
    虽然离开加蓬许多天了，但是真诚的黑非洲朋友使我久久不能忘怀。在和他们相处的日子里，我最大的收获是认识到当今世界上谁是我们真正的朋友。
