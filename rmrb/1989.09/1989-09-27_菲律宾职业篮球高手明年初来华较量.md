The Philippine men's basketball team, which will include professional players, will make their first visit to China to compete in Wuhan next January. It was learned today from the Basketball Department of the State Sports Commission that the teams participating in this invitational tournament will include China, Chinese Taipei, the West Asia All-Star Team, and the Philippine team. Each team is allowed to have two professional players.

The Asian Basketball Federation recently decided to allow Asian professional players to participate in competitions, which poses a certain threat to China's leading position. According to basketball insiders, the Philippines has a relatively developed professional basketball system and will be the biggest beneficiary of this decision. Their appearance in Wuhan next January will serve as a preview for next year's Asian Games.

Additionally, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the invention of basketball, China will hold a series of celebratory activities in 1991. These activities will include issuing commemorative stamps, inviting the Soviet Union and the U.S. teams to compete in China, organizing a "Sprout Cup" national basketball tournament for children aged 12 to 14, and inviting the Chinese Taipei team for a visit.

Basketball was invented by American James Naismith in 1891.

    菲律宾职业篮球高手明年初来华较量
    新华社北京9月26日电　（记者徐济成、曲北林）明年1月有职业选手加盟的菲律宾男子篮球队将首次到我国武汉比赛。今天从国家体委篮球处获悉，参加这次邀请赛的有中国、中国台北、西亚联队和菲律宾队。每队允许有两名职业选手参赛。
    亚篮联前不久决定允许亚洲的职业选手参赛，使中国队的领先地位受到一定威胁。据篮球界人士分析，菲律宾的职业篮球运动比较发达，将是这项决定的最大受惠国。明年1月他们在武汉的亮相，将成为明年亚运会的火力侦察赛。
    另讯，为纪念篮球运动发明100周年，我国将在1991年举行一系列的庆祝活动。内容包括：发行纪念邮票，邀请苏联、美国队来华比赛，组织12岁到14岁少年儿童参加的“萌芽杯”全国篮球赛，邀请中华台北队来访。
    篮球运动是美国人詹姆斯·奈史密斯1891年发明的。
