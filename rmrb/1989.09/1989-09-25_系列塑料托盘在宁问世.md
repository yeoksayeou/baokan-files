The Nanjing Jinling Petrochemical Company's Plastic Factory has recently produced a series of plastic pallets with wings using domestic raw materials, filling a gap in the domestic transportation and storage industry.

Compared to wooden and steel pallets, plastic pallets have the advantages of being lightweight, having good integrity, no nails or splinters, a smooth surface, non-toxic, adjustable color, acid and alkali resistance, easy to clean, and mold-resistant. The structure is reasonable and can be forked from all four sides. The four sides have wings, which can make the goods and the pallet into a single unit. Stacking three layers can prevent slipping, and stacking and forklifting will not cause tilting or collapsing. They are particularly suitable for the storage and transportation of food, beverages, aquatic products, pharmaceuticals, and other industries.

    系列塑料托盘在宁问世
    本报讯　南京金陵石油化工公司塑料厂利用国产原料，新近生产出系列化塑料带翅托盘，填补了国内运输贮存行业的一项空白。
    塑料托盘与木质、钢质托盘相比，具有重量轻、整体性好、无钉无刺、表面光洁、无毒、色泽可调、耐酸碱易清洗、防霉烂等优点。结构合理、可四面叉运。四边带翅，可使货物和托盘成为一个整体。码垛三层能防滑，堆码叉运不会歪斜散垛。尤其适合食品、饮料、水产品、医药等行业的贮运。　（金石）
