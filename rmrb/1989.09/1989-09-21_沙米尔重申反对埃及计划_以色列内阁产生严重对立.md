	Shamir Reiterates Opposition to Egypt's Plan
	Serious Disagreement Erupts in Israeli Cabinet

	Cairo, September 20 (Reported by Lin Jiaoming) Israeli Prime Minister Shamir today reiterated his opposition to the Egyptian government's 10-point plan regarding elections for Palestinians in the occupied territories. This has led to a serious disagreement within the Israeli cabinet.

	Shamir's firm stance is reflected in two key issues: opposition to the participation of Palestinian representatives from outside the occupied territories in the proposed direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and opposition to the participation of Palestinians from East Jerusalem in the elections.

	Shamir's statement came after his meeting with Defense Minister Rabin, who had visited Egypt on September 18.

	According to reports, the two major factions in the Israeli cabinet, the Likud bloc and the Labor Party, have sharp disagreements on these points, even threatening the agreement to form a coalition government. Rabin's visit to Egypt and his agreement to hold direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian representatives have caused unrest within the cabinet. Rabin has expressed that he does not mind the participation of Palestinian representatives from outside the occupied territories in the talks, which is clearly at odds with Shamir's position.

    沙米尔重申反对埃及计划
    以色列内阁产生严重对立
    本报开罗9月20日电　记者林皎明报道：以色列总理沙米尔今天重申他反对埃及政府有关被占领土巴勒斯坦人选举的10点计划。以色列内阁就此产生严重对立。
    沙米尔的僵硬立场具体表现在两个关键问题上：反对巴勒斯坦被占领土以外的巴勒斯坦代表参加拟议中的以巴直接谈判，反对东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦人参加选举。
    以色列总理的表态是在同18日访问埃及的国防部长拉宾会谈后作出的。
    据报道，以色列内阁中利库德集团和工党两大派在上述分歧焦点上产生尖锐对立，甚至威胁到联合组阁的协议。拉宾出访埃及，同意举行以巴代表团直接会谈，在内阁引起骚动。拉宾曾表示不介意被占领土以外巴勒斯坦代表参加谈判，与沙米尔的立场显然对立。
