Since the founding of the People's Republic, facing numerous challenges, the Party and the government regarded learning from and drawing on the experiences of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as an important measure to accelerate the development of China's economic construction and other undertakings.

In August 1951, China sent its first batch of 375 students to study in the Soviet Union. Before that, in 1950, China had already sent 25 students to study in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Starting from 1952, China began to send students abroad in batches every year, with the number ranging from over 200 to over 2,000. By 1966, China had sent more than 10,000 students to 29 countries, with approximately 90% going to the Soviet Union.

The Party and the government also paid great attention to the work of inviting overseas students from the old China to return and serve the country. In December 1949, the Central People's Government's State Council Cultural Committee established the Committee for the Affairs of Overseas Students to handle the return of overseas students and scholars. By the end of 1952, the committee had received more than 2,000 returning overseas students and scholars and arranged for them to work in economic departments, administrative departments, universities, and research institutions.

By the time the Cultural Revolution began, China had accepted more than 7,200 foreign students from 60 countries on five continents to study in 154 majors at 55 universities in China.

After the start of the Cultural Revolution, China temporarily stopped educational exchanges with the outside world. With the restoration of China's legal seat in the United Nations, China resumed sending students abroad and accepting foreign students in 1972 and 1973, respectively. By 1976, China had sent 1,629 students to 49 countries and accepted 1,667 students from 65 countries and regions.

The reform and opening-up policy established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee enabled China's educational undertakings to develop towards modernization, the future, and the world. In 1978, facing the urgent need for talent in the rapidly developing economy, the Central Committee proposed the policy of sending a large number of students abroad. In 1978 alone, more than 800 people were sent abroad. The number increased to over 1,700 in 1979 and over 2,000 in 1980. Since 1982, the number of students sent abroad each year has exceeded 3,000. In the past 10 years of reform and opening-up, the cumulative number of students sent abroad under the state plan has exceeded twice the number sent before the reform and opening-up. In addition to the state plan, since 1982, various local, departmental, and unit-level entities have also raised funds to send out a roughly equivalent number of students. Now, the countries and regions where Chinese students study have increased from 32 before the reform and opening-up to 76 today.

At the same time, Chinese universities and educational departments have actively created conditions to expand the scale and capacity of accepting foreign students. In 1978, the scale of accepting foreign students was only over 400, but by 1988, it had increased to over 3,800, a ninefold increase.

The number of countries sending students to China has increased from 60 before the reform and opening-up to over 110 today.

In the past 40 years, we have accepted more than 22,000 long-term foreign students and over 40,000 short-term students from more than 100 countries. These students have played an active role in developing friendship with the Chinese people and participating in the construction of their own countries after returning home.

In the past 40 years, China has sent more than 70,000 students abroad, with over 40,000 returning after completing their studies. Returning students have made important contributions to solving many major issues in China's construction in various periods and fields and to laying the foundation for China's independent and autonomous higher education and scientific research system. Among them, many have taken on important leadership roles in the Party and the state.

　　对外教育交流四十年
　　出国留学七万人　学成归来四万多　接受外国来华留学生六万多
    建国之初，面对来自各方面的巨大挑战，党和政府把学习和借鉴苏联及其他社会主义国家的经验，作为我国经济建设和其他各项事业加快发展的重要措施之一。
    1951年8月，我国向苏联派出了第一批留学生375名。在此之前，我国已于1950年向波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚派出留学生25名。从1952年开始，我国每年都成批地派留学生出国学习，每年少则200多人，多则2000多人。到1966年时，已向29个国家派出一万多名留学人员，其中约90％前往苏联。
    党和政府还十分重视旧中国时期出国的留学人员回国服务的工作。1949年12月，中央人民政府政务院文化委员会成立了留学生事务委员会，统一办理留学生、学者回国事宜。到1952年底，该委员会共接待回国留学生及学者2000余人，并安排他们到经济部门、行政部门、高等学校和科研单位工作。
    截至“文化大革命”开始时为止，我国还接受了五大洲60个国家的7200多名外国留学生来华，在我国55所高等学校的154个专业里学习。
      “文革”开始后，我国曾一度停止对外教育交流。随着我国在联合国合法席位的恢复，我国分别从1972年和1973年起恢复向国外派遣留学生和接受来华留学生的工作。截至1976年，我国共向49个国家派遣留学人员1629人，接受65个国家和地区的留学人员1667人。
    党的十一届三中全会确立的改革、开放的方针，使我国的教育事业有可能朝着面向现代化、面向未来、面向世界的方向发展。1978年，面对经济建设大发展而急需人才的情况，党中央提出了要大批向国外派遣留学生的政策。1978年当年，就派出800多人。1979年迅速增加到1700多人，1980年超过2000人。从1982年以后至今，每年都超过3000人。改革开放10年来，国家计划内派出的各类留学人员的累计数已超过改革开放前的两倍。除国家计划外，1982年以来，各地方、部门、单位还自筹资金派出了与国家计划数大致相当数量的留学人员。现在，我国留学人员前往的国别和地区，已从改革开放前的32个，增加到现在的76个。
    与此同时，我国高等学校和教育部门积极创造条件，扩大接受外国留学生的能力和规模。1978年，我国接受外国留学生的规模仅为400多人，到1988年，接受规模已增加到3800多人，增加了9倍。
    来华留学生的国别从改革开放前的60个国家和地区增加到110多个国家和地区。
    建国40年来，我们共接受了100多个国家的2.2万多名长期来华留学生和4万多名短期留学生。这些留学生回国后对发展与中国人民的友谊和参加自己国家的建设事业发挥了积极作用。
    40年来，我国共派出7万多人出国留学，学成回国的已逾4万多人。归国留学生在我国社会主义建设各个时期和各个领域，对解决我国建设事业中的许多重大课题和奠定我国独立自主的高等教育及科学研究工作体系的基础作出了重要贡献。他们当中，担任党和国家重要领导工作的也不乏其人。
