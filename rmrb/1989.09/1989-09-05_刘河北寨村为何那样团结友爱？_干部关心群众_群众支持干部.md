	Currently, the relationship between cadres and the masses in some rural areas is quite tense, and improving this relationship has become an unavoidable issue. In improving cadre-mass relations, the cadres in Liuhe Beizhai Village, Baiguoshu Township, our county, have three effective strategies.

	The first strategy is to reduce the burden on farmers. Arbitrary levies are a major cause of tension between cadres and the masses. Now, with the strengthening of the collective economy in Liuhe Beizhai Village, the village can collect nearly 50,000 yuan in contract fees from collective enterprises each year. Most of this is used to pay for the farmers' agricultural taxes, educational surcharges, cadre subsidies, and other deductions on behalf of the masses. The remaining amount is all used to help farmers become wealthy, and the masses are naturally pleased.

	The second strategy is to serve the masses wholeheartedly. They consider serving the masses and helping everyone become wealthy as their honorable duty. The village committee director, Liu Yingrui, and the accountant, Liu Yongyan, and a few other cadres, purchased 150 tons of diesel from Liaoning this year and sold it to the masses at the purchase price. They also sold on credit to 8,000 yuan worth of goods to impoverished farmers. In previous years, the village party branch also purchased 38,000 high-quality apple tree saplings from Tai'an City, Shandong Province, for one yuan each, and sold them to the masses for 50 cents each. Out of the 164 households in the village, 140 have planted apple trees. The village cadres also obtained support from the county science association, helping 28 farmers develop 300 mu of pollution-free vegetables. Each year, the village spends 1,500 yuan to provide free technical guidance to the farmers. The average income per mu of vegetables is 1,200 yuan. In 1985, this village built 17 high-quality school buildings, dug wells, constructed water towers, and ensured that farmers had access to tap water, with a total investment of 70,000 yuan, without asking the farmers for a single cent.

	The third strategy is to be honest and transparent with finances. Every economic expenditure in the village must be approved by the deputy director of the village committee, the accountant, and the cashier before it can be made. At the end of each month, the party branch secretary, members of the ethics review committee, and party member representatives review it once. At the end of each year, all economic income and expenditure accounts and original vouchers for the year are presented to the masses, and the masses are welcome to check them item by item. The income and expenditure situation is also posted on the wall for the masses to review. Moreover, the village cadres do not seek special treatment or take advantage of their positions. They believe that the more special treatment cadres receive, the less authority they have among the masses.

	Cadres care for the masses, and the masses support the cadres. In May, during the family planning campaign, the village cadres held a meeting the night before, and the next day, they contacted the county hospital. On the third day, all 23 sterilization candidates had the operation done. This summer, during the harvest, the acting party branch secretary, Liu Ziming, arranged for the masses to thresh the grain during the day, while he worked late into the night threshing his own grain. Seeing that he needed more help, about a dozen people voluntarily went to assist him.

    刘河北寨村为何那样团结友爱？
    干部关心群众  群众支持干部
    当前，有的农村干群关系比较紧张，改善干群关系已是一个不可回避的问题。在改善干群关系中，我县白果树乡刘河北寨村干部有三手“高招”。
    头一手是减轻了农民负担。农村乱摊派是造成干群关系紧张的一个重要原因。现在，随着刘河北寨村集体经济力量的壮大，村里每年从集体企业中可提出承包费近5万元，大部分用于替群众交纳农业税、教育经费附加、干部补贴等项提留，剩余部分全部用于帮助农民致富上，群众自然高兴。
    第二手是尽力为群众服务。他们把为群众服务，帮助大家致富当作自己的光荣职责。村委会主任刘英瑞、会计刘永言等几名干部，今年从辽宁为群众购进150吨柴油，按购进价卖给群众，还向困难的农民赊销了8000元。前几年村党支部还从山东泰安市购进一元一株的优种苹果树苗38000多株，按每株5角钱卖给群众。全村164户，有140户栽种了苹果树。村干部还取得县科协的支持，帮助28户农民发展无公害蔬菜300多亩，每年由村出钱1500元，向农民提供无偿技术指导。每亩蔬菜平均收入1200元。这个村1985年盖起了17间高质量的校舍，打了井、建了水塔，让农民吃上了自来水，共投资7万元，没让农民拿一分钱。
    第三手是不贪不占，财务公开。全村每一笔经济开支、必须经村委会副主任、会计、现金保管员三人批准方可开支。每月月底由党支部书记、道德评议会成员和党员群众代表审查一次。每年年底，把全年的经济收支账目和原始单据全部亮给群众，欢迎群众逐笔检查，并将收支情况公布上墙，让群众评议。且村干部不搞特殊，不占便宜，他们认为，干部多一份特殊，在群众中就少一份威信。
    干部关心群众，群众支持干部。今年5月份搞计划生育时，头天晚上村干部开了会，第二天干部跟县医院联系好，第三天23名绝育对象全部做了结扎手术。今年夏收遇上了阴雨天气，党支部代理书记刘自明白天忙着安排群众打场，自己则晚上加班打场。群众见他家人手不够，有10几个人主动去帮忙。
