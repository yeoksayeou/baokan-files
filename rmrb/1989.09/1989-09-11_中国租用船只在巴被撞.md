Chinese-chartered ship collides in Panama

A cargo ship, "Zhicheng," chartered by China from the Hong Kong Far East Shipping Company, was damaged after a collision near the entrance of the Panama Canal. After emergency repairs, the ship was completely salvaged by September 9th. The seawater that had entered the first and second holds has been pumped out, and most of the 9,000 tons of wheat in the holds remains intact, with only a small amount affected by water.
