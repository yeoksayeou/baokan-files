In recent years, severe criminal cases such as murder, injury, explosions, arson, and poisoning have frequently occurred due to the escalation of civil disputes. According to an investigation in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, the number of severe criminal cases triggered by the escalation of civil disputes has been on the rise since 1980: 8 cases in 1980, 20 cases in 1985, and 40 cases in 1988.

Civil disputes that escalate into severe cases often have underlying issues, such as long-standing grudges. Some cases are sudden and accidental, triggered by trivial matters or arguments, and the perpetrators regret their actions afterward. These cases also tend to be brutal and persistent, with criminals using extremely violent methods, disregarding consequences, and refusing to stop until their goals are achieved.

In Lianyungang City, such cases mainly fall into two categories: one is due to disputes over love, marriage, adultery, and neighborhood issues, accounting for 78.2% of the total; the other is due to economic disputes over contracts, boundaries, and other economic interests.

The proliferation of decadent and backward ideologies is the root cause of the increase in such cases. For example, in rural areas, forced arranged marriages, swapping relatives, patriarchal authority, paternal authority, and clan feudal thoughts can all lead to disputes and escalate into severe cases. On the other hand, the widespread dissemination of books, audio-visual products with content related to murder, brawls, obscenity, and even reactionary materials has led many people, especially young individuals, to become obsessed and easily commit crimes when provoked.

The legal awareness and cultural level of these criminals are generally low. Among the 149 individuals involved in these cases, the majority are illiterate. These individuals lack knowledge of the law, do not fear legal consequences, have poor self-control, and some even believe they are not wrong after committing crimes.

The ineffective resolution of civil disputes is a significant reason for the increase in such cases. Relevant personnel have ignored the new situations and problems arising from internal contradictions among the people in the new era, lacking awareness and ineffective measures. Many units have not included dispute resolution in their job responsibilities, or they do so merely as a formality. Basic-level mediation organizations are weak, and judicial assistants are either not adequately staffed or are reassigned, leaving the grassroots level unattended. Relevant departments often pass the buck, leading some people to take matters into their own hands when they find no recourse.

It is essential to strengthen socialist legal education, moral education, and cultural knowledge education as a crucial guarantee and fundamental measure to prevent the escalation of conflicts. Various forms of education should be employed, combining typical cases to vividly propagate and educate the masses. This will help them understand what constitutes illegal and criminal behavior, how to handle disputes, and how to protect their legal rights. It will also encourage them to voluntarily adhere to socialist legal and moral norms, thereby reducing disputes and preventing impulsive crimes.

It is necessary to further improve mediation organizations and fully utilize their role as the first line of defense. Conduct in-depth investigations and research, focus on collecting and feedback information on various types of disputes, and enhance the ability to predict, prevent, and control the escalation of conflicts. Establish a system of household mediators and village, community, and group information officers to promptly identify disputes.

The author believes that for severe criminal cases triggered by bureaucratism or illegal activities, in addition to severely punishing the criminals, the relevant personnel directly responsible should also be held accountable, including criminal liability.

### 要重视调解民间纠纷

    要重视调解民间纠纷
    宋继奎
    近年来，因民间纠纷激化而引发的杀人、伤害、爆炸、放火、投毒等重大恶性案件屡有发生。据对江苏省连云港市的调查，1980年以来，民间纠纷激化引发重大刑事案件呈上升趋势：1980年8起，1985年20起，1988年40起。
    民间纠纷激化引发的重大案件有的有潜在性，即当事早有宿怨；有的有突发性和偶然性，起因于琐事或口角，案发后凶犯后悔莫及；还具有凶残性和持续性，案犯往往用极其凶残的手段实施犯罪，不计后果，有些人甚至不达目的决不罢休。
    从连云港市的情况看，这类案件主要有两类：一类是因恋爱、婚姻、奸情、邻里纠纷引起的，占总数的78.2％；一类是由经济承包、合同、地界等经济利益引起的。
    各种腐朽没落思想的影响，是这类案件增多的思想根源。如农村中强迫包办婚姻、转亲换亲、夫权、父权、家族宗法思想等等，都可能引发纠纷并激化为恶性案件。另一方面，一些凶杀、械斗、色情淫秽甚至反动内容的书刊音像制品大肆泛滥，许多人特别是青少年走火入魔，遇到诱因便容易犯罪。
    这类犯罪者的法律意识和文化素质都很差。在149名作案成员中，文盲占多数。这些人不知法，不知畏法，自制能力差，有的犯罪后还认为自己没有错。
    民间纠纷的缓解工作不够得力，是这类案件上升的重要原因。有关工作人员对新形势下人民内部矛盾出现的新情况、新问题视而不见，心中无数；对已发生或有激化迹象的纠纷耳目不灵，措施不力，使本来可以避免的未能避免；有许多单位未把缓解纠纷工作纳入岗位责任制中，或流于形式，有名无实；基层调解组织松散，司法助理员配备不齐，或被抽作他用，使基层处于无人问事状态；有关部门对处理矛盾纠纷互相推诿，致使有的人因投告无门，忍无可忍而“自行解决”。
    应该看到，加强社会主义法制教育、道德教育和文化知识教育，是预防矛盾激化的重要保证和治本措施。必须运用多种形式，结合典型案例，形象生动地进行宣传教育，使广大群众明白什么是违法、犯罪，遇到纠纷应该怎么办，怎样维护自己的合法权益，自觉地把自己的言行约束在社会主义法律和道德的规范之内，从而减少纠纷，防止激情犯罪。
    应进一步健全调解组织，充分发挥第一道防线的作用。深入开展调查研究，抓好各类矛盾纠纷的信息收集、反馈，提高预测、预防和控制矛盾激化的能力。建立联户调解员和乡、村、组信息员制度，及时发现纠纷。
    笔者认为，对于因官僚主义或因违法乱纪而“逼”出来的重大刑事案件，除了严惩犯罪分子外，还应追究负有直接责任的有关人员的责任，直至追究刑事责任。
