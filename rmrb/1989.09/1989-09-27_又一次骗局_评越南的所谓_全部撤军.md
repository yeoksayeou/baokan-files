Title: Another Deception – Evaluating Vietnam's Alleged "Complete Withdrawal"

The Vietnamese authorities have claimed that their "final batch" of 26,000 troops withdrew from Cambodia on September 26. In Vietnam's view, it no longer has a single soldier in Cambodia; however, the international community has generally expressed skepticism about this.

Since 1982, Vietnam's "withdrawal" has been a repeated farce. This time, the Vietnamese authorities, in order to prove that this move is different, not only sent invitations to many countries and media outlets in advance but also had their foreign envoys publicly announce the details of their "complete withdrawal" abroad, including the number of troops, schedule, and routes. However, apart from some unofficial representatives and reporters, Vietnam's "goodwill" was rejected by the vast majority of countries. Even those unofficial representatives and reporters mostly went with a skeptical attitude. The leader of the Thai parliamentary delegation, Xie Yi, said, "This time, we are going to observe Vietnam's withdrawal not only with our eyes and ears but, more importantly, with our minds. The purpose is to observe whether Vietnam's words match its actions."

The international community's rejection and skepticism towards Vietnam's alleged "complete withdrawal" are mainly due to the lack of effective international supervision over Vietnam's withdrawal. Before this "complete withdrawal," Vietnam had conducted eight "partial withdrawals" without international supervision. Each time, it was merely a rotation of troops. Therefore, the international community has long demanded that Vietnam accept effective international supervision of its complete withdrawal. In particular, at last month's Paris International Conference, the majority of participants advocated for the United Nations to organize an international supervision body to go to Cambodia to supervise, but this was rejected by Vietnam. Vietnam, on the one hand, claims that this is a "true and complete withdrawal," and on the other hand, avoids effective international supervision. People naturally have reason to suspect that it is repeating old tricks and creating a new withdrawal deception.

There is now sufficient evidence to prove that Vietnam's "complete withdrawal" is a carefully arranged ploy of withdrawing in public but remaining in secret. At the same time as Vietnam first announced its "complete withdrawal," it began implementing its plan to hide troops in Cambodia. For example, it first trained its elite troops in the Khmer language and Khmer customs, then had them change into fake military uniforms and join the fake military; or they would take off their uniforms and become Khmer fake militia, and some became armed Vietnamese immigrants. The United Front Government of Democratic Kampuchea recently issued a statement saying that at least 100,000 such hidden Vietnamese troops remain. Even before Vietnam's "complete withdrawal" and during the "withdrawal" period, there were continuous reports of Vietnam sending reinforcements to Cambodia, exposing that thousands of Vietnamese troops in fake military uniforms were sent to various parts of Cambodia, especially the western region, to assist the Khmer Rouge regime's troops in fighting against the Khmer resistance forces. Vietnam's actions make it impossible to believe that this withdrawal is a "true and complete withdrawal."

Moreover, from the number of troops Vietnam announced for withdrawal, there are also significant loopholes. Vietnam's withdrawal of 26,000 troops this time, plus the 24,000 it announced had been withdrawn in the previous period, totals only 50,000. However, according to the Khmer resistance forces, the current number of regular Vietnamese troops in Cambodia is 108,000. Sihanouk recently told the media that the current number of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia is not 50,000 but more than 100,000. Some Western intelligence agencies have made similar estimates. This means that even if Vietnam completes this "final withdrawal," a large number of regular troops will still remain in Cambodia. How can it be said that Vietnam has truly completely withdrawn from Cambodia?

Vietnam is once again playing the "withdrawal" deception, aiming to achieve three goals: First, to show the world that it is no longer an aggressor in Cambodia and that it has nothing to do with the Cambodian issue; second, to use the "complete withdrawal" as an excuse to stop international support and aid for the Khmer resistance forces; third, to legitimize the "Phnom Penh regime." However, Vietnam has miscalculated. Because the international community believes that a significant number of Vietnamese military forces remain in Cambodia, the nature of the Cambodian conflict as one of aggression and anti-aggression has not changed. The Cambodian people have the right to continue their struggle against Vietnamese aggression, and the international community also has the right to continue supporting this just struggle of the Cambodian people.

### 又一次骗局——评越南的所谓“全部撤军”

    又一次骗局
    ——评越南的所谓“全部撤军”
    本报记者　刘爱成
    越南当局宣称，它的数额为2.6万人的“最后一批军队”于9月26日撤出了柬埔寨。在越南看来，它在柬埔寨不再有一兵一卒了；而国际社会却普遍对此表示怀疑。
    自1982年以来，越南“撤军”这出戏已经演了多次。这一次，越南当局为了要证明此举不同寻常，除了早早就向许多国家及舆论界发出了邀请，还让其驻外使节在国外详细公布其“全部撤军”的情况，包括人数、日程和路线等。但除了一些非官方性代表和记者外，越南的“好意”遭到了绝大多数国家的拒绝。就是那些非官方性的代表和记者，多数也是抱着怀疑的态度去的。泰国议员团团长沙抑说，“我们这次去观察越南撤军，不仅要用眼睛、耳朵，更重要的是要用脑子。目的是要观察越南是否言行一致。”
    人们拒绝承认和怀疑越南的所谓“全部撤军”，主要是因为越南
  “撤军”没有国际机构的有效监督。在这次“全部撤军”以前，越南在无国际监督的情况下，曾进行过8次“部分撤军”。但每次都不过是换防而已。所以国际社会早就要求越南接受对其全部撤军进行有效的国际监督。尤其是在上月召开的巴黎国际会议上，大多数与会者主张由联合国组织国际监督机构赴柬监督，但遭到越南拒绝。越南一面声称这次是“真正的全部的撤军”，一面又逃避有效的国际监督。人们当然有理由怀疑它故伎重演，制造一次新的撤军骗局。
    现在已有足够的事实证明，越南的“全部撤军”不过是一次精心安排的明撤暗留。越南在第一次宣布“全部撤军”的同时，就已经开始实施它藏兵于柬的计划了。例如，它先对其精锐部队进行柬语及柬风俗习惯训练，继而为他们换上伪军军装，编入伪军；或者脱下军装，变为柬伪武装民兵，也有的变成武装的越南移民。民柬联合政府最近发表的一项声明说，此种潜伏下来的越军至少有10万人。直至越南“全部撤军”前夕，甚至在“撤军”期间，仍不断传来越南向柬增兵的消息，揭露有数以千计的越军穿着伪军军装，被增派到柬埔寨各地，尤其是柬西部地区，协助韩桑林政权部队与柬民族抵抗力量部队作战。越南的这些所作所为，无法让人相信它此次撤军会是“真正全部撤军”。
    此外，从越南宣布的撤军人数看，也漏洞很大。越南此次撤军2.6万人，加上它公布的在此之前一段时间撤出的2.4万人，总共才5万人。而据柬抵抗力量宣布，越目前在柬的正规部队是10.8万人。西哈努克不久前向新闻界说，目前在柬越军不是5万人，而是10万人以上。一些西方的情报机构也作了相似的估计。这就是说，越南即使完成这次“最后撤军”，仍有大批正规部队留在柬埔寨，这怎么能说越南已真正从柬埔寨全部撤军了呢？
    越南再次玩弄“撤军”骗局，无非是想达到三个目的：一是向世界表明它已不再是柬埔寨的侵略者了，它与柬问题从此无关；二是以“全部撤军”为由阻止国际上对柬民族抵抗力量的支持和援助；三是要使“金边政权”合法化。然而，越南打错了算盘。由于国际社会认为仍有相当数量的越南军事力量留在柬埔寨，柬埔寨冲突的侵略与反侵略性质没有改变，柬埔寨人民有理由把抗击越南侵略的斗争继续进行下去，国际社会也有理由继续支援柬埔寨人民的这一正义斗争。
