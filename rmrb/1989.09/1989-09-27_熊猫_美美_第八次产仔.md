Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 26th. (Reporter Wu Zuzheng) The giant panda "Meimei" at the Chengdu Zoo gave birth again in the early hours of the 24th.

The 15-year-old female giant panda "Meimei" has given birth to seven litters totaling nine cubs since 1980 under artificial breeding conditions, with six surviving. The latest birth is her eighth litter. "Meimei"'s "daughter," the female giant panda "Jinjin," gave birth to a pair of twins three days ago. Now, "Meimei" and her family are a "three-generation" family, making her a deserving "panda grandmother." This is a rare occurrence in the history of artificial breeding of giant pandas.

    熊猫“美美”第八次产仔
    新华社成都九月二十六日电　（记者吴祖政）成都动物园的大熊猫“美美”，二十四日凌晨再次产仔。
    今年十五岁的雌性大熊猫“美美”，自一九八○年以来，在人工饲养条件下，已产七胎九仔，存活六只，现在生育的是第八胎。“美美”的“女儿”——雌性大熊猫“锦锦”，三天前产下一对双胞胎。从此，“美美”一家已是“三世同堂”的家族了，它也成为当之无愧的“熊猫婆婆”，这在人工繁殖大熊猫史上实属罕见。
