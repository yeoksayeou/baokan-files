Since the nationwide professional and technical position evaluation and appointment work began in 1987, the total number of various professional and technical personnel in China has reached 20.54 million.

Among these professional and technical personnel, the number of female cadres, ethnic minority cadres, and cadres from democratic parties has significantly increased compared to the past. Among the 8.795 million female cadres nationwide, 7.16 million are engaged in professional and technical work, accounting for 81.4% of the total number of female cadres. Among ethnic minority cadres, 64.6% are engaged in professional and technical work. Among cadres from democratic parties, 85% are engaged in professional and technical work.

The number of high and intermediate level professional and technical personnel nationwide has exceeded 4.95 million. Among the 2.97 million high and intermediate level professional and technical positions evaluated and appointed in 1988, 87.8% are distributed in engineering, teaching, medical, and economic professional and technical positions. The proportion of high and intermediate level professional and technical personnel who are teachers saw the highest growth last year.

One notable feature of the expansion of the high and intermediate level professional and technical personnel team is the trend towards a younger age structure. The proportion of high and intermediate level professional and technical personnel under the age of 45 has increased from 22.2% in 1987 to 35.9% in 1988.
