	The Stick Dance — "Black and Bright"
	Zhang Hongkui

	Not long ago, at the opening ceremony of the second China Art Festival — Swan's Voice in Harbin, accompanied by the lively sound of suona horns, 24 rural youths holding flower sticks, formed four lines of dragon lantern dance teams, and rushed onto the spacious and beautiful collective dance competition venue with great vigor and spirit. They performed with great enthusiasm, sometimes expanding and contracting, sometimes fast and slow, handkerchiefs fluttering like butterflies and swallows, with innovative moves. The golden sticks spun up and down, weaving in and out, fast dances like thunder and lightning, rivers flowing straight down, slow movements like flowing water, gentle as a spring breeze. After the performance, applause erupted, and all 5,000 spectators in the venue were delighted and inspired. Someone at the stage entrance shouted, "Suihua Region is black and bright!"

	Who would have thought that the performers of such a wonderful performance were an amateur dance troupe organized by workers and farmers, and their 8-minute performance was the result of 10 years of hard work.

	The Stick Dance, also known as the Conqueror's Whip, is said to have originated in the Three Kingdoms period. It began to be recorded in the Jin Dynasty and was brought to Heilongjiang by immigrants at the end of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was only a means for artists to make a living. It was not until 1939 in Yan'an that it was truly performed on stage. In 1945, Wang Zhen's troops entered Northeast China and performed the Stick Dance in Suihua City with over a hundred soldiers celebrating liberation. However, due to various reasons, the Stick Dance has been on the verge of extinction in recent years.

	A few enthusiastic young people from the Suihua Regional Cultural Center decided to revive this beloved Stick Dance. Over the past ten years, their footsteps have been everywhere. They visited all 12 counties and over a hundred villages in the region, interviewed hundreds of folk dragon lantern artists, and after repeated revisions and arrangements, finally brought the Stick Dance back to life.

	In addition to inheriting the traditional techniques of the Stick Dance, they creatively incorporated elements such as "humor, teasing, elegance, playfulness, swaying, and twisting" from Northeast regional opera, as well as handkerchiefs from the dragon lantern dance, making the Stick Dance more colorful. Whenever the music starts, they twist to the east and strike to the west, bumping in the front and kicking in the back, as if freely roaming in the boundless wilderness. They win people's hearts with their unique ruggedness, boldness, explosiveness, and fervor. In 1985, at the second provincial dance competition, they outshone all others and won the first-class directing award, causing a sensation in the provincial capital. In 1986, they participated in the national amateur dance competition and won the "Harvest Award." In 1987, they performed in Hong Kong with the Heilongjiang Provincial Art Troupe. In 1989, at the second China Art Festival — Swan's Voice, they again won the Excellent Program Award and the Excellent Performance Award.

	The Stick Dance has truly become "black and bright."

    花棍舞——“黑又亮”
    张洪奎
    前不久，在哈尔滨第二届中国艺术节——天鹅之声开幕式上，伴随着欢快的唢呐声，24个乡下娃手持花棍、排成四路秧歌队，风风火火、虎虎灵灵地冲进宽敞、漂亮的集体舞比赛场。只见他们时而大展大收，时而快慢交之，手帕如蝶飞燕舞，花样翻新，金棍则上下飞旋，内外穿梭，快舞如雷轰电闪，江河直下，慢打似流水孱孱，春风拂面。表演结束，掌声四起，全场5000名观众无不为之喜悦振奋，还有人在台口喊了一句：“绥化地区是黑又亮”！
    谁能想到，进行如此精彩表演的原来是一支由工人、农民等组织起来的业余舞蹈队，8分钟的表演凝聚着他们10年的心血。
      “花棍舞”又名霸王鞭，据说起源于三国，在金代开始有记载，于清朝末年，由移民带到黑龙江，但那时仅是艺人们谋生的手段，真正搬上舞台是1939年在延安。1945年，王震部队进驻东北，在绥化市内曾有上百名官兵齐打花棍，欢庆解放。但由于种种原因，近年来，花棍却濒于失传。
    绥化地区文化馆几个热心的年轻人，下决心要把这深为群众喜爱的“花棍”重新挖掘出来。十年来，到处留有他们的足迹。他们走遍全区12个县，上百个村庄，走访了数百名民间秧歌艺人，又几经加工、整理，终于使花棍舞再展风姿。
    他们除继承了花棍舞的传统技法外，又创造性地揉进了东北地方戏中的“哏、逗、俏、浪、摆、扭”及秧歌中的手绢等，使花棍舞更加多姿多彩。每当音乐一响，他们东一扭，西一打，前碰碰，后踢踢，就如自由驰骋在无边的原野上一样，他们以特有的粗犷、豪放、火爆、炽烈而赢得了人们的喜爱。1985年在全省第二届舞蹈比赛中，压倒群芳，夺得编导一等奖，轰动省城。1986年参加全国业余舞蹈比赛喜获“丰收奖”，1987年随黑龙江省艺术团去香港演出，1989年，在第二届中国艺术节——天鹅之声中又获优秀节目奖，优秀表演奖。
    花棍舞成了名符其实的“黑又亮”。
