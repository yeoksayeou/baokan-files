The Japanese postal service has launched a "Little Mail Packages from Hometown" service to cater to people's longing for their hometowns. As expected, this service has been widely welcomed by the entire Japanese population.

The initiators of this service have cleverly tapped into people's nostalgia for their hometowns and their desire to obtain local specialties. They have compiled catalogs featuring various local, fresh, famous, and specialty products from different regions. These catalogs use vivid images and text to introduce local customs, traditions, and specialty products, and clearly list the types and prices of the products. Additionally, they thoughtfully include postcards for ordering, allowing customers to fill in their names, addresses, product names, and quantities needed, and send them via mail. Within a few days, a carefully packaged "Little Mail Package from Hometown" will be delivered to the customer's doorstep.

　　故乡小邮包
      “美不美，乡中水；亲不亲，故乡人。”人同此心，心同此情。日本邮政部门迎合人们的思乡之情，近年来开办了“故乡小邮包”的服务项目，正如预期的那样，受到了全日本国民的普遍欢迎。
    这项服务的倡导者利用人们思念故土，希望得到家乡特产的心理，把各地土、鲜、名、特产品编印成一个个小册子。用图文并茂的形式，向人们介绍各地风土人情及土特产品，并标明物产的品种，价格，末了还独运匠心地附了邮购用的明信片，订购者只要填上自己姓名、住址、产品名及所需数量，付邮寄出，不几日，一个精巧的“故乡小邮包”就会送到订购者的手中。　柯敏
