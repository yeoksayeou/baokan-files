The National Day is approaching. One day, my children gathered around the table, spinning the globe to find the place where the five-star red flag is raised. I stood by, gazing at it for a long time, deep in thought...

Oh, my motherland, counting from the year I joined the revolution, I have followed you for a full 40 years. 40 springs, summers, autumns, and winters, 40 cycles of flowers blooming and falling. Wrinkles have crept onto my forehead, but my deep affection for you remains unchanged, not the slightest bit less.

I joined the People's Liberation Army in the year the People's Republic was founded. Not long after the outbreak of the Korean War, I was sent to Korea. I was only eighteen then. In the icy cold and under the rain of bullets, we spilled our blood on the battlefield, risking our lives without hesitation. Our love for the Republic turned into a fierce hatred for the enemy. How many comrades left their blood and lives on foreign soil! Every time I think of my motherland, I think of those years of war and fire. This is our own Republic; how could I not love her, how could I not give everything for her!

I can be considered an old political worker. Starting in 1953, I began doing political work. In the army, I was awarded three times for meritorious service, and five times named a "Five-Good Officer" and an advanced worker. In 1976, I was transferred to the Rubber Factory of the Yueyang Petrochemical General Plant in Hunan Province, continuing my old profession. I have been named an outstanding Communist Party member and advanced worker ten times, and for four consecutive years, I was named a labor model for the sub-factory and the general plant. I was also awarded the title of "Outstanding Political Worker" and labor model by the Hunan Province Petrochemical System and the China Petrochemical Corporation. The more I do this political work, the more enthusiastic I become.

Someone said, "Doing anything else is a profession; doing political work, what's that?" I don't agree. People need to have an ideal. A team without ideals is a loose sand. The waves of reform are sweeping across the entire China, and they are also sweeping over us. Only by uniting millions of people with revolutionary ideals and moving towards the same goal can we make our great motherland head towards a more beautiful and prosperous future. As a political worker, the more I do, the more I feel the sky is vast, and there is so much to do!

After becoming the director of the propaganda department, I once gave a report on the "Three Loves" (love for the Party, love for the country, love for socialism) at a training class for young workers. After the meeting, a few young people surrounded me, saying that I spoke too broadly, too far, too vaguely. They said: "We also have a 'Three Loves,' which is to love wife, love children, love money, this is practical." I heard this and laughed, saying to them: "Loving wife and children is not wrong, it is human nature, but have you thought about why in the old society, and during the days when the 'Gang of Four' was rampant, why many people wanted to love but couldn't? We must distinguish between the 'big Three Loves' and your 'small Three Loves.' Without the Party, without a socialist country, where would your 'small Three Loves' come from?" One young man was not convinced, saying that the big and small should be added together to make a "Six Loves." I said, this has a sequence, a main and a secondary, it can't be added like that, and repeatedly patiently explained the reason. After the training, these young people finally agreed, saying that they should use the "big Three Loves" spoken by the old director to control their "small Three Loves."

Later, whenever these young people saw me, they would often smile and first stretch out three fingers, then six fingers, and finally three fingers again. I saw this and understood, it was about that "incident," and my heart was filled with joy. Who says political work is boring!

Looking back at these more than ten years, every year I write more than a hundred articles, and every year more than ten articles are published in newspapers, radio, and broadcasting stations. Sometimes during the day, I go to the workshop to investigate, and at night, I lie in bed to draft, and as soon as it's dawn, I rush to the office to write. I work with great interest. Why? Because I love, I love the motherland that gave birth to me and raised me. I want to use my work to tell more people that China is mine, and it is also yours. This is me, an "old political worker," my love and joy.

### “老政工”的爱与乐

　　“老政工”的爱与乐
　　岳阳石化总厂　钟征远
    国庆节快到了。一天，孩子们围在桌旁转动地球仪，找到升起五星红旗的那块地方。我伫立一旁，久久地注视着，久久地深思着……
    哦，祖国，打从参加革命那年算起，我跟着你已经走过整整40个年头了。40个春夏秋冬，40次花开花落，皱纹爬上了我的额头，而对你的深深的挚爱，却一如当年，分毫不减。
    我是在共和国诞生那年加入中国人民解放军的，抗美援朝战争爆发不久，就到了朝鲜。那年才十八岁。在冰天雪地里，在枪林弹雨中，热血洒疆场，生命置度外，我们对共和国的爱，化成了奋勇杀敌的仇恨。有多少战友把热血和生命留在了异国他乡！每当我想起祖国，我就会想起那个战火纷飞的年代。这是我们自己的共和国，我怎能不爱她，不为她奉献一切！
    我算得上一个老政工了。从1953年开始做政治工作，在部队里就曾3次立功，5次被评为“五好军官”和先进工作者；1976年转业到湖南岳阳石化总厂橡胶厂仍干老本行，10次被评为优秀共产党员和先进工作者，连续四年被评为分厂和总厂的劳动模范，还获得了湖南省石化系统和中国石油化工总公司授予的“优秀政治工作者”和劳动模范的光荣称号。政工这一行，我越干越来劲。
    有人说：“干别的，是个专业；干政工，算个啥呀？”我不服气。人活着得有个理想，没理想的队伍是一盘散沙。改革的浪潮冲击着整个中国，也冲击着我们，只有用革命的理想凝聚起千百万人的力量，向着同一个目标迈进，才能使伟大祖国走向更美好、更富强的明天。作为一个政工干部，越干我越觉得天地广阔，有干不完的事哩！
    我当了厂宣传科长后，一次在青工轮训班上作“三热爱”（爱党，爱国，爱社会主义）报告。几个小青年会后把我围上了，说我讲得太大、太远、太空。他们说：我们也有个“三热爱”，叫“爱老婆、爱孩子、爱钱”，这才实惠呢。我听了呵呵一笑，对他们说：“爱老婆、孩子没有错，是人之常情，但你们想过没有，在旧社会，在‘四人帮’横行的日子里，为什么许多人想爱而爱不成呢？我们要把‘大三热爱’和你们那‘小三热爱’分清楚。没有党，没有社会主义国家，哪来你们的‘小三热爱’呢？”有个青年不服气，说要把大的小的加起来，搞“六热爱”。我说，这可是有先有后、有主有次，不能这么加，并反复耐心地讲道理。经过轮训，这些青年们到底服了，说还是要用老科长讲的“大三热爱”管住自己的“小三热爱”。
    以后这帮小青年见到我，常常笑嘻嘻地先伸三个指头，再伸六个指头，最后又伸三个指头，我一看就明白，指的是那个“典故”，于是心里一阵欢愉。谁说政治工作没味道呀！
    想想我这10多年，每年都要写上百篇稿件，每年都有十几篇稿件在报刊、电台、广播站发表，有时白天下车间搞调查，晚上躺在床上打腹稿，天一亮就跑到办公室写起来。干得有滋有味。为啥？就因为我爱，我爱生我、养我的祖国。我要通过我的工作，告诉更多的人，中国是我的，也是你的。这就是我，一个“老政工”的爱与乐。
