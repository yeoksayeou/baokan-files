	Managing the Triangle Area
	By Yuán Jiàndá, People's Daily Reporter

	The Triangle Area, officially known as the Beijing Chongwenmen East Shuncheng Street West Triangle Area, covers 80 square meters. From April to July this year, this tiny patch of land attracted over 500 job seekers from outside Beijing daily, witnessing both tragedies and farces. However, in a short period, due to the joint efforts of the military, government, and police in the capital, the Triangle Area was quickly brought under control.

	Alarm

	Before March this year, the Triangle Area was an obscure urban plot. At that time, thousands of job seekers from outside Beijing would come out of Beijing Railway Station and head straight to the underpass of Jianguomen Interchange, waiting for employers to select them.

	In March, the Dongcheng District Government of Beijing organized personnel from the Public Security, Industry and Commerce, Labor, Urban Management, and Law Enforcement teams to shut down the illegal labor market at Jianguomen and to guard and propagate the area day and night.

	However, within a month, the influx of migrant workers chose the alleyway near the Beijing Women's Federation Service Company as their new gathering spot. The number of people quickly grew from a few dozen to over five hundred. However, their job-seeking activities were illegal and unprotected by law, and they were subject to penalties. The most dangerous aspect was that some criminals had their eyes on the Triangle Area, targeting young women with good appearances, deceiving them into traps.

	The Triangle Area had seen the shadows of gangsters. Several men in their fifties and sixties, under the guise of helping to find jobs, lured young women from outside Beijing to secluded places and committed crimes.

	Con artists selling fake medicines and fake silver coins also frequently visited the Triangle Area. They cheated people and made illicit money. Among them were some individual business owners who ignored government notices and drove to the Triangle Area to hire workers. Residents living nearby and those who had witnessed the situation in the Triangle Area were outraged. They wrote letters to the government and police, demanding immediate closure of the area.

	Action

	In July, the Dongcheng District Jianguomen Street Comprehensive Management Office received orders from higher authorities and quickly organized public security officers to clear the Triangle Area. The soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were on standby in the capital, heard the news and proactively sent several hundred soldiers led by Political Commissar Wu Yueting and Chief of Staff Wang Tingxuan to assist in the clearance. Their disciplined and swift actions set an example for local law enforcement personnel.

	After the law enforcement officers surrounded the Triangle Area, they brought the hundreds of job seekers from outside Beijing to the courtyard of the Beijing Women's Federation Service Company for examination and education. Most of these people were quickly released, and some immediately expressed their intention to return home. However, a few criminals mixed in the crowd were exposed. A woman surnamed Bai confessed under the pressure of the law to her illegal activities involving multiple people. A man in his fifties who claimed to be a reporter from a certain newspaper was also caught engaging in shameful activities. A man named Kelimu from Xinjiang was arrested for selling counterfeit goods.

	From July 23 to August 24, the military, government, and police in the capital conducted eight joint clearances of the Triangle Area, examining over 2,000 people, and legally detaining 16 of them. They also seized a batch of weapons, reactionary leaflets, obscene materials, fake silver coins, and fake rings. A gang that had long been operating in the illegal labor market, kidnapping women and engaging in shameful activities, was also dismantled.

	After the illegal labor market in the Triangle Area was shut down, the law enforcement officers did not rest on their laurels. They learned from the lessons of the past few years, where illegal labor markets were repeatedly shut down but quickly reopened. They erected prominent signs in the Triangle Area, publicizing the regulations against illegal hiring.

	Law Enforcement Team

	The Jianguomen Area Social Order Law Enforcement Team was the vanguard in the battle to manage the Triangle Area.

	The eleven members of the law enforcement team came from the municipal and district public security departments and government security departments in Beijing. They all had high policy awareness and professional skills. Before and after the management of the Triangle Area, they used their rich legal knowledge and skilled investigative methods to gather a large amount of evidence of criminal activities, providing a guarantee for the accurate and powerful strike against criminal activities.

	In early April, when the illegal labor market in the Triangle Area was just forming, the law enforcement officers Su Jingping and Yan Yucheng, who were on external duty, discovered the activities of the criminal Sun. Su Jingping and Yan Yucheng gathered evidence of the old man's involvement with a young woman. After multiple investigations, it was confirmed that the old man was a member of a gang. In mid-August, Sun was caught in the Triangle Area.

	In the law enforcement team, the young and capable team leaders Zhang Lin and He Haishi led by example. They and the team members ate cold bread and drank cold water, fought continuously day and night, studied the situation, formulated plans, and examined suspects. He Haishi's wife is a tram conductor, and the busier the holidays, the less they see each other.

	The commander of the law enforcement team is Zheng Zichun, the deputy director of the Jianguomen Street Office. This "old public security officer," who has worked in public security for 40 years and once served as the deputy director of the Dongcheng District Public Security Bureau, said deeply: "For the peace and happiness of the people of the capital, what do we public security officers have to give up?"

    治理三角地
    本报记者　袁建达
    三角地，全名北京崇文门东顺城街西口三角地，面积80平方米。今年4月至7月，这块名副其实的弹丸之地每天都聚集500多名外地求职者，演出了一幕幕悲剧和丑剧。但在很短时间内，由于首都军、政、警联合行动，三角地很快得到了治理。
          警　报
    今年3月以前，三角地还是一块不为人知的城市空地。那时，成百上千的外地求职者从北京站出来，便直奔建国门立交桥下，等待雇主选用。
    今年3月，北京东城区政府组织公安、工商、劳动、市容、执法队等部门人员，取缔了建国门非法劳务市场，并日夜派人看守、宣传。
    谁知，不到一个月，源源而来的外地民工便选中了北京三八家庭服务总公司所在地的胡同口三角地，人数由最初的几十人迅速增加到五六百人。但是，他们的求职属于“私招乱雇”，不仅不应得到法律保护，而且还要受罚。最危险的是，一些犯罪分子始终盯着三角地，他们把面容较好的女孩子当作自己的猎物，瞅准机会，骗其上当。
    三角地出现过流氓团伙的鬼影。几个五六十岁的老头，以帮助介绍工作为名，把外地女青年骗至僻静处，实施犯罪。
    卖假药、卖假银元的江湖骗子也频频光临三角地。他们坑骗他人，赚取昧心钱。这当中也有一些不听劝阻、无视政府公告的个体业主开着车到三角地雇人。居住在附近的市民和耳闻目睹三角地内情的人们愤怒了，他们纷纷写信给政府和警方，要求尽快取缔。
                  行动
    7月，酷热东城区建国门街道综合治理办公室接到上级指令后，迅速组织公安干警对三角地开始清理。在首都执行戒严任务的解放军某部听到消息，主动派出以政委武跃庭、参谋长王廷选为首的几百名官兵协助清场。他们军容严整、纪律严明、行动迅速、准确，给地方执法人员树立了榜样。
    执法人员包围三角地后，将滞留在那里的几百名外地求职者带到三八服务总公司大院内，逐一审查，耐心教育。这些人中的大多数，很快被放出去，有的当即表示回老家去。混杂在人群中的少数不法分子却露出了马脚。一个姓白的女人在威严的法律威慑下，供出自己与多人乱搞，非法获利的罪行；一名自称是某报记者的五十来岁男人在此做见不得人的勾当，也落入法网；一个名叫克里木的新疆人在此兜售的伪劣商品，被依法收审。
    从7月23日到8月24日，首都军、政、警三方8次联合清理三角地，审查了2000多人，依法收审了其中的16名，清查出一批凶器、反动传单、淫秽物品、假银元、假戒指等。一个长期在非法劳务市场拐骗妇女、进行无耻活动的流氓团伙也被破获。
    三角地非法劳务市场被取缔后，执法人员并没有偃旗息鼓。他们吸取几年来非法劳务市场屡禁不止、散而复聚的教训，在三角地树起了醒目的标语牌，把严禁私招乱雇的法规公之于世。
              执　法　队
    建国门地区社会治安执法队便是在这场硬仗中冲锋陷阵的尖兵。
    执法队的十一名成员来自北京市、区公安部门和政府的保卫部门，他们都有较高的政策水平和业务能力。在整治三角地前后，他们运用丰富的法律知识和娴熟的侦破手段，掌握了犯罪分子的大量作案证据，为准确、有力地打击犯罪活动提供了保证。
    4月初，当三角地非法劳务市场刚刚形成时，担任外勤任务的执法队员宿京平、阎玉成就发现了犯罪分子孙某的行动。宿京平和阎玉成掌握了孙老头与一女青年勾搭的证据。经过多次侦察，证实那老头是一流氓团伙的成员。8月中旬，孙某在三角地落入法网。
    在执法队，年轻、干练的队长张林、何海石身先士卒。他们和队员们一起啃冷饼子、喝凉水，连续作战，没日没夜地研究情况，制定方案，审查嫌疑分子。何海石的妻子是电车售票员，越是节假日越忙，夫妻难得见面。
    执法队的指挥官是建国门街道办事处副主任郑子春。这位干了40年公安工作，曾任北京东城公安分局副局长的“老公安”，他深沉地说：“为了首都人民的安宁、幸福，我们干公安的还有什么舍不得的呢？”
