“Value” is one of the categories that reveal the essential relationship between subjects and objects. All human activities, to varying degrees, involve value issues. If we remove the aspect of value significance from practical and cognitive activities, they are at best a collection of physical actions and processes. In recent years, the theoretical community in China has paid widespread attention to the problem of value, reflecting the urgent need for people to deeply reflect on the meaning of their own existence and development. Therefore, the publication of the book *Philosophy of Value* (by Wáng Yùliáng, published by Shaanxi People's Publishing House) deserves attention.

Firstly, it further clarifies the disciplinary status of the philosophy of value. There have always been different views on the disciplinary status of value theory and its relationship with traditional philosophical sub-disciplines. Therefore, clarifying the attribution of the value category is one of the foundational tasks for advancing the study of value theory. The author examines the reasonable and insufficient aspects of various views in the book and proposes his own perspective. He believes that although the value category can also become an important category in epistemology and historical views, and it is not ruled out to study value problems from an ontological perspective, traditional sub-disciplines each have their specific research objects and characteristics, and cannot comprehensively encompass the value relationships between subjects and objects. In Marxist philosophy, value theory should be an independent discipline, guided by materialism and dialectics, alongside epistemology, natural philosophy, and historical views. If the value category is merely attributed to epistemology or historical views, it will limit the study of value problems to a narrow scope, which is an important reason why the study of value theory has not been deepened. To clearly reveal the philosophical nature of this discipline and avoid confusing it with other disciplines (such as the value theory in economics and the value concept in ethics), the author believes that "value theory," which studies general value problems from a philosophical height, can be called "philosophy of value." Compared to other terms, the category of "philosophy of value" can better reveal the object, nature, and characteristics of this discipline.

Secondly, the principle of subjectivity is upheld throughout the research. The problem of value has a strong subjectivity, and the principle of subjectivity is an important principle running through the entire book. The principle of subjectivity is not subjectivism but rather places the focus of examining value problems on the subject. In the author's view, the problem of value is a specific relationship between subjects and objects. To understand the essence of value, one must deeply understand the subjects, objects, and their relationships. Pure objectivism cannot explain the innovativeness and multiplicity of value; pure subjectivism cannot explain the constancy of value. On the premise of affirming the objectivity of value, the author emphasizes the exploration of the subjectivity of value, which is reflected in the chapters on the essence, structure, function, and basis of value. The author believes that in the value relationship between subjects and objects, the value subject plays a dominant, guiding, and controlling role. The standard and measure of the value of an object is not the object itself but the needs of the subject; most value objects are products of labor, created by the value activities of the subject, reflecting the subject's initiative and creativity. The difference between a value object and a general object lies in its transcendence of reality, that is, it is always superior to existing things. This superiority embodies the subject's progressiveness; superiority is essentially an innovation, originating from the subject's creativity; value embodies the subject's ideals and aspirations, and thus has a forward-looking nature. From this, it can be seen that the subject and object, as structural factors of the existence of value phenomena, do not have equal roles; the subject obviously has more significant meaning.

Thirdly, the author strives to combine theoretical issues with practical problems, deepening the research on the theme. The problem of value has strong practicality, and under the current conditions of reform and opening up, the problem of value has become a prominent issue of the times. The author believes that the study of value problems should not be limited to conceptual levels but should face the vibrant reality of life and strive to answer some important questions raised by reform practices. To this end, the book emphasizes the issue of reform and values, and conducts a special discussion on the essence and function of value concepts, as well as the mechanism of value concept changes. Value concepts are the unity of value pursuit and value standards. Value standards are determined by value pursuit, and value pursuit is determined by people's needs and interests, which are the internalization of the subject's needs and interests, and the result of the interaction and coordination between social needs, social interests, and individual needs and interests. Value concepts, with value pursuit as the core, value standards as the main expression, and a rational conceptual model as the main component, also include some irrational factors. The author uses the changes in value concepts brought about by the household contract responsibility system as an example to discuss the mechanism of value concept changes and provides constructive discussions on the driving forces, internal and external conditions of value concept changes in China's current stage.

    对价值问题的新探索
    ——《价值哲学》读后
    李景源
    “价值”是揭示主客体本质关系的范畴之一，人们的一切活动都程度不同地包含着价值问题。如果从实践和认识活动中抽去了价值意义的方面，它们充其量不过是一堆物理动作和过程。近年来，国内理论界对价值问题的普遍关注，反映了人们对自身存在和发展意义进行深刻反思的迫切要求。因此，《价值哲学》（王玉梁著，陕西人民出版社出版）一书的问世，理应受到人们的重视。
    第一，进一步明确了价值哲学的学科地位。关于价值论的学科地位以及它与哲学传统分支学科的关系问题，始终存在着不同的观点。因此，弄清价值范畴的归属，是推进价值论研究的基础工作之一。作者在书中分别考察了各种看法的合理之处及其不足，并就此提出了自己的观点。他认为，尽管价值范畴也可以成为认识论和历史观的重要范畴，甚至不排斥从本体论角度去研究价值问题，但传统的分支学科都有其专门的研究对象和自身的特点，不可能将主客体之间的价值关系包罗无遗。在马克思主义哲学中，价值论应是在唯物论、辩证法指导下，与认识论、自然观和历史观并列的、相对独立的学科。如果把价值范畴仅仅归属为认识论或历史观之内，就会把价值问题的研究限定在一个狭小的范围内，这正是目前价值论研究不能深入的重要原因。为了明确揭示这一学科的哲学性质，不致于使它混同于其它学科（如经济学中的价值理论和伦理学中的价值概念），作者认为：作为从哲学高度研究一般价值问题的“价值论”，可以称之为“价值哲学”。相比较而言，“价值哲学”这一范畴更能揭示这一学科的对象、性质和特点。
    第二，在研究中贯彻了主体性原则。价值问题有很强的主体性，主体性原则是贯穿全书的一个重要原则。主体性原则并不是唯主体论，而是把考察价值问题的重心放在主体方面。在作者看来，价值问题是主客体之间的特定关系问题。要了解价值的本质，必须深入了解主客体及其关系。纯粹的客观论解释不了价值的创新性和多元性；纯粹的主观论也不能解释价值恒定性。在肯定价值有其客观性的前提下，作者侧重探讨了价值的主体性含义，这一思想体现在价值的本质、结构、功能、根据等章节中。作者认为，在主客体的价值关系中，价值主体起着主宰、主导、支配作用。客体价值的标准、尺度，不是客体自身，而是主体的需要；价值客体大多数是劳动产品，是主体价值活动的创造，表现了主体的能动性和创造性。价值物与一般客体的区别在于它是对现实的超越，即它总是比现存事物优越，这种优越体现了主体的进取性；优越本质上是一种创新，它来源于主体的创造；价值体现了主体的理想和向往，因而具有超前性。由此可见，主体和客体作为价值现象存在的结构性作用因子，其作用并不是等同的，主体显然具有更重要的意义。
    第三，作者力求把理论问题和现实问题结合起来，深化了对主题的研究。价值问题具有很强的实践性，在当前改革开放的条件下，价值问题已成为时代关注的突出问题。作者认为，对价值问题的研究，不能仅停留在概念上，而应面对沸腾的现实生活，努力回答改革实践所提出的某些重要问题。为此，本书对改革与价值观问题作了重点发挥，对价值观念的实质和功能、以及价值观念变革的机制等论题进行了专门论述。价值观念是价值追求和价值标准的统一。价值标准是由价值追求决定的，而价值追求又是由人们的需要、利益决定的，是主体需要、利益的内化，是社会需要、社会利益与个人需要、个人利益相互作用、协调的结果。价值观念是以价值追求为核心，以价值标准为主要表现，以理性观念模式为主、又包含某些非理性因素的观念系统。作者以联产承包责任制所引起的价值观念的变化为例，探讨了价值观念变革的机制，并对我国现阶段价值观念变革的动力、内在和外在的条件，作了富有建设性的论述。
