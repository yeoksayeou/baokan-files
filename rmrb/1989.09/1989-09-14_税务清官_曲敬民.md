Early this year, in the tax bureau of Longkou City, Shandong Province, a tax official who was dismissed for soliciting bribes stormed into the bureau chief's office. Pointing at Qu Jingmin, he said, "You're not going to get away with this! I want to see how clean you really are!" Qu Jingmin calmly replied, "You can investigate me if you like!" The disciplined official, despite visiting many acquaintances, found nothing wrong with Qu Jingmin. Afterwards, he sighed, "I truly admire Qu Jingmin, the bureau chief."

Some people say that the tax department is a "fat job." But Qu Jingmin says, "That depends on how you look at it. If you want to exercise power for the Party and the people, there's not only no 'grease' to be gained, but it's also a thorny path."

Four years ago, after Qu Jingmin became the bureau chief, he set three rules for his family: do not accept gifts or bribes from visitors; do not use his name to do private business; do not interfere with any matters in the bureau. In his view, keeping the family in check is an important prerequisite for clean governance. In 1987, before the Mid-Autumn Festival, a taxpayer took advantage of Qu Jingmin's absence to send sea cucumbers, dried scallops, cigarettes, and alcohol through an intermediary. Before his wife could react, the person left a note saying, "Please take care of me." When Qu Jingmin returned home and heard about the incident, he criticized his wife in front of the children. The next morning, he had the children return the items in full.

For relatives and friends, Qu Jingmin does not show favoritism. Last October, his nephew used an external account to evade taxes and was caught. The nephew begged him for leniency. Qu Jingmin not only severely criticized his nephew but also ordered the relevant personnel to strictly punish him according to the regulations. Afterwards, Qu Jingmin supported the bureau's staff in writing a news report about the incident and sending it to the local newspaper.

In the past two years, people have often hinted to Qu Jingmin, "You're already 50 years old. How many more years can you work? Don't be too serious about things." But Qu Jingmin always says, "I am a Communist Party member. How can I not be serious?"

In March of this year, a state-owned company in the city purchased a batch of color TVs and wanted to sell part of them to the company's employees. The company leader, an old acquaintance of Qu Jingmin, came to his door seeking to have the special consumption tax waived. After being refused, the other party even asked a superior leader to intervene. Qu Jingmin patiently explained the relevant regulations and policies for levying the special consumption tax to the leader, and firmly collected the tax.

Righteousness and firmness are directly proportional. For some difficult cases, Qu Jingmin always plays the role of "Judge Bao."

Since last year, he has directly handled 13 major tax evasion cases, recovering over 100 million yuan in taxes and fines.

Qu Jingmin's clean governance has been recognized by the Longkou Municipal Party Committee and Government, who have awarded him a meritorious service citation. This year, he was also promoted to a higher salary grade and was awarded the title of Outstanding Communist Party Member.

　　“税务清官”曲敬民
　　于广义　刘常安
    今年初，在山东省龙口市税务局，一位因索贿被开除的税务干部，气汹汹地闯进局长办公室，指着曲敬民说：“你处理我，没那么便宜！我倒要看看，你就那么干净？！”曲敬民坦然地说：“你可以去查嘛！”那位受处分的干部单位没少跑熟人没少问，就是没找到曲敬民一点不是。事后，他感慨地说：“对曲敬民局长，咱心服口服。”
    有人说，税务部门是块“肥缺”。但曲敬民说：“这要看怎么讲，如果要为党和人民掌好权用好权，非但没什么‘油水’可捞，反倒是个棘手的行道。”
    4年前，曲敬民任局长后，就给家人约法三章：不准收受来人的礼品、贿赂；不准打他的旗号办私事；不准插手局里的任何事情。在他看来，把好家门是廉洁从政的重要前提之一。1987年中秋节前，有位纳税户趁曲敬民外出，托人送来海参、海米、烟酒等物品，没等他老伴反应过来，那人便留下张
  “请多关照”的纸条走了。曲敬民回家听说事情的经过后，当着子女们的面批评了老伴。第二天一早，他又让孩子将东西如数退了回去。
    对亲戚、朋友，曲敬民也不讲情面。去年10月，他的一个侄子借外单位账号偷漏税被查获，央求他给予通融。曲敬民不但狠狠批评了侄子，还责成有关人员按规定从严处罚。事后，曲敬民又支持局里的干部把这件事写成新闻稿送当地报社。
    这两年，不断有人给曲敬民“吹风”：“你都是50岁的人了，还能干几年？遇事别太认真啦。”可曲敬民总是说：“我是共产党员，怎能不讲认真？”。
    今年3月，市里一家国营公司购进一批彩电，想拿出一部分卖给本单位职工。公司领导同曲敬民是老相识，便找上门去，求他把特别消费税给免了。遭拒绝后，对方又托上级领导出面说情。曲敬民耐心向领导说明征收特别消费税的有关规定和政策，硬是把这笔税款征收了。
    正气和硬气是成正比的。对一些难办的案子，曲敬民总是当“黑脸包公”。
    去年以来，他直接查处了13起偷漏税大案，补税罚款100多万元。
    曲敬民廉洁从政，龙口市委、市政府给他记了大功，今年又给他晋升一级工资，并授予他优秀共产党员光荣称号。
