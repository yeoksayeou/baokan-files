The psychological characteristics of cadres violating discipline are mainly due to internal factors, with psychological factors being a crucial internal condition. Recently, we conducted a survey of cadres who violated discipline and were dealt with in our county from 1982 to 1988. We summarized the following psychological characteristics of cadres violating discipline:

	The psychology of greed for money. Those with this mindset often start with the idea of seizing money through cunning and deceit, engaging in opportunistic behavior and being driven by greed. In their view, “reform is about making money.” Such individuals have mental preparations and plans for action before committing violations. Therefore, this psychological mindset quickly turns into disciplinary violations or even criminal behavior, with severe consequences.

	The psychology of absolute power. This refers to cadres with a certain amount of power who violate organizational principles, act unilaterally, and seek to satisfy their own will and interests. Those with this mindset follow the principle of “use it or lose it” and use any means necessary to seek personal gain through power.

	The psychology of compensation. Those with this mindset often have done a lot of beneficial work for the party and the people in the past. In recent years, under the temptation of money, especially after being despised by their families, they develop a sense of loss. These cadres feel that after decades of hard work, they end up with nothing, so they might as well take advantage of their current positions to “make as much money as possible.”

	The psychology of exchange. Such individuals often think, “I use my power to help you, so you should thank me with money.” After the exchange of power and money, these individuals use their authority to do favors for those who invite them to dine or give them gifts, opening doors of convenience.

	The psychology of imitation. Some people see that certain violators have temporarily escaped punishment, and some even gain significant political and economic benefits. They become envious and develop an imitative psychology of “if others do it, I’ll do it too,” engaging in illegal and disciplinary violations.

	The psychology of jealousy. This is manifested as envy and hatred towards others' abilities and achievements, leading to a desire to belittle or even harm others. Such individuals often use slander, framing, attacking, and retaliatory means.

    干部违纪的心理特征
    干部违纪除了社会上的客观原因外，主要取决于自身的内在因素，而心理因素又是干部违纪极为重要的内在条件。最近，我们对我县1982年至1988年已处理的违纪干部进行了调查，归纳干部违纪有以下几种心理特征：
    捞钱心理。持这种心理的人，往往以巧取豪夺金钱为出发点，投机钻营，利欲熏心。在他们看来：
  “改革就是捞钱”。这种人在违纪前，思想上就有了准备，行动上就有了打算，因此，这种违纪心理转化为违纪行为甚至犯罪行为时，速度快，后果严重。
    独权心理。即指握有一定权力的干部违背组织原则，独断专行，以实现自己意志、利益为满足的一种心理状态。持这种心理的干部，奉行“有权不用，过时作废”的信条，不择手段地以权谋私。
    补偿心理。持这种心理的人大多是过去为党为人民做过不少有益的工作，近几年在金钱的诱惑下，特别是受家属的鄙弃后，产生一种失落感。这些干部觉得辛苦几十年，落得个穷光蛋，不如趁在职机会“抓紧时间多捞点”。
    交换心理。这种人往往认为：“我用权替你办事，你就得用钱感谢我。”在权钱交换之后，这种人便利用自己掌握的权力为请吃、送礼者帮大忙，开方便之门。
    效仿心理。有的人看到一些违纪者一时逃避了制裁，有的还在政治上、经济上得到莫大的“好处”，眼便红起来，产生了“别人搞我也搞”的效仿心理，干起了违法乱纪的事情。
    嫉妒心理。表现为由于对他人的才能和成就的忌恨，而产生贬低他人甚至迫害他人的一种意识和行为。这种人常采取诬蔑、陷害、攻击、报复等手段。
