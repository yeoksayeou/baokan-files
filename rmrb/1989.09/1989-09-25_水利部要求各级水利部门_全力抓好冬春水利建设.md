	The winter agricultural water conservancy construction is about to begin. The Ministry of Water Resources has required all levels of water resources departments to focus on the winter and spring water conservancy construction this year and next spring, and to treat it as the most important and urgent task for the water resources departments at present.

	Floods, droughts, and soil erosion are the main unfavorable factors affecting China's agricultural production. In recent years, water conservancy construction in many places in China has been basically stagnant, with the original projects aging and deteriorating, and the benefits significantly reduced. In response to this situation, Vice Minister of Water Resources Hou Jie recently proposed at the national on-site meeting on water conservancy construction in rural areas in the south held in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, that the rural water conservancy construction this winter and next spring should focus on benefits, be tailored to local conditions, select the main attack direction, concentrate on transforming medium and low-yield fields, and build high-yield and stable-yield fields. In the Jianghuai River Basin and coastal areas, the focus should be on flood control, improving the flood control standards of river, lake, and sea dikes and embankments; in low-lying areas, the focus should be on drainage and waterlogging control, dredging rivers, excavating field drainage ditches, and increasing the capacity of mechanical and electrical drainage and irrigation; in arid and less rainy areas, the focus should be on developing irrigation, doing a good job in water source projects, and improving the capacity of water storage, diversion, and lifting.

    水利部要求各级水利部门
    全力抓好冬春水利建设
    据新华社南京9月24日电　（记者张银曙、孙参）冬季农田水利建设即将开始，水利部要求各级水利部门全力抓好今冬和明春水利建设，并把它当作当前水利部门最重要、最迫切的一项任务来抓。
    洪涝旱灾和水土流失是影响我国农业生产的主要不利因素。近几年我国不少地方水利建设基本处于停顿状态，原有工程老化失修，效益衰减十分严重。针对这一状况，水利部副部长侯捷近日在江苏省江都县召开的全国南方农村水利建设现场会上提出，今冬明春的农村水利建设要以效益为中心，因地制宜，选准主攻方向，集中改造中低产田，建设高产稳产田。在江湖流域和沿海地区，要以防洪为主，提高江河湖海堤防和圩区的防洪标准；在平原低洼地区，要以除涝、治渍为主，疏浚河道，开挖田间排水沟区，增加机电排灌功力；在干旱少雨地区，要以发展灌溉为主，搞好水源工程建设，提高蓄引提水能力。
