The Top Three "Little Tigers" in Weightlifting

“Success! Success!” The referee on the weightlifting platform repeatedly announced the success of the Guangxi young athletes' attempts. The audience was amazed to find that out of the 10 competitors in the 48kg final, 4 were from Guangxi. Among them, 3 performed exceptionally well, showing great courage and determination, truly like three little tigers.

First, let's talk about 18-year-old Lin Qisheng. At the start of the snatch, he lifted the 95kg barbell high above his head, and then managed 100kg. This weight is more than twice his own body weight. “Wow, this kid is really something!” the audience exclaimed. But the best was yet to come. In the clean and jerk, he started with 120kg, 5kg more than the other competitors. When others failed at 120kg, he successfully lifted 125kg. In the end, Lin Qisheng won the championship with a total score of 225kg.

Li Rongshan, who came in third, and Zhang Xiangsen, who came in fourth, were also not to be outdone. In the snatch competition, the two seemed to have coordinated their efforts, succeeding in all three attempts and both reaching and exceeding 100kg, laying a solid foundation for a good ranking. In the clean and jerk, they followed the lead of the first-place Lin Qisheng.

The coach who trained these three young athletes is the former national weightlifting champion Tang Jinbo. Tang Jinbo has three training secrets: first, insist on solid basic training; second, build confidence from a young age; third, strict management. For the sake of his career, he has not yet started a family, devoting all his time and energy to training. With such a coach, it is natural that he can cultivate excellent talents.

    杠铃前三只“小老虎”
    “成功！成功！”举重台上裁判员不断地宣布广西小将试举成功。观众惊奇地发现，参加48公斤决赛的10名选手中，有4人来自广西。而其中有3名战将。表现十分出色，敢拚敢冲真像三只小老虎。
    先说18岁的林启升，抓举一开始就把95公斤的杠铃高高举起，接着又达到100公斤。这个重量超过本身体重两倍多。“呀，这个娃娃真不简单！”观众惊呼道。然而好戏还在后头，挺举他更显出与众不同，一开头要了120公斤，比其他选手高出5公斤。当别人在120公斤的杠铃前失败时，他却挺起125公斤。最后，林启升以225公斤的总成绩夺得冠军。
    获第三名的李荣山和第四名张祥森也不甘示弱。抓举比赛两人像商量好似的，三次试举三次成功，而且都达到和超过了100公斤的成绩，为夺取好名次奠定了基础。挺举比赛，他们又跟着第一名的林启升往前冲。
    培养三员小将的教练是过去全国举重名将唐锦波。唐锦波训练有三条秘诀：一是坚持认真抓基础训练；二是从小培养自信心；三是严格管理。他为了事业，至今还未成家，把全部时间和精力放在训练上，有这样的教练自然能培养出好苗子。
