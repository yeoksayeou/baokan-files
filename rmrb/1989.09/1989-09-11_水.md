Without water, memories are parched and yellow. Nature, due to anemia, is pale. Spring is merely a forced concept, and the land will lose its love. Emotions will dry up. Thus, there will be no calls, no reproduction, no life.

With water, the climate will have a vibrant spring tide. The Yangtze River will flow through the Three Gorges legend. Columbus will wear the laurel of a navigator. The Battle of Red Cliffs will not dry up Su Dongpo's memories. The desert winds will not blow away the longing in one's heart. The naval port nights will make the singer sing deeply.

Ah, I will walk towards you—never to forget and never to lose—the blood of humanity and nature.

　　胡伟没有水，记忆是枯黄的大自然因贫血而苍白春天只是一种强加的观念而土地也将失去爱情感也将干涸于是，没有呼唤，没有繁衍，没有生命有了水，气候才有蓬勃的春潮长江才流出三峡的传奇哥伦布才戴上航海家的桂冠赤壁才无法风干苏轼的记忆戈壁滩的风沙吹不走心中的渴望军港之夜　才叫歌手深情地歌唱呵，我将走向你——不能忘却和失去的人类和大自然的血液
