A collection of Deng Xiaoping's major works from the 28 years before the "Cultural Revolution" has been compiled and published as the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." This volume, arranged chronologically, can be considered the first volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," while the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" (1975-1982) published in 1983 can be considered its second volume.

The newly published "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" is an important historical document. It begins in 1938, when the Anti-Japanese War had just started and Deng Xiaoping was serving as the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army. The collection ends in 1965, on the eve of the "Cultural Revolution," when Deng Xiaoping had been serving as the General Secretary of the Party Central Committee for 10 years. Over these 28 years, the 39 works included in the collection were selected from thousands of manuscripts and documents. In the tumultuous years of war, some works might not have been preserved, so there are gaps in certain years and important events. However, overall, this collection reflects Deng Xiaoping's contributions in theory and practice to military, political, economic, and party-building efforts during the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the first 17 years after the founding of the nation.

As a historical document, this collection provides valuable content that helps people understand the development of China's revolutionary and construction efforts during these historical periods and the principles and creative spirit of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership. As a theoretical work, some of the basic and creative thoughts in this collection still have guiding significance and reference value today.

This collection covers a period of 28 years that holds an extremely important position in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was a period when Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice, was developing, and when the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, was gradually maturing. From this period onwards, Deng Xiaoping, over the course of 28 years, whether leading the frontline of struggle in a region or a specific area, or participating in the overall leadership of the Party at the central level, consistently and unwaveringly implemented the major decisions and directives of the Party Central Committee. He creatively applied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to his practice. This collection vividly embodies this point. Deng Xiaoping's thoughts have a clear consistency, and reading this collection carefully will be beneficial for deeply understanding the many important thoughts and proposals he put forward after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Strategic Thinking from a Global Perspective

Deng Xiaoping is an outstanding strategist. This collection prominently reflects his image as a strategist. This is evident in his handling of issues, always from a global perspective, with a far-sighted vision, subordinating local interests to the overall situation to achieve overall victory. He is good at overseeing the entire situation, coordinating and balancing, seeing far, thinking deeply, and handling arduous tasks with ease and complex situations with composure. In the 28 years covered by this collection, he spent a long time independently managing the work of a strategic region, and later became a core member of the central leadership, always maintaining this characteristic. Mao Zedong highly praised his global thinking and leadership abilities, introducing Deng Xiaoping to foreign leaders by saying that the Huaihai Campaign was directed by the General Front Committee, which he headed. The Huaihai Campaign was one of the three major strategic battles between the People's Liberation Army and the Nationalist Army, resulting in the annihilation of 555,000 enemy troops.

During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking was reflected in the long-term military struggles and anti-enemy struggles. "A Brief Summary of Five Years of Anti-Enemy Struggles" is a representative military work by Deng Xiaoping from the Anti-Japanese War period. It is excerpted from a report he gave at the High-Level Cadres Conference of the Communist Party of China's Central Taihang Bureau in January 1943. The Taihang area, also known as the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, was an important strategic base in the anti-Japanese rear areas, where the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and the Headquarters of the 129th Division were located. At that time, Deng Xiaoping concurrently served as the Secretary of the Taihang Bureau, and the Anti-Japanese War was in its most arduous stalemate phase. Based on five years of struggle experience, he proposed a series of strategic thoughts to guide the overall war. These strategic thoughts were universally applicable in the anti-Japanese struggles in the rear areas. He emphasized, "Our comrades do not fully understand the political significance that our every move in the rear areas can influence the entire nation, so they often lack a global perspective." He believed that this concept should be established, especially among cadres and leading cadres. His strategic thinking of being in Taihang but looking at the entire nation, standing firm in the current anti-war efforts, and striving for post-war nation-building, pointed the way for the persistence of the North China anti-war efforts.

During the Liberation War, Deng Xiaoping's global strategic thinking was prominently reflected in the Central Plains battlefield. "The Victory Situation in the Advance to the Central Plains and Future Policies and Strategies" is another important military work. It is a report he gave at the joint meeting of the Front and Rear Commissions of the Central Plains, held in Lu Mountain, Henan, in April 1948. In June 1947, Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping led the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army from strategic defense to strategic offense, advancing thousands of miles into the Central Plains, establishing a base in the Dabie Mountains, and achieving significant strategic victories, posing a great threat to the Nationalist Party. However, under the pursuit and siege of the enemy, the troops they led also paid a heavy price and encountered many difficulties. Some cadres and soldiers had ideological problems. Deng Xiaoping, in this article, educated the troops to have a global perspective and to use Marxist methods to view problems, not to "see a small cloud over your head and think the whole world is cloudy." He said, "Now, the Central Plains have attracted more than half of Chiang Kai-shek's forces in the southern line, ensuring the victory and development of other regions. Although we suffer the most and pay the price in the national scope, we have gained strategic initiative and achieved overall victory." He used an analogy: a yoke, with a heavier end and a lighter end. We bear more in the Dabie Mountains, so other troops can annihilate more enemies and deepen their work. Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of subordinating local interests to the overall situation had a significant impact on the overall victory of the war. Therefore, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, when commenting on the war situation, first mentioned the Central Plains and highly valued the achievements there.

Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of always considering the overall situation is consistent and permeates all aspects of his work. In 1952, after being transferred from the Southwest to the Central Government, he initially served as the Vice Premier and Minister of Finance. As soon as he took over the financial work, he clarified the relationship between financial work and national construction, and between local and central finances. In his speeches "Six Principles of Financial Work" and "Local Financial Work Should Have a Global Perspective," he pointed out the political purpose of financial work, which is to place national finances on a stable and reliable foundation to ensure investment in national industrialization and funds for socialist transformation, and to have the strength to deal with external threats and emergencies. He discussed the relationship between the overall and local situations, between the central and local governments, and between centralized unity and local conditions, pointing out that both are necessary, but the former is dominant. If there is a conflict, the latter should be subordinated to the former. In other words, small matters should be subordinated to big matters. Deng Xiaoping's clear global perspective has long-term guiding significance for the entire nation's socialist construction.

Whether in war leadership, construction, or reform, whether leading the work of a strategic region or a specific area, or guiding the work of the entire nation, Deng Xiaoping always prominently demonstrates his character as a great strategist. He always focuses on overall issues, placing his attention on aspects that are decisive for the overall situation rather than secondary aspects. His decisions not only consider the overall situation (the overall situation of China and even the world) but also consider long-term development over the next few decades. This characteristic is not only reflected in this collection but is more vividly reflected in his works and practices since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win

In 1960, when the fourth volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published, Deng Xiaoping summarized the ideological content of this book in eight characters: "Dare to struggle, dare to win." Now, when we evaluate this "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," we can also regard "Dare to struggle, dare to win" as one of its main ideological contents.

Being decisive and unyielding in the face of key moments, daring to engage in tenacious struggles in the face of storms and waves, is a prominent characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's style. In his works from the Liberation War period, the articles discussing the advance to the Central Plains and the establishment of the Dabie Mountains base best reflect Deng Xiaoping's thoughts of daring to struggle and daring to win. To execute the directives of the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong, to move the main forces to the Nationalist-controlled areas, to shift from internal to external warfare, and to shift from strategic defense to strategic offense, the Liu-Deng Army, with great courage, bravely undertook the arduous task of advancing thousands of miles into the Dabie Mountains. Along the way, they faced long-distance warfare without a rear base, had to overcome the obstacles of the Yellow River floodplain, and defeat the pursuit of tens of thousands of enemy troops. The difficulties and hardships can be imagined, and without a firm revolutionary belief and courageous revolutionary spirit, it would be impossible to complete this advance task. The articles "Establishing a Solid Base in the Dabie Mountains" and "The Victory Situation in the Advance to the Central Plains and Future Policies and Strategies" are full of passion, praising the revolutionary spirit and heroic demeanor of this army, and also expressing Deng Xiaoping's thoughts and courage of daring to struggle and daring to win.

After the army arrived in the Dabie Mountains, the first task was to open up new areas, establish a base, consolidate the foothold, and then further expand the liberated areas. "Establishing a Solid Base in the Dabie Mountains" is a directive issued by Deng Xiaoping in the name of the Central Plains Bureau of the Communist Party of China to the subordinate troops after he arrived in the Dabie Mountains. The directive begins by declaring, "Our army has successfully completed the task of crossing the Huai River and advancing into the Dabie Mountains, completely foiling the enemy's pursuit plan." It then firmly states, "The future task is to wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly create a solid base in the Dabie Mountains and, in cooperation with neighboring troops, fully control the Central Plains." "Our slogan is to share the fate of the people of E-Huai-Anhui, liberate the Central Plains, and liberate the people of E-Huai-Anhui." Reading this, one can strongly feel the courage and determination of the frontline commanders in the extremely difficult environment to persist in the Dabie Mountains struggle.

The question of whether this struggle in the Dabie Mountains could be victorious, whether we could stand firm in the Dabie Mountains, was the most concerning issue at the time. Some comrades were not very confident, and some comrades found it hard to endure the difficulties; some troops from the north were not accustomed to the southern life and were afraid to cross the Yangtze River; some people even developed a fear of the Americans. Deng Xiaoping, in his Lu Mountain report, deeply analyzed the situation of the struggle and concluded, "We have already stood firm, and the enemy can never drive us away." He also conducted ideological and political work to address the ideological problems at the time. He used these words to educate everyone, "Revolution is not so comfortable, and it will be even more difficult in the future. The closer we get to victory, the more difficult the struggle will be. Everyone hopes for a quick revolutionary victory, but the question is, do you dare to win?" He also addressed the fear of the Americans, "Not only is it not easy for the Americans to intervene, but even if they do, I want to ask: do you still want to revolutionize?" He said, "A good communist should answer: fight to the end!" He also educated, "Possessing excellent qualities, a communist should answer: fight to the end!"

The question of whether to dare to win is not only a sharp issue facing the Central Plains battlefield but also a national issue. At that time, facing the well-equipped Nationalist Army, which was numerically superior, the People's Liberation Army was in a very difficult situation; to cross the Yangtze River and liberate the entire nation, there were countless difficulties and obstacles. Deng Xiaoping's thoughts of daring to struggle and daring to win, and his fearless revolutionary spirit, not only educated and inspired the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the Central Plains but also expressed the Chinese Communist Party's resolute spirit to carry the revolution to the end.

Everything from Actual Conditions

Seeking truth from facts, combining theory with practice, and everything from actual conditions, are the basic viewpoints of Marxism. Deng Xiaoping regarded the four characters "seeking truth from facts" as the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. He himself was a consistent example of adhering to this thought. In the long-term revolutionary and construction practices, from both positive and negative experiences and lessons, he firmly established this thought and belief. It was precisely because of his deep understanding of Marxism that, at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he broke through the serious ideological constraints of the "Two Whatevers" and bravely proposed to restore the thought line of seeking truth from facts, which became the cornerstone for formulating the line, policies, and principles since the Third Plenary Session.

In the history of our Party, whether to adhere to seeking truth from facts and whether to do everything from actual conditions have always been major principles. They relate to the success or failure of revolutionary and construction efforts. From this collection, it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping often used this aspect of historical experience to educate cadres and used the rectification method to improve the awareness of cadres and Party members. In November 1943, in his speech at the rectification mobilization meeting of the North China Bureau Party School, he compared the positive and negative experiences in history and pointed out that the several setbacks and failures of the Chinese revolution before 1935 were all caused by the leadership dominated by the three incorrect tendencies of subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party jargon. This is one aspect of the experience. There is another aspect of the experience, which is that since the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee led by Mao Zedong, our Party overcame the "left" and "right" opportunism within the Party, swept away the past incorrect tendencies, and the Party's cause developed victoriously. He warned his comrades to remember these historical experiences and lessons.

Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic spirit of seeking truth from facts and everything from actual conditions is reflected in his keen insight into objective things and his creative application of Marxist theory and the Party Central Committee's directives. The directive he drafted for the Central Plains Bureau and issued on June 6, 1948, "Carrying Out the Central Committee's Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification Work," reflects his thought of starting from actual conditions when solving complex problems and his ability to discover new problems and creatively carry out the Central Committee's directives. At that time, the new areas of the Central Plains were undergoing land reform. Deng Xiaoping, aware of the past mistakes of the new areas, such as rushing and alienating the masses, causing many difficulties in anti-enemy struggles and establishing bases, proposed in the directive he drafted for the Central Plains Bureau that the entire area should "reconsider our work guidelines and strategic steps." The directive he drafted was based on the actual situation of the Central Plains region, but it also had universal guiding significance for the land reform work in the newly liberated areas facing new situations and new problems. Mao Zedong highly praised this document and added two paragraphs, which were then circulated by the Central Committee to various places. In the letter he wrote to Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and others when circulating the document, Mao Zedong said, "With this document from the Central Plains Bureau, the Central Committee does not need to issue such documents anymore."

Deng Xiaoping's 1950 speech "On the Issue of Minority Nationalities in the Southwest" is another important article reflecting his characteristic of starting from actual conditions. The Southwest is the region with the most minority nationalities in China, with relatively complex situations, and historical estrangement between minority nationalities and the Han nationality. Deng Xiaoping, starting from this special situation, proposed that the central task of national work is to improve unity and eliminate estrangement, especially emphasizing the need to prevent "acute disease" in national work. Whether political, economic, or cultural work, it must be discussed with minority nationalities and gain the approval of the majority, especially the upper-class people. At that time, some comrades had reservations about focusing on working with the upper-class people, fearing that this would lose their position. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: These comrades do not understand that class positions are different there. "What is the correct class position? It is not to launch class struggles now, but to achieve unity between nationalities, which is the correct class position." His thought of not engaging in subjectivism and dogmatism, and formulating policies and principles based on the actual situation at that time and place, played an important guiding role in solving the complex issue of minority nationalities in the Southwest.

In September 1956, the Eighth National Congress of the Party pointed out that the main task of the people of the entire nation is to concentrate on developing social productive forces, achieving national industrialization, and gradually satisfying the people's growing material and cultural needs. The line of the Eighth Congress is correct. It was proposed based on the basic situation that the three major transformations were basically completed, and the main social contradictions had changed. In March and April 1957, Deng Xiaoping traveled from Taiyuan and Lanzhou to Xi'an, promoting the tasks proposed by the Eighth Congress along the way. In his report to cadres in Xi'an, "The Main Task Now is Construction," he insisted on the Eighth Congress's analysis of China's actual situation, clearly pointing out that since the basic completion of the three major transformations, the revolutionary task was also basically completed, and the main task now is construction. The value of this report lies in proposing the guiding ideology of construction from China's national conditions, "facing the reality of the state" and "facing the needs of the masses." He sharply criticized the subjectivism, mainly dogmatism, in the construction issue, with some people always pursuing big and new things. Here, Deng Xiaoping already touched on the drawbacks of copying foreign experiences, regarding it as a serious shortcoming exposed in construction.

The thought of everything from actual conditions is not easy to consistently adhere to; when the Party's thought line of seeking truth from facts is destroyed, it requires courage to adhere to this thought. In 1962, the three years of difficulties had not yet passed, and agricultural production had not yet recovered. To quickly restore agricultural production, in many places across the country, there were phenomena of peasants and grassroots cadres, including some Party members, demanding the implementation of the household contract responsibility system. This was a major issue facing our Party. What should be done? Deng Xiaoping, in response to the situation at the time, in the article "How to Restore Agricultural Production," said a very important sentence. He said, "The form of the production relationship that is best is probably to adopt such an attitude: whichever form in which place can relatively easily and quickly restore and develop agricultural production, that form should be adopted; whichever form the masses are willing to adopt, that form should be adopted, and make it legal." He also used a metaphor: "Yellow cat, black cat, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat." Here, the illegal making it legal refers to the household contract responsibility system. Deng Xiaoping's thought, for people who have undergone changes since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, seems like no problem, but at that time, under the guidance of "leftist" thoughts, adhering to this correct attitude required courage and wisdom. Today, when we look back at these past events, we feel even more that Deng Xiaoping's consistent advocacy and adherence to seeking truth from facts and everything from actual conditions are very precious.

Building a Good Party

In the history of China's revolution and construction, Deng Xiaoping has long been responsible for the Party's leadership. He has long been responsible for the Party's leadership in a region or the army, and he served as the General Secretary for 10 years before the "Cultural Revolution." He has rich experience and profound insights into Party building. This collection contains many articles on the Party.

How to properly handle the relationship between the Party and the government is an important issue in correctly exerting the Party's leadership. The Party must lead the government at all levels, but it should not take over the government's work. Handling this relationship is not easy. Deng Xiaoping, as early as before our Party took national power, paid great attention to this issue. In 1941, he published the article "The Party and the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government," which is one of the earliest important documents on the Party-government relationship. At that time, the governments at all levels in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border area were about to be established. The article made profound discussions on how the Party should lead the government and what kind of working relationship the Party and the government should have. Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out that the correct leadership principle of the Party over the anti-Japanese democratic government is to adopt the policy of guidance and supervision. The leadership responsibility of the Party should be placed on political principles, not on taking over everything and interfering in everything. The article criticized some comrades who thought that the Party's leadership meant "the Party is above everything" and even "Party members are above everything," and did not pay attention to democratic spirit when leading the united front's three-three system government work. It also sharply pointed out that these incorrect thoughts were a reflection of the Kuomintang's evil tradition of "rule by the Party" in our Party. These discussions are still important for understanding today's principle of separating the Party from the government and overcoming the phenomenon of the Party replacing the government.

After the Party took national power, the construction of the ruling Party became a major issue. The main article in the collection discussing this issue is "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution," "The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision," and "Speech at the Enlarged Central Work Conference."

First, there must be a clear understanding of the position of the ruling Party and the heavy responsibilities of the Party members of the ruling Party. Deng Xiaoping, as early as during his work in the Southwest, keenly sensed some dangerous tendencies that began to appear within the Party after taking power. Some comrades thought that "the revolution has succeeded, so we can sleep, be proud, enjoy, and not work hard," and developed serious bureaucratism, commandism, and corrupt thoughts. In 1954, the Gao-Rao incident occurred. Deng Xiapling pointed out that after the revolution succeeded, especially among high-level cadres within the Party, pride and self-satisfaction grew, which would harm the Party's unity and the Party's cause. At the Eighth Congress and afterwards, Deng Xiaoping made a comprehensive and profound discussion on the construction of the ruling Party. He said that the position of the ruling Party makes our Party face new tests. Our Party has high prestige, and a large number of cadres are in leading positions. He raised a very sharp question: "In China, who has the qualification to make big mistakes? It is the Chinese Communist Party. If mistakes are made, the impact is the greatest." We have taken power and held power, so we must be more cautious. At the same time, he pointed out that we "cannot let the power be taken by the bourgeoisie" and "cannot let the power be taken by opportunists." Deng Xiaoping's discussions raised the awareness and vigilance of Party members.

Second, the ruling Party must continuously strengthen its own construction. It must take strengthening measures in terms of ideology, style, organization, and system according to the different situations of each period. From the collection, it can be seen that some basic ideas that Deng Xiaoping often emphasized are: in ideological construction, to make the majority of cadres and Party members master the thought of combining Marxism-Leninism with the specific reality of the Chinese revolution, that is, Mao Zedong Thought. In style construction, to advocate the style of combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and self-criticism (of course, including criticism). The Party must always pay attention to fighting against subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and always be on guard against the dangers of detachment from reality and the masses. In organizational construction and system construction, to insist on democratic centralism, to implement collective leadership and division of labor, to establish a core, to create a lively and active political situation, and to build a unified, cohesive, disciplined, and combat-effective Party.

Third, the Communist Party must accept supervision. Supervision comes from three aspects: Party supervision, mass supervision, and supervision from the democratic parties and non-partisan democrats.

Deng Xiaoping had an overall assessment of our Party, believing that our Party has many advantages. As long as we strengthen the construction of the ruling Party based on its characteristics and carry forward the Party's fine traditions, our Party will surely, just as it led the revolution to victory, smoothly lead the construction of the state.

Deng Xiaoping's basic thoughts on the construction of the ruling Party still have important guiding significance today.

Upholding Mao Zedong Thought

Mao Zedong Thought is the scientific theory that combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice. Deng Xiaoping, in the decades-long revolutionary struggle, consistently took Mao Zedong Thought as his guideline, upheld Mao Zedong Thought, defended Mao Zedong Thought, and developed Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. From this collection, it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping had a personal experience of Mao Zedong's correct leadership, a deep understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, and in his own leadership work, he always insisted on implementing Mao Zedong's correct thoughts and decisions, so that the regions and troops he led could relatively smoothly accomplish various tasks.

Deng Xiaoping's firm belief in Mao Zedong Thought comes from practice and from the comparison and summary of the positive and negative experiences in the history of the Party. In 1943, at the rectification mobilization meeting of the North China Bureau Party School, he said, "The Party's cause has been completely placed under the guidance of the Chinese Marxism-Leninism, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, for nine years, and it has not made any mistakes but has been developing victoriously. This fact is well known to everyone. Indeed, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee guided by Mao Zedong Thought, recalling the painful lessons of the past opportunist leadership, every comrade will feel that these nine years are very happy."

From the revolutionary war period to the construction period, our Party has always been guided by Mao Zedong Thought to achieve one victory after another. However, sometimes work encounters difficulties and setbacks. In such situations, Deng Xiaoping always insisted on Mao Zedong Thought and defended Mao Zedong Thought. Since 1958, our Party has made mistakes, and during the three years of difficulties, some people have had doubts about whether the Party can lead various aspects of work well. Deng Xiaoping, at the enlarged Central Work Conference in 1962, said that our Party has five advantages, and the first point is that it has a good guiding ideology, which is the Party's guiding ideology represented by Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "The Chinese revolution was not led to victory by any other ideology, but by Mao Zedong Thought. After the revolution succeeded, it was also under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought that our socialist construction achieved such great achievements and continued to advance victoriously." As the General Secretary of the Party, his speech played an important role in uniting the Party to overcome difficulties.

In March 1960, Deng Xiaoping, in response to the bias that appeared in the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, sharply criticized the vulgarization of Mao Zedong Thought and the separation of Mao Zedong Thought from Marxism-Leninism in his speech at the Tianjin Conference of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said, "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very serious and principled issue. Do not vulgarize it. Do not just talk about Mao Zedong Thought without mentioning Marxism-Leninism. Never forget Marxism-Leninism, do not forget this most fundamental thing." In this speech, Deng Xiaoping also opposed placing Mao Zedong above the collective leadership of the Party Central Committee. He said, "Our Party is a collective leadership. Mao Zedong is the representative of this collective leadership, the leader of our Party, and his position and role are different from those of ordinary collective leadership members. However, it is absolutely not appropriate to separate Mao Zedong from the Party Central Committee. Mao Zedong should be regarded as a member of the Party's collective leadership, and his role in our Party should be described in a realistic manner."

Deng Xiaoping's discussions reflect his principled and scientific attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. His attitude is consistent and unwavering. After the "Cultural Revolution," starting from 1977, Deng Xiaoping bravely broke through the personal cult of Mao Zedong, first criticizing the error of the "Two Whatevers," and proposing that Mao Zedong Thought is a system and should be understood completely and accurately. However, when our Party criticized the "Two Whatevers" and corrected the errors of Mao Zedong in his later years, a trend of denying Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong emerged. Deng Xiaoping bravely stood up again to defend Mao Zedong Thought. He timely proposed to uphold the four cardinal principles in ideological and political aspects, one of which is to uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. From March 1980 to June 1981, Deng Xiaoping personally presided over the drafting of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" and gave nine important speeches. He said that the purpose of drafting this resolution is to uphold the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to objectively and appropriately evaluate the "Cultural Revolution," to evaluate the merits and demerits of Mao Zedong, to summarize experiences, to unite thoughts, and to look forward. He emphasized that the core issue is the evaluation of Mao Zedong. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee adopted this resolution, giving a scientific evaluation of Mao Zedong's historical position and Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, our Party, under new historical conditions, upheld and developed Mao Zedong Thought. The facts show that Deng Xiaoping made special contributions to upholding and developing Mao Zedong Thought. His theoretical thoughts are themselves an important component of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　马克思主义与中国实际情况相结合的重要文献
　　——介绍《邓小平文选》（一九三八—一九六五年）
　　潘荣庭
    一本汇集了邓小平同志“文化大革命”以前28年主要著作的《邓小平文选》已经编辑出版。这本著作按时间顺序，可以说是《邓小平文选》的第一卷，而1983年出版的《邓小平文选》（1975—1982年）可以说是它的第二卷。
    新出版的这本《邓小平文选》，是一部重要的历史文献。它开卷于1938年，那时抗日战争刚开始不久，邓小平同志正担任八路军政治部副主任。文选终卷于1965年，就是“文化大革命”前夕，这时邓小平同志已经当了10年的党中央总书记。前后28年，选入文选的著作共39篇，这是从现存的几千件文稿资料中精选出来的。在战火纷飞的年代，有些著作很可能没有保存下来，所以有的年份有的重要事件没有适当的著作加以反映。但是总的看来，这本文选在很大程度上反映了邓小平同志在抗日战争、解放战争、建国后17年这几个历史时期，从理论上和实践上对军事、政治、经济、党的建设等方面作出的贡献。
    作为历史文献，这本文选提供的珍贵内容，有助于人们认识中国革命和建设事业在这几个历史时期的发展历史，认识中国共产党领导人的原则立场和创造精神。作为理论著作，这本文选中一些基本的、富有创造性的思想，对于今天仍有指导意义和借鉴作用。
    这本文选中涉及的是中国共产党历史上占有极其重要地位的28年。进入抗日战争时期，正是马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想日益发展的时期，是以毛泽东同志为领导核心的中国共产党全党逐步成熟的时期。邓小平同志自这一时期起，28年来，无论在一个地区、一个方面担负斗争第一线的指挥工作，还是进入中央领导核心参与党的全面领导工作，他都坚定不移地贯彻执行党中央的重大决策和指示，把马列主义毛泽东思想创造性地运用于自己的实践，他的这本著作鲜明生动地体现了这一点。邓小平同志的思想有着明显的一贯性，认真地读一读这本文选，对深入理解他在十一届三中全会后提出的许多重要思想和主张也会有很多益处。
      从全局出发的战略思想
    邓小平同志是一位杰出的战略家。这本文选突出地反映出了他的战略家的形象。这表现在：他处理问题总是时时处处从全局出发，高瞻远瞩，以小局服从大局，求得全局的胜利。他善于总揽全局，统筹兼顾，看得远，想得深，对艰巨的任务举重若轻，对复杂的情况应付自如。在这本文选所涉及的28年中，他很长时间独当一面地主持一个战略地区的工作，以后又成为中央领导层的核心成员，始终保持着这个特色。毛泽东同志很称赞他这种全局思想和指挥领导才能，向外国领导人介绍小平同志时说，淮海战役就是以他为书记的总前委指挥的。淮海战役是人民解放军同国民党军队进行战略决战的三大战役之一，这个战役歼敌55.5万人。
    在抗日战争、解放战争时期，邓小平同志的战略思想体现在长期的军事斗争、对敌斗争中。《五年来对敌斗争的概略总结》是邓小平同志在抗日战争时期有代表性的军事著作。它选自1943年1月在中共中央太行分局高级干部会议上的报告。太行区也称晋冀鲁豫区，是抗日敌后根据地中的重要战略基地，八路军总部、中共中央北方局、一二九师师部都设在这里。当时邓小平同志兼任太行分局书记，抗日战争尚处在最艰苦的相持阶段。他根据五年来的斗争经验，提出了一系列指导战争全局的战略思想。这些战略思想在敌后的抗日斗争中是普遍适用的。他强调说：“我们同志对于我们在敌后斗争的一举一动都可以影响全国这种政治意义认识不够，所以往往缺乏全局观念”；“我们一切政策行动都应不仅照顾到根据地本身，而且要照顾到对全国的影响。”他认为这个观念应在干部中特别在领导干部中树立起来。他的这种身在太行，放眼全国，立足当前抗战，争取战后建国的战略思想，为坚持华北抗战指明了方向。
    在解放战争时期，邓小平同志的全局战略思想突出地表现在中原战场上。《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》是又一篇重要军事著作。它是1948年4月在河南鲁山召开的豫陕鄂前委和后委联席会议上的报告。1947年6月，刘伯承同志和邓小平同志率领晋冀鲁豫野战军由战略防御转入战略进攻，千里跃进中原，在大别山地区建立根据地，取得了战略上的很大胜利，给国民党造成极大威胁。但是同时，在强敌尾追和围攻下，他们领导的部队也付出了重大的代价，遇到了好多困难。干部战士中出现了一些思想问题。邓小平同志在这篇文章中，教育部队要有全局观念，要用马克思主义的思想方法看问题，不能“看见自己头上有一小块云，就认为天下都是云”。他说：“现在，中原吸引了蒋介石南线的一半以上的兵力，保证了其他地区的胜利展开。虽在全国范围吃苦头最多，付出了代价，但换取了战略上的主动，取得了全局的胜利。”他打了一个比喻：一副担子，有重的一头，有轻的一头，我们在大别山背重些，其他部队就能大量歼灭敌人和深入开展工作。邓小平同志这种从全局出发，局部利益服从全局利益的战略思想，对整个战局的胜利发展起了重大影响。所以，党中央和毛主席在评论战局的时候，第一讲到中原，对中原的成绩估计很大。
    邓小平同志这种时时处处从全局出发的战略思想是一贯的，是贯穿到各个方面的工作的。1952年他从西南调到中央，开始时担任副总理兼财政部长。他一着手抓财政工作，就把财政工作与国家建设的关系、地方财政与中央财政的关系理清楚了。他在《财政工作的六条方针》和《地方财政工作要有全局观念》两篇讲话中，指明了财政工作方针的政治目的，就是要把国家财政放在经常的、稳固的、可靠的基础上，以保证国家工业化的投资和进行社会主义改造的经费，有力量应付外侮和应付万一；论述了财政工作中全局与局部的关系，中央与地方的关系，集中统一与因地制宜的关系，指出在这些关系中，二者缺一不可，但是前者是主导，如果发生矛盾，后者应服从前者，一句话，就是小道理服从大道理。邓小平同志这种非常明确的全局观点，对整个国家的社会主义建设事业都有长远指导意义。
    邓小平同志不论在战争指导上，还是在建设和改革事业的指导上；不论在领导一个战略地区或一个方面的工作，还是指导全国的工作，都突出地表现他作为一个伟大战略家的品格。他总是抓全局性的问题，把自己的注意力放在对全局有决定意义的方面而不是次要的方面。他作出的决策，不仅从全局（中国这个全局以至世界这个全局）考虑问题，而且从长远，从今后几十年的发展考虑问题。这个特点，不仅体现在这本文选里，更鲜明地体现在十一届三中全会以来的著作和他的实践中。
      敢于斗争　敢于胜利
    1960年《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版的时候，邓小平同志对这本书的思想内容用八个字来概括，叫做“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”。现在，当我们评价这本《邓小平文选》的时候，也可以把“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”看作是它的主要思想内容之一。
    坚决果断，在关键时刻毫不动摇，敢于在大风大浪中进行顽强不屈的斗争，这是邓小平同志在作风上的显著特点。在解放战争时期的著作中，论述跃进中原、创建大别山根据地的文章最能体现出邓小平同志敢于斗争敢于胜利的思想。为了执行党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，以主力打到国民党统治区，由内线作战转入外线作战，由战略防御转入战略进攻，刘邓大军以大无畏的气概，英勇地担负起了千里跃进大别山的艰巨任务。一路上是长距离无后方作战，要克服遍地积水淤泥的黄泛区的阻隔，战胜几十万敌军的前堵后追，艰难困苦的程度可想而知，没有坚定的革命信念和勇敢的革命精神，是不可能完成这个跃进任务的。《创建巩固的大别山根据地》和《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》两文，充满激情地宣扬了这支军队的革命精神和英雄气概，同时也表达了邓小平同志的敢于斗争敢于胜利的思想和胆略。
    部队到达大别山后的首要任务是开辟新区，建立根据地，巩固立足点，然后进一步扩大解放区。《创建巩固的大别山根据地》就是邓小平同志到达大别山后以中共中央中原局的名义向所属部队发出的指示。这个指示一开头就宣告：“我军已胜利完成渡过淮河、进入大别山之跃进任务，敌人的追击计划完全失败。”接着斩钉截铁地说：“今后的任务，是全心全意地义无反顾地创造巩固的大别山根据地，并与友邻兵团配合，全部控制中原。”“我们的口号是与鄂豫皖人民共存亡，解放中原，使鄂豫皖人民获得解放。”人们读到这里，可以强烈地感受到当时前线指挥员在极端艰难的环境中坚持大别山斗争的勇气与决心。
    大别山的这场斗争究竟能不能胜利，我们在大别山能不能站住脚，这是当时人们最关心的问题。有些同志并不是很有信心的，有的同志在困难面前觉得有些难熬；北方的一些部队不习惯南方生活，怕过长江；有的人还产生恐美病，怕美国出兵。邓小平同志在鲁山报告中深入分析斗争形势，作出了“我们已经站住了脚，敌人无论如何打不走我们了”的结论，并且针对当时思想问题开展思想政治工作。他用这样的话来教育大家：“革命就是不能那样舒服，往后还要更艰苦，越接近胜利斗争越艰苦。谁都希望革命快些胜利，可是，问你敢不敢胜利，问题就来了。不一定希望胜利的人就敢于胜利。”“真正的英雄，就是要克服困难，准备吃苦，准备勇敢坚决地打过长江。”他还针对恐美思想进行教育：“不要说美国出兵不是那样容易，就是出兵，我要反问：你还革命不革命？”“具有优良品质的共产党员，应该回答：和他干，干到底！”
    敢不敢胜利的问题，不仅是摆在中原战区面前的一个尖锐问题，也是全国性的问题。当时，面对装备优良、在数量上超过自己的国民党军队，中国人民解放军还处在很困难的境地；要打过长江，解放全国，更有许许多多的甚至难以想象的艰难险阻。邓小平同志敢于斗争敢于胜利的思想和大无畏的革命精神，不仅教育和鼓舞了中原地区的广大军民，也表达了中国共产党将革命进行到底的坚毅精神。
            一切从实际出发
    实事求是，理论联系实际，一切从实际出发，是马克思主义的基本观点。邓小平同志把“实事求是”四个字称作是毛泽东思想的精髓。他自己就是始终如一地坚持这一思想的榜样。在长期的革命和建设实践中，从正反两方面的经验教训中，他牢固地树立起这一思想和信念。正是由于对马克思主义的深刻理解，他在党的十一届三中全会上，冲破“两个凡是”对人们的严重思想束缚，勇敢地提出恢复实事求是的思想路线，这成为制定三中全会以来路线、方针、政策的基石。
    在我们党的历史上，是否坚持实事求是，能否做到一切从实际出发，始终是一个重大原则问题，它关系到革命和建设事业的成败。从这本文选中可以看到，邓小平同志经常以这方面的历史经验教育干部，并且用整风的方法提高干部和党员的觉悟。1943年11月他在北方局党校整风动员会上的讲话，以历史上正反两方面的经验作对比，指出中国革命在1935年之前的几次挫折和失败，都是主观主义、宗派主义、党八股这三种不正派的作风占统治地位的领导所造成的恶果。这是一方面的经验。还有另一方面的经验，就是我党自从1935年1月遵义会议之后，在以毛泽东为首的党中央领导之下，克服了党内“左”右倾机会主义，一扫过去的不正之风，党的事业就胜利地发展。他告诫同志，必须牢记这些历史经验教训。
    邓小平同志实事求是、一切从实际出发的求实精神，表现在对客观事物的洞察能力，体现在对马克思主义理论和党中央指示的富有创造性的运用。他为中原局起草、于1948年6月6日发出的《贯彻执行中共中央关于土改与整党工作的指示》，反映了他在解决复杂问题时从实际出发的思想和善于发现新问题、创造性地贯彻执行中央指示的才能。当时，中原新区正进行土改，邓小平同志鉴于以往新区犯有急性病的错误，以致脱离了群众，孤立了自己，在对敌斗争与确立根据地的事业上造成了许多困难，因此在为中原局起草的指示中，大胆地提出全区都应“重新地全盘考虑我们的工作方针和策略步骤”。他起草的指示是从中原地区的实际情况出发的，而对广大新解放区土地改革工作如何处理面对的新情况和新问题又有着普遍的指导意义。对这个文件，毛泽东同志给予高度评价，并增写了两段文字，由中央转发各地。毛泽东同志在转发时写给刘少奇、朱德、周恩来等同志的信中说：“有了中原局这个文件，中央就不需要再发这类文件了。”
      邓小平同志1950年《关于西南少数民族问题》的讲话，是又一篇反映他的从实际出发的思想特色的重要文章。西南是我国少数民族最多的地区，情况比较复杂，历史上少数民族与汉族隔阂很深。邓小平同志从这种特殊情况出发，提出民族工作的中心任务是搞好团结，消除隔阂，特别强调在民族工作上必须防止急性病。不论政治的、经济的、文化的工作，都要同少数民族商量，取得大多数人的赞成，特别是上层分子的赞成。当时，有些同志对着重做上层分子的工作，思想上有顾虑，以为这样就会丧失立场。邓小平同志指出：这些同志不懂得在那里阶级立场表现得不同。“什么叫正确的阶级立场？就是现在不要发动阶级斗争，做到民族与民族之间的团结，这就叫正确的阶级立场。”他的这种不搞主观主义和教条主义，从当时当地的实际情况出发制定方针政策的思想，对解决西南少数民族这样复杂的问题起了重要的指导作用。
    1956年9月党的八大指出，全国人民的主要任务是集中力量发展社会生产力，实现国家工业化，逐步满足人民日益增长的物质和文化需要。八大的路线是正确的，它是根据三大改造基本完成，社会主要矛盾已经转化这样一个基本状况提出的。1957年3、4月间，邓小平同志由太原、兰州到西安，一路宣传八大提出的任务。他在西安向干部所作的《今后的主要任务是搞建设》的报告，坚持八大对中国现实情况的分析，明确指出从三大改造基本完成时起，革命的任务也就基本上完成了，今后的主要任务是搞建设。这个报告的可贵之处在于提出从中国国情出发，“面对国家的现实”、“面对群众的需要”的建设指导思想。他尖锐地批评了在建设问题上脱离中国实际的主观主义，主要是教条主义的倾向，有些人总是贪大贪新。在这里，邓小平同志已经触及照搬国外经验的弊病，把它看作是建设中暴露出的严重缺点。
    一切从实际出发的思想，要一贯坚持不容易；在党的实事求是的思想路线遭到破坏的时候，要坚持这一思想更需要勇气。1962年，三年困难时期还没有过去，农业生产尚未恢复。为了尽快恢复农业生产，在全国许多地方发生农民和基层干部包括党内一些同志要求实行包产到户的现象。这是摆在我们党面前的一个重大问题。怎么办？邓小平同志针对当时的情况，在《怎样恢复农业生产》一文中讲了一段很重要的话。他说：“生产关系究竟以什么形式为最好，恐怕要采取这样一种态度，就是哪种形式在哪个地方能够比较容易比较快地恢复和发展农业生产，就采取哪种形式；群众愿意采取哪种形式，就应该采取哪种形式，不合法的使它合法起来。”并且使用了一个形象化的比喻：“黄猫、黑猫，只要抓住老鼠就是好猫。”这里所说的不合法的使它合法起来，就是指的包产到户。邓小平同志的这种思想，对经过党的十一届三中全会以来的变革的人们来讲，好像不是什么问题，但是在当时“左”的思想指导下，坚持这一正确态度需要有勇气和胆识。今天，当我们回顾这些往事的时候，更加感到邓小平同志一贯提倡和坚持实事求是、一切从实际出发的思想，是非常的可贵。
            建设一个好的党
    在中国革命和建设的历史上，邓小平同志长期担负党的领导重任。他长期在一个地区或军队中负责党的领导或政治工作，“文化大革命”前当了10年总书记。他对党的建设有丰富的经验和精辟的论述。这本文选中有多篇文章是论党的。
    怎样处理好党政关系，这是正确发挥党的领导作用的重要问题。党必须领导各级政府，但又不能包办代替政府的工作，处理好这个关系是不容易的。邓小平同志早在我们党取得全国政权之前，就十分重视这个问题。1941年他所发表的《党与抗日民主政权》一文，是我党论述党政关系最早的重要文献之一。当时，晋冀鲁豫边区各级政府即将成立。党如何领导政权，党与政权应是什么样的工作关系，文章作了精辟的论述。邓小平同志明确指出，党对抗日民主政权的正确领导原则是采取指导与监督政策，党的领导责任要放在政治原则上，而不是包办，不是遇事干涉。文中批评了有些同志以为党的领导就是“党权高于一切”甚至“党员高于一切”，不注意在领导统一战线的三三制政权工作时贯彻民主精神，并且尖锐地指出这些错误思想是国民党“以党治国”的恶劣传统在我们党内的反映。这些论述对于认识今天的党政分开原则，克服党政不分、以党代政的现象仍有重要意义。
    党在夺取全国政权后，执政党的建设成为重大课题。文选中论述这一问题的主要文章是《关于修改党的章程的报告》、《共产党要接受监督》、《在扩大的中央工作会议上的讲话》。
    首先，对执政党的地位和执政党的党员担负的重大责任必须要有清醒的认识。邓小平同志早在西南工作时期，就敏锐地察觉到党内在夺取政权后开始出现的一些危险倾向。有些同志认为“革命胜利了，可以睡觉了，可以骄傲了，应该享福了，不必努力了”，产生了严重的官僚主义、命令主义和蜕化腐朽思想。1954年发生高饶事件。邓小平同志指出，革命胜利后在党内尤其是高级干部中滋长了骄傲自满情绪，会损害党的团结和党的事业。在八大及其以后，邓小平同志对执政党的建设问题作了全面的深刻的论述。他说，执政党的地位使我们党面临着新的考验。我们党威信很高，大量的干部居于领导地位。他提出了一个十分尖锐的问题：“在中国来说，谁有资格犯大错误？就是中国共产党。犯了错误影响也最大。”我们执了政，拿了权，更要谨慎。同时又指出，我们“不能让权被资产阶级拿到手上”，“不能让权被机会主义者拿到手上”。邓小平同志的这些论述，提高了党内同志的认识和警惕。
    其次，执政党要不断加强自身的建设。要针对各个时期的不同情况，从思想上、作风上、组织上、制度上采取加强的对策。从文选中可以看到，邓小平同志经常强调的一些基本思想是：在思想建设上，要使广大干部、党员掌握马克思列宁主义同中国革命的具体实际相结合的思想，即毛泽东思想。在作风建设上，提倡理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评（当然也包括批评）的作风。党必须经常注意进行反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的斗争，经常警戒脱离实际脱离群众的危险。在组织建设上、制度建设上，坚持实行民主集中制，实行集体领导和分工负责，树立核心，造成生动活泼的政治局面，建立一个统一的、团结的、有纪律的、有战斗力的党。
    第三，共产党要接受监督。监督来自三个方面，一是党的监督，二是群众的监督，三是民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督。
    邓小平同志对我们党有一个总的估计，认为我们党是有许多优点的党。只要根据执政党的特点，加强党的建设，发扬党的优良传统，我们党就一定能同过去领导革命取得胜利一样，顺利地领导国家建设。邓小平同志论述执政党建设的基本思想，在今天来讲，仍有重要指导意义。
            坚持毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想是马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的科学理论。邓小平同志在长达数十年的革命斗争中，一贯以毛泽东思想为指针，坚持毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，并在新的历史条件下发展了毛泽东思想。从这本文选中可以看到，邓小平同志对毛泽东同志的正确领导是有着亲身感受的，对毛泽东思想的理解是很深的，他在自己领导的工作中，始终坚持贯彻毛泽东同志的正确思想和决策，从而使他所领导的地区和部队能够比较顺利地实现各项任务。
    邓小平同志对毛泽东思想的坚定信念来源于实践，来源于对党的历史上正反两方面的经验的比较和总结。1943年他在北方局党校整风动员会上说：“把党的事业完全放在中国化的马列主义，即毛泽东思想的指导之下，直到现在已经九年的时间，不但没有犯过错误，而且一直是胜利地发展着。这种事实我们大家都知道得很清楚。的确，在以毛泽东思想为指导的党中央的领导之下，我们回忆起过去机会主义领导下的惨痛教训，每个同志都会感觉到这九年是很幸福的”。
    从革命战争时期一直到建设时期，我们党一直是在毛泽东思想的指导下取得一个又一个的胜利的。但是有时工作中也会遇到困难，遭受挫折。在这种情况下，邓小平同志总是坚持毛泽东思想，维护毛泽东思想。从1958年以来我们党犯了错误，三年困难时期，有些人思想上产生过党能不能领导好各方面工作的问题。邓小平同志在1962年扩大的中央工作会议上讲我们党有五好，第一条就讲有好的指导思想，就是以毛泽东思想为代表的党的指导思想。他说：“中国的革命，不是由别的思想引导到胜利的，而是由毛泽东思想引导到胜利的，革命胜利以后，也正是在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们的社会主义建设才获得了这样伟大的成就，并且继续胜利地前进着。”作为党的总书记，他的讲话对于团结全党渡过困难，是起到重要作用的。
    1960年3月，邓小平同志针对关于毛泽东思想的宣传中出现的偏向，在中共中央天津会议的讲话中，尖锐地批评把毛泽东思想庸俗化和离开马列主义讲毛泽东思想。他说：对待毛泽东思想是一个很严肃的原则性的问题，不要庸俗化。不能光讲毛泽东思想，不提马克思列宁主义。一定不要忘记马克思列宁主义，不要忘记这个最根本的东西。在这个讲话中，邓小平同志还反对把毛泽东同志摆在党中央集体领导之外、之上。他说：“我们党是集体领导，毛泽东同志是这个集体领导的代表人，是我们党的领袖，他的地位和作用同一般的集体领导成员是不同的。但是，切不可因此把毛泽东同志和党中央分开，应该把毛泽东同志看作是党的集体领导中的一个成员，把他在我们党里头的作用说得合乎实际。”
    邓小平同志这些论述，表现了他对待毛泽东思想所采取的原则的科学的态度。他的这种态度是一贯的、始终如一的。“文化大革命”以后，从1977年开始，邓小平同志勇敢地冲破对毛泽东同志的个人崇拜，首先批评“两个凡是”的错误，提出毛泽东思想是个体系，要完整地准确地理解毛泽东思想。但是，当着我们党批评“两个凡是”，纠正毛泽东同志晚年错误的时候，又出现一股否定毛泽东思想，否定毛泽东同志的思潮。邓小平同志又同样勇敢地首先起来捍卫毛泽东思想。他及时地提出要在思想政治方面坚持四项基本原则，其中一项就是坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想。从1980年3月至1981年6月，邓小平同志又亲自主持起草《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》，先后发表九次重要谈话。他说，起草这个决议的目的，就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，实事求是地、恰如其分地评价“文化大革命”，评价毛泽东同志的功过是非，总结经验，统一思想，团结一致向前看。他强调说，核心问题是对毛泽东同志的评价。十一届六中全会通过了这个决议，对毛泽东同志的历史地位和毛泽东思想作出科学评价。这样，我们党又在新的历史条件下，坚持并发展了毛泽东思想。事实说明，邓小平同志对坚持和发展毛泽东思想作出了特殊贡献。他的思想理论本身就是毛泽东思想的一个重要组成部分。
