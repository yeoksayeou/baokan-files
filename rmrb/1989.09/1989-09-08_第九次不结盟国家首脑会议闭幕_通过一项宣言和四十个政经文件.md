The Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement concluded this morning in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Representatives from 101 non-aligned countries unanimously adopted the Ninth Summit Declaration and 40 specialized political and economic documents.

During the four-day summit, 78 heads of state and government, foreign ministers, and other high-ranking officials from non-aligned countries delivered speeches. Ten heads of state and foreign ministers submitted written statements. They engaged in heated discussions and debates on current international political and economic situations, the role and position of the Non-Aligned Movement in international affairs, the modernization of the Non-Aligned Movement, regional conflicts, debt issues, economic development, and other issues of direct interest to non-aligned and developing countries. These discussions and debates demonstrated that, despite differences and disparities within the Non-Aligned Movement, non-aligned countries can, based on the fundamental principles of the movement and with a realistic and cooperative attitude, find common solutions and paths to address contemporary substantive issues.

The declaration adopted at this summit outlines the views and solutions of non-aligned countries on the world situation and a series of major international political and economic issues. It also proposes five main tasks for the Non-Aligned Movement over the next three years. These tasks are: 1) to make further efforts for peace, disarmament, and the peaceful resolution of disputes; 2) to make joint efforts to effectively address major economic issues through constructive and fruitful dialogue; 3) to support the right to self-determination and independence of peoples under colonialism or foreign rule; 4) to take joint measures to protect the human environment; 5) to strengthen the role and efficiency of the United Nations, enabling it to fulfill all its legal responsibilities in addressing major issues. This declaration will serve as a guiding principle for the activities of non-aligned countries in the future.

Djuro Bjedov, the chairman of the Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement and the President of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, said in his closing speech that this summit is of great significance. It has laid a good foundation for the Non-Aligned Movement to adapt to the demands and challenges of the times. He said that although there are differences in opinions, a high degree of consensus has been reached on the most important issues regarding the activities of the Non-Aligned Movement, which is a great achievement and a great encouragement for the future actions of non-aligned countries.

The summit decided that the next meeting of foreign ministers of non-aligned countries will be held in Ghana in 1991. At that time, the venue and date of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement will be determined.

The Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted a declaration early this morning, emphasizing that the Non-Aligned Movement will continue to strive for a peaceful, free, just, and prosperous world.

In discussing the current international situation, the declaration pointed out that the world is at a crossroads. Tensions are no longer on the brink of explosion, but peace is still unstable; there may be hope, but there is no reason to be overly optimistic.

The declaration pointed out that the economic situation of most developing countries has seriously deteriorated. Accelerating the economic and social development of developing countries is not only necessary for these countries but also in the interest of the whole world. The declaration calls on developed countries to objectively face the conflict between wealth and poverty, believing that this conflict is deeper than the Cold War and bloc confrontation.

The declaration states that to respond to the challenges of the world, the Non-Aligned Movement must not be burdened by prejudices and dogmas, but must continuously explore new ways and means of action to improve the efficiency of the Non-Aligned Movement. The declaration emphasizes that only in this way can the historical mission of the Non-Aligned Movement be fulfilled.

In discussing the future activities of the Non-Aligned Movement, the declaration lists tasks such as maintaining world peace, solving international economic problems, opposing colonialism and foreign rule, protecting the human environment, safeguarding human rights, and strengthening the role of the United Nations.

The declaration points out that efforts to achieve peace, disarmament, and the peaceful resolution of disputes are the top priorities of the Non-Aligned Movement. The declaration emphasizes that disarmament cannot be achieved without the participation of all forces in the international community.

The declaration believes that without solving the problem of economic development gaps on a global scale, the world will not be stable and will not have a bright future. The declaration stresses the need to strengthen South-South cooperation and engage in constructive dialogue with developed countries on international economic issues.

The declaration points out that eradicating colonialism and achieving economic liberation, as a necessary precondition for strengthening political independence, is an important task for non-aligned countries. The declaration reaffirms support for all peoples living under colonialism or foreign rule and occupation in their struggle for self-determination and independence, and expresses solidarity with countries that have been invaded and interfered with.

The declaration states that the increasingly serious environmental problems pose a threat to human survival, and environmental protection has become a major global issue. The declaration calls for urgent cooperative measures and the formulation of global environmental protection conventions. The declaration demands an end to the harmful practice of transferring nuclear waste and other toxic waste to the territories or international waters of other countries.

    第九次不结盟国家首脑会议闭幕
    通过一项宣言和四十个政经文件
    新华社贝尔格莱德9月8日电  （记者王森）在南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德举行的第九次不结盟国家首脑会议于今晨闭幕。101个不结盟国家的代表们一致通过了第九次不结盟国家首脑会议宣言和40个专题性政治和经济文件。
    在为期4天的首脑会议的一般性辩论中，有78名不结盟国家元首和政府首脑、外长等发了言，10名国家首脑和外长作了书面发言。他们就当前的国际政治和经济局势、不结盟运动在国际事务中的地位和作用、不结盟运动现代化问题、地区冲突、债务问题、经济发展以及涉及不结盟国家和发展中国家切身利益的其他问题进行了热烈讨论和辩论。这些辩论和讨论表明，尽管在不结盟运动中存在分歧和差别，不结盟国家是能够本着不结盟运动的根本原则和抱着现实主义态度和合作精神，在解决当代实质性问题上找到共同的解决办法和途径的。
    本次不结盟国家首脑会议通过的宣言提出了不结盟国家对世界局势和一系列重大国际政治和经济问题的看法和解决途径，并提出了不结盟运动在今后3年中面临的5项主要任务。这些任务是：1、为和平、裁军和通过和平途径解决争端作出进一步努力；2、通过建设性的有成效的对话为有效地解决重大的经济问题作出共同努力；3、支持处于殖民主义或外国统治下的人民的自决和独立的权利；4、采取共同措施保护人类环境；5、加强联合国的作用和效率，使其在解决重大问题方面履行全部合法责任。这一宣言将成为不结盟国家今后开展活动的指导方针。
    第九次不结盟国家首脑会议执行主席、南斯拉夫联邦主席团主席德尔诺夫舍克在闭幕式发表讲话时指出，这次不结盟国家首脑会议具有重大意义。它使不结盟运动为适应时代的要求和挑战奠定了良好基础。他说，尽管会议在观点上存在分歧，但是在有关不结盟运动的最重要的活动方针问题上取得了高度一致，这是一个巨大的成就，它对不结盟国家今后的行动是一个巨大鼓舞。
    会议最后决定，下次不结盟国家外长会议于1991年在加纳举行。届时将决定第十次不结盟国家首脑会议的地点和日期。
    新华社贝尔格莱德9月8日电　第九次不结盟国家首脑会议今天凌晨在闭幕会议上通过一项宣言，强调不结盟运动将一如既往地继续努力为争取建立和平、自由、公正和繁荣的世界而斗争。
    在谈到当前国际形势时，宣言指出，世界正处在十字路口。紧张局势不再一触即发，但和平还不稳定；可能存在希望，但没有理由过分乐观。
    宣言指出，大多数发展中国家的经济状况严重恶化。加速发展中国家的经济和社会发展，不仅是这些国家所必须的，而且也符合全世界的利益。宣言呼吁发达国家要不带偏见地正视富裕和贫困之间的冲突，认为这种冲突比冷战和集团对抗更为深刻。
    宣言说，为了回答世界的挑战，不结盟运动不能背着偏见和教条的包袱，而必须不断探索新的活动方式和途径，以便提高不结盟运动的效率。宣言强调，只有这样才能担负起不结盟运动的历史使命。
    在谈到不结盟运动今后的活动重点时，宣言列举了维护世界和平、解决国际经济问题、反对殖民主义和外国统治、保护人类环境、保障人权以及加强联合国作用等任务。
    宣言指出，为争取和平、裁军与和平解决争端而努力是不结盟运动的首要任务。宣言强调，没有国际社会所有力量的参与，裁军是不可能实现的。
    宣言认为，不解决全球范围内经济发展的差距问题，世界就不可能稳定，也不可能有美好的前景。宣言强调必须加强南南合作，并就国际经济问题同发达国家进行建设性的对话。
    宣言指出，铲除殖民主义并使各国人民在经济上获得解放，作为加强其政治独立的必要前提，是不结盟国家的重要任务。宣言重申支持所有生活在殖民主义或外国统治和外国占领下的各国人民争取自决和独立的权利，表示要加强对被侵略和被干涉内政的国家的声援。
    宣言说，日益严重的环境问题构成了对人类生存的威胁，环境保护已成为全球性的重大问题。宣言要求采取紧急合作措施和制定全球性环境保护公约。宣言要求停止把核废料和其他有毒废料转移到他国领土或公海的有害做法。
