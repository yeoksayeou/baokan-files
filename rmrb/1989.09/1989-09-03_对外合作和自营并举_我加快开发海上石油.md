China's offshore oil industry is gradually demonstrating its enormous potential, revealing that in the 600,000 square kilometers of sea area available for oil and gas exploration, there lies a rich reserve of energy waiting to be released.

Three offshore oil fields that have already started production have already yielded over 450,000 tons of crude oil in the first half of this year, exceeding half of the annual production plan. This represents a 38% increase over the same period last year.

Currently, China is developing and constructing a total of 8 offshore oil and gas fields, of which 5 are in cooperation with foreign companies. In the first half of the year, $76 million was invested in the development of the cooperative areas, and 30 million yuan in the self-operated areas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation predicts that by 1991, the annual production capacity of offshore oil will reach 5 million tons, and natural gas will reach 1.2 billion cubic meters.

    我加快开发海上石油
    据新华社北京9月2日电　（记者黄晓南）中国海上石油工业正在逐步显示出其巨大的潜力，并揭示了中国60多万平方公里可供油气勘探的海域中蕴藏着等待释放的丰富能量。
    3个已投产的海上油田今年上半年已喷射出45万多吨原油，超过年生产计划的半数。比去年同期增长了38％。
    目前，中国正在开发建设的海上油气田共有8个，其中与外国公司合作的有5个。上半年在对外合作区完成了7600万美元的开发投资，自营区完成了3000万元。中国海洋石油总公司预计，到1991年海上石油年生产能力可达500万吨，天然气12亿立方。
