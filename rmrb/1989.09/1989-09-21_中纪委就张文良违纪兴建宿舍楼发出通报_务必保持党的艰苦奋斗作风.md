The Central Discipline Inspection Commission issued a circular titled "Must Maintain the Party's Spirit of Hard Work and Self-Denial" on September 19 regarding Zhang Wenliang, the Secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Committee, who violated regulations to build a private residence.

The full text of the circular is as follows:

Zhang Wenliang, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Committee, abused his power during his tenure to violate regulations and embezzle 53,000 yuan from the office repair fund to build a private residence for himself. Particularly, when some members of the Municipal Committee suggested stopping the construction and asked the responsible comrades to convey the relevant regulations of the State Council to Zhang Wenliang, he still insisted on his mistake and continued the construction, seriously violating the Party's discipline. The Fujian Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has seriously investigated and dealt with Zhang Wenliang's problem. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided, with the approval of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the report to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to remove Zhang Wenliang from his positions as a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee, Secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Committee, and a member of the Standing Committee.

As a Party member and leader, Zhang Wenliang should have correctly used the power entrusted by the Party and the people, been honest and upright, worked hard, and devoted all his strength to the Party's cause. However, he disappointed the Party and the people, using his power to pursue personal enjoyment and special treatment, embezzling a large amount of office repair funds to build a residence for himself, seriously alienating himself from the masses, and damaging the Party's image. It must be pointed out that the problem of building private residences in violation of regulations, similar to Zhang Wenliang, is not an isolated case. In some regions, the problem of Party and government cadres building private residences in violation of regulations is quite serious. Some ignore the repeated orders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, occupy more land and better land, build private residences exceeding the standard area, and renovate houses at a high standard; some embezzle public funds, arbitrarily seize state and collective assets, buy scarce building materials at low prices, and use labor and transportation tools free of charge; some violate financial discipline, borrow and embezzle a large amount of state funds, and even divert special funds to subsidize the construction of officials' houses; some blatantly build houses for rent, resale, and business, and illegally gain income from them. In some regions, Party and government cadres are not wholeheartedly leading the masses to get rid of poverty and become prosperous, but are keen on building their own comfortable nests, which has had a bad influence among the masses.

The problem of Party and government cadres building private residences in violation of regulations is a prominent issue in the current construction of Party style and clean government. Whether Party member cadres, especially Party member leaders, can correctly handle this issue is a practical test of their firm Party spirit. Our Party is a Party that serves the people wholeheartedly. Hard work and self-denial are the Party's fine traditions. It is precisely because of this tradition that our Party has united and led the broad masses of the people to win victory after victory in revolution and construction. If we abandon this tradition, the Party will alienate itself from the masses and lose the support of the people, and the Party's cause will not be successful. Therefore, as early as before the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Mao Zedong warned the whole Party to maintain the spirit of hard work and self-denial. Today, under the new historical conditions of reform and opening up, especially during the rectification and rectification, it is particularly important to emphasize this point. All levels of leading cadres and all Communist Party members should learn from Zhang Wenliang's mistakes, always remember the Party's purpose, work diligently as the people's servants, and establish and carry forward the communist morality of hard work first and enjoyment later, work hard, and devote their whole lives to the Party's cause. At present, all levels of Party organizations should, in the process of strengthening Party style and discipline construction and clean government construction, combine with the actual situation of their regions, departments, and units, take effective measures, and solve the problem of leading cadres building private residences in violation of regulations and renovating houses at a high standard as an important issue to punish corruption and strengthen Party-mass and cadre-mass relations. They should grasp it tightly and effectively, and achieve results. All levels of discipline inspection organs should, under the leadership of the Party committee, actively cooperate and coordinate with relevant supervision and inspection departments to grasp the rectification of the problem of building houses in violation of regulations. Those who seriously abuse their power for personal gain and violate laws and disciplines in the process of building houses must be seriously investigated and dealt with according to Party discipline and state laws, and be severely punished to contribute to the punishment of corruption and the improvement of Party style and clean government construction.

### 中纪委就张文良违纪兴建宿舍楼发出通报  务必保持党的艰苦奋斗作风

    中纪委就张文良违纪兴建宿舍楼发出通报
    务必保持党的艰苦奋斗作风
    新华社北京9月20日电　中共中央纪律检查委员会9月19日以《务必保持党的艰苦奋斗的优良作风》为题，就漳州市委书记张文良违纪兴建独户宿舍楼问题发出通报。
    通报全文如下：
    中共福建省委委员、漳州市委书记张文良，在担任领导职务期间，利用职权，违反规定，挤占机关房屋维修费5.3万余元，为自己兴建独户宿舍楼。特别是当市委领导班子中有同志提出停建，并要求主管的同志将国务院有关规定转告张文良时，张文良仍坚持错误，继续兴建，严重违反了党的纪律。中共福建省纪律检查委员会对张文良同志的问题进行了严肃查处。中共福建省委决定，经中央纪委同意并报中共中央批准，撤销张文良同志中共福建省委委员，漳州市委书记、常委的职务。
    张文良同志作为一个党员领导干部，理应正确运用党和人民赋予的权力，廉洁奉公，艰苦奋斗，为党的事业贡献自己的全部力量。然而，他却辜负了党和人民的期望，把手中的权力当作追求个人享受、搞特殊化的工具，挤占机关巨额房屋维修费为个人营建住宅，严重脱离群众，损害了党的形象。必须指出，类似张文良同志违纪建房的问题并不是个别的，有些地区的党政干部违纪建私房的问题相当严重。有的无视党中央、国务院的三令五申，多占地、占好地，超面积建私房、高标准装修住房；有的损公肥私，任意侵占国家、集体资财，低价购买紧俏建筑材料，无偿使用劳动力和运输工具；有的违反财经纪律，大量借贷、挤占国家资金，甚至挪用专项资金为干部建房发放补助；有的明目张胆地建房出租、转卖、经商，从中牟取非法收入。一些地区的党政干部，不是一心一意地带领群众脱贫致富，而是热衷于营建自己的安乐窝，在群众中造成了很坏的影响。
    党政干部违纪建私房的问题，是当前党风建设和廉政建设中一个突出的问题。党员干部特别是党员领导干部能不能正确处理这个问题，是对其党性坚强与否的一个实际检验。我们的党是全心全意为人民服务的党，艰苦奋斗是党的优良传统。我们党正是依靠这个传统，团结和带领广大人民群众夺取了革命和建设的一个又一个胜利。如果丢掉这个传统，党就会脱离群众，失去人民群众的支持，党的事业就不可能取得成功。因此，早在建国前夕，毛泽东同志就告诫全党，务必保持艰苦奋斗的作风。今天，在改革开放的新的历史条件下，特别是在治理整顿中，突出地强调这一点，尤为重要。各级领导干部和全体共产党员都要从张文良同志的错误中吸取教训，时刻牢记党的宗旨，勤勤恳恳做人民的公仆，树立和发扬吃苦在前、享受在后的共产主义品德，艰苦奋斗，把自己毕生精力奉献给党的事业。当前，各级党组织在加强党风党纪建设和廉政建设的过程中，要结合本地区、本部门和本单位的实际情况，采取有力措施，把解决领导干部违纪建私房和高标准装修住房的问题，作为惩治腐败、密切党群干群关系的一个重要问题，切实抓紧抓好，抓出成效来。各级纪检机关要在党委的领导下，积极协同和配合有关监督监察部门，抓好违纪建房问题的清理工作，对那些在建房中严重以权谋私和违法乱纪的共产党员必须严肃查处，依照党纪国法，给予严厉的制裁，为惩治腐败、搞好党风和廉政建设作出贡献。
