Teaching is an ancient and noble profession. Has it lost its former glory today?

A middle-aged educator lamented, perhaps it was because there was no college entrance examination system at the time, perhaps it was the contrast of hard life during the "Down to the Countryside Movement," or perhaps it was because there were not many jobs to choose from, the teaching profession seemed to be more attractive ten years ago. At that time, if a top high school student was selected to stay in school to teach or work for the Communist Youth League or the Young Pioneers, it was quite enviable. After the nation reached a consensus on "education as the foundation for a hundred-year plan," the teaching profession has not been widely favored in society. So, how do the teachers currently in service view their profession? On the eve of the fifth Teachers' Day, some primary and secondary school teachers in Tianjin shared their views with a reporter, providing new insights.

Wang Shuliang, the principal of Nankai Middle School, told the reporter: The teachers in our school are not like those described in some articles, always thinking about "changing jobs." Except for a few foreign language teachers who are attracted by the high salaries and opportunities to work in foreign-related enterprises or go abroad, there are virtually no cases of "changing jobs." Most teachers, including young teachers, are dedicated to their jobs, and the entire teaching team is stable. Recently, I conducted a survey in the school, and 66% of the teachers feel that being a people's teacher is honorable and proud. Only 1.4% of the teachers have thoughts of leaving the school. Nankai is the alma mater of Premier Zhou, and the school spirit has always been quite upright. Teachers have a strong sense of social responsibility and despise the "money-worshipping" ideology. The more the teachers are like this, the more we, as leaders, must do everything possible to improve the living and working conditions of the teachers. We are working hard to run the school factory, using part of the profits to improve the school's facilities and raise the teachers' welfare. Last year, the average monthly salary of our school's teachers was 123 yuan, and the average bonus was 54 yuan. Everyone is quite satisfied.

Xue Jiping, a teacher at Tianjin No. 2 Middle School, said: I graduated from university in 1959 and have been teaching at No. 2 Middle School for 30 years. If I were to go back to my youth and choose a profession again, I would still choose to be a teacher. Not to mention that the material conditions are not bad compared to other professions, just in terms of spiritual richness, it is unparalleled by any other profession. During festivals and holidays, many of my former students gather at my home. No matter how high their positions are now, they still respect me as they did in the past. Sometimes when walking on the street, I meet former students who call out to me, and when I immediately call out their names, everyone is overjoyed! Some students, when they are in love, bring their partners to my home to seek my advice. Some students, when they get married or have children, also bring candies to visit me. Seeing the former class monitors or "little troublemakers" from my classes getting married and having children, I, as their teacher, feel sweet even if I don't eat the candies. Some people might say: Don't be an idiot! These are all empty things. I want to say: If you don't have this feeling, it's empty, but if you have this feeling, it's not empty.

Tang Xiuhong, a teacher at Hedong Normal School for Early Childhood Education, told the reporter: In 1983, the bureau transferred cadres from the general education system, and some units in the district specifically wanted me, but I declined. I have always liked teaching, and even more so today when the social status of teachers is improving. In terms of political status, the problem of "difficulty in joining the Party" for teachers is being solved. There are many teachers among the people's representatives, political consultants, and government officials. Now, several district mayors in Tianjin were our colleagues a few years ago. In terms of economic status, my husband is a section chief in a government agency, but his income is not as high as mine. I always feel that it is not realistic to ask the state to set aside many other professions that also rely on salaries and to single out teachers to raise their salaries significantly. This is determined by the level of productivity development in our country. Although teachers' remuneration is gradually improving, if someone wants to get rich like an individual business owner, it is better to give up teaching, because that is an impossible thing. Besides, teachers have winter and summer vacations, and can rest at home during the coldest and hottest months of the year, accompanying their children or traveling. This is a privilege that other professions cannot enjoy.

More than 20 senior, middle-aged, and young teachers who talked with the reporter all agreed with this view: The teaching profession, like other professions, has both hardships and joys. In recent years, the proportion of joys has been increasing. It is very necessary for the public opinion to propagate the hardships of teachers and schools to attract attention from all sides and support education. However, long-term "one-sided" public opinion that only reports hardships can easily make those young men and women who want to pursue the teaching profession hesitate; it can make the misconception that "good students do not study education, and those who study education are not good students" occupy an increasingly larger market; it can make those who have just started teaching and those who are studying in normal schools feel ashamed and hopeless. A young male primary school teacher who has been working for a short time said: The more you portray teachers as miserable, the harder it is for me to find a partner. It seems that some people's minds have formed a "teaching profession has no redeeming features" mindset, otherwise why would they not even want to meet someone just because he is a primary school teacher. Little do they know, male teachers are crucial to the healthy development of children's personalities. Someone looking down on my profession only shows their ignorance. I love my job, and as soon as I see the innocent eyes of the children, all my troubles disappear. He suggested that the public opinion should truthfully and objectively tell people about the bitterness, sweetness, and future of the teaching profession. Don't always "complain," making insiders' appetites high and outsiders afraid to stay away.

It is strange that some people, once they start teaching, do not want to change professions, while others do not want to teach at all. The contrast is so great. No one can deny that a specific profession is suitable or not for a specific person, but in the choice of the teaching profession, there seems to be a psychological effect at work. Don't you see that those "hot professions" that young people flock to and strive for are mostly professions with one or more layers of mystery. The vague intuition, with the help of the wings of imagination, is enough to attract the career choices of young people full of vigor. Curiosity drives them to try their hand in a strange and novel environment. The only profession that these young people have directly encountered from kindergarten, primary school, middle school, to university is teaching. Therefore, the teaching profession is familiar to them and has no mystery. Under the subtle influence of this psychological effect, the shortcomings of the teaching profession are magnified, and the advantages are overlooked. In the minds of some young people, the teaching profession is equated with monotony, plainness, hardship, and isolation. While the fate of those "mysterious professions" is the opposite, they are blindly beautified and even elevated in childish imagination. If we set aside this psychological factor, the teaching profession in our country's cities is by no means as bad as to be despised. In fact, the teaching profession, like other professions, has joy and sorrow; it is neither a "flower" nor "tofu dregs." As long as we abandon the outdated prejudice of "having two bushels of grain at home and not being a teacher," and as long as various levels of government and all sectors of society continue to do good things and practical things for schools and teachers, the teaching profession will definitely take its rightful place in people's minds.

### 决不后悔自己的选择——天津市部分中小学教师的职业观

    决不后悔自己的选择
    ——天津市部分中小学教师的职业观
    新华社记者　朱玉泉
    教师，一个古老而崇高的职业，在今天，难道失去了往昔的风采？
    一位中年教育工作者感慨地说，也许是当时没有高考制度，也许是上山下乡艰苦生活的反衬，也许是可供选择的职业不多，十几年前教师职业似乎也比今天“香”。那时候，要是一名高中尖子生被选中留校任教或做共青团、少先队工作，还是很令人们羡慕的。在举国上下有了“百年大计、教育为本”的共识之后，教师职业在社会上却并未得到广泛的青睐。那么在岗的教师们究竟怎样看待自己的职业呢？在第五个教师节的前夕，天津市一些中小学教师在接受记者采访时的回答颇能给人新的启迪。
    南开中学校长王淑玲告诉记者：我们学校的教师不像某些文章所描述的那样，天天想着“跳槽”。除个别外语教师被合资企业、涉外机关的高薪、出国所吸引，有“跳槽”的情况外，绝大多数教师（包括广大青年教师）都安心本职工作，整个教师队伍是稳定的。不久前，我在校内搞过一次问卷调查，有66％的教师觉得当一名人民教师很光荣、很自豪。有离开学校想法的只占教师的1.4％。南开是周总理的母校，校风一直比较正，教师有强烈的社会责任感，鄙视“一切向钱看”的拜金主义思想。教师们越是这样，我们当领导的越要千方百计地改善教师的生活条件和工作条件。我们努力办好校办工厂，用工厂的一部分赢利来改善办学条件，提高教师的福利待遇。去年，我校教师的月平均工资为123元，平均奖金为54元，大家比较满意。
    天津二中薛纪玢教师说：我1959年大学毕业后到二中当教师，一干就是30年。如果让我再回到青年时代选择职业，我还要当教师。且不说物质上比其它行业也穷不到哪里去，单就精神上的富有而言，是其它任何职业所无法相比的。逢年过节，许多我教过的学生纷纷聚会我的家中。不管他们现在职务多高，对我都像当年一样敬重。有时走在马路上，就有我曾教过的学生喊我，当我一下子叫出对方的名字时，大家高兴极啦！还有的学生搞对象，拿不准主意，就带朋友一起来我家，叫老师给“参谋参谋”。有的学生结婚或生小孩了，也带着喜糖来看我。眼瞅着当年的班干部或是“小调皮”成家立业，做了爸爸妈妈，我这当老师的不吃糖心里也甜。可能有人会说：你别阿Q啦！这些都是空的。我要说：你没有这种感受是空的，但有了这种感受就不是空的。
    河东幼儿师范学校唐秀荣老师对记者说：1983年机关从普教系统抽调干部，区里一些单位点名要我，被我谢绝了。我一直很喜欢教师工作，更何况在教师社会地位不断提高的今天呢？论政治地位，教师“入党难”问题正在得到解决。人大代表、政协委员、政府官员中都不乏我们教师。现在天津市的好几位区长几年前就是我们的同行哩。论经济地位，我爱人在政府机关当处长，他的收入还没有我高。我总觉得要求国家抛下许多也是靠工资吃饭的行业，单独把教师的工资提得很高是不现实的。这是由我们国家生产力发展水平决定的。尽管教师待遇在逐步提高，但如果谁一心想像个体户那样发财还是趁早别当教师，因为那是永远不可能的事情。除此之外，教师有寒暑假，在每年最冷和最热的月份都能在家休息，陪孩子玩或外出旅游。这也是其它行业很难享受的。
    与记者交谈的20多位老中青教师，都同意这样的看法：教师职业同其它职业一样，有苦也有乐。近几年来乐的比例正在不断增大。舆论界宣传教师的清苦，学校的艰难，以期引起方方面面的重视，助教育一臂之力，是十分必要的。但是，长期“报忧不报喜”的“一边倒”舆论也容易使那些有志从事教师职业的少男少女们望而却步；反而使“好学生不读师范，读师范的不是好学生”的糊涂认识占有越来越大的市场；使那些刚刚从事教师职业的青年和在学的师范生感到脸上无光，前途无望。一位工作不久的小学男教师说：你越把教师说得惨兮兮的，我越搞不上对象。好像有些人的脑子里已形成一种“教师职业毫无可取之处”的思维定势，要不怎么一听男方是小学教师连面都不想见了。殊不知，男教师对孩子性格的健康发展是至关重要的。有人瞧不起我的职业，只能表明她们的愚昧。我热爱我的工作，我一见到孩子们那一双双天真无邪的眼睛，一切一切的烦恼就都烟消云散了。他建议，舆论界应该把教师职业的苦辣酸甜，把教师职业的今天和明天实事求是地、客观全面地告诉人们。不要总是“诉苦”，把圈里人胃口吊得很高，把圈外人吓得唯恐躲之不及。
    说来奇怪，同是教师职业，有的人干上就不愿改行，有的人说嘛也不愿意干。两者反差如此之大。谁也不能否认特定的职业对于特定的人有适合和不适合之别，但在教师这一职业的选择上似乎还有一种心理效应在起作用。君不见，凡是被青年人趋之若鹜，孜孜以求的“热门职业”，大多是蒙着一层或是几层神秘面纱的行当。朦朦胧胧的直觉借助于想象的翅膀足以吸引血气方刚的青年人的择业取向。好奇心驱使他们跃跃欲试，到一个陌生而新奇的环境里施展一番。而这些青年人从幼儿园小学、中学乃至大学所直接接触的唯一职业便是教师。因此，教师职业对他们来说已无神秘感可言，熟悉得不能再熟悉了。在这种心理效应的潜移默化之下，教师职业的短处被放大了，长处被忽略了。在一些青年的心目中，教师职业与单调、平淡、清苦、闭塞画了等号。而那些“神秘职业”的遭遇则与之相反，在幼稚的想象中被盲目地美化乃至升华。如若抛开这种心理因素，我国城市中的教师职业无论如何也没有糟到令人不屑一顾的境地。事实上，教师职业同其它职业一样，有欢乐，也有苦恼；既不是“一朵花”，更不是
  “豆腐渣”。只要我们抛弃“家有二斗粮，不当孩子王”的陈腐偏见，再加上各级政府和社会各界不断地为学校、为教师办好事、办实事，教师职业在人们心目中一定会取得应有的位置。　（新华社供本报专稿）
