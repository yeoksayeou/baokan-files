The green expanse of Northern China stretches along a 4221-kilometer border that overlaps with the boundaries of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The policy of reform and opening up has enabled the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which boasts the largest land port in the country, Manzhouli, to actively promote national trade development while steadily opening its doors to border trade and economic and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. Currently, Inner Mongolia is gradually forming an open zone in Northern China. In 1988, the total import and export value of border trade in the region reached 140 million Swiss francs, more than 50 times the figure when border trade resumed in 1983. By August this year, the total import and export value of border trade had reached 114.5 million Swiss francs, a 74.73% increase over the same period last year.

Currently, border trade between Inner Mongolia and the Soviet Union and Mongolia has entered a prosperous phase of multi-level development. In addition to the Autonomous Region's International Trade Corporation and other border trade enterprises at the regional and league levels, border counties such as Ergun Right Banner, Chenbaerhu Banner, and Siziwang Banner have established eight border trade enterprises. These enterprises use household appliances, clothing, food, and other light industrial and agricultural products that are in short supply in the Soviet Union and Mongolia to exchange for production materials such as steel, timber, cement, and fertilizers. To meet the needs of trade development, the region is working hard to build the Manzhouli and Erlian ports. Last year, the cargo volume at these two ports increased from 160 million tons in 1983 to over 400 million tons. In April this year, with the approval of the state, the Heishantou and Shive ports in Ergun Right Banner were officially opened. Currently, these two ports are focusing on the construction of basic facilities such as the Ergun River wharf and floating bridge. Among them, the Heishantou port has already started trading with the border town of the Soviet Union. Currently, there are several cargo points for Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian border trade in Hulunbuir League, Xingan League, Xilingol League, and Alxa League, which are under construction.

While continuously developing border trade with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, Inner Mongolia has begun to engage in multi-faceted economic and technological cooperation. Over the past year, Inner Mongolia has signed 23 economic and technological contracts with some regions of the Soviet Union and Mongolia, totaling nearly 200 million Swiss francs. According to the contracts, Inner Mongolia has sent more than 3,000 people to the other side to log burned forests, build projects, and operate joint ventures. Among them, agricultural experts and farmers sent to the high-altitude regions north of 50 degrees north latitude in the Soviet Union's Chita region have produced tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, and lettuce for local residents, earning high praise from local leaders and the public. Currently, Inner Mongolia's trade and economic and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and Mongolia have expanded from the border regions to the hinterlands of the two countries, with trade relations established in more than a dozen states, cities, and regions in the Russian, Ukrainian, and Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republics.

### 我国北方新的开放带正在形成

　　我国北方新的开放带正在形成
    绿色的北方，4221公里的中苏、中蒙边界线与内蒙古自治区的边界相重合。改革开放使拥有满洲里这一全国最大陆运口岸的内蒙古自治区，在积极促进国家贸易发展的同时，稳步敞开与苏联和蒙古边境贸易和经济技术合作的门户。现在，内蒙古正逐步形成中国北方的开放带。去年，全区边境贸易进出口总额为1.4亿瑞士法郎，比边贸恢复时的1983年增长50多倍。今年到8月中旬，边贸进出口总额达11450万瑞士法郎，比去年同期又增长74.73％。
    现在，内蒙古与苏联和蒙古的边境贸易已出现多层次发展的繁荣局面。除自治区国际贸易总公司等一批自治区和盟的边贸企业外，额尔古纳右旗、陈巴尔虎旗、四子王旗等边境旗县相继创建了8家边贸企业。这些企业用家用电器、服装、食品等苏蒙短缺的轻工和农副产品，换回钢材、木材、水泥、化肥等生产资料。为满足贸易发展的要求，自治区努力抓好满洲里、二连两个口岸的建设。去年两个口岸的进出口货运量已由1983年的160余万吨增加到400余万吨。今年4月经国家批准，正式开放了额尔古纳右旗的黑山头和室韦两个口岸。目前这两个口岸正在抓紧进行额尔古纳河码头和浮箱桥等基础设施的建设。其中黑山头口岸已经开始与苏联边境城镇过货。现在还有呼伦贝尔盟、兴安盟、锡林郭勒盟、阿拉善盟等地几个苏蒙边境贸易的过货点，正在作筹建工作。
    内蒙古在与苏联、蒙古不断发展边境贸易的同时，开始进行多方面的经济技术合作。一年多来，内蒙古先后与苏联和蒙古的一些地区签定23项经济技术合同，总金额近2亿瑞士法郎。按合同规定，内蒙古目前已派出3000多人到对方采伐过火林木、承建工程、办合资企业。其中派出的农艺专家和菜农在北纬50°以北的苏联赤塔州的高寒地区，为当地居民生产出西红柿、黄瓜、菠菜、莴苣等蔬菜，受到苏方当地领导和群众的高度赞扬。现在，内蒙古与苏联和蒙古的贸易和经济技术合作，已由边境地区向两国腹地扩展，其中在苏联已与俄罗斯、乌克兰、哈萨克等加盟共和国的十几个州、市和地区建立了贸易关系。
