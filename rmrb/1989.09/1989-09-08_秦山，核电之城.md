In the vicinity of Hangzhou Bay in Haiyan County, a nuclear power city has risen from the ground. A 70-meter-high nuclear reactor containment shell stands tall beside Qin Mountain, and various main and auxiliary equipment are being installed with great haste. A workforce of 4,000 is working day and night. It is expected that by next year, Qin Mountain will be able to supply nuclear power to the country for the first time. Qin Mountain, this ancient peak named after the Emperor Qin's visit, is now renowned worldwide for being the site of China's first self-designed and constructed nuclear power plant!

In 1964, the first mushroom cloud rose over the Chinese mainland, turning the mysterious dream of the atomic bomb into a reality. The descendants of the Yellow Emperor were all invigorated!

However, after several years, the shadow of backward nuclear technology once again weighed heavily on the hearts of the Chinese people: while more than 600 nuclear power plants stood tall around the world, the Chinese mainland remained a blank. People were anxious and struggling, awaiting the second high note of China's nuclear industry. Who would lead this nuclear power endeavor?

In the early 1970s, Premier Zhou had personally approved the development of our own nuclear power. However, the great man passed away, and the cause was left unfinished. It was not until December 1982 that a generation of nuclear technology experts, riding the winds of reform, came from the northwestern desert to Qin Mountain by Hangzhou Bay to start the second phase of the nuclear industry.

A great undertaking for the ages, now begun. From the Premier to the common people, how many hearts are tied to nuclear power, how many minds are connected to Qin Mountain. Li Peng, who was once an electrical expert, has visited Qin Mountain three times, pointing out the grand blueprint.

A nuclear power plant includes more than 30 main and auxiliary technology systems and 170 supporting systems, involving nearly 20 different fields. The scientific research and design of the nuclear power plant has almost gathered all the technical elites in the country. Through several winters and summers, without calculating the rewards, they have focused on overcoming 380 scientific research projects. Hundreds of enterprises and tens of thousands of technical backbones have sincerely cooperated and striven for excellence.

The research and development have taken a gratifying step forward, but the construction faces numerous difficulties. Take the welding of the main pipeline of the reactor, for example. Even abroad, it is said that only "divine welders" can handle it. There is no precedent for such technology in China. Consulting with a certain country, they demanded 80,000 US dollars upfront, along with many stringent requirements. The builders of the nuclear power plant vowed: we will overcome all difficulties and pass this test! Countless experiments and breakthroughs, welding with meticulous care, resulting in flawless outcomes. Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency, after conducting a safety review of the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant before its full operation, praised: "China is capable of nuclear power construction." In 1983, the International Atomic Energy Agency conference added the sacred name "China" among the original 12 permanent members.

### 秦山，核电之城

    秦山，核电之城
    在杭州湾畔的海盐县境内，一座核电城拔地而起，70多米高的核反应堆安全壳已耸立在秦山身边，各种主辅设备正加紧安装，4000建设大军夜以继日工作。预计明年，秦山将可为祖国大地第一次输出核能电力。秦山，这座历史上因秦皇登临而遂有其名的古老山峰，而今则以我国第一座设计建造的核电站而名扬四海！
    1964年，中华大地上升腾起第一朵蘑菇状云团，原子弹这个神秘的梦幻在中国变成了现实。炎黄子孙，莫不振奋！
    但是，几度春秋，核技术落后的阴影又重压中国人心头：当世界上矗立起600余座核电站的时候，中国大陆却依然是一片空白。人们在焦虑和奋斗中期待中国核工业的第二曲高歌。核电伟业，谁主其成？
    70年代初，周总理曾亲自审定，搞自己的核电。然而伟人早去，事业未竟。直至1982年12月，一代核科技专家才乘着改革春风，从西北戈壁滩来到杭州湾畔的秦山，安营扎寨，开始核工业的第二次创业。
    千秋伟业，而今始举，从国家总理到布衣百姓，多少人情系核电，心连秦山。曾经是电力专家的李鹏总理，就三临秦山，指点宏图。
    一座核电站包含了30多个主辅工艺技术系统、170多个配套系统，那是一项牵涉到近20个专业的宏大科技工程。核电站科研设计几乎汇聚了全国所有有关的技术精英。几度寒暑，不计报酬，重点攻克了380项之多的科研项目。几百家企业和上万名技术骨干真诚合作，孜孜以求。
    研制迈出了可喜一步，建造又难关重重。单说反应堆主管路的焊接，在国外都是非“神仙焊手”莫属，我国尚无这种工艺先例。向某国咨询，对方开口就要8万美金，还另附许多苛刻的要求。核电建设者们发誓：力排万难，闯下此关！无数次的试验攻关，焊接一丝不苟，结果万无一失。国际原子能机构有关人士在对秦山核电站全面运行前进行安全评审后称赞：“中国，是能够胜任核电建设的。”1983年国际原子能机构会议在原12个常任理事国中，重重地添上“中国”这个神圣的名字。（俞文明）（附图片）
