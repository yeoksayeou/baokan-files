Shandong Province has selected outstanding technical talents, pioneering a new path to motivate intellectuals, "setting a good example nationwide" (the newspaper reported on this topic on July 5, 1989, on the fifth page). Today, the more than 2,000 outstanding individuals active in various industries across the province have shown how they performed in the severe political struggle against the turmoil. The investigation materials from the Provincial Party Committee's Organization Department tell us: the vast majority of these outstanding talents have withstood the test and are indeed a group of morally and intellectually excellent intellectuals.

During the turmoil, they calmly analyzed and understood the situation, firmly believed in the Party's leadership, and maintained political consistency with the Central Committee. Many outstanding talents expressed doubts from the beginning of the protests and demonstrations. Famous young writer Zhang Wei said: "I do not support the radical actions of parading, demonstrations, and hunger strikes. Such actions can only make things worse." Many outstanding talents expressed great indignation at the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, exposing and condemning the few who, under the pretext of "anti-corruption," attempted to overthrow the Party's leadership and the socialist system. Ninety-seven outstanding talents working in colleges and universities, especially those in leadership positions, did a lot of hard work in very difficult circumstances to stop the turmoil. Pan Chengdong, the president and professor of Shandong University, Guan Meigu, the president and professor of Shandong Normal University, Wang Tingqi, the president and researcher of Shandong Medical University, and Lu Xiyue, the vice-president and professor of Shandong Institute of Economics, firmly executed the instructions from the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, actively engaged in dialogues with students, visited dormitories, and made every effort to ensure the normal order of the schools. Outstanding talents in universities in cities like Qingdao were not disturbed by external factors and continued teaching as long as there was one student. In enterprises, outstanding talents all stood firm at their posts. Many comrades worked despite illness, demonstrating a firm political stance and high political awareness.

In this struggle, the Shandong Provincial Organization Department at various levels paid great attention to examining and understanding the political and ideological performance of outstanding talents in stopping the turmoil through various means, and actively did a good job in education and guidance. The Provincial Party Committee's Organization Department held three consecutive symposiums with outstanding talents from different units, professions, and ages, studying speeches by central leaders, especially deeply studying Deng Xiaoping's speeches, to understand the root cause, nature of this struggle, and the correctness of the measures taken by the Central Committee. During the study, many outstanding talents were moved to tears when they heard Deng Xiaoping say that "one central task and two basic points" would not change and that reform and opening up would continue. Some comrades said, "It was Deng Xiaoping who proposed 'respecting knowledge and respecting talents'; it was Deng Xiaoping who pointed out that intellectuals are part of the working class. We will never forget Deng Xiaoping's concern for intellectuals." Everyone expressed: In the future, we will more consciously maintain consistency with the Central Committee in political actions, adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and continue to firmly implement "one central task and two basic points" to contribute to the construction and reform of the entire province.

    经得起考验的拔尖人才
    ——山东省调查二千多名省级业务尖子在动乱中的表现
    钟志
    山东省组织部门选拔专业技术拔尖人才，开创调动知识分子积极性的新路子，“在全国带了个好头”（本报1989年7月5日第五版曾作专题报道）。今天，活跃在全省各行各业的2000多名业务尖子们，在反对动乱的严峻政治斗争中表现如何呢？省委组织部的调查材料告诉人们：这些拔尖人才中的绝大多数经受住了考验，不愧为一批德才兼备的优秀知识分子。
    在动乱期间，他们冷静地分析和认识形势，坚信党的领导，在政治上同党中央保持一致。不少拔尖人才在一开始出现游行示威时就表示疑义。著名年轻作家张炜说：
  “我不赞成游行示威、静坐绝食的过激行动，这样做只能把事情搞糟。”不少拔尖人才对北京发生的反革命暴乱表示了极大的愤慨，揭露和斥责极少数人打着“反官倒”、
  “反腐败”的幌子，妄图推翻党的领导和社会主义制度的罪恶阴谋。97名在大专院校工作的拔尖人才，特别是担任领导职务的同志，在十分困难的情况下，为制止动乱做了大量艰苦的工作。山东大学校长、教授潘承洞，山东师范大学校长、教授管梅谷，山东医科大学校长、研究员王廷础，山东经济学院副院长、教授卢希悦等，坚决执行中央、省委指示，积极与学生对话，到宿舍做工作，为保证学校正常秩序尽了最大努力。青岛等市地高校的拔尖人才不受外界干扰，只要有一个学生，也坚持上课。企业中的拔尖人才，个个坚守岗位，不少同志带病工作，表现了坚定的政治立场和高度的政治觉悟。
    在这次斗争中，主管全省拔尖人才工作的山东省各级组织部门十分重视通过多种方式考察了解拔尖人才在制止动乱中的思想政治表现，积极做好教育、引导工作。省委组织部连续召开了三次不同单位、专业、年龄的拔尖人才座谈会，与他们共同学习中央领导同志的讲话，特别是深入学习小平同志的讲话，认识这场斗争的根源、性质和中央所采取措施的正确性。在学习中，不少拔尖人才听到小平同志讲“一个中心、两个基本点”不变，坚持把改革开放搞下去时，激动得流下了热泪。有的同志说，是小平同志提出“尊重知识、尊重人才”的；是小平同志指出知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，我们对小平同志关心知识分子的功德永志不忘。大家表示：今后要更加自觉地在政治上行动上与党中央保持一致，坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，继续坚定不移地贯彻“一个中心、两个基本点”，为搞好全省建设和改革作贡献。
