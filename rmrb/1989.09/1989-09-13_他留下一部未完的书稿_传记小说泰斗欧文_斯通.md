August 26th, the renowned American writer Irving Stone, known for his historical biographical novels, passed away in a medical center in Los Angeles.

At the age of eighty-six, he left behind an unfinished manuscript. Throughout his life, Stone published a total of twenty-seven biographical novels. These works were bestsellers worldwide, translated into dozens of languages, and sold thirty million copies globally. Five of his works were also adapted into films.

Stone combined biography and fiction, becoming the master of biographical novels worldwide. Through meticulous on-site investigations, thorough research, and his extraordinary artistic imagination, biographical novels flourished under his pen, becoming a widely beloved genre among readers.

In 1929, shortly after graduating from college, Irving arrived in Paris. At the urging of a friend, he visited the Luxembourg Gallery, where seventy to eighty oil paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh were on display. He was astonished by the "chaotic world of colors, sunlight, and movement." The "great and sublime unity" formed by people, plants, and animals organically blending together deeply moved Stone. In the face of scarce textual records, he carried a travel bag, tracing Van Gogh's footsteps, and visited Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, seeking the precise locations where nature was transformed into immortal art. He spent two years conducting on-site investigations to gather materials and another half year revising the manuscript four times before finally completing the Van Gogh biography, *Lust for Life*.

However, to get the manuscript published, he spent another three years visiting seventeen major publishing houses in New York and Boston, only to be rejected by all. The reason given was the same: "How can we expect Americans, who are in the midst of the Great Depression, to accept the story of an obscure Dutch painter?" It was his then-fiancée Jean who edited the manuscript, removing one-tenth of its content, before the Green division of the British Longman publishing company reluctantly accepted it for publication.

No one could have imagined that this book, which was rejected by so many and finally published in 1934 after much struggle, would become his breakthrough work. That same year, he used the royalties from the book to marry Jean. From then on, this life partner became his trusted assistant in his career. For fifty-five years, she served as the editor of Stone's works. No one could have imagined that this book, which initially had a print run of only five thousand copies, now has dozens of translations, including a Chinese version, and has sold twenty-five million copies.

Even in his later years, when writing the biography of Darwin, *The Origin*, Stone lived in the residence of this famous evolutionist, walking countless times on the paths Darwin had walked, pondering the gestation process of the theory of evolution. His final work, *The Depths of Glory*, published in 1985, is about the French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro. Despite his advanced age and frail health, he insisted on revisiting the rivers and farms the painter had depicted, visiting his studio, and seeking to capture the protagonist's feelings at the time. He demanded of himself not only to recreate historical facts but also to vividly depict the inner world and appearance of the characters. For decades, he adhered to this rigorous working style.

Over the course of sixty years, his twenty-seven monumental works covered a wide range of figures. Among them were artists such as Michelangelo (*The Agony and the Ecstasy*), the American expatriate painter John Singer Sargent (*The Passionate Journey*), and the Italian Renaissance sculptor and painter Michelangelo (*The Agony and the Ecstasy*). He wrote about politicians like U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (*The President's Lady*) and American labor leader and founder of the Socialist Party Eugene V. Debs (*The Passionate Journey*). He also wrote about the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud (*The Passionate Journey*) and the American writer Jack London (*Sailor on Horseback*), among others. In his selection of subjects, he said he favored those who had been misunderstood and distorted in the past. He also enjoyed exploring the role and influence of women in men's lives and careers.

Why did he become captivated by the genre of biographical novels? He said:

"Biographical novels focus on a single person. The author, me, spends two to five years and becomes the protagonist of the book. After writing two or three pages, I forget my own name, don't know where I live, what work I do, or what era I am in. I become the master of the book, living in this book."

His wife Jean, who lived with him for fifty-five years, said after his death: "The only thing he wanted to do was write books. He wrote all his life. He was glad that he left so many books. Whether people call his works biographical novels or novel biographies, he established a unique genre, and he succeeded."

### 他留下一部未完的书稿——传记小说泰斗欧文·斯通

　　他留下一部未完的书稿
    ——传记小说泰斗欧文·斯通
　　曹玉如
    八月二十六日，以写历史名人传记小说著称于当今世界的美国作家欧文·斯通，在洛杉矶一家医疗中心病故。
    他在走完八十六年的生活历程时，留下了一部尚未完成的书稿。斯通一生总共出版了二十七部传记小说。这些作品畅销世界，被译成几十种文字，在全球发行了三千万册。其中五部作品还搬上了银幕。
    斯通把传记和小说结合起来，成了世界传记小说的泰斗。详尽的实地考察，认真的调查研究，加上作家非凡的艺术想象，传记小说在斯通笔下才得以发扬光大，成为一种广为读者喜爱的文体。
    一九二九年，刚离大学校门不久的欧文来到巴黎，在朋友的怂恿下，参观了卢森堡画廊。这里展出的是荷兰画家梵高的七八十幅油画。他被那“色采、阳光和运动组成的骚乱不安的世界惊呆了”。那些“由人、植物、动物有机地溶合在一起组成的一个伟大崇高的统一体”，深深地打动了斯通的心。在文字记载少得可怜的情况下，他肩背旅行袋，追踪梵高的足迹，访遍了英国、比利时、荷兰和法国，寻觅那些将大自然变成不朽艺术的确切位置。他实地考察两年搜集材料，又费时半年四易其稿，终于写成梵高传《渴望生活》。
    但为了让书稿与读者见面，他整整花了三年时间，跑遍了纽约和波士顿的十七家大出版公司，竟悉遭拒绝，理由是同样的：怎能要求我们让处于大萧条时期的美国人接受一个默默无闻的荷兰画家的故事呢？”是他当时的未婚妻琼把手稿删去了十分之一，英国的朗曼出版公司格林分公司才勉强接受予以发表。
    谁也不曾想到这本磨破鞋底无人要，历尽周折于一九三四年问世的梵高传记，竟成了他的成名之作，同年，他还用这笔稿酬与琼结了婚。从此以后，这个生活中的恋人一直是他事业上的好帮手。五十五年来，她一直担任斯通作品的编辑。人们也不曾想到这本最初只发行五千册的梵高传现在已有了包括中译本在内的几十种译本，已发行二千五百万册。
    直至晚年，斯通在写达尔文传《起源》时，仍住进这位著名的进化论作者的故居，无数次漫步于达尔文走过的小道上，揣摸进化论的孕育过程。他的最后一部作品，一九八五年出版的《荣誉的深度》写的是法国印象派画家毕沙罗。他不顾自己年迈体弱，硬是重游了画家画过的河流、农场，参观他的画室，以寻求主人公当时的感觉。他要求自己不仅要再现史实，还要形象地写出人物的内心世界和音容笑貌。数十年来他一直遵循这一严谨的工作作风。
    整整六十年里，他出的二十七部宏篇巨著涉及到各种人物。其中有写艺术家的，除梵高和毕沙罗外，还有意大利文艺复兴时期的雕塑家兼画家米开朗琪罗（《痛楚与狂喜》）、美国流亡画家约翰·诺贝尔（《激动人心的旅程》）；他写政治家如美国总统林肯（《爱情是永恒的》），美国劳工领袖、社会主义党创始人尤金·维·德布斯（《家中的对手》）；也写奥地利心理学家弗洛伊德（《心灵的激情》），还写美国作家杰克·伦敦（《马背上的水手》）等等，在选材方面，他说自己偏爱那些过去被误解和歪曲的人物。他还喜欢探讨妇女在男人的生活和事业中的地位和影响。
    为什么会迷上传记小说这种文体？他说：
  “传记小说只涉及一个人。作者，我，花上二到五年时间，便成了书中的主人公。写上两三页后，我会忘了自己的姓名，不知道自己住在何处，干何种工作，处于什么年代。我变成书中的主人，生活在这本书里。”
    与他共同生活了五十五年的妻子琼在他去世后说：“他唯一想做的事情就是写书。他毕生写作，他感到欣慰的是，自己留下了那么多书。不管人们称他的作品为传记小说，还是小说传记，他树立了与众不同的文体，他取得了成功。”
