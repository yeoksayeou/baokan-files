40 years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, as one of the founding leaders, wrote the following inscription at the founding ceremony: "Forever remember that in the long, arduous years of the past, the people's heroes exchanged their blood for today's victory."

Today, as we finally complete a grand historical film, *The Founding Ceremony*, which reenacts the birth of the Republic in its difficult early years, we want to say the same words that Comrade Deng Xiaoping wrote back then.

Time flies like an arrow, and the years flow like a river. Over the past 40 years, China's appearance has undergone a fundamental transformation. We are no longer a poor and backward "Sick Man of East Asia," nor are we a dependent vassal of Europe and America. We have become a great socialist country that is politically independent and self-reliant, economically self-sufficient, and culturally unique. We are raising the banner of socialist civilization, striving to achieve the great rejuvenation of the nation, and at the same time, we are playing an increasingly significant role in the direction of world civilization. I think it is necessary to propose to all those who wish for the country's development and progress and who do not harbor prejudices against social and political issues: Reflecting on history and drawing lessons from it can make one wise and resolute.

The significance of the film *The Founding Ceremony* lies in its artistic retelling of the Republic's difficult early years. For those who were born or grew up after the founding of the Republic, revisiting the historic changes that took place on the land of our motherland will be quite novel. They will gain a spiritual pleasure, and the film's ideological and cognitive value will be fully realized.

Roughly speaking, I think *The Founding Ceremony* has two aspects of ideological and cognitive value that are worth our attention.

First, it vividly portrays the founding atmosphere of the People's Republic.

1949 was a year of turning points and new beginnings in Chinese history. During the process of reform and innovation, a series of major political and military struggles took place. The film pays attention to the different perspectives from which various political forces view the impending birth of the People's Republic. First, there is the American Ambassador Stuart, who has already realized that the Chinese Communists will not obey anyone. Then, there is the Soviet Chairman Stalin sending a special envoy to Xibaipo to listen to the explanations of the Chinese comrades. At this time, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly announces that New China will follow the socialist and communist path under the leadership of the Communist Party, and at the same time points out that China's development will be based on its actual situation and have its own characteristics. Later, Zhang Zhongming's lines express a democratic person's expectations for the new government led by the Communist Party. And Chairman Mao says: I sincerely invite you to join us in ruling the country (in the scene where he talks to Zhang Shizhao, he explains that the "romantic figures" refer to the people, does Mr. Zhang not want to be one of the romantic figures?). This shows that the new people's government is a revolutionary government led by the Communist Party, which unites the broadest masses of the people to exercise dictatorship over a small number of reactionaries. Until the end of the film, when the climax of the founding ceremony appears, Chairman Mao repeatedly shouts the slogan "Long live the people" to the tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the audience, which concentrates the expression that the birth of New China marks the beginning of a new era where the people are the masters, which is the founding atmosphere that the film strives to depict for our Eastern socialist power.

Of course, building socialism in China is by no means an easy task. The overthrown reactionary forces are not willing to admit defeat, and this is reflected in many ways in the film. Even within the people, the ideological preparation for the new socialist era is not sufficient. The film describes the villagers of Shaoshan saying: "This land is now ruled by the Maos," which is an example. As the leader of the people, Chairman Mao was aware of such problems at the time, so while leading the strategic pursuit and annihilation of the reactionaries, he also paid great attention to the educational work within the revolutionary ranks. He, together with Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Ren Bishi, devoted themselves to laying the material and theoretical foundations for the construction of New China. The film uses heavy colors to depict Chairman Mao delivering a report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and his conversation with Zhang Zhongming, directly leading to his important theoretical article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." These all clearly indicate that the founding atmosphere is not just a celebration of victory but also the beginning of a new and more arduous struggle.

At the end of the film, superimposed with fireworks is the scene of the People's Liberation Army bravely fighting and shedding blood and the broad masses of the people enthusiastically supporting the front. This, of course, is a direct reminder to people not to forget the precious sacrifices made for the birth of New China. And when we watch these scenes of blood and fire now, we think of how we should not let down the martyrs, how we should defend the People's Republic they shed blood for, and how we should adhere to the socialist direction of New China planned by our predecessors...

We have read from ancient historical records such as the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Book of Han* about the founding of some feudal dynasties. Those changes of dynasties cannot be compared with the founding atmosphere of our People's Republic. The preface of the film points out this historical truth, and the entire film vividly embodies this truth, making it a remarkable success.

Second, it accurately portrays the typical image of Chairman Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader.

Portraying the image of the people's leader and accurately reflecting the leadership core of the Chinese Communist Party at that time is an important task facing the film *The Founding Ceremony*.

I will only talk about the portrayal of Chairman Mao's image here. Undoubtedly, he appears like the North Star in the sky, surrounded by stars. The film has poured a great deal of enthusiasm into portraying Chairman Mao, using many major events and minor details to create a deep impression. It can be said that the director has drawn on the conventional methods of Chinese historical literature, using minor behaviors to depict the mental state of a great figure in a great event, achieving the effect of a vivid image with little ink.

For example, before and after the grand scene of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the film designs a scene where Chairman Mao jokes with his comrades and subordinates over a pack of cigarettes. Again, he goes to the streets of Beiping with his bodyguard to check on the people's situation, eats mutton and noodles but has no money to pay, and later apologizes to the comrades in the Secretariat for this incident. These details reveal the innocent and simple inner world of a great man and also depict the good atmosphere of unity and cooperation within the leadership core of the Chinese Communist Party.

I think that in the portrayal of Chairman Mao's image, the most important thing is to indicate that he is the undisputed leader of the Chinese revolution. The film writes about many battles and frontline commanders and regional commanders, but everyone can clearly see that the undisputed strategist is Chairman Mao. In the scene where the Secretariat meets, Chairman Mao talks about the construction of Beijing, expressing some views that may not seem very appropriate now, but at that time, his way of speaking reflected a spirit of creating a new socialist industrial civilization, which is the posture of a leader with a far-reaching vision.

The film especially portrays Chairman Mao's sense of responsibility and governing consciousness as a leader. After laying the foundation for the Monument to the People's Heroes, he returns to his residence, facing the simple food he is used to but cannot eat, thinking of the thousands of martyrs who have sacrificed their lives, thinking of the heavy responsibility of leading a great country on his shoulders, he tells his son, "Of course, I am happy, but my mood has never been so heavy." He hopes that "all revolutionary cadres across the country will forever maintain the hardworking spirit that the cadres in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region possessed over the past decade or so," and when the newly born republic faces the threat of imperialist aggression, he sends his son to the front line, sacrificing another family member for the future of New China. Seeing such a scene, people cannot help but be moved. A great leader, no matter how serious his mistakes were later (which is related to his deviation from the understanding of the laws of China's construction), but his contributions and sacrifices for the liberation of the Chinese people and the future of the entire Chinese nation are not forever worthy of our remembrance? Therefore, the portrayal of Chairman Mao's image in *The Founding Ceremony* will also have permanent artistic value.

The great achievements of the film *The Founding Ceremony* in terms of ideology and art are, of course, not limited to the above two aspects. As the opposite side of the revolutionary camp, the portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek's image is also quite outstanding. Due to space limitations, I cannot write more here. In the history of Chinese films, a work that describes such a major historical event and portrays so many historical figures, *The Founding Ceremony* is a pioneering effort. Precisely because of this, its achievements, experiences, and inevitable shortcomings are all worth our serious study.

Two years ago, I went to Shanghai to participate in a grand exhibition of the film *Song of the Battle Flag*. I said: "Our era requires a breakthrough in major theme films, and our various conditions are gradually maturing, making such a new breakthrough fully possible." The appearance of films such as *The Founding Ceremony*, *Perpetual Kunlun*, and *Baise Uprising* proves that my expectation for the breakthrough in the creation of major theme films has not been in vain. I believe that if we persist, two years later, we will continue to see new breakthroughs in the film *The Great Battle*.

Forever remember the sacrifices of the martyrs!

Reflecting on history will make us all wise and resolute.

### 回顾历史使我们明智坚定——谈影片《开国大典》

    回顾历史使我们明智坚定
    ——谈影片《开国大典》
    陈昊苏
    40年前，邓小平同志做为开国元勋之一，在开国大典上曾写下这样的题词：
    “永远铭记着，在过去长期艰难的岁月里，人民英雄用自己的鲜血，才换得了今天的胜利。”
    今天，当我们终于完成了一部再现共和国于艰难岁月中诞生的大型历史影片《开国大典》的时候，我们想要说的话，正好就是邓小平同志当年写下的这个题词。
    逝者如斯，岁月如流。40年来中国的面貌发生了根本的改观。再不是贫穷落后的东亚病夫，再不是仰人鼻息的欧美附庸。我们已经是政治上独立自主、经济上自力更生、文化上独树一帜的伟大的社会主义国家。我们正在高举社会主义文明的旗帜，努力实现伟大的民族复兴，同时也对世界文明的走向发挥着越来越重大的影响。我觉得现在有必要向一切热望国家发展进步而对社会政治问题不怀偏见的善良的人们提出：时时回顾历史并从中吸取教益，是可以使自己变得明智和坚定的。
    影片《开国大典》的意义，就是对40年前共和国艰难草创的历史作了一番富于艺术色彩的回顾。重温一下当年发生在祖国大地的历史性巨变，共和国成立以后出生或成长起来的人都会感到很新鲜，他们将获得一种精神上的愉悦享受，而影片的思想认识价值就在这里得以充分发挥出来。
    粗略地讲，我认为《开国大典》的思想认识价值有两个方面值得我们重视。
    第一，比较深刻地表现出人民共和国的开国气象。
    1949年是中国历史上转折与开创的年代。在革故鼎新的过程中，发生了一系列重大的政治军事斗争。影片注意了从不同侧面来表现各种政治力量对即将诞生的人民共和国怀着怎样的期待。首先是美国大使司徒雷登对中国共产党人的猜测，他已经明白，他们将不会听命于任何人。接着是苏联主席斯大林派特使只带耳朵到西柏坡来听取中国同志的说明。这时候毛泽东同志庄严宣布，新中国将在共产党的领导下走社会主义共产主义的道路，同时也指出，中国的发展将按中国的实际情况办事而具有自己的特点。后来，张治中的一段台词表达了一位民主人士对共产党领导的新政权的企盼。而毛主席则说：我是诚心诚意地请你和我们一起坐天下（在与章士钊谈话那场戏中他解释说，风流人物是指的人民，章先生难道不愿意做风流人物之一吗？）。表明了新生的人民政权是在共产党领导下，团结最广大的人民群众对极少数的反动分子实行专政的革命政权。直至影片结尾出现开国大典的最高潮，毛主席连续不断地对全场几十万军民高呼“人民万岁”的口号，集中地表达出新中国的诞生是开始了一个人民当家做主的新时代，这就是影片所要着力刻画的我们这个东方社会主义大国的开国气象。
    当然，在中国建设社会主义，远不是轻而易举的事。被推翻的反动势力绝不甘心失败，这一点在影片中有许多表现。即使在人民内部，对于新的社会主义时代的思想准备也是不充分的。影片描写韶山冲的老乡说：这江山让我们姓毛的坐了，就是一个例子。做为人民的领袖，毛主席当时对这样的问题是有清醒认识的，所以他在领导部署对反动派进行战略追歼的同时，也极端重视革命队伍内部的教育工作，他和刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、任弼时等同志一起致力于为新中国的建设奠定物质的和思想理论的基础。影片用浓重的色彩表现毛主席在党的七届二中全会上作报告，还写了他和张治中的谈话，直接引出他的重要理论文章《论人民民主专政》。这些都清楚地指明，开国气象并不仅仅是胜利的欢庆，同时包含着新的更加艰巨的斗争的开始。
    在影片结尾处与礼花焰火叠印在一起的是解放军英勇作战流血牺牲和广大人民群众踊跃支前的场面，这当然是直接提醒人们不要忘记为新中国的诞生而付出的那些宝贵的牺牲。而我们现在观看这些血与火的画面时，联想到的是我们不能愧对先烈，应该保卫他们流血牺牲换来的人民共和国，应该坚持前人所规划的新中国的社会主义的方向……
    我们曾从《史记》《汉书》等古代史籍中读到一些封建王朝的创业，那些改朝换代是无法和我们人民共和国的开国气象相比较的。影片的前言点出了这个历史的真理，而全片则比较出色地体现了这个真理，因而是一个了不起的成功。
    第二，比较准确地塑造出毛泽东主席这一革命领袖人物的典型形象。
    塑造人民领袖的形象，同时准确表现当时中国共产党的领导核心集体，这是影片《开国大典》所面对的重要课题。
    我这里只说对毛主席的形象塑造。无疑，他像众星环绕的北斗一样出现天穹的正面。影片对毛主席这个人物倾注了极大的热情，通过许多大的事件小的细节来表现，给人留下较深刻的印象。应该说导演吸取了中国历史文学中惯用的手法，借助于细节的行为来刻画伟大人物在伟大事件中的心态，取得笔墨不多费而形象鲜明的效果。例如在七届二中全会的大场面前后，设计了毛主席为了一包香烟而与战友部属谈笑风生的情节。又如他带着警卫员到北平街头去查看民情，吃羊肉泡馍却没有钱付账，后来还为了这件事向书记处同志作检讨。这些细节表现了一个伟大人物天真质朴的内心世界，也渲染出中国共产党的领导核心集体的团结与合作的良好气氛。
    我认为，在毛主席这个形象的把握上，最重要的还是要指明他是中国革命胜利的当之无愧的领袖。影片中写了许多战役，写了前线指挥员和战区指挥员，但是大家都看得很清楚，战略上无可争议的统帅是毛主席。在书记处碰头的那场戏里，毛主席畅谈北京市的建设问题，他发表了一些见解，现在看起来未必都很妥当，但当时那种讲法却体现出一种创造新的社会主义工业文明的气魄，是一个领袖高瞻远瞩的姿态。
    影片特别表现了毛主席作为领袖的责任感与执政意识。在为人民英雄纪念碑奠基之后，他回到住处，面对往常用惯了的简单饭食却吃不下去，他想到了成千成万牺牲了的烈士，他想到压在自己肩上的领导一个伟大国家的重任，他对自己的儿子说，“当然高兴，但心情却从来没有这样沉重。”他希望“全国一切革命工作人员永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风”，而当新生的共和国面对帝国主义侵略威胁的时候，他把自己的儿子送上前线，为了新中国的未来又奉献了一位亲人。看到这样的场面人们是不能不为之感动的。一位伟大的领袖，不管他在后来犯了怎样严重的错误（这与他对中国建设规律的认识发生偏差有关），但他为中国人民的解放事业及整个中华民族的未来所作出的贡献和牺牲，不是永远值得我们纪念吗？《开国大典》中对于毛主席形象的塑造也因而将具有永久的艺术价值。
      《开国大典》这部巨片在思想艺术等方面取得的成功，当然不止上述两个方面。做为革命阵营的对立面，蒋介石形象的刻画也相当出色。限于篇幅，我在这里不能多写。在中国电影史上，一部作品描写如此重大的历史事件、表现如此众多的历史人物，《开国大典》堪称创举。唯其如此，它的成就、经验以及尚不可避免存在的不足之处，都很值得我们认真研究。
    两年前我曾到上海去参加一次规模盛大的《军旗颂》影展。我曾说：“我们的时代要求重大题材影片出现新的突破，而我们各方面的条件逐步走向成熟，这种新的突破完全具备了客观的可能。”《开国大典》以及《巍巍昆仑》、《百色起义》等影片的出现，证明我对重大题材影片创作取得突破的期望并没有落空。我想，只要我们坚持下去，两年以后将从影片
  《大决战》中继续看到更新的突破。
    永远铭记着先烈们的牺牲吧！
    回顾历史将使我们大家明智和坚定。
