Life is art. Art moves towards life, and life becomes art. This is the new concept of modern environmental art. Art should not be a mere plaything in an ivory tower but should be participated in by the masses and integrated into every aspect of life. The most closely related to human life is the dwelling. A person spends nearly two-thirds of their life within it. If a dwelling can embody artistic pursuits, how enchanting that dream would be.

Just as people complain that dwellings lack character, to the point where children can't find their way home from school, Professor Lü Junhua of the Architecture Department at Tsinghua University has presented a gift to the masses, a gift from the heart. She designed a stepped garden dwelling, breaking away from the current monotonous layout of most multi-story buildings, which are flat, uniform, and arranged in rows. The stepped garden dwelling provides each household with a 10-square-meter rooftop garden (the first floor has a ground-level garden), creating a good living environment in high-density conditions. The building's exterior is beautiful and simple, with concave and convex changes and bright colors, along with outdoor greenery, giving the dwelling an artistic atmosphere full of human touch. The design uses a 3600×3600 mm grid to form a basic unit of about 10 square meters, which can be combined into multiple spaces, allowing each household to have an additional useful living space compared to a typical dwelling. This adapts to different population structures and various short-term and long-term needs and changes. It also creates conditions for standardized, serialized, and diversified production, suitable for computer-aided design. The architect not only considered the current commercialization requirements of dwellings but also considered the high emotional needs of people in future society.

When visiting this dwelling building, I was deeply moved by the freshness and fragrance of the rooftop garden. It was like the music of the spring god, not in the distance but right before my eyes. A resident, a professor of aesthetics, said that under the night sky, the garden dwelling, with each window emitting a soft light, looks like a ship anchored here from afar.

The garden dwelling demonstrates that dwelling design is also an artistic creation and should not be relegated to the corner of being forgotten by art. The garden dwelling has been recognized by the academic community and was awarded "Excellent Architectural Art Work of the 1980s in China," and it is the only dwelling building among the ten excellent works.

When discussing her creative experience, Lü Junhua said, "People, in addition to material needs, ultimately have spiritual needs. Housing is not just a place to live; for everyone, it should be a unique 'home.'" This reminded me of the German poet-philosopher Hölderlin, whom Heidegger highly praised, with the lines: "Man dwells poetically on this earth."

To make real life artistic, to reveal the value and meaning of man, thank the architect for providing a poetic space to transcend the busy world.

    生活就是艺术
    王明贤
    艺术走向生活，生活成为艺术，这是现代环境艺术新观念。艺术不应是象牙之塔的玩物，而应由大众参与，深入到生活一切场所中。与人的生活关系最密切的是住宅，一个人的一生有近三分之二的光阴是在其中度过的。住宅如能体现艺术追求，那该是多么迷人的梦呵。
    就在人们抱怨住宅毫无特色以至小孩上学回家都找不到家门口时，清华大学建筑系教授吕俊华却为大众献上了一份礼物，献上了一颗心。她设计了台阶式花园住宅，打破了目前一般多层住宅一抹平、一刀切、排排坐、行列式等千篇一律的单调局面。台阶式花园住宅为每户提供了一个10平方米的屋顶花园（一层为地面花园），创造了高密度条件下的良好居住环境。建筑外观美丽简洁，凹凸变化，色块鲜明，再加上室外绿化，使住宅环境流露出充满人情味的艺术气息。住宅设计采用3600×3600毫米网格形成约10平方米的基本间，可作多空间组合，使每户能比一般的住宅多一个比小过厅有用的居住空间，便于适应不同人口结构、昼与夜、近远期多种需要和变化。它又为标准化、系列化、多样化生产创造了条件，适于计算机辅助设计。建筑师不仅考虑到当前住宅商品化要求，还考虑到今后社会中人的高情感的要求。
    参观这幢住宅楼时，我为屋顶花园的鲜妍和芬芳深深打动了，那简直是春之神的乐曲，但不在天边，却在眼前。而一位居住在此的美学教师说，夜幕下的花园住宅，家家窗户透出温柔的灯光，远看犹如一艘航船在此停泊。
    花园住宅向人们表明，住宅设计也是艺术创造，不应屈居于被艺术遗忘的角落里。花园住宅得到学术界的承认，被评为“中国八十年代建筑艺术优秀作品”，而且是十项优秀作品中唯一的住宅建筑。
    吕俊华谈创作体会时说：“人们除了物质需要之外，毕竟还有精神需求，住房决非仅为栖身之地，对每一个人来说，它应是独一无二的
  ‘家’。”这段话使我联想到海德格尔很赞赏的德国诗哲荷尔德林的诗句：“人诗意地栖居在大地上”。
    使现实生活艺术化，显现人的价值、人的意义，感谢建筑师为超越忙忙碌碌的此岸提供了一个诗意的空间。（附图片）
