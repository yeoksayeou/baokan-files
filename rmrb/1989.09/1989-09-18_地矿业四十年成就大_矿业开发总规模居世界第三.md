Over the past forty years, every city, every mine, and every major construction project in our country has been the result of the hard work of geologists. A force of 1.1 million geologists has laid a solid foundation of material resources for our country's construction.

In the past four decades, Chinese geologists have completed 290 million meters of drilling work, discovering 162 types of minerals and confirming reserves for 148 types. They have identified over 200,000 mineral deposits, with nearly 150,000 having confirmed reserves. The potential value of the resources identified ranks third in the world. Mineral exploration has promoted the rapid development of the mining industry. Over the past forty years, 7,800 state-owned mines and over 120,000 township and village mines have been established. China's overall mining development scale now ranks third in the world.

The scope of China's geological work has also expanded, covering not only traditional areas such as mineral exploration and basic geology, but also new fields such as environmental geology, agricultural geology, urban geology, and tourism geology, achieving significant economic benefits.

　　地矿业四十年成就大
　  矿业开发总规模居世界第三
    本报讯　四十年来，我国每一个城市、每一座矿山、每一项重大工程，无不洒下了地质工作者的辛勤汗水。一百一十万地质大军为祖国建设奠定了雄厚的物质资源基础。
    我国地质工作者四十年投入了二点九亿米的钻探工作量，发现矿产一百六十二种，探明有储量的一百四十八种。发现矿床（点）二十多万处，其中探明有一定储量的近一点五万处。已查明的资源潜在价值在世界上居第三位。矿产勘查促进了矿业的飞跃发展，四十年已建成国营矿山七千八百多座，乡镇小矿十二万多处。我国矿业开发总规模也已居世界第三位。
    我国地质工作的服务领域也在不断扩大，除传统的矿产勘查、基础地质等领域，还开拓了环境地质、农业地质、城市地质、旅游地质等新领域，取得了较大的经济效益。（曾绵华）
