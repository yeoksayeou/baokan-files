The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released its annual report on September 6, stating that the global economy grew by an estimated 4.2% last year, with world trade increasing by over 9%.

However, the report noted that many developing countries did not benefit from the rapid growth in the global economy and trade, and they are now facing the prospect of economic stagnation in the 1990s.

Last year, the average economic growth rate in Latin America was only 0.8%. Among the 26 countries surveyed in the region, 20 experienced a decline in per capita income. The report predicts that the economic growth rate in the region will further slow down this year, while inflation will continue to rise. The economic growth rate in Africa last year was only 2.6%.

According to a report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on September 6, due to unfavorable international conditions and other factors, the economic and social conditions of the least developed countries did not show significant improvement during the 1980s.

The report pointed out that the decline in primary commodity prices, the rise of trade protectionism, insufficient funding, and the potential halt of commercial bank loans have led to a worsening situation for the least developed countries.

    联合国贸发会议发表报告指出
    去年世界经济增长百分之四点二
    最不发达国家境况没有明显改善
    据新华社日内瓦9月6日电　联合国贸发会议6日发表的年度报告说，去年世界经济估计增长了4.2％，世界贸易增长了9％以上。
    但是报告说，许多第三世界国家并没有从世界经济和贸易的迅速增长中获益，而且还面临着90年代经济发展停滞的局面。
    去年拉美国家的平均经济增长率仅为0.8％；在该地区进行调查的26个国家中，有20个国家的人均收入下降了。报告预计，今年该地区的经济增长速度将进一步放慢，而通货膨胀仍将上升；去年非洲地区的经济也仅增长了2.6％。
    据新华社日内瓦9月6日电　联合国贸易和发展会议6日发表的一份报告表明，由于国际环境不利等因素的影响，最不发达国家的经济和社会状况在80年代期间并未得到明显改善。
    报告指出，初级产品价格下跌、贸易保护主义抬头、资金供给不足及商业银行贷款可能停止，使最不发达国家的境遇趋于恶化。
