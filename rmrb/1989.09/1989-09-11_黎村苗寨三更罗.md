The jeep slowly climbed up the winding mountain road to the high Wind Gate Ridge, and soon arrived at San Geng Luo Township, surrounded by mountains, in Wanning County. Several tea houses and grocery stores lined the street, with a variety of fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, and eggs. The girls were dressed in bright, fashionable skirts, and the young men wore trendy "space suits" and jeans from the city... The mountain gate of San Geng Luo, which had been blocked by the high Wind Gate Ridge for so long, is now open.

Walking through the lush banana grove, a wooden house with a tiled roof came into view, and the betel nut trees in front of the house were already bearing young fruits.

The Li ethnic minority strongman Yao Shixiong, who had just finished his work, still vividly remembers that when he was a child, his family lived in a desolate mountain. His ancestors slashed and burned the land, ate wild vegetables, drank mountain stream water, covered themselves with tree bark, and lived in thatched huts. In 1950, the Party and the people's government mobilized the Li and Miao ethnic minorities to move down the mountain to live, providing money, grain, and medical services at the doorstep, teaching advanced farming methods, building mountain reservoirs and small hydroelectric power stations, and establishing schools and hospitals...

After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, Yao Shixiong started a business on the mountain, planting more than 100 mu of bananas, pineapples, rubber, and betel nuts, and became a millionaire a few years ago.

The township party committee secretary Zhu Xiaoping said that now in San Geng Luo, every household has a small farm, and every family has a courtyard economy. Last year, the per capita income was 400 yuan, nearly four times higher than before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

In the evening, we entered Jia Chao Village, hidden among the coconut trees. At the head of the village, in the new house of the Li family, there were six short sofas and one long sofa lined up against the wall in the hall, and a television set placed on the table. I looked everywhere, but the ship-shaped thatched huts, stone mortars, stone stoves, and tree branch beds that were once ubiquitous were nowhere to be found.

The female head of this ordinary Li family is named Chen Gaorong. Her husband teaches in another place, and her two sons are in middle school. We asked, "Is the grain enough to eat?" "Yes. Every meal has dry rice to eat, and there is no shortage of vegetables, fish, and meat..." Chen Gaorong turned around and offered us betel nuts to chew. Chewing the fruit that gradually changes from bitter to sweet, a surge of warmth welled up in our hearts.

　　黎村苗寨三更罗
    吉普车沿着蜿蜒的盘山公路缓缓地爬上了高高的风门岭，一会儿便到了群山环抱的万宁县三更罗乡。十几家茶馆、杂货铺依街排列，瓜果菜鱼肉蛋品种繁多。姑娘们身着鲜艳的时髦衣裙，小伙子穿的是城里流行的“太空服”、牛仔裤……被高高的风门岭阻隔的三更罗，如今打开了封闭已久的山门。
    穿过茂盛的芭蕉林，一间木墙瓦顶房映入眼帘，房前的一排槟榔树已挂上青青的幼果。
    刚放下活儿的黎族壮汉姚世雄还清楚地记得，小时候一家住在荒凉的大山上。祖辈们刀耕火种，吃野菜，喝山沟水，盖树皮，住茅房。一九五○年，党和人民政府动员黎、苗族下山居住，送钱送粮送医上门，教给先进的耕作方法，修山塘水库，办小水电站，建起学校和医院……
    农村实行承包责任制后，姚世雄上山创业，种植了香蕉、菠萝、橡胶、槟榔等一百多亩，早几年就成了万元户。
    乡党委书记朱小平说，现在的三更罗，户户有小农场，家家有庭院经济。去年人均收入四百元，比十一届三中全会前增长近四倍。
    傍晚，我们进入了椰树掩映的加朝村。村头的黎家，新住宅里，厅堂墙边排着六张短沙发和一张长沙发，一台电视机端放桌上。我到处寻觅，往日举目皆是的船型茅屋、石臼、石头灶、树杈床……全无踪影。
    这个普通黎族家庭女主人叫陈高荣，丈夫在外地当教师，两个儿子读中学。我们问：“粮食够不够吃？”“够。顿顿都有干饭吃，菜、鱼、肉也不断顿……”陈高荣转身捧出槟榔给我们嚼。嚼着由苦涩渐变甘甜的果实，一股热潮涌上我们的心头。　（邢福金撰文　武进群摄影）（附图片）
