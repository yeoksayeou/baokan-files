In front of Hongkou Park in Shanghai, there is a sign for the revolutionary martyr's memorial site "Li Bai Martyr's Former Residence," personally inscribed by Comrade Chen Yun. However, the background of this sign is an advertisement for the "Business Scope" of the Shanghai Shenyi Plastic Products Factory. I always feel that this sign, placed here, is somewhat disrespectful. The creators may have done so unintentionally, but the impact it creates will make visitors wonder.

Although the sign for the revolutionary martyr's memorial site is indicative, it should be solemn and dignified. The choice of location for the inscription and the placement of the sign also reflect one's sentiments.

    不协调的背景
    在上海虹口公园对面，见一陈云同志亲笔题写的“李白烈士故居”的革命烈士纪念地告示牌，背景却是上海申艺塑料制品厂的“经营项目广告”。我总觉得这一告示牌镶嵌在这里有些不敬。制作者也许是无心，可影响所及，参观者又会怎么说呢？
    革命烈士纪念地告示牌，虽属指示性的，但应严肃、庄重。择地而书，择地而立，也见感情。
