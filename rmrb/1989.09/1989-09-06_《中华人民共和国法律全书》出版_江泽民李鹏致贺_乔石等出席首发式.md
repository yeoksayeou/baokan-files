Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 6th.

A monumental work documenting the legal construction of New China—"The Legal Book of the People's Republic of China"—was launched today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Politburo Standing Committee member of the Communist Party of China, Qiao Shi, attended the launch ceremony and conveyed the congratulations of General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Premier Li Peng sent a letter of congratulations for the publication, stating, "The publication of this book will play a certain role in promoting the development of democracy and the rule of law in our country." Xu Zhongxun, Peng Chong, Chen Muhua, Wang Hanbin, Ren Jianxin, and over 200 legal scholars from the capital attended the ceremony.

In recent years, China has done a lot of work in the compilation of laws and regulations. As the idea of ruling the country by law becomes more deeply rooted in people's minds, various sectors of society are eagerly hoping for a comprehensive, systematic, and accurate legal book. With the support of the Legal Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, and the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, Jilin People's Publishing House invited legal experts and scholars to gather forces from all sides. After a year of intense work, they completed this monumental project in China's legal construction.

Experts believe that this book is the first legal encyclopedia of New China. The book is divided into ten parts: Constitution, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law, Marriage Law, Economic Law, Administrative Law, Administrative Procedure Law, and International Law. It includes over 1,200 current laws, regulations, and legal normative interpretations from the founding of New China to April 4th of this year. Unlike previous compilations of laws and regulations, this book also categorizes and compiles the legislative, judicial, and administrative interpretations of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, and the State Council. The entire book is approximately five million words.

    江泽民李鹏致贺　乔石等出席首发式
    本报北京九月六日讯　记者吴恒权、张志业报道：一部记录新中国法制建设的巨著——《中华人民共和国法律全书》，今天在北京人民大会堂举行首发式。
    中共中央政治局常委乔石出席了首发式并转达了江泽民总书记对该部法律全书出版的祝贺。国务院总理李鹏为此书出版致信祝贺，说“该书的出版对于推动我国的民主与法制建设，将起到一定的作用”。习仲勋、彭冲、陈慕华、王汉斌、任建新等和首都法学界人士二百多人出席了今天的首发式。
    记者获悉，近年来，我国在法规整理方面做了许多工作。但随着依法治国思想日益深入人心，社会各界急切期望有一部全面系统、准确适用的法律全书。为此，在全国人大法律委员会、最高人民法院、国务院法制局的支持下，吉林人民出版社邀请法律界专家、学者，云集各方面力量，经过一年时间紧张工作，完成了中国法制建设中的这件浩大工程。
    专家认为，该书堪称新中国第一部法律大典。全书分为宪法、刑法、刑诉法、民法、民诉法、婚姻法、经济法、行政法、行政诉讼法、国际法十大部分，囊括了新中国成立以来至今年四月四日的现行法律、法规以及法律规范性解释一千二百余件。与以往出版的法律、法规汇编不同，该书特将全国人大常委会、最高人民法院和国务院有关立法、司法和行政解释也分门别类编集在内，全书共约五百万字。
