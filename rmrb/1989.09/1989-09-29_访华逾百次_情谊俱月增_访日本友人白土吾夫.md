At first glance, his thick eyebrows and deep, stern gaze give an impression of seriousness, but upon conversation, he comes across as open and approachable. On the eve of National Day, our reporter interviewed Mr. Shirakawa Go, a director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association.

Mr. Shirakawa said, "The birth of the People's Republic of China marked a new era in world history." He believes that the greatest positive impact of New China lies in delaying and reducing the possibility of a third world war, which is China's greatest contribution to the cause of peace and the world's people.

"Of course, development is not without difficulties and twists," Mr. Shirakawa continued, recalling some past events. It was 1960 when Chairman Mao Zedong met with a delegation of Japanese writers in Shanghai. During the conversation, Chairman Mao asked, "Who among you is the least influential, the least famous, the least wealthy, and the youngest?" Mr. Shirakawa raised his hand. Chairman Mao then spoke about his own youth, when he had nothing, and encouraged everyone present to make the most of their youth. Chairman Mao emphasized that the success of the Chinese revolution had both experiences and lessons. One cannot only talk about experiences and forget to summarize lessons. Mr. Shirakawa said, "It is very natural for China to encounter some difficulties in its progress. China's reform and opening up, exploring a new path suitable to its national conditions, has attracted the attention of countries around the world and has already achieved significant results. I am convinced that, based on the summary of experiences and lessons, the cause of reform and opening up will achieve even greater development."

Over the past 30 years, to promote cultural exchanges between China and Japan, Mr. Shirakawa has visited China 122 times. When asked which moment in his experience of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges was the most unforgettable, Mr. Shirakawa said that he had met Chairman Mao Zedong six times and Premier Zhou Enlai over 40 times, and each meeting and conversation left a lasting impression. However, what he remembered most was the "ballet diplomacy."

In July 1972, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association invited the Shanghai Ballet Troupe of China, led by Sun Pinghua, to visit Japan. The delegation of 208 people was unprecedented in scale. During the 37-day visit and performances, Sun Pinghua, the leader of the delegation, had extensive contact with the Japanese political circles, doing a great deal of work for Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei's visit to China a month later and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. During the delegation's visit to Japan, Japanese government officials attended the welcoming activities for the Chinese delegation for the first time. Even more exciting was that when the delegation returned home, they took two flights directly to Shanghai, the first direct flight between the two countries since the war, when diplomatic relations had not yet been established. To ensure the safety of their Chinese friends' return, Japanese friends Mr. and Mrs. Kenzō Nakajima, Miyakawa Toru, Shirakawa Bun, and the presidents of Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways bravely boarded the plane to Shanghai. Led by Shirakawa Go, then director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Japanese friends made meticulous arrangements to ensure the smooth first flight to China. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tanaka visited China, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan were restored. The "ballet diplomacy" is not as well-known as the "ping-pong diplomacy," but it left an important page in the history of Sino-Japanese relations.

Mr. Shirakawa told the reporter that he visits China several times a year, either to receive visiting Chinese friends or to promote cultural exchanges. The achievements of cultural exchanges are different from those of economic exchanges and cannot be measured by investment or transaction amounts. Cultural exchanges are about people-to-people and heart-to-heart exchanges between two countries, based on mutual trust, understanding, respect, and friendship. With a solid foundation, the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China can be realized for generations to come.

Mr. Shirakawa is 62 years old this year. During his university days, he studied electrical engineering and law and was one of the leaders of the left-wing student movement in the 1950s. In 1956, at the invitation of Mr. Kenzō Nakajima, he joined the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association. He said, "At that time, I knew nothing about China. Engaging in Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges has been very beneficial to me. To this day, I still feel that my initial choice was correct. Someone asked me, if I had a second life, what profession would I choose? I would still choose Sino-Japanese cultural exchange."

    访华逾百次　情谊俱月增
    ——访日本友人白土吾夫
    本报记者　于　青
    看外表，他的两道浓眉下，目光深邃，神情冷峻，但一交谈，却给人一种知无不言、平易近人的印象。在国庆节前夕，记者采访了日中文化交流协会专务理事白土吾夫先生。
    白土先生说：“中华人民共和国的诞生，是世界历史上的一个新纪元。”他认为，新中国最大的积极作用在于推迟和减少了第三次世界大战爆发的可能性，这是中国对和平事业和世界人民的最大贡献。
      “当然，发展中不可能没有困难和曲折。”白土先生接着回忆了一些往事。那是1960年，毛泽东主席在上海接见日本作家代表团。谈话中，毛主席提出一个问题：“你们当中谁是最没有地位、没有名望、没有财产、年龄最小的？”白土先生举起了手。于是毛主席谈到自己年青时代也是一无所有，并勉励在座者趁年青时多做工作。毛主席在谈到中国革命历史时，强调指出，中国革命取得成功，有经验，也有教训。不能只谈经验，忘记总结教训。白土先生说：“中国在前进中遇到一些困难是很自然的事情。中国在改革开放中探索适合本国国情的新道路，引起世界各国的关注，并已取得了不小的成就。我确信，中国在总结经验教训的基础上，改革开放事业必将取得更大的发展。”
    30多年来，为促进中日文化交流，白土先生至今共访华122次。记者问他在中日文化交流的经历中，最难忘的是哪一幕。白土先生说，他曾6次见到过毛泽东主席，40多次见到过周恩来总理，每一次会见和交谈都使他终生难忘。但他印象最深的则是那次“舞剧外交”。
    1972年7月，日中文化交流协会邀请以孙平化为团长的中国上海舞剧团访问日本，代表团一行208人，规模是前所未有的。访问演出37天中，孙平化团长与日本政界进行了广泛的接触，为一个月后日本首相田中角荣访华和中日建立邦交，做了大量工作。代表团访日期间，日本政府官员第一次出席参加了欢迎中国代表团的活动。更令人振奋的是，代表团回国时，要乘两架飞机直飞上海，这是战后中日两国尚未建立外交关系时的首次直飞航班。为使中国朋友安心回国，日本友好人士中岛健藏夫妇、宫川寅雄、白石凡、白土吾夫，以及日航公司和全日空公司的社长毅然同机前往上海。以当时任日中文化交流协会事务局长白土吾夫为首的日本友好人士，为使飞机顺利首航中国作了精心安排。随后，田中首相访华，中日恢复邦交。“舞剧外交”并不像“乒乓外交”那样尽人皆知，但在中日关系史上留下了重要的一页。
    白土先生告诉记者，他每年都要数次访问中国，或接待来访的中国友人。文化交流的成果不同于经济交流的成果，是不能用投资额、成交额来计算的。文化交流是两国之间人与人、心与心的交流，是建立在相互信赖、理解、尊重和友好的基础上的。有了牢固的基础，才能实现日中两国人民世代友好。
    白土先生今年62岁，大学时代学过电气和法律，是50年代左翼学生运动领袖之一。1956年，应中岛健藏先生之邀，进入日中文化交流协会工作。他说：“当年我对中国一无所知，从事日中文化交流使我受益匪浅。至今我觉得当初自己的选择是正确的。有人问我，如果有第二次生命，选择什么职业。我回答，还干日中文化交流。”
