In Liaoning, 17-year-old middle school student Zhang Li was diagnosed with leukemia. Her parents, who are ordinary workers, were unable to afford the enormous medical expenses. News of her condition spread, and tens of thousands of people from cities and countryside across Liaoning extended helping hands, sending money by mail or in person. Within a few days, 140,000 yuan was collected, allowing Zhang Li to receive timely treatment.

In Yingkou, the ice on the Liaohai River broke, leaving 59 people stranded on floating ice blocks. In an instant, workers, residents, and even children from the shore rushed to the scene, rowing boats towards the river's center. Thirty minutes later, all the people on the ice were rescued.

In Shenyang, a "Learn from Lei Feng" group was formed among the freshmen of the Chinese Medicine Department at Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Over the next ten years, as old students graduated and new ones enrolled, the group's activities became increasingly vibrant. Professor Li Rui, who was weak and often ill and had no children, remarked, "These young people have walked the path of Lei Feng for ten years!"

Liaoning is the great place where the outstanding communist warrior Lei Feng lived and fought. His spirit of helping others and serving the people wholeheartedly is deeply engraved in the hearts of the people of the entire province, inspiring countless "Lei Fengs" to grow and thrive.

With the development of the commodity economy, people's thoughts and values are also changing. However, the various levels of the Party and Youth League organizations in Liaoning have consistently carried out activities to learn from Lei Feng. The Lei Feng Class in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been passed down from generation to generation. Schools named after Lei Feng have cultivated talents all over the country, and various "Learn from Lei Feng" groups caring for military veterans and the "five guarantees" households are scattered throughout cities and countryside. Just in Fushun City, over 30,000 such groups have been established. In recent years, many youth poverty alleviation and wealth-creation groups have emerged in the vast rural areas of Liaoning, giving new content to the activities of learning from Lei Feng.

    他们个个像雷锋
    辽阳。十七岁的中学生张莉患了白血病。身为普通工人的双亲无力负担巨额医药费。消息传开，辽宁城乡成千上万双援助之手伸了过来，一张张人民币邮来、送来。几天间，就汇集一点四万元，张莉及时得到了治疗。
    营口。辽河口冰面断裂，顺流而下的冰块上滞留五十九个人。霎时间，岸边的工人、街道居民甚至儿童纷纷赶来，划船直奔河心。三十分钟后，冰块上的人全部得救。
    沈阳。辽宁中医学院中药系刚入学的新生中，一个“学雷锋小组”诞生了。此后十年中，老生走，新生来，小组活动越来越活跃。体弱多病而又无儿无女的李锐教授说：“这些青年走的是十年雷锋路呵！”……
    辽宁是伟大的共产主义战士雷锋生活和战斗过的地方。他助人为乐、全心全意为人民服务的精神深深地铭刻在全省人民的心中，激励着千千万万个“雷锋”茁壮成长。
    随着商品经济的发展，人们的思想意识、价值观念也在发生变化。但辽宁各级党、团组织始终坚持开展学习雷锋活动。解放军某部雷锋班一代代相传，以雷锋命名的中学和小学培养的桃李遍天下，青少年照顾军烈属和“五保户”等各种各样学雷锋小组遍布城乡，仅抚顺市就建起三万多个。近年来，在辽宁的广大农村又涌现出许多青年扶贫帮富小组，赋予了学雷锋活动新的内容。
