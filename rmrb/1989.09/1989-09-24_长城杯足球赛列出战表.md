    长城杯足球赛列出战表
    本报北京九月二十三日讯  记者汪大昭从中国足球协会获悉：有两主两客共四支球队参加的一九八九年中国长城杯国际足球赛，将于九月二十九日晚在北京揭开战幕。比赛采用单循环方式。
    首轮两场交锋地点均在先农坛体育场进行，中国国家队对中国奥林匹克队，朝鲜平壤队对苏联敖德萨黑海人俱乐部队。国庆之夜进行的第二轮比赛，中苏之战将成为北京工人体育场整修一新后的首场国际足球比赛，而中国奥林匹克队与朝鲜平壤队移师天津作赛。十月三日晚六点开始，四支球队再次聚会于北京先农坛体育场，作最后一轮角逐，由中国奥林匹克队迎战苏联黑海人队，中国国家队对朝鲜平壤队。
    据了解，正在科威特访问比赛的中国国家队和在济南参加全国甲级队联赛的中国奥林匹克队，都将于近日回京。朝鲜队也定于二十五日抵京。在苏联足坛数二数三的甲级劲旅黑海人队似乎胸有成竹，预计在二十九日揭幕战前才会到京。
