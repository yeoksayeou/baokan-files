Construction has begun on the western railway line connecting the Soviet Union's Kazakhstan and China's Xinjiang.

According to TASS, today construction workers started building a mechanized shunting yard at the Soviet border station "Friendship." Goods transported from China will be distributed from here to various destinations.

This railway line, from the Soviet "Friendship" station to China's Alashankou, is scheduled to be operational by 1992. Goods transported from London to Shanghai via this railway line will be twice as fast as sea transport.

    据塔斯社报道，今天在苏联边境站“友谊”车站铁路建设者开始了机械化调车场的修建工作，由中国运来的货物将从这里分送各地。
    这条从苏联“友谊”车站到中国阿拉山口的铁路线计划在1992年前通车。通过这条铁路线从伦敦运往上海的货物要比海运快一倍。
