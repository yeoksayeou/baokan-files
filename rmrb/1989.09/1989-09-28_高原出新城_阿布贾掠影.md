In the central highlands of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a brand-new city has risen from the ground. This is Nigeria's new capital, Abuja.

Nigeria was originally an agricultural country. Since the 1970s, the oil industry has risen, and the national economy has flourished. The influx of "petrodollars" led the then-leaders to consider moving the capital. In 1976, the federal government formally issued a decree to move the capital to Abuja. Three years later, construction of the new capital began. The Nigerian government made this decision for political and economic reasons. First, the original capital, Lagos, was already overcrowded, with numerous social problems piling up, putting increasing pressure on the government. Second, moving the capital to the central region could break the isolation of the interior, stimulate the local economy, and promote balanced and coordinated economic development across the country. Third, Nigeria is a multi-ethnic country with over 250 large and small ethnic groups. Some ethnic groups have long been at odds, even to the point of conflict. Moving the central government northward would also help in uniting and consolidating the country.

The new capital, Abuja, gives a strong impression of being new and spacious. Everything here is new: the newly built international airport, the newly paved dual carriageways, the newly constructed residential buildings, and even the hotel bedding is clean and white.

Abuja is built in an uneven highland basin, surrounded by lush green mountains, making the natural scenery very beautiful. The total planned area of the new capital is 250 square kilometers, and when fully completed, it can accommodate 3.1 million people. The first areas to be constructed are the residential districts of Garki, Wuse, Maitama, and Asokoro, along with a central district. Each district is self-contained, with highways connecting them. In the Garki and Wuse residential districts, the reporter saw rows of four-story low-rent housing already built, and many supporting facilities have also been put into use. Some places are quite bustling. The central district is the heart of the city, divided into four areas: one area is the location of the National Assembly, the Presidential Palace, and the High Court; another is where various government departments and national institutions are located; another is the cultural district, with the National Library and National Museum, as well as religious institutions; and the fourth is the commercial district, with supermarkets, shops, banks, and other facilities. Some buildings in the central district have been completed, while others are still under construction. Two industrial zones are also planned: one in Idu for light industry and another in Gwagwalada for heavy industry.

Future Abuja will also be a tourist city. The climate is cool, the air is fresh, and there is no pollution or the hustle and bustle of a big city. Tall coconut trees and towering oil palm trees allow one to fully immerse oneself in the warmth of nature. Since the city is still in its early stages of development, many tourist spots have not yet been developed, but even the existing Kurara Falls and Juma Rock are enough to attract visitors. Abuja has already built several 4-star and 5-star hotels, and in the future, Abuja will also be an ideal venue for international conferences.

However, in recent years, due to the sharp drop in oil prices, Nigeria's national income has significantly decreased, and the country is facing serious economic difficulties. The construction of Abuja has also slowed down. Nevertheless, the Nigerian people have turned the dream of relocating the capital into reality through their hard work, which is truly remarkable.

    高原出新城
    ——阿布贾掠影
    本报记者  杨汝生
    在尼日利亚联邦共和国的中部高原上，一座崭新的城市拔地而起，这就是尼日利亚的新首都——阿布贾。
    尼日利亚原是农业国，自70年代后，石油工业崛起，国家经济蓬勃发展，源源而来的“石油美元”促使当时的领导人萌生迁都之意。1976年联邦政府正式颁布将首都迁往阿布贾的法令，3年后新都破土动工。尼政府做出这一决定有政治和经济的原因。一是原首都拉各斯早已人满为患，社会问题成堆，对政府的压力愈来愈大，十分令人头疼；二是将首都迁往中部地区，可以打破内地的封闭状态，活跃内地经济，有利于实现全国各地经济均衡协调地发展；三是尼日利亚是个多部族的国家，全国共有大小部族250余个，一些部族长期不和，甚至发生过冲突，将中央政权北迁，也有利于全国的团结和统一。
    新首都阿布贾给人的突出印象是新和旷。这里的一切都是新的，新修的国际机场，新铺的双向道路，新盖的居民楼，甚至连旅馆的卧具也都洁白干净。
    阿布贾建在一个凹凸不平的高原盆地上，周围有翠绿的山峦环绕，自然风光十分美丽。新都设计总面积为250平方公里，待全部建成后可容纳310万人生活居住。首先动工兴建的是加基、沃西、梅塔纳和阿索科罗四个居民区和一个中央区。每个区都自成一体，区与区之间有高速公路相连。在加基和沃西两个居民区，记者看到已经修建了一片片四层楼低租金住房，许多相配套的辅助设施也已投入使用，有的地方相当繁华。中央区是全市的中心，它又分为四个区：一个区是国民议会、总统府和高级法院所在地；一个是政府各部和全国性机构办公的地方；一个是文化区，建有国立图书馆和国家博物院，以及宗教机构等；还有一个商业区，有超级市场、商店、银行等。中心区有的建筑物已经竣工，有的正在兴建。它还拟建两个工业区，一个在伊杜，为轻工业区；另一个在格瓦格瓦拉达，为重工业区。
    未来的阿布贾还将是一个旅游城市。这里气候凉爽，空气清新，没有任何污染，也没有大城市的拥挤、喧闹和纷扰。高大的椰子树，挺拔的油棕林，可使人尽情地陶醉在大自然的温馨之中。因城市还处初建阶段，许多旅游点尚未开发，但仅有的古拉拉瀑布和朱马大岩石就足以引人入胜了。阿布贾已修建了好几个4星级和5星级的旅馆，届时，阿布贾也是举行国际会议的理想场所。
    可是，近几年来，由于石油价格剧跌，尼日利亚的国民收入大大减少，国家遇到严重的经济困难，阿布贾的城建工作也放慢了速度。但不管怎样，尼日利亚人民毕竟用自己辛勤的劳动，把迁都的理想变成了现实，这是非常了不起的。
