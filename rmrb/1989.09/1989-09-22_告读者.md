With the strong support of the party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and sister newspapers, 33 issues of the "National Day Special Edition" have been completed today. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who have supported and cared for the publication of the "National Day Special Edition"!

In order to record the glorious achievements of the 40 years of New China and the local scenery, the special edition and related materials will be compiled into a book by the editorial office of this newspaper. We hope that everyone will continue to assist us.
