Comrade Lin Tie, an excellent Communist Party member, a loyal Communist warrior tested by time, and a revolutionary and party affairs activist of the proletariat, was born in a rural intellectual family in Wanxian, Sichuan Province. In his youth, under the direct influence of early party leaders such as Xiao Chufu and Yun Dairen, he accepted revolutionary ideas and actively participated in the anti-imperialist patriotic student movement, immersing himself in the revolutionary struggle. He joined the Communist Party of China in November 1926.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Lin Tie served as the first secretary of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee, concurrently as the first political commissar of the military region, governor, chairman of the provincial political consultative conference, chairman of the North China Cooperation Committee, member of the North China Bureau, third secretary of the North China Bureau, and member of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, among other positions.

During the ten years of turmoil, Comrade Lin Tie was brutally persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing anti-party clique. After the Gang of Four was overthrown, Comrade Lin Tie actively supported the Party Central Committee in rectifying the wrongs and enthusiastically supported the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. He took the initiative to step down to the second line to achieve the cooperation and replacement of old and new cadres. In opposing the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, he took a clear stand and firmly supported the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Comrade Lin Tie served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress and an advisor to the Central Organization Department. He was elected as a member of the Central Advisory Commission at the Twelfth National Congress of the Party. (For more details on Comrade Lin Tie's life, see tomorrow's newspaper.)

More than 500 people, including relevant responsible persons and friends of Comrade Lin Tie, attended the funeral.
