A group of foreign senior experts who have worked in China for decades received honor certificates from the State Council.

The honor certificates, signed by Premier Li Peng, read: "For decades, you have stood with the Chinese people through thick and thin, sharing their hardships. You have made significant contributions to the liberation cause and socialist construction of the Chinese people, and to promoting mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world. To commend and express our gratitude for your valuable contributions, this certificate of honor is hereby awarded."

Most of the experts who received the certificates came to the liberated areas in the 1930s and 1940s with sincere sympathy and support for the Chinese revolution, enduring hardships to participate in revolutionary work. Others were sent by foreign brother parties in the early years after the founding of the People's Republic. Currently, their average age is 72, with the oldest being 93. Except for three who have retired, the rest are still working in news, broadcasting, publishing, and higher education institutions in China.

These experts come from the United States, Britain, France, Canada, West Germany, Austria, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, who presented the certificates, said, "For decades, you have dedicated your most precious years to the revolutionary and construction causes of the Chinese people. You are indeed sincere friends and comrades of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never forget your merits and friendship."

He said that in the recent turmoil from the student movement to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the senior experts firmly believed in the leadership of the Communist Party of China, fully understood the decisive measures taken by the Chinese government, and some even persisted in going to work in extremely difficult circumstances, striving to do a good job in external propaganda and helping people from various countries to correctly understand the facts.

State Councilor and Minister of Education Li Tieying and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan attended the certificate awarding ceremony.

    李鹏总理签署证书　吴学谦出席颁发式
    新华社北京9月23日电  国务院副总理吴学谦今天向29位在华工作的外国老专家颁发了国务院授予的荣誉证书。
    由李鹏总理签署的荣誉证书上写着：“您几十年来与中国人民风雨同舟，患难与共，为中国人民的解放事业和社会主义建设事业，为促进中国人民同世界各国人民的相互了解和友谊，做了大量工作。为了表彰和感谢您的宝贵贡献，特发此荣誉证书。”
    被授予荣誉证书的老专家大多是三四十年代怀着真诚同情和支持中国革命的感情，历尽艰辛奔赴解放区参加革命工作的；还有的是建国初期外国兄弟党派来的。目前，他们平均年龄72岁，最大的已93岁。除已退休的三人外，其他人仍分别在中国的新闻、广播、出版和高等院校工作。
    这些专家来自美国、英国、法国、加拿大、联邦德国、奥地利、日本、泰国和马来西亚等九个国家。
    吴学谦副总理在颁发荣誉证书仪式上说，“几十年来，你们把最宝贵的年华贡献给了中国人民的革命和建设事业，你们不愧是中国人民真诚的朋友和同志，中国人民永远不会忘记你们的功绩和友谊。”
    他说，在不久前发生的从学潮到动乱到反革命暴乱的风波中，老专家们能坚信中国共产党的领导，充分理解中国政府所采取的果断措施，有的在非常困难情况下坚持上班，努力做好对外宣传工作，帮助各国人民正确了解事实真相。
    国务委员、国家教委主任李铁映和国务院秘书长罗干出席了荣誉证书授予仪式。
