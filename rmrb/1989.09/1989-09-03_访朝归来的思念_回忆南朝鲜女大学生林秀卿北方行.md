Lim Su-kyung finally returned to the South via Panmunjom. As she crossed the temporary military demarcation line and turned to wave goodbye to her fellow countrymen in the North, her expression was stern, with a mix of sorrow and anger.

Lim Su-kyung, as a representative of the million university students in South Korea, secretly traveled through several countries to arrive in Pyongyang to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival at the end of June. Her journey also had a lofty goal—to promote the wish of 70 million compatriots for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The distance from Seoul to Pyongyang is only about 300 kilometers, a journey that can be completed in 4 hours by car. However, she was forced to travel through Europe, taking a full 10 days. The division of the country and the separation of the nation made her deeply feel the misfortune and pain of the country and its people. Lim Su-kyung realized the heavy responsibility she bore and, upon arriving in the North, declared that she would definitely return to the South via Panmunjom to express her determination to dedicate herself to the cause of reunification.

On July 21, an international peace march supporting peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula, composed of over 400 representatives from more than 30 countries and regions, set off from Mount Baekdu, the northernmost point of the Korean Peninsula. The plan was to pass through Panmunjom and ultimately reach Mount Halla, the southernmost point of the Korean Peninsula. Lim Su-kyung was the most notable figure in this march. The People's Daily delegation happened to arrive in Pyongyang on the same day, beginning a 10-day visit to North Korea. Could the "Great March" be realized? Would Lim Su-kyung be able to cross the temporary military demarcation line at Panmunjom to return to the South? Would she become a second Mun Ik-hwan? These naturally became topics of constant discussion during our visit.

On the night of July 21, Cho Tae-yong, the director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun, visited our lodging at the Koryo Hotel to discuss the schedule. We proposed postponing the visit to Panmunjom by two days, changing it to July 27, so that we could witness the arrival of the "Great March" at Panmunjom and have the opportunity to interview Lim Su-kyung. However, since the entire schedule had already been arranged, it was difficult to make changes, and our request was not granted. The hosts expressed their apologies, and we felt very regretful.

On July 23, we took the train from Pyongyang to Kaesong. Along the way, Comrade Cho Tae-yong informed us that due to the obstruction by the South Korean authorities and the American side of the Military Armistice Commission, the "Great March" plan might not be fully realized. However, Lim Su-kyung's personal return to the South via Panmunjom was unavoidable. He said, "Lim Su-kyung has made up her mind, even if it means shedding blood, she is determined. Her actions represent the will of a nation." He could barely contain his excitement, and his voice was filled with confident strength. On the same day we left Pyongyang, Lim Su-kyung and the "Great March" team had arrived in Pyongyang, preparing to go to Kaesong via Sariwon and Haeju, and to reach Panmunjom on July 27, the 36th anniversary of the Korean Armistice. This event, which stirred the hearts of millions, was uncertain in its outcome, and our entire delegation became even more concerned.

On July 27, we ascended Mount Kumgang. It was the rainy season in Korea. Mount Kumgang was shrouded in a misty rain, making it exceptionally beautiful. Although we were in the mountains, our hearts were in Panmunjom. Had the "Great March" team arrived? Could Lim Su-kyung push open the gate? Even the most beautiful scenery could not dispel these questions from our minds. At night, we gathered early in front of the television, preparing to watch the live broadcast of Lim Su-kyung and the "Great March" team arriving at Panmunjom. Unfortunately, that night, the mountain was hit by strong winds and rain, causing the television broadcast to be interrupted midway. We only saw the "Great March" team arriving in Kaesong and holding a rally at the Panmunjom Pavilion, but we did not see the crucial part. According to the North Korean comrades' later introduction, at that time, the temporary military demarcation line on both sides was heavily guarded. American soldiers and North Korean People's Army soldiers stood facing each other. Lim Su-kyung and her party left the Panmunjom on the North side and walked towards the South side. Due to the prohibition by the South Korean authorities and the American military, Lim Su-kyung stood on the steps in front of the gate and could not proceed further. Lim Su-kyung was furious, tears welling up in her eyes as she looked up to the southern sky and cried out in a voice that touched the heart, "This is my homeland, our land, why can't I return to the South from here?!" This voice still echoes in my ears.

When we finished our visit to North Korea, Lim Su-kyung and her party had been on a hunger strike at the Panmunjom Pavilion for 5 days, gaining widespread sympathy and support both domestically and internationally. The day after we returned to Beijing, we saw in the newspapers that Lim Su-kyung declared on August 1 to stop the hunger strike and vowed to return to the South via Panmunjom on August 15, the 44th anniversary of Korea's liberation.

Lim Su-kyung knew that the path was filled with thorns and danger, but she chose to walk it anyway. Her spirit and courage are admirable. She succeeded and finally, on August 15, returned to the South via Panmunjom, embodying the wish of a million university students in the South to build a bridge of unity across the temporary military demarcation line.

The South Korean authorities had already threatened that Lim Su-kyung had violated the National Security Law and would be detained and investigated, and even face legal measures, including the death penalty. Although Lim Su-kyung had returned to the South, her fate was still worrying. Forty years ago, Mr. Kim Gu, in opposition to the U.S. imperialist policy of dividing Korea and in pursuit of national unity, participated in the South-North Joint Conference held in Pyongyang in April 1948. Upon returning to Seoul, he was brutally assassinated. Forty years later, the famous South Korean figure Reverend Mun Ik-hwan followed the path of Mr. Kim Gu and came to Pyongyang in March this year to continue his unfinished work. Upon returning to Seoul, Reverend Mun Ik-hwan was arrested in the airplane cabin for violating the National Security Law and is still imprisoned.

Now that Lim Su-kyung has returned to her hometown, the South Korean authorities immediately sent a helicopter to escort her to Seoul. Will Lim Su-kyung face the same misfortune as Mr. Kim Gu and Reverend Mun Ik-hwan? But she is innocent. Her journey to the North was noble and upright, a great patriotic deed. Read the letter Lim Su-kyung left for her parents before leaving Seoul! She wrote, "I love the land of the southern part of my country, and I also love the land of the northern part, because it is equally part of our country that must be united as a whole"; "Mother hopes I will become a journalist, and Father hopes I will become a writer, but I am no longer just your two daughters, I want to be the proud daughter of a united country." Is such a daughter a criminal? Will such a daughter harm the country's security? No! 40 million Korean people answer. No! Everyone who cares about the situation on the Korean Peninsula answers.

The world will watch with vigilant eyes how the South Korean authorities treat Lim Su-kyung.

### 访朝归来的思念——回忆南朝鲜女大学生林秀卿北方行

    访朝归来的思念
    ——回忆南朝鲜女大学生林秀卿北方行
    本报记者　余焕春
    林秀卿终于经板门店返回了南方。当她跨过临时军事分界线，转过身来向北方同胞挥手告别的时候，脸上的表情是严峻的，严峻之中又有几分悲怆和愤怒。
    林秀卿作为南朝鲜百万大学生的代表，是6月底辗转经过几个国家秘密来到平壤参加十三届世界青年联欢节的。她此行还有一个崇高的目标——促进7000万同胞实现祖国和平统一的愿望。
    从汉城到平壤，不过300公里路程，乘车4个小时便可到达，可她被迫辗转欧洲，花费了整整10天时间。国土被分割，民族被分离，使她深深感受到国家和人民的不幸和痛苦。林秀卿意识到此行肩负的重任，一到北方就申明，一定要通过板门店回南方，以表达她为统一事业万死不辞的决心。
    7月21日，由30多个国家和地区的400多位代表组成的支持朝鲜半岛和平与统一的国际和平大行军，从朝鲜半岛最北端的白头山出发，计划途经板门店，最终抵达朝鲜半岛最南端的汉拿山。林秀卿是这支队伍中最引人注目的人物。人民日报代表团恰巧在这一天到达平壤，开始对朝鲜作为期10天的访问。“大行军”计划能否实现？林秀卿在板门店能通过临时军事分界线回南方吗？她会不会成为第二个文益焕？这些自然成了我们访问过程中不断提起的话题。
    21日夜里，朝鲜《劳动新闻》外事部部长赵大毅到我们下榻的高丽饭店商量日程，我们提议将访问板门店日期推后两天，即改为27日，以便能够亲眼看到“大行军”队伍到达板门店的场面，以便有机会访问林秀卿。但由于全部日程已排定，牵动比较大，未能如愿。主人表示歉意，我们也感到十分惋惜。
    7月23日，我们乘火车离开平壤去开城访问。途中，赵大毅同志告知，由于南朝鲜当局和军事停战委员会美国方面的阻拦，这次大行军计划恐难完全实现，但林秀卿个人经板门店回南方是阻挡不住的。他说：“林秀卿已下决心，即使抛头颅洒鲜血也在所不惜。她的行动是一个民族意志的体现”。他有点压抑不住内心的激动，声音里充满着自信的力量。就在我们离开平壤的当天，林秀卿和“大行军”队伍已到平壤，准备经沙里院和海州等地去开城，于27日朝鲜停战36周年纪念日到达板门店。这个牵动千万颗心的事件，由于前途未卜，我们代表团全体成员比以前更加关注了。
    27日我们登上了金刚山。时值朝鲜雨季。金刚山被迷蒙的雨雾笼罩着，分外秀丽。我们身在山中，心在板门，“大行军”队伍到达没有？林秀卿能推开板门吗？多美的景色也无法将这些问题从我们思想深处排遣。入夜，我们早早聚在电视机前，准备收看林秀卿和“大行军”队伍到达板门店实况。偏偏不巧，是夜山上风雨交加，电视转播站中途断电，只看到“大行军”队伍到达开城和在板门阁举行集会的场面，关键部分未能看到。据朝鲜同志后来介绍，当时临时军事分界线两侧戒备森严，美军和朝鲜人民军士兵相视而立。林秀卿一行离开板门店一侧的板门，向南方一侧走去，由于南朝鲜当局和美军禁止，林秀卿站在板门前的台阶上，再也不能前行。林秀卿怒不可遏，眼中噙着泪水，仰望南天，发出感人肺腑的呼喊：“这是我的祖国，我们的土地，为什么我不能从这里返回南方？！”这声音至今仍在我耳际回荡。
    我们结束访朝的时候，林秀卿一行在板门阁已经进行了5天绝食斗争，得到国内外广泛同情与支持。我们回到北京第二天，从报上看到林秀卿8月1日声明，宣布停止绝食，并决心在8月15日朝鲜光复四十四周年之际，再度经板门店回南方。
    林秀卿明知那是一条充满荆棘和危险的路，偏要往那条路上走，她的精神和勇气令人感佩。她胜利了，终于如愿以偿，在8月15日经板门店回到了南方，体现了南方百万大学生要在临时军事分界线上建立一条通往统一意志的桥梁的宏愿。
    南朝鲜当局早已扬言，说林秀卿违反《国家安全法》，要对她拘留审查，甚至采取法律措施，判她死刑。林秀卿虽已回南方，但她的命运令人担忧。40年前，金九先生为了反对美帝国主义分裂朝鲜的政策，实现国家的统一，参加了1948年4月在平壤举行的南北联席会议，回到汉城后惨遭暗杀。40年后，南朝鲜著名人士文益焕牧师踏上当年金九先生走过的道路，于今年3月来到平壤，继续他的未竞之业。文益焕返回汉城，飞机尚未着陆，南朝鲜当局便给他扣上违反《国家安全法》的罪名，在机舱里将他逮捕，至今仍监禁狱中。
    现在林秀卿回到了自己的家乡，南方当局立刻用直升机将她押往汉城。林秀卿会否遭遇金九先生和文益焕牧师同样的不幸，但她是无罪的。她的北方之行光明磊落，是一次伟大的爱国壮举。请读一读林秀卿在离开汉城时留给父母的信吧！她写道：“我热爱祖国南半部土地，同时也热爱北半部土地，因为它同样是我们必须统一成为一个整体的祖国”；“妈妈希望我成为记者，爸爸希望我成为作家，但我已不只是你们两位的女儿，我要做统一了的祖国的自豪的女儿。”这样的女儿是罪犯吗？这样的女儿会危害祖国安全吗？不！4000万朝鲜人民这样回答。不！一切关心朝鲜半岛局势的人这样回答。
    南朝鲜当局如何对待林秀卿，举世将以警惕的目光注视着。
