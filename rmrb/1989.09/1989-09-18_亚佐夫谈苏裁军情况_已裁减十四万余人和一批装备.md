    Marshal Yazov Discusses Soviet Arms Reduction
    Over 140,000 Personnel and a Batch of Equipment Already Reduced

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 16 - Since the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR officially issued the order to reduce troops half a year ago, the Soviet military has reduced 148,900 personnel, 6,680 tanks, 1,070 artillery pieces, 40 warships, and 591 aircraft. In addition, by the end of this year, 500 tactical nuclear warheads will be withdrawn from Eastern European countries.

    The above figures were announced by Soviet Defense Minister Yazov in an interview with a reporter from *Izvestia* on September 16.

    Yazov also revealed that by mid-September, the Soviet Union had destroyed 1,259 missiles and 469 launchers according to the Soviet-American Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, accounting for 68% and 57% of the missiles and launchers to be destroyed, respectively. When this treaty is fully implemented, the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces will reduce a total of 68,000 personnel, which means one missile army and eight divisions equipped with SS-4 and SS-20 missiles will be disbanded, and the entire intermediate-range missile force will cease to exist.

    Yazov said that Soviet military production has been reduced by about one-fifth in the past two years, and the arms reduction measures can save 30 billion rubles in expenditure. The civilian product value of the Soviet military industry currently accounts for 40%, reaching 46% in 1991, and exceeding 60% in 1995. At the same time, he emphasized that defense is a field that concentrates on the fundamental interests of the whole nation. Recently, some people have attempted to use reducing defense spending as the sole solution to eliminating budget deficits and solving all current social problems, which is economically unsustainable and politically shortsighted and dangerous. He believes that under the existing real threat of war, the principle of reasonable and sufficient defense requires the continued technical modernization of the armed forces on a new basis, which requires corresponding funds.

　　亚佐夫谈苏裁军情况
　　已裁减十四万余人和一批装备
    据新华社莫斯科9月16日电　自从苏联最高苏维埃主席团正式发布裁军命令半年来，苏军已裁减14.89万人、坦克6680辆、大炮1070门、军舰40艘、飞机591架。此外，到今年年底，还将从东欧国家撤出500枚战术核弹头。
    上述数字是苏联国防部长亚佐夫16日对《消息报》记者发表谈话时宣布的。
    亚佐夫还透露，截至9月中旬，苏联已根据苏美中导条约，销毁了1259枚导弹和469个发射架，分别占应销毁数的68％和57％。当这项条约执行完毕时，苏联的战略火箭军总共将减少6.8万人，即1个导弹集团军和8个装备SS—4和SS—20导弹的师将被撤销，整个中导部队将不复存在。
    亚佐夫说，苏联的军火生产近两年已削减约1／5，裁军措施可节约300亿卢布的开支。苏联军事工业的民品产值目前已占40％，1991年可达到46％，1995年将超过60％。与此同时，他还强调指出，国防是集中体现全民根本利益的领域，最近有人企图将减少国防费用当作消除预算赤字和解决当前所有社会问题的唯一办法，这在经济上是站不住脚的，在政治上是没有远见的和危险的。他认为，在现实的战争危险依然存在的情况下，合理的足够防御原则要求在崭新的基础上继续对武装力量进行技术改装，而这是需要相应的经费的。
