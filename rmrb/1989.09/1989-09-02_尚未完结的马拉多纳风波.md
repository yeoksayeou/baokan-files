Reporters waiting at Buenos Aires International Airport were disappointed again. The football star Diego Maradona, who was scheduled to fly to Rome on August 31, did not appear. What happened to Maradona? Will he return to the Naples club to play football? For more than two weeks, the news media in Italy and Argentina, separated by thousands of miles, have been preoccupied with the same question.

Maradona returned to Argentina to participate in the Copa América. After the tournament and a short vacation, he was supposed to return to Naples in early August, as the Italian national league was about to start. However, by the time the season began, Maradona was still in Buenos Aires, refusing to reveal when he would return to Italy. On August 22, he broke his silence, issuing a statement through his agent, claiming that his home in Naples had been repeatedly harassed, with windows broken and cars damaged. He accused a conspiracy against him and his family in Naples.

The news reached Naples, and the quiet Mediterranean city was in an uproar. The police immediately ordered increased patrols in Maradona's residential area, with a guard every hundred meters. The police chief personally investigated Maradona's home and found that his accusations were unfounded; not a single window was broken, and the four cars in the garage were intact. The people of Naples were outraged. Maradona, who was once beloved and revered in the city, became a pariah overnight. According to reports from Argentine correspondents, the entire city now harbors hostility towards Maradona, accusing him of betrayal and disappointing their goodwill, telling him not to return. A local newspaper published a photo of Maradona drinking with several mafia figures at a wedding, hinting at his connection with the mafia. Some reporters also spread rumors that he was using drugs. These two allegations were denied by the police. However, there are accusations of tax evasion, and the judicial authorities have begun investigating his accounts. Some Italians even vented their anger on the Argentine football team, threatening that the Argentine team would have a hard time in the upcoming World Cup. A few individuals even bought tickets to confront Maradona, but were intercepted by Interpol in Rio de Janeiro.

Insiders know that two months ago, the French Olympique de Marseille club was willing to pay $23 million to "buy" Maradona, with $15 million going to the Naples club as a transfer fee and $8 million to Maradona himself. Naples refused to let him go. It is said that Maradona had a falling out with the Naples club chairman over this matter. Before that, during two matches, Naples fans were dissatisfied with Maradona's performance on the field, whistling at him, and even his wife and daughter were mocked in the stands. Maradona could not take it. These might be the reasons for his delayed return.

Experienced sports commentators believe that if Maradona returns to Naples now and plays a few good games, he can still redeem his image. However, Maradona himself admits that he has not trained for a long time and has gained weight, and it will take at least a month to regain his physical fitness and competitive form. This season, he will not be able to contribute much. Recently, Maradona has often expressed his desire to return to Argentina to play football. The next move of the world's most expensive football star (the Naples club spent $100 million to sign him from Spain) is attracting widespread attention from football fans around the world.

    尚未完结的马拉多纳风波
    守候在布宜诺斯艾利斯国际机场的记者们又一次扑空。原定于8月31日搭机飞罗马的足球明星马拉多纳没有出现。马拉多纳怎么了？还回不回意大利那不勒斯俱乐部踢球？两个多星期来，远隔万里的意大利和阿根廷新闻界被这同一个问题牵动着。
    马拉多纳是返回阿根廷参加美洲杯赛的。赛事结束短期休假之后本应于8月上旬返回那不勒斯，因为意大利全国联赛即将开始。然而直到比赛已经开始，马拉多纳仍然滞留布市，不肯透露何时返回意大利。8月22日，他打破沉默，通过代理人散发一份公报，称他在那不勒斯的家多次受到骚扰，玻璃被打碎汽车被砸。他指控在那不勒斯有一个针对他及家人的阴谋。
    消息传到那不勒斯，这个宁静的地中海小城炸开了锅。警察局立即下令在马拉多纳居住区增派岗哨，一百米一个。局长亲自到马拉多纳家中调查，结果发现他的指控并不符合事实，玻璃一块没碎，车库里4辆汽车完好无损。那不勒斯人愤怒了。在当地备受宠爱和崇拜的马拉多纳一夜之间成了罪人。据阿根廷特派记者发回的报道，现在全城居民对马拉多纳充满敌意，说他背叛了他们，辜负了他们的热情好意，叫他不要再回来了。一家当地报纸刊出了一张马拉多纳在一次婚宴上与本地几个黑手党头面人物一起喝酒的照片，暗指他与黑手党有联系；有的记者还散布他吸毒。这二条倒是被警方否认了。而有人指控他有逃税嫌疑，司法部门真的开始调查他的帐目。有的意大利人还迁怒到阿根廷足球队，扬言明年世界杯赛，阿根廷队在那里将没有好日子过。有几位老兄甚至怒气冲冲地买了机票要找马拉多纳算账，后来在里约热内卢被国际刑警截回。
    了解内幕的人知道，二个月前，法国马赛奥林匹克俱乐部愿意出2300万美元把马拉多纳“买”过去，1500万给那不勒斯俱乐部作为转会费，800万给马拉多纳本人。那不勒斯拒绝出让。据说马拉多纳因此事与那不勒斯俱乐部主席闹翻。这之前，有二场比赛那不勒斯人对马拉多纳场上表现不满，向他吹口哨，看台上马拉多纳的妻子和女儿也受到嘲哄。马拉多纳受不了这种气。这些可能是他迟迟不归的原因。
    有经验的体育评论员认为，如果马拉多纳现在返回那不勒斯，踢几场好球，还能挽回影响。但是马拉多纳自己承认，他好久没有训练，体重增加，要恢复体力和良好竞技状态，至少得一个月。这一赛季他实际出不了什么力了。马拉多纳近来还时常流露出想回到阿根廷踢球的愿望。这个世界上最贵的球星（当年那不勒斯俱乐部花了1000万美元从西班牙把他挖到）下一步作何打算，正引起世界各地球迷们的广泛注意。
