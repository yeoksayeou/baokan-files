	North Korea has recently discovered three white house swallows. Generally, house swallows are blackish-brown in color, but this spring, a pair of ordinary house swallows returned from the south and settled in a farmer's home in the village of Juphung in this county. They laid four eggs for the first time, from which one white baby swallow hatched. For the second time, they laid five eggs, and two more white baby swallows hatched. These white swallows have the same calls, flying, feeding, and nesting habits as ordinary house swallows. According to North Korean historical records, several hundred years ago, white house swallows, white magpies, and white pheasants were discovered. Locals regard the appearance of white house swallows as an auspicious sign. Currently, relevant departments in North Korea are paying special attention to and protecting these white house swallows.

    朝鲜发现白色家燕
    一般的家燕都呈黑褐色，但朝鲜最近发现了3只白色的燕子。今年春天从南方返回来的一对普通家燕，在这个郡的杼丰里一农民家里落户。它们第一次生卵4枚，其中孵出一只白色的小燕子。第二次生卵5枚，又孵出了两只小白燕。这些白燕子的叫声、飞翔、摄食和筑巢等生活习性与一般家燕完全相同。据朝鲜历史记载，几百年前曾发现过白家燕、白喜鹊和白雉，当地人们把白家燕的出现看作是吉祥的象征。目前，朝鲜有关部门对这些白色家燕给予了特别的关心与保护。 　（新华社）
