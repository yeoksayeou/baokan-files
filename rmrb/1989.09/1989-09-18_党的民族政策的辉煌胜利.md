The great People's Republic of China has been established for 40 years, and Guangxi, located in the southern border of the motherland, has undergone fundamental changes in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. This is a glorious victory of the Party's ethnic policy.

Before liberation, Guangxi was a relatively backward agricultural province. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the various levels of party and government leadership in Guangxi, along with the broad masses of cadres and the people, have adhered to the Party's ethnic policy, united and struggled, and worked hard to build the country. Especially since the establishment of the autonomous region in 1958, Guangxi has implemented various policies and guidelines of ethnic regional autonomy in accordance with the actual situation of the region, vigorously developed the productive forces of society, and gradually formed a relatively complete industrial system. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all developed. By 1988, the total social output value of the entire autonomous region reached 56 billion yuan, of which the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 44.07 billion yuan (all calculated at current prices). Of the total industrial and agricultural output value, the total industrial output value reached 27.18 billion yuan, an increase of 93 times over 1950, with the total industrial output value accounting for 69.4% of the total industrial and agricultural output value; the total agricultural output value reached 16.89 billion yuan, an increase of 4.5 times over 1950.

Under the socialist system, the Zhuang, Han, Yao, Miao, and other 12 ethnic minorities in Guangxi have established a new type of ethnic relationship. The idea that "the Han nationality cannot do without ethnic minorities, and ethnic minorities cannot do without the Han nationality" has taken root in people's minds. People of all ethnic groups have worked closely together in the common cause of building socialism. The close unity of all ethnic groups has promoted political stability and unity throughout the autonomous region. During the period of turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing this year, the situation in Guangxi was generally stable, with only a few places experiencing minor disturbances. In the struggle to resolutely resist foreign aggression, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have made significant contributions to defending the border and maintaining the unity of the motherland.

In implementing the Party's ethnic policy, we have taken the development of ethnic education and the improvement of the cultural and scientific level of ethnic minorities as the fundamental task to promote the prosperity and progress of ethnic regions. By 1988, the entire autonomous region had 573,000 technical personnel in all types of state-owned enterprises, forming a certain scale of scientific and technological team; there were 18,360 schools of all levels, with 6.79 million students enrolled, of which 24 were colleges and universities, with 38,000 students enrolled, an increase of 37 times over 1950. The region has formed a multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form social education network. The number of medical and health personnel has increased from 30,000 in 1950 to 104,000, an increase of 33.6 times, changing the backward situation of Guangxi in the past where there were few doctors and medicines.

Guangxi is the third-largest overseas Chinese region in the country and is also a coastal region, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, and facing Southeast Asia, with extremely favorable conditions for opening up to the outside world. Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, we have gradually utilized these favorable conditions to expand opening up to the outside world. Currently, economic and trade relations have been established with more than 90 countries and regions around the world. In 1988, the total import and export volume of foreign trade reached $808 million, of which the export volume reached $544 million.

The Party's ethnic policy has gradually brought prosperity to Guangxi. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi will, under the glorious guidance of the Party's ethnic policy, march towards the future.

    党的民族政策的辉煌胜利
　　中共广西壮族自治区委员会书记　陈辉光
　　广西壮族自治区人民政府主席　韦纯束
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立40年来，位于祖国南疆的广西，政治、经济、文化各方面都发生了根本的变化。这是党的民族政策的辉煌胜利。
    解放前的广西，是一个比较落后的农业省。解放后，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，广西各级党政领导和广大干部群众，坚持党的民族政策，团结奋斗，艰苦创业。特别是1958年成立自治区后，广西结合本区实际，执行民族区域自治的各项方针政策，大力发展社会生产力，使全区逐步形成比较完整的工业体系，农林牧副渔全面发展。到1988年，全自治区社会总产值达560亿元，其中工农业总产值达440.7亿元（均按当年价计算）。在工农业总产值中，工业总产值达271.8亿元，比1950年增长93倍，工业总产值占工农业总产值的比重达69.4％；农业总产值达168.9亿元，比1950年增长4.5倍。
    在社会主义制度下，广西的壮、汉、瑶、苗等12个兄弟民族建立了新型的民族关系。“汉族离不开少数民族，少数民族离不开汉族”的思想深入人心，各族人民在共同建设社会主义事业中，亲密无间，团结合作。各民族的亲密团结促进了全自治区政治上的安定团结，在今年北京发生学潮、动乱到反革命暴乱期间，广西的局势总的是稳定的，只是一些地方一度曾出现小的动乱。广西各族人民在坚决抗御外国侵略的斗争中，也为保卫边疆、维护祖国的统一作出了重大贡献。
    在贯彻落实党的民族政策中，我们把发展民族教育，提高少数民族人民的文化科学水平，当作促进民族地区繁荣进步的根本大计来抓。到1988年，全自治区全民所有制单位各类技术人员达57.3万人，已形成一定规模的科技队伍；共有大中小学校18360所，在校学生679万人，其中高等学校24所，在校学生3.8万人，比1950年增长37倍。全区已形成多渠道、多层次、多形式的社会教育网。卫生技术人员由1950年的0.3万人增加到10.4万人，增长33.6倍，改变了广西过去缺医少药的落后状况。
    广西是全国第三大侨乡，又是沿海地区，临近港澳，面向东南亚，对外开放有着极为有利的条件。改革开放10年来，我们逐步利用这些有利条件，扩大对外开放。目前，已同世界上90多个国家和地区建立经济和贸易关系，1988年外贸进出口总额达8.08亿美元，其中出口额达5.44亿美元。
    党的民族政策使广西逐步繁荣，广西各族人民将在党的民族政策光辉指引下，走向明天。
