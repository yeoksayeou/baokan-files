Thunderous applause and joyous cheers filled the air at a banquet held by Cypriot President Vasiliou in the capital, Nicosia, where it was announced that four stolen paintings would be returned to their home country.

These four mosaics, created over 1,300 years ago, are Byzantine-style art treasures. The paintings depict the young Jesus and his disciples, including Matthew. In 1974, the four paintings were stolen from a church in northern Cyprus and subsequently ended up in foreign hands, changing owners several times. Last year, an American art dealer purchased them for $1.08 million. When this American art dealer expressed his intention to resell the paintings for $20 million, the Cypriot side discovered the lost ancient paintings and demanded their return. The case went to court in the United States, and the Cypriot side argued their case vigorously, even hiring lawyers. Due to the overwhelming evidence, a court in Indianapolis, Indiana, ruled in early August that the American art dealer must return the four ancient paintings to Cyprus. The art treasures will be returned to their rightful owner.

    物归原主
    掌声如雷，欢声动地，这是塞浦路斯总统瓦西利乌在首都尼科西亚举行的一次晚会上宣布四幅被盗卖的古画将归还本国时的场面。
    这四幅具有拜占庭风格的镶嵌画是一千三百多年前创作的艺术珍品。画面上表现的是青少年时期的耶稣及其门徒马太等的形象。1974年，这四幅画被人从塞浦路斯北部一个教堂里盗走，后来流落异乡，几经转手，于去年被一名美国艺术品收购商以108万美元的价钱买走。当这名美国艺术品商表示要以2000万美元的高价将画转卖时，塞浦路斯方面发现了流失国外的古画并要求归还。官司打到了美国法院，塞浦路斯方面据理力争，为此还聘请了律师。由于证据确凿，今年8月初，美国印第安纳波利斯市的一家法院作出裁决，美国艺术品商人必须将其购买的四幅古画归还给塞浦路斯。艺术珍品将物归原主。　（吴迎春编译）
