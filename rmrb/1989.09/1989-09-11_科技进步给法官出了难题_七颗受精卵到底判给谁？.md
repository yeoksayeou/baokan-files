Technological advancements have presented a significant challenge for judges – who should get the seven fertilized eggs?

A recent case in the circuit court of Blount County, Tennessee, has Judge Dale Young grappling with a unique dilemma. This issue is not only unprecedented for Judge Young but also for the entire state of Tennessee and the whole of the United States.

Divorce cases are common in the U.S., but the complexity of the Davis divorce case does not stem from either party's reluctance to divorce or the difficulty of dividing property. Instead, the crux of the matter lies in both spouses' desire to control the fate of their seven jointly-owned fertilized eggs.

Ten years ago, 30-year-old Junior Louis Davis and 28-year-old Mary Sue Davis got married. After six years of marriage, they decided to undergo artificial insemination at the East Tennessee Fertilization Center, combining Mary's eggs with Junior's sperm in a test tube. By the end of last year, two of the fertilized eggs were implanted into Mary's body, but the pregnancy failed. The remaining seven fertilized eggs were frozen in liquid nitrogen, awaiting the right moment. Unfortunately, the couple's marriage hit a rough patch, leading to this dispute.

During the court hearing, the couple held firm to their respective stances, neither willing to yield. Mary argued that she is "the mother of those embryos" and that the fertilized eggs are "the beginning of life." She emphasized that this is her only chance to have a child and demanded that the fertilized eggs be awarded to her. Junior, however, firmly opposed Mary's sole control over the fertilized eggs, stating that no one has the right to force him to become a father and bear the social and economic responsibilities that come with it. He insisted on joint custody of the fertilized eggs, with their fate to be decided through mutual agreement.

The lawyers and supporters on both sides were equally resolute, each presenting their arguments with conviction. One side contended that the fertilized eggs cannot be considered offspring, equating embryos with fetuses only complicates matters. They argued that Junior has the right to decide whether, when, and with whom to have children, and that Mary should relinquish the fertilized eggs, as she still has the opportunity to give birth in the future. The opposing side asserted that the fertilized eggs are potential human offspring and have the right to be born. They argued that Mary has the right to keep them because she has undergone multiple surgeries and has paid a higher physical and emotional price.

The judge is left in a difficult position, with both sides presenting valid arguments. On the surface, the dispute revolves around the seven fertilized eggs, but the case has extended beyond the legal realm into moral, ethical, medical, and social psychological issues.

Since the successful development of "test-tube baby" technology in the U.S. in 1986, public opinion has been divided on whether fertilized eggs are considered life. One faction, led by the Roman Catholic Church, believes that destroying these fertilized eggs is akin to abortion, taking the lives of "unborn humans." Opponents, including many in the scientific community, argue that fertilization is not an instantaneous process but a complex one. Even without artificial fertilization, the natural conception rate is less than 1/3, so it is not simple to equate fertilized eggs with offspring; they are merely cells before the formation of an embryo.

If, according to current U.S. laws, these frozen fertilized eggs are not recognized as life, the following questions arise: Can they be used for scientific experiments? Can they be destroyed if not needed? Are they considered property? Can they be transferred? How should they be divided in the event of a divorce? If the life rights of these test-tube embryos are recognized, then should a couple with multiple fertilized eggs be required to bring them all to term? How should they be handled if one or both spouses die? If the fertilized eggs die due to an accident or technical reasons (currently, the pregnancy rate for implanted fertilized eggs is only 10%), is it considered "murder"? Who is responsible? These issues all need to be addressed.

Currently, there are 200 medical institutions nationwide engaged in "test-tube baby" work, with 4,000 frozen fertilized eggs. However, the issue of marital separation or death has rarely been considered. It is no wonder that the Davis divorce case has sparked public outcry: scientific and technological advancements have far outpaced the law, and society must respond to this challenge. However, the ultimate fate of these seven small fertilized eggs may take several more years to be determined.

### 科技进步给法官出了难题——七颗受精卵到底判给谁？

　　科技进步给法官出了难题
　　——七颗受精卵到底判给谁？
　　本报记者　仓立德
    美国田纳西州布朗特县巡回法院法官戴尔·扬，最近在审理戴维斯夫妻离婚案中遇到一个大难题。这个难题不要说这位法官未见过，在田纳西乃至整个美国也属史无前例。
    离婚案在美国本是司空见惯，但戴维斯夫妻案的棘手处既非一方不愿离异，也非锅碗瓢盆等财产难以分割，而是夫妇双方都想得到他们共有的7颗人工试管受精卵的处置权。
    现年30岁的朱尼尔·路易斯·戴维斯与28岁的玛丽·苏·戴维斯10年前结为伉俪。婚后6年苦于膝下无子，便商定由东田纳西授精中心将玛丽的卵子与朱尼尔的精子在试管中人工结合。去年底，这个中心将两颗受精卵植入玛丽体内，但怀孕失败。另外尚有7颗冷藏在液氮中等待时机，没想到却遇上两口子婚变，纠纷由此而生。
    在法院听证会上，夫妻各执一端，互不相让。玛丽认为自己是“那些胚胎的母亲”，那些受精卵是“生命的起始，无限期冷藏等于害他们的命”，她强调这是她此生养孩子的唯一机会，因此要求将受精卵判给她。朱尼尔则坚决不同意让女方单独处置这些受精卵，因为别人无权强迫他作父亲并承担对后代的社会和经济责任。他要求与玛丽共同监护这些受精卵，其命运只能通过双方协议来决定。
    双方的律师及其支持者更是旗帜鲜明，针锋相对。一方认为那些受精卵根本不能看作后代，“将胚胎与胎儿相题并论把事情搅得乱七八糟”；在是否要、何时要、与谁要孩子的问题上，朱尼尔有当然决定权；玛丽应放弃那些受精卵，她今后还有机会生育……另一方宣称这些受精卵是生命，至少是“潜在的人类后代”，应有出世的权利；玛丽有权要，因为她承受了数次手术，在身体上和感情上付出的代价更大。
    公说公有理，婆说婆有理，不能不令法官左右为难。表面上看来，双方争论的焦点是那7颗人工受精卵，实际上此案已超出“没有先例”的法律范围，而涉及到许多道德、伦理、医学、社会心理等方面的严肃问题。
    美国自1986年发展“试管婴儿”技术成功以来，公众舆论在人工受精卵是否是生命的问题上形成对立的两大派。以罗马天主教会为代表的一派持肯定态度，认为毁掉这些受精卵就像堕胎一样害死了“未出生的人类生命”。包括科技界许多人士在内的反对者则认为受孕不是一刹那，而是一个复杂的过程；即便是非人工受精卵，其自然成孕率亦不足1／3，因此不能简单地将受精卵视为后代，它们只是胚胎形成前的细胞而已。
    如果按照美国现行法律那样不承认这些冷藏的人工受精卵是生命，随之而来的问题是：能否将它们用于科学试验？不需要的能否销毁？是否是财产？能否转让？夫妻离异后该如何分割？如果这些试管胚胎的生命权利得以承认，那么，假如一对夫妇有许多人工受精卵，是否必须让他们一一出世？如夫妻双方或一方去世，如何处置？如因事故或技术原因（目前人工受精卵植入体内的成孕率只有10％）而造成的受精卵死亡是否算“害命”？谁承担责任？……上述种种，都亟待回答。
    目前全美已有200家医疗机构从事“试管婴儿”工作，冷藏的人工受精卵已达4000颗，但很少考虑夫妻婚变或死亡问题。难怪戴维斯离婚案一出，舆论界大呼：科学技术已远远走在了法律的前头，社会对此必须作出回答的时刻到了！不过这7颗小小人工受精卵的最终命运，恐怕还要几年才可见分晓。
