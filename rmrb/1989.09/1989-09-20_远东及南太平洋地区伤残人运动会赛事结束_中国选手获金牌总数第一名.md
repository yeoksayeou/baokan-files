The Fifth Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled concluded today. Chinese athletes secured a total of 99 gold medals, placing them at the top of the standings. In the 10 track and field events that Chinese athletes participated in today, they won 9 gold medals and broke one world record for the disabled.

Today, a typhoon made landfall in the Kobe area, bringing heavy rain and a sudden drop in temperature. Visibility on the track was extremely low. Despite the extreme fatigue from consecutive days of competition and the harsh weather conditions, Chinese athletes overcame these challenges to win 9 gold medals, 1 silver medal, and 4 bronze medals in the 10 events they competed in. The gold medalists and their achievements are as follows: Wang Jianqing, men's A6-8 level long jump, 6.15 meters; Qiu Xuewen, men's A7 level long jump, 5.60 meters; Li Jifeng, A2 level long jump, 5.60 meters; Huang Wentao, men's B2 level triple jump, 12.11 meters; Wang Chaohong, men's B1 level triple jump, 7.60 meters; Ke Yuxian, women's A2 level shot put, 5.56 meters; Wu Hongping, women's A6-8 level shot put, 8.60 meters; Ma Qiaoyun, women's B2 level 800-meter run, 2 minutes 40.51 seconds. Liu Yukun broke the world record for the disabled in the women's A3 level shot put with a throw of 7.03 meters, securing the gold medal.

Upon hearing that the Chinese delegation, consisting of 56 athletes, had won the most gold medals, Dr. Fang Xinran, son of a famous anti-Japanese war general and president of the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled Federation, congratulated the Chinese delegation and said, "China is amazing, Chinese athletes are the best." The Australian team, consisting of 158 athletes, won 74 gold medals, placing them second. The Japanese delegation, consisting of 545 athletes, won 72 gold medals, placing them third. This is the first time Chinese athletes have won the most gold medals in the history of their participation in the Games for the Disabled.

The Chinese delegation is the only team among the participating countries that was sent with funding from the state. Foreign athletes envied the attention and generous support that Chinese athletes received from the state, as well as the concern shown by various sectors of Chinese society. The spirit of Chinese athletes with disabilities was highly praised locally.

    今天台风在神户地区登陆，大雨倾盆，气温骤降，田径场内能见度极低。我选手克服连日比赛的极度疲劳和恶劣气候的困难，在参赛的10项田径比赛中获得9枚金牌、1枚银牌、4枚铜牌。获得金牌的选手和成绩是：王建清男子A6—8级跳远6.15米，仇学文男子A7级跳远5.60米，李继丰A2级跳远5.60米，黄文涛男子B2级三级跳远12.11米，王超雄男子B1级三级跳远7.60米，柯玉仙女子A2级铅球5.56米，吴红萍女子A6—8级铅球8.60米，马巧云女子B2级800米跑2分40秒51。刘玉坤在女子A3级铅球比赛中，以7.03米打破这个项目的伤残人世界纪录，获得金牌。
    听说由56名选手组成的中国代表团夺取金牌总数第一名，著名抗日将领之子、远东及南太平洋伤残人运动会联合会主席方心让博士向中国代表团表示祝贺，并说：“中国了不起，中国运动员第一。”由158名选手组成的澳大利亚队获74枚金牌，居第2位。545名选手组成的日本代表团获72枚金牌，名列第3。中国选手获金牌总数第1名，是中国参加历次伤残人运动会以来第1次。
