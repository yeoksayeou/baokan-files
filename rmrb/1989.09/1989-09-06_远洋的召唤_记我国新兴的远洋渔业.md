The 10th of March, 1985, is a day worth recording in the history of China's fisheries. On this day, a fleet of 13 vessels organized by the China Fisheries Corporation and relevant provinces and cities, flying the vibrant five-star red flag, set sail from Fuzhou's Mawei Port towards the waters off West Africa, marking the beginning of China's deep-sea fishing industry.

As the departing vessels sounded their horns and slowly left the port, many people shed tears of excitement. Zhang Yanxi, the general manager of the China Fisheries Corporation, a veteran of 30 years in the fisheries industry, remarked, "When I was a student in the 1950s, I saw the phrase 'Develop China's deep-sea fishing industry' in recruitment brochures. This slogan has been shouted for 20 to 30 years, and it is only in this era of reform that it has become a reality."

The world's oceans cover 360 million square kilometers, but most fish resources are concentrated in waters less than 200 meters deep, which account for only 10% of the total area. This uneven distribution of fish resources forces many countries to fish in the high seas or on the continental shelves of other countries, which is what deep-sea fishing is all about. Deep-sea fishing is an essential part of coastal countries' fisheries, and its presence or absence reflects a country's fisheries level.

Although we are late to the game, there are still plenty of options. The high seas are rich in resources.

The difficult first step has been taken. When our fishing fleet entered the high seas, people were overjoyed, but upon seeing our "neighbors" in the deep-sea fishing industry, they were surprised: since the 1950s, the deep-sea fishing industries of the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea have all experienced three major developments, with their production now accounting for about one-third of their total fisheries output, becoming a significant source of foreign exchange and a pillar of their economies. Some countries even use Chinese-made fishing vessels to enter the high seas before us.

Indeed, we are late to the party. During the days of "freedom of the high seas," we were closed off from the world and did not venture out. After others had fished for several decades, the world generally implemented a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, and coastal countries began to restrict foreign fishing vessels in their economic zones. We are now fishing in the waters near other countries, so what kind of harvest can we expect? Four years of practice have gradually dispelled these concerns. Although most of the resources on the continental shelves of the world have been developed and utilized, the utilization situation is very uneven. In terms of certain sea areas, there is still potential.

A comrade from Ningbo Marine Fisheries Company who had fished in Iran said that the fisheries resources in Iran's waters are very rich, with a net full of both scaled and scaleless fish. Due to religious beliefs and customs, locals do not eat scaleless fish like anchovies and squid, which account for about half of the total catch and are discarded back into the sea. This is a great pity for us Chinese, who eat all kinds of fish. It is said that the situation in Argentina is even more pronounced. This livestock country's people mainly eat beef and eat little fish, so the richness of their fisheries resources is imaginable.

After more than 30 years of development, China's fisheries industry has formed a relatively complete system of production, research, education, operation, and service, with abundant fisheries labor and relatively low labor costs, giving it a certain competitive advantage. After the fishing vessels of the Dalian Deep-Sea Fisheries Company arrived at the Gulf of Guinea in Gabon, they quickly discovered three fishing grounds. The fisheries resources there are indeed quite good. Along a single line, repeatedly dragging the net back and forth, 6 nets a day, continuously dragging for 16 days, with an average catch of over 1,000 kilograms per net, mostly high-quality fish. China's fishing vessels encountered similar situations almost everywhere along the coast of West Africa, where the resources are comparable to the level of China's coastal fisheries resources in the 1950s.

A mutually beneficial industry that everyone is concerned about, as long as it is not a "one-sided affair," the high seas welcome us.

From the outset, China's deep-sea fishing industry has focused on various forms of international fisheries cooperation, becoming a mutually beneficial industry that everyone is concerned about, and taking a path of equality and mutual benefit. Many developing countries have had good relations with China and are eager to cooperate with us in fisheries. At the same time, some countries with developed fisheries hope to utilize China's low-wage labor and cooperate with us.

The forms of cooperation are diverse. Taking the three West African countries that first established fishing cooperation with China as an example, cooperation with Senegal is in the form of a joint venture, with the Chinese side providing the vessels and personnel, and the other side responsible for land services and local sales. Chinese fishing vessels fishing in the waters of Sierra Leone go through local agents to handle applications and related procedures. With Guinea-Bissau, a government-level fisheries agreement was signed, allowing Chinese fishing vessels to fish in their waters upon payment of taxes, while we help them build a batch of motorized fishing vessels locally and are responsible for technology transfer and personnel training. It is remembered that when we built 6 motorized fishing vessels with 135 horsepower for Guinea-Bissau, their president visited the site three times; when the first motorized vessel was launched, it caused a sensation throughout Guinea-Bissau. Their secretary of state said, "You have given Guinea-Bissau its first semi-industrial fleet. The cooperation is sincere, and the cooperation project is successful." After we stood firm in West Africa for more than a year, dozens of other countries came knocking on our door, inviting us to their waters for joint fisheries ventures.

Currently, China has dispatched nearly 100 fishing vessels and more than 2,000 crew members and land-based personnel to the waters of more than 10 countries in West Africa, North America, South America, and the Southwest Pacific to engage in fisheries production and operations, forming an annual fishing capacity of more than 100,000 tons. In the past four years, the China Fisheries Corporation alone has brought back 53,000 tons of deep-sea fish, with the highest amount last year at 32,000 tons, and the fish quality is good, deeply loved by consumers.

Deep-sea fishing is not just about catching fish; fishing vessels are also schools and exhibition halls, with many things to do.

Many people only learned about China's deep-sea fishing industry from the fish counters in big city markets in recent years. In reality, the deep-sea fishing industry has given us much more than a few "foreign fish."

When we did not venture out of the country, having fish meant making money; when a fishing vessel goes out, the family is concerned about how much fish it caught. Now, the fishing vessels have gone overseas, and people ask us how much money this ship of fish sold for; different fish species, different processing methods, and different qualities result in vastly different prices. In the beginning, we did not understand these things, and sometimes the fish we caught could only be treated as garbage. This forced everyone to learn. Where to fish, what to fish, all require learning. We even invited foreign experts to go to sea with us, helping to adjust the fish processing machinery and guide the mastery of operating techniques. By learning humbly and working hard, the production and quality quickly improved, and the export price per ton increased by several hundred dollars. Many fish deals are made in the high seas. Chinese fishing vessels often dock with foreign transport ships to unload cargo. Hundreds of tons of fish fillets, fish blocks, fish roe, fish meal, and other fish products flow through this channel to North America, Western Europe, Japan, and other global markets.

In the past, our fishing vessels circled around the coastal waters like fishing in a fish tank, catching less and less fish; the equipment on the boats also became more and more outdated and backward. To meet the needs of the development of deep-sea fishing, we began to equip advanced medium and large fishing vessels, installing fish school scanning sonars, current meters, net position indicators, and other fishing navigation aids on the vessels. The situation of relying on the naked eye to find fish, relying on experience to fish, and having nine empty nets out of ten began to change. Wherever our fishing vessels go, an exhibition is held.

The prospects for China's deep-sea fishing industry, which has just started for four years, are promising. Seizing the current opportunity, with more policy and financial support from the state, and making it an important part of developing an export-oriented economy, it will undoubtedly have an immeasurable impact and effect.

    远洋的召唤
    ——记我国新兴的远洋渔业
    本报记者  黄彩忠
    1985年3月10日，在我国渔业史上是一个值得大书一笔的日子。正是在这一天，由中国水产联合总公司和有关省市组建的，拥有13艘渔轮的船队，悬挂鲜艳的五星红旗，飘洋过海驶往西非海域，拉开了我国渔业发展史上远洋渔业的序幕。
    当西征的渔轮鸣笛起航，缓缓离开福建马尾港时，多少人流出了激动的泪水。中国水产联合总公司总经理张延喜，这位30年的“老水产”说：“我在50年代上学时，就在招生简章上看到过‘发展我国远洋渔业’的词句，这口号喊了二三十年，直到当今这改革的年代才成为现实。”
    世界海洋面积3.6亿平方公里，大部分鱼类资源却集中在水深200米以内、面积只占10％的海域。这种鱼类资源分布的不平衡性，使许多国家的渔船不得不到公海或别国近海大陆架作业，这就是远洋渔业。远洋渔业，是沿海国家渔业不可缺少的组成部分，它的有无与发达程度，体现一个国家渔业的水平。
    虽然赶了一个“晚集”，可供“选购”的东西仍然不少，远洋有着丰富的资源
    艰难的第一步终于迈出去了。当我们的捕捞船队进入公海，人们高兴之余，瞧瞧远洋渔业的“邻居们”，不免又大吃一惊：50年代以来，苏联、日本、南朝鲜的远洋渔业都经历了三次大的发展，其产量目前已占整个渔业产量的1／3左右，成为这些国家创汇渔业和经济支柱的一部分。有的国家甚至是利用我国生产的渔船，而先于我们进入远洋捕捞。
    确实是赶了一个“晚集”。“公海自由”的年月里，我们闭关锁国没有“打”出去。在别人“扫荡”了几十年之后，世界普遍实行了200海里经济专属区，沿海各国相继限制外国渔船在经济区内捕鱼；我们在这个时候跑到别的国家附近海域去打鱼，能有什么收获呢？4年的实践逐渐消除了人们的担心。尽管目前世界各大陆架资源大多已开发利用，但利用情况很不平衡，就某些海区而言，尚有潜力。
    曾到伊朗捕鱼的宁波海洋渔业公司的同志说，伊朗海域的渔业资源很丰富，一网拉上来，有鳞的、无鳞的鱼都有。由于宗教信仰和习惯上的原因，当地人不吃带鱼、墨鱼等无鳞鱼，约占总捕获量一半的无鳞鱼只得挑出来，倒回大海。这对我们不管“有鳞”、“无鳞”，是鱼都吃的中国人来讲，真是太可惜了。据说，类似的情况阿根廷更甚，这个畜牧国家的人民以吃牛肉为主，鱼吃的很少，那里的渔业资源丰富程度可想而知。
    我国渔业经过30多年的建设，已形成生产、科研、教育、经营、服务等较为完善配套的体系，而且渔业劳力充足，劳务费用较低，具有一定的竞争能力。大连远洋渔业公司的渔轮抵达加蓬的几内亚湾后，很快探出3个渔场。那里的渔业资源状况确实比较好，沿着一个趟子（一条线）来回反复拖网，一天6网，连拖16天，平均网产1000多公斤，且多为优质鱼。我国渔轮在西非沿岸几乎处处遇到这种情况，那里的资源相当于50年代中国沿海水产资源的水平。
    共同关注的互利事业，只要不是“剃头担子一头热”，远洋欢迎我们
    我国远洋渔业一起步，就认准了国际间各种形式的渔业合作，已成为共同关注的互利事业，走着一条平等互利的路。许多发展中国家同我国的关系一直较好，迫切希望同我们进行渔业合作。同时，一些渔业发达的国家也希望利用我国低薪劳力，同我们进行合作。
    合作形式是多种多样的，仅以最早与我国建立捕鱼合作关系的西非3国为例，与塞内加尔的合作是采取合资公司的形式，中方出船出人，对方负责陆上服务和在当地销售。我国渔船在塞拉利昂海域捕鱼是通过当地代理人办理申请等有关手续。跟几内亚比绍则签订了政府间渔业协定，几方允许中国渔船在其海域缴税捕鱼，我们则帮助他们在当地建一批机动渔船，并负责传授技术、培训人员。记得当初为几内亚比绍建造6艘135马力的机动渔船时，他们的总统曾3次亲临现场视察；当第一条机动船下水时，轰动了整个几内亚比绍，他们的国务秘书说：“你们使几内亚比绍第一次有了半工业化船队，合作是真诚的，合作项目是成功的。”我们在西非站稳脚跟一年多后，又有几十个国家主动找上门来，请我们去他们的海域合营渔业。
    目前，我国已派出近百艘渔船、两千余名船员和陆地工作人员，分布在西非、北美、南美、西南太平洋10多个国家的海域从事渔业生产和经营活动，并已形成年捕鱼10多万吨的生产经营能力。4年来，仅中国水产联合总公司就运回5.3万吨远洋鱼货，其中去年最多，达3.2万吨，而且鱼货质量好，深受消费者欢迎。
    远洋渔业不只是光捕鱼，渔轮既是学校又可办展览，要做的事情还很多
    不少人是从近几年大城市菜场的鱼货柜台上见到“外国鱼”，才知道我国的远洋渔业。其实，远洋渔业给予我们的，岂止几条“外国鱼”。
    当我们未走出国门时，有鱼就能卖钱；一条渔船开出去，回来时家人关心是打了多少鱼。如今，渔轮开到了海外，人家向我们打听的是你这一船鱼卖了多少钱；鱼种不同，加工方法、质量不一样，价格有着天壤之别。开始阶段，我们不懂这些，有时打回的鱼只能当垃圾处理。这就逼着大家学习。在哪里捕鱼，捕什么鱼，都得学习。甚至请外国专家随船出海，帮助调节鱼品加工机械，指导掌握操作技术。虚心学，努力干，很快产量、质量都上去了，外销价格每吨提高几百美元。不少鱼生意在公海里就做开了，我国的渔轮经常靠上外国运输船卸货，成百成千吨的鱼片、鱼块、鱼籽、鱼粉等鱼产品，从这条通道流往北美、西欧、日本等世界市场。
    过去，我们的渔船围绕近海转圈，就像在鱼缸里捞鱼，越捞越少；船上的设备也越捞越陈旧、落后。适应远洋渔业发展的需要，我们开始装备先进的大中型渔轮，什么鱼群扫描声机、潮流计、网位仪等助渔导航设备都装上了渔轮，靠肉眼找鱼、凭经验打鱼、十网九空的状况开始改变了。我们的渔轮走到哪里，展览会就开到哪里。
    我国刚起步4年的远洋渔业发展前景乐观，抓紧利用当前的机遇，国家从政策上、资金上更多一点扶持，把它作为发展外向型经济的重要组成部分，必将产生不可低估的影响和效果。
