By simply changing the method of rice cultivation, one mu of rice field can save about 9 kilograms of seeds, one-third of the water, and 30 yuan of investment, while increasing the yield by 100 kilograms per mu. This advanced technology of dry-seeding and sparse planting for cold-region rice has already gained momentum in rural areas of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces.

The State Science and Technology Commission recently decided to allocate special funds for scientific research and promotion to support the dry-seeding and sparse planting technology and to make a plan for promoting this technology in Northeast, North China, and Northwest China from 1990 to 1992.

The dry-seeding and sparse planting technology for rice was first introduced from Japan to Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province, in 1981. This technology is very suitable for rice cultivation in northern China. Its characteristics include changing from water-seeding to dry-seeding, from dense planting to sparse planting, from deep irrigation to shallow irrigation, and from top-dressing to full-season fertilization, with a focus on phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and control of nitrogen fertilizers. In 1981, Fangzheng County applied this technology to 27 mu of rice fields, and the yield per mu reached 347.5 kilograms in the autumn, which was 184 kilograms more than the direct-seeding fields using the same variety in the same area. Last year, all 274,000 mu of rice fields in the county adopted this technology, with an average yield of 457.5 kilograms per mu.

The State Science and Technology Commission decided to promote the dry-seeding and sparse planting technology in the "Three North" regions from 1990 to 1992, with a promotion area of 140 to 150 million mu, accounting for about 30% to 40% of the current rice area in the "Three North" regions. According to conservative estimates, if the yield per mu increases by 50 to 70 kilograms, it can achieve an annual increase of 7.5 to 10.5 billion kilograms of rice, generating 6 to 8.4 billion yuan in revenue. At the same time, it can save 3.4 billion yuan in costs for seeds, water, electricity, and oil.

    寒地水稻旱育稀植先进技术
    国家科委将拨款在三北推广
    据新华社北京9月4日电　（记者范平）只要改变一下水稻栽培方法，一亩稻田就可节省9公斤左右的种子、1／3的水和30元的投入，还使亩产增产100公斤。这项寒地水稻旱育稀植技术，目前已在我国黑龙江、内蒙古、辽宁、河北、陕西、山西等地农村形成了不推而广的势头。
    国家科委最近决定，拨出科研推广专款扶持旱育稀植技术并做出1990年至1992年在我国东北、华北、西北地区推广这项技术的规划。
    水稻旱育稀植技术，最早由黑龙江省方正县于1981年从日本引进。这项技术很适合我国北方水稻栽培，特点是由水育苗改为旱育苗；由密植改为稀植；由深灌水改为浅灌水；由追肥改为全程施肥，并重施磷钾肥，控制氮肥。方正县1981年在27亩稻田采用此项技术，秋后亩产达347.5公斤，比当地用同一品种的直播田增产184公斤。去年全县27.4万亩稻田全部采用这项技术，平均亩产达到457.5公斤。
    国家科委决定从1990年至1992年在“三北”地区推广旱育稀植技术，推广面积为1400万至1500万亩，约占“三北”地区现有水稻面积的30％至40％。据保守的估算，平均亩产增产50公斤至70公斤，就可实现年增产稻谷7.5亿至10.5亿公斤，创收6亿至8.4亿元。同时，还可节省稻种、用水、用电、用油等项费用3.4亿元。
