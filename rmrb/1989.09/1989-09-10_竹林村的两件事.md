Zhulin is a mountain village in Gongxian County, Henan Province. Recently, a reporter visited Zhulin and was deeply impressed by two incidents regarding their handling of monetary issues.

1. Less Money, More Honor

Zhulin Village places great importance on rewarding excellence. In the past, after each annual evaluation, rewards were distributed. These rewards ranged from a bar of soap or a towel to bed sheets, blankets, watches, electroplated chairs, bicycles, sewing machines, refrigerators, color televisions, and even cash amounts as high as 4,000 yuan. The village would spend tens of thousands to tens of millions of yuan on rewards each year.

As the rewards "upgraded" each year, the village leaders became increasingly worried: if refrigerators and color televisions were rewarded this year, what would be rewarded next year? Apart from the village not being able to afford it, even if they could, the rewards would not have the desired effect. The village party branch raised the issue of rewards for discussion among all villagers, and the conclusion was: less money, more honor, with spiritual encouragement as the main focus. Currently, the per capita annual net income in Zhulin Village is over 1,000 yuan, with most people having built new houses and purchased refrigerators and color televisions. Not only do items like soap and towels lack appeal, but even refrigerators and color televisions are not highly valued. What is most appealing is "face": a sense of honor and self-respect.

The ways to reward "face" are varied. For example, during meetings, models are invited to sit on the stage, and they can bring their spouses to share the honor. Whoever is a model stands at the front, regardless of gender, and is awarded a large red flower by higher-level leaders. For households evaluated as "civilized families," the village party branch secretary and village head personally visit at the end of the lunar year to paste couplets. For those continuously evaluated as "civilized families," a plaque of honor is also hung, with 9 households currently having plaques, bringing glory to their doorsteps. Every year, "good daughters-in-law" are also evaluated, and if someone is selected, the village leaders will drum and set off firecrackers, sending a joyous report to her parents' home.

2. Both Compensation and Emotion

Among the 19 village-run enterprises in Zhulin, over 40 urban technical personnel have been hired, most of whom are "high-priced elders" and "Sunday engineers."

The reporter asked the villagers: "Is it through high salaries that you hire them?" They replied: The average monthly salary for technical personnel is over 300 yuan, and many have rejected offers of 500 yuan from other units to work here. Our idea is that intellectuals value the saying 'a scholar will die for a wise ruler' and 'a scholar will serve a wise ruler,' and few are driven by money. Therefore, we provide both compensation and emotion. With emotion, compensation becomes secondary.

During interviews with some technical personnel, they said: In Zhulin, it feels like being at home. We are mostly in our sixties and seventies, needing respect and warmth, which Zhulin provides. During meetings, we are invited to sit in the front row; during organized tours, we can bring our spouses; our opinions are treated like Zhuge Liang's advice to Liu Bei. During meals, we can order whatever we like, dumplings, wontons, noodles, whatever we want, they prepare it for us. Even at home, we might not get this treatment. When we fall ill, from the village leaders to the villagers, one after another comes to visit, never empty-handed, making us feel that working here is worth it even if we work to death. The village generally does not regulate working hours for these technical personnel, but they often work more than 10 hours a day. An old comrade from the steel foundry would get up at night when the steel was ready, standing by the furnace.

This group of technical personnel has contributed greatly to Zhulin's development. In the first half of this year, the village's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 18.85 million yuan, realizing a profit of 2.44 million yuan. Among these achievements are the hard work of the technical personnel. The significance of a small mountain village using technical personnel lies not only in using their knowledge and learning from them but also in borrowing their reputation. For example, the refractory materials factory, because it hired a well-known domestic expert, gained the trust of large steel plants, which placed large orders for their refractory bricks, a kind of "reputation benefit." For technical personnel, Zhulin people first think of their contributions to Zhulin, and thus, affection naturally arises.

### 竹林村的两件事

　　竹林村的两件事
　　本报记者　李德民
    竹林是河南省巩县的一个山村，最近记者采访竹林，他们对待金钱问题上的两件事，给人留下深刻印象。
    一、少奖“票子”，多奖“面子”
    竹林村很重视奖励先进，原来每年评比后都要发奖品。奖品从一块香皂、一条毛巾，到一条床单、一条毛毯，又到手表、电镀椅、自行车、缝纫机，直到冰箱、彩电，还有高达4000元的现款，全村一次奖励要花几万、十几万元。
    奖品逐年“升级”，村里的领导逐年发愁：今年奖了冰箱、彩电，明年该奖小轿车了，别说村里奖不起，就是奖得起也不能奖，而且，奖励的效果并没有随着奖品的“升级”而“升级”。村党总支把奖励问题提交全体村民讨论，得出的结论是：少奖“票子”，多奖“面子”，以精神鼓励为主。竹林村现在人均年纯收入达1000多元，大多数人盖了新房，买了冰箱、彩电，别说一块香皂、一条毛巾没有多大吸引力，就是冰箱、彩电也不很放在眼里，最有吸引力的还是“面子”：荣誉感、自尊心。
    奖“面子”的方式是多样的。比如，开大会时请模范上主席台，还可以带着妻子或丈夫分享荣誉，谁是模范谁站上首，不分男女，由上级领导给戴大红花。对评上“文明之家”的农户，一到农历腊月底，村党总支书记和村长亲自登门贴对联，给其中连续被评上“文明之家”的农户，还挂光荣匾，现在村里有9户挂了匾，门楣生辉。年年还评“好媳妇”，谁被评上了，村领导就敲锣打鼓，燃放鞭炮，往她娘家送喜报。
                二、既给报酬，更给感情
    在竹林村19个村办企业里，聘请了40多位大城市的科技人员，大部分是些“高价老头”和“星期日工程师”。
    记者问竹林的同志：“是靠高薪聘请吗？”他们说：科技人员的平均月薪300多元，许多人是谢绝了外单位500元的高薪来工作的。我们的想法是，知识分子看重“士为知己者死”、“士为知己者用”，没有几个人是为钱干的，所以，我们既给报酬，更给感情。有了感情，就不计较报酬了。
    采访一些科技人员时，他们说：在竹林就像在家里一样，我们大多是六七十岁的老人了，需要尊重，需要温暖，竹林给了我们这些。开大会时，请到前排就座；组织参观游览时，可以带老伴；对我们的意见，就像刘玄德对诸葛亮。平时吃饭，任我们点，饺子、馄饨、面条，想吃什么人家给做什么，在家里也未必能够这样。生了病，从村领导到村民，一个接一个地来探望，从来不空手，叫人感到，在这里工作，累死也值得。对这些科技人员，村里一般没有规定上下班时间，但他们每天常常干10小时以上，铸钢厂有位老同志，一到深夜钢水出炉时间，他就披衣而起，守在炉旁。
    这批科技人员为竹林的发展出了大力。今年上半年全村工农业总产值达1885万元，实现利润244万元，这里面就有科技人员的辛劳。一个小小山村使用科技人员的意义，除了使用他们的知识，学习他们的知识，还借用了他们的名声。比如，耐火材料厂因为聘请有国内知名的专家，赢得了大钢铁厂的信任，大量订购他们的耐火砖，这是一种“名气效益”。对科技人员，竹林人首先想到的不是人家一月拿300多元，而是人家给竹林作出的贡献，这样，感情便油然而生。
