The defense science and technology industry has made significant strides forward. The director of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, General Ding Henggao, recently discussed the development of China's defense science and technology industry, stating that after 40 years of arduous efforts, China has established a comprehensive system of defense research, testing, and production. A highly conscious and technically proficient defense science and technology workforce has been cultivated, achieving remarkable scientific and technological achievements that have garnered global attention.

Over the past 40 years, the defense science and technology industry has successfully mastered key technologies such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, artificial satellites, and nuclear submarines. This has made China one of the five countries in the world capable of independently developing nuclear and space technologies. To date, China has successfully launched 25 different types of artificial satellites, accurately retrieving 11 recoverable satellites with a 100% retrieval rate. Additionally, several nuclear tests have been conducted, establishing a limited nuclear deterrent force and enhancing China's international standing, contributing to the maintenance of world peace.

The defense science and technology industry has implemented the policy of reform and opening up, actively engaging in international technological exchanges and cooperation. While completing domestic experimental tasks, satellite launch services have been developed, and plans are in place to launch satellites for foreign countries. This marks China's entry into the international space market and its advancement to the forefront of global technology. For instance, the Xichang Satellite Launch Center has hosted over 10 delegations from more than 20 countries and regions, totaling over 300 people, who have come to inspect and discuss cooperation with China's aerospace technology.

Through 40 years of practice, the defense science and technology system has cultivated a highly skilled and dedicated workforce. This team, driven by a strong sense of national defense and selfless dedication, is striving to reach new heights in defense science and technology through innovative labor.

    国防科技工业向高层迈进
    本报讯　国防科工委主任丁衡高中将日前谈到我国国防科技工业的发展状况时说：经过40年的艰苦奋斗，我国已建立起专业门类比较齐全的国防科研、试验和生产体系，培养和造就了一支具有高度思想觉悟、较高科学技术水平的国防科技队伍，取得了举世瞩目的科技成果。
    40年来，国防科技工业在突破尖端技术方面，成功地掌握了原子弹、氢弹、洲际导弹、人造卫星和核潜艇技术，使我国成为世界上5个独立掌握核技术和空间技术的国家之一。到目前为止，我国已成功地发射不同类型的人造卫星25颗，准确地回收了其中11颗返回式卫星，回收率达100％。同时，还完成了几十次核爆炸试验，初步建立起有限的核反击力量，提高了我国的国际威望，为维护世界和平作出了贡献。
    国防科技工业贯彻改革开放的方针，积极开展国际技术交流与合作。在完成国内试验任务的同时，开展了卫星搭载业务，并将为外国发射卫星。这标志着我国航天技术开始进入国际市场，跨入世界先进行列。仅以西昌卫星发射中心为例，已有10多个国家和地区的20多个代表团共300多人前来考察、参观，洽谈与我国航天技术的合作事宜。
    经过40年的实践，国防科技工业系统培养造就了一支具有较高水平和优良作风的国防科技队伍。这支科技队伍，正以强烈的国防观念和无私奉献的精神，为攀登国防科技高峰，进行着创造性劳动。
