The creator of high-efficiency artificial ecosystems - Liang Yu

Liang Yu, the deputy chief of animal husbandry in Hangjin Houqi, Bayannur League, and a labor model in the autonomous region, has dedicated himself to the study of ecological agriculture for many years. He has explored a path to establish a high-efficiency artificial ecosystem for the rural areas of the Hetao region, achieving significant economic benefits.

In 1984, at the age of 69, Deputy Chief of Animal Husbandry Liang Yu, in order to address the increasingly severe problem of secondary salinization of land in the Hetao irrigation area, the continuous decline in soil organic matter content, and the ecological imbalance, collaborated with six farmers from Chun Guang II Commune in Guangrong Township, Hangjin Houqi. They conducted a scientific experiment on "grain and grass rotation, agricultural and pastoral integration," achieving exciting results: the soil salinity in the experimental area decreased by 0.06%, and the soil organic matter increased by 0.72%. The average grain yield per mu exceeded 500 kilograms, and the per capita income exceeded 1,000 yuan. Now, Liang Yu's experimental results have been widely promoted in the Bayannur League and throughout the region.

　　高效人工生态系统的创研者——梁玉
    巴彦淖尔盟杭锦后旗副总畜牧师、自治区劳模梁玉，多年潜心生态农业研究。为河套农村探索出一条建立高效人工生态系统，取得了巨大的经济效益。
    1984年，69岁高龄的副总畜牧师梁玉，为解决河套灌区土地次生盐渍化渐趋严重、土壤有机质含量不断下降、生态失衡的现状，与杭锦后旗光荣乡春光二社的六户农民合作，进行了“粮草轮作、农牧结合”科学试验，取得了令人振奋的结果：试验区土壤含盐量下降了0.06％，土壤有机质增加了0.72％。粮食平均亩产超过500公斤，人均收入超千元。现在，梁玉的试验成果已在巴盟及全区广泛推广。
