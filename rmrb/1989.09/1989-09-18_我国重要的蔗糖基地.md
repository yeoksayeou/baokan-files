    Guangxi's sugarcane production has developed steadily over the years. Currently, Guangxi's annual sugar production accounts for 23.5% of the national total, making it one of the country's major sugar-producing regions.

    Located in the low-latitude southern region, Guangxi enjoys abundant sunlight, ample rainfall, and a long frost-free period, providing ideal conditions for sugarcane cultivation. Historical records show that as early as the end of the Han Dynasty, Guangxi had records of sugarcane cultivation and sugar production. However, until the founding of the People's Republic of China, Guangxi's sugar industry remained in a very backward state. In 1950, Guangxi could only produce a small amount of traditional pressed sugar. Under the guidance of the Party's policies, the broad masses of sugarcane farmers, adhering to the principle of "focusing on local conditions, making rational adjustments, leveraging strengths, and avoiding weaknesses," have optimized the rural industrial structure, continuously increased investment in sugarcane, and promoted the application of scientific sugarcane cultivation techniques. As a result, the area of sugarcane cultivation in the region has expanded from 22.5 million mu during the 1950/1951 crushing season to 41.831 million mu during the 1988/1989 crushing season. The average yield per mu has increased from over 1 ton to more than 3 tons.

    The development of sugarcane production and mechanized sugar factories has promoted each other, fostering mutual growth. Currently, the number of sugar factories in the region has increased from 1 before liberation to 93, with daily crushing capacity increasing from 30 tons to over 100,000 tons.

    The sugar industry has become a major advantage for Guangxi's economy. During the 1988/1989 crushing season, Guangxi's sugar industry achieved a total output value of 1.231 billion yuan, tax revenue of 289 million yuan, and profits of 202 million yuan, all reaching historical highs. The development of sugar has also driven the growth of machinery, coal, transportation, as well as alcohol, paperboard, canned goods, confectionery, beverages, dairy products, pharmaceuticals, and food industries.

　　我国重要的蔗糖基地
    广西蔗糖生产逐年发展。目前，广西年产糖量占全国同期产糖量的23.5％，成为我国重要的产糖区之一。
    广西地处南疆低纬地带，光热充足，雨量充沛，无霜期长，有发展蔗糖得天独厚的条件。据史料记载，早在汉朝末期，广西就有了种蔗制糖的记载。可是，直到中华人民共和国成立前，广西制糖业仍处于十分落后的状态。1950年，广西只能生产少量的土榨糖。在党的政策的指导下，广大蔗农本着“立足区情，因地制宜，扬长避短，发挥优势”的原则，合理调整和优化农村产业结构，不断增加糖蔗投入，推广应用科学种蔗技术，全区糖蔗种植面积由1950／1951年榨季的22.5万亩扩大到1988／1989年榨季的418.31万亩，亩产平均由原来的1吨多提高到现在的3吨多。
    糖蔗生产和机制糖厂建设互相促进，共同发展。现在，全区糖厂已由解放前的1家增加到93家，日榨能力由30吨增加到10万多吨。
    蔗糖业成了广西经济的一大优势。1988／1989年榨季，广西制糖业总产值达12.31亿元，实现税金2.89亿元，利润2.02亿元，均创历史最高水平。蔗糖的发展，还带动了机械、煤炭、交通运输以及酒精、纸板、罐头、糖果、饮料、乳制品、医药和食品工业的发展。
