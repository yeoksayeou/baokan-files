The Lhasa Intermediate People's Court today morning publicly sentenced six criminals involved in the "3·5" riots in Lhasa and espionage activities.

Criminals Dawa and Langga, who were monks at the Quzhuo County Hotuo Temple before their arrest, hung the "Tibet Independence Flag" inside the temple during the "3·5" riots in Lhasa this year. They also went to Lhasa to participate in the riots and shouted reactionary slogans advocating "Tibet Independence."

The Lhasa Intermediate People's Court sentenced criminals Dawa and Langga to four years and three years of imprisonment respectively, and deprived them of their political rights for one year each, for the crime of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.

Another counter-revolutionary propagandist, 57-year-old Ciren Ouqu, incited young people to sing reactionary songs advocating "Tibet Independence" before and after the "3·5" riots, and instigated them to participate in the riots. Due to the severity of his crimes and his refusal to confess after his arrest, he was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for four years.

The monk Danzenpingcuo from Sera Monastery used his two trips abroad to visit relatives to receive special tasks from the Dalai Lama group's security department to collect intelligence on China. He also colluded with monk Awangjianba from Drepung Monastery to pass the collected intelligence about the Lhasa riots through foreigners to the Dalai Lama group's security department. Due to his good attitude in confessing after his arrest and his meritorious service, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for one year. Another spy, Ouqu, also used his trip abroad to visit relatives to be dispatched by the Dalai Lama group's security department to collect intelligence and write reports to the spy agency. He was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for four years.

The Lhasa Intermediate People's Court also sentenced Basang, who flagrantly looted property, beat people, and had no regard for the law, to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life. Basang, 22 years old and a resident of Lhasa, actively participated in the Lhasa riots from March 5 to 6, 1989, and engaged in extensive beating, smashing, looting, and burning, with extremely serious criminal acts.

This morning, the Chengguan District People's Court of Lhasa also publicly sentenced three criminals, Dawa, Dingling, and Gesang, who were guilty of robbery, destruction of public and private property, and disruption of social order. They were sentenced to eight years, five years, and four years of imprisonment respectively.
