I never imagined, dear Comrade Rong Guanxiu, that you would pass away with a smile on August 12th.

You lived to the age of 92, which, according to our hometown's traditions, is considered a joyous passing. Yet, when the news of your departure from the Shijiazhuang Peace Hospital reached our Taihang Mountains, both officials and villagers felt a heavy burden. Even the little children who had just begun to understand the world said sadly, "Our dear Auntie Rong Guanxiu has left us."

Throughout your life, you left behind the kind of footprints a Communist Party member should leave. During the difficult days of the Anti-Japanese War, you led the way in eating coarse grains and saving every bit of rice for the soldiers of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region led by Comrade Nie Rongzhen. You and the women of the village saved every thread and piece of cloth to make shoes for the soldiers. You protected the wounded soldiers, enduring countless hardships, and cared for the severely injured, even going so far as to squeeze out your own milk to feed them. After the soldiers recovered, they gratefully called you "Mother." You humbly smiled and said, "This is my duty." You also emotionally stated, "The soldiers are our benefactors; the Eighth Route Army liberated us!" When you saw soldiers sacrifice themselves, you resolutely sent your own beloved son to the front lines. You were rewarded by the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government, and received high praise from Commander Nie Rongzhen, earning the title of "Mother of the Soldiers."

Honor can drive one forward, but it can also become a burden. After receiving such high honors, your pure heart became even purer, and your humble demeanor became even more humble. At the model meeting, a painter wanted to draw your portrait and write an article about you. You humbly smiled and said, "There's nothing much to draw or write about me." When you returned to your hometown with all your honors, the women congratulated you, and you sincerely told everyone, "My honor is everyone's honor." After national liberation, the county government wanted to send a car to pick you up to attend the National People's Congress in Beijing. You didn't want the state to waste gasoline, so you rode your donkey to the county and took the bus. The county committee's chef made you a bowl of noodles, but you didn't want special treatment. You said, "Eating anything is the same." After you turned eighty, your dutiful daughter-in-law wanted you to rest, but you insisted on feeding the pigs, raising chickens, and cooking, allowing your daughter-in-law to work hard in the fields to contribute surplus grain to the state. You didn't use your honor to gain even a thread of cloth or a piece of string.

As you aged, your memory weakened and your strength waned, which is natural. But your love for the People's Liberation Army remained as strong and clear as ever. On the eve of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the PLA, you and the county Women's Federation made a pair of cloth shoes for Comrade Nie Rongzhen and sent them to him, along with a letter expressing your affection for the soldiers. Nie Rongzhen quickly replied, thanking you for your care and expressing his gratitude for your love for the PLA. After seeing Nie Rongzhen's letter, you were so happy that you couldn't stop smiling. But when I met you at the prefectural guesthouse, I didn't see your smiling face first; instead, I heard your heavy sighs. It turned out that you were displeased with some party cadres who were using their power to seek personal gain and were sowing seeds of distrust in the people's hearts towards the party.

Dear Comrade Rong Guanxiu, you took with you the precious item that Comrade Nie Rongzhen specially sent you, the "Forget-Me-Not" craft flower, and the large basket of peanuts, red dates, and walnuts that Comrade Kang Keqing personally sent you. You left these two treasures, filled with the party's deep affection, to the people of your hometown. Everyone will cherish the blood shed by our beloved soldiers to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital. Everyone will take bold and determined steps on the new journey, marching swiftly towards a brilliant future!

Rest in peace!

    缅怀戎冠秀同志
    杨润身
    尊敬的戎冠秀同志，我万万想不到，您竟然在8月12日含笑而去了。
    你活到92岁高龄，按咱故乡的老俗，已属喜丧，而当您离开大家的消息从石家庄和平医院传进咱太行山间之后，干部和村民们无不感到沉重，连刚懂事的娃娃也悲切地说，不该离开我们的戎冠秀老奶奶离开我们了。
    您在您的生活道路上，留下了一个共产党员应留下的足迹。抗日战争艰难的岁月里，您带头吃糠咽菜，每日为聂荣臻同志率领的晋察冀边区子弟兵节省一把米，又亲自把你和村妇救会员们节余下来的小米送上前线。您又带头节省一条条棉线，一尺尺粗布，组织下盘松村妇女姐妹们做下一双双军鞋，送到亲人子弟兵手中。您掩护子弟兵伤员，经受千难万险，照顾重伤员，不惜将自己的奶汁挤尽，口对口的将奶汁送进重伤员口内。伤员痊愈之后，万分感激地喊你妈妈，您谦和的笑笑说这是您应尽的义务。您又动情地说：子弟兵是俺的恩人，八路军解放俺！您看到战士牺牲，毅然决然地把自己的亲骨肉——最心爱的儿子送上前线。您受到晋察冀军区和晋察冀边区政府的奖励，得到聂荣臻司令员高度称赞，获得子弟兵母亲的光荣称号。
    荣誉可催人奋进，也能变做包袱。获得崇高的荣誉之后，纯厚的您更加纯厚，谦和的您愈发谦和。在英模会上，一位画家要为您画张像，又说要写一篇文章，您谦和的笑笑，说：俺没甚画的，也没甚写的。您满载荣誉回到故乡，妇女姐妹们为您贺喜，您真挚地告诉大家：您的光荣是大家的光荣。全国解放之后，县政府要派小汽车去接您进京参加全国人大会议，您舍不得让国家浪费汽油，骑着您的小毛驴赶到县城乘坐公共汽车。县委会厨师为您做碗面条，您不愿特殊，您说吃甚不是一样。您八旬过后，孝顺的儿媳要您全休，您执意喂猪、养鸡、抱柴做饭，让儿媳尽情地在责任田里滴落汗水，争取为国家奉献余粮。您没有以您的荣誉谋取一尺粗布，一条细线。
    进入老年之后，记忆力渐弱，体力渐萎，是人之必然。而您对解放军的爱，还是那样强烈，那样鲜明。八一建军节六十周年前夕，您同县妇联的同志们一起为聂荣臻同志做双纳底布鞋，给聂荣臻同志寄去，并写一信，把您对解放军健儿们的怀念告诉聂荣臻同志。聂荣臻同志很快复您一信，感谢对他的关怀，感谢您对解放军的厚爱。您见到聂荣臻同志的信之后，兴奋得久笑不止。而我在地委招待所遇见您时，却未先看到您的笑脸，就先听到您的沉重的叹息声。原来您不满有的党员干部在利用人民给予的权力谋私利，在肆意地抛撒使人民对党丧失信心的种子。
    尊敬的戎冠秀同志，您带走了聂荣臻同志特意送您的珍物——“勿忘我”的工艺花，您带走了康克清同志亲自送您的，盛满花生、红枣、核桃的大花篮。您又将凝结着党的深情厚意的“勿忘我”和大花篮两件珍品留给了故乡的人民。大家会珍惜我们的亲人子弟兵为平定首都反革命暴乱付出的鲜血，大家会在新的征途上迈开勇敢而又坚定的步伐，向着光辉的未来迅猛前进！
    您安详地长眠吧！
