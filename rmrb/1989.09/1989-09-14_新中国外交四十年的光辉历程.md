The People's Republic of China has been established for forty years. Upon its founding, China buried the humiliating diplomacy of the old China and pioneered a new type of independent and autonomous diplomacy. Over the past forty years, as international winds shifted and domestic socialist construction developed, after multiple adjustments, especially the significant adjustments made under the personal guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, China's independent and peaceful foreign policy has become more robust and complete, gradually forming a complete diplomatic line and a unique diplomatic style. It has achieved brilliant results in defending China's independence and sovereignty, opposing hegemony, and promoting world peace, making due contributions to developing international friendship and cooperation and promoting human progress.

**Adhering to an Independent and Autonomous Foreign Policy is the Most Fundamental Experience of China's Diplomacy**

Looking back at the forty-year journey of China's diplomatic practice, the most fundamental experience is to safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity and adhere to an independent and autonomous foreign policy.

China suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for over a hundred years, deeply experiencing the pain of losing rights and suffering humiliation. After the Chinese people gained liberation, they took safeguarding the hard-won independent and autonomous rights as the basic stance of China's foreign policy. In diplomacy, China adopted Chairman Mao's policy of "starting anew" and "cleaning the house before inviting guests," not recognizing any diplomatic relations established by the old China with any country, abolishing all unequal treaties, canceling imperialist privileges in China, eliminating the remaining influence and forces of imperialism in China, and establishing new diplomatic relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit.

Not long after the founding of New China, the United States armed invasion of Korea and, disregarding China's repeated warnings, crossed the "38th parallel" and approached the Yalu River. At the same time, it intensified its interference in the anti-French war of the Vietnamese people and dispatched armed forces to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region. The United States threatened China militarily from Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina and politically isolated and contained China, economically blockaded and embargoed China, attempting to strangle New China in its cradle. The Chinese government and people were fearless of violence, kept their word, and, despite the fact that the country had just been founded and everything was in disarray, resolutely dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers across the Yalu River to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army, driving the U.S. forces back to the vicinity of the "38th parallel" and signing the armistice agreement in July 1953. At the same time, China provided significant manpower and material assistance to the Vietnamese people and, in July 1954, at the Geneva Conference, together with other countries, overcame U.S. obstruction and signed the agreement to restore peace in Indochina. On the Taiwan issue, China insisted on principles and struggled, forcing the United States to finally sit down and hold ambassador-level talks with China.

Upon the proclamation of the founding of New China, diplomatic relations were immediately established with the Soviet Union, followed by the signing of a Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Even at that time, Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai had clearly pointed out that one should not rely on the Soviet Union and should not blindly follow or copy the Soviet Union's experience. China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and inviolable sovereignty, resolutely rejecting the Soviet Union's demands that would harm China's sovereignty, and criticizing the Soviet Union's big-power chauvinism in its relations with other socialist countries, where it did not treat others as equals and did not respect the sovereignty of other countries. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the then-Soviet leaders repeatedly pressured China, from tearing up contracts, withdrawing experts, and demanding debt repayment to deploying troops on the border and provoking conflicts. For more than twenty years afterward, the Soviet Union never gave up its military threats against China.

China was not intimidated by this situation. We took a firm and clear stance on the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty and national dignity, resolutely withstanding external pressures. Through long-term diplomatic struggles, China developed into an important force independent of the United States and the Soviet Union. With the changes in the international situation and the strengthening of China's international status and influence, the People's Republic of China resumed its seat in the United Nations, and Sino-U.S. relations shifted from hostility to dialogue and then, through negotiations, established diplomatic relations. Sino-Soviet relations, after a long period of confrontation, finally achieved normalization. These are all major victories achieved by China's adherence to an independent and autonomous peaceful foreign policy.

**Safeguarding World Peace is the Fundamental Goal of China's Diplomacy**

New China pursues a peaceful foreign policy, taking the safeguarding of world peace and the creation of a lasting peaceful environment for the socialist construction of the country as the fundamental goal of China's diplomacy. China firmly opposes all forms of arms races and advocates the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons, and space weapons, as well as the substantial reduction of conventional weapons and military personnel. China believes that the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess the world's largest nuclear and conventional arsenals, have a special responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in stopping the testing, production, and deployment of all types of nuclear weapons, substantially reducing their nuclear arsenals, and taking the lead in substantially reducing their conventional weapons. China's proposals are increasingly accepted by the international community. Since 1986, China has submitted two resolutions on nuclear and conventional disarmament at each session of the United Nations General Assembly, both of which have been unanimously adopted by all countries.

China not only advocates this but also takes the lead in reducing its own military build-up. Since China acquired nuclear weapons on October 16, 1964, it has unilaterally declared that China's development of limited nuclear weapons is for self-defense and that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances, and has promised not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones. China does not advocate, encourage, or engage in nuclear proliferation but only cooperates with other countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The Chinese government has always respected and supported the efforts of relevant countries and regions to establish "nuclear-free zones" and "peace zones." In terms of conventional weapons, China has gradually reduced the proportion of military spending, from 17.5% of the national budget in 1979 to 8% in 1988. In 1985, China decided to reduce the number of military personnel by 1 million, cutting about a quarter of the military. At the same time, large-scale military production was converted to civilian production, and a large number of military airports, roads, ports, and other facilities were converted to civilian or military-civilian use. China's actual actions of reducing military forces have promoted the process of world peace.

To safeguard world peace, China firmly opposes any country occupying the territory of another country under any pretext, interfering in the internal affairs of another country, and engaging in aggressive expansion. China has always demanded that superpowers stop their aggression and expansion against other countries, end their military occupation and interference in other countries, and withdraw their troops stationed in other countries. China has always advocated the political resolution of regional conflicts on a fair and reasonable basis; inter-state disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiations by the countries concerned; internal disputes within a country should be resolved by the people of that country themselves.

After World War II, the struggle for national liberation and the realization of national independence in Asia, Africa, and Latin America surged. New China has firmly stood on their side, providing political, moral, and economic support. A large number of former colonies and dependent countries have become independent sovereign states, greatly changing the color of the world political map. More than a hundred Third World countries, accounting for three-quarters of the world's population, have emerged as an important peace force that cannot be ignored on the international stage. This is a major change of epochal significance after the war, marking that the growth of peace forces has exceeded the growth of war forces. Hegemony politics are increasingly ineffective, and the expansionist policies of hegemony are encountering obstacles everywhere, making it possible to seek a relatively long period of world peace.

China is a developing socialist country. In the struggle for national independence and the safeguarding of national interests, China has received widespread sympathy and support from the Third World countries and peoples. China has always regarded supporting the just struggles of Third World countries as its international duty and has regarded strengthening solidarity and cooperation with Third World countries as the basic starting point of its foreign policy.

**Adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and Opposing Any Country's Interference in the Internal Affairs of Others**

There are so many countries in the world, with different social systems, varying sizes and strengths, diverse ideological values, and even more varied historical traditions and cultural backgrounds. How should we handle relations between countries? As early as December 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai, when receiving the Indian delegation that came to China to discuss the "Agreement on Trade and Communications between the Tibet Region of China and India," first proposed the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence as guidelines for Sino-Indian relations. In June 1954, Premier Zhou visited India and Burma and, together with the prime ministers of the two countries, jointly advocated the five principles of peaceful coexistence as guidelines for "general international relations." The five principles of peaceful coexistence were initially proposed as guidelines for handling relations between countries with different social systems. In 1956, in response to some situations that had emerged, the Chinese government publicly issued a statement pointing out that the mutual relations between socialist countries should even more be established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. In 1982, these principles were clearly incorporated into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Today, China has established diplomatic relations with 139 countries on five continents and is conducting economic, trade, scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges with even more countries and regions.

The basic starting point of China's advocacy and adherence to the five principles of peaceful coexistence is that large and small countries, strong and weak countries, rich and poor countries should all be equally treated, mutually respected, friendly and cooperative, and live in harmony. The path each country takes and the social system it chooses should be decided by the people of each country, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. The five principles of peaceful coexistence are interdependent, interrelated, and interdependent, and none can be missing. The "blocs," "groups," "families," and the like that have emerged after the war have proven and will continue to prove to be unreliable. The five principles of peaceful coexistence have withstood the test of more than thirty years of international vicissitudes and have been endorsed by all countries and peoples who love peace and seek to establish new types of state and international relations, fully demonstrating their strong vitality.

In relations between countries, China firmly opposes any country interfering in the internal affairs of another country under any pretext and infringing upon the sovereignty of another country.

Unfortunately, in today's world, such phenomena of wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries are still common. Some Western countries regard their values as absolute truths. As long as they do not like something, they will interfere, exert political pressure, and impose economic sanctions. They talk about "freedom," "equality," and "democracy," but in state relations, they openly practice hegemony. The Chinese people who have stood up will certainly not be afraid of ghosts or superstitions and will not yield to any external pressure. We take such an attitude not only to safeguard the dignity of the motherland but also to safeguard the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the norms of international relations.

**Expanding Economic Cooperation with the Outside World and Promoting Common Development**

Implementing an open policy, expanding economic cooperation with the outside world, and promoting common development are important tasks of China's diplomacy. Opening up to the outside world does not mean abandoning self-reliance; on the contrary, only on the basis of self-reliance can we better open up to the outside world. At the beginning of the founding of the country, the "Common Program" clearly stipulated: "The People's Republic of China can, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, restore and develop trade relations with the governments and peoples of various countries." Zhou Enlai also specifically elaborated: Self-reliance is not closed-doorism. Developing the economy relies on one's own strength on the one hand and also relies on international cooperation on the other. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we exchange what we have and lack, seek human prosperity, and achieve common development.

In the 1950s and 1960s, China's economic cooperation with foreign countries was very limited, mainly due to the embargo and blockade imposed by Western developed countries on China, and there were only some private trade exchanges. During the "Cultural Revolution," China's foreign economic and trade exchanges were greatly disrupted. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to shift the focus of the party's work to economic construction and to implement the strategic decision of activating the economy domestically and opening up to the outside world, China's foreign economic cooperation and trade exchanges have developed comprehensively.

China implements comprehensive opening up, opening up to both capitalist countries and socialist countries; opening up to both developed countries and developing countries. China's economic cooperation with developed countries has made significant progress in introducing technology and equipment, absorbing foreign capital, expanding foreign trade, and conducting exchanges in science, education, culture, and sports. China's economic and technological cooperation with developing countries has also opened up broad new avenues, continuing to provide assistance to some countries while carrying out various forms of mutual benefit cooperation such as joint ventures, cooperative operations, contract engineering, technical services, cooperative management, and compensatory trade, playing a role in complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, exchanging what we have and lack, and promoting development, and providing valuable experience for South-South cooperation and regional cooperation.

At present, China has developed economic, trade, scientific, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with more than 180 countries and regions and has participated in a wide range of multilateral and bilateral economic activities of the United Nations and other international organizations.

China's open policy to the outside world is not a temporary measure but a long-term policy formulated based on the need for socialist modernization construction. It should be pointed out that expanding international economic cooperation is mutually beneficial, not only beneficial to China but also beneficial to the cooperating partners. If this economic exchange is disrupted, China will certainly suffer some losses, and the economy of the country that takes sanctions will also be harmed. More importantly, developing international economic ties and exchanges is conducive to maintaining world peace. China's open policy to the outside world will not change and will advance at an even faster pace. With the rapid development of science and technology in the world, China advocates that countries and regions around the world open up to each other and complement each other, which is beneficial to the common development of mankind.

**China's Diplomacy Should Contribute to the Great Cause of National Reunification**

In December 1984, the Chinese and British governments jointly signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong. In April 1987, China also jointly signed the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau with the Portuguese government. Based on the concept of "one country, two systems," China fully considered the history and current situation of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the differences between the two, and determined that after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau in 1997 and 1999, respectively, the capitalist social system in the two regions will remain unchanged, continuing to maintain long-term prosperity, stability, and development. At the same time, the economic interests of Britain, Portugal, and other countries in Hong Kong and Macau will be taken care of. These policies are completely realistic and reasonable, in line with the fundamental interests of the people of Hong Kong and Macau, including the people of the entire country, and also take into account the legitimate interests of all relevant parties.

The signing of the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations has taken a big step towards the realization of China's reunification and opened up a broad prospect for future cooperation between China and Britain and China and Portugal. It is also of great significance for maintaining peace in Asia and the world. These two joint declarations also provide fresh experience for the peaceful resolution of historical legacy issues between countries and have received widespread praise from international public opinion.

To promote the peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the mainland and to eliminate external interference and obstruction, China has consistently adhered to its stance in diplomacy and has resolutely fought against all attempts by international forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, advocate "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan." Both sides of the Taiwan Strait speak of only one China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. People share the same heart, and hearts share the same mind. "One country, two systems" is the most realistic and feasible plan for the peaceful reunification of China. The recent intensification of the so-called "flexible diplomacy" by the authorities in Taiwan is to use economic and trade relations to propose political conditions, actually using external forces to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," which we firmly oppose.

Looking back at the forty-year diplomatic vicissitudes of New China and looking ahead to the current international situation, which is favorable for peace and development but also tortuous and complex, we firmly believe that as long as we continue to adhere to the implementation of an independent and autonomous peaceful foreign policy and adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, our great socialist motherland will play an increasingly important role in international affairs and make greater contributions to opposing hegemony and maintaining world peace.

    新中国外交四十年的光辉历程
　　钱其琛
    中华人民共和国建立已经四十个春秋了。新中国一建立，就彻底埋葬了旧中国的屈辱外交，开创了独立自主的新型外交。四十年来，随着国际风云的变幻和国内社会主义建设的发展，经过多次调整，特别是80年代以来，在邓小平同志的亲自主持下进行的重大调整，我国独立自主的和平外交政策更加充实和完善了，逐步形成了一条完整的外交路线和独特的外交风格。它在捍卫我国独立主权，反对霸权主义，维护世界和平的事业中取得了辉煌的成就，为发展国际友好合作和促进人类进步作出了应有的贡献。
    坚持独立自主的对外政策是新中国外交最根本经验
    回顾新中国外交实践四十年的历程，维护国家主权和民族尊严，坚持独立自主的对外政策是最根本的经验。
    中国遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫长达一百多年，深受丧权辱国之苦。中国人民获得解放以后，就把维护来之不易的独立自主权利作为我国外交政策的基本立场。新中国在外交上采取毛主席提出的“另起炉灶”、“打扫干净屋子再请客”的方针，不承认旧中国同任何外国建立的外交关系，废除一切不平等条约，取消帝国主义在华的特权，肃清帝国主义在华的残余势力和影响，在互相尊重领土主权完整和平等互利的基础上同世界各国建立新的外交关系。
    在新中国诞生不久，美国武装入侵朝鲜，并不顾我国多次警告，越过“三八线”，进逼鸭绿江；同时，它还加紧干涉印度支那人民的抗法战争，并派遣武装部队侵占我国领土台湾和台湾海峡地区。美国从朝鲜、台湾、印度支那三个方面对我国进行军事威胁，并在政治上实行孤立、遏制，经济上进行封锁、禁运，企图把新中国扼杀于摇篮之中。中国政府和人民不畏强暴，说话算数，不顾建国伊始、百废待兴，毅然派遣中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，把美军打回到“三八线”附近，于1953年7月签订停战协定。同时，我国对越南人民给予人力和物力上的巨大援助，并于1954年7月在日内瓦会议上同其他国家共同努力，克服美国的阻挠，签订了恢复印度支那和平协议。在台湾问题上，我国坚持原则，坚持斗争，迫使美国终于不得不坐下来同我国举行大使级的会谈。
    新中国宣告成立，立即同苏联建立了邦交，随后签订了友好同盟互助条约。即使在那个时候，毛泽东主席和周恩来总理都曾明确指出，对苏联不能有依赖之心，对苏联的经验不能盲从、照搬。我国始终坚持内政不容干涉、主权不可侵犯的原则，断然拒绝苏联提出的有损我国主权的要求，批评了苏联在对待其他社会主义国家的关系中那种不以平等待人、不尊重别国主权的大国主义表现。到50年代末、60年代初，当时的苏联领导人向我国一再施加压力，由撕毁合同、撤走专家、逼还债务，发展到陈兵边境，挑起冲突。之后在长达二十多年的时间里，苏联始终没有放弃对中国进行军事威胁。
    中国没有被这种情况吓倒。我们在事关维护国家主权和民族尊严的原则问题上立场坚定，态度鲜明，坚决顶住了外来压力。中国在长期的外交斗争中发展成为独立于美苏之外的一支重要力量。随着国际形势的变化和我国国际地位与影响的加强，中华人民共和国恢复了在联合国的席位，中美关系由敌对转向对话，进而经过谈判建立了外交关系。中苏关系经过长时间的对抗，最终实现了两国关系的正常化。这都是我国坚持独立自主的和平外交政策所取得的重大胜利。
      维护世界和平是我国外交的根本目标
    新中国推行的是和平的外交政策，把维护世界和平并为国家的社会主义建设争取一个持久的和平环境作为我国外交的根本目标。我国坚决反对一切军备竞赛，提出了全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器、化学武器、生物武器和太空武器，以及大规模裁减常规武器和军事人员的主张。我国认为，拥有世界上最庞大核武库和常规武库的美、苏两国对裁军负有特殊责任，应率先停止试验、生产和部署一切类型的核武器，大幅度削减它们的核武库，并率先大规模地裁减它们的常规武器。中国的这些主张越来越多地为国际社会所接受。自1986年以来，中国在历届联合国大会上都提出关于核裁军和常规裁军的两个决议案，并获得各国一致通过。
    中国不仅这样主张而且以实际行动率先裁减了自己的军备。我国自从1964年10月拥有核武器的那一天起，就单方面宣布：中国发展有限的核武器是自卫的，任何时候，任何情况下决不首先使用核武器，还承诺不对无核国家和无核区使用或威胁使用核武器。中国不主张、不鼓励、也不从事核扩散，只在和平利用核能方面同其他国家合作。中国政府一贯尊重和支持有关国家和地区建立“无核区”、“和平区”的努力。在常规军备上，我国率先逐年降低了军费的比例，军费从1979年占国家预算的17.5％，降低到1988年的8％。1985年我国决定减少军队员额100万，裁去军队大约四分之一。同时大规模地把军工生产转为民用生产，把大批军用机场、道路、港口等设施转为民用或军民合用。我国裁军的实际行动推进了世界和平的进程。
    为了维护世界和平，我国坚决反对任何国家以任何借口侵占别国领土，干涉别国内政，进行侵略扩张。我国一贯要求超级大国停止对别国的侵略和扩张，结束对别国的军事占领和干涉，撤走驻在别国的军队。我国一向主张在公正合理的基础上政治解决地区冲突，国与国之间的争端应由有关国家通过谈判和平解决；一国内部的争端应由本国人民自己解决。
    第二次世界大战以后，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲争取民族解放、实现国家独立的斗争风起云涌。新中国坚定不移地站在它们一边，从政治上、道义上、经济上加以支持。一大批从前的殖民地、附属国成为独立的主权国家，极大地改变了世界政治地图的颜色。占世界人口四分之三的一百多个第三世界国家的兴起，成为国际舞台上一支不可忽视的和平力量。这是战后具有划时代意义的重大变化，标志着和平力量的增长超过了战争力量的增长。强权政治越来越行不通，霸权主义的扩张政策到处碰壁，争取一个较长时期的世界和平有了现实的可能性。
    我国是发展中的社会主义国家。我国在争取民族独立和维护国家权益的斗争中得到第三世界国家和人民的广泛同情和支持。我国也一贯把支持第三世界国家的正义斗争作为自己应尽的国际义务，把加强同第三世界国家的团结与合作作为自己对外政策的基本立足点。
    坚持和平共处五项原则反对任何国家干涉别国内政
    世界上有那么多的国家，社会制度不同，大小强弱有别，意识形态价值观念各异，历史传统、文化背景更是千差万别，那么处理国家关系应当遵循什么原则呢？早在1953年12月，周恩来总理在接见印度来华商谈《关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定》的代表团时，首次提出互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，作为指导中印两国关系的准则。1954年6月周总理访问印度、缅甸，又同两国总理共同倡导把和平共处五项原则作为“一般国际关系”的准则。和平共处五项原则最初是作为处理社会制度不同国家之间的关系而提出来的。1956年针对当时出现的一些情况，我国政府公开发表声明，指出社会主义国家的相互关系更应该建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上。1982年这些原则已经被明确地载入中华人民共和国宪法。今天，我国已同五大洲139个国家建立了外交关系，并同更多的国家和地区开展着经济贸易、科技和文化的合作和交流。
    我国倡导和坚持和平共处五项原则的基本出发点是：大国小国、强国弱国、富国贫国，都应一律平等、互相尊重、友好合作、和睦相处。各国走什么样的道路、选择什么样的社会制度，应由各国人民自己决定，任何外国都无权干涉。和平共处五项原则是互为前提、互为条件、相互联系的一个整体，缺一不可。在战后出现的“阵营”、“集团”、“大家庭”等等，历史证明并还将证明是靠不住的。而和平共处五项原则经受了三十多年国际风云变幻的考验，得到了所有爱好和平、要求建立新型国家和国际关系的国家和人民的赞同，充分显示了强大的生命力。
    在国家与国家的关系上，我国坚决反对任何国家以任何借口干涉别国的内政，侵犯别国的主权。
    遗憾的是，在现在的世界上，这种肆意干涉别国内政的现象还是屡见不鲜的。有的西方国家把自己的价值观念看作是绝对真理。只要是他们不喜欢的事，就要横加干涉，施加政治压力，予以经济制裁。他们口口声声讲“自由”、“平等”、“民主”，而在国家关系上却公然奉行霸权主义。已经站起来的中国人民当然不怕鬼，不信邪，不会屈从于任何外来的压力。我们采取这样的态度不仅是维护祖国的尊严，而且也是为了维护和平共处五项原则，维护国际关系的准则。
    扩大对外经济合作  促进各国共同发展
    实行对外开放，扩大对外经济合作，促进各国共同发展，是中国外交的重要任务之一。对外开放并不摒弃自力更生，相反只有在自力更生的基础上才能更好地对外开放。建国之初，在《共同纲领》中就明确规定：“中华人民共和国可在平等和互利的基础上，与各国政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系。”周恩来并曾具体阐明：自力更生不是闭关自守，发展经济一方面依靠自己的力量，另一方面也要靠国际合作。在平等互利的基础上互通有无，求得人类繁荣，共同发展。
    50年代和60年代，中国同外国的经济合作关系很有限，那是由于西方发达国家对中国实行封锁禁运，只能有一些民间的贸易来往。“文化大革命”期间，我国对外经济贸易来往受到极大干扰。中共十一届三中全会决定把党的工作重点转到经济建设上来，作出了对内搞活经济，对外实行开放的战略决策，我国的对外经济合作和贸易来往才得到了全面的发展。
    我国实行全面的对外开放，既对资本主义国家开放，也向社会主义国家开放；既对发达国家开放，也向发展中国家开放。我国同发达国家的经济合作，在引进技术设备、吸收外国资金、扩大对外贸易和开展科学、教育、文化、体育等交流方面，获得了很大进展。我国同发展中国家的经济技术合作也开辟了广泛的新途径，在继续对一些国家提供援助的同时，开展了合资经营、合作经营、承包工程、技术服务、合作管理、补偿贸易等多种形式的互利合作，起到了取长补短、互通有无、促进发展的作用，并为南南合作和区域合作提供了有益的经验。
    目前我国已同世界上180多个国家和地区发展了经济、贸易、科技和文化的交流与合作，并在广泛的范围内和更深的层次上参加了联合国和其他国际组织的多边和双边的经济活动。
    中国实行对外开放政策并不是权宜之计，是从实现社会主义现代化建设的需要出发制定的一项长期政策。需要指出的是，扩大国际经济合作是互利的，不仅对中国有利，对合作伙伴也是有利的。使这种经济交往受到破坏，中国固然会受到一些损失，对采取制裁措施的国家的经济也会造成损害。更重要的是，发展国际间的经济联系和交往有利于维护世界和平。中国对外开放的政策不会改变，而且还会以更快的步伐前进。随着世界科学技术的迅速发展，我国主张，世界各国之间和各个地区之间相互开放，相互补充，以利于人类的共同发展。
    我国外交要为祖国统一大业作出贡献
    1984年12月，中国和英国政府共同签署了中英关于香港问题的联合声明。1987年4月，中国又同葡萄牙政府共同签署了中葡两国关于澳门问题的联合声明。根据“一国两制”的构想，我国充分考虑了香港、澳门的历史和现状，也顾及两者之间的差异，确定中国在1997年和1999年先后在香港、澳门恢复行使主权后，这两个地区的资本主义社会制度不变，继续保持长期繁荣、稳定和发展，同时英国、葡萄牙和其他国家在港、澳的经济利益将得到照顾。这些政策是完全实事求是和合情合理的，符合包括港、澳同胞在内的全国人民的根本利益，并兼顾了各有关方面的正当利益。
    中英、中葡《联合声明》的签署，朝着实现中国的统一迈出了一大步，为中英、中葡今后加强合作开辟了广阔的前景。对维护亚洲和世界和平也具有重大的意义。这两个联合声明还为和平解决国家之间的历史遗留问题提供了新鲜的经验，得到了国际舆论的广泛好评。
    为促进台湾与大陆的和平统一，排除来自外部的干扰和阻挠，我国在外交方面坚持一贯的立场，同国际上一切干涉中国内政、鼓吹“两个中国”或“一中一台”的图谋进行了坚决的斗争。海峡两岸都讲只有一个中国，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。人同此心，心同此理。“一国两制”是实现中国和平统一的最符合实际、最为可行的方案。台湾当局近来加紧推行所谓“弹性外交”，是利用经济、贸易关系，提出政治条件，实际上是借助外力制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”，这是我们坚决反对的。
    回顾新中国四十年的外交风云，展望当今世界有利于和平与发展而又曲折复杂的国际形势，我们坚信，只要一如既往地坚持执行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持改革开放方针，我们伟大的社会主义祖国在国际事务中必将发挥越来越重要的作用，为反对霸权主义，维护世界和平作出更大的贡献。
