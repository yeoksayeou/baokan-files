I love "Eastern Rainbow" because it is beautiful! I searched in the encyclopedia but could not find the right words to express this feeling of beauty. I only feel that my soul is bound to "Eastern Rainbow," drifting and soaring with it...

I do not know when our ancestors began to transcend the basic needs of survival and started to pursue the beauty of clothing. This is the awakening of life consciousness, the first step in conquering nature... "Eastern Rainbow" takes me back along the river of history: a string of leaves, a piece of animal skin, a feather, a shell, "transformed" into the colorful and dazzling costumes before my eyes. The meticulously woven skirts, the finely crafted embroidery, the unique headpieces, and even a silk ribbon, a silver comb, a pair of foot ornaments, all seem like precious documents, recording the long and arduous journey of humanity, embodying the hard work and wisdom of ancient ethnic groups. How rich and profound, how deep and far-reaching. "Eastern Rainbow"! It arouses our pride in the five-thousand-year-old civilization.

The flow of history expands the space before my eyes: snow-capped mountains, vast grasslands, roaring rivers, towering mountains; fiery cotton trees, lush palm groves, golden peacocks, silver cranes, the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, plants, flowers, birds, fish... It seems that all these have left their beautiful shadows in the "rainbow." This is the blessing of nature bestowed upon this land. Generation after generation, people of various ethnic groups have tilled, herded, fished, hunted, played, worshipped, and loved here... A style of dress reflects a way of life, often combining practicality and decoration, permeating the customs, beliefs, interests, and ideas of each ethnic group... "Eastern Rainbow" is a breathtaking scroll—on the vast landscape of our motherland, it paints the social customs of various ethnic groups. Vibrant and colorful, it stirs our love for this warm land that nurtures us.

I follow "Eastern Rainbow" to explore the depths of the art palace. How wonderful, how magnificent. 55 ethnic groups, more than 1300 precious pieces of clothing and accessories, worn by 20 beautiful young men and women, are displayed one by one:

It is poetry. It has the rhythm, spirit, imagination, and ethereal quality of poetry. But it is not poetry, or rather, it is poetry without words.

It is painting. It has the harmonious colors, smooth lines, and clear layers of painting. But it is not painting, or rather, it is a series of moving paintings.

It is dance. It has the posture, grace, and charm of dance. But it is not dance; it only draws moderately from the dance's expression of physical beauty and ethnic style, while maintaining the individuality of the costume show.

It is a beautiful and melodious piece of music, not because it is accompanied by music from beginning to end, but because it has a melodious tune and a singing melody...

"Eastern Rainbow" integrates poetry, painting, dance, and music, a creation of genius artists, a modern interpretation of tradition, and a fusion of the aesthetic consciousness of various ethnic groups.

I love "Eastern Rainbow" because it is beautiful. This is a beauty recognized by all, possessing eternal charm.

    魂系《东方彩霞》
    ——观云南“中国少数民族穿戴艺术表演”
    资华筠
    我爱《东方彩霞》，因为它美！我在辞海中寻找，却选择不出恰当的语汇来表达这美的感受。只觉得魂系《东方彩霞》，飘然随之遨翔……
    不知从何时起，我们的祖先超越了生存本能的需要，懂得了对服饰美的追求，这是生命意识的觉醒，征服自然的起步……《东方彩霞》引我沿着历史的长河朔源而上：一串树叶、一张兽皮、一根羽毛、一粒贝壳，“幻化”成眼前这花团锦簇、光华夺目的服饰。那精心织就的筒裙，作工考究的方绣，式样奇特的头冠以至于一缕丝带、一把银梳、一付足饰都好似一份珍贵的文献，记录着人类漫长而艰难的历程，凝聚着古老民族的辛劳和智慧。多么丰厚隽永，多么源远流长。《东方彩霞》啊！唤起了我们对五千年文明的自豪感。
    历史的流光将眼前的空域拓展开来：皑皑白雪，茫茫草原，滔滔江河，巍巍群山；红火的木棉，葱郁的椰林，金色的孔雀，银色的仙鹤，日月星辰、山川草木、花鸟鱼虫……仿佛都在片片“彩霞”中留下了自己秀美的身影。那是大自然赐予我们这片土地的恩泽，各族人民世世代代在这里耕作、放牧、捕鱼、狩猎、嬉戏、祭拜，谈情说爱……一种穿戴反映了一种生活方式，往往是实用和美饰兼顾，渗透了各个民族的习俗、信仰、情趣、观念……《东方彩霞》是一幅令人叹为观止的画卷——在祖国壮丽河山的“底布”上，挥洒出各族人民的社会风情。生机勃勃、多姿多采，激荡着我们对于养育着自己的这片热土的爱恋。
     我随《东方彩霞》在艺术的殿堂里寻幽觅胜。多么奇妙，多么壮观。55个兄弟民族，1300多件珍贵的服装饰品，由20位俊美的少女少男精巧地穿戴起，一一展现：
    它是诗。有着诗的节律、气韵，诗的想象力和空灵感。但它不是诗，或者说，它是没有语言文字的诗。
    它是画。有着浓淡相宜的色彩、洗练流畅的线条、层次分明的构图。但它不是画，或者说，它是一幅幅流动着的画图。
    它是舞。有着舞的步态，舞的丰姿、舞的意趣。但它不是舞，它只是适度地汲取了舞蹈体现形体美和民族风格方面的特长，却固守着服饰展演的个性。
    它是优美动听的乐曲，并非由于自始至终有音乐陪伴，它本身就有着婉转的音调，如歌的旋律……
      《东方彩霞》融诗、画、舞、乐为一体，是艺术家天才的创造，是现代人对传统的阐释，是各民族审美意识的交融。
    我爱《东方彩霞》，因为它美。这是世人公认的美，具有永恒的魅力。
