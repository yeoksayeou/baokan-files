The summit of non-aligned countries continued its general debate today, with the meeting extending into the night. Many leaders of these countries, while acknowledging a trend towards easing international tensions, expressed concern over global hotspots and regional conflicts. They believe that the non-aligned movement still faces "serious economic, political, and ecological problems" and advocate for promoting South-North dialogue to build bridges towards the future.

Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida pointed out that the easing of tensions between the two superpowers should be accompanied by a process of disarmament. He emphasized that world peace to a large extent depends on the resolution of regional conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, Cambodia, and Central America.

Cuban First Vice President of the Council of Ministers Raúl Castro accused the United States of not abandoning its wars against progressive and independent countries in the Third World in this era of détente. He believes that the "Panama crisis" is essentially about Washington's refusal to fulfill its obligations under the Panama Canal Treaties and its open interference, economic blockade, pressure, and efforts to create instability in Panama.

So far, the speeches at the summit have generally addressed the deteriorating economic situation and debt crisis facing developing countries, and have proposed many constructive suggestions. Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah proposed that creditor countries waive interest on external debts and cancel the debts of the poorest countries. He suggested that the United Nations Secretary-General convene an international conference within six months, involving 10 of the most developed countries, other creditor countries, as well as the International Monetary Fund and debtor countries, to formulate principles and methods for solving the debt crisis.

The leaders of Yugoslavia, India, Venezuela, Cyprus, and other countries and governments suggested that a global dialogue should be initiated between the South and the North, and emphasized the strengthening of South-South cooperation. Venezuelan President Andrés Pérez suggested holding a summit of South-South leaders before a South-North summit to strengthen unity and long-term cooperation among developing countries. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi also proposed the establishment of an "Earth Protection Fund."

Additionally, the leaders of 10 countries, including Yugoslavia, Venezuela, India, and Nigeria, had a "working breakfast" today at the invitation of Peruvian President Alan García. It is reported that they advocated for creating conditions for a summit of developed and developing countries, similar to the Cancún Summit, through South-North consultations.

    不结盟国家领导人继续在首脑会议发言
    主张推动南北对话
    本报贝尔格莱德9月5日电　记者严正报道：不结盟国家首脑会议今天继续进行一般性辩论，大会一直延续到深夜。许多国家的领导人在肯定国际关系出现缓和趋势的同时，对世界性热点和地区性冲突表示关注和担忧。他们认为不结盟运动仍面对着“严重的经济、政治和生态问题”，主张推动南北对话，在南北之间架设通向未来的桥梁。
    尼日利亚总统易卜拉欣·巴达莫西·巴班吉达指出，两个超级大国的缓和应伴有裁军的进程。他强调世界和平在很大程度上取决于非洲、中东、柬埔寨和中美洲等地区性冲突的解决。
    古巴部长会议第一副主席劳尔·卡斯特罗指责美国在缓和的时代不放弃反对第三世界进步独立国家的战争。他认为，“巴拿马危机”的实质是华盛顿不想履行自己在巴拿马条约中承担的义务，而以公开的方式对巴拿马进行干涉、经济封锁、施加压力和制造不稳定等。
    迄今为止的大会发言普遍谈到了发展中国家恶化的经济形势和债务危机，并相应提出了许多积极的建议。科威特国家元首埃米尔贾比尔·艾哈迈德·萨巴赫主张债权国免除外债利息，取消最贫穷国家的债务。建议联合国秘书长在6个月内召开有10个最发达国家、其它债权国以及国际货币基金组织和债务国参加的国际会议，制定解决债务危机的原则和方法。
    南斯拉夫、印度、委内瑞拉、塞浦路斯等国家和政府首脑都建议南北之间进行全球性对话，并强调加强南南合作。委内瑞拉总统安德雷斯·佩雷斯建议在召开南北首脑会议前先召开南南首脑会议，加强发展中国家内部团结与长期的合作。印度总理拉·甘地还提出，建立“保护地球基金”的方案。
    另外，南斯拉夫、委内瑞拉、印度、尼日利亚等10国领导人应秘鲁总统阿兰·加西亚邀请，今天共进“工作性早餐”。据悉，他们主张通过南北磋商，为举行像坎昆会议那样的发达国家和发展中国家首脑会议创造条件。
