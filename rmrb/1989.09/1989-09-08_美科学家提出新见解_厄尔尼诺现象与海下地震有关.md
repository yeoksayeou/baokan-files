    American Scientists Propose New Insight:
    El Niño Phenomenon Related to Submarine Earthquakes

    The July issue of the American magazine "Discovery" reported on the research situation regarding the El Niño phenomenon. The following is an excerpt: "El Niño" refers to the periodic abnormal warming of the sea surface near the coast of Peru, which was previously thought to be purely a local marine disturbance. However, meteorologists have recently discovered that its influence extends globally. The root cause of El Niño may not be in the ocean or the atmosphere, but deep within the Earth's interior. Seismologist Daniel Walker of the University of Hawaii has discovered that since 1964, the occurrence of five El Niño events has closely coincided with earthquakes occurring at the boundaries of two moving tectonic plates. Walker's discovery suggests the possibility that energy released from the Earth's interior may influence the weather on the Earth's surface in some way. According to Walker, earthquakes in the East Pacific Ridge are expected to occur before volcanic activity in the area reaches its peak. If volcanic heat flows to the sea surface in some way, this heat will cause the sea water around Easter Island, Chile, to warm up.

    Herbert Shaw and Jan Moore of the U.S. Geological Survey recently discovered that the young lava flowing on both sides of the East Pacific Ridge is quite extensive: this lava flow is approximately 3.5 cubic miles. Shaw and Moore say that this heat could account for 10% of the sea surface temperature rise observed during El Niño years if all the heat from this lava were to flow to the surface.

    Walker's theory about the relationship between earthquakes and the atmosphere still needs to be verified.

    美科学家提出新见解
    厄尔尼诺现象与海下地震有关
    美国《发现》月刊7月号报道了有关厄尔尼诺现象研究情况，现摘发如下：“厄尔尼诺”是秘鲁近海海面定期的不正常升温现象，过去被认为纯粹是局部的海洋扰动。但是近来，气象学家们发现它的影响波及全球。厄尔尼诺的根源也许不在海洋，不在大气层，而是在地球内部的深处。夏威夷大学的地震学家丹尼尔·沃克已经发现，自从1964年以来，五次厄尔尼诺发生的时间都与在地球的两个移动板块之间的边界上发生地震这一周期现象密切吻合。沃克的发现提出了以下可能性：从地球内部散发的能量可能以某种方式影响地球表面的天气。据沃克说，东太平洋海隆一带的地震，预料将在该区火山活动达到顶峰前发生。如果火山热以某种方式流向海面，这种热将使智利复活节岛周围的海水升温。
    美国地质勘探局的赫伯特·肖和詹·穆尔最近发现，在东太平洋海隆两侧流动的、显然是年轻的熔岩十分宠大：这股熔岩流约有3.5立方英里。肖和穆尔说，这些热可能相当于厄尔尼诺发生年所观察到的海面温升的10％，如果这些熔岩的热都流到海面的话。
    沃克的地震与大气关系的理论还有待证实。
