The author recently conducted interviews in over ten counties in Hebei Province on the issue of corruption prevention. It was observed that various measures for corruption prevention have been implemented, and leading officials are leading by example in maintaining integrity and self-discipline, which has won the hearts of the people. However, it was also discovered that there are instances of differential treatment in corruption prevention work.

This phenomenon of differential treatment in corruption prevention manifests in the following ways:
1. Differential treatment in receiving visitors from higher-level departments;
2. Differential treatment in entertaining visitors from other provinces and counties;
3. Differential treatment in accepting invitations and gifts from local enterprises;
4. Differential treatment in receiving reporters for interviews.

This phenomenon of differential treatment in corruption prevention has induced competitive and observational attitudes among various places in their corruption prevention work, and the public has expressed considerable dissatisfaction.

Regardless of whether the visitors are from higher levels or other provinces, there will always be officials of various ranks accompanying them. Some townships, seeing this, follow suit, making corruption prevention merely a formality.

The phenomenon of differential treatment in corruption prevention also reflects the lack of confidence and some difficulties faced by certain leading officials in corruption prevention. They are concerned that whoever engages in corruption prevention will suffer losses and fear that it will affect local economic development. One county magistrate said, "Four dishes and one soup, projects will be lost; if the 'god of wealth' does not come, it will be difficult to be a county magistrate." One county party secretary said that higher-level and out-of-province officials are difficult to manage and dare not be provoked; being able to manage and control local officials is already quite good.

From this, it can be seen that corruption prevention is a systematic project. The corruption prevention work of party committees and governments at all levels and their affiliated functional departments must proceed in a coordinated manner. Only in this way can corruption prevention be effectively implemented.

    刹刹此类“有别”现象
    于绍良
  笔者最近就廉政建设问题采访了河北省10多个县，看到各地制定了不少廉政建设措施，而且领导干部带头廉洁自律，深得民心。但也发现廉政工作中存在有别现象。
    所谓廉政有别，一是对上级有关部门来人接待有别；
    二是对外地、县来人吃喝有别；
    三是对县内企业请客送礼有别；
    四是对记者来县采访接待有别。
    这种廉政有别现象，诱发了各地在廉政建设中的攀比观望思想，群众对此颇有怨言。
    因不论上级、外地来客，总得有大大小小的干部陪客。一些乡镇见状也随之效法，使廉政建设流于形式。
    廉政有别现象，也反映出一些领导干部对廉政建设信心不足和他们的一些苦衷。他们担心的是，谁搞廉政谁吃亏，怕影响当地经济发展。一位县长说：“四菜一汤，项目跑光；‘财神’不来，县长难当。”一位县委书记说，上级和外地来的干部我们不好管，也不敢惹，能管住、管好本县的干部就不错了。
    由此看来，廉政建设也是一项系统工程，各级党委、政府及所属职能部门的廉政建设必须同步进行。这样，廉政建设才能落到实处。
