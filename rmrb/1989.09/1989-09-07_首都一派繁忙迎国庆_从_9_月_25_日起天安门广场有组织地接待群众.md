The capital is bustling with activity in preparation for National Day. The festive atmosphere is growing stronger each day, and the preparations for various National Day celebrations are basically in place and are being finalized.

The majestic Tiananmen Gate is undergoing partial repainting and interior decoration and arrangement. The viewing platforms on both sides are also being renovated and painted.

In the center of Tiananmen Square, gardeners are busy arranging a large sloping flower bed. It is reported that the northern slope of the flower bed will feature a radiant sun made of red flowers, with eleven large sunflowers, each with a diameter of three meters, symbolizing the 110 million people of all ethnic groups in the country with hearts turned towards the Party. The southern slope will feature a giant fluttering five-star red flag, with the years 1949-1989 prominently displayed on either side, signifying the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

On the northern part of the square, a statue of workers, peasants, and intellectuals will be erected. On either side of the statue, there will be two large flower baskets, each over six meters high, made of five-colored grass and filled with fresh flowers and autumn fruits, symbolizing the abundant fruits of the past 40 years since the founding of the nation.

In the southern part of the square, 50 meters north of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, there will be two flower beds on the eastern and western sides, featuring new and excellent varieties of flowers, primarily roses and chrysanthemums, showcasing the flourishing achievements of the capital's construction during the reform and opening-up period.

As in previous years, there will be over 150 scenic spots at major intersections, with over a million potted flowers arranged in various flower beds.

Starting from September 25, the square will be open to organized groups of visitors every day to view the flowers and enjoy performances of Chinese and foreign classical music by the military band outside the East Gate of the Great Hall of the People.

The six major parks responsible for the garden party and entertainment—Zhongshan Park, the Workers' Cultural Palace, Beihai Park, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven, and Taoranting Park—are also being decorated. At that time, 31 professional art troupes from the central government and the municipality will perform, as will visiting art troupes from other provinces. There will also be various forms of entertainment and cultural and sports performances.

On October 1, during the day, the six parks will be open to organized groups for garden parties and entertainment, and all other parks will be open for free. At night, a fireworks display with tens of thousands of participants will be held in Tiananmen Square. The main participants will be workers, peasants, and soldiers, including 8,000 peasant representatives. Cannons will be fired, fireworks will light up the sky, and searchlights will crisscross and change colors; a 400-person military band will perform a marching band concert, 3,000 people will dance in unison, and seven large dragons will dance. The entire city will have nine fireworks display sites. Those who cannot come to Tiananmen Square will still be able to enjoy the colorful fireworks nearby.

    首都一派繁忙迎国庆
    从9月25日起天安门广场有组织地接待群众
    本报北京九月七日讯　记者颜世贵报道：临近国庆，首都的节日气氛一日浓似一日，各项国庆庆祝活动的筹备工作已基本落实，正在抓紧完成最后的工程。
    雄伟的天安门城楼，正抓紧局部粉刷和内部装饰、布置，两侧观礼台也在重新整修、油漆。
    在天安门广场中心，园艺工人正忙着摆设一处大型坡面的花坛。据介绍，花坛的北坡，用串红鲜花组成光芒四射、冉冉升起的红太阳，太阳下有十一朵三米直径的大葵花，寓意全国十一亿各族人民红心向党。花坛南坡为飘扬的巨幅五星红旗，两侧有一九四九—一九八九的纪年大字，示以庆祝建国四十周年。
    广场的北部，建立一座工农兵知识分子的塑像。其东西两侧，用五色草栽制的六米多高的两个大花篮，满篮鲜花秋果，象征着建国四十年的累累硕果。
    广场南部距孙中山画像以北五十米处，分东西两侧，各设一处以市花月季、菊花为主的新优品种花卉的花坛，显示在改革开放中，首都建设事业繁花似锦。
    主要街头路口，也像往年一样，将有一百五十多个景点，摆设上百万盆鲜花，组成各式花坛。
    从九月二十五日起，广场每天即可有组织地接待群众观花，欣赏在大会堂东门外由军乐团演奏的中外名曲。
    承担游园联欢的六大公园——中山公园、劳动人民文化宫、北海公园、颐和园、天坛、陶然亭，也在装点打扮。届时将有中央及市属的三十一个专业文艺团体演出，来京调演的文艺团体也将参加献艺，还有多种多样的游玩和文化体育表演活动。
    “十·一”白天，除这六个公园有组织地进行游园联欢，其他公园全部免费开放。入夜，在天安门广场将举行有十几万人参加的焰火晚会。以工农兵为主体的队伍中，有八千名农民代表。礼炮鸣放，焰火燃天，探照灯光交叉变幻；四百人的军乐团进行分列式演奏，三千人跳起集体舞，七条大龙将翻腾起舞。全市有九个焰火施放点。不能来天安门广场的人们，也能就近观赏到五彩缤纷的焰火。
