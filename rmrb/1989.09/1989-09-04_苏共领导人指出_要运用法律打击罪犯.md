Soviet Communist Party Leader Emphasizes Use of Law to Combat Criminals

According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 1st: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Member and Secretary Chebrikov stated on September 1st that decisive action must be taken to use legal means to crack down on extremists who incite ethnic conflicts and on murderers and robbers.

Chebrikov expressed this view at a meeting of the Academy of Social Sciences.

When discussing the current sharp ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union, Chebrikov pointed out that some people are attempting to undermine the unity of the Soviet multi-ethnic state and to create discord among the people. Those extreme nationalists are more interested in disrupting stability than in the genuine interests of the people of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

    苏共领导人指出
    要运用法律打击罪犯
    据新华社莫斯科9月1日电　苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记切布里科夫9月1日说，应该坚决地行动起来，运用法律力量打击挑唆民族矛盾的极端分子和杀人抢劫犯。
    切布里科夫是在社会科学院的会议上表明上述态度的。
    在谈到当前苏联尖锐的民族冲突时，切布里科夫指出，有人企图破坏苏联多民族国家的统一，在人民中制造不和。那些极端民族主义分子感兴趣的是破坏稳定，而不是立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚人民的真正利益。
