Author: Chen Dapeng
Date: 1989-09-12
Edition: 8

The book "Sunzi Bingfa" holds a prominent position in the history of Chinese warfare, containing wisdom, philosophy, strategy, tactics, and dialectics. On the occasion of the 2500th anniversary of its publication, the Military Science Publishing House has published a new edition of "Sunzi Bingfa" edited by Japanese friend Hattori Chikuharu and Chinese calligrapher Li Tao.

As early as the Warring States period, "Sunzi Bingfa" had already become a household name, a "best-seller." "Houses that keep the books of Sunzi and Wuzi are common." This record shows its popularity at the time. After the Song Dynasty, "Sunzi Bingfa" became even more valuable. The Song Dynasty, in the name of the court, listed "Sunzi Bingfa" as the first of the "Wu Jing" (Military Classics) and made it a required reading for the military examinations. "Sunzi Bingfa" was introduced to Japan during the Ming Dynasty. Over the centuries, it has not only been revered by Japanese martial artists but also by the business and political circles, becoming a textbook for business and political strategies.

Since the publication of "Sunzi Bingfa," there have been countless commentaries and interpretations, but this is the first time a book has appeared in the form of a combination of military science and calligraphy art.

Hattori Chikuharu, also known as Toyoshi, is 52 years old this year. He is a Japanese businessman who manages and operates the Kokko Construction Corporation. From a young age, influenced by his uncle, he has loved Chinese culture. During his youth, he began studying ancient Chinese military texts and has a particular fondness for "Sunzi Bingfa," reading it diligently. In his younger years, to focus on studying military texts, he shaved his eyebrows and went to the mountains, living alone in an ancient temple, shutting himself away from visitors, and studying diligently with nature as his companion. Since 1985, Hattori Chikuharu has visited China four times, exchanging research findings on "Sunzi Bingfa" with Chinese scholars in its hometown. In 1987, the Chinese Academy of Military Science published for the first time Hattori Chikuharu's "Sunzi Bingfa Xuejie," which was praised by "Sunzi Bingfa" enthusiasts both domestically and internationally. This annotated edition is the result of Hattori Chikuharu's decades of hard work.

Li Tao is a familiar calligrapher. However, there are many accomplished calligraphers in China today. Why did Hattori Chikuharu specifically choose Li Tao? This is not only because of Li Tao's calligraphy skills but also because Li Tao is a soldier, possessing the inner qualities of a soldier. This also shows that the requirements for calligraphy emphasize spirit over form. Li Tao began learning calligraphy from a young age, influenced by his family. Over the decades, he has extensively studied the works of famous Chinese calligraphers, learning from the strengths of various masters, not confined to one style, blending ancient and modern techniques. His style is ancient, steady, and fluid, making him an ideal choice for Hattori Chikuharu's calligraphy work.

Each page of this new edition of "Sunzi Bingfa" is one and a half feet wide and three feet long, totaling over a hundred meters when combined, using over 300 sheets of four-foot xuan paper. To complete this calligraphy book, Li Tao shut himself away from visitors for over half a month, spending day and night at his desk, rubbing shoulders with ink and brush. This work, with over a thousand characters, although completed in multiple sessions, maintains a consistent style, rhythm, and spirit from beginning to end. The ink is thick, and the brushwork is heavy.

　　书武联袂　形神相映
    ——《孙子兵法新校字帖》评介
　　陈大鹏
    《孙子兵法》是在中国战争史上占有显著地位的一部奇书，其中包含着智慧、哲理、谋略、战术、辩证法。值此书诞生2500周年之际，军事科学出版社出版了日本友人服部千春先生与我国书法家李铎联袂完成的《孙子兵法新校字帖》。
    早在战国时代，《孙子兵法》就已成为家喻户晓的“畅销书”。“藏孙吴之书者家有之。”从这一记载足见当日之盛况。宋朝以后，《孙子兵法》更是身价百倍，宋朝曾以朝廷的名义把《孙子兵法》列为“武经”之首，规定为考选武举的必读书。《孙子兵法》传到日本是明朝以后的事，几百年来，不仅为日本习武者推崇，也为日本商界、政界等社会各界所青睐，成为各界人士经商从政、韬晦谋略的一部教科书。
    《孙子兵法》问世后，为其注释、通解者不胜枚举，而以军事学术与书法艺术联姻的形式出现，此书尚为首次。
    服部千春，号丰年，今年52岁，日本实业家，主理和经营和光建筑株式会社。他自幼受伯父影响，酷爱中国文化，少年时代即开始研习中国兵学古籍，对《孙子兵法》爱之尤深，读之甚勤。年轻时为专攻兵书，曾剔眉进山，独居古刹，闭门谢客，与山河草木作伴为友，苦心钻研。1985年以来，服部千春曾四次来华，在《孙子兵法》的故乡，与中国学者交流
  《孙子兵法》研究成果。1987年，中国军事科学院首次出版了服部千春所著《孙子兵法校解》，受到了国内外《孙子兵法》爱好者的称道。这部校解倾注了服部千春几十年的心血。
    李铎是人们熟悉的书法家。但中国当前有成就的书法家很多，服部千春为何独钟李铎？这恐怕不仅仅是因为李铎的书艺，更因为李铎是个军人，具军人的内在气质。这也可从另一面看出，对书法的要求重神胜于重形。李铎幼时受其家庭影响开始学书，几十年来，他广搜博览中国书法名家碑帖，借鉴各家所长，不拘一格，师古习今，有古拙沉稳、舒展流畅的风格，接受为服部千春著述作书之邀可谓天作之合。
    这本《孙子兵法新校字帖》的每一页均为尺半宽、三尺长，合起来一百米见长，用了300多张四尺宣纸。为写这本字帖，李铎闭门谢客，逾半月卧于书斋，夜以继日地伏案与翰墨厮磨。这部作品，一千多个字，虽分多次完成，然而字体、风格、气势、笔意一致，从前至后，章法、布局、气韵畅贯。其用墨浓厚，其用笔凝重。
