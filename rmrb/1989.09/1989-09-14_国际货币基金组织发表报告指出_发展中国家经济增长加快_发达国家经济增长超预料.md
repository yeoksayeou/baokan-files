The International Monetary Fund released a report stating that in 1988, the domestic product of developing countries or regions grew by 4.2%, making it "one of the years with the highest economic growth rates in the past decade."

The report pointed out that the economic situations across different continents were quite uneven. The countries and regions with the fastest economic growth were mainly concentrated in Asia. China's economy continued to grow rapidly, reflecting robust investment and consumption. However, investment and economic growth were slow in other developing regions. Some countries in Latin America experienced economic stagnation, and the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa even declined.

The International Monetary Fund's annual report released on September 13 stated that in 1988, the economic growth rate of developed countries just exceeded 4%, which was 0.75% higher than the growth rate in 1987, better than originally expected.

The report said that in 1988, the unemployment rate in developed countries decreased from 7.5% in 1987 to 7%. However, the unemployment rate in Western Europe remained as high as 9.7%.

The report pointed out that inflation in developed countries showed signs of rising, with the increase in consumer prices rising from 3% in 1987 to 3.3% in 1988.
