On November 7, 1931, the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic was established in Ruijin, Jiangxi. Shortly after the establishment of the red regime, some instances of embezzlement and waste emerged. Among the staff of various levels of government, there were cases of arbitrary use of funds, concealment of deposits, embezzlement of public funds, and appropriation of confiscated items (such as gold and silver) for personal use. At that time, the Central Soviet Area was engaged in fierce anti-"encirclement" struggles, and the military situation was extremely severe. If these criminal acts were not promptly stopped, they would inevitably cause great losses to the Red Army and undermine the Party's authority among the people. For this reason, the Central Government launched an anti-embezzlement and anti-waste campaign in the Central Soviet Area starting in February 1932, which continued until October 1934 when the Red Army began the Long March. At that time, the Central Government recognized that embezzlement and waste in the Soviet Area were not isolated social phenomena; these phenomena were intertwined with bureaucratism, mutually causing and reinforcing each other. Therefore, from the outset of the campaign, the focus was on combating bureaucratic corruption and embezzlement. On March 1, 1932, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the Central Government's People's Committee decided to punish embezzlement elements within the government; the Central Government issued a proclamation calling on the masses to supervise the economy of various levels of government and expel embezzlement elements. Subsequently, the Central Government took the lead in conducting investigations and exposing misconduct in several dozen central agencies; at the same time, it entrusted the Central Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department to handle the daily affairs of this work and, together with the Soviet Executive Committee, trade unions, the military, and the Young Pioneers, formed a "Temporary Investigation Committee"; the Central Audit Commission was responsible for reviewing the financial situation of various departments. The central organ newspaper *Red China* also created public opinion, exposing various instances of embezzlement, waste, and bureaucratism.

Through investigations and exposures, a batch of bureaucrats and embezzlement elements were identified, uncovering embezzled funds amounting to more than 2,000 yuan, and exposing more than 40 bureaucrats and embezzlement elements, including one bureau chief, three division chiefs, six section chiefs, and several factory directors, institute directors, and bureau chiefs. Twenty-nine individuals were handed over to the court for punishment. At that time, the Central Executive Committee formulated strict punishment regulations, ranging from warnings to confiscation of property, up to the death penalty (for those who embezzled 300 yuan or more).

    中央苏区的反腐败运动
    1931年11月7日，中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府在江西瑞金宣告成立。红色政权建立后不久，出现了一些贪污和浪费现象。各级政府的工作人员中，有随便乱用，隐报存款、吞没公款，把没收来的东西（如金银物品等）随便据为己有的现象。其时，中央苏区正在进行激烈的反“围剿”斗争，军事形势相当严峻。如果不及时制止这些犯罪行为，势必给红军造成极大的损失，使党在人民中失去威信。为此，中央政府从1932年2月起，在中央苏区开展了反贪污浪费的斗争，直到1934年10月红军开始长征时为止。当时，中央政府确认，贪污浪费在苏区并不是一种孤立的社会现象，这种现象和官僚主义是交织在一起，互为因果的。因此从斗争一开始，就以反官僚腐化和反贪污浪费为工作重心。1932年3月1日，中央政府人民委员会第八次常委会议决：惩办政府工作人员中的贪污分子；中央颁发布告，号召群众监督各级政府经济，并驱逐贪污分子。此后，中央政府带头在中央几十个机关进行检举、揭发；同时，还责成中央工农检查部负责这项工作的日常事务，并会同苏维埃主席团、工会、军队、少先队组成“临时检举委员会”；中央审计委员会负责审查各部门的财务情况。中央机关报《红色中华报》还大造舆论，揭露种种贪污浪费行为和官僚主义现象。
    经过揭发、检举，查处了一批官僚主义者和贪污分子，查出贪污钱款2000多元，检举出官僚主义者和贪污分子40多人，其中厅长1人，局长3人，处长6人，还有一些厂长、所长、科长等。送交法庭制裁者有29人。当时，中央执行委员会制定了严格的惩治条例，从警告处分到没收家产，直至判处死刑（贪污300元以上者）。
