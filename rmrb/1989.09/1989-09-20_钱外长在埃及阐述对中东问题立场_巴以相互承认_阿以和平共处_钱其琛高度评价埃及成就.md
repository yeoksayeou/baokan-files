Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today articulated China's stance on the Middle East issue here, stating, "The ultimate resolution of the Middle East problem lies in the mutual recognition of Palestine and Israel, and the peaceful coexistence of the Arab nation and the Jewish nation."

Qian Qichen, who arrived here this afternoon for a visit to Egypt, held a sincere and friendly 1.5-hour meeting with Egyptian Vice President and Foreign Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali. They discussed the Middle East situation, the Lebanese issue, African issues, and bilateral friendly relations. Both sides exchanged views on the latest developments in the Middle East and issues of common concern. The foreign ministers of China and Egypt reached broad consensus during the talks.

During the meeting, Qian expressed that the Middle East problem should be resolved through political means. We advocate for an international peace conference on the Middle East, convened under the auspices of the United Nations and attended by relevant parties and the five permanent members of the Security Council.

The Chinese foreign minister said that in preparation for the international conference, dialogues and consultations among the parties to the Middle East conflict are beneficial for promoting the peace process. Qian highly appreciated the proactive measures taken by the Egyptian government to advance Middle East peace.

Qian stated that Israel's suppression of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories is not in its interest. Israel can only ensure its security by immediately stopping the suppression and withdrawing from the occupied territories.

Qian also expressed that as a permanent member of the Security Council, China is willing to make its due contribution to promoting the Middle East peace process.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen praised Egypt's achievements in economic construction and friendly diplomacy under President Hosni Mubarak in recent years, and highly evaluated Egypt's active efforts and contributions to promoting the peace process.

At the welcome banquet hosted by the Egyptian foreign minister for him this evening, Qian said, "Under the leadership of President Mubarak, the Egyptian government and people have made unremitting efforts to develop the national economy and build their own country, achieving commendable results. Egypt pursues a policy of peace, friendship, and non-alignment, actively developing relations with other Arab countries, strengthening Arab unity and cooperation, supporting the just cause of the Palestinian people, and making active efforts and contributions to promoting the Middle East peace process."
