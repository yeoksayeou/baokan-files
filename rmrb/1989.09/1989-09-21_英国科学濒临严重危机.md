The British newspaper *Daily Telegraph* published an editorial titled "Science Crisis" stating that British science is facing a severe crisis.

The editorial says that British science is in danger of losing its top talent. Bright young people are finding that science is no longer attractive enough. They are not taking science courses in high school and university. Even if they do take science courses, they will quickly abandon them to pursue other, better-paying professions, or go abroad to work.

The editorial warns that trained and experienced researchers are continuously leaving the country. They find that they can earn several times more working abroad than in Britain. The shortage of science teachers affects the next generation, causing the decline of science to continue automatically.

The editorial emphasizes that what British science needs is "to give science graduates the status and remuneration they deserve, reward trained teachers, and make high schools and universities places with a future worth pursuing."

The editorial concludes: "An atmosphere that truly values science must be created."

    英国科学濒临严重危机
    新华社伦敦9月19日电  英国《每日电讯报》发表题为《科学危机》的社论说，英国科学濒临严重的危机。
    社论说，英国科学处于失去其主要人才的危险中。聪明的年轻人发现，科学不再具有足够的吸引力。他们在中学和大学不学理科课程。即使他们学了理科课程，也会很快抛弃掉，改行从事别的报酬高的职业，或者出国工作。
    社论提醒说，训练有素的、有经验的研究人员不断外流。他们发现，出国工作比在英国能挣高出几倍的工资。理科教师短缺影响下一代，使科学的下降自动继续下去。
    社论强调，英国科学所需要的是，“给理科毕业生以应得的地位和报酬，奖励训练有素的教师，使中学和大学成为有前途的、值得追求的地方”。
    社论最后说：“要创造如实对待科学的气氛。”
