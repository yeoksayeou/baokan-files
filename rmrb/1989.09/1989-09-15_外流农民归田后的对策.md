Edition: 6

	In a previous period, millions of farmers left their fields to engage in commerce and work. Currently, a large number of these migrant workers are returning to their villages. Due to the prolonged absence of many individuals, their fields have become barren; there is an excess of labor, and opportunities for enrichment are scarce. Therefore, some people have become disheartened, frequently petitioning, protesting, and even causing disturbances, becoming a potential source of social unrest. This issue requires our serious attention.

	Firstly, relevant departments should take measures to help solve the practical difficulties faced by these returning farmers. For the ideological issues that have surfaced among them, we must strengthen ideological and political work to effectively eliminate factors of instability.

	In the long term, we must vigorously develop production within the agricultural sector and establish labor-intensive township enterprises to serve as a "reservoir" that can absorb a large number of laborers. We should also rationally guide the surplus agricultural labor force, such as directing them towards the undeveloped sectors within agriculture.

　　外流农民归田后的对策
    前一时期，数以百万计的农民纷纷离开田园经商做工。目前，又有大批外流大军归田。由于许多人长期在外，田园荒芜；劳力剩余，致富无门。因此，有的人情绪消极，经常上访、请愿，甚至闹事，成为社会上一股潜在的不安定因素。这个问题需要引起我们足够的重视。
    首先，对这些返乡农民的现实困难，有关部门可采取措施，设法帮助解决。对他们中暴露出来的思想问题，要切实加强思想政治工作，努力消除不安定的因素。
    从长远看，还要大力发展农业内部的开发性生产，兴办劳动密集型乡镇企业，使之成为能容纳大量劳动力的“蓄水池”。对农村剩余劳动力进行合理的导向，如引导剩余劳动力向农业内部未开发的部分流动等。
