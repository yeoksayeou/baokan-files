The Jingtai River irrigation area is located in the central part of Jingtai County. After the Jingtai River electric water lifting project started supplying water, a large number of mountain farmers who had long suffered from drought began to move here to build new homes. This once barren land, covered with sand dunes, is now crisscrossed with irrigation channels and lined with trees, yielding abundant grain and thriving with various industries, transforming into a lush new oasis.

Badaquan is a purely immigrant township. Accompanied by Township Head Wang Youguo, we visited the home of Wang Jie in the second village of Badaquan. His five new rooms are clean and spacious, equipped with modern furniture such as sofas. Wang Jie said that his family originally lived in the western mountain area of Sitan Township, where they relied on subsidies for food and aid for money. Since moving here, their lives have improved year by year. This year, his 12 mu of wheat yielded nearly 5,000 kilograms of grain. We then visited Caowotan Township's Changcheng Village, where all 80-plus immigrant households have 3 cars, 60-plus large, medium, and small tractors, and every family has a television. The entire village is filled with new houses. The living standards of Changcheng Village's immigrants are at the mid-level in the entire irrigation area.

Jingtai County is one of the 18 arid counties in central Gansu, with an annual rainfall of only 185 millimeters. Although the Yellow River flows through the county, "the water flows below, people worry above, crops wither and die, nine out of ten harvests fail," and farmers often migrate out. Starting in 1969, the state invested 60.7 million yuan to build the Jingtai River electric water lifting project. The main construction was completed in May 1974, turning 290,000 mu of sand flats into fertile fields, and gradually moving in 49,000-plus mountain immigrants. In 1975, Jingtai County ended its history of relying on returned grain, and by 1988, the county's total grain production had doubled, providing 8.42 million kilograms of commercial grain to the state.

　　景泰川里移民乐
    景泰川引黄灌区位于景泰县中部。景泰川电力提灌工程上水之后，饱尝干旱之苦的一大批山区农民，陆续迁移来到这里建设新家园。这块昔日满目沙丘的千古荒滩，如今阡陌纵横，渠网配套，林茂粮丰，百业兴旺，变成了丰饶的新绿洲。
    八道泉，是一个纯粹的移民乡。在乡长王有国的陪同下，我们来到八道泉村二组农民王杰家，5间新房子整洁宽敞，沙发等时兴家具一应齐全。王杰说，他家原来在西部山区的寺滩乡，吃粮靠供应，花钱靠救济。自从移到这里，日子一年胜似一年。今年12亩麦子，收粮将近5000公斤。我们来到草窝滩乡长城村，看到全村80多户移民，已有3辆汽车、60多台大中小型拖拉机，家家都有了电视机，全村清一色的新房子。长城村移民的生活，在整个灌区只是中等水平。
    景泰县是甘肃中部18个干旱县之一，年降水量只有185毫米。虽然黄河穿过县境，但是“水在低处流，人在高处愁，禾苗枯黄焦，十种九不收”，农民经常外流。从1969年开始，国家投资6070万元兴建景泰川电力提灌工程，1974年5月主体工程建成，使29万多亩沙滩变成良田，陆续从山区移来了49000多个农民。景泰县1975年结束了吃回销粮的历史，到1988年全县粮食总产翻了一番，向国家提供商品粮842万公斤。（马同顺）
