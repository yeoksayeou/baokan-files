From April 18 to 24, 1955, the Asian-African Conference, jointly initiated by the prime ministers of Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), was held in Bandung, Indonesia. Twenty-nine Asian and African countries participated. The final communiqué issued by the conference clearly declared that colonialism is a "scourge that must be quickly eradicated," supported the struggle of peoples of all countries for freedom and independence, and the principle of self-determination. It urged all countries to pay attention to the danger of a world war and declared that universal disarmament is necessary for maintaining peace. The conference adopted the famous "Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" and passed resolutions on economic and cultural cooperation among Asian and African countries. The conference reflected the common aspirations and demands of the Asian and African peoples to oppose colonialism and aggressive wars, safeguard national independence and world peace, and promote friendly cooperation among all countries.
