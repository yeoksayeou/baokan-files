Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 18th.

From nothing to something, from weak to strong, the People's Air Force, born with the founding of New China, has now developed into a formidable fighting force with significant capabilities in long-range combat, high-speed maneuvering, powerful strikes, and air defense, playing a crucial role in safeguarding the motherland.

The People's Air Force was officially established on November 11, 1949. Over the past 40 years, it has grown from nothing to a substantial force, becoming a technical branch of the military with a relatively complete array of aviation units, anti-aircraft missile units, anti-aircraft artillery units, radar units, airborne troops, and other specialized units.

In its early days, the Air Force relied mainly on imported weapons. Today, all types of fighter jets, attack aircraft, bombers, and reconnaissance aircraft are domestically produced. Transport aircraft, helicopters, and other specialized aircraft designed and manufactured in China are also in service. The People's Air Force currently ranks third in the world in terms of the number of various types of aircraft.

The political and military quality of personnel at all levels has significantly improved. The commanders of the Air Force Command and the Air Force of military regions, as well as the commanders of aviation regiments, divisions, and brigades, are all pilots. Aviation regiment commanders can all lead their units into combat. All pilots have reached at least a college-level education, with 80% being high-level pilots. The number of all-weather pilots has increased 16.4 times compared to 10 years ago.

　　从无到有　由弱到强
　　我空军已具相当规模
    据新华社北京9月18日电　（记者蔡善武）随着新中国的成立而诞生的人民空军，已经具备了一定水平的远程作战、高速机动、猛烈突击和对空防御能力，成为保卫祖国的坚强的战斗力量。
    人民空军正式创建于1949年11月11日。40年来，从无到有，由弱到强，如今已发展成为以航空兵为主体，地空导弹兵、高射炮兵、雷达兵、空降兵和其他专业兵种较为齐全的技术军种。
    空军初创时期，武器装备主要靠进口。现在空军各型歼击机、强击机、轰炸机、侦察机全部国产化。我国自行设计的运输机、直升机以及其他专业飞机也随之装备了部队。我空军目前拥有的各型飞机数量居世界第三位。
    各级各类人员的军政素质普遍提高。军委空军和军区空军司令员以及航空兵部队的军、师、团长都会飞行，航空兵师长全部能够带队升空作战。飞行人员已全部达到大专以上文化水平，等级飞行员占80％以上，全天候飞行员的数量比10年前增加16.4倍。
