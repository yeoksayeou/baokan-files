The novel "Urban Romance" by Sun Li and Yu Xiaohui, set against the backdrop of the reform and construction of a certain coastal city, focuses not on the problems encountered during the reform process, as is common in similar works, but rather on the design of the ideal national character under the impetus of reform. If the rejection of heroism and the pursuit of authenticity in literature is considered a current trend, then "Urban Romance" takes a different path, avoiding trends and promoting ideals.

The characters in the novel can be seen as various designs of the ideal national character under the impetus of reform. They exhibit wisdom, willpower, and moral strength at different levels, embodying a humanistic ideal. Mayor Yan Honghuan, a former intellectual, does not shirk his responsibility as the "parent official" of the city's people. He firmly plants his feet in the reality of the earth, understands the people's grievances, and uses this as the driving force for his work. With the courage of a desperate battle, flexible strategies, and an iron fist, he creates miracles in the construction of urban housing and urban renewal, making people understand the speed and potential of modernization, appreciate modern management methods and leadership art, and see the ideal character of a leader that the people yearn for. Usually, the position of a leader acts as an amplifier, and the character of a leader in such a position can have a significant impact on the group. Yan Honghuan's ability to face the obstacles posed by the conservative forces represented by Gao Boyuan, take risks, and boldly adopt a construction plan starting from the transformation of the city's transportation roads, and activate the city's "body" by unblocking the city's "blood vessels" is due to his wisdom in grasping the overall situation and his decisiveness, tenacity, confidence, and courage. He believes that he took up the position of mayor precisely to create the grandeur of modernization construction, and he wants to make a decisive cut, causing fundamental changes in the entire city. Wisdom and willpower are the keys to his leadership qualifications, and they also enable him to gain the corresponding leadership art. He supports the engineering command department's decision to adopt bidding and layer-by-layer contracting methods due to the urgency and difficulty of the road reconstruction project, as well as the decision to allow contracting units to retain surplus funds, indicating his understanding of the target value of laborers under the impetus of reform.

Chief Engineer Xu Lili, to realize his career and romantic ideals, completes the design of the Guangming Interchange in the face of a terminal illness and life-threatening situation. He faces the challenges of life with an active combat posture, integrating the wisdom, willpower, and moral strength of intellectuals into an ideal character. Construction team leader Yang Jianhua, delinquent youth Chen Baozhu, and "Old Team Leader" and others all demonstrate, to varying degrees, the transcendence of the traditional self-shrinking character defined by Chinese culture in the mundane aspects of life under the impetus of reform.

It should be noted that "Urban Romance" does not fall into the trap of false, model-like descriptions in its design of the ideal national character. Instead, it is completed through the fusion of flesh and blood in the vicissitudes of characters' fates. Additionally, there are many characters in the work who can be seen as non-ideal character embodiments. They respectively highlight and strengthen the charm of the ideal character from the side or the opposite side. Due to long-term leadership positions, Gao Boyuan, who is obsessed with personal power and lacks the necessary modern leadership consciousness and professional knowledge; Zhang Wenmin, who, driven by evil desires, schemes and jumps between the highest levels of the municipal leadership to find a shortcut to officialdom; Xu Yuanzhao, who lives in decadence and delights in "official profiteering" with impunity, all serve as foils to the beauty of the ideal character, ensuring that the work remains grounded in the exposure and criticism of social ugliness while promoting ideals and beautiful life.

Of course, there are also flaws, especially in the setting of characters in the work, where the coincidences are too deliberate and cannot be ignored. For example, Xu Lili, the wife of the deputy mayor, is precisely Mayor Yan Honghuan's former lover, leading to a series of "unresolved" stories, which seem somewhat intentionally added for dramatic effect. Yang Jianhua's image is already quite rich, but in the novel's ending, he is suddenly revealed to be the posthumous son of the former wife of the municipal party secretary, Gao Boyuan, which is somewhat unrealistic. It can be seen that the author has borrowed the techniques of playwriting, concentrating many character relationships and entanglements in a single street and a villa housing municipal officials; forming two extreme life scenes that are interconnected and mutually reflective, but the charm of the novel lies in its ability to utilize the freedom of time and space, breaking the objective limitations of time and space in a "play," and merging oneself into the flow of life. Perhaps due to neglect in this aspect, it leads to certain oversights in the author's macro-control of character structure.

    改革激发下的理想人格设计
    ——谈《都市风流》
    王绯
    孙力、余小慧的长篇小说《都市风流》，以某滨海城市的改革建设为背景，在上至市级最高领导人、下至市井细民的两极人生画面中，所着眼的似乎不是同类题材作品对改革进程中这样或那样问题的思索，而是对改革激化下国民理想人格的设计。如果把反崇高反英雄当作时下文学贴近人生本真的一种趋尚，那么《都市风流》所走的显然是一条避开时尚、弘扬理想的路。
    为这条路开道的小说人物，完全可以视为改革激发下国民理想人格的诸种形象设计，他们在不同层次上所显示出来的智慧力量、意志力量、道德力量，表现出具有人类意义的人格理想。知识分子出身的市长阎鸿唤，不负全城百姓
  “衣食父母官”的使命，把双脚坚实地立在现实的泥土中，体察民情，深知民怨，并以此作为开展工作的动力。他靠背水一战的气魄、灵活的策略和铁的手腕，在市民住宅和城市改造的建设中所创造的奇迹，不仅使人们懂得了现代化建设的速度和潜力，领教了现代管理的手段和领导艺术，更看到了一种民众渴望的领导者的理想人格。通常，领导的职位犹如放大器，身居此要位的领导人的品格对其团体会产生非同小可的影响。阎鸿唤之所以能面对以高伯年为代表的守旧势力的种种阻挠，铤而走险，大胆采用从改造整个城市的交通道路入手，通过疏理城市“血脉”而使城市“肌体”活起来的建设方案，有赖于他把握全局的智慧力量，也得力于他的果决、顽强、自信和勇气。他以为自己正是为了创造现代化建设宏大的气势而出任市长的，他要使自己选定的一斧子砍下去，让全城发生根本的变化。智慧力量和意志力量是他取得领导资格的关键，同时又使他获得了与之相应的领导艺术。他支持工程指挥部根据道路改造工程任务的突击性和艰巨性所采取的投标和层层承包的方式，以及允许承包单位提成节余费的决策，说明他对改革激发下劳动者目标价值的了解。总工程师徐力里为了实现自己的事业理想和爱情理想，在身患绝症、生命临危的情况下，完成了光明立交桥的设计，以积极的应战姿态面对生活的挑战，将知识分子的智慧力量，意志力量和道德力量提升到理想人格的一种整合状态。施工队队长杨建华、失足青年陈宝柱，以及“老队长”等人，均在世俗人生的层面上展示出改革激发下普通民众不同程度地超越了中国传统文化所注定的自我萎缩型人格。
    需要说明的是，《都市风流》对国民理想人格的设计，并没有流于虚假的样板式摹写，而是通过血肉的熔铸，在人物命运的波澜中完成的。另外，作品中还有不少人物可以视非理想人格的肉身，他们分别从侧面或反面突出和强化着理想人格的魅力。由于长期处在领导者的位置，对个人权力耿耿于怀又缺乏应有的现代领导意识和专业知识的高伯年；在私欲的恶性膨胀下极尽巧伪之能事，上窜下跳于市级最高领导层寻找通达仕途捷径的张文民；生活堕落，津津乐道于
  “官倒”且有恃无恐的徐援朝等，均作为理想人格之美的一种陪衬，使作品在对理想和美人生的弘扬中始终不脱离对社会丑现实的揭露与批判。《都市风流》并不乏丑形态的展露，但这种展露不具有独立意义，是作为美的对立物以衬托，凸现美。
    当然，败笔也是有的，特别是作品中人物设置巧合有余的纰漏不能不提出来，比如身为副市长夫人的徐力里恰是市长阎鸿唤早年的恋人，因之引出一系列“斩不断、理还乱”的故事，显得有些故意加佐料“凑戏”，画蛇添足了；杨建华的形象其实已够丰满，在小说结尾处偏偏成了市委书记高伯年前妻的遗腹子，未免有些失真。可以看出作者在创作手法上借鉴了写戏的路子，一条普店街，一座住着市里要人的利华别墅，把众多的人物关系与纠葛集中起来；组合成彼此联系又相互映照的两极人生画面轮番显现，但是小说的妙处恰在于可以利用时间和空间上的自由度，打碎“戏”的时间与空间的客观限定，将自己融入生活流。或许是由于这方面的忽视，导致了作者在人物结构的宏观把握上的某些疏漏。
