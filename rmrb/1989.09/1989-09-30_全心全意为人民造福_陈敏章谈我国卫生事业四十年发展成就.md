In the days leading up to National Day, Chen Minzhang, the Minister of Health, who had just returned from a trip, shared his "National Day Reflections" with a reporter.

"Over the past 40 years, through wind and rain, China's healthcare industry has grown alongside the motherland, achieving remarkable accomplishments that have caught the attention of the world. Before 1949, the Chinese people, once derided by foreigners as the 'Sick Man of East Asia,' were plagued by poverty and illness, lacking in medical care and medicine. The average life expectancy was only 35 years, the infant mortality rate was as high as 250 per 1,000, and the maternal mortality rate was above 15 per 1,000. By 1988, the average life expectancy in China had risen to over 69 years, the infant mortality rate had dropped to below 35 per 1,000, and the maternal mortality rate had decreased to below 0.5 per 1,000. From 1949 to 1988, the number of healthcare institutions grew from 3,700 to 206,000, hospital beds increased from 85,000 to 2.8 million, and the number of professional healthcare workers per 1,000 people rose from 0.93 to 3.43. Achieving such remarkable results would have been impossible without the tireless efforts of the Party and the government."

At this point, this veteran doctor, who has spent decades in medical practice and health administration and still sees patients in his spare time, became quite emotional:

"In conditions where medical supplies were extremely backward and health situations were dire, the Party and the government formulated the four principles of 'serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, emphasizing prevention, uniting traditional and Western medicine, and combining health work with mass movements' to develop China's healthcare industry. Forty years of practice have proven that these four principles are correct. They represent the fundamental interests of the people and reflect the objective laws of health work. They have indeed had a significant impact on the development of China's healthcare industry."

"The government has invested in the healthcare industry over the past 40 years?" the reporter wanted to know more specifics.

"'Serving the people' has always been the guiding principle of healthcare work. For example, currently, 94 million people in state-owned enterprises enjoy free or subsidized medical care; 50 million direct relatives of enterprise employees also receive certain medical and health benefits; and another 20 million employees in large collective enterprises also follow the labor insurance medical care system. It is estimated that more than 80% of urban residents enjoy free or subsidized medical care. Currently, the country and enterprises spend 12 billion yuan annually on free and labor insurance medical care. In rural areas, a three-tier medical and health service network has been established, with 88% of rural healthcare institutions equipped with healthcare personnel, basic equipment, and facilities. The radius of rural medical services (the distance from home to the nearest medical institution) is within 1 kilometer for 64.4%, 1-2 kilometers for 17.5%, 2-3 kilometers for 7.1%, and over 3 kilometers for 11%. The state also implements medical fees below cost and reduces the prices of basic medicines to ensure that the majority of rural residents receive basic medical care; to improve the rural health environment and prevent diseases, the state has invested more than 5 billion yuan in rural water improvement projects, benefiting 510 million farmers with varying degrees of improved drinking water hygiene."

After hearing this, the reporter was deeply moved: "Often, we only see the gains and losses around us, paying little attention to the efforts made by the state at the macro level, and thus cannot objectively evaluate our achievements."

"Yes! Currently, the annual healthcare expenditure by the state has increased from 190 million yuan in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, 2.24 billion yuan in 1978, 5.48 billion yuan in 1985, to 6.5 billion yuan this year; the basic construction funds for healthcare have increased from 130 million yuan in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, 320 million yuan in 1978, to 2 billion yuan this year. Due to the continuous improvement of medical and health conditions, China has made significant progress in the prevention and treatment of infectious and contagious diseases, which were once the main causes of death. The overall mortality rate has dropped from 25 per 1,000 before liberation to 14 per 1,000 in the 1950s, 12 per 1,000 in the 1960s, and 6.8 per 1,000 in 1987. The improvement in health levels is also reflected in the significant improvement in the nutritional status and growth and development of children and adolescents. Currently, the proportion of newborns with a birth weight greater than 2,500 grams is 92.1% in cities and 90.2% in rural areas, both of which have exceeded the 90% target set by the World Health Organization's 'Health for All by the Year 2000' ahead of schedule. A 1985 survey showed that the acceleration trend of growth and development among Chinese adolescents has surpassed the Japanese level of the same period, comparable to the urban level and higher than the rural level in Japan during the 10 years (1960-1970) when Japanese adolescents developed the fastest. The nutritional intake of Chinese residents from food, as surveyed in 1982, averaged 66.8 grams of protein, 49.3 grams of fat, 444 grams of sugar, and 2,485 calories per person per day, already higher than the average for Asian countries."

Minister Chen Minzhang finally mentioned that over the past 40 years of healthcare development, a team of 4 million professional medical and health workers has been cultivated. They have responded to numerous earthquakes, floods, food poisoning, and other sudden accidents, arriving promptly, fighting bravely, and winning victories. With their selfless socialist humanitarian spirit and excellent medical skills, they have completed their missions excellently, receiving affirmation and praise from international public opinion, and becoming a source of pride for the Party and the people of the entire nation.

    全心全意为人民造福
    ——陈敏章谈我国卫生事业四十年发展成就本报记者艾笑
    国庆前夕，刚从外地归来的卫生部部长陈敏章，向记者发表了他的“国庆抒怀”。
    “40年风风雨雨，我国的卫生事业和祖国共命运齐壮大，取得了令全世界瞩目的伟大成就。1949年以前，被外国人鄙称为“东亚病夫”的中国人民贫病交加缺医少药，人口的平均寿命只有35岁，婴儿死亡率高达千分之二百五十，孕产妇死亡率也在千分之十五以上。而1988年我国人口的平均寿命已达到69岁以上，婴儿死亡率减少到千分之三十五以下，孕产妇死亡率也下降到千分之零点五以下。1949年至1988年，卫生机构从0.37万个发展到20.6万个，医院床位从8.5万张发展到280万张，每千人口有专业卫生技术人员从0.93人发展到3.43人。取得这样惊人的成绩，没有党和政府艰苦卓绝的努力，是绝对办不到的。”
    谈到这里，这位从事了几十年医学临床和卫生行政管理工作、现仍在公务间隙坚持出诊的老医生，十分动情：
      “在医药条件十分落后、卫生状况相当恶劣的情况下，党和政府制定了‘面向工农兵，预防为主，团结中西医，卫生工作与群众运动相结合’的四大方针，来发展我国的卫生事业。40年的实践证明，这四大方针是十分正确的。它既代表了人民群众的根本利益，又反映了卫生工作的客观规律。它的确对我国的卫生事业发展产生了重大作用和深远影响。”
    “40年中，政府对卫生事业的投入有哪些？”记者想了解得更具体些。
    “‘为人民服务’始终是卫生工作的宗旨。比如，目前全民所有制单位享受公费、劳保医疗的人数已达9400多万；由企业职工供养的直系亲属有5000多万也在享受一定的医疗保健待遇；还有2000多万大集体单位职工也执行劳保医疗。据估算，全国城市地区居民有80％以上享受了免费或半免费医疗。目前，每年国家和企业用于公费和劳保医疗的经费为120亿元。农村建立了三级医疗保健网，已使88％的农村卫生机构具备了卫技人员、基础设备和房屋三配套；农村医疗服务半径（即从家中到最近的医疗机构的距离），1公里以内的已达64.4％，1—2公里的占17.5％，2—3公里的占7.1％，3公里以上的占11％。国家还实行低于成本的医疗收费，降低基本药品的价格，以使广大农村居民能得到基本的医疗保障；为改善农村卫生环境预防疾病，国家又投资了50多亿元用于农村改水，使5.1亿农民的饮水卫生得到了不同程度的改善。”
    听了这些，记者受到强烈感染：“通常，我们往往只看个人周围的局部得失，对国家宏观上做出的努力很少注意，自然就不能客观地评价我们的成绩了。”
    “是啊！目前国家每年投入的卫生事业费，已由建国初期的1.9亿元、1978年的22.4亿元、1985年的54.8亿元，增加到今年的65亿元；卫生基本建设费已由建国初期的1.3亿元、1978年的3.2亿元，增加到今年的20亿元。由于医疗卫生条件的不断改善，我国过去成为主要死亡原因的传染性感染性疾病的防治取得明显成效，人口总死亡率由解放前的千分之二十五迅速下降，50年代为千分之十四，60年代千分之十二，1987年达千分之六点八。健康水平的提高还表现在我国居民营养状况和儿童、青少年生长发育情况有明显改善。现在的婴儿出生体重大于2500克的，城市里占总数的92.1％，农村里占总数的90.2％，都提前超过了世界卫生组织规定的‘2000年人人享有卫生保健’中规定的90％的指标要求。1985年的调查表明，我国青少年生长发育加速的趋势已超过日本同期水平，与日本青少年发育速度最快的10年（1960——1970年）比较，城市的水平相当，农村的水平则高出日本。我国居民从食物中摄入的营养，1982年调查，每人每天的平均摄入量，蛋白质66.8克，脂肪49.3克，糖444克，热量2485千卡，已高于亚洲国家的平均值。”
    陈敏章部长最后谈到，40年卫生事业的发展同时，还造就了我国一支400万人的专业医疗卫生队伍。他们在无数次地震、水灾、食物中毒等突发事故的抢救中，招之即来，来之能战，战之能胜，以忘我的社会主义人道主义精神和高超的医术，出色地完成任务，受到国际舆论的肯定和赞扬，成为党和全国人民的骄傲。
