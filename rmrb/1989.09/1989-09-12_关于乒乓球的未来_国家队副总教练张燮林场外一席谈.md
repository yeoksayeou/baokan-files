On the evening of September 11, the National Youth Games table tennis team finals were in full swing at the Fushun Gymnasium. The reporter and national table tennis team deputy head coach Zhang Xianlin sat together in the stands, chatting casually for half the evening. The topic naturally revolved around table tennis.

This National Youth Games table tennis tournament was held after the Chinese team suffered setbacks at the Dortmund World Championships this year. However, the audience here still showed great enthusiasm. No wonder, Zhang Xianlin said, stars like Henan's Deng Yaping and Beijing's 15-year-old Wang Chen did not lose a single point in the women's team competition, and the final match was a tough battle. The two nights of competition went on until midnight, and those who were still cheering in the stands could be considered the basic audience for table tennis.

When discussing the future of table tennis, Zhang Xianlin said that the current mainstay of the national team, including Ma Wen-ge and Yu Shentong of the men's team and Qiao Hong and Chen Jing of the women's team, are all around 20 years old. By the next Olympics, they will be 23, which is the prime of their careers. After that, the national team may face another transition period of new and old players. The successors will have to be selected from the young players competing in this Youth Games. However, many athletes here are only 13 or 14 years old, and their bodies are still developing. Their physical condition and technical development prospects are not something that can be determined right away.

For athletes who are a bit older, higher standards must be applied because they are now competing with Deng Yaping in the Youth Games, but Deng Yaping is only 16 or 17 years old and is already a world champion.

In addition to talent, table tennis itself is also undergoing a period of change. Zhang Xianlin told the reporter that he recently led the team to Japan to participate in an international competition, using yellow balls and blue tables, which are very eye-catching. Shanghai in China has already started trial production of this new generation of table tennis balls and tables. Athletes can adapt after a period of training and will not be hindered. This old national champion, who won multiple world championships in the 1960s and was known as the "Magician," specifically asked Zhang Xianlin about his evaluation of the chopping technique. He said that it is now very difficult to play the chopping technique. China, North Korea, and Japan have higher levels of chopping technique, while Europe has almost no one playing the chopping technique. This time, Hebei's Zheng Yuan is playing the chopping technique. As a technique, it will still exist.

In casual conversation, Zhang Xianlin also mentioned sports propaganda. He believes that propaganda should be comprehensive. Simply and vaguely talking about the crisis in table tennis is not necessarily beneficial. People should have a detailed understanding of the characteristics and advantages of Chinese table tennis technology, knowing the wisdom, skills, and charm it contains, so as to attract more children to play table tennis. Otherwise, if you keep talking about the crisis every day, who will still want to play table tennis!

### 关于乒乓球的未来——国家队副总教练张燮林场外一席谈

　　关于乒乓球的未来
    ——国家队副总教练张燮林场外一席谈
    9月11日晚，抚顺体育馆里的青运会乒乓球团体决赛打得正热闹。记者和国家乒乓球队副总教练张燮林一块在看台上观战，拉拉杂杂地聊了半天，话题自然始终不离乒乓球。
    这次青运会乒乓球赛，是在中国队经历今年多特蒙德世界锦标赛受挫之后举行的，但是这里的观众仍表现出极大热情。这也难怪，张燮林说，像河南名将邓亚萍和北京队15岁的王晨在女子团体赛里一直没丢过分，决赛相遇打得难解难分，本身就是世界水平的较量嘛。这两天晚上的比赛直打到午夜，那些还在看台上大喊加油的算得上乒乓球运动的基本观众了。
    谈到乒乓球运动的后备力量，张燮林说，现在国家队的主力阵容，包括男队的马文革、于沈潼和女队的乔红、陈静，都在20岁左右，到下届奥运会时才23岁，正是成熟的时期。在那以后，国家队有可能再次面临新老交替的过渡，接班人就要从现在打青运会的小将当中挑选。不过，这次不少运动员只有13、14岁，身体正在发育，身体素质和技术发展的前景不是一下子就能看准的。
    对年岁再大一点的运动员则要用高标准来要求，因为她们现在跟邓亚萍同场参加青运会，可邓亚萍才16、17岁，已经是世界冠军了。
    除了人才方面，乒乓球运动本身也正处变革时代。张燮林告诉记者，不久前他带队去日本参加国际比赛，使用的是黄色的球和蓝色的球台，颜色很醒目。我国上海已开始试制这种新一代乒乓球和球台。运动员练一段就能适应，不会有什么妨碍。这位在60年代屡夺世界冠军的老国手曾有“魔术师”之称，记者特意问到张燮林对削球打法的评价。他说，现在打削球很难打出来，中国、朝鲜和日本削球手水平高一些，欧洲就没什么人打削球了。这次河北女队郑源就是打削球的。作为一种打法还会存在。
    与记者闲谈，张燮林又说到体育宣传。他认为，宣传要全面，简单而笼统地讲乒乓危机，并不见得有利。要让人们详实地了解中国乒乓球技术的特点和长处，知道这里面包含的智慧、技巧及其魅力所在，才会吸引更多的孩子来打球。不然，天天喊危机，谁还愿意打乒乓球呢！本报记者　汪大昭
