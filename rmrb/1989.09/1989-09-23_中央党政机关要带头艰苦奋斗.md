The State Council has made a serious decision regarding the Ministry of Light Industry's construction of a luxurious office building that exceeded standards and budgets and misused funds. The new office building will be handed over to the State Council's Bureau of Administrative Affairs for unified management, and all proceeds will be turned over to the national treasury. The Ministry of Light Industry has been ordered to conduct a thorough self-examination of the relevant issues. This decision is completely correct.

This incident tells us that it is extremely important for all cadres, especially leaders at all levels, to strengthen their sense of hard work and self-denial and to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance. The reason why the relevant leaders of the Ministry of Light Industry made the mistake of pursuing luxury and wasting resources during the construction of the office building is that they forgot the fine tradition of hard work and self-denial in the new situation. Currently, China is still in the primary stage of socialism, and the level of productive forces and the material living standards of the people are still quite low. In such a national context, building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires hard work, self-reliance, and thrift in all endeavors.

Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Hard work and self-denial are our tradition. We must strengthen education in hard work and self-denial for the next 60 to 70 years. The more our country develops, the more we must emphasize hard work and self-reliance." Hard work and self-denial are not only a requirement for the broad masses of the people but, more importantly, a requirement for leaders at all levels. The Politburo of the Communist Party of China recently discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Several Urgent Matters of Concern to the People," which not only demonstrates the Party Central Committee and the State Council's firm resolve to improve government integrity but also sets an example for leaders at all levels to serve the people with integrity and self-denial.

All levels of party and government agencies, especially the central agencies, must take the lead in setting an example, leading in integrity and self-denial, and leading in not engaging in extravagance and waste. They must resolutely oppose the wind of extravagance and waste. They must learn from the mistakes made by the Ministry of Light Industry, seriously examine the problems of extravagance and waste in their own regions and units, and immediately take measures to address them. As long as party and government agencies do this seriously, they can form a trend of hard work and self-denial, thrift in building the country, and thrift in all endeavors among the entire society and the people, thereby accelerating the development of socialist modernization and ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening up.

    中央党政机关要带头艰苦奋斗
    新华社特约评论员
    对于轻工业部超标准、超概算、资金使用不当新建豪华办公楼的问题，国务院做出了严肃的处理决定，新办公楼交国务院机关事务管理局统一处理，所得收益全部上交国家财政，并责成轻工业部对有关问题作深刻检查。这个处理决定是完全正确的。
    这件事告诉我们，广大干部，尤其是各级领导干部，增强艰苦奋斗的观念，保持和发扬艰苦创业的优良传统，是极为重要的。轻工业部有关领导在建设办公楼过程中之所以犯追求豪华、铺张浪费的错误，就是因为他们在新形势下忘掉了艰苦奋斗的优良传统。目前，我国还处于社会主义的初级阶段，生产力发展水平以及人民的物质生活水平还相当低，在这样的国情下搞社会主义现代化建设，必须克勤克俭，艰苦创业，勤俭办一切事业。
    邓小平同志最近指出：“艰苦奋斗是我们的传统，艰苦朴素的教育今后要抓紧，一直要抓60至70年。我们的国家越发展，越要抓艰苦创业”。艰苦奋斗不只是对广大人民群众的要求，更重要的是对各级领导干部的要求，中共中央政治局在不久前讨论通过的《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》，既表明了党中央、国务院搞好廉政建设的坚定决心，也为各级领导干部廉洁奉公起了表率作用。
    我们的各级党政机关，尤其是中央机关必须率先垂范，带头廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗，带头不搞铺张浪费，不搞豪华设施，坚决反对奢侈浪费之风。要从轻工业部所犯错误中吸取教训，认真检查本地区、本单位存在的铺张浪费的问题，立即采取措施加以处理。只要党政机关认真这样做，就能够在全社会、全体人民中形成艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的风尚，从而加快社会主义现代化建设的发展，保证改革开放的顺利进行。
