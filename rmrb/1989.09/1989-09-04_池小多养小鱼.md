The economically impoverished county of Lushui in Yunnan has, in the past two years, introduced more than 180 ordinary technical workers and farmers with special skills from inland areas to help local residents improve their technical skills and develop commodity production. With relatively little investment, the returns have been significant. They have vividly summarized their approach as: "Small ponds can raise small fish." This is indeed an experience worth learning from.

Some impoverished regions often complain that their "ponds" are too small, their economic strength is insufficient, and the cultural and technical levels of their people are too low, making it difficult to attract "big fish." Experts and professors only go to economically developed regions. It cannot be denied that these are largely facts, but there is no need to complain. First, "small ponds" are a historical legacy. Today, we must, through our hard work, transform these "small ponds" into "large ponds," making backward, impoverished regions prosperous. This will take time. Second, whether "big fish" can be attracted depends on how necessary it is. The economic construction of impoverished regions is just beginning, and some places are just starting to solve the problem of subsistence. There are certainly high-tech problems worthy of experts and professors, but not many. At this stage, if a large number of "big fish" are introduced, they may not be able to be "raised."

If "big fish" cannot be attracted, can more "small fish" be introduced? The experience of Lushui shows that this is entirely possible. Take, for example, this county's use of fallow fields to plant winter vegetables. Last year, they introduced 12 farmers from inland areas to contract fallow fields, creating a record of 3,000 to 4,000 kilograms of watermelons per mu and nearly 5,000 kilograms of tomatoes. This has inspired more than a hundred households in the county to plant winter vegetables, with just Shangshu Township planting more than 1,000 mu. The logic is simple: introducing technical workers and farmers with certain skills, whose salary demands are not high, is economically feasible for the local area. They promote practical technologies that local farmers can easily accept and see immediate results. Although the "pond" is small, "fish" can still be introduced and "raised." Unfortunately, some comrades look down on "small fish," believing that "small fish" cannot create big waves.

Small ponds can raise small fish, and one should do as much as one can. This is in line with the principle of seeking truth from facts. To say that the comrades in impoverished regions do not understand their own capabilities is not in line with the facts. But indeed, some people, when doing things, always want to do big things quickly, hoping to "remove the poverty hat" as soon as possible. Sometimes, they force themselves to do things beyond their capabilities, even blindly pushing forward, often with results contrary to their wishes. Such lessons have been numerous in the past, and it is hoped that old problems will not recur.

    池小多养小鱼
    万兴
    经济贫困的云南泸水县，近两年先后从内地引进180多名普通技术工人和有专长的农民，帮助当地群众提高技术，发展商品生产；投资不多，收效不少。他们把自己的作法形象地概括为：池小多养小鱼。这确是一条值得借鉴的经验。
    一些贫困地区常抱怨自己“池子”小，经济实力不足，群众的文化技术水平太低，引不来“大鱼”，专家、教授只往经济发达地区跑。不可否认，这大都是事实，但大可不必抱怨。第一，“池小”是历史形成的，我们今天正要经过自己的辛勤劳动，使“小池”变为
  “大池”，让落后的贫困地区富裕起来，这要有一个过程。第二，能否引进“大鱼”，首先要看有多大必要。贫困地区的经济建设刚刚起步，一些地方甚至刚着手解决温饱问题，值得劳驾专家教授的高难技术问题肯定有，但不会很多。此时，定要引来成群的大鱼，恐怕确实“养”不住。
    引不来“大鱼”，能否多引点“小鱼”呢？泸水的经验证明这是完全可能的。就以这个县利用冬闲田种植冬季菜为例，前年他们引进内地12名菜农承包冬闲田，创造了亩产西瓜三四千公斤、西红柿近5000公斤的纪录，从而带动全县上百户农民种冬季蔬菜，仅上十二乡就种了1000多亩。道理很简单，引进了有一定专长的技术工人、农民，待遇要求不高，当地在经济上承受得起；他们推广的是一些实用技术，当地农民也容易接受，能立竿见影得到收获。“池”虽小，“鱼”也引来并“养”住了。遗憾的是，我们有些同志瞧不起“小鱼”，认定“小鱼”掀不起大浪。
    池小多养小鱼，有多大能耐干多大事情，这是符合实事求是道理的。要说贫困地区的同志完全不了解自己的能耐，那倒不符合事实。但确有些人干起事来总想大干快上，“早日摘掉贫困帽子”，有时力不从心也勉强去干，甚至盲目硬干，结果往往事与愿违。这样的教训，过去已经不少，但愿老病不要重犯。
