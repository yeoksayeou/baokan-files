The "Skyscraper" on Rails
– The Birth of the First Air-Conditioned Double-Decker Train

Reporter Gong Yongquan

Statistics show that during peak times, tens of thousands of people are standing on trains traveling north and south. The railway department has taken numerous measures to address this issue: increasing the number of trains, expanding the train composition, and raising the speed. Now, there is a new solution: double-decker trains. On August 30, China's first air-conditioned double-decker train officially began operation on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, increasing passenger capacity by 50% compared to ordinary trains.

When mentioning double-decker trains, people naturally ask: Is it stable to sit on the upper level? The fact is: it is even more stable than ordinary trains. Why is that? Chief Engineer Li Xiliang explained that the double-decker train is only 46 centimeters taller than an ordinary train. The main trick is that it extends downward towards the tracks, with the bottom of the car 25 centimeters above the tracks, nearly 1 meter lower than an ordinary train. Therefore, the train's center of gravity is lowered. Additionally, the use of new air suspension technology on the bogies ensures that during an emergency braking test at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour, a cup of tea filled to the brim did not spill a single drop.

The double-decker train has a light yellow body, with a wide orange decorative strip running horizontally between the upper and lower windows on both sides of the car. The arched roof has a silver-white heat-resistant coating that shines brightly. Stepping through the sliding doors, it feels like entering an airplane cabin. Light yellow single-seat high-back chairs are arranged in pairs along both sides, with purple-red plastic flooring. A green carpet runs down the center aisle, and two fluorescent light strips on the ceiling make the scene pleasing to the eye. The stairs between the upper and lower levels are open. The car ends are equipped with toilet occupancy indicators, allowing passengers to know if the toilet is in use from their seats.

It is reported that during the development of the air-conditioned double-decker train, scientists and engineers boldly innovated, drawing on domestic and international experiences, and adopting more than 20 new technologies and a large number of new materials. Some of the main performance indicators have reached or are close to the world's advanced level.

China is one of the earliest countries in Asia to develop double-decker trains. In the early 1960s, the Fourth Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory produced a double-decker train (without air conditioning), with a total capacity of 1048 people. It served for over 20 years and was retired in 1982.

The air-conditioned double-decker train is a national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key scientific and technological project. After bidding, the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory won the bid in November 1985. Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory is an old factory with over 80 years of history. To ensure the early birth of the new generation of double-decker trains, the entire factory mobilized. Chief Engineer Shen Hong, responsible for the overall design, did not rest for a single weekend after receiving the task, with sets of design drawings at both the factory and home; technician Zhang Shuwai took on the design of four major parts, a workload normally requiring four people; foreman Zhang Jiuyou organized a competition on the planer, doubling work efficiency; veteran worker Cai Genchang, relying on his rich experience, changed the aluminum extrusion process from molding to flat pressing, saving time; young worker Li Xifeng, instead of taking a honeymoon after his wedding, sometimes stayed at the factory when working late, with his new wife bringing him meals to the workshop... Factory director Song Zuoyue said: "Through the research on double-decker trains, a batch of engineering and technical personnel have been trained and cultivated, and the technical level of workers has been improved."

The three-year struggle was extraordinary. Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory produced the first double-decker hard-seat car in July 1987, successfully test-run on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and later developed soft-seat cars and power cars. The current first air-conditioned double-decker train consists of 10 hard-seat cars, 1 soft-seat car, and 1 power car, with a total capacity of 1970 people. A passenger wrote on the feedback form: "I truly hope to ride this train again."

May there be more air-conditioned double-decker trains running across the motherland!

　　奔驰的“楼房”
    ——第一列空调双层客车诞生记
    本报记者　龚永泉
    据统计，高峰时，在南来北往的铁路线上，竟有十几万人站着乘车。铁路部门为此采取了一个又一个措施：增开车次，扩大编组，提高车速。现在又多了一条新途径：双层客车。8月30日，我国第一列空调双层客车正式在沪宁线上投入运营，载客能力比普通列车提高50％。
    提到双层客车，人们很自然地会问：坐在上层平稳吗？事实的回答是：比普通客车还稳。什么缘故？总工程师李锡良介绍，双层客车外观仅比普通客车高出46厘米，主要奥妙是向轨面进行了延伸，车底距轨面高度为25厘米，比普通客车下移了近1米，因此，列车重心降低了。再加上转向架上使用了空气弹簧新技术，进行时速120公里的紧急制动试验时，倒满一杯开水的茶杯，水居然一滴也没有溅出来。
    双层客车车身呈淡黄色，上下层车窗之间，一条宽宽的桔红色装饰带横贯车身两侧，弧型车顶上银白色的防热涂层闪闪泛光。迈进拉式车门，宛如走进了飞机机舱。淡黄色的单人高靠椅呈二三配置，分列两厢，紫红色塑料铺地，中心通道一条墨绿色地毯，顶上两道荧光灯带，令人赏心悦目。上下层楼梯采用开敞式。车厢两端装有厕所显示灯，坐在位子上即可知道厕所有无人使用。
    据介绍，在空调双层客车研制中，科技人员大胆开拓，借鉴国内外经验，采用了20多项新技术和大量新材料，一些主要性能指标已达到或接近世界先进水平。
    我国是亚洲地区发展铁路双层客车最早的国家之一。1960年初，四方机车车辆厂试制了一列双层客车（无空调），全车定员1048人，服役20多年，于1982年退出运营。
    空调双层客车是国家“七五”科技攻关项目，经过投标，铁道部浦镇车辆厂于1985年11月一举中标。浦镇车辆厂是一个已有80多年历史的老厂。为了新一代双层客车的早日诞生，全厂上下都动起来了。负责总体设计的沈宏工程师自接受任务后，没有休息一个星期天，厂里、家里各放着一套设计图纸；技术员张淑薇担负了4大部分的设计，正常情况下这可是4个人的工作量；工长张久友组织牛头刨床开展双手赛，工效提高一倍多；老工人蔡根章凭丰富的经验把铝型材由模压改为平压，赢得了时间；青工李习文新婚后不度蜜月，有时干晚了干脆住在厂里，新娘就将饭菜送到车间……厂长宋组岳说：“通过双层客车的研究，锻炼和培养了一批工程技术人员，提高了工人的技术素养。”
    三年拚搏不寻常。浦镇车辆厂于1987年7月造出了第一辆双层硬座车，在京沪线上试车成功，以后又研制出软座车、发电车。目前的第一列空调双层客车由10辆硬座车、1辆软座车和1辆发电车组成，全列车定员1970人。一位旅客在征询意见表上写道：“真希望下次再乘这趟车。”
    愿有多一些的空调双层客车奔驰在祖国大地！
