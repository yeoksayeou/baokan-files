Since April 12, 1961, when Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin carried "tube food" into space, scientists have been researching and developing "space food," and this effort continues to this day.

At the end of 1968, people on Earth were amazed to see through their television screens that the "Apollo 8" spacecraft in the vast expanse of space had a table laden with a feast of Christmas dishes. This marked the end of the eight-year era of astronauts eating tube food. After the United States implemented the "Space Laboratory" plan, astronauts were able to use the ovens equipped in the spacecraft. They opened the neatly arranged food in aluminum cans, added water, and heated it, just like eating at home.

According to regulations, astronauts need to consume 3,000 calories of food per day, with particular attention to the balance of nutrients such as proteins and vitamins. Currently, countries like the United States and Japan have developed a series of space foods, with about 70 types of food and 20 types of beverages. The menu designed by the U.S. space agency has a six-day cycle, with each day's three meals carefully prepared and thoughtfully paired.

However, astronauts are not satisfied with these convenient and delicious space foods; their tastes seem to be becoming more discerning. In 1985, a French astronaut on the "Discovery" space shuttle complained, "I'm getting tired of the food provided by the U.S. space agency. It's time to switch to French cuisine!" This Frenchman vowed to usher in a new era for space food. Soon after returning to his country, he achieved his goal. He collaborated with a French space physiologist to establish the first French-style space food development company. Today, the French-style space food produced by this company has entered space and general households.

    美味佳肴上太空
    从一九六一年四月十二日苏联宇航员加加林携带“管装食品”升入太空之时起，科学家即对“宇宙食品”进行研制开发，至今方兴未艾。
    一九六八年岁暮，地球上的人们通过电视屏幕惊奇地发现，渺渺太空中“阿波罗八”号宇宙飞船仓内的餐桌上竟摆满了丰盛的圣诞食品。这标志着宇航员从此结束了八年之久的食用管装食品的历史。美国实施“宇宙实验室”计划后，宇航员第一次用上了航天器仓内装备的烤炉，他们打开铝罐内排列有序的食品，用水加热，如同在家里吃饭一样。
    按规定，宇航员一日三餐需要摄入三千卡热量的食物，尤其要考虑到食物中蛋白质、维生素等营养素的配比。目前美国、日本等国家宇宙食品的开发已形成系列产品，食品已达七十种，饮料二十种。美国宇航局制订的菜谱每六天为一个周期，每日三餐制作精细，搭配讲究。
    对于这些方便可口的宇宙食品，宇航员们并不满足，他们的胃口似乎越来越“挑剔”。一九八五年，“发现”号航天飞机上的一位法国宇航员曾经抱怨说：“美国宇航局提供的食品我都快吃腻了，该换换法国口味的啦！”这位法国人发誓要开创宇宙食品革命的新纪元。回国后不久，他终于如愿以偿。他与法国一位宇宙生理学者合作，创办了第一家法国风味的宇宙食品开发公司。如今，该公司推出的法式宇宙食品已打入太空，并进入一般家庭。
