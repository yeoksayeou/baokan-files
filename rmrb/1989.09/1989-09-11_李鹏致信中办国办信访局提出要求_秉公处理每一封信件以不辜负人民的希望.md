Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th.

Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, wrote a letter on September 10th to Zheng Youmei, Director of the Central Office and State Council Office's Letters and Visits Bureau, and Wang Gang, Deputy Director, requesting that "every letter be handled fairly to not disappoint the people's hopes."

The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Zheng Youmei, Wang Gang, and comrades of the Central Office and State Council Office's Letters and Visits Bureau:

Recently, Xiao Weiguo from Nandou County, Sichuan Province, wrote to me, pointing out that our implementation of the family planning policy has not been effective enough, and the population growth has exceeded the expected plan. His opinion is correct. Whether the rapid population growth can be effectively controlled is a fundamental issue that affects economic development, improvement of people's livelihood, enhancement of national quality, and the prosperity of the country. Implementing family planning is a basic state policy of ours. I have forwarded Xiao Weiguo's letter to the State Family Planning Commission, asking them to study it seriously, especially to supervise local governments in implementing the various measures proposed at this year's national family planning conference. They should regularly publish the population natural growth rate indicators of various places to allow for the supervision of the people and public opinion nationwide. I have also received a letter from Xiao Min from Huainan City, who pointed out that the public security situation in some areas is not good, with criminals committing violence and robbery without being effectively suppressed, causing the common people to live in fear. I have instructed the Ministry of Public Security to study and handle this. He also made some good suggestions regarding the anti-corruption efforts of the central and local governments, and the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by cadres.

Recently, people from various places have been writing to the central and state leaders, expressing various opinions. Some propose hopes and suggestions; some make appeals and request solutions to specific problems; some report cases, and many also provide criticisms and supervisory opinions. Many letters are addressed to Comrade Jiang Zemin and me. We are both very pleased about this. Letters from the people are a manifestation of their trust in the Party and the government and are an important channel for them to express their opinions to the leadership. Highly valuing and seriously handling people's letters is a responsibility of the leadership and an important link in maintaining close ties with the masses.

For these letters, we cannot read them all one by one, but can only selectively read some of them. However, as the specialized agency of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for handling people's letters and visits, we require you to carefully review and fairly handle every letter, so as not to disappoint the people's hopes.

Li Peng

　　李鹏致信中办国办信访局提出要求
　　秉公处理每一封信件  以不辜负人民的希望
    新华社北京9月11日电　国务院总理李鹏9月10日写信给中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅信访局局长郑幼枚、常务副局长王刚等同志，提出“秉公处理每一封信件，以不辜负人民的希望”。这封信全文如下：中办国办信访局郑幼枚、王刚等同志：
    最近，四川省南部县肖卫国同志给我来信，反映我们执行计划生育政策不够得力，人口增长仍然超过预期的设想。他的意见是正确的。人口过快增长能否得到有效控制，是关系到经济能否发展，人民生活能否改善，民族素质能否提高，国家能否兴旺发达的根本大计。实行计划生育是我国的一项基本国策。我已把肖卫国同志的信转到国家计划生育委员会，请他们认真研究，特别要督促各地政府，认真执行今年全国计划生育会议提出的各项措施，定期公布各地人口自然增长率指标完成情况，以便得到全国人民和舆论的监督。我还收到淮南市肖民同志的来信，反映有些地区治安情况不好，歹徒行凶、抢劫，得不到有力地打击，老百姓提心吊胆。我已责成公安部研究处理。他还就中央和地方的廉政建设，组织干部学习马列主义、毛泽东思想等问题，提出了一些好的建议。
    近来，各地群众纷纷给党中央和国务院负责同志来信，反映各种意见。有的提出希望和建议；有的是提出申诉和要求解决具体问题；有的是举报案件的，也有不少是提出批评和监督意见的。有许多信件是写给江泽民同志和我本人的，对此江泽民同志和我都感到十分高兴。人民来信，是人民对党和政府信任的表现，是他们向领导机关反映意见的重要渠道。高度重视和认真处理人民来信，是领导机关应尽的责任，是密切联系群众的重要环节。
    对这些来信，我们不能全部一一过目，只能有选择地看一部分。但是，作为党中央和国务院处理人民来信来访的专门机构，要求你们认真查阅，秉公处理每一封信件，以不辜负人民的希望。
                                                李　鹏
