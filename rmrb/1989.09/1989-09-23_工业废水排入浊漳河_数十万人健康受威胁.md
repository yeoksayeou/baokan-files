The Shanxi Fertilizer Plant has been discharging 1.7 million tons of wastewater into the Zhuo River daily since it began trial production in July 1987. Due to poor management, inadequate environmental protection facilities, and abnormal production, there have been multiple pollution incidents. Currently, the harmful substances in the wastewater discharged by this plant far exceed the original design standards, as well as the national comprehensive wastewater discharge standards and irrigation requirements for farmland. This has resulted in severe pollution of the Zhuo River and groundwater along its banks. Over 30,000 people in five townships of Pingshun County have been affected, and the polluted Zhuo River is also threatening the health of over 500,000 people living along its banks.

    工业废水排入浊漳河
    数十万人健康受威胁
    山西化肥厂自1987年7月试生产以来，每天将1.7万吨废水排入浊漳河。由于管理不善，环保设施不配套和生产不正常等原因，多次发生污染事故。现在这家工厂排放的废水中，有害物质大大超过了原设计标准，也超过了国家污水综合排放标准和农田灌溉要求，造成浊漳河和沿河的地下水严重污染，平顺县5个乡镇的3万多人受害，污染的浊漳河同时威胁着沿河50多万人的身体健康。
