We Are the Masters of the Country

It seems like it was just yesterday, but it has already been 10 years. We four wrote a letter titled "We Hope for the Implementation of the Production Responsibility System Tied to Output" which was first published on the front page of the Anhui Daily on December 12, 1979. Six days later, it was reprinted on the front page of the People's Daily.

Who would have believed that we, who spend our days dealing with crops and clods of earth, could have our article published on the front page of the Party's central organ!

For those few days, that issue of the People's Daily was passed around among us, read over and over again. Wave after wave of excitement, laughter after laughter. We, these "mud-legged" farmers, felt a sense of pride as masters of the country.

We few villagers, except for Wang Wenxiang who is nearing sixty, the rest of us were all born in the same year as the Republic. Generation after generation of villagers, how many have we heard of who write articles or discuss state affairs! How did we come to think of writing for the Party newspaper? Well, it was because we had so much to say.

Ten years ago, just after the dreadful "Cultural Revolution" had ended, the lives of us farmers were still "with sweet potatoes as the main food, and old hens as the savings bank." Life was much harder than it is now. A good laborer working a whole day would only earn four or five jiao, and most farmers lived in thatched houses.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee blew in. In 1979, the agricultural production responsibility system tied to output spread like wildfire, and our hearts were ignited as well. Everyone discussed it eagerly, yes, with this method, farmers could indeed create a life of plenty with their own hands. Just like the example we gave in our article, the production team's method of "big pot" farming, that year 20 mu of peanuts only yielded over 500 jin, while a mu of personal plot yielded 100-200 jin. If we changed the "big pot" method, the collective land could also be farmed with the same effort as the personal plot.

But no matter how much we hoped, at that time there was no sign of the responsibility system in Dangshan County. We asked the team leaders to implement the responsibility system, but the team leaders were always unwilling to follow our wishes. We were so impatient that we couldn't wait any longer, so the four of us spent two whole nights, each contributing a sentence, and wrote this article, expressing our thoughts. We said: "We all hope that the country can quickly become prosperous, and the people can live a wealthy life. Currently, in the countryside, implementing the agricultural production responsibility system tied to output is a good way to develop production, and we urgently request to adopt this method." This article, carrying our intentions and cries, flew to the provincial capital of Hefei, and later to Beijing, and to the whole country!

At that time, there were also some people, including some cadres, who did not understand our actions and said many unkind words, such as "chasing trends" and "earning article fees" ... Hearing this really made us angry. But we thought, we are the masters of the country, and we should say what we need to say to the Party and the country, fearlessly! We four are all from poor peasant families. In the old society, how miserable the peasants were, the elder Wang Wenxiang still often tells everyone. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we would all still be beggars, how could we have today! We have no second thoughts about the Party or the country. Take Wang Wenxiang for example, in 1954, he was the first to sign up to join the agricultural production cooperative in this area. During the three years of natural disasters, we went hungry, but we had no complaints on our lips. Because we are the masters of the country, being a master means acting like a master! So, no matter what idle talk people say, we are at ease in our hearts.

Our appeal has been tested by time and proven to be in line with the Party's and the people's hearts. Soon, the agricultural contract responsibility system was promoted in Dangshan as well. Our wish finally came true. Ten years have passed, and some people still say to us: "It was you four who had the foresight!" Look, in these ten years, we have truly risen step by step! Now, life may not be perfect, but "eating fine grains all year round, living in brick houses, and having savings in the bank" is indeed a fact. Dangshan is famous nationwide for its Dangshan pear. In recent years, we have responded to the county's call, while ensuring grain production, we have planted a lot of pears and apples on the sandbars of the Yellow River's old course. Just wait and see, in another four or five years, our hometown will become a real orchard, and our lives will be even more prosperous.

Thinking about these 40 years, thinking about these 10 years, we truly feel from the bottom of our hearts that the farmers have become the masters of the country, all thanks to the good socialist system and the good leadership of the Party! Not long ago, during the turmoil, some people actually wanted to oppose the Communist Party and the socialist road, which is something we absolutely cannot agree to, and something that hundreds of millions of farmers absolutely cannot agree to.

    我们是国家主人
    安徽省砀山县官庄坝镇张老家村　张世居　王文香　刘福印　魏正德
    一晃眼，已是10年前的事了。我们4个联名写的信《我们盼望实行联系产量的生产责任制》，先是发表在1979年12月12日的安徽日报头版，6天后又转载到人民日报头版上。
    谁能信，我们这些整天与庄稼棵子、土坷垃打交道的农民，写了稿也能登上党中央机关报的头版！
    那几天，那张人民日报在我们手里传过来传过去，看一遍又一遍。一阵阵兴奋，一阵阵欢笑。我们这些“泥腿子”，心里充满了主人翁的自豪感。
    我们这几个庄户人，除了王文香年近花甲外，其余3人都与共和国同年诞生。祖祖辈辈庄户人，听说过几个写文章、论国事的！我们怎么会想起给党报写稿的呢？说起来，这也是叫一肚子话给憋的。
    10年前，那场可怕的“文化大革命”刚刚结束时，咱农民的日子还是“红芋片子作主粮，老母鸡当小银行”，比现在苦多了。一个好劳力辛辛苦苦干一天，也就值四五角钱，农民住的，大部分是草房。
    党的十一届三中全会的春风吹来了。1979年，联系产量的农业生产责任制像星星之火一样点着了，我们的心也跟着点着了。大家七嘴八舌议论着，对呀，用这个法子，农民准能用自己的双手，创造出丰衣足食的美好生活。就像我们在稿中举的那个例子，生产队“大呼隆”的干法，那年种20亩花生才打500多公斤，社员自留地一亩就打一二百公斤。改了“大呼隆”，集体的地也能像自留地那样下功夫种好。
    可是，盼来盼去当时砀山县就是没有责任制的影子。我们要求队干部实行责任制，队干部总是不愿意顺着我们的心意干。我们急得实在等不下去了，于是4个人整整花了两个通宵，你一言、我一语地写成了这篇稿，说说我们的心里话。我们说：“我们都希望国家能够很快富强起来，群众能够过上富裕的生活。当前，在农村，实行联系产量的生产责任制，是发展生产的好办法，我们迫切地要求采用这种办法。”这篇文章带着我们的心意与呐喊，飞向省城合肥，后来又飞向北京，飞向全国！
    当初，也有一些人，包括一些干部，对我们的举动很不理解，说了不少风凉话，什么“赶风头”呀，“捞稿费”呀……听了真叫人生气。可是我们想，我们是国家的主人，该向党和国家说的话，就得理直气壮地说，怕啥！我们4人全是贫农出身。旧社会农民如何如何苦，年长的王文香至今还常常讲给大伙听。如果不是共产党、毛主席，我们一个个还不都是讨饭的料，哪有今天！我们这些人对党、对国家没有二心。拿王文香来说，1954年在这一带他是第一个报名参加农业生产合作社的。3年自然灾害困难时期，我们饿过肚子，嘴上也没有一点怨言。因为我们是国家的主人呀，当主人就要有个主人样子嘛！就这么着，不管人家说啥闲话，我们心里踏踏实实。
    我们的呼吁经过时间的考验，证明是符合党心、民心的。很快，农业联产承包责任制在砀山也推广开了。我们的心愿终于实现了。10年过去了，还有人对我们说：“还是你们4个有眼光！”这不，10年来我们可真是一步一层天！现在生活虽说不上好到头了，但“常年吃细粮，住着砖瓦房，银行有存款”却是千真万确的事实。砀山是全国闻名的砀山酥梨产地。这几年，我们响应县里的号召，在保证粮食生产的同时，利用黄河故道沙滩，种了不少梨、苹果什么的。瞧着吧，再过个四五年，家乡成为名副其实的花果园，我们的日子就更红火了。
    想想这40年，想想这10年，我们打心眼儿里感到，庄稼汉成了国家主人，全仗着社会主义制度好，仗着党的领导好！前不久发生动乱时，一些人竟然要反对共产党，反对社会主义道路，这是我们绝对不能答应的，也是亿万农民绝对不能答应的。
