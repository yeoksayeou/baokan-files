Foreign Ministry Spokesman Reiterates China's Stance on Comprehensive Ban on Chemical Weapons

    BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman Li Zhaoxing of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said today that the United States and the Soviet Union, as the two countries possessing the largest chemical weapon arsenals, should bear special responsibility for the prohibition of chemical weapons.

    He made the remarks in reply to a question from a reporter who asked for China's comment on President Bush's proposal for a three-stage reduction and destruction of chemical weapons.

    Li said that China has consistently advocated a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of chemical weapons, hoping that an international convention for the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons will be concluded as early as possible and that China will actively participate in the relevant negotiations.

    Li Zhaoxing said that China has taken note of the proposals made by the U.S. President and the Soviet Foreign Minister. He said that China hopes they will take concrete actions to fulfill their special responsibilities.
