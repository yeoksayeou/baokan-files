To the People's Governments of Shandong Province and Qingdao City, the China National Petroleum Corporation, and all personnel who participated in the firefighting and rescue efforts at the Yellow Island Oil Depot:

At the critical moment when the Yellow Island Oil Depot faced a major fire disaster, threatening state property and the safety of people's lives, you resolutely carried out the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Under the unified leadership and meticulous organization and command of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and the China National Petroleum Corporation, you fearlessly threw yourselves into the firefighting and rescue battle. After more than 100 hours of heroic struggle, you completely extinguished the fire, achieving a significant victory in the firefighting and rescue efforts. The State Council extends its warm congratulations to you! We express our profound respect to the comrades who were injured in the firefighting and rescue efforts! We express our deep sorrow for the comrades who sacrificed their lives! We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and injured comrades!

In the face of this major fire disaster, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government organized the entire province's party, government, military, and civilian forces to actively support the frontline of firefighting, with the public security departments promptly transporting firefighting materials, providing strong guarantees for the firefighting and rescue efforts. The Qingdao Municipal Party and government leadership spared no effort, made decisive decisions, and meticulously deployed, personally commanding the scene to ensure that the firefighting battle proceeded in an orderly and tense manner. The broad masses of armed police, firefighters, and medical personnel fearlessly rushed into the fire, showing an overwhelming heroic spirit and loyalty to the country and the people. The People's Liberation Army quickly mobilized and joined the firefighting and rescue efforts, establishing an immortal merit. The workers of the Yellow Island Oil Depot stood firm at their posts, fought tenaciously, and also made important contributions.

Your heroic deeds and glorious achievements in the firefighting and rescue battle fully demonstrated the heroic character of the working class and the people's soldiers, worthy of learning by the broad masses of the people. We hope that under the unified organization and deployment of the People's Governments of Shandong Province and Qingdao City and the China National Petroleum Corporation, you will conscientiously do a good job in all post-disaster work, seriously summarize the experience and lessons, improve the management and technical equipment of oil transportation, enhance the ability to resist various disasters, ensure safe production, and make new contributions to the cause of socialist construction.
