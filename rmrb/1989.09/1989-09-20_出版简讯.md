Jiangxi People's Publishing House recently published the "Revolutionary Historical Materials" series. The series consists of twenty-five volumes in thirty-two books, totaling over fourteen million words. It meticulously records materials related to the revolutionary bases established in Jiangxi and its border regions during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. The series faithfully documents the great achievements of the Communist Party of China and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, including Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping.

The "Revolutionary Historical Materials" series is divided into three main categories: historical documents, reminiscences, and historical essays. The historical documents category compiles original documents and materials issued by various departments of the party, government, and military in the Soviet areas at that time. These materials are printed based on the revolutionary historical archives preserved by the Jiangxi Provincial Archives, which have never been published before. The reminiscences category includes articles and memoirs from several hundred senior comrades such as Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, Xiao Ke, and Wang Shoudao. The historical essays category features research insights from specialists on related topics, reflecting the latest research findings in the country. The "Revolutionary Historical Materials" series is comprehensive and detailed, providing valuable reference materials for the study of Chinese revolutionary history and modern Chinese history.

The long-form reportage "Panmunjom Negotiations" by Cai Chengwen and Zhao Yongtian has been published by the People's Liberation Army Press. This book recounts the entire course of the Korean War, including the pre-war situation, the causes of the war, the coordination between the battlefield and the negotiation venue, and the changes in the Far East situation after the signing of the armistice. It reveals many little-known historical materials.

Hu Zifeng's "Artistic Voyage—My Artistic Journey" has been published by Shanghai Xuelin Publishing House. The book records the author's journey from a university student to becoming a disciple of the great artist Mei Lanfang, and his relentless pursuit and arduous exploration in the world of art. It also documents the profound insights and moral guidance that Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfan, two great masters of Chinese opera, provided to the author in both art and character.
