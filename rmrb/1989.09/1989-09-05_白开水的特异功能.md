It is said that humanity has now entered the "space age," where every aspect of life—eating, dressing, living, and traveling—must be innovated, or else one will be left behind. Our country has also been influenced by this trend. Take beverages, for example: foreign brands like Coca-Cola, fruit juices, Nestlé coffee, and Maxwell House coffee are heavily advertised on TV and in streets. Domestic brands like Qiangli, Aolun, and Moqi beverages are also not falling behind. Various canned, soft-packaged, and large plastic-bottled fruit juices, sodas, and powdered drinks flood the market, some at quite high prices, yet there are still many who seek them out. Drinking high-end beverages has become a trend in the "space age." However, according to research by scientists both domestic and foreign, plain boiled water at a temperature of 20 to 25 degrees Celsius has many unique benefits that high-end beverages cannot match. American physiologist Dr. John discovered that warm plain boiled water is more easily absorbed through cell membranes, promotes metabolism, increases the hemoglobin content in the blood, and improves the body's immune function. Those who habitually drink warm plain boiled water have higher dehydrogenase activity in their bodies, which helps to quickly eliminate lactic acid buildup in muscles, making people less prone to fatigue. This is beneficial for athletes, manual laborers, and the general public. On the other hand, fruit juices, sodas, and various powdered drinks often contain a lot of sugar, saccharin, electrolytes, and synthetic colors, which can affect digestion and absorption. (See the August 3, 1988, issue of *China Sports News*, page 3)

Learning these scientific facts, I suddenly felt enlightened. It seems that some trendy things may not have as much practical effect as they are claimed to have. Plain boiled water is the most ordinary, convenient, and inexpensive beverage. Because it is too common and familiar, it is often overlooked. Who would have thought that it has many unique physiological activities that trendy high-end beverages cannot replace? This is truly an eye-opener.

I do not intend to belittle the effectiveness of high-end beverages. Those who have the means can certainly enjoy them. However, the wide-ranging benefits of plain boiled water should not be overlooked or despised.

Furthermore, I think about how many ordinary things in life are often overlooked or discarded, but they actually have irreplaceable special functions that should not be easily forgotten. For example, the guiding role of Marxist theory, the necessity of the Communist Party's leadership, and the inevitable law of socialism replacing capitalism, seem like old clichés. Compared to the dazzling array of new ideas and theories, they seem as ordinary as plain boiled water. But they are ordinary yet great truths. However, under the strong promotion and advocacy of new trend scholars and experts, it seems that only their "space-age theories" can save China. Marxism is outdated, unpopular, and useless. Again, in recent years, ideological and political work has been devalued to the point of being worthless. It seems that as long as we have the influx of Western bourgeois new trend theoretical works and the sexually explicit literature sold on street stalls, we can guide our masses and youth to become the elite and pillars of the new era. Is this really the case? It is worth our deep consideration.

Recently, I saw a special report on TV about the Harbin Boiler Factory. The workers of this factory have withstood various trials over the years and have maintained a stable and vigorous production enthusiasm, completing the national tasks assigned to them year after year despite difficult conditions. Why? The answer obtained from the reporter's interview was quite simple. The factory's leadership did not use any new trend theories or fashionable methods to manage the factory. Their successful experience is basically the old routine: strengthening ideological and political work, fully mobilizing the sense of ownership among the workers and engineering and technical personnel; correctly formulating and strictly implementing various rules and regulations, with clear rewards and punishments. The most important point is that the factory director and party secretary always set an example, govern cleanly, do not seek special privileges, do not act arbitrarily, and always set an example in everything. This experience, though not surprising, has been proven by practice to be in line with China's national conditions, public sentiment, and factory conditions, and has socialist "unique physiological activities." It is understandable that it can continue to be effective today.

The times are advancing, and we cannot stick to old ways of thinking. We must continuously innovate and break new ground. This is undeniable. To adhere to reform and opening up, we must be good at learning and drawing on advanced science and technology, management methods, and even progressive and valuable theories from abroad. Otherwise, we will stagnate and even fall behind.

However, we should not overlook or discard successful experiences that have been proven effective by practice and created by ourselves. Just as when drinking high-end beverages, we must not forget the most unassuming plain boiled water, because it contains "space-age beverage" irreplaceable unique physiological activities.

    白开水的特异功能
    成志伟
    据说，现在人类已进入了“太空时代”，吃穿住行都要来个革新，不然就要落伍。我国也颇受了这种思潮的影响。以饮料而论，外国的可口可乐、果珍、雀巢咖啡、麦氏咖啡之类，在我国电视和街头大做广告，国产的健力宝、强力、奥林、摩奇饮料，也不甘落后。各种易拉罐、软包装、大塑料瓶的果汁、汽水和冲剂饮料充斥市场，有的价格相当昂贵，问津者却不乏其人。饮用高级饮料，成了“太空时代”的一种时髦。不过，据中外一些科学家研究证明，温度20至25摄氏度的新鲜白开水，却具有许多高级饮料无法比拟的特殊功效。美国生理学博士约翰研究发现，温和的白开水比较容易透过细胞膜，促进新陈代谢，增加血液中血红蛋白的含量，有利于改善人体的免疫功能。习惯于喝温白开水的人，体内脱氢酶活性较高，消除肌肉中的乳酸积累较快，使人不易疲劳，对运动员、体力劳动者和一般人来说，都十分有益。而果汁、汽水及各种冲剂饮料，大都含有较多白糖、糖精、电解质及合成色素，会影响消化吸收功能。（见1988年8月3日《中国体育报》第三版）
    了解了这些科学知识，不觉使我眼前一亮。看来，有一些时髦的东西，未必都有那么大的实际功效。白开水，是一种最普通、最方便、最廉价的饮料，正因为它太平凡而常见，反倒被人们忽视，想不到它还有许多风行的高级饮料无法代替的特异生理活性，真教人茅塞顿开。
    我无意于贬低高级饮料的作用，有条件的人尽可以去饮用享受。但白开水更具有广泛的良好疗效，却不应被轻视和鄙薄。
    进而我想到，许多生活中常见的平凡的事物，往往被人们忽视甚至丢弃，其实，它们常常具有不可被代替的特殊作用，是不应该被轻易忘却的。例如，马克思主义理论的指导作用，共产党领导的必要性，社会主义代替资本主义的必然规律等等，似乎是老生常谈，与眼花缭乱的新思维、新理论相比，像白开水那样普通，但它们是平凡而伟大的真理。可是，在新潮派学者专家的大力宣扬鼓吹下，似乎只有他们的“太空理论”才能救中国，马克思主义已经过时了，不吃香了，没有用了。再如，这几年思想政治工作被贬损得一钱不值，似乎只要靠蜂拥而来的西方资产阶级新潮理论著作，加上街头书摊上大肆兜售的“性”文学读本，就可以引导我们的大众与青少年，成为新时代的精英和栋梁。果真如此？值得我们深长思之。
    最近，从电视上看到哈尔滨锅炉厂的一个专题报道。该厂工人这些年来经受住了社会上各种风浪的考验，一直保持着稳定而旺盛的生产热情，在困难的条件下年年完成国家下达的任务。原因何在？记者采访中得到的回答却非常简单。该厂领导并没有采用什么新潮理论与时髦方法来治厂。他们的成功经验基本上还是“老一套”：加强思想政治工作，充分发挥广大工人与工程技术人员当家作主的主人翁精神；正确制定并严格执行各项规章制度，奖惩分明。最重要的一条，则是厂长、党委书记时时以身作则，为政清廉，不特殊，不专断，处处起表率作用。这经验虽不惊人，却是早已被实践证明是符合中国的国情、民情和厂情的，具有社会主义的“特异生理活性”，在今天能够继续频频奏效，乃在情理之中，完全可以理解。
    时代在前进，我们不能固守老一套的思维模式，要不断开拓创新，这毫无疑问。坚持改革开放，就要善于学习借鉴国外的先进科学技术、管理方法，乃至进步的有价值的思想理论，否则我们就会停滞不前，甚至倒退落后。
    但是，对于被实践证明行之有效的、我们自己所创造的成功经验，也不可轻视甚至抛弃。就像在喝高级饮料的同时，务必不要忘记最不起眼的白开水，因为它含有“太空饮料”不可取代的特异生理活性。
