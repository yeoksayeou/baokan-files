Perhaps no other country in the world has as many overseas Chinese writers as China. A Chinese-American writer once remarked with deep emotion: "Overseas writers are not unique to China, but China is the largest exporter. The number of Chinese writers who leave their homeland to settle abroad is unparalleled in the world." Currently, among the writers who have moved abroad, there are those who came from Hong Kong, those who came from the mainland, but more are from Taiwan. This certainly indicates that Chinese literature holds an indispensable place in the world of literature, and it also reminds us not to overlook the creative works of overseas Chinese literature that share the same cultural bloodline. Now, literature from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities has become a magnificent literary landscape.

Due to political and historical reasons, for decades, the mainland has had almost no introductions to literature from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese communities. After the downfall of the Gang of Four, with the opening up to the outside world and a series of policies, mainland readers have had the fortune to come into contact with a broader range of literature from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities. However, before 1984, there were numerous literary magazines, but none were dedicated to introducing literature from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities. In 1984, the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized and invited a group of renowned writers and scholars from the mainland, Hong Kong, and overseas to establish the first large-scale literary magazine in the mainland, "Four Seas – Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Overseas Chinese Literature." The magazine's name is inspired by the phrase "all under heaven are brothers." The establishment of "Four Seas" aims to develop world Chinese literature, introducing the creative achievements of literature from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities to domestic readers, and fostering exchanges and friendships between writers and readers from the mainland and Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas.

Since its inception in 1985, "Four Seas" has published ten issues, featuring works by 135 authors, totaling 187 pieces. Although these authors' works have been published in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or overseas, the majority are being introduced to domestic readers for the first time. Meanwhile, the "Four Seas" magazine editorial team has also edited and published the "Collection of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Overseas Chinese Literature." Through their edited magazines and published books, a large number of writers from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and overseas have had their works introduced to the mainland.

In just a few years, "Four Seas" has become the only large-scale periodical in the mainland dedicated to introducing literature from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas, and has had a significant impact both domestically and internationally. This is undoubtedly the result of the hard work of the small editorial team, as well as the fact that they have organized and invited a considerable number of renowned writers, artists, theorists, publishers, and professors from both domestic and international circles to serve as the magazine's editors, advisors, and editorial board members. Although their roles and titles may differ, they do not merely hold honorary positions without involvement in the work. Despite being scattered across different regions, they all regard "Four Seas" as their own endeavor, showing concern and support. Some of them provide strategic planning and advice; others contribute articles and essays; some coordinate with various parties to commission special articles; and others meticulously handle the layout and text. The "Four Seas" editorial team has always adhered to the correct publishing principles, maintaining a high standard, striving for serious editing thoughts, rigorous editing work, and strict selection of works. Over the years, many works published in "Four Seas" have been republished, reprinted, adapted, or filmed for television.

Although "Four Seas" has focused on introducing works by many renowned overseas writers, as the first large-scale magazine in the mainland dedicated to writers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas, they still take it upon themselves to nurture literary newcomers from various overseas regions, providing space and a platform for them.

As a creative magazine, "Four Seas" also places great importance on the exploration of theoretical issues, and has put a lot of thought into the design of its columns. This not only demonstrates the editors' attempt to guide overseas literary creation theoretically, but also reflects the editors' quality and wisdom.

In the current competitive landscape of domestic publishing of literature from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities, as a large-scale specialized periodical like "Four Seas," the editors should leverage their strengths. On one hand, they should more broadly select high-quality Chinese literature works from various countries and regions; on the other hand, they should strive to obtain new works that authors have never published before, to enhance their own reputation and attract more readers. Additionally, they should pay more attention to introducing modernist writers from Taiwan and overseas, making the magazine more vibrant and full of life.

　　敞向“四海”的文学窗口
　　——《四海——港台海外华文文学》评介
　　宁小龄
    也许世界上没有哪一个国家会像中国这样拥有大批的移居海外的华裔作家。一位美国华裔作家曾深有感触地叹道：“海外作家不是中国人的特产，但中国却是最大的出口地。中国作家离开本土而移居海外，数量之多，居世界之冠”。现在移居海外的作家中有从香港去的、也有从大陆去的，但更多的是台湾的。这固然可说明中国文学在世界文学之林中占有不可或缺的一席之地，同时也提醒我们不可忽视同一民族文化血脉的海外华文文学的创作。现在港台海外华文文学已成蔚为大观的文学景象。
    由于政治和历史的原因，几十年来大陆对于台湾香港澳门及海外华文文学的介绍近乎于零。粉碎四人帮后，随着对外开放等一系列政策，大陆读者有幸能接触到比较广泛的港澳台及海外的华文文学作品。然而在1984年以前文学刊物如林，但却没有一家专门的文学刊物来介绍港澳台及海外华文文学作品。1984年，中国文联出版公司组织邀请了大陆、香港、海外各国各地区的一批著名作家、学者，创办了国内第一家大型文学杂志《四海——港台海外华文文学》丛刊。刊物取“四海之内皆兄弟”之意。《四海》的创办是以发展世界华文文学为宗旨，目的是向国内读者介绍港澳台海外华文文学的创作成果，沟通大陆与港澳台海外的作家和读者之间的交流与友谊。
      《四海》自1985年创刊到现在，一共出版了十辑，发表了135位作家（作者）的187部（篇）作品，这些作家的作品尽管已在港台或海外发表过，但绝大多数还是第一次在国内与读者公开见面。与此同时，《四海》杂志社还编辑出版了《香港台湾与海外华文文学丛书》。他们编辑的刊物和出版的书籍中，港澳台与东南亚和海外的一大批作家的作品被介绍到国内。
      《四海》杂志社能在短短几年中，成为国内唯一专门介绍港澳台与海外文学的大型期刊，并在海内外产生一定的影响，这固然是人数不多的编辑部全体同仁共同辛勤耕耘的结果，同时，也同他们组织聘请了相当一批海内外知名作家、艺术家、理论家、出版家和教授来作为期刊的主编、顾问和编委是分不开的。他们虽任职挂衔不同，但绝不像一些刊物的所谓顾问、编委那样，是徒有虚名而“不问其政”。虽然他们天各一方，但彼此却把《四海》视为自己的事业来关心和支持。他们中或运筹帷幄、出谋划策；或身体力行，撰稿赐文；或联系八方，组约专稿；或版面文字、巨细皆问。同时《四海》编辑部历来坚持正确的办刊方针，保持较高格调，力求编辑思想严肃、编辑工作严谨，编选作品严格。几年来，在《四海》上发表的许多作品，先后被出书、转载、改编，或拍摄成电影、电视。
    尽管《四海》重点介绍过海外不少知名作家的作品，但作为国内第一家面向港台海外作家的大型杂志，他们仍以扶植海外各地区的文学新人为己任，辟出版面，提供园地。
      《四海》作为创作刊物也十分重视理论问题的探讨，在栏目的开设上也颇费苦心。这既显示了编者对海外文学创作力图在理论上以宏观的指导，同时也体现了编者的素质与智慧。
    在目前国内对港台海外华文文学出版蜂起的竞争格局中，作为《四海》这样大型的专门期刊，编者应发挥自己的强大优势，一方面应更加广泛地精选各国各地区的华文文学作品；另一方面还应争取到作家从未发表过的新作，以提高自身的名望，吸引更多的读者。另外，应注重对台湾及海外的现代派作家的介绍，使刊物办得更加色彩缤纷和生气勃勃。
