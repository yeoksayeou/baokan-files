Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th.

The Ministry of Light Industry has authorized the China Flavor and Fragrance Industry Association to announce that the "First China Cosmetics Expo" and its awarding activities are illegal, the award results are invalid, and the awarded medals are nullified.

Despite repeated orders from the State Council to strictly prohibit non-authorized departments from conducting awards and evaluations, some units still ignore these directives. From September 3rd to 5th this year, nine news organizations, including the _Zhongwai Qiye Jia_ magazine, the _Heilongjiang Daily_ supplement department, _Xinqingnian_ magazine, and _Shenghuo Bao_ newspaper, held the so-called "First China Cosmetics Expo" in Harbin City.

It is reported that this so-called expo was not approved by the relevant authorities and arbitrarily used the name "China." The expo also required participating enterprises to pay a 500 yuan registration fee and a 1,000 yuan exhibition fee per product. Only 34 enterprises participated in this expo, and most of the major factories among the more than 170 cosmetics enterprises nationwide did not participate. Among the 34 participating enterprises, 8 have yet to obtain production permits from relevant departments. The expo awarded 3 special prizes, 10 gold awards, and 12 silver awards. Among the award-winning product enterprises, 5 are unlicensed factories.

The person in charge of the China Flavor and Fragrance Industry Association said that before the expo, relevant officials from the Ministry of Light Industry and the State Technical Supervision Bureau had repeatedly called and telegraphed the organizers, asking them to immediately stop the activity and not to conduct any form of awarding. However, the organizers did not heed the advice and continued as before.

The State Technical Supervision Bureau, which is responsible for the national product quality evaluation work, has long stipulated that the evaluation work should be planned, approved, and awarded by the state; the specific selection work should be handled by various industry associations; the basis for selection should be the testing data provided by various industry quality testing institutions and user evaluations. The "First China Cosmetics Expo" held in Harbin City was neither approved by the state authorities nor agreed upon by the industry association, and it also lacked testing data from quality testing institutions and consumer evaluations.

Relevant personnel pointed out that the frequent illegal awarding activities in the economic field have disrupted the normal evaluation of high-quality products by the state and relevant departments, encouraged and tolerated the spread of counterfeit and substandard products, harmed consumers, and increased the burden on enterprises. It is harmful and must be strictly prohibited.

### 未经主管部门批准扰乱正常产品评比　中国化妆品博览会不合法　轻工部授权宣布评奖结果无效

　　未经主管部门批准扰乱正常产品评比
　　中国化妆品博览会不合法
　　轻工部授权宣布评奖结果无效
    新华社北京9月16日电　（记者杨理科）轻工业部授权中国香精香料化妆品工业协会今天宣布：“首届中国化妆品博览会”及其评奖活动是非法的，评奖结果无效，所得奖牌作废。
    尽管国务院三令五申，严禁非主管部门评奖评优，但仍有少数单位对此置若罔闻。今年9月3日到5日，《中外企业家》杂志社、《黑龙江日报》副刊部、《新青年》杂志社、《生活报》社等9家新闻单位，在哈尔滨市举办了所谓“首届中国化妆品博览会”。
    据介绍，这次所谓的博览会不仅未经主管部门批准，而且擅自使用“中国”的名称。“博览会”还要求参加企业交纳500元的报名费、每个产品交纳1000元的参展费。参加这次博览会的企业只有34家，全国170多家化妆品企业中的主要大厂基本上没有参加。在参加的34家企业中有8家至今尚未拿到有关部门的生产许可证。“博览会”评出特级奖3个、金奖10个、银奖12个。获奖产品的企业中竟有5家是无证厂。
    中国香化协会负责人说，“博览会”举办前，轻工业部和国家技术监督局的有关负责人曾几次打电话、打电报给主办者，要求他们立即停止这一活动，不得以任何形式进行评奖。但主办者不听劝告，仍然我行我素。
    主管我国产品质量评优工作的国家技术监督局早就明文规定：评优工作要由国家规划、审定、发奖；具体评选工作应由各行业协会负责；评选的依据是各行业质量检测机构提供的检测数据和用户评价。这次在哈尔滨市举办的“首届中国化妆品博览会”既未由国家主管部门批准，也未征得行业协会同意，更没有质量检测机构提供的检测数据和消费者评价。
    有关人士指出，经济领域不时发生的非法评奖活动，扰乱了国家及主管部门的正常优质产品评比，助长和纵容了伪劣产品的蔓延，坑害了消费者，增加了企业负担。有百害而无一利，必须严厉禁止。
