Currently, efforts to promote clean governance and combat corruption are underway across various regions. Our newspaper has received letters from readers in Anhui, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Fujian, and Hainan, providing insights into the rectification of the practice of using public funds for entertainment. Several noteworthy points can be observed from these letters.

Information One: Reduction in Entertainment Expenses
Some regions have taken early and firm action to address the issue of using public funds for entertainment, achieving noticeable results. Ai Qingjun and Su Changjiang from the Broadcast and Television Bureau of Shuncheng District in Liaoning's Fushun City wrote that since March, the Party Committee and government of Li Shi Zhai Korean Autonomous Township in Shuncheng District have implemented four new regulations regarding entertainment expenses, with the township leaders leading by example. From March 1 to June 30, the township hosted 450 visits from higher-level officials without any instances of excessive accompaniment or dining beyond the standard. The entertainment expenses for these four months amounted to 3,000 yuan, which is only one-tenth of the same period last year. Hao Xuebiao from Jiangsu's Jianhu County's Jiangying Township wrote: "Statistics show that in the first ten days of July, the entertainment expenses for all 23 villages in Jiangying Township were 29% of the same period last year. The reduction in entertainment practices has boosted the morale and unity of both officials and the public."

Information Two: Decline in Restaurant Business
Lü Weihan and Fu Yunping from the Price Bureau of Huainan City's Urban Adjustment Team in Anhui Province reported that restaurants like Zhu Fang, Xing Hua Village Restaurant, and Yongshun Restaurant, which were well-known in Huainan City, primarily catered to local government agencies, organizations, and enterprises, with public entertainment revenue accounting for over 70% of their total income. Since July, the business revenue of these restaurants has dropped by about 50% compared to the same period last year, mainly due to a significant decrease in public entertainment revenue. The manager of Xing Hua Village Restaurant mentioned that previously, the restaurant's monthly revenue was over 30,000 yuan, but in July, it was less than 10,000 yuan. Qiu Shenglin and Luo Xiong from Fujian's Guangze County wrote: "Since July, the restaurants and hotels in Guangze County that relied on earnings from government agencies, enterprises, and contractors have seen a significant drop in business, with no more luxury cars or bicycles parked outside."

Information Three: Serious and Thorough Investigation and Punishment
After the clean governance campaign was launched, many regions took concrete measures to actively investigate and punish violators. Zhu Ying from Anhui's Fuyang County Radio Station wrote that from November 1987 to May 1989, the Party Committee Secretary of Qiaokou Township, Wang Jingyun, and other township officials had 908 entertainment events, squandering over 44,000 yuan in public funds. On August 8, the county committee seriously investigated and punished the township's entertainment issues, giving Wang Jingyun the punishment of expulsion from the Party, dismissal from public office, and retention for one year. Xiong Yuanhui and Zeng Jinsheng from Hubei's Xiangyang County Committee Office wrote: "By mid-July, Xiangyang County had reported 28 officials for disciplinary violations related to entertainment, with one receiving a Party warning."

Information Four: Public Entertainment Still Exists
Guo Xiaoning and Dong Liuying from Jiangxi's Ruichang County Radio Station wrote: "While large-scale entertainment in busy streets has become rare, some remote restaurants and hotels that were previously quiet have seen a surge in business. In Ruichang City, a restaurant for sent-down youth, which previously had daily revenues of less than 100 yuan, has now increased to over 300 yuan. A private restaurant that previously had two rooms for guests has now added a third, sometimes even temporarily setting up a fourth room at the parents' residence, with business booming. It is reported that these customers are mostly leaders and business personnel from enterprises and government departments." Xing Shulong from Hainan's Tongshi City Radio and Television University and Zhu Kaining from the Tongshi City Political Consultative Conference wrote: "Tongshi Water Supply Company spent 76,945 yuan on entertainment last year, and in just the first six months of this year, they have already spent 75,186 yuan on entertainment, averaging 413 yuan per day. When will this practice be stopped?"

专栏：综述来信

    廉政建设有成效
    公款吃喝在减少
    目前，抓廉政建设、惩治腐败的工作正在各地进行。本报陆续收到安徽、江苏、黑龙江、内蒙古、湖北、湖南、河南、福建、海南等地有关纠正公款吃喝风的读者来信，从中可以看到一些值得注意的信息。
    信息之一：招待费用减少
    一些地方在抓公款吃喝问题上动手早，抓得紧，已经取得了明显的效果。辽宁抚顺市顺城区广播电视局艾庆君、苏长江来信说，顺城区李石寨朝鲜族镇党委和镇政府从今年3月起即对招待费用实行了4项新的规定，镇领导人带头执行。从3月1日到6月30日，这个镇接待上级来客450人次，没有一次出现多陪、就餐超标准的现象。4个月支付的招待费3000元，仅为去年同期的1／10。江苏建湖县蒋营乡政府郝学标来信说：“据统计，今年7月上旬，蒋营乡全乡23个村的招待费用是去年同期的29％。吃喝风的收敛，使全乡干部群众振奋了精神，增强了团结。”
    信息之二：餐店生意锐减
    安徽省淮北城调队物价科吕维彦、付云萍来信反映，锯房饭店，杏花村饭庄、永顺菜馆是淮北市小有名气的个体餐馆，以往主要向本市一些机关、团体和企事业单位开放，以经营筵席为主，公款吃喝的收入占总收入的70％以上。今年7月份以来，这些餐馆营业收入比去年同期下降了50％左右，主要是公款吃喝的收入大幅度下降。据杏花村饭庄经理介绍，从前杏花村饭庄平均每月营业额都在3万元以上，而7月份的营业额不足万元。福建光泽县委邱盛林、罗雄来信说：“7月以来，光泽县那些靠赚机关、企事业单位和包工头钱的菜馆、酒店门口，再也看不到小车和排队的自行车了。”
      信息之三：查处严肃认真
    廉政之风在各地吹起之后，许多地方采取具体措施，积极查处违纪者。安徽阜阳县广播电台朱颖来信说，阜阳县桥口乡1987年11月至1989年5月，乡党委书记王景云和其他乡干部共吃喝908场，挥霍公款44000多元。今年8月8日，县委严肃查处了这个乡的吃喝问题，给予王景云开除党籍、开除公职、留用一年的处分。湖北襄阳县委办公室熊元惠、曾进生来信介绍：“截至7月中旬，襄阳县先后有28名干部因违纪吃喝被县纪委通报批评，1名受到党内警告处分。”
      信息之四：公款吃喝仍存
    江西瑞昌县广播站郭小宁、董六玲来信说：“我们调查发现，在大街闹市大吃大喝消声匿迹的同时，一些地处偏僻原来生意清淡的餐馆酒家，最近生意却开始红火起来。瑞昌县城有家知青店，过去每天营业额在百元以下，最近增加到了300元以上。有家个体餐馆过去是二间房接待顾客，现在又增开一间，有时还要到父母住宅临时增设一间，生意日渐兴隆。据反映，这些吃客大多是企业和一些党政部门的领导人和业务人员。”海南通什市电大邢书龙、市政协朱开宁来信介绍：“通什自来水公司去年一年开支招待费76945元，今年仅头6个月就开支招待费75186元，平均每天吃喝413元，此风何时才能刹住？”
