Lebanese Christian Sect Accepts Arab League Peace Proposal
Arab League Urges International Community to Support Lebanese Peace Plan

BEIRUT, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) — The head of the Lebanese provisional military government, General Michel Aoun, announced today that he accepts the seven-point peace plan proposed by the Arab League's three-party committee in Jeddah.

In his brief televised speech, Aoun said, "The peace proposal will be implemented starting September 23." He added that following the requests of the international community, Arab nations, and all friends, as well as the wishes of the Lebanese people, he agreed to the Arab League's plan.

However, Aoun reiterated his determination to liberate Lebanon. He said, "Peace can only be achieved when every inch of our country's territory is restored to its sovereignty." He emphasized, "Liberating our land and restoring peace is our right and duty."

Aoun made this decision after three meetings with the Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab League, Abdulrahman Al-Atrash, and extensive consultations with prominent religious, political, and intellectual figures from the Christian community.

The Arab League's three-party committee proposed the seven-point peace plan in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah on September 16. The plan includes immediate comprehensive ceasefire, lifting the blockade on Christian-controlled ports, halting the supply of weapons to the warring factions in Lebanon, and holding a parliamentary session on September 30 to implement political reforms.

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) — The Arab League today called on the international community to support the efforts of the Lebanese and Arab peoples to end the Lebanese civil war and restore reconciliation and unity in the country.

Arab League Ambassador to the United Nations, Chedli Klibi, said in a statement, "Let us focus our efforts on accelerating the healing process of Lebanon's wounds and quickly formulate a blueprint for reconstruction and development."

Additionally, it was reported that the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement today expressing "great satisfaction" with the agreement of the conflicting parties in Lebanon to accept the Arab League's peace plan. France hopes that the peace process will proceed smoothly.
