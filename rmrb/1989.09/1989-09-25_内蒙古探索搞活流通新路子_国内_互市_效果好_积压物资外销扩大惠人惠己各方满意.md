Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been exploring new ways to activate circulation through various forms of domestic "mutual market" activities, balancing surpluses and shortages. Recently, Inner Mongolia held a three-day "mutual market" event with Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Dalian, achieving a transaction volume of over 800 million yuan, with unexpectedly good results.

Relevant leaders and experts believe that in the current situation of tight credit, insufficient funds, blocked circulation, and large-scale accumulation of goods, this exchange method is a flexible and effective approach.

Inner Mongolia is an important production base for livestock products and raw materials in China. Due to severe shortages of funds, produced goods cannot be exported, and urgently needed production and living supplies cannot be purchased. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of accumulated livestock products and various goods in Inner Mongolia currently amounts to over 2 billion yuan. The difficulties in purchasing agricultural and sideline products are even greater, with a funding gap of approximately 2.4 billion yuan.

Given the above situation, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region proposed the initiative of "mutual market" with relevant provinces and cities two months ago, aiming to exchange surpluses and shortages, revive accumulated goods, and jointly activate the economy. This initiative was welcomed by the relevant provinces and cities. During the "mutual market" event, they communicated openly, cooperated enthusiastically, and achieved mutual benefits, with remarkable results.

This "mutual market" form is flexible and diverse: there are barter exchanges, deferred sales with interest, and cash purchases, among other methods, all of which expanded the transaction volume. At the same time, the "mutual market" participants implemented flexible and open policies, considering the big picture, long-term benefits, the interest on funds occupied by accumulated goods, the increased waste from long-term storage, and the impact on production and circulation obstacles. Everyone reduced prices and benefits, achieving mutual benefits.

    内蒙古探索搞活流通新路子
    国内“互市”效果好
    积压物资外销扩大惠人惠己各方满意
    本报呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区在国内开展各种形式的“互市”活动，调剂余缺，在搞活流通方面探索出一条路子。前不久，内蒙古自治区与辽宁、河北、山西、江苏、浙江、北京、天津、武汉、大连等省、市联合举行了为期三天的“互市”会，成交额达8亿多元，收到了意想不到的效果。
    有关领导和专家们认为：在当前紧缩银根、资金短缺、流通梗阻、货物大量积压的情况下，这种交换方式不失为一条灵活有效的途径。
    内蒙古是我国重要的畜产品和原材料生产基地，由于资金严重短缺，生产产品不能外销，生产、生活急需品又购不进来。据不完全统计，内蒙古目前积压畜产品及各种货物总金额达20多亿元，目前收购农副产品面临的困难更大，资金缺口约24亿元。
    鉴于上述情况，内蒙古自治区早在两个月以前就与有关省、市联系，提出了以互通有无、使积压物资起死回生、共同搞活经济为目的的“互市”的倡议。这一倡议受到有关省、市的欢迎。在“互市”会上他们坦诚相谈，热忱合作，互惠互利，各得其所，成效十分显著。
    这种“互市”形式灵活多样：有以货易货，有赊销付息，也有现金购货等各种方式，扩大了成交额。同时，“互市”各方实行灵活开明的政策，算大帐，算远帐，算积压占用资金增加利息的帐，算长期库存增加损耗浪费的帐，算影响生产阻滞流通的帐，大家都互相削价让利，做到了惠人惠己。　（傲腾　崔国柱）
