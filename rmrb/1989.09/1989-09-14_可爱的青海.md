Lovely Qinghai

Marshal Zhu De, during his inspection of Qinghai in 1958, wrote: "Qinghai is vast and rich in resources, a very lovely place in our motherland." This article selects a few Kunlun grasses and snow mountain flowers growing on the land of Qinghai.

The Source of Rivers

"The waters of the Yellow River come from the sky." The Yellow River, with a total length of 5,464 kilometers, originates from the north slope of Bayan Har Mountains and the valley of Qiaoziyaya Mountain in the Kairi River valley and the Yoguzonglie Basin in Qinghai. The elevation of these areas ranges from 4,600 to 4,800 meters, and the source is a gurgling stream and trickling spring water.

The Yangtze River, with a total length of 6,380 kilometers, also has its source in Qinghai. It originates from the southwest side of the glacier of Jiangendiluo on the main peak of the Tanggula Mountains, which is 6,620 meters above sea level. The melting water of the vast glacier is the source of the ten-thousand-mile Yangtze River.

Rich Mineral Resources

Qinghai is rich in mineral resources, with 37 types of minerals ranking in the top ten nationwide. Among them, eight types rank first: lithium, potash, lake salt, magnesium salt, bromine, chemical gypsum, nepheline, and asbestos. The reserves of potassium fertilizer raw material potassium chloride account for 96.8% of the national total; the proven reserves of sodium salt account for more than half of the national total; the proven reserves of asbestos mines account for more than 40% of the national total, and the quality is excellent. Among them, Mangya asbestos is famous both at home and abroad.

Pearl of Kunlun

Golmud is a Mongolian word meaning "a place where rivers converge." In 1952, the pioneers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway set up the first tent in Golmud by the Kunlun Mountains. Since then, Golmud, which did not even have a name on the old society's map, has awakened. Now, modern buildings with dense greenery cover an area of 17 square kilometers, and the population of the city area reaches 120,000. In 1980, with the approval of the State Council, China's first salt lake city, Golmud, was established. With salt chemical industry as the mainstay, Golmud is becoming the political, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, and tourist center of western Qinghai.

High-Yield Spring Wheat

Where is the highest yield per mu of spring wheat in China? In the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. In 1978, a high-yield field of 3.91 mu in Xiangride Farm produced 1,013.05 kilograms of spring wheat per mu. According to the 1979 report of "World Agriculture" magazine: the highest yield per mu in the United States wheat test field is 937 kilograms.

The Ship of the Snow Mountains

The yak is known as the "ship of the snow mountains," living year-round on the roof of the world. Qinghai is the place with the most yaks in the world, with more than 5 million yaks in the province, accounting for nearly half of the yaks in the country and about one-third of the world's total yak population.

### 可爱的青海

　　可爱的青海
    朱德元帅一九五八年视察青海时曾挥毫题词：“青海地大物博，是祖国的一个十分可爱的地方。”这里采撷的只是生长在青海土地上的几枝昆仑草、几朵雪山花。
    江河源头
    “黄河之水天上来。”全长五千四百六十四公里的黄河，发源于青海巴颜喀拉山北麓各姿各雅山下的卡日河谷和约古宗列盆地，两地海拔在四千六百多米至四千八百多米之间，源头是潺潺溪流、涓涓泉水。
    全长六千三百八十公里的长江，源头也在青海。它发源于唐古拉山脉主峰海拔六千六百二十米的各拉丹冬冰峰西南侧姜根迪如冰川。巨大冰川的融水，即为万里长江的源头之水。
    丰富矿藏
    青海矿产资源丰富，有三十七种矿产储量名列全国各省前十位。其中居第一位的有锂、钾盐、池盐、镁盐、溴、化工灰岩、云石、石棉八种。农业生产急需的钾肥原料氯化钾储量占全国总储量的百分之九十六点八；钠盐探明储量占全国的一半以上；石棉矿已探明储量占全国的百分之四十以上，且棉质极佳，其中茫崖石棉驰名中外。
    昆仑明珠
    格尔木系蒙古语，意即河流密集之地。一九五二年，青藏公路的开拓者们在昆仑山下格尔木河畔扎下第一顶帐篷。从此，旧社会地图上连名字都没有的格尔木苏醒了。现在，鳞次栉比、绿树掩映的现代建筑构成十七平方公里的市区，市区人口达十二万。一九八○年经国务院批准，成立了我国第一座盐湖城——格尔木市。以盐化工业为主体，格尔木正成为青海西部的政治、经济、科教、文化、旅游中心。
    高产春麦
    我国春小麦亩产最高纪录在哪里？在青海柴达木盆地。一九七八年香日德农场一块三点九一亩的高产田，亩产春小麦一千零一十三点零五公斤。据《世界农业》杂志一九七九年报道：美国小麦试验田最高亩产量为九百三十七公斤。
    雪山之舟
    牦牛被称为“雪山之舟”，长年生活在世界屋脊。青海是世界上产牦牛最多的地方，全省有牦牛五百多万头，接近全国牦牛的一半，约占世界牦牛总数的三分之一。　（余　昭）
