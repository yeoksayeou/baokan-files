Recently, in the administrative transparency columns of various counties and cities in the Hebei Province's Xingtai region, all units and individuals that have delayed or occupied public funds and loans have been publicly "exposed." This has promoted the collection of funds and ensured the gathering of funds for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products.

The publicly "exposed" funds include five categories, totaling 6.3 billion yuan in the region, including personal delays in repaying public funds and loans, the suppression of funds for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and grains by the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Grain Department, as well as the "triangular" debts between banks, enterprises, and units.

The cleanup of funds is an important measure taken by the Xingtai region during the rectification and adjustment to ease the tight financial situation and gather funds for the autumn purchase of agricultural and sideline products. Starting from June, "Five Clean" offices composed of banks, finance, taxation, and audit departments were established in the region and 16 counties and cities. Self-inspection, self-cleanup, and organizational cleanup were combined, and inspection and cleanup were combined with the mobilization of the masses for supervision and reporting. Banks, units, and individuals were cleaned up one by one. In Baixiang County, 1 million yuan of public funds were privately occupied, and in Qinghe County, over 100 million yuan of personal overdue loans were delayed and not repaid. The grain department in Shahe City even diverted 8.9 million yuan of grain purchase funds for other uses. The masses were indignant, saying, "Public funds for private use, loans not repaid, how can production not lack money?"

For the published overdue payments and irrational occupation of funds, the region set the latest deadline for repayment. Those who do not repay by the deadline will be strictly dealt with, thereby accelerating the recovery of funds. Weixian County listed over a hundred cases of personal delays in repaying public funds and bank loans, and even the overdue loans introduced by the county party secretary and county magistrate were published to the public. In less than a week, the entire county repaid over 200 million yuan. Within five days after the 10.3 million yuan of public funds delayed by individuals in Xinhe County were "exposed," all of it was recovered. By the end of August, the entire region had recovered 2.2 billion yuan in funds.

　　六亿多元不合理占用资金被“曝光”
　　邢台开展资金清理工作
　　全地区三个月收回资金二亿多元
    本报讯　近日来，在河北省邢台地区各县市的政务公开栏上，所有拖欠、占用公款、贷款的单位和个人一一当众“曝光”，促进了资金的收缴，保证了农副产品收购资金的筹集。
    当众“曝光”的资金共有五项，全区累计6.3亿元，包括个人拖欠公款、贷款，供销社、粮食系统挤占农副产品和粮油收购资金，以及银行、企业、单位之间拖欠的“三角”债务。
    开展资金清理，是邢台地区在治理整顿中为缓和资金紧张形势、筹集秋季农副产品收购资金采取的重要措施。从6月份开始，在地区和16个县市成立了由银行、财政、税务、审计等部门组成的“五清”办公室，采取自查、自清和组织清理相结合、检查清理与发动群众监督举报相结合的办法，对银行、单位和个人逐一进行清理。柏乡县有100万元公款被私人占用，清河县上亿元个人逾期贷款欠拖不还，沙河市粮食部门竟把89万元粮食收购资金挪作他用。群众气愤地说：“公款私用、贷款不还，生产哪能不缺钱”。
    对于公布的欠款和不合理占用资金，地区规定了清还最晚期限，到期不还的，坚决严肃处理，从而加快资金回收速度。威县把上百起个人拖欠的公款和银行贷款，逐笔拉出清单，连同县委书记、县长介绍的逾期贷款也公布于众，不到一周，全县就还款200多万元。新河县个人拖欠的10.3万元公款，“曝光”后5天就全部收回。到8月底，全区已收回资金2.2亿元。
