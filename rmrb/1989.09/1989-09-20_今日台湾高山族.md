The indigenous peoples of Taiwan, numbering approximately 300,000, make up less than 2% of the province's total population. When divided by language and customs, the indigenous peoples actually consist of nine distinct ethnic groups: the Atayal, Saisiyat, Bunun, Tsou, Rukai, Paiwan, Puyuma, Amis, and Yami.

For a long time, the indigenous peoples have suffered under the discrimination and oppression of successive ruling classes, which has severely hindered their economic and cultural development. Many of their communities remain quite backward, and some primitive practices are still preserved. Among the mountain-dwelling ethnic groups, only the Paiwan have entered a feudal aristocratic hereditary society, while the other groups to varying degrees retain certain characteristics of clan systems and live a semi-agricultural, semi-hunting lifestyle.

The Amis, who live in the eastern valleys and coastal areas of Taiwan Province, and the Puyuma in southeastern Taiwan, although influenced by the outside world and with parts of their social life Sinicized, still preserve the unique tradition of matriarchy, making it a significant feature of the ethnic culture in eastern Taiwan today.

Currently, within Taiwanese society, there still exists varying degrees of contempt or discrimination towards the indigenous peoples.

    今日台湾高山族
    曲日
    高山族同胞现在大约30多万人，占台湾全省人口不到2％。若按语言和风俗来分，高山族实际上分为九个族群。即：泰雅族、赛夏族、布农族、曹族、鲁凯族、排湾族、卑南族、阿美族、雅美族。
    长期以来，高山族同胞在历代统治阶级的歧视和压迫下，其经济、文化发展受到严重阻滞，不少族区还相当落后，一些原始的东西至今还保留着。在山区的族群中，只有排湾族进入封建贵族世袭制社会，而其他各族群均不同程度保留着氏族制度的某些特征，过着半耕半猎的生活。
    聚住在台湾省东部峡谷和海岸线一带的阿美族及台湾东南的卑南族，虽受外界影响，社会生活部分已经汉化，但迄今为止仍保存以母系为社会主体的特殊传统，成为今天东台湾种族文化的一大特征。
    目前，在台湾社会中，对高山族同胞还存有或多或少的轻视或歧视。（附图片）
