People's Daily, Tokyo, September 19th - Reporter Yu Qing: This afternoon, Ito Masayoshi, the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union, returned to Tokyo after his visit to China. In an interview with the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) television, Ito said he saw Deng Xiaoping in very good health. Chinese leaders firmly expressed their determination to continue with reform and opening up. Japan and the rest of the world will be paying close attention.

Regarding the issue of Japan's restrictions on visits to China, Ito said: "The current martial law in China is different from what Japan and other countries imagine. From the perspective of public security and other aspects, I believe Japan can lift the restrictions on travel to Beijing. This is the impression I brought back."

Regarding the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and China, Ito said: "I believe that the relationship between Japan and China is different from that between the U.S. and China, and between Europe and China. Therefore, Japan should take the lead in economic cooperation with China, even if it means taking half a step or a step ahead. This is very important."

Ito expressed that he will report his observations from the visit to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata tomorrow.

　　伊东正义回到东京后说
　　邓小平身体很健康
　　中国继续改革开放
    本报东京9月19日电　记者于青报道：今天下午结束访华回到东京的日中友好议员联盟会长伊东正义，在接受日本广播协会电视台采访时说，他看到邓小平身体非常健康。中国领导人都坚定地表示要继续推进改革开放。日本和世界各国都将予以关注。
    在谈到日本的访华限制问题时，伊东说：“现在中国正在实施的戒严令，与日本和其他国家所想象的戒严令不一样。从治安等各方面的情况看，我认为日本可以解除赴北京的限制。我是带着这个印象回来的。”
    关于日中经济合作问题，伊东说：“我认为日中关系与美中、欧中关系不同。因此日本应该率先与中国进行经济合作，哪怕提前半步或一步也好。这是很重要的。”
    伊东表示，明天将把访华见闻立即向海部首相和中山外相汇报。
