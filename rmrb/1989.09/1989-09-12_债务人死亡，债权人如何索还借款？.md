Editor,

A friend of mine lent 8,000 yuan to a relative of his. Shortly after, the relative passed away. The relative's family is aware of the loan, but they refuse to repay it, stating that the money was not borrowed from them personally. How can my friend recover this loan?

Mr. Xu Guotong,

Lending money establishes a debt relationship. The creditor has the right to demand that the debtor fulfill their obligations as agreed upon in the contract or as stipulated by law. As long as the lending relationship between individuals complies with legal regulations, it is protected by the state's laws.

The issue you raised involves whether there was a contractual agreement between your friend and his relative regarding the loan. If there was an agreement and it is genuine, credible, and compliant with the law, even if the debtor has passed away, your friend can use this as evidence to demand repayment from the debtor's legal heirs. According to the inheritance law, heirs who inherit the property of the deceased are also responsible for settling the deceased's legal debts. The principle is that the settlement is limited to the actual value of the estate. If the debt exceeds the actual value of the estate, the heirs are not obligated to repay the excess amount, but they may voluntarily repay it if they choose. If the actual value of the estate is greater than the debt, the heirs, in accordance with the order of inheritance, have the right to inherit the first category of heirs, based on the principle of gender equality and equal rights and obligations, to determine each person's share of the inheritance. After confirming each person's share of the inheritance, they should bear the debt in proportion to the amount of inheritance they receive. If the debt left by the deceased was caused by the heirs' failure to fulfill their duty of support, even if the estate is insufficient to settle the debt, the heirs still bear the joint and several liability for repayment.

As mentioned above, if the heirs of the deceased deny that the deceased borrowed money from your friend, your friend can sue in court and provide written evidence or necessary evidence leads for the court to adjudicate. If your friend lent money to the deceased without a contractual agreement but with witnesses who have no interest in the matter, they can also sue in court. If your friend lent money to the deceased without a contractual agreement and without witnesses, and the deceased's relatives do not acknowledge it, your friend's lawsuit will not be accepted by the court. This is because the court handles cases based on the principle of "who sues, who provides evidence." From your letter, it seems that your friend's lending of money to the deceased is known to the deceased's relatives. Therefore, your friend can sue in court. If your friend knew that the deceased borrowed the money for gambling, smuggling, speculation, or other illegal activities, the loan relationship will not be protected by law. Therefore, the relatives of the deceased have a reasonable basis for not repaying the loan.

　　债务人死亡，债权人如何索还借款？
    编辑同志：
    我的一位朋友曾借给他亲友8000元钱，不久他的那位亲友去世了。亲友家人是知道此事的，但她不想还钱，理由是钱没有借给她本人。请问：我的朋友如何索还这笔借款？

    徐国通同志：
    借钱是一种债务关系。债权人有权要求债务人按照合同的约定或者依照法律的规定履行义务。公民之间的借债关系，只要符合法律规定，就受国家法律的保护。
    你来信反映的问题，这要看你那位朋友和他的亲友之间产生的借债关系当时是否有合同的约定。有约定，并且真实可信，符合法律规定，债务人尽管已经去世，你的朋友可以以此为据向债务人的合法继承人索要。因为，继承法规定，继承人继承被继承人遗产的同时，对被继承人遗留的合法债务，应当负责清偿。清偿的原则是以遗产实际价值为限。如果债务数额超过遗产的实际价值，其超过部分，继承人没有清偿的义务，但自愿偿还不在此限。如果被继承人的遗产的实际价值比所欠债务多，则应按继承顺序，对被继承人有继承权的第一顺序继承人，根据男女平等，权利和义务一致的原则，在确定每个人的继承份额后，依照每个人继承遗产的多少，按比例分担债务。如果被继承人生前所欠的债务，是由于继承人应尽而未尽赡养义务造成的，即使遗产不足清偿，继承人仍负有清偿债务的连带责任。
    如上所述，死者的继承人如否认死者生前向你的朋友借款的事，你的朋友可以向法院起诉，并提供书面的证据或必要的证据线索，由法院裁决。你的朋友借款给死者时，若无合同约定，但有无利害关系的人可以证明，也可向法院起诉。如果你的朋友借款给死者时，既无合同约定，又无人证明，死者的亲属又不承认，你的朋友向法院提起诉讼，法院是无法受理的。因为法院处理案件遵循的是“谁起诉，谁举证”的原则。从来信看，你的朋友借钱给死者一事，死者的亲属是知道的，据此，你的朋友可以向法院起诉。假如你的朋友明知死者借款是为了赌博、走私、投机倒把等违法犯罪活动，其借债关系法律不予保护。因此，死者的亲属不负清偿借债的理由也在情理之中。
