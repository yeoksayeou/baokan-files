Liu Jianfeng was elected governor of Hainan Province today at the conclusion of the third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress.

Liu Jianfeng, 53, is a university graduate who joined the workforce in October 1961 and became a member of the Communist Party of China in May 1956. He has previously served as deputy minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry, deputy secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee, and vice secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee.

In his address to the third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress, Liu Jianfeng stated that the various preferential policies granted by the central government to Hainan will continue to be implemented. He emphasized that in both reform and opening up, an active attitude should be adopted and steps should be taken more boldly. He pointed out that in the short term, Hainan's economy should focus on foundational work. While strengthening infrastructure construction, efforts should be made to improve the investment environment; agriculture should be developed to increase the province's grain self-sufficiency rate; the financial difficulties of counties and cities should be effectively addressed; and scientific and technological progress and technological promotion should be treated as a key task in foundational work.
