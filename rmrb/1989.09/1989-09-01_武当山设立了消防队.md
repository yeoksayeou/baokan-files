After your newspaper published the letter to the editor titled "A Firefighting Team Should Be Established on Mount Wudang" on May 10th on the sixth page, the Mount Wudang Scenic Area Management Bureau paid great attention to the matter. Currently, Mount Wudang has established a firefighting team consisting of thirteen people, equipped with one light fire truck and six walkie-talkies. Across the mountain, twenty-nine fire ponds, nine fire prevention ponds, over four thousand meters of pipelines, and 780 meters of fire hoses have been built at various cultural relic sites. Additionally, fire prevention contracts have been signed with relevant personnel, effectively implementing preventive measures against fires.
