"Wholeheartedly relying on the working class is not just a matter of words, but of taking concrete actions to reflect the working class's role as masters and the main force," said this afternoon by veteran worker Xia Genwang of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory after attending the second joint meeting between the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Shaanxi Provincial Trade Union Federation.

On December 20th of last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Trade Union Federation held their first joint meeting. They discussed and made resolutions on four key issues: implementing the "Shaanxi Province Implementation Details for the Enterprise Law to Strengthen Democratic Management of Workers," restoring the distribution of workers' health food based on actual standards, solving the living difficulties of provincial-level and above labor models, and leveraging workers' price supervision roles. This joint meeting system between the government and the trade union has recently been noted and affirmed by central leaders and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Yesterday's second joint meeting between the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Trade Union Federation focused on two main topics: mobilizing the broad masses of workers to deeply carry out the "Double Increase, Double Economy" campaign, and further improving the democratic management work of enterprise workers. Both the trade union and the government had more than ten representatives speak.

    陕西省府与总工会实行联席会议制度
    本报西安9月24日电　“全心全意依靠工人阶级不是停留在口头上，而是用实际行动体现工人阶级的主人翁地位和主力军作用”，这是秦川机床厂老工人夏根旺昨日下午旁听了陕西省政府与省总工会第二次联席会议后发出的感慨。
    去年12月20日，陕西省政府与省总工会举行第一次联席会议，就颁发《陕西省贯彻执行〈企业法〉加强职工民主管理实施细则》、恢复职工保健食品按实物标准发放、解决省级以上职工劳模生活困难、发挥职工物价监督作用等4个议题，经过认真讨论作出了相应的决议。这种政府与工会联席会议制度，前不久受到中央领导同志和全国总工会的重视和肯定。
    昨天举行的陕西省府与省总工会第二次联席会议，确立了两个主要议题：一是发动广大职工深入开展“双增双节”运动；二是进一步完善企业职工民主管理工作。
    工会和政府双方先后有十多位同志发言。
