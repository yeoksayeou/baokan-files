Guizhou, known for its rugged terrain where "there is no flat land for three feet," has seen significant economic development in its mountainous regions thanks to the extensive network of highways. The old days of "looking at mountains and exhausting horses" are largely a thing of the past. Statistics show that the province now has over 32,000 kilometers of paved roads, which is 16.4 times the amount at the founding of the People's Republic. The road density is higher than the national average. In 1988, the province's road transportation accounted for 85.1% of the total passenger and freight volume.

In addition to utilizing national investments, Guizhou has been persistent in adopting a combination of self-raised funds and multi-channel financing to build roads.

    贵州公路建设发展迅速
    本报贵阳9月2日电　记者潘帝都报道：被称为“地无三尺平”的贵州，四通八达的公路有力地促进了全省山区经济的发展，昔日那种看山跑死马的状况已大为改观。据统计，目前全省已有通车公路32000多公里，相当于建国初期的16.4倍，公路密度高于全国平均水平。1988年全省公路的客、货运量占全省总客、货运量的85.1％。
  贵州除利用国家投资外，坚持采取自筹资金与多方集资相结合的办法修公路。
