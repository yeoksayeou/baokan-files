From the October Revolution to the founding of New China, a long period has passed, during which the peoples of the two countries have forged a friendship. In those stagnant years, a gloom hung over the relations between the two countries. Your meeting with Gorbachev has now dispelled the gloom.

"End the past, open the future," your words have convinced me. They will serve as a reliable guarantee, ensuring that the dialogue between the two parties will always be filled with a constructive atmosphere. The great Chinese people have embarked on the path of reform, and our ship is also sailing in the same direction. In China, we have found a brother. May the peoples of the two countries live in peace and together advance towards a society of renewal.

    致邓小平
   （苏联火车司机）鲍里斯·戈果霍夫从十月革命，到新中国的建立，经过漫长的岁月，两国人民结下了友谊。在那停滞的年代，阴霾笼罩着两国关系，您与戈尔巴乔夫举行会晤，如今阴霾已经散去。
  “结束过去，开辟未来”，您的话令我深信不疑。它将成为可靠的保证，使苏中两党的对话，永远充满建设性的气氛。伟大的中国人民，走上改革的道路，我国的航船也朝着同一航向，在中国找到了兄弟。愿两国人民生活在和平中，共同走向革新的社会。
