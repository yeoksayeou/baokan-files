South Africa's regime is in a bind both internally and externally, finding it hard to get by, so it has come up with a peculiar scheme: using nerve gas and pesticides to secretly harm South African anti-apartheid leaders.

The story goes like this: South African Council of Churches Secretary-General Frank Chikane (Archbishop Tutu's successor) recently visited the United States. During his visit, he fell ill three times with a "mysterious illness." Once, while visiting Wisconsin, he nearly died. Chikane's doctor, after investigation and research, uncovered the cause of this "mysterious illness." It turns out that someone had secretly sprayed his luggage and clothes with highly toxic nerve gas or pesticides. The magazine *U.S. News & World Report* also reported that this is a "new weapon" devised by the South African regime to deal with anti-apartheid activists. For this reason, the doctor lodged a strong protest with the South African regime.

What a "new weapon"! It is clear that the South African regime merely wants to use this to disrupt the anti-apartheid struggle of the broad black masses while also covering up their crimes without a trace. It's a classic case of killing two birds with one stone, isn't it? Little did they know that their tracks would be exposed, and their sinister intentions laid bare.

However, this does make one thing clear: the South African regime is on its last legs. This move in no way shows that it is powerful and strong; on the contrary, it is a true reflection of its weakness and cowardice.

    真实写照
    士　芳
    南非当局内外交困，日子难过，遂出奇招：用神经瓦斯和杀虫剂暗害南非反种族主义领导人。
    事情是这样的：南非宗教会议秘书长弗兰克·奇开尼牧师（大主教图图的接班人）前不久去美国访问，其间，因患一种
  “神秘病”而连续病倒三次。有一次，他在访问威斯康辛时差点死去。奇开尼牧师的医生经调查研究后揭穿了这种“神秘病”的缘由。原来，这是由于有人暗中向奇开尼的行李和衣服喷洒了剧毒的神经瓦斯或杀虫剂所致。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志也说，这是南非当局想出来的专门对付反种族主义分子的“最新武器”。为此，这位医生向南非当局提出强烈控告。
    好一个“最新武器”。很明显，南非当局无非想借此破坏广大黑人群众的反种族主义斗争，又能神不知鬼不觉地掩盖罪责。真是一石两鸟，好不美哉！殊不知，马脚败露，险恶用心昭然若揭。
    不过，这倒也清楚表明：南非当局日暮途穷，此举丝毫说明不了它有力和强大，恰恰相反，这正是其虚弱和怯懦的真实写照。
