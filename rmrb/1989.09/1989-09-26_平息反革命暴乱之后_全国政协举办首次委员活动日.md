Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th - Hundreds of members and standing committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are in Beijing gathered enthusiastically at the CPPCC Hall this afternoon to participate in the first session of the CPPCC members' activity day since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The activity day, organized by the General Office of the National Committee of the CPPCC, aims to strengthen ties and exchange information. It was usually held once a month, but the turmoil and rebellion that occurred in the spring and summer interrupted this popular activity for several months. This is the 10th session of the activity day held by the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC.

In various rooms, members who had not seen each other for a long time exchanged greetings and had friendly conversations. The turmoil of a few months ago still left them with many thoughts. Some members also shared their experiences from participating in the CPPCC's inspection activities and various investigations and research activities. The exhibition of members' calligraphy and paintings, held to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the CPPCC, attracted many viewers. Some members appreciated the calligraphy and paintings while recalling the achievements of the CPPCC over the past 40 years. The newly opened tea house provided a quiet place for members to converse.

The grand hall's movie screening, the third-floor ballroom's dance, and the chess, go, and health consultations in the third, fourth, and fifth meeting rooms also attracted groups of members.

    平息反革命暴乱之后
    全国政协举办首次委员活动日
    新华社北京9月25日电　（记者邹爱国、张宿堂）数百名在京的全国政协委员、常委，今天下午兴致勃勃地来到政协礼堂，参加平息反革命暴乱后的首次在京政协委员活动日。
    由全国政协办公厅举办的、以联络感情、交流信息为目的的委员活动日，过去基本上每月举办一次，春夏之交发生的动乱、暴乱使这项深受委员欢迎的活动中断数月。这次是七届全国政协举行的第10次委员活动日。
    在各个厅室里，久别重逢的委员们纷纷互致问候，亲切交谈，几个月前的那场风波使他们至今感慨良多。一些委员还畅谈了参加全国政协组织的考察活动和各种调查、研究活动的体会。为庆祝人民政协成立40周年而举办的委员书画展吸引了众多的观众。有的委员一边欣赏书画，一边回顾政协40年来的成就。新开设的茶座为委员们的交谈提供了安静的场所。
    大礼堂的电影，三楼大厅的舞会，第三、四、五会议室的象棋、围棋、保健咨询，也吸引了一批批委员。
