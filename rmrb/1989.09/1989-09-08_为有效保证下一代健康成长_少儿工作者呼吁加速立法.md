Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Zhang Sutan and Wang Nemei report from Beijing: A group of experts, scientists, and educators working with children and adolescents today issued a call: legislation for children and adolescent affairs must be expedited to quickly establish a set of laws and regulations that can effectively guarantee the growth, development, and various rights of children and adolescents.

A three-day national conference on optimal birth, upbringing, and education concluded today. Participants in the conference expressed deep concern over the current lack of legal construction in China's children and adolescent affairs: not only do many citizens have a weak legal consciousness regarding the birth, upbringing, and education of their children, but some units, and even some law-enforcement departments, also have a weak legal consciousness.

It is understood that the State Council has decided to establish a unified organization to coordinate women and children's work, thereby strengthening leadership and guidance for this work. At the same time, relevant departments are preparing to establish a major contribution award for optimal birth, upbringing, and education work.

    为有效保证下一代健康成长
    少儿工作者呼吁加速立法
    本报北京9月8日讯　新华社记者张宿堂、本报记者王娜梅报道：一批从事儿童少年工作的专家、科技人员和教育工作者今天在这里发出呼吁：要从速加强儿童少年事业的立法工作，较快形成一个能够有效保证儿童少年生长、发育、发展以及各项权益的配套的法律法规体系。
    为期三天的全国优生、优育、优教讨论会今天在这里结束。参加会议的儿童少年工作者对我国目前儿童少年事业法律建设方面的空白表示了深深的忧虑：不仅相当多的公民对子女生、育、教的法律意识淡薄，而且一些单位，甚至是一些负责执法的职责部门法律意识也比较淡薄。
    据了解，国务院已决定建立一个统一协调妇女儿童工作的组织，以加强对这项工作的领导和指导。同时，有关部门正准备设立优生、优育、优教工作的重大贡献奖。
