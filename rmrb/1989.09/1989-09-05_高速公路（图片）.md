The Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, with a total length of 375.5 kilometers, has already completed 258 kilometers and is scheduled to be fully operational by September next year. This is currently the longest expressway on the mainland.

This expressway, costing 2.2 billion yuan, is mainly funded and constructed by Liaoning Province. The road surface is 26 meters wide, with a 3-meter median strip, and features four lanes in each direction. It is designed to handle 50,000 vehicles per day and night, with an annual freight capacity of 80 million tons and a passenger capacity of 130 million people. The speed limit is set at 100 kilometers per hour or more. At the 225-kilometer mark, a military airstrip that can be used in both peacetime and wartime has been built, and it will be put into use before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The Shenyang-Dalian Expressway connects Shenyang, Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou, and Dalian. It links Dalian Port, Yingkou Port, and Beilang Port, as well as the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, the Yingkou Beilang Export Processing Zone, and the Shenyang Tiexi Industrial Zone. It significantly improves the investment environment in the Liaodong Peninsula. Previously, it took over 11 hours to travel from Shenyang to Dalian, but now it will only take about 4 hours by car.

    高速公路
    全长375.5公里的沈（阳）大（连）高速公路，已竣工258公里，明年9月份全部建成。这是目前大陆最长的一条高速公路。
    这条耗资22亿元的高速公路，主要是靠辽宁省集资兴建的。公路路面宽26米，分隔带3米，上下行四个车道。设计能力为每昼夜5万辆次，年货运能力为8000万吨，客运能力为1.3亿人次，车速达100公里／小时以上。这条高速公路的225公里处，建设了一条平战结合的军用飞机跑道，将在国庆40周年前夕交付使用。
    沈大高速公路连接了沈阳市、辽阳市、鞍山市、营口市和大连市。通过它，把大连港、营口港、鲅鱼圈港连接起来，把大连经济技术开发区、营口鲅鱼圈出口加工区和沈阳铁西工业区连接了起来。它大大改善了辽东半岛的投资环境，过去从沈阳到大连需要11个多小时，今后只要乘车行4小时左右就到了。
