	Li Guixian Points Out at an International Conference: China Wishes to Develop International Exchanges and Cooperation, Contribute to the Prosperity of the World Economy

	People's Daily, Washington, September 27 (Reporter Zhang Liang) -- Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, stated in his speech at the 44th Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank today that ten years of reform and opening up have brought initial prosperity to China, benefiting the people, and the policies of reform and opening up have deeply taken root. No matter what setbacks and difficulties we encounter in the process of moving forward, the Chinese government and people have the confidence to continuously push forward the construction of socialist modernization. We are willing to strengthen and develop international exchanges and cooperation, and contribute to the prosperity of the world economy.

	Li Guixian said, we respect all foreign governments and friends who engage in equal exchanges with us, and will continue to develop and strive to expand friendly relations with them. We are continuously improving the investment environment and continue to welcome foreign investors to invest in China. We are willing to use various foreign loans on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese government is trustworthy and has the full capacity to repay debts.

	Li Guixian pointed out that the continued stable development of the world economy requires the joint efforts of developed countries and developing countries, coordination and cooperation to create a good economic growth environment. In the current increasingly interdependent world economic environment, without the economic development and financial stability of developing countries, the economic growth of developed countries will also be difficult to sustain. Since the economic policies of developed countries have an important impact on the world economy, developed countries, especially major developed countries, should bear the main responsibility for improving the current international economic and trade environment.

	Li Guixian said, since the last annual meeting, the international community has made new efforts to reduce the debt burden of developing countries, making some progress in solving this problem. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have also taken active measures to help heavily indebted countries implement new debt relief plans. We support this. We hope that the international community will consider the different difficulties of all debt countries, take practical measures to further ease the debt repayment burden of debt countries, and especially actively increase new funds to help debt countries restore growth during the adjustment.

    李贵鲜在一国际会议上指出
    中国愿发展国际交往合作
    为繁荣世界经济作出贡献
    本报华盛顿9月27日电　记者张亮报道：国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜今天在国际货币基金组织和世界银行第44届年会上发言时指出，十年改革开放给中国带来了初步的繁荣昌盛，人民得到了好处，改革、开放政策已深入人心。不管在前进的过程中遇到什么挫折和困难，中国政府和中国人民有信心把社会主义现代化建设不断推向前进，愿意加强和发展国际交往和合作，为促进世界经济繁荣作出我们的贡献。
    李贵鲜说，我们尊重一切和我们平等交往的外国政府和外国朋友，将继续开展和努力扩大同他们之间的友好关系。我们正在不断改善投资环境，继续欢迎外国投资者来华投资，我们愿在平等互利的原则下使用国外境外的各种贷款。中国政府是守信誉的，也具有充分的还债能力。
    李贵鲜指出，世界经济的继续稳定发展，需要发达国家和发展中国家的共同努力，协调合作，创造出一个良好的经济增长环境。在当前日益相互依存的世界经济环境中，没有发展中国家的经济发展和金融稳定，发达国家的经济增长也就很难持久。由于发达国家经济政策对世界经济有重要影响，发达国家，特别是主要发达国家应承担改善当前国际经济和贸易环境的主要责任。
    李贵鲜说，从上届年会以来，国际社会为减轻发展中国家的债务负担做出了新的努力，使这一问题的解决有了一定的进展。国际货币基金组织和世界银行也积极采取措施，帮助重债国实施新的减债方案，我们对此表示支持。我们希望国际社会考虑所有债务国不同困难，切实采取措施，进一步减缓债务国偿债负担，特别要积极增加新资金，帮助债务国在调整中恢复增长。
