Livestock Can Thrive in Agricultural Regions
— A Survey of Livestock Production in Anqiu County
Lü Diànluò Xu Junjié

Located in the Shandong Peninsula Economic Open Area, Anqiu County has, in the process of adjusting and optimizing the rural industrial structure, made the development of livestock farming a strategic focus for the county's rural economy, achieving comprehensive development through livestock farming. Since 1984, the county's livestock farming income has grown at an annual rate of 22.6%. Last year, the total income from livestock farming reached 267 million yuan, accounting for 21.4% of the county's total rural economic income. This county with a population of one million, where agriculture is the main industry, has made livestock farming a key sector, with an average annual income of over 260 yuan per person from this sector alone, making it a key county for livestock farming in China.

Breaking Away from the Old Path of "Promoting Livestock with Grain"

Anqiu County covers an area of 2021 square kilometers, with mountains, hills, and plains each accounting for one-third. In recent years, the county's Party Committee and government have, based on local resource advantages, established a scientific and rational livestock farming production structure, proposing the guiding principle of "stabilizing grain-fed, expanding grass-fed, and developing export-oriented" livestock, which has yielded good results. They have focused on developing lean meat-type pigs and free-range pigs as the main direction for "stabilizing grain-fed" livestock. The county has invested 600,000 yuan to establish a lean meat-type pig breeding base service center, and each year provides interest-subsidized loans of over 500,000 yuan to mountainous towns to support the development of free-range pig farming. This alone saves the county over 6 million kilograms of grain each year.

To expand the breeding of grass-fed livestock and poultry, they have widely promoted technologies such as grinding, ensiling, and ammonia treatment for feed processing, and implemented the responsibility system for wasteland, barren hills, and barren beaches, developing and utilizing a large number of crop straw and aquatic grass resources. Last year, the county raised 850,000 rabbits, 1.5 million geese, 100,000 sheep, and 21,400 cattle, with a total output value of grass-fed livestock and poultry reaching over 28 million yuan.

Developing export-oriented livestock is about vigorously developing export-oriented livestock and poultry breeds, expanding the range of exported livestock products from just pork to include pigs, rabbits, chickens, cattle, minks, foxes, and more than 10 other breeds. In 1988, the county's livestock and poultry products earned 6.98 million US dollars in export revenue.

Implementing Appropriate Scale Farming

In Anqiu County's rural areas, the traditional scattered breeding methods of the past, such as "a basket of rice" and "chickens flying everywhere," have been replaced by new scientific breeding and management technologies. In recent years, the county has taken active measures to develop large-scale farming, achieving significant results. The county now has 607 specialized farming households, including 5 large-scale farmers with annual output values exceeding 100,000 yuan, and 110 specialized farming villages, forming 8 major production bases for meat chickens, egg-laying chickens, water minks, free-range pigs, rabbits, geese, and cattle.

With the expansion of farming scales, new breeding technologies such as compound feed, cage feeding, and rapid fattening have been widely adopted, improving the production level and economic benefits of livestock farming. In 1987, the Wang Yaomin Mink Farm in Fuhua Village, Linghe Town, created the "comprehensive mink farming method," which involves mainly raising minks while also raising chickens, pigs, and dairy cows. The farm uses broken eggs and chickens to feed the minks, and uses the minks' "leftover feed" to raise pigs and chickens, forming a food chain where various livestock and poultry depend on each other. Last year, the farm sold 7,000 mink furs, 200 fattened pigs, and 1,000 meat chickens, with a pure income of 360,000 yuan. The farming cost per mink was 20 yuan lower than that of ordinary mink farmers.

Creating a Good Development Environment

Firstly, support policies are implemented. The county has unified planning, starting from basic facilities, supporting the establishment of 22 breeding bases, 22 feed processing plants, and 20 livestock and poultry product processing plants; established and improved a three-level livestock and poultry disease prevention and control network and farming technology training system at the county, township, and village levels. Since 1986, the county has also supplied 20,000 tons of subsidized feed and issued 7.825 million yuan in interest-subsidized loans. Secondly, protection policies are implemented. For example, the county's food company has been maintaining a price ratio of 1:5 for pork and grain to set the minimum purchase price for live pigs, ensuring that farmers benefit from raising pigs.

    农区六畜也能兴
    ——安丘县畜牧业生产调查
    卢殿洛　徐俊杰
    位于山东半岛经济开放区的安丘县，在调整优化农村产业结构中，把发展畜牧业作为全县农村经济的战略重点，实现了以牧促农，全面发展。1984年以来，全县畜牧业收入以年均22.6％的速度增长，去年畜牧业总收入达2.67亿元，占全年农村经济总收入的21.4％。这个百万人口的农业大县，仅畜牧业一项，平均每人年收入就达260多元，成为我国农区畜牧业生产的重点县。
            冲出“以粮促牧”老路
    安丘县总面积2021平方公里，山区、丘岭、平原各占1／3。近年来，县委、县政府从当地资源优势出发，建立了科学合理的畜牧业生产结构，提出
  “稳定食粮的，扩大食草的，发展创汇的”指导方针，收到了良好效果。他们把发展高效节粮的瘦肉型猪和放养群猪作为“稳定食粮的”主攻方向，县里投资60万元，建起瘦肉型猪繁育基地服务总站，同时每年为山区乡镇提供贴息贷款50多万元，扶持发展群猪生产。仅此一项全县每年就节约粮食600多万公斤。
    为扩大食草畜禽的饲养，他们广泛推广粉碎、青贮、氨化等饲草加工技术，落实荒山、荒坡、荒滩承包责任制，使大批作物秸秆和水草资源得到开发利用。去年，全县饲养家兔85万只、鹅150万只、羊10万只、牛2.14万头，食草畜禽总产值达2800多万元。
    发展创汇的，就是大力发展出口创汇的畜禽品种，使出口畜产品由过去单纯的猪肉，发展到猪、兔、鸡、牛、貂、貉、狐等10多个品种。1988年全县畜禽产品出口创汇698万美元。
              实行适度规模养殖
    在安丘县农村，过去那种“一把米”、“满院飞”的分散饲养的传统方式已被科学饲养管理新技术所代替。近几年，全县采取积极措施，发展规模养殖大见成效。全县各类养殖专业户已发展到607个，其中有5个年产值在10万元以上的养殖大户，还出现了110个养殖专业村，已形成肉鸡、蛋鸡、水貂、群猪、家兔、鹅、牛等8大生产基地。
    随着饲养规模的扩大，新的饲养技术如配合饲料、笼式喂养、快速育肥等已被广泛采用，提高了畜牧业的生产水平和经济效益。1987年，凌河镇富家村王尧民养貂厂创造的“综合养貂法”，采取以貂为主，兼养鸡、猪、奶牛等畜禽，以残鸡、破蛋喂貂，以貂的“下脚饲料”养猪、喂鸡，构成各类畜禽相互依存的食物链。去年这个貂场出售貂皮7000张、肥猪200头、肉鸡1000只，纯收入36万元，每只貂的饲养成本比一般养貂户低20元。
    创造良好发展环境首先实行扶持政策。全县统一规划，从基本设施抓起，扶持建立22个良种繁育场、22处饲料加工厂和20处畜禽产品加工厂；建立健全了县、乡、村三级畜禽疫病防治网和养殖技术培训体系。1986年以来，全县还供应平价饲料2万多吨，发放贴息贷款782.5万元。其次是保护政策。如县食品公司近年来一直按猪粮一比五的比价制定生猪最低收购价，这样就保证了农民养猪有利可图。
                提供系列化服务
    安丘县在畜牧业生产中，发展了一批连结市场和农户的中间经济组织，这些中间组织大都以经济实体为依托，通过合同契约与农民建立稳固的经济关系，其内部设施齐全、自成体系，兼具组织生产等功能，为农民发展畜牧业生产提供系列服务。
    安丘县发展畜牧业生产的中间经济组织主要有四种类型：一是以加工企业为中心，通过横向联合形成企业群体。二是商业流通部门充当中间组织。三是不少乡、村根据畜禽生产的需要，自己建立了畜产品加工经营服务公司。四是事业部门实行企业化管理，形成服务实体。
