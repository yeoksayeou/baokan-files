    Song of the Washing Stream
    People say this is the home of the crane,
    What business does the rainbow have dancing by the lake?
    The sea water is beautiful, and we drink a thousand cups in joy.
    White City was once a world of sand,
    Now it is better than a granary,
    The Party and the people together write a new chapter.

    浣溪沙
    人言云是鹤家乡，
    湖滨底事舞霓裳？
    向海水美醉千觞。
    白城曾为沙世界，
    而今胜似米粮仓，
    党群协力谱新章。
