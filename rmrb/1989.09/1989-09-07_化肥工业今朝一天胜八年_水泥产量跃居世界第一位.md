Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 6th.

The chemical fertilizer, often referred to as the "food of food," has seen remarkable development in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic. Relevant departments have informed reporters that the current daily output of fertilizers in China is more than eight times the annual output of 1949. In 1988, the total national fertilizer production ranked third in the world.

Currently, China's fertilizer consumption has surged to the second position globally, with the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area exceeding the world average by more than twofold.

Our reporter Zhang Heping reports: Through nearly 40 years of effort by China's building materials industry workers, China's annual cement production has reached over 200 million tons, ranking first in the world. The development and production of cement varieties are at the international forefront.

According to Wang Yanmou, Director of the State Building Materials Bureau, in 1988, China's annual cement production reached over 203 million tons. Of this, one-third is mainly used in industrial, transportation, energy, and urban construction; two-thirds are mainly used in rural areas, such as agricultural water conservancy, roads and bridges, and peasant housing construction.
