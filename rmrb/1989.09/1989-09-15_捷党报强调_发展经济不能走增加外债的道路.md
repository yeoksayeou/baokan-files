	The Czech newspaper *Rudé právo* recently published an editorial emphasizing that Czechoslovakia's economic development should not rely on increasing foreign debt.

	The editorial criticizes some domestic voices that advocate for economic construction without personal effort, instead relying on Western loans. It points out that excessive borrowing will burden Czechoslovakia with heavy economic and political baggage, affecting economic development and the improvement of people's living standards.

	The editorial states that it does not oppose the use of foreign loans, but emphasizes that borrowing should be combined with increasing exports to Western countries. Advanced technology and techniques purchased with foreign exchange should be transformed into products that can be exported to Western capitalist countries, gradually expanding the scale of exports.

	The editorial points out that the funds needed for Czechoslovakia's economic development should be found through the rational use of existing economic strengths and the full exploitation of potential in various sectors.

	According to reports, by the end of last year, Czechoslovakia owed Western countries $6.7 billion in foreign debt, of which $3.8 billion was bank loans. In the first three years of the current five-year plan, foreign debt increased by $1.7 billion.

	However, some socialist countries and developing countries still owe Czechoslovakia a significant amount of debt. Currently, the amount of foreign exchange loans that Czechoslovakia provides to other countries exceeds the amount it borrows.

### 捷党报强调　发展经济不能走增加外债的道路

　　捷党报强调
　　发展经济不能走增加外债的道路
    最近捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》发表社论强调，捷发展经济不能走增加外债的道路。
    社论批评国内一些人进行经济建设不愿自己动手而想依靠西方贷款的观点，指出大量借债会使捷背上沉重的经济和政治包袱，影响经济发展和人民生活水平的提高。
    社论表示并不反对使用外国贷款，但是，借贷要同增加向西方出口产品结合起来，用外汇购进的先进技术和工艺应转化为能够向西方资本主义国家出口的产品，并逐步扩大出口的规模。
    社论指出，捷经济发展所需资金要从合理利用现有经济力量和充分挖掘各部门的潜力中去寻找。
    据报道，截止去年底，捷欠西方国家外债67亿美元，其中银行借贷38亿美元。
    在本5年计划的前3年，外债增加了17亿美元。
    但是，一些社会主义国家和发展中国家尚欠捷大笔债务。捷目前向国外提供的外汇贷款超过本国借贷的数目。
