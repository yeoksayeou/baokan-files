Marshal Nie recently wrote a letter to the University of Science and Technology of China, hoping that the entire faculty and student body will "revive the revolutionary spirit of science, restore the fine traditions of the University of Science and Technology, summarize the past, think about the future, and truly make the University of Science and Technology into the most advanced socialist institution of higher learning in science and technology."

At today's 31st anniversary celebration of the University of Science and Technology of China, the school leadership read this letter.

In his letter, Marshal Nie said: The University of Science and Technology has been established for 31 years and has trained a large number of qualified talents with both virtue and ability for the socialist construction of our country, which is highly welcomed by society and is a prestigious institution. However, in recent years, the University of Science and Technology has been disturbed by Fang Lizhi's bourgeois liberalization ideology, which has had a deep impact on the minds of some comrades. Now that Fang Lizhi's true colors have been exposed, the University of Science and Technology should focus on deeply exposing and criticizing him. Through the exposure and criticism of Fang Lizhi and others, we should raise everyone's awareness of adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. We are a socialist university, and the students we train should have a firm and correct socialist political direction.

The concern and expectations of the older generation of revolutionaries for the University of Science and Technology have deeply educated and inspired the leadership and faculty and staff of the University of Science and Technology. At today's anniversary celebration, President Gu Chaohao called on the entire faculty and student body to restore and carry forward the fine traditions of the University of Science and Technology, establish a grand revolutionary ideal, and establish a firm belief in striving for the prosperity and strength of the motherland for life. We must truly make the University of Science and Technology into the most advanced institution of higher learning in science and technology for socialism, and not disappoint the sincere expectations of the older generation of revolutionaries for the University of Science and Technology.

    聂帅寄语中国科大
    希望重振革命精神恢复优良传统
    新华社合肥9月20日电  （记者蒋志敏）聂荣臻元帅前不久写信给中国科技大学，希望全校师生“重振科大革命精神，恢复科大优良传统，总结过去，思考未来，把科大切实办成社会主义的最先进的高等科技学府”。
    在今天中国科技大学召开的校庆31周年大会上，校领导宣读了这封信。
    聂帅在信中说：科技大学成立已31年了，为我国的社会主义建设培养了大批德才兼备的合格人才，是深受社会欢迎的，是素有声望的学府。但近年来，科大被方励之的资产阶级自由化的思想所扰乱，在部分同志头脑里影响较深。现在方励之原形毕露，科大应着重对他进行深入的揭露和批判。要通过对方励之等人的揭露和批判，提高大家对坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的认识。我们是社会主义的大学，培养出的学生理应有坚定正确的社会主义政治方向。
    老一辈革命家对科大的关怀和厚望，使科大的领导和师生员工深受教育和鼓舞。在今天的校庆大会上，校长谷超豪要求全校师生恢复和发扬科大的优良传统，树立远大的革命理想，树立为祖国的繁荣昌盛奋斗终身的坚定信念，切实把科大办成社会主义的最先进的高等科技学府，不辜负老一辈革命家对科大的殷切期望。
