The 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship opened tonight at the Capital Gymnasium. The men's basketball teams from 15 countries and regions participating in this championship entered the venue one by one. As the national anthem of the People's Republic of China played, the flag of the Asian Basketball Federation and the Chinese national flag were raised. The chairman of the organizing committee, Wu Shouzhang, and the president of the Asian Basketball Federation, Cheng Wancui, delivered speeches at the opening ceremony.

In the A group match held after the opening ceremony, the defending champion China team defeated the Saudi Arabia team with a significant advantage of 102:72.

The Chinese men's basketball team fielded a new lineup combining both experienced and new players tonight. In the first 5 minutes of the game, China played cautiously, and the scores were close. Afterward, China changed tactics, increasing fast breaks and using man-to-man defense to suppress Saudi Arabia's inside game, gradually widening the score gap. At halftime, China led 57:37.

Since this is the first intercontinental competition the Chinese team has participated in since the Olympic Games, it has attracted much attention. In tonight's match, two new players on the Chinese team, 2-meter-tall Ma Jian and 2.02-meter-tall Gong Xiaobin, performed exceptionally well. They showcased their dunking and blocking skills multiple times, earning roaring applause and cheers from the audience. Although the Saudi team was weaker than the Chinese team, their three-point shooting accuracy was high.

The Asian Men's Basketball Championship is held every two years. Since China began participating in 1975, they have competed in 7 tournaments, winning 6 times. However, the current Chinese men's basketball team, which is in a transitional period, has seen its dominant position in the Asian basketball scene challenged.

In the B group match held this afternoon, South Korea defeated Iran with a score of 120:96.

Honorary Chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, Yu Qiu-li, as well as Zhang Bai-fa, Yuan Wei-min, and others attended the opening ceremony and watched the match.

　　第十五届亚洲男篮锦标赛开幕
　　中国队首战轻取沙特阿拉伯队
    本报北京9月15日讯　记者陈昭报道：第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛开幕式今晚在首都体育馆举行。参加本届锦标赛的15个国家和地区的男篮依次入场。在中华人民共和国的国歌声中，亚洲篮联的会旗和中国国旗冉冉升起。本届组委会主任吴寿章和亚洲篮球联合会会长程万琦在开幕式上致词。
    在开幕式后进行的A组比赛中，上届冠军中国队以102∶72的较大优势战胜了沙特阿拉伯队。
    中国男篮今晚排出的是新老结合的阵容。开场前5分钟，中国队打得比较拘谨，双方比分咬得很紧。此后，中国队改变战术，一方面加强了快攻，另一方面用盯人联防遏制了沙特队的内线，逐渐将比分拉大，上半时中国队以57∶37领先。
    由于这是中国队自奥运会后大换血以来参加的首次洲际比赛，因此引起人们的关注。在今晚的比赛中，中国队两名新人，身高2米的马健和身高2米02的巩晓彬表现出色，他们多次演出扣篮和“盖帽”的技艺，引来全场观众的阵阵掌声和喝采。沙特队尽管实力逊于中国队，但他们的远投命中率甚高。
    亚洲男篮锦标赛每两年举行一次，中国队自1975年参加开始，共参加了7届比赛，其中6次夺标，但是目前处于调整时期的中国男篮，在亚洲篮坛的霸主地位已受到猛烈冲击。
    在今天下午进行的B组比赛中，南朝鲜队以120∶96战胜伊朗队。
    中国篮球协会名誉主席余秋里以及张百发、袁伟民等出席了开幕式并观看了比赛。
