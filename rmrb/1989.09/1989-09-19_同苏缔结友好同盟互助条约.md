During the winter of 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong visited the Soviet Union and proposed to Stalin that the two countries sign a new treaty to replace the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed between the Soviet government and the Kuomintang government. The Soviet side agreed. The two sides signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance" on February 14, 1950, with a validity period of 30 years.

The main contents of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance" are as follows: "In the event that one of the contracting parties is invaded by Japan or a country allied with Japan, and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other contracting party shall provide military and other assistance to the fullest extent of its ability"; "Neither of the contracting parties shall conclude any alliance directed against the other, nor shall it join any bloc or take any action or measures directed against the other"; "The two parties shall, in the interest of consolidating peace and universal security, consult with each other on all major international issues concerning the common interests of the two countries"; "The two parties shall, on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, develop and consolidate economic and cultural ties between the two countries, provide each other with all possible economic assistance, and carry out necessary economic cooperation."

Under the historical conditions at that time, the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance" was of great significance in safeguarding the security of both parties, maintaining peace in the Far East and the world, and strengthening the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and promoting the socialist construction of the two countries. For a period of time after the signing of the treaty, China and the Soviet Union had close friendly relations, with mutual support and cooperation in the political arena, and mutual cooperation in the economic and cultural fields.

　　同苏缔结友好同盟互助条约
    1949年冬毛泽东主席访苏时，向斯大林建议两国签订一项新的条约，以代替1945年苏联政府与中国国民党政府签订的《中苏友好同盟条约》。苏联方面表示同意。双方于1950年2月14日缔结了《中苏友好同盟互助条约》，有效期30年。
    《中苏友好同盟互助条约》的主要内容是：“一旦缔约国一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵略，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助”；“缔约国双方均不缔结反对对方的任何同盟，并不参加反对对方的任何集团及任何行动或措施”；“双方根据巩固和平和普遍安全的利益，对有关中苏两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题，均将进行彼此磋商”；“双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵守平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化联系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。”
    在当时的历史条件下，《中苏友好同盟互助条约》的缔结对保障双方的安全，维护远东和世界的和平以及加强中苏两国人民的友谊和促进两国的社会主义建设事业，都有重要的意义。条约签订后一段时间内，中苏两国有过密切的友好关系，在政治上相互配合和支持，在经济、文化领域互相合作。
