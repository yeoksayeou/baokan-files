The General Departments of the People's Liberation Army today jointly issued a circular to commend the troops that have supported local disaster relief efforts. The circular from the General Staff Department, the General Political Department, and the General Logistics Department said that this year, some regions in China have experienced fires, earthquakes, and especially since the summer, severe floods in some areas. Troops stationed in these regions have carried forward the fine tradition of wholeheartedly serving the people, bravely participating in disaster relief, and making outstanding contributions to protecting national property and the safety of people's lives. Preliminary statistics show that the entire army has dispatched over 80,000 personnel, more than 20,000 vehicles and machinery, and over 80 aircraft and ships. They have rescued and relocated over 350,000 people in danger, with 15 soldiers sacrificing their lives to protect national and people's property.

The circular said that this year, the troops have participated in major natural disasters including the earthquake in Batang, Sichuan, floods along the Yangtze River in six provinces and parts of Northeast China, a major forest fire in the Hemaqugou Forest Farm in Inner Mongolia, and the oil depot fire in Huangdao, Qingdao, Shandong. During the disaster relief efforts, leaders at all levels of the troops have personally gone to the front lines, carefully commanded, and organized meticulously. The soldiers have rushed to the most severely affected and dangerous areas, risking their lives without hesitation.

The circular requires all troops to learn from the disaster relief troops who always prioritize the interests of the state and the people, and are willing to sacrifice their lives to protect national property and people's safety. It also calls for learning their fearlessness, perseverance, and revolutionary heroism, as well as their strict adherence to commands, integrity, and high sense of organizational discipline. The circular urges all troops to make new contributions to defending and building socialist modernization.
