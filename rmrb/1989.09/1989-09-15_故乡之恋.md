Title: Longing for Home

	You are the cradle in which I nestle in my dreams, the deck on which I stand when I venture far, the inn that I yearn for when I am weary, the garden that inspires me when I write... In the vast sea, you make me yearn with all my might.

	On the peak of towering mountains, you make me eager to return home. Whether I am in a foreign land or a stranger in a strange place, hearing of you often makes unfamiliar faces seem warm, often shortens the distance between hearts.

	Though my youthful vigor swells my chest, the tears of homesickness sometimes flow like the quiet rain in the alleys of the south. Plants have spirits, and humans have deep emotions and worries. Longing is like an arrow, both tender and resolute.

	I reminisce about the warm feelings of home. I search for the traces of home. In the journey of hardship, in the sincere hospitality of simple meals, in the honest wrinkles of a brow. In the cold and aimless days, how should I write about the passionate years I long for!

	Home, your simplicity and sincerity, whether in the past or in the future, should be like the full bloom of flowers, like the ripples of green waves, like the rising sun.

	Ah, the home that belongs to you, to her, and to me.

　　故乡之恋
　　郑一
    是我睡梦时依偎的摇篮，是我远涉时伫立的甲板，是我疲惫时焦盼的客店，是我笔耕时灵感的田园……
    茫茫的大海之中，你让我望眼欲穿。
    高高的大山之巅，你令我归心似箭。
    或是置于他乡，或是身为异客。谛听聆听到你呵，往往会使多少陌生的面孔增添亲热，往往会让多少心灵的距离缩短许多。
    尽管血气方刚的颅腔，挺起胸膛，可乡思的泪眼，有时如同江南幽深的雨巷。
    草木有灵，人生也有衷肠愁思。思念是一支箭，有缠绵，更有刚毅。
    我追忆温馨的乡情。
    我寻觅着乡情的踪迹。
    在含辛茹苦的旅程上，在粗茶淡饭的热诚中，在憨实厚朴的额纹里。在冷漠徘徊的日子，向往热情奔放的岁月，又该怎样去书写你！
    乡情，你的纯朴和真挚，无论是在千秋，或者是万代之中，都应当如同饱满的花期，如同碧波的涟漪，如同喷薄的朝曦。
    呵，属于你，属于她，也属于我的乡情。
