The autumn of 1950.

In Zhongnanhai, Mao Zedong's bedroom.

On the writing desk lay a telegram from the Volunteer Army Headquarters in the Korean front, personally drafted by Commander Peng Dehuai. Chairman:

This morning, our "Volunteer Headquarters" command post was heavily bombed by enemy planes. Hong Xuezhi and Mao Anying escorted me to a safe area. Later, Anying returned to the command post to retrieve the battle map. In the chaos, we couldn't stop him, resulting in his being hit by an enemy plane's incendiary bomb. The chairman's beloved son, our good staff officer at the "Volunteer Headquarters," Anying comrade, sacrificed his life for the people's cause...

From the moment this telegram was received, Mao Zedong did not speak a single word for an entire day, only smoking one cigarette after another. The meals on the table had been reheated several times but remained untouched. Anying was his most beloved eldest son, the fruit of his love with his wife Yang Kaihui. In those days, underground party comrades risked their lives to find Anying and bring the child to him. Later, he arranged for Anying to study in the Soviet Union. After graduating from a university abroad, he personally sent his beloved son to the countryside to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Each time they parted, little Anying would bounce back to his side. But this time, how could it be...

"Anying! Anying!" The chairman, with his index finger pinching his tightly furrowed brows, couldn't help but murmur.

"Chairman," the secretary entered and said softly, "General Peng has telegraphed, saying Anying is the chairman's eldest son, requesting an exception to bring the body back to the country."

The secretary leaned closer to the chairman and said softly, "Kim Il-sung, the prime minister of North Korea, has also telegraphed to express his condolences. He said Anying comrade sacrificed his life for the liberation cause of the Korean people and is also a son of the Korean people. He requests that Anying be buried in Korea."

The chairman looked up at the ceiling, holding back his sorrow, his eyes filled with endless affection. When Anying went to Korea, he was too busy with work to see him off, and who would have thought it would be a final farewell! "My son is alive and we can't see each other, so let me see his body!" The chairman thought. But this idea quickly vanished. He seemed to console himself by saying, "My son is dead, and I am certainly sad, but in war, people must die. On the Korean battlefield, how many of our excellent children have sacrificed their lives? Their parents must also be sad. They must also want to see their son's remains one last time... Anying is my son, but he is also a son of the Korean people. Let's respect the wishes of the Korean people."

In the moment the secretary handed the draft to the chairman for his signature, the chairman hesitated unconsciously. His expression clearly said, "Anying really isn't here anymore? Father and son really can't see each other again?" The chairman's gloomy gaze turned to the window, his right hand pointing to the writing desk, instructing the secretary to place the draft on it.

The next morning, the secretary came to Mao Zedong's bedroom. Mao Zedong had already left, and on the pillow lay the telegram draft with a line of bold characters: Loyal bones are buried under every green mountain, why must we wrap the body in horse leather to return it?

Under the telegram draft was a handkerchief soaked with tears.

    青山处处埋忠骨
    1950年秋。
    中南海，毛泽东卧室。
    写字台上，放着一封从朝鲜前线志愿军司令部发来的、由司令员彭德怀亲自拟定的电报。主席勋鉴：
    今晨，我“志司”指挥部遭敌机狂轰滥炸，洪学智、毛岸英将我送入安全地域。尔后，岸英又返回指挥所取作战地图。慌中未能劝住他，致使被敌机的汽油弹击中。主席的爱子，我们“志司”的好参谋，岸英同志为了人民的事业光荣殉职……
    从收到这封电报起，毛泽东整整一天没说一句话，只是一支又一支地吸着烟。桌子上的饭菜已经热了几遍，还是原封不动地放在那里。岸英是他最心爱的长子，是他和结发妻子杨开慧爱情的结晶。当年地下党的同志们冒着生命的危险找到了岸英，把孩子送到他身边。后来他安排岸英去苏联留学。在国外的大学毕业后，他又亲自把爱子送到农村去，走与工农相结合的道路。那一次次的分离，小岸英不都是活蹦欢跳地回到自己的身边来了吗！这次怎么会……
      “岸英！岸英！”主席用食指夹着紧锁的眉宇，情不自禁地喃喃着。
      “主席，”秘书进来，小声说：“彭老总来电，说岸英是主席的长子，要求破格将遗体运回国。”
    秘书又凑近主席，轻声说：“朝鲜金日成首相来电，向主席表示安慰，他说岸英同志是为朝鲜人民的解放事业而牺牲的，也是朝鲜人民的儿子，他要求把岸英葬在朝鲜。”
    主席仰起头望着天花板，强忍着心中悲痛，目光中流露出无限的眷恋深情。岸英赴朝鲜时，他因工作忙，未能见上一面，谁知竟成了永别！“儿子活着不能相见，就让我见见遗体吧！”主席想到。然而这种想法很快消失了。他像是自慰地说道：“我的儿子死了，我当然很悲痛，可是，战争嘛，总要死人的。朝鲜战场上我们有多少优秀儿女献出了生命，他们的父母难道就不悲痛吗？他们就不想再见上一面儿子的遗容吗……岸英是我的儿子，也是朝鲜人民的儿子，就尊重朝鲜人民的意见吧。”
    秘书将记录稿交主席签名的一瞬间，主席下意识地踌躇了一阵，那神情分明在说，岸英难道真的不在了？父子真的不得相见了？主席暗然的目光转向窗外，右手指指写字台，示意秘书将电稿放在上面。
    第二天早上，秘书来到毛泽东的卧室。毛泽东已经出去了，放在枕头上的电文稿写着一行醒目的大字：青山处处埋忠骨，何须马革裹尸还。
    电文稿下是一片被泪水打湿的枕巾。
