Recently, the renting of private homes has become common in some areas. Some lawbreakers have even used rented private homes as their bases to engage in activities such as receiving stolen goods, selling stolen goods, and other criminal activities.

On February 26 this year, our bureau cracked a case of burglary. The criminal Zhang rented a private room in Wanjun Village, Tiesheng Township of our district and illegally cohabited with a young woman. Zhang also colluded with others to openly steal residents' color televisions, washing machines, suitcases, and other items. On the evening of June 1 this year, a farmer named Yu Shunjun from Limin Village, Gounan Township of Fangzheng County was caught red-handed while planning to commit a crime in our district. After interrogation, he confessed that since last winter, after roaming our city, he rented a private room. He had illicit relations with four young women and committed multiple thefts. In the private room he rented, he openly displayed the color televisions, tape recorders, bicycles, and other items he had stolen.

We suggest that relevant departments establish a registration system for landlords and tenants and strengthen the management of rented houses to plug loopholes.

　　警惕不法分子租私房作案
    近来，一些地方私房出租普遍，个别违法犯罪分子竟以租借的私房为落脚点，进行收赃、销赃和其它犯罪活动。
    今年二月二十六日，我局破获一起入室盗窃案。犯罪分子张某在我区铁锋乡宛屯村租了一间私房，与一女青年非法同居。张某还伙同他人，公开偷盗居民的彩电、洗衣机、皮箱等。今年六月一日晚，方正县沟南乡黎明村农民于顺军在我区伺机作案时，被抓获。经审讯，他供认从去年冬流窜我市后，租了一间私房，先后同四名女青年乱搞两性关系，并盗窃作案多起。在他租用的私房内，公开摆设着他盗来的彩电、录音机、自行车等物。
    建议有关部门建立房主、房客登记制度，切实加强对出租房屋的管理，堵塞漏洞。
