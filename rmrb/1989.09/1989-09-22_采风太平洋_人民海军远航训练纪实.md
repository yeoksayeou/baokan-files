Crossing the Pacific
- A Record of the People's Navy's Long-Distance Training

Beyond the yellow waters, through the green waters, and into the blue ocean, the People's Navy, a fleet composed of surface ships, submarines, comprehensive supply ships, and aircraft, sets sail with a horn blast.

Where are they heading?—The Pacific Ocean.

The vast and mysterious Pacific Ocean has, for a long time, been the stage for military exercises by countries like the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and Japan. Chinese warships have never set foot there.

Today, the gates of the Pacific Ocean should be open to China!

Our young People's Navy, after decades of development, has grown from nothing to something, from small to large. It has evolved from the initial single-branch force to a multi-branch force including surface ships, submarines, naval aviation, coastal defense, and marine corps. The equipment has gradually developed from repairing old ships, importing and purchasing, manufacturing through transfer of technology, imitation, and improvement, to independent research and production. It is now moving towards missile, electronic, nuclear, and automated development. The aviation forces are also transitioning from general-purpose shore-based aircraft to naval specialized aircraft, establishing a multi-type aviation force including bombers, fighters, attack aircraft, helicopters, transport aircraft, and seaplanes. The Chinese Navy is capable of venturing into the open sea.

The long-distance fleet is advancing.

Relying on advanced navigation equipment, it is like an arrow leaving the bow, day and night, straight into the Pacific Ocean.

Soon, foreign newspapers commented: "The Chinese Navy has previously only operated in coastal waters, and it is rare to see it conducting formal exercises in the open sea. The Chinese Navy is advancing towards modernization at a speed exceeding Western estimates."

Internationally, there is a distinction between yellow-water, green-water, and blue-water navies. Yellow-water refers to operations only in coastal waters, green-water symbolizes the ability to venture into the open sea, and blue-water indicates the navy can sail globally. Regardless of the scientific validity of this classification, the action of the People's Navy long-distance fleet heading to the open sea has already shown: the Chinese Navy will definitely break out of the yellow waters, cross the green waters, and sail towards the blue waters, leaving its tracks on the Pacific Ocean without any inferiority.

A major combat exercise involving blockade and counter-blockade, breakthrough and counter-breakthrough, ship-to-ship and ship-to-air confrontation pushed the long-distance training to its peak.

Underwater, submarines appeared and disappeared; on the surface, surface ships chased and fought; in the air, aircraft broke through clouds and fog, coming and going like shuttles. For a moment, the sea and sky were filled with lightning and thunder, and sea dragons emerged from the water.

Suddenly, several warships sent a "request for supply" signal.

The "logistics officer" responded promptly. A large comprehensive supply ship sailed among several ships, using the automatic cable machine installed on the ship to connect oil pipes and water pipes with various ships, simultaneously supplying several ships. Look, the medical department is also using aerial cables to conduct injured personnel transportation experiments!

Indeed, we finally have our own open-sea supply ships. In the past, our ships could only sail in coastal waters due to the lack of timely supplies. Now, the People's Navy has initially established a sea-based support system, with hundreds of various service vessels, and the tonnage has increased nearly tenfold compared to a decade ago. Several large open-sea supply ships are respectively in service in the Bohai Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, providing reliable support for the navy's long-distance training.

A tense yet orderly sea supply battle ended. Ship after ship refueled with fuel, fresh water, and vegetables, and are now advancing at full speed, breaking through the waves.

    采风太平洋
    ——人民海军远航训练纪实
    越黄水，穿绿水，向蓝色海域驰骋。
    人民海军一支由水面舰艇、潜艇、综合补给船、飞机组成的海上编队，鸣笛离港。
    向何处去？——太平洋。
    太平洋浩瀚而诡谲，在过去相当长一段时间里，世界上只有美、苏、英、日等几个国家到此列阵演兵，中国军舰还不曾光顾过。
    今天，太平洋的大门，该是向中国开放的时候了！
    我们年轻的人民海军，经过几十年的建设，从无到有，从小到大，已从初建时期的单一兵种，发展成为一支拥有水面舰艇、潜艇、海军航空兵、海军岸防兵和海军陆战队等诸兵种合成的军种。装备逐步从过去修复旧船改装、外购引进、转让制造、仿制改进，发展到自行研制生产，现正向导弹化、电子化、核能化、自动化建设的方向发展。航空兵部队也正在从岸基通用飞机向海军专用飞机发展，并建立起一支拥有轰炸、歼击、强击、直升、运输、水上飞机等多机种的航空兵部队。中国海军有能力涉足大洋。
    远航编队在前进。
    它凭着先进的导航设备，似离弦之箭，日夜兼程，直插太平洋。
    很快，国外的报纸评论说：“中国海军过去只是在沿岸区域活动，到远洋进行正式演习还很少看到过。中国海军正以超过西方估计的速度推进现代化。”
    国际上有黄水、绿水、蓝水海军之说。黄水即仅在近海活动，绿水象征有能力闯进大洋，而蓝水说明海军可环球游弋。不论这种划分是否科学，我人民海军远航编队奔向远洋的行动已经表明：中国海军一定能够走出黄水、越过绿水、驶向蓝水，将航迹毫无逊色地镂刻在太平洋上。
    一场封锁与反封锁、突破与反突破、舰舰与舰空对抗的主体作战演习，把远航训练推向高潮。
    水下，潜艇神出鬼没；水上，水面舰艇追逐格杀；空中，飞机破雾穿云，往来如梭。一时间，海空电闪雷鸣，海面蛟龙出水。
    突然，几艘军舰发出“请求补给”的信号。
      “粮草官”有求必应。一艘大型综合补给船航行在几艘舰中间，通过安装在船上的自动缆索机，把油管、水管与各舰相互接通，同时给几艘舰“喂奶”。瞧，医疗部门还借助空中缆索进行运送伤员试验呢！
    是啊，我们终于有了自己的远洋补给船。在过去的日子里，我们的舰艇出海由于得不到及时补给，只能围着近海打转转。现在，人民海军已初步建立起海上保障体系，各类勤务船只数百艘，吨位比10年前增加近10倍。若干艘大型远洋补给船分别服役在北海、东海和南海，为海军远航训练提供了可靠的保障。
    一场紧张而有序的海上补给战结束了。一艘艘军舰补足了燃料、淡水和蔬菜，正开足马力，破浪前进。　（胡春华）
