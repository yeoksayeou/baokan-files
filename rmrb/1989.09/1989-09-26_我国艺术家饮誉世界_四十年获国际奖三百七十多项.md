Since the founding of the People's Republic, Chinese artists have participated in 166 international art competitions, with 554 individuals winning 376 awards. Among these, 218 awards were won in the past 10 years. The Ministry of Culture held a ceremony in Beijing today to honor 92 artists who have won awards in the past two years.

Acrobats are at the forefront today, with 56 individuals receiving awards. The most awarded artists are musicians, who have won 100 awards in the past 10 years. This includes 54 awards for string instruments, 26 for vocal performances, 13 for piano, and 7 for popular songs, making the international music community take notice and re-evaluate the Chinese music scene.

The Chinese ballet, with a development history of only 35 years, has made remarkable strides. In the past 10 years, 37 ballet dancers have won 27 awards, including 9 gold medals.

Vice Minister of Culture Gao Zhanxiang, while honoring the artists, also paid tribute on behalf of the Ministry of Culture to the directors, composers, teachers, coaches, accompanists, and relevant unit leaders who have nurtured these artists.

During today's ceremony, some award-winning performers also showcased their winning performances. Among them, the 7-year-old He Jia and 11-year-old Tian Yong from the Nanjing Acrobatics Troupe performed the act "Plate Spinning" for which they won the highest award, the "President's Award," at the 12th "Tomorrow" and the 3rd "Future" International Circus and Acrobatics Festival. As they stepped off the stage, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Hab Zhuming, Apu Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Kang Keqing, and Ma Wenrui embraced them. The scene was captured by television cameras and photographers.
