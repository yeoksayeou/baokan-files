The table tennis team competition began in Fushun City. The men's teams from Heilongjiang, Tianjin, Shandong, and Sichuan fought hard in nine matches to advance to the next round.

In their first game, the Liaoning team paid the price with five yellow cards and several players collapsing from cramps, but still lost 2-3 to the Guangdong team. The Beijing team defeated Shanghai 4-2. In another group, the Tianjin team won 3-1 against Henan.

    在辽阳游泳馆进行的8项游泳决赛中，奥运会银牌获得者、上海名将庄泳轻而易举地摘取青运会游泳决赛第一枚金牌，她的100米自由泳成绩是55秒68。她的队友杨文意以58秒60的成绩排在该项决赛第三名，广西16岁的何晓云以58秒15获得亚军。上海队胡征宇以1分06秒16获男子100米蛙泳冠军。去年城运会上8次夺冠的广东姑娘杨迅以5分02秒01的成绩取得女子400米个人混合泳第一名。

    抚顺市承办的乒乓球赛开始了团体赛。黑龙江、天津、山东和四川男队苦战9盘才闯过第一关。相比之下，世界冠军邓亚萍挂帅的河南女队就显得轻松多了，她们和北京、河北、湖北、江苏、辽宁队一道，成为首轮得胜的女队。
