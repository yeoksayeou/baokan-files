Comrade Wu Xinyu, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a seasoned communist warrior, a revolutionary of the proletariat, a legal scholar, and one of the outstanding leaders of China's political and legal front, former member of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China, and special advisor to the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress, passed away in Beijing on September 3, 1989, at 3:30 PM due to a sudden heart attack and failed rescue efforts. He was 83 years old.

Comrade Wu Xinyu, formerly known as Wu Jie and Wu Hansan, was born in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, in 1906. In 1923, he enrolled in Beijing Normal University. During his studies, he accepted Marxism-Leninism and joined the Communist Youth League in early 1925, followed by the Communist Party of China. He served as a member of the West City District Committee of the Communist Party of Beijing and a member of the Party Branch of the Normal University, leading student work under the Party's guidance and beginning his revolutionary career. After graduating from university in 1927, he taught at various schools such as Kaifeng Normal School, Tongzhou Girls' School, and Taigu Chengcheng Middle School. He successively served as the secretary of the Education Workers' Union of Beijing and Taiyuan, and a member of the Party Group of the Cultural Federation of Beijing. He was one of the early Party members who spread revolutionary truths and conducted communist enlightenment education among students. Under his influence, a large number of young people embarked on the revolutionary path. After the "September 18 Incident" in 1931, he participated in the Anti-Japanese Anti-Imperialist Alliance in Taiyuan in 1932, organizing and leading the Anti-Japanese Anti-Imperialist Alliance. In 1933, due to his revolutionary activities, he was pursued by Yan Xishan and had to leave, going to Japan to study and taking charge of the work of overseas students. After returning to China in 1934, he taught at the Republic University in Beijing, served as the secretary of the Beijing Education Federation, and a member of the Party Group of the Cultural Federation. He participated in the Beijing Cultural Salvation Association and actively engaged in anti-Japanese and national salvation activities. From the time he joined the revolution, Comrade Wu Xinyu was engaged in revolutionary activities under the white terror of the Beiyang warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Under extremely difficult conditions, he used teaching as a cover to unremittingly fight against the reactionary regime.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Wu Xinyu was dispatched by the Party to Shanxi, where he served as the deputy director of the Mobilization Department of the War Zone General Committee, a member of the Party Group, the director of the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Area Work Committee, the secretary of the Communist Party of the Daqing Mountain Special Committee, and the director of the Propaganda Department of the Shui Province Committee. In 1939, he went to Yan'an to serve as the secretary of Chairman Mao's office. In 1942, he returned to Jin-Sui to serve as the deputy director and director of the Border Administrative Office, the secretary of the Party Group, a standing member of the Jin-Sui Bureau, and also served as the president of Chengcheng Academy. Throughout the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Wu Xinyu mainly worked in the Jin-Sui region on united front work, base area construction, and government work. During this period, he mobilized manpower and resources to support the frontline, making important contributions to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Together with Comrade Li Pingyuan, he established the Daqing Mountain Anti-Japanese Base Area in the heart of the pseudo-Mengjiang region, devoting all his efforts to the political construction of the Jin-Sui region. He cared for the growth of the youth and cultivated a large number of young and capable cadres for our Party.

During the War of Liberation, he went to the newly liberated Jinan region to serve as the director of the Jinan Administrative Office and the secretary of the Jinan Work Committee, vigorously carrying out land reform, eliminating traitors and tyrants, and restoring production. This fundamentally changed the face of the region and made due contributions to the victory of the War of Liberation.

On the eve of the founding of the nation, he participated in the First National Political Consultative Conference.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Wu Xinyu served as the deputy minister and deputy secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of the Interior, assisting Comrade Xie Juecheng in managing the work of the Ministry of the Interior. He did a great deal of pioneering work in the construction of grassroots political power and in disaster relief and welfare. In 1953, he served as the secretary and secretary of the Party Group of the State Council's Political and Legal Committee. He was a representative of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth National People's Congresses, a member of the Second, Third, and Fourth Standing Committees of the National People's Congress, a deputy secretary and secretary of the Standing Committee's Party Group, and a member of the National People's Congress. For a long period, he presided over the daily work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, working meticulously and diligently. He participated in the formulation of the Organic Law of the National People's Congress, the Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees, the Organic Law of the People's Courts, and the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates. He personally drafted the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China. He played an important role in the development of the people's congress system and socialist legal system in our country.

In 1956, Comrade Wu Xinyu attended the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China as a non-voting delegate.

During the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Wu Xinyu suffered severe persecution from Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, but he remained steadfast in his communist beliefs and always trusted the Party and the people. After the Gang of Four was smashed, he was elected as a representative of the Fifth National People's Congress and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He wholeheartedly supported the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. He successively served as the deputy secretary-general, deputy director and secretary of the Legal Committee, and director of the Legal Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the secretary of the Party Group of the National People's Congress, a member of the Central Political and Legal Committee, the first president of the China Law Society, and a special advisor to the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress. He participated in the revision and formulation of the Constitution, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, General Principles of Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law, Marriage Law, Nationality Law, and Environmental Protection Law, making significant contributions to strengthening and improving socialist legal system in the new period.

Comrade Wu Xinyu was a representative of the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a standing member of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and a member of the Central Advisory Commission.

Comrade Wu Xinyu's life was a revolutionary one. During his student days, he eagerly pursued revolutionary truths and was one of the early Party members. He possessed a strong sense of party spirit and, for decades, devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Party's work. Under any difficult conditions, he never slackened or wavered, remaining infinitely loyal to the Party's cause. He consistently aligned with the Party Central Committee, adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, supported reform and opening up, and resolutely supported the decisions to build socialist material and spiritual civilization. He resolutely supported the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. He was diligent and conscientious in his work, dedicating all his efforts to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of socialism. He was always strict with himself, frugal, honest, and selfless, never calculating personal gains and losses in the face of positions, honors, and treatment. He had an upright style, was open and aboveboard, approachable, cared for and protected his comrades, and was good at working with his comrades. He possessed the noble morals and revolutionary spirit of an outstanding Communist Party member.

The passing of Comrade Wu Xinyu is a great loss to us, as we have lost a loyal communist warrior. We must turn our grief into strength, learn from his revolutionary spirit, carry on his unfinished work, and, under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, with economic construction as the center, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and carry out reform and opening up. We must strive to build our country into a modern socialist power.
