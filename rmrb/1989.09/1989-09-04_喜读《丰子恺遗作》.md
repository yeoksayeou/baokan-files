Recently, I had the pleasure of reading "Feng Zikai's Posthumous Works," a large-scale collection of calligraphy and paintings published by Huaxia Press, following their previous work, "The Calligraphy of Master Hongyi." I am extremely delighted.

Feng Zikai (1898–1975) was a renowned artist in modern China. Since the 1920s, his works such as "Zikai Cartoons" and "Random Notes from Yuan Yuan Tang" have been highly regarded in the cultural and artistic circles. His cartoons, in particular, are beloved by the youth. The name Feng Zikai is familiar to anyone over the age of sixty or seventy. Although he did not attend university, his academic achievements are a testament to his self-made success. His artistic accomplishments are not only celebrated in China but also appreciated in Japan.

As early as the 1940s, the renowned Japanese sinologist Ichikawa Kojiro translated his "Random Notes from Yuan Yuan Tang." In his "Translator's Note," Ichikawa wrote: "I find the author, Feng Zikai, to be the most artistic of modern Chinese artists. This is not because he is multitalented, playing the piano, drawing cartoons, and writing essays. What I admire is his genuine simplicity as an artist, his rich love for all things, and his character and demeanor." These words are truly fitting for Mr. Feng.

Looking at the evaluations of several famous figures in modern China, such as Ye Shengtao, Zheng Zhenduo, Zhu Ziqing, Zhu Guangqian, and Ba Jin, they all have high praise for his character, scholarship, and art. Zhu Guangqian's "Feng Zikai's Character and Art" states: "Master Hongyi is Feng Zikai's teacher, and in many ways, Feng Zikai benefited greatly from this teacher. His interests in music, painting, literature, and calligraphy, as well as his character and demeanor, are quite similar to Master Hongyi." Feng Zikai himself said: "Master Hongyi is my teacher in art and my guide in religion. My life has been greatly influenced by him. Master Hongyi, then known as Li Shutong, was my teacher in painting and music. He was humble in his demeanor. However, every student truly admired him, and I was one of them. My admiration for him was greater than that of others. Perhaps my temperament is somewhat similar to Mr. Li's, and I like everything he likes." (Feng Zikai, "Me and Master Hongyi").

The arrangement and binding of this book are similar to "The Calligraphy of Master Hongyi." The entire book is divided into six parts: cartoons, landscapes, poetry and calligraphy, music and bookbinding, seals, essays, and a timeline, all carefully selected from Feng Zikai's extensive posthumous works by the editors. The editors say: "He (Mr. Feng) has studied painting, music, literature, calligraphy, seals, architecture, bookbinding, crafts, drama, and photography, covering various fields in the art world. He delves deeply into the essence of each, creating a unique style that is fresh, natural, appropriate, and harmonious." I completely agree with these comments.

This book can be seen as a reflection of Feng Zikai's various achievements. The effort put in by the editors is commendable. Such a beautifully crafted large-scale collection of calligraphy and paintings, published by Huaxia Press with meticulous attention to detail, is indeed a great contribution to Chinese culture and art. I believe its publication will certainly be appreciated and admired by readers both at home and abroad! (Accompanying images)

    喜读《丰子恺遗作》
    林子青
    近日读到华夏出版社继《弘一法师遗墨》之后，又一本大型书画册《丰子恺遗作》，极为欣喜。
    丰子恺先生（1898—1975）是我国近代著名的艺术家，自20年代以来即以《子恺漫画》和《缘缘堂随笔》等为文化艺术界所瞩目。他的漫画尤为一般青年所喜爱。丰子恺的名字，今天六七十岁以上的人恐怕没有不知道的。他并未上过大学，从他的学术成就看来，真可说是自学成材的典型人物。他的艺术造诣，不但驰名于我国，在日本也是很有知音的。
    早在40年代，日本著名汉学家吉川幸次郎博士即翻译过他的《缘缘堂随笔》。吉川在他的《译者的话》中说：“我觉得著者丰子恺，是现代中国最像艺术家的艺术家。这并不是因为他多才多艺，会弹钢琴、作漫画、写随笔的缘故，我所喜欢的，乃是他的像艺术家的真率，对于万物的丰富的爱，和他的气质、品格。”（见日本作家谷崎润一郎所作，夏丐尊译的《读缘缘堂随笔》）这些评语对丰先生来说可谓当之无愧。
    再看看我国近代几位名家，如叶圣陶、郑振铎、朱自清、朱光潜、巴金等的评论，对他的人品学识和艺术，也是有定评的。朱光潜的
  《丰子恺的人品与画品》说：“弘一法师是子恺的先生，在许多地方，子恺得益于这位老师的都很大。他的音乐、图画、文学、书法的趣味，他的品格风采，都颇近于弘一。”丰子恺自己也说：“弘一法师是我学艺术的教师，又是我信宗教的导师。我的一生受法师的影响很大。弘一法师那时称李叔同先生，便是我的图画音乐教师。……他态度谦虚。然而个个学生真心地崇拜他，我便是其中之一人。而我的崇拜他甚于其他人。大约是我的气质与李先生有点相似，凡是他所欢喜的，我都欢喜。”（丰子恺《我与弘一法师》）。
    本书的编排装帧与《弘一大师遗墨》相同。全书内容共分：漫画、风景画、诗词书翰、音乐装帧金石、随笔及年表六个部分，都是编者从丰子恺先生庞大的遗作中精选出来的。编者说：“他（子恺先生）对绘画、音乐、文学、书法、金石、建筑、装帧、工艺、戏剧、照相等，均有研究，可以说涉及到艺苑的各个领域，而且深究众妙，独创清新、自然、妥帖、和谐之情趣，自成一派。”这些评语，我是完全赞成的。
    本书可以说是反映丰子恺先生各方面成就的缩影。编者所费的心力是可以想象的。像这样精美的大型书画册，华夏出版社能不计人力物力精心出版，实在是于我国文化艺术极大的贡献。相信它的出版一定能博得海内外读者的欢喜赞叹！（附图片）
