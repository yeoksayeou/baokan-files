Individual households in Yongfeng Town come to pay taxes

On the morning of August 5th, more than 20 individual laborers from Yongfeng Town in our county came to the town tax office to pay their taxes.

These 22 individual business households are all major taxpayers in Yongfeng Town. In the first half of this year, they only paid 92,000 yuan in taxes. Tax officials analyzed that these individual business households had not paid enough taxes. To educate them on the importance of paying taxes according to the law, the tax office, in conjunction with the Yongfeng Town Party Committee, established a democratic appraisal group. They conducted a realistic appraisal of the business situations and tax payments of these individual business households, achieving good results. Li Shaoting of Qingfeng Trade Store concealed his accounts and only paid 2,936 yuan in taxes. This time, he voluntarily paid the actual amount of 21,983 yuan to the tax office. Li Minle of Xinxing Wholesale Department originally only paid 6,003 yuan in taxes. Through appraisal and study, he subsequently paid more than 20,000 yuan in taxes. Just on that morning, these 22 individual business households paid more than 200,000 yuan in taxes to the tax office.

    永丰镇个体户登门补交税款
    8月5日上午，我县永丰镇20多位个体劳动者携款相继来到镇税务所补交税款。
    这22位个体工商户，都是永丰镇的纳税大户，今年头6个月，他们只交了92000多元税款。税务干部分析，这些个体户都没交足税款，为教育他们依法纳税，便与永丰镇党委联合成立了民主评议小组，就这些个体户的经营情况与纳税额进行了实事求是的评议，取得了好的效果。庆丰贸易货栈的李绍庭隐瞒帐目，只交税款2936元。这次，他主动按实数到税务所补交税款21983元。新兴批发部的李民乐原只交税款6003元，通过评议与学习，他先后补交税款2万多元。光是这天上午，这22位个体户就登门补交税款20多万元。
