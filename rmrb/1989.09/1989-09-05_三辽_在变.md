The "Three Liaos" refer to the northern, western, and eastern regions of Liaoning Province, which are the deep hinterland of the Liaodong Peninsula. These areas are rich in resources but have seen relatively slow economic development. Over 98% of the province's poor counties, townships, and villages are concentrated here, constraining the overall economic development of the province. In October 1986, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government decided to mobilize the entire province to develop and build the "Three Liaos." In just over two years, more than 2,400 cadres and engineering and technical personnel from various provincial departments, organized into dozens of work teams, have worked tirelessly with the local cadres and masses of the "Three Liaos." They have helped the "Three Liaos" build 746 economic development projects, adding 530 million yuan in new output value. They have also facilitated horizontal cooperation between over a thousand urban industrial enterprises and the "Three Liaos" region, with 338 of these cooperative projects already in production, generating an annual output value of over 300 million yuan.

    “三辽”在变
    “三辽”系指辽宁的北部、西部和东部地区，是辽东半岛的深层腹地，资源丰富，但经济发展较慢，省内98％以上的贫困县、乡、村集中在这里，制约着全省经济的发展。1986年10月，辽宁省委、省政府决定动员全省力量开发建设“三辽”。短短两年多时间，省直各单位派出的2400多名干部和工程技术人员组成的几十个工作队，与“三辽”地区干部群众一起艰苦奋斗，现已帮助“三辽”地区建设经济开发项目746项，新增产值5.3亿元，促成上千家城市工业企业与“三辽”地区开展横向联合，目前已有338项联合项目投入生产，年产值达3亿多元。
