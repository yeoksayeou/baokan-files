I never thought I would become a writer. In April of this year, at the second session of the Shenyang Municipal Writers' Association, I was elected as the vice-chairman. Looking at the eyes full of trust and expectation, listening to the applause, I was deeply moved... I was originally just a worker who pushed a handcart and had only completed junior high school!

When the People's Republic of China was founded, I was just in primary school. "Come, come, come to school, even poor children can go to school now." This opening lesson is still fresh in my memory. My father was a carpenter who had never been to school in the old society. When I was doing my homework under the lamp, he often stroked my head with his rough hands and said, "Study hard, Dad will support you to go to middle school, to university!" But in 1957, just as I had been admitted to high school, my father passed away from an incurable disease. On his deathbed, he held my hand and said, "Child, I wanted to make a name for our hardworking people, to let you go to university, but now you have to go out and make a living."

At that time, I was only 17 years old. My mother was weak and often ill, and I had a younger sister and two younger brothers. If it were in the old China, our family of five would have had to beg on the streets; but in the new society, the streets and factories extended their warm hands, arranging jobs for me and my mother. For a long time, my family also received economic subsidies from the organization. Life was guaranteed, and my mother always had a smile on her face. My younger sister and brothers continued to study diligently, and they did not become illiterate like my father. We are all grateful to the Party!

I became a handcart worker, and the workload was very heavy every day. I once felt disheartened and thought that I would never have the chance to study culture again. One day after work, the party branch secretary of the cart team called me in and talked to me about Gorky and Qi Baishi, encouraging me to say, "You have some cultural knowledge, you should make use of this advantage. Through social practice and hard work, you can also improve your cultural level." He let me write blackboard newspapers, write speeches for workers, and compile programs for the art troupe in my spare time... I happily did all these things, and I became more and more interested and enthusiastic. I treated the library and the editorial department of the newspaper as my two "schools."

On October 28, 1965, after countless failed submissions, a novel I wrote was finally published in the supplement of the Shenyang Daily. At that time, I was so happy! After being promoted, I wrote news reports and various forms of literary works. The organization, in order to cultivate me, sent me to study at writing classes held by literary departments and publishing houses time and time again; in 1976, I was transferred to the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles to engage in professional literary creation. Over the past decade, I have insisted on deepening my understanding of life, creating and publishing more than 2 million words of literary works, including long and medium-length novels. The radio serial "I Am Not Lu Xunzi," based on my experience, won the "Dangui Cup Award" (first prize) in the first national radio serial competition. In October 1985, the Chinese Writers' Association accepted me as a formal member.

An ordinary handcart worker has become a professional writer. This is something my father would never have imagined in his lifetime! Sometimes when I walk on the street, my former colleagues who used to pull carts with me will suddenly stop their car beside me and stick their heads out of the window to greet me, "Hey! What great work is our writer writing now?" This is their concern for me, and also their encouragement. I will never forget them, and I will not let down the Party's cultivation and expectations.

    我没想到成了作家
    沈阳市文联　崔亚斌
    今年4月，在沈阳市作家协会第二届会员代表大会上，我被选为市作协副主席。望着那一双双充满信任和期望的眼睛，听着那阵阵的掌声，我十分激动……我本来是个仅有初中文化的手推车工人哪！
    人民共和国诞生时，我刚念小学。“来来来，来上学，穷人家的孩子也能上学了。”这开蒙的第一篇课文，我至今记得清清楚楚。我父亲是个木匠，旧社会没念过一天书。当我在灯下做作业时，他常用粗糙的大手抚摸着我的头说：“好好念吧，爸爸供你念中学，念大学！”可是，1957年我刚刚考入高中，父亲就因患不治之症离去了。临终，他拉着我的手说：“孩子，我本想给咱们干力气活儿的人争口气，让你上大学，可是现在你得去挣钱养家呀！”
    当时，我年仅17岁。母亲体弱多病，我还有妹妹、弟弟3人。如果在旧中国，我们一家5口只能沿街乞讨；可是新社会，街道和工厂伸出温暖的手，为我和母亲安排了工作。在较长一段时间里，我家还享受着组织上的经济补助。生活有了保障，母亲脸上常带着笑容，妹妹、弟弟们继续安心学习，他们都没有成为父亲那样的文盲。我们一家人衷心感谢党！
    我当了手推车工人，每天劳动强度很大。我曾一度心灰意冷，感到自己再难沾文化学习的边了。一天收车后，车队党支部书记把我找去，给我讲高尔基、齐白石，鼓励说：“你有一定的文化知识，要发挥这个长处。在社会实践中努力学习，同样能提高文化水平。”他让我在工余时间写黑板报，给工人写发言稿，为文艺队编节目……我都高兴地去做了，而且越做越有兴趣，越做越有劲头。我把图书馆和报刊编辑部当成我的两所“学校”。
    1965年10月28日，在经过不知多少次投稿失败之后，我写的一篇小说终于在《沈阳日报》的副刊版上发表了。当时我是多么高兴啊！提干以后，我写新闻稿，写各种形式的文学作品。组织上为了培养我，一次又一次地送我到文艺部门和出版社举办的学习班学习创作；1976年，又将我调到市文联从事专业文学创作。10多年来，我坚持深入生活，创作发表了长篇、中篇小说等200多万字的文学作品。以我的经历为基础创作的广播连续剧《我不是骆驼祥子》，在全国首届广播连续剧比赛中获“丹桂杯奖”（一等奖）。1985年10月，中国作家协会接纳我为正式会员。
    一个普普通通的手推车工人，居然成了一名专业作家。这是父亲生前怎么也不会想到的吧！有时我走在街上，往日曾在一起拉车的伙伴会把行驶中的汽车在我身边戛然停住，从车窗探出头打招呼：“喂！咱们的作家又写什么大作哪？”这是对我的关心，也是对我的鞭策。我决不忘记他们，更不会辜负党的培养和期望。
