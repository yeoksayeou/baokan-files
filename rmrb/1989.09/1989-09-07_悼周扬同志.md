The autumn wind is chilly, and we mourn your passing.
The literary world weeps as the crane departs.
Comrades remember you with deep affection,
The arts community silently honors your spirit.

Half a lifetime of diligent work will never be forgotten,
A life dedicated to China will forever be remembered.
Do you still recall the campus of Renmin University?
New sprouts flourish, and flowers bloom brightly.

    悼周扬同志
    强晓初
    秋风萧瑟悲君逝，
    鹤驾文坛恸失声。
    侪辈依依怀战友，
    艺林默默悼英灵。
    孜孜半纪岂能忘，
    荦荦一生华夏铭。
    延大校园曾记否？
    新苗茁壮百花明。
