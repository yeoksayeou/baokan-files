The Asian Basketball Federation has decided that from now on, teams participating in the Asian Championships and the Asian Games can have one foreign professional player who has obtained citizenship in the country. This decision was made in accordance with the resolution passed by the International Amateur Basketball Federation in Munich in April this year, which opened the door to professional players. The Asian Basketball Federation stipulates that from December 31, 1989, national teams in Asia can have one foreign professional player who has obtained citizenship for more than three years, and club teams can have two such players. There is no limit on the number of domestic professional players participating in various levels of competitions in Asia. This will undoubtedly help improve the level of basketball in Asia.

This meeting also decided that if the number of teams participating in the Asian Women's Basketball Championship exceeds 10, they will be divided into two levels: A and B. The top five teams from the previous championship will be in the A level, and after the competition, the last team in the A level will be demoted, while the first team in the B level will be promoted. This move aims to avoid one-sided matches between strong and weak teams and encourages balanced development. If the number of participating teams is less than 10, the single round-robin system will still be used.

Other decisions made at this Asian Basketball Federation meeting include: the 13th Asian Women's Basketball Championship will be held in Singapore in March 1990; according to Japan's request, the 16th Asian Men's Basketball Championship, originally scheduled to be held in Indonesia, will be moved to Kobe, Japan, in September 1991. Indonesia will host the 4th Asian Club Men's Basketball Championship in 1990. The meeting also decided to impose a fine of $1,000 to $10,000 on any team that has registered for an international competition but withdraws before the competition. Oman was admitted as the 30th member of the Asian Basketball Federation at this meeting.

    亚篮联对职业选手参赛资格作出规定
    日本承办下届亚洲男篮赛
    本报讯　据新华社报道：日前在北京举行的亚洲篮球联合会代表大会决定，今后参加亚洲锦标赛和亚运会的各队只允许有拥有一名外国已取得本国国籍的职业选手。
    该决定是根据世界业余篮球联合会今年4月在慕尼黑通过的向职业选手敞开大门的决议做出的。亚篮联规定从1989年12月31日起亚洲的国家队允许拥有一名、俱乐部队允许拥有两名已取得该国国籍3年以上的外国职业选手，而对本国的职业球员参加亚洲的各级比赛则没有人数限制。这无疑将有益于提高亚洲的篮球运动水平。
    本次代表大会还决定，今后参加亚洲女篮锦标赛的队如超过10支，则分为甲、乙两个级别，甲级队为上届锦标赛的前5名，经过比赛甲级队的最后一名降级，乙级队的第一名晋级。此举是为避免出现强弱队之间令人乏味的一边倒比赛，鼓励各队平衡发展。如参赛队不足10支，则仍按单循环赛规则比赛。
    这次亚篮联代表大会的其他决定是，第十三届亚洲女篮锦标赛将于1990年3月在新加坡举行；根据日本要求，第十六届亚洲男篮锦标赛由原定在印度尼西亚改在日本的神户举行，时间是1991年9月。印度尼西亚将于1990年承办第四届亚洲俱乐部男篮赛。大会还决定对今后已报名参加洲际比赛，又在赛前突然撤出的各队，罚款1000至1万美金。阿曼在这次大会上被接纳为亚篮联的第30个会员国。
