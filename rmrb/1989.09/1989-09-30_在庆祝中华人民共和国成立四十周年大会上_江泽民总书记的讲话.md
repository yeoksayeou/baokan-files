**Speech by Jiang Zemin at the Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China**

Comrades and Friends,

Today, we gather here to solemnly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I extend my respect to all the workers, peasants, intellectuals, representatives of all democratic parties and patriotic individuals from all walks of life who have contributed to the socialist construction in various fields! I extend my respect to the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the People's Police who have established historical merits in defending the People's Republic and the socialist cause! I extend my warm greetings to the compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese who are dedicated to the unification of the motherland and the rejuvenation of China! I express my heartfelt thanks to all foreign friends and peoples of the world who have been friendly to us and supported the modernization of China!

Here, we also pay our highest respect to the late revolutionary forerunners of the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De, who made great contributions to the founding and construction of the socialist People's Republic. We deeply mourn the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the establishment and defense of New China!

We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of our nation shortly after achieving a decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and successfully convening the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The turmoil and rebellion that occurred this spring and summer were a product of both international and domestic factors. The domestic and foreign hostile forces created this turmoil with the aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China, subverting the socialist system, turning China into a bourgeois republic, and making it a vassal of Western capitalist powers again. The nature of this struggle is the sharp confrontation between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization, a political struggle concerning the life and death of our Party, country, and nation, and a serious class struggle. We have won this struggle, safeguarding the achievements of countless martyrs and patriots who fought for the survival and liberation of the Chinese nation over the past century, safeguarding the achievements of the new democratic revolution and socialist revolution over the past half century, and safeguarding the achievements of socialist construction and reform and opening up over the past forty years. The old generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their representative, supported the correct decisions of the majority of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, turned the tide, and played a pivotal role in the struggle. The victory of this struggle will have a profound impact on the development direction, prospects, and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation's socialist cause, as well as on the development of the international socialist cause. Practice has already proven and will continue to prove that the policies and measures taken by the Party and the government to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion have prevented the country and the people from falling into a serious internal turmoil and historical regression, and are in line with the common will and fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Comrade Zhao Ziyang committed serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party. It was precisely because our Party resolutely corrected his mistakes that we won this struggle. Now, the significance of this struggle's victory is being increasingly recognized by more people. We must carry this struggle through to the end, educate and unite the vast majority, isolate and strike a small number of hostile elements, thoroughly investigate all counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities, leave no hidden dangers, and draw profound lessons from them. We can confidently declare that any attempt by foreign hostile forces to turn China into a vassal state, and any plot by domestic hostile forces to reverse the verdict on the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, will be doomed to failure.

The victory of this struggle further proves that the socialist road chosen by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist reform cause being carried out are irreversible historical trends on the vast land of China. The progress and development of socialist China are unstoppable by any difficulties and cannot be shaken or changed by any domestic or foreign hostile forces.

The 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been 40 years of tremendous changes in Chinese history, 40 years of overcoming numerous difficulties and advancing steadily, and 40 years of the Chinese nation standing tall, achieving independence and autonomy, and playing an increasingly important role in international affairs.

The founding of the People's Republic of China ended the rule of the exploiting classes that had lasted for thousands of years on the Chinese mainland and ended the long history of being bullied by imperialism. The Chinese people have since become the masters of their own country and society. The victory of the Chinese revolution was the most significant event in the history of the international communist movement after the October Revolution in Russia and the most significant event in world politics after World War II. This victory changed the world political landscape, inspired the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, and made a significant contribution to the progress of humanity.

We have applied the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, combined with China's actual situation, and established a socialist state power led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants in the most populous Eastern country in the world. We have implemented the system of people's congresses, ensuring the broad masses' power and democratic rights to manage state and social affairs. We have implemented the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to the principles of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, mutual trust, and sharing weal and woe," widely absorbing the participation of all democratic parties and patriotic individuals from all walks of life, and forming the broadest patriotic united front. Although our political system still needs to be gradually improved, it will definitely provide sufficient possibilities and broad prospects for the democratization of national politics, economy, culture, and social life through self-reform and development.

After the founding of New China, we only took three years to heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy to the highest level in the history of the old China. On this basis, we completed the socialist transformation of the means of production, eliminated the system of exploitation and the exploiting classes, and established a socialist economic system with public ownership of the means of production and distribution according to work as its main body and basic characteristics. Although our economic system still needs to be gradually improved, it will definitely provide sufficient possibilities and broad prospects for further improving the productivity and labor productivity of society, and improving the material and cultural living standards of all the people through self-reform and development.

We have used the basic political and economic systems of socialism, relied on the people of all ethnic groups to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, overcome various difficulties, and transformed China from a poor and backward semi-colonial, semi-feudal country into a prosperous socialist country. In 1988, China's gross national product reached 1401.5 billion yuan, and the national income was 1177 billion yuan. After deducting the price factor, they were 19.8 times and 18 times those of 1949, respectively. China's gross national product has risen to the 8th place in the world, and some important products have leaped to the forefront of the world. From 1950 to 1988, the cumulative total investment in fixed assets of state-owned units was 2153.8 billion yuan, with 4393 large and medium-sized projects completed and put into operation, adding 1561.9 billion yuan in fixed assets. Now, China has established an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system. With the development of production, the actual consumption level of the national population increased from 76 yuan per person per year in 1952 to 639 yuan in 1988, an average annual increase of 3.7% after deducting the price increase factor. The basic problem of food and clothing for the entire population has been solved, and a part of the residents' living standards have begun to move towards a moderately prosperous level. China's education, science, culture, health, and sports have also made great progress. In 40 years, ordinary colleges and universities have trained 619.2 million undergraduate and junior college graduates and 154,000 graduate students, which is 30 times the total number of graduates in the 37 years before the founding of New China. In the past 40 years, major scientific and technological research achievements have emerged in an endless stream. In fields such as atomic energy technology, biology, agriculture, high-energy physics, computer technology, launch vehicle technology, and satellite communication technology, some have reached or approached the world's advanced level. National defense construction has achieved great results, enhancing the strength to defend the motherland. These achievements have laid a solid foundation for China's socialist modernization construction.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have adhered to taking economic construction as the center, adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhered to reform and opening up. The national economic strength has rapidly increased, and the people have obtained more actual benefits. From 1979 to 1988, China's gross national product increased by an average of 9.6% per year at comparable prices, exceeding the average annual growth rate of 6.1% from 1953 to 1978, and far exceeding the average annual growth rate of 2% to 4% in most countries in the world. In 1988, compared with 1978, the total volume of imports and exports increased fourfold. In these ten years, after deducting the price increase factor, the average annual income of farmers increased by 11.8%, and the average annual income of urban residents increased by 6.5%. In ten years, 80 billion square meters of new housing have been built in urban and rural areas. On the basis of improving food, clothing, daily necessities, and housing, the savings deposits of urban and rural residents increased from 21.1 billion yuan at the end of 1978 to 380.2 billion yuan at the end of 1988. The tremendous achievements of these ten years are the results of implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and are also the further development of the achievements of socialist revolution and construction in the previous 30 years.

Our economic development and the improvement of people's living standards are not only very significant compared to China's past history but also not inferior to many other countries. Although China's economy is still relatively backward, it has achieved what would have been impossible under the previous system of exploitation, demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system. The people of all ethnic groups in the country have every reason to be genuinely pleased and proud of the abundant fruits created by their hard work!

We must fully affirm the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people under the socialist system. Any view that doubts or denies our achievements is groundless, erroneous, and harmful. At the same time, we must fully recognize and resolutely correct the mistakes in our work. The view that does not acknowledge mistakes is also groundless, erroneous, and harmful. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has restored and developed the thought line of seeking truth from facts, adhered to the principle that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, corrected "left" and "right" errors, opposed bourgeois liberalization, and re-established and implemented the correct line of Marxism. Our Party has made scientific conclusions on some historical issues in the first 30 years. We must adhere to these correct conclusions and continue to summarize the experiences and lessons of the past 10 years of modernization construction and reform and opening up to gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of historical experience.

Reviewing the history of 40 years, we can at least draw the following four basic conclusions:

The establishment, consolidation, and development of the socialist system reflect the objective laws of modern Chinese social movements and are the greatest and most profound changes in Chinese history. If we had not carried out a people's revolution with socialism as its goal, we would not have been able to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and we would not have been able to turn dark China into a bright China. If New China had not taken the socialist road and adhered to the people's democratic dictatorship after its establishment, we would not have been able to maintain national unity and national independence, and we would not have been able to gradually realize the common aspiration of the people to become prosperous together. If we do not adhere to socialism in the future but, as some people advocate, retreat to the capitalist road and use the blood and sweat of the working people to cultivate and fatten a bourgeoisie again, in a country with a large population and a low level of social productivity, it will only cause the majority of people to fall back into extreme poverty. Such capitalism can only be primitive and comprador capitalism, which can only mean that the people of all ethnic groups in China will once again become the dual slaves of foreign capital and the domestic exploiting classes. In short, as Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have pointed out, only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China.

The socialist system is a system that develops and improves itself on its own basis. Under socialist conditions, our fundamental task is to take economic construction as the center and vigorously develop the productive forces. Based on the national conditions, summarize practical experience, and according to the actual level and objective requirements of the development of social productive forces, consciously adjust the parts of the production relations that are not in line with the productive forces, and adjust the parts of the superstructure that are not in line with the economic base. This is what we call socialist reform. If we do not carry out such a reform, it will stifle the vitality and vitality of socialism, and seriously hinder the play of the superiority of socialism. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has incorporated reform and opening up into the Party's basic line, opening up a new situation in the development of China's socialist cause. The tremendous achievements of the past ten years prove that the general policy and general policy of reform and opening up are completely correct and must be firmly carried out.

To carry forward the spirit of patriotism, adhere to the principles of independence and self-reliance, is a fundamental experience of both the Chinese revolution and the construction of Chinese socialism. In contemporary China, patriotism and socialism are essentially united. History has proven that patriots who firmly defend the dignity of the Chinese nation and hope for the prosperity and strength of China are mostly loyal socialists or reliable friends of socialism. The patriotism and self-reliance spirit of the Chinese people are a powerful force for socialist modernization construction. Our socialist cause has been consolidated and developed in the process of breaking through the isolation, blockade, and provocation of foreign hostile forces against our country. The Chinese people have never, and will never, yield to any external pressure, and will never abandon the socialist road and national independence in exchange for the charity of others. We have always welcomed and sought the support of the peoples of all countries for our cause. In the new situation, we pay more attention to making use of favorable international conditions, adhering to opening up to the outside world, and accelerating the modernization construction of Chinese socialism.

The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the faithful representative of the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China, playing an extremely important role in the independence and development of the country. The Communist Party of China has become the core of the Chinese revolution and construction, which is the correct choice made by the people in long-term practice. The Party has matured in the process of overcoming difficulties, correcting mistakes, and summarizing historical experience. The achievements of the past 40 years have been achieved under the correct leadership of our Party, relying on the efforts of the people of the whole country. The occurrence of errors and setbacks is often mainly due to problems within the Party. The situation of the Party has a decisive significance for the fate of the country and the nation. We must seriously and mercilessly analyze and resolutely correct the mistakes in our work and solve the problems existing within the Party. We must scientifically and historically summarize experience, objectively and comprehensively understand the reality. As long as we do this, our Party will definitely not disappoint the people's expectations and will write a brilliant chapter in the realization of new historical tasks.

Based on the above basic conclusions, we must more firmly combine the universal truth of Marxism with China's specific reality, walk our own path, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific theory that has been recognized and accepted by hundreds of millions of people after ten years of practice, and is the banner guiding us to continue to advance. In the entire primary stage of socialism, we must firmly implement the basic line formulated by the Thirteenth National Congress: to lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, be self-reliant, and strive hard to build China into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country. At present, we must work together to consolidate and develop the victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity, and strive to achieve the stable development of the national economy.

Here, I would like to emphasize several important issues that need special attention in the current work of the Party and the state.

1. **On the Unity of Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and Adhering to Reform and Opening Up**: The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the country, and reform and opening up are the path to prosperity. This has become the common understanding of all comrades in the Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Many facts tell us that on the issue of reform and opening up, there are actually two completely different proposals. One is the reform and opening up advocated by the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, which is to adhere to the socialist road, adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The other is the reform and opening up advocated by those who adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position and demand the "complete Westernization" of China, which is to separate, oppose, and be contrary to the Four Cardinal Principles. The so-called "reform and opening up" is essentially capitalist, aiming to bring China into the Western capitalist system. We must clearly distinguish between the two. At present, the sharp confrontation between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization can be said to be mainly reflected in the question of whether reform and opening up should adhere to the socialist direction. When we formulate and implement various policies, measures, and plans for modernizing construction, we must adhere to the organic unity of the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, and concretely implement the Four Cardinal Principles in various works. We must correctly and better implement reform and opening up, making the socialist economic and political systems of China more perfect, so as to promote the better and faster development of the national economy and other social undertakings. The various policies and measures for reform and opening up announced by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, including the basic policies and measures for economic special zones and coastal open areas, should continue to be implemented and gradually improved in practice. The reforms that have been determined to be piloted and the areas that are carrying out comprehensive reform trials should continue to be piloted and experimented, and the experience should be seriously summarized. We should further carry forward the spirit of daring to explore and innovate, and continue to push forward the cause of reform and opening up.

2. **On the Strategic Deployment of China's Economic Development and the Rectification and Ordering**: According to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal, our Party has formulated the strategic goal of socialist modernization construction in three steps. The first step is to double the gross national product of 1980, solve the problem of the people's basic subsistence; the second step is to double the gross national product again by the end of this century, and make the people's living standard reach a moderately prosperous level; the third step is to basically realize modernization by the middle of the next century, with the per capita gross national product reaching the level of a moderately developed country, and the people living a relatively prosperous life. Then, on this basis, continue to advance. This strategic goal is neither rushing for success nor doing nothing, but is in line with China's reality and can be achieved through efforts. In the process of achieving this strategic goal, we must adhere to the priority development of education, gradually shift economic development to the track of relying on technological progress and continuously improving labor productivity, strictly control population growth, improve population quality, rationally utilize resources, and pay attention to protecting the ecological environment. These are all very important. Now, the first step has been basically achieved, and we are in the process of achieving the second step, which is the most critical step. To complete this task, we must firmly continue to implement the policy of rectification and ordering, deepening reform, and strive to use three years or more to fundamentally ease the contradiction between the total demand and total supply of society, gradually eliminate inflation, and make the national economy get out of the predicament. The economic difficulties we are currently facing have accumulated over the past few years. We must have a sufficient estimate of the difficulties, which is much more active than underestimating them, and at the same time, we must also see the favorable conditions for overcoming the difficulties. On the basis of the construction of the past 30 years, after ten years of reform and opening up and development, China's economic strength has greatly increased. After a year of practice of rectification and ordering, our understanding has become more consistent. Our development prospects are bright. All comrades in the Party must fully carry forward the spirit of hard work and thrift, set an example, and work with the people of the whole country to tighten our belts for a few years. During the period of rectification and ordering, we must emphasize concentration more, gradually improve the proportion of state financial revenue in national income, and the proportion of central financial revenue in state financial revenue. Without the necessary financial power, the central government cannot guarantee the implementation of key construction and rectification and ordering tasks. It is necessary to strengthen the authority of the central government, oppose decentralization, and be conducive to leading the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. Rectification and ordering are not retrogression, nor is it not to reform. Rectification and ordering not only create conditions for deepening reform and ensuring the healthy development of reform but also need the support of reform itself. Any view or behavior that separates and opposes rectification and ordering with reform is incorrect. Being not active in rectification and ordering is also being not active in reform.

3. **On the Unity of Adhering to the Planned Economy and Market Regulation**: Our socialist economy is a commodity economy based on public ownership and planned guidance. This commodity economy is essentially different from the capitalist commodity economy based on private ownership and basically regulated by the market. In general, consciously implementing the planned and proportional development of the national economy is a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system and a basic characteristic of the socialist economy. The past overly centralized and rigid planned system must undoubtedly be reformed. In the past ten years, while implementing planned guidance, we have given full play to the positive role of market regulation, achieving remarkable results in promoting the development of the national economy, activating the market, and improving the living standards of the people. Of course, if we blindly weaken or even completely negate the planned economy and attempt to fully implement the market economy, it will not work in China and will inevitably lead to chaos in economic life and the entire social life. In the current process of rectifying and ordering the national economy, we must emphasize the guiding role of the plan more, and at the same time, further rectify and improve the market order. We must explore in practice and strive to create a socialist commodity economy operating mechanism that suits China's situation and organically combines the planned economy with market regulation. The degree, methods, and scope of the combination of the planned economy and market regulation should be adjusted and improved according to the actual situation from time to time. This is a major theoretical and practical issue. I hope that all comrades in the Party, especially economic workers, will make arduous efforts for this and strive to gradually solve this problem.

4. **On Adhering to the Public Ownership as the Main Body and Developing Various Economic Components**: In China's economic development, we must continue to adhere to the policy of public ownership as the main body and develop various economic components, giving full play to the beneficial and necessary supplementary role of individual economy, private economy, and Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises in the socialist economy. Adhering to this policy is to better give play to the superiority of the socialist economy and promote the faster development of China's economy, and is not to weaken or abolish the dominant position of the public ownership economy, let alone to implement "privatization." The proportion and development scope of the non-public ownership economy in China's national economy should be determined according to China's actual level of productive forces and objective needs, and cannot be simply taken as a measure of the achievements of reform. The state should support the development of the public ownership economy in terms of funds, credit, energy, and raw material supply, and at the same time, deepen the reform of the management system of public ownership enterprises. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of China's socialist modernization construction and the main source of state financial revenue. They must fully play their leading role. It is of special importance to the development of China's economy. We must not only provide the necessary conditions for them from a macro perspective but also encourage them to strengthen the basic work within the enterprise, improve management, carry out technological transformation and innovation, fully tap the potential within the enterprise, so as to enhance their ability of self-balancing, self-accumulation, self-development, and self-discipline, and better give play to the advantages and leading role of the public ownership economy. The state's support for the development of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should also be carried out according to the industrial policy and actual possibilities, distinguishing between heavy and light, urgent and non-urgent, and in a planned and step-by-step manner, and cannot be evenly distributed. In the current stage of China, the development of individual economy, private economy, and other economies subordinate to the socialist economy, which are important and indispensable for the development of social production, convenience of people's life, and expansion of employment, has been fully proven by the practice of reform in the past ten years. Our policy is, first, to encourage them to develop actively within the scope allowed by the state; second, to use economic, administrative, and legal means to strengthen management and guidance, so as to give play to their positive role and limit their negative role that is not conducive to the development of the socialist economy.

5. **On Adhering to the Distribution System with Distribution According to Work as the Main Body and Preventing and Correcting Social Distribution Inequality**: The development of various economic components with public ownership as the main body necessarily requires the implementation of a distribution system with distribution according to work as the main body and various distribution forms. We have made progress in establishing and improving this distribution system through reform. We advocate the goal of common prosperity, allowing a part of the people to get rich first through honest labor and legal business operations. This policy is correct and should be continued. At the same time, we must also see that there are many problems in the current distribution field, and some are quite serious. On the one hand, the phenomenon of egalitarianism in enterprises, institutions, and party and government organs among workers and staff who rely on wages for their income has not been completely overcome, and in some places, departments, and fields, it has even grown; on the other hand, the phenomenon of excessive income disparity has also emerged. This is mainly reflected in the excessive income gap between the broad masses of workers, cadres, and intellectuals who rely on wages for their income and many non-production sectors, between some people engaged in "second jobs," and especially between private enterprise owners and some individual laborers. This has attracted the attention of the whole society and the strong dissatisfaction of the laboring masses. Social distribution inequality is not only an economic problem but also a social and political problem. It dampens the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, cadres, and intellectuals, promotes the expansion of consumption funds, and especially the phenomenon of making huge profits through speculation, bribery, embezzlement, and theft, which has produced serious consequences of disrupting the economic order, corrupting social customs, and affecting social stability. Therefore, we must attach great importance to and seriously solve this problem. Legal income should be protected, excessive income should be adjusted through taxation, and illegal income should be resolutely eliminated. At the same time, we should gradually improve the living treatment of brain and physical laborers with relatively low income. Currently, a considerable part of the fixed asset investment and working capital input has been improperly transformed into consumption funds, seriously affecting the development and momentum of the economy, which must be resolutely corrected. Meanwhile, we must also adhere to the principle of combining material incentives with spiritual incentives, correct the wrong tendency of "everything for money," and fully mobilize and protect the enthusiasm of the broad masses of laborers.

6. **On Strengthening Basic Industries and Adjusting the Economic Structure**: To ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, we must, from the perspective of the long-term strategic development of China's modernization construction, and based on the actual situation of the current serious imbalance in the industrial structure, strengthen the basic industries, adjust the industrial structure, strive to enhance the momentum of China's economic and social development, and overcome the short-sighted behavior of pursuing surface prosperity. We must vigorously strengthen agriculture, energy, transportation, communications, important raw materials, and other basic industries and infrastructure, ensure the development of science and technology and education, and strictly control the scale and speed of processing industries and non-production construction. To this end, we must continue to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment, strictly control the growth rate of consumption funds, vigorously carry out the movement of increasing production and saving, and gradually achieve the balance of finance, credit, foreign exchange, and major materials. We must concentrate financial and material resources on the construction of agriculture and other basic industries, improve the overall productivity of society. This is the overall situation of the country and the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups, which is related to the future of the entire socialist modernization construction. Therefore, we must advocate that immediate interests serve long-term interests, local interests serve overall interests, and personal and collective interests serve national interests.

The stable growth of agriculture, especially grain production, is the foundation for the development of the entire national economy. The food problem for 1.1 billion people can only be solved by ourselves through correct policies and sustained efforts, and cannot be solved by relying on others. At any time, we must not forget this most basic national condition. To develop agriculture, first, we must continue to deepen rural reforms, implement stable rural policies, improve various forms of the responsibility system for production, and establish and improve the pre-production, in-production, and post-production service system. At the same time, in areas with conditions, we must, based on the principle of farmers' voluntary participation, steadily promote appropriate-scale management. Second, we must actively promote the application of advanced agricultural scientific and technological achievements, organize agricultural regional development in a planned way, develop new productive forces, and make agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery develop comprehensively. Third, we must increase the investment of the state, local governments, collectives, and farmers in agriculture, expand agricultural water conservancy construction, vigorously develop agricultural machinery, improve agricultural production conditions, and resolutely correct the phenomenon of blindly occupying and wasting arable land. On the premise of vigorously strengthening agriculture, we must continue to encourage and guide the healthy development of township enterprises. Township enterprises should be rectified in a planned way, reasonably control the development speed, seriously adjust the industrial structure, and improve management and management style.

7. **On the Construction of Socialist Democracy and Legal System**: Building a high level of socialist democracy and a complete socialist legal system is an important goal and task of China's socialist modernization construction and the common aspiration of the Party and the people. Since the founding of the nation, especially in the past ten years, China's democratic and legal construction has achieved remarkable achievements, and in the main aspects of national and social life, there are basically laws to follow. At the same time, we must see that China's democratic and legal construction is still a very arduous task. Without democracy, there is no socialism. Socialist legal system is the embodiment and guarantee of socialist democracy. Destroying the socialist legal system will inevitably harm socialist democracy. We must strictly abide by the Constitution and laws. We must continue to improve China's people's congress system and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, establish and improve the procedures and systems of democratic decision-making and democratic supervision, expand the channels of contact and dialogue with the masses, improve citizens' awareness of participation in politics, and ensure that the will and interests of the broad masses are truly reflected in national and social life. This is as important as economic development for the long-term stability and prosperity of our country. Our democratic and legal construction must proceed from China's reality, gradually and in an orderly manner along the socialist direction and track. In this process, we can learn from some practices of capitalist countries, but we must not copy them. We must distinguish between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy, and between socialist democracy and extreme democratization and anarchism. A few people advocate so-called "elite" politics, advocate political pluralism and multi-party system, which is essentially to exclude the broad masses from democracy, deny the leading position of the Communist Party, and replace the socialist People's Republic with a bourgeois republic. The extreme democratization and anarchist trends have a relatively broad social basis in China and have great destructive power to our cause, and are easily used by a few reactionary elements. We must be highly vigilant and resolutely resist the spread of this trend. Doing so is precisely to safeguard the democratic rights of the vast majority, and to ensure the healthy development of socialist democracy and legal construction. The democracy of the people and the dictatorship over hostile elements and anti-social elements are closely combined and unified. As long as class struggle still exists to a certain extent, the function of dictatorship cannot be weakened.

8. **On the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization**: Socialism not only aims to achieve economic prosperity but also to achieve the overall progress of society. The basic policy of grasping both socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization is correct. Spiritual civilization construction, after all, is to improve the overall quality of the nation, cultivate socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. It is unimaginable that a nation without a strong spiritual pillar can stand tall among the nations of the world. We must deeply draw lessons from the past few years when material civilization construction was strong and spiritual civilization construction was weak, and while striving to develop material civilization, we must also earnestly grasp the construction of spiritual civilization. The development of education and science is a long-term plan with great and far-reaching significance for the improvement of productivity and national quality. Our education and science are still relatively backward, so we must take effective measures to consciously grasp this work. We must closely combine the actual situation of modernization construction and reform and opening up, and the actual situation of people's thoughts, vigorously strengthen and improve the work in the field of ideology, strengthen and improve ideological and political work, persistently carry out ideological education on patriotism, collectivism, socialism, self-reliance, and hard work among the people of the whole country, especially the youth, and carry out revolutionary tradition education for Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and advanced elements. We must also carry out communist ideological education for them from time to time. We must use Marxism and socialist ideology to guide the work of theory, propaganda, education, news, publishing, literature, and art, to occupy the ideological and cultural front and the public opinion front, to enrich the spiritual life of the people. We must actively guide the broad masses to consciously resist the influence of various erroneous trends of thought and decadent ideas, cultivate scientific, healthy, and civilized ways of life, and make them truly become progressive socialist laborers and builders. All levels and types of schools should not only establish a complete system of cultural knowledge transmission but also put ethics in the first place and establish the correct political direction. We will continue to adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, to flourish and develop scientific and cultural undertakings. We will actively absorb all the excellent achievements of Chinese history and culture and foreign culture, and resolutely reject all the dregs and garbage of feudalism and capitalism. On this issue, we must pay special attention to opposing the trend of completely negating Chinese traditional culture and the trend of worshipping foreigners.

9. **On Strengthening the Leadership of the Working Class, Consolidating the Alliance Between Workers and Peasants, and Enhancing the Great Unity of the People of All Ethnic Groups in the Country**: Workers, peasants, and intellectuals are the basic forces of socialist modernization construction. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class is determined by the nature of our Party and state. The working class, especially industrial workers, is closely linked with modern large-scale production, is the representative of advanced productive forces and production relations, and has high organizational discipline. In the long-term revolutionary struggle and construction practice, they have shown a firm political stance and the spirit of self-sacrifice, hard work, and historical initiative, and are indeed the leading class of our country and the backbone of the socialist cause. Any view that belittles the status and role of the working class is completely wrong. A few people attempt to create a so-called "middle class" in China as their support force to subvert our socialist system, which further proves that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. The broad masses of peasants in China have always been the natural allies of the working class and the steadfast supporters of the socialist system and the leadership of the Party. We must further strengthen the support of industry for agriculture and the support of cities for the countryside, and from the political, economic, educational, scientific, and cultural aspects, continuously take practical measures to consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants on a new basis. This is the fundamental condition for the stability of the country and society. The intellectuals in China have already become a part of the working class. Without knowledge and intellectuals, it is impossible to build socialism. Our Party's basic viewpoint and the policy towards intellectuals since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have not changed and will not change due to the recent political turmoil. We have already had a good team of intellectuals who insist on walking the socialist road. All levels of Party committees and governments must continue to implement the policy of "respecting knowledge and respecting talents," and strive to create and provide good working and living conditions for intellectuals. The Party and the government have always regarded the broad masses of young people, including young intellectuals, as the future and hope of the motherland, and have always adopted an attitude of warm care and strict requirements towards them, sincerely hoping that they will grow up healthily and become talents quickly. We also sincerely hope that the broad masses of intellectuals, especially young intellectuals, will seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, insist on combining with social practice and combining with workers and peasants, continuously draw nourishment from the historical creative activities of the people, and fully display their wisdom and talents in the socialist construction of the motherland.

We must, on the basis of consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, further develop the broadest united front of all socialist laborers, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who support the unification of the motherland, and enhance the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. China is a unified multi-ethnic country. All the achievements of our revolution, construction, and reform are the common creations of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups have not only established and developed a new type of equal, united, and mutually supportive relationship but also, through the implementation of regional ethnic autonomy, ensured the right of ethnic minorities to manage their internal affairs as masters. The political, economic, educational, and cultural undertakings in ethnic minority areas have also made great progress. We must firmly and unswervingly implement the policy of ethnic equality, ethnic unity, and common prosperity of all ethnic groups. We must fully trust and rely on ethnic minority cadres and masses, and clearly oppose all conspiracies to split the motherland. We must strengthen the legal construction of regional ethnic autonomy, vigorously cultivate ethnic minority cadres and various professionals, and ensure that ethnic autonomous areas fully exercise their autonomy rights. We must take necessary measures to continue to help and support the development of the economy, education, culture, and other undertakings in ethnic minority areas, and make long-term and unremitting efforts to gradually eliminate the gaps that exist to varying degrees between ethnic groups due to historical reasons.

10. **On Strengthening the Construction of the Party**: Our Party is a great Marxist party, the decisive force for maintaining the long-term stability of China's political situation, and the strong core leading the people of all ethnic groups in China to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the rebellion has once again tested our Party, proving that the Party is generally good and strong. Our Party was born, developed, and grew strong in close contact with the masses. Without the support of the masses, the Party cannot survive for a day. After our Party became the ruling party, some bureaucratism, commandism, seeking personal gain, and corruption gradually emerged within the Party. In recent years, due to the weakening of Party construction and ideological and political work, the seriousness of problems in ideology, style, discipline, and organization within the Party has been further aggravated. We must insist on the purpose of "wholeheartedly serving the people," insist on the fine tradition of combining theory with practice, maintaining close contact with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing, strictly govern the Party according to the Party Constitution, take decisive and effective measures, resolutely overcome various corrupt phenomena, and restore and develop the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people. All Party organizations, especially the Central Committee, must strictly implement the system of democratic centralism. All levels of leadership organs must insist on the combination of collective leadership and personal division of labor and responsibility, improve Party life, strengthen democratic supervision, and prevent a few people from deciding everything, and even more, do not allow personal dictatorship. We must pay high attention to the construction of grassroots Party organizations and change the situation of weakness and dispersion. All Communist Party members, especially leading cadres, must strictly abide by the Party's discipline, consciously maintain consistency with the Party's line, principles, and decisions in words and deeds, and never allow everyone to do as they please.

The improvement of the Party in theory is the fundamental guarantee of the correctness and scientific nature of the Party's leadership. In view of the many new situations and problems in the world and China, in view of the heavy responsibilities of our Party in the socialist construction of China and the important position of our Party in the international communist movement, it is necessary to take the study and research of Marxist basic theory, and the study and exploration of major contemporary political, economic, and social theoretical issues under the guidance of Marxism, as an urgent task, and put it before the whole Party. In the Party, especially among high-level cadres, we must advocate the serious study and research of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially the study and research of Marxist philosophy, to master the scientific worldview and methodology. A Communist Party member who lacks Marxist theoretical cultivation and is not good at using the correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze and solve problems cannot play the role he should play, let alone become a qualified Party leader. We must resolutely correct the situation of many leading cadres being immersed in daily affairs, relaxing theoretical study, and not paying attention to ideological and political dynamics, and truly improve the theoretical level and political sensitivity of all Party comrades.

Comrades and Friends!

The current international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue. The situation where superpowers dominate international affairs has changed greatly, and hegemony is encountering obstacles everywhere. The role of Third World countries in international affairs is increasingly strengthened. Relying on the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, it is possible to maintain lasting world peace and avoid a world war. Peace and development are the two major themes of the world today. This overall trend and pattern of the international situation have not changed. We have the possibility of securing a relatively long period of peaceful international environment for the modernization construction of China. However, we must see that the world is not peaceful, and there are still many contradictions, struggles, and unstable factors.

Here, it is necessary to point out that international reactionary forces have never given up their fundamental stance of hostility and subversion against the socialist system. Since the late 1950s, after their failure in armed intervention, they have shifted their policy focus to "peaceful evolution," using political, economic, and cultural means, taking advantage of the temporary difficulties of socialist countries and the opportunities of reform, to infiltrate, exert influence, support and buy so-called "dissidents," cultivate blind worship of the West, spread Western capitalist political models, economic models, values, and decadent ideas and lifestyles. When they think there is an opportunity, they create rumors, provoke incidents, plot turmoil, and carry out subversive activities. Although class struggle is no longer the main contradiction in our society, it still exists to a certain extent and may intensify under certain conditions. International hostile forces are precisely looking for their basis for implementing the strategy of "peaceful evolution" here. The struggle between infiltration and counter-infiltration, subversion and counter-subversion, "peaceful evolution" and "counter-peaceful evolution" is long-term. On this point, the people of all ethnic groups in the country, all comrades in the Party, especially leading cadres, must maintain a high degree of vigilance.

The evolution of post-war international relations shows that hegemony and power politics are becoming more and more untenable, and the attempt to impose one's own political, economic model, and values on others is doomed to fail. Normal state relations can only be established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others, and the Chinese people will never allow others to infringe upon their sacred right to make historical choices. We advocate the establishment of a new international political and economic order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, where all countries respect each other's independence and sovereignty, and all peoples enjoy the freedom to choose the social system, development path, and moral values they deem appropriate. Differences in social systems, ideologies, or other aspects should not be obstacles to friendly relations and economic and cultural exchanges between countries. In the past 40 years, we have established and developed diplomatic relations with countries around the world, including Western developed countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and carried out extensive economic and cultural exchanges with various countries. The Chinese people cherish these achievements and friendships with the peoples of various countries. The independent and autonomous foreign policy has not only safeguarded China's independence, sovereignty, and dignity but also enabled us to win more and more friends and gain high international prestige. We will adhere to this foreign policy and continue to contribute to the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of international cooperation. To accelerate the pace of China's socialist modernization construction, while relying on our own strength to actively develop China's economy and science and technology, we must also strive to learn from the advanced science and technology, management experience of developed countries, and effectively utilize foreign funds. We respect all foreign governments and friends who treat us equally, and will continue to develop and expand friendly cooperative relations with them. We must, while unswervingly implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world, unswervingly safeguard national sovereignty, national independence, and the dignity of the socialist motherland. Socialist China, with one-fifth of the world's population, possesses real and potential huge economic power, which is an objective reality that no one can ignore. More and more enlightened people in the international community have already realized that it is very unwise and impossible to try to exclude and isolate China. Any economic sanctions will not shake our determination to rejuvenate China and adhere to the socialist road, nor will they shake our belief in friendly coexistence with the peoples of all countries.

The armed forces of the people led by the Communist Party of China, with the People's Liberation Army as the main body, are the strong pillars of people's democratic dictatorship and the strong backing of the socialist cause. The 40 years of history, especially the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, have once again proven that without the people's army, there would be nothing for the people. The People's Liberation Army will forever be the defender of the state, the defender of socialism, the defender of the people's interests, and the iron Great Wall of the Republic. Our socialist construction is carried out in the face of international and domestic hostile forces that attempt to subvert and sabotage. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must, while concentrating on economic construction, attach great importance to and strengthen national defense construction, attach great importance to and strengthen national defense education, enhance the national defense consciousness of the whole nation, and strive to promote the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of the army.

Comrades and Friends!

In the past 40 years, our Party and government have made unremitting efforts to end the state of separation of the motherland as soon as possible and complete the great cause of unification. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the policy of peaceful reunification of the motherland and the idea of "one country, two systems" were put forward. This is our basic policy. Now, the Chinese government has reached agreements with the British and Portuguese governments to solve the problems of Hong Kong and Macao, respectively. We will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macao regions, nor will we allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the central government. With the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the Hong Kong and Macao regions will be more stable and prosperous. With the joint efforts of the people on both sides of the strait, the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan has also undergone a gratifying change. However, the authorities in Taiwan still insist on the anti-communist and non-negotiation stance, insist on the "three nos" policy, and artificially set obstacles to the normal development of cross-strait relations and friendly exchanges, implement "flexible diplomacy," create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and attempt to maintain the status quo of separation for a long time, actually inciting and encouraging the development of "Taiwan independence" forces. This is contrary to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and the common aspirations of the people on both sides of the strait. To complete the unification of the motherland, we place our hopes on the people of Taiwan and also on the authorities in Taiwan. We firmly oppose any words and actions that may lead to Taiwan's secession from the motherland. The authorities in Taiwan should follow the historical trend and make wise decisions that are beneficial to the unification of the motherland as soon as possible. We believe that as long as all patriots who understand the great cause of the nation unite and strive together, the great cause of the unification of the motherland will definitely be realized soon.

Comrades and Friends!

About a century ago, when the great leaders of the world proletariat, Marx and Engels, passed away one after another, there were not many people who believed in the scientific socialist doctrine they established. Today, socialism has become a living reality in the world and the practice of billions of people. The newly born socialist system will have twists and turns in its development process, but history has proven and will continue to prove that the socialist system has strong historical vitality and vitality. Only seeing some eddies and backwaters and not seeing the surging of the historical river can only indicate the political shortsightedness of the observer. The replacement of capitalism by socialism is the true historical trend and a decisive stage for mankind to enter the realm of freedom from the realm of necessity. At the time of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we review the past, look to the future, stand in China, and look to the world, and we are full of confidence in the socialist cause and the communist future of mankind.

Let us, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strengthen the unity with all democratic parties, non-party patriots, and all patriots, strengthen the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, invigorate the national spirit, and firmly advance along the socialist road, striving for greater victories in the socialist cause!

    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会上
    江泽民总书记的讲话
    （一九八九年九月二十九日）同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们在这里隆重集会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年。我代表中共中央和国务院，向在各条战线上为社会主义建设贡献力量的全国各族工人、农民、知识分子、各民主党派和各界爱国人士致敬！向为保卫人民共和国和社会主义事业建立了历史功勋的中国人民解放军、武警部队、人民警察致敬！向致力于统一祖国和振兴中华的港澳同胞、台湾同胞、海外侨胞致以亲切的问候！向一切同我们友好相处、支持中国现代化建设的外国朋友和世界各国人民表示衷心的谢意！
    在这里，我们还怀着崇高的敬意，深切怀念为缔造和建设社会主义人民共和国立下伟大功勋的毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德等已故老一代无产阶级革命家，深切怀念为创建和捍卫新中国而英勇牺牲的革命先烈！
    我们是在赢得制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，完满召开了党的十三届四中全会之后不久，迎来建国40周年的光辉节日的。今年春夏之交的动乱和暴乱，是国际大气候和国内小气候相结合的产物。国内外敌对势力制造这场风波，目的是推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度，使中国变成资产阶级共和国，重新沦为西方资本主义大国的附庸。这场斗争的性质是四项基本原则同资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，是关系我们党、国家、民族生死存亡的政治斗争，也是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们取得了这场斗争的胜利，保卫了一百多年来无数先烈和仁人志士为中华民族的生存和解放进行斗争的成果，保卫了半个多世纪来新民主主义革命、社会主义革命的成果，保卫了40年来社会主义建设和十年来改革开放的成果。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家，支持中央政治局常委多数的正确决策，力挽狂澜，在斗争中起了中流砥柱的作用。这场斗争的胜利，对于中国社会主义事业的发展方向、发展前途和中华民族的振兴，对于国际社会主义事业的发展，都将产生深远的影响。实践已经并将继续证明，党和政府为制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱而采取的方针和措施，使国家和人民避免了陷入严重内乱和历史倒退的巨大灾难，是符合全国各族人民的共同意志和根本利益的。赵紫阳同志犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误。我们党正是坚决纠正了他的错误，才取得这场斗争的胜利的。现在，这场斗争胜利的意义，已经被越来越多的人们所认识。我们一定要把这场斗争进行到底，教育和团结绝大多数，孤立和打击极少数敌对分子，彻底查清一切反革命阴谋活动，不留隐患，并从中吸取深刻的教训。我们完全可以断言，国外敌对势力妄想把中国变为附庸的任何企图，国内敌对势力妄想为动乱和反革命暴乱翻案的任何图谋，都将彻底破产。
    这场斗争的胜利，进一步证明了中国共产党领导中国人民选择的社会主义道路和正在进行的社会主义改革事业，在中国辽阔的大地上已经成为不可逆转的历史潮流。社会主义中国的前进和发展，是任何困难都阻挡不了的，是任何国内外敌对势力都动摇和改变不了的。
    中华人民共和国成立以来的40年，是中国历史发生翻天覆地变化的40年，是经历艰难曲折、战胜种种困难、不断发展进步的40年，是中华民族扬眉吐气、独立自主、在国际事务中日益发挥重要作用的40年。
    中华人民共和国的成立，在中国大陆上结束了几千年剥削阶级的统治，结束了长期遭受帝国主义欺凌的历史，中国人民从此成为自己国家和社会的主人。中国革命的胜利，是俄国十月革命以后国际共产主义运动历史上最重大的事件，是第二次世界大战以后世界政治中最重大的事件。这个胜利，改变了世界的政治格局，鼓舞了世界人民的革命斗争，对人类进步事业做出了重大贡献。
    我们运用马克思列宁主义的国家学说，结合中国的实际，在世界上人口最多的东方大国，建立了工人阶级领导的、工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家政权。我们实行人民代表大会制度，保证了广大人民管理国家事务、社会事务的权力和民主权利。我们实行共产党领导的、为社会主义事业和祖国统一大业共同奋斗的多党合作和政治协商制度，坚持“长期共存、互相监督、肝胆相照、荣辱与共”的方针，广泛吸收各民主党派和各界爱国人士参政议政，组成了最广泛的爱国统一战线。尽管我们的政治制度还有待于逐步完善，但是它经过自我改革和发展，一定能够为国家政治、经济、文化、社会生活的民主化，提供充分的可能性和广阔的前景。
    新中国成立后，我们仅仅用了三年时间，就治愈了战争的创伤，把国民经济恢复到旧中国历史的最高水平。在此基础上，我们实现了生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，消灭了剥削制度和剥削阶级，建立了以生产资料公有制和按劳分配为主体和基本特征的社会主义经济制度。尽管我们的经济制度还有待于逐步完善，但是它经过自我改革和发展，一定能够为进一步提高社会生产力和劳动生产率，提高全体人民的物质、文化生活水平，提供充分的可能性和广阔的前景。　　　
    我们运用社会主义的基本的政治制度和经济制度的力量，依靠各族人民发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，克服种种困难，使中国由一个一穷二白的半殖民地、半封建国家，变成了一个初步繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。1988年，我国国民生产总值已达到14015亿元，国民收入11770亿元，扣除物价因素，分别是1949年的19.8倍和18倍。我国国民生产总值已经上升到占世界的第8位，有些重要产品产量已跃居世界前列。1950年到1988年累计，全民所有制单位固定资产投资总额达21538亿元，有4393个大中型项目建成投产，新增固定资产15619亿元。现在我国已经建立了独立的、门类比较齐全的工业体系和国民经济体系。随着生产的发展，全国居民实际消费水平由1952年的每人每年76元，提高到1988年的639元，扣除物价上涨因素，平均每年增长3.7％。全国人民的温饱问题基本解决，一部分居民生活开始向小康水平迈进。我国的教育、科学、文化、卫生、体育事业也有很大发展。40年累计，普通高等学校培养本科、专科毕业生619.2万人，研究生15.4万人，等于新中国成立前37年间毕业生总数的30倍。40年来，重大科学技术研究成果层出不穷。在原子能技术、生物科学、农业科学、高能物理、计算机技术、运载火箭技术、卫星通信技术等方面，有些已达到或接近世界先进水平。国防建设取得了巨大成绩，增强了保卫祖国的实力。这些成就，为我国的社会主义现代化建设，奠定了坚实可靠的基础。
    党的十一届三中全会以来的十年，我们坚持以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，国家经济实力迅速增强，人民得到了更多的实际利益。1979—1988年，按可比价格计算，我国国民生产总值平均每年增长9.6％，超过1953—1978年每年平均增长6.1％的速度，大大高于世界上绝大多数国家年平均增长2％—4％的速度。1988年和1978年相比，进出口总额增长4倍。这十年间，扣除价格上涨因素，农民人均纯收入平均年增长11.8％，城镇居民人均收入平均年增长6.5％。十年来，城乡共新建住宅约80亿平方米。在吃、穿、用、住全面改善的基础上，城乡居民储蓄存款由1978年末的211亿元，增加到1988年末的3802亿元。这十年的巨大成就，是贯彻十一届三中全会以来路线、方针、政策的结果，也是前三十年中社会主义革命和建设成果的进一步发展。
    我们的经济发展和人民生活水平的提高，不仅同我国过去历史相比极为显著，而且同其他许多国家相比，也并不逊色。尽管我国的经济还比较落后，但毕竟取得了在过去剥削制度下无论如何也不可能取得的成就，表现了社会主义制度的优越性，全国各族人民完全有理由为自己付出辛勤劳动所创造的丰硕成果而感到由衷的喜悦和自豪！
    我们必须充分肯定中国人民在社会主义制度下取得的辉煌成就。任何怀疑、否定我们成就的观点，都是没有根据的，是错误的和有害的。同时，我们又必须充分认识和坚决纠正我们工作中的失误。不承认失误的观点，同样是没有根据的，是错误的和有害的。十一届三中全会以来，我们党恢复和发展实事求是的思想路线，坚持实践是检验真理的唯一标准，纠正“左”和右的错误，反对资产阶级自由化，重新确立和执行了马克思主义的正确路线。我们党已经对前三十年的若干历史问题做出了科学的结论。我们必须坚持这些正确的结论，并继续总结这十年来进行现代化建设和改革开放的经验教训，以求得对历史经验更全面、更深刻的认识。
    回顾四十年的历史，我们至少可以得出以下四个方面的基本结论：
    社会主义制度的确立、巩固和发展，体现了中国现代社会运动的客观规律，是中国历史上最伟大、最深刻的变革。如果不进行以社会主义为前途的人民革命，就不可能推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，不可能把黑暗的中国变成光明的中国。如果新中国建立以后不走社会主义道路，不坚持人民民主专政，就不可能维护国家的统一和民族的独立，不可能逐步实现人民共同富裕的愿望。如果今后不坚持社会主义，而是像有人主张的那样退回去走资本主义道路，用劳动人民的血汗去重新培植和养肥一个资产阶级，在我国人口众多、社会生产力水平很低的情况下，只能使大多数人重新陷入极其贫困的状态。这种资本主义，只能是原始的、买办式的资本主义，只能意味着中国各族人民再度沦为外国资本和本国剥削阶级的双重奴隶。总之，正如毛泽东同志和邓小平同志所指出的，只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。
    社会主义制度是在自身基础上不断发展和完善的制度。在社会主义条件下，我们的根本任务是以经济建设为中心，大力发展社会生产力。立足本国国情，总结实践经验，根据社会生产力的现实水平和进一步发展的客观要求，自觉调整生产关系中与生产力不相适应的部分，调整上层建筑中与经济基础不相适应的部分，这就是我们所说的社会主义改革。如果不进行这样的改革，就会窒息社会主义内在的活力和生机，就会严重妨碍社会主义优越性的发挥。十一届三中全会以后，我们党把改革开放纳入党的基本路线，开创了我国社会主义事业发展的崭新局面。十年的巨大成绩证明，改革开放的总方针、总政策是完全正确的，必须坚定不移地贯彻下去。
      发扬爱国主义精神，坚持独立自主、自力更生的方针，是中国革命也是中国社会主义建设取得胜利的一条根本经验。在当代中国，爱国主义和社会主义，本质上是统一的。历史证明，坚定捍卫中华民族尊严、期望中国繁荣昌盛的爱国者，大都会成为忠诚的社会主义者或社会主义的可靠朋友。中国人民的爱国主义和自力更生精神，是社会主义现代化建设的强大力量。我们的社会主义事业，就是在打破外国敌对势力对我国的孤立、封锁和挑衅的过程中巩固和发展起来的。中国人民从来没有、今后也决不会屈从于任何外来压力，决不会放弃社会主义道路和民族独立来换取别人的施舍。我们一贯欢迎和争取各国人民对我们事业的支持。在新的形势下，我们更加重视利用有利的国际条件，坚持对外开放，以加速我国的社会主义现代化建设。
    用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党，是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是中国各族人民利益的忠实代表，在国家独立和发展的过程中担负着极其重要的使命。中国共产党成为中国革命和建设的领导核心，是人民在长期实践中做出的正确选择。党是在战胜困难、克服失误、总结历史经验的过程中逐步成熟起来的。四十年来的成就，是在我们党的正确领导下，依靠全国人民的努力取得的。错误和挫折的发生，问题也往往主要出在党内。党的状况如何，对于国家和民族的命运具有决定性的意义。我们必须严肃地毫不留情地剖析和坚决纠正工作中的失误，解决党内存在的问题。我们必须科学地历史地总结经验，客观地全面地认识现实。只要坚持这样做，我们党一定能够不辜负人民的期望，在实现新的历史任务中写下灿烂的篇章。
    立足于以上的基本结论，我们要更加坚定不移地把马克思主义普遍真理和我国的具体实际结合起来，走自己的路，建设有中国特色的社会主义。邓小平同志关于建设有中国特色社会主义的理论，是经过十年实践检验而为亿万人民所认识和接受的科学理论，是指引我们继续前进的旗帜。在整个社会主义初级阶段，我们必须坚定不移地执行党的十三大制定的基本路线：领导和团结全国各族人民，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，自力更生，艰苦创业，为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家而奋斗。当前，我们必须同心协力，巩固和发展制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的胜利成果，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，努力实现国民经济的稳定发展。
    这里，我着重讲一下当前党和国家工作中需要特别注意统一认识的若干重要问题。
      （一）关于坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放相统一的问题。四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，这已经成为全党同志、全国各族人民的共同认识。许多事实告诉我们，在改革开放问题上，实际上存在着两种截然不同的主张。一种是党中央和邓小平同志一贯主张的坚持社会主义道路，坚持人民民主专政，坚持共产党的领导，坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想的改革开放，即作为社会主义制度自我完善的改革开放。另一种是坚持资产阶级自由化立场、要求中国“全盘西化”的人所主张的同四项基本原则相割裂、相背离、相对立的“改革开放”。这种所谓“改革开放”的实质，就是资本主义化，就是把中国纳入西方资本主义体系。我们必须明确划清两者的根本界限。当前四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，可以说在很大程度上表现在改革开放要不要坚持社会主义方向这个问题上。我们在制订和贯彻现代化建设的各项方针、政策、措施、方案的时候，都要坚持把四项基本原则和改革开放有机地统一起来，把四项基本原则具体落实到各项工作中去。我们一定要正确地、更好地实行改革开放，使我国社会主义的经济体制和政治体制进一步完善起来，以促进国民经济和其他社会事业更好更快的发展。党中央和国务院已经宣布的有关改革开放的各项政策、措施，包括经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策、措施，要继续贯彻执行并在实践中逐步加以完善。已经确定试点的改革，正在进行综合改革试验的地区，要继续试点和试验，并认真总结经验。我们要进一步发扬勇于探索、勇于创新的精神，把改革开放事业继续推向前进。
      （二）关于我国经济发展的战略部署和治理整顿问题。根据邓小平同志的提议，我们党制定了社会主义现代化经济建设大体分三步走的战略目标。第一步，实现国民生产总值比1980年翻一番，解决人民的温饱问题；第二步，实现到本世纪末国民生产总值再翻一番，人民生活达到小康水平；第三步，到下个世纪中叶，基本实现现代化，人均国民生产总值达到中等发达国家水平，人民过上比较富裕的生活。然后，在这个基础上继续前进。这个战略目标，既不是急于求成，也不是无所作为，而是符合我国实际，经过努力可以实现的。在实现这个战略目标的整个过程中，要坚持把教育放在优先发展的战略地位，把经济发展逐步转到依靠科技进步、不断提高劳动效率的轨道上来，严格控制人口增长，提高人口素质，合理利用资源，注意保护生态环境。这些都是至关重要的。现在，第一步已经基本实现，正在实现第二步，这是最关键的一步。为了完成这个任务，当前必须坚定不移地继续贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针，力争用三年或者更多一些时间，从根本上缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，逐步消除通货膨胀，使国民经济走出困境。我们当前面临的经济困难，是几年来积累下来的。对困难要有足够的估计，这比估计不足要主动得多，同时也要看到克服困难的有利条件。在前三十年建设的基础上，经过这十年来的改革开放和发展，我国经济实力有了很大的增强。经过一年来治理整顿的实践，我们的认识更趋一致。我们的发展前景是光明的。全党同志必须充分发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的精神，以身作则，同全国人民一道，过几年紧日子。在治理整顿期间，更要强调适当集中，逐步提高国家财政收入在国民收入中的比重，提高中央财政收入在国家财政收入中的比重。中央不掌握必要的财力，就不可能保证重点建设和治理整顿任务的实现。必须加强中央的权威，反对分散主义，以利于领导国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展。治理整顿绝不是倒退，绝不是不要改革。治理整顿不仅为深化改革和保证改革健康发展创造条件，而且它本身也需要改革的配合。任何把治理整顿同改革分割开来、对立起来的观点和行为都是不正确的，对治理整顿不积极也就是对改革不积极。
      （三）关于坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合的问题。我们的社会主义经济，是公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济。这种商品经济，同私有制基础上基本由市场自发调节的资本主义商品经济，有着本质的区别。在总体上自觉实行有计划、按比例地发展国民经济，是社会主义制度优越性的体现，是社会主义经济的一个基本特征。对过去那种集中过多、统得过死的计划体制，毫无疑义要进行改革。十年来，我们在实行计划指导的同时，发挥市场调节的积极作用，取得了促进国民经济发展，繁荣市场，提高人民生活水平的显著效果。当然，如果一味削弱乃至全盘否定计划经济，企图完全实行市场经济，在中国是行不通的，必将导致经济生活和整个社会生活的混乱。在当前对国民经济进行治理整顿的过程中，要更多地强调计划的指导作用，同时进一步整顿和健全市场秩序。我们要在实践中不断探索，努力创造一种适合中国情况的、把计划经济和市场调节有机结合起来的社会主义商品经济运行机制。计划经济和市场调节结合的程度、方式和范围，要经常根据实际情况进行调整和改进。这是一个重大的理论问题和实践问题。希望全党同志特别是经济工作者要为此而付出艰苦努力，以求得这个问题的逐步解决。
      （四）关于坚持公有制为主体、发展多种经济成分的问题。在我国经济发展中，我们要继续坚持以公有制为主体、发展多种经济成分的方针，发挥个体经济、私营经济以及中外合资、合作企业和外资企业对社会主义经济的有益的、必要的补充作用。坚持这个方针，是为了更好地发挥社会主义经济的优越性，促进我国经济的更快发展，绝不是要削弱或取消公有制经济的主体地位，更不是要实行经济“私有化”。非公有制经济在我国国民经济中所占比重和发展领域，要根据我国现实的生产力水平和客观需要来确定，不能简单地把它所占比重的大小作为衡量改革成绩的标志。国家要在资金、信贷、能源、原材料供应等方面支持公有制经济的发展，同时深入改革公有制企业的管理体制。全民所有制大中型企业是我国社会主义现代化建设的主要支柱，是国家财政收入的主要来源。充分发挥它们的骨干作用。对我国经济发展具有特殊重要的意义。我们既要从宏观上为它们提供必要的条件，又要鼓励它们加强企业内部的基础工作，改善经营管理，开展技术改造和技术革新，充分挖掘内部潜力，以促使它们增强自负盈亏、自我积累、自我发展、自我约束的能力，更好地发挥公有制经济的优势和主导作用。国家支持大中型国营企业的发展，也要根据产业政策和实际可能，分别轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地进行，不能平均使用力量。在我国现阶段，发展从属于社会主义经济的个体经济、私营经济，对于发展社会生产、方便人民生活、扩大劳动就业，具有重要的不可缺少的作用。十年来改革的实践，充分证明了这一点。我们的方针，一是要鼓励它们在国家允许的范围内积极发展；二是要运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，加强管理和引导，做到既发挥它们的积极作用，又限制其不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用。
      （五）关于坚持按劳分配为主体的多种分配形式，防止和纠正社会分配不公的问题。发展以公有制为主体的多种经济成分，必然要求在分配体制上实行以按劳分配为主体的多种分配形式。我们通过改革，在建立和健全这种分配体制方面，已经取得了进展。我们提倡在共同富裕的目标下，一部分人通过诚实劳动和合法经营先富裕起来。这个政策是正确的，要继续贯彻执行。同时也要看到，我国目前分配领域中存在的问题很多，有些还相当严重。一方面在企业事业单位和党政机关中靠工资收入的职工之间，平均主义的分配现象尚未完全克服，在有些地方、部门和领域中甚至还有所滋长，另一方面又出现了收入过分悬殊的新的社会分配不公。这种情况，主要表现在广大靠工资收入的职工、干部、知识分子同许多非生产领域的公司人员之间，同某些从事“第二职业”者之间，特别是同私营企业主和部分个体劳动者之间，收入的差距过大。这已经引起全社会的广泛关注和劳动群众的强烈不满。社会分配不公不仅是一个经济问题，而且是一个社会问题和政治问题。它挫伤了广大职工、干部、知识分子的积极性，助长了消费基金膨胀，特别是以投机倒把、行贿受贿、贪污盗窃等手段牟取暴利的现象，已经产生扰乱经济秩序、败坏社会风气、影响社会安定的严重后果。因此，我们必须高度重视和认真加以解决。对合法收入要予以保护，对过高收入要通过税收进行必要的调节，对非法收入要坚决取缔，同时逐步改善收入偏低的脑力体力劳动者的生活待遇。目前还有相当一部分固定资产投资和流动资金的投入，被不适当地转化为消费基金，严重影响了经济的发展和后劲，一定要坚决加以纠正。与此同时，我们还必须坚持物质鼓励与精神鼓励相结合的原则，纠正“一切向钱看”的错误倾向，以充分发挥和保护广大劳动者的积极性。
    （六）关于加强农业等基础产业和调整经济结构的问题。为了保证国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展，必须从我国现代化建设的长远战略着眼，从当前产业结构严重不合理的实际情况出发，加强基础产业，调整产业结构，努力增强我国经济和社会发展的后劲，克服追求表面繁荣的短期行为。要大力加强农业，加强能源、交通、通信、重要原材料等基础工业和基础设施，确保科学技术和教育的发展，严格控制加工工业和非生产性建设的规模与速度。为此，一定要继续压缩固定资产投资规模，严格控制消费基金增长速度，大力开展增产节约运动，逐步实现财政、信贷、外汇、主要物资的平衡。要集中财力、物力用于农业等基础产业的建设，提高整个社会的生产能力。这是我们国家的大局和各族人民的根本利益，关系到整个社会主义现代化建设的前途。因此，我们必须提倡眼前利益服从长远利益，局部利益服从整体利益，个人和集体利益服从国家利益。
    农业特别是粮食生产的稳定增长是整个国民经济发展的基础。11亿人的吃饭问题，只有依靠我们自己采取正确方针，进行持久努力，不能依靠任何别人代替我们解决。任何时候都不能忘记这个最基本的国情。发展农业，一要继续深化农村改革，执行稳定的农村政策，完善多种形式的联产承包责任制，建立和健全产前、产中、产后服务体系。同时，在有条件的地区，要根据农民自愿的原则，稳妥地推进适度规模经营。二要积极推广先进的农业科学技术成果，有计划地组织农业区域开发，发展新的生产力，使农林牧渔业全面发展。三要增加国家、地方、集体和农民对农业的投入，扩大农田水利基本建设，大力发展农用工业，改善农业生产条件，坚决纠正盲目占用和浪费耕地的现象。要在大力加强农业的前提下，继续鼓励和引导乡镇企业健康发展。乡镇企业要有计划地进行整顿，合理控制发展速度，认真调整产业结构，改善经营管理和经营作风。
      （七）关于社会主义民主和法制建设的问题。建设高度的社会主义民主和完备的社会主义法制，是我国社会主义现代化建设的一个重要目标和任务，是党和人民群众的共同愿望。建国以来特别是近十年来，我国的民主和法制建设取得了显著成就，在国家和社会生活的主要方面已经基本有法可依。同时要看到，我国的民主、法制建设仍是一项十分艰巨的任务。没有民主就没有社会主义。社会主义法制是社会主义民主的体现和保障。破坏社会主义法制，必然危害社会主义民主。要严格遵守宪法和法律。要继续完善我国的人民代表大会制度和共产党领导的多党合作与政治协商制度，建立和健全民主决策、民主监督的程序和制度，扩大同群众联系、对话的渠道，提高公民参政意识，保证广大人民的意志和利益在国家生活、社会生活中得到切实的体现。这同经济的发展一样，是我们国家长治久安、繁荣昌盛的重要保证。我们的民主法制建设必须从我国的实际出发，沿着社会主义的方向和轨道有领导有秩序地逐步进行。在这个过程中，我们可以借鉴资本主义国家的某些做法，但绝对不能照搬。我们必须划清社会主义民主与资本主义民主的界限，划清社会主义民主与极端民主化、无政府主义的界限。极少数人鼓吹所谓的“精英”政治，鼓吹政治多元化、多党制，其实质是要把广大人民群众排除在民主之外，否定共产党的领导地位，用资产阶级共和国取代社会主义的人民共和国。极端民主化与无政府主义思潮在中国有比较广泛的社会基础，对我们的事业有很大的破坏性，而且很容易为极少数反动分子所利用。我们要高度警惕和坚决抵制这种思潮的泛滥。这样做，正是为了保证绝大多数人的民主权利，保证社会主义民主和法制建设的健康发展。人民的民主和对敌对分子、反社会分子的专政是密切结合、相互统一的，只要阶级斗争还在一定范围存在，专政的职能就不能削弱。
      （八）关于社会主义精神文明建设问题。社会主义不仅要实现经济繁荣，而且要实现社会的全面进步。坚持社会主义物质文明和精神文明一起抓，是我们的基本方针。精神文明建设，说到底，是要提高全民族的素质，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人。不能设想，一个没有强大精神支柱的民族，可以自立于世界民族之林。我们要深刻吸取近几年来物质文明建设和精神文明建设一手硬一手软的教训，在努力发展物质文明的同时，切实抓好精神文明建设。发展教育和科学是百年大计，对社会生产力和民族素质的提高具有重大的深远的意义。我们的教育和科学还比较落后，更要采取有效措施，自觉地抓好这项工作。要紧密结合现代化建设和改革开放的实际，结合人们的思想实际，大力加强和改进意识形态领域的工作，加强和改进思想政治工作，坚持不懈地向全国人民特别是青少年进行爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的思想教育以及革命传统教育，对共产党员、共青团员和先进分子还要经常进行共产主义的思想教育。要用马克思主义和社会主义思想去指导理论、宣传、教育、新闻、出版、文学艺术等部门的工作，去占领思想文化阵地和舆论阵地，丰富群众的精神生活。要积极引导广大群众自觉地抵制各种错误思潮和腐朽思想的影响，培养科学的健康的文明的生活方式，使他们真正成为奋发进取的社会主义劳动者和建设者。各级各类学校不仅要建立完备的文化知识传授体系，而且要把德育放在首位，确立正确的政治方向。我们要继续坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，繁荣和发展科学文化事业。要积极吸收我国历史文化和外国文化中的一切优秀成果，坚决摒弃一切封建的、资本主义的文化糟粕和精神垃圾。当前在这个问题上，要特别注意反对那种全盘否定中国传统文化的民族虚无主义和崇洋媚外思想。
   （九）关于加强工人阶级领导、巩固工农联盟和增强全国各族人民大团结的问题。工人、农民、知识分子是社会主义现代化建设的基本力量。全心全意依靠工人阶级，是由我们党和国家的性质决定的。工人阶级特别是产业工人同现代化大生产紧密联系，是先进生产力和生产关系的代表，有高度的组织性和纪律性。在长期革命斗争和建设实践中，他们表现出了坚定的政治立场和自我牺牲精神、艰苦创业精神、历史主动精神，不愧为我们国家的领导阶级和社会主义事业的中坚。任何贬低工人阶级地位和作用的观点，都是完全错误的。极少数人企图在中国制造一个所谓“中产阶级”，作为他们的依靠力量，来颠覆我们的社会主义制度，更从反面证明了我们必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。我国广大农民历来是工人阶级的天然同盟军，是社会主义制度和党的领导的坚定拥护者。我们要进一步加强工业对农业的支援，加强城市对农村的支援，从政治、经济、教育、科学、文化等方面，不断采取切实措施，在新的基础上巩固工农联盟。这是国家和社会稳定的根本条件。我国知识分子已经是工人阶级的一部分。没有知识和知识分子，不可能建设社会主义。　我们党的这一基本观点和十一届三中全会以来的知识分子政策，没有也不会因为不久前发生的政治风波而改变。我们已经有了一支坚持走社会主义道路的很好的知识分子队伍。各级党委和政府要继续贯彻“尊重知识、尊重人才”的方针，努力为知识分子创造、提供良好的工作条件和生活条件。党和政府历来把广大青年包括青年知识分子看成是祖国的未来和希望，对他们一贯采取热情爱护和严格要求的态度，殷切地期待他们健康成长，迅速成才。我们也诚恳地希望广大知识分子特别是青年知识分子，认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，坚持同社会实践相结合，同工人、农民相结合，不断从人民的历史创造活动中汲取营养，在祖国社会主义建设中充分发挥自己的聪明才智。
    我们要在巩固工农联盟的基础上，进一步发展全体社会主义劳动者、拥护社会主义的爱国者和拥护祖国统一的爱国者的最广泛的统一战线，增强全国各族人民的团结。我国是一个统一的多民族国家。我们的一切革命、建设和改革的成果，都是全国各民族人民共同创造的。在党和政府的领导下，各民族之间不仅建立和发展了平等、团结、互助的新型关系，同时通过实行民族区域自治，保证了少数民族当家作主管理本民族内部事务的权利。少数民族地区的政治、经济、教育、文化等各项事业也得到了很大的发展。我们要坚定不移地继续贯彻执行民族平等、民族团结和各民族共同繁荣的方针。要充分信任和依靠各民族干部群众，旗帜鲜明地对一切妄图分裂祖国的阴谋活动进行坚决的斗争。要加强民族区域自治的法制建设，大力培养少数民族干部和各种专业人才，保障民族自治地方充分行使自治权利。要采取必要的措施，继续帮助和支持民族地区发展经济、教育、文化和其他事业，为逐步消除历史遗留的民族间在不同程度上存在的差距而进行长期不懈的努力。
      （十）关于加强党的建设问题。我们党是一个伟大的马克思主义政党，是保持中国政局长期稳定的决定力量，是领导各族人民建设有中国特色社会主义的坚强核心。制止动乱和平息暴乱的斗争又一次考验了我们党，证明党在总体上是好的，是坚强的。我们党是在同人民群众的密切联系中产生、发展、壮大起来的。没有人民群众的支持，党一天也不能生存。我们党成为执政党以后，党内逐渐产生了某些官僚主义、命令主义、以权谋私、腐化堕落等脱离群众的现象。这些年来，由于党的建设和思想政治工作的削弱，更加重了党内思想、作风、纪律、组织方面存在问题的严重性。我们一定要坚持“全心全意为人民服务”的宗旨，坚持理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评和自我批评的优良作风，依照党章从严治党，采取坚决有力的措施，痛下决心，排除阻力，克服各种腐败现象，恢复和发展党和人民群众的血肉联系。全党各级组织首先是党中央必须严格实行民主集中制。各级领导机构必须坚持集体领导和个人分工负责相结合的制度，健全党内民主生活，加强民主监督，防止少数人说了算，更不允许个人专断。要高度重视基层党组织的建设，改变软弱涣散状况。全体共产党员、党的干部特别是领导干部，必须严格遵守党的纪律，在言论和行动上，自觉地同党的路线、方针和决议保持一致，决不允许各行其是。
    党在理论上的提高，是党的领导的正确性、科学性的根本保证。鉴于世界和中国的许多新情况、新问题，鉴于我们党在中国社会主义建设中担负的重大责任和在国际共产主义运动中所处的重要地位，有必要把学习和研究马克思主义基本理论，在马克思主义指导下研究和探讨当代重大的政治、经济、社会理论问题，作为一项紧迫任务，提到全党面前。在党内首先是党的高级干部中，要提倡认真学习和研究马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基本理论，特别是学习和研究马克思主义哲学，掌握科学的世界观、方法论。一个缺乏马克思主义理论素养，不善于运用正确的立场、观点、方法分析和解决问题的共产党员，不可能发挥应有的作用，更不可能成为党的合格的领导干部。必须坚决纠正许多领导干部陷入日常事务、放松理论学习、不注意思想政治动态的状况，切切实实地提高全党同志的理论水平和政治敏锐性。
    同志们，朋友们！
    当前的国际形势，正在由紧张趋向缓和，由对抗转向对话。超级大国操纵国际事务的局面已经有了很大改变，霸权主义到处碰壁，第三世界国家在国际事务中的作用日益加强。依靠世界一切爱好和平国家和人民的共同努力，维护世界持久和平、避免世界大战是可能的。和平与发展是当今世界的两大主题。这种国际形势的总趋势、总格局没有改变。我们有可能为我国的社会主义现代化建设，争取到一个较长时期的和平国际环境。但是必须看到，世界并不太平，仍然存在诸多的矛盾、斗争和不稳定因素。
    这里需要强调指出，国际反动势力从来没有放弃敌视和颠覆社会主义制度的根本立场。从五十年代后期开始，他们在武装干涉的一手失败以后，就把政策重点转向“和平演变”，运用政治的、经济的、文化的手段，利用社会主义国家的暂时困难和实行改革的机会，进行渗透，施加影响，支持、收买所谓“持不同政见者”，培养对于西方的盲目崇拜，传播西方资本主义的政治模式、经济模式、价值观念以及腐朽思想和生活方式。在他们认为有机可乘的时候，就制造谣言，挑起事端，策划动乱，进行颠覆活动。阶级斗争已经不是我国社会的主要矛盾，但仍在一定范围内存在，而且在一定条件下还可能激化。国际敌对势力也正是从这里找到了他们实行“和平演变”战略的根据。渗透与反渗透、颠覆与反颠覆、“和平演变”与“反和平演变”的斗争，是长期的。对于这一点，全国各族人民、全党同志特别是领导干部，必须保持高度的警觉。
    战后国际关系的演变表明，霸权主义、强权政治已经越来越行不通了，企图把自己的政治、经济模式和价值观念强加于别国是注定要失败的。正常的国家关系只能建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上。中国人民恪守不干涉别国内政的原则，中国人民也决不能允许别人侵犯自己进行历史选择的神圣权利。我们主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立国际政治、经济新秩序，世界各国互不干涉内政，每个国家的独立和主权都应受到尊重，每个国家的人民都应享有选择自己认为合适的社会制度、发展道路和思想道德的自由。社会制度、意识形态或其他方面的不同，不应当成为国与国之间发展友好关系和进行经济文化往来的障碍。四十年来，我们在和平共处五项原则的基础上，同世界各国包括西方发达国家建立和发展了外交关系，同各国广泛开展了经济文化交流。中国人民异常珍惜这种交往的成果和同各国人民的友谊。独立自主的和平外交政策既维护了我国的独立、主权和尊严，又使我们赢得越来越多的朋友，赢得崇高的国际威望。我们要坚持这一外交政策，继续为维护世界和平和促进国际合作做出贡献。为了加速中国社会主义现代化建设的步伐，我们在依靠自己力量积极发展我国经济和科学技术的同时，要努力学习发达国家的先进科学技术、经营管理经验，积极有效地利用国外资金。我们尊重一切和我们平等交往的外国政府和外国朋友，将继续发展和努力扩大同他们之间的友好合作关系。我们必须在坚定不移地实行对外开放的过程中，坚定不移地维护国家主权、民族独立和社会主义祖国的尊严。社会主义中国拥有全世界五分之一的人口，拥有现实的和潜在的巨大经济力量，这是任何人也不能忽视的客观现实。国际上越来越多的有识之士已经认识到，企图排斥、孤立中国是很不明智的，也是根本不可能的。任何经济制裁，都丝毫不能动摇我们振兴中华、坚持社会主义道路的决心，丝毫不能动摇我们同世界各国人民友好相处的信念。
    中国共产党领导下的以人民解放军为主体的人民武装力量，是人民民主专政的坚强柱石，是社会主义事业的强大后盾。40年来的历史特别是平息反革命暴乱的斗争再一次证明，没有人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。人民解放军永远是国家的捍卫者、社会主义的捍卫者、人民利益的捍卫者，是共和国的钢铁长城。我们的社会主义建设是在国际、国内仍然存在敌对势力妄图颠覆破坏的情况下进行的。全党和全国人民在集中力量进行经济建设的同时，要十分重视和加强国防建设，重视和加强国防教育，增强全民族的国防意识，努力推进军队的革命化、现代化、正规化建设。
    同志们，朋友们！
    40年来，我们党和政府为早日结束祖国的分离状态，完成统一大业，进行了不懈的努力。中国共产党十一届三中全会以后，提出了和平统一祖国的方针和“一个国家，两种制度”的构想。这是我们的基本政策。现在，我国政府已经分别同英国、葡萄牙政府达成解决香港、澳门问题的协议。我们不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，也不允许有人利用香港作为颠覆中央政府的基地。随着祖国的日益昌盛强大，港澳地区将会更加稳定繁荣。经过海峡两岸人民的协力推动，大陆和台湾的关系也已经发生令人欣慰的变化。但是，台湾当局至今仍然坚持反共拒和的立场，坚持“三不政策”，为两岸关系的正常发展和友好来往人为地设置障碍，推行“弹性外交”，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”，力图长期维持分裂局面，实际上怂恿、助长了“台独”势力的发展。这是违背中华民族的根本利益和海峡两岸全体同胞的共同心愿的。完成祖国统一，我们寄希望于台湾人民，也寄希望于台湾当局。我们坚决反对任何可能导致台湾从祖国分离出去的言论和行动。台湾当局应该顺乎历史潮流，及早做出有利于祖国统一的明智决策。我们相信，只要一切深明民族大义的同胞联合起来，共同奋斗，祖国的统一大业一定能够早日实现。
    同志们，朋友们！
    大约一个世纪前，当全世界无产阶级的伟大导师马克思、恩格斯相继逝世的时候，相信他们所创立的科学社会主义学说的人还不是很多。今天，社会主义在世界范围内已经成为活生生的现实，成为亿万群众的实践。新生的社会主义制度在其发展过程中会有迂回和曲折，但是历史已经证明并将继续证明，社会主义制度具有强大的历史活力和蓬勃生机。仅仅看见某些旋涡和逆流而看不到历史长河的奔腾，只能说明观察者的政治短视。社会主义代替资本主义是真正的历史大趋势，是人类从必然王国进入自由王国的一个决定性阶段。在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年的时候，我们回顾过去，展望未来，立足中国，放眼世界，对社会主义事业充满信心，对人类的共产主义前途充满信心。
    让我们在中国共产党的领导下，加强同各民主党派、无党派人士和一切爱国人士的团结，加强全国各族人民的大团结，振奋民族精神，坚定地沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进，争取社会主义事业的更大胜利！
