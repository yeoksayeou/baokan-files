	Yang Shangkun Meets with Lukyanov and Says China and the Soviet Union Should Cooperate at a New Starting Point

	Beijing, September 15 (Xinhua) - Reporter Wen Xian reports: State Chairman Yang Shangkun met with a delegation from the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet led by Lukyanov this morning at the Great Hall of the People. He sincerely wished for the success of the Soviet Union's reforms.

	Yang Shangkun said, the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has a long history. Although there was a period of abnormal relations, the past is past, and the deep feelings between the two peoples remain. After reviewing Gorbachev's visit to China in May, he said, Chairman Deng Xiaoping had said during his meeting with Gorbachev that China and the Soviet Union should "end the past and open the future." Deng Xiaoping's two sentences expressed the common wish of the Chinese Communist Party and the state leadership as well as the Chinese people. Gorbachev's visit opened a new chapter in the history of Sino-Soviet relations. The two countries should cooperate with each other at a new starting point and exchange experiences.

	When talking about domestic issues in China, Yang Shangkun said, to do things well in China, we must first have a stable and united domestic environment. Therefore, we now especially emphasize stability and unity. At the same time, we must strengthen the construction of the Party's organization and enhance political and ideological education.

	He said, China is currently facing some difficulties, some of which are inevitable on the road to progress. We have confidence that we can adjust our policies in two to three years to overcome the current difficulties.

	Lukyanov said, "If everything goes smoothly, it would not be a reform."

	Lukyanov said, during their stay in Beijing, the delegation from the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet saw firsthand the friendly feelings of Chinese workers and peasants towards the Soviet people, which left a deep impression on the delegation.

	Lukyanov told Yang Shangkun that before this visit to China, Gorbachev had asked him to convey to the Chinese leadership that "his visit to China in May left a deep impression on him." Lukyanov also conveyed Gorbachev's greetings to General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders.

	Yang Shangkun also asked Lukyanov to convey his and General Secretary Jiang Zemin's greetings to Gorbachev upon his return to the Soviet Union.

　　杨尚昆会见卢基扬诺夫时说
　　中苏应在新起点上互相合作
    本报北京九月十五日讯　记者温宪报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天上午在人民大会堂会见了由卢基扬诺夫率领的苏联最高苏维埃代表团。他衷心祝愿苏联改革成功。
    杨尚昆说，中苏两国人民之间的友谊有着长久的历史，尽管中间有过一段不正常的情况，可是过去的事情已经过去了，两国人民间依然有着深厚的感情。在回顾今年五月戈尔巴乔夫主席对中国的访问后，他说，邓小平主席同戈尔巴乔夫主席会晤时曾经说过，中苏两国应该“结束过去，开辟未来”。邓小平的这两句话表达了中国共产党和国家领导人以及中国人民的共同愿望。戈尔巴乔夫主席的访问开辟了中苏关系史上的新篇章。两国应该在新的起点上互相合作，彼此交流经验。
    在谈到中国国内问题时，杨尚昆说，要把中国的事情办好，首先要有一个安定团结的国内环境。因此，我们现在特别强调安定团结。同时，要搞好党的组织建设，加强政治思想教育。
    他说，中国目前遇到一些困难，其中一些困难是在前进道路上不可避免的。我们有信心用两三年时间把我们的政策调整好，克服当前的困难。
    卢基扬诺夫说：“如果什么事情都一帆风顺，那就不是改革。”
    卢基扬诺夫说，苏联最高苏维埃代表团在北京期间亲眼看到了中国工人和农民等对苏联人民的友好感情，这给代表团留下了深刻的印象。
    卢基扬诺夫告诉杨尚昆，这次来华之前，戈尔巴乔夫主席请他告诉中国领导人，“今年五月对中国的访问给他留下了深刻的印象”，卢基扬诺夫还转达了戈尔巴乔夫主席对江泽民总书记等中国领导人的问候。
    杨尚昆也请卢基扬诺夫回国后转达江泽民总书记和他本人对戈尔巴乔夫主席的问候。
