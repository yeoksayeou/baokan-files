    Significant Breakthroughs in Oil and Gas Exploration in the East China Sea and Northern Tarim Basin
    Jiang Zemin and Li Peng Express Warm Congratulations

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th — (Correspondent Zeng Mianhua) The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has recently made significant new discoveries and breakthroughs in oil and gas geological exploration in the East China Sea and the northern part of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. Premier Li Peng, upon hearing the news, wrote on September 3rd in a report from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources: "Comrade Jiang Zemin and I are very pleased with your achievements and extend our warm congratulations!"

    Since this year, the Shanghai Marine Geological Survey Bureau of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has drilled three oil and gas exploration wells in the East China Sea — Pinghu 4 Well, Baoyunting 1 Well, and Canxue Huangyan 1 Well — all of which have successfully tested high-yield industrial oil and gas flows. Among them, Pinghu 4 Well tested nine oil and gas layers between 2,300 and 3,428 meters, with a cumulative daily production of 1,892.85 cubic meters of high-quality crude oil and 148.6 million cubic meters of natural gas, making it one of the highest-yielding wells in China's offshore exploration.

    In the northern Tarim region, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has also drilled three wells this year, each yielding high-yield industrial oil and gas flows and discovering new oil and gas-bearing areas and structures. Among them, the Shatou West Akkuduk structure Sha 18 Well, drilled to a depth of 5,157 meters, yielded a high-yield industrial condensate oil and gas flow. Based on a continuous 50-hour well blowout, it is estimated to produce 1,400 cubic meters of condensate oil and 420 million cubic meters of natural gas per day, making it the highest-yielding oil and gas well in the entire Tarim Basin to date. Sha 17 Well also experienced a strong blowout when it reached the corresponding layer. The significant breakthroughs of these two wells not only initially controlled a certain area of oil and gas reserves but also proved that the Akkuduk structure group will form another important oil and gas enrichment belt.

    东海、塔北油气勘探有突破
    江泽民李鹏表示热烈祝贺
    据新华社北京九月九日电　（通讯员曾绵华）地质矿产部东海海区和新疆塔里木盆地北部两地的油气地质勘探最近连续获得新的重大发现和突破。李鹏总理闻讯后，九月三日在地矿部一份报告中批示： 江泽民同志和我对你们获得的成就感到十分高兴，向你们致以热烈的祝贺！
    今年以来，地矿部上海海洋地质调查局在东海海区施工的三口油气探井——平湖四井、宝云亭一井、残雪黄岩一井分别试获高产工业油气流。其中平湖四井在二千三百至三千四百二十八米井段试获九层油气层，累计日产优质原油一千八百九十二点八五方，天然气一百四十八点六万方，其油气质量居我国海域探井前列。
    在塔北地区，地矿部今年又有三口井分别获得高产工业油气流，并发现新的含油气地区和新的含油气构造。其中轮台西 南阿克库勒构造沙十八井钻至五千一百五十七米时，获高产工业凝析油气流。据连续五十个小时的井喷估算，日产凝析油一千四百方、天然气四百二十万方，是目前整个塔里木盆地产量最高的一口油气井。沙十七井在钻探到相应层位后也发生强烈井喷。这两口井的重大突破，不仅初步控制了一定的含油气面积，而且证明了阿克库勒构造群将构成另一个重要的油气富集区带。
