At a time when the whole Party and the people of the whole country are implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, we welcome the 40th anniversary of our liberation. Over the past 40 years, our province has achieved tremendous successes in economic development and social progress, especially in the past 10 years of construction and reform and opening up. The province has formed a complete industrial system centered on metallurgy, machinery, petroleum, chemical, building materials, light textiles, and electronics. Technological levels have improved, economic strength has grown, and the total national output value, national income, and total industrial output value have increased by 16 times, 15 times, and 99 times respectively compared to the early days of the founding of the nation. The backward face of agricultural production has changed, and the development of science, education, culture, and health has also been tremendous. The living standards of the people have significantly improved.

In the 40-year struggle, the reason our province has achieved these successes is ultimately due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee. The Party organizations and all Communist Party members at all levels in the province have played the role of a fighting fortress and a vanguard model on all fronts. They have relied on the millions of industrial workers, led the people of the province, and resolutely implemented the Party's line, principles, and policies. They have carried forward the Party's fine tradition of hard struggle. As early as the 1950s and 1960s, the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping had visited Liaoning many times to inspect the construction of the heavy industry base, the coordinated development of the national economy, the "shortening of the agricultural leg," and the full-hearted reliance on the working class to manage enterprises, among other major issues. They provided extremely important instructions for the socialist revolution and construction in our province. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaping has proposed the guiding ideology of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the Party Central Committee has formulated the basic line of "one center, two basic points." Under the guidance of this correct line, the Party organizations at all levels in the province have bravely eliminated interference, adhered to the four cardinal principles, adhered to reform and opening up, and ensured that the various undertakings in our province have continued to progress steadily. The Party organizations and the majority of Party members at all levels in the province have firmly maintained political unity with the Party Central Committee, clearly opposed and resisted the turmoil, and prevented the few people's plot to create a large-scale turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Liaoning from succeeding, maintaining the basic stability of the situation in the province. In the process of reform and opening up, the majority of Party members have bravely explored, dared to practice, and led the masses to walk the road of common prosperity. They have taken the lead in carrying out the "double increase and double saving" movement, effectively ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of Liaoning's economy. Every time we encounter serious difficulties and the masses are in dire straits, the fighting role of the Party organization and the vanguard model role of the Party members shine brightly. The facts prove that the leadership of the Party and the vanguard model role of the Party members are the fundamental guarantee for the victory of various undertakings in our province. Over the past 40 years, we have also encountered many setbacks. The "Cultural Revolution" lasted for ten years, during which the Party organization was severely damaged, and the national economy was on the brink of collapse. Since Comrade Zhao Ziyang took over the work of the Party Central Committee, the leadership of the Party has been weakened, and the bourgeois liberalization trend has been supported and incited. As a result, the construction and reform and opening up in our province have also been affected to a certain extent.

The historical experience of the past 40 years tells us that whenever we adhere to and strengthen the leadership of the Party, our cause will be victorious and will advance; whenever we weaken and abolish the leadership of the Party, our cause will suffer setbacks and failures. Therefore, the leadership of the Party can only be strengthened and cannot be weakened. This great truth, bought with blood, we must never forget. For a period of time, some comrades, influenced by the weakening of the Party's leadership, have doubted and wavered about the position and role of the Party's leadership in the new era. They believe that with economic construction as the center, as long as there is the leadership of the state power and administrative departments, the Party is no longer the core leader; implementing the separation of party and government, emphasizing the leadership role of the Party organization will affect the authority of administrative leaders; the Party should not intervene in the work of the cultural and artistic fields, otherwise it will affect the freedom of creation and performance, etc. These views violate the four cardinal principles and do not conform to the national conditions of China and must be corrected in earnest. In all fields and at all levels, the political core role of the Party must be fully played. In recent years, the construction of the Party has been weakened, and the prestige of the Party has declined. We must make great efforts to quickly reverse this situation. We must put the strengthening of the Party's construction on the important agenda, govern the Party strictly, advocate integrity and punish corruption, and punish corruption with practical actions to win the trust of the people, further improve the Party's cohesion, attractiveness, and combat effectiveness, and accelerate the building of Liaoning into a socialist modernized base, making new contributions to the modernization construction of the whole country!

    党的领导是社会主义事业必定胜利的根本保证
    中共辽宁省委书记　全树仁
    正当全党和全国人民贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神的时候，我们迎来了解放40周年的光辉节日。40年来，我省国民经济和社会发展取得巨大成就，特别是10年建设和改革开放取得显著成效。全省已经形成了以冶金、机械、石油、化工、建材、轻纺、电子为中心的门类齐全的工业体系，科技水平提高，经济实力增长，国民生产总值、国民收入和工业总产值，分别等于建国初期的16倍、15倍和99倍。农业生产落后面貌改变，科教文卫事业也都有了巨大发展。人民生活水平显著提高。
    在40年的战斗历程中，我省所以能取得这些成就，归根到底是由于党中央的正确领导，全省各级党组织和全体共产党员在各条战线上发挥了战斗堡垒作用和先锋模范作用，紧紧依靠千万产业大军，带领全省人民，坚决地贯彻执行了党的路线、方针、政策，发扬了党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统。早在五六十年代，毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德、邓小平等老一代无产阶级革命家曾多次到辽宁视察，就重工业基地建设、协调发展国民经济、“接农业短腿”、全心全意依靠工人阶级管理企业等重大问题作出了极为重要的指示，为我省社会主义革命和建设指明了方向。党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志提出了建设有中国特色的社会主义的指导思想，党中央制定了“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线。全省各级党组织在这条正确路线的指引下，勇于排除干扰，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，保证了我省的各项事业持续稳步前进。全省各级党组织和广大党员坚定地同党中央在政治上保持一致，旗帜鲜明地抵制和反对动乱，使极少数人企图在辽宁制造大的动乱和反革命暴乱的阴谋没有得逞，保持了全省局势的基本稳定。在改革开放中，广大党员勇于探索，大胆实践，理直气壮地带领群众走共同富裕的道路，带头开展“双增双节”运动，有力地保证了辽宁经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。每当遇到严重困难、群众处于危难的关键时刻，更显示了党组织战斗堡垒作用和党员先锋模范作用的熠熠光彩。雄辩的事实证明，党的领导、党员的先锋模范作用是我省各项事业胜利的根本保证。40年来，我们也遇到过许多挫折。“文革”十年“踢开党委闹革命”，使党的组织受到严重摧残，国民经济濒临崩溃的边缘。赵紫阳同志主持党中央工作以来，淡化和削弱党的领导，支持和怂恿资产阶级自由化思潮，我们辽宁的建设和改革开放也因此受到一定的影响。
    40年来的历史经验告诉我们，什么时候坚持和加强党的领导，我们的事业就胜利，就前进；什么时候削弱和取消党的领导，我们的事业就遭受挫折和失败。因此，党的领导只能加强，不能削弱。这个用血换来的伟大真理，我们任何时候都不能忘记。一个时期以来，有些同志由于受淡化党的领导的影响，对新时期党的领导地位和作用产生了怀疑和动摇，认为以经济建设为中心，只要国家政权和行政部门的领导就行了，党不再是领导核心了；实行党政分开，再强调党组织的领导作用会影响行政领导人的权威；党不应介入文化艺术领域的工作，否则会影响创作、表演自由等等。这些观点违背了四项基本原则，也不符合中国国情，必须切实加以纠正。在各个领域、各个层次，都要充分发挥党的政治核心作用。近几年来，党的建设受到削弱，党的威信有所降低，我们必须花大力气迅速扭转这种局面。我们要把加强党的建设放在重要日程，从严治党，倡廉肃贪，惩治腐败，用实际行动取信于民，进一步提高党的凝聚力、吸引力和战斗力，加速把辽宁建设成为社会主义现代化的基地，为全国社会主义现代化建设作出新的贡献！
