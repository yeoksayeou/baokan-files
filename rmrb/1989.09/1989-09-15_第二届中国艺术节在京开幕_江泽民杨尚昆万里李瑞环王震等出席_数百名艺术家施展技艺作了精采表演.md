The second Chinese Art Festival, which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, opened tonight with a chorus singing "Ode to the Motherland." Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, Li Ruihuan, and Wang Zhen attended the opening ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People.

Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and State Councilor, and chairman of this year's art festival, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, first expressed his highest respect to the broad masses of cultural and artistic workers who have contributed to the prosperity of China's cultural and artistic undertakings. He called on cultural and artistic workers to continue the long-term struggle against bourgeois liberalization, ensure the healthy development of cultural and artistic undertakings, and continue to firmly adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. He urged efforts to promote the further prosperity of culture and art (full text to be published separately).

Hundreds of artists showcased their skills at tonight's opening ceremony. The large-scale folk dance "Hua Feng Xiang Qing" expressed the artists' deep affection for history, nationality, and traditional culture. The colorful acrobatics won the applause of nearly 10,000 spectators present. The young performers' solid basic skills and rich expressive power showed the encouraging situation of China's cultural and artistic teams having successors. The Italian Veneto Soloists also performed Western classical music with exquisite skills. Chinese artists sang Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, "Ode to Joy." The festival organizers said this shows that we will continue to cherish the excellent heritage in the world's cultural treasury and have the determination to make Chinese culture and art go to the world. The evening ended with the song "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China."

Before the opening ceremony, central leaders wearing the festival badge met with the artists. Among the artists were the famous conductors Qiu Li and Chen Zuoyang, singers Liu Weiwei who won honors in international competitions in recent years, acrobats Zhao Binna and Wang Dan, young students from the Beijing Dance Academy, and the 6-year-old actor Xiaomi who won the gold medal in the World Acrobatics Competition in France earlier this year.
