The development of rubber plantations has been astonishing. With Hainan as the main base, China's rubber area and production rank fourth in the world, overturning the international consensus that rubber cannot be planted north of the 17th parallel.

	Reported by our newspaper: After 37 years of arduous struggle, Hainan Island, which had only a few scattered rubber plantations at the time of liberation, has now become the largest and most renowned natural rubber production base in the country.

	When New China was just born, rubber production in Hainan Island was almost non-existent. To break the economic blockade imposed by the United States and other Western countries, a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was transferred to Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong in 1952. Together with some local workers, they formed a reclamation army and turned the first page of China's history of large-scale natural rubber planting. Thirty-seven years later, Hainan Reclamation has developed into 89 state-owned farms, employing 478,000 workers, with 3.7 million acres of rubber plantations and 95 million rubber trees. Including rubber planted by farmers, the total rubber planting area exceeds 5 million acres, making it the largest natural rubber production base in the country. Last year, it produced over 150,000 tons of dry rubber, accounting for 66% of the national total. With Hainan as the main base, China's rubber area and production rank fourth in the world.

	The international consensus is that rubber cannot be planted north of the 17th parallel. Through years of production practice and scientific experiments, experts from the South China Institute of Tropical Crops and the Institute of Rubber Cultivation in Hainan, along with reclamation workers, have developed a set of Chinese-characteristic rubber tree cultivation techniques for moving rubber trees northward to the edge of the tropics. They successfully planted rubber trees on a large scale in the vast areas between 18°10'N and 20°10'N in Hainan, overturning the international consensus that rubber cannot be planted north of the 17th parallel. This achievement caused a sensation in the rubber-planting countries of the world. In 1982, this achievement won the National Invention Award of the First Class.

	At the beginning of liberation, the rubber industry in Hainan had no professional technical personnel, and seeds and technology were all introduced from Malaysia. The yield per acre of dry rubber was only about 10 to 20 kilograms. Over the past 30 years, Hainan has cultivated a large number of rubber professional and technical talents, including internationally renowned rubber experts such as He Kang and Huang Zongdao. Currently, the Hainan Reclamation Bureau alone has 3,241 rubber professional and technical personnel, including 199 senior titles and 797 intermediate titles. This group of technical personnel and the Hainan Reclamation Army, through self-reliance and striving for progress, have successfully developed a number of scientific research projects, including the "world's first" rubber flower bud test-tube seedlings, rubber flower bud haploid test-tube seedlings, micro-meteorological observation in rubber plantations, new technology for inducing rubber tree triploids, and rubber tree yield prediction during the seedling period, all of which are at the forefront of the world. In recent years, technical personnel have also bred high-yield new varieties such as Hai Reclamation No. 1 to No. 6, which are highly adaptable, in response to the frequent typhoons and low temperatures in Hainan. Hainan Reclamation uses high-yield varieties to update low-yield rubber plantations, establishing a second-generation rubber plantation of 560,000 acres. After just four or five years of tapping, the yield per acre has increased from the previous 40 kilograms to over 80 kilograms.

	In recent years, experts from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, as well as from Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries, have successively visited Hainan to observe the rubber plantations and believe that the growth and management of rubber in Hainan have reached world-class standards.

### 橡胶基地发展惊人　以海南为主体的我国橡胶面积、产量居世界第四位　用事实推翻北纬17°以北不能种植橡胶的国际定论

　　橡胶基地发展惊人
　　以海南为主体的我国橡胶面积、产量居世界第四位
　　用事实推翻北纬17°以北不能种植橡胶的国际定论
    本报讯　经过37年的艰苦奋斗，解放初期只有少许零星胶林的海南岛，如今已成为全国最大的、举世瞩目的天然橡胶生产基地。
    新中国刚刚诞生时，海南岛橡胶的生产几乎是一项空白。为了打破美国等西方国家的经济封锁，中国人民解放军某部1952年转业到海南岛和广东的雷州半岛，与当地部分民工组成农垦大军，掀开了我国大规模种植天然橡胶历史的第一页。37年后，海南农垦已发展到89个国营农场，拥有职工47.8万人，橡胶园370多万亩，橡胶树9500多万株。加上农民种植的橡胶，种胶面积逾500万亩，成为全国最大的天然橡胶生产基地，去年产干胶15万多吨，占全国的66％。以海南为主体的我国橡胶面积、产量已居世界第四位。
    北纬17°以北不能种植橡胶，是国际上公认的论断。经过多年的生产实践与科学实验，位于海南的华南热带作物学院、研究院的橡胶栽培专家和海南农垦职工摸索出一套具有中国特色的橡胶树北移至热带边缘的栽培技术，在海南北纬18°10′—20°10′的广大地区大面积种植成功，推翻了北纬17°以北不能种胶的国际定论，在世界植胶国引起轰动。1982年，这一成果荣获国家创造发明一等奖。
    解放初期，海南植胶业没有一个专业技术人员，种子、技术都是从马来西亚引进的，亩产干胶只有一二十公斤。30多年来，海南培养了一大批橡胶专业科技人才，其中还涌现出像何康、黄宗道这样在国际上声名赫赫的橡胶专家。目前，仅海南农垦总局，就有各类橡胶专业科技人员3241人，其中高级职称199人，中级职称797人。这批科技人员和海南农垦大军自力更生，奋发图强，研制成功一大批科研项目，其中“世界第一株”橡胶花药试管苗、橡胶花药单倍体试管苗植株、橡胶园微气象观测、橡胶树三倍体诱导新技术、橡胶树苗期产量预测等项目居世界领先地位。这些年，科技人员还针对海南台风多、低温等情况，选育出海垦1号至6号等适应性强的高产新品种。海南农垦运用高产品系进行橡胶树低产胶园更新，建立第二代胶园56万亩，才开割四五年，亩产就由过去的40公斤上升到80多公斤。
    近年来，联合国粮农组织以及马来西亚、泰国等国的橡胶专家相继来到海南参观胶园，认为海南橡胶的生长、管理达到了世界第一流水平。　（张松林）
