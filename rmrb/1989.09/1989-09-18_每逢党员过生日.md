	Every time a party member has a birthday, the party branch of the Hebei Province Handan Cotton Mill No. 1 holds a meeting to both celebrate and evaluate the member. Out of the more than 750 party members in the mill, over 300 have had their birthdays celebrated in this manner.

	On their birthdays, party members first review their performance over the past year against the standards set by the party constitution. They reaffirm their oaths and recall the evaluations given by their introducers and the party organization when they joined. Fellow participants then openly discuss their opinions. Since this activity began a year ago, good deeds among party members have become more frequent. In July alone, party members in the mill performed over 2,000 good deeds.

　　每逢党员过生日
    河北省邯郸棉纺一厂有一个制度：每逢党员过生日，党小组都要召开会议，既祝贺也评议。该厂750多名党员中，已有300余名过了生日。
    过生日的党员先按照党章中规定的党员要求，逐条对照一年来的得失，重温入党誓言和入党时介绍人及党组织对自己的评价，参加活动的同志开诚布公地提意见。开展这个活动一年来，党员中的好人好事明显增多。仅7月份，全厂党员办好事就达2000多件。　　　　邹合花
