Editor's Note: How to accelerate the development of highway transportation? Recently, the Economic Department of this newspaper invited relevant officials and experts from the State Planning Commission, the Center for Economic and Technological Development under the State Council, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Communications, and other units to hold a symposium. Their speeches will be excerpted and published in installments.

Key Points of This Issue:
- The discussion on developing highway transportation aims to improve the country's comprehensive transportation capacity.
- In the short term, fewer new roads should be built, and limited funds and resources should be used to upgrade and renovate existing roads.
- The key to developing highway transportation lies in adjusting policies.

Improving Comprehensive Transportation Capacity
Wang Zhan Yi, Vice Minister of Communications

The discussion on developing highway transportation is based on improving the overall transportation capacity of the country and meeting the needs of the national economy. It is also based on improving economic and social benefits. From the perspective of the transportation department, it is not about emphasizing the importance of highways while excluding other modes of transportation. In China, at least in the next 20 to 30 years, there will not be a situation where one mode of transportation replaces another. According to current calculations, highways can only build about 300 kilometers of expressways and first-class roads per year, and several thousand kilometers of second-class roads. Therefore, for a considerable period, China's various modes of transportation will complement each other and jointly contribute to alleviating transportation bottlenecks and meeting the needs of the national economy. The general policy is that I agree with this view: several modes of transportation should be planned comprehensively, reasonably divided, and developed in a coordinated manner, leveraging their strengths and avoiding their weaknesses, to improve the overall transportation capacity of the country and meet the needs of the national economy. For a considerable period, all five modes of transportation in our country need to have a certain degree of development.

To solve the problem of highway development, investment must be increased. It is not realistic to expect the state to provide a large amount of money in the short term. However, there is one point: 25% of the energy and transportation fund and adjustment fund collected from road maintenance fees, and 10% of the adjustment fund collected from vehicle purchase fees, were originally designated by the State Council for specific use in developing highways. Now, part of this money has been diverted and not fully used for highways. I suggest that this part should be fully used for highways. Except for national defense and border highways, where the state provides some funding, road maintenance fees and vehicle purchase fees should all be used for road maintenance and construction. With the active participation of local authorities, the appearance of highways will gradually improve. If this problem is not solved, the units that purchase vehicles will pay a portion of the money when buying cars and another portion when driving on roads. If this money is not used to improve the roads but is used for other purposes, and additional fees are collected, it will increase the additional burden on the vehicle-purchasing units, effectively constraining the development of automobile transportation. Currently, the poor condition of highways results in significant waste in automobile transportation each year, which also constrains economic development. Another issue is the land occupation tax, which is exempted for railways and civil aviation airports but not for highways. Highways directly serve the broad masses and agricultural and industrial production, so it is hoped that they can be treated the same as railways and airports. If these issues can be resolved and the enthusiasm of local authorities and the masses can be fully mobilized, the transportation department can work hard to improve the backward appearance of highways more quickly.

### 要提高综合运输能力

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    编者按：如何加快公路运输的发展？日前，本报经济部邀请国家计委、国务院经济技术社会发展中心、国家科委、交通部等单位的有关负责同志和专家、学者座谈。现将他们的发言，分期摘要刊登。
    本期要点：
    ▲讨论发展公路运输，目的在于提高国家综合运输能力
    ▲近期要少建新路，把有限资金、有限物力用于旧路的改造升级
    ▲发展公路运输关键在于调整好政策
    要提高综合运输能力
    交通部副部长　王展意
    讨论发展公路运输问题，是立足于提高整个国家综合运输能力，适应国家经济需要来考虑的，也是从提高经济效益、社会效益出发的。从交通部门来说，并不是说讨论公路重要，而排斥其它运输方式。在中国，起码在近二三十年内，不存在这种运输方式挤掉那种运输方式的问题。按照现在测算，从公路来讲，一年也只能建汽车专用路和一级路三百多公里，二级公路几千公里。所以在相当长的时间内，中国的几种运输方式，是相辅相成，共同为缓解运输的紧张状况，适应国民经济发展需要做出贡献。总的方针，我赞成这个观点，即：几种运输方式统筹规划，合理分工，扬长避短，协调发展，以提高我国整个的运输能力，适应国民经济的需要。在相当长的时间内，我国的五种运输方式都要有一定的发展。
    要解决公路发展问题，必须增加投资，在短期内要国家拿很多钱不现实。但是有一条，就是养路费交的25％的能源交通基金和调节基金，车购费交的10％的调节基金，国务院原来定的是专款专用，用于发展公路，现在收走了一块，就没有全部用到公路上去。建议把这一块都用到公路上，除了国防、边防公路国家拿一定的钱外，养路费、车购费都用于养护、修建公路，再加上地方的积极性，公路的面貌也会逐步得到改变。如果这个问题不解决，用车单位买汽车时交了一部分钱，跑车交养路费，这部分钱不都拿来改善公路，而去干别的，再收别的费，就增加了用车单位的额外负担，事实上是制约了汽车运输的发展。现在公路路况不好，每年在汽车运输上造成的浪费是很大的，同时也制约了经济的发展。另一笔是耕地占用税，铁路、民航机场免交，而公路要交，公路是直接为广大群众服务，为工农业生产服务，希望能和铁路、机场一样对待。如果这类问题能够解决，同时充分发挥地方和群众的积极性，交通部门努力做好工作，改变公路的落后面貌就会快一些。
