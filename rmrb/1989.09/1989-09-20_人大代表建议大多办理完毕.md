Most Proposals from NPC Deputies Have Been Processed

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 19 (Reporter Liú Sīyáng) – The Liaison Bureau of the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Yang Fēngchūn, said today that by August 31, 91% of the proposals from NPC deputies have been processed.

It is understood that during the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, deputies submitted a total of 3,778 proposals, criticisms, and suggestions, and 411 motions, of which 337 were converted into proposals for handling.

The General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress believes that this year's handling of deputies' proposals has been faster and of higher quality compared to previous years. Most handling units have treated this work as an important task for strengthening socialist democracy and legal system construction. However, a few handling units still do not pay enough attention to this work, and issues that could have been handled were not dealt with promptly.

The General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held a meeting today to discuss the handling of deputies' proposals. The Ministry of Finance and other units introduced their experiences in handling deputies' proposals. Some units that did not complete the handling on time explained the reasons and expressed their commitment to completing the handling by the end of September and responding to the deputies.

    全国人大常委会办公厅认为，今年人大代表建议的办理比往年速度快、质量高，大多数承办单位都能把这项工作作为加强社会主义民主与法制建设的一项重要工作来对待。但也有少数承办单位对办理工作仍重视不够，本来能够办理的问题没有抓紧办理。
