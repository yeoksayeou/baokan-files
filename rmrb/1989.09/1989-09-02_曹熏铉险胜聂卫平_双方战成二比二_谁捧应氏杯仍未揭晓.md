Today, Chinese Go master Nie Weiping lost to South Korean Go master Cao Xunqiu by 1 point in the fourth match of the Ing Cup Go tournament. The series is now tied at 2-2, and the decisive fifth match will be held on September 5th in the same location.

The two 9-dan masters, Nie and Cao, began their match at 10 AM. The only people present in the match room, aside from the referee Hua Yijang (from China), were two recorders. The match, which lasted 318 moves, concluded at 6:05 PM. Cao Xunqiu turned the tables from a disadvantageous position to secure a victory.

In this match, Nie Weiping played white and focused on securing territory. Cao Xunqiu, playing black, had the burden of playing a 8-point attachment and aimed to capture external influence. By the mid-game, Nie Weiping had a slight advantage. By the 93rd move, Cao Xunqiu had used up his allotted 3 hours and entered the reading phase. At this point, Nie Weiping still had 1 hour and 23 minutes remaining.

At noon, the match was paused for lunch. Cao Xunqiu ate with his teammates, while Nie Weiping had only watermelon.

In the afternoon, the competition for territory and influence intensified. In the observation room, the strategists from China and South Korea were intently watching and analyzing the match. Chen Zude, the head of the Chinese Go Association, was counting the stones while watching, saying, "The outcome hinges on half a stone." In the endgame, Nie Weiping made a mistake, allowing Cao Xunqiu to seize the opportunity and escape his disadvantageous position. The door to the match room finally opened, revealing Cao Xunqiu leaning against a sofa, smiling lightly as he exhaled smoke. Next to him, the ashtray had over 50 cigarette butts, most of which were barely smoked. Nie Weiping's ashtray had over 20 cigarette butts, all smoked to the filter. Nie Weiping, with a serious expression, said to Chen Zude, who approached him, "I lost by half a stone." After speaking, he buried his head in reviewing the match.

    曹熏铉险胜聂卫平  双方战成二比二
    谁捧应氏杯仍未揭晓
    本报新加坡9月2日电　今天，中国棋圣聂卫平在应氏杯围棋决战的第4盘对局中，负于南朝鲜棋圣曹熏铉1点。这样，双方前4盘战成2比2，第5盘最后一战于9月5日仍在这里进行。
    聂、曹两位九段高手今天上午10点开战，棋室内除裁判长华以刚（中国）外，只有两位记录员，其他人免入。双方经过318手较量，在傍晚6点零5分方见高低。曹熏铉从劣势中扭转战局，反败为胜。
    这盘棋聂卫平执白，开局后以占地为主要策略。曹熏铉执黑，有贴8点的负担，他以取外势围攻。战至中盘，聂卫平略占上风。曹熏铉下至第93手已用完规定的3小时，进入读秒。此时聂卫平还剩1小时23分钟。
    12点午饭时封盘，曹熏铉在队友陪伴下进餐，聂卫平则只吃西瓜。
    下午，双方抢地争势的竞争越来越激烈。观棋室内，中国和南朝鲜的智囊团也在紧张地注视、研究对局。中国围棋协会负责人陈祖德一边看一边数子，他说，两人胜负就在一子半子之间。聂卫平在终盘收官阶段犯错误，让曹熏铉抓住机会摆脱被动。对局房间的门终于打开，只见曹熏铉靠着沙发，含笑轻轻地吐着烟。他旁边烟灰缸中的烟头有50多个，大多只吸几口。聂卫平的烟缸里有20余根烟头，根根抽到尽。聂卫平面色凝重地对走过来的陈祖德只说一句：“我输了一子。”说罢，埋头复盘。
