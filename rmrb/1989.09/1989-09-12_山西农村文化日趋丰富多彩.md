Rural culture in Shanxi is becoming richer and more colorful. The People's Daily reported from Taiyuan on September 12 that as the National Day approaches, Shanxi Province's rural cultural activities are thriving, with a large number of excellent programs emerging.

This year, Shanxi has strengthened and improved its four-level cultural activity network in rural areas, with over 10,000 cultural specialist households, forming a broad stage. Rural cultural workers, adhering to the principle of leveraging local advantages, maintaining characteristics, and innovating, have vigorously promoted folk dances, songs, and artistic forms that are popular and healthy among farmers. They have collected over 210 types of folk dances and more than 15,000 folk songs. Traditional performances such as "Errenzhatai," "Xiaohair," "local yangge," "flower drum," "back stick," and "kicking drum" have all seen new developments.

Since 1988, Shanxi has held over 430 training sessions for rural cultural activity cadres, with more than 13,000 participants. In recent years, the province has also organized activities such as the "Provincial Folk Art Exhibition," the "Provincial Folk Paper-Cutting Competition," and the "Shanxi Provincial Folk Art Festival."

    今年以来，山西农村巩固和健全了四级文化活动网络，文化专业户有1万多个，形成一个广阔阵地。广大农村文化工作者本着发挥本地优势、保持特色、推陈出新的方针，大力提倡农民喜闻乐见、健康向上的文艺节目和艺术形式，已收集民间舞蹈210多种、民歌15000余首。传统的“二人台”、“耍孩儿”、“地方秧歌”、“花鼓”、“背棍”、“踢鼓子”等，都有新的发展。
    1988年以来，山西已举办430多期农村文化活动骨干训练班，受训的人员达1.3万多人。近几年还举办了“全省民间美术展览会”、“全省民间剪纸大汇剪”、“山西全省民间艺术节”等活动。
