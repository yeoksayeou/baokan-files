I have had a close working relationship with Comrade Li Kenong throughout our history, and we were close friends before his passing. After Kenong's death, I have always wanted to write something in his memory. This year, on September 15th, it is exactly his 90th birthday, which brings back many memories of this tested and proven revolutionary of the proletariat, an outstanding social activist and diplomat, a loyal communist warrior, and an excellent organizer and leader of our party and army's intelligence and security work.

Kenong has been gone for 27 years, but his image and revolutionary achievements are always in my mind. Kenong once said, "In my life, I have done two things: one is being the 'bodyguard' of the Party Central Committee, and the other is being the 'vanguard' of the united front." Although this was a modest statement, it reflects his brilliant life. Throughout his long revolutionary career, he remained steadfast in his loyalty to the Party's cause. His revolutionary courage and extensive knowledge, his organizational and leadership abilities, and his social experience made him often entrusted with tasks in times of danger. However, he always completed his tasks creatively with his unlimited loyalty to the Party and a high sense of responsibility. Whether in the enemy's camp under white terror or in the tumultuous years of marching north and south, whether in the heated negotiations or in the covert battles, he always worked diligently, selflessly, and fearlessly. Especially in intelligence and security work, he fully utilized his unique talents, ensuring the safety of the Party Central Committee in critical moments and providing decisive intelligence to the Party Central Committee, making great contributions to the Chinese revolution.

Kenong was born in Chao County, Anhui Province, on September 15, 1899. In his youth, he was influenced by democratic revolutionary thoughts. During the May Fourth Movement, he participated in the vigorous New Culture Movement. After the May 30th Movement in 1925, he and comrades such as A Ying and Wang Shaochun established Min Sheng Middle School in Wuhu, uniting progressive figures, actively spreading revolutionary ideas, and carrying out anti-imperialist and anti-feudal activities. In 1926, he joined the Communist Party of China in Wuhu. In 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek launched the April 12th counter-revolutionary coup, he, with great revolutionary courage, continued the struggle under the white terror.

In the spring of 1928, according to the Party's instructions, Kenong secretly moved to Shanghai. He first worked with comrades such as Pan Hannian on revolutionary cultural activities and served as the propaganda commissioner of the Party's Hu Zhong District Committee. In 1929, when Chiang Kai-shek intensified his destruction of our Party and the encirclement and suppression of the Red Army, aiming to completely eliminate the revolutionary forces, the Party dispatched Kenong, along with Qian Zhongfei and Hu Di, to infiltrate the Nationalist Party's spy headquarters, the Central Organization Department's Investigation Bureau, and the Shanghai Wireless Management Bureau, utilizing Xu Enzeng's expansion of the spy organization to penetrate the enemy's vital departments and assume important positions. They established a special Party cell within the enemy, with Kenong as the leader. They fought bravely to safeguard the safety of the Party Central Committee, resist enemy sabotage, warn the Party's underground organizations, rescue captured comrades, fight against traitors, carry out anti-enemy intelligence work, and made significant contributions to the Party.

In April 1931, the head of the Central Special Service, Gu Shunzhang, was captured and betrayed in Wuhan. The Party Central Committee's address and the whereabouts of the central leaders were known to Gu. The enemy planned to use Gu Shunzhang to capture the entire Party Central Committee. At this critical moment, Kenong received an urgent report from Qian Zhongfei, sent from Nanjing overnight, that Gu Shunzhang had been captured and betrayed. He remained calm and alert, using every means to find Chen Gong and report to the Party Central Committee. At that time, the responsible comrade of the Party Central Committee, Zhou Enlai, immediately discussed the strategy with Chen Yun. With the assistance of Nie Rongzhen, Chen Gong, Li Kenong, Li Qiang, and others, they wisely and decisively engaged in a heart-pounding battle against the enemy for time, taking a series of emergency measures to ensure the safe transfer of the Party Central Committee, completely foiling the enemy's evil plot to destroy our Party Central Committee. At the same time, Kenong, with a spirit of self-sacrifice, disregarding the enemy's pursuit and without considering the safety of his own family, personally arranged for the safe transfer of his comrade Qian Zhongfei and his family, as well as Hu Di. He and his comrades made outstanding contributions to safeguarding the safety of the Party Central Committee and the underground Party organizations, receiving commendations from the Party Central Committee. Chairman Mao once said: Comrades Li Kenong, Qian Zhongfei, and others have made great contributions. If it were not for them, many central comrades, including Zhou Enlai, would not have survived.

In the autumn of 1931, Kenong was ordered to leave Shanghai and go to the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area to work. He successively served as the director of the Executive Department of the State Political Protection Bureau, the director of the Political Protection Bureau of the First Front Army of the Red Army, and the director of the Red Army Work Department, establishing the Party's security and intelligence work. He made significant achievements in assisting the Red Army in the Soviet Area to crush the enemy's "extermination campaigns" and in developing and consolidating the Soviet power.

In October 1934, Kenong participated in the Long March of 25,000 miles. During the Long March, he led the reconnaissance troops to conduct ground reconnaissance along the way and served as the garrison commander of the Central Column's station, playing an important role in safeguarding the safety of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao during the Long March. He also assisted Ye Jianying in resolutely fighting against Zhang Guotao's plot to split the Party Central Committee.

In 1935, after the Red Army arrived in Shaanxi, the Party decided to implement the policy of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, proposing the slogan "Stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan," which was supported by the people nationwide. At that time, Kenong was appointed as the director of the Central Liaison Bureau of the Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the personal supervision of Zhou Enlai, Kenong was entrusted to represent our Party and twice went deep into the Northeast Army to carry out work. In Luochuan, he held an initial secret meeting with General Zhang Xueliang. He introduced our Party's policy and proposals for uniting to resist Japan to the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army, exposed Chiang Kai-shek's plot to surrender to foreign powers and eliminate internal dissidents, and used numerous facts to explain that the Northeast Army had no way out except to unite with our Party to resist Japan. This had a profound impact on the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army. He reached five oral agreements with the Northeast Army and established radio contact. Chairman Mao praised, "Li Kenong, single-handed, did a great job." Later, he accompanied Zhou Enlai to negotiate with Zhang Xueliang in Yan'an, achieving success. After the Xi'an Incident, Kenong served as the secretary-general of the Communist Party delegation, accompanying Zhou Enlai to work for the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, to save the nation from crisis, to strive for the formation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and to establish the Xi'an Red Army Liaison Office, doing a lot of hard work.

Before the July 7th Incident in 1937, Kenong left Xi'an for Shanghai to serve as the director of the Communist Party's Shanghai Office, working on the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. After the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, he was transferred to Nanjing to establish the Eighth Route Army Office, serving as the director. He assisted Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying in completing many urgent and heavy tasks. He helped restore and establish local Party organizations. He rescued and released hundreds of Communist Party members and progressive figures from Kuomintang prisons, sending them to Yan'an or dispatching them to work in Kuomintang areas. He rushed hundreds of tons of supplies from Shanghai and Nanjing to Xi'an. Before Nanjing fell, he went to Wuhan to set up the Eighth Route Army Office and served as the secretary-general of the Central Yangtze Bureau of the Communist Party and the secretary-general of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, doing a lot of hard and meticulous work, making our Party's political influence increasingly expand, and widely carrying out the Anti-Japanese National United Front. Before Wuhan fell, in extremely difficult circumstances, Kenong commanded and led the office and a large number of personnel from the New China Daily to retreat and do good dispersal work. In the winter of 1938, after Wuhan and Guangzhou fell one after another, the Kuomintang government moved to Chongqing, and Guilin became an important channel for communication with South China, East China, Southwest, and even Hong Kong and overseas. Kenong, under the instructions of Zhou Enlai, went to Guilin to establish the Eighth Route Army Office, making our Party have an open representative organization and leadership core in the Southwest. During this period, Kenong actively carried out united front work with the Kuomintang Guiliu faction, uniting people from all sides, creating a relatively good political situation of cooperation to resist Japan in Guilin. He also contacted cultural and artistic figures such as Xia Yan to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda work, promoting the development of progressive cultural work. At that time, the political situation in Guilin was very complex, especially after the Kuomintang launched the second wave of anti-communist campaigns. Facing the dangerous situation, Kenong was fearless, calm, and daring to fight. He actively carried out upper-level united front work, exposing the enemy's tricks, striving for the sympathy and support of all sectors of society for our Party; at the same time, he quickly organized the dispersal of personnel and carefully deployed underground work, preparing to maintain the foothold of anti-Japanese and national salvation even after the office was abolished.

After the January 1941 "New Fourth Army Incident," Comrade Li Kenong was ordered to return to Yan'an and take charge of the Party's intelligence and security work, successively serving as the deputy director and director of the Central Social Affairs Department of the Communist Party of China, and the deputy director and director of the Central Intelligence Department of the Communist Party of China.

In July and August 1941, the Party Central Committee issued the "Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit" and the "Decision on Investigation and Research." This was a turning point in the history of the Party's intelligence work, marking the transition from collecting alarm and protective intelligence to collecting military and political strategic intelligence. Kenong seriously studied and resolutely implemented the Central Committee's decisions, using Chairman Mao's teachings of "no investigation, no right to speak" and "subjectivism is a manifestation of impure party spirit" to educate cadres, emphasizing that intelligence work is about conducting investigation and research, a highly scientific form of struggle. He mobilized all comrades to seriously conduct investigations and research on the enemy, friends, ourselves, and foreigners, establishing the correct view of investigation and research and intelligence work, and launching a wave of understanding the situation and emphasizing reality, raising intelligence work to the level of theoretical, ideological, and political principles.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Kenong participated in the construction of secret intelligence organizations in various places, sending our intelligence personnel to infiltrate the Party, government, military, and special agencies of the Japanese, puppet, and Kuomintang, obtaining a large amount of military and political strategic intelligence from the Japanese and puppet forces and the Kuomintang's passive resistance and active anti-communist intelligence, playing an important role in assisting the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

Kenong had the foresight of a proletarian revolutionary. As the Anti-Japanese War was about to end, he considered the danger of civil war, instructing comrades working in enemy-occupied areas not to be intoxicated by victory, to plan for the long term, and to make full use of the Kuomintang's takeover of enemy-occupied cities and other favorable opportunities to actively develop into various regions of the Kuomintang. He also instructed local intelligence organizations to focus on military intelligence and to do a good job of upper-level liaison work with various factions of the Kuomintang.

In January 1946, the Kuomintang was forced to sign the "Ceasefire Agreement" with our Party and established the "Military Adjustment Execution Department" in Beiping. Kenong served as the secretary-general of the Communist Party delegation, assisting Ye Jianying in fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries and the American imperialists' plot to launch a civil war. At the same time, in view of the imminent civil war, he made arrangements for the underground intelligence organizations in North China, Northeast China, and East China.

During the War of Liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and with Kenong specifically in charge, our Party and army's intelligence work was further developed. To assist the victory of the War of Liberation nationwide, our intelligence personnel infiltrated the Kuomintang's secret decision-making and command organs, providing the Party Central Committee and the Military Commission with important military and political strategic and directional intelligence in a timely and accurate manner, providing important basis for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to study the situation and formulate the strategic guidelines for the War of Liberation. This enabled our army to have a clear understanding of the enemy's main situation during the War of Liberation, always grasping the initiative of the war. Chairman Mao evaluated this period as "our intelligence work was the most successful."

In 1948, according to the Central Committee's decision to have the Central Intelligence Department take charge of the work of persuading the enemy to surrender, Kenong participated in the work of persuading the peaceful liberation of Beiping, Hunan, Sichuan-Kang, Yunnan, and Tibet, and successfully organized several naval and air force mutinies of the Kuomintang and the "Two Airlines" mutiny, strongly assisting the liberation of the entire country, and receiving praise from the Central Committee.

Kenong was long in charge of the Party's security work, regarding the safety of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao as his top priority. In March 1947, when Hu Zongnan invaded Yan'an, the situation was very severe. Ye Jianying and I urged him several times to leave quickly, but Kenong said, "Chairman Mao does not leave, and as the director of the Social Affairs Department, I cannot leave." After withdrawing from Yan'an, the Central Committee decided to stay in Shaanbei. Kenong, to ensure the safety of Chairman Mao and the Central Front Committee, selected a cavalry company and three infantry companies from the original Central Guard Regiment to form an elite guard unit, following the Front Committee's actions. At the same time, he dispatched three reconnaissance stations to Suide, Longdong, and Sanbian, equipped with radios, directly serving to safeguard the Central Front Committee. Later, I and Kenong worked together in the Central Rear Committee. We were very concerned about the dangerous situation of Chairman Mao and the Central Front Committee's transfer battles in Shaanbei. In response to Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to Hu Zongnan to "capture the Communist Party leaders at any cost," we obtained a large amount of military action intelligence about Hu Zongnan's attack on Shaanbei, thus safeguarding the safety of Chairman Mao and the Central Front Committee.

After our Party reached an agreement with General Fu Zuoyi for the peaceful liberation of Beiping, Kenong took on the task of paving the way for the Party Central Committee to enter the city. At that time, the social situation in Beiping was very complex. To ensure the safety of Chairman Mao and the central leaders, he personally arranged the security and activities of Chairman Mao and the central leaders. He worked with the responsible comrades of Beiping to lead the guard troops and public security departments to restore social order, establish a revolutionary order, and safeguard the capital's safety, doing a lot of arduous work.

After the liberation of the country, Li Kenong successively served as the secretary of the Central Intelligence Commission of the Communist Party of China, the director of the Military Commission Intelligence Department, the vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the Central Military Commission General Intelligence Department, the vice chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army, and the director of the Central Investigation Department of the Communist Party of China. He was also elected as the representative of the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the representative of the first and second sessions of the National People's Congress, and the standing committee member of the third session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of General of the People's Liberation Army and was elected as a member of the Central Committee at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Kenong insisted on implementing the line, principles, and policies of our Party's intelligence work. He placed intelligence work completely under the absolute leadership of the Party and the state, emphasizing that intelligence work must serve the Party's political line, policies, and discipline; must be guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with politics as the foundation; must combine intelligence professional departments and relevant departments, and combine openness with secrecy; he required intelligence workers to be loyal to the Party and the people, to be professional and knowledgeable; he opposed the special nature of intelligence work. He formed a set of intelligence work with Chinese characteristics. He often used the fact that there is no peaceful period in intelligence work to educate cadres, maintaining constant vigilance. After the liberation of the country, he quickly realized the strategic transfer of intelligence work.

In July 1951, the Party Central Committee sent Li Kenong to North Korea to take charge of the ceasefire negotiations. He resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's foreign policy, insisted on internationalism, and fought resolutely with the Korean comrades against international imperialism. He united friends and struck at the enemy. In the negotiations, Kenong was both firm and calm, brave and wise, and combined principles with flexibility. However, due to the heavy workload and long duration, his heart disease and asthma repeatedly occurred. The Central Committee, considering his health, sent Wu Xiuquan to replace his work. But Kenong, considering the work, felt that changing personnel at the critical moment of the struggle would be unfavorable to the work. Thus, he proposed the suggestion of "not changing the general at the critical moment," which was later approved by the Central Committee. Kenong, in the ceasefire negotiations, creatively handled various problems in the negotiations, receiving praise from the Party Central Committee and the Korean comrades.

In 1954, Kenong, as a representative of the Chinese delegation, participated in the first Geneva Conference. He assisted Zhou Enlai in doing a lot of work for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue.

After the founding of the country, the activities of Party and state leaders visiting abroad increased, and the struggle against domestic and foreign hostile forces was very sharp. We together grasped the situation, studied countermeasures, and ensured the safety of Premier Zhou and other leaders' visits abroad.

Kenong paid great attention to the great cause of national reunification. In May 1955, based on the information he investigated and understood, he actively proposed to the Central Committee to strive for Li Zongren's return to the country. After several twists and turns and struggles, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, Li Zongren finally returned to the motherland.

Kenong, due to long-term heavy and complex work, was overworked and his health was always poor. But he, with the spirit of revolutionary optimism and strong revolutionary will, endured the torment of illness and worked and studied tenaciously. In 1957, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. In 1961, his condition improved slightly, and he wrote a letter to Xiaoping and me, "requesting to collect the fighting history of the Central Special Service as much as possible, compile it into a book, and also to make the unnamed heroes of the past in the struggle have a place to rest, the elderly to have a place to live, the young to have a place to depend on, and the widows, orphans, and the lonely to have a place to belong." His opinion was approved by the Central Committee. Kenong was very excited that he could continue to work for the Party. Kenong was like this, working diligently and tirelessly for the Party. He often joked, "We are donkeys, accustomed to carrying things, and if we don't carry, we are not comfortable. We carry as much as we can." Until a few days before his death in February 1962, despite suffering from angina pectoris several times, he still participated in the work meeting convened by the Central Committee and fought tenaciously to his last breath.

Kenong's life was a revolutionary life, a fighting life. He devoted all his energy to the creation and development of the Party's intelligence and security cause. His firm revolutionary faith, noble revolutionary character, flexible struggle art, hard work, and realistic work style, strict self-discipline, courage to criticize himself, and the leadership method of strict requirements and unity and care for cadres are forever worth learning.

Kenong's life left us with a lot of spiritual wealth. Although the wise and virtuous have passed away, their spirit remains. We should learn and inherit Kenong's lofty thoughts and excellent virtues, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and strive for the revitalization of China and the realization of the Four Modernizations. This is the best way to remember Kenong.

    丹心留人间　勋业传后世
　　——纪念李克农同志诞辰九十周年
　　杨尚昆
    我和李克农同志历史上工作联系密切，生前交谊深，可算挚友至交。克农同志逝世后，我一直想写点东西以为纪念。今年9月15日，恰值克农九十诞辰，这不由又勾起了我对这位久经考验的无产阶级革命家，杰出的社会活动家、外交家，忠诚的共产主义战士，我党我军情报和保卫工作的卓越组织者和领导者的缕缕追思。
    克农同志离开我们已经27年了，但我对他的音容笑貌和革命业绩却时所萦怀，历久弥深。克农同志生前曾说：“我一生不外乎做了两件事，一是保卫党中央的‘警卫员’，二是统一战线的‘尖兵’。”这虽为他自谦之言，但也反映了他光彩照人的一生。在长期的革命生涯中，他始终不渝地忠于党的事业。他的革命胆略和渊博学识，他的组织领导能力和社会交往经验，使他常受命于危难于际，但他总是以对党的无限忠诚和高度负责精神，创造性地完成任务。无论是在白色恐怖下的敌营里，还是在南征北战的峥嵘岁月，无论是在唇枪舌剑的谈判桌上，还是在隐蔽斗争的特殊战场，他始终勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨，无私无畏地忘我斗争。尤其是在情报和保卫工作上，他充分发挥了自己的独特才能，在紧急关头保卫了党中央的安全，在关键时刻向党中央提供了决策情报，为中国革命建立了伟大勋绩。
                              （一）
    李克农同志是安徽巢县人，生于1899年9月15日。青年时代就受到民主革命思想的熏陶。五四时期，投入轰轰烈烈的新文化运动。1925年“五卅”运动以后，他和阿英、王少春等同志一起在芜湖创办了民生中学，团结进步人士，积极传播革命思想，开展反帝反封建活动。1926年，他在芜湖加入中国共产党。1927年，蒋介石发动了“四一二”反革命政变，他以大无畏的革命气概，在白色恐怖下坚持进行斗争。
    1928年春，李克农同志根据党的指示，秘密转移到上海，首先同潘汉年等同志一起从事革命文化活动，并担任党的沪中区委宣传委员。1929年，正当蒋介石加紧对我党的破坏和对红军的围剿，妄图将革命力量全部消灭之时，党派克农同志同钱壮飞、胡底同志一起，打进徐恩曾把持的国民党特务首脑机关中央组织部调查科和上海无线电管理局，利用徐恩曾扩充特务组织的机会，深入敌人的要害部位，担任机要职务。他们在敌人内部成立特别党小组，由李克农同志任组长。他们为保卫党中央机关的安全，抗击敌人的暗害，向党的地下组织报警，营救被捕同志，与叛徒作斗争，开展对敌情报工作，进行了艰苦英勇的斗争，为党做出了重要贡献。
    1931年4月，中央特科的负责人顾顺章在武汉被捕叛变。设在上海的党中央机关和中央领导人的地址顾都知道，敌人企图利用顾顺章将我党中央一网打尽。在这千钧一发的危急关头，克农同志得到钱壮飞派人由南京连夜送来的这一紧急情报，他沉着机警，千方百计地设法找到陈赓同志报告了党中央。当时党中央负责人周恩来同志立即同陈云同志商定对策，在聂荣臻、陈赓、李克农、李强等同志的协助下，机智果断地与敌人展开了一场争时间的惊心搏斗，采取了一系列紧急措施，使党中央机关全部得以安全转移，彻底粉碎了敌人破坏我党中央的罪恶阴谋。同时，克农同志以自我牺牲的精神，不顾敌人的追捕，也不及考虑自己妻儿的安全，亲自安排了战友钱壮飞及其家属和胡底同志的安全转移。他和他的战友们，为保卫党中央和地下党组织的安全，作出了卓越的贡献，得到党中央的嘉奖。毛主席曾说：李克农、钱壮飞等同志是立了大功的，如果不是他们，当时许多中央同志包括周恩来这些同志，都不存在了。
                                （二）
    1931年秋，克农同志奉命离开上海到江西革命根据地工作。先后担任了国家政治保卫局执行部长、红军第一方面军政治保卫局局长、红军工作部部长等职，建立起了党的保卫侦察工作。对配合苏区工农红军粉碎敌人的“围剿”，发展和巩固苏维埃政权，都做出了成绩。
      1934年10月，克农同志参加了二万五千里长征，在长征中率领侦察部队沿途进行地面侦察工作，并担任中央纵队驻地的卫戍司令，对保卫党中央和毛主席在长征中的安全，起了重要的作用。他还协助叶剑英同志，同张国焘分裂党中央的阴谋活动进行了坚决的斗争。
    1935年，红军到达陕北后，根据形势我党决定实行抗日民族统一战线的政策，提出“停止内战，一致抗日”的主张，得到全国人民的拥护。当时，克农同志被任命为中共中央联络局局长，在毛主席决策和周恩来同志亲自主持下，克农同志受命作为我党代表，两次深入东北军开展工作，在洛川同张学良将军举行了初步秘密会谈。向东北军官兵介绍我党团结抗日的政策和主张，揭露蒋介石对外投降对内消灭异己的阴谋，并用无数事实来说明东北军只有与我党联合抗日才有出路的道理，给予东北军官兵深刻影响。与东北军达成五项局部性的口头协定，并建立了电台联系。毛主席称赞说：“李克农单枪匹马，搞得很好。”以后他又陪同周恩来同志在延安同张学良谈判，取得成功。“西安事变”发生后，克农同志任中共代表团秘书长，随周恩来同志为和平解决西安事变，挽救民族危亡，争取抗日民族统一战线的形成，建立西安红军联络处，做了大量艰苦的工作。
    1937年“七七”事变前，克农同志离开西安到上海，任中共驻上海办事处主任，进行国共合作方面的工作。“八·一三”淞沪抗战后，调南京设立八路军办事处，任办事处处长，协助周恩来和叶剑英同志，完成了许多紧急而繁重的任务。帮助恢复建立地方党组织。从国民党监狱营救保释了几百名共产党员和进步人士，并将他们转送延安，或派到国民党区工作。从上海和南京抢运数百吨物资到西安。南京失陷前夕即去武汉筹建八路军办事处，并担任中共中央长江局秘书长和八路军总部秘书长，进行了大量艰苦细致的工作，使我党的政治影响日益扩大，抗日民族统一战线广泛开展。武汉失陷前，在异常困难的情况下，克农同志指挥率领办事处和《新华日报》的大批人员撤退和做好疏散工作。1938年冬，武汉、广州相继沦陷，国民党政府迁移重庆，桂林成为同华南、华东、西南乃至香港、海外联系的重要通道。克农同志奉周恩来同志指示去桂林建立八路军办事处，使我党在西南一带有了公开的代表机构和领导核心。在此期间克农同志积极开展对国民党桂系的统战工作，团结各方人士，使桂林出现了一个较好的合作抗日的政治局面。他还通过夏衍等同志和文化艺术界人士接触，进行抗日宣传工作，推动进步文化工作的开展。当时桂林的政治情况十分复杂，特别是在国民党掀起第二次反共高潮后，面对险恶的斗争形势，克农同志不畏艰险，镇静自若，敢于斗争，善于斗争。他一面积极进行上层统战工作，揭穿敌人的阴谋诡计，以争取社会各界对我党的同情和支援；一面迅速组织人员疏散和精心部署地下工作，准备在办事处被取消后仍可取得抗日救亡的立足点。
                                  （三）
    1941年1月“皖南事变”后，李克农同志奉命撤回延安，担任党的情报和保卫工作的领导职务，先后任中共中央社会部副部长、部长，中共中央情报部副部长、部长等职。
    1941年7、8月间，党中央先后发布了《关于增强党性的决定》和《关于调查研究的决定》。这是党的情报工作历史发展上的转折点，是从搜集警报性和保卫性的情报工作转向搜集军政战略性情报工作的标志。克农同志认真学习并坚决贯彻执行中央的决定，用毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”、“主观主义是党性不纯的表现”的教导来教育干部，强调情报工作就是搞调查研究，是一种高度科学的斗争艺术。动员全体同志认真进行对敌、友、我、外情况的调查研究，树立起调查研究和情报工作的正确观点，掀起了一个热烈的了解情况，注重实际的风气，把情报工作提高到理论上思想上政治上的原则高度。
    在抗日战争时期，克农同志参与了对各地秘密情报组织的建设，派遣我情工人员深入到日、伪、蒋的党、政、军、特机构中，获取了日伪的大量军政战略情报和国民党消极抗日积极反共的情报，对配合抗日战争的胜利，起了重要作用。
    克农同志具有无产阶级革命家的远见卓识。在抗日战争即将结束时，他就考虑到内战的危险存在，指示在敌区工作的同志不要被胜利冲昏头脑，要作长期打算，要充分利用国民党接收敌占城市等有利时机，积极向国民党的各个地区发展。并指示各地情报组织要以军事情报为主，同时要做好国民党各派系的上层联络工作。
    1946年1月，国民党被迫同我党签订了“停战协定”，在北平成立了“军事调处执行部”，克农同志任中共代表团秘书长，协助叶剑英同志，同国民党反动派勾结美帝国主义发动内战的阴谋活动进行了针锋相对的斗争。同时，针对内战在即的严重形势，对华北、东北、华东等地的地下情报组织布置了工作。
    解放战争中，在党中央的领导下，由克农同志具体负责实施，使我党我军的情报工作得到更加广泛深入的发展。为配合解放战争在全国的胜利，我情工人员深入到国民党的机密决策指挥机关内，及时准确地供给了党中央和军委及各地区战略性和动向性的重要军政情报，为党中央和毛主席研究战局，制定解放战争的战略方针，提供了重要依据。使我军在解放战争中对敌人的主要情况了如指掌，始终掌握了战争的主动权。毛主席评价这个时期“我们的情报工作是最成功的。”
    1948年，根据中央决定由中情部主管策反工作的指示，克农同志参与策动了和平解放北平、湖南、川康、云南、西藏等地的工作，并成功地组织了国民党多起海空军起义和“两航”起义，有力地配合了全国的解放，得到了中央的赞扬。
    克农同志长期负责党的保卫工作，他把保卫党中央和毛主席的安全作为首要任务。1947年3月，胡宗南进犯延安，当时形势非常严峻，我和叶剑英同志几次催他赶快撤离，克农同志说：“毛主席不走，我作为社会部长不能走。撤出延安后，中央决定留在陕北，克农同志为确保毛主席和中央前委的安全，从原中央警备团中抽调了一个骑兵连和三个步兵连组成精干的警卫部队，随前委行动。同时，对绥德、陇东、三边派出了三个侦察站，配备了电台，直接为保卫中央前委服务。此后，我和克农同志一起在中央后委工作，我们对毛主席和中央前委转战陕北的艰险处境非常担心，针对蒋介石密令胡宗南“不惜一切代价捕获中共首脑部”的阴谋，侦悉了胡宗南进攻陕北的大量军事行动情报，从而保卫了毛主席和中央前委的安全。
    我党与傅作义将军达成和平解放北平协议后，克农同志又担负起为党中央进城打前站的任务。当时北平社会情况十分复杂，为确保毛主席和中央领导同志的安全，他亲自布置警卫，安排毛主席和中央领导同志的活动。他会同北平市负责同志，领导警卫部队和公安部门，为整顿社会治安，建立革命秩序，为保卫首都安全，做了大量艰巨的工作。

    全国解放后，李克农同志历任中共中央情报委员会书记，中央军委情报部部长，外交部副部长，中央军委总情报部部长，中国人民解放军副总参谋长，中共中央调查部部长等职。并当选为第一届政协中共代表团代表，第一、第二届全国人民代表大会代表，中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员。1955年被授予中国人民解放军上将军衔，在党的第八次全国代表大会上被选为中央委员。
    李克农同志坚持贯彻我党情报工作的路线、方针和政策。他把情报工作完全置于党和国家的绝对领导之下，强调情报工作必须服从党的政治路线，服从党的政策和纪律；必须以马列主义、毛泽东思想为指导，以政治为基础；情报专业部门和有关部门相结合，公开与秘密相结合；他要求情报工作人员必须忠于党，忠于人民，必须专业化，知识化；反对把情报工作特殊化。形成了一套具有中国特色的情报工作。他经常以情报工作没有和平时期来教育干部，保持常备不懈。全国解放后，很快实现了情报工作的战略转移。
    1951年7月，党中央派李克农同志赴朝鲜负责停战谈判工作。他坚决执行党中央的外交政策，坚持国际主义原则，和朝鲜同志一道同国际帝国主义进行了坚决的斗争。团结了朋友，打击了敌人。在谈判过程中，克农同志既坚定沉着，有胆有识，又实事求是，把原则性和灵活性高度结合起来。但由于工作量大，持续时间长，他的心脏病和哮喘病一次次地发作。中央为照顾他的身体，派伍修权同志去替换他的工作。但克农同志从工作考虑，感到在斗争的关键时刻换人，一切又得从头做起，这样对工作不利。于是他提出“临阵不换将”的建议，后来中央同意了他的意见。克农同志在停战谈判过程中，富有创造性地处理谈判中的各种问题，受到党中央和朝鲜同志的赞扬。
    1954年克农同志作为中国代表团代表，参加了第一次日内瓦会议。为和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，协助周恩来同志做了许多工作。
    建国后，党和国家领导人出国访问活动增多，面对国内外敌对势力的破坏，斗争非常尖锐。我们一起掌握情况，研究对策，保证了周总理和其他领导同志出国访问的安全。
    克农同志非常关心祖国的统一大业。1955年5月，他根据调查了解的情况，积极向中央建议，要争取李宗仁回国，后几经周折和斗争，在毛主席和周总理领导下，终于使李宗仁回到祖国。
    克农同志由于长期担负繁重和复杂的工作，使他积劳成疾，身体一向不好。但他以革命乐观主义精神和坚强的革命毅力，克制着病痛的折磨，顽强地坚持工作和学习。1957年他患了脑溢血。1961年他的病情略有好转，即写信给小平同志和我，“要求将中央特科的斗争历史，尽可能加以搜集，汇编成册，同时也可使过去在斗争中的无名英雄死有所安，老有所归，幼有所寄，鳏寡孤独，各得其所。”他的意见得到中央的批准。克农同志对自己能继续为党工作，感到非常兴奋。克农同志就是这样勤勤恳恳，不知疲倦地为党工作着。他常诙谐地说：“我们是毛驴子，驮惯了东西，不驮是不舒服的，能驮多少，就驮多少。”直到1962年2月他逝世的前几天，尽管已患了几次心绞痛，但他仍参加了中央召开的工作会议，一直顽强地战斗到最后的一息。
    克农同志的一生是革命的一生，战斗的一生。他为创建与发展党的情报保卫事业，献出了毕业的精力。他那坚定的革命信念，高尚的革命情操，灵活的斗争艺术，艰苦奋斗和实事求是的工作作风，严于律己，勇于自我批评的精神，对干部既严格要求又团结爱护的领导方法，永远值得我们学习。
    克农同志的一生留给我们的精神财富很多。英贤虽逝，精神犹在。我们要学习继承克农同志的崇高思想和优秀品德，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，反对资产阶级自由化，为振兴中华，实现四个现代化而努力奋斗，这才是我们对克农同志的最好纪念。
