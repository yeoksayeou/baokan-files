People's Daily, Cairo, September 18th. Correspondent Lin Jiaoming reports: Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin suddenly flew to Cairo, the capital of Egypt, this morning to discuss preparations for direct talks between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian delegation in Egypt, as well as Egypt's proposed 10-point plan for elections in the occupied territories. Rabin's meeting with President Hosni Mubarak lasted nearly three hours. The two sides are moving closer on the issue of holding direct talks between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations.

After the meeting, Rabin and Mubarak held separate press conferences to discuss the key points of the talks.

Rabin said that Israel supports Egypt's proposal for direct talks between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian delegation; agrees to have Egypt invite and convene the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; and that the list of members of the Palestinian delegation and the time of the talks will be announced by the Egyptian side. Rabin hopes that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians will become a new starting point for the Middle East peace process.

President Mubarak said, "The talks were fruitful." Direct talks between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations are key to breaking the current stalemate in the Middle East. Elections in the occupied territories can only be held after direct talks. Egypt is negotiating with Israel on one hand and maintaining contact with the PLO on the other, hoping to facilitate direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.

He said that Egypt and Israel have come closer on some views, but there are still many issues that need further clarification. He advocated that the Palestinian delegation should include representatives from outside the occupied territories. He said that the PLO is sincerely willing to negotiate with Israel and has made many concessions. Mubarak stated that he will further discuss with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Finance Minister Shimon Peres in New York.

According to Egyptian diplomatic sources, Egypt and Israel still have differences on the principles of the composition of the Palestinian delegation.

Rabin's visit to Egypt was approved by the Israeli cabinet. However, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir stated that Rabin "did not carry any commitments from the government."

    穆巴拉克与拉宾会谈
　　讨论以巴谈判与埃及和平计划问题
    本报开罗9月18日电　记者林皎明报道：以色列国防部长拉宾今天上午突然飞抵埃及首都开罗，与穆巴拉克总统就筹备以色列代表团与巴勒斯坦代表团在埃及举行直接谈判和有关埃及提出的被占领土选举10点计划等问题交换意见。拉宾与穆巴拉克总统的会谈持续近3小时。双方在举行以巴代表团直接会谈问题上趋向接近。
    会谈后，拉宾与穆巴拉克先后单独举行记者招待会，就会谈焦点问题发表谈话。
    拉宾说，以色列赞同埃及主张以色列代表团与巴勒斯坦代表团举行直接谈判的设想；同意由埃及出面邀请和召集以巴谈判；巴勒斯坦代表团的组成人员名单和举行时间也由埃及方面宣布。拉宾希望以巴直接谈判成为中东和平进程的新起点。
    穆巴拉克总统说，“会谈是有成果的”。巴以代表团举行直接谈判是打破中东目前僵局的关键，被占领土选举只能在直接谈判之后。埃及一方面与以色列谈判，一方面与巴解组织联系，希望促成巴以直接谈判。
    他说，埃以双方在一些观点上接近，但在许多问题上需要进一步澄清。他主张巴勒斯坦代表团应该包括被占领土以外的代表。他说，巴解组织真诚愿意同以色列谈判，已经做出许多让步。穆巴拉克表示，他将在纽约与以外长阿伦斯及财长佩雷斯进一步会谈。
    据埃及外交人士透露，埃及与以色列在巴勒斯坦代表团人员组成的原则上仍存在分歧。
    拉宾埃及之行是得到以色列内阁批准的。但以色列总理沙米尔表示，拉宾“没有身负政府的任何承诺”。
