　　我国宗教信仰自由政策不变
    新华社北京9月13日电　（记者周树春）国家副主席王震今天在会见伊朗伊斯兰代表团时说，中国实行的宗教信仰自由政策是一项长期政策，不会改变。
    王震在人民大会堂会见以伊朗伊斯兰宣传组织主席、宪法监护委员会成员、专家会议成员阿亚图拉贾纳提为团长的伊朗伊斯兰代表团时说，中国各宗教之间是互相平等的，政府对各宗教一视同仁，“因为我国实行的宗教政策是宗教信仰自由政策；这是一项长期的政策”。王震还说，中国各宗教坚持独立、自主、自办的原则，“我们不干涉别国的宗教事务，也不允许别国干涉中国的宗教事务；我们在独立自主、平等友好、互相尊重的基础上积极发展同世界各国宗教界的友好往来。”会见时，王震表示相信阿亚图拉贾纳提一行的访问将增进中伊两国的友好关系和两国宗教界的交流。
    阿亚图拉贾纳提说，访问中他看到，在中国，“宗教信仰的确是自由的。”
