*Zhongshan* Presents "New Realism Novel Grand Exhibition"

The recent two issues of *Zhongshan* have prominently featured a series of "new realism novels." These novels, standing at the height of the times, confront life directly, embrace reality, and are rich with the breath of life, beginning to attract the attention of readers and critics.

The so-called new realism novels, in terms of their overall literary spirit, still belong to the broad category of realism. They are a development and deepening of realism and represent a current distinct from modernist "avant-garde literature." The emergence of "new realism" is the result of a group of realistic writers adjusting their aesthetic consciousness. Works such as Gao Xiaosheng's "Touching Bad Luck," Zhao Benfu's "Walking Out of Blue Water River," Zhu Sujin's "Born in Despair," and Fan Xiaqing's "Heir to the Gu Family" published in this journal all have new charm and new structures. These novels, with a plain and straightforward narrative attitude, calmly and objectively reproduce the original form of life, and artistically integrate some techniques beyond realism.

According to the editors, they are launching the "Grand Exhibition" to advocate for more writers to engage in "new realism" and to promote the development of realistic creation.

    《钟山》推出“新写实小说大联展”
    最近两期的《钟山》以突出的篇幅刊登了一批“新写实小说”，这些小说站在时代的高度直面人生，拥抱现实，富有浓郁的生活气息，开始引起了读者和评论界的注意。
    所谓新写实小说，从总的文学精神来看仍属于现实主义的大范畴，是现实主义的发展和深化，是与现代主义“先锋派文学”相异的一股潮流。“新写实”的出现，是一批写实型作家审美意识调整的产物。发表在该刊上的高晓声的《触霉》、赵本夫的《走出蓝水河》、朱苏进的《在绝望中诞生》、范小青的《顾氏传人》等都有了新的风彩新的格局，这些小说以一种平实质朴的叙述态度冷静客观地再现生活的原生形态，在艺术上也融会了一些现实主义之外的手法。
    据编者介绍，他们推出“大联展”，旨在倡导更多的作家投入“新写实”，并期望推动现实主义创作的发展。
