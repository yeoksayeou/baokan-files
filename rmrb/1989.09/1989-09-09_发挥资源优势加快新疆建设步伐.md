Xinjiang is located in the western border region of the motherland and is a region where ethnic minorities reside. It has a vast territory and abundant resources. Since its liberation, 40 years of construction have brought about tremendous changes. In particular, the 10-year reform has brought Xinjiang into its best period of historical development.

The main indicators of this transformation are as follows: First, by emphasizing and strengthening the foundational role of agriculture and animal husbandry, adhering to rural and pastoral area reforms, and focusing on agricultural water conservancy infrastructure and rural "five-good" construction, agriculture and animal husbandry have seen 11 consecutive years of bumper harvests. Per capita grain production ranks seventh in the nation, per capita cotton production is first in the nation, and per capita livestock production is 2.8 times the national average. Grain production is self-sufficient, and the living standards of all ethnic groups continue to improve. Second, the petroleum and petrochemical industries have seen significant development. In recent years, while the production capacity of the Kela-Mayi Oilfield has been continuously expanded, geological exploration in the northern and southern regions has also seen substantial progress. In particular, a series of major breakthroughs in the Tarim Basin have made the large-scale development of petroleum in Xinjiang inevitable, which will undoubtedly drive the development of related industries and the overall national economy. Third, geological exploration and scientific research during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" have confirmed that the geological structure belt between the Soviet Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, rich in non-ferrous metals, and Gansu Province in China has abundant copper, nickel, lead, zinc, and gold. The non-ferrous metal industry shows a broad prospect. Fourth, the 19 billion tons of salt reserves along the railway have been rapidly developed due to the increasing demand in the inland market and have become an important industry in the region. Fifth, the light textile and food industries, which use agricultural and pastoral products as raw materials, have taken shape after years of construction and renovation. Sixth, the coal and power industries have developed rapidly, basically meeting the needs of economic development. Civil aviation, railways, highways, and communication infrastructure have also seen significant improvements. The northern Xinjiang railway, which connects the Eurasian continent, is being extended westward and is expected to connect with the Soviet railway by next year. At the same time, in recent years, we have gradually expanded the scope of trade and economic cooperation with countries around the world, making Xinjiang a gateway for China's opening to the west. Although Xinjiang is located in a remote area, due to the country's adjustment of the industrial structure and the formulation of policies to focus on the development of agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw materials, this is very beneficial to us and provides opportunities for the economic development of the region. Although Xinjiang's current economic foundation is still relatively weak and there are still many difficulties, the favorable conditions are dominant. Therefore, we are full of confidence in the future of Xinjiang.

In accordance with the tasks proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, combined with the actual situation in our region, our main goals for the development and construction of Xinjiang in the future are to consolidate the foundation of agriculture and animal husbandry, strengthen water, electricity, and transportation infrastructure, and build four bases: petroleum and petrochemical, non-ferrous metals, salt and salt chemicals, and light textiles and food. This will create conditions for the large-scale development and construction of Xinjiang.

To achieve this goal, we deeply understand that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and the ideological and political basis for uniting the people of all ethnic groups. We must strive to uphold them consistently. Reform and opening up are the inevitable path to prosperity and strength, and they are also the inevitable path to the development and construction of Xinjiang and the common prosperity and progress of all ethnic groups. We must firmly adhere to them. At the same time, Xinjiang is a region with a large ethnic minority population, and we must also adhere to the principle of ethnic unity. This is the premise and guarantee for consolidating and developing the political situation of stability and unity in Xinjiang and for doing all work well.

In the process of developing and constructing Xinjiang, we must firmly grasp the characteristic of Xinjiang, which is rich in resources but has a relatively low level of productivity. We must adhere to the actual situation of Xinjiang, leverage our strengths and avoid our weaknesses, formulate policies and measures that suit the actual situation of Xinjiang, concentrate limited manpower, material resources, and financial resources, mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, focus on key areas, and coordinate overall planning.

The development and construction of Xinjiang is closely linked to the development and utilization of resources. In a sense, the day Xinjiang's resources are fully developed is the day Xinjiang's economy takes off. The development of Xinjiang's resources relies on the strength of the country, but more importantly, it relies on the strength of the local area. In the future, in the process of resource development, we will adhere to the principle of relying on the main forces of the industry, relying on the local social foundation, coordinating planning, and joint development. Adhering to this principle will make the industry and the local area closely connected, which is beneficial to the country, beneficial to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and also beneficial to the development of the local national economy. In recent years, through the construction of railways and civil aviation, the development and utilization of oil and gas resources, and the mining of non-ferrous metals, we have accumulated some experience in this regard. Continuously adhering to and improving this principle will definitely bring unlimited vitality to the economic development of Xinjiang.

Xinjiang's fiscal situation is still difficult, and construction funds are limited. In the future, we will continue to carry forward the tradition of hard work and strive to tighten our belts. In addition to ensuring necessary expenditures, we will actively establish various economic development funds to concentrate more funds for construction and accelerate the speed of development and construction.

Xinjiang is the gateway for China's opening to the west. In the process of opening up to the outside world, we will continue to implement the principles of "all-round opening, leaning to the west" and "internal and external connections, east-west cooperation." Expanding foreign markets not only relies on Xinjiang's own strength but also relies on the strength of other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country. Therefore, we must be determined to strengthen east-west cooperation, strengthen economic and technological cooperation with brother provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and strive to build Xinjiang into a trade and economic center for China's opening to the west.

We believe that as long as we firmly adhere to the principle of "one center, two basic points," continuously strengthen ethnic unity, and strive to start from the actual situation of our region, leverage our unique advantages, and work practically, we will definitely be able to accelerate the development and construction of Xinjiang and continuously create a prosperous and flourishing future for Xinjiang.

    发挥资源优势加快新疆建设步伐
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记　宋汉良
    新疆维吾尔自治区主席　铁木尔·达瓦买提
    新疆地处祖国西部边疆，是少数民族聚居区，地域辽阔，资源丰富。解放后经过40年的建设，各方面发生了翻天覆地的变化。特别是10年改革，使新疆进入了历史发展的最好时期。
    巨变的主要标志：一是由于重视和加强农牧业的基础地位，坚持农村牧区改革，坚持大搞农田水利基本建设和农村“五好”建设，农牧业已连续11年丰收，人均占有粮食跃居全国第七，人均占有棉花居全国第一，人均占有牲畜为全国平均数的2.8倍，粮食自给有余，各族人民生活不断改善；二是石油和石油化工工业有了较大发展，近几年在克拉玛依油田生产能力不断扩大的同时，南北疆石油地质勘探都有很大发展，特别是在塔里木盆地的一系列重大突破，使新疆的石油大开发势在必行，它必将带动我区相关产业以及整个国民经济的发展；三是经过“七五”期间的地质勘探和科研攻关，已证实我区位于盛产有色金属的苏联哈萨克加盟共和国和我国甘肃省之间的地质构造带，具有丰富的铜、镍、铅、锌和黄金，有色金属工业展现出广阔的前景；四是分布在铁路沿线的已探明储量19亿吨的湖盐，随着内地市场需求量的增加正在加快开发，已成为我区一个重要的产业；五是以农牧产品为原料的轻纺食品工业，经过多年的建设和更新改造已经初具规模；六是煤炭、电力等能源工业发展很快，基本上能保证经济发展的需要，民航、铁路、公路、通讯等基础设施也有较大改善，沟通欧亚大陆的北疆铁路正在顺利向西延伸，预计到明年可与苏联铁路接轨。同时，这几年逐步拓宽了我区同世界各国发展贸易和经济合作的领域，使我区成为我国向西开放的门户。新疆虽然地处边远，但由于国家调整了产业结构，制定了重点发展农业、能源、交通和原材料的产业政策，这对我们十分有利，为我区经济发展提供了机遇。尽管新疆目前的经济基础还较薄弱，困难还比较多，但比较起来有利条件还是占主导地位，因此，我们对新疆的前途充满了信心。
    根据党的十三大提出的任务和四中全会精神，结合我区的实际，今后，我们新疆开发建设的主要目标是，巩固农牧业这个基础，强化水电路基础设施，建设石油和石油化工、有色金属工业、盐和盐化工、轻纺食品工业四个基地，为新疆的大规模开发建设创造条件。
    为了实现这个目标，我们深刻地认识到，四项基本原则是立国之本，也是我们团结各族人民的思想政治基础，必须努力坚持，一以贯之；改革开放是富国强民的必由之路，也是开发建设新疆、实现各民族共同繁荣进步的必由之路，必须坚定不移地坚持。同时，新疆是个少数民族地区，还必须坚持搞好民族团结，这是巩固和发展新疆安定团结的政治局面、做好一切工作的前提和保证。
    在新疆的开发建设过程中，我们要牢牢把握住新疆资源丰富而生产力水平较低这个特点，坚持从新疆的实际出发，扬长避短，制定符合新疆实际的方针政策，集中有限的人力、物力和财力，调动各方面的积极性，突出重点，统筹兼顾。
    新疆的开发建设是和资源的开发利用紧密联系在一起的，从某种意义上说，新疆资源的大开发之日，就是新疆经济腾飞之时。开发新疆的资源，需要依靠国家的力量，更要依靠地方的力量。今后在资源的开发过程中，我们将实行依靠行业主力，依托当地社会基础，统筹规划，共同发展的方针。坚持这个方针，使行业和地方紧密联系，有利于国家，有利于调动各方面的积极性，也有利于地方民族经济的发展。这几年，我们通过铁路、民航建设、油气资源的开发利用和有色金属的开采，已经在这方面摸索和积累了一定的经验。不断坚持和完善这个方针，必定会给新疆的经济发展带来无限的生机。
    新疆的财政还比较困难，建设资金有限。今后，我们将继续发扬艰苦奋斗的传统，坚持过紧日子。在保证必不可少的支出外，要积极建立各项经济发展基金，以集中更多的资金用于建设，加快开发建设的速度。
    新疆是我国向西开放的门户，在对外开放中要继续贯彻
  “全方位开放、向西倾斜”和“内联外引、东联西出”的方针。开拓国外市场不仅要靠新疆自身的力量，还有赖于全国其他省、区的力量。因此，要下决心搞好东联西出，加强同兄弟省、市、自治区的经济技术合作，努力把新疆建设成为我国向西开放的贸易和经济中心。
    我们相信，只要坚定不移地坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”，不断增强民族团结，努力从我区实际出发，发挥独特优势，脚踏实地地工作，就一定能够加快新疆开发建设的步伐，不断开创新疆繁荣昌盛的美好未来。（附图片）
