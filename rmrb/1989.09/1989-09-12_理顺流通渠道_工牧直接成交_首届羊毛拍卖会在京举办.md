The first national wool auction will be held in Beijing from September 14 to September 19. This is an important measure taken jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Textile Industry to benefit production, processing, and consumers, aiming to break regional barriers and streamline the wool circulation channels.

The distinctive feature of this wool auction is the direct transaction between the pastoral sector (producers of wool) and the industrial sector (processors of wool). The specific method involves graded management, objective evaluation, preferential use of high-quality wool, and pricing based on clean wool.

Concurrently with the auction, the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture will jointly host the first national wool (and mohair) and related products exhibition. Comrade Li Peng inscribed the exhibition with the words: "Self-reliance, hard work, develop the sheep industry, and strive together to improve national self-sufficiency in wool."

　　理顺流通渠道　工牧直接成交
　　首届羊毛拍卖会在京举办
    本报北京9月12日讯　记者莫新元、蒋亚平报道：全国首届羊毛拍卖会将于9月14日至9月19日在北京进行。这是农业部和纺织工业部从有利于生产、加工和消费者利益出发，为打破地区封锁，努力理顺羊毛流通渠道联合采取的一项重要措施。
    这次羊毛拍卖会最大的特点是：由生产羊毛的牧方和加工羊毛的工方直接成交。具体办法是分级管理，客观检验，优毛优用，净毛计价。
    在举办拍卖会的同时，纺织工业部和农业部还共同主办全国首届羊毛（绒）及其制品展示会。李鹏同志为展示会题词：“自力更生，艰苦奋斗，发展养羊业，为提高国毛自给而共同努力。”
