Wan Li Meets with the Delegation of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 7th - Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Wan Li, met with the delegation of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, led by Vice Chairman Sun Seong-pil, this afternoon. Wan Li said that China firmly supports the Korean people in their just struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country.

Wan Li said, “Accelerating the economic development of the two countries is our common wish and goal. China and the DPRK support each other and learn from each other. Currently, cooperation in various fields between the two sides is proceeding well.”

He said that during the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in June this year, China received support from the Workers' Party of Korea and the Supreme People's Assembly, “For this, we express our gratitude.” Wan Li, in introducing the situation in China, said that in the previous period, there were phenomena of inflation and management chaos, and the erroneous guiding ideology of Comrade Zhao Ziyang in economic work was an important reason. China is now focusing on rectification and order.

Sun Seong-pil said that he had also visited China before, and this visit made him feel even more deeply the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

He said that the Korean people will follow the teachings of the great leader Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and pass down this friendship from generation to generation.

Sun Seong-pil, in introducing the domestic situation, said that the important tasks for the Korean people at present are to build the economy and achieve national reunification. Although there are difficulties in reunifying the country, the overall situation is favorable for the revolution, and no force can stop the tide of reunification.

After the meeting, Chairman Wan Li hosted a banquet to entertain the Korean guests.

Vice Chairman Hab Zibin participated in the meeting and the banquet.
