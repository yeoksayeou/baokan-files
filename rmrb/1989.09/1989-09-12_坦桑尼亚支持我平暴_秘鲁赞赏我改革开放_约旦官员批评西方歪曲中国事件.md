Jordanian Official Criticizes Western Distortion of Chinese Events

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, September 11th - The Jordanian newspaper "Al-Mithaq" today published an article titled "Lessons from China" written by Fayez Jabir Amin, the Secretary-General of the "Jerusalem Affairs Committee." The article criticizes Western media for distorting the reporting of the Chinese student events.

Amin said, "The Western media, which played a significant role in inciting the riots, exaggerated the events and used inappropriate terms such as 'massacre' and 'genocide.'"

"Some Western leaders claimed to be shocked by the events in China. However, they never express shock over the human rights violations and destruction of homes occurring in Palestinian and Lebanese territories."

In the concluding part of the article, Amin wrote that during his visit to China after the student riots, he felt that the Chinese people have genuine feelings for the Arab people, especially the people of Jordan. The Chinese leadership and people have great respect and admiration for King Hussein. Now, China, having solved the problems of food, employment, and housing, is moving towards industrialization and modern technology.

    新华社安曼9月11日电　约旦《宪章报》今天刊登了“耶路撒冷事务委员会”总书记法耶兹·贾比尔·阿明撰写的题为《中国的教训》的文章，批评西方新闻媒介歪曲报道中国的学生事件。
    阿明说，“在怂恿骚乱中起重大作用的西方新闻界对这事件言过其实，并运用了诸如‘大屠杀’、‘灭绝’这些不合乎情势的言辞。”
      “有些西方领导人声称发生在中国的事件使他们震惊。但是，他们对巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩领土上发生了的和正在发生的侵犯人权、毁坏住房的行径却从不感到震惊。”
    阿明在文章的最后写道，在学生闹事事件之后他对中国访问期间，他感到中国人民对阿拉伯人民、尤其是约旦人民怀有真挚的感情，中国领导人和中国人民非常尊重和敬仰侯赛因国王。现在，中国在解决了粮食、就业和住房问题后正朝着工业化和现代化技术方向前进。
