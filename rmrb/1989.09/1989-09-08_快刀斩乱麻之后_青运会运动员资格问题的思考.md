	After the Swift Strike to Untangle the Mess
	– Reflections on the Qualification Issues of Athletes in the Youth Games

	Gansu's road cycling and the People's Liberation Army's men's and women's basketball teams are long-standing domestic champions, yet their teams were not seen on the Youth Games field. Upon inquiry, it turned out that some athletes were found to have falsely reported their ages, and their qualifications to participate in the finals were revoked.

	Cheating in youth competitions has become increasingly rampant in recent years. A responsible person from the organizing committee of this Youth Games revealed that three main methods of cheating have been identified: substituting older athletes for younger ones, changing names, and switching teams. This time, the State Sports Commission has taken serious action. On one hand, it adopted a swift and decisive approach, canceling the participation qualifications of any athletes found to be cheating, and even if they temporarily slipped through, their rankings would be canceled after the competition. On the other hand, it established a national athlete database starting from their participation in amateur sports school competitions, to be used as a basis for future qualification reviews.

	Before the Youth Games finals began, 202 individuals and 10 teams were found to have issues with their ages and other aspects, and their participation qualifications were revoked. Of course, the qualification review agency does not deny that there may have been some "collateral damage." To solve the problems of cheating in youth competitions, it is necessary to establish a complete set of rules and regulations and strict review procedures on one hand. On the other hand, it also relies on sports workers in various places to improve their ideological awareness and handle the relationship between personal interests, local interests, and national interests. Guangxi athletes have scored the highest in the past two Olympic Games, and this time, the Guangxi delegation had no athletes found to be overage. Imagine, if they were only intimidated by the system without a sense of the bigger picture, it would be difficult for them to remain so clean.

    快刀斩乱麻之后
    ——青运会运动员资格问题的思考
    甘肃的公路自行车、解放军的男女篮，都是多年国内称雄的强项，可是在青运会的赛场上，却见不到他们的队伍。一问，原来是有的队员被查出虚报年龄，吊销了参加决赛的资格。
    青少年比赛弄虚作假，这几年越搞越邪乎。本届青运会组委会一位负责人透露，现已查明，作假手法大致为以大充小、更名易姓和改换门庭3种。国家体委这一次动了真格的，一方面采用快刀斩乱麻的作法，凡经查出，坚决取消参赛资格，即使暂时混过，赛后查出也将取消名次；另一方面，建立全国运动员从参加业余体校比赛开始的资料档案，作为今后资格审查的依据。
    在青运会决赛全面展开之前，已有202人和10个队在年龄等方面发现问题，被取消了参赛资格。当然，资格审查机构不否认，其中确有被“误伤”者。解决青少年竞赛中弄虚作假等问题，建立完善的规章制度和严格的审查手续是一方面，另一方面，也有赖于各地体育工作者提高思想认识水平，处理好个人利益、地方利益与国家利益的关系。广西选手近两届奥运会上得分都是全国第一，而这次广西代表团没有一名选手被查出超龄。试想，假如他们仅慑于制度而无大局观，大概难于如此清白。
