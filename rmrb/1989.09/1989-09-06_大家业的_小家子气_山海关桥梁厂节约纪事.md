Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory is an old factory with a big reputation. Its products are distributed all over the country, including major equipment and components for 7 railway and highway bridges crossing the Yangtze River and 8 bridges crossing the Yellow River. The factory has fixed assets of 140 million yuan and over 8,000 employees.

However, the employees of the large and prosperous Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory have cultivated a "small family spirit," picking up every scrap of cotton waste and every piece of rope. Just in the first half of this year, the entire factory saved and reused old materials worth 1.88 million yuan.

The workers' thrift is due to the leadership's insistence on maintaining a spirit of hard work and frugality. In the past, the factory leaders worked in a single-person dormitory. In 1978, when the factory's hospital moved into a new building, the old hospital was repaired and became the office space for the management. Some rooms were drafty in winter and leaked in summer. The leaders made important decisions for the factory and received guests from all sides in this cramped and dilapidated space. This August, a new building was completed in the factory, but they let the engineering and technical personnel move in, while the party committee's main leaders and the party committee's offices remained. The leaders have always maintained integrity and self-discipline, using this as a key to cultivating the enterprise spirit of hard work and self-reliance. The factory is about 20 kilometers from Qinhuangdao City, and the leaders often have to go there for meetings. However, the factory only has 4 old cars that have been running for decades. Sometimes there aren't enough cars, so they take the public bus.

In recent years, foreign businessmen have frequently come to the factory to discuss business. Some people think that such a large factory using old "Shanghai" cars to pick up and drop off foreign businessmen is too demeaning. They, however, believe: no matter how good the car is, "poverty" remains a reality of China.

To make the spirit of hard work and self-reliance a cohesive force for the enterprise, the factory holds "Double Hundred" activities every year (each person saves 100 yuan and collects 100 kilograms of scrap metal). The factory union organizes "Double Increase, Double Save, Competition for Merit" activities, and the Communist Youth League organizes "Double Increase, Double Save, Aspire to Standards" activities. This year, more than 2,500 young team members in the factory have all made savings plans.

On April 11th, the factory celebrated its 95th anniversary. Some employees thought that since it was the first time celebrating the factory's 95th anniversary, they would definitely give out some gifts and take two days off. The leaders did not do this, stipulating: "The theme of the factory anniversary is 'Love the Party, Love the Factory, Work Hard and Struggle.'" The factory anniversary did not take a holiday, did not invite guests, did not give gifts, and did not distribute goods. The factory's stage curtain had been used for more than ten years, and the bottom was already torn. Replacing it with a new one would cost 6,700 yuan. They weighed it from all sides and just couldn't bear to spend this money. They bought 800 yuan worth of colored cloth to make a border, cut off the torn part of the curtain, sewed on the border, and continued to use it. The entire anniversary did not spend a single extra penny.

Through various activities, the employees have been educated in hard work, loving the Party, and loving the factory, strengthening their sense of responsibility as masters of the enterprise.

The factory has won their hearts, and thrift and careful planning have become their voluntary actions.

    大家业的“小家子气”
    ——山海关桥梁厂节约纪事
    张立明
    山海关桥梁厂是个老厂，名气大，产品遍及全国各地，其中包括7座跨越长江、8座跨越黄河的铁路公路大桥的主要设备、部件；现有固定资产1.4亿元，8000多职工。
    但是，家大业大的山海关桥梁厂职工却养成了“小家子气”，一把废棉丝，一根草绳头都要捡起来，仅今年上半年，全厂节约、修旧利废达188万元。
    职工节俭，是因为有一个保持艰苦作风的领导班子。过去，厂领导们挤在单身宿舍里办公。 1978年，厂职工医院迁入新楼，旧医院修修补补成了机关办公的地方，有的房间冬天透风，夏天漏雨，厂领导们在这简陋狭窄的空间里，决策工厂大事，接待各方来客。今年8月，厂里一栋新楼竣工，他们又让工程技术人员搬了进去，党委主要领导和党委机关仍然没有搬。厂领导始终以廉洁自律，并以此做为培养艰苦奋斗企业精神的关键。工厂距秦皇岛市近20公里，厂领导经常要去开会，但是，工厂仅有4台跑了几十年的旧车。有时车不够用，就挤公共汽车。
    近几年，一些外商经常来厂洽谈业务，有人认为，堂堂大厂，用旧“上海”接送外商，太掉价了，他们却认为：车子再好，“穷”仍然是中国国情。
    为了使艰苦奋斗的精神成为企业的凝聚力量，工厂每年都要在职工中开展“双百”活动（每人节约100元钱，收捡100公斤废钢铁）。厂工会开展“双增双节，立功竞赛”，共青团开展的“双增双节，立志达标”活动。今年全厂2500多名团员青年每人都制订了节约规划。
    今年4月11日，是工厂95年厂庆，有的职工认为，95年第一次搞厂庆，肯定要发点东西，放两天假。厂领导没有这样做，规定：“厂庆的主题是
  ‘爱党、爱厂、艰苦奋斗’”，“厂庆不放假、不请客、不送礼、不发财物”。厂俱乐部大幕布用了十几年，下端已经破碎，换一个新的要6700元。他们左掂量右掂量，硬是没舍得花这笔钱，用800块钱买了点彩布做成花边，把幕布破碎部分剪下，接上花边照常用，整个厂庆没乱花一分钱。
    职工们从各种活动中，受到了艰苦奋斗、爱党、爱厂的教育，增强了主人翁责任感。
    工厂拴住了他们的心，勤俭持家、精打细算成了他们自觉行动。
