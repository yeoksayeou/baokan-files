Today evening, the Capital Gymnasium was filled with over 14,000 enthusiastic spectators, their deafening cheers and support echoing throughout the arena as the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship final unfolded. The Chinese men's basketball team and the Chinese Taipei men's basketball team fought valiantly, defeating the South Korean team and the Japanese team respectively.

The match for third place began with intense competition between Chinese Taipei and Japan. The physically imposing Japanese team scored frequently under the basket, while Chinese Taipei compensated for their height disadvantage with tenacious fighting spirit and aggressive running. The 11th player, who had not appeared in previous matches, was brought in by coach Liu Junqing to play as the second center. He performed exceptionally, repeatedly disrupting the opponent's attacks and creating scoring opportunities for his teammates. Amidst the roaring cheers of the spectators, Chinese Taipei grew stronger, gradually widening the score gap, and ultimately won with a score of 69:58. This was Chinese Taipei's first victory over Japan in the Asian Championships since 1973, and the players and coach were moved to tears of joy.

The Chinese team faced their old rivals and started the match at a disadvantage, falling behind in the score. It was not until the 8th minute that they took a 21:19 lead. From then on, the Chinese team's offense was relentless, with successful long-range shots, dunks, and fast breaks. Their defense was proactive and effective, suppressing the South Korean team's three-pointers and maintaining pressure throughout the game. In the end, the Chinese team won with a score of 102:72, securing their seventh Asian Men's Basketball Championship title. This match also marked the second time the Chinese team achieved a high-score victory against the South Korean team in their history of competition.

    中国男篮夺得亚洲冠军
    中国台北队战胜日本队获第三名
    本报北京9月24日讯　记者吴骅、陈昭报道：今天晚上首都体育馆内，第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛决赛中最累的，要数14000余名热情的观众了，在他们震耳欲聋的呐喊助威声中，中国男篮和中国台北男篮越战越勇，分别击败南朝鲜队和日本队。
    争夺第三名的比赛一开始，中国台北队和日本队就展开激烈的争夺。身材高大的日本队在篮下频频得手，中国台北队则以顽强的斗志和积极的奔跑弥补自己身高上的劣势。在前几场比赛中一直没有露面的11号，被教练刘俊卿派上场打二中锋，他发挥出色，多次破坏对方进攻，为同伴创造得分机会。在全场观众的加油声中，中国台北队越战越勇，逐渐把比分拉开，最后以69∶58战胜日本队。这是中国台北队自1973年以来，首次在亚洲锦标赛上战胜日本队，队员们和教练都激动地流下了热泪。
    中国队在与老对手的比赛中开局不利，比分落后，赛至8分钟时才以21∶19超出。此后，中国队的进攻似狂风暴雨，远投、扣篮、快攻接连奏效，防守积极主动，有效地抑制了南朝鲜队的三分球，始终压着对手打。最后中国队以102∶72的优势获胜，从而第七次夺得亚洲男篮锦标赛桂冠。这场比赛也是中国队与南朝鲜队交战史上获胜的第二个高比分。
