Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 18th.

The Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee held its 10th Congress, 15th Plenary Session in Warsaw today to study the domestic situation and the party's tasks following the party's defeat in the June parliamentary elections and the failure to form a cabinet in August. The plenary session decided to seek opinions from the entire party on the issue of convening the party's 11th National Congress ahead of schedule.

This plenary session was the first central committee meeting held by the Polish United Workers' Party after the former opposition Solidarity Trade Union formed a government, the first non-communist-led government in over 40 years since the war. At today's session, Central Committee Political Bureau member and Central Committee Secretary Milewski reported on the current domestic political situation and the party's ideological state.

Milewski said that the Polish United Workers' Party is currently in a "critical period," experiencing for the first time in its 41-year history of rule that it is in the minority in both the parliament and the government. In this situation, the majority of party members are concerned about the party's future and suggest that the party itself undergo profound reforms, demanding that the leadership explain and answer some questions. Milewski believes that the feelings of the party members are "understandable," and their demands are "reasonable."

In his report, Milewski explained the reasons for the Polish United Workers' Party's participation in the Solidarity-led government. He said that only by participating in the new government could the party influence the political program and policies of the new government.

Milewski called on the entire party to strengthen its unity in the new situation, enhance the combat effectiveness of party organizations, connect with the masses, and improve work styles, thereby raising the party's prestige and "winning the trust of society." He hopes that the party will become a new type of socialist party on a new basis.

The plenary session adopted a document titled "On the Position of the Polish United Workers' Party in the Government."

The plenary session believes that it is urgent to convene the 11th National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party ahead of schedule and begin preparations for it.

In view of the fact that some local officials of Solidarity recently said in some factories that they wanted to "drive the Polish United Workers' Party organizations out of the factories," the plenary session today condemned this unreasonable demand and adopted a statement titled "On the Issue of the Party's Activities in Factories."

According to the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee spokesperson Bysztyga, the 15th Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party will be held in two stages. The first stage of the meeting will be held today for one day. The second stage of the meeting will be held before the end of September, with the agenda being the analysis of the results of the party's "public opinion survey" and, on this basis, determining the date and agenda for the convening of the party's "11th Congress."

Before the end of today's meeting, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, Rakowski, delivered a speech.

　　波党举行十届十五中全会
　　研究国内形势和党的任务
    全会谴责团结工会干扰该党基层组织活动
    新华社华沙9月18日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会今天在华沙举行第10届15中全会，研究统一工人党在今年6月波议会大选失败和8月份组阁受挫后的国内形势和党的任务。全会决定就提前召开党的第11次全国代表大会问题，在全党征求意见。
    这次全会是原来的政治反对派团结工会组阁，组成了战后40多年来第一个由非共产党人领导的政府后波党召开的第一次中央全会。在今天的全会上，统一工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记米莱尔就当前波国内政治形势和党内思想状况作了报告。
    米莱尔说，波兰统一工人党今天正处在一个“非常时期”，波党执政41年来第1次在议会和政府中“处于少数”。在这一形势下，广大党员普遍对党的前途表示关切，建议党本身进行深刻的改革，并要求党的领导对一些问题进行解释和回答。米莱尔认为，党员们的心情是“可以理解的”，他们的要求也是“合理的”。
    米莱尔在报告中解释了波党参加团结工会领导的政府的理由。他说，只有参加新政府，波党才能影响新政府的政治纲领和政策。
    米莱尔要求全党在新形势下加强自己队伍的团结，提高党组织的战斗力，联系群众和改进工作作风，通过这些途径来提高党的威信，“赢得社会的信任”。他希望党在新的基础上成为新型的社会主义政党。
    全会通过了《关于波兰统一工人党参加政府的立场》的文件。
    全会认为，提前召开波兰统一工人党第11次全国代表大会并开始其筹备工作是当务之急。
    鉴于团结工会的某些基层干部最近在一些工厂里说要把“统一工人党组织赶出工厂”，全会今天谴责了这一无理要求，并通过了一份《关于党在工厂活动问题的声明》。
    据波兰统一工人党中央新闻发言人比什蒂加今天在记者招待会上宣布，波党15中全会分两个阶段进行。第1阶段会议今天举行1天。第2阶段会议将于9月底以前举行，议题是分析全党的“民意调查”结果，并在这一基础上确定召开党的“11大”的日期和议题。
    在今天的会议结束前，统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基发表了讲话。
