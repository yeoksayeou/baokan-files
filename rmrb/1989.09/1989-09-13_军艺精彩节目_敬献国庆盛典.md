The People's Daily reports that the faculty and students of the PLA Academy of Arts, filled with patriotic fervor, have prepared a series of outstanding performances with strong ideological content and high artistic and entertainment value to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Among these performances, created and performed by the faculty and students of the Military Art Academy, the grand women's collective dance "Hua Flower Ode" is majestic and ethereal.

The no-intermission play "A Beacon of Light on the Horizon," which has garnered attention both within and outside the military, sings the praises of the selfless dedication of China's border defense troops amidst the complex realities of life.

Sopranos Dong Wenhua, Qin Lufeng, Zheng Li, and Wang Jing, who have undergone rigorous training at the Military Art Academy's Music Department, are currently rehearsing and will present their heartfelt songs for the National Day celebration.
