On the eve of the nation celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the great socialist motherland, the National Conference to Commend Advanced Grassroots Party Organizations and Excellent Party Affairs Workers was held in Beijing today. This is a joyous event in our party's political life. We extend our highest respects to the advanced grassroots party organizations on various fronts that have made outstanding achievements in the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up, and to the excellent party affairs workers who have worked diligently and selflessly for the party's cause!

The advanced grassroots party organizations and excellent party affairs workers being commended this time are outstanding representatives of nearly 3 million grassroots party organizations nationwide, tens of thousands of full-time party affairs workers, and several million part-time party affairs workers. They have made outstanding contributions in their respective positions, creatively completed the tasks assigned by the party, and are worthy of the glorious title of Communist Party member, truly embodying the spirit of the times.

Our party bears the historic mission of uniting the people of all ethnic groups in the country, relying on our own efforts, and striving through hard work to achieve the four modernizations. To fulfill this glorious historic mission, every party organization and party affairs worker should actively and proactively propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and unite the broad masses to strive for the implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies.

This commendation conference is being held shortly after the suppression of a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. Our party and our country have once again undergone a baptism of struggle, and every Communist Party member has undergone a severe test. History has once again proven that the socialist path chosen by the Chinese people cannot be changed, and the leadership position and role of the party cannot be shaken. This is the foundation of our state and also what the enemy fears the most. In the future, we must arm all party comrades and the people of the entire country with this fundamental thought, and use this fundamental thought to guide all our work. The grassroots party organizations and all party affairs workers have an important responsibility in fulfilling this historic mission and have much work to do. The holding of this conference will surely elevate the construction of grassroots party organizations and the level of party affairs workers to a new stage.

The grassroots party organizations are the cells of the party's body, the link between the party and the masses, and the foundation on which the party relies for its existence. The role of the grassroots party organizations is closely related to the leadership role of the party. Only by fully playing the role of the grassroots party organizations can we unite, mobilize, and lead the broad masses of the people to implement the party's various policies, principles, and proposals. If the grassroots party organizations have cohesion, attraction, combat effectiveness, and vitality, the entire party will be full of vigor, vitality, and unyielding strength, becoming an invincible fighting collective.

To enhance the combat effectiveness of the party organizations, we need to cultivate and train a team of party affairs workers who are politically mature, proficient in party work, have practical experience, and are deeply loved by the masses. They are the faithful executors of the party's line, principles, and policies, the propagandists who carry the party's proposals to the masses, and the exemplars of the party's fine traditions and style. This team, which has grown up in the practice of revolution and construction, is the backbone of the party's cause and a precious asset of the party.

Commemorating advanced grassroots party organizations and excellent party affairs workers nationwide is the first time since the founding of the nation and is also an inspection of the construction of grassroots party organizations and the party affairs work team in recent years. Through extensive publicity and commendation, it will surely promote righteousness, inspire the sense of historic mission among the broad party affairs workers, further play the political core role of grassroots party organizations, and promote the construction of the party.

Our party is a ruling party with 48 million members. The grassroots party organizations and outstanding party members are scattered throughout factories, rural areas, government agencies, schools, the military, and various industries. All our grassroots party organizations and party affairs workers should fully recognize their historic mission and glorious responsibility, with a strong sense of revolutionary cause and historical responsibility, overcome difficulties, eliminate interference, work diligently, innovate continuously, not seek personal gain, and selflessly contribute, to build our party well, and become the strong core leading the great socialist cause!

    神圣的使命　光荣的责任
　　——祝贺全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会召开
　　本报评论员
    在举国欢庆社会主义伟大祖国诞生四十周年前夕，全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会今天在北京隆重召开。这是我们党政治生活中的一件喜事。我们谨向各条战线上为社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业作出显著成绩的先进基层党组织，向为党的事业勤奋工作、无私奉献的优秀党务工作者们，致以崇高的敬意！
    这次受到表彰的先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者，是全国近300万个基层党组织、几十万名专职党务工作者和几百万名兼职党务工作者中的优秀代表，他们在各自的岗位上做出了突出贡献，创造性地完成了党交给的任务，无愧于共产党员的光荣称号，是真正的时代精英。
    我们党肩负着团结全国各族人民，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，实现四个现代化的历史重任。为了实现这一光荣的历史使命，每一个党的组织和党务工作者，都应积极、主动地去宣传群众，组织群众，把广大群众紧紧地团结起来，为落实党的路线、方针、政策而努力奋斗。
    这一次表彰大会是在北京平息了一场惊心动魄的反革命暴乱之后不久召开的。我们党和我们国家又经历了一场战斗的洗礼，每一个共产党员都经受了严峻的考验。历史再一次证明，中国人民选定的社会主义道路不能改变，党的领导地位和作用不能动摇。这是我们的立国之本，也是敌人最害怕的东西。今后，必须用这一根本思想武装全党同志和全国人民，用这一根本思想指导我们的一切工作。党的基层组织和全体党务工作者在完成这一历史使命上负有重要责任，要做许多工作。这次会议的召开，必将把党的基层组织建设和党务工作者的水平提高到一个新的阶段。
    党的基层组织是党的肌体的细胞，是党联系群众的纽带，是党赖以生存的基础。基层党组织的作用和党的领导作用息息相关，紧密相联，只有充分发挥基层党组织的作用，才能团结、动员和带领广大人民群众，实现党提出的各项方针、政策和主张。基层党组织有凝聚力、吸引力、战斗力，充满活力，整个党才会朝气蓬勃，生机盎然，无比坚强，才能成为无往而不胜的战斗集体。
    提高党组织的战斗力，需要培养和造就一支政治上成熟、精通党的工作、有实践经验、深受群众拥护的党务工作者队伍。他们是党的路线、方针、政策的忠实执行者，是把党的主张贯彻到群众中去的宣传鼓动者，是党的优良传统和作风的示范者。在革命和建设实践中成长起来的这支队伍，是党的事业的骨干力量，是党的宝贵财富。
    在全国范围内表彰先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者，这是建国以来的首次，也是对近年来党的基层组织建设和党务工作队伍的一次检阅。通过大力宣传和表彰，必将弘扬正气，激励广大党务工作者的历史使命感，进一步发挥基层党组织的政治核心作用，推动党的建设。
    我们党是一个有4800万党员的执政党。党的基层组织和党的优秀分子遍布于工厂、农村、机关、学校、军队等各行各业。我们所有的基层党组织和党务工作者，应该充分认识自己的历史使命和光荣职责，以强烈的革命事业心和历史责任感，克服困难，排除干扰，勤奋工作，不断创新，不计得失，无私奉献，把我们的党建设好，成为领导社会主义伟大事业的坚强核心！
