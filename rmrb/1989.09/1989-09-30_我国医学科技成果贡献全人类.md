Standing tall in the world of medical science, New China's medical science and technology have, over the past 40 years, contributed a wealth of achievements to humanity, some of which have reached international leading levels.

Creating Microsurgery Technology

In January 1963, Chen Zhongwei and others at Shanghai's Sixth People's Hospital successfully reattached a functional hand to a young worker named Wang Cunbo. This groundbreaking achievement in medical history was recognized by an international authority in September of the same year. Since then, with the aid of surgical microscopes, microvascular anastomosis devices, and other specialized equipment and techniques, limb reattachment technology has developed into a mature microsurgery technique. Its application has expanded from limbs to neurosurgery and plastic surgery. In 1978, Yu Zhongjia of the same hospital created the extraordinary "hand or complete finger reconstruction technique" for patients with forearm amputations or complete finger loss, enabling the reconstructed hand to perform self-care and return to work. Later, Yang Dongyue and Gu Yudong of Shanghai Huashan Hospital developed the technique of reconstructing the thumb using a toe, achieving a 95% success rate in 226 cases, setting a world record. Today, specialized hand surgery departments have been established in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin.

Wang Zhongcheng of the Beijing Institute of Neurosurgery applied microsurgery techniques to brain tumor resection surgery, reducing the surgical mortality rate from 22% to 1.6%, attracting the attention of international peers.

Outstanding Achievements in Cancer Research

In the study of esophageal cancer, Lu Shixin of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and others discovered for the first time in the world that fungi in the human stomach can synthesize carcinogenic nitrosamines, and through large-scale population experiments, proved that vitamins C and E, and zinc can inhibit the synthesis of these nitrosamines.

Tang Zhaoyou of Shanghai Medical University applied the new technique of antigen penetration rocket electrophoresis autoradiography in liver cancer research, discovering the serum immunological changes in the early stages of liver cancer, improving the early diagnosis rate, and increasing the 5-year survival rate of liver cancer surgery from 2.6% to 72.9%. This achievement won the "Early Treatment, Early Cure" gold medal from the United States in 1979.

Song Hongzhao of Peking Union Medical College used multiple chemical drugs to cure the deadly choriocarcinoma, creating a world miracle where 85% of childbearing-age patients gave birth to children after being cured. According to statistics on 741 cases of choriocarcinoma patients, the survival rate for more than 10 years reached over 75%, and more than half survived for over 15 years. Among them, 46 cases had cancer that had metastasized to the lungs, brain, liver, and other organs at the time of admission, but were all cured.

The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine's Zhang Yi and others established the world's first prospective study site for nasopharyngeal cancer, which can detect very early-stage patients with a detection rate of up to 97%. They also discovered that 52 kinds of herbs have the effect of inducing nasopharyngeal cancer, highlighting the importance of environmental factors.

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine Spread Globally

In 1971, China officially announced the research and application of acupuncture anesthesia to the world, causing a sensation in the medical community and sparking a global "acupuncture fever." In recent years, acupuncture research in China has made new breakthroughs. To date, over 2 million surgeries have been performed under acupuncture anesthesia in China, covering more than 100 types of diseases. Among them, 4,466 cases of cranial surgery had excellent analgesic effects, accounting for 76.6%.

Since the 1960s, in Latin America and some Asian regions with severe malaria outbreaks, the efficacy of chloroquine has significantly decreased, resulting in over 2 million deaths from malaria each year. The World Health Organization listed malaria prevention and treatment as an international challenge, mobilizing pharmacologists worldwide to find new anti-malarial drugs. Chinese scientists extracted artemisinin from the traditional Chinese herb Artemisia annua, which has been used for over 2,000 years, using modern technology. The new anti-malarial drug developed from it is superior to other methods in terms of killing malaria parasites, reducing fever time, parasite recurrence rate, and toxic side effects. The World Health Organization stated that "the artemisinin invented by China is a great contribution to world medicine." The traditional Chinese medicine preparation "Shenfu Qing Injection" treats severe malaria infection shock with an 80% mortality rate, rapidly raises blood pressure, maintains the effect for a long time, and does not produce drug dependence. The overall effectiveness rate is as high as 84.6%, significantly better than the commonly used Western drugs dopamine and alarmin (overall effectiveness rate of 67.7%).

The Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine discovered, through research on the traditional prescription "Liuwei Dihuang Pill," the high risk of cancer in patients with severe kidney yin deficiency. This research revealed that the Liuwei Dihuang Pill has new functions in inhibiting chemical carcinogenesis and reducing cancer incidence, providing a new effective method for the treatment and prevention of esophageal cancer with traditional Chinese medicine. This achievement has been widely recognized by the academic community at home and abroad.

In addition, China has made significant progress in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with several projects leading the world. For example, a nationwide survey of 4 million people aged 15 and above for hypertension was conducted in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; the self-made biological heart valve, with a valve damage rate of only 0.65% after 10 years of follow-up, and the development of extracorporeal counterpulsation devices have reached a high level.

In the prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis, breakthroughs have also been made. The infection rate, main transmission routes, and mother-to-child transmission patterns of hepatitis B have been preliminarily understood. The quality of the self-developed and mass-produced hepatitis B blood-derived vaccine has reached an advanced international level. Last year, China's first attenuated live hepatitis A vaccine also passed small-scale human trials.

    我国医学科技成果贡献全人类
    王秀峰　王亨生
    屹立于世界医学之林的新中国医学科学技术，40年来为人类奉献了一大批成果，其中有一些达到了国际领先的水平。
    创建显微外科技术
    1963年1月，上海市第六人民医院陈中伟等为青年工人王存柏接活了一只功能恢复满意的断手。这一世界医学史上的创举当年9月就被国际权威组织确认。自此以后，借助于手术显微镜、小血管吻合器等专用装置和技术，断肢再植技术发展成为成熟的显微外科技术。应用范围从四肢扩展到神经外科、整形外科。1978年，这个医院的于仲嘉又创造了非凡的“手或全手指缺失的再造技术”，用于前臂截肢或五指全缺的病人，使再造的新手可以自理生活和重新劳动。后来，上海华山医院的杨东岳和顾玉东又创造了足趾移位再造拇指技术，并创226例成活率95％的世界最高水平。现在，在我国的上海、北京、天津都已有了手外科专科。
    北京神经外科研究所王忠诚把显微外科技术用于脑肿瘤切除手术，已使手术死亡率从22％降至1.6％，令国际同行瞩目。
    癌症研究成绩卓著
    中国医科院肿瘤研究所陆士新等对食管癌的研究中，在世界上首次发现真菌在人胃中可合成致癌的亚硝胺，并通过大量人群实验证明，维生素C和E、锌能阻断这种亚硝胺的合成。
    上海医科大学汤钊猷在肝癌研究中应用抗原渗入火箭电泳自显影新技术，发现了早期肝癌前期甲胎蛋白血清学变化规律，提高了早期诊断率，使肝癌手术5年生存率从2.6％提高到72.9％，此成果1979年获美国“早治早愈”金奖。
    北京协和医院宋鸿钊利用多种化学药物根治凶险的绒癌，创造了育龄患者治愈后85％生育了子女的世界奇迹。据对741例绒癌患者统计，生存10年者达75％以上，超过15年者占一半，其中还有46例在收治时，癌已转移到肺、脑、肝等，也都被治愈。
    中国预防医科院曾毅等在鼻咽癌研究中，建立了世界上第一个鼻咽癌前瞻性研究现场，可以查出很早期的病人，检出率高达97％。并发现52种草药有诱发鼻咽癌作用，提出了不容忽视的环境因素。
    中医中药“热”遍全球
    1971年我国正式向世界公布针刺麻醉的研究和应用情况，轰动了医学界，旋即掀起全球“针灸热”。近年，针灸研究在我国又有新的突破，现国内针麻下进行的手术已超200万例，适应病种100多个。其中颅脑手术4466例，镇痛效果优良者可占76.6％。
    从60年代开始，在拉美和亚洲一些恶性疟疾的重要流行区，已使用多年的氯喹药效锐减，每年死于疟疾者达200余万。世界卫生组织把疟疾的防治列为国际棘手问题，动员各国药学家寻找抗疟新药。我国科学家从已沿用2000多年的中草药青蒿中，用现代技术提取出青蒿素，用其研制出的抗疟新药在杀灭疟原虫速度、病人退热时间、原虫复燃率和毒副作用等方面都大大优于其它手段。世界卫生组织认为“中国发明的青蒿素对世界医学是一大贡献”。中药制剂“参附青注射液”治疗死亡率高达80％的急重疟感染性休克，升压快，作用维持时间长，血压稳定后即能停药，也不产生药物依赖，总有效率高达84.6％，显著优于现用西药多巴胺和阿拉明（总有效67.7％）。
    中国中医研究院中药研究所从对传统名方“六味地黄汤”的研究中，首次发现肾阴虚重症患者癌变的高度危险性。这项研究揭示了中药六味地黄汤制剂有抑制化学致癌、降低癌发病率的新功效，为中医药治疗和预防食管癌提供了新的有效方法。这一成果得到国内外学界的普遍重视。
    此外，我国在心脑肺血管疾病的防治研究方面，不少项目也处于国际前列。如在全国29省区和直辖市进行400万15岁以上人口的高血压抽样普查；成功地用于临床的自制生物心瓣膜，随访第10年瓣膜损坏率仅为0.65％人年，以及体外反搏装置的研制达到高水平等。
    在病毒性肝炎的防治研究方面，也取得突破性进展。已初步摸清乙肝人群感染率、主要传播途径和母婴传播规律，自行研制并批量生产的乙肝血源性疫苗质量已达国际先进水平；去年，我国首创的甲肝减毒活疫苗也通过了小量人群试验。
