Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger today refuted attacks by some Americans on his views regarding the maintenance of U.S.-China relations and opposition to sanctions against China during an interview with the CNN program "Saturday Night News Figures."

Kissinger responded to an article in the *Wall Street Journal* on September 15 that accused him of "mixing his analysis of events in China with his own business interests in China." He said, "This is a way for those who disagree with my views to threaten me, to shut me up, and prevent me from expressing my opinions."

He stated that after leaving the government, he did not engage in any business activities for four years and did not engage in any consulting activities for six years.

He pointed out, "The assumption that commercial considerations influence my public judgments is an immoral act."

After China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, Kissinger had published an article through the Los Angeles Times Syndicate in multiple newspapers, stating that China's suppression of the riot was an internal affair, opposing further "sanctions" against China by some people, and hoping to maintain normal U.S.-China relations.

　　仗义执言反受攻击　何言自由
　　美前国务卿基辛格　据理反驳
    新华社华盛顿9月16日电　美国前国务卿亨利·基辛格博士，今天在接受有线新闻电视网《星期六新闻人物》专题节目记者采访时，驳斥某些美国人对他发表关于维护美中关系、反对对中国进行“制裁”的意见所进行的攻击。
    基辛格在谈到关于《华尔街日报》15日载文攻击他“把对中国的事件的分析同自己在中国的商业利益相混合”时说，“这是那些不同意我的观点的人对我进行恫吓的一种方式，他们企图封住我的口，不让我发表观点。”
    他说，他离开政府后，4年之内没有从事任何商业活动；6年之内，没有从事任何咨询活动。
    他指出，“关于商业考虑影响我公开表达判断的假设，是一种违犯道德的行为。”
    中国平息反革命暴乱后，基辛格曾通过《洛杉矶时报》报业辛迪加在多家报纸上同时发表文章，指出中国平息暴乱属于中国内政，反对某些人对中国进行进一步“制裁”的主张，希望维护美中正常关系。
