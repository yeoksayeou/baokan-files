The mineral resources in Tibet's 1.2 million square kilometers of land are extremely rich. Of the 150 known minerals in the world, 76 have been discovered in Tibet. Among the minerals with proven reserves, Tibet ranks in the top five in the country for 13 types, including chromite, copper, borax, and gypsum. Geothermal resources rank first in the country and are now an important energy source in Tibet. There is also the so-called "new noble metal" lithium, with potential reserves ranking among the world's top.

Since the democratic reforms of 1959, and especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Tibet's rich mineral resources have gradually been developed and utilized.

In 1959, the first coal mine in northern Tibet was established. Now, there are 54 mines in the entire region. The value of the mining industry accounts for one-quarter of the region's industrial output. The Yangbajing Geothermal Field, located northwest of Lhasa, is the largest geothermal field in the country and has built a megawatt-level geothermal power station.

　　诱人的西藏矿产资源
    在西藏120万平方公里的土地上，地质矿产资源十分丰富。世界上已知矿产有150种，在西藏已发现76种；在已探明储量的矿产中，西藏有铬铁矿、铜矿、硼砂矿和石膏等13种矿的储量居全国前五名之内；地热资源雄踞全国第一，目前已成为西藏的重要能源；还有被称为“金属新贵”的锂矿，潜在储量居世界前列。
    1959年实行民主改革，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，西藏丰富的矿产资源逐步得到开发利用。
    1959年在藏北高原建立了西藏第一座煤矿，如今，全区已建矿54个。采矿业的产值已占全区工业产值的1／4。位于拉萨西北的羊八井地热田是全国最大的地热田，已建成万千瓦级地热发电站。
