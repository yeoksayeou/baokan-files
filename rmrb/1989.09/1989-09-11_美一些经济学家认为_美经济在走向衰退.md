Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th.

According to a report by the *Christian Science Monitor*, the chief economist of the First Fidelity Financial Company of the United States, Mickey Levy, asserts that the probability of the U.S. economy experiencing a recession next year has exceeded 50%.

He pointed out that although the recently released statistics are relatively optimistic, this is merely a temporary relief in a period of slowing economic growth.

To support his prediction that the economy will further slow down, Levy provided the following reasons:

	• In the second quarter, the after-tax profits of U.S. companies fell by 5.4%, the largest decline since the first quarter of 1986 when company profits fell by 16.5%.
	• The increase in the gross national product was mainly due to the improvement in automobile sales in the second quarter. Automobile manufacturers offered price discounts and negotiable interest rates. "These will have to be made up for in the future."
	• Various economic indicators show that economic growth will slow down. Industrial production is stagnant. The utilization rate of production equipment has declined from its peak in January. The growth in the number of non-military sector employees is slowing down.
	• Monetary policy remains tight. After excluding the factor of inflation, various indicators measuring money supply are still declining. Money is the fuel of the economy. A decrease in the money supply will ultimately slow down business activities.

　　美一些经济学家认为
　　美经济在走向衰退
    新华社北京9月11日电　据《基督教科学箴言报》报道，美国第一信诚金融公司首席经济学家米基·利维断言，美国明年出现经济衰退的可能性已超过50％。
    他指出，最近公布的统计数字较为乐观，但这只是“在经济增长放慢的时期中暂时的缓解”。
    为了证明他关于经济将进一步放慢的预言，利维提供了如下根据：
    ——第二季度，完税后的美国各公司的利润下降了5.4％，这是自1986年第一季度公司利润下降16.5％后下降幅度最大一次。
    ——国民生产总值的提高主要是第二季度汽车销售状况好转带来的。汽车制造商提出价格折让和可讨价还价的利率。“这些要从将来找回来。”
    ——各种经济指标表明经济增长将会放慢。工业生产发展平平。生产设备利用率从1月份的顶峰下降。非军事部门人员受雇人数增长正在放慢。
    ——货币政策仍然是紧缩的。在扣除了通货膨胀的因素后，各种衡量货币的指标仍然在下降。货币是经济的燃料。货币供应的下降最终将使企业活动放慢。
