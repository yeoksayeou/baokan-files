Fujian Actively Establishes Enterprises Overseas, Leading the Nation with Nearly 200 Companies

FUZHOU, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Fujian, one of the earliest provinces in China to open up to the outside world, has not only attracted more than $1.1 billion to establish over 2,400 "three-in-one" enterprises, but has also set up nearly 200 enterprises overseas. In the first half of this year, these enterprises, which are located in nearly 20 countries and regions across five continents, ranked first among all provinces and municipalities on the mainland in terms of the number of enterprises, the amount of newly signed contracts, completed business revenue, and the number of overseas labor personnel.

Fujian's overseas enterprises started with setting up trade windows in Hong Kong and Macao, and in recent years have gradually expanded to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, America, Africa, and Australia. They now cover various industries such as real estate, construction contracting, financial investment, agriculture, forestry, fishery, transportation, tourism, industrial processing, advertising, information, and trade.

These enterprises, which have already taken root, have not only achieved significant economic benefits but have also had a certain impact in their respective locations. The subsidiaries of the China-Fujian Company in Hong Kong and Macao have become competitive players in the local construction market. In several influential large construction project bidding competitions, they have won bids multiple times, earning a reputation and entering the ranks of companies eligible to operate government projects.

While achieving stable development, these overseas enterprises have also utilized external funds, technology, and equipment to establish enterprises back in the province, setting up more than 70 joint ventures and cooperative enterprises, attracting over $20 million in foreign capital. They have also provided guarantees for mainland enterprises, attracting billions of dollars in foreign investment.

　　福建在境外积极兴办企业
　　已建近二百家居全国之首
    本报福州九月十八日电　记者张铭清报道：我国最早实行对外开放的福建省，不但已吸收十一亿多美元兴办了两千四百多家“三资”企业，还在境外办了一百九十多家企业。今年上半年，这些分布于世界五大洲近二十个国家和地区的境外企业，其数量和新签合同金额、完成的营业额、在外劳务人员数等，均居大陆各省市之首。
    福建在境外办企业起步于在港澳办贸易窗，近几年逐步发展到东南亚、中东，以及欧、美、非、澳洲。现在已形成房地产经营、承包建筑、金融投资、农林水产、交通航运、旅游、工业加工、广告信息、贸易等多种行业的格局。
    这些已经站稳脚跟的企业，不仅取得了明显的经济效益，而且在当地产生了一定影响。中福公司在港、澳的分公司，成为当地建筑市场颇具竞争实力的企业，在一些有影响的大建筑项目投标竞争中多次中标，赢得了声誉，进入能够经营政府工程的几家公司行列。
    这些在境外兴办的企业，在取得稳定发展的同时，还利用外资、技术、设备再回到省内办企业，已办起七十多家合资、合作企业，引进外资二千多万美元。它们还为内地企业提供担保，引进外资达数亿美元。
