	The new academic year has begun, and the freshmen of Beijing No. 62 Middle School, under the guidance of their teachers, have come to the training base of the General Staff Engineering Corps in the suburbs of Beijing for a two-week military training camp. The intense and serious training has enhanced their courage and confidence to endure hardships and overcome difficulties. Collective life not only cultivates their ability to manage and serve themselves but also strengthens their sense of collectivism, unity, and mutual assistance. The experiences and observations from the military camp life have deepened the students' understanding and love for the People's Liberation Army.

    中学生军训生活一瞥
    北京市62中学高中一年级新生新学年开始，在老师带领下来到京郊总参工程兵训练团驻地，进行了为期两周的军事生活锻炼。紧张、严肃的训练增强了他们艰苦奋斗、克服困难的勇气和信心。集体生活既培养了自我管理、自我服务的能力，又加强了他们团结友爱和互相帮助的的集体主义观念。军营生活的所见所闻，使同学们增进了对解放军的理解和热爱。
