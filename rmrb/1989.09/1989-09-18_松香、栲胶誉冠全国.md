The forty years since liberation have seen the rapid development of Guangxi's forest chemical industry. Today, Guangxi's annual pine resin production accounts for more than one-third of the national total, leading all provinces and municipalities in the industry. The Wuzhou Pine Resin Factory has become the largest forest chemical plant in Asia. The Baise and Wuming lacquer factories each have an annual production capacity of over 10,000 tons. In recent years, Guangxi's pine resin has been renowned in 56 countries and regions around the world, becoming a major source of foreign exchange earnings for Guangxi. Lacquer is also beginning to enter the international market.
