Recently, the tightening measures taken to control the economic environment and curb excessive total demand have caused some comrades to worry. They fear that China's economy may fall into "stagflation," and some even believe that China's economy has already begun to show signs of "stagflation." To address this question, we need to understand the original meaning of "stagflation" and its causes, and then analyze it in the context of China's economic reality.

The term "stagflation" originates from Western economic theory. In its original sense, it is a type of inflation characterized by "recession with inflation." "Stagflation" is also known as "demand-shift" or "structural" inflation, which are more accurate descriptions. In the Western economy, this type of "stagflation" occurred in the 1970s. Since the 1970s, and especially in the mid-to-late 1980s, developed Western countries experienced drastic industrial structural adjustments. Under these conditions, combined with certain non-equilibrium characteristics in the economies of these developed countries, "stagflation" became possible. These non-equilibrium characteristics come from two main aspects. On one hand, due to the high level of specialization and division of labor in modern developed economies, the free movement of human and non-human resources between different industries has become more difficult and time-consuming. On the other hand, the price and wage rigidity in economies of scale hinder price adjustments. This makes it difficult for prices to fall in sectors where demand is decreasing; they often only reduce production to match the decreased demand. In sectors where demand is increasing, due to the sluggish flow of resources, it is also difficult to increase production in a short period to meet the growing demand, leading to continuous price increases. In this way, during drastic industrial structural changes, sectors with decreasing demand see reduced production but high prices; while sectors with increasing demand see rising prices but limited production growth. When this situation reaches a certain extent, it results in economic growth slowing down while the overall price level rises, leading to "recession with inflation," or the original meaning of "stagflation." Even if total supply and total demand are in balance, this type of "stagflation" can still occur.

If we analyze China's economic reality based on the original meaning of "stagflation," it is clear that China's economy does not have the conditions for "stagflation" to occur.

Firstly, the direct cause of inflation in China's economy is that total demand has long been greater than total supply, resulting in a demand-pull type of inflation. This is fundamentally different from "demand-shift" inflation in terms of cause.

Secondly, China's current industrial structural imbalances are different in nature from the drastic industrial structural changes and imbalances that occurred in Western developed countries during the technological revolution. China's economy has long been in a state of overall shortage, with total demand significantly exceeding total supply. Under these circumstances, even if demand in certain sectors decreases, it does not have a decisive impact on the overall adjustment of the national economic structure.

Thirdly, if the "stagflation" that people are worried about refers to a situation where economic growth slows down due to the implementation of tightening measures, and where the upward trend in prices has not been significantly curbed in the initial tightening period, then this situation deviates from the original meaning of "stagflation." Although this situation is phenomenally similar to "stagflation," it is of a different nature and should not be confused. More importantly, this understanding also overlooks the fact that controlling inflation requires a process. The experience of various countries shows that controlling demand-pull inflation will inevitably lead to a decrease in production or a decline in the growth rate for a certain period. This is a price that must be paid. Otherwise, inflation cannot be eradicated. From the development process of inflation, the initial stage is generally characterized by increased production and relatively small impact on prices, followed by a significant increase in prices with only a slight increase in production. Controlling inflation, on the other hand, involves initially reducing the growth rate or decreasing commodity production, rather than controlling prices. Only after overcoming this difficulty will a turning point appear. Because, measures to curb total demand, even if technically appropriate, are still a double-edged sword. They cut down excessive demand while also affecting some supply. What we can do is only to minimize the adverse impact on supply to the lowest possible extent. It is important to emphasize that during the process of controlling excessive total demand, a situation phenomenally similar to "stagflation" will inevitably occur, but it is precisely the beginning of a turning point.

Additionally, from the perspective of economic growth rate, the near-20% super-high-speed growth caused by last year's economic overheating was an abnormal and pathological condition. It not only exacerbated the severe industrial structural imbalances but also exceeded the realistic foundation of the national economy. This requires rectification and adjustment to cool down the overheated economy. From the situation in the first few months of this year, China's economic growth rate will still be around 10%. Based on this, there is no reason to believe that China's economy will experience, or has already experienced, "stagflation."

    怎样认识经济滞胀？
    陈及
    近些时来，由治理经济环境而对总需求膨胀所采取的紧缩，引起一些同志的忧虑。他们担心我国经济会由此而发生“滞胀”，有人甚至认为我国经济已开始出现“滞胀”。为了回答这个问题，需要弄清“滞胀”的本意及其产生的原因，并与我国经济实际结合起来进行分析。
    “滞胀”这一术语源自西方经济理论，从本来的含义说，它是通货膨胀型式中的一种，是对“并发通货膨胀的衰退”一词的简称。“滞胀”又称“需求移动型”或“结构型”通货膨胀，这后两种说法是更为贴切的表述。在西方经济中，这种
  “滞胀”发生于70年代。70年代以来，特别是80年代中后期，西方发达国家出现剧烈的产业结构调整。在此条件下，再加上西方发达国家经济中某些非均衡的特征，就使得“滞胀”成为可能。这种非均衡的特征主要来自两方面。一方面，由于现代发达经济中高度发展的专业化分工，使人力和非人力资源在不同产业之间的自由转移的跨度和难度增大，时滞也越来越长。另一方面，来自规模经济中的价格和工资刚性，从而使价格调节受到阻滞。这使得在需求下降的部门，产品价格却很难下降，它们往往只是以产量的减少去适应需求的减少；而在需求上升的部门，因资源流动的呆滞，也很难在一定时期内扩大产量以满足需求的增长，这就使得这些部门产品的价格一涨再涨。这样在产业结构剧烈变动中，需求下降的部门产品产量减少了，价格却居高不下；而需求增长的部门，产品价格不断上涨而产量一时却难以相应增长。这种情况增加到一定程度，就会造成在经济增长率下降的同时物价总水平上升，于是因“需求移动”或“结构”矛盾就导致了“并发通货膨胀的衰退”，即本来意义的“滞胀”。这时，即使总供给和总需求达到平衡，这种“滞胀”也会发生。
    如果从“滞胀”的这种本义出发去分析我国经济的现实，很显然，我国经济并不具备产生“滞胀”的条件。
    首先，我国经济中发生的通货膨胀的直接起因，是由于总需求长期大于总供给，是一种需求拉上型的通货膨胀。它在起因上，是根本不同于“需求移动型”通货膨胀的。
    其次，我国目前的产业结构失调同导致
  “滞胀”的西方发达国家伴随科技革命而来的产业结构剧烈变动与失调，在性质上也是不同的。我国经济长期以来基本上处于总需求显著超过总供给的全面紧缺的状态，在这种情况下，即使某些部门的需求有所下降，它对整个国民经济结构的调节也并不具有决定意义。
    再次，如果说人们担心的“滞胀”是指一方面随紧缩措施的实行带来了经济增长速度的下降，另一方面在紧缩初期还并未带来对物价上涨势头的明显遏制的这样一种情况，那么，此种情况已脱离了“滞胀”的本来含义。虽然这种情况在现象上同“滞胀”有某些相似之处，但具有不同的性质，不宜混为一谈。更重要的是，这种认识也忽略了治理通货膨胀需要有一个过程。各国的经验表明，治理需求拉上型通货膨胀，必然带来一定时期内产量的下降或增长率的回落。这是不得不付出的代价。否则便不能根除通货膨胀。从通货膨胀发展的过程看，初期阶段一般是拉上产量，而影响物价较小，然后是物价较大幅度上涨，而产量仅有微弱的增加。而治理通货膨胀则相反，初期是降低增长率或减少商品生产，而不是平抑物价。只有度过这个难关，转机才会出现。因为，抑制总需求的措施，即使在技术上是得当的，也仍然是一柄双刃剑，它在削掉过量需求的同时，也会伤及某些供给。我们所能做到的，仅仅是把对供给的不利影响减少到可能低的限度而已。需要强调的是，在治理总需求过大的过程中，必然出现在现象上类似于“滞胀”的情况，但它正是出现转机的开端。
    此外，从经济增长速度上看，去年经济过热造成的接近于20％的超高速增长，是一种反常的病态，它不仅加剧了产业结构的严重失调，也超出了国民经济的现实基础，这就需要通过治理整顿，使过热的经济降温。从今年头几个月的情况看，我国经济的增长速度仍会在10％左右。据此，也没有任何理由认为我国经济会发生、甚至已经发生了“滞胀”。
