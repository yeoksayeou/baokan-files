The China Youth Magazine's ninth issue published the responses of the spokesperson for the State Council, Yuan Mu, to questions from young friends, addressing some of the thoughts and questions raised by young people. The full text is as follows:

Q: We opposed corruption and official profiteering, and went out to march and demonstrate. This was out of patriotism and to promote democracy. Why can't we say it was a patriotic and democratic movement, but instead it is called a turmoil?

A: We fully understand the feelings of young people. For the majority of young students who participated in the marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes in the previous period, they were filled with enthusiasm to promote democracy, deepen reforms, oppose corruption, and punish corrupt officials. Their subjective wishes were good. I think that the Party and the government have always held this view and still hold it now. However, when the truth about the turmoil evolving into a counter-revolutionary riot became clear to the world, some young friends still have this understanding of the problem and raise this question. In terms of thought and emotion, they still can't turn the corner, which makes one deeply feel that the task of using facts to mobilize and organize young friends to educate themselves, reflect deeply, and summarize experiences and lessons is indeed heavy.

Compared to you, I certainly have many shortcomings, but I may also have one advantage, which is that I understand more about the history and current situation of our country. I remember that before we had the first dialogue with young students on April 29 on behalf of the State Council, we had studied a lot of materials, talked to some university students, and made full preparations. At that time, we felt that the matter was indeed not simple. A large amount of evidence shows that this turmoil, from the beginning, had a few people using the student movement to create incidents, expand the situation, and try to achieve their goals that they could not achieve under conditions of social stability. Among these few people, most were the "long-bearded" people hiding behind the scenes, that is, those who have long insisted on bourgeois liberalization views and political conspiracies, and there were also some student leaders on the front stage with various different ambitions. In the dialogue, we repeatedly reminded the students to be vigilant about this situation and sincerely told the students to consciously draw a clear line with a few people with ulterior motives. The best way to draw a clear line is to immediately stop illegal marches and demonstrations and quickly return to school to resume classes, and solve problems through normal democratic and legal channels. Our reminders and warnings may have alerted some people, but at that time, many people, even most people, did not take it seriously. Today, the development of the situation has provided sufficient materials. I suggest that everyone calmly and comprehensively look at the relevant materials. I believe that after obtaining correct and comprehensive information, you will gradually change your views. In any case, do not read the newspapers or watch TV, and only act on emotions. This is not good for the country or for yourself. Here, I won't say much more, just propose two viewpoints for your reference when reflecting.

First, the nature of a historical event is not determined by the subjective wishes of the participants, but by the political program of the event, its objective development process, its effects, and its results. Take the "Great Leap Forward" of that year. Can you say that the wishes of the vast majority of participants were not good? No. They wanted to develop our economy as quickly as possible and in the shortest time, to overtake Britain and catch up with America, which was very good! However, historical practice has proven that the objective effect was not good. It violated objective laws, and the "Great Leap Forward" led to a "Great Leap Backward," causing serious damage to the national economy. As for the Cultural Revolution, what was the motive of the masses to participate in the movement at that time? Was the nature of the movement consistent with their motives? I'm afraid not! The ten-year turmoil became a ten-year "turmoil," isn't it the result of the leaders' wrong initiation, guided by wrong theories, and the counter-revolutionary clique taking advantage of it?

Second, it is not impossible for the good wishes of the majority to be led astray by a few people with evil intentions. This is not uncommon in the history of both China and foreign countries. The German people have always been known for their rationality, but their patriotic enthusiasm was also used by Hitler and used by fascism, resulting in a world tragedy. This event has repeated the historical tragedy from different aspects: the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses was used by a few people, leading to turmoil and riot. The vast majority of young students did not make the situation develop according to their good wishes, but consciously or unconsciously made the situation develop to the opposite of their wishes.

Fundamentally, to correctly understand this turmoil, one needs to establish a dialectical and materialist view of history, establish a worldview and life outlook of loyalty to socialism and communism, and have a firm and correct political stance. Regrettably or unfortunately, in recent years, there has been too little education for young people on the correct worldview, life outlook, and political stance. This can also be said to be an important lesson we should learn!

Q: How can a few people manipulate so many university students to participate in the student movement and then incite turmoil and riot? This shows what?

A: This question is well asked. After suppressing the riot, we need to calmly review the past, think about the future, summarize experiences and lessons, and avoid creating new turmoil. We need to seriously consider this question.

In the May 3 press conference for domestic and foreign journalists, I said: "A few people can indeed incite turmoil, and there are indeed profound economic, political, social, and ideological reasons for this. The situation is complicated." I still hold this view now.

It should be seen that in the past ten years of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction, our country's appearance has undergone profound changes recognized by the world, achieving unprecedented major achievements. However, there are indeed many shortcomings and mistakes in the work. For example: economic overheating, the appearance of relatively obvious inflation; the new order of socialist planned commodity economy has not been fully established, causing some official profiteering and unfair social distribution problems; the leadership of the Party, Party building, and ideological and political work have been weakened; corruption has emerged among some Party members and cadres; and so on. These shortcomings and mistakes have caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people. However, although there are various degrees of dissatisfaction among the people, fundamentally, the people support the leadership of the Communist Party and support socialism. This is the most basic objective fact in China. In contrast, the purpose of a few counter-revolutionary conspirators to create turmoil and even riot is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and overthrow the People's Republic of socialism. They often conceal their true intentions to achieve their conspiratorial purposes and loudly shout slogans such as "anti-official profiteering" and "anti-corruption" as "accompaniments." This has had a great deceptive effect on the broad masses, especially young students. In this turmoil and even riot, so many people were drawn in, and many people were used by bad people for a long time without realizing it. This cannot but be said to be an important reason.

It is particularly worth noting that from the turmoil to the riot, foreign hostile forces have been involved from beginning to end. The international monopoly bourgeoisie's desire to destroy us is undying, and they have launched a rampant joint attack on us. They aim to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and to incite the peaceful evolution of our socialist country. They took the opportunity of our reform and opening up, carefully planned, and spared no effort to carry out long-term ideological and political infiltration. A few people in China who have long insisted on bourgeois liberalization have been slavish and sought glory by selling out the country, adapting to this international climate, and colluding with external forces to carry out long-term anti-Party and anti-socialist ideological, public opinion, and organizational preparations. At the beginning of the student movement, a few people carefully planned and successively established illegal organizations such as "High Autonomous Federation" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation." They used some of our work mistakes, used the dissatisfaction of the people, and used the temporary difficulties we encountered in the economy, plus the protection and support of a few leaders within the Party, to create rumors, incite the masses, and confuse people's minds. Finally, the situation developed to the point of being increasingly difficult to control.

After the pain, to avoid similar turmoil from happening again, the Party and the government, as well as young friends, need to make arduous efforts. In summary, I think there are at least a few lessons that we should learn for a long time: First, under the condition that the overall international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation, the fundamental strategy of the international monopoly bourgeoisie to carry out the peaceful evolution of socialism has not changed, and we must not let our guard down; Second, under the condition that the exploiting class and the exploiting system have been eliminated in China, class struggle still exists within a certain range, and sometimes it can be very intense. This turmoil and riot are a concentrated manifestation of the intensification of class struggle. We must not forget this; Third, the four cardinal principles are the foundation of the country, and reform and opening up are the path to a strong country. The two must be combined and persistently and consistently adhered to, and we must not be soft on one hand and hard on the other, nor can we neglect one or the other; Fourth, the core leadership of the Party must be strengthened, and ideological and political work must be strengthened; Fifth, the construction of socialist democracy and legal system must be continued and strengthened, and the two must be well unified. In short, on the one hand, we must correct our thoughts, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and long-term oppose bourgeois liberalization, resolutely maintain a stable social and political environment. On the other hand, we must greatly improve our work, eliminate corruption, clean up official profiteering, solve the problem of unfair social distribution, and strive long-term for the healthy development of socialist planned commodity economy and the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Q: Students' hunger strike was voluntary. How can it become a "hostage" of a few people?

A: As far as I know, the situation of students participating in the hunger strike is not the same. From the form, some students participating in the hunger strike were "voluntary," but in fact, they were the result of being used by some bad people in their thoughts and being deceived by some rumors; some students participated in the hunger strike because they felt they had to in the environment and atmosphere at that time, under the influence of wrong public opinion guidance, they had to force themselves to participate; there were also some students who participated in the hunger strike at the beginning, but later regretted it. However, they were deceived by various wrong "support" and were forced to go to the extreme, wanting to stop but unable to. Of course, in the eyes of the hunger-striking students, if someone directly forced them to hunger strike and said they had been used by others as "hostages," they would find it difficult to accept. This is understandable. However, if we look at the ugly deeds of the organizers and planners of the turmoil, the problem is very clear. The head of the "High Autonomous Federation," Wang Dan, once bluntly said: "Choosing May 13 to start the hunger strike, it just happened to be able to borrow Gorbachev's visit to China to pressure them." The "they" he referred to here are our Party and our people's government. The heads of the illegal student organizations incited their classmates to hunger strike, with the purpose of being against the Party, against the people's government, using the methods of fighting against the enemy, using their classmates' lives as a bet, and even not hesitating to damage the international reputation of the Party and the country to blackmail the Party and the government to accept their political conditions for inciting the turmoil. This situation was already exposed at that time, so how can it not be recognized clearly now? After the hunger strike began, they used various opportunities to create rumors, incite the masses, and create public opinion, trying to force the Party and the government to surrender. They ignored the life and safety of the hunger-striking students and, in order to obtain the so-called intervention of international organizations, even drove out the rescue personnel of the Red Cross Society of China. They also organized the so-called "patrol team" and set up "patrol lines" to patrol and guard around the hunger-striking students, strictly forbidding any hunger-striking students, even those whose lives were already in danger, from withdrawing from the hunger strike. All of these, except proving that they treated the hunger-striking students as "hostages" and blackmailed the Party and the government with their lives, can no longer be explained in any other way.

Q: If the leaders of the Party and the government had talked to the students earlier, would it not have led to such a bad result?

A: This question has already been answered by the facts. The Party and the government, in order to suppress the student movement and stop the turmoil, have done a lot of work and made arduous efforts, maintaining an extremely tolerant and restrained attitude for a long time. What we have done and the tolerant and restrained attitude we have taken can be said to be as thorough as possible, reaching a level that the government of any other country in the world would find difficult to achieve. On this point, international public opinion has also evaluated it in this way for a considerable period of time. In the process of the student movement developing into turmoil, many leaders of the country, including Li Peng, had dialogues with students many times. I and other responsible comrades of many departments also participated in dialogues with students many times. Even until the eve of the riot, the Information Office of the Central Committee and the Information Office of the State Council were still maintaining contact channels with the "High Autonomous Federation." However, the situation still developed step by step into a riot. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, this turmoil is the result of the combination of the international climate and China's own climate, and it is inevitable, sooner or later, and not subject to the will of people.

To explain this, I will point out two facts to young friends here.

First, the heads of the "High Autonomous Federation" have never had the intention of dialogue. A large number of factual situations have shown this. On April 18, Wang Dan and others first requested a dialogue with the responsible comrades of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and later they said that the representatives of the National People's Congress could also come out for a dialogue. However, after the General Office of the National People's Congress agreed to their request, they again said they would not have a dialogue and turned to request that the representatives of the National People's Congress accept their petition book in public at the East Gate of the Great Hall of the People, saying that as long as the petition book was accepted, there would be no problem. However, what was the result? The result was that after accepting their petition book for only 3 hours, more than 2,000 people immediately rushed to the New China Gate, the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The situation on May 13 was also like this. The Information Office of the Central Committee, the State Council, and the National People's Congress accepted the request for a dialogue from some heads of the "High Autonomous Federation" in the morning and notified them of the decision to have a dialogue with the students on the 15th. The heads of the "High Autonomous Federation" agreed on the one hand, but on the other hand, they accused the government of having no intention of dialogue. A few hours after receiving the notice of the dialogue, they issued the "Hunger Strike Declaration" they had prepared in advance and began the hunger strike. All of this fully shows that the heads of the "High Autonomous Federation" did not want a real dialogue. They just used the request for a dialogue as an excuse to continuously expand the situation.

Second, the preconditions and demands proposed by the heads of the "High Autonomous Federation" for the dialogue determined that the dialogue would not have any results and could not solve any problems. In the petition book submitted on May 2, they clearly stated that the government's dialogue with students must exclude legal student organizations and could only dialogue with their representatives. Furthermore, the dialogue must be attended by leaders at the level of Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. Each dialogue must also be conducted by both sides alternately designating the time and place, directly conducting on-site television broadcasts, issuing a joint statement, and signing it together. This is not a "dialogue" of communicating information, increasing understanding, and equal consultation, but a posture of political negotiation. At that time, many comrades pointed out that the so-called "dialogue" conditions proposed by the illegal student organization to the Party and the government were actually negotiation conditions, and even more stringent than the conditions imposed by the victorious country on the defeated country. Their purpose was to force the government not only to recognize that they were the only legal student organization but also to recognize that they were a political force equal to the government. This is obviously unacceptable to us. If we had accepted it, they would have further openly organized opposition parties in China, organized opposition parties, and demanded the implementation of multi-party rotation in power. In that case, the situation would not only not be suppressed, but it would definitely be further expanded, and then there would truly be no peace for the country and the people.

Q: If the martial law troops did not enter the city, would it not have developed into a riot?

A: As I said before, the occurrence of this turmoil and riot is the inevitable result of the long-term infiltration and subversion activities of hostile forces abroad, the long-term prevalence of bourgeois liberalization in China, and the fact that some people within the Party, including some leaders, sympathize with and support the liberalization trend, and the four cardinal principles are not consistently and effectively adhered to. A few counter-revolutionary conspirators want to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and overthrow our socialist People's Republic. This is their purpose for inciting turmoil and even riot. They will not give up until their goal is achieved. If the People's Liberation Army does not enter the city, they will long occupy the political center of the people of the whole country, Tiananmen Square, and create incidents endlessly, continuously expanding the turmoil to the whole country until they achieve their goal of overthrowing the people's government that we have legally elected. They blackmail students to persist in hunger strikes and sit-ins, sometimes erecting the so-called "Statue of Liberty" on Tiananmen Square, and sometimes organizing the so-called limited hunger strike of the intellectuals. They also gathered a few hooligans from Beijing and other places, organizing the so-called "Volunteer Army," "Death Squad," "Flying Tiger Corps," and so on, trying to use violence to overthrow the people's government, organize their so-called new government, and brutally suppress the broad cadres and masses who are loyal to the Party and the people's cause. Even an accidental car accident, they would use it to create rumors, deceive the masses, and try to organize the so-called "funeral procession," igniting the fire of riot. If martial law had not been imposed on part of Beijing early on, and the People's Liberation Army had not entered the city to form a deterrent force, the counter-revolutionary riot might have evolved from incidents such as the attack on the New China Gate into reality. The facts have proven that only the People's Liberation Army smashed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, and the situation in the country has stabilized, and other places have not seen new disturbances. Some young friends also asked, if Beijing did not use the People's Liberation Army, absolutely avoid bloodshed, and rely on the broad workers and other sectors of the society to organize forces to stop the turmoil and maintain order, like Shanghai and Tianjin, would this be better than using the People's Liberation Army? It should be said that such a wish is benevolent, but it is also a completely unrealistic and naive fantasy that is divorced from the actual situation at that time. If martial law had not been imposed on part of Beijing, the People's Liberation Army had not entered the city, and decisive measures had not been taken, the turmoil and even the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing could not have been suppressed, the situation in the country could not have been quickly stabilized, and the measures taken in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places would also not have been effective. This is the true actual situation and the inevitable logic of the development of the event.

Q: The government had previously expressed that it would not settle accounts with the students after the turmoil. Why are students being arrested now?

A: After suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, for those who incited, planned, and directed the turmoil behind the scenes and in front of the scenes, for those who conspired with foreign anti-China forces to overthrow the Communist Party and subvert our socialist system in violation of the Constitution and laws, for those who wantonly beat, smash, loot, burn, and kill, seriously violating criminal laws, including some leaders of illegal student organizations who committed various crimes, we indeed arrested a batch of them. This is necessary to thoroughly suppress the riot, stabilize the situation in the country, and consolidate the People's Republic of socialism, to defend the fundamental interests of the people, and it is unavoidable. For these people, we will proceed with the trial and punishment according to the facts and the law. This is fundamentally different from the so-called "arresting students." That is to say, the concept of "arresting students" does not exist.

As for those who participated in marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes, and even those who had overzealous and wrong words and deeds, the Party and the government have repeatedly said that our policy is tolerant and will not pursue them. Of course, students should also consciously study, reflect deeply, and seriously summarize experiences and lessons. For the many lawless acts of students in the student movement and even the turmoil, we do not approve of them, and sometimes we have to take necessary measures to stop them in order to maintain the overall situation. However, we also know that their mistakes, in addition to their own reasons, are also related to our neglect of the education of young people and other problems in our work. An important task we should do in the future is to work with the broad student body to improve our understanding, further solve the problems in our progress, and continue to promote our reform, opening up, and construction.

Q: The great "April Fifth" movement, which was once defined as a counter-revolutionary activity, will this event be rehabilitated after this incident?

A: The "April Fifth" movement in 1976 is completely incomparable with this turmoil and even riot. The nature of the "April Fifth" movement was to oppose the "Gang of Four" and their ultra-left line, and to support the correct line represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This turmoil is against the Communist Party and the people's government, against the four cardinal principles, and is a bourgeois liberalization, aiming to establish an anti-communist and anti-socialist republic that is completely dependent on Western powers. The result of the "April Fifth" movement created conditions for the smashing of the "Gang of Four" and the subsequent reform and development of our country, promoting historical progress. This turmoil, however, caused bloody incidents, brought about huge political and economic losses, and hindered the smooth progress of China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. Therefore, the "April Fifth" movement was quickly rehabilitated as a patriotic movement, while this turmoil will absolutely not be rehabilitated, that is, any attempt to "reverse the case" will not succeed. Unless the Communist Party of China is really overthrown, and the socialist system is really overthrown in China, a few people with counter-revolutionary thoughts will not die and may realize their plot to "reverse the case." I think that for all Communist Party members and all the people of China, this is absolutely unacceptable.

    如何看待平暴后的一些思想问题
    ——袁木答青年朋友问
    本报讯　《中国青年》杂志第九期刊登了国务院发言人袁木答青年朋友问，回答了一些青年朋友提出的思想上的一些问题，全文如下：
    问：我们反对腐败，反对官倒，去游行示威，是出于爱国，推进民主，为什么不能说是爱国民主运动，反而是动乱呢？
    答：我们完全能够理解年轻人的心情。就前个时期参加游行、示威、静坐、绝食等活动的绝大多数青年学生来说，他们怀着满腔热情，要求促进民主，深化改革，反对贪污，惩治腐败，主观愿望是好的。对于这一点，我想，党和政府过去是这样认为的，现在还是这样认为的。但是，当着由学潮演变为动乱，由动乱发展成为反革命暴乱的真相已经大白于天下的时候，至今还有一些青年朋友这样认识问题和提出问题，在思想上、感情上还转不过弯来，这就不能不令人深切地感到：通过事实，动员和组织年轻朋友们进行自我教育，深刻反思，总结经验教训，这个任务的确还是繁重的。
    我与你们相比，当然有许多不足之处，但也可能有一点优势，这就是对我国历史和现状的了解会比你们多一些。记得4月29日我们受国务院委托第一次与青年学生对话之前，曾经研究了许多材料，找了一些大学生谈话，作了充分的准备。当时，我们就感到事情的确很不简单。大量的事实证明，这场风波从一开始，就有极少数人利用学潮，制造事端，扩大事态，想从中达到他们在社会安定的条件下不可能达到的目的。这极少数人中，多是躲在背后出谋划策的“长胡子”的人，即那些长期坚持资产阶级自由化观点和搞政治阴谋的人，也有一些在前台指挥的有种种不同野心的学生头头。我们在对话中曾经一再提醒同学们警惕这种情况，并且诚恳地告诉同学们自觉地同极少数别有用心的人划清界限，而划清界限的最好方法，就是立即停止违法的游行示威，迅速回校复课，有问题通过正常的民主和法制轨道来解决。我们的提醒和告诫，可能引起了一些人的警觉，但当时很多人甚至大多数人并不以为然。今天，事情的发展已经提供了充分的材料。我建议大家平心静气地、全面地看一看有关材料，相信你们在获得正确的、全面的信息以后，是会逐步转变观点的。无论如何，千万不要报纸不读，电视不看，只凭感情用事。这对国家对自己都没有好处。在这里，别的我就不多说了，只提出两个观点，供你们反思时参考。
    第一，一个历史事件的性质，不是由参加者的主观愿望来决定的，而是由事件的政治纲领，它的客观发展进程，它的作用和它的结果来决定的。当年的“大跃进”，你们能说广大参加者的愿望不好吗？不能。想以最快的速度，最短的时间，发展我们的经济，超英赶美，好得很嘛！但是，历史的实践证明，客观效果并不好，它违反了客观规律，“大跃进”导致了“大跃退”，使国民经济遭到了严重的破坏。再说文化大革命，广大群众当年参加运动的动机是什么？最后运动的性质和他们的动机是否一致？恐怕不一致吧！十年文革成为十年“动乱”，难道不是领导者错误发动，以错误的理论为指导，再加上反革命集团加以利用的结果吗！
    第二，大多数人的良好愿望被极少数用心险恶的人引入歧途不是不可能的。这在中外历史上，都不乏其例。德国人民历来是以理性著称的，但他们的爱国热情当年照样曾经为希特勒所利用，为法西斯主义所利用，以致酿成了世界范围的悲剧。这次的事件从不同的方面重演了历史的悲剧：广大群众的爱国热情被极少数人利用，引发了动乱和暴乱。大多数青年学生，并没有能够使事情按照他们的良好愿望发展，而是自觉不自觉地使事情发展到了他们愿望的反面。
    从根本上说，要正确认识这场风波，需要树立辩证唯物主义的历史观，需要确立忠诚于社会主义、共产主义的人生观，需要有坚定、正确的政治立场。遗憾或者说可惜的是，这些年来，对青年人进行正确的世界观、人生观和政治立场的教育太少了，这也可以说是我们应该吸取的一条重要的经验教训吧！
    问：极少数人能操纵那么多大学生参加学潮，进而挑起动乱和暴乱，这说明了什么？
    答：这个问题提得好。在平息暴乱以后，我们要冷静地回顾过去，思考未来，总结经验教训，避免酿成新的动乱，就要认真地考虑一下这个问题。
    在5月3日的中外记者招待会上，我曾经说过：“极少数人能够挑起动乱，的确存在着深刻的经济的、政治的、社会的、思想的原因，情况是复杂的。”我现在还是这个看法。
    应该看到，在过去十年的改革开放中，在社会主义现代化建设中，我们国家的面貌发生了举世公认的深刻变化，取得了前所未有的重大成绩，但工作中也的确存在着不少的缺点和失误。比如：经济过热，出现了比较明显的通货膨胀；社会主义有计划商品经济的新秩序尚未建立健全，产生了某些官倒和社会分配不公问题；党的领导、党的建设和思想政治工作被淡化了，削弱了；在一些党员和干部中滋生了腐败现象；等等。这些缺点和失误引起了群众的普遍不满。但是，群众中尽管存在着这样那样的程度不等的不满情绪，而从根本上说，人民拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义，这是中国最基本的客观事实。与此相反，极少数反革命阴谋分子制造动乱乃至暴乱的目的，就是要推翻共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的人民共和国。他们为了实现自己的阴谋目的，往往把真实的企图掩盖起来，而把作为“陪衬”的反官倒、反腐败等口号叫得震天价响，这就在广大群众特别是青年学生中起到了很大的欺骗作用。在这次动乱乃至暴乱中，有那么多的人被卷入，许多人甚至明明已被坏人利用而长期不能觉悟，这不能不说是一条重要的原因。
    特别应该指出的是，这次从动乱到暴乱，自始至终都有国外敌对势力的插手。国际垄断资产阶级亡我之心不死，对我展开了猖狂的联合进攻。他们为颠覆中国共产党的领导，为策动我国社会主义的和平演变，利用我们实行改革开放的机会，处心积虑，不惜工本，进行了长期的思想、政治渗透。国内极少数长期坚持资产阶级自由化的人，奴颜婢膝，卖国求荣，同这种国际气候相适应，内外联手，相互勾结，进行了长期的反党反社会主义的思想准备、舆论准备和组织准备。学潮一开始，极少数人精心策划，先后成立了“高自联”、“工自联”等非法组织。他们利用我们工作中的某些失误，利用人民中产生的某些不满情绪，利用我们在经济上遇到的暂时困难，再加上党内个别领导人的包庇和支持，制造谣言，煽动群众，蛊惑人心，终于越闹越大，越闹越凶，使局势发展到了益发难以收拾的地步。
    痛定思痛，要避免今后再次发生类似风波，党和政府与青年朋友们都要付出艰苦的努力。概括起来说，我认为至少有这样几点教训是我们长期应该吸取的：一、在总的世界形势由紧张趋于缓和的条件下，国际垄断资产阶级对社会主义实行和平演变的根本战略并没有改变，对此我们决不能丧失警惕；二、在国内剥削阶级和剥削制度已经消灭的条件下，一定范围内的阶级斗争仍然存在，有时还会很激烈，这次动乱和暴乱就是阶级斗争激化的集中表现。对此，我们也不能忘记；三、四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，两者要相互结合，长期不懈地、始终一贯地加以坚持，决不能一手软一手硬，决不能有所偏废；四、党的核心领导作用一定要加强，思想政治工作一定要加强；五、社会主义民主和法制建设要继续加强，而且一定要把两者很好地统一起来。总之，一方面要端正我们的思想，坚持四项基本原则，长期反对资产阶级自由化，坚决维护安定的社会政治环境，一方面要大大改进我们的工作，消除腐败，清除官倒，解决好社会分配不公的问题，为社会主义有计划商品经济的健康发展，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而长期奋斗。
    问：学生绝食是自愿的，怎么能成为少数人的“人质”呢？
    答：据我所知，学生参加绝食的情况并不都是一样的。从形式上看，某些同学参加绝食是“自愿”的，但实际上他们是在思想上受到了某些坏人的利用和受到了某些谣言蛊惑的结果；有些同学参加绝食，是在当时的环境、当时的气氛下，在错误舆论导向的影响下，觉得不去不好才硬着头皮去参加的；还有一些参加绝食同学，一开始是情愿的，中途后悔了，但又受到所谓种种错误“声援”的迷惑，被逼向绝路，欲罢而不能。当然，在绝食学生看来，如果说有人直接强迫他们绝食，说他们已被别人利用来作为“人质”，他们是难以接受的。对这一点，当然也是可以理解的。但是，如果从动乱组织者和策划者的丑恶行径来看，问题就是非常清楚的了。“高自联”的头头王丹就曾经直截了当地说过：“选在5月13日开始绝食，正好可以借戈尔巴乔夫访华压他们。”他在这里所说的“他们”，指的就是我们的党，就是我们的人民政府。非法学生组织的头头们策动同学们绝食，目的就是以党为敌，以人民政府为敌，以对敌斗争的手段，以同学们的生命作赌注，甚至不惜损害党和国家的国际声誉，以此来要挟党和政府接受他们挑起动乱的政治条件。这种情形，当时已经暴露无遗，难道现在还能不认识清楚吗？在绝食开始后，他们曾经利用各种机会制造种种谣言，煽动群众，大造舆论，妄图迫使党和政府就范。他们置绝食学生的生命安危于度外，为了取得国际组织的所谓干预，竟然将我红十字会的救护人员赶出天安门广场。他们还曾经组织起所谓“纠察队”，设立“纠察线”，在绝食学生周围巡逻放哨，严禁任何绝食学生甚至生命已经垂危的学生退出绝食。所有这些，除了证明他们是把绝食学生当成“人质”，以死相逼，以同学们的生命来要挟党和政府以外，再也不能得出别的解释了。
    问：假如党和政府领导人早一点与学生对话，是否不会导致后来这样的恶果？
    答：这个问题，早就由事实作出了回答。党和政府为了平息学潮，制止动乱，曾经作了大量的工作，付出了艰苦的努力，长期采取了极其宽容、极其克制的态度。我们所做的工作，我们所采取的宽容、克制态度，可以说是仁至义尽，达到了世界上任何一个国家的政府都难以做到、难以采取的程度。关于这一点，相当一个时期的国际舆论也是这样评价的。在学潮到动乱的发展过程中，李鹏同志等国家的许多领导人曾经同学生进行过多次对话，我本人和其他许多部门负责同志也曾经多次参加过同学生的对话。甚至直到暴乱发生的前夕，我们中央办公厅、国务院办公厅的信访局都还与“高自联”保持着联系渠道。但是，事情仍然一步步地发展到了暴乱。正如邓小平同志所指出的，这场风波，是国际大气候同中国自己的小气候相结合的结果，是必然要来的，迟早要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。
    为了说明这一点，我这里再给青年朋友们指出两点事实。
    首先，“高自联”头头们是从来没有对话诚意的，大量的事实情况表明了这一点。4月18日那一天，王丹等人首次要求同全国人大常委会负责同志对话，后来他们又表示人大常委委员出来对话也可以。而当全国人大办公厅同意了他们的要求之后，他们又提出不对话了，转而要求人大代表在人民大会堂东门外当众接受他们的请愿书，并且说只要接了请愿书就什么事也没有了。但是，结果怎样呢？结果是接了他们的请愿书才3个小时，马上就发生了2000多人冲击党中央、国务院所在地新华门的事件。5月13日的情况也是这样。党中央、国务院和人大办公厅的信访局在上午接受了“高自联”一些头头提出的对话要求，并通知他们决定于15日同学生对话。“高自联”的头头一方面表示同意，一方面又指责政府没有对话诚意，在接到对话通知后的几个小时就发表了早就准备好的“绝食宣言”，开始了绝食。这些都充分表明，“高自联”的头头并不是要真正的对话，他们只不过是以要求对话为由头，以此来不断地扩大事态而已。
    第二，“高自联”的头头为对话提出的先决条件和要求，注定了对话不会有什么结果，更不可能解决什么问题。他们在5月2日递交的请愿书就明确提出，政府与学生对话，要把合法的学生组织排除在外，只能与他们的代表对话，并且必须有党中央常委以上、国务院副总理以上、人大副委员长以上的领导人参加，每次对话还必须由双方轮流指定时间、地点，直接进行现场电视转播，出具联合公告，由双方共同签字。这哪里是什么下情上达、上情下达、沟通情况、增进理解、平等协商的“对话”，完全是一副要同党和政府进行政治谈判的架式。当时就有许多同志指出，非法学生组织向党和政府提出的所谓“对话”实际是谈判的条件，甚至比战胜国向战败国提出的条件还要苛刻。其目的就是要强迫政府不仅承认他们才是唯一合法的学生组织，而且承认他们是同政府平起平坐的政治力量。这显然是我们不能接受的。如果接受了，他们就一定会在中国进一步公开组织反对派，组织反对党，要求实行多党轮流执政。那样的话，事态就不仅不能平息，而且肯定将进一步扩大，那就真正的国无宁日，民无宁日了。
    问：戒严部队不进城，是否不会发展成暴乱？
    答：我在前面已经说过，这次动乱和暴乱的发生，是国际上的敌对势力长期对我国进行渗透和颠覆活动，国内资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥，我们党内一些人甚至个别领导人同情和支持自由化思潮，坚持四项基本原则不一贯不得力的必然结果。极少数反革命阴谋分子妄想推翻共产党的领导，颠覆我们的社会主义人民共和国，这是他们策动动乱乃至暴乱的目的。不达目的，他们是决不会善罢甘休的。解放军不进城，他们就会长期占据全国人民的政治中心天安门广场，没完没了地制造事端，不断地把动乱扩大到全国，直至阴谋推翻我们经过合法选举产生的人民政府。他们要挟学生坚持绝食、静坐，一会儿在天安门广场树立所谓“自由女神”像，一会儿又搞知识界的所谓有限绝食。他们还拼凑北京的和各地流窜来的极少数地痞流氓，组织所谓的“义勇军”、“敢死队”、“飞虎队”等等，妄图用暴力推翻人民政府，组织他们的所谓新政府，疯狂镇压忠诚于党和人民事业的广大干部和群众。一起偶然的车祸，他们也要用来制造谣言，蛊惑群众，妄想组织所谓的“抬棺大游行”，燃起暴乱之火。如果不是早就实行了北京部分地区的戒严，形成了解放军大兵压境的威慑力量，恐怕反革命暴乱早就由冲击新华门等事件演变为现实了。事实证明，只有人民解放军一举粉碎了北京的反革命暴乱，全国的局势才稳定下来，各地也才没有出现新的骚乱。有些青年朋友还提出，如果北京不动用解放军，绝对避免流血，也像上海、天津那样依靠广大工人等各界群众组织起制止动乱、维护秩序的社会力量，这样做是不是比动用解放军更好一些呢？应该说，这样的愿望是善良的，但也是完全脱离当时实际情况的天真的幻想。如果北京部分地区不戒严，解放军不进城，不采取断然措施，北京的动乱乃至反革命暴乱根本平息不了，全国局势无法迅速稳定，上海、天津等地采取的措施也难以奏效，这才是真正的实际情况和事件发展的必然逻辑。
    问：政府曾表示过对学生不秋后算帐，现在为什么又抓学生？
    答：平息反革命暴乱以后，对那些在幕前幕后煽动、策划和指挥动乱的人，对那些违反宪法、法律勾结国外反华势力蓄谋打倒共产党、颠覆我国社会主义制度的人，对那些肆意打砸抢烧杀、严重触犯刑律的人，其中也包括极少数犯有种种罪行的非法学生组织的头头，我们的确抓了一批。这是彻底平息暴乱，稳定全国局势，巩固社会主义人民共和国的需要，是捍卫人民根本利益的需要，是非这样做不可的。对于这些人，我们将以事实为依据，以法律为准绳，依法进行审理和处置。这同所谓的“抓学生”，是根本不同的两回事。也就是说，“抓学生”这个概念是根本不存在的。
    至于对那些参加过游行、示威、静坐、绝食的学生，甚至对有过过激的和错误言行的学生，党和政府曾经多次讲过，我们的政策是宽容的，是不会追究的。当然，同学们也应该通过自觉的学习，进行深刻的反思，认真地总结经验教训。对于同学们在学潮乃至动乱中的许多违反法制的做法，我们是不赞成的，有时候为了维护大局我们也是不得不采取必要的措施来加以制止的。但是我们也知道，他们所犯的错误，除了他们自身的原因以外，也是同我们忽视了对青年的教育和其它工作中存在的一些问题分不开的。我们今后应该做的事情，其中重要的一项，就是和广大同学们一道，共同努力，提高认识，进一步解决好前进中存在的问题，把我们的改革开放和建设事业继续推向前进。
    问：伟大的“四五”运动，当年也曾被定为反革命活动，这次事件以后是否也可能要平反？
    答：1976年的“四五”运动，同这次动乱乃至暴乱是完全不能相提并论的。“四五”运动的性质是反对“四人帮”及其极左路线，拥护以邓小平同志为代表的正确路线，这次风波反对的是共产党和人民政府，反对的是四项基本原则，搞的是资产阶级自由化，妄想建立的是反共反社会主义的，完全附庸于西方大国的资产阶级共和国。“四五”运动的结果为粉碎“四人帮”及其以后我国的改革和发展创造了条件，推动了历史的进步，这次风波却造成了流血事件，带来了政治上和经济上的巨大损失，阻碍了我国改革开放和经济建设的顺利进行。因此，“四五”运动作为爱国运动很快得到平反，而这次风波绝对不可能平反，也就是说任何妄想“翻案”的企图都是不可能得逞的。除非中国共产党真的被打倒，除非社会主义制度真的在中国被颠覆，极少数反革命之心不死的人才有可能实现他们妄想“翻案”的阴谋目的。我想，这对于全体共产党员和全中国人民来说，都是绝对不会答应的。
