The national conference on poverty alleviation in ethnic minority regions held its morning session today, during which reports were presented on the efforts made by central departments in recent years to support the economic and cultural development of ethnic minority regions.

The Ministry of Agriculture, noting that many of China's poverty-stricken areas are ethnic minority autonomous regions or areas where ethnic minorities reside and that a significant number of ethnic minority people have not yet solved their food and clothing problems, has focused on promoting the use of plastic film for corn cultivation in over 200 key poverty-stricken counties nationwide. This initiative is part of the "Food Security Program." Among the 200-plus counties involved in the "Food Security Program," half are ethnic minority autonomous regions or areas where ethnic minorities reside. In these counties, 2.15 million mu (approximately 143,333 hectares) of corn have been covered with plastic film. Currently, the corn in the project areas is growing well and is expected to yield a bumper harvest. To help ethnic minority poverty-stricken regions achieve prosperity as soon as possible, the Ministry of Agriculture has also designated the Wuling Mountains area as a poverty alleviation contact point, organizing ministry staff to directly participate in the economic development of ethnic minority poverty-stricken regions. In terms of agricultural development funds and materials, the Ministry of Agriculture has given preferential treatment and assistance to ethnic minority poverty-stricken regions. Over the past four years, the ministry has solved the problem of 22,000 tons of fertilizer, 3,000 tons of steel, 1,000 cubic meters of timber, 20,000 tons of cement, 1,500 tons of diesel, more than 60 vehicles of various types, and more than 30 plastic greenhouses for the Wuling Mountains area alone.

From 1986 to 1989, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources carried out 2,015 geological work projects in poverty-stricken regions, investing 480 million yuan in geological exploration fees, and submitting 691 geological reports, of which about 50% have been developed and utilized. Since 1987, they have conducted geological work in 154 projects across 141 ethnic minority poverty-stricken counties, investing 33.9 million yuan in special poverty alleviation funds. Since 1988, they have evaluated 234 mineral deposits in 88 of these poverty-stricken counties, of which about 70% have been developed and utilized, generating significant economic benefits.

Since 1981, the Agricultural Bank of China has offered preferential low-interest loans to ethnic trade and ethnic product manufacturing enterprises. In 1985, it provided low-interest loans for farmers' housing in parts of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province. In 1988, it offered special subsidized loans for poverty alleviation in pastoral areas for 27 counties in six provinces and regions, including Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. In terms of loan terms, amounts, and the proportion of self-raised funds, they have relaxed the conditions, making the loan conditions for ethnic minority regions relatively more favorable than other regions. According to statistics from eight ethnic minority regions, the outstanding agricultural loans in these regions were 1.46 billion yuan in 1981, while the current outstanding agricultural loans are 8.8 billion yuan, an increase of fivefold.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have been actively supporting the work in ethnic minority regions based on the principles of "seeking truth from facts, doing one's best, filling in the gaps, and emphasizing practical results."

In recent years, they have also provided management and technical services to enterprises in ethnic minority regions, promoting the development of the local commodity economy.

    中央有关部委多方努力
    帮助民族地区脱贫致富
    温饱工程地质找矿等扶植措施收效明显
    新华社北京9月21日电  （通讯员李建辉、记者格来）全国少数民族地区扶贫工作会议今天上午进行大会发言，介绍了中央有关部委近年来扶持帮助少数民族地区发展经济、文化事业的情况。
    农业部根据我国的贫困地区大多是少数民族自治地方或民族聚居区，有相当数量的少数民族群众没有解决温饱问题等情况，重点在全国贫困地区大力推广地膜覆盖玉米栽培技术，组织实施
  “温饱工程”。在实施“温饱工程”的200多个重点贫困县中，有一半是少数民族自治地方或民族聚居区，这些县（旗）中推广地膜玉米215万亩。目前，“温饱工程”项目区玉米长势喜人，可望获得丰收。为帮助少数民族贫困地区尽快脱贫致富，农业部还把武陵山区作为扶贫联系点，组织机关干部直接参与少数民族贫困地区的经济开发工作。农业部在农业发展资金和物资上，对少数民族贫困地区尽可能予以照顾和帮助。4年来，仅为武陵山区联系解决化肥2.2万吨、钢材3000多吨、木材1000多立方米，水泥2万吨、柴油1500多吨、各种汽车60多辆、塑料大棚30多个等。
    地矿部自1986—1989年四年间，在贫困地区开展地质工作项目总数达2015项，投入地勘费4.8亿多元，提交各种地质报告691份，其中有50％左右已得到开发利用。1987年以来，他们在141个少数民族贫困县开展地质工作154项，投入专项扶贫资金3390万元。1988年以来，已为这些贫困县中的88个县（旗）评价了234处矿产地，其中约有70％已被开发利用并产生显著经济效益。
    中国农业银行自1981年起对民族贸易、民族用品生产企业的贷款实行了优惠的低利率；1985年对吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的部分地方开办了低利率的农民建房贷款；1988年对内蒙古、新疆6个省区的27个县（旗）开办了牧区扶贫专项贴息贷款。在贷款中，他们还对贷款期限、额度、自有资金比例等方面实行了松动，从而使少数民族地区的贷款条件相对优惠于其他地区。据八个少数民族地区统计，1981年这些地区的农贷余额为14.6亿元，而目前的农贷余额为88亿元，增长了5倍。
    民建中央、全国工商联本着“实事求是，尽力而为，拾遗补缺，讲求实效”的原则，积极开展支援少数民族地区的工作。
    近年来，他们还为少数民族地区企业提供管理和技术服务，促进了当地商品经济的发展。
