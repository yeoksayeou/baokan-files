	Shooting is not a strong suit for Jiangxi. In the past, the championship rarely fell to them. This time, even some experts at the Youth Games did not expect them to win a gold medal. However, with each gunshot, Jiangxi's Cai Yueqing demonstrated superior skills, winning the women's air pistol gold medal on the first day of the competition and changing people's perceptions.

	During the competition, Cai Yueqing showed off her excellent shooting skills, as well as her strong physical and mental qualities, making people very convinced.

	In just a few years, how did a weak point become a strong point? Jiangxi Provincial Sports Commission Director Jiang Zuozhou saw from the growth of Olympic champion Xu Yanmei that the cultivation of reserve forces must concentrate human, financial, and material resources, and put in great effort. In recent years, Jiangxi has been quietly working hard, focusing on water sports, shooting, badminton, and a few other promising projects, cultivating top talents. Hard work pays off. Xu Yanmei won the Olympic diving gold medal, and there is also a group of athletes who have won championships in international competitions. Now, shooting talents have emerged, and the results are gratifying.

	Cai Yueqing's coach, Zhang Mingxian, said that Jiangxi focuses on building a strong foundation for reserve forces. Young athletes must be able to endure hardship, follow discipline, and have ideals. Without these, even the best techniques cannot be fully utilized. Their athletes can both train and compete. Jiangxi has a weak economic foundation, and they especially emphasize the need to bring glory to the old revolutionary base areas, using outstanding sports achievements to boost the spirits of the people of the entire province.

	Another key point is to focus on basic training, practicing diligently. The Jiangxi shooting team arranges training in the morning, afternoon, and evening. To catch up with and surpass others, one must spend more time, and there is no shortcut. Because they practice more, their basic skills and tactics are solid, and the athletes are not afraid of competition. Today, their solid work has yielded fruitful results.

    江西何以能出好射手
    ——从蔡烨清夺得女子气手枪金牌谈起
    射击并非江西的强项，过去桂冠很少落到他们头上。这次青运会包括一些行家在内都未预见他们会拿金牌。可是随着声声枪响，江西姑娘蔡烨清技压群芳，在开赛的第一天就夺得女子气手枪金牌，改变了人们的看法。
    在比赛中，蔡烨清显示出枪法过硬、身体和心理素质过硬的优势，使人们十分信服。
    在短短几年时间里，一个弱项为何能变成强项？省体委主任姜佐周从奥运会冠军许艳梅的成长中看到，对于后备力量的培养一定要集中人力、财力、物力，下大力气抓。这几年江西暗暗使劲，抓水上、射击、羽毛球等几个很有希望的项目，培养一流尖子。功夫不负有心人，许艳梅夺得奥运会跳水金牌，还有一批选手在国际大赛中夺魁，现在又冒出射击尖子，成绩喜人。
    蔡烨清的教练张明宪说，江西抓后备力量先打思想基础。小队员要能吃苦、守纪律、有理想，离开了这些再好的技术也发挥不出来。他们的队员既能训练也能比赛。江西经济基础差，他们特别强调要为老区争光，用体育的优秀成绩，振奋全省人民的精神。
    另一个就是打好基本功训练，百练不厌。江西射击队是上午、下午、晚上都安排训练。要赶上和超过别人，必须多花时间，没有捷径可走。由于他们练得多，所以基本功和技战术都过硬，队员不惧比赛。今天，他们扎扎实实的工作已结下丰硕之果。
