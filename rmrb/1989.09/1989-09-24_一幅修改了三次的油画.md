The National Day ceremony on October 1, 1949, brought tears to the eyes of a painter, Bo Hongwen, who had once taught at the National Art Academy in Beiping.

After three years of preparation, Bo Hongwen began painting "The Founding Ceremony" in 1952. The work was completed the following year and received unanimous praise from the art community as well as the general public. Party and state leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De also highly praised the painting. When the Chinese Revolution Museum, one of Beijing's "Ten Great Buildings," was completed in 1959, this work, which recorded the glorious day of the founding of New China, was collected there. However, this was not the original version completed by the painter in 1953.

Soon after the founding of New China, the "Gao Gang Incident" prompted the painter to make the first modification to "The Founding Ceremony." In this revision, Gao Gang, who was originally depicted standing on the left side of the group of national leaders, was painted over. This revised version of "The Founding Ceremony" was later used as the design for a commemorative stamp for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

Several years passed, and in 1972, when Bo Hongwen was nearing sixty, he was again "commissioned" to make a second modification to "The Founding Ceremony." Artworks could not escape the political misfortunes brought by the Cultural Revolution. This time, Liu Shaoqi was removed from the painting.

It was not until 1979, when the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee reaffirmed the principle of "seeking truth from facts," that "The Founding Ceremony," which had been altered beyond recognition due to historical reasons, was treated fairly and underwent a third "modification." However, this time it was not about removing any of the leaders of New China from the painting, but rather restoring the original appearance of this famous work. Unfortunately, the painter of "The Founding Ceremony," Bo Hongwen, passed away in 1973 and did not participate in or witness the restoration of his work to its original state, which was then rehung in the bright and spacious hall of the Chinese Revolution Museum.

    一幅修改了三次的油画
    1949年10月1日的开国大典，使一位画家的眼睛湿润了，他就是曾执教于国立北平艺专的著名画家董希文。
    董希文经过三个年头的准备，于1952年动笔创作《开国大典》，翌年完成后，不仅得到美术界的一致赞赏，也受到人民群众的好评。党和国家领导人毛泽东、周恩来、朱德观赏之后也不住交口称赞。当1959年北京著名的“十大建筑”之一中国革命历史博物馆落成后，这幅纪录下新中国诞生光辉日子的作品，就收藏在那里。可是这已经不是画家1953年第一次完成的画幅了。
    新中国诞生后不久发生的“高岗事件”，使《开国大典》的作者不得不对它作出修改。在这次修改中，原先站在画幅左侧国家领导人群像里的高岗被涂掉了。修改过的这幅《开国大典》，后来被采用为纪念建国十年大庆而出版的一枚邮票图案。
    十几年过去了，在董希文年近花甲时，1972年又“受命”对《开国大典》作第二次修改。美术作品也逃不脱“文革”带来的政治厄运。这次修改，从画幅上去掉了刘少奇。
    直至1979年，党的十一届三中全会重新确定了“实事求是”的政治路线，由于历史原因而被修改得面目全非的《开国大典》，受到了公正的对待，第三次作出“修改”。不过这次不再是从画幅上涂掉哪一位新中国的领导人了，而是恢复这幅名画的原貌。但是十分可惜，《开国大典》的作者董希文于1973年去世，没能参与和看到他的作品以他的创作原意重新绘制，重新高悬于中国革命历史博物馆明亮宽敞的大厅里。
