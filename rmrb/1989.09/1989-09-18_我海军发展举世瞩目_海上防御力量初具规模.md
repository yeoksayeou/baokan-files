Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 17th.

China's Navy, after 40 years of development, has become a sea defense force with a certain influence and initial scale. Many visiting foreign naval commanders have praised: China's Navy development is globally noteworthy.

Currently, all major combat vessels in service with the Navy, including conventional submarines, nuclear submarines, missile destroyers, missile frigates, missile boats, anti-submarine vessels, minesweepers, and landing ships, are fully domestically produced. The naval aviation force has evolved from a single aircraft type at its inception to a multi-type aviation force and air defense force today, equipped with fighter jets, attack aircraft, bombers, helicopters, reconnaissance aircraft, transport aircraft, seaplanes, anti-submarine aircraft, and patrol aircraft. In terms of quantity, it ranks third in the world, following the United States and the Soviet Union. The naval coastal defense forces have developed from having only coastal artillery to a missile-based coastal defense force today. The marine corps has also grown into a "military within the military," comprising marine infantry, armored infantry, and artillery units.

    据新华社北京9月17日电　（记者黄彩虹）中国海军经过40年的建设，已成为世界上有一定影响的初具规模的海上防御力量。许多来访的外国海军将领称：中国海军发展举世瞩目。
    目前在海军服役的常规潜艇、核潜艇、导弹驱逐舰、导弹护卫舰、导弹艇、猎潜艇、扫雷舰、登陆舰等各类主要作战舰艇全部实现国产化。海军航空兵已由初建时的单一机种，发展成为现在拥有歼击机、强击机、轰炸机、直升机、侦察机、运输机、水上飞机、反潜飞机、巡逻机等多机种的航空兵部队和防空部队，其数量仅次于美国和苏联，在世界各国海军中居第3位；海军岸防部队从当年只有岸炮发展成今天以导弹为主的岸导部队；海军陆战队也发展成拥有陆战步兵、装甲步兵、炮兵等兵种的“军中之军”。
