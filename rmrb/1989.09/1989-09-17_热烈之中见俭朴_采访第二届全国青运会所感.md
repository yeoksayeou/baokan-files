The time to wrap up my reporting in Shenyang is approaching, and the grand and lively scenes of the Second National Youth Games keep replaying in my mind. The warmth of the people of Liaoning is touching. As one delegation wrote on a banner: “Competing in Liaoning, hearts tied to Jincheng.” However, do not forget that the people of Liaoning are very frugal and good at managing finances. In my reporting, I deeply felt this point.

According to the financial department of the organizing committee, this grand event indeed saved a large amount of funds. Just by canceling the opening ceremony's group gymnastics, 3 million yuan was saved. The funds for large-scale activities were also saved by over 300,000 yuan. Additionally, not setting up a presidium and not giving gifts saved a lot of funds.

Moreover, all the cars used by the conference, big and small, were borrowed from various units, and the drivers were volunteering. Some equipment and instruments were also borrowed. They clearly distinguished between borrowing and buying, not buying what could be borrowed, and using substitutes whenever possible.

The conference's staff and reception personnel all volunteered. The cadres and teachers of the municipal party school decorated their campus more beautifully than a garden to welcome athletes from all over the country, and then voluntarily served as waiters. The general manager of Jincheng Hotel, Zhou Ziyuan, worked day and night. His wife said, “Only you are a Communist Party member.” He replied, “All of us are enthusiastic about the Second Youth Games.” It is this selfless dedication that made the Second Youth Games both frugal and lively.

Furthermore, many individual business owners also volunteered to repair shoes and bags for athletes and coaches, which is very touching.

The facts prove that it is precisely the spirit of thrift and selfless dedication that made the Second National Youth Games so lively, grand, successful, and frugal.

　　热烈之中见俭朴
　　——采访第二届全国青运会所感
    马上要结束在沈阳的采访了，第二届全国青运会热烈隆重的盛况，仍不断在脑中浮现。辽宁人的热心肠让人感动，正像一个代表团在锦旗上所写的那样：“逐鹿辽沈，情牵金城”。但是，别忘了辽宁人十分节俭，善于精打细算，热烈之中见俭朴。在采访中，记者深切地感到这一点。
    据组委会财务部门同志介绍，这次盛会确实节约了一大笔经费，仅取消开幕式团体操一项，便省出300万元人民币。大型活动经费也省下30多万元。另外不设主席团、不送礼品，又节约了不少经费。
    另外，大会所用的大小轿车，全部是各单位借的，司机也是义务帮忙。一些器材和仪器也是借的。他们把借和买的界线分得一清二楚，能借到的不买，能代替的尽量用。
    大会的工作人员和接待人员都是义务的。市委党校的干部和老师把校园打扮得比花园还美，迎接各地运动员，然后又主动当服务员。金城宾馆总经理周资远白天黑夜连续干。老伴说，“就你一人是共产党”。他说：“我们所有的人都对二青会热心。”就是这种无私的奉献，使二青会办得俭朴而热烈。
    还有，许多个体户这次也义务为运动员、教练员修鞋、修包等，其精神令人感动。
    事实证明，正是有了勤俭干事业的思想和无私奉献的精神，第二届全国青运会才能开得如此热烈、隆重、圆满、俭朴。
