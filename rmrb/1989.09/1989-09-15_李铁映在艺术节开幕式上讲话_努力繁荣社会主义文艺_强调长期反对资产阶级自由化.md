Li Tieying's Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Second China Art Festival

Strive to Prosper Socialist Arts
Emphasize Long-Term Opposition to Bourgeois Liberalization

Comrades and friends,

In this season of refreshing autumn breezes, as the nation celebrates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, and shortly after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the Second China Art Festival has grandly opened! This is a major event in the cultural life of our people and has significant political implications. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to the Second China Art Festival! I extend a warm welcome and sincere thanks to all the artists and art enthusiasts, foreign guests, and overseas compatriots participating in the Second China Art Festival! I pay high tribute to the broad masses of cultural workers who have made contributions to the prosperity of our country's arts!

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country's arts have achieved remarkable results. The broad masses of cultural workers have adhered to the Party's basic line, stood firmly on the deep foundation of national culture, carried forward the fine traditions of revolutionary arts, learned from the excellent achievements of foreign arts, and rapidly developed our country's arts. Two years ago, the First China Art Festival held in Beijing successfully showcased some of these achievements. Today, we are holding the Second China Art Festival to concentrate on displaying the excellent results of recent artistic creation and performance, showcasing the healthy aspects of the cultural life of the masses, further promoting domestic and international cultural exchanges, inspiring the broad masses of cultural workers to create more and better artistic works, and making greater contributions to the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization.

Comrades, our country is in an era of great construction and transformation. The successful convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has won a stable and united social environment for the construction and reform of our country, creating good conditions for the development of our economy, politics, science and technology, and arts. We must continue to persist in the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to ensure the healthy development of the arts. We must continue to firmly adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and strive to further prosper culture and arts. The great practice of building modernization by hundreds of millions of people provides a rich source for artistic creation. The broad masses of cultural workers should closely unite around the Party, strive to provide the people with rich and colorful, healthy and exquisite spiritual food. This is a major task in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and a glorious historical mission for cultural workers. We hope that Party organizations and government departments at all levels, as well as all sectors of society, will further care for and support cultural and artistic work, respect and understand the creative labor of artists. Let us, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, strive to prosper and develop the cause of socialist arts!

I wish the Second China Art Festival a complete success!

Thank you all!
