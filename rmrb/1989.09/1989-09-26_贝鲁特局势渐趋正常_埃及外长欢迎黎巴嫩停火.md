The situation in Beirut is gradually returning to normal. Egyptian Foreign Minister welcomes the ceasefire in Lebanon.

BEIRUT, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Since the Lebanese interim military government chief General Michel Aoun announced on Sept. 23 his acceptance of the Arab League's three-party committee's solution, the situation in Lebanon has shown initial signs of stabilization.

Yesterday was the first day of the ceasefire, and the entire city of Beirut remained calm. The Beirut International Airport, which had been closed for more than half a year, reopened. The blockade on Beirut's port has been lifted, and all roads between the eastern and western parts of the city have been reopened.

Over the past two days, representatives of the Arab League's three-party committee, including Ibrahim, have held repeated consultations with leaders from both Christian and Muslim factions to discuss the implementation of other provisions in the Arab League's three-party committee's plan. According to reports, after the ceasefire in Lebanon, the relevant parties will enter into discussions on political reforms.

Local sources believe that the next phase of resolving Lebanon's political issues will be a true test of the Arab League's three-party committee's efforts. According to the plan of the Arab League's three-party committee, the Lebanese parliament is expected to convene soon in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

CAIRO, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid today welcomed the ceasefire in Lebanon in a statement to the Middle East News Agency.

Meguid said that the ceasefire between the various factions in Lebanon and the reopening of Beirut International Airport signal the country's return to unity, independence, and stability. He noted that the warring factions in Lebanon have recognized the need to resolve domestic issues through political means.

According to reports, under the mediation of the Arab League's three-party committee, the warring factions in Lebanon achieved a ceasefire last Saturday.

    贝鲁特局势渐趋正常
    埃及外长欢迎黎巴嫩停火
    本报大马士革9月25日电  记者吕志星报道：自本月23日黎巴嫩临时军政府首脑奥恩宣布接受阿拉伯联盟3方委员会的解决方案以来，黎巴嫩形势出现了初步稳定。
    昨天是停火的第一天，整个贝鲁特局势平静。关闭了半年多的贝鲁特国际机场已重新开放。贝鲁特港口已解除封锁。贝鲁特东西区各通道也已开放。
    两天来，阿拉伯联盟3方委员会代表伊卜拉希米分别同基督教派和穆斯林教派负责人反复进行磋商，就贯彻阿盟3方委员会方案的其他条款交换意见。据报道，黎巴嫩实现停火后，有关各方将进入有关政治改革的讨论。
    当地人士认为，下一阶段有关黎巴嫩政治问题的解决将是对阿盟3方委员会努力的真正考验。根据阿盟3方委员会的方案，黎巴嫩议会将可能近期内在沙特阿拉伯的吉达开会。
    新华社开罗9月24日电埃及外长马吉德今天向中东通讯社发表谈话，对黎巴嫩实现停火表示欢迎。
    马吉德说，黎巴嫩各派实现停火和重新开放贝鲁特国际机场，预示着这个国家将恢复团结、独立与稳定。他指出，黎巴嫩交战各方都认识到有必要采取政治手段解决国内问题。
    据报道，在阿拉伯联盟调解黎巴嫩危机3方委员会的斡旋下，黎巴嫩交战双方已于上星期六实现停火。
