In Lanzhou, known as the "City of Fruits and Vegetables," there are many excellent varieties of melons. The "Golden Flower Treasure," with its green rind and red flesh, is one of them. Senior agronomist He Rongsu from the City Suburb Seed Company selected and cultivated the new watermelon variety P2 from over 20 hybrid combinations. After much effort, he successfully improved the P2 self-crossing system. In 1988, the selected variety of P2, "Golden Flower Treasure," won first place in the national watermelon variety competition.
