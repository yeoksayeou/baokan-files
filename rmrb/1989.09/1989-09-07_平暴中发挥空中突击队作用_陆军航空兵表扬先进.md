People's Liberation Army Composite Group Army's new member—the Army Aviation Corps—played a significant role as an airborne strike force in quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. The Central Military Commission has commended the Army Aviation Corps. Today, the Army Aviation Corps held a meeting to commend 19 advanced collectives and 131 advanced individuals.

On the day the State Council issued the order to impose martial law in parts of Beijing, the Army Aviation Corps appeared in the skies above Tiananmen Square as the airborne strike force of the martial law troops, distributing leaflets to educate the masses and intimidate the criminals. During the days of stopping the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Army Aviation Corps units resolutely carried out the orders of the Party Central Committee, followed the commands of the Central Military Commission, overcame various difficulties, dispatched dozens of helicopters, flew hundreds of sorties, conducted reconnaissance and liaison, transported wounded soldiers, and supplied military needs, ensuring the smooth execution of tasks by the martial law troops.

The Army Aviation Corps, born out of military reforms, is a highly modernized and mobile new type of troops. Since its establishment, it has fully utilized its advantages to excellently complete tasks such as composite exercises, national defense research, disaster relief, border patrols, and emergency air transport.
