Xinhua News Agency, September 24th.

Sun Chunming, a sewer maintenance worker at the Chongqing Municipal Public Works Maintenance Management Bureau, does not seek personal gain but rather strives for dedication. For the past ten years, he has been working with sewage and filth, "sacrificing his own cleanliness for the cleanliness of thousands of households." He has been named a labor model of Sichuan Province twice.
