The origin of the giant panda's ancestors has long been a mystery in the scientific community. Recent research by Chinese scientists on panda fossils has revealed that the giant panda's ancestors were ancestral bears, and that the giant panda belongs to the bear family rather than the raccoon family.

The giant panda exhibits characteristics of both the bear family and the raccoon family in its external morphology and internal organ structure. Since its naming in 1869, its origin and classification have been subjects of intense academic debate, with no definitive conclusion reached. The primary reason for this is the lack of fossil evidence.

Researchers Qiu Zhanxiang and Qi Guoqin from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Anthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently discovered a small bear-like animal while studying carnivorous fossils from the Lufeng ancient ape site in Yunnan. This animal's tooth structure exhibits characteristics of both the giant panda and the ancestral bear, dating back approximately 8.2 million years. It is the earliest known representative of the giant panda family, and they have named it the "Archaic Panda." This discovery provides direct evidence for resolving the long-standing debate over the origin and classification of the giant panda.

Researcher Huang Wanshan and engineer Ou Yang Lian from the same institute conducted comprehensive analyses on over a thousand giant panda fossil specimens (including skulls, mandibles, teeth, and skeletal remains). Using electron microscopy and other microscopic techniques, they compared the enamel structure of the teeth of the giant panda, red panda, black bear, and ancestral bear. The results indicate that the giant panda originated from the ancestral bear within the bear family, not from the raccoon family.

Professor Pan Wenshi from Peking University and his team used rabbit anti-giant panda immunoglobulin serum to conduct experiments on four closely related animals: the Malayan sun bear, red panda, giant panda, and black bear. The results showed that the giant panda and black bear are closely related. Therefore, he also believes that the giant panda's classification should be within the bear family rather than the raccoon family.

As for which specific ancestral bear the giant panda's ancestors belonged to, further exploration is needed.

### 我国揭开熊猫起源之谜

　　我国揭开熊猫起源之谜
    大熊猫的祖先究竟是什么动物？这个科学之谜正在被揭开。最近，我国科学工作者通过对熊猫化石的宏观和微观研究，证明大熊猫的祖先是祖熊，大熊猫应属熊科而不是浣熊科。
    大熊猫在外部形态和内部器官构造上既有熊科也有浣熊科的特征，因此，关于它的起源和分类，自1869年命名以来，一直是学术界激烈争论的问题，长期以来尚未定论。主要原因是缺乏化石证据。
    中国科学院古脊椎与古人类研究所研究员邱占祥、副研究员祁国琴最近在研究云南禄丰古猿产地食肉类化石时发现，有一种小型熊类动物，其牙齿结构既有熊猫的特征，又有祖熊的特征，地质年代距今约820万年，是目前世界上已知的最早的大熊猫类的代表，他们已将其定名为始熊猫。这一发现，为解决长期争论的大熊猫起源与分类地位的问题提供了直接证据。
    该所副研究员黄万坡、工程师欧阳涟将他们收集的上千件大熊猫化石标本（包括头骨、下颌骨、牙齿及骨架）进行了综合分析研究，特别是通过电子显微镜扫描等微观手段对大熊猫、小熊猫、黑熊以及祖熊的牙齿釉质结构进行了深入的比较研究，结果表明大熊猫起源于熊科中的祖熊而不是浣熊。
    北京大学潘文石教授等应用兔抗大熊猫免疫球蛋白血清，对马来熊、小熊猫、大熊猫、黑熊四种相近动物做了试验，结果发现大熊猫和黑熊接近，亲缘关系极其密切。因此他也认为大熊猫的分类地位应为熊科而不是浣熊科。
    至于大熊猫的祖先究竟是属于那一种祖熊，还有待人们去进一步探索。
