    Court Presidents Appeal: Do Not Give Gifts to Judges
    From 1987 to May of this year, 955 individuals attempted to give gifts or invite judges and police officers from the municipal and county courts of our city to dine with them, offering a total of over 32,000 yuan in cash and goods. However, all these attempts were rejected by the court personnel. Among these individuals, a very small number were attempting to bribe the judges to absolve them of their crimes; the vast majority were expressing their gratitude after winning their lawsuits.

    The presidents of some district and county courts in the city have demanded that every judicial officer must be upright and impartial, and must not accept any form of cash, gifts, or invitations from litigants. They also hope that the general public will refrain from giving gifts or inviting judges and police officers to dine with them.

    To prevent a small number of judicial officers from accepting gifts and invitations, relevant departments in the city have requested that the general public strengthen their supervision of the courts and judicial officers.

    法院院长们呼吁  不要向法官送礼
    1987年至今年5月，有关人员向我市市、县两级法院干警送礼、请吃的达955人次，送的现金和财物达3.2万多元，但都遭到了法院干警的拒绝。这些送礼、请吃的人中，极少数人是企图通过行贿，让法院干警为他们开脱罪责；绝大多数人是打赢了官司，向法院干警表示感谢的。
    市部分县区法院院长要求每一个干警都必须清正廉明，秉公执法，不准以任何形式接收诉讼当事人的现金、礼品和吃请。也希望广大群众再不要向法院干警送礼、请吃了。
    为了防止极少数干警收受礼品和接受吃请，市有关部门请求广大群众加强对法院工作和干警的监督。
