	Good Children Year After Year Tame the Yellow River, "Mother River" Year After Year Calm
	The Yellow River Achieves Great Changes in New China
	The Yellow River Banks Build Grain, Cotton, Energy, and Industrial Bases

	The Yellow River, which has seen the labor of the people along its banks and state investment of hundreds of billions of yuan, has once again safely passed through the autumn floods this year. With this, the 40-year journey of this ten-thousand-mile river has been accompanied by the steps of the People's Republic, achieving the long-held dream of the working people: "When the Yellow River is tamed, the world will be at peace."

	In the five-thousand-year history of the Chinese nation, the Yellow River is known as the "Mother River." Under its nurturing, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor created a brilliant national culture and gave birth to the vast North China Plain. However, the unruly Yellow River has also brought great disasters to the people on both banks.

	Soon after the founding of the People's Republic, the state made the control of the Yellow River an important measure for stabilizing the country. In October 1952, Chairman Mao Zedong made his first trip out of Beijing to personally inspect the Yellow River, issuing the call to "do a good job with the Yellow River." Premier Zhou Enlai presided over numerous meetings on the Yellow River, from strategic planning and decision-making to the layout of major water conservancy projects, he devoted a great deal of effort. In July 1955, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress passed the "Resolution on the Comprehensive Plan for Controlling Yellow River Floods and Developing Yellow River Water Resources." In a time of financial strain, the state invested hundreds of billions of yuan, providing the financial and material foundation for controlling the Yellow River.

	The central government's attention to the Yellow River greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the people along the river to control and develop the Yellow River. The people of Shandong and Henan provinces along the lower reaches of the Yellow River have, over the past 40 years, eliminated 330,000 hidden dangers on the dikes, built and rebuilt more than 5,000 stone embankments, raised and thickened the thousand-mile-long dikes three times, and moved 700 million cubic meters of soil and stone. This is equivalent to building 13 Great Walls and digging two Suez Canals.

	In the main sediment source area of the Yellow River, the Loess Plateau, the people along the river have persisted for decades in planting trees and grass, building check dams, terraced fields, and conducting small watershed management. They have carried out large-scale water and soil conservation work, achieving remarkable results. The most severely affected coarse sand area has effectively treated an area of 100,000 square kilometers. In the past 15 years, an average of 1.8 billion tons of sediment have been reduced annually.

	An official from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission told reporters that from 1911 to 1946, in the 35 years before the founding of the People's Republic, the lower reaches of the Yellow River experienced eight floods of more than 10,000 cubic meters per second, with seven of them breaching and flooding, leaving thousands of villages and towns in ruins. In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, there have been 12 such floods, but not a single one has breached and caused a disaster. In 1958, the largest flood since the founding of the People's Republic occurred in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The Huayuankou section saw a massive flood peak of 22,300 cubic meters per second, with surging muddy waters and towering waves, but the dikes on both banks remained unscathed, and the people along the river lived and worked in peace, creating a miracle in the history of controlling the Yellow River.

	Over the past 40 years, the Yellow River basin has undergone a historic transformation. China's most important grain, cotton, energy, and industrial bases have been established one after another in the Yellow River basin, and it is the Yellow River that provides these bases with abundant water resources. According to statistics, more than 200 irrigation districts of over 50,000 acres each have been built along the Yellow River, expanding the irrigated area from 12 million acres before liberation to 70 million acres. The lower reaches of the Yellow River have built 76 new Yellow River intake sluices, 55 siphon projects, 68 pumping stations, and 30 million acres of Yellow River irrigation and water replenishment areas, becoming China's largest gravity irrigation area.

	The development of hydropower in the Yellow River basin is even more astonishing, and it has become an important energy base in China. The abundant water resources of the Yellow River have also created conditions for the construction of coal bases in the middle reaches and oil bases in the lower reaches.

    好儿女年年治黄　“母亲河”岁岁安澜
    黄河在新中国实现巨变
    黄水两岸建起粮棉、能源和工业基地
    据新华社郑州9月4日电  （记者杨玉生、张玉林、武成德）沿黄人民付出巨大劳动、国家建设投资达百亿元的黄河，今年又安然度过伏秋大汛。至此，这条万里巨川伴随着人民共和国前进的步伐，40年岁岁安澜。劳动人民世代盼望的“黄河宁，天下平”在社会主义新中国开始变为现实。
    在中华民族五千年的历史上，黄河被称为“母亲河”。在它的哺育下，炎黄子孙创造了光辉灿烂的民族文化，造就了沃野千里的华北大平原。然而桀骜不驯的黄河也曾给两岸人民带来过深重的灾难。
    共和国刚刚成立，国家就把治理黄河作为安邦定国的重要措施。1952年10月，毛泽东主席首次离京就亲临黄河视察，并发出“要把黄河的事情办好”的号召。周恩来总理多次亲自主持治黄会议，从治河方略、决策实施到重大水利工程的布局，他都倾注了大量心血。1955年7月，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次全体会议通过了《关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的决议》。国家在财力十分紧张的情况下，先后投资上百亿元，为治理黄河提供了财力和物力基础。
    中央对黄河的关心，极大地鼓舞了沿河群众治理开发黄河的热情。地处黄河下游的山东、河南两省沿黄群众，40年来兴利除害，消灭堤身隐患33万处，新建改建石坝护岸5000多道，三次加高加厚千里长堤，搬动土石7亿多立方，这相当于建筑13座万里长城，开挖两条苏伊士运河。
    在黄河泥沙主要来源区的黄土高原，沿河群众数十年坚持不懈，植树种草，打坝淤地，修建梯田，进行小流域治理，大规模开展水土保持工作，成效卓著，水土流失最严重的粗沙区，有效治理面积已达10万平方公里，近15年来，平均每年减少入河泥沙1.8亿吨。
    黄河水利委员会的负责人向记者介绍说，从1911年到1946年的35年间，黄河下游发生一万秒立方以上洪水8次，有7次决口泛滥，千村万落漂冲一空。而建国40年来，发生同样大的洪水12次，却没有一次决口成灾。1958年，黄河下游发生建国以来最大洪水。花园口出现每秒22300立方米特大洪峰，滔滔浊浪，排山倒海，但两岸大坝却安然无恙，沿河人民安居乐业，创造了治黄史上的奇迹。
    40年来，黄河流域发生了历史性转变，我国最重要的粮棉、能源和工业基地先后在黄河流域建成，而正是黄河，为这些基地提供了丰富的水源。据统计，黄河两岸已建成5万亩以上的灌区200多处，灌溉面积由解放前的1200万亩发展到7000万亩。黄河下游新建引黄涵闸76座，虹吸工程55处，扬水站68座，引黄灌溉和补源面积达3000万亩，成为我国最大的自流灌区。
    黄河流域水电事业的发展更是令人惊叹，目前已成为我国的重要能源基地。丰富的黄河水源还为建设中游的煤炭基地和下游的石油基地创造了条件。
