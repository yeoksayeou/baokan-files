I watched the entire military arts festival's variety show with great interest. To be honest, my feelings were complex. In the midst of the general decline of variety arts, this performance showcased some excellent works. Although there were not many pieces, most of them were close to reality, enthusiastically singing the praises of the new life in the military during the era of reform and opening up. Satirical works hit the nail on the head, like roses with thorns, exuding the fragrance of life. Variety arts have a glorious tradition in our military arts work. Whether in times of war or peace, our variety artists have always been active on the front lines of the battle, serving as cultural cavalry. In this performance, variety arts also occupied an important position. Works reflecting military life and praising the beautiful hearts of soldiers were particularly outstanding. Whether it's a big story or a small episode, using comedic techniques and laughter to apply to all aspects of life, finding beauty in life at any time and place, and singing the praises of life's beauty. "Nǚlái Bǎo" (a type of folk song) "Deep Maternal Love," "My Friend," "Rapid Plank Book" "Loyal Souls Defending the Country," "Long Street Ballad," and "Shandong Rapid Book" "The Cucumber Incident" all use touching small events in life as creative material. Especially the Henan "Dropping Plank" "Soul Tied to the South China Sea" depicts a rural girl whose fiancé sacrificed himself on an island. The girl comes to the island to pay her respects to the fallen hero. The story seems ordinary, but it is deeply moving. When she cries out with a broken heart, "Today is the day your service ends, Mother says: 'I've come to fetch your soul,'" a love filled with the bitterness of the sea instantly turns into the tears of the audience. Composer Yu Linqing's arrangement adds a rich rural flavor to this piece. The cross-talk "One 'Famous' Person" chooses an angle cleverly, using a soldier with the same name as Lei Feng and the interesting episodes that happen in his life, reflecting that the spirit of Lei Feng lives on in the hearts of the people. The "Shandong Rapid Book" "Dialogue of Bullets" opens up a new path, with a clever structure and humorous language. The "Pingtan" (a type of folk song) "After Sunset in the Far Away" through the dialogue of an old couple who have been separated for forty years across the strait, sings out the era's voice of the people yearning for reunification.

Satirical works are not easy to write. If written falsely, it will be ineffective; if written shallowly, it will fail to achieve the intended satirical effect. However, many works in this performance use sharp and mocking language to appropriately criticize and lash out at the bureaucratism, deception, gift-giving, and other unhealthy practices in contemporary society. Such as the cross-talk "Brothers Are Good," "Gift-Giving," and "Shanxi Rapid Book" "Life's 'Eggs'." The cross-talk "Midnight Pig Cries" reflects some issues of encroaching on soldiers' interests through a few anecdotes about a company slaughtering pigs. Tang Wen Guang's "Rapid Plank Book" "Feasting and Drinking Aria" strongly criticizes the shocking corruption of eating and drinking at public expense in today's society, which can be described as incisive and refreshing. The ending of this piece uses "Stop your hand, stop your mouth, don't turn the people's money into private property!" This is indeed a direct expression of the people's heartfelt voice of concern for the country, love for the country, and urgency to strengthen the country. Works like "Feasting and Drinking Aria" with few characters, more narration, and resembling an essay are generally difficult for performers to handle, but this piece has won the audience's applause with its fresh appearance and skilled performance. Variety arts are easy to learn but difficult to master, seemingly minor, but with deep content. In variety arts creation, the most taboo is being slick and vulgar, while slick and humorous, farce and comedy, vulgar and popular are often just a thin layer of paper apart. Tang Wen Guang's grasp in creation is very measured.

It can be said that in this performance, whether in terms of works or performances, there are new explorations and pursuits. However, there are also many works that are still superficial, and the creative methods are also formulaic. While savoring some new works, one often finds lines and chapters that the audience is already very familiar with, which cannot but make us reflect. I believe that the military's variety artists will definitely see the gains and losses of the past few years from this performance and develop military variety arts.

　　笑的海洋　情的浪花
　　书诚
    我怀着浓厚的兴趣，看了全军文艺调演的曲艺晚会，说句实话，我的感受是复杂的，在整个曲艺不景气的状况下，这次调演竟涌现出了一些优秀的作品，虽篇数不多，但大都贴近现实，热忱歌颂改革开放中军营的新生活，讽刺作品则切中时弊，似带刺的玫瑰，散溢着生活的芬芳。曲艺在我军文艺工作中具有光荣传统，无论是战争年代还是和平建设时期，我军的曲艺工作者都活跃在战斗的第一线，成为文艺轻骑兵。在这次调演中，曲艺也占有重要位置。反映部队生活，歌颂战士美好心灵的作品仍然显得十分突出。大书一段事，小书一段情，把喜剧的手法、笑的手段应用于生活的方方面面，随时随地发现生活的美，讴歌生活的美。数来宝《慈母情深》、《我的朋友》、快板书《卫国忠魂》、《长街壮歌》、山东快书《黄瓜事件》都是以生活中的感人的小事为创作素材。特别是河南坠子《魂系南海》表现了一位农村姑娘的未婚夫牺牲在海岛，姑娘到海岛来祭英灵，故事似很平淡，但情深意切。当她撕心裂肺地喊出“今天是你服役期满的日子，娘说：‘是接你的魂来了’”时，一种饱蘸着苦涩海水的爱，顿时化作了观众的泪滴。作曲家于林青的编曲又为此篇作品增添了浓郁的乡土气息。相声《一“名”惊人》角度选得巧，以一位与雷锋同名的战士在生活中发生的几段趣事，反映了雷锋精神永存在人民心中。山东快书《子弹的对话》则独辟新径，结构巧妙，语言幽默。评弹《天涯黄昏后》通过海峡两岸相隔四十年又重逢的一对老人的对话，唱出了人民盼统一的时代心声。
    讽刺型的作品不太好写，写过了虚假，写浅了又会隔靴搔痒达不到讽刺之目的。而此次调演中的许多作品对现实社会中的官僚主义、弄虚作假、请客送礼等不正之风，用辛辣的笔触、嘲讽的语言、恰到好处地给予抨击和鞭挞。像相声《哥儿俩好》、相声《送礼》、陕西快书《人生“蛋”》等。相声《半夜猪叫》通过连队杀猪时的几段趣闻，反映了目前部队存在的一些侵占战士利益的问题。唐文光的快板书《吃喝咏叹调》有力地抨击了当今社会上的吃公喝公等令人发指的腐败现象，可谓鞭辟入里，痛快淋漓。此作的结尾，用了“快住手，快住口，不能把人民的钱财变私有！”这固然直露了一些，但确实呼出了人民群众发自心底的忧国、爱国、强国的急切心声。像《吃喝咏叹调》这样的少人物、多叙述、酷似散文体的曲艺的作品是一般演员难以驾驭的，而此作却以崭新的面貌、娴熟的演技，赢得了观众的阵阵掌声。曲艺艺术易学难工，貌似小道，内涵却深。在曲艺创作中最忌油滑与庸俗，而油滑与滑稽、闹剧与喜剧、庸俗与通俗常常又只隔着薄薄的一层纸。唐文光在创作中的把握就很有分寸感。
    应该说，在这次调演中无论从作品到表演，都有新的探索、新的追求。但是，也有不少作品还流于肤浅，创作的手法也沿袭程式。在咀嚼着一些新作的同时，时常发现早已被观众烂熟于心的台词和章节，这不能不引起我们深思。我相信部队的曲艺工作者一定能从这次调演中看到近几年的得失，使部队的曲艺有所发展。
