College admissions work is proceeding smoothly. Our newspaper reports from Beijing on September 13th: This year's national college admissions and enrollment work is proceeding smoothly. Currently, 19 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have completed their admissions tasks. Beijing, Xinjiang, and 11 other places are still in the process of enrollment, and it is expected that all will be finished by mid-to-late September.

This year's admissions work was conducted after the suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. Admissions committees in various places have generally taken measures to strictly enforce admissions discipline, implement an open admissions policy, publicize admissions plans, publicize the control line scores for each batch of schools, and publicize the enrollment results, thereby increasing the transparency of the admissions process.

During the enrollment period, discipline inspection and supervision departments were stationed at the enrollment sites, and reporting boxes and hotlines were set up inside and outside the enrollment sites to accept social supervision.

Many provinces and cities have implemented "closed" enrollment, using electronic computers to control document submission, effectively avoiding interference from human factors, and ensuring the fairness and reasonableness of college enrollment.

At the same time, various places have paid great attention to letter and visit (shēn fǎng) work, setting up reception stations outside the enrollment sites to promptly answer related questions.

　　高校招生工作进展顺利
    本报北京9月13日讯　今年全国普通高等学校招生录取工作进展顺利，目前已有19个省、自治区、直辖市圆满完成了招生任务，北京、新疆等其它11个地方的录取工作尚在进行，预计本月中、下旬将全部结束。
    今年的招生工作是在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱后进行的。各地招生委员会普遍采取措施，严肃招生纪律，实行公开招生政策，公开招生计划，公开各批院校录取控制分数线，公开录取结果，增加了招生工作的透明度。
    在录取期间，纪检、监察部门进驻录取场地，并在录取场内外设立了举报箱、举报电话，接受社会的监督。
    许多省市实行了“封闭式”录取，并采用电子计算机控制投档，有效地避免了人为因素的干扰，确保高校录取新生的公正、合理。
    同时，各地十分注意信访工作，在录取场外设立接待站，及时回答有关问题。
