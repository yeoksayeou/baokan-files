Jiang Zemin Meets with All Members of a Study Class; Song Ping and Li Ruihuan Attend Discussion
Focus on Wholeheartedly Relying on the Working Class
Strengthen Enterprise Ideological and Political Work

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 25 (Reporter He Ping) — This afternoon, Song Ping and Li Ruihuan, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, held a discussion with all members of the national enterprise ideological and political work study class at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. They emphasized that strengthening ideological and political work in enterprises is determined by the nature of socialist enterprises and the status of the working class. This work must be strengthened and improved in practice to better meet the needs of the new situation.

Before the discussion, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, met with all attendees of the discussion and emphasized the importance of strengthening ideological and political work in enterprises. He hoped that everyone would contribute ideas and find ways to make enterprise ideological and political work adapt to the current situation.

This study class was jointly organized by the Central Propaganda Department and the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association. Over 150 people, including leaders from more than 100 large enterprises across the country, as well as officials from relevant departments of the State Council and some provinces and cities, participated in the study class.

Ding Guanggen, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, also attended the discussion. The meeting was presided over by Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. Li Chuanhua, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association, first reported on the relevant situation of the study class.

During the discussion, Chen Xiaoda, Secretary of the Beijing Railway Bureau Party Committee, Li Yutang, Secretary of the Party Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, Li Peiquan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Baoshan Iron and Steel General Plant in Shanghai, Jiang Xuemin, Secretary of the Party Committee of Qilu Petrochemical Company, Du Shouquan, Secretary of the Party Committee of Yueyang Petrochemical Plant, and Yin Wen, Director of the Inspection Office of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company, shared their views on how to strengthen enterprise ideological and political work in the new situation.

Song Ping said in his speech that our party has always attached great importance to ideological and political work, which is the lifeline of all our work and a precious legacy. However, in recent years, this work has been significantly weakened, and we have made major mistakes in this regard. We should have an adequate assessment of this. However, we should also see that party ideological and political workers have done a lot of work. Our political work tradition has not been lost, the political work team has not dispersed, and with the development of the situation, some new experiences have been created. This should also be fully affirmed.

Song Ping pointed out that enterprise ideological and political work should be centered around wholeheartedly relying on the working class, firmly establishing the working class's sense of ownership, and fully mobilizing their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity in building socialism. At the same time, we must persistently carry out education on communist ideals, education on the four cardinal principles, education on national conditions, and vigorously publicize the deeds of labor models and other advanced examples. The current focus of ideological and political work is to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization.

Song Ping reiterated that in enterprises, we must adhere to the factory director responsibility system, while also strengthening the work of the party committee. The factory director and the party secretary should support and cooperate with each other. Only by strengthening the construction of grassroots party organizations and giving full play to their political core role and the exemplary role of party members can enterprise ideological and political work have a reliable guarantee.

Li Ruihuan said that the current enterprise ideological and political work mainly faces two problems. The first is the issue of whether to strengthen it. We need to work hard to clarify this theoretically. We are a socialist country, fundamentally different from capitalist countries in that the people are the masters of the state. Socialist enterprises are not just economic organizations; in addition to producing material products for the modernization drive, they also undertake the task of cultivating "four-haves" new people. Therefore, systematic political and ideological education must be carried out for the broad masses of workers in enterprises. The other issue is how to strengthen it. First of all, we must clarify that the effective traditions, methods, and approaches of ideological and political work that our party has formed over many years must be adhered to. At the same time, there is an issue of adapting to the needs of the new situation, an issue of improvement and reform, which is indeed a new topic we are facing.

Li Ruihuan pointed out that there are many problems that need to be studied and solved in strengthening enterprise ideological and political work. We hope that everyone, under the premise of clarifying the general direction, will give full play to their subjective initiative, explore, summarize, and create new experiences in practice.

    江泽民会见一研讨班全体同志  宋平李瑞环参加座谈
    围绕全心全意依靠工人阶级
    切实加强企业思想政治工作
    新华社北京9月25日电　（记者何平）中共中央政治局常委宋平、李瑞环今天下午在中南海怀仁堂同全国企业思想政治工作研讨班的全体同志座谈时强调，在企业加强思想政治工作是社会主义企业的性质和工人阶级的地位所决定的，这一工作必须加强，并要在实践中加以改进，以更加适应新形势的需要。
    座谈会之前，江泽民总书记会见了出席座谈会的全体同志，并强调了在企业加强思想政治工作的重要性。他希望大家多出主意，想办法，使企业思想政治工作适应当前形势发展的需要。
    这次研讨班由中宣部和中国职工思想政治工作研究会共同举办。全国100多家大型企业的负责人以及国务院有关部委和部分省市的同志共150多人参加了研讨班。
    中共中央政治局候补委员丁关根也出席了座谈会。会议由中宣部部长王忍之主持。中国职工思想政治工作研究会副会长兼秘书长李传华首先汇报了研讨班的有关情况。
    座谈会上，北京铁路局党委书记陈效达、长春第一汽车制造厂党委书记李玉堂、上海宝山钢铁总厂党委副书记李沛泉、齐鲁石化公司党委书记姜学敏、岳阳石化总厂党委书记杜寿全、攀枝花钢铁公司视察室主任阴温，围绕着如何在新形势下加强企业思想政治工作发表了意见。
    宋平在讲话中说，我们党历来重视思想政治工作，它是我们一切工作的生命线，是传家宝。但是近几年，这一工作有很大削弱，我们在这方面有重大失误，对此应有足够的估计。但是也应看到，党的思想政治工作者做了大量工作，我们的政工传统并没有丢，政工队伍没有散，而且随着形势的发展创造了一些新鲜的经验，对这点也要充分给予肯定。
    宋平指出，企业思想政治工作要围绕全心全意依靠工人阶级这一中心来进行，牢固树立工人阶级的主人翁思想，充分调动他们建设社会主义的主动性、积极性和创造性。同时，还要坚持不懈地对他们进行共产主义理想教育，坚持四项基本原则的教育，国情的教育，要大力宣传劳动模范等先进典型的事迹。当前思想政治工作的重点是坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。
    宋平重申，在企业中，要坚持厂长负责制，同时，党委的工作也要加强，厂长和书记要互相支持，互相配合。只有加强基层党组织的建设，发挥其政治核心作用和党员的先锋模范作用，企业思想政治工作才有可靠保障。
    李瑞环说，当前企业思想政治工作主要面临两个问题。第一个是要不要加强的问题。对这个问题要下功夫从理论上加以阐明。我们是社会主义国家，与资本主义国家根本不同之点是：人民是国家的主人。社会主义的企业也不单纯是经济组织，除了为四个现代化建设生产物质产品外，还承担着培养“四有”新人的任务。因此，在企业中必须对广大职工进行系统的政治思想教育。另一个问题是如何加强的问题。首先要明确的是，我们党多年形成的行之有效的思想政治工作传统、方式方法必须坚持。同时也有一个与新形势的发展需要相适应的问题，有一个改进、改善的问题，这确实是我们面临着的一个新课题。
    李瑞环指出，加强企业思想政治工作有许多问题需要研究解决，希望大家在大方向明确的前提下，发挥主观能动性，在实践中去摸索、总结、创造新鲜经验。
