The General Administration of Customs has announced a reward system for individuals who report or assist in the investigation of cases violating customs laws. The system began implementation at the beginning of this month, and the General Administration of Customs has recently published the reporting telephone number and mailbox for this purpose.

The new system expands the scope of rewards to include the reporting of tax evasion cases, among others, and has increased the reward limits for reporters.

For reporters residing abroad, the reward can be partially or fully paid in foreign currency. Customs will strictly keep confidential the identities of reporters and the reward details.

　　检举走私有奖
　　海关总署公布举报电话
    新华社北京9月11日电　（记者张毅）海关总署发布的对检举或协助查获违反海关法案件有功人员奖励办法，已于本月初开始实施，海关总署近日为此公布了举报电话和信箱。
    新的办法扩大了奖励范围，将检举偷逃关税等案件也包括在奖励范围内，同时提高了对检举人的奖励限额。检举走私案者，海关按照实际查获私货变价收入的10％以内发给奖励金，最高不超过人民币10万元。对由于检举而查获的其他案件，属于补征税款挽回国家经济损失的，按补税和罚款总额的3％以内发给奖励金。对有特殊贡献的举报人，经海关总署批准，奖励金不受上述数额限制。对居住在境外的检举人，奖励金可以部分或全部发给外币。海关对举报人及奖励情况负责严格保密。
    海关总署负责人表示，欢迎境内外人员向海关检举揭发走私等违法行为。检举人可向所在地海关举报，也可向海关总署调查司举报：地址——北京市太平桥大街4号，邮政编码——100810，举报电话——北京6015669，举报信箱——中华人民共和国海关总署第8号信箱。
