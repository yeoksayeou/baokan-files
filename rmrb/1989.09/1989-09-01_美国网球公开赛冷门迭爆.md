Upsets Galore at the U.S. Open

The second round of the men's U.S. Open tennis tournament saw a series of upsets, with the fourth seed McEnroe and the fifth seed Wilander both falling in surprising defeats.

McEnroe, a four-time U.S. Open champion, was unexpectedly defeated 1-3 by Dutch player Paul Haarhuis, who is ranked 115th in this year's Grand Slam tournament and is relatively unknown in the tennis world. This loss occurred in front of McEnroe's home crowd on August 30th.

Less than three hours after McEnroe's elimination, the defending champion and this year's fifth seed, Wilander, also suffered a 2-3 defeat to 18-year-old Pete Sampras on the same court.

In the second round, other seeded players such as Lendl, Edberg, Agassi, and Zhang Depei all won their matches and advanced to the third round.
