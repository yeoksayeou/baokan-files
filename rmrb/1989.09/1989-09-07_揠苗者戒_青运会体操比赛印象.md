Title: A Lesson for Those Who Pull Up the Sprouts—Impressions from the Youth Games Gymnastics Competition

The gymnastics competition has just begun. Experts have high hopes for 12-year-old Zhang Jinjing from the Beijing men's team, but unfortunately, he injured his right foot. It's tough on the kid; he climbed onto the horizontal bar with a limp, his eyes red, clearly holding back tears as he performed. The national training team coach, Xie Tiehua, sitting next to me, watched Zhang Jinjing on the bar and suddenly asked me, "Do you think it's more important to win the Youth Games championship here, or to win championships in international competitions in the future?" Seeing me taken aback, he said, "I understand these coaches. If they don't perform high-difficulty moves, they won't get good rankings, and it will be hard for them to report back."

Sitting by the gymnastics arena for less than two hours, I witnessed many young athletes performing high-difficulty moves like flying on the bar, but I didn't get to enjoy the artistic charm and beauty of gymnastics. Watching these young athletes compete in "hanging" moves was quite heart-wrenching. I heard that a 9-year-old girl from the Hebei women's team might perform tomorrow, probably the youngest athlete in the Youth Games. I hope they succeed.

The key to winning in gymnastics competitions is twofold: first, solid basic techniques and flawless execution; second, innovative moves and difficulty, with the former being the foundation for the latter. Young athletes should focus on building a strong foundation, but unfortunately, the Youth Games do not have a special scoring system that prioritizes the former. The children are forced to perform, and the success rate is predictable.

Xie Tiehua told the reporter that a few days ago, he led his team to participate in the Japanese International Youth Gymnastics Competition. Huang Liping from the Chinese team defeated strong opponents from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Romania, and Japan, winning the individual all-around and two individual event championships. Huang Liping's moves were not particularly difficult, but he executed them with excellent form, earning high praise from the audience and judges. It seems that China's gymnastics reserve talents and potential strength are not a concern. The key issue lies in improving the training system and correcting the development vision, emphasizing more science and reducing blind actions.

### 揠苗者戒——青运会体操比赛印象

    揠苗者戒
    ——青运会体操比赛印象
    体操比赛刚刚拉开战幕。行家们都看中了北京男队12岁的张津京，不料他却伤了右脚。真难为这孩子了，跛着伤脚又攀上了单杠，眼圈红红的，分明是忍住泪水登场的。坐在我身边的国家集训队教练谢铁华眼盯着杠上翻飞的张津京，突然问我：“你说，是在这里拿青运会冠军重要，还是将来到国际大赛上拿冠军重要？”他见我一愣，便说：“我理解这些教练，不上难度就拿不到名次，回去难交帐啊！”
    坐在体操赛场边不到两个钟头，目睹了不少娃娃演出杠上飞行等高难动作，但总觉得没有欣赏到体操的艺术韵味和美感的享受，看着小选手们比着玩“悬”，怪让人揪心的。听说明天河北女队可能有9岁的小姑娘亮相，大概是青运会年龄最小的运动员了，但愿她们顺利。
    夺取体操比赛优胜的旨要，一是扎实的基本技术和无可挑剔的动作质量；二是动作和编排的创新及难度，前者是后者的基础和条件。青少年选手本来应该打好基础，可惜，我们的青运会并未规定以前者为主要标准的特殊评分办法。孩子们勉为其难，成功率可想而知。
    谢铁华告诉记者，前两天他带队参加日本国际少年体操比赛，中国队黄力平战胜苏联、民主德国、罗马尼亚、日本等强手，取得个人全能和两个单项冠军。黄力平动作难度并不出众，但规格质量完成得很好，深得观众和裁判好评。看来，中国体操运动的后备人才和潜在实力并不足虑，问题的关键在于完善训练体系和校准发展眼光，多讲科学，减少盲目。
