    The marginal inscriptions of seal carving, according to historical records, began in the Yuan Dynasty with Zhao Mengfu (also known as Songxue Dao Ren). On the sides of the seals he carved, such as "Songxue Studio" and "Zhao Family of Tian Water," he inscribed the characters "Ziang." During the Ming Dynasty, Wen Peng further developed this practice. In addition to carving names and dates, he also inscribed descriptions of various objects. In the Qing Dynasty, figures like Deng Wanhai and Ding Jing can be said to have used the stone as paper, recording everything. Zhao Zhicheng, a descendant of the Deng school, included not only text but also patterns in his marginal inscriptions; the text was also divided into intaglio and relief. By this point, the marginal inscriptions on the seal stone had become an integral part of the seal carving art. They not only annotate and explain the seal text but also express the author's thoughts and emotions. They can also record the reasons for carving the seal and discuss seal carving art, serving as textual evidence and records. The calligraphic styles of marginal inscriptions include regular, cursive, clerical, and seal scripts, with the number of characters ranging from a few to over a hundred. They can be appreciated not only for their calligraphy and illustrations but also as references for seal carving techniques.

　　篆刻的边款
    据史料记载，篆刻边款始于元朝的赵孟頫（号松雪道人），他所刻治的“松雪斋”和“天水赵氏”二印的侧面，刻有“子昂”两字。明朝的文彭进一步发展了它，文字内容除刻姓名、年月外，还刻上一些事物的记述。清朝的邓完白、丁敬等诸家可以说是以石为纸，无所不记。赵之谦（邓派后人）的边款除文字外还有图案；文也分为阴文和阳文。至此，印石上的边款已成为篆刻艺术创作的组成部分。它不但可以注释解说印文，也可以抒发作者的思想感情，还可以记叙治印的原因和评讲篆刻艺术，作文字考证记录等。边款的书法体式有正草隶篆，字数从数字到百余字不等。它不但能作为书法、绘图来欣赏，还能当作篆刻技法资料来借鉴。
