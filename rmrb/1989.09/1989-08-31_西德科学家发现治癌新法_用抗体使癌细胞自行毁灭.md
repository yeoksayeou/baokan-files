West German scientists have discovered a new method for treating cancer by using antibodies to stimulate receptors on the surface of cancer cells, causing them to self-destruct. They believe this method could become a highly effective means of cancer treatment.

The phenomenon of cell self-destruction is common in nature. For example, during embryonic development and the metamorphosis of caterpillars into butterflies, some cells become redundant and are no longer needed. At this point, a chemical signal is sent through the bloodstream, commanding these redundant cells to self-destruct. The self-destruction signal is detected by special receptors on the cell surface, the cell cytoplasm contracts, the cell membrane breaks down, the DNA in the cell nucleus fragments, and the cell dies within a few seconds.

The Heidelberg Cancer Research Center in West Germany transplanted human tumors into mice and injected the mice with antibodies for these special receptors. Under a microscope, it was observed that the tumors were shrinking, and the cancer cells were self-destructing.

This research is still in its early stages and will require several more years of study before it can be tested on humans.

    西德科学家发现治癌新法
    用抗体使癌细胞自行毁灭
    据新华社伦敦8月29日电  据《星期日泰晤士报》报道，联邦德国科学家的实验证明，用抗体刺激癌细胞表面受体能够使癌细胞自行毁灭。他们认为，这种方法可能成为一种非常有效的癌症治疗手段。
    细胞自毁现象在自然界很普遍。如胚胎发育和毛虫变蝶时，有些细胞变为多余，不再需要。这时候，通过血液发出一种化学信号，命令这些多余的细胞自行毁灭。自毁信号被细胞表面上的特殊受体检起，细胞质收缩，细胞膜分解，细胞核中的脱氧核糖核酸分裂成碎片，细胞在几秒钟内死亡。
    联邦德国海德堡癌症研究中心把人体肿瘤移植入老鼠体内，给老鼠注射这种特殊受体的抗体。在显微镜下观察到肿瘤收缩，癌细胞正在自行毁灭。
    这项研究目前还处于早期阶段，需要再经过几年的研究才能用于人体试验。
