In streets and rural areas, one often encounters situations where two people who were almost ready to draw knives shake hands and make amends, or a couple on the brink of divorce reconcile. The mediators who handle these cases breathe a sigh of relief and smile with satisfaction. This is the role played by China's mediation work, which has been praised by foreign experts as an "Eastern experience."

Over the past forty years since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, mediation work has been continuously developing, improving, and maturing. It has become an integral part of the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system, and is increasingly welcomed by the people. From 1982 to 1988, the number of mediation committees increased from 860,000 to over 1 million, a 16% increase. The number of mediators grew from nearly 500,000 to over 6 million, a 20% increase. They mediated nearly 50 million civil disputes, equivalent to five to ten times the number of first-instance civil cases handled by grassroots people's courts. They prevented 680,000 potential abnormal deaths. These figures alone show the role and status of mediation work in social life.

Mediation work plays a role in organizing the people to manage state and social affairs, and often serves as an assistant to grassroots party and government organs and judicial organs. Mediators are ordinary citizens who are fair, can connect with the masses, and have a certain level of legal knowledge and policy understanding. Although they hold no official rank or power, because they understand the joys and sorrows of thousands of households, they are respected and trusted by the masses, who often see them as trusted friends they can confide in. They are well-informed and can promptly reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, problems arising in society, and the seeds of disputes to grassroots leadership departments. They can also convey the party's policies, guidelines, and relevant legal knowledge to the masses through mediation work. Tang Zhuqing, an old mediator from the East Station Sub-district Committee in Erdaohezi, Changchun City, Jilin Province, has visited the doors of over 500 households in his sub-district over the past 27-28 years of mediation work, resolving over 100 neighborhood disputes. He has spread love and affection in that alley, fostering a sense of responsibility among the residents to care for their neighbors, society, and national affairs. In many grassroots units, one can hear stories of praise for "our old mediators." These "old mediators" have become a force in organizing the masses to participate in managing state and social affairs.

Mediation work is seen as the first line of defense in legal work. Mediators, through patient guidance and persuasion, prevent social conflicts from escalating, reduce crimes, and promote social stability and harmony within families and neighborhoods. Zhang Donghua, the mediator from Zhenxing Street in Huaiyin District, Jinan City, Shandong Province, has been engaged in mediation work for 26 years, reconciling 36 families that were once at odds, reuniting 34 couples on the verge of divorce, and bringing harmony to 42 families that were in constant conflict. He also prevented 16 potential murder tragedies. If one were to look through the records of mediators' deeds, one would find countless stories of mediators bravely stepping forward at critical moments when disputes are about to escalate. Due to their responsible work, they have minimized the escalation of civil disputes, prevented some people from committing crimes in a moment of anger, reduced many potential economic losses and casualties, strengthened people's unity, and promoted social stability.

Mediation work has also played a significant role in the construction of material and spiritual civilization. According to statistics, over the years, the types of disputes mediated include marriage, family, property, neighborhood relations, production and operation, inheritance, support and maintenance, debts, compensation, and more than ten other categories, with the largest number being marriage and family disputes. Through mediation work, people are freed from marriage, family, and neighborhood disputes, allowing them to focus their energy on production.

With the development of socialist legal construction, the quality of mediators continues to improve. In the past, some "old mediators" often relied on their prestige, experience, and social moral customs to mediate, with limited legal knowledge. With the promotion of legal knowledge education in various places, many mediators actively study and apply the law, using legal and policy standards to judge right and wrong during mediation. Some mediators have even been hired as part-time lawyers by local legal advisory offices. It can be said that in the future, the "Eastern experience" will play an even greater role in China's legal construction.

    东方经验
    ——介绍我国的人民调解工作
    本报记者　晓渡
    在街道、农村，常常可以见到这样的情况：当两位几乎要动刀的“仇人”握手言和时，当一对几乎破裂离异的夫妻重归于好时，担任调解工作的人民调解员如释重负，舒心地笑了。这就是被国外人士赞誉为“东方经验”的我国人民调解工作所显示的作用。
    建国四十年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，人民调解工作在不断发展、完善和成熟，成为社会主义民主与法制建设的一个组成部分，并日益受到人民群众的欢迎。从一九八二年到一九八八年，调解委员会由八十六万多个发展到一百多万个，增加了百分之十六；调解人员由近五十多万人，发展到六百多万人，增加了百分之二十；共调解各类民间纠纷近五千万件，相当于基层人民法院一审民事收案数的五至十倍；防止可能发生的非正常死亡现象六十八万人次。仅从这些数字，就可以看到人民调解工作在社会生活中的作用和地位。
    人民调解工作具有组织人民参加管理国家事务和社会事务的作用，也常常起到基层党政机关和审判机关的助手作用。人民调解员是一些普通公民，为人公正，能联系群众，具有一定法律知识和政策水平。他们虽然“官”无品，职无权，但因为了解千家万户的喜怒哀乐，受到群众的尊重与信任，常常被群众看作可说知心话的亲人，显得有职有权。他们信息灵通，能把群众的意见要求、社会上出现的问题和纠纷苗头及时反映到基层领导部门；还能通过调解工作，将党的方针、政策和有关法律知识，传达群众。吉林省长春市二道河子区东站十委的老调解主任谭竹清，在二十七八年的调解工作中，踏遍了全委五百多户居民的门槛，调解了上百起邻里纠纷，把一腔爱和情洒在那条小巷里，也使那条小巷的居民养成了关心邻里、关心社会、关心国事的当家作主思想。在许多基层单位，都可听到称颂“我们的老调解”的故事，“老调解”们也已成为联系、组织群众参与管理国家事务和社会事务的力量。
    人民调解工作被看作政法工作的第一道防线。调解员们通过耐心疏导，说服调解，防止社会矛盾激化，预防和减少犯罪，促进社会秩序的安定和家庭、邻里的和睦团结。山东省济南市槐荫区振兴街的调解主任张东华，担负了二十六年调解工作，使三十六个曾反目为仇的家庭重归于好，使三十四对濒临破裂的夫妻恩爱如初，使四十二个吵闹不休的家庭老少咸和，还防止了十六起可能引发的凶杀悲剧。如果翻阅一下有关调解员的事迹记载，我们可以看到许许多多人民调解员不畏凶险、临危不惧，在纠纷趋于激化的关键时刻挺身而出的动人故事。由于他们认真负责的工作，把民间纠纷的激化减少到最低限度，防范和制止了某些人因一时的激怒造成刑事犯罪，减少了许多可能造成的经济损失和人畜伤亡，增强了人民团结，促进了社会安定。
    人民调解工作，也在物质文明和精神文明建设中发挥了很好的作用。据统计，这些年来调解纠纷的种类有婚姻、家庭、房产宅基地、邻里关系、生产经营、继承、赡养抚养、债务、赔偿等十余类，其中婚姻、家庭等纠纷数量最大。通过调解工作，把群众从婚姻、家庭及邻里纠纷中解脱出来，把精力用到生产上去。
    随着社会主义法制建设的发展，调解人员素质不断提高。过去，一些“老调解”往往凭自己的威望、经验和社会道德习俗进行调解，有的法律知识较少。随着普及法律常识教育在各地推开，许多调解人员积极学法用法，调解时能运用法律与政策来评判是非，有些调解员还被当地法律顾问处聘为兼职律师。可以肯定，今后“东方经验”在我国法制建设中将发挥更大的作用。
