Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 3rd.

	The Industrial and Commercial Administration and Public Security departments will take measures to fully support and cooperate with the tax authorities in strengthening the tax collection and administration for individual and private enterprises, and severely crack down on violent tax evasion cases.

	The vice minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, Gan Guoping, said at the national tax bureau directors' meeting held here that in recent years, China's individual economy has developed rapidly. By the end of 1988, the number of individual industrial and commercial households nationwide had reached 14.52 million. The number of people engaged in this sector was 23 million, with a total capital of 3.12 billion yuan and a business turnover of 11.9 billion yuan. The development of individual economy in urban and rural areas has promoted commodity circulation, developed production, activated the market, and at the same time expanded employment channels and increased state fiscal revenue. However, at present, the situation of tax evasion by individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises is very serious. Some individual households and private enterprises engage in illegal business operations and tax evasion to make huge profits, becoming "overnight millionaires." They use bribery and other means to corrupt officials, indulge in eating, drinking, prostitution, and gambling, seriously undermining social morality.

	Gan Guoping believes that rectifying the tax order and strengthening the tax collection and administration for individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises is an important part of rectifying the economic order. Gan Guoping emphasized that strengthening the tax work for individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises is one of the key tasks for this year's tax work. To this end, the industrial and commercial administration departments must strengthen the supervision and management of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises through the industrial and commercial administration departments to cooperate with the tax authorities to do a good job in this regard.

	Gan Guoping required the industrial and commercial administration departments to check and urge individual households and private enterprises to establish accounts and register for tax purposes through daily supervision and management. For individual households and private enterprises that do not register for tax purposes, the industrial and commercial administration departments should cooperate with the tax authorities to deal with them; for those who refuse to establish accounts, the industrial and commercial administration departments should take serious measures, including revoking their business licenses.

	Vice Minister of Public Security, Yu Lei, also said at the meeting that he would actively cooperate with the tax authorities to strengthen the tax collection and administration for individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises, especially to severely crack down on those who evade taxes, gather crowds to storm tax authorities, and assault tax officials.

    加强对个体工商户私营企业税收征管
    工商公安将全力配合税务部门
    严厉打击暴力抗税案件
    新华社北京9月3日电  （记者丁坚铭）国家工商行政管理局和公安部有关负责人昨天在此间表示，工商行政管理部门和公安部门将采取措施，全力支持和配合税务部门加强对个体工商户和私营企业税收的征收管理，严厉打击暴力抗税案件。
    国家工商行政管理局副局长甘国屏在正在此间召开的全国税务局长会议上说，近几年我国个体经济发展较快，到1988年底，全国城乡个体工商业户已发展到1452万户。从业人员达2300万人，拥有资金312亿元，营业额1190亿元。城乡个体经济的发展，促进了商品流通，发展了生产，活跃了市场，同时也扩大了就业渠道，增加了国家财政收入。但是，目前个体工商户和私营企业偷漏税情况十分严重，一些个体户和私营企业通过违法经营、偷税漏税，牟取暴利，成了“暴发户”，他们采取行贿等手段，拉拢腐蚀干部，吃喝嫖赌，严重败坏了社会风气。
    甘国屏认为，整顿税收秩序，加强对个体工商户和私营企业的税收征管工作，是整顿经济秩序的一项重要内容。甘国屏强调，加强个体工商户和私营企业的税收工作是今年税务工作的重点之一。为此，工商行政管理机关一定要通过加强对个体工商户和私营企业的监督管理，配合税务机关搞好这项工作。
    甘国屏要求工商行政管理机关要通过日常的监督管理，检查、督促个体户和私营企业建帐和进行税务登记。对不进行税务登记的个体户和私营企业，工商行政管理机关要配合税务部门予以处理；对拒不建帐的，工商行政管理机关要作出严肃处理，直至吊销营业执照。
    公安部副部长俞雷也在会上表示，要积极配合税务部门加强对个体工商户和私营企业的税收征收管理，特别是要严厉打击那些偷税抗税，聚众冲击税务机关，殴打税务干部的犯罪分子。
