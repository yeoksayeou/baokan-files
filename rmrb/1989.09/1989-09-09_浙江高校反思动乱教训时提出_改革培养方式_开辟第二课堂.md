Zhejiang's educational circles have focused on one central topic while reflecting on the lessons of the recent turmoil: strengthening university ideological and political work requires reforming training methods to make participation in practical training a compulsory course for colleges and universities.

Materials indicate that the recent turmoil affected more than 40 colleges and universities in Zhejiang Province, with the majority of those involved being students and young teachers. Their deviation from the correct path is related to their unique growth experiences, having gone from home to school without much social practice, leading to a shallow understanding of national conditions and a significant gap between their comprehensive qualities and the requirements of the state and society.

Some college leaders believe that opening a "second classroom" to allow university students to directly participate in social practice, interact with workers and peasants, and study national conditions is a feasible way to reform university training methods and improve the quality of university students. Over the past two years, Zhejiang University has established five off-campus teaching bases in different departments, attempting factory-school joint education, allowing students to engage in social practice, with noticeable results. The leaders of this key university said that in the future, they plan to select some advanced large enterprises to establish school-wide off-campus bases, further improving the "second classroom" teaching.

Over the past year, Zhejiang Province organized the first batch of young university political theory teachers to go to the grassroots for on-the-job training, which has shown initial results. Nine young theory teachers from four colleges and universities were assigned to villages to serve as assistant mayors and cultural assistants. After eight months of practical training, these young teachers deepened their understanding of national conditions and their knowledge of society.

Recently, the second batch of young university theory teachers has also gone to the grassroots for on-the-job training. A relevant official from the Zhejiang Provincial Committee's Propaganda Department, who is in charge of this work, said that this should become an institutionalized practice and be continued.

### 浙江高校反思动乱教训时提出  改革培养方式　开辟第二课堂

    浙江高校反思动乱教训时提出
    改革培养方式　开辟第二课堂
    本报杭州9月9日电　浙江教育界反思动乱教训时的一个集中话题是：加强大学思想政治工作，应该改革培养方式，使参加实践锻炼成为大专院校的一门必修课。
    有材料表明，前些日子的动乱波及浙江省40多所大专院校，而卷入者绝大多数是学生和青年教师。他们误入歧途，与特殊的成长经历有关，从家门到校门，脱离社会实践，对国情了解肤浅，导致其综合素质与国家要求、社会需求相距较远。
    一些大专院校的领导者认为，开辟“第二课堂”，让大学生直接参与社会实践，接触工农，研究国情，是改革大学培养方式、提高大学生素质的一条可行途径。浙江大学在过去两年里，已有5个系建立校外教学基地，尝试厂校联合教育，使学生深入社会实践，颇有收效。这所重点大学的领导说，今后还准备选择一些先进的大企业，建立全校性校外基地，进一步完善“第二课堂”教学。
    在过去的一年里，浙江省组织首批大学青年政治理论教师下基层任职锻炼，初见成效。来自4所大专院校的9名青年理论教师分别到农村担任乡长助理、文教助理。经过8个月的实践锻炼，这些青年教师加深了对国情的了解，对社会的认识。
    最近，第二批大学青年理论教师亦已下基层任职锻炼。负责这项工作的浙江省委宣传部有关同志说，这要成为一项制度坚持下去。
