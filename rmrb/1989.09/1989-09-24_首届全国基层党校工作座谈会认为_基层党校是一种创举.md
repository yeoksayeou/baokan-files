The first national conference on grassroots party schools was held from September 20 to 23 in Tai'an, Shandong Province. The conference concluded that grassroots party schools are a new phenomenon that emerged after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They are an innovation by the broad masses of Party members and grassroots Party organizations, and an effective means of strengthening the Party's ideological education. They have played an active role in promoting the education of grassroots Party members, enhancing the ideological and political quality and scientific and cultural level of the Party membership, and further strengthening the cohesion and combat effectiveness of grassroots Party organizations.

Participants in the conference agreed that grassroots party schools, as an important front in strengthening the Party's ideological education under new circumstances, have the fundamental task of conducting education on the "three basics" of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's basic line, and basic Party knowledge. Currently, it is particularly important to actively strengthen the education on the basic theories of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, to overcome the neglect and indifference towards theoretical learning, and to enable more Party members to learn to use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to observe problems, analyze contradictions, and explore solutions. Currently, it is particularly important to focus on education regarding the adherence to the four cardinal principles, opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and the re-education on basic Party knowledge, to educate Party members to firmly uphold communist beliefs, and to strive for the Party's overall tasks and goals in the current stage.

This conference was convened by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. More than 120 people attended the meeting, including officials in charge of Party member education from the propaganda departments of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, representatives of advanced examples of grassroots party schools, and some municipal and prefectural committee officials, as well as propaganda department heads from cities and prefectures in Shandong Province.

    首届全国基层党校工作座谈会认为
    基层党校是一种创举
    本报济南9月23日电　新华社记者吴广生、本报记者尹品端报道：首次全国基层党校工作座谈会9月20至23日在山东省泰安市召开。会议认为，基层党校是党的十一届三中全会以后产生的新生事物，是广大党员和党的基层组织的一种创举，是加强党的思想建设的一种有效形式。它对推动基层党员教育工作，提高党员队伍的思想政治素质和科学文化水平，进一步增强基层党组织的凝聚力、战斗力，发挥了积极作用。
    参加座谈会的同志认为，基层党校作为新形势下加强党的思想建设的重要阵地，它的根本任务是要向党员进行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基本理论、党的基本路线和党的基本知识的“三个基本”教育。当前特别要积极加强马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想基本理论的教育，克服对理论学习荒疏淡漠的现象，使更多的党员学会运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法观察问题，分析矛盾，探索解决问题的答案。当前尤其要突出抓好坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化和重新进行党的基本知识的教育，教育党员坚定共产主义信念，为党在现阶段的总任务、总目标奋斗。
    这次座谈会是由中共中央宣传部主持召开的。各省、自治区、直辖市党委宣传部主管党员教育工作的负责同志，基层党校先进典型代表和部分地、市委负责同志和山东省地市委宣传部长等共120多人出席了会议。
