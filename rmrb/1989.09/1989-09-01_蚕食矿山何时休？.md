Residents near the Xiangtan manganese mine have been illegally mining and digging, seriously endangering the safety of the mine's operations. The mine's facilities have been repeatedly damaged, and the overall mining plan has not been properly implemented. Over the past five years, this has resulted in a loss of over 500,000 tons of minerals for the state, amounting to a value of over 10 million yuan. Currently, there are still over 70 illegal mining holes actively operating day and night, devouring the mine. Meanwhile, the residents' mining activities lack necessary safety equipment and technical knowledge, leading to frequent accidents. This situation is detrimental to both the country and the people.

    蚕食矿山何时休？
    湘潭锰矿附近的群众在矿中心采区滥采乱挖，严重危及矿山的开采安全；矿山的一些设施屡遭毁坏；矿山的整体开采规划得不到正确实施。近5年来，使国家损失矿量50多万吨，价值达1000多万元。现在，矿区仍有70多个非法窿洞在日干夜战，蚕食矿山。同时，群众挖矿，既无必备的安全设施，又不懂技术，事故不断，于国于民利少弊大。
