	Taiwan Province has over seventy kinds of crops. Among them, rice, sugarcane, and tea are known as the "Three Treasures" of Taiwan.

	Rice: Taiwan's rice varieties include "Ponglay Rice," "Native Rice," "Glutinous Rice," and "Dryland Rice." The regions with the highest production are Taichung, Hsinchu, Tainan, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. In recent years, Taiwan has produced approximately 2.4 million metric tons of rice annually, with "Ponglay Rice" being the most famous.

	Sugarcane: Sugarcane fields are ubiquitous across the island. The main production areas are south of the Dajia River, downstream of the Dadu River to the Choshui River alluvial plain, and the Hualien Plain in the east. Tainan has the highest production. In recent years, Taiwan's annual sugar production has exceeded 1 million metric tons, making it one of the key sugar-producing regions in China. It is renowned as the "Sugar Depot" and the "Sweet Island."

	Tea: Taiwan's tea varieties are diverse, including black tea, oolong tea, and green tea. Among them, "Frozen Summit Oolong Tea," known for its "green leaves with golden edges and a lingering aroma after seven infusions," is the most prized. This tea is produced in Nantou County. The famous "Pine and Cypress Evergreen Tea" is also produced in this region.

	In recent years, Taiwan's annual tea production has exceeded 26,000 metric tons, with the majority being exported.
