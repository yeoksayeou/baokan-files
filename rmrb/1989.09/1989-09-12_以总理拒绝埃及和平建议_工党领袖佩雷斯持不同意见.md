Israeli Prime Minister Rejects Egyptian Peace Proposal
Work Party Leader Peres Holds Different Opinion

TUNIS, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tunis Africa News Agency, citing an Israeli radio broadcast, reported that Israeli Prime Minister Shamir announced on the 11th that he opposes discussing the 10-point peace proposal put forward by Egyptian President Mubarak regarding elections in the occupied Palestinian territories.

The report said that Shamir also arrogantly reiterated that Tel Aviv would "unconditionally" uphold its own election plan for the occupied territories.

According to another report, Israeli official spokesman Pazner also made a statement, demanding that Egypt must, in principle, accept Israel's peace initiative.

He added that neither Egypt nor any other Arab country has yet accepted Israel's initiative.

On the 11th, Israeli Finance Minister and Labor Party leader Peres believed that the peace proposal by the Egyptian president could serve as a basis for negotiations.

　　以总理拒绝埃及和平建议
    工党领袖佩雷斯持不同意见
    新华社突尼斯9月12日电　突尼斯非洲通讯社援引以色列电台的广播说，以色列总理沙米尔11日宣布，反对讨论埃及总统穆巴拉克提出的关于在巴勒斯坦被占领土举行选举的10点和平建议。
    报道说，沙米尔还傲慢地重申特拉维夫“不折不扣”地维护它自己提出的关于被占领土的选举计划。
    另据报道，以色列官方发言人帕兹内尔也发表谈话，要求埃及必须原则上接受以色列和平倡议。
    他还说，无论是埃及还是任何阿拉伯国家至今都尚未接受以色列的倡议。
    11日，以色列财长、工党领袖佩雷斯认为，埃及总统的和平建议可以作为谈判的基础。
