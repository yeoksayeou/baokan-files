The *Complete Works of Zhu Guangqian*, often compared to the "Gezhouba Dam Project" in the field of aesthetics, was overseen by Wang Chaowen, Ji Xianlin, and Zhu Dexi (as well as the late Mr. Ye Shengtao and Mr. Shen Congwen). Through the joint efforts of Anhui Education Press, 7 volumes have already been published, with the remaining 13 volumes currently in the process of being edited and are expected to be completed by 1991. In an era where "publishing is difficult, and publishing good books is even more difficult," the *Complete Works of Zhu Guangqian* has been praised by the academic and publishing communities for its profound content and exquisite printing, truly deserving of the accolades.

Mr. Zhu Guangqian is a renowned aesthetician, literary theorist, philosopher, educator, and translator in China. The establishment of aesthetics as an independent science occurred in modern times. Pioneers such as Wang Guowei, Cai Yuanpei, and Lu Xun made outstanding contributions to the construction of modern aesthetics in China. However, it was not until the early 1930s that China had its own influential works on aesthetics, and aesthetics had not yet separated from literary theory to become an independent discipline. Mr. Zhu is one of the pioneers and founders of modern aesthetics in China. His 1930 publication, *Schools of Abnormal Psychology*, was the first objective introduction to the schools of abnormal psychology in China, marking the beginning of modern psychological exploration of deep-seated mental states. His 1933 work, *Abnormal Psychology*, is the only book in China that discusses abnormal psychology. His 1936 publication, *Psychology of Literature and Art*, is the first book to systematically discuss aesthetics in a clear and engaging manner since Cai Yuanpei's advocacy of "Aesthetic Education in Place of Religion" (as described by Zhu Ziqing in the preface to *Psychology of Literature and Art*). Psychology is the logical starting point for Mr. Zhu's aesthetic thought system. In the 1940s, Mr. Zhu published *Poetry Theory*, the first systematic study of poetic theory in China since the May Fourth Movement, marking a milestone in modern Chinese poetics. In the 1960s, Mr. Zhu's *History of Western Aesthetics*, written from a Marxist perspective, is the first Western aesthetics history written by a Chinese author and is a monumental work. The academic community in China, especially the younger generation, has systematically and comprehensively understood modern Western aesthetics through Mr. Zhu's foundational works. Mr. Zhu has made outstanding contributions to the establishment of aesthetics as a young science in China. His writings such as *Twelve Letters to the Youth*, *On Beauty*, and *On Literature* were once widely popular and moved countless readers.

Mr. Zhu was well-versed in both ancient and modern knowledge, bridging Eastern and Western cultures, and was a renowned scholar. From a young age, he was influenced by the Tongcheng School, with a solid foundation in classical Chinese literature. He was also proficient in English, French, German, and Russian, allowing him to directly appreciate foreign classics and cultivate his "global perspective and broad-mindedness." From the May Fourth Movement to the eve of liberation, Mr. Zhu consistently emphasized the comparison of Chinese ancient aesthetic thoughts with Western aesthetic thoughts, becoming one of the pioneers of comparative aesthetics and comparative literature in China. While promoting national culture, he translated Marxist classics and important works by Western aestheticians and literary theorists based on China's needs, such as Marx's *Theses on Feuerbach* and key chapters of *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, Plato's *Dialogues on Art*, Lessing's *Laocoön*, Eckermann's *Conversations with Goethe*, Hegel's *Aesthetics*, and Vico's *New Science*, among others. The high quality and quantity of his translations are rare in China's translation history.

Mr. Zhu was steadfast and diligent, whether in good times or bad, he always devoted himself to scholarship, learning extensively, discerning clearly, and acting with integrity, seeking and striving forward. He educated students with his moral character and literary works, nurturing batch after batch of young and middle-aged teachers. From the *Complete Works of Zhu Guangqian*, one can see not only his profound and rigorous theoretical system and scholarly style but also his humble and self-effacing scholar's demeanor, as well as his sincere desire to pursue Marxism. Mr. Zhu's tumultuous life has set a profound example for later generations of scholars in their exploration and progress.

    一代宗师的详实写照
    商金林
    被喻为美学界的“葛洲坝工程”的《朱光潜全集》聘请了王朝闻、季羡林、朱德熙（还有已故的叶圣陶、沈从文二位老先生）担任顾问，经过安徽教育出版社的共同努力，现已出书7卷，其余13卷正在抓紧编辑，可望在1991年出齐。在“出书难，出好书更难”的今天，
  《朱光潜全集》以内容的精湛、印制的精良，受到学术界和出版界的好评，是当之无愧的。
    朱光潜先生是我国著名的美学家、文艺理论家、哲学家、教育家、翻译家。美学之成为一门独立的科学，是在近代。王国维、蔡元培、鲁迅等先驱者为我国现代美学的建设作出了卓越的贡献。但是直到本世纪30年代初，我国还极少自己的影响广泛的美学专著，美学还没有与文艺理论分家，成为一门独立的学科。朱先生是我国现代美学的开拓者和奠基者之一。他在1930年出版的《变态心理学派别》，是我国第一部客观的介绍变态心理学派别的专著，开了现代心理学探索深沉心理的先河。1933年出版的《变态心理学》，是我国仅有的一部论述变态心理学的专著。1936年出版的
  《文艺心理学》，是蔡元培先生提倡“美育代宗教说”以来，第一部讲得“头头是道，酉覃酉覃有味的谈美的书”（朱自清《“文艺心理学”序》），而心理学就是朱先生所赖以建立自己美学思想体系的逻辑起点。朱先生在40年代出版的《诗论》，是我国“五四”以来第一部系统研究诗学理论的专著，是我国现代诗学的第一块里程碑。60年代，朱先生以马克思主义观点撰述的《西方美学史》是中国人写的第一部西洋美学史，是一部巨著。我国学术界，特别是青年一代系统全面地了解西方现代美学，正是靠了朱先生的这几部奠基作。朱先生为美学在我国成为一门年轻的科学作出了杰出的贡献。他撰写的《给青年的十二封信》、
  《谈美》、《谈文学》等“通俗读物”，也曾风靡一时，感动过成千上万的读者。
    朱先生博览古今，贯通中西，是蜚声四海的大学问家。他从小受桐城派的影响，有深厚的国学和文学根基，又精通英、法、德、俄等国文字，可以直接欣赏外国名著，从而孕育了他的“世界的眼光和开阔的襟怀”。从“五四”到解放前夕，朱先生一直注重探讨中国古代美学思想与西方美学思想的比较，成为我国现代比较美学和比较文学的拓荒者之一。他在弘扬民族文化的同时，从我国的需要出发，翻译了马克思主义经典著作和西方美学家、文艺理论家的重要代表作，如马克思《费尔巴哈论纲》及《1844年经济学——哲学手稿》的一些关键性的章节、柏拉图《文艺对话集》、莱辛
  《拉奥孔》、爱克曼《歌德谈话录》、黑格尔
  《美学》、维科《新科学》，等等，译文质量之高、数量之多，在我国翻译史上是罕见的。
    朱先生坚毅勤恳，无论是在顺境还是在逆境中，他总是潜心学术，博学、明辨、笃行，开拓求索，勇猛精进，用自己的道德文章孜孜不倦地教育学生，培养了一批又一批的中青年教师。从《朱光潜全集》中，不仅可以看到他博大精深的理论体系和严谨明晰的学风；也能看到他虚怀若谷，谦冲自牧的学者风范，以及追求马克思主义的真诚愿望。朱先生坎坷曲折的一生，对于后生学子的探索前进展示了一个深刻的典范。
