    The bustling market of Wuzhong, a famous trading hub since the Ming and Qing dynasties with "tens of markets, bustling with people shoulder to shoulder," has, over the past 40 years since liberation, especially since the construction of the fully enclosed "Wuzhong Market" in 1986, developed into the largest material distribution center in the northwest region.

    The Wuzhong Market covers a total area of 27,500 square meters, with the entire roof made of glass-reinforced plastic. From above, the market is structured like a giant lotus flower, with a second-floor cross-shaped street and four trading halls for vegetables, fruits, meats, light industrial products, production materials, and grains and miscellaneous goods. Surrounding the cross-shaped street are nearly 500 shops run by state-owned, collective, and individual businesses selling cotton and needlework products, daily necessities, clothing and hats, hardware and electrical goods, sweets, alcohol, snacks, and various restaurants. Excluding mobile vendors, there are more than 1,500 fixed stalls inside and outside the four trading halls, offering over 5,000 different kinds of goods. The market also has a savings office, post office, and police station, making it a small commercial city.

    Over the past three years, this market has attracted more than 360 businesses from various provinces and regions across the country to set up operations. The market sees nearly 60,000 visitors daily, with up to 100,000 on market days. The daily transaction volume is over 160,000 yuan, and the total transaction volume in 1988 exceeded 60 million yuan. Last year, it was awarded the title of "National Civilized Market" by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Since 1986, the "Wuzhong Market" has hosted more than 6,500 visitors, including party and state leaders such as Wang Zhen, provincial and municipal leaders, international friends, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau. Revolutionary elder Xiao Ke, after visiting, wrote in admiration: "Market prosperity reaches the northwest, economic takeoff looks to Wuzhong."

    市场繁荣连西北
    吴忠，这个早在明清时期就“列市数十处，逢集至者骈肩累足，极为繁盛”的著名商埠，解放40年来，特别是1986年集资兴建了全覆盖式“吴忠市场”后，已发展成为西北地区最大的物资集散地。
    吴忠市场建筑总面积2.75万平方米，整个天棚为玻璃钢覆盖。俯视场内，由二层楼十字形街道和蔬菜瓜果肉食、轻工产品、生产资料及粮油杂品四个交易大厅组成一巨大莲花状结构。十字形街道四周分布国营、集体、个体经营的针棉织品、日用百货、服装鞋帽、五金交电、糖酒副食、风味餐馆等近500家商号。除流动小贩外，四个交易大厅内外还有各类固定摊点1500余个，经营的商品多达5000余种。场内还设有储蓄所、邮电所、派出所等管理服务机构，俨然一座小商业城。
    3年来，这座市场吸引了全国各省区的360多家商户设点经营。这里平时客流量近6万人次，每逢集日人头攒动，高峰时有10万余人次，日均成交额16万多元，1988年总成交额突破了6000万元，去年被国家工商局授予“全国文明市场”称号。1986年至今，“吴忠市场”先后接待了王震等党和国家领导人、省市领导及国际友人、港澳同胞等6500余人。老一辈革命家肖克同志参观后欣然题词赞曰：“市场繁荣连西北，经济腾飞望吴忠。”　（蒋森麟）
