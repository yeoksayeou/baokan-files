How can the Party's ideological and educational work adapt to the demands of the times, unite the hearts of millions of Party members, form an impregnable fortress, and have a persuasive and attractive force among the people? The Rizhao City Committee of Shandong Province has grasped the pulse of the times and actively explored this topic, ensuring that the Party's ranks maintain ideological purity, withstand various tests in the tide of reform and opening up, and demonstrate the Party's role.

After Rizhao was approved by the State Council to be upgraded from a county to a city in 1985, the Rizhao City Committee first convened a meeting of the Standing Committee. They reviewed the experiences and lessons of large and medium-sized cities across the country in reform and opening up, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the quality of Party members and Party cadres in Rizhao, and the potential problems that might arise during reform and opening up. They proposed to conduct Party nature and ideological education among Party members on "withstanding the test of reform and opening up, resisting corruption and never being tainted." They established more than 70 Party schools in factories, mines, enterprises, and township governments, using these platforms to train and educate more than 50,000 Party members across the city. They held lectures on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and commodity economy and related policy knowledge. During a period when few people talked about the value of Communist Party members and the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly was fading, the Rizhao City Committee did not forget the Party's glorious traditions. They emphasized using practical actions to educate Party members and forge the soul of Party members.

Arriving at the shore where waves are rolling, looking out to the vast sea, the endless expanse is cut off by a 15-li long giant dragon. "Block the sea? You must be dreaming." "The water is so deep, and the tides are so strong, are you a god?" "How much money will it cost? 13 million yuan, if it fails, who will bear the risk?" "I will, Mou Shanyu!" In the early spring of last year, when it was still chilly, Mou Shanyu, the Party secretary of the Shitou Office of Rizhao City, along with nearly a hundred cadres, carried their bedding and food, just like the old Party members of the past, set up camp at Jingu Bay. Together with the Party members and masses of 11 fishing villages, they completed a large-scale sea-blocking project. Mou Shanyu, this more than 50-year-old old Communist Party member, worked day and night like the laborers, bare-chested in the sea, directing and carrying stones; the already ailing Mou Shanyu collapsed in the pile of stones more than 10 times, still directing while receiving an IV drip; the Party cadres and he were the same, not returning home for several months, struggling on the construction site. They ate fried pancakes, dry steamed buns, and corn porridge, leading more than 5,000 workers to toil for more than four months, building a stone dam 30 meters high and 15 li long in the sea more than 10 meters deep, blocking the sea over 3,000 mu, and building 5 small fishing ports. The "Conqueror's Whip" of that year has now become a treasure trove. The fishermen of Jingu Bay say: "The sea-blocking dam is the Party's soul dam!"

Recalling the scene of building the dam, an over 70-year-old old fisherman wiped his tears and said excitedly: "I saw the Communist Party members of the past on this dam! When money was needed to block the sea, we fishermen voluntarily took out our savings, you 5,000, he 10,000, and in a few days, we raised 2 million yuan."

In the era of reform and opening up, facing personal interests and collective interests, what kind of answer should Party members give? How should they appear before the people? The investigation results of the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission show that the vast majority of Party members have proven to be qualified through assessments. In June of this year, the State Council approved the original Rizhao City (county-level) to be upgraded to a prefecture-level city with independent planning. Building a large city, a considerable number of comrades face the issue of going or staying, some need to be promoted, and some will be transferred from the government to the grassroots level. This is a real problem facing every Party member and cadre. Currently, not a single Party member and cadre has run around seeking favors, causing trouble for the Party organization, nor has anyone asked for "consideration." The morale of more than 500 municipal cadres has not been scattered, and their work enthusiasm has not diminished, embodying the excellent qualities of Communist Party members.

Looking at the Party members and cadres in the townships: a survey report shows that more than 2,000 township Party members and cadres rooted in the grassroots level face the difficulty of their children finding jobs and going to school. More than 38% of young Party members and cadres face the difficulty of finding a partner, as urban girls do not want to marry "country bumpkins." In the face of personal interests, they unconditionally obey the Party's needs, do not make conditions, and do not engage in indirect transfers. Most of the cadres distributed in the mountainous areas live in the villages for years, working with the farmers, developing water conservancy, and helping to develop commodity economy. Especially in critical issues of personal gain and loss, Party members first give the convenience to the people. The broad Party members and cadres of Chen Cun Township work hard and diligently. The township has consecutively ranked first in the city for grain and oil procurement for several years. Last year, the municipal government awarded them 35,000 yuan in bonuses. Who should the bonus be given to? The Party members proposed to give it to the rural cadres. Once, the city allocated an agricultural-to-non-agricultural household registration quota to the township. Seven Party members and cadres met the conditions for agricultural-to-non-agricultural household registration. Who should the quota be given to? The Party committee held several meetings but could not decide. The reason is that the seven households that met the conditions did not want it, each with their own reasons, pushing and pulling each other. The township leaders were at a loss. Who should it be given to? Initially, it was decided to give it to the deputy secretary Xiao Zexiang, who had joined work in 1958, but he refused to take it, saying that the conditions of five ordinary cadres and one retired cadre were sufficient. After pushing and pulling, none of the on-duty cadres wanted it. This matter had a significant impact among the cadres and the masses. People said that in critical moments, the high moral character of Party members can be shown. The Rizhao City Committee integrates the education of Party members into practical work, winning the trust and support of the people for the Party.

    铸造党员之魂
    ——记山东省日照市党的建设
    党的思想教育工作如何同形势的要求相适应，把千万颗党员的心连结在一起，形成一个攻不破的坚固堡垒，在群众中具有感召力和吸引力？山东省日照市委摸准时代的脉搏，积极探索这一课题，使党员队伍的思想始终保持纯洁性，在改革开放浪潮中经受住各种考验，显示了党的作用。
    1985年日照被国务院批准由县改市后，日照市委首先召开了常委会，纵观全国大中城市在改革开放中的经验和教训，全面分析日照党员素质、党员干部情况及在改革开放中可能会出现的问题，提出在党员中进行“经受改革开放考验，拒腐蚀永不沾”的党性教育和思想教育，先后在厂矿和企事业单位、乡镇机关建起了70多处党校，利用这个阵地，对全市5万多名党员进行教育轮训，举办马列主义、毛泽东思想知识讲座及商品经济和有关政策知识讲座。一个时期以来，在很少有人讲共产党员的价值，全心全意为人民服务观念淡薄的时候，日照市委没有忘记党的光荣传统，注重在实践中用事实教育党员，铸造党员之魂。
    来到波浪翻滚的大海岸边，极目望去，茫茫的大海被一条15华里的巨龙东西切断。“拦海！做梦吧。”“水位这么深，潮汐这么急，你是神仙？”“得多少钱！1300多万元，要是拦不成，谁担这个风险？……”“我，牟善玉！”去年初春，乍暖还寒，日照市石臼办事处党委书记牟善玉和近百名干部，背上铺盖，带上干粮，像当年老党员那样，来到金沟湾安营扎寨了。他们同11个渔村的党员群众一道完成拦海大型工程。牟善玉，这位50多岁的老共产党员日夜和民工一样，赤身露臂泡在海里指挥、扛石头，连续作战；本已多病的牟善玉10多次累倒在石堆里，仍一边打着吊针一边指挥；党员干部们和他一样几个月不回家，拚搏在工地上。他们吃煎饼、干馒头，喝玉米稀饭，带领5000多民工苦战4个多月，硬是在10多米深的海里筑起了高30多米，长宽15华里的石坝，拦海3000多亩，还兴建了5个小渔港。当年的“霸王鞭”，如今变成了聚宝盆。金沟湾一带的渔民们说：“拦海大坝是党魂坝！”
    回忆起筑坝的情景，一位70多岁的老渔民揩着眼泪激动地说：“俺在这大坝上又看到当年的共产党员！拦海缺钱，俺渔民们自发地拿出了存折，你5000，他1万，不几天就凑了200万元。”
    在改革开放的时代，面对个人利益与集体利益，党员应该作出什么样的回答？以怎样的形象出现在群众中？对此，市纪委的调查结果表明：绝大多数党员通过考评证明都是合格的。今年6月，国务院批准原日照市（县级）改升为地级计划单列市。建大市，有相当一部分同志面临去留问题，有的需要提升，有的将调离机关下基层，这是摆在每个党员干部面前的现实问题。目前，没有一个党员干部跑门子，给党组织出难题，没有要“照顾”的，全市500多名机关干部人心不散，工作劲头不减，体现了共产党员的优良品质。
    再看一看乡镇党员干部：一项调查统计的报告数字表明，全市扎根基层的2000多名乡镇党员干部，50％面临子女就业上学难。38％以上的青年党员干部，面临找对象难，因城里姑娘不愿嫁“乡下郎”。在个人利益面前，他们无条件的服从党的需要，不讲条件，不搞曲线调动，多数分布在山区的干部常年住村包点，同农民打成一片，兴修水利，帮助发展商品经济。尤其是在个人得失的关键问题上，党员首先把方便让给群众。陈疃乡的广大党员干部工作踏实肯干，该乡连续几年粮油收购居全市第一。去年，市政府奖给了他们3500元奖金。奖金该给谁？党员们提出分给农村干部。一次市里分给该乡一个农转非名额，有7个党员干部符合农转非条件，名额该分给谁？党委开了几次会都分不下去。原因是，7个够条件的户都不肯要，理由各有各的，你推我让，乡领导们犯难了。到底分给谁？起初，决定分给1958年参加工作的副书记绍泽相，可他说啥也不要，理由是5个一般干部和一个退休干部的条件都够了。让来让去，在职的干部谁也不要。这事在干部、群众中反响较大，人们说在关键时刻方能体现党员的高风亮节。日照市委把对党员的教育寓于实际工作中，赢得了人民群众对党的信赖和拥护。
