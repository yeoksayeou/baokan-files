The subtropical climate of Guangxi ensures a year-round abundance of various fruits and vegetables. In addition to meeting the needs of the local population, the canning industry has flourished in recent years. The number of canning factories has grown from one in the 1950s to over 130 in the 1980s. The main products include sugar-water pineapple, sugar-water lychee, sugar-water mandarin oranges, sugar-water lotus root, sugar-water longan, green beans, mushrooms, and more than 20 other varieties. In 1989, the production volume reached 162,000 tons, making Guangxi a leading producer in China. These canned goods are exported to over 80 countries and regions around the world.
