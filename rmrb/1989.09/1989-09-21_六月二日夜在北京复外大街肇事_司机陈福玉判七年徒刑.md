	Driver Chen Fuyu, who caused a major traffic accident by speeding and violating traffic rules on Fuxingmen Outer Street in Beijing on the night of June 2, was sentenced to seven years in prison by the West City District People's Court of Beijing today for the crime of causing a traffic accident resulting in death.

	The defendant Chen Fuyu is a driver for the Fifth Brigade of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police. In July 1988, he was temporarily assigned to the 40th Anniversary Film Crew of the Central Television Station to drive and assist with filming.

	On the night of June 2, 1989, around 10 PM, Chen Fuyu was driving a Mitsubishi Jeep from the film crew's location back to the brigade's base. When the Jeep was traveling west to east on Fuxingmen Outer Street at an excessive speed, it skidded to the right due to the high speed and wet road surface, hitting the 320 bus stop sign, destroying five barriers, crossing the non-motorized vehicle lane, and flipping over onto the south side pedestrian walkway. It struck four individuals who were riding bicycles in the non-motorized vehicle lane: Wang Xinmin (female, 36 years old, cadre), Tian Yonglin (male, 34 years old, cadre), Zhai Jianguo (male, 28 years old, individual entrepreneur), and Liu Liwei (male, 27 years old, teacher). Three of them died, and Liu Liwei is still receiving treatment in the hospital.
