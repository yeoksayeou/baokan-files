Today, with a mixture of excitement and sorrow, I report to you the two completely different attitudes we encountered in the 17 hours after our child was lost.

On June 27th, my wife and I took our child from Beijing on the 11th express train back to Northeast China. At 6 PM, the train arrived at Shenyang South Station. Upon exiting, our 8-year-old daughter ran off. At that time, the station square was crowded with people, and we were extremely anxious. I immediately went to the station's broadcasting room and asked the announcer to make an announcement. This female announcer coldly replied, "We don't handle cases of lost children!" and then closed the door. Helpless, we went back to the square to search again, but still couldn't find her. So, we went to the broadcasting room twice more to beg the announcer for help, even offering money, but we were still turned away. In desperation, I ran to the station's police station to report the case. The police there barely paid any attention, saying, "This isn't a nursery." I then went to the police station in front of the station. There, three police officers warmly received me. They offered me a cup of tea, took out paper and pen, and asked me to write down the child's name, appearance, and address in detail. Then, they told me to go to the Peace District Public Security Bureau to file a report. By this time, it was already past 10 PM. I went to the Peace District Public Security Bureau, and the duty officer immediately notified all the patrol teams in various police stations to look for my child. The next morning at around 10 AM, the police station in front of the station called to say that the child had been found at the Chongwen Police Station in the Huanggu District. When we arrived at the Chongwen Police Station and saw our daughter safe and sound, we were so moved that we didn't know what to say.

It turned out that at around 11 PM on the 27th, an unnamed squad leader from this police station was about to go off duty when he saw a little girl crying on the street outside, looking for her parents. He abandoned his plan to go home, brought her back to the police station, and while trying to find her parents, he washed her face and feet and bought her many snacks. Thus, the child spent the night safely under the care of this dedicated squad leader. After hearing the story, my wife and I were so touched that we shed tears. When I offered 30 yuan as a reward to thank the squad leader, he politely declined.

    孩子丢失以后
    今天我怀着既兴奋又痛心的心情，向你报反映我孩子丢失后17个小时里所遇到的两种截然不同的态度。
    6月27日，我和妻子带着孩子从北京乘坐11次特快列车回东北，晚上18时列车到达沈阳南站，出站后8岁的女孩跑丢了。当时，车站广场人山人海，我俩心急如焚。我立即到车站广播室，请求播音员广播一下，这位女播音员冷冰冰地说：“孩子丢失的事我们不管！”便将房门关上了。无奈，我们又来到广场上再次寻找，还是找不着，于是又两次上广播室哀求播音员帮忙，并表示出多少钱都可以，可还是被拒绝于门外。我焦急万分地跑到车站派出所报案，派出所的人也爱理不理地说：“这里不是托儿所。”我又到站前广场派出所，这里3位民警热情地接待了我，他们给我泡上一杯茶，掏出笔和纸，让我把孩子的姓名、相貌特征及住址等详细写下。尔后，他们让我去和平区公安分局报案。此时已是夜里10点多钟了，我来到和平区公安分局，值班人员立即通知各派出所巡逻队注意寻找我家孩子的下落。次日上午10点多钟，站前广场派出所传来消息：孩子已在皇姑区崇文派出所里。到了崇文派出所，望着安然无恙的孩子，我们激动得不知说啥好。
    原来，27日深夜11点钟左右，这个派出所的一位不肯说出姓名的指导员，正准备下夜班回家，忽然看见门外大街上有一个小女孩哭泣着寻找父母。他便放弃了回家的念头，把她抱回了派出所，一边到处联系寻找孩子父母，一边为孩子洗脸洗脚，还给孩子买了许多好吃的。就这样，孩子在这位指导员的热心照顾下安稳地度过了一宿。听完叙述，我们夫妇俩感动得流下了泪水。当我拿着30元钱作为酬金要感谢这位指导员时，他却婉言谢绝了。
