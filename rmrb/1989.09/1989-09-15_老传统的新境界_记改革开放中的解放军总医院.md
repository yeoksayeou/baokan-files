The largest comprehensive hospital in the military—Beijing General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—has opened its doors to society and the world in the tide of reform and opening up. In recent years, while continuing to serve the military wholeheartedly, they have also treated a large number of local patients and established academic exchange relationships with more than 10 countries around the world. Nowadays, more and more patients are flocking to this hospital, and more and more complex and difficult cases are providing a broad stage for medical practice by medical staff. Hospital Director Liang Guozhang said: "It is reform and opening up that have filled the hospital with vitality and hope."

There is a place that does not look at money

Treating local patients is an old tradition of the hospital. In recent years, amidst the public's cries of "difficulty in seeing a doctor, difficulty in being hospitalized," the Beijing General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has opened its doors to society even wider.

Last March, 17-year-old Li Ning, a female student from Yueyang County, Hunan Province, suddenly contracted acute granulocytic leukemia. Her family learned from the provincial medical college that to save Li Ning's life, a bone marrow transplant surgery was necessary, but the cost would be at least 30,000 yuan. News of a common farmer's daughter contracting the same disease as the protagonist, Sachiko, in the Japanese TV drama "Blood Suspicion" moved the hearts of millions in her hometown. Workers, peasants, cadres, and students all donated money for her. Li Ning, accompanied by her brother, came to Beijing General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with over 20,000 yuan in donations.

Although Li Ning's funds were insufficient, the hospital still admitted her. The medical staff formulated a meticulous surgical treatment plan for Li Ning. Due to their superb skills, after large-dose radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and bone marrow transplant surgery, Li Ning miraculously had no high fever, no cross-infection, and no graft-versus-host reaction. On the 23rd day after the surgery, Li Ning's blood count returned to normal, and the surgery was very successful. When she was discharged, Li Ning and her brother held the doctors' and nurses' hands, tears streaming down their faces, unable to speak for a long time.

Dian Jianmin, a Beijing worker who had suffered from chronic thrombocytopenic purpura for over four years, urgently needed a kidney transplant. After being turned away by several local hospitals due to the inability to raise the tens of thousands of yuan needed for the surgery, his father was desperate. In a moment of desperation, he went to the Beijing Municipal Committee to appeal on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Mayor Chen Xitong listened to the family's plea and immediately wrote a letter, instructing them to take the child to the Beijing General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After Dian Jianmin was admitted, he quickly underwent his first kidney transplant surgery. However, due to a hyperacute rejection reaction post-surgery, the transplanted kidney had to be removed three days later, and his life was maintained only by hemodialysis. In February this year, the urology department of the hospital successfully performed a second kidney transplant for Dian Jianmin and waived over 6,000 yuan in medical and medication fees for the financially struggling Dian Jianmin. After recovering, Dian Jianmin sincerely said, "It is the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army that gave me a second life!"

Over the years, the general hospital has saved how many Li Nings and Dian Jianmins; the medical staff have long forgotten. Many patients, out of gratitude, secretly gave gifts and red envelopes to the medical staff, but all were politely declined. The hospital returned over 10,000 yuan in gifts, including RMB, HKD, and gold necklaces, last year.

A patient sighed, "In China, there is still a place that does not look at money. The medical staff of the PLA hospital not only have superb medical skills but also have high medical ethics. They have a heart that shines like gold!"

The doors here are open to the world

A few years ago, under the leadership of Director Liang Guozhang, the hospital proposed boldly opening its doors to the world. Now, they not only have extensive academic exchanges with more than a dozen countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hong Kong, but they have also sent batches of key personnel abroad for study and training, cultivating batch after batch of talents for the military hospital.

Interestingly, many foreign friends learned about the general hospital through their personal hospital stays. One day, the Italian ambassador fell ill and was admitted to the hospital. This ambassador, familiar with China, found that the technical level and service attitude of this military hospital were far superior to other hospitals in Beijing. After his admiration, he reported the above situation to his home country's government, which was selecting health aid recipients. Thus, the Italian government decided to provide the general hospital with $4.65 million in advanced emergency equipment free of charge and accepted 70 medical staff from the hospital to study in Italy in batches.

Mr. Ho Ying-tung, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, came to Beijing from Hong Kong for a meeting and happened to fall ill. When he learned that the hospital, despite financial difficulties, still allocated over 200,000 yuan annually to waive medical and medication fees for some economically disadvantaged patients, Mr. Ho Ying-tung was deeply moved. He immediately decided to donate a state-of-the-art lithotripter to the hospital. This year, he donated another $300,000 to the hospital to purchase machine accessories.

Since 1984, nearly 500 internationally renowned experts and professors have come to the general hospital for academic exchanges and visits. Among them, 89 experts were appointed as honorary professors and technical consultants by the hospital. These experts either regularly come to the hospital to teach, or provide funds for the hospital's overseas study personnel, or provide the hospital with the latest medical information. Through academic exchanges, the hospital's latest research achievements are also continuously introduced to the world. More than ten experts and professors from the hospital have been appointed as academic committee members by foreign academic institutions.

In addition to sending over a hundred experts and scholars abroad for visits, observations, and investigations, nearly a hundred people have gone abroad to pursue degrees and study, with over 60 already returning to China. Most of them have played outstanding roles in clinical and research work. Dr. Liu Guosuo studied in Belgium and West Germany and passed his doctoral thesis defense in less than a year. He returned to the general hospital shortly after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing.

"Opening up to the outside world has fundamentally changed the hospital's appearance," said Director Liang Guozhang. "Recently, Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Military Commission said that the policy of reform and opening up will not change. We military medical workers are greatly encouraged. Continuing to open up to the outside world, the country has great hope."

Spare no effort to share the country's burdens

Bed shortages, financial difficulties... All hospitals face these contradictions, and the general hospital is no exception. Additionally, military hospitals have some unique challenges in the era of reform and opening up. At 57, Major General Liang Guozhang, as the hospital's leader, has a deep understanding of this. He said, "The general hospital not only has heavy medical tasks but also bears part of the health responsibilities for central and military commission leaders. The hospital's work cannot afford any mistakes. These years, I, as the director, have always felt like walking on thin ice."

Insufficient funds are the biggest difficulty. Each year, the funds allocated by higher authorities are less than one-third of what the hospital needs. Without money, they cannot buy drugs and equipment, let alone add new equipment or improve working conditions. The Party committee proposed that they should not only solve the people's difficulties but also share the country's burdens. In times of national economic difficulty, they neither ask for more from above nor overcharge or arbitrarily charge patients. Instead, they fully leverage their technical advantages to establish a cosmetics factory and more than ten other factories, taking the path of supporting medicine with auxiliary industries.

In recent years, the hospital's Party committee has focused on both economic and social benefits, formulating a series of civilized medical principles. For critically ill patients, they are treated first without asking for money. This hospital has never had scandals such as prescribing large amounts of medication or refusing to treat patients who should be admitted. They go all out to treat difficult and critical cases. Although the number of outpatient visits and admissions has increased significantly, the technical level and medical quality have continued to improve. The bed turnover rate and cure rate have reached historical highs, while the medical accident rate has dropped to a historical low. In 1985 and 1988, there were no medical accidents. Moreover, medical staff have conducted scientific research combined with clinical practice. The hospital has won 262 national and military science and technology awards of the first, second, and third classes in five years. Recently, the Central Military Commission and the General Logistics Department leaders have fully affirmed the work of the general hospital.

　　老传统的新境界
　　——记改革开放中的解放军总医院
　　本报记者　赖仁琼
    全军最大的综合性医院——北京解放军总医院，在改革开放的大潮中，向社会和世界敞开了大门。几年来，他们在坚持全心全意为部队服务的同时，还收治了大量地方患者，并与世界上10多个国家建立了学术交流等关系。如今，越来越多的病人涌向这家医院，越来越复杂的疑难病症为医护人员的医疗实践提供了广阔的舞台。院长梁国章说：“是改革开放使医院充满活力，充满希望。”
      有这么一块不向钱看的净土
    收治地方病人是该院的老传统了。近年来，在群众一片“看病难、住院难”的呼声中，解放军总医院面向社会之门开得更大了。
    去年3月，湖南省岳阳县17岁的女中学生李宁突然患急性粒细胞白血病。家属从省医学院打听到，要挽救李宁的生命，必须做骨髓移植手术，但费用至少需要3万元。一个普通农家女得了与日本电视剧《血疑》主人公幸子一样的病，消息牵动了家乡千千万万人的心。工人、农民、干部、学生纷纷为她捐款。李宁在哥哥的陪同下带着2万多元捐款来到北京解放军总医院。
    尽管李宁的费用不足，但医院还是先收下了她。医护人员给李宁制订了周密的手术治疗方案。由于他们高超的医术，在大剂量放疗、化疗和骨髓移植术后，李宁竟奇迹般地没有高烧、没有交叉感染和移植物抗宿的反应。术后第23天，李宁的血象就恢复了正常，手术非常成功。出院时，李宁和哥哥握着医生护士的手泪流满面，许久许久说不出话来。
    患慢性紫癜性肾炎4年多的北京工人田建民急需做肾移植。在一时难以凑足手术所需数万元费用而先后被几家地方医院拒之门外后，其父心急如焚。万般无奈之际，在大年初一来到北京市委上访，陈希同市长听完患者家属的哭诉后，当即写了一封信，并让他带着孩子去找解放军总医院。田建民入院后，很快接受了第一次肾移植手术，但因术后出现了超级排异反应，不得已，3天后又将移植肾摘除，而仅以血液透析维持患者的生命。今年2月，该院泌尿外科为田建民成功地施行了第二次肾移植手术，并为有特殊困难的田建民减免了医药费6000余元。身体康复后的田建民由衷地说：“是共产党、解放军给了我第二次生命！”
    这些年来，总医院挽救了多少个李宁、田建民，医护人员已经记不清了。不少患者出于感激，偷偷给医护人员送礼物，递红包，但都被婉言谢绝。全院去年退回的人民币、港币、金项链等礼品价值逾万元。
    一位患者感慨地说：“在中国，还有这么一块不向钱看的净土。解放军医院的医护人员不仅医术精湛，而且医德高尚，他们有一颗金子般闪光的心！”
      这里的大门向世界敞开着
    几年前，以院长梁国章为首的院领导和专家教授大胆提出医院要向世界敞开大门。现在，他们不仅与美国、日本、法国、意大利、荷兰、瑞士、香港等十几个国家和地区有着广泛的学术交流，而且把大批骨干送出国学习、进修，为军队医院培养了一批又一批人才。
    说来也有意思，不少外国朋友了解总医院，都是从住院的亲身经历中体验的。一天，意大利驻华大使因病住进了该院。这位熟悉中国的大使发现这个军队医院的技术水平、服务态度大大优于北京的其它医院。感叹之余，他向正在选择卫生援助对象的本国政府汇报了以上情况。于是，意大利政府决定无偿为总医院提供465万美元的先进急救设备，并接受该院70名医护人员分批去意大利学习。
    全国人大常委霍英东先生从香港来京开会，偶染小恙到解放军总医院诊治。当他了解到该院在经费困难的情况下，每年仍拿出20余万元为一些经济困难的患者减免医药费时，霍英东先生十分感动。他当即决定向该院赠送一台目前世界上最先进的结石破碎机。今年，他又向该院捐赠30万美元用于购买机器配套设备。
    从1984年起，有近500位在国际医学界名望很高的专家教授来总医院进行学术交流和参观访问。其中，有89位专家被该院聘为名誉教授、技术顾问。这些专家或定期来院讲学，或为该院出国进修人员提供经费，或向该院提供最新医学资料。通过学术交流，总医院的学术研究最新成果也不断被介绍给世界。该院的10多位专家教授还被国外学术机构聘为学术委员。
    总医院除了派出百余位专家、学者出国参观、访问、考察外，还有近百人出国攻读学位和进修学习，现已有60多人已学成回国，大多数人在临床和科研方面发挥了突出作用。主治医生刘国树先后在比利时、西德进修，不到一年就通过了博士论文答辩。他在北京刚刚平息反革命暴乱后毅然回到总医院。
      “对外开放使医院面貌发生了根本的变化。”梁国章院长说：“最近，军委主席邓小平说改革开放的政策不变，我们军队医务工作者备受鼓舞。继续对外开放，国家就大有希望。”
        竭尽全力为祖国分忧
    床位紧张、经费困难……所有医院面临的矛盾几乎无一例外地摆在总医院领导面前。此外，军队医院要在改革开放的年代有所作为，更有一些特殊困难。57岁的少将梁国章作为医院的“当家人”，对此体会尤深。他说：“总医院不仅有繁重的医疗任务，还担负部分中央和军委领导的保健任务，医院的工作出不得半点差错。这些年来，我这个当院长的天天都有如履薄冰之感。”
    经费不足是最大的困难。每年，上级下拨的经费不到医院所需数额的1／3。没钱不能购买药品器材，更不能增添设备或改善工作条件。党委提出，既要为民解难，更要为国分忧。在国家经济困难的情况下，他们一不伸手向上要，二不从患者身上多收费、乱收费，而是充分发挥技术优势，办起了化妆品厂等10余个工厂，走出一条以副养医的路子。
    几年来，医院党委既注重经济效益，更注重社会效益，制订了一系列文明行医的原则。有危重病人送来，一律先挽救病人而不是先要钱。这家医院不仅从未发生开大处方、该收治而拒收病人等丑闻，还千方百计收治疑难、危重病人。虽然门诊量、收治量大大增加，技术水平和医疗质量却不断提高，床位周转、治愈率达历史最高水平，而医疗事故率则下降到历史最低点。1985和1988两年，没有一起医疗事故发生。不仅如此，医护人员还结合临床开展科学研究，该院在5年中共获国家、军队科技成果一、二、三等奖262项。最近，中央军委和总后首长都对总医院的工作予以充分的肯定。
