Li Peng Meets with Bista
Hopes for Further Development of Sino-Nepalese Friendly Neighborly Relations

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 13th — Premier Li Peng met with former Nepalese Prime Minister Bista and his wife on the 12th here.

    Li Peng extended a warm welcome to the old friends from the neighboring country and expressed his appreciation and gratitude for Bista's contributions to the development of Sino-Nepalese friendly cooperation during his tenure as Nepal's Foreign Minister and Prime Minister.

    Li Peng, recalling the history of Sino-Nepalese friendship, said, "China and Nepal are close neighbors and both are developing countries. Over the past 34 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have always respected and assisted each other, and bilateral relations have developed smoothly. In international affairs, we have always cooperated and have many common languages. We hope that the friendly neighborly relations between China and Nepal will be further consolidated and developed."

    When discussing the situation in South Asia, Li Peng said, "We sympathize and understand the difficulties faced by Nepal. We hope that Nepal and India, the two neighboring countries, can resolve their existing problems through friendly consultations and negotiations."

    Li Peng said, "China is willing to improve and develop relations with India on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but the improvement of Sino-Indian relations will not harm the existing friendly relations between China and other South Asian countries, including Nepal."

    Premier Li Peng asked Bista to convey greetings from the Chinese leadership to the Nepalese leadership upon his return home.

    Bista is a well-known politician in Nepal who has long been dedicated to the cause of Sino-Nepalese friendship. This is his ninth visit to China.

    李鹏在回顾中尼友谊发展历程时说，中尼两国是近邻，又都是发展中国家，建交34年来，两国政府和人民一贯互相尊重，互相帮助，双边关系发展顺利，在国际事务中也一贯互相合作，有很多共同语言。我们希望中尼两国的友好睦邻关系进一步得到巩固和发展。
    在谈到南亚形势时，李鹏说，对尼泊尔面临的困难，我们是同情和理解的，希望尼泊尔和印度两个邻国通过友好协商和谈判，妥善地解决彼此间存在的问题。
    李鹏说，中国愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同印度改善和发展关系，但中印关系的改善不会损害中国同其他南亚国家包括尼泊尔业已存在的友好关系。
