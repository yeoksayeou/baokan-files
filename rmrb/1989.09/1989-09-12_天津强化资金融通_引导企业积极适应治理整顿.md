Tianjin Strengthens Financial Coordination to Guide Enterprises in Adapting to Rectification and Restructuring

Tianjin, September 12th (Reported by Xiao Di): Tianjin Municipal Government has taken concrete measures to strengthen financial coordination, alleviate the shortage of funds, and guide enterprises to look inward and downward, adopting a proactive attitude to adapt to rectification and restructuring.

The tightness of working capital and slow turnover is a prominent contradiction in Tianjin's economic work. To solve this problem, Tianjin Municipal Government, with Zhang Lichang, the Deputy Mayor, presiding, holds a meeting with bank presidents every week for coordination. Zhang Lichang pointed out: In the process of rectification and restructuring, Tianjin's enterprises face two attitudes towards financial difficulties: one is to fight to the end, overcome difficulties, and focus on potential, adapting to market needs to adjust product structure, creating new levels in fund management, striving to achieve less occupation, faster turnover, and better benefits. The other is to wait passively, hoping for "relaxed" conditions to come early. On this issue, early recognition and early initiative are better; late recognition means more passivity. It should be known that the shortage of funds will not change significantly in the short term, and rectification and restructuring will not be abandoned halfway. Enterprises should strive to achieve new levels in a tight situation.

At the same time, Tianjin Municipality has taken six measures to alleviate the shortage of funds:

	— Actively reduce inventory, activate finished product funds, adopt flexible methods, and strengthen sales work.
	— Organize specialized forces to actively collect accounts receivable. Various specialized banks cooperate with corresponding commissions and bureaus to focus on breaking through large arrears.
	— Adjust the credit structure, ensure key needs, and banks should focus on supporting backbone enterprises, popular products, and the production of necessities for people's lives.
	— Mobilize the masses extensively, do a good job in internal potential tapping, and reduce fund occupation.
	— Strictly manage funds and block various loopholes.
	— Comprehensive departments do a good job in services, helping enterprises to get through difficulties.

　　天津强化资金融通
　　引导企业积极适应治理整顿
    本报天津9月12日电　记者肖荻报道：天津市采取切实措施强化资金融通工作，缓解资金紧缺状况，引导企业眼睛向内，手心向下，以积极态度适应治理整顿。
    流动资金紧张、周转不灵是天津经济工作中一个突出矛盾。为解决这一问题，天津市政府由常务副市长张立昌主持，每周召开一次银行行长会进行协调。张立昌指出：在治理整顿中，天津企业界面对资金困难有两种态度：一种是背水一战，迎难而上，立足挖潜，适应市场需要调整产品结构，创出资金管理新水平，力争做到占用少、周转快、效益好。另一种是消极等待，幻想“宽松”条件早日到来。在这个问题上早认识，早主动，晚认识，就更被动。应知，资金短缺不会在短时期有大的变化，治理整顿不会半途而废。企业应在过紧日子中逼出新水平。
    与此同时，天津市在缓解资金紧缺问题上采取6条措施：
    ——大力压缩库存，搞活成品资金，采取灵活办法，强化销售工作。
    ——组织专门力量，积极催收货款。各专业银行与对口委局配合，重点突破拖欠大户。
    ——调整信贷结构，保证重点需要，银行要重点支持骨干企业、畅销产品、人民生活必需品生产。
    ——广泛发动群众，搞好内部挖潜，减少资金占压。
    ——严格资金管理，堵塞各种漏洞。
    ——综合部门搞好服务，帮助企业渡过难关。
