	Jiang Zemin and Sun Sang-pil Emphasize Further Development of Sino-North Korean Traditional Friendship

	Beijing, September 19 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yuqing reports: This afternoon at 3 PM, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with a delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, led by Vice Chairman Sun Sang-pil, at Zhongnanhai.

	The delegation from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea arrived in China on September 6 at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for a friendly visit.

	Jiang Zemin said that China and North Korea have a traditional and solid friendship. The Chinese people highly value this friendship. China will always support the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country.

	Jiang Zemin also said that while insisting on reform and opening up, we must be highly vigilant against the infiltration of decadent bourgeois ideology. China will continue to adhere to the principle of one central task and two basic points.

	Sun Sang-pil said that during their visits to Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong, they felt the deep and solid friendship between the peoples of the two countries, forged in blood. The Party, government, and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will spare no effort in the future to further develop this friendship. He also said that during their visit, they saw the tremendous achievements China has made in the past 40 years, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. This shows that the series of policies and guidelines formulated by the Communist Party of China are correct.

	Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Hab Comin, was present at the meeting.
