The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to commence an audit and registration process starting this September for non-postal and telecommunications entities engaging in postal and telecommunications services. This move aims to further regulate and manage the postal and telecommunications market, thereby protecting the legal rights of users.

It has been noted that in recent years, the number of non-postal and telecommunications entities and individuals engaging in postal and telecommunications services has significantly increased. However, each postal and telecommunications service requires comprehensive network coordination and joint operations. The construction of postal and telecommunications facilities necessitates unified planning; the market requires unified management; and technical systems and business policies must be uniformly established. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a thorough audit and rectification of non-postal and telecommunications entities engaging in postal and telecommunications services.

The audit and registration scope determined by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications includes:
1. Entities utilizing dedicated communication facilities to provide services to users outside their own department.
2. Broadcast and television systems providing services to users outside their own system.
3. Non-postal and telecommunications entities or individuals engaging in wireless paging, mobile communications, dispatch services, postal express delivery, and other postal and telecommunications services.

This audit and registration work will be carried out by the postal and telecommunications management bureaus of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, in conjunction with the local industrial and commercial administrative management bureaus. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will conduct the final approval. The re-audit and registration process will be completed by the end of the year.

    非邮电部门邮电业务  邮电部决定审查登记
    本报讯　邮电部决定从今年9月起，对非邮电部门经营邮电业务的进行审查登记，以进一步整顿和管理好邮电的经营市场，维护用户的合法权益。
    据介绍，近年来，非邮电部门经营邮电业务的单位和个人明显增多。但是，邮电的每一项业务都需要全程全网和联合作业，邮电的设施建设需要统一规划；经营市场需要统一管理；技术体制、业务政策要统一制定。因此，对非邮电部门经营邮电业务要进行重新审查和整顿。
    邮电部确定审查登记范围是：利用专用通信设施为本部门以外的用户提供服务的；广播电视系统的通信设施为本系统以外用户提供服务的；非邮电部门的单位或个人经营无线寻呼、移动通信、电召、邮政速递以及其他邮电通信业务的。
    这项审查登记工作由各省、自治区、直辖市邮电管理局会同同级工商行政管理局进行，由邮电部最后审批。重新审查登记工作将于年底结束。
