Why Did He Succeed in Black-Market Fertilizer Sales?

In Shuidianhe Town, Liangjia Village, of our county, the village head and Communist Party member Liang Liuhua, from July to September 1988, engaged in black-market sales of 72.85 tons of potassium chloride on 11 occasions, with an illegal turnover of over 47,800 yuan and personal illegal income of 5,298 yuan. This case involved 8 production material supply and marketing departments within and outside the county, and 27 state cadres and staff. How did Liang Liuhua, a village head from a remote mountain village, manage to operate freely in the production material supply and marketing sector and succeed repeatedly?

Some party members and cadres forget their duties for personal gain. In early August last year, Liang Liuhua, in collusion with a deputy director of a supply and marketing cooperative, went to the county production material company to purchase fertilizer. The director of the county production material company agreed to sell 7 tons of potassium chloride. After Liang and the deputy director discussed, they each gave the director and deputy director of the county production material company 200 yuan and 100 yuan in cash. The next day, the company director, without saying a word, changed the 7 tons of potassium chloride voucher to 15 tons of potassium chloride and 2 tons of urea. They transported the 15 tons of potassium fertilizer to Jishou and sold it for a profit of 3,030 yuan. Tasting success, Liang Liuhua then gave 6 key figures a total of 1,700 yuan in "hard work fees" and "information fees," and purchased an additional 37.5 tons of fertilizer for resale, illegally profiting 2,770 yuan.

Rules are ignored, and violations are known. Fertilizer is a controlled production material. Relevant departments have clearly stipulated that without approval, fertilizer is not allowed to be transported out of the region. Except for supply and marketing cooperatives and production material departments, no other departments or individuals are allowed to engage in fertilizer sales; buying and selling for profit and middleman speculation are strictly prohibited. However, Liang Liuhua engaged in black-market sales of fertilizer 11 times, selling 4 times to other counties and 7 times to other provinces. Despite the state and county government's directives, the fertilizer was still transported out of the region without obstruction.

Relationships are valued over principles. In Shuidianhe Town's supply and marketing cooperative, a fellow villager of Liang Liuhua's once obtained 20.5 tons of fertilizer. Over three months, he purchased a total of 50 tons of fertilizer from five nearby supply and marketing cooperatives through his fellow villagers, acquaintances, and relatives. In early July this year, Liang Liuhua was expelled from the party and sentenced to three years in prison. Four economic criminals and five bribe-takers involved in the Liang case also received appropriate punishments. However, the lessons left by this case are far more profound than the case itself.

　　他倒卖化肥为何得手
    我县水田河镇梁家村村长、共产党员梁留华，从1988年7月至9月，11次倒卖氯化钾72.85吨，非法经营额达47800余元，个人非法收入5298元。此案涉及县内外的8个生产资料供销部门，27名国家干部、职工。梁留华，一个深山沟里的农民村长，何以能畅行于生产资料供销领域，而连连得手呢？
    个别党员干部见利忘义。去年8月上旬，梁留华伙同某供销社副主任到县生产资料公司购买化肥。县生产资料公司一经理答应卖给7吨氯化钾。梁和那位副主任商议后，便给县生产资料公司正、副经理分别送去200元和100元现金。第二天，公司经理二话没说，即将7吨氯化钾的批条改换成了15吨氯化钾和2吨尿素。他们将15吨钾肥运到吉首，转手倒卖，非法牟利3030元。梁留华尝到了甜头，于是，又先后送给6名实权人物辛苦费、信息费1700元，同时套购化肥37.5吨转手倒卖，非法获利2770元。
    有章不循、明知故犯。化肥是专营的生产资料。有关部门曾明确规定：未经批准，化肥不准自行外运，除供销社和生产资料部门经营化肥外，其他任何部门和个人均不得经营；不准倒买倒卖、中间盘剥。而梁留华11次倒卖化肥，4次卖给外县，7次卖给外省。州、县政府行文之后，仍是畅通无阻地运往外地。
    讲关系，不讲原则。梁留华在水田河镇供销社工作的一位同乡手里，一次就搞到20.5吨化肥。3个月里，他在邻近的5个供销社的同乡、熟人、亲戚手中共套购化肥50吨。今年7月上旬，梁留华被开除党籍，并被判处有期徒刑3年。与梁案有牵连的4名经济罪犯和5名受贿者，也分别得到了应有的处理。然而，此案留给人们的教训却比案件本身深刻得多。湖南保靖县纪委　张象刚
