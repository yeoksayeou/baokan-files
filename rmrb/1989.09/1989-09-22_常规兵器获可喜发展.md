Conventional weapons have seen significant progress. According to a report from our newspaper, military equipment production enterprises in the three northeastern provinces have, in the tide of reform and opening up, adhered to the principle of serving national defense construction. They have timely provided the troops with advanced, high-quality, and sufficient conventional weapons and equipment, ensuring the needs of the troops' war preparedness and training.

The military equipment production enterprises in Northeast China are the backbone of conventional weapons and equipment production in our country. In recent years, these enterprises have, on the basis of strengthening national defense education for their workers, leveraged their technological advantages to focus on weapon production. A certain military factory is the main base for the production of large-caliber artillery in our country. After implementing internal economic accounting, the factory has concentrated its core forces on artillery research and production. They have overcome six major technical difficulties and more than 60 quality control issues, successfully developing and producing several new types of large-caliber artillery and self-propelled artillery.

Choosing the path of military-civilian integration and using civilian production to support military needs is an important decision made by military equipment production enterprises in Northeast China to serve the overall national defense construction. Over the decades, the First Automobile Works has produced more than 200,000 military transport vehicles for the People's Liberation Army. In recent years, to change the backward state of the army's logistics transportation vehicles, they successfully developed a new type of civilian Liberator truck. They then organized technical personnel to continuously tackle key technical problems, sent personnel to the troops to gather opinions, and finally, under the guidance of the General Logistics Department and the military representative stationed at the factory, successfully developed a 5-ton military high-sided transport vehicle. These vehicles were gradually equipped to the troops by the end of last year, ending the 30-year history of the army using the same type of vehicle.

Military fuel is praised as the lifeblood of modern warfare. A certain refinery in Liaoxi has vigorously carried out scientific research and development, developing multiple new types of military fuels. Among them, the newly developed cold-region vehicle oil is a replacement product for the army's cold-region matching fuel.

    常规兵器获可喜发展
    本报讯　东北三省军品生产企业，在改革开放的大潮中，牢记为国防建设服务的宗旨，及时为部队提供了性能先进，质量优良，数量充足的常规武器装备，保证了部队战备训练的需要。
    东北军品生产企业，是我国常规武器装备生产的骨干企业。近年来，这些企业在对职工加强国防教育的基础上，发挥技术优势，抓好武器生产。某军工厂是我国生产大口径火炮的主要基地。该厂实行内部经济核算后，仍集中骨干力量，用于火炮研制生产，先后攻克6大技术难关和60多项质量控制课题，研制生产出几种新型大口径火炮和自行火炮。
    走军民结合、以民养军之路，是东北地区军品生产企业服从国防建设大局的一个重要抉择。几十年来，中国第一汽车制造厂，为我军生产了20多万辆军用运输车。近年来，为了改变我军后勤交通运输工具落后的状况，他们在成功地研制出民用新型解放车后，积极组织技术人员攻关不辍，并派人深入部队征求意见，终于在总后车船部和驻厂军代表的指导下，研制成功5吨军用高栏运输车，于去年底陆续装备部队，结束了我军用车辆30年一贯制的历史。
    军用油料被誉为现代战争的血液。辽西某炼油厂大力开展科研攻关活动，研制出多种新的军用油料，其中新近研制成功的寒区汽车油，是我军寒区配套油料的换代产品。
