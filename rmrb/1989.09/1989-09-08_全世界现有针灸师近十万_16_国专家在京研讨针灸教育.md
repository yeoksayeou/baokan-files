Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 8th.

More than 100 acupuncture experts from 16 countries gathered in Beijing recently to discuss international acupuncture education. The experts noted that over the past 40 years, China's acupuncture education has been the most active field in the external promotion of traditional Chinese medicine, making significant contributions to the global spread of acupuncture.

According to incomplete statistics, in the past 10 years, the three international acupuncture training centers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing have trained over 1,500 acupuncturists for 120 countries and regions.

The conference revealed that there are approximately 40,000 people worldwide who specialize in acupuncture. Including those who provide "part-time services," the total number is close to 100,000. However, fewer than one-third of these have received systematic education and have a solid foundation in basic medical knowledge.
