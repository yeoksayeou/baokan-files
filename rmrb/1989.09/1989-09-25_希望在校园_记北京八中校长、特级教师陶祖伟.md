Here, there is his affection, his love, his youth, and the historical responsibility. After 37 years of teaching, Tao Zuyi is still immersed in the high school campus.

A Letter

In 1984, at the age of 51, Tao Zuyi was appointed as the principal of Beijing No. 8 Middle School. Just as he was deep in thought about how to start the reform of secondary school education, he received a letter from a student who had just been admitted to Tsinghua University. The letter said: When I recall my high school days, I am filled with love for my alma mater and teachers, and even thinking of the teachers' hard work and hardships makes me cry. But I am also filled with hatred, hatred for the loss of so much in my high school days: youth, friendship, hobbies, and vitality...

Holding this letter, Tao Zuyi's thoughts surged. No. 8 Middle School is a key middle school in Beijing, with a high admission rate every year, yet the beneficiary students would have such hatred. This hatred made him realize that students need not only an ideal university but also a beautiful youth and the free, full, and comprehensive development of personality.

Principal Tao announced his reform ideas and plans at the Teachers' Congress. In addition to the prescribed curriculum, No. 8 Middle School added five courses: computer science, English typing, scientific photography, electrical maintenance, and sewing. It established a choir, track and field team, and wind band, and regularly held science festivals, art festivals, and sports festivals within the school.

At first, some people shook their heads. Once, during the choir's practice time, a student who was supposed to be the conductor was nowhere to be found. Where did he go? Old Tao went to find him personally, only to find that the "conductor" was locked in the classroom to make up for his math lessons. A teacher nearby said, "If college entrance exams were about singing, I would let him go." Principal Tao criticized, "College entrance exams don't test eating, does that mean we don't let the kids eat!" With Principal Tao's insistence, the extracurricular classes at No. 8 Middle School were carried out.

Tao Zuyi advocated changing the conventional educational methods. In the past, the focus was on finding faults with students, but now the focus should be on developing students' strengths, using strengths to compensate for weaknesses, and avoiding weaknesses. As a result, the admission rate did not decrease, and students also developed in multiple ways.

Forward-Thinking Consciousness

That year, during a visit to Japan, Tao Zuyi asked a colleague in Tokyo, "What is your goal in cultivating students?"

The response was: "To cultivate international talents who can adapt to the future era."

Hearing this, Tao Zuyi was deeply moved and realized that China's recognition of the need for education to be forward-thinking was lagging behind. Upon returning to the school, he told the teachers, "The coordinates of education should also be four-dimensional. It's not enough to have length, width, and height; there must also be a time indicator. Today's teaching should consider the needs of students ten years from now."

To find the right amount of advance, the school subscribed to more than 200 periodicals for everyone to read, understand, and predict the future. He also discussed with the teachers what the 21st century would be like and what kind of talents it would need. He especially emphasized improving students' qualities, not just giving them knowledge, but also teaching them methods of analysis, problem-solving, and hands-on skills. The school spent a lot of money to build a world-class laboratory and, through international exchanges, expanded the horizons of teachers and students, striving to keep up with the contemporary level of education. No. 8 Middle School maintains friendly relations with Tokyo's Toa Gakuen and New York's McHattan Technical Center in the United States.

"Two-Way Excellence"

Great teachers produce outstanding students. Tao Zuyi timely formulated the "two-way excellence" policy, that is, students produce talents, and teachers also produce talents.

In his eyes, teachers are not tools and cannot be used without cultivation. Teachers are also people with aspirations, and their personalities should be fully developed. Educating students to become talents, one must also become a talent. He used this set of talent views to carry out teacher training reforms, formulated a set of new personnel, salary, and labor systems, and implemented free job selection within the school, with the principal appointing, trying to meet everyone's requirements, and doing the work they are competent and willing to do. In teaching, different styles are allowed, and distinctive teaching styles and methods are encouraged. Whether it is inspirational or didactic, whichever method produces good students should be used. Especially for some older teachers, who have been "singing the Ma school" for many years, if they are asked to change to the "Qiu school," the more they change, the less it looks like, it is better to have a hundred flowers bloom and learn from each other.

He himself, no matter how busy, still teaches classes and studies with everyone. The philosophy textbook Tao Zuyi teaches is his own compiled teaching material. He encourages everyone to teach with research topics, produce talents, and produce results. This year, the academic papers of No. 8 Middle School teachers have won 17 awards, and more than ten monographs have been published.

For teachers who excel in teaching and research, Principal Tao does not hesitate to reappoint them, and those in their thirties are also appointed as senior teachers. The entire school has more than 20 teachers who have been appointed in an exceptional manner.

Reform has strengthened his confidence in Chinese education. Tao Zuyi's wish is to run a good school and let the younger generation catch up with the world's advanced level.

    希望在校园
    ——记北京八中校长、特级教师陶祖伟
    本报记者　魏亚南
    这里有他的情，有他的爱，有他的青春和历史的责任。37年的教学生涯，陶祖伟依旧陶醉在中学的校园里。
              一封来信
    1984年，51岁的陶祖伟被任命为北京市第八中学校长。正当他冥思苦索中等学校教育改革从何入手时，接到了一名刚刚考入清华大学的本校毕业生的来信。信中说：当我回忆中学时代的时候，充满了对母校和老师的爱，甚至一想到老师的辛勤和清苦就流泪。但我也充满了恨，恨中学时代失去得太多太多：青春、友谊、爱好和生机勃勃……
    捧着这封信，陶祖伟思绪翻腾。八中是北京市的重点中学，每年升学率都很高，岂料受益的学生竟会有恨。这恨使他领悟到，学生需求的不仅是一所理想的大学，还需要美好的青春及个性自由、充分、全面的发展。
    陶校长在教代会上宣布了他的教改思路和方案。除了规定的教学内容外，八中又开了5门课：电子计算机、英文打字、科技摄影、电器维修和缝纫，成立了合唱队、田径队和管乐队，还定期在校内过科技节、艺术节和体育节。
    开始，有人对此摇头晃脑。一次，合唱队到了练习时间，一位担任总指挥的学生干等不来。他干什么去了？老陶亲自去找，原来“总指挥”被关在教室里补数学课呢。在一旁的老师说：“上大学若是考唱歌，我就让他去。”陶校长批评道：“上大学不考吃饭，难道也不让孩子吃饭！”在陶校长的坚持下，八中的课外课搞起来了。
    陶祖伟主张改变习以为常的教育方法，以往专挑学生毛病，现在要发展学生特长，以长补短，扬长避短。这样一来，升学率不但没下降，学生还得到了多方面的发展。
              超前意识
    那年，去日本考察，陶祖伟向东京一位同行问道：“你们培养学生的目标是什么？”
    回答：“适应未来时代的国际型人才。”
    闻此，陶祖伟怦然心动，意识到我国在教育必须超前的认识上是落后的。回到学校，他对老师们说：“教育的座标也应当是四维的，光有长宽高不行，还要有时间指标。今天的教学要想到学生十几年后的需要。”
    为了找准这个提前量，学校订了200多种报刊，供大家阅读，了解和预测将来。他还和老师们共同探讨21世纪会是什么样子，需要什么样的人才，他特别强调提高学生素质，不止给学生知识，还要教会分析、解决问题的方法和动手能力。学校不惜重金修建了具有世界一流水平的实验室，并通过国际交往，开拓师生视野，力求与当代教育水平同步发展。八中同日本东京的东亚学园和美国纽约的麦哈顿技术中心保持着友好关系。
            “双　向　成　才”
    名师出高徒。陶祖伟适时地制订了“双向成才”的方针，即学生出人才，教师也出人才。
    在他眼里，教师不是工具，不能光使用不培养，教师也是具有上进心的人，个性也要得到充分发展。教育学生成才，自己也要成才。他用这一套人才观进行教师培养的改革，制订了一套全新的人事、工资、劳动制度，还在校内实行工作自由选择，由校长聘任，尽量满足每个人的要求，做自己胜任并愿意做的工作。教学上允许有不同风格，提倡教风、教法自成一格。不论启发式还是灌输式，哪套方法能出好学生就用哪一套。特别是一些老年教师，多年“唱马派”，要他改“裘派”，越改越不像，不如来个百花齐放，互相切磋。
    他自己再忙也要教课，同大家一起钻研业务。陶祖伟讲的哲学课本，就是他自己编的教材。他鼓励大家带着研究课题教学，出人才，出成果。今年，八中教师的学术论文，得奖的就有17篇，还出版了十几部专著。
    对于教学和科研突出的教师，陶校长不拘一格重聘，30多岁也一样被聘任为高级教师。全校破格聘任的教师有20多位。
    改革坚定了他对中国教育的信心。陶祖伟的心愿就是办好学校，让后代赶上世界先进水平。
