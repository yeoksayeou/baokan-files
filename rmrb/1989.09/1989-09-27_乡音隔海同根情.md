The opera *A World Apart*, based on the same-named film script, was performed by the Gansu Opera Troupe. The opera, written by Wang Zhi and Gao Ping, composed by Bao Xueliang, and directed by Chen Gongjie, was a standout at the second China Arts Festival.

The opera is set in Gansu and tells the story of a Gansu folk singer who travels to Taiwan via Southeast Asia to find her father. It expresses the deep sorrow and longing between family members who are separated by what feels like an insurmountable distance, and it narrates the profound pain of national division until the country is reunified. It is a tragic play with deep emotional content, stirring the soul, and touching the heart with its rich local flavor and national style. It is also a significant play that promotes national unity and inspires the shared emotions of those with the same roots and the same accent. The play deeply reveals the strong desire of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to yearn for their homeland and loved ones and to long for national reunification. The story is concise, the characters are vivid, and the local flavor is strong. It does not rely on shocking events or complicated plot twists but instead uses music to explore the inner conflicts of the characters, revealing their spiritual world, moving the audience with emotion, and winning them over with emotion. The high and resonant "Flower Songs" are moving and memorable, leaving the audience with a lasting impression. For example, in the fourth scene, the play, with its grand scale and delicate brushstrokes, vividly portrays the "Homeland Association" where fellow countrymen sing a poem left by Yu Youren in Taiwan: "Bury me on the high mountains, look at my mainland, the mainland cannot be seen, only tears. Bury me on the high mountains, look at my hometown, the hometown cannot be seen, forever cannot forget." At this moment, the characters and the audience's hearts communicate almost to the point of forgetting themselves, giving the audience a tremendous impact.

The music of *A World Apart* is unique in its selection and design, with a strong local flavor and national style. First, in the selection of musical materials, it highlights the "Flower Songs" of Gansu, which are popular among the people of the northwest. Using "Flower Songs" as the main melody and incorporating the tunes of Qin Opera, Long Opera, and Bowl Opera, it enriches the musical creation of the play and plays a crucial role in shaping the musical image of the characters. The entire play is interwoven with the melody of the "Flower Song" *Going to Sichuan*, accurately and delicately expressing the urgent desire of the Taiwanese military and civilians to return to their motherland, as well as their boundless love for the Yellow River, their hometown, and their country.

The music uses the artistic techniques of accompaniment, duet, and chorus to enhance the plot, create an atmosphere, and depict the inner world of the characters, achieving a good stage effect.

If some of the performers could improve their singing skills, perhaps this play could reach even greater heights.

    乡音隔海同根情
    赵　毅
    甘肃省歌剧团根据同名电影剧本编演的民族歌剧《咫尺天涯》（王志、高平编剧，包学良作曲，陈公洁执导）是第二届中国艺术节别开生面的一朵鲜花。
    该剧取材于甘肃，通过一位甘肃女花儿歌手借道南洋去台湾寻找生父的故事，道出了骨肉间咫尺若天涯的悲怆惆怅之情，述说了祖国未统一则夙愿难偿的深沉的民族分离之苦，是一出思想内涵深沉，牵魂动魄，以情扣人而具有浓郁的地方特色和民族风格的悲剧，也是一出攸关民族大团结而又激励“同根”之情、乡音之情的正剧，深刻揭示了海峡两岸人民思念故土亲人，渴望祖国统一的强烈愿望。这出戏故事集中，人物鲜明，特色浓郁。它既无惊心动魄的重大事件，也无曲折惊险的故事情节，而是倾尽全力用音乐探求人物内心的冲突，揭示人物精神世界，以情动人，以情取胜。曲曲高亢悠扬的“花儿”，丝丝入扣，节节动人，使观众回味无穷。如第四场，剧作以宏大的气势，细腻的笔触，浓墨重彩般地宣泄了
  “同乡会”的众乡党共唱于佑任先生在台湾留下的一首遗诗：“葬我于高山之上兮，望我大陆，大陆不可见兮只有痛哭。葬我于高山之上兮，望我故乡，故乡不可见兮，永不能忘。”此时此景人物与观众心灵交流几乎达到了忘我的境界，给观众以巨大的冲击。
      《咫尺天涯》的音乐创作，从音乐选材到唱腔设计都别具一格，具有浓郁的地方特色和民族风格。首先在音乐素材的选择上突出了西北人民喜闻乐见的甘肃“花儿”。以“花儿”为基调，并吸收了秦腔、陇剧、碗碗腔的音调，丰富了该剧的音乐创作思路，对塑造人物音乐形象上起到了画龙点睛的作用。全剧以“花儿”《下四川》的旋律贯穿，准确而细腻地表现了台湾军民盼望回归祖国的迫切心情，以及对陇原、黄河、家乡，对祖国的无限爱恋之情。
    音乐运用伴唱、重唱、合唱的艺术手段，对烘托剧情，渲染气氛，剖画人物内心世界，起到了良好舞台效果。
    如参演的一些演员能在歌唱素质上再下一些功夫，也许此剧能更上一层楼。
