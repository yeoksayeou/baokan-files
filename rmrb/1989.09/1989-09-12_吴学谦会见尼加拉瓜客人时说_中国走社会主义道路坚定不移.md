Vice Premier Wu Xueqian today said that China's resolve to follow the socialist path is unshakable during a meeting with Nicaraguan guests.

Wu Xueqian met with members of the National Directorate of the Sandinista National Liberation Front of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Minister of Foreign Cooperation, Henry Ruiz, and his delegation this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

Wu Xueqian said that the problems encountered in the current reforms of socialist countries are inevitable. However, the purpose of the reforms is to strengthen the socialist system. Wu Xueqian said that some socialist countries are facing difficulties in their reforms, and some Western countries are trying to use these difficulties to change their socialist direction. He said that in the face of such a situation, if the party and government of each socialist country have this vigilance and the determination to firmly follow the socialist path, socialist countries will demonstrate the superiority of their system.

Ruiz said that visiting China on the eve of the National Day of the People's Republic of China helps to gain a firsthand understanding of the situation in China, which is very beneficial.

Before the meeting, Vice Premier Wu Xueqian attended the signing ceremony of the cultural agreement between the Chinese government and the Nicaraguan government.

After the meeting, Wu Xueqian hosted a banquet in honor of Ruiz and his delegation.
