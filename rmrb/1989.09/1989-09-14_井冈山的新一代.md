The armed police unit in Jian, Jiangxi Province, uses the living classroom of Jinggangshan to guide its officers and soldiers to recall the "Jinggang" tradition and strive for hardship and entrepreneurship. Liu Jifu, the mayor of Jinggangshan City, praised them as "the new generation of successors to the Jinggang spirit."

The Jian unit, in response to the view of some people in society that hard work and struggle are outdated, uses Jinggangshan as a classroom to conduct traditional education. Officers and soldiers see the straw beds, gold-threaded quilts, oil lamps used by the Red Army in the Red Army's former residence, and the pumpkins, wild vegetables, and "Jude's shoulder pole" in the museum, witnessing the harsh conditions of the Red Army's struggle in the past. They feel the spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship of the old revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong and Zhu De from Huangyangjie, Maoping, Sanwan, and Baijiaolou. They have successively carried out a series of traditional education activities such as "Adding Glory to Jinggang" and "Striving to Be the New Generation of Jinggang." Recently, the superior leadership saw that the unit's jeeps were old and allocated more than 80,000 yuan to buy a small car, but the unit's leaders used this money to buy two Dongfeng trucks for developing agricultural and sideline production and solving basic transportation. Due to adhering to thrift, they have repaid nearly 100,000 yuan in overspending from previous years within two years.

Sharing joys and sorrows with the people of Jinggang, alleviating the burden of the old revolutionary base areas, and contributing more to the people is the common voice of all officers and soldiers in the unit. Last year, the company guarding the 1,000-meter-high mountain of Jinggangshan City moved to a new barracks without any activity space, and had to fetch water from the mountain below. They did not ask the government for help but took the initiative to excavate 3,600 cubic meters of soil on the mountain slope to build a basketball court, training room, machine room, vegetable garden, and pigsty, and repaired 260 pieces of equipment, saving nearly 100,000 yuan. Now the company is well-equipped, with flowers and trees, and they eat self-grown vegetables and self-drawn mountain spring water. Although the conditions are harsh, the officers and soldiers have excellently completed various tasks and have been rated as an advanced collective by the brigade for 11 consecutive years.

　　井冈山的新一代
　　刘志坚　刘平
    守卫在江西省井冈山地区的武警吉安支队用井冈山这一活生生的课堂，引导官兵追忆“井冈”传统，艰苦创业。井冈山市市长刘积福赞扬他们是“新一代的井冈精神继承人。”
    吉安支队针对社会上一些人艰苦奋斗“过时了”的看法，以井冈山为课堂，进行传统教育。干部、战士从红军故居睡的稻草、盖的“金丝被”、用的油灯和博物馆里的秋茄子、南瓜、野菜、“朱德的扁担”，看到了当年红军艰苦斗争的条件；从黄洋界、茅坪、三湾、八角楼感受到毛泽东、朱德等老一辈革命家艰苦创业的精神。他们相继开展了“我为井冈添光辉”、“争当井冈新一代”等系列传统教育活动。前不久，上级领导机关看到支队的吉普车破旧，便拨款8万多元供购买小轿车用，支队领导却拿这笔钱买了两辆东风牌卡车，用于发展农副业生产和解决基层运输。由于坚持勤俭持家，他们两年内还把前几年超支的钱近10万元全部还清。
    与井冈人民同甘苦，共患难，尽力减轻老区人民的负担，为人民多作贡献，是这个支队全体官员的共同心声。去年底，守卫在千米山腰的井冈山市中队搬迁到新营房后，没有任何活动场地，吃水要到山下挑，他们不向政府伸手，自己动手在山坡上挖土方3600多立方，筑起了篮球场、练功房、机械场及菜地、猪圈等，修补营具260多件，共节约经费近万元。如今中队设施齐全，花红树绿，吃上了自种蔬菜和自引的山泉水。虽然条件艰苦，官兵们却出色地完成各项任务，连续11年被总队评为先进集体。
