The billionaire known as the "Hotel Queen," Leona Helmsley, stood in the dock of the federal district court in Manhattan, New York, yesterday, accused of tax evasion, government fraud, and other charges.

Helmsley is accused of evading $1.2 million in federal income tax. As a result, she faces a maximum sentence of 127 years in prison and a fine of $7.75 million. Two former senior managers of Helmsley were also convicted in the same case. Her 80-year-old husband, who is also charged, was excused from appearing in court due to health reasons.

The 69-year-old Helmsley owns several of the most luxurious hotels in New York and has extensive real estate holdings in other states, with a total asset value of $5 billion. The federal district court will deliver its final verdict on this case on November 14 of this year.
