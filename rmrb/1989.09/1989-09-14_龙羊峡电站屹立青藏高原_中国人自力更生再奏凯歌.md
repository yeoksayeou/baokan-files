The "dragon's head" of the Yellow River's nine bends stands the tallest dam on the mainland—the 178-meter-high Longyangxia Dam. Here, the largest single-unit water turbine generators in the country are in operation—four 320,000-kilowatt generators. There is also the largest artificial lake in the country—the 24.7 billion cubic meter Longyangxia Reservoir, and the largest gantry crane in Asia—located at the top of the dam, a 500-ton gantry crane…

In the 1940s, some foreign engineers predicted that the Longyangxia Hydroelectric Station would be "difficult to build." In the 1980s, it was called a "challenge to the world" by international dam experts. After more than a decade of struggle, the Longyangxia Hydroelectric Station now stands proudly on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, becoming the largest hydroelectric station on the Yellow River.

However, did you know that the main permanent equipment for such a large project was mostly designed and manufactured in China? Except for some electrical equipment imported from abroad, the main units, main transformers, and auxiliary equipment, as well as all the flood discharge gates, dam crest gates, and tailwater gates, were all made by Chinese hands. According to hydrology experts, the equipment of the Longyangxia Hydroelectric Station has a domestic production rate of over 90%.

### 龙羊峡电站屹立青藏高原　中国人自力更生再奏凯歌

　　龙羊峡电站屹立青藏高原
　　中国人自力更生再奏凯歌
    九曲黄河的“龙头”，屹立着大陆最高的大坝——178米的龙羊峡大坝。这里，运转着国内单机容量最大的水轮发电机组——4台32万千瓦的发电机组，有国内最大的人工湖——库容247亿立方米的龙羊水库，安放着亚洲最大的门式起重机——位于坝顶的500吨门式起重机……
    40年代，一些外国工程师预言龙羊峡水电站“难建造”。80年代，它又被国际大坝专家称为中国人民“向世界挑战的工程”。经过十多年的拚搏，龙羊峡水电站已经巍然屹立在青藏高原，成为万里黄河上最大的水电站。
    但是，你可曾知道，这样一项巨大工程的主要永久设备都是我国自行设计和制造的。除某些电器装置等是从国外引进的外，其主机、主变压器及附属设备、泄水建筑全部闸门、坝顶和尾水门机等设备都出于中国人之手。据水利专家统计，龙羊峡水电站设备国产率在90％以上。
    龙羊峡水电站——中国人自力更生的凯歌！
