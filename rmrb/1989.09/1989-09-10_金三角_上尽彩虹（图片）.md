The 10 years since the reform and opening up have been the most remarkable decade for road and bridge construction in Guangdong. By the end of last year, the total length of roads in the province had reached 53,820 kilometers, with an average of over 31 kilometers of roads per 100 square kilometers of land, ranking among the top in the country. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, up to the first half of this year, the province has built more than 1,300 new bridges, totaling over 86,000 meters in length. Now, relying on ferries to cross rivers on main roads has become a thing of the past.

　　“金三角”上尽彩虹
    改革开放的10年，是广东公路及桥梁建设成绩最显著的10年。至去年底，全省公路通车里程已达53820公里，平均每百平方公里国土有公路31公里多，居全国前列。党的十一届三中全会以后，至今年上半年，全省新建桥梁1300多座，总长86000多米。如今，主干路上靠摆渡过河已成为历史。
