Two criminals who actively participated in the riots in the Kazakh city of Novouzensk three months ago were sentenced on September 15th, according to a report by the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* on September 16th.

From June 16th to 19th, fights broke out between Caucasians and Kazakhs in Novouzensk over ethnic disputes, resulting in three deaths, 53 injuries, and over 700 people fleeing the city.

Mametkov, 22, was the instigator of the incident. He also collaborated with others to rob a truck and vandalize a store. Given his cooperative attitude in confessing, he was sentenced to four years in prison.

Shenov, another criminal, shouted provocative slogans during the riots and threw stones at police officers, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison.
