    Industry Starting from Scratch
    Electronics Industry: This is a new industry that has emerged through opening up to the outside world. Currently, it has thirteen categories and can produce nearly six hundred different products. In 1988, the province had 199 electronic factories, with industrial output value ranking seventh in the country. The production capacity for televisions, tape recorders, and electronic calculators has reached over one million units each, with color TV production reaching 920,000 units last year.

    Sugar Industry: Before liberation, Fujian's local sugar production was less than 150,000 tons per year. In 1954, Fujian built its first sugar mill in Quanzhou with a daily processing capacity of 100 tons. Currently, Fujian has 46 mechanized sugar mills with a daily processing capacity of 46,100 tons and an annual production capacity of 580,000 tons.

    Canned Food Industry: Before liberation, Fujian Province had only two canned food factories, both of which went bankrupt. After liberation, the canned food industry was rebuilt. In 1988, the total output value of the canned food industry in the province was nearly 600 million yuan, ranking first in the country. Fujian's Oshima flower brand canned food enjoys a high reputation in the international market. Currently, Fujian Province has more than 30 types of canned food for export. The quality of mushroom canned food is world-class. In 1988, Fujian's canned food exports ranked first in the country.

    Textile Industry: Over the past forty years, the industry has grown from having no spindles to having over 390,000 spindles, forming a relatively complete and technologically advanced textile industry system.

    Machinery Industry: In the early days of the country's founding, there was almost nothing. Now, a characteristic machinery industry system has gradually taken shape. Over the past decade of reform and opening up, the province has developed 1,862 new products, with four national-level and 45 ministerial-level quality products. Currently, 111 enterprises have products for export. Mindong Electric Machinery has won the national product quality gold award for two consecutive years and is known as the "Chinese Champion Electric Machinery."

　　工业从零开始
    电子工业　这是在对外开放中崛起的新兴产业。目前已拥有十三个门类、能生产近六百个品种的产品。一九八八年全省已有一百九十九家电子工厂，工业产值居全国第七位。电视机、收录机、电子计算器的生产能力已达百万部以上，其中彩电产量去年达九十二万部。
    制糖工业　解放前，福建土糖年产量不及一点五万吨。一九五四年，福建建成第一家日榨百吨的泉州糖厂。目前，福建有机制糖厂四十六家，日榨糖能力达四点六一万吨，年产糖能力五十八万吨。
    罐头工业　解放前，福建省仅有的两家罐头厂先后破产倒闭。解放后，重建罐头工业。一九八八年，全省罐头行业总产值近六亿元，居全国同行业首位。福建水仙花牌罐头在国际市场上享有盛誉。目前，福建省的罐头出口品种多达三十多种。蘑菇罐头质量达世界第一流水平。一九八八年福建出口罐头量居全国首位。
    纺织工业　四十年来，从没有一枚纱锭发展到三十九万多锭，形成了门类比较齐全、技术水平比较高的纺织工业体系。
  机械工业　建国初期几乎是一无所有，现已逐步形成有特色的机械工业体系。改革开放十年，全省开发新产品一千八百六十二项，创国优四项、部优四十五项。目前，有一百一十一个企业的产品出口。闽东电机连续两次获国家产品质量金质奖，被誉为“中国王牌电机”。
