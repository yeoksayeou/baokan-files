	Expert recommendations
	Develop tea oil resources vigorously

	The current per capita consumption of edible oil in China is only one-third of that in developed countries. As the population continues to grow and living standards improve, the demand for edible oil will gradually increase. In response to this situation, relevant experts recently proposed that we should vigorously develop China's unique tea oil tree production to alleviate the growing supply-demand gap for edible oil.

	China's tea oil resources are mainly distributed in more than ten provinces (autonomous regions) south of the Qinling Mountains. For a long time, the development of tea oil production in China has been slow, with an annual output of about 250 million jin of tea oil. In the past decade, due to the cancellation of state subsidies for tea oil production, including funds, fertilizers, and grain, the returns from planting tea oil have been meager, leading to a decline in enthusiasm among the populace for planting tea oil, and a gradual decrease in production. In some regions of Hunan and Jiangxi, which historically had self-sufficient tea oil, now have to import edible oil from other provinces each year.

	To further develop tea oil resources, relevant experts suggest the following: First, increase investment in funds and materials. Given the current limitations of the country's strength, through the collection of afforestation funds on tea oil products, implementing forestry development through forestry, and other methods and channels such as raising funds in tea oil producing areas and among the populace, jointly develop tea oil resources. Second, accelerate the promotion of advanced technology. The excellent technological achievements in increasing tea oil production, processing, and utilization should be included in the "Spark" program, and advanced technology should be quickly transformed into productive forces. Third, to mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for managing tea oil, it is appropriate to raise the purchase price of tea oil and restore the policy of awarding fertilizers and grain for tea oil purchases.

　　专家建议
　　大力开发油茶资源
    我国人均食油占有量目前仅为发达国家的1／3，今后，随着人口的不断增长和人民生活水平的不断提高，对食油的需求将会逐步增大。针对这一情况，有关专家最近提出，应大力发展我国特有的食用油茶树生产，以此缓解日趋扩大的食油供需矛盾。
    我国油茶资源主要分布在秦岭以南十多个省（区）。长期以来，我国油茶生产发展缓慢，全国常年产茶油2.5亿斤左右。近10年来，由于国家取消了对油茶生产的资金、化肥、粮食等扶持和奖售政策，种油茶收益微薄，造成群众种植油茶的积极性下降，产量逐渐减少。湖南、江西一些历史上自给有余的地区，现在每年要从外省调进食油。
    为进一步开发油茶资源，有关专家建议：第一，要增加资金、物资投入。鉴于国家目前国力有限，通过对油茶产品征收育林基金，实行以林养林，及在油茶产区和群众中集资等多种方法和途径，共同开发油茶资源。第二，加快推广先进技术，应将油茶增产、加工、利用等方面的优秀技术成果，列入“星火”计划，尽快地将先进技术转化为生产力。第三，为调动农民经营油茶的积极性，应适当提高油茶收购价格，并恢复对油茶收购奖售化肥、粮食的政策。
