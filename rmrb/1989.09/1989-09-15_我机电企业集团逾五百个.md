Over the past ten years of reform and opening up, a large number of key enterprises in China's machinery and electronics industry have actively pursued horizontal integration, forming enterprise groups with significant economies of scale. To date, nearly 30,000 enterprises have participated in various forms of economic cooperation, forming over 500 enterprise groups of different types. These groups have played a crucial role in the development of China's machinery and electronics industry.

In recent years, China's mechanical and electrical enterprise groups have continued to grow through various forms such as contracting, mergers, and mutual equity participation. This has enabled a large number of enterprises to transition from operational integration to asset integration and from cooperation in production, operations, and technology to asset integration.
