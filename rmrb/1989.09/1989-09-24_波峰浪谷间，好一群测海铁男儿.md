The Nansha Islands have belonged to China since ancient times. Although China has accumulated a large amount of data on the Nansha Islands since the Han Dynasty, due to historical reasons such as economic and technological backwardness, these data are far from meeting the needs of modern navigation and engineering construction. Even today, some of the data used by the People's Republic of China Navy regarding the Nansha Islands are still from foreign sources dating back to the 1930s and 1940s!

They, the hydrographic surveyors of a certain unit of the South Sea Fleet, shoulder the heavy historical responsibility of coming to the Nansha Islands.

During the day, they navigate small boats through the waves to build permanent position markers with cement; at night, they work on makeshift platforms in the middle of the sea, operating machines to conduct measurements around the clock. What is called a work platform is actually just a few steel stakes, a few bamboo poles, and a few wooden planks fixed on the reef, measuring only a few square meters, and without a roof to shield from the wind and rain.

Every time the sunset paints the sky, these young soldiers, mostly university graduates, in groups of three or four, armed with weapons and instruments, drive small boats away from the survey mother ship straight to the reef. Then, wading through chest-deep seawater, they climb onto the work platform, their bodies soaked and sticky. If the weather is bad and it rains, the hydrographic surveyors work from 9:00 PM until dawn the next day! The temperature difference between day and night is significant there. During the day, the sun scorches, and at night, the cold sets in. Long-term work in the sea makes stomach problems and arthritis occupational diseases among the sailors...

Despite the extremely harsh working environment, the hydrographic surveyors—these iron-willed men—laugh in the face of the thousand waves of Nansha, measuring and calculating tens of thousands of various data points, silently contributing their wisdom and youth. The large-scale sea charts of some islands and reefs in the Nansha Islands of the People's Republic of China are about to be born in the hands of the hydrographic surveyors of a certain unit of the South Sea Fleet!

### 波峰浪谷间，好一群测海铁男儿

    波峰浪谷间，好一群测海铁男儿
    南沙自古属中华。尽管从汉朝以来，我国就积累了大量有关南沙的各种资料，然而，由于经济和科技落后等种种历史原因，这些资料远远不能满足现代航海和工程建设的需要。直至今天，共和国海军用的有关南沙的资料，一部分竟仍然是外国三四十年代的旧资料！
    他们，南海舰队某部的海测兵，肩负沉重的历史责任来到了南沙。
    白天，他们在风浪里驾小艇用水泥建造永久性方位标志；夜间，他们在大海中的工作平台上通宵达旦开机测量。说是工作平台，其实只是几根钢钎、几根毛竹、几块木板固定在礁盘上的简易架子，三四平方米见方，还不能盖顶棚遮风雨。
    每当落霞满天的时候，这些大都是大学本科毕业的年轻军人，三四人一组，带着武器和仪器，驾着小艇离开测量母船直奔礁盘，然后趟着齐胸深的海水爬上工作平台，全身湿漉漉粘乎乎，干了则一身咸盐。有时天公不作美，下起雨来，海测兵们便从晚上9点多钟一直淋到翌日天亮！那儿昼夜温差很大，白天烈日灼人，夜来寒气袭人。长年在海里作业，胃病、关节炎成了水兵的职业病……
    尽管工作环境是如此恶劣，但海测兵——这些铁骨铮铮的男子汉，他们笑踏南沙千重浪，测量计算着成千上万的各种数据，默默地贡献着自己的才智和青春。中华人民共和国南沙群岛部分岛礁的大比例尺海图，即将诞生在他们——南海舰队某部测量兵的手里！（9月15日《羊城晚报》谢坚文）
