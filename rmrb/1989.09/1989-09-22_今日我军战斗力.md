In the tumultuous years of war, the sharp edge of the sword that is the People's Liberation Army was renowned worldwide. The aggressors from the United States and Japan, as well as the reactionary Kuomintang, having suffered repeated defeats, were well aware of its formidable power.

The years have passed like a river, and decades have gone by. How sharp is the edge of this sword today?

Military experts believe that the strength of an army is first measured by the precision of its command center. We fully understand the importance of the "brain" in the factors that determine an army's combat effectiveness. Over the years, through adjustments and reforms, we have made it more streamlined. At the same time, we have strengthened the training of commanders at all levels. Now, more than 67% of the officers in combat units have received advanced training in military academies, and 97.4% of the military personnel have at least a junior college education. The improvement in the knowledge level of officers has created the necessary conditions for automated command. The command centers of our army, navy, and air force have embraced computers, which have proven to be highly effective. In areas such as operational command, training simulations, document processing, data storage and retrieval, equipment strength statistics, decision-making optimization, and more, software systems with 1980s technology have been developed. Some systems have increased work efficiency by several times compared to before.

Structuralists say that the efficiency of a collective often increases with its scientific composition. This is even more true for a military unit. Over the past few decades, especially in the past 10 years, we have continuously explored the laws of future warfare, adjusted the structure of the military, and moved closer to the optimal model. We have reorganized the army groups. For the first time, the number of special forces has exceeded that of infantry, ending the historical era of "infantry as the king of the battlefield." Within the army group structure, we have formed a striking force primarily composed of armored and infantry units; a fire support force composed of artillery, air defense, and army aviation units; an operational support force composed of reconnaissance, engineering, chemical defense, meteorological, and electronic countermeasure units; and a logistics and tactical support force composed of transportation, repair, medical, pipeline, supply, and equipment teams. This has significantly enhanced our rapid response capability, combined combat capability, logistics support capability, and field survival capability.

We firmly believe that people are the most fundamental factor in combat effectiveness, but we also attach great importance to the role of weapons and equipment. We have allocated our limited military funds to the maximum extent possible to strive for the development of new weapons and equipment. Now, we have medium-range, long-range, and intercontinental missiles, tactical missiles for air defense and coastal defense, and have formed a preparation system that matches their ranges. We have a certain number of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and nuclear submarines. New main battle tanks, armored infantry fighting vehicles, new command vehicles, and rescue vehicles have become the attacking and mobile forces of our army. The self-propelled capability of fire suppression weapons, the range of artillery, and new types of ammunition have all been significantly improved over the original levels. We have dozens of different types and performance aircraft. The overall design, automation level, and shipborne electronic equipment of our ships have all seen new developments. Of course, compared to developed countries, we still have a significant gap. We are striving to catch up.

We understand the common sense that a sword will rust if it is not sharpened. Now, our army units, from individual soldiers to platoons, combined tactics to operational training, have formed a preliminary training content system, and combined combat capabilities have significantly improved. The number of fully qualified ships in the navy's fully trained fleet has increased by 7.9 times compared to 10 years ago. Joint mobile fleet long-distance training has developed to the level of long-distance, multi-type combined training. The number of long-distance voyages in the past 10 years has increased by more than 15 times compared to the past 30 years. The vast Pacific and Indian Oceans have all seen the tracks of our People's Navy. The number of first-class combat squadrons in the air force has increased significantly, reaching the "four weather" level. The number of pilots who can fly in all weather conditions has nearly doubled compared to 10 years ago. The commanders of the aviation regiments can all take to the skies for combat. The all-round combat capabilities of the airborne troops have attracted the attention of experts worldwide. The proportion of excellent launch battalions and excellent commanders in the Second Artillery Corps, and the success rate of various types of missile launches have all improved significantly. We are proud of this, but we are not satisfied with it.

Combat effectiveness is composed of many factors. As a proletarian army, we have advantages that other armies cannot match, that is, the strong leadership of the party, effective political and ideological work, the glorious traditions with strong vitality, and the high political awareness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping took charge of the work of the Military Commission, we have inherited and carried forward the excellent traditions of the party and the army's political work, continuously studied new situations, explored new problems, and insisted on taking the four cardinal principles as the foundation of building the army and educating people. We have continuously strengthened the political beliefs of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, ensuring that the gun always follows the party's command. In each and every defensive battle to protect the motherland, in each and every rescue operation to safeguard the lives and property of the state and the people, and in this year's suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, our army has fulfilled its sacred duty and submitted a qualified report to the party and the people.

    今日我军战斗力
    解军
    在战火连绵的峥嵘岁月，人民解放军这把利剑的锋芒，世人有口皆碑。美日侵略者，国民党反动派，因屡吃苦头，对她的厉害自然心里比别人更有数。
    沧海桑田，斗转星移。一晃数十年过去了，今天人民解放军这把利剑的锋芒如何？
    军事家认为，军队强不强，先看“脑袋”（指挥中枢）精不精。我们深知“脑袋”在军队战斗力要素中的分量。多少年来，我们通过调整、改革，使她越来越精干。与此同时，我们加强了各级指挥员的培训。现在，作战部队的军官已有67％以上经过了院校深造培训，全军干部97.4％有了中专以上文凭。军官知识水平的提高，为指挥自动化创造了先决条件。我陆、海、空军的各级指挥中枢，计算机登堂入室，大显神通。在作战指挥、训练模拟、文件处理、资料储存检索、装备实力统计、决策论证优化等等方面，具有80年代水平的软件系统相继问世。有的系统，较之以前提高工作效率几十倍。
    结构学家讲，一个集体的效率，往往与它的科学组合程度成正比。一个武装集团更是如此。几十年来，尤其是近10年来，我们不断摸索未来战争的规律，调整军队的结构，不断向最佳模式靠近。我们新编组了集团军。特种兵的数量第一次超过了步兵，结束了“步兵是战场之王”的历史。在集团军编成内，构成了以装甲兵、步兵为主体的突击力量；以炮兵、防空兵、陆军航空兵组成的火力支援力量；以侦察兵、工程兵、防化兵、气象兵和电子对抗部队组成的作战保障力量；以运输、修理、卫生、管线、军需、器材等专业分队组成的后勤及战术保障力量。从而使我军的快速反应能力、合成作战能力、后勤保障能力、野战生存能力等显著增强。
    我们坚信人是战斗力诸因素中的最根本的因素，但我们也非常重视武器装备的作用。我们把有限的军费最大限度地掏出来，努力研制新式武器装备。现在，我们已拥有中程、远程和洲际导弹，防空、海防等战术导弹，并已形成与射程相配套的准备体系。我们已有一定数量的原子弹、氢弹、核潜艇。新式主战坦克、装甲步战车、新式指挥车、抢救车等已成为我军的攻击力量和机动力量。压制火器的自行能力、火炮的射程、新的弹种，都在原有的基础上大幅度提高。不同类型和性能的飞机已达几十种。舰艇的总体设计、自动化程度、舰载电子设备等都有新的发展。当然，我们与发达国家比，尚有不小的差距。我们正在奋起直追。
    我们深知刀不磨会生锈的常识。现在，我陆军部队从单兵、分队、合同战术到战役训练，训练内容体系已初步形成，合同作战能力明显提高。海军全训部队合格舰只与10年前比增长了7.9倍。联合机动编队的远航训练已发展到远海多兵种合同训练水平。近10年的远航次数，比过去30年的总和增长了15倍多。浩瀚的太平洋、印度洋都留下了我人民海军的航迹。空军航空兵甲类战斗团大量增加，达到“4种气象”水平的飞行员比10年前增长了近1倍。航空兵部队的师长全部能升空作战。空降兵的全方位作战能力引起世界行家关注。第二炮兵部队的优秀发射营、优秀指挥员所占的比例，各型号导弹发射成功率都有很大提高。我们以此为骄傲，但并不以此为满足。
    战斗力是多种因素组成的。作为无产阶级军队，我们还有着别的军队无法比拟的优势，那就是，坚强的党的领导，有力的思想政治工作，具有强大生命力的光荣传统，广大官兵高度的政治觉悟等等。党的十一届三中全会以后，尤其是邓小平同志主持军委工作以来，我们继承和发扬党和军队政治工作的优良传统，不断研究新情况，探讨新问题，坚持把四项基本原则作为建军之本，育人之本，不断坚定广大官兵的政治信念，保证枪杆子永远听从党的指挥。在一次次保卫祖国的反击作战中，在一次次维护国家和人民生命财产安全的抢险救灾中，在今年制止动乱、平息北京反革命暴乱的政治风波中，我们这支军队都履行了自己神圣的职责，向党和人民交了合格的答卷。
