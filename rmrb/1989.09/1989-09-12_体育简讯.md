	The third "Awakening Lion Cup" cross-country running event will be held on September 17 at the banks of the Marco Polo Bridge. This is a traditional event in Beijing aimed at promoting patriotism among the masses, especially among young people, and to advance the popularity of long-distance running.

	The Guangdong Health and Power Company, which has donated over ten million yuan to support the Beijing Asian Games, recently collaborated with the Beijing Institute of Sports Medicine to develop a new type of sports drink—sea buckthorn sports drink. This beverage, which has excellent nutritional content and taste, has recently passed inspections by the Ministry of Light Industry and health and epidemic prevention departments. It will be supplied to the Asian Games next year.

	On September 9, a pair of Danish university students arrived at Tiananmen Square in a light off-road vehicle, completing the first leg of their car tour in China. On the 13th, they will continue their journey to the northwest, completing their cross-China trip. This activity is jointly organized by the Marco Polo Travel Agency of Denmark and the China International Travel Service.
