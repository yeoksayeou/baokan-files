The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Federated States of Micronesia, guided by the desire to enhance friendly cooperation, have engaged in friendly consultations and decided to establish formal diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level starting from September 11, 1989. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Micronesia further expands the friendly ties between China and the peoples of the Asia-Pacific region. We extend our warm congratulations on this occasion.

Located in the Caroline Islands of the Pacific, the Federated States of Micronesia was once a trust territory of the United Nations administered by the United States. Since its establishment in 1979, Micronesia has actively developed its domestic economy and sought friendly cooperation abroad, achieving a series of successes. In recent years, China and Micronesia have begun friendly exchanges. Former President Nakayama and current President Hagler of Micronesia have both visited China, and economic exchanges and personnel visits between the two countries have continued to expand. The government of the Federated States of Micronesia has clearly recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and advocates for the establishment and development of friendly cooperative relations with China based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government and people appreciate the friendly attitude and clear stance of the government of the Federated States of Micronesia.

The Chinese government has consistently advocated that in international relations, all countries, regardless of size, are equal. Countries should respect each other. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Micronesia demonstrates that as long as there is a willingness to develop relations, differences in national circumstances will not become obstacles to the development of relations. China is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

China and the Federated States of Micronesia are both part of the Asia-Pacific region. On the occasion of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Micronesia, we sincerely wish that the friendly cooperative relations established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will expand into various fields and continue to develop.

　　祝贺中密建交
    中华人民共和国政府和密克罗尼西亚联邦政府，本着增进友好合作的愿望，经过友好的商谈，决定自1989年9月11日起，两国正式建立大使级外交关系。中密建交，使中国同亚太地区人民的友好联系进一步扩大，我们对此表示热烈的祝贺。
    位于太平洋加罗林群岛的密克罗尼西亚联邦，原是联合国安理会交美国托管的太平洋岛屿托管地之一。1979年成立以来，它积极发展国内经济，对外寻求友好合作，取得了一系列的成就。近年来，中密两国开始了友好交往，密克罗尼西亚联邦前总统纳卡亚马和现任总统哈格莱尔加姆先后访问过我国，两国的经济交流和人员往来不断扩大。密克罗尼西亚联邦政府明确承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立和发展同中国的友好合作关系。中国政府和中国人民对密克罗尼西亚联邦政府的这一友好的态度和鲜明的立场表示赞赏。
    中国政府一贯主张，在国际关系中，大小国家一律平等。各国应当相互尊重。中密建交证明，只要具有相互发展关系的愿望，各国情况的不同和差异不会成为发展关系的障碍。中国愿意在相互尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则的基础上发展同各国的友好关系。
    中国和密克罗尼西亚联邦同属于亚太地区。在中密建交之际，我们衷心祝愿双方在和平共处五项原则基础上建立起来的友好合作关系将扩及各个领域，并进一步得到发展。
