Some East German citizens who had been stranded in Czechoslovakia recently returned to their homeland. East Germany praised Czechoslovakia for its principled stance.

According to a report by Czechoslovak television on the evening of the 13th, in the past two days, 290 East German citizens who had sought to emigrate to the West left the West German embassy in Czechoslovakia and returned to their homeland. These citizens left after assurances were made during a recent meeting between representatives of the two Germanys that they would not be punished upon return and would be allowed to leave legally.

The report stated that since April of this year, more than 400 East German citizens have taken refuge in the West German embassy in Czechoslovakia, seeking to emigrate to the West. As of now, 150 people are still stranded there.

The East German ambassador to Czechoslovakia praised Czechoslovakia for its principled stance in not allowing any East German citizens to leave Czechoslovakia illegally.

Czechoslovak News Agency issued a statement on the 12th saying that East Germany is a reliable ally of Czechoslovakia, and Czechoslovakia will adhere to all treaty obligations signed with it.
