Ito Urges Japanese Government to Lift Restrictions on Citizens Traveling to Beijing

The head of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentary Union delegation, Ito Seisei, who concluded his visit to China yesterday, today urged the Japanese government to lift restrictions on citizens traveling to Beijing as soon as possible and to resume the third round of yen loans to China.

Ito made the above remarks this afternoon when reporting the results of his visit to China to Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu.

Ito said that various countries are lifting their restrictions, and Japan should not worry even if it lifts them quickly. Prime Minister Kaifu basically agreed with this.

When discussing the issue of resuming the third round of yen loans to China, Ito said, "Japan's relationship with China is different from that with Europe and America," and in this regard, Japan should take the lead, even if it is just half a step ahead.

This afternoon, Ito also held talks with Foreign Minister Nakayama at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After listening to Ito's report on the results of his visit to China, Nakayama held a press conference and said that he would consult with Prime Minister Kaifu on the issue of lifting restrictions on citizens traveling to Beijing and make a decision on this basis in the near future.
