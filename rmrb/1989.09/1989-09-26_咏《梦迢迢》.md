In 1986, marking the 50th anniversary of the "Xi'an Incident." It was summer, and I was recuperating in the western suburbs of Shanghai. I thought of Zhang Xueliang, the thousand-year hero who initiated the "Double Twelfth Incident" for the sake of uniting against the invaders, and his companion in hardship, Zhao Jiexia, who were still in Taiwan without freedom of movement; I thought of the incomplete jade seal, and the country not yet unified, and I was deeply moved. Thus, I wrote the play "Dream of Distant Journey." This summer, I specially invited my old friend Ou Yang Shanzun from Beijing to Shanghai to direct it. The Shanghai People's Art Theatre will perform it in Shanghai on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Hence, I wrote four poems.

	1
	How many times did I pick up my pen and put it down,
	In the summer, confined to my home, struggling to write;
	Writing about Xi'an, my spirit soars,
	At Lin Tong, the swift news of Chiang's capture.

	2
	A dream of distant journey spans fifty autumns,
	Iron bars turn white the head of a youth;
	His heart is pure to drive away the invaders,
	He stands tall and free, a prisoner of Chu.

	3
	Her body is like white jade, her face like a flower,
	To repay her loyal heart, she destroyed her home;
	As long as the bright moon is in her heart,
	She is willing to be imprisoned to the ends of the earth.

	4
	Year after year, I fear to see the mid-autumn moon,
	Every mid-autumn, I secretly grieve;
	Looking up to the sky, I ask the bright moon,
	When will the white-haired return home?

    咏《梦迢迢》
    杜宣
    1986年，为“西安事变”50周年。是夏，蛰居上海西郊养病。想起为了团结抗战，发动“双十二”事变的千古功臣张学良和他的患难伴侣赵绮霞还在台湾，没有行动自由；想起金瓯仍缺，祖国尚未统一，感慨系之矣。因作《梦迢迢》一剧。今夏特邀老友欧阳山尊自京来沪导演。由上海人民艺术剧院于建国40周年之际在沪演出。爰得诗四首。
    一
    几番提笔几番停，夏日蜗居作苦吟；
    写到西安心气壮，临潼捷报蒋生擒。
    二
    一梦迢迢五十秋，铁窗磨白少年头；
    丹心只为驱强虏，坦荡从容作楚囚。
    三
    身如白璧貌如花，为报知心自毁家；
    但使胸中明月在，甘投缧绁到天涯。
    四
    年年怕看中秋月，每到中秋暗自伤；
    翘首长天问明月，白头何日好还乡。
