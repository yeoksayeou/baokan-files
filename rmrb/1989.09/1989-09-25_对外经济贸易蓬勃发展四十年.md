    Forty Years of Thriving Foreign Economic Trade
    Zheng Tuobin

    Major Achievements in Foreign Economic Trade

    Over the past four decades, China's foreign economic trade has undergone a process of growth from small to large, thriving development, and improvement. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the guidance of the reform and opening-up policy, it has taken on a new look, rapidly expanding and developing, achieving remarkable results:

    First, foreign trade volume has grown rapidly, and export earning capacity has been significantly enhanced. In 1950, China's foreign trade volume was only $1.35 billion, but by 1988 it had reached $80.4 billion, an increase of 70 times. Exports, which were only $5.52 billion in 1950, reached $40.639 billion in 1988, a 73-fold increase over 39 years; imports also increased from $5.83 billion in 1950 to $39.85 billion in 1988, more than a 68-fold increase. Export earning capacity and international payment capacity have been significantly enhanced. While imports and exports have grown, the structure of imported and exported goods has also improved significantly. Exports have gradually shifted from being mainly agricultural and mineral products to being mainly industrial manufactured goods.

    At the beginning of the founding of the nation, there were only a few dozen countries with trade relations with China. Now, this has expanded to more than 180 countries and regions. In 1978, China's exports ranked 32nd in the world, but by 1988, it had jumped to 16th, greatly enhancing China's credit standing.

    Second, significant progress has been made in utilizing foreign capital. Since 1979, China has begun to utilize funds from countries with different social systems. Over the past decade, China has actually used $33.04 billion in foreign loans for energy, transportation, communications, raw material industries, and infrastructure construction projects, playing an active role in adjusting the industrial structure and promoting the coordinated development of the national economy. By the end of 1988, a total of 15,948 foreign-invested enterprises of various types had been approved, including 8,539 joint ventures, 6,815 cooperative enterprises, and 594 wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Foreign investors had actually invested $12.058 billion, and 49 offshore oil exploration and development contracts had been signed. Among the foreign-invested projects, the number of production enterprises, export-oriented enterprises, and advanced technology enterprises has gradually increased; more than 7,000 foreign-invested enterprises that have signed contracts have gone into production, and the vast majority of them have good operating conditions, generally achieving a surplus in foreign exchange receipts and payments. The rapid increase in foreign direct investment has promoted the technological transformation of existing enterprises and has also played a certain role in stabilizing and increasing crude oil production.

    Third, the scale of technology introduction has expanded, and technology exports have begun to take off. China's technology introduction work began in the 1950s. Over the past 30-plus years, a large number of industrial technologies and complete sets of equipment have been introduced. Especially since 1979, the scale of technology introduction has rapidly expanded, with flexible and diverse methods, and the sources of introduced technology have become diversified. Over the past decade, a total of 3,530 technology introduction contracts have been approved by the state, with a total value of $20.55 billion, which has strongly promoted China's technological progress.

    In recent years, China has changed the situation of only introducing and not exporting technology, actively exporting China-developed technology through trade channels. By the end of 1988, a total of 306 items had been exported with a value of $500 million. Technology exports combined with commodity exports have continuously improved comprehensive benefits.

    Fourth, overseas contracting and labor cooperation have rapidly emerged, and overseas investment has shown initial results. China's overseas contracting and labor cooperation business was established in 1979. Over the past decade, Chinese companies have adhered to the business principle of "keeping promises, ensuring quality, making thin profits, and emphasizing righteousness," actively participating in international competition. By 1988, a total of 7,164 overseas contracting and labor cooperation contracts had been signed in 117 countries and regions, with a cumulative contract value of $10.3 billion and a completed business volume of $5.89 billion. A total of more than 300,000 laborers and various engineering and technical personnel had been sent abroad. Many companies have strengths in design, construction, consulting, and research, becoming a new force in the international contracting labor market. At the same time, China has established 526 non-trade enterprises abroad, with a total investment of $1.898 billion, of which China's investment accounts for 37.6%. Most of these enterprises have started operations and achieved good economic benefits.

    Fifth, economic and technological assistance to other countries has further developed. Soon after the founding of New China, China began to provide economic and technological assistance to other countries. By 1988, a total of 95 countries had received assistance from China; China had also helped 88 countries build 1,233 complete sets of projects, successively dispatching nearly 450,000 engineering and technical personnel, and training more than 50,000 foreign trainees. Since the reform and opening-up, China's foreign assistance in terms of layout, scale, structure, and methods has undergone reasonable adjustments and reforms. From 1979 to 1988, 24 new recipient countries were added, and a total of 330-plus complete sets of projects were helped to be built in 67 countries, contributing to the development of the national economies of the recipient countries.

    Sixth, active participation in international multilateral economic and technological cooperation. Since 1979, while China has made donations in the United Nations development system, it has also begun to accept assistance; at the same time, it has also accepted gratuitous technical assistance from developed countries. By 1988, a total of nearly $400 million in aid had been actually executed, arranging more than 600 technical cooperation projects in the fields of energy, transportation, machinery, electronics, chemicals, light industry, food, population, health, family planning, and child immunization, playing an active role in promoting China's economic, social development, and technological progress.

    A Promising Future for Continued Development

    From April to the first half of June this year, turmoil occurred in Beijing and other places, eventually developing into a riot. The Party Central Committee took decisive measures to suppress it, and most countries expressed understanding, with some explicitly expressing support. However, some Western developed countries, disregarding the facts, imposed economic sanctions on China, grossly interfering in China's internal affairs, temporarily causing some misunderstandings internationally and having different degrees of impact on various aspects of China's foreign economic and trade work. We cannot underestimate the impact and difficulties that the turmoil and riot have brought to China's foreign economic trade. However, our principle is to rely mainly on self-reliance and to strive for external aid as a supplement, and to rely mainly on our own strength for economic construction.

    Currently, China already has considerable economic strength and technological foundation, and has established trade relations with more than 180 countries and regions. The economic sanctions by a few countries cannot stop China's modernization construction. Moreover, with the development of technology to today's level, no country can monopolize all advanced technologies; in the context of surplus funds in the international market and increasingly fierce trade competition, no one wants to give up the market they have already occupied. Economic sanctions cannot stop China, but they will harm their own interests and provoke dissatisfaction among their own business circles towards the government. China's strategic position in the world is also something that Western countries cannot ignore. From this, it can be seen that all these influences are partial and temporary, and China's foreign economic trade will continue to develop.

    In the process of development, China's foreign economic trade will inevitably encounter various difficulties, but the prospect is good.

    First, the continued implementation of the reform and opening-up policy provides the basic conditions for the development of China's foreign economic trade. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee emphasized that adhering to the four cardinal principles is the foundation of our state, and reform and opening-up is the path to our national strength, which must be firmly and unremittingly implemented, and we will never return to the old path of closing the door to the outside world. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee after the adjustment of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is a team that reflects the image of reform and opening-up, and organizationally ensures the continued implementation of China's reform and opening-up policy. The deepening and expansion of reform and opening-up provide a broad space for the development of foreign economic trade.

    Second, the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has further consolidated the stable and united situation, providing a good domestic environment for the development of foreign economic trade, which is also a basic guarantee for the development of the trade.

    Third, the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production provides a material foundation for the development of foreign economic trade.

    At present, more than 180 countries and regions have trade relations with China, which gives China a great deal of room for maneuver in developing foreign economic trade.

    对外经济贸易蓬勃发展四十年
    郑拓彬
    对外经贸的重大成就
    四十年来，我国的对外经济贸易事业经历了从小到大、蓬勃发展和完善的过程，特别是党的十一届三中全会后，在改革开放方针的指引下，以新的姿态，迅速扩大、拓展，取得了显著成就：
    一、对外贸易额迅速增长，出口创汇能力显著增强。1950年，我国对外贸易额仅为11.35亿美元，1988年已达804亿美元，增长了70倍。出口额1950年仅5.52亿美元，1988年达406.39亿美元，39年增长73倍；进口也由1950年的5.83亿美元增加到1988年的398.5亿美元，增长68倍多。出口创汇能力和国际支付能力显著增强。在进出口增长的同时，进出口商品结构也有明显的改善。出口逐步由以出口农副、矿产品为主转向以出口工业制成品为主。
    建国初期同我国有贸易关系的仅几十个国家，现在扩大到180多个国家和地区。1978年我国出口在世界各国中居第32位，到1988年已跃居第16位，大大提高了我国的信用地位。
    二、利用外资取得显著进展。我国从1979年开始利用不同社会制度国家的资金。10年来，我国实际使用外国贷款330．4亿美元，用于能源、交通、通讯、原材料工业项目及基础设施建设，对调整产业结构，促进国民经济协调发展发挥了积极作用。至1988年底，共批准兴办各类外商直接投资企业15948个，其中：中外合资企业8539个，中外合作经营企业6815个，外商独资企业594个。外商实际投入资金120.58亿美元，合作勘探开发海上石油合同49项。外商投资项目中，生产性企业、产品出口企业和先进技术企业逐渐增多；7000多家已签合同的外商投资企业已投产，其中绝大部分经营情况良好，总体上达到了外汇收支平衡有余。外商直接投资的迅速增加，促进了原有企业的技术改造，对稳定和增加原油生产也起了一定作用。
    三、技术引进规模扩大，技术出口开始起步。我国技术引进工作始于50年代。30多年来，引进了大批工业技术和成套设备。特别是1979年以后，技术引进规模迅速扩大，方式灵活多样，引进技术的来源实现了多元化。10年来，经国家批准的技术引进合同共3530项，金额为205.5亿美元，有力地促进了我国的技术进步。
    近几年我国改变了只引进不出口技术的局面，积极通过贸易渠道出口我国开发的技术。至1988年底，共出口成交306项，金额为5亿美元。技术出口同商品出口相结合，综合效益不断提高。
    四、对外承包工程和劳务合作迅速崛起，海外投资初见成效。我国对外承包工程和劳务合作事业是1979年开始建立的。10年来，我国公司坚持“守约、保质、薄利、重义”的经营原则，积极参与国际竞争。至1988年，已在117个国家和地区共签订了对外承包工程和劳务合作合同7164项，累计合同金额达103亿美元，完成的营业额为58.9亿美元。派出劳务人员和各种工程技术人员总计30多万人次。不少公司在设计、施工、咨询、科研等方面均具实力，成为国际承包劳务市场上的一支新兴力量。同时，我公司还在国外兴办了526个非贸易企业，总投资额18.98亿美元，我方投资占37.6％。这些企业大部分已开业，取得较好的经济效益。
    五、对外经济技术援助进一步发展。新中国成立不久，我国就开始对外提供经济技术援助。到1988年，接受过我国援助的国家共95个；我国还帮助88个国家建成了1233个成套项目，先后派出工程技术人员近45万人次，培训外国实习生5万多人。改革开放以来，我国对外援助的布局、规模、结构和方式都进行了合理的调整和改革。1979年至1988年，新增加受援国24个，共帮助67个国家建成了330多个成套项目，为受援国发展民族经济做出了贡献。
    六、积极开展国际多边经济技术合作。从1979年起，我国在联合国发展系统认捐的同时，也开始接受其援助；同时，还接受发达国家政府提供的无偿技术援助。到1988年，接受援款实际执行额近4亿美元，安排了600多个技术合作项目，分布于能源、交通、机械、电子、化工、轻工、食品、人口、保健、计划生育和儿童免疫等领域，对促进我国的经济、社会发展和科技进步发挥了积极作用。
    继续发展的良好前景
    今年4月到6月上旬北京等地发生了动乱，并最终发展为暴乱，党中央采取了果断的措施予以平息，多数国家对此都表示理解，有的明确表示支持。但一些西方发达国家不顾事实真相，对我进行经济制裁，粗暴干涉我国内政，一时在国际上也产生一些误解，对我国对外经贸工作的各方面产生了不同程度的影响。对于动乱和暴乱给我国对外经济贸易带来的影响和困难，我们不能低估。但是我们的原则是自力更生为主、争取外援为辅，搞经济建设主要依靠自己的力量。
    现在我国已具有相当的经济实力和技术基础，已同世界上180多个国家和地区建立了经贸关系，少数国家采取经济制裁的办法是阻挡不住中国现代化建设的步伐的。而且技术发展到今天的水平，哪个国家也不可能垄断一切先进技术；在国际市场资金过剩、贸易竞争日趋激烈的情况下，谁也不愿意放弃已占领的市场。经济制裁制不住中国，却会损害它们本国的利益，激起本国企业界对政府的不满。我国在世界上所处的战略地位也是西方国家不可忽视的。由此可见，所有这些影响都是局部的、暂时的，我国的对外经济贸易事业必将继续向前发展。
      我国的对外经济贸易事业在发展中不可避免地会遇到这样那样的困难，但前景是好的。
    首先，继续实行改革开放政策为我国对外经济贸易的发展提供了基本条件。中共十三届四中全会强调指出，坚持四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，改革开放是我们的强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，决不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。十三届四中全会调整后的中央政治局常委，是一个体现改革开放面貌的班子，从组织上保证了我国改革开放政策继续贯彻执行。改革开放的不断深化和扩大，为对外经济贸易的发展提供了广阔天地。
    其次，平息北京反革命暴乱进一步巩固了安定团结的局面，为对外经济贸易的发展提供了一个良好的国内环境，这也是发展经贸事业的基本保证。
    第三，工农业生产持续发展，为对外经济贸易的发展提供了物质基础。
    目前，已有180多个国家和地区同我国有经济贸易关系，这就使得我国在发展对外经济贸易上有很大的回旋余地。
