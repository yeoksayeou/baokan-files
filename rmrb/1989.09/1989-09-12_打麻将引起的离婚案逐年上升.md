The number of divorce cases caused by playing mahjong is gradually increasing. According to statistics from some regions, in 1987, 4% of divorce cases were due to gambling, which rose to 20% in 1988. In the first quarter of this year, it further increased to 25%. There are several situations where gambling leads to divorce:

	Both husband and wife become addicted to mahjong, leading to conflicts. A couple who had been married for over 10 years became addicted to playing mahjong. After work, they would not cook, do housework, or take care of the children. Instead, they would set up the "battlefield" and play until late at night, sometimes even all night. As a result, the couple lost a lot of money and blamed each other for not doing housework.

	Unable to resist temptation, leading to lifelong regret. A man was addicted to playing mahjong every day. Whenever he lost money, he would feel guilty towards his wife and children and vow to quit. However, he could not resist the temptation of "three missing one." After repeating this cycle several times, his wife no longer believed his promises. By the time he realized his mistake, it was too late!

	Losing all the money, selling off family property, and not caring about the wife and children. A self-employed individual used to live a good life. After learning to play mahjong, his business declined, his savings were depleted, and he sold off his property. This led to constant arguments and fights between the couple. When the child fell ill, there was no money for treatment, and the wife left him with the child.

	Mahjong is a "third party" that ruins family happiness and has become a significant social problem. It not only brings misfortune to families but also causes great harm to society. This issue should be given attention by society, and those who are addicted to playing mahjong should wake up!

　　打麻将引起的离婚案逐年上升
    打麻将而引起的离婚案件逐渐增多。据一些地区的统计，1987年因赌博引起离婚的占离婚案件总数的4％，1988年上升为20％，今年第一季度又上升到25％。赌博引起离婚有以下几种情况：
    夫妻双双上牌桌，终至反目。一对结婚10多年的夫妻，打麻将上了瘾。下班回家，不做饭，不干家务，不管孩子，便摆开“战场”，一打就是半夜，甚至通宵。结果，这对夫妇输了许多钱，还为干家务互相指责。
    经不住诱惑，悔恨终生。有一男人整天沉湎于牌桌，每每输了钱就觉得对不起老婆孩子，便发誓痛改前非。可是，他又经不住“三缺一”的诱惑。如此反复数次之后，妻子不再信他的誓言了。等到人去屋空，他才如梦方醒，悔之晚矣！
    钱输光了就变卖家产，不顾妻儿的死活。一个体经营者原先小日子过得很红火。自学会了打麻将，他的生意荒了，存款光了，家产卖了。为此，夫妻间天天吵闹打架，孩子病了也无钱医治，妻子带着孩子离开了他。
    麻将是破坏家庭幸福的“第三者”，已成为一大社会公害。它不仅给家庭带来不幸，也给社会造成巨大的危害。这个问题，希望能引起社会的注意，也希望那些沉湎于打麻将的人们猛醒！河北张家口市桥西区民政局　思　成
