On July 24, the Beijing Railway Bureau’s Short-Term Car Team received a warm and enthusiastic letter of thanks from a certain unit of the People’s Liberation Army stationed at Beijing Railway Station. The letter stated: “We sincerely thank the excellent workers trained and educated by your team’s leadership. During the martial law period, they shared with us over 60 days and nights of hardship, providing us with meticulous care and assistance in our daily lives, helping us solve many practical problems. Especially during the turmoil, they stood side by side with us, contributing to the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.”

On May 20, the State Council announced martial law in certain areas of Beijing. Martial law troops began arriving in Beijing to carry out their duties. The reactionary elements who meticulously organized, plotted, and instigated this wave of unrest, with their hidden agendas, spread rumors such as “the troops entering the city will suppress students and the people,” inciting some students and the public who were unaware of the truth to set up barricades, block military vehicles, and verbally and physically assault the martial law troops. The east and west sections of Chang’an Street were filled with continuous parades, and many of Beijing’s transportation routes were disrupted, making it difficult for workers to commute.

Faced with these situations, some workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau’s Short-Term Car Team, especially the crew members who travel back and forth, were to varying degrees influenced by external factors. Some believed that the students’ hunger strike was for the future of the country and the prosperity of the nation, and seeing many people taking to the streets, they also wanted to join in to support the students…

Faced with the workers’ various thoughts and discussions, the party branch secretary, Cao Guoqian, and the team leader, Zhang Minghua, took the lead in seriously studying and discussing, unifying their understanding. They believed: At this critical moment, how to play the role of a grassroots party organization as a stronghold, do good ideological and political work for the workers, guide the workers to distinguish right from wrong, and maintain unity with the Party Central Committee is our sacred duty; if we do not pay attention to this, let the workers believe in rumors, and go to the streets to parade, the trains will not be able to run, the consequences will be unimaginable, and that would be our serious dereliction of duty. Therefore, they promptly convened a workers’ meeting, organized the workers to seriously study and repeatedly discuss the important speeches of Premier Li Peng and Chairman Yang Shangkun, as well as the April 26 editorial of the People’s Daily. They sincerely told the workers: “We, the working class, are the masters of the country. At this critical moment that concerns the fate of the Party and the country, we must not believe in rumors and spread them, but must firmly guard our posts, be loyal to our duties, and ensure the normal operation of the railways. This is the concrete manifestation of our railway workers’ patriotism.”

Regarding some workers’ opinions on prices, they said: “The achievements of the past ten years of reform and opening up are tangible and visible to everyone. Although prices have risen somewhat, our overall income has still increased. Whether it is food, clothing, or housing, everything is much better than before. A few people with ulterior motives, taking advantage of the people’s dissatisfaction with the current individual leaders’ corruption, embezzlement, and bribery, have incited unrest, directing the blame at the government. We, the working class, must not be deceived!”

Regarding some workers’ lack of understanding of martial law, they explained the glorious deeds of the People’s Liberation Army: “The PLA is our most beloved people. Whenever the Party and the people need them, they are always at the forefront. The Tangshan earthquake, the Great Khingan fire, the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, all these times, the People’s Liberation Army has used their lives and blood to protect the safety of the country and the people’s lives and property… All of this fully proves that the PLA is the people’s army, the iron wall of the state.”

During the turmoil, the party branch of this team also sent ideological and political work to the trains and the workers’ homes, raising the workers’ awareness and stabilizing their emotions.

On May 21, a train carrying martial law troops was stopped on the south side of Platform 6 at Beijing Station. Some students and the public who were unaware of the truth surrounded the soldiers to give speeches, some mocking and insulting, some spitting at the soldiers, throwing debris, and hitting their helmets, pulling their clothes, and some even waving flags and shouting reactionary slogans at them.

When the team’s leaders and crew members saw the soldiers enduring humiliation, living in the hot summer in the unmodified train cars, they felt very sad and heartbroken.

The team leaders once again told the crew members: “The martial law troops, not retaliating when struck, not responding when insulted, enduring hunger and hardship, silently enduring all this in such harsh conditions, why? Isn’t it for social stability, for the people of the capital to have normal lives and work order, for the countless revolutionary martyrs’ achievements to never change color…”

These words moved the crew members to tears, and they expressed, “We are willing to endure all hardships ourselves, but we will not let the soldiers face any difficulties.” Thus, they thought of what the soldiers needed and urgently provided for them. They bought soap, towels, stationery, and other daily necessities for the soldiers; they sent them cups, ice, and water in a timely manner; seeing the soldiers living on the tracks and the floor without bedding, they sent them 100 white bedsheets and bedding, and changed them as they got dirty…

This team, by paying attention to the ideological education of the workers, ensured that during the entire wave of unrest, not a single person left their post to participate in any support or parade activities, earning praise from the higher authorities and the martial law troops.

    风雨见真情
    尹思伯
    7月24日，北京列车段短预车队收到解放军某部驻北京站戒严部队写来的一封热情洋溢的感谢信。信中写道：“衷心感谢贵队领导教育培养出来的好工人，在戒严期间，他们和我们共同度过了艰难的60多个日日夜夜，生活上给了我们无微不至的关怀和照顾，帮助我们解决了不少实际困难，特别是在暴乱期间，同我们并肩战斗，为粉碎反革命暴乱作出了贡献。”
    5月20日，国务院宣布北京部分地区实行戒严后，戒严部队官兵陆续进京执行任务。那些精心组织、阴谋策划这次学潮、动乱、暴乱的反革命分子，怀着不可告人的目的，散布什么“部队进城要镇压学生和人民”等谣言，煽动一些不明真相的学生和群众，设路障、围堵军车、辱骂殴打戒严部队官兵，东西长安街上的游行队伍来往不断，北京的不少线路的交通被中断，工人上下班十分困难。
    面对这些情况，北京列车段短预车队的一些职工、特别是南来北往跑车的乘务员，不同程度地受到一些外界的影响。他们中有的认为大学生绝食是为了国家的前途、民族的兴旺，看到不少人上街游行，也想上街去声援学生……
    面对职工的种种想法和议论，车队的党总支书记曹国权、队长张明花带头认真学习、讨论，统一认识。他们认为：在这关键时刻，如何发挥基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用、做好职工的思想政治工作、引导职工辨明真假是非、与党中央保持一致，这是我们的神圣职责；如果不理不问，让职工听信谣言，上街游行，列车开不出去，后果不堪设想，那将是我们的严重失职。因此，他们及时召开职工大会，组织职工认真学习，反复讨论李鹏总理和杨尚昆主席的重要讲话以及《人民日报》4月26日社论。他们诚恳地对职工说：“我们工人阶级是国家的主人，在这关系党和国家存亡的关键时刻，绝不能听信谣言和传谣，一定要坚守岗位，忠于职守，保证铁路的正常运输，这才是我们铁路工人爱国的具体表现。”
    针对一些职工对物价的意见，他们说：“这十多年改革开放的成果是大家都摸得着、看得见的。虽然物价高了一些，但我们总的收入还是增加了，不论是吃的、穿的，还是住的，都比过去好得多。极少数别有用心的人，利用人民群众对当前个别领导干部以权谋私、贪污受贿等腐败现象的不满心理，大肆煽动，把矛头指向政府，我们工人阶级可不能上当呀！”
    针对一些职工对戒严不大理解，他们大讲解放军的丰功伟绩：“解放军是我们最可亲的人，每当党和人民最需要的时候，他们总是冲锋在前。唐山地震，大兴安岭发生火灾，对越自卫还击战，都是人民解放军用自己的生命和鲜血保卫着国家和人民的生命财产安全……这一切都充分证明，解放军是人民的子弟兵，是国家的钢铁长城。”
    在动乱期间，这个车队的党总支还把思想政治工作送到列车上和职工家中，使职工提高了认识，稳定了情绪。
    5月21日，北京站第6站台南侧停着一列戒严部队官兵的列车，一些不明真相的学生和群众围堵官兵进行讲演，有的讽刺谩骂，有的向官兵吐唾沫、扔杂物、敲打他们头上的钢盔，拽他们的衣服，一些人还打着旗帜冲着他们呼喊反动口号。
    当这个车队的领导和乘务员看到官兵们忍辱负重，在这炎热的夏天，住在那待修的车厢里，非常难过和痛心。
    车队领导又一次向乘务员讲：“戒严部队官兵，打不还手，骂不还口，忍饥挨饿，在这样艰苦的条件下，默默地忍受着，他们是为了什么？还不是为了社会的安定，为了首都人民有正常的生活和工作秩序，为的是千千万万革命先烈打下的江山永不变色……。”
    一席话说得乘务员掉下了热泪，表示“宁愿自己千辛万苦，也不让官兵一事为难”。于是他们想官兵之所想，急官兵之所急，为官兵代购肥皂、香皂、毛巾、信纸、信封等生活用品；给他们送去茶杯、冰块，及时为他们供水；看到官兵住在没有卧具的铁轨上、地板上，就给他们送去100条雪白的床单和卧具，并随脏随换……
    这个车队由于重视对职工的思想教育，在整个学潮、动乱、暴乱期间，没有一个人离开工作岗位去搞什么声援、游行等活动的，得到上级领导机关和戒严部队的好评。
