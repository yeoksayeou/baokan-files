    China's young aerospace industry has risen to the world's leading ranks.

    China has successfully launched 25 man-made satellites and has successfully developed and launched the Fengbao-1 and Long March 1 through 4 rockets.

    China has produced short-range, medium-range, long-range, and intercontinental missiles, including both land-to-land missiles and underwater-launched submarine-to-land missiles. An initial strategic missile system with matching ranges and multiple launch methods has been formed, giving China a nuclear deterrent capability. In the field of tactical missiles, a full-spectrum air defense and coastal defense missile system has been established, and there have been breakthroughs in land-to-land tactical missiles.

    In terms of aerospace technology, China has become the third country in the world to master satellite recovery technology and low-temperature fuel rocket technology, maintaining an 11-time satellite recovery record without failure. Satellite tracking and control technology and geostationary satellite launch technology are also at the world's leading level.

    航天工业迅速腾飞跃居世界先进行列
    据新华社北京电　（记者李安定）我国年轻的航天工业已跻身世界先进行列。
    我国已成功发射人造卫星25颗，还成功地研制和发射了风暴一号及长征一号至四号5种运载火箭。
    我国已生产近程、中程、远程、洲际导弹，既有地对地导弹，也有水下发射的潜地导弹。初步形成射程配套、有多种发射方式的战略导弹体系，使我国具有核反击的威慑力量；在战术导弹方面，已形成全空域的防空和海防导弹体系，地对地战术导弹也有突破。
    在航天技术方面，我国已成为世界上第三个掌握卫星回收技术和低温燃料火箭技术的国家，并保持了11次卫星回收无一失败的纪录。卫星测控技术、地球同步卫星发射技术也处于世界领先水平。
