The moon tonight is at its fullest.

A faint silver glow, like a thin veil of mist, envelops the heavens and the earth.

A radiant orb, pure and clear as jade, brings a sense of tranquility to the vast expanse of the sky, inspiring deep longing.

Once upon a time, it was a world of fairy tales, with Chang'e, Wu Gang, the Jade Rabbit, and the Golden Osmanthus inspiring endless imagination. Now, it is filled with human emotions. Gazing at it, some are lost in the ecstasy of love, some are wishing for a happy future, and some are praying for the swift departure of the shadows that obscure the sky.

A stick of incense burns silently, and wisps of smoke fill the dreamlike world. What a night full of longing!

Though we may be separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, we all share the same round halo of light above our heads.

Despite the many emotional barriers among people, everyone harbors a round dream in their hearts.

Roundness brings harmony to married couples and vitality to the nation.

I cannot help but think of the families of border guards who willingly live apart to ensure the unity of others, and of the two sides of the strait that should be together but are sadly separated. The world should be harmonious, yet it is filled with strife.

“People have their joys and sorrows, separations and reunions; the moon has its waxing and waning, its fullness and darkness.” A full moon is rare. Precisely because of this, people tirelessly pursue it; with shared aspirations, they savor the annual Mid-Autumn Festival.

　　中秋月
　　西中扬
    今夜的月最圆。
    淡淡的银光，如轻纱薄雾，笼罩于天地之间。
    一轮光华，玉洁冰清，给深邃的天宇带来一片静谧，令人神往。
    那里曾经是童话的世界，嫦娥，吴刚、玉兔、金桂给人间带来无限遐想。如今，却充满了人间的情愫。望着她，有人沉浸在恋情的陶醉中，有人在祝愿幸福的未来，有人在祈求遮天蔽日的阴影迅速离去。
    一柱心香悄悄燃起，缕缕轻烟弥漫着梦幻般的世界。好一个充满思念的夜！
    我们尽管相隔千山万水，头上都顶着一个圆圆的光环。
    人类尽管有许多感情障碍，心中无不蕴含着一个圆圆的构想。
    圆，使夫妻酣声香甜，国家热气蒸腾。
    我不由得想起为他人团圆而甘愿异地相处的边防军人家庭，想起本该团圆却怅然分隔的海峡两岸。世界原应和谐却充满纷争。
      “人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺。”满月难得。唯其如此，人们才孜孜不倦地追求；怀着共同心愿，品味一年一度的中秋。
