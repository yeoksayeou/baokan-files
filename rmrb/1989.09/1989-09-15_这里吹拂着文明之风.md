Along with the reform and opening up, the wind of spiritual civilization has been blowing across the land of Min (Fujian Province). Activities such as "Warmth in Fuzhou," "Friendliness in Zhangzhou," "Affection in Longyan," and the "Hundred Excellent Service Competition" held in Xiamen City reflect the specific content of civilized construction in various places and cities in Fujian Province, embodying the spiritual outlook of the people.

Famous nationwide as a civilized city, Sanming has been carrying out the "Satisfaction in Sanming" activity since 1987, making people feel comfortable, safe, and affectionate when they come here. Strolling through the city, the streets and alleys always seem freshly swept. Trees, lawns, and flowers are everywhere along the roadsides, in government offices, courtyards, and riversides, delighting the eye. During the turmoil, Sanming remained stable and calm. All colleges and universities in the city did not miss a single class, and all factories and enterprises did not stop work for a single day. No one participated in parades, demonstrations, sit-ins, or hunger strikes. No matter where you go, in train stations, hotels, shops, or government offices, you always feel that there are more smiles and more human kindness. Something particularly touching happened here. A young man from Wanzhou, Sichuan, Li Wenguo, accidentally fell into a charcoal pit while working in the countryside of Sanming and suffered severe burns over a large area, his life hanging by a thread. To save him from the clutches of death, the medical staff of Sanming Chemical Factory Hospital worked day and night in the operating room. Many citizens rushed to donate blood, and cadres, workers, residents, and young pioneers donated 35,000 yuan. Li Wenguo was saved. He said emotionally, "It is the people of Sanming who gave me a second life."

Fujian's spiritual civilization construction has been progressing step by step, promoting the development of economic construction.

　　这里吹拂着文明之风
    伴随着改革开放，精神文明之风在八闽大地吹拂。“温暖在榕城（福州）”、“友爱在漳州”、“亲切在龙岩”活动，以及厦门市开展的“百家窗口优质服务竞赛活动”，从各个侧面反映了福建省各地、市抓文明建设的具体内容，体现了人们的精神面貌。
    闻名全国的文明之城三明市，从1987年开始一直在进行着“满意在三明”的活动，使人来到这里有着舒适感、安全感和亲切感。漫步市区，大街小巷总像是刚刚清扫过一样。马路旁、机关内、庭院里、沿河旁，到处是树木、草坪和鲜花，令人赏心悦目。动乱期间，三明稳定而平静，全市所有大中专院校，没停一节课，所有工厂、企业没停一天工、一天业，也没人参加游行、示威，搞静坐、绝食那一套。不管你走到哪里，在车站、在宾馆、在商店、在机关，总感到这里的笑脸多，人间真情多。这里发生过一件十分动人的事，四川万县青年李文国，在三明市农村烧炭时不慎掉进炭窑，大面积深度烧伤，生命垂危。为了把他从死神手中抢救过来，三明化工厂职工医院医护人员日夜奋战在手术台，许多市民争先献血，干部、工人、居民和少年儿童捐款3.5万元。李文国得救了。他感动地说，是三明人给了我第二次生命。
    福建精神文明建设一步一个台阶，推动了经济建设的发展。				（众和）
