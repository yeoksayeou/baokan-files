With the state's strong support and the people's arduous struggle, the old revolutionary base area of Shaanbei has undergone significant changes.

    The People's Daily, Yanan, September 11 - Reporter Meng Xi'an learned from the Shaanbei Old Revolutionary Base Area Economic Development Symposium currently held here that the reform and opening up have injected new vitality into the long-impoverished Shaanbei region. Over the past decade, under the care and support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, more than 5 million cadres and masses in the region have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle of Yanan, bringing about historic changes in the old revolutionary base area of Shaanbei.

    The old revolutionary base area of Shaanbei includes 33 counties and cities in the Yanan and Yulin regions and parts of the northern Guanzhong region. In 1978, the per capita grain output in rural areas was only 100 kilograms, and the annual per capita net income was only 47 yuan. To help the people of the old revolutionary base area of Shaanbei shake off poverty as soon as possible, the Party Central Committee and the State Council allocated 50 million yuan in construction funds in 1979 and 40 million yuan in poverty alleviation interest-free loans in 1987 to help Shaanbei develop its economy. Shaanxi Province also established the Shaanbei Construction Committee, with the provincial party secretary serving as the committee's director. Dozens of department-level leaders participated in investigations, decision-making, and command. 107 experts and professors visited more than 500 townships in all 33 counties in the region, conducted repeated verifications, and determined 8 key development projects for Shaanbei. Through the arduous efforts of cadres and masses throughout the region, the old revolutionary base area of Shaanbei has undergone tremendous changes:

    - The basic conditions for agriculture have significantly improved, and agricultural production has seen considerable development. Compared to 1988 and 1978, the per capita basic farmland increased from 1.5 mu to 2.5 mu, the afforested area increased by 77%, the area of artificial grass planting increased by 5 times, the agricultural power lines increased by 1.5 times, the mountain roads increased by 42%, the grain output reached 1.4 billion kilograms, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1978, the planting area or output of flue-cured tobacco, fruit trees, and fresh potatoes increased by 2 to 3 times, and the total agricultural output value reached 1.39 billion yuan, an increase of more than 100%.

    - The industry has developed four major products: coal, petroleum, wool spinning, and cigarettes. Compared to 1988 and 1978, the total industrial output value increased by 2.8 times, the output value of township enterprises increased by 12.8 times, and fiscal revenue increased by nearly 4 times.

    - The poverty alleviation effect is significant, with a per capita net income of 265 yuan, an increase of more than 4 times compared to 1978. 1.8 million people have solved the problem of food and clothing, and 880,000 people have already shaken off poverty and are on the road to prosperity.

    本报延安9月11日电　记者孟西安从正在这里召开的陕北老区经济开发座谈会上获悉：改革开放给长期处于贫困状况的陕北大地注入勃勃生机。10年来，在党中央、国务院的关怀支援下，全区500多万干部群众发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的延安精神，使陕北老区面貌发生了历史性变化。
    陕北老区包括延安、榆林两个地区和关中北部部分地区的33个县市。1978年全区农村人均粮食仅100公斤，年均纯收入仅47元。为了帮助陕北老区人民早日脱贫，党中央、国务院于1979年和1987年，分别拨出5000万元建设资金和4000万元扶贫贴息贷款，帮助陕北开发经济。陕西还专门成立了陕北建设委员会，历届省委书记兼任该委主任，数十名厅局级领导参与调查研究、决策和指挥。107名专家、教授跑遍了全区33个县的500多个乡镇，经过反复论证，确定了陕北8个重点开发项目。经过全区干部群众的艰苦奋斗，陕北老区发生了巨大的变化：
    ——农业基本条件明显改善，农业生产有了较大发展。1988年和1978年相比，农村人均基本农田由1.5亩增加到2.5亩，造林面积增长77％，人工种草面积增长5倍，农电线路增长1.5倍，山区公路增长42％，粮食达14亿公斤，比1978年增长4成多，烤烟、果树、鲜薯种植面积或产量分别增长2至3倍，农业总产值达13.9亿元，增长1倍多。

    ——扶贫效果显著，人均纯收入265元，比1978年增长4倍多，已有180万人解决了温饱问题，88万人已经脱贫，正在走向富裕之路。
