The People's Republic of China has been established for 40 years. It has ended the fragmented situation of old China, achieving unprecedented unity and solidarity of the Chinese nation, and stands tall and independent in the East. Now, the issues of Hong Kong and Macau have been resolved one after another, and the issue of unification between Taiwan and the mainland has become even more urgent for all the people of China.

For the past 40 years, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have been tirelessly working to maintain the integrity of the national territory and promote the unification of Taiwan and the mainland. Even when cross-strait relations were in a state of military standoff, efforts were made to seek a peaceful resolution. As early as May 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed that the Chinese people were willing to seek a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue under possible conditions. In April 1956, Chairman Mao Zedong proposed policies such as "peace first," "love the country, love the people," and "patriotism comes first," and made various efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to cross-strait relations. In December 1978, the Communist Party of China held the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in accordance with the spirit of the plenary session's resolution, issued the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" from the perspective of safeguarding the highest interests of the entire Chinese nation, clearly proposing the policy of "peaceful reunification of the motherland." Subsequently, central leaders such as Ye Jianying and Deng Xiaoping made a series of important speeches, further elaborating on this policy and proposing the scientific concept of "one country, two systems." This has paved the way for the easing of cross-strait relations and the ultimate realization of national unification.

We are pleased to see that Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo and some far-sighted individuals in Taiwan, under internal and external pressures and changes in the domestic and international situation, have taken some measures to improve cross-strait relations. With joint efforts from both sides, starting from the second half of 1987, the frozen relations between the two sides for 40 years began to thaw, and various exchanges gradually developed. Since November 1987 alone, over 800,000 Taiwanese have come to the mainland for visits, tourism, and business, and more than 2,000 mainland compatriots have gone to Taiwan for visiting the sick and attending funerals; in the two and a half years since 1987, the total indirect trade volume between the two sides has reached 6 billion US dollars; the total investment agreements reached by Taiwanese businessmen in the mainland have exceeded 600 million US dollars. Other aspects such as culture, sports, academia, and science and technology have also made remarkable progress in direct or indirect exchanges. During the severe struggle against the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing in the spring and summer of this year, although there were some people in Taiwan who spread rumors and stirred up trouble, the vast majority of Taiwanese compatriots did not wish for turmoil on the mainland, just as the mainland wishes for a stable and prosperous Taiwan. They realize that only a stable and prosperous mainland is in the interest of the Taiwanese people. They hope to maintain and develop cross-strait relations. After experiencing this turmoil and as the facts become clearer, visits, tourism, trade, and other activities are gradually returning to their original development momentum.

However, we must point out that in recent periods, the Taiwan authorities have deviated from the interests of the entire Chinese nation on some major principle issues and taken a series of actions that are not conducive to national unification. On the one hand, they continue to stubbornly insist on the "three nos" policy, strengthen enemy consciousness, and claim to use the so-called "Taiwan experience" to launch a "political counterattack" on the mainland, especially using the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing to incite and deceive, strengthen political infiltration, and worsen cross-strait relations; on the other hand, they are trying every means to play the so-called "dual recognition" trick, seeking the status of an "independent political entity" for Taiwan in the international arena, and attempting to create a situation of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan." Such actions will inevitably escalate tensions in the strait, harm the interests of all the people of China, including the people of Taiwan, directly hinder the development of Taiwan, and may even provide an opportunity for imperialist forces that covet Taiwan. This is a step backward and something we firmly oppose.

Currently, the situation in the strait is at an important stage of development. We believe that to continue promoting and developing cross-strait relations, it is urgent for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all patriotic democratic parties and patriotic individuals, to work together. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will genuinely adhere to the "one China" principle, stop all actions that may lead to the division of China, especially not to engage in so-called "dual recognition" under the name of "pragmatic diplomacy"; continue to create a relaxed atmosphere across the strait, stop all hostile propaganda and activities aimed at overthrowing the socialist system and regime; based on the principle of mutual benefit, actively develop the "three links" across the strait, promote trade and cultural and academic exchanges; establish channels for cross-strait dialogue and liaison, and discuss and regulate relevant institutions and matters for both sides' exchanges. In this way, it is possible to create a good atmosphere and conditions for further deepening understanding, increasing exchanges, and for dialogue and peaceful negotiations on the issue of cross-strait unification.

Today, the world situation has seen important changes from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. Faced with this trend, the Chinese nation is facing a severe challenge and competition. The situation is pressing, and we must not delay. We should unite under the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences and mutual understanding and accommodation to achieve early cooperation across the strait and jointly revitalize China. Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we are fully confident in completing this glorious and arduous historical task. We reiterate here: The Communist Party of China's policy of "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" proposed in respect of history and reality will not change; our open policy to promote the "three links" and expand exchanges will not change, and we will make new efforts to better promote the overall development of cross-strait relations; we place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and are willing to engage in equal negotiations with the ruling Kuomintang on the unification of the motherland; we place even greater hopes on the people of Taiwan and are willing to discuss state affairs with various parties, groups, and individuals in Taiwan and exchange views on the issue of unification. We are convinced that as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all patriotic democratic parties and people of all strata across the strait, are sincere and cooperative, follow the trend, and further promote the overall development of cross-strait relations, then the early realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland and the revitalization of the nation is full of hope.

    为早日实现祖国的和平统一而继续努力
    本报评论员
    中华人民共和国自成立迄今已经四十周年，她结束了旧中国的四分五裂局面，实现了中华民族空前的统一和团结，以强大而独立自主的姿态屹立于世界的东方。如今，香港、澳门问题已相继得到解决，台湾与祖国大陆的统一问题更加迫切地摆在全中国人民的面前。
    四十年来，中国共产党和中国政府一直为维护国家领土的完整和促进台湾与大陆的统一，进行着不懈的努力，即使在两岸关系尚处于军事对峙状态下，也是积极争取和平解决。早在1955年5月，周恩来总理就曾提出，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解决台湾问题。1956年4月，毛泽东主席又提出了“和为贵”、“爱国一家”和“爱国不分先后”等政策，并就争取两岸关系的和平解决作过种种努力。1978年12月，中国共产党召开了十一届三中全会，全国人大常委会依据全会决议精神，从维护整个中华民族的最高利益出发，发表《告台湾同胞书》，明确提出了“和平统一祖国”的大政方针；随后，叶剑英、邓小平等中央领导同志发表了一系列重要讲话，又对此方针作了充分的阐述，提出了“一国两制”的科学构想。这就为两岸关系走向缓和和最终实现国家统一开辟了道路。
    我们高兴地看到，蒋经国先生及台湾一些有识之士迫于内外压力和国内外形势的变化，在改善两岸关系方面采取了一些措施。在双方共同努力下，自1987年下半年开始，两岸隔绝了40年的关系开始解冻，各种交流逐渐开展。仅1987年11月以来，来大陆探亲、旅游和经商的台胞已达80余万人次，去台湾探病奔丧的大陆同胞也有2000余人；1987年以来的两年半时间内，两岸间接贸易总额达60亿美元；台商来大陆达成的协议投资总额已逾6亿美元。其他如文化、体育、学术、科技等方面的直接或间接交流也都取得了令人瞩目的进展。今年春夏之交在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的严峻斗争中，台湾岛内尽管也有那么一些人大肆造谣、推波助澜、惟恐不乱，但广大台湾同胞并不期望大陆出现动乱，就像大陆期望有一个稳定而繁荣的台湾一样，他们认识到只有一个稳定而繁荣的大陆，才是台湾人民的利益所在，他们希望保持和发展两岸关系。在经历了这场风波，以及事实真相越来越清楚之后，探亲、旅游、经贸等正在逐渐恢复原有的发展势头。
    但我们不能不指出，近一个时期以来，台湾当局在一些重大原则问题上背离整个中华民族的利益，采取了一系列不利于祖国统一的行动。他们一方面继续顽固坚持“三不政策”、“强化敌我意识”，声称以所谓“台湾经验”对大陆进行“政治反攻”，特别是利用北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱进行煽动蛊惑，加强政治渗透，恶化两岸气氛；另一方面又千方百计玩弄所谓“双重承认”的把戏，谋求台湾在国际上所谓“独立政治实体”的地位，妄图造成“两个中国”或“一中一台”并立的事实。这样做的结果，将必然加剧海峡的紧张局势，损害包括台湾人民在内的全中国人民的利益，直接妨碍台湾的发展，甚至会给觊觎台湾的帝国主义势力以可乘之机。这是一种倒退，是我们所坚决反对的。
    当前，海峡局势正处于一个重要的发展阶段。我们认为，要继续推动和发展两岸的关系，亟需国共两党以及一切爱国民主政党和爱国人士共同努力。我们希望台湾当局切实遵行“一个中国”的原则，停止一切可能导致中国分裂的行动，尤其不再在“务实外交”名义下搞所谓“双重承认”；继续创造两岸缓和气氛，停止各种敌对性宣传和一切旨在以颠覆社会主义政权和制度为目的的活动；根据互利互惠原则，积极发展两岸间的“三通”，推动经贸往来和文化学术等各项交流；建立两岸对话联络渠道，研商和规范双方交往的有关制度和事项。这样，就有可能为进一步加深了解、增进往来，为沟通对话乃至和平商谈两岸统一问题创造良好的气氛和条件。
    当今世界形势已出现从对抗走向对话，由紧张转向缓和的重要变化。在这个大趋势面前，中华民族正面临着严峻的挑战和竞争，形势逼人，时不我待，应该在求同存异、互谅互让的原则下团结起来，早日实现两岸合作，共同振兴中华。回顾过去，展望未来，我们完全有信心完成这一光荣而艰巨的历史任务。我们愿在此重申：中国共产党尊重历史、尊重现实所提出的“和平统一、一国两制”的对台方针，是不会改变的；我们为促进“三通”、扩大交流而采取的开放政策也是不会改变的，我们还将为更好地推动两岸关系的全面发展而作出新的努力；我们寄希望于台湾当局，愿同执政的国民党就祖国的统一，进行平等谈判；我们更寄希望于台湾广大人民，愿同台湾各党派团体、各界人士共商国是，就统一问题交换意见。我们坚信，只要国共两党以及两岸一切爱国民主政党和各阶层爱国人士推诚相见，精诚合作，顺应潮流，进一步推动两岸关系的全面发展，那么，早日实现祖国的和平统一和国家民族的振兴是大有希望的。
