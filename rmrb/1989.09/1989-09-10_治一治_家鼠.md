Recently, the Baixia District Court in Nanjing has legally punished seven individuals who stole public property. It is understood that similar cases are on the rise. There is a bad phenomenon in society that can be called "house mice." The phenomenon of petty theft within enterprises and units, which has not yet constituted a crime, has been spreading in recent years. People are very concerned about this "house mice" infestation.

There is no doubt that corruption must be addressed. It is necessary to rectify large companies, but the erosion and harm caused by "house mice" stealing within the organization to the state, the collective, and the people cannot be ignored. The "Hard Rat" in the "Book of Songs" satirizes exploiters. But now, if a unit's cafeteria has a "big rat," the food there is bound to be poor, with low-quality meals and high prices being inevitable. If a construction site has a "big house mouse," the cement and steel bars will be stolen, leading to increased construction costs. If a store has a "big house mouse," goods may be in short supply and prices may rise chaotically; if an enterprise has a "big house mouse," raw materials and finished products will disappear, causing losses.

"Thousands of miles of dikes can be breached by an ant's hole." If we allow these "house mice" to run wild, their audacity will only grow. Today they might steal a fluorescent light tube, and tomorrow they might steal a large timber; this time they might steal a batch of products from the factory, and next time they might steal a whole train car. If a country has these "house mice," you take a bit, they take a bit, the "holes" will only get bigger, and eventually, both the ideological and material dikes will collapse.

The reason why the common phenomenon of "house mice" stealing often occurs and is often overlooked is not only because our management system is not strict and there are loopholes to exploit, but also because in recent years, we have indeed relaxed our ideological and political work, lacking necessary social ethics and professional ethics education. In the eyes of some leaders, it seems that workers taking a bit of "old junk" is not a big deal; some even feel that criticizing someone for taking a piece of wood or a bundle of wire is "making a mountain out of a molehill"; and some leaders are afraid to offend these "house mice" and get a bad "report." As a result, "rat damage" is rampant.

If the "house mice" phenomenon is not dealt with in a timely manner, it will also affect the construction of the workforce and corrupt social morals. According to some units, due to the failure to timely address the "house mice," many people have openly joined the "house mice" ranks, causing the enterprise to suffer losses and even go bankrupt.

Currently, our country is experiencing a phenomenon of consumer inflation, which is also related to the failure to address the "house mice" issue. In the eyes of some people, as long as the public has it and it can be taken with ease, why would they spend money to buy it? These people use the "saved" money to buy other consumer goods, and such a large country will not increase the social purchasing power of scarce goods?

Therefore, while continuing to implement the rectification and regulation policy, we must also deal with the swarms of "house mice." The phenomenon of "house mice" that breeds disasters cannot be ignored any longer.

    治一治“家鼠”
　　袁玉康　唐建平
    最近，南京市白下区法院对七名内盗公共财物的犯罪分子依法进行了制裁。据了解，目前类似这样的案件呈上升趋势。社会上有个坏现象可称为“家鼠”。企业单位中尚未构成犯罪的小偷小拿现象，这些年更是日益蔓延，人们对这些“家鼠”内盗成灾的现象十分忧虑。
    毫无疑问，腐败必须治理。整顿大公司十分必要，但是，“家鼠”内盗，对国家、集体和人民群众的腐蚀危害也是不可忽视的。《诗经》里的《硕鼠》，讽刺的是剥削者。而如今一个单位的食堂有了一个“硕鼠”，那里的伙食就肯定搞不好，饭菜质量低而价格高就是必然现象。一个建筑工地有了大“家鼠”，那里的水泥、钢筋就会被搬家，造成施工成本的提高。一个商店有了大“家鼠”，商品就有可能短缺直至乱涨价；一个企业有了大“家鼠”，原料、成品就会不翼而飞，造成亏损。
      “千里渠堰溃于蚁穴”。如果听任那些“家鼠”胡作非为，那么这些“家鼠”胆子也就越来越大，今天拿根日光灯管，明天就能偷根大枕木；这次成伙在厂里捞批产品，下次就可能成车皮地去扒。一个国家有了这些梁上君子，你拿一点，他拿一点，“窟窿”就会越来越大，最后闹得思想堤坝与物质堤坝全面溃决。
    “家鼠”内盗这种常见现象之所以屡有发生，而且常常被视而不见，不以为怪，除了我们的管理制度不严、不时有空子可钻外，一个重要的原因，是这几年我们确实放松了思想政治工作，缺乏必要的社会公德和职业道德教育。在一些领导眼里似乎觉得职工拿一点“废旧物品”算不了什么大问题；有的甚至感到拿一根木料、一团线材批评一下也是“小题大作”；更有些领导怕得罪这些“家鼠”不得好“报”。结果导致“鼠害”猖獗。
      “家鼠”现象不及时治理，还会影响职工队伍建设，败坏社会风气。据有的单位反映，由于没有及时治理“家鼠”，不少人公开地进入了“家鼠”行列，致使企业亏损，直至垮台破产。
    目前。我们国家存在着消费膨胀现象，细想想同治理“家鼠”不力还有一定关系。在有些人眼里，只要公家有的，能够顺手牵羊弄得到的，他还能花钱买吗？这些人将“省”下的钱去购买别的消费品了，偌大的一个国家岂不又将大大增加紧俏商品的社会购买力？
    因此，在继续贯彻治理整顿方针的过程中，对成群的“家鼠”也要治一治。养痈遗患的“家鼠”现象，再也不能视而不见了。
