I will write about them.

They are two people together, not often meeting with more people, and sometimes even after a few years or leaving, they have not seen each other for a single time. Who are these people? They are the communication soldiers on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway.

From Sichuan to Tibet, there are countless large and small mountains on both sides of the road, and there are countless maintenance posts. Most of these maintenance posts are built at the foot of the mountains, next to the mountains and water. Although it is high and cold with oxygen deficiency, there are mountains and water for companionship, rarely climbing mountains, and not experiencing the hardships of shortness of breath, dizziness, and rapid heartbeat. The most difficult are the mountain-top maintenance posts, mostly above the snow line, with no water, no grass, no flowers, everywhere bare, all stones, and stepping out causes shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and chest tightness. There are no people within a hundred miles, and the black yak-hair tents of the romantic Tibetan nomads only pass by here once every few months. The truck drivers who travel day and night on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway are their frequent friends, but because they fear the harsh climate on the snow line, few people stop their cars here. One day, an old driver, purely out of curiosity, stopped his car on the mountain top to look at the iron shed by the roadside. Inside the iron shed, the walls were pasted with newspapers from a few years ago, already turned yellow and black by the stove inside, like the cover of an ancient book. The water for drinking is from the well outside, with a layer of green moss on top; in winter, it is mostly snow water and ice water. The rice is old rice from the granaries of Southwest China for many years, and the vegetables are all canned. If the fire is not frequently lit, the house is cold. Inside the house, except for two wooden beds, there is not a hint of human warmth. The old driver couldn't help but take a deep breath and asked, "Do you live here all year round?" The soldier replied, "A few years in the army, a few years on the mountain." Asked, "Besides repairing the lines, what do you do every day?" Replied, "In the morning, listen to the radio broadcast, during the day, count the cars, at night, count the stars." Asked again, "What do you think about at night?" Replied again, "I think of my mother, my sister." The old driver suddenly felt a lump in his throat and said, "You are truly the Mountain Kings!"

One night, there was another knock at the door. The Mountain King asked, "Who is it?" "Me." "What do you want?" "My car broke down on the mountainside. I have been guarding the car all day and night, not a single grain of rice has entered my mouth, please, soldiers of the liberation..." Open the door, start a fire, cook rice, open cans. The young driver ate a pound of rice and two cans of pork. The young driver slept on one of the Mountain King's beds, and the Mountain King curled up in the corner of the wall with his coat on. At first, the driver insisted on letting him have the bed, but the Mountain King said, "I have to check the lines in the latter half of the night, this way I can wake up easily." The driver believed him and soon started snoring. After this, the Mountain King ate less rice and less delicious canned food, thinking about when these drivers would visit again. Although the supplies were limited, this was not important, what was important was that they could come.

The Mountain Kings were too lonely and wanted to talk to the people passing by. One day, a bus passed by, and they stood outside the house, one playing the guitar, the other holding a fist as a microphone, intentionally or unintentionally singing towards the road. A few students in the car stuck their heads out and shouted, "Do you have water? Can we drink?" "You live here on the snow-capped mountain all year round, it's so romantic!" "It's so enviable!" The Mountain Kings also shouted, "You can come too!" So, the Mountain Kings and the people in the car all laughed. A girl also laughed. The girl couldn't see the face of the Mountain King, but the Mountain King deeply engraved her image in his heart, not forgetting it for days or weeks. However, that image was not entirely hers; they always saw the shadows of their mothers, aunts, sisters-in-law, sisters, and which Sichuan girl in that image.

Two years ago in July, I and a comrade set foot on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway. Due to the long journey, the jeep broke down several times, and we had to stay in a maintenance post at dusk. I remember the owner of this maintenance post was named Li Wenjiang. He said, "Before joining the army, I was tired of too many people, but now, after four years of service, guarding these telegraph poles for 1,460 days and nights, I realized how happy and fortunate it is to live with people!" I saw a book opened on his self-made "table," titled "The True Happiness of Life," with a few lines of lead characters marked with red lines jumping into my eyes: "To seek happiness for the majority, one often has to make self-sacrifices, even sacrifice one's life, this is the conscious action of a communist warrior..." I looked at this soldier with a black-red face, and my heart warmed up. He told me that he was studying university courses on his own. I asked him why he wanted to learn. He said with a shining face, "As long as the green mountains are there, there is no need to worry about firewood, after demobilization, I will struggle again on the road of life!"

The Mountain Kings, although close to the highway, get very few books and newspapers, only about two times a year. Each time, there are two large sacks and a large package of letters. At the beginning, they would shed a few tears of sadness for this "spiritual feast," but later they got used to it. This article should end now, what are the Mountain Kings doing now? It can be confirmed: they are still diligently guarding the mountains, guarding the cables and telephone lines leading to the interior.

Oh, the great Mountain Kings!

    我写写他们。
    他们是两个人在一起，与更多的人并不时常相见，甚至几年乃至离开也不曾见过一面。这些人是谁？他们就是川藏线上的通信兵。
    由四川进西藏沿路两边的大大小小的山，多得数不清，设置的维护哨也不知道有多少。这些维护哨大部分建在山下，依山傍水，虽说高寒缺氧，却有山水为伴，极少爬山，没尝到气喘、头晕、心跳的苦头。最困难的是那山顶维护哨，多在雪线上，无水无草无花，到处光秃秃，一律石头，出门就心跳、气喘、胸闷。这儿百里无人烟，那充满浪漫气息的藏族游牧民黑色的氆氇帐篷，几个月才转场路过这里一次。日夜行驶在川藏线上的汽车司机，倒是他们常见的朋友，但因为惧怕雪线上的恶劣气候，很少有人在此停车。一日，一位老司机完全是出于好奇，把车在山顶上停下，去看了路边的铁皮房子。铁皮房里墙上糊着几年前的报纸，早被屋内的炭炉子烤成黄黑色，像古书的封面。吃的水是屋外窖水，上面一层绿苔；冬天多是喝雪水、冰水。米是西南粮仓多年陈米，菜整个是罐头系列。平时若不经常生火，屋内就冷嗖嗖。屋里除了两张木床，没有丁点人情味儿。老司机不由地抽一口冷气，问：“你们常年住在这里？”兵答：“当兵几年，山上几年。”问：“除了维修线路，每日做什么？”答：“早晨收听广播，白天数汽车，晚上数星星。”再问：“晚上还想什么？”再答：“我想我娘，我妹妹。”老司机忽然鼻子发酸，一梗脖子道：“真是山王！”
    一天晚上，又有砸门声。山王便问：“谁？”“我。”“作啥子？”“我的车坏在山腰了。我，守了半天半夜车，没进一点米粒子，请解放军……”开门，生火、煮饭、开罐头。那年轻司机一下吃了一斤米饭和两盒猪肉罐头。年轻司机就睡在一个山王的床铺上，那山王就合着大衣缩在墙角睡。开始司机相让，山王说：“我后半夜要查线，这样好醒。”司机信了，顷刻鼾声如雷。这以后山王少吃了一些饭，少吃了一些可口的罐头，想的是不知何时这些司机们还会光临的。尽管储备有限，但这并不重要，重要的是他们能来。
    山王们太寂寞了，很想和来往路过的人说说话。一天，有一辆客车路过，他们就站在屋外，一个拿着吉他弹，一个握着拳头当麦克风，有意无意地朝公路方向唱。车上有几个学生打扮的男女探出脑袋，喊：“有水吗？喝喝！”“你们常年住在这雪线山顶，太浪漫了！”“太令人向往了！”山王也就大喊：“你们也来吧！”于是，山王和坐车的人都笑了。一位姑娘也笑了。姑娘不可能看清那山王的脸面，可山王把她的肖像深深印在心底了，几天几周不忘。可是，那肖像并不全是她了，他们总会从那肖像上看出他们的母亲、婶婶、嫂嫂、姐姐、妹妹和哪位川妹子的影子。
    前年7月，我和一位同志踏上了川藏线。由于路途遥远，吉普车几次出故障，黄昏时不得不在一个维护哨下榻。记得这个维护哨的主人叫李文江。他说：“没当兵前，就烦人多，现在四年服役期，1460个日夜守着这些电线杆子才体会到与人们在一起生活是多么快乐和幸福！”我看到他的自制“桌子”上打开着的一本书，篇名是《人生真正的幸福》，划着红杠的几行铅字跳入眼帘：“为大多数人谋幸福，往往要作出自我牺牲，甚至牺牲生命，这是一个共产主义战士的自觉行动……”我打量着这位脸庞黑红黑红的战士，内心一阵发热。他告诉我正在自修大学课程。我问他为什么要学？他脸上放着光说：
  “留得青山在，不怕没柴烧，退伍回家再在生命之途上拚搏一番！”
    山王们虽然多挨公路，可书报来得却很少很少，一年也就那么两次。一次两大麻袋和一大包信件。开始时还对这
  “精神聚餐”掬一捧伤心泪，后来也就习惯了。此文该结束了，现在山王们在干些什么？可以肯定：他们还是兢兢业业地守着大山，守着那通往内地的电缆线、电话线。
    噢，伟大的山王！
