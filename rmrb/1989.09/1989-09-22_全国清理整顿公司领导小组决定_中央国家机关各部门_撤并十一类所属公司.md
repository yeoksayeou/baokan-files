    Nationwide Company Rectification Leading Group Decides to Merge and Dissolve 11 Types of Companies Under Central Government Departments
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21 (Reporter Chen Yun) The Nationwide Company Rectification Leading Group has decided that central government departments must resolutely merge and dissolve 11 types of affiliated companies.

    This decision was made at the first meeting of the Nationwide Company Rectification Leading Group, held on September 5 and chaired by Vice Premier Tian Jiyun. The meeting produced a document titled "Opinions on the Merger and Dissolution of Companies Affiliated with Central Government Departments."

    At the meeting, Tian Jiyun emphasized that central government departments must take the lead in doing a good job of merging and dissolving companies and set an example for others.

    The 11 types of companies to be merged and dissolved are:

    1. Companies that do not meet the requirements for registration capital, personnel, business premises, organizational structure, and other conditions as stipulated in the "Enterprise Law" and its implementation rules.

    2. Companies that have been operating poorly for a long time, have incurred severe losses, and are insolvent.

    3. Companies that have serious legal and disciplinary issues and have lost their credibility.

    4. Companies within the same department or the same (parent) company that have the same or similar main businesses, or branches within the same city that have the same or similar businesses.

    5. Companies established by departments and their subordinate administrative agencies, government-administered units with administrative functions, mass organizations, and social groups using seven types of funds: administrative funds, institutional funds, special allocations, budgetary funds outside the budget, bank loans, self-owned funds, and raised funds. Individual companies that need to be retained must be approved by the State Council. Funds invested in companies from the aforementioned seven categories must be fully withdrawn.

    6. Companies and their subsidiaries established by direct (first-level) companies and companies under the jurisdiction of various departments.

    7. Companies that are affiliated with various departments, first- and second-level companies, and directly affiliated institutions under various names and forms without business management relationships.

    8. Joint ventures established by departments and their affiliated companies using their authority to engage in the resale of important production materials, scarce durable consumer goods, and state-controlled commodities and goods for profit.

    9. Companies that, under the guise of technology transfer, new product development, and knowledge services, actually engage in commodity and material trading activities in the circulation sector unrelated to the department's or unit's business.

    10. Companies established in the name of state organs, public institutions, state-owned enterprises, and collective enterprises, but actually operated by individuals or partnerships.

    11. Companies that the State Council and local people's governments deem should be dissolved or merged for other reasons.
