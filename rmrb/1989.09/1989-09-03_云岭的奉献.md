Yunnan's Contributions

Yunnan's flue-cured tobacco is highly favored by cigarette manufacturers across the country, and Yunnan cigarettes are renowned both domestically and internationally. Among the 13 nationally recognized superior-grade cigarettes, Yunnan accounts for 9 varieties.

Rubber from Yunnan

The Brazilian rubber trees introduced to southern and southwestern Yunnan have successfully broken through the northern latitude 24° limit for rubber cultivation, achieving large-scale planting. Last year, the province's planting area reached 182.6 million mu, with both per-mu and per-tree dry rubber yields ranking first in the country. Yunnan has become China's second-largest natural rubber base.

Winter-Spring Early Vegetables

By 1989, Yunnan's winter-spring early vegetable production had expanded to 30.9 million mu, yielding 6.02 billion kilograms of vegetables. Of this, 1.45 billion kilograms were sold to other provinces through state-owned commercial channels.

Sugar

During the 1986-1987 crushing season, Yunnan produced 5.58 million tons of sugar, a 23-fold increase compared to 1949. Sugar production in Yunnan ranks third in the country.

Tin

Yunnan's tin production ranks first in the country. Tin products from enterprises such as the Yunnan Tin Corporation have repeatedly won the title of superior products and are exempt from export inspections.

Electromechanical Products

Yunnan's electromechanical products are increasingly popular in exports. In the first half of this year, exports exceeded the annual plan by 25.4%. Kunming Machine Tool Plant earned $84.5 million in foreign exchange from exports last year, ranking first in per capita foreign exchange earnings among domestic peers.
