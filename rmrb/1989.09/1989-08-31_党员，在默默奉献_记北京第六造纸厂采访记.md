In today's rapidly developing commodity economy, has the image of a Communist Party member truly faded into obscurity? Has the spirit of selfless dedication of party members truly vanished?

The party members of the Beijing Sixth Paper Mill have given a powerful response to these questions through their actions.

The Beijing Sixth Paper Mill is located in an unassuming part of Haidian District. Over the past 30 years, through the hard work of all the party cadres and employees, it has grown from a small school-run factory with fewer than 100 people to a medium-sized enterprise with an annual output value of over 23 million yuan and annual profits and taxes of over 6 million yuan.

“Joy and sorrow are all within the employees”

As the factory director and secretary, Sun Meiyu oversees both production and the ideological and political work of the employees, making her a truly busy person!

Reform is difficult, as it touches the interests of some people and can easily offend a group of people. This requires courage, as well as dedication and sacrifice, especially in reforming the management and political work systems. The number of middle-level cadres was reduced, and a public bidding competition was held for these positions. Out of the original 35 middle-level cadres, 20 were to be reduced. Who would willingly be demoted? At that time, there were many who opposed it. Sun Meiyu launched a mass activity to "shape the image of party members" throughout the factory, first clarifying the situation, supervising party members to set an example, consider the overall situation, support reform, and at the same time, widely collect suggestions from the masses and promptly adopt them, creating a supportive atmosphere for reform throughout the factory. Through efforts, the bidding competition was successful. However, there were still some old cadres who had been demoted who came to see Director Sun: “I have been in the Sixth Factory for so many years, even if I have no merits, I have my share of hardships, and now you are just pushing me out like this, can you, as the director, bear it?” She looked at the old cadre with pain, how much she needed understanding, “If we don't set an example, how can we establish authority? Will the masses follow?” After several rounds of ideological work, it finally took effect. Soon after, the management layer was streamlined, and 24 people were "demoted to the people." Not long after, the entire factory successfully implemented the optimization of the labor combination in all departments.

“For what, after all?”

Two years ago, the Sixth Factory streamlined its organization, and middle-level cadres were to undergo a factory-wide bidding competition. At that time, as the director of the office, Zhang Ke was the first to stand up and, in addition to competing for the position of office director, also proposed to compete for the position of planning director. At that time, the original planning director, Old Li, was a veteran who had been engaged in planning and statistics for more than 10 years, with strong business skills, working diligently, and having a good reputation among the employees. Zhang Ke considered: reform must first have an atmosphere and create a situation. I am a party member and have the responsibility to take the lead and set an example. I have many advantages, and if I can take on the position of planning director, it can not only reduce the number of people but also be more flexible in grasping the overall production and operation of the factory. This is for the benefit of the entire factory! But this clearly means offending people. The competition results were announced: Zhang Ke won by a margin of 2.3 points and took on the position of planning director. At the meeting, he announced: “I have taken on the position of director, and I will continue to employ Li as an employee!” Back at home, Old Li recounted everything that had happened that day, and his wife was also unhappy. Old Li, however, thought about this issue for two consecutive nights. Under the guidance of Sun Meiyu and Zhang Ke, Old Li agreed. He said: “A party member should act like a party member, not just talk about dedication but act differently. Doing work cannot be calculated, one must be able to go up and down.”

“Two strong hands, an old yellow cow”

Guo Laidian is 58 years old this year. He started working in 1951 and said: “I am from the old society, and I have feelings for the party. The party tells me to do something, and I do it!”

In the face of reform, everyone is equal. This old party branch secretary, who has long been engaged in political work, was also deprived of his special cadre treatment. The factory intended to take care of him, but he insisted on organizing the lifting team and went to the workshop to become an ordinary worker. He never haggled with the leaders, saying: “A Communist Party member must first do his job!” Yes, he is in the power workshop lifting team, but as long as there is a shortage of manpower anywhere in the factory, he goes there to help. Everyone in the factory, from top to bottom, knows him.

“The factory's work is the family's work, no complaints!”

Speaking of this, he also took on the role of the factory's technical safety inspector last year. This "official" position was suggested and requested by him at the factory's meeting to commend party members with 15 years of party membership. He also declared: “No matter what position, I don't want any money, I guarantee there will be no problems.” Old Guo is like this, day after day, contributing to the Sixth Factory. Over the past 20 years, he has used his spare time and leisure time to take on part-time jobs, without pay, saving the factory nearly 100,000 yuan.

As an expert in operating and installing cranes, people outside the factory often ask Guo Laidian for help. Thousands of yuan are often placed in front of him, but he says: “I'm sorry, first, the factory has regulations, and I can't make this kind of unjustified money. Second, the factory can't do without me for an hour, I'm busy here, I can't leave!” For the sake of the entire factory, he politely declined. When Old Guo is mentioned, everyone gives a thumbs up: “Party members are different from the masses!”

    党员，在默默奉献
    ——记北京第六造纸厂采访记
    刘鲜日
    在商品经济日趋发达的今天，共产党员的形象真的就逐渐暗淡无光了吗？党员的无私奉献精神真的就销声匿迹了吗？
    北京第六造纸厂的党员以实际行动对此作出了有力地回答。
    北京第六造纸厂坐落在海淀区一个不太令人注目的地方，30年来，依靠全厂党员干部和职工群众的艰苦奋斗，它已由一个不到100人的小型校办工厂发展成一个年产值2300多万元、年利税达600多万的中型企业。
      “快乐和苦恼都在职工里头”
    作为厂长兼书记：孙梅雨一手抓生产，一手抓职工的思想政治工作，真是“大忙人”啦！
    改革是艰难的，要触及一些人的既得利益，也随时会得罪一批人，这需要胆识，更需要奉献和牺牲，首先是管理体制和政工体制的改革：精简编制，中层干部实行公开招标竞争，原来的35名中层干部要精简20人下去。谁愿意被精简下去呀？当时反对的人不在少数，孙梅雨在全厂开展“塑造党员形象”的群众性活动，首先弄通思想，监督党员以身作则、顾全大局，支持改革，同时普遍收集群众的建议，及时采纳，在全厂形成了支持改革的气氛。通过努力，招标竞争成功了。但是，仍然有被精简下来的老干部找到孙厂长：“我在六厂这么多年，没有功劳也有苦劳，就这样把我赶下去，你作厂长的忍心吗？”她不无痛心地盯着这位老干部，她多么需要理解呀，“咱不作出榜样，怎么树立威信，群众会跟着来吗？”连续几次的思想工作总算奏了效，接着是管理层的精简，24人又被“削职为民”，不久，全厂又在全部门顺利地推行了优化劳动组合。
          “到底为了什么？”
    前年，六厂精简机构，中层干部要实行全厂招标竞争，当时作为厂办主任的张忱第一个站出来，除了竞争办公室主任之外，还要提出兼职竞争计划科长。当时作为原计划科长的老李，是10多年来长期从事计划统计工作的老手，业务能力是很强的，勤勤恳恳地工作，在职工中很有威信。张忱考虑：改革首先要有一种气氛，形成一种局面，我是党员，有责任带头做出样子，自己具有很多的优势，如果能兼任计划科长，既可以减少人手，又有利于更加灵活地把握全厂的生产经营，这是为了全厂啊！但这明明又是要得罪人的，竞争评选揭晓了：张忱以多2.3分的优势兼任了计划科长。他在大会上宣布：“我兼任了科长，将继续聘李科长为科员！”回到家里，老李讲述了当天发生的一切，妻子也不高兴。老李呢？连续两个晚上都在想这个问题。在孙梅雨和张枕的疏导下，老李答应了。他表示：“党员总该像个党员，不能嘴上讲奉献，行动中却又不一样，干工作不能计价钱，要能上能下”。
        “两只硬苋手，一头老黄牛”
    果来田今年58岁，1951年就参加了工作，他说：“我是旧社会过来的，对党有感情，党叫干啥就干啥！”
    改革面前，人人平等，他这位长期从事政工工作的老党支部书记也同样被取消了专职干部待遇，厂里有意照顾他，他却毅然组织了起重队，到车间去当了一名普通工人，从来不跟领导讲价钱，他说：“共产党员嘛，首先就得干！”是的，他在动力车间起重队，但只要全厂哪里缺人手，他就到哪里去帮工，全厂上上下下，没有谁不知道他的。
  “厂里的活就是家里的活，没话说！”
    说到这里，他还兼任了全厂技术安全检查员呢，这个“官”是去年厂里召开慰问15年党龄以上的老党员会上他主动建议要求的。他还表态：“什么官也不算，一个钱也不要，保证不出问题”。老果，就是这样一天一天地为六厂奉献着。20多年来，他利用空闲和业余时间兼职工作，不计报酬，为厂里节约了近10万元的资金。
    作为起重机操作和安装的行家里手，厂外常有人请果来田帮忙，千儿八百票子常常塞在他面前，他却说：“对不起，第一厂里有规定，我不能发这种不义之财，第二是厂里一小时也不能没有我，我这里活儿忙，离不开！”为了全厂，他婉言谢绝了。一提起老果，大伙儿都竖起拇指：“党员跟群众就是不一样！”
