    China's large-scale afforestation activities, which began shortly after the founding of the People's Republic, have achieved remarkable results. Statistics show that over the past 40 years, the country has planted nearly 500 million mu of artificial forests, excluding the newly planted young forests in recent years. The area that has already grown into dense forests reaches 460 million mu, ranking first in the world.

    Due to years of deforestation for farming and the ravages of war, the old China left behind only a few primary forests in remote areas and vast stretches of bare hills. At the beginning of liberation, the national forest coverage rate was only 8.6%. Starting from 1949, the Party and the government organized large-scale tree planting and afforestation. Currently, China's forest area has increased from 1.24 billion mu at the beginning of liberation to 1.89 billion mu, and the forest coverage rate has risen to 12.98%.

    In the plains, which account for 40% of the country's arable land and population, the history of scarce forests and materials, and vast sand deserts over thousands of years has come to an end. Of the 918 counties in the plains and semi-plains that were virtually treeless in the past, 250 counties now have a forest coverage rate of over 10%.

    Particularly exciting is the progress in the "Three North" region, which has long suffered from water and soil erosion and sandstorms. The largest protective forest system in the world is being constructed there. After a decade of hard work, 130 million mu of forests have been planted. Some international experts on desertification have hailed this as an "amazing achievement."

### 我国四十年造林近五亿亩　人工森林面积居世界第一

　　我国四十年造林近五亿亩
　　人工森林面积居世界第一
    本报讯　我国从建国初期就开始的大规模植树造林活动，取得举世瞩目的成就。据统计，40年来全国人工造林除了近年新造的幼林外，已经郁闭成林的面积达4.6亿亩，居世界第一位。
    由于连年不断的毁林开荒和战火摧残，旧中国留下的除了少数交通阻塞地区的原生林外，就是大片赤裸的荒山。解放初期，全国森林覆盖率仅8.6％。从1949年开始，党和政府就组织大规模植树造林。目前，我国森林面积已由解放初期的12.4亿亩增加到18.9亿亩，森林覆盖率上升到12.98％。
    在占全国耕地和人口40％的平原大地，结束了千百年来少林缺材、沙荒漠漠的历史。过去基本无林的918个平原、半平原县，已有250个县林木覆盖率达10％以上。
    特别令人兴奋的是，在长期遭受水土流失和风沙危害的“三北”地区，正在建设世界规模最大的防护林体系。经过10年奋战，已造林1.3亿亩。一些国家的治沙专家称这是“了不起的壮举”。　（封加平）
