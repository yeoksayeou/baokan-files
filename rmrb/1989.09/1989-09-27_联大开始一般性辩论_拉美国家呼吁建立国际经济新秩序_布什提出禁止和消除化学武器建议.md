The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly began its general debate today. Representatives from 159 countries discussed major global issues and presented their governments' positions.

This general debate will conclude on October 13. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is scheduled to speak on September 29.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the presidents of Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil spoke at the general debate this afternoon, calling on the international community to address the deteriorating economic conditions in third-world countries.

Argentine President Carlos Menem stated that global insecurity is no longer just about nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers. New dangers include the widening gap between the rich and poor in the North and South and the destabilizing factors affecting economic development worldwide.

Venezuelan President Jaime Lusinchi called on the international community to establish a new international economic order to prevent serious damage to global political balance.

Brazilian President José Sarney urged the international community to adopt new strategies to address the worsening debt crisis in developing countries.

Peru's Foreign Minister also emphasized in his speech that the underdevelopment of third-world countries remains a major threat to world peace.

According to a report from our correspondent Liu Kai Chen in the United Nations on September 25, U.S. President George H.W. Bush proposed a phased plan to ban and eliminate chemical weapons worldwide during his speech at the UN General Assembly.

This was Bush's first speech at the UN since taking office in January. He said the United States is ready to immediately destroy 80% of its chemical weapons stockpile, and if the Soviet Union agrees, it will also reduce its chemical weapons to the same level.

Bush proposed that if the Soviet Union and the United States sign a chemical weapons ban treaty, the United States will destroy 98% of its chemical weapons stockpile within the first eight years of the treaty's implementation. If all countries capable of producing chemical weapons sign a comprehensive chemical weapons ban treaty, the United States will destroy 100% of its chemical weapons within ten years.
