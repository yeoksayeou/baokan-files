In 1976, 26-year-old Liu Wenbiao was transferred from the education sector to work at the Zouxixi Court. It has been 13 years since then. He is upright, honest, and dedicated, working selflessly and tirelessly, exemplifying the role of a Communist Party member, and earning the praise of local officials and the masses.

Neglecting Illness, Devoting Himself to Work

In 1983, Liu Wenbiao was assigned to the county court to assist the criminal division in handling criminal cases. He worked from dawn till dusk, traveling to the countryside to handle cases, sometimes walking nearly a hundred miles in a day. That same year, he began to experience severe pain in his upper abdomen. At its worst, he could not eat and would roll around in pain at night. The court leadership urged him to undergo a comprehensive examination at the county hospital. Doctors discovered that he had five large ulcers in his pylorus and duodenum. The court leadership had him admitted to the hospital for treatment, repeatedly instructing him to rest and not worry about work. However, he insisted on leaving the hospital before his ulcers were fully healed.

After leaving the hospital, he continued to work despite his illness, covering all 60 townships in the county. Together with his colleagues, he handled one important case after another. However, within a year, his old illness returned, and his condition was even more severe. Three ulcers in his duodenum had merged into one large area, and the two ulcers in his pylorus continued to spread, leaving him able to sustain life only by drinking a small amount of liquid. The court party committee quickly sent him to Changsha, where he was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Medical University. The county court's Director Chen, who had rushed to Changsha, repeatedly admonished him: "Liu, this time you must listen to the doctors. You cannot leave the hospital until you are completely cured." Liu Wenbiao thanked the leadership for their care but could not forget his work. As soon as his condition improved, he began to plead with the doctors. By the end of that year, he had left the hospital early.

Upon returning to the court, the leadership wanted him to take sick leave, but he insisted on working while recuperating. However, as soon as he touched a case, he forgot about his own illness. The previous year, his ulcer disease had turned into atrophic gastritis. Doctors repeatedly warned him that atrophic gastritis often precedes cancer and must be treated immediately. Friends and relatives, upon hearing this, became very worried and urged him to prioritize his health and not return to work. He, however, replied firmly: "Everyone must die someday. As long as I live, I must contribute to the Party and the people." He continued to devote all his energy to his work.

The following June, he contracted a rectal fistula. Due to a medical error, he nearly lost his life. Within two months, he underwent three surgeries.

Liu Wenbiao fought tenaciously against his illnesses. By the end of 1987, he had returned to his post. When he first returned to work, his rectal fistula had not yet healed, but he overcame the difficulties, carrying essential medications with him, working from dawn till dusk, traveling to the countryside to handle cases, determined to make up for the time lost to illness. This year, he also contracted hypertrophic spondylitis, making it difficult for him to turn over in bed at night. Nevertheless, he continued to work despite his illness, traveling to the six townships under his jurisdiction to handle cases. In early March, he went to Mazongling Township to handle an inheritance dispute. After dinner, he felt a sharp pain in his spine, and beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, his face turning pale. Chen Huazhu, who had accompanied him to handle the case, wanted to send him home to rest. But he thought of the difficult case that was about to be resolved and insisted on staying. That night, Chen Huazhu heard Liu's bed creaking all night. The next morning, as soon as it was light, he woke Chen Huazhu and they went down to the village, working until nightfall before successfully resolving the long-standing case.

Clean as a Whistle, Willing to Be an Upright Judge

Over the past decade, Liu Wenbiao has remained clean as a whistle, untouched by corruption.

Since joining the court, he has handled hundreds of cases for the people, but he has never accepted a meal from them, never taken a gift, and never sought personal gain. In recent years, some citrus farmers in Zouxixi Town, grateful for the court's protection of their legal rights, would send citrus to the court during the harvest season. None of the staff would accept them. Seeing that Liu had elderly parents and young children, the farmers offered to sell him some citrus at a preferential price, but he refused; when his mother and children wanted to eat citrus, he would buy a few pounds from the market. Every year before the Spring Festival, someone would send him some subsidized fish and meat and other local products, but he would rather buy market-priced goods than accept favors. Last year, a township enterprise, grateful for his impartial handling of a case, offered to give him a few hundred yuan in "hardship pay." He said, "Helping township enterprises solve difficulties is my duty; there is no question of 'hardship.'" He politely declined the enterprise's offer. This January, a plaintiff from Mazongling Township's Mucai Village sent him 100 yuan in cash, hoping he would speak on his behalf in the case, but Liu refused. Before the Spring Festival, this plaintiff sent him high-grade cigarettes, alcohol, and canned goods and fruits, but he patiently persuaded and sternly criticized the gift-giver, asking him to take the gifts back.

Liu Wenbiao is so honest and incorruptible, but his family is quite poor. The debt from his mother's medical treatment has burdened him with a heavy financial burden. In the past two years, his two daughters saw that many of their peers had tricycles and cried for their father to buy them one, but Liu, already in debt, had to disappoint the children. Once, his two daughters followed him into a store, standing by the tricycle display, staring blankly at the tricycles, and crying. Liu wanted so much to fulfill his daughters' wishes, but seeing the price tags, he could only shake his head in resignation and, with a heavy heart, pulled his daughters away from the store. Money was so desperately needed, but he had his own views on money: money could only be earned through labor, not through exploiting his power to extort from the people. In his 13 years at the court, he has refused countless times to accept cash and gifts from plaintiffs, earning the title of "clean judge" from the people.

Liu Wenbiao works selflessly and dedicates himself to his work. What does he seek? In his more than a decade at the court, although he has been named an advanced worker multiple times, he has declined several times, letting others take the honor. This year, his respected Director Chen was awarded the title of National Court Model, and the Provincial Party Committee called on all party members and cadres in the province to learn from Director Chen. Liu Wenbiao, taking Director Chen as his example, worked even harder, handling 88 civil and economic cases in half a year. For a person plagued by illness to handle so many cases, it cannot but make his colleagues marvel! Liu Wenbiao is such a person: his heart is filled with the interests of the Party and the people, leaving no room for himself. The people praise him as a dedicated judge!

    清正法官
　　——记湖南省桃源县陬溪法庭审判员刘文彪
　　陶远
    1976年，26岁的刘文彪从教育战线调到陬溪法庭工作，至今整13年。他一身正气，廉洁奉公，默默奉献，忘我工作，发挥共产党员的先锋模范作用，受到当地干部群众的称赞。
    不顾疾病　一心扑在工作上
    1983年，刘文彪抽到县法院协助刑庭办理刑事案件。他每天起早贪黑，下乡办案，有时一天就要步行近百里。就是这一年，他感到上腹部经常剧痛，最厉害时，饮食都不能进，晚上睡在床上也痛得打滚。院领导催他到县人民医院作全面检查。医生发现他的胃窦和十二指肠有五处大面积的溃疡。院领导派人把他送进医院治疗，反复嘱咐他要安心治疗，暂时不要考虑工作。可他不等溃疡病痊愈，就要求出院上班。
    他出院后抱病下乡，足迹遍及全县60个乡镇，和同志们一起办结了一批又一批的重要案件。然而，不到一年，他的旧病复发，病情较前更为严重，十二指肠的三处溃疡连成了一大片，胃窦的两处溃疡也在继续蔓延，使他只能靠喝少许流汁维持生命。院党组火速派车把他送到长沙，湖南医学院附属第一医院接收了这位生命垂危的病人。专程赶到长沙的县法院陈院长一再叮咛他：“小刘啊，这次你一定要听医生的，不彻底治好病，不准你出院。”刘文彪感谢院领导对他的关怀，但他忘不了自己的工作。病情刚刚好转，他就找医生软缠硬磨。这年年底，他又提前出了院。
    回到法庭后，院领导要他病休，他却提出边养病边工作，可是他一接触到案子，就把自己的病全忘了。前年，他的溃疡病转化为萎缩性胃炎，医生一再告诫他：萎缩性胃炎往往是癌变的前兆，一定要抓紧治疗。亲友们知道了也很着急，纷纷劝他身体要紧，不要上班了。他却干脆地回答：“人生自古谁无死？只要活一天，就要为党为人民作贡献。”他仍然把全部精力用在办案上。
    第二年6月，他又患了肛门漏管。由于医疗事故，他险些丧生。在短短的两个月内，他先后三次被推上手术台。
    刘文彪与疾病进行了顽强的斗争。1987年底，他再次回工作岗位。刚上班时，他的肛门漏管并未愈合，他克服困难，每天带着常用药品，起早贪黑地下乡巡回办案，决心要把被疾病耽误了的时光夺回来。今年来，他又患了肥大性脊椎炎，晚上睡觉也不能翻身，但他带病到辖区6个乡镇巡回办案。3月上旬的一天，他到马宗岭乡处理一起继承权纠纷，晚饭后，他感到背脊骨一阵阵剧痛，顿时，豆大的汗珠从额头上掉下来，脸也变成了铁青色。和他同去办案的陈华祖要送他回家休息。但他想到一起难案结案在即，不能半途而废，坚持留在了当地。这天晚上，陈华祖听到老刘睡的床吱吱呀呀响了个通宵。第二天天刚亮，他又叫起陈华祖一起下村了，直到天黑，才圆满地处理了这起老大难案。两袖清风　甘愿当清正法官
    刘文彪同志10多年来两袖清风，一尘不染。
    他到法庭工作后，为群众办了几百件案子，但他没有吃群众一餐饭，没有收群众一份礼，没有沾群众一点光。近几年，陬市镇的一些柑桔承包户为感谢陬溪法庭保护了他们的合法权益，每到柑桔收获季节，就给庭里送来柑桔，同志们一个都不收。群众看到老刘家里上有老，下有小，要用最优惠价卖给他一部分柑桔，他不同意；老母亲和孩子想吃桔子，他就到自由市场上去买几斤。每年春节前夕，有人要给他送点平价鱼肉和其他土特产，他宁肯到市场上去买议价货，也不愿沾别人的便宜。去年，有个乡镇企业为了感谢他秉公办案，提出给他补助几百元“辛苦费”。他说：“为乡镇企业排难解忧，是我的职责，谈不上‘辛苦’。”对企业给他的补助，他婉言谢绝了。今年元月，马宗岭乡木叉村一个当事人给他送现金100元，希望他处理案子时为自己说句话，被他拒绝了。春节前，这个当事人又给他送来了高级烟、酒和罐头、水果一类的礼品，他对送礼者耐心劝说、严肃批评，让他把礼物提了回去。
    刘文彪这样廉洁奉公，一尘不染，但是，他的家境却十分贫寒。老母亲治病欠下的债务，使他背上了沉重的经济负担。前两年，他的两个女儿看到很多同龄小朋友都骑上了童车，哭着要爸爸给她们买一辆，刘文彪欠了一身债，只好委屈孩子们了。有一次，两个女儿跟着爸爸进了商店，她俩站在童车柜旁，眼睛呆呆地看着童车，伤心地哭起来。刘文彪多么想满足女儿的心愿啊！可是，他一看价格标签，只得无可奈何地摇头叹气，狠了狠心，拉着两个女儿离开了商店。钱，对他来说，真是太需要了。但是，他有自己的金钱观：钱，只能通过劳动换来，不能利用自己手中的权力向群众索取。他在法庭工作13年，不知多少次拒收当事人送的现金和礼物，被群众称为“两袖清风的好法官”。
    刘文彪忘我地工作，无私地奉献，图的什么？他在法庭岗位上奋斗了十多年，虽然多次被评为先进工作者，但有好几次都被他推掉，把名额让给其他同志。今年，他所敬佩的陈院长被授予全国法院模范的称号，省委向全省党员干部发出了向陈院长学习的号召。刘文彪以陈院长为榜样，更是拚命地工作，半年就办结民事、经济案件88件。一个被疾病缠身的人能够办这么多案子，不能不使同志们发出惊叹！刘文彪就是这么一个人：他的心里装满了党和人民的利益，却没有自己一席之地。群众称赞他是一位默默奉献的法官！
