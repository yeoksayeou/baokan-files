Thousands of new brick houses stand tall in San Shan Island Town, Lai Zhou City, Shandong Province. Just nearby are the dilapidated old homes and the bustling fishing port. Who would have imagined that the fishermen of San Shan Island, who have relied on fishing for generations and weathered storms on their boats, could move into new homes in recent years! Local fishermen all praise the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    今日渔村
    上千幢新砖瓦房矗立在山东莱州市三山岛镇，就在它附近，是破旧的故居和繁忙的渔港。谁曾想到，祖祖辈辈靠打渔为生、风雨一条船的三山岛渔民，能在近年里喜迁新居！当地渔民无不称赞党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策。　高光德摄
