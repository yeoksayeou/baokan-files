Members of the International Verification Committee in Honduras Meet with Nicaraguan Anti-Government Leaders
A Nicaraguan Anti-Government Leader to Return Home to Participate in Elections

	Xinhua News Agency, Managua, September 12 - Tegucigalpa: According to a report by Western news agencies on the 12th, members of the International Support and Verification Committee met with three leaders of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces in Honduras. They listened to the leaders' views on the plan to demobilize the Nicaraguan anti-government forces in Honduras.

	The top military leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, Benavides, and two other military leaders said that as long as the political situation in Nicaragua changes, they will respect the arrangement made by the heads of state of the five Central American countries on August 7 regarding the voluntary demobilization and resettlement of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces.

	The International Support and Verification Committee was established last month by the United Nations and the Organization of American States in accordance with the agreement reached at the summit of the five Central American countries. It will be responsible for all work related to the demobilization and resettlement of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces and their families in Honduras.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, San Jose, September 12 - Nicaraguan anti-government leader Alfonso Robelo said in the Costa Rican capital, San Jose, on the 12th that he will return to Nicaragua on the 13th to participate in the domestic election activities. He is the first high-ranking leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces to express a willingness to lay down arms and participate in the elections.

	The 49-year-old Robelo, after the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, had served as a member of the first executive committee of the Sandinista National Liberation Front government. A few months later, due to political differences, he left Nicaragua to join the anti-government forces based in Honduras, where he became a major leader.

	Robelo said that after his return, he will join the National Opposition Union, which is composed of 14 opposition parties. The union had already nominated Violeta as its presidential candidate for the elections to be held in February next year.

　　尼反政府武装一领导人将回国参加大选
    新华社马那瓜9月12日电　特古西加尔巴消息：据西方通讯社12日报道，国际支持与核查委员会成员在洪都拉斯会见了尼加拉瓜反政府武装3名领导人，听取了他们关于遣散在洪境内的尼反政府武装计划的看法。
    尼反政府武装最高军事领导人贝慕德斯和其他2名军事领导人说，只要尼国内政治形势发生变化，他们将会尊重8月7日中美洲5国首脑作出的关于自愿遣散和安置尼反政府武装力量的安排。
    国际支持与核查委员会是联合国和美洲国家组织根据中美洲5国首脑会议达成的协议于上月建立的。它将负责所有关于遣散和安置在洪境内的尼反政府武装及其家属的工作。
    据新华社圣何塞9月12日电　尼加拉瓜著名反政府武装领导人阿方索·罗韦洛12日在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞说，他将在13日返回尼加拉瓜，以参加国内的竞选活动。这是第一个表示要放下武器、参加大选的尼加拉瓜反政府武装高级领导人。
    现年49岁的罗韦洛在索摩查独裁政权1979年被推翻后，曾担任过桑地诺民族解放阵线政府第一届执政委员会成员，数月后，因政见不同，离开尼加拉瓜参加了基地设在洪都拉斯境内的反政府武装，担任主要领导人。
    罗韦洛说，他回国后将加入由14个反对党组成的反对党全国联盟。该联盟已于9月2日推选比奥莱塔为参加明年2月大选的总统候选人。
