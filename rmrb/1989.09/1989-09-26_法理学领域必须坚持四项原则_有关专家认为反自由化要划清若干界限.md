The Chinese Society of Law (Jurisprudence) held a symposium today to seriously discuss the issue of "upholding the four basic principles in the field of jurisprudence and opposing bourgeois liberalization." More than 20 jurisprudence experts and scholars attended the meeting.

The participants in the discussion agreed that viewing Marxist jurisprudence as just one of many schools of jurisprudence, denying the guiding role of Marxism in legal research; denying that class nature is the essential attribute of law in a class society, and claiming that socialist law does not have class nature; advocating absolute democracy and absolute freedom, glorifying bourgeois democracy, and denigrating socialist democracy, etc., are prominent manifestations of bourgeois liberalization in the field of jurisprudence. These must be criticized clearly and explicitly.

Comrades exchanged views on the above issues and unanimously agreed that, in order to better criticize bourgeois liberalization, we must also be scientific. In determining whether someone is engaged in liberalization, we must look at their theoretical views as well as whether they have anti-party and anti-socialist political purposes. To carry out the criticism well, we must draw a clear line between liberalization and being influenced by liberalization, between liberalization and general erroneous views, and between liberalization and mistakes made in academic discussions. We must be objective and seek truth from facts. Different opinions on academic and theoretical issues should be resolved through academic discussions under the guidance of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.

Some comrades also mentioned in their speeches that criticizing bourgeois liberalization is a prominent political task for the jurisprudence community at present. However, from a long-term perspective, in order to consolidate the results of criticizing bourgeois liberalization, we must also pay attention to criticizing feudal ideology and prevent the emergence of ideological stagnation.

    法理学领域必须坚持四项原则
    有关专家认为反自由化要划清若干界限
    本报北京9月25日讯　中国法学会法理学研究会今天召开座谈会，认真讨论“在法理学领域坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化”的问题。20多名法理学专家、学者参加了会议。
    与会者在讨论中认为，把马克思主义法学看作只是各种法学流派中的一派，否定马克思主义对法学研究的指导地位；否定阶级性是阶级社会法的本质属性，说什么社会主义法不具有阶级性；鼓吹绝对民主、绝对自由，美化资产阶级民主，丑化社会主义民主；等等，是法理学领域资产阶级自由化的突出表现。对此，必须旗帜鲜明地进行批判。
    同志们在交换上述看法时一致认为，为了更好地批判资产阶级自由化，也要讲究科学。衡量一个人是不是搞自由化，既要看他的理论观点，也要看他是否具有反党反社会主义的政治目的。为了搞好批判，需要划清自由化与受自由化影响的界限，划清自由化与一般错误观点的界限，划清自由化与在学术探讨中失误的界限。一定要实事求是。对于学术理论问题上不同意见的争论，应当在双百方针的指导下，通过学术讨论去解决。
    有些同志在发言中还谈到，批判资产阶级自由化，是法理学界当前的一项突出的政治任务，但从长期来看，为了巩固批判资产阶级自由化的成果，也要注意对封建思想的批判，还要注意防止出现思想僵化。　（王礼明）
