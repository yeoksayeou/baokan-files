The Thousand Island Lake Must Not Be Polluted Anymore!

The Thousand Island Lake is located within the jurisdiction of Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province. It is scenic and has excellent water quality, meeting national Grade I standards, with the lowest sediment content among large reservoirs in the country. However, due to the recent construction of numerous factories in the upstream areas of Huangshan City, Tunxi District, Xuning County, She County, Yi County, and Qimen County, over 400 of these enterprises discharge wastewater. In 1988, the wastewater discharge from three districts in Huangshan City and Xuning and She Counties alone reached 280 million tons. The wastewater from the paper mill and resin factory in She County has made the river water black year-round. These pollutants slowly flow into the Thousand Island Lake via the Xin'an River. Additionally, with the development of the lake's tourism industry, the increasing number of boats on the lake has led to significant pollution from ship fuel and garbage.

Old pollution sources remain uncontrolled, while new ones continue to emerge. The reasons are as follows: some upstream regions do not recognize the importance of environmental protection, focusing solely on their own production development without considering the severe pollution downstream. Some regions still lack proper environmental management and monitoring organizations. The fragmented regional and sectoral management has resulted in a lack of unified management.

In recent years, the Chun'an County government has relocated some polluting factories around the lake and strengthened the lake's greening and sewage management. However, due to insufficient funds and institutional constraints, effective control of pollution sources and comprehensive treatment cannot be achieved. Large factories and mines that do not comply with management cannot be penalized. For instance, the Jiande Copper Mine discharges over 140 million tons of tailings containing copper, lead, zinc, and other components into the Thousand Island Lake annually. The county has issued multiple warnings, but there has been no significant improvement.

The Thousand Island Lake is not only a national key tourist scenic area but also the water source for the downstream population, especially for over a million residents of Hangzhou City. If pollution control measures are not taken promptly, the consequences will be dire.

### 千岛湖不容再污染了！

    千岛湖不容再污染了！
    千岛湖位于浙江淳安县境内，风光秀丽，水质很好，水体属国家一级标准，含沙量是全国大型水库中最少的一个。然而，由于上游黄山市屯溪区、休宁县、歙县、黟县和祁门县近几年新建了不少工厂，其中排放污水的企业达400多个。1988年，仅黄山市3个区和歙县、休宁两个县的污水排放量就达2800万吨。歙县造纸厂、树脂厂等排放的废水，使河水常年漆黑。这些污水顺着新安江缓缓注入千岛湖。另外，随着千岛湖旅游业的开发与发展，湖面船只愈来愈多，船舶废油和垃圾污染也相当严重。
    老的污染源得不到控制，新的污染源又在增加，其原因在于：上游一些地区未认识环境保护的重要性，只顾自己发展生产，不顾下游严重污染，有的地区至今还没有像样的环境管理和监测组织；地区和条块分割，造成管理体制的不统一。
    近几年淳安县政府虽迁走湖区周围一些有污染的工厂，加强湖区的绿化与排污管理等，但由于资金不足，受体制约束等原因，不能有效地控制污染源和进行综合治理；对那些不服管理的大厂矿也不能进行制裁。如建德铜矿每年都有140多万吨含铜、铅、锌等成份的尾矿废水注入千岛湖，县里已多次警告，但仍无大的改观。
    千岛湖不仅是国家级重点旅游风景区，还是下游人民，尤其是100多万杭州市居民饮用水的源头，如不尽早采取治污措施，后患无穷。浙江杭州市　许群　胡鹏程　方本昌
