Not far from Nanchang, in the county of Jing'an, lies the Maofu mountain range, which stretches across Hunan and Jiangxi. As soon as one enters the county, one is greeted by a series of rolling hills and peaks, as if waves are rolling in. The distant peaks are shrouded in a faint blue mist, while the nearby mountains are draped in a green veil. The air is exceptionally fresh, and one can't help but take a few deep breaths. The county's East Gate Mountain has over 500 acres of original forest, which the county has turned into a forest park. It takes only two hours by car from Nanchang to reach there. Naturally, on holidays, people flock to the park, and even those with just half a day to spare come to visit.

The park is home to over 300 species of trees, with lush foliage and towering bamboo, along with various exotic flowers and plants that capture the eye and elicit sighs of admiration. Following the stone path and climbing the steps, one reaches Dongling Mountain. The mountain is not particularly dangerous, but there is a small, elegant pavilion called Qinghua Pavilion. Because it stands out from the flat ground, and the mountain is lush and green, one can't help but take a breath and rest in the pavilion. According to the county's records, one of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties, Zeng Gong, once visited Jing'an, where he was inspired by the scenery and wrote the famous line, "Though it is a county of a thousand families, it is truly a place of purity and elegance." Now, the pillars of the pavilion bear two couplets written by later admirers: "The clear stream once nourished the flowery pen, the elegant valley once echoed the song of the plow"; "The two streams forever nourish the land of purity and elegance, the nine peaks forever sing the poems of the scholar." They are indeed fitting and natural.

Descending the mountain, one enters a path shaded by tall pines and cypresses, and soon arrives at the tomb of Kuan Chung. Kuan Chung (1383–1442) was a native of Jing'an. From a young age, he was well-versed in literature and had a deep understanding of the classics. He served as a minor official, but was later promoted to the position of magistrate of Suzhou during the Ming Dynasty's Xuande reign. He was known for his integrity and impartiality, enforcing the law strictly and bringing peace to the people. He was revered by the people of Suzhou as "Kuan Qingtian" (Kuan the Clear Sky). Folk artists have passed down many stories and plays about his deeds. In Jing'an, there is a story about a stone turtle carrying a seal. The story goes that in the play "The Fifteen Acres of Land," the character Xiong Youlan, who was not wrongly convicted, returned home and told his father, a famous stone carver, about Kuan Chung's deep understanding of the case and his efforts to clear his name and capture the murderer, Luo Ashu. One day, Xiong's father brought a finely carved stone turtle carrying a seal to Kuan Chung. Kuan Chung accepted this unique gift and placed it in the main hall of his court, where he could see it every time he held court. Perhaps he wanted to use it as a reminder to himself!

It is recorded in history that after Kuan Chung's death, his body was to be transported back to Jing'an, and 30,000 citizens of Suzhou lined the streets to send him off. However, during the Cultural Revolution, Kuan Chung's tomb was desecrated. The rebels at the time said that a clean official was worse than a corrupt one, and that there must be treasures in the tomb. When they opened the tomb and the coffin, they found no burial goods, proving that the historical accounts of Kuan Chung's "returning to his hometown after death, with only books and daily necessities in the boat, and nothing else" were not exaggerated.

Six years ago, the Jiangxi Provincial Government allocated funds to rebuild Kuan Chung's tomb. On the mountain top behind the tomb, a pavilion called Qingfeng Pavilion was built, with a stone statue of Kuan Chung inside, and two poems he wrote when he left Suzhou for the capital engraved on it: "With two sleeves of wind, I go to the capital, not taking a single inch of cotton from Jiangnan. I am ashamed of the people who see me off, and the wine poured before my horse flows like a spring." "Checking my luggage, I find it light, and the journey to Chang'an seems endless. Stopping my horse, I recall my days in office, and everything is worthy of the oath to heaven." Kuan Chung's official rank was not high, and he is not considered a great figure in history. It is only because he was diligent and honest that he has been remembered by the people. On the pillars of Qingfeng Pavilion, there are two couplets written by later admirers:

	Clean and upright, the waves of Lake Tai sing of the county magistrate
	High in spirit, the clouds of the embroidered valley remember the worthy man of the hometown
	With one shoulder of luggage, ask the feudal officials how many
	With two sleeves of wind, see how the magistrate of Suzhou does

Leaving Kuan Chung's tomb, one passes through a chestnut forest and enters a large cave. The morning sun shines in, casting a red glow, and the flowers inside the cave are in full bloom, exceptionally beautiful. Exiting the cave, one can overlook the Small Heavenly Pool, ascend the Xiya Pavilion, and admire the Golden Monkey Leaping over the Gorge. In the Small Heavenly Pool, a sculpted divine horse rears its head and neighs, as if ready to take flight. Below the Small Heavenly Pool, the clear and pure stream sings mountain songs and plays folk tunes day and night. Ascending the Xiya Pavilion, one can see the entire county city below, like a meticulously painted landscape.

Leaving the forest park, one can't help but close one's eyes and reflect: it cannot compare to the world-renowned scenery of Guilin, nor does it have the strange pines and rocks of Huangshan to boast about; it lacks the majestic view of Mount Tai, and it is not as mysterious as Mount Lu with its clouds and mists. Why then do so many people visit it? Is it perhaps because, in the natural beauty of the park, there is a historical element of remembering Kuan Chung?

    森林公园与况钟
    赵相如　何标瑞
    距离南昌一箭之遥的靖安县，属于横亘湘赣的幕阜山系。刚进县界，只见山重重，峰接峰，丘峦起伏不止，好似一浪一浪滚动而来。看远峰，飘着黛色烟霭；望近山，笼罩青翠雾纱。空气格外清新，忍不住要作几次深深的呼吸。县城东门山，有500多亩面积，原始林木不少，县里把那儿辟成了一个森林公园。从南昌只需坐两个小时汽车就可抵达。于是节假日不消说得，只要有半天之闲的人，也纷纷前来逛森林公园了。
    公园里天造地设的各种林木达300余种，林荫葱郁、修竹挺拔，加上种种奇花异卉，吸引着人们的目光，忍不住发出惊叹声。沿着石板小路，拾级而行，便登上了东岭山。山无奇险，却有一清华亭，建得小巧玲珑，因为在平坡上看去独占鳌头，加之山色浓绿欲滴，使人喘上一口气的同时不免要进亭小憩。据县志载：唐宋八大家之一的曾巩，当年曾来靖安游历，寄情于此间山水，写下了“虽为千家县，正在清华间”的佳句。现在，亭柱上有后人的两副楹联：“清溪曾润生花笔，华谷又传击壤歌”；“双溪永沃清华地，九岭长歌子固诗”。倒是写得自然贴切、恰到好处的。
    依山而下，转入苍松翠柏的林荫道，不觉来到了况钟墓地。况钟（1383—1442年）是靖安人，自幼饱读诗书，才优学博，当过刀笔小吏，后经人推荐，破格提拔，明宣德5年擢为苏州知府，可谓美差，且在任13年。但他为官清廉，刚直不阿，执法如山，除暴安民，被苏州人誉为“况青天”。民间艺人曾把况钟的政绩编成了不少故事、戏曲流传后世。在靖安还传说着一则“石龟驮印”的故事：那个在《十五贯》里没被冤死的熊友兰，回家后把况钟深入民间了解案情，为他平反、抓住杀人犯娄阿鼠的事告诉了他父亲，其父是当地著名的石雕工匠。一天，熊父背了一只雕镂精细驮了一颗印的石乌龟找到了况钟。况钟收下了这份奇特的礼物，将它放在公堂的大厅内，每当升堂理事时，就能看见石龟驮印。大概他是想以此自勉吧！
    史载：况钟死后，他的遗体要运回靖安时，苏州3万市民于长街为他送灵。可是十年浩劫时，况钟遭到挖坟的厄运，当时造反派说清官比贪官还坏，墓内定有金银财宝，当挖开坟墓揭开棺木时，里边什么陪葬品也没有，证实了史家说的况钟
  “卒而归葬，舟中惟书籍服用器物而已，别无所有”，并非夸张之辞。
    6年前江西省政府拨款重建了况钟墓，墓后山顶上建造“清风亭”，亭中有况钟的石刻像，并刻有况钟当年离开苏州赴京时写的两首诗：“清风两袖去朝天，不带江南一寸绵。惭愧士民相饯送，马前洒酒注如泉。”“检点行囊一担轻，长安望去几多程。停鞭静忆为官日，事事堪持天日盟。”况钟的官衔并不高，在历史上也不算伟人，只因为民操劳，清廉自守，一直受到人民的纪念。在“清风亭”的亭柱上刻着后人二联：
    清正廉明浪涌太湖歌郡守
    风高节亮云浮绣谷忆乡贤
    一肩行李试问封建官场有几　两袖清风且看苏州太守如何
    离开况钟墓，穿过栗树林，便能进入一个大洞，晨曦照入，红晖映染，洞内山花争艳，分外妖娆。出洞，还可临小天池，登楼霞阁，观赏金猴跳涧。小天池中，一匹雕塑神马，昂首嘶鸣，凌空欲飞。小天池下边，那明澈洁净的溪水，日夜不舍地唱着山歌，弹奏乡曲。登上楼霞阁，远眺县城尽收眼底，像一幅工笔山水画。
    离开森林公园，不禁闭目遐思：它既无法与甲天下的桂林山水相比拟，也没有奇松怪石的黄山风光傲视人圜；它既缺乏一览众山小的泰山雄姿，更无云雾缭绕难识真面目的庐山奇幻；为什么会游人如织、纷至沓来呢？是不是有一个很重要因素：在大自然的浑然天成中，掺进了怀念况钟这个人的历史因子？
