Today, the spokesperson of the Supervision Department announced at a news conference: Given that Comrade Liang Xiang has committed serious errors of abusing power for personal gain, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council recently decided to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his positions as Vice Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Member of the Standing Committee, Member of the Provincial Committee, and Governor of Hainan Province, and to continue the investigation into his problems.

It is reported that the Supervision Department, together with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the National Audit Office, with the support and cooperation of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government, has conducted a thorough investigation and verification of the problems of Comrade Liang Xiang. It has been ascertained that during his work in Hainan, Comrade Liang Xiang committed serious errors of abusing power for personal gain. He allowed his wife and son to engage in the illegal resale of real estate, with his wife securing two buildings in Haikou City and his son illegally reselling them for huge profits; he violated the provincial government's regulations on the approval of imported cars and personally approved the import of a batch of cars by a certain company, with his son, who did not participate in the business of importing this batch of cars, extorting a large sum of money; he used his authority to violate regulations and arrange for another son, who had not yet settled in Hainan, to go to Hong Kong for permanent residence; he violated financial discipline, using public funds to make clothes for himself and pay for personal banquets, and so on.

The spokesperson of the Supervision Department said that Comrade Liang Xiang is an old comrade who joined the revolutionary work in 1935. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council believe that in the past, Comrade Liang Xiang has done some beneficial work. However, in the new situation of reform and opening up, Comrade Liang Xiang abandoned the fine traditions of wholeheartedly serving the people and working hard, supported and condoned the illegal activities of his wife and son, committed serious errors of abusing power for personal gain and violating financial discipline, damaged the image of the Party and the government in the hearts of the people, and tarnished the reputation of reform and opening up. All Party members and state officials should draw necessary lessons from the errors committed by Comrade Liang Xiang.

On September 13, at the third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress, the delegates unanimously supported the State Council's decision to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his position as Governor of Hainan Province and to continue the investigation into his problems.

New China News Agency, Haikou, September 14: The third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress passed a resolution supporting the State Council's decision to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his position as Governor of Hainan Province.

The third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress listened to the report of the Presidium of the Congress on the State Council's decision to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his position as Governor of Hainan Province and the investigation report of the Central Joint Investigation Group on the problems of Comrade Liang Xiang. The Congress believed that during his tenure as Governor of Hainan Province, Comrade Liang Xiang committed serious errors of abusing power for personal gain, causing a bad influence. The State Council's decision to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his position as Governor of Hainan Province and to continue the investigation into his problems is completely correct. The Congress unanimously expressed its support for the State Council's decision to remove Comrade Liang Xiang from his position as Governor of Hainan Province and to continue the investigation into his problems.

    海南省长梁湘犯有严重以权谋私错误
　　党中央国务院决定撤销其党内外职务
　　对他的问题继续进行审查
    本报北京9月14日讯　今天，监察部新闻发言人在新闻发布会上宣布：鉴于梁湘同志犯有严重的以权谋私错误，中共中央、国务院最近作出决定：撤销梁湘同志中共海南省省委副书记、省委常委、委员和海南省省长的职务，并对他的问题继续进行审查。
    据悉，监察部会同中共中央纪律检查委员会和审计署，在中共海南省委和省人民政府的支持与配合下，对梁湘同志的问题进行了认真的调查核实。现已查明，梁湘同志在海南工作期间犯有严重的以权谋私错误。他纵容妻子和儿子倒卖房产，妻子出面在海口市预订了两栋房子，由儿子将其非法倒卖获取暴利；他违背省政府有关审批进口汽车的规定，亲自批准某公司进口一批汽车，他儿子没有参与进口这批汽车的经营活动，却借机勒索了一笔巨款；他利用职权，违反规定，为他尚未在海南落户的另一个儿子办理了从海南去香港定居的手续；他违反财经纪律，用公款为自己制作服装、支付个人宴请费用等等。
    监察部新闻发言人介绍说，梁湘同志是1935年参加革命工作的老同志。中共中央、国务院认为，过去，梁湘同志做过一些有益的工作。但是，在改革开放的新形势下，梁湘同志丢掉了全心全意为人民服务和艰苦奋斗的优良传统，支持和纵容妻子儿子的违纪犯法活动，犯了以权谋私及违反财经纪律的严重错误，损害了党和政府在人民群众中的形象，败坏了改革开放的声誉。全党同志和国家工作人员都应从梁湘同志所犯错误中吸取必要的教训。
    9月13日，在海南省召开的省人民代表会议第三次会议上，与会代表一致拥护国务院关于撤销梁湘同志海南省省长职务并对其问题继续进行审查的决定。
