    Export-oriented agriculture is thriving. Last year, the province's exports of agricultural products and their processed goods earned over $19 billion, an increase of 1.8 times compared to 1978.

    Reform and opening up have brought about a new situation for Guangdong's export-oriented agriculture. In 1988, the province's exports of agricultural products and their processed goods earned $19.25 billion, accounting for 26.8% of the province's total export earnings. This is an increase of 1.8 times compared to 1978. In the first half of this year, there has been a significant increase compared to the same period last year.

    Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, the counties and cities in the Pearl River Delta have actively carried out various forms of economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries. They have introduced a number of superior varieties, such as Egyptian catfish, cherry valley ducks, and western celery. They have also established shrimp and eel farms, as well as lean meat pig farms. Currently, the province has signed over 500 contracts for foreign cooperation in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, utilizing $4 billion in foreign capital. Over the past 10 years, the province has established 2,081 foreign exchange earning agricultural bases and processing enterprises. These bases alone can provide over $21 billion worth of export products for foreign trade each year.

    Guangdong's rural areas have initially formed a preliminary "agriculture-industry-commerce" system that integrates planting, breeding, processing, transportation, and exports. Since 1984, the 17 cities and counties in the Pearl River Delta region have seen an average annual increase of over 30% in the export earnings of agricultural products and their processed goods. Fresh milk exported to Hong Kong accounts for 70% of the total fresh milk sales in Hong Kong.

　　外向型农业生机勃勃
    去年全省农产品及其加工品出口创汇逾19亿美元，比1978年增长1.8倍
    改革开放使广东省外向型农业出现了新的局面。1988年全省农业产品及其加工品出口创汇19.25亿美元，占全省商品出口创汇总额的26.8％，比1978年增长了1.8倍。今年上半年又比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。
    改革开放10年，珠江三角洲各县、市积极开展各种形式的对外经济技术合作，引进了一批优良品种，如埃及鲶鱼、樱桃谷鸭、西生菜等，还办了对虾、鳗鱼养殖场，瘦肉型猪场等。目前，全省农林牧渔各业对外签订的合同已超过500宗，利用外资4亿美元。10年来，全省办起的创汇农业基地和加工企业有2081个，仅这些基地每年就可为外贸提供21亿美元以上的出口产品。
    广东省农村已初步形成了种、养、加工、运销、出口联成一体的“贸工农”体系雏形。珠江三角洲地区的17个市、县，从1984年以来，农产品及其加工品出口创汇额平均每年增长30％以上。销往香港的鲜奶，占全香港鲜奶总销量的70％。
