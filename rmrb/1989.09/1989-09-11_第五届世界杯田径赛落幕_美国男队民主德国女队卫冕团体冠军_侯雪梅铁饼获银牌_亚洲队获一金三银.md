The Fifth World Cup Athletics Championship concluded after three days of competition tonight in Barcelona. The powerful American men's team and the East German women's team each secured the championship with 133 points and 124 points respectively. The Asian team showed significant improvement in this tournament, winning one gold and three silver medals. The women's team ranked sixth, following the Soviet Union, Americas, Europe, and British teams. The men's team rose from the last place in previous tournaments to seventh.

In the men's 110-meter hurdles, American athlete and Seoul Olympics champion Colin Jackson competed fiercely with his old rival, Britain's Tony Jarrett. Jackson crossed the finish line first with a time of 12.87 seconds, surpassing his own world record of 12.92 seconds set on August 16, but the record was not recognized due to a wind speed exceeding 2 meters per second. Jarrett finished second, 0.08 seconds behind Jackson.

In the women's discus throw, East German athlete Ilke Wyludda won the gold medal with a throw of 71.54 meters. China's Hou Xuemei finished second with a throw of 66.04 meters, securing the third medal for the Asian team in this tournament.

Brazil's Olympic bronze medalist Robson da Silva won the men's 200-meter race and broke the tournament record with a time of 20.00 seconds.

Former world record holder Patrik Sjöberg of Sweden cleared a height of 2.34 meters in the men's high jump, winning the World Cup title and breaking his own 1985 record of 2.31 meters. The current world record holder, Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, injured his foot while attempting a 2.25-meter jump. After wrapping his foot with a bandage, he continued the competition and finished third with a height of 2.25 meters. China's Liu Yunpeng and East Germany's Dietmar Mögenburg both finished fourth with a height of 2.20 meters. World champion Saïd Aouita won the men's 5000-meter race, once again proving he is the world's top middle and long-distance runner. He currently holds the world records for the 1500 meters, 2000 meters, and 5000 meters.
