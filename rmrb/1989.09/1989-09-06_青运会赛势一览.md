**Overview of the Competition at the Youth Games**

Reporters Wāng Dàzhāo and Huáng Zhènzhōng

In the golden autumn of September, the Liaoning and Shenyang region is in its prime for competitions. Over 4,300 young athletes from across China have gathered here. Over the next 10 days, they will showcase their talents, providing a glimpse into the future of Chinese competitive sports.

At 8 AM on September 7th, the first event to kick off among the 16 finals will be the team tennis competition at the largest tennis court in Northeast China, the Liaoning Tennis Center. This sport demands high physical fitness, but on the registration list for the Hunan team, there is an 11-year-old boy named Hú Bīng. Whether such a young athlete can handle the intense tennis matches remains to be seen. The coal city of Fushun's sports hall is filled with dark green ping-pong tables. Will the "national sport" of table tennis inspire those exploring new techniques? The focus here is not on who will win the table tennis championship at the Youth Games.

Compared to the two small-ball sports, the two large-ball sports are more favored by the host. Recently, the Chinese youth team, which participated in the World Youth Football Championship, including key players Wú Chóngwén and Yóu Shàodōng, will compete with the Liaoning team in their first match. Several members of the Chinese Olympic team and the Chinese Youth team will also represent various participating teams. Additionally, the top four teams from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Liaoning will compete in the first round, and people hope to see who among these young athletes will stand out. In the basketball finals, known as the "giant sport," half of the female players are over 1.80 meters tall, and the male players are over 1.90 meters. The tallest players are Wang Zhidan (2.12 meters) from the Liaoning men's basketball team and Wang Fúyīng (1.97 meters), a 17-year-old center from the Zhejiang women's team. The new national team center player, Gōng Xiǎobīn, will lead the Shandong men's basketball team in their final match against Liaoning, where the two center players will compete for dominance. After the women's basketball team was disqualified, the competition for the women's basketball title seems less clear.

Inside the Liaoyang Swimming Center, the two most famous athletes of this Youth Games, Yang Wényì and Zhuāng Yǒng from Shanghai, who won silver medals at the Olympics, are not yet in their best form and may not set new records. However, they will appear in the first match on the morning of September 7th. Those lucky enough to swim with these strong competitors in the pool will certainly be closely watched by experts in freestyle and short-distance events. The Asian record holder, Cái Lì from Liaoning, is undoubtedly the most eye-catching figure on the weightlifting platform. However, the more urgent issue is the lack of successors in the lighter weight classes, which have been a strong point for China in recent years. The highlight of the track and field events may have passed with Jīn Bīngjié setting a world record, but in this "main melody" of the competition, people may truly discover talent rather than just focusing on the gold medal.

On the gymnastics, fencing, and judo courts, who will be the successors of Lǐ Níng, Lóu Yún, Luán Jújié, and Gāo Fènglián? Will they be able to take over the mantle? And for those Olympic events that have been held year after year but have shown little improvement, such as cycling, water polo, shooting, archery, and wrestling, will there be a new beginning in Shenyang?

At dawn on September 7th, the reporter, along with millions of people who are concerned about these issues, will begin visiting the 18 competition venues in search of answers.

    青运会赛势一览
    本报记者　汪大昭　黄振中
    金秋9月，辽沈大地正值竞赛好时节，中国体坛后备军4300多名小将来到这里。未来10天之内，他们将用自己的表现，为人们提供一份展望中国竞技体育前景的有力依据。
    9月7日早上8点，在东北地区最大的网球赛场——辽宁网球馆里，将进行16项决赛中最先开战的网球团体赛。这项运动对身体素质要求很高，但在湖南队的报名表上却有个才11岁的男孩，名叫胡冰。如此年少，能否胜任激烈的网球比赛，大概只有看过比赛才有答案。煤都抚顺的体育馆里摆满了墨绿色的球台，被视为“国球”的乒乓球运动在这里会不会给那些摸索新打法的行家们带来启发呢？因为他们注目的焦点并非谁将夺取青运会乒乓球冠军。
    与两小球相比，两大球显然更受东道主重视。不久前参加了世界少年足球锦标赛的中国少年队主力吴崇文和游绍东，这次随广东队出征，首战便与辽宁队遭遇。中国奥林匹克队和中国青年队多名队员则分别效力于几支参赛队中。加上第一阶段北京、上海、广东、辽宁四强同组相争，人们希望从激烈的拚争中看出这些年青人谁更是“材料”。在有巨人运动之称的篮球决赛场，半数女队员身高超过1米80，男队员超过1米90。辽宁男篮现役国手王治丹（2米12）和浙江女队17岁的中锋王福英（1米97）为巨人之最。国家队内线新秀巩晓彬打头的山东男篮将在最后一轮与辽宁队相遇，届时两位中锋国手将在篮下比试高低。解放军女篮被取消资格后，女篮的交锋形势似乎变得不甚明朗。
    在辽阳游泳馆内，本届青运会名气最大的两位上海姑娘、奥运会银牌得主杨文意和庄泳目前未达到最佳状态，很难游出新纪录。但是她们在7日上午第一场就要露面。有幸与泳坛强手同池破浪的选手，在自由泳和短距离项目中都会受到行家们“盯梢”。亚洲纪录保持者、辽宁的才力无疑是举重台上引人注目的人物，但是近年来我国拿手的轻级别乏人后继，已成为更迫切的问题。田径场上的高潮或许随着金冰洁走出世界纪录而过去，在这个运动会的“主旋律”中，人们恐怕真的要发现人才，而不是盯着金牌了。
    在体操、击剑、柔道赛场上，谁是李宁、楼云、栾菊杰、高凤莲的接班人，他们接得上接不上班，都该有个分晓。而那些年年赛、届届有，又总无多大起色的奥运会项目，诸如自行车、水球、射击、射箭、摔跤等，能否在沈阳开始新的起步呢？
    9月7日一大早，记者将和千千万万关注这些问题的人一起，开始依次到18个比赛场地去寻求回答。
