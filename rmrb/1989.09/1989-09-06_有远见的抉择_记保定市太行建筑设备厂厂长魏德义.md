Visionary Choices — A Record of Wei Deyi, Director of Baoding City Taihang Construction Equipment Factory

In the central plains of Hebei, Wei Deyi is a well-known entrepreneur. Over the past six years, this 48-year-old director of Baoding City Taihang Construction Equipment Factory has made visionary choices, starting from scratch and overcoming numerous challenges, leading the enterprise to develop step by step, eventually earning the "National Star Spark Demonstration Enterprise Award."

Wei Deyi was originally a deputy battalion-level officer in the military. In the spring of 1983, when he was transferred to civilian life, he gave up his "iron rice bowl" and returned to Shizhuang Village on the southern outskirts of Baoding to carve out his own path and create a business. Wei Deyi used his 470 yuan demobilization allowance to purchase equipment and raw materials, making every penny count. After renovating two old rooms, a workshop was established. He then recruited a few young villagers from the countryside, and with the sound of "clanging and banging," the small factory began operations.

The first batch of products was six generator sets. However, when they eagerly delivered the products, which had undergone strict testing, to the customers, they were met with a "closed door." Who would dare to easily accept products from an unknown small factory? There was no choice but to switch production. Unfortunately, the electrical control cabinets they assembled also met with the same fate.

These two heavy blows woke Wei Deyi up: if a factory does not have its own directional products, it will never have a chance to succeed.

An opportunity finally came. That winter, Wei Deyi obtained information that the Beijing Institute of Building Design had newly designed an automatic water supply device capable of pumping water from ground level to a height of 160 meters. He realized that this would be a replacement product for the tall and heavy water towers that were commonly built. Thus, he quickly went to Beijing and obtained the blueprints for this water supply device.

One blueprint brought new life to the dormant small factory. Wei Deyi and the workers braved the heavy snow to search for materials everywhere. Once, they discovered a type of tank head at a scrap yard, and when they asked about the price, it was 3.6 yuan per kilogram. Wei Deyi, as if finding a treasure, patted his chest and said, "We'll take all of these!" With the raw materials gathered, they still lacked technology. Wei Deyi went to Beijing to consult with experts and hired several "Sunday engineers" from Baoding. Five months later, the first hat-shaped automatic air pressure water supply device was finally born. Following this, they developed three specifications and six varieties of hat-shaped series automatic air pressure water supply devices. In August 1984, more than 100 experts from over 70 architectural design departments across the country conducted strict tests on Taihang Factory's products and gave high praise. More than ten users immediately decided to use this product on the spot.

Wei Deyi took the initiative in technological transformation, helping Taihang Construction Equipment Factory to reach a new level. They successively invested more than 500,000 yuan to purchase the most advanced modern production equipment in the country, establishing the complete machine workshop, rubber workshop, electrical workshop, and machine processing workshop. They also purchased X-ray flaw detectors and built a chemical laboratory. "Replacing old guns with new ones," they formed a complete set of modern production lines.

In terms of investing in the intelligence of employees, Wei Deyi was willing to spend money. Over the past few years, the factory has invested 150,000 yuan to train more than 60 professionals in automatic welding, chemical experiments, and enterprise management. They also sent 10 workers to universities for further studies. Currently, the training coverage of all employees in the factory has reached more than 60%. The factory also purchased a large number of professional technical books for employees to read and study.

Taihang Factory has 10 engineers, all of whom were recruited through newspaper advertisements. They took on important responsibilities in the factory and worked very actively. Wei Deyi often told the workers, "These intellectuals coming to our factory is not easy; we must respect and trust them."

Once, an engineer designed and manufactured a wave-making machine, but due to unreasonable manufacturing processes, it could not operate when placed in water. At that time, some workers said some unpleasant things. Wei Deyi worked on the workers, saying, "Engineers are not good at everything, and when they encounter unpleasant things, they feel bad. We should not add fuel to the fire!" Wei Deyi also had a heart-to-heart talk with this engineer, helping him to unload his mental burden. From then on, this engineer worked even harder to study technology and learned from workers with practical experience. He was welcomed by the workers. Wei Deyi's visionary choices time and time again brought new vitality to Taihang Construction Equipment Factory. In recent years, they have had new products every year. Just the air pressure water supply devices have formed three series and 10 specifications. The spherical and bladder series automatic air pressure water supply devices they developed and produced have successively passed provincial and national technical appraisals. Their structure and performance have reached the level of international counterparts in the 1980s, entering the international market. In 1988, the factory achieved a production value of 10 million yuan, and Wei Deyi was awarded the "Golden Cup Award" of Hebei Province's Reform Cup.

    有远见的抉择
    ——记保定市太行建筑设备厂厂长魏德义
    杨振武　张英杰
    冀中一带，魏德义是位颇有名气的企业家。六年来，这位48岁的保定市太行建筑设备厂厂长，以其富有远见的抉择，白手起家，闯过道道难关，使企业发展一步一楼，获得“国家星火示范企业奖”。
              （一）
    魏德义原来是部队副营职干部。1983年春，转业时，放弃“铁交椅”回到保定南郊史庄村，要独辟蹊径，创一番事业。魏德义将自己的470元复员费购设备，买原料，一个钱掰成两瓣花。两间旧房一拾掇，车间有了，再找来几个农村青年，“叮叮当当”，办起来小厂。
    第一批产品是六台发电机组。然而，当他们兴冲冲地把经过严格测试的产品送到用户门上时，却吃了“闭门羹”。一个名不见经传小厂的产品，谁敢轻易要呀！没办法，只好转产。不料，他们组装成功的电控柜又遇到了同样的命运。
    这重重的两闷棍，把魏德义敲醒了：工厂要是没有自己的定向产品，就永无出头之日。
    机会终于来了。这年冬天，魏德义获得一个信息：北京建筑设计院新设计出一种自动供水装置，能把水从平地打到160米的高度。他意识到，这将是一座座高大笨重专砌水塔的换代产品。于是，他火速进京，把这种供水装置的图纸拿到了手。
    一张图纸为沉寂的小厂带来生机。魏德义和工人们冒着漫天大雪四处“觅宝”。一次，他们在废品站发现一种罐体封头，问价钱，每公斤3角6分。魏德义如获至宝，一拍胸脯：“这些我们全包了！”原料凑齐了，还缺技术。魏德义到北京向专家请教，从保定聘请了几位“星期日工程师”。五个月后，第一台帽式自动气压供水装置终于诞生了。紧接着，研制出3种规格6个品种的帽式系列自动气压供水装置。1984年8月，来自全国70多个建筑设计部门的100多位专家对太行厂的产品进行严格测试，给予了高度评价。十几家用户当场决定使用这一产品。
              （二）
    魏德义从技术改造入手，使太行建筑设备厂跨上新台阶。他们先后投资50多万元，购置了国内最先进的现代化生产设备，建成了整机车间、橡胶车间、电器车间和机加工车间，还购进了X光探伤机，建成理化试验室。“鸟枪换炮”，形成了一套完整的现代化生产线。
    在对职工的智力投资上，魏德义舍得下本钱。这几年，厂里先后投资15万元，培训自动焊接、理化实验、企业管理等专业人员60多名，还选送了10名工人进大学深造。目前，全厂职工培训面已达60％以上。厂里还购买了大批专业技术书籍，供职工查阅学习。
    太行厂有10名工程师，是魏德义登报招聘来的。他们在厂里担负重任，工作都很积极。魏德义常对工人们说：
  “这些知识分子来咱们厂不容易，我们要尊重和信任他们。”
    有一次，一位工程师设计制作了一台造浪机，由于工艺制作不合理，放在水里开动不起来。当时有的工人说了一些不中听的话。魏德义给工人们做工作：“工程师也不是样样都会，他们遇到不顺心的事，心里难过，我们可不能雪上加霜呀！”魏德义又找这位工程师谈心，帮他卸下了思想包袱。从此，这位工程师更加努力钻研技术，并向有实践经验的工人学习。受到工人们的欢迎。魏德义一次次有远见的抉择，使太行建筑设备厂不断增添新的活力。这几年，他们年年都有新产品，仅气压供水装置就形成三个系列，10种规格。他们研制生产的球型、囊型两个系列自动气压供水装置，先后通过省级和国家级技术鉴定，其结构和性能都达到80年代国际同类产品的水平，打入国际市场。1988年，全厂实现产值1000万元，魏德义获得河北省改革杯“金杯奖”。
