China is a founding member of the United Nations. After the founding of New China, due to the obstruction of imperialist forces, our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations was long deprived. In 1971, the 26th General Assembly, with an overwhelming majority, passed a resolution to expel the Kuomintang clique and restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. This was a victory for the Chinese people and all the forces of justice in the world, and an important milestone in the history of New China's diplomacy.

After China's legitimate seat in the United Nations was restored, it continued to uphold the banner of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, anti-hegemony, and peace, development, and cooperation. It stood firmly on the side of the Third World countries, working together with the vast majority of member states to strive unremittingly to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, maintain world peace and the independence and sovereignty of all countries, strengthen international cooperation, and promote the development of all countries. Over the past decade, the United Nations has been an important stage for China's diplomacy. Our leaders have attended many important meetings and activities of the United Nations, using this international platform to expound on China's independent and peaceful foreign policy. In 1974, Comrade Deng Xiaoping attended the 6th Special Session of the General Assembly and delivered an important speech, comprehensively and profoundly expounding on the international situation and the stance on maintaining world peace and opposing hegemony. He also proposed important initiatives for establishing a new international economic order. Over the years, our foreign ministers have attended the General Assembly sessions annually, expounding on China's views on the international situation and its stance and initiatives on major international issues. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China has appeared in various fields of the United Nations with a more active and vibrant posture, playing an increasingly important role and receiving widespread attention.

Maintaining world peace is one of the purposes of the United Nations and the fundamental goal of China's diplomacy, consistently running through all of China's activities in the United Nations. China in the United Nations firmly opposes imperialism, colonialism, racism, and hegemony, supporting the Third World countries and peoples in their struggle to maintain national independence, defend national sovereignty, and resist foreign aggression, threats, and interference. After Cambodia and Afghanistan were invaded and occupied by foreign countries, China, together with other countries, sternly condemned such acts of gross violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms of international law in the United Nations. Under the promotion of China and many other countries, the United Nations has successively passed resolutions requiring the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia and Afghanistan, which have won the support of the vast majority of countries, isolating the aggressors. The correct actions of the United Nations have made important contributions to promoting the just and comprehensive resolution of these two "hotspots." China has repeatedly supported the Arab countries and the Palestinian people in their struggle against Israeli aggression, to recover lost territories, and restore national rights in the United Nations; supported African countries in their struggle against South Africa's racial discrimination and apartheid system and for the independence of Namibia; opposed foreign interference in the affairs of Central and South America; supported the Korean people's great cause of peaceful reunification, winning the praise of the vast Third World countries.

As a permanent member of the Security Council, China, in fulfilling the special responsibility of maintaining international peace and security entrusted by the United Nations Charter, has insisted on principles, upheld justice, and clearly supported the just struggles and reasonable demands of Third World countries in the Security Council. It has condemned various forms of aggression, expansion, and interference policies, calling for the peaceful resolution of international disputes and conflicts. For this, China has also repeatedly promoted the passage of many reasonable resolutions by the Security Council, enhancing China's prestige in the United Nations. Many countries have called for China, as an important member of the Security Council, to speak out more loudly on major international issues. In the 8-year-long Iran-Iraq conflict, China has insisted on the policy of "strict neutrality and active mediation," working with other members of the Security Council to promote the passage of Resolution 598, contributing to the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. In 1981, China, as a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power, correctly exercised its rights, choosing and supporting the election of a person from a Third World country as the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Stopping the arms race and achieving disarmament is a matter of universal concern to the peoples of the world and a goal for which the United Nations strives. China opposes the arms race and advocates a significant reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons, the prohibition of chemical weapons, biological weapons, and outer space weapons. While actively taking practical measures such as reducing the military by one million, China has also actively participated in the deliberations and negotiations on disarmament issues within the United Nations, proposing a series of reasonable suggestions and initiatives to promote the international disarmament process. Since 1986, China has submitted two proposals on nuclear and conventional disarmament for three consecutive years in the United Nations, pointing out that the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess more than 97% of the world's nuclear weapons and have huge conventional arsenals, bear "special responsibilities" for disarmament. They should stop all forms of arms races and take the lead in significantly reducing their respective nuclear arsenals and conventional arsenals, which is the only effective way to achieve genuine disarmament. The two proposals have been unanimously adopted because they reflect the common aspirations of the international community.

China attaches great importance to and actively participates in the international multilateral economic activities within the United Nations. It has always sympathized with and supported the reasonable demands and wishes of the vast majority of developing countries to reform unreasonable international economic relations and to struggle for the maintenance of economic rights. China, together with the Group of 77, has called on the United Nations to play its due role in establishing a new international economic order, promoting North-South dialogue, and promoting South-South cooperation. It has urged developed countries to make efforts to solve the urgent problems of debt, trade, finance, and development facing developing countries, so as to benefit the development of the world economy, especially the economies of developing countries.

With the implementation of China's reform and opening-up policy, the United Nations has become an important channel for China to strengthen and expand international economic cooperation, introduce funds, talents, and information, and promote the Four Modernizations. At the same time, China has also, within its capacity, provided technical and personnel training assistance to Third World countries through the United Nations system. China's effective cooperation in this regard has been widely appreciated.

In the fields of society, humanitarianism, culture, and international law, China has actively participated in the relevant activities of the United Nations. China has always advocated the principles of the United Nations Charter on respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, condemning the gross violations of human rights caused by racism, colonialism, and foreign military invasion and occupation, and actively promoting the protection of the rights of women, children, youth, the elderly, and the disabled. In education, health, science and technology, news, environmental protection, population, refugees, drug control, and anti-terrorism activities, China has carried out extensive international cooperation. From the peaceful use of outer space to the development of seabed resources, from scientific and technological cooperation to sports exchanges, from children's immunization to the prevention of AIDS, China's footprints and contributions can be found in almost all fields of the United Nations. Due to China's efforts and achievements in environmental protection, Comrade Li Peng and relevant officials were awarded the Gold Medal by the United Nations in 1987. China's activities in the United Nations specialized agencies such as UNESCO, the World Meteorological Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, and the World Health Organization are also becoming increasingly in-depth. In the legislative activities of the United Nations, China has participated in the drafting of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is of great significance to the protection of the marine sovereignty of Third World countries, since 1973, and has become one of the first signatory countries. So far, China has approved or acceded to more than 150 international conventions covering various fields.

An increasing number of Chinese people from various sectors have taken up important positions in the United Nations system. Chinese senior diplomats have served as the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General for 18 consecutive years. In 1984, China's distinguished jurist Professor Ni Zhenqiu was elected as a judge of the International Court of Justice.

China's practice in the United Nations over the past decade has established its unique position in this international organization, played its due role, and won the recognition and attention of the international community. Facing the new international situation and new challenges, China will continue to firmly implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy, further strengthen cooperation with the United Nations, and work with the vast majority of member states to achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations and strive for a lasting peace and common prosperity for the world.

    为了世界和平与发展
    ——中国在联合国
    郭纪炎
    中国是联合国创始会员国。新中国成立后，由于帝国主义势力的阻挠，我国在联合国的合法席位曾被长期剥夺。1971年，第二十六届联大以压倒多数票通过决议，决定驱逐国民党集团并恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。这是中国人民和全世界一切主持正义的力量的胜利，也是新中国外交史上的一个重要里程碑。
    中国在联合国合法席位恢复后，继续高举反帝、反殖、反霸与和平、发展、合作的旗帜，坚定不移地站在第三世界国家一边，同广大会员国一道，为实现《联合国宪章》的宗旨和原则、维护世界和平和各国的独立和主权、加强国际合作、促进各国发展进行了坚持不懈的努力，作出了应有的贡献。十几年来，联合国一直是中国外交的一个重要舞台。我国领导人多次出席联合国的重要会议和活动，在这个国际讲台上阐述中国独立自主的和平外交政策。1974年邓小平同志出席第六届特别联大并发表重要讲话，全面深刻地阐述了国际形势和维护世界和平、反对霸权主义的立场，并提出了建立国际经济新秩序的重要主张。多年来，我国外长每年都率团出席联大年会，阐述我国对国际形势的看法和对重大国际问题的立场和主张。十一届三中全会以来，中国以更加积极、活跃的姿态出现在联合国的各个领域，起着日益重要的作用，受到了普遍的重视。
    维护世界和平是联合国的宗旨之一，也是中国外交的根本目标，始终贯穿于中国在联合国的一切活动中。中国在联合国坚持反对帝国主义、殖民主义、种族主义和霸权主义，支持第三世界国家和人民维护民族独立、捍卫国家主权、反对外来侵略、威胁和干涉的正义斗争。柬埔寨、阿富汗遭到外国的武装入侵和占领后，中国和其他国家一道在联合国义正词严地谴责这种粗暴践踏《联合国宪章》原则和国际法基本准则的行径。在中国和许多国家推动下，联合国历次通过的要求外国军队撤出柬、阿的决议，赢得了绝大多数国家的赞同，使侵略者陷于孤立。联合国的正确行动为推动这两个“热点”的公正、全面解决作出了重要贡献。中国在联合国有关会议上不断声援阿拉伯国家和巴勒斯坦人民反对以色列侵略、争取收复失地和恢复民族权利的正义斗争；支持非洲国家反对南非种族歧视和种族隔离制度以及实现纳米比亚独立的斗争；反对外来势力干涉中南美洲的事务；支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的伟大事业，受到了广大第三世界国家的赞扬。
    中国作为安理会常任理事国，为履行《联合国宪章》赋予的维护国际和平与安全的特殊责任，在安理会坚持原则，主持正义，旗帜鲜明地支持第三世界国家的正义斗争和合理要求，谴责各种形式的侵略、扩张和干涉政策的行径，呼吁和平解决国际争端和冲突，为此，中国也多次推动安理会通过多项合理的决议，提高了我国在联合国的威信。许多国家要求作为安理会中重要一员的中国在重大国际问题上发出更响亮的声音。在持续8年之久的两伊冲突问题上，中国坚持“严守中立、积极劝和”的方针，与安理会其他成员一道促成安理会通过598号决议，为促使两伊实现停火作出贡献。1981年，中国作为安理会拥有否决权的常任理事国，正确运用自己的权利，选择并支持来自第三世界国家的人士当选联合国秘书长。
    制止军备竞赛，实现裁军是世界人民普遍关心的问题，也是联合国为之奋斗的目标。中国反对军备竞赛，主张大幅度裁减核武器和常规武器，禁止化学武器、生物武器和外空武器。中国在主动采取裁军一百万等实际措施的同时，积极参加联合国范围内有关裁军问题的审议和谈判，为推动国际裁军进程提出一系列合情合理的建议和主张。1986年以来，我国连续3年在联合国提出关于核裁军和常规裁军两项提案，指出拥有占全世界97％以上核武器和庞大常规武库的美苏两国对裁军“负有特殊责任”，它们应停止一切形式的军备竞赛，并率先大幅度裁减各自的核武库和常规武库，这是实现真正裁军的唯一有效途径。由于两项提案反映了国际社会的普遍愿望，获得一致通过。
    中国重视并积极参加联合国内的国际多边经济活动，一贯同情和支持广大发展中国家改革不合理的国际经济关系的合理要求和愿望以及为维护经济权益而进行的正义斗争。中国与七十七国集团一道呼吁联合国为建立国际经济新秩序、推动南北对话、促进南南合作发挥应有的作用，敦促发达国家为解决发展中国家面临的债务、贸易、金融和发展等紧迫问题作出努力，以利于世界经济特别是发展中国家经济的发展。
    随着我国改革开放政策的实施，联合国已成为我国加强和扩大国际经济合作，引进资金、人材和信息，促进我国四化建设的重要渠道。与此同时，我国也在力所能及的范围内，通过联合国系统，向第三世界国家提供了技术和人员培训方面的援助。我国与联合国在这方面卓有成效的合作受到了普遍的赞赏。
    在社会、人道、文化、国际法等领域，我国积极参与了联合国的有关活动。中国一贯赞成《联合国宪章》关于尊重人权与基本自由的原则，谴责种族主义、殖民主义和外国军事侵略和占领造成的大规模粗暴侵犯人权的行为，积极开展维护妇女、儿童、青年、老年、残疾人权益的工作。在教育、卫生、科技、新闻、环保、人口、难民、禁毒和反恐怖活动等方面广泛开展国际合作。从和平利用外空到海底资源开发，从科技合作到体育交流，从儿童防疫到防止艾滋病，几乎在联合国的各个领域里都有中国的踪迹和贡献。由于我国在环境保护方面的努力和成绩，1987年李鹏同志和有关方面负责人获得联合国授予的金质奖章。我国在联合国教科文组织、世界气象组织、国际电信联盟、世界卫生组织等联合国专门机构里的活动也在日益深入。在联合国的立法活动中，我国从1973年起即参加了对维护第三世界各国海洋主权具有重大意义的海洋法公约的起草工作，并成为首批签署国之一。迄今，我国已批准或加入了涉及各个领域的国际公约达150项左右。
    越来越多的我国各界人士在联合国系统中出任重要职务。我国高级外交官任联合国副秘书长已连续18年。我国杰出的法学家倪征?教授1984年当选为国际法院大法官。
    中国在联合国短短十几年的实践，已确立了自己在这一国际组织中的独特地位，发挥了应有的作用，赢得了国际社会的赞誉和重视。面对新的国际形势和新的挑战，中国将继续坚定不移地执行独立自主的和平外交政策，进一步加强与联合国的合作，同广大会员国一道，为实现联合国的崇高目标，为争取一个持久和平和共同繁荣的世界而努力。
