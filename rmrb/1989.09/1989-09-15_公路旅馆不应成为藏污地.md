Roadside inns should not become hideouts for crime

In recent years, along the 420-kilometer stretch of highway from Ganzhou to Nanchang in our province, there are thousands of restaurants and inns. However, due to poor management, many of these inns have become important hiding places for criminals and fugitives. Some gamblers stay up all night gambling in these inns. A criminal confessed, "As long as you give the innkeeper money, he will take care of you no matter who you are, even standing guard for you while you commit a crime." Some innkeepers, in order to attract customers, hire female waitresses. Many roadside inns are quiet during the day, but at night they are very lively. One local public security department, in a single night, caught more than ten customers and criminals in less than ten kilometers of roadside inns.

It is suggested that relevant departments take measures to prevent roadside inns from becoming places of vice and crime.

### 公路旅馆不应成为藏污地

　　公路旅馆不应成为藏污地
    近年来，我省境内赣州通往南昌四百二十公里的公路线上，就有几千家饮食店和旅馆。但由于管理跟不上，不少旅店成为犯罪分子和流窜犯隐藏的重要场所。有的赌徒通宵在店里赌博。有个犯罪分子在供词上说：“只要给店老板钱，管你是什么人，一律关照周全，甚至为你作案站岗放哨。”有的店主为了招揽顾客，雇用了不少女招待。许多公路旅店白天生意清淡，可是到了夜里却非常热闹。有个基层公安部门，一夜间在不到十公里的公路旅店里，就擒拿到十多名嫖客和公安机关正在追捕的犯罪分子。
    建议有关部门采取措施，不要让公路旅馆成为藏污纳垢之地。
