Corruption is universally despised. How to prevent and ultimately eradicate it is an important issue that we must constantly study and continuously address.

The following letters from readers focus on analyzing the mindset of those who engage in corrupt behavior, specifically their motives for engaging in illegal and disorderly activities. From this, it is clear that those who engage in corruption are primarily driven by an inflated sense of self and insatiable private desires. To eradicate the soil that breeds corruption, the key is to strengthen the ideological and moral education of all Party members and cadres, enhancing their immunity to various forms of corrupt behavior.

Firstly, Party members and cadres must be educated to withstand the temptations of money and material wealth. In the socialist stage, everyone has to deal with commodities and currency. On one hand, economic development cannot do without commodities and currency, and people's commodity consciousness, consumer consciousness, and values will strengthen with the development of the commodity economy. Production units and producers not only care about their production and exchange but also about the benefits they gain. To realize the value of commodities and protect their own interests, some people easily fall prey to the decadent idea of "everything for money," doing things that harm others for personal gain, embezzle public funds, and harm the country and its people. On the other hand, everyone needs to survive and cannot do without commodities and currency. This need for life is directly linked to personal desires. Those who seek pleasure and indulge in corruption, to seize money and material wealth, will resort to illegal and disorderly means. Corruption is thus bred using money and material wealth as bait. Therefore, during the period of reform and opening up, we must vigorously promote communist moral standards and Yan'an spirit to educate Party members and cadres, so that they are not swayed by evil winds and are not bewitched by money and material wealth, becoming noble and incorruptible individuals.

Party members and cadres must also be educated to withstand the temptations of power. Corrupt behavior generally occurs in the exchange of power and money. Why do people often come to the departments of the Party and government and to state officials? Because they hold various powers over people, money, and goods. Those who engage in corruption exploit the convenience of their duties to engage in illegal activities. "Position" becomes the prerequisite and condition for engaging in "illegal activities"; engaging in "illegal activities" is the result of abusing power. Therefore, we must educate Party members and cadres to uphold the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, to hold and use power for the people, and to resolutely oppose using power for personal gain.

To combat corruption, we must first firmly expose and punish corrupt behavior; secondly, we must work hard on prevention. Both "punishment" and "prevention" are essential. However, in the long run, we must focus on prevention and conduct regular education for all Party members and cadres. Each Party member and cadre should use the opportunity to combat corruption for self-education and self-reflection, examining how they handle money and material wealth and how they use their power.

### 增强思想上的免疫力

    增强思想上的免疫力
    腐败现象，人皆恨之。如何防止以至杜绝，则是需要我们经常研究和不断解决的重要课题。
    这里发表的几封读者来信，着重分析了一些有腐败行为人的心态，即他们进行违法乱纪活动时的动机，从中可以清楚看出，搞腐败的人，主要是私欲膨胀、贪得无厌的自我意识起了作用。要根治滋生腐败的土壤，关键是要加强对全体党员、干部的思想品德教育，增强他们抵制各种腐败行为的免疫力。
    首先，要教育党员干部经得起金钱物质的考验。因为，在社会主义阶段，每个人都要同商品与货币打交道。一方面，发展经济离不开商品与货币，而人们的商品意识、消费意识、价值观念又会随着商品经济的发展而增强。生产单位和生产者，不仅关心着他们的生产和交换，而且关心着他们所获得的利益。为了实现商品的价值和维护自身的利益，一些人很容易染上“一切向钱看”的腐朽意识，干出损人利己、损公肥私、坑国害民的事情来。另一方面，每个人要生存，食人间烟火，也离不开商品与货币。这种生活上的需要，又与个人的欲望直接相联。那些贪图享受、腐化堕落的人，为了攫取金钱物质，便会不择手段地干出违法乱纪的事情来。腐败，就是这样以金钱物质为诱饵在滋生着。所以，在改革开放时期，要大力用共产主义道德风尚、延安精神教育党员干部，使他们不为歪风邪气所左右，不为金钱物质所迷惑，做一个高尚的人，廉洁的人。
    要教育党员干部经得起权力的考验。因为，腐败行为一般都是在权与钱的交易下发生的。为什么党和政府的部门及国家公职人员会时常有人来找？因为手中掌握着管人、管钱、管物等各种权力。搞腐败的人，正是利用自己主管或经管某种职务权限内的便利进行非法活动的。“职务”成了搞“非法活动”的前提和条件；搞“非法活动”则是滥用职权的结果。所以，我们要教育党员干部，树立全心全意为人民服务的精神，为人民掌好权、用好权，坚决反对以权谋私。
    惩治腐败，一是对腐败行为要坚决揭露、坚决惩处；二是要用心治理，做好预防工作。“惩”和“治”二者缺一不可。但从长远看，我们一定要在预防工作上下大气力，对全体党员、干部进行经常性的教育。每个党员、干部要把惩治腐败作为自我教育、自我反省的好机会，看看在对待金钱物质和运用职权方面，做得怎么样。
