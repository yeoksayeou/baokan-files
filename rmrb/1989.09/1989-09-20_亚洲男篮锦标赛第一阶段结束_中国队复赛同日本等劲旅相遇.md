The first stage of the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship concluded tonight here. The eight teams that advanced to the second round are: China, Iran, Japan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India, and Chinese Taipei.

Tonight, the Chinese Taipei team played their final match against the Philippines in Group D. They performed exceptionally well, showcasing superior tactics and technique, and ultimately defeated the former Asian basketball powerhouse, the Philippines, with a score of 97:74.

The standout players for Chinese Taipei were number 6 Chu Zhiqing and number 8 Zheng Zhilong, who scored 32 and 26 points respectively. Both players are 20 years old. It is understood that Zheng Zhilong is a second-year student at National Chengchi University in Taiwan.

In the other three matches tonight, Saudi Arabia defeated Thailand 86:76, Malaysia defeated Pakistan 107:98, and Hong Kong defeated Bangladesh 113:45.

According to the competition rules, the eight teams in the second round will be divided into two groups for a single round-robin tournament. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals. China, Iran, Japan, and the Philippines are in one group. For China to avoid an early matchup with South Korea in the semifinals, they must secure first place in their group, which will be a significant challenge.
