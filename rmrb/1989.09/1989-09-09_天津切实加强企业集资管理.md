Tianjin has taken effective measures to strengthen the management of enterprise fundraising. Since April, the city has dealt with 38 enterprises that violated fundraising regulations by freezing their deposits, imposing fines, and returning the raised funds.

Due to poor management, Tianjin enterprises have also encountered some problems in fundraising. To address these issues, relevant departments in Tianjin have strictly controlled the quotas for short-term financing bonds, internal bonds, and medium- to long-term enterprise bonds. They have also restricted fundraising by non-production enterprises, state-planned external projects, loss-making enterprises, and enterprises with sluggish or backlogged products.

    天津切实加强企业集资管理
    据新华社天津九月九日电（通讯员张继明）天津市采取有效措施，切实加强企业集资的管理。四月以来全市已对违反集资规定的三十八家企业，分别作出了冻结存款及罚款、清退集资金额等处理。
    由于管理混乱，天津企业在集资中也出现了一些问题。针对这些问题，天津市有关部门严格控制短期融资债券、内部债券和中长期企业债券的指标，限制非生产性企业和国家计划外项目、经营性亏损企业、产品滞销积压企业集资。
