Title: In One's Position, Bear One's Responsibility

Jiangxi Province's Vice Governor Qian Jia Ming, who is in charge of the province's enterprise loss-reduction work, voluntarily fined himself 60 yuan for the province's "unsatisfactory" enterprise loss-reduction efforts in the previous stage and handed the money over to the provincial Economic Commission's finance office.

Zhejiang Province's Shaoxing City Mayor, in view of the fact that multiple production and traffic accidents occurred in the city in the first quarter of this year, causing certain losses, announced that he would deduct 15 yuan from his own salary each month for the next five months to take responsibility for these accidents.

Two examples of "leaders punishing themselves" from different places, reported through the news media, have recently become a hot topic. People generally give them high evaluations. As one signed commentary said: "The mayor himself announces punishment for himself. Although the amount of money is not much, the significance is great. It reflects a spirit of daring to take responsibility among our cadres, a spirit of strict self-discipline. If all our cadres at various levels had this spirit, then our work would be well done. Production, traffic, and everything else would have a bright future."

Yes, perhaps it is this point that made these two originally very ordinary incidents cause such a strong response from people, reflecting the broad masses of the people's demand for our leaders at various levels. At present, when various local party and government departments are carrying out anti-corruption and strengthening clean government construction, this demand is even more urgent and pressing. The author once heard a cadre who has worked at the grassroots level for many years say, "Now in some places, when problems occur below, not only do higher-level leaders not take the initiative to take responsibility, but even when the problem is in the leadership department itself, when it comes to investigating responsibility, it is often left unresolved." The words may be a bit extreme, but such phenomena do indeed exist to varying degrees in some places and departments.

In fact, the masses' demand for cadres is also something that our party and government have always advocated and required, but it has been neglected by some comrades for a period of time. Or, in some places, although it is considered when evaluating and appointing cadres, due to the lack of a clear and specific regulation and system, leadership responsibility is difficult to implement. In addition, some people like to boast of achievements and report good news but not bad news. Although there are many problems in those places and departments and the masses have many complaints, in the leaders' work reports, there are still numerous achievements and brilliant achievements.

The deeper reason for the existence of this phenomenon is probably that some leading departments have a situation where responsibilities are unclear and positions are not linked to responsibilities. As a leader of a region or department, no matter what happens below, no matter how much loss is caused to the state, he can still be a stable "peaceful official." This situation needs to be changed.

It is hoped that through "self-punishment" to implement leadership responsibility, this spirit is good. But this is certainly not enough to fundamentally eliminate the above-mentioned phenomena. In view of this, the author believes that the key is to quickly form a set of clear, specific, and feasible regulations for handling leadership work errors that suit China's national conditions, so that cadres at all levels can refer to and implement when taking responsibility for leadership. At that time, whether it is "self-punishment" or organizational punishment, it can be done in accordance with the regulations. In this way, it can be truly guaranteed that every comrade in a leadership position can do: in one's position, handle one's affairs, and bear one's responsibility.

    在其位  负其责
    许伯贤
    江西省分管企业扭亏工作的副省长钱家铭同志，为前一阶段该省企业“扭亏不尽如人意”而自愿认罚，主动把60元钱上交省经委财办。
    浙江省绍兴市市长鉴于今年第一季度全市发生多起生产和交通事故，造成一定损失，自己宣布：在以后5个月里，每月扣发本人工资15元，以示对这些事故承担领导责任。
    发生在两个不同地方的“领导自罚”事例，通过新闻媒介的报道，一时成了新鲜话题，人们普遍给予较高的评价。诚如一篇署名评论所说：“市长自己宣布处罚自己，钱款虽不多，意义却不小，它反映了我们干部的一种勇于负责的精神，一种严于律己的态度。如果我们的各级干部都有这种精神，则我们的事情就能办好，生产、交通，以至一切的一切，就大有前途了。”
    是的，也许正是这一点，使这两件本来很平常的事情，引起了人们的热烈反响，从中也反映了广大人民群众对我们的各级领导干部的一种要求。在目前各地党政部门开展反腐败和加强廉政建设时，这种要求显得更为强烈和迫切。笔者曾听一位在基层工作多年的干部这样说，如今有些地方，下面出了问题，不要说上级领导主动承担领导责任，就是问题出在领导部门本身，追究起来也往往是不了了之。话是说得偏激了点，但这类现象在一些地方和部门确实不同程度地存在着。
    其实，人民群众对领导干部的这种要求，也是我们党和政府一直提倡和要求的，只是一个时期来被一些同志忽视了。或者说，有的地方虽然在考核、任用干部时有所考虑，但由于缺少一种明确、具体的规定和制度，领导责任就很难落到实处。再加上有些人好大喜功，报喜不报忧，尽管那些地方和部门问题成堆，群众意见很大，而在领导者的述职报告里，依然是成果累累，政绩辉煌。
    这种现象的存在，更深层的原因，恐怕还在于一些领导部门存在着责任不明、职位与责任不相挂钩的状况。身为一个地区或部门的领导人，无论下面出了什么事，给国家造成了多少损失，他却依然能稳当“太平官”。这种状况亟待改变。
    期望通过“自罚”来落实领导责任，这种精神是好的。但这毕竟不可能从根本上消除上述现象。有鉴于此，笔者以为，关键的问题是，要尽快形成适合我国国情的一套明确、具体、可行的领导工作失误处置法规，便于各级领导干部在承担领导责任时参照执行。届时，不管是“自罚”还是由组织处罚，都能做到有章可循。这样，才能切实保证每一个处在领导地位的同志真正做到：在其位，谋其事，负其责。
