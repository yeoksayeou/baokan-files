On September 6th, the renowned French television host Danièle Gilbert was detained in Nice prison for using her name and photograph in a fraudulent advertisement.

Reports indicate that over the past year, her photograph appeared in a mail-order advertisement for a ring. The advertisement claimed that the ring, featuring a human-faced eagle design, possessed magical properties, capable of warding off evil and bringing good fortune. Wearing it, one would encounter lucky events within 30 days, with the value of these events being at least a hundred times the price of the ring. If nothing happened within 30 days, the ring could be returned to the mail-order company, and the money would be refunded in full. The advertisement also stated that Danièle Gilbert had used this ring to avoid a near-fatal accident. This advertisement deceived many people. Numerous mail-order customers bought the ring but did not experience any good fortune, and when they returned the ring, they did not receive their refunds. Eventually, they decided to take legal action.

In France, where commercial competition is fierce, unscrupulous businessmen resort to various means to make huge profits. According to investigations by the judicial authorities, the cost of producing this ring was only 3 francs, but it was sold for 189 francs. In less than two years, over 400,000 rings were sold, generating profits of over 80 million francs.

After the truth was exposed, the creator of the advertisement was imprisoned, and the aforementioned female television host may face a sentence of 3 months to 1 year in prison and a fine of up to 30,000 francs.

    弄巧成拙　戒指惹祸
    9月6日，法国知名的电视节目主持人达妮厄勒·吉尔伯尔因以自己的名字和照片作假广告，被拘于尼斯监狱。
    据报道，去年以来，她的照片出现在一则推销戒指的邮购广告中。该广告称：这只人身鹰面图案的戒指具有魔力，能避邪迎吉。戴上它，不出30天就会遇到幸运的事，其价值至少百倍于戒指的价格。若30天内没有应验，可把戒指退给邮购公司，钱将如数归还。广告还称，达妮厄勒·吉尔伯尔凭借这种戒指，躲过了一次险些丧命的意外事件。这则广告使许多人上了当。不少邮购者购买了戒指却未获佳音，退回了戒指又收不到退款。他们最后决定诉诸法律。
    在商业竞争激烈的法国，不法商人不择手段牟取暴利。据司法部门调查，这种戒指成本仅3法郎，售价却高达189法郎，在不到两年时间内，共售出40多万只，获利8000多万法郎。
    事情败露后，广告发明者锒铛入狱，上面那位女电视节目主持人有可能因此被判3个月到1年的徒刑和最高达3万法郎的罚款。　		（魏玉琴）
