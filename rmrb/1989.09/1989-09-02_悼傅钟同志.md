The sad news of Comrade Fu's passing has reached us, and my heart is filled with sorrow. Throughout the Long March, he overcame countless enemies, and his life was dedicated to the revolution and loyalty to the Party. He served as a deputy for his entire life, always willing to be an assistant. When the time comes to assess his life, he will be remembered as an excellent general. No one is perfect in this world, but I praise Comrade Fu as a model for all of us.

[Note] Comrade Fu Zhong once said, "Others call me Director Fu, but I am a deputy director. I am happy to be a deputy director, to be an assistant, and I am content to be an assistant for life.

    悼傅钟同志
    李中权噩耗传来傅老逝，哀思浸透吾心房。长征万里克强敌，革命一生忠于党。副职终身作助手〔注〕，盖棺论定好上将。世间本无完人在，我颂钟公为榜样。〔注〕傅钟同志生前说过，别人叫我傅主任，我是副主任。我乐于当副主任，作助手，一辈子乐于作助手。
