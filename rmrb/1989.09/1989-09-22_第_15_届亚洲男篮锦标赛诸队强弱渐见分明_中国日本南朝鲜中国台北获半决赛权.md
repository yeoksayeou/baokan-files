The 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship: Teams' Strengths and Weaknesses Become Clear
China, Japan, South Korea, and Chinese Taipei Secure Semifinal Spots

BEIJING, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) — Despite the fact that the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship's second round will continue tomorrow, China, Japan, South Korea, and Chinese Taipei have already secured their spots in the semifinals.

The Chinese team, in tonight's match against Iran at the University Gymnasium, had all 12 players take the field, rotating in and out, and ultimately defeated Iran with a score of 115:72. The halftime score was 60:35.

The South Korean team, in their match against Saudi Arabia, narrowly avoided an upset. They trailed by one point at halftime, 42:43, and only managed to win by a slim margin of 85:83. Local experts believe that South Korea may have been deliberately holding back, and they will likely show their full strength when they face China. The Chinese Taipei team is also a formidable opponent, with their players performing exceptionally well in the previous matches.

Japan defeated the Philippines with a score of 86:67, and Chinese Taipei defeated India with a score of 95:73. Tomorrow, the final few second-round matches of this championship will be played, with China facing Japan and Chinese Taipei facing South Korea. It is expected that all teams will give their best efforts to secure the top spot in their groups and advance to the next round.

    第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛诸队强弱渐见分明
    中国日本南朝鲜中国台北获半决赛权
    本报北京9月21日讯　记者陈昭报道：尽管第十五届亚洲男篮锦标赛复赛明日还要再赛一天，但中国、日本、南朝鲜和中国台北队已稳获半决赛权。
    中国队今晚在大学生体育馆进行的对伊朗队的比赛中，12名队员全部亮相轮番上阵，最后以115∶72击败伊朗队。上半时比分为60∶35。
    南朝鲜队在与沙特阿拉伯队的比赛中，却险些阴沟翻船，上半时以42∶43落后一分，直至终场锣响，南朝鲜队才以85∶83的一球微弱优势获胜。此间行家认为，南朝鲜队可能故弄玄虚，他们须到与中国队交锋时才使出全力。中国台北队也是一支不可小觑的队伍，在前几场比赛中，中国台北队员表现得很出色。
    日本队以86∶67胜菲律宾队，中国台北队以95∶73胜印度队。明日将进行本届锦标赛的最后几场复赛，将由中国队对日本队，中国台北队对南朝鲜队，想必各队均要使出混身解数，力争以小组第一的身份出线。
