Some place names in our country appear to be in Han Chinese but are actually translations of non-Han languages. People often interpret these names literally, leading to misunderstandings.

People usually recognize that place names like Urumqi, Karamay, Hohhot, Hailar, Qiqihar, and Harbin are not in Han Chinese. However, some two-character place names in inland regions are also non-Han words translated into Han characters.

Today, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, there are still many county and city names that originated from the Yue language during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The character "zhou" in Suzhou and Hangzhou is Han Chinese, but "Su" and "Hang" are Yue language words. Additionally, places like Wuxi, Jurong, Yuxian, Yuhang, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Zhuji are all Yue language names. These Yue language place names were given Han characters during the Qin and Han dynasties, and their original meanings in Yue language are largely unknown to the local Han people. Therefore, when Wang Mang changed the names of counties and prefectures, he changed Wuxi to Youxi, indicating that he interpreted Wuxi based on the Han character meaning. Liu Xiu restored the Han dynasty and reversed all the name changes made by Wang Mang, changing Youxi back to Wuxi. With these two name changes, later generations interpreted the names literally and created a story: During the Zhou and Qin periods, the area produced tin, so the name was Tin Mountain; during the Han dynasty, the tin was depleted, so the county was named Wuxi; during Wang Mang's time, tin was produced again, so the county name was changed to Youxi; during the Eastern Han dynasty, the tin was depleted again, so the name was changed back to Wuxi. Many records and local chronicles adopted this explanation, and it spread widely among the people.

Not only are some southern place names misinterpreted, but some northern place names also originate from ancient Hu languages.

    寸寸山河　寸寸知识
    ——谭其骧教授谈中国非汉语地名
    我国有些地名貌似汉语，实际乃是非汉语的汉译，而人们常按汉字望文生义，强事诠释，以致造成讹误。
    人们通常看到乌鲁木齐、克拉玛依、呼和浩特、和林格尔、齐齐哈尔、海拉尔、哈尔滨等地名，都易理会到这不是汉语地名。但有些内地两字地名，事实上也是非汉语的汉词。
    现今江浙一带，还有不少县市名原是春秋战国时的越语的字音词。苏州、杭州的“州”字虽是汉语，
  “苏”与“杭”却是越语。此外如无锡、句容、于潜、余杭、余姚、上虞、诸暨，都是越语。这些越语地名的汉词在秦汉时早已有定字，其越语原义大抵亦已不为当地的汉人所知，所以王莽改郡县名，就把无锡改成有锡，可见他是把无锡按汉字字义解释的。刘秀复兴汉室，尽罢王莽所改县名，有锡又改无锡。有了王莽、刘秀这两改名，后人望文生义，便编撰出一段故事：周秦时产锡，地名本为锡山；汉兴锡殚，故置无锡县；王莽时锡复出，改县名为有锡；东汉锡又竭，乃复改为无锡。许多笔记方志都采用了这种说法，民间流播甚广。
    不仅南方有些地名被曲解，北方也有些源出于古胡语的地名。（8月10日《社会科学报》盛巽昌文）
