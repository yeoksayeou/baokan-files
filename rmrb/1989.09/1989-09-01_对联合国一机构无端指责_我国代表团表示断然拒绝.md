    China Rejects Unfounded Accusations by a UN Body
    China's Delegation Expresses Firm Rejection

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 31 - The Chinese delegation issued a statement today in Geneva, expressing deep regret over the decision made by the United Nations Human Rights Committee's Subcommittee on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities at its 41st session, which unjustly accused China of human rights violations. The Chinese delegation, in a written statement, sternly pointed out that the essence of this resolution is interference in China's internal affairs.

    The statement said that the subcommittee, despite China's firm opposition, passed this resolution, which deviates from the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and violates recognized international norms. The Chinese government firmly rejects this resolution, deeming it completely invalid and having no binding force on China.

    Prior to the voting on the aforementioned resolution, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, Ambassador Fan Guoxiang, addressed the subcommittee meeting regarding the draft resolution. He emphasized that the Chinese government has always valued human rights, and China's constitution and laws guarantee the extensive rights of all ethnic groups. However, the recent events in Beijing were a planned, organized, and premeditated counter-revolutionary riot aimed at overthrowing the government of the People's Republic of China and the socialist system stipulated by the constitution. The draft resolution confuses right and wrong, labeling the Chinese government's actions to maintain the constitution, national stability, and the interests of 1.1 billion people as human rights violations, which is utterly unreasonable.

    Fan Guoxiang stressed that the Chinese government, under extreme provocation, took measures to maintain law and order, protect the lives and property of the vast majority of people, which is completely legal, justified, and necessary. It is an internal affair of China, and no foreign country, international organization, or individual has the right to interfere.

    对联合国一机构无端指责
    我国代表团表示断然拒绝
    新华社日内瓦8月31日电  中国代表团今天在这里发表声明，对联合国人权委员会防止歧视和保护少数小组委员会第41届会议通过决议，无端指责中国侵犯人权一事，表示极大的遗憾。中国代表团在书面声明中严正指出，这一决议的实质是干涉中国内政。
    声明说，小组委员会无视中国的坚决反对通过的这一决议，背离了联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，违反了公认的国际关系准则。中国政府断然拒绝这一决议，认为它是完全无效的，对中国没有任何约束力。
    在上述决议付诸表决前，中国驻联合国日内瓦办事处常驻代表范国祥大使在小组委员会会议上就决议草案发言。他强调指出，中国政府一向重视人权，中国宪法和法律保障各族人民享有广泛的权利。但是，最近在北京发生的事件是一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的、以推翻中华人民共和国政府和宪法规定的社会主义制度为目的的反革命暴乱。该决议草案混淆是非，把中国政府为维护宪法、维护国家安定、维护11亿人民利益而不得不进行的平息暴乱说成是侵犯人权，这是毫无道理的。
    范国祥强调说，中国政府在忍无可忍的情况下采取措施，维护法律和秩序，保护广大人民群众的生命和财产，是完全合法的、正当的和必要的，是中国主权范围内的事，任何外国、国际组织或个人均无权干涉。
