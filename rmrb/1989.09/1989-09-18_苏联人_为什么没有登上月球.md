The Soviets
Why Did They Not Land on the Moon

In 1957, the Soviets, who first opened the door to outer space, did not land on the moon. A recent signed article in the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* has revealed the mystery behind this.

Long before the United States implemented the Apollo moon landing program, the Soviet Union's chief rocket designer, S. Korolev, was secretly planning a moon landing. Soon after, astronauts like Leonov began training for moon flights. Korolev proposed increasing the payload capacity of existing rockets by fifteen to twenty times, building a rocket with an effective payload of around one hundred tons, the N1. Due to the enormous investment required and the fact that it exceeded the need to maintain strategic parity with the United States, Soviet decision-makers hesitated for a long time. In 1960, the Soviet government approved a payload of only forty to fifty tons for the N1 rocket, and it was not until 1966 that a plan for a ninety-five-ton payload was passed.

In 1961, the United States announced the Apollo moon landing program, adding pressure to Soviet scientists. As Korolev had to accelerate the development of the N1 rocket, he lacked the critical component—the engine. At that time, the only research institute in the Soviet Union capable of designing such an engine was led by Glushko. Unfortunately, the two scientists had differing views on the development direction of rocket engines.

Glushko proposed using toxic chemicals like fluorine and nitric acid as fuel, replacing the then-used kerosene and liquid oxygen, while Korolev believed that hydrogen-oxygen mixed fuel was more reliable. Additionally, Korolev planned to use a large number of medium-sized engines working in sync as the first stage of the N1 rocket, while Glushko suggested using a large engine cluster. The academic dispute ultimately prevented the two scientific giants from collaborating. In desperation, Korolev turned to aircraft engine expert Kuznetsov for help.

In 1966, Korolev suddenly passed away. His successor, Academician Mishin, adhered to Korolev's design ideas, but time was tight, and Mishin had to skip some necessary engine ignition tests.

On February 21, 1969, July 3, 1970, and July 27, 1971, scientists conducted three launch tests of the N1 rocket with a payload of ninety-five tons, all of which failed. During the fourth test on November 23, 1972, the N1 rocket flew for one hundred and seven seconds. During this time, all engines and the first-stage systems of the rocket worked normally. Although this test ultimately failed due to a malfunction in the tail section, scientists were greatly encouraged. This precious one hundred and seven seconds showed that the rocket's overall design was correct and that success was not far off.

The scientists' optimism was justified. The N1 rocket's control system, measurement technology, and some internal structural features were the most advanced at the time, surpassing the Saturn V rocket used in the U.S. Apollo moon landing program. In particular, it first adopted lightweight, high-strength spherical fuel tanks and made bold improvements to some power supply devices, which are still relevant to today's aerospace technology.

However, in May 1974, just as scientists were actively preparing for the next two launch tests, Glushko replaced Mishin as the chief designer of the Korolev Design Bureau. On his first day in office, he announced that the N1 rocket design was a mistake and declared that he was "not coming empty-handed." Thus, the secret development of the giant N1 rocket quietly came to an end.

Under Glushko's leadership, the development of a new rocket began from scratch, achieving great success a decade later, giving birth to the Soviet Buran space shuttle and the Energia giant rocket. However, for the moon landing program that Korolev and his generation of scientists had struggled for over a decade, the most precious thing—time—was lost.

In the past decade, the focus of Soviet aerospace experts has been on perfecting the orbital space station and training astronauts to live in space for extended periods. Soviet astronauts have accumulated over fourteen years in space, three times that of American astronauts. Clearly, the Soviets have set their sights on Mars.

### 苏联人　为什么没有登上月球

　　苏联人
　　为什么没有登上月球
    一九五七年首次敲开外层空间大门的苏联人为什么没登上月球？苏联《消息报》最近的一篇署名文章揭开了这个谜。
    早在美国实施“阿波罗”登月计划以前，苏联头号宇航设计师C·柯罗列夫就在秘密地酝酿登月计划。不久，列昂诺夫等几名宇航员也开始接受登月飞行训练。柯罗列夫建议将现有火箭的载重量提高十五至二十倍，建造有效负载高达一百吨左右的HI号火箭。由于这需要巨额投资，且超过了当时保持苏美战略均势的需要，苏联决策人长时间犹豫不决。一九六○年，苏联政府批准的HI号火箭的有效负载只有四十至五十吨，直到一九六六年才通过了九十五吨有效负载的计划。
    一九六一年美国公布“阿波罗”登月计划，给苏联科学家增加了压力。在柯罗列夫必须加快HI号火箭的研究步伐时，他却缺少火箭的关键部分——发动机。当时能胜任该发动机设计的研究单位在苏联只有格鲁什科领导的设计局。遗憾的是两位科学家对火箭发动机发展方向的看法相左。
    格鲁什科建议用氟、硝酸等有毒化学物质作燃料，取代当时使用的煤油和液态氧，而柯罗列夫则认为使用氢氧混合燃料更加可靠。此外，柯罗列夫计划用大量同步工作的中型发动机充当HI号火箭的第一级，格鲁什科则建议联结大型发动机组。学术上的争执终于未能使这两位科学巨人携起手来。陷入困境的柯罗列夫不得已转向飞机发动机专家库兹涅佐夫寻求帮助。
    一九六六年，柯罗列夫突然不幸逝世。接替他的科学院院士米申坚持了他的设计思想，但时间紧迫，米申不得不省去一些必要的发动机点火试验。
    一九六九年二月二十一日、一九七○年七月三日和一九七一年七月二十七日，科学家们先后三次对有效负载九十五吨的HI号巨型火箭进行了发射试验，结果均遭失败。在一九七二年十一月二十三日进行的第四次试验中，HI号火箭飞行了一百零七秒。其间所有发动机和火箭第一级系统工作正常。尽管这次试射终因尾舱部件失灵而失败，但科学家们却极受鼓舞。这宝贵的一百零七秒表明，火箭的总体设计方案是正确的，离最后成功已经不远。
    科学家们的乐观是有根据的。HI号火箭的控制系统、测量技术以及一些内部结构特征在当时都是最先进的，超过了美国用于“阿波罗”登月计划的“土星”五号火箭。特别是它首次采用了重量轻、强度大的球形燃料舱，并对一些供电装置做了大胆的改进，即使对今天的航天技术也有许多借鉴之处。
    然而，一九七四年五月正当科学家们为下两次发射试验积极准备时，格鲁什科取代米申成为柯罗列夫设计局的总设计师。他上任的第一天就宣布HI号火箭的设计方案是一个错误，并声明自己“不是空着提包”来的。就这样，悄悄开始的HI号巨型火箭的研制工作又悄悄地结束了。
    新型火箭的研究在格鲁什科的领导下从头开始，十几年后获得巨大成功，孕育出苏联“暴风雨”号航天飞机和“能源”号巨型火箭。但是，对于柯罗列夫等一代科学家为之奋斗十多年的登月计划来说，却失去了最宝贵的东西——时间。
    最近十年中，苏联宇航专家的研究重点一直是完善地球轨道空间站，锻炼宇航员在太空长期生活的能力。苏联宇航员在太空逗留的时间已累计超过十四年，是美国宇航员的三倍。很显然，苏联人已经把目光投向火星。　　胡锡进编译
