Young coal miner Yang Pinghe from the Pingxiang Mining Bureau's Anshan Coal Mine's Mining and Excavation Area 1 in Jiangxi has dedicated himself to his work, enduring hardships and toiling tirelessly. In the ten years and four months he has been working in the mine, he has already mined 13.22 million tons of coal, completing the work of 21 years.

In Yang Pinghe's home, he told us about a recent statement he had heard: "Yang Pinghe is a victim of spiritual civilization, losing his own value realization." When we asked him what he thought, he shrugged and said, "My parents gave me these hands, and I must use them to do the work the country has given me. That is my value."

Only then did we notice that Yang Pinghe's palms and fingers were almost twice as thick as those of an ordinary person, with calluses layer upon layer, and black and green scars from coal dust embedded in his flesh, forming unique marks left by the "underground ironman."

Yang Pinghe has a treasure: a large water bottle that can hold 5 kilograms of water. Once he goes down into the mine, he works like a wound-up spring, never stopping. He sweats so much that the water in his old aluminum bottle is never enough, so he switched to this large plastic bottle. On Yang Pinghe's attendance record, it is almost all full attendance. Since he started working in the mine, he has spent 320 Sundays underground.

Before 1987, his family still lived 20 kilometers away from the mine in the countryside. Every quarter, he only returned home once or twice during the shift change, staying a few hours before rushing back to work. One spring, he returned home to deliver his salary, arriving at home at 5 PM. At 2 AM the next night, he got up to catch the early shift. His wife, Xiao Shumei, opened the door to see him off, and was immediately shocked by the scene outside: thunder mixed with lightning, and a storm with howling winds, as if the sky was about to collapse. She pulled her husband back and said, "You haven't rested in months, just take a day off!" Yang Pinghe said to his wife, "The working face has encountered a rotten roof, and I can't rest easy." His colleagues thought he wouldn't come, but just two minutes before the shift started, Yang Pinghe appeared in front of everyone, soaked to the skin.

Yang Pinghe has been awarded the title of "Youth Shock Worker" in the province and has received the "May Day Labor Medal" from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He has been named a model worker for the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, Pingxiang City, and the national coal industry. In 1988, he was elected as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. When he goes out for meetings and inspections, the time spent underground is reduced, so he squeezes his time even tighter. People have lost count of how many times he has left his luggage in the changing room, washed up after work, and rushed to the station. After attending the meeting, he didn't even go home but went straight back to the working face to mine coal.

Yang Pinghe has a saying: "Only using one's own two hands to work hard can be considered a good miner, but working together with everyone is what a Communist Party member should do." Last year, due to changes in geological conditions, Anshan Mine's original coal production target of 1.08 million tons was only 0.98 million tons by the end of November, and the annual plan might fail. At that time, power plants across the province were in urgent need of coal, and the provincial government repeatedly urged for adjustments. Learning of this situation, he couldn't sleep for several nights. He found another model worker, Wu Yianqiang, and said, "Let's initiate a labor competition." Wu Yianqiang said, "Alright, I'll follow you." On December 3, they invited more than 60 coal miners from the entire mine to the trade union meeting room. First, they introduced the grim situation of coal production, and then they talked about their determination to mine 200 poles each in December (equivalent to mining 1,400 tons of coal). At the meeting, there was first a moment of silence, followed by a series of loud voices: "I'll mine 150!" "I'll mine 160!" "I'll mine 180!" ... A competition proposal was also formed at the meeting. As a result, by the end of December, the entire mine had exceeded the annual plan by 481 tons. (Xinhua News Agency provided this report for the newspaper)

    “井下拚命三郎”
    ——记全国煤炭系统特等劳模杨和平
    黄其庄　梁明玉
    江西萍乡矿务局安源煤矿采掘一区青年采煤工杨和平，一心扑在工作上，吃苦耐劳，进矿十年零四个月，已经采了13.22万吨煤，完成了21年的工作量。
    在杨和平家里，他告诉我们前几天听到的一种说法：
  “杨和平是精神文明的牺牲品，丧失了自我价值的实现。”我们问他怎么看，他两手一摊，说：“父母给了我这双手，我就要用它干好祖国给我的那份事。这就是我的价值观。”
    这时我们才发现，杨和平的手掌和手指，几乎比一般人粗一半，老茧一层裹着一层，煤屑刺入肉里长合后形成的一条条青黑色斑痕，是给这位
  “井下拚命三郎”留下的特殊印记。
    杨和平有一件宝物：一个可装5公斤水的大水壶。他一下井就像上足了发条似的，不知停歇。出汗太多，用原来的铝壶装水总不够喝，就换了这个大塑料壶。在杨和平的考勤簿上，几乎都是全勤。他进矿以来，有320个星期天是在井下度过的。
    1987年以前，他家还在离矿20公里的乡下，每个季度只是利用换班的空隙回去一两次，在家停几个小时就赶回来上班。一年春天，他回家送工资，下午五点到家，下夜两点起床去赶早班。妻子肖树梅开门送他，顿时被门外的情景吓呆了：雷声夹着闪电，狂风卷着暴雨，天都似乎要倾塌下来。她一把拖住丈夫说：“几个月都没歇了，就补休一天吧！”小杨对妻子说：“工作面遇到了烂顶板，我放心不下。”同伴们断定他不能来了，可就在进班前两分钟，杨和平湿淋淋出现在大家面前。
    杨和平曾先后荣获省“青年突击手”称号和全国总工会颁发的“五一”劳动奖章，被评为萍乡矿务局、萍乡市劳模和全国煤炭系统特等劳模，1988年当选为全国政协委员。外出开会，考察要占去下井的时间，他就把时间抓得更紧了。人们不记得有多少次了：他把行李放在进班室，下班后洗完澡直奔车站，开完会连家门也未进，又一头扎到工作面采起煤来。
    杨和平有一句话：“光用自己一双手苦干的只能算一个好矿工，拉着大家的手共同干的才是一个共产党员。”去年，安源矿因地质条件变化等原因，108万吨原煤生产任务，到11月底只完成98万吨，全年计划可能落空。当时，全省电厂用煤告急，省里几次催调。得知这个情况，他几个晚上没睡好。他找到劳模吴彦强说：“我们倡导一次劳动竞赛吧。”吴彦强说：“行，我跟着你干。”12月3日，他俩把全矿60多名采煤手请到工会会议室，首先介绍了煤炭生产的严峻形势，然后讲了他俩当月各采200根杆子
  （即落煤1400吨）的决心。会上先是一阵沉默，接着是一连串响亮的声音：“我采150！”“我采160！”“我采180！”……一份竞赛的倡议书也在会上形成。结果，到12月底，全矿超额481吨完成了全年计划。（新华社供本报专稿）
