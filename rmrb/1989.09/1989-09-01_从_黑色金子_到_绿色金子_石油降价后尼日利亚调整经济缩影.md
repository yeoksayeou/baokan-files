Upon entering Nigeria's capital, Lagos, one is immediately struck by its grandeur. Three long, wide flyovers connect Victoria Island, Ikoyi Island, Lagos Island, and the mainland, resembling giant dragons. The shore is lined with modern high-rise buildings, while the harbor is filled with ships from various countries. Below the flyovers, the lagoon shimmers under the sunlight, and above, rows of cars race by. Lagos gives the impression of being both beautiful and prosperous.

However, one will notice that while there are many luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz on the roads, there are also many old, dilapidated vehicles. The hosts explain, "During the heyday of the oil economy, whether public or private vehicles, few people maintained them. When they wore out, they simply bought new ones. After the oil price drop, foreign exchange is scarce, so old and broken-down cars are becoming more common." These words might also reflect the economic situation of Nigeria after the oil price drop.

Once known as the "oil giant," Nigeria saw its oil export revenue increase year by year from the 1970s to the early 1980s. In 1980, oil earnings reached $25 billion. It was with this influx of oil dollars that Nigeria built over 200 large-scale enterprises. Road construction expanded from just over a thousand kilometers at independence to over 9,500 kilometers nationwide, many of which are enclosed high-speed roads. Additionally, there are modern ports and a relatively developed aviation industry. In 1979, Nigeria's GDP was over 80% of South Africa's, making it one of Africa's leading economic powers.

However, the oil economy brought not only prosperity but also drawbacks: Rural populations flocked to cities, leaving farms abandoned, turning Nigeria from a major exporter of grains, peanuts, palm oil, and cotton into a country that imports these and various consumer goods. "Black gold" strangled "green gold"! After the oil price drop, Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings plummeted, reaching only $5.6 billion in 1986. The deficit increased, industry stagnated, unemployment rose, prices soared, and food shortages became common, pushing the economy into a severe crisis.

The severe setback finally made Nigeria realize the fragility of its economy, which had relied solely on oil exports for prosperity. Only by reviving agriculture could Nigeria, a country of 100 million people, ensure its survival and development. When we arrived in Nigeria, it was at the time when the federal government, led by Babangida, was calling on the people to focus on agriculture and had achieved initial success.

"Taking bread from the earth" is an initiative of the people in the Jos Plateau region in northern Nigeria. After the federal government banned wheat imports in 1986 due to foreign exchange shortages, the people of Jos resolved to grow wheat on their own land. Nigeria had no history of wheat cultivation, and many domestic and foreign experts believed that Nigeria's climate was not suitable for wheat. However, some experts thought that the Jos region, being a highland, had a cool climate suitable for wheat cultivation. After scientific trials, wheat cultivation was indeed successful. The manager of the Jos Agricultural Development Project, Mr. Kor, excitedly told us that their wheat can be harvested twice a year. Now, many farms in the Jos region are cultivating wheat. Friends took us to visit the experimental fields; on the right, a wheat field with 150 kilograms per hectare, automated sprinkler irrigation, intended for large-scale production farms in the future; on the left, 120 kilograms per hectare, manual irrigation, intended for small farmers. Both wheat fields seemed to be growing well. Friends humbly and sincerely said: China has a long history of wheat cultivation with rich experience. We hope one day to go to China to learn and also hope that Chinese friends can come to Jos to invest and cooperate in wheat cultivation and provide technical guidance.

After Nigeria banned wheat imports, technicians used local corn and sorghum to replace imported wheat to make food, which was cheap and popular among consumers.

Industry should serve agricultural development, which is the direction proposed by Nigeria after adjusting its economic structure. The Nafcon Fertilizer Plant in Akwa Ibom State is a typical example of responding to this call. As soon as we arrived at the plant, we saw a large hand on the plant's sign, scattering countless fertilizers onto green plants. The implication is to produce more fertilizers for farmers. The general manager, George, is full of confidence in the development prospects of Nigeria's fertilizer industry. The Nafcon Fertilizer Plant is the first large-scale, advanced-equipment fertilizer plant in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, it produces 1,000 tons of ammonia fertilizer, 1,500 tons of urea, and 1,000 tons of NPK fertilizer daily. This plant is also expanding, and after completion, the production of urea and ammonia fertilizer will double.

After the oil price drop, Nigeria's leaders prioritized agricultural development as the foundation for economic growth, which is undoubtedly a far-sighted decision. After a few years of effort, initial benefits have been seen, bringing hope for economic recovery. Currently, Nigeria's biggest difficulty is a lack of funds, and many agricultural construction projects cannot be carried out for the time being. However, economic experts believe that as long as Nigeria adheres to the policy of prioritizing agricultural development and adjusting its economic structure, it will be beneficial for its economic recovery.

### 从“黑色金子”到“绿色金子”——石油降价后尼日利亚调整经济缩影

    从“黑色金子”到“绿色金子”
    ——石油降价后尼日利亚调整经济缩影
    本报记者　徐德文
    进入尼日利亚首都拉各斯，使人顿生气势非凡之感。三座又长又宽的高架桥像巨龙把维多利亚岛、伊库衣岛、拉各斯岛和大陆联结一起。岸上现代化高楼林立，对岸，来自各国的大小船舶停靠港区，桥下泻湖波光粼粼，桥上数排车流竞相飞驰……，拉各斯给人的第一个印象是既美丽又繁荣。
    然而，人们会看到，奔跑在公路上的汽车虽不乏奔驰牌高级轿车，但也有不少是其貌不扬、又旧又破的。对此，主人解释说：“尼日利亚在石油经济繁荣时期，无论公车或私车都很少有人维修，用旧了就买新的。石油降价后，外汇紧缺，所以旧车、破车越来越多了。”这几句话，是否可以说也是石油降价后，尼日利亚经济状况的缩影呢？！
    曾被称为“石油巨人”的尼日利亚，从70年代至80年代初，石油出口收入连年递增，1980年石油创汇多达250亿美元。正是用这滚滚而来的石油美元，尼日利亚建成200多项大型企业，公路建设也由独立前的千余公里，发展到如今纵横全国、总长9500多公里，其中不少还是封闭式的高速公路呢。此外还有现代化的港口和相当发达的航空事业。1979年，尼日利亚国民生产总值相当于南非的80％以上，成为非洲数一数二的经济大国。
    然而，石油经济既带来“繁荣”，也带来弊端：农村大批人口离乡弃田，涌入城市，致使曾是粮食、花生、棕榈油、棉花等大宗出口国的尼日利亚一变成为粮食等多种农产品和各种消费品均需进口的国家。“黑色金子”扼杀了“绿色金子”！石油降价以后，尼日利亚外汇收入锐减，1986年竟下降到56亿美元，赤字频增，工业萧条，失业增多，物价飞涨，粮食短缺……经济陷入严重困境。
    巨大的挫折，终于使尼日利亚举国上下清醒过来，认识到单纯依赖石油出口“繁荣”起来的经济基础是多么脆弱；只有恢复和振兴农业，才是拥有1亿人口的非洲大国尼日利亚赖以生存发展的基础。我们到达尼日利亚时，正是以巴班吉达为首的联邦政府号召人民大搞农业并取得初步成就的时候。
      “向大地要面包”，这是尼日利亚北部高原乔斯地区人民的创举。自联邦政府1986年因外汇紧缺禁止小麦进口后，乔斯人就立志要在自己的土地上种出小麦来。尼日利亚没有种小麦的纪录，而国内外不少专家断言，尼日利亚的气候不适宜种植小麦。但也有些专家认为，乔斯地区地处高原，气候凉爽，适宜小麦生长。经过科学试种后，果然获得成功。乔斯地区农业发展项目经理柯先生兴奋地告诉我们，他们的小麦一年两熟。现在乔斯地区不少农场种植小麦。朋友们陪我们到试验田参观，右边一块麦田每公顷播种150公斤，自动化喷灌，打算以后向大规模生产的农场推广；左边那块每公顷播种120公斤，靠人工灌溉，准备向小农推广。看来两块麦田的小麦长势都不错。朋友们既谦虚又诚恳地说：中国种植小麦历史悠久，经验丰富，希望有朝一日能去中国学习，也希望中国朋友能来乔斯投资合作种小麦，并进行技术指导。
    尼日利亚禁止小麦进口后，科技人员利用本国的玉米、高粱替代进口小麦制作食品，价廉物美，很受消费者欢迎。
    工业要为农业发展服务，这是尼日利亚调整经济结构后提出的一个发展方向，位于阿夸伊博姆州的纳夫康化肥厂是积极响应这一号召的典型。我们一到该厂就看到厂标上绘着一只大手，洒下无数化肥，落在绿色植物之上。寓意是要给农民生产更多的化肥。接待我们的总经理乔治先生对尼日利亚化肥工业的发展前景充满信心。纳夫康化肥厂是非洲撒哈拉以南地区第一个规模大、设备先进的化肥厂，目前每日生产氨肥1000吨，尿素1500吨，氮磷钾肥1000吨。这家工厂还在扩建，完工后，尿素、氨肥产量将可翻番。
    石油降价以后，尼日利亚领导人把优先发展农业作为经济发展的基础，这无疑是一个很有远见的决策。经过几年的努力，现已初见效益，给经济转机带来希望。目前尼日利亚最大的困难是资金欠缺，不少农业建设项目一时还搞不起来。但经济专家认为，只要尼日利亚坚持优先发展农业的方针，调整经济结构，终将有利于它的经济回升。（附图片）
