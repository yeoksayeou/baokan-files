The nation's attention was focused on the National Conference for the Awarding of Labor Models and Advanced Workers, which opened this morning in the Great Hall of the People. The conference honored 2,790 labor models and advanced workers from 51 systems or industries across the country.

Today, the Tiananmen Square was adorned with fluttering red flags and blooming flowers along the ten-mile-long street. Around 8 a.m., as the labor models arrived in their cars from all directions towards the Great Hall of the People, passersby on the side of the road stopped to pay their respects to these heroes of the republic.

Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, and other party and state leaders attended the conference.

Before the meeting, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen, along with other party and state leaders attending the opening ceremony, warmly met with the representatives at the Great Hall of the People. They congratulated the gathering of heroes and happily posed for a group photo with the representatives. Representatives from Tibet presented Deng Xiaoping and others with pure white khatas, which Deng Xiaoping and others happily accepted.

At 10 a.m., Nie Rongzhen, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, announced the start of the awarding conference. The military band played the stirring national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun read the decision of the State Council to award the national labor models and advanced workers. Tu Xueshin and 1,987 others were awarded the honorable title of National Labor Model, while Peng Shixiong and 803 others were awarded the honorable title of National Advanced Worker.

Amidst warm applause and joyful music, representatives of the national labor models and advanced workers ascended the stage one by one to receive medals and certificates from party and state leaders. The young pioneers of the capital presented a basket of flowers to the conference.

At the meeting, Premier Li Peng, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, delivered an important speech. He said that today, the Party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a grand conference in Beijing to award national labor models and advanced workers. This is to fully affirm the leading, backbone, and bridge roles of advanced model figures, to resolutely support the creative labor and selfless dedication of advanced model figures on all fronts, and to mobilize and call on the people of the entire nation to learn from these advanced model figures (full text to be published separately).

At 11 a.m., the awarding conference concluded with the stirring song of "The Internationale."
