A farmer entrepreneur has a typical farmer's name—Chen Tongyin. His hometown is in the rural area of Siyang, which is a famous anti-Japanese base. That place produces knives, guns, and "Revolutionary Memoirs," but it also produces poverty. The son of a farmer, his aspirations embrace the soil: he has always wanted to plant trees. In 1961, he entered the Northeast Forestry University with outstanding results. He went to the Northeast to plant trees, to withstand the cold, to endure drought, and more importantly, to make the forests of the north vibrant and majestic. 1961 was a year of hunger, and the entire family tightened their belts to support this "tree." Could a tree grow peacefully with just one ring? After one year, he returned home. A tree had grown only one ring.

He understands sweat, he understands seeds, and he understands how the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning of the Su North will respond magnificently. In 1979, the energy of Chinese farmers began to be released. Land, land, complain about you, blame you, but also love you and miss you, all because you are the common mother of mankind.

Chen Tongyin's future awakened on the land. He developed a "simple high-yield cotton cultivation method," creating a record of 275 jin of lint per mu. His "two-season tomato cultivation method" produced 8,000 jin per mu, extending the market period by four months. He implemented the "all-weather greenhouse fermentation method," extending the fermentation period by half a year. Chen Tongyin was elected as a People's Representative, became a provincial labor model, and went to Beijing to attend the National Science Popularization Conference.

The tide of the commodity economy swept across China. The era placed wisdom on the same starting line. In the famous wine town of Yanghe, Chen Tongyin chose wine. In 1982, he joined forces to establish a four-household joint-venture wine factory. After three years of hard work, he took a crucial step in his life.

His village, Xiyu, is five li away from Yanghe Town. There are no roads, no electricity, no sideline industries; it is a "blank village," a forgotten "land of death." He decided to take a risky move, defying military strategy, and set up the wine factory in the village. Otherwise, how could he establish a blood-and-flesh connection with his impoverished hometown? In 1987, he broke ground and started production in the same year, establishing the Yanghe Jiulong Wine Factory next to Xiyu Village. He is a tiger, and the factory is a dragon; the tiger roars and the dragon sings, creating a lively and auspicious atmosphere. The entire village was immersed in a fragrant atmosphere.

Drop by drop, Chen Tongyin's wine flowed into life...

The wine flowed into the school. The only primary school in the village had five classes, four of which were in dilapidated buildings. The buildings leaked wind, rain, and sunlight, and during thunderstorms, lightning almost struck the desks. He donated 3,000 yuan to renovate seven classrooms, and in the summer of 1988, he invested another 10,000 yuan to build ten more, making the primary school look brand new. When Chen Tongyin stood quietly outside the window, listening to the children recite "We belong to the 21st century," what was he thinking?

The wine flowed into the village roads. Xiyu has never had a main road. In 1983, the district committee secretary drove to Xiyu and almost couldn't return home because the car had no way to turn around. Chen Tongyin firmly invested 70,000 yuan, and in two months, he paved a 6.5-li gravel road with five bridges. Fifteen-ton trucks carrying large boilers could enter the village. Neighboring four villages also benefited from the improved transportation. In 1988, he invested another 200,000 yuan to pave a 5-li asphalt road directly to Yanghe Town. Thus, the seven villages along the road and the eight small factories at the doorstep could take public buses to Huaiyin, Xuzhou, and the provincial capital Nanjing.

The wine flowed into the impoverished households. Relief is a livelihood, not just charity. First, you have to help the villagers stand tall. He established a white wine packaging workshop for the village and a vegetable and foodstuff joint venture linked to the Yanghe Wine Factory. The two projects can earn 100,000 yuan a year. His wine factory employed 240 villagers, making 40% of the village's households part of the factory's roster. He took on the village's "three grains and five coins" (the total term for farmers' grain and money payments), the salaries of 15 village and group cadres, and the poverty alleviation tasks for eight severely impoverished households in the township and ten impoverished households in the village. Wings need to be strengthened, and arms need to be accumulated. The agricultural and forestry major understands "rest and recovery." He provided high-voltage poles and transformers, bringing electricity from his factory to every household in the village. He deeply understood that for farmers, a switch symbolizes the right to autonomy and light.

As a brewmaster, his wine, like a warm stream, flowed to Heilongjiang, Urumqi, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Wenzhou. On a map of China, his yellow flags fluttered everywhere. He has not forgotten to plant trees. He knows that the earth provides trees with milk, but in times of drought, a large tree can offer 3 cubic meters of "blood" to the earth! This spring, he solemnly planted a row of trees in front of the factory gate, water pines, combining the northern majesty with the southern beauty. One pit is empty, and a row of trees is missing one. Others may not understand, but he does: that tree should be himself. To live a life like a tree is enough—he said.

　　他总想种树
　　赵恺
    一位农民企业家，有一个典型的农民的名字——陈同银。家乡在泗阳农村，那是著名的抗日根据地。那里出刀，出枪，出《革命回忆录》，也出贫困。农民的儿子，志向拥抱着泥土：他从小想种树。1961年，他以出类拔萃的成绩考入东北林学院。种树而且去东北，为了抗寒，为了耐旱，更为了北国森林有声有色有气势。1961年是饥饿的年代，全家老小勒紧裤带供养一棵“树”，“树”能安心抽叶？读了一年，他回来了。一棵树只长了一个年轮。
    他懂得汗水，他懂得种子，他懂得对于风雨雷电苏北大地会作出何等壮烈的反响。1979年，中国农民的能量开始释放。土地啊土地，抱怨你责难你，又疼你恋你离不开你，不都因为你是人类共同的母亲？
    陈同银的未来苏醒在大地上。他摸索出“棉花简易高产栽培法”，创造亩产皮棉275斤的纪录。他的“西红柿两熟栽培法”，亩产8000斤，上市期延长四个月。他实行“全天候大棚制曲”，把制曲期延长了整整半年。陈同银被选为人民代表，当上了省劳模，还到北京出席了全国科普大会。
    商品经济潮流席卷中国大地。时代把智慧放在同一条起跑线上。在蜚声四海的酒乡洋河镇边，陈同银选择了酒。1982年，他入盟创办四户联营酒厂。惨淡经营，三易寒暑。之后，他举起属于自己的那一颗棋子，走出此生举足轻重的一步。
    他家所在的西俞村离洋河镇五华里。无公路，无水电，无工副业，一个“空白村”，被遗忘的“死亡之地”。他决定犯兵家之大忌铤而走险，把酒厂办到村里去。不然，怎么能和穷苦的家乡建立血肉与共的联系？1987年，当年破土，当年投产，他在西俞村旁办起了洋河九龙酒厂。他属虎，酒厂属龙，虎啸龙吟，图个生动热烈，吉祥如意。全村沉浸在浓郁芬芳的氛围里。
    一滴，一滴，一滴，陈同银的酒流向生活……
    酒流进学校。全村唯一的一所小学，五个班级四个是危房。漏风漏雨漏太阳，打雷时，闪电几乎刺到课桌上。他拿出3000元翻修七间教室，1988年暑假再投1万建十间，这样，小学堂焕然一新了。当陈同银悄悄站在窗外，听孩子们琅声念出“我们属于21世纪”的时候，他作何感想？
    酒流进村路。西俞自古无大道。1983年地委书记坐小车到西俞，竟然因为车无调头之路而险些回不了家。陈同银毅然投资7万，两个月铺成一条6华里半的石子路，路上还建起5座桥。15吨卡车拉着大锅炉可以进村了。邻近4个村庄也受了交通之益。1988年再投20万，铺5华里柏油路直通洋河镇。这样，沿路7个村，8家小工厂在家门口就可以坐上公共汽车去淮阴，去徐州，去省城南京了。
    酒流进贫困户。扶贫是生计，不仅是赈济。首先得扶着乡亲挺直脊梁站起来。他为村子办了一个白酒包装车间，一个和洋河酒厂挂钩的蔬菜副食联合体，两个项目年利可达10万。他的酒厂招收了240名村民做工，使全村40％的农户进了工厂花名册。他承担了全村的“三粮五钱”（农民缴纳钱粮总称）、15位村、组干部的工资和全乡8个特困户、全村10个困难户的脱贫任务。羽翼有待丰满，臂力尚需积蓄，农林专业的大学生懂得“休养生息”。他出高压杆，出变压器，把自己工厂的电引进全村每一个农户。他深深理解，对于农民，一柄闸刀开关象征光明的自主权。
    作为酿造者，他的酒像温暖的溪水，流到了黑龙江，流到了乌鲁木齐，流到了绍兴、宁波和温州。一幅中国大地图上，星罗棋布的摇曳着他的杏黄旗。他没有忘记种树。他知道大地供树以乳汁，而在干旱时，一棵大树竟然能向大地奉献3个立方米的“血浆”！今春，他在厂门前庄重虔敬地种下一排树，水杉，取北国之挺拔兼南国之秀美。空着一穴，一排树独缺一棵。别人不懂，他懂：那棵树该是他自己。人生一世能像一棵树，足矣——他说。
