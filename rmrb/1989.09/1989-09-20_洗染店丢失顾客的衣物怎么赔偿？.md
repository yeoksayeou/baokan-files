	Editor,

	In early June, I sent a pure wool suit to a laundry shop for dry cleaning. This suit was made last October and had never been washed. Because I wore it carefully, it can be considered brand new. When I went to pick up the clothes on time, the staff said the pants were lost. I demanded compensation at the original price or to have a new pair made, but they refused. The staff said that according to the regulations, lost customer clothing is compensated at around 80%.

	I believe the shop's actions infringed upon my property rights. I plan to sue in court, but I am unsure if the court will accept the case.

	Doctor Hong Zhen:

	When you sent your clothes to the laundry shop, the shop, upon receiving payment and the clothes, should consider the contract established. The shop should be responsible for cleaning and properly storing the clothes. Now that the shop has lost your clothes, they should bear the civil liability for breaching the contract according to the law.

	Article 111 of the General Principles of Civil Law states: "If one party fails to perform a contract or performs it in a manner that does not meet the agreed conditions, the other party has the right to demand performance or take remedial measures, and also has the right to demand compensation for damages." Therefore, you have the right to demand compensation for damages from the shop. If both parties cannot reach an agreement, you can file a lawsuit with the basic people's court in the area where the shop is located, and the people's court should accept it.

	Regarding the amount of compensation, it should be handled according to the principles stipulated in Article 112 of the General Principles of Civil Law. The first paragraph of Article 112 states: "The party responsible for breaching the contract should compensate the other party for the losses incurred." This is the general principle of contract compensation. That is to say, the actual loss of your clothes, after accounting for depreciation, should be borne by the shop. The second paragraph of Article 112 states: "The parties can agree in the contract that if one party breaches the contract, they should pay a certain amount of liquidated damages to the other party; they can also agree in the contract on the method of calculating the amount of compensation for damages caused by breaching the contract." This is the principle of agreed compensation for breaching the contract. If the shop orally or in writing on the receipt informs you that lost clothes are compensated at around 80%, after you hand over the clothes to the shop, it should be considered that you have acknowledged this agreement. In the event of a dispute, it should be handled according to the agreement. If the shop's regulation is kept secret from customers and is only used as an internal reference, it cannot be used as an agreement between the two parties. In the event of a dispute, it should still be handled according to the general compensation principle.

	I hope you and the shop can be understanding and accommodating to each other and resolve this dispute properly.

### 洗染店丢失顾客的衣物怎么赔偿？

　　洗染店丢失顾客的衣物怎么赔偿？编辑同志：
    6月初，我将一套纯毛西装送一洗染店干洗。这套西装是我去年10月做的，没有洗过，因穿着谨慎，可说是全新的。当我按时去取衣时，服务员说裤子丢了。我要求照价赔偿，或照样缝制一条，被他们拒绝。服务员说，根据规定，丢失顾客衣服一律只赔偿80％左右。
    我认为店方的做法侵犯了我的财产权。我准备向法院起诉，但不知法院是否受理？
        北京同仁医院医师　洪　真洪真同志：
    你将衣服送到洗染店，店方收钱接衣后即应视为双方合同成立，店方应负责洗净并妥善保管。现店方将你的衣服丢失，应依法承担违反合同的民事责任。
    民法通则第111条规定：“当事人一方不履行合同义务或者履行合同义务不符合约定条件的，另一方有权要求履行或者采取补救措施，并有权要求赔偿损失。”因此，你有权向店方提出赔偿损失的要求。如果双方达不成协议，你可以向店方所在地基层人民法院提起诉讼，人民法院应予受理。
    关于赔偿数额问题，应该根据民法通则第112条规定的原则处理。112条第一款规定：“当事人一方违反合同的赔偿责任，应当相当于另一方因此所受到的损失。”这是合同的一般赔偿原则。这就是说，你的衣服除去折旧后的实际损失应由店方负责。112条第二款规定：“当事人可以在合同中约定，一方违反合同时，向另一方支付一定数额的违约金；也可以在合同中约定对于违反合同而产生的损失赔偿额的计算方法。”这是违反合同的约定赔偿原则。如果店方以口头或在取衣单等处书面告知你丢失衣服只赔偿80％左右，在你将衣服交与店方后即应视为承认了这一约定，发生纠纷后，应按约定处理。如果店方的这一规定对顾客保密，只作为内部参考依据，则不能作为双方同意的约定，发生纠纷后，仍应按一般赔偿原则处理。
    希望你与店方互谅互让，妥善解决这一纠纷。
