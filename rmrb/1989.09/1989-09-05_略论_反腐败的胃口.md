    A Brief Discussion on the "Appetite for Anti-Corruption"
    LÍ Guāng

    What is meant by the "appetite for anti-corruption"? In modern terms, it refers to the expectations for anti-corruption efforts; in simpler terms, it means the hope that anti-corruption will catch big "tigers."

    As the Party Central Committee's anti-corruption campaign rapidly unfolds, this issue of the "appetite for anti-corruption" has indeed become increasingly prominent. In the eyes of some comrades, catching officials at the section level who embezzle or accept bribes worth tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan is no longer impressive, and even catching officials at the bureau level is not that significant. The best scenario would be to catch several officials at the provincial or ministerial level and above, which would truly demonstrate a "resolute" and "thorough" anti-corruption stance. Otherwise, it would be difficult to say that anti-corruption efforts have been genuinely serious. This escalating "appetite" needs to be adjusted.

    Indeed, our anti-corruption efforts must be resolute, follow the law, and uphold the principle of equality before the law. We must not use the excuse of "corruption being inevitable" to tolerate and encourage wrongdoing, nor should we adopt the approach of "the law does not apply to high officials." However, we must have a correct assessment of corruption within the Party and government, which is as follows: First, the Party and government are generally good, and the vast majority of Party members and officials, including high-ranking officials and their children, are good or relatively good. Second, there are indeed instances of corruption within the Party and government, and some cases are quite serious, which must be resolutely punished. These two points are in line with reality. If we do not adhere to this two-point perspective but instead reverse it, believing that corruption is the mainstream of the Party and government, and that the more corrupt officials exposed, the better, and the bigger the better, then that is wrong. Such a perspective will inevitably lead to pessimistic conclusions. In recent times, some people have been influenced by the propaganda of those who instigated the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion under the guise of "anti-corruption," which is related to this mindset.

    In recognizing any matter, one must be realistic and start from reality. Anti-corruption is no exception. We must overcome the tendency of having no "appetite" for anti-corruption—that is, not being interested in it—and also prevent the "appetite" from being too high or too big.

    略论“反腐败的胃口”
    黎光
    什么叫“反腐败的胃口”？用句时髦的话说，就是对反腐败的期望值；用句通俗的话说，就是希望反腐败能抓出多大的大“老虎”。
    随着党中央领导的反腐败斗争的迅速展开，这个“反腐败的胃口”问题确实变得愈益突出了。在有些同志看来，抓出贪污、受贿几万元、几十万元的处级干部已经不算什么了，司局级干部也没啥了不起，最好是抓出若干省、部级以上的干部来，那才叫反腐败“坚决”、“彻底”，否则，反腐败就不能说“动了真格的”。对于这种越来越高的“胃口”很需要做一番调整。
    不错，我们反腐败必须态度坚决，依法办事，坚持在法律面前人人平等，绝不能以什么“腐败难免”为借口，姑息养奸，也不能搞“刑不上大夫”那一套。但是，对党和政府内的腐败现象必须有一个正确的估计，这就是：第一，我们党和政府从总体上说是好的，广大党员、干部，包括高级干部的子女，大多数也是好的、比较好的。第二，党内、政府内确有腐败现象，有些人的问题还很严重，必须坚决惩治。这样两点估计是符合实际的。如果不是坚持这样的两点论，而是颠倒过来，认为腐败是党和政府的主流，似乎揭出的贪官污吏越多越好、越大越好，那就错了。这样看问题，就必然会得出悲观的结论。前一段有些人之所以会接受动乱、反革命暴乱策划者借“反腐败”进行的蛊惑宣传，是与这种心态有关系的。
    认识任何事物，都应当实事求是，从实际出发。反腐败也不例外。我们既要克服对反腐败没有“胃口”——不感兴趣的错误倾向，也应当防止把“胃口”吊得过高、过大。
