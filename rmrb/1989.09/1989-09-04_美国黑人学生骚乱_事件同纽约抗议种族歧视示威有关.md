Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 3rd.

Thousands of black college students vacationing in Virginia Beach engaged in riots this morning, looting over 100 shops and injuring at least four people. The students involved are part of the 25,000 predominantly black students from universities along the East Coast who are in Virginia Beach for the annual Labor Day celebration.

There is currently no clear explanation for the cause of the riots, but the violent incident is related to a series of recent anti-racism protests in New York. The protests in New York were in response to the killing of a black teenager by a group of white youths 11 days ago.

The riots in Virginia Beach began around 2 a.m. and lasted for approximately five hours. Police reported that sporadic gunshots could be heard throughout the night, and several fires broke out.

    美国黑人学生骚乱
    事件同纽约抗议种族歧视示威有关
    新华社华盛顿9月3日电  据此间美国报纸报道，在弗吉尼亚城度假的数千名黑人大学生今晨发生骚乱，100多家商店被洗劫一空，至少有4人受伤。
    来自美国东海岸以黑人为主的大学的25000多名学生正在弗吉尼亚城欢度一年一度的劳工节。参加骚乱的这些学生是他们中的一部分。
    目前还没有有关骚乱原因的解释，但是这次暴力事件同纽约最近发生的一系列抗议种族歧视的示威有关。纽约黑人举行示威是抗议11天前一群白人少年杀害了一名黑人少年。
    弗吉尼亚城的这次骚乱是从清晨2点开始的，持续了约5个小时。警方报告说，该城彻夜可以听到零星的枪声，还发生了几起火灾。
