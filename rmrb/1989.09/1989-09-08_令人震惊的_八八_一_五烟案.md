Investigation Report

Based on information provided by reader Yu Fang, reporters from the People's Daily, along with officials from the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and the Hunan Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, conducted an investigation in Hengyang City. The results revealed that the "88·1·5 Tobacco Case" was a major case of collusion and speculation.

Internal and External Collusion, Disregarding Monopoly Regulations

In the spring of 1987, Li Hongbin, a business representative from Guangdong's Huakang County Yuehai Joint Venture Trade Company, after much effort, reached a verbal agreement with Yunnan's Yuxi Cigarette Factory to exchange steel for cigarettes. Due to restrictions imposed by the tobacco monopoly regulations, the Yuxi Cigarette Factory dared not send the cigarettes directly to Huakang. Instead, they instructed Li Hongbin to find a tobacco company to act as an intermediary. Li Hongbin approached Chen Liusheng and Huang Jianmin in Guilin. In July 1987, Chen Liusheng, through his brother who worked as a section chief in the Qiyang County Commerce Bureau, found a deputy director of the Qiyang County Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. In September, this deputy director helped Chen Liusheng establish contact with the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. On October 22, Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau Deputy Director Pei Xiren (now the director) and Sales Department Head Zhou Zhenglu, while passing through Qiyang, negotiated with Chen Liusheng and reached an agreement: after providing the intermediary service, Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau would receive 8% of the cigarette quota and 4.5% of the price difference. On October 27, representatives from Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau signed an agreement with the Yuxi Tobacco Branch Company to exchange steel for cigarettes. The required 200 tons of steel had already been procured by Li Hongbin in Kunming.

From November 1987 to January 1988, the Yuxi Cigarette Factory sent three batches of top-grade cigarettes totaling 4,013 cases, valued at over 1.52 million yuan, to Hengyang.

After the cigarettes arrived, the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, bound by the monopoly regulations, convened a party committee meeting to discuss the matter and required Chen Liusheng to find a third-level tobacco company to act as an agent. Through Chen Liusheng's efforts, the Guangxi Lipo County Tobacco Company immediately dispatched Business Department Head He Zhaolan, who, along with Huang Jianmin and Chen Liusheng, went to Hengyang to handle the delivery procedures. The Hengyang side provided all necessary documents, such as transit permits and introduction letters, allowing Huang Jianmin and others to quickly transfer the cigarettes to Guangdong. Li Hongbin, Chen Liusheng, and Huang Jianmin profited over 500,000 yuan from this transaction.

On January 4, 1988, Huang Jianmin, He Zhaolan, and two others, carrying documents from the Lipo County Tobacco Company, went to Hengyang again. This time, they took 150 boxes of cigarettes from the warehouse. On January 5, Huang, He, and others sold 70 of these boxes at a price three times higher than the regulated price in Hengyang, and were caught in the act by the Chengnan Public Security Sub-bureau. This case is known as the "88·1·5 Tobacco Case." After the investigation, the Chengnan Public Security Sub-bureau interrogated 8 people and froze all the cigarettes stored in the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau.

Money in Hand, Mocking the Law

The "88·1·5 Tobacco Case" has attracted significant attention. However, by February 9, 1988, all 8 people interrogated by the public security authorities were released. Several puzzling incidents followed:

After the case was exposed, the Chengnan Public Security Sub-bureau initially took an active stance and proposed four handling measures: first, arrest Li Hongbin and Chen Liusheng and punish them according to the law; second, confiscate all 2,546 cases of cigarettes worth over 1.1 million yuan and remit the funds to the state treasury; third, legally recover the illegal profits made by Guangdong's Yuehai Joint Venture Trade Company; fourth, confiscate the price difference of 15,112 yuan received by the Hengyang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and remit the funds to the state treasury. However, these measures were not implemented.

The problem lay with the confiscated tobacco funds totaling over 1.1 million yuan. Of this amount, 680,000 yuan was misappropriated. The Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau received 110,000 yuan, and the Hengyang Tobacco Branch Company (which has two names but one management team) also received 110,000 yuan. The Chengnan Public Security Sub-bureau received 460,000 yuan. Additionally, from the confiscated cigarettes, the Chengnan Public Security Sub-bureau illegally took 50 cases, totaling 2,500 cartons, with each officer receiving 2 cartons, the 20 officers of the Criminal Investigation Squad each receiving an additional 5 cartons, and 14 deputy section-level and above officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau each receiving 2 cartons. According to regulations, it is not permitted to use confiscated funds or items during the investigation process.

Since the case was exposed on January 5, 1988, no arrests or prosecutions have been made. Moreover, the primary suspect, Huang Jianmin, was released after posting a bail of 95,000 yuan, and the other suspects were also released after posting bails ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The main responsible persons and directly involved personnel from the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, who participated in the speculation, were not only not investigated but were also allowed to participate in the case investigation and share the confiscated funds.

The Case Under Investigation, Promotions and Advancements

After the case was exposed, the Hunan Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau sent investigators six times, and the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau sent investigators four times, but no results were achieved. Moreover, during the investigation period, the primary responsible person, Pei Xiren, was promoted from deputy director to director, and Zhou Zhenglu was promoted from sales department head to deputy director in charge of business operations.

Currently, people are very concerned about the "88·1·5 Tobacco Case" and hope that the higher authorities will take decisive action.

    令人震惊的“八八·一·五烟案”
    本报记者  龚金星
    根据读者余芳提供的线索，记者随国家烟草专卖局、湖南省烟草专卖局的同志到衡阳市调查，结果发现“88·1·5烟案”是一起内外勾结的投机倒把大案。
    内外谋划　无视专卖
    1987年春，广东海康县粤海联营贸易公司业务员李宏斌几经活动，与云南玉溪卷烟厂达成了用钢材串换香烟的口头协议，由于受烟草专卖条例的限制，玉溪卷烟厂不敢将烟直接发往海康，便让李宏斌找一家烟草公司中转。李宏斌找到桂林的陈六生、黄健民。1987年7月，陈六生通过在湖南祁阳县工商局当股长的哥哥牵线，找到祁阳县烟草专卖局一副局长。9月，这位副局长帮助陈六生与衡阳市烟草专卖局搭上了线。10月22日，衡阳市烟草专卖局副局长裴夕仁（现为局长）和销售科科长周正禄路过祁阳时，同陈六生谈判，达成协议：提供中转后，衡阳市烟草专卖局得香烟留成指标8％，差价款4.5％。10月27日，衡阳市烟草专卖局的代表与玉溪烟草分公司签订了一个以钢材串换卷烟的协议。所需200吨钢材，早由李宏斌在昆明套购到手。
    1987年11月至1988年1月，玉溪卷烟厂先后3次发给衡阳甲级卷烟4013件，价值152万多元。
    烟运到后，衡阳市烟草专卖局慑于专卖条例，专门开了党组会研究，要求陈六生找一家三级烟草公司代理。经陈六生活动，广西荔浦县烟草公司立即派出业务股长何昭鸾，伙同黄健民、陈六生到衡阳办理提货手续。衡阳方面提供了准运证、中转介绍信等一切方便，使得黄健民等迅速将烟转到广东，李宏斌、陈六生、黄健民从中获利50多万元。
    1988年1月4日，黄健民、何昭鸾等4人，持荔浦县烟草公司的函件再次到衡阳。这次，他们从仓库里提出了150箱烟。1月5日，黄、何等人将其中70箱以高出衡阳市规定价格的3倍就地倒卖，成交时，被衡阳市城南公安分局查获。此案被称为“88·1·5烟案”。经过侦查，城南公安分局对8人进行审查，并将库存在衡阳市烟草专卖局的所有香烟全部冻结。
    钱财到手　戏弄法纪
    “88·1·5烟案”令人关注。可是，到了1988年2月9日，公安机关审查的8人全部被解除了。一些令人费解的事也随之出现了：
    案件被侦破后，起初城南公安分局的态度很积极，还提出了4条处理意见：一、将李宏斌、陈六生二犯缉拿归案，依法惩办；二、对现存放在库的2546件卷烟，折款110多万元，全部没收，上缴国库；三、依法追缴广东粤海联营贸易公司非法从中牟取的暴利；四、对衡阳烟草专卖局从中收得的差价款15112元，予以没收，上缴国库。后来，这些处理意见并没有落实。
    问题就出在收缴的110多万元烟款上。这笔烟款中的68万元被动用。其中，衡阳市烟草专卖局分得11万元，两块牌子一套人马的衡阳烟草分公司分得了11万元；城南公安分局也得了46万元。此外，从没收的卷烟中，城南公安分局擅自拿了50件，共2500条，分局干警每人分得2条，刑侦队20名干警每人再多分5条，送给市公安局14名副处级以上干部每人2条。按规定，在案件尚未审结过程中，是不允许动用没收的赃款赃物的。
    这起烟案从去年1月5日发案到如今，未报捕、移送起诉一人，而且对当时已抓获的首犯之一黄健民，当他交纳了9.5万元保释金后便予以释放了，其他案犯在分别交纳1万元至1.5万元保释金后，也全部予以释放。对衡阳市烟草专卖局参与投机倒把的主要负责人和直接责任人员不但不查处，还让他们参与案件的调查，共享罚没款。
    案件在查　提拔升官
    案发后，湖南省烟草专卖局先后6次、国家烟草专卖局先后4次派人调查处理，都没有结果。而且在案件查处期间，主要责任者裴夕仁由副局长被提升为正局长，周正禄由销售科长被提升为主管业务的副局长。
    如今，人们对“88·1·5烟案”很关心，希望上面尽快动真格的。
