The ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement is scheduled to conclude on September 7 at the Sava Center in Belgrade. During the conference, leaders from various countries exchanged views and expressed their opinions on the new global situation, the tasks of the Non-Aligned Movement, and pressing international issues. After intense and lively discussions, they provided clear answers to the major issues at hand.

The leaders of the Non-Aligned countries adopted a realistic attitude towards the changing world situation. They believe that the current global political climate has improved, and the process of finding solutions to regional and global issues has begun. Confrontations between blocs have decreased, and the prospects for disarmament have shown positive changes. However, they also pointed out that the two major military and political blocs and the main participants in the Cold War still exist. The world is still threatened by a large number of nuclear arsenals, and hotspots of crisis and racism have not been eliminated. Additionally, there are issues of inequality, poverty, hunger, disease, drug abuse, various forms of terrorism, and environmental degradation. Therefore, the world is currently at a crossroads, and people of all countries must make choices.

After reaching a relatively consistent understanding of the current situation, this summit carefully studied and adjusted the priorities for future actions. Chairman Draganovshek reaffirmed that the strategic direction of the Non-Aligned Movement will not change. Efforts for peace, disarmament, and peaceful resolution of disputes, developing positive factors in the international situation, and striving to establish a more lasting peace and security remain the primary tasks of the Non-Aligned Movement. More than half of the documents adopted at this conference are about economic issues, and almost all the speeches at the conference mentioned the deteriorating economic situation and heavy debt burdens of developing countries. They pointed out that international détente has not extended to South-North economic relations, and major scientific and technological inventions and economic achievements have not reached developing countries. Instead, the crisis in South-North economic relations and the gap between the rich and the poor are widening. This economic situation has caused social unrest in many developing countries, seriously threatening their political stability and posing a significant danger to the international situation. Therefore, this summit prioritized solving the economic problems faced by developing countries and establishing a new international economic order.

For the first time in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement, this summit included protecting the human environment as one of its key focuses. They called on the international community to take emergency measures, formulate global conventions, and allocate special funds to address this issue. Observers here believe that the Non-Aligned Movement has made peace and development its main tasks.

To improve the efficiency of the Non-Aligned Movement and enhance its working methods, the leaders emphasized that the movement should no longer merely hold meetings and issue declarations. Instead, it should transition from issuing general political and moral appeals to taking concrete political actions and actively participating in solving various international issues.

The Non-Aligned Movement held its summit in Belgrade once again, and Yugoslavia took on the role of executive chair for another three years. This is not only because Belgrade is the birthplace of the Non-Aligned Movement but also a recognition of Yugoslavia's historical contributions to the movement over the past nearly 30 years. It is believed that, relying on everyone, it can push the Non-Aligned Movement to a new stage of development in this era of change.

    接受时代的挑战
    ——写在第九次不结盟国家首脑会议闭幕前
    本报记者　严正
    第9次不结盟国家首脑会议定于9月7日在贝尔格莱德的萨瓦中心闭幕。会议期间，各国领导人就新的世界形势、不结盟运动的任务以及当前紧迫的国际问题各抒己见，交换看法。经过紧张热烈的讨论，对当前的重大课题作出了明确的回答。
    不结盟国家领导人以现实主义态度正视世界形势的变化。他们认为，目前世界的政治气候有了改善，寻求地区和全球性问题解决办法的进程业已开始，集团对抗已经减少，裁军的前景出现了良好的变化。但是，他们也指出，两大军事政治集团和冷战的主要参与者还存在，现在世界仍然受到大批核武库的威胁，危机热点、种族主义仍然没有消除。此外，还存在不平等、贫困、饥饿、疾病、吸毒、各种形式的恐怖主义和环境恶化等问题。因此，当今世界正处于十字路口，各国人民必须作出抉择。
    这次首脑会议在对当前局势取得较为一致的认识后，认真研究和调整了今后行动的优先顺序。会议主席德拉诺夫舍克重申，不结盟运动的战略方向不会改变。为和平、裁军以及和平解决争端而努力，发展国际局势中的积极因素，争取建立较为持久的和平与安全，仍是不结盟运动的首要任务。这次会议通过的文件，有一半以上的内容是经济问题，几乎所有的大会发言都提到发展中国家急剧恶化的经济形势和沉重的外债负担。他们指出，国际上的缓和并未进入南北经济关系，世界上重大的科技发明和经济成果也没有传到发展中国家，相反，南北经济关系的危机和贫富悬殊还在扩大。这种经济状况已使许多发展中国家发生社会动乱，严重威胁其政治稳定，也使国际局势潜伏着巨大的危险。为此这次首脑会议把解决发展中国家面临的经济问题，建立新的国际经济秩序列为头等重要问题。南斯拉夫等国家的领导人都要求南北之间就现代经济问题立即进行全面的对话；不结盟运动中唯一的债权国科威特建议召开国际债务会议，取消外债利息，免除最贫困国家的债务。
    这次首脑会议还在不结盟运动史上第一次把保护人类环境列为运动的重点之一。他们呼吁国际社会采取紧急措施，制定世界性公约，并拨出专款来解决这个问题。此间观察家认为，不结盟运动已把和平与发展作为自己的主要任务。
    为了提高不结盟运动的效率，改善工作方法，首脑们强调今后不结盟运动不能再停留在开会、发宣言上，应从一般性地发出政治道义呼声转向采取实际的政治行动，积极参与解决各种国际问题。
    不结盟运动再次在贝尔格莱德举行首脑会议，南斯拉夫第二次担任为期3年的执行主席，这不仅因为贝尔格莱德是不结盟运动的发祥地，而且也是对南斯拉夫近30年来为不结盟运动所作的历史性贡献的肯定。相信它能在这充满变革的时代依靠大家把不结盟运动推向新的发展阶段。
