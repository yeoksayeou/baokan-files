The first China Film Festival, which lasted seven days, came to a close today amidst military music.

On the eve of the festival's closure, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, and Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, warmly received all the representatives attending the film festival. Jiang Zemin commended the film workers for their hard work and achievements in promoting socialist cultural development.

Today's closing ceremony featured the screening of a documentary film titled "Unforgettable Days," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio based on precious historical materials. The film captured rare moments of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries and cultural workers together, with many of these materials being shown to the public for the first time. When scenes of Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi dancing with cultural workers in Zhongshan Park and Zhou Enlai singing with military cultural workers appeared on the screen, the film workers in the closing ceremony hall applauded enthusiastically. Chen Haosu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television and Chairman of the Organizing Committee of this film festival, delivered a speech. He said that the precious scenes shown in this film provide valuable inspiration for today's citizens and artists of the Republic: only when the highest leaders of the Party and the state, as well as every citizen, show enthusiasm for cultural and artistic endeavors, and artists fulfill their duties, can the arts have a brilliant future.

This film festival screened 40 films of various styles. Film artists visited factories, rural areas, military units, and research institutions to listen to the opinions of the general audience about films. The festival also organized the "40 Years of Chinese Cinema Discussion Forum." Chen Haosu pointed out that we advocate for all excellent works that are beneficial to modernization construction and reform, and all excellent works that are beneficial to cultivating people's moral character. On this basis, we encourage the comprehensive prosperity of the film industry.

The second China Film Festival will be held in 1991. At that time, an international film trade market will be opened simultaneously.

    江泽民李瑞环接见全体代表
    本报北京9月27日讯　记者李力报道：历时七天的第一届中国电影节今天在军乐声中降下帷幕。
    电影节闭幕前夕，中共中央总书记江泽民、中央政治局常委李瑞环等同志亲切接见了出席电影节的全体代表。江泽民同志对电影工作者为繁荣社会主义文化事业所作的辛勤努力和取得的丰硕成果给予了肯定性的评价。
    今天的闭幕式上放映了中央新闻纪录电影制片厂根据珍贵的历史资料编辑而成的纪录影片《难忘的日子》。影片记录了毛泽东等老一辈无产阶级革命家和文艺工作者在一起的难得的镜头，很多资料是首次公开。当影片出现毛泽东、刘少奇等领导人在中山公园和文艺工作者翩然起舞、周恩来总理和部队文艺工作者一起唱歌等场面时，闭幕式会场内的电影工作者报以热烈的掌声。广播电影电视部副部长、本届电影节组委会主任陈昊苏致辞说，这部影片展现的珍贵的镜头给今天共和国的公民和艺术家们以宝贵的启示：只有从党和国家的最高领导人到每一个公民都对文化艺术事业表现出热情，而艺术家们尽职尽责，艺术事业才能有辉煌的前程。
    这次电影节上放映了40部不同风格的影片，电影艺术家们奔赴工厂、农村、部队、科研机关，听取广大观众对电影的意见。电影节还主办了“中国电影40年讨论会”。陈昊苏指出，我们提倡一切有利于现代化建设和改革事业的优秀之作，提倡一切有利于陶冶人们道德情操的优秀之作，在这个前提下鼓励电影事业的全面繁荣。
    第二届中国电影节将于1991年举行。届时将同时开办国际性电影交易市场。
