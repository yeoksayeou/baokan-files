Jo Chi and Krenz Hold Talks
Both Sides Reach Consensus on Strengthening Relations Between the Two Parties and Countries

	Beijing, September 25 (Reported by He Chongyuan) — Jo Chi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said today in talks with a delegation from the German Democratic Republic that China's political situation is stable and that the current focus is on strengthening party building.

	Jo Chi made these remarks during a meeting at the Great Hall of the People with Egon Krenz, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Vice Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic.

	Jo Chi briefed the German guests on the current domestic situation. He said that efforts must be made to strengthen ideological and political work, to educate people on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization; to fully leverage the party's fine traditions of maintaining close ties with the masses and persevering through hardships, to seriously address corruption among a small number of party cadres, to improve the construction of leading cadres at all levels, and to enhance the quality of party members; and to strengthen the principle of democratic centralism.

	Regarding international issues, Jo Chi said that while East-West relations are easing, some hostile forces in the West are attempting peaceful evolution against socialist countries. We must remain vigilant against this.

	Jo Chi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, warmly welcomed the delegation from the German Democratic Republic to China. He also happily recalled his visit to the German Democratic Republic last year. He expressed satisfaction and joy at the development of relations between the two parties and countries. Jo Chi pointed out: "I believe that through the joint efforts of both sides, our friendly relations can be developed in a stable and comprehensive manner."

	During the talks, both sides exchanged views on other international issues of mutual concern and on strengthening relations between the two parties and countries, reaching a consensus.

	Krenz introduced the current situation in the German Democratic Republic. He said that the German Democratic Republic will do its utmost to consolidate the socialist and worker-peasant power of the German Democratic Republic, adhere to the policy of combining continuity and innovation, and build a better German Democratic Republic.

	Krenz emphasized that China's adherence to the socialist path not only serves the interests of the Chinese people but also makes a significant contribution to the world.

	Jo Chi pointed out that China fully understands the situation of the German Democratic Republic and supports the German Democratic Republic's party and government in adhering to socialism, safeguarding national sovereignty, and opposing any activities aimed at undermining the socialist system of the German Democratic Republic.

	Wolfgang Rauhfus, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and other members of the delegation; Zhu Liang, a member of the Central Committee of the CPC and Director of the International Liaison Department, and Li Shuzhen, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the CPC and Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department, participated in the talks.

	After the talks, Jo Chi hosted a banquet for Krenz and his delegation. Li Tieming, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a member of the State Council, attended the banquet.
