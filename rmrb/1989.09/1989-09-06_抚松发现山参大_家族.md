Recently, three ginseng farmers in Fushu County, known as the "ginseng hometown" in the heart of Changbai Mountain, discovered a rare "family" of wild ginseng in a dense forest at an altitude of 700 meters.

When this family of wild ginseng was discovered, 17 ginseng plants were found growing closely together. Among these 17 wild ginseng plants of varying sizes, the youngest was over 100 years old, while the oldest was over 500 years old. The total weight of these ginseng plants was 725 grams, with individual weights ranging from 7.5 grams to 305 grams. One particularly large old wild ginseng was over 500 years old, weighing 305 grams and measuring 95 centimeters in length. If converted using the old unit of measurement where 16 taels equal one jin, this old ginseng plant weighs 9.76 taels. This is 0.56 taels heavier and 10 centimeters longer than the largest old wild ginseng discovered in Fushu in 1981, which was then the largest in the country.

    抚松发现山参大“家族”
    新华社长春9月6日电　（通讯员徐云）在长白山腹地人参之乡——吉林省抚松县，3位参农最近在海拔700米的深山密林中发现了一处罕见的山参“家族”。
    这个山参“家族”被发现时，17棵参密集成一“窝”。17棵大小山参中，参龄最小的100余岁，参龄最大的500多岁。这些山参的总计重量达725克，单棵重量从7.5克到305克不等。有一棵特大老山参，已经500余岁，重305克，长95厘米。如果按16两一斤的老秤折算，这苗老山参重9.76两，比1981年也在抚松境内发现的当时国内最大的老山参重0.56两、长10厘米。
