**A New Chapter in the Blue Sky – A Report on China's Civil Aviation Exhibition**

**By Zhang Heping, People's Daily Reporter**

**April 29, 1986. Hefei, Anhui.**

The airport was adorned with colorful flags. People were eagerly awaiting a solemn moment in the history of Chinese aviation.

At 10 a.m., three signal flares pierced the clear sky, and a silver-gray medium-range passenger aircraft taxied down the runway and took off! The airport erupted in jubilation!

This was the first passenger flight of China's domestically produced Y-7 aircraft, marking the end of an era when domestic routes were dominated by foreign aircraft. The vast blue sky witnessed a glorious chapter in China's aviation industry!

Today, 52 domestically produced Y-7 aircraft soar across more than 70 routes in China, transporting over 100,000 passengers, both domestic and international. The Y-7 has become the largest fleet in China's civil aviation. Just days ago, more exciting news came in: by the beginning of September this year, the Y-7 aircraft had accumulated 100,000 safe flight hours and 100,000 takeoffs and landings.

**Self-Made**

**The 1980s.**

When the veil of mystery over the military industry was lifted, people were amazed to discover that the strength of China's aviation industry, previously little-known, was so formidable! Over the past 30 years, the aviation industry had successfully completed the journey from repair and imitation to independent design and manufacturing, with hundreds of thousands of scientific and technical personnel, workers, and cadres providing the country with more than 10,000 aircraft.

However, people were also surprised to find that the aircraft flying on domestic routes were all foreign-made! This was a stark and unpleasant contradiction. People longed to board domestically produced passenger aircraft.

In October 1981, at a Politburo meeting, Deng Xiaoping proposed with far-sighted vision: "Domestic routes should consider domestic production of aircraft." Soon after, he reiterated: "In the future, domestic civil aviation aircraft should be domestically produced."

The Party Central Committee and the State Council placed the development of domestically produced aircraft on the important agenda.

**The Handsome Youth**

The development of the Y-7 aircraft began in the mid-1960s. Under the care of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Ye Jianying, on December 25, 1970, China's first domestically produced Y-7 aircraft took its maiden flight. "Taking to the skies is difficult, and certification is even harder." At that time, during a period of turmoil, the development work was extremely challenging. The aircraft could not be certified and put into production.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the call of domestic routes accelerated the development of the Y-7 aircraft. In July 1982, after completing a series of tests and flights, especially the high-difficulty single-engine takeoff and landing tests, the state approved the design certification and small-scale production of the Y-7 aircraft.

Reform and opening up added luster to the Y-7. To make the Y-7 more safe, reliable, comfortable, and economical, in 1985, the Xi'an Aircraft Manufacturing Company cooperated with the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company to introduce advanced foreign equipment, upgrading the Y-7's communication, navigation, radar, cockpit decoration, environmental control, and living facilities.

In the early winter of 1985, the upgraded Y-7-100 aircraft and the multi-purpose Y-12-II aircraft flew directly to the capital airport, standing proudly to receive the inspection of Party and state leaders. Comrade Wan Li praised the two aircraft, saying they were well-made. After flying in the Y-7 over the airport, Comrade Li Peng happily said, "The performance is excellent!"

At the capital airport, then Vice Premier Li Peng presided over a State Council Civil Aviation Office meeting. The meeting clearly pointed out: "Such a large country cannot rely on buying foreign aircraft for a long time. We must gradually rely on domestic production." The meeting also decided: "Currently, except for long-distance international routes and domestic trunk routes that still need to be imported, provincial and inter-provincial feeder routes should use more Y-7 aircraft, and generally, no more imports will be made." Soon, the central government approved the inclusion of civil aircraft development in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and allocated funds to support it. The Civil Aviation Administration decided to purchase 15 aircraft during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" and another 40 during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." The Y-7 aircraft joined civil aviation flights, marking a new chapter for China's aircraft manufacturing industry and opening up broad prospects for China's civil aviation to use more domestically produced aircraft.

It is said that Comrade Zhang Aiping, who had devoted his heart to the development of the Y-7 aircraft, did not hide his fondness for this "national pride," describing it with the words "handsome youth." Since then, the nickname "handsome youth" has spread. Three years later, the "youth" has grown into adulthood and is even more robust. The engine's first overhaul life has been extended to 2500 hours, and the life of most onboard equipment has been extended to over 4000 hours.

Today, the "handsome youth" not only soars in the blue skies of the motherland but has also entered international route operations, becoming an air bridge connecting the peoples of China and North Korea.

**Opening Up in All Directions**

After the Party and government decided to accelerate the development of civil aircraft and include it in the list of major national technological equipment, the development of civil aircraft rapidly progressed, showing a trend of multi-faceted development in passenger and cargo transportation, multi-purpose and specialized, and large, medium, and small.

The domestically produced Y-8 transport aircraft, known as the "Sky Giant," has been in use domestically since it was certified in 1980, with dozens of aircraft. It has frequently crossed the roof of the world, carrying goods into Tibet, and flown to every province and region in the country except Taiwan. In December 1985, the first domestically produced Y-8 "Black Hawk" aircraft, carrying a helicopter, successfully took its maiden flight;

More than 900 aircraft have been delivered, earning the reputation of "Tianshan Eagle, Forestation Expert," and "Short-haul Airliner." The Y-5 aircraft has undergone modifications. The first modified aircraft, Y-5B, took to the skies at the end of 1987;

In late 1985, China's newly developed multi-purpose helicopter, the Z-8, successfully took its maiden flight in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi;

In 1986, the new "Seagull" specialized aircraft successfully test-flew in Nanchang, adding a new model to China's civil aircraft series;

Last autumn, the cargo version of the Y-7 aircraft also took its maiden flight in Xi'an Yanliang. It will accompany the passenger version of the Y-7 aircraft as it soars through the skies;

In China's general aviation fleet, the mainstay is the Y-11 small multi-purpose aircraft, which is mainly used for agricultural and forestry operations and is undergoing improvements. The improved Y-11B and Y-11A will take to the skies in the next two years; a new type of agricultural aircraft, the N-5, is under development and is expected to take its maiden flight by the end of this year; the Y-7-200B with better performance and the Y-8C type aircraft with a sealed cabin will be expected to take to the skies next year; ...

**Soaring to the World**

China's aviation industry is still young. When it stepped into the world of aviation with a vigorous stride, it attracted attention. In September 1986, the Farnborough International Airshow in the UK; in April 1987, the Hannover International Trade Fair in the Federal Republic of Germany; in June 1987, the Paris International Airshow... When China's various military and civil aircraft, models, and pictures were displayed in front of Westerners, they caused quite a stir.

"The progress of Chinese aviation technology is really surprising!" International aviation colleagues exclaimed. "China has produced cost-effective aircraft," local newspapers commented, using the phrases "strong interest" and "great interest" to describe the response to China's exhibition. Many businessmen showed a keen interest in Chinese civil aircraft and expressed their intention to purchase.

On November 13, 1986, the zero record was broken! Two Y-12 aircraft were loaded onto trucks in Harbin and shipped overseas from the port of Shanghai, ending the history of China's civil aircraft not being able to be exported.

Following the export of the Y-12, in December 1987, two Y-8 aircraft crossed the ocean and flew to the world!

In the past decade, China's aviation industry has taken the road of relying on the domestic market and cooperating with the outside world. With the development of feeder aircraft and specialized aircraft, the development of trunk aircraft has become a new goal for China's aviation industry. China's aviation industry has eight major aircraft and engine companies (factories) that have, through compensation trade and other means, successively manufactured aircraft parts for more than ten countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Canada, Italy, and Sweden. The manufactured products have gradually transitioned from simple parts with relatively simple technology to large components with high difficulty, and can now manufacture the vertical tail of the Boeing 737-300 passenger aircraft and are about to produce the nose of the medium-range jet passenger aircraft MD-82, step by step approaching trunk aircraft.

On July 2, 1987, the first MD-82 aircraft jointly produced by China and the American McDonnell Douglas Company took off from Shanghai Dacang Airport. After a successful test flight, the MD-82 passenger aircraft was immediately handed over to China's civil aviation for use. According to the agreement, by 1991, the two sides will jointly produce 25 MD-82 aircraft. Currently, the ninth aircraft has been delivered.

China and the German MBB company have signed a preliminary development agreement for the 70-90 seat MPC-75 passenger aircraft, and cooperation is underway.

The development of trunk aircraft is the dream of several generations of people in China's aviation industry. This will surely be a new takeoff!

    万里蓝天新一页
    ——我国民用飞机民展纪实
    本报记者　张何平
    1986年4月29日。安徽合肥。
    飞机场上，彩旗飘扬。人们以激动兴奋的心情，等待着中国航空史上的一个庄严时刻。
    上午10点，3颗信号弹划破晴空，1架银白色的中短程客机滑出跑道，腾空而起！机场上下顿时一片欢腾！
    这是我国制造的运七飞机首次载客飞行。从此结束了国内航线由外国飞机垄断的历史。万里蓝天写下了中国航空工业光辉的一页！
    如今，52架国产运七飞机翱翔在祖国大江南北的70多条航线上，运送国内外乘客100多万人次。运七已成为我国民航的最大机群。几天前，又传来振奋人心的消息：到今年9月上旬，运七飞机已累计安全飞行10万小时，起落10万架次。自　己　制　造
    二十世纪八十年代。
    当蒙在军事工业身上的神秘面纱被轻轻揭开之后，人们惊奇地发现，过去少有所闻的祖国航空工业的实力竟是如此强大！30年来，航空工业胜利地走完了从修理、仿制到自行设计研制的光辉历程，数十万名科技人员、工人和干部向国家提供了万余架雄鹰。
    然而，人们又惊奇地发现，在国内航线上飞行的，竟又是清一色的外国客机！这是多么矛盾、多么令人不快的事实啊！人们盼望着乘坐自己的国产客机。
    1981年10月，在政治局会议上，邓小平同志高瞻远瞩地提出：“国内航线的飞机要考虑自己制造。”不久，他再次强调：“今后国内民航飞机要用国产飞机”。
    党中央、国务院把发展国产飞机摆上重要议事日程。英　俊　少
　年
    运七飞机的研制始自六十年代中后期。在周恩来总理、中央军委副主席叶剑英的关怀下，1970年12月25日，我国自制的第一架运七飞机首次试飞上天。“上天不易，定型更难”。当时处于动乱时期，研制工作相当困难。飞机迟迟不能定型投产。
    十一届三中全会的春风，国内航线的呼唤，加快了运七飞机的研制过程。1982年7月，在完成了一系列试验、试飞，特别是高难度的单发动机起降试飞等项目之后，国家批准运七飞机设计定型投入小批量生产。
    改革、开放，使运七“锦上添花”。为了使运七更为安全、可靠、舒适、经济，1985年，西安飞机制造公司同香港飞机工程公司合作，引进国外先进设备，对运七的通讯、导航、雷达以及座舱装饰、环境控制和生活设施进行了改装。
    1985年初冬，改装后的运七—100型飞机和运十二—Ⅱ型多用途飞机直飞首都机场，英姿勃勃地接受党和国家领导人的检阅。万里同志称赞这两架飞机造得好。乘坐运七在机场上空飞行之后，李鹏同志高兴地说：“性能不错！”
    在首都机场，由当时的副总理李鹏同志主持召开了国务院民航办公会议。会议明确指出：“我们这么大的国家，发展航空工业不能长期靠买外国飞机过日子，必须逐步立足于国内。”会议还作出决定：目前，除远距离的国际航线和国内干线飞机还需要进口外，省内省际支线飞机要多采用运七飞机，一般不再进口。不久，中央批准把民用飞机发展列入“七五”发展规划，并拨款支持。国家民航局决定“六五”期间购买15架，“七五”再买40架。运七飞机加入民航飞行，为中国飞机制造工业揭开了新的一页，也为中国民用航空运输更多地使用国产飞机，开创了广阔前景。
    听说，曾经对运七飞机的研制付出心血的张爱萍同志毫不掩饰对这个“国之骄子”的偏爱，他以“英俊少年”四个字来形容它。从此，“英俊少年”的称号不胫而走。时隔三年，
  “少年”已长大成人，愈为健壮。发动机首次翻修寿命已延长到2500小时，绝大多数机载设备寿命已延长到四千小时以上。
    如今，“英俊少年”不仅在祖国的蓝天翱翔，还投入国际航线运营，成为联结中朝两国人民的空中纽带。四　处　开　放在党和政府决定加快发展民用飞机，并把它列入国家重大技术装备之后，民用飞机研制迅速发展，呈现客货运输结合、多用途型和专业化结合、大中小相结合的多元发展趋势。
    被称为“空中大力士”的国产运八运输机，自1980年定型生产以来，已有数十架在国内使用。它多次穿越世界屋脊，载货进藏，飞遍了除台湾省外的全国各省区。1985年12月，首架国产运八“黑鹰”载机，装载直升机首飞成功；
    出厂900多架，被誉为“天山雄鹰、造林能手”，“短途运输空中客车”的运五飞机进行了改型。第一架改型机运五B于1987年底飞向云霄；
    1985年底，我国研制的新型多用途直升机——直八在江西景德镇市首飞成功；
    1986年，“海燕”新型专业飞机在南昌试飞成功，为我国民用飞机系列增添了新品种；
    去年秋天，运七货运型飞机又在西安阎良首飞上天，它将作为运七客运型飞机的“孪生兄弟”相伴遨游；
    在我国通用航空机群中堪称主力的，以农林作业为主的运十一小型多用途飞机正在进行改进改型，改进后的运十一B、运十一A将分别于明后两年上天；一种新型农业飞机—农五，正在研制中，今年底可望首飞；性能更好的运七—200B和改密封舱的运八C型飞机，预计明年上天；……飞　向　世　界
    中国的航空工业还很年轻，当它以矫健的步伐迈入世界航空领域的大门时，引起了人们的关注。1986年9月，英国范堡罗国际航展；1987年4月，联邦德国汉诺威国际博览会；1987年6月，巴黎国际航空博览会……当中国各种军、民用飞机的实物和模型、图片，展示在西方人士面前时，曾产生不小的轰动。
      “中国航空技术进步之快，实在令人吃惊！”国际航空界同行赞叹。“中国推出了物美价廉的飞机”，当地报纸评论，并以“强烈关注，极大兴趣”的字样来形容中国参展引起的反响。不少客商对中国民用飞机产生浓厚兴趣，表示购买的意向。
    1986年11月13日，零的纪录突破了！两架运十二飞机在哈尔滨装车起运，由上海港运往国外，从而结束了中国民用飞机不能出口的历史。
    继运十二出口之后，1987年12月，两架运八飞机跨越大洋，飞向世界！
    近十年来，中国航空工业走的是立足国内、对外合作的道路。随着支线飞机和专业飞机的发展，干线飞机的研制已成为中国航空工业追求的新目标。我国航空工业已有八家主要的飞机、发动机公司（厂）通过补偿贸易等方式，先后为美国、英国、联邦德国、法国、加拿大、意大利、瑞典等十几个国家制造飞机零部件。承制产品从工艺、技术较简单的零件，逐步过渡到技术高难的大型部件，已经能够制造波音七三七—300客机的垂直尾翼，并即将投产中短程喷气客机MD—82的机头，一步步向干线飞机接近。
    1987年7月2日，由我国与美国麦道公司合作生产的首架MD—82飞机在上海大场机场跃入云端。试飞成功后，这架MD—82客机立即交付中国民航使用。按照协议，到1991年，双方将联合制造25架MD—82。目前，已交付第九架。
    我国与联邦德国MBB公司共同发展的70至90座位的MPC—75客机的预发展协议已经签订，合作正在进行。
    研制干线飞机是我国航空界几代人梦寐以求的理想。这必将是一次新的起飞！
