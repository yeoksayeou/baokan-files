China's work in researching and collecting crop variety resources has achieved significant success.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, a large number of scientists and technicians have persistently conducted investigations and research in remote mountainous areas and organized large-scale mass collection activities. They have collected approximately 300,000 varieties of crop resources and introduced more than 40,000 varieties of crop resources from abroad. This has brought the total number of crop varieties in China to 350,000, making China one of the countries with the largest number of crop varieties in the world.

Crop variety resources are akin to the steel, coal, and oil used in industry, representing a vast resource second only to soil, air, and water, playing a decisive role in agricultural production. There are thousands of plants that humans can consume, but only about a dozen provide the majority of our food. There is tremendous potential here. China has established two modern national gene banks in Beijing. One of the banks is maintained at a temperature of -10 degrees Celsius, and the other at -18 degrees Celsius, capable of storing over 500,000 samples. It is one of the largest gene banks in the world for long-term preservation. Additionally, some of these materials have undergone quality, stress resistance, and pest resistance identification, and a number of materials with various resistances have been screened out, some of which have already been directly used in production. China has also engaged in the exchange of genetic resources with over 100 countries and international organizations, establishing a network for the introduction of foreign varieties and the exchange of genetic resources with other countries. Through the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for scientific and technological research, a professional team of over 2,500 people from more than 400 units has been organized.

    科技人员四十年辛勤收集
    我成为农作物品种资源大国
    本报北京9月9日讯　记者蒋建科报道：我国农作物品种资源研究收集工作取得重大成就。
    建国40年来，广大科技人员长期坚持在边远山区调查研究，组织大规模群众性征集活动，共收集约30余万份品种资源，从国外引进4万余份作物品种资源，使我国现有农作物品种资源达35万份，成为世界上拥有作物品种资源数量最多的大国之一。
    作物品种资源犹如工业所用的钢铁、煤炭、石油，是仅次于土壤、空气和水的巨大资源，在农业生产上起着决定性的作用。人类能够食用的植物达数千种，现在为人们大量提供粮食的才10多种，具有很大潜力。我国已在北京建成两座现代化国家种质资源库，一座库温为零下10摄氏度，一座库温为零下18摄氏度，能容纳50余万份材料，是世界上长期保存容量最大的基因库之一。同时，对其中一些材料进行了品质抗逆性和抗病虫鉴定，筛选出一批具有各种抗性的材料，有的已直接用于生产。我国还与100多个国家和国际组织开展了种质资源交换，建起了国外引种和对外交换种质资源的网络。通过“七五”科技攻关，组织了一支由400多个单位2500余人参加的专业科技队伍。
