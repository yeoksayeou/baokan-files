The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, proposed in 1985, came into effect and began implementation on January 1, 1989. This is currently one of the largest regional economic integration groups in the world, and it will have an impact on the future global economy. The U.S. and Canadian economies have long been closely linked. Apart from mutual dependence on traded goods, the two countries have close ties in key sectors such as automobile and aircraft manufacturing. Many U.S. companies operate subsidiaries in Canada. The signing of the agreement merely provides legal assurance for this de facto integrated economy. After the agreement comes into effect, this connection will become even tighter.

Compared to the European Community (EC), the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area started with relatively fewer barriers and obstacles, and it is expected to achieve regional economic integration sooner than the EC. The EC's goal for a unified market is to create a region where goods, people, services, and capital can flow freely. This goal is difficult to achieve by 1992. Before the signing of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, 80% of bilateral trade between the two countries was already duty-free. The agreement stipulates that all tariffs and non-tariff barriers will be eliminated within 10 years, a process expected to be completed ahead of schedule. Additionally, the agreement grants private individuals and companies engaged in cross-border business and commerce in the U.S. and Canada the status of nationals, to be implemented immediately upon the agreement's effective date. It also encourages direct investment between the two countries. Therefore, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area may achieve the four freedoms (free movement of goods, people, services, and capital) and regional economic integration sooner than the EC.

However, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area lacks the robust organizational structure, protective measures, and common policies found in the EC. Therefore, in terms of demonstrating the effects of free trade among nations, it is not as influential as the EC. The main factors leading to the signing of the agreement are:

(1) Both sides sought a way to resolve trade friction. For a long time, the Canadian economy has been heavily dependent on the U.S. market, with a persistent deficit in the current account with the U.S. In the 1980s, the Canadian economy developed rapidly, and its trade with the U.S. shifted from a deficit to a surplus. By 1985, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada was second only to that with Japan. Trade friction between the two countries continued to escalate. To avoid the impact of U.S. trade protectionism, Canada proposed establishing a U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area. Through the signing of the agreement, Canada can enhance its industrial competitiveness, expand employment, and gain a secure and broad market. Canada's economy and various industrial sectors are at a relative disadvantage compared to the U.S. To meet the challenge, in 1988, Canada increased its enterprise investment by 17% to adjust and reallocate resources. After the U.S.-Canada agreement comes into effect, Canada will quickly enter a secure and large market. It is estimated that the agreement will expand Canada's domestic market by nine times.

(2) The signing of the agreement also helps the U.S. enhance its competitiveness against Western Europe and Japan. Canada is the U.S.'s largest energy supplier, with all imported electricity and natural gas coming from Canada, and a significant amount of oil and uranium also imported from Canada. The agreement will secure the U.S.'s energy supply. The U.S. accounts for 77% of foreign direct investment in Canada. It is estimated that after the agreement comes into effect, Canada may have the opportunity to exclude investors from outside North America, which is beneficial for the U.S. The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area will strengthen the U.S.'s bargaining chips against Western Europe and Japan, helping the U.S. and Canada to cope with the increasing competitive threats from Europe and Japan.

The U.S.-Canada agreement has brought different impacts to the two countries. To adapt to the new situation after the establishment of the trade area, some of Canada's industrial sectors have begun to adjust, and a wave of mergers and acquisitions and structural unemployment has emerged. The agreement's impact on Canada's various industrial sectors is different. It will benefit the automobile and food industries. Canada's steel, newsprint, and aluminum industries are among the world's most efficient and competitive, but industries like textiles, furniture, and electronics may face a difficult adjustment period, and employees in these sectors may lose their jobs. Canada's manufacturing industry is undergoing changes, with some factories closing. Mergers and unemployment have become headline news. Canada believes that the current turmoil is a necessary stage for its economy, and through mergers, alliances, and rationalization, it can improve the efficiency and strength of enterprises.

The agreement's impact on Canada's various regions is also different. Some factories and manufacturing industries in Quebec can gain significant profits from tariff exemptions, and Toronto's banks and financial institutions can also find new investment opportunities in the U.S. However, manufacturers in Ontario will face difficulties in capturing market share. The western provinces will benefit greatly from oil, natural gas, and mining, but grain and dairy producers will pay attention to the potential impact of agricultural subsidies.

The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement will promote the formation and cooperation of regional economies and serve as the basis for the U.S. to sign bilateral free trade agreements with the EC, Japan, Asian countries, and Latin American countries. The U.S. government also views the U.S.-Canada agreement as a model for multilateral trade negotiations. It is believed that the agreement has an important impact on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): for example, the agreement's efforts to reduce subsidies, anti-dumping, government procurement, and intellectual property-related trade barriers, as well as to reform the trade system, have a driving effect. The U.S.-Canada agreement has carefully formulated some basic principles for the service sector, such as the national treatment permit system, providing useful precedents for GATT negotiations in these areas.

    美加自由贸易区的现状与前景
    蔡梦桥
    1985年提出的美国和加拿大自由贸易协定已于1989年1月1日生效并开始实施，这是目前世界上最大的一体化区域经济集团之一，它将对今后的世界经济产生影响。美加经济原来就联系密切。除在贸易品方面相互依赖外，两国在汽车和飞机制造等关键部门关系密切。许多美国公司在加经营子公司。协定的签署只是对这种事实上的一体化经济给予法律保证。协定生效后，这种联系将更加紧密。同欧共体相比，美加自由贸易区从起点上就相对的自由和阻力较小，因而预计会比欧共体提前实现区域经济一体化。欧共体统一大市场的目标是：建立一个商品、人员、劳务和资本在这个地区内自由流动的内部市场。这一目标很难说在1992年能实现。而美加在自由贸易协定签订前，其80％的双边贸易就已完全免税。协定中规定的在10年内取消全部关税和非关税壁垒的进程据预计将会提前实现。此外协议规定美加之间给跨边界从事工商业的私人和公司以本国公民待遇，并于协议生效日立即执行。同时还鼓励两国间的直接投资活动。因此美加自由贸易区可能会比欧共体提前实现4个自由流动，进而提前实现该区域经济一体化。
    但美加自由贸易区没有欧共体那样健全的组织机构、保护措施和一些共同政策。因而在实现各国自由贸易的示范效应上，它不如欧共体影响大。协定的签署主要因素是：（一）双方寻求一条解决贸易摩擦的途径。长期以来加拿大经济一直严重依附美国市场，经常项目对美基本处于赤字状态。80年代后加经济发展迅速，对美贸易也从逆差转为盈余。1985年美对加贸易逆差额仅次于日本。两国贸易摩擦不断加剧。为避开美贸易保护主义的打击，加提出了建立加美自由贸易区的建议。通过协定的签署，加可增强本国工业竞争能力，扩大就业，获得有保障的广阔市场。加拿大的经济和各工业领域与美相比，处于相对劣势。为了迎接挑战，1988年，加用以调整和重新配置资源的企业投资增加了17％。美加协议生效后，加将很快进入一个有保障的广大市场，据估计协议将使加国内市场扩大9倍。
      （二）协定的签署也有助于美国提高同西欧和日本的抗衡能力。加是美最大的能源供应国，美进口的电力和天然气全部来自加，并从加进口大量的石油和铀。协定将使美国的能源供应得到保障。美在加的投资额占外国在加直接投资总颇的77％。据估计，协定生效后，加可能排斥北美以外的投资者的机会，这对美国有利。美加自由贸易区将增强美国对西欧、日本的竞争筹码，有助于美加两国对付日益增强的来自欧、日的竞争威胁。
    美加协定已给两国带来了不同的影响。
    为了适应贸易区建立后的新形势，加一些工业部门开始调整，并出现兼并浪潮和结构性失业。协定对加各工业部门影响是不同的。它将使汽车和食品工业获得好处。加的钢铁、新闻纸、铝等是世界上最有效率和最具竞争力的行业，但像纺织、家具和电子产品等工业则可能经历艰难调整时期，在这些部门工作的雇员可能失去工作。加的制造业正在发生变化，有些工厂正在关闭。兼并和失业已成为报刊头条新闻。加认为，目前的混乱是加经济必需经过的阶段，通过兼并、联合和合理化等可提高企业的效率和力量。
    协议对加各地区经济影响不同。魁北克省的一些工厂和制造业可以从免除关税中获得大量利润，多伦多的银行和金融机构亦可寻找对美的新投资机会，但是安大略的制造厂商们将遇到占领市场份额的困难。西部各省，在石油、天然气和采矿业上将获得很大利益，但是谷物和奶制品的生产者，将关注农业补贴问题可能产生的影响。
    美加自由贸易协定会对区域经济的形成和合作起推动作用，将成为美国同欧共体、日本和亚洲各国、以及拉美各国分别签署双边自由贸易协定的基础。美政府还把美加协定看成是多边贸易谈判的一个模式。据认为，该协定对关贸总协定有重要影响：如协定对关贸总协定努力减少补贴、反倾销、政府采购和知识产权方面的贸易壁垒，以及改革贸易制度有推动作用，美加协定对劳务项目精心制定了一些基本原则，如国民待遇许可证等制度，为关贸总协定在这些项目上的谈判提供了有用的先例。
