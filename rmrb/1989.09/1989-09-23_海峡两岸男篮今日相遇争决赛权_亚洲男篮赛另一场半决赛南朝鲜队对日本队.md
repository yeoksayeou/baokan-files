The Chinese men's basketball team and the South Korean team both won their respective matches tonight, securing the top spots in their groups and advancing to the semifinals of the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship.

In the final few matches of the second round tonight, the Chinese team defeated Japan 94-70, South Korea beat Chinese Taipei 112-91, Iran defeated the Philippines 93-86, and unfortunately, Saudi Arabia lost to India by a single point, 72-74. Therefore, the cross-strait rivals will face off on September 23 to compete for a spot in the finals, while Japan will take on South Korea for the other qualifying position.

The match between China and Japan was not as intense as many had anticipated. Although Japan had defeated China in May on home turf, China still managed to secure a comfortable victory tonight. The Chinese team's defense was particularly effective, successfully executing the coach's plan to neutralize the Japanese center, Yoshifumi Yamazaki, who stands over 2.15 meters tall. This significantly reduced his impact on the game. However, China paid a price for this strategy, as their two tallest players, No. 6 Wang Zhi and No. 14 Shan Tao, were both fouled out after committing five personal fouls each. Zhang Yongjun, known for his sharp shooting, scored 33 points, most of which came from three-pointers.

This match revealed some weaknesses in the young Chinese team, particularly their lack of adaptability in high-pressure situations. As the competition intensifies and the teams become more evenly matched, the young Chinese team must address this issue urgently to fully utilize their technical and tactical skills.

Local experts believe that, barring any surprises, China and South Korea will both advance to the finals, setting the stage for a thrilling championship match between the two teams.

    海峡两岸男篮今日相遇争决赛权
    亚洲男篮赛另一场半决赛南朝鲜队对日本队
    本报北京9月22日讯　记者陈昭报道：中国男篮和南朝鲜队今晚分别战胜了各自的对手，以小组第一名的身份进入了第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛的半决赛。
    在今晚进行的复赛阶段最后几场比赛中，中国队以94∶70击败日本队，南朝鲜队以112∶91胜中国台北队，伊朗队以93∶86胜菲律宾队，不走运的沙特阿拉伯队又是以72∶74的一球之差负于印度队。这样，海峡两岸健儿将在23日“同室操戈”，争夺决赛权，而日本队将与南朝鲜队交锋，争夺另一个出线名额。
    中国队和日本队的比赛不像人们事前想像得那么激烈。尽管日本队今年5月在日本本土战胜过中国队，但中国队今晚仍以较大优势击败对手。中国队今晚的防守十分成功，队员们坚决贯彻了教练的意图，遏制了身高超过2.15米的日本队中锋山崎昭史的篮下进攻，使他的威力大大减弱。中国队也为此付出了很大的代价，两名身材最高的队员，6号王治单（2.12米）和14号单涛（2.14米）因5次犯规先后被罚下场。神投手张勇军一人独得33分，其中绝大部分为三分球。
    通过这场比赛，暴露了中国队的年轻队员临场应变能力差等弱点。特别是实力接近、比赛日趋激烈的情况下，如何充分发挥自己的技战术水平，这是年轻的中国队需要解决的迫在眉睫的问题。
    此间权威人士认为，如果不出意外的话，中国队和南朝鲜队应在半决赛中获胜，争冠压轴戏在这两队之间进行。
