In the tropical rainforests on the borders of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Oaxaca states in southeastern Mexico, archaeologists have discovered three ancient temples dating back over three thousand years to the Olmec culture period.

The most astonishing finding from this archaeological excavation is twenty-one wooden sculptures buried in clay soil. Additionally, a collection of tools made from obsidian, necklaces, large machetes, and axes were unearthed. The excavation work is still ongoing. Archaeologists believe that the discovery of the Olmec temples is of comparable significance to the discovery of the magnificent pyramids of Cholula.

The Olmec culture is the earliest and most advanced culture in Mexico, emerging over a thousand years before the Christian era. It predates the famous Maya civilization. The Olmec people invented pictographic writing, mathematical systems, and calendars, and were capable of carving colossal stone heads weighing over thirty tons from single blocks. The Olmec culture is considered the forerunner of Mexico's "Classical Period" cultures, but for unknown reasons, this ancient culture later disappeared, and this mystery remains to be unraveled.

    墨发现奥尔麦克文化古庙
    在墨西哥东南部韦腊克鲁斯州、塔巴斯科州和瓦哈卡州边境地区的热带原始森林中，考古学家发现三座三千多年前奥尔麦克文化时期的古庙。
    这次考古取得的最令人惊异的成果是，埋在粘土性土壤中的二十一件木雕像。此外，还发现一批用黑曜石做的刀具、项链、大砍刀和斧子。发掘工作至今尚未结束。考古学家认为，奥尔麦克古庙的发现，其珍贵价值可与发现雄伟的乔卢拉金字塔相比。
    奥尔麦克文化是墨西哥最早和发展较高的文化，出现在公元前一千多年，早于世界著名古文明之一的玛雅文化。奥尔麦克人创造了象形文字、计算法和历法，能用整块巨石雕凿重达三十多吨的人头像。奥尔麦克文化被认为是墨西哥“古典期”文化的先驱，但这一古老文化以后不知什么原因消失了，至今这仍是个有待揭开的谜。
