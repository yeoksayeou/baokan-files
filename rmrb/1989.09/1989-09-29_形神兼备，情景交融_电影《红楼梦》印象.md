Adapting "Dream of the Red Chamber," a literary masterpiece with a vast background, numerous characters, profound themes, and delicate emotions, into a film is a monumental task. The novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" has rich ideological content, but two points stand out: first, it depicts the decay of the feudal system and its inevitable collapse through the rise and fall of the Jia family; second, it expresses the awakening of human nature and the call for individual liberation through the pure love story of Baoyu and Daia. Directed by Xie Tie Lin, the film "Dream of the Red Chamber" uses the love story of Baoyu and Daiyu as the main thread and the rise and fall of the Jia mansion as the backdrop, essentially capturing the original work's ideological essence.

Xie Tie Lin employs grand and dramatic techniques, vivid contrasts, and heavy ink strokes when depicting typical environments and social tragedies. For example, the funeral of Qin Keqing and the imperial princess's visit in the first part are both vivid and emotionally intense "grand scenes." When portraying the love story of Baoyu and Daiyu, he uses meticulous brushwork, creating a subtle, restrained, and gentle lyrical style. As their love deepens, the shadow of crisis looms, and the tragic ending approaches, the emotions become increasingly intense. "Fragrant Flowers on a Sunny Day" depicts the innocent love of childhood; "The Bridge of Love" and "Zi Yu's Confession" show deep affection; Daiyu burning her manuscripts and Baoyu weeping at her grave depict an intense, heart-wrenching, and sincere love. In a romantic and fantastical setting, Baoyu's inner feelings for Daiyu are externalized and fully developed, reaching a climax. Here, Xie Tie Lin demonstrates the powerful expressive force and unique charm of film art.

The performances in "Dream of the Red Chamber" strive for spiritual authenticity. Liu Xiaqing's portrayal of Wang Xifeng in the scenes "Managing Ningguo Mansion" and "Manipulating Power at Tieji Temple" can be described as "radiant and brilliant." Wang Xifeng is a complex character with a beautiful appearance, a fiery personality, sharp wit, cunning, a cruel heart, smooth talk, and pretentious behavior. Liu Xiaqing brings this multifaceted character to life vividly.

Lin Moyu's performance is subtle and profound. Her portrayal of Jia Mu, the matriarch, is dignified and majestic, exuding an air of nobility. Jia Mu is confident in her authority within the family. In the feudal aristocracy, she is a figure of great virtue and wisdom, a benevolent and kind elder, and a gentle and enlightened host. She loves Baoyu and Daiyu but also unwittingly contributes to their tragedy, which is itself a great tragedy for Jia Mu. Lin Moyu portrays this complex yet unified character with depth and authenticity.

Li Xiuming's portrayal of Yuanchun showcases the collaborative strength of the entire production team, including the scriptwriter, director, actors, cinematographer, sound designer, and art director. "The Imperial Princess's Visit" is a grand scene, occupying half of the first part. It relies neither on the plot nor on dialogue. In this half of the film, the protagonist Yuanchun has only 207 lines of dialogue, truly embodying the idea of "meaning beyond words." However, every scene, color, and light in the film seems to speak, to express emotions. The high walls and tightly closed palace gates symbolize the prison of human nature; the grand procession and solemn royal ceremonies create a chasm of human affection. Yuanchun rides a colorful boat through a forest of fire and silver flowers, a scene of opulence and luxury, but the lights seem to be shrouded in a layer of sad and mournful mist, giving a sense of cold detachment, reflecting the protagonist's loneliness and sadness. The actress uses just two words, "excuse," and a stream of tears falling on Baoyu's cheek to express the character's deep sorrow. Li Xiuming's acting skills are fully displayed.

When discussing the film adaptation of "Dream of the Red Chamber," I had an idea that Xie Tie Lin and his generation of artists have a firm artistic vision, believing that the main characters like Baoyu and Daiyu should be "protected," preventing them from doing anything that might damage their image. In the film "Dream of the Red Chamber," the images of Baoyu and Daiyu, especially Baoyu, are "purified," like two pieces of white silk, though slightly flawed, they remain pure. Whether this is a gain or a loss involves a series of theoretical issues such as the artist's aesthetic beliefs, taste, and creative personality, as well as the direct impact of film characteristics on social effects, which are difficult to discuss in detail at this time. I look forward to watching the film a few more times for further exploration.

After reading the six-part, eight-episode film adaptation and watching parts of the film, my overall impression is: this is a work that is faithful to the original while fully utilizing the unique features of film art; it is realistic yet rich in romanticism; it achieves the state of "form and spirit in harmony, emotion and scene blended"; it has a profound and elegant style; the techniques are delicate, making it a rare film.

### 形神兼备，情景交融——电影《红楼梦》印象

    形神兼备，情景交融
    ——电影《红楼梦》印象
    德　波
    把《红楼梦》这部背景宏大、人物众多、意境深远、情感细腻的文学巨著搬上银幕，是一个浩大的系统工程。小说《红楼梦》的思想内涵极其丰富，但有两点是最主要的：一是通过贾氏大家族由盛到衰的过程写出封建制度的腐朽性和它崩溃的必然性；二是通过宝黛纯真的爱情写出了人性的觉醒和呼唤个性解放的人文主义精神。谢铁骊执导的电影《红楼梦》以宝、黛爱情为主线，以贾府的盛衰为背景，基本上体现了原著的思想内涵。
    谢铁骊在展现典型环境和表现“社会悲剧”部分，有时使用大起大落、浓墨重彩、对比分明的手法，如第一部的“秦可卿出殡”和“元妃省亲”都是色彩鲜明、情绪浓重的“大块文章”。在表现宝黛爱情时则使用精雕细琢的工笔画手法，具有淡雅含蓄、柔和抒情的格调。随着他们爱情的加深，危机阴影的笼罩和悲剧结局临近，情绪渐次浓重而强烈。“晴日玉生香”表现少年时期“两小无猜”的纯情；
  “蜂腰桥传心事”、“紫鹃情词试莽玉”表现的是鲜明的痴情；黛玉焚稿和宝玉哭灵则表现出极其强烈的刻骨铭心的、至诚至勇的至情。在充满浪漫主义色彩的奇情幻境中，把贾宝玉对林黛玉的内心情感外化，并充分加以推展、延伸，达到饱和点。在这里，谢铁骊显示了电影艺术的强大表现力和它不可取代的魅力。
      《红》片的表演力求神似。刘晓庆饰演的王熙凤从她“协理宁国府”、“弄权铁槛寺”两场的表现，可以称得起“神采奕奕、光芒四射”八个大字。王熙凤的容貌艳丽、性格泼辣、机敏乖觉、工于心计、心肠狠毒、巧言令色、装腔作势……这是一个由多种元素、多种色彩构成的典型形象，被刘晓庆演得活灵活现。
    林默予的表演含蓄凝重，她所饰演的贾母雍容大度，具有大家气派。贾母对于她在这个大家族中至高无上的权威有充分自信，在封建贵族中，她是明大义、识大体的人物，是慈祥宽厚的长者，也是温和开明的主人；她最爱宝玉和黛玉，却又亲手制造了他们的悲剧，而这对贾母本身何尝不是个大悲剧呢？林默予把这个复杂而又统一的性格演得真切而有深度。
    由李秀明饰演的元春形象显示出编、导、演、摄、音、美整体配合的“合力优势”。
  “元妃省亲”是大块文章，在第一部下集中占有一半重量，它靠不上情节帮忙，也沾不上语言的光。在这半部影片中，主人公元春只有207个字的台词，可以说是“意在言外”了。但影片中的一切景物、色彩、光线似乎都在说话，都有表情。万宫墙、紧闭的宫门像是闭锁人性的牢狱；气势浩大的仪仗队、隆重的君臣礼仪使人感到是隔人伦之情的鸿沟。元春乘彩船游于火树银花之中，场面虽然豪华奢丽，但那些灯火似乎被蒙上一层悲凉哀怨的雾气，倒给人一种“身外之物”的冷漠感，映衬着景中人孤独和悲凉心情。演员只用两声“免”字和洒在宝玉脸颊上的一串悲泪，便表达出人物压抑在心中的无穷的哀怨。李秀明的演技得到了极好的发挥。
    从《红楼梦》电影改编本讨论时，我就有一个想法，觉得谢铁骊和他们这一代艺术家已经有了一个十分坚定的艺术见解，认为对于作品中的正面主人公如宝玉、黛玉，应当加以“保护”，不使他们做出什么“有损于自己形象”的事情。在《红楼梦》影片中，宝黛两个形象，特别是宝玉的形象是被“纯净化”了，犹如两块白绢，虽有微疵却也不失为洁白。究竟得失如何？这涉及艺术家的美学信念、审美趣味、创作个性等一系列理论问题，又有电影的直观特点可能引起的社会效果等诸多相关问题，一时难以细论，我愿多看几遍影片后作进一步探讨。
    读了六部八集电影改编本，看了部分影片，总的印象是：这是一部忠于原著又充分发挥电影艺术特点的作品；真实又富于浪漫主义色彩；达到了“形神兼备、情景交融”的境界；格调宏深雅丽；手法细腻，是一部难得的电影。
