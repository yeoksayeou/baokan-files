Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu Junichiro arrived in Washington today from San Francisco for an official visit. This is his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago.

An official from the State Department said that President Bush will interrupt his vacation in Maine to meet with Prime Minister Kaifu in Washington on Friday. He added that Bush will emphasize the importance of bilateral talks between the U.S. and Japan and his desire to further advance the relationship between the two countries, particularly focusing on U.S.-Japan trade relations.

Japanese diplomats here revealed that during his three-day visit to the U.S., Kaifu will focus on discussing bilateral trade relations with American leaders, as well as issues related to shared defense responsibilities, strengthening military cooperation, environmental concerns, and third-world debt.

Upon arriving in the West Coast city of San Francisco yesterday, Kaifu told reporters that various trade restrictions in the U.S.-Japan trade will hinder the further development of relations between the two countries. He emphasized that the purpose of this visit is to strengthen relations between the two countries.

Kaifu also said at a welcome dinner hosted by Japanese expatriates that the relationship between the U.S. and Japan will no longer be that of a protector and a protected, or a teacher and a student.

In recent years, the U.S.-Japan trade war has intensified, resulting in a massive $24.5 billion trade deficit for the U.S. with Japan, which has forced the U.S. to exert pressure on Japan, causing friction in the two countries' "partnership" relationship. Therefore, diplomatic observers here believe that Kaifu's mission on this visit is daunting.

    首次出国访问　加强日美关系
    日本首相海部抵达华盛顿
    新华社华盛顿8月31日电  （记者魏国强）日本新首相海部俊树今天从旧金山到达华盛顿进行正式访问。这是他三星期前出任首相后第一次出国访问。
    国务院的一位官员说，布什总统将中断在缅因州的渡假生活，于星期五在华盛顿会见海部首相。他还说，布什将强调美日双边会谈的重要性和将两国关系进一步推进的愿望，他将特别强调美日贸易关系。
    此间日本外交官透露，海部在美国为期三天的访问中将同美国领导人着重探讨双边贸易关系问题，并讨论共同承担防务和加强军事合作以及环境和第三世界债务等问题。
    海部首相于昨天到达美国西海岸城市旧金山后对记者说，美日贸易方面的各种限制措施会抑制两国关系的进一步发展。他强调此行的目的是要加强两国间的关系。
    海部还在日本侨民欢迎他的晚宴上说，美日两国关系将不再是过去那种保护者与被保护者、老师与学生式的关系。
    近年来美日贸易战不断加剧，造成美国对日贸易产生245亿美元的巨额赤字，从而迫使美国对日本施加压力，两国“伙伴”关系不断出现磨擦。因此，此间外交观察家们认为，海部此行的任务是艰巨的。
