		The Awakening of Ujimqin Grassland

		"If we compare the grassland's self-sufficient natural economy of thousands of years to a long, deep sleep, then Ujimqin Grassland has awakened from this long slumber!" said Zhaolunbateer, the flag chief of East Ujimqin Banner, proudly to the reporter.

		The words of this energetic Mongolian cadre are indeed accurate. The reporter drove across Ujimqin Grassland and saw that the nomadic lifestyle of self-sufficiency that the herders had maintained for thousands of years has ended. The single-industry structure of livestock farming in the pastoral areas has been broken. Livestock farming centered on breeding has flourished, and the livestock processing industry is burgeoning. The Ujimqin Grassland, which had been dormant in the atmosphere of a natural economy, has indeed awakened.

		In the depths of Ujimqin Grassland, in the town of Baiyin Huobuer Su, the reporter visited the Mongolian herder Yidamu. This courageous wrestler, renowned across the grasslands, is now a famous model of commodity production. Six years ago, his family had only 300 head of livestock. Now, he raises over 400 head of livestock each year. Yidamu told the reporter: "In the past, I was content with the old way of life, selling skins, wool, and meat, just enough to eat and wear. Now, I have become a new herder, developing commodity production. Since the pastoral reforms of 1983, I have built over 500 square meters of sheds, dug two wells, enclosed over 10,000 mu of grasslands, and purchased cars, tractors, mowers, and rakes, completely changing my past production and living methods. By this year, my family's livestock has grown to over 2,000 head. The production of wool, fur, and skins, as well as the number of livestock raised, has increased by 5 to 10 times compared to six years ago. My pure income has also surged from over 2,000 yuan to over 70,000 yuan."

		Zhaolunbateer introduced that since the reforms, advanced herders like Yidamu have emerged in large numbers on Ujimqin Grassland. Under their leadership, tens of thousands of herders in East Ujimqin Banner have abandoned the backward production method of following water and grass, and have embarked on the path of settled grazing and developing a commodity economy. This year, the number of livestock in East Ujimqin Banner has grown from less than a million six years ago to 1.85 million, making it the leading banner and county in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It has become an important commodity base for livestock farming in the country and the autonomous region.

		After bidding farewell to Yidamu, the reporter arrived at the flag capital of Wuliyaosutai Town in East Ujimqin Banner. Before his eyes was a bustling scene: the wool mill's workshop was filled with the roar of machinery, the meat processing plant's construction site was bustling with activity, workers in the leather goods factory were drying skins in the courtyard, and workers in the bone and blood powder factory were sorting piles of bones. A few years ago, this small town on the grassland was quiet and desolate, but now it has become a thriving industrial new town.

		Several factory directors told the reporter that in the past, the single-industry structure of livestock farming had caused Ujimqin Grassland to suffer greatly: from liberation to 1978, over a span of 30 years, East Ujimqin Banner sold 2.82 million cow and sheep skins and 250,000 tons of wool as raw materials at low prices to other places, losing a significant amount of added value from processing; 5 million head of livestock were driven thousands of miles to be sold elsewhere, and just the weight loss during transportation amounted to 35,000 tons of meat, reducing income by 1.5 billion yuan. These two accounts have awakened people: to revitalize Ujimqin Grassland, we must vigorously develop the livestock product processing industry and completely change the old pattern of the natural economy.

		Building industry on the grassland faces the biggest challenge of lacking technology and talent. To solve these problems, since 1984, Deputy Flag Chief Liu Baoming, who is in charge of industry, has led relevant personnel to travel extensively, successively inviting over 300 experts, scholars, and technical personnel from within and outside the region to help the banner with industrial development surveys, planning, and design, and to guide the construction, production, and management of factories. At the same time, the banner has sent over 200 people to study relevant production technologies and management knowledge elsewhere, establishing its own technical backbone team.

		In just six years, East Ujimqin Banner has built a wool textile mill, a beef and mutton processing plant, a horse meat processing plant, and a bone and blood powder plant. It has also renovated and expanded the leather goods factory and dairy factory, forming a livestock product processing industrial system that includes wool, fur, leather, meat, dairy, bone, blood, and viscera. The products are popular both within and outside the region, and the economic benefits have significantly increased. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 33.14 million yuan, an increase of eight times compared to before these factories were established. Liu Baoming said well: "The history of Ujimqin Grassland producing and exporting only livestock raw materials has ended. The ancient grassland has entered a new stage of commodity production where pastoral and industrial sectors are organically combined, mutually promoting, and developing in harmony."

### 醒来了，乌珠穆沁草原

专栏：社会主义事业在前进

　　　醒来了，乌珠穆沁草原
      “如果把草原千百年来自给自足的自然经济比作沉沉长梦，那么，乌珠穆沁草原已经从这沉沉长梦中醒来了！”东乌珠穆沁旗旗长朝伦巴特尔自豪地对记者说。
    这位精干的蒙古族干部所言的确不差。记者驱车遍访乌珠穆沁草原，看到牧民们延续了千百年的自给自足的游牧生活结束了，牧区单一的畜牧业经济结构被打破了，以建设养畜为核心的畜牧业商品生产蓬勃发展，畜产品加工业方兴未艾，在自然经济的氛围中沉睡的乌珠穆沁草原确实醒来了。
    在乌珠穆沁草原深处的白音胡布尔苏木（乡），记者访问了蒙古族牧民伊达木。这位勇冠草原的摔跤手如今是遐迩闻名的商品生产模范，6年前他家的牲畜总共只有300头，现在1年出栏的牲畜就达400多头。伊达木告诉记者：“过去我是满足于‘卖皮卖毛卖肉、够吃够穿够用’生活的‘老’牧民，现在我成了发展商品生产的‘新’牧民。1983年牧区改革以来，我先后盖起500多平方米的棚圈，打了两眼井，围建了1万多亩草库伦，购置了汽车、拖拉机、打草机和搂草机，彻底改变了过去的生产和生活方式。到今年，我家的牲畜发展到2000多头，毛绒皮张的产量和出栏牲畜比6年前提高了5到10倍多，纯收入也从2000多元猛增到7万多元。”
    朝伦巴特尔介绍说，改革以来，像伊达木这样的先进牧民在乌珠穆沁草原上成批涌现。在他们的带动下，东乌旗数万牧民摆脱了“逐水草而牧”的落后生产方式，走上了定居轮牧、发展商品经济的道路。今年，东乌旗存栏牲畜已由6年前的不足百万头发展到185万头，居内蒙古自治区100个旗县之首，成为国家和自治区重要的畜牧业商品基地。
    告别了伊达木，记者来到东乌旗旗府乌里雅斯太镇，眼前一派沸腾景象：毛纺厂车间机声轰鸣，肉联厂工地车水马龙，皮件厂的职工正在翻晒晾满大院的皮张，骨血粉厂的职工正在分理堆积如山的杂骨……数年前还是沉寂冷落的草原小镇，如今竟成了生机勃勃的工业新城。
    几位厂长告诉记者，过去单一的畜牧业经济曾使乌珠穆沁草原吃了大亏：解放后到1978年的30年间，东乌旗总计将282万张牛羊皮和25万吨绒毛做为原料廉价卖给外地，白白失去了数目可观的加工增值之利；500万头牲畜千里迢迢赶到外地出售，仅途中掉膘就损失肉达3.5万吨，减少收入1.5亿元。这两笔帐使人们警醒过来了：要振兴乌珠穆沁草原，还必须大力发展畜产品加工工业，彻底改变自然经济旧格局。
    草原上办工业，最大的困难是缺技术、缺人才。为了解决这些困难，1984年以来，分管工业的副旗长刘宝明带领有关人员四处奔波，先后从区内外聘请了300多名专家、学者和技术人员，帮助旗里进行工业开发的考察论证和规划设计，指导工厂的施工、生产和经营管理。同时，旗里先后选派了200多人到外地学习有关生产技术和管理知识，建立起自己的技术骨干队伍。
    短短6年时间，东乌旗新建了毛纺织厂、牛羊肉联合加工厂、马肉加工厂和骨血粉厂，改造扩建了皮件厂和乳品厂，形成了包括毛、绒、皮、肉、乳、骨、血和内脏在内的畜产品加工工业体系，产品畅销区内外，经济效益显著增长，去年工业总产值达到3314万元，比这些工厂创办前增长了8倍。刘宝明说得好：“乌珠穆沁草原单纯生产和输出畜产原料的历史已经结束了，古老的草原从此进入了牧工有机结合、互相促进、协调发展的商品生产新阶段。”
