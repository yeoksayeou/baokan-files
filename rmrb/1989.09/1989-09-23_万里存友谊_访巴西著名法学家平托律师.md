Everlasting Friendship
— An Interview with Renowned Brazilian Lawyer Sobral Pinto

By Lan Caiji, People's Daily Reporter

Brazilian renowned legal scholar and old friend of the Chinese people, Sobral Pinto, is 96 years old. This lawyer, who has dedicated his life to defending the poor and upholding justice, has worked in the legal field for over 70 years. He is highly respected and honored not only in Brazil but also on the international legal stage. He is also deeply admired and respected by the Chinese people.

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our reporter specially traveled to Rio de Janeiro to interview this legal scholar. He harbors deep affection for China and the Chinese people, and his noble character is truly inspiring.

Pinto has served as the president of the Brazilian Bar Association and a member of the World Lawyers Association. Although he is now in his nineties, he still goes to his law firm every day. His office is located on the third floor of a public building in the bustling city center, consisting of two ordinary rooms. Apart from books, documents, and daily office supplies, there are no other furnishings. Upon the reporter's arrival, the elderly lawyer put down his work and happily engaged in conversation. He was spirited, with a keen gaze, clear thinking, and articulate speech. Facing this venerable lawyer, my mind drifted back 25 years to the shocking "Nine-Person Incident"...

In 1964, a coup occurred in Brazil. Nine Chinese personnel, who were engaged in trade, preparing for an economic and trade exhibition, and conducting news reporting in Brazil at that time, were illegally arrested and subjected to torture and persecution by the coup authorities. Just as the nine Chinese people were in dire straits, Pinto, who was already in his seventies, vigorously advocated for justice, tirelessly appealed, and bravely took up their defense in court, striving to maintain the friendship between the Chinese and Brazilian peoples. Under international pressure and through Pinto's efforts, the relevant authorities were forced to release the innocent, and the nine Chinese personnel finally returned to the embrace of their motherland.

The old lawyer also told the reporter that he did not charge a single cent for helping the Chinese people with this case, although every case requires money, he used his limited income to cover every expense. Speaking of this, the old lawyer took out a letter of credit signed by Wang Yaoting and the other eight Chinese people at that time, explaining that with this letter of credit, he could at any time withdraw from the Brazilian banks that have business dealings with the Bank of China all the funds needed for the case. However, in the eyes of this old lawyer, justice and friendship are more precious than material wealth and money. After the case was settled, he never withdrew a single cent from the bank, and this letter of credit signed by the nine people has been cherished and kept in his law firm for 25 years! The contribution Pinto made to Sino-Brazilian friendship has always been remembered by the Chinese people.

Over the past 25 years, through the joint efforts of the two peoples, the friendly relations between China and Brazil have continued to develop. In August 1974, China and Brazil formally established diplomatic relations. Since then, the development of relations between the two countries has been rapid, with successive agreements on government trade, maritime transport, science and technology, peaceful use of nuclear energy, and cultural and educational cooperation, paving the way for further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.

When talking about friendship, the old lawyer became very emotional. He said, "25 years ago, I only did what I should have done, but the Chinese people have never forgotten their old friends. Since 1974, when the two countries established diplomatic relations, every Chinese ambassador who came to Brazil visited me, and when they left their posts, they also came to say goodbye to me. Many Brazilians who returned from visiting China also often brought me greetings and gifts from Chinese friends, which makes me very grateful."

As an old friend of the Chinese people, Pinto often reads books and magazines about China, pays attention to China's development, and is happy about every achievement and progress made by China, while also sharing the worries about some difficulties China encounters. He said with deep emotion, "China has become a part of my life."

The government of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, to commend Pinto's long-term work in the judiciary and his great contributions to society, appointed him as an honorary consultant of the Bar Association and allocated a large sum of retirement benefits. Pinto accepted this appointment but refused the government's allocation, continuing to live a frugal life.

    万里存友谊
    ——访巴西著名法学家平托律师
    本报记者　兰才基
    巴西著名法学家、中国人民的老朋友索布拉尔·平托律师已届96岁高龄。这位专门替穷人打官司、以伸张正义为己任、在法学界工作了70多年的老律师，不仅在巴西，而且在国际法坛上享有很高的荣誉和声望，同时也深得中国人民的钦佩和敬仰。
    在中华人民共和国建国40周年前夕，记者专程前往里约热内卢采访了这位法学博士。他对中国和中国人民怀有深厚的情谊，高风亮节，使人深受感动。
    平托律师担任过巴西律师学会主席和世界律师协会成员。现虽已至耄耋之年，但他每天仍坚持到律师事务所工作。他的律师事务所设在闹市区的一幢公共大楼第三层，两间普普通通的套房，除了书籍资料和日常办公用物之外，没有其它的陈设。记者来到这里，老律师撂下手头的工作高兴地攀谈起来。他精神矍铄，目光炯炯，思维严谨，话语清晰。面对着这位年高德劭的律师，我的脑际浮现出25年前发生的震惊中外的“9人事件”的情景……
    1964年，巴西发生了政变，中国当时在巴西进行贸易、筹备经贸展览和从事新闻报道的9名工作人员，遭到政变当局的无理逮捕，并受到虐待和迫害。就在9名中国人处于危难的时刻，当时已年逾七旬的平托律师全力伸张正义，四处奔走呼吁，并毅然为他们出庭辩护，为维护中巴人民的友谊而努力。在国际舆论的压力下，通过平托律师的多方努力，迫使有关当局不得不释放无辜者，9名中国人员终于回到了祖国的怀抱。
    老律师还告诉记者，他帮助中国人打这场官司是一分钱也不收的，尽管每办一件事都要花钱，但他都以自己有限的收入去垫付每一笔用款。谈到这里，老律师拿出了一张当年由王耀庭等9名中国人签字的信用委托书，说明凭着这张委托书，他随时可以到同中国银行有业务联系的巴西银行提取在办案中所需要的一切用款。然而，在这位老律师的眼里，正义和友谊比物质和金钱都宝贵，官司打完了，他始终未向银行提取过一文钱，而这张由9人签字的委托书却一直被珍惜地保存在他的律师事务所，到现在已经保存了25年！平托律师对中巴友谊所作的贡献也一直留存在中国人民心里。
    25年来，由于两国人民的共同努力，中巴两国的友好关系不断发展。1974年8月，中巴两国正式建立了外交关系。此后，两国关系的发展较快，先后签订了政府贸易、海运、科技、和平利用核能、文化教育合作等协定，为两国进一步发展友好合作开辟了广阔的道路。
    谈到友谊，老律师十分激动，他说：“25年前，我只是做了自己应该做的一点事，而中国人民从来没有忘记老朋友，自从1974年两国建交以来，每任中国大使来到巴西都来看我，离任时又向我辞行，许多访华归来的巴西人也经常给我带来中国朋友的问候和礼品，这使我非常感激。”
    作为中国人民的老朋友，平托律师还经常阅读有关中国的书刊，关注着中国的发展，为中国所取得的每一项成就和进步感到高兴，同时也为中国所遇到的一些困难分担忧虑。他深情地说，“中国已经成为我生活的一部分”。
    巴西里约热内卢州政府为了推崇平托律师多年从事司法工作和为社会作出的巨大贡献，委任他为律师协会的名誉顾问，并拨给他一笔巨额退休金。平托律师欣然接受了这一委任，但同时又拒绝了政府给他的拨款，继续过着自己俭朴的日子。
