	Is this the "End of the Earth and the Corner of the Sea"?
	People and vehicles flow. Wide roads stretch comfortably along the river and through the city. Newly built hotels, large hotels, commercial and financial buildings, factories, electronic and food industry zones, commercial and financial zones, residential areas, and tourist areas are all neatly arranged. All of this makes one feel as if they are in a big city, even doubting whether this is Sanya. But when you see the rows of swaying palm trees, the colorful tropical fruits everywhere, and especially feel the scorching sun, you will realize that you have truly arrived at the "End of the Earth and the Corner of the Sea."

	The reporters visited several famous scenic spots in Sanya: the rugged rocks and crashing waves of the "End of the Earth and the Corner of the Sea," the white sand and calm waves of the Dà Dōng Hǎi beach, and the mysterious village of Lù Huí Tóu. Each place is more enchanting than the last. But the most unforgettable is the deep blue water of Yá Lóng Wān. In that sea, which is both powerful and rich, you will be captivated, you will tremble, and you will experience the true essence of the ocean. Sunlight, seawater, beaches, greenery, and air—here, all the "five essential elements" for tourism are present.

	In July 1988, the "Sanya City Comprehensive Urban Planning" was released. Following that, a "Sanya Scenic Tourist Area Divisional Planning" focusing on 10 major scenic resources and 110 scenic spots in the southern part of the island was presented to the public with its novel and bold ideas.

	Goal: To build Sanya into a modern international coastal tourist city.

	Currently, Sanya is rapidly advancing towards this goal:
	—The main roads have been widened and extended, the Hé Xī Highway has been completed, and new bridges span the Sanya River;
	—240 international direct dialing telephone lines and 3,000 local telephone lines have been opened;
	—The advanced Hainan power supply has made power shortages in Sanya a thing of the past;
	—The second phase of the water supply project will be operational before the National Day this year, increasing the daily water supply by twofold compared to now;
	—Flights to Guangzhou five times a week and to Haikou three times a week have been operational, and passenger and cargo ships to Haikou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong have been put into service.

	In Sanya Bay and Lù Huí Tóu, and in the bustling city center, architectural groups from China, Spain, Italy, Australia, and other countries are rising. Currently, there are over 70 hotels of various types in the city, including 16 international hotels. In 1988, Sanya received 520,000 tourists, including 53,000 foreigners, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau.

	The "End of the Earth and the Corner of the Sea" is no longer desolate and remote; its natural beauty is gradually revealing itself. The thriving tourism industry will make this border city increasingly prosperous.

　　三亚，新兴的旅游城
　　（琼人　摄影  郑林明　邹永辉　撰文）
    这就是“天涯海角”吗？
    人流。车流。一条条宽阔的马路，沿河、过市，舒畅地伸展，一幢幢新建的宾馆、大酒店、商业金融大厦、厂房拔地而起，一片片初具规模的电子、食品工业区、商贸金融区、民用住宅区、旅游区排列有序。这一切使人恍若置身大都市，甚至怀疑这里是不是三亚了？但当你看见那一排排婆娑的椰树，那遍地五颜六色的热带瓜果，特别是感受到那灼人的阳光时，才感觉是真的到了天涯海角。
    记者游览了三亚几处著名的风景点：怪石嶙峋、惊涛拍岸的“天涯海角”，沙白浪平、澄碧见底的大东海浴场，富于神奇色彩的鹿回头村，一处比一处迷人。但最令人难忘的还是牙龙湾那湛蓝湛蓝的水。在那湾既有力度又丰腴的海水里，你会为之销魂，为之颤栗，会领略到大海的本色。阳光，海水，沙滩，绿色，空气，这里具备旅游的“五大要素”。
    1988年7月，《三亚市城市总体规划》出台。继而，一个以三亚为中心，聚集岛南10大风景资源、110个风景点的《三亚风景旅游区域分项规划》，以其新奇大胆的构思展现在人们面前。
    目标：把三亚建设成为一个现代化国际性的滨海旅游城市。
    如今，三亚正朝着这一目标快步前进：
    ——主街道已拓宽延长，河西公路建成，新桥飞架三亚河；
    ——240门国际长途直拨程控电话和3000门市内电话开通；
    ——超前发展的海南电力，使三亚缺电成为历史；
    ——第二期供水工程，今年国庆前投产后，日供水量将比现在增长两倍；
    ——一周五班直通广州和一周三班直通海口的飞机已通航，三亚至海口、广州、香港客货轮投入运行。
    在三亚湾、鹿回头，在繁华的市区，中国、西班牙、意大利、澳大利亚等各国风格的建筑群拔地而起。目前，全市各类宾馆已达70多家，其中涉外宾馆16家。1988年，三亚市接待游客52万人次，其中外国人、华侨、港澳同胞5.3万人次。
    天涯海角，不再荒凉僻远，她那天生丽质日渐显现出来。正在蓬勃发展的旅游业，将使这座边城日益繁荣。（附图片）
