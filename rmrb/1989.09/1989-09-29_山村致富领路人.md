In Hebei Province's Lingshou County, when people mention the demobilized soldier Ma Yulian, they all praise him as the leading goose in the village's quest for prosperity.

In 1982, after completing his military service, Ma Yulian returned to the small mountain village that had raised him, a village still surrounded by barren hills. Having seen the world outside the mountains, Ma Yulian grew even more fond of his impoverished hometown with its barren hills and bitter well water.

The villagers also noticed that Ma Yulian had changed; he had become more talkative, and what he said was always novel and enticing. After serving in the army for three years, he had a belly full of new things. Over time, his influence grew. In March 1984, he was elected as the village party branch secretary.

Ma Yulian had changed, but the small mountain village was still stuck in the same old rut: most households still lived on two meals of potatoes and pickled vegetables a day, many families' beds were covered with just straw mats, and at night they slept under worn-out quilts. "Facing the yellow earth and the sky, seeking clothes and food on the barren hills" was a hard life!

People often say, "A new official in charge, three big moves." Ma Yulian only made "one move"—establishing a marble processing factory. This was a bold and wise move to develop local resources and change the face of poverty in his hometown. Ma Yulian believed that the villagers were poor because they relied on the mountains but did not know how to use them. In other words, they were starving while holding a pie! Ma Yulian's words stirred the half-believing villagers, making them so excited that they couldn't sleep.

Starting a factory was like a pipe dream for the mountain villagers who earned their living by tilling the soil. With nothing but empty hands, they started from scratch. But Ma Yulian turned the villagers' dream into reality. He sought help from all directions, raising over 60,000 yuan; he carried a bag of dry rations, seeking advice everywhere; he went to Beijing three times to invite technical guidance and led the villagers to overcome technical difficulties in marble slab cutting and polishing. By the end of 1984, a modern processing factory was put into production...

Today, the products of this factory have reached national standards and are popular in Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, and other cities. They have also entered international markets such as Thailand and Hong Kong, receiving praise from overseas users. Last year, the factory made a profit of 850,000 yuan, with an average income of 790 yuan per person. One in three households in the village is a millionaire household. Every family in the village has a television, every household has savings, and the village has been rated as a civilized village by the region for consecutive years. The villagers are overjoyed: the army has cultivated a leader for us to get rich. Ma Yulian himself has also been commended many times. Last year, the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district awarded him a third-class merit.

    山村致富领路人
    刘桂江  常剑波
    在河北省灵寿县，提起退伍军人马玉良，乡亲们都赞扬他是山村致富领头雁。
    一九八二年，马玉良服役期满，回到了生他养他、如今仍被秃山圈围着的小山村。此时，见过了山外精采世界的马玉良，却分外地爱起了土地贫瘠、井水苦涩的家乡。
    乡亲们也发觉马玉良变了，变得爱拉呱了，而且他讲的东西总是那么新奇、诱人。当了三年兵，他装了一肚子新鲜事。天长日久，耳濡目染，他的威信提高了。一九八四年三月，他当选为村党支部书记。
    马玉良变了，小山村却几乎还是在原地打转儿：大多数家庭仍是一天两顿土豆加咸菜的生活水平，好多人家炕上铺着光席子，夜里盖着破被子……“面朝黄土背朝天，荒山岭上求吃穿”的日子不好过呀！
    人常说，“新官上任三把火”。马玉良只点了“一把火”——筹办一个大理石加工厂。这是一个开发本地资源、扭转家乡贫穷面貌的大胆明智之举。马玉良认为，乡亲们穷就穷在靠山没有吃山，确切地说，是靠山不会吃山，守着馅饼挨饿！马玉良的高论让半信半疑的乡亲们激动得睡不着觉。
    办工厂对土里刨食的山里人来讲，无异于痴人说梦。一穷二白，空手起家。而马玉良硬是把乡亲们的梦想变成了事实。他八方求援，凑了六万余元资金；他背着干粮袋，四处取经；他三上京城请来技术指导、带着乡亲们攻克了大理石板切割、刨光等技术难关。一九八四年底，一个现代化的加工厂投产了……
    而今，这个加工厂的产品达到了国家标准，畅销北京、天津、西安等市，还打入了泰国、香港等国际市场，受到国外用户的好评。去年，该厂赢利八十五万元，人均收入七百九十元，万元户占全村的三分之一还多。全村家家有了电视，户户都有存款，连年被地区评为文明村。乡亲们乐得合不拢嘴：部队给咱培养了一个致富带头人。马玉良本人也多次受到表彰，去年，石家庄军分区为他记了三等功。
