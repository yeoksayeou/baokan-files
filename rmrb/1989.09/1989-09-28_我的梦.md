My Dream
Jiangsu Dantu County, Jizhuang, Zhái Huáqīng

A person's dreams in a lifetime are like the stars in the sky, countless. They say that "daytime thoughts" lead to "nighttime dreams," but over these 40 years, there have been so many things that I dared not even dream of, yet I encountered them.

At the end of last year, this "old farmer" actually sat in the bright People's Great Hall, participating in the first National Star Fire Award ceremony. Wasn't this a dream? At that time, I rubbed my eyes hard, they were sore... Ah, it wasn't a dream. The state leaders Li Peng, Tian Jiyun, Zhou Guocheng, and Song Jian were sitting on the stage, and the medal in my hand clearly read "National Star Fire Demonstration Enterprise." I stroked the medal, and finally, like a child, I lowered my head, and tears streamed down my face...

I was born on the banks of the Yangtze River in the southern countryside. Before liberation, I worked as an apprentice in a cloth store in Suzhou and was bullied by the boss. In 1948, I lost my job, and my family's life became even more miserable. At that time, if I dreamed of a full meal, it would be a great joy.

One night in April 1949, I dreamed of the sun being especially large and bright. Later, a series of gunshots woke me up. I went out and saw the river surface glowing with fire. The People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yangtze! I never dreamed that the world would change so suddenly, and the poor would rise up. I danced the dragon lantern dance with my fellow villagers, and I was so happy that I couldn't sleep for several nights. Party, I, this peasant who has risen, will follow you for life!

I worked day and night, becoming the leader of a mutual aid group, the head of a primary cooperative, and the director of an advanced cooperative. My stomach was full, and my body was warm, so I started dreaming of farmers running factories. In 1957, I found more than a dozen shoemakers from before liberation, turned an old cow shed into a factory, and started the first shoe factory in the county—Jizhuang Shoe Factory. The next year, the factory was blown seven or eight kilometers away to Dahuang Town by a "communist wind" and became a commune-run factory. I was not willing to give up, so I recruited soldiers and reopened the Jizhuang Shoe Factory sign. In 1964, the factory was labeled as taking the capitalist road and was ordered to close. If a person has any ideas, they are truly "stubborn." I was not convinced, and I hung a big iron lock on the factory gate, letting the workers secretly make shoes in the workshop. The workers whispered to me, "Old Zhao, let's not dream anymore, paper can't cover fire." I thought about it and agreed. How could so many workers "hide" in the factory making shoes and not be found out? So, I went to the higher-ups to "kowtow." Later, the county's supervising bureau investigated left and right and found no crooked paths, so they agreed to resume production at the shoe factory.

During the chaotic "Cultural Revolution," I played the "old trick" again: at night, leather was secretly brought into the factory, and before dawn, the shoes were secretly transported out of the village. But soon, my "utopia" dream was shattered. I was suspended from my job for inspection. The rebels banged on the table and pointed at my nose: "Zhao Huacheng, you let everyone wear such beautiful leather shoes, dreaming of taking the capitalist road and promoting revisionism." I gritted my teeth and said nothing. But my heart was bleeding!

The spring breeze turned green again on the southern bank of the Yangtze. In 1978, the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee was held. I never dreamed that in the "year of destiny," I would witness a prosperous age. Thanks to the Party's good policies, farmers dared to think what they had never dared to think, dared to do what they had never dared to do, and the "dream" of a good life became more and more daring; and as they dreamed, many things that seemed like dreams, or even dreams they dared not dream, one by one became a reality. Although my temples are white, I feel more youthful. The various types of shoes we produce are not only popular domestically but are also exported to 24 countries and regions around the world. Our factory became a provincial foreign trade designated factory—the only village-run factory in the province that exports leather shoes. The factory's sign was treasured by everyone like their eyes. In the autumn of 1984, the shoe factory signed a contract with the United States for 180,000 pairs of craft shoes. Due to the tight schedule, heavy tasks, and frequent power outages, normal production was affected, and the delivery period was in jeopardy. At night, the workers lit candles in the workshop waiting for the power to come back on. When the power came, they worked all night. On New Year's Day, a newlywed couple also brought their lunch boxes to work on time with the workers. In the end, the factory delivered the goods two days ahead of schedule, and the American boss kept saying "OK."

One day, I heard from a phone call that a engineer in Shanghai had designed a soybean milk machine that separates pulp and residue and was preparing to sell the blueprints. I immediately sent someone to investigate the market and then went to Shanghai to buy the blueprints, organizing technical forces to tackle the problem. After 9 months of hard work and 77 experiments, the soybean milk machine that separates pulp and residue was finally developed. The shoe factory immediately invested 400,000 yuan to build a subsidiary, unveiling the sign of Dantu County Food Machinery Factory No. 3. Later, we developed 6 types of Shengwei brand soybean milk machines and the domestically first Double Dragon brand home food pulping and grinding machine. Now "Double Dragon" has obtained national patent rights, and "Double Dragon" and "Shengwei" have both won the National Science and Technology Commission Star Fire Plan Gold Award; Jizhuang Shoe Factory has been rated as a provincial star enterprise; the shoe factory and Dantu County Food Machinery Factory No. 3 have an annual output value of over 10 million yuan; I have also been rated as a provincial township enterprise entrepreneur.

Last year, after the award ceremony in Beijing ended, I walked out of the venue holding the heavy medal. I remember that Tiananmen Square was lit up like daytime. I stood on the white marble steps, looked up at the national emblem on top of the Great Hall, and suddenly thought of the dream 40 years ago, the sun in the dream that was so big and bright. This sun, isn't it our great socialist motherland!

I am already 63 years old, but I still have so many dreams...

### 我的梦

    我的梦
    江苏丹徒县纪庄　翟华清
    人一生一世做的梦，就像天上星星，数不清。都说“日有所思”才“夜有所梦”，可是这40年来，有多少梦都不敢梦的事，却叫我给遇上了。
    去年年底，我这个“老庄稼”，竟然坐在亮堂堂的人民大会堂里，参加首届国家星火奖授奖大会。这不是做梦？当时我使劲揉了揉眼睛，酸酸的……呵，不是梦。主席台上正坐着李鹏、田纪云、周谷城、宋健等国家领导人，手中奖牌清清楚楚地写着“国家星火示范企业”，我抚摸着奖牌，终于像孩子一样，头一低，眼泪哗哗地顺脸淌……
    我生在长江岸边的江南农村。解放前在苏州一家布店当学徒，受尽老板欺侮。1948年失业，一家人日子更惨了。那时要是梦见一顿饱饭，就是好大的快活哟。
    1949年4月一天夜里，我梦见太阳特别大、特别亮。后来一阵阵枪炮声把我惊醒，出门一看，只见江面上火光闪耀。人民解放军打过长江啦！做梦也没想到，天地一下子变了个样，穷人一下子翻了个身。我和乡亲们一道扭起了秧歌舞，高兴得一连几个晚上睡不着觉。党呵，我这个翻身农民要跟着您干一辈子！
    我没日没夜地工作，当上了互助组长、初级社社长、高级社主任。肚子吃饱了，身上穿暖了，我又做开了种田人办厂的梦。1957年，我找了十几个解放前做过皮鞋的师傅，把破旧的牛棚改做厂房，办起了全县第一家皮鞋厂——纪庄鞋厂。第二年，鞋厂被一阵“共产风”刮到七八公里外的大港镇，成了社办厂。我不甘心，又招兵买马，重新挂起纪庄鞋厂的牌子。1964年，鞋厂又被定为走资本主义道路的典型，勒令关门。人要是有个什么想头，也真是“顽固”。我心里不服，在厂大门上挂着一把大铁锁，让工人在车间里偷着做鞋。工人悄悄地对我说：“老翟呀，我们别再做梦啦，纸是包不住火的啊！”我想想也对，这么多工人“躲”在厂里做鞋子，能瞒得长吗？于是，我便到上面去“叩头”，后来，县主管局左查右查，实在没有查出什么歪门邪道，才同意恢复鞋厂生产。
      “文革”大乱时，我又玩起“老一套”：夜里皮料偷偷进厂，天不亮把皮鞋偷运出村。可是没多久，我的“世外桃源”梦破灭了。我被停职检查。造反派拍着桌子，手指我鼻子：“你翟华清让大家穿这么漂亮的皮鞋，就是梦想走资本主义道路、搞修正主义。”我咬咬牙，不作声。可心里在流血呀！
    春风又绿江南岸。1978年，党的十一届三中全会召开了。我做梦也没有想到，“天命”之年欣逢盛世。凭着党的好政策，种田人不敢想的想了，不敢干的干了，过好日子的“美梦”越做越多、越做越敢做；而做着做着，那好多看看是梦，甚至梦都不敢梦的东西，一个一个变到眼前来。我虽然双鬓斑白，却觉得更年轻了。我们生产的各种皮鞋不仅畅销国内，还远销世界24个国家和地区。我们厂成了省外贸定点厂——全省唯一出口皮鞋的村办厂。工厂的牌子，大家拿它当眼睛一样宝贝。1984年秋，鞋厂和美国签订了18万双工艺布鞋的合同。由于时间紧、任务重，又经常停电，不能正常生产，眼看要影响交货期。晚上工人们点起蜡烛在车间等电，电来了，一干就是通宵。大年初一，一对新婚的青年夫妇也和工人们一道提着饭盒按时上班。最后，鞋厂提前两天交货，美国老板连声叫“OK”。
    有一天，我从一个电话里听说上海有一位工程师设计了浆、渣自分离豆浆机的图纸并准备转卖，便火速派人调查市场，随后到上海买下图纸，组织技术力量攻关。经过9个月的苦战，77次试验，浆、渣自分离豆浆机终于研制成功了。鞋厂马上投资40万元，建立分厂，亮出了丹徒县食品机械三厂的牌子。后来，我们又开发出6种型号的神威牌系列豆浆机和属国内首创的双龙牌家用食品制浆制粉机。现在“双龙”获得了国家专利权，“双龙”、“神威”双双荣获了国家科委星火计划金奖；纪庄鞋厂被评为省级明星企业；鞋厂和县食品机械三厂年产值已达1000万元以上；我也被评为省乡镇企业家。
    去年北京的授奖大会结束时，我捧着沉甸甸的奖牌走出会场。记得天安门广场一片灯光，像白天一样亮。我站在汉白玉台阶上，抬头望着大会堂门顶上的共和国国徽，突然想起40年前的那个梦，梦中那个又大又亮的太阳。这太阳，不就是我们伟大的社会主义祖国吗！
    我已经63岁了，但我还有好多好多梦哩……
