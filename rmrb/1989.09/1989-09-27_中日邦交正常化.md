New China Forty Years of Diplomatic Achievements

    Normalization of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations
    In the new situation following China's restoration of its lawful seat in the United Nations and U.S. President Nixon's visit to China, Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who took office in July 1972, expressed in his first cabinet meeting the intention to expedite the normalization of diplomatic relations with China. Premier Zhou Enlai immediately welcomed this. On September 25, 1972, Prime Minister Tanaka visited China, met with Chairman Mao Zedong, and held several talks with Premier Zhou Enlai. Through the joint efforts of both sides, the leaders of the two governments signed the "Joint Communiqué of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Japan" on September 29, announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries starting from that day, thus ending the abnormal state between the two countries and achieving the normalization of diplomatic relations.

    In August 1978, the foreign ministers of China and Japan signed the "Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China" in Beijing. In October of the same year, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government, and the two countries exchanged the instruments of ratification of the "Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China" in Tokyo. Thereafter, the two sides have continued to remove obstacles, promoting the development of political, economic, scientific, technological, and cultural relations between the two countries with greater strides.

    Since the 1950s, China has actively engaged in people-to-people diplomacy with Japan, creating conditions for the eventual normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries. On June 1, 1952, the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement was signed. In March 1953, China assisted overseas Chinese in Japan to return to their homeland. In October 1954, a large delegation from the Chinese Red Cross visited Japan. In June 1956, China announced the lenient treatment of Japanese war criminals. In 1958, China proposed the three political principles and three trade principles for handling relations between the two countries, guiding the gradual and cumulative development of economic, political, and cultural relations between China and Japan, and promoting mutual influence and advancement. In 1964, China and Japan established reciprocal trade offices and dispatched permanent correspondents. Through long-term efforts, people-to-people diplomacy finally pushed for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

    中日邦交正常化
    在联合国恢复中国合法席位和美国总统尼克松访华的新形势下，1972年7月就任的日本首相田中角荣，在首次内阁会议上即表示要加紧实现同中国邦交正常化。周恩来总理随即表示欢迎。1972年9月25日，田中首相来华访问，会见了毛泽东主席，同周恩来总理举行了多次会谈。经过双方的共同努力，两国政府首脑9月29日签署了《中华人民共和国政府、日本国政府联合声明》，宣布即日起中日建立外交关系，从而结束两国间不正常状态，实现了邦交正常化。
    1978年8月，中日两国外长在北京签署了《中日和平友好条约》。同年10月，邓小平副总理应邀访日，两国在东京交换了《中日和平友好条约》的批准书。其后，中日双方不断排除干扰，使两国在政治、经济、科技、文化等领域的关系以更大的步伐向前发展。
    从50年代起中国主动开展的中日民间外交，为后来两国实现邦交正常化创造了条件。1952年6月1日签署了第一个中日民间贸易协定。1953年3月，中国协助旅日华侨回国。1954年10月，中国红十字会大型代表团访问日本。1956年6月，中国宣布宽大处理日本战犯。1958年中国相继提出了处理两国关系的政治三原则和贸易三原则，指导中日两国以渐进和积累的方式发展经济、政治和文化关系，并使之互相影响和促进。1964年，中日实现互设备忘录贸易机构和互派常驻记者。经过长期努力，民间外交终于推动了中日关系正常化的实现。
