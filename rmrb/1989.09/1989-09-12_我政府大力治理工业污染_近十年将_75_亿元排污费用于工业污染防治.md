The Chinese government is actively addressing industrial pollution. In the past decade, 7.5 billion yuan in sewage fees have been allocated for industrial pollution control.

Industrial production is the primary cause of environmental pollution and ecological damage in China. According to statistics, industrial production accounts for more than 70% of the total pollution discharge in the country. China's environmental protection efforts have consistently prioritized industrial pollution control, achieving significant results. In 1988, compared to 1981, industrial output increased by 1.34 times, while industrial wastewater discharge increased by only 15%. The amount of wastewater discharged per 10,000 yuan of industrial output decreased from 450 tons to 221 tons, and the discharge of heavy metals in wastewater decreased by 64%. Coal consumption increased by 58%, but sulfur dioxide emissions increased by only 11%, and dust emissions decreased by 1.2%. The amount of industrial solid waste generated per 10,000 yuan of industrial output decreased from 7.27 tons to 4.63 tons.

The main measures for industrial pollution control in China include:

Through technological transformation, eliminating "three wastes" (wastewater, waste gas, and solid waste) during the production process. The refineries of China Petrochemical Corporation changed the cooling of distillation top gas from "direct cooling" to "intermediate cooling - dry and wet air cooling," reducing the annual discharge of oily wastewater by nearly 100 million tons. The chemical industry changed the mercury method to the ion membrane method for soda production, eliminating mercury pollution from soda production.

Rational production layout and industrial structure adjustment. From 1981 to 1988, more than 14,000 enterprises with high energy consumption and severe pollution were closed, stopped, merged, transformed, or relocated nationwide. Industries such as electroplating, forging, and heat treatment were reorganized, and a number of cooperative centers were established. In the machinery sector alone, during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, more than 7,600 electroplating and heat treatment production points were closed.

Promoting comprehensive utilization and achieving resource utilization of industrial "three wastes." The product value and profit from the comprehensive utilization of "three wastes" have significantly increased (see the figure below). This not only improves resource utilization but also eliminates pollution, achieving significant economic and environmental benefits.

Strengthening the treatment of "three wastes" and improving the treatment level. In the past decade, China's treatment level of "three wastes" has significantly improved. From 1981 to 1988, a total of 220,000 treatment projects were arranged and constructed, with the majority completed and put into operation. The industrial wastewater treatment rate increased from 13% in 1981 to 27% in 1988, with a total treatment volume of 7.23 billion tons. The transformation rate of boilers and industrial furnaces increased from 33% and 19% in 1981 to 65% and 41% in 1988, respectively. The recovery amount of industrial dust increased from 63.6 million tons in 1981 to 186.1 million tons in 1988.

Strengthening enterprise environmental management and promoting pollution control. In 1988, the "three simultaneities" (simultaneous design, construction, and operation of pollution control facilities) implementation rate for large and medium-sized enterprises reached 96%. The 261 key pollution control projects identified by the state in 1978 have all been completed. Since the implementation of the pollution discharge fee in 1979, a total of 7.5 billion yuan has been collected, promoting pollution control. The enterprise environmental responsibility system and the creation of "clean and civilized factories" and "environmentally friendly factories" have driven the in-depth development of enterprise environmental protection work.

　　我政府大力治理工业污染
　  近十年将75亿元排污费用于工业污染防治
　　王扬祖　过孝民
    工业生产是造成我国环境污染和生态破坏的主要原因。据统计，目前工业生产排放的污染物占全国污染物总排放量的70％以上。我国环保工作始终把工业污染防治列为一项重要任务，取得了显著的成绩。1988年与1981年相比，工业产值增长1.34倍，而工业废水排放量仅增加15％，万元产值工业废水排放量从450吨下降到221吨，废水中的重金属排放量减少64％；原煤消耗量增长了58％，而二氧化硫排放量仅增加11％，烟尘排放量减少了1.2％，万元产值工业固体废物产生量从7.27吨下降到4.63吨。
    我国工业污染防治的措施主要有：
    通过技术改造，把“三废”消除在生产过程之中。中国石油化学总公司炼油企业将减压蒸馏顶气冷却由“直冷”改为“间冷——干湿式空冷”，每年少排放含油废水近1亿吨；化学工业制碱生产将汞法改为离子膜法，消除了制碱生产的汞污染。
    合理生产布局，调整产业结构。1981——1988年全国已有14000多家能耗高、污染严重的企业实行了关、停、并、转、迁。对电镀、锻铸、热处理等行业进行了改组，建立了一批事业协作中心，仅机械部门，“六五”期间就撤消电镀、热处理生产点7600多个。
    大力开展综合利用，实现工业“三废”资源化。“三废”综合利用的产品产值和利润大幅度提高（见下图）。不仅提高了资源利用率，而且消除了污染，获得了显著的经济效益和环境效益。
    加强“三废”处理，提高“三废”处理水平。近十几年来，我国的“三废”处理水平有了较大的提高。1981年到1988年共安排建设处理项目22万余个，其中绝大部分已竣工投入运行。工业废水处理率1981年为13％，1988年提高到27％，工业废水处理量已达72.3亿吨；锅炉和工业炉窑改造率1981年分别为33％和19％，1988年提高到65％和41％；工业粉尘回收量由1981年的636万吨增加到1988年的1861万吨。
    强化企业环境管理，以管促治。1988年大中型企业“三同时”执行率已达96％，1978年国家确定的第一批261个污染限期治理项目已全部完成。自1979年执行排污收费以来累计收费已达75亿元，促进了污染的防治。企业环境目标责任制和创建“清洁文明工厂”、“环境优美工厂”的活动，推动企业环保工作的深入进行。（附图片）
