The great victory in suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion brings genuine joy to the Party's news workers, but it also makes us keenly aware of the harm caused by incorrect public opinion guidance. As we regain a stable and united situation, for the future of the news industry, we must reflect deeply on the past and explore the ideological and theoretical reasons behind the formation of incorrect public opinion guidance.

	(I)
The bias in news reporting began as soon as the student movement started. Some news reports, while affirming the patriotic enthusiasm of the majority of students, did not point out the obvious signs of turmoil. The most obvious error in public opinion guidance began with the emphasis on promoting the speech given by Comrade Zhao Ziyang to the Asian Development Bank delegation on May 4. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech, delivered in a sudden and unexpected manner, negated the judgment of the "April 26" editorial by the People's Daily on the turmoil, effectively indicating to the masses that there were two different voices within the Central Committee regarding this turmoil. Following this, on May 6, Comrade Zhao Ziyang met with the responsible comrades in charge of propaganda work in the Central Committee, stating that news freedom was a focal point at the moment. He affirmed that the previous reporting on the student movement had been somewhat open, that marches had been reported, and that increasing the degree of news openness a bit seemed to pose little risk. His policy of further liberalization, combined with his linking of the already formed turmoil with international anti-socialist currents, describing it as an "international progressive tide" and "the will of the people," was clearly a mobilization of the news and public opinion community to support the turmoil.

In the face of differing voices within the Central Committee's leadership, some of our news workers were unable to discern clearly, and the errors in public opinion guidance became increasingly apparent. For a period, the escalating marches, sit-ins, and hunger strikes were reported in a one-sided and exaggerated manner; a small number of "turmoil elites" openly appeared in news reports, with figures like Shen Jianchi, Bao Zhenxin, and Su Xiaokang's "urgent appeals" and the "May 16 Declaration" being published in some newspapers. These reports, which deviated from the Central Committee's correct decisions, were completely dominated by incorrect stances and extreme emotions, and were not the "objective, fair," and "truth-telling" reporting that some people claimed.

On May 19, the Central Committee convened a meeting of Party, government, and military cadres in the capital, announcing the decision to take further decisive measures to suppress the turmoil, and on May 20, Premier Li Peng issued the order to impose martial law in parts of the capital. By this point, the struggle within the Central Committee's leadership had become clear, and the fact that Comrade Zhao Ziyang supported the turmoil and split the Party had been exposed. Even under these circumstances, some news and public opinion outlets passively responded to the Central Committee's correct decisions, and even used various means to propagate voices opposing the Central Committee's decisions, creating an atmosphere of opposition to martial law. For example, they reported international news with headlines such as "Prime Minister ××× says military force should not be used to resolve domestic issues," using subtle hints. Some also used "spring and autumn pen techniques," writing "marginal news," and expressing their views and emotions in a hidden and indirect manner. Reports such as "The ×th Day of Martial Law in Beijing," "A Glimpse of Tiananmen Square," "The Public Morality of Today's Beijing People," and "A Night in Beijing" portrayed the city of Beijing, which was in a state of severe disorder due to the actions of a few people, as a peaceful world with orderly social order and elevated morality; they portrayed the situation where some people trampled Tiananmen Square, preventing children from celebrating the holiday, as a festive scene of university students and children celebrating together on Tiananmen Square; they portrayed the just struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion as a scene of tragedy and terror.

The incorrect guidance of news and public opinion had extremely serious consequences, playing a role in inciting the turmoil aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subverting the People's Republic of China, emboldening the reactionary spirit of a few turmoil plotters, confusing the thoughts of the broad masses, and preventing people from correctly understanding the nature of the turmoil and correctly understanding the spirit of the Central Committee. Moreover, it played a detrimental role in the spread of the turmoil throughout the country.

	(II)
The errors in news and public opinion guidance were rooted in Comrade Zhao Ziyang's serious mistakes, but under the same circumstances, the public opinion expressions were different. This indicates that we still need to look for reasons within the news team and from the news guidance ideology.

Bourgeois liberalization in the news field has two prominent manifestations: one is to separate and oppose "popularity" and party spirit; the other is to advocate abstract news freedom, which is essentially bourgeois news freedom. These two aspects, although manifested differently, both result in the denial of the party spirit principle in news work, the denial of the Party's leadership over news work, and thus the change in the correct political direction of news work.

Regarding the issue of party spirit and "popularity" in news work, the earliest proposal was made by Hu Jiewei in 1979. At that time, the question raised was: Facts over the years have shown that our Party has made serious mistakes, and news work itself has also made serious mistakes. How can we prevent similar mistakes from happening again in the future? Therefore, it was believed that while emphasizing party spirit, we should also emphasize the "popularity" of news work. Hu Jiewei's views on party spirit and popularity, although revised several times, essentially held that the Party can make mistakes, but the people do not make mistakes. When the Party makes mistakes, news workers should stand on the side of the people, reflect the people's demands, and thus avoid making mistakes along with the Party. This basic idea was repeatedly expressed and had a broad impact in the news community.

Regarding the erroneous views on the issue of party spirit and popularity, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee that some people "oppose the Party's leadership with democracy and make un-Marxist statements on the issue of party spirit and popularity." This clearly revealed the essence of the problem. According to Marxism's views on the relationship between parties, classes, and the masses, the Party's leadership and people's democracy should be unified, and party spirit and popularity (here, this concept is only used to express that news should reflect the interests and demands of the people) should also be unified. We know that the people are divided into different classes, strata, and interest groups, and how their interests and demands are reflected is a complex issue. Only the Communist Party, armed with Marxism, serving the people wholeheartedly, and working for the interests of the broad masses, can represent the interests of the people. This is the basis for the unity of party spirit and popularity. Opposing the Party's leadership and people's democracy, opposing party spirit and popularity, assuming that the people can be separated from the Party and can correctly decide issues solely through the spontaneous actions of the masses, will only lead to the abandonment of the Party's leadership and fall into a state of anarchy. Some comrades who emphasize popularity precisely use "popularity" as a concept that party spirit cannot contain. It seems that emphasizing party spirit means only being responsible to the Party and not being responsible to the people at the same time; emphasizing the propaganda of the Party's proposals means not reflecting the people's demands at the same time. Therefore, they advocate that when the Party makes mistakes, popularity should be emphasized to "supplement" the shortcomings of party spirit. This view of separating popularity from party spirit inevitably leads to two situations: one is that the correctness of the Party's policies and resolutions is not judged through social practice and the collective of the Party, but by news workers, placing news workers in the position of the judge of truth; the other is that news workers, believing that the Party's policies and resolutions are correct, will propagate them, and believing that they are incorrect, will not propagate them, and even propagate voices contrary to the Party's decisions, believing that they are speaking for the people. Both situations can lead to an erroneous conclusion: the Party can make mistakes, but news workers will not make mistakes and can always correctly reflect the fundamental interests of the people. This is hard to imagine. Our news workers, even the best comrades, cannot guarantee that their judgments on the correctness of the Party's line are always correct, that their good opinions always represent the people. Moreover, the Party can make mistakes, and news workers can also make mistakes. If they deviate from the Party's leadership, they will make even greater mistakes. If news workers believe that the Party has made a mistake and do not execute the Party's decisions, and believe that they represent the people, the result will inevitably be to deviate from the Party's leadership and lead news and public opinion in the wrong direction. The errors in some public opinion guidance this time can be said to have occurred consciously or unconsciously under the influence of this erroneous ideology. Some comrades indeed believed that the Central Committee's judgment on the nature of the turmoil was incorrect, and the State Council's decision to impose martial law in parts of the capital was also incorrect. They wanted to insist on so-called "popularity" and reflect the voices of the people.

Hu Jiewei instructed the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to orchestrate the signing of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, saying: "Now everyone is disappointed with the Central Committee, disappointed with the government, and hopes for the National People's Congress." In fact, what they reflected as the voices of the people did not represent the majority of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. They only reflected the demands of a few turmoil makers and the temporary extreme emotions of some masses who were unaware of the truth, while the Central Committee's correct decisions truly reflected the fundamental and long-term interests of the people.

Upholding party spirit is the fundamental principle of the Party's news work. The party spirit of the Communist Party not only concentrates on the class interests of the proletariat but also reflects the fundamental interests of the people. Serving the people wholeheartedly and acting in the interests of the people, in news and public opinion work, correctly reflecting the wishes, voices, and demands of the people, and at the same time guiding the masses with Marxism-Leninism and the Party's line, principles, and policies, are all inherent in upholding the principle of party spirit. The principle of party spirit not only regulates the relationship between the Party's news industry and the Party but also regulates the relationship between the Party's news industry and the people, embodying the unity of news work being responsible to the Party and responsible to the people. The view that party spirit only talks about the relationship with the Party and popularity talks about the relationship with the people is wrong. Separating party spirit and popularity essentially advocates that popularity is above party spirit and that party spirit should be subordinate to popularity. The result can only be to weaken, shake, or even abolish the principle of party spirit, which also goes against the fundamental interests of the people.

	(III)
We see that a few turmoil plotters used abstract news freedom to incite some people in the news industry to support the turmoil. For example, when the *World Economic Herald* was punished for publishing an article demanding a reversal of the verdict on opposing bourgeois liberalization, Shen Jianchi, Bao Zhenxin, and Dai Qing wrote an open letter to the Shanghai Municipal Committee on April 28, with the slogan "Defending News Freedom." The errors in news and public opinion guidance were also influenced by this abstract news freedom.

News freedom, like other democratic freedoms, is concrete, not abstract; it is relative, not absolute. Different social systems have different news freedoms. There is no class-transcending, abstract news freedom. Discussing news freedom under socialist conditions cannot be separated from the socialist economic base, cannot be separated from the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses, and cannot be separated from the socialist nature and role of the news industry. In a socialist society, news freedom not only needs to comply with the constitution and laws but also needs to comply with necessary propaganda discipline and maintain social stability and unity. All of these are necessary to maintain the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses. At the same time, fundamentally, only under socialist conditions can there be the broadest and most developing news freedom.

It is worth noting that, as the turmoil continued to escalate, Hu Jiewei published the article "Without News Freedom, There Can Be No True Stability" in the *World Economic Herald* on May 8. This article, published after April 26, did not mention the nature of the turmoil or the fact that a few people were undermining democratic legal order and fundamentally negating the socialist system. Instead, it emphasized that without news freedom, there can be no stability and unity, believing that news freedom is fine as long as it does not violate the law. Within this limit, any article can be published, and any opinion can be expressed. What was the intention of this article? It is worth pondering.

The view that news work is fine as long as it does not violate the law is insufficient and cannot explain the reality of socialist news activities, nor can it explain the reality of capitalist news activities. Indeed, news activities cannot violate the law and must comply with the law, but this is only one aspect. There is another aspect: whether in a socialist society or a capitalist society, the constraints on news activities are not only legal means but also specific, real class interests and political demands. Take capitalist countries as an example: some news industries run by the government or political parties always maintain the interests of the government or political party and propagate the proposals of the government or political party, which is very obvious. Even numerous news media run by private conglomerates can criticize government officials and expose certain officials' scandals, but they never dare to touch the interests of their backers, nor do they dare to offend their advertisers, otherwise, they will immediately lose their jobs. Where is the full and universal news freedom? However, bourgeois ideologues always promote this freedom, which is determined by the wallet, as a universal form of freedom, as if their news freedom is abstract and class-transcending, and conceal their class essence. This is the hypocrisy of bourgeois news freedom. The reality of news in various countries is that due to different social systems, different historical traditions, and national conditions, the ways and means of regulating news activities will not be the same. In addition to using legal means to regulate (of course, laws also reflect a class will), other interests and political controls are also required. Whether it is socialism or capitalism, news and public opinion must serve certain class interests, and this is common. Abstract, class-transcending news freedom does not exist. Only talking about the relativity of news freedom, not talking about the class nature of news freedom, and blurring the different natures of news freedom under different social systems is a view that the bourgeoisie can also accept.

Hu Jiewei's views on news freedom influenced many people, causing them to become infatuated with abstract freedom and lose their way. If news freedom is practiced according to this view, it is impossible to have true social stability. News that violates the law will indeed affect social stability, but if propaganda discipline is not followed and the fundamental interests of the people are violated, social stability will also be affected. From some news practices and street actions during the turmoil, we can see what content is included in the news freedom advocated by some people? This is the freedom to oppose major decisions of the Central Committee, the freedom to arbitrarily reverse cases that the Central Committee has already concluded, the freedom to spread rumors, and even the freedom to insult Party and state leaders and incite the overthrow of the legal government. It is clear that if such news freedom is allowed to develop, it will be impossible to have a stable and united situation. Such news freedom is not socialist news freedom, but the news freedom advocated by the bourgeoisie.

News and public opinion must uphold the correct political direction, which is determined by the socialist nature and important role of news and public opinion tools. As a news and public opinion tool of the Party, it should become the ears, eyes, mouth, and throat of the Party, government, and people; its reports and statements must unconditionally propagate the Party's line, principles, policies, and political views, be conducive to social stability and unity, be conducive to the development of social productive forces, and be conducive to the improvement of the spiritual civilization of the people.

Emphasizing the upholding of the correct direction of news work is not to say that news does not need reform. It should be said that correcting the political direction and promoting news reform are unified. Upholding the correct political direction is not to restrict news reform, but to make news reform proceed on the correct track. No matter how news is reformed, the fundamental nature of the socialist news industry cannot be changed, and the principle of the Party's leadership over the news industry cannot be changed. We cannot detach ourselves from China's national conditions and copy Western news systems and models. The news and public opinion community should deeply carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, fundamentally correct the political direction of news propaganda, and strive to exert creativity under the premise of upholding the correct direction. In the dominant melody, we advocate diversity, constantly improve propaganda art, enhance propaganda effects, maintain the lively and vibrant atmosphere of news reports, and better serve the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

    坚持新闻舆论的正确政治方向
    余自牧
    制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的重大胜利，对于党的新闻工作者来说，感到由衷的喜悦，同时也痛感错误的舆论导向对党的事业造成的危害。今天当我们重新获得安定团结局面的时候，为了新闻事业的未来，不能不对过去进行深刻的反思，并探讨一下形成错误舆论导向的思想理论方面的缘由。
                                （一）
    新闻报道的倾斜，应该说从学潮一开始就产生了。有些新闻报道在肯定多数学生爱国热情的同时，没有指出动乱的明显迹象。而舆论导向的明显错误，则是从突出宣扬赵紫阳同志5月4日会见亚行会议客人的讲话开始的。赵紫阳同志的这个讲话，采用突然袭击的方式，否定了人民日报“4·26”社论关于动乱的论断，实际上向群众表明，对待这场动乱，中央内部有两种不同声音。接着，赵紫阳同志5月6日找中央主管宣传工作的负责同志谈话，说目前新闻自由是个焦点。他肯定前一段对学潮的报道放开了一点，游行作了报道，看来新闻公开程度增加一点，风险不大。他的这个再放开的方针，同他把当时已经形成的动乱和国际反社会主义逆流联系起来，说成是“国际进步潮流”、“国内人心所向”，很明显是动员新闻舆论界出来支持动乱。
    当着中央领导核心出现不同声音的情况下，我们有些新闻工作者不能清醒地辨别，舆论导向的错误愈益明显。一段时间，对步步升级的游行、静坐、绝食等动乱事态，连篇累牍地加以片面报道和夸大渲染；极少数“动乱精英”们纷纷在新闻报道中公开亮相，严家其、包遵信、苏晓康等人的“紧急呼吁”和《5·16声明》等都在有的报纸上公开发表。这种背离中央正确决策的报道，完全被错误的立场和偏激的情绪所左右，绝不是有些人所标榜的“客观、公正”、“讲真话”。
    5月19日，中央召开首都党政军干部大会，宣布了进一步采取果断措施制止动乱的决策，并于5月20日由李鹏总理签署了在首都部分地区实行戒严的命令。至此，发生在中央领导层内部的斗争已经明朗化，赵紫阳同志支持动乱、分裂党的事实已经表露出来。就在这种情况下，仍有某些新闻舆论消极对待中央的正确决策，甚至采取种种手法，宣传与中央决策对立的声音，制造反对戒严的舆论气氛。例如借报道国际新闻，标出诸如《×××总理说不准用军队解决内政问题》这样的大字标题，进行旁敲侧击。有的还采用“春秋笔法”，写“花边新闻”，隐晦曲折地表达自己的观点和情绪。如读者反映强烈的《北京戒严第×天》《天安门广场一瞥》《当今北京人的公德意识》《北京这一夜》等等报道，竟把极少数人正在制造暴乱、处于严重无政府状态的北京城，歪曲描绘成社会秩序井然、人们道德升华的宁静世界；把一些人践踏天安门广场使少年儿童无法欢度节日的情况，歪曲描绘成大学生与少年儿童在天安门广场联欢合影的节日景象；把平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争涂抹得一派悲惨、恐怖。
    新闻舆论的错误导向，产生了极为严重的恶果，对这场旨在推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国的动乱和反革命暴乱，起了推波助澜的作用，助长了极少数动乱策划者的反动气焰，搞乱了广大群众的思想，使人们不能正确认识动乱的实质，正确理解中央的精神。而且，为动乱向全国的蔓延起了恶劣作用。
                              （二）
    新闻舆论导向的错误，根子在赵紫阳同志的严重错误，但在同样的情况下，舆论表现是不同的。这就说明，还需要从新闻队伍自身、从新闻指导思想上找原因。
    资产阶级自由化在新闻领域有两个突出表现：一是把“人民性”同党性分割开来、对立起来；二是宣扬抽象的新闻自由，实质上是资产阶级的新闻自由。这两个方面表现不同，其结果都是否定新闻工作的党性原则，否定党对新闻工作的领导，从而改变新闻工作的正确政治方向。
    关于新闻工作的党性、“人民性”问题，最早是在1979年由胡绩伟同志提出来的。当时提出的问题是：多年来的事实表明，我们党是犯过严重错误的，新闻工作本身也是犯过严重错误的，今后怎样防止类似的错误再度发生呢？于是认为在强调党性的同时，要强调新闻工作的“人民性”。胡绩伟同志关于党性、人民性的说法，虽然经过几次修改，但基本思想是认为党是会犯错误的，人民不会犯错误，当着党犯错误的时候，新闻工作者就要站在人民立场上，反映人民的要求，才能避免跟着党犯错误。他的这个基本思想是反复表达过的，而且在新闻界产生了广泛的影响。
    对于党性、人民性问题上的错误观点，邓小平同志在十二届二中全会讲话中曾经指出，有人“把民主同党的领导对立起来，在党性和人民性的问题上提出违反马克思主义的说法”。这就把问题的实质清楚地揭示了出来。按照马克思主义关于政党、阶级、群众关系的观点，党的领导与人民民主应该是统一的，党性与人民性（这里只是借用这个概念表达新闻要反映人民的利益和要求）也应该是统一的。我们知道，人民内部分为不同的阶级、阶层、利益群体，他们的利益和要求如何体现，是一个复杂的问题。只有以马克思主义武装的、全心全意为人民服务、为最广大人民谋利益的共产党，才能代表人民的利益。这正是党性和人民性统一的根据。把党的领导和人民民主对立起来，把党性和人民性对立起来，以为人民可以离开党，可以单纯依靠群众的自发行动就能正确地决定问题，结果只能摆脱党的领导，陷入无政府状态。有些着意强调人民性的同志，正是把“人民性”作为党性所不能包容的概念来使用的。似乎讲党性，就只能对党负责，就不能同时对人民负责；注重宣传党的主张，就不能同时反映人民的要求，因而他们主张，当着党犯错误的时候，就要强调人民性，用人民性来“补充”党性的不足。这种把人民性和党性分割开来的观点，必然引出这样两种情况：一种是，党的政策、决议正确与否，不是经过社会实践检验，经过党的集体来判断，而要由新闻工作者来判断，把新闻工作者放在了真理裁判官的位置；另一种是，新闻工作者对于党的政策决议，自以为正确的就宣传，自以为不正确的就不宣传，甚而宣传同党的决定相反的声音，还自认为这是在替人民讲话。这两种情况都可能导致一种错误的结论：党会犯错误，新闻工作者则不会犯错误，能够始终正确地反映人民的根本利益。这是很难设想的。我们的新闻工作者，即使是很好的同志，很难保证自己对于党的路线正确与否的判断都是正确的，自己认为好的意见都是代表人民的。而且，党会犯错误，新闻工作者同样会犯错误，如果离开了党的领导，将会犯更大的错误。新闻工作者如果自以为党犯了错误就不执行党的决定，并且自以为代表了人民，其结果势必脱离党的领导，把新闻舆论引向错误的方向。这次某些舆论导向的错误，可以说就是自觉不自觉地在这种错误思想影响下发生的。有些同志确实认为，中央关于动乱性质的判断是不正确的，国务院关于在首都部分地区实行戒严的决定也是不正确的，他们要坚持所谓的“人民性”，要反映人民的声音。
    胡绩伟同志授意四通社会发展研究所策动人大常委签名事件，不是也说：“现在大家对党中央失望了，对政府失望了，寄希望于人大了”。其实他们所说的反映人民的声音，并不代表工人、农民、知识分子的大多数，他们反映的不过是极少数动乱制造者的要求和那些不明真相的群众的一时偏激情绪，而党中央的正确决策，才是真正反映了人民的根本的长远利益的。
    坚持党性，是党的新闻工作的根本原则。共产党的党性，不但集中表现了无产阶级的阶级利益，也反映了人民群众的根本利益。全心全意为人民服务，一切从人民的利益出发，在新闻舆论工作中要正确地反映人民群众的意愿、呼声和要求，同时用马列主义、用党的路线、方针、政策引导群众，这些都是坚持党性原则的题中应有之义。党性原则既规定了党的新闻事业与党的关系，也规定了党的新闻事业与人民的关系，体现了新闻工作对党负责和对人民负责的一致性。那种认为党性只讲与党的关系，人民性才是讲与人民的关系的看法，是错误的。把党性和人民性分割开来，实质上是宣扬人民性高于党性，党性要服从人民性。其结果只能是削弱、动摇甚至取消党性原则，那也就违背了人民的根本利益。
                                （三）
    我们看到，这次极少数动乱策划者就是用抽象的新闻自由，来煽动新闻界一些人支持动乱的。例如当《世界经济导报》因发表要求为反对资产阶级自由化翻案的文章受到处理时，严家其、包遵信、戴晴等人4月28日写了致上海市委的公开信，口号就是“捍卫新闻自由”。新闻舆论导向的错误，也正是受到了这种抽象的新闻自由鼓噪的影响。
    新闻自由，同其他民主自由权利一样，都是具体的，不是抽象的；都是相对的，不是绝对的。不同的社会制度有不同的新闻自由。超阶级的、抽象的新闻自由是不存在的。谈论社会主义条件下的新闻自由，不能离开社会主义的经济基础，不能离开无产阶级和广大人民的根本利益，不能离开新闻事业的社会主义性质和作用。在社会主义社会，新闻自由不仅要遵守宪法和法律，而且要遵守必要的宣传纪律，维护社会的安定团结。这都是维护无产阶级和广大人民群众的利益所必需的。同时，从根本上说，只有在社会主义条件下，才有最广泛的、日益发展的新闻自由。
    需要指出的是，就在动乱不断升级的时候，胡绩伟同志5月8日在《世界经济导报》发表了《没有新闻自由就没有真正的安定》的文章。这篇文章发表在4月26日以后，他只字不讲动乱的性质，不讲极少数人破坏民主法制、根本否定社会主义制度，反而强调没有新闻自由就没有安定团结，认为新闻自由只要不违法就可以了。在这个限度内，什么文章都可以登，什么意见都可以发表。这篇文章的意图何在，不是值得深思吗？
    认为新闻工作只要不违法就可以了，这种说法和看法是很不够的，不仅不能说明社会主义新闻活动的现实，同样也不能说明资本主义新闻活动的现实。诚然，新闻活动不能违法，必须遵守法律，这只是一个方面。还有另一方面，不论在社会主义社会还是在资本主义社会，制约新闻活动的，不仅有法律手段，而且有具体的现实的阶级利益和政治要求。就拿资本主义国家来说，一些由政府或政党举办的新闻事业，总是要维护政府或政党的利益，宣传政府或政党的主张，是很明显的。就是众多的属于私人财团举办的新闻媒介，它们可以批评政府官员，揭露某些官员的丑闻，但从来不敢触动他们的后台老板的分毫利益，不敢得罪他们的广告商，否则立刻就会被敲掉饭碗。哪里有什么充分的普遍的新闻自由呢？然而资产阶级思想家总是把这种以钱袋为转移的自由，宣扬为普遍的自由形式，似乎他们的新闻自由是抽象的、超阶级的，而将其阶级实质掩盖起来。这就是资产阶级新闻自由虚伪性的所在。世界各国新闻的现实状况是，由于社会制度不同，各国的历史传统、国情不同，对于新闻活动的调节方式与手段也不会相同。除了使用法律手段调节外（当然法律也体现一种阶级意志），还要受其他利益的、政治的调控。不管是社会主义还是资本主义，新闻舆论总要为一定的阶级利益服务，这一点是共同的。抽象的、超阶级的新闻自由是没有的。只讲新闻自由的相对性，不讲新闻自由的阶级性，模糊不同社会制度下新闻自由的不同性质，是一种资产阶级也可以接受的观点。
    胡绩伟同志关于新闻自由的说法影响了不少人，使他们陷入对抽象自由的迷恋中而迷失方向。如果按照这种新闻自由去实践，是不可能有真正的社会安定的。新闻违法，固然会影响社会安定，而如果不遵守宣传纪律，违背人民的根本利益，同样会影响社会安定。我们从动乱期间的某些新闻实践和街头行动可以看出，某些人所提倡的新闻自由究竟包含着一些什么内容呢？这就是要有反对中央重大决策的自由，对中央已作出结论的事件任意翻案的自由，传播谣言的自由，甚至包括辱骂党和国家领导人、煽动推翻合法政府的自由等。很明显，如果听任这种新闻自由发展，就不可能有安定团结的局面。这样的新闻自由，绝不是社会主义的新闻自由，而是资产阶级所鼓吹的新闻自由。
    新闻舆论必须坚持正确的政治方向，是由新闻舆论工具的社会主义性质和重要作用所决定的。作为党的新闻舆论工具，应当成为党、政府和人民的耳目喉舌；它的报道和言论，必须无条件地宣传党的路线、方针、政策和政治观点，有利于社会安定团结，有利于社会生产力的发展，有利于人民精神文明水准的提高。
    强调坚持新闻工作的正确方向，并不是说新闻不需要改革了。应该说，端正政治方向与推进新闻改革是统一的。坚持正确的政治方向，绝不是限制新闻改革，而是要使新闻改革沿着正确的轨道前进。新闻不论如何改革，社会主义新闻事业的根本性质不能改，党对新闻事业的领导这条原则不能改。我们不能脱离中国的国情，去照搬西方的新闻制度、新闻模式。新闻舆论界应该深入开展反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，从根本上端正新闻宣传的政治方向，并且力求在坚持正确方向的前提下发挥创造性，在鲜明的主旋律中提倡多样性，不断改进宣传艺术，提高宣传效果，保持新闻报道生动活泼的气氛，更好地为建设有中国特色的社会主义服务。
