    Standing Up for the Chinese Working Class
    – A Record of Wang Tianrun, a Worker at the Antaibao Open-Pit Coal Mine in Pingluo, Shanxi
    Jin Ping

    Wang Tianrun, now 35 years old, is the foreman of the horse team at the Antaibao Open-Pit Coal Mine in Pingluo, Shanxi, which is jointly operated by China and the United States. Since 1985, he has been consecutively named a model worker by the Pingluo Coal Industry Company for four years and was awarded the title of First-Class Labor Model of Shanxi Province in 1989.

    Originally, he was a bucket-wheel excavator operator at the West Open-Pit Coal Mine in Fushun, Liaoning Province. In 1983, he was transferred to Pingluo, Shanxi. In April 1983, he went to Beijing Coal School for training and graduated at the top of his class. Later, after passing three examinations by foreign experts, he was officially approved to go to the Federal Republic of Germany for training on January 3, 1985. There, he quickly obtained a factory training qualification certificate.

    After returning to China, the company arranged for him to participate in the assembly of hydraulic shovels. From 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM, and sometimes as late as 11:00 PM, he worked tirelessly. Once, while installing a boom, due to incomplete equipment, Wang Tianrun had to stand on a forklift 3 meters high to support the pin. Unexpectedly, the crane was overloaded, causing a steel wire to pierce his thigh. A leader suggested he take a few more days off, but he couldn't rest easy in bed and returned to the assembly site after only two days. Foreign workers gave him a thumbs up, praising him as a "good guy."

    On June 26, 1985, the first hydraulic shovel was assembled. After completing the handover and acceptance procedures, it was time to move the shovel to the site. Originally, it was agreed that the factory would be responsible for moving it to the site. However, seeing the complex terrain and a deep ditch to cross, the German factory declined. The company leaders were anxious, fearing that if things went wrong, the shovel might get stuck, affecting the opening ceremony. The Chinese manager asked him, "Tianrun, can you do it?" After inspecting the terrain, he said, "Let me try!" When the bulldozer filled the ditch into a gentle slope, he entered the operating room, pressed the lever, and the hydraulic shovel moved forward slowly, finally climbing up the slope and entering the safe area on the platform. The hundreds of thousands of yuan worth of property had safely reached its destination. Deputy General Manager Zhou Ziyi tightly held Wang Tianrun's hand and said, "What the foreigners were afraid to do, the Chinese successfully accomplished. Tianrun, thank you! You have made us proud!"

    From mid-July to mid-August 1985, in addition to his regular work, Wang Tianrun also assisted the German factory in training 10 hydraulic shovel operators in one month, all of whom obtained qualification certificates. There was no interpreter on site, his English was not fluent, and other Chinese workers did not understand either. Every day, they communicated through simple language and gestures. Under these circumstances, he carried a "Small English-Chinese Dictionary" with him. If he got stuck, he would look it up. On Sundays, when foreign employees rested, he continued to study, either doing simulations or carefully checking, maintaining, and wiping the equipment. When a large number of operators entered the site for training, he had already obtained four types of large equipment operation qualification certificates issued by the American side.

    One day, a newly trained bulldozer operator, due to lack of experience, caused the bulldozer to tilt forward. The operator was frightened and did not know what to do, still sitting in the operating room. Wang Tianrun rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and shouted, "Get down quickly, it's dangerous!" The operator then jumped off the bulldozer. At this moment, the hydraulic shovel operating below the bulldozer was in danger of being hit. If the two machines collided, they would definitely damage the equipment parts, causing huge economic losses. At this critical moment, Wang Tianrun quickly shouted for the hydraulic shovel operator to use the bucket to prop up the bulldozer and called another bulldozer to pull the one that was about to slide down. A major accident was thus avoided. The foreign manager, Henderson, was overjoyed and repeatedly praised, "OK, OK!" The managers and workers from both sides present all smiled.

    At around 4:30 AM on April 5, 1987, Wang Tianrun suddenly received an order from the American manager via walkie-talkie to go to Cuijialing to rescue a bulldozer. Upon arriving at the scene, he was shocked to find that a shovel loader operator had accidentally driven the bulldozer down a slope 5 meters, although it was supported by soil, it was in imminent danger of falling into a 30-meter-deep ditch. The foreign duty manager had no idea what to do. Wang Tianrun carefully inspected the terrain and called two bulldozers, attempting to pull the bulldozer up using a towing method. However, since the bulldozer was stuck in loose soil, there was no place to hang the steel wire, and he had to crawl in to hook the steel wire to the towing hook. He lay on the ground, inching forward while pulling the steel wire, using his hands to dig out the soil bit by bit. Half an hour later, the towing hook was exposed, and the steel wire was hooked up. After two hours of rescue, the bulldozer was pulled onto the platform, out of danger. The foreign duty manager was deeply moved and shouted, "Great job, Mr. Wang has the skills, the experience, and definitely deserves a reward."

    Such incidents happened frequently. Whenever an accident occurred, even foreign employees would call him via walkie-talkie, saying he had the solution. In mid-August last year, due to heavy rainfall, the three large water pumps for dewatering the 9th coal seam were all submerged. To drain the water, the pumps had to be pulled out first. The rain was still falling, and he did not even take off his clothes, searching for the location of the water pumps and finally pulling the three pumps to a higher position. Over the past three years, he has participated in the rescue of more than 50 major accidents.

    Working at the Antaibao Mine, Wang Tianrun often interacts with foreigners and pays close attention to their management methods. Inspired by foreign experts, he first tried a new coal mining method in his team, which, based on the operating environment and climate conditions, implemented procedures such as road watering to prevent slipping, coal type matching, and moisture adjustment in the operating process. This ensured safe production and improved product quality. Foreign employees appreciated this approach and quickly promoted it. In September 1987, the 38th excavator operation point encountered a massive rock, averaging over 30 cubic meters each, which the excavator could not handle, and blasting was dangerous. Later, Wang Tianrun thought that using two front loaders to lift and a dump truck to load might work. After a trial, it was successful. The American manager jokingly said, "Handling large blocks is Mr. Wang's patent."

    Wang Tianrun excitedly told the reporter, "I am an ordinary Chinese worker and cannot disgrace the Chinese people. I must stand up for the Chinese working class!"

    为中国工人阶级争气
    ——记山西平朔安太堡露天煤矿工人王天润
    进平
    王天润，今年35岁，是中美合作经营的平朔安太堡露天煤矿马班工长。1985年以来，他连续4年被平朔煤炭工业公司评为标兵，1989年荣获山西省特级劳动模范称号。
    他原是辽宁省抚顺西露天煤矿的一名电铲司机，1983年调来山西平朔。1983年4月，他来到北京煤校接受培训，结业考试获得了总分第一名，后来，又经过外国专家的三次考试，1985年1月3日正式被批准去联邦德国培训。在那儿，他很快取得了厂家培训合格证书。
    回国后，公司安排他参加液压铲组装工作。从早晨7点半上班，到晚6点下班，最晚的时候11点下班。有一次安装吊臂时，由于设备不完善，王天润只好站在离地3米高的叉车上托住销子，没想到吊车超负荷使用，结果钢丝绳断裂，一根钢丝扎进他的大腿里。一位领导让他多休息几天，他躺在病床上怎么也不安心，只休息两天就又上组装现场了。外方职工向他竖大拇指，夸他是“好样的”。
    1985年6月26日，第一台液压铲组装完毕，公司领导赶到现场祝贺。交接验收程序办完后，准备把铲开到现场。原先定好是厂家负责开到现场，这时联邦德国厂家看到地形复杂，要过一条深沟，就不干了。在场的公司领导心急如焚，怕搞不好会把铲陷下去，影响开业典礼。中方经理问他：“天润，你行吗？”他察看了地形后，说道：“让我试试！”当推土机把沟填成缓坡时，他进操作室，按动了操纵杆，液压铲缓缓前行，终于爬上斜坡，进入平台安全地带。上百万元的财产总算平安地到达目的地了。公司副总经理周子义紧紧拉着王天润的手说：“外国人胆怯的事，中国人却成功了。天润，感谢你啊！你给咱中国人争了气！”
    1985年7月中旬到8月中旬，王天润除负责正常生产外，还协助联邦德国厂家在一个月内培训了10名液压铲司机，使他们全部拿到了合格证书。现场没有翻译，他的外语又不熟，其他中国工人更不懂，每天全凭简单的口语加手势来沟通交流。在这种情况下他就随身带了本“英汉小词典”，卡壳了，就翻辞典。星期日，外国职员休息，他还继续学习，不是做模拟练习，就是仔细检查、保养擦拭。当大批操作工进入现场培训时，他已经获得了美方颁发的四种大型设备操作合格证。
    一天，新培训的推土机司机因缺乏经验，致使推土机身向前倾斜，司机吓得不知所措，仍呆在操作室里。王天润闻讯后立即赶去，大喊“快下来，危险！”司机才跳下了推土机。此时，推土机前下方作业的液压铲正处于被砸的危险中。如果两台设备相撞，肯定会损坏设备部件，造成巨大的经济损失。在这千钧一发之际，王天润急忙喊液压铲司机赶快用铲斗顶住推土机，又调了一台推土机，才把那台即将下滑的推土机牵引上来。一场重大事故终于避免了。外方经理汉德森喜形于色，连口称赞“OK，OK！”在场的中外双方经理和工人都笑了。
    1987年4月5日凌晨四点半左右，王天润突然从步话机里接到了美方经理的指令，到崔家岭扶救推土机。他驱车赶到现场后大吃一惊，一名铲运机司机在倒车时不慎将推土机滑下坡5米处，虽然被土托住，但随时都有翻下30多米深沟的危险。外方值班经理也没有一点办法。王天润仔细察看地形后，调了两台推土机，想用牵引的办法把那台推土机拉上来。可是由于推土机翻在虚土里，钢丝绳没地方挂，只有钻进去才能把钢丝绳挂到牵引钩上。他趴在地上，一边往前挪身子，一边拽着钢丝绳，用手一点一点往外扒土，半个小时后，牵引钩露出来了，钢丝绳挂上了。经过两小时的扶救，推土机拉上了平台，脱离危险。外方值班经理很受感动，大声喊：“太好了，王先生有办法，有经验，一定要重奖。”
    这样的事出现不少。一旦有事故出现，就连外方职员也用步话机喊他，说他有办法。去年8月中旬，由于连降大雨，9号煤层抽水的3台大水泵全被淹没，要排水必须先拖出水泵。雨还在下着，他连衣服也没脱，寻找水泵位置，终于将3台水泵拖到较高位置。3年来，他参加抢救较大事故就有50多起。
    在安太堡矿工作，整天跟外国人打交道，王天润很注意外方的管理方法。在外方专家的启发下，他首先在组里试行了一套新的采煤法，即根据作业环境和气候条件，在作业程序上实行了道路洒水防滑、煤种配装和水份调节等操作工艺，既保证了安全生产，又提高了产品质量。外籍人员很欣赏这种做法，很快将其推广。1987年9月，38号电铲作业点出现了特大岩石，平均每块30多立方米，电铲装不了，爆破有危险。后来王天润想，用两台前装机对抬，卡车倒装的办法也许能行。经过一试，果然成功了。美方经理风趣地说：“装大块是王先生的专利。”
    王天润激动地对笔者说：“我是中国的一个普通工人，不能给中国人丢脸，要为中国工人阶级争气！”
