Building Private Houses and Investigating Private Gain

People live in this world and cannot do without housing. Who wouldn't want to live in a spacious and comfortable home? Nowadays, as people's living standards gradually improve, in places where conditions permit, cadres and the masses use their labor earnings to build houses legally and in accordance with regulations to improve their living conditions. This is not only acceptable but also a fortunate thing that should be protected. The problem lies in the fact that some leading cadres, in order to build private houses, do not hesitate to illegally seize land or use land beyond the standard; some, despite having limited material and financial resources, still insist on expanding their scope and engaging in large-scale construction. When one private mansion after another rises before the public eye, do they know how much the cost of these mansions differs from the legitimate income of their owners? How much state and collective property has been embezzled, extorted, or appropriated within? Do they know how much power has been abused and how much private gain has been sought, leading to such serious consequences? Do they know how sharp the criticism from the people is towards such behavior?

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized the need to oppose the improper practice of cadres using their power for personal gain, and the illegal construction of private houses is included in this opposition. However, why do some cadres still not heed the warnings and act brazenly, doing as they please? Perhaps, in meetings and reports, they talk a lot about not allowing the illegal occupation of arable land; they talk a lot about how the living conditions and housing of the people are currently difficult, and how one should care for them; they talk a lot about how cadres should be clean in their governance and not harm the interests of the state and the collective. However, their unscrupulous construction of villas and courtyards exposes their own lawlessness and disorder, as well as their pursuit of enjoyment and desire for comfort. Such cadres cannot help but invite criticism from the people.

Investigating and dealing with cadres' illegal construction of private houses is a specific measure to combat corruption. This work must not be a mere formality; it must be genuine. Regardless of the unit or person involved, fines should be imposed where fines are due, houses should be confiscated where confiscation is due, and disciplinary actions should be taken where disciplinary actions are due. Illegal actors should not be allowed to benefit. In the past, some places have seen the phenomenon of "investigating while building," which means investigating but not strictly, often resorting to "criticism and education," "not repeating the mistake," and "settling with a few dollars." This way, those who illegally built private houses were not much affected. There are also those who find various excuses to resist criticism and investigation. Such issues must be seriously addressed by all places, and strategies must be developed to resolve them.

A servant of the people should consider this question: What will be left for society during one's tenure? For those with the virtues of "worrying about the world before others do and enjoying after others do" and "how can I provide a thousand rooms to shelter all the scholars from the cold," what is left is the good deeds done for the people, not the "comfortable nests" built through the misuse of power for personal gain.

　　建私房与查营私
    人生在世，离不开住房。谁不想住得宽敞点、舒服点？如今，随着人们生活水平逐步提高，在有条件的地方，干部群众用自己的劳动所得，依法遵章建房，改善居住条件，一不为过，二为幸事，应该受到保护。问题在于，少数领导干部为建私房，有的不惜违法征地或超标准用地；有的本来物力、财力有限，还非要铺开摊子、大兴土木不可。当那一幢幢干部私宅在众目睽睽之下拔地而起之时，可知道，这私宅的造价与房主人的正常收入有多大的反差，里边挪用、索取、侵占了国家和集体多少资财！可知道，这里边是怎样的滥用职权、以权谋私，带来了多么严重的后果！可知道，老百姓对这种行为的批评是多么尖锐！
    党中央、国务院三令五申，反对领导干部以权谋私的不正之风，违法营建私房就在反对之列。但为什么有些干部就是不听招呼，胆大妄为，我行我素？也许，他们在会议上，报告中大谈不准滥占耕地；大谈现在群众生活、住房比较困难，要关心云云；大谈干部要为政清廉，不准侵害国家和集体的利益。然而，他们不择手段营建的小楼深院，却暴露了自身的违法乱纪和追求享受、贪图安逸的思想。这样的干部，不能不引起群众的非议。
    查处干部违法营建私房，是惩治腐败的一项具体内容。这项工作切忌走过场，要动真的，不管涉及什么单位，什么人，该罚款的罚款，该收房的收房，该处分的处分，不能让违法者占便宜。过去，有的地方出现一边“查处”一边“营建”的现象，就是查而不严，往往采取“批评教育”、“下不为例”、“补几个钱”了事。这一来，对那些违法营建私房的干部并没有多大触动。还有的营私者寻找种种借口，抵制批评、查处。诸如此类，各地要认真对待，拿出对策，加以解决。
    一个人民的公仆，应该考虑这样一个问题：在自己当政时，留给社会的是什么？对那些具有“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”、“安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜”的品德的人来说，留下的是为人民群众办了多少实事、好事，而不是以权谋私建起的“安乐窝”。
