The car ascended the winding road of the Naduola snow mountain. Outside the window, clusters of rhododendrons flashed by, their vibrant red a striking sight. As we approached the summit, a large wooden gate came into view, bearing a couplet: "The highland's wind and snow are cold, but a thousand homes sleep peacefully; with resolve, we strive for the Four Modernizations, our hearts in the borderlands." A soldier stood guard there. Beyond this gate lay the military restricted area.

After the soldier checked our credentials, the car continued. Not far ahead, it stopped at a small concrete bridge. It was already early May, and while the mountainside was ablaze with flowers, before us lay a world of ice and snow. To reach the outpost at the summit, we would have to rely on our own two legs.

Gazing over the pristine white snow, the outpost seemed within reach. The low walls built by the soldiers, seen from afar, resembled the Great Wall.

At first, with a sense of novelty, I trudged forward, sinking knee-deep in the snow with each step. The crunching sound beneath my feet was quite pleasant. But after a few dozen steps, I was already panting, my heart pounding as if it would leap out of my chest. I checked my pulse—130 beats per minute. Looking up, the outpost seemed just as far away.

Thus, with each step a struggle, we reached the Naduola Pass outpost in Yadong County at an altitude of 4,413 meters. My pants were soaked to the knees, and my shoes filled with snow. A kilometer-long journey took nearly two hours. For us, who rarely climb mountains, the sense of accomplishment was akin to that of a team conquering Mount Everest.

"The Crystal Palace" Owners

Deputy Political Instructor Luo Donghai warmly received us. He was of average height, with a round face, and had been at Naduola for two years.

"Naduola is snowbound for eight months of the year, with no road access, and often faces winds of seven or eight levels, sometimes even blowing off the iron roofs. This past spring, a heavy snowfall buried an entire platoon's quarters, and the soldiers had to dig a hole to escape. In the summer, mist starts to roll in from below at noon, and it rains almost every day. The soldiers jokingly say, 'Half the year is wind and snow, half the year is mist and rain; in winter, we live in a crystal palace, in summer, a water curtain cave.'"

At this, Luo Donghai smiled.

"Due to the inconvenient transportation, we mostly eat tofu skins, noodles, dried vegetables, and canned goods. This spring, before the New Year, our superiors sent us a batch of meat and fresh vegetables. The truck couldn't go beyond 15 kilometers, so we sent dozens of soldiers to retrieve it. We set out at 10 AM, each person carrying a can of food and half a pound of dry rations, with an average load of 25 kilograms. By noon, the wind and snow hit, freezing our eyebrows and beards. We ate dry rations with snow. The 15-kilometer journey took us until midnight. Looking at the basket, the small white cabbages were almost mashed into a pulp. We drink snow water; it takes about a month to receive a letter from home; there's electricity for only about five months a year. Raising pigs here is difficult; they either freeze to death or grow slowly due to the high altitude. A pig takes nearly two years to reach 200 pounds. Though the living conditions are harsh, the soldiers' morale is high. Whether on guard duty, training, or construction, everyone is eager to participate, with no complaints. On the contrary, years of military life have made us feel a deep bond with the outpost and our comrades. This year, when we sent off the old soldiers for demobilization, the formation was ready, the drums were beating, and the political instructor was about to speak. He only managed to say 'Comrades...' before tears welled up. He waved his hand and said only one word, 'March!' At that moment, those leaving and those staying, many of us cried."

The Story of Mu Zhongming

When his little baby entered the world, every first-time father longs to kiss that tender face. But Mu Zhongming did not have this joy, nor will he ever.

Mu Zhongming was originally a platoon political instructor at the Naduola outpost. Until his martyrdom, he had never seen his one-year-old son. He had three chances to visit home...

The first time, he could have made it in time for his baby's birth, but he gave his spot to another platoon leader. The second time, seeing the heavy workload of the platoon, he stayed. The third time, he was tasked with delivering firewood to the frontline and volunteered to complete the task before returning home. That day, he led over 20 soldiers to complete the mission. In the evening, he settled the weary soldiers, visited two new platoon leaders, and then dragged his heavy legs back to the platoon headquarters. Due to overwork, he slipped and fell off a cliff.

Two days before his martyrdom, he had just received a photo of his son and a letter from his father. The letter said that his family was waiting for him to return.

The Tibet Military Region posthumously awarded Mu Zhongming the Second-Class Merit Citation and called on everyone to learn from him.

There were no gunshots, no cannon fire, no sounds of battle, yet Mu Zhongming died so heroically.

Songs by the Fireplace

On the steps outside, a small bird hopped around in a birdcage made from a cardboard box by the soldiers;
The mountaintop had only a small patch of flat ground, where the soldiers built a basketball court (though it might be called the world's highest). Despite the surrounding fence over a meter high, the mischievous ball often found a way to bounce out, forcing the soldiers to chase it down into the valley, a round trip taking at least half an hour;
The ping-pong table in the activity room was pitted and chipped, with a missing corner and cracks;
A concrete brick with a wire wrapped around it, the other end tied to a stick, was a homemade arm-strengthening device made by the soldiers;
When some people in society call them "stupid soldiers," what do the soldiers think? The answer is on the wall of the "May 4th Special Issue":
To Comrades, Do Not Be Ashamed

From some point on, the color of military green has gradually faded in people's minds, and some in society always look at soldiers with a condescending gaze.

Comrades, do not be ashamed. Scientists use knowledge to invent and create, workers and farmers use their hands to produce wealth, and we soldiers use our lives to protect them. We might have become factory managers or executives, but for the sake of more people realizing their dreams, we put on green military uniforms and marched in step.

Some say soldiers are lowly, but this is their ignorance; we can operate radios, computers, and various modern machines; some say soldiers do not value emotions, but I think it is precisely because of our deep emotions that we wear the green uniforms...

Dear comrades, hold your heads high. Let us forge an unyielding military spirit with our lives and blood.

02 Artillery Group

It is this foresight and pride of the soldiers that makes them not only focus on the present but also design a beautiful future in the ice and snow. Many soldiers have enrolled in correspondence courses, including economics, secretarial work, administrative management, calligraphy, radio, accounting, guitar, car repair, and more.

In the dormitory, I sat with a few soldiers around the fireplace. The pot on the fire, bubbling away, was cooking dried vegetables from 1974 (there were supposedly some from 1963 as well). I asked one of the soldiers:

"Do you miss home?"

"Of course."

On summer nights without snow, the sky is blue, and the moon is particularly beautiful. At such times, many are troubled by homesickness. Soldier Liu Changxi had an idea and started a moon-themed newsletter with everyone, writing and printing it themselves to express their feelings.

By the red glow of the fireplace, a soldier sang the "Song of Naduola":

"Farewell to loved ones, leaving home, to the Naduola border. The towering ice peaks are my steel guns, the small sentry post is my place of dedication. On the patrol path lies my aspiration, by the border marker lies my dream. Ah, in the wind and snow, I express my feelings, on the sentry post, I shine."

The song echoed in the small room, and as I listened, a warm current surged from my heart, and my eyes grew moist.

    雪山哨卡——乃堆拉
    本报记者　傅旭
    登上乃堆拉
    汽车沿着乃堆拉雪山的公路盘旋而上。车窗外不时闪现过一丛丛杜鹃花，红得那般耀眼。离山顶越来越近，一座木头搭成的大门出现在眼前，上写一副对联：“高原风雪寒万家睡梦香，立志干四化吾心在边疆。”一位战士守卫在那里。由此进去，即属军事防区。
    战士检查过我们的证件后，车子继续前行。走不多远，停在一座小水泥桥前。当时已是5月初，山腰处山花烂漫，而眼前却是冰雪世界。要想到达山顶的哨卡，只有靠我们的两条腿了。
    视线越过皑皑白雪，哨卡似乎近在咫尺。战士们垒就的矮墙，远远看去酷似长城。
    开始，带着一股新奇，我深一脚浅一脚地踏着没膝深的雪向前走，脚下发出“咯吱、咯吱”的声响，甚是惬意。待到几十步出去，我已是气喘吁吁，心跳得要蹦出来，一摸脉搏，130多下，抬头望望，哨卡好像还是那么远。
    就这样，一步三喘，我们来到了亚东县境内海拔4413米的乃堆拉山口哨卡。半截裤腿湿透了，鞋里灌满了雪水，一公里多的路竟走了近两小时。对于我们这些很少登山的内地人来说，此时此刻的心情可以说与征服珠峰的登山队员是一样兴奋。
              “水晶宫”的主人
    副指导员罗东海热情地接待了我们。他个头不高，圆圆的脸，来到乃堆拉已两年了。
      “乃堆拉一年有8个月大雪封山，不通公路，常刮七八级大风，有时铁皮屋顶都能给揭掉。今年春节前后下了一场大雪，将一个班的房子埋了，战士们在门前挖了个洞才钻出来。夏季，每天12点过后雾就从下面慢慢围上来，几乎天天下雨。战士们风趣地说：‘半年风雪，半年雨雾，冬居水晶宫，夏住水帘洞’”。说到这里，罗东海笑了。
      “由于交通不便，我们吃的一般都是豆腐皮、粉条、干菜和罐头等。今年春节前夕，上级给我们送来一批肉和鲜菜，汽车走到15公里处上不来了。我们派出几十人下去接。上午10点出发，一人发了一筒罐头，半斤干粮，而每人平均负重达25公斤。12点一过，风雪来了，眉毛、胡子都是冰，饿了就着雪吃干粮。十几公里的路，大家拉呀、拖呀，等回到驻地，已是深夜12点多了。一看，筐里的小白菜都快揉成菜团子了。我们吃的是雪水；一个月左右才能收到家信；一年只有5个月左右有电。在这儿养猪，不是容易冻死，就是由于海拔高长得慢，一头猪养近两年，才长200多斤。生活条件虽然艰苦，但战士们的情绪却很高，不管是站岗、训练、施工，大家都争先恐后，没什么怨言。相反，几年的部队生活，使大家对哨卡、对战友都产生了一种难分难舍的情感。今年欢送老兵复员，队伍集合好了，锣鼓敲起来了，该指导员讲话了，他只喊了一声‘同志们……’眼泪就下来了，他一挥手，只说了一句‘出发！’。当时，走的，在的，好多人都哭了。”
            穆忠明的故事
    当自己的小宝贝来到人世间那一刹那，每一位初次当爸爸的谁不想早早去吻吻那稚嫩的脸蛋儿。但是，穆忠明却没有享受到这一欢乐，而且永远不会了。
    穆忠明原是乃堆拉哨卡的一位连指导员，直到牺牲，他还没有见过自己已满1岁的儿子一面。他曾有过3次探家的机会……
    第一次，他本可以赶上小宝宝降临人世的幸福时刻，他让给了另一位连领导。第二次，他看到连队任务重，又没走。第三次，正值往阵地送柴禾，他主动要求送完柴禾再回家。那天，他带领20多名战士完成了任务。晚上，他安顿好劳累了一天的战士，又看望了两位新排长，才拖着两条沉重的腿向连部走去。由于疲劳过度，一脚踩空，跌下悬崖。
    在牺牲的前两天，他刚刚收到儿子的照片，父亲的信。信中说，家里人在等着他回来。
    西藏军区给穆忠明追记二等功，并号召向他学习。
    没有枪声，没有炮声，没有厮杀声，然而穆忠明却死得这样悲壮。
            火塘边的歌声
    屋外的台阶上，一只小鸟在战士用纸箱改做的鸟笼里蹦来蹦去；
    山顶上仅有一块不大的平地，是战士们修建的篮球场（不知这个篮球场可不可以称得上世界最高）。尽管周围围着一人多高的铁丝网，调皮的球还总要找机会蹦出去，害得战士追到山沟里去捡，一个来回少说得半个小时；
    活动室里那张乒乓球台，台面坑坑洼洼不说，还缺角、裂缝；
    一块水泥砖中间用电线缠绕着，电线另一头拴在一节木棍儿中间，这是战士自己制作的练臂力的器械；
    在社会上不少人管他们叫“傻大兵”时，战士们是怎样想的呢？墙上的“五·四专刊”有他们的回答：
            战友，请别自卑
    不知从什么时候起，国防绿已在人们的心目中渐渐褪色，社会上一些人总是用一种居高临下的眼光看待军人。
    战友，请别自卑。科学家用知识发明创造，工人和农民用双手生产财富，而我们军人则是用生命捍卫他们。我们本来也许会当厂长或经理，然而为了更多的人能实现自己的理想，我们穿上了绿色的军装，为了祖国的安宁和人民的幸福，我们操起了正步。
    有人说，当兵的低能，这是他们的无知，我们能驾驭无线电微机等各种现代化机器；有人说当兵的不重感情，我想，正因为重感情才穿起绿色的军装……
    亲爱的战友，抬起你们骄傲的头，让我们用生命和热血铸成巍巍军魂。
                                  02炮组
    正是这种战士的远见和骄傲，使他们不仅着眼于眼前，还在冰天雪地里为自己设计着美好的未来。不少战士参加了函授学习，有经济、秘书、行政管理、书法、无线电、财会、吉他速成、汽车修理等。
    在宿舍里，我和几名战士一起围坐在火塘边，火塘上咕嘟作响的锅里正熬着1974年的干菜（据说还有1963年的）。我问一位战士：
      “想家吗？”“当然想了。”
    夏天晚上没雪，天是蓝色的，月亮特别美。每当此时，不少人为思乡之情所困扰。战士刘长喜灵机一动，和大家一起办起了月亮专刊，自编自印，抒发情思。
    映着红红的炉火，一位战士唱起了《乃堆拉之歌》：
      “告别了亲人，离开了家乡，来到乃堆拉边防线上。林立的冰峰是我树起的钢枪，小小岗篷是我奉献的地方，巡逻道上有我的志向，界碑旁刻下我的理想。啊，我在风雪中抒情，我在哨位上闪光。”
    歌声在小屋里久久地回荡，听着听着，只觉得一股热流从心底直往上涌，我的眼睛不知不觉湿润了。
