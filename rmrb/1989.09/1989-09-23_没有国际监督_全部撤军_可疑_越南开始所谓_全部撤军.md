    Suspicious "Complete Withdrawal" Without International Supervision
    Vietnam Begins Alleged "Complete Withdrawal"

    Phnom Penh, September 21st was the first day of Vietnam's alleged withdrawal of its "last batch of troops" from Cambodia. Only over 300 reporters from the West, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Laos, and Cuba were present to cover the event, with no international monitoring organizations in attendance. This withdrawal, lacking United Nations-led international supervision, will not be recognized by the international community.

    That day, units under the jurisdiction of the 479th Front Command of the invading Vietnamese forces in Cambodia gathered in military vehicles and buses in Siem Reap and Battambang. However, reporters did not see any Vietnamese tanks or heavy artillery. Some Western reporters said that the Phnom Penh regime imposed many restrictions on the reporting of this "withdrawal." If they stepped out of the designated boundaries, they would encounter trouble.

    Western news agencies reported that the "entire force" that Vietnam claimed to withdraw amounted to only 26,000 troops. On September 21st, the Vietnamese military held a "farewell ceremony" in the provincial capitals of Battambang and Siem Reap. However, on the Cambodian side of the Cambodian-Thai border, artillery fire continued. In the Banteay Meanchey region of Battambang, a group of Phnom Penh troops harassed Trat Province in Thailand, with some surrendering to Thai border defense forces.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 21st. According to reports from the Thai-Cambodian border, approximately 120 soldiers of the Phnom Penh regime escaped from Cambodia and surrendered to Thai border troops on September 20th. This was one of the largest-scale collective defections by Phnom Penh regime soldiers in recent times.

### 没有国际监督  “全部撤军”可疑  越南开始所谓“全部撤军”

    没有国际监督  “全部撤军”可疑
    越南开始所谓“全部撤军”
    新华社北京9月22日电  金边消息：9月21日是越南从柬埔寨撤出所谓“最后一批部队”的第一天。只有来自西方、苏联、越南、老挝和古巴的300多名记者去采访，没有任何国际监督机构在场。这种没有由联合国牵头的国际监督的撤军，不会被国际社会所承认。
    这天，属于侵柬越军479前线指挥部管辖的数批越军乘坐军车、公共汽车集结在暹粒市、菩萨市等地。但是记者们没有看到越军的坦克、大炮等重型武器。一些西方记者说，金边政权对这次“撤军”的报道多所限制。要是越出他们规定的轨道，就会引起麻烦。
    西方通讯社报道说，越南自称将撤走的“全部部队”仅有26000人。21日，越军在马德望省和暹粒省省会举行“告别仪式”。但是，在柬泰边境柬方一侧，炮声不断。在马德望省的拜林地区，一股金边军队袭扰泰国占他武里府，有的向泰国边防部队投降。
  新华社曼谷9月21日电据来自泰柬边界的消息，金边政权士兵约120人20日逃离柬埔寨，投向泰国边防军。这是近期来金边政权士兵一次较大规模的集体叛逃。
