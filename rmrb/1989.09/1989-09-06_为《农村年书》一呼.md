Title: A Call for the Revival of the "Rural Almanac"
Author: Chen Yunhao
Date: 1989-09-06
Edition: 1

On the desk of the People's Publishing House, there is a stack of subscription forms recently received, which are for a book titled "Rural Almanac (1990 Edition)" compiled by the publishing house's staff over nearly half a year. The "Rural Almanac" (originally named "The East is Red") has been published annually since the 1960s, serving as a large-scale rural encyclopedia in the lunar calendar format, with nearly 20 years of continuous publication. The highest print run was 1.5 million copies in one year, and the lowest was 460,000 copies. Most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country ordered more than 100,000 copies each. Rural readers generally considered it a practical and useful book that aids in the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in rural areas. A few years ago, due to certain reasons, the publication was suspended for a period. This spring, the People's Publishing House decided to revive the "Rural Almanac" to do something practical for rural readers. To accommodate rural readers, it was decided to implement cost-recovery sales.

The subscription forms for the 1990 edition of the "Rural Almanac" were sent to various provincial Xinhua Bookstores in May, and by the end of July, the subscription forms were collected. The plan is to publish the book in October. Upon seeing the subscription numbers, one is taken aback. The total number of books ordered from 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions is only 4,300 copies, which is less than the number ordered by a single province in the past. Among the 30 subscription forms, the highest order is from Xinjiang with 605 copies, and Henan with 509 copies. The lowest order is just 2 copies.

The relevant staff of the People's Publishing House were too optimistic in their original estimates, believing that such a book that meets the needs of rural areas would at least be ordered in quantities of two to three hundred thousand copies nationwide. At the very least, it would not be less than one hundred thousand copies! Moreover, preparations for paper and printing have already been made. However, the reality is so unexpected. It seems that this type of book, which is suitable and in demand in rural areas, requires the assistance of units and comrades responsible for rural distribution work!

    为《农村年书》一呼
    陈允豪
    在人民出版社的办公桌上放着一摞新近收到的订书单，是出版社的同志花了近半年心血编的一本《农村年书》（1990年本）的征订单。《农村年书》（原名《东方红》），从60年代起，每年出版一本，是大型农历形式的农村小百科，连续出书近20年。当时的印数，最多的一年有150多万册，最少的一年也有46万册。全国大部分省、市、区都订购一万册以上。农村读者普遍认为这是一本通俗、实用，有助于农村两个文明建设的好书。前几年因故停了一段时间，今年春天，人民出版社决心把《农村年书》复刊，为农村读者办件实事。为照顾农村读者，决定实行保本销售。
    1990年本《农村年书》的征订单是今年5月份发到各个省级新华书店的，7月底订单收齐了，准备10月份出书。一看订数，使人大吃一惊。30个省、市、区的订书单上的数字共计只有4300本，还没有当年一个省的订数多。30张订书单中，多的如新疆，订购605本；河南，订购509本。少的有订购2本的。
    人民出版社的有关同志原来估计得太乐观了，认为这样适合农村需要的书，全国各地加起来至少也能订购二三十万册。退而言之，总不会十万册以下吧！而且纸张、印刷等准备工作都做好了。可是现实却如此出人意料。看来这类在农村适销对路的书，有必要请负责农村发行工作的单位和同志们助出版社一臂之力！
