Based on the same-named novel, through the collaborative efforts of the scriptwriter, director, and cast, the enigmatic and poignant love story between the Shunzhi Emperor (Fulin) and the Consort Donggo (Wuyunzhu) has been adapted into a captivating opera—"Young Emperor." This opera is filled with laughter and tears, elegant in tone, and beautiful in atmosphere.

The love between the emperor and his consort is not a mere ethereal fantasy. The mutual admiration, love, and union between Fulin and Wuyunzhu go beyond mere physical attraction and shared interests. More importantly, their political and ideological stances aligned. At that time, the Qing dynasty had just established its rule, and the country was in disarray. To unify the nation and strengthen the dynasty, Fulin, with Wuyunzhu's support and encouragement, sought to break away from certain Manchu traditions and implement reforms suitable for the times, appointing talented individuals without prejudice. However, this initial intention to adapt to the changing times did not receive understanding or support from the court and the officials; instead, it faced obstruction, slander, and hostility from the conservative forces led by Prince Jidu.

"Young Emperor" vividly portrays and reveals the conflict between reform and conservatism through key scenes such as the family banquet incident, the death of the fourth prince, the imperial family trial, and Wuyunzhu's suicide. Within the main love story of Fulin and Wuyunzhu, the opera skillfully weaves in intricate conflicts, reflecting the complexities of human nature and the ever-changing political landscape. It avoids the common weaknesses of traditional operas, such as limited scope, narrow thinking, and shallow content. Compared to melodramas or pure romantic dramas, "Young Emperor" stands out.

"Young Emperor" delves deeply into the inner worlds of its characters, showcasing remarkable skill. The protagonist Fulin, inheriting the legacy of his predecessors, ascended to the throne at the age of six, truly a "young emperor" basking in success. He was naturally romantic, deeply influenced by Han culture from a young age, with rich emotions and a distinct personality, believing he could control and dominate everything. However, after a decade on the throne, the harsh realities eroded his ambitions and vigor, leading him to often lament, "I want to do but cannot, I want to change but cannot," and "I am powerless to display my talents." He frequently entertained thoughts of retreating to the mountains to become a monk. In an environment filled with loneliness, isolation, intrigue, and traps, his character became twisted, growing increasingly tyrannical and unpredictable. Wuyunzhu's entrance into his life made his heart race, filling him with joy and unleashing uncontrollable passion. In his quest for a kindred spirit, his emotions overwhelmed his reason, momentarily losing his composure and dignity, experiencing the pain of longing despite his imperial status. After many twists and turns, Wuyunzhu finally joined him, becoming his inseparable companion and trusted advisor, providing him with warmth, comfort, and strength. He could not help but express, "For Wuyunzhu, I would give up the throne." These words of heroic weakness and romantic longing, this carefree nature, and this independent behavior are so at odds with his imperial status and the interests of the dynasty! The historical Fulin was indeed such an emperor with a strong personality and fragile emotions. Due to the support of Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang and the regent Dorgon, he spent his life under their wings, with mediocre achievements throughout his reign. Compared to his predecessors Nurhaci and Huangtaiji, and his successors Kangxi and Qianlong, he was undoubtedly inferior.

"Young Emperor" brings Fulin down from his pedestal, portraying his character, mindset, and emotions, revealing his frustration, anxiety, and resentment at being unable to be a free man despite his imperial status. It expresses his profound sorrow and endless longing after losing his beloved. The opera creates a vivid and realistic image of an emperor. If the creators had not emphasized Fulin's supposed "consensus for reform," the character would have been even more natural and authentic.

Equally impressive is Wuyunzhu. She possesses not only unparalleled beauty but also intelligence, courage, and wisdom. She is both open, bold, and generous, and also refined, gentle, and loving, radiating the beauty of humanity. Fulin loves her, and she loves Fulin. When Fulin chose his consort, she chose her emperor. In an era of divine right and absolute authority, she dared to "choose her perch" and "serve her master," a shocking and daring "mutual choice" that shines brightly! Wuyunzhu is not like the scheming and ambitious women in other stories, not coveting the honor and wealth of being a consort or empress, but admiring the young emperor's talents and deep affection, wishing to support him in achieving great deeds. However, such a kind and beautiful human nature was not tolerated by the feudal conservative forces, driving her to poison herself and meet a tragic end. Her death is heart-wrenching, a condemnation and accusation of ignorance, ugliness, and hypocrisy, and a praise and call for beauty and civilization!

Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang stands alongside Fulin and Wuyunzhu. She is a grand historical witness. Some historical records say: the fall of the Ming and the rise of the Qing were largely due to her efforts. Although this statement may be somewhat exaggerated, it is not entirely without merit. After the death of Huangtaiji, Fulin ascended the throne, but the central plains were not yet unified. The orphaned mother and son were able to hold onto the throne and the country, largely thanks to the regent and uncle Dorgon's assistance. Dorgon's willingness to relinquish power, not seek the throne, and dedicate himself to supporting the regime was entirely due to Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang's emotional influence. In a treacherous and complex environment, she assessed the situation, devised strategies, and acted decisively, demonstrating extraordinary skills, breadth, and dignity. This majestic and wealthy empress is as vast, deep, and mysterious as the sea, making it difficult to give her a simple moral evaluation. On stage, she also has a commanding presence, appearing more substantial than Fulin and Wuyunzhu.

Adapting a novel into a play is a form of re-creation, requiring the use of new structures, methods, and media for "reinterpretation." The success of this "reinterpretation" depends entirely on the creators' conception and the performers' execution. Notably, they neither strictly adhere to the novel nor blindly follow modern art trends. Instead, they adopt a serious and responsible creative attitude, inheriting and promoting the aesthetic spirit of opera art, widely absorbing and learning from artistic nutrients rich in contemporary flavor, and creating appropriately for the play.

"The Young Emperor" has a flexible and free time-space concept and structural form: combining points and lines, blending reality and illusion, being both fixed and fluid, concrete and abstract, having scenes yet not being segmented, with a large capacity and strong layering. The stage presentation methods of "The Young Emperor" are novel and rich, incorporating traditional programs and vocabulary, as well as using techniques such as freeze frames, flashbacks, montages, and stream-of-consciousness to enhance the sense of time and formal beauty. Director Yu Xiaoyu deserves great credit. When watching this play, one can feel the director's strong and clear intentions naturally emanating from the scenes and characters. For many years, director Yu Xiaoyu has been pursuing the aesthetic thinking of "exaggeration, distortion, vividness, and freehand brushwork," unleashing artistic imagination and creativity. Based on vertical inheritance and horizontal learning, he aims at the aesthetic tastes of contemporary audiences, continuously innovating, and striving to create a new opera with national style and national flavor. "The Young Emperor" is another successful practice of his. Of course, creating a new era of opera is a long process of exploration and accumulation. "The Young Emperor" is far from reaching its peak and still needs further refinement and polishing.

　　评曲剧《少年天子》
　　周传家
    借助于同名小说的基础，经过编剧、导演、演职员的共同创造，顺治皇帝（福临）和董鄂妃（乌云珠）那一段扑朔迷离、哀婉顽艳的爱恋传说，被搬演成一出笑有声、哭有泪，格调雅、意境美的好戏——曲剧《少年天子》。
    帝妃之恋，绝非天国里虚无飘渺的情思。福临与乌云珠之间的倾慕、爱恋和结合，除了青春容貌的吸引，气质趣味的投合外，更重要的是思想政治态度的吻合。当时，清室天下初定，四海百废待举，为图江山一统，王朝兴旺，福临在乌云珠的支持鼓舞下，意欲冲决满州祖制的某些戒律，因时制宜地推行新政，不拘一格地举贤任能。但这种顺应潮流的变革初衷并未得到朝野上下的理解和支持；反而遭到以简亲王（济度）为首的顽固势力的阻挠、诋毁和仇视。《少年天子》通过家宴风波、四阿哥被害夭亡、宗室议审、乌云珠服毒自尽等重要关目，展现并揭示了变革与守旧之间的冰火难共。在福临与乌云珠的爱情主线中，自然与巧妙地织入错综复杂的矛盾斗争，绾联了纷繁驳杂的世态人情，收笼了奇诡变幻的政治风云，避免了旧戏曲常见的容量小、思维空间狭窄、蕴涵浅薄的弱点。比起那些情节剧、纯言情剧来，《少年天子》的确高出一筹。
      《少年天子》对人物内心世界的深入发掘是颇见功力的。主人公福临承先人之余烈，六岁便登上帝王宝座，真可谓春风得意的“少年天子”。他天性风流，从小就深受汉文化的熏陶浸润，情感丰富，个性鲜明，自以为可以主宰、支配一切。但在位十载，严峻冷酷的现实磨损了他除旧布新的雄心壮志和锐气豪情，使他经常发出“想为不能为，想改不能改”，“无力展雄才”的慨叹；不时生出“深山削发拜如来”的超脱念头。在弥漫着寂寞、孤独，充满了阴谋、陷阱的险恶环境中，他的性格被扭曲，越来越专横、喜怒无常。乌云珠闯进他的生活，不禁使他怦然心动，惊喜万分，迸发出不可遏止的激情。为求知音，他的情感淹没了理智，一时间失了身份，失了常态，以万乘之尊饱尝了相思的痛苦。几经周折，乌云珠才来到他的身边，成为他血肉融合的伴侣，志同道合的股肱，给了他温馨、慰藉、力量。他情不自禁地吐出了“为了乌云珠，朕可以丢下江山”的心声。这英雄气短、儿女情长的话语，这风流自在的天性，这我行我素的行为方式，与帝王身份、王朝利益是多么格格不入！历史上的福临，就是这样一位个性极强，情感脆弱的皇帝。因为有孝庄皇太后和权臣多尔衮的辅佐，他一直在胳肢窝下过日子，终生政绩平平。比起他的先辈努尔哈赤、皇太极，晚辈康熙、乾隆来不免大为逊色。
      《少年天子》让福临走下神坛，描摹了他的性格、心态、情愫，表现了他身为帝王想做一个自由人而不可得的烦闷、焦灼、郁愤；倾吐了他知音难觅、失去幸福姻缘后的无限凄楚和绵绵长恨，塑造了一个有血有肉的帝王形象。如果编导者不是像现在这样着意地让福临负载所谓“改革的共识”的理念的话，人物将会更加自然而真实。
    可与“少年天子”平分秋色的是乌云珠。她不仅有着绝代姿容，而且秀外慧中，胆识过人。她既开朗、豪放、大度，又蕴藉、温柔、多情，闪烁着人性美的光辉。福临爱她，她也爱福临。福临选妃，她却要选皇上。在君权神授、金口玉言的时代，她竟敢“择木而栖”、“择主而事”，这种惊世骇俗的“双向选择”，多有光彩！乌云珠不是文嫣（《麟骨床》）、慈禧那样势利、贪鄙、野心勃勃的女人，不垂涎于贵妃皇后的尊荣富贵，只是仰慕少年天子的雄才大略、痴情缱绻，愿与福临知心知意，辅佐他成就一番大业。然而，这样善良、美好的人性竟为封建顽固势力所不容，逼得她饮鸩身亡，香消玉殒。她的死是凄楚动人的，是对愚昧、丑恶、虚伪的控诉和谴责，对美和文明的礼赞和呼唤！
    孝庄皇太后与福临、乌云珠鼎足而三。她是个背景宏阔的历史见证人。有的史书上说：明亡清续，实赖她一人之功。此话虽有些言过其实，却也不无几分道理。皇太极去世，福临继位，中原尚未统一。孤儿寡母所以能守住江山社稷，多亏权臣、皇叔多尔衮相助。而多尔衮之所以慨然让权，不谋王位，倾力辅佐，全赖孝庄皇太后的感情笼络。在险恶复杂的环境中，她审时度势，多谋权变，练达果断，表现出非凡的手腕、胸襟和气度。这位雍容富贵的皇太后像大海一样浩渺、深邃、神秘，很难对她进行简单的道德评价。在舞台上，她也颇有风采，显得比福临、乌云珠更为内在丰满。
    根据小说改戏是一种再创造，必须运用新的结构、手段、媒介进行“改译”。“改译”的成功与否，全赖编导者的构思和表演者的体现。难能可贵的是，他们既不恪守小说，也不盲目地学步现代派艺术，而是采取严肃认真的创作态度，继承、弘扬戏曲艺术的美学精神，广泛地吸收借鉴富有时代气息的艺术营养，因戏制宜地进行创造。
      《少年天子》的时空观念和形式结构自由而灵活：点线结合，虚实相间，既固定又流动，既具体又抽象，既有场次又非板块，包容量大，层次感强。《少年天子》的舞台表现手段新颖而丰富，既有传统的程式和语汇，又化用了定格、闪回、蒙太奇、意识流等手法，增强了时代感和形式美。导演余笑予功莫大焉。观赏此剧时，可以感到鲜明而强烈的导演意识从场面中和人物身上自然流露出来。多少年来，导演余笑予驰骋“夸张、变形、传神、写意”的美学思维，焕发出艺术想象创造力，在纵向继承横向借鉴的基础上，以当代观众的审美情趣为指向，不断进行新的综合，希图创建具有民族气派和民族韵味的新戏曲。《少年天子》是他又一次成功的实践。当然，创造一代新戏曲是个漫长的探索、积累过程，《少年天子》远还没有达到巅峰，还需要进一步推敲、锤炼。
