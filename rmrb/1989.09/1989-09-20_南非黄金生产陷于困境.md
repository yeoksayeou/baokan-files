South Africa is the world's largest producer and exporter of gold. However, in recent years, South Africa's gold production has been facing increasing difficulties.

In recent years, countries such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union have significantly increased their gold production and have a competitive edge in mining costs. For example, the United States spends only 1/6 of the funds that South Africa does on preparatory work before mining and only 1/4 of the time. With technological advancements, new management techniques and technologies are continually being applied to gold mining. For instance, the use of bacteria to extract gold from mines is a method that is both cost-effective and efficient compared to the old method of melting ore at high temperatures.

Under these circumstances, South Africa's gold exports have been steadily decreasing, from 1,000 tons in 1970 to 619 tons in 1988.

Due to the sharp increase in global gold supply and the strong U.S. dollar exchange rate, gold prices have been fluctuating downward. By the end of 1987, the average price of gold on the international market was $503 per ounce, but by the end of 1988, it had dropped to $410 per ounce, and this trend continues. This is undoubtedly a heavy blow to South Africa, where 40% of gold is used for exports.

Additionally, some of South Africa's gold mining companies have mines that are becoming increasingly deep, with the deepest reaching 2.4 miles. The cost of mining gold is continually increasing as they have to transport gold-bearing sand to the surface. Many mines that have been operating for decades have been "mined out" of gold.

Despite the fact that the gold content per ton of sand in some South African mines has decreased from 13 grams in 1970 to 5 grams currently, the authorities still prohibit the abandonment of low-grade ore layers. This forces mining companies to increase the number of miners and intensify labor to increase production, resulting in miner dissatisfaction and soaring costs. It is reported that the average cost of mining one ounce of gold in Western developed countries is $200, and some countries only need $100, while South African companies need $305. South Africa, relying on its rich gold reserves, substantial foreign capital, and especially cheap black labor, has climbed to the top of the world's gold production. However, now the South African gold throne is shaking.

### 南非黄金生产陷于困境

　　南非黄金生产陷于困境
    南非是世界上最大的黄金生产国和黄金出口国，然而，近年来南非黄金生产正遇到越来越多的困难。
    近几年美国、加拿大、巴西、澳大利亚、菲律宾和苏联等国不仅大大增加了黄金生产，而且在开采成本方面很有竞争力。如美国在开采前准备工作花费的资金只有南非的1／6，为开采所准备的时间也只有南非的1／4。随着科技的进步，新的管理新的技术不断应用于金矿生产，如用细菌从金矿中提取黄金的技术，与用高温加热熔化矿石提取黄金的老方法相比，成本低，效益高。
    在此情况下，南非黄金出口日趋减少，从1970年的1000吨降至1988年的619吨。
    由于世界黄金供应急剧增加、美元汇价坚挺等因素，金价在波动中回落。1987年底国际市场黄金价格平均每盎司为503美元，1988年底跌至410美元，而且这种势头还在继续。这对于40％黄金用于出口的南非来说，无疑是一个沉重的打击。
    此外，南非采金公司的一些矿井越挖越深，最深处达2.4英里，为了将含金沙土运上地面，采金费用不断增加。许多开采几十年的矿井，黄金已被“淘空”。
    尽管南非一些矿井每吨矿沙的含金量已从1970年的13克下降到目前的5克，但当局依然规定不准丢弃低品位矿层，迫使采金公司增加矿工数量，提高劳动强度，以增加产量，结果是矿工不满，成本也扶摇直上。据报道，西方发达国家平均每盎司黄金开采费用为200美元，有的只要100多美元，而南非公司却需要305美元。南非依仗丰富的金矿资源、雄厚的外资，特别是廉价的黑人劳动力，爬上世界金矿生产的高峰，然而现在南非黄金宝座正在摇晃。
