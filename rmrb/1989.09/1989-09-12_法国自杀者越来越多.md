	France's suicide rate is on the rise. According to recent statistics released by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, France sees over 12,000 suicides annually, with an average of 21 suicides per 100,000 people. Among those aged 15-24, the suicide rate has reached a record high. Additionally, there are approximately 120,000 attempted suicides each year.

	Over the past decade, the number of suicides in France has been increasing year by year. According to psychological experts, the reasons are varied, but unemployment is a significant factor.

	Furthermore, many suicides occur among individuals who do not have a stable family environment. Domestic discord, separation, and divorce bring psychological and economic difficulties, particularly for women and children.

	Drug abuse, alcoholism, and the influence of certain films and television programs that glorify suicide are also contributing factors. However, the French newspaper "L'Humanité" pointed out on the 11th that capitalism is the root cause of France's unemployment, drug abuse, poverty, social insecurity, and corruption.

　　法国自杀者越来越多
    据法国全国统计及经济研究所最近公布的统计数字，法国每年自杀者超过1.2万人，平均每10万人中就有21人自杀，其中15—24岁的青年人的自杀率达到了创纪录的数字。另外，每年有自杀企图的人还有约12万人。
    最近10年来，法国的自杀人数逐年增多，据心理专家分析，原因虽然是多种多样的，但遭受失业的打击是一大原因。
  其次，自杀者一般都没有一个良好的家庭环境。家庭不睦、分居、离婚给许多人带来了精神上和经济上的痛苦和困难，尤其是妇女和儿童。
    另外，吸毒、酗酒和受某些电影电视上宣扬自杀的影响，也是一部分人自杀的原因。但法国《人道报》11日在一篇文章中一针见血地指出，资本主义制度才是造成法国失业、吸毒、贫困化、社会不安全、腐化等弊病的真正根源。（据新华社）
