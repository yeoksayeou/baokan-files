Today, the Military Appearance and Discipline Traffic Safety Committee of the Capital Garrison held a meeting at the National Defense University, calling on all units stationed in Beijing to present a new image to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the Asian Games. Deputy Chief of the General Staff He Qizong gave an important speech on further implementing the instructions of the Military Commission and deeply addressing the issue of lax discipline.

From January to August this year, according to the Military Appearance and Discipline Traffic Safety Committee of the Capital Garrison, the qualification rate of military appearance and discipline in the Capital Garrison increased by 6.76% compared to the same period last year. Military vehicle traffic safety work, compared to the same period last year, saw a 5.4% reduction in traffic accidents. Troops executing martial law tasks maintained strict management and discipline in extremely difficult conditions, demonstrating the image of a formidable and civilized army, and received praise from party and state leaders as well as the general public. However, there are still instances of untidy military appearance, improper behavior, lax management, and disorder in some units.

Regarding this, Deputy Chief He emphasized the importance, long-term nature, and arduousness of addressing lax discipline, and called for further strengthening the leadership of rectification work. Before and after National Day, key inspections should be conducted on units in Beijing, and any issues found, whether in the headquarters, major units in Beijing, or units outside Beijing, must be corrected decisively. All units in Beijing should strictly demand and resolve to improve military appearance and discipline, presenting a new image and appearance to bring glory to the capital and the People's Liberation Army.

    以崭新面貌迎国庆迎亚运
    首都驻军抓军容风纪
    本报北京9月9日讯　今天，首都驻军军容风纪交通安全委员会在国防大学召开现场会，号召所有驻京部队以崭新的面貌迎接建国40周年和亚运会的召开。何其宗副总参谋长就全军进一步贯彻落实军委指示，深入治理松散问题作了重要讲话。
    今年1至8月，据首都驻军军容风纪交通安全委员会检查，首都驻军军容风纪合格率比去年同期上升了6.76％。军车交通安全工作与去年同期相比，交通事故下降5.4％。执行戒严任务的部队在极端困难的情况下，坚持严格管理，严格要求，纪律严明，展示了威武之师、文明之师的风貌，受到党和国家领导人以及广大人民群众的赞扬。但是，军人军容不整、举止不端、管理不严、秩序混乱的现象在一些单位仍然存在。
    对此，何副总长强调，要加深认识治理松散的重要性、长期性和艰巨性，进一步加强对治理整顿工作的领导。国庆节前后，对驻京单位要有重点地进行抽查，发现问题，不论是总部机关、驻京大单位的，还是京外单位的，都要坚决纠正。驻京各单位要严格要求，下决心把军容风纪搞好，以崭新的形象和面貌，为首都争光，为人民解放军争光。
