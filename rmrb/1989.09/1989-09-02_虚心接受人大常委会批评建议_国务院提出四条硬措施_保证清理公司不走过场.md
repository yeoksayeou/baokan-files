Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 2nd.

The opinions and suggestions of the members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the cleanup and rectification of companies have been highly valued by the leaders of the State Council. At yesterday's State Council executive meeting, Premier Li Peng said: The criticisms and opinions raised by the members are a support and a promotion for the cleanup and rectification of companies. The State Council will seriously listen to the opinions of the members, accept the supervision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and ensure that this work is done well.

The ongoing ninth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress heard a report on August 29th from Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, regarding the situation of the cleanup and rectification of companies. During the deliberation, the members raised many sharp criticisms and constructive suggestions for further improving the cleanup and rectification of companies.

The State Council executive meeting, based on the proposal of Premier Li Peng, adopted four specific measures for further improving the cleanup and rectification of companies:

- To strengthen organizational leadership, according to the recent decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, a national leading group for the cleanup and rectification of companies will be established, and the strength of the office will be reinforced and enhanced.

- The cleanup and rectification of companies will start from the State Council, and the companies under the State Council and various departments will be resolutely cleaned up and rectified. How to invite representatives of the National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and members of democratic parties to participate in this work will be specifically discussed with relevant departments after the leading group is formally approved and established.

- According to the policy boundaries determined in the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the leading group for the cleanup and rectification of companies will conduct reviews and strictly control the process. Companies that should be merged will be decisively merged, and those that should be retained will be decisively retained. The focus will be on eliminating companies run by party and government organs, and companies that are too numerous, disorderly, and chaotic in the circulation sector.

- According to the new requirements proposed in the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on further cleanup and rectification of companies, this work will continue to be pushed forward and will be carried out to the end, without just going through the motions.

On the day the State Council executive meeting ended, the General Office of the State Council sent these four measures to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Chairman Wan Li believes that the State Council's attitude towards the criticisms and suggestions raised by the members is serious and responsible. According to his opinion, these four measures were read out at the group meeting this morning. The members responded strongly, saying that the State Council's attention to the opinions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has increased our confidence, given us hope, and demonstrated the progress of China's democratic and legal system.

    虚心接受人大常委会批评建议
    国务院提出四条硬措施  保证清理公司不走过场
    新华社北京9月2日电  （记者何平）全国人大常委会委员对清理整顿公司的意见和建议引起了国务院领导同志的高度重视。李鹏总理在昨天召开的国务院常务会议上表示：委员们提出的批评和意见，对清理整顿公司是个支持，也是个促进。国务院要认真听取委员们的意见，接受人大常委会的监督，切实把这项工作做好。
    正在举行的七届全国人大常委会第九次会议，8月29日听取了国家工商行政管理局局长任中林关于清理整顿公司的情况汇报。委员们在审议时，对进一步搞好清理整顿公司工作提出了许多尖锐的批评和建设性意见。
    国务院常务会议根据李鹏总理的提议，通过了关于进一步搞好清理整顿公司的4条具体措施：
    ——为了加强组织领导，根据最近中共中央、国务院的决定，成立全国清理整顿公司领导小组，并充实和加强了办公室的力量。
    ——清理整顿公司首先从国务院做起，对国务院和国务院各部门所属的公司，下决心清理整顿好。在清理整顿中如何请人大代表、政协委员、民主党派成员参加这项工作，将在领导小组正式批准成立后与有关部门具体商定。
    ——按照中共中央、国务院决定中确定的政策界限，由清理整顿公司领导小组进行审查，严格把关，该撤并的坚决撤并，该保留的坚决保留。重点是砍掉党政机关开办的公司，流通领域中过多、过滥、过乱的公司。
    ——根据中共中央、国务院关于进一步清理整顿公司决定中新提出的要求，这项工作还要继续抓紧进行，要一抓到底，决不走过场。
    国务院常务会议结束当天，国务院办公厅将这四项措施函告全国人大常委会。万里委员长认为，国务院对待委员们提出的批评、建议态度是认真的、严肃的。根据他的意见，今天上午在小组会上宣读了这四项措施。委员们对此反映强烈，认为国务院这样重视人大常委会的意见，使我们增强了信心，看到了希望，体现了我国民主与法制建设的进步。
