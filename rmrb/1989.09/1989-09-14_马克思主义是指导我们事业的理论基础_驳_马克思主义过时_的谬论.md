One of the arguments of the "outdated" theory is that Marxism is merely a "cultural phenomenon of the 19th century," and it can no longer explain the issues of contemporary capitalism and socialism. Indeed, since the emergence of Marxism over a hundred years ago, the global political and economic landscape has undergone tremendous changes, particularly with contemporary capitalism and socialism experiencing many new developments and trends. However, it must be recognized that the various changes, big or small, in contemporary capitalism are merely superficial. They have not and cannot alter the nature and fundamental characteristics of capitalism. The contradiction between the socialization of production and private ownership under capitalism remains the basic contradiction of capitalism, which capitalism itself cannot resolve. Similarly, although socialist countries have implemented reforms in their economic and political systems and actively explored the specific forms of public ownership and distribution according to work, the fundamental characteristics of socialism, such as public ownership and distribution according to work, have not fundamentally changed. Therefore, the basic principles of Marxism remain a sharp weapon for us to analyze contemporary capitalism and socialism today. Moreover, in the process of combining with revolutionary practice, Marxism has given rise to Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have further deepened the understanding of capitalism and socialism, and their scientific principles more powerfully refute the "outdated" theory.

Another argument of the "outdated" theory is that Marxism is only a revolutionary doctrine, not a theory of construction, and cannot guide the modernization of socialism. Marxism is not only a revolutionary doctrine but also a theory of construction. Although in different historical periods, Marxism faces different main tasks and focuses on different social aspects, the tasks of revolution and construction are always presented simultaneously. Breaking down the old world and building a new world are always treated as two aspects of the same thing and given equal attention. The classical writers before Lenin had proposed overall visions and basic principles for the socialist society after the proletariat seizes power. Since Lenin, the construction theory of Marxism has been greatly enriched and developed. In fact, Marxism is first and foremost a complete worldview and a scientific methodology. It established the basic principles of revolution and also the basic principles of construction, and these are our guides to action.

A third argument of the "outdated" theory is to downgrade Marxism to one of the "hundred schools of thought," thereby denying the guiding role and function of Marxism. Although Marxism, in its formation and development, has absorbed beneficial elements from the "hundred schools" of social and natural sciences, it differs fundamentally from these "hundred schools" once it was born. Firstly, it has become the spiritual weapon for the proletariat and the broad masses of the people to strive for liberation. This is something that no other school can match. The victories of the revolutions in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and the great achievements in socialist construction in these countries, were not all achieved under the guidance of Marxism? Secondly, Marxism reveals the most general laws of the development of nature and human society, providing people with the most general methods for understanding and transforming the world. The worldview and methodology it provides are irreplaceable in guiding individuals, groups, and other disciplines. This has already been proven by practice.

### 马克思主义是指导我们事业的理论基础——驳“马克思主义过时”的谬论

　　马克思主义是指导我们事业的理论基础
　　——驳“马克思主义过时”的谬论
　　李础
      “过时论”的论点之一，就是认为马克思主义不过是“十九世纪的一种文化现象”，用它已经不能解释当代资本主义和社会主义的问题了。的确，马克思主义产生以来的一百多年中，世界政治经济形势发生了巨大变化，特别是当代资本主义和当代社会主义在发展中出现了许多新情况、新趋势。但是，必须看到，当代资本主义发生的各种各样、或大或小的变化，都只是形式上的变化，没有也不可能改变资本主义的性质和根本特征。生产的社会化和资本主义的私人占有的矛盾，仍然是资本主义的基本矛盾。这个矛盾，资本主义本身无法克服。同样，社会主义国家尽管实行经济、政治体制上的改革，积极探索公有制和按劳分配的具体实现形式，但公有制、按劳分配等社会主义基本特征并没有从根本上改变。因此，马克思主义的基本原理今天仍然是我们分析当代资本主义和社会主义的锐利武器。况且，马克思主义在与革命实践相结合的过程中，产生了列宁主义，产生了毛泽东思想。列宁主义和毛泽东思想又把对资本主义和社会主义的认识进一步深刻化，它的科学原理更有力地驳斥了“过时论”。
      “过时论”的论点之二，就是攻击马克思主义只是革命学说，而不是建设理论，不能指导社会主义现代化建设。马克思主义不仅仅是革命的学说，而且是建设的理论。尽管在不同的历史时期，马克思主义面临的主要任务不同、关注的社会重点不同，但革命和建设的任务总是同时提出来的，打破旧世界和建设新世界总是被当作一个事物的两个方面被给予重视。列宁以前的经典作家，对无产阶级夺取政权后的社会主义社会提出过总体的设想和基本的原则。自列宁以后，马克思主义的建设学说得到极大的丰富和发展。事实上，马克思主义首先是完整的世界观和科学的方法论，它创立了革命的基本原理，也创立了建设的基本原理，而这都是我们的行动指南。
      “过时论”的论点之三，就是把马克思主义贬低为“百家争鸣”中的一家，以此来否定马克思主义的指导地位和作用。马克思主义在其形成和发展的过程中，虽然吸收了社会科学和自然科学“百家”的有益的东西，但它一经诞生，就与这“百家”有根本的不同了。首先，它成为无产阶级和广大人民群众争取解放的精神武器。这是任何其他一家都不能比拟的。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家革命的胜利，这些国家社会主义建设的伟大成就，不都是在马克思主义指导下取得的吗？其次，马克思主义揭示了自然界和人类社会发展的最一般规律，给人们提供了认识世界和改造世界的最一般的方法。它所提供的世界观和方法论，无论对个体、群体以及其它各类学科都具有无法替代的指导作用。这也已经是为实践所证明了的。
