The eagerly awaited National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Awards Conference, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of our nation and the 10th anniversary of reform, has grandly opened in the capital today! This conference is not only a review of the achievements of the past 40 years, especially the past 10 years of reform, but also a rally to maintain social stability, strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and inspire the people of the nation to rally their spirits under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee to achieve the goals of rectification and deepening reform. We extend our warm congratulations to the conference.

Every era needs its heroes. Our Party has always valued the propaganda and education of revolutionary heroism. Revolutionary heroism, like a radiant banner, has always inspired the people of all ethnic groups in our country to forge ahead, enabling our nation to withstand wars and setbacks and rise again. The history of modern Chinese revolution is the history of countless Chinese sons and daughters, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, displaying unprecedented revolutionary heroism, sacrificing their lives and shedding blood to save China. It is with this spirit that our Party, armed with little more than rice and rifles, defeated the Kuomintang regime backed by dollars and cannons, and established the New China. This great feat showed the world the invincible strength of the Chinese nation.

During the period of socialist construction, revolutionary heroism has also been a powerful spiritual force for us to overcome all difficulties and forge ahead. In the 1950s, our Party vigorously called on people to learn from Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang, and in the 1960s, it called on people to learn from Lei Feng and Jiao Yulu. During the periods of economic recovery and temporary difficulties, a large number of advanced model figures represented by Meng Tai and Wang Jianxin emerged, becoming role models for a generation and greatly inspiring and encouraging the enthusiasm, creativity, and courage of hundreds of millions of people to overcome difficulties. This revolutionary heroism had a significant impact on the formation of people's worldviews at that time, especially among the younger generation, and it continues to have an effect today. This can be seen in the positive attitudes of today's middle-aged and elderly workers towards the Party, socialism, their careers, and life.

Today, our country has entered the great era of reform and opening up, and a new batch of heroic models with the characteristics of the 1980s are emerging. This grand gathering of heroes honors 1,988 national labor models and 805 advanced workers, who are outstanding representatives of the numerous advanced model figures that have emerged on various fronts since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Among them, some have worked for many years in harsh industries or on the production front lines, persevering and enduring hardships without complaint, possessing not only lofty moral qualities and a strong sense of ownership but also superb professional skills and good work ethics; some have made outstanding contributions to the development of agricultural production and the revitalization of the rural economy, serving as leaders for the broad masses of farmers in their efforts to work hard and get rich, and in building rural material and spiritual civilization; some have struggled and striven to scale new heights, making outstanding contributions to the development of science and technology and the modernization of national defense, bringing honor to the motherland; some have been exemplary teachers, dedicating themselves to teaching and nurturing talents, cultivating a large number of outstanding talents for China's modernization; some have been innovative and pioneering, achieving remarkable results in developing production, improving management, and enhancing economic and social benefits; some have stood firm and clear in the struggle to stop turmoil and suppress counter-revolutionary riots, making significant contributions to the defense of national and people's interests... They all share a common characteristic: they firmly believe in the leadership of the Communist Party, steadfastly walk the socialist path, and have unwavering confidence in reform and opening up. They have not only created immense material wealth for society and the people but also created immense spiritual wealth in building socialist spiritual civilization and purifying social customs. They are the backbone of socialist revolution and construction, and the spirit of hard work, selfless dedication, innovation, and revolutionary heroism they embody is worthy of emulation by all ethnic groups in the nation.

In recent years, although we have propagated and honored some advanced model figures, the overall effort has been weak, lacking focus, continuity, and appeal, failing to create an impact. The reason is that for a period, due to the ideological mistakes of Zhao Ziyang, economic development was emphasized while ideological and political work was neglected, downplaying the propaganda of advanced model figures. Some stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization, while glorifying Western capitalism, relentlessly slandered and attacked our socialist system, denying the Party's fine traditions and styles. This caused confusion in people's minds, especially among young people who have not yet experienced much of the world, and had a very harmful influence. Some people mistakenly believe that in this era of reform and opening up, "there are no heroes, only practical benefits"; others think that the spirit of self-sacrifice from the war years is outdated, and that emphasizing heroic self-sacrifice is unscientific and reckless. Some leaders complain that the masses are backward, unwilling to learn from or become advanced; some masses complain that the leaders are rigid, still promoting these "empty gestures" in the 1980s. Even some advanced model figures themselves are unwilling to be propagated. This is a very abnormal phenomenon. The responsibility lies with the leadership, which has been the result of a period of devaluing and weakening ideological and political work. This situation cannot continue.

Any country with any system needs to establish its own ideal figures to serve its ideology, thoughts, and economic foundations. As a socialist country, we should even more vigorously honor advanced model figures, propagate socialism, and propagate revolutionary heroism. If we do not do this, we cannot inspire the advanced and educate the people. The revolutionary heroism we advocate is the unity of fearless heroism and a scientific attitude and practical spirit, with a deep mass foundation. A country needs public morale, an army needs fighting spirit, and a person needs personal integrity. The "three spirits" we advocate are revolutionary heroism. Now our country is in a new historical period, and the great task of revitalizing China and achieving the Four Modernizations more urgently needs us to overcome difficulties and obstacles with fearless heroism and unyielding struggle. Not only in the complex and arduous reforms in various fields such as politics and economics, but also in the development of science, technology, culture, and education, and in raising the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation, we need to greatly advocate this spirit. With the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, we must be soberly aware that while the influence of socialism is expanding outward, capitalist thoughts and the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie are inevitably infiltrating. In this situation, if we relax the propaganda of socialism, communism, and revolutionary heroism, and neglect the exemplary power of heroic models, then the decadent and declining elements of capitalism will take advantage of the situation and spread freely, poisoning people's souls. Therefore, our leaders at all levels should, around one central task and two fundamental points, carefully cultivate and vigorously support the advanced model figures emerging from the masses, wholeheartedly care for and cherish them, fully play their leading, backbone, and bridging roles in reform and construction, and give necessary rewards for their major contributions, with some specific regulations and methods. Those who are jealous of talent, arbitrarily distort, slander, and harass advanced model figures must be firmly corrected. Of course, advanced model figures should also correctly treat the honors given to them by the Party, government, and the people, and turn these honors into great momentum to drive themselves to new heights, while enthusiastically helping those who lag behind to advance together. We should create a good atmosphere in society where everyone learns from heroes and strives to be advanced. Our Party has a fine tradition of advocating revolutionary heroism education. We should seriously summarize historical experiences and lessons, making the propaganda of advanced model figures and revolutionary heroism a powerful driving force for building socialist undertakings.

Let more heroic models with unique styles shine brightly on the land of China!

Salute to the labor models and advanced workers!

### 弘扬革命英雄主义精神——热烈祝贺全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会开幕

    弘扬革命英雄主义精神
    ——热烈祝贺全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会开幕
    我国各族人民盼望已久的全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会，今天在首都隆重开幕了！这次大会既是检阅建国40年、特别是改革10年成就的大会，也是维护社会稳定，加强社会主义精神文明建设，激励全国人民振奋精神，在党中央的坚强领导下，为完成治理整顿、深化改革目标的一个动员大会。我们谨向大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    任何一个时代都需要自己的英雄人物。我们党历来重视革命英雄主义的宣传和教育。革命英雄主义犹如一面光辉的旗帜，一直鼓舞着我国各族人民奋勇前进，使我们的国家历经战乱而不败亡，屡遭挫折而能奋起。一部中国现代革命史，就是成千成万的中华儿女在中国共产党的领导下，以前所未有的革命英雄气概，抛头颅，洒热血，拯救中华的奋斗史。正是凭着这么一种精神，我们党终于以小米加步枪打败了美元加大炮的蒋家王朝，建立了社会主义新中国。这一伟大壮举，让全世界看到了中华民族不可征服的伟大力量。
    社会主义建设时期，革命英雄主义同样是我们排除万难、开拓前进的强大精神力量。五十年代，我们党大张旗鼓地号召人们学习董存瑞、黄继光，六十年代又号召人们学习雷锋、焦裕禄。在恢复国民经济和国民经济遇到暂时困难的时期，涌现了以孟泰、王铁人为代表的一大批先进模范人物，成为一代人的楷模，极大地鼓舞和激励了亿万人民的积极性、创造性和战胜困难的勇气。这种革命英雄主义对当时的人们，特别是青年一代的人生观的形成产生了重大的影响，而且至今仍在起作用。这从当时的青年——今天的中老年职工对党、对社会主义、对事业和人生的积极态度上可以得到雄辩的证明。
    今天，我国已进入改革开放的伟大时代，一大批具有80年代特色的新的英雄模范人物正在涌现出来。这次群英盛会表彰的1988名全国劳动模范和805名先进工作者，就是党的十一届三中全会以来我国各条战线涌现出来的无数先进模范人物的杰出代表。他们当中，有的长年工作在艰苦行业或生产第一线，顽强奋斗，任劳任怨，不但具有崇高的思想品质、强烈的主人翁意识，而且具有高超的业务技能和良好的职业道德；有的在发展农业生产和搞活农村经济方面贡献突出，是广大农民勤劳致富、建设农村物质文明和精神文明的带头人；有的奋力拚搏，勇攀高峰，为我国科学技术的发展和国防现代化作出卓越成绩，为祖国争得了荣誉；有的为人师表，呕心沥血，教书育人，为我国现代化建设培养了大批优秀人才；有的锐意改革，开拓创新，在发展生产，改善经营管理，提高经济效益和社会效益方面成绩卓著；有的在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，为保卫国家和人民利益做出重大贡献……他们都有一个共同的特点：就是坚信共产党的领导，坚定地走社会主义道路，对改革开放抱有坚定不移的信心，不仅为社会和人民创造了巨大的物质财富，也在建设社会主义精神文明、净化社会风气方面创造了巨大的精神财富。他们是社会主义革命和建设的骨干，他们身上所体现的艰苦奋斗精神、无私奉献精神、开拓创新精神、革命英雄主义精神，值得全国各族人民学习。
    这些年我们虽也宣传表彰了一些先进模范人物，但总的是宣传不力，重点不突出，缺乏连续性，缺乏号召力，引不起震动。其原因是，一个时期以来，由于赵紫阳同志指导思想上的失误，抓经济一手硬，抓思想政治工作一手软，淡化了对先进模范人物的宣传。一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人在极力美化西方资本主义的同时，拚命地诋毁、攻击我们的社会主义制度，否定党的优良传统和作风。这就造成人们思想上的混乱，特别是对涉世未深的青年人产生极为有害的影响。有的人错误地认为，现在是开放改革的年代，“不讲英雄，讲实惠”；也有的认为，战争年代那种拚命精神早已过时，再强调勇于自我牺牲的英雄主义，就是不讲科学的蛮干，等等。一些领导埋怨群众落后，不愿学先进，不愿当先进；一些群众则抱怨领导思想僵化，八十年代还搞这些“花架子”。甚至连一些先进模范人物本人也不愿意宣传自己。这是一种很不正常的现象。其责任在领导，是一个时期以来贬低和削弱思想政治工作酿成的后果。这种情况再也不能继续下去了。
    世界上任何一种制度的国家，都需要树立自己的理想人物，来为自己的主义、思想和经济基础服务。我们是社会主义国家，更应该大力表彰先进模范人物，宣传社会主义，宣传革命英雄主义。如果不是这样，就不能鼓舞先进，教育人民。我们所说的革命英雄主义，是大无畏的英雄气概和科学态度、求实精神的统一，是有着深厚的群众基础的。一个国家要有民气，一个队伍要有士气，一个人要有志气，我们提倡的这“三股气”就是革命英雄主义。现在我们国家正处在一个历史发展的新时期，振兴中华，实现四化的宏伟任务更需要我们以大无畏的英雄气概，坚韧不拔的奋斗精神，去克服困难，战胜险阻。不仅在政治、经济等各个领域进行艰巨而复杂的改革需要这种精神，在发展科学技术和文化教育事业、提高全民族科学文化水平上，同样需要大大提倡这种精神。随着改革开放政策的执行，我们应当清醒地看到，一方面是社会主义的影响对外不断扩大，另一方面是资本主义思想、资产阶级腐朽的生活方式难免传进来。在这种情况下，我们如果放松对社会主义、共产主义和革命英雄主义的宣传，忽视英雄模范人物榜样的力量，那么资本主义那一套腐朽、没落的东西就会乘虚而入、自由泛滥，毒害人们的灵魂。因此，我们的各级领导，要围绕一个中心、两个基本点，精心培养和大力扶植群众中涌现的先进模范人物，满腔热情地关心和爱护先进模范人物，充分发挥他们在改革和建设中的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，对他们作出的重大贡献要给予必要的奖励，要有一些具体的规定和办法。对那些嫉贤妒能，任意歪曲、诽谤、刁难打击先进模范人物的歪风邪气，要坚决地予以纠正。当然，先进模范人物也应当正确对待党、政府和人民群众给予自己的荣誉，并把这种荣誉化为巨大的动力，推动自己朝着新的高度奋飞，同时热情地帮助那些落在后边的同志，带动他们一道前进。我们要在全社会造成一种人人学英雄，个个争先进的良好风气。我们党富有抓革命英雄主义教育的优良传统，我们要认真总结历史经验教训，使先进模范人物和革命英雄主义的宣传，成为建设社会主义事业的强大推动力量。
    让更多的各具风采的英雄模范人物在神州大地上大显身手、大放异彩吧！
    向劳动模范和先进工作者们致敬！
