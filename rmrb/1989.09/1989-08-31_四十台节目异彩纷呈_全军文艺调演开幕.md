The military arts festival, held to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, recently opened in Beijing. A large number of newly created artistic works from various military regions, military branches, and direct-affiliated art troupes of the General Political Department, as well as the Academy of Military Arts, will be showcased in the capital. The festival is organized by the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

In the past few days, several performances that have taken the stage have garnered significant attention from the evaluation committee, composed of famous military artists from various regions, and the audience in the capital. Examples include the Beijing Military Region's "Song and Dance Troupe's 'Wind from Taihang,'" the General Political Department's "Song and Dance Troupe's 'Ah! Red Star,'" the General Political Department's "Drama Troupe's 'China, 1949,'" the Air Force's "Song and Dance 'Melody of the Blue Sky,'" and the Navy's "Song and Dance 'Emotions for the South China Sea,'" all of which have received widespread acclaim.

A total of 40 programs are participating in this festival, including 11 plays, 22 musical and dance performances, 1 Peking opera, and 6 variety shows. It is reported that some of the programs in the festival will participate in the second China Art Festival.
