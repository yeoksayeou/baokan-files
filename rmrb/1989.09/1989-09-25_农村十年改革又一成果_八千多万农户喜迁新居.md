After solving the problem of basic sustenance through reform, the housing construction in China's vast rural areas is becoming the largest consumer trend. Over the past 10 years, a total of 6.2 billion square meters of housing has been built, which is twice the total of the previous 30 years.

In the past 10 years, 86 million rural households have moved into new homes, accounting for 43.7% of the total number of rural households in the country. The per capita housing area for Chinese farmers has reached 19.4 square meters.

In 1988, the national investment in rural housing construction reached 6.11 billion yuan, an increase of 20 times compared to 1978.

The quality of new rural housing has also improved. In 1988, 85% of the newly built houses were brick and wood structures; multi-story buildings have emerged like mushrooms after rain, accounting for 36% of the total; even in impoverished areas, the living conditions of newly built earthen houses and caves have been improved.

    农村十年改革又一成果
    八千多万农户喜迁新居
    据新华社北京9月23日电  （记者李安定）在改革中解决了温饱问题的我国广大农村，住房建设正为最大消费趋势。近10年来共建住房62亿平方米，相当于前30年总和的两倍。
    近10年来，全国有8600万户农民迁入了新居，占全国农户总数的43.7％。我国农民人均住房面积已达19.4平方米。
    1988年全国农村用于住房建设的投资达611亿元，比1978年增长20倍。
    农村新建住房的质量也有了提高。1988年新建住房中砖木结构的房屋占85％；楼房如雨后春笋般出现，占到总数的36％；贫困地区新建的土坯房和窑洞，在居住条件上也有了改善。
