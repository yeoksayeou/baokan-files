Consumption is an important link in the process of social reproduction. Professor Yin Shijie of Xiangtan University and the Institute of Consumption Economics he heads have done a lot of beneficial work in recent years to strengthen research in this important area. Following the publication of his edited volume "Socialist Consumption Economics" in 1983, he has recently edited another book, "Research on China's Consumption Structure," published by Shanghai People's Publishing House.

"Research on China's Consumption Structure" is currently the most systematic academic monograph on the study of consumption structure in our country. The book not only adheres to the dialectical principle that production determines consumption and consumption reacts back on production, but also conducts a thorough analysis of the hierarchical, transitional, and differential nature of consumption structure; it not only provides a specialized discussion on consumption structure but also links it with industrial structure, demand structure, supply structure, and even social structure for a comprehensive examination. The authors, centering on the establishment of a theoretical framework for consumption economic structure, have developed some unique categories and concepts. After analyzing the mutual relationships between income, price, population, and changes in consumption structure, the book proposes the hierarchical and developmental laws of macro-level consumption structure types for our country.

How to establish a theoretical system for consumption structure? The book conducts research and exploration on this issue. The authors systematically and comprehensively construct the entire theoretical framework of consumption structure, with a series of basic categories forming an organic combination based on their internal connections. The problems discussed are closely linked and progressively deepened. The book starts from the study of consumption demand, then analyzes the factors influencing consumption structure, elucidates the types of consumption structure, predicts the trends of changes in consumption structure, explores the rationalization of consumption structure, and on this basis, makes predictions about China's consumption structure. It points out the need to adjust the industrial structure according to the changes and development of consumption structure to better meet the needs of the people, thus achieving the unity of the logical starting point and the endpoint.

This book has a strong sense of reality. The authors adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, closely linking the actual situation of China's economic reform and development, from history to reality, from macro to micro, from abroad to domestic, conducting in-depth and comprehensive research on the theoretical and practical issues of consumption structure in the primary stage of socialism. It is not a simple transition from one book to another, but starts from the living reality, analyzing the actual situation of consumption structure that is most closely related to people's lives, most common, and most general, and then proceeds to abstraction and synthesis, proposing a series of scientific categories and theories related to consumption structure. This makes the entire book both theoretically profound and strongly realistic. Currently, curbing the expansion of consumption demand and establishing a reasonable consumption structure have become urgent issues in real economic life. In this context, reading this book, we can gain many beneficial enlightenments.

    《中国消费结构研究》评介
    萧体焕
    消费是社会再生产过程的一个重要环节。湘潭大学尹世杰教授及其主持的消费经济研究所，近些年为加强这一重要环节的研究做了许多有益的工作。继一九八三年出版他主编的《社会主义消费经济学》之后，新近他又主编了《中国消费结构研究》一书，由上海人民出版社出版。
      《中国消费结构研究》是目前我国一部系统地研究消费结构的学术专著。该书不仅坚持了生产决定消费，消费反作用于生产的辩证原理，而且对消费结构的层次性、过渡性、差异性进行了透彻的分析；不仅对消费结构做了专门论述，而且把它和产业结构、需求结构、供应结构，乃至社会结构联系起来，进行了综合的考察。作者围绕建立消费经济结构的理论框架，建立和形成了一些特有的范畴和概念。该书在分析收入、价格、人口与消费结构变动的相互关系后，对我国消费结构类型差异发展，提出了消费结构宏观类型发展的层次态规律。
    消费结构理论体系怎样建立？该书进行了研究和探索。作者系统而全面地构造了整个消费结构的理论框架，一系列基本范畴按其内在联系形成了有机组合，并且对所论述的问题是环环紧扣，层层深入。全书从研究消费需求出发，接着分析影响消费结构的因素，阐明消费结构的类型，预测消费结构变化的趋势，探讨消费结构合理化，然后在此基础上，作出对我国消费结构的预测，指出必须根据消费结构的变化发展来调整产业结构，以便更好地满足人民需要，从而达到逻辑起点与归宿点的统一。
    这部书具有浓郁的现实性。作者坚持求实精神，紧密联系我国经济改革与经济发展的实际，从历史到现实，从宏观到微观，从国外到国内，对我国社会主义初级阶段消费结构的理论问题与实际问题，进行了深入、全面的研究。它不是简单地从书本到书本，而是从活生生的实际出发，从分析与人民生活最密切、最常见、最一般的消费结构的实际状况入手，最后进行抽象、综合，提出一系列有关消费结构的科学范畴和理论，从而使全书既有一定的理论深度，又有强烈的现实感。当前，抑制消费需求膨胀，建立合理的消费结构，已成为现实经济生活急待解决的课题，在这种情况下阅读此书，我们能得到许多有益的启迪。
