Films about teenagers should be lively and refreshing, enjoyable to watch, and should also allow a new generation to experience and understand a bit of the taste of life. This is the artistic pursuit of films like "The Season of Dreams," "The Pleasureville Company," and the recently released "The Age of Innocence," and they have achieved commendable results.

Compared to these, the literary script of "The Age of Innocence" is more in the mold of a school drama. It mainly depicts the life of a boarding middle school, with scenes concentrated in a high school girls' dormitory. This easily reminds one of a similar film, "The Female College Dormitory," with the only difference being between a university and a middle school. It should be said that it is the director's artistic re-creation that has effectively brought out the script's intellectual content, using smooth, innovative, and flexible cinematic techniques to recreate a segment of colorful and intriguing middle school life. This shows that with equal literary scripts, a director's careful exploration and hard work can lead to even greater heights.

The essence of film art is people. The scarcity and weakness of teenage screen images remain a major challenge in creation. We have yet to have a contemporary teenage character as vivid as "Little Soldier Zha Gha." "The Age of Innocence" portrays a group of middle school students, and individually, each character still has its flaws. However, these female students' group image, especially the city girl Cao Mimi and the rural girl Yao Xiaohuo, complement each other, each adding their own color. For example, although they have different personalities and preferences, they share an exceptionally close friendship. It is only when Cao Mimi is unexpectedly injured and hospitalized that Yao Xiaohuo focuses entirely on her studies, neglecting the attention her close friend desperately needs. This illustrates to the younger generation that even in fierce competition for survival, one should not forget to love and care for others. Adolescence is the most vibrant period of life, and the interactions among classmates are particularly frequent. The film's choice of such a plot to depict the two female students' images indeed has a "kill two birds with one stone" artistic effect. Adult figures in this film are not extensively depicted, but some are quite charming. For instance, the teacher Li, who always turns his back to the camera and works silently all his life; the elderly female dormitory manager who never lets go of her bunch of keys, etc. The director has emphasized these details and visual effects, providing the youth with a respectable and lovable adult world.

The tastes, preferences, and needs of today's new generation for film viewing have undergone various new changes. "The Season of Dreams" intentionally extends poetic life philosophy from the basis of real life, which is commendable. However, there is still a trace of artificiality. "The Pleasureville Company" and "The Age of Innocence" have taken another step forward, allowing the audience to freely experience the various meanings of life from different characters and life scenes.

In terms of structure, the film has broken away from the conventional single-plot narrative model and adopted a multi-threaded, interwoven form. This makes it seem more open, free, and lively. Naturally, the focus and center are still on this group of female students. Their threads and lines are clear and consistent, while from these, the life scene expands to society, the Cultural Revolution, and overseas. This multi-threaded, interwoven open structure allows the audience's vision to see not just a dormitory or a school, but a glimpse of a society and a world. It is worth mentioning that in addition to adopting clear and specific plot lines, some also use suggestive and implied presentation methods. For example, someone sends a telegram to Yao Xiaohuo before the international high school mathematics competition, falsely stating that her mother is critically ill, but the film never reveals who did this, leaving the audience with a suspenseful guess. This real and unreal, clear and obscure plot structure is engaging and novel.

"The Age of Innocence" also has a rich and varied life color. For example, the scene where the female students in the dormitory simulate a "fashion show" is shot with flexible angles, lively images, and reflects a group of innocent and lovable girls' yearning for modern life and beauty, although it seems a bit too romantic. Again, the introduction and appearance of the character Gai Ping create a contrast and difference between the severity of life and the leisure of the school, also changing the film's overly pure tone. Additionally, the entire film has a beautiful and uplifting artistic style. Shrubs, stone paths, walls, advertisements, etc., are all beautifully shot, with great artistic craftsmanship and charm. This forms an overall living background and flavor, which not only matches the aesthetic mindset of teenagers but also reflects a certain cultural taste.

    有追求有开拓
    ——由电影《豆蔻年华》说起
    王云缦
    青少年题材的电影，要拍得活泼清新，让人爱看，而又要让一代新人接触、了解、品尝一点人生的滋味。这正是由《多梦时节》、《普莱维梯彻公司》至新近问世的《豆蔻年华》等青少年题材影片的艺术追求，并取得了可喜的成就。
    相比而言，《豆蔻年华》的文学本更具有校园剧的模式。它主要表现的是一所寄宿中学的生活，场景也相对集中于一间高中女生宿舍里，这很容易使人联想起相近似的《女大学生宿舍》，区别似乎仅在大学和中学而已。应该说，正是导演的艺术再创造，较好地发掘了剧作的思想内涵，以流畅、新颖、灵活的电影手段，再现了一段多采多姿、耐人寻味的中学生生活。可见，同等水准的文学本，经过导演的精心探索和辛勤努力，是可能更上一层楼的。
    电影艺术的主体是人。青、少年银幕形象的贫乏和薄弱，至今是创作上的一大难题。我们始终没有像《小兵张嘎》这样鲜明生动的当代少年形象。《豆蔻年华》表现的是一伙中学生的群像，以个别形象论，自还有各自的缺憾。但，这些女学生的群像，特别是城市姑娘曹咪咪和农村女孩姚小禾，相互映照，各添其彩。例如她们个性不同，喜好有别，却具有分外亲密的友谊。只是当曹咪咪意外受伤、住院之际，姚小禾却一心扑在功课上，忽略了对知心同学殷切期待着的关注。这便从一个侧面启示少年一代，即使在激烈的生存竞争中，也不要忘了爱别人，关心别人。青、少年是生命力最旺盛的时期，同学之间的联系和交流也特别频繁，影片选取这样的情节来刻画两名女学生形象，确有“一箭双雕”的艺术效果。成人形象在这部影片中着墨不多，有的却颇具魅力。如那个始终背向镜头、终生默默劳作的大李老师；如那个手不离大把宿舍钥匙的老年女管理员等等，导演正是强化了这些细节和造型效果，使之为少年们提供了一个可敬可爱的成人世界。
    当今的一代新人，对电影的观赏口味、爱好、需求，已发生了种种新的变化。《多梦时节》有意在生活真实的基点上，引伸出诗意的人生哲理，其用意是可取的。只是，尚有一种外加的、人为化的痕迹。《普莱维梯彻公司》和
  《豆蔻年华》便又跨进了一步，使观众从不同形象和生活场景中自如地体会到人生的多种涵义。
    在结构上，影片也摆脱了惯用的单一情节故事的叙事模式，而采取了多线索的、交织式的形式。这便显得比较开放，自由，活泼。自然，重点、中心仍在这一群女学生身上，她们的线索、脉络是清晰的，一贯的，而由此生发开去，从盖平、夏雨以及由海外归来的老校友尹琼的形象，将生活面扩展至社会、文革和海外。这种多线索、交织式的开放结构，使观众的视野不仅看到了一间宿舍，一所中学，而是一个社会、一个世界的侧影。值得一提的是，影片除了采取明晰、具体的情节线索外，有的还采取暗示、虚写的表现方式，如有人在国际中学生数学大赛前，冒名给姚小禾发来母亲病危的电报，便始终没有交代这是谁的行为，留给人们自由猜想的悬念感。这种虚虚实实，亦明亦暗的情节结构方式，是引人入胜和富有新颖感的。
    《豆蔻年华》的生活色彩也显得较为丰富多样。如女同学们在宿舍里模拟“时装表演”的场景，拍摄角度灵活，形象造型活泼，且反映了一群天真可爱的女孩子对现代生活和美的向往，虽显得浪漫色彩过重了点。又如盖平这一人物的引入和出现，使生活的严峻和校园的闲适构成了对比和反差，也使影片在色调上改变了过于纯化的通病。此外，全片具有优美向上的艺术格调，树丛，石路，大墙，广告等等都拍得很美，颇具艺术匠心和魅力。这从整体上构成了一种生活背景和韵味，既符合青少年审美的心态，又反映了一定的文化格调。
