Thai Prime Minister Chan yesterday evening met with Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) Vice Chairman Chea Sim in Bangkok. The two sides held a two-hour discussion on the Cambodian issue. After the meeting, Chea Sim issued a written statement to the press.

In his statement, Chea Sim said that the one-month Paris International Conference on the comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian issue focused on two main points: first, Vietnam should withdraw all its troops from Cambodia under the effective supervision of a United Nations international monitoring body; second, a temporary four-party government led by Prince Sihanouk should be established to achieve national reconciliation. Under the supervision of the United Nations, this government would be responsible for organizing free, fair, and democratic national elections. The majority of countries participating in the Paris Conference supported these two points, but they were completely rejected by Vietnam and its puppets.

Regarding the stance of the Cambodian National Resistance Forces and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, Chea Sim pointed out that the Cambodian National Resistance Forces and the Coalition Government, led by Prince Sihanouk, continue to insist on a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue based on Prince Sihanouk's five-point proposal.

Before meeting with Chea Sim, Chan also met separately with Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the leader of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, Son Sann.

A spokesperson for the Thai Prime Minister's Office told reporters that Chan's separate, informal meetings with the various Cambodian factions aimed to understand the reasons for the failure of the Paris Conference and the current positions of the different factions.

According to Agence France-Presse, the Phnom Penh government, backed by Vietnam, plans to launch a major offensive against the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces in November.

The report quoted a Phnom Penh military officer as saying that the Phnom Penh forces will take large-scale actions aimed at eliminating the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces along the 56th Highway in Battambang Province.

**Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 14th.**

According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea radio station today, Vietnam sent an additional 7,000 troops to Cambodia in early September.

The radio station reported that on September 2, Vietnam transported 6,000 soldiers by ship from the southern province of Kien Giang to the city of Kampong Cham in Cambodia. Some of these soldiers were already wearing Phnom Penh regime military uniforms and were quickly dispatched to other regions.

On September 4, another 940 Vietnamese soldiers arrived in Kampong Cham's Chuk district by truck via the 3rd Highway from Kien Giang. On September 6, more than 600 Vietnamese soldiers arrived in Kampong Cham by ship from Kien Giang.

　　差猜与乔森潘讨论柬问题
　　金边军队计划进攻民柬部队
　　越又向柬埔寨增兵七千余人
    本报曼谷9月13日电　记者刘爱成报道：泰国总理差猜昨晚在这里会见了民柬副主席乔森潘。双方就柬问题进行了两小时会谈。会谈结束后，乔森潘副主席向记者散发了一份书面材料。
    乔森潘在这份书面材料中说，历时一个月的巴黎国际会议在讨论全面政治解决柬问题过程中有两大焦点：一是越南应在联合国一国际监督机构有效监督下从柬撤出所有各种军队；二是通过建立由西哈努克亲王领导的临时四方政府，实现民族和解。同时在联合国监督下由临时四方政府负责组织全国自由、公正和民主选举。参加巴黎会议的绝大多数国家都对上述两点表示支持，但遭到越南及其傀儡的完全拒绝。
    在谈及柬民族抵抗力量和民柬联合政府的立场时，乔森潘指出，以西哈努克亲王为领导的柬民族抵抗力量和民柬联合政府仍然坚持在西哈努克亲王5点建议的基础上全面政治解决柬问题。
    在会见乔森潘副主席之前，差猜总理还分别会见了拉那烈王子和高棉人民民族解放阵线领导人宋双。
    泰国总理府发言人昨天对记者说，差猜总理分别与柬各派单独举行非正式会晤的目的是要了解巴黎会议失败的原因以及各派目前所持的立场等有关情况。
    新华社北京9月14日电 据法新社报道，越南扶植的柬埔寨金边政府军计划在11月向民柬国民军发动一场重大攻势。
    报道援引金边军队军官的话说，金边军队将采取大规模行动，旨在肃清菩萨省境内56号公路沿线的民柬国民军。
    新华社北京9月14日电 据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，越南9月初又向柬埔寨增派军队7000人。
    这家电台广播说，9月2日越南从南部河仙省用轮船运送6000名士兵到柬埔寨贡布省的白马市登陆。这批士兵中有一部分人已穿着金边伪军军装。他们很快被派往其他地区。
    9月4日，又有940名越军乘汽车从河仙沿3号公路抵达贡布省祖克县。9月6日，又有600余越南士兵从河仙乘船到达云壤港。
