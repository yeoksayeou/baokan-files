The Chinese Mountaineering Association spokesman confirmed to reporters today that the mountaineering organizations of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement to jointly form a team to climb Mount Everest from the Chinese side between March and May of next year.

According to the initial agreement, the three parties will form a team of about 50 people, including 15 athletes (5 from each side). The joint mountaineering team will establish a base camp at the foot of Mount Everest next March, and the summit assault is planned to take place between late April and early May.

This summit attempt will use the "traditional route" along the northeast ridge, the same route successfully used by the Chinese mountaineering team in 1960 and 1975. The five Chinese team members participating in next year's climb will all come from the Tibet Autonomous Region.
