The People's Daily, Beijing, September 11th - Reporter Luo Pan reports: In September of this year, the China Social Welfare Prize-Drawing Fundraising Committee celebrated its second anniversary and held a new leadership election in accordance with its charter. Recently, the committee's chairman and Minister of Civil Affairs, Cui Naifu, answered questions posed by a reporter from this newspaper.

Q: What are the current channels for raising social welfare funds?

A: In the past, China mainly relied on state and collective channels to raise social welfare funds, which placed a heavy burden on both the state and collectives, making it difficult to address many social welfare issues. To open up new channels for raising social welfare funds, the Ministry of Civil Affairs submitted a formal report to the State Council in August 1986, proposing the use of prize-drawing tickets to raise funds from individuals and society to develop social welfare. After discussion and approval by the State Council, the Ministry of Civil Affairs organized the China Social Welfare Prize-Drawing Fundraising Committee, which exclusively conducts prize-drawing fundraising activities nationwide.

Q: There are rumors that some people have embezzled funds raised by the committee. Could you please comment on the use of the social welfare funds raised in the past two years?

A: This is a rumor spread by a few individuals with ulterior motives during the turmoil. There has never been any case of individuals embezzling or misappropriating the raised funds. By the end of June this year, the committee had sold 600 million yuan worth of prize-drawing tickets nationwide. According to the sales amount, 40% is allocated as welfare funds, totaling 240 million yuan. Of this, 80% is retained for local use, amounting to 192 million yuan; 20% is remitted to the committee, totaling 48 million yuan. The welfare funds directly managed by the committee are mainly used for the following five areas: supporting the establishment of 42 key social welfare projects nationwide, providing 500 million yuan in interest subsidies and loans to 153 welfare factories, allocating 500 million yuan for the rehabilitation of the disabled and special education this year, donating 100 million yuan each to the Yunnan earthquake-stricken areas and the Chinese Red Cross Society, and supporting the training of personnel and technological assistance for mental health and poverty alleviation, totaling 60 million yuan. The welfare funds raised locally have already been put to use, establishing more than 1,000 welfare projects. It can be said that the use of social welfare funds is highly transparent, with clear accounts and full disclosure.

Q: What is the relationship between the committee and the China Disabled Persons' Federation?

A: These are two different organizations with different natures and tasks, and there is no subordinate relationship between them. The committee has some business connections with the China Disabled Persons' Federation. It should be noted that neither the China Disabled Persons' Federation nor the China Disabled Persons' Federation has issued prize-drawing tickets.

　　民政部部长崔乃夫就有奖募捐答记者问
　　募集福利资金全用于福利事业
    本报北京9月11日讯　记者罗盘报道：今年9月，中国社会福利有奖募捐委员会成立两周年并按章程换届。日前，该委员会主任、民政部部长崔乃夫回答了本报记者提出的问题。
    问：到目前为止，筹集社会福利资金有哪些渠道？
    答：我国过去筹集社会福利资金，主要靠国家和集体两条渠道，致使国家和集体负担过重，许多应解决的社会福利问题无法解决。为开辟筹集社会福利资金的新渠道，民政部于1986年8月向国务院正式呈交请示报告，建议采用发行奖券的办法，向个人和社会筹集资金，发展社会福利事业。经国务院常务会讨论批准，由民政部筹组了中国社会福利有奖募捐委员会，并由该委员会独家在全国统一开展有奖募捐活动。
    问：传说有人侵吞中募委募集的资金，请问两年来筹集的社会福利资金使用情况如何？
    答：这是在动乱中一小部分别有用心的人制造的一个谣言，根本不存在任何个人侵吞或者挪动募集资金的事情。到今年6月底，中募委在全国共销售6亿元奖券，按销售额的40％作为福利资金，共筹集2.4亿元，其中80％留地方使用，为1.9亿元；20％上交中募委，为4800万元。中募委直接掌握的福利资金主要用于以下5个方面：先后在全国资助兴办了42个重点社会福利事业项目，给153个福利厂补贴500万元利息提供了贷款，今年支持残疾人康复和特殊教育经费500万元，向云南地震灾区和中国红十字会各捐赠100万元，资助精神卫生专修班培训人才和科技扶贫共60万元。地方筹集的社会福利资金，已发挥作用，兴办各类福利项目1000余个。可以说，社会福利资金的使用透明度很高，都是有帐可查、完全公开的。
    问：中募委与中国残联是什么关系？
    答：这是两个性质不同和任务不同的机构，相互之间并无隶属关系。中募委在业务上与中国残联有一定联系。应该说明的是，不论全国残疾人基金会，还是中国残联，都没有发行过奖券。
