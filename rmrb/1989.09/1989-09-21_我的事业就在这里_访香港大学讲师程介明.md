“My Career Lies Here”
– Interview with Hong Kong University Lecturer Cheng Jieming

Reported by Huang Xingqun

Like a giant magnet, it has held him tightly. Cheng Jieming’s 40 years in Hong Kong have almost all been spent in schools. On one September day, the reporter spent half a day with him, and their conversation never strayed from education.

“I came to Hong Kong with my parents when I was five,” Cheng Jieming said. “From primary school to high school, I attended nine different schools. Among them, there were mission schools, English colleges, and Chinese schools. Now, no matter which type of school in Hong Kong I talk about, I am familiar with it.”

After graduating from the University of Hong Kong, Cheng Jieming was hired back to his alma mater, Baoqiao Middle School, as a teacher. Later, a group of retired teachers planned to open a new school and invited him to be the principal. He served in this role for nine years. All his efforts were poured into the school. This experience is unforgettable for him.

It is said that Cheng Jieming later, with the support of his wife, spent all his savings to study in the UK. He finally obtained a Ph.D. in Educational Planning and Policy Analysis in 1978. Now, he teaches educational administration courses at the University of Hong Kong. Often, many officials from Hong Kong’s public and private schools come to him, asking him to “diagnose” their schools and provide suggestions for improving school management.

When the conversation returned from reminiscing about the past to the present, Cheng Jieming had more to say. He said, “Now, every day there are endless tasks. Besides daily teaching duties, I have several research projects on my hands.” He counted on his fingers: “First, I have been commissioned by UNESCO to prepare a summary report for an international conference. The theme is the changes in educational planning and reform in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years; second, I have been invited by the International Institute for Educational Planning to participate in a survey of basic education in developing countries. It is planned that in the next two years, I will conduct a special investigation in Zhejiang; third, I have been commissioned by the World Bank to participate in a feasibility study report on providing educational funding assistance to impoverished provinces in mainland China…” In addition, Cheng Jieming is currently leading the drafting of the first “Professional Code of Ethics for Educators” in Hong Kong and has been elected as the chairman of the management advisory committee of the Hong Kong “Teachers’ Center.”

“Are you determined to stay in Hong Kong and continue your work here?”

“Yes. The reason is simple: Hong Kong’s future cannot do without education. I have personally witnessed Hong Kong’s education develop step by step. Engaging in education in Hong Kong is my wish. Moreover, I feel that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures, that is, playing the role of a ‘cultural translator.’ I am very willing to contribute to the exchange of education between China and the world.”

Cheng Jieming finally said, “Recently, many friends have kindly asked me: Why don’t you emigrate? I often counter: Why should I emigrate? For me, there is no choice between emigrating or not. My career is here.”

    “我的事业就在这里”
    ——访香港大学讲师程介明
    本报记者　黄幸群
    宛如一个巨大的磁场，把他紧紧吸住。程介明在香港生活的40年，几乎全是在学校度过的。9月的一天，记者与他相叙半天，话没离开过教育。
    “我5岁随父母到了香港，”程介明说，“从小学到中学，先后就读过9所学校。其中，有教会办的，也有英文书院、中文学校。现在，不论谈起香港哪一种类型的学校，我都不陌生。”
    程介明从香港大学毕业后，应聘回母校培侨中学当了教员。后来，有一批年老退休的教员酝酿开办一所新的学校，让他当校长。这一当就是9年。他全部的心血都浇在校园里了。这段经历使他终生难忘。
    听说，程介明后来在妻子的支持下，倾尽所有积蓄，远赴英伦求学。终于在1978年获得了教育规划和政策分析的博士学位。如今，他在港大讲授教育行政管理课程，经常有不少香港官立、私立学校的人士上门找他，请他为学校“诊病”，提供改善学校管理的建议。
    当话题从往昔的追忆中回到现实时，程介明话更多了。他说：“现在每天都有做不完的事，除了日常教务，压在手上的研究课题就有好几个。”他扳着手指数：“第一，应联合国教科文组织之约，为一个国际研讨会准备一份总结报告，主题是近年亚太地区教育规划和改革的变化；第二，接受国际教育规划研究所的邀请，参与对发展中国家基础教育调查，预定在今、明两年中，奔赴浙江作专题调查；第三，受世界银行的委托，参与对内地困难省份提供教育经费援助的可行性研究报告……”此外程介明正在主持香港有史以来第一份“教育工作者专业守则”的草拟工作，还被选为香港“教师中心”的管理咨询委员会主席。
    “你是决心留在香港继续耕耘下去了？”
    “是的。理由很简单，香港的未来不能没有教育。我是亲眼看着香港的教育一步步走过来的，在香港从事教育是我的心愿。而且，我感到香港在中外文化交流中有一种独有优势，那就是充当‘文化翻译’的角色。我很乐意为中国与世界的教育交流尽一份绵力。”
    程介明最后说：“近来，不少朋友善意地问我：你为什么不移民？我常反问：为什么要移民？对我来说，根本不存在移民与否的抉择。我的事业就在这里。”
