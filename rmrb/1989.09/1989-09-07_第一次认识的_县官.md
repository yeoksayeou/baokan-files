Title: My First Encounter with a County Magistrate

The first time I "met" a county magistrate, it was not through any personal connection, but rather, I knew him, while he did not know me.

In the year of liberation, I was only ten years old. I heard that a "county magistrate" had arrived, and that he was a "carpenter." Those who had some education said, "The Communists sure do things differently, letting a carpenter be the county magistrate."

One day, the county magistrate came to the village to give a speech to the people. I also went to see the "carpenter." What a speech it was! He stood on a large stone roller, with about ten old men and women chatting below, seemingly not paying attention. I looked at him; he wore a loose, gray military uniform and a tilted military cap, looking far from imposing.

What he said, I think only I was listening. The others were there to see the county magistrate or the "carpenter," and no one seemed interested in his propaganda.

He spoke about how the liberation army had just arrived in western Henan and needed grain; he was there to borrow grain from the people, promising to return it. At that time, the government was not stable, and local organizations had not been established. He spoke for a long time, but no one responded to his words. He approached a middle-aged man, hoping to ask him to help with the grain borrowing, but the man refused and walked away without even looking back.

He did not borrow a single grain. As the sun set, he had to call his communication officer—whom we called the "bodyguard," a child dressed in adult military uniform—to return. I did not think much of his "bodyguard," because while the "carpenter" was speaking, sweating profusely, the "bodyguard" was just playing with the villagers' chickens. After all, he was just a child in adult clothes. I thought at the time, if bandits came, the "carpenter" would have to carry this "bodyguard" and run!

That night, I couldn't sleep, thinking about the "carpenter," who had not borrowed any grain, and wondering how he would eat tonight.

After Luoyang was liberated, the situation stabilized, and the local government at the district and village levels was gradually established. That spring festival, I was overjoyed and ran around playing everywhere.

At the former county government building, I saw a few old women talking to the security personnel: "We have never been inside the county government building in our lives; we want to go in and have a look." The security personnel did not know what to do, but then the county magistrate came out. Upon hearing the situation, he immediately led these curious people inside to have a look. I followed them in.

The county magistrate explained as he walked: "This is the judicial department, where lawsuits were handled in the old society. The rich could bribe their way out, while the poor, even if they had a case, could not afford to come in... This is the financial department, where taxes and grain levies were collected in the old society. The money came from the people... This is the county magistrate's hall, where I am now sitting. You see, do I look the part..."

After the tour, I returned home, thinking about today's luck, whether it was because of the county magistrate's blessing or the old women's fortune.

School started again. At that time, schools not only had teaching tasks but also had to organize social activities. At that time, there were Sunday current affairs lectures, where cadres and teachers took turns propagating to the people. Once, it was the county magistrate's turn to speak. After seven o'clock, the principal, fearing he might forget, sent us two students to remind him. On the way, we met him walking, so he held our hands and came to the venue.

This time, he spoke about the "Zhongzhou currency," which was the circulating paper currency issued by our Communist government. I still remember some of his words: "The Zhongzhou currency travels far, east to the Huai River, west to Hanzhong, south to the Yangtze River, and north to Huabei... The Zhongzhou currency is stable in value, with 200 units equivalent to one silver dollar..." This speech was very successful, and the audience clapped a lot. After the speech, the county magistrate left, walking alone, with no one offering him tea, no one inviting him to dinner, and not even anyone to see him off. Our principal was busy cleaning up the tables in the venue.

Speaking without a script was a feature of that time. When a meeting was held, a table was pulled out, and he would speak extemporaneously. I remember once at an anti-bandit meeting, as soon as the people gathered, he went on stage and said, "Today, we are here to execute six people!" It was straightforward and to the point. "Why do we need to execute them? Because they have committed capital offenses!" Then he listed the crimes of the criminals and decided to severely punish them.

After middle school, the first county magistrate I knew was transferred, and his position became higher, serving as a prefect. He brought his bound-foot wife from his hometown. She was truly his "old" companion, older than him.

That old woman brought her spinning tools from the countryside—a spinning wheel that was about to fall apart. From then on, whenever he attended a meeting, she would spin thread. After work, the two would walk down the street, one in front of the other, attracting people to point and comment behind their backs: "That is the prefect and his 'old love'..."

Someone hinted to him, "The 'old love' is too old, and she has bound feet..." He told others with a smile: "Who says she has small feet? During the guerrilla warfare, I was injured, and she carried me for several miles. At that time, if she were not a few years older than me, I would not have been able to carry her!"

He did not despise her for being old and continued to walk with his bound-foot "old love," but they were not as intimate as modern young couples, holding hands or embracing. They just walked one in front of the other, always maintaining a distance of four or five steps.

After 1957, I heard that he had made "mistakes." I had already left home to attend university, so I did not know the details. But I believe one thing: he always thought of others, not himself.

After the Cultural Revolution ended and the rectification of wrongs began, his problems were all rectified. Now he has passed away. I heard the news and felt sad, missing not only him but also the first county magistrate I knew.

### 第一次认识的“县官”

    第一次认识的“县官”
    郑慧生
    说“认识”，并非有什么私交，而是我认识他，他不认得我。
    解放那年，我才十岁。听说来了个“县官”，是个“木匠”。肚里有点墨水的人都说：“共产党做事真够鲜了，让个木匠来当县长。”
    一天，县长来到乡里，给群众讲话。我也跑去了，想看看“木匠”。那是一次什么样的讲话呀！他站在一只石磙上，下面十几个老头老婆在聊着天听。我看他，一身松松垮垮的灰布军装，加上一顶塌拉着帽沿的八角帽，一点也不威武。
    他讲的什么，恐怕只有我一个人在听。其他的人，都是来看县长或看“木匠”的，没有人要听他宣传什么。
    他讲了，解放大军刚来到豫西，需要公粮；他，是来向群众借粮的，保证有借有还……那时候，政权不稳固，地方组织没有建立，他讲了半天，连接他话茬的人都没有。他走向一个中年汉子，想请他张罗张罗借粮的事，那人一口推托而去，连头也不回。
    他连一粒粮也没有借到。日落西山了，只好招呼自己的通讯员——我们叫做
  “护兵”的，是个穿大人军装的孩子——回去。我真看不上他的“护兵”，因为
  “木匠”讲话急得满头大汗，而他，只在旁边逗群众的鸡玩。本来嘛，还是个穿大人军装的孩子。我当时想，要是遇上土匪，“木匠”还得背着这个“护兵”跑呢！
    夜里，我睡不着，想着这个“木匠”，没有借到粮食，今晚咋吃饭呢？
    洛阳解放后，局面稳定了，区乡基层政权也陆续建立。这年春节，我傻开心，到处跑着去玩。
    在原来的县政府门口，见几个老太太和警卫人员说：“一辈子没进过县衙门，想进去看看。”警卫人员不好作主，这时县长出来，一听情况，立即乐呵呵地引导这些好奇的百姓进去参观。我于是也跟了进去。
    县长一面走一面讲解：“这里是司法科，旧社会打官司的地方，富人有钱能使鬼推磨，穷人有理没钱别进来……这里是财粮科，过去苛捐杂税逼粮逼款都在这里，羊毛出在羊身上，钱可是得叫咱大家拿……这里是县老爷坐的大堂，现在我在坐着，你们看，配不配……”
    参观完毕，我回到家里，想着今天的运气，不知是沾了县长的光，还是托了老太太们的福。
    小学开学了。那时的学校除了担负教学任务，还要搞社会活动。当时举办了星期日时事讲座，由干部、教师轮流向群众作宣传。有一次，轮到县长讲话。七点过后，校长怕他忘了，派我们两个小学生前去催请。半路上碰到他徒步走来，他就拉着我们的手来到会场上。
    这一次，他讲的是“中州币”，那是我们共产党政权发行的流通纸币。我至今还记得他的几句话：“中州币，行得远，东到淮河，西到汉中，南至长江，北连华北……中州币，价值稳定，每二百元折合银元一块……”这次的讲话很成功，人们拍了不少巴掌。讲完后，县长走了，徒步而去，没有人给他倒茶，没有人留他吃饭，甚至连送他的人也没有。我们的校长，在忙着收拾会场桌子呢。
    讲话不用稿，是当时的特色。开大会了，拉张桌子就讲，出口成章。记得一次镇反大会上，人一到齐，他登台就是一句话：“今天我们在这里，要杀六个人！”真是开门见山，一针见血。“……为什么要杀他们呢？因为他们犯了死罪！”然后历数罪犯恶迹，决定严惩。
      中学以后，我所认识的第一个人民县长调走了，官做大了，当了专员。他从家乡把自己的小脚老伴接来。那可真是他的“老”伴，比他还老。
    那老婆子从乡下带来自己的纺纱工具——一架眼看就要散架的纺花车。从此，他开会，她纺线。下班以后，两人一前一后上街轧马路，引动得路人在背后指指点点：那就是专员和他的“老爱”……
    有人转弯抹角提醒他，“老爱”已经太老，又是小脚……他笑着告诉别人：
  “谁说她脚小，打游击那年，我负了伤，她背着我跑了几里地，那阵子，要不是她比我大三四岁，真背不动我呢！”
    他终于没有嫌她老，继续陪着他的小脚“老爱”轧马路，但也不像现代青年挽手搂腰似的亲密，只不过是一前一后，始终保持着四五步距离。
    1957年以后，听说他犯了“错误”，我已经离家上大学去了，诸事不得其详。但我相信一条，他都是在替别人着想，不是为了自己。
    文革结束，拨乱反正，他的问题都得到了洗雪。现在他去世了，我闻讯怅然，想念的不仅仅是他，而是我所认识的第一个人民县长。
