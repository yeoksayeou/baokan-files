	The practice of arbitrary levies in Jingmen City persists despite prohibitions. At the end of May, the city's audit department investigated the situation of 184 state-owned enterprises being arbitrarily levied from January 1988 to May of this year. It was found that 154 enterprises, accounting for 83.7%, had been subject to arbitrary levies, amounting to over 1.07 million yuan.

	In April 1988, the State Council issued the Provisional Regulations on Prohibiting Arbitrary Levies on Enterprises, which clearly stipulates that no additional fees can be levied on enterprises beyond what is prescribed by laws and regulations. However, the situation in our city shows that this regulation has not been seriously implemented. There are two main reasons for this. First, the supervisory departments have been lax in their supervision and enforcement. The Provisional Regulations on Prohibiting Arbitrary Levies on Enterprises only stipulate that the financial department should examine the legality and reasonableness of the payment of fees, and that the planning, financial, pricing, taxation, and banking departments should strengthen supervision and inspection. However, it does not stipulate the legal responsibilities of these supervisory departments. In the absence of reports, complaints, or exposures from the enterprises, these departments have simply turned a blind eye. Second, some leaders have an insufficient understanding of the harmfulness of arbitrary levies on enterprises. Some leading organs even lead the way in arbitrary levies. The Standing Committee of the Jingmen Municipal People's Congress alone levied 120,000 yuan from enterprises last year: the Municipal Chemical Factory was levied 50,000 yuan for legal education materials, the Light Industry Bureau and Light Industry Supply and Marketing Cooperative were levied 20,000 yuan for construction fees, and the First Chemical Fertilizer Factory was levied 50,000 yuan for management fees. The amount levied was the highest in the city.

    荆门市摊派风有禁不止
    5月底，我市审计部门调查了市属184个企业1988年1月至今年5月被摊派的情况，发现被摊派企业有154个，占83.7％；被摊派的金额达到107万多元。
    1988年4月，国务院发布的禁止向企业摊派暂行条例明确规定，不得在法律、法规的规定之外向企业征收有关费用。但从查明的情况看，这一条例在我市没有得到认真落实。其中有两条原因值得重视。第一、监督部门监督制止不力。因为禁止向企业摊派暂行条例只规定了财政部门审查支付费用的合法性、合理性，计划、财政、物价、税务、银行等部门应加强监督检查，但没有规定这些监督部门的法律责任。在企业没有报告、检举揭发的情况下，这些部门也就听之任之。第二、某些领导人对向企业乱摊派的危害性认识不足。有的领导机关甚至带头搞摊派。市人大常委会仅去年一年就向企业摊派12万元：市化工厂分摊5万元普法资料费，一轻局一轻供销公司分摊2万元建房费，市第一化肥厂分摊5万元管理费，摊派数额之大居全市首位。
