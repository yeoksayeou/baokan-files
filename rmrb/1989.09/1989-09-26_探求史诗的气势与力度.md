The epic film "The Founding Ceremony," produced by Changchun Film Studio to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, showcases the grandeur of an epic, reenacting the final struggle between two historical destinies on the eve of the birth of New China. It pulsates with the immense historical passion of the people creating a new century, fiery and stirring, moving the heart.

In terms of the overall artistic style of this film, it washes away the vulgar and frivolous small-mindedness prevalent in current film creation, presenting a grand and majestic demeanor, and displaying a precious historical character. As directors Li Qiankuan and Xiao Guiyun said, "To shoot such a revolutionary historical epic, one must seek new cinematic language and reach a new aesthetic height."

Whether in terms of the construction of visual imagery, the refinement of artistic characters, or the excavation of historical content, the creators of "The Founding Ceremony" have undoubtedly achieved pioneering achievements in the realm of epic films. As the old man Hegel said, "The spirit of an era and a nation is the substantial and active source of an epic," and at the same time, he emphasized that the poet (artist) as the subject should fuse this spirit of the times into artistic images and "completely retreat to the background" (see "Aesthetics" Volume 3). The success of "The Founding Ceremony" lies in the fact that the creators, facing a highly political subject matter, were able to transcend short-sighted political utilitarianism and elevate it to the realm of the epic. I believe that an important creative experience here is that the artist's subjectivity delved into the depths of history, drawing inspiration and creative passion from the tragic historical march of the three-year Liberation War and the people's revolutionary struggle, revealing the great spirit of the era when the Chinese nation stood up like a giant of the East.

This film takes the turbulent historical changes in the final year of the Liberation War as its grand backdrop, focusing on the depiction of the decisive battle between the revolutionary camp led by Mao Zedong and the counter-revolutionary camp led by Chiang Kai-shek. It intertwines military confrontations with intricate political struggles, fully demonstrating the creators' ability to compose artistic chapters with the wind and thunder of the times.

The grandeur and power of the epic are indeed inseparable from the artist's historical vision, aesthetic perspective, and grasp of certain grand and majestic historical scenes. However, more importantly, it lies in the portrayal of people—the artistic portrayal of the historical deeds and mental states of historical figures. The so-called historical masterstroke perhaps lies in the ability to transcend the trivial descriptions of historical events and the redundant expressions of personal desires, thereby tightly grasping the pulse of history and portraying historical figures who are both commanding and full of life. Mao Zedong, descending from the "altar," is restored to a living person, but without losing the revolutionary spirit and the demeanor of a political leader; while the image of Chiang Kai-shek, following the film "The Xi'an Incident," has made new breakthroughs, emphasizing his sense of historical loss. Mao Zedong's first appearance is at the New Year's Eve party in Xibaipo, where he holds his youngest daughter Li Na on his lap, smiling as he watches the young people joyfully dancing the "Conqueror's Whip." The roaring bonfire adds a warm hue to the scene, creating an atmosphere of festivity as the people's revolution approaches victory. In parallel, Chiang Kai-shek is performing a farce of retreat in the name of progress in his official residence in Nanjing, issuing a "New Year's Proclamation," hinting at the atmosphere of decay with the saying "When a leaf falls, one knows the autumn of the world." Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, as the core figures leading the entire play, do not engage in face-to-face confrontations or direct conflicts. The creators chose this parallel juxtaposition of montage treatment, aiming to embed the essence of the decisive battle between the two historical destinies and form a narrative capability. This parallel juxtaposition of montage, repeatedly presenting and accumulating, forms an artistic power of generalization. Among them, it is worth mentioning that there are many exquisite artistic brushstrokes. For example, on the eve of the founding ceremony, after the foundation-laying ceremony for the Monument to the People's Heroes, Mao Zedong's thoughts surged as he thought of Fang Zhimin, Yang Kaihui, and countless revolutionary martyrs who had sacrificed their lives. He thus admonished Shan Eng: "Throughout history, there is only one rule for the rise and fall of dynasties: those who gain the hearts of the people and follow the will of the people gain the world; those who lose the hearts of the people and go against the will of the people lose the world." At the same time, in the Yangmingshan Villa in Taipei, Chiang Kai-shek admonished Chiang Ching-kuo to "know shame and then be brave," and helplessly admitted, "Mao Zedong is sometimes more brilliant than I am. The Father of the Nation said, 'Great affairs of the world, those who follow it prosper, those who go against it perish.'" The historical reflections of the victors and losers on both sides appeared in such a wondrous coincidence, becoming the highlight of this film. The creators cleverly gave a "defamiliarization" treatment to the familiar historical materials, thus not only giving the audience a fresh feeling of rereading history but also gaining a philosophical generalization through artistic images, as Lessing said, "Poetry is more philosophical than history."

The remarkable artistic achievements of "The Founding Ceremony" are prominently reflected in the awakening of the "epic consciousness" and the historical grasp of artistic images. When Mao Zedong, from discussing the immense passion hidden within the masses, went on to assert that "the speed of economic construction in New China will be quite fast," Liu Shaoqi immediately revealed that Mao Zedong had previously made a conservative estimate that "we still have about 90% of our economic life stuck in the past," calmly reminding him, "Don't let there be incidents like one Mao Zedong opposing another Mao Zedong, ah." Mao Zedong patted his forehead and fell into deep thought. Such artistic descriptions, lightly pointing out the ideological collisions between proletarian leaders, show a certain historical penetration and profound meaning, which is quite precious.

On the eve of the founding ceremony, the film also wrote a scene of Mao Zedong meeting with his fellow villagers from Shaoshan. Here, the creators used an ironic pen, both benevolently mocking the deep-seated imperial thoughts on Chinese peasants and adding a certain historical charm to Mao Zedong's image.

In the construction of visual imagery, the creators deliberately pursued the fusion of historical documentary style and revolutionary epic grandeur. For scenes involving the Political Consultative Conference and the founding ceremony, they borrowed several precious historical footage from documentaries to enhance the historical solemnity and the irreplicable atmosphere of the times. In some lyrical segments, they adopted a large freehand expressive style, such as the foundation-laying ceremony for the Monument to the People's Heroes, using "elevated" photography for poetic embellishment; again, such as the stone steps of Tiananmen Gate, Mao Zedong and the founding heroes, the representatives of the ceremony, stepping up with steady and confident steps, interspersed with solemn pillars, soaring pigeons, dazzling sunlight, and other expressive "empty shots," powerfully highlighting the sublime poetic sentiment of this "ascending the stairs" historical scene, thus pushing the entire play to the climax of the epic.

In "The Founding Ceremony," more than 130 historical figures appeared, setting a scale rarely seen in Chinese film history; among them, the leading actors Gu Yue and Sun Feihu, with their performances that capture both the spirit and the form, made outstanding artistic contributions to this epic film.

What is particularly valuable is that the creators of the film are engaged in artistic cultivation with a conscious sense of historical mission. They elevate the artist's "small self" to the "great self" of history, placing artistic individuality at the intersection of history and reality for refinement and recasting, thereby reaching a modern aesthetic height.

"The Founding Ceremony," along with historical epics such as "Perpetual Kunlun" and "Bose Uprising," have presented us with new topics and experiences for theoretical discussions on the creation of revolutionary historical genres. I believe this is a rare historical opportunity. Seriously analyzing the achievements and shortcomings of these works will undoubtedly play a certain role in promoting the creation of future epic films.

    探求史诗的气势与力度
    黄式宪
    长影献给国庆四十周年的历史巨片《开国大典》，以史诗式的辉煌，再现了新中国诞生前夜两种历史命运的最后决战，吞吐着一种人民创造新世纪的巨大历史激情，烈烈如炽，撼人心魄。
    就这部影片的总体艺术风貌而言，它一洗当前电影创作中媚俗、浮靡的小家子气，呈现出宏阔的大家气派，显示出一种可贵的历史品格。正如导演李前宽、肖桂云所说，“拍摄这样一部革命历史题材的巨片，必须寻找新的电影语言，达到一个新的美学高度。”
    无论从造型意象的构筑、艺术形象的锤炼或历史内涵的开掘来看，《开国大典》的编导在史诗性巨片领域中无疑取得了开拓性的成就。诚如黑格尔老人所说，“一个时代和一个民族的精神是史诗的有实体性的起作用的根源”，同时，他又十分注重诗人（艺术家）作为主体将这种时代精神熔铸于艺术形象而“完全退到后台”（见《美学》第三卷）。《开国大典》的成功正在于，创作者面对的是一个政治性极强的题材，但却能超脱于目光短浅的政治功利主义而向史诗领域提升，我以为，这里的一个重要创作经验就是，艺术家主体潜入了历史的深层，从三年解放战争以及人民革命斗争的悲壮历史行进中提取灵感和创作的激情，揭示了中华民族如东方巨人般站立起来的伟大时代精神。
    这部影片以解放战争最后一年间的历史风云变幻作为大背景，集中描绘了以毛泽东为首的人民革命营垒同以蒋介石为首的反革命营垒两种历史力量的大决战，将军事较量与波诡云谲的政治斗争错综交织，充分显示了创作者挟时代风雷而谱艺术华章的历史概括力。
    巨片的风骨和力度，诚然同艺术家的历史胸襟、审美视野以及对某些宏阔而气壮山河的历史场景的把握分不开，但更重要的还在于对人的刻画——对历史风云人物的历史作为及其心态的艺术刻画。所谓历史的大手笔，或许正体现于能超脱琐碎的历史事件的过程描述、超脱琐碎的个人欲望的冗赘表现，从而紧扣着历史的脉搏，写出既叱咤风云又血肉丰盈的历史人物来。毛泽东，从“神坛”走下来，被还原为一个活生生的人，但又不失革命的雄风和政治领袖的气度；而蒋介石的形象，继影片《西安事变》之后又有了新的突破，着力写了他的历史失落感。毛泽东第一次出场，是在西柏坡新年晚会上，他将小女儿李纳抱在膝上，笑吟吟观看着年轻人欢快地舞着“霸王鞭”，熊熊的篝火给画面增添了一种暖色调，烘托出一种人民革命正在迫近胜利的喜庆氛围；与之平行展开的是，蒋介石正在南京官邸以发布“新年文告”演出着一幕以退为进的丑剧，暗示出“一叶落而知天下秋”的衰颓氛围。毛泽东与蒋介石作为统领全剧的核心人物，他们之间并不发生面对面的交锋和直接冲突，创作者选择了这种平行并置的蒙太奇处理，旨在将两种历史命运大决战的内涵潜含其间并形成一种叙事的能力。这种平行并置的蒙太奇方式，复沓呈现、不断累积而形成一种艺术的概括力。其中值得提到的，还有不少精采的艺术笔墨。如开国大典前夕，为人民英雄纪念碑举行奠基礼之后，毛泽东思潮起伏，想到方志敏、杨开慧以及无数为革命英勇捐躯的先烈们，这样告诫岸英：“千古兴亡也只有一条规律，得民心、顺民意者得天下；失民心、逆民意者失天下”。与此同时，在台北的阳明山庄，蒋介石则告诫蒋经国要“知耻而后勇”，并无可奈地承认，“毛泽东有时比我高明。国父说过，天下大事，顺之者昌，逆之者亡。”两岸之间胜利者与失败者作为“训子”的历史沉思出现了如此奇妙的重合，成为这部影片画龙点睛之笔。创作者对人们所熟悉的历史素材，非常聪明地给予了“陌生化”的处理，从而既赋予观众某种重读历史的新鲜感，又透过艺术形象而获得某种哲学的概括，诚如莱辛所说，“诗歌比历史更富于哲学意味”。
    《开国大典》令人瞩目的艺术成就，突出地表现在“巨片意识”的觉醒以及在对艺术形象所作的历史主义把握上。当毛泽东从议论群众中蕴藏着极大的热情，进而断言“新中国经济建设的速度将会是相当快的”时，刘少奇当即揭示毛泽东过去曾作出“我们还有百分之九十左右的经济生活停留在古代”的保守估计，冷静地提醒说，“可不要发生此一毛泽东反对彼一毛泽东这类的事情啊”，毛泽东拍拍额头而陷于沉思，这样的艺术描写，淡淡地点出了无产阶级领袖人物之间的思想碰撞，显示着某种历史的穿透力而意蕴深邃，是相当难能可贵的。
    在举行开国大典前夕，影片还写了一场毛泽东会见韶山冲乡亲们的戏。这里，创作者以反讽笔法，既对中国农民身上积淀甚深的封建帝王思想予以善意的调侃，同时又为毛泽东的形象增添了某种历史的风趣。
    在造型意象的构筑上，编导刻意追求历史文献性与革命史诗气势的融合，涉及政治协商会议以及开国庆典的一些群众性和大阅兵场面，则从纪录片中借来若干珍贵的历史资料镜头，以增强画面的历史凝重感和不可重复的时代气息。在一些抒情的段落，则又采取大写意的表现性手法，如人民英雄纪念碑奠基礼，以“升格”摄影作诗意的渲染；再如登天安门城楼的石级，毛泽东以及开国元勋、观礼代表们，踏着从容、稳健的步伐，拾级而上，其间不断穿插以庄严的华表、奋飞的鸽群、眩目的阳光等写意性“空镜头”，有力地突出了这一个“拾级登楼”的历史性场面的崇高诗情，从而将全剧推向史诗的高潮。
    在《开国大典》里先后登场的历史人物多达一百三十多位，开中国电影史上所罕见的巨大规模；其中领衔主演的古月、孙飞虎，更以其神形兼得的表演艺术创造，为这部史诗式巨片作出了突出的艺术贡献。
    特别值得珍视的是，影片编导是以自觉的历史使命感投入艺术耕耘的，他们把艺术家的“小我”升华为历史的“大我”，将艺术个性置于历史与现实的交汇点上予以锤炼、重铸，从而达到一种现代审美的高度。
    《开国大典》以及《巍巍昆仑》、《百色起义》等历史巨片的联袂而至，为我们在理论上探讨革命史传样式的创作提出了新的课题、新的经验，我以为，这或许是一次可遇而难期的历史性机遇，认真剖析这些作品的成就与不足，相信必将对今后的史诗性巨片创作起到一定的推进作用的。
