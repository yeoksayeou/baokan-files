Promoting Chinese Traditional Culture: A Selection of Works by Contemporary Famous Calligraphers Published

Recently, the Qingdao Publishing House has presented a gift to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "A Selection of Works by Contemporary Famous Calligraphers."

"A Selection of Works by Contemporary Famous Calligraphers" is edited by Xu Li.

The book includes 66 pieces of exquisite works by contemporary Chinese calligraphers. It features not only the masterpieces of senior calligraphy masters but also the fine works of middle-aged and young calligraphers.

The book also includes works by famous calligraphers from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The selection features seal script, clerical script, running script, cursive script, and regular script, each with distinct styles, allowing readers to appreciate the splendor of contemporary Eastern art.

Today, Qi Gong, the president of the Chinese Calligraphers Association, praised the publication of the selection as "a great thing" at a release seminar held in the Great Hall of the People, saying it is "a criticism of national nihilism."

Comrade Xi Zhongxun and other responsible comrades attended to offer congratulations.
