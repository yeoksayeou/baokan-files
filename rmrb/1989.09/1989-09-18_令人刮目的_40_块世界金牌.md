    40 World Gold Medals That Command Respect
    “Guangxi produces athletic talents.” This is the praise from people in other provinces for Guangxi’s sports community. Indeed, in the 40 years since liberation, Guangxi’s sports achievements have been remarkable: 40 world championships, 41 Asian Games championships, and 410 national championships. Athletes have broken world records 14 times, Asian records 15 times, and national records 301 times.

    Guangxi’s sports achievements are mainly due to leveraging the region’s unique “heaven, earth, and people” advantages: first, its subtropical location means no harsh winters, making it ideal for training; second, the numerous rivers and lakes, especially in the southern part of Guangxi, allow for year-round swimming; third, Guangxi people have a physique characterized by agility, speed, and a small build; fourth, Guangxi’s youth mature early. Based on these characteristics, Guangxi has focused on gymnastics, acrobatics, short-distance running, and agility events in track and field, as well as small-ball and lightweight categories like table tennis, badminton, weightlifting, and wrestling, and water sports such as swimming, diving, water polo, and fin swimming.

    At the 23rd Olympic Games, Guangxi athletes ranked first in both gold and total medals among all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. At the 24th Olympic Games, Guangxi athletes ranked fourth nationally, producing famous athletes such as Li Ning, Wu Shude, Xie Saike, Li Kongzheng, and Wei Qingguang. Up to this year, Guangxi has always been among the recipients of national awards and honors by the State Sports Commission.

　　令人刮目的40块世界金牌
    “广西出体育尖子。”这是外省人对广西体育界的赞誉。确实，解放40年来，广西体育界成绩令人刮目：夺得世界冠军40个，亚运会冠军41个，全国冠军410个。体育健儿14次破世界纪录，15次破亚洲纪录，301次打破全国纪录。
    广西体育的腾飞，主要是抓住了广西“天、地、人”的特点和优势：一是地处亚热带，冬无严寒，适宜运动训练；二是江河水域多，桂南一带四季可游泳；三是广西的人体素质具有灵、快、小特点；四是广西的青少年成熟期早。根据这些特点，广西重点抓体操、技巧、田径短跑灵巧性项目，乒乓球、羽毛球、举重、摔跤等小球类、小级别项目和游泳、跳水、水球、蹼泳等水上项目。
    在第23届奥运会上，广西选手获得金牌、奖牌数均排全国各省市区第一位。第24届奥运会广西选手成绩在全国排第四位，涌现了李宁、吴数德、谢赛克、李孔政、韦晴光等著名体坛精英。直到今年为止，国家体委每次全国性的表彰和颁奖，广西都在受奖之列。
