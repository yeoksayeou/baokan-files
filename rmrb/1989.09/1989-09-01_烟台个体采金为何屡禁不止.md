Recently, I witnessed in the Jiao Dong gold coast that some individual gold miners are still recklessly mining, abandoning poor-quality ores, and engaging in excessive blasting and theft of gold resources.

Before the state implemented protective mining of gold resources, Yantai City had already issued a notice to the entire city prohibiting individual gold mining. However, the effect has been minimal over the past few years. Apart from the public's weak awareness of legal mining and local protectionism, there are also policy and economic reasons. In the past, the policy was "state, collective, and individual all participate," "large mines are fully exploited, small mines are partially exploited, and water flows quickly." The people tasted the sweetness, and now it is difficult to reverse this policy. In Chifeng County, the Linglong Gold Mine organized personnel to block all entrances to the mine area and conducted round-the-clock patrols, which controlled some of the outflow of ore. However, it was ineffective against the "guerrilla" gold miners who come and go as they please. Some village-run mines are operated through contracts, which are then subcontracted multiple times. Some are even contracted to farmers from other counties or provinces, with the village only collecting fees and not managing anything else. These individual miners, operating under the guise of collective enterprises, are mining within the legal boundaries of state-owned mines, directly affecting the normal production of the mines. It is understood that currently, gold mining is still the main economic source for some villages in Jiao Dong, which is also an important reason why individual gold mining is difficult to eradicate.

In addition, some places issue mining permits illegally, which has led to negative consequences. In Qixia County, Sujiadian Village in Sujiadian Township issued permits and collected fees indiscriminately, turning illegal individual gold mining into "legal" operations.

Regarding this, a deputy county magistrate of Chifeng County said that to completely eradicate individual gold mining, the following issues must be addressed: First, there must be specific regulations for punishing illegal gold miners; second, strict law enforcement must be implemented, and the gold mining public security bureau, police stations, and industrial and commercial departments' gold smuggling teams must be strengthened to severely crack down on illegal gold mining and gold smuggling, completely clean up underground refining plants, and prevent gold from flowing out; third, the gold mine management system must be improved, the approval of new village-run gold mines must be stopped, and gold mining points that are collectively owned but individually operated must be shut down.

    烟台个体采金为何屡禁不止
    最近，我在胶东黄金海岸目睹一些个体采金者仍在滥采乱挖、采富弃贫、狂轰滥炸、明偷暗抢黄金矿产。
    国家对黄金矿产实行保护性开采以前，烟台市就通告全市禁止个体采金，但几年来收效不大。这除了群众依法采矿观念淡漠以及地方本位主义作怪以外，还有政策、经济上的原因。过去是“国家、集体、个人一起上”，“大矿大开、小矿小开、有水快流”放开采，老百姓尝到了甜头，现在要收回，难度很大。招远县玲珑金矿组织人员封锁矿区各通道口，昼夜值班，虽控制了一部分矿石外流，但对那些“你来我走，你走我来”的采金“游击队”仍无济于事。还有一些村办矿山搞承包，并且一转再转，有的甚至包给外县、外省农民，村里只收费，其他什么也不管。这些打着集体招牌的个体采金者，在国营矿山法定范围内竞相开采，直接影响矿山的正常生产。据了解，目前采金仍是胶东地区一些乡村的主要经济来源，这也是个体采金难以取缔的一个重要原因。
    此外，个别地方私自乱发采矿许可证，也造成了不良后果。栖霞县苏家店乡苏家店村乱发证、乱收费，使个体采金由非法转为“合法”。
    对此，招远县一位副县长说，要彻底取缔个体采金，必须解决以下几个问题：一、对违法采金者的处罚要有具体的法规；二、严明法纪，健全矿山黄金公安局、派出所及工商部门的黄金缉私队伍，严厉打击违法采金及黄金走私，彻底清理地下选炼厂，防止黄金外流；三、健全金矿管理机构，停止审批新开办的村办金矿，取缔名为集体、实为个体的采金点。
