They are true men,
They can drink alcohol from a large teacup in big gulps,
They can play pure songs on the guitar.
They are the sun of toil,
Every day, a black lyrical melody is played on their bodies.
The northern sun is also fiery,
The northern sun is the temperament of a man.
The road is always so distant,
But the horizon of hope is like a dream,
Sometimes far, sometimes near.
Their youthful chests are filled with endless energy,
But they fear loneliness,
They fear the long nights.
They love the stars,
Just as they love a hazy poem,
But their hearts are as clear as a mirror.
They are a group of true men.
The highway is carried on their broad shoulders.
Their young hearts are the sun of the republic,
A young republic,
An impassioned note.
The highway is their released white dove,
A colorful ribbon in the dawn,
An epic film.
Generation after generation has passed,
Passed,
Playing the symphony of life with surveying rods and pickaxes.
