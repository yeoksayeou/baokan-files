As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic approaches, my thoughts are numerous. As a scientific and technological worker, I am always concerned about not living up to the people's expectations and the country's trust. Although I cannot express my feelings like a poet, the memories that are deeply etched in my heart are unforgettable. In the midst of my hard work and ordinary daily life, they often trigger profound thoughts.

In 1955, I wore a red scarf and entered Peking University with a childish ideal. Three months later, one evening, I participated in a commemorative meeting for the 20th anniversary of the December 9th Movement held in the Hall of Remembrance in Zhongnanhai. At eleven o'clock in the evening, Premier Zhou Enlai came to our venue. He had just finished talks with the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, and rushed over. The students eagerly hoped that Premier Zhou would say a few words. Premier Zhou said, "It's not just a few words, I have a lot to say." Students, I envy you because you are growing up in an era when you can personally build your own country. The era that our predecessors fought for is like this. The Chinese nation has been lonely for too long in history. Our motherland will become prosperous and strong in your hands and make the contributions it should to the world. After a two-hour speech full of passion, Premier Zhou led us to sing the "March of the Volunteers." We left the Hall of Remembrance with tears in our eyes at two in the morning.

Time flies. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's science and technology has become more prosperous and flourishing on the basis of its original development. In the spring of 1986, under the organization of the State Science and Technology Commission, I went to Geneva with the Chinese Invention Association delegation to participate in the International Invention Exhibition. At this grand event, the Chinese delegation won 36 medals, including 6 gold medals, as well as the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization Award and the grand prize previously only awarded to Westerners—the Geneva State Award. I received the Geneva State Award. The Geneva State Government held a grand celebration for Chinese inventors in the Alabama Hall of the State Parliament. Governor Glovett delivered a passionate speech, saying: "In this hall, many major historical events have taken place. The International Red Cross was established here, and the Geneva Conventions were signed here in 1954. Premier Zhou Enlai sat here at that time. It is most appropriate to congratulate the achievements of Chinese inventors here." The eyes of the Chinese inventors in the hall shone with tears of happiness, and my heart seemed to fly back to that night in the Hall of Remembrance more than thirty years ago. The scientific and technological workers of socialist China hope to personally raise their trophies to the world. The day we have been waiting for has finally come.

In the spring of 1987, I went to Geneva for the second time and won a gold medal again. An elderly man living in Lausanne, despite being 75 years old, drove 100 kilometers to give me a flag of the Swiss Confederation. He said, "I saw your inventions and also knew about China's awards. Fifty years ago, I went to Shanghai, China. This time, I saw a completely different China. I sincerely congratulate you!" Feeling the deep affection of a foreigner for our motherland in a foreign land, a special sense of happiness surged in my heart. The world sometimes makes you excited, and sometimes it makes you feel heavy-hearted. In the center of Washington, not far from the White House, there is an American History Museum. Among its exhibits is a strange one. It reproduces the exhibits from the 1876 International Exposition in Philadelphia for today's audience, including British trains, German machine tools, and American generators from that time. The Qing government also sent exhibits, but they were small-foot women's embroidered shoes, handmade ear picks, and palace toys, with nothing that could compare with Western industrial civilization. China was then estranged from science. Seeing all this, I deeply felt the heavy burden on the shoulders of today's Chinese scientific and technological workers. Due to historical reasons, we are late in the international scientific and technological competition, and some projects have started much later than others. To win, we must pay double the wisdom and double the sweat. This heavy-hearted feeling can inspire a sense of mission, making oneself diligent and not daring to be lazy.

In October 1987, I was again invited to participate in the Invention Exhibition and academic exchange in the Federal Republic of Germany. I brought 10 of the latest inventions in the field of sensor technology. The enthusiastic hosts placed our exhibits in the most eye-catching spot in the central hall of the parliament. The international jury unanimously decided to award the highest prize of the exhibition—the gold medal with the goddess of victory—to me. After the award ceremony, a reporter from the Saarbrücken radio station hoped I would say a few words. I couldn't help but think of the 1876 Philadelphia International Exposition. The stark contrast in history highlighted the great changes in our motherland. The achievements of our motherland include my own sweat, and I felt infinitely gratified. Taking the microphone, I said the two sentences I most wanted to say: "The Chinese nation has had brilliant achievements in the history of science. Contemporary Chinese scientific and technological workers will create happiness for mankind with their blood and wisdom and add glory to the motherland."

　　忘不了怀仁堂里那一夜
　　北京机械工业自动化研究所　张开逊
    国庆40周年来到之际，我思绪万千。作为一个科技工作者，埋头在实验室，所虑所忧总是唯恐有负人民的厚望与祖国的重托。我虽不会以诗人的激扬挥洒心中的豪情，然而，深印在心中的往事，难以忘怀，在辛劳而平凡的日常工作中，常常触发深沉的联想。
    1955年，我系着红领巾，带着稚气的理想进入北京大学。3个月之后的一天晚上，我参加了在中南海怀仁堂举行的“一二·九”运动二十周年纪念会。晚上十一点，周恩来总理来到了我们的会场，他是刚刚结束同民主德国总理格罗提渥会谈赶来的。同学们热切希望周总理讲几句话。周总理说，不是讲几句话，我有很多话要讲。同学们，我羡慕你们，因为你们生长在可以亲手建设自己祖国的时代，先辈为之奋斗的就是这样的时代。中华民族在历史上寂寞的时间已经太长了，我们的祖国将在你们这一代人的手中变得繁荣富强，为世界做出应有的贡献。在长达两个小时饱含激情的讲话之后，周总理指挥我们一起高唱义勇军进行曲，我们含着热泪离开怀仁堂的时候，已经是凌晨两点了。
    弹指一挥间。党的十一届三中全会后，我国科学技术在原有的发展基础上，更加繁荣昌盛。1986年春天，在国家科委组织下，我随中国发明协会代表团到日内瓦参加国际发明展览。这次盛会上，中国代表团获得36枚奖牌，其中有6枚金牌，还有联合国知识产权组织奖和从前只授予过西方人的大奖——日内瓦州奖。我，获得了日内瓦州奖。日内瓦州政府在州议会阿拉巴马大厅为中国发明家举行了隆重的庆祝会。州长格洛贝特先生发表了热情洋溢的讲话，他说：“在这个大厅里，发生过许多重大的历史事件，国际红十字会在这里宣告成立，1954年日内瓦公约是在这里签字的，周恩来总理当年就坐在这里。在这里祝贺中国发明家的成就，是再合适不过了。”大厅里的中国发明家眼睛里闪着幸福的泪，我的心仿佛飞向了三十多年前怀仁堂里的那一夜。社会主义祖国的科技工作者多么希望亲手向世界举起自己的奖杯，我们盼望的这一天终于实现了。
    1987年春天，我第二次到日内瓦，又获得了金奖。一位住在洛桑的老人，不顾75岁高龄驱车100公里，送给我一面瑞士联邦共和国国旗。他说：“我看到了你们的发明，也知道了中国获奖的消息。50年前我到过中国的上海，这次我看到了一个完全不同的中国。衷心地祝贺你们！”在异国他乡真切地感受到一个外国人对我们祖国的深情，一种特殊的幸福感涌上心头。世界给人的感受有时使你兴奋，有时又使你的心情沉重。在华盛顿市中心离白宫不远的地方，有一个美国历史博物馆，其中有一个稀奇的展览。它把1876年在费城举办国际博览会的展品原封不动地再现给今天的观众，其中有当年英国的火车、德国的机床和美国的发电机。清政府也送去了展品，却是小脚女人的绣花鞋、手工打制的耳挖勺和宫廷玩物，唯独没有可以和西方工业文明媲美的科技成果，中国在当时是和科学无缘的。看到这一切，我深感今天中国科技工作者肩上担子的沉重。由于历史的原因，我们在国际科学技术的竞赛场上迟到了，有的项目起跑线比别人拉后了许多，要赢得胜利，只有付出双倍的智慧和双倍的汗水。这种沉重的心情能够催发人的使命感，使自己兢兢业业，不敢懈怠。
    1987年10月，我又应邀到德意志联邦共和国参加发明展览和学术交流。我带去了在传感技术领域完成的10件最新发明。热情的主人把我们的展品安置在议会大厅中央最注目的地方，国际评审委员会的专家一致决定把本届展览的最高奖——镶嵌着胜利女神的金质大奖授予我。授奖仪式之后，萨尔布吕肯市电台记者希望我讲几句话。我不禁又想起了那个1876年费城国际博览会，强烈的历史反差，衬映出祖国的巨大变化，祖国的成就里有自己的一滴汗水，感到无限欣慰。接过话筒，我讲了两句最想说的话：“中华民族在科学史上有过光辉的业绩。当代的中国科技工作者将以心血和智慧为人类创造幸福，为祖国增添光荣。”
