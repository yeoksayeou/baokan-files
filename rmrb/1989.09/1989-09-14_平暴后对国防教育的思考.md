The recent turmoil this spring and summer has first and foremost taught us the necessity of having a clear class struggle consciousness. However, we must also acknowledge the impact of the mistakes made in education, including national defense education.

Comprehensively and Accurately Grasping the Scientific Connotation of National Defense and National Defense Education

From the perspective of Marxism, national defense refers to the defense of a nation, which is an independent and autonomous state. To safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security, and to defend against external aggression and subversion, a nation adopts a series of measures that are primarily military but also include political, economic, diplomatic, scientific, and cultural aspects. If national defense is understood solely as military construction, it is clearly narrow-minded and biased. National defense is a scientific system and an important component of the entire social activity. This broad concept of national defense differs from the narrow concept in that it views national defense from the perspective of enhancing comprehensive national power. If national defense is seen as merely related to the military, it is easy to view national defense construction as an "extra burden" unrelated to the two civilizations.

The scientific system of national defense determines the scientific scope of national defense education. The educational objects should be all citizens of the People's Republic; the educational content should include all aspects of national defense construction, such as the relationship between the state and national defense, the history and current status of our national defense, the relationship between economic construction and national defense construction, our national defense modernization, the characteristics of future wars and war mobilization, and the construction of national defense reserve forces; the educational time should be "all-weather," not just relying on certain holidays to write some ceremonial articles; the educational purpose should see its long-term strategic significance, not just understanding it as supporting the troops or favoring military families.

In our national defense education, there is also the issue of comprehensively expounding the functions of the military. The Constitution stipulates that our armed forces have both the function of defending against external aggression and the function of safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people and suppressing treason and other counter-revolutionary activities. However, some people view the troops' execution of martial law as "treasonous" and try every means to obstruct it. This is closely related to the fact that national defense education is not frequent and not comprehensive.

The Core of National Defense Education is Patriotic Education

The ultimate goal of national defense education is to instill a sense of patriotism in people. Throughout history, in the complex system of moral norms, patriotism has always been regarded as the highest moral norm and code of conduct. Whether one is patriotic is the touchstone for measuring people's right and wrong, honor and disgrace. The national defense education we advocate is to instill a spirit of patriotism in people, to make them understand our country's past, present, and future, to foster a strong sense of national pride, and to foster a strong love for the Communist Party, for socialist China, and for the pillar of people's democratic dictatorship, the People's Liberation Army. This is the core of national defense education. The patriotism we advocate refers to loving the socialist China led by the Communist Party. The Chinese revolution and construction can only be led by the Communist Party and can only follow the socialist path, which is determined by the law of historical development. The patriotism we advocate is linked to the sense of responsibility for defending the motherland. This is a very high spiritual realm. It can be said that the national cohesion and centripetal force aroused by national defense education are a great spiritual wealth. If national defense education is done well, the people's ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural quality will be improved, which will not only have a good influence on loving and supporting the military but also be an important spiritual pillar for economic construction, for maintaining a stable and united situation, and for social stability.

National defense consciousness is a component of people's worldview. Only those with a materialist view of history can establish a socialist patriotism. The facts show that where national defense education is done well, people have a high patriotic enthusiasm, trust the Party, love socialism, and show great concern and care for the soldiers. Those who advocate bourgeois liberalization, advocate political pluralism, and economic privatization, where is there any room for national and ethnic interests?

Emphasize the Knowledge and Practicality of National Defense Education

The formation of the people's national defense consciousness largely depends on the systematic and comprehensive imparting of knowledge. During the war years, it was the bloody slaughter of imperialism that awakened people and made them deeply feel that "the Chinese nation is in the most dangerous time." In peacetime, people's national defense consciousness is prone to weaken. In this situation, it is difficult to achieve results by just talking about abstract principles or using "situational stimulation." Practice tells us that only by constantly and widely imparting national defense knowledge to the people can we establish a broad concept of national defense. National defense knowledge is very extensive, covering many fields, such as ancient, modern, Chinese, foreign, military, political, etc., and it is all-encompassing. In education, different levels should be distinguished according to people's cultural level, work nature, acceptance ability, and psychological quality, and different methods should be used to carry out lively and interesting propaganda and education. Some basic knowledge should be started from young people, and its content should be integrated into the textbooks of primary school students.

National defense knowledge is not only a theoretical knowledge but also a very practical knowledge of actual struggle, closely related to all aspects of the world. Since the Second World War, local wars and armed conflicts have not stopped, and the efforts to stop the war are still ongoing. Therefore, national defense education not only has static theoretical and historical knowledge education but also has dynamic education on the international and domestic class struggle situation. This education requires constant attention to the current situation of international political, economic, and military struggles, understanding the changes in the international strategic situation, and the rise and fall of various political forces, linking our national defense education with the international environment, and making national defense education have a strong practical significance.

National defense knowledge comes from rich social practice, such as national defense construction, national defense industry, strategic material production, national defense science and technology development, national defense transportation conditions, and the quality of soldiers, which are all closely related to national defense and are constantly developing in social practice. Therefore, we should combine national defense education with social practice, such as participating in military training activities, organizing activities to support and favor military families, protecting national defense facilities, participating in militia training, organizing university students' military training, and even visiting military exhibitions and holding national defense knowledge competitions. Only through specific social practice activities can we make people personally practice, turning national defense issues into practical activities of thousands and thousands of people.

　　平暴后对国防教育的思考
    郑念群
    今年春夏之交的一场风波，首先告诉我们必须有一个清醒的阶级斗争观念。然而，我们也不能不看到教育其中包括国防教育的失误所造成的影响。
    全面准确地把握国防
  及国防教育的科学内涵
    按照马克思主义的观点，国防就是国家的防务，是一个独立自主的国家，为保卫主权、领土完整和安全，防御外来侵略和颠覆所采取的以军事为主体，包括与军事有关的政治、经济、外交、科技、文化等方面的一切措施的总和。如果把国防仅理解为军队建设，显然是偏颇的狭隘的。国防是一个科学体系，是整个社会活动的重要组成部分。这种大国防观念，与狭隘的国防观念的原则区别在于，它是从增强综合国力来看待国防。如果把国防看成仅仅是与军队有关的事，极易把国防建设看成与两个文明建设关系不大的“额外负担”。
    国防的科学体系决定了国防教育的科学范畴。教育对象，应当是人民共和国的全体公民；教育内容，应当包括国防建设的方方面面，如国家与国防的关系、我国国防的历史与现状、经济建设与国防建设的关系、我国的国防现代化、未来战争特点及战争动员，以及国防后备力量建设等；教育时间，应当是“全天候的”，不能只靠某些节日作点应景文章；教育目的应当看到它长远的战略意义，不能仅理解为支持部队或拥军优属。
    在我们的国防教育中，还有一个全面论述军队职能的问题。宪法规定，我国武装力量既有对外防御的职能，又有对内保卫人民和平劳动，镇压叛国和其他反革命活动的职能。但是，有人对部队执行戒严任务，看作是“大逆不道”，千方百计地进行阻拦。这与国防教育的不经常、不全面有着重要的关系。
      国防教育的核心是爱国主义教育
      国防教育的最终目的是要人们树立爱国观念。古往今来，无论哪个民族，在内容繁杂的道德规范体系中，历来把爱国视为最高的道德规范和行为准则。是否爱国，是衡量人们是非荣辱的试金石。我们讲的国防教育就是要人们具有爱国主义精神，使人们了解我们国家的过去、现在和未来，树立强烈的民族自豪感，树立热爱共产党、热爱社会主义祖国、热爱人民民主专政柱石中国人民解放军的强烈感情。这是国防教育的核心。而我们所讲的爱国主义，是指热爱中国共产党领导的社会主义中国。中国革命和建设，只能由共产党领导，只能走社会主义道路，这是历史发展的规律决定的。我们讲的爱国观念是同保卫祖国的责任感联系在一起的。这是一种非常高的精神境界。可以说，国防教育所唤起的民族向心力和凝聚力，是巨大的精神财富。国防教育搞好了，人民的思想道德素质和科学文化素质提高了，不仅对爱国拥军产生良好影响，而且对经济建设，对维护安定团结的局面和社会稳定，也是重要的精神支柱。
    国防观念是人们世界观的一个组成部分。具有唯物史观的人才能树立社会主义的爱国观念。事实说明，凡是国防教育搞得好的地方，人们就有很高的爱国热情，信任党，热爱社会主义，对子弟兵表现了极大的关心和爱护。而鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，主张政治上多元化，经济上私有化，哪里还有国家、民族利益可言。
      要注重国防教育的
      知识性和实践性
    人民群众国防观念的形成，在很大程度上依赖于全面的系统的知识灌输。战争年代，是帝国主义的血腥屠杀，唤醒了人们的觉醒，深切地感到“中华民族到了最危险的时候”。和平时期，人们国防观念易于淡薄。在这种情况下，只讲空道理是很难奏效的，用“情况刺激”也不是办法。实践告诉我们，只有经常地广泛地向人民群众灌输国防知识，才能树立大国防观念。国防知识内容很广泛，涉及的领域很多，如古代的、现代的、中国的、外国的、军事的、政治的等等，无所不包。教育中，应根据人们的文化水平、工作性质、接受能力、心理素质等方面的不同，区别不同的层次，运用不同方法，进行生动活泼的宣传教育。有些基本知识要从青少年抓起，其内容要贯穿在小学生的课本之中。
      国防知识，不只是一门理论知识，而且是十分现实的实际斗争知识，同世界各方面的现实紧密相联。第二次世界大战以来，局部战争和武装冲突没有间断，制止战争力量的增长需要继续努力。因之，国防教育不只有静态的理论的历史的知识教育，还有动态的国际国内阶级斗争形势的教育。这种教育，需要时时注视国际政治、经济、军事斗争的现状，了解国际战略局势的变化以及各种政治力量的消长，把我们的国防教育同国际大环境联系起来，使国防教育具有强烈的现实意义。
    国防知识来自丰富的社会实践，比如国防建设、国防工业、战略物资生产、国防科技发展、国防交通状况以及兵员的素质等，这些与国防有密切关联的诸多方面，都是在社会实践中不断发展的。因之我们进行国防教育，要同社会实践结合起来，如参加军训活动，组织拥军优属活动，保护国防设施，参加民兵训练，组织大学生军训，以至参观军事展览、举办国防知识竞赛等。只有通过具体的社会实践活动，使人们亲身实践，才能把国防问题，变成千百万人的实践活动。
