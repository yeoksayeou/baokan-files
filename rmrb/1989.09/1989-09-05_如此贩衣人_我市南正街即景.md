Such a Clothes Peddler
— A Scene from South Zheng Street in Our City

	(On a cardboard box, a few wool vests are laid out)
	Fat Clothes Peddler: Come and buy! Pure wool embroidered vests from Inner Mongolia, awarded the silver prize by the Ministry of Light Industry, 28.5 yuan each. Not pure, no money back!
	Supporting Woman: (She puts the vest on) Can you make it cheaper? 23 yuan, will you sell it?
	Fat Clothes Peddler: No sale, no discount, genuine goods, no price reduction.
	(Two middle-aged rural women approach)
	Woman A: How much is one piece?
	Fat Clothes Peddler: 28.5 yuan.
	Woman B: Too expensive, can you lower the price?
	Fat Clothes Peddler: Oh, this is pure wool, over 200 yuan per pound. Too expensive? You can buy a sack to wear!
	(Several young urban women, each holding a vest)
	Young Woman: How much is one piece?
	Fat Clothes Peddler: 23 yuan, not a cent less, the lowest price in the city, the most fashionable in the country.
	(In the distance, a skinny clothes peddler rushes over)
	Skinny Clothes Peddler: Quick, pack it up, the "Industry and Commerce" officials are coming! (He snatches the vests from the customers' hands, stuffs them into a black bag, and hides to the side.)
	Fat Clothes Peddler: Come and buy! 15 yuan per piece of wool vest, a rare opportunity!
	(Everyone is astonished)
	Fat Clothes Peddler: (Embarrassed) Sisters, you don't know, our clothes are not taxed. If the "Industry and Commerce" officials find out, they will fine us. Please understand!
	Narrator: Who knows how much each piece is worth.

    如此贩衣人
    ——我市南正街即景
    （纸箱上摆着几件羊毛背心）
    胖衣贩：快来买呀，内蒙古产的纯羊毛绣花背心，获轻工部银质奖，28元5角一件。不纯不要钱！
    帮腔女人：（她将背心穿在身上）便宜点，23元卖不卖？
    胖衣贩：不卖不卖，一分不少，正宗货，不降价。
    （走来两名中年农村妇女）
    妇女甲：师傅，多少钱一件？
    胖衣贩：28元5角。
    妇女乙：太贵了，能不能少点？
    胖衣贩：哎呀，这是纯羊毛，两百多块钱一斤。嫌贵，你买麻袋穿吧！
    （几名城里少妇一人拿一件背心）
    一少妇：几块钱一件啦？
    胖衣贩：23元，一分不少，全市最低价，全国最时髦。
    （在远处望风的瘦衣贩急忙跑来）
    瘦衣贩：快收起来，“工商”来了（边说边抢走顾客手上的几件背心，往黑提袋里一塞，躲到一边去了）。
    胖衣贩：快来买呀，15元一件的羊毛背心，机会难得呀。
    （众人愕然）
    胖衣贩：（尴尬地）姐姐们不知，我们的衣服没有打税，“工商”发现了要罚款，请诸位谅解！
    话外音：天晓得值多少钱一件。
