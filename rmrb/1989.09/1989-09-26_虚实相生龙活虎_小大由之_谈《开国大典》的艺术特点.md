Among the revolutionary historical films of recent years, "The Founding Ceremony" is undoubtedly the most successful. It breaks away from the cliché of making revolutionary leaders stand out and perform solo acts, and avoids the passive narration of piling up events. Instead, it treats historical heroes as ordinary people in the historical process and showcases the nature and significance of human activities in the historical movement, making history a history of people and people a part of the historical process. For example, the character of Chiang Kai-shek is depicted as someone who goes against the historical trend and acts against the interests of the country and the nation. The film also portrays his ordinary emotions of heroism waning and filial piety. His cunning, irresponsible political attitude towards history, and his philosophy of history are revealed through his seclusion, mockery of Li Zongren, use of Zhang Zhizhong, playing mahjong for the commander of the Jiangbei Defense, and conversations with his son, forming a relatively complete character and thought system. There is no need for the creator to praise or criticize; through his series of actions towards Li Zongren, the audience will have a clear understanding of this traditional philosopher-like feudal monarch figure and his responsibility for China's history. This historical portrayal, including the use of parallel montage structure to handle the activities of both the Nationalists and the Communists, places all characters equally on the stage of history, bringing about a change in aesthetic rhythm and leaving room for the audience to think and evaluate. This is a major feature or success of the film.

Another feature of this film is its free and unrestrained handling of the plot. The film involves many characters and complex events, with both political and military struggles, which could easily turn into a mere account of events. However, the director consciously uses the principle of the interplay of reality and fantasy and the balance of big and small in Chinese classical aesthetics, boldly omitting the narration of specific events, and focusing on the different mindsets and behaviors of various people during the historical turning point. With the future of China as the warp and the reactions of different people to China's destiny as the weft, like pearls on a string, the entire film becomes a complete artistic whole with layers and a three-dimensional feel. This is like the "shrinking a dragon to an inch" and "moving the heavens and shrinking the earth" in traditional Chinese art, containing the past and present within a small space, swallowing mountains and rivers, with both a bird's-eye view of the world and meticulous carving. For example, the details of Mao Zedong's conversation with Peng Xian, Mao Zedong's meeting with his hometown people, the negotiations between the Communist Party and the Nationalists, the Communist Party's attitude towards Zhang Zhizhong and other negotiators, and even Mao Zedong's incognito outing, are all handled delicately, not only with a strong sense of human touch but also with a strong philosophical flavor, playing a crucial role in expressing the thoughts, attitudes, stances, and realms of the two opposing groups on the core issue of the nation's future. As for the major battle scenes and the decision-making and action processes of specific events, the film simply touches on them and stops. This artistic handling of big strokes and small details makes the work concise yet rich, producing the aesthetic effect of "a speck of dust in a world of chaos," "calculating white and guarding black," and "the interplay of reality and fantasy" in Chinese painting. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a powerful work that combines thought and art, subjective will, and objective effect.

Of course, "The Founding Ceremony" focuses on depicting people, so the lifelike portrayal of characters is also a prominent feature, an artistic goal that the director and actors strive for, which needs no further elaboration.

However, perhaps because the director and actors are devoted to portraying the complexity of people in ordinary life details, I have a feeling that the film's structure is not tight or the theme is not prominent enough. That is to say, a string of pearls has not been carefully strung together with a golden thread but is rolling freely. The handling of details as individual shots and artistic units is quite successful, but some details seem to serve only to express the character's personality or the mindset of a specific situation, neglecting the connection of this detail to the film's main line or overall background. This connection can sometimes be achieved by adding a line of dialogue.

Additionally, the film's ending does not seem to form a climax. This climax should be the founding of the People's Republic of China, a specific moment in the turning point of Chinese history. October 1, 1949, means the victory of the Chinese people's revolution since 1840 and the turning point in the destiny of the Chinese nation. This specific historical significance is not sufficiently expressed in the film. The current ending has become a narrative of the process of an event, which does not harmonize well with the overall style and logical development of the film's theme.

As the saying goes, "One cannot have both fish and bear's paw." Moreover, "The Founding Ceremony" has already done its best to balance the completeness and unity of the film. Despite some oversights, I believe this film will receive unanimous praise from the general audience and professional filmmakers. Because it is not only a philosophical and thought-provoking Chinese revolutionary history textbook but also an artistic work full of passion and wisdom that is worth appreciating.

    虚实相生龙活虎  小大由之
    ——谈《开国大典》的艺术特点
    曾　凡
    在近年来的革命历史题材影片中，《开国大典》无疑是最成功的一部。它摆脱了让革命领袖鹤立鸡群唱独角戏的俗套，也避免了堆砌事件的被动叙述，而是把历史英雄和普通人一样作为历史过程中的一员，并在历史运动过程中展示人的活动的性质和意义，使历史成为人的历史，使人成为历史过程中的人。比如蒋介石这个角色，影片既写他逆历史潮流而动，违背国家和民族的利益而行事，也写他英雄气短、儿女情长的普通感情。而他的狡黠老滑、对历史不负责任的政治态度、历史哲学等，则通过隐居、嘲弄李宗仁、利用张治中、替江防司令打麻将、父子对话等，构成一种较完整的性格和思想体系。无须创作者褒贬，仅仅通过对待李宗仁的一系列言行，观众就会对这个深通传统哲学的封建君主式人物以及他对中国历史应付的责任有一个明确的认识了。这种历史化的描写，包括用平行蒙太奇结构处理国共双方的活动，把所有角色平等地置于历史的舞台，既带来美学上的节奏变化，又为观众留下了思考和评价的权力。这是影片的一个主要特点或成功。
    这部影片的另一个特点是其情节处理的挥洒自如。影片涉及的人物众多、事件庞杂，既有政治斗争又有军事斗争，很容易变成流水帐。但编导有意识地运用了中国古典美学虚实相生、小中见大的原理，大胆舍弃了对具体事件的交待叙述，而集中笔墨于各色人等在历史转折过程中的不同心态和行为。以中国的前途为经，以不同的人对中国前途命运的反应为纬，如珍珠串线，使全片成为一个有层次、有立体感的完整的艺术整体。这就像中国传统艺术中所说的“缩龙成寸”、“移天缩地”之法，尺幅之内，容纳古今，吞吐山河，既有俯瞰人间的气势，又有纤毫毕现的精雕细刻。比如毛泽东与程潜谈话、毛泽东会见老乡、共产党与国民党谈判、共产党对张治中和其他谈判代表的态度，甚至毛泽东微服上街，这些细节都处理得很细腻，不但有很浓的人情味，也有很浓的哲理味，对表现两大对立集团在对待民族前途这个核心问题上的思想、态度、立场、境界等等，起到了画龙点睛的作用。而对于重大的战争场面、具体事件的决策和行动过程，影片则一笔带过，点到即止。这种大处挥洒小处点染的艺术处理使作品显得简捷而丰满，产生了中国画中“一点尘劫、一墨大千”、“计白守黑”、“虚实相生”的审美效果。所以，它无疑是一部思想和艺术、主观意愿与客观效果结合得比较好的得力之作。
    当然，《开国大典》以写人为中心，所以角色塑造的生活化显然也是一个突出特点，是编导演都孜孜以求的艺术目标，这里就无须多说。
    不过，可能正因为编导者倾心于在平凡的生活细节中表现人的复杂性，所以我有一种影片结构不紧密或是主题不够突出的感觉。也就是说，一盘珍珠并没有被一根金线很细致地串在一起，而是自由地滚动着。影片细节处理作为单个镜头和艺术单元都比较成功，但似乎有些细节的处理只起到了表现人物性格或某一具体情境中心态的作用，而忽略了这一细节同影片主线或整体背景的联系。而这种联系有时只要增加一句台词就会做到。
    另外，影片的结尾似乎也没有形成高潮。这个高潮应当是中华人民共和国成立，是中国历史转折的一个特定瞬间。一九四九年十月一日，这意味着从一八四○年以来的中国人民革命的胜利，意味着中华民族命运的历史转折。这一时刻的特定历史涵义在影片中没有足够的表现。现在的结尾又成了一次事件的过程性叙述，与全片的风格和影片主题的逻辑发展没有达到很好的谐调。
    俗云：鱼与熊掌不可兼得。何况《开国大典》已经尽可能地兼顾了影片的完整统一。尽管有一些疏漏，但我相信这部影片一定会得到广大观众和专业电影工作者的一致好评。因为，它不仅是一部有哲理、有思想深度的中国革命史教材，而且还是一部充满激情和智慧的引人玩味的艺术作品。
