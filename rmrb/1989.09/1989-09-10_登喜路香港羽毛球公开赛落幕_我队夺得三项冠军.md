**Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 10th.**

After four days of intense competition, the Hong Kong Open Badminton Tournament concluded with all the gold medals decided. Today, in the finals, Chinese athletes secured the men's singles, women's singles, and women's doubles championships. In the men's singles, an upset occurred as the newcomer Wu Wenkai emerged victorious, defeating Malaysia's Fu Guoqiang with a 2-0 score. Han Aiping and Lin Ying/Guan Weizhen, as expected, won the women's singles and doubles titles, respectively. Women's singles newcomer Zhou Lei secured the runner-up position. World champion Yang Yang was defeated 0-2 by Fu Guoqiang in yesterday's semifinals.

The top four seeds in the men's singles did not advance to the finals, making the match between Wu Wenkai and Fu Guoqiang highly anticipated. Fu Guoqiang, riding on the momentum of his victory over Yang Yang the previous day, adopted an aggressive strategy. This 19-year-old newcomer, who recently won the men's singles title at the Second National Youth Games, commented after the match, "I didn't feel very tired." The men's doubles championship was claimed by Malaysia's formidable duo, La Sidik and Jia Sidik, while the mixed doubles title went to South Korea's Choi Sang-bum and Jeong So-young.

　　登喜路香港羽毛球公开赛落幕
　　我队夺得三项冠军
    本报香港9月10日电　记者连锦添报道：经过4天角逐，登喜路香港羽毛球公开赛决出全部金牌。中国选手在今天的决赛中夺取男单、女单和女双冠军。男单比赛爆出冷门，新秀吴文凯脱颖而出以2∶0战胜马来西亚傅国强。韩爱平、林瑛／关渭贞不出预料获女单、女双冠军。女子单打新秀周蕾获亚军。世界冠军杨阳在昨天半决赛中以0比2败在傅国强拍下。
    男单前四号种子均未进入决赛，吴文凯对傅国强一战因此备受注目。傅国强挟昨日战胜杨阳余威，采取攻势。这位刚刚在第二届全国青运会获男单冠军的19岁新秀赛后说：“打得不是很累”。男子双打冠军被马来西亚队骁将拉·西德克／贾·西德克夺得，混合双打桂冠被南朝鲜队崔相范／郑素英摘去。
