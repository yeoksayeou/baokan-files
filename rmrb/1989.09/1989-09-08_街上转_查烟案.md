    Despite its small size, our county has at least 200 cigarette vendors. The high-end cigarettes sold at these stalls are often smuggled and evade national taxes, with prices generally lower than those set by the county tobacco company. Some lesser-known brands that are hard to find in state-run stores are readily available from these vendors. For example, Red Flower brand cigarettes, which some officials can purchase with vouchers at 8.8 yuan per pack, are sold for around 4 yuan per pack by individual vendors.

    Stopping the chaos in the cigarette market is not difficult. The relevant authorities only need to send people out to the streets to inquire and investigate the origins of these cigarettes, and then take appropriate measures.

    街上转　查烟案
    我县虽小，烟贩至少有200多个。烟摊经营的高档香烟是偷漏了国税的走私烟，售价一般低于县烟草公司的定价，一些次名牌香烟在国营商店里买不着，而烟贩却有的是。如红梅牌香烟，一些干部可以批条子买到，每盒价格只有8角多，而个体烟摊却卖4元左右。
    制止香烟市场混乱现象并不困难，主管部门只要派人上街一转，加以询问，了解这些香烟的来路，然后采取相应办法就行。
