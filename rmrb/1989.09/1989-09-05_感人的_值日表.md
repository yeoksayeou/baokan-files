A yellowed duty roster in the office of the city tax bureau has caught people's attention. It reads: "To take care of the five-guarantee elderly person Xia Shuxing, the duty roster is arranged as follows..." Below, the names of the 20 staff members of the bureau are listed in order.

Xia Shuxing is a 97-year-old elderly person with no children, unable to take care of herself, and living not far from the city tax bureau. After Chen Caimao, the bureau chief, discovered Xia Shuxing's situation, he took the initiative to send water, buy rice, and vegetables for the elderly person. Soon, Chen's actions were known to other colleagues in the bureau, and they decided to share the responsibility of taking care of the five-guarantee elderly person. Since then, the 20 people in the bureau have become frequent visitors to Xia Shuxing's home. Firewood, rice, oil, and salt are bought on time for the elderly person; quilts and clothes are washed on time; during festivals, money is collected to buy chickens, fish, meat, and sweets for the elderly person. Last April, everyone donated 113 yuan to install running water for the elderly person. When the running water flowed into the elderly person's home, this five-guarantee elderly person who had experienced three dynasties, looking at the national emblem on the caps of the tax bureau staff, said excitedly: "Thanks to the Communist Party, I can still live such a good life."

To ensure the care of Xia Shuxing, the Party branch of the tax bureau decided to implement a rotating duty roster for care, and thus, this duty roster was created.

    感人的“值日表”
    我县城区税务所办公室里，一张已经发黄的值日表，引起人们的注意。它上面写着：“为照料五保老人夏秀英，特将值日护理顺序安排如下……”下面依次写着全所20名工作人员的名字。
    夏秀英，是一位97岁高龄的老人，无儿无女，生活不能自理，居住在距城区税务所不远的地方。夏秀英的情况被陈才茂所长发现后，就主动地为老人送水、买米、买菜等。不久，陈所长的这一举动又被所里其他同志知道了，于是，大家协商共同承担照料五保老人的义务。从此，所里的20个人便成了夏秀英老人家的常客。柴米油盐及时为老人买好，被褥衣服及时为老人清洗；逢年过节，凑钱为老人买鸡、鱼、肉、糖等礼品。去年4月，大家又捐资113元为老人安装了自来水。当自来水流进老人家时，这位经历三个朝代的五保老人，望着税务所同志帽上的国徽激动地说：“托共产党的福，我还能过上这样的好日子。”
    为了确保对夏秀英老人的照料，税务所党支部决定实行轮流值日护理，于是，这个值日表排列出来了。
