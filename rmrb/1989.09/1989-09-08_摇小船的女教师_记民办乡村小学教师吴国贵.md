In the hearts of the residents of the Dazhu Village in the submerged area of the Huilong Reservoir in Dazhu County, Chongqing, "Teacher Wu" is a very familiar and beloved name.

Building a School from Scratch

In July 1983, 17-year-old Wu Guogui graduated from junior high school and returned to her hometown, Dazhu Village in Huilong Township, becoming the most educated "golden phoenix" in the entire village.

Dazhu Village is located in the submerged area of the Huilong Reservoir, separated from the outside world by a 303-meter-long dam. Just 10 kilometers outside the dam lies the famous tourist destination of Dazhu Baoding Stone Carvings, bustling with visitors from home and abroad. Inside the dam, however, the scene is one of poverty. The 423 households in Dazhu Village have an annual per capita income of less than 140 yuan. The villagers live scattered on the slopes along the reservoir, farming and eating what they grow, living a life of "rising with the sun and resting with its setting." Over 70% of the village's unmarried young adults are single because the village is too poor. The local girls try desperately to marry out, while outsiders are reluctant to marry into such poverty. However, Wu Guogui did not leave. Initially, the village assigned her to teach in an adult literacy class. She saw the parents of the children sitting in the classroom while a large group of school-aged children peered in through the windows, thinking, "As soon as the older illiterates are educated, new ones grow up. When will this literacy campaign end?" That year, 11 young people from the village applied to join the army, but all were rejected. Upon inquiry, it was found that the reason was their lack of education; the army did not want them. After careful consideration, Wu Guogui proposed to the village and township leaders that a primary school be established in Dazhu Village. Her request was quickly supported by the village and township leaders, fellow villagers, and parents of the students. There were no classrooms, so the militia company commander Liu Feng offered one of his rooms, measuring less than 14 square meters. There were no desks or chairs, so nearby farmers moved their dining tables to the school, and students brought their own stools to class each day. Liu Feng said, "Our ancestors have never had a school here. Although the conditions of the school that Teacher Wu established are poor, it is still our own. Our descendants will no longer be like their ancestors, unable to even write their own names. We are deeply grateful to Teacher Wu from the bottom of our hearts." Thus, a very modest primary school was born amidst the high hopes of the villagers of Dazhu Village.

In the autumn of 1984, 26 school-aged children happily entered the school, becoming the first batch of students after its establishment. Among them, the oldest was 14 years old, and the youngest was 6.

The Dowry Turned into a Boat

Dazhu Village is located in an area with "five slopes and four gullies." The villagers all live in the submerged area of the reservoir, with the nearest households being more than a kilometer apart. The only means of transportation in the reservoir area is a small human-powered boat, making travel very inconvenient.

Due to the scattered residences, ensuring that students could attend school on time became a major problem. The school is located in Liujia Gorge in the reservoir area, surrounded by water on three sides and a mountain on one side. To go to school, every morning, the children would stand by the shore with their school bags, waiting for passing boats to take them to school. If they did not encounter a passing boat, the children would have to miss school that day. Many children would stand by the shore for an entire morning, longing for a boat, only to return home dejectedly with their school bags.

To ensure that the children could attend school on time, Wu Guogui decided to build a boat to transport the students. However, building a boat at that time would cost at least 800 yuan, equivalent to the annual income of six full-time laborers in the reservoir area. With no money at home, she went to borrow, but many relatives and friends declined. In desperation, she asked her parents to use the wood earmarked for her dowry to build the boat, promising not to ask for any money from her parents when she got married. Her parents scolded her, "If you go to your husband's home empty-handed, you don't mind, but what about your parents' face?" Her parents did not understand, so Wu Guogui brought in the village head, relatives, and parents of the students to persuade them. Finally, her parents agreed and helped her find the best craftsmen to build a small boat.

From then on, she would row the boat every morning, traveling over 20 miles to pick up students for school, and in the afternoon, she would row them back home, traveling over 50 miles each day. On hot summer days, her clothes would be soaked with sweat. In the cold winter, her hands would freeze like carrots. In the dense fog of late autumn, the lake would be a vast expanse of white, making it impossible to distinguish directions. Wu Guogui could only row the boat while blowing a whistle, and the students waiting on the shore would call out to her, helping her determine where to pick them up. Since 1984, for five years of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, regardless of wind or rain, Wu Guogui never missed a day of transporting the students. Between the green mountains and clear waters, her small boat would continuously ferry the children towards the shore of hope.

The Phoenix That Would Not Fly Away

One day, student Liu Shifen came to say goodbye to Teacher Wu with tears in her eyes because her family could not afford the tuition, and she could no longer attend school. Facing the pure eyes of the children, Wu Guogui made a firm decision: "No matter what, I cannot let them lose the right to an education." From then on, she used her spare time to teach students from families in difficulty at their homes, buying books and notebooks for Liu Shifen with her own money. To reduce the burden on the students' families, Wu Guogui raised long-haired rabbits during her spare time, organized students to plant vegetables and fruit trees, and used the money from selling rabbit fur and vegetables to pay the tuition for students from poor families, ensuring that all students in her class could complete their studies. To improve her teaching level, Wu Guogui used her spare time to participate in correspondence courses for a bachelor's degree, studying courses such as educational science and educational psychology. In her teaching, she also created a teaching method of combining unified and differentiated instruction, teaching students according to their individual needs.

Her hard work paid off. In 1986, during Chongqing's inspection of universal primary education, her school met all the requirements. In 1987, in the county-wide examination, her 54 students achieved an average score of second place and the highest score in mathematics among the eight classes of the same grade. For the sake of these children, Wu Guogui had paid not only her sweat and blood but also her heart. Last year, her fiancé, who had been engaged to her for four years, rushed back from a construction site in Kunming, and both families had prepared a new home and furniture, hoping they could get married soon. Her fiancé kindly advised her, "After getting married, we can fly away together. A helper who boils water and cooks on a construction site can earn over 100 yuan a month, much more than being a private teacher in this poor and remote village, earning a monthly salary of 48 yuan and 50 cents." Wu Guogui sincerely told her lover that she loved him deeply, but after marriage, she would continue to work in Dazhu Village in education. To ensure that Dazhu Village would no longer have new illiterates, she would continue to run this school. Her deep affection for her hometown moved her fiancé, and they postponed their wedding by a year, waiting for this batch of students to graduate before getting married.

In 1986, Wu Guogui joined the Communist Party of China. In 1987, she was elected as a member of the county political consultative conference. Last year, she was selected as an advanced worker in moral education for primary and secondary schools nationwide. This year, she was awarded the title of outstanding youth by the Communist Youth League of Chongqing. Facing the countless honors, Wu Guogui remains the same as before, rowing her boat, carrying a group of children, and spreading laughter and joy along the way.

    摇小船的女教师
    ——记民办乡村小学教师吴国贵
    马平
    在重庆市大足县化龙水库淹没区农户们的心目中，“吴老师”是一个十分亲切美好的名字。
  白手起家办小学
    1983年7月，17岁的吴国贵初中毕业回到故乡——化龙乡大石村，成了全村学历最高的“金凤凰”。
    大石村地处化龙水库的淹没区内，一座303米长的拦水大坝将它与外界隔开。大坝外，相距不足10公里外，就是闻名中外的旅游胜地大足宝顶石刻，中外游客如云；而大坝内，却是一派贫困景象，大石村423户农家，全年人均收入不足140元。农户们散居在库区两岸的坡地上，自耕自食，过着“日出而作，日落而息”的生活，全村70％以上的大龄青年打着光棍，因为这里太穷，库区姑娘拚命往外嫁，外边的姑娘不愿意往穷坑里跳。然而，吴国贵没有走。起初，村里安排她担任扫盲班的教师。她望着孩子们的父母坐在教室，而大群的适龄儿童在窗外探头，心想老的文盲刚扫过，新的文盲又长成，这样的扫盲何时了。这一年，村里有11名青年报名参军，谁知统统被刷了下来，一问原委，都是因为没有文化，部队不要。经过深思熟虑，吴国贵向村、乡领导提出要在大石村办一所小学。她的要求很快得到了乡村领导、家乡父老和学生家长的支持。学校没有教室，民兵连长刘峰让出了自己家一间不足14平方米的小房。没有课桌、椅凳，附近几家农民就将自己家吃饭用的方桌搬到学校，学生每天上学自带小凳。刘峰说：“我们这里祖祖辈辈从未有过学校，吴老师办的学校条件虽差，但总是我们自己的。我们的后代再也不会像他们的前辈那样，连自己的名字都不会写，我们从心底里感激吴老师。”就这样，一所十分简陋的小学在大石村乡亲们的厚望中诞生了。
    1984年秋，26名适龄儿童愉快地踏入学校，成为建校后的第一批新生。他们当中，年龄最大的14岁，最小的6岁。
          嫁妆变成了小船
    大石村地跨“五坡四沟”，村民们都居住在水库淹没区内，户与户相距最近的都在一公里以上，库区唯一能代步的工具就是人力小船，交通十分不便。
    由于居住分散，学生能否按时到校上课成了一大难题。学校位于库区的刘家沟，它三面环水，一面靠山。为了上学，每天一早，孩子们就背着书包站在岸边，等待过往的行船，顺路搭送到校。如果遇不见顺路船，孩子们当天就只好缺课。许多孩子在岸边，往往一站就是一个上午，望眼欲穿，最后却只能背着书包怏怏回家。
    为了让孩子们能按时上学，吴国贵下决心自己造一条船接送学生。但造一条船在当时少说也得800多元，这笔钱相当于库区6个全劳力的全年收入。家里没有钱，她就去借，可许多亲友都面带难色地回绝了她。万般无奈，她要求父母将留给她当嫁妆的木料拿来造船，并以将来出嫁再不要家里一分钱为条件。父母责备她：“将来出嫁你空手去婆家，你不在乎，可父母的脸面往哪里放。”父母想不通，吴国贵又去搬来村长、亲友、学生家长，多方耐心劝说，最后父母终于同意了，还帮助她请来最好的工匠造了一条小船。
    从此，她清晨摇着小船行程20余里接学生上学，下午又驾船送学生回家，每天往返50余里。炎热的夏日，她衣服烤出层层白色的汗渍。数九寒冬，她双手冻得像胡萝卜。深秋的水库浓雾弥漫，湖面一片白茫茫，辨不清东南西北，吴国贵只能一边划船，一边吹着哨笛，站在岸边的学生听到笛声后便大声呼叫，她就这样来判定学生在什么地方候船。从1984年开始，5个春夏秋冬，无论是刮风下雨，吴国贵从未间断过接送学生。在绿水青山之间，她那咿咿呀呀的小船不停地把孩子们摇向希望的彼岸。
            飞不走的金凤凰
    一天，学生刘世芬眼泪汪汪的来向吴老师道别，因家里无力支付学费，她不能再上学了。面对孩子们一双双纯真的眼睛，吴国贵暗下决心：“说什么也不能让他们再失去上学的权利。”从此，她利用课余时间为家里有困难的学生送课上门，自己掏钱给刘世芬买了书和作业本。为了减轻学生家长的负担，吴国贵课余喂养长毛兔，组织学生种蔬菜，种果树，用卖兔毛和蔬菜水果的钱为家庭困难的学生支付学费，保证全班学生都能完成学业。为了提高教学水平，吴国贵利用业余时间参加大专函授学习，自学了教育学、教育心理学等专业课程。在教学中，她还根据学生年龄参差不齐的实际情况，创造了一套统分结合、因人施教的教学方法。
    功夫不负有心人。1986年，重庆市普及小学教育检查时，她的学校完全符合要求。1987年，在全县统考中，她的54名学生在参加统考的同年级8个班中获得平均成绩第2名、数学单科成绩第一名的好成绩。为了这一群孩子，吴国贵付出的不仅仅是心血和汗水。去年，已同她订婚4年的未婚夫专程从昆明某建筑工地赶回，两家老人也把新房家具备齐了，希望他们能早日成婚。未婚夫好心劝她，结了婚他们可以一道远走高飞，在工地上一个烧开水做饭的帮工每月都能拿100多元，比在这穷乡僻壤、起早摸黑当民办教师月薪48元5角强得多。吴国贵也真诚地告诉恋人，她对他情深意重，但婚后她将继续留在大石村从事教育工作。为让大石村从此不再有新的文盲，她要把这所学校办下去。她对家乡这片土地深深的眷恋，使未婚夫深受感动，他们把婚期推迟了一年，等这期学生毕业后再结婚。
    1986年，吴国贵加入了中国共产党。1987年，她被选为县政协委员。去年她当选为全国中、小学德育先进工作者。今年她又被共青团重庆市委授予杰出青年的称号。面对纷至沓来的荣誉，吴国贵仍同往日一样，摇着她的小船，载着一群孩子，洒下一路欢声笑语。
