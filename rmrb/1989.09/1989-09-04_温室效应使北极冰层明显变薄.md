    The Greenhouse Effect Causes Significant Thinning of Arctic Ice

    Xinhua News Agency, London, September 3

    British scientists have discovered that the Arctic ice layer has significantly thinned over the past decade. They believe this may be a sign of global warming caused by the greenhouse effect.

    Dr. Peter Wadhams, director of the renowned Scottish Polar Research Institute and an authority in ice physics, recently announced that British nuclear submarines measured the ice thickness in the region north of Greenland using sonar. They found that the average ice thickness had decreased from six to seven meters in 1976 to four to five meters in 1987, a reduction of about 30 percent.

    Dr. Wadhams said that the melting of the five million square kilometers of Arctic ice could further accelerate the process of global warming.

    温室效应使北极冰层明显变薄
    新华社伦敦九月三日电　英国科学家发现，北极冰层十年来明显变薄。他们认为，这可能是温室效应引起地球气候变暖的迹象。
    世界著名的冰物理学权威、苏格兰极地研究所所长彼得·瓦德哈姆斯博士最近宣布，英国核潜艇在格林兰以北地区的冰层下用声纳测量冰层厚度，发现冰层平均厚度已从一九七六年的六—七米减少到一九八七年的四—五米，即减少百分之三十。
    瓦德哈姆斯博士说，面积五百万平方公里的北极冰层的融化，可能会进一步加速气候变暖的过程。
