Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, the ancient land of China experienced an unprecedented storm. The storm revealed the true mettle of China's intellectuals. The waves of the storm washed away the chaff, leaving the pure and the impure to reveal themselves. Among the intellectuals, a few turned out to be scoundrels, but the vast majority, who took it upon themselves to revitalize the country, once again showed the world their innocent hearts and their ardent desire to serve the country.

Wang Yinglai, Liu Chengxian, and Li Ruiyang, three scientists from Shanghai representing the old, middle-aged, and young generations, are among the thousands and thousands of intellectuals who have returned to China after completing their studies abroad.

Li Ruiyang—

"At a time when the country needs people, how can I not return?"

Montreal, Canada. On May 29, 1989, 32-year-old Chinese doctoral student Li Ruiyang was eager to return home. In December 1987, Li Ruiyang, who had excelled in his studies, was selected from a village in Hunan's Taoyuan to study for a doctoral degree at Shanghai University of Mechanical Engineering. According to an agreement between the university and Concordia University in Canada, he was sent to the mechanical engineering department of Concordia University to continue his studies, with the Canadian side providing a scholarship to complete his doctoral thesis. Li Ruiyang was diligent in his studies and had shown strong research capabilities even during his master's degree at the university of mechanical engineering. After entering Concordia University, the superior working conditions and rich academic atmosphere further enhanced his abilities.

Li Ruiyang quickly made a name for himself. His research topic, "The study of the metastable flow of refrigerants through capillaries," is a new and emerging field that involves knowledge from various areas such as optimization theory in mathematics, microcomputer processing, and mechanics. Under the guidance of his Canadian supervisor, Professor Lin Yuxi, Li Ruiyang spent a year and a half in intensive research and experimentation, completing five academic papers. These papers, for the first time internationally, proposed a method for fitting the relationship of metastable flow of refrigerants through capillaries, developed a mathematical model applicable to engineering, and provided new insights into the mechanism of two-phase flow. Four of these papers were accepted for publication by the International Journal of Refrigeration, the International Journal of Multiphase Flow, and the American Journal of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. These journals are internationally recognized as authoritative.

Professor Lin Yuxi highly praised the academic achievements of this Chinese doctoral student he supervised. In a letter to Chen Zhihang, a renowned expert in thermal engineering in China and Li Ruiyang's supervisor in China, Professor Lin Yuxi wrote: "Li Ruiyang's thesis has reached a very high standard for a doctoral degree. From his effective work, it can be seen that Mr. Li Ruiyang, as a scholar, has creativity in science, excellent judgment, and the ability to work independently. This person's personal character is very worthy of respect and trust."

The professor's letter was essentially a "graduation certificate" for Li Ruiyang to return to China. Li Ruiyang happily packed his bags, preparing to return home. He was excited about the prospect of using his knowledge to serve his country, but at this time, his country was experiencing unrest. People tried to dissuade him from returning, but he was determined. He said, "The country spent so much money to nurture me from a village boy into a doctoral student. It's not easy. Now the country is in need of people, how can I not return!" He politely declined the offer to stay and continue working for a while: "The research conditions in Canada are certainly superior to those in China, but my career is in China."

Li Ruiyang finally boarded the plane back to his homeland. He brought with him a heavy box weighing 32 kilograms, filled with the latest foreign books and journals related to his field, purchased with money he had saved. For this, except for leaving a suit and a wool sweater, he discarded all other living items and clothes.

On August 21, after being back in the country for more than two months, Li Ruiyang successfully passed his thesis defense and was awarded a doctoral degree. He was assigned to the Department of Thermal Engineering at Shanghai University of Mechanical Engineering to engage in teaching and research. He said, "I am an intellectual nurtured by my country, and I will not let my country down."

Liu Chengxian—

"I believe in my country, and I want to use my knowledge to serve it."

For Liu Chengxian, a 52-year-old associate researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the return to China on July 12, 1989, was quite unusual!

Three days earlier, Liu Chengxian concluded his nine-month scientific research work at the University of Marburg in West Germany. This was a basic research project funded by the university and led by Liu Chengxian, aiming to uncover the secrets of a heat-unstable and manganese-dependent urease enzyme. This enzyme was discovered by Liu Chengxian for the first time in the world in 1986.

On July 9, on the day he completed his research, Liu Chengxian formally requested to return to China. This was just after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, and international public opinion was in an uproar. The first to dissuade Liu Chengxian was Professor Theim, the plant physiologist at Marburg University who had invited him to work in West Germany. He showed Liu Chengxian a document issued in the name of the governments of various states in the Federal Republic of Germany, instructing every German supervisor of Chinese students to not refuse if a Chinese student requested to stay. Professor Theim said, "You shouldn't rush to return to China now."

On July 10, the academic secretary of Marburg University hosted a family dinner for Liu Chengxian, repeatedly persuading him during the meal: "Would you please consider staying? We really need you here."

On July 11, a German doctoral student who had been working with Liu Chengxian gave him advice filled with concern: "You'd better watch the development of the domestic situation before making a decision. It's too dangerous to go back now."

Liu Chengxian did not doubt the good intentions of his German colleagues. But he said, "I believe in my country. I will not be in any danger if I return." Due to his insistence, on July 12, Marburg University provided him with a ticket to fly to Hong Kong.

This was Liu Chengxian's second return from West Germany. In 1985, he completed his five-year study in West Germany with an outstanding thesis on the relationship between photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation under controlled ecological conditions, earning a "Doctor of Natural Sciences" degree jointly awarded by the University of Bonn and the Technical University of Berlin. Reducing the harmful nitrate content in spinach for human health was a long-term research focus of German scientists. During his studies, Liu Chengxian successfully converted the nitrates in spinach into proteins using methods to enhance photosynthesis and hormone treatment. The world-renowned plant physiologist, Professor Lenz, Liu Chengxian's German supervisor, highly praised this achievement and invited him to stay in West Germany to continue this meaningful and promising research. Liu Chengxian declined, saying, "I went abroad to study to serve my country. Now it's time for me to return to my country and use my knowledge to serve it."

After returning to China, Liu Chengxian devoted himself to the research on "The relationship between the photosynthetic products and nitrogen-fixing activity of leguminous plants." A year later, he discovered a new enzyme in broad beans—a heat-unstable and manganese-dependent urease enzyme. This was the first time a new type of enzyme had been discovered by Chinese scientists since the founding of New China. He applied to the state for funding with great excitement, hoping to gradually uncover the secrets of this enzyme through further research. He received 17,000 yuan. Of course, this was only a drop in the bucket for his research plan, but he fully understood the country's difficulties. Last October, he accepted Professor Theim's invitation to go to West Germany for this research. By this July, he had not only successfully completed the first phase of the work but also found a new method to purify soybean urease enzyme and discovered that soybean urease enzyme has at least three isoenzymes. This was also a first in the world.

On July 14, Liu Chengxian returned to Shanghai for the second time. A new research project—"Space Life Science and Future Agriculture Research"—was waiting for him. This is part of China's space research development plan, with the ultimate goal of constructing a controlled ecological life support system in the outer space of the Earth, creating a cyclical life combination through various biological combinations. This is undoubtedly a very challenging research project, but Liu Chengxian was immersed in a great sense of responsibility. For a scientist who aspires to serve the country, nothing is more exciting than the trust and mission from the country. He faced the difficulties head-on, starting from "The impact of simulated low gravity on plant growth," embarking on a long journey. People found that in the more than a month since Liu Chengxian returned to China, the lights in his laboratory were not extinguished until 11 PM every night.

Liu Chengxian's surname is "Liu," but his colleagues at the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology prefer to call him "Old Ox." An ox eats grass and produces milk. Liu Chengxian said, "I am willing to be such an ox for life."

Wang Yinglai—

"Scientific prosperity brings prosperity to the country, which is my lifelong wish."

Wang Yinglai is 83 years old. Since returning to China in 1945, he has been dedicated to the cause of biochemical research for over 40 years and is still working diligently. He said, "Scientific prosperity brings prosperity to the country, which is my lifelong wish."

In 1938, Wang Yinglai traveled across the ocean to study in the United Kingdom, pursuing a doctoral degree in biochemistry. He went with a strong desire to save the country through science, constantly weaving dreams of national strength in his heart. In 1941, he completed all his studies with excellent grades but was forced to stay abroad due to the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident. When the news of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan arrived, Wang Yinglai was sleepless with joy, immediately packed his bags, and traveled for more than two months to return to his war-torn homeland. However, at that time, he could not engage in any meaningful scientific research. He felt that he had a heart full of passion but nowhere to use it.

History finally provided Wang Yinglai with the opportunity to serve his country. In 1950, in the second year after the founding of New China, after a short period of preparation, he and two other scientists, Feng Debei and Wang You, established the Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, serving as the deputy director of the institute. He also wrote letters to encourage overseas students studying in the UK and the US, such as Zhou Chenglu, Cao Tianqin, and Wang Debao, to return to China, and in 1958, established the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

On February 10, 1988, at the 20th International Symposium on Biotechnology held in Miami, USA, Wang Yinglai was awarded the "Special Achievement Award." This was not only a high honor but also a fitting evaluation of Wang Yinglai's 40 years of dedication to biochemistry research. The conference also awarded him a plaque, which read: "Wang Yinglai served as the leader of the cooperative group from 1958 to 1984 at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. During this period, he led the completion of two outstanding and pioneering achievements. One was the artificial synthesis of insulin in 1965, and the other was the artificial synthesis of yeast tRNA in 1981." On the evening of February 11, the Chinese community in Miami joyfully held a grand banquet for Wang Yinglai, who had received the honor. A specially made cake read: "Light of China."

Wang Yinglai saw his country becoming stronger day by day, and his heart was filled with boundless joy. He had experienced the contrast between old and new China and knew that today's achievements were hard-won, so he was deeply concerned about the unrest and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in late April. He strongly condemned Fang Lizhi and others for their conspiracies and plots to create unrest, saying, "True intellectuals should honestly engage in academic pursuits and serve the country with their knowledge. Fang Lizhi and others, however, are eager to promote bourgeois liberalization and even attempt to overthrow the People's Republic, which is intolerable. They have tarnished the reputation of intellectuals and are the dregs of the Chinese intellectual community." He supported the party and government's decisive measures to suppress the unrest and counter-revolutionary riots, hoping that the country would achieve long-term stability and prosperity.

"An old ox knows that the sunset is short, and it does not need a whip to gallop." As early as 1984, when he resigned from the position of director, which he had held for 26 years, Wang Yinglai devoted himself to the research on "The interaction between enzymes and nucleic acids" and took on the role of the group leader for this research. This is a major basic theoretical research project. The research work previously conducted by the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, including the artificial synthesis of insulin and RNA, mainly focused on the study of biological macromolecules themselves. However, whether it is the existence of life or biological inheritance, it cannot do without the interaction between biological macromolecules. Obviously, to reveal the secrets of life, one must solve the mystery of the interaction between biological macromolecules. Wang Yinglai, at the age of 78, took on this heavy burden, inspiring many later researchers. Under his leadership and participation, this research has made continuous progress in recent years, but he may not see the day when this research, which requires the efforts of several generations, will be successfully completed. Wang Yinglai compared himself to a silkworm, which produces silk until it dies. As long as he is alive, he will continue to "spin silk."

    悠悠赤子心　殷殷报国情
　　——记学成归国的上海老、中、青三位科学家
　　新华社记者　张学全　陆国元
    4月下旬以来，古老的华夏大地经历了一场空前的风波。
    疾风知劲草，烈火炼真金。中国的知识分子在这场政治风波中经历了严峻考验。大浪淘沙，清者自清，浊者自浊。知识分子中出了极少数败类，而千千万万以祖国振兴为己任的正直的知识分子，则再一次向世人展露了他们的悠悠赤子之心，殷殷报国之情。
    王应睐、刘承宪、李瑞阳，不同时期学成归国的上海老、中、青三位科学家，就是这千千万万名知识分子中的三位代表。
    李瑞阳——
    “国家用人之际，我怎能不回去”
    加拿大，蒙特利尔机场。1989年5月29日，32岁的中国博士研究生李瑞阳归心似箭。
    1987年12月，以优异成绩从湖南桃源乡村考入上海机械学院攻读博士研究生学位的李瑞阳，根据学院与加拿大康柯第亚大学达成的合作培养博士研究生的协议，被选送到康大机械系继续深造，由加方提供奖学金完成博士论文。李瑞阳学习刻苦，早在机械学院攻读硕士学位期间，就显示出了较强的研究能力。进入康柯第亚大学后，优越的工作条件和浓厚的学术气氛，更使他如虎添翼。
    李瑞阳很快崭露头角。
    他研究的专业课题“制冷剂通过毛细管的亚稳态流的研究”，是一门近几年才发展起来的新兴学科，涉及数学中最优化理论、微机处理、力学等多方面的知识。在加方导师林燧教授的悉心指导下，李瑞阳经过一年半的潜心研究和试验，先后完成了5篇学术论文。这些论文在国际上首次提出了拟合制冷剂通过毛细管的亚稳态流关系式的方法，发展了一个可供工程应用的数学模型，同时对汽液两相流流动机理提出了新的认识。
    其中4篇论文分别被国际制冷学报、国际多相流学报和美国暖通制冷学报接受发表。这些学报都是世界公认的权威性杂志。
    林燧教授高度评价他所指导的这位中国博士生的学业。在给中国著名热能工程专家、李瑞阳的中方导师陈之航教授的信中，林燧教授这样写道：“李瑞阳的论文达到了很标准的博士水平。可以从他有效的工作中看出，李瑞阳先生作为学者已具有科学方面的创造性，很好的判断能力，独立的工作能力，这个人的个人品德是非常值得大家尊重和信任的。”
    教授的信实际上给李瑞阳发放了学成归国的“毕业证书”。
    李瑞阳高高兴兴整理行装，准备回国。他为将要用学到的知识报效祖国而兴奋不已，然而就在这时，祖国发生了令人不安的动乱。劝阻他回国的人络绎不绝，但他归志已决。他说：
  “国家花那么多钱，把我从一个农村娃培养成博士生，多不容易。现在国家正是用人之际，我怎能不回去！”对挽留他留下继续工作一段时间，他也婉言谢绝：“加拿大的研究条件比起国内当然优越得多，但是我的事业在中国。”
    李瑞阳终于登上了飞往祖国的飞机。他带了一只重达32公斤的大箱子，里面装满了用平时积攒的钱购买的与学科有关的国外最新书刊。为此，在整理行装时，除留下一套西服和一件羊毛衫外，他扔掉了其它所有的生活用品和衣服。
    8月21日，回国两个多月的李瑞阳顺利通过了论文答辩，被授予博士学位。他被分配到上海机械学院动力系热能工程教研室，从事教学和科研工作。他说：“我是祖国培养出来的知识分子，我将无愧于我的祖国。”
    刘承宪——
    “我相信祖国，我要用我的知识报国”
    对于中国科学院上海植物生理研究所52岁的副研究员刘承宪来说，1989年7月12日的归国之行是多么不寻常啊！
    三天前，刘承宪结束了在联邦德国雾伯塔大学为期9个月的科学研究工作。这是一项由校方提供经费而由刘承宪主持的基础研究，旨在揭示一种热不稳定和锰离子依赖型尿囊素酶的奥秘。这种酶是刘承宪1986年在世界上首次发现的。
    7月9日，在结束研究工作的当天，刘承宪正式提出要求回国。这正是北京平息反革命暴乱后不久，国外舆论一片沸沸扬扬之时，邀请刘承宪到西德工作的雾伯塔大学植物生理学家泰姆教授首先出面劝阻。他给刘承宪看一份以联邦德国各州政府的名义下发的文件，文件指示每一个指导中国留学生的西德导师，在中国留学生要求留下时都不得拒绝。泰姆教授说：“你现在不要急于回国。”
    7月10日，雾伯塔大学学术秘书设家庭小宴宴请刘承宪，席间对刘承宪再三挽留：“你是否再考虑考虑，这里很需要你。”
    7月11日，和刘承宪一起工作的一位西德博士，对刘承宪的劝告充满关切之情：“你最好看看国内形势的发展再作决定，现在回去太危险。”
    刘承宪并不怀疑西德同行的善意。但是他说：“我相信我的祖国。我回去不会有任何危险。”由于他的一再坚持，7月12日，雾伯塔大学为他提供了飞往香港的机票。
    刘承宪这是第二次从西德回国。1985年，他以一篇阐述受控生态条件下光合作用与固氮作用关系的出色论文，结束了在西德为期5年的留学生活，获得了波恩大学和柏林工业大学共同授予的“自然科学博士”学位。降低菠菜中危害人体健康的硝酸盐的含量，是西德科学家致力已久的一项研究。刘承宪在留学期间，用提高光合作用和激素处理的方法，成功地将菠菜中所含的硝酸盐转化为蛋白质。世界著名植物生理学家、刘承宪的西德导师伦茨教授对此备加赞赏，邀请他留在西德继续从事这项极有意义而又极有希望的研究。刘承宪谢绝了。他说：“我是为报效祖国而出国留学的。现在是我回国用知识报国的时候了。”
    刘承宪回国后，致力于研究“豆科植物光合作用产物和固氮活性的关系”。一年之后，他在蚕豆中发现了一种前所未见的酶——热不稳定和锰离子依赖型尿囊素酶。这是新中国成立40年来中国科学家第一次发现新种酶。他以极其兴奋的心情向国家申请经费，企盼通过进一步的研究逐步揭开这种酶的奥秘，他得到1.7万元。当然，这对于他的研究计划来说，只是杯水车薪，但他完全体谅国家的难处。去年10月，他接受泰姆教授的邀请，赴西德从事这一研究。至今年7月，不但顺利完成了第一阶段的工作，而且在研究中又找到一种提纯大豆尿囊素酶的新方法，同时发现大豆尿囊素酶至少有三种同功酶。这在世界上也是首次发现。
    7月14日，刘承宪第二次回到上海。一个新的科研项目——“空间生命科学与未来农业研究”正在等待着他。这是中国发展空间研究计划的一部分，其终极目标是要在地球外围空间构筑一个受控的生态生命支持系统，通过各种不同种的生物组合，造成一种循环往复的生命组合。这无疑是一项极其艰难的研究，但是刘承宪却沉浸在一种巨大的责任感之中。对于一个志在报国的科学家来说，没有什么比祖国的信赖和重托更令人激动的了。他知难而进，从“模拟低重力对植物生长的影响”开始，踏上了漫长的征程。人们发现，在刘承宪回国后的一个多月里，他的实验室里的灯光，每晚到11时才熄灭。
    刘承宪姓“刘”，但是上海植生所的同事们更愿意叫他
  “老牛”。牛吃的是草，挤出来的是奶。刘承宪说：“我愿意一辈子做这样的牛。”
    王应睐——
    “科学昌盛祖国昌盛，是我毕生的心愿”
    王应睐今年83岁，从1945年学成归国至今，他已经为祖国的生化科学研究事业奋斗了40多年，现在仍在兢兢业业奋斗不息。他说：“科学昌盛，祖国昌盛，是我毕生的心愿。”
    1938年，王应睐远涉重洋到英国求学，攻读生物化学博士学位。他怀着科学救国的强烈愿望而去，天天在内心深处编织着强国之梦。1941年，他以优异成绩完成了全部学业，却因珍珠港事件爆发而不得不滞留异国他乡。抗日战争胜利的喜讯传来，王应睐夜不成寐，立即打点行装，辗转两个多月，回到了灾难深重的祖国。然而在那时，他根本不可能开展任何意义上的科学研究。他感到自己空有一腔热血。
    历史终于为王应睐提供了报效祖国的机会。1950年，在新中国成立后的第二年，经过短暂的筹备，他和另两位科学家冯德培、汪猷一起，创建了上海生理生化研究所，他担任研究所副所长。他又写信动员正在英国和美国求学的邹承鲁、曹天钦、王德宝等海外学子回国，并于1958年创建了中国科学院上海生物化学研究所。
    1988年2月10日，在美国迈阿密举行的第20届生物技术国际学术讨论会，决定授予王应睐“特殊成就奖”。这既是一个崇高的荣誉，也是对王应睐40年献身生化科学研究的恰当评价。大会同时授予他一面奖盾，奖盾上镌刻着：“王应睐从1958年至1984年任中国科学院上海生物化学研究所所长，在此期间他曾作为协作组组长领导完成了两项杰出的、具有开创性的成果。一项是1965年的人工合成胰岛素，另一项是1981年的人工合成酵母丙氨酸转移核糖核酸。”2月11日晚，迈阿密华侨欢天喜地地为获得殊荣的王应睐举行盛大聚餐会，一只特制的蛋糕上写着：“中国之光”。
    王应睐看到自己的祖国一天天强盛起来，内心充满了无限的喜悦。他经历过新旧中国的对比，深知今天的一切来之非易，因而对4月下旬以来发生的动乱和北京发生的反革命暴乱感到深深的忧虑。他对方励之等人搞阴谋、策划动乱深恶痛绝，他说：“真正的知识分子应当老老实实地做学问，以知识报国。方励之等人却热衷于鼓吹资产阶级自由化，甚至发展到妄图颠覆人民共和国，这是绝不能容忍的。他们玷污了知识分子的名声，是中国知识界的败类。”他拥护党和政府为平息动乱和反革命暴乱而采取的果断措施，企望国家从此长治久安。
      “老牛自知夕阳短，不须扬鞭自奋蹄”。早在1984年辞去担任26年之久的所长职务时，王应睐就致力于“酶和核酸的相互作用”研究，并且担任了这一研究的课题组组长。这是一项重大的基础理论研究。上海生化所以往所进行的科研工作，包括人工合成胰岛素和核糖核酸，主要集中在对生物大分子本身的研究方面。而无论是生命的存在，还是生物的遗传，都离不开生物大分子之间的相互作用，显然，要揭示生命的奥秘，必须解开生物大分子之间的相互作用之谜。王应睐以78岁高龄而挑起这副重担，令许多后来者感奋不已。在他的领导和参加下，近几年来，这项研究不断取得进展，但他是很难见到需要几代人的努力才能完成的这项研究的成功之日了。王应睐以春蚕自喻，春蚕至死丝方尽，他一息既存，就要“吐丝”不已。
    北京平息反革命暴乱以后，王应睐的精神更加振奋。他以一个科学家特有的精确，每天上午8时半和下午2时准时走进办公室，上午11时半和下午5时半离开，一天工作6个半小时。他确实感到精力已大不如前，不敢奢望在科学研究上再有大的突破，但他仍渴望着在有生之年为祖国多做些工作。
