Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st.

The most important celebration in the Chinese film industry over the past 40 years—the First China Film Festival—opened today in Beijing.

Vice Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, and Chairman of the China Film Festival Organizing Committee, Chen Haosu, said at the opening ceremony: Chinese film workers will use this film festival to express their deep and fervent blessings to the great Party, the great people, and the great socialist motherland, and to present new achievements in the development of national socialist film culture as a rich gift to the 40th anniversary of the Republic.

The Chinese film industry, which began 40 years ago, has now established an independent and complete film industrial system. It has occupied the domestic film cultural market, providing healthy and uplifting entertainment and aesthetic services to hundreds of billions of viewers annually. It has cultivated a large number of artistic talents, formed a unique and distinctive film art with national characteristics, and begun to take Chinese films to the world.

The festival, which will last for seven days, will showcase nearly 40 films released in the past two years. The historical epic "The Founding Ceremony" and the documentary "Forty Years Ago Today" are the leading works of this festival and were screened at today's opening ceremony.

When director Li Qiankuan and Xiao Guiyun of "The Founding Ceremony" led the main cast members onto the stage, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic applause. The film, which features major political figures of modern China such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chiang Kai-shek, is widely regarded as a significant breakthrough in terms of both ideological and artistic aspects for Chinese films on major historical themes.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Ruihuan, met with the main creators of "The Founding Ceremony." Li Ruihuan pointed out: This film is a success and has caused a significant response after its release. The film industry should summarize some fundamental aspects from the success of this film. Li Ruihuan extended his congratulations to the production team.

Li Tieying, Li Sixian, Hu Qiaomu, as well as Wang Renzhi, Ai Zhisheng, and Zhu Xun, attended the opening ceremony.
