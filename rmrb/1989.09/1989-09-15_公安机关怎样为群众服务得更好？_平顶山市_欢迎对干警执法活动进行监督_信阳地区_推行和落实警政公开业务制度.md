Public security organs in Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, have taken steps to improve their service to the people by welcoming supervision of their law enforcement activities. In Xinyang Region, the implementation of the open police administration system has been promoted and put into practice.

Pingdingshan City Public Security Bureau's Zhou Jinfu and Su Fugen wrote: To place their work under the supervision of the people, Pingdingshan City Public Security Bureau has used various means such as newspaper advertisements, radio broadcasts, posters, and open letters to publicize the procedures and results of their work in various departments. They have set up 187 suggestion boxes in front of public security organs at all levels and in major public places to accept people's supervision at any time. They also hold activities to solicit opinions from the people in their jurisdiction every quarter and have a director's reception day every week to gather opinions. Additionally, they have appointed over 500 provincial, municipal, and district people's representatives, political consultants, workers, and journalists as supervisors in the entire city to supervise the law enforcement activities of the police.

These open measures have played a good role in improving the quality of the police. In the first half of this year, the number of illegal and disciplinary incidents involving police officers in the city decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year. For example, the 10 supervisors appointed by Xishichang Sub-bureau often report social security situations, people's demands, and the work style of the police to the bureau and have come up with many good ideas. In May, a supervisor reported that the residents in his area had difficulty finding personnel to handle household registration at the sub-bureau. In fact, to facilitate the people's household registration, the sub-bureau had installed a service counter in the duty room with photos of all the police officers and their names and positions, and a small pocket below the photos for placing certificates. If the people came to handle business and couldn't find anyone, they could write down what they needed to do and put it in the pocket. The police would check the pocket and handle it in a timely manner, and bring the procedures to the person the next day. However, why did the problem of difficult household registration reappear? Upon investigation, it was mainly because the police officers returned too late and did not insist on checking the pocket every day. The bureau leader immediately convened a meeting and required the police officers in charge of the segments to check the pocket regardless of how busy they were each day. If a police officer had something to do, someone else must take their place.

Zhang Qilun and Wang Zhongshan from Xinyang Region wrote: To facilitate the people's business and supervision, Xinyang Region Public Security Bureau has been promoting the open police administration system for nearly two years.

The open police administration mainly involves publicizing laws, regulations, procedures, time limits, results, and the responsibilities of personnel in various aspects such as household registration management, public security management, entry and exit management, traffic management, fire management, and public security information work.

To effectively ensure the implementation of the open police administration system, Xinyang Region Public Security Bureau has stipulated that leaders at all levels of public security organs must set an example, conduct regular inspections and evaluations, and implement rewards and punishments. At the same time, they actively accept supervision from party committees, people's congresses, supervisory bodies, auditing bodies, and people's procuratorates at all levels. In terms of humbly accepting the supervision of the people and the media, they have also stipulated that they must adhere to the system of leaders receiving people's letters and visits, hold press conferences, and engage in dialogue with various sectors. They appoint some people as special supervisors, regularly report their work to residents, organize people to evaluate the police, and require police officers on duty to wear badges, carry police numbers, and armbands, as well as set up complaint boxes and public supervision hotlines to seriously investigate and deal with police officers who violate laws and disciplines.

　　公安机关怎样为群众服务得更好？
　　平顶山市——欢迎对干警执法活动进行监督
　　信阳地区——推行和落实警政公开业务制度
    河南平顶山市公安局邹金富、苏福根来信：河南平顶山市公安局为了把自己的工作置于群众监督之下，利用登报纸、上广播、出海报、印发公开信等形式，公布了各部门的办事制度和办事结果。他们在各级公安机关门前和主要公共场所设置了187个意见箱，随时接受群众监督。还通过每季度一次的征求辖区群众意见活动，每周一次的局长接待日，征求意见。他们还在全市范围内，聘请了500多名省、市、区人大代表、政协委员、工人、记者等为监督员，对干警执法活动进行监督。
    这些公开化措施，对提高干警素质起了很好的作用。今年上半年，全市干警违法乱纪事件比去年同期下降50％。例如，西市场派出所聘请的10名监督员，经常向所里反映社会治安情况、群众要求、干警作风，并出了不少好主意。今年5月，一监督员反映，他所在地段的群众到派出所报户口找不到办事人员。按说，这个所为方便群众报户口，在值班室装一个板式服务台，贴上全所民警的照片并注上姓名职务，照片下面放一个装证件的小口袋，来所办事的群众万一找不见人，可把要办的事写清楚装进小口袋里，民警检查口袋及时办理，第二天将手续带给本人。可是为什么又出现办户口难呢？经查，主要是民警归来太晚，没有坚持天天开袋。所领导人立即召集会议，要求管段民警不论每天工作多忙，也必须开袋检查，哪个民警有事，必须有人替班。
    河南信阳地区张启伦、汪中山来信：为了方便群众办事，利于群众监督，信阳地区公安处近两年来一直推行警政业务公开制度。
    警政业务公开，主要是从有关法律、规定、办事制度、程序、时限、办事结果及办事人员的职责等方面实行公开。公开的警政业务主要有：户籍管理，治安管理，出入境管理，交通管理，消防管理，公安机关信访工作等方面的内容。
    为有效地保证警政公开制度的落实，信阳地区公安处规定了各级公安机关的领导人要以身作则，定期检查评比，奖惩兑现；同时，主动接受各级党委纪委、人大、监察、审计、人民检察等部门的监督。在虚心接受群众、新闻舆论的监督方面，还规定了坚持领导接待群众来信来访制度，坚持新闻发布会制度和与各界对话制度，聘请一些群众为特约监督员，向居民定期报告工作，组织群众评议干警；干警执勤必须挂牌、佩带警号、臂章，以及设立举报箱和群众监督电话，严肃查处违法乱纪的干警。
