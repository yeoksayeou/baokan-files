Since the publication of "Water Margin," the story involving Wu Dalang, Pan Jinlian, Wu Song, and Ximen Qing has been repeatedly adapted into various forms of stage performances by artists across generations. Kunqu, Peking Opera, Clapper Opera, Han Opera, Cantonese Opera, Yue Opera, Drum Opera, Storytelling, and even films and television—it seems that every possible medium has been used. Why is this the case? Certainly, it is not merely because Pan Jinlian is beautiful and that several people died for her. Later generations listed her alongside Yan Xiejiu, Pan Qiaochun, and Jia Shi, calling them the "Four Great Harlots" of "Water Margin," making her infamous and notorious. More importantly, the romantic entanglements surrounding Pan Jinlian vividly reflect the essence of feudal society at that time, providing rich material for exploration and thought. Therefore, this topic has long been a subject of enduring interest and endless discussion. As someone who has dedicated my life to literary creation and is also an incurable theater enthusiast, I naturally pay special attention to this. After watching the Kunqu opera "Pan Jinlian," adapted by Shanghai Kunqu Troupe's scriptwriter Liu Guangfa and directed by renowned dramatist Yang Shubin, which is set to participate in the second China Art Festival, I felt particularly satisfied.

During the adaptation and direction process, the creators first clarified the positions of the characters: Wu Dalang is the most unfortunate victim of the feudal system; Pan Jinlian is both a victim and, due to her foolishness, weakness, and lack of discernment, a contributor to Wu Dalang's death; Ximen Qing is the direct murderer, but the true culprit behind this tragedy is Zhang Da Hu. As for Wu Song, his rejection of love and killing of his sister-in-law, although influenced to some extent by feudal ideology, is primarily driven by his natural brotherly affection and is therefore beyond reproach.

With such a clear blueprint, the main actors in the play naturally have an easier time shaping the characters; however, since the artistic images of Pan Jinlian and Wu Song have long appeared on stage and have been performed by many predecessors, to some extent, they have already taken shape, and the audience has formed fixed opinions. Breaking through these established forms is quite challenging. Fortunately, Liang Guyin has deep artistic skills and rich stage experience, and the character of Pan Jinlian suits her acting style well. Therefore, she effortlessly created a new image of Pan Jinlian, who is complex and ever-changing, in front of the audience.

In the novel "Water Margin," the image of Wu Song is quite vivid. However, apart from being brave and upright, he differs from characters like Lin Chong, Lu Zhishen, Li Kui, and Shi Xiu in many ways. When dealing with the conflict between his brother and sister-in-law, his inner thoughts must have been different from when he fought the tiger, fought Jiang Gate God, or fell into the black shop run by Zhang Qing and Sun Erniang. After watching Ma Zufu's performance as Wu Song, one cannot help but feel delighted, because he obviously understands the distinctions mentioned above. Therefore, his use of eye expressions, spoken dialogue, and even his gestures are all carefully measured, neither too hot nor too cold, with layers and progression. On one hand, he has absorbed the strengths of predecessors like Zhou Xinfan and Gai Qingtian; on the other hand, he dares to innovate. This is undoubtedly linked to his persistent efforts in his craft, his fearlessness of hard work, and his recent rehearsals under the guidance of masters, continuously performing traditional Kunqu classics like "Grass Edict," "Chaos at Court," and "Sending Jingniang."

    看昆剧《潘金莲》
    秦瘦鸥
    自《水浒传》成书以来，小说中的那一段有关武大郎、潘金莲、武松、西门庆的故事，就不断地被历代的艺术家以各种形式搬上舞台，昆曲、京剧、梆子、汉剧、粤剧、越剧、大鼓、评弹……乃至电影、电视，简直说得上应有尽有。理由何在？当然绝不是仅仅因为潘金莲长得美艳，为了她又死过几个人，后世还把她与阎惜娇、潘巧云、贾氏并列，称为《水浒》四大淫妇，以致臭名昭著，万人侧目；更主要的是由于围绕着潘金莲而产生的那些桃色纠纷，强烈地反映了当时的封建社会的本质，富有探讨思考价值，故而长期以来，一直是人们难以忘却、议论不止的话题。我一生从事文学创作，业余又是一个“不可救药”的戏迷，对此自不免格外关心；而在看过已被确定参加第二届中国艺术节的上海昆剧团编剧刘广发所改编、著名戏剧家杨树彬导演的大型昆剧《潘金莲》后，则尤感惬意。
    在编导创作过程中，首先是把人物的位置都摆正了：武大郎是封建制度下最不幸的受害者；潘金莲则既是受害者，同时又因胡涂软弱、是非不明而促成了武大的死；西门庆是直接的杀人犯，但真正造成这一悲剧的罪魁祸首则是张大户。至于武松，他的拒爱和杀嫂，虽然不免也多少受到了封建意识的影响，但主要从兄弟友爱的天性出发，所以是无可非议的。
    有了这么一张明晰的蓝图，作为本剧的主要演员在塑造人物的形象时，自然要方便得多；但由于潘金莲和武松这两个艺术形象在舞台上出现已久，而且屡经前辈名家搬演，在一定程度上已定了型，观众也都有了成见，再要突破难度很大。幸而梁谷音功力深厚，舞台经验丰富，潘金莲这个人物又恰对她的戏路，因而举重若轻地又在观众面前树立了一个性格复杂多变的新的潘金莲形象。
    在小说《水浒传》里，武松的形象可以说是比较鲜明的，然而除英勇、正直之外，在其他方面，又与林冲、鲁智深、李逵、石秀等人有着许多差异；而在对待自己的兄嫂之间这场纠纷时，其内心活动，肯定又与他打虎、打蒋门神，以及落入张青、孙二娘所开的黑店时截然不同。看了姚祖福所演的武松，人们不能不感到非常欣喜，因为他显然已理解到了上文所说的两种存在着的区别，从而眼神、白口的运用，乃至举手投足之间，处处都能注意掌握分寸，不温不火，有层有次。他一方面既汲取了前辈艺人周信芳、盖叫天等表演艺术中的优点，一方面又敢于创造。这跟他一贯不怕苦，不怕累，执著地钻研业务，近年又在传字辈艺人的指导下，连续排练重演了昆剧传统折子好戏《草诏》、
  《闹朝扑犬》、《送京娘》等所付出的努力，肯定是分不开的。
