The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress hosted a banquet in the Great Hall of the People this evening to welcome the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation led by First Deputy Chairman Lyukyanov.

In his toast, Vice Chairman Peng Chong of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said that the recent high-level talks in Beijing between China and the Soviet Union have brought Sino-Soviet relations onto the track of normalization and marked a new starting point. The relations between the two countries are developing in a stable and healthy direction, and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, culture, and technology is expanding. He said, "China and the Soviet Union are neighbors. We believe that the potential for cooperation between us is great, and the prospects are broad."

Peng Chong pointed out that the visit of the Soviet delegation is not only a development of friendly exchanges between the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Soviet Supreme Soviet, but also a necessary continuation of the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. The visit provides a good opportunity for both sides to exchange information and experiences. He expressed the hope that in the future, exchanges between the two countries' parliaments will be further strengthened.

In discussing the domestic situation, Peng Chong said that since the reforms and opening up, China has undergone profound historical changes in all aspects. Production has greatly increased, the country's economic strength has significantly improved, and the people's living standards have markedly risen. After suppressing the recent counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, China's domestic situation is stable, and the work of reform and opening up is continuing to develop deeply.

He said that the current international situation is undergoing a turning point, with confrontation turning to dialogue and tension turning to relaxation. At the same time, we also see that currently, there are still unstable factors in the world that cause turmoil and tension, and it is necessary for the peoples of all countries to continue to work together to promote the international situation in a direction favorable to peace.

Lyukyanov, in his reply, said that Soviet-Chinese relations should be enduring, friendly, equal, and cooperative.

He said that the exchange of work experience between the power organs of the Soviet Union and China under the conditions of reform should become an important aspect of Soviet-Chinese dialogue. He believes that there is further potential for cooperation between the two countries in the fields of politics, economy, trade, technology, and culture.

The Soviet guests arrived in Beijing this morning by special plane at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Peng Chong and Soviet Ambassador to China Troianovskii welcomed them at the airport.

　　人大常委会欢宴苏最高苏维埃代表团
　　宾主表示要不断加强友好合作
    新华社北京9月12日电 （记者杨国强）全国人大常委会今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，欢迎由最高苏维埃第一副主席卢基扬诺夫率领的苏联最高苏维埃代表团。
    全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲在祝酒辞中说，不久前在北京举行的中苏高级会晤使中苏关系走上了正常化的轨道，开始了新的起点。两国关系正朝着稳定、健康的方向发展，两国之间经济、贸易、文化和科技等领域的合作正在进一步扩大。他说，中苏两国是近邻，“我们相信彼此进行合作的潜力是很大的，前景是宽阔的。”
    彭冲指出，苏联代表团的来访不仅是全国人大常委会和苏联最高苏维埃之间友好交往的发展，而且也是中苏关系正常化发展的必然延续，来访为双方交流情况和经验提供了一次良好的机会。他表示希望今后不断加强两国议会的交往。
    在谈到国内形势时，彭冲说，改革开放以来，中国各个方面发生了深刻的历史性变化，生产有了很大发展，国家经济实力显著增强，人民生活水平有了明显提高。在平息了不久前北京发生的反革命暴乱之后，中国国内局势是稳定的，改革与开放工作正在继续深入地发展。
    他说，当前国际形势正在发生转折性变化，对抗转向对话，紧张转向缓和。但同时我们也看到，目前世界上导致动荡、紧张的不稳定因素依然存在，还需要各国人民继续努力共同推动国际形势朝着有利于和平的方向发展。
    卢基扬诺夫在答辞中说，苏中关系应该是持久、和睦、平等合作和彼此交往的关系。
    他说，苏联和中国权力机构在改革条件下交流工作经验应该成为苏中对话很重要的方面。他认为，两国在政治、经贸、技术、文教等领域的合作有着进一步发展的潜力。
    苏联客人是应全国人大常委会邀请于今天上午乘专机抵京的，彭冲和苏联驻华大使特罗扬诺夫斯基等到机场迎接。
