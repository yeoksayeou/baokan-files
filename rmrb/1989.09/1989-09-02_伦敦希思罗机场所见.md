On the eve of last year's Christmas, a Pan Am aircraft was destroyed by a bomb planted by a terrorist organization in the luggage of a passenger while flying over Scotland. This air disaster resulted in the deaths of all passengers and crew members on board. The British government took the lesson seriously and strengthened airport security checks, doing so meticulously and with great care. In late April of this year, when I returned to China via London, upon entering the customs area of Heathrow Airport, I saw a prominent notice from the British police authorities: "Any unattended luggage will be destroyed upon discovery." It felt a bit like "every blade of grass is a soldier."

Walking into the security check area, passengers' carry-on luggage first undergoes X-ray inspection, then is set aside, and each person's luggage is opened and searched in front of them. Like other passengers, my travel bag was opened, and all my clothes were taken out and piled to one side, each item checked individually; even the few books I carried were flipped through page by page. I am the type of person who hates packing and unpacking luggage, and was already worried about this, but I didn't expect the British officer to carefully put each item back into the bag after the inspection, and even neatly arranged them, apologizing to me as he zipped it up. At that moment, he noticed a pack of Double Happiness brand cigarettes had fallen out, and he insisted on opening the bag to put the cigarettes back. I stopped him, saying, "There's no need. If you like them, you can keep them to try." I saw that he was both happy and hesitant, and called over a colleague from a distance. The other person came over, apparently his superior. He asked the colleague, "This Chinese gentleman gave me a pack of cigarettes. Can I accept it?"

"Of course," the superior replied, nodding to thank me. The officer immediately put the cigarettes in his pocket.

I walked out of the security check area and looked back at the honest young man, who was still diligently carrying out his duties.

    伦敦希思罗机场所见
    其安
    去年圣诞节前夕，在苏格兰上空，一架泛美航空公司客机被恐怖组织事先暗藏在旅客行李中的炸弹炸毁。这起空难致使机上旅客和机组人员全部罹难。英国政府认真吸取教训，加强了机场的安全检查，而且做得一丝不苟，十分认真。今年4月下旬，我经伦敦回国，一进入希思罗机场的海关，就看见英国警察当局醒目的告示：“凡无人照管的行李，一经发现，即予销毁”。真有点“草木皆兵”的味儿。
    走进安全检查口，旅客的随身行李首先经过X线透视检查，然后集中在一旁，当着旅客打开每个人的行李搜查一遍。像其他旅客一样，我的旅行箱打开后，全部衣物被取出来堆在一边，逐一检查；连随身带的几本书也被一页页翻动搜寻。我是最厌烦收拾行李的人，正为此犯愁，没想那位穿制服的英国小伙子在检查完毕后，又把每件物品小心地放回箱内，而且放得整整齐齐，还一边拉上拉锁一边向我表示歉意。这时他发现有一包双喜牌香烟拉下了，又十分认真地要打开箱子把香烟放回去。我拦住他说，用不着了，如果你喜欢就留给你尝尝中国烟吧。我发现他又是高兴又是为难，招呼远处一个同伴。那人应声而至，看来是他的上司。他对来人说：
    “这位中国先生送我一包香烟，我可以接受吗？”
    “当然。”来人回答，并向我点头致谢。小伙子马上把香烟塞进了裤兜。
    我走出安全检查口，回头看那位诚实的小伙子，他又在继续埋头执行任务。
