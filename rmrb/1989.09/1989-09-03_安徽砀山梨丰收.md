The renowned "Pear Capital" of Anhui Province, Dangshan County, is experiencing its best year on record: over 100,000 mu (approximately 6667 hectares) of pears are expected to yield a total of 75 million kilograms, an increase of 5 million kilograms over last year's bumper harvest.

Dangshan pears are famous for their large size and crisp, juicy flesh, earning them a reputation both at home and abroad. Before 1984, the county had only 40,000 mu of pear orchards, with a total yield of less than 40 million kilograms. In recent years, the county government has prioritized the development of fruit production as a key strategy to revitalize the local economy, leading to a significant and continuous increase in both the area of pear cultivation and the overall yield.

    安徽砀山梨丰收
    本报讯　著名的“酥梨之乡”安徽砀山县迎来历史最好年景：10余万亩酥梨总产量可望突破0.75亿公斤，比丰收的去年增产500万公斤。
    砀山酥梨以果实硕大、果肉酥脆饮誉中外。1984年前，全县只有梨园4万多亩，总产不足0.4亿公斤。近几年，县政府把发展水果生产作为振兴全县经济的突破口，使梨树栽培面积和产量连年大幅度增长。
