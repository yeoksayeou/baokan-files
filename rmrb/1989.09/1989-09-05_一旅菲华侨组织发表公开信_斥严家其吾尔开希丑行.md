A group of overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines, known as the "Overseas Chinese Travelers' Association," issued an open letter on August 5th in response to the recent reprehensible actions of Wei Jingsheng, Woer Kaixi, and others abroad. The main content of the letter is as follows:

You claim that "one-fifth of the world's population is currently suffering unprecedented terror and tyranny. This is a disaster for China and a disaster for humanity." Think about it, if it weren't for you shouting slogans of freedom, democracy, and human rights, disregarding the law and engaging in student and citizen movements, which then escalated into riots, how would China have ended up with terror, tyranny, and disaster?

China's reforms and opening up over the past decade have achieved certain successes, earning praise from people of all walks of life both domestically and internationally. You propose that "China should move towards political pluralism (multi-party system) and democratization." Currently, Taiwan has the Taiwan independence advocate Xu Xinliang in exile in the United States, and the Dalai Lama in exile in India. Now, with your democratic front, there are so many parties, each vying for power, dividing the nation. You seek a place for yourselves, disregarding national dignity and national interests, relying only on humiliating your own country, trampling on your own nation, and cursing your own compatriots to curry favor with your masters, seeking rewards. This is the behavior of a complete political beggar! Your actions are treacherous to your ancestors and your country. You are traitors to the nation. Therefore, the members of our association make the following two solemn declarations to you:

First, we are members of the Chinese nation. We oppose your attempts to impose Western-style freedom, democracy, and human rights on China without considering China's historical conditions and actual situation. We advocate for freedom, democracy, and human rights within the principles of national sovereignty and the maintenance of national dignity, combined with China's unique ethical values.

Second, we strongly condemn certain powerful countries that deliberately harbor, buy, support, and incite disgruntled politicians or political dissidents from various countries, regardless of whether they are enemies or friends, and then use them to create chaos in their own countries, ensuring that the world never has peace. The so-called freedom, democracy, and human rights are merely tools used by those powerful countries to deceive and confuse the people.

For your personal gain, you receive support and are used by foreigners to stir up trouble in your homeland, then flee your country and become slaves and lackeys of other nations. If one day, when you look up at the moon and think of your homeland, you will feel that you have betrayed your conscience, sold your soul, and betrayed your people!

    一旅菲华侨组织发表公开信
    斥严家其吾尔开希丑行
    本报讯　由一些旅居菲律宾的华侨组成的“旅菲华侨游子会”针对严家其、吾尔开希等人最近在海外的丑恶言行，于8月5日写了一封致这些人的公开信。信的主要内容如下：
    你们说“世界上1／5的人类正处于空前的恐怖与暴虐之下，这是中国的灾难，也是人类的灾难。”试想，若不是你们只懂口呼：自由、民主、人权，目无法纪搞学运、民运，进而演变为暴乱，中国哪来的恐怖、暴虐、灾难呢？
    中国10年来的改革、对外开放取得一定的成就，得到中外各阶层人士的赞许。你们提出：“中国要走向政治多元化（多党制）、民主化。”现在台湾有台独分子许信良流亡美国，中国大陆有达赖流亡印度，如今加上你们的民主阵线，党派之多，各争势力，分裂国家。你们为自己争一席之地，罔顾国家尊严、民族利益，只靠侮辱自己的国家、糟踏自己的民族、咒骂自己的同胞，向主子献媚、邀功求赏，是十足政治乞丐的表现！你们的行径是背祖忘宗，你们是民族的败类。因此本会同仁向你们提出两点严正声明：
    一、本会同仁是中华民族的一员。我们反对你们不根据中国的历史条件和中国的实际情况，死搬硬套仿效西方的自由、民主、人权。我们要在国家主权独立、维护民族尊严的原则之下，结合我国特有的礼义道德来谈自由、民主、人权。
    二、本会同仁最痛恨某些强国专门收容、收买、支持、煽动各国不分敌友的不得志的政客或持有不同政见的政治贩子，然后利用他们去搞乱自己的国家，使世界永无宁日。所谓自由、民主、人权，只是那些强国用来愚人惑众的手段。
    你们为一己之利，受外人支持、利用，在本土兴风作浪，然后逃离故国，充当他国奴隶走狗。假如将来有一天，当你们举头望明月，低头思故乡时，你们会感到自己违背良心，出卖灵魂，愧对国人！
