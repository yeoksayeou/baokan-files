From Qingliu Sandu, we set off by boat along the Jiulong River, drifting leisurely amidst the rhythmic sounds of the oars. The green mountains on both sides seemed to overlap, like a painting or a poem. In less than an hour, we arrived at the site of the Late Pleistocene human tooth fossil excavation, Dongkou Village, which has caused a sensation in all of Fujian.

Upon landing, we were greeted by a burst of flowers and green trees. Halfway up the mountain, there is a cave entrance. Inside, there is a thick layer of mud and sand, which is the Fox Hole where the ancient human fossils were discovered. The Fox Hole faces south, is 20 meters deep, 5 meters high, and 4 to 6 meters wide. It is about 80 meters above the original riverbed and 30 to 40 meters above the surface of the Ansha Reservoir. Inside the cave, there is a layer of yellow soil from over ten thousand years ago, tightly compacted and containing a wealth of animal fossils. Within this layer, a fossilized lower molar of an ancient human was found and preliminarily identified as the "Qingliu Man."

Entering the Fox Hole, one only needs to walk about 10 meters to stand upright with arms stretched out. The cave is dry and can accommodate a hundred people. A bit higher up, there are two stone beds. About five or six steps away from the stone beds, there is a rock that resembles a fox, crouching with its ears upright and eyes fixed forward, as if it is hunting prey. The discovery of the Qingliu ancient human fossils has pushed back the history of human activity in Fujian to over ten thousand years ago. This fills a significant gap in the archaeological record of the Paleolithic era in Fujian and provides invaluable material evidence for exploring the connection between Fujian's prehistoric culture and the early humans discovered in Taiwan. It also provides scientific evidence and explanations for the theory that ancient humans migrated from Fujian to Taiwan.

　　洞口村　狐狸洞
　　李升宝
    从清流沙芜出发，驾一叶扁舟沿九龙溪漫游，在咿咿呀呀的橹声中，两岸青山迭翠，如画如诗，不到一小时，便到了轰动八闽的更新世晚期人类牙齿化石的发掘地——洞口村。
    登上岸，扑面迎来繁花绿树，来到半山腰一个洞口，里面埋着一层厚厚泥沙，这就是狐狸洞，古人类化石便在这个洞里发现。狐狸洞口朝南，洞深20米、高5米、宽4至6米，高度距离原河床约80米，高出安砂水库水面30—40米。洞内保留有一万多年前的黄土堆积，胶结坚硬紧密，层内蕴含丰富的动物化石，就在这一堆积层中发现了一枚古人类下臼齿化石，经科学初步鉴定暂定为“清流人”。
    俯身进狐狸洞，只需10余米便可展臂伸腰。洞干燥，可容百人。略高处，有两张石床，离石床五六步，有一尊形似狐狸的怪石蹲在那儿，竖长耳朵目视前方，似手在捕捉什么猎物。清流古人类化石的发现，把福建人类活动的历史一下子推到一万年以前。填补了福建旧石器时代考古的悬案和空白，特别是对于探索福建史前文化与台湾已发现的早期人类之间的联系提供了极为珍贵的实物资料，使得远古人类经福建迁徙到台湾的推论找到了科学的实证和解释。
