On August 25, in the small town of Lido in southern Italy, hundreds of people held a memorial service for an ordinary South African refugee. The event was broadcast live on television nationwide.

The refugee was named Giri Aisan Masro. At 29 years old, he had participated in the struggle against racial discrimination in South Africa. In March of the previous year, he moved to Italy. Initially, he was very happy, making many friends in the refugee community and actively learning Italian. What excited him the most was that he could dine with whites in restaurants without any discrimination.

However, Masro's "Italian dream" quickly turned sour. As a political refugee, he could not find legal work and had to do "black work" like most immigrants. Problems began from there. He worked in a tomato plantation near Naples called the "Red Paradise." The work was long, hard, and dirty, but he could earn $30 to $40 a day. Despite frequent harassment, he dared not complain, as revealing his identity would result in immediate deportation.

Southern Italy is a relatively poor region. White workers believe that immigrants are taking their jobs, and racial tensions are high. Last winter, Masro said in a television interview: "I had hoped not to repeat my South African experience in Italy, but things did not go as I wished. I have seen things in Italy that should not have happened." He added: "For me, there is no hope left in Italy. South African blacks will not forget what racism is, and I have seen it here too. I can't take it anymore!"

Soon after, Masro was murdered, and his savings were stolen. Although the motive for his murder has not been confirmed as racism, his death symbolizes the shattered "Italian dream" of many immigrants from third-world countries. His murder was reported on the front page, and people discussed it extensively.

In recent years, the number of foreign immigrants in Italy has increased rapidly. Statistics show that three years ago, there were only 300,000, but now there are 1.3 million, with only 10% having legal status. Every year, more than 50,000 immigrants come from Africa alone. Reports indicate that racist incidents in this southern European country are on the rise: recently in Naples, a group of young people shouted racist slogans and threatened to kill a black man, who was forced to jump from a third-floor window.

Recently, a report by the Italian government indicated that by the end of the century, the number of immigrants in Italy will reach 5 million, accounting for 10% of the total population. Some people recall the 1973 film "Bread and Chocolate," which depicts the experiences of Italians migrating to Switzerland. They lament that they never expected the protagonist's experiences to be repeated in Italy today.

    “意大利梦”的破灭
    8月25日，在意大利南部小镇利得诺，数百人为一个普通的南非难民举行追悼会，电视台向全国作了实况转播。
    这个难民叫吉里·艾山·马斯罗，今年29岁，曾在南非参加过反对种族歧视的斗争。去年3月，他移居意大利。起初，他生活很愉快，在难民社团中交了不少朋友，还积极学习意大利语。最使他兴奋的是，能与白人一起在餐馆里用餐而不受任何歧视。
    然而，马斯罗的“意大利梦”很快就不如人意了。作为政治难民，他无法找到合法的工作，只得像大多数移民一样干“黑工”。问题也就从此开始了。他在那不勒斯附近的一个名叫
  “红色天堂”的西红柿种植园劳动。这里劳动时间长，活又累又脏，不过，一天能挣三四十美元。所以他虽经常受欺凌，却不敢申诉，因为一旦暴露身份，他将被立即押送出境。
    意大利南部是较穷的地区，白人劳动者认为移民在抢他们的饭碗，种族关系十分紧张。去年冬天，马斯罗在接受电视采访时说：“我曾希望不要在意大利重复在南非的遭遇，但事与愿违，我亲眼看到了不该在意大利发生的事情。”他还说：“对我来说，在意大利生活已没有什么希望。南非黑人不会忘记什么叫种族主义，在这里我也看到了，实在受不了！”
    不久，马斯罗被杀害，他的积蓄被抢走。尽管还没有查明凶手的动机是否出于种族主义，但他的死象征着许多来自第三世界国家移民的“意大利梦”的破灭。他被害的消息被报刊登在头版，围绕他的死，人们议论纷纷。
    近年来，意大利的外国移民急剧增加。据统计，3年前才30万，而目前已达130万，其中只有10％的人有合法手续。单是来自非洲的移民每年就有5万之多。据报道，种族主义事件在这个南欧国家有增无减：不久前在那不勒斯，一群青年喊着种族主义的口号，威胁要杀死一个黑人，这个黑人被逼得从三楼窗口跳了下来。
    最近，意大利政府的一份研究报告指出，到本世纪末，意大利的外来移民将增到500万，相当于全国总人口的10％。有的人联想到1973年上演的影片《面包和巧克力》。该片描写的是意大利人当年移居瑞士时的遭遇。他们感叹说，真想不到该片主人公的经历今天在意大利重演。　（世绍　编译）
