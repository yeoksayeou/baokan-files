Newspaper reporter Liu Aicheng reports from Bangkok, September 18: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew arrived in Bangkok today, beginning a two-day visit to Thailand. According to reports, Lee Kuan Yew will discuss the Cambodian issue and other matters with Thai leaders.

Before his visit, Lee Kuan Yew told Thai journalists in an interview that the key to peace in Cambodia lies in a comprehensive solution to the problem. He said that Thailand's proposal to "transform the Indochina battlefield into a marketplace" is a blueprint for bringing peace to Vietnam and Cambodia. However, peace requires a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue. He believes that the Thai government is making its utmost efforts to achieve this goal, but cooperation from the Vietnamese authorities is needed.

When discussing the issue of Vietnamese troop withdrawal, Lee Kuan Yew said that ASEAN does not need to pay attention to Vietnam's supposed troop withdrawal by the end of September, because Vietnam did not agree to a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue at the Paris Conference, and the United Nations did not agree to supervise the withdrawal. In the future, ASEAN will continue to work hard to gain international support for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue.

Newspaper reporter Liu Aicheng reports from Bangkok, September 18: According to Thai military sources, a large number of Vietnamese troops disguised as soldiers of the Heng Samrin regime were sent to Battambang Province in Cambodia last week to prepare for combat with the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces.

The local "Nation" newspaper reported today that Colonel Badi, head of the intelligence section of the Thai Army's Chonburi-Daeng border defense forces, told the newspaper's reporter at the border on the 15th that last week, Vietnam sent a large number of its disguised troops, totaling about 5,000, along with the "Heng Samrin regime forces" to Battambang Province.

　　李光耀访泰讨论柬问题
　　大批伪装成金边部队的越军开往马德望
    本报曼谷9月18日电　记者刘爱成报道：新加坡总理李光耀今天抵达曼谷，开始对泰国进行两天的访问。据报道，李光耀将与泰国领导人讨论柬埔寨等问题。
    出访前，李光耀总理在接受泰国记者采访时强调，柬埔寨的和平首先需要全面解决问题。他说，泰国关于“化印支战场为商场”的提法是一个蓝图，要使越南和柬埔寨走向和平。但是，和平需要柬问题获得全面解决。他认为，泰国政府正以最大的努力来实现这个目标。但是，需要越南当局的合作。
    在谈及越南撤军问题时，李光耀说，他认为东盟没有必要去理会越南所谓的9月底撤军，因为越南在巴黎会议上不同意全面政治解决柬问题，联合国也没有同意去监督撤军。东盟今后将继续努力，争取国际社会对全面解决柬问题的支持。
    本报曼谷9月18日电　记者刘爱成报道：据泰国军方人士揭露，大批穿着韩桑林政权部队军装的越南军队上周被派往柬埔寨马德望省，准备与民柬国民军作战。
    此间《民族报》今天报道说，泰国庄他武里—达叻边防部队情报处长巴迪15日在边境对该报记者说，上星期，越南将其大批化装的部队安排在约5000人的“韩桑林政权部队”之中，被一起派遣到马德望省。
