A friend from West Germany invited me to a lakeside in the woods between Cologne and Bonn. Looking around, the lake was surrounded by dense pine forests, and the water was clear enough to see the fish and pebbles at the bottom. People were swimming, rowing, and fishing, each enjoying their own activities. My friend told me, "This used to be an open-pit brown coal mine. After the coal was mined, the brown coal company turned it into a scenic recreation area."

Both Above and Below the Ground

West Germany is a country lacking in energy resources, so the abundant brown coal reserves are particularly valuable. Using it to generate electricity and heat can reduce dependence on external energy sources. West Germany's total brown coal reserves amount to 56 billion tons, with 55 billion tons concentrated between Cologne, Essen, and Dusseldorf. At the current annual production rate of 1.2 billion tons, it can be mined for several hundred years. This area has loose soil, shallow coal seams, and is very suitable for open-pit mining.

However, this area is also one of the richest agricultural regions in Europe, with soil quality rated at 90 out of 100, favorable climate, and agricultural productivity three to four times higher than other regions. Additionally, it is close to major cities, making it convenient for sales. There are also dense forests. Therefore, a sharp contradiction arises: which piece of meat to choose? The ground or the underground? West Germany's answer is both: first borrow the land to mine, and after mining, return the soil and rebuild the homeland. By the end of 1988, this region's open-pit brown coal mines had used a total of 220,000 hectares of land, of which 140,000 hectares had been reclaimed. There are nearly 6,000 hectares of forest, 6,400 hectares of farmland, 747 hectares of water surface, and the rest is buildings and roads. Nine villages with populations over 1,000 and 29,000 residents have been relocated to new areas.

Strict Legal Regulations

Mr. Wittmann from the North Rhine-Westphalia Environmental Protection Department introduced the "Rhineland Brown Coal Area Planning Law" of April 1950, which is an important legal basis for the restoration of open-pit mines. This law has been amended several times and was incorporated into the North Rhine-Westphalia Planning Law in 1979. Its main principle is to require the Rhineland Brown Coal Company to rebuild agricultural land, forests, and other natural environments at the original site of the open-pit mine.

Before developing a mining area, the brown coal company must make detailed plans regarding the scope of the open-pit mine, the timing of the impact on forests, farmland, villages, new residential areas, and the future landscape. These plans must be submitted to the Rhineland Brown Coal Commission, composed of representatives from various parties, for review.

At the same time, public opinion is widely solicited. After the Brown Coal Commission approves the plan, the Brown Coal Company must also formulate technical implementation plans and submit them to the Mining Bureau for approval. Only after both planning steps are approved can the Brown Coal Company obtain permission to start construction. According to him, due to the detailed nature of the work, the approval process takes four to five years, with the aim of ensuring that nothing is done hastily.

Returning Fertile New Fields to Farmers

On a rainy morning, two officials from the News Department and Forestry Department of the Rhineland Brown Coal Company took me on a field visit and introduced the entire process of creating new fields in detail.

At a site in the southern mining area, I saw two large conveyor belts running slowly, one carrying yellow soil and the other carrying coal. A specially designed open-top train car loaded with yellow soil was about to start moving.

They said that the most important part of creating new land is the top layer of yellow soil. Before mining, this layer of yellow soil is first stripped away and transported to the reclaimed area. Old mines that have been mined are first filled with mine tailings and sand and gravel at the bottom, and the top layer is covered with yellow soil. The main method used is wet covering, which involves mixing yellow soil with water to form a slurry and transporting it through pipelines to the ground that has been prepared with a lower foundation. The advantage is that it is cost-effective and the upper layer of yellow soil can be organically mixed with the lower foundation.

After the new land is formed, it is first allowed to dry for 6 to 8 weeks. Then, alfalfa is planted as soon as possible to loosen the soil. This is done for three years, with fertilization, and the soil fertility is restored to the point where crops can be grown. In the following years, winter wheat is planted in late autumn, and winter barley is planted after the wheat harvest, with the aim of increasing the organic matter content and restoring the necessary nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements in the soil.

After several years, this piece of land is fully mature and can be handed over to the farmers, who can plow and harvest in the same year.

Decades of experience have shown that these artificially created new fields are even better than the old ones. The sugar content of sugar beets on new fields is 1-2% higher than on old fields, exceeding the average requirement of sugar factories. The yield of winter wheat is also higher than on old fields. The company also creates agricultural shelterbelts to reduce wind speed and conserve water and soil, and the selection of tree species and cultivation methods are very meticulous. Of course, this is the result of the efforts of agronomists, soil scientists, forestry experts, universities, and research institutions.

Creating More Forests and Lakes for Cities

Due to the development of the West German economy and social changes, people's demands for environmental protection and leisure activities have increased. Another important aspect of the brown coal company's land rehabilitation is the creation of forests and lakes, providing good places for people to visit on weekends and holidays.

After decades of hard work, the southern region has formed a forest-lake area centered around Liblar Lake, Heiderberg Lake, and Treue Lake. In the summer, up to 25,000 people visit here daily, with a peak of 100,000 people. Additionally, several nature reserves have been specially established to allow plants and animals to thrive. The new forest area already has 255 species of plants, and large fish weighing tens of kilograms have been caught multiple times in the reconstructed lakes.

At the end of the visit, I casually asked the host how many people the company has dedicated to land reclamation work, and the answer was: a total of 400 people.

    挖了地下的　重建地上的
    ——西德煤矿区土地整治见闻
    本报记者　江建国
    一位西德朋友邀我去科隆和波恩之间一处林间湖泊郊游。举目四望，沿湖是密密的杉树林，湖水清澈见底，游鱼细石，历历在目。游泳的，荡桨的，垂钓的，各得其所。朋友对我说：“这里原来是一处露天褐煤矿。煤采完了，褐煤公司把它建成一处风景休养区。”
    地上和地下的都要
    西德是个缺乏能源的国家，因而储量甚大的褐煤就显得特别宝贵，用它发电、取暖，尽可能减少对外部能源的依赖。西德褐煤总储量为560亿吨，有550亿吨集中蕴藏在科隆、西琛、杜塞尔多夫间，按目前年产1.2亿吨计算可以采上几百年。这一带土质疏松，煤层距地表浅，最适宜露天开采。
    然而，恰恰这一带又是欧洲最富庶的农业区之一，土质可打到90分，且风调雨顺，农产品产量高于其他地区三四倍，同时距大城市近，销售方便。此外还有茂密的森林。因此就产生一个尖锐的矛盾——几块肥肉要哪块？要地上的还是地下的？西德的回答是地上地下的都要：先借地开矿，矿开完让土壤还家，重建家园。至1988年底，这一地区露天褐煤矿总计用地2.2万多公顷，其中1.4万多公顷已经复垦完毕，有近6000公顷森林，6400公顷农田，747公顷水面，其他是房屋道路，先后搬走了9个1000人以上的村镇，29000居民迁到新地上居住。
    严格的法律规定
    北威州环保部的维特曼先生介绍说，1950年4月的《莱茵褐煤区规划法》是推动露天矿重整山河的重要法律依据。这个法律经多次修改，1979年纳入北威州规划法。它的主要原则就是规定了莱茵褐煤公司必须在露天矿原址重建农田、森林等自然环境。
    褐煤公司在开发一片矿区之前，要作出有关露天矿范围、何时将波及森林、农田、村庄、新居民点建设、未来景观概貌等详细规划，提交由各方代表组成的莱茵地区褐煤委员会审查。
    与此同时，还广泛征求居民意见。褐煤委员会批准这一规划后，褐煤公司还要制订实施技术方案，报矿山局审批。两步规划都获得通过后，褐煤公司才能获准开工。据他介绍，由于搞得过细，批准过程长达四五年，目的是保证不草率行事。
    还给农民肥沃的新田
    细雨蒙蒙的一天上午，莱茵褐煤公司新闻部和森林处的两位负责人带我实地观察了一番，详细介绍了营造新田的全过程。
    在南矿区一处露天矿，我看到两条大传送带正在缓缓运转，一条专运黄土，一条运煤。一列特制的大型敞口车皮装满黄土正要启动。
    他们说，营造新地最重要的是表层的黄土层，开矿前首先剥离这层黄土，运到复垦的地区。开过的老矿先以矿渣、砂石垫底，最上面便覆盖黄土。主要使用湿法覆盖，即把黄土与水混合，形成泥浆，以管道输到打好下层基础的地上。其好处是费用低，上层黄土与下部基础能有机混合起来。
    新地成形之后，首先用6—8星期让其干燥。然后尽早种植苜蓿，使土壤疏松。这样连种3年，同时施肥，地力已经恢复到可以种庄稼的程度。此后几年，深秋时节种小麦，小麦收获再种冬大麦，目的是增加腐殖质含量，使土地必要的氮、磷、钾诸元素重新增多。
    先后经过五六年，这块地已经完全成熟，就可以移交给农户了，农户当年就可以耕耘收获。
    几十年的经验证明，这种人工营造的新田甚至比老地区还好。新田上的甜菜含糖量比老地高出1—2％，比制糖厂的平均要求还高，冬小麦产量也高出老地。这家公司还营造农田防护林，降低风速、保持水土，选用的树种营造方式都极讲究。当然这里凝聚了农学家、土壤学家、林业专家、大学和科研机关人员的心血。
    让城市多几块森林湖泊
    由于西德经济的发展，社会的变迁，人们对环境保护和业余生活的口味提高了，褐煤公司的土地整治另一个重要侧面是营造森林、湖泊，让人们周末假日有个郊游的好去处。
    经过几十年的辛勤努力，南部已经形成以利布拉尔湖，海德尔山湖，忠诚湖为主的森林——湖泊区。夏季来此游玩的每天达2.5万人，最高时达10万人。此外还专门开辟了七八个自然保护区，让植物动物繁衍。新林区已经拥有255种植物，在再造的湖泊里已经多次捕到重达十几公斤的大鱼。
    访问结束时，我顺便问了一下主人，这家公司有多少人专门从事土地复垦工作，答曰：统统算起来400人。
