In July 1987, Li Hongbin, an employee of the Guangdong Hekang County Yuehai Joint Venture Trading Company, collaborated with Chen Liusheng, an individual entrepreneur from Guilin, Guangxi, and Huang Jianmin, the owner of the Guilin Jinyuan Hotel, to reach an agreement with the Yuxi Cigarette Factory in Yunnan to exchange steel for high-grade cigarettes. However, due to restrictions imposed by the tobacco monopoly regulations, they could not directly obtain the cigarettes from the factory. In September of the same year, they approached the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in Hunan, asking them to represent them in signing a contract with the Yuxi Cigarette Factory to exchange steel for cigarettes. At the same time, the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau also provided them with an account and transferred 1500,000 yuan in cigarette funds. On January 5, 1988, Huang Jianmin and his associates withdrew a batch of cigarettes from the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and were caught selling them illegally in Hengyang.

After the case was exposed, the relevant personnel of the Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau did not take responsibility but instead covered up the incident and deceived their superiors. More than a year has passed, and there is still no resolution to the case. The Hengyang City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, which participated in the speculation and illegal trading, has not been punished but instead received a large fine, and the main responsible person has been promoted by the Hunan Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau.

    内外勾结倒香烟  查处一年无消息
    1987年7月间，广东海康县粤海联营贸易公司业务员李宏斌，伙同广西桂林市个体户陈六生、桂林市金苑饭店店主黄健民，与云南玉溪卷烟厂达成用钢材串换高档卷烟的协议。但是，因受烟草专卖条例的限制，他们无法从卷烟厂直接提货，于同年9月找到湖南衡阳市烟草专卖局，让衡阳市烟草专卖局代表他们与玉溪烟厂签订了钢材串换卷烟的合同。同时，衡阳市烟草专卖局还为他们提供了帐户和中转烟款150多万元。1988年1月5日，黄健民一伙从衡阳市烟草专卖局提取了一批香烟，在衡阳市就地倒卖时被缉拿。
    案发后，衡阳市烟草专卖局有关人员不是主动承担责任，而是封锁消息，蒙骗上级。一年多过去了，案子还无下文。参与投机倒把的衡阳市烟草专卖局不仅没有受到处罚，反而分得巨额罚金，主要责任者还被湖南省烟草专卖局提拔了。　湖南衡阳市　余　芳
