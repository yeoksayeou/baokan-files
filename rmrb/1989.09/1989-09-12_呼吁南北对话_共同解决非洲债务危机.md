An international seminar on African debt issues, convened by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), was held in Cairo from August 28 to 30. One hundred fifty representatives from African countries and creditor organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) discussed the worsening African debt crisis and sought solutions.

The seminar called for African countries to strengthen economic management and coordinate South-South cooperation to face the challenge of debt burdens. It strongly urged serious and fruitful North-South dialogue and unanimously decided to establish a high-level working group on African debt issues to assist the OAU in preparing for an international conference on African debt.

The total external debt of the African continent has now reached $240 billion, exceeding the capacity of African countries to bear, and has become a prominent issue in African economics. The vicious cycle caused by the expansion of external debt has led to further deterioration of the African economy and widened the North-South gap.

In his address to the seminar, OAU Chairman and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak pointed out that the African debt crisis has four major symptoms: the amount of overdue principal and interest on external debt is increasing, interest rates on external debt are rising, the amount of new loans is decreasing, and the volume of trade exports is decreasing. In summary, African external debt is rising without new loans, while the repayment capacity is gradually weakening.

The economic foundation of Africa is inherently weak, and in recent years, it has been adversely affected by the international environment. First, the prices of primary commodities such as coconut, coffee beans, nickel, palm oil, natural rubber, and copper, which African countries rely on to repay external debt, have generally fallen by 5% to 16%. Second, the import of industrial manufactured goods is increasingly unfavorable to African developing countries. According to statistics, African trade volume has generally declined, with the most severe year, 1986, seeing a drop of 17 percentage points. African countries have had to pay huge amounts of foreign exchange for the import of industrial manufactured goods and food. According to IMF statistics, the trade deficit of African countries in recent years has remained around $22 billion. If the African debt problem is not resolved soon, the amount of debt may double in the coming years, becoming a major problem in the world economy and North-South relations.

African debt countries only ask for a reasonable reduction in the burden through North-South dialogue. Representatives from Egypt and other countries pointed out that negotiations between creditor countries and organizations and debt countries do not conflict with the holding of an international conference on African debt. The OAU strongly calls for the convening of an international conference to resolve the debt problem through North-South dialogue. "The solution to the problem can only be built on the basis of dialogue, cooperation, flexibility, and gradual progress." The former governor of the Central Bank of Kenya even proposed that African countries, Latin American countries, and other debt countries in the Third World should unite as a whole to strengthen the dialogue position of debt countries and jointly demand debt relief. However, Western creditor countries and organizations have only shown some flexibility on some debt issues, but are strongly opposed to holding an international conference to resolve the debt problem.

"Would there be any loss if the creditors and we sit at the same table to jointly study the best way out of the current deadlock?" OAU Chairman Mubarak humorously asked those who opposed the holding of the African debt conference. This remark seems worth considering for Westerners.

### 呼吁南北对话　共同解决非洲债务危机

　　呼吁南北对话
　　共同解决非洲债务危机

    由非洲统一组织召集的非洲债务问题国际研讨会八月二十八日至三十日在开罗召开。来自非洲各国及世界银行、国际货币基金组织等债权组织的一百五十名代表就日益严重的非洲债务危机发表各自见解，寻求合理解决途径。
    研讨会呼吁非洲各国加强经济管理、协调非洲国家之间的南南合作，迎接债务重负的挑战并强烈要求进行认真的、负有成果的南北对话，而且一致决定成立非洲债务问题高级工作组，协助非统组织筹备非洲债务国际会议。
    非洲大陆外债总数目前已达二千四百亿美元，已超出非洲国家的承受力，成为非洲经济面临的突出问题。外债膨胀引起的恶性循环，导致非洲经济进一步恶化，加大了南北差距。
    非统组织主席、埃及总统穆巴拉克在本届研讨会的致词中指出，非洲债务危机日益严重有四大症状，即拖欠外债本息的金额在不断增加，外债利率上升，新贷款数额下降，贸易出口数减少。概括起来说，非洲的外债在没有增加新贷款的情况下爬升，而偿还能力却日渐衰弱。
    非洲经济基础本来薄弱，近年来又受国际环境的不利影响。一是世界原材料初级产品价格跌落。据国际货币基金组织最近统计，非洲国家赖以偿还外债的传统出口商品，诸如椰子、咖啡豆、镍、棕榈油、天然橡胶及铜等，价格普遍下降百分之五至百分之十六。二是工业制成品的进口越来越不利于非洲发展中国家。据统计，非洲贸易额普遍下降，最严重的一九八六年跌落十七个百分点。非洲国家不得不为工业制成品及食品进口付出巨额外汇。据国际货币基金会统计，非洲国家近年来的贸易逆差始终保持在二百二十亿美元左右。非洲债务问题如不尽早解决，欠债金额有可能在未来若干年内成倍增长，变成世界经济和南北关系中的大难题。
    非洲债务国只要求南北对话合理减轻负担。埃及等国代表指出，债权国和组织同债务国单独谈判，与召开非洲债务国际会议并不矛盾。非统组织强烈呼吁召开国际会议，通过南北对话达成解决债务问题的总原则。“问题的解决只能建立在对话、合作、灵活和渐进的基础上。”肯尼亚中央银行前总裁甚至提议，非洲国家与拉丁美洲国家、第三世界其它债务国联合起来作为一个整体加强债务国的对话立场，共同要求减轻债务。然而，西方债权国和组织只在部分债务问题上有所松动，却极力阻挠举行国际会议、解决债务问题。
    “债权人和我们坐到一张桌子前，大家共同来研究走出目前死胡同的最佳途径，这会有什么损失？”非统组织现任主席穆巴拉克风趣地询问那些反对召开非洲债务会议的代表。这番话看来很值得西方人士考虑。
