Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly advocated for the principle of "two hands," requiring that we focus on one hand on economic development and reform and opening up, and on the other hand on ideological and political work, as well as on severely cracking down on economic crimes and combating corruption. In other words, while we are focusing on the material civilization of socialism, we must also focus on the spiritual civilization of socialism. We must not neglect one for the other, nor can we be strong in one hand and weak in the other. From our practice, we have come to understand that whether or not we adhere to the principle of "two hands" is crucial to the success or failure of the socialist cause, and thus it is a very important guiding principle that we must adhere to for a long time.

The principle of "two hands" is a necessary requirement of the Party's basic line of "one center and two basic points." Throughout the entire primary stage of socialism, we must focus on economic development as the center, ensuring that we both uphold the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state and walk the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country. This is the basic guarantee for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The facts have shown that implementing the Party's basic line, especially combining the two basic points organically in practice, requires constant attention to overcoming two tendencies. One is to use the development of the commodity economy and the promotion of reform and opening up as an opportunity to deny the Party's leadership and the socialist system, to engage in bourgeois liberalization, or to use power for personal gain, engage in power-for-money exchanges, accept bribes, and foster serious corruption. The other is to blame bourgeois liberalization and corruption on reform and opening up, leading to doubts and wavering in the implementation of reform and opening up. If these two tendencies are not overcome, the Party's basic line cannot be fully implemented, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses cannot be fully mobilized, and various contradictions within the Party and society cannot be resolved, and may even be exacerbated, leading the socialist modernization drive astray. The most effective measure to overcome these two tendencies is to adhere to the principle of "two hands."

In actual work, how do we implement the principle of "two hands"? From the perspective of Hebei, first of all, we must correct the guiding ideology of leaders at all levels. Experience has shown that after the Party's work focus shifted to socialist modernization, some comrades often tend to focus solely on economic work while neglecting spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political work. In response to this problem, we have repeatedly pointed out the one-sidedness and harmfulness of this view and approach in relevant meetings and cadre training sessions, emphasizing that the relationship between the two civilizations must be understood and grasped in a comprehensive and dialectical manner. They should not be separated, let alone opposed to each other. They are like the two wheels of a cart and the two wings of a bird, complementing each other and progressing together. This is a reflection and requirement of the essence of socialism. With the correct guiding ideology, work can overcome one-sidedness and achieve good results.

Secondly, when deploying, inspecting, and summarizing work, we must pay attention to embodying the principle of "two hands." In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee has proposed clear tasks and measures for the two civilizations, emphasizing the importance of focusing on various economic tasks while also deploying, in a targeted manner across the province, tasks such as cadre theoretical study, rectifying bureaucratic styles, strengthening Party building, promoting civilized unit construction, and advocating for integrity and combating corruption. With decisions and deployments in place, we also pay constant attention to inspection, summary, tracking, and feedback. Although our deployments and plans are relatively systematic and comprehensive, due to various subjective and objective factors, certain biases may arise during implementation. Paying attention to discovering problems in the work, taking timely measures to solve them, is an important link in implementing the principle of "two hands." Ignoring the biases that have already emerged, or hesitating and failing to come up with countermeasures, may lead to bigger problems.

Thirdly, relying on necessary institutional constraints on leadership behavior, we can overcome the arbitrariness in work guidance. We have fully implemented the target management responsibility system in Party and government organs, evaluating both material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction; evaluating both integrity and performance. To turn the "soft" task of spiritual civilization construction into a "hard" indicator, many Party committees and governments have made the tasks of Party building, civilized unit construction, and social order, like material civilization construction, strive to be quantified, and conduct inspections and evaluations based on this. This prompts leaders at all levels to consciously focus on both civilizations and achieve both results.

Adhering to the principle of "two hands" does not mean that we do not have a focus, or that we evenly distribute our efforts to all work. For Party committees at all levels, in terms of economic work, the main focus should be on the implementation of major policies and guidelines of the Party and the state, research and determination of economic development strategies, economic system reform, and long-term planning, as well as solving major problems in economic development. As for daily economic activities, they should be handled by the government. Party committees should devote more energy to Party building and ideological and political work. Currently, the urgent task is to focus on the struggle against bourgeois liberalization and the fight against corruption, two important aspects, and vigorously promote Party building. To this end, since this year, we have first focused on the anti-corruption construction of provincial departments, and at the same time, we have vigorously promoted the experience of anti-corruption construction in Xingtai region and the implementation of "two public and one supervision" in Baicheng county, that is, publicizing the procedure of handling affairs, publicizing the results of handling affairs, and mobilizing the masses to supervise. We have also investigated and dealt with a large number of major cases. Many corrupt behaviors have begun to be punished. We have also decided to hold a study class for county, city, and provincial committee secretaries in the near future to deeply study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches on "Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization" and related important speeches. We will review and summarize practical experience, and study how to deepen the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. We have come to realize that in the work of Party committees, both adhering to the principle of "two hands" and focusing on key areas, we can, according to the requirements of the situation, lead by example, and continuously push the two civilizations of socialism forward.

### 坚持“两手抓”

    坚持“两手抓”
    中共河北省委书记　邢崇智
    党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志多次提出坚持“两手抓”的方针，要求一手抓经济建设、改革开放，一手抓思想政治工作和严厉打击经济犯罪、惩治腐败。也就是说，在抓紧社会主义物质文明建设的同时，必须抓紧社会主义精神文明建设，决不能顾此失彼，也不能一手硬，一手软。我们从实践中体会到，是否坚持“两手抓”，关系到社会主义事业的兴衰和成败，因此是一个必须长期遵循的极其重要的指导方针。
  坚持“两手抓”的方针，是党的基本路线“一个中心、两个基本点”的必然要求。在整个社会主义初级阶段，紧紧围绕经济建设这个中心，做到既坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本，又走好改革开放这个强国之路，这是建设有中国特色的社会主义的基本保证。事实说明，贯彻党的基本路线，特别是将两个基本点在实践中有机地结合起来，需要经常注意克服两种倾向。一种是借发展商品经济、推进改革开放之机，否定党的领导和社会主义制度，搞资产阶级自由化，或以权谋私，权钱交易，贪污受贿，滋生严重的腐败行为；另一种是把资产阶级自由化和腐败行为归咎于改革开放，对改革开放产生怀疑和动摇。不克服这两种倾向，党的基本路线就不能全面贯彻，群众中蕴藏的社会主义积极性就不能很好发挥，党内和社会上的各种矛盾就不能得到解决，甚至还可能激化，社会主义现代化建设就会走入歧途。而克服这两种倾向的一个最有效的措施，就是要坚持“两手抓”的方针。
    在实际工作中，如何贯彻好“两手抓”的方针呢？从河北情况来看，首先，要端正各级领导的指导思想。经验表明，党的工作重点转移到社会主义现代化建设上来后，一些同志往往容易产生单纯抓经济工作与忽视精神文明建设、忽视人的思想政治工作的现象。针对这个问题，我们无论在有关会议上还是在干部培训中，多次指出了这种看法和作法的片面性及其危害性，强调对两个文明建设的关系要全面地、辩证地理解和把握，既不能把它们割裂开来，更不能把它们对立起来，它们如同车之两轮、鸟之两翼，是相辅相成，并行不悖的。这是社会主义本质特征的反映和要求。指导思想对头了，工作上就能克服片面性，收到好的效果。
    其次，在部署、检查、总结工作时，要注意体现“两手抓”的方针。这几年，省委对两个文明建设提出了明确任务和措施，在强调抓好各项经济工作的同时，在全省有针对性地统一部署了干部理论学习、整饬机关作风、加强党的建设、开展文明单位建设活动、倡廉惩腐等项工作。有了决策、部署，还经常注意检查、总结，搞好追踪、反馈。虽然我们做出的部署、制订的计划比较系统全面，但在实施的过程中，由于种种主客观因素的影响，有时会出现某些偏颇。注意发现工作中的问题，及时采取措施加以解决，是贯彻好“两手抓”方针的重要一环。对已出现的偏颇视而不见，或犹豫不决，拿不出对策，就可能酿成大的问题。
    第三，依靠必要的制度约束领导行为，克服工作指导上的随意性。我们在党政机关全面推行目标管理责任制，既考核物质文明建设，又考核精神文明建设；既考廉，又考绩。为了把精神文明建设这个“软”任务变成“硬”指标，不少地方的党委、政府把党的建设、文明单位建设、社会治安等工作任务，同物质文明建设一样，力求做到数据化，并依此进行检查和考核。这样促使各级负责同志自觉地做到两个文明建设一起抓，两个成果一起要。
    坚持“两手抓”的方针，并不是不要重点，对任何工作都平均使用气力。对于各级党委来说，在经济工作方面，主要抓党和国家重大方针政策的贯彻实施，抓经济发展战略、经济体制改革、长远规划的研究确定，以及经济发展中的重大问题的解决，至于日常的经济活动，则由政府去抓。党委要把更多的精力，放在抓好党的建设和思想政治领域的工作上。当前，迫切的任务是要抓住反对资产阶级自由化的斗争和惩治腐败这两个重要环节，大力推进党的建设。为此，今年以来，我们首先抓了省直机关的廉政建设，同时，在全省大力推广了邢台地区抓廉政建设和藁城县实行“两公开一监督”即公开办事制度、公开办事结果、发动群众监督的经验，并查处了一大批大案要案，许多腐败行为开始受到了惩治。我们还决定在最近举办地、市、县委书记参加的读书班，深入学习邓小平同志关于《坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化的论述》和有关重要讲话。回顾总结实践经验，研究如何把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争引向深入的问题。我们体会到，在党委工作中，既坚持“两手抓”，又注意抓重点，才能根据形势发展的要求，因势利导，不断地把社会主义的两个文明建设继续推向前进。
