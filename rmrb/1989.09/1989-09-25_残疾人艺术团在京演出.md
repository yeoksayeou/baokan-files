The China Disabled Persons' Federation organized the China Disabled Artists Troupe, which performed in Beijing tonight. As one of the 60 programs of the Second China Arts Festival, the China Disabled Artists Troupe showcased the unique artistic talents of China's disabled individuals to a wide audience.

The troupe consists of nearly 100 performers, hailing from Beijing, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shandong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang provinces and autonomous regions, as well as various factories, rural areas, and schools. Among them are blind, deaf, and physically disabled individuals, all of whom are key figures in local disabled arts activities.

The performance includes vocal music, instrumental music, dance, sign language poetry, and dance dramas, all of which are award-winning pieces from the national disabled arts competition. The new dance drama "Love for Light," specially arranged for the festival, depicts the disabled individuals' love for life and their yearning for light and beauty. This is the first time a dance drama performed by deaf individuals has been staged in China. This program will be performed for the capital's audience for 5 shows.
