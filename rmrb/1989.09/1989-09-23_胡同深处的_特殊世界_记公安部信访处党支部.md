The "Special World" in the Depths of the Hutong
— A Record of the Public Security Bureau's Letters and Visits Office Party Branch

Reporters: Wú Hào, Yuán Jiàndá

In the depths of Dongtangzi Hutong, No. 49, Dongcheng District, Beijing, lies the Public Security Bureau's Office of Letters and Visits. Though it is tucked away in a narrow alley, many people come seeking it.

Since 1983, the Letters and Visits Office has directly or indirectly participated in the rectification of approximately 80,000 wrongful, false, and erroneous cases, resolving a large number of historical issues. Through letters and visits from the public, they have discovered clues and solved tens of thousands of criminal cases. They have also collaborated with relevant units to handle a series of tasks related to policy implementation, household registration, and the aftermath of public security and disaster incidents. The Letters and Visits Office has received praise from the public and has been awarded the title of "Civilized Unit" twice, and has been commended for collective third-class merit.

The outstanding work of the Letters and Visits Office is closely linked to its dedicated, practical, and vibrant party branch. On September 20th, representatives from this party branch attended the national conference on advanced grassroots party organizations and outstanding party affairs workers held by the Organization Department in Beijing.

A few years ago, the party branch formulated the "four leads" that branch committee members must adhere to: leading by example in studying and implementing party policies and state laws and regulations; leading by example in overcoming difficulties and completing assigned tasks; leading by example in adhering to discipline and resisting corrupt practices and decadent ideologies; and leading by example in conducting criticism and self-criticism, combating erroneous thoughts, behaviors, and negative phenomena. Since then, these "four leads" have become the action guidelines for successive branch committees.

Those who come here to petition are mostly people who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and those who were harmed by the "leftist" line during various political movements. There are also those who are dissatisfied with the handling of cases by the public security authorities and a few who make unreasonable demands for personal gain. As China's legal system develops and improves, the legal knowledge of petitioners increases year by year, and some even bring lawyers to argue their cases. This requires reception staff to have a high level of policy and legal knowledge. The party branch encourages every colleague in the office to discuss their experiences and theories related to their work, both as teachers and students, to improve together. Initially, some colleagues were afraid to speak up. Branch Secretary Lin Hèshēng said, "I'll go first!"

The Letters and Visits Office is a convergence point for various social conflicts. In recent years, there have been phenomena such as an increase in collective petitions, petitioners threatening to cause trouble, and abnormal petitions. Therefore, the party branch has organized multiple study sessions on Deng Xiaoping's series of important speeches and articles, especially his discussions on adhering to the four cardinal principles. They have come to realize that the work of letters and visits should not just be a "fire brigade"; it should serve to maintain stability, economic construction, and the overall situation of reform and opening up.

In handling collective petitions, they adhere to the spirit of "dispersing rather than gathering, guiding rather than provoking, resolving rather than creating knots," mobilizing petitioners to return to their local areas. For abnormal petitions, they use the methods of "rapid response" and "key control," working with local public security authorities and relevant departments to form working groups to quickly resolve issues. For those attempting to cause trouble, they actively persuade and educate them about the law, while taking effective measures to control the situation and avoid escalating conflicts.

The Letters and Visits Office is a "special world." Petitioners often come with grievances or anger, speaking harshly, sometimes crying and cursing. Some mentally ill individuals may also cause disturbances. Doing letters and visits work means having people follow you to work, people bothering you after work, and not even being able to have a peaceful meal. You experience all kinds of emotions! What is even more unbearable is that some grassroots units do not welcome the higher-level letters and visits departments "exposing wounds" and delay handling issues, making letters and visits workers feel caught in the middle.

Working for a long time in such a special environment, some colleagues may become disheartened. The party branch, upon noticing this, organizes regular organizational life meetings or individual heart-to-heart talks to guide everyone to care about the people's hardships, protect the people's legal rights, and help the people solve problems. The Letters and Visits Office is a "window" for the Party and the government to connect with the people. To manage this "window" well, one needs not only a high level of political awareness and professional skills but also a broad mind and good psychological qualities. The party branch's positive guidance has had a noticeable effect. A female receptionist, who has been receiving a low salary for over 20 years, once had negative thoughts. The branch secretary and committee members had heart-to-heart talks with her and reported her specific situation to higher authorities. Her thoughts cleared up, and she handled some difficult cases excellently.

This office has 39 staff members, of whom 34 are party members. The receptionists are mostly older, female, and have health issues. However, they prioritize the interests of the Party and the people, work tirelessly, and are loved by the people.

The party branch has consistently conducted education on serving the public, maintaining integrity, and strictly requiring everyone to adhere to discipline. Over the years, they have done a lot of work to refuse gifts. Once, a petitioner threw a package of peanuts and jujubes over the wall, and they threw it back, repeating this several times. Passersby thought they were filming a movie....

The party branch of the Letters and Visits Office has long been focused on ideological and political work, and the results are now evident. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, all the staff of this office passed a severe test. No one in this office went out to protest, and no one did anything against the Party's interests. The branch held five organizational life meetings, promptly conveyed the spirit of the Public Security Bureau Party Group, and maintained consistency with the Party Central Committee. All the staff did not fear danger and stood firm at their posts. Some colleagues walked over five hours to work despite traffic disruptions. On June 3rd, they also rescued three lost soldiers and were commended by the Public Security Bureau.

### 胡同深处的“特殊世界”——记公安部信访处党支部

    胡同深处的“特殊世界”
    ——记公安部信访处党支部
    本报记者　吴　昊　袁建达
    北京市东城区东堂子胡同49号——公安部办公厅信访处。别看它在胡同深处，却有许多人慕名寻访。
    1983年以来，由信访处直接间接参与的平反冤假错案约8万余起，解决了一大批历史遗留问题；通过群众来信来访，发现线索，侦破刑事案件十几万起；配合有关单位做好一件又一件落实政策、申报户口以及治安灾害事故的善后处理……信访处受到群众称赞，被两度授予“文明单位”称号，荣记集体三等功。
    信访处的工作出色，与它有一个认真务实、朝气蓬勃的党支部分不开。9月20日，这个党支部的代表出席了中组部在北京召开的全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会。
    几年前，当时的党支部制订了支委必须做到的“四个带头”，即带头学习执行党的方针政策和国家的法律法规；带头克服困难，完成自己承担的各项工作任务；带头遵纪守法，抵制不正之风和各种腐朽思想的侵蚀；带头开展批评与自我批评，同各种错误思想、言行和不良现象作斗争。从那以后，这“四个带头”就成了历届支委的行动准则。
    到这里来上访的，大多是“文革”中受迫害和历次政治运动中受到“左”的路线伤害的人，还有对公安部门处理不服和极个别为了个人目的无理取闹者。随着我国法制建设的发展、完善，上访人的法律知识水平逐年提高，有的还带着律师来论理。这就需要接待人员有较高的政策和法律知识水平。党支部让处里的每个同志结合自己的工作情况，畅谈体会，研讨理论，既当教员，又当学生，共同提高。起初，有的同志怕讲不好，不敢讲。支部书记林鹤生说：“我先讲！”
    信访处是社会上各种矛盾的汇聚点。近年来，信访工作出现了集体上访增多、上访人中扬言制造事端的增多、异常上访增多等现象。于是，党支部多次组织大家学习邓小平同志的一系列重要讲话和文章，尤其是关于坚持四项基本原则的论述，认识到信访工作不能只当“消防队”，要为维护安定团结、经济建设和改革开放的大局服务。
    处理集体上访，他们遵循“可散不可聚，可顺不可激，可解不可结”的精神，动员上访人返回当地；对异常上访的，采用“快速反应”、“重点把关”的办法，会同地方公安机关和有关部门，组成工作小组，尽快解决；对企图制造事端的，他们一面积极规劝、晓之以法，一面采取有力措施加以控制，尽量避免矛盾激化。
    信访处是一个“特殊的世界”。上访者大多带着冤屈或怒气而来，说话难听，有时又哭又骂。有的精神病人夹杂其中，出丑闹事。做信访工作真是上班有人跟、下班有人缠，连顿踏实饭也吃不成。酸甜苦辣都尝到了！更难忍受的是有些基层单位对上级信访部门“揭疮疤”不欢迎，拖延不办，使信访工作者受“夹板气”。
    长期在这么一个特殊的环境里工作，有的同志不安心。党支部发现苗头后，通过定期召开组织生活会，或者采用个别谈心帮助等办法，引导大家关心群众疾苦，保护群众合法权益，为群众排忧解难。信访处是党和政府联系群众的一个“窗口”，办好这个“窗口”，不仅要有较高的政治水平、业务能力，还要有博大的胸怀和良好的心理素质。支部的正面引导起到了明显的作用。一位女接待员低工资拿了20多年，一度产生消极情绪。支部书记和支委一面同她谈心，一面向上级如实反映她的具体情况。她的思想通了，出色地办了一些老大难案件。
    这个处有39名工作人员，其中34名是党员。接待员年龄大的多，女同志多，体弱患病的多。但他们以党和人民的利益为重，任劳任怨，受到群众爱戴。
    党支部几年如一地进行奉公办案、为警清廉的教育，严格要求大家遵守纪律。多年来，他们为拒收礼品做了许多工作。曾有上访者把一包花生、大枣从墙头扔进来，他们扔出去，来回几次，路人还以为是在拍电影。……
    信访处党支部长期抓思想政治工作，如今已有了明显的成效。在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，全处同志经受了严峻的考验。这个处没人上街游行，没人做不符合党的利益的事。支部召开了5次组织生活会，及时传达公安部党组精神，与党中央保持一致。全处同志不怕危险，坚守岗位。有的同志在交通受阻情况下步行5个多小时坚持上班。6月3日，他们还救护3名失散的战士，受到公安部奖励。
