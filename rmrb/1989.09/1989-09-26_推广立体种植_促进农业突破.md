Editor's Note: The discussion on "How to Break the Stagnation - Agricultural Development Issues" jointly organized by our newspaper and the Ministry of Agriculture has come to an end. Over the past half year, this column has received widespread attention from society, and we have received more than 2,000 discussion articles, from which dozens have been selected and published. Participants in the discussion include agricultural experts, scholars, officials at various levels, ordinary farmers, and many "outsiders" who care about the development of China's agriculture. They have expressed their views on this important issue from different angles. Many of their opinions, suggestions, and recommendations have been enlightening and have attracted the attention of relevant management and research departments. Here, we would like to express our gratitude to all who have cared for and supported this discussion.

Although this discussion has ended, the work of strengthening and developing China's agriculture is far from complete. We are willing to continue to work with our readers to actively contribute to accelerating the modernization of China's agriculture.

What path should we take to achieve a significant breakthrough in crop production? I believe that reforming the cultivation system and implementing three-dimensional planting is an important approach. This is particularly significant for agricultural and impoverished counties with weak industrial bases.

Three-dimensional planting is based on the different characteristics of various crops, utilizing the time and space differences in their growth processes to rationally match and plant them, forming a multi-crop, multi-layered, and sequential composite group structure. According to measurements by North China Agricultural University, the light energy utilization rate for wheat and corn double-cropping is 0.95%. If three-dimensional planting is implemented, this can be increased to 2.6%, with a grain yield of 1,250 kg per mu. In 1988, 300,000 mu of farmland in our county implemented three-dimensional planting, increasing the yield by about 150 yuan per mu compared to single-crop planting of grain and cotton. Baiqiao Township's 1988 garlic-cotton intercropping increased the yield by 987 yuan per mu compared to single-crop cotton, reaching 1,247 yuan, nearly equivalent to the income from planting cotton on 5 mu of land. Yuhuangmiao Township last year implemented 15,000 mu of wheat-cotton relay planting, with a wheat yield of over 300 kg per mu and a cotton yield of 210 kg of seed cotton per mu. The entire township increased its income by 900,000 yuan, with an average increase of 30 yuan per person. The theory and practice of three-dimensional planting fully demonstrate that the economic benefits are significantly better than single-crop planting, and can greatly increase the economic income of the people.

At the same time, implementing three-dimensional planting can alleviate the contradictions between land and population, and can also adapt to the needs of the rural commodity economy and the demand for agricultural and sideline products in society.

Implementing three-dimensional planting can also fully utilize idle production factors in rural areas. Currently, the surplus labor force in rural areas is a serious problem, and with the city's reduction in construction, this problem is becoming increasingly prominent. Taking our county as an example, there are 23.49 million agricultural laborers, with a surplus of 450,000 laborers under the current cultivation system, plus 200,000 seasonal surplus laborers, totaling 650,000 surplus laborers. The county's industrial and commercial enterprises and individual businesses can accommodate 400,000 laborers, leaving 250,000 laborers with no work. However, the actual dependence of farmers on land and the tightening of credit make it impossible to fundamentally solve the surplus labor problem by relying solely on non-agricultural outlets. Through three-dimensional planting and the implementation of a multi-crop cultivation system, the planting frequency of agricultural production can be increased, and the labor time of farmers in the fields can be extended. This way, a large number of surplus laborers can find employment, and their economic income will not be lower than, and may even be higher than, that of farmers engaged in agricultural and sideline production. In Zhangshihu Village, Yinjing Township, a villager's family contracted 6 mu of farmland, and except for half a mu of greenhouse vegetable seedling cultivation, the rest was all intercropped. This alone brought the family an income of 12,000 yuan, with a per capita income of 3,000 yuan.

Looking at the prospects of three-dimensional planting, most parts of China have suitable climate, water, and soil conditions, providing feasible starting factors. For example, with the development of the commodity economy in rural areas, rural education, science and technology, and cultural undertakings have made significant progress, and the overall quality of farmers has significantly improved, with a marked increase in commodity awareness. After solving the problem of basic subsistence, under the guidance of the Party's policy of enriching the people, farmers have a strong desire to work hard and become wealthy. Multi-level and multi-form socialized service organizations have been initially established; the rural economy has a certain foundation, and the amount of currency savings among rural residents has increased.

Three-dimensional planting uses modern technology as a means of production, inherits and carries forward the essence of traditional Chinese agriculture, and uses modern agricultural ecological engineering to transform the traditional agricultural and inorganic agricultural ecological systems into a comprehensive high-level agricultural ecological system. This will directly be constrained by planting habits, social and economic environments, and nature. Therefore, in the current stage where the level of rural productivity is relatively low, it will be difficult to encourage farmers to implement three-dimensional planting, and the promotion work will be quite arduous. Therefore, we must exert great effort.

First, we must widely publicize and raise awareness to break free from the constraints of traditional planting methods. In recent years, some comrades have talked a lot about "no industry, no wealth," but have talked less about agriculture being the foundation of the national economy, thus neglecting three-dimensional planting. We must widely publicize and create public opinion to overcome the idea that "land potential has been fully exploited and development has reached its limit"; break away from the small farmer economy's idea of "small wealth is enough" and "sticking to old ways"; establish the ambition to strive for a "moderately prosperous society" and to catch up; correct the confused notion of "sparing investment and fearing risks," and establish the dialectical idea that "to take, one must first give."

Second, we must respect science and choose three-dimensional planting models that are suitable for local conditions to avoid labor in vain and losses. The selection of three-dimensional planting models should be based on local realities, ensuring the stable increase of local main crop yields and the completion of various national allocation plans. Next, we must focus on pilot projects to gradually promote three-dimensional planting. We must strongly commend and reward the leading households and successful individuals in the development of three-dimensional planting. Through focusing on typical examples and setting up models, we can make those farmers who were originally unwilling or reluctant to do it "itchy hands and eager hearts," gradually joining the ranks of developing three-dimensional planting. Finally, we must strengthen leadership and improve services to ensure the smooth implementation of three-dimensional planting.

    推广立体种植  促进农业突破
    孙洪祥
    编者按：本报与农业部联合举办的《怎样突破徘徊——农业发展问题讨论》，到此告一段落。半年多来，这个专栏受到社会普遍关注，我们共收到讨论稿件2000多篇，从中选编刊登了数十篇。参加讨论的，既有农业专家、学者，也有各级干部和普通农民，还有许多关心我国农业发展的“局外人”。他们从不同的角度，发表对这一重要问题的看法，许多观点、意见和建议，给人以启发，引起了有关主管和研究部门的重视。在此，我们谨向所有关心和支持这次讨论的同志，表示谢意。
    这次讨论虽然结束了，但加强和发展我国农业的工作远未完结。我们愿和广大读者一起，继续为加快我国农业的现代化进程积极献计出力。
    走一条什么样的路子，才能使种植业生产有一个较大的突破？我认为，改革耕作制度，实行立体种植，是重要途径之一。尤其是对工业基础薄弱的农业县、贫困县更具有重要的意义。
    立体种植是根据不同作物的不同特性，利用他们在生长过程中的时间差和空间差，合理地进行配套种植，形成多种作物、多层次、有先后次序的复合群体结构。根据华北农大测定，小麦、玉米一年两作，光能利用率为0.95％，如通过立体种植可提高到2.6％，粮食亩产可达1250公斤。1988年，我县有30万亩耕地实行了立体种植，比单一种植粮棉每亩多收150元左右。白桥乡1988年棉蒜间作比单纯植棉每亩增收987元，达到1247元，接近单一种植5亩棉花的收入。玉皇庙镇去年搞了15000亩的麦棉套种，小麦亩产达到300多公斤，棉花亩产籽棉210公斤，全镇共增收90万元，人均增收30元。立体种植的理论和实践上都充分说明，经济效益明显好于单一种植，能够大幅度的提高群众的经济收入。
    同时，实行立体种植能够缓解土地和人口的矛盾，也能适应农村商品经济发展的需要和社会对农副产品的需求。
    实行立体种植，并能充分利用农村闲置生产要素。目前，农村剩余劳力，是个严重的问题，随着城市压缩基建，这个问题愈来愈显得突出。以我县为例，现有农业劳力2349万人，按现有耕作制度，剩余劳力4.5万个，加上季节性剩余劳力2万个，共有剩余劳力6.5万个。全县工商企业和个体工商业可容纳4万个劳力，尚有2.5万个劳力无活可干，而实际存在的农民对土地的依赖和紧缩银根的形势，单纯依靠农业以外的出路不能根本解决剩余劳力问题。通过立体种植，实行一年多熟的耕作制度，可以提高农业生产的种植频率，延长农民在农田的劳动时间，这样可以使大量的剩余劳力有用武之地，其经济收入也不低于甚至高于从事工副业生产的农民。殷巷镇张泗湖村有一个村民，全家承包6亩耕地，除了半亩大棚育种蔬菜外，其余全部实行了间作套种。仅此一项，全家收入12000元，人均3000元。
    再看立体种植的前景，我国大部分地方有适宜的气候、水肥、土壤条件。
    具备了可行的启动因素。如广大农村伴随商品经济的发展，农村教育、科技、文化等事业有了长足的进步，农民的整体素质比过去有了明显提高，商品意识有显著增强；广大农民解决温饱以后，在党的富民政策感召下，产生了勤劳致富的强烈欲望，多层次、多形式的社会化服务组织已经初步建成；农村经济有了一定的基础，乡村居民中货币储存额增大。
    立体种植是以现代技术为生产手段，继承和发扬我国传统农业的精华，并运用现代农业生态工程，将传统农业和无机农业的生态系统改造成为综合的高级农业生态系统。这将直接受到种植习惯、社会经济环境和大自然的制约。因此，在现阶段农村生产力水平比较低下的情况下，要激发农民实行立体种植，将会遇到一定的困难，推广工作也会比较艰苦，所以要下大气力。
    首先必须广泛宣传，提高认识，冲破传统种植方式的束缚。近几年，有些同志对“无工不富”讲得多，而对农业是国民经济的基础讲得少，以致忽视了立体种植。要广泛宣传，大造舆论，克服“土地潜力挖尽，开发到顶”的思想；破除“小富即安”、“墨守陈规”的小农经济思想，树立攀“小康”、争上游的雄心壮志；纠正“惜投资、怕风险”的糊涂认识，树立要想取之、必先予之的辩证观念。
    其次，必须尊重科学，因地制宜地选用立体种植的模式，以免劳而无功，得不偿失。选择立体种植模式应立足本地实际，保证本地主要作物产量的稳定增长并完成国家分配的各项计划。再次抓好试点，使立体种植逐步推开。对发展立体种植的带头户、致富能人要大力表彰奖励。通过抓典型、树样板，使那些原来不愿干、不想干的农户“手发痒、心里想”，逐步加入到发展立体种植的行列中来。最后，必须加强领导，搞好服务，保证立体种植的顺利开展。
