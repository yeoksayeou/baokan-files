Communist Party Members Should Not Be "Outsiders"

The responsible comrades of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, when deploying this year's party member education work, put forward the requirement to the broad masses of Communist Party members not to be "outsiders." By "outsiders," we mean those who do not fulfill the responsibilities and obligations of party members and stand on the sidelines to criticize the party's work. As a basic requirement for party members, this is completely necessary.

Over a period of time, the trend of talking nonsense and complaining has been quite prevalent. Some party members do not engage in ideological work but instead join in the criticism. They either lament the decline of social morality, or proclaim that reform is hopeless, or blame their superiors, or complain about their ancestors' lack of effort... This kind of idle talk and criticism, which does not contribute to the current political situation, may not be deeply criticized if it occurs among ordinary people. However, if some party members and cadres, including those who hold leadership positions, also join in, it is quite puzzling.

I believe that this trend is very harmful. Our country is in a great period of transformation, with a bright future but also many difficulties. In the face of such reality, it is very important to unite thoughts, work together, and strive for common goals. However, the prevalence of idle talk and the increase in "outsiders" do not match the tasks we currently face, especially the difficulties. It disperses people's hearts, pollutes the "atmosphere," and if not handled properly, it may cause people to lose confidence in moving forward. It should be said that this is a form of liberalism that has emerged in some party members in the new era.

It should be pointed out that the actions of "outsiders" are completely different from the emancipation of thought and the broad opening of channels advocated by our party. Reform and opening up, and the construction of socialism, require people to express various opinions, discuss current affairs, and speak freely, but we must not forget the responsibilities of Communist Party members and simply stand on the sidelines to blow cold wind. This can only have a negative impact on our cause.

At present, we are cleaning up the ideological and theoretical issues that have been messed up by bourgeois liberalization. Propaganda and public opinion work face arduous tasks, especially in clearing up confusion, rectifying the fundamentals, unifying thoughts, and inspiring spirits. In this regard, every Communist Party member, especially the leading comrades at all levels, has an irresponsible responsibility. Not only should they not place themselves on the sidelines, but they should also stand on the side of the party's cause to actively educate "outsiders" and carry out necessary ideological struggles. Whether it is cleaning up thoughts or eliminating corruption, Communist Party members should put themselves in it, take more responsibilities and obligations, and contribute more wisdom and strength. They must not continue to be "outsiders." For this, I appeal: "The trend of idle talk should not be allowed to continue, and 'outsiders' should return to the ranks."

### 共产党员不能做“局外人”

　　共产党员不能做“局外人”
　　宋复泉
    内蒙古自治区党委负责同志在部署今年的党员教育工作时，向广大共产党员提出了不做“局外人”的要求。所谓“局外人”，就是指那些不履行党员的责任和义务，站在局外对党的工作评头品足的人。作为对党员的一个基本要求，这是完全必要的。
    一段时间来，说怪话、发牢骚的风气甚为盛行。一些党员不是做思想工作，而是也跟着一块起哄。他们或感叹世风日下，或宣扬改革无望，或怪罪上司，或埋怨自己的祖先不争气……这种无补于时政的清谈和责难，如果发生在普通群众中，也许未可深责；一些党员、干部，其中不乏担负领导责任的同志也加入其间，就很令人费解。
    我认为，这种风气十分有害。我们的国家正处于大变革的历史时期，前途是光明的，困难也不少。在这样的现实面前，非常需要统一思想，同心同德，团结奋斗。然而，清谈风的盛行，“局外人”的增多，与我们目前所面临的任务，尤其是面对的困难很不合拍。它涣散人心，污染“空气”，弄不好会使人们丧失前进的信心。应该说，这是新时期在一些党员中滋生的自由主义。
    这里要指出的是，“局外人”的所做所为，与我们党所倡导的解放思想、广开言路是完全不同的两码事。改革开放搞建设，需要人们发表各种意见，议论时政，畅所欲言，但绝不可以忘记共产党员的责任，一味地站在一边吹冷风，这样做只能对我们的事业起到消极作用。
    当前，我们正在清理被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想、理论问题。宣传舆论工作面临着艰巨的任务，尤其需要廓清迷雾，正本清源，统一思想，振奋精神。对此，每一个共产党员，尤其是各级领导同志，有着不可推卸的责任。不但不能把自己摆在“局外”，而且应当站在党的事业的立场去对“局外人”做积极的教育工作和必要的思想斗争。无论是清理思想也好，清除腐败也好，共产党员要把自己摆进去，多尽些责任和义务，多献些智慧力量。切不可再当“局外人”。为此，我呼吁：“清谈风”不可长，“局外人”快归队。
