Yunnan's distinctive tourism industry has become a burgeoning sector driving the province's economic revitalization.

Yunnan is home to the greatest number of ethnic minorities in China, each with unique characteristics. For centuries, the 24 ethnic minorities living here have preserved remnants of various stages of social development and diverse cultural traditions, making the region a comprehensive museum of human social evolution. Currently, the province boasts six national-level key scenic areas, including Stone Forest in Luquan, Dali, Xishuangbanna, Dianchi Lake, the Three Parallel Rivers, and Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. Additionally, there are three national-level historical and cultural cities: Kunming, Dali, and Lijiang, along with 17 national-level key cultural relics protection units. The province has opened up 29 cities and counties to the outside world. A variety of tourism projects with ethnic characteristics, such as the Torch Festival of the Yi people, mountain climbing at Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, wild azalea flower viewing, the March Street Festival in Dali, and the Water-Splashing Festival of the Dai people, have amazed international tourists. From 1979 to 1988, Yunnan received a cumulative total of 600,000 overseas tourists, earning 190 million yuan in foreign exchange. Long-term closed and economically underdeveloped counties like Luxi and Jianshui opened the Alu Ancient Cave and Swallow Cave in 1988, attracting over 1.7 million tourists and earning more than 3.5 million yuan in revenue. Villages like Shilin Wuketou and Mangjinglan in Xishuangbanna's Jinghong County, inhabited by the Yi and Dai ethnic groups, have also embarked on a path to prosperity through tourism development.

    独具特色的边疆旅游
    本报讯　云南独具特色的旅游业已成为振兴全省经济的新兴产业。
    云南是我国少数民族最多、特征鲜明的地区。千百年来，生活在这里的24个少数民族，至今仍保留着社会发展各阶段的遗迹和各种迥异的民族风情，形成了人类社会发展最完整的博物馆。现在，全省已有路南石林、大理、西双版纳、滇池、三江并流、玉龙雪山等6个国家级重点风景区；还有昆明、大理、丽江等3个国家级历史文化名城，17处国家级重点文物保护单位。全省对外开放地区已达29个市县。一大批具有民族特色的旅游项目：彝族火把节节日旅游、玉龙雪山登山旅游、野生杜鹃花观赏旅游、大理三月街民俗旅游、傣族泼水节民俗旅游……更使国际旅游者惊讶不已。1979年至1988年的10年间，云南累计接待海外游客60万人，旅游创汇1.9亿元外汇人民币。长期闭关自守、经济不发达的泸西县、建水县，1988年正式开放阿庐古洞、燕子洞，当年接待游客170多万人次，收入350多万元。彝族、傣族聚居的石林五棵树村、西双版纳景洪县曼景兰村，通过发展旅游业，也走上了致富的道路。
