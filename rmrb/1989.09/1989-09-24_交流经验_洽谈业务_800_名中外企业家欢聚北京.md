800 Chinese and foreign business leaders gathered at the Great Hall of the People this evening for a large-scale networking event to exchange experiences and discuss potential business cooperation.

Among the participants were 200 foreign business leaders from the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Delegation to China, the Thai Industrial Delegation, Wang Laboratories of the United States, and the French company Russell Chemical Company, as well as economic and commercial counselors from various foreign embassies and consulates in China. Also present were 600 Chinese business leaders from major enterprises.

Wang Shudao, Cheng Siyuan, Xue Mubiao, Ma Hong, and Lü Dong attended the networking event.

Lü Dong, on behalf of the China Industrial Economic Association, spoke at the meeting, saying that by visiting the "40 Years of China's Industry – Achievements of Large Enterprises" exhibition in Beijing, everyone can see for themselves and hear firsthand about the tremendous achievements in China's industrial construction. This will help them understand and believe that China's policy of opening up to the outside world is not a temporary measure but a long-term policy for achieving socialist modernization.
