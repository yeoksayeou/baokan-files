In July 1978, China and the United States began diplomatic talks in Beijing. After nearly half a year of negotiations, the following agreements were reached: First, the United States acknowledges China's position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China, and recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. Within this framework, the American people will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. Second, at the time of the normalization of Sino-American relations, the U.S. government announced the immediate severance of "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, and the complete withdrawal of U.S. military forces and facilities from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait by April 1, 1979. The U.S. also notified the authorities in Taiwan of the termination of the "Mutual Defense Treaty." Third, starting from January 1, 1979, both China and the United States will mutually recognize each other and establish diplomatic relations, and exchange ambassadors and establish embassies on March 1. Based on the above agreements, both sides issued the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America on December 16, 1978.

At the end of January and beginning of February 1979, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited the United States and held talks with President Carter. This was the first visit by a Chinese leader to the United States since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it was of great significance in strengthening mutual understanding between China and the United States and promoting the development of Sino-American relations. During the visit, China and the United States signed agreements on scientific and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges, as well as agreements on cooperation in the fields of education, commerce, and space, and agreements on the establishment of consular relations and the mutual opening of consulates. Both sides also agreed to facilitate the dispatch of resident journalists and decided to hold talks on the signing of trade, aviation, and maritime agreements.

    中美建交邓小平访美
      一九七八年七月，中美双方在北京开始建交谈判。经过近半年的谈判，终于达成下列协议：一、美国承认中国关于只有一个中国、台湾是中国的一部分的立场，承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，在此范围内，美国人民将同台湾人民保持文化、商务和其他非官方关系；二、在中美关系正常化之际，美国政府宣布立即断绝同台湾的“外交关系”，在一九七九年四月一日以前从台湾和台湾海峡完全撤出美国军事力量和军事设施，并通知台湾当局终止《共同防务条约》；三、从一九七九年一月一日起，中美双方互相承认并建立外交关系，三月一日互派大使、建立大使馆。在上述协议的基础上，双方于一九七八年十二月十六日发表了中美建交公报。
    一九七九年一月底二月初，邓小平副总理访问美国，同卡特总统举行了会谈。这是中华人民共和国成立后中国领导人首次访美，对加强中美双方的了解，推动中美关系的发展，具有重要意义。访问期间，中美签署了科技合作协定和文化协定，在教育、商业、空间方面进行合作的协议，以及建立领事关系和互设总领馆的协议。双方还同意为互派常驻新闻记者提供方便，并决定就签订贸易、航空和海运协定进行商谈。
