The Xianyang Qindu Hemorrhoid and Fistula Hospital in Shaanxi Province has, in the course of rectifying and regulating medical order, shown consideration for the state's difficulties and the economic burden of patients. The hospital adheres to the principle of self-reliance and thrift in medical practice, saving the state a large amount of expenditure while meeting the service needs of patients.

The hospital is located in the rural outskirts of the ancient city of Xianyang and has only six medical staff members. However, it is responsible for fifty beds and an average of fifty outpatient visits per day. Although the hospital is a state-owned unit, it does not rely on state subsidies. It only receives the salary funds allocated by the state each year, and all office expenses and medical equipment procurement and maintenance fees are solved by the hospital itself. To improve the hospital's environment and medical conditions and save state funds, the staff members boil water, cook, purchase and prepare medicines, make cotton swabs, sweep the floors, and clean the toilets. They also use their spare time and holidays to plant willows, flowers, vegetables, and herbs, making the eight-acre hospital lush with green trees and fragrant with flowers.

To convenience patients, the hospital goes to great lengths to consider the needs of patients and reduce their economic burden. The hospital has set up a nutrition kitchen, charging only the cost price, allowing patients to eat as they arrive. For emergency patients, treatment is provided first, and fees are collected later. Staff members take turns guarding the patients, feeding them, washing their hair, washing their clothes, and emptying their bedpans. Recently, a farmer from Yanshou County's Jianjun Town, after being treated for hemorrhoids and fistulas, could not pay the medical fees upon discharge. Director Zhang Chaotang not only waived his outstanding fees but also bought him a train ticket and sent him home. In addition to regular outpatient and inpatient services, the director often leads medical staff to nearby rural areas and military units to provide free check-ups and treatment for middle and primary school students and soldiers.

The hospital is famous for treating hemorrhoids and fistulas. The new drug "Shuangzhi Ling" developed by the hospital has been proven by relevant departments to have significant effects in stopping bleeding, relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and promoting tissue regeneration. It has not only cured a large number of patients with hemorrhoids and fistulas but also treated many patients with chronic sinusitis and lymph tuberculosis. Although the drug is effective, the hospital adheres to the state's prescribed pricing standards and does not charge patients an extra penny. They even spare time to go to the mountains to collect herbs and process them themselves to reduce drug costs and ease the burden on patients.

　　咸阳秦都痔瘘医院发扬延安精神
　　自力更生办院  勤俭廉洁行医
    陕西省咸阳秦都痔瘘医院在治理整顿医疗秩序中，处处体谅国家困难和患者的经济负担，坚持自力更生、勤俭办医的方针，既为国家节约了大批开支，又满足了患者的服务要求。
    这个医院地处古城咸阳远郊农村，只有六名医护人员，却担负着五十张病床和日平均门诊五十多人次的医疗任务。医院虽属全民单位，但他们不吃大锅饭，每年只接收国家拨给的工资款，办公费和医疗设备的添置、修理费等均由自己解决。为了改变院容院貌和医疗条件，为国家节约资金，他们自己烧水、做饭，自己采购、制药，做棉签，自己拖地板、扫厕所，还利用工余时间和节假日，自己动手插柳栽花、种菜种药，使一个占地八亩的医院满眼绿树成荫，一片鲜花芬芳。
    为了方便病人，他们千方百计为患者着想，处处减轻病家的经济负担。医院办了营养灶，只收成本费，病人随到随吃。凡急症病人入院，一律先治疗、后交费，工作人员轮流守护，给病人喂饭、洗头、洗衣服、倒便盆。不久前，永寿县监军镇一位农民，治好痔瘘病出院时，交不起医药费，院长张潮堂不但免了他的欠费，还代购车票送他回家。除正常门诊、住院工作外，院长还经常带领医护人员到附近农村和部队，为中小学生和指战员免费查体治病。
    这个医院以治疗痔瘘出名，他们研制的治痔新药“双止灵”经有关部门鉴定证明，其止血、止痛、消炎和去腐生肌作用十分显著，不但治好了大批患痔疮、瘘管的病人，还治好了不少慢性鼻窦炎和淋巴结核患者。药灵疗效高，但他们坚持国家规定的收费标准，不多收患者一分钱，甚至腾出时间自己上山采药自行炮制，以降低药物成本，减轻患者负担。  张志强
