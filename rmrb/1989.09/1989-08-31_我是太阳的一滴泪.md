Lawrence Ferlinghetti (1920–), a renowned contemporary American poet, was the oldest and most mature member of the "Beat Generation" poets of the 1950s.

He spent his childhood in an orphanage. During World War II, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy. After the war, he earned a master's degree from Columbia University and a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1951. His works include the poetry collections *Pictures of the Gone World* (1955) and *Coney Island of the Mind* (1958), the novel *Her*, the play collection *The Big Bite*, and the travelogue *Mexico City Blues*. Ferlinghetti is best known for his poetry, which has been widely popular in the United States, particularly among the youth. He is also actively involved in political activities and has written several influential political poems, such as *For a Banquet in Honor of the Impeachment of President Eisenhower* and *Where Is Vietnam?*

His thoughts are agile, and his language is sharp, simple, and fluent. His gaze penetrates the surface of the world, touching various domains of society and different layers of the soul, fearlessly revealing the chaos, contradictions, and fragmented lives he observes, often with a hint of mockery. His poetry is life-like and colloquial, relatively clear and straightforward, rich in implications, and imbued with a certain philosophical depth that invites contemplation. He criticizes social injustices and sympathizes with ordinary workers, saying, "I am a tear of the sun." The poet gazes at the stern truth, sketching the hell and heaven of the poetic realm with intense passion and extraordinary intelligence. He stands out as a unique figure among the Beat poets.

In 1952, Ferlinghetti founded the "City Lights" bookstore in San Francisco, which became a gathering point and publisher for the Beat poets, including Ginsberg, during the 1950s and 1960s. It remains an active center for poets in the San Francisco area.

    “我是太阳的一滴泪”
    黎华
    劳伦斯·费林杰梯（一九二○——），美国当代著名诗人，五十年代“垮掉的一代”诗人中唯一年纪较大的人，也是他们中最成熟的人。
    他幼时进孤儿院。第二次世界大战时他当过美国海军军官。战后在哥伦比亚大学获硕士学位，一九五一年在巴黎大学获博士学位。作品有诗集《已逝的世界的图画》（一九五五年），《心灵中的柯尼岛》（一九五八年），长篇小说《她的》，剧本集《例行公事》，旅行记《墨西哥之夜》等。费林杰梯最负盛名的还是他的诗，那些脍炙人口之作，在美国广受欢迎，特别是在青年中引起强烈反响。他也热心于参加政治活动，写过不少有影响的政治诗，如《为弹劾艾森豪威尔总统举办的宴会而作》和《越南在哪里？》等。
    他思想敏捷，语言锐利、朴实、流畅。他的目光透过世界的表面，触及社会的各个领域、心灵的不同层次，毫无顾忌地把所看到的感到的一切混乱、矛盾、被剪断的生活碎片，用略带嘲讽的调子揭示出来。他的诗生活化，口语化，比较明朗清晰，蕴含寓意，具有某种引人思索的哲理味。他抨击社会不平，同情普通劳动者，他说：“我是太阳的一滴泪。”诗人瞩望着严峻的真理，以高度热情和非凡的才智勾画出诗国中的地狱和天堂。他在“垮掉派”中是个与众不同的人物。
    一九五二年，费林杰梯在旧金山创办“城市之光”书店，在五十、六十年代是以金斯堡等为代表的“垮掉的一代”诗人们的集合点和出版社，它至今仍是旧金山一带诗人的活动中心。
