Before liberation, China had only about 30 research institutions. In November 1949, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was established. At the same time, various industrial departments and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also began to set up research institutions. By 1955, the number of scientific and technological research institutions nationwide had reached 850. By 1987, there were 5,568 independent research and development institutions at the county level and above, with an annual expenditure of 10.847 billion yuan. Additionally, there were 138 national-level natural science societies and 1,571 affiliated branch societies, participating in 261 international academic organizations. Through the Chinese Association for Science and Technology and the Chinese Science Popularization Association, a science popularization organization network has been formed nationwide: 5 national-level science popularization organizations, 79 provincial-level organizations, and 29,500 county-level societies. There are 4,278 factory and mining science associations and 47,557 township science associations.

Over the past 40 years, China has formed a large research team with considerable academic level and breakthrough capabilities. This research force has a certain advantage among developing countries, and in some fields, it can compete with developed countries.

    科研机构从30个发展到5000多
    解放前我国的科研机构只有30余个。1949年11月，中国科学院成立。同时，各产业部门和各省、市、自治区也纷纷组建科研机构。1955年，全国科学技术研究机构达850个。到1987年，全国县以上部门属的独立研究与开发机构5568个。年度经费支出108.47亿元。另外，省以上全国性自然科学学会138个，他们所属分科学会1571个，参加国际学术组织261个。同时，通过中国科协和中国科普协会，在全国形成了科普组织网络：全国性科普团体5个，省级团体79个，县级学会2.95万个。厂矿和乡镇科协各为4278个和47557个。
    40年来，我国已形成一支庞大的、有相当学术水平和攻坚能力的研究队伍。这支科研力量，在发展中国家里具有一定优势，某些领域已可同发达国家相抗衡。
