The great People's Republic of China is celebrating its 40th anniversary. In this joyous time of national celebration, I am filled with surging emotions and endless thoughts.

Since childhood, I have loved physical exercise, particularly weightlifting. However, this was just a hobby, and despite my efforts, I didn't achieve much. In early 1955, I had the fortune to join the Central South Military Region weightlifting team and was soon transferred to the August First Team and the National Youth Team, thus beginning my weightlifting career.

In the early days of the founding of the nation, everything was in ruins and needed to be rebuilt. At that time, economic conditions were difficult, but the Party assigned me a good coach and provided me with the best possible food, housing, and training conditions. My weightlifting skills improved rapidly. On June 7, 1956, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Competition in Shanghai, I lifted 133 kilograms in the clean and jerk, breaking the world record of 132.5 kilograms held by American C. Vinch. I became the first Chinese athlete to set a world record, ending the history of China having no world champions and achieving a "zero" breakthrough. This event had a significant impact both domestically and internationally.

After achieving this feat, the Party and the people bestowed great honors upon me. The older generation of Party and state leaders, including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Liu Shaoqi, successively received me and encouraged me to continue striving for greater glory. This made me deeply realize that a revolutionary youth must closely tie their fate to the motherland and strive for national glory and the rejuvenation of China as their ideal. Only then can life have meaning, and achievements can be made.

When I broke the world record for the third time, my lumbar vertebrae had several tears, and the doctor advised me to change my career, warning that continuing to train would result in paralysis of the lower body. "Paralysis" is indeed a frightening word, but at that time, it was the ideal of serving the country that gave me strength. I thought: the country had worked so hard to cultivate an athlete, and if I retreated in the face of injury, it would be too shameful. Therefore, I decided to continue. Even if I could not create another world record for the country, I could explore the experience of training while recovering from injuries, paving the way for future climbers. Under the guidance of my coach and doctor, I broke the world record six more times, bringing glory to the motherland time and time again, making my career meaningful, and my youth radiant.

The wheels of the motherland roll forward. Today, as we joyfully welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I see that our country has made tremendous achievements in building two civilizations. The sports sector has undergone unprecedented changes. In the past 40 years, athletes from my hometown, Guangdong Province, have won 106 world championships and broken, surpassed, or equaled world records dozens of times, truly a constellation of stars. As an old athlete, I am deeply gratified to see a large number of young people growing up under the nurturing of the Party and the people, becoming excellent athletes, and making outstanding contributions to the rejuvenation of China on the domestic and international sports stages.

Since 1973, I have been working in the leadership team of the Guangdong Provincial Sports Commission. The responsibility on my shoulders is heavy, and I will definitely follow the Party's teachings, be loyal to the Party's sports line and policies, and strive to develop socialist sports and cultivate sports talents.

    在祖国的怀抱里成长
    中国举重协会主席　陈镜开
    伟大的中华人民共和国诞生40周年了，在举国欢庆的日子里，我心潮澎湃，浮想联翩。
    我自小喜爱锻炼身体，尤以健身举重为最。但这只是一种爱好，几经折腾也搞不出什么名堂。1955年初我有幸加入中南军区举重队，并很快被输送到八一队和国家青年队，从此开始了举重生涯。
    建国初期，百废待兴。当时经济生活比较困难，但是，党给我派了好教练，尽可能给我提供较好的食、住和训练条件。我举重的成绩提高很快。1956年6月7日，在上海举行的中苏友谊赛中，我挺举起133公斤，打破了美国C·温奇保持的最轻量级世界纪录。我成了第一个创造世界纪录的中国运动员，结束了我国没有世界冠军的历史，实现了“零”的突破，在国内外引起广泛的反响。
    做出成绩后党和人民给我很高荣誉。毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇等老一辈党和国家领导人先后接见了我，并勉励我继续努力，争取更大光荣。使我深切体会到，一个革命青年，必须把自己的命运和祖国紧密联结起来，把为国争光、振兴中华作为自己的理想，这样，生活才有意义，事业才有所成就。
    当我第三次打破世界纪录的时候，我的腰椎骨已有几处撕裂，医生劝我改行，说是继续苦练下去，会导致下半身瘫痪的。“瘫痪”，当然是吓人的字眼，当时是一种以身报国的理想给了我力量。我想：国家很不容易才培育一个运动员，倘若在伤病面前打退堂鼓，太惭愧了，于是我下决心继续干下去，就算不能为国家再创世界纪录，也可以摸索边练边治伤的经验，为后来的攀登者探路。在教练、医生的指导之下，我又先后6次打破世界纪录，一次次为祖国争得光荣，使我从事的事业充满意义，青春放射出耀眼的光彩。
    祖国的车轮滚滚向前，今天，当我们高兴地迎接国庆40周年的时候，我看到我国的两个文明建设取得巨大成就，体育战线更是发生前所未有的巨大变化。40年来，仅我的故乡广东省体育健儿就先后夺取了106个世界冠军，破、超、平世界纪录达几十人次之多，真是明星璀璨。我作为一个老运动员，看到大批青少年在党和人民的哺育下成长为优秀运动员，在国内外体坛上建功立业，为振兴中华作出出色的贡献，心中有说不尽的欣慰。
    从1973年起，我进入广东省体委的领导班子工作，肩上的担子重了，我一定遵照党的教导，忠诚于党的体育路线、方针，为发展社会主义体育事业、培育体育人才努力奉献。
