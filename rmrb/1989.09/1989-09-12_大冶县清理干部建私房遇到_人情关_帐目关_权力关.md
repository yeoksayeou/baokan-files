In recent years, the situation of officials in Daye County, Hubei, building private houses has been quite serious. Preliminary statistics show that there are over 900 households of officials building private houses, including more than 260 households at the deputy section chief level and above. Some leading officials have built dozens of private houses in four areas with good geographical locations in the city center: Chengbei, Dongfeng Road, Wuli Jie, and Guafu Di. The locals call these areas "Daye's Official Village."

A relevant department official told me that among those officials who built private houses, most already have public housing. They do not vacate their public housing but rent out their private houses. The new private houses built by officials at the deputy county level and above are of high quality, mostly two or three-story buildings with polished stone floors, wooden floors, and luxurious indoor facilities. One county-level official built a three-story building with an area of about 500 square meters, with a total construction and decoration cost of about 60,000 yuan. A deputy county-level official's private house has a water-washed stone exterior, a copper wire-inlaid polished stone floor, a wooden floor upstairs, a nearly 100-square-meter courtyard, and is very grand. It is understood that many officials in Daye County used steel, cement, bricks, sand, and wood and other building materials from relevant units in the county to build their private houses. Some were bought at "preferential prices," while others were obtained through "arrears" or "white slips." According to a township official's confession, a deputy county-level official built a house, and he sent two cubic meters of wood on behalf of the public without charging a penny. This township official was punished for economic problems, while that deputy county-level official remained unscathed. The Daye County Party Committee decided to tackle the problem of officials building private houses as a major task for the year. However, half a year has passed, and there has been little progress. According to those involved in the cleanup, "Various levels of government have issued documents, only requiring the content of the cleanup, but without specifying how to handle it. We are worried that we might end up biting off more than we can chew."

Currently, those involved in the cleanup of officials building private houses face "three hurdles": First, the human relations hurdle. When investigating one person, intercessors come; when investigating a county-level official's problem, the investigating officials work under him, and they can't save face or have the courage to investigate. Second, the accounting hurdle. Issues such as what materials were bought and from which unit they were bought are not clearly explained by some house builders, and some production units do not allow investigations. Third, the power hurdle. The personnel involved in the cleanup of private houses are officials from relevant departments, and they cannot investigate county-level and above officials and powerful leading officials, and some refuse to be investigated.

For this reason, those involved in the cleanup of officials building private houses suggest: It would be best for the higher-level department to clean up the problems of the subordinate lower-level units, or to exchange cleanup duties. Relevant departments should also formulate handling regulations that match the cleanup.

### 大冶县清理干部建私房遇到——人情关　帐目关　权力关

　　大冶县清理干部建私房遇到——
　　人情关　帐目关　权力关
    近几年，湖北大冶县干部建私房的情况较为严重。据初步统计，这个县干部建私房的共有900多户，其中副科级以上的260多户。一些领导干部在城关的城北、东风路、五里界、寡妇堤4处地理位置较好的地段，分别建造了几十户私房，群众称之为“大冶的官府村”。
    有关部门同志对我说，在那些建私房的干部中，大多数人都有公房。他们公房不退，私房出租。副县级以上的领导干部新建的私房档次高，大都是两三层的楼房，水磨石地面，木质地板，室内设施豪华。有一名县级干部建了一栋三层楼房，面积约500平方米，造价和装饰费用总计约6万元。一位副县级干部的私房，外墙是水刷石，地面是铜丝嵌花水磨石，楼上是木质地板，有近百平方米小院，雕梁画栋，很是气派。据了解，大冶县许多干部建私房用的钢材、水泥、砖瓦、黄沙、木材等建筑材料，都是从本县有关单位弄来的，有的是以“优惠价”买的，有的是“欠款”或
  “打白条”搞来的。据一个乡干部交代，一位副县级干部盖房，他以公家名义送去两立方米木料，未收一分钱。这个乡干部因经济问题受到处理，而那个副县级干部却丝毫无损。大冶县委曾决定把清理干部建私房问题作为今年的一件大事来抓。但是，半年多过去了，没见多大动静。据搞清理的同志说：“各级政府都发文件，只要求清理的内容，却没有规定怎样处理。我们担心打蛇不成反被蛇咬。”
    目前，清理干部建私房的同志难过“三关”：一是人情关。查一个人，说情的就来了；查一个县级干部的问题，搞清查的同志在他手下工作，面子上过不去，也没有胆量查。二是帐目关。盖房子买什么材料，从哪个单位买的等问题，有的建房人不讲清楚，有的生产单位不让查。三是权力关。清理私房人员都是有关部门的干部，对县级以上干部和掌握实权的领导干部，无法查问，有的拒绝查问。
    为此，搞清理干部建私房的同志建议：最好是上一级部门清理所属下级的问题，也可以易地交换清理。有关部门还应制定与清理相配套的处理规定。
