I am a teacher of the people, I dedicate myself to my work. I do not belong to ancient tombs, I am a pioneer in exploration, I am pure and fragrant, I am the air that everyone breathes. Between ignorance and wisdom, I build a golden bridge. The pillars are my shoulders, the surface is my back—through this, in the name of a soul engineer of humanity, proudly sending out a message of green, shining light to the world. In my palm, white rays ignite the suspended night. I am an inexhaustible spring, I am the eternal budding force. I believe that one day, when white snow covers my head, I will proudly say: Motherland, I have not let down the honor of being a teacher. I am a teacher of the people, I dedicate myself to my work… I firmly believe in my students, they will become farmers, workers, experts… I do not choose the official path of life, I do not! My file will always be stamped with the bright red national emblem.

Ferryman
Dedicated to an old teacher with thirty years of teaching experience

He compares the classroom to a boat, and himself to the ferryman. From his mouth, waves of love surge, pushing the ferry towards the other shore. The bell for class is the command to set sail, the blackboard is the sail of seeking knowledge. Thus, he uses chalk as oars, dedicating his life in silence…

　　我献身我的工程（外一首）
　　陈显涪我是人民教师，我献身我的工程。我不属于旷古的坟茔，我是探索的前驱，我纯洁、芬芳，我是人人吮吸的空气，我在愚昧和智慧之间，修筑起一座金桥。桥墩是我的肩膀，桥面是我的背脊，——通过，以一位人类灵魂工程师的名义，骄傲地向世界发出
          绿光闪闪的信息。在我的掌心上，白色霞光点燃了悬挂的黑夜。我是不竭的流泉，我是永远萌发的力。我相信，当有一天白雪盖满我的头顶，我将自豪地说：祖国，我没有辜负教师的荣誉。我是人民教师，我献身我的工程……我坚信我的学生，会成为农民、工人、专家……我不选择人生的宦途前进，我不！我的档案上，永远盖着鲜红国徽的大印。
　  摆渡人
    献给一位三十年教龄的老教师他把教室比喻成一条船，自己就是摆渡人。从口中涌出波澜般的爱恋，推送渡船驶向彼岸。上课铃就是启锚的命令，黑板就是求知的风帆。就这样，他用粉笔做桨，终身都在默默地奉献……
