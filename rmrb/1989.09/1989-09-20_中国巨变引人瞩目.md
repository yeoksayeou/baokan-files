Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

	“China's Tremendous Changes Attract Global Attention”
	By Zhang Liang, Our Correspondent

	“Although I am not a historian, I have some understanding of China before and after 1949. Old China was extremely backward in its economy, chaotic in society, and the people suffered greatly, enduring much oppression from foreign powers. Since the founding of New China, the Chinese people have made significant progress in economics, healthcare, science and technology, and cultural education. Especially in recent years, the tremendous changes have been particularly eye-catching…” This was the statement made by Mr. Pattani, the president of the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association, in a recent interview with our correspondent.

	Mr. Pattani's understanding and knowledge of New China are not limited to reading books and newspapers; rather, they come mainly from what he has seen and heard over the past 40 years of China's achievements in various fields. Shortly after the opening of Sino-American relations in 1972, Mr. Pattani visited China for the first time, fulfilling his long-held wish. Last spring, he made his 12th visit to China and deeply felt that “due to the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, China has indeed made great economic progress in the past 10 years. Wherever we went, we found bustling markets, abundant consumer goods, and a noticeable improvement in people's lives.” He particularly mentioned that every time he visited rural areas in China, he discovered new changes. “Farmers' incomes have increased several times, new and stylish houses are everywhere, and their clothing is rich and colorful. They are optimistic and confident, their minds are more open, and they are willing to discuss various issues.” He happily told the reporter that all these changes are inspiring, and the diligence and wisdom shown by the Chinese people in building their own country have left a deep impression on him.

	Mr. Pattani has a deep affection for the Chinese people. He has done a lot of beneficial work for China's modernization and the development of Sino-American relations. After visiting China in 1974, he established the Minnesota Chapter of the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association in his hometown of Minnesota and served as the chapter president. With his active promotion and assistance, along with that of other American friends in the chapter, Minnesota and Shaanxi Province became sister states. In recent years, the relationship between these two sister states has continued to develop, and in addition to various people-to-people exchanges, mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade sectors is gradually expanding.

	In 1987, Mr. Pattani was honored to be elected president of the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association. Over the past two years, he has devoted a great deal of energy to the cause of Sino-American friendship. To enhance friendship and understanding between the peoples of the two countries, the U.S.-China Peoples Friendship Association organizes hundreds of people to travel to China every year. In addition, various regional chapters hold seminars or discussion meetings on China-related issues, allowing more Americans to learn about China. In the early years when China began sending students to the United States, many regional chapters also specially organized English remedial classes for Chinese students, helping them to quickly adapt to their studies and life in the United States.

	When parting, Mr. Pattani asked the reporter to convey his best wishes to the Chinese people. He firmly believes that “the Chinese people will surely achieve even greater success in the coming years.”

　　“中国巨变引人瞩目”
    本报记者　张亮
    “虽然我不是历史学家，但我对1949年之前和之后的中国还是有所了解的。旧中国经济极端落后，社会混乱，民不聊生，受尽外来势力的蹂躏。新中国成立之后，中国人民在经济、医疗卫生、科学技术和文化教育等领域都取得了很大进步，特别是最近几年的巨大变化更引人瞩目……。”这是美中友好协会会长普塔戚尼最近接受本报记者采访时的谈话。
    普塔戚尼先生对新中国的认识和了解不局限于读书看报，更主要的是耳闻目睹了40年来中国在各条战线所取得的成就。1972年中美关系的大门打开后不久，普塔戚尼先生首次访华，实现了他多年来的愿望。去年春天，他第12次访问了中国，深有感触地说：“由于实行改革开放政策，最近10年来中国在经济上的确取得了很大发展。所到之处，我们都发现市场繁荣，消费品比较充足，人民生活明显改善。”他特别提到，他每次到中国农村参观都会发现新的变化。“农民的收入成倍增加，新颖的住宅到处可见，衣着丰富多彩。他们乐观自信，思想也比较开放，愿意讨论各种问题。”他高兴地告诉记者，这一切变化都是令人鼓舞的，而中国人民在建设自己的国家时所表现出的勤劳和智慧也给他留下了深刻的印象。
    普塔戚尼先生对中国人民有着深厚的感情，他为中国的现代化建设和美中关系的发展做了不少有益的工作。1974年访华后，他在家乡明尼苏达州组建了美中友协明尼苏达分会，并担任分会会长。在他和分会其他美国朋友的积极推动和协助下，明尼苏达州和陕西省结为友好省州。近年来这对友好省州的关系不断发展，除了各种民间交流外，双方在经贸等领域的互利合作也在逐步扩大。
    1987年普塔戚尼先生荣幸地当选为美中友协会长。两年来，他把相当多的精力倾注于美中友好事业。为了增进两国人民的友谊和了解，美中友协每年都组织数百人到中国旅游。此外，各地区分会还举办有关中国问题的报告会或讨论会，让更多的美国人了解中国。在中国开始向美国派遣留学生的最初几年里，许多地区分会还专门为中国留学生举办英语补习班，使他们能尽快适应在美国的学习和生活。
    话别时，普塔戚尼先生希望记者向中国人民转达他的良好祝愿。他深信，“中国人民在未来的年代里一定会取得更大成就。”
