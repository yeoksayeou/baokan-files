    全国足球甲级队联赛A组赛事再起
    国家二队积分继续领先
    本报天津9月21日电　全国足球甲级队联赛A组的8支队伍，今天开始在天津和济南两地同时进行第二循环首轮交锋。
    辽宁队在中场主将王军累计两次黄牌缺场的情况下，上半时被八一队郝海东攻破球门。下半时第27分钟，辽宁队中卫赵发庆射中一球，双方以1∶1战成平手。天津中环队在家乡父老面前表现并不出色，虽然王凯在下半时为天津队首先破门，但上海队在唐全顺吃红牌离场后，10个人与天津队11人周旋，反倒连进3球，以3∶1战胜天津中环队。
    在济南进行的两场比赛，国家二队3∶2战胜广州队，继续保持积分领先。东道主山东队1∶1战平广东队。
