Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 12th.

After 40 years of arduous efforts, China has entered the ranks of world powers in many important scientific and technological fields, including space technology, biotechnology, and nuclear technology.

At the beginning of the liberation period, China had only a few dozen research institutes and over 40,000 scientific and technological personnel. Today, China has over 9.66 million scientific and technological personnel, forming a comprehensive and rationally structured scientific and technological system.

In the autumn of 1964, the first mushroom cloud that rose in the western region was the first thunderclap in China's major scientific and technological fields. Over the past 25 years, we have not only mastered the technologies of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and nuclear submarines, but our achievements in the peaceful use of nuclear energy have also attracted global attention. In less than 20 years, we have successfully launched 25 artificial earth satellites, 11 of which have returned to the ground as planned. China is the third country in the world, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to master satellite recovery technology.

China was the first in the world to synthesize bovine insulin. In the study of the origin of life, China is ahead of the world. The invention of the world's highest-yielding hybrid rice, which pushed the green revolution to the other side of the ocean, was made in China. Launching three satellites with one rocket and being known as one of the "four strong" countries in "one rocket, multiple satellites" alongside the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, was achieved by China. In the global "superconductivity fever," China dared to lead alongside the United States and Japan and temporarily took the lead twice.

According to the China Science and Technology Information Institute's computer retrieval, among the more than 10,000 major scientific and technological achievements made in the country each year in recent years, those that are generally ahead in certain aspects number in the thousands.

Of course, from an overall perspective, the gap between China's scientific and technological level and the goal of the Four Modernizations is still significant. Under the reform and opening-up situation, the road ahead for China's scientific and technological work is still rugged and long.

　　我许多重要科技领域已跻身世界强国行列
    据新华社北京9月12日电　（记者卓培荣、陈金武）经过40年的艰难曲折，我国空间技术、生物技术、核技术等许多重要科技领域，已跻身于世界强国之列。
    解放初期，我国仅有几十个研究所，4万多科技人员。今天我国的科技人员已达966万多人，形成了学科齐全、布局合理的科技体系。
    1964年秋，西部地区腾起的第一朵蘑菇云，是我国重大科技领域的第一声惊雷。经过25年来的不断开拓，我们不仅掌握了原子弹、氢弹和核潜艇技术，在核能和平利用方面的成就也举世瞩目。在不到20年的时间里，我们已成功地发射了25颗人造地球卫星，其中11颗按预定计划返回地面。我国已是美、苏之后世界上第三个掌握卫星回收技术的国家。
    我国在世界上首次合成了牛胰岛素，在生命起源研究方面领先于世界的是我国；发明当今世界效益最高的农作物籼型杂交水稻，把绿色革命风波推向大洋彼岸的是我国；用一枚火箭发射三颗卫星，同美、苏、法并称“一箭多星”四强的是我国；在世界性“超导热”中，敢和美、日共居排头，并且两度暂时领先的也是我国……
    据中国科技情报所计算机检索，在近几年每年全国取得的1万多项重大科技成果中，某些方面领先于世界的，一般都有两三千项。
    当然，从整体上说，我国科技水平同四个现代化目标的距离仍然是大的。在改革开放形势下，我国科技工作面前的路仍然崎岖而漫长。
