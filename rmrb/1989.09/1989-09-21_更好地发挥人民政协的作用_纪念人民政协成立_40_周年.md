It is once again the season of cool autumn breezes. We are filled with joy as we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

Forty years ago today, more than 600 representatives from various strata of society gathered in Beijing to hold the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an event of great historical significance. That conference exercised the functions of the National People's Congress, adopted the "Common Program" of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which served as a provisional constitution, formulated the "Organic Law of the Central People's Government," decided on the capital, national flag, and national anthem of New China, elected the Central People's Government with Mao Zedong as chairman, and proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Over the past 40 years, the People's Political Consultative Conference has traversed a glorious path, becoming an organization of the broad patriotic united front led by the Communist Party of China. It includes representatives from various democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, and patriotic figures from all walks of life, encompassing all socialist laborers and patriots who support national reunification. It has become an important channel for promoting socialist democracy within China's political system and a crucial organizational form for the Communist Party's leadership in multi-party cooperation. The People's Political Consultative Conference has played a significant role in establishing and consolidating the people's democratic government, carrying out socialist revolution and construction, maintaining national unity, social stability, and ethnic solidarity. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the political consultation and democratic supervision system of the People's Political Consultative Conference has seen significant development. It has made new contributions to promoting reform, opening up, and the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization and democratic legal system, advancing the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and developing friendly relations between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world. Forty years of experience, both positive and negative, have shown that whether the People's Political Consultative Conference is valued or neglected, strengthened or weakened, and whether its role is fully played, has a significant impact on the stability and prosperity of the country.

Recently, Beijing experienced a shocking political storm. In this storm, the People's Political Consultative Conference underwent a severe test. The various democratic parties and patriotic democratic figures in our country truly demonstrated their solidarity with the Communist Party, sharing both glory and disgrace. "Strong winds reveal sturdy grass, and adversity reveals true hearts." Practice has proven that the foundation of our patriotic united front is solid, and its future is bright.

After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, some comrades wondered if the Communist Party's policy of unity would change? Such concerns are entirely unnecessary. Recently, leaders of the Party Central Committee have repeatedly emphasized in various settings that the patriotic united front is a policy advocated by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and gradually formed and developed in the process of leading the revolution and construction. It is one of the three magic weapons of the Communist Party for victory. The People's Political Consultative Conference is an important organizational form for the long-term cooperation between our Party and various democratic parties and figures from all walks of life. The Party's policy of unity will not only not change because of this political storm but will also be further improved and developed on the existing basis. We must unite all those who can be united and mobilize all positive factors to develop the broadest patriotic united front, working together to build our country.

Consolidating and expanding the patriotic united front is key to upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no united front, and there would be no People's Political Consultative Conference. Through long-term political practice and after experiencing both the joys of victory and the pains of defeat, the Chinese people have chosen the leadership of the Communist Party. This leadership is not self-proclaimed by the Communist Party but is formed in the struggle and recognized by the people. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, we cannot grasp the direction, and we cannot achieve national independence and the modernization of socialist construction. China cannot adopt the Western-style multi-party system. We practice a system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. China's democratic construction has its own characteristics. If we blindly and mechanically copy the political systems of Western or other countries to handle our country's party relations, and try to establish a multi-party system that excludes the leadership of the Communist Party, the result will inevitably destroy the political foundation of the patriotic united front, undermine the great unity of the people of the whole country, and harm the cause of socialism and national independence. This does not serve the interests of the Communist Party, nor does it serve the interests of the various democratic parties.

In our country, there is the Communist Party, and there are also eight democratic parties and non-partisan patriots and various people's organizations. The relationship between the Communist Party and these parties is not one of ruling and opposition, nor is it one of executive and opposition parties. Instead, it is a relationship of unity and cooperation for common goals, a relationship of mutual consultation and supervision. Both our Party and the democratic parties support the system of people's congresses and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must adhere to this system, which is both in line with national conditions and effective.

The People's Political Consultative Conference has a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. We believe that in the long years to come, it will surely better fulfill its functions of "political consultation and democratic supervision," making greater contributions to advancing China's socialist democratic process and building a modern socialist power.

### 更好地发挥人民政协的作用——纪念人民政协成立40周年

    更好地发挥人民政协的作用
    ——纪念人民政协成立40周年
    又是金风送爽时节。我们以喜悦的心情纪念人民政协成立四十周年。
    四十年前的今天，600多位各阶层人民代表齐集北平，召开了具有伟大历史意义的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议。那次会议执行全国人民代表大会的职权，通过了具有临时宪法作用的《中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领》，制定了《中央人民政府组织法》，决定了新中国的首都、国旗和国歌，选举了以毛泽东为主席的中央人民政府，宣告中华人民共和国成立。
    四十年来，人民政协走过了光辉的路程，成为由中国共产党领导的，有各民主党派、无党派爱国人士、人民团体、少数民族人士和各界爱国人士参加的，包括全体社会主义劳动者和拥护祖国统一的爱国者的代表人物在内的、广泛的爱国统一战线组织，成为我国政治体制中发扬社会主义民主的重要渠道和共产党领导的多党合作的重要组织形式。人民政协在建立和巩固人民民主政权，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，维护国家统一、社会安定和各族人民的团结等方面，发挥了重要的历史作用。中共十一届三中全会以来，人民政协的政治协商、民主监督制度有了很大发展，为推动改革、开放与社会主义物质文明、精神文明和民主法制建设，促进祖国和平统一，发展我国人民同世界各国人民的友好关系，作出了新的贡献。四十年正反两方面经验表明，对人民政协是重视还是忽视，是加强还是削弱，是否充分发挥其作用，对国家的稳定与繁荣有着极大的影响。
    前不久，北京发生了一场惊心动魄的政治风波。在这场风波中，人民政协经受了严峻的考验，我国的各民主党派和各界爱国民主人士真正做到了与共产党“肝胆相照，荣辱与共”。“疾风知劲草，患难见人心”，实践证明，我们的爱国统一战线的基础是牢固的，前景是广阔的。
    平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，有的同志担心党的统一战线政策会不会变？这种担心完全是多余的。最近，党中央领导同志在多种场合一再强调，爱国统一战线是毛泽东、周恩来等老一辈无产阶级革命家一贯倡导、并在领导革命和建设的过程中逐步形成和发展的，是共产党克敌制胜的三大法宝之一。人民政协是我们党与各民主党派和各界人士长期合作的重要组织形式。党的统一战线政策不但不会因为这次政治风波而改变，而且还要在现有的基础上进一步完善和发展。我们要团结一切可以团结的人，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，发展最广泛的爱国统一战线，齐心协力建设我们国家。
    巩固和扩大爱国统一战线，关键是坚持中国共产党的领导。没有中国共产党就不可能有统一战线，也不可能有人民政协。中国人民在长期的政治实践中，在饱尝了胜利的欢乐和失败的痛苦后，选择了中国共产党的领导。这个领导不是中国共产党自封的，是在斗争中形成的，是人民公认的。没有中国共产党的领导，就不能把握方向，就不可能实现国家民族的独立和进行社会主义现代化建设。中国绝不能搞西方那种多党制，我们实行的是共产党领导下的多党合作。中国的民主建设有自己的特色，如果盲目地、机械地照搬西方或别的国家的政治方式来处理我国的党派关系，在中国搞排斥共产党的领导的多党制，其结果必然破坏爱国统一战线的政治基础，破坏全国人民的大团结，损害社会主义的事业和民族的独立。这既不符合共产党的利益，也不符合各民主党派的利益。
    在我们的国家里，有共产党，还有8个民主党派和无党派爱国人士、各人民团体。共产党与他们的关系不是朝野关系，不是执政党和反对党关系，而是为了共同目标团结合作的关系，共同协商、互相监督的关系。我们党与民主党派都赞成人民代表大会制度，赞成共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度。我们要坚持这种既符合国情又行之有效的制度。
    人民政协任重而道远。我们相信，在今后漫长的岁月中，她一定能更好地履行“政治协商、民主监督”的职能，为推进我国的社会主义民主进程，为建设现代化的社会主义强国作出更大的贡献。
