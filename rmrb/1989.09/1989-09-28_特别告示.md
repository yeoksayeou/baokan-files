On August 24th of this year, a "Special Notice" was posted at the entrance of the fruit purchasing station in Shanghe Township, Zou County, Shandong Province. The notice stated: "Currently, a large quantity of fruit is about to be harvested. To meet the needs of our customers, please contact the Shanghe Township Fruit Purchasing Station either in person or by letter. The township party committee and township government have announced that they will no longer receive any visitors, and this is to inform you accordingly. Signed, Na Sun Chengwen, Manager of Shanghe Township Fruit Purchasing Station."

Why is this notice considered "special"? It turns out that the apples produced in Shanghe Township, located in the eastern mountains of Zou County, are quite famous in the region. Therefore, during the apple harvest season, many higher-level agencies and major business departments come to purchase and order apples. Upon their arrival, the township does not dare to be negligent. Not only do they provide enthusiastic hospitality with cigarettes, alcohol, tea, and meals, but they also arrange for dedicated personnel to handle the purchasing process. The prices are also significantly discounted. After they have eaten and drunk their fill, they take the apples and leave, with all expenses paid by the township. This alone costs the township one to two hundred thousand yuan annually, increasing the financial burden on the township and creating a negative impact among the people.

This year, as the harvest season began, the Shanghe Township Party Committee and Township Government decided to strengthen their anti-corruption efforts. Regardless of which unit, agency, or department comes to purchase apples, they must contact the township fruit purchasing station. No additional money or hospitality will be provided. Thus, the "Special Notice" appeared on the streets.

    “特别告示”
    王代印
    今年八月二十四日，山东邹县尚河乡果品采购站门口贴出一个“特别告示”。告示称：“目前，大批果品即将上市，为满足广大客户需要，敬请来人来函一律与尚河乡果品采购站联系，乡党委、乡政府已声明一律不再接待，特此敬告。尚河乡果品采购站经理孙成文”。
    为什么说这是一个“特别告示”呢？原来，地处邹东山区的尚河乡所产的苹果在远近小有名气，因此，每逢苹果成熟季节，不少上级机关和主要业务部门前来采购定货。他们一来，乡里不敢怠慢，不光要用烟酒茶饭热情招待，还要安排专人负责联络购买，价格也要优惠许多。酒足饭饱，他们拉着苹果走了，一切费用都得乡里拿钱来补。光这项每年要花掉一两万元，乡财政负担加重，在群众中也造成不良影响。
    今年，进入采摘季节后，尚河乡党委、乡政府决定加强廉政建设，不管哪个单位、机关或部门前来购买苹果，都要与乡果品采购站联系，不再补钱和招待。于是，街头便出现了那个“特别告示”。
