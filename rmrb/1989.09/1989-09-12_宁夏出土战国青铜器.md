A batch of exquisite bronze artifacts from the Warring States period were recently unearthed in Xiji County, Guyuan Region, Ningxia. These artifacts include chariot yokes, horse bits, belt buckles, plaques, and short swords, totaling 64 pieces. They were discovered by a farmer from Xinying Township in July while he was collecting soil in the wild and subsequently handed over to the state. Archaeologists have identified these bronze artifacts as cultural relics from the Western Rong people of the Warring States period. The Northern-style bronze culture, characterized by animal motifs, exhibits distinct regional and ethnic features.
