	Paving the Way
	— A Record of a Certain Military Unit Supporting Local Construction

	Fujian is the starting point of the "Maritime Silk Road," but its land roads are far from satisfactory. I recall that when Fujian and Japan first collaborated to produce the "Fujian-Japan" color TV, large containers could not be transported on the winding roads, which led to some ridicule: "Many roads in Fujian still retain the ancient charm of 'a winding path leading to a secluded place'..." Upon hearing this, the soldiers of a certain military unit made a vow that shook the heavens and split the earth: "For the economic takeoff of Fujian, we will pave the way!" After 900 days and nights of hard work, by July 1987, this unit successfully completed the task of constructing the longest bidirectional highway tunnel in the country—the Gu Mountain Highway Tunnel.

	The economic construction of Fujian cannot do without the support of the soldiers. The soldiers' selfless dedication has won the heartfelt support of the people of Fujian. This July, the same military unit moved to Wenjia Wharf in Putian City. Across from the wharf is the hometown of the sea goddess Mazu—Meizhou Island. With the easing of tensions across the strait, more Taiwanese are visiting. Fujian Province decided to build a 300-ton wharf. For more than a month since the start of construction, the soldiers have braved the scorching sun and battled typhoons, working more than 14 hours a day. Water is as precious as oil on the wharf. Local residents turned off their own water taps and directed the water supply to the military's temporary camp. Considering the water difficulties faced by the locals, the military proactively cut off the water pipes and went two kilometers away to fetch water. Upon learning this, 17 female militia members from the village took the shoulder poles from the soldiers and took on the task of delivering water.

	Chairman Deng Xiaoping once signed an order to commend this unit for opening a successful path in supporting local economic construction.

　　开路
　　——解放军某部支援地方建设侧记
    福建是海上“丝绸之路”的起点，可是陆上的路却不尽如人意。记得刚与日本联合生产“福日”彩电之初，因大型集装箱无法在逶迤的小路上运输，曾经引来了人家的好一阵揶揄：“福建的许多道路至今仍保持着‘曲径通幽’的古朴风格……”解放军某部官兵闻讯后，发出了惊天裂石般的誓言：“为八闽的经济腾飞，开路！”经过900个日日夜夜苦战，到1987年7月，这支部队出色地完成了打通全国最长的双向公路隧道——鼓山公路隧道的任务。
    福建的经济建设离不开子弟兵的支持。子弟兵无私奉献，受到福建人民的衷心拥戴。今年7月，解放军某部又转战莆田市文甲码头。码头的对面，是海上女神妈祖的故乡——湄洲岛。随着海峡两岸气氛的缓和，台胞来往增多。福建省决定建设一个300吨级的轮渡码头。开工一个多月来，官兵们顶烈日、战台风，每天施工作业14小时以上。码头上淡水贵如油，当地群众关掉自家的水龙头，把自来水引进部队的临时营房；而部队考虑到当地群众用水困难，主动切断了水管，到两公里外的地方去挑水；村里17名女民兵知道后，夺下战士肩上的扁担，承担起义务送水的任务。
    军委主席邓小平曾签署命令，表彰这支部队为支援地方经济建设开辟了一条成功之路。　（李泉佃　胡立峰　姚根）
