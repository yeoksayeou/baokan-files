The Ministry of Construction is focusing on three key tasks: solving the housing difficulties of urban residents, promoting housing system reforms, and strengthening municipal infrastructure. The Ministry of Construction Minister Lin Hanxiong said on the eve of National Day, "Only when people have a place to live can they work with peace of mind." He emphasized that the Ministry of Construction has set three major goals closely related to improving people's lives: solving the housing difficulties of urban residents, further promoting housing system reforms, and strengthening municipal public utilities infrastructure.

Lin Hanxiong pointed out that currently, one-quarter of urban housing is in short supply, with 2 million households living in conditions of less than 2 square meters per person, and most of these are workers, teachers, and service industry employees. Coupled with the recent marriage and childbearing peaks, the urban population has grown rapidly, with 16 million households needing housing each year. After basic solutions to people's food and clothing needs have been addressed, the housing shortage has become even more pronounced. The Ministry of Construction has established relevant institutions to target and address the housing needs, focusing on reducing construction, especially the construction of office buildings, and prioritizing the construction of housing that people urgently need, with a focus on solving the housing problems of the most difficult households. From the actual situation over the past few years, the main sources of funding for residential construction in China are local governments and enterprises.

The housing system reform, after years of exploration, especially after the deployment of a batch of pilot cities last year, has been increasingly accepted by more residents. At the same time, some new experiences have been accumulated and created. Lin Hanxiong said that the housing reform was proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as early as 1980. Implementing the housing system reform has many advantages: it is conducive to achieving a virtuous cycle of housing funds, revitalizing the real estate industry, adjusting consumption and industrial structures, and solving the housing shortage. However, this minister regretted that the progress of housing reform has been slow in recent years, and people have many complaints about it. He believes that the urgent task at hand is to create a healthy and smooth environment for housing reform, advocate and allow housing commodification, and, on the basis of pilot projects and summarizing experiences, continue to introduce new housing system reform plans.

Strengthening urban municipal public utilities infrastructure has also become a key focus of the Ministry of Construction's current work. Lin Hanxiong proposed several positive suggestions, such as implementing preferential policies for urban infrastructure industries and correcting the distorted price system of public utilities.

    建设部重点抓三件实事
    解决居民住房困难
    推行住房制度改革
  　加强市政基础建设
    据新华社北京9月10日电　（记者徐耀中、李安定）“安居而后才能乐业”，国庆前夕，建设部长林汉雄会见记者时说：“认真地，实实在在作三件同改善人民生活息息相关的实事，已列为建设部当前的工作重点和奋斗的主要目标。这三件实事是：解决城市居民住房困难，进一步推行住房制度改革、加强市政公用基础设施建设。
    林汉雄指出，现在城市缺房占1／4，人均2平方米以下的特别困难户达200万户之多，而且大多数是工人、教师和服务行业职工。加上这几年出现的结婚、生育高峰，城市人口增长过猛，每年又有1600万户需要住房，在基本解决人民温饱之后，住房紧张的矛盾更趋突出。目前建设部已建立相应机构，有目标、有途径地一手抓压缩基建特别是楼堂馆所的压缩，一手抓人民急需的住房建设，重点解决住房特别困难户。从这几年的实际情况看，我国住宅建设的资金主要来自地方和企业。
    住房制度改革经过多年探索，特别是去年全面部署一批试点城市开展之后，已被越来越多的居民所接受。同时也积累和创造了一些新经验。林汉雄说，住房改革是邓小平同志早在1980年就提出来的。实行住房制度改革好处很多：有利于实现住房资金的良性循环，有利于振兴房地产业，有利于调整消费结构和产业结构，有利于解决住房紧张问题等。但是这位部长遗憾地指出，近年来，房改进展缓慢，人民对此颇有怨言。他认为，当务之急要造就一个健康顺利的房改大环境，提倡和允许住房商品化，在试点、总结经验的基础上，继续出台新的住房制度改革方案。
    加强城市市政公用基础设施也已作为建设部当前工作的一个重点。林汉雄提出了一些积极的建议，如对城市基础设施产业实行倾斜政策，改变公用事业价格体系扭曲现象。
