Yunnan is located in the southwestern border region of our motherland and is renowned as the "Kingdom of Plants" and the "Kingdom of Animals." Within the province, there are over 14,000 species of higher plants, accounting for nearly half of the total number in the country. The province is home to 259 species of mammals and 766 species of birds, which make up 55% and 65% of the country's total number of mammals and birds, respectively. Among these, 52 species are listed as protected animals by the state, accounting for 44% of the 104 protected animal species in the country.

To protect these precious animal and plant resources and their habitats, and to conduct comprehensive scientific research for the benefit of humanity, Yunnan began establishing natural reserves starting in 1958. By the end of 1988, the province had established 34 natural reserves covering a total area of 21 million mu. Four of these reserves—Xishuangbanna, Gaoligongshan, Ailao Mountains, and Baima Snow Mountain—have been designated as national-level natural reserves. The 34 natural reserves protect precious plants and animals such as the Hopea, Davidia involucrata, Metasequoia, Cycas, Pinus squamata, Dracaena cambodiana, and Dalbergia odorifera, as well as Asian elephants, wild oxen, saola, Indochinese tigers, Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, musk deer, hornbills, and green peafowls. With the establishment of management organizations, over 150 species of rare and endangered plants and more than 180 species of rare and endangered animals within the natural reserves have been well protected. Some rare animals, such as wild elephants and Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, have begun to reproduce and increase in number.

The rapid development of natural reserves has provided excellent conditions for scientific research and teaching experiments. In recent years, organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Wildlife Fund, and the American Crane Foundation, as well as domestic experts, scholars, and forestry school teachers and students, have continuously visited some of the natural reserves for field studies and internships. The Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has also collaborated with the Baima Snow Mountain Natural Reserve to conduct research on the physiology, ecology, habits, and reproduction of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, which is almost as famous as the giant panda.

    美丽·神奇·丰富
    ——云南的自然保护事业
    云南地处祖国西南边疆，向有“植物王国”、“动物王国”的美称。全省境内，共有高等植物1.4万多种，数量几乎占全国总数的一半；全省有哺乳动物259种，鸟766种，分别占全国兽类、鸟类总数的55％和65％；其中，列入国家保护的动物有52种，占全国104种保护动物的44％。
    为了保护这些珍稀动植物资源及其生存环境，开展综合性的科学研究，造福人类，从1958年起，云南开始建设自然保护区。到1988年底，全省已建成自然保护区34处，总面积2100万亩，列为国家级自然保护区的有西双版纳、高黎贡山、哀牢山、白马雪山4处。34处自然保护区保护的珍稀动植物，有望天树、珙?、秃杉、桫椤、鸡毛松、龙血树、萝芙木以及亚洲象、野牛、羚牛、印支虎、滇金丝猴、鼷鹿、犀鸟、绿孔雀等。随着管理机构的建立，自然保护区境内的150多种珍稀濒危植物和180多种珍稀濒危动物已得到较好保护，有些珍稀动物如野象、滇金丝猴等，已开始繁衍增殖。
    自然保护区的迅速发展，为科学研究和教学实验提供了良好条件。近年来，联合国世界粮农组织、世界野生动物基金会、美国鹤类基金会等组织以及国内专家、学者和林业院校师生，接连不断地来到一些自然保护区考察和实习。中国科学院昆明动物研究所还与白马雪山自然保护区合作，对这里几乎与熊猫齐名的滇金丝猴，进行生理、生态、生活习性和繁衍的考察研究。
