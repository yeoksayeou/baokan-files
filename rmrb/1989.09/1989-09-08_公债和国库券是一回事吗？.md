Are Government Bonds and Treasury Bills the Same Thing?

Question: This year, the state is issuing Treasury Bills while also planning to issue 12 billion yuan in government bonds. Could you please explain the differences between issuing government bonds and Treasury Bills? How should we understand the government bonds issued by the state?

Answer: The state issues government bonds or national debts to meet fiscal needs, to cover fiscal deficits, or to repay old debts. These are known as government bonds or national debts. Government bonds are divided into domestic and foreign debts. Domestic debts refer to loans the state borrows domestically, typically through the issuance of government bonds, Treasury Bills, etc.; foreign debts refer to loans the state borrows from abroad, primarily in the form of foreign loans. Therefore, Treasury Bills are a form of government bonds, and there is no essential difference between government bonds and Treasury Bills; they only differ in name.

However, different types of government bonds or Treasury Bills do have differences in interest rates, repayment methods, issuance methods and targets, and terms.

The government bonds issued on July 1 this year differ from previously issued government bonds or Treasury Bills. Previously issued government bonds were all non-value-preserving bonds, while this year's issue is value-preserving bonds. Value-preserving bonds mean that when the bond matures, the combined principal and interest have the same purchasing power as when the bond was purchased. In other words, the returns received by the bondholder upon redemption should at least match the inflation rate at the time of purchase. This year's value-preserving bonds have a redemption period of 3 years, with an annual interest rate that floats with the 3-year fixed-term savings deposit interest rate set by the People's Bank of China, plus a value-preservation supplement rate, and an additional percentage point.

The repayment method for this year's value-preserving bonds is that upon maturity, the Ministry of Finance will pay the principal and interest in a lump sum. Previously issued Treasury Bills generally involved repaying the principal and interest in several installments. For example, the Treasury Bills issued in 1981 were repaid in five installments from 1986 to 1990.

The issuance of this year's government bonds is allocated to the people's governments of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities with separate plans. Various levels of government organize specialized banks and financial, postal, and other departments to promote the bonds through multiple channels. The issuance targets include urban and rural workers, residents, individual industrial and commercial households, various foundations, insurance companies, and certain companies with the conditions. Previously issued Treasury Bills were generally issued by banks as agents. The issuance targets were generally government agencies, units, the military, public institutions, and wealthy rural towns, as well as urban and rural individuals.

This year's government bonds can be used as collateral for bank loans and can be transferred at designated national locations. Previously issued Treasury Bills were either transferable or non-transferable. For example, Treasury Bills issued before 1984 were not allowed to be traded on the market; however, Treasury Bills issued in 1985, 1986, and 1988 could be traded on the market.

### 公债和国库券是一回事吗？

    公债和国库券是一回事吗？
    问：今年国家在发行国库券的同时，又要发行120亿公债。请问：发行公债与国库券有何区别？如何认识国家发行的公债？

    答：国家为适应财政需要，或为弥补财政赤字，或为归还旧债本息而举借的债，叫做公债或国债。公债分为内债和外债。内债是指国家向国内举借的债，通常以发行公债券、国库券等方式募集；外债是指国家在国外举借的债，基本形式是向国外借款。因此，国库券是公债的一种形式，公债券和国库券无本质区别，只是名称不同而已。
    不过，各种不同的公债券或国库券在利率、还本付息方式、发行方式及对象、期限等方面还是有区别的。
    今年7月1日发行的公债与以往发行的公债或国库券不同。以往发行的公债都是不保值公债，而今年发行的是保值公债。所谓保值公债，就是债券到期时，本息相加后购买力仍相当于购买债券时的购买力。也就是说，购买债券的人在兑付债券后所得到的收益至少要相当于购买债券时的物价上涨幅度。今年发行的保值公债偿还期为3年，年利率随人民银行规定的3年定期储蓄存款利率浮动，加保值贴补率，外加一个百分点。
    今年发行的保值公债的还本付息方式，是债券到期后，由财政部一次付清本息。以往发行的国库券一般是分几次还清本息。如1981年发行的国库券，是自1986年起1990年止分5年作5次还清本息。
    今年保值公债的发行任务分配到各省、自治区、直辖市及计划单列市人民政府，各级政府组织各专业银行和财政、邮政等部门多渠道办理推销工作。发行的对象是城乡职工、居民、个体工商户、各种基金会、保险公司以及有条件的某些公司。以往发行的国库券都是由银行代理发行。发行对象一般是机关团体、部队、事业单位和农村富裕村镇、城乡个人。
    今年发行的公债可以向银行抵押，可以在国家指定的场所转让。以往发行的国库券有的可转让，有的不可转让。如1984年以前发行的国库券，不允许上市转让；而1985年、1986年、1988年发行的国库券可以上市转让。
