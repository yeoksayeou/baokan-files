Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on Vietnam's Unilateral Announcement of Withdrawal
Vietnam Has Not Truly Withdrawn All Troops from Cambodia
Its Basic Scheme to Control Cambodia and Create an Indochina Federation Has Not Changed

BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Reporter Sun Yi: At today's press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Li Zhaoxing made a statement regarding Vietnam's unilateral announcement of withdrawal. The full text is as follows:

Vietnam has mobilized all its propaganda machinery to announce to the world that the last batch of Vietnamese troops occupying Cambodia has completely withdrawn from Cambodia on September 26. If this were true, it would certainly be welcomed by the international community. Unfortunately, the clear facts tell us that Vietnam has not truly withdrawn all its troops.

According to reliable information, Vietnam has at least changed the uniforms of 30,000 soldiers and mixed them into the Heng Samrin army, leaving behind a large amount of weapons and equipment. Vietnam has also deployed a large number of party and government cadres to control the Heng Samrin army and various levels of the Cambodian puppet administrative organs, acting as so-called advisors. Not to mention that among the more than 1 million illegal Vietnamese immigrants in Cambodia, there are still a large number of Vietnamese militia and special agents. It is clear that Vietnam's basic scheme to control Cambodia and create an Indochina Federation has not changed.

At the same time, it must be pointed out that Vietnam's announced withdrawal is unilateral, without strict and effective international supervision and inspection under the auspices of the United Nations, nor is there assistance from Cambodian patriotic military and civilian forces in supervision and inspection. Who can believe such a withdrawal?

The key to solving the Cambodian problem lies in whether Vietnam is truly sincere in ending the aggression and correcting its mistakes. If it is truly sincere, it should unconditionally accept supervision and inspection under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of Cambodian patriotic military and civilian forces. It must be explained here that without the participation of Cambodian patriotic military and civilian forces, it will be very difficult to carry out supervision and inspection. There are more than a dozen major passages and countless minor passages along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. Vietnamese armed forces can easily come out through the major passages and go back in through the minor passages, come out during the day and go back in at night. General supervision measures will not work. Even the Vietnamese mixed into the Heng Samrin puppet army can only be identified by Cambodians. It must also be pointed out that although Nguyen Co Thach, the foreign minister, solemnly declared that the withdrawn Vietnamese troops will not return to Cambodia under any circumstances, the Vietnamese defense ministry spokesperson said on September 19 that Vietnam will send troops to Cambodia again if necessary in the future. It seems that the latter has revealed the truth. In short, Vietnam's unilateral announcement of "complete withdrawal" is not reliable. This has been proven by, and will continue to be proven by, a large amount of facts.

The Chinese government has always advocated a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian problem. The prerequisite is that Vietnam must quickly end the aggression and completely and thoroughly withdraw all its armed forces from Cambodia, without leaving any of its armed personnel in any form, and without returning to Cambodia under any pretext. Only when Vietnam truly withdraws all its troops and establishes a temporary joint government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, can Cambodia have peace and be a truly independent, sovereign, and neutral country. Undoubtedly, this is also beneficial to the surrounding neighboring countries and the Southeast Asian region.

    外交部发言人就越单方面宣布撤军发表谈话
    越南并未真正从柬全部撤军
    其控制柬埔寨搞印支联邦的基本图谋没有改变
    本报北京9月28日讯　记者孙毅报道：中国外交部发言人李肇星在今天的新闻发布会上就越南单方面宣布撤军发表谈话。全文如下：
    越南方面开动所有宣传机器向全世界宣布，越南占领柬埔寨的最后一批军队已于9月26日全部撤出柬埔寨。如果真是这样，当然会受到国际社会的欢迎。但遗憾的是，明明白白的事实告诉人们，越南并未真正全部撤军。
    据可靠消息，越南至少已经将3万名军人换了服装混杂编进韩桑林军队，并留下大量武器装备。越南并配备大批党政骨干控制韩桑林军队和柬伪各级行政机构，充当所谓顾问。更不用说在柬埔寨的100多万越南非法移民中还隐藏着大量越南民兵和特工人员。很清楚，越南控制柬埔寨、搞印支联邦的基本图谋没有改变。
    同时必须指出，越南宣布的撤军是单方面的，既没有联合国主持下的严格、有效的国际监督与核查，也没有柬埔寨爱国军民协助监督与核查，这样的撤军谁能够相信呢？
    解决柬埔寨问题的关键在于越南是否真有诚意结束侵略，改正错误。如果真有诚意，它就应该无条件地接受联合国主持的并有柬埔寨爱国军民参加的监督与核查。这里必须说明，如果没有柬埔寨爱国军民参加，实施监督与核查将是很困难的。越柬边境大的通道有十几条，小的通道无其数。越南武装力量完全可以大道出来、小道再进去，白天出来、晚上再进去，一般性的监督措施是不行的。混编在韩桑林伪军中的越南人也只有柬埔寨人能分得清。还必须指出，尽管阮基石外长冠冕堂皇地宣称撤出的越南军队在任何情况下都不再重返柬埔寨，可是越南国防部发言人9月19日说，今后如有必要，越南仍会再次出兵柬埔寨。看来，后者一语道破了天机。总之，越南单方面宣布的“全部撤军”靠不住。这一点，已经有，并将继续有大量事实来证明。
    中国政府一贯主张全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题。其前提是，越南必须尽快结束侵略，彻底、干净地从柬埔寨撤出一切武装力量，不得以任何形式留下其武装人员，也不得以任何借口重返柬埔寨。只有越南真正全部撤军和建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，柬埔寨才能有和平，才会是一个真正独立、主权和中立的国家。毫无疑问，这对周围邻国和东南亚地区也都是有利的。
