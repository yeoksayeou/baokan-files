The initial efforts of afforestation have shown results after four years. Last year, the total forest area in the province increased by 31 million mu compared to four years ago, the consumption of forest resources decreased by nearly half, and the growth of forest resources remained above 135 million cubic meters.

Guangdong Province has made afforestation a strategic focus for economic development. After four years of effort, the province's barren hills suitable for afforestation have been basically covered with trees. This is a remarkable achievement since Guangdong's reform and opening up.

Guangdong Province has a total of 150 million mu of mountainous land. By the winter of 1985, the province still had over 50 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation. Many places suffered from severe soil erosion, deteriorating ecological environments, frequent natural disasters, and unstable agricultural production. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government formulated a plan in the winter of 1985 to "eliminate barren hills in five years and green Guangdong in ten years." In the spring of 1986, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government proposed to local areas that the county party secretaries, agricultural commission directors, and forestry bureau chiefs should all establish a tree-planting site, personally practice, explore experiences, and lead the masses to do a good job in afforestation. Soon, the Provincial Party Committee decided to establish a target responsibility system for afforestation, clearly stipulating that a forestry inspection should be conducted every year. Those with outstanding achievements in afforestation would be commended and rewarded; those with poor performance in afforestation would be criticized or resign. Provincial Party Secretary Lin Ruohe and the party and government leaders in charge of agriculture led the office staff to establish sites in Conghua, Sanshui, and Zengcheng counties. A total of 517 sites were established by county party secretaries, agricultural commission directors, and forestry bureau chiefs across the province, planting 14.9 million mu of trees and fruits. A total of 11,942 sites were established by various levels and departments, planting 84.6 million mu of trees and fruits. Establishing a good site can drive a large area. According to the Provincial Forestry Bureau, from the winter of 1985 to now, the total area of afforestation and fruit planting in the province has reached 57.8 million mu, including 39.82 million mu of artificial afforestation, 17.98 million mu of aerial seeding, and 45 million mu of closed-hill afforestation.

Guangdong Province also adopted a set of forest protection and management methods, including closed-hill afforestation, controlled logging, and promoting fuel-efficient stoves, effectively consolidating the achievements of afforestation. The province established over 2,700 forest protection stations at the county, township (town), and village levels, and also established a number of forestry dispatch offices to strengthen forestry management. Over 90% of urban residents and brick kilns, lime kilns, and ceramic kilns that use firewood have switched to burning coal or other fuels. Out of the 9.27 million rural households in the province, over 70% have switched to fuel-efficient stoves or reduced firewood usage.

Due to the persistent efforts in afforestation, closed-hill management, protection, and fuel efficiency, the province's forest area has increased from 69 million mu in 1985 to 100 million mu in 1988. The consumption of forest resources has decreased from 15 million cubic meters in 1985 to about 8 million cubic meters last year, while the growth of forest resources has remained above 13.5 million cubic meters in the past two years. The entire forestry production has begun to enter a stage of positive cycle.

### 领导抓种树　南粤添新绿

　　领导抓种树　南粤添新绿
    4年绿化初见成效。去年全省有林地比4年前增加3100万亩，森林资源消耗量比4年前下降近一半，森林资源生长量保持在1350万立方米以上。
    广东省把造林绿化作为经济发展的战略重点来抓。经过4年的努力，全省宜林荒山已基本种上树。这是广东改革开放以来一项令人瞩目的巨大成就。
    广东省共有山地1.5亿亩。到1985年冬统计，全省仍有宜林荒山5000多万亩。不少地方水土流失严重，生态环境恶化，自然灾害频繁，农业生产很不稳定。为此，省委、省政府于1985年冬制订了“5年消灭荒山，10年绿化广东”的计划。1986年春，省委、省政府向各地提出，全省县委书记、农委主任、林业局长都要办好一个造林点，亲自实践，摸索经验，带动群众搞好造林绿化。不久，省委决定建立造林绿化目标责任制，明确规定每年进行一次林业大检查，对造林绿化工作成绩卓著者给予表扬和奖励；造林绿化工作不力者，要受批评或引咎辞职。省委书记林若和分管农业的党政负责同志，以身作责，带领机关干部分别到从化、三水、增城等县抓点。全省各县县委书记、农委主任、林业局长办的点共有517个，造林种果149万多亩，各级各部门办点11942个，造林种果846万亩。办好一个点，带动一大片。据省林业厅统计，自1985年冬到现在，全省造林种果面积共达5780万亩，其中人工造林3982万亩，飞播造林1798万亩，封山育林4500万亩。
    广东省还采取封山育林、控制砍伐和实行改燃节柴等一套保护管理森林的办法，有效地巩固了造林绿化成果。全省建立了县、乡（镇）、村三级护林站2700多个，还建立了一批林业派出所，加强林政管理。城镇居民和以木柴为燃料的砖瓦窑、石灰窑、陶瓷窑已有90％以上改烧煤或其他燃料，全省927万农户已经改燃或改节柴灶的达70％以上。
    由于坚持造林、封山、管护、节柴一起抓，全省有林地已从1985年的6900多万亩增加到1988年的1亿亩，森林资源的消耗量从1985年的1500万立方米，降低到去年的800万立方米左右，而森林资源的生长量近两年来一直保持在1350万立方米以上，整个林业生产开始进入良性循环阶段。　（岑祖谋）
