Grave robbing has become a fashionable trend in the United States. Auction houses across the country are buzzing with the sale of Indian artifacts. A simple clay bowl or a piece of pottery can fetch tens of thousands of dollars, while necklaces, rosaries, and silver crosses can command prices in the millions. Apart from American businessmen, antique dealers and collectors from Western Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia are flocking to these auctions, driving up prices in a frenzy of bidding.

Consequently, more Americans are joining the grave-robbing frenzy. They deploy helicopters, use satellite maps, and employ heavy machinery to dig and search extensively. Once they find something, they immediately put it up for sale. Grave robbers are making a fortune, shamelessly calling their illicit trade a "smokeless industry—grave robbing."

According to official U.S. reports, in recent years, the central and western regions of the United States, from Arizona to North Carolina, have seen vast numbers of modern grave robbers. In just one instance, in the western part of Kentucky, a farm owner named Snack sold a 500-year-old Mississippi village site for a high price. Ten grave robbers, using modern machinery, turned the site upside down. In just two months, all 650 ancient graves were destroyed, and all artifacts were looted.

The Snack incident sparked public outrage. Congress had to pass the Cultural Property Protection Act to prohibit this mad grave-robbing activity. However, these laws are ineffective against the 1979 Federal Cultural Property Protection Act. While the law explicitly prohibits illegal digging of ancient graves on government-owned land and land owned by Native Americans, it also states: "It does not interfere with grave robbing on private land and leased land."

    掘墓业盛行大洋彼岸
    柯谱　宝成
    美国各地拍卖行以拍卖印第安人古董最为时髦。一只泥碗，一片瓦罐，动辄数以万计；至于项圈、念珠、银十字架，更攀上百万高额。除美国商人外，西欧、日本、东南亚等地古董商、收藏家蜂拥而至，争相抬价争购。
    于是许多美国人更投入了掘墓的旋风。他们出动了直升机，使用了卫星地图，调用了重型机械，到处深掘细找。一有所获，立即待价而沽。掘墓人因此大发横财，还恬不知耻地称之为“无烟工业——掘墓业”。
    据美国官方公布的消息，近年来，美国中西部，从亚利桑那到北卡罗莱纳，到处是浩浩荡荡的现代掘墓大军。仅在肯塔基西部的一个名叫斯纳克的农场，场主以高价出让了一处五百年前的密西西比村庄遗址，就有十个掘墓人，用现代机械把这处遗址翻了个底朝天。仅两个月，场地内的六百五十座古墓全被破坏，所有文物，荡然无存。
    斯纳克事件使舆论为之大哗。国会不得不通过文物保护法，禁止这疯狂的挖坟活动。但这些法律都抵不住一九七九年联邦文物保护法。国法虽明文规定，禁止在政府拥有的土地上和印第安人拥有的土地上非法挖掘古墓，但却又说：“不干预在私有土地上和租出的土地上掘墓。”
