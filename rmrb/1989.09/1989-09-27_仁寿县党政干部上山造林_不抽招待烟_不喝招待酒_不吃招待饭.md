Renhou County Party and Government Officials Plant Trees on the Mountains
Do Not Smoke, Drink, or Eat Hosted Cigarettes, Alcohol, or Meals

Our county's non-arable land accounts for approximately one-quarter of the total area. This year, our county was designated as the model county for afforestation and greening in the entire province. To mobilize the entire county to plant trees and afforest, the county committee and county government decided to start this year and continue until 1991, with three months each year focused on concentrated tree planting efforts. The goal is to achieve a forest coverage rate of 20% within three years. During this autumn's tree planting campaign, the county committee and county government dispatched 166 officials to form an afforestation and greening work team to guide tree planting work in the countryside. Each district and township also sent nearly 10,000 officials to the countryside to oversee tree planting work.

The afforestation and greening work team established strict discipline: from the county committee secretary and county magistrate to the staff, everyone brought their own bedding, bowls, and labor tools. After arriving in the countryside, they did not smoke "hosted cigarettes," drink "hosted alcohol," or eat "hosted meals." County committee secretary Yin Zhijun brought his bedding and two coarse bowls to the countryside, visiting all eight townships in Er'e Mountain. He spent 16 days in July participating in tree planting and paid for his own meals. Officials going to the countryside to plant trees showed the farmers the effectiveness of clean governance.

    仁寿县党政干部上山造林
    不抽招待烟　不喝招待酒　不吃招待饭
    我县非耕地面积约占总面积的1／4。今年，我县被定为全省造林绿化的样板县。为动员全县人民植树造林，县委、县政府决定从今年起到1991年，每年3个月集中力量进行植树造林，争取在3年内使全县森林覆盖率达到20％。在今年秋季造林会战中，县委、县政府抽调了166名干部组成造林绿化工作团，下乡指导造林工作，各区乡也派了近万名干部下乡抓造林工作。
    造林绿化工作团规定了严格的纪律：从县委书记、县长到工作人员，全都自带铺盖、碗筷、劳动工具，到农村后不抽“招待烟”，不喝“招待酒”，不吃“招待饭”。县委书记尹志君带着铺盖和两个粗碗下乡，走遍了二峨山的8个乡。他7月份下乡参加造林16天，自付伙食费。干部下乡植树造林，使农民群众看到了廉政建设的实效。
