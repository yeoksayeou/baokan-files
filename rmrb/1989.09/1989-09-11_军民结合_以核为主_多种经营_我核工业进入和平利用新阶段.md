Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th. (Reporters Hu Qiuyun, Correspondent Li Yunhua) The reform and opening up have brought about significant changes in China's nuclear industry structure. The nuclear industry, which previously focused solely on military production, is now developing towards "military-civilian integration, nuclear focus, diversified operations." The civilian product value of the nuclear industry has increased by more than six times in the past decade, with over a thousand types of civilian products developed.

The nuclear power (electricity) industry has seen rapid technological development. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, designed and constructed by China, and the Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, a joint venture between China and foreign countries, are currently making good progress in construction.

Isotope and radiation technology have been widely applied in the national economy and people's lives, and the industry has established a solid foundation in China. There are over 800 types of isotope products, with some projects reaching or approaching world advanced levels.

Nuclear technology and related non-nuclear technologies have achieved results with commercial prospects.

Since its establishment in the mid-1950s, China's nuclear industry has been independent and self-reliant, developing atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and submarine nuclear power systems. It has made historic breakthroughs in the high-tech field of national defense modernization, becoming one of the great achievements since the founding of New China.

　  军民结合　以核为主　多种经营
　　我核工业进入和平利用新阶段
    据新华社北京9月11日电　（记者胡年秋、通讯员李云华）改革开放使中国核工业的产业结构发生了重大变化，过去从事单一军品生产的核工业，正向“军民结合，以核为主，多种经营”的方向发展。核工业的民品产值十年增加了6倍多，民品开发品种达上千个。
    核动力（电）工业技术迅速发展。我国自行设计、建造的秦山核电站和中外合资兴建的广东大亚湾核电站，目前施工取得良好进展。
    同位素与辐射工业技术在国民经济和人民生活中广泛应用，其技术产业在我国已初具规模和基础。同位素制品达800多种，有的项目已接近或达到世界先进水平。
    核科技与非核相关技术取得了具有商业化前景的成果。
    中国核工业从50年代中期创建以来，独立自主、自力更生，研制了原子弹、氢弹和潜艇核动力装置，在为国防现代化服务的高科技领域取得具有历史意义的突破，成为新中国成立以来的巨大成就之一。
