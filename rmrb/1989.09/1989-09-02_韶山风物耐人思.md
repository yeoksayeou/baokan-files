The scenery of Shaoshan invites reflection. “To trace the river’s source to the stars, the scenery of Shaoshan invites reflection.” This is a poem written by Marshal Ye Jianying during his visit to Shaoshan, expressing the feelings of visitors to Shaoshan.

Shaoshan covers an area of over 200 square kilometers with a population of only 100,000. It has gained worldwide attention because Mao Zedong was born here. Since the founding of New China, it has received over 24 million domestic visitors and more than 130,000 international friends from over 130 countries and regions, including more than 60 leaders of our party and state, and more than 10 heads of state.

Anyone who visits Shaoshan will inevitably go to pay tribute to the former residence of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall. They feel a sense of closeness and enlightenment here. Some foreign guests have said: “The Mao family is a family of revolutionaries who completely and thoroughly serve the people,” “Chairman Mao is one of the great figures in the world, a great figure in history.” Last November, Comrade Yang Shangkun specially visited Shaoshan. He said with deep emotion: “Now some people want to deny Chairman Mao, I cannot help but come. Coming here is a gesture, after all, it was under his leadership that we won the country! Comrade Mao Zedong is the principal founder of our party and state, and his historical merits are indelible.” Comrade Hab Xibin wrote in the guest book: “Mao Zedong Thought is the crystallization of the revolutionary will and practice of hundreds of millions of people. It was, is, and will be the guiding ideology for all our work.” Recently, the sixth team of the Beijing June 4th Heroes Reporting Team came to Shaoshan. In the memorial hall, Li Guorui’s comrade-in-arms, Fan Wenfeng, saw that six members of Chairman Mao’s family had sacrificed their lives for the revolution. He said excitedly, “We suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot according to the decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, precisely to defend the People’s Republic, which was won by countless revolutionary forerunners with their blood and lives.” Many workers, youths, and students expressed after the visit that they would forever follow the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The people living and working in Mao Zedong’s hometown all have a sense of honor and responsibility. The people of Shaoshan do not forget the country and do not forget their traditions. The state’s grain procurement tasks are always completed ahead of schedule and in excess; all the mountains are covered in green; social order is well-maintained, and there have never been any foreign-related criminal cases. Currently, Shaoshan is striding towards a socialist new countryside that combines revolutionary memorial sites and tourist areas, and integrates agriculture, industry, and commerce.

### 韶山风物耐人思

    韶山风物耐人思
    “欲溯河源到星宿，韶山风物耐人思。”这是叶剑英元帅在韶山时写的诗句，表达了到韶山参观者的心情。
    韶山方圆二百多平方公里，人口仅十万，她因毛泽东诞生在这里而举世瞩目。新中国成立以来，共接待了国内参观者二千四百多万人，一百三十多个国家和地区的国际友人十三万多人，其中有六十多位我国的党和国家领导人，十多个国家的元首。
    凡到韶山参观的人，都必然要去瞻仰毛泽东同志故居和毛泽东同志纪念馆。他们在这里感到亲切，受到启迪。一些外宾说：“毛主席的家庭是完全彻底为人民服务的革命家庭”，
  “毛主席是世界的伟人之一，是一位历史的伟人。”去年十一月，杨尚昆同志专程访问了韶山，他深情地说：
  “现在有的人想否定毛主席，我不能不来，来了就是一个表示，天下还是他为首打下来的嘛！毛泽东同志是我们党和国家的主要缔造者，他的历史功绩是不可磨灭的。”习仲勋同志在留言簿上写道：“毛泽东思想是亿万人民革命意愿和实践的结晶，它过去是、现在是、将来也是我们一切工作的指导思想。”最近，北京平暴英模报告团第六分团的同志到了韶山。在纪念馆，“共和国卫士”李国瑞的战友樊文峰看到，毛主席一家有六位亲人为革命献出了生命，他激动地说，我们按照党中央、国务院、中央军委的决策平息反革命暴乱，正是为了保卫千千万万革命前辈用鲜血和生命换来的人民共和国。许多工人、青年和学生参观后表示，要永远走毛泽东同志指引的道路。
    在毛泽东故乡生活和工作的人，都有着一种光荣感和责任感。韶山人不忘国家，不忘传统。国家下达的定购粮任务，年年都提前超额完成；群山全都披上了绿装；社会秩序井然，从未发生过一起涉外刑事案件。目前，韶山正朝着革命纪念地和旅游区相结合、农工商综合发展的社会主义新农村迈进。（龚固忠　丰　柯）
