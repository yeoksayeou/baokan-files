	According to a broadcast by the radio station of Democratic Kampuchea on the 8th, while Vietnam announced that it would completely withdraw its invading troops from Cambodia by the end of September, it also sent a new batch of troops to Cambodia at the end of August.

	The broadcast said that on the 28th of August, a convoy of fifty trucks carrying Vietnamese soldiers dressed in the uniforms of the Phnom Penh puppet army, along with twenty heavy artillery pieces, crossed the Vietnam-Cambodia border. They traveled along the No. 2 highway, passing through the city of Takéo, and entered Phnom Penh. On the morning of the 30th of August, this convoy of troops and vehicles left Phnom Penh and headed to the northwestern part of Cambodia, the city of Battambang.
