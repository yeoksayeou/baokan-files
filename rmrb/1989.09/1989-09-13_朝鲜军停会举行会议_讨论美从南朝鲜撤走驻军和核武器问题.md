The Military Armistice Commission of Korea held its 451st meeting today in Panmunjom to discuss easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the withdrawal of U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea.

Due to the United Nations Command's various excuses, today's meeting did not make any progress.

This meeting was convened at the request of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers side of the Military Armistice Commission.

General Choi Yi-hong, the chief delegate of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers side, spoke first, saying that Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement prohibits the introduction and deployment of additional forces from outside Korea. However, the U.S. side recently replaced 48 F-16A fighter-bombers deployed in South Korea with the latest F-16C and F-16D fighter-bombers, all of which are equipped with advanced laser-guided missiles. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has brought more than 1,000 nuclear weapons into South Korea and established nuclear weapon depots in places like Uijeongbu, Gunsan, and Ulsan.

General Choi Yi-hong pointed out that the United Nations Command, as a signatory to the armistice agreement, has a major responsibility to prevent the outbreak of war. However, the U.S. has been unilaterally violating the armistice agreement since June 1957, bringing in large quantities of nuclear weapons into South Korea and conducting large-scale military exercises every year, creating a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. General Choi Yi-hong urged the U.S. to withdraw all nuclear weapons from South Korea to make the peninsula a nuclear-free zone. The United Nations Command, however, claimed that the Military Armistice Commission does not discuss the issue of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.

　　朝鲜军停会举行会议
　　讨论美从南朝鲜撤走驻军和核武器问题
    新华社板门店9月12日电　（记者黎能清）朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在板门店举行第451次会议，讨论缓和朝鲜半岛紧张局势，美国从南朝鲜撤走驻军和核武器问题。
    由于联合国军方面寻找种种借口，致使今天的会议没有取得进展。
    这次会议是应朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面的要求召开的。
    朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员崔义雄少将首先发言说，朝鲜军事停战协定第13款规定，禁止自朝鲜境外运进、增设武力。但是，美国方面最近用最新式的“F—16C”、“F—16D”战斗轰炸机替换了部署在南朝鲜的48架“F—16A”型战斗轰炸机，这些战斗机上都装备着先进的激光导弹。30多年来，美国把1000多枚核武器运进南朝鲜，并在乌山、群山、蔚山等地建立了核武器库。
    崔义雄少将指出，联合国军方面作为停战协定签字一方，有防止战争爆发的重大义务。但是，美国却从1957年6月起单方面违反了停战协定，把大量核武器陆续运进南朝鲜，每年举行大规模的军事演习，造成了朝鲜半岛的紧张局势。崔义雄少将敦促美国从南朝鲜撤走一切核武器使朝鲜半岛成为无核区。联合国军方面则声称，军停会不讨论朝鲜半岛无核区问题。
