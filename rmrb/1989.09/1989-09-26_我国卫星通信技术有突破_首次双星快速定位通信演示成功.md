China successfully completed the functional demonstration test of its first dual-satellite rapid positioning communication system in Beijing today. This success in demonstrating cutting-edge satellite application technology marks a new breakthrough in China's independent development and utilization of satellite communication resources.

In the test room of a certain institute under the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, reporters observed four display screens showing parameters obtained from local and distant ground stations in Xinjiang and Guangxi via satellites. After calculation and processing, the precise geographical locations of these users were displayed in just one second.

It is understood that integrating rapid positioning, communication, and timing to achieve ideal experimental data is a first in the international community.

The test was conducted using two of China's communication satellites positioned at 87.5 degrees and 110.5 degrees east longitude above the equator. The results showed that the system design is correct and reliable, with features such as large capacity, high precision, and relatively low cost. The time synchronization precision can reach the order of billionths of a second, and the rapid positioning precision indicator has reached an advanced international level.

This test was independently designed and developed by China, successfully overcoming technical difficulties such as rapid signal capture and system software for the first time domestically.

Experts told reporters that the rapid positioning communication system established using communication satellites has wide applications in aerospace, navigation, aviation, postal services, mining, transportation, fisheries, disaster relief, and national defense.

Currently, some advanced countries are planning to build rapid positioning communication systems covering regions such as North America and Western Europe.

    我国卫星通信技术有突破
    首次双星快速定位通信演示成功
    新华社北京9月25日电　（记者许志敏、通讯员侯力军）我国首次双星快速定位通信系统功能演示试验今天在北京完成。这项卫星应用尖端技术的演示成功，是我国独立开发利用卫星通信资源的一次新突破。
    在国防科工委某所的试验机房，记者从4个显示屏上看到当地以及远至新疆、广西等地面站点通过卫星测得的参数，经计算处理，仅用一秒钟就显示出这些用户的精确地理位置。
    据了解，将快速定位、通信和定时一体化并获得理想的试验数据，在国际上还是首次。
    这项试验是通过我国定点于赤道上空东经87.5度和110.5度的两颗通信卫星进行的。结果表明：该系统方案设计正确可靠，具有容量大、精度高、成本较低等特点，时间同步精度可达亿分之几秒，快速定位精度指标达到国际先进水平。
      这项试验是依靠我国自己的力量设计研制完成的，在国内首次攻克了信号快速捕获、系统软件等技术难点。
    有关专家告诉记者，利用通信卫星建立的快速定位通信系统在航天、航海、航空、邮电、矿山、运输、渔业、抢险救灾和国防上都有广泛用途。
    目前一些先进国家已在筹建覆盖北美、西欧等区域的快速定位通信系统。
