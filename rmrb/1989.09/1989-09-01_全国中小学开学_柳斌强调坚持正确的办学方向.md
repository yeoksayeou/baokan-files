Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st.

Today, primary and secondary schools across the nation began the new academic year. Liu Bin, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, delivered a speech at the beginning of the new school year through the Educational Television Station to all those engaged in primary and secondary education nationwide.

Liu Bin said that this year's opening of school is different from previous years. After our party and country underwent a serious political struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, reflecting on our educational work, the most fundamental issue is the political direction. For primary and secondary schools, it is necessary to further rectify educational ideology, adhere to the direction of serving socialist modernization, implement the policy of developing morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, and continue to shift primary and secondary education from the "examination-oriented education" track to the track of laying a foundation for comprehensively improving the quality of future citizens. He said that after the opening of school, all primary and secondary schools across the nation should organize primary and secondary school leaders and teachers to study the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. Local schools should conduct education for students to love the Party, love the motherland, and love the People's Liberation Army.

On September 1st, 1.42 million primary and secondary school students in Beijing welcomed the first day of the new academic year. Mayor Chen Xitong and other leaders of Beijing attended the opening ceremony at a school early in the morning, congratulating the new school year. The Beijing Municipal Government requires that starting this year, all schools, government agencies, and enterprises in the city should hoist the national flag on the first day of the new school year to promote the whole society's concern for the education cause and strengthen patriotic education for students.

    全国中小学开学
    柳斌强调坚持正确的办学方向
    据新华社北京9月1日电  今天，全国中小学开始步入新学年。国家教委副主任柳斌在新学年伊始通过教育电视台向全国从事中小学教育工作的同志发表讲话。
    柳斌说，今年的开学不同于往年。在我们党和国家经历了一场制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的严重政治斗争之后，反思我们的教育工作，最根本的一条是政治方向问题。从中小学来说，必须进一步端正教育思想，坚持为社会主义现代化建设服务的办学方向，贯彻德、智、体、美全面发展的方针，继续把中小学教育从“升学教育”的轨道转到为全面提高未来公民素质打好基础的轨道上来。他说，开学后，全国所有中小学都要认真组织中小学领导干部和教师学习邓小平同志的重要讲话和党的十三届四中全会文件。各地学校要对学生进行热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱解放军的教育。（附图片）
    9月1日，北京市142万中小学生迎来了新学年的第一天。陈希同市长同北京市有关领导一早就兴致勃勃地到学校参加开学典礼，祝贺新学年。北京市政府要求，今年起全市学校、机关及企业单位在新学年开学第一天，都要悬挂国旗，以推动全社会关心教育事业，加强对学生的爱国主义教育。图为后孙公园小学校在举行升旗仪式。本报记者　颜世贵文　王景仁摄
