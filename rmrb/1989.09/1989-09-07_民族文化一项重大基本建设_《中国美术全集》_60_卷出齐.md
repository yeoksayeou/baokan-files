A group of experts and scholars recently gathered at the Great Hall of the People to praise the completion of the 60-volume "Complete Collection of Chinese Art" as a significant milestone in the history of national culture and a major basic undertaking.

This collection is monumental in scale, primarily focusing on painting, and includes sculpture, decorative arts, architectural art, calligraphy, and seal engraving. It meticulously selects high-level works recognized by the academic community from the primitive society to the late Qing Dynasty, totaling 15,000 illustrations. It is akin to a treasure trove of ancient art museum.

The publication of this monumental work was undertaken by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, Cultural Relics Publishing House, China Architecture & Building Press, and Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Publishing House. It is reported that the first four publishing houses also collaborated with the Jinxiu Cultural Enterprise in Taiwan to produce the Taiwanese edition of the "Complete Collection of Chinese Art."
