Jose Zinaldo, who was diagnosed by endocrinologists a year ago as having "only half a year to live," miraculously appeared in Brasilia this August. In less than a year, his weight dropped from 302 kilograms (left photo) to 182 kilograms (middle photo), and then to 120 kilograms (right photo). Now, he can not only walk freely but also engage in various sports activities.

Zinaldo developed obesity in 1975. At that time, he was only 21 years old, 1.75 meters tall, and weighed 75 kilograms. In a motorcycle accident, he was mistakenly given the wrong medication by doctors, causing his pituitary gland to malfunction and his metabolism to become unbalanced. As a result, his weight began to increase rapidly, and his appetite grew larger. By July 1988, Zinaldo's weight had reached 302.8 kilograms, earning him the title of "Brazil's Biggest Fat Man." At that time, he could barely move, and due to the heavy burden on his heart, he was constantly short of breath. Doctors believed he was beyond treatment, and he himself thought his "life was nearing its end."

Last autumn, through a friend's introduction, Zinaldo was admitted to a private clinic in São Paulo specializing in the treatment of obesity for a diet therapy. In the first month of his hospitalization, he lost 28 kilograms, and continued to lose weight, gradually recovering his physical functions.

For this obese patient, the biggest challenge in treatment was overcoming "hunger pain." In the past, his appetite was enormous. Every day, he would eat 12 fried eggs, 20 slices of bread, half a kilogram of ham with cheese, and one liter of milk for breakfast. At 10 a.m., he would eat a considerable amount of fruit, biscuits, and sweets. For lunch, he would eat 3 kilograms of meat and 1 kilogram of noodles; for dinner, he would have a lavish meal including 25 chicken legs. If he didn't fill his stomach, his whole body would shake, and his hands and feet would go limp. Doctors calculated that he needed 12,000 calories per day.

During the treatment, he had only two biscuits, a slice of ham, a cup of water, and a cup of milk for breakfast; he did not eat any snacks in the morning. Lunch and dinner consisted mainly of vegetables and beans, with 150 grams of lean meat. When he couldn't bear the hunger at night, the doctor would give him a cup of skim milk to ease his hunger.

Now, his goal is to reduce his weight to 75 kilograms.

    巴西“第一胖人”
    兰才基
    一年前曾被内分泌专家诊断为“只有半年寿命”的“巴西第一胖人”若泽·济纳尔多，今年8月却神奇般地出现在巴西利亚。在不到一年的时间内，他的体重从302公斤（下图左）减到182公斤（下图中），又减到120公斤（下图右），现不仅可以自由行走，而且能从事各种体育活动了。
    济纳尔多是从1975年患上肥胖症的。当时他年仅21岁，身高1.75米，体重75公斤。在一次骑摩托车时，他不慎出了车祸。由于医生用错了药，致使他脑垂体分泌出现紊乱，新陈代谢失去平衡，于是体重日益增加，饮食量越来越大。到1988年7月，济纳尔多的体重竟达到302.8公斤，被称为巴西“第一胖人”。当时，他已寸步难行，由于心脏负担过重，日夜气喘吁吁，医生们认为已无法救治，他自己也以为“生命已快到尽头”。
    去年秋天，济纳尔多通过朋友介绍，住进了圣保罗一家专治肥胖病的私人诊所，进行节食治疗。住院的第一个月，他体重减轻了28公斤，尔后继续减肥，身体的活动机能逐步得到恢复。
    对于这位肥胖病人来说，治病的最大困难莫过于克服“饥饿痛苦”。过去他食量大得惊人，每天的早餐需要吃12个煎鸡蛋、20块面包、半公斤火腿夹奶酪，以及1公升牛奶。上午10点钟还要吃数量可观的水果、饼干和甜点心。午餐要吃3公斤肉和1公斤面条；晚上还需食用包括25个鸡腿在内的丰盛晚餐。如果不塞饱肚子，他就会全身哆嗦，手脚瘫软。医生计算他每日需要1.2万卡路里热量。
    在治疗过程中，他早餐只食两块饼干、一片火腿、一杯水和一杯牛奶；上午不吃点心。午餐和晚餐以吃蔬菜和豆荚为主，加上150克的瘦肉。夜里饿得实在难以忍受的时候，医生就给他一杯脱脂牛奶充饥。
    现在，他的目标是使体重降到75公斤。（附图片）
