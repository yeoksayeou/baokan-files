The St. Lawrence River is one of the cradles of modern civilization in Canada, and nearly one-fifth of Canadians still live along its banks. However, the development of modern industry has brought misfortune to the St. Lawrence River, causing it to be severely polluted. By the time people began to realize this problem, it had already reached a stage where it could not be cured without a significant cost.

At first glance, the river water does not appear particularly turbid, and some sections are quite clear. However, the Quebec provincial government has issued warnings to residents along the river: fish caught from the river should be eaten no more than once a week; pregnant women and nursing mothers should not eat it at all; fish skin and internal organs should not be eaten because toxins are concentrated in these parts. Experts have found that there are over 50,000 chemical substances in the St. Lawrence River water. From the small town of Cornwall downstream for over 200 kilometers, three-quarters of the riverbed sediment has been contaminated by toxic substances. Where do these pollutants come from?

Firstly, industrial sectors dump at least 100,000 tons of toxic waste into the St. Lawrence River each year. Just the paper mills alone discharge 273 tons of wastewater into the river daily. Secondly, every year, 2,900,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 2,100,000 tons of nitrogen oxides are scattered across Quebec province, causing acid rain pollution in the St. Lawrence River. Thirdly, urban sewage and irrigation water from farmlands using chemical fertilizers and pesticides continuously flow into the river. This type of pollution not only directly affects the river water itself but also destroys the soil and ecology of the river basin, thereby harming the living conditions of wild animals. Fourthly, the St. Lawrence River is the only sea route connecting the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, with nearly 10,000 ships passing through each year. The ships carry dangerous substances, and oil spills occur frequently.

Additionally, the rapidly developing tourism industry also contributes to pollution, and so on.

Severe pollution poses a significant threat to the lives and health of residents along the river. Some people have lost trust in the tap water from the St. Lawrence River and prefer to buy mineral water for drinking. Medical experts have found that the incidence of cancer, congenital defects, and toxic diseases along the St. Lawrence River is the highest in Canada. Although relevant government departments deny any direct relationship between this and water pollution, they cannot dispel the psychological shadow in people's minds. According to some experts, five species of marine mammals, 17 species of fish, and 22 species of birds along the river are on the brink of extinction.

Facing this situation, from environmental experts to the general public, calls have been made to save the St. Lawrence River. The federal and provincial governments have taken legal and economic measures to control pollution over the past decade and have achieved initial results. However, overall, the problem is far from solved.

One major obstacle to pollution control is that some people often prioritize economic interests over pollution control. Whether it is the government or the business sector, whenever economic interests conflict with pollution issues, the primary consideration is often economic interests, especially when solving pollution problems requires closing factories and causing unemployment. The government would rather tolerate pollution. Some people sarcastically say that Quebec province has the strictest environmental protection laws in Canada, but they are "not yet in effect," just empty rhetoric. For example, according to the government's fisheries regulations, the government has the right to sue factories that discharge harmful substances to fish survival, but in the past 20 years, out of so many law-breaking factories, only two have been sued, and in the end, they were only fined lightly. Therefore, many people are skeptical of the government's plans to eradicate pollution. Environmental experts believe that unless pollution is stopped, the St. Lawrence River will be doomed, and so will the economy. Pollution destroys not only the environment and the economy but also the human spirit.

### 圣劳伦斯河的厄运

　　圣劳伦斯河的厄运
　　本报记者　郭文福
    圣劳伦斯河是加拿大现代文明的发源地之一，至今仍有近1／5加拿大人生活在它的身旁。但是，现代工业的发展给圣劳伦斯河带来了厄运，使它受到严重污染。而当人们开始认识到这个问题时，它已到了不付出大代价而无法治愈的程度。
    单从表面上看，河水并不十分混浊，有些流段还挺清。但是魁北克省政府已对沿岸居民发出警告：从河里打的鱼，每周最多只能吃一次；孕妇和哺乳期的妇女则完全不能吃；鱼皮和内脏不能吃，因为毒素集中在这些部位。专家们发现，目前圣劳伦斯河水中有5万余种化学物质，从康沃尔小城向下游200多公里河床的沉积物有3／4受了毒物质污染。这些污染物来自何方呢？
    首先，工业部门每年向圣劳伦斯河倾倒至少10万吨的有毒废物，其中仅造纸厂每天就要倾入河中273吨污水。其次，每年有2900多万吨的二氧化硫和2100多万吨的氮氧化合物散落在魁北克省境内，使圣劳伦斯河受到酸雨的污染。第三，城市污水和使用过化学药剂和肥料的农田灌溉用水不断注入河中。这类污染不仅直接影响河水本身，而且也毁坏了沿河流域的土壤和生态，进而损害到野生动物的生存条件。第四，圣劳伦斯河是连接五大湖和大西洋的唯一海上通道，每年有近万条船只驶过。船上装载的有危险的物质，油船泄漏的事故时有发生。
    此外，还有日益发展的旅游业造成的污染，等等。
    严重的污染给沿岸居民的生活和健康造成了很大威胁。有些人对取自圣劳伦斯河的自来水失去了信任，宁愿花钱去买矿泉水饮用。医学专家们发现，圣劳伦斯河沿岸癌的发病率、先天缺陷和中毒性疾病的比例在加拿大是最高的。尽管政府有关部门否认这和河水污染有直接的关系，但无法排除人们心理上的阴影。另据一些专家观察，圣劳伦斯河中已有5种海洋哺乳动物，17种鱼类和河畔的22种鸟濒于灭绝。
    面对这种形势，从环保专家到普遍公众都发出了拯救圣劳伦斯河的呼声。联邦政府和省政府在过去十几年中，采取了一些法律和经济措施治理污染，并取得了初步成果。但总的来看，问题还远远没有解决。
    治理污染的一个主要障碍是一些人往往把经济利益置于治理污染之上。无论是政府还是企业界，每当经济利益和污染问题发生矛盾时，首先考虑的往往是经济利益，尤其是当为了解决污染问题而要关闭工厂、造成失业的情况下，政府宁可容忍污染。有人讽刺说，魁北克省有着全加拿大最严厉的环境保护法律，但是它还“没有生效”，只是空洞的辞藻。比如，根据政府的渔业法令，政府有权对那些排放有害鱼类生存物质的工厂进行起诉，但是在过去的20年中，在那么多违法的工厂中，仅有两家受到起诉，最后也只以轻微的罚款了事。所以，许多人对政府根治污染的计划持怀疑态度。环保专家们认为，除非制止污染，否则圣劳伦斯河完了，经济也完了，污染毁灭的不仅是环境和经济，还有人的精神。
