A high divorce rate is a prominent feature of contemporary French society. In May of this year, an official report indicated that from 1982 to 1988, France's divorce rate rose from 16.8% to 30.8%, with an average of one divorce for every three marriages. In the capital, Paris, this ratio is even higher, reaching one divorce for every marriage, not including couples who simply split without formal divorce proceedings.

The reasons for this situation are multifaceted. People's views on marriage have changed, no longer seeing it as the foundation of the family but rather emphasizing genuine emotions. The definition of genuine emotions varies among individuals. Some believe that emotions are about mutual respect and courtesy, aspiring to the romantic love depicted in novels and longing to return to their parents' moral values. These people are the stabilizing factors in families and marriages. However, this viewpoint is currently in the minority. Others believe that marriage should not be a shackle on emotions. Additionally, with the widespread use of contraception and abortion, people are no longer constrained by childbearing and family relationships. Children are no longer a bond strengthening marital ties. Under the influence of these ideas, the family is seen as a hindrance to "freedom," and French lifestyles have undergone many changes.

Infidelity between spouses is another cause of family breakdowns. Infidelity is quite common in France, accounting for 40% of divorce cases. Over the past decade, the number of unfaithful wives and husbands has doubled and increased by half, respectively.

It is noteworthy that in ten divorce cases, at least seven are initiated by women. The primary reasons are the husband's infidelity, alcoholism, brutality, and lack of concern for the family, followed by emotional incompatibility. In recent years, more and more women have left household chores to join the workforce. They no longer rely on their husbands for a living, their sense of independence has grown, and their demands for family life have increased. After a busy day at work, they neither have the energy nor the willingness to shoulder the burden of household affairs alone, often demanding that their husbands make some sacrifices as well. However, husbands often hesitate to give up their "manly" dignity to play the role of "mom and dad." Some women cannot tolerate this inequality, leading to severe mental suppression and ultimately to separation.

Lack of communication and exchange between spouses is another significant cause of emotional breakdowns. According to surveys, due to work, socializing, and entertainment taking up most of their time, many French couples have only half an hour of genuine conversation per week, aside from routine greetings and trivial chatter. Husbands and wives often treat each other like strangers. Some cannot endure this intentional or unintentional coldness. A psychologist dedicated to "reconciliation" work said, "85% of my 'patients' divorce due to lack of 'communication.' It's hard to imagine that couples can understand each other without talking." He believes that silence between spouses is more frightening than their arguments because arguments at least show that both parties still have something to say and a willingness to mend fences. Silence, however, indicates estrangement, suspicion, and mistrust, signifying that love has faded and the family is facing the prospect of dissolution. Additionally, in France, divorces over trivial matters are not uncommon.

In contrast, the number of cohabiting and temporary partners is increasing, accounting for 37.5% of French adults, and this trend has been accepted by society. There is also the so-called "post-union style," where two people love each other but do not live together. French families present a complex, unstable, and diversified situation.

### 法国：在高离婚率的背后

    法国：在高离婚率的背后
    离婚率高，是法国当前社会生活中的突出现象。今年五月，一份官方报告指出，从一九八二至一九八八年，法国的离婚率由百分之十六点八上升到百分之三十点八，平均每三个婚姻家庭中就有一个是离婚的。在首都巴黎，这一比例甚至高达一比一，其中还不包括同居者自动离散的。
    造成这种状况的原因是多方面的。人们的婚姻观念发生了变化，不再把婚姻作为家庭的基础，而重视真正的感情。所谓真正的感情，不同人有不同的看法。有的人认为，感情就是相互尊重，相敬如宾。他们向往小说中描绘的传奇式爱情，奢望回到父辈的道德观念上去。这些人是家庭和婚姻中的稳定因素。但这种看法目前居下风。另一些人则认为，婚姻不应成为感情的枷锁。此外，由于避孕手段以及堕胎的广泛应用，人们可以不受生育子女和家庭关系的束缚，孩子不再是加强夫妻关系的纽带。在这种观念的冲击下，家庭被看成妨碍“自由”的桎梏，法国人的生活方式发生了诸多变化。
    夫妻间的不忠实，是家庭破裂的另一原因。不忠实的现象在法国相当普遍，百分之四十的离婚案盖由此出。近十年，不忠实的妻子和丈夫分别增加了两倍和一倍。
    值得注意的是，十起离婚案中至少有七起是由妇女主动提出的。理由主要是丈夫不忠、酗酒、粗暴、不关心家庭，其次是感情不合。近年来，越来越多的妇女摆脱家务，参加了工作。她们不再依靠丈夫过日子，独立意识增强了，对家庭生活的要求日渐增高。在繁忙的工作后，她们既无力也不愿再独自挑起家庭事务的重担，往往要求丈夫也做些牺牲，但丈夫多半顾及面子，不愿放下“大男子”的尊威，去扮演“妈妈爸爸”的角色。有的妇女忍受不了这种不平等，精神受到极大压抑，以致发展到分道扬镳的地步。
    夫妻间缺乏对话和交流是感情破裂的又一重要原因。据调查，由于工作、社交、娱乐占去了大部分时间，法国不少夫妇除了一般礼节性的问候和无关紧要的琐谈之外，真正的交谈时间一周只有半小时。夫妻俩视若路人。有的就承受不了这种有意无意的冷淡。一位热心于“破镜重圆”工作的心理专家说：“我的‘患者’有百分之八十五是因为缺少‘对话’离婚的，很难想象夫妻间不交谈而能相互谅解。”他认为，夫妻间的沉默比他们彼此的争吵更可怕，因为争吵至少表示了双方还有话说和有修复前隙的愿望，沉默则意味着隔阂、猜疑和不信任，说明爱心已逝，家庭将面临破裂的厄运。另外，在法国，因区区小事而离婚的也屡见不鲜。
    与此相对应的是，同居和临时结合的人日益增多，已占法国成人的百分之三十七点五，而且得到了社会的承认。此外还有所谓“后结合式”，即两个人相爱却又不住在一起。法国的家庭呈现出一种复杂的不稳定的和多元化的局面。
