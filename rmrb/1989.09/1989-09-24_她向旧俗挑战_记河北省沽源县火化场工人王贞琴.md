With her own hands, she prepares the deceased for viewing, changes their clothes, cremates them, cleans the ashes, and manages the columbarium. She has completed a total of 5,120 cremation tasks. Wang Zhenqin, on this special post, has made contributions to society. The Party and the people have given her high honors, but she has continuously faced challenges from societal norms. Facing these challenges, she has forged her own path.

Fifteen years ago, the news of Wang Zhenqin volunteering to be a female cremation worker spread like wildfire, becoming a sensational topic in the remote mountain village.

The day after she volunteered, relatives and friends filled her house. Some openly mocked her: "Among the 100,000 women in Guyuan County, are you the only capable one? We have bank accounts and enough grain, why do you need to make a name for yourself?" On her first day of work, various forms of criticism came one after another. Some people believed that cremation workers carry bad luck, bringing disaster wherever they go, so people tried to avoid her. The barbershop refused to cut her hair; no one dared to sit next to her in the movie theater. She often heard people whispering behind her back: "She's the one who burns the dead, how disgusting!" These insults and mockeries were like knives stabbing her heart. The most painful thing was that her husband, after hearing many rumors and malicious words, also strongly opposed her, always frowning and not speaking, refusing to eat the food she cooked, and not sharing the same room with her. He even angrily threatened, "If you insist on being a cremation worker, you might as well spend your life with the dead."

Once, her husband fell ill and was bedridden for two days without eating or drinking. Wang Zhenqin stayed by his side day and night, taking care of him. Seeing Zhenqin's frail body and increasingly gaunt face, a complex mix of guilt and regret surged in his heart. He burst into tears, stroking Zhenqin's face and chokingly said, "Zhenqin, I was wrong in the past, I've wronged you..."

Her husband's understanding and change of heart made Wang Zhenqin's eyes well up with tears. Once the misunderstanding was cleared, her husband gave her immense strength, becoming her spiritual pillar.

Cremation workers burn the dead but do the work of the living. Because people are not familiar with the cremation process, there was a rumor that the ashes in the furnace were not cleaned properly, and anyone's ashes could be mixed. To dispel the doubts of the bereaved families, sometimes Wang Zhenqin would, in front of the family members, climb into a furnace that is 2.5 meters deep and 0.7 meters in diameter to clean it. The temperature inside the furnace reaches 40 degrees Celsius, making it hot and unbearable, and the stench is overwhelming. Each time she climbs out, her clothes are soaked with sweat, her body covered in dust, and her nose and eyes filled with ash. To make it convenient for the bereaved families, she built her house in the place farthest from the county seat and closest to the crematorium. Regardless of holidays, weather, day or night, she is always ready to respond. The crematorium has few staff and a heavy workload. Over the past 15 years, she has been the cremation worker, receptionist, custodian, and columbarium manager, never making any extra requests to the crematorium.

Once, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army sent four soldiers who had died in an accident during construction. Due to severe injuries, their bodies were disfigured and covered in blood. At that time, the crematorium did not have a makeup service, but out of her sincere feelings for the soldiers, Wang Zhenqin carefully made up their faces. Soon after, she learned that a migrant worker had died in a car repair shop, and she immediately went to retrieve the body, dressed the naked male corpse, and carried it onto the car. She then opened the furnace and completed the cremation. She didn't finish until 10 o'clock at night. When Wang Zhenqin walked out of the workshop, she felt dizzy and collapsed on the steps, fainting.

On one day in October 1988, a worker from another province died in a car accident in Guyuan. Because it was an unnatural death, the body was brought in and could not be cremated immediately, awaiting the arrival of the family and relevant personnel. However, after 6 or 7 days, no one came. At this time, the body was already rotten and oozing, with the chest and face severely disfigured. To prevent the family from seeing the deceased's miserable state, Wang Zhenqin took the initiative to clean the bloodstains, comb the hair, make up the face, and change the clothes, from underwear to outerwear. The family was so moved that they cried.

In Xiadian Village, Guyuan County, there was a couple who often fought. One day, the wife and her maternal family hastily brought the husband's body to the crematorium, urging her to immediately open the furnace for cremation. Wang Zhenqin noticed their unusual demeanor and incomplete procedures, and thus suspected something was amiss. She immediately reported to the public security bureau. During the 10 days of autopsy and investigation, the body severely rotted and was infested with maggots. Wang Zhenqin used her hands to pick out the maggots and washed the body every day. It turned out that the deceased was poisoned by his wife. Because Wang Zhenqin was diligent and responsible, the culprit was finally caught and sent to prison.

Over the years, the crematorium has had seven different directors and more than 20 staff changes. Apart from half of them being necessary for work adjustments, the rest have found other jobs. Perhaps someone will say, if not for fame, then for money. However, it is unlikely that anyone would become a temporary worker earning 36 yuan per month for 10 years (she only became a contract worker in 1985). Over the years, due to overwork, Wang Zhenqin's weight dropped from 60 kilograms before joining the crematorium to 38 kilograms. She developed severe intestinal tuberculosis, often feeling short of breath, coughing, and nauseous. Doctors and leaders of the crematorium have repeatedly advised her to seek proper treatment. However, since the crematorium has no qualified cremation workers, she keeps postponing it.

Wang Zhenqin has been a cremation worker for 15 years, making selfless contributions to the people and society. She deserves the respect and love of the people.

    她向旧俗挑战
    ——记河北省沽源县火化场工人王贞琴
    纪谷
    用自己的双手，为死者整容、换衣、火化、扫灰膛、管理骨灰堂……总计完成火化任务达5120例。王贞琴在这个特殊的岗位上，为社会作出奉献。党和人民给了她很高的荣誉，然而，她却不断受到世俗的挑战。面对挑战，她踏出了自己的路。
    15年前，王贞琴报名当女火化工的消息不胫而走，在偏远的山村小镇成了爆炸性新闻。
    在她报名的第二天，亲戚朋友挤了一屋。有的当面冷潮热讽：“沽源县妇女10多万，能人难道就数你了？咱们银行有户头，吃粮有余头，你出哪门子风头？”刚一上班，各种打击便接踵而来。有人认为火化工身上带着晦气，走到哪里就会给哪里带来灾难，人们都想法避开她。她常给死者整容，理发店却不愿给她剪发；她常和死者打交道，电影院里没人敢挨着她坐。她常常听到背后有人议论：“她就是烧死人的王贞琴，多恶心！”这些侮辱和奚落像一把把刀子深深刺痛她的心。最使她痛苦的是，丈夫听了许多流言恶语后，也极力反对她，整天阴沉着脸不说话，不吃她做的饭，不与她同室相居，还气愤地威胁说：“你要执意当火化工，就永远和死人打交道去。”
    一次，丈夫生病了，两天卧床不起，滴水未进。王贞琴没明没夜守在丈夫身边精心护理。丈夫看着贞琴单薄的身子，越来越消瘦的脸庞，一股自责、悔恨的复杂情感顿时涌上心头，他热泪夺眶而出，用手抚摸着贞琴的脸，哽咽着说：“贞琴，过去都是我不好，委屈了你……”丈夫的理解和转变，使王贞琴的鼻子一阵发酸。误解一旦消除，丈夫便给了她巨大力量，也成了她精神的支柱。
    火化工烧的是死人，却做着活人的工作。由于人们对火化工序不熟悉，曾流传说，火化场炉膛里打扫不净，谁的骨灰都有。为了打消丧属的疑虑，有时王贞琴要当着丧主的面，钻进深2.5米、内径0.7米的炉膛里清扫，炉温高达40℃，烤热难耐，腥臭难闻。每次钻出来，汗水湿透了衣服，身上堆积着尘土，鼻眼里全是灰。为了方便丧主，她把房盖在了离县城最远、距火化场最近的地方。不论节假日，也不论阴晴雨雪、白天黑夜，她随叫随到。场里人手少，工作量大，15年来，她既是火化工，也是接待员、保管员、骨灰寄存员，从没向场里提出任何额外要求。
    有一次，解放军某部送来4名在施工中牺牲的战士，由于严重外伤而变形，血肉模糊。当时场内没有开展整容业务，凭着对子弟兵的真挚感情，王贞琴精心地为他们整容。不一会儿，又得知一名外流人员病故在车马店时，她又随车前去接尸，并为这具全身一丝不挂的男尸穿好衣服，抬上车，还开炉进行了火化。晚上10点钟才干完活。当王贞琴走出车间时，感到一阵发晕，跌倒在台阶上昏了过去。
    1988年10月的一天，有一位外地工作人员，因车祸死在沽源，因是非正常死亡，尸体拉来后，不能马上火化，需停尸等待家属和有关人员到来。可是，6、7天了不见有人前来。此时，尸体已臭烂、流汤，创伤的胸部、脸部惨不忍睹。为了不使丧属看到死者的惨状，王贞琴便主动为死者清洗血迹、梳理头发、整容、换衣，从内衣换到外套，丧属为之感动得直流泪。
    沽源县下甸村有一对夫妻经常打架。一天，妻子和娘家人把死去的丈夫用车匆匆拉来，慌慌张张让她立即开炉火化。王贞琴见他们神色反常，而且手续又不完备，便产生了怀疑，随即向公安局作了汇报。在验尸和侦破的10天里，尸体严重腐烂生蛆，王贞琴用手把蛆拣掉，每天用水擦洗尸体。结果，证明死者是妻子毒死的。由于王贞琴认真负责，终于使害人者落入法网，锒铛入狱。
    这些年，这个场的场长换了7任，职工换了20多名。除一半是工作需要变动外，其余都另谋它职去了。或许有人会说，不图个名还图个利。图利，恐怕不会有哪个人，去当一个10年每月36元的临时工（她1985年才转为合同工）。这些年由于疲劳过度，王贞琴的体重由入场前的60公斤下降到38公斤。患上了严重的肠结核，常常憋气、咳嗽、恶心。医生和场领导多次劝她好好治疗。但由于场里没有过硬的火化工，她总是一推再推。
    王贞琴干了15年的火化工，为人民、为社会作出了无私的奉献，她理应得到人们的尊重和爱戴。
