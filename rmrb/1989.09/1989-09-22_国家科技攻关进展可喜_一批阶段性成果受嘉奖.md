The 100,000-strong science and technology force responsible for the key national science and technology breakthrough projects during the Seventh Five-Year Plan has achieved a series of phase achievements as the country celebrates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. These achievements have played a supporting and promoting role in the technological progress of China's industry and the establishment of new industries, and have narrowed the gap with the world's advanced levels in some important scientific and technological fields.

Today, the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the Ministry of Finance jointly held a conference to award and commend 210 topics that have made outstanding contributions in the science and technology breakthroughs during the Seventh Five-Year Plan.

The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" science and technology breakthrough plan, with a total investment of 5 billion yuan, arranged for 76 projects. The focus is on traditional industries such as agriculture, energy, transportation, raw materials, and machinery and electricity, as well as the exploration of new fields and the development and localization of major equipment. It is expected that after completion, 80% of the projects will reach the international level of the 1980s.

Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian highly praised the science and technology breakthrough force for their hard work day and night under difficult conditions, dedicating a great deal of effort, and even sacrificing their precious lives. He said that organizing national-level major science and technology breakthroughs is determined by the complexity of economic development and the development of modern science and technology, and is also a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. The completion of the science and technology breakthrough tasks during the Seventh Five-Year Plan is of paramount importance to the implementation of China's economic doubling strategy.

    本报北京九月二十日讯　记者蒋涵箴报道：承担“七五”国家重点科技攻关项目的十万科技大军，在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年之际取得了一批阶段性成果。这批成果对我国工业的技术进步和新兴产业的建立起到了支撑和促进作用，在一些重要科学技术领域里缩短了同世界先进水平的差距。
    今天，国家计委、国家科委、财政部联合召开“七五”国家科技攻关项目阶段成果颁奖发布会，表彰和奖励在科技攻关中作出突出贡献的二百一十个专题。
    总投资为五十亿元的“七五”科技攻关计划共安排了七十六个项目，重点是农业、能源、交通、原材料、机电等传统工业以及新兴领域的开拓，重大装备的研制和国产化。完成之后预计有百分之八十的项目技术水平达到八十年代国际水平。
    国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在会上高度赞扬了科技攻关大军在艰苦的条件下夜以继日地工作，付出了大量心血，有的人甚至献出了宝贵的生命。他说，组织国家级重大科技攻关是经济发展和现代科学技术发展的复杂性所决定的，也是我国社会主义制度优越性的体现。“七五”期间的科学技术攻关任务顺利完成，对执行我国经济实现翻两番具有头等重要的意义。
