This year, the artificial breeding and release of shrimp into the Bohai Sea has made significant progress. A total of 22.34 billion qualified shrimp larvae were released, an increase of 73 percent compared to last year.

The shrimp breeding stations in the Bohai Sea, which were built with national investment, played a key role. The amount they released accounted for 56.2 percent of the total release, and the larvae were of high quality.

The quality of the larvae released by provinces and cities such as Hebei, Liaoning, and Shandong was also generally better than last year.
