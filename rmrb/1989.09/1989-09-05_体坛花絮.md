Half a century ago, at the 10th Olympic Games held in Los Angeles, USA, Liaoning had only Liu Changchun representing China alone. He appeared briefly and returned disappointed. Today, at the 23rd Los Angeles Olympic Games, Liaoning sent 14 young athletes who won 3 gold medals, 1 silver medal, and 2 bronze medals. At the 24th Olympic Games and the 9th and 10th Asian Games, Liaoning athletes also made significant contributions to the country. For this, Liaoning has been awarded the National Sports Commission's Sports Contribution Award for three consecutive years.

Currently, the entire province has 12 athletes who have broken world records 30 times in shooting, model aircraft, parachuting, weightlifting, archery, racewalking, and fin swimming in 10 different events.

    体坛花絮
    半个世纪前，在美国洛杉矶举行的第10届奥运会上，辽宁只有刘长春孑身一人代表中国参赛，稍现即逝，受挫而归。而今，在第23届洛杉矶奥运会上，辽宁有14员小将出征，赢得3枚金牌，1枚银牌和2枚铜牌。在第24届奥运会和第9届、第10届亚运会上，辽宁运动员也都为国家作出了贡献。为此，辽宁连续3年荣获国家体委颁发的体育贡献奖。
    如今全省已有12名运动员30次打破射击、航空模型、跳伞、举重、射箭、竞走、蹼泳等10个项目的世界纪录，有23人49次登上世界冠军的宝座，拥有国际级运动健将29名。
