Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th - The Vietnamese government today issued a statement saying that the last batch of Vietnamese troops occupying Cambodia will withdraw completely from Cambodia between September 21st and 26th.

The statement said that the Vietnamese government had previously announced on April 5th that all Vietnamese troops in Cambodia would be withdrawn by the end of September this year. From May to July this year, Vietnam had already withdrawn 24,000 troops from Cambodia.

The statement revealed that the number of troops to be withdrawn in the final phase is 26,000, including the remaining forces of the 302nd and 330th Infantry Divisions, the 5th Naval Brigade, the 901st Air Force Base Brigade, and various types of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery. These Vietnamese troops will withdraw back to their country by land and sea.

Local observers are skeptical about Vietnam's withdrawal without UN supervision.

According to another report, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told Agence France-Presse on the 6th that once Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia, "we will never return."

Nguyen Co Thach said: "For us, this is a matter of strategic interest. If we do not withdraw our troops, it would mean our own failure, because that would mean Vietnam would be permanently involved in Cambodian affairs."

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 5th - According to a report by the Bangkok Post today, refugees in the largest Cambodian refugee camp in eastern Thailand, Camp 2, expressed skepticism about Vietnam's promise to withdraw completely from Cambodia by the end of this month.

Camp 2 is located in Dapa Ye County, Pattani Province, Thailand. On September 4th, across from the camp in Cambodian territory, the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces engaged in combat with Vietnamese and Heng Samrin's forces.

Ley Kae, a leader of the Sanlo Camp in Camp 2, said that the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces had captured a Vietnamese soldier who had disguised himself as a Cambodian by removing his military uniform and even opened a shop. He believes that many Vietnamese soldiers have transformed themselves into Cambodians in the same way.

    越声称将最后撤军并永不返回
    柬难民对越撤军表示怀疑
    据新华社河内9月5日电　越南政府今天发表一份公报称，最后一批侵柬越军将于9月21日至26日全部撤出柬埔寨。
    公报说，越南政府今年4月5日曾发表把侵柬越军在今年9月底以前全部撤回国内的声明，越南在今年5月至7月期间已从柬埔寨撤出2.4万名军人。
    公报透露，最后一次撤军的人数为2.6万名。其中包括302和330两个步兵师的剩余部队，海军第5团，901空军基地团等以及各类坦克、装甲车、大炮。这些侵柬越军将分别从陆地和海上撤回国。
    此间观察家对越南在没有联合国监督下的撤军持怀疑态度。
    另据报道，越南外长阮基石6日对法新社记者说，一旦越南军队撤出柬埔寨，“我们将永不返回”。
    阮基石说：“对于我们来说，这是一个战略利益问题。如果我们不撤军，就将意味着我们自己失败，因为那样越南就会永久性地卷入柬埔寨事务。”
    据新华社曼谷9月5日电　据《曼谷邮报》今天报道，位于泰国东部边境地区的柬埔寨最大的难民营——2号难民营的难民们对越南关于本月底从柬埔寨全部撤军的保证表示怀疑。
    2号难民营位于泰国巴真府达帕耶县，9月4日，在难民营对面的柬埔寨境内，民柬抵抗力量同越南和韩桑林的军队发生了战斗。
    2号难民营山洛营地的领导人莱凯说，民柬抵抗力量已抓获一名脱下越军军装伪装成柬埔寨人的越南士兵，他甚至还开了一家商店。他认为，许多越南士兵都像这名士兵那样摇身变成柬埔寨人了。
