Deng Xiaoping emphasized this morning that “the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should become the guidelines for resolving international political and economic issues.”

He also expressed his belief that, regardless of the circumstances, “Sino-Japanese friendship will not change and cannot change.”

Deng Xiaoping made these remarks during a meeting with Ito Seisaku, the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union, and the delegation he led.

When discussing the global situation and international relations with the Japanese guests, Deng Xiaoping said that hegemony and bloc politics are no longer viable. He added that not only is it necessary to establish a new international economic order, but also a new international political order. “The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should become the guidelines for resolving international political and economic issues.”

Deng Xiaoping criticized the recent summit of the seven Western countries held in Paris. He said that the resolution on China was based on lies and distorted facts. This resolution is an interference in China’s internal affairs and is unacceptable to China. He described the summit’s handling of the issue as “superficial.”

He told the Japanese guests that the Chinese side had noticed that Japan’s attitude at the summit was different from that of other countries.

Deng Xiaoping said: “China is not afraid of any sanctions. In the end, the sanctions will also harm the sanctioners themselves.”

The meeting lasted for over an hour. The host and guests exchanged views on further developing Sino-Japanese friendship.

Deng Xiaoping said: “Sino-Japanese friendship is very important, both for China and for Japan. Friendship benefits the peoples of both countries and is also beneficial for world peace and development.”

He pointed out: “No matter what changes occur internationally, or what changes occur within Japan and China, Sino-Japanese friendship will not change and cannot change. The friendship between China and Japan will last for generations, which is the wish of everyone.”

Ito Seisaku fully agreed with Deng Xiaoping’s views. He said: “Japan and China should develop friendly relations on the basis of the 1972 statement, that is, on the basis of the one-China principle and the history of an unfortunate period between Japan and China.”

The meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People. At 10 a.m., Ito Seisaku led the delegation to the Great Hall of the People. Deng Xiaoping walked out of Fujian Hall, waving and greeting the gathered Chinese and Japanese reporters while heading towards the guests. He shook hands with Ito Seisaku, saying: “We are old friends. Welcome, welcome.” When the delegation members shook hands with Deng Xiaoping, they all expressed their happiness at seeing him in good health.

Ito Seisaku said to Deng Xiaoping: “It has been a year since we last met, and I am glad to see you in good health. Japanese newspapers reported that you were ill, with various rumors, but the fact is not so.”

Deng Xiaoping said: “Some even said I had passed away or was seriously ill, which caused fluctuations in the Hong Kong financial market. A few days ago, I met with Professor Tsung-Dao Lee. Hong Kong knew about it, and the stock market immediately rebounded.”

“Actually, I have been fine all along,” Deng Xiaoping said with a smile to the Japanese friends present.

During the conversation, Deng Xiaoping praised Ito Seisaku and other members of the delegation as “old friends of the Chinese people who have long been dedicated to Sino-Japanese friendship.” He said: “You came, and I had to see you.”

The president of the China-Japan Friendship Association, Sun Pinghua, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shuxiang, and Japanese Ambassador to China Nakashima Toshitsugu participated in the meeting.

In the afternoon, the delegation led by Ito Seisaku left Beijing and returned to Japan. (Accompanied by a photograph)

　　会见伊东正义一行时
　　邓小平谈国际关系准则
　　强调用和平共处五项原则解决国际政治经济问题
　　指出不论发生什么情况中日友好不能变也不会变
    新华社北京9月19日电　（记者周慈朴）邓小平主席今天上午强调说：
  “和平共处五项原则应该成为解决国际政治问题和国际经济问题的准则。”
    他同时表示相信，不论发生什么情况，“中日友好不能变，也不会变。”
    邓小平是在会见日中友好议员联盟会长伊东正义和由他率领的访华团时说这番话的。
    邓小平在同日本客人谈到世界形势和国际关系问题时说，霸权主义和集团政治已经行不通了。现在不仅要建立国际经济新秩序，而且也要建立国际政治新秩序。“和平共处五项原则应该成为解决国际政治问题和国际经济问题的准则。”
    邓小平批评不久前在巴黎召开的西方七国首脑会议。他说，这个会议关于中国问题的决议是根据一些谎言和歪曲了的事实而作出的。这个决议是对中国内政的干涉，是中国不能接受的。这个会议这样处理问题是“太浅薄了”。
    他告诉日本客人，中国方面注意到日本在会议上态度同其他国家“有所不同”。
    邓小平说：“中国不怕什么制裁。制裁到头来也会使制裁者本身受到损失。”
    会见持续了1个多小时。宾主就进一步发展中日友好问题交换了看法。
    邓小平说：“中日友好十分重要，对中国十分重要，对日本也十分重要。友好对两国人民有利，也对世界和平与发展有利。”
    他指出：“不管国际上有什么变化，也不管日本和中国国内有什么变化，中日友好不能变，也不会变。中日两国世世代代友好下去，是大家的愿望。”
    伊东正义表示完全赞同邓小平主席的看法。他说：“日中两国要在1972年声明的基础上，也就是说要在一个中国原则和日中之间有过一段不幸的历史的基础上来发展友好关系。”
    会见在人民大会堂进行。上午10点，伊东正义率领访华团成员来到人民大会堂。邓小平走出福建厅，一面含笑向聚集在门外的中日记者招手致意，一面迎向客人。他握着伊东正义的手说：“我们是老朋友了，欢迎，欢迎。”访华团的成员在同邓小平握手时都表示，他们看到邓小平那么健康感到很高兴。
    伊东正义对邓小平说：“事隔一年再次相见，看到您身体很健康。日本报纸却说您生病了，有各种各样的谣传，但是事实并非如此。”
    邓小平说：“也有的说我已经去世了或者得了重病，结果引起香港金融市场的波动。几天前，我见了李政道教授。香港知道了，股市马上又回升。”
    “其实我一直都很好，”邓小平笑着向在座的日本朋友们说。
    在交谈中，邓小平称赞伊东正义和访华团其他成员都是“多年来致力于日中友好的中国人民的老朋友”。他说：“你们来了，我不能不见。”
    中日友协会长孙平化，外交部副部长刘述卿，以及日本驻中国大使中岛敏次郎，参加了会见。
    下午，由伊东正义率领的访华团离开北京回国。（附图片）
