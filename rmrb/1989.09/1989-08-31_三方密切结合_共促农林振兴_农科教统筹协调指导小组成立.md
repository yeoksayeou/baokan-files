	According to the strategic guidelines of the Party Central Committee that education and science and technology should serve economic construction and the instructions to strengthen agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Science and Technology Commission, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Forestry, the Agricultural Bank of China, and other departments have conducted discussions and decided to establish the Agricultural Science and Education Coordination and Guidance Group. This group will ensure close collaboration among agriculture, science, and education to jointly promote the development of human resources and technological progress in rural and forest areas.

	In recent years, the relevant departments at both the central and local levels have done a great deal of work in developing rural intellectual resources, promoting scientific and technological progress, and fostering rural economic development. The newly established group proposes the following main tasks for the current stage: First, the provincial and municipal agricultural, scientific, and educational departments should regard the integration of agriculture, science, and education as a major task for revitalizing rural and forest areas, strengthen leadership, and establish corresponding organizations. Second, actively promote the coordinated development of various types of education in rural and forest areas and accelerate the cultivation of various talents in rural areas. Third, the agricultural, scientific, and educational departments should work together to accelerate the promotion and application of practical and new technologies.

    三方密切结合　共促农林振兴
    农科教统筹协调指导小组成立
    本报讯　新华社记者蒲立业、本报记者何加正报道：根据党中央提出的教育科技要为经济建设服务的战略方针和重视加强农业的指示精神，农业部、国家科委、国家教委、林业部、中国农业银行等部门经过酝酿研究，决定成立农科教统筹与协调指导小组，实行农科教三方面密切结合，共同促进农村、林区人才开发与技术进步。
    近几年来，中央和地方的各有关部门在开发农村智力资源、推广科学技术、促进农村经济发展方面各自做了大量工作。新成立的这个小组提出，当前应努力实现以下主要任务：第一，省、地和农科教部门，要把农科教结合作为振兴农村、林区的大事，加强领导，建立相应的组织。第二，积极推进农村以及林区各类教育的协调发展，加快农村各类人才的培养。第三，农科教部门要相互携手，加速实用技术和新技术的推广应用。
