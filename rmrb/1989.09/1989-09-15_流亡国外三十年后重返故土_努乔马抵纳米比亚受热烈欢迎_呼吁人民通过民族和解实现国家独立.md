After thirty years of exile abroad, the leader of the South West Africa People's Organization, Nujoma, returned to Windhoek and was warmly welcomed by thousands of Namibians. He called on the people to achieve national independence through national reconciliation.

Our reporter Li Jingwei reports from Harare on September 15: According to news from Windhoek, the leader of the South West Africa People's Organization, Nujoma, ended his nearly 30-year exile abroad and returned to Windhoek yesterday to participate in the upcoming independence elections. Thousands of Namibian people welcomed Nujoma back to his homeland with the ceremony of welcoming a hero.

Nujoma arrived in Namibia yesterday afternoon on an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Luanda, the capital of Angola. His return marks another important step in the implementation of the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibian independence.

Upon landing at Windhoek Airport, he knelt on the ground and kissed the soil of his motherland. The 60-year-old nationalist leader said, "Returning to the motherland feels very happy."

Nujoma said last night in Windhoek that the mission of the South West Africa People's Organization is to lead Namibia, which has suffered many years of war, to achieve national reconciliation.

In the process of Namibia's independence, the leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization have successively ended their exile abroad and returned to their homeland.

At a press conference held last night, Nujoma said that he and his comrades returned to Namibia with an attitude of peace, friendship, and above all, national reconciliation.

Nujoma called on all Namibian people to achieve national independence through national reconciliation and the implementation of United Nations Resolution 435.

Nujoma said, "Let us start forgetting the sad chapters of history from today and make them the past. We must forever eliminate the painful and long-lasting conflicts, racial hatred, and deep mutual distrust."

He said, "Let us turn over a new page and open a new chapter in history based on national reconciliation of love, peace, human rights, patriotism, mutual respect, and sincerity."

　　流亡国外三十年后重返故土
　　努乔马抵纳米比亚受热烈欢迎
　　呼吁人民通过民族和解实现国家独立
    本报哈拉雷9月15日电　记者李景卫报道：据来自温得和克的消息报道，西南非洲人民组织领导人努乔马结束了在国外近30年的流亡生活，于昨天回到温得和克，参加即将举行的独立选举。数千名纳米比亚人民以欢迎英雄的礼仪，欢迎努乔马返回祖国。
    努乔马是昨天下午乘埃塞俄比亚航空公司班机从安哥拉首都罗安达回到纳米比亚的。他的回国，标志着实施联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的435号决议的进程又迈出重要一步。
    在温得和克机场上，他一下飞机就跪在地上，亲吻了祖国的土地。这位60岁的民族主义领导人说：“回到祖国，感到非常幸福。”
    努乔马昨晚在温得和克说，西南非洲人民组织的使命是领导经过多年战争磨难的纳米比亚实现民族和解。
    在纳米比亚独立进程中，西南非洲人民组织领导人先后结束在国外的流亡生活，回到祖国。
    努乔马在昨晚举行的记者招待会上说，他的同志和他都是以和平、友爱，更重要的是实现民族和解的态度返回纳米比亚的。
    努乔马呼吁全体纳米比亚人民通过民族和解和实施联合国435号决议，使国家获得独立。
    努乔马说：“让我们从今天起忘记令人悲痛的历史章节，使之成为过去。必须永远消除那些痛苦而又长期的冲突、种族仇恨和深深的互不信任的记忆。”
    他说：“让我们翻开新的一页，揭开以友爱、和平、人权、爱国、相互尊重和真诚的民族和解为基础的历史新篇章。”
