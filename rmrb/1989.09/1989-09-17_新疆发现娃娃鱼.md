    Recently, teachers and students from Xinjiang Normal University discovered and collected live specimens of the rare animal, the Xinjiang salamander, in the Alatau Mountains on the western border. This marks the end of the history of this species having no specimens collected in China.

    The Xinjiang salamander is a type of "baby fish," also known as "dragon fish," belonging to the family of small salamanders with tails, and is a first-class protected animal in the country.

    This summer, a herdsman from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps discovered this strange fish in a mountain stream while grazing at high altitudes. Finding it amusing, he took it home and placed it in a fish tank to raise.

　　新疆发现娃娃鱼
    据新华社乌鲁木齐九月十六日电　（记者哈迪尔·马木提）新疆师范大学师生最近在西部边境阿拉套山发现并采集到珍稀动物——新疆北鲵的活标本，结束了我国这一物种无标本收藏的历史。
    新疆北鲵是“娃娃鱼”的一种，也称“龙鱼”，属两栖类有尾小鲵科，是国家一级保护动物。
    今年夏天，新疆生产建设兵团一位牧工在高山放牧时，在山涧小溪发现这种怪鱼，觉得好玩，便拿回家放进鱼缸里喂养。
