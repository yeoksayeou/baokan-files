How to determine the future status of the occupied territories, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, is the key to a comprehensive and just resolution of the Palestinian issue. Recently, Egyptian President Mubarak proposed a 10-point peace plan aimed at narrowing the differences between the Palestinians and Israel, and promoting direct dialogue between the two sides.

At the end of 1987, the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza launched a large-scale uprising against Israel's illegal occupation, fighting for national self-determination. Last July, King Hussein of Jordan announced the severance of Jordan's ties with the West Bank. These two major developments prompted the PLO and Israel to urgently formulate political plans for the future status of the occupied territories. In mid-December last year, PLO Chairman Arafat suggested at the United Nations General Assembly's Geneva meeting on the Palestinian issue that an organizing committee for an international conference on the Middle East be established; that the United Nations deploy international forces in the occupied territories to supervise the withdrawal of Israeli troops and protect Palestinian residents; and that based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, relevant parties participate in the comprehensive resolution of the Middle East problem. Before and after this, the PLO expressed its willingness to engage in direct dialogue with the Israeli side and repeatedly proposed peace initiatives from the Palestinian side regarding the future status of the occupied territories, such as: establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital based on the 1947 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181, and coexisting peacefully with the neighboring state of Israel; the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories under UN supervision, and the UN taking over the administration of the occupied territories; during the half-year to one-year trusteeship period, the occupied territories would hold a civilian vote including East Jerusalem Palestinians, and the elected Palestinian representatives would negotiate other related issues with Israel. It can be seen that the Palestinian side proposed a statehood plan for the final resolution of the Palestinian issue.

The PLO's peace vision and clear stance have received widespread approval from the international community. Although the United States and other Western countries do not support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, they have repeatedly criticized Israel's rigid stance and urged Israel to come up with specific plans. In May of this year, the Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Shamir's election plan for the occupied territories, which included: holding "free elections" in the occupied territories, negotiating with the elected Palestinian representatives, and beginning a five-year period of self-government; in the third year of the self-government period, conducting "permanent settlement" negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis; inviting Egypt and Jordan to participate in the first and second stages of the negotiations to reach a solution acceptable to all parties; and avoiding violence, threats, and terrorist activities in the occupied territories during the entire negotiation and transition period. This plan clearly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state, insists on not negotiating with the PLO, and reiterates that the status of the occupied territories will not change. Its essence lies in avoiding the withdrawal of Israeli troops before the elections, the voting rights of 150,000 residents in East Jerusalem, and the issues of international supervision of the elections and withdrawal. Therefore, Israel's election plan is merely a limited self-government plan for the occupied territories.

Israel's election plan immediately drew criticism from the PLO. The Palestinian side pointed out that it would not agree to any elections that are not linked to the final resolution of the Palestinian issue, emphasizing that the elections must lead to the end of Israel's occupation, the restoration of the Palestinian people's right to return home, self-determination, and the establishment of an independent state. The U.S. side believes that Israel's plan should be "part of the solution to the Palestinian issue." The Soviet side expressed "optimism" about Israel's plan, considering it "some progress," but did not indicate Israel's final stance.

The dispute between the Palestinians and Israel over the future status of the occupied territories is the fundamental reason why the Middle East peace process has not made breakthrough progress. Therefore, Egypt, based on the Palestinian initiative and Israel's plan, proposed a 10-point peace plan. The main contents of the plan include: solving the Palestinian issue in two stages, achieving genuine autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza in the first stage, and finally resolving the Palestinian issue in the second stage; based on the principle of land for peace, directly negotiating between the Palestinians and Israelis to solve the related issues of the first and second stages; agreeing to hold elections in the occupied territories, requiring Arab residents of East Jerusalem to participate in the elections, and temporarily withdrawing Israeli troops from the election areas during the election period, and stopping the plan to expand Jewish settlements. However, Egypt's peace plan did not emphasize the PLO's participation in the preparatory activities before the elections and the subsequent negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. Additionally, Egypt's plan reiterated that the precondition for the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue is the full restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, but did not mention the sensitive issue of establishing a Palestinian state.

After Egypt's plan was proposed, both the Israeli cabinet and the PLO expressed rejection. Shamir reiterated that he would firmly implement Israel's election plan. The PLO side emphasized that Israel should not impose preconditions on the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, and that the PLO would not give up the Palestinian peace initiative, and was prepared to participate in all activities related to the Middle East peace process. However, it seems that both the Palestinians and Israelis have not completely rejected Egypt's plan, and have left room for negotiation. Israeli Defense Minister Rabin flew to Cairo to consult with President Mubarak on related issues, and both sides agreed that the Palestinian delegation and the Israeli government would conduct direct negotiations. On the other hand, PLO Chairman Arafat also made a sudden visit to Egypt. It is believed that the issue of the occupied territories is an important content of the talks between the leaders of the two countries.

In the coming period, how to determine the status of the occupied territories and the related solutions will become the focus of contention among the parties involved in the Middle East peace process. The issue of the occupied territories is like a key that directly affects the opening of the door to Middle East peace.

    解决被占领土地位的三种方案
    朱梦魁
    如何确定包括约旦河西岸和加沙地带在内的被占领土的未来地位，是全面公正解决巴勒斯坦问题的关键。最近，埃及总统穆巴拉克就此提出了10点和平计划，意在缩小巴以之间的分歧，促成双方就此直接对话。
    1987年底，西岸和加沙的巴勒斯坦人民掀起反抗以色列非法占领、争取民族自决的大规模起义浪潮。去年7月，约旦国王侯赛因宣布断绝约旦与西岸的联系。这两项重大的事态发展促使巴解组织和以色列各自紧急酝酿对被占领土未来地位的政治规划。去年12月中旬，巴解组织主席阿拉法特在联大关于巴勒斯坦问题的日内瓦会议上建议组织中东国际会议筹委会；由联合国在被占领土上部署国际部队，监督以色列撤军和保护巴勒斯坦居民；以安理会242号和338号决议为基础，由有关各方参与中东问题的全面解决。在此前后，巴解组织表示愿与以色列方面直接对话，并就被占领土的未来地位多次提出巴勒斯坦方面的和平倡议，诸如：依据联大1947年通过的181号决议，在被占领土上建立以耶路撒冷为首都的独立的巴勒斯坦国，与相邻的以色列国和平共存；以色列军队在联合国监督下全部撤出被占领土，由联合国对被占领土实行托管；在半年至一年的托管期内，被占领土实行包括东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦人参加的公民投票，选举产生的巴勒斯坦代表将与以色列谈判其他有关问题。由此可见，巴勒斯坦方面提出的是一项最终解决巴勒斯坦问题的立国方案。
    巴解组织的和平构想和明确立场得到了国际社会的普遍赞同。美国等西方国家虽然不支持建立独立的巴勒斯坦国的方案，但不断批评以色列的僵硬立场，敦促以色列拿出具体方案。今年5月，以色列内阁通过了沙米尔总理提出的被占领土选举计划，其要点包括：在被占领土实行“自由选举”，以色列与选出的巴勒斯坦代表谈判，并开始为期5年的自治；在自治期的第3年，巴以进行“永久解决”的谈判；邀请埃、约两国参与第一阶段和第二阶段的谈判，以达成各方都能接受的解决办法；在整个谈判和过渡期内，被占领土要“避免暴力、威胁和恐怖行动”。这项计划明确反对建立巴勒斯坦国，坚持不与巴解组织谈判，重申被占领土的地位不发生变动。它的要害在于回避以色列在选举前撤军、东耶路撒冷15万居民的选举权以及由国际监督选举和撤军问题。因此，以色列的选举计划不过是一项被占领土的有限自治方案罢了。
    以色列的选举计划，立即遭到巴解组织的批评。巴勒斯坦方面指出，它不会同意举行任何不与最终解决巴勒斯坦问题挂钩的选举，强调选举必须导致结束以色列的占领，使巴勒斯坦人民重返家园、独立自决和建立独立国家的权利得以彻底恢复。美国方面认为，以色列计划应是“解决巴勒斯坦问题的一部分”。苏联方面对以色列的计划“表示乐观”，认为这是“某种进展”，但尚未表明以色列的最终立场。
    巴以对被占领土未来地位的争议，是中东和平进程难有突破性进展的根本原因。因此，埃及在巴勒斯坦倡议和以色列计划的基础上提出了10点和平计划。计划的主要内容包括：分两阶段解决巴勒斯坦问题，第一阶段实现西岸和加沙的真正自治，第二阶段将最终解决巴勒斯坦问题；根据以土地换取和平的原则，由巴以直接对话来解决第一阶段和第二阶段的有关问题；同意在被占领土上举行选举，要求东耶路撒冷的阿拉伯居民参加选举，在选举期间以色列从选举地区暂行撤军，并停止扩建犹太人定居点的计划。然而，埃及的和平计划没有强调巴解组织参与选举前的筹备活动及此后巴以间的谈判。另外，埃及计划重申了和平解决巴勒斯坦问题的前提应是全面恢复巴勒斯坦人民的合法权利，但并未提及建立巴勒斯坦国这一敏感问题。
    埃及计划提出后，以色列内阁和巴解组织都表示拒绝，沙米尔重申将坚决执行以色列的选举计划。巴解方面强调，以色列不应对巴以对话提出先决条件，巴解将不放弃巴勒斯坦和平倡议，并准备参与与中东和平进程有关的一切活动。但巴以双方似乎对埃及计划又都未全盘否定，且留有余地。以色列国防部长拉宾飞赴开罗与穆巴拉克总统就有关问题展开磋商，双方同意，巴勒斯坦代表团与以色列政府直接进行谈判。另一方面，巴解主席阿拉法特也突访埃及。据认为，被占领土问题是巴埃元首会谈的重要内容之一。
    今后一段时间，如何确定被占领土地位以及有关的解决办法，将成为中东和平有关各方争议的焦点。被占领土问题恰似一把钥匙，它直接关系到中东和平大门开启的迟早。
