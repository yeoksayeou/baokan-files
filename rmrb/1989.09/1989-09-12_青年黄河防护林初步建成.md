The Youth Yellow River Shelterbelt Forest, stretching from Zhongwei County in Ningxia to Dongying City in Shandong, has been under construction for six years and has now completed 90% of the planned tasks. A magnificent and impressive green barrier has initially taken shape along both banks of the Yellow River.

The project was initiated in 1984 by the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the Ministry of Forestry, and the former Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. Over 4.5 million young people and the general public from six provinces and autonomous regions along the Yellow River have planted forests in 4.4 million mu (approximately 293,333 hectares) of contiguous land, constructed agricultural forest networks covering nearly 18 million mu (approximately 1,200,000 hectares), and planted grass over nearly 1 million mu (approximately 66,667 hectares). The entire project is expected to be basically completed by 1990 as originally planned.

    本报讯　从宁夏中卫县到山东东营市的青年黄河防护林工程，历经六载，已完成规划任务的90％，一道宏伟壮观的绿色屏障在黄河两岸初步形成。
    这项工程于1984年由共青团中央、林业部、原水利电力部共同组织施工。沿黄6省区的450万青少年和人民群众，在3000多公里长的黄河两岸成片造林440万亩，建设农田林网近1800万亩，种草近100万亩。整个工程可望按原计划于1990年基本竣工。
