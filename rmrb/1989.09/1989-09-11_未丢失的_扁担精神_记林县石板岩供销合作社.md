In the northwestern part of Lin County in Henan Province, in the Taihang Mountains, there is a grassroots supply and marketing cooperative that gained national fame in the 1960s for its "shoulder pole spirit" – the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative. What is the current situation of this cooperative? Recently, we visited Lin County to find out.

The "Shoulder Pole Spirit" Must Not Be Lost

Shibanyan Township borders Shanxi to the west and Hebei to the north. The entire township has 363 natural villages with a population of over 10,200, more than half of whom live on steep mountain peaks, cliffs, and mid-mountain slopes. In this harsh environment where one has to look up to see the sky and take a step to encounter a mountain, the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative has, for decades, carried and shouldered goods from outside the mountains and delivered them to the people, often climbing mountains and crossing valleys. They have consistently served the mountain farmers, becoming a nationally renowned advanced unit in the 1960s.

Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director Shi Quanchang told us that in the past 30 years, the "shoulder pole spirit" has faced two major challenges.

The first challenge came in 1971. When the first car arrived at the cooperative, the staff thought their shoulders could finally rest. However, the cooperative insisted on a rule that for villages not accessible by car, each person must go up the mountain at least once a month to deliver goods. In recent years, in addition to using cars to deliver goods, the leaders and staff have cumulatively gone up the mountain nearly 8,000 times to deliver goods.

The second challenge came around 1982, when the cooperative implemented a "percentage-based bonus" contract responsibility system. The staff thought that from then on, they only needed to make more money. Some staff initially did not want to go up the mountain to deliver goods and were even less willing to operate small commodities urgently needed by the mountain people. Facing new problems, cooperative director Shi Quanchang and party branch secretary Guo Jinfu actively conducted ideological and political work, making the staff realize that the "shoulder pole spirit" must never be lost.

Willing to Do a Penny's Worth of Business

With the development of the rural commodity economy, some commercial departments have shown a bad tendency of prioritizing money over service quality. Some staff at the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative proposed doing big deals and making big money, paying less attention to small items like needles and threads; some staff even quit their jobs to go to the city to "make money."

Facing this phenomenon, the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative adapted to the changes and expanded its operations. They designated 28 types of small commodities that are urgently needed by the people but have low profits or even incur losses as must-have items for various retail stores and distribution points, checking monthly and penalizing any shortages. They also stipulated that some commodities can be sold in bulk or by the piece, with fertilizers sold in quantities of ten or eight pounds.

Willing to Be the Paving Stone and Bridge for the People

To help the people realize their wish of "living off the mountains, nourishing the mountains, and enriching the mountains," the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative actively supported farmers in developing commodity production. They organized personnel to conduct on-site surveys of over a hundred large and small mountains, formulating a plan of "mountain areas want to get rich, develop fruits, medicines, and trees." They have invested over 400,000 yuan in production support funds, helping the people establish 21 production bases for fruit trees, medicinal materials, silkworm breeding, and fruit processing.

The "shoulder pole spirit" of the Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative is passed down from generation to generation, and the rattles in the hands of the salespeople continue to echo in the deep valleys of the Taihang Mountains.

The Shibanyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative has carried forward the "shoulder pole spirit," worked hard, and served the mountain people for decades. The Party and the people have given them new honors. In recent years, they have been repeatedly commended and awarded by the State Council, the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, and the Ministry of Commerce, and have been consecutively named as "double civilized units" by the city and county for 4 years.

　　未丢失的“扁担精神”
　　——记林县石板岩供销合作社
　　邓文长　傅江　石留根
    在河南林县西北的太行山区，有一个在60年代曾因“一根扁担”精神而闻名全国的基层供销合作社——石板岩供销社。该社近况如何？最近，我们前往林县访问。
    “扁担精神”不能丢
    石板岩乡西临山西，北接河北。全乡363个自然村，有10200多人口，其中半数以上住在险峻的山头、崖顶和半山腰。在这仰头天一绺，抬脚就是山的恶劣环境下，石板岩供销社几十年如一日，每年背扛肩挑从山外运进大批物资，然后，靠一条扁担两只手，翻山越岭送到群众手里，常年坚持为山区农民服务，60年代成为闻名全国的先进单位。
    石板岩供销社主任石泉昌告诉我们，近30年来，“扁担精神”面临两次大的考验。
    第一次在1971年。第一部汽车开进供销社，职工们以为肩膀可以歇歇了。但社里坚持规定，对不通汽车的村庄，每人每月至少一次上山送货。近年来，除用汽车送货外，领导和职工累计上山送货近8000人次。
    第二次冲击在1982年前后，供销社实行“百分计奖”承包责任制，职工们认为今后只要多赚钱就行了。一些职工曾一度不愿上山送货，更不愿经营山区群众急需的小商品。面对新问题，供销社主任石泉昌，党支部书记郭金富积极做思想政治工作，使职工们认识到“扁担精神”啥时也不能丢。
    愿做一分钱的生意
    随着农村商品经济的发展，一些商业部门出现了重金钱轻服务质量的坏作风。石板岩供销社也有部分职工提出要做大买卖，赚大钱，少在针头线脑上作文章；有的职工干脆辞掉工作，到城里
  “捞”钱去了。
      面对这种现象，石板岩供销社以变应变，开拓经营。他们把群众急需但微利甚至赔钱的28种小商品作为各门市部、分销店常年必备的商品。一月一检查，断档就受罚。他们还规定有些商品可拆整卖零，化肥十斤八斤都卖。
    甘当铺路石架桥人石板岩供销社为了帮助群众实现“靠山吃山，吃山养山，养山致富”的愿望，积极扶植农民发展商品生产。他们多次组织人员，走遍了大小百余个山头，进行实地勘查，制定了“山区要想富，发展果、药、树”的方案；先后投放生产扶持金4万多元，帮助群众建立了果树、药材、养蚕、果品加工等21个生产基地。
    石板岩供销社的“扁担精神”代代传，售货员手中的拨浪鼓，也一直回荡在太行山区的深山峡谷之中。
　  石板岩供销社发扬“扁担精神”，艰苦奋斗，数十年如一日为山区群众服务。党和人民给了他们新的荣誉，近年来，他们多次受到国务院、全国供销合作总社、商业部的嘉奖和表彰，并连续4年被市、县评为“双文明单位”。
