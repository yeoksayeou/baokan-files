The Crescent Moon Spring in Dunhuang, renowned worldwide, has regained its former charm after two years of restoration work.

The Crescent Moon Spring is located 5 kilometers south of Dunhuang City. Surrounded by sand dunes formed by wind-blown sand, the spring has remained unburied by sand for thousands of years, making it a marvel of nature. Its unique scenery has attracted countless tourists and poets over the centuries, earning it the title of "the number one spring in the world." During the Cultural Revolution, the spring suffered human-induced damage, and coupled with changes in hydrological and natural factors, it lost its former splendor.

The completed project is the first phase, focusing on dredging and cleaning the spring. After the restoration, the water surface of the Crescent Moon Spring has expanded from 6.9 acres to 13.5 acres; the average water depth has increased from 0.8 meters to 3.5 meters; and the circumference of the spring has been restored from 460 meters to 580 meters. The restoration of the ancient architectural complex around the spring will await the completion of the second phase.

　　敦煌月牙泉重现风采
    本报兰州9月16日电　本报记者张述圣、新华社记者曹永安报道：历时两载的修复，蜚声中外的敦煌月牙泉已重现昔日迷人风采。
    月牙泉位于敦煌市城南5公里处，泉的周围是流沙吹积而成的沙丘，然而在有史记载的数千年中，月牙泉始终未被风沙所掩埋，堪称大自然的一绝。它的奇特景观，古往今来曾吸引了无数游人墨客，留下了“天下第一泉”的美誉。“文化大革命”中，月牙泉遭到人为破坏，加之水文自然诸因素的变迁，使这著名景观失去了昔日风采。
    这次竣工的是一期工程，以疏流淘泉为主。修复后的月牙泉水面由6.9亩恢复为13.5亩；平均水深由0.8米回升到3.5米；泉的周长由460米恢复为580米。至于月牙泉边古建筑群的修复要俟二期工程完成。
