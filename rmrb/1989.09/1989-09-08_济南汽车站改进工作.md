Edition: 6

On May 24, the sixth edition of your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Disorder at Jinan Long-Distance Bus Station," which accurately reflected the problems. We sincerely accept the reader's criticism and have decided to strengthen the sanitation management of the entire station, implement a division of responsibilities, and clarify accountability. We will maintain order at the station by implementing a system where station leaders are on duty. We will also expand and improve the long-distance bus ticket sales points within the city, making it more convenient for passengers to purchase tickets and reducing their waiting time as much as possible. We will work with relevant departments to improve the environment around the station.
