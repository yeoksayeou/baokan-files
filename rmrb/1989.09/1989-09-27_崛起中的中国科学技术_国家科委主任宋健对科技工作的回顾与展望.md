	The Rise of Chinese Science and Technology
	– A Review and Prospect of Science and Technology Work by Song Jian, Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission
	By Jiang Hanxin, Reporter of this Newspaper

	Currently, almost all countries, whether developed or developing, are urgently reviewing the past, planning for the future, and seeking new paths to prosperity. Despite different histories, current situations, and national sentiments, the conclusion is unanimous: progress in science and technology must be relied upon to drive the development of social civilization and the economy. There is no other way.

	In terms of relying on scientific and technological progress, what achievements has China made in the past 40 years? What are the plans for the future? For this, the reporter interviewed Song Jian, Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission. Building a Science and Technology Edifice on a Foundation of Poverty and Backwardness

	Song Jian himself is also a scientist who has worked in defense science and technology. He deeply felt that over the past 40 years, Chinese scientists have made tremendous historical contributions to the progress of the Chinese nation, creating achievements that shine with the times. In 1956, the Party Central Committee issued the call to "March Towards Science," organized experts to formulate China's first long-term scientific and technological development plan, and decided to focus on six key technologies and projects: aerospace technology, atomic energy technology, computing technology, semiconductors, automation, and radio technology. This decision, when fully implemented, laid the foundation for the birth of China's cutting-edge and high technologies, and drove the rise of a series of modern industries and new technology industries, greatly enhancing China's economic, military, and scientific and technological strength. It enabled a poor and backward nation to rise to a position where it can compete with some developed countries.

	In the 1960s, under the leadership of the older generation of scientists, China discovered and established a series of new oil bases such as Daqing, shedding the label of an oil-poor country. Oil production increased from 300,000 tons per year before liberation to 137 million tons in 1988, a 450-fold increase. Since the 1960s, we have independently developed atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, large launch vehicles, and launched a series of scientific and application satellites. Communication satellites developed and launched entirely by our own efforts have reliably served the nation for five consecutive years, transmitting daily television programs and serving the broadcasting and communication industry. China's aerospace technology can compete with the world's advanced levels. This is the result of the Party Central Committee's correct decisions and the concerted efforts of the scientific community, the broad masses of workers, and the People's Liberation Army. These historic achievements are of great significance in enhancing China's international status and driving the development of modern industry.

	Song Jian enthusiastically discussed China's agricultural science and technology achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. He said that now all crop varieties have been updated for several generations. Grain production increased from 110 million tons in 1949 to nearly 400 million tons in 1988, and meat production increased from 2.2 million tons in 1949 to 22 million tons in 1988, ensuring stable food supply for one-fifth of the world's population. This is the great contribution of agricultural science and technology workers to the country and the people. Today, in many fields of agricultural science, especially in the selection and breeding of new varieties and hybrid technology of crops such as rice, wheat, rapeseed, and cotton, China is at the forefront of the world. The "hybrid rice" variety, which won the National Special Invention Award, increases yield by 20% to 30% per mu, and has been promoted to 1.2 billion mu, increasing production by 30 billion kilograms per year. This technology has been transferred to the United States and promoted in more than 20 countries and regions. For this, China and Chinese scientists have been honored with the title of "Father of Hybrid Rice."

	China's 800 million farmers' awakening to science and technology is a major event of global significance. The reporter asked Song Jian for his views on this matter. He said that in socialist China, we must not repeat the old path of capitalist countries in history, where farmers become bankrupt in the process of industrialization and rush to cities in large numbers, suffering in the employment market full of unemployment threats. The rise of township enterprises, which focus on technological development, marks the rebirth of China's rural areas. In 1987, the output value of township enterprises reached 460 billion yuan, surpassing the output value of planting for the first time, with more than 80 million farmers transferring to the industrial sector, achieving "leaving the land but not the village."

	The transformation from the ancient rural natural economy to a socialist commodity economy with science and technology as the pillar is an indispensable condition for China's march towards socialist modernization.

	When discussing the development of science and technology in the 1980s, Song Jian particularly emphasized that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party and government have, for the first time in the history of the Chinese nation, placed the development of science and technology in the primary position of the economic development strategy. This is a great awakening of a nation. Without scientific thinking, we cannot stand tall in the world. Without the progress of science and technology, there will be no high level of socialist material and spiritual civilization. Under this guiding ideology, as soon as we entered the 1980s, the Chinese government established the strategic guiding principle that "economic construction must rely on science and technology, and scientific and technological work must serve economic construction"; it clearly defined that the primary task of scientific and technological work is to revitalize the national economy. Chinese scientists have not let down the expectations of the people across the country. From 1982 to 1987, the total industrial output value increased by 1.04 times (at comparable prices), and the total social output value of rural areas increased by 96%. Such great achievements are inseparable from the development of science and technology.

	On the industrial and transportation fronts, a comprehensive transformation of traditional industries is underway, equipping a large number of enterprises with new technologies and new equipment, and establishing many modern-level industrial and mining enterprises, significantly enhancing China's economic strength. Now, more than 1 million scientists and engineers are implementing the "Spark Program" and the "Harvest Program," which aim to develop local economies.

	He said that in 1987, according to the decision of the Party Central Committee, China began to implement a high-tech research and development plan, organizing elite forces in several of the most important high-tech fields, including biotechnology, space technology, information technology, laser technology, automation technology, energy, and new materials, providing significant investment, aiming to keep up with the world's development trends, and striving to make breakthroughs and progress in these areas.

	Approved by the State Council, in 1988, the "Torch Program" was implemented nationwide, aiming to create a suitable environment for the establishment and development of new and high-tech industries, supporting and encouraging scientists to transform new and high-tech research results into products, and providing new commodities to domestic and international markets.

	Comrade Song Jian emphasized that Chinese scientists must work simultaneously on three levels: directly serving the current economic construction; tracking and developing high technologies; and strengthening the research force on contemporary basic scientific frontiers.

	At the end of the interview, Song Jian said with confidence that today's China is a country with considerable strength. The overall level of Chinese science and technology has far surpassed the general level of developing countries and can compete with developed countries in many fields. Compared to the 1950s, we have the possibility of concentrating more manpower, material resources, and financial resources to develop the cause of science and technology. The Chinese scientific community is full of confidence and must face the challenges in the above three areas.

	History will prove that in the environment of reform and opening up, we can achieve new victories that are worthy of the times in these three areas.

    崛起中的中国科学技术
    ——国家科委主任宋健对科技工作的回顾与展望
    本报记者  蒋涵箴
    当前，几乎所有的国家，不管是发达的还是发展中的国家，都在急切地检讨既往，筹划未来，寻求兴旺发达的新路。尽管各国历史不同，现状和民情各异，结论都是共同的：必须依靠科学技术的进步去推动社会文明和经济的发展，除此，没有别的出路。
    在依靠科技进步方面，40年来中国取得了哪些成就？今后有些什么打算？为此记者访问了国务委员、国家科委主任宋健。在一穷二白地基上建立科技大厦
    宋健本人也是一位科学家，从事过国防科技工作。他深有感触地说：40年来中国的科技工作者为中华民族的进步做出了巨大的历史性贡献，创造了与时代相映益辉的业绩。1956年，党中央发出了“向科学进军”的号召，组织专家制定了我国第一个长期科技发展规划，决定把航天技术，原子能技术、计算技术、半导体、自动化、无线电等6大关键技术和工程作为重点目标。这一决策的全面实施为我国尖端技术和高技术的诞生奠定了基础，并带动了一系列现代工业和新技术产业的崛起，极大地增强了我国经济、军事和科技实力，使一个贫穷落后的民族跃升到能与世界一些发达国家相伯仲论高低的地位。
      60年代，在老一代科学家的带领下，我国发现和建立了大庆等一系列新石油基地，使中国甩掉了贫油国的帽子，石油产量从解放前年产30万吨达到1988年的1.37亿吨，增长了450倍。60年代以来，我们完全依靠自己的力量研制成功了原子弹、氢弹、洲际导弹、大型运载火箭，发射了一系列科研和应用卫星。完全靠我们自己的力量研制和发射的通讯卫星已连续5年忠实可靠地为全国人民传送每日电视节目和为广播通讯事业服务。我国的航天技术能与世界先进水平论高底。这是党中央正确决策的结果，是科技界、广大工人和中国人民解放军同心协力、艰苦奋斗的结果。这些历史性的成就对提高我国国际地位和带动现代工业的发展具有非常重要的意义。八亿农民对科学技术的觉醒
    宋健异常兴奋地谈到了我国农业科学技术所取得的举世瞩目的成就。他说，现在所有的农作物品种已数代更新。粮食产量从1949年的1.1亿吨提高到1988年的近4亿吨，肉类产量从1949年的220万吨提高到1988年的2200万吨，这保证了占世界五分之一的人口稳定的食物供应。这其中蕴涵了农业科学技术工作者为祖国为人民的伟大奉献。今天，在农业科学的很多领域中，特别在水稻、小麦、油菜、棉花等作物的新品种选育和杂交技术方面我国处于世界领先地位。荣获国家特等发明奖的“籼型杂交水稻”新品种，使每亩增产20％到30％，现已推广12亿亩，每年增产300亿公斤。这项技术已转让到美国，在20多个国家和地区推广。为此中国和中国的科学家获得了“杂交水稻之父”的尊称。
    我国8亿农民对科学技术的觉醒是一件具有世界意义的大事，记者请宋健谈谈对这件事的看法。他说，在社会主义的中国绝不能重复历史上资本主义国家的老路，在发展工业化的道路上，让农民破产，大规模地涌进城市，在充满失业威胁的雇佣市场上受煎熬。近几年兴起的以科技开发为主流的乡镇企业标志了中国农村的新生。1987年乡镇企业的产值已达4600亿元，第一次超过种植业的产值，有8000多万农民转移到工业领域，做到了
  “离土不离乡”。
    古老的农村自然经济状态转向以科技为支柱的社会主义商品经济，是中国走向社会主义现代化的不可缺少的条件。在正确方针指导下再上层楼
      当谈到80年代科学技术的发展时，宋健特别强调指出，党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党和政府在中华民族的历史上第一次把发展科学技术提到经济发展战略的首要地位，这是一个民族的伟大觉醒。没有科学思维，我们不可能屹立于世界。没有科学技术的进步，就不会有高度的社会主义物质文明及精神文明。在这一思想指导下，一进入80年代，我国政府就确立了“经济建设必须依靠科学技术，科技工作必须面向经济建设”的战略指导方针；明确了科学技术工作的首要任务是振兴国民经济。中国科技工作者没有辜负全国人民的期望。从1982年到1987年，工业总产值增长了1.04倍（按可比价格），农村社会总产值增长了96％。能取得这么大的成就，这与科学技术的发展是分不开的。
      在工业、交通运输战线上，正在全面改造传统产业，用新技术和新装备武装了大批企业，新建立了许多具有现代化水平的工矿企业，使我国的经济实力大为加强。现在有100多万科技工作者，在实施旨在发展地方经济的“星火计划”、“丰收计划”。
      他说，1987年，按照党中央的决定，我国开始执行一项高技术研究发展计划，在生物工程、空间技术、信息技术、激光技术、自动化技术、能源和新材料等几个最主要的高技术领域，组织精干力量，给予较大的投资，旨在跟踪世界发展潮流，争取在这些方面有所突破，有所前进。
    经国务院批准，1988年在全国范围内开始实施“火炬计划”，其目的是为建立和发展新技术、高技术产业创造适宜的环境条件，支持和鼓励科学家把新技术、高技术研究成果转化为产品，向国内外提供新的商品。
      宋健同志强调，中国的科技工作者必须同时在三个层次上工作：直接为当前的经济建设服务；跟踪和发展高技术；加强对当代基础科学前沿问题的研究力量。
    采访结束时，宋健满怀信心地说，今天的中国已是一个具有相当实力的大国。中国科学技术的整体水平已远远超过发展中国家的一般水平，在许多领域里能与发达国家相比。与50年代相比，我们有可能集中更大的人力、物力和财力发展科学技术事业。中国的科技界充满信心，能够也必须在上述三个方面迎接挑战。
      历史将证明，在改革开放的环境中，我们能够在三个层次上取得无愧于时代的新胜利。
