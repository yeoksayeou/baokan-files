Golden autumn has arrived, and the ginseng sprouts, dressed in green and wearing red caps, have turned the Long White Mountain area red.

Known as the "treasure trove of three-dimensional resources," the Long White Mountain is mysterious and abundant. Over 1,200 species of wild animals and plants, 46 kinds of precious minerals that have been discovered, and abundant water resources are scattered throughout the mountains and underground, making it the largest natural zoo and botanical garden in Asia. The famous Northeast Three Treasures—ginseng, mink fur, and deer antlers—are mainly produced here.

As early as more than two thousand years ago, our ancestors recognized the king of herbs in the Long White Mountain—ginseng. The "Shennong Bencao Jing" states, "It mainly nourishes the five viscera, calms the spirit, stabilizes the soul... Long-term consumption can lighten the body and prolong life." During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, officials were dispatched to the Long White Mountain area to search for treasures and discovered that the ginseng here was of superior quality and beneficial to the people's longevity. Kangxi then ordered the Long White Mountain to be "permanently sealed off," with ginseng being "exclusively harvested by the imperial court, offered to princes and nobles, rewarded to high-ranking officials, and gifted to foreign envoys," for over 200 years. Hence, it is named "Imperial Seal Ginseng."

The times have changed, and the heroes of today are different. With the forward march of the People's Republic, the treasures of longevity and health that the Changbai Mountain area in Jilin Province offers to humanity are increasing day by day: In the early days of the founding of New China, the area of ginseng cultivation was only over 200 hectares, and the cultivation methods were still primitive and backward, with annual production being minimal. Processing was also relatively simple, with only red ginseng and white dried ginseng. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the deepening of rural reforms, ginseng production became a key project in the development of the Changbai Mountain area. The area of cultivation and the production of fresh ginseng increased by tens of times. The total output accounts for 80% of the national total, the export volume accounts for 70% of the national total, and the trade volume accounts for 40% of the world's total. Experts in our province have used modern scientific knowledge and methods to conduct extensive research and exploration on ginseng, successively developing new products such as Xin Kaifeng Ginseng, Changbai Mountain Red Ginseng, and Imperial Seal Ginseng. Nutritional foods and cosmetics made from ginseng as raw materials are continuously launched, reaching dozens of varieties. "Changbai Mountain Red Ginseng" won the first gold medal in the history of ginseng at the 36th Eureka World Expo. Subsequently, "Imperial Seal Ginseng," with its effective ingredients significantly higher than domestic and foreign similar products, won the gold medal at the Beijing International Invention Expo. The wish written by Mr. Pu Jie, "May Imperial Seal Ginseng go to the world," has become a reality.

    参籽映红长白山
    葛中和
    金秋来了，人参娃娃身着绿装，头顶红帽，映红了长白山区。
    素有“立体资源宝库”之称的长白山，神奇而富饶。1200多种野生动植物，已探明的46种珍贵矿藏以及丰富的水资源，遍布山中地下，堪称亚洲最大的天然动植物园。闻名海内外的东北三宝——人参、貂皮、鹿茸角主产在这里。
    早在两千多年前，我们的祖先对长白山中的百草之王——人参，就有所认识，《神农本草经》谓之“主补五脏，安精神，定魂魄……久服则轻身延年。”清康熙年间，曾派大臣到长白山区寻珍索宝，发现此地人参品优质佳，抚民长寿。康熙遂下令对长白山“永行封禁”，人参由“皇室独采，贡王公贵族，赏功高将领，礼臣服外藩”，达200多年。由此而得名“皇封参”。
    数风流人物还看今朝。随着共和国前进的脚步，吉林长白山区奉献给人类的强身增寿之宝与日俱增：新中国建立初期，人参栽植面积仅200多公顷，栽培方式也是沿用原始落后的办法，年产量微乎其微；加工也比较简单，只有红参和白干参两种。党的十一届三中全会以后，随着农村改革的深入，人参生产列入长白山区开发的骨干项目，栽植面积和鲜参产量增加了几十倍。总产量占全国的80％，出口量占全国的70％，贸易量占世界的40％。我省人参专家们，运用现代科学知识和方法对人参进行了大量研究探索，先后开拓出新开河参、长白山红参、皇封参等新产品，以人参为原料的营养食品和化妆品不断推出，达几十个品种。“长白山红参”，在第36届尤里卡世界博览会上一举夺魁，摘取了世界人参史上的第一块金牌。继而，“皇封参”以有效成份十分明显地高于国内外同类产品的先进水平，荣获北京国际发明展览会金牌奖。溥杰先生题写的“祝皇封参走向世界”的祝愿，变成了现实。
