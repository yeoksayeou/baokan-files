The Ministry of Supervision today released the "Implementation Details for the Interim Regulations on Administrative Sanctions for Bribery and Embezzlement by State Administrative Personnel," which consists of forty-six articles and is nearly six thousand characters long.

This implementation detail has been approved by the State Council.

The detail is formulated based on the Interim Regulations on Administrative Sanctions for Bribery and Embezzlement by State Administrative Personnel.

The detail clarifies that "utilizing the convenience of one's position" includes both utilizing the authority within one's own job scope and utilizing the convenient conditions formed by one's current or previous job position. It stipulates that if a state administrative personnel's assets or expenditures are obviously beyond their legal income and they cannot explain the legal source, with a discrepancy of more than 2,000 yuan, or if they conceal overseas deposits amounting to less than 5,000 yuan, administrative sanctions will be imposed based on the circumstances. Additionally, for bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and shielding of bribery and embezzlement behaviors, clear quantitative standards for penalties are also specified according to the amount or circumstances.

This implementation detail will be implemented simultaneously with the Interim Regulations on Administrative Sanctions for Bribery and Embezzlement by State Administrative Personnel.
