    Cities will play an increasingly important role in absorbing the majority of the world's population. More and more countries will become urban rather than rural.

    There have been significant changes in the distribution of urban populations in many parts of the world. At the beginning of this century, cities with populations exceeding 100,000 were found only in Europe. By the 1950s, Europe had fallen behind Asia and the Americas. By the year 2000, Asia will dominate the global urban landscape, with 45% of the world's urban population residing there. The fastest urbanization will occur in African countries.

    Large cities (with populations exceeding 1 million), megacities (with populations exceeding 2 million), and supercities (with populations exceeding 5 million) will continue to expand. In 1950, the global urban population was 3.9 billion, with 45.1% living in cities with populations exceeding 1 million. By the year 2000, the global urban population is expected to reach 2.2 billion, with 63% living in cities with populations exceeding 1 million.

    Although urbanization is developing rapidly, many countries still have large rural populations, and a significant portion of the urban population still resides in towns with fewer than 100,000 people.

    世界都市化趋势
    城市在吸收世界大部分人口中将发挥日益重要的作用。愈来愈多的国家将成为以城市为主而不是以农村为主的国家。
    世界广大地区城市人口的分布发生了巨大变化。本世纪初，世界人口超过十万的城市只出现在欧洲，而到五十年代，欧洲已落后于亚洲与美洲。到2000年，亚洲将主导世界都市化的画面，45％的世界城市人口将出现在这里。都市化水平提高最快的将是非洲国家。
    大城市（人口超过100万）、特大城市（人口超过200万）、超大城市（人口超过500万），将有进一步扩大的趋势，1950年，世界城市人口为3.9亿，其中45.1％居住在超过100万人口的城市，到2000年世界城市人口预计为22亿，其中将有63％居住在超过100万人口的城市。
    虽然都市化发展迅速，许多国家仍有巨大的农村人口，而城市人口也有很大一部分仍居住在不到10万人口的城镇中。
