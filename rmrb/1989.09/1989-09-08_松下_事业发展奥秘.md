Panasonic's founder, Konosuke Matsushita, spent his childhood in poverty and poor health. Despite these challenges, he lived to the age of ninety-four, passing away this April. With only a primary school education, he became self-taught and eventually one of Japan's wealthiest individuals. Starting from scratch, he founded Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which today is one of the world's leading electronics enterprises. His outstanding managerial skills have made him a representative of Japanese-style management among renowned global business leaders.

Matsushita started working as an apprentice and a laborer at a young age. However, he was never content with his situation and always sought to expand his business. Shortly after getting married, he and his wife, Hanayo, along with his brother-in-law, Seizaburo Tsuzuki, decided to establish Matsushita Electric Device Manufacturing Works. They started with a mere 100 yen, a paltry sum! Initially, they took on a contract to produce electric fan bases, and later used lamp socket metal to make connector plugs, which were 30% cheaper than market prices, making a significant impact and laying the foundation for Matsushita Company. Soon after, they produced the first bicycle lamps, which sold nationwide. By the 1930s, Matsushita's production expanded into the radio field, and they began researching television picture tubes and video equipment. In 1952, they collaborated with the Dutch company Philips to establish Matsushita Electronics Corporation. In the 1960s, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Group was formed, becoming a global enterprise.

Today, Matsushita Company is renowned worldwide for its television and video equipment, which account for 30% of its total sales. However, the new leadership is increasingly focused on product diversification and internationalization. Currently, this electronics giant generates annual sales of $42 billion, ranking third in Japan, behind Toyota and Hitachi, and is among the world's top 50 companies.

Matsushita's business success is closely tied to the management theories and practices of Konosuke Matsushita and his successors. His book, "Philosophy of Management" (1975), systematically summarizes Matsushita's management and operational experiences. He emphasizes the importance of "listening to practice," reminding everyone that "the customer is king," and that consumer feedback should be treated as a "whip of love." He also stresses that "quality is the market," advocating for the provision of affordable, high-quality products to society. He believes that "a 1% defect rate means a 100% defect for the customer who encounters it." Upon receiving any defect information, he would immediately order a halt to production, identify the cause, and rectify it promptly. In handling internal company issues, he paid attention to coordinating the relationship between the union and management, ensuring that all employees work diligently and share in the results.

Matsushita and his successors also emphasized the integration of production and sales in their business operations. Matsushita himself systematically summarized a set of business tactics known as the "Matsushita Business Method." Many of its principles focus on the passion and respect for customers, with the slogan "Customers are friends!" He believed that credit is paramount, stating, "Poor credit is the most worrying thing," and advocated for "earning reputation and praise."

Of course, all these principles ultimately aim to achieve greater profits.

Matsushita placed great importance on talent development. He established a training center at the Osaka headquarters to provide systematic training for new and existing employees, as well as overseas staff. In addition to the central research institute in Osaka, he built 36 affiliated laboratories and 6 overseas research institutes. He recruited and trained over 22,000 researchers and engineers, resulting in Matsushita Company producing and holding patents for 55,000 products. To cultivate high-level political and economic talent, he also founded the Matsushita Political Academy, which covers all tuition fees for students. The five-year program has already seen two graduating classes. Some graduates have engaged in political activities and been elected as legislators, while others have entered the financial sector and become company presidents. Applicants for the academy must be university graduates under the age of 26 and must pass three rigorous examinations to be admitted. Due to his emphasis on education and talent development, Matsushita's business has continued to thrive.

    “松下”事业发展奥秘
    施展
    松下幸之助的少儿时代，一直被贫困与病弱缠扰着。然而，他竟能活到九十四岁高龄，于今年四月辞世。他只上完小学，但自学成才，早已成为日本国的一位巨富。他白手起家创建的松下电气产业公司，今天已是世界上屈指可数的大型电器企业。他的卓越经营才能，使自己变成了世界著名企业家中日本式经营的代表人物。
    松下很小就当学徒和小工。但是他不安于现状，总想开拓一番事业。他婚后不久，与妻子梅野和内弟植岁男合计，三人创建松下电器制作所。当时只有一百日元的本钱，少得可怜！先是承包生产一批电风扇的底盘，后利用电灯口金属制成连接插头，比市场价格便宜百分之三十，一炮打响，奠定了松下公司的基础。不久，首次制成自行车灯，产品行销全国。到了三十年代，松下的生产业务扩展到收音机领域，并开始研制电视显像管以及录像器材。一九五二年，与荷兰菲利浦公司进行技术合作，成立了松下电子工业公司。六十年代，松下电器产业集团诞生，成为世界性大企业。
    目前的松下公司，仍以它最占优势的电视和录相器材蜚声世界，产品占其总销量的百分之三十。不过，新的当权者已以锐利目光日益注重产品的多元化和国际化了。今天，松下这一电器巨擘每年销售四百二十亿美元，在国内仅次于丰田公司和日立公司，居第三位，并且已跻身世界五十家大企业行列。
    松下事业能够不断发展，与松下幸之助及其后继人的经营理论和实践分不开。他的《对人的思考》（一九七五年）等著作，系统地总结了松下的经营管理经验。他提醒大家一定要“倾听实践”，要记住“用户即帝王”，要把消费者的声音当作“爱护之鞭”。他还强调“质量即市场”，要“尽可能以廉价且品质优良的制品，提供社会”。他认为：“百分之一的次品，对于某一用户来说就是百分之百的次品。”他一得到次品信息，便命令停工，查出原因，迅即纠正。在处理公司内部问题方面，他注意协调工会与经营者的关系，让所有员工都能努力工作，并分享一定的成果。
    松下先生和他的继承人在经营企业时，还重视将生产和销售紧密结合起来。他本人就曾系统总结了一套经商战术，称为“松下商法”。其中很多条文都是讲对顾客的热情与尊重，口号是
  “顾客皆亲友！”他认为信用最要紧，“信用不佳最可忧”，要
  “赢得信誉与称赞”。
    当然，百条千条，归根一条，其目的无非是为了赚取更大的利润。
    松下先生很重视培训人才的工作。他在大阪总公司设置了培训中心，对新职工、在职职工进行有计划培训，对海外职工也注意培训，除大阪的中央研究所外，还兴建了直属的三十六个实验室，海外则设有六个研究所。招聘和培养了研究员和工程师二万二千多名，结果，松下公司生产和持有专利权的产品达五万五千项。为了培养高级政治、经济人才，他还创办了松下政治塾，学生学习费用全由学校负担，五年制，已有两届毕业生。他们中有从事政治活动，当选议员的；有进入财界，当上公司总经理的。参加入学考试的，必须是不满二十六岁的大学毕业生。须经三次严格考试合格才准入学。由于注重教育，培养了大批人才，松下的事业不断发展。（附图片）
