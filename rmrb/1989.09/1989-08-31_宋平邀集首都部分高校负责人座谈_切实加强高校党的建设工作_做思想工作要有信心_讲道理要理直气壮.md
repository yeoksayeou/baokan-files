Recently, Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the head of the Organization Department, presided over a meeting with the party secretaries and presidents of some universities in the capital. The attendees discussed how to strengthen party building in universities and offered many good opinions and suggestions.

The attendees believed that to strengthen party building in universities, one must first fully recognize the severe situation facing university party building in recent years. Wang Xuezhen, the party secretary of Peking University, said that one should not underestimate the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization into the party ranks, nor should one underestimate the impact of the turmoil and counterrevolutionary riots on university party building work, nor should one underestimate the adverse effects caused by Zhao Ziyang's downplaying of party leadership and party work. Fang Fukan, the president of Beijing Normal University, said that one should also fully recognize the influence of foreign hostile forces. Our university had a case of Wu'erkaixi and Liu Xiaobo. Wu'erkaixi used to stutter when speaking in public and failed three courses. Later, a person from a foreign radio station specially trained him, teaching him how to answer questions about failing three courses, when to pause, when to raise his voice, and when to wait for applause, etc. He quickly learned all these tricks and also learned to lie and play double games.

Many attendees proposed that the university party committees should play a core political role in the school, lead comprehensive ideological and political work, manage cadres, and strengthen leadership over mass organizations such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and student unions. Zhou Pengcheng, the party secretary of Beijing Agricultural University, said that from China's actual situation, it is appropriate for Chinese universities to implement a system where the party committee leads and the president is responsible. In the past two years, the system we implemented was actually a "one-person system," with no place for the party committee to speak. For example, when evaluating professional titles, the secretary had no say, but when problems arose, the party committee had to do the work. The political leadership of the party must be guaranteed by organizational leadership; otherwise, the party's leadership will become amateurish, part-time, and diluted, and in the end, the party's leadership will exist in name only.

Many attendees proposed that universities need a compact and stable political work team to carry out ideological and political work. Currently, the situation where university party cadres, including ideological and political work cadres, are not settled and have no successors is worth noting.

The attendees believed that to govern the party strictly, one must make the greatest effort and be serious about it. Li Wenhai, the party secretary of Renmin University of China, said that to govern the party strictly, one should start from organizational development and control each link. Some comrades are worried that being too strict will lead to "leftist" errors, but this concern is unnecessary. The main problem now is not being too strict but too lax, to the point of being as lax as possible. Li Yijin, the party secretary of Beijing Foreign Studies University, said that in recent years, the quality of the party member cadre team in universities has declined significantly, and there is serious laxity, disorder, and chaos within the party. Ideals and beliefs are rarely mentioned. Those who caused the most trouble this time included some party members. Now, relying solely on ideological education is not enough; one must be determined to rectify the situation.

Many attendees proposed that the chaos within the party is closely related to the chaos in theory and propaganda. Now that the turmoil has passed, one should pay attention to clarifying the chaos in this area. Li Wenhai said that in recent years, the theoretical circle has been very chaotic, with fallacies spreading and causing serious impacts. For example, some people proposed that the party's work should "shed its old skin and grow new flesh," and others proposed that reform is to limit party power. Again, some people opposed party nature and people's nature, etc. Fang Huijian, the party secretary of Tsinghua University, said that literary works that defame the party's image and party cadres have played a role in degrading the party. Fang Fukan said that the relationship between the party and the Communist Youth League, and the party and trade unions has also been confused, all emphasizing that they represent the interests of the masses, as if the Communist Party does not represent the people. Some people also questioned the party's nature as the vanguard of the working class, wanting to reform the party and political work, making the party's work part-time, amateur, and diluted.

The attendees believed that a socialist university must combine teaching with educating people. Fang Huijian proposed that domestic and foreign hostile forces are fiercely competing with us to win over the younger generation, and we must use every means to prevent students from being drawn in. As party member teachers in universities, how to cultivate students with a firm and correct political direction is worth serious study. In recent years, many young teachers have gone abroad for further studies, and they have been influenced a lot. Often, they unconsciously bring in foreign things without analysis. Fang Fukan said that China has a large number of students studying abroad, and in the future, we will continue to send students abroad. We should do a lot of work for the students through various channels and forms, and after they return, we should arrange and use them well.

Song Ping spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, one must have the leadership of the Communist Party. To uphold the party's leadership, one must first build a good party. In the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counterrevolutionary riots, universities have always been on the front line. The party organizations and party members in universities have undergone severe tests. For those party organizations, party workers, and party members who have performed well in this struggle, each school should summarize their experiences and give them due recognition. We have won a battle, but the price paid is great, and there are also many lessons to be learned. How to do the party's work in universities in the future, everyone is thinking and summarizing, which is very necessary. Practice has shown that it is not easy to destroy our party from the outside, and the more they try, the more united our party may become. However, destroying our party from within is very dangerous. The party organizations in universities play an important role in the various work of universities and have an important impact. One should seize the current favorable opportunity to strengthen self-building. From which aspects to strengthen it? This problem is worth studying.

Song Ping said that one must summarize experiences from the root, draw lessons, and strengthen party building. One must resolutely eliminate corruption, build a good party style, and win the trust of the people. This time, the central authorities have taken the lead, and all levels of leadership must start from themselves and do a few practical things. On this issue, everyone must have a sense of urgency and crisis. If one does not strive for improvement, the party will have no hope.

Song Ping emphasized that the fundamental task of higher education institutions is to cultivate successors of the socialist cause who have socialist awareness and scientific and cultural knowledge. One must combine teaching with educating people and, while imparting knowledge to young students, educate them to support the leadership of the Communist Party and follow the socialist path. Now, domestic and foreign hostile forces and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance are desperately competing with us to win over the younger generation. Abroad, hostile forces send spies to operate among the youth in China. Some criminals who have fled abroad have established reactionary organizations, attempting to influence the domestic situation. We must not be complacent and must maintain a clear mind. Our schools must not cultivate our own "gravediggers."

Song Ping said that party organizations must pay attention to carrying out ideological and political work among teachers and students. Doing ideological work requires confidence, and one must speak with a clear conscience. Facts have shown that speaking with a clear conscience can achieve good results.

Song Ping finally said that the work of party organizations in universities is very important and arduous and should be given due attention. University party workers should work hard to establish their authority. Through their efforts in struggle and work, they should establish their image and status.

    宋平邀集首都部分高校负责人座谈
    切实加强高校党的建设工作
    做思想工作要有信心　讲道理要理直气壮
    本报讯　最近，中共中央政治局常委、中央组织部部长宋平主持召开了首都部分高校党委书记、校长座谈会。与会同志就如何加强高校党的建设工作，发表了许多很好的意见和建议。
    参加座谈的同志认为，加强高校党的建设，首先应当充分估计这几年高校党的建设面临的严峻局面。北京大学党委书记王学珍说，不能低估资产阶级自由化对党的队伍的侵蚀，不能低估动乱、暴乱对高校党建工作的影响，不能低估这几年赵紫阳同志淡化党的领导、淡化党的工作造成的恶劣影响。北京师范大学校长方福康说，还应充分估计到国外敌对势力对我们的影响。我校出了个吾尔开希，出了个刘晓波。吾尔开希本来在大家面前说话就哆嗦，三门课考试不及格。后来一家外国广播公司的人专门对他调教了一番，教他怎么回答三门功课不及格的问题，讲话时什么时候停顿，什么时候提高声调，什么时候等待掌声等等。他很快就学会了，还学会了撒谎，耍两面派。
    许多同志提出，高校党委在学校中起政治核心作用，要全面领导思想政治工作，要管干部，要加强对工会、共青团、学生会等群众组织的领导。北京农业大学党委书记周鹏程说，从中国的实际出发，我国高校实行党委领导下的校长负责制比较适宜。前两年，我们搞的校长负责制实际上是“一长制”，党委没有说话的地方。比如评定职称，书记说不上话，但是出了问题，又要党委去做工作。党的政治领导必须有组织领导作保证，否则，党的领导业余化、兼职化、淡化，搞来搞去，党的领导就会名存实亡了。
    许多同志提出，高校开展思想政治工作，需要有一支精干、稳定的政治工作队伍，现在高校党务干部，包括思想政治工作干部不安心、后继乏人的状况值得重视。
    与会同志认为，从严治党，一定要下最大的决心，动真格的。中国人民大学党委书记李文海说，从严治党，应从组织发展开始，一个环节一个环节地把好关。有的同志担心严了，犯
  “左”的错误，这种顾虑没有必要。现在的主要问题不是严了，而是太松了，松到不能再松的地步了。北京外语学院党委书记李宜今说，这几年，高校党员队伍的素质下降很多，党内松、散、乱严重，理想、信念没有多少人讲了。这次闹得最厉害的，有些就是党员。现在，仅靠思想教育是不够的，要下决心进行整顿。
    许多同志提出，党内思想一度相当混乱，同理论、宣传方面的混乱密切相关。现在风波已经过去，应当重视澄清这方面的混乱。李文海说，这几年理论界非常混乱，谬种流传，造成了严重的影响。如有人提出党的工作要“脱胎换骨”，还有人提出改革就是要限制党权。又如把党性和人民性对立起来，等等。清华大学党委书记方惠坚说，文艺作品丑化党的形象和党的干 部，起了贬低党的作用。方福康说，党与共青团，党与工会的关系也弄乱了，都强调自己代表群众利益，好像共产党倒不代表人民。还有人对坚持党的工人阶级先锋队性质提出疑问，要改造党，改造政治工作，党的工作兼职化、业余化、淡化等等。
    参加座谈的同志认为，社会主义的大学，必须把教书与育人结合起来。方惠坚提出，国内外敌对势力在同我们激烈地争夺青年一代，要千方百计把学生拉下水。作为高校党员教师，怎么培养学生具有坚定正确的政治方向，值得认真研究。这几年青年教师去国外进修多，受的影响也多，有的人往往不自觉地把外国的东西不加分析地拿来。方福康说，我国在外国有大批留学生，今后还要不断往外派留学生，应该通过多种途径和形式对留学生多做工作，回来后要很好地安排使用。
    宋平同志在会上讲了话。他指出，建设有中国特色的社会主义现代化事业，必须有共产党的领导。坚持党的领导，首先就要把党建设好。在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，高校一直处在第一线。高校的党组织、党员，经受了严峻的考验。对于在这场斗争中表现好的党组织、党的工作者、党员，各校要好好总结，大力表彰。我们打了一个胜仗，但是付出的代价很大，经验教训也不少。今后高校党的工作究竟怎么做，大家都在思考、总结，这很有必要。实践表明，要从外部把我们党搞垮是不容易的，越搞我们党可能越团结。但是从内部来搞垮我们党，则很危险。高校党的组织在高校的各项工作中处于重要的地位，起着重要的作用，要抓住当前的有利时机，加强自身建设。从哪些方面来加强？这个问题值得研究。
    宋平说，要从根本上总结经验，吸取教训，加强党的建设。要坚决清除腐败，建设一个好的党风，取信于民。这次中央带了头，各级领导都要从自己做起，做几件实实在在的事情。在这个问题上，大家要有紧迫感和危机感。不思振作，党就没有希望。
    宋平强调，高等院校的根本任务，是要培养有社会主义觉悟的有科学文化知识的社会主义事业的接班人。要把教书和育人统一起来，在向青年学生传授知识的同时，教育他们拥护共产党的领导，走社会主义道路。现在，国内外敌对势力，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，在拚命同我们争夺年轻一代。国外，敌对势力向我国派遣特务到青年中去活动。一些外逃的犯罪分子建立了反动组织，企图影响国内。对此，我们不能掉以轻心，要保持清醒的头脑。我们的学校，绝不能培养自己的
  “掘墓人”。
    宋平说，党组织要重视在教师、学生中开展思想政治工作。做思想工作要有信心，要理直气壮地讲话。事实表明，理直气壮地讲，才能收到好的效果。
    宋平最后说，高等院校党组织的工作很重要，也很艰苦，应当受到重视。高校党务工作者要努力工作，把威信树起来。在斗争中工作中通过自己的努力，树立自己的形象，确立自己的地位。
