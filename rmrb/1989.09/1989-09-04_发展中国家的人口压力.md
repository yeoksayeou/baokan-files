According to the latest projections from the United Nations Population Fund, the world's population will reach 14.2 billion by the year 2100, rather than the previously estimated 10.2 billion. This figure is nearly three times the current world population of 5.2 billion. Currently, the world's population increases by 80 million annually, with over 70 million of these new additions born in developing countries. Meanwhile, the developed countries of the West, which account for approximately 80% of the world's total production, constitute only 20% of the global population. This extreme imbalance in population growth further widens the economic development gap between the South and the North and exacerbates the ecological environment in developing countries.

The rapid increase in population pressure in developing countries is due to several factors. Primarily, some developing countries' governments have failed to consistently implement policies aimed at controlling population growth and improving population quality. From 1985 to the present, 37 of the world's poorest countries have scaled back their family planning programs due to economic difficulties. Secondly, the rural population is excessively large, traditional mindsets are deeply ingrained, and inadequate propaganda and education have made it challenging to implement family planning measures in rural areas. Thirdly, economic poverty has trapped many developing countries in a vicious cycle: economic backwardness, low per capita income, inadequate environmental protection, rapid population growth, low labor quality, and economic development stagnation. Lastly, the international community and the United Nations Population Fund have limited funds for family planning, which are insufficient to meet the needs. Currently, the international community spends $3 billion annually on family planning in developing countries. Experts from the Population Crisis Committee in Washington estimate that this amount only meets half of the actual need. Additionally, some Western countries' anti-abortion rhetoric has hindered the fundraising efforts of the Population Fund and disrupted the normal implementation of family planning measures in developing countries.

The increasing population burden in developing countries threatens their political, economic, and ecological stability. This is evident in several ways. Firstly, rapid population growth has become a significant factor in the frequent government changes and social unrest in many developing countries, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. A recent report by the Population Crisis Committee, which studied 120 countries, indicates that 101 of these countries experience social unrest due to population factors. In developing countries, 60% of the population is under 20 years old, and 50% is under 15 years old. This highly youthful population structure fuels extreme emotions in both urban and rural areas, leading to increased crime rates.

Secondly, the rate of population growth in most developing countries is inversely proportional to the level of education. Excessive population growth beyond economic capacity results in limited educational opportunities, outdated facilities, and low labor quality. While developing countries have grand plans to industrialize by adopting Western technology, the development of the economy and technology will eventually lead to a severe structural shortage of labor, hindering economic growth and making it difficult to increase per capita income, or even causing it to decline. In South Asia and most of Africa, per capita income is only 1/50th of that in Western countries, while in South America and the Caribbean, it is 1/10th. Low per capita income traps most developing countries in another vicious cycle: low savings rates, insufficient funds for family planning, rapid population growth, and low per capita income. The rapid population increase creates enormous additional demand, exacerbating the supply tension of energy and raw materials in the global market, worsening the trade conditions for developing countries, leading to international payment imbalances, and exacerbating the financial shortage.

Lastly, rapid population growth has deteriorated the ecological environment in developing countries. On one hand, due to overpopulation, people have had to shorten the traditional fallow period (which is necessary for soil conservation), leading to soil erosion and depletion. The increasing burden per unit of land hinders the improvement of labor productivity, making the food crisis more severe. Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization believe that rapid population growth has led to a continuous decline in agricultural investment in developing countries, resulting in an increase in the number of people who cannot obtain the minimum food supply from 76 million in 1975 to 486 million by 2000. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, in recent years, the grain production growth rate in Latin American countries has been equal to the population growth rate, with all the increased grain being consumed. In Africa, grain production has increased by 19%, but the population has increased by 28%. From 1980 to 1988, the per capita grain supply in Africa decreased by 6.5%.

The severe overpopulation in developing countries will adversely affect the development of the world economy and the protection of the global ecological environment. The international community and relevant United Nations agencies have expressed deep concern about this issue and repeatedly called for strengthening economic cooperation between the South and the North. At the same time, they have urged developing countries to formulate practical family planning policies based on their national conditions to control population growth and achieve the goals of eugenics, optimal childbearing, and promoting economic development.

    发展中国家的人口压力
    刘光溪
    △在每年增加的8000万世界人口中，7000多万出生在发展中国家
    △日趋沉重的人口负担危及了发展中国家政治、经济和生态环境的稳定
    △人口增长速度同受教育程度呈反比，到一定阶段劳动力将出现结构性有限供给△人口增长的极度不平衡进一步拉开了南北之间业已存在的经济发展水平的差距
    据联合国人口基金的最新预测，到2100年世界人口将增至142亿，而不是原来的估计数字102亿。142亿约是现在世界人口总数52亿的近3倍。目前，世界人口每年增加8000万，其中7000多万的新增人口出生在发展中国家，而占世界总产值约80％的西方发达国家仅占世界总人口的20％。这种人口增长的极度不平衡，进一步拉开了南北之间业已存在的经济发展水平的差距，进一步恶化了发展中国家的生态环境。
    发展中国家人口压力急剧增加的原因是多方面的，归结起来主要是：1、一些发展中国家政府制定的限制人口增长、提高人口素质的政策没能善始善终地执行。从1985年至今的4年中，就有37个世界上最穷的国家因经济困难而压缩了节制生育的计划。2、农业人口过多，传统思想根深蒂固，加之宣传教育不力，致使在广大农村地区落实计划生育措施阻力重重。3、经济贫困使许多发展中国家陷入一种恶性循环：经济落后——人均收入低——对生态环境保护关心程度不高——人口过速增长——劳动力素质低——经济发展落后。4、国际社会和联合国人口基金用于计划生育的资金有限，难以满足需要。目前，国际社会用于发展中国家计划生育的总支出为30亿美元。据设在华盛顿的人口危机委员会的专家估计，30亿美元仅能满足一半的需要。另外，西方一些国家所谓反对堕胎的论调也在不同程度上妨碍了人口基金的筹措，干扰了发展中国家正常执行计划生育的措施。
    发展中国家日趋沉重的人口负担危及到了它们的政治、经济和生态环境的稳定。其主要表现是：首先，人口急剧增长成为许多发展中国家政府频繁更迭和社会动荡的一个重要因素，非洲和中东地区尤其如此。人口危机委员会最近公布的一份研究120个国家的报告指出，由人口因素引起社会动荡的国家有101个。在发展中国家的人口中，有60％在20岁以下，50％在15岁以下，这种高度年轻化的人口结构使城乡中极端情绪高涨，犯罪率上升。
    其次，人口增长的速度同受教育的程度在多数发展中国家呈反比。超过经济承受能力的人口增长，造成教育普及面小、设施落后、劳动力素质低。发展中国家虽有引进西方技术实现工业化的宏伟蓝图，但随着经济和科技的发展，到一定阶段劳动力就会出现严重的结构性有限供给，抑制经济的发展，造成人均收入难以增长甚至趋跌。在亚洲南部和非洲大部分地区，人均收入只有西方国家的1／50，在南美和加勒比地区，这个比例为1／10。过低的人均收入又使大部分发展中国家陷入了另一种恶性循环：储蓄率低——用于计划生育的资金短缺——人口急剧增长——人均收入低。由于人口急剧增加造成了巨大的追加需求，以初级加工产品和能源密集型产品为主的发展中国家，就会加剧世界市场上的能源和原材料的供应紧张状况，进而恶化发展中国家的贸易条件，导致国际收支不平衡，使资金短缺状况雪上加霜。
    最后，人口急剧增长恶化了发展中国家的生态环境。一方面，由于人口过剩，人们不得不缩短撂荒地的传统期限（这是保持地力的必要期限），致使土壤表层侵蚀，地力衰竭。单位土地面积的负荷不断增加，阻碍了劳动生产率的提高，粮食危机变得日益严重。粮农组织的专家认为，人口急剧增加造成了发展中国家的农业投资持续下降，得不到最低限度粮食供给的人口数将从1975年的7600万增加到2000年的4.86亿。据粮农组织统计，近年来，拉美国家的粮食生产增长率和人口增长率相等，增产的粮食全都被吃掉了。非洲的粮食生产增长了19％，人口却增加了28％，从1980年到1988年，非洲人均粮食供应减少了6.5％。
    发展中国家严重的人口过剩，将不利于世界经济的发展和整个世界生态环境的保护。国际社会和联合国的有关机构对此深表关注，一再呼吁加强南北间的经济合作；同时，也要求发展中国家根据各国国情，制定切实可行的计划生育政策，控制人口的增长，以达到优生优育、促进经济发展的目标。
