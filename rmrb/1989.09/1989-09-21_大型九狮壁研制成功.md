    The large nine-lion wall, jointly developed by Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts and Beijing Xishan Glazed Tile Factory, has been successfully completed.

    The wall is 27.5 meters long and 1.2 meters wide at the base. The core of the wall features nine large lion statues, each accompanied by eight smaller lions. In total, the wall is adorned with over 2,000 large and small lion statues. Using seven colors of glaze—yellow, green, blue, purple, jade, black, and white—along with natural glazing effects achieved through kiln firing, the wall displays a vibrant array of colors.
