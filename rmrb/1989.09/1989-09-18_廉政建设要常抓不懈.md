Anti-corruption and maintaining integrity are not only urgent requirements at present, but also a long-term task in Party building. Therefore, we must resolutely solve existing problems while also doing the foundational work that will have long-term effects. To further advance anti-corruption efforts, we must combine short-term measures with long-term solutions, and strengthen our work in areas such as ideology, organization, and systems.

First, we must firmly establish the idea of "two hands," ensuring that anti-corruption efforts are persistent. The idea of "two hands" is not new. As early as the beginning of the reform and opening-up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We must use one hand to promote openness and vitality, and the other hand to crack down on economic crimes"; "We must use one hand to build, and the other hand to build the legal system"; "We must use one hand to build material civilization, and the other hand to build spiritual civilization." This not only ensures the smooth progress of reform and opening-up but also has important guiding significance for strengthening Party building and maintaining the Party's integrity. In a previous period, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization, some comrades did not deeply understand or effectively implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of "two hands." During the years when the "leftist" trend was rampant, the power of spiritual morality was overly exaggerated, economic construction was neglected, and people's material interests were denied; after the focus of work shifted to economic construction, there was a tendency to overly exaggerate the power of material and money and to belittle the role of spiritual morality. Economic construction and anti-corruption efforts are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Material conditions determine spiritual conditions, and spiritual conditions react back on material conditions. We cannot emphasize one side while neglecting the other. While focusing on economic work, we must not forget anti-corruption efforts. Not only those in charge of Party and political work should focus on this, but those in charge of economic work should also pay attention to it. "Two hands" can be divided, but cannot be separated. Some people do not understand the relationship between anti-corruption and economic construction, fearing that focusing on anti-corruption will affect economic work. The facts are not like this. Many units that have done well in economic construction are not relying on crooked methods, but on a strong sense of duty and responsibility, on the spirit of hard work, on legitimate business operations, on product quality, and on credibility. Some units, although they have made a name for themselves through entertaining and gift-giving, and pulling strings, have ultimately fallen.

"Two hands" is a strategic measure that cannot be sustained for a short period but must be carried through from the beginning to the end of reform and opening-up. This is because people's ideological awareness and moral cultivation are related to changes in material conditions, but they do not develop in direct proportion. The transformation of ideology and the improvement of moral cultivation rely on constant education and guidance. Therefore, at any time and under any circumstances, we must maintain a clear mind and carry out anti-corruption efforts persistently.

Second, we must strengthen ideological education and strive to improve the political quality of the broad masses of Party members. People's behavior is controlled by their thoughts. In the same environment of reform and opening-up, facing the same situation of the development of a commodity economy, why do some Party members remain unyielding and uncorrupted in the face of money and material goods, while others cannot stand firm and even degenerate and become corrupt? The key factor here is the level of ideological awareness and personal morality. To tackle anti-corruption, we must do practical work, investigate cases, and solve problems that the masses are concerned about. But if we do not build a dam in our minds, it will be difficult to solve the problem from the root. In the 1950s, our Party had a good atmosphere because we often educated Party members against corruption before and after entering the city. Therefore, we must inherit and carry forward this tradition, strengthen ideological education, and strive to improve the political quality of Party members, so that every Party member can remain clean in politics whether or not they are supervised.

Third, we must establish and improve systems and strengthen the constraint mechanism. System issues have stability and long-term characteristics. A good system can prevent bad people from running amok, while a bad system can prevent good people from doing good things and may even lead to the opposite. Many of the corrupt phenomena within the Party are related to the lack of a sound system and effective constraints. Some comrades believe that rectifying the Party's style and strengthening anti-corruption efforts, the leading cadres setting an example is more important than anything else. This is correct. But there cannot be a lack of system constraints. The system has a universal binding force, and it plays a compulsory role. If you do not act according to the system, you will be punished. Ideological education is important, but ideological education is not omnipotent, so there must be system constraints, and it is not allowed to do as one pleases. Therefore, system building is a fundamental measure to maintain integrity.

Currently, our legal system is not yet perfect, and the central and provincial governments have made regulations in major areas, but it is not possible to cover every aspect, so each locality needs to formulate specific system regulations to make up for the deficiencies. Formulating systems should be based on reality, be targeted and feasible, and not just for show or high-sounding slogans. If it is not mature, do not formulate it; if it is formulated, execute it resolutely. Formulating systems should rely on the masses and not be done by a few people behind closed doors. It should not only constrain others and the masses but also constrain leaders. It should be democratic and transparent, and it should be made public. Formulating systems should be meticulous, with not only what is not allowed but also what to do if it is violated, increasing rigidity and reducing flexibility, so as to facilitate organizational and mass supervision. Systems should maintain relative stability, but they are not permanent and unchanging. They should be continuously improved as time and circumstances change. If the situation changes and the system is not revised or supplemented, the system will not work.

Fourth, we must build a good leadership team at all levels to ensure integrity from an organizational perspective. The key to promoting anti-corruption efforts is leadership. The facts show that regardless of the system or unit, if the leadership team is clean and upright, it is less likely to have problems, and if there are problems, they can be corrected and solved in a timely manner. If the leadership team is not clean and upright, it loses its say, how can it confidently promote anti-corruption efforts?

To fundamentally ensure the Party's integrity, we must focus on building a clean and upright leadership team. We must consider integrity when examining cadres, evaluate integrity when evaluating cadres, and prioritize integrity when appointing cadres. We must regularly focus on examining current leading cadres, especially those in charge of personnel, finances, and materials. Those who are not clean themselves and cannot resolutely fight against corruption must be adjusted out of the leadership team. When selecting cadres, we must consider integrity as an important aspect of evaluating their character. Those who are not clean and those who love to be greedy and take bribes, no matter how capable they are, cannot enter the leadership team or key departments. Only in this way can we provide organizational guarantees for anti-corruption efforts.

　　廉政建设要常抓不懈
　　李明珠
    反对腐败，保持廉洁，不仅是当前的迫切要求，也是党的建设的一项长期任务。因此，既要痛下决心，切切实实解决现实存在的问题，又要做好长期起作用的基础工作。要使廉政建设再深入一步，必须把治标与治本结合起来，从思想、组织、制度等方面进一步加强建设。
    一、牢固树立“两手抓”的思想，做到廉政建设常抓不懈。“两手抓”不是现在才提出来的。早在改革开放之初，邓小平同志就指出：“要一手抓对外开放，对内搞活，一手抓打击经济犯罪”；
  “一手抓建设，一手抓法制”；“一手抓物质文明建设，一手抓精神文明建设”。这不仅对于保证改革开放的顺利进行，而且对于加强党的建设，保持党的廉洁具有重要的指导意义。前一个时期，由于受资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，我们有些同志对邓小平同志“两手抓”的思想理解得不深，贯彻得不力。极左思潮盛行的年月，过于夸大精神道德的力量，忽视经济建设，否认人们应享有的物质利益；工作重点转移到经济建设以后，又出现过分夸大物质和金钱的力量，贬低精神道德的作用的倾向。经济建设与廉政建设是互相依赖、互相作用的统一体。物质决定精神，精神反作用于物质。不可重视一方，忽视一方。抓经济工作，切不可忘记抓廉政建设，不仅主管党务工作、政治工作的同志，要集中精力抓，主管经济工作的同志也要注意抓。“两手抓”可以分工，但不能分家。有人对廉政建设与经济建设的关系认识不清，担心抓廉政建设会影响经济工作，事实完全不是这样。许多经济建设搞得好的单位，并不是靠邪门歪道，而是靠强烈的事业心和责任感，靠艰苦奋斗的精神，靠正当经营，靠产品质量，靠守信誉而发展的。有的单位，虽然通过请客送礼，走后门，一时也搞出一点名堂，但最终还是摔了下来。
      “两手抓”是一项战略性措施，不能坚持一阵子，必须贯穿于改革、开放的始终。这是因为，人们的思想觉悟和道德修养的提高与物质条件的变化有关系，但不是成正比例发展的。思想的转变，道德修养的提高，赖以经常性的教育引导。所以，我们在任何时候任何情况下，都要保持清醒的头脑，把廉政建设持久地开展下去。
    二、加强思想教育，努力提高广大党员的政治素质。人们的行为是靠思想支配的。同样处在改革开放的环境，同样面对商品经济发展的形势，为什么有些党员干部在金钱物质面前，不弯腰，不伸手，保持廉洁，一尘不染；而有的党员则不能站稳脚跟，甚至自甘堕落，腐化变质？这里起重要作用的是思想觉悟的高低，个人品德的好坏。抓廉政建设，当然要办实事，查案子，解决群众关心的问题。但如果不从思想上筑起堤防，很难从根本上解决问题。五十年代我们党之所以有一个良好的风气，是与我们党在进城以前和进城以后，经常地对党员进行反腐蚀教育分不开的。因此，我们一定要继承和发扬这个传统，切实加强思想教育工作，努力提高党员的政治素质，使每个党员无论在有人监督还是没有人监督的情况下，都能做到为政清廉。
    三、建立健全制度，强化约束机制。制度问题带有稳定性和长期性。制度好可以使坏人无法任意横行，制度不好可以使好人无法做好事，甚至会走向反面。党内出现的许多腐败现象，不少与制度不健全，缺乏有力的约束有关。有些同志认为，端正党风，加强廉政建设，领导干部作表率比什么都灵，这是对的。但不能没有制度约束。制度有着普遍的约束力，它发挥的是一种强制性作用，不按制度办事不行，违背制度要受处罚。思想教育是重要的，但思想教育也不是万能的，这就要有制度约束，不允许愿怎么做就怎么做。所以说，制度建设是一项保持廉洁的根本性措施。
    目前我们的法制还不健全、不完善，中央和省在大的方面作了规定，但不可能方方面面都涉及到，这就需要各个地方制定出具体的制度规定，弥补其不足。制定制度应该从实际出发，要有针对性、可行性，不能摆样子、唱高调。不成熟的就不定，定了的就坚决执行。制定制度要依靠群众，不能少数人闭门造车，不能只约束别人，约束群众，不约束领导，要讲民主，讲透明度，要公布于众。制定制度要力求缜密，既要有不允许怎么办，还要有违反了怎么办，增强刚性，减少弹性，以利组织和群众监督。制度要保持相对稳定性，但也不是永久不变的，要随着时间和形势的变化，不断完善。情况变了，不修订，不补充，制度就不起作用了。
    四、建设好各级领导班子，从组织上保证廉洁。搞好廉政建设，领导是关键。事实说明，不管哪个系统，哪个单位，领导班子廉洁清正，就不容易出什么问题，出了问题也能够及时纠正解决。领导班子不清正，失去说话的资本，怎么能理直气壮地去抓廉政建设？
    要从根本上保证党的廉洁，必须把建设清正廉洁的领导班子作为关键来抓。做到考察干部要考廉，评议干部要评廉，任用干部要重廉。要经常对现任领导干部，特别是掌管人、财、物的干部进行重点考察。自身不廉洁的、不能坚决同腐败现象作斗争的，要从领导班子中调整出去。选拔干部要把廉洁不廉洁作为考德的重要方面。不廉洁的人，爱贪好沾的人，本事再大也不能进领导班子和要害部门。只有这样，才能从组织上为廉政建设提供保证。
