The Metropolitan Police in London have recently suggested that every telephone user should have a whistle ready, placed next to the telephone. If a woman receives a call from a stranger speaking obscenely, she can blow the whistle into the receiver. The sharp whistle sound can cause interference and sometimes even damage the eardrum of the caller. The police have distributed a 20-page booklet to every household, providing guidance on how to deal with criminals who harass women. The above method is one of the suggestions in the booklet. The headline of an article in The Times on August 14th reads: "13 million women are victims of sexual crimes." The newspaper reported that after Life magazine surveyed 1,000 women, it was found that nearly half of them had experienced sexual harassment in the past five years, including receiving obscene phone calls. Based on this proportion, the newspaper estimated that 13 million women nationwide are under the threat of sexual crimes. For such "minor offenses," the vast majority of women are too embarrassed to speak out and endure it in silence, unwilling to report to the police. This makes it difficult for the police to effectively punish morally corrupt individuals.

Many incidents of harassing women occur on the subway or other public transportation, so traffic police have called on victims to bravely report these incidents. Female police officers have been assigned to handle these cases, talking to the victims privately to gather clues and catch the culprits, preventing such criminal behavior from escalating into a situation that disrupts social order. It seems that the gentlemen in suits at the club might lament the decline of morality and the decline of the British Empire.

### 哨子的妙用……  英国妇女受人身侮辱威胁

　　哨子的妙用……
　  英国妇女受人身侮辱威胁
    大伦敦警察局最近建议每个电话用户准备1个哨子，放在电话机旁。妇女一旦接到陌生人打电话来说下流话时，可以对着话筒吹哨子，尖锐的哨音既能起干扰作用，有时还可以伤害对方的耳鼓膜。警察局挨户赠送1本20页的小册子，指导如何对付侮辱妇女的犯罪者。上述的方法就是其中之一。《泰晤士报》8月14日一条新闻的标题是：“1300万妇女是性犯罪受害者”。该报说《生活》杂志对1000名妇女进行调查后，发现其中几乎半数在最近5年内曾受过性侮辱，包括接到说下流话的电话。该报按照这个比例推算出全国有1300万妇女处于性犯罪的威胁之下。对于这种“轻微罪行”，绝大多数妇女都羞于张扬，隐忍不言，不愿向警察局报告。这就使警方无法有效地对道德败坏分子予以惩戒。
    许多污辱妇女行为发生在地铁或其他公共车辆上，因此交通警察号召受害妇女勇于报告，并安排女警员负责和她们单独谈话，以便取得线索抓获坏分子，防止这种犯罪行为发展成破坏社会安宁的恶劣风气。看来，俱乐部里穿礼服的文雅绅士们似乎要慨叹世风日下和大英帝国的悲哀了。　（封）
