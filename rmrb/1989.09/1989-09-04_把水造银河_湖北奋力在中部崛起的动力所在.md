	Water power is Hubei's advantage; "Galaxy" is a metaphor for the power grid. Developing hydropower vigorously and "turning water into a 'Galaxy'" is the driving force behind Hubei's rise.

	In Hubei, the Yangtze River and Han River flow through the province, with numerous large and small rivers crisscrossing. According to surveys, the province has approximately 38 million kilowatts of exploitable hydropower resources, with an annual electricity output of over 140 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to 60 million tons of standard coal. This is a unique advantage for Hubei, which is severely short of coal.

	However, in the long history of old China, these precious water resources were almost entirely wasted. "Turning water into a 'Galaxy'" could only be realized in New China.

	The majestic dam—the "Great Wall of China" that bisects China's largest river—the world-renowned Gezhouba Hydropower Project on the Yangtze River was fully completed in 1988, with 21 generating units of the Gezhouba Hydropower Station, totaling 2.715 million kilowatts, all put into operation. This is a Chinese miracle and a glorious page in the history of world hydropower. By this time, over 40 years, the province had built 230 hydropower stations with a capacity of more than 500 kilowatts, with a total installed capacity of 4.3318 million kilowatts and an annual power generation of 20.734 billion kilowatt-hours, both ranking first among all provinces and municipalities in the country.

	Previously, from 1958 to 1987, Hubei built the Danjiangkou Hydropower Project, known as the "Pearl of the Han River," with an installed capacity of 900,000 kilowatts. In the brilliant "Galaxy," small and medium-sized hydropower stations are scattered everywhere. In addition to medium-sized hydropower stations such as Huanglongtan Power Station, Fushui Power Station, Bailianhe Power Station, and Lu Power Station, by the end of 1988, the province had built 2,659 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of 750,000 kilowatts. Starting in 1987, Hubei began construction of the Geheyan Hydropower Station on the Qingjiang River with an installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts, indicating that another relatively large "star" would rise in the sky of Chu and join the "Galaxy." While "turning water into a 'Galaxy,'" Hubei also actively developed thermal power. Over 40 years, 42 thermal power stations with a capacity of more than 500 kilowatts, including Huangshi Power Station, Wuchang Power Station, Qingshan Thermal Power Station, Jingmen Thermal Power Station, Songmuping Power Station, and Shashi Power Station, were built in the eastern load center of Hubei, with a total installed capacity of 1.92 million kilowatts. Starting in 1987, the construction of the Hanchuan Power Station with an installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts was also begun to improve the weak power grid structure.

	The "Galaxy" illuminates the sky, and light shines across the land. Today's Hubei has the largest hydropower base in the country, the largest substation in the country, the country's first 500-kilovolt ultra-high-voltage AC transmission line, and the country's first ±500-kilovolt ultra-high-voltage DC transmission line. The coverage rate of rural power grids has reached more than 84%. The per capita electricity consumption is over 500 kilowatt-hours, more than 150 times that of the pre-liberation era.

	Recently, the reporter saw the "Daily Power Generation Report" dated August 1 in the office of the Hubei Provincial Electric Power Bureau, which stated: "The planned power generation for the day is 85.8 million kilowatt-hours, and the actual power generation is 89.04 million kilowatt-hours." These two figures show that the current daily output has exceeded the annual power generation of pre-liberation Hubei—85 million kilowatt-hours. Commenting on Hubei's achievement of "turning water into a 'Galaxy,'" it is entirely justified to write "remarkable."

### 把水造银河  湖北奋力在中部崛起的动力所在

    把水造银河
    湖北奋力在中部崛起的动力所在
    水力，湖北的优势；“银河”，电网的代称。大力发展水电，“把水造‘银河’”，是湖北崛起的动力所在。
    在湖北，长江、汉水穿越境内，大小河流纵横贯通。据勘测，全省可开发利用的水力资源约为3800万千瓦，年电量1400多亿千瓦时，相当于6000万吨标准煤。这对于严重缺煤的湖北来说，又算是得天独厚。
    然而，在漫漫旧中国，宝贵的水力资源几乎全部付诸东流。“把水造‘银河’”，只在新中国才能实现。
    巍巍大坝——腰斩中国第一大河的“中国的新的长城”，举世瞩目的长江葛洲坝水利枢纽工程，于1988年全面竣工，装机271.5万千瓦的葛洲坝水电厂21台机组全部投产。这是中国的奇迹，也在世界水电史上写下了光辉的一页。至此，40年来，全省已建成500千瓦以上的水电厂230个，装机容量达433.18万千瓦，年发电量207.34亿千瓦时，均居全国各省市水电第一位。
    此前，1958年至1987年，湖北兴建了被称为“汉水明珠”的丹江口水利枢纽工程，装机容量90万千瓦。在灿烂的“银河”中，中小型水电站更是星罗棋布。除黄龙滩电厂、富水电厂、白莲河电厂、陆水电厂等中型水电站外，到1988年底，全省已建成小水电站2659处，总容量75万千瓦。1987年始，湖北又动工兴建装机120万千瓦的清江隔河岩水电厂，预示着又一颗较大的“明星”将在楚天升起，汇入“银河”。湖北“把水造
  ‘银河’”的同时，也积极发展火电。40年来，在鄂东负荷中心先后建起了黄石电厂、武昌电厂、青山热电厂、荆门热电厂、松木坪电厂、沙市电厂等500千瓦以上的火电厂42个，装机容量192万千瓦。1987年始，又动工兴建装机120万千瓦的汉川电厂，以期改善薄弱的电网结构。
      “银河”照九天，光明遍大地。如今的湖北，有全国最大的水电基地，全国最大的变电站，全国第一条500千伏超高压交流输电线路，全国第一条正负500千伏超高压直流输电线路。农村电网的覆盖率已达到84％以上。全省人均电量500多千瓦时，已是解放前的150多倍。
    日前，记者在湖北省电力工业局办公室看到今年8月1日的“电力生产日报”，上面写着：“当天计划发电量8580万千瓦时，实际发电量8904万千瓦时。”这两个数据表明，现今的日产量已超过解放前湖北全省一年的电力产量——8500万千瓦时。评论湖北“把水造‘银河’”的成就，完全可以当之无愧地写上“斐然”二字。　（朱修鑫）
