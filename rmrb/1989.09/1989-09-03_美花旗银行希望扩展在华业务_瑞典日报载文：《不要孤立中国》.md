	Citibank Aims to Expand Its Business in China
	Swedish Daily: "Do Not Isolate China"

	HONG KONG, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Citibank's China branch manager Huang Yishao told a Xinhua reporter that Citibank is willing to continue expanding its business in China. Therefore, it hopes that China's political situation remains stable and that foreign countries continue to actively participate in investing in China.

	Huang Yishao introduced that in recent years, Citibank has not only conducted letter of credit business and provided interbank and consulting services in China, but has also actively participated in the financing of major construction projects in China. For example, as the lead bank and vice-lead bank, it participated in the international syndicated loans for projects such as the Shanghai 300,000-ton ethylene project, the China International Trade Center, the Shenzhen Shajiao Power Plant, and the Panzhihua Steel Plant.

	Huang Yishao said that from a long-term perspective, China is a market with great potential. If conditions are suitable, Citibank hopes to continue expanding its business in China.

	STOCKHOLM, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Stockholm Chamber of Commerce President Svarthin today published an article in the Swedish Daily, advocating that Sweden should not join the forces attempting to isolate China.

	The Stockholm Chamber of Commerce has significant influence in the international business community. The article, titled "Do Not Isolate China," states that recent events in China have sparked global reactions, and some countries have taken sanctions against China. However, it is highly questionable whether this is the correct approach to positively influence China's situation.

	The article states: "Economic sanctions are almost always ineffective, or their results are the opposite of the original intention. Only economic sanctions decided by the United Nations are justified. Therefore, Sweden and the Swedish business community have no reason to join the forces advocating the isolation of China."

    美花旗银行希望扩展在华业务
    瑞典日报载文：《不要孤立中国》
    新华社香港9月1日电　（记者史晓帆）美国花旗银行中国区行长黄翼超在接受本社记者采访时表示，花旗银行愿意继续扩展在中国的业务，因此希望中国的政局保持稳定，也希望看到外国继续积极参与在中国的投资。
    黄翼超介绍说，几年来，花旗银行在中国除了开展信用证业务、提供同业及咨询服务外，还积极参与中国大型建设项目的融资，如作为牵头银行及副牵头银行参与了对上海30万吨乙烯工程、中国国际贸易中心、深圳沙角发电厂、攀枝花钢铁厂等工程的国际银团贷款。
    黄翼超说，从长远看，中国是一个具有很大潜力的市场。如条件合适的话，花旗银行希望继续扩展在中国的业务。
    新华社斯德哥尔摩9月1日电　斯德哥尔摩商会会长斯瓦廷今天在《瑞典日报》发表文章，主张瑞典不要加入企图孤立中国的势力。
    斯德哥尔摩商会在国际商界很有影响。这篇题为《不要孤立中国》的文章说，最近中国发生的事件在全世界引起反响，一些国家对中国采取了制裁行动。然而，这是否就是影响中国局势积极发展的正确做法，是很值得怀疑的。
    文章说：“经济制裁几乎总是表明是无效的，或者其结果与原目的相反。只有由联合国决定的经济制裁才是站得住脚的。因此，瑞典和瑞典经济界没有理由加入主张孤立中国的势力。”
