A small paper mill pollutes an entire river
The State Council's Environmental Protection Commission sends inspectors to Henan
Requires immediate measures to shut down and rectify

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou on September 12th: (China Environmental News reporter Wang Wenli, our reporter Liu Yaming) The inspection team of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission recently pointed out during their inspection of Henan Province's environmental protection work: Small paper mills that seriously harm the ecological environment must be resolutely shut down, and there must be no leniency or indulgence.

The inspection team, led by Vice Chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission and Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, Liu Mingpu, inspected the environmental protection situation in Henan Province in early September.

It is understood that the water pollution situation in Henan is still very serious. The province discharges approximately 1.2 billion tons of industrial wastewater into surface water bodies each year, of which 1 billion tons are untreated, resulting in varying degrees of pollution to many urban drinking water sources. Several major cities have one or two rivers flowing through the urban areas that are severely polluted, turning into urban sewers, not only affecting the city itself but also harming downstream areas. In particular, the numerous small paper mills scattered throughout the province cause extremely severe pollution to rivers and water sources.

Among the more than 9,000 small paper mills nationwide, Henan Province alone has 1,300, with 430 in the city of Xinxiang. These small paper mills have high raw material and energy consumption, primitive technology, outdated equipment, and low efficiency. Often, a single mill can pollute an entire river, and immediate measures must be taken to resolutely rectify the situation.

At the same time, the inspection team also learned that in recent years, some cities in Henan Province have made significant progress in environmental protection work. For example, Anyang City has formulated 11 environmental protection plans for air, surface water, groundwater, noise pollution, and greening since 1986, and taken measures to strictly implement the plans, improving the urban environment.

　　一爿小纸厂就污染一条河
　　国务院环委会派员赴豫检查
　　要求尽快采取措施关停整治
    据新华社郑州9月12日电　（《中国环境报》记者王文利、本社记者刘雅鸣）国务院环境保护委员会视察组最近在检查河南省环保工作时提出：对严重危害生态环境的小造纸厂要坚决采取关停措施，决不能姑息迁就。
    由国务院环境保护委员会副主任、中国人民解放军总后勤部副部长刘明璞率领的这个视察组，9月上旬检查了河南省的环境保护情况。
    据了解，河南水污染情况仍然十分严重。全省每年排入地面水体的工业废水约12亿吨，其中10亿吨未经任何处理，致使不少城镇的饮用水源地遭到不同程度的污染。几个主要城市都有一两条流经市区的河流受到严重污染，变成城市的下水道，不仅影响本市，而且危害下游。尤其是遍布全省的乡镇小造纸厂，对河流、水源的污染极其严重。
    在全国目前9000余家小造纸厂中，河南省就有1300家，其中新乡一市就有430家。这些小纸厂原料、能源消耗高，工艺简陋，设备陈旧，效益低，往往一个厂就污染一条河，必须尽快采取措施坚决加以整治。
    同时，视察组也了解到，河南省一些城市环保工作这几年取得了明显的进展。如安阳市从1986年起先后制定了防治大气、地表水、地下水、噪声污染及园林绿化等11项环境保护规划，并采取措施严格按照规划要求付诸实施，使城市环境状况有所改善。
