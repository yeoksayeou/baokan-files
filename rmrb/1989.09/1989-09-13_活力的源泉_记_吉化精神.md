The Jilin Chemical Industry Company, known as a pearl on the banks of the Songhua River, has shone even brighter in the era of reform and opening up. This chemical industry base, established during the First Five-Year Plan, is now one of the top ten enterprises in the country. The 100,000 employees of Jilin Chemical, with their "Jilin Chemical Spirit" of unity, progress, and practicality, have driven the enterprise to achieve high efficiency, high benefits, and modernization. Jilin Chemical has produced the most taxes and the highest quality products in the industry, and has been named a national model for ideological and political work for five consecutive years.

Why has Jilin Chemical developed so rapidly? The people of Jilin Chemical have a vivid explanation: "Reform is the sail, the Four Cardinal Principles are the rudder. With the sail raised high and the rudder firmly in hand, the enterprise ship will sail smoothly and swiftly." Under this guiding ideology, Jilin Chemical has insisted on the organic integration of ideological and political work with economic work, cultivating the enterprise spirit, promoting enterprise progress, and coordinating the development of material and spiritual civilization, thus achieving remarkable results.

The Spiritual Pillar of 100,000 Employees

During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in May and early June of this year, thousands of outsiders gathered at the gates of Jilin Chemical, shouting, "Jilin Chemical, take to the streets! Jilin Chemical, go on strike!" However, not a single Jilin Chemical employee left their post or joined the protests. None of the dozens of schools under its jurisdiction stopped classes, and production and learning continued as usual. An old worker advised the students, "Do you know that Jilin Chemical's daily output is worth tens of millions of yuan, with taxes of over 400 million yuan? If production stops for ten days or half a month, how much damage will the country suffer? Will you still be able to study?" Under the stern persuasion, some students retreated.

On May 21, five trucks from Jilin Chemical, sent to Beijing's Yanshan Petrochemical Company to transport raw materials, were seized by the "Dare-to-Die Brigade" of the "High Autonomy Federation" and used as roadblocks. The convoy leader, Liu Xin, negotiated with the brigade leader for over four hours. In the dead of night, taking advantage of a moment when a few of the dare-to-die brigade members were intercepting another vehicle, he quickly directed the convoy to return to Jilin on time. Two trucks sent to Shanghai to transport corrosion-resistant materials also successfully navigated through more than a dozen blockades and returned on time. More than 100 supply and marketing personnel working outside the province all completed their tasks successfully. From May to June, Jilin Chemical's output and taxes continued to grow.

Just as the counter-revolutionary rebellion was happening in Beijing in early June, 36,691 workers at Jilin Chemical took the largest technical level exam in the company's history across 22 examination areas and 305 examination rooms. The results showed that over the past decade, the average technical level of Jilin Chemical workers had risen from 3.2 to 5.8.

Li Qisheng, the Party Secretary of Jilin Chemical, said: "The greatest achievement of Jilin Chemical's ten years of reform is the cultivation of a workforce with high political and cultural qualities. In long-term production practice, they have formed a common enterprise spirit, which is the 'spirit of considering the overall situation and shouldering heavy responsibilities as masters,' the 'spirit of striving for gold medals and first places,' the 'spirit of overcoming difficulties and creating businesses with hard work,' and the 'spirit of contributing without comparing rewards.' In summary, it is 'unity, progress, and practicality.' The 100,000 employees of Jilin Chemical, although they have different personalities, interests, and hobbies, and differences in ideology, culture, and customs, all use the 'Jilin Chemical Spirit' to regulate their behavior, and it is especially prominent in critical moments."

From 1982 to 1985, 26 construction teams from across the country gathered in Daqing to install and build a 300,000-ton ethylene project. The 3,000-person construction team from Jilin Chemical won the championship in six engineering evaluations and completed their project successfully on the first attempt. It was rated as a first-class excellent project and a gold project in Heilongjiang Province. In 1987, they went to Benxi Iron and Steel Company to build a 10,000-cubic-meter oxygen separation device, which was evaluated as "high quality, high efficiency, high standards, and iron-willed Jilin Chemical people."

The Xinjiang Fertilizer Plant had been losing money for ten consecutive years. A 32-person professional team from Jilin Chemical went to help solve technical problems, and the plant made a profit of 40 million yuan that year, turning a losing operation into a profitable one. When the Xinjiang Fertilizer Plant wanted to give them a bonus, they said, "We are here to support, not to share profits." They took not a single cent. During the most intense period of the project, the company sent a delegation to comfort them, bringing them audio tapes from their families. When a technician heard his wife singing "The Moon on the Fifteenth Night" thousands of miles away, and a female analyst heard her little daughter's soft instructions, everyone's eyes welled up with tears. They said, "This is more warming to our hearts than a bonus!" The delegation members also brought back a videotape of their work in Xinjiang to Jilin, and after their families watched it, they said, "Wherever Jilin Chemical people go, they make people feel at ease!"

The Owner's Spirit That Money Cannot Buy

At the beginning of the reform, Jilin Chemical faced a mess left by the Cultural Revolution, with only 36% of its equipment in good condition and serious issues of dripping, leaking, running, and emitting. At that time, Jia Qingli, who was sent by the Chemical Industry Department to take charge of Jilin Chemical, told the workers, "The enterprise is our home, and we cannot let our home be dirty!" This veteran of the chemical industry, who was already over sixty at the time, worked and lived in the chemical area for four years, leading all the workers to clean up the factory area, repair equipment, maintain pipelines, check for leaks, and make Jilin Chemical's factories the first batch of leak-free, clean, and civilized factories and six-good enterprises in the country.

In 1983, Jilin Chemical was the first in the national chemical industry to implement the contract responsibility system. Jilin Chemical's contract was not about turning workers into slaves of money, but about using the contract to make workers further realize that they are the masters of the enterprise. "Everyone shares the heavy burden, and everyone has a target on their shoulders." Each worker, cadre, and technician has a clear responsibility to the enterprise and the state, and corresponding rights and interests. "The factory prospers, I am honored; the factory declines, I am ashamed." The fate of the workers is closely tied to that of the enterprise and the state, truly forming a "community of interests."

With the enthusiasm released by the contract and the clear responsibility system, Jilin Chemical vigorously promoted scientific management rather than replacing management with contracting. Jilin Chemical has had a complete set of voluminous rules, regulations, quotas, and standards for a long time, but in the era of eating from the same big pot, they could only be roughly and approximately executed, and enterprise management remained at a rough level. Now, after revision and improvement, and the absorption of modern management methods, they are strictly implemented in the production process at every moment, with the slightest deviation immediately reflected in the day's duty log and dispatch report, and immediately corrected.

Look at the automatic instruments that reflect the workers' operating conditions. The flow line is always a circle, the temperature line is always straight, and the pressure line is always flat, indicating that the equipment is running normally and stably. This is the manifestation of a high sense of responsibility, "first-class work, first-class level." Jilin Chemical's product qualification rate reaches 100%, and the excellent product rate reaches 79%, all created by this high sense of responsibility. The sense of ownership has formed the style of "strict, meticulous, practical, and fast," promoting a high-efficiency operating mechanism, making modern management "all-people, all-aspects, all-processes." Jilin Chemical and its affiliated factories have been awarded by the state and the Chemical Industry Department many times in equipment, safety, measurement, environmental protection, and quality management.

Ideal is the Main Melody

"Nothing is more tragic than a dead heart." A country, a nation, an enterprise, and a person all need ideals and pursuits. This is the driving force for progress. Jilin Chemical pays great attention to educating workers about ideals, inspiring people to strive upward and make continuous progress.

An important feature of Jilin Chemical's ideal education is to combine the distant revolutionary ideal with the enterprise's development goals and workers' duties, advocating for excellence on the job. This is a song about ideals written by workers themselves: "Ideals are distant, yet real; ideals are the sail of life, the painting of reality; ideals are by your side, under your feet; ideals are on your job."

With a grand ideal, one is no longer a short-sighted, money-grubbing petty person. Wu Zhenfu, a senior engineer at the Carbide Plant, has rejected several high-salary job offers worth tens of thousands of yuan, devoting all his energy to the construction of the chemical area. He has completed 30 scientific research projects, earning 40 million yuan, but he does not take more bonuses. He says, "Contributing to the motherland is the greatest happiness. If one pursues money, it devalues the worth of life."

When the newly built Organic Synthesis Plant was put into production and trial operation, more than 1,000 Young Pioneers and young people lived and worked in the factory. More than 500 young people postponed their marriages and family visits, resulting in "high quality, high level, high speed" successful first-time production, receiving praise from their superiors. They believe that participating in the construction of a new plant is a once-in-a-lifetime great event, and missing it would be a lifelong regret. After completing this big event, they will handle their personal marriages and family affairs more sweetly!

With an ideal, the enterprise fundamentally eliminates short-term behavior. Jilin Chemical always puts national interests first, paying more taxes to the state every year and becoming the enterprise that pays the most taxes in Jilin Province. The enterprise's retained profits are mostly used for technological transformation and production development. Since 1981, it has invested 390 million yuan, completing 290 technological transformations, and increasing production value by 2.2 billion yuan. Bonuses are strictly distributed according to standards, and so far, the entire company has accumulated more than 50 million yuan in bonus funds. If all of this were distributed to the workers, each person could get an additional five or six hundred yuan. The people of Jilin Chemical believe that bonuses are necessary, but they are "the fulcrum that lifts a thousand pounds, not the weight on the scale."

Party Members and Cadres as Pioneers

On a winter night in 1986, Jilin City was covered with more than a foot of snow. Wang Qundong, a bulldozer driver at the Dye Plant and a Communist Party member, was awakened by the blizzard at two in the morning. He immediately set out from the city to the factory, drove out the bulldozer, and pushed the snow clean from the main streets leading to the chemical area, opening a dry path for tens of thousands of workers going to work. This old party member, who is in the late stages of cancer, fights the disease by working more. He arrives at the factory one or two hours earlier every day and leaves one or two hours later, doing chores for everyone, such as fetching water, sweeping the floor, heating food, and wiping vehicles. He says, "If one day's work is done for two days, it's like living an extra day."

"One level leads the next, party members and cadres set the example," has become the yeast that forms the "Jilin Chemical Spirit." The code of conduct for Jilin Chemical's party members and cadres is: study first, work first, endure hardships first, and enjoy later.

During the ten years of reform, the leadership of Jilin Chemical has changed several times, but the good traditions have been maintained. Whether in the company, factory, or workshop, 365 days a year, including weekends and holidays, 24 hours a day, there are always leaders on the production front line. Leaders above the factory level work more than ten hours a day, but they do not take an extra penny in bonuses or overtime pay.

The manager of Jilin Chemical Company, Huo Ronghua, works in a small north room of about ten square meters, with a desk from the 1950s. There is no air conditioning, electric fan, or carpet, let alone a sofa, not as good as the office of a township enterprise manager. This national outstanding entrepreneur says, "The strength of an entrepreneur lies in relying on the masses, uniting the masses, and leading the masses. In such a large enterprise, one person can influence 100,000 people. The captain and the crew must work together."

In Jilin Chemical, the tradition of voluntary labor has been maintained. When there are urgent, difficult, dangerous, and heavy tasks, party members and cadres take the lead. On the Sunday of June 4, when the counter-revolutionary rebellion was happening in Beijing, 1,120 party members at the Fertilizer Plant went to the factory to participate in the alkali tower repair. This tower has 200,000 ceramic rings that need to be replaced with new ones, costing 200,000 yuan. The party members cleaned them one by one and worked continuously until June 7, completing the task perfectly and saving a large amount of funds.

A water dam on the banks of the Songhua River collapsed, and the Youth League Committee of the Fertilizer Plant went to the Party Committee to volunteer, handing over this task to the Young Pioneers. A batch of Young Pioneers picked up iron picks and fought for a week, repairing the dam.

Since 1986, Jilin Chemical has generally established a party member responsibility area system, clarifying the six responsibilities of party members: propagating the party's policies and guidelines to the masses; doing mass work; leading the masses to observe discipline; cultivating activists; taking the lead in completing various tasks; and taking the lead in learning technology, forming a united and struggling situation of "one leads one," "one leads two," and "one leads a group."

The 20,000 party members and cadres have become the backbone of cultivating and practicing the "Jilin Chemical Spirit." They have led all the workers to transform and build an old enterprise with outdated equipment into a modernized, nationally largest chemical industry group. In 1988, the company completed a total output value of 2.72 billion yuan and taxes of 1.2 billion yuan, which were 2.38 times and 3.17 times those of 1980, respectively. Among the 174 main products, 93 were rated as department-level and provincial-level excellent products, including 5 gold medals and 11 silver medals from the state. At the same time, it sent more than 20,000 technical workers and cadres to various parts of the country. Jilin Chemical has shown the superiority of socialist enterprises with its excellent results.

　　活力的源泉
　　——记“吉化精神”
    新华社记者　赵玉庆　陈广俊　本报记者　李安达
    被誉为松花江畔一颗明珠的吉林化学工业公司，在改革开放的年代，放出更加绚丽的光彩。这个建于“一五”时期的我国第一座化学工业基地，如今已成为全国十大企业之一。十万吉化职工以“团结、进取、实干”的“吉化精神”，推进了企业的高效率、高效益和现代化，使吉化在全国同行业中实现的利税最多，提供的优质产品最多，连续5年被评为全国思想政治工作优秀企业。
    吉化为什么发展这样快？吉化人说得很形象：“改革是帆，四项基本原则是舵，高高扬起帆，稳稳掌住舵，企业这条船才会快速平稳地行驶。”吉化正是在这种基本思想指导下，坚持思想政治工作与经济工作的有机结合，培育企业精神，推动企业进步，使物质文明建设和精神文明建设协调发展，从而创造了令人瞩目的成绩。
    十万职工的精神支柱
    在今年5月至6月初发生动乱和反革命暴乱的日子里，每天有上千外来人在吉化厂区门口叫喊：“吉化，上街！吉化，罢工！”然而，十万吉化职工没有一个人离岗，没有一个人上街游行，所属几十所学校没有一个班级停课，生产、学习秩序井然。一位老工人劝学生：“你们知道吗？吉化一天的产值上千万元，利税400多万元，要是停产十天半月，国家要受多大损失，你们还能念书吗？”在义正词严的劝说下，一些学生退走了。
    5月21日，吉化去北京燕山石化总公司运原料的5辆汽车被“高自联敢死队”抢去当路障。汽车队队长刘欣和“敢死队”头头周旋了4个多小时，深夜趁几个守夜的敢死队员拦截另一辆汽车之机，指挥车队迅速行动，按时回抵吉林。到上海运耐腐材料的两辆汽车，绕过十几道封锁线，也按时赶回。吉化在外地工作的一百余名供销业务人员都圆满地完成了任务。5月至6月，吉化的产值、利税都持续增长。
    就在6月初北京发生反革命暴乱的时候，吉化36691名工人分别在22个考区305个考场进行了企业创建以来规模最大的一次技术等级考试。结果表明，十年间，吉化工人平均技术等级由3.2级提高到5.8级。
    吉化党委书记李奇生说：“吉化十年改革的最大成绩是培育了一支具有较高政治素质和文化素质的职工队伍。他们在长期的生产实践中形成了共同的企业精神，那就是‘顾全大局、勇挑重担的主人翁精神’，‘夺金牌、争第一的进取精神’，‘知难而上、艰苦创业的实干精神’，‘讲贡献、不比报酬的奉献精神’，概括地说，就是‘团结、进取、实干’。十万吉化职工虽然有着不同的性格、情趣、爱好，存在着思想、文化、习俗上的差异，但是他们在共同的生产活动中，都以‘吉化精神’来规范自己的行为，越是在关键的时刻表现得越突出。”
    1982年至1985年，全国26支建设队伍会师大庆，安装建设30万吨乙烯工程，吉化派去的3000名建设队伍，在6次工程评比中，6次获得冠军，他们担负的工程完工后，一次投产成功，被评为甲级优等工程、黑龙江省的金牌工程。1987年，他们又去本溪钢铁公司建设1万立方米的氧气分离装置，评价是“高质高效高标准，钢筋铁骨吉化人”。
    新疆化肥厂连续十年亏损，吉化派去一个32人的专业队伍，帮助解决技术难题，当年盈利400万元，使这个亏损大户成为盈利大户。新疆化肥厂要给他们提一笔奖金，他们说：“我们是来支援的，不是来分利润的。”分文未取。在攻关最紧张的时候，公司派去的慰问组，带给他们的是亲人们的录音带，当一位技术员听到妻子在远隔几千公里的家乡唱《十五的月亮》，一位女分析工听到小女儿的喃喃嘱托，大家喜泪盈眶。他们说：“这比奖金更能温暖我们的心！”慰问组同志又把他们在新疆工作的录像带回吉林，亲人们看过以后说：“吉化人走到哪里，都让人放心！”
    金钱换不来的主人翁精神
    改革之初，吉化面临的是一个遭受文化大革命浩劫破坏的烂摊子，设备完好率只有36％，滴、漏、跑、冒严重。当时，由化工部派到吉化主持工作的贾庆礼对职工说：“企业是我们全体职工的家，我们不能让自己的家有污泥尘垢！”这位当时已年满六十的化工战线老战士任职4年，吃住在化工区，带领全体职工，分片包干，清理厂区，检修设备，维护管道，检查堵漏，使吉化所属各厂成为全国首批无泄漏工厂、清洁文明工厂和六好企业。
    1983年，吉化在全国化工行业率先实行承包经营责任制。吉化的承包不是把职工变成金钱的奴隶，而是通过承包使职工进一步认识到自己是企业的主人。“千斤重担大家挑，人人肩上有指标”。每个工人、干部、技术人员对企业和国家的责任都是明确的，同时都有相应权力和利益。“厂兴我荣，厂衰我耻”，职工的命运同企业、国家的命运紧紧连在一起，真正形成“利益共同体”。
    吉化以承包中焕发出来的积极性和明确的责任制，大力推进科学化管理，而不是以包代管。吉化早就有成套的、卷帙浩繁的规章、规程、定额、标准，但在职责不清的吃大锅饭年代，只能大致地、约略地被执行，企业管理停留在粗放的水平上。如今，经过修订、完善，并吸收了现代化管理方法，每时每刻、一丝不苟地体现在生产过程中，有丝毫违反立即反映在当天的值班日记、调度报表上，并立即纠正。
    看一看反映工人操作状况的自动仪表吧，流量线始终是一个圆圈，温度线始终是直的，压力线始终是平的，显示设备运行正常、平稳。这是高度责任心表现出的“第一等工作，第一流水平”。吉化产品合格率达到100％、优质品率达到79％，就是靠这种高度责任心创造的。主人翁责任感形成了“严、细、实、快”的作风，推进了高效能的运行机制，使现代化管理能“全员、全面、全过程”地实行。吉化及其所属各厂，在设备、安全、计量、环保、质量管理等方面都多次受到国家和化工部的奖励。
    理想是主旋律
    “哀莫大于心死”。一个国家、一个民族、一个企业、一个人，都要有理想，有追求。这是前进的动力。吉化很注意对职工进行理想教育，激发人们奋发向上，不断进取。
    吉化理想教育一个重要特点是把远大革命理想，同企业的发展目标、职工的本职工作结合起来，提倡岗位成才。这是工人自己编写的《理想之歌》：“理想是遥远的，又是现实的；理想是生活的帆，现实的画；理想在身边、在脚下；理想就在你的岗位上。”
    人有了远大的理想，就不再是一个鼠目寸光、唯利是图的小人。电石厂高级工程师吴振福几次拒绝几万元的高薪聘请，把全部心血投入化工区的建设上，完成30项科研项目，创收400万元，却不多拿奖金，他说：“为祖国贡献力量，是最大幸福。要是为了多赚钱，反而贬低了人生的价值。”
    新建的有机合成厂投产试车时，1000多名团员和青年吃住在工厂，500多名青年推迟婚期和探亲假，结果“高质量、高水平、高速度”地一次投产成功，受到上级嘉奖。他们认为，参加一座新厂投产是永生难忘的大事，错过了会终生遗憾。办完了这件大事，再办个人的婚事、家事，会更甜蜜！
    企业有了理想，就从根本上消除了短期行为。吉化始终把国家利益摆在第一位，上缴给国家的利税一年比一年多，成为吉林省上缴利税最多的企业。企业留利也多数用于技术改造和生产发展，从1981年以来共投资3.9亿元，完成290项技术改造，新增加了2.2亿元产值。奖金严格按标准发放，至今全公司结余了5000多万元奖励基金，如果都分给职工，每人可多得五六百元。吉化人认为，奖金是必要的，但它是“四两拔千斤的砰砣，而不是天平上的砝码”。
    党员和干部做开路先锋
    1986年一个冬夜，吉林市下了一尺多厚的大雪，染料厂推土机司机、共产党员王群东半夜两点被暴风雪惊醒，立即起身从市里赶到工厂，开出推土机，东一趟，西一趟，把通往化工区的主要街道上的雪推净，为成千上万上班的工人开出干爽的路。这位老党员身患癌症，已是晚期，他同病魔搏斗的唯一办法是多做工作，每天都提前到厂一两个小时，又晚走一两个小时，为大家打水、扫地、热饭、擦洗车辆，他说：“要是一天干两天的活，就等于多活一天。”
      “一级带着一级干，党员、干部做模范”，成为形成“吉化精神”的酵母。吉化党员和干部的守则是：学习在前，工作在前，吃苦在前，享受在后。
    改革十年间，吉化领导干部已经换了几届，但是始终保持着好传统。不论公司、厂、车间，一年365天，包括星期天、假日，一天24小时，每时每刻，都有领导干部在生产第一线。厂以上领导干部每天工作十几个小时，但不多拿一分奖金和加班费。
    吉化公司经理霍荣华在一间十几平方米的小北屋办公，办公桌还是50年代留下来的，不要说没有空调、电扇和地毯，连沙发也没有，不如乡镇企业厂长办公室。这位全国优秀企业家说：“企业家的力量在于依靠群众，团结群众，带领群众。在我们这样一个大企业，一个人会影响十万人。船长和船员要同舟共济。”
    在吉化，义务劳动的制度一直在坚持，遇有急、难、险、重的任务，党员和干部带头去干。就在北京发生反革命暴乱的6月4日那个星期天，化肥厂的1120名党员到厂参加碱塔检修。这个塔有20万个瓷环要更换成新的，需20万元，党员们自己动手一个个清洗，一直干到6月7日，圆满完成任务，节约了大量资金。
    松花江畔，一个排水坝塌了，化肥厂团委到党委请战，把这个任务交给团员吧。一批团员扛着铁镐，奋战一周，修复了。
    从1986年开始，吉化普遍建立了党员责任区制度，明确党员的6条责任：向群众宣传党的方针政策；做群众工作；带动群众遵守纪律；培养积极分子；带头完成各项任务；带头学习技术，形成“一带一”、“一带二”、“一带群”的团结奋斗局面。
    2万名党员和干部成为培育和实践“吉化精神”的中坚，他们带领全体职工把一个设备陈旧的老企业改造和建设成为具有现代化水平的全国最大的化工联合集团。1988年，全公司完成总产值27.2亿元，利税12亿元，分别为1980年的2.38倍和3.17倍。在174种主要产品中，有93种被评为部优、省优，其中获国家金质奖章5枚，银质奖章11枚。同时向全国各地输送技术工人和干部2万多名。吉化以自己的优异成绩，显示了社会主义企业的优越性。
