The Scientific and Technological Army Advancing with the Republic

By People's Daily reporter Wang Yougong

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, China's natural science and technology workforce has continuously grown and strengthened. Both in quantity and quality, significant changes have occurred. A growing and powerful force

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "respecting knowledge and respecting talent" has become a firmly established policy of the Party and the state. China's professional and technical workforce has seen tremendous development, and now a force of over 20 million professionals has been established.

Before liberation, China had only 180,000 graduates from institutions of higher learning, and approximately 50,000 scientific and technological personnel. There were even fewer people dedicated to scientific research, with only about 30 research institutions, covering very few fields, and modern scientific research was almost non-existent.

At the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, China's natural science and technology personnel (including engineering, agriculture, health, science, and education) had already increased to over 420,000. According to recent statistics from the State Personnel Department, the country now has 21,824,000 professional and technical personnel of various kinds (including 12,223,000 in public institutions, 8,188,000 in enterprises, and 1,413,000 in government agencies). There are 800,000 senior professional and technical personnel and 5,000,000 intermediate professional and technical personnel. Through the implementation of the professional and technical position appointment system, a large number of professional and technical personnel have had their technical levels and status recognized by society. They strive to make contributions and produce results, playing a very important role in socialist construction.

The largest natural science research institution in the country, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, had only 300 scientific and technical personnel at the end of 1949, including 112 senior researchers. The latest statistics show that the Academy now has over 56,000 professional and technical personnel in more than 100 units, including 12,000 senior researchers, which is over 100 times the number at the time of its establishment. At the time of the liberation of the mainland, the Nationalist government's agricultural research institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were few and far between. By 1988, there were over 1,130 independent agricultural research institutions nationwide, with over 120,000 employees, including 35,000 scientists and engineers.

China's scientific and technological strength is advantageous among developing countries and poses a significant challenge to developed countries. They all have a strong patriotic spirit.

Academician Zhao Zhongyao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is one of the scientists who first observed the production of positron-electron pairs in the world. When the first five-star red flag of New China was raised over Tiananmen Square, he was on the other side of the ocean. The burning love for the republic urged him to return to his homeland as soon as possible. He said, "An individual's achievements abroad can only bring personal glory. To improve the scientific and cultural level of the entire Chinese nation and achieve national prosperity, one must return to the country and practice what one preaches." To provide the republic with an accelerator for nuclear physics experiments, he spent several years traveling around to purchase all the necessary equipment for installing an accelerator. However, on his way back to the country, he was arrested and imprisoned for the crime of "carrying 'atomic secrets' back to communist China." Facing the threat of death, he did not change his patriotic resolve and, after struggling, finally returned to the embrace of his motherland. He led the construction of China's first proton electrostatic accelerator and trained a group of talents for China's nuclear industry. In the early days of the founding of the nation, there were many scientists like Zhao Zhongyao who returned to the country without hesitation. Many of them became pioneers in China's scientific field and were respected as leaders in their disciplines.

After China successfully synthesized bovine insulin artificially for the first time in the world in 1966, a group of young scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University began research on the crystal structure of porcine insulin. However, the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution made their research impossible to continue peacefully. But to ensure that China did not fall behind in this research, even when the loudspeakers of the rebels shook the experimental instruments and big-character posters covered the windows of the workrooms, they continued to delve into their research. Uninterrupted exploration finally brought about a "miracle"—in the midst of the decade of turmoil, when many of China's disciplines fell behind the world, their research was able to remain at the forefront of the field and compete with foreign counterparts.

Since 1978, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has sent over 6,000 visiting scholars, trainees, and graduate students to 34 countries and regions. By the beginning of 1987, nearly 4,000 had returned to the country after completing their studies. Even after the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing in early June this year, a considerable number of students resolutely returned to the country on time. This reflects the patriotism of Chinese intellectuals and their dedication to the people's cause.

Effective measures promote the rapid growth of talent

The development of China's scientific and technological workforce, which shares the same destiny as the People's Republic, has not been smooth sailing. The decade of turmoil caused a gap in China's scientific and technological workforce. To minimize this loss, after the Gang of Four was smashed, Comrade Deng Xiaoping first proposed the timely restoration of the college entrance examination system for selecting the best and proposed to turn a number of key universities into centers for both education and research. The development of scientific research in institutions of higher learning has greatly promoted the cultivation of talent.

Over the past decade, a series of reform measures on the scientific and technological front by the state have effectively promoted the development and growth of the scientific and technological workforce.

The implementation of the degree system since 1981 has further stimulated the enthusiasm of a large number of young scientific and technological workers, educators, and aspiring young people in various fields to study diligently and strive to reach the peak of science and technology. A large number of outstanding young scientific and technological talents have rapidly emerged. The emergence of a group of young academic leaders and backbones has somewhat alleviated the "gap" caused by the decade of turmoil.

By the end of 1988, China had awarded over 110,000 master's degrees and over 2,900 doctoral degrees, exceeding the number of doctoral students who studied abroad and returned to the country during the same period. This marks a new stage in the development of high-level specialized talent in China.

The establishment of a number of open-type national key laboratories is another significant event in the cultivation of scientific and technological talent in China over the past decade. Since 1984, the state has invested in the construction of dozens of high-level laboratories in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and institutions of higher learning, covering a significant portion of the frontier and interdisciplinary fields in basic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and biology, as well as important fields such as agriculture, energy, transportation, communications, machinery, electronics, new materials, medicine, and environmental protection.

High-level research work has improved the quality of researchers and the quality of talent cultivation. In the past five years, the 37 national key laboratories established in institutions of higher learning alone have produced over 2,000 academic papers and sent nearly 1,000 master's and doctoral students to research and production departments each year.

To strengthen the depth of scientific development and ensure the stable development of basic research, the National Natural Science Foundation was established to provide equal opportunities and a broad space for competition and activity for talented individuals with expertise nationwide. In the past three years, nearly 400 million yuan has been allocated, supporting approximately 10,000 projects and nearly 100,000 individuals. The establishment of the Youth Science Fund and the selective support for national youth academic exchanges and youth scientific education activities have created favorable conditions for the growth of China's scientific and technological reserve forces and for outstanding young scientific workers to stand out.

Since 1984, the practice of "prioritizing the improvement of the treatment of outstanding middle-aged and young scientific, technological, and managerial experts" approved by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council has further embodied the Party and the state's care and respect for outstanding talents in both material and spiritual terms. Over the years, three batches of national-level experts with outstanding contributions totaling over 2,200 have been selected. Among them are those who have made major inventions, those who have made significant achievements in basic scientific research, and those who have made outstanding contributions in the management of major projects.

    同共和国一起前进的科技大军
    本报记者  王友恭
    建国40年来，我国自然科学技术队伍不断发展壮大。不管在数量上还是在质量上都发生了巨大的变化。一支日益壮大的队伍
    建国40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，“尊重知识、尊重人才”已成为党和国家的一项既定国策，我国的专业技术队伍得到了很大发展，现在已建立起一支2000多万人的专业技术大军。
    解放前，我国高等学校毕业生仅18万，科技人员约5万人。专门从事科学研究的人员更少得可怜，科研机构只有30余个，涉及领域很少，现代科技研究几乎是空白。
    第一个五年计划刚开始时，我国自然科学技术人员（包括工程、农、卫、科、教）已增加到42万多人。据国家人事部最近的统计，全国已有各类专业技术人员2182.4万人（其中事业单中有1222.3万，企业中有818.8万，机关中有141.3万）。全国有高级职称的专业技术人员80万人，中级专业职称的500万人。通过推行专业技术职务聘任制，一大批专业技术人员的技术水平和地位得到了社会的承认。他们争做贡献、多出成果，在社会主义建设中发挥着十分重要的作用。
    全国最大的自然科学研究机构——中国科学院，在1949年底建院时仅有科学技术人员300名，其中高级研究人员112人。而最新统计表明，该院100多个单位中已有专业技术人员5.6万人，其中高级研究人员1.2万人，为建院之初的100多倍。全国大陆解放时，国民党政府农林部所属的农业科研机构寥寥无几。而到1988年，全国独立农业科研机构已发展到1130多个，拥有职工12万多人，其中科学家、工程师3.5万多人。
    中国的科技力量，在发展中国家具有优势，就是对发达国家也具备了不可忽视的挑战能力。他们都有强烈的爱国之心
    中国科学院学部委员赵忠尧是世界上最早观察到正负电子对产生的科学家之一。当新中国的第一面五星红旗在天安门前升起的时候，他正在大洋彼岸。炽热的共和国之恋催他早日登程返回祖国。他说：“一个人在国外做出成绩只能给自己带来荣誉，要提高整个中华民族的科学文化水平，实现国家富强，还得回国身体力行。”为了给共和国提供一台可以进行核物理试验用的加速器，他前后花了好几年时间到处奔波，终于购齐了可以安装一台加速器的必需器材。然而，他在返国途中却以“携带
  ‘原子秘密’回共产党中国”罪，被捕入狱。在死神的威胁面前他不改爱国之志，经过斗争终于回到了祖国的怀抱。他主持造出了我国第一台质子静电加速器，培养出一批为我国的核事业作贡献的人才。建国初期，像赵忠尧这样义无反顾、返回祖国的科学家为数可观。他们中不少人都成为我国科学园地的开拓者，被人们尊崇的学科泰斗。
    继1966年我国在世界上第一次成功地人工合成牛胰岛素之后，中国科学院和北京大学的一批青年科学工作者开始了猪胰岛素晶体结构测定的研究。然而，“文化革命”的狂风恶浪使他们的研究再无安宁之地。但为了使中国人在这项研究中不落人后，即便造反派的喇叭声震动着实验仪器，大字报糊严了工作间的窗玻璃，他们照样潜心钻研。不间断的探索终于换来了“奇迹”——在十年动乱中，我国许多学科与世界水平差距拉大的情况下，他们的研究却能一直处于该学科的前沿，与国外同行相匹敌。
    中国科学院从1978年以来先后向34个国家和地区派出访问学者、进修人员和研究生6000余人，到1987年初，学成回国的已近4000人。即便在今年6月初北京发生反革命暴乱之后，也有相当一批留学生毅然按时返回祖国。这正反映了中国知识分子热爱社会主义祖国、献身于人民事业的情怀。
    得力的措施促进人才迅速成长
    和人民共和国同命运的我国科技队伍，它的发展当然也不是一帆风顺的。十年动乱造成了我国科技队伍的断层。为了最大限度地弥补这个损失，粉碎“四人帮”后，邓小平同志首先提出及时恢复高考择优录取制度，并提出要把一批重点大学办成教育和科研两个中心。高等院校科研工作的发展有力地促进了人才培养。
    近10年来，国家在科技战线的一系列改革措施，有效地促进了科技队伍的发展壮大。
    从1981年正式开始实施的学位制进一步激发了广大青年科技工作者、教育工作者和各行各业的有志青年刻苦攻读、攀登科技高峰。一大批优秀地青年科技人才迅速地成长起来。一批年轻的学术带头人和骨干的涌现，使十年动乱所造成的“断层”现象有了一定程度的缓解。
    到1988年底，我国已授予硕士学位11万多人，授予博士学位2900多人，超过同期在国外学成回国的博士生人数。这标志我国高级专门人才的培养发展到了一个新的阶段。
    一批开放型国家重点实验室的建立，是近10年来我国科技人才培养工作中又一项带有战略意义的大事。1984年以来，国家集中投资在中国科学院、产业部门和高等院校建立的数十个高水平的实验室，覆盖了数理化天地生等基础学科和农业、能源、交通、通信、机械、电子、新材料、医学、环保等重要领域的相当大一部分前沿和边缘交叉学科。
    高水平的研究工作提高了研究人员的素质和人才培养的质量。近5年来，仅在高等院校中建立的37个国家重点实验室就已推出学术论文2000多篇，每年都为科研和生产部门输送近千名硕士、博士。
    为加强科学发展的纵深配置，保证基础研究的稳定发展而设立的国家自然科学基金制度为全国学有专长的人才成长提供了平等竞争的机会和广阔的活动空间。3年来发放基金近4亿元，先后择优资助约一万个项目、近10万人次。青年科学基金的设立和有选择地资助全国性青年学术交流、青少年科学教育活动，为我国科技后备力量的成长和优秀青年科学工作者脱颖而出创造了方便条件。
    1984年以来，经中共中央书记处决议、国务院同意的“优先提高有突出贡献的中青年科学、技术、管理专家待遇”的做法，更是从物质到精神上体现了党和国家对有突出贡献的专门人才的爱护与尊重。几年来，已先后三批评出国家级有突出贡献的专家2200多人。他们中有重大发明的获得者，有在基础科学研究中摘取皇冠上明珠的人，也有在大工程的管理工作中成绩卓著者。
