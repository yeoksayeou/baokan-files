Iranian lawmakers today issued a statement strongly condemning U.S. congressional calls for the U.S. government to support Iranian opposition groups as "interference in Iran's internal affairs."

According to a broadcast by Tehran Radio, the statement was issued during the opening session of the Iranian parliament today.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi said in the opening session, "The People's Mujahedin of Iran" is a "terrorist organization," and U.S. support for this organization is a "reckless and foolish act."

"The People's Mujahedin of Iran" is a guerrilla group that seeks to overthrow the current Iranian government through bombings and assassinations.

The group's headquarters was originally located in France but was expelled and is now based in Iraq.
