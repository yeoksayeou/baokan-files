Li Peng and Song Ping, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, visited universities to offer encouragement and hold talks. Li Peng emphasized at Beijing Normal University that cultivating morally and intellectually excellent talents is the primary task. Song Ping pointed out at Peking University that the construction of the Party organization and its members in universities must be strengthened.

Newspaper reporters He Ping and Zhang Su Tang reported from Beijing on September 9 that Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, pointed out during a talk with teachers and students at Beijing Normal University this morning that the primary task in educational work, especially in higher education, is to solve the problem of what kind of people to cultivate. The students we cultivate should first have a firm and correct political direction and at the same time have a qualified professional level.

On the eve of Teachers' Day, Li Peng, along with Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Luo Gan, Secretary-General of the State Council, and He Dongchang, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, visited Beijing Normal University to extend greetings and warm wishes to the teachers and students on the occasion of the festival and held a talk with some teachers and students.

The talk was presided over by Fang Fukan, President of Beijing Normal University.

Program Shuli, Zeng Yiyue, Zhou Meike, Wang Zongqing, Yuan Xingzhen, Tao Dazong, He Yunqing, Cheng Zhengfang, Wang Yue, Jiang Lu, Yu Runhu, Gong Shutiao, Ma Xiaodong, and Gu Mingyuan from Beijing Normal University spoke at the meeting. They introduced the work, study, and ideological situation of the teachers and students, reflected the existing problems, and expressed their opinions on how to further run a socialist university, cultivate morally and intellectually excellent talents, and better develop China's educational cause.

After listening to the teachers and students' speeches, Li Peng spoke on the issues raised by everyone.

Li Peng said that in the 40 years since liberation, educational work has achieved great results, but there are also many problems. The overall educational cause is still relatively backward, one of the reasons being that during the process of social development, the state and local governments have invested relatively little in education, and teachers' remuneration is low. In the future, we must strive to improve these conditions. It should be seen that education is a long-term plan that relates to the overall improvement of the nation's quality. The development of education, of course, has a significant promoting effect on economic development, but the development of education is also necessarily constrained by the level of economic development. We are a developing country and can only gradually increase investment in education according to China's level of economic development.

Li Peng said that there are indeed many problems to be solved in the current development of education, but the first thing to address is the question of what kind of people to cultivate. We want to build a socialist motherland and change the face of poverty and backwardness. The people we cultivate must consciously serve this cause, have a firm and correct political direction, love their country, love their party, and love their people. At the same time, they must be qualified in their profession and studies, and excel in both moral and academic aspects.

Li Peng said that in the past, many college graduates were assigned to work in state organs immediately after graduation. Practice has proven that this approach needs to be improved. We advocate that young students first go to grassroots units and practice in real-world settings, of course, as much as possible in combination with their major. This is different from the previous "Up to the Mountains, Down to the Countryside" policy. An important path for college students to succeed is to go to practice to enhance their abilities, gain social knowledge in practice, and deepen their emotional connection with the working people.

When discussing the issue of sending people to study abroad, Li Peng said that we should continue to send people abroad and improve the process. Our policy is to send people abroad as needed, ensure quality, and align learning with use. In the future, we will strengthen the management of sending people to study abroad and pay attention to selecting politically mature individuals with a certain level of professional competence to study and further their education abroad.

He also reiterated that the line, principles, and policies since the 13th Party Congress have not changed. In the fields of education and scientific research, we will continue to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," allowing discussions on various academic issues under the premise of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles.

Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, visited Peking University this afternoon to participate in the Teachers' Day talk with teachers, extend greetings to the teachers on the occasion of the festival, and had a cordial exchange with the teachers on topics such as Party building, policies for intellectuals, and how to run Peking University well. Chen Xitong, State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, also visited Peking University.

At the picturesque Xianhu Xuan reception room by the Weiming Lake, Song Ping and nearly 40 professors, associate professors, lecturers, assistant lecturers, and department heads from this famous university gathered for an intimate and sincere exchange.

During the talk, professors Chen Shouliang, Wang Chu, Wang Yiqiu, Cheng Hanchang, Wu Jilan, Zhang Qiang, Shi Defu, Chen Jiahou, Liang Zhu, and Jin Kaicheng from Peking University spoke. They combined the actual situation of Peking University to express their opinions on issues such as strict Party governance, Party building in universities, policies for intellectuals, and cultivating successors to the socialist cause.

Song Ping spoke at the meeting. He said that the annual Teachers' Day is approaching. Everyone has worked hard for a year. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I would like to extend holiday greetings to all the teachers and staff of Peking University.

He said that our Party is the ruling party. To solve China's problems, we must rely on the Communist Party. As long as we build a good Party, many problems will be easier to solve. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the new central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has attached great importance to Party building and has done a lot of work. Recently, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has also issued the "Notice of the Central Committee on Strengthening Party Building." Now, Party organizations at all levels are strengthening Party building, and the atmosphere of the whole Party focusing on Party building has been formed.

He said that universities are important bases for cultivating people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline who are successors to the socialist cause. To run universities well, the Party organizations and Party members in universities have a heavy responsibility. We must seize the current favorable opportunity, seriously summarize and reflect on the experiences and lessons of Party building in universities, and build a good Party organization and Party member team in universities.

Song Ping said that in recent years, many Communist Party members have had a weak sense of Party identity. Through education, we must make every Party member firmly establish the concept of the Party, and no matter what work they do or in what situation, they must not forget that they are Communist Party members.

Song Ping emphasized that strengthening Party building requires eliminating negative and corrupt phenomena within the Party and maintaining close ties between the Party and the people. The Central Committee has decided to address seven issues in the near future, demonstrating the Central Committee's resolve. The Central Committee has taken the lead, and all levels have taken action. As long as each level takes responsibility and persists in addressing the issue, the negative and corrupt phenomena within the Party can be solved.

He said that during the turmoil and riots, many university teachers stood firmly with the Party and the people. Some teachers, due to the complex situation at the time, did not fully understand and said or did some wrong things. These comrades, as long as they have a clear understanding, are fine and should not carry any burdens. The Party will continue to trust them. Please believe that the Party's assessment of the intellectual community and the Party's policy towards intellectuals will not change because of this turmoil and riot, and will not change in the future. Intellectuals are part of the working class and are also a reliable force for building socialist modernization.

Song Ping said that young people are the future and hope of our country. We must strengthen the education of young people to make them understand the national conditions. In our country with a population of 1.1 billion, the economy is not yet developed. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and by following the socialist path can China develop and have hope.

Song Ping finally said that Peking University is a famous university known both domestically and internationally, with a glorious history and tradition, and has played an important role in spreading Marxism. The Party Central Committee has great expectations for Peking University. The students cultivated by Peking University should be politically firm and professionally competent successors to the socialist cause. The Communist Party members working at Peking University have a heavy responsibility. They must strictly require themselves, work hard, unite the masses, and strive together to run Peking University well.

Relevant department heads He Dongchang, Wang Jiamiao, Teng Teng, Liu Ze Peng, and Lu Yucheng participated in the talk. The talk lasted three and a half hours. (Accompanying photo)

    李鹏在北师大强调培养德才兼备人才是首要任务
    宋平在北大指出要把高校党组织党员队伍建设好
    新华社北京9月9日电  （记者何平）中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏今天上午在同北京师范大学师生座谈时指出，教育工作，特别是高等院校的教育工作，第一位的是解决好培养什么人的问题。我们培养出来的学生首先应该具有坚定正确的政治方向，同时具有合格的业务水平。
    在教师节前夕，李鹏和中共中央政治局委员、国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映，中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭，国务院秘书长罗干，国家教委副主任何东昌等同志一起，专程到北京师范大学向师生们表示节日的祝贺和亲切的慰问，并同部分师生员工进行了座谈。
    座谈会由北师大校长方福康主持。
    北师大的师生程树礼、曾贻伟、周美珂、王宗清、袁行榘、陶大镛、贺允清、程正方、王跃、姜璐、于润瑚、龚书铎、马晓东、顾明远等，先后在座谈会上发言。他们在发言中介绍了师生们的工作、学习和思想状况，反映了当前存在的问题，并就如何进一步办好社会主义的大学，培养德才兼备的合格人才，更好地发展我国的教育事业等问题发表了意见。
    听了师生们的发言后，李鹏同志就大家提出的一些问题讲了话。
    李鹏说，解放40年来，教育工作成绩很大，但问题也不少。教育事业总的来说还比较落后，原因之一就是我们在社会发展过程中，国家、地方对教育的投入比较少，教师的待遇偏低，今后我们要致力于改善这方面的条件。应当看到，教育是百年大计，关系到整个民族素质的提高，教育的发展当然对经济发展有重大的促进作用，但教育的发展也必然受到经济发展水平的制约。我们是发展中国家，只能根据我国经济发展的水平，逐步增加对教育的投入。
    李鹏说，当前在教育发展上确实有许多问题需要解决，但摆在第一位的是培养什么人的问题。我们要建设社会主义祖国，改变贫穷落后的面貌，培养出来的人就要自觉地为这一事业服务，要有坚定正确的政治方向，要热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的党，热爱自己的人民。同时，业务上、学习上是合格的，品学兼优的。
    李鹏说，过去许多大学生一毕业就分配到国家机关工作，实践证明，这种做法需要改进。我们主张青年学生首先到基层单位，到实践中去锻炼，当然应当尽可能地与其所学专业相结合，不是简单地进行体力劳动，这同过去搞的“上山下乡”政策是不同的。大学生的成才之路很重要的一条，是到实践中去增长才干，在实践中增长社会知识，增进与劳动群众的感情。
    在谈到派遣出国留学人员问题时，李鹏说，一是要继续派遣，二是要加以改进。我们的方针是，按需派遣，保证质量，学用一致。今后对派遣出国留学工作要加强管理，要注意选派那些政治上比较成熟又有一定业务水平的人出国学习、进修。
    他在讲话中还重申，党的十三大以来的路线、方针、政策不变。在教育、科研领域还要继续贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，允许对各种学术问题展开讨论。
    新华社北京9月9日电　（记者张宿堂）中共中央政治局常委宋平受党中央、国务院的委托，今天下午来到北京大学，参加北京大学教师节座谈会，向教师们祝贺节日，并就党的建设、知识分子政策、如何办好北京大学等话题同教师们进行了亲切的交谈。同时前往北大的还有国务委员、北京市市长陈希同。
    在未名湖畔风景秀丽的临湖轩接待室，宋平等和这所著名的高等学府的近40名教授、副教授、讲师、助教、校系负责人聚集一堂，促膝谈心，坦诚交流。
    座谈会上，北大教师陈守良、王楚、王义遒、成汉昌、吴季兰、张强、施德福、陈嘉厚、梁柱、金开诚等发了言。他们结合北大的实际，就从严治党、高校党的建设、知识分子政策和培养社会主义事业接班人等问题发表了意见。
    宋平在座谈会上讲了话。他说，一年一度的教师节来临了。大家辛勤劳动了一年，我代表党中央、国务院向北大的全体教职员工表示节日的问候。
    他说，我们的党是执政党，解决中国的问题，必须靠共产党，只要把党建设好了，很多问题就好解决。党的十三届四中全会以来，以江泽民同志为核心的新的中央领导集体，高度重视党的建设，做了许多工作。最近，中央政治局又通过了《中央关于加强党的建设的通知》。现在各级党组织都在加强党的建设，全党抓党建的大气候已经形成。
    他说，高等学校是培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义事业接班人的重要基地。办好高校，高校的党组织和党员责任重大。要抓住当前的有利时机，认真总结和反思高校党的建设的经验教训，把高校的党组织和党员队伍建设好。
    宋平说，这几年，不少共产党员党的观念淡薄了。要通过教育，使每个党员都牢固树立党的观念，无论做什么工作，在什么情况下，都不要忘记自己是一个共产党员。
    宋平强调，加强党的建设，要清除党内的消极、腐败现象，密切党和群众的联系。中央决定近期办7件事，表明了中央的决心。中央带了头，各级也行动起来了，只要一级抓一级，坚持不懈地抓，党内的消极腐败问题是可以解决的。
    他说，动乱暴乱中，不少高校教师旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，同党和人民站在一边。也有一些教师由于当时情况复杂，一时认识不清，说了一些错话，做了一些错事。这些同志只要认识清楚了就好，不要背包袱，党仍将一如既往地信任他们。请同志们相信，党对知识分子队伍的估计和党的知识分子政策，决不会因这次动乱暴乱而改变，今后也不会改变。知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，也是建设社会主义现代化的依靠力量。
    宋平说，青年是我国的未来和希望。要加强对青年的教育，使他们认识我国的国情。在我们这样一个有着11亿人口的大国，经济还不发达，只有在共产党的领导下，走社会主义道路，中国才能发展，才有希望。
    宋平最后说，北大是国内外闻名的高等学府，有着光荣的历史和传统，曾经对传播马克思主义，起了重要作用。党中央对北大寄予很大的希望。北大培养出来的学生，应当是政治上坚定、业务上过硬的社会主义事业的可靠接班人。工作在北大的共产党员，任重道远，要在各自的岗位上，严格要求，努力工作，团结群众，为办好北大而共同奋斗。
    有关部门的负责人何东昌、汪家镠、滕藤、刘泽彭、陆宇澄等参加了座谈会。座谈会历时3个半小时。（附图片）
