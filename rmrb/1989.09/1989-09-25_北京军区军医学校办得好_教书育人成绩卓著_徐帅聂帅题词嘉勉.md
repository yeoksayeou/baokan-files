Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 24th.

The Beijing Military Region Medical School has been dedicated to cultivating politically steadfast and technically proficient medical personnel. Their educational achievements have earned them the National Teaching Achievement Award (First Class) from the military. Recently, Marshals Xu Xiangqian and Nie Rongzhen both inscribed words of encouragement. Marshal Xu's inscription reads: "The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the country, the foundation of the military, and also the foundation of the school." Marshal Nie's inscription reads: "Inherit the revolutionary tradition and carry forward the spirit of Norman Bethune."

The predecessor of the Beijing Military Region Medical School was the Norman Bethune School, established in 1939. It is one of the earliest medical schools in the PLA. Over the past 50 years, the school has adhered to the principle of serving the revolutionary war and the construction of the army through education, cultivating tens of thousands of medical personnel. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the school improved its teaching methods, integrating education with ideological cultivation. Using diverse forms of political theory education and revolutionary tradition education, they helped students establish a spirit of patriotism and a mindset of wholeheartedly serving the people. They also combined classroom education with extracurricular ideological and political work, guiding students to resist the influence of bourgeois liberalization. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the more than 400 graduating students who were interning in Beijing and other places, along with over a thousand students, did not participate in or support the unrest. According to a survey of 1,100 graduates in recent years, the vast majority are competent in their jobs, dedicated to grassroots and border posts, with one-third achieving academic and research results, and one-quarter receiving commendations. The army and hospitals praise them as reliable and trustworthy talents who can be retained.

    北京军区军医学校办得好
    教书育人成绩卓著
    徐帅聂帅题词嘉勉
    新华社北京9月24日电  （记者赵苏、通讯员张其国）北京军区军医学校着力培养政治坚定、技术精良的医务人才，他们的办学经验获得国家教学成果军队级一等奖。徐向前、聂荣臻元帅最近分别题词给予嘉勉。徐帅的题词是：“四项基本原则是立国之本建军之本也是建校之本”。聂帅的题词是：“继承革命传统，发扬白求恩精神”。
    北京军区军医学校的前身是白求恩学校，创建于1939年，是我军最早的医校之一。50年来，这所学校坚持教学为革命战争服务、为部队建设服务的方针，培养造就了数以万计的医务人才。党的十一届三中全会以后，学校改进教学，把教书与育人统一起来，运用形式多样的政治理论教育和革命传统教育，帮助学员树立爱国主义精神和全心全意为人民服务的思想。他们还把课堂教育和课外的思想政治工作结合起来，引导学员清除资产阶级自由化思潮的影响。在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，这个学校在北京等地实习的400多名毕业学员和千余名在校生，无一人参与或声援。据学校对近几年毕业的1100名学员的调查表明，绝大多数胜任本职工作，安心基层、边防，有1／3的人取得了学术和科研成果，1／4的人立了功。部队和医院赞扬他们是“用得上，信得过，留得住”的人才。
