A major research achievement, unprecedented in both scale and quality in the global medical community, the "China 7 Provinces 1 City Study on Acute Diarrhea in Children," has recently been approved by experts from China and abroad in Beijing.

Diarrheal disease is a common and frequently occurring illness among children in China, second only to respiratory infections. There are 80 million children under the age of 5 in China, and on average, 160 million cases of diarrhea occur nationwide each year.

In response to the combined risk factors that trigger diarrhea in children, this groundbreaking study has, for the first time, proposed a comprehensive prevention method characterized by controlling combined risk factors, which is economical, simple, and practical, and tailored to China's specific conditions. After three years of implementation in seven demonstration counties across seven provinces, the results have been highly satisfactory.

    防治小儿急性腹泻
    我国取得重要成果
    本报北京讯　记者艾笑报道：一项规模和质量在世界医学界都属空前的科研成果——“中国7省1市小儿急性腹泻研究”，最近在北京通过中外专家鉴定。
    腹泻病在中国小儿中是仅次于呼吸道感染的常见多发病。我国5岁以下小儿有8000万，全国平均每年有1.6亿人次患腹泻病。
    针对诱发小儿腹泻的联合危险因素，这项前所未有的研究首次提出了以控制联合危险因素为主、具有中国特色的经济简单易行的综合预防方法。经7省7个示范县历时3年的实施，取得十分满意的效果。
