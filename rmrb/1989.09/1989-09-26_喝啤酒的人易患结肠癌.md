According to a report in the *Lancet* magazine, a medical study in Japan has found that people who drink beer every day have a 12 times higher risk of developing sigmoid colon cancer compared to those who do not drink alcohol.

Japan conducted a 17-year study on 265,000 people over the age of 40 and found a clear link between alcohol consumption and sigmoid colon cancer. The study also found that regular drinkers have a 4 times higher risk of developing sigmoid colon cancer compared to non-drinkers.
