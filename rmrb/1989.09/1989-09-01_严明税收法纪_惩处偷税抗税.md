In recent years, many "freelance" actors, individual business owners, and employees of state-owned and collective enterprises have been severely evading taxes.

To change this situation, I suggest that the State Council set a final deadline for annual tax payments. Those who fail to pay taxes by this deadline should be subject to heavy fines, and serious cases should be resolutely handled according to law. I suggest that procuratorial organs at all levels proactively select typical cases of tax evasion and resistance, initiate investigations, and prosecute them. I also suggest that the standing committees of people's congresses at all levels strengthen their supervision over judicial organs in accordance with the law, helping them to eliminate interference in the handling of tax evasion, tax fraud, and tax resistance cases, thereby upholding the dignity of socialist law.

    严明税收法纪　惩处偷税抗税
    近年来，不少“走穴”的演员、个体户、国营和集体企业偷漏税款严重。
    为了改变这种状况，我建议国务院规定每年纳税的最后时限，逾期不纳税者将课以重罚，严重的坚决依法处理。建议各级检察机关主动选择偷税、抗税典型，立案侦查，提起公诉，并请新闻单位予以公布。建议各级人民代表大会常委会依法加强对司法机关的监督，帮助他们排除在查处偷税、漏税、抗税案件中的干扰，以维护社会主义法律的尊严。
