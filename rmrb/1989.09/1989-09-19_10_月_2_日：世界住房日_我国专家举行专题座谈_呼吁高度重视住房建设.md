	World Habitat Day is on October 2.
	Chinese experts hold a special symposium
	Urging high attention to housing construction

	Xinhua News Agency reports: "Housing is a major issue facing all of humanity and should be given the same importance as a fundamental national policy." To welcome this year's World Habitat Day, the Chinese Committee for the International Day of Habitat held a symposium on urban housing issues on September 15. Experts attending the symposium discussed various opinions on how to solve China's housing problems and issued the above appeal.

	In the past 40 years of New China, the cumulative investment in housing has been 25.56 billion yuan, with a total of 1.772 billion square meters of urban housing built. The achievements of the past 10 years have been particularly remarkable, with more than 1 billion square meters of housing completed each year. China's urban per capita living space has increased from 4.5 square meters in 1949 to over 6 square meters in 1988. However, the current urban housing, both in quantity and quality, still cannot meet the needs of the people. According to statistics, there are still over 8 million households in urban areas that lack housing.

	The United Nations General Assembly decided on December 27, 1985, that the first Monday of every October would be World Habitat Day. This year's World Habitat Day falls on October 2, with the theme being "Housing, Health, and Family."

　　10月2日：世界住房日
　　我国专家举行专题座谈
　　呼吁高度重视住房建设
    本报讯　记者朱剑红报道：“住房问题是全人类都面临的重大问题，应该把住房提到基本国策的高度来重视”。为迎接今年世界住房日的到来，国际住房日中国组委会9月15日召开了城镇住房问题座谈会。与会的住房问题专家们就如何解决我国人民住房等问题提出了各种意见，并发出上述呼吁。
    新中国40年累计住宅投资为2556亿元，城镇共建住宅17.72亿平方米。近10年成绩尤为显著，每年建成住宅均在1亿平方米以上。我国城镇人均居住水平从1949年的4.5平方米提高到1988年的6平方米以上。但目前城市住宅无论在数量上还是在质量上，都还不能满足人民需要。据统计，目前城镇还有800多万缺房户。
    联合国大会于1985年12月27日决定，每年10月的第一个星期一为世界住房日。今年的世界住房日是10月2日，主题是住房、健康和家庭。
