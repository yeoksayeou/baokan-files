“Self-reliance and hard work—the Yan'an spirit is not outdated. In the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, we must carry forward the Yan'an spirit; in the primary stage of socialism, we also cannot do without the Yan'an spirit. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for us to build socialism.” This is what General Secretary Jiang Zemin emphasized repeatedly during his inspection of Yan'an.

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, with the concern and greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the people of Yan'an and the old revolutionary base areas, visited the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, where Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee lived and fought for ten years. Here, the General Secretary listened to reports on the work of Yan'an region and Yan'an city; inspected the rural areas on the outskirts of Yan'an city; and paid respects to the former residences and revolutionary sites of Mao Zedong and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries.

When talking about the purpose of his visit to Yan'an, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said: On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I wanted to go to other places to conduct some investigations and research. When considering where to go, I naturally thought of the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. The people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi made great sacrifices and contributions to the cause of the Chinese revolution during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. Many outstanding leaders and cadres of our Party and state were trained in Yan'an. We should not forget the past, and we should not forget the people of the old base areas. Yan'an is located in the Loess Plateau, with poor natural conditions, and for many years, due to various reasons, it has been relatively poor. This time, I came to Yan'an to convey the concern and greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the people of Yan'an. By visiting the people of Yan'an, I convey the warm regards of the Party and the government to the people of the old base areas across the country.

General Secretary Jiang Zemin paid great attention to the lives of the people in the old base areas of Yan'an. He inspected both the households in Yan'an city that have already become prosperous and those that are relatively poor. In the already prosperous Zaoyuan Township Miaogou Village, the General Secretary climbed a hill to see the collective orchard with branches laden with fruit, and visited the cave dwelling of farmer He Juting, who has an income of over 10,000 yuan. In the relatively poor Wanhua Township Xiangyang Village, the General Secretary sat on the kang (traditional heated bed) with the poor farmer Hu Jinhai and chatted with him. When he heard that this farmer and his two sons all had eye diseases, making it difficult for them to work and live in poverty, the General Secretary instructed the village secretary Sun Wenyi to support and help him more. Under the big tree outside the cave, Sun Wenyi reported to the General Secretary their village's determination to become prosperous, saying: “If you support us, we will become prosperous faster; if you do not support us, we will still work hard, it's just that we will become prosperous slower.” The General Secretary said after hearing this, “Your plan is good, it is important to have a spirit of self-reliance. Of course, the state will also support you and help you become prosperous and prosperous as soon as possible.”

The General Secretary paid special attention to inspecting and understanding the local agricultural production in Yan'an. After listening to the reports of Yan'an region and Yan'an city, he said, “The idea of taking agriculture as the foundation must not be forgotten. People live by food. Otherwise, the food problem for our 11 billion people will be a big problem. At present, we must grasp the autumn harvest and autumn sowing to strive for an agricultural bumper harvest.”

On September 11th, Jiang Zemin specially visited the lush and fragrant rice fields of “Shaanbei Jiangnan” (Southern Shaanxi in Northern Shaanxi), Nanyuanwan. He saw the place where the 359th Brigade carried out the Great Production Movement during the war, and the former rice fields have developed again. He said to the accompanying Shaanxi Provincial Party Secretary Zhang Boping and Yan'an Regional Party Secretary Bai Enpei, “The Great Production Movement is not just history, today we should carry forward this spirit. Chairman Mao said, ‘Self-reliance, clothing and food in abundance,’ during the Great Production Movement, the people of the border area all worked together, had food to eat and clothes to wear. Today, as long as everyone works together, we can continuously develop our country's agriculture.”

Jiang Zemin always kept the construction of the Party in mind during his visit to Yan'an. Everywhere he went, he would ask about the number of Party members in the village, how often the Party's organizational life was held, and how the Party members played a model role. In Zaoyuan Township Miaogou Village, he heard that 19 Party members could all play a model role, and the prestige of the Party branch was very high. He said, “The construction of the Party, the quality of Party members is very important, and we should not pursue quantity. Without quality, quantity is of no use. After the Long March, the Red Army that came to Yan'an had only 30,000 people, these 30,000 people were the seeds of the revolution, and after blooming and bearing fruit across the country, they developed into a great force, defeating the 800,000 troops of the Kuomintang, so the quality of Party members is very important. We must build the Party's primary-level organizations well and fully play the role of the primary-level organizations as fortresses and the Party members as vanguards and models.”

In Yan'an, Jiang Zemin also met with many old comrades who participated in the symposium on the economic development of the old base areas in Northern Shaanxi and spoke at the meeting. He asked all levels of Party organizations and government departments to take helping the people in the old, minority, border, and poor areas to get rid of poverty and become prosperous as an important political and economic task; he hoped that all places would carry forward the Yan'an spirit when getting rid of poverty and becoming prosperous, and changing the backward appearance; all places should change the simple relief-style poverty alleviation to a new economic development-style poverty alleviation.

After the inspection in Yan'an, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to Xi'an, where he, accompanied by Shaanxi Provincial Party Secretary Zhang Boping and Governor Hou Zongbin, inspected some factories and schools known as the “textile city,” “electrical city,” “electronics city,” and “aircraft city,” listened to the report of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, warmly met with old comrades working in Shaanxi, and made important speeches on the current work. During the inspection of Xi'an Jiaotong University, the General Secretary warmly visited his former teacher, met with student representatives, and encouraged them to respect their teachers and study hard. He hoped that the school leadership and the majority of teachers would have both enthusiasm and strict requirements for the majority of young students, and cultivate the young students who are the hope and future of the motherland well.

On September 14th, Jiang Zemin ended his inspection in Shaanxi and returned to Beijing. Accompanying Jiang Zemin on the inspection were Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission Gan Ziyu, Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang, Vice Director of the Central Office Zeng Qinghong, and Deputy Director of the State Council Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas Yang Yongzhe.

　　在视察陕北革命老区时
　　江泽民强调发扬延安精神
　　要求把党的基层组织建设好发挥党员先锋模范作用
    新华社西安9月14日电  （记者王煌彦）“自力更生，艰苦奋斗的延安精神没有过时。抗日战争、解放战争的艰苦岁月要发扬延安精神；社会主义初级阶段，也离不开延安精神。否则，我们的社会主义是很难建成的。”这是江泽民总书记视察延安时，反复强调的问题。
    在国庆40周年前夕，江泽民总书记带着党中央、国务院对延安和老区人民的关怀，于9月9日到12日视察了毛主席和党中央生活和战斗了10个春秋的革命圣地延安。在这里，总书记听取了延安地区和延安市的工作汇报；视察了延安市郊区的农村；瞻仰了毛泽东和老一辈无产阶级革命家的旧居和革命遗址。
    江泽民总书记谈到他视察延安的目的时说：在建国40周年前夕，想到外地做些调查研究。在考虑究竟到哪里去时，很自然地想起了革命圣地延安。延安及陕北人民在抗日战争、解放战争中曾为中国革命事业做出了巨大牺牲和重大贡献。我们党和国家很多优秀领导人和骨干都是在延安培养出来的。我们不应该忘记过去，更不应该忘记老区人民。延安地处黄土高原，自然条件差，若干年来因各种原因还比较贫困。这次到延安，我是来向延安人民转达党中央、国务院的关怀和慰问的。通过看望延安人民，转达党和政府对全国老区人民的亲切问候。
    江泽民总书记非常关心延安老区人民的生活，他既视察了延安市已经脱贫致富的农户，又访问了比较贫困的农户。在已经脱贫致富的枣园乡庙沟村，总书记曾登上山坡看了枝头挂满硕果的集体果园，并到收入万元以上的农户贺巨庭家的窑洞里作客。在比较贫困的万花乡向阳村，总书记坐在贫困户胡进海的炕头和他拉家常。当听说这位农民和他的两个儿子都有眼病，劳动不方便，生活困难时，总书记就关照村支书孙文义多支持和帮助他。在窑外大树下，孙文义向总书记汇报了他们村脱贫致富的决心，他说：“给我们支持，我们脱贫快一些；不给我们支持，我们也要好好干，只不过脱贫慢一些。”总书记听后说，你们的打算很好，就是要有一股自力更生的精神。当然国家还要给你们支持，帮助你们早日脱贫致富。
    总书记在延安着重视察和了解了当地的农业生产。他在听取延安地区和延安市的汇报后说，以农业为基础的思想千万不要忘记。民以食为天。否则，我们11亿人口的吃饭问题就是个大问题。当前要抓好秋收秋种，争取农业丰收。
    9月11日，江泽民同志专程访问了山青水秀、稻花飘香的
  “陕北江南”南泥湾。他看到当年三五九旅开展大生产运动的地方，当年的米粮川又有新的发展，对陪同访问的陕西省委书记张勃兴和延安地委书记白恩培说，大生产运动不光是历史，今天更应该发扬这种精神。毛主席说自己动手，丰衣足食，大生产运动时边区人民都动手，有了吃又有了穿。今天，只要大家都动手，就能不断把我国的农业搞上去。
    江泽民同志在延安访问中时刻把党的建设挂在心头。每到一地，他总要询问村里有多少党员，党的组织生活多长时间过一次，党员的模范带头作用如何？在枣园乡庙沟村，他听说19个党员都能起模范带头作用，党支部的威信很高时，他说，党的建设，党员的素质很重要，不能追求数量。没有素质，数量是没有用的。长征后，到延安的红军只有3万多人，这3万人就是革命的种子，在全国开花结果后，发展成巨大力量，把国民党的八百万军队都打垮了，所以说党员的素质很重要。要把党的基层组织建设好，充分发挥基层组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。
    在延安，江泽民同志还会见了参加陕北老区经济开发座谈会的许多老同志，并在会上讲了话。他要求各级党组织和政府部门把帮助老少边穷地区人民脱贫致富作为一项重要的政治任务和经济任务来抓；希望各地在脱贫致富，改变落后面貌时，要发扬延安精神；各地要把单纯救济式的扶贫，改为新的经济开发式的扶贫。
    在延安视察后，江泽民总书记又来到了西安，在陕西省委书记张勃兴、省长侯宗宾陪同下，视察了被称为纺织城、电工城、电子城和飞机城的一些工厂和学校，听取了陕西省委汇报，亲切会见了在陕西工作的老同志，并就当前的工作做了重要的讲话。在西安交通大学视察时，总书记亲切地看望了他当年的老师，接见了学生代表。他勉励学生要尊敬师长，好好学习。希望学校领导和广大教师，对广大青年学生既要满腔热情，又要严格要求，把作为祖国希望与未来的青年学生培育好。
    9月14日，江泽民同志结束了在陕西的视察，返回北京。随同江泽民同志视察的有国家计委副主任甘子玉、农业部副部长刘江、中央办公厅副主任曾庆红、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组副组长杨雍哲。（附图片）
    9月9日至12日，中共中央总书记江泽民视察了延安。他强调要发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的延安精神，搞好四化建设大业。这是江泽民总书记在延安万花乡农民胡进海家的窑洞里一边喝着大碗茶，一边和乡亲们亲切交谈。　新华社记者　安克仁摄（传真照片）
