The first Cross-Strait Film Festival opened grandly on the evening of September 8th at the New World Theater in New York's Chinatown. The mainland film "Spring Peach" and the Taiwanese film "The Wronged Woman" were screened at the opening ceremony.

This is the first film festival featuring mainland and Taiwanese films organized by overseas Chinese since the founding of New China 40 years ago. The mainland and Taiwan each selected nine outstanding films, including "Spring Peach," "The First Woman in the Mountain Village," "The Great Kunlun Mountains," and "Dream of the Red Chamber" from the mainland, and "The Wronged Woman," "Endless Love," "My Love," and "The Scarecrow" from Taiwan.

The host of this film festival and the general manager of the New World Theater, Mr. Sun Jinchang, said at the opening ceremony that the purpose of this film festival is to introduce Chinese films, whether from the mainland or Taiwan, to Chinese people in the United States. He also hopes that in the future, films from both sides of the Taiwan Strait can be introduced to each other.

Famous Taiwanese director Liu Yi said at the opening ceremony, "Although the mainland and Taiwan have been separated for 40 years, we all want to come together because we are all Chinese." He hopes that this film festival can become "the first step towards unification."

Famous Chinese director and director of "Spring Peach," Ling Zifeng, the actress Li Xiuming who played the female lead in "The First Woman in the Mountain Village," and Taiwanese director Dan Hanchang also attended the opening ceremony.

On September 8th, the first Cross-Strait Film Festival in China opened at the New World Theater in New York's Chinatown. Eighteen outstanding films will be shown to audiences over the course of a month-long festival. This is a discussion between film artists from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and New York's Chinese community.

　　海峡两岸电影节在纽约隆重开幕
    据新华社纽约电　（记者雷力利）首届海峡两岸电影节8日晚在纽约唐人街新都戏院隆重开幕。大陆影片《春桃》和台湾影片《怨女》在开幕式上作首场放映。
    这是新中国成立40年来海外华人举办的首届大陆、台湾电影节。大陆和台湾各选送了9部优秀影片，其中包括来自大陆的《春桃》、《山村中的头一个女人》、《巍巍昆仑》、《红楼梦》和来自台湾的《怨女》、《长情万缕》、《我的爱》、《稻草人》等。
    本届电影节主持人、新都戏院总经理孙锦昌先生在开幕式上说，本届电影节的宗旨是把中国的电影，无论是大陆还是台湾的，介绍给在美国的华人。他还希望今后还能将海峡两岸的影片各自介绍给对方。
    来自台湾的著名导演刘艺在开幕式上表示，尽管“大陆、台湾一个国家分割了40年，但是大家都想合在一起，因为我们都是中国人”。他希望这届电影节能够成为“迈向统一的第一步”。
