Vietnam Occupies Our Islands in the Spratlys
China Government Issues Statement Strongly Condemning

	BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman Li Zhaoxing of the Chinese Foreign Ministry today issued a statement strongly condemning the Vietnamese authorities for illegally occupying parts of the Spratly Islands belonging to China. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Since June this year, the Vietnamese authorities have dispatched troops to illegally occupy China's Spratly Islands, including Boo Boo Reef, Vanh An Bank, and Gaya Bank. This is a blatant infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty.

	It is well known that the Spratly Islands, like the Paracel Islands, Macclesfield Bank, and Pratas Island, have been China's sacred territory since ancient times. China has indisputable sovereignty over these islands and their adjacent waters.

	The Chinese government strongly condemns the Vietnamese authorities' illegal occupation of parts of the Spratly Islands and firmly demands that Vietnam withdraw from the islands and reefs it has illegally occupied in the Spratlys.

    越南侵占我南沙群岛岛礁
    我政府发表声明强烈谴责
    本报北京9月28日讯　记者孙毅报道：中国外交部发言人李肇星今天在新闻发布会上发表声明，强烈谴责越南当局非法侵占中国南沙群岛的部分岛礁。声明全文如下：
    今年6月以来，越南当局派遣军队先后非法侵占中国南沙群岛的蓬勃堡礁、万安滩、广雅滩。这是对中国领土主权的公然侵犯。
    众所周知，南沙群岛和西沙群岛、中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，自古以来就是中国的神圣领土，中国对这些群岛及其附近海域拥有无可争辩的主权。
    中国政府强烈谴责越南当局非法侵占中国南沙群岛的部分岛礁的行径，并坚决要求越南方面从其非法侵占的南沙群岛各岛礁上撤出去。
