In April of this year, the U.S. Tobacco Exporters Association, in an attempt to "invade" the Thai market, requested that the U.S. Trade Representative's Office invoke Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act. This special clause empowers the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to investigate trading partners and, if it finds "unfair trade policies and practices" against U.S. industries, to take retaliatory measures.

At the end of July and beginning of August, a team from the U.S. Trade Representative's Office visited Thailand. They held discussions with Thai officials on the issue of importing American cigarettes and conducted investigations into the Thai market to determine if there were any "unfair" trade practices against the U.S. tobacco industry.

Thailand, in support of its nationwide anti-smoking campaign, has implemented a ban on the import of foreign cigarettes. This policy was reaffirmed in two cabinet meetings held in July. The Thai government believes that maintaining the ban on foreign cigarettes is reasonable. During the negotiations, the Thai side stood firm on its position and sincerely explained to the U.S. side that the Thai government, like the U.S. government, must take responsibility for the health of its people. They also emphasized the importance of maintaining the achievements of the anti-smoking campaign, including the ban on foreign cigarettes and the control of domestic cigarette production. The national smoking rate has decreased from 30% in 1976 to the current 26%. They hoped that the U.S. side would understand this.

However, the U.S. Trade Representative argued that "the health hazards of cigarettes are unrelated to trade issues and should not be mixed together." The U.S. side insisted that Thailand's ban on the import of American cigarettes is an "unfair" practice. If Thailand continues to maintain this stance, the U.S. will take retaliatory trade measures as per the law.

To prove the potential of the Thai cigarette market and the "unfair" practices against the U.S. tobacco industry, local newspapers revealed that "the U.S. has quietly hired college students in Bangkok and other major cities to test the Thai people's reaction to American cigarettes and their taste, even distributing free packs of cigarettes to those who prefer foreign brands."

A leader of the Thai anti-smoking movement said, "If American cigarettes are legally allowed into the Thai market, we will lose the achievements of many years, and hundreds of thousands of people will be harmed by smoking." He stated that the organization would formally protest to the U.S. side.

Considering the interests of its own people, relevant departments of the Thai government are still trying to negotiate with the U.S. side, hoping that the U.S. side will make concessions.

The local media has also published numerous articles criticizing the U.S.'s self-serving actions. Some newspapers quoted an article from the U.S. *Los Angeles Times* titled "Exporting Death," which revealed, "Although smoking in the U.S. is decreasing, cigarette sales are increasing. This strange phenomenon is due to the U.S. government pressuring Asian countries to import American cigarettes. If they refuse, they will face trade sanctions and suffer heavy losses."

"Last year, U.S. cigarette exports reached $2.6 billion, double the amount from three years ago. Many U.S. officials say this is a devil's bargain. Many Asians will die from cancer and other diseases due to smoking these products, which the U.S. government has labeled as dangerous. This aggressive export policy of the U.S. will one day bring global resentment."

### 香烟贸易起争端  美压泰开放市场

    香烟贸易起争端
    美压泰开放市场
    本报记者　刘爱成
    今年4月，美国香烟出口协会为“进军”泰国，要求美国贸易代表办公室对泰行使美国贸易法301条款，根据这项特别条款，美国贸易代表办公室有权调查贸易伙伴，发现有“对美国工业不公道的贸易政策和行为”就可进行报复。
    7月底8月初，美国贸易代表办公室派团来泰，一面与泰国方面就进口美国烟问题进行磋商，一面对泰国市场进行调查。看泰国对美国香烟工业有无“不公道”的贸易行为。
    泰国为配合全国性的反吸烟运动，数年前就实行了禁止洋烟进口法，并在今年7月两次召开的内阁会议上都再次肯定了这一政策，认为坚持禁止洋烟进口合情合理。所以在谈判中，泰方坚持自己的立场，并诚恳地告诉美方：泰国政府和美国政府一样，必须对泰国人民的健康问题负责；同时十分重视和维护多年来所取得的反吸烟运动成果，包括禁止洋烟进口，控制国内香烟生产；全国吸烟人数比率已从1976年的30％减少到目前的26％。希望美方对此能够理解。
    但是，美国贸易代表却强词夺理，说“香烟危害人体健康与贸易问题无关，不能混为一谈”。美方代表认定，泰国禁止美国香烟进口是“不公道”行为，如泰国继续坚持这一立场，美国将依法对泰国进行贸易报复。
    为证明泰国香烟市场的潜力和对美国烟草工业的“不公道”行为，此间报纸揭露说，“美国除了悄悄地雇用大专学生在曼谷及全国各重要城市试探泰国人对美国烟的味道和正式进口的反应，甚至向嗜好洋烟者送上一包免费洋烟。”
    泰国反吸烟运动组织领导人说，“如果美国香烟合法进入泰国市场，我们将丧失多年来的成果，数百万人将会被烟过早害死。”他表示该组织将向美方正式提出抗议。
    考虑到本国人民的切身利益，泰国政府有关部门仍在设法与美方交涉，希望美方能作出让步。
    此间舆论界更是纷纷发表文章，批评美国的损人利己做法。有的报纸引用美国
  《洛杉矶时报》的一篇题为《死亡输出》的文章揭露说，“虽然美国吸烟量不断减少，可是香烟销售量却在大增。出现这种怪现象的原因是美国政府威迫亚洲国家进口美国烟。如果它们不同意，就要对它们进行贸易制裁，使其付出惨重代价。”
  “去年美国香烟出口高达26亿美元，是三年前的两倍。许多美国官员说，这是一项魔鬼交易，许多亚洲人将会因为吸这种被美国政府指为危险产品而死于癌症及其他疾病。美国这种咄咄逼人的出口政策有朝一日将换来全球的怨恨。”
