In late September, the Chinese football team, under the watchful eyes of countless fans, began a series of warm-up activities to prepare for the upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against the top six teams in Asia. The Chinese team concluded three weeks of high-altitude training in Kunming on September 16th and then set off for the Middle East on September 18th. They faced off against the Kuwait national team on the 20th. In this closely matched game, the Chinese team lost 1-2. Three days later, the Chinese team defeated the Kuwait champions, Al-Arabi, with a score of 3-0. Chen Xuan, the president of the Chinese Football Association, who led the team, believed that the Chinese team played better in the latter match, but the opponents they faced were indeed weaker than the Kuwait national team. As the big tournament approaches, it is normal for teams to use various tactics. The China-Kuwait match was closely observed by teams from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and others. The Qatar team also did not field their full squad in their match against Kuwait.

On the 26th, the Chinese football team returned to Beijing to prepare for the Great Wall Cup International Football Tournament. Head coach Gao Fengwen believes that arranging such a training opportunity is beneficial for performing well in the upcoming six-team final in Singapore.

On September 29th, the Chinese team will face their "brothers," the Chinese Olympic team, in the first round of the Great Wall Cup. This young team, with an average age of 21 and an average height of 1.80 meters, recently performed well against the Brazilian team Santos and is currently leading the national first-tier league standings. The team's head coach, Xu Genbao, has stated that they will do their best to perform well in the Great Wall Cup. It is expected that this energetic and strong team will help the national team get into top form.

On the night of National Day, the Chinese team will face their fourth warm-up opponent, the Soviet Black Sea team from Odessa. This team finished fifth in the Soviet Union's league last year and has improved their ranking this year. It is said that the Chinese Football Association has no technical information on this Soviet team, so the match will be a good test of the Chinese team's adaptability and versatility.

On the evening of October 3rd, the Chinese team will face the Pyongyang team from North Korea in the final match of the Great Wall Cup. This team is familiar to Chinese fans. The team's coach, upon arriving in Beijing, revealed that the Pyongyang team is one of the top three teams in North Korea. The team has an average age of 22, and currently, five players are preparing with the North Korean national team for the final in Singapore and are unable to come to China. Recently, they defeated the visiting Chinese Dalian team 4-1 and the Soviet Sakhalin team 2-0 in Pyongyang, but lost 1-2 to a Brazilian first-tier team. North Korean football is known for its aggressive and tough style. The China-North Korea match will be a good test of the Chinese team's physical condition, adaptability to high-intensity battles, and mastery of the East Asian style of play.

The Chinese team's final warm-up match will also be against the Soviet Black Sea team, but the location will be moved to Guangzhou, where the climate is similar to Singapore's. It is clear that this warm-up schedule has been carefully arranged. The Chinese team will gradually get into the right mindset through the Great Wall Cup and head to Singapore in their best condition.

    以最佳状态决战狮城
    ——谈中国足球队参加长城杯赛的着眼点
    9月下旬，万千球迷注目的中国足球队为迎接世界杯外围赛亚洲六强决战，开始了计划之中的一系列热身活动。
    中国队9月16日在昆明结束了三周的高原训练后，9月18日远征西亚，20日即与科威特国家队交锋。在这场实力相当的比赛中，中国队以1∶2失利。三天后，中国队以3∶0战胜科威特冠军阿拉伯人队。率队出征的中国足协主席年维泗认为，中国队后一场比赛打得比第一场好，但碰到的对手实力也的确不如科威特国家队。由于大赛将至，对手之间虚虚实实的事是很正常的。中科之战受到卡塔尔、阿联酋等队的“侦察”，而卡塔尔队在同科威特队的比赛也没有派出完整的阵容。
    26日，中国足球队回到北京，准备参加长城杯国际足球锦标赛。主教练高丰文认为，安排这样一次锻炼队伍的机会，对打好在新加坡进行的六强决战是有利的。
    9月29日，中国队在长城杯赛首轮将与自己的“兄弟”——中国奥林匹克队比赛。这个年轻的对手平均年龄21岁，平均身高1米80，不久前迎战巴西桑托斯队时的良好表现曾得到行家们的赞许，目前又在全国甲级队联赛的积分表上暂居首席。该队主教练徐根宝提出，要在长城杯赛上尽力发挥水平。可以想见，有这支富有朝气的生力军“陪场”，可能促进国家队进入“状态”。
    国庆之夜，中国队将迎战热身赛的第四个对手苏联敖德萨黑海人俱乐部队。这个队去年在全苏比赛获第五名，今年积分情况又有上升。据说，连中国足协也没有一点关于这支苏联球队的技术资料，中国队与之交锋，看来将是队员们适应能力和应变能力的锻炼。
    10月3日晚，中国队将与朝鲜平壤队演长城杯赛的压轴戏。这个对手中国球迷并不陌生。该队教练抵京后透露，平壤队是朝鲜全国比赛前三名的队伍，平均年龄22岁，现在队中有五人随朝鲜国家队备战新加坡决赛而未能来华。最近，他们在平壤迎战来访的客队，以4∶1胜中国大连队，2∶0胜苏联萨哈林队，只以1∶2负于巴西一支甲级队。朝鲜足球风格向来拚得凶，打得硬，中朝之战对中国队的体力状况及适应高强度的激战，以及掌握东亚风格的踢法，都是一次检验的机会。
    中国队的最后一场热身赛对手仍是苏联黑海人队，但地点移至广州，气候与新加坡相近。看得出，这张热身计划表安排得颇费功夫。中国队将在长城杯赛中通过热身渐入角色，以最佳状态飞赴狮城。本报记者　汪大昭
