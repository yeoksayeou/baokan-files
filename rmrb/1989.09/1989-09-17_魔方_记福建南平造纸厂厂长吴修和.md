The Magic Cube - A Record of Wu Xiuhe, Director of Fujian Nanping Paper Mill
Cong Weixi

During the Jin Dynasty, Zuo Si wrote the famous "Three Capitals Rhapsody," which caused a sensation in both the court and among the common people. Officials and the public all copied and treasured it, leading to a temporary scarcity of paper in Luoyang. Fast forward to the late 1980s, due to the excessive felling of forests and the shortage of raw materials for papermaking, a paper famine swept across the country's cultural and publishing industries. How to alleviate this hunger? Perhaps Wu Xiuhe's "magic cube" and his spirit of perseverance can provide some inspiration...

	With the words of writers as the opening
	“This man is a true reformer,” writer Lao Zhang whispered to me, “Writers should write about such figures.”
	Old writer Kang Zhi was excited about Wu Xiuhe's achievements, and he whispered to me, “Who would have thought that in the mountains of Wuyi, there is such a talent!”
	Lao Feng said, “In the current tide of reform, those who have the courage and seize opportunities are not many. Wu Xiuhe is one of them. This truly fits the legend of the beautiful mountains and waters of Wuyi.”

	These words were spoken in the spacious and elegant reception hall of the Nanping Paper Mill. The time was after the writers' visit to the Nanping Paper Mill. When we, a group of more than ten writers, followed the tall and sturdy Wu Xiuhe from the mill's timber storage pond and modern paper-making workshop, we expressed these heartfelt words.

	The overseas Chinese writer Chen Ruoxi, who accompanied us to visit Wuyi Mountain, was particularly excited. She sat in a chair in the reception hall, holding a megaphone, and directly expressed her feelings to Wu Xiuhe:

	“Mr. Wu, please accept the respect of this descendant of the Yellow Emperor. You have turned a paper mill with several thousand employees into a civilized small society, which shows your extraordinary talent. I am not one to flatter, and my words are not exaggerated.” Perhaps Chen Ruoxi's words were so moving and sincere that she received enthusiastic applause in the reception hall. Wu Xiuhe quickly stood up, cupped his hands, and politely thanked Chen Ruoxi for her encouragement.

	At this moment, the writers' gazes all turned to Wu Xiuhe. He was not only tall and imposing but also had the dignified appearance of a man. His dark blue suit had not a single wrinkle, and the knot of his bright red tie was tied round and square. Occasionally, he revealed a hint of a smile, and the smile lines showed the humility and tolerance that outstanding entrepreneurs possess; sometimes, he closed his lips thoughtfully, and a sense of determination and confidence shone from his serious mouth lines, possessing a kind of entrepreneurial charm.

	The Unique Reform "Magic Cube"

	With the end of the "smash everything" era, the news, education, and cultural publishing industries were calling for their medium of transmission—the paper industry.

	The culture that had been frozen for a decade began to revive in the new historical period, like green shoots turning from yellow to green, and the demand for paper increased exponentially. Wu Xiuhe took on the role of director of the Nanping Paper Mill, nestled in the embrace of Wuyi Mountain, at this critical moment—January 1983.

	The paper production of the Nanping Paper Mill ranked third in the country. Its historical contribution was to provide newsprint to major newspapers and magazines across the country: from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Guangdong in the south to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing in the north, all within the supply range of Nanping paper. In 1983 and 1984, the printing and circulation of newspapers and magazines increased significantly, and the demand for paper in various places not only brought enormous pressure to Wu Xiuhe, who had just taken office, but also provided a historical opportunity for a reformer to showcase his talents. Wu Xiuhe performed a drama that shocked the paper industry on this stage of risk. In this drama, there was no bourgeois romance, nor was there any ethereal poetry—papermaking requires machines, and Wu Xiuhe was dealing with gigantic machines. This drama was the reform of the "Number One Paper Machine," which dominated the fate of the Nanping Paper Mill. The "Number One Paper Machine" was the main machine of the Nanping Paper Mill, and Wu Xiuhe's reform plan was: stop production and renovate.

	Those who attended the expanded factory meeting were all paper industry experts and engineering and technical personnel, all old partners who had rolled with Wu Xiuhe for many years. Although they knew that solving the "Number One Paper Machine" was the key to the Nanping Paper Mill's takeoff, they had many doubts about stopping production for renovation. Obviously, stopping production would affect the completion of the annual task, and these clever guys calculated according to the routine of replacing mechanical equipment: the construction project plus the introduction of equipment, not to mention the huge expenditure, just the commissioning of the equipment manufacturing plant to undertake the design, procurement, installation, and trial operation of several major projects, would exhaust the Nanping Paper Mill's assets and still need to borrow a large sum of money from the state. If the trial operation failed, what would the future of the Nanping Paper Mill be? Everyone was very clear about this. Therefore, they all remained silent about Wu Xiuhe's plan.

	Wu Xiuhe understood his old partners' feelings very well. In the 1950s, he had participated in the installation, trial operation, and production of the "Number One Paper Machine" with these old partners. Every mechanical part of this papermaking machine, even down to a single screw, had a deep emotional connection with every meeting participant; but he knew that the 1980s was not an era of nostalgia and sentimentality. Ruthless competition required people to break away from nostalgic feelings and dare to seize the opportunity of risk, only then could the enterprise have the possibility of survival and development. Just as a newborn baby is always accompanied by the mother's labor pains.

	“Well, everyone, speak up!” Although Wu Xiuhe's heart was turbulent, his face remained calm and composed. “The 'Number One Paper Machine' produces 50-60 tons per day, and we can no longer meet the demand for paper. Except for breaking the pot and changing the blood of the 'Number One,' we have no other way out!”

	“How will the annual production plan be completed?” Finally, someone couldn't stand the suffocating silence and voiced their inner worries, “If this shot is fired, it's worth it if we can bring back a prey, but what if the tiger bites off the gun barrel?”

	“As long as the 'Number One' is renovated, the production can be made up from the 'New Number One'?” The second speaker said, “It's just the overall idea of updating the 'Number One,' but how much success rate does it have? Old Wu, this matter is related to the overall situation.”

	Wu Xiuhe weighed it in his heart, the two deputies seemed to be talking about two issues, but it was actually one issue, both worried about the risk being too great, fearing that the horse would stumble and fall into a situation that was difficult to clean up.

	In fact, those who harbored such worries were not just his deputies; even his wife, Ai Zhen, was anxious about his decision to replace the "Number One Paper Machine." She did not want her husband to be a lazy director who did nothing all day, but she was also deeply worried about this risky move. In the dead of night, she whispered to him, “The safest way is to introduce a set of advanced paper production lines from the West.”

	Wu Xiuhe jokingly replied to his wife, “You sound just like the foreign businessmen. The other day, representatives from Mitsubishi Company of Japan and Voith Company of Austria came to the factory to discuss business, and they both advised me to introduce an advanced production line, which would save both time and effort. They also said, 'Mr. Wu, this factory is not yours alone, why take such a big risk and do something without guarantee?' I said, 'I'm sorry, our country is still poor, spending so much foreign exchange, we would feel guilty. Our plan is to spend less money and do big things.' Ai Zhen, think about it, if we take this risk-free path, we will have to hire a 'foreign nanny' to be the teacher, and all these years of hard work by our Chinese engineering and technical personnel will be in vain!”

	“But can you convince your comrades?” His wife was still full of doubts.

	“I can. I will try to convince them.”

	Just as his wife had predicted, the factory meeting did not go smoothly. Wu Xiuhe could only control his impatience and, with calmness and confidence, explain his plan again: “This reform plan, from a macro perspective, is neither minor repairs nor small-scale actions, because that would not solve the enterprise's survival and development problems; nor is it the introduction of a complete set of advanced Western equipment. Our path is a path that no one has taken before, and to take the strengths of Western papermaking machinery from various countries and graft them onto the 'Number One,' making the 'Number One' a new type of papermaking machine that is 'comprehensive and integrated.' In this way, we can spend less foreign exchange and achieve good results. Hybridization conforms to eugenics, and the Nanping Paper Mill will give birth to a big golden baby!” Then, Wu Xiuhe, relying on nearly thirty years of papermaking technology, fully expounded the strategic idea of “comprehensive and integrated, and discarding the short.” He said excitedly, “According to the technical data we have accumulated from several trips abroad, this risk is worth taking. I'll lead the way to step on the mine. If there are any problems, I'll take off my official hat. Today, I don't force my comrades to agree with my idea, but I also can't keep discussing without deciding. Three meetings to decide the plan. Dismissed!”

	Bold ideas accompanied by precise arguments, after three meetings, Wu Xiuhe's unique reform plan finally convinced his partners. His deputies supplemented the shortcomings of Wu Xiuhe's plan and proposed rational suggestions. After careful research, they unanimously agreed: to achieve a thorough renovation of the "Number One," the first challenge was to negotiate with foreign companies to purchase mechanical parts from various countries that could optimize the "Number One." This was a very tedious and tricky problem. According to the prediction of technical personnel, the total disassembly and assembly volume of the "Number One" equipment was about 1,200 tons, 25 kilometers of cables needed to be laid, and 4,600 square meters of construction work (expanding the factory building) was required. The workload was enormous, and the problems were numerous, but these difficulties, for Wu Xiuhe, who had joined the papermaking industry in 1953 and had served as the director of the Construction Department, Equipment and Technology Department, deputy director of the workshop, expansion project commander, deputy director, and finally director of the Nanping Paper Mill, were seen as the historical opportunity for the Nanping Paper Mill to break through.

	“Do it!” Wu Xiuhe spat out this iron-clad word. Either the horse would stumble and fall into disgrace, or the "Nanping Paper" would be elevated to a new historical height. Wu Xiuhe fearlessly stepped onto this stage of risk.

	A Clever Negotiator

	What followed was a series of negotiations with foreign companies to introduce mechanical parts, which Wu Xiuhe humorously referred to as "fighting the Eight-Nation Alliance." What is worth praising is that Wu Xiuhe was not only a reformer with courage but also a clever negotiator. When he talked about entrepreneurs not only needing to be bold but also needing to be precise in every detail, he had a small anecdote to share: “When I was young, I was very poor, and I helped out at my uncle's rice shop. I saw him cherish even a single grain of rice that fell to the ground, and I also saw my uncle use stacks of tickets to buy and sell, earning more tickets.” His uncle's influence on him was profound, so Wu Xiuhe particularly disliked the vulgarity of some entrepreneurs showing off. Although the Nanping Paper Mill was the wealthiest tax-paying enterprise in Fujian Province—with an annual tax revenue of around 70 million yuan, Wu Xiuhe, during his negotiations with foreign companies and his days of purchasing "Number One" mechanical parts abroad, still cherished every dollar, splitting a dollar into two halves.

	Once, Wu Xiuhe led a technical team to Beijing to negotiate with Austrian clients about introducing "Number One" equipment. The negotiation venue was set in the "China Tech Company" in the western suburbs, but Wu Xiuhe and his partners did not stay in hotels, but in a reception house far from the "China Tech Company" in the eastern city. They did not take taxis to go out, but took public buses every day to avoid Beijing's rush hour. Wu Xiuhe and the team members had to get up early and return late every day. For lunch, he took everyone to eat from street vendors, and after lunch, he lay down in the park to take a nap, which was to ensure that he had enough energy for the afternoon negotiations. Austrian client Mr. Koland jokingly referred to him as the "Chinese Tiger." Yes, at the negotiation table, Wu Xiuhe was fully focused, and he did not miss a single detail. Beforehand, he always understood the various situations of the other party, and thus he was very good at psychological warfare. Mr. Koland's agent was Mr. Qiu, the boss of a certain foreign firm in Hong Kong. He said, “Director Wu always wants to have both the bear's paw and the fish. He wants to buy a brand, but he is stingy with the money in his pocket. You've taken all the bargains!”

	Even so, Wu Xiuhe was still not satisfied. It was on this night of the negotiation that, when he and his partners were discussing the pros and cons of purchasing a coarse pulp machine on the bus, someone thought that the price of this machine should be pressed down further. Wu Xiuhe returned to the accommodation and called Mr. Qiu, asking him to come to their accommodation. Mr. Qiu came as summoned and, when Wu Xiuhe said that he wanted to further reduce the price of the coarse pulp machine, he said helplessly, “The price has already been clearly stated in the intention contract, how...” Wu Xiuhe said, “Ask Mr. Koland to add a measuring instrument for us, otherwise it will be difficult to continue doing business in the future. We are not doing a one-time deal!” Mr. Qiu and Mr. Koland discussed and finally agreed to add a measuring instrument worth tens of thousands of dollars to the Nanping Paper Mill.

	Wu Xiuhe dared to make demands beyond the norm because he knew both himself and his opponent. He knew that Mr. Koland's Voith Company's products were eager to open up the Chinese market. For more than a decade, the company's products had not sold well in China, especially recently, the company had lost to the American Berle Company in a competition to sell machinery to a Chinese paper mill. Wu Xiuhe, with his unique insight, saw through Mr. Koland's anxious mindset of selling products and launched one attack after another, winning repeatedly. Later, Mr. Koland exclaimed, “Mr. Wu, there is no director more shrewd than you. Your paper mill will definitely create the best in China.”

	After that, there were negotiations with seven companies from Japan's Mitsubishi, Canada's Janson, Switzerland's BBC, Britain's Hunter, West Germany's Agena, and the United States' Aquila for forty consecutive days.

	Before each negotiation, Wu Xiuhe and his assistants would stay up all night flipping through detailed materials from various companies to seek various negotiation strategies. When Wu Xiuhe introduced the world-famous rewinding machine produced by the German Agena Company, he first forced the Agena representative, who never reduced the price of mechanical products, to reduce the price by 5%, and then to 8%. A branded product priced at forty thousand dollars was able to reduce the price for Wu Xiuhe time and time again because the Agena manager admired Wu Xiuhe's familiarity with the mechanical performance. He said, “Such a business expert using our company's products is an honor for our company. You are the first Chinese papermaking director to appreciate our branded products, and I believe you can promote our branded goods!” Look, magical negotiations achieved magical results. Only Wu Xiuhe's assistants knew that their director, in order to win every battle and save every dollar for the country, often stayed up late flipping through materials until his eyes were red.

	It goes without saying that the distinguished wealthy man of Fujian was tirelessly fighting in these forty days of negotiations, staying in a simple reception house every day, taking public buses, eating from street vendors, and taking a nap on the park bench every day. Even on the days when the negotiations were not scheduled, the assistants could not go to the street to watch a movie. Wu Xiuhe's spirit was the same as continuous fighting, and every second of the forty days and nights was for winning the "war" on the negotiation table against the "Eight-Nation Alliance."

	Wu Xiuhe was like this during negotiations, and he was also like this during overseas inspections. He was tall and walked quickly. Once, the inspection team landed in Los Angeles, USA. The team members knew that there was the world-famous Disneyland here. But no one dared to suggest it to Wu Xiuhe. It was Wu Xiuhe who noticed the team members' thoughts, and he said humorously and wittily, “Now we are a hungry man, going abroad is to fill our stomachs with knowledge. If we wait until our country is as rich as the United States, I will personally fund your trip to Disneyland.”

	In May 1984, the Hangzhou Daily invited Wu Xiuhe to discuss issues. After the meeting, the Hangzhou Daily expressed their gratitude and invited Wu Xiuhe to visit West Lake. This was Wu Xiuhe's first time in Hangzhou, but he politely declined. Later, the Nanping Paper Mill received a letter of thanks from the Hangzhou Daily, in which they expressed their admiration for Wu Xiuhe's integrity and public spirit. They wrote in the letter, “Such an upright big entrepreneur is not common in China.”

	Under the leadership of this "papermaking marshal," the thorough renovation of the "Number One Paper Machine"—including construction, demolition, installation, to trial operation, only stopped production for 57 days. The "New Number One" paper machine, after "optimized hybridization," reached the highest daily paper production of 100 tons, doubling the production of the "Old Number One." The "New Number One" ranked first in the same type of paper machines in the country.

	The entire factory was jubilant! The entire factory cheered!

	Wu Xiuhe's countless sleepless nights of hard work were compensated here. Because in the annual report, it was clearly written that the "New Number One" papermaking machine produced more than 8,000 tons of high-quality newsprint for the country in one year. Since it was computer-controlled, each ton of newsprint could produce 1,100 more sheets of paper than the "Old Number One."

	Wu Xiuhe did not indulge in his achievements. His feet were always on the ground, and he and his partners, without stopping, blew the trumpet for the renovation of the "Number Two Paper Machine" on February 17, 1987. With the experience of the "Number One" renovation, the "Number Two" renovation work progressed smoothly. They purchased mechanical parts from the United States, West Germany, Japan, and Britain and assembled the "New Number Two" in two months. The "New Number One" and "New Number Two" were like the two wings of an airplane, driving the Nanping Paper Mill to take off historically. According to precise statistics, since Wu Xiuhe took office in 1983, the Nanping Paper Mill has increased by ten thousand tons per year. Experts have identified that the "Xingguang" newsprint produced by the "New Number One" and "New Number Two" paper machines can compete with foreign offset newsprint in quality, thus obtaining the title of provincial and ministerial-level excellent products. The once unknown Wu Xiuhe, who only knew how to work hard, became a famous figure in the papermaking industry in Fujian Province and across the country in the era of reform; the Nanping Paper Mill won the 1988 National May Day Labor Award.

	A New-Type Entrepreneur Who Strictly Disciplines Himself

	Wu Xiuhe told me, “The breakthrough of the Nanping Paper Mill today is the result of the accumulation of achievements by the previous six directors and the joint efforts of the current five-member leadership team—we five all have our own professional technologies.”

	This leadership team, composed of insiders, had a far-reaching vision and aimed at talent development. According to Wu Xiuhe's words: the current enterprise competition, after all, is a competition of talent strength. Based on this understanding, the paper mill spared no expense in educating workers in science and technology, and according to precise statistics, by 1988, the factory's education funds had reached 4.13 million yuan (9.6 million yuan was spent on science and technology education in 1987 alone).

	Currently, the Nanping Paper Mill has formed a systematic training and education network from primary school, middle school, vocational school to college (including radio and television university). A total of 8,603 training personnel have been trained, covering 91% of the personnel who should be trained. Among the youth trained by the children's school, 235 people have been admitted to colleges and universities, 168 people have been admitted to secondary vocational schools, and 22 people are currently pursuing doctoral and master's degrees.

	Trees take ten years to grow, and people take a hundred years to grow. The leadership of the Nanping Paper Mill, facing the competitive world, opened their broad and magnificent hearts. When we writers visited the Nanping Paper Mill, we saw everywhere the factory's modern enterprise posture: between factory buildings and workshops, there were green spaces and flower beds. According to Wu Xiuhe, the greening coverage rate of the entire factory was 70%, with about 25,000 various flowers and trees planted. Particularly eye-catching was the beautiful cultural building covering an area of 3,400 square meters, with a library, reading room, game room, television room, billiard room, and art salon, as well as a music hall and dance hall. Unfortunately, when we visited the factory, it happened to be during the workers' busy working hours; but we still saw the colorful cultural life of the Nanping workers from the factory's video screen, from the performance of the orchestra to the fashionable disco dance...

	“Old Wu, if you dance, you must have extraordinary charm!” I said.

	He shook his head, “I can't dance.”

	“You...” I said.

	“I can't do anything, I can't play mahjong, I can't play poker, I can't... I only know how to smoke, but since the day I took office as the director, I quit smoking!” he said.

	“Oh?” I was a bit surprised.

	“To be honest, I have no time to play.” He smiled bitterly, “But I require myself to have a clear sense of the times. In this regard, my head and my body are separated, and I think the important thing is the head. If a director's head does not understand and grasp the current world, it is difficult to enter the ranks of modern enterprise competition; while enterprise culture and enterprise civilization are the red blood that modern enterprises rely on for development.”

	“You're absolutely right.” I nodded repeatedly.

	“For this reason, we have a satellite ground receiving station in the factory.” Wu Xiuhe talked freely, “Although our bodies are in the mountains of Wuyi, our eyes are always watching the world's technological trends.”

	This is precisely the fundamental reason why Wu Xiuhe can continue to break through in the fierce industrial competition. He is a knowledge worker who grew up in the 1950s. He respects science, respects knowledge, and continuously absorbs nutrients from science and knowledge, and in turn develops and opens up science and knowledge. This is the magic cube he uses to manage the factory. Of course, more importantly, Wu Xiuhe has a burning heart for the revival of the nation. He told me that the person who inspired him to have the ambition to turn Nanping into a new papermaking city was the old expert Jin Han, who had studied papermaking in the United States. When Wu Xiuhe was still a young man, the old engineer Jin Han told him about an experience: Jin Han was about to graduate from the University of Maine in the United States and return to his country when he once shared his dream of returning to China to make paper with his classmates. Jin Han stood on the podium, using a pointer on the globe, pointing to the map of China, which was like a rooster crowing at dawn, and said, “After returning to my country, I will definitely spare no effort to build China's papermaking city. This is the Great and Lesser Xing'an Mountains, this is Xishuangbanna, this is the Minnan forest belt...” The classmates laughed at his great ambition, and even his favorite professor, Grant, reminded him, “China is the ancestor of papermaking, and I respect your true feelings for your country. But now China is a place of warlordism and misery, and it is difficult to realize your ambition!” Jin Han returned to China, and he traveled around the country, hired a guide, and conducted a long-distance survey in the southwestern forest area. But his dream of papermaking was torn apart by the sound of Japanese cannons invading China, until after the founding of New China, he realized his dream of papermaking in Nanping, where the three major tributaries of the Minjiang River converge.

	This old intellectual's sincere dedication to the revival of the nation had a profound influence on Wu Xiuhe. This also shaped his ideal, which is to turn Nanping into a modern papermaking city.

	Standing on the water reservoir of the paper mill, I once asked Old Wu why there were so many logs soaking in the water. Wu Xiuhe said, “This is our water-based timber storage, with about tens of thousands of cubic meters of timber. This is to consider that papermaking raw materials will become increasingly scarce, and we have stored them in advance. The ancients have a saying: 'Do not move the troops until the grain is ready.'”

	Another forward-looking action. But I thought that this timber could only solve the problem for one or two years, so I asked, “What about the future?”

	“In 1988, we established a forestry company with one city and four counties nearby to solve the raw material problem for the 'Nanping Paper.' We have preserved a large area of forest, which is to solve the 'Nanping Paper's' long-term problem.” Wu Xiuhe sighed, “To be honest, these measures are difficult to solve the fundamental shortage of papermaking raw materials. You also know that China's forestry resources are very poor, and we are moving one eye from the forest and aiming at another path of papermaking.”

	“Another new trick?” I was very surprised. “I believe this path can be walked. We are waiting for the National Development and Reform Commission to review and approve the project.” Wu Xiuhe confidently told me about his papermaking vision...

	In fact, Wu Xiuhe is not special, he only has a sense of responsibility for the revival of China and a spirit of unyielding struggle for a set goal. This spirit, like a magnet, attracts and forges the new generation of "Nanping Paper." The current deputy director of the factory, Chen Yunlin, graduated from Shanghai Light Industry University in 1964. The superior leadership adjusted him to be the county magistrate, but he declined politely. Chen Yunlin said, “My life goal is to dedicate myself to papermaking, like Director Wu, to achieve something.” In addition, whether it is old workers or young workers in the factory, they all respect Wu Xiuhe's pioneering spirit, so this spirit can easily become the common wealth of the workers of the Nanping Paper Mill. Of course, where there are people, there are contradictions, and Wu Xiuhe sometimes could not escape this entanglement: once, during an expanded factory meeting, a pear fell from the table and rolled to Wu Xiuhe's feet. Wu Xiuhe bent down to pick up the pear and placed it on the table. Someone half-jokingly said, “Did you see that? Even the pear rolls towards Old Wu!” Wu Xiuhe always responded to this with a broad mind.

	He strictly disciplined himself, always reflecting on his own shortcomings, and thus the contradictions were alleviated or eliminated. The secretary of the factory, Huang Zongxiong, once told me, “Once, during a party small group meeting, I saw that he was too tired managing the entire factory, so I did not notify him. He scolded me severely and conducted self-criticism at the party small group meeting. It is really hard to find someone who manages a factory with thousands of people and demands so much of himself!”

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    魔方
    ——记福建南平造纸厂厂长吴修和
　　从维熙
    晋代左思，写出名篇《三都赋》，朝野轰动，达官百姓皆抄写珍藏，一时间造成“洛阳纸贵”。时至二十世纪八十年代之尾，由于森林之滥伐，造纸原料之短缺，纸荒之饥遍及全国文化出版界。何以解饥？吴修和求索的“魔方”及其艰苦奋进的精神，或许对我们能有所启迪……
          以作家们的话为开篇
      “这条汉子，称得上货真价实的改革家。”作家老张对我耳语说，“作家该为这样的人物立传。”
    老作家康濯对吴修和的业绩，激动不已，他悄声地对我说：“想不到武夷山的山沟沟里，藏着这么一位人才！”
    老冯则说：“在当今改革的大潮中，既有胆识又能抓住机遇不放的‘弄潮儿’，不是很多，吴修和算是其中的一个。这真应了武夷山九曲溪山灵水秀的典故。”
    说这些话的地点，是在南平造纸厂宽敞漂亮的迎宾大厅；说这些话的时间，是作家们参观了南平造纸厂之后。当我们作家一行十余人，尾随着高大魁梧的吴修和，从造纸厂的贮木水坞和现代化的造纸车间归来，便吐出了这片肺腑真言。
    与我们同访武夷山的海外华裔作家陈若曦，神色尤显激动。她坐在迎宾大厅的椅子上，手拿扩音器，直接对吴修和抒发她的心声说：
  “吴先生，请接受我这个炎黄子孙对你的敬意。你把拥有几千名职工的造纸厂，造就成一个文明的小社会，足见你的才智超群。我一向不会阿谀奉承，说的话毫不夸张。”大约陈若曦的话说得动情而诚挚，在迎宾大厅里赢得热烈的掌声。吴修和忙站起身来，拱手抱拳，不失礼貌地答谢陈若曦的鼓励。
    这一瞬间，作家们的目光都投向了吴修和。他不仅身材伟岸，还具有男子汉的堂堂仪表，那身深蓝色的西装上没有一个皱纹，那条鲜红领带的结，打得圆鼓而方正。偶尔，他流露出一丝微笑，笑纹里展现着优秀企业家都具有的那种恭谦和宽容；间或，他若有所思地闭合上嘴唇，一种坚毅和自信便从他严肃的口纹中闪烁而出，具有一种企业家的魅力。
        奇特的改革“魔方”
    随着“砸烂一切”年代的结束，新闻、教育和文化出版界，就在呼唤着它的传播媒介——造纸工业了。
  　被冰冻了十年的文化，从历史新时期开始，像返青的草芽，由枯黄而转为青绿，文化对纸的需求量成倍地猛增。吴修和就是在这个时刻——1983年1月，出任武夷山怀抱中的南平造纸厂第七任厂长的。
    南平造纸厂的纸产量，居全国第三位。它的历史贡献，是向全国各大报刊提供了新闻用纸：南起江浙皖粤，北至京津沪宁，都在南纸的供应范围之内。1983年、1984年报刊的印刷发行量大增，各地对纸的需求，既给刚上任的吴修和带来巨大压力，也给一个改革者提供了施展才能的历史契机。吴修和在这座风险舞台上，演出了一场震惊造纸行业的戏剧。在这出戏里，没有布尔乔亚式的浪漫，也没有虚幻空灵的诗章——造纸需要机器，吴修和干的是和庞然大物打交道的事情，这出戏就是改造主宰南平纸厂命运的“一号纸机”。“一号纸机”是南纸厂的主机，而吴修和提出的改革方案是：停机翻新。
      来参加厂务扩大会议的，都是造纸行家和工程技术人员，都是和吴修和在一起已经滚了多年的老搭档，虽然都知道解决“一号纸机”，是南纸腾飞的关键，但对停产翻新“一号”疑虑重重。很明显，停产影响着全年任务的完成，这些精灵鬼按照更换机械设备的常规计算了一下：土建工程加上引进设备，耗资巨大尚且不说，仅委托设备制造厂承包工程设计、订货、安装、试车等几大项目，就要折腾光南平纸厂的家底，还要向国家贷上一大笔钱，一旦试车失败，南纸厂的前景是什么，大家心里非常清楚。因而，都对吴修和的方案表示沉默。
    吴修和十分理解老伙伴们的心情，他在五十年代和这些老搭档参与过“一号纸机”的安装、试车、投产。这台造纸机上每个机械部件，甚至小到一个螺丝钉，都和每个会议参加者有着深厚的感情；但他知道八十年代不是怀旧和感伤的年代，严酷的竞争，要求人们从怀旧的情怀中裂变出来，并敢于把握风险的契机，企业才有可能生存发展。就像一个新生婴儿诞生时，总是要伴随着母体的阵痛一样。
      “怎么样？大家表态呀！”身材高大的吴修和内心虽然翻江倒海，脸上仍不失固有的平静和从容，“一号纸机”每天在50—60吨产量中徘徊，我们已适应不了文化对纸张的需求，除了破釜沉舟，给一号大换血，我们没有别的路可走了！”
      “年度生产计划怎么完成？”终于有人耐不住令人窒息的沉默，提出了内心的忧虑，“这一枪打出去，能扛回一头猎物来也值得，要是让老虎咬折了枪口呢？”
      “只要‘一号’翻新，产量还能从‘新一号’上拿回来？”第二位发言人说，“只是更新‘一号’的总体构想，究竟有多大的成功系数，老吴，这事情关联到全局。”
    吴修和用心上那杆秤掂了掂，两位副手谈的貌似两个问题，其实是一个问题，都是忧虑风险太大，深怕马失前蹄，落个难以收拾残局的下场。
      其实，怀着这种忧虑的不只是他的副手们，就连他妻子爱珍，也为他决心更换“一号纸机”的构想而惶惶不安。她既不愿丈夫当个每日悠哉游哉无所作为的厂长，又深为丈夫这步险棋担心。夜深人静时，她对他耳语说：“最稳妥的办法，是进一条西方先进的造纸生产线。”
      吴修和开玩笑地回答妻子说：“你和外国厂商的口吻一样。前几天，日本三菱公司和奥地利伏特公司的代表，来厂里商谈业务时，都劝我引进一套先进生产线，既省心，又省力。他们还说：‘吴先生，这厂子也不是你个人的，何必冒那么大风险，搞没有把握的改革呢？’我说：‘对不起，我们国家还很穷，花那么多外汇，我们良心上有愧。我们的方案，是少花钱，还要办大事。’爱珍，你想想，要是走这条不担风险的路，将来还要请个‘洋保姆’来当教师爷，我们中国工程技术人员，这么多年都白吃干饭了？！”
      “可是你能说服同志们吗？”妻子仍然疑虑忡忡。
      “能。我努力去说服。”
      正像妻子预料的那样，厂务会议开得并不顺利。吴修和只好控制着自己满腹的焦躁情绪，以冷静和自信再次阐述他的构想：“这个改革方案从宏观上讲，既非小修小补、小打小闹，因为那解决不了企业的生存和发展问题；也非整套引进西方先进设备。我们的路，是一条别人没有走过的路，而把西方造纸机械的百家所长，分别拿来嫁接到‘一号’上，使‘一号’成为‘博采众长，撷零为整’的新型造纸机。这样就可以少花外汇，而获得好的效果，杂交符合优生学，叫南纸厂生个大金娃娃！”接着，吴修和凭着近三十年积累的造纸技术，把“博采众长，而弃其短”的战略构想，做了充分论述。他神色激动地说：“根据我们几次出国考察的技术数据积累，这个风险值得我们去冒一下。趟地雷我带头，出了问题我摘乌纱帽。今天，我不强求同志们同意我的构想，但也不能总议而不决。三次会议定方圆。散会！”
      大胆设想伴随着精确的论据，历经三次会议，吴修和别出心裁的改革方案，终于使伙伴们折服。他的副手们有的补充吴修和构想的不足，有的对构想提出合理化建议。经过缜密研究，一致认为：要实现对“一号”的彻底改造，首先面临的是和外商谈判购置能优化“一号”的各国机械部件，这是个十分烦琐和棘手的问题。经技术人员预测，改装“一号”设备总拆装量约为1200吨，要敷设电缆25公里，还需土建工程（扩大厂房）4600平米。工作量相当之大，难题非常之多，但这些困难，对于在1953年就投身到造纸行业，并历任过基建科长、设备工艺科长、车间副主任、扩建工程指挥、副厂长直至厂长的吴修和来说，认为这正是南纸厂实现突破的历史机遇。
      “干！”吴修和吐出了这铁铮铮一个字。或马失前蹄而身败名裂，或使“南纸”升华到一个新的历史高度。吴修和义无反顾地登上了这座风险舞台。
            机智的谈判能手
    接连而来的是和一连串的外商进行引进机械部件的谈判，吴修和风趣地称之为和“八国联军打仗”。值得称道的是，吴修和不仅是个有胆识的改革家，还是个机智的谈判能手。他在论述企业家不但要能大刀阔斧，还必须处处精打细算时，有过一段小小的自述说：“我小时候很穷，在舅舅家开的米店帮过忙，我既看见过他珍惜掉在地上的一粒米，也见过舅舅用一叠叠票子买进卖出，赚来更多的票子。”舅舅对他的影响很深，因而吴修和十分厌恶某些企业家摆阔的恶俗。尽管南平造纸是福建省创利税的首富——年利税7000万元左右，但吴修和在和外商的谈判桌上，在出国购置“一号”机械部件的日子，他仍然珍惜每一块美元，把一块美元掰成两瓣花。
    有一次吴修和率技术小组，赴北京同奥地利的客商谈判引进“一号”设备问题。谈判地点设在西郊的“中技公司”，而吴修和和他的伙伴不住宾馆饭店，住在远离“中技公司”的东城一家招待所。出门不坐“的士”，天天乘公共汽车，为躲开北京的上下班高峰，吴修和和小组成员，每天要早起迟归。午饭他带大家吃小摊，饭后，他躺到街心公园上去打个小盹，这是为了下午谈判充满精力。奥地利客商哥朗德先生，在背后风趣地称他为“中国虎”。是的，在谈判桌上，吴修和全神贯注，每个细节都不放过。事先他总是了解甲方公司的各种状况，因而极善心理攻坚。哥朗德先生的代理人是香港某洋行的丘老板，他说：“吴厂长总是想熊掌和鱼兼得，既要买名牌，又吝啬腰包里的钱。天下的便宜都叫你给占去了。”
      即使这样，吴修和仍嫌不足。就是在这次谈判的晚上，当他和伙伴们在公共汽车上谈起购置粗渣机得失时，有人认为这台机器还应再往下压价。吴修和回到住所，就给丘老板打电话，请他务必来他们住所一趟。丘先生应召赶来，听吴修和说还要对粗渣机降价时，他苦不堪言地说：“刚才的意向合同里已经明确了价钱，怎么……”吴修和说：“叫哥朗德先生再附加给我们一台测量仪吧，否则今后生意难继续做下去了。咱们又不是一锤子的买卖！”丘先生和哥朗德先生商量后，终于同意附加给南纸厂一台价值几万美元的测量仪。
      吴修和之所以寸土必争，敢于向对方提出超越常规的要求，其原因就是知己知彼。他深知，哥朗德先生的伏特公司的产品，正急于在中国打开市场。十几年来，该公司产品在中国销售不畅，特别是前不久，该公司和美国伯乐公司向中国一家造纸厂兜售机械的竞争中，“伏特”败于“伯乐”之下。吴修和以其独具的慧眼，识破哥朗德兜售产品的焦灼心态，便一攻再攻，并连连获胜。事后，哥朗德先生惊呼：“吴先生，真是没有比你再精明的厂长了。你的纸厂，一定会创中国之优。”
      之后，是和日本三菱、加拿大詹生、瑞士BBC、英国亨特、西德亚根诺、美国亚丘利的七家，进行连续四十天的车轮大战。
    每每谈判之前，吴修和以及他的助手，都要连夜翻阅各公司的翔实资料，以寻求各式各样的谈判对策。吴修和在引进西德亚根诺公司生产的世界名牌复卷机时，他先迫使这个从不降价出售机械产品的亚根诺代表，让价5％，后又让价到8％。明码标价四十万美元一台的名牌产品，所以能对吴修和连连让价，是亚根诺经理敬佩吴修和对该机械性能谙熟于胸。他说：“这样精通业务的行家，使用敝公司的产品，是敝公司的光荣。你是赏识敝公司产品的中国第一位造纸厂长，相信能为我们的名牌货广为宣传！”瞧，神奇的谈判，获得了神奇的效果。只有吴修和的助手们，才知道他们厂长为打赢每一场战争，为节约国家每一块美元，翻阅资料常常熬得两眼通红。
      用不着说，堂堂的福建首富在这四十天不知疲倦的奋战中，天天住简陋的招待所，天天挤公共汽车，天天吃路旁的小饭摊，天天要在公园的长椅上午歇。即或是谈判轮空的日子，助手们也不能去大街上看一场电影，吴修和精神就是连续作战的同意语，四十个日日夜夜的一分一秒都是为了打赢对“八国联军”谈判桌上的“战争”。
    谈判时的吴修和是这幅模样，出国考察时的吴修和也是这样。他人高马大，步履匆匆。有一次考察团在美国洛杉矶落脚，团员们都知道这儿有世界闻名的迪斯尼乐园。可是谁也不敢向吴修和提出。倒是吴修和看出了团员们的心机，他诙谐而幽默地说：“现在咱们是条饥饿的汉子，出国来就是用知识填满肚子。要是等将来咱们国家也像美国一样富足的时候，我个人出资请你们逛迪斯尼。”
      1984年5月《杭州日报》邀请吴修和商谈问题。会后，《杭州日报》满怀感激之情，请吴修和游览西湖。这是吴修和生平第一次到杭州来，但他婉言谢绝了。事后南平造纸厂接到《杭州日报》一封感谢信，信中对吴修和一身正气和耿耿公心，表示钦佩。他们在信中感叹地写道：这样廉正的大企业家在中国，并不多见。
      就在这样一位造纸“元帅”的率领下，“一号”纸机的彻底翻新——包括土建、拆迁、安装，直到试车，总共只停产了57天时间。“优化杂交”后的“新一号”纸机日产纸量最高数字达到100吨，比“老一号”的产量翻了一番。“新一号”在全国同类纸机中产量跃居到前茅。
    全厂为之雀跃！全厂为之欢呼！
    吴修和多少个不眠之夜的辛劳，在这里得到了补偿。因为在年度报表中清清楚楚地写着，“新一号”造纸机一年为国家多生产8000多吨性能优良的新闻纸。由于是电脑控制，每吨新闻纸比“旧一号”可以多出1100张报纸。
    吴修和没有在成绩中陶醉，他的脚下永远是零，他和他的伙伴，马不停蹄地于1987年2月17日又吹响改造“二号纸机”的进军号。有了“一号”翻新的经验，“二号”的改造工作进度顺利，他们分别从美国、西德、日本、英国购进机械部件，用两个月的时间，组装了“新二号”。“新一号”和“新二号”像是飞机的两翼，带动了南平造纸厂历史性的腾飞。经过精确统计，从吴修和出任厂长的1983年，南纸厂以每年万吨的增长速度递增。经有关专家认定“新一、二号”纸机造出的“星光牌”新闻纸，可与国外胶印新闻纸质量相媲美，从而获得省优部优产品称号。昔日只知埋头苦干、名不见经传的吴修和，在改革的风云年代，成为福建省及全国造纸行业中声名遐迩的人物；南平造纸厂荣获1988年全国五一劳动奖状。
      一个严以律己的新型企业家
      吴修和对我说，“南平造纸厂能有今天的突破，是前六任厂长成绩积累，是现在五名厂领导班子共同奋斗的结果——我们五个人都具有各自的专业技术。”
      这个由内行凝聚在一起的领导班子，高瞻远瞩，瞄准了人才的开发。按照吴修和的说法：目前的企业竞争，归根到底是人才实力的竞争。基于这样的认识，纸厂对职工进行科技教育时不惜血本，经过精密统计，截止到1988年厂内教育经费高达413万元（仅1987年用于科技教育就花掉96万元）。
      目前的南平造纸厂形成了从小学、中学、技校到大专班（包括电大）系统的培训教育网络（包括全厂闭路电视的教育培训）。全厂培训人员8603人次，覆盖面占应培训人员的91％。经子弟学校培养教育出来的青年，有235人考取了大专院校，168人考取了中等专业学校，还有22人正在攻读博士和硕士研究生。
      十年树木，百年树人。南平造纸厂领导班子，面对竞争的世界，敞开了博大宏伟的襟怀。当我们作家一行，在南平造纸厂参观时，处处可见该厂展露出来向现代化企业迈步的姿容：厂房和厂房、车间和车间之间，都是绿地和花坛。据吴修和告诉我，全厂绿化面积覆盖率为70％，栽种约2.5万株（棵）各色花木。特别引人注目的是那座占地3400平米的漂亮的文化楼，楼内开设图书、阅览、游艺、电视、桌球和艺术沙龙活动室，还有音乐厅和舞厅。可惜，我们在厂内参观时，适逢在工人紧张的劳作时间之内；但我们从厂内录像的屏幕上，还是看见了南纸职工五彩缤纷的文化生活，从管弦乐队的演出到时髦的迪斯科舞潮……
      “老吴，你要是跳起舞来，一定具有非凡的魅力！”我说。
    他摇摇头：“我不会跳。”
      “你……”
    “我什么都不会，不会打麻将，不会打扑克，不会……我只会吸烟，但是自从走马上任当了厂长的那一天，我把烟也戒掉了！”
      “噢？”我有些惊愕。
      “说实在的，我没有时间玩。”他苦笑一声说，“但我要求自己必须具有鲜明的时代意识。在这一点上，我的脑袋和我身子是分离的，我认为重要的是脑袋，如果一个厂长的脑袋没有对当今世界的认识和把握，就很难进入现代化企业的竞争行列；而企业文化和企业文明，是现代化企业赖以发展的鲜红血液。”
      “说得太对了。”我连连点头。
      “为了这一点，我们厂内有个卫星地面接收站。”吴修和侃侃而谈，“虽然我们身子在这武夷山的山沟沟里，眼睛时刻盯着世界的科技潮流。”
    这正是吴修和在严酷的工业竞争中，所以能不断开拓之根本所在。他是五十年代成长起来的知识分子。尊重科学，尊重知识，并在科学和知识中不断汲吸养分，反过来发展并开拓科学和知识，这是他立于不败之地的治厂魔方。当然，更为重要的是，吴修和有一颗振兴民族的灼热的心。他告诉我，使他立下把南平变成新型纸都雄心的人，是曾留学美国、专攻造纸的老专家金瀚。当吴修和还是年轻后生时，老工程师金瀚向他讲过这么一段经历：金总在美国缅州大学即将毕业归国时，有一次他向全班同学畅叙了回国造纸的梦想。金瀚站在讲台上，用教鞭在地球仪上，指着像金鸡唱晓一样的中国地图说：“回国之后，我一定竭尽全力建立起中国的纸都。这儿是大小兴安岭，这儿是西双版纳，这儿是闽南林带……”同学们对他的伟大抱负投以讥笑，就连平日最喜欢他的格兰德教授，都提醒他说：“中国是造纸的鼻祖，我尊重你对祖国的真情。但现在中国是军阀割据、民不聊生的地方，恐怕难于实现你的抱负！”
    金瀚回国了，他四方奔走，八方游说，并雇了个向导，到大西南林区长途勘探。但他心上的那张造纸蓝图，到底还是被日本侵略中国的炮声撕裂了，直到新中国成立之后，他才在闽江三大支流汇合处——南平，兑现了他在美国留学时的造纸之梦。
    这个老知识分子为振兴民族的一片赤诚，对吴修和影响极深。由此也塑造了他的理想。这个理想就是把南平变成一座现代化的纸都。
    站在造纸厂的水坞上，我曾询及老吴，为什么在水里泡着那么多的木头。吴修和说：“这是我们的水上贮木场，大约存有几万方的木材。这是考虑到造纸原料会越来越奇缺，早就储存下的。古人有训：兵马未动，粮草先行嘛！”
    又是一个超前行动。但我想到这些木材也只能解决目前一两年的问题，便询问道：“将来怎么办？”
      “1988年，我们和附近的一市四县，成立了专为解决南纸原料的营林公司。保存了大片森林，这是为了解决‘南纸’的远忧。”吴修和叹了口气说，“说实在的，这些措施都难以解决造纸原料的根本不足问题。你也知道，中国林业资料十分贫乏，我们正在把一只眼睛从森林移开，瞄准另外一条造纸之路。”
      “又有了新招？”我很惊讶。“这条路我坚信能走得通。正在等待国家计委审议批准立项。”吴修和充满自信地，向我讲述了他的造纸畅想……
    其实，吴修和没有什么特别的，有的只是一种振兴中华的责任感和为既定目标进行百折不挠的拚搏精神。这种精神像磁石一样，吸引并铸造着“南纸”的新一代。现任该厂副厂长的陈云麟，1964年毕业于上海轻工业学院，上级领导调他去当县长，他婉言谢绝。陈云麟说：“我生活的目标是献身造纸，像吴厂长那样干出一番事业来。”加上厂内无论老工人和年轻工人，对吴修和的开拓精神十分尊重，因而这种精神，很容易化为南平造纸厂职工的共同财富。当然，有人的地方就有矛盾，吴修和有时也难逃这种羁绊：有一次，开厂务扩大会议，桌上的一只梨子掉落下来，一直滚到吴修和脚下，吴修和弯腰把梨子拾起来放在桌子上。于是有人半开玩笑地说：“看见了吗，连梨子都往老吴那边滚！”吴修和对此一贯以豁达的胸襟对之。
      他严格律己，总是反躬自问自己的不足，使矛盾得以缓解或消除。厂长秘书黄宗雄告诉过我：“有一次，开党小组会，我看他抓全厂大事太累了，就没有通知他。他狠狠地批评了我一顿，并在党小组会上进行了自我批评。像这样主管几千人大厂全面工作的人，对自己要求又这么严的，真是难以寻觅！”
