A Controversy Over "Yu"

Gu Jiegang was the leading figure of the "Ancient History Debate School." He shattered the long-established ancient history system, proposing that the history before the Qin and Han dynasties was subjectively reconstructed by people during the Warring States, Qin, and Han periods. He asserted that there was no Pangu, nor were there the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors in history. Based on the "Shuowen Jiezi" which states, "Yu, an insect, with the radical wind, pictographic," he suspected that "Yu" was an animal from ancient myths, which was later associated by our ancestors with the hero who tamed the floods. Whether his conclusion is accurate is not important; the key point is that his shocking statement challenged the ancient history view that had been unquestioned for thousands of years, immediately sparking both praise and criticism, with some people finding it hard to accept.

Kuomintang official Chen Lifu often ridiculed Mr. Gu Jiegang in his speeches, saying, "Gu Jiegang says that Yu the Great is an insect," to elicit laughter from the audience.

In 1940, in Chengdu, the Deputy Minister of Education, Gu Yushu, visited Mr. Gu Jiegang and asked about the birthday of Yu. He replied, "Yu is a mythical figure; whether he existed is still uncertain. How can we verify his birthday? It's just that the people in the western Sichuan area, where the Qiang people live, are accustomed to celebrating Yu's birthday on the sixth day of the sixth month, and the sacrifices are quite lively." The speaker meant no harm, but the listener had other intentions. Some days later, people saw news that the Kuomintang government had decided to hold the Engineer's Day on the sixth day of the sixth month. A special issue of the newspaper also featured an article by Chen Lifu, which stated: "Yu the Great taming the floods is the first major event in the history of Chinese engineering. Now, Mr. Gu Jiegang has verified that Yu's birthday is the sixth day of the sixth month, so we have decided to make this day the Engineer's Day." Chen Lifu's words put Mr. Gu Jiegang in a difficult position. At that time, Professor Miao Fenglin from Central University wrote an article criticizing him for being "two-faced," denying the existence of Yu while also confirming his birthday. Even after liberation, Mr. Gu Jiegang still harbored resentment over this incident.

    一场关于“禹”的风波
    顾颉刚是“古史辩学派”的掌旗人物，他打破了长期沿用的古史体系，提出先秦的历史是战国秦汉人主观改造的历史，历史上既没有盘古，也没有三皇五帝。他据《说文》
  “禹，虫也，从风，象形”，怀疑“禹”是古代神话里的动物，被我们的先民附会为治水的功臣。他的结论本身是否精当倒是不重要的，问题是他这一石破天惊的说法打破了上千年来没有人敢怀疑的古史观，一时毁誉蜂起，一些人感到无法接受。
    国民政府要人陈立夫经常在演讲中讥讽颉刚先生，说“顾颉刚说大禹是一条虫呢”，以博得听众的一笑。
    1940年，在成都，教育部政务次长顾毓琇来拜访颉刚先生，问到禹的生日可不可考，他回答说：“禹是神话里的人物，有无其人尚不能定，何以去考证他的生日来呢，只不过川西羌人居住的地方，人们习惯以六月六日为禹的生日，祭祀还很热闹。”说者无心，听者有意，过了些日子，人们看到国民政府定于六月六日举行工程师节的新闻，报纸上还出现了特刊，载有陈立夫的一篇演说，说：“大禹治水是我国工程史上的第一件大事，现在禹的生日已由顾颉刚先生考证出来了，是六月六日，所以我们就定这一天为工程师节。”陈立夫的话使顾颉刚先生背了黑锅，当时中央大学的缪风林教授就写文章骂他“首鼠两端”，既否认禹的存在，又确定他的生日。直到解放以后，顾颉刚先生想起这事，心中仍有余怨。
