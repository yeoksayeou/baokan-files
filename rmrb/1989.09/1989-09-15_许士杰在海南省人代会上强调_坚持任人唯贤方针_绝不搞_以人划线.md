Xu Shijie, Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, emphasized today at the third session of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress that Hainan must always adhere to the principle of selecting the best talent from all walks of life. Regardless of who recommends or appoints the cadres, their performance is the key factor, and we must not draw lines based on personal connections.

Xu Shijie said that most cadres in Hainan have reservations and even resist some of Liang Xiang's erroneous practices in his work. There is no necessary connection between Liang Xiang's mistakes and the cadres who are closely related to him, including those transferred in with his approval, as well as those who have worked in Hainan for a long time. The vast majority of cadres are good and reliable.

Xu Shijie said that Liang Xiang's abuse of power for personal gain is a serious mistake. The decision to handle Liang Xiang fully reflects the Party Central Committee and the State Council's resolve to govern the Party strictly, maintain integrity, and combat corruption. It shows that no matter how senior or high-ranking a Communist Party member or state official is, or how great their merits are, they must abide by the laws of the state. If they violate laws and disciplines, they will be dealt with.

Xu Shijie pointed out that we must draw profound lessons from the mistakes and causes of Liang Xiang's errors, use them as a warning, and strengthen the construction of clean government in Hainan. Hainan is at the forefront of opening up to the outside world. Every Communist Party member, every cadre, especially those Party leaders who hold certain powers, must maintain the character of a Communist Party member and serve as a good public servant. They must be clean and upright, abide by party and state disciplines, place themselves under the supervision and management of the Party organization, and under the supervision of the people, and wholeheartedly serve the people.

　　许士杰在海南省人代会上强调
　　坚持任人唯贤方针
　　绝不搞“以人划线”
    新华社海口9月14日电　（记者陈江）中共海南省委书记、省人代会主任许士杰今天在海南省人民代表会议第三次会议上强调，海南要始终坚持五湖四海、任人唯贤的用人方针，不论是谁推荐任用的干部，都重在看他的表现，绝不搞“以人划线”。
    许士杰说，海南多数干部对梁湘同志在工作上的一些错误作法是有意见的，有的是抵制的。梁湘同志犯错误和与他关系较密切的干部，包括经他同意调进的干部，以及长期在海南工作的干部，没有必然联系。绝大多数干部是好的，是可以信赖的。
  许士杰说，梁湘同志以权谋私，错误是严重的。对梁湘同志的处理决定充分体现了党中央、国务院从严治党、廉洁清正、惩治腐败的决心，说明了共产党员、国家干部，不管资格多老、地位多高，功劳多大，都必须遵守国家的法律，如违法犯纪，必受到处理。
    许士杰指出，要从梁湘同志所犯的错误及原因中吸取深刻的教训，引以为戒，搞好海南的廉政建设。海南处于对外开放的最前沿，每一位共产党员，每一个干部，特别是掌握着一定权力的党员领导干部，都要保持共产党员的本色，当好人民的公仆。要廉洁奉公，遵守党纪政纪，把自己置于党组织的监督和管理之下，置于人民群众的监督之下，全心全意为人民服务。
