Recently, the Party branch and village committee of Beicun in Wannan Town, Shandong's Xintai City, have gained the favor of the villagers by openly handling administrative affairs and doing several things in accordance with public opinion. These matters include:

Open distribution of profits. Beicun has 8 enterprises with an annual profit of around 60,000 yuan. Because the profit distribution situation was never made public, some villagers mistakenly believed that the money all went into the leaders' pockets. The secretary of the village Party branch thought that it was not the villagers' fault for complaining; this showed that their work lacked transparency. Therefore, the village set up a public bulletin board for clean governance, publicly displaying all financial accounts of village-run enterprises. Some villagers said, "We really didn't know the village had invested so much in collective funds and levies for us."

Open distribution of fertilizers. Previously, there were issues of unfairness in the village's allocation of fertilizer quotas, which made the villagers very dissatisfied. To place the allocation of fertilizer quotas under public supervision, the village leaders decided to distribute quotas based on the number of households and population, and publicly post the allocation plan. In the first half of this year, the entire village received 7,159.5 kilograms of grain-linked fertilizers, all of which were delivered to the farmers without any shortage.

Publicize "hot" issues. In recent years, the Party branch and village committee of Beicun have made public the village's financial income and expenditure, the allocation of fertilizers and diesel, family planning, and the approval of residential land, which are the most concerning issues for the villagers. To ensure that the public has a place to voice their opinions, they also set up a "reporting box." The village leaders pay great attention to the opinions collected in the reporting box, responding to each one. Based on the villagers' reports, the village has investigated and dealt with 10 cases of violations of family planning policies.

　　顺乎民意的事
    最近，山东新泰市汶南镇北村党支部和村民委员会由于政务公开，办了几件顺民意的事，因而受到村民的欢迎。这些事主要是：
    利润分配公开。汶南北村有8个企业，年利润6万元左右。因为一直没有公开利润分配情况，所以一些村民误认为钱都进了头头的腰包。村党支部书记认为，不怪群众发牢骚，这说明他们工作的透明度不够。于是，村里专设了廉政建设公布栏，把村办企业一切财务收支帐目张榜公布。有的村民说：“俺以前真不知村里为俺垫上了这么多集资款、提留款。”
    化肥分配公开。以前，村里分配化肥指标确有不公之处，群众很不满意。为把化肥指标分配置于群众监督之下，村领导决定按户数、人口分配化肥指标，并把分配方案张榜公布。今年上半年，全村按上级分配的7159.5公斤粮食挂钩化肥，一两不少的兑现到农民手中。
    公开“热点”问题。这几年，北村党支部和村委会将村里的财务收支情况，化肥、柴油的分配情况，计划生育、宅基地审批等村民最关心的热点问题都公开了。为了使群众意见有地方提，还特设“举报箱”。村领导对举报箱内收集的意见很重视，件件有回音。根据群众举报，村里就查处了10起违反计划生育的人。
