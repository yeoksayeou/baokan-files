On the morning of August 29, 200 young and vibrant soldiers stood at the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square, raising their hands to take an oath. Afterwards, they participated in a voluntary labor activity to tidy up the lawn. Many passersby looked at them with admiration.

These soldiers were representatives of the Communist Youth League members from a unit of the General Staff Engineering Corps.

They attended the first batch of Youth League membership certificate awarding ceremony in Tiananmen Square and held an activity themed "Love the Party, Love the Motherland."

Liu Jinxing, the Political Department Director of the unit, told the reporter that to make political and ideological work lively, attractive, and full of charm, the unit's leadership had put a lot of thought into it and developed a set of fresh experiences.

In recent years, various ideologies in society have been constantly changing, making it difficult for even veteran political workers to keep up. The leaders of this unit, through careful analysis and consideration, proposed the principle of primarily inheriting and innovating opportunities for political and ideological work. They organized officers and soldiers to seriously study the works of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, helping everyone to establish a communist worldview and firmly walk the socialist path.

This unit is responsible for the maintenance and support of key national projects, and most of the soldiers live in deep mountain valleys with very harsh living conditions.

In recent years, the unit's leadership has done everything possible to improve the soldiers' living conditions while persistently conducting education on hard work and self-reliance.

The leaders lead by example, taking pride in hardship, and the soldiers also consciously endure hardships and make selfless contributions.

Two soldiers guarding a certain post in the deep mountains have not seen television for years, cannot eat fresh vegetables, and can only read newspapers once every ten days or half a month, but they have no complaints and voluntarily stand guard for the country and the people. In their spare time, they seize the opportunity to study, using knowledge to fill the void in their lives. Their efforts paid off, and recently, these two soldiers were both admitted to a military academy, becoming scholars in the army.

Inheriting primarily does not mean sticking to old rules. Seizing opportunities, they come up with new methods.

Nowadays, the "army, family, society" three-in-one education method, which is famous throughout the military, was implemented by this unit in 1987.

In this unit, political and ideological work is no longer a simple "you hit me, I hit you" form, but has become an invisible bridge connecting the hearts of officers and soldiers. Officers take it as an important part of their political and ideological work to help soldiers solve problems and difficulties, doing everything possible to do practical things and good deeds for the soldiers.

In July of this year, some areas in Sichuan experienced floods. Many soldiers from Sichuan in the unit were so anxious that they could not eat or sleep.

The unit's leadership, on one hand, comforted the soldiers and stabilized military morale, and on the other hand, sent an officer to quickly go to the disaster area to understand the situation of the soldiers' families.

After understanding the situation, they actively contacted the local civil affairs department and jointly discussed disaster relief measures. The officers' actions made the "superiority of the socialist system and collective spirit" that they often talk about come to life and warm the soldiers' hearts. Many soldiers whose families were affected by the disaster not only did not become pessimistic and discouraged, but also worked hard in the unit.

The Engineering Corps unit is scattered, making it difficult to gather. The unit's leadership, taking into account local conditions, created many thought work methods suitable for this characteristic.

They helped each company establish well-equipped clubs, holding monthly characteristic cultural and sports activities, and carrying out various competitions and evaluations.

With more dispersed activities, the enthusiasm of grassroots officers and soldiers has been fully mobilized, and everyone is competing to do their best.

The leaders of this unit believe that the purpose of political and ideological work is to cultivate a group of new communists and stabilize military morale.

In recent years, although they have not won many glorious honors, the soldiers generally feel that the leaders here are full of human touch, and the life here is full of sunshine.

    继承·创新
    ——总参工程兵某部思想政治工作散记
    本报记者　袁建达
    8月29日上午，北京天安门广场迎来了200位英姿勃发的战士。他们在人民英雄纪念碑前举手宣誓，接着又认真地参加整理草坪的义务劳动。许多行人向他们投去赞赏的目光。
    这批战士是总参工程兵某部的共青团员代表。
    他们在天安门广场参加了首批团员证颁发仪式，同时举行了“热爱党、热爱祖国”的活动。
    部队政治处主任刘金兴告诉记者，为了把思想政治工作做得生动活泼、富有魅力，部队领导动了很多脑筋，摸索出一套新鲜经验。
    这几年，社会上各种思潮花样翻新，令人目不暇接。思想政治工作究竟怎样做？连干了一辈子的老政工也犯了愁。这支部队的领导通过仔细分析、惦量，提出了思想政治工作以继承为主，找准机会就创新的方针。他们组织干部战士认真学习毛泽东、周恩来、邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家的著作，帮助大家树立共产主义人生观，坚定不移地走社会主义道路。
    这支部队担负着国家重点工程的维修、保障任务，战士们大多居住在深山沟，生活条件十分艰苦。
    这几年，部队领导一方面想尽办法改善战士的生活，一方面坚持不懈地进行艰苦奋斗的教育。
    领导身先士卒，带头以苦为荣，战士们也自觉吃苦，无私奉献。
    守护在深山某哨位的两名战士，长年看不到电视，吃不到新鲜蔬菜，报纸十天半月才能读到，但他们毫无怨言，自觉为祖国和人民站岗。空闲时，他们就抓紧时间学习，用知识的甘泉填补生活的空白。功夫不负有心人，前不久，这两名战士双双考入军校，成为军中秀才。
    以继承为主，并不是固守陈规。找准机会，他们就拿出新办法。
    如今闻名全军的“部队、家庭、社会”三结合教育法，这个部队于1987年就实行了。
    在这个部队，思想政治工作已经不是简单地“你打我通”的形式，而是变成了联接干部和战士心田的无形桥梁。干部们把为战士排忧解难作为思想政治工作的一项重要内容，千方百计为战士做实事、办好事。
    今年7月，四川一些地区发生水灾。部队中的许多四川籍战士急得吃不下饭、睡不稳觉。
    部队领导一面安慰战士、稳定军心，一面派一名干部火速赶到灾区了解战士家里的情况。
    情况摸清后，主动与当地民政部门联系，共商救灾办法。干部的行动，把平时挂在嘴边的“社会主义制度优越性、集体主义精神”形象化了，温暖了战士的心。很多家中受灾的战士不仅没有悲观失望，反而安心部队工作。
    工程兵部队驻地分散，不易集中。部队领导因地制宜，创造出不少适合这种特点的思想工作方法。
    他们帮助各个营建立了设备齐全的俱乐部，每个月都开展富有特色的文体活动，还开展了各种各样的竞赛、评比。
    分散活动多了，基层干部和战士的积极性得到了充分的发挥，大家都比着劲干。
    这个部队的领导认为，做思想政治工作的目的，是培养一批共产主义新人，稳定军心。
    近几年，他们虽然没有获得多少显赫的荣誉，但战士们普遍感到这儿的领导富有人情味，这儿的生活充满阳光。
