Bulgaria, known for its agricultural prowess, has faced sluggish agricultural development since the mid-1980s, even experiencing a decline. In 1985, the national grain production was only half of what it was in 1984, and the supply of agricultural and sideline products and fruits and vegetables in the market began to tighten.

There are objective reasons for the decline in agriculture. In 1985, the country experienced a severe drought that had not been seen in many years. In the following years, it encountered spring frosts, autumn floods, and early snowstorms. However, in terms of the overall development of agriculture, the old management system, irrational economic relations, and extensive management models have always been the main factors weakening the vitality of agricultural development. In response to this situation, Comrade Todor Zhivkov, General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, proposed a comprehensive set of measures for reforming the agricultural production system and a general blueprint for developing agriculture in the new era in the past and current years.

Reorganize the agro-industrial complexes and implement corporatization

The agro-industrial complexes are a type of agricultural organization established in the 1970s that combine political and economic functions. Due to their large scale, rigid management methods, low efficiency, and difficulty in mobilizing the enthusiasm of farmers, Bulgaria has gradually dissolved each complex into several collective farms starting this year and introduced industrial management models to implement the corporatization of agricultural organizations. The basic units engaged in agricultural activities within collective farms are work teams, which are the direct operators of land and agricultural production materials. Work teams implement independent accounting and self-sufficiency; they enter into contractual relationships with superiors, subordinates, and peers; the leaders of work teams are elected by differential voting; the wage and bonus distribution system is abolished, and a remuneration method is implemented where personal income is linked to the final labor results (products).

Widely implement the contract and lease system

After the 13th Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1986, Bulgaria began to implement the contract system. However, the scope of contracting was small, and the term was short. Now, Bulgaria decides to expand the contract system to all agricultural sectors and activities nationwide. The contract period is also extended from 10 years to 50 years. The forms of contracting include work teams, groups, families, and individual contracting, with various types. At the same time, land, orchards, livestock farms, and other facilities are leased. The rent can be paid in cash, in kind, or a combination of both. The state does not restrict the methods by which contractors and lessees sell agricultural products. To prevent speculative behavior during the contracting and leasing process, the government stipulates that contractors and lessees are not allowed to transfer land or agricultural production materials.

"Green light" for individual and family farms

Bulgaria's newly enacted land law formally recognizes the right of individuals or families to establish farms. The land for the farms is obtained through lease contracts signed with the village government. Tractors, seeders, and combine harvesters can be purchased with loans or rented from collective farm machinery stations. Individual farms or family farms can hire up to 10 agricultural workers through labor contracts as long as they are registered with the district court. The state allows individual farms and family farms to be exempt from profit tax, paying only land tax and income tax.

Revitalize the "second youth" of cooperatives

Bulgaria's agricultural cooperatives have a long history. Even before the establishment of the republic, Bulgaria had a number of small agricultural cooperatives. After the founding of the nation, cooperatives developed. However, since the 1970s, due to the vigorous development of agro-industrial complexes and the so-called "transition from collective ownership to public ownership," the enthusiasm of the cooperative economy was suppressed, affecting the development of productive forces.

In response to this situation, Zhivkov proposed to revitalize the "second youth" of cooperatives. Relevant departments have re-formulated the agricultural cooperative law, stipulating that cooperatives should be established in all agricultural activities that are not suitable for work teams to operate, but that families and individuals are also unable to undertake. Various levels of government give policy preferences to various cooperatives, such as issuing low-interest loans and timely supplying seeds, fertilizers, and other materials.

To encourage the production enthusiasm of agricultural workers, Bulgaria is reforming the agricultural product pricing system, implementing the principle of pricing "according to quality, demand, and season." At the same time, it reduces the selling price of agricultural industrial products. Bulgaria is also improving the agricultural insurance system, relaxing restrictions on the export of agricultural products, and allowing agricultural organizations to establish direct contacts with foreign companies and set up foreign exchange funds.

Bulgaria's agricultural reforms are in full swing, but the realization of the reform blueprint still requires time. (Accompanying picture)

    保加利亚积极进行农业改革
    郭春晓
    素以农业国著称的保加利亚从80年代中期起也遇上了农业发展缓慢，甚至倒退的问题。1985年，全国粮食产量只及1984年的一半，市场上农副产品和果菜供应开始紧张。
    农业滑坡有一定客观原因。1985年，该国遭受多年不遇的大旱。以后几年又遇春寒、秋涝、早雪等灾害。但是，就农业的总体发展而言，旧的管理体制、不合理的经济关系以及粗放的经营模式始终是削弱农业发展活力的主要原因。针对这种情况，保共总书记托·日夫科夫同志在去、今年提出新时期发展农业的总构想和一整套改革农业生产体制的措施。
    改组农工综合体，实行公司化
    农工综合体是70年代成立的一种政经合一的农业组织。由于规模庞大，管理方式僵化，效益低下，农民积极性难以发挥。保加利亚从今年起逐步将每个综合体分解成若干个集体农场，并引进工业管理模式，实行农业组织公司化。集体农场中从事农业活动的基本单位是作业队，它们是土地和农业生产资料的直接经营者。作业队实行独立经济核算和自负盈亏；在合同承包的基础上同上下左右发生关系；作业队领导人实行差额选举；打破工资奖金分配制，实行个人收入与最终劳动成果（产品）挂钩的报酬办法。
    广泛实行承包、租赁制
    1986年保共13大后，保农村开始实行承包制。但承包范围小，期限短。现在，保决定把承包制扩展到全国所有的农业部门和活动中去。承包期也从10年延长到50年。承包形式有作业队、小组、家庭和个人承包，多种多样。与此同时，对土地、果园、畜牧场等实行租赁。租金的交纳或以现金，或以实物，或二者兼有。对于承包人和承租人出售农产品的方式，国家不予限制。为防止承包和租赁过程中发生投机行为，政府规定承包人和承租人不得将土地或农业生产资料转让。
    为个体农场和家庭农场“开绿灯”
    保新颁布的土地法正式确认了个人或家庭兴办农场的权利。农场的土地通过与乡政府签订租赁合同获得。拖拉机、播种机和联合收割机等可贷款购买，也可以从集体农场农机站租用。个体农场或家庭农场只要在地区法院登记注册，都可通过劳动合同雇佣10个以下的农业工人。国家允许个体农场和家庭农场免交利润税，只交土地税和所得税。
    恢复合作社的“第二次青春”
    保加利亚的农业合作社具有悠久的历史。早在共和国成立前，保已出现一批小型的农业合作社。建国后，合作社得到发展。但是，从70年代起，由于大力发展农工综合体，搞所谓“集体所有制向全民所有制过渡”，压制了合作经济的积极性，影响了生产力的发展。
    针对这种情况，日夫科夫提出要恢复合作社的“第二次青春”。有关部门重新制定了农业合作社法，规定在一切不适于作业队经营，而家庭和个人也无力承担的农业活动中组建合作社。各级政府对各种合作社给予政策优惠，如发放低息贷款，及时供应种子、化肥等。
    为鼓励农业劳动者的生产积极性，保加利亚正在改革农产品价格体制，实行“按质、按需求、按季节”定价的原则。同时降低农用工业品的售价。保加利亚还完善了农业保险制度，放宽对出口农产品的限制，允许农业组织直接同外国公司建立联系和设立外汇基金。
    保加利亚的农业改革方兴未艾，但改革蓝图的实现尚待时日。（附图片）
