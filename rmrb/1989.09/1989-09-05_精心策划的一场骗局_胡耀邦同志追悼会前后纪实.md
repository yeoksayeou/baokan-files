The turmoil that occurred this spring and summer was triggered prematurely by the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang.

The central government's announcement about holding a memorial service for Comrade Hu Yaobang was only released on the evening of April 19. However, on the 16th, members of the State Economic Reform Institute, who were under the control of Bào Tóng, and the editor of the _Economic Weekly_, Gāo Yù, approached Peking University student Wáng Dān and explicitly told him: "This time we are going to cause a stir along the streets... because the common people in China have all become Hua Xuaixi and Ah Q." "We hope that on Saturday (22nd), all students will gather outside the Great Hall of the People." On the 18th, Lǐ Shūyàn again instructed Wáng Dán: "The demand to participate in the memorial service is something many people have in mind, and this way, the matter will escalate."

Before the 22nd, whether it was submitting a petition to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the 18th or storming Zhongnanhai at dawn on the 20th, these were all preparations made by the instigators and organizers of the turmoil for that day.

Many students participated in some activities with genuine mourning for Comrade Hu Yaobang. However, those who stubbornly persisted in bourgeois liberalization had entirely different intentions from the start; they aimed to instigate a political struggle against the Communist Party's leadership and the socialist system.

On the afternoon of April 15, just a few hours after Comrade Hu's passing, Tsinghua University had already posted slogans like "Li Peng resign." That evening, Peking University appeared with large-character posters: "We demand the removal of the incompetent government, overthrow the autocratic ruler, and establish a democratic political system." On the 16th, Renmin University's slogans proposed: "Mourn Hu, curse Li, and overthrow Deng; say a thousand reasons, a million reasons, but chop off the four." On the 17th, the large-character posters at the China University of Political Science and Law were even more explicit: "The current task is to protect the living reformers, protect Zhao Ziyang." By the 22nd, the number of large-character posters in the capital's universities had reached over a thousand.

The content of these large-character posters was also spreading in Tiananmen Square. The Hong Kong magazine _The 1990s_ published an eyewitness account by a Hong Kong resident, stating that on the evening of April 18, he heard university students speaking in Tiananmen Square. One student said: "China has only one-party dictatorship, which is bureaucracy. Overthrow the Communist Party's one-party dictatorship!" The crowd laughed, some shouted "impractical," some applauded, and others jeered.

Some cultural "elites" were also actively preparing public opinion. On the 15th, the editors of _World Economic Herald_ and _New Observer_ magazine, Gē Yáng and Sū Shàozhì, among others, made contact to prepare for a symposium. At the symposium on the 19th, Yán Jiāqí, Dài Chéng, and others proposed to rehabilitate Comrade Hu Yaobang, thoroughly negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and hinted at "overthrowing Deng and protecting Zhao." The editor-in-chief of _World Economic Herald_, Qīn Běnlì, decided to print the newspaper containing the symposium content in advance and send it to Beijing before the 22nd to "influence the student movement."

On the 21st, Yán Jiāqí, Bāo Zhuānxìn, and others' petition to the Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress opportunely appeared in the campuses of various key universities. The content of the petition was almost identical to the one submitted by Wáng Dān and others on the 18th. Next to the petition, large and small-character posters were already posted, claiming to "clarify the truth of the April 20 bloodshed" and "go to Tiananmen Square to participate in the memorial service."

A frenzied mood was thus ignited among the students. In the afternoon of the 21st, Peking University and Tsinghua University even spread the rumor that "Yaobang was killed by the highest commander's guards," and some students discussed intercepting the hearse. That evening, Beijing Normal University was in chaos, with students from other schools breaking down the gates, and tens of thousands of people coming and going to hold a "mobilization meeting." Wū'ěr Kāixī held a loudspeaker on the playground, inciting everyone to "demand justice for the April 20 bloodshed." Someone brought a large bag of lime on a bicycle into the crowd to distribute, which was stopped by some senior students.

The storm was brewing, and the turmoil seemed like an arrow on a string, ready to be released. Overseas news media could no longer contain their excitement. On the 21st, the _Central Daily News_ in Taiwan printed a large headline: "The mainland is about to erupt in greater turmoil"; the _Oriental Daily News_ in Hong Kong published a prominent headline: "Tomorrow's memorial service for Hu, students may storm the venue." The _Washington Post_ in the United States simply quoted a Beijing university student: "Mourning Hu Yaobang is just an excuse for the protesters."

At around 2:30 AM on the 22nd, tens of thousands of students entered Tiananmen Square and either sat on the ground or lay down to sleep, while others played and chatted on the lawn near the Monument to the People's Heroes. Most of the student representatives sent by various schools were also unsure of what to do after dawn.

At a hastily convened meeting of representatives from more than 20 universities, Gūo Hǎifēng proposed to first organize a peaceful petition. Before the memorial service, they demanded that the Politburo Standing Committee, including Deng Xiaoping, meet for negotiations. If not, they would storm the Great Hall of the People. The student representatives from various schools immediately expressed disagreement. It was too unpopular to cause a disturbance at someone's funeral; moreover, students had no mental preparation for any "negotiations"; everyone had come to attend the memorial service. After such a debate, around 6 AM, the representatives decided to present three demands to the funeral office: absolutely guarantee student safety, view Hu Yaobang's remains, and have the hearse circle the square.

At 7:15 AM, the funeral office informed Xióng Yàn, Xióng Wěi, and five other student representatives: as long as the student procession did not cause disorder, they would guarantee student safety; it was impossible to temporarily arrange for so many people to enter the Great Hall of the People to view the remains; the hearse's route through the square was still under discussion. The students expressed understanding. However, they quickly presented three new demands: clarify the "April 20 incident at Zhongnanhai," increase educational funding, and have the media tell the truth. The funeral office quickly responded: the first point could not be detailed at the moment, the second point was unrelated to today's funeral activities, and the third point had been reported to the relevant departments. After hearing this, the student representatives did not raise any further demands.

However, those who claimed to have "backing," such as Wū'ěr Kāixī, were determined to cause a disturbance. After entering the square, Wū'ěr Kāixī told reporters: "We are here to struggle, and we have the right to choose various forms of struggle. For example, we can shout slogans during the memorial service. If our conditions are not met, we may do this. Secondly, we might make government officials uncomfortable." Wū'ěr Kāixī repeatedly said: "We are not moving now, but we are not going to stay still forever." "If our conditions are not met, we will take action when we return."

In fact, some people started acting as soon as they entered the square. They deliberately created a commotion in front of the Great Hall of the People. At 3:30 AM, when a squad of on-duty guards arrived, these people immediately surrounded, pushed, and cursed them. Slogans like "Down with the tyranny" and "Soldiers, get out" were shouted. To avoid conflict, the squad of guards withdrew. At 4:30 AM, a responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Traffic Management Bureau, dressed in police uniform, came to the east side of the Great Hall of the People to direct traffic and was immediately surrounded, kicked, and beaten.

Before dawn, the student procession had already gathered on the road in front of the Great Hall of the People, and the square was filled with people, making it impossible to clear the area. At 8:00 AM, the guards on duty for the security mission could only prepare to stand guard at the edge of the parking lot in front of the Great Hall of the People. Some students immediately stood up and, in an organized manner, charged towards the guards who had not yet formed a security line. The Hong Kong magazine _Common People_ reporter on the scene wrote: "The Institute of Journalism and Communication's slogan 'The media should tell the truth' surged forward. Rumors spread, and the background was the sound of cheering, people's spirits were about to go crazy."

To avoid conflict, the guards stood outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People, with the student procession only a few meters away. The few people who hoped for and almost witnessed a bloody incident were controlled.

During the memorial service, the square broadcasted the live situation. After playing the funeral music and viewing the remains, many students and civilians in the square ran northward to see the hearse. The university students who had been out for more than ten hours mostly felt that it was time to end, and some students were already preparing to leave.

The students in the square did not know that a few people, after failing to disrupt the memorial service, had a second plan. On the 21st, Wáng Dān, Gūo Hǎifēng, Fēng Cóngdé, Xióng Yàn, and other core members of the "Peking University United Students Preparatory Committee" secretly held a meeting and decided that Fēng Cóngdé would re-copy the petition submitted on the 18th, "utilizing this opportunity where many students are present to petition after the memorial service."

This conspiracy, known only to a few people, was suddenly made public only after the car convoy of Premier Li Peng and other leaders had left the west gate of the Great Hall of the People. Around 10:50 AM, the west side of the square suddenly echoed with shouts of "Dialogue! Dialogue!" followed by shouts of "Li Peng come out," "Li Peng dialogue," and so on. Wū'ěr Kāixī and Gūo Hǎifēng stood in front of the student procession closest to the Great Hall of the People.

As the shouting grew louder, Fēng Cóngdé passed a large roll of paper from the Peking University contingent to Gūo Hǎifēng, indicating to him: "Give it to Li Peng." At around 11:20 AM, Gūo Hǎifēng held up the petition with both hands, signaling to the crowd, and Wū'ěr Kāixī, holding a loudspeaker, shouted beside him, along with two other university students, walked towards the Great Hall of the People.

At the foot of the Great Hall of the People's steps, Gūo Hǎifēng told the funeral office staff who rushed over: "We want to hand over the petition." Wū'ěr Kāixī added: "We want to hand it to Li Peng, and we must hand it over in person." The funeral office staff suggested that they send a representative into the Great Hall of the People, but Wū'ěr Kāixī refused to agree, insisting: "Li Peng coming out is our first demand, and we will abandon all other demands." He issued an ultimatum: "12:45 is the final deadline."

At 12:00 PM, a responsible person hurried out of the Great Hall of the People and asked the funeral office staff: "Can the students clear the path, so the hearse can circle the square?" The funeral office staff repeatedly persuaded Wū'ěr Kāixī and the other three: "Since you are here to attend the memorial service, you should first send off Comrade Hu's spirit." But they insisted: "Let Li Peng come out."

At this time, Tiananmen Square and the surrounding roads were already crowded with people, and the student procession was still surging towards the Great Hall of the People. Comrade Zhao Ziyang had climbed to the top of the Great Hall of the People, used binoculars to observe the situation, but gave no instructions and left in his car to play golf.

The staff of the funeral office and the Great Hall of the People who had contact with Wū'ěr Kāixī and Gūo Hǎifēng had never mentioned that Comrade Li Peng would come to the square, but Wū'ěr Kāixī used a loudspeaker to announce to the students in the square: "(The Great Hall of the People) has sent word that Li Peng will come out to meet us at 12:00 for a dialogue, please be patient and wait." This enormous lie quickly spread throughout the square. Some surprised university students discussed: "Should we applaud if Li Peng comes?" Some were puzzled: "Why does Li Peng have to come out? Except for increasing educational funding, the contents of the petition are not under the jurisdiction of the State Council." Some still did not understand: "The petition has already been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Is it appropriate to make demands and petition during a funeral?"

At 12:45 PM, Wū'ěr Kāixī suddenly rushed up the steps of the Great Hall of the People, holding a loudspeaker and shouting loudly: "I protest!" Gūo Hǎifēng and the other three also walked up the steps and suddenly knelt down. Gūo Hǎifēng held up the petition high and cried out loudly, crying and shouting: "Li Peng, why don't you come out!" Wū'ěr Kāixī incited: "Li Peng deceived us!"

Although some clear-headed university students and graduate students felt that it was absurd to require Li Peng to come out when he could not, to accept a petition that was not within his jurisdiction and had already been submitted, and to disapprove of the manner of kneeling, they could no longer express their doubts. The entire square was filled with cries, and the enraged university students rushed towards the Great Hall of the People. A female student shouted, "Kill me," and rushed towards the police.

After kneeling for about ten minutes, Gūo Hǎifēng and the others sat down, and the students' opposition had reached its peak. Wū'ěr Kāixī, who had returned to the square, immediately held a small meeting with representatives from some schools. By around 2:00 PM, the student procession began to withdraw from the square and marched towards Zhongnanhai, shouting unified slogans: "Peaceful petition, the government does not listen. Broadcast nationwide, unified strike."

On the 22nd, some strange things also happened. In the afternoon, after the university students who participated in the memorial service returned to school, leaflets from Beijing Normal University were distributed to them. The leaflets stated: "At 12:30, the representatives of Beijing Normal University told the students that Li Peng would meet the students at 12:45. At 2:00 PM, Li Peng had not come out. The students angrily surged forward, and the armed police rushed up and beat the students with belts and other objects..."

On the morning of the 22nd, at 11:00 AM, Yán Jiāqí, Sū Xiǎokāng, and others' petition, "demanding government dialogue" and "absolutely not allowing violence against students," was posted on the walls of Beijing Normal University and other universities.

Fāng Lìzhī gave a talk to foreign journalists on the same day, proudly stating: "If the Communist Party does not have an honest dialogue with the students, then the situation will not be optimistic." Wáng Dān also happily told foreign journalists: "I believe that the action has had a certain influence."

On the same day, members of the reactionary organization "Chinese Alliance" from Taiwan, including Hú Píng, Chén Jūn, and Liú Xiāobō, sent an open letter from New York, USA, calling for "consolidating the organizational connections established during this activity."

The _New Observer_ magazine blatantly distorted the facts, first spreading rumors about the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau imposing martial law, then praising the students for occupying Tiananmen Square, making "the main venue of the memorial service outside the Great Hall of the People. At noon, three university students knelt down on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, demanding to personally hand over the petition to the national leaders. The national leaders are busy with work and do not have time to meet tens of thousands of university student representatives." They also incited: "They knelt down, nailing bureaucratism to the pillar of historical shame."

Under such a political atmosphere, 60,000 university students in Beijing went on strike. Some people began to travel south and north, east and west, linking up and fundraising. Many university students from other places followed suit.

On the same day, serious incidents of beating, smashing, and looting occurred in Xi'an and Changsha.

Wáng Dān had said as early as April 16th that the "focus of the large-character posters had begun to shift," "if it develops, it may be linked with the May Fourth Movement." "Many people have high hopes for my guidance." From April 16th to April 22nd, he and his accomplices, along with a few people behind the scenes, worked tirelessly, and on April 22nd, they meticulously planned this big hoax, aiming to further "guide" more students who were unaware of the truth into the turmoil.

    精心策划的一场骗局
    ——胡耀邦同志追悼会前后纪实
    任玉清
    今年春夏之交发生的这场动乱，是借胡耀邦同志逝世而提前爆发的。
    中央关于召开胡耀邦同志追悼会的公告是4月19日晚才公布的。然而在16日，受控于鲍彤的国家体改所成员、《经济学周报》编辑高瑜便找到北大学生王丹，明确地告诉他：“这次咱们要掀起十里长街……因为中国的老百姓都成了华老栓了，成了阿Q了。”“星期六（22日）我们希望学生都到人民大会堂外。”18日，李淑娴又向王丹授意：“要求参加追悼会，很多人都有这个心理，这样事情就闹大了。”
    在22日之前，无论是18日向人大常委会递交请愿书，还是20日凌晨冲击新华门，都是动乱的策划者和组织者们为这一天所作的准备。
    一
    许多大学生是怀着对胡耀邦同志的悼念之情来参加一些活动的，但是，那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人完全不是这样，他们从一开始就要掀起一场反对共产党领导和社会主义制度的政治斗争。
    4月15日下午，耀邦同志去世才几个小时，清华大学就贴出了“李鹏辞职”的标语。晚上，北京大学出现了大字报：“我们要求撤换无能政府，推翻专制君主，建立民主政治。”16日，中国人民大学的标语提出：“悼胡公骂李公不如倒了邓公；说千条道万条不如砍掉四条。”17日，中国政法大学的大字报更加明确地说：“现在的任务是要保护活着的改革派，保护赵紫阳。”至22日前，首都高校的大字报已有上千份。
    这些大字报的内容也在天安门广场上散播着。香港《九十年代》月刊登出一位港人的目击日记说，4月18日晚，他在天安门广场听大学生们演讲，一学生说：“中国只有一党专制，就是官僚。打倒共产党一党专制！”众人大笑，有喊“不现实的”，有鼓掌的，还有起哄的。
    一些文化“精英”们也积极地做着舆论准备。15日，《世界经济导报》与《新观察》杂志主编戈扬以及苏绍智等人联系，准备召开座谈会。在19日的座谈会上，严家其、戴晴等人提出要为胡耀邦同志平反、彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化，并暗示要“倒邓保赵”。《世界经济导报》总编辑钦本立决定，将刊有这个座谈会内容的报纸提前印刷，赶在22日之前发往北京，以“影响学运”。
    21日这天，严家其、包遵信等人给中央、人大常委会的请愿书不失时机地出现在各重点大学的校园，其内容与王丹等人18日所呈请愿书如出一辙。在请愿书的旁边，已贴上了所谓“澄清4·20血案真相”的大小字报及“到天安门去参加追悼会”的通知。
    一股狂躁的情绪就这样在大学生中点燃起来了。21日下午，北大清华甚至传出了“耀邦是被最高统帅警卫打死的”谣言，有的学生竟商议要“截灵车”。晚上，北师大则一片混乱，外校学生撞开了校门，上万人出出进进要开什么“誓师会”。吾尔开希拿着电喇叭在操场上煽动大家“讨还4·20血债”。还有人用自行车驮着一大袋白灰进到人群中分发，被一些高年级学生制止了。
    山雨未来风满楼。借胡耀邦同志的追悼会大闹一场的风波似弦上之箭，一触即发。海外的一些新闻媒介也已按捺不住地发出了信息。21日这天，台湾《中央日报》印出了大标题：“大陆势将爆发更大动乱”；香港《东方日报》刊出醒目标题：“明天悼胡纪念会，学生可能冲会场。”美国《华盛顿邮报》则干脆引用北京某大学生的话：“悼念胡耀邦只是示威者的借口”。
    二
    22日凌晨，数万大学生进入天安门广场后便席地而坐或倒头大睡，还有的在纪念碑附近的草坪上嬉戏谈笑着。大多数学校推出的学生代表也都不清楚天亮之后干什么好。
    午夜两点多钟，在临时召开的20多所高校代表会议上，郭海峰提出，首先要搞和平请愿。在追悼会前，要求政治局常委甚至邓小平接见，进行谈判。如果不行，就冲入大会堂。各校学生代表一听，马上都表示不同意。在人家办丧事时去闯灵堂闹事，太不得人心；再说，学生们谁也没有思想准备搞什么“谈判”，大家是来开追悼会的。经过这样一番争议，大约6时左右，代表们才决定向治丧办提出3条要求：绝对保证学生安全，瞻仰胡耀邦遗容，灵车绕广场一周。
    7时15分，治丧办的同志转告熊焱、熊炜等5名学生代表：只要学生队伍不乱，将保证学生安全；临时安排那么多人进大会堂瞻仰遗容不可能；灵车能否从广场过正在商议中。对此，熊炜等人表示理解。但他们很快又提出3条新要求：澄清“新华门血案”，增加教育经费，新闻要说真话。治丧办的同志又很快答复他们：第一条现在无法答复详细情节，第二条与今天治丧活动无关，第三条已向有关部门反映。几名学生代表听后便不再提什么。
    但是，自称“有后台”的吾尔开希等人却打定主意要大闹一场。吾尔开希进广场后对记者说：“我们是来斗争的，有权选择多种多样的斗争方式。如在开追悼会的时候高喊口号。如果不答应我们的条件，我们就有可能这么做。其次，我们也许会使政府官员难堪。”吾尔开希一再说：“我们现在不动，但不是永远不动。”“如果条件不被落实，我们回去就要行动。”
    实际上，一些人一进广场就行动起来了。他们有意识地在大会堂前的马路上鼓噪着。凌晨3时30分，当一队执勤的警卫来到这里时，这些人立即上前围挤、推搡、谩骂。“打倒暴政”、“当兵的滚蛋”等口号也响了起来。为了不发生冲突，这队警卫战士撤了回去。4时30分，身着警服的北京市公安交通管理局的一位负责同志来到人大会堂东侧路，准备疏导交通时，马上又被围攻踢打。
    天亮前，大学生的队伍已拥到人大会堂前的马路上，广场上聚满了人，根本无法清场。8时整，执行警戒任务的警卫人员只能准备在大会堂前的停车场边站岗警戒。一些学生即刻站起来，有组织地一排排地向尚未列出警戒线的警卫们冲击。在现场的香港《百姓》月刊记者写道：“社科院新闻系标语‘新闻要说真话’往前涌进。传闻风起，背景是嗬嗬的叫声，人们的精神快要疯了。”
    为了避免冲突，警卫战士们克制地站在了大会堂东门外，学生们的队伍离他们只有数米远。极少数人期望的、眼看就要发生的流血事件被控制住了。
    追悼会期间，广场播放现场实况。放哀乐瞻仰遗容后，广场上的许多学生和群众便向北跑去，准备看灵车。已经出来了十几个小时的大学生们大都觉得该结束了，部分学生已经准备要走了。
    三
    广场上的大学生们并不知道，极少数人在搅乱追悼会不成后，还有着第二手计划。在21日这天，王丹、郭海峰、封从德、熊焱等“北大团结学生筹委会”的核心成员秘密召开了会议，决定由封从德把18日已递交过的请愿书重抄一遍，“利用这个许多学生都在场的机会，在追悼会后进行请愿。”
    这个一直只有几个人知道的阴谋是在李鹏总理等领导同志的车队已离开大会堂的西门后才突然公开的。大约10时50分，广场西部猛然响起了“对话！对话！”的叫声，继而又喊起了：“李鹏出来”、“李鹏对话”等口号。吾尔开希、郭海峰等人则站到了离大会堂最近的学生队伍前面。
    随着喊声越来越大，封从德从北大队伍里将一大卷纸传给郭海峰，示意他：“交给李鹏”。11点20分左右，郭海峰双手举起请愿书，向人群示意，吾尔开希拿着电喇叭在他身边喊叫着与另外两名大学生一起向人大会堂走去。
    在大会堂台阶下，郭海峰对闻讯赶来的治丧办的同志说：
  “我们要交请愿书。”吾尔开希接着说：“我们要交给李鹏，非面交不可。”治丧办的同志提出让他们派代表进入大会堂，吾尔开希拒不同意，他坚持道：“李鹏出来是第一要求，除此之外，放弃一切要求。”并下了通牒：“12点45分是最后期限。”
    12点整，一位负责同志匆匆从大会堂出来，问治丧办的同志：“能不能让学生让开通道，灵车绕广场一周？”治丧办的同志又反复劝说吾尔开希等4人：“你们既然是来开追悼会的，就应先送耀邦英灵。”但他们就是一句话：“让李鹏出来。”
    此时的天安门广场和周围的道路上已挤满了人，学生队伍还在不断往大会堂涌。赵紫阳同志曾登上大会堂顶，用望远镜看了看这一情景，但没做任何指示，便驱车离去，准备打高尔夫球去了。
    与吾尔开希、郭海峰等人接触的治丧办和人大会堂的工作人员谁也没说过李鹏同志要来广场，但吾尔开希却用电喇叭向广场的学生们宣布：“（人民大会堂）里边传出话来，李鹏12点出来与我们见面对话，请大家耐心等待。”这个弥天大谎迅速传遍广场，有些感到意外的大学生们议论起来：“李鹏来了我们鼓不鼓掌？”有的挺纳闷：“为什么要李鹏出来？除了增加教育经费外，请愿的内容都不归国务院管呀。”有的还不明白：“请愿书不是已经递给人大常委会了吗？办丧事时提条件搞请愿，合适吗？”
    12时45分，吾尔开希一下子冲上大会堂台阶，举着电喇叭高声叫道：“我抗议！”郭海峰等三人也走上台阶，忽然跪了下来。郭海峰高高举着请愿书，放声大哭，边哭边喊：“李鹏，你为什么不出来！”吾尔开希则鼓动道：李鹏欺骗了我们！
    尽管有些头脑清醒的大学生、研究生已感到事先无任何招呼，即要求李鹏在不能出来的时候，不可能交谈对话的地点，接受本不属于他职责范畴，并已经递交过的请愿书是很荒谬的，更不赞成其下跪的方式，但是，他们已无法表达自己的疑问了。整个广场哭声一片，群情激愤的大学生向大会堂冲过来。一个女学生喊着“打死我吧”，拚命向警察撞去。
    郭海峰等人跪了十几分钟后方坐了下来，学生们的对立情绪已达到顶点。回到广场的吾尔开希即和一些学校的代表开了个小会，不到两点，学生队伍开始撤离广场，向新华门方向游行，并喊出了统一的口号：“和平请愿，政府不理。通电全国，统一罢课。”
    四
    22日这天，令人奇怪的事还发生了一些。下午，参加追悼会的大学生刚刚回校，北师大的传单就撒到了他们手中。传单写道：“12∶30，师大的代表告诉同学，李鹏将于12∶45接见学生。下午2∶00，李鹏还未出来。同学们愤怒地向前涌去，武警冲上去用皮带等殴打学生……”
    这天上午11时，严家其、苏晓康等人“要求政府对话”、“绝不许对学生施暴”的请愿书贴在了北师大等高校的墙上。
    方励之在当天对外国记者发表了谈话，他得意地说道：“中共若不与学生坦诚对话，那么形势发展就不乐观。”王丹也高兴地告诉外国记者：“相信行动已发挥了一定的影响。”
    这一天，由台湾反动组织“中国民联”成员胡平、陈军、刘晓波等联名从美国纽约发出了《致中国大学生公开信》，要求“巩固在这次活动中建立起来的组织联系”。
    《新观察》杂志则明目张胆地歪曲事实，先是造谣北京市公安局“戒严”，然后称赞学生强占天安门广场，使“追悼会的主会场在大会堂外。中午，3名大学生‘扑通’跪倒在大会堂台阶上，要求向国家领导人面交请愿书。国家领导人工作繁忙，没有时间接见十数万大学生代表。”并煽动道：“他们往地下一跪，就把官僚主义钉在了历史的耻辱柱上。”
    在这样一个政治气氛下，北京6万大学生罢课了。一些人开始南下北上，东来西走，串联募捐。外地许多大学生也相继效仿。
    同一天，西安和长沙发生了严重的打、砸、抢事件。
    王丹早在4月16日就说，大字报的“锋芒所指开始转向”，
  “如果发展下去，有可能与‘五四’相联。”“不少人寄希望于我引导方向。”从4月16日至4月22日这一个星期，他和他的同伙以及背后的极少数人紧锣密鼓，到4月22日这一天又精心策划了这样一个大骗局，目的就在于把更多不明真相的大学生进一步“引导”向动乱的泥潭。
