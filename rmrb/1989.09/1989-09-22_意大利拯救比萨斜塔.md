Xinhua News Agency, Rome, September 20th.

One of Europe's most famous cultural landmarks, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is tilting more and more each year. The Italian government has recently decided that the work to reinforce the tower can no longer be delayed and has tasked the relevant departments with quickly formulating a rescue plan and implementing it.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa's rate of tilt has not accelerated in recent years, with the tower tilting at a rate of one millimeter per year. However, if this continues, it may reach a point of collapse. The Italian government advocates for improving the tower's monitoring system on one hand, and on the other, it demands that experts from major European universities quickly propose reinforcement plans.

The problem with the Leaning Tower of Pisa lies in its damp and soft foundation. Most technical experts believe that the most unstable part of the foundation should be reinforced, but a feasible plan to implement this idea has not yet been proposed.

    意大利拯救比萨斜塔
    新华社罗马9月20日电　欧洲最著名的文化古迹之一——比萨斜塔的倾斜度正在逐步增加。意大利政府最近认为加固斜塔的工作不能再拖了，并已责成有关部门尽快制定拯救方案并付诸实施。
    比萨斜塔的倾斜速度近年来并未加快，每年倾斜一毫米，但长此下去，就可能达到倒塌的危险点。意大利政府主张：一方面要完善斜塔监测系统，另一方面要求来自欧洲主要学府的专家尽快提出加固方案。
    比萨斜塔的问题出在潮湿而松软的地基上，大多数技术专家认为应对地基中最不稳定的部分进行加固，但落实这一设想的可行方案至今尚未提出。
