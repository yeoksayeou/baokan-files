    Paying Attention to Public Opinion and Seriously Cracking Down on Pornography
    —Starting from the Management of the Audio-Visual Publishing Industry
    Zhong Chengxiang

    Comrade Li Ruihuan recently pointed out in a nationwide telephone conference on the rectification and cleanup of book and audio-visual markets: "Cracking down on pornography" is a major issue that the broad masses of the people are deeply concerned about and firmly demand to be resolved. The proliferation of pornographic books and audio-visual products is both a result of the spread of bourgeois liberalization and a factor that further fuels its spread. Party committees and people's governments at all levels, with the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, must pay attention to public opinion, follow the will of the people, fully recognize the harm of pornographic books and audio-visual products, and the necessity of cracking down on them, and resolutely and uncompromisingly take this matter seriously. As a cultural field with a wide impact, the audio-visual product market has, for a period of time, been flooded with a considerable number of various obscene, pornographic, and violent, murderous, and superstitious content products, seriously poisoning the minds of listeners and viewers, especially young people, and playing a role in undermining social stability and damaging the reputation of reform and opening up. It can truly be said to have reached the point of rampant disaster. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to resolutely and thoroughly rectify and manage the audio-visual publishing industry and market.

    According to statistics, the number of audio-visual publishing units formally approved by the state authorities nationwide has exceeded 160. It should be said that with the improvement of the material and spiritual life of the Chinese people, modern cultural dissemination tools such as tape recorders and VCRs have increasingly entered ordinary households. This naturally gives rise to the issue of the demand for program sources. In such a large country with a population of 1.1 billion, it is completely necessary for the state to approve and plan the establishment of a certain number of audio-visual publishers to produce high-quality audio-visual products to meet the people's demand for a rich and colorful cultural life. However, given the current national conditions and national strength, as well as the quality of the publishing and editing team, it is worth considering whether it is appropriate to develop more than 160 audio-visual publishing units at once. Because in this way, the state will find it difficult to guarantee the necessary cultural investment in the emerging audio-visual publishing industry, and it will also be difficult to guarantee the quality of the large audio-visual publishing and editing team that has suddenly emerged, and the ideological and artistic quality of the spiritual products—audio-visual products—will inevitably be unsatisfactory. The fact is exactly this. Most audio-visual publishing units are hastily set up in the absence of necessary cultural investment, although they have indeed produced a number of good and relatively good audio-visual products, but a considerable number of products still, to varying degrees, go against the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the improvement of people's cultural quality. People have already pointed out sharply that some audio cassettes with dark content, depressed moods, and low taste, either moan without cause or are hysterical, have already been eroding the minds of young people and dispersing people's revolutionary will. As for the more than 900 kinds of video cassettes published domestically, about two-thirds are domestic copyrights, and about one-third are overseas copyrights; but the number of cassettes issued is just the opposite, with domestic copyrights accounting for only one-third, while overseas copyrights account for two-thirds. More notably, the more than 50,000 business video playback points scattered throughout the country, nearly 10,000 units with closed-circuit television systems in institutions, factories, hotels, and about 4 million household VCRs, the video cassettes they play are mostly imported overseas products. These imported overseas video cassettes, although only about 300 kinds, have a circulation of more than 200,000 cassettes. Whether imported or domestically produced video cassettes, the content is mostly of the categories of romance, martial arts, detective, dance, and police and thieves. Added to this are the overseas pornographic video cassettes that have entered the country through smuggling due to lax management, and the domestic illegal duplication and publication of similar inferior products, which are either secretly circulated or sold on the black market. Their circulation is not less than the officially published quantity, and their harm to the audience and disruption of the audio-visual market are not to be underestimated. Therefore, in order to be conducive to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the healthy growth of young people, the management of audio-visual publishing to the audio-visual market urgently needs to be seriously rectified and managed.

    The rectification and management of audio-visual publishing and the audio-visual market require clarifying some erroneous understandings of this work. First, some people think: "Listening to a tape, watching a video, it's just for entertainment, why take it so seriously?" Of course, in the past, it was thought that a song, a novel, or a movie could "ruin the party and the country," which is an exaggerated view of the social role of literature and art; but the influence and role of tapes and videos as modern dissemination media on people's spirits cannot be ignored. Their wide coverage, strong penetration, and deep influence are things that other dissemination media cannot replace. A cassette of "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" and a cassette of "Prison Song" have completely different spiritual guidance. A video of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and an illegally duplicated low-quality video of "Pan Jinlian" have absolutely different aesthetic effects. Therefore, it is crucial to realistically evaluate the position and role of audio-visual products in the overall construction of socialist spiritual civilization and to rectify and manage audio-visual publishing and the audio-visual market from the perspective of improving people's spiritual quality in the long term. Second, some people think: the main audience of audio-visual products is the vast number of young people and the "floating population" scattered throughout cities and countryside, and their appreciation habits and aesthetic tastes are not high, so audio-visual products should mainly cater to them, and it is not realistic to demand high standards for audio-visual products. This view is seemingly correct but actually wrong. Here, there is a serious issue of how to correctly understand and handle the relationship between the adaptation and improvement of spiritual products. Our audio-visual products, of course, should cater to the needs of the vast audience, and if they do not cater at all, they will lose their service objects and thus lose their value; but they should not stop at catering, nor should they regard catering as the goal. Catering is just a means, and improving the aesthetic tastes and spiritual quality of the vast audience is the goal. That is to say, catering is for conquest, for improvement. Since we admit that in the long-term cultural appreciation activities, there are indeed negative factors in the public's aesthetic habits and tastes that go against socialist modernization, we must maintain a clear and sufficient understanding of this.

    The rectification and management of audio-visual publishing and the audio-visual market must also take practical and effective measures. First, strictly control the editing and publishing of audio-visual products. Attention should be paid to improving the ideological and professional quality of the editing team, correctly handling the relationship between social benefits and economic benefits, and insisting on putting social benefits first. Special attention should be paid to quality control in the "collaborative" publishing of audio-visual products. Second, resolutely rectify the audio-visual market and thoroughly "crack down on pornography." At the same time, considering that the main source of programs for household VCRs is rentals, it is necessary to rectify and strengthen the management of business video cassette rental points in cities and countryside. Third, strengthen the management of business video playback points and units with closed-circuit television systems scattered throughout cities and countryside, and insist on the principle that the content of the programs played should be healthy and beneficial to enriching the cultural life of the people, and resolutely stop the playback of reactionary and pornographic video cassettes. Fourth, mobilize the whole society, especially the theoretical criticism community, to pay attention to the publication and distribution of audio-visual products, and through awards and introductions, guide the healthy development of the audio-visual publishing industry, and timely recommend excellent works to the people, so that excellent audio-visual products can produce good social benefits.

    体察民意　认真“扫黄”
    ——从治理音像出版事业谈起
    仲呈祥
    李瑞环同志最近在全国整顿清理书刊及音像市场电话会议上指出：“扫黄”是广大群众普遍关心、坚决要求办好的一件大事。淫秽书刊和音像制品的泛滥，既是资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的结果，又为资产阶级自由化的泛滥起了推波助澜的作用。以全心全意为人民服务为宗旨的各级党委和人民政府，务必体察民意，顺乎民心，充分认识黄色书刊、音像制品的危害性和
  “扫黄”的必要性，态度坚决、毫不手软地把这件事情抓好。作为文化领域里波及面甚广的音像制品市场，一段时期以来，充斥着为数不少的各种淫秽、色情的和宣扬暴力凶杀、封建迷信等内容的劣品，严重地毒害听众和观众、尤其是青少年的心灵，起了破坏社会安定、损害改革和对外开放的声誉的坏作用，真可以说达到了泛滥成灾的地步。因此，坚决、彻底地整顿和治理音像出版事业和市场，确实是势在必行了。
    据统计，目前经国家主管部门正式批准成立的音像出版单位，全国已逾160家。应当说，伴随着我国人民群众物质生活和精神生活水平的提高，作为现代化的文化传播工具的录音机和录像机，已越来越多地进入寻常百姓家。这就自然产生了一个节目源的需求量问题。偌大一个人口达11亿的国度，由国家批准有计划地创建一定数量的音像出版社，生产高质量的音像制品，以满足人民群众丰富多彩的文化生活的需要，是完全必要的。但根据我国目前的国情和国力，以及出版编辑队伍的素质，是否宜于一下子发展到160余家音像出版单位，却是一个值得研究和深思的问题。因为这样一来，国家既难于保证对新兴的音像出版事业的必要的文化投资，也难于保证一窝蜂兴起的庞大的音像出版编辑队伍的素质，而由此产生的精神产品——音像制品的思想艺术质量势必就难如人意。事实正是如此。多数音像出版单位都是在缺乏必要的文化投资的情况下仓促上马的，尽管他们确实也生产了一批好的和比较好的音像制品，但为数不少的产品却程度不同地有悖于建设社会主义精神文明和提高人的文化素质。人们已经尖锐指出，一些内容灰暗、情绪消沉、格调低下的录音歌曲盒带，或无病呻吟，或歇斯底里，已经在侵蚀青少年的心灵、涣散人们的革命意志。至于国内出版的900余种录像盒带中，国产版权的约占2／3，海外版权的约占1／3；但发行盒数正好相反，即国产版权的仅占1／3，而海外版权的却占了2／3。更值得注意的是，遍布全国城乡的5万多个营业性的录像放映点，近万个办有闭路电视系统的机关、厂矿、宾馆，以及400万部左右的进入家庭的私用录像机所播放的录像盒带，大都是进口出版的海外产品。这种进口出版的海外录像盒带虽然只有300余种，但发行量却超过了20万盒。无论是进口的还是国产的录像盒带，内容上绝大多数都属情杀、武打、侦破、歌舞、警匪之类。加上还有由于管理不严靠走私流入的海外色情录像盒带和国内非法翻制、出版的同类劣品，或暗中流传，或黑市倒卖，其流通盒数并不亚于正式出版量，其对观众的危害和对音像市场的骚扰，都是不可小视的。因此，为了有利于社会主义精神文明的建设和青少年的健康成长，从音像出版到音像市场管理，都亟待认真的整顿和治理。
    整顿和治理音像出版和音像市场，需要澄清对这一工作的一些错误认识。首先，有人认为：“听听录音，看看录像，消遣娱乐而已，何必看得那么重？”当然，过去以为一首歌曲、一篇小说、一部电影就可以“亡党亡国”，片面夸大文艺的社会作用，那是不实的；但录音、录像作为现代化的传播媒介，对人们的精神影响和作用却不可忽视，他们的覆盖面之广、渗透性之强、影响力之深，都是别的传播媒介难以替代的。一盒《没有共产党就没有新中国》的歌曲录音带，与一盒《囚歌》的音乐磁带，其对人们精神导向的迥异，确是显而易见的。一盘《红楼梦》录像带，与一盒非法翻制的格调低下的《潘金莲》，其审美效应绝对不可同日而语。所以，实事求是地估价音像制品在整个社会主义精神文明建设中的地位和作用，从着意于提高人的精神素质的久远大计去整顿、治理音像出版和音像市场，是关键的一环。其次，还有人认为：音像制品的主要听众层、观众层是广大青少年和遍及城乡的“盲流”人员，而他们的欣赏习惯和审美趣味都不高，因此音像制品主要任务是适应他们，用高标准去要求音像制品是不切实际的。这种看法似是而非。这里有一个如何正确认识和处理精神产品的适应与提高的关系的严肃课题。我们的音像制品，当然要适应广大听众、观众的要求，完全不适应也就失去了服务对象，也就失去了存在的价值；但决不能止于适应，更不能把适应当成目的，适应只是手段，提高广大听众、观众的审美情趣和精神素质，才是目的。即是说，适应是为了征服、为了提高，才去适应。既然我们承认在长期的文化鉴赏活动中逐渐形成的大众审美习惯和趣味中，确实还存在着有悖于社会主义现代化的消极因素，对此我们必须保持清醒的、足够的认识。
    整顿和治理音像出版和音像市场，还必须采取切实有力的相应措施。其一，严格把好音像制品的编辑、出版关。应注意提高编辑队伍的思想、业务素质，正确处理好社会效益与经济效益的关系，坚持把社会效益放在第一位。对于音像出版中的“协作”出版尤应注重质量把关。其二，要坚决整顿音像市场，彻底“扫黄”。同时，鉴于进入家庭的私用录像机主要的节目源是靠租借，因此，对城乡的营业性的录像盒带租借点必须进行整顿，加强管理。其三，要加强对遍布城乡的营业性录像放映点和办有闭路电视系统的单位的管理，对于播放节目要坚持思想内容健康、有益于丰富人民群众文化生活的原则，坚决制止播放反动、淫秽的录像盒带。其四，要发动全社会特别是理论批评界关注音像制品的出版和发行，应通过评奖、评介等方式引导音像出版事业健康发展，并及时地向人民群众推荐佳作，促使优秀的音像制品产生良好的社会效益。
