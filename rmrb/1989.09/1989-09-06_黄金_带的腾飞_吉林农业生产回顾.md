Jilin's significant contribution to the nation is grain production. Grain is the pride of the people of Jilin.

Nature has endowed Jilin with excellent conditions: 60 million mu of fertile farmland suitable for the cultivation of various crops. Today, the vast Songliao Plain is praised as China's "Corn Belt" – the "Golden Belt." However, in the early years after the founding of the People's Republic, the province's total grain and soybean production was only 4.5 billion kilograms, with an average yield of just 73 kilograms per mu. The farmers of Jilin, through hard work and diligent cultivation, made significant progress, but there were also years of stagnation. The wish to surpass the 10 billion kilogram mark for total grain production was repeatedly dashed. The real leap in grain production came only in the past decade.

The pragmatic line established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee brought a true spring to Jilin's rural areas. The establishment of new production relations provided a broad scope for the development of productive forces. In 1979, 859 production brigades in Changling County pioneered the implementation of the responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, achieving an average increase of 15% in production and a 26% increase in per capita income that year. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee promptly summarized the experience and promoted it widely. By the end of 1983, 97.6% of the production brigades in the province had implemented the household contract responsibility system.

This marked a major turning point in agricultural production, bringing about changes that previous generations of farmers could hardly have imagined: In 1982, the province's grain production surpassed the 10 billion kilogram mark for the first time; in 1984, it exceeded 15 billion kilograms; and in 1988, it set a new record of 169.3 billion kilograms, with rural per capita income soaring to 627.5 yuan!

Thanks to policies, technology, and investment, Jilin's grain production rose from the 15th position nationwide to the 9th; per capita grain availability increased to 722 kilograms, double the national average, ranking first in the country; since 1983, the volume of grain exports and per capita commercial grain deliveries have been at the top for six consecutive years; the grain commercialization rate has been above 50% every year. Since 1983, the province has cumulatively exported 105.1 million tons of grain, with corn exports ranking first in the country and enjoying a high reputation in the international market.

The progress in grain production has led to a comprehensive development of Jilin's agriculture. Livestock farming has benefited the most. Over the past decade, meat production has increased by 1.62 times, dairy production by 2.82 times, and egg production by 2.73 times. People's dietary structure has undergone significant changes. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee and Government have designated 1989 as the "Year of Livestock," aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in meat within three years, and then strive to convert grain into livestock products, making Jilin a province that exports livestock products.

The farmland protection forests, which directly serve grain production, have added new greenery to Jilin's forests. The region known as the "Eight-Hundred-Li Desert" in Baicheng has not only initially controlled the sandstorms but also formed a network of forests around the farmland, with significant economic benefits. From 1980 to 1988, the proportion of protection forests in the province increased from 27% to 31.8%, and economic forests from 2% to 11%.

With the development of grain deep processing, township enterprises based on local resources have also made rapid progress. In 1988, the total output value of township enterprises in the province surpassed the 10 billion yuan mark. After adjustments and improvements this year, the total output value is expected to reach 13 billion yuan.

    “黄金”带的腾飞
    ——吉林农业生产回顾
    江鸥
    吉林对国家贡献较大的是粮食。粮食是吉林人的骄傲。
    大自然赐予吉林的条件是优越的，6000万亩肥沃良田，适宜多种农作物生产，如今，广阔的松辽平原被人们称誉为中国的“玉米带”——“黄金带”。然而，建国初期，全省粮豆总产量不过45亿公斤，平均亩产仅73公斤。吉林的农民，艰苦奋斗、辛勤耕耘，虽然取得不小进步，却有过多年徘徊的局面，粮食总产量跨100亿公斤大关的愿望，一次又一次地落空了。粮食生产的真正腾飞，还是近十年的事。
    党的十一届三中全会确定的实事求是的思想路线，给吉林农村带来真正的春天。新的生产关系的建立，使生产力发展有了广阔的天地。1979年，长岭县859个生产队率先实行了包干到组责任制，当年平均增产15％，人均收入增长26％。吉林省委及时总结经验，推而广之。到1983年末，全省97.6％的生产队实行了家庭联产承包责任制。
    这是农业生产的大转折，它所带来的变化是世世代代农民所不敢想象的：1982年，全省粮食生产首次突破100亿公斤大关；1984年，又突破150亿公斤；1988年，再创169.3亿公斤的新纪录，农村人均收入猛增到627.5元！
    靠着政策、科技、投入，使吉林粮食生产从全国第15位跃居第9位；人均占有粮食增加到722公斤，比全国平均数高一倍，名列第一；从1983年起，粮食出口量和人均交售商品粮连续6年夺冠；粮食商品率连年在50％以上。1983年以来，全省累计出口粮食1051万吨，其中玉米出口量居全国第一位，在国际市场上享有盛誉。
    粮食生产的进步，使整个吉林农业呈现出全面发展的新格局。首先受益的是畜牧业。10年间肉类生产量增长1.62倍，奶类产量增长2.82倍，禽蛋产量增长2.73倍。人们的饮食结构发生显著变化。吉林省委、省政府把1989年定为“畜牧年”，争取三年内做到肉食自给，继而努力做好粮食转化工作，把吉林变为畜产品调出省。
    直接为粮食生产服务的农田防护林为吉林林海又添新绿。素有八百里瀚海之称的白城地区不仅初步锁住了风沙，也使农田形成林网化，经济效益十分可观。从1980年到1988年，全省防护林比重由27％增加到31.8％，经济林也由2％上升为11％。
    随着粮食深加工的开展，以各地资源为依托的乡镇企业也以较快步伐前进。1988年，全省乡镇企业产值突破100亿元大关。今年经过调整充实完善，总产值仍可达到130亿元。
