Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 27th (Reporters Zhang Baorui, Xu Xiaoping) During the 40th anniversary of National Day, the cultural life in the capital presents a scene of a thousand flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending.

The first Chinese Film Festival, which opened on September 21st, has successively screened 40 excellent films including "The Founding Ceremony," "The Baise Uprising," and "The Republic Will Not Forget." The second Chinese Art Festival, held from September 15th to October 5th with Beijing as the main venue, features a rich and diverse program. Foreign art troupes such as the Moscow Model Ballet from the Soviet Union and the National Art Troupe from North Korea also came to Beijing to perform.

The "National Television Single-Episode Plays, Short Plays, and Sketches Exhibition" began on September 20th and is currently being broadcast on Central Television. Central Television will also broadcast a grand gala for National Day, "I Love You, China," on the evening of September 30th, and a grand ethnic minority song and dance gala on October 2nd.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles have organized a competition and evaluation of literary and artistic works to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Recently, they have also introduced more than 20 new plays or programs to the capital's stage. The Beijing Municipal Performing Arts Company has organized 12 performing arts troupes from the capital to perform in factories, rural areas, the military, and schools. The China Coal Mine Art Troupe, Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, and Beijing Quyi Troupe will perform excellent one-act plays, Peking Opera "Deceiving the Wife to Marry the Sister," and cross-talk respectively at Shougang, Beijing Coal Chemical Plant, and Beijing Air Conditioner Factory. The Beijing Children's Art Troupe will take the performance to the suburbs.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 27th (Reporter Zhao Lanying) On the eve of National Day, Shanghai's cultural scene is vibrant and bustling with a variety of performances.

Walking through Shanghai today, there are cultural activities everywhere in families, alleys, streets, schools, offices, shops, military camps, docks, and factories. There are countless activities such as the "Chongming Island Singing Contest," "Changning Cultural Park Expo," and "Yellow River Song." Each district also holds a "Family Cultural Arts Festival." The "I Love China, I Love Shanghai Singing Contest" held on September 16th pushed the mass cultural activities to a climax. Ten choirs composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, intellectuals, and cadres performed more than 40 songs.

Professional artists are dedicated to presenting excellent works. The 89 Shanghai Cultural Arts Festival, which opened recently, has 80 performances, more than half of which are newly created plays. Shanghai Opera House's "One Night of Love and Death" portrays the image of a Communist Party member in municipal engineering construction. Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe's "White Island" describes the life of hydrological survey team members who have lived on a lonely island for many years. "Looking Up to the Sky and Roaring" is an opera presented by the Shanghai Opera House, depicting Yue Fei's loyal heart to the country.

The stage is rich and varied, and the screen is equally dazzling. Newly produced feature films, animated films, and educational films such as "The Last Aristocrat," "Reunion," "A Xing, A Xin," "Mountain and Water Affection," and "Cockfight" appear on the screen. The screen is also full of performances: from September 20th to October 10th, nearly 100 episodes of domestic and foreign TV dramas, more than 100 episodes of TV documentaries, 12 art galas, and 20 films will be broadcast. The 18-episode TV series "Shanghai's Morning," the TV drama "New House Behind the Old House," and the opera film "Loan Official" are all very innovative.

    新华社北京9月27日电　（记者张宝瑞、徐小萍）国庆40周年期间，首都文化生活呈现百花齐放，万紫千红的景象。
    第一届中国电影节自9月21日开幕以来，陆续推出了《开国大典》、《百色起义》、《共和国不会忘记》等40部优秀影片。9月15日至10月5日举行的第二届中国艺术节，以北京为主会场，节目丰富多采。苏联莫斯科模范芭蕾舞团、朝鲜国家艺术团等外国文艺团体也来京演出助兴。
    9月20日开始举办的“全国电视单本剧、短剧、小品展播”目前正在中央电视台播出。中央电视台还将在9月30日晚上播出国庆大型晚会《我爱你，中国》，10月2日播出大型少数民族歌舞晚会。
    北京市文化局和市文联为庆祝建国40周年，进行了文艺作品征集评奖工作，最近还向首都文艺舞台推出20余台新剧目或新节目。北京市演出公司组织首都12个文艺团队深入厂矿、农村、部队、学校演出。中国煤矿文工团、北京京剧院、北京曲艺团将分别到首钢、北京焦化厂、北京空调器厂演出优秀独幕话剧、京剧《诓妻嫁妹》和相声。北京儿童艺术剧团将把戏送到京郊农村。北京交响乐团、中国铁路文工团也为首都高校校园带去大学生喜爱的文艺节目。
    北京市总工会、团市委除在工人和青年学生中组织开展大唱革命歌曲活动外，还将在天安门广场举办集体舞比赛。
    据新华社上海9月27日电　（记者赵兰英）国庆前夕，上海文艺园地生机盎然，百花争妍。
    漫步今日上海，家庭、里弄、街道、学校、机关、商店、军营、码头、工厂，到处都有文艺活动。“崇明海岛争艳歌会”、“长宁文化游园博览会”、“黄浦之歌”等等，数不胜数，更有各区举办的“家庭文化艺术节”。9月16日举办的“我爱中华、我爱上海歌会”，则将群众文化活动推向高潮。由工、农、兵、学、商、知识分子、干部分别组成的十支歌队，共演唱了40余首歌曲。
    专业文艺工作者致力于奉献精品。日前开幕的89上海文化艺术节，共有80台文艺节目上演，其中一半以上是新创作的剧目。上海沪剧院上演的《一夜生死恋》，表现了市政工程建设中的共产党员形象。上海青年话剧团的《白岛》，则描述长年生活于孤岛上的水文勘测队员的生活。《仰天长啸》是上海歌剧院推出的歌剧，表现了岳飞精忠报国的胸怀。
    舞台丰富多采，银幕、荧屏同样璀璨夺目。《最后的贵族》、《喜相逢》、《阿星、阿新》、《山水情》、《斗鸡》等新摄制的故事片、美术片、科教片出现于银幕。荧屏更是好戏连台：从9月20日至10月10日的20天时间内，将有近百集中外电视剧、100多集电视纪录片、12台文艺晚会、20部电影播出。18集电视连续剧《上海的早晨》、电视剧《新楼后头是老屋》、戏曲片《赊官》等都很有新意。
