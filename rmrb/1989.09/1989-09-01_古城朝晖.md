In the southern part of Hebei Province, Handan, and in the central part, Baoding, both are known as ancient cities. Within these two ancient cities, there are residential areas that people yearn for—these are:

**Yongxinli**

Yongxinli is a residential area in the Congtai District of Handan City. Here, over 1,300 households live in an atmosphere filled with socialist civilization.

In recent years, activities such as civilized courtyards, civilized buildings, five-good families, and civilized citizens have been carried out here. Among the residents, good wives, good husbands, good mothers-in-law, good daughters-in-law, good daughters, and good sons-in-law are periodically selected; households help and learn from each other, respect and love each other. They have also compiled the content of civilized activities into a three-character classic: "Respect neighbors, help each other, be like friends. Respect the elderly, love children, one child is good, avoid indulgence. Brothers love each other, sisters-in-law are close, live in harmony, with one heart. A family, uphold public morality, do not believe in superstitions, do not gamble. Practice the Five Loves, learn from Lei Feng, abide by the law, resist bad trends. Weddings should be modern, funerals should be frugal. Save more, rely on thrift, work hard, and have a sweet life..."

Residents all know how to recite and follow these principles, promoting the construction of spiritual civilization.

**Tangjia Hutong**

Tangjia Hutong in Baoding City is an ancient and ordinary street. Walking into the 59th courtyard of this hutong, people will notice a sanitation duty board. The front of the board lists the names of those on duty, and the back lists four regulations. This duty board was made and used in 1956 and has been in use for 33 years. For over 30 years, this duty board has been passed around among the households, year after year, day after day, without interruption. The people living here, regardless of age or gender, silently follow the regulations on the board to do a good job of sanitation and security.

The 59th courtyard is a microcosm of Tangjia Hutong. In this street, family members, neighbors, and even external interactions are characterized by unity, friendship, and mutual assistance.

Now, the commercial stalls managed by the Tangjia Hutong street office have developed to over 10, with an annual profit of 130,000 yuan. Over the years, they have consistently adhered to civilized production and quality service, strictly following the country's policies and regulations.

    古城朝晖
    河北南部的邯郸，中部的保定，都被称为古城。在这两座古城中，也都有一个使人向往的居民区，他们是——
    永新里
    永新里是邯郸市丛台区的一个居民区。这里的1300多户居民生活在充满社会主义文明气氛之中。
    几年来，这里相继开展了文明院、文明楼、五好家庭、文明市民等活动；在居民户中定期评选好妻子、好丈夫、好婆婆、好媳妇、好闺女、好女婿；户与户互帮互学、互敬互爱。她们还把文明活动内容编写成三字经：“对邻居，要尊重，互帮助，亲如朋。敬老人，爱儿童，一孩好，忌娇纵。兄弟爱，妯娌亲，和睦处，同一心。一家人，守公德，不迷信，不赌博。讲五爱，学雷锋，守法纪，顶歪风。婚喜事，要新办，丧葬事，要节俭。多积蓄，靠勤俭，劳动富，日子甜。……”居民们人人会念会背，照着去做，推动了精神文明的建设。
  唐家胡同
    保定市唐家胡同，是一个古老而普通的街道。走进这个胡同59号院，人们都会注意到一块卫生值日牌。牌的正面写着值日的姓名，背面写着4条规定。这块值日牌是1956年制作并使用的，到如今已有33个年头了。30多年来，这值日牌年复一年、日复一日地各户轮流，从未间断。住在这里的人们，不管男女老幼，都默默地按照牌上的规定做好卫生和安全保卫工作。
    59号院是唐家胡同的一个缩影。在这个街道上，家庭成员之间、邻里之间，以至对外交往中，团结友爱、助人为乐已蔚然成风。
    如今，唐家胡同街道办的工商摊点已发展到10多家，年盈利额增长到13万元。几年来，始终如一地坚持文明生产、优质服务，严格遵循国家的政策法规。
