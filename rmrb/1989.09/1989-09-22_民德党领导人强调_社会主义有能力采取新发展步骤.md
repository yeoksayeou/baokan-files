German Democratic Republic (GDR) Central Committee Politburo Member and Central Secretary Egon Krenz emphasized in a meeting with workers in the Potsdam District on September 20 that the 40-year history of the GDR has proven that socialism has the ability to take new development steps.

He said that the GDR has a clear socialist development plan, and is currently preparing for the 12th Party Congress in accordance with this plan, striving to prove in the coming decades that socialism has the ability to continuously develop to higher stages.

Krenz said that the GDR absolutely will not accept the so-called reforms being peddled by capitalist profit economists. He pointed out that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is the greatest victory won by the German working class after more than a century of struggle, and the GDR will spare no effort to develop this victory and will not easily give it up.

Krenz told the workers that the GDR will continue to implement a policy of unifying economic development with the improvement of people's lives.
