    Yuan Baohua, the president of the China Enterprise Management Association, said at the symposium on strategies to revitalize key enterprises on September 14th: The factory director responsibility system stipulated in China's Enterprise Law must continue to be implemented and will not be changed; in the process of implementation, it should be gradually improved, but improvement should not be misunderstood as changing or abandoning this enterprise leadership system.

    Recently, some enterprise leaders have had some confusion in their understanding. They see the emphasis on the enterprise party organization playing a political core role and mistakenly believe this conflicts with the "central position" of the director as stipulated in the Enterprise Law. They think the factory director responsibility system will be changed, leading to the question of whether the "center" or the "core" is more important, and causing uncertainty among directors and secretaries.

    Yuan Baohua addressed this situation by pointing out that the factory director responsibility system is stipulated in the Enterprise Law and is in line with Deng Xiaoping's consistent thinking. It is also a summary of China's decades of experience and lessons in this area. The factory director responsibility system is in line with China's national conditions, the requirements of modern large-scale production, and the basic line of "one center, two basic points." It should not be shaken.

    He said that implementing the factory director responsibility system is a process of gradual improvement. For example, how to combine the factory director responsibility system with strengthening the political core role of the enterprise party organization, and how to combine the factory director responsibility system with relying on the working class and strengthening democratic management are all issues that need to be continuously addressed in practice.

    Both directors and secretaries are leaders of the enterprise, and their task is to run the enterprise well, with a common goal. Do not oppose things that are not contradictory. An important condition for implementing the factory director responsibility system well is to continuously improve the quality of enterprise cadres.

    袁宝华在搞活大型骨干企业研讨会上强调
　　坚持实行厂长负责制
　  厂长中心地位不动摇　党组织核心作用要加强
    本报讯　记者艾丰报道：中国企业管理协会会长袁宝华14日在搞活大型骨干企业对策研讨会上说：我国《企业法》规定的厂长负责制要继续实行，不会改变；在实行的过程中要逐步完善，但不能把完善误解为改变或放弃这一企业领导制度。
    最近有些企业的领导人认识上产生一定程度的迷惑，他们看到重申企业党组织要发挥政治核心作用，就以为这同企业法中规定的厂长“中心地位”发生矛盾，以为要改变厂长负责制，以致提出“‘中心’大还是‘核心’大”的问题，产生厂长、书记“二心不定”的情况。
    袁宝华同志针对这种情况指出，厂长负责制是《企业法》规定的，实行厂长负责制，不仅是邓小平同志的一贯思想，也是总结我国几十年这方面经验教训的结果。厂长负责制符合中国国情，符合现代化大生产的要求，符合“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线，对它不应产生动摇。
    他说，贯彻实施厂长负责制有一个逐步完善的过程。比如实行厂长负责制如何同加强企业党组织的政治核心作用结合起来，实行厂长负责制如何同依靠工人阶级、加强民主管理结合起来，都是在实践中需要不断解决的问题。
    厂长、书记都是企业中的领导者，他们的任务都是把企业搞好，目标是共同的。不要把并不矛盾的东西对立起来。实行好厂长负责制很重要的一条就是要不断提高企业干部的素质。
