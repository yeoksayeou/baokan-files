Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 1st.

Wang Bingqian stated at the National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting on August 31 that to address the fiscal issues of the year, the primary task of finance is to take necessary measures to minimize the fiscal deficit for the year.

Wang Bingqian said that it is certain that if a significant deficit occurs this year, it will be detrimental to stabilizing the economy and the national situation, as well as to promoting the rectification and deepening of reforms. Therefore, according to the decision of the State Council, in July, the Ministry of Finance held a national finance work conference. The conference analyzed the current fiscal and economic situation, and arranged for further measures to increase revenue and control expenditures:

	(1) Strictly enforce tax collection to ensure that industrial and commercial tax revenues exceed the target. Tax collection must be firm, adhering to the rule of law, strictly controlling tax exemptions and reductions, and correcting any unauthorized exemptions. Customs duties and import product taxes and value-added taxes collected by customs must be collected to the greatest extent possible. Export tax refunds must be strictly controlled according to the budget and cannot be exceeded. The State Council has decided that in September and October, a comprehensive inspection and rectification of the tax payment order of individual and private enterprises in urban and rural areas nationwide will be conducted to plug revenue loopholes. This work will not only increase some fiscal revenue but also has significant implications for rectifying economic order and adjusting social distribution inequities.

	(2) Promote the implementation of various revenue-increasing measures. Each region and department must act from the perspective of overall interests, strengthen organizational leadership, and ensure that all revenue-increasing measures are fully implemented. To motivate local governments to organize revenue, the State Council has decided that for the national budget adjustment fund, in addition to the originally planned sharing between local and central governments, the excess amount can be appropriately allocated more to local governments. For the special consumption tax on color TVs, a portion will also be allocated to local finances. For various financial bonds issued by the state, propaganda and sales efforts must be strengthened to encourage everyone to prioritize purchasing them and sharing the national burden.

	(3) Deepen enterprise reforms and focus on enterprise profit improvement. The enterprise management contract responsibility system must be continuously improved and developed, especially to enhance the vitality of large and medium-sized enterprises and create better conditions for equal competition. At the same time, it is required to appropriately adjust the contract base and turnover ratio that are too low; enterprises that fail to complete their contract tasks must make up the difference with their own funds and cannot have profits without losses; specific methods must be formulated for enterprise price increases to ensure that most of the revenue is turned over to the finance. Enterprises must be classified and ranked according to their operating conditions, and specific requirements for profit improvement must be proposed, strictly controlling enterprise losses, adhering to budget subsidies, and not compensating for excess losses. In the cleanup and rectification of companies, it is necessary to strictly follow the relevant regulations of the State Council to ensure that state assets are not damaged, and companies' legacy issues must be resolved independently and cannot be passed on to the finance.

	(4) Clean up overdue taxes and taxes occupied by specialized banks. The State Council has instructed relevant departments to organize joint cleanup teams, with a State Council leader responsible for this work. The People's Bank is preparing to allocate a certain amount of startup funds to address the "triangular debt" problem among enterprises and to activate the circulation of funds and enterprise production. Enterprises' realized sales revenue and recovered goods funds must first be used to pay taxes. Specialized banks managing treasury business must not occupy or refuse to accept taxes. In mid-August, the financial department held a national treasury work conference to study how to strengthen the collection and reporting of treasury funds to ensure that fiscal revenue is timely and fully deposited. Through hard work, the overdue taxes of enterprises must be minimized.

	(5) Continue to reduce and control fiscal expenditures. The policy of tightening fiscal spending must be strictly implemented and cannot be wavered. Central fiscal expenditures, except for key construction investments, defense spending, domestic and foreign debt repayment and interest, and price subsidy expenditures, other expenditures must be reduced by 5% based on the budget. Local expenditures must also be compressed according to this proportion. Each region, department, and unit must have a holistic perspective, truly establish the idea of living a tight budget, resolutely overcome the phenomenon of extravagant spending and waste, and strictly prohibit enterprises and units from issuing excessive bonuses, subsidies, and goods. Social purchasing power must be further compressed, and all possible expenditures must be reduced. At the same time, neither the central nor local governments should open new expenditure items; except for major natural disasters and the suppression of riots, no new expenditures should be added; funds allocated by relevant departments should not be distributed downward.

	(6) Continue to conduct tax, financial, and price inspections. This year's inspection must start early and be strict, and some new content must be added. It is planned to start in September and end before the New Year. In addition to the content of previous years' inspections, the cleanup of "small treasuries" must also be included as an inspection item. This inspection must be closely linked with the punishment of corruption and the strengthening of clean governance, and with the promotion of increased production, saving, increased revenue, and expenditure control to achieve new results.

    王丙乾谈当前财政首要任务
    实行增收节支六条措施
    尽量缩小财政收支差额
    新华社北京9月1日电  王丙乾8月31日在全国人大常委会会议上谈到解决全年财政问题的几项措施时说，当前财政的首要任务，就是要采取必要的措施，尽量缩小今年财政收支差额。
    王丙乾说，可以肯定，如果今年出现较多的赤字，对稳定经济和全国局势，对推进治理整顿和深化改革，都是不利的。为此，根据国务院的决定，7月间，财政部召开了全国财政工作会议，分析了当前财政和经济形势，研究部署了进一步增收节支的措施：
    （一）狠抓税收征管，确保工商税收任务超额完成。税收要硬起来，要坚持依法治税，严格控制减免税，越权减免的要坚决纠正。关税和海关代征的进口商品产品税、增值税要千方百计力争多收。出口退税要严格按预算控制，不能突破。国务院决定，在9、10月份，对全国城乡个体工商业户和私营企业的纳税秩序进行一次全面检查整顿，堵塞收入漏洞。这项工作不仅可以增加一些财政收入，而且对整顿经济秩序、调整社会分配不公问题也有重大意义。
    （二）抓紧各项增收措施的落实。要求各地区各部门从全局利益出发，加强组织领导，保证各项增收措施如数完成。为调动地方组织收入积极性，国务院决定对国家预算调节基金，在原定地方和中央分成的基础上，超收部分可给地方适当多分一些，对特别消费税中的彩电收入，也分给地方财政一部分。对国家发行的各种财政债券，要加强宣传、推销工作，动员大家优先购买，为国分忧。
    （三）深化企业改革，狠抓企业扭亏增盈。要继续完善和发展企业经营承包责任制，特别是要千方百计增强大中型企业的活力，为他们创造更好的平等竞争的条件。同时，要求对企业承包基数和上交比例过低的进行适当调整；完不成承包任务的企业，必须用自有资金补交，不能包盈不包亏；企业涨价收入要制定具体办法，保证大部分上交财政。要对企业的经营情况分类排队，提出扭亏增盈的具体要求，严格控制企业亏损，坚持按预算补贴，超亏不补。在清理整顿公司中，一定要按照国务院有关规定办事，保证国家资产不受损失，公司的遗留问题要自行处理，不能推给财政。
    （四）清理企业拖欠税款和专业银行占压的税款。国务院已责成有关部门组织联合清理小组，由国务院一位领导同志负责抓这项工作。人民银行准备拿出一定数额的启动资金，以解决企业之间的“三角债”问题，把资金流通与企业生产搞活。企业实现的销售收入及清理收回的货款，要首先交纳税款。经理国库业务的专业银行不得占压税款，也不得拒收税款。8月中旬财政部门专门召开了全国国库工作会议，研究了如何加强库款的收纳入库和报解工作，以保证财政收入及时足额入库。通过努力工作，要把企业拖欠的税款压缩到最低限度。
    （五）继续节减和控制财政支出。要坚决贯彻紧缩财政的方针，对此不能动摇。中央财政支出，除重点建设投资、国防费、国内外债务还本付息和价格补贴支出以外，其他支出一律在预算基础上削减5％，地方各项支出也要参照这个比例压缩。各地区、各部门、各单位要有全局观念，真正树立过紧日子的思想，坚决克服花钱大手大脚、铺张浪费的现象，坚决禁止企业单位滥发奖金、补贴和实物，进一步压缩社会集团购买力，把一切可以节减的开支都压缩下来。同时，中央和地方都不要再开新的增支口子；除特大自然灾害和平息暴乱的一些特殊急需外，不再追加新的支出；有关部门掌握的待分配资金，也不要再向下分配。
    （六）继续开展税收、财务、物价大检查。今年的大检查要从早从严，并增加一些新的内容。准备从9月份开始，新年前结束。除以往年度检查的内容外，要把清理“小金库”也作为一项检查内容，并且要把这次大检查同惩治腐败、加强廉政建设紧密结合起来，同开展增产节约、增收节支紧密结合起来，取得新的成果。
