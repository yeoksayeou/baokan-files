The article “The Source of Vitality” praises the strong faith and lofty ideals of the workers of Jilin Chemical Industry Company (Jilin Chemical).

Listen, the workers of Jilin Chemical sing the “Song of Ideals”: “Ideals are distant, yet they are real; ideals are the sails of life, the paintings of reality; ideals are by your side, under your feet; ideals are on your post.”

It is with this spiritual realm that, in recent years, the workers of Jilin Chemical have realized their ideals through their posts, overcome difficulties, and striven upward, bringing about remarkable changes in China's first chemical industrial base. The superiority of the socialist system is well demonstrated here.

What is worth pondering is, for such a large enterprise like Jilin Chemical, with many people and departments, it is complex enough. Why do they stride so firmly and swiftly on the socialist path? The workers of Jilin Chemical give a vivid answer:

“Reform is the sail, the four cardinal principles are the helm. Highly raise the sail, steadily hold the helm, and the ship of the enterprise will sail swiftly and steadily.” In other words, in Jilin Chemical, from the leadership to the workers, they take economic construction as the center and organically combine the two fundamental points. The enterprise leaders insist on doing good ideological and political work among the ten thousand workers, cultivating the enterprise spirit, and fully bringing into play the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters. At the same time, they fully implement the contract responsibility system, with everyone shouldering responsibilities. The workers and the enterprise form a community of interests. In carrying out these tasks, Party members and cadres take the lead. Therefore, during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing in May and June this year, the workers of Jilin Chemical had firm beliefs, eliminated various interferences, guarded their posts, and worked hard to create outstanding achievements.

The experience of Jilin Chemical is worth noting and learning from, especially for units that have once relaxed ideological and political work and taken a detour. It tells people how to adhere to the four cardinal principles and how to deepen enterprise reform. If the “helm” is not held steadily, people will waver about the direction of the ship and cannot form a powerful combined force; if the “sail” of reform is not fully raised, the speed of sailing cannot be accelerated, both of which will harm the cause of socialist construction. The two fundamental points must be symmetrical and complementary. At no time should one be emphasized while the other is weakened. Only by “steadily holding the helm and highly raising the sail” can the ship be guaranteed to sail in the socialist direction, break the waves, and advance fearlessly!

　　稳稳掌住舵　高高扬起帆
　　本报评论员
      《活力的源泉》这篇通讯，作者以饱满的热情，讴歌了吉化职工的坚强信念和崇高理想。
    你听，吉化职工谱写的《理想之歌》：“理想是遥远的，又是现实的；理想是生活的帆，现实的画；理想在身边、在脚下；理想就在你的岗位上。”
    正是以这样一种精神境界，这些年来，吉化职工通过自己的岗位实现自己的理想，克服困难，奋发向上，使我国第一个化工基地发生了令人瞩目的变化，社会主义制度的优越性在这里得到较好的体现。
    这里，很值得人们思考的是，像吉化这样大的企业，人多部门多，讲复杂，那是够复杂的了，为什么他们在社会主义道路上步子迈得那样坚定，迈得那样快？还是吉化职工回答得形象：
  “改革是帆，四项基本原则是舵，高高扬起帆，稳稳掌住舵，企业这条船才会快速平稳地行驶。”也就是说，在吉化，从领导到职工，以经济建设为中心，把两个基本点有机地结合起来了，企业领导在十万职工中，坚持做好思想政治工作，培育企业精神，充分发挥职工的主人翁责任感；同时，全面推行承包经营责任制，人人肩上有担子，职工和企业形成了利益共同体。在开展这些工作中，党员干部作开路先锋。正因为如此，在今年五六月的动乱和北京反革命暴乱期间，吉化职工有着坚定的信念，排除种种干扰，坚守岗位，努力生产，创造了优异的成绩。
    吉化的经验，很值得重视和借鉴。尤其是对于一度放松了思想政治工作、走过弯路的单位来说，是一面镜子。它告诉人们怎样去坚持四项基本原则，怎样去深化企业改革。如果“舵”不掌稳，人们就会对航船的方向发生动摇，形不成强大的合力；如果改革的“帆”不张满，就不能加快航行的速度，都会损害社会主义建设事业。两个基本点必须对称，必须相称，任何时候都不能只顾一面而削弱另一面。只有“稳稳掌住舵，高高扬起帆”，才能保证航船沿着社会主义方向，破浪前进，一往无前！
