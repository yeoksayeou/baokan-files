The village of Cai Jia in Beigang Township, Yueyang City, has 21 party members and village cadres with serious economic problems, 9 of whom have committed criminal offenses. The former district People's Congress representative and village party branch secretary, Li Yuewu, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling several thousand yuan over three years. The village party branch committee member and accountant, Yuan Xiaohua, used methods such as not recording income to embezzle public funds amounting to several thousand yuan. The construction team leader, Zhou Huacheng, when building a village-run school, bribed village cadres with items such as electric fans and tape recorders worth nearly a thousand yuan. After receiving the bribes, they increased the construction funds for Zhou Huacheng by 190,000 yuan.

One of the main reasons for the lawlessness and indiscipline of some party members and cadres in Cai Jia Village is the chaotic financial management in the village. According to regulations, invoices for expenditures must have the signature of the person handling the transaction, the destination of the expenditure, and approval by the person in charge. However, in this village, expenditures can be reimbursed and recorded with just a word from certain village cadres. From 1986 to 1988, the village's expenditures on dining, gift-giving, and transportation alone amounted to over 120,000 yuan, of which 85,200 yuan was recorded with blank receipts. According to regulations, all invoices for expenditures should be approved by the village cadre in charge of finances. However, in Cai Jia Village, not only do all village cadres have the authority to approve and reimburse expenditures, but even some relatives and friends of the village cadres can sign and reimburse expenditures. For example, Li Yuewu's cousin, the driver Li Shiding, signed and reimbursed 4,670 yuan over two years. The accountant, Ye Bingzhu, not only manages the accounts and money but also approves and reimburses expenditures, embezzling funds in the process. The accountant, Yuan Xiaohua, knew that blank receipts could not be recorded, but he still repeatedly violated regulations, using blank receipts to record 180 transactions amounting to 41,834 yuan, thereby inflating expenditures and underreporting income, embezzling and misappropriating public funds.

Left Yiguang of Suining County, Jiangsu Province, writes: Since 1985, Wangqiao Village has had chaotic financial management, with blank paper receipts being used for accounting, resulting in severe losses to the collective economy. The main reason is that financial management is not centralized. The village has not established a cashier system, and all village cadres can approve and use funds. At the end of the year when settling accounts, the accountant asks the village cadres for receipts to settle accounts, and the village cadres then write blank receipts to deceive. Over the years, the village has used blank receipts to replace receipts for 54 transactions, with blank receipts accounting for about 85% of all receipts. Over the years, village cadres have used blank receipts to receive an additional 2,593 yuan in subsidies, and 31,728.60 yuan in entertainment expenses have also been mostly reimbursed with blank receipts.

### 财务管理混乱　违纪干部钻空

    财务管理混乱　违纪干部钻空
    蔡家村报账凭干部一句话
    王桥村的白条单据满天飞
    湖南岳阳市郊区人民检察院  侯循抬　胡春琳　杨泽明来信：岳阳市北港乡蔡家村现有严重经济问题的党员和村组干部21人，触犯刑律的9人。原区人大代表、村党支部书记李岳武，在3年里贪污受贿达数千元。村党支部委员、村会计袁小华，采取收入不入账等手段，贪污公款数千元。村基建队队长周华清承建村办学校时，向村干部行贿电风扇、收录机等价值近千元的东西。他们受贿后，为周华清增加基建费1.9万元。
    蔡家村一些党员干部违法乱纪的一个重要原因是，村里的财务管理十分混乱。按规定，发票入账，必须要有经手人签名，有开支去向，有主管人审批。但这个村却凭某些村干部的一句话就可以报销入账。1986年至1988年，这个村仅吃喝、送礼、用车的开支达12万多元，其中白条子入账达85200元。按规定，凡入账的发票，应由主管财务的村干部审批。但是蔡家村不仅村干部人人有权批条报销，而且村干部的一些亲朋好友也可以签字报销。如李岳武的堂弟、小车司机李石定在两年里，签字报销了4670多元。会计管账、出纳管钱，可是，蔡家村会计叶丙舟不仅管账管钱，而且批条批钱，从中贪污。会计袁小华知道白条子不能入账，但他仍多次违反规定，用白条子报账180多笔，金额41834元，从而多报开支，少计收入，贪污侵占公款。
    江苏阜宁县硕集乡委左一广来信：王桥村自1985年以来，财务管理混乱，白纸单据报账，造成集体经济严重损失。其主要原因是：财务管理不归口。村里未建立出纳制度，村组干部人人可以批条用钱。年终结账时，会计找村组干部要单据结账，村组干部就打白条瞒天过海。几年来，全村用白条子代替单据的有54笔，白条子占所有单据的85％左右。几年来，村组干部靠打白条，多领补贴2593元，招待费开支31728.60元也大多靠白条报销。
