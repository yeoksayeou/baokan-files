The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing, said today that Prince Sihanouk and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea's refusal to achieve a ceasefire before reaching a comprehensive settlement is reasonable. China believes this is justified.

Li Zhaoxing made these remarks in response to a journalist's question. The journalist asked, "Some people have proposed that before the relevant parties reach a comprehensive settlement on the Cambodian issue, the various factions in Cambodia should first achieve a ceasefire. What is China's comment on this?"

Li Zhaoxing said, "At present, what should be of serious concern to the international community is that Vietnam still lacks the sincerity to politically resolve the Cambodian issue. It continues to play tricks on the issue of troop withdrawal and sets various obstacles for the comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian issue. A ceasefire should be a component of the comprehensive settlement. Since Vietnam and the Hun Sen side refuse to reach a comprehensive settlement, there cannot be a genuine ceasefire."

    外交部发言人谈柬停火问题
    赞成西哈努克和民柬联合政府立场
    新华社北京9月21日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天说，西哈努克亲王和民柬联合政府拒绝在未达成一项全面解决协议之前实现停火，中国认为这是有道理的。
    李肇星是在回答记者问题时说这番话的。有记者问，有人提出，在有关各方就柬问题达成一项全面解决协议之前，柬各派先实现停火。中国对此有何评论？
    李肇星说，当前，应该引起国际社会严重警惕的是，越南依然缺乏政治解决柬问题的诚意。它继续在撤军问题上玩弄花招，为柬问题的全面解决设置种种障碍。停火应该是全面解决办法的一个组成部分。既然越南、洪森方面拒绝达成全面解决协议，就不可能有真正的停火。
