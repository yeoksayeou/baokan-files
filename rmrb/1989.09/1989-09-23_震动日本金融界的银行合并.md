The seventh-largest commercial bank in Japan, Mitsui Bank, and the eighth-largest, Taiyo Kobe Bank, have decided to merge on April 1 next year, tentatively named "Taiyo Kobe Mitsui Bank."

People have noticed that these two banks were not particularly well-known before, but after the merger, their capital will reach 39.6501 trillion yen, second only to the world's largest commercial bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and will instantly become the second-largest in the world. The loan amount will be the largest in the world. The decision announced by the two banks on August 29 has caused a stir in Japan's financial circles. Japanese officials believe that this merger signals that Japan's financial restructuring has entered a new phase. In the future, mergers of medium and small banks will follow, and competition among banks will become more intense.

The merger of the two banks is a product of Japan's ongoing financial reforms. For decades after the war, Japan implemented a restrictive financial system, mainly including restrictions on interest rates, the scope of financial institution operations, and foreign exchange transactions, which made financial institutions specialized. This financial system played a role in regulating funds and ensuring that enterprises had a stable source of funds during Japan's post-war economic development. However, since the 1973 oil crisis, Japan's economy has shifted to a low-growth track, and the shortage of funds has turned into surplus. The financial system that was once suitable for high-speed economic growth is increasingly incompatible with the new economic changes. Therefore, financial reforms are necessary to improve the efficiency of financial institutions and achieve rationalization.

The purpose of this merger is also to complement each other, to take the strengths and make up for the weaknesses, and to enhance competitiveness. First, the merger can enhance strength. Facing financial liberalization and internationalization, both banks feel that their strength is insufficient, and they are very concerned that the gap with the leading banks will widen. At the press conference held on August 29, the president of Mitsui Bank said: "Facing financial internationalization and liberalization, if a bank does not reach a certain scale (total assets), it is also meaningless to talk about quality (profit). As an international comprehensive financial institution, if it always stays in the middle, it will be anxious about the future."

Second, the merger can expand the business network. Currently, the proportion of the service industry in Japan's economy is increasing, and large enterprises that require huge equipment investments are decreasing. The focus of bank loans has shifted from large enterprises to medium and small enterprises and individuals. However, Mitsui Bank has a sparse domestic business network and cannot adapt to this change. Increasing branches requires approval from the Ministry of Finance, and in Japan's cities where land is expensive, increasing branches also requires huge costs. It can be said that except for a merger, there is no way to increase a large number of branches at once.

Third, taking the strengths and making up for the weaknesses, and playing to the strengths. Mitsui Bank has advantages in securities and international business, while Taiyo Kobe has advantages in transactions with medium and small enterprises and individuals. After the merger, it can better cope with the new situation of financial reform that is about to come. In addition, the merger can save investment in electronicization.

However, the merger of the two banks will not increase profits. Moreover, after the merger, the number of employees of the two banks will reach 23,000, exceeding the number of the first-ranked Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. How to "reduce swelling" is still a difficult problem.

The financial circles in Europe and America are also paying close attention to the merger of Mitsui and Taiyo Kobe Banks. A survey by U.S. newspapers this year shows that, ranked by asset size, the top 10 largest banks in the world are mostly Japanese banks. After the merger of the two banks, Japan will have another bank with assets ranking second in the world. This undoubtedly puts considerable pressure on the financial circles in Europe and America. A large bank in Britain expressed unease, saying that this new trend in Japan's financial circles "will make the competition for dominance in the international market even more intense for Japanese banks in the future."

    震动日本金融界的银行合并
    刘迪
    位居日本商业银行第七位的三井银行和第八位的太阳神户银行决定于明年4月1日合并，暂取名“太阳神户三井银行”。
    人们注意到，这两家银行原来并不怎么出名，但是合并后它的资金量将达到39.6501万亿日元，仅次于世界最大的商业银行——日本第一劝业银行，一举跃居世界第二位，贷款额则居世界第一位。两银行8月29日宣布的这一决定已在日本金融界引起震动，日本有关人士认为，这次合并预示着日本金融业的改组已进入一个新的阶段。今后，中小银行的兼并将接踵而至，各银行之间的竞争将更加激烈。
    两银行合并是日本正在进行的金融改革的产物。战后几十年，日本实行一种限制性金融体制，主要包括对利率、金融机构经营范围以及对外交易等方面的限制，使金融机构专业化。这种金融体制在战后日本经济发展过程中，调节了资金，保证企业获得稳定的资金来源，对经济发展起了促进作用。但是，自从1973年石油危机后，日本经济走上低速增长轨道，资金不足已转为有余，过去那种适应经济高速增长的金融体制已越来越不适应经济的新变化。为此，必须进行金融改革，使金融机构提高效率、实现合理化。
    这次两行合并的目的也就在于互为补充，取长补短，加强竞争力。首先，合并可增强实力。面对金融自由化、国际化，两行均感到实力不足，它们非常担心与位居前几名的大银行的距离拉大。在8月29日举行的记者招待会上，三井银行行长说：“面临金融国际化、自由化，如果银行不达到一定的量（资产总额），也就谈不上质（利润）。作为国际综合金融机构，如果总是居于中游，就会对未来感到不安。”
    第二，合并可扩大营业网络。目前，日本经济中服务业的比重上升，需要庞大设备投资的大企业减少，银行贷款重点对象已由大企业转为中小企业和个人。但是，三井银行国内营业网络稀少，无法适应这一转变。增加营业所，必须得到大藏省的许可，而且，在寸土寸金的日本城市中增加营业所也需要巨额费用。可以说除合并外无法一举增加大量的营业所。
    第三，取长补短，发挥优势。三井银行在证券和国际业务方面具有优势，太阳神户则在对中小企业与个人交易方面具有优势，合并后可更好地应付即将到来的金融改革的新局面。此外，合并还可以节约电子化方面的投资。
    但是，两家银行合并后，利润并不会提高。而且，合并后两行职员人数达到2.3万人，超过居于第一位的第一劝业银行的人数，如何“消肿”尚属难题。
    欧美金融界对三井、太阳神户银行的合并也十分关注。今年美国报刊调查表明，按资产额排列，世界最大银行的前10位大都是日本银行。经过两行合并，日本又将出现一家资产额居世界第二位的大银行。这无疑给欧美金融界造成相当大的压力。英国一家大银行不安地表示，日本金融界的这一新动向，“将使今后国际市场上日本银行争夺主导地位的竞争变得更加激化”。
