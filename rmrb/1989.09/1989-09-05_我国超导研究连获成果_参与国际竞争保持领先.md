In one of the most competitive fields of international science and technology today, Chinese scientists have continued to maintain a leading position in superconductivity research with their outstanding achievements. The Beijing International Conference on High-Temperature Superconductivity held today provides evidence that, with the continuous emergence of superconducting applications, humanity is approaching the threshold of the superconducting era.

Following the discovery of a 100K superconducting material by the Zhao Zhongxian group at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, almost simultaneously with American and Japanese scientists more than two years ago, which sparked a "superconductivity boom" worldwide, China's superconductivity research has made significant progress. Nearly 500 scientists from more than 4000 research and educational institutions across the country have achieved numerous results.

In the first half of this year, China University of Science and Technology first discovered a 132K zero-resistance temperature material in the bismuth-antimony system. This is currently the highest critical temperature record confirmed internationally. China has also conducted systematic and in-depth research on the crystal structure, properties, and effects of newly emerged bismuth and thallium systems.

At the same time, China has developed unique processing technologies for high-temperature superconducting materials, producing yttrium system materials with a critical current density higher than 11,000 amperes per square centimeter and yttrium system superconducting films with 1 million amperes per square centimeter. Using high-temperature superconducting materials, China has also developed instruments for geological exploration and biomagnetic measurements. In the physical properties and microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductors, Chinese researchers have also made good progress.

    我国超导研究连获成果  参与国际竞争保持领先
    本报北京9月5日讯　记者杨良化报道：在当今国际科技竞争最激烈的领域里，中国科技人员以自己接二连三的出色成果，继续保持超导研究的领先地位。今天在这里召开的北京高温超导体国际会议提供的情况表明，以不断出现的超导应用为标志，人类正在逼近超导时代的大门。
    继两年多前中科院物理所赵忠贤小组与美国、日本科学家几乎同时发现100K的超导材料，从而在世界上掀起了一股“超导热”之后，中国的超导研究又有了长足的进展。全国4000多个科研、教学单位的近500名科学工作者取得了不少成果。
    今年上半年，中国科技大学首先发现了零电阻温度132K的掺锑铋系材料。这是目前国际上已证实的临界温度的最高纪录。我国还对新出现的铋系、铊系材料的晶体结构、特性、效应等方面做了系统深入的研究。
    与此同时，我国还发展了有特色的高温超导材料的成材工艺，制备出临界电流密度高于11000安培／厘米2的钇系材料和100万安培／厘米2的钇系超导薄膜。应用高温超导材料，我国还制成了用于地质勘探和生物磁性测量的仪器。在高温超导体的物理特性、微观机理等方面，我国科研人员也做出了较好的成果。
