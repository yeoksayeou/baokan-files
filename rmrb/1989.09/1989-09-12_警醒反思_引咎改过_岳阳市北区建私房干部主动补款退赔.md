On July 28th, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Yueyang Municipal Committee and the Yueyang Municipal Government held a meeting on building an honest government and combating corruption. During the meeting, it was revealed that there were issues with private housing construction in the northern district of Yueyang. The 67 deputy section-level and above cadres who had built private houses were greatly shaken in their thoughts. After serious reflection, without waiting for the district's housing clearance team to come to their doors, they wrote self-inspection reports, actively went to the district's housing clearance office to clarify the issues, and inquired about the amount of compensation. From August 1st to 3rd alone, 26 cadres in the district actively paid a total of 4,725.85 yuan in land occupation fees and fines. Currently, due to the active repayment and compensation by leading cadres, the housing clearance work in the entire district is proceeding smoothly.
