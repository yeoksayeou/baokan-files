Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 13th.

Albania and Czechoslovakia have decided to restore ambassadorial-level diplomatic relations, according to a report by Albanian Television on the evening of the 13th.

The two countries downgraded their diplomatic relations from ambassadorial to chargé d'affaires level in 1961.

Currently, Czechoslovakia is Albania's largest trading partner in Eastern Europe.

During the autumn session of the United Nations General Assembly last year, the foreign ministers of Albania and Czechoslovakia held their first meeting since the 1960s and discussed the issue of upgrading diplomatic relations.
