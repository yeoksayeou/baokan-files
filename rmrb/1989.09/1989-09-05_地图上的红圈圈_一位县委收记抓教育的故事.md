In the office of Fan Maozhi, the secretary of the Ying County Committee in Shanxi Province, there hangs a map of the county. On it, many small red circles are drawn with a red pencil. We were unaware of the mystery behind them, but upon inquiry, we learned that each circle represents a school he has visited. Out of the county's 300-plus schools, he has visited 245, which is why the map is covered with dense red circles.

As early as the autumn of 1984, Fan Maozhi went to Xiaowangzhuang for an inspection. He first visited the school and found that the school's mud wall was about to collapse, held up only by a few wooden stakes. The classrooms were low and small, with walls plastered with rough mud. Two stones with a wooden board on top served as desks, and the windows were covered with black cowhide paper. Meanwhile, the farmers' houses were built better and better. He sternly criticized the village cadres and ordered the village to install glass windows, plaster the walls with fine mud and whitewash them, and rebuild the collapsed wall.

Since then, he and the county education bureau officials have visited all the schools in the county with dilapidated buildings, checking and ensuring the repair of school buildings. The county quickly launched a campaign to raise funds for education. In a few months, 300 million yuan was raised, 120 new schools were built, and 80% of the schools achieved "one without, two with" (i.e., no dilapidated buildings, every class has a classroom, and every student has a desk and chair).

Every time he visits a school, Fan Maozhi inspects the teachers' lesson plans and homework correction, sometimes even listens to classes, and asks school leaders to report on their work. He even picks up a piece of chalk and teaches a few classes on revolutionary traditions to the students.

He requires the education leaders at the township (town) level and school principals to insist on listening to classes and checking lesson plans. He said, "Managing education means understanding education. If you go to a school and don't listen to classes, don't understand the teaching situation, how can you manage education well?" The new school built in Xijiafang Village covers an area of more than 50 acres, and the enthusiasm of the people for education is high, but the teaching quality has not improved much. Fan Maozhi visited this school three times, discussing with the teachers the reform of teaching content, teaching time, teaching methods, and how to integrate ideological education into various subjects.

Now, this school ranks at the top in the county and township examinations.

"Be the confidant of teachers," Fan Maozhi often says.

The housing situation in the county seat of Ying County is very tense. The county committee leaders have discussed many times and have solved the housing foundation problem for 125 households of teachers in the county seat. He heard that some young teachers in Baima Shi Middle School were not willing to work in the mountainous area, so he specially went to this school and stayed overnight, talking to each of them and solving their ideological problems.

In recent years, Ying County's education work has achieved remarkable results:

In 1984, the county became a county with basic elimination of illiteracy.

In 1985, the county became a county with universal primary education in Shanxi Province and was named one of the "Ten Red Banners" in the province's adult education.

In 1988, among the 100 counties nationwide that were commended for eliminating illiteracy, Ying County was one of the four counties in Shanxi Province that were commended.

These certificates, banners, and books with bright red and gold covers are all linked to the red circles on Fan Maozhi's map. What kind of internal connection do they have? What kind of enlightenment do they have for local leaders in charge of education work?

    地图上的红圈圈
    ——一位县委收记抓教育的故事
    杨甫  进纲  炳炎
    山西省应县县委书记樊茂枝的办公室里，挂着一张县地图，上面用红铅笔画着许多小圆圈。我们不知其中的奥秘，打听后才知道，原来每画一个小圆圈，就意味着他又去了一所学校，全县300余所学校、他已经跑了245所，怪不得地图上的圈圈画得密密麻麻。
    早在1984年秋天，樊茂枝到小王庄下乡，首先来到学校，发现学校的土围墙快倒塌了，只用几个木桩顶着，教室又矮又小，墙上仅抹了一层粗泥，两块石头上放一块木板当课桌，窗子上糊着黑乎乎的牛皮纸……而农民的房子一家比一家盖得好。他严厉地批评了村干部，让村里限期给窗子装上玻璃，给墙壁上抹上细泥、涂上白粉，把围墙推倒重建。
    从这之后，他和县教育局的同志跑遍了全县所有有危房的学校，检查落实维修校舍的情况。全县迅速掀起了集资办学的热潮，几个月时间，集资300余万元，新建学校120所、80％的学校实现了“一无两有”（即学校无危房，班班有教室，人人有桌椅）。
    每到一校，樊茂枝都要查看教师的教案及作业批改情况，有时还要听课，要学校领导汇报工作，甚至拿起粉笔给学生上一两节革命传统课。
    他要求乡（镇）分管教育的领导和校长要坚持听课、查教案。他说：“管教育就必须懂教育，你到学校连课都不听，不了解教学情况，怎么能把教育管好？”席家堡村建起一座占地50余亩的新学校，群众办学积极性很高，但教学质量提高得不快，樊书记三次来到这所学校，和教师们一起探讨教学内容、教学时间、教学方法的改革及怎样把思想教育渗透到各科教学中去。
    现在，这所学校在县乡统考中已名列前茅。
      “做教师的知心人”，樊茂枝常这样说。
    应县县城住房十分紧张，县委领导多次商议，为县城125户教师优先解决了住房地基。他听到白马石乡中学一些年轻教师不安心在山区工作，便专程去这个学校呆了一夜，逐个谈心，解决他们的思想问题……
    近年来，应县教育工作取得了可喜成绩：
    1984年，该县成为基本扫除文盲县。
    1985年，该县成为山西省普及初等教育合格县，并被命名为全省成人教育“十面红旗”之一。
    1988年，在全国受表彰的100个扫除文盲县中，应县是山西省受表彰的4个县之一。
    这一张张奖状、一面面奖旗和一本本鲜红烫金的证书，与樊茂枝地图上的那些圈圈有着什么内在的联系呢？这种联系对各地主管教育工作的领导同志又有什么启发呢？
