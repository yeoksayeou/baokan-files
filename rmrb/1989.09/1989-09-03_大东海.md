In the southeast of Sanya City, Hainan Province, there is a crescent-shaped bay with thousands of acres of clear waters, attracting hundreds of thousands of domestic and international tourists. This is Dazhonghai, which can be compared to the beaches of Hawaii in the United States.

Dazhonghai is one of the eight famous scenic spots in Sanya City. The sea here is calm and clear, the beach is flat and comfortable, the sand is smooth and soft, the sunlight is bright and warm, and the scenery is beautiful and enchanting, making it the best place to "export sunshine and beaches to the world."

The climate here is excellent, with over 300 sunny days a year, making it a swimming season all year round. Sea bathing, sunbathing, and sand bathing allow tourists to enjoy themselves freely and reap great benefits.

Walking along the beach towards Yulin Port, not far ahead is a small hill. Climbing the steps, there is a pavilion on top of the hill, which is where tourists go to enjoy the sea view. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, one can see palm trees, pavilions, masts, and rock shadows, all in a picturesque and charming arrangement. Some are still, some are moving, some are near, and some are far. The water is clear and calm like a mirror, the waves are green and still, the surface of the water is blue, the sky is vast and endless, and the blue sky stretches for miles, allowing one to experience the beauty of "vast sea and sky." The slightly salty sea breeze gently brushes against the body, making one feel cool, gentle, and comfortable, with a sense of openness and tranquility.

    大东海
    刘建春
    海南省三亚市东南面，有一处半月形的海湾，千顷清波，吸引着成千上万的中外游客。这就是足以和美国夏威夷海滩相媲美的大东海。
    大东海是三亚市著名的八景之一。这里的海水平静清澈，海滩平整舒适，海沙光洁细软，阳光灿烂和煦，风景绮丽迷人，是“向世界出口阳光和海滩”的最佳地方。
    此处气候优越，年晴日在三百天以上，全年都是游泳季节。海水浴、日光浴、沙浴，令游人恣意畅怀，受福不浅。
    沿着海滩向榆林港方向走，不远处是一个小山包，拾级而上，山顶上有个望海亭，这是游人登山望海的所在。凭栏远眺，但见椰树、亭阁、樯帆、岩影，绰约参差，或静或动，若即若离。水清平如镜，波心凝碧，水面拖蓝，巷穹无极，碧空万里，令人领略到“海阔天空”的神韵。略带咸涩的海风轻拂全身使人感到清凉、温柔、适意，心旷神怡。
