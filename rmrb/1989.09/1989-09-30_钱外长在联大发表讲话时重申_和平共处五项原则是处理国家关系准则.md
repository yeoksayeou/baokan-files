Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today reiterated in his speech at the UN General Assembly that the guidelines for handling state relations should be the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He emphasized that resolving the difficulties in relations between some Western countries and China must adhere to these principles, and establishing a new international political and economic order should also be based on these principles.

Qian, who is the head of the Chinese delegation to the 44th UN General Assembly, said in his speech that China has consistently been committed to establishing and developing friendly cooperative relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Over the past year, China's relations with many countries, especially with neighboring countries, have further improved and strengthened. In May of this year, China and the Soviet Union normalized their relations and agreed to develop mutual relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

He said that China's relations with Western countries had also been developing steadily. However, in the past few months, China's relations with some Western countries have encountered varying degrees of difficulties. In late spring and early summer, Beijing experienced a turmoil aimed at overthrowing the Chinese government and the socialist system. It goes without saying that handling this issue is China's internal affair. The vast majority of countries in the world have expressed understanding towards the Chinese government's actions. Only a few Western governments, ignoring the facts, based on some distorted reports and erroneous intelligence, to varying degrees, have unjustly criticized and pressured the Chinese government. It should also be pointed out that there is ample evidence that some hostile foreign forces were involved in this incident, playing a role in inciting and exacerbating the situation. Foreign interference in China's affairs and interference in China's internal affairs are in violation of international norms and the basic principles of the UN Charter. The Chinese government, in order to safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity, naturally and resolutely rejects such interference.

Qian said that in the past few days, representatives from a few Western countries have continued to attack the Chinese government in their speeches at the UN General Assembly without any justification. They talk about "democracy" and "freedom," but in international relations, they are accustomed to dictating to others and imposing their will on others. This practice is against the tide of history and regrettable.

He said that normal state relations can only be established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China adheres to these principles. As long as other countries also adhere to these principles, normal relations with China can be established and developed. The way to resolve the difficulties in relations between some Western countries and China lies here.

In discussing the establishment of a new international political order, Qian said that in international relations, hegemony and power politics still exist. Bullying the weak with strength, imposing one's will on others, and even using force to invade other countries' sovereignty and destroy their territorial integrity still occur from time to time. At the same time, in international exchanges, there is a clear attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries using various means, which is a violation of basic international norms.

He said that there are so many countries in the world, and their social systems, ideologies, values, historical backgrounds, cultural traditions, and religious beliefs are so different from each other. Yet, their interests determine that they need to interact with each other. This requires all countries to take a realistic attitude, acknowledge the diversity of the world, not interfere in each other's internal affairs, and adhere to internationally accepted norms in exchanges. Only then can countries live in harmony, cooperate with each other, learn from each other, and prosper together.

Qian also pointed out that establishing a new international economic order should also follow the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Economic exchanges between countries should promote friendly cooperation among countries and should not be a means of exerting pressure and interfering in internal affairs. Attempting to impose a specific economic system and development model on others, interfering in the economic policies and development efforts of developing countries, is economic hegemony.

Qian also discussed regional conflict issues and disarmament issues, reaffirming China's consistent stance on these matters.

### 钱外长在联大发表讲话时重申  和平共处五项原则是处理国家关系准则

    钱外长在联大发表讲话时重申
    和平共处五项原则是处理国家关系准则
    据新华社联合国9月29日电　外交部长钱其琛今天在联大全体会议上发表中国对外政策讲话时重申，处理国家关系的准则应是和平共处五项原则，解决西方一些国家目前同中国关系中出现的困难必须遵循这些原则，建立国际政治和经济新秩序也应以这些原则为基础。
    钱外长是中国出席第44届联大代表团团长。他在讲话中说，中国一贯致力于在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则的基础上，同各国建立和发展友好合作关系。在过去一年里，中国同许多国家，特别是同周围邻国的关系，有了进一步的改善和加强。今年5月，中苏两国实现了关系正常化，并一致同意在和平共处五项原则基础上发展相互关系。
    他说，中国同西方国家的关系，本来也都在稳步地发展。但是在过去几个月里，中国同某些西方国家的关系中不同程度地出现了困难。今年春末夏初，北京发生了一场以颠覆中国政府、推翻社会主义制度为目的的动乱。不言而喻，处理这个问题是中国的内政。对于中国政府的这一举动，世界上绝大多数国家都表示理解。只有某些西方国家的政府不顾事实，单凭一些歪曲的报道和错误的情报，程度不同地对中国政府横加指责，施加压力。还应当指出，有许多事实证明一些外国敌对势力卷入了这次事件，起了推波助澜的作用。外国插手中国的事件，干涉中国的内政，这是违背国际关系准则和联合国宪章基本原则的，中国政府从维护国家主权和民族尊严出发，理所当然地坚决予以拒绝。
    钱外长说，在过去几天里，有几个西方国家的代表在联大发言中，继续对中国政府进行毫无道理的攻击。口口声声讲“民主”，讲“自由”，可是在国与国的关系上却惯于对别人指手划脚、强加于人这种做法正是逆历史的潮流而动，不能不令人遗憾。
    他说，正常的国家关系只能建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上。中国是信守这些原则的。只要别的国家也信守这些原则，同中国的正常关系就可以建立和发展。解决一些西方国家目前同中国的关系中出现的困难，其出路也在这里。钱外长在谈到建立国际政治新秩序时说，在国际关系中，霸权主义和强权政治还存在。以大欺小，以强凌弱，把自己的意志强加于人，甚至以武力侵犯别国主权、破坏别国领土完整的现象，依然时有发生。与此同时，在国际交往中还可以明显地看到利用各种手段干涉别国内部事务的企图，这是违背起码的国际关系准则的。
    他说，世界上有这么多国家，各国的社会制度、意识形态、价值观念、历史背景、文化传统、宗教信仰又如此互不相同，而它们的利益又决定了需要互相交往。这就要求各国采取现实的态度，承认世界的多样性，在内政上互不干涉，在交往中遵循彼此都能接受的国际关系准则，这样各国才能和睦相处，相互合作，取长补短，共同繁荣。
    钱外长还指出，建立国际经济新秩序，同样应该遵循和平共处五项原则。国与国之间的经济交往应该促进各国的友好合作，而不应该成为施加压力和干涉内政的手段。企图把某种特定的经济制度和发展模式强加于人，干涉发展中国家的经济政策和发展努力，是经济上的强权主义。
    钱外长还谈到地区冲突问题以及裁军问题，并重申了中国政府在这些问题上的一贯立场。
