**From Yumen to Daqing**

**—“Old Oil” Jiao Liren Discusses the Development of China's Petroleum Industry**

**Reporter Zhang Heping**

**Joining the Ranks of the World's Major Oil-Producing Countries**

Flipping through the "Statistics of the Petroleum Industry Over 40 Years," Jiao Liren told the reporter that the development of the petroleum industry in various countries, in terms of annual production, saw the United States produce 300 tons of oil in 1859, rising to 100 million tons by 1923, taking 64 years. The Soviet Union produced approximately 10,000 tons in 1860, rising to 100 million tons by 1958, taking 98 years. In 1949, China produced only 120,000 tons of oil. After 29 years of struggle, production reached 100 million tons in 1978, entering the ranks of the world's major oil-producing countries.

As the editor of "Contemporary China's Petroleum Industry," Jiao Liren likes to let numbers "speak." As one of the pioneers of China's petroleum industry, he is also a writer and witness of this history.

In late September 1949, after the liberation of Yumen, Jiao Liren was sent to Yumen Oilfield as the deputy military representative. At that time, Kang Shien was the military representative. From then on, Jiao Liren became closely associated with the petroleum industry. He told the reporter that the foundation of China's petroleum industry was very weak at its inception, with an annual production of 120,000 tons of crude oil, placing it at the bottom of the list of oil-producing countries, far from being commensurate with a country of several hundred million people. Today, China has developed from an "oil-poor" country into a major oil-producing country, with annual production ranking fifth in the world.

Jiao Liren said: From the perspective of the petroleum industry's benefits, by the end of 1986, the state had invested a cumulative total of 5.26 billion yuan in the petroleum industry. During the same period, the petroleum industry contributed 12 billion yuan to the state's finances, which is 228% of the total investment. Oil has become one of the main foreign exchange earners for the country. By the end of 1987, a cumulative total of 289 million tons of crude oil had been exported, earning 4.567 billion US dollars.

The development of the petroleum industry has brought about good social benefits:

First, it has supported the transportation industry. Railway transportation has basically achieved dieselization; in road transportation, the total length of high-grade and sub-high-grade asphalt roads nationwide has reached over 200,000 kilometers; the total number of civilian vehicles nationwide has reached 3.6195 million.

Second, it has driven the rapid development of the fertilizer and chemical fiber industries. In 1986, the national production of synthetic ammonia using oil and gas as raw materials reached 6.25 million tons; the production of chemical fibers by the Petrochemical Corporation using oil and gas as raw materials was 88,000 tons.

Third, it has expanded employment opportunities. China has 1.2 million petroleum workers, and it is estimated that one person can indirectly support the employment of 80 people.

**New China Brings New Hope to the Petroleum Industry**

Reflecting on the development of China's petroleum industry, Jiao Liren said with deep emotion:

"In the old China, intellectuals, geologists, and those who were determined to develop the country's petroleum resources, rode camels, endured hardships, and braved the vast deserts to drill for oil. At that time, the working, living, and technical conditions were much more difficult than they are today. They made some discoveries in Taiwan, Yanchang, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yumen, and other places. However, due to government corruption and constant turmoil, whether it was the Qing government, the Beiyang warlords, or the Kuomintang rule, China's petroleum industry was always subject to double oppression and suppression by foreign imperialism and domestic feudal forces, resulting in poor management and slow progress."

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the birth of New China opened a new chapter in China's petroleum industry. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries devoted a lot of effort. As early as 1953, when consulting with the Minister of Geology, Li Siguang, Chairman Mao said: "To carry out construction, oil is indispensable. Everything that flies in the sky and runs on the ground cannot move without oil." The first Five-Year Plan clearly stated: "The petroleum industry in our country is particularly backward, ... therefore, we must vigorously prospect for natural petroleum resources; ... make long-term and active efforts to develop the petroleum industry." In July 1955, the state established the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and from then on, large-scale petroleum industry construction began on China's vast land.

Jiao Liren told the reporter, "We successively discovered relatively large oil and gas fields in Kelamayi, Qaidam Basin, Sichuan Basin, and other places. Among them, the discovery of the Kelamayi Oilfield was the first breakthrough in oil exploration after the founding of New China. It is also the first relatively large oilfield developed and built in New China."

In 1960, the national annual crude oil production increased to 5 million tons, mainly from the northwest. This figure brought both joy and sorrow. From 120,000 tons to 5 million tons, in more than a decade, production increased by tens of times, but 5 million tons of crude oil for a country of several hundred million people was indeed a drop in the bucket!

**The Major Breakthrough of the Daqing Oilfield**

"China's petroleum industry made a historic breakthrough with the discovery of the Daqing Oilfield!" As a participant and commander of this major battle, Jiao Liren recalls this stirring and inspiring period with excitement.

The discovery of Daqing is due to the strategic eastward shift of oil exploration. In the first half of the 1950s, geologists such as Li Siguang made many statements about the sedimentary basins in eastern China, advocating the early start of oil exploration work. Starting from 1955, the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry successively began exploration in the North China Plain and the Songliao Basin. After a few years of work, they had an initial understanding of the oil-bearing prospects in eastern China. In February 1958, Deng Xiaoping, then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, clearly pointed out when listening to the report of Yu Qiu-li, the newly appointed Minister of the Petroleum Industry, and others: "Oil exploration work should be considered from a strategic perspective. We must choose a direction to focus on, and not have all fingers of equal length." He also proposed to pay attention to the exploration of the Songliao, North China, and East China regions and strive to find oil in the eastern region.

On September 26 of the following year, the Song-26 well in Daqing obtained industrial oil flow, thus opening the curtain on this magnificent Daqing oil battle.

The discovery of Daqing marked a historic turning point in the petroleum industry. Going to Daqing and fighting in the east was the correct decision! In 1960, under the leadership of Yu Qiu-li, Kang Shien, and others, the petroleum industry concentrated its main manpower and resources, with the support of the entire nation, to launch a magnificent Daqing oil exploration and development battle. In just over three years, a large oilfield was discovered, with an annual production of 6 million tons of crude oil.

At the end of 1963, Premier Zhou Enlai solemnly declared at the fourth session of the Second National People's Congress: "China has achieved basic self-sufficiency in oil." The era of relying on foreign oil has passed! The land of China was filled with joy.

In the late 1960s, China successively launched oil battles in Shengli, Dagang, Liaohai, Jianghan, Nanyang, North China, Zhongyuan, Sichuan, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia basins, further developing the petroleum industry...

**Hope and Difficulty Coexist**

Since the reform and opening up, the vitality of petroleum enterprises has been further enhanced, and the petroleum industry has entered a new period of development.

"According to China's medium-term energy industry development plan, by the year 2000, the annual crude oil production will be 200 million tons, and natural gas will be 30 billion cubic meters." Jiao Liren again cited figures and calculated a detailed account: "This means that at least 13.5 billion tons of geological reserves need to be secured, and from now on, an average of more than 10 billion tons of reserves need to be found each year, and more than 300 million tons of crude oil need to be increased each year, with an additional workload of more than 20 million tons each year, requiring a large amount of investment. Because many oilfields have entered the mid-to-late stages, natural decline is accelerating."

The task is glorious but arduous. Looking at the current situation of the petroleum industry, hope and difficulty coexist. The growth rate of reserves is lower than the growth rate of production, and funds are severely lacking... In recent years, the achievements made in the exploration, development, and construction of crude oil and natural gas in China have been made in the face of severe financial shortages, complex internal and external environments, and numerous difficulties. Millions of petroleum workers have silently endured difficulties and pressures that are unknown and difficult to bear for ordinary people, producing more each year and making more contributions each year.

Jiao Liren firmly believes that over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, relying on the superiority of the socialist system, China's petroleum industry has explored a path of self-reliance, hard work, and independent development.

Although there are difficulties and hardships in the future of the petroleum industry, the prospects are bright.

    从玉门到大庆
    ——“老石油”焦力人谈新中国石油发展
    本报记者  张何平
              跻身于世界产油大国
    翻开《石油工业40年统计资料》，焦力人告诉记者，世界各国石油工业的发展，从年产量来说，美国1859年产油300吨，1923年上升到1亿吨，用了64年；苏联1860年产油约计1万吨，1958年上升到1亿吨，用了98年；我国1949年产油才12万吨，经过历时29年的奋斗，在1978年产量上升到了1亿吨，跨入世界产油大国的行列。
    作为《当代中国的石油工业》主编，焦力人喜欢让数字“说话”。作为新中国石油工业的开拓者之一，他又是这一历史的书写者和见证人。
    1949年9月底，玉门解放后，焦力人被派往玉门油矿任副总军代表。当时，康世恩为总军代表。从这时起，焦力人就与石油结下不解之缘。他告诉记者，新中国石油工业起步基础十分薄弱，年产原油12万吨，在产油国的序列中只能忝陪末座，与几亿人口的大国极不相称。如今，中国已从一个“贫油国”发展成为产油大国，年产量跃居世界第五位。
    焦力人说：从石油工业的效益看，到1986年底，国家向石油工业投资累计526亿元，同期石油工业向国家财政上缴1200亿元，为投资总额的228％。石油已成为国家出口创汇的主要产品之一。到1987年底，累计出口原油2.89亿吨，创汇456.7亿美元。
    石油工业的发展带来良好的社会效益：
    一是支援了交通运输业。铁路运输已基本实现内燃机车化；公路运输方面，全国高级及次高级沥青路面达20多万公里；全国民用汽车拥有量达361.95万辆。
    二是带动了化肥和化纤工业的高速发展。1986年，全国以油气为原料的合成氨产量已达625万吨；石化总公司以油气为原料的化纤产量为8.8万吨。
    三是扩大了就业面。我国石油职工有120万人，预计1人可间接带动80人就业。
            新中国带给石油工业新希望
    焦力人回溯中国石油工业发展历程时，感慨万分地说：
    “旧中国知识分子，那些地质家和矢志开发祖国石油资源的仁人志士，骑着骆驼，风餐露宿，历尽艰辛，在茫茫戈壁沙漠打井找油。那时的工作、生活和技术条件比今天艰苦得多。他们先后在台湾、延长、新疆、四川、玉门等地有一些发现。但是，由于政府腐败，动乱不止，无论是清政府，还是北洋军阀、国民党统治时期，中国石油工业始终受到外国帝国主义和国内封建势力的双重阻挠和压制，渗淡经营，步履维艰。”
    中国人民革命的胜利和新中国的诞生揭开了中国石油工业的新篇章，毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德等老一辈无产阶级革命家倾注了不少心血。早在1953年，在征询地质部部长李四光的意见时，毛主席说：“要进行建设，石油是不可缺少的，天上飞的，地上跑的，没有石油都转不动。”第一个5年计划明确指出：“石油工业在我国特别落后，……因此，要求我们大力地勘察天然石油的资源；……长期地积极地努力发展石油工业。”1955年7月，国家成立石油工业部，从此，在中国广袤的土地上，开始了前所未有的大规模的石油工业建设。
    焦力人告诉记者，“我们在克拉玛依、柴达木盆地、四川盆地等相继发现较大油、气田，其中，克拉玛依油田的发现是新中国成立后石油勘探上的第一个突破。它也是新中国开发建设的第一个较大的油田。”
    1960年全国原油年产提高到500万吨，主要产自西北。这个数字令人喜忧交加。从12万吨到500万吨，10余年中产量提高了几十倍，然而，500万吨原油对于几亿人口的大国，实在只是杯水车薪！
            大庆油田的重大突破
      “中国石油工业历史性的突破是发现了大庆油田！”作为这一重大战役的参加者和指挥员之一，焦力人以昂奋的心情回忆这段振人心、扬国威的峥嵘岁月。
    大庆的发现归功于石油勘探部署的战略东移。50年代上半期，李四光等地质学家曾对我国东部地区的沉积盆地，作过不少论述，主张尽快展开石油勘探工作。从1955年起，地质部和石油部先后在华北平原和松辽盆地开始了勘探。经过几年的工作，对我国东部地区含油前景有了初步的认识。1958年2月，中共中央总书记邓小平在听取刚刚走马上任的石油工业部部长余秋里等人的汇报时，明确指出：石油勘探工作应从战略方面来考虑问题。要选择突击方向，不要十个指头一样长。他还提出要重视松辽、华北、华东等地区的勘探，争取在东部地区找出油来。
    翌年9月26日，在大庆松基三井获得工业油流，从而揭开了这场气势磅礴的大庆石油会战的序幕。
    大庆的发现是石油工业的历史性转变。上大庆，战东部，决策正确！1960年，在余秋里、康世恩等同志的领导下，石油工业集中主要人力物力，在全国人民的支援下，开展波澜壮阔的大庆石油勘探开发会战，三年多探明了一个大油田，年产原油600万吨。
    1963年底，周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上庄严宣告：中国石油基本自给。靠洋油过日子的时代一去不复返！神州大地，一片欢腾。
    60年代后期，我国又陆续在胜利、大港、辽河、江汉、南阳、华北、中原、四川以及陕甘宁等盆地，展开石油会战，使石油工业获得更大发展……
                希望与困难并存
    改革、开放以来，石油企业的活力进一步增强。石油工业进入了一个新的发展时期。
      “按照我国能源工业中期发展计划，到2000年，原油年产2亿吨，天然气300亿立方米。”焦力人又举出数字，算了一笔细账：“这意味着至少要拿下135亿吨的地质储量，从现在起平均每年要找到10多亿吨的储量，每年要增产300多万吨的原油，每年新增2000多万吨的工作量，要投入大量资金。因为不少油田都进入中晚期，自然递减加快。”
    任务光荣，但又艰巨。纵观目前石油工业形势，希望与困难并存。储量增长速度低于产量增长速度，资金严重短缺……近年来，我国原油、天然气的勘探、开发和建设所取得的成就，就是在资金严重不足、内外部环境复杂、困难重重的逆境中取得的。百万石油职工默默忍受着一般人不知晓，也难以忍受的困难和压力，年年超产，年年多做贡献。
    焦力人坚信，40年来，中国石油工业在中国共产党的领导下，依靠社会主义制度的优越性，摸索出一条自力更生、艰苦奋斗、独立自主地发展石油工业的道路。
    今后石油工业虽然存在着艰难困苦，但前景是美好的。
