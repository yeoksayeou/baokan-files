South Korean sailor Kim Se-Jong recently defected to North Korea. Today, he held a press conference in Pyongyang to share his personal experiences with two different social systems.

The 24-year-old said at the press conference that after graduating from middle school, he became a sailor on foreign ships due to his family's poverty and inability to afford university. He visited dozens of countries and witnessed the realities of two different social systems, concluding that only socialism has hope.

He said that he worked on foreign ships for seven years but experienced discrimination from the shipowners. Despite doing the same work as foreigners every day, his income was only one-third of theirs.

In South Korea, social inequality is severe, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. People cannot enjoy the freedoms they deserve, and poor young people have no opportunity to study.

Since coming to the North, he has visited factories, schools, and cultural institutions and seen with his own eyes that under the socialist system, everyone has the opportunity to study and work. Young people are full of ideals and vigor, and they are confident about the future.

He stated that through his visits, he realized that the South's propaganda about the North is completely false and defamatory.

When asked about his future plans, Kim Se-Jong said his only hope is to go to university and study to contribute to the construction of socialism.

    南朝鲜船员金世钟谈感受
    只有社会主义才有希望
    新华社平壤9月5日电    （记者黎能清）不久前刚刚投奔到朝鲜北方的南朝鲜船员金世钟，今天在平壤举行记者招待会，谈亲身体验到的两种不同社会感受。
    这位24岁青年在记者招待会上说，他中学毕业后，因家庭贫穷没有上大学，当了外轮船员。他跑了几十个国家，目睹了两种社会制度的现实，感到只有社会主义才是有希望的。
    他说，他在外轮上工作了7年，所得到的却是船主的歧视。每天与外国人干同样的工作，而他的收入仅仅是外国人的1／3。
    在南朝鲜，社会的两级分化严重，富者越富，贫者越贫，人民不能享受应有的自由。贫穷的年轻人没有机会上学。
    来到北方后，他参观了工厂、学校和文化机关，亲眼看到北方同胞在社会主义制度下，人人都有机会上学，人人都有工作。青年人富有理想和朝气，对未来充满了信心。
    他表示通过参观，使他感到南方对北方的宣传完全是诽谤性的虚假宣传。
    当问到今后打算时，金世钟说，唯一的希望就是上大学学习，为社会主义建设作贡献。
