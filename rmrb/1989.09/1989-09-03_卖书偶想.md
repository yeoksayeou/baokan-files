Title: Reflections on Selling Books

I finally sold a batch of books as waste paper, at one jiao per kilogram. Among them, there were several new books that I hadn't even finished reading. Because they were so unoriginal and bland.

Currently, I am reading a collection of excerpts. An article titled "The Best Short Pieces" left me amazed. It was brilliant. Let me give an example: the American film "The Thirteen Victims of Dr. Dement" was screened in Austria, and the local "Express" published a review that said, "I am the fourteenth." Although it was only six characters long, it sharply criticized the film's poor quality.

After reading "The Best Short Pieces," I raised my head and let out a sigh of relief, thinking: if such a review were written by one of our authors and sent to our editorial department, it would likely be rejected. It's too short, what can it possibly say!

Clearly, the problem of works being empty but long lies not only with the authors but also with the editors. However, blaming just the authors and editors is not enough; there is also the issue of standards for evaluating writing.

The great Soviet mathematician Pontryagin once said after doing some publishing work: "The more carefully you write a book, the thinner it becomes, but the more labor you put into it. If you double your effort, the book can become half as thick, but the royalties you receive will also be halved." Shouldn't this system of evaluating writing by the number of characters be changed?

Moreover, when we award prizes or evaluate professional titles, longer works are considered better. A 3,000-character essay, if padded with filler, can be published as a 50,000-character piece, and its evaluation will improve accordingly. Why? Because it's long.

I really don't understand why, when we attend meetings or listen to reports, everyone is afraid of boring "marathons," but when it comes to evaluating writing, we place so much importance on length?

I am also a bookworm, still loving to read and buy books; but in recent years, I have often been tricked by some new books (which are actually printing waste) and sighed in frustration. I truly regret buying them! I have finally learned my lesson. Now, when I browse bookstores, I no longer do the foolish thing of looking at the cover, flipping through the table of contents and preface, and then reaching for my wallet.

Reform and rectification should also include improving literary style!

    卖书偶想
    王之兰
    我终于把一批书当废纸卖了，一角来钱一斤。其中，有好几册是新书，都没有读完。因为它的毫无新意，味同嚼蜡。
    眼下，我正在读一本文摘。一篇《短文之最》，令我拍案叫绝。妙极了。试举一例，美国影片《戴斯蒙医生的十三个牺牲者》在奥地利上映后，那里的《快报》发表过一篇评论，曰：‘我是第十四个’。虽然只六个字，却一针见血地抨击了该影片的低劣。
    读罢《短文之最》，我抬起头来轻轻地舒了一口气，同时想：这样的评论，要是出自我们的作者之手，送到我们刊物的编辑部去，十之八九会被枪毙的。太短了嘛，能说明什么问题！
    可见，作品空而长，责任不仅在作者，也在编者。然而，单怪作者和编者也不行，还有个衡文制度或标准问题要解决。
    苏联大数学家庞特里亚金在做过些出版工作后说：“你写书越精心，那么书也就越薄，但你付出的劳动也越多。心血多花一倍，书可以变薄一半，但得到的稿酬也将减少一半。”这种依字计酬的衡文制度不应当改吗？
    还有，我们评奖、评职称，作品也是以长为佳的。一篇三千字的论文，如果加上水分，用五万字把它发表出来，人们对它的评价也将随之提高。为什么？长嘛。
    我真不明白，开会、听报告，大家都怕空而乏味的“马拉松”，我们衡文为什么那样看重一个“长”字？
    我也算是一个书痴，至今爱读书爱买书；但近年来却常常被一些新书（实则印刷垃圾）捉弄得唉声叹气。我真后悔，为什么要买它！我总算学乖了。现在逛书店，再也不干那看看书皮、翻翻目录和序言便掏口袋的傻事了。
    治理、整顿，也该整整文风！
