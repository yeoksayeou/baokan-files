Haniya got married. Hundreds of relatives, local leaders, and school principals and teachers from all over the Altai grasslands came to celebrate and express their gratitude to Haniya's Kazakh father, Akram, a model of national unity in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Originally, Haniya was a Han girl named Tang Jin Hua. Before she turned one, she lost her mother. Her father, Tang Wanlin, took her to the Altai grasslands in Xinjiang to settle down. During the ten years of turmoil, her father, an old volunteer soldier, was imprisoned for speaking a few good words about Liu Shaoqi. The 3-year-old Jin Hua was then taken care of by the production brigade.

"Let us take care of the child!" Kazakh herdsmen Beken and his wife, Jaziri, took Jin Hua home. The couple fed her medicine and milk spoon by spoon and made her a new set of clothes. Beken told his wife, "We must raise Jin Hua as our own daughter. No matter how hard or tiring it is, we must raise her to adulthood." The couple decided not to let Jin Hua's young heart bear any scars, so they let her follow their son, Hani, and changed her name to Haniya.

Jin Hua and Hani played together, helped their parents with chores, and learned to speak fluent Kazakh. She grew up happily in this family.

However, misfortune struck again. In 1969, Beken fell ill with cancer and passed away. Before his death, he struggled to tell Jaziri, "We are one family with our Han brothers. You must raise Haniya well until she grows up!" The strong-willed Jaziri held back her tears and nodded, reassuring him. From then on, she took on the responsibility of raising two children.

Three years passed, and Hani and Haniya both started school. Through an introduction, Jaziri met Akram, who had also lost his wife. They planned to get married. Akram had two sons of his own. Jaziri was worried that Akram might not treat Haniya well, so before they got married, she expressed her concerns to him. Akram sincerely said, "In the future, the four children will not be divided into yours and mine, nor will they be divided by ethnicity. We must all fulfill our duties as parents." Thus, people from two ethnicities and three families, totaling six people, formed a new family.

Among the four children, Akram showered more paternal love on Haniya. He saved money to buy her new clothes and often picked her up and dropped her off at school. Later, Jaziri also passed away, and Akram, acting as both father and mother, took even better care of Haniya and the other three children.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Akram's economic situation improved. He often had people buy clothes, headscarves, skirts, and boots for Haniya in Urumqi, dressing her beautifully. Haniya was also very obedient. At school, she studied hard; at home, she eagerly helped with chores. She got along well with her brothers, better than siblings from the same mother.

In 1982, Tang Wanlin's case was rectified; Haniya also got into the Altai Regional Normal School. Akram joyfully invited Tang Wanlin to his home. Tang Wanlin looked at his daughter, who had grown as tall as he was, and was overwhelmed with emotion. The 13 years in prison, the only person he missed was his beloved daughter, Jin Hua! He never imagined that Jin Hua would be adopted and living so well!

Akram thought that Tang, being over 50, needed a daughter to take care of him, so he emotionally said, "Old Tang! Haniya is your daughter. Now that you're back, take her home with you!" Tang Wanlin was deeply moved and said to Akram, "Jin Hua was raised by you and is used to the Kazakh way of life. Let her stay with you. In the future, we are relatives, one family!"

"Wanlin brother!" Akram took Tang's hand and said excitedly, "Our two ethnicities, three families, and one Jin Hua have truly become one family. How wonderful!"

Haniya looked at the two elders and smiled happily.

Now, Haniya has graduated from normal school and is teaching biology in a boarding middle school. She married Adili, a Kazakh teacher from the same school.

The guests at the wedding all blessed the happy union of the couple and the golden flower blooming in the garden of nationalities in Xinjiang.

    金花和她的父亲
    一个感人的民族团结故事
    哈尼亚结婚了。几百名亲友、乡领导干部、学校校长老师，从阿勒泰草原的四面八方赶来祝贺，向哈尼亚的哈萨克族父亲、新疆维吾尔自治区民族团结模范阿克拉木表示感谢。
    哈尼亚原来是一位汉族姑娘，名叫唐金花。她不满周岁时便失去了母爱，父亲唐万林背着她来到新疆阿勒泰草原安家落户。十年动乱中，她的父亲——一位老志愿军战士，因为替刘少奇讲了几句好话竟被投进监狱。3岁的小金花，只好由生产队照看。
    “把孩子交给我们吧！”哈萨克族牧民别肯、加孜里汗夫妇把金花接回了家。老两口一勺勺地给金花喂药、喂奶，还给她做了一套新衣服。别肯对老伴说：“我们要把金花当亲生女儿一样，再苦再累，也要把她养大成人。”夫妻俩商定，为不使金花幼小心灵留下创伤，让她随自己的儿子哈尼，改名叫哈尼亚。
    金花和哈尼一块玩耍，一块帮爸妈干活，学会了一口流利的哈萨克语。她在这个家庭里幸福地成长。
    但不幸的事又发生了。1969年，别肯老爹患癌症被夺去了生命。临终前，他挣扎着对加孜里汗说：“我们和汉族兄弟是一家人，你千万要抚养好哈尼亚，直到她成人！”性格坚强的加孜里汗强忍着泪水，连连点头，让他放心。从此，她挑起了抚养两个孩子的重担。
    3年过去，哈尼和哈尼亚都上了小学。经人介绍，加孜里汗认识了已丧妻的阿克拉木，准备喜结良缘。阿克拉木身边也有两个儿子。加孜里汗怕阿克拉木对哈尼亚不好，在结合前特意向他讲了自己的顾虑。阿克拉木诚恳地说：“今后4个孩子，不要分你的我的，也不要分是哪个民族的，我们都要尽到做父母的责任。”就这样，来自两个民族、三个家庭的6口人，又组成了一个新家。
    在4个孩子中，阿克拉木把慈父的爱心更多地给了哈尼亚。他省下钱给她添置新衣裙，并经常接送她上学。后来，加孜里汗也去世了，阿克拉木既当爸，又当妈，更加细心地照料着哈尼亚等4个孩子。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，阿克拉木的经济逐渐宽裕了，他经常托人到乌鲁木齐给哈尼亚买衣服、头巾、裙子和靴鞋，把姑娘打扮得漂漂亮亮。哈尼亚也很听话。在学校，她刻苦用功；在家里，她争着干活。她和哥哥、弟弟们和睦相处，胜过一母所生的兄弟姐妹。
    1982年，唐万林的冤案平反了；哈尼亚也考上了阿勒泰地区师范学校。阿克拉木满怀喜悦地把唐万林接到家中。唐万林看着眼前长得跟自己一样高的女儿，不禁感慨万千。13年的冤狱，他牵肠挂肚的唯一亲人，就是爱女金花呀！他万万没有想到，金花会有人收养，而且生活得这样好！
    阿克拉木想，老唐50多岁，身边得有女儿照顾，于是动情地说：“老唐！哈尼亚是你的女儿，现在你回来了，就把她领回家吧！”唐万林激动异常，对阿克拉木说：“金花是你抚养大的，又习惯了哈萨克族的生活，还是让她继续留在你家里吧！今后我们是亲戚，是一家人！”
      “万林兄弟！”阿克拉木上前握住老唐的手，激动地说：“咱们两个民族，三个家庭，一朵金花，真正成为一家人多好啊！”
    金花望着两位老人，高兴地笑了。
    现在，哈尼亚已从师范学校毕业，在牧业寄宿制学校当了初中生物课教师，同本校哈萨克族青年教师阿迪力成婚。
    参加婚礼的人们都为这对恋人的幸福结合，为新疆各民族大花园里绽放的这朵金花深深祝福。
