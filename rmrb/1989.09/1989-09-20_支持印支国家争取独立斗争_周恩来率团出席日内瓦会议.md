In the early 1950s, while invading Korea, the United States intensified its interference in Indochina. This not only supported French colonialists in suppressing the people of Indochina but also posed a serious threat to China's southern border. While aiding Korea and fighting against U.S. aggression, China resolutely supported the people of Indochina in their struggle against colonial oppression and for national independence, providing Vietnam with substantial material aid and helping the Vietnamese people in their war against the French.

In early 1954, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France decided to hold the Geneva Conference in April to discuss the Korean and Indochina issues. The Chinese government appointed Zhou Enlai as the chief representative of the delegation to the Geneva Conference. This was the first time New China participated in an important international conference as one of the five major powers to discuss international issues. During the two-and-a-half-month conference, China, together with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, made active efforts to restore peace in Indochina. On July 21, the conference reached a series of agreements. The warring parties in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia signed ceasefire agreements. The French government issued a statement to withdraw troops from the three Indochina countries, respecting their independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The Geneva Conference achieved a ceasefire in Indochina, ending France's colonial war in the region that had lasted for many years, and thwarted the United States' plan to immediately intervene militarily in Indochina. This was a significant milestone in the struggle of the three Indochinese nations for independence.

This conference showed that the Chinese people, for the sake of their country's security, world peace, and the progress of humanity, made unremitting efforts to resolve international disputes through negotiations.

　　周恩来率团出席日内瓦会议
    50年代初，美国在入侵朝鲜的同时，加紧了对印度支那的干涉。这不仅是支持法国殖民主义者镇压印支人民，而且是对中国南部边陲的严重威胁。中国在抗美援朝的同时，坚决支持印支人民反对殖民奴役、争取民族独立的正义斗争，给予越南巨大的物质援助，帮助越南人民进行抗法战争。
    1954年初，苏、美、英、法四国外长会议决定4月举行日内瓦会议，讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题。中国政府任命周恩来为出席日内瓦会议代表团的首席代表，这是新中国首次以五大国之一的地位和身份参加讨论国际问题的重要会议。在为时两个半月的会议进程中，中国同越南民主共和国和苏联一起，为恢复印支和平作出了积极努力。7月21日，会议达成了一系列协议。越南、老挝和柬埔寨的交战双方分别签订了停战协定。法国政府发表声明从印支三国撤军，尊重三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。日内瓦会议实现了印支停战，结束了法国在这个地区进行多年的殖民战争，阻止了美国企图立即对印支进行直接武装干涉的计划，这是印支三国人民争取独立的重要里程碑。
    这次会议表明，中国人民为了祖国的安全、世界和平与人类进步事业，为通过谈判解决国际争端，作出了不懈的努力。
