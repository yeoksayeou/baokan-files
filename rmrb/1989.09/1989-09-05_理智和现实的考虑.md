At the all-member meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in London, a proposal to protest against the "Chinese suppression of peaceful protesters" was defeated. This incident shows that in the international community's judgment and evaluation of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots, rationality and realistic considerations are increasingly gaining the upper hand.

In the three months since the suppression of the riots, the Chinese government has presented a large amount of evidence, including numerous testimonies and physical evidence, exposing the crimes of a small number of people who plotted and instigated the turmoil behind the scenes and then launched the counter-revolutionary riots. With the truth becoming increasingly clear to the world, more and more countries have come to understand the true situation of this life-and-death struggle between revolution and counter-revolution that concerns China's destiny and future. Thus, people from various countries can make more objective and fair judgments on this matter. The defeat of this proposal at the London meeting is a reflection of the broad masses of parliamentarians from various countries no longer being deceived by certain segments of the Western media, but rather facing reality and making wise judgments after calm reflection.

In the past three months, international public opinion has increasingly pointed out that the suppression of counter-revolutionary riots is purely an internal affair of China, and no country has the right to interfere directly or indirectly under any pretext. This is a basic principle established by international law and a principle stipulated in the United Nations Declaration on Non-Intervention in Internal Affairs. The matter is as clear as black and white, but even today, some people, regardless of the fact that the truth has been revealed, continue to peddle the bankrupt myth, viciously attacking China, and attempting to continue to stir up anti-China waves. The defeat of the proposal put forward by the Federal Republic of Germany's parliamentary delegation in London is not an accident. This fully proves that their despicable actions are increasingly unpopular worldwide.

    理智和现实的考虑
    郑园园
    在伦敦召开的各国议会联盟全体会议上，一项所谓抗议“中国镇压和平抗议者”的议案被否决。这件事表明，在国际社会对中国平息反革命暴乱的判断和评价中，理智和现实的考虑已日益占据上风。
    平息暴乱三个月来，我国政府列举了大量事实，包括大量人证和物证，揭露了极少数人在幕后策划和挑起动乱，进而发动反革命暴乱的罪行，理直气壮地回击了西方舆论界中就此对我国进行的种种造谣诬蔑。随着真相日益大白于天下，越来越多的国家了解了这场关系到中国命运和前途的革命与反革命殊死搏斗的真情实况。这样，各国人士就能更加客观、公正地就此作出判断。伦敦会议上这项议案遭到否决，正是各国议会广大人士不再受某些西方舆论界的愚弄，而是面对现实，冷静思考之后作出明智判断的反映。
    三个月来，国际舆论日益广泛地指出：平息反革命暴乱纯属中国内政，任何国家无权以任何借口直接或间接地进行干涉，这是国际法的基本准则所确定的，也是联合国《不干涉内政宣言》所规定的原则。事情本来就是这样黑白分明，但时至今日，尚有一些人不顾事实已经廓清，真相已经大白，仍然一再鼓吹早已破产的神话，恶毒攻击中国，妄图继续掀起反华恶浪。联邦德国议会代表团在伦敦抛出的议案之被否决，并非偶然，这足以证明他们的卑劣做法已在世界范围越来越不得人心。
