A towering mountain stands tall, with steep cliffs and treacherous heights. A winding path snakes along the cliffs, taking 20 miles to reach the summit. Those who wish to cross this mountain must rest, bring provisions, and set out early in the morning. It is the "spine" of the Taihang Mountains, the watershed between Hebei and Shanxi, the famous Eighteen Bends!

Though the mountain is high and the path treacherous, for thousands of years it has been a major route to Shanxi. At the foot of the mountain lies the small, remote village of Xiaokou, under the jurisdiction of Ping Shan County. In the past, it was a place for porters and livestock drivers to rest; now, it is a hub for coal trucks, with hundreds passing through each day. The old narrow path has been transformed into a wide, smooth highway.

The village of Xiaokou has also changed. For generations, its people lived in this poor, desolate mountain valley, passing down a life of hardship. Even after 30 years of liberation, they were still considered a "third-class brigade." No one expected that, after another 10 years, the village would "rise to the heavens"! Let me tell you something: now, everyone in Xiaokou earns a wage, and the standard is mostly at the county or regimental level, with many earning over 300 yuan a month. They started paying wages to the entire village in 1984. Depending on the job, monthly wages range from over 300 yuan, over 200 yuan, to a minimum of 150 yuan. Even the elderly, weak, and disabled are given some work, like watching chickens or trees, and earn over 60 yuan a month. Everyone, except students, has a wage.

Why did such a dramatic change occur? Some say it was good timing, a lucky "climate," while others attribute it to the emergence of a farmer-entrepreneur, an outstanding leader...

This leader is Yan Huisheng, the old party secretary of Xiaokou Village. His ancestral home is Xibapo in Ping Shan County (where the Central Committee of the Communist Party once resided). Due to poverty, his great-grandfather left home and eventually settled in this remote mountain valley of Xiaokou. The place was even poorer, with nothing but rocks and a few acres of sandy slopes, which were barely enough to support the new settlers. Thus, they relied on the "route to Shanxi" to provide services to travelers crossing the Eighteen Bends, selling fried fruits for a living.

At the age of four, he lost his father, and his mother remarried. His grandfather was old, and his grandmother was blind, so he was raised by his aunt. At 15, he left his aunt's home to make his own way in the world.

Poverty and harsh conditions weighed heavily on the people of Xiaokou. Even after decades of liberation, they remained poor! A village of nearly 400 households had a total income of only 100,000 yuan in 1977. The following year, the old party secretary, Yan Huisheng, who was struggling to overcome poverty, suddenly saw an opportunity. Seizing the moment, he devised a plan: use the mountains to their advantage and develop the mines! He led the people of Xiaokou to exploit the mineral resources.

The largest source of income came from iron ore mining. Now, they mine 100,000 tons of ore and 50,000 tons of iron concentrate annually. Since 1983, they have begun to prosper, with total income growing from 100,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan. By 1988, it had reached 7 million yuan. In 1989, the year marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the annual output value is expected to reach 10 million yuan. In just over a decade, income has increased a thousandfold! They now have fixed assets of 4.4 million yuan, public accumulations of 5 million yuan, and an average per capita income of 1,640 yuan.

Yan Huisheng is of average height, slightly plump, with a bald head, and dressed like a typical farmer. Though he is 56 years old, he still has the energy of a young man, working day and night on his mining and industrial enterprises.

To support the development of the mines and the transportation of iron ore, they established three truck fleets, each with 30 large trucks. Running this transportation business should be profitable, but for some reason, it always incurred losses. Thus, this old party secretary and general manager of Xiaokou's mining and industrial enterprises took on the additional role of fleet manager.

Before dawn, he would arrive at the depot, assign tasks, and ensure all trucks were dispatched. In the evening, he would return to the depot, waiting for each truck to return. If a truck was delayed, he would wait until midnight, ensuring all were back before he had his dinner. Without any new tricks, the fleet's problems were solved, turning losses into profits, and even generating significant earnings. Therefore, everyone acknowledges him as the entrepreneur from this old mountain village, and the prefectural government named him a "farmer-entrepreneur."

Some say that with just a word from Yan Huisheng, he could earn tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. This is not without basis; he indeed has that ability, but he does not operate that way. He says he does not oppose others becoming wealthy, but he himself does not pursue personal wealth. If he did, he could have become a millionaire in a few years. He says, "Isn't it better to let the villagers all become wealthy?" Although the land is contracted to individual households, collective property has not been divided, nor have the mountains and forests. Income is still collectively accounted for and distributed. Irrigation, fertilization, water and electricity bills, agricultural taxes, procurement, and other expenses are all handled by the collective, while the grain harvested belongs to the individual households. Though the land is scarce (each person has only a few mu), the grain harvested is more than enough for self-sufficiency, and many households have over 10,000 jin in storage. At the founding of the nation, the yield was only 30-40 jin per mu, but now it averages over 1,590 jin per mu. Every household has savings, and millionaires are no longer rare.

Over the years, some people have found various ways to exploit relationships and purchase state-subsidized goods for resale, earning huge profits. Yan Huisheng does not need to seek such opportunities; his connections are numerous, but he has not earned a single yuan for himself.

Yan Huisheng manages 30 large trucks, as well as tool trucks and small cars, not to mention tractors. If he needs to transport something or plow a few mu of land, it is done without a word. Yet, he does not allow his fleet to handle personal matters. He and three other villagers jointly own a cow, each contributing a share, and it handles all plowing and transportation. Someone joked that he is a "one-leg-of-a-cow entrepreneur."

During the Spring Festival, a factory in Shanxi, a long-time friend, sent him a truckload of high-quality coal. The truck stopped at his door, ready to unload, but he came out and pointed north, then east. He meant to have the coal unloaded elsewhere. It turned out that place was the party branch and village committee's doorstep. He distributed the coal to everyone. Transporting it from Shanxi was not easy, crossing the Eighteen Bends, and he could not let them take it back.

Now that the villagers have money, the first important thing is to build new houses. Currently, everyone in Xiaokou has money, and though not everyone needs a new house, there are many who want a plot of land. The land for farming is scarce and cannot be occupied, but the plots for houses are few, and the demand is high, making it difficult to resolve the conflicts.

The old party secretary's daughter married within the village. The daughter and son-in-law indeed needed a new house and had found a good spot, which the villagers had already agreed upon and thought should be allocated to them. Yan Huisheng not only did not allocate this good plot to his daughter but also did not give her a secondary plot. Since the old party secretary did not allocate a plot to his own daughter, others did not dare to ask for one. The following year, after allocating the urgent plots, he finally gave his daughter a plot on a hillside. She spent 3,000 yuan to carve out a plot for her house from the hillside. Others said, "If the old party secretary's daughter can do this, we can too." Thus, the conflict was resolved.

This old party secretary has done many good deeds for the village over the decades, especially in the past 10 years, leading everyone to transform this poor mountain valley into a prosperous one, even surpassing the well-off villages on the vast plains. This is indeed not an easy task. Therefore, the old party secretary has high prestige in the village, and everyone acknowledges that he has made great contributions to the villagers, being the great pioneer of Xiaokou. Everyone respects him and follows his lead.

Someone has surveyed that the iron mine in Xiaokou can only be mined for 20 more years, and each year it becomes more difficult to extract. This old party secretary is pondering, "What will happen after 20 years? If it becomes more difficult to mine, income will decrease, and the villagers' income can only gradually increase. It cannot be that after becoming rich, we gradually become poor again."

He first led the villagers to build an "economic valley" in the southern mountain, planting it with fruit trees. In six or seven years, during the fruiting period, the annual income is expected to reach over 1.7 million yuan, which can exceed the current income from the ore processing plant. At the same time, he planted white poplar, Sichuan pepper, and pine trees in other areas...

Fortunately, a large mountain to the south of the village was found to be rich in silica ore, with reserves several times greater than the iron mine to the north. There are also reserves of jade, agate, lead, thorium, and gold. The mountain's belly is filled with treasures! Their business will continue to develop year by year, and their lives will improve step by step!

    矿脉
    阎　涛
    巍然耸立的一座大山，悬崖峭壁，高峻陡险。一条盘山道在崖壁间盘来绕去，攀上20里才能到达顶巅。要翻越这座大山的人，要打个尖，再带些吃喝，还要起个早儿才敢攀登。它是太行的“屋脊”，冀晋的分水岭，有名的十八盘！
    山虽高，路虽险，可千百年来却是条“跑山西”的大道。山下这个住宿打尖的深山小镇，是由河北平山管辖的下口村。早年，是挑八股索儿的与赶牲口的，爬这盘山道；如今，是拉煤的大卡车，哪天也攀上个百八十辆。原先的羊肠道，变成了宽敞的大公路。
    山脚下的这个下口村也变了。他们的祖祖辈辈生活在这个穷山恶水的深山老沟，一代传一代，过的都是苦日子。解放了30年，虽然强了一点儿，却仍然被称做“三类队”。谁也没想到，又过了10年，这个村子却“一步登天”了！先告诉你一件事：下口人现在人人都挣工资，而且工资标准大都在县团级以上，不少人的月工资是300多元。他们是从1984年起，开始给全村人发工资的。按不同工种，月工资分别为300多元、200多元，少的150元。老弱病残，多少安排一点工作，比如看个鸡、看个树的，每月也发60元以上。除了上学的学生，人人都有工资。
    为什么会突然发生了巨变呢？有人说是天时好，遇上了好“气候”，也有人说是因为这儿出了位农民企业家，有个出色的领头人……
    这个领头人就是下口村的老支书阎惠生。他的老家是平山西柏坡（住过党中央机关的地方），是他爷爷的爷爷，因为贫穷，离开老家，后来流落到这个深山老沟的下口。这地方更穷，除了石头还是石头，就那几亩山坡沙地，哪能有他这新来户的地种呢。于是就借着这条“跑山西”的“大道”，帮那些翻越十八盘的人打尖，炸油果为生。
    他四岁丧父，母改嫁，爷爷年迈，奶奶眼瞎，跟姑长大。15岁即离开姑家，自己闯天下。
    穷山恶水压着下口人，解放了几十年还是穷！一个近400户的村庄，一直到1977年全村的总收入才1万元。又过了一年，正苦于不能战胜穷山的老支书阎惠生，忽然遇上了天时，天时一到，计上心头：靠山吃山，发挥山的优势！他指挥下口人开发矿山。
    收入最大的是铁矿开采，现在年采矿石10万吨，铁矿精粉5万吨。从1983年起即开始变富，总收入由1万增长到60万元。到1988年，增长到700万。到了迎接国庆40周年的1989年，年产值可达1000万元。这十年多一点的时间，收入增长了1000倍！他们现有固定资产440万元，公共积累500万元，人均生活水平1640元。
    阎惠生个头不高，稍显发福，光葫芦脑袋，标准的农民打扮。虽已56岁，却仍如年轻人那样精力充沛，日夜在操劳着他的工矿企业。
    为了跟开发矿山、运送铁矿石相配套，他们建起3个30辆大卡车的汽车队。搞这个运输本该是赚钱，也不知为什么却总赔钱。于是，他这位老支书、下口工矿企业的总经理，兼起了汽车队的队长。
    天不亮他就来到车场，分派好任务，看着所有的车都开出去。傍晚，他又来到车场，看着一辆辆车返回来。如果有的车在路上耽搁了时间，他就在车场上等到深夜12点，都到齐了，他才回家吃晚饭。也没见他使什么新招，车队的问题解决了，同时也变亏为盈了，而且还盈利不少。
    不管是开矿、选矿，十几个工矿副业摊点，都装在他的心里，哪里有什么问题，他都一清二楚，现在怎么办，下步怎么办，指挥得头头是道。只要是他管的企业，那就保准兴旺发达，月月赚大钱。所以，人人都承认他是这老山沟里出来的企业家，地委行署命名他为“农民企业家”。
    有人说，只要阎惠生说一句话，就能赚回几万或几十万。这话是有根据的，他确实有这个能耐，只是他不这样搞。他说他不反对别人个人致富，但他自己不搞个人致富。要搞的话，这几年之内，很有可能已经成了百万富翁。他说，能让乡亲们都富起来不是更好么。耕地虽然分户承包管理了，集体财产没分，山林没分，收入仍然统一核算分配。庄稼的浇水、施肥，水电费，农业税，征购，户里都不用管，收的粮食却归自己。耕地虽少（每人只有四分多地），但打的粮食自足有余，不少户存粮超过万斤。建国初亩产三四十斤，现在平均亩产达到了1590多斤。家家都有存款，万元户早已不是稀奇事了。
    过来这些年，有些人寻找各种办法，利用各种关系，设法购买国家的平价物资，然后转手倒卖，赚大钱发了财。阎惠生不用寻找，他的关系多得很，但没为自己赚下一分钱。
    阎惠生管着30辆大卡，还有工具车和小车，拖拉机就不用提。他要拉运点什么，或者耕二亩地，不用他说话，捎带着也办了。可他设让他的车队为自家的事捎搭。他跟另外三户乡亲，合着养了一条牛，一家一条牛腿的股，耕种运输全办了。有人开玩笑说他是“一条牛腿的企业家”。
    过春节的时候，山西一个厂家，也是他多年交往的一个朋友，给他送来一卡车大块好煤，车停在他的门口，正要往下卸，他出来了。他对着司机往北一指，又向东一转。意思是：你们卸到这儿不好，给我卸到那儿吧。原来那儿是党支部、村委会的门口。他把这车好煤给大伙分了。从山西拉来不容易，要翻越十八盘，不能让人家再拉回去。
    农民有了钱，别的享受要不要都可，第一件重要事是盖新房。现在下口是家家都有了钱，不说家家要盖，反正要房基地的不少。耕地少不能占，可占的地基很少，要的人又很多，矛盾不好解决。
    阎惠生老书记的女儿嫁在本村，女儿女婿确实需要盖房，并已找到一块好地方，乡亲们也都认定是她家的了，并认为应该分给她。阎惠生不仅没分给女儿这块好房基，连次的也没给。老书记连自己的女儿都不分，别人也不好再争。到了第二年，把当紧要分的安排好以后，才给女儿分了块山坡，她花了3000元从这山坡上凿出一块房基地。别人说：“老书记的闺女都这么办，咱也这么办吧。”于是矛盾解决了。
    这位老支书几十年来为村里办了不少好事，尤其是这10年来，他和大家一起，能把这穷山沟变的富起来，甚至超过了大平原上条件好的那些富村庄，确实不是件容易事。所以，老支书在村里有着很高的威望，谁不说他为乡亲们立下了汗马功劳，是下口创业的大功臣。大家都尊重他，听他的指挥。
    有人勘察过，下口的铁矿山只能开采20年，而且一年比一年难采。这位老支书在琢磨，20年后怎么办？难采就要减少收入，乡亲们的收入只能逐步提高，总不能富了以后，又逐步降低，再一次变穷。
    他先带领村里人，在南山沟建起一条“经济沟”，栽上了满沟的果树。六、七年后到盛果期，预计年收入170多万元，可以超过现在选矿厂的收入。同时，还在另外的地方，种了满山满沟的白杨、花椒，飞播了松林……
    可喜的是，又发现了村南整个一座大山里面藏的都是硅矿，比村北铁矿的藏量要多几倍。并有玉石、玛瑙、铅、钍、金的储藏，大山的肚里装的都是宝呀。他们的事业要年年发展，他们的日子要步步登高！
