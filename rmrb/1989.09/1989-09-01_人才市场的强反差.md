On the morning of August 16, the Yunnan Science and Technology Palace was bustling with people. The 5-day Yunnan Talent Market Exchange Conference, which had been held for 5 days, was nearing its end. The market staff looked at the exchange results statistics table and felt a sense of relief: "8,055 people were received and exchanged, 721 intention agreements were reached, and 202 exchange procedures were completed."

At this moment, a teacher from the recommendation office of a certain key university was worried. They recommended 112 self-funded graduates to the talent market, but only 3 found jobs.

Not far from this school's recommendation office, a similar situation occurred at the recommendation office of a certain financial and commercial college: It is said that financial and accounting professionals are in short supply, but 26 self-funded graduates from this college entered the talent market to find employers, and at least 10 or more would have to temporarily become "unemployed youth."

Interestingly, between these two struggling recommendation points, a private college that was often looked down upon—Hunan Jiyushan College—was particularly busy. After 4 days of hustle and bustle like a market, on the 5th day, the 99 self-funded graduates of this college were all booked by employers. Before the conference ended, the teachers and students packed up their materials and returned triumphantly.

What caused such a stark contrast? The following scenes can give us some insight:

A recruitment officer from Kunming Steel Company approached the teacher of the financial and commercial college: "We need some financial and accounting talents. Can you help us?" The teacher replied, "We are very willing to support you, but unfortunately, the students do not want to go because it is too far." In fact, Kunming Steel is only about 30 kilometers from Kunming City.

A scientific and educational materials company and an electroplating factory also sought help from this college: "Our units are located in Kunming City, and we welcome graduates from your school to come and work." The teacher hurriedly called the students to discuss, but unexpectedly, they were met with a cold response: "These two units are in the city, but they are both collectively-owned enterprises. We won't go."

The recruitment officer from the Chuxiong City Government in Yunnan saw from the talent market recommendation materials that many students from the key university wanted to find jobs as secretaries, so they expressed, "We need a secretary."

But after consulting with the students, the teacher had to apologize to the guest: "These graduates do not intend to work as secretaries in a prefecture-level city."

One after another, personnel officers who rushed from remote areas to the talent market to recruit talents sighed as they held the talent recommendation forms: Hundreds of Yunnan graduates who came to the market to seek jobs had one thing in common—they wanted to work in Kunming City and were eager to engage in foreign trade, finance, secretarial, public relations, and editing work.

The recruiters then flocked to the recommendation office of the "non-official" Jiyushan College, and the 99 college students who were willing to work in the border areas were quickly snapped up.

"Which units have taken your students?" Curious people gathered around the teachers of Jiyushan College to inquire. The teacher smiled and announced the list of employers: Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture... "These are all underdeveloped areas. Do they really want to go?" Some people still didn't believe it. The teacher turned his gaze to a student: "You can ask him. This student is going to the most remote Red River County in Honghe Prefecture."

The young man named Zhao Yuhuai, a Chinese literature major, spoke confidently: "We are going to the poorest areas of Yunnan. We have been prepared for this. When we were in school, we filled out our wish: to work in the border areas!"

The onlookers sighed and admired, and then fell into a moment of silence.

The strong contrast in the job-seeking behavior of college graduates has given people much to think about and reflect on.

### 人才市场的强反差

    人才市场的强反差
    新华社记者　李承祖
    8月16日上午，云南省科技宫内人声鼎沸，举办了5天的云南人才市场交流大会已近尾声。市场工作人员看着交流成果统计表，心中掠过一丝慰藉之情：“接待交流人员8055人，达成意向性协议721人，办理交流手续202人。”
    此刻，大厅内某重点大学毕业生推荐处的老师却在犯愁。他们在人才市场推荐112名自费毕业生，仅有3名物色到工作单位。
    离这所学校推荐处不远的某财贸学院推荐处，也遇到了类似情况：都说财会专业人才供不应求，但这个学院的26名自费毕业生进入人才市场寻找主顾，却至少有10多人要暂时变成“待业青年”。
    有趣的是，就在这两个困难重重的推荐点间，一所被人看不起的民办院校——湖南九疑山学院的毕业生推荐处却格外忙碌。在如同赶集般热闹了4天后，第5天一大早，这个学院的99名自费生就被用人单位预定一空。不等大会结束，老师、学生就收拾起材料凯旋了。
    如此强烈的反差，到底是怎么回事？看看下面这组镜头，我们就可以略知一二了：
    昆明钢铁公司招干人员找到那所财贸学院的老师：“我们需要一些财会人才，能帮助解决吗？”答：“非常愿意支持你们，遗憾的是同学不愿去，嫌远了。”实际上，昆钢离昆明市区不过30来公里。
    一家科教器材公司和一家电镀厂也求助于这所学院：“我们的单位就在昆明市区，欢迎你校毕业生前来工作。”老师忙找来学生商量，想不到碰了一鼻子灰：
  “这两个单位虽在市区，但都是集体所有制单位，不去。”
    云南楚雄市政府的招干人员从人才市场推荐材料上得知，那所重点院校不少学生想求职当秘书，于是表示：“我们正需要一名秘书。”
    但老师征求意见后，不得不歉意地告诉来客：“这批毕业生无意到地州当秘书。”
    一个个从边远地区风风火火赶到人才市场招贤纳才的人事干部，手捧人才推荐表直叹息：前来市场求职的数百名云南籍大学生，大部分一个意思——要在昆明市工作，而且要求从事的全是外贸、金融、文秘、公关、编辑之类的工作。
    招贤者转而涌向“编外”院校九疑山学院的推荐处，把自愿到边疆工作的99个大学生一抢而空。
      “你们的学生都被些什么单位要走了？”好奇的人围住九疑山学院的老师打听。老师微笑着公布了用人单位名单：红河哈尼族彝族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州、文山壮族苗族自治州、大理白族自治州……“这都是落后地区呀，他们真的愿意去？”有人还不大相信。老师把眼光转向了一位学生：“可以问问他，这位同学就是准备分到最边远的红河州红河县的。”
    小伙子名叫赵玉怀，中文专业学生，讲起话来很自信：
  “我们要去的都是云南的贫困地区，这我们早有准备。在学校时，我们填报的志愿就是：到边疆工作！”
    围观的人感慨着、赞叹着，而后就陷入了一片沉默。
    大学生求职的强反差现象，给人们带来些什么思考和启示呢？
