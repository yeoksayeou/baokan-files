The annual task of collecting the personal income adjustment tax has been completed ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the State Taxation Administration, by the end of August, the nationwide collection of the personal income adjustment tax had reached 315 million yuan, completing the full-year plan of 300 million yuan four months ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, due to the strengthening of tax collection and management by tax authorities at all levels, the strict fulfillment of tax withholding obligations by paying units, and the voluntary tax declaration and payment by many taxpayers, the income from the personal income adjustment tax has continued to grow. The cumulative tax collection from January to August this year has increased by 3.88 times compared to the same period last year, reaching 2.75 times the total amount collected last year. Among these, the tax collection in August amounted to 79.24 million yuan, achieving the best result since the implementation of the personal income adjustment tax.

From a regional perspective, Liaoning Province collected 36.25 million yuan in taxes (including 12.09 million yuan from Dalian City), ranking first nationwide. Next is Guangdong Province, which collected 31.16 million yuan in taxes (including 16.27 million yuan from Shenzhen City). Hebei and Jiangsu provinces also collected over 200 million yuan in taxes.

    个人收入调节税全年任务已完成
    本报北京9月22日讯　据国家税务局统计，截至8月底，全国个人收入调节税已征收3.15亿元，提前4个月完成全年计划征收3亿元的任务。
    今年以来，由于各级税务部门加强征收管理，一些支付单位严格履行扣缴税款义务，不少纳税人自觉申报纳税，个人收入调节税收入持续增长。1至8月份累计征收税款，比去年同期增长3.88倍，是去年全年入库数额的2.75倍。其中8月份征收7924万元，创开征个人收入调节税以来最好成绩。
    从地区来看，辽宁省征收税款达3625万元（其中大连市1209万元），居全国第一，其次是广东省，征收税款3116万元（其中深圳市1627万元），河北、江苏征收税款也都超过2000万元。
