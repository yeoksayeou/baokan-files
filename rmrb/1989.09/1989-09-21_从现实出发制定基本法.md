In light of the series of events that occurred in mainland China in May and June, the Basic Law Consultative Committee had temporarily suspended all consultation work in Hong Kong. After the situation in mainland China stabilized, the committee's executive committee announced on July 20 that consultation work would fully resume. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided that the date for promulgating the Basic Law would remain unchanged, but the consultation period originally set to end on June 30 was extended by four months to the end of October.

According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law can be seen as the further implementation of the basic policies and guidelines that the central government will apply to Hong Kong after 1997. It provides a legal basis for the future development of Hong Kong in various aspects and also regulates the relationship between the central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In the future, many things will have to be carried out according to the provisions of the Basic Law or resolved through the procedures it establishes. A good Basic Law is undoubtedly the best guarantee for the implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy, a favorable factor for maintaining Hong Kong's social stability and prosperity, and the greatest assurance for Hong Kong people.

In the past few years of drafting the Basic Law, the Basic Law Consultative Committee has always played the role of a bridge between various sectors of Hong Kong society and the Basic Law Drafting Committee. The opinions of Hong Kong citizens have been valued by the Drafting Committee, which can be seen from the significant revisions made to the draft Basic Law after the first comprehensive consultation last year.

Recent events in Beijing have significantly changed Hong Kong's political climate, making it difficult for the Basic Law consultation work to proceed effectively. However, we believe that most Hong Kong people will face the future with an open and optimistic attitude. Currently, discussions on the Basic Law within Hong Kong society are gradually resuming. After the Beijing events, for various reasons, Hong Kong people have put forward many new views, and we are also pleased to see that some citizens who previously paid little attention to the Basic Law have begun to realize its importance and are catching up.

Currently, the committee's consultation work is being carried out in three areas:

(1) Redefining new consultation focuses, conducting internal discussions, and soliciting opinions from various groups;
(2) Regularly holding public seminars or lectures to discuss issues related to the Basic Law that Hong Kong people are concerned about;
(3) Planning to organize committee members and arrange for various groups to visit mainland China to exchange views with the drafting committee.

Since the full resumption of consultation work at the end of July, the six specialized subcommittees of the committee and their respective coordinating groups have held meetings to discuss future work. The committee has again discussed mutual coordination and work arrangements with the drafting committee and has conveyed Hong Kong people's concerns about the future to relevant parties. The committee hopes that during the remaining two months of the consultation period, Hong Kong citizens will participate more actively in discussions and express their opinions, creating a more harmonious atmosphere before the end of the consultation period. If the mainland drafting committee visits Hong Kong, the consultation work will be more effective.

In the past half-century, Hong Kong has experienced countless storms, both big and small, but has always managed to weather them and achieve greater development. Recently, some people have put forward new suggestions and ideas about Hong Kong's future direction, but I believe that starting from reality, "one country, two systems" is the only way forward for Hong Kong. Therefore, drafting a complete and good Basic Law for Hong Kong's future and laying a solid foundation for the implementation of "one country, two systems" is the top priority for every Hong Kong person at present.

### 从现实出发制定基本法

    从现实出发制定基本法
    香港基本法咨询委员会秘书长　梁振英
    鉴于中国内地五六月间发生的一连串事件，基本法咨询委员会曾经暂停所有在香港进行的咨询工作。及至内地局势稳定后，咨委会的执行委员会于7月20日宣布咨询工作全面恢复。人大常委会决定颁布基本法的日期不变，但咨委会原定在6月30日结束的咨询期则延长4个月至10月底。
    根据《中英联合声明》，基本法可说是1997年后中央对香港实施的基本方针政策的进一步落实。它为香港未来的各方面发展提供法理依据，而且也规范了中央和香港特别行政区的关系。将来有很多事情，我们都得按基本法的规定进行，或依循它定立的程序去解决问题。一部好的基本法无疑是“一国两制”政策能切实执行的最佳保证，是维持香港社会安定繁荣的有利因素，对香港人而言也是最大的保障。
    在过去几年的基本法草拟过程中，基本法咨询委员会一直担当着沟通香港社会各界人士与基本法起草委员会的桥梁的角色。香港市民的意见受到起草委员会的重视，这点是肯定的，而且也可以从去年第一次全面性咨询后草委会对基本法（草案）征求意见稿所作的大幅修改反映出来。
  近期的北京事件使香港的政治气候起了重大的变化，以致基本法咨询工作难以有效进行。但我们相信，大部分香港人都会以豁达、乐观的心情坚守岗位及面对未来。目前香港社会内已逐步恢复对基本法问题的讨论。北京事件后，由于种种原因，香港人提出了不少新的看法，同时，我们也很高兴见到，一些以前甚少关注基本法的市民开始觉察到基本法的重要，正跟进上来。
    现在咨委会的咨询工作分三方面开展：
    （1）厘定新的咨询重点，再进行会内讨论，并向各团体征询意见；
    （2）定期举行公开的专题研讨会或讲座，就港人所关心的基本法有关的问题展开讨论；
    （3）计划组织咨委和安排各界团体北上与内地草委交流意见。
    自从7月底咨询工作全面恢复后，咨委会的六个专责小组及其属下的统筹组已先后开会，研讨未来的工作。咨委会曾与草委会再次商谈相互配合及工作安排，并向有关方面反应港人对前途的忧虑。咨委会并希望在剩下的两个月咨询期间，香港市民能更积极参与讨论，发表意见，使咨询期结束之前出现比较和谐的气氛。届时如果内地草委访港，咨询工作就会更有成效。
    香港在以往半世纪的发展过程中，经历了无数大大小小风浪，但都能平安渡过，并取得更大的发展。最近，一些人士对香港的未来路向提出了新的建议和构想，但我认为，从现实出发，“一国两制”是香港前途问题的唯一出路，因此，为香港未来制定一套完整、良好的基本法，为“一国两制”的实施打下稳固的基础，正是每一个香港人当前首要的任务。
