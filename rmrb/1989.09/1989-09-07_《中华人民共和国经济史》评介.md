Professor Zhao Dexin's edited volume "Economic History of the People's Republic of China" (1949–1984) has been published by Henan People's Publishing House.

The book provides a comprehensive summary and in-depth analysis of the economic development of the People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1984. The authors argue that the new democratic economic model designed by the Communist Party of China before the founding of the nation is a great innovation that combines the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with China's national conditions. Under the new democratic economic system, where the socialist state-owned economy controls the economic lifelines and various economic components coexist, Chinese society was full of vitality, and production developed relatively quickly.

The book divides the post-founding period of national economic development into four phases. The first phase, from October 1949 to 1956, was a period of economic transformation and the transition from recovery to development. The second phase, from 1957 to 1966, was a period of comprehensive economic construction, during which the first exploration of the path for China's socialist economic construction took place. This period was marked by significant mistakes, leading to fluctuations in production and the need for major adjustments. The third phase, from 1967 to 1976, was a period of economic twists and deformities, characterized by significant losses due to the Cultural Revolution. The fourth phase, from 1977 to 1984, was a period of new paths and takeoff in economic construction, characterized by reform. Additionally, the book provides detailed discussions and scientific summaries of topics such as population development history, economic development history of ethnic minorities, and the theory of the primary stage of socialism, which are not covered in similar works.

The book extensively analyzes the interconnections between economic events and social, political structures, and influential viewpoints, particularly focusing on the mutual influence between the economic base and the superstructure. It analyzes the impact of economic thoughts, economic theories, economic policies, and political movements on economic development, revealing the ultimate causes of related political movements. The book systematically discusses and summarizes various aspects of the national economy, such as the economic environment, guiding ideology for economic work, economic policies, industrial economy, agricultural economy, fiscal finance, and commercial economy, by period.

    赵德馨教授主编的《中华人民共和国经济史》（一九四九—一九八四），已由河南人民出版社出版。
    该书对一九四九—一九八四年期间中华人民共和国经济的发展进行了全面的总结和深刻的分析。作者认为中国共产党在建国前夕设计的新民主主义经济模式，是把马列主义基本原理与中国国情相结合的伟大创举，在社会主义国营经济控制国家经济命脉、多种经济成分并存的新民主主义经济制度下，中国社会充满了活力，生产得到较快发展。
    该书将建国后国民经济发展过程，分为四个时期。即：一九四九年十月—一九五六年，经济形态转变和生产由恢复走向发展的时期。一九五七—一九六六年，全面进行经济建设的时期，也是第一次探索中国社会主义经济建设应该走什么道路，在探索中发生严重失误，引起生产大上大下，进行大调整的时期。一九六七—一九七六年，经济曲折、畸形发展的时期，特征是大批判带来大损失。一九七七—一九八四年，经济建设走上新道路和起飞时期，其特征是改革。此外，同类书中没有论及的人口发展史、少数民族经济发展史、社会主义初级阶段理论等内容，该书都给予了详细的论述和科学的概括。
    该书广泛地分析经济事件与社会、政治结构和具有影响的观点之间的相互联系，特别注意经济基础与上层建筑的相互作用，分析诸如领导人的经济思想、经济理论、经济政策、政治运动对经济发展的影响，揭示有关政治运动的终极原因。该书按时期对经济环境、经济工作指导思想、经济政策、工业经济、农业经济、财政金融、商业经济等国民经济各部门，分章进行论述，作了概括性的总结和分析。
