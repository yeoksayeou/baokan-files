Title: The Enduring Bond of Kinship

Summer is the season when the grasslands produce the most tofu. One day, I received a parcel from the White Sound Village in the Sand Lane of the Keshiketeng Banner, Inner Mongolia, where I had once worked during the "Down to the Countryside Movement." Inside was a piece of tofu that I hadn't tasted in years. The milk fragrance from thousands of miles away stirred my longing for the past.

I found myself, just like 15 years ago, boarding a westbound train, carrying strings of necklaces for the girls and bags of candy for the children, heading towards the grasslands, just like a distant worker returning home to visit family.

My return brought joy to the locals, and the grasslands brought me even greater joy. In the 10 years since I last saw it, the grasslands had become even more lush, the livestock even more prosperous, and life even more abundant. The hundreds of acres of land we had farmed in Sand Lane had been returned to pasture, covered in green grass and flowers; the horses we had longed for but rarely obtained had been replaced by brand-new motorcycles for the young men; the stacks of newspapers we could only receive every half month or longer had been replaced by televisions in the Mongolian yurts. Only the people remained as pure, as hospitable, as generous, and as kind as ever.

In 1974, we came from Dalian to work in the countryside here. It was our first time seeing the grasslands and sitting in a yurt with people who spoke a different language, eating hand-pulled meat, drinking milk wine, and singing Mongolian songs.

During the day, we learned Mongolian from them, and the young people in the village learned Mandarin from us. They learned much faster than we did. They were eager to learn and very intelligent.

The grasslands are far from Beijing but close to the border. The Mongols' robes served as clothing during the day and bedding at night. It was not until 1968, when the first batch of educated youth from Beijing and Chifeng arrived, that they began to use bedding universally, but they still used the ancient wooden-wheeled carts. The herders told us: "Things are much better now." We, however, still felt that things were backward. For example, the girls rarely washed their hair, allowing lice to roam freely. One day, when we rested, I boiled a large pot of water and washed their hair one by one. A few days later, they came to borrow basins, wanting to wash their own hair. I wished I could lend them all the basins I had.

In winter, we had no firewood and no dried cow dung to keep warm. The old mothers pulled our frostbitten hands, crying in sympathy. Then, they took us to their homes, treating us like their own children, boiling water for us to wash our faces in the morning and warming the kang for us at night. The winter on the grasslands is very long, and fuel is precious, but they burned twice as much firewood for us in a year. Looking at their faces, wrinkled by the passage of time, we thought of our own mothers.

We got along like a family. Although the grasslands were isolated, human relationships were very open, without so many feudal etiquette constraints. The unmarried girls sewed Mongolian boots for the male educated youth, piece by piece, like works of art, and the Mongolian young men took the female educated youth on horseback to see the herds far away.

Later, we gradually returned to the city. Every time someone left, the old mothers would send them off like family, with countless reminders and tears, sending them off again and again. On the day I left for college, the car had already started, but the old mother still had her son pass a piece of sheepskin through the window, telling me to put it on my bed so I wouldn't get cold. We left like this, with the affection of the hometown pulling at our hearts.

I came and went in a hurry. I hadn't seen enough of the changes in the grasslands before I had to leave. The once handsome little boy, Bayara, had grown into a tall and handsome young man.

In these 10 years, he had acted in plays, and also appeared in television and films. The letters he wrote to me were not only grammatically correct but also beautifully written. He said to me, "Come back in 10 years to see what the grasslands will look like then." I said, "It can only be more and more beautiful."

The old mother kept scolding me for not bringing my children back. I also regretted it. I didn't expect that the ethnic bond formed 15 years ago would be so enduring that it could extend to the next generation.

As I prepared to leave, the old mother repeatedly reminded me: "Next time, definitely bring your children back." I agreed.

　　悠远的亲情
　　王冬梅
    夏天，正是草原上盛产奶豆腐的季节。
    那天，我收到一个寄自当年插队的内蒙古克什克腾旗白音查干苏木沙胡同的邮包，里面是一块久违的奶豆腐。来自几千里之外的奶香，勾起了我心中的怀恋之情。
    我竟然又像15年前那样，踏上西去的列车，带着几串给姑娘们的项链，几包给孩子们的糖果就奔向了草原，如同一个远在外地工作的回乡探亲者。
    我的归来令乡亲们惊喜，而草原更让我惊喜。10年不见，草原更加肥美，五畜更加兴旺，生活更加富裕。我们那时在沙胡同耕种的几百亩土地，已经退耕还牧，长满绿草鲜花；我们那时渴望得到却很难得到的交通工具——骏马，已经被淘汰，小伙子们骑上了崭新的摩托车；我们那时半个月乃至更长时间才能收到成捆的报纸，如今，电视机搬进了蒙古包。只有人，还是那般淳朴，那般好客，那般豪爽，那般善良。
    1974年，我们从大连下乡到这里，第一次见到草原，第一次和说着不同语言的人坐在蒙古包里，吃手扒肉，喝奶子酒，唱蒙古歌。
    平日，我们向他们学蒙语，村里的年轻人向我们学汉语，他们的速度比我们快10倍。他们好学，聪明。
    草原离北京很远，离边境线很近。牧民的蒙古袍，白天是衣服，晚上是被褥。直到1968年，北京和赤峰市的第一批知识青年到来后，他们才普遍用被褥，但依然用着古老的木轮勒勒车。牧民告诉我们：现在比过去强多了。我们却觉得现在依然落后。比如女孩子很久不洗头发，任虱子在头上横行。有一天歇工，我烧了一大锅水，挨个儿给她们洗头。几天后，她们来借脸盆，要自己洗头，我恨不得把所有的盆都借给她们。
    冬天，我们没柴烧，也没有干牛粪取暖。老额吉（妈妈）们拉着我们冻伤的手，心疼地哭了。随后，她们分别把我们接到自己家住，像照料自己的孩子一样，早晨替我们烧好洗脸水，晚上为我们烧暖热炕。草原的冬天很漫长，燃料珍贵，她们却为我们一年烧掉两年柴。望着她们那被岁月刻满皱纹的脸，我们就想起自己的母亲。
    我们处得亲如一家。草原虽然闭塞，人际关系却很开放，没有那么多封建礼教的束缚。没出嫁的姑娘们一针一线为男知青缝制艺术品般的蒙古靴，蒙古族小伙子也骑马带女知青去很远的地方看马群。
    后来，我们陆续回城了。每次走人，老额吉们便像送别亲人一样，婆婆妈妈地千叮咛，万嘱咐，哭哭啼啼地送了一程又一程。我上大学走的那天，汽车都开动了，老额吉还让儿子从窗口塞进来一张羊皮，叫我铺床上别冻着。我们就这样带着让人牵挂的乡情离去了。
    来也匆匆，去也匆匆。我还没把草原的变化看够就要走了。昔日漂亮的小男孩巴雅拉已经长成了英俊的大小伙子。
    这10年里，他演过话剧，还拍过电视和电影，他给我写的信不仅文字通顺，而且优美流畅。他对我说：“过10年再回来看看吧，看看那时草原会变成什么样。”我说：“只能更美更美。”
    老额吉一个劲儿埋怨我为什么不带孩子回来？我也后悔，我没想到，15年前结下的民族亲情会悠远得足以延续到下一代。
    临行，老额吉再三叮咛：下次一定带孩子回来。我答应了。
