China's health sector has rapidly developed, and the level of medical and health care has significantly improved.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 14 (Reporter Yu Changhong): The level of medical and health care that the Chinese people enjoy has significantly improved compared to before the founding of the People's Republic.

Relevant departments introduced that at the time of liberation, the country had only 3,670 health institutions, 84,000 beds, and 505,000 health technical personnel. By the end of 1988, China's health institutions had developed to 206,000, with 2,794,000 beds and 4,678,000 health technical personnel. The number of outpatient treatments received by various levels and types of hospitals nationwide increased from 240 million at the beginning of liberation to 2.6 billion, and the number of inpatients increased from 5.43 million at the beginning of liberation to 51.58 million.

Developing rural health care has always been a strategic focus of China's health work. The country has basically established and improved a three-tier medical and health care network at the county, township, and village levels.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, the development of the health sector has, to a great extent, met the basic medical and health care needs of urban and rural residents, ensuring the continuous improvement of the people's health level. China's infant mortality rate has decreased from 250 per thousand before liberation to 35 per thousand; the incidence and mortality rates of various common diseases have significantly decreased; the life expectancy of the Chinese people has increased from 35 years before liberation to 69 years now.

　　我国卫生事业迅速发展
　　医疗保健水平显著提高
    据新华社北京9月14日电（记者于长洪）我国人民享有医疗保健的水平比建国前有大幅度提高。
    有关部门介绍，解放时，全国卫生事业机构只有3670个，病床8.4万张，卫生技术人员50.5万人；而到1988年底，我国卫生事业机构就发展到20.6万个，病床279.4万张，卫生技术人员467.8万人。全国各级各类医院每年接受门诊治疗的人次由解放初的2.4亿增加到26亿，接受住院治疗的人数由解放初543万增加到5158万。
    发展农村卫生事业一直是我国卫生工作的战略重点。全国基本上建立健全了县、乡、村三级医疗卫生网。
    建国后，卫生事业的发展在很大程度上解决了城乡居民对医疗卫生保健的基本要求，保证了人民健康水平的不断提高。我国婴儿死亡率已由解放前的250‰降到35‰；各种常见疾病的发病率和死亡率都已明显下降；我国人民的期望寿命已从解放前的35岁增加到现在的69岁。
