Song Jian, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, recently offered opinions on the work of China's rural supply and marketing cooperatives, pointing out that supply and marketing cooperatives should shift towards science and technology as their pillar, rely on technological advantages, organize farmers, serve farmers, and form a comprehensive service system, becoming a source of rural system reforms in the future.

This viewpoint was proposed by Comrade Song Jian in a letter he wrote to Zhang Runshen, Vice Governor of Hebei Province, and Zhen Fude, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, at the end of August this year.

In mid-July, Zhang Runshen and Zhen Fude wrote an article titled "With Science and Technology as the Leader, and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives as the Foundation, Improving the Agricultural Service System." The article stated that under the condition that the household contract responsibility system remains unchanged, leading with science and technology and relying on supply and marketing cooperatives, providing series services for agriculture through cooperative paths, is the way for China's agriculture to transform from a natural economy to a commodity economy and from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. It is also an important path for the second step of rural reforms.

After reading the article by Zhang Runshen and Zhen Fude, Song Jian pointed out that supply and marketing cooperatives are a very favorable foundation for developing a rural scale commodity economy based on science and technology. If those engaged in the work of supply and marketing cooperatives can realize this, there will be great hope.

　　宋健对农村供销社工作提出意见
　　供销社要依靠科技优势形成完善体系服务于农
    据新华社北京9月9日电　（记者范平、通讯员刘金林）国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健最近对我国农村供销社工作提出意见，指出供销社要转向以科技为支柱，要依靠科技优势，组织农民，服务于农民，形成全程服务体系，变成农村今后体制改革的发源地。
    这个观点，是宋健同志在今年8月底写给河北省副省长张润身和河北省供销社副主任甄福德的一封信中提出的。
    今年7月中旬，张润身和甄福德撰写了一篇题为《以科技为先导，以供销社为依托，完善农业服务体系》的文章。文章说，在以家庭为基本核算单位的体制不变的条件下，以科技为先导，以供销合作社为依托，通过为农业系列化服务，走合作制道路，是我国农业由自然经济向商品经济转化、由传统农业向现代农业转化的出路，是农村第二步改革的重要途径。宋健读了张润身和甄福德的文章后指出，供销社是发展农村以科技为支柱的规模商品经济的非常有利的基础阵地之一。如果从事供销社工作的同志们都能意识到这一点，那就大有希望了。
