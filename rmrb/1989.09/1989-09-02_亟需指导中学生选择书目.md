A recent survey conducted by the Nankai District Education Bureau in Tianjin among some middle school students on "Summer Reading Materials for Middle School Students" revealed that middle school students enjoy reading, have active thoughts, and a strong desire to learn. However, they lack the ability to choose books that suit their own characteristics and need guidance from parents, teachers, and cultural departments.

Weak analytical skills and the inability to distinguish between good and bad books are significant issues faced by middle school students in their reading habits. This survey showed that some students had read five banned books during the summer vacation. A few students even expressed a desire to read Hitler's "Mein Kampf." A student from a certain middle school wrote in the survey:
"I like to read books about erotic content; I don't like much else." A student from a well-known middle school reported reading "The Lotus Sutra" and "The Great Compassion Mantra" during the summer.

When asked about their future reading plans, the 240 surveyed students had a wide range of interests. Fifty-seven wanted to read classic literature, 38 wanted to read "The Return of the Condor Heroes," "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," and other popular novels, 23 wanted to read science books, 21 wanted to read science fiction, and many others expressed interest in poetry, music, biographies, sports, reportage, psychology, and philosophy.

Notably, there is a growing demand among middle school students for publications that reflect their spirit and real-life experiences. In this survey, 81 students simultaneously called for: "More books that help improve the cultivation of young people and are beneficial to our physical and mental health." Facing the urgent reading desires of these students and their lack of analytical skills, who should guide them? Who should respond to their calls? Should it be teachers, families, the publishing industry, society, or a combination of all these? These lovely middle school students have presented a new questionnaire to society.

### 亟需指导中学生选择书目

    亟需指导中学生选择书目
    天津市南开区教育局最近在部分中学学生中进行的“中学生暑期读物问卷调查”结果表明，中学生喜欢读书，思想活跃，求知欲强，但对读什么样的书适合自己的特点不会选择，需要家长、教师及社会文化部门给予指导。
    分析能力不强，对鱼龙混杂的书刊良莠难辨，是当前中学生在阅读中所存在的一大弊病。这次“中学生暑期读物问卷调查”显示，一些学生曾在暑假期间看过被查禁的书刊5种6册。有个别学生提出想看希特勒的《我的奋斗》。某中学的一名学生在问卷中写道：
  “我喜欢看关于色情方面的书，别的不太喜欢。”某颇有名气中学的一位学生，暑期看的书是《妙法莲华经》、《大悲咒》等。
    在回答“今后你打算看哪些书”一问时，被调查的240名学生的打算堪称五花八门，海阔天空。57人要看中外名著，38人要看《天龙八部》、
  《福尔摩斯探案集》等通俗小说，23人要看科普读物，21人要看科幻小说，还有不少学生则分别表示对诗歌音乐、名人传记、体育书籍、报告文学、心理学、哲学方面的书刊有兴趣。
    值得注意的是，当前中学生希望出版表现中学生精神风貌、真实反映中学生生活书刊的呼声高涨。在这次问卷调查中，还有81名中学生不约而同地发出呼吁：“多多出版有助于提高青少年修养、有益我们身心健康的好书。”面对着广大中学生迫切的读书欲望，面对着他们缺乏分析能力的客观现实，应该由谁来引导他们？由谁来响应他们的呼吁呢？是教师、家庭、出版界、社会？还是兼而有之？这些可爱的中学生们，向人们提出了一份新的问卷。
