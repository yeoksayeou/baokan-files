The United States has long been known for its thriving gambling industry. Just last year, the amount of money wagered on car races and horse races alone reached $50 billion. Roulette gambling consumed at least $60 billion, and slot machines "devoured" $37 billion...

What is even more worrying to people of insight in various circles is that among the 5 million people nationwide who have become "addicted" to gambling, 10% are middle school students. A newspaper warned that if "professional gamblers" 15 years ago were businessmen, now they are young men under the age of 20. Notably, as middle school students receive more pocket money from their parents and the number of students working part-time jobs increases, the stakes in middle school gambling are also getting higher. In Florida, two high school students went to a casino one night, and after a night of "battling," one won over $10,000, while the other lost $8,000. Several middle school students in Los Angeles admitted that they used to go to the casino only on weekends, but now they visit "daily." A teacher pointed out that many states issue lotteries to increase revenue, which fuels young people's gambling psychology; moreover, parents who are enthusiastic about gambling also set a "bad example" for their children.

Faced with this large group of "young gamblers," schools, parents, and society are all at a loss. A sociologist lamented, "We have exerted tremendous effort to stop the trend of young people using drugs, but now we are facing a gambling craze!"

    美国中学生赌博成风
    唐若水
    美国一向以赌博业“兴旺发达”而“著称于世”。仅在去年，在汽车大赛和赛马会上用以打赌的钱高达500亿美元，轮盘赌耗去金额至少600亿美元，“吃角子老虎”则
  “吃掉”了370亿美元……
    更使各界有识之士忧心忡忡的是，在全国500万业已
  “成瘾”的赌徒中，竟有10％是中学生。一家报纸警告说，如果说“职业赌棍”在15年前是经商者，那么眼下却由不到20岁的男性小青年取而代之。值得注意的是，由于中学生从父母那儿获取的零用钱越来越多，加上中学生打短工挣钱者也与日俱增，中学生赌博时下的赌注数额也越来越大。佛州有两名高中生某晚同去一家赌场，经一夜“鏖战”，有一位赢了1万余美元，另一位则输了8000美元。洛杉矶市几名中学生承认，以前仅周末去赌场，现在则是“天天光顾”。一位教师指出：许多州为增加收入滥发彩票，这助长了年青人的赌博心理；此外，热衷于赌博的家长也给孩子们作出了“坏榜样”。
    面对这一大批“年青赌徒”，学校、家长、社会都一筹莫展。一位社会学家悲叹道：“我们费了九牛二虎之力还不能制止年青人的吸毒风，但现在却又刮起了赌博风！”
