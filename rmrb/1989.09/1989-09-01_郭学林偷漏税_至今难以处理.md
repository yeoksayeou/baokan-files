In 1987, our bureau discovered that 86 sand and gravel specialists in our city had tax evasion issues. Among them, sand and gravel specialist Guo Xuelin evaded 13,000 yuan in business tax from 1986 to 1987 and had long overdue income tax of 11,000 yuan. The municipal tax bureau ordered Guo Xuelin to pay the evaded taxes and imposed a fine, totaling 51,000 yuan. However, Guo Xuelin used various excuses to delay and resist, refusing to pay the taxes.

On April 30, 1988, our bureau's case handlers transferred the materials on Guo Xuelin's tax evasion to the chief of the tax prosecution office stationed at the municipal tax bureau, requesting an investigation. Soon after, the chief told us that the original materials had gone missing. Therefore, the municipal tax bureau reorganized its forces to reinvestigate and gather evidence. On May 22, the municipal tax bureau held a meeting and decided to uphold the original decision. However, to this day, Guo Xuelin still refuses to pay the taxes and fines. It is necessary to investigate whether someone is secretly supporting Guo Xuelin.

    郭学林偷漏税  至今难以处理
    1987年我所查出我市86户砂石专业户存在偷漏税问题，其中砂石专业户郭学林在1986年至1987年两年间偷漏营业税1.3万多元，长期拖欠所得税1.1万多元。对此，市税务局让郭学林补交偷漏的税款，并对他罚款，两项共计5.1万多元。但郭学林以种种借口软拖硬抗，拒不补缴税款。
    1988年4月30日，我所办案人员将郭学林偷漏税款的材料移交市检察院派驻市税务局税务检察室主任，要求立案侦查。不久这位主任对我们说原始材料不见了。于是，市税务局又重新组织力量调查取证。5月22日，市税务局召开会议，决定维持原处理意见。但时至今日，郭学林仍坚持拒绝交纳税款和罚款。有没有他人暗中支持郭学林，需要查清。
