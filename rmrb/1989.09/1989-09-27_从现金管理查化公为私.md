Edition: 6

The cash holdings of various units are the fiscal revenues of the state and collective, and are the wealth created by the laboring masses with their diligent and intelligent hands. Strictly managing cash in accordance with the law and regulations is, in essence, using the state's political power and administrative authority and legal means to maintain social economy and consolidate the socialist public ownership system.

Currently, some units and individuals, in pursuit of personal gains and immediate benefits, dare to violate financial and economic laws and regulations, and even harm the interests of the state and collective. They resort to various means to tamper with the cash reserves of various units. From the nine letters to the editor published here, some have long-term misuse or borrowing of public funds, akin to "Liu Bei borrowing Jingzhou—borrowing but not returning"; some store public funds privately, earning interest and using them at will; some use blank receipts for accounting, and even if they tamper with them, others are helpless... The core issue here is the privatization of public funds. The state and collective income is unknown how much has fallen into the pockets of individuals or small groups in this way!

Currently, our country's fiscal system faces many difficulties, and the government is taking various measures to overcome them. All units should, from the perspective of the overall situation, seriously examine whether there are any privatization behaviors in cash management. Through the examination, check whether the people in charge of financial power strictly enforce financial and economic disciplines, adhere to principles, and do not seek personal gains. Those with serious economic problems should be decisively transferred; check the implementation of various financial and economic systems, whether there are behaviors that trample on the systems, and if so, correct them immediately; check whether financial supervision is implemented, and seriously deal with those who do not fulfill their supervisory responsibilities or intentionally cover up illegal behaviors, causing economic losses to the state and collective. At the same time, for the financial and economic cases reported and cared about by the masses, they should also be seriously investigated and dealt with, and illegal and criminal activities in finance and banking should be resolutely cracked down on.

### 从现金管理查化公为私

    从现金管理查化公为私
    各单位的现金，是国家、集体的财政收入，是劳动群众用勤劳智慧的双手换来的财富。严格依法照章管理现金，实质上是凭借国家的政治力量，以行政权力和法律手段来维护社会经济，巩固社会主义的公有制。
    当前，有些单位、个人为了谋取私利，捞钱得“实惠”，竟不惜违反财经法纪，不惜坑害国家、集体利益，千方百计地在各单位库存现金上做手脚。从这里发表的9封读者来信看，有的长期挪用、借用公款，来个“刘备借荆州——只借不还”；有的将公款私存，既可得利息，又可随便支用；有的用白条子报帐，即使从中捣了鬼，别人也无可奈何……这些，核心是化公为私。国家和集体的收入一年不知有多少就这样落入了个人或小团体的腰包！
    现在，我们国家的财政存在许多困难，政府正在采取各种办法进行克服。各个单位要从大局出发，认真查一查在现金管理中，有无化公为私的行为。从检查中，看一看掌握财权的人，是否严格执行财经纪律，坚持原则，不谋私利，要把有严重经济问题的人坚决调离；看一看各种财经制度执行的情况，有没有践踏制度的行为，如果有，立即纠正；看一看财务监督是否实行，严肃处理那些不履行监督职责，或有意掩盖违法行为，给国家、集体造成经济损失的责任者。与此同时，对群众举报的、关心的财经案件，也要认真查处，坚决打击财政金融中的违法犯罪活动。
