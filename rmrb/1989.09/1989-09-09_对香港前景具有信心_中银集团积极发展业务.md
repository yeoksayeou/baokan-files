Despite being hit by a run on deposits in early June, the China Bank Group has not slowed down its business expansion. One of the group's members, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, opened a branch in Hong Kong's Kowloon district on Green Island today. This is the sixth branch the group has opened since June.

According to officials from the Hong Kong and Macau Management Office of the Bank of China, the China Bank Group is currently the second-largest banking group in Hong Kong, following the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. This year, the group has opened eight new branches in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, bringing the total number of its branches to over 300. Some members are actively preparing to open more branches. It is estimated that more than 10 new branches will be opened this year, making it a year with a relatively high number of new institutions.

Officials from the management office believe that the China Bank Group's active opening of new branches is a manifestation of its confidence in Hong Kong's economic future. Currently, the group's various businesses are developing steadily, and it is actively exploring new businesses and services.
