The Armed Police Force must strengthen the construction of its political work cadre team and enhance the status and role of political work. This was the main topic of the Political Work Conference of the Armed Police Force held from September 15 to 19.

The political commissars of the armed police total units from various provinces attended this conference. The conference believed that the Armed Police Force, from the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary riot, did not find a single person supporting and participating in the parade and cheering activities. The reason for passing the political examination is that this force has always been strict in political education and the key moment of ideological and political work is kept up.

The commander-in-chief of the Armed Police Force, Li Lianxiu, the political commissar, Zhang Xiufu, the deputy commander-in-chief, Fan Zhilun, the deputy political commissar, Zhang Haitian, and the deputy minister of public security, Hu Zhiguang, attended the conference. In their speeches, they pointed out: We emphasize that political work is the lifeline, so we must strengthen the construction of the political work cadre team. Those who are understaffed should be promptly filled, and those who lack political work experience should undergo training and leadership guidance to improve their quality.

　　武警部队政治工作研讨会提出
　　必须提高政治工作地位
    本报北京9月19日讯　武警部队必须大力加强政治工作干部队伍建设，提高政治工作的地位和作用。这是9月15日至19日召开的武警部队政治工作研讨会的主要议题。
    各省武警总队政治部主任参加了这次会议。会议认为，武警部队从动乱到反革命暴乱没发现一个人支持和参加游行、声援活动，之所以政治上考试合格，是因为这支部队平时政治教育抓得紧，关键时刻思想政治工作跟得上。
    武警部队司令员李连秀、政委张秀夫、副司令员范志伦、副政委张海天、公安部副部长胡之光参加会议。他们在讲话中指出：我们强调政治工作是生命线，就必须加强政治工作干部队伍建设，缺编的要及时配齐，缺乏政治工作经验的要经过办班和领导传帮带，提高他们的素质。　（钟长洪）
