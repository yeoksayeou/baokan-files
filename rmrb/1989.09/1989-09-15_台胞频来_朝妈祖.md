On August 23, the 42-episode television series "Mazu's Legend" produced by Taiwan's "City of Arts" Cultural Enterprise Co., Ltd. began airing on Taiwan Island, causing a sensation. The outdoor scenes for this series were shot by a large team sent by the Taiwan company to Wuyishan and Meizhou Island in July.

Mazu, originally named Lin Mo, was a native of Meizhou Island. During her lifetime, she was known for her benevolence and frequently went to sea to rescue fishermen and merchant ships in distress. After her death, she was posthumously honored by successive dynasties with titles such as "Heavenly Empress," "Empress of Heaven," and "Holy Mother in Heaven," and is revered by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

Since Taiwan allowed visits to the mainland, groups of Taiwanese pilgrims have been coming to pay their respects to Mazu. Starting last year, over 55,000 people have come in tour groups alone. Even during the Beijing crackdown, Taiwanese visitors continued to arrive in an unbroken stream. The upcoming Chongyang Festival, which marks Mazu's "ascension to heaven," is expected to see a large number of Taiwanese visitors coming to Meizhou Island to pay their respects.

　　台胞频来　朝妈祖
    8月23日，台湾“艺之城”文化事业有限公司摄制的42集电视连续剧《妈祖外传》第一集在台湾岛播出，引起轰动。这部连续剧的外景是台湾公司7月份派大批人员到武夷山、湄洲岛拍摄的。
    妈祖原名林默，湄洲岛人，生前乐于施善，经常下海救助遇难的渔民和商船，死后被历代朝廷敕封为“天妃”、“天后”、“天上圣母”等尊号，为海峡两岸同胞共仰。
    台湾开放大陆探亲以后，朝拜妈祖的台胞香客组团结队而来。去年起，仅旅行团队客人就达5.5万多人次。北京平暴期间，台胞仍络绎不绝。即将到来的重阳节为妈祖“羽化升天”日，届时将有大批台胞来湄洲岛朝奉。
