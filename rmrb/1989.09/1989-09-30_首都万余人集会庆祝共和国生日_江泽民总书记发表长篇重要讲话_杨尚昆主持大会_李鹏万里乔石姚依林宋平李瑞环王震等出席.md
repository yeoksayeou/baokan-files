Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th.

Tens of thousands of people from various sectors in the capital gathered this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, stating that the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been a period of tremendous change, a period of overcoming numerous difficulties and making continuous progress, and a period during which the Chinese nation has regained its dignity, achieved independence and autonomy, and played an increasingly important role in international affairs. Looking back at the past and forward to the future, standing firmly on Chinese soil and looking out at the world, we are full of confidence in the cause of socialism and in the communist future of humanity.

Today, the capital was clear and sunny. A large color portrait of Comrade Mao Zedong hung prominently on the red wall of Tiananmen Gate. Across the square stood a giant color portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The Five-Star Red Flag fluttered in the breeze over the square. The colorful banners on the tall buildings and the flowers on the square and along Chang'an Street added to the festive and joyous atmosphere of the capital on the eve of the national holiday.

In the Great Hall of the People, a giant national emblem hung in the center of the stage, with the words "1949-1989" beneath it, and ten bright red flags on either side.

At 3 PM, Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, and other comrades arrived at the conference stage to congratulate the attendees of the National Labor Models and Advanced Workers Commendation Conference, the representatives of outstanding soldiers from the grassroots level of the People's Liberation Army, the representatives of military families and martyrs' families, the members of the National Minorities National Day Visiting Group, and the representatives of various sectors in the capital. The Great Hall of the People erupted in enthusiastic applause.

Yang Shangkun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the President of the State, announced the beginning of the celebration. The military band played the national anthem.

Jiang Zemin delivered his speech amidst enthusiastic applause. He first, on behalf of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, paid tribute to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, members of democratic parties, and patriotic figures of all sectors who have contributed to the socialist construction on various fronts. He paid tribute to the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the People's Police who have established historical merits in defending the People's Republic and the socialist cause. He extended warm greetings to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and to overseas Chinese who are dedicated to the reunification of the motherland and the revitalization of China. He expressed heartfelt thanks to all foreign friends and people of various countries who have friendly relations with us and support China's modernization construction.

Jiang Zemin said, "Here, we also pay our highest respect and deeply miss the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries who have made great contributions to the founding and construction of the socialist People's Republic, such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De, and the revolutionary martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the establishment and defense of New China."

He pointed out that we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation shortly after achieving the decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and successfully holding the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. Practice has already and will continue to prove that the policies and measures adopted by the Party and the government to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion have prevented the country and the people from falling into a serious internal chaos and historical retrogression, which is in line with the common will and fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We can confidently declare that any attempt by foreign hostile forces to turn China into a vassal state will be doomed to failure, and any plot by domestic hostile forces to reverse the verdict on the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion will be doomed to failure. This victory further proves that the socialist path chosen by the Communist Party of China to lead the Chinese people and the ongoing socialist reform cause have become an irreversible historical trend on the vast land of China. The progress and development of socialist China are unstoppable by any difficulties and unshakable by any domestic and foreign hostile forces.

Jiang Zemin, after reviewing our use of Marxism-Leninism's state theory to establish a socialist state power of people's democratic dictatorship in combination with China's actual situation, the implementation of the people's congress system, and the formation of the broadest patriotic united front, said, "Although our political system still needs to be gradually improved, it will definitely provide ample possibilities and broad prospects for the democratization of the country's political, economic, cultural, and social life through self-reform and development."

In his speech, he reviewed the progress and development of socialist construction on various fronts in the past 40 years, especially in the past 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. He said, "Our economic development and the improvement of people's living standards are not only extremely remarkable compared to China's past history but also not inferior to many other countries. We must fully affirm the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the socialist system. Any view that doubts or denies our achievements is groundless, erroneous, and harmful. At the same time, we must fully recognize and resolutely correct the mistakes in our work. The view that does not admit mistakes is also groundless, erroneous, and harmful."

Jiang Zemin said, "Reviewing the history of the past 40 years, we can at least draw four basic conclusions:

The establishment, consolidation, and development of the socialist system reflect the objective laws of modern Chinese social movements and are the greatest and most profound changes in Chinese history. As Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China.

The socialist system is a system that develops and improves on its own basis. Under socialist conditions, our fundamental task is to take economic construction as the center and vigorously develop social productive forces. The great achievements of the past ten years prove that the general policy and general line of reform and opening up are completely correct and must be firmly carried out.

The spirit of patriotism should be carried forward, and the policy of independence and self-reliance should be adhered to. This is a fundamental experience for the victory of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction.

The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the faithful representative of the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China. The Communist Party of China has become the core of leadership for the Chinese revolution and construction, which is the correct choice made by the people in long-term practice. The situation of the Party is of decisive significance to the destiny of the country and the nation. We must seriously and ruthlessly analyze and resolutely correct the mistakes in our work and solve the problems within the Party."

Jiang Zemin emphasized that based on the above basic conclusions, we must more firmly combine Marxism's universal truth with China's specific realities, walk our own path, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific theory that has been recognized and accepted by hundreds of millions of people after ten years of practice and is the banner guiding us to continue to advance.

He said, "Throughout the entire primary stage of socialism, we must firmly implement the basic line formulated by the 13th Party Congress: to lead and unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, be self-reliant, and work hard to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country. At present, we must work together to consolidate and develop the victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity, and strive to achieve stable development of the national economy.

Jiang Zemin also emphasized ten important issues that need special attention in the current work of the Party and the state. These ten issues are: the issue of adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to reform and opening up, the issue of strategic deployment of China's economic development and rectification and reform, the issue of adhering to the combination of planned economy and market regulation, the issue of adhering to the public ownership system and developing various economic components, the issue of adhering to the distribution system with remuneration according to labor as the mainstay and preventing and correcting social distribution inequality, the issue of strengthening agriculture and other basic industries and adjusting the economic structure, the issue of socialist democracy and legal system construction, the issue of socialist spiritual civilization construction, the issue of strengthening the leadership of the working class, consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, and enhancing the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and the issue of strengthening the construction of the Party.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the current international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation, from confrontation to dialogue, and peace and development are the two major themes of the world today. We have the possibility of securing a relatively long period of peaceful international environment for China's socialist modernization construction. However, it must be seen that the world is not peaceful and there are still many contradictions, struggles, and unstable factors. He especially emphasized that international reactionary forces have never abandoned their fundamental stance of hostility and subversion towards the socialist system. The struggle between infiltration and anti-infiltration, subversion and anti-subversion, "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution" is long-term. On this point, the people of all ethnic groups in the country, all Party comrades, especially leading cadres, must maintain a high degree of vigilance.

Jiang Zemin emphasized that the Chinese people adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and the Chinese people will never allow others to infringe upon their sacred right to historical choice.

He said, "To accelerate the pace of China's socialist modernization construction, while relying on our own strength to actively develop China's economy and science and technology, we must strive to learn the advanced science and technology and management experience of developed countries, and effectively utilize foreign funds. We respect all foreign governments and friends who treat us equally, and will continue to develop and strive to expand friendly cooperative relations with them. We must firmly maintain the sovereignty, national independence, and dignity of the socialist motherland while firmly implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world."

Jiang Zemin highly praised the armed forces led by the Party, especially the People's Liberation Army, and hoped that the whole Party and the people of the whole country would pay great attention to and strengthen national defense construction, pay attention to and strengthen national defense education, enhance the national defense consciousness of the whole nation, and strive to promote the revolutionary, modern, and regular construction of the army.

Jiang Zemin said, "We will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macao regions, nor will we allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the central government. With the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the Hong Kong and Macao regions will be more stable and prosperous. To complete the reunification of the motherland, we place our hopes on the people of Taiwan and also on the authorities in Taiwan. The authorities in Taiwan should follow the trend of history and make wise decisions that are beneficial to the reunification of the motherland as soon as possible."

Jiang Zemin concluded, "Let us, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strengthen unity with various democratic parties, non-partisan personages, and all patriotic personages, strengthen the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, invigorate the national spirit, and advance resolutely along the socialist path to achieve greater victories in the socialist cause."

During Jiang Zemin's speech, the brightly lit Great Hall of the People erupted in enthusiastic applause 17 times.

The meeting ended with the stirring song "The Internationale."

    首都万余人集会庆祝共和国生日  江泽民总书记发表长篇重要讲话
    杨尚昆主持大会　李鹏万里乔石姚依林宋平李瑞环王震等出席
    新华社北京9月29日电　（记者李尚志）首都各界群众一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂隆重集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年。
    中共中央总书记江泽民在大会上发表长篇讲话指出，中华人民共和国成立以来的四十年，是中国历史发生翻天覆地变化的四十年，是经历艰难曲折、战胜种种困难、不断发展进步的四十年，是中华民族扬眉吐气、独立自主、在国际事务中日益发挥重要作用的四十年。回顾过去，展望未来，立足中国，放眼世界，我们对社会主义事业充满信心，对人类的共产主义前途充满信心。
    今天，首都秋高气爽，阳光灿烂。毛泽东同志的大幅彩色画像高悬在天安门城楼红墙中央，广场对面耸立着孙中山先生的巨幅彩色画像。五星红旗在广场上迎风飘扬。高大建筑物上的彩旗和广场上、东西长安街上的鲜花，更增加了首都盛大节日前的热烈、欢庆的气氛。
    万人礼堂主席台正中，悬挂着巨大的国徽，下面是“1949—1989”的字样，两边是十面鲜艳的红旗。
    下午3时，江泽民、杨尚昆、李鹏、万里、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、王震等同志，来到大会主席台，向出席全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会的同志，人民解放军基层优秀官兵代表，烈军属代表，全国少数民族国庆参观团成员和首都各界群众代表祝贺节日，万人礼堂里响起热烈掌声。
    中共中央政治局委员、国家主席杨尚昆宣布庆祝大会开始。军乐队高奏国歌。
    江泽民总书记在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先代表中共中央和国务院向在各条战线上为社会主义建设贡献力量的全国各族工人、农民、知识分子、各民主党派和各界爱国人士致敬，向为保卫人民共和国和社会主义事业建立了历史功勋的中国人民解放军、武警部队、人民警察致敬，向致力于统一祖国和振兴中华的港澳同胞、台湾同胞、海外侨胞致以亲切的问候，向一切同我们友好相处、支持中国现代化建设的外国朋友和世界各国人民表示衷心的谢意。
    江泽民说，在这里，我们还怀着崇高的敬意，深切怀念为缔造和建设社会主义人民共和国立下伟大功勋的毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德等已故老一代无产阶级革命家，深切怀念为创建和捍卫新中国而英勇牺牲的革命先烈。
    他指出，我们是在赢得制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，完满召开了党的十三届四中全会之后不久，迎来建国四十周年的光辉节日的。实践已经并将继续证明，党和政府为制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱而采取的方针和措施，使国家和人民避免了陷入严重内乱和历史倒退的巨大灾难，是符合全国各族人民的共同意志和根本利益的。我们完全可以断言，国外敌对势力妄想把中国变为附庸的任何企图，国内敌对势力妄想为动乱和反革命暴乱翻案的任何图谋，都将彻底破产。这场斗争的胜利，进一步证明了中国共产党领导中国人民选择的社会主义道路和正在进行的社会主义改革事业，在中国辽阔的大地上已经成为不可逆转的历史潮流。社会主义中国的前进和发展，是任何困难都阻挡不了的，是任何国内外敌对势力都动摇和改变不了的。
    江泽民在回顾了我们运用马克思列宁主义的国家学说，结合中国的实际建立了人民民主专政的社会主义国家政权、实行人民代表大会制度、组成最广泛的爱国统一战线之后说，尽管我们的政治制度还有待于逐步完善，但是它经过自我改革和发展，一定能够为国家政治、经济、文化、社会生活的民主化，提供充分的可能性和广阔的前景。
    他在讲话中回顾了四十年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会后的十年来，我国各条战线社会主义建设的进步和发展。他说，我们的经济发展和人民生活水平的提高，不仅同我国过去历史相比极为显著，而且同其他许多国家相比也并不逊色。我们必须充分肯定中国人民在社会主义制度下取得的辉煌成就。任何怀疑、否定我们成就的观点，都是没有根据的，是错误的和有害的。同时，我们又必须充分认识和坚决纠正我们工作中的失误。不承认失误的观点，同样是没有根据的，是错误的和有害的。
    江泽民说，回顾四十年的历史，我们至少可以得出四个方面的基本结论：
    社会主义制度的确立、巩固和发展，体现了中国现代社会运动的客观规律，是中国历史上最伟大、最深刻的变革。正如毛泽东同志和邓小平同志所指出的，只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。
    社会主义制度是在自身基础上不断发展和完善的制度，在社会主义条件下，我们的根本任务是以经济建设为中心，大力发展社会生产力。我们十年的巨大成绩证明，改革开放的总方针、总政策是完全正确的，必须坚定不移地贯彻下去。
    发扬爱国主义精神，坚持独立自主、自力更生的方针，是中国革命也是中国社会主义建设取得胜利的一条根本经验。
    用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党，是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是中国各族人民利益的忠实代表。中国共产党成为中国革命和建设的领导核心，是人民在长期实践中做出的正确选择。党的状况如何，对于国家和民族的命运具有决定性的意义。我们必须严肃地毫不留情地剖析和坚决纠正工作中的失误，解决党内存在的问题。
    江泽民强调指出，立足于以上的基本结论，我们要更加坚定不移地把马克思主义普遍真理和我国的具体实际结合起来，走自己的路，建设有中国特色的社会主义。邓小平同志关于建设有中国特色社会主义的理论，是经过十年实践检验而为亿万人民所认识和接受的科学理论，是指引我们继续前进的旗帜。
    他说，在整个社会主义初级阶段，我们必须坚定不移地执行党的十三大制定的基本路线：领导和团结全国各族人民，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，自力更生，艰苦创业，为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家而奋斗。当前，我们必须同心协力，巩固和发展制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的胜利成果，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，努力实现国民经济的稳定发展。
    江泽民在讲话中还着重阐述了当前党和国家工作中需要特别注意统一认识的十个重要问题。这十个问题是：关于坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放相统一的问题，关于我国经济发展的战略部署和治理整顿问题，关于坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合的问题，关于坚持公有制为主体、发展多种经济成分的问题，关于坚持按劳分配为主体的多种分配形式、防止和纠正社会分配不公的问题，关于加强农业等基础产业和调整经济结构的问题，关于社会主义民主和法制建设的问题，关于社会主义精神文明建设问题，关于加强工人阶级领导、巩固工农联盟和增强全国各族人民大团结的问题，关于加强党的建设问题。
    江泽民指出，当前的国际形势正在由紧张趋向缓和，由对抗转向对话，和平与发展是当今世界的两大主题。我们有可能为我国的社会主义现代化建设，争取到一个较长时期的和平国际环境。但是必须看到，世界并不太平，仍然存在诸多矛盾、斗争和不稳定因素。他特别强调指出，国际反动势力从来没有放弃敌视和颠覆社会主义制度的根本立场。渗透与反渗透、颠覆与反颠覆、“和平演变”与反“和平演变”的斗争，是长期的。对于这一点，全国各族人民、全党同志特别是领导干部，必须保持高度的警觉。
    江泽民强调，中国人民恪守不干涉别国内政的原则，中国人民也决不能允许别人侵犯自己进行历史选择的神圣权利。
    他说，为了加速中国社会主义现代化建设的步伐，我们在依靠自己力量积极发展我国经济和科学技术的同时，要努力学习发达国家的先进科学技术、经营管理经验，积极有效地利用国外资金。我们尊重一切和我们平等交往的外国政府和外国朋友，将继续发展和努力扩大同他们之间的友好合作关系，我们必须在坚定不移地实行对外开放的过程中，坚定不移地维护国家主权、民族独立和社会主义祖国的尊严。
    江泽民讲话中高度赞扬了党领导下的以人民解放军为主体的人民武装力量，希望全党和全国人民十分重视和加强国防建设，重视和加强国防教育，增强全民族的国防意识，努力推进军队的革命化、现代化、正规化建设。
    江泽民说，我们不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，也不允许有人利用香港作为颠覆中央政府的基地。随着祖国的日益昌盛强大，港澳地区将会更加稳定繁荣。完成祖国统一，我们寄希望于台湾人民，也寄希望于台湾当局。台湾当局应该顺乎历史潮流，及早做出有利于祖国统一的明智决策。
    江泽民最后说，让我们在中国共产党的领导下，加强同各民主党派、无党派人士和一切爱国人士的团结，加强全国各族人民的大团结，振奋民族精神，坚定地沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进，争取社会主义事业的更大胜利。
    江泽民讲话过程中，灯火辉煌的万人礼堂里爆发出17次热烈的掌声。
    大会在雄壮的国际歌声中结束。
