The Lhasa River Valley agricultural comprehensive development project is one of the aid projects provided by the United Nations World Food Programme to China, with the project code "3357". The development scale includes 21 sub-projects, to be carried out in two phases and completed within five years. On July 5th of this year, the relevant parties signed the implementation plan.

The project covers an area of 5,163 square kilometers in the lower reaches of the Lhasa River Valley, with a development area of 6,672 hectares. It is estimated that by the seventh year after the project's completion, the accumulated increased income will offset the entire investment.
