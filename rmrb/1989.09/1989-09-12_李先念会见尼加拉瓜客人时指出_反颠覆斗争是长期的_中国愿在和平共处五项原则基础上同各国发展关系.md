Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, today met with Nicaraguan guests and pointed out that the struggle between China and external forces over "subversion and anti-subversion, infiltration and counter-infiltration, interference in internal affairs and anti-interference, peaceful evolution and anti-peaceful evolution" is long-term.

Li Xiannian made these remarks during a meeting with members of the National Leadership Committee of the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua and the Minister of External Cooperation, Henry Ruiz, and his delegation, at the Great Hall of the People. He expressed his gratitude to Nicaragua for its understanding and support of China in quelling the counter-revolutionary riots.

Li Xiannian said, "The turmoil that occurred in China was instigated by external forces and also had internal causes. In a sense, it was a good thing because it raised the people's vigilance against the reactionary forces' attempts to subvert socialist China. Of course, we hope that such incidents will never happen again."

Li Xiannian said, "In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic and the 10 years of reform, China has indeed achieved great successes, but there have also been mistakes. In recent years, Marxism-Leninism education has been relaxed, and the Party's leadership and political and ideological work have been weakened. This is a profound lesson that needs to be seriously summarized."

During the meeting, Li Xiannian reaffirmed that China continues to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, willing to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. However, he pointed out that the New China was won with blood and lives, and it will not allow anyone to subvert it, nor will it allow any foreign country to interfere in China's internal affairs. He said, "It is impossible for us to make concessions or compromises in this regard."

Li Xiannian said, "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to adhere to principles in politics, maintain independence in diplomacy, and rely mainly on their own strength to build the country."

Ruiz said: Nicaragua and China have a common history of struggle. China's quelling of the counter-revolutionary riots has international strategic significance, and we give it firm support. He said, "Imperialism will not change its strategy, and if one harbors illusions about the nature of imperialism, it will make a strategic mistake."

Ruiz introduced that an important task facing Nicaragua is to resist the interference of imperialist forces, defend the fruits of the revolution, and strengthen the revolutionary regime.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was present at the meeting.

　　李先念会见尼加拉瓜客人时指出
　　反颠覆斗争是长期的
　　中国愿在和平共处五项原则基础上同各国发展关系
    新华社北京9月12日电　（记者周树春）政协全国委员会主席李先念今天在会见尼加拉瓜客人时指出，中国与外来势力之间“颠覆与反颠覆、渗透与反渗透、干涉内政与反干涉内政、和平演变与反和平演变的斗争是长期的”。
    李先念在人民大会堂会见尼加拉瓜桑地诺民族解放阵线全国领导委员会成员、对外合作部部长亨利·鲁伊斯一行时，对尼加拉瓜理解和支持中国平息反革命暴乱表示感谢。
    李先念说，中国发生的这场风波既有外部势力的插手，也有内部的原因；从某种意义上讲是一件好事，因为人民因此提高了对反动势力企图颠覆社会主义人民中国的阴谋的警惕。他说：“当然，希望这样的事情再也不会发生。”
    李先念说，建国40年和改革10年来，中国的确取得了很大成就，但也有失误。近年来，放松了马克思列宁主义教育，党的领导和政治思想工作削弱了，这是需要认真总结的深刻教训。
    会见时李先念重申，中国继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界各国发展友好关系。但他指出，新中国是用鲜血和生命换来的，决不容许任何人颠覆它，也决不允许任何外国干涉中国内政。他说，“想让我们在这方面做出妥协和让步是不可能的。”
    李先念说，中国人民有志气、有能力在政治上坚持原则，外交上独立自主，经济上自力更生，主要依靠自己的力量把国家建设好。
    鲁伊斯说：尼加拉瓜和中国有着共同的斗争历史。中国平息反革命暴乱具有国际战略意义，我们给予坚决支持。他说，帝国主义不会改变其战略，如果对帝国主义的本质抱有幻想，那将犯战略性的错误。
    鲁伊斯介绍说，尼加拉瓜面临的一个重要任务就是要抵制帝国主义势力的干涉，捍卫革命成果，加强革命政权。
    会见时外交部长钱其琛在座。
