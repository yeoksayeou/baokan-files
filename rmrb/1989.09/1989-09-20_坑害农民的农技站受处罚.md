After your newspaper published the reader's letter "Agricultural Technology Departments Should Not Harm Farmers" on May 6th, the city's leaders immediately instructed relevant departments to investigate in Suzhen Township. The investigation confirmed that the situation described in the letter was true. The city made four decisions:

1. Suzhen Township Agricultural Technology Station was ordered to write a written self-criticism and post it in all villages in the township, publicly apologizing to the farmers.
2. The 450 yuan profit from the sale of 245 tons of fertilizer at inflated prices by the township agricultural technology station this year, as well as the 298 yuan in agricultural technology guidance fees collected in excess of the standard, were confiscated and turned over to the city's finances.
3. The illegal profits of 868 yuan from the sale of 28 tons of ammonium carbonate at inflated prices by the Suzhen Township Agricultural Technology Service Company's Meishan Retail Department were confiscated.
4. The relevant departments of the city will report the investigation results to the entire city and require relevant departments to take this as a warning.
