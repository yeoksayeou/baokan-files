Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 10th.

Khmer People's National Liberation Front Vice Chairman Khieu Samphan believes the Paris International Conference on Cambodia is beneficial. The Democratic Kampuchea radio station today broadcasted that on September 8th, Khmer People's National Liberation Front Vice Chairman Khieu Samphan expressed in an interview with a reporter from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front radio station that the Paris International Conference on Cambodia is beneficial. He is confident in the comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Khieu Samphan said that the one-month-long Paris International Conference is beneficial. Most representatives of the participating countries demanded that Vietnam withdraw its troops under the effective supervision of the United Nations; and that Cambodia achieve national reconciliation and establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. However, Vietnam refused to discuss these two key issues, exposing the true face of the Vietnamese invaders.

When talking about the illegal Vietnamese immigrants, Khieu Samphan said that currently, there are more than 1 million Vietnamese immigrants in Cambodia. Vietnam refuses to acknowledge this number because tens of thousands of illegal Vietnamese immigrants have already obtained Cambodian citizenship. He pointed out that Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the three Cambodian anti-Vietnamese forces are willing to solve this problem properly in the future four-party interim joint government together with the United Nations supervisory agency.

Khieu Samphan opposed Vietnam's recent request for the United Nations to send a delegation to observe its troop withdrawal at the end of September and investigate the Vietnamese immigrants. He said that only after the establishment of the four-party interim joint government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, under the effective supervision of the United Nations supervisory agency, can it be ensured that Vietnam truly withdraws from Cambodia and solves the immigrant problem.

　　民柬副主席乔森潘认为
　　柬问题巴黎国际会议有益
    新华社北京9月10日电　据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民主柬埔寨副主席乔森潘9月8日对民柬电台记者发表谈话时表示，柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议是有益的。他对全面政治解决柬埔寨问题充满信心。
    乔森潘说，持续一个月的巴黎国际会议是有益的，大多数与会国代表要求越南在联合国的有效监督下撤军；要求柬埔寨实现民族和解，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。但是，越南拒绝讨论这两个关键问题，使人们认清了越南侵略者的面目。
    在谈到越南非法移民时，乔森潘说，目前，越南在柬埔寨的移民有100多万。越南拒绝承认这一数字，因为已有几十万越南非法移民已经加入了柬埔寨国籍。他指出，西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨三派抗越力量愿意在将来的4方临时联合政府中，与联合国监督机构一起妥善地解决这一问题。
    乔森潘反对越南最近要求联合国派代表团观察它9月底的撤军和调查越南移民的做法。他说，只有成立以西哈努克亲王为首的4方临时联合政府之后，在联合国组织的监督机构有效的监督下，才能确保越南真正从柬撤军和解决移民问题。
