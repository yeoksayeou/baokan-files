The Ministry of Public Security today issued a notice, approved by the State Council, on the implementation of the resident identity card usage and verification system nationwide starting from September 15 this year. A reporter interviewed a relevant official from the Ministry of Public Security's Public Security Bureau.

The official said that the resident identity card is a legally recognized document for proving a citizen's personal identity and has a certain degree of authority. All certificates, registers, certificates, forms, vouchers, tickets, and cards issued, registered, and recorded that involve a citizen's name, gender, ethnicity, and date of birth should be based on the content recorded on the holder's resident identity card.

He said that the second article of the Ministry of Public Security's notice on the implementation of the resident identity card usage and verification system nationwide reiterates the provisions of Article 20 of the "Implementation Rules of the Resident Identity Card Regulations," which stipulates that the resident identity card is applicable to 18 matters involving citizens' rights and interests. The 18th item is "handling other matters." "Other matters" mainly include the following:

	(1) Applying for various colleges and universities or vocational and technical schools;
	(2) Withdrawing fixed-term savings, reporting the loss of savings vouchers, and withdrawing bank drafts, promissory notes, cashier's checks, traveler's checks, credit cards, and remittance funds;
	(3) Handling family property insurance and personal insurance business;
	(4) Handling family planning procedures;
	(5) Declaring personal taxable income, handling tax registration, and tax payment matters;
	(6) Handling employment, dismissal, and retirement procedures;
	(7) Applying for passes to border defense areas, special economic zones, and martial law areas;
	(8) Applying for fisherman's certificates, seafarer's certificates, and ship's certificates;
	(9) Handling customs procedures;
	(10) Registering for literary and artistic, sports competitions, or matches;
	(11) Registering private property ownership;
	(12) Purchasing goods with bank checks;
	(13) Handling auction, pawn, lease procedures, and selling scrap metal;
	(14) Handling printing business;
	(15) Engraving seals;
	(16) Claiming lost children and lost property;
	(17) Borrowing open-range archival materials;
	(18) Entering party, government, and military agencies;
	(19) Applying for holding assemblies, parades, and demonstrations;
	(20) Other matters that various departments deem necessary for citizens to present their resident identity cards to prove their identity.

The official pointed out that citizens who are not issued a resident identity card by law (excluding those serving sentences, undergoing re-education through labor, and those in custody) can use their household registration book, temporary residence permit, or student ID when handling matters involving personal rights and interests. Those under 16 years old can use their household registration book, temporary residence permit, or student ID. People's Liberation Army, armed police officers, civilian cadres, and military retirees can use their officer ID, police officer ID, civilian cadre ID, soldier ID, and military retiree ID to prove their identity.

He said that according to the law, citizens who should apply for but have not yet received a resident identity card, as well as those whose resident identity cards have been lost or damaged and are awaiting replacement, can apply for a temporary identity card as needed. Those who are 16 years old and above and have a pending permanent residence should follow relevant regulations to apply for a temporary identity card to prove their identity.

Regarding the difference between the verification and examination of resident identity cards, the official said that verification refers to: The "Resident Identity Card Regulations" authorizes the public security organs to, when performing their duties, order or compel citizens to present their resident identity cards to clarify their identity, focusing on examining the authenticity, validity, and the photograph and registered content of the cardholder. Examination refers to: Various levels of administrative management organs of the state (including public security organs), enterprises and institutions, people's organizations, and relevant departments of society, when handling matters involving citizens' rights and interests that require proof of identity, examine and check the photograph and registered content of the resident identity card presented by the citizen.

    就实施居民身份证使用和查验制度
    公安部有关负责人答记者问
    新华社北京9月8日电  经国务院批准，公安部今天发布《关于在全国实施居民身份证使用和查验制度的通告》，决定于今年9月15日开始在全国范围内实施居民身份证的使用和查验制度。就此，记者采访了公安部治安管理局负责人。
    这位负责人说，居民身份证是国家法定的证明公民个人身份的证件，具有一定权威性。凡签发、登记、注册的各种证件、簿册、证书、表格、单据、票券、卡片中，涉及公民姓名、性别、民族、出生日期基本身份内容的，均以持证人居民身份证所登记的内容为准。
    他说，公安部关于在全国实施居民身份证使用和查验制度的通告第二条，重申了《居民身份证条例实施细则》第二十条的规定，即居民身份证适用于公民办理涉及权益的十八项事务。其中，第18项为“办理其他事务”。“其他事务”主要包括下列内容：
      （一）报考各类高等学校或者中等职业、专业学校；
      （二）提前支取定期储蓄存款，储蓄存款单据挂失，支取银行汇票、本票、现金支票、旅行支票、信用卡和汇兑款项；
      （三）办理家庭财产保险和人身保险业务；
      （四）办理计划生育手续；

      （六）办理聘用、雇用和
  离、退休手续；
      （七）申领前往边防禁区、
  经济特区、戒严区通行证件；
      （八）申领出海渔民、船民证件和船舶证簿；
      （九）办理海关手续；
      （十）报名参加文艺、体育竞赛或者比赛；
      （十一）私人房屋产权登记；

      （十七）借阅属于开放范围的档案资料；
    （十八）进入党政军机关等部门；
    （十九）申请举行集会、游行、示威；
      （二十）各部门认为需要公民出示居民身份证以证明身份的其他事项。
    这位负责人指出，法律规定不发给居民身份证的公民
  （正在服刑、被劳动教养和被羁押的人除外）在办理涉及个人权益的事务时，十六周岁以下的，可以使用户口簿、暂住证或者学生证；人民解放军、武装警察部队官兵、文职干部和军队离、退休干部，可以使用军官证、警官证、文职干部证、士兵证和军队离、退休干部证明，以证明身份。
    他说，根据法律规定应当申领但尚未领到居民身份证，以及居民身份证丢失、损毁正待补领的公民，可以根据需要申领临时身份证。十六周岁以上常住户口待定人员，应当按照有关规定履行申领临时身份证手续，以证明身份。
    关于居民身份证的查验与核查的区别，这位负责人说，查验是指：《居民身份证条例》授权给公安机关在执行任务时，为查明公民身份，依法命令或强制公民出示居民身份证，重点审查、检验证件的真实性、时效性、持证人相片及其登记内容。核查是指：国家
  各级行政管理机关（包括公安
  机关）、企事业单位、人民团体
  和社会各有关部门，在办理公
  民权益事务需要证明其身份
  时，对公民出示的居民身份证
  的持证人相片和登记内容进行
  核对检查。
