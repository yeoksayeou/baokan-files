    In the recent major flood, 1,638 households in Fuxing District, Jiangbei County, Sichuan, were affected, with 551 households completely destroyed. After the flood, the entire district, under the leadership of various levels of authorities, united and helped each other to rebuild their homes. Currently, the first batch of severely affected households, with the strong support of the community and relevant units, have already moved into their new residences.

    The image shows a family of peasants from Suwan Village in Fuxing Township, Cao Shuyun, who, with the help of the district grain station, rebuilt a 50-square-meter house in just over a month and have moved into their new home.
