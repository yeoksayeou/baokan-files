    Villagers' Meetings Should Not Be Neglected
    "To educate farmers, the primary issue is to have a platform, and in rural areas, the main platform is the villagers' meeting. However, in recent years, such meetings have been neglected. This is a prominent issue currently prevalent in many rural areas."

    Ju County, Aiguo Village Party Branch Secretary, first to sixth session National People's Congress representative, and renowned labor model Lü Hongbin has been a village branch secretary for forty years. He has deep insights into the rise and fall of rural areas. He said, "There is a saying that our Communist Party has too many meetings, of course, too many is not good, but having no meetings is also not good. In the past, we relied on villagers' meetings to carry out land reform and struggle against landlords. After liberation, we also relied on villagers' meetings to mobilize farmers to carry out production and construction, and to engage in political struggles. Therefore, such meetings are a very good form for inspiring, organizing, and educating farmers."

    Lü Hongbin said, "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's words are so sharp. In recent years, our biggest mistake is that we have not done enough to educate the people. This problem indeed exists in rural areas. After the responsibility system, the land was allocated to households, and some village cadres almost abandoned the villagers' meetings. They went to the county and township to attend meetings, and those with a strong sense of responsibility spoke a few words into the microphone, while some simply 'embezzled' the meetings. As for the farmers, they were like 'deaf people watching a play, hearing no sound at all.'"

    He said, "There is another problem: in recent years, village cadres have not focused on ideological work. Even when they hold villagers' meetings, they only discuss things like grain collection, levies, cremation, and family planning. However, meetings specifically for ideological education, praising good people and good deeds, and combating bad practices and evil trends are very rare. Now, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out the problem, which has shown us village cadres the direction for our future work: to grasp economic construction with one hand and ideological education with the other. As village cadres, we should review the past, think about the future, and from now on, through various forms, conduct socialist and patriotic ideological education for farmers. And villagers' meetings are an effective good form, which must not be neglected."

    不该受冷落的村民会
    “对农民进行教育，首要的问题是要有一个阵地，而农村起主要作用的阵地就是村民会议，但近几年这种会议被冷落了。这是当前广大农村普遍存在的突出问题。”
    莒县爱国村党支部书记、一至六届全国人大代表、著名劳动模范吕鸿宾当了四十年的村支部书记，对农村的兴衰进退，有着深刻的体会。他说，有句话，说我们共产党的会多，当然太多不好，但没有会也不行。过去，我们靠村民会闹土改斗地主，解放后也是靠村民会议发动农民开展生产建设，进行政治斗争的。因此，这种会议对鼓动农民、组织农民、教育农民，都是一种很好的形式。
    吕鸿宾说，小平同志说得多么尖锐，近几年我们最大的失误是对人民的教育不够。在农村也确实存在这个问题。大包干后，土地到了户，有些村干部几乎把村民会放弃了。他们到县里、乡里开了会，责任心强的对着麦克风说几句，有的干脆“贪污”了。农民呢，就是“聋子看戏，什么动静也听不着”了。
    他说，还有一个问题，就是这几年的村干部不抓思想工作，就是开起村民会，也是交粮啦、提留啊、火化呀、计划生育之类的，而专门进行思想教育，表扬好人好事，打击歪风邪气的村民会议，却很少。现在小平同志点出了问题，为我们村干部今后的工作指明了方向，就是一手抓经济建设，一手抓思想教育。作为村干部，要回顾过去，思考未来，从现在起，通过各种形式，对农民进行社会主义、爱国主义思想教育。而村民会议，是一种行之有效的好形式，千万忽视不得。
