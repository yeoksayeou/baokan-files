	Alphai Emphasizes that Only by Following the Socialist Path Can Tibet Have a Bright Future

	Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 18th - (Reporter Duoji Zhuanbei) Alphai Alphai Jinmei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, concluded his two-month inspection tour of Tibet and flew back to Beijing today. Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Pabala Gelengjie, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and other leaders went to the airport to see him off.

	During his stay in Tibet, as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress, Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Jinmei presided over the second session of the Fifth Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress and delivered a lengthy speech, objectively and comprehensively recounting the historical evolution of Tibet, further exposing the so-called "Tibet independence" and its causes and effects.

	He said that since 1987, only a very small number of people have been advocating "Tibet independence," while the vast majority of Tibetan people are opposed to independence. Therefore, the Dalai Lama should completely abandon the idea of "independence" and have a sincere dialogue with the central government, returning to the embrace of the motherland. No matter where, advocating "Tibet independence" will not have a good outcome.

	Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Jinmei pointed out that the nearly forty years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet have proven that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the Tibetan people become masters of their own destiny and live a happy life; only by following the socialist path can Tibet have a bright future. He urged all cadres in the autonomous region to emulate the good work style of the cadres who entered Tibet in the 1950s, better implement the party's policies and guidelines for Tibet, and lead the people of the entire region to build Tibet's socialist spiritual and material civilization.

	Nearly eighty-year-old Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Jinmei, despite the hardships of travel, specially visited the Jyekundo region, more than 350 kilometers away from Lhasa, and paid his respects to the relics of the Panchen Lama. He wished for the early reincarnation of the Panchen Lama's soul child.

	In Lhasa, Alphai Alphai Jinmei visited the martial law troops and the armed police, highly praising the martial law troops for strictly implementing the martial law order of the State Council and the party's ethnic policies, which won the support and love of the Tibetan people.

　　阿沛在西藏视察时强调
　　只有走社会主义道路西藏才能有光明前途
    新华社拉萨九月十八日电  （记者多吉占堆）全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美结束了对西藏为期两个月的视察工作，今天乘飞机离开拉萨回北京。西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛、全国政协副主席帕巴拉·格列朗杰等领导前往机场送行。
    在藏期间，作为西藏自治区人大常委会主任，阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长主持召开了自治区五届人大二次会议，并在会上作了长篇讲话，客观、全面地讲述了西藏的历史沿革，进一步揭穿了所谓
  “西藏独立”的前因后果。
    他说，从一九八七年开始叫嚣“西藏独立”的只是极少数人，而广大的藏族人民是反对独立的。所以，达赖喇嘛应当完全放弃“独立”的想法，同中央坦诚对话，回到祖国的怀抱里。不管在任何地方，搞“西藏独立”，都不会有好的结果。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长指出，从西藏和平解放以来近四十年的事实证明，只有共产党的领导，西藏人民才能当家作主，过上幸福的生活；只有走社会主义道路，西藏才有光明前途。他要求全自治区广大干部要树立五十年代进藏干部那样好的作风，更好地执行党对西藏的各项方针、政策，带领全区人民搞好西藏社会主义精神文明和物质文明建设。
    年近八旬的阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长不辞旅途之劳，还专程前往离拉萨三百五十多公里外的日喀则地区视察，并且瞻仰了班禅大师的法体。祝愿班禅大师的转世灵童早日降生。
    在拉萨，阿沛·阿旺晋美看望了戒严部队和武警部队，高度赞扬戒严部队严格执行国务院戒严令和党的民族政策，受到了西藏人民的拥护和爱戴。
