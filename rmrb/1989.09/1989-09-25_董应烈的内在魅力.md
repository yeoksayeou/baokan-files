The inner charm of Dong Yinglie

A person's charm is multifaceted, but Dong Yinglie is someone who possesses inner charm.

Dong Yinglie is a translator at the China International Travel Service. In 1985, he went to Japan for temporary work. Although he did not inform any of his Japanese friends, the news still spread among many Japanese who had toured China. Groups of Japanese people came to visit him. Japanese Senator Teng Yi Hengnan was very upset that he had not been informed in time and complained to a Chinese Japanese translator, "Mr. Dong was in Japan for four or five months without telling me, what a pity!"

Why does an ordinary translator hold such a position in the hearts of so many Japanese people?

From an external perspective, 54-year-old Dong Yinglie is indeed quite ordinary: he has a black, thin, and medium build, with wrinkles beginning to appear at the corners of his eyes and on his forehead. However, he has inner charm, and within his chest, there is a surging friendship from a Chinese person towards foreign guests.

Dong Yinglie originally worked in primary and secondary education in Northeast China. In the early 1960s, he was transferred to the China International Travel Service to work as a Japanese and Korean translator. To become a qualified translator, Old Dong pays attention to collecting newspaper and magazine materials, listening to the radio, and learning about various aspects of his country's customs, rivers and mountains, famous scenic spots, and historical sites. His skills have become increasingly proficient, and Japanese and Korean tourists who encounter Dong Yinglie as their translator and guide feel as if they have opened a Chinese encyclopedia.

Every morning when the tour group sets off, Dong Yinglie first greets the guests on the bus, and the guests jokingly say, "The international radio station has started broadcasting again." Then Old Dong begins to report domestic and international news to the guests. His oral "reporting" is lively and unique. For example, when accompanying a Japanese group, he would "report" recent news in Japan: the China-Japan Go tournament; China will send ballet dancers to Japan to study; and so on. Each piece of news reported would be met with a round of applause in the car.

If Dong Yinglie's extensive knowledge as a guide attracts foreign tourists, then his diligence and enthusiasm are the main reasons for his inner charm.

Last June, Dong Yinglie accompanied the Japan Ibaraki Prefecture Friendship Delegation from Shenyang to Jilin for a visit. Unfortunately, on the day the tour group was about to depart, 20 out of the 60 members suffered from diarrhea. The doctor advised the patients to recover in Shenyang before setting off, but they insisted on leaving. Reluctantly, the group had to vacate all the available soft seats for the patients to lie down, while the healthy ones had to sit in the aisles. Dong Yinglie, as the accompanying translator, suffered even more, as he did not even have a place in the aisle. In this way, he caught a cold. According to the scheduled itinerary, the tour group had only one day to visit Jilin. To avoid affecting the group's enthusiasm, Dong Yinglie, despite his illness, accompanied them cheerfully throughout the day.

Dong Yinglie is an old party member. His strict self-discipline is another manifestation of his inner charm. In recent years, the unhealthy trends in society have spread to the tourism industry, with incidents of private acceptance of "kickbacks" and "tips" occurring frequently. However, Dong Yinglie is never swayed by money. He believes that a Communist Party member must be able to withstand the tests of reform and opening up, and the test of money. Once, Dong Yinglie accompanied a Japanese tour group, and along the way, he helped them solve many problems. Especially, a few guests in the group needed acupuncture every night, and Dong Yinglie, despite his daytime fatigue, accompanied the guests for acupuncture until eleven or twelve o'clock. When leaving, the group leader handed him a stack of money and said, "This is the heartfelt gift from the entire group." However, Dong Yinglie smiled and declined, saying, "The best souvenir is the friendship between our two peoples."

This is the character of a Chinese translator. Some people say, "Old Dong is too naive. If you keep doing this, you will never get anything in your life." But Dong Yinglie says, "What I seek is the reputation of the nation and the character of a Communist Party member."

    董应烈的内在魅力
    本报记者　王　谨
    一个人的魅力是多方面的，而董应烈却是一个有着内在魅力的人。
    董应烈是中国国际旅行社总社翻译。1985年，他去日本做临时性工作，尽管没有告诉任何一个日本朋友，但消息还是在众多来华旅游过的日本人中传开了，成群的日本人来拜访他。日本参议员滕井恒男先生没有及时得知消息而很生气，向中国的一个日语翻译抱怨说：“董先生在日本四五个月没有告诉我，太遗憾了！”
    一个普通的翻译，为什么在众多的日本人心目中占有这样的位置呢？
    从外在形象看，54岁的董应烈确实很平常：黑而瘦的中等身材，眼角和额头已开始爬上皱纹。然而他有内在的魅力，在他的胸膛里奔涌着一个中国人对外国客人的友好感情。
    董应烈原在东北从事中小学教育工作，60年代初调到中国国际旅行社总社担任日语和朝语翻译。为了使自己成为一个合格的翻译，老董平时很注意收集报刊资料，收听广播，学习掌握祖国各地的风俗民情、山川河流、名胜古迹等各方面的知识。他的业务愈来愈纯熟了，日本、朝鲜游客遇上董应烈为他们当翻译导游，就像打开了一本中国的百科全书。
    每天早晨旅行团出发时，董应烈在汽车上首先向客人道早安，客人风趣地说：“国际广播电台又开始广播了”。接着老董就开始向客人报道国内外新闻。他这种口头“报道”生动活泼，别有特色。比如陪日本团，他就“报道”日本近日新闻：中日围棋赛；中国将派芭蕾舞演员去日本学习；如此等等。每报道一件新闻，车里就响起一片掌声。
    如果说，董应烈广博的导游知识，使他对外国游客产生一种吸引力的话，那么他的勤奋和热情，则是他产生内在魅力的主要动因。
    去年6月，董应烈陪日本茨城县友好访华团从沈阳到吉林参观。不料旅行团临行那天，他们60人中有20人闹腹泻，医生劝告患者在沈阳治好病再动身，但他们执意要走。无奈，团里只得将不多的软座全腾出来让患者躺着，其他健康者则只好坐在过道里。而作为陪团翻译的董应烈则更苦，他连过道的位置都没有。就这样，他患了感冒。而按预定的日程，旅行团在吉林只有一天的参观时间。为不影响旅行团的兴致，董应烈硬是带病有说有笑地一陪到底。
    董应烈是一名老党员。严于律己，是他内在魅力的又一表现。近些年来，社会上的不正之风蔓延到了旅游界，私收“回扣”和“小费”的事常常发生，但董应烈从不为金钱所动。他认为，共产党员一定要经得住改革、开放的考验，经得住金钱的考验。一次，董应烈陪一个日本旅行团，一路上帮他们解决不少困难。特别是团中有几个客人每天晚上都要针灸，董应烈不顾白天的疲劳，陪客人针灸到十一二点。出境时，团长拿出一叠钱对董应烈说：“这是全团的心意”。可董应烈笑着谢绝道：“最好的纪念是我们两国人民的友谊。”
    这就是一位中国翻译的情操。有人说：“老董太傻了，你这样干下去，一辈子也得不到什么。”可董应烈却说：“我所求的是民族的声誉和一个共产党员的品格。”
