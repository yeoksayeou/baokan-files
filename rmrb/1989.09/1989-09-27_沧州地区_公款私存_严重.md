Recently, relevant departments investigated 56 savings institutions in the Cangzhou region of Hebei Province and found that 77.58 million yuan of public funds had been transferred into personal savings accounts, accounting for 51% of the new savings deposits. The interest from these public funds has largely flowed into individual pockets. The main manifestations are as follows:

Bank employees engage in savings agency services. For example, the accounting, credit, planning, and cashier departments of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Haixing County all established savings agency offices for bank employees. Just in the first half of this year, the accounting department's agency office found 8.84 million yuan of public funds stored privately, which accounted for 58% of the total savings deposits. The eight savings agency personnel in the accounting department received 5,075 yuan in agency fees.

Forcibly intercepting enterprise settlement funds. For instance, the savings office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Cang County transferred 158,000 yuan of construction project funds from a construction enterprise into personal savings accounts for long-term storage.

Transferring budgetary and extra-budgetary funds of administrative and public institutions into savings. In February of this year, the savings office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Nanpi County transferred 2 million yuan allocated by the regional financial bureau to the county financial bureau into savings without notifying the receiving unit.

The "benefits" of public funds private storage for enterprises include: avoiding bank credit and settlement supervision, extracting cash, facilitating cash transactions; hiding business income, evading taxes.

For some individuals, public funds private storage can earn interest and agency fees, and some even use privately stored public funds as capital for embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and personal gain.

Public funds private storage also brings "benefits" to relevant banks: savings deposit tasks can be completed ahead of schedule and in excess, allowing for more contract bonuses, more savings agency fees, and more performance bonuses. Therefore, the attitude is "deposits are not questioned for their source, withdrawals are not questioned for their purpose," and public funds private storage is tolerated. Some even disregard national financial policies and the overall interests of the bank, forcibly pulling and mobilizing enterprises to store public funds privately.

    沧州地区“公款私存”严重
    最近，有关部门调查了河北沧州地区56个储蓄机构，发现公款转入私人储蓄的达775.8万元，占新增储蓄额的51％。公款私存的利息，大量流入了个人腰包。主要表现：
    银行职工搞储蓄代办。如海兴县工商银行会计股、信贷股、计划股、出纳股都设立了银行职工储蓄代办所。仅会计股代办所今年上半年吸储额中，查出公款私存的88.4万元，占吸储总额的58％。会计股8名储蓄代办人员提取代办费5075元。
    强行截留企业结算资金。如沧县工商银行储蓄所把建设企业的15.8万元工程款以个人名义长期转入储蓄。
    将行政事业单位的预算内、外资金转入储蓄。南皮县工商银行储蓄所于今年2月将地区财政局下拨县财政局的20万元，在未通知收款单位的情况下，擅自转入储蓄。
    公款私存给企业带来的“好处”是：能逃避银行信贷监督和结算监督，能套取现金，方便现金交易；隐瞒经营收入，偷漏税款。
    对某些个人来说，公款私存能谋取利息、代办费，有的甚至将私存公款作为贪污行贿、套购倒卖、损公肥私的资本。
    公款私存也给有关银行带来“好处”：储蓄存款任务能提前超额完成，可多提承包金、多提储蓄代办费、多分奖金。故
  “存款不问来源、取款不问用途”，对公款私存听之任之。更有甚者，有的置国家金融政策、银行整体利益于不顾，强拉、动员企业公款私存。　河北沧州市　仓济伴
