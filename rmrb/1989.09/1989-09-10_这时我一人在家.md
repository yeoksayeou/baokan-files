A train passes by outside the window, its rumbling sound fills me with a sense of dynamic fullness. I stand up from my desk and realize that I have gradually become accustomed to this peaceful daytime: few people in the building are likely to be at home—dual-income households have long since left with their lunch boxes, rushing to work on their bicycles; retired elderly people mostly go to the riverside to relax. The good time around eight o'clock in the morning gives me harmony, the bright sunlight slants into the room, accompanied by the chirping of birds in the trees. The early summer morning is like a glass of iced drink, offering you a refreshing coolness and a comfortable heart. But how lively it will be in the evening, just the sound of hurried bicycle bells returning from work is enough to make your heart flutter for half a day: is that Mom coming back? Oh, it sounds a bit like Dad’s footsteps, but it’s always a mistake, after all, it’s been several months since he was last home. Never mind, just listening to the greetings exchanged between neighbors who haven’t seen each other for a day is enough to make you feel warm and friendly.

“Xiao Shang, you’re back from work.”

“Yeah, I’m back. The weather is getting hotter, so the working hours need to be adjusted. Oh, come on over if you have nothing to do.”

“Sure, sure, I’ll come by if I have nothing to do.” People seem very busy, so I especially look forward to the evening.

Someone is talking downstairs. Because it has been so quiet around here for so long, I pay special attention. Today is Tuesday, who could have finished talking about the weekend’s news yesterday and have so much to talk about today?

“Your chilies are growing quite well.”

“Well, it’s not worth the money saved on vegetables to water them with tap water, I just find something to do to keep from being bored, and it makes me feel happy.” One can tell from the tone that it is a retired person, afraid of the approaching sense of loss.

In front of the building, there is a sizable plot of land, and several families have made full use of it: turning the soil, watering, planting some daily vegetables like green onions. Mostly, it is people in their fifties and sixties doing the work. The joy of labor is even more intense than the joy of having three generations living together.

In the campus, I am often caught off guard by this sudden question: what is the meaning of life? In fact, philosophical debates have never strayed far from this theme, but the subtle nuances that can only be felt and not expressed in words do make me at a loss for words.

“How much pension do you get in a month?”

“Not bad, with living allowances and whatnot, it’s about eighty or ninety yuan.” When material desires are gradually encroaching, it is this elderly woman who emphasizes “spiritual happiness.” Her overflowing satisfaction not only dispels the vulgarity on ordinary people but also gives me great joy and comfort.

“Look, your digging action is so natural, this is the benefit of labor. Look at how many people are at home now, eating too much, enjoying too much, and then rushing to practice this and that, fearing illness and misfortune, fearing old age and obesity. In fact, those movements, if not done naturally, will not achieve the effect of exercise, but when you work, your hands and feet move naturally, and this small plot of land is easily tilled without much effort.”

I glance at an old worker in his fifties next to her, who is digging a new plot of land, showing no signs of weakness, and I am deeply convinced by the old woman’s profound insights on exercise, thus forgetting to ponder whether she is accustomed to hard work and frugality, or whether she still cannot understand the changes brought by the opening up. I remember thinking about the strong farmers in the fields, walking with wide and thick soles, walking with a hard body. If you tell them that exercising is to make them sweat, they might say you are foolish: it’s looking for trouble. Yes, modernized big cities and the countryside have their differences, and even the magical nature cannot shorten the distance between them. However, to an ignorant child, everything is the same, whether it is electronic games or frog swimming in the small river in front of the village, all are equally fresh.

Thinking this way, the voices of people around me continue. The clouds are thin, the wind is gentle, and I feel warm all over, although at this moment, I am the only one at home.

　　这时我一人在家
　　张琳
    窗外驶过一列客车，隆隆的奔驰声带给我动的充实。起身离开书桌，发觉自己渐渐习惯了这白日的安宁：整幢楼不会有多少人在家——双职工的一早就挟着饭盒，骑上自行车匆匆上路了；居闲的老人大多去河边养神。八点多的好时光赐给我和谐，明亮的阳光斜射进屋，伴着树丛里啾啾的鸟鸣，入夏的清晨像一杯冰冻的冷饮，送给你口的清凉，心的舒畅。但是，傍晚该有多热闹，那一串串急促晚归的车铃声就足以让你心动半天：是不是妈妈回来了？噢，有些像爸爸的脚步声，可总是判断失误，毕竟几个月不在家啦。何妨，只要听听一天没见到面的邻人间相互的几句寒暄便着实感到亲切。
      “小尚，你下班了。”
      “哎，回来啦。天开始热了，上班的时间要调整了。噢，没事过来坐。”
      “好，好，没事来。”人们好像很忙，于是，我特别盼望傍晚时分。
    楼下有人说话，因为周围许久的清静，所以有些在意。今天可是星期二，有谁在昨天刚讲完周末的新鲜，又有那许多好谈？
      “你种的辣椒长得还可以嘛。”
      “嗨，省的那点菜钱不够浇自来水的呢，找点事情做罢了，既不闷得慌，又落个精神快乐。”一听便知是已退休在家的，怕那会来的失落感。
    楼前有一片不小的空地，好几家都充分利用了起来：翻土，浇水，种点诸如葱之类的日常小菜。大多是五六十岁的中老年人在干，那劳动的乐趣甚至比抱了孙子孙女的三代同堂之乐还浓。
    在校园里，常被这突如其来的提问问得招架不住：活着有何意义？其实，哲学的思辩一直未曾稍离这个主题，只是那只可意会，不好言传的蕴藉，的确使我拙于言辞。
      “你这一个月能拿多少退休金？”
      “不少，加上生活补贴什么的也有八九十呢。”当如今物欲一寸寸进逼，还是这位强调“精神快乐”的老年妇女，她的溢于言表的满足，既扫了常人身上的猥琐，也给了我很大的欣喜和安慰。
      “瞧，你铲土的动作多自然，这真是劳动的好处。你看现在这么多人在家吃不完，享不够，又忙着去练这练那，怕病怕殃，怕老怕胖，其实呀，那些动作如果做得不自然，根本达不到锻炼的效果，可是干起活，手脚自动配合，这巴掌大的地锄锄不费力。”
    我转眼去瞧旁边一位50多岁的老工人，正在挖一块新地，丝毫没有力不从心之感，便很为老妇人那精辟的关于锻炼的独到之论折服，因此也忘了去琢磨她是不是勤劳、俭朴惯了；是不是还想不通开放带来的一些变化。记得自己也曾想到农田里辛苦耕耘的强壮的庄稼人，走宽的厚脚板，走硬的身子骨，如果告诉他们机械的练身就是要流汗，他们恐怕要说你傻：是找累受。是啊，文明的现代化大城市和农村之间有着它们的区别，神奇的大自然也不能缩短其间的距离。然而，对于无知的小孩子，什么都一样，无论电子游戏，还是村前小河里的蛙泳，都一样新鲜。
    这样想着，耳旁人语声依然。云儿也淡，风也轻，直觉得暖意盈盈，虽然这时，只我一人在家。
