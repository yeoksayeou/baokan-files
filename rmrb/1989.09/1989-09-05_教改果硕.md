Now, if you walk into some of the large hotels in Dalian, a coastal city in Liaoning Province, you will see graduates from two tourism vocational high schools in Dalian providing enthusiastic and skilled service. Many foreign guests praise that here, not only are there first-class service facilities, but also first-class service quality.

Now, if you go to Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County in the northwestern part of Liaoning Province, you will see some graduates from the county's veterinary and animal husbandry vocational high school. Some have set up veterinary clinics, some have established cattle and sheep improvement stations, and some have become specialized breeders. They are all actively applying their professional skills to serve the development of animal husbandry in the region.

Over the past 10 years, Liaoning Province has continuously reformed its secondary education structure and developed vocational and technical education. Currently, the enrollment numbers for various vocational and technical schools account for more than 55% of the total high school enrollment. They have already sent 599,000 graduates into society. These young people, who have specialized skills, are generally welcomed by their employers after entering society.

    教改果硕
    现在走进辽宁滨海名城大连市的一些大宾馆，都会见到大连市的两所旅游职业高中的毕业生在热情、熟练地服务。不少外宾称赞说：这里不仅有一流的服务设施，更有一流的服务质量。
    现在来到辽宁西北部偏僻的阜新蒙古族自治县，便会看到县畜牧兽医职业高中的一些毕业生，有的办兽医诊所，有的办牛羊改良站，有的成为饲养专业户，都在积极发挥所学的专长，为发展本地区的畜牧业服务。
    辽宁省10年来不断改革中等教育结构，发展职业技术教育。目前，各类中等职业技术学校的招生数，已占高中阶段招生总数的55％以上，并已向社会输送了59.9万名毕业生。这些学有专长的青年走上社会后，普遍受到用人单位的欢迎。　（李友林　张秀军）
