An outstanding leader in the political work of our army, a veteran Communist who joined the Party in its early days, a revolutionary of the proletariat, and a distinguished political worker in our army, Comrade Fu Zhong has left us forever. We are deeply grieved!

Comrade Fu Zhong was a seasoned and respected political worker. During the Red Army period, he served in various positions, including Division Political Commissar, Director of the Political Department of the Peng-Yang Military Academy, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Fourth Front Army, and Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Red Army University (later renamed the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University). He translated the Soviet Red Army Political Work Regulations, oversaw the formulation of detailed regulations for the political work of army, division, and regiment-level political organs, wrote the "Handbook for Company Political Instructors," and edited publications such as the "Red Army Newspaper" and "Essential Reading for Cadres." He participated in various aspects of the early political work of our army, accumulating rich experience, and made significant contributions to ensuring the completion of military construction and combat tasks in the Fourth Front Army. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, Comrade Fu Zhong was transferred to work at the General Political Department. From then until he left his leadership position at the General Political Department, spanning over forty years, he dedicated himself to the construction of the people's army and the political work of the army, pouring in a tremendous amount of effort and achieving remarkable results. He earned the love and respect of the General Political Department and the broad masses of officers and soldiers throughout the army. His brilliant achievements and noble character will forever be worth our remembrance and admiration.

After participating in the famous Luochuan Conference in August 1937, Comrade Fu Zhong joined the Eighth Route Army Political Department. He initially served as the Director of the Mass Mobilization Department, accompanying Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Director Ren Bishi, and Deputy Director Deng Xiaoping as they crossed the Yellow River, fought in the eastern and southwestern parts of Shanxi, and later moved to the Taihang Mountains. In January 1938, he took over from Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the Deputy Director of the Eighth Route Army Political Department and later became the Director of the Eighth Route Army Field Political Department. In the autumn of 1940, after returning to Yan'an, he served as the Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission. During the arduous years of establishing anti-Japanese democratic base areas, he conducted extensive mobilization of the masses, expanded the revolutionary united front, strengthened our army, united friendly forces, and weakened enemy forces. He carried out large-scale and effective ideological and political work to wage independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare in the rear areas. Particularly, he provided in-depth and meticulous guidance for the political consolidation of the troops on the North China front, achieving excellent results. During the War of Liberation, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission Liu Shaoqi served concurrently as the Director of the General Political Department. Comrade Fu Zhong assisted Comrade Liu Shaoqi in managing the daily work of the General Political Department. During the intense struggle to achieve national victory, he led the General Political Department, which had only about fifty cadres, to work in unison and strive hard, completing many important tasks entrusted by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Fu Zhong continued to serve as the Deputy Director of the General Political Department, overseeing propaganda and cultural work. In this new historical period, he did a great deal of work to promote Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In the 1950s, he lectured on the Marxist theory of class struggle at the full army theoretical training class and spoke about political work at military academies and other units, using the format of answering students' questions as the main teaching method. In the 1960s, he visited troops stationed in Beijing and Tianjin, lecturing on the formation, development, and fundamental views of Mao Zedong Thought to grassroots cadres and soldiers, receiving enthusiastic responses. Before and after the Cultural Revolution, he also published numerous articles discussing military construction and political work issues, fully demonstrating his high theoretical cultivation and work enthusiasm as a leader in political work.

During his leadership at the General Political Department, Comrade Fu Zhong insisted on using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, scientifically analyzing the situation and tasks of political work, and maintaining the correct direction. To this end, he emphasized that cadres must study the basic theories of Marxism, continuously improve their political level and theoretical cultivation. In his management of theoretical education work, he paid close attention to the formulation of cadre theoretical education plans, the cultivation of key personnel, and the implementation of related measures in the troops. At a theoretical education symposium in the 1950s, he pointed out that Marxism-Leninism itself has extremely rigorous scientific and systematic characteristics; the teaching policy should be "systematic, practical, and progressive." He warned everyone that theoretical learning should be gradual and not fragmentary, and that overly urgent demands are harmful and unachievable. This correct proposal was criticized during the Cultural Revolution as evidence against Lin Biao's so-called "30-character guideline" for studying Chairman Mao's works. He often educated cadres to focus on understanding the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, grasping their spirit and essence, and not to be satisfied with obtaining fragmented and scattered knowledge. He advocated learning Party history to study Mao Zedong Thought. His works "The Victory of Mao Zedong's Dialectics of Military Affairs" in the early 1960s and "Mao Zedong's Military Science is Forever a Treasure of the Chinese People" in the early 1980s are the results of his studies. These two works had a wide influence both inside and outside the military, especially the latter, in which he firmly pointed out that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has corrected the mistakes made by Comrade Mao Zedong in his later years, completely to restore the original face of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to and develop Mao Zedong Thought, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should not ignore the study of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's military science because Comrade Mao Zedong made mistakes in his later years; nor should we doubt or belittle the role of Mao Zedong's military science because of the development of modern military technology. Comrade Fu Zhong's discussions on these issues still have practical significance today for adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization.

Comrade Fu Zhong paid great attention to the construction of the Party within the army. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Red Army had just been reorganized into the Eighth Route Army, to ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the army and implement the policy of independent initiative, he led the Field Political Department to strongly resist Wang Ming's rightist proposal to abolish grassroots Party branches, maintaining the correct principle of "Party branches in every company." He strengthened and boldly developed Party organizations, doing a lot of pioneering work to improve the Party's combat effectiveness. Comrade Fu Zhong actively participated in and oversaw the drafting of the "Draft Regulations for Party Committees of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and the "Draft Regulations for Branch Work." These documents effectively ensured the soundness of the Party's organization and the unity of the leadership system throughout the army. He repeatedly educated broad masses of political workers in lectures and meetings to correctly understand the fundamental purpose of our army's political work, which is to ensure that the entire army implements the Party's program, line, and policies; and that Party construction within the army is the main content of political work. After 1982, during his tenure as a Standing Committee member of the Central Advisory Commission, he wrote important articles such as "Adhering to and Developing Mao Zedong's Theory of Party Building," deeply discussing the importance of building the Party ideologically, maintaining the organizational principle of democratic centralism, and creatively carrying out Party style construction, in conjunction with the rectification of the Party and the struggle against spiritual pollution at that time. As an old Communist Party member, Comrade Fu Zhong earnestly exhorted and hoped that all Party members would firmly hold the Communist faith, while adhering to reform and opening up, strive to strengthen their Party spirit, and bravely fight against corrupt ideologies within the Party. He was full of confidence in the Party's construction in the new historical period.

Comrade Fu Zhong believed that the political work of our army accumulated rich and valuable experience during the war years. We must work hard to combine it with the new situation and problems of modernizing and regularizing the troops, so that political work can continue to develop and improve. In 1954, at the request of Director Luo Ronghuan of the General Political Department, he was invited to the Nanjing Military Academy to lecture on political work courses to the political system students of the academy and representatives from various military regions and political organs of various military branches. This lecture systematically expounded on Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on people's armies and people's wars, and the basic issues of political work. He emphasized the important position and historical role of political work, reaffirmed that political work is the lifeline of our army, and clearly proposed that only by treating political work as a science to study and research can we overcome shortcomings and achieve new developments in political work. Comrade Fu Zhong's lecture had a wide influence throughout the army, playing an active guiding role in strengthening political work in the modernization and regularization construction of the troops and overcoming the erroneous ideas of neglecting and weakening political work.

Since the founding of the country, Comrade Fu Zhong has long been in charge of the army's cultural work, dedicating himself to the development of the army's cultural work and cultural teams, carrying forward the fine traditions formed during the revolutionary war years, and continuing to move forward in the correct direction. He was elected as the Vice Chairman of the third and fourth National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. As early as the first National Congress of Literature and Art in 1949, following the instructions of Comrade Zhou Enlai, he gave a report titled "On the Cultural Work of the Troops," systematically discussing the important achievements since the Red Army period, especially since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, and preliminarily summarizing the basic experience. He clearly proposed that the cultural work of the troops is not an optional but a necessary form of work and life, and is a component of political work in the troops. Its characteristics are: strong Party leadership; completely based on actual needs, serving the masses and the war; and having a broad mass base, being a collective activity throughout the army. His detailed argument for the fine tradition of carrying out combatant and mass cultural activities in our army has powerfully guided the prosperity and development of cultural work in the troops, making professional and amateur cultural work work together, playing a role in inspiring and educating the troops, and consolidating and improving the troops' combat effectiveness. In leading cultural work, Comrade Fu Zhong has always emphasized the need to understand and master the special laws of literature and art, actively implement the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, pushing the old to make way for the new, using the past to serve the present, and using foreign things to serve China"; to respect and cherish writers, artists, and artistic talents among the masses, guiding and encouraging them to go deep into life, truly integrate with the masses, and absorb the nourishment of thought and art. The numerous achievements of the August First Film Studio and the General Political Department's Drama Troupe, Dance Troupe, Opera Troupe, and the Liberation Army Literary and Art Society all have his heart and soul. He always cared about the cultural life of the companies and grassroots levels, vigorously advocating for small, diverse, and convenient art forms and organizational forms. In the 1950s, he supported Shandong fast-talking, a form of folk storytelling that the masses loved, making it quickly take root and blossom in the professional and amateur cultural teams throughout the army; in the 1960s, he encouraged cultural work teams that went deep into the coastal defenses, fully affirming their achievements and advanced experiences, etc., which are outstanding examples. He often said that evaluating the pros and cons of literature and art should first see if it can be understood and mastered by the masses, and secondly, see if it reflects the advanced thoughts and healthy emotions of the masses. His many discussions and proposals on literature and art are permeated with a clear Party stance and mass perspective, still inspiring and encouraging literary and art workers to strive for the prosperity of socialist literature and art.

Over the years, Comrade Fu Zhong has won the love and respect of the broad masses of officers and soldiers with his noble character. He has always put revolutionary interests first, consciously maintaining unity with the Party Central Committee in politics and actions, and considering the overall situation, working hard and without complaint. He was consistent in his words and deeds, open-hearted, strict with himself, and tolerant of others, never boasting of his merits or calculating personal gains and losses. He was always full of enthusiasm for his comrades and the masses, patiently listening to different opinions. He cared about the improvement of cadres and the growth of the younger generation; he cherished intellectuals, patiently guiding cultural workers to establish a Marxist view of literature and art. Comrade Fu Zhong vividly embodied the fine traditions of our Party in combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing. In 1945, he attended the Seventh National Congress of the Party and delivered a speech at the congress on maintaining the unity of the Party, which was sincere, profound, and full of passion, receiving praise from Comrade Mao Zedong and other attendees, leaving a deep impression on the high-level cadres of the Party and the army. In 1949, he attended the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and, after the meeting, he followed the Party's call to maintain the traditional style of being modest, honest, clean, and hardworking. After retiring from his leadership position, he still devoted his greatest energy to reading and studying, organizing and collecting past articles on the study of Mao Zedong Thought and summarizing political work experience, saying, "This is part of the work of passing on skills." He truly lived up to Comrade Zhou Enlai's advocacy: "Learn until old age, maintain the late style of a revolutionary."

Comrade Fu Zhong's life was a life of revolution and struggle. He set a high example and a model for learning for the broad masses of officers and soldiers, especially political workers, throughout the army. We should turn our grief into strength, inherit the unfinished work of him and the older generation of revolutionaries, and strive to strengthen the political work of our army, achieving greater victories in the construction of a modernized and regularized revolutionary army with practical actions!

Comrade Fu Zhong will live forever!

    我军杰出的政治工作领导者
    ——悼念傅钟同志
    解放军总政治部
    我党建党初期入党的久经考验的共产主义战士、无产阶级革命家、我军杰出的政治工作领导者傅钟同志，和我们永别了，我们深为悲痛！
    傅钟同志是一位资深望重的政治工作者。在红军时期，他历任师政委、彭（湃）杨（殷）军政干部学校政治部主任、红四方面军政治部副主任、中国人民抗日红军大学（后为抗日军政大学）政治部主任等职。他曾翻译苏联红军政治工作条例，主持制订军、师、团政治机关工作细则，撰写《连队指导员手册》等教材，并主编过《红军报》、《干部必读》等报刊。他参与了我军早期政治工作的多方面实践，积累了丰富的经验，在红四方面军中为保证完成建军、作战任务，作出了很大贡献。1937年抗日战争爆发后，傅钟同志调到总政治部工作，从那时起到离开总政领导岗位，共计四十余年。在此期间，他兢兢业业地为人民军队建设和军队政治工作建设，倾注了大量心血，取得显著成就，受到总政和全军广大指战员的爱戴与敬重。他的光辉业绩和崇高品德，永远值得我们追思和怀念。
    傅钟同志1937年8月参加了著名的洛川会议之后，到八路军政治部工作。开始任民运部长，随朱德总司令、任弼时主任、邓小平副主任等一起东渡黄河，转战晋东北、晋西南，尔后到太行山，1938年1月接替邓小平同志任八路军政治部副主任，后任八路军野战政治部主任。1940年秋到延安后，任中央军委总政治部副主任。他在创建敌后抗日民主根据地的艰苦岁月中，为广泛发动群众，扩展革命统一战线，为壮大我军，团结友军，瓦解敌军，开展独立自主的敌后游击战争，进行了大量卓有成效的思想政治工作。尤其是对华北前线各部队的政治整军，进行了深入细致的指导，取得了良好效果。解放战争时期，中共中央、中央军委副主席刘少奇同志兼任总政治部主任，他协助刘少奇同志主持总政日常工作。在夺取全国胜利的紧张斗争中，率领仅有五十多位干部的总政机关，步调一致，艰苦奋斗，完成了党中央、中央军委交办的许多重要任务。
    新中国成立后，傅钟同志继续担任总政治部副主任，主管宣传、文化工作。在新的历史时期，他为宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想做了大量工作。五十年代，他到全军理论集训班讲马克思主义的阶级斗争学说，到部队院校等单位讲政治工作，并把回答学员的问题作为授课的基本形式。六十年代，他深入到驻京、津部队，为基层干部、战士讲解毛泽东思想的形成、发展和基本观点，受到热烈欢迎。在“文革”之前和以后，他还多次发表文章论述军队建设和政治工作问题，充分体现了作为政治工作领导者高度的理论修养和工作热情。
    傅钟同志在总政领导工作中，坚持以马列主义、毛泽东思想为指导，科学分析政治工作的形势与任务，保持正确的方向。为此，他强调干部必须学习马克思主义基本理论，不断提高政治水平和理论修养。他在主管理论教育工作中，对干部理论教育规划的制订，骨干的培养，及有关措施在部队的落实都抓得很紧。在五十年代一次学校理论教育座谈会上，他指出，马列主义理论本身有极其严密的科学性、系统性；教学方针应该是“系统的，联系实际的，稳步前进的”。他告诫大家，理论学习要循序渐进，不要断章取义，不能像“立竿见影”那样，过分性急的要求是无益的，办不到的。他这个正确主张，在“文革”中却成了反对林彪所谓学习毛泽东著作的“三十字方针”的“罪证”而遭受批判。他经常教育干部要注重领会马列主义基本原理，掌握其精神实质，决不要以获得片断的、零碎的知识为满足。他提倡通过学习党史学习毛泽东思想。他在六十年代初写的《毛泽东军事辩证法的胜利》，八十年代初写的《毛泽东军事科学永远是中国人民之瑰宝》，就是他学习的成果。这两篇著作在军内外有广泛影响，尤其是后一篇著作，他坚定地指出，党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党纠正毛泽东同志晚年的错误，完全是为了恢复毛泽东思想的本来面目，坚持和发展毛泽东思想，建设有中国特色的社会主义。我们不能因为毛泽东同志晚年有错误，而忽视对毛泽东思想、毛泽东军事科学的学习；也不能因为现代军事技术的发展，而怀疑、贬低毛泽东军事科学的作用。傅钟同志的这些论述，对我们今天坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，仍富有现实意义。
    傅钟同志极为重视军队中党的建设。抗日战争开始，红军刚刚改编为八路军时，为保证党对军队的绝对领导，贯彻独立自主方针，他率领野战政治部有力地抵制了王明旨在取消党的基层支部的右倾主张，维护了“支部建在连上”的正确原则；大力巩固、大胆发展党的组织，为提高党的战斗力，做了许多富有开拓意义的工作。傅钟同志积极参与和主持制订《中国人民解放军党委会条例（草案）》、《支部工作条例（草案）》。这些文件，有效地保证了全军党的组织的健全和领导制度的统一。他多次在讲课、会议中教育广大政工干部，要正确认识我军政治工作的根本目的，是保证全军贯彻执行党的纲领、路线、政策；在军队中进行党的建设工作，是政治工作的主要内容。1982年后，他在担任中顾委常委期间，又撰写了题为《坚持并发展毛泽东的建党学说》等重要文章，对于着重从思想上建设党，维护民主集中制的组织原则，创造性地进行党的作风建设等重要问题，结合当时的整党和反对精神污染的斗争，作了深刻论述。作为老共产党员，傅钟同志语重心长地勉励和希望全体党员同志要坚定共产主义信念，在坚持改革、开放的同时，努力增强党性，勇敢地和党内某些组织中的腐化思想作斗争。他对新的历史时期的党的建设，充满了胜利信心。
    傅钟同志认为，我军政治工作在战争年代积累的经验极其丰富而宝贵。要下功夫结合部队现代化、正规化建设的新形势、新问题，使政治工作继续发展提高。1954年，他受总政罗荣桓主任委托，应邀到南京军事学院，向该院政治系学员和各大军区、各军兵种政治机关派出的代表讲授政治工作课程。这次讲课，系统地阐述了毛泽东同志关于人民军队、人民战争的学说和政治工作的基本问题。他强调政治工作的重要地位和历史作用，重申政治工作是我军的生命线，明确提出只有把政治工作当作科学来看待、来研究，才能克服缺点，使政治工作有新的发展。傅钟同志这次讲课，在全军产生了广泛影响，对于加强部队现代化正规化建设中的政治工作，克服轻视和削弱政治工作的错误观念，起到了积极的指导作用。
    建国以来，傅钟同志长期主管军队文艺工作，为我军文艺工作和文艺队伍发扬革命战争年代形成的优良传统，继续沿着正确的方向前进，付出了艰辛劳动。他曾被选为第三届和第四届中国文联副主席。早在1949年的全国第一次文代会上，他遵照周恩来同志的指示，作了题为《关于部队的文艺工作》的报告，系统地论述了自红军时期开始，特别是1942年毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以来的重要成就，初步总结了基本经验。明确提出：部队文艺工作不是可有可无的，而是必要的一种工作形式和生活形式，是部队政治工作的组成部分。其特点是：有党的坚强领导；完全从实际需要出发，服务于群众，服务于战争；有广大群众性，是全军上下整体的活动。他对我军开展战斗性群众性文艺活动优良传统的详实论证，有力地指导了部队文艺工作的繁荣和发展，使专业、业余的文艺工作拧成一股劲，为活跃部队生活和思想工作，巩固与提高部队战斗力，发挥了鼓舞、教育作用。傅钟同志在领导文艺工作中还一贯强调，必须了解和掌握文艺的特殊规律，积极贯彻百花齐放、推陈出新、古为今用、洋为中用的正确方针；要尊重和爱护作家、艺术家以及群众中的艺术人才，引导和鼓励他们深入生活，真正与群众相结合，汲取思想与文艺的营养。八一电影制片厂和总政话剧团、歌舞团、歌剧团、解放军文艺社等文艺单位所取得的累累硕果，都有他的心血浇灌其中。他时刻关心连队、基层的文艺生活，大力提倡小型多样、轻便易行的艺术形式及组织形式。在五十年代，他支持山东快书这种群众喜闻乐见的说唱艺术，使之很快在全军专业和业余的文艺队伍中生根开花；在六十年代，他鼓励那些深入海边防的文化工作队，充分肯定他们的成绩和先进经验，等等，都是突出的事例。他多次说过，评论文艺的好坏得失，一要看文艺是否能被群众理解和掌握，二要看它是否反映群众的先进思想和健康的感情。他的许多关于文艺的论述和主张，贯穿着鲜明的党性立场和群众观点，至今仍启迪、鼓舞着文艺工作者为繁荣社会主义文艺而努力奋斗。
    多年来，傅钟同志以其崇高品德赢得了广大指战员的爱戴和尊敬。他一贯以革命利益为重，自觉地在政治上、行动上与党中央保持一致，顾全大局，任劳任怨。他言行一致，襟怀坦白，严于律己，宽以待人，从不居功自傲，不计较个人得失。他对同志、对群众总是满腔热情，耐心听取不同意见。他关心干部的提高，关心青年一代的成长；他爱护知识分子，循循善诱地帮助文艺工作者树立马克思主义的文艺观。在傅钟同志身上，生动地体现了我党的理论联系实际、密切联系群众和批评自我批评的优良作风。1945年他出席党的七大，在大会上所作的关于维护党的团结的发言，诚恳、深刻而且充满激情，受到了毛泽东等到会同志的赞扬，在党和军队的高级干部中留下了深刻的印象。1949年他列席党的七届二中全会，会后他对党的号召身体力行，一直保持着谦虚谨慎、清正廉洁、艰苦奋斗的传统作风。他退出领导岗位以后，仍然以最大的精力看书学习，整理、汇集过去论述毛泽东思想和总结政治工作经验的文章，说“这就是传帮带的一部分工作”。他真正做到了周恩来同志倡导的：活到老学习到老，保持革命家的晚节。
    傅钟同志的一生，是革命的一生，战斗的一生。他为全军广大指战员特别是政治工作者树立了崇高的形象和学习的榜样。我们要化悲痛为力量，继承他和其老一辈革命家未竟的事业，努力加强我军的政治工作，以实际行动夺取现代化正规化革命军队建设的更大胜利！
    傅钟同志永垂不朽！
