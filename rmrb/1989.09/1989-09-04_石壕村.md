    Stone Village
    Have you seen it? There, there… the low-lying land to the north of the road is the Stone Village that Du Fu wrote about. How many dynasties have risen and fallen? It still stands proudly on the earth. The rooster's crow at dawn replaces the midnight howls of dogs. The blood-stained clubs have rotted into dust. The Stone Village official has long turned to ash. The flames of war have dissipated, and the gunpowder smoke has cleared. What covers the earth now is the blue sky and green foliage.

    From the fields where corn is harvested, a handsome youth runs towards us. No! This is not the grandson of the old woman. He should be the descendant of the old woman's many generations later. He laughs with the glorious sunlight, like a plate of sunflowers stretching over the short fence. He is no longer the pitiful sight in others' eyes. He stands at the head of the village, gazing at the world, watching us, the tourists in our car, singing and traveling through the dust.
