    Laying a Solid Foundation and Standing Firm as a Rock
    – Notable Achievements in the Construction of Our Military's Grassroots Units

    The "Regulations for the Construction of Grassroots Units in the Military" – this small book, which appears thin but contains the collective wisdom of the entire military, has been issued and implemented as the guideline for grassroots construction and work at the grassroots level in the new situation. Over the past year, it has promoted the overall improvement of grassroots units.

    In late August, when the reporter inquired about the situation of the military's grassroots units fully implementing the "Regulations," the responsible person from the General Political Department's Organization Department, who evaluates the situation of the troops with caution, believed that using simple numbers to present the overall picture of grassroots construction may not be convincing, and many achievements in grassroots construction are not easily quantifiable. However, he optimistically said that after the "Regulations" were implemented, through the joint efforts of all levels, hard work, and arduous struggle, the overall level of grassroots units in the entire military has been significantly improved, and the construction of grassroots units has shown a gratifying trend of steady development. In summary, it is reflected in the significant enhancement of combat effectiveness in various aspects of grassroots construction. The most recent evidence can be found in the recent severe period: many units from various places, which to a certain extent are a microcosm of our military, were able to excellently carry out martial law and riot control tasks, and withstand the test of blood and fire. A crucial factor is that they have laid a solid foundation through comprehensive and solid construction in peacetime.

    In June of last year, the "Regulations," approved by the Military Commission and formulated by the three general departments, were issued to the entire military for trial implementation. The implementation of the "Regulations" at the grassroots level has brought about changes in many aspects. One of the most notable is the significant improvement in the political awareness of officers and soldiers. Various levels have conducted military knowledge education, patriotism and current affairs policy education, and ideological and moral education for the troops. They have strengthened the education of cadres and soldiers to adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and carry out regular ideological work, making the troops highly stable and unified. The vast majority of grassroots officers and soldiers have maintained a firm and correct political direction. In the face of reform and adjustment of interests, they consider the overall situation and do not calculate personal gains and losses; in the implementation of the three regulations for cadre work and the conferment of ranks on soldiers, they correctly handle honors and benefits; in disaster relief, they bravely rush forward; in the Old Mountain front and the South China Sea struggle, they sacrifice for the motherland. Especially in the special political struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, they stood firm, held high the banner, and resolutely followed the Party's command, demonstrating a high level of political awareness of "the interests of the motherland are above all, and for the motherland, everything is sacrificed." They have established and carried forward the spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" with distinctive characteristics of the times, and have produced a group of heroes represented by Liu Guangen, Cui Guozheng, and Ma Guoxuan.

    The combat fortress role of grassroots party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members have been significantly enhanced. This is the result of various units strengthening the construction of grassroots party organizations according to the requirements of the "Regulations." Grassroots party organizations in the entire military are generally sound, and their ability to solve their own problems and lead comprehensive construction is gradually improving. The number of new party members has been effectively controlled, and the composition of party members has been significantly improved. Democratic evaluation of party members has become institutionalized and effective. Whether in peacetime or in critical moments, as long as there is party organization activity, the troops have cohesion. In recent years, among the personnel who have received various awards in the entire military, party members account for 60%. More than 90% of the heroes and models awarded titles by the Central Military Commission and various large units are party members.

    According to the General Political Department's Organization Department, last year, nearly half of the grassroots units and units in the entire military reached the standard. This indicates that the standard-reaching activities with the 6 standards uniformly stipulated by the "Regulations" as the goal have effectively stimulated the collective sense of honor and the spirit of striving for progress among officers and soldiers, and the internal vitality of the units has been brought into play.

    In the face of limited military funds and rising prices, various levels have, on the one hand, ensured the needs of grassroots units in budget arrangements, and on the other hand, used a considerable part of the production income to solve practical problems for grassroots units, improving the material and cultural life of grassroots units. Last year, the various large units of the entire military collectively "squeezed out" more than 100 million yuan from the budget revenue to be used in grassroots units.

### 打好基础　坚如磐石——我军基层建设成绩显著

    打好基础　坚如磐石
    ——我军基层建设成绩显著
    本报讯　《军队基层建设纲要》——这本看上去很薄却是集中了全军同志智慧的小册子，作为新形势下基层建设和抓基层工作的准则，颁发试行一年来，促进了基层整体水平的提高。
    8月下旬，当记者问及我军基层全面贯彻落实《纲要》的状况时，对部队形势评估持慎重态度的总政组织部负责人认为，用简单的数字来展现基层建设全貌不一定令人信服，基层建设取得的许多成就也不宜量化显示。但是，他乐观地说，《纲要》试行后，经过上下一致努力，艰苦奋斗，全军基层整体水平有了新的提高，基层建设呈现出稳步发展的喜人形势。归结到一点，就是能够综合反映各项工作，体现在基层建设各个方面的战斗力有了显著加强。最新的例证，可以从刚刚过去的那段严峻日子里找到：许多来自各方、在一定程度上是我军缩影的连队，之所以能够出色执行戒严和平暴任务，经受住血与火的考验，很关键的一条就是平时扎扎实实进行全面建设，打下了好基础。
    去年6月，经军委批准由三总部制定的《纲要》下发全军试行。《纲要》在基层的贯彻，带来了多方面的变化。标志之一就是官兵的政治觉悟有了新的提高。各级认真对部队进行军人常识教育、爱国主义和时事政策教育、理想道德教育，加强对干部战士进行坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的教育和经常性思想工作，使部队高度稳定和统一，广大基层官兵保持了坚定正确的政治方向。在改革利益调整面前，能顾大局，不计个人得失；在实行干部工作三个条例和士兵授衔中，正确对待荣誉、待遇；在抢险救灾中，赴汤蹈火，奋勇当先；在老山前线和南沙斗争中为祖国舍生忘死。尤其在平息反革命暴乱这场特殊政治斗争中，做到立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决听从党指挥，表现出“祖国利益高于一切，为了祖国舍得一切”的高度政治觉悟，树立和弘扬了具有时代特征的“共和国卫士”精神，涌现出以刘国庚、崔国政、马国选等一批基层干部战士为代表的英雄人物。
    基层党支部战斗堡垒作用和党员先锋模范作用明显增强。这是各部队按照《纲要》的要求，加强基层党组织建设的结果。全军基层党组织普遍健全，解决自身问题的能力和领导全面建设的能力逐步提高，发展党员数量得到了有效控制，党员的构成明显改善，民主评议党员形成制度并且效果显著。无论在平时，还是在关键时刻，只要有党组织活动，部队就有了凝聚力。近几年，全军受到各种奖励的人员中，党员占60％。被中央军委和各大单位授予称号的英模人物90％以上是党员。
    据总政组织部透露，去年，全军有近半数的基层连队和单位达标，这说明以《纲要》统一规定的6条标准为目标的达标活动，有力地激发了干部战士“连兴我荣、连衰我耻”的集体荣誉感和奋发进取的精神，连队的内在活力得到了发挥。
    在军费有限、物价上涨的情况下，各级一方面注意在预算安排上保障基层的需要，另一方面又把生产收益的相当一部分用于为基层解决实际问题，使基层的物质文化生活有了改善。去年，全军各大单位本级共从预算收入中“抠”出上亿元钱用到基层。（赵明）
