The Central Military Commission has approved a decision by the General Staff Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army to invite a group of outstanding individuals from the grassroots level of the troops who have made significant contributions to troop construction to Beijing to participate in the celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The reporter learned from relevant departments of the General Political Department that in recent years, all military units across the army have diligently implemented the instructions of the Central Military Commission on strengthening grassroots construction and have effectively carried out work in accordance with the "Regulations on Grassroots Construction in the Military." Overall grassroots construction has made significant progress. Officers and soldiers who have long been working and living at the grassroots level, especially those who have been fighting for many years on the border, islands, and highlands, have dedicated their youth to the motherland and made great contributions to grassroots construction in the troops. This time, the three general departments of the PLA have invited their representatives to Beijing to participate in the 40th anniversary celebrations, which is both an honor for them and an encouragement for the entire army.

It is understood that the party committees and political organs of all major units across the army are using a combination of leadership and mass methods to recommend representatives at each level.

After arriving in Beijing, these representatives will hold a reporting meeting to share their experiences.
