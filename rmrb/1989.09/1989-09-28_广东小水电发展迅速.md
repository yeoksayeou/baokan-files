Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, small hydropower in Guangdong has developed rapidly. 98% of the townships and 80% of the farmers in the province now have access to electricity.

According to statistics from the water and electricity department, over the past 40 years, Guangdong has built 6,688 new hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of 2.52 million kilowatts. Small hydropower accounts for seven-tenths of this capacity. Last year, small hydropower generated 4.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. There are 64 counties in the province where small hydropower is the main source of electricity, and 59 counties where the installed capacity of small hydropower exceeds 10,000 kilowatts, both of which are more than half of the total number of counties. Correspondingly, a number of substations and power transmission lines have been built in various places, with a total of 230,000 kilometers of power transmission lines laid.
