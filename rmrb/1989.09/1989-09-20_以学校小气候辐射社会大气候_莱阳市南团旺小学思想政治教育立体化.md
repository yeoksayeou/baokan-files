Laixiang City South Tuanyuan Primary School in Shandong Province focuses on optimizing the educational environments of the school, family, and society, establishing a three-dimensional framework for primary school ideological and political work and moral education. This ensures that students receive good moral education at any time and in any place in their daily lives, thereby promoting social stability and harmonious interpersonal relationships. The school has fostered a culture of respecting teachers and education, and adhering to laws and regulations. These practices have been well-received, and the school has been recognized as a "Shandong Province Advanced Collective for Youth Work" and a "Yantai City Advanced Unit for Teaching and Educating."

Previously, the school relied solely on internal efforts for ideological and moral education, but students were often influenced by negative social trends, resulting in unsatisfactory educational outcomes. To address this, the school implemented three measures:

First, integrating school education with family education. In 1984, the school established a parent school, regularly holding lectures to optimize the family education environment and teaching parents scientific methods for educating their children. This ensured close cooperation between the school and parents. Some parents voluntarily organized "Cultivating Good Children and Civilized Families" competitions, demonstrating through their actions—such as maintaining family harmony, respecting the elderly, avoiding alcoholism and gambling, and maintaining good neighborly relations—that they were influencing their children to develop good habits. This helped counteract the trend of spoiling only children and assisted the school in cultivating children's virtues of loving labor, discipline, unity, simplicity, respecting the elderly, and loving the young. Some parents who were previously disrespectful to the elderly or engaged in alcoholism and gambling changed their ways to educate their children, contributing to the improvement of social customs.

Second, integrating school education with social education. The school established over a dozen educational outreach points and off-campus tutoring stations based on students' residential areas. They invited respected individuals from society to serve as tutors, strengthening the management of students outside of school. This ensured that students' behavior in every corner of society was quickly reported back to the school, truly creating a good moral education environment where students are guided at school, managed at home, and assisted in society. For example, a primary school student took 10 yuan to buy candy at a store, and the cashier immediately detained the student, educating them not to spend money recklessly, and wrote a letter to the school to investigate the source of the money.

Third, integrating school education with student self-management. In addition to strengthening teachers' role modeling, the school established student self-management organizations. The school set up a "Civilized and Polite Supervision Post," with a Young Pioneer leader on duty each day to manage the school's activities. Each class appointed a "Civilized and Polite Observer" to record the class's daily behavior and conduct evaluations. All students took turns managing, serving as both managers and recipients of education, embodying the democratic nature of ideological education. Students received education and improved their abilities through self-management.

South Tuanyuan Primary School divides students' moral education goals into three levels: basic goals, core goals, and long-term goals. The basic goal is to educate students to become independent and creative good students. The core goal is to educate students to become good citizens who benefit the country and the people and uphold morality. The long-term goal is to become outstanding communist warriors. They focus on two aspects to achieve these moral education goals: a long-term plan and a short-term plan. The school formulated the "Seven-Year Moral Education Sequence from Kindergarten to Fifth Grade" as the "long-term plan," proposing different requirements based on the psychological characteristics of different age groups. For example, they require kindergarteners not to hit or scold others, lower-grade students to respect others, middle-grade students to love the collective, and upper-grade students to advocate for democracy and have the country and people in their hearts. The seven-year ideological and political education from kindergarten to primary school graduation is systematically and scientifically arranged, progressing step-by-step, and overcoming the randomness and arbitrariness of ideological education. The "short-term plan" provides specific and detailed requirements for students' behavior. They formulated the "Primary School Daily Behavior Regulations," proposing specific requirements for students' behavior in seven stages: waking up, going to school, attending classes, breaks, physical exercises, extracurricular activities, and after-school study. This ensures that students' words and deeds have guidelines to follow, making moral education systematic, specific, and scientific.

　　以学校小气候辐射社会大气候
    ——莱阳市南团旺小学思想政治教育立体化
　　李志杰
    山东省莱阳市南团旺小学注重优化学校、家庭和社会教育环境，建立起小学思想政治工作和德育教育的立体格局，使学生在现实生活中随时随地接受良好的品德教育，从而促进社会大环境的安定和人际关系的和睦，社会形成尊师重教、遵纪守法的好风气。这些做法受到好评，学校被评为“山东省少儿工作先进集体”和“烟台市教书育人先进单位”。
    过去，该校对学生进行思想品德教育单纯依靠学校，学生受社会不良风气影响，教育效果很不理想。为了改变这种情况，他们采取三条措施：
    一是学校教育同家庭教育相结合。他们于1984年办起家长学校，定期举办优化家庭教育环境讲座，向家长传授科学教育孩子的知识，使学校教育得到家长的密切配合。一些家长自发开展“培养教育好孩子文明家庭赛”，家长以家庭和睦、孝敬老人、不酗酒赌博、和邻居友好相处的实际行动，教育影响孩子，扭转目前独生子女娇生惯养的风气，配合学校培养孩子爱劳动、守纪律、团结友爱、艰苦朴素、尊老爱幼的好品德。一些不孝敬老人、有酗酒、赌博行为的家长为教育孩子，也改掉恶习，促进了社会风气的好转。
    二是学校教育与社会教育相结合。他们按学生居住区建起十多个教育网点和校外辅导站，聘请社会上德高望重的人担任辅导员，加强对学生的校外管理，使学生在社会每个角落的行为都很快反馈回学校，真正为学生创造一个在校有人教、在家有人管、在社会有人帮的良好品德教育环境。如一名小学生拿10元钱到商店买糖吃，售货员马上把学生留下，教育他不要随便花钱，并写信让学校查明钱的来历。
    三是学校教育与学生自我管理相结合。他们除加强教师言传身教外，在学校建立学生自我管理机构，学校设文明礼貌监督哨，每天安排一名少先队干部值日，管理全校学生活动。每班设一名文明礼貌观察员，记录全班一天的情况，向全班讲评。全体学生轮流管理，既是管理者又是受教育者，体现了思想教育的民主性，学生在自我管理中受到教育，提高能力。
    南团旺小学把学生德育目标划成三个层次，即基础目标、基本目标和远大目标。基础目标是教育学生做自立创造的好学生，基本目标是教育学生踏向社会做一个利国利民讲道德的好公民，远大目标是成为优秀的共产主义战士。他们为德育目标的实现抓一长一短两条线。学校制定《幼儿到小学五年级七年德育教育序列》作为“长线”，根据不同年龄心理特点分别提出要求。如对幼儿要求不打人骂人，对低年级要求尊重别人；对中年级要求热爱集体；对高年级要求讲民主，心中有祖国和人民。学生从幼儿到小学毕业的7年思想政治教育有整体、科学的安排，循序渐进，克服思想教育的盲目性、随意性。“短线”则对学生的行为要求具体细致，他们制订《小学生一日行为细则》，对学生一天从起床、上学、上课、课间、课间操、课外活动、晚学后七个阶段的言行，分别提出具体要求，让学生一言一行有所遵循，使学生思想品德教育系列化、具体化、科学化。
