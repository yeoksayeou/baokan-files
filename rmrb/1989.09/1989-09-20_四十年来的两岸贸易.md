Trade between mainland China and Taiwan is an economic exchange between different regions within the same country. Due to well-known reasons, in the nearly thirty years since the founding of New China, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been in a state of sharp political and military confrontation, and all direct exchanges between the people of the two sides have been cut off as a result.

In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed and established the major policy of striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Subsequently, the concept of "one country, two systems" was put forward, becoming the basic policy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government for solving the Taiwan issue. This has brought the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait into a new stage of development.

Since 1979, indirect trade between the two sides has developed rapidly. By the end of 1988, the cumulative indirect trade volume between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait had reached $8.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was exported from the mainland to Taiwan and $6.7 billion was imported from Taiwan. Over the 10 years, the trade volume between the two sides increased by an average of 48.6% per year, with exports from the mainland to Taiwan increasing by an average of 26.9% per year and imports from Taiwan increasing by an average of 68% per year. Last year, the indirect trade volume between the two sides reached a record high of $2.72 billion, an increase of 35.3 times over 1979. Of this, $480 million was exported from the mainland to Taiwan and $2.24 billion was imported from Taiwan, an increase of 38.6 times and 106.8 times over 1979, respectively.

In terms of trade methods, although only indirect trade is currently possible, the specific practices have undergone significant changes over the past 10 years. With the return of more than 400,000 Taiwanese compatriots to the mainland for visits and tourism last year, businesspeople from both sides of the Taiwan Strait have had more opportunities for direct contact. Taiwanese businesspeople can not only participate in the Canton Fair and other mainland export commodity trade fairs but also visit and inspect various parts of the motherland and directly negotiate business with mainland trading companies. However, due to the "three noes" policy of the Taiwan authorities, the two sides still cannot sign contracts directly or settle accounts directly. The transportation of goods also has to be done by ships calling at ports in other countries or regions or by transshipment. In addition, under the principle of "strict import, loose export," the Taiwan authorities still have many restrictions on mainland products entering Taiwan, which greatly hinders the two-way exchange of trade between the two sides.

To protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties involved in indirect trade between the two sides, since last year, relevant civilian organizations on both sides have been in contact in Hong Kong to discuss practical and feasible ways to resolve trade disputes between the two sides and have made some progress.

This year, indirect trade between the two sides continues to develop. In the first half of the year, the trade volume between the two sides through Hong Kong reached $1.75 billion, and it is estimated that the full-year trade volume will exceed $3 billion. After the political turmoil in Beijing, many Taiwanese businesspeople have gradually understood the truth about the Beijing incident and realized that the mainland's open policy and various policies towards Taiwan will not change. Many far-sighted Taiwanese businesspeople have not stopped trading with the mainland for even a day and are also exploring the possibility of further expanding trade exchanges. However, we have also seen that for a period of time, the Taiwan authorities have misjudged the situation and launched another wave of anti-communist sentiment, calling for so-called economic sanctions and "political counterattacks" against the mainland. Such backward and harmful actions will not only cast a shadow over the further development of cross-strait trade but will ultimately backfire.

Over the past 40 years, the development of trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has been a tortuous journey. The facts have proven that developing equal and mutually beneficial trade relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has played a role in complementing each other, benefiting both sides, and promoting common prosperity. We sincerely hope to work together with the enlightened businesspeople of Taiwan to promote the normalization of trade relations between the two sides as soon as possible. With both sides working together, we can revitalize China. A united China will stand tall and prosperous in the world.

　　四十年来的两岸贸易
　　对外经济贸易部对台湾经贸关系司副司长　安民
    中国大陆同台湾地区的贸易，属于国内不同地区之间的经济交流。由于众所周知的原因，在新中国建立以后的近三十年中，海峡两岸处于尖锐的政治和军事对峙状态，两岸人民的一切直接交往也因之隔绝。
    1978年12月中共十一届三中全会，提出并确立了争取和平统一祖国的大政方针。此后，又提出“一个中国、两种制度”的构想，成为中国共产党和中国政府对解决台湾问题的基本方针，使海峡两岸关系进入了一个新的发展时期。
    1979年以来的10年间，两岸间接贸易有了飞速的发展。截至1988年底，海峡两岸间接贸易额累计已经达到82亿美元，其中大陆向台湾出口15亿美元，自台湾进口67亿美元。10年间两岸贸易额平均每年递增48.6％，其中大陆对台出口平均每年递增26.9％，自台湾进口平均每年递增68％。去年，两岸间接贸易额达到创纪录的27.2亿美元，比1979年增长35.3倍，其中大陆对台出口4.8亿美元，自台进口22.4亿美元，分别比1979年增长38.6倍和106.8倍。
    在贸易方式上，虽然目前只能进行间接贸易，但是具体做法10年来也有了较大变化。随着去年40多万台胞回大陆探亲、旅游，海峡两岸的工商人士有了更多直接接触的机会，台湾工商人士不仅可以参加广交会等大陆出口商品交易会，而且可以到祖国各地参观、考察，直接与大陆贸易公司洽谈业务。但是囿于台湾当局的“三不政策”，双方仍不能直接签约、直接结汇。货物的运输也要采取货轮到其它国家或地区港口弯靠或接驳的方式。此外，台湾当局在“进严出宽”的原则下，对大陆产品进入台湾仍有诸多限制，使两岸贸易的双向交流受到很大阻碍。
    为了维护两岸间接贸易各方的合法权益，去年以来，两岸有关民间机构已在香港进行接触，探讨解决双方贸易纠纷的切实可行的办法，并取得了一些进展。
    今年，两岸间接贸易继续发展。上半年两岸经香港转口的贸易额已达17.5亿美元，估计全年转口贸易额将超过30亿元。北京政治风波后，许多台湾工商人士已经逐步了解了北京事件的真相，认识到中国大陆开放政策和各项对台政策不会改变，许多有远见的台湾厂商不仅一天也没有停止同大陆的贸易往来，而且还在探讨进一步扩大贸易往来的可能性。但是我们也看到，一个时期以来，台湾当局错误估计了形势，又一次掀起反共浪潮，叫嚷对大陆进行所谓的经济制裁和“政治反攻”。这种倒行逆施，不仅将给两岸通商的进一步发展投下阴影，而且最终将会搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    40年来，海峡两岸的贸易发展走过了一条曲折的路。事实证明，发展海峡两岸平等互利、互通有无的贸易关系，起到了互补互益、共同繁荣的作用。我们真诚地希望同台湾工商界的有识之士一起共同努力，早日促成两岸贸易关系的正常化。两岸携手，振兴中华。一个统一的中国，将会以更加繁荣富强的面貌，屹立于世界。
