CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin this afternoon warmly received a delegation from the German Democratic Republic, led by Egon Krenz, a member of the Central Political Bureau and Central Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, at Zhongnanhai.

Jiang, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended a warm welcome to Krenz and the delegation members for their visit to China and for participating in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Krenz conveyed the greetings of Honecker, Stoph, and Sindermann, leaders of the German Democratic Republic, to Jiang.

Jiang asked Krenz to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to Honecker and other leaders of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Jiang said, "In 1986, when Comrade Honecker visited China, we met in Shanghai. When I accompanied him to visit a factory, I saw that Comrade Honecker had a deep affection for the workers, which left a deep impression on me. Since then, the relations between our two parties and two countries have developed very well, and we are both very pleased."

He said, "The relations between the two parties and two countries are very good. Not long ago, when China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the party and government of the German Democratic Republic were the first to stand up and clearly support China. 'We are deeply grateful for this.'"

Jiang highly praised the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in building socialism under complex conditions. He expressed that China supports the party and government of the German Democratic Republic in adhering to socialism, safeguarding national sovereignty, and opposing any activities aimed at undermining the socialism of the German Democratic Republic. He sincerely hopes that the German Democratic Republic will achieve greater successes in all aspects under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party. Krenz expressed his thanks for this.

Krenz handed over letters of congratulation from Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Willi Stoph, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Horst Sindermann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, to the Chinese leadership on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Krenz also, on behalf of the party and government of the German Democratic Republic, presented Jiang with a certificate regarding the equipment used for training workers. The German Democratic Republic will provide this set of equipment as a gift to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Jiang expressed his thanks for this.

Those present at the meeting included Wolfgang Rauchfuss, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and other members of the delegation, as well as Zhu Liang, a member of the Central Committee of the CPC and Director of the International Liaison Department.

Wan Li, in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People, met with Egon Krenz, a member of the Central Political Bureau and Central Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic. Wan Li said, "In 1985, Chairman Sindermann of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic visited China, and Vice Chairman Wang Renzhong was also invited to visit the German Democratic Republic. We are very satisfied with the friendly ties established between the National People's Congress of China and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic."

Wan Li told the guests, "When we suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on June 8, clearly supporting our decisive measures and opposing foreign interference in China's internal affairs. We express our thanks for this."
