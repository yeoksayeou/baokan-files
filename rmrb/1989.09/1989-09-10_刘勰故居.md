Liu Xie's former residence is the Dinglin Temple on Fulaishan Mountain.

Fulaishan Mountain is located in Juxian County, Shandong, about nine kilometers west of the city. It is a collective name for the three peaks: Fulaifeng, Yulanfeng, and Zhenglaifeng. Dinglin Temple is nestled among these three peaks, built on the southern slope of Fulaifeng. Upon entering the mountain, one is greeted by a pathway lined with locust and willow trees, and the entire mountain is covered with pines and cypresses. It is like entering a green paradise, with the deep and secluded scenery of the ancient temple.

Dinglin Temple was built during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, over 1,400 years ago. The front courtyard houses the Mahavira Hall, the middle courtyard the Scripture Hall, and the rear courtyard the Hall of Three Teachings. The "Scripture Hall" is named in memory of Liu Xie's work on the scriptures. According to the "Biography of Liu Xie" in the "History of the Liang Dynasty," "The scripture collection of Dinglin Temple was compiled by Liu Xie." At the age of 37, Liu Xie completed China's first literary theory and criticism work, "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons." Shortly after, he was commissioned to write scriptures at the Dinglin Temple in Jiankou. In his later years, he became a monk and returned to his hometown, where he built the temple that is now Dinglin Temple on Fulaishan Mountain. He died unexpectedly. The plaque for the "Scripture Hall" was inscribed by Guo Moruo. The hall has two floors, each with three rooms, simple and elegant, with no decorations. Inside, there are portraits of Liu Xie and various editions of "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," as well as related research works. The courtyard is small, with various trees such as pines, cypresses, paulownias, locusts, and banyans. During the banyan blossom season, the courtyard is filled with a fresh scent. Originally, there was a tomb and a pagoda to the west of the temple, but they were damaged in a major earthquake during the seventh year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. The iron Buddha sank into the underworld, and the "Hanyue Stele" was shattered and left in the wilderness. Today, there are no traces of the stele or the tomb, and the only remaining relic is a stone inscription of Liu Xie's calligraphy, now located on Feilaifeng.

Leaving Dinglin Temple and heading south, crossing the Willow Bridge, passing through the Spring Gorge, and going through the waterfall, one arrives at Feilaifeng. Here, the strange rocks resemble animals, some crouching, some lying down, some running, and some leaping, with a thousand postures and endless charm. Among the strange rocks stands a red pavilion named "Wenxin Pavilion," with six eaves and an elegant structure. It was built to commemorate the 1,460th anniversary of the completion of "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons." Inside the pavilion stands a natural giant stone. On the smooth surface of the stone, three large seal script characters "Xiangshan Shu" are carved, each character about a foot long, with a profound and ancient style. The inscription reads "Hidden Scholar Hui Di," which is Liu Xie's Buddhist name. It is unique and extremely precious. However, the meaning of the three characters is subject to various interpretations. One interpretation is that it summarizes the three major scenic spots of Fulaishan: "Xiang" refers to the iron Buddha in the temple, which has now been destroyed, "Shan" refers to the three peaks of Fulaishan, and "Shu" refers to the ginkgo tree. This tree is in front of the Mahavira Hall, with a height of nearly thirty meters, lush branches and leaves, and a magnificent appearance that blocks out the sky. According to the "Zuozhuan," "In the eleventh year of Duke Xin's reign, in the ninth month on the day of Xinmao, the Duke and the people of Ju made an alliance at Fulaishan," and it is said that the alliance was made under this tree. Experts have determined that the tree is over 3,000 years old, making it the "First Ginkgo Tree in the World." The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has broadcast its image to the world, making it a world-renowned sight. There are many cliff carvings on Fulaishan, all inscribed by famous people of various dynasties. One of them reads, "Ancient trees remain from the Yuan Dynasty, ancient people once spoke of this secluded residence, where are the ancient books and lotus flowers now? They are not as good as several volumes of 'The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons.'" This poem reveals the secret of why this deep mountain temple is famous worldwide.

　　刘勰故居
　　张寒朗
    刘勰故居即浮来山定林寺。
    浮来山在山东莒县，距城西九公里，系鼎足而峙的佛来峰、原来峰和正来峰的统称。定林寺位于三峰环抱，依佛来峰南麓山势构筑。进得山口，槐柳夹道，松柏满山，如入绿色洞天，可谓山深寺古，景色幽邃。
    定林寺始建于南北朝，距今已有一千四百多年。寺前院为大雄宝殿，中院为校经楼，后院为三教堂。“校经楼”则为纪念刘勰校经而命名。《梁书·刘勰传》载：“定林寺经藏，勰所定也”。刘勰三十七岁时写成中国第一部文学理论批评专著《文心雕龙》，不久即奉敕撰经京口定林寺，晚年出家返籍，创建佛寺即今浮来山定林寺，不期而卒。“校经楼”匾额为郭沫若补题，楼二层各三间，古朴典雅，略无装饰，内陈刘勰画像和《文心雕龙》历代版本及其有关研究著作。楼院不大，杂植松柏、桐槐和榕花树，榕花盛时，清香满院。寺西原有墓塔，清康熙七年遭大地震损坏，“铁佛悯莒归地府，彦和碑碎遗荒坟”，今碑坟均无迹可寻，唯一的遗迹是刘勰书法刻石，现存于飞来峰上。
    出定林寺南行，过柳桥，越泉峡，穿飞瀑，便到飞来峰。这里怪石为兽，或蹲、或卧、或奔、或腾，千姿百态，奇趣天成。怪石丛中立一红亭，名“文心亭”，六角飞檐，玲珑有致，系为纪念《文心雕龙》成书一千四百六十周年所建。亭内立一天然巨石，石之平滑处镌刻篆书“象山树”三字，字大盈尺，浑穆苍古，落款为“隐士慧地题”，慧地为刘勰出家的法号。绝无仅有，弥足珍贵。唯三字含义，解说纷纭，其中一解说是概括浮来三大景观：“象”指寺内铁佛，今已毁，“山”指浮来三峰，“树”指银杏树。此树在大雄宝殿前，树高近三十米，枝繁叶茂，遮天蔽日，状极雄伟。《左传》载：“隐公十一年九月辛卯，公及莒人盟于浮来”，传即盟于此树之下，经专家鉴定，树龄在三千年以上，定为“天下银杏第一树”，联合国教科文组织曾向全世界播放过它的身影，成为世界珍观。浮来山摩崖刻石颇多，均系历代名人题咏，其中一首“古木扶苏元代余，古人曾说此幽居，贝叶莲花今何在？不抵雕龙数卷书。”道出这座深山古寺名扬天下的奥秘。
