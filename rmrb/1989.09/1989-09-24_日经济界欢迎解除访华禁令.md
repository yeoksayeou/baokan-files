Japanese economic circles have welcomed the lifting of the restriction on visiting Beijing, which the Japanese government announced yesterday would be effective starting September 25.

According to reports in today's newspapers, the Japanese government's decision to lift the advisory for Japanese citizens to self-restrict visits to Beijing has been met with widespread approval in the economic sector.

The *Yomiuri Shimbun* today quoted trade industry sources as saying that now that Sino-Japanese exchanges have resumed, trade relations will return to the level before the Tiananmen incident. The report said that some economic leaders will soon visit China. The vice-chairman of Keidanren, Kawai Ryoi, and the president of Kyokuto Kogyo, Haruna Kazutake, among other economic and trade leaders, will visit Beijing before the end of the month to participate in a symposium marking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation.

Some newspapers reported that large companies and industrial sectors are also very concerned about the resumption of official loans, believing that once official loans are restored, private financial institutions will follow suit, and long-term, large-scale cooperation projects such as joint ventures and technology transfers can be pursued.

    日经济界欢迎解除访华禁令
    新华社东京9月23日电　据此间报纸今天报道，日本政府昨天宣布自9月25日起解除要求日本人对访问北京要自我限制的劝告后，经济界对此普遍表示欢迎。
    《读卖新闻》今天援引贸易界人士的话说，现在日中交流已没有障碍，贸易关系将恢复到天安门事件前的水平。报道说，一些经济界领导人将陆续访华。经团联副会长河合良一和九红公司董事长春名和雄等经济贸易界领导人将于月底前往北京，参加中国国际信托投资公司成立10周年讨论会。
    一些报纸说，一些大公司和产业界还十分关心恢复官方贷款，认为官方贷款一恢复，民间金融机构就会发动起来，就可以致力于合资企业和技术转让等长期大型合作项目。
