The "Famous Enterprises of Tianjin" series was launched in Beijing yesterday. Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, wrote an article titled "Tianjin Enterprises on the March" for the series, emphasizing the need to fully play the role of workers as masters.

The "Famous Enterprises of Tianjin" series, published by the PLA Press, includes 480 enterprises, totaling over 1.6 million words, along with a large amount of data. It reflects the significant achievements and experiences of Tianjin in the reform and opening-up, showcasing the charm of Tianjin enterprises.

In his article, Li Ruihuan pointed out that fully playing the role of workers as masters is our inherent political advantage. Through in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, through practical steps of democratic construction such as the workers' congress system, we should enhance workers' sense of being masters. At the same time, leaders at all levels of enterprises should firmly establish the belief in relying on the masses, learn the working methods of the mass line, and truly put the people in their hearts, think of the people in their work, and do everything for the people and rely on the people.

Rei Jiequn, Zhang Youyu, and Tianjin municipal party and government leaders attended the launch ceremony yesterday.
