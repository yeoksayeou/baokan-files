Military dance is a member of the military arts family and an important part of Chinese dance art since the founding of New China. It was born in the smoke and fire of the war years, rooted in the fertile soil of national culture, and is deeply imbued with the rich heritage of national culture. Since the founding of the nation, it has produced many masterpieces with far-reaching influence, standing out uniquely on the Chinese dance stage.

Today, as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and hold the entire military arts performance, more than sixty dance and ballet works have emerged. Among these numerous works, military-themed dances occupy a very prominent position. They praise the military's might and spirit and the surging waves in the soldiers' hearts from different angles, different perspectives, and different historical layers, thus converging into a powerful main melody of military life. Some works are filled with deep affection for the Party and the motherland (such as "The Flag of the Republic," "Pillar"); some sketch the soldiers' sense of mission and duty and their deep affection for the Chinese land (such as "The Glory of the Battle Flag"); some ripple with white waves, reflecting the soldiers' pure hearts (such as "The Motherland in the Sailors' Hearts"); some ride the winds of the times, soaring in the vast sky (such as "The Heroic Wind in the Sky"); some pour their hot blood onto the sacred land flying the five-star red flag (such as "Blood Variations," "Guardians of the Republic"); and the large-scale dance "Wind from Taihang" uses "Mountain Monument," "Mountain Milk," "Mountain Sacrifice," "Mountain Endurance," and "Mountain Gate" to create the towering Taihang Mountains that have nurtured, strengthened, and shaped us—calling on history to urge us to carry on and open up new paths. At the same time, dance choreographers have extended their creative reach to society and the vast realm of national culture, incorporating various themes and styles from ancient times, reality, and folk culture, forming a landscape of overlapping peaks and colorful hues that complement military dances.

The ballet "Meteor in the West" by the Battle Song and Dance Troupe that I have seen is a very serious work with a high cultural character and tragic elements. It depicts female soldiers of the Red Army's Western Route Army who, after being defeated in the Hexi Corridor, were subjected to various humiliations by the enemy and then rejected by representatives of the "leftist" line when they requested to return to the unit, forcing them to wander among the people; during the Cultural Revolution, the "Red Guards" took them to the "revolutionary" trial stage for brutal beatings; it was not until the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee that the truth was revealed, and they washed away the dirt on their bodies. The work has clearly broken away from the general descriptions of war in previous ballets and the single-layered praise of heroic figures who fight to the death and never surrender. The author's pen delves into the depth of the characters' psychology, not only portraying their visible hardships but also revealing the complex psychological journey of loyalty and humiliation, firm belief and loss of trust. This complex psychological journey not only makes this ordinary female soldier radiate a tragic beauty but also, through her, leaves a broader and deeper field for people to think about.

As for ethnic and folk dances, they seem to only showcase local customs and are lively and joyful dance forms. In fact, this type of dance also needs to improve its cultural character. The "Brave Bull and Mountain Child" by the Frontline Song and Dance Troupe has a breakthrough in character and realm. This is a theme from ancient times, characterized by an attempt to reveal the relationship between humans and nature through dance materials from ethnic and folk sources and dance vocabulary refined from life, through exaggeration and distortion without losing authenticity. The author is not satisfied with superficial excitement but seeks internal richness; does not pursue external strength and jumping around but seeks the accuracy of dance imagery; does not pursue superficial splendor but seeks primitive beauty, rustic beauty, and a style of inner strength and outer gentleness. Compared to this, the beauty can give people a greater impact and stronger appeal. Of course, the authors of "The Call of the Wild," "Sun, Fire, and Man," and "Fighting to the East" also have similar pursuits, but the results are not the same.

Whether a dance can achieve a certain cultural character, excavate the content and depth of the work, involves the issue of material selection, structure, and whether the dance language has the texture to shape the dance image, etc. It is a comprehensive and comprehensive examination and test of the dancers' ideological quality, cultural quality, dance concepts, artistic tastes, wisdom, and courage, whether they enthusiastically embrace life or adopt an indifferent attitude towards life. For example, we have seen many works with large frameworks but empty content, high ideas but small realities, familiar structural methods, and similar dance languages. Those that rely on atmosphere, techniques, and other non-artistic means to explain are obviously the result of a lack of life, thin emotions, and poor wisdom, and are forcibly squeezed out, naturally lacking a high cultural character. This phenomenon is more prominent in military-themed works, so in recent years, no masterpieces comparable to "Goodbye, Mother" and "Men and Women Treading on Gunpowder" have been found, which is indeed a pity.

　　高扬舞蹈艺术的文化品格
　　赵国政
    部队舞蹈是部队艺术家族中的一个成员，也是新中国舞蹈艺术的重要组成部分。它诞生于炮火硝烟的战争年代，植根于民族文化的沃土之中，饱含着民族文化的深厚底蕴。建国以来佳作迭出，影响深远，在中国舞坛上具有一花独秀之美。
    今天，当庆祝建国四十周年而举办全军文艺调演的时候，又涌现出六十多部舞蹈、舞剧作品。在众多的作品中，军事题材舞蹈占据着十分醒目的位置。它们从不同角度、不同投向、不同的历史横断层，赞美着军人的军威军魂和滚动在军人心灵河床上的热浪狂涛，从而汇聚成一股强劲的军营生活的舞蹈主旋。有的作品饱含着对党、对祖国深情的爱（如《共和国旗帜》、《柱石》）；有的从总体上勾画出军人的使命感和义务感与神州大地魂牵神系的缕缕情思（如《战旗的风采》）；有的泛动着洁白的浪花，将士兵的心灵映衬得纯洁如洗
  （如《祖国在水兵心中》）；有的驾驶着时代的风雷，在万里长空翱翔（如《长空雄风》）；有的将一腔热血奉洒在飘扬着五星红旗的神圣土地（如
  《血的变奏》、《共和国卫士》）；而大型歌舞《风从太行来》，则通过“山碑”、“山乳”、“山祭”、“山韧”、“山门”五个块垒，叠化出生我、养我、壮我、塑我的巍巍太行——让历史向今人发出继往开来的呼喊……与此同时，舞蹈编导也把创作触角伸向社会，伸向民族文化的广阔领域，集古代、现实、民族民间等各种题材、体裁，形成群峦叠翠、如霓似彩的与军事舞蹈相映生辉的景观。
    我所看到的战斗歌舞团的舞剧《西天的流星》是一部极为严肃、富有较高文化品格的悲剧性作品。描写的是战败于河西走廊的红军西路军女战士，受到敌人百般凌辱之后，又遭到“左”的路线代表人物拒绝她要求归队的请求，因而不得不流落民间；“文革”中“红卫兵”又将其押上“革命”的审判台进行残酷的殴斗；直到党的十一届三中全会后才真相大白，洗去身上的尘垢……作品明显摆脱了以往舞剧对战争的一般描写，也摆脱了以往那种对于英雄人物死打硬拚、宁死不屈的单层面的颂扬。作者的笔触意在向人物的心理深度掘进，不仅写了她看得见的坎坷命运，更揭示出她忠贞与委曲、坚定信仰与失去信任两相交织的、复杂的心理历程。这种复杂的心理历程不仅使这位普通的女战士身上放射出悲壮的美，也透过她留下了可资人们进入更为宽阔、更具深度的思考。
    以民族、民间舞来说，它给人们的印象好像只能展现风土人情，是欢欢喜喜、热热闹闹似的舞蹈形式，实际上，这类舞蹈也需要文化品格的提高。前线歌舞团的《悍牛与山童》就有一种品格和境界的开拓。这是远古时代题材，其特点是力图通过来自民族、民间的舞蹈素材以及从生活中提炼出来的舞蹈语汇，经过不失其真的夸张与变形，揭示出人与自然的关系中人的生命情调和生命力量。作者不满足表面的轰轰烈烈，而追求内在的充实；不求外在的如何刚武而大蹦大跳，而求舞蹈形象雕琢的准确；不图层表的华丽，而追求原始的美、朴拙的美和内刚外柔的风格。比较起来，这种美能给人以更大的冲击和更强的感召力。当然，《山野的呼唤》、《太阳·火和人》、《闯关东》的作者，也有着类似的追求倾向，只是成果不尽一致。
    一个舞蹈能否达到一定的文化品格，开掘出作品的涵量和深度，有取材问题，有结构问题，有舞蹈语言是否具备足以塑造舞蹈形象的质感问题等等。它是对舞蹈家们的思想素质、文化素质、舞蹈观念、艺术趣味、才思和勇气，是热烈地拥抱生活还是对生活采取漠然的态度……全面地、综合地审检和考验。譬如我们所看到的为数不少的作品，框架大而内容虚，设想高而实境小，结构方法似曾相识，舞蹈语言彼此类同。那些靠造气氛，靠技巧搪塞，靠其它非艺术手段进行解释，显然是在生活匮乏、情感稀薄、才思欠佳的状况下，强压硬挤出来的结果，自然不具较高的文化品格。这种现象在军事题材作品中比较突出，故而近几年来还未发现能与《再见吧，妈妈》、《踏着硝烟的男儿女儿》相媲美的力作，这不能不是一种遗憾。
