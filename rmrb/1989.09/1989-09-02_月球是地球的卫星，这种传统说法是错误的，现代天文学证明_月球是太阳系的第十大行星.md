The traditional view is that "the Moon orbits the Earth and is Earth's satellite." However, modern astronomy has proven that the Moon is Earth's companion star and the tenth largest planet in the solar system.

In traditional understanding, "the Moon orbits the Earth and is Earth's satellite." But modern astronomy has proven that the Moon is Earth's companion star, the tenth largest planet in the solar system.

The renowned American geophysicist Arthur B. C. Beese once stated in his book "The Earth": "Modern theories of the formation of the solar system confirm that the Moon is a legitimate planet. In reality, the Earth and the Moon have a binary star system relationship, and it is not a parent-child relationship where the Moon is subordinate to the Earth." There is evidence to support this:

First, in terms of formation age, the Moon is slightly older than the Earth. The oldest rocks on the Moon's surface formed 4.6 billion years ago, while the earliest rocks found on Earth are only 3.9 billion years old.

Second, the diameter and mass ratio of the Earth and the Moon are quite similar. The Moon's diameter is over 3,470 kilometers, which is more than a quarter of Earth's diameter of 12,742 kilometers. There is no other satellite in the solar system with such a large proportion relative to its planet. In terms of mass, the Moon's mass is one-eightieth of the Earth's, and there is no other example of this in the solar system.

Third, it does not conform to the characteristics of "terrestrial planets." The major planets in the solar system are divided into two categories: "terrestrial planets" and "Jovian planets." "Terrestrial planets" include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. One of their characteristics is that they have few satellites. This characteristic is purely in reference to Earth, because apart from Earth having a "satellite" the Moon, the other terrestrial planets strictly speaking do not have satellites.

Fourth, the Moon does not orbit the Earth but rather orbits with the Earth. In the solar system, the orbits of other planets are linear. Only the Earth's orbit is wavy (as shown in the diagram). Astronomers have discovered that the reason for this phenomenon is the Moon's influence. As the Moon's companion star, both orbit the Sun along a common orbit—the Earth-Moon orbit. The Earth-Moon orbit is the center of mass for both, with the center closer to the Earth due to its greater mass, and farther from the Moon due to its smaller mass.

Apart from the Sun, the Moon is the celestial body that has the greatest influence on Earth. Therefore, restoring the Moon's true identity as a planet has significant implications for humanity.

    月球是地球的卫星，这种传统说法是错误的，现代天文学证明
    月球是太阳系的第十大行星
    在人们的传统认识中，“月球围绕地球旋转，是地球的卫星”。但现代天文学证明月球是地球的伴星，是太阳系的第十大行星。
    美国著名地球物理学家阿瑟·拜塞尔在《地球》一书中就曾说过：近代太阳系形成的学说确认月球是个正统的行星。实际上地球和月球是一个双星系统的关系，而绝不是月球从属于地球的母子关系。有如下证据：
    第一，在形成年代上，月球略早于地球。月球表面最古老的岩石形成于四十六亿年前，而地球上发现最早的岩石形成时间不过三十九亿年。
    第二，地球月球的直径和质量比相差不多。月球的直径是三千四百七十多公里，超过地球的直径一点二七万公里的四分之一，这样大比例的卫星在太阳系中没有第二个。从质量上看，月球的质量是地球的八十一分之一，这在太阳系中也没有第二例。
    第三，不合乎“类地行星”的规律特点。太阳系的大行星共分两大类：即“类地行星”和“类木行星”。“类地行星”包括水星、金星、地球和火星。其特点之一是卫星较少。而这一特点纯粹是针对地球而言的，因为除地球有一个“卫星”月亮外，其他类地行星严格地说都没有卫星。
    第四，月球并没有绕着地球旋转，而是伴着地球对转。在太阳系中，其它行星的公转轨道都是直线状的图形。唯有地球的公转轨道呈波浪形（如图）。天文学家们研究发现，出现这种怪事的原因正是月球的作用。月球做为地球的伴星，两者在太阳引力作用下，沿着共同的轨道——地月轨道围绕着太阳运转，地月轨道是两者的质量中心，地球质量大，所以这个中心离地球近；月亮质量小，这个中心就离月亮远。
    除太阳外，月球是对地球影响最大的星球，因而，恢复月球行星的本来面目，对人类有相当大的意义。
