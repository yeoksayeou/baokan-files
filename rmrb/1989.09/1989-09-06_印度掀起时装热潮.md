In the 1980s, India began to experience a fashion boom. In the capital New Delhi and other major cities, it is common to see young people dressed in the latest fashions. New clothing stores and fashion designers are popping up everywhere, signaling the rise of a new fashion industry.

The most representative of India's fashion trend is the fashion street in Mumbai and the adjacent high-end suit shop. The fashion street is lined with shops, each offering unique styles and a variety of fabrics. There are affordable and trendy cotton garments, as well as high-quality, luxurious formal wear. Each shop has its own distinctive offerings. The suit shop sells high-end complete outfits, including silk garments, pleated and tie-dyed cotton fabrics, sheer chiffon saris, and gold-threaded wedding saris. A silk sari here can cost as much as 18,000 rupees, a price that makes customers gasp.

Young fashion designers who have studied abroad are innovating and showcasing their talents. They absorb foreign cultures while drawing on traditional strengths, deliberately innovating to create modern fashion. The new styles of shawl-kameez (a combination of a fitted top and loose pants) no longer use scarves, and the pants are often replaced with pleated skirts.

Retro fashion is also a new trend in Indian fashion design. Designers are researching and developing some old styles. The traditional cotton shimmering blouses from Rajasthan, recreated using ancient handlooms, sell for 1,000 rupees in Mumbai and New Delhi. Despite the high price, the classic and elegant designs align with the current global fashion trend of retro styles, making them popular with both domestic and international customers.

The main reason for the rise of the fashion trend in India is the country's relatively rapid economic development in recent years. With increasing wealth, people are seeking fashion and paying more attention to their appearance. Additionally, Indians have more opportunities to travel abroad, exposing them to foreign cultures and fashionable clothing styles.

In recent years, the Indian government has taken measures to encourage the fashion industry, particularly the export of clothing. Clothing exports have become an important source of foreign exchange for India. In the 1986-1987 fiscal year, clothing exports exceeded $1.1 billion. In the first 11 months of the 1987-1988 fiscal year, India's clothing exports reached $1.3 billion, nearly half of which came from fashion exports. The government has listed the clothing industry as a key sector for economic development, providing an 8% subsidy for export companies and issuing special permits for the import of machinery and raw materials. Additionally, fashion schools have been established to train designers, and a national fashion research institute has been set up in the capital, New Delhi. It is expected that in the near future, Indian fashion will take the world stage and showcase its unique style.

    印度掀起时装热潮
    张旭平
    进入80年代，印度开始掀起一股时装热潮。在首都新德里及一些大城市的街上，随时可以看到穿着时髦的青年。新的时装用品商店和时装设计师到处涌现。一个崭新的时装业正在兴起。
    最能代表印度时装热的要数孟买的时装街和与之毗邻的孟买最高级的套服时装店。时装街上，店铺鳞次栉比。服装款式新颖独特，面料种类繁多，有价廉、时髦的普通棉布服，也有做工精良、面料华贵的礼服，家家商店各有千秋。套服时装店销售的则是高级的全套服装，包括锦缎服装、绉折扎染棉织服装、透明薄绢莎丽和带金线的婚礼莎丽。一条丝绸莎丽在这里售价高达18000卢比，昂贵的价格令顾客咋舌。
    在国外学习过的年青服装设计师们标新立异，大展其才。他们在接受外来文化的同时，集传统所长，刻意创新，设计出有现代意识的时装。他们设计的新款式的沙瓦尔卡米兹（一种紧身上衣与宽松长裤结合的套装）已不再用披巾，裤子也往往改成打褶的裙子。
    复古也是印度时装设计的一种新潮流。设计师们对一些古老的款式加以研究开发。他们用古朴的手工织机复制的拉贾斯坦邦传统的棉质闪光女式衬衫，在孟买和新德里售价达1000卢比。尽管价格昂贵，但款式、图案古朴典雅，顺应了当今世界时装样式的复古潮流，因而颇受海内外顾客青睐。
    时装热潮在印度兴起的主要原因，是近年来印度经济发展较快。人们囊中渐丰，温饱之余也要追求时尚，注重衣着打扮。此外，印度人外出旅游的机会也日益增多，人们不仅领略了异国风情，也看到了其他国家流行的时装样式。
    近年来，印度政府对时装业，特别是服装的出口采取了一些鼓励措施。服装出口已成为印度外汇收入的重要来源，1986—1987财政年度，服装出口额超过11亿美元。1987—1988年度头11个月印度的服装出口额则为13亿美元，其中几乎一半是出口时装所得。政府已把服装工业部门列为经济“猛进”部门，为出口厂家提供8％的补助，向它们发放进口机器和原料特别许可证。同时还设立时装学校，培养设计人才，在首都新德里成立了一所全国性的时装研究所。人们预期，在不久的将来，印度时装一定会登上世界舞台，一展风采。
