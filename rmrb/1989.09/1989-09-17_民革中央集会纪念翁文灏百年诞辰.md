People's Daily, Beijing, September 15th - Reporter Mao Lei reports: The China Revolutionary Committee Central Committee held a symposium in Beijing today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of the renowned patriot and outstanding geologist of the older generation, Mr. Weng Wenhao.

Weng Wenhao is one of the founders of geology in China. In his early years, he established China's first geological research institute, making significant contributions to geological research, resource development, and economic construction. He served as the Minister of Economic Affairs and Premier of the Executive Yuan in the Kuomintang government. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, as a high-ranking Kuomintang official returning from overseas to the embrace of the motherland, he was welcomed by the people's government. Chairman Mao Zedong referred to him as a "Kuomintang military and political figure with patriotism."

In his later years, Mr. Weng Wenhao served as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a standing committee member of the China Revolutionary Committee Central Committee.

At today's symposium, Chairman of the China Revolutionary Committee Central Committee, Zhu Xuefan, said that in January 1971, shortly before Mr. Weng passed away in Beijing, he once again recounted the twists and turns of his life, deeply feeling that "only socialism can save China," and yearned for the early end of the separation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, hoping to achieve the great unity and reunification of the Chinese nation.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Honorary Chairman of the China Revolutionary Committee Central Committee, Qu Wu, presided over the meeting.

　　民革中央集会纪念翁文灏百年诞辰
    本报北京9月15日讯　记者毛磊报道：民革中央今天在京举行座谈会，纪念知名爱国人士、老一辈杰出的地质学家翁文灏先生诞辰100周年。
    翁文灏是我国地质学的奠基人之一，早年曾创办中国第一家地质研究所，为地质科学研究、资源开发和经济建设作出了显著成绩。他先后担任过国民党政府经济部长、行政院长等职。新中国成立后，他作为一个从海外回到祖国怀抱的国民党高级人士，受到人民政府的欢迎。毛泽东主席称他是“有爱国心的国民党军政人员”。
    翁文灏先生晚年担任过全国政协委员、民革中央常务委员。
    民革中央主席朱学范在今天的座谈会上说，1971年1月，翁先生在北京病逝前夕，再一次追述自己一生所走过的曲折历程，深切体会到“只有社会主义才能救中国”，渴望早日结束海峡两岸的分离局面，实现中华民族的大团结、大统一。
    全国政协副主席、民革中央名誉主席屈武主持了会议。
