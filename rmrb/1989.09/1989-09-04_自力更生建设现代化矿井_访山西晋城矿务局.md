4 years ago, the Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province was at the bottom of the list in the evaluation of modern mines, and now it has become one of the top modern mines in the country. What did they rely on? They relied on the spirit of self-reliance and the pride of the working class.

Currently, our country's economic construction faces many difficulties, which affect the development of enterprises. How do we face these difficulties, overcome them, and conquer them? The experience of the Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province is worth learning from. In the face of difficulties, we need to have a spirit, start from reality, not be content with being backward, strive to be strong, be self-reliant, and work hard, and we will be able to find a path with Chinese characteristics.

4 years ago, the Jincheng Mining Bureau was not on the list in the evaluation of modern mines.

4 years later, the Jincheng Mining Bureau made rapid progress, and its various indicators were leading the nation. The red list was prominently displayed, and its name was known far and wide.

    - Production: From 5 million tons to 10 million tons, doubling.
    - Efficiency: Each worker produced 4.2 tons, the highest in the nation, 3.5 times the national average for coal mines.
    - Taxes and profits: Contributed over 65 million yuan annually, one of the top 250 enterprises in the nation.
    - Fatality rate per 100 million tons: 0.22 people, reaching the international safety production level.
    - Mechanization level: 100%, 6 mechanized mining teams produced over 100 million tons annually, setting a world-class standard.

What an inspiring achievement! No wonder at this year's celebration, Yu Hong'en, the manager of the China Coal Industry Administration, tightly held the hand of Jia Zhongxiu, the director of the Jincheng Mining Bureau, and said: You have opened up a new path for China's coal industry, worthy of congratulations, and worthy of learning by coal mines across the country.

    Tightening belts and raising funds

The Jincheng Mining Bureau is located in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province. It was originally a small, unknown mine with a designed annual capacity of 3.5 million tons, over 20,000 workers, outdated equipment, and backward technology.

The newly appointed director, Jia Zhongxiu, conducted a thorough investigation and research and concluded that to fundamentally change the appearance of the mining bureau, it must take the path of mechanization.

Mechanization was the long-cherished wish of the 10,000 workers of the Jincheng Mining Bureau. As early as the 1970s, they saw the nearby Lu'an Mining Bureau using mechanized coal mining, replacing heavy manual labor, increasing production, improving efficiency, and reducing the fatality rate. Each year, they took a new step forward, which was so enviable and yearned for.

However, to achieve mechanization, the key was money. A set of mechanized mining equipment cost over 20 million yuan. In the past few years, the state, to encourage coal mines to use mechanization, provided a batch of mechanized mining equipment to enterprises free of charge. Now, with the implementation of the contract responsibility system, the state's financial resources are limited, and enterprises need to raise funds on their own.

Jia Zhongxiu did the math. The entire mine needed to mechanize, which would cost over 70 million yuan. For a small mine, this was a considerable sum. He laid out the situation to the workers and said: We have two choices: One is to be content with being backward and stay with shoveling coal with large iron shovels; the other is to tighten our belts, raise funds on our own, and go for mechanization.

The Jincheng miners, with their spirit of hard work and perseverance, chose the latter path. They tightened their belts, streamlined the organization, cut down unnecessary non-production construction projects, and used the money where it was needed.

The workers' club, which had been due for renovation for a long time, was not renovated. Watching movies, workers carried stools to the open air, and if it rained, they watched under umbrellas.

The workers' dormitories were very crowded, and some workers still lived in cave dwellings on the Loess Plateau. For the sake of a better tomorrow, they did not build new houses for the time being.

The guesthouse was dilapidated, patched up, and used temporarily.

Administrative expenses and travel expenses were strictly controlled, and every penny was used sparingly.

In the mine, every piece of iron wire, every sleeper, every screw... was picked up.

They saved bit by bit, raising over 50 million yuan, but they were still short of over 10 million yuan. They applied for a loan from the bank.

    Studying hard and becoming self-taught experts

Mechanization requires skilled workers. Most of the miners in the Jincheng Mining Bureau came from rural areas. They were hardworking and honest, but their educational level was low. Mastering advanced modern technology was challenging. However, difficulties could not deter the determined miners. Chen Zaihong, the team leader of the Second Coal Mining Team, came from the Loess Plateau. He was tall and outgoing, and when he worked in the mine, he dug coal like a dragon. His team won high production awards every year and was a model team in the province. However, after mechanization, this dragon was once trapped in the net of modernization. However, the net could not trap the dragon. He studied hard, sought advice humbly, and now he has become an outstanding member of the coal mining team again. His team won high production awards every year and became a model team in the mine.

Deputy Chief Engineer Qian Jia, originally from Shanghai, graduated from Hefei University of Technology in the 1950s and came to the Jincheng Coal Mine, where he dealt with manual coal mining every day. Now, over 30 years have passed, and he thought he would never deal with mechanized mining equipment again. Who would have thought that in his prime, fate placed a thick stack of English materials on mechanized mining equipment in front of him.

After countless days and nights, this engineer in his 50s finally wrote a new chapter for the Jincheng Mining Bureau, translating over 500,000 words of English materials.

During those days of mechanization, to advance towards science, how many miners stayed up all night, and how many engineering and technical personnel worked tirelessly...

To enable miners to improve their culture and master technology as soon as possible, the mining bureau sent a large number of people to learn from coal mines in other places and held various types of training classes in their own mining area. In the past two years, the bureau has held 520 training classes for main technical workers, team leaders, and group leaders, training over 20,000 workers. They also sent over 500 workers to various colleges and universities for further study and advanced training.

In saving administrative expenses, they did not spend a penny recklessly, but in cultivating talents, as long as it was appropriate, they spent the money. Every year, they spent over 1 million yuan on self-funded education.

As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." Now, a batch of cultured and skilled miners are growing up. In 1988, compared to 1984, the number of cadres and workers with college education or above increased by 837, and those with junior college education or above increased by over 900, becoming the technical backbone of the mine.

The Jincheng Mining Bureau relied on the spirit of "self-reliance, self-funded talent cultivation, and self-taught expertise" to go from being unlisted to having a clear path, step by step, transforming a backward mining bureau into a first-class modern mine in the country. High efficiency brought about changes in the mining area. Now, the mining area has built a row of new workshops and new workers' dormitories. Although the workers are busy, their hearts are filled with joy.

    自力更生建设现代化矿井
    ——访山西晋城矿务局
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    编者按　4年时间，山西晋城矿务局摘掉了后进的帽子，成为全国第一流的现代化矿井。他们靠什么？靠的是自力更生精神，靠的是工人阶级的志气。
    目前，我们国家的经济建设面临着许多困难，影响到企业的发展。如何迎着困难上，去克服它，战胜它？山西晋城矿务局的经验值得借鉴。在困难面前，就是要有一种精神，从实际出发，不甘落后，奋发图强，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，就会走出一条富有中国特色的路来。
    4年前，山西晋城矿务局在现代化矿井评比中，榜上无名，名落孙山。
    4年后，晋城矿务局急起直追，各项指标在全国遥遥领先，红榜高挂，名扬四海。
    ——产量：由500万吨，跃为1000万吨，翻了一番。
    ——效率：每工达到4.2吨，居全国同行业之首，是全国煤矿平均水平的3.5倍。
    ——利税：一年上交6500多万元，为全国250家最佳企业之一。
    ——百万吨死亡率：0.22人，达到国际安全生产水平。
    ——机械化程度：100％，6个综采队年产超百万吨，创世界先进水平。
    多么鼓舞人心的成就，难怪在今年的庆功会上，中国统配煤炭总公司经理于洪恩紧握着矿务局局长贾仲秀的手说：你们为我国煤炭工作走出了一条新路，值得祝贺，值得各地煤矿学习。
      勒紧裤带　自筹资金
    晋城矿务局位于山西太行山内，原是一个名不见经传的小矿，年设计能力350万吨，职工2万多人，设备陈旧，技术落后。
    新上任的贾仲秀局长，经过一番调查研究后认为，要彻底改变矿务局的面貌，必须走机械化的道路。
    机械化，这是晋城矿务局万名职工多年来梦寐以求的愿望。早在70年代，他们看见邻近的潞安矿务局采用机械化采煤，代替了笨重的体力劳动，产量上去了，效率提高了，死亡率下降了……一年上了一个新台阶，多么令人羡慕，多么令人向往。
    然而，要实现机械化，关键是要钱，一台综采设备两千多万元。前些年，国家为了鼓励煤矿采用机械化，无偿地给企业一批综采设备，而今，实行了承包，国家财力有限，需要企业自筹资金。
    贾仲秀算了一笔帐，整个矿井要上机械化，一共要7000多万元。这对一个小矿来说，是一个相当大的数字，他把这个底交给了群众，他说：摆在我们面前的只有两条路：一条是甘居落后，停留在用大铁锹攉煤上；另一条是勒紧裤带，自筹资金，搞机械化。
    具有艰苦奋斗精神的晋城矿工选择了后一条路。他们紧缩开支，精简机构，砍掉不必要的非生产建设项目……把钱用在刀刃上。
    早就该翻修的工人俱乐部，不翻修了，看电影，工人搬着板凳在露天底下看，下雨了，撑着伞瞧……
    职工宿舍十分拥挤，有些工人还住在黄土高原的窑洞内，为了明天的美好生活，暂时不盖新房。
    招待所破破烂烂，修修补补，先凑合着用。
    行政费用、差旅费，更是严格把关，一分钱掰成两半用。
    井下，一根铁丝，一根枕木，一个螺丝……都要拾起来。……
    他们就是这样一点一滴节约，筹措出5000多万元资金，但，还差1000多万元，他们向银行申请贷款。
        勤学苦练　自学成才
    搞机械化，需要有技术矿工。晋城矿务局大部分矿工来自农村。他们勤劳、朴实，但文化水平不高。掌握现代化的先进技术有一定困难。但，困难压不倒有志气的矿工。采煤二队队长陈再红，来自黄土高原，身体魁梧，性格豪放，下井挖起煤来，像一条蛟龙。他领导的采煤队，年年夺高产，是省里的先进集体。可是，实现机械化后，这条蛟龙，曾一度被困在现代化的罗网中。然而，罗网困不住蛟龙。他勤学苦练，虚心求教，现在，他又成为采煤队的佼佼者了。他所领导的采煤队，年年夺高产，成为矿上的标兵。
    副总工程师钱嘉，原是上海人，50年代，毕业于合肥工业大学，来到晋城煤矿，整天和手工采煤打交道。如今，30多年过去了，他原以为今生今世再也不会搞什么综采设备了；谁料到在他知天命之年，时运却把两米厚的综采设备英文资料摆在他面前。
    经历了多少个日日夜夜，这位50多岁的老工程师，终于为晋城矿务局谱写了新篇章，50多万字的英文资料全部翻译出来了。
    在那些实现机械化日子里，为了向科学进军，多少矿工熬过不眠之夜，多少工程技术人员费尽了心血……
    为了使矿工能够早日提高文化，掌握技术，矿务局派出大批人员到各地煤矿学习，在自己的矿区内举办了各种类型的培训班。这两年，全局共举办主要技术工种工人、队长、班组长培训班520期，共培训职工2万多人次，还送出500多名职工到各类大、中专院校进修和深造。
    在节约行政费用上，他们舍不得乱花一分钱，可是，在培养人才上，只要花得得当，该花的就得花，每年，自费办教育，投资100多万元。
    种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。现在，一批批有文化、有技术的矿工正在成长起来。1988年与1984年相比，大专以上文化程度的干部职工增加837人，中专以上文化程度增加900多人，成了这个矿的技术骨干。
    晋城矿务局就是凭这种“自力更生，自费成才，自学成才”的精神，榜上无名，脚下有路，一步一个脚印，把一个后进的矿务局改变成为全国第一流的现代化矿井。高效益带来了矿区面貌的变化。如今，矿区内建起了一排排崭新的厂房，新建了一座座职工宿舍。尽管职工们劳动紧张，但他们心里充满着欢笑。
