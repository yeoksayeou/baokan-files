In the rugged mountains of western Hubei, not far from the Song Dynasty's Wuyuan Pass, where Ke Juquan promoted agriculture, lies a village shrouded in clouds and mist year-round, rich in legend—the village of Baiyanzi in Mabantang Township, Badong County.

This is a village where Tujia and Han people live together, with Tujia people making up 76% of the population. For many years, this place has been desolate and impoverished, a "three-rely" village that everyone finds depressing.

Yet, in just a few years, a miracle occurred. By 1988, the per capita grain production had risen from 276 jin in 1980 to 1119 jin, and per capita income had increased from 76 yuan to 726 yuan. Moreover, every household had electric lights and clean running water...

What force lifted this impoverished mountain village to new heights?

With questions and amazement, we climbed to the 1700-meter-high Baiyanzi.

In 1979, the production team leader, 35-year-old Han farmer Zheng Yongqun, was elected as the village party branch secretary.

At a village cadre meeting, Zheng Yongqun said, "Han and Tujia people, when the village gate is closed, we are one family. As long as everyone has a united heart, I don't believe Baiyanzi won't have 'gold'."

He publicly pledged, "If Baiyanzi doesn't throw away the begging stick within three years, I, Zheng Yongqun, will be removed from my position as secretary!"

Zheng Yongqun knew that action is more important than words. He first tackled a major issue: promoting hybrid seeds and plastic film cultivation technology.

When he heard about promoting plastic film corn, the mountain villagers were very reluctant. Zheng Yongqun and two committee members each set aside a plot of land for an experiment. After the harvest, the yield was 386 jin per mu, shocking the villagers into silence for half a day.

The next year, every household planted plastic film corn. Zheng Yongqun taught everyone how to make ridges, sow seeds, cover the film, and punch holes. By the autumn harvest, the village's per capita grain production exceeded 800 jin, ending 32 years of relying on subsidized grain.

The villagers were overjoyed, but Zheng Yongqun was not too happy. He thought, "The begging stick" was temporarily discarded, but the villagers' pockets were still empty. He considered that growing flue-cured tobacco was a way to wealth, urging the villagers to plant more tobacco. With the experience of plastic film corn, the villagers agreed to plant it, and a large area was quickly cultivated. However, unfortunately, that autumn, the county stopped purchasing tobacco leaves, and the tobacco farmers angrily asked Zheng Yongqun what to do.

"Everyone hand over the tobacco to me, and you just collect the money from me." Zheng Yongqun dared to take responsibility, immediately stabilizing the tobacco farmers' hearts. Zheng Yongqun led three village cadres to transport the more than 6000 jin of flue-cured tobacco to Hucheng, 300 li away, for sale. Five days later, the mountain villagers joyfully received stacks of new "big notes" from Zheng Yongqun. They counted on their fingers and calculated that the village's per mu income from flue-cured tobacco was over 700 yuan.

To help the villagers get rich quickly, Zheng Yongqun never dared to misuse a single penny of public funds.

In March 1987, Zheng Yongqun and the village head, Hu Xulong, went to Yichang City to purchase lighting materials for the village. Their pockets held over 8600 yuan, and the village had regulations: village cadres going out to do things for the people would receive a three-yuan daily subsidy, with accommodation fees reimbursed. However, they insisted on tightly holding and pinching every meal, eating a 50-cent bowl of noodles.

After purchasing the materials, they loaded the ton-heavy equipment themselves, saving seventy or eighty yuan just on this item.

Back in the village, Zheng Yongqun did not let Hu Xulong speak, reporting only the four-jiao daily accommodation fee and transportation costs, without claiming a single cent of subsidy.

A few months passed, and every household had electric lights, but Zheng Yongqun and the two committee members had collapsed from overwork. On the day of the power connection, the entire village, young and old, cheered and danced, with each household setting off firecrackers. Some young men pulled the electric lights into the courtyard and made a ruckus all night.

In Baiyanzi, our hearts were constantly stirred by something.

Was it the lush, neatly arranged corn, flue-cured tobacco, and sunflowers on the slopes?

Was it the dense, green artificial forest?

Was it the orderly distribution of yellow birch and chestnuts throughout the mountains?

Yes, and no.

The simple Tujia villagers said with deep emotion: "We have a good 'leader'."

　　土家山寨的好领班
　　李开文　谭炜焰
    在群峦叠嶂的鄂西山区，离宋代寇准劝农的野三关不远，有一个终年云封雾锁富有传奇色彩的山寨——巴东县马眠塘乡白岩子村。
    这是一个土汉杂居以土家人为主的山村，全村400多人，土家人占76％。多年来，这里荒凉连着贫困，是一个人见人愁的“三靠”村。
    可是没有几年功夫，这里却出现了奇迹，到1988年，全村人平粮食从1980年的276斤上升到1119斤，人均收入从76元上升到726元，而且家家点上了电灯，吃上了清凉干净的自来水……
    是什么力量使这个贫困的高山村腾飞起来的呢？
    我们带着疑问和惊奇登上了海拔1700米的白岩子。
    1979年，生产队长、35岁的汉族农民郑永群被选为村党支部书记。
    在村干部会上，郑永群说：汉人土家人，关上寨门是一家人。只要大伙一条心，不信白岩子没有“黄金”。
    他当众为自己立下军令状：“三年内白岩子不甩掉讨饭棍，就罢免我郑永群的书记职务！”
    郑永群懂得，行动比誓言更重要。他首先抓了一个狠着，推广良种和地膜栽培新技术。
    听说推广地膜包谷，山民们老大不愿意，郑永群与两名支委各腾出一块地搞试验。秋后一过磅，亩产386公斤，惊得山民们半天合不上嘴。
    第二年，家家户户种上了地膜包谷，郑永群手把手教别人起垅、下种、覆膜、打孔。到秋收，全村人均粮食超过800斤，一举结束了32年吃供应粮的历史。
    乡亲们乐了，郑永群却没有太高兴，他想，“讨饭棍”是暂时扔掉了，但乡亲们的荷包还没鼓起来。他琢磨种烤烟是条财路，号召群众多种烟，群众有了地膜包谷的经验，说种就种，呼啦啦搞了一大片。但事不凑巧，这年秋天，县里却停止收购烟叶，烟农们气呼呼找到郑永群问怎么办？
      “大伙把烟交给我，你们只管从我手里领票子。”郑永群敢于承担责任，一下稳住了烟农的心。郑永群带领三个村干部把收上来的6000多斤烤烟运到300里外的鹤峰销售。五天后，山民们从郑永群手中欢天喜地接过一叠叠崭新的“大团结”。他们掰着指头算了算，全村烤烟亩平收入700多元。
    为了让乡亲们尽快脱贫致富，郑永群从不敢枉花一分钱公款。
    1987年3月，郑永群和村长胡绪龙到宜昌市为村里采购电灯器材。他们的荷包里装有8600多元，村里也有规定，村干部外出为群众办事，每天补助三元，住宿费实报实销，可他们硬是紧把细捏每顿饭吃五毛钱一碗的面条。
    材料购齐了，上吨重的器材，他们自己装卸，光这一项就省下了七八十元钱。
    回到村里，郑永群不让胡绪龙吭声，只报了每天四毛钱的统铺住宿费和车船费，没领一分钱补助。
    几个月过去了，家家户户电灯亮了，但郑永群和两名支委却累倒了。通电那天，全村老少欢呼雀跃，家家户户炸响了鞭炮，一些后生把电灯拉到院坝里足足喧闹了一夜。
    在白岩子，我们的心始终被一种东西激荡着。
   是那满坡绿葱葱、齐刷刷的包谷、烤烟、向日葵？
    是那黑压压、绿油油的人工林？
    是那满山遍野分布有序的黄柏、板栗？
    是，又不是。
    朴实的土家山民深情地说：我们有一个好“带头人”。
