It might be hard to believe, but the main person in charge of an 800-mile forest, lives in a house with only two rooms; when going to the frontline, he often eats pickled vegetables with steamed buns with the loggers; when traveling on business, he doesn't take taxis, to save time, he doesn't wait for the sleeper car, he takes the hard seat; when staying, it is often in a dark basement... However, this is a fact that all the workers speak highly of. This nearly 50-year-old Communist Party member is Du Ywei, the director of Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau, the largest forestry enterprise in Heilongjiang, located by the Ussuri River.

At the end of 1986, Du Ywei concluded a deal worth 24 million yuan and 2 million US dollars with business representatives from Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and other countries in Beijing. During the 59-day negotiation, he and his colleagues stayed in a small hotel in the basement of a building in Beijing's Pingli. The hotel was so simple that it didn't even have a dining hall. Over the 59 days, he "consumed" two boxes of instant noodles. Taxis were everywhere in the capital, but every time he went to the negotiations, he took the bus. A superior leader came to see him, his face showing some admiration: "The director of such a large bureau lives here?" The director in charge of 14 forest farms told the superior: "I do this so that I can speak with authority." He felt that the forestry bureau was large, with many expenses, and there were still many places to spend money, so he had to set an example to call on everyone to increase production, save, and work hard.

Indeed, he is a good example. Working late into the night, the office wanted to send him home by car, but he waved his hand: "We are still poor, let's save some oil." The director's building was completed, but he didn't move in, instead, he arranged for old comrades and others to move in first. The office building was already damaged in many places, far from being as good as the small school across the street. Du Ywei and his colleagues decided that the money should first be spent on production, on building schools, roads, and staff dormitories, and improving the office building should be postponed. The director's exemplary actions became a silent order. In the entire office, saving money and doing more things became the norm. The forestry bureau has economic and technological exchanges with 16 countries, and there are many people going abroad, but very few people go abroad to buy new clothes. Deputy Director Wang Zhan Shan and three others went to Canada, and the expenses spent were less than half of the national standard. Party Committee Secretary Dong Guozhu lives in a house of only 12 square meters.

In October of the previous year, Du Ywei went to the Forest Railway Transportation Department to study work. At lunchtime, the table was full of alcohol and dishes. He insisted on having them removed, otherwise, he would not eat. Before leaving, he reminded them: "In the future, when you entertain me, a bowl of noodles with a spoon of vinegar will do."

He has not stopped criticizing excessive entertainment at meetings: "Putting out so many dishes, it doesn't look like living at home. Can you afford to entertain every day?" To stop the trend of eating and drinking, he led the way in quitting alcohol and set the rule of "not accepting invitations and not accepting gifts" for himself. Some units that purchase timber sent him "goodwill money," and he refused them all on the spot. Some units and cadres within the bureau sent him some soy oil and fruits, and he immediately returned them, or if he couldn't return them, he paid for them at the price.

Since Du Ywei became deputy director in 1982, 7 years have passed, and he has been busy with public affairs all day. During the spring prevention and winter transportation, he hasn't been home for ten days or half a month. Last winter transportation, he left home for 26 days. Household chores, he left to his wife. His children's studies, he never cared about. Therefore, both of his children did not get into college. Later, he sent his children to study abroad at their own expense. A well-meaning deputy director of the education committee, considering his situation, decided to reimburse 1,000 yuan for his children's tuition. Du Ywei found out and took the receipt from his children and tore it to pieces. Later, he told the deputy director of the education committee: "My children cannot be special."

Is it that he lacks fatherly love? No. For the sake of the children in the forest area, he volunteered to be the director of the education committee and the honorary principal of the first middle school and the second primary school. He often detoured to the school to visit teachers and students when going to and from work. The experimental primary school's classroom had poor lighting, so he allocated funds to build a five-story building for the school. Some students reflected that the road home was not good to walk on, and they often got splashed with mud by passing cars in the rain, so he allocated funds to build a five or six-mile cement road for the children. To improve teaching standards, he found ways to send dozens of teachers to universities for further study every year. To ensure that the forest area has successors, he sent batches of high school graduates to universities for training. He often said: "Human resources are more important than forest resources." Because of the good education, Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau has been evaluated as an advanced unit in enterprise education in the province twice.

　　事关廉洁无一小
　　——记黑龙江东方红林业局局长杜业伟
　　本报记者　武培真
    也许您难以相信，管辖800里林海的主要负责人，住家，不过二间平房；到第一线，常与伐木工人一起啃块咸菜就个馍；出差，不坐出租车，为抢时间，不等卧铺，乘硬座也要走；住宿，常是阴暗的地下室……然而，这却是职工们有口皆碑的事实。这位年近半百的共产党员，便是位于乌苏里江之畔的黑龙江最大的林业企业——东方红林业局的局长杜业伟。
    1986年底，杜业伟在北京与加拿大、联邦德国、意大利等国商务代表谈成2400万元人民币和200万美元的生意。59天的谈判中，他与同事是在北京和平里一家地下室的小旅馆里栖身的。小旅馆简陋得连食堂也没有。59天中，他“消耗”了两箱方便面。京城的出租汽车随处可见，可是每次谈判，他都乘公共汽车前往。一位上级领导来看他，脸上露出几分钦佩：“这么大的局的局长，就住这儿？”掌管着14家林场的杜局长告诉上级：“我这样做，说话才硬气。”他觉着，林业局家大业大花销大，花钱的地方还多着呢，号召大家增产节约艰苦奋斗，自己就得做出样子来。
    确实，他是好样子。办公到深夜12点，机关要派车送他回家，他摆摆手：“咱们还很穷，省点油吧。”局长楼盖好了，他不进，却优先安排老同志和其他人。机关办公楼已多处破损，远不如对面的小学校。杜业伟与同事们商定，钱，要首先花在生产上，花在建学堂、修马路和职工宿舍上，改善办公楼要从缓。局长的模范行动，成了无声的命令。在整个机关，少花钱、多办事蔚成风气。林业局与16个国家有经济技术交往，出国人员不少，可很少有人出国做新衣服。副局长王占山一行四人赴加拿大，所花费用不到国家标准的一半。党委书记董国柱，住房只有12平方米。
    前年10月，杜业伟到森林铁路运输处研究工作。午餐时，桌上摆满酒菜。他执意要撤下去，否则不吃饭。临行，他叮嘱：“往后，你们招待我，一碗面条一勺醋就行了。”
    他不止一次在大会上批评超标招待：“摆那么多菜，哪像居家过日子。天天有招待，招待得起吗？”为了煞住吃喝风，他带头戒了酒，并为自己规定了“请客不到、送礼不要”的规矩。有些采购木材的单位给他送来“好处费”，他都当场拒绝。局内有的单位和干部给他送来一点豆油和水果，他立即退回，退不了就按价付款。
    杜业伟自从1982年任副局长起，7年了，整天忙于公务，赶上春防冬运，十天半月不着家。去年冬运，一离家就是26天。家务事，他全扔给了妻子。孩子的学业，他不曾过问。因而，两个孩子都未能升入大学。后来，他送孩子自费上大学深造。好心的局教委副主任考虑到他的情况，决定给孩子报销1000元学费。杜业伟得知后，从孩子手中要来发票，撕得粉碎。事后，他向教委副主任说：“我的孩子，不能比别人特殊。”
    是他缺少父子之情吗？不是。为了林区的孩子们，他自荐当了教委主任和一中及二小的名誉校长，上班下班常绕道学校看望师生。实验小学教室光线不好，他拨款为学校盖了五层大楼。一些学生反映回家道路不好走，雨天常被过路汽车溅一身泥，他拨款为孩子们修了五六里水泥路。为提高教学水平，他设法每年送几十名教师到大学进修。为了林区后继有人，送一批又一批的高中毕业生去大学代培。他常说：“人才资源比森林资源更重要。”由于教育抓得好，东方红林业局两次被评为全省企业办教育的先进单位。
