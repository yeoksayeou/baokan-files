A spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department summoned French journalist Meyer of the Alsace News Agency's Beijing bureau today. The spokesperson pointed out that, after serious and thorough investigations by Chinese public security and judicial authorities, the allegation made by Meyer during the press conference held by Comrade Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee, and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau on September 26, that a Chinese female student had been arrested, interrogated, and raped, was entirely false.

The spokesperson criticized Meyer, stating that his actions "seriously violated basic journalistic ethics and created a bad influence," and issued a serious warning to him.

    我外交部新闻司负责人向法国一记者提出严重警告
    新华社北京9月29日电　外交部新闻司负责人今天召见了法国阿尔萨斯最新消息报驻京记者梅业，向他指出：经过中国公安和司法部门严肃认真的调查核实，他在9月26日江泽民总书记和中央政治局常委举行的中外记者招待会上所提到的一位中国女学生遭到逮捕、审讯和强奸一事纯属谣言。
    这位负责人指责梅业这样做“严重违背了起码的新闻职业道德，造成了恶劣影响”，并向他提出了严重警告。
