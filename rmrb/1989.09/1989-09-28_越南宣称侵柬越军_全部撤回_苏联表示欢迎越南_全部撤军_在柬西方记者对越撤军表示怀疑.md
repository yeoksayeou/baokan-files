Vietnam claims "complete withdrawal" of troops from Cambodia
Soviet Union welcomes Vietnam's "complete withdrawal"
Western journalists in Cambodia doubt Vietnam's withdrawal

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on September 26, Hanoi claimed that the "last batch" of Vietnamese troops invading Cambodia withdrew from Cambodia and returned to their country today. The Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper, *People's Daily*, hailed this widely publicized but internationally unrecognized "complete withdrawal" as a "major historical event."

Vietnam's propaganda agencies said that a final withdrawal ceremony was held in Phnom Penh on the morning of the 25th.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on September 26, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 26th, welcoming Vietnam's so-called "complete withdrawal" from Cambodia.

The statement from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Vietnam's alleged withdrawal as "another demonstration of Vietnam's respect for Cambodian national sovereignty," and claimed that it "created favorable conditions for Cambodian national reconciliation," and so on.

In the situation where Vietnamese troops have not truly "completely withdrawn" from Cambodia, the statement called on other countries to "stop providing arms to the conflicting parties in Cambodia" and for the Cambodian parties to "first stop the fighting."

The statement also claimed that the Soviet Union is "prepared to continue to make efforts to eliminate this tense hotspot in Cambodia."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on September 27, the Vietnamese authorities announced on the 26th that the "last batch" of Vietnamese troops invading Cambodia had returned to their country on September 26 in five routes. However, some Western journalists covering the situation in Cambodia raised many doubts about this so-called "complete withdrawal."

According to reports from Western news agencies, under the meticulous arrangement of Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime, more than 300 foreign journalists could only visit designated locations to cover this "withdrawal." A United Press International reporter reported that Vietnamese military vehicles were driving in circles. They saw the faces of Vietnamese soldiers at the farewell ceremony in Siem Reap yesterday, and today they saw them again in Battambang. In these two provinces in the northwest, where the fighting was most intense, there were no signs of Vietnamese tanks and artillery being withdrawn. Some Western journalists reported that in Kampong Cham, Vietnamese troops seemed to be stationary. In Kampong Som, where at least one Vietnamese naval division was usually stationed, only 700 naval personnel were announced to be withdrawn. On the banks of the Mekong River in Phnom Penh, there were only a few very dilapidated tanks and armored vehicles waiting to be loaded onto ships for transport. In addition, what surprised the journalists was that the Vietnamese authorities claimed that the troops withdrew in five routes, but they only allowed journalists to cover along Cambodia's National Highway 1, and not to other places. Therefore, the journalists had no knowledge of whether the troops in other directions had withdrawn.

    越南宣称侵柬越军“全部撤回”
    苏联表示欢迎越南“全部撤军”
    在柬西方记者对越撤军表示怀疑
    据新华社河内9月26日电  （记者凌德权）河内宣称，“最后一批”侵柬越军今天撤离柬埔寨回国。越共党报《人民报》称这次大事宣扬而不为国际社会承认的“全部撤军”是“一个重大的历史事件”。
    越南的宣传机构说，25日上午在金边举行了最后一次撤军仪式。
    据新华社莫斯科9月26日电　苏联外交部26日发表声明，表示欢迎越南所谓从柬埔寨“全部撤军”。
    苏联外交部的声明把越南的这种明撤暗留的所谓“全部撤军”说成是“再一次显示了越南对柬埔寨民族主权的尊重”，“为柬埔寨取得民族和解开创了良好条件”，等等。
    在越南军队并未真正“全部撤出”柬埔寨的情况下，声明却呼吁其他国家“停止向柬埔寨冲突各方提供武装”和柬埔寨各方“首先要停火”。
    声明同时宣称，苏联“准备继续尽力去消除柬埔寨这个紧张的策源地”。
    据新华社北京9月27日电据越南官方26日宣布，“最后一批”侵柬越军已于9月26日分5路从柬埔寨回到国内。但是在柬埔寨采访的部分西方记者对这次所谓“全部撤军”提出许多疑点。
    据西方通讯社报道，在越南和金边政权的精心安排下，300多名外国记者只能到指定的地点采访这场“撤军”。合众国际社记者报道说，越南军车拉着越军转圈子。他们昨天在暹粒市欢送仪式上见到了越南官兵的面孔，今天又在马德望市看到了。在西北部这两个战斗最激烈的省份，竟然看不到要撤走的越军坦克和大炮。一些西方记者报道说，在磅清扬，越军似乎原地不动。在磅逊港，通常至少驻有一个越军海军师，然而据宣布要撤走的海军只有700人。在金边市的湄公河边，仅有数辆十分破旧的坦克和装甲车等待装船运走。此外，使记者们感到“诧异”的是，越官方声称越军分5路“撤回”，但越方只允许记者沿柬境内的1号公路采访，不能到其他地方去。因此，其他方向的越军是否撤走，记者们一无所知。
