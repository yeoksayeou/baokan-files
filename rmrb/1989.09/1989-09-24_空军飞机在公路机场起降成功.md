The People's Liberation Army Air Force successfully conducted takeoff and landing operations on a highway airstrip for the first time.

Today morning, on the first highway airstrip in China, built by widening a section of the Shenyang-Dalian highway in Liaoning Province, three new types of domestically produced high-altitude, high-speed fighter jets and one Ilyushin-14 transport aircraft landed in succession. They then took off again, roaring into the sky. Performing single-aircraft landings and three-aircraft formation takeoffs on a highway airstrip, which is only half the width of a military airstrip, is a first in China.

    空军飞机在公路机场起降成功
    新华社沈阳9月23日电　（通讯员吕东浩、穆树乾）人民空军飞机首次在公路机场上起降成功。
    今天上午，在我国第一个以公路为基础加宽修建的机场——辽宁沈阳至大连公路上，3架新型国产高空高速歼击机和1架伊尔—14型运输机鱼贯而落，接着又呼啸着冲向天空。在宽度仅有军用机场一半的公路机场上作单机降落和三机编队起飞，在我国尚属首次。
