Sihanouk pointed out that the Cambodian issue is about resisting Vietnamese aggression and emphasized that he would only participate in negotiations, meetings, and conferences where the Vietnamese government is present, and would never participate in meetings among the various factions within Cambodia.

He said, "The Cambodian issue is not an issue between Cambodians; it is an issue between Vietnam and Cambodia, which is resisting Vietnamese colonialism."

In his statement, Sihanouk also said that he supports the possible convening of the third Jakarta meeting and the holding of the second international conference on the Cambodian issue in Paris.

	He said, "The Cambodian issue is not an issue between Cambodians; it is an issue between Vietnam and Cambodia, which is resisting Vietnamese colonialism."

	In his statement, Sihanouk also said that he supports the possible convening of the third Jakarta meeting and the holding of the second international conference on the Cambodian issue in Paris.

	Bangkok, September 22 (Xinhua) — (Reporters Huang Yong, Shao Linming) Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said tonight here that ASEAN will stick to its position of maintaining the seat of Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations.

	Siddhi made the above remarks at Bangkok Airport before departing for the 44th session of the UN General Assembly.

	He said that ASEAN is almost finished drafting the proposal on the Cambodian issue to be presented during the UN General Assembly.

	When talking about Vietnam's "withdrawal," Siddhi quoted Prince Sihanouk's words, saying that Sihanouk does not recognize Vietnam's withdrawal because there are still Vietnamese troops disguised as Heng Samrin's army remaining in Cambodia.

    西哈努克指出柬问题是抗击越侵略问题
    强调只参加越方在场的谈判
    东盟将维护民柬在联大席位
    新华社北京9月23日电  西哈努克亲王今天在这里发表声明说，在解决柬埔寨问题方面，他将只参加越南政府在场的谈判、会晤和会议，永远不参加柬埔寨内部各派之间的会晤。
    他说，柬埔寨问题不是柬埔寨人之间的问题，而是越南和抗击越南殖民主义的柬埔寨之间的问题。
    西哈努克亲王在声明中还说，他赞成可能召开的第三次雅加达会晤及在巴黎举行关于柬埔寨问题第二次国际会议。
    新华社曼谷9月22日电  （记者黄勇、邵林铭）泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉今晚在这里说，东盟将坚持维护民主柬埔寨在联合国的席位的立场。
    西提是今天深夜离开这里前往出席第44届联大会议前在曼谷机场回答记者的问题时重申上述立场的。
    他说，东盟准备在联大期间提出的关于柬埔寨问题提案的起草工作已接近完毕。10月2日东盟外长将作最后磋商。他表示相信，东盟的提案一定能通过，民柬在联合国的席位将会保持。他重申，泰国将承认大选前由柬埔寨四方组成的临时联合政府，承认大选后建立的柬埔寨合法政府。
    在谈到越南的“撤军”时，西提援引西哈努克亲王的话说，西哈努克不承认越南的撤军，因为仍有伪装成韩桑林军队的越军留在柬埔寨。
