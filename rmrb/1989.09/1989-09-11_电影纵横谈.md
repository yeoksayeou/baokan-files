Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Chinese cinema has undergone a decade of revival and development in the new era. Both in quantity and quality, there has been significant growth and improvement. This is primarily due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the active support of the broad audience. It is also the result of the united efforts of nearly 20,000 film creation and production personnel and approximately 500,000 people in the distribution and screening teams nationwide. In particular, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, we organized the production of a batch of tribute films, including feature films, animated films, documentaries, and educational films. In terms of ideological content, artistic level, themes, styles, and forms, these films have shown new expansions and achievements. We believe that these films, once released, will attract widespread attention from all sectors of society. Among these tribute films, some have undergone two or three years of planning and arduous filming. This process received the strong support and selfless assistance of people from all walks of life, including the military, factories, rural areas, schools, and various industries. Therefore, we should especially thank them, as it is their efforts and contributions that have been condensed onto the film by us filmmakers. In this sense, these films are a joint tribute to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

At the same time, we are also aware that film work still faces many difficulties and problems. For example, the film industry is facing a serious economic dilemma, and the ideological and artistic quality of films is far from meeting the growing aesthetic needs of multi-level audiences. Some inferior products are often subject to justified criticism from the audience. All these require film industry comrades to work hard and conscientiously, to build on achievements, overcome shortcomings, and create outstanding results.

Currently, the most strongly voiced opinion in society regarding films is the frequent appearance of scenes involving fighting, murder, and nudity in some entertainment films. The reasons for this phenomenon are complex. There is the influence of the overall cultural atmosphere of the previous period, the pressure on film production companies to make quick profits due to economic pressures, a one-sided understanding of the content of entertainment films, and the neglect of social responsibility by some filmmakers. This phenomenon not only faces criticism and resistance from the general audience but also has caused strong dissatisfaction among many insightful and aspiring film artists and actors. This issue deserves high attention from the film industry. The key lies in strengthening macro-control and guidance, and actively carrying out comprehensive management. Entertainment films with strong appeal should still be encouraged because they are what the audience needs and have unique and irreplaceable aesthetic value and social functions. However, we cannot focus solely on martial arts or suspense detective films when discussing this type of film, nor can we lower standards and rely on sensory stimulation to attract audiences. In this regard, content, themes, and styles need to be expanded. For example, comedies are very popular, but our achievements in this area are not yet commendable. Other genres such as social ethics and morality films, high-quality romantic films, musicals, science fiction films, etc., all require more effort. In summary, we should both encourage entertainment films with strong appeal and strive to improve their cultural level. The tone should be healthy and positive, avoiding shoddy production and pandering to popular tastes. We should correctly understand and handle the relationship between the entertainment function of films and their aesthetic and educational functions, gradually cultivating and improving the audience's aesthetic taste.

Regarding the educational function of films, it seems that this topic has not been discussed much in recent years. On the contrary, some film industry colleagues have recently emphasized the "new concept" of film, stressing the need to re-examine the nature of film, advocating that film is purely the externalization or venting of certain ideas or emotions of the creative subject, while neglecting the educational function of film and ignoring the audience as the receiving subject. I hold a negative attitude towards these viewpoints. We must seriously face the fact that during the previous period, when the tide of bourgeois liberalization was rampant, some of our theorists and creators, and some of our films, indeed reflected the serious influence of bourgeois liberalization. For example, the trend of national nihilism is a manifestation of bourgeois liberalization. Because of the desire for "complete Westernization," it is inevitable to deny our national identity. Some colleagues, when discussing film art, would inevitably mention Bazin and Kracauer, and be enthusiastic about stream-of-consciousness, non-dramatic, or new realism and new wave styles, while completely ignoring or dismissing the realistic tradition and achievements of Chinese film since the 1930s, not to mention learning from the excellent classical literary heritage. Regarding the "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy, there is a deliberate or unintentional one-sided and distorted understanding, emphasizing only the "hundred schools of thought" (actually not truly allowing diverse opinions, only allowing one's own views to be expressed while suppressing different voices), while ignoring the "two for," and ridiculing the advocacy of films reflecting the main melody as "official needs." Some colleagues equate the educational function of film with serving politics and discard it, viewing film only as a tool for the externalization of the creator's self-consciousness, thereby advocating the liberation of human nature, calling for the return of human nature, and further exaggerating sexual consciousness. The influence of this led to some films either being fabricated with sensational content, filled with sensory stimulation, or blindly imitating certain techniques from foreign films, being unassimilated, or from non-heroism to deliberately portraying male and female protagonists who combine the characteristics of ruffians, bandits, and hooligans. Some of these films and scenes in films naturally could not be shown to the audience. I believe that these phenomena, to a greater or lesser extent, are the result of the influence of bourgeois liberalization. Because their authors, to a certain extent, have deviated from the four cardinal principles, deviated from the Party's literary and artistic direction, and lost the serious historical mission and social responsibility that film artists should have. These problems need to be resolved through everyone's reflection, through criticism and self-criticism, to achieve unity on the basis of Marxist literary and artistic views.

In this process, we must distinguish between the influence of bourgeois liberalization and the introduction of foreign film theory and art. We must not, in the process of discarding dirty water, throw out the baby as well. On the contrary, for film to develop, it must absorb and learn from everything beneficial to us from abroad. Film itself is an imported art form, and there is no reason to reject learning from abroad. In fact, since the revival of film, the theoretical community has done a lot of meaningful work, especially in introducing foreign film theories, schools, and current situations, the achievements are obvious to all. This has broadened our horizons, enriched our knowledge, and activated our thoughts. What we should oppose is the uncritical, indiscriminate, and blind adherence to Western ideas, learning a little and treating it as a guiding principle, blindly imitating, or importing some philosophical ideas that one may not even be able to explain clearly, and then deliberately appearing profound in the film. This situation is also related to our past correct advocacy not being sufficient. Chinese film, after accumulating experience since the founding of the nation and continuous exploration since its revival, has now reached the stage of actively establishing our own Chinese film school. That is, based on the solid foundation of our national cultural and artistic achievements, inheriting and carrying forward the excellent tradition of realistic film since the 1930s, widely absorbing foreign film theories and artistic achievements, through appreciation, analysis, research, and criticism, absorbing everything beneficial, integrating multiple techniques, through digestion and transformation, making them our own, and integrating them into our own national forms and content that are popular with the broad audience. According to the socialist direction, serving the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, meeting the diverse aesthetic needs of the people, and gradually establishing a Chinese film school with Chinese style and Chinese characteristics. In this process, Marxist literary and artistic views will be our sole guiding ideology and theoretical foundation. Only in this way can we firmly stand among the world's films. Isn't it said that we need to establish a new concept of film? I think this is the fundamental content of our new concept of film.

There has been such a saying: the more national characteristics something has, the more it possesses universality. Film, as a spiritual product, is universal and comparable. Someone once compared film to "an ambassador in an iron box," which is a very vivid description. The export and import of film is a highly policy-oriented task and must be bidirectional. We not only need to strive for major awards at important international film festivals but also actively enter the international film commercial market and secure a place. This should be a long-term goal for the film industry. Our television stations broadcast several foreign films every week, and many foreign television series and animated series occupy our screens. Why can't our films go out as well? We should not always be satisfied with the "trade surplus" situation. As for winning awards at important international film festivals, many people have expressed indifference or even opposition. Of course, we cannot expect capitalist countries to give positive evaluations to our films with strong socialist tendencies. In this regard, we remain sober-minded. However, in the field of film art, they are still comparable and competitive, and we still have a place to show our strength. In fact, the competition at each international film festival is very fierce. Among the many competing films, no one will easily give the few awards to Chinese films. Our award-winning films are completely because they either reflect the unyielding and indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation or show the spirit of resisting aggression and unyielding courage, combined with outstanding artistic charm, that they can stand out among many competitors and win the laurels. There are indeed some backward aspects of life in them, but they are truly real. Precisely because they are real, they have caused different reactions from people in different countries with different perspectives.

In this era of deepening reform and opening up, it can be said that the management of the film industry, from production to distribution and screening, as well as the ideological orientation, artistic quality, technical standards, and management of films, we all face the task of continuing to reform, adjust, and improve. For example, in terms of the development of film production, it is known that if there are no restrictions, our current creative forces and production capacity can easily reach an annual output of 200 films. However, in the past five or six years, we have consistently controlled the output to around 150 films. This is mainly due to market conditions and economic difficulties in the film industry. Therefore, we insist on the policy of "stabilizing output and improving quality." The practice of recent years has proven that this policy is completely correct. I believe that in the next few years, we should still focus on improving the ideological, artistic, and entertainment value of films, while keeping the output of various types of films at the current level.

Someone has suggested that the restrictions on output should be completely lifted, allowing everyone to produce as many films as they can, and completely leaving it to the market to regulate, with the best surviving and the worst being eliminated. I think the actual problem is not that simple. First of all, we are currently establishing and improving a kind of economy that combines planned economy with market regulation. If we implement a completely market-oriented economy, abandon the guidance of the planned economy, and do not control the output, but leave it entirely to market regulation, it may not work. The best survives, that's fine; the worst is eliminated, what then? Let it go bankrupt, sell off its assets, and scatter its personnel, leading to unemployment? Therefore, the problem is not that simple. There is a series of problems to be solved, to ensure the quality of the products, to open up broad distribution channels, to improve the market mechanism, etc. This is also a systematic project. Since it is a systematic project, it must be comprehensively managed and cannot be dealt with simply. However, this does not mean that the current management method, which relies solely on product quantity indicators, is the best and does not need to be reformed. It should be said that the current management method based on indicators is a product of a closed market and low productivity. It can be imagined that with the prosperity of the national economy, the deepening of reform and opening up, and the improvement of film market conditions, in other words, with the changes and development of the sales side, it will inevitably feedback to the production side, causing corresponding changes in the management methods, that is, from the stage of management based solely on indicators, through the stage of equal emphasis on indicator management and quality management, gradually transitioning to the stage of complete quality management. That is, according to the production and creation rules of films as spiritual products, starting from the combination of social benefits and economic benefits, completely managing according to their quality—ideological quality and artistic quality. This is the film production management method suitable for the stage when social economy and culture develop to a higher level. Of course, this requires the gradual establishment and improvement of many measures from production to sales, and it will take time. We only have preliminary ideas in this regard and need to conduct detailed research and demonstration, including the establishment of certain external environments in the film industry as a prerequisite.

    电影纵横谈
　　滕进贤
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国电影经过新时期十年的复苏与发展，无论在数量和质量上都有很大的增长和提高。这首先应该归功于党中央的正确领导和广大观众的积极支持。同时也是全国近两万名电影创作生产人员和约五十万人的发行放映队伍团结协作，共同努力的结果。特别是为了迎接建国四十周年，我们组织摄制的一批包括故事片、美术片、纪录片和科教片等各个片种的献礼影片，在思想内容、艺术水平和题材、风格、样式等方面都呈现出新的拓展与成就。相信这些影片陆续公映之后，将会引起社会各界的广泛注意。在这批献礼影片中，其中有的是经过了两、三年的酝酿筹划和艰苦拍摄而成的。这中间得到了社会各界，包括部队、工厂、农村、学校和各行各业的人们的大力协助和无私支援才得以完成的。所以，应当着重感谢他们，是他们的努力和奉献通过我们电影摄制人员而凝聚到胶片上去的。在这个意义上说，这些影片是我们大家共同为建国四十周年献上的一份厚礼。
    与此同时，我们也清醒地看到，电影工作还存在着许多困难和问题，比如电影经济面临着严重的困境，影片的思想艺术质量还远远不能满足多层次观众日益增长的审美需求，其中一些低劣产品不时受到观众正当的责难，等等。这些都要求电影战线的同志们不断努力，兢兢业业地从事我们的工作，发扬成绩，克服缺点，创造优异的成绩。
    当前社会上对电影反映最为强烈的，是人们对一些娱乐性影片常常出现的一些打斗、凶杀和裸露的情节迭有烦言。这种现象产生的原因是比较复杂的。这里有前一个时期整个社会文化生活大气候的影响，有制片厂家迫于经济压力而产生的急功近利，有对于娱乐性影片内涵的片面理解，也有某些电影工作者对自身社会责任感的漠视。这种现象不仅受到广大观众的批评和抵制，而且也在许多有见地、有追求的电影艺术家和演员们中间引起强烈不满。这个问题值得电影界高度重视，关键在于加强宏观调控和引导，积极地进行综合治理。娱乐性强的影片仍然要提倡，因为它们是观众所需要的，有其独特而不可替代的审美价值和社会功能。但是，不能一提这类影片，眼睛就只盯着武打片或惊险侦破片，更不能降低品格，专以感官刺激去招徕观众。这方面的内容、题材、样式亟待开拓，我们的思路应当拓宽。例如，喜剧片就很受欢迎，而我们在这方面的成就尚不足以称道。其它如社会伦理道德片、品格高尚的言情片、歌舞片、科幻片等等，都有待于我们付出更多的努力。总之，对于娱乐性强的影片，我们既要提倡，又要致力于提高其文化品位，格调要健康，积极向上，克服粗制滥造的现象，更不能曲意媚俗。要正确认识并处理好电影的娱乐作用同审美作用、教化作用之间的关系，逐步培养和提高观众的审美情趣。
    关于电影的教化作用，近年来好像不大提及了。相反，前一阵子电影界的一些同志着力提倡电影的“新观念”，强调对电影本性的再认识，主张电影纯属创作主体某些意念或情感的外化或宣泄，而摒弃电影的教化作用，漠视观众作为接受主体的认同。对于这些论点，我是持否定态度的。我们必须严肃地正视，在前段时期，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的情况下，我们的某些理论界人士和创作人员，我们的某些影片，确实反映出了若干资产阶级自由化思潮的严重影响。例如：民族虚无主义的倾向就是这种资产阶级自由化思潮的一种表现。因为要“全盘西化”，所以就势必否定我们民族的东西。有的同志一谈到电影艺术，就言必称巴赞、克拉考尔，热衷于意识流、非戏剧化，或新现实主义、新浪潮等等，而对我国电影自三十年代以来的现实主义传统和它的成就和经验，则一概无视甚或嗤之以鼻，更不要说向优秀的古典文艺遗产汲取有益的营养了。对于“二为”方向指导下的“双百”方针，则有意无意地陷于片面的、歪曲的理解，只强调“双百”
  （实际上也不是真正的“百家争鸣”，只准自己一家之言的张扬，而压制不同的声音），却无视“二为”，把提倡电影反映主旋律的主张归之为“官方需要”而加以嘲讽。也有的同志将电影的教化作用和为政治服务简单地等同起来而加以摒弃，只把电影看作是创作主体自我意识外化的工具，从而张扬人性的解放，呼唤人性的复归，进而渲染性意识。影响所至，有的影片或者胡编滥造，充斥感官刺激；或者照搬外国影片的某些表现手法，食洋不化；或者从非英雄化走到着力塑造那些集流气、匪气、痞气于一身的男女主人公；甚至在颠倒黑白，歪曲历史，贬低革命领袖人物，美化反动统治阶级的政治代表。某些这类影片和一些影片中的这类情节理所当然的未能同观众见面。我想，表现于银幕内外的这些现象，或多或少地都是受了资产阶级自由化思潮影响的结果。因为，它们的作者都在一定程度上偏离了四项基本原则，偏离了党的文艺方向，丧失了作为电影艺术家应有的严肃的历史使命感和社会责任感。这些问题，需要通过大家的反思，通过批评和自我批评，求得在马克思主义文艺观的基础上的统一。
    在这个过程中，我们必须把向外国电影理论、电影艺术的借鉴，同资产阶级自由化思潮的影响严格区别开来，绝不能因为要倒脏水，而把孩子一起泼掉。恰恰相反，电影要发展，就一定要汲取、借鉴国外一切有益于我们的东西。电影这种艺术形式本身就是舶来品，尤其没有拒绝向外国学习的道理。事实上，自从电影复苏以来，理论界做了很多有意义的工作，即以介绍外国电影理论、流派、现状而言，成绩也是有目共睹的。这使我们开阔了视野，丰富了知识，活跃了思想。我们应该反对的，只是那种不加鉴别、不分良莠、一味以西方为马首是瞻，学到一点皮毛，就奉为圭臬，生搬硬套，东施效颦，或者趸来某种自己也未见得能说清楚的所谓哲理，就在影片里故作深沉。这种状况，是同我们过去正确倡导得不够也有一定的关系。我国电影经过建国以来的经验积累，经过复苏以来的不断开拓，现在已经到了积极建立我们自己的中国电影学派的时候了。那就是立足于我们民族的文化艺术成就的雄厚基底之上，继承并发扬三十年代以来的现实主义电影的优良传统，广泛吸收外来的电影理论和艺术成果，经过鉴赏、分析、研究和批判，汲取其一切有益的东西，兼收并蓄多种手法，通过消化和改造，为我所用，溶化进为广大观众喜闻乐见的我们自己的民族形式与内容之中，按照社会主义的方向，服务于建设社会主义精神文明，满足人民的多种审美需求，以逐步建立起具有中国风格和中国气派的中国电影学派。而在这个过程中，马克思主义文艺观将是我们唯一的指导思想和理论基础。只有这样，我们才能坚实地跻身于世界电影之林。不是说要树立电影的新观念么，我想，这才是我们电影新观念的根本内容。
    曾经有过这样一种说法，即愈是民族性强的东西，就愈加具有世界性。电影这种精神产品是具有世界性的，是可比较的。有人曾把电影比喻为“装在铁盒子里的大使”，这是很形象的一种说法。电影的输出输入是政策性很强的一项工作，它必须是双向的。我们不仅要在世界性的重要国际电影节上争取拿大奖，而且要积极打入国际电影商业市场，夺得一席之地。这应当是电影界长期为之努力的任务。我们的电视台每周都要播出几部外国影片，还有不少外国的电视连续剧和动画系列片占据着我们的屏幕，为什么不能让我们自己的影片也打出去？这方面我们也不能总是满足于“入超”的状况。至于说到在重要的国际电影节上拿奖，已经有许多人表示了不以为然甚或反对的意见。当然，我们不能期望资本主义国家会对我们具有强烈社会主义倾向的影片作出积极的评价，这方面我们是保持着清醒的头脑的。但是，在电影艺术领域，它们仍然是可以比较的，具有竞争力的，我们仍然有用武之地。实际上，每个国际电影节上的竞争都是非常激烈的，在众多的参赛影片当中，谁也不会轻易把仅有的几个奖随便授与我国影片的。而我们的获奖影片，完全是因为它们或者反映了我国百折不挠、坚韧不拔的民族精神，或者表现了抗击侵略、英勇不屈的民族气概，再加上出色的艺术魅力，才能够在众多的竞争者中摘取桂冠的。那里面确实也有些落后的生活面，但那毕竟是真实的。唯其真实，才在国外人士的不同视角中引起了与我们截然不同的反响。
    在我们这个坚持深入改革、开放的时代，可以说电影事业的管理，从制片生产到发行放映的产、供、销全过程，以及电影的思想倾向、艺术质量、技术水准和经营管理等诸多方面，我们都面临着继续改革、调整、提高的任务。即以电影生产的发展而论，众所周知，仅以电影的主要产品故事片而言，我国现有的创作力量和生产能力，如果不加限制，那么达到年产200部影片是不成问题的。但是，近五六年来，我们一直把产量控制在150部左右。这主要是因为受到市场条件的制约，电影经济方面的困难也是一个原因。因此我们坚持实行“稳定产量、提高质量”的方针。几年来的实践证明这一方针是完全正确的。我想，在以后的几年内，我们仍然应该把主要精力放在努力提高影片的思想性、艺术性和观赏性上，而将多类影片的产量基本维持在目前这个水平上。
    有人提出过这样的建议，即彻底放开产量方面的限制，大家能拍多少部就拍多少部，完全交由市场去调节，优胜劣汰。我以为，实际问题并不那么简单。首先，我们目前要建立和完善的是计划经济与市场调节相结合的一种经济。如果实行完全的市场经济，取消计划经济的指导，在产量方面不加调控，全部交由市场调节，恐怕行不通。优者胜，那好说；劣者汰，怎么办？让它破产，资产变卖，人员流散、失业？所以说问题恐怕并不那么简单。这里有一系列的问题要解决，要使产品质量有保证，要开辟广阔的发行渠道，要完善市场机制，等等，这也是一项系统工程。既是系统工程，就必须进行综合治理，绝不能简单从事。不过，这并不等于说，目前这种沿袭下来的单纯以产品数量指标为归依的管理办法，就是最好的了，不需要加以改革了。应该说，目前这种指标管理的办法，是一种只适应于市场封闭，生产力低下状况的产物。可以设想，随着整个国民经济的繁荣，改革、开放的深化，电影市场条件的改善，换句话说，随着销售一方情况的变化发展，必然要反馈到生产一方，引起管理办法的相应改变，即从单纯的指标管理的阶段，经过指标管理与质量管理并重的阶段，逐步过渡到完全的质量管理阶段。也就是说，按照电影这种精神产品的生产和创作规律，从社会效益与经济效益的结合出发，完全依照其质量——思想质量和艺术质量的高下来进行管理的阶段。这才是适应于社会经济文化发展到较高层次时的电影生产管理办法。当然，这需要从生产到销售的许多环节上的配套措施之逐步确立和完善，还需假以时日。这方面我们仅有初步的设想，还要进行过细的调研和论证，包括作为前提条件的电影界外部某些大环境的争取与确立。
