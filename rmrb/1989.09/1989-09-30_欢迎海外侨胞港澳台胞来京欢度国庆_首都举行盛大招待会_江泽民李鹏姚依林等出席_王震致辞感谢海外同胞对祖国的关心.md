A grand reception was held in the Great Hall of the People tonight to welcome overseas Chinese, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, compatriots from Taiwan, and overseas Chinese living abroad to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. More than 2,000 compatriots and friends from 46 countries and regions across five continents gathered to celebrate the National Day together. Vice Chairman Wang Zhen delivered a toast speech at the reception, expressing warm welcome and greetings on behalf of the Chinese government and people to the guests.

Leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, Wu Xueqian, Li Tieying, Qin Jinguang, and Ding Guangen, attended the reception.

In his speech, Vice Chairman Wang Zhen pointed out that over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our country has made significant progress in society, increased its national strength, and improved the living standards of its people. These historical achievements would not have been possible without the support and concern of overseas compatriots and friends.

Regarding the domestic situation after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Wang Zhen solemnly informed everyone that China's political situation is stable, the economic situation is good, and there have been no changes in the basic policies and guidelines in any aspect.

Wang Zhen elaborated on China's consistent policy towards overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. He said that China's policy towards overseas Chinese remains unchanged. We will continue to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, enhance friendly relations with overseas Chinese, and encourage them to contribute to the development of their host countries and to promote friendly relations between their host countries and China. He also said that China's policy towards Hong Kong and Macao, based on the concept of "one country, two systems," remains unchanged, and we are in the process of formulating the Basic Law to codify these policies. We sincerely hope that compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao will continue to uphold the tradition of loving the motherland, loving Hong Kong, and loving Macao, and contribute to the stability, prosperity, and smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland.

Wang Zhen expressed confidence that under the leadership of the third-generation leadership of the Communist Party of China, with Jiang Zemin at its core, all ethnic groups in the country will unite and strive to overcome all difficulties on the road ahead. The common wish of compatriots at home and abroad to revitalize China and reunify the motherland will surely be realized.
