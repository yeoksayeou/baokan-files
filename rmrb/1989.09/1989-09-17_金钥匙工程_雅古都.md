The "Golden Key" Project "Yakut" is a series of 43 key construction projects, the largest-scale series of projects ever funded by the central government to aid Tibet's development. The total investment exceeds 1 billion yuan. In March 1984, the central government held a work conference on Tibet, deciding to send engineering and technical personnel from Beijing, Sichuan, and 7 other provinces and municipalities to Tibet for construction. The requirement was that each project must be fully ready for use before being handed over. Therefore, these projects are called "Golden Key" projects by the people of Tibet. These projects include 10 energy and transportation projects, 8 tourism projects, 15 cultural, educational, sports, and health projects, and the rest are building materials, commercial, and municipal construction projects.

By early 1987, these projects were basically completed. These modern facilities, including hotels, hospitals, community art galleries, shopping malls, cinemas, sports halls, scientific experiment buildings, bus stations, and schools, have played an important role in improving the material and cultural living conditions of the Tibetan people and developing various construction projects. The broad Tibetan masses praise these projects as "Yakut" (Tibetan: good)!

　　金钥匙工程“雅古都”
    43项重点建设工程，是中央援助西藏建设规模最浩大的系列工程，总投资超过10亿元。1984年3月中央召开西藏工作座谈会，决定派北京、四川等9个省市的工程技术人员进藏建设，要求每项工程都是从准备到完全能投入使用才交付。因此它们被西藏人民称为“金钥匙工程”。这些工程中有能源、交通工程10项、旅游工程8项，文教、体育、卫生工程15项，其余是建材、商业和市政建设项目。
    1987年初这些工程基本建成。这些饭店、医院、群众艺术馆、商场、影剧院、体育馆、科学实验楼、客运站、学校等现代化设施，对改善西藏人民的物质文化生活条件、发展各项建设事业，起到了重要作用。广大藏族群众赞扬这些工程“雅古都（藏语：好）”！
