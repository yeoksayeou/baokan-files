According to a report by Uganda's _The Monitor_ on September 4, a highly malignant venereal disease that can kill a person within just seven days has been discovered in Uganda. Three cases of "Inguinal Lymphogranuloma" (IGI) have been identified in the country. An official stated that this disease is transmitted through sexual contact, affecting the male genital area and female breasts, and can cause severe pain leading to death within seven days. This disease has been reported in Europe and the United States, but it is relatively rare in East Africa.

    乌干达发现一种恶性性病
    据乌干达《邮报》9月4日报道，一种仅7天即可致人死命的恶性性病已传入乌干达。乌干达已发现三例“淋巴腹股沟幼芽瘤”（IGI）患者。一位官员说，这种病是通过性渠道传染的，危及男性患者的阴部和女性患者的乳房，仅7天即可令人疼痛而死。欧洲和美国已发现了这种病，但在东非尚属罕见。
