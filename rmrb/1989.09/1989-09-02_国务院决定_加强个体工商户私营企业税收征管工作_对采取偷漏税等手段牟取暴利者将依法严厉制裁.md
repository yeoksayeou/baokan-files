The State Council recently issued the "Decision on Strengthening Tax Collection and Administration for Urban and Rural Individual and Private Enterprises." This is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, to take effective steps to alleviate the contradictions of unfair social distribution, to increase state fiscal revenue, to adhere to the rule of law in taxation, and to strengthen tax collection and administration for urban and rural individual and private enterprises.

The "Decision" proposes:

1. Correctly implement the Party and state's policies and principles for developing individual and private economies. Under the premise of a public ownership economy, developing individual, private, and other economic components is a long-term guiding principle of the Party and state in the primary stage of socialism and must be consistently implemented. We must continue to encourage the development of individual and private economies as a supplement to the public ownership economy; advocate that, under the goal of common prosperity, some people can become rich first through honest labor and legal operations. We must, in accordance with relevant state regulations, protect the legitimate business activities and legal income of individual and private enterprises, and resolutely stop arbitrary levies and fees. At the same time, we must strengthen the guidance, supervision, and management of individual and private economies. All legal incomes obtained through lawful operations must be taxed according to the law, especially using tax and other means to regulate excessively high incomes to alleviate the contradictions of unfair distribution. Those who use tax evasion and other improper means to seek excessive profits will be dealt with according to the law and severely punished.

2. By the end of October this year, a comprehensive inspection and rectification of the tax payment situation of urban and rural individual and private enterprises will be carried out, focusing on inspecting and rectifying the implementation of relevant state regulations, as well as the business and tax payment situations of individual and private enterprises since 1988. We must strictly grasp the policy, insist on lenient treatment for self-reported problems, and strict treatment for problems found during inspections. Problems found during the inspection should be handled according to tax laws, with taxes to be paid immediately and penalties to be strictly enforced; for serious cases constituting crimes, they should be transferred to judicial organs for criminal responsibility. The specific implementation plan for the inspection and rectification will be formulated and implemented by the State Taxation Administration.

3. Strengthen collection and management to gradually realize the institutionalization and standardization of tax collection and administration for urban and rural individual and private enterprises. Through inspection and rectification, the following requirements should be met:

	(a) Individual and private enterprises must strictly operate within the business scope approved by the industrial and commercial administration, and any unauthorized expansion of the business scope will be considered illegal operation and will be resolutely investigated and dealt with. All levels of industrial and commercial administration departments should organize forces to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the business scope. For problems found during the inspection, depending on the severity, warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, and orders to suspend business for rectification will be issued, and in serious cases, business licenses will be revoked. For those operating without a license, they must be resolutely shut down.

	(b) Individual and private enterprises are not allowed to falsify information, impersonate state-owned and collective enterprise business licenses, or operate under the name of state-owned and collective enterprises (including township and street enterprises). Those who have done so must immediately correct the situation; if they refuse to correct it, the industrial and commercial administration department should revoke their business license.

	(c) Private enterprises and individual enterprises that have reached the specified business scale must establish accounts. The industrial and commercial administration department, after issuing a business license, should order those who are required to establish accounts but fail to do so to suspend business for rectification or revoke their business license. For those who establish false accounts, once discovered, they should be fined according to regulations and ordered to correct the situation within a specified period; if they fail to correct it within the period, their business license will be revoked and they will be dealt with seriously according to the law. In the future, the industrial and commercial administration department, when verifying licenses and conducting annual inspections, should include whether accounts are established as a check item, and for those who are required to establish accounts but fail to do so, they should be dealt with seriously according to regulations.

	(d) For individual enterprises that have not yet reached the specified business scale and have not yet established accounts, taxes should be collected according to the fixed amount method. Effective methods such as industry peer evaluation should be adopted to determine reasonable fixed amounts. After the fixed amount is determined, it should be adjusted in a timely manner according to the changes in business operations. When the income exceeds the fixed amount determined by the tax authorities, individual enterprises must actively report to the competent tax authorities to adjust the fixed amount; if they do not actively report, it should be considered tax evasion and be punished accordingly.

	(e) Individual and private enterprises must, in accordance with relevant state regulations, truthfully issue and obtain invoices and certificates in their production and business activities. Tax authorities should strengthen invoice management and ban all illegal operations without invoices and certificates.

4. All individual and private enterprises must, in accordance with the regulations, complete tax registration with the tax authorities within 30 days from the date of obtaining a business license. Individual enterprises that have obtained a business license but have not completed tax registration must complete tax registration with the tax authorities within one month from the date of this notice. All individual and private enterprises must actively declare and voluntarily pay taxes, and tax authorities must strengthen supervision and inspection. Temporary individual enterprises must also actively declare and pay taxes. Units and individuals with the obligation to withhold and remit taxes must strictly fulfill the obligation to withhold and remit taxes according to regulations and do a good job in withholding and remitting taxes.

The "Decision" also proposes to carry out extensive and in-depth tax law propaganda and education to improve the awareness of taxpayers to pay taxes according to the law. It is necessary to adjust and strengthen the collection and management forces and improve the collection and management methods. All levels of tax authorities should reasonably adjust the use of cadres to ensure the needs of the collection and management front line. All tax personnel must not show favoritism, accept dinners and gifts from taxpayers, or accept bribes. Relevant departments should actively support and resolve the transportation and communication equipment needed by tax authorities.

The "Decision" finally states that all levels of government and relevant departments should recognize that strengthening the tax collection and management of individual and private enterprises and guiding the healthy development of individual and private enterprises not only has economic significance but also has important political significance. The people's governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should designate a leading comrade to be responsible for this work. The industrial and commercial administration, public security, and other departments should take responsibility and actively support and cooperate with the tax authorities. All levels of banks should, in accordance with the various requirements of the "Joint Notice on Seriously Implementing the Decision of the State Council to Strengthen the Cooperation between Financial and Tax Departments" issued by the People's Bank of China and the State Taxation Administration, perform their duties.

    国务院决定
    加强个体工商户私营企业税收征管工作
    对采取偷漏税等手段牟取暴利者将依法严厉制裁
    新华社北京9月2日电　最近，国务院发出了《关于大力加强城乡个体工商户和私营企业税收征管工作的决定》。这是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，采取切实有效措施，缓解社会分配不公的矛盾，增加国家财政收入，坚持以法治税，大力加强城乡个体工商户和私营企业税收征管工作的一项重要措施。
    《决定》提出：
    一、正确贯彻党和国家的发展个体经济和私营经济的方针、政策。在以公有制为主体的前提下发展个体经济、私营经济和其他多种经济成分，是党和国家在社会主义初级阶段的一项长期指导方针，必须始终贯彻执行。要继续鼓励个体经济和私人经济的发展，作为公有制经济的补充；提倡在共同富裕的目标下，一部分人通过诚实劳动和合法经营先富起来。要按照国家有关法规，保障个体工商户和私营企业的正当经营活动和合法收入，坚决制止乱摊派、乱收费。同时，要对个体经济和私营经济加强引导、监督和管理。所有依法经营的合法收入都必须照章纳税，特别要运用税收等手段调节过高的收入，以缓解分配不公的矛盾。对采取偷漏税收和其他不正当手段牟取暴利者，要依法处理，严厉制裁。
    二、今年10月底以前对城乡个体工商户和私营企业的纳税情况集中进行一次全面检查整顿，重点是检查整顿国家有关规定的执行情况，以及个体工商户和私营企业1988年以来的经营、纳税情况。要严格掌握政策，坚持自查自报问题处理从宽，被查瞒报问题处理从严。对检查中发现的问题，要按税法规定，该补税的立即补交，该处罚的严格处罚；对情节严重构成犯罪的，要移送司法机关追究刑事责任。有关检查整顿的具体实施方案，由国家税务局负责制定，并组织实施。
    三、加强征收管理，使城乡个体工商户和私营企业税收征管工作逐步实现制度化、规范化。通过检查整顿，达到以下要求：
      （一）个体工商户、私营企业必须严格按工商行政管理机关批准的经营范围从事合法经营，擅自超出经营范围的，视为非法经营，坚决查处。各级工商行政管理机关要组织力量，对经营范围进行一次普遍检查。对检查中发现的问题，根据情节轻重，依法分别予以警告、罚款，没收非法所得，责令停业整顿的处理，情节严重的，应吊销其营业执照。对于无照经营的，要坚决予以取缔。
      （二）个体工商户和私营企业不得弄虚作假，冒领国营、集体企业营业执照，也不得挂靠到国营企业、集体企业（含乡镇、街道企业）名下经营。已经这样做了的，要立即纠正；拒不纠正的，工商行政管理机关应吊销其营业执照。
      （三）私营企业和达到规定经营规模的个体工商户，都必须建帐。工商行政管理机关在核发营业执照后，对凡要求建帐而不建帐的，应责令其停业整顿或吊销其营业执照。对建假帐的，一经查实，要按规定处以罚款，并限期纠正；逾期不纠正的，吊销其营业执照，依法严肃处理。今后工商行政管理机关在验照和年检时，要把是否建帐作为一项检查内容，对应建帐而未建帐的，要按规定严肃处理。
      （四）对未达到规定经营规模暂未建帐的个体工商户，按照定期定额的办法征税。要采用同行业评议等有效办法，确定合理定额。定额确定后，应视其经营变化情况及时调整。在收入额超过税务机关核定的定额时，个体工商户必须主动向主管税务机关申报调整定额，如不主动申报，应视同偷税予以处罚。
      （五）个体工商户和私营企业在生产经营活动中，必须按照国家有关规定如实开具和取得票证。税务机关要加强发票管理，查禁一切违反规定的无票证经营活动。
    四、一切个体工商户和私营企业都必须按照规定，自领营业执照之日起三十日内，到税务机关办理纳税登记。已领取营业执照而未办理税务登记的个体工商户，必须在本通知发出之日起一个月内，向税务机关办理税务登记。所有个体工商户和私营企业都必须主动申报，自觉纳税，税务机关要加强监督检查。临时经营的个体工商户，也必须主动申报纳税。有代扣代缴税款义务的单位和个人，都必须严格按规定，切实履行代扣代缴税款义务，做好代扣代缴税款工作。
    《决定》还提出，广泛深入地开展税法宣传教育，提高纳税人依法纳税观念。要调整加强征管力量，改进征管手段。各级税务机关要合理调整使用干部，保证征管第一线的需要。所有税务人员都不得徇私情，接受纳税人的请吃和送礼，接受贿赂。有关部门对税务机关所需征管交通工具和通讯器材应积极支持解决。
    《决定》最后说，各级政府和有关部门应当认识到，加强对个体工商户和私营企业的税收征收管理，引导个体工商户和私营企业健康发展，不仅有经济意义，而且具有重要的政治意义。各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府要确定一名领导同志负责此项工作。工商行政管理、公安等部门要切实负起责任，主动支持、配合税务机关。各级银行要按照中国人民银行、国家税务局发出的《关于认真贯彻国务院决定加强金融税务部门配合的联合通知》中的各项要求，认真履行职责。
