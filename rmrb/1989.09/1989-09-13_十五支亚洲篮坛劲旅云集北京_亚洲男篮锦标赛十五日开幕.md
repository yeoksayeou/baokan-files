Fifteen Asian basketball powerhouses have gathered in Beijing for the Asian Men's Basketball Championship, which will open on the 15th.

According to a report from our Beijing bureau by reporters Wu Huo and Chen Zhao: "The preparations for the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship are complete. We warmly welcome friends from various countries and regions in Asia and hope they will enjoy their 10-day stay in Beijing." This was stated by Yang Bozhen, secretary-general of the organizing committee, representing the Chinese Basketball Association and the organizing committee, at a press conference held this afternoon for domestic and foreign reporters.

The Asian Men's Basketball Championship, which began in 1960, is the highest-level competition in Asian basketball. Over the past 30 years, men's basketball in Asia has seen significant improvements. This championship not only sets a record for the highest number of participants but also brings together the best teams from across Asia.

According to Yang Bozhen, the six teams widely recognized as the strongest in Asia—China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Chinese Taipei—will all be participating. The intensity and excitement of the matches can be anticipated.

The competition will start on the 15th and end on the 24th. The 15 participating teams will first be divided into four groups for the preliminary rounds. The top two teams from each group will then advance to the next round, where they will be divided into two groups. The top two teams from these groups will then compete in a crossover to determine the champion. China will be in Group A with Thailand, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. Originally, Kuwait was drawn into Group A, and Bahrain and Syria were in Group C, but due to unforeseen circumstances, they could not participate. Therefore, Japan and India, originally in Group C, have effectively secured their spots in the next round.

This championship serves as a warm-up for next year's Asian Games. The Capital Gymnasium and the University Gymnasium (the main venue for the Asian Games basketball competition) will provide the best services according to the standards of the Asian Games, including the venue and the press center. It is reported that more than 100 domestic and foreign reporters will cover this championship, including 48 from Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Chinese Taipei.

　　十五支亚洲篮坛劲旅云集北京
　　亚洲男篮锦标赛十五日开幕
    本报北京9月13日讯　记者吴骅、陈昭报道：“第15届亚洲男子篮球锦标赛准备工作已就绪。我们热烈欢迎来自亚洲各国和地区的朋友们，并希望他们能在北京度过愉快的10天。”这是本届锦标赛组委会秘书长杨伯镛代表中国篮协和组委会，在今天下午举行的记者招待会上对前来采访的中外记者讲的。
    始于1960年的亚洲男子篮球锦标赛是亚洲篮坛最高水平的比赛。近30年来，亚洲男子篮球运动有了明显的提高。此次锦标赛不仅创下了参赛人数最多的纪录，而且汇集了亚洲篮坛的各路劲旅。
    据杨伯镛介绍，被公认为亚洲六强的中国队、日本队、南朝鲜队、马来西亚队、菲律宾队、中国台北队均派队参赛，比赛的激烈、精采程度可想而知。
    比赛从本月15日开始，24日结束。参赛的15个队先分四组进行小组赛，获前两名的队再分两组进行复赛，获前两名的队再经过交叉决出冠军。中国队与泰国、新加坡、沙特阿拉伯队分在A组。原来抽签分在A组的科威特队和C组的巴林、叙利亚队因故不能参赛，这样，分在C组的日本队和印度队实际上已获得小组出线权。
    本届锦标赛是明年亚运会前的一次热身赛，承担比赛的首都体育馆和大学生体育馆（亚运会篮球主赛场）将按照亚运会的标准提供最好的服务，包括场地和新闻中心等。据悉，前来采访本届锦标赛的国内外记者超过百人，其中日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾、新加坡、香港、中国台北的记者有48人。
