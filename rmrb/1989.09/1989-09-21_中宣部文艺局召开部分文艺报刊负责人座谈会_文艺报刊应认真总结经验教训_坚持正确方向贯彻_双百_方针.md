The Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Art held a symposium with responsible persons of some literature and art publications in Beijing on September 18. The symposium discussed issues such as adhering to the correct political direction and earnestly implementing the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

Bureau Chief Liang Guandi of the Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Art said at the symposium that during the study of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the broad readership and comrades in the literary and art circles had strong opinions about the wrong guidance and content of a few major literature and art publications during the turmoil. We need to calmly review and reflect, and seriously summarize the experiences and lessons. At the same time, to further implement the decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session, the current literature and art publications need to boost morale, correct the direction, and clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization. They should actively engage in theoretical criticism, promote literary creation, and earnestly implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. He hoped that the attendees would carry forward the fine tradition of Party criticism and self-criticism, link the actual situation of literature and art publications in recent years, turn the experiences and lessons into valuable assets for running the publications well in the future, and make our literature and art publications have a new look under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

At the symposium, the responsible persons of each publication reviewed and reflected on their own performance during the turmoil and discussed their future plans. The responsible persons of the Literature Department of the People's Daily, Wenyi Bao, Zhongguo Wenhua Bao, and Wenyi Pinglun made self-criticisms to varying degrees about the political direction errors in their publications and departments. The attendees engaged in frank criticism of each other and jointly summarized experiences and lessons. They had a heated discussion on how literature and art publications can adhere to the correct political direction and better implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

The attendees pointed out that literature and art publications are important opinion platforms. They not only bear the glorious mission of implementing the Party's literary policy and promoting literary creation but also play an irreplaceable important role in the overall opinion and ideological guidance. This turmoil has proven that literature and art publications indeed have an issue with opinion guidance. Some literary publications have always paid attention to adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, so they were able to maintain the correct political direction during this turmoil and were praised by the broad masses and literary workers. However, some publications lost their correct principles and stance in this political struggle, made political direction errors, and exacerbated the turmoil, causing a bad influence. Some newspapers published poems, essays, and literary reports that aligned with the turmoil, supporting the illegal organization of the Autonomous Federation of Students, and directing their attacks at the Party and the government; some used nearly full pages to publish various "statements," "appeals," and parade photos, adding fuel to the turmoil; some official newspapers of government departments did not accept the government's decisions, publishing various news and poems, putting pressure on the government; and some literary theory publications, even after the suppression of the riots, still published articles with political direction errors and advocating bourgeois liberalization. For these literature and art publications, it is an urgent and important task to resolutely and earnestly correct the direction of their publications.

The attendees believe that "it takes three years of cold to freeze three feet of ice." The reason why some literature and art publications made opinion guidance errors during the turmoil is not accidental. This is related to the fact that some publications have deviated from the two fundamental points in their guiding ideology over the years, passively or even resisting the central government's policy of opposing bourgeois liberalization. Therefore, to deeply solve the problem of political direction, the relevant literature and art publications not only need to examine the opinion guidance issues during the turmoil but also need to seriously reflect on and clean up the problems in the guiding ideology of their publications over the years. This is a very arduous task. To earnestly and not superficially, actively and not passively do this work well, it is of great significance for literature and art publications to adhere to the correct political direction in the future. Currently, literature and art publications should adhere to the correct political direction by following the requirements of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, clearly opposing bourgeois liberalization, strengthening the positive voice of the Four Cardinal Principles, organizing articles to criticize some representative views of bourgeois liberalization in the literary field, clarifying a series of ideological and theoretical issues confused by the liberalization trend, and actively encouraging and supporting new developments in creation and new explorations in theory, striving to promote the prosperity of literature, invigorate the national spirit, and enrich the cultural life of the masses.

The attendees believe that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization on literature and art publications and the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy are not contradictory but complementary. Eliminating the distortion and interference of bourgeois liberalization, correcting the political direction and guiding ideology, the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy will be better implemented. The "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy is to promote the prosperity of socialist literature and art and consolidate the socialist state, not the opposite. Literature and art publications should actively organize creation competitions and theoretical debates, and clearly support correct views, raise the main melody of our times, expand the Marxist ideological front through debates, and promote the healthy development of the entire literature along the socialist direction. We should oppose rigidity, continue to encourage exploration and innovation in literature, allow mistakes and different opinions in exploration and innovation, and advocate correcting mistakes. We should not regard mistakes in exploration and innovation as bourgeois liberalization, and at the same time, we should draw a clear line between using exploration as a pretext to advocate bourgeois liberalization. Literature and art publications should be open to all, expand the ranks of authors and critics, and not form small cliques, turning the publications into factional publications or the stronghold of a few people. We should increase unity on the basis of distinguishing right from wrong and work together to promote the prosperity of socialist literature.

At the end of the symposium, Deputy Bureau Chief Li Zhun said that literature and art publications must adhere to the correct political direction, especially the literature sections of Party newspapers and journals, the official newspapers and journals of Party-led literary departments and organizations, which must actively publicize the Party's literary policy, actively publicize the Party and the state's overall line and various policies, and resolutely implement the Party's major decisions. They must unite Party nature and people's nature, and strictly abide by the discipline of publicity. The editors of literature and art publications, especially the responsible persons, are organizing theoretical discussions and creation competitions on behalf of the Party and the government or on behalf of the Party-led literary organizations. They cannot use personal likes and dislikes or personal needs to replace Party policies, nor can they use the pretext of freedom of criticism to provide space for wrong views or even bourgeois liberalization, using various methods to suppress the publication of Marxist voices. They should strive to improve the political quality and professional level of the editorial and reporter teams, strive to discover and cultivate young and middle-aged writers and critics who adhere to Marxist guidance, and make greater contributions to the prosperity of literature and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. The symposium was also attended by the responsible persons of the Science, Education, and Culture Section of Seeking Truth, the Literature Department of Guangming Daily, Wenyi Lilun Yu Pinglun, and Wenyi Yanjiu, as well as some literary critics in Beijing.

    中宣部文艺局召开部分文艺报刊负责人座谈会
    文艺报刊应认真总结经验教训
    坚持正确方向贯彻“双百”方针
    新华社北京9月20日电  中宣部文艺局9月18日召开在京部分文艺报刊负责人座谈会，座谈坚持正确的政治方向、认真贯彻“双百”方针等问题。
    中宣部文艺局局长梁光弟在座谈会上说，在学习十三届四中全会文件时，广大读者和文艺界的同志对于几家主要文艺报刊在动乱中舆论导向和宣传内容的错误很有意见，需要我们冷静地回顾反思，认真总结经验教训。同时，为了进一步贯彻落实四中全会的各项决策，当前文艺报刊需要振奋精神，端正方向，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，活跃理论批评，繁荣文艺创作，认真贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针。他希望到会同志发扬党的批评与自我批评的优良传统，联系文艺报刊近年来的实际情况，把经验教训变成今后办好报刊的宝贵财富，使我们的文艺报刊在十三届四中全会精神的指引下，有一个崭新的面貌。
    座谈会上，各报刊负责人都对本报刊在动乱中的表现作了回顾和反思，并谈了今后的打算。《人民日报》文艺部、《文艺报》、《中国文化报》、《文学评论》的负责人就本报刊、本部门发生的政治方向错误程度不同地作了自我批评。与会同志之间还开展了坦率的批评，并共同总结经验教训，就文艺报刊如何坚持正确的政治方向，更好地贯彻“双百”方针进行了热烈讨论。
    与会者指出，文艺报刊是重要的舆论阵地。它不但在贯彻党的文艺方针，繁荣文艺方面肩负着光荣的使命，而且在整个舆论导向和思想导向上有着不可取代的重要作用。这场风波的事实证明，文艺报刊确有一个舆论导向的问题。有的文艺刊物平时就注意坚持四项基本原则，因而在这次动乱期间能保持正确的政治方向，受到广大群众和文艺工作者的赞誉。但是有些报刊却在这场政治斗争中，丧失了正确的原则立场，发生了政治方向错误，为动乱推波助澜，影响很坏。有的报纸发表的诗歌、散文和文艺报道配合了动乱，为非法组织高自联张目，把矛头指向党和政府；有的用几乎整版的篇幅，刊登各种各样的“声明”、“呼吁”及游行照片，为动乱火上浇油；有的政府部门的机关报，却不接受政府的决策，发表各种消息及诗歌，给政府施加压力；还有的文学理论刊物在平息暴乱之后，仍旧发出了带有政治方向错误、宣扬资产阶级自由化的文章。对于这些文艺报刊来说，坚决地认真地端正办刊方向，是一项迫切而重要的任务。
    与会同志认为，冰冻三尺，非一日之寒。一些文艺报刊之所以在动乱中发生舆论导向的错误，绝不是偶然的。这与一些报刊多年来在指导思想上偏离两个基本点的要求，消极对待乃至抵制中央反对资产阶级自由化的方针是分不开的。因而要从深层次解决好政治方向问题，有关文艺报刊不仅要检查动乱期间舆论导向问题，而且要认真反思、清理多年来在办刊指导思想上存在的问题。这是一项很艰巨的工作。认真地而不是敷衍地、切实地而不是浮面地、积极地而不是消极地做好这项工作，对于今后文艺报刊坚持正确的政治方向，具有十分重要的意义。当前文艺报刊坚持正确的政治方向，就要按照十三届四中全会的要求，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，强化四项基本原则的正面声音，认真组织文章批判在文艺领域中资产阶级自由化思潮的一些代表性观点，澄清被自由化思潮弄乱了的一系列思想理论问题，同时要立足于改革开放和现代化建设的实践，积极鼓励、扶持创作上的新发展和理论上的新开拓，努力推动文艺的繁荣，振奋民族精神，活跃群众文化生活。
    与会同志认为，在文艺报刊上进行反对资产阶级自由化的斗争与贯彻“双百”方针并不矛盾，而是相辅相成的。排除资产阶级自由化的歪曲和干扰，端正了政治方向和指导思想，“双百”方针会贯彻得更好。“双百”方针是用来繁荣社会主义文艺事业和巩固社会主义国家的而不是相反。文艺报刊要放手发动创作竞赛和理论争鸣，又要旗帜鲜明地支持正确的观点，高扬我们时代的主旋律，通过争鸣扩大马克思主义的思想阵地，推动整个文艺沿着社会主义方向健康发展。要反对僵化，继续鼓励文艺上的探索和创新，允许探索、创新中出现失误和保留不同意见，同时提倡修正错误。不能把探索和创新中的失误看成是资产阶级自由化，同时也要同以探索为名宣扬资产阶级自由化的谬论划清界限。文艺报刊要搞五湖四海，扩大作者和评论者的队伍，不要搞小圈子，把报刊办成为派刊或少数人的阵地。要在分清是非的基础上增进团结，共同为繁荣社会主义文艺努力工作。
    座谈会结束时，文艺局副局长李准说，文艺报刊必须坚持正确的政治方向，特别是党的机关报、机关刊的文艺版，党所领导的文艺部门和团体的机关报、机关刊，都必须积极宣传党的文艺方针，积极宣传党和国家的整个路线和各项方针、政策，坚决贯彻党的重大决策，都要把党性和人民性统一起来，并严格遵守宣传纪律。文艺报刊的编辑特别是负责人是代表党和政府或代表党所领导的文艺团体来组织理论讨论和创作竞赛的，不能用个人好恶、个人需要代替党的政策，更不能借口评论自由专门为错误观点乃至资产阶级自由化主张提供版面，用各种方法刁难、压制马克思主义声音的发表。要努力提高编辑、记者队伍的政治素质和业务水平，努力发现、培养中青年中坚持马克思主义指导的作家和评论家，为繁荣文艺，建设社会主义精神文明做出更大贡献。参加座谈会的还有《求是》科教文室、《光明日报》文艺部、《文艺理论与批评》、《文艺研究》的负责人和在京的一些文艺评论家。
