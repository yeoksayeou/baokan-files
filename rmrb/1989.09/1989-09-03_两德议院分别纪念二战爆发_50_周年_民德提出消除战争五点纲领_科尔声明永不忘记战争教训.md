The People's Congress of the German Democratic Republic held a special session on September 1 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. The GDR's Foreign Minister Fischer, on behalf of the government, proposed a five-point program for the elimination of war.

The five points are: to emphasize the continuation of the zero option plan for the complete elimination of nuclear missiles in Europe as a means to eliminate all means of war; to supplement and perfect disarmament measures with mechanisms that guarantee peace; to develop relations between the two Germanys, treating it as a factor for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and for the stability of the European peace order; to respect the post-war status, especially the existing borders of European countries; to eliminate differences between East and West, and to jointly build a "European house" while respecting various different social systems.

Our reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports from Bonn on September 2: Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of Hitler's formal launch of World War II. In a special session of the West German Federal Parliament, Chancellor Kohl, on behalf of the West German government, made a statement, expressing that the lessons of war must never be forgotten, and that the 1970 Warsaw Treaty will be honored, dedicating efforts to reconciliation with the Polish people.

The statement said that this war, in terms of the intentions of its instigators, was a ruthless war of genocide. Remembering the innocent victims means maintaining a hatred of war. It must serve as a permanent warning to us.

The statement said that especially in Germany, we cannot lose our memory of the past. For us, this is a heavy burden, but it also helps us to shape our common cause with a high sense of responsibility, and it is the premise for us to achieve this goal in the future.

The history before World War II tells us how important it is to stay vigilant. This lesson is still valid today. We all hope that the encouraging developments of today can continue. We will do our best to contribute to this, especially Germans have a special obligation.

Kohl's statement said that we are committed to mutual understanding between the German and Polish peoples, which is our duty and also in line with the wishes of the two peoples. The Warsaw Treaty signed by former Chancellor Brandt in 1970 took a big step in this direction. We will continue to adhere to the spirit and provisions of this treaty. In the preamble of this treaty, Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany unanimously expressed their desire to provide a peaceful future for the new generation that is growing up, and to create a lasting foundation for peaceful coexistence and good bilateral relations.

    两德议院分别纪念二战爆发50周年
    民德提出消除战争五点纲领
    科尔声明永不忘记战争教训
    据新华社柏林9月1日电  民主德国人民议院9月1日在纪念第二次世界大战爆发50周年而举行的特别会议上，民德外交部长菲舍尔代表政府提出了消除战争的5点纲领。
    这5点纲领是：强调要继续把全部消除欧洲核导弹的零点方案作为消除所有战争手段的途径；用保障和平的机制来补充、完善裁军措施；发展两德关系，把它作为不同社会制度国家和平共处和欧洲和平秩序稳定的因素；尊重战后现状，特别是现有欧洲各国边界；消除东西欧之间分歧，在尊重各种不同社会制度的情况下共建“欧洲大厦”。
    本报波恩9月2日电　记者江建国报道：昨天是希特勒正式发动第二次世界大战50周年纪念日。在昨天西德联邦议院的特别会议上，科尔总理代表西德政府发表声明，表示永不忘记战争教训，信守1970年签订的华沙条约，致力于同波兰人民的和解。
    声明说，这场战争就其发动者的本来意图来看，是一场惨无人道的种族灭绝战争。记住那些无辜的牺牲者意味着保持对战争的厌恶。它必须成为一个对我们的永久的警告。
    声明说，尤其是在德国不能丧失对往事的回忆。对我们来说这是沉重的负担，但这也帮助我们以高度责任感来塑造我们共同的事业，同时它是我们未来达到这一目标的前提。
    第二次世界大战之前的历史告诉我们，保持警惕有多么重要。这一教训至今有效。我们大家都希望，当今令人鼓舞的发展能继续下去。我们将竭尽全力对此作出贡献，尤其是德国人对此负有特殊的义务。
    科尔的声明说，我们致力于德国和波兰人民的相互理解，这是我们的义务，也符合两国人民的意愿。1970年由前总理勃兰特签署的华沙条约向这个方向迈出了一大步。我们将继续信守这一条约的精神和条款，在这个条约的前言里，波兰和联邦德国一致表示，要为现在成长起来的新的一代提供和平的未来，要为和平共处和良好的双边关系创造一个持久的基础。
