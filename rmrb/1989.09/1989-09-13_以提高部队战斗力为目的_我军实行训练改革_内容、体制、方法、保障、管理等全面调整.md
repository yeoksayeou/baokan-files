Military training in the People's Liberation Army is advancing through reform. Significant progress has been made in training content, systems, methods, support, and management, effectively enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops.

According to the General Staff Department, military training is a crucial component of the PLA's efforts to build a revolutionary, modern, and regularized force. It is the core of troop work during peacetime and has received high attention from the Central Military Commission. Over the past decade, the PLA has focused on improving combat effectiveness, aligning with the broader trends of national and military reform, and adapting to the characteristics and requirements of modern warfare. The PLA has vigorously carried out training reforms.

	•	Reforming training content to enhance the overall combat capabilities of the troops. The ground forces have adjusted the training content structure into four levels: individual soldier, small unit, combined tactics, and campaign training. The navy has divided training content into four levels: individual personnel, single vessel, fleet, and combined training, and three categories: officer, non-commissioned officer, and soldier training. The air force and the Second Artillery Corps have expanded the scope of tactical and technical training content.

	•	Reforming the training system to improve training efficiency. The ground forces have further improved the soldier training organization; the navy has established training bases (regiments) for new sailors and land service technical recruits and has set up vessel training centers; the air force has initially formed a three-tier training system of "flight academy—conversion base—combat unit" and has established specialized training organizations for major technical troops; the Second Artillery Corps has conducted trials to establish new recruit training organizations within combat units.

	•	Reforming training methods to enhance training effectiveness. A synchronized training plan system from company to division has been established; different levels of training procedures have been standardized; the approach of synchronized training among various arms and services, centered on coordinated training, and training methods characterized by verification and opposition exercises have begun to be widely adopted.

	•	Reforming training support to raise the level of modernized training. The PLA has developed a large number of advanced simulation equipment. Laser and electronic simulation equipment for real-combat training has expanded from land to air and sea; electronic teaching has become an important means of training; training funds, equipment, and ammunition have been standardized for support.

	•	Reforming training management to establish a regularized training order. Training regulations and systems have been strengthened, with regulations, statutes, outlines, textbooks, and various evaluation standards gradually becoming comprehensive; regularized training pilot programs have been organized to conduct beneficial trials for establishing a regularized training order and achieving scientific training; modern management experiences have been applied, including goal management, standard training, and introducing competitive mechanisms.

    以提高部队战斗力为目的
　　我军实行训练改革
　　内容、体制、方法、保障、管理等全面调整
    据新华社北京9月13日电　人民解放军的军事训练在改革中前进，从训练内容，到体制、方法、保障、管理等方面，都取得了明显成果，有效地提高了部队战斗力。
    据总参谋部介绍，军事训练作为我军革命化、现代化、正规化建设的重要组成部分，作为和平时期部队工作的中心，受到中央军委的高度重视。近10年，我军以提高战斗力为目的，顺应国家和军队改革的大趋势，根据现代战争的特点和要求，大力开展了训练改革。
    ——改革训练内容，提高部队整体作战能力。陆军部队以单兵、分队、合同战术、战役训练4个层次，调整了训练内容结构；海军部队将训练内容划分为单个人员训练、单舰艇训练、编队训练、合同训练4个层次和军官训练、军士训练、士兵训练3个种类；空军和第二炮兵部队，扩大了战术、技术训练内容范围。
    ——改革训练体制，提高部队训练效益。陆军部队进一步完善了士兵训练机构；海军部队建立了新水兵和陆勤专业技术新兵的训练基地（团），并组建了舰艇训练中心；空军部队初步形成了“飞行学院——改装基地——作战部队”3级训练体制，并建立了主要技术兵专设训练机构；第二炮兵部队在作战部队内进行了组建专设新兵训练机构的试验。
    ——改革训练方法，提高部队训练效果。建立了从连到师的同步训练计划体系；规范了不同层次的训练程序；以协同训练为轴线、各兵种同步训练的路子和以检验性、对抗性演习为特征的训练方法开始得到普及。
    ——改革训练保障，提高现代化训练水平。我军研制生产了一大批具有先进水平的模拟器材，激光、电子模拟实兵对抗训练器材已从地面发展到空中、海上；电化教学已成为我军训练的重要手段；对训练经费、器材、弹药实行了标准化保障。
    ——改革训练管理，建立正规化训练秩序。加强了训练法规和制度建设，条令、条例、大纲、教材和各种考评标准等训练法规、制度逐步配套；组织训练正规化试点，为建立正规化的训练秩序、实现训练的科学化进行了有益的尝试；运用现代管理经验，进行了目标管理、达标训练、引入竞争机制等试验。
