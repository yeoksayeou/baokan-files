When a couple's relationship breaks down and their marriage falls apart, they often become enemies, blaming each other and even resorting to physical altercations. Minor faults can become reasons for hatred. As a result, former loving spouses often turn into sworn enemies before and after a divorce. However, in the UK, if a divorcing couple seeks help from the Family Lawyers Association, the situation can often be handled appropriately.

The Family Lawyers Association was established six years ago and has over 1,500 family problem consultants who specialize in providing family counseling services, including divorce counseling. Currently, there are nearly 50 institutions in the UK that provide divorce counseling. These institutions are funded by society or individuals. The consultants are mostly graduates in social psychology and family counseling. The fees are reasonable, ranging from 15 to 50 pounds per hour. In addition to face-to-face consultations, these institutions also offer mail and telephone consultations, which are very convenient for clients. Most of them work closely with the courts.

These counseling institutions mainly provide the following services: First, they help clients mend their relationship. Divorce is painful for both parties and often leads to social instability, causing trauma to children. Family consultants usually patiently understand the clients' marital situation and then provide targeted advice to mend the relationship between the couple, offering specific suggestions for improvement. Second, they help clients file for divorce legally. The UK courts base their divorce rulings on the 1969 "Divorce Reform Act," which includes the following conditions: one party has committed adultery; one party has unreasonable and bizarre behavior; one party has abandoned the other for two years; both parties agree to separate for two years; or one party has been separated for five years without the other's agreement. For those who want to divorce but do not meet the above five conditions, the consultants advise them to reconsider their decision, improve their marriage, and analyze the reasons for their incompatibility. Third, for clients whose reasons for divorce are valid and whose relationship has genuinely broken down, the consultants help them part ways amicably. This is quite challenging. Firstly, some couples, in order to achieve their divorce goals or to save face, arbitrarily interpret the second condition of the "Divorce Reform Act," exaggerating minor issues or occasional mistakes (such as forgetting to close the toothpaste cap or not remembering each other's birthday) into unreasonable and bizarre behavior and making baseless accusations. In such cases, the consultants work with both parties and draft the lawsuit for one of them, avoiding accusatory language as much as possible. Secondly, divorcing couples often have disputes over who the children will live with and how the property will be divided. The consultants, based on the principles of the children's physical and mental health and fairness, patiently mediate, making both parties happy and allowing them to part ways amicably.

These divorce counseling institutions are highly regarded for their quality service, good attitude, and reasonable fees, effectively helping those who want to divorce. Therefore, they are very popular, with a constant stream of visitors. A consultant happily said, "Many couples in the divorce process but still living together say that our counseling room is the only place where they can talk in a civilized manner."

Some social psychologists are calling on the UK government to provide more enthusiastic support for the family counseling service industry. The director of the Family and Community Conflict Research Center at the renowned Newcastle University, Jane Walker, is advocating for the establishment of a national marriage counseling network to coordinate and promote this work, making the entire society pay more attention to it.

　　英国的婚姻咨询服务
　　陈方明
    当一对夫妇感情破裂婚姻解体之际，夫妇间往往反目为仇，开始相互指责甚至殴打，对方的小错也会成为憎恨的口实。这样在离婚前后，昔日的恩爱夫妻往往成为仇敌。然而，在英国，倘若离婚夫妇得到家庭法律师协会的帮助，那就有可能使事情得到妥善地处理。
    家庭法律师协会是6年前成立的，拥有1500余名家庭问题咨询专家，专门提供家庭咨询服务，其中也包括离婚咨询。目前，英国有提供离婚咨询的机构近50个，这些机构的经费由社会或个人资助。咨询专家多为社会心理学、家庭咨询学专业的毕业生。收费标准比较合理，每小时15英镑到50英镑。除提供当面咨询外，这些机构还提供通信咨询和电话咨询，对顾客来说，极为方便。它们大多数与法院密切配合。
    这些咨询机构主要为顾客提供以下服务：第一，帮助顾客尽量弥合感情。离婚对夫妇双方而言，毕竟是痛苦的，而且往往会造成社会的不稳定，还会给孩子带来创伤。家庭咨询专家往往要耐心了解顾客的婚姻情况，然后对症下药，尽量弥补双方的感情，提供具体的改善建议。第二，帮助顾客依法提出离婚。英国法院判决离婚案，均以1969年颁布的《离婚改革法》为准，即：一方有通奸行为；一方有无理怪诞行为举止；一方抛弃另一方满两年；经双方同意后分居满两年；未经双方同意但分居5年。对凡想离婚但不合上述5条者，咨询专家则建议其打消离婚念头，设法改善婚姻，并分析彼此不合的原因。第三，对理由充足、感情确已破裂的顾客，咨询专家则设法让其圆满而友好地分手。这一点做起来相当棘手。首先，有的夫妻为了达到离婚目的，或为了挽回自己的面子，对《离婚改革法》中的第二条离婚标准任意解释，故意将配偶鸡毛蒜皮的小事或偶犯的过失（如忘记拧上牙膏盖、记不住对方的生日）夸大成无理怪诞行为而大肆指责，遇到这种情况，咨询专家一方面给双方做工作，一方面为其中的一方起草起诉书，尽量避免责怪性语言；其次，离婚夫妇往往容易在孩子跟谁生活、财产怎样分配上产生纠纷。咨询专家本着利于孩子身心健康、公平合理原则，耐心调解，使当事人双方心情愉快，和睦分手。
    由于这些离婚咨询机构服务质量高，态度好、收费合理，能为想离婚者排忧解愁，因此颇受欢迎，整天门庭若市。一位咨询专家欣喜地说：“许多处在离婚阶段但仍住在一起的夫妇说，我们的咨询室是他们能够用文明方式讲话的唯一地方。”
    一些社会心理学家正在呼吁英国政府更加热情的支持家庭咨询服务业，著名的纽卡斯尔大学家庭和社
  区纠纷研究中心主任简·沃克正在倡议建立一个全国性的婚姻咨询网进行协调和宣传，使全社会都重视这项工作。
