Jianghe County is located in the central part of Jilin Province.

On July 20th and 21st, the sky seemed to have been torn open, with torrential rain pouring non-stop. "Jianghe is flooding!" This was the most severe flood Jianghe County had experienced since 1909. Three landslides occurred, and vast areas of rivers surged forward like a tidal wave. Out of the county's 18 townships, 17 were severely affected. 212 villages were submerged, 18,000 people were trapped by the floodwaters, 3,726 houses collapsed, 400,000 mu of farmland was destroyed, and 22 people lost their lives.

480,000 people called out: Jianghe is in danger!!!

At around 7 AM on July 22nd, soldiers in green uniforms braved the heavy rain and waded through waist-deep water to rush to the most dangerous and critical areas that needed rescue.

The leadership of a certain artillery brigade of the stationed troops quickly formed a cohesive force, becoming the backbone of the flood control command. Brigade Commander Xie Yingxiang, despite the rain and water, inspected the disaster situation and decisively prioritized rescuing the people, blocking the breaches, protecting the town, and repairing the disrupted railway. He received support from the county leadership. He commanded the troops in the water for two days and nights, narrowly escaping being swept away by the flood three times, each time pulled back by his bodyguard. His legs were cut, his legs swollen from the water, his lips purple, his entire body without a single dry piece of clothing. Wherever there was danger, urgency, or hardship, he would appear in the floodwaters, braving the wind and rain to timely and correctly handle various emergency situations.

Political Commissar Zheng Yuancheng stayed by the telephone and military map day and night, overseeing the entire situation, deploying troops. Before each batch of troops set out, he would personally mobilize them. Under his direction, orders, political work instructions, rescue and treatment of casualties, and decisions to learn from the flood-fighting heroes were issued to the troops, timely guiding the flood-fighting and rescue battle.

Jianghe Town has a population of 50,000, including important factories and enterprises such as a power plant, a central radio relay station, and the second-largest substation in the province. If it were to be flooded, the consequences would be unimaginable.

At 7 AM on the 22nd, the training camp commander Sun Yunjun of the artillery brigade led 114 soldiers to rush to the scene. Without any flood-fighting materials, he immediately decided to cut down more than 40 large trees to block the water's impact. After the sandbags arrived, the soldiers jumped into the water, forming a human wall to stack the sandbags. After more than 12 hours of fierce battle, they finally rebuilt the damaged embankment. At 7 AM on the 23rd, the repaired embankment encountered another crisis. The soldiers jumped into the water again, driving 100 stakes and widening the 150-meter embankment by 2 meters. At 6 AM on the 24th, the entire camp of soldiers rushed to the upstream section of the power plant, fighting for 14 hours on the Jiangnai Road, and finally saved Jianghe Town.

At around 7 AM on the 22nd, the 214-kilometer mark of the Changtu Railway was washed away by the flood, with a 25-meter section of the railway bridge base destroyed and a 5-meter-high massive bridge pier displaced; the 231 and 277 sections of the Changtu line had three railway culverts washed away, measuring 25 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 5 meters deep, with the rails suspended in the air.

The stationed troops immediately dispatched more than 300 soldiers to repair the damage. Over 100 soldiers were injured by falling rocks and cuts. Soldier Wang Deming's right palm was cut open, but he wrapped it with a handkerchief and continued fighting. After the battle, his wound required 16 stitches. After more than 30 hours of intense struggle, the Changtu line, which had been disrupted for 50 hours and 30 minutes, was finally reopened.

At 6 PM on the 22nd, a heart-pounding battle to save people's lives from the flood began.

At around 6 PM, the water in Xinli Village on the north bank of Jianghe had been rising for more than ten hours. 86 houses were washed away, and more than 400 people were standing on the roofs, shouting for help towards Jianghe Town. Six soldiers from the stationed troops, including Major Wang Yanshiang, Lieutenant Jiang Suide, and soldiers Zhang Xiaobin, Qin Yongtang, Jiang Xuechun, and Wang Shengming, along with 18 rescue team members, boarded three rafts and headed towards Xinli Village. The raging floodwaters overturned the rafts, and 24 brave soldiers fell into the water. Six soldiers sacrificed their lives. Soldier Chen Xiaodong, to protect the safety of dozens of families outside the dike, fought bravely against the floodwaters but was unfortunately swept away and gave his life...

After three days and nights of intense battle, the entire brigade rescued and relocated 4,550 people, salvaged valuable items worth over 100 million yuan, bankbooks, and over 190,000 yuan in cash, repaired and reinforced 10 breaches and dikes, totaling 860 meters, and repaired and reinforced 7 road and railway bridges.

At noon on the 29th, the training platoon was repairing the breached dike in the western part of the town. Suddenly, a fire broke out a mile away at the rubber products factory. Deputy Platoon Leader Chen Lianfu led the mud-covered soldiers into the fire scene. After more than two hours of fierce battle, the fire was extinguished, and products worth over 150,000 yuan were rescued.

As night fell on the 22nd, the training camp soldiers continued to work tirelessly to repair the Jiangnai Road. The accountant Xu Liqui of the Fourth Gold Star Team, along with villagers Lu Changqing and Jia Baochun, found the troops and specifically asked if the troops had eaten. Upon learning that the troops had not had a single dry meal in over 10 hours, they hurried back. Xu Liqui took out 75 jin of rice from his home, prepared meals, and at around 9 PM, pushed a cart with bowls and chopsticks, delivering hot meals to the soldiers.

Jianghe County decided to build a revolutionary martyrs' monument for the seven soldiers who sacrificed their lives to rescue the people. Let the revolutionary martyrs' monument for those who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Jianghe and the flood-fighting martyrs' monument stand forever in the hearts of 480,000 people.

    劲旅锁蛟龙

    蛟河县位于吉林省中部。
    7月20日、21日，天像捅开了一个大洞，暴雨哗哗下个不停。“蛟河发大水了！”
    这是1909年以来蛟河县发生的特大洪灾，三处山体滑坡，大面积的河流以排山倒海之势倾斜扑来。全县18个乡镇，有17个严重受灾，212个村屯被淹，1.8万人被洪水围困，倒塌房屋3726间，毁坏良田40多万亩，亡22人。
    48万人民呼唤：蛟河告急！！！
    7月22日7时许，身着绿色军装的官兵，顶着瓢泼大雨，涉着齐腰深的水奔赴一处处最危险、最需要抢救的地方。
    驻军某部炮兵旅领导迅速形成合力，成为指挥抗洪的坚强班子，旅长谢英翔冒雨涉水察看灾情，果断把抢救群众、堵决口、保城镇、抢修中断的铁路做为重点任务，得到了县领导的支持。他在水中指挥部队抢险两天两夜，三次被洪水险些冲走，都让警卫员及时拉住。他的腿被划破口子，水把双腿泡得“刷白”，嘴唇发紫，浑身没一件干衣服，哪里危险、哪里紧急、哪里艰苦，他就顶着风雨在洪水中出现，及时正确处理各种危急情况。
    政委郑元成昼夜守在电话机、军用地图旁，纵观全局，调兵遣将，每出发一批部队，他都要亲自动员。在他的口述下，动员令、政治工作指示，伤亡抢救、开展向抗洪抢险勇士学习决定，一份份命令、指示传到部队，及时指导了抗洪抢险战斗。
    蛟河镇有5万人，有发电厂、中央电台差转站、全省第二大变电所等重要工厂、企业。一旦被淹，后果不堪设想。
    22日上午炮兵旅教导营长孙运俊，率领114名官兵火速赶到。在没任何抗洪物资的情况下，他立即决定伐倒40多棵大树，阻挡水的冲击。草袋运到后，官兵跃入水中，排成人墙，垒砂石袋，经过12个多小时的奋战，终于把冲毁的路基重新筑起。23日上午7时，抢修过的路基再次出现险情。官兵又跳进水中，打桩100多个，把150米的路基加宽2米。24日6时，全营官兵赶到电厂路段上游，突击14个多小时，在蛟奶公路苦战，终于保住了蛟河镇。
    22日7时许，长图铁路214公里处拉法铁路桥路基被洪水冲跨25米，5米高的巨大桥墩移位；长图线231和277段，有三处铁路涵洞被冲垮，长25米、宽6米、深5米，铁轨架空。
    驻军某部立即派300多名官兵投入抢修。100多名官兵身上被石头砸伤、划伤。战士王德军右手掌被划破，他用手绢一缠，继续战斗，战斗结束后，伤口缝了16针。经30多小时的紧张拚搏，终于使中断50小时30分的长图线通车。
    22日一场惊心动魄的与洪水争夺群众生命的战斗打响了。
    晚6时许，位于蛟河北岸的新立屯进水已达十多个小时，被洪水冲走86间房，400多名群众站在房顶上，向蛟河镇呼喊救命。驻军某部运输科副营职助理员王延祥少校、排长姜随德中尉、战士张晓滨、秦永堂、姜学春、王胜明六位同志随18名抢救群众突击队，乘三个木筏向新立屯漂去。奔腾咆哮的蛟龙发怒了，把木筏打翻，24名勇士落水，6名同志壮烈牺牲。战士陈晓东为了保护堤外数十家群众生命安全，与洪水进行英勇搏斗，不幸被洪水卷走，光荣献身……
    全旅官兵经过三昼夜的鏖战，救出和转移群众4550余人，抢出各种贵重物品价值上百万元，存折和人民币19万余元，堵口修堤10处，共860延长米，抢修、加固公路铁路桥7座。
    29日中午，司训连正在镇西抢修决口的堤坝。突然一里外的橡塑制品厂燃起了大火。代连长陈连福中尉，带领满身泥巴的官兵冲进火场，经过2个多小时的激战，火扑灭了，抢救出价值15万余元的产品。
    22日夜幕渐渐降临，教导营官兵继续苦战抢修蛟奶公路。金星四队会计徐立奎领着村民卢长庆、贾宝春摸到部队，专门询问部队是否吃饭，当得知部队10多个小时没有吃上一口干粮时，便急匆匆赶回。徐立奎把家中的75斤大米拿出，做好饭菜，晚九点多，推着小车，带着碗筷，把热乎乎饭菜送到官兵手里。
    蛟河县决定对抢救群众牺牲的7名官兵修建革命烈士纪念碑。让为解放蛟河而牺牲的拉法山革命烈士纪念碑和抗洪烈士纪念碑，永远耸立在48万人民心中。
