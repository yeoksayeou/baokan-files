Our county is a poor mountainous area with limited arable land and resources. For a period, due to the imperfect approval procedures for private housing construction, unauthorized approvals, excessive land allocation, and illegal occupation of arable land frequently occurred. To protect arable land, the county committee and the county government decided to increase the transparency of land approval procedures and adopted measures such as public listing, democratic evaluation, and public supervision. When villagers apply to build private houses, the village committee must publicly list the applicant's reasons, family population, age, housing conditions, and the area of land use for the house, and let the public evaluate it. Based on the initial public evaluation, the village committee and the village party branch must collect and synthesize public opinions, discuss the list of applicants within the control index, and present specific opinions. The list is then publicly listed for the second time and submitted to the village assembly and the village representative assembly for review. The review results are publicly listed for the third time. After the review is passed, the village representatives sign and stamp the approved housing applicants.

These measures have been very effective in stopping various illegal occupations of arable land for housing construction.

　　列榜公布　民主评议
　  壶关县审批村民个人建房透明度强
    我县是个贫困山区，耕地、资源比较紧缺，一个时期以来，由于建私房的审批程序不够完善，越权审批、少批多占、抢占侵占耕地的现象屡屡发生。为了保护好耕地，县委、县政府决定增加土地审批程序的透明度，采取了列榜公布、民主评议、群众监督等措施。有的村民申请建私房，村委会要将建房者的申请理由、家庭人口、年龄、住房情况和宅基地使用面积等列榜公布于众，让群众评议；在群众初评的基础上，村委会和村党支部要收集、综合群众意见，按控制指标数，讨论建房者名单，拿出具体意见，二榜公布于众，然后提交村民大会和村民代表大会审议，并将审议结果进行三榜公布，经审议通过的建房户，由村民代表签字盖章。
    这些措施出台后，对制止各种非法占用耕地建房十分有利。
