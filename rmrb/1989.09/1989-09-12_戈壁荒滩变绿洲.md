In the mid-autumn season, we traveled by car along the Gobi Desert's sand control line, seeing dense and continuous shelterbelts stretching like "green dragons" into the distance, effectively blocking the once rampant "yellow sand dragons." The network of canals, roads, forests, and fields has turned the vast farmlands into a grid of green patches. Newly built peasant houses, along with power lines and the ancient Great Wall, are scattered amidst the green waves...

Surrounded by the Badain Jaran Desert on three sides and relying on snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains for irrigation, Gaotai County has seen a steady increase in grain production over the past decade. The county has achieved a virtuous cycle of human progress, sand retreat, lush forests, abundant grain, thriving livestock, and coordinated development. The average grain yield per mu has exceeded 550 kilograms, with over 60 million kilograms of commercial grain provided to the state and society annually, and a commercial grain rate of 58.8%.

The county has consistently promoted various types and forms of intercropping on a large scale, optimizing the combination of crops in terms of land, space, and time to enhance the utilization of arable land, light, heat, water, and fertilizer resources, as well as labor productivity. The intercropping area in the county has expanded from 50,000 mu in the past to 172,000 mu, covering over 90% of the grain fields in the plain area. The county has also carried out technical renovations on 120,000 mu of medium- and low-yield fields, achieving remarkable results.

Gaotai County has advantages in land and water resources. Based on its actual situation, the county has actively guided farmers to invest in the rational development of 30,000 mu of wasteland. Once the capital of the Northern Liang Kingdom during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Luotuocheng had long been reduced to ruins and relics due to historical wars and sandstorms. Today, after development, Luotuocheng has been transformed into a fertile oasis.

　　戈壁荒滩变绿洲
    仲秋时节，我们乘车在高台风沙线上急驰，只见连绵浓密的防护林带像一条条“绿色巨龙”伸向远方，把昔日肆虐的“黄色沙龙”遮挡得严严实实；以渠、路、林、田为骨架的林网，把一望无际的农田勾画成了片片网格；新修的农民住宅，同农电线路、古代长城融为一体，点缀在绿海碧涛之中……
    高台三面被巴丹吉林大沙漠包围，靠祁连山雪水灌溉。近10年来全县粮食持续稳步增长，出现了人进沙退、林茂粮丰、六畜兴旺、协调发展的良性循环。全县粮食平均亩产已超过550公斤，每年向国家和社会提供商品粮6000万公斤以上，商品率为58.8％。
    这个县坚持大面积地推广多类型、多品种、多形式的间作套种，让作物在土地、空间、时间上实现最佳组合，提高耕地、光热、水肥等资源的利用率和劳动生产率。全县间作套种面积已由过去的5万亩扩大到17.2万亩，占川区粮田面积的90％以上。全县还对12万亩中低产田进行技术改造，也取得了显著成果。
    高台县具有土地和水利资源优势，该县从实际出发，积极指导农民投资合理开发荒地3万亩。曾是南北朝时北凉国故都的骆驼城，由于历史上战乱频仍和风沙侵蚀，早已“颓城荒刹、遗迹犹存”；如今，经过开发，骆驼城又变成了富饶的绿洲。
