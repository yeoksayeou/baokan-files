Vice Premier Yao Yilin today pointed out at the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that, in order to stabilize the situation, based on the current economic development situation and considering the need to further advance the rectification and deepen the reform, the economic work in the coming months should focus on the following tasks:

	— Strictly control price increases. This is a major issue related to stabilizing the economy and society. If this work is done well, the carryover effect of price increases next year will be reduced, and the rate of price increases can be lowered. Reducing residents' panic over price increases will help increase bank savings, thereby reducing the amount of money in circulation. This year's price control targets must not be relaxed, and all levels of government must continue to work hard to achieve them. In the coming months, prices managed by various levels of government, including prices set by the state and state-guided prices at the county level and above, must not be raised unless specifically approved by the State Council. Prices managed by enterprises should also be strictly controlled and reported by local governments, with necessary reporting systems and public supervision. All regions and departments must continue to strengthen market and price management, focusing on stabilizing prices of vegetables and other daily necessities, daily consumer goods, and agricultural production materials. Illegal price increases or disguised price increases must be firmly cracked down on and severely punished.

	— Strive for a good harvest this year. All work related to agriculture must not be relaxed in the slightest. Mobilize and organize the broad masses of farmers to do a good job in the field management of crops, timely fertilization, weeding, irrigation, and pest control to promote crop growth and increase yield. Ensure the supply of agricultural production materials and agricultural technology guidance. Arrange necessary materials to cope with autumn floods and droughts, and continue to focus on drought relief in Northeast China and Shandong Province. Strengthen the procurement of agricultural products, and banks should flexibly allocate funds to firmly stop the diversion of agricultural product procurement funds. While striving for an agricultural harvest, increase the production and supply of daily industrial goods that are in short supply in the market, and further arrange for the people's livelihood.

	— Mobilize the masses to increase production and save resources. In the current situation of tight energy, raw materials, transportation, and funds, increasing effective supply depends on fully tapping potential and focusing on increasing production and saving resources. Increasing production cannot rely on increased input of energy, raw materials, and funds, but must focus on reducing material consumption, improving product quality, and accelerating fund turnover. Ensure stable growth of energy production, increase the production of scarce raw materials, and strengthen transportation management to improve transportation efficiency and ensure the transportation of key materials. For high-energy-consuming products and products for advanced consumption, strict production control measures must be taken. For energy, raw materials, transportation, and funds, special policies must be adopted to support and ensure the production and operation of large and medium-sized enterprises related to the national economy and people's livelihood. For enterprises with high consumption, poor quality, and no market for their products, especially township enterprises competing with large enterprises for energy and raw materials, the supply of funds and energy and raw materials must be stopped. All industries must implement the requirements of reducing consumption, improving quality, and reducing fund occupation to enterprises, and all enterprises must strengthen management, strictly adhere to technological and labor disciplines, and truly improve economic efficiency.

	— Mobilize the masses to increase revenue and reduce expenditures. In the current situation of severe financial difficulties, without the spirit of hard work and efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, it will be difficult to get by. And we have great potential in increasing revenue and reducing expenditures. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have required us to tighten our belts for a few years, but now our lives are not tight, and many aspects are still spending money recklessly. To control inflation and overcome financial difficulties, we must take effective measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditures. First, we must strengthen tax management and collect all taxes that should be collected, especially strengthening the taxation of collective, individual, and private economies in accordance with the law, while protecting their legal income. We must quickly establish a system for the declaration of individual taxable income and strictly collect personal income tax. Various tax evasion behaviors must be severely punished in accordance with the law. Second, we must reduce various expenditures, especially reduce the administrative management fees of administrative organs and enterprises and institutions, and further reduce social purchasing power. We must carry out a nationwide campaign against waste. Institutions that can be abolished or merged must be resolutely abolished and merged. Third, we must take effective measures to control the rapid growth of personal consumption demand and firmly stop enterprises and institutions from issuing bonuses, subsidies, and goods indiscriminately. We must explain to the people that controlling inflation requires the whole country to tighten its belt for a period of time.

	— Continue to reduce the scale of investment and strengthen key construction. All regions and departments must strictly follow the relevant regulations of the State Council, continue to clean up ongoing projects, and all project investments must be included in the national control of the investment scale "cage." Except for a few projects that have been approved for adjustment, all projects that cannot be included in the "cage" must be resolutely stopped. Strictly control new projects, and prevent the phenomenon of splitting projects and approving projects beyond authority. Those who engage in deception and falsification during the cleaning of projects and the reduction of investment scale must be seriously investigated and dealt with. While reducing the scale of investment, appropriate measures must be taken to ensure necessary key construction to avoid a decline in production next year.

	— Strive to increase savings deposits and reduce money supply. Continue to tighten credit, follow the principle of ensuring key areas and reducing general areas, further improve the loan structure, and control the scale of loans. Continue to improve the service work of banks, strengthen the propaganda of patriotic savings, and increase residents' savings deposits. Carry out a comprehensive inventory reduction to reduce unreasonable fund occupation. Further strengthen cash management, carry out a comprehensive inspection of credit funds, actively clean up various overdue accounts, and quickly reverse the phenomenon of funds "circulating outside the system." Under the premise of adhering to the "double-tight" policy, banks should appropriately allocate some funds to support key construction, foreign trade procurement funds, and initial funds for new production projects, as well as funds for clearing "triangular debts."

	— Strive to do a good job in all aspects of opening up to the outside world. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee clearly pointed out that reform and opening up is our path to national strength. We will unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the outside world and continue to focus on the following work: vigorously increase exports and increase foreign exchange earnings. Effectively solve the problem of procurement funds for key areas and key products that are urgently needed for export; mobilize relevant parties to squeeze out some goods for export; and continue to develop "three-in-one" in places with conditions. Improve the import and export structure, promote "import substitution," accelerate the process of localization, and truly use limited foreign exchange on goods that must be imported. Make good use of foreign funds. Actively seek long-term, low-interest loans from foreign governments and international financial organizations. All regions and departments must continue to improve the investment environment, attract more foreign direct investment, and focus on managing a number of existing Sino-foreign joint ventures to expand influence. The policies of the special economic zones will not change, and the special economic zones will continue to be developed to enhance the attraction of foreign investment.

	— Continue to deepen the reform. According to the various requirements for deepening the reform proposed by Premier Li Peng in this year's government work report, on the basis of carefully summarizing experience, focus on the reform work in several aspects. Continue to improve and develop the enterprise contract responsibility system, especially to increase the vitality of large and medium-sized enterprises in every possible way and create better equal competition conditions for them. At the same time, continue to promote cross-regional and cross-departmental horizontal economic cooperation, develop enterprise groups, and promote the rational allocation of resources. Effectively clean up and rectify various companies, resolutely abolish companies that engage in speculation and make huge profits, and those that are not necessary, and severely crack down on and eliminate various illegal business activities to improve market order, and promptly publicize the results of the cleanup and rectification of companies. Further strengthen the construction of clean government, rectify financial discipline, and combat corruption. Strengthen and improve the state's macro-control. Strengthen the coordination work of comprehensive economic departments in finance, banking, taxation, and other aspects to ensure that various economic means play a coordinated role. At the same time, play the necessary role of administrative means. Strengthen economic legislation and gradually standardize various economic behaviors through legal means. Quickly study measures to increase the proportion of financial, material, and foreign exchange resources controlled by the central government to enhance the central government's macro-control capabilities.

    姚依林在人大常委会会议上提出
    当前经济工作着重抓八件事
    新华社北京8月31日电　国务院副总理姚依林今天在全国人大常委会上指出，为了稳定大局，根据当前经济发展情况，考虑到进一步推进治理整顿和深化改革的要求，今年后几个月的经济工作要着重抓好以下几件事：
    ——严格控制物价上涨。这是关系稳定经济、安定社会的大事。这项工作做好了，明年物价翘尾巴的部分就会减少，物价上涨幅度就可以多降一点。居民对物价上涨的恐慌心理减小，有利于增加银行储蓄，从而减少货币投放量。今年控制物价的要求不能松口，各级政府要按原定目标继续努力做工作。今后几个月，各级政府管理的价格，包括县和县以上管理的国家定价和国家指导价，除经国务院特批之外，一律不得出台提价的措施；属于企业自行管理的价格，当地政府也要严格把关和实行必要的申报制度，并发动群众加以监督。各地区、各部门都要继续加强市场管理和物价管理，重点把蔬菜等副食品、日用品的价格和农业生产资料的价格稳住。对于乱涨价或变相涨价的行为，要坚决打击和严厉制裁。
    ——争取全年农业生产有个好收成。加强农业的各项工作都不能有丝毫松懈。要动员和组织广大农民，搞好农作物的田间管理，及时追肥、除草、灌溉和防治病虫害，促进作物生长，增加产量。要搞好农业生产资料的供应和农业技术指导。安排必要的物资，以适应抵御秋涝秋旱等灾害的需要，目前东北、山东等地区要继续抓紧做好抗旱工作。加强农产品的收购工作，银行要灵活调配资金，坚决制止挪用农产品收购资金的现象。在夺取农业丰收的同时，要大力增加市场短缺的日用工业品的生产和供应，进一步安排好人民生活。
    ——发动群众大搞增产节约。在当前能源、原材料、运力和资金紧张的情况下，要增加有效供给，关键是要充分挖掘潜力，狠抓增产节约。要增加生产，不能把希望寄托在增加能源、原材料和资金的投入上，而必须从降低物质消耗、提高产品质量、加速资金周转上下功夫。要保证能源生产的稳定增长，大力增产短缺原材料，并加强运输管理，提高运输效率，保证重点物资的运输。对高耗能的产品和超前消费的产品，要采取严格的限产措施。要在能源、原材料、运力和资金供应上，采取一些特殊的政策措施，支持和保证那些关系国计民生的大中型企业的生产和经营。对那些消耗高、质量差、产品无销路的企业，特别是与大企业争能源、原材料的乡镇企业，要下决心停止供应资金和能源、原材料。各行各业都要把降低消耗、提高质量和减少资金占用的要求落实到企业，所有企业都要加强管理，严格工艺纪律和劳动纪律，切实提高经济效益。
    ——发动群众大搞增收节支。在当前财政面临严重困难的情况下，不发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，不努力增收节支，日子是过不去的。而我们在增收节支方面确有很大潜力。党中央、国务院要求过几年紧日子，但现在的日子并不紧，许多方面还在大手大脚地花钱。要治理通货膨胀，渡过财政难关，必须采取有力的措施，增收节支。一是要下决心强化税收管理，把应该收的税统统收上来，特别是要加强对集体、个体经营者和私营经济依法征税，同时保护他们的合法收入。要尽快建立个人应税收入的申报制度，严格征收个人所得税。对各种偷税漏税行为，要依法严厉惩处。二是下决心压缩各项开支，特别要紧缩行政机关和企事业单位的行政管理费开支，进一步压缩社会集团购买力。要在全国范围内扎扎实实地开展反对铺张浪费的运动。一些可有可无的机构要坚决撤销和合并。三是采取切实有效的办法，控制个人消费需求的过快增长，坚决制止企事业单位滥发奖金、补贴和实物。要向群众讲清楚，治理通货膨胀，全国非得过一段紧日子不可。
    ——继续压缩投资规模，加强重点建设。各地区、各部门都要严格按照国务院有关规定，继续清理在建项目，所有项目的投资都必须纳入国家下达的控制投资规模的“笼子”。除了个别经过批准可进行调整的以外，所有纳不进“笼子”的，要坚决把项目砍下来。严格控制新开工项目，杜绝化整为零和越权审批项目的现象。在清理项目和压缩投资规模中阳奉阴违、弄虚作假的，要严肃查处。在压缩投资规模的同时，要采取适当的措施保必要的重点建设，以避免明年的生产出现滑坡。
    ——狠抓增加储蓄存款，减少货币投放。要继续抽紧银根，按照保证重点、压缩一般的原则，进一步改善贷款结构，控制贷款规模。要继续改进银行的服务工作，加强爱国储蓄的宣传，以增加居民储蓄存款。普遍开展清仓利库，减少不合理的资金占用。进一步加强现金管理，开展信贷资金大检查，积极清理各种拖欠款项，尽快扭转资金“体外循环”现象。在坚持“双紧”方针的前提下，银行要适当拿出一部分钱，支持重点建设、外贸收购资金和新投产项目的铺底资金，以及用于清理“三角债”的启动资金。
    ——努力抓好对外开放的各项工作。党的十三届四中全会明确指出，改革开放是我们的强国之路。我们坚定不移地实行对外开放，要继续抓紧抓好以下工作：大力增加出口，增加外汇收入。切实解决重点地区、重点产品急需的出口商品收购资金；动员有关方面再挤一部分商品出口；有条件的地方，要继续发展“三来一补”。要改善进出口结构，搞好“进口替代”，加速国产化进程，把有限的外汇真正用在必须进口的商品上。用好国外资金。对能够争取到的长期低息的外国政府贷款和国际金融组织贷款，要积极争取。各地区、各部门要继续改善投资环境，多吸引外商直接投资，并下力量办好一批已建的中外合资企业，以扩大影响。经济特区的政策不变，继续把特区办好，以增强对外资的吸引力。
    ——继续深化改革。要按照李鹏总理在今年政府工作报告中提出的关于深化改革的各项要求，在认真总结经验的基础上，着重抓好几个方面的改革工作。继续完善和发展企业经营承包责任制，特别是千方百计增强大中型企业的活力，为它们创造更好的平等竞争条件。同时，继续推进跨地区、跨部门的横向经济联合，发展企业集团，促进资源合理配置。切实搞好各种公司的清理和整顿，坚决撤销那些专事倒买倒卖、从中牟取暴利的公司和那些可有可无的公司，严厉打击和取缔各种违法经营，改善市场秩序，并将清理整顿公司的结果及时公布于众。要进一步抓好廉政建设，整饬财经纪律，惩治腐败现象。加强和改善国家的宏观调控。要加强综合经济部门对财政、金融、税务等方面的协调工作，保证各种经济手段配套发挥作用。同时，要发挥必要的行政手段的作用。要加强经济立法，运用法律手段来逐步规范各种经济行为。要抓紧研究提高中央掌握的财力、物力和外汇比重的措施，以增强中央宏观调控能力。
