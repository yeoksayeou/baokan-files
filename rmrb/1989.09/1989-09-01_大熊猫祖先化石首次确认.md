    The first confirmation of giant panda ancestor fossil
    Our reporter informs that two researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have recently re-examined fossil specimens that were identified as ancestral bears about a decade ago. They confirmed that these specimens are indeed the ancestors of the giant panda, for which they have formally named them as Lufeng Primitive Panda.

    For over a century, scientists have been debating whether the giant panda should be classified under the bear family, the raccoon family, or stand alone as a separate family. The reason for this debate is the lack of understanding of the morphological characteristics of the panda's ancestors. The specimens identified this time consist of 14 teeth, discovered in the fossil site of ancient apes in Lufeng County, Yunnan Province, dating back to the late Middle Miocene. This discovery has dispelled the mysteries surrounding the origin, evolution, and classification of giant pandas.

    大熊猫祖先化石首次确认
    本报讯　中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所的两位研究人员，最近在重新研究了10来年前被鉴定为祖熊的化石标本之后，确认这些标本正是我们长期梦寐以求的大熊猫类动物的祖先，他们为之正式订名为禄丰始猫熊。
    100多年来，科学家们对于大熊猫应归熊科、还是浣熊料，或者应该独自为一科的问题，一直争论不休。原因是对熊猫类的祖先的形态特征缺乏认识。这次科研人员鉴定的标本是14颗牙齿，产于云南省禄丰县古猿化石产地，时代是晚中新世。这一发现驱散了笼罩在大熊猫类动物的起源、进化和分类等问题上的迷雾。　（张法奎）
