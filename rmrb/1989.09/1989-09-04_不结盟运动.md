    The Non-Aligned Movement
    In 1956, Yugoslav President Tito, Egyptian President Nasser, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru first proposed the idea of non-alignment. In September 1961, Yugoslavia, India, Egypt, Indonesia, and Afghanistan jointly initiated the first summit of non-aligned countries in Belgrade. Since then, the Non-Aligned Movement has emerged as an independent political force on the international stage. Over 28 years, the movement has continued to grow, playing an increasingly significant role in international affairs. Its membership has expanded from 25 to 102 countries, making up nearly two-thirds of the world's nations.
    The Non-Aligned Movement adheres to the principles of independence, autonomy, and non-alignment with major powers or blocs, based on peaceful coexistence. It supports the struggles of all peoples for national independence and against aggression and interference by major powers, and advocates for the resolution of economic issues and economic inequality.
    The Summit of Non-Aligned Countries is the highest decision-making body of the Non-Aligned Movement, convening every three years. Prior to this, eight such summits have been held.
    The first summit was held from September 1 to 6, 1961, in Belgrade, with 25 countries in attendance. The summit adopted the "Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries" and the "Statement on the Dangers of War and the Appeal for Peace," among other documents.
    The second summit was held from October 5 to 10, 1964, in Cairo, with 47 countries participating. The summit adopted the "Program for Peace and International Cooperation," among other documents.
    The third summit was held from September 8 to 10, 1970, in Lusaka, with 54 countries in attendance. The summit adopted the "Lusaka Declaration on Peace, Independence, Development, Cooperation, and Democratization of International Relations," among other documents.
    The fourth summit was held from September 5 to 9, 1973, in Algiers, with 75 countries participating. The summit adopted the "Political Declaration," "Economic Declaration," and decided to establish a Coordinating Bureau.
    The fifth summit was held from August 16 to 19, 1976, in Colombo, with 86 countries and organizations in attendance. The summit adopted the "Political Declaration," "Economic Declaration," among other documents.
    The sixth summit was held from September 3 to 9, 1979, in Havana, with 95 member countries and organizations participating. The summit adopted the "Declaration of the Summit of Non-Aligned Countries," among other documents.
    The seventh summit was held from March 7 to 12, 1983, in New Delhi, with 101 countries and organizations in attendance. The summit adopted the "Political Declaration," "Economic Declaration," among other documents.
    The eighth summit was held from September 1 to 7, 1986, in Harare, with 100 countries participating. The summit adopted the "Political Declaration," "Economic Declaration," the "Special Declaration on Southern Africa," and the "Harare Appeal for Disarmament," among other documents.
