Today, hundreds of representatives from the national petroleum front and over 5,000 Daqing residents joyfully celebrated the 30th anniversary of the discovery of the Daqing Oilfield. Daqing also brought good news: by 5 PM today, Daqing had produced a cumulative total of 1 billion tons of crude oil for the country, exceeding half of the nation's cumulative crude oil production; it had remitted 77.9 billion yuan to the state treasury, equivalent to 11.8 times the total investment by the state during the same period; and it had exported over 200 million tons of crude oil, earning 2.8 billion US dollars in foreign exchange.

The State Council sent a congratulatory telegram on September 25, expressing warm congratulations and sincere greetings to the cadres, engineering and technical personnel, workers, and families of the Daqing Oilfield.

On September 26, 1959, the Songji 3 well in the northern part of the Songliao Basin gushed oil, marking the birth of the Daqing Oilfield. The subsequent arduous and magnificent Daqing campaign declared the bankruptcy of the "China is poor in oil" theory and the end of China's nearly 100-year reliance on "foreign oil."

At today's celebration, Wang Tao, General Manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation, proposed that the following five aspects should be learned from Daqing: learning Daqing's patriotism of putting the overall situation first and making more contributions, and insisting on the spirit of self-reliance and hard work; learning Daqing's reliance on the working class, and insisting on the mass line in enterprise management; learning Daqing's principle of combining revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, and continuously promoting scientific and technological progress; learning Daqing's experience in strengthening ideological and political work, and insisting on cultivating and building a workforce that meets the "four-haves" requirements with the spirit of the "Iron Man"; learning Daqing's experience in strengthening party building, and insisting on the party's political leadership over enterprises.

Kang Shien, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and the commander-in-chief of the Daqing campaign at that time, as well as some old leaders from the former Ministry of Petroleum, old model workers, and experts from the Daqing campaign period attended today's meeting. Kang Shien, as an "old petroleum soldier," recalled with deep emotion the affectionate care and meticulous cultivation of the Daqing Oilfield by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping, and commemorated the comrades who dedicated themselves to the development and construction of the Daqing Oilfield, such as the "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi. He also conveyed the congratulations and greetings from Yu Qiuyi, the main leader of the Daqing campaign at that time.

Kang Shien said that the most outstanding and fundamental aspect of Daqing that has not changed is that the party's fine traditions have not changed; the insistence on the four cardinal principles has not changed; the spirit of hard work and enthusiasm during the campaign has not changed; and the "three olds and four stricts" style has not changed.

At today's celebration, 100 advanced red-flag units, including the 2012 drilling team (the original 1205 drilling team led by the "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi in his lifetime), and 60 labor model exemplars, such as Shen Guan, who have made outstanding contributions to the development of Daqing in the new era of reform and opening up, were commended.

Sun Weiben, Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, delivered a speech. Lieutenant General Li Wenqing, Deputy Political Commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, read the congratulatory message from the Shenyang Military Region. The Ministry of Energy, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and other units sent congratulatory telegrams, messages, and words of congratulation, and presented banners.

    本报大庆9月27日电　记者高新庆、张何平报道：今天，当来自全国石油战线的几百名代表和5000多名大庆人喜气洋洋庆祝大庆油田发现30周年时，大庆又传喜讯：至今天17时，大庆为国家生产原油累计达到了10亿吨，超过全国累计生产原油总量的一半；累计上缴国家财政779亿元，相当于国家同期投资总额的11.8倍；累计出口原油2亿多吨，为国家创汇280多亿美元。
    国务院9月25日发来贺电，特向大庆油田的干部、工程技术人员、工人和家属，表示热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。
    1959年9月26日，松辽盆地北部松基3号井喜喷油流，标志着大庆油田的诞生。随后进行的艰苦卓绝、气壮山河的大庆会战，宣告了“中国贫油”论的破产和近百年中国使用“洋油”时代的结束。
    中国石油天然气总公司王涛总经理在今天的庆祝大会上提出，要从以下五个方面来开展学习：学习大庆顾全大局、多作贡献的爱国主义思想，坚持发扬自力更生、艰苦创业精神；学习大庆全心全意依靠工人阶级，坚持企业管理工作中的群众路线；学习大庆坚持革命精神同科学态度相结合的原则，不断推进科学技术进步；学习大庆加强思想政治工作的经验，坚持用“铁人”精神培育和建设符合“四有”要求的职工队伍；学习大庆加强党的建设的经验，坚持党对企业的政治领导。
    中顾委常委、当年大庆会战的总指挥康世恩以及原石油部的一些老领导、大庆会战时期的老标兵、老专家出席了今天的大会。康世恩以“石油老兵”的身份，深情回忆毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德、邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家对大庆油田的亲切关怀和精心培育，缅怀“铁人”王进喜等为大庆油田开发建设和发展献身的同志所建立的功勋，并转达了当年大庆会战的主要领导者余秋里的祝贺和问候。
    康世恩说，大庆最突出的，也是最根本的一条没有变，这就是党的优良传统没有变；坚持四项基本原则没有变；会战时的艰苦创业精神和干劲没有变；“三老四严”的作风没有变。
    今天的庆祝大会上，在改革开放新时期为发展大庆作出突出贡献的2012钻井队（“铁人”王进喜生前率领的原1205钻井队）等100个先进红旗单位和申冠等60名劳动模范标兵受到表彰。
    中共黑龙江省委书记、省人大主任孙维本讲了话。沈阳军区副政委李文清中将宣读了沈阳军区的贺信。能源部、全国总工会、团中央、全国妇联等单位发来贺电、贺信和贺词，并赠送了锦旗。
