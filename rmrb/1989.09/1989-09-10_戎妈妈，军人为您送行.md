Title: Soldiers Bid Farewell to Stepmother of the Troops

Stepmother of the Troops, these days, all the soldiers in the army have been deeply saddened by your loss. Marshal Nie Rongzhen, who is recuperating in Beidaihe, was the first to send a telegram of condolence. Wasn't it Marshal Nie who personally presented you with a banner embroidered with "Stepmother of the Troops" on February 19, 1944? From that day on, your name became a banner inspiring millions of people and their children in the army.

That day, hundreds of soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police, along with officials and the masses from your hometown, came to see you off. Among them, many had sat on your warm kang, eaten your walnuts and red dates, and listened to your stories. There were old soldiers you could call by name; there were also new recruits who had never seen your face or heard your voice.

Stepmother of the Troops, you recognize him—standing beside you for a long time is that old general—National Hero Song Shuang! Last year, before August 1st, he brought a pot of blooming plum blossoms to the hospital to visit you, wishing you a recovery like a tree blooming in spring. You and he agreed that this autumn, when the walnuts and red dates are ripe, you would use a donkey to bring him to your home to stay for a few days, to chat about the days when the military and civilians fought together against the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek, and to ask Old Song for advice on changing the poverty-stricken face of the Taihang Mountains.

The combat hero Wei Laiguo, whom you met at the National Model Conference in 1950, unfortunately could not come to see you off due to circumstances beyond his control. He and his wife felt deeply regretful. That day, he held a photo taken during the Spring Festival of 1984 when he visited your home, and you embraced each other like mother and son. At that conference, you were both members of the Presidium, sitting together with the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, encouraging each other with Chairman Mao's words at the conference, determined to be "the backbone pushing various aspects of the people's cause forward, the reliable pillars of the people's government, and the bridges connecting the people's government with the broad masses." Decades of practice have proven that you did not disappoint the Party's expectations.

You often mentioned the "two old Hus"—the dramatist Hu Ke and the film artist Hu Peng. These days, their hearts have been unsettled, and memories of past events have been flooding back. After you were honored as a patriotic and supportive model by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, it was they who first brought your story to the stage. The play "Jiong Guanxiu" starring "Old Lady Hu" caused a strong reaction among the border region's military and civilians, and soon the region saw moving scenes of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers competing to go to the battlefield. You never considered yourself a model, and for decades, you worked hard as if it were just one day. "Old Lady Hu" recounted to me a memorable small incident with tears in her eyes: During the Third National People's Congress, the "two old Hus" invited you to Donglaishun for a hot pot. They also invited Wei Wei to join. You pointed at the several plates of mutton and small dishes on the table and said, "This must cost a lot of money, ordinary people can't afford such good things!" You instructed everyone to use steamed buns to wipe clean the dishes, saying, "It would be such a waste to throw it away!" The gray gabardine suit given to you by higher-ups, you only wore it when you went to Beijing for meetings, usually wearing patched old clothes. You said, "As a people's representative, you must not detach yourself from the masses. Most people are still not rich, and the country still has many difficulties!" "Old Lady Hu" is 20 years younger than you, and she always regarded you as a loving mother and a good teacher. She was able to successfully create many artistic images of revolutionary mothers, drawing rich spiritual nourishment from you and many mothers like you.

During your stay at the White Seekers International Peace Hospital, you often praised the white-clad warriors, saying they were all like Norman Bethune. But they said, "It is the Norman Bethune spirit in Stepmother Jiong that inspires and educates us. We should thank Stepmother Jiong!" That day, when you learned that a counter-revolutionary riot had occurred in Beijing, some soldiers were beaten and burned, you suddenly opened your eyes wide and shouted in a half-comatose state, "Who dares to beat my soldiers, I'll fight to the death with them! Those bastards, they really deserve it, they really deserve it!" Everyone quickly told you that the counter-revolutionary riot had been suppressed, and you calmed down. Your love and hatred are so clear!

You were hardworking and thrifty all your life. Even on your sickbed, you sewed several cushions for your grandchildren using scraps of cloth, leaving them as your legacy. You also prepared a patched funeral robe for yourself, fearing that your children would spend too much money on your funeral.

Stepmother of the Troops, soldiers are bidding you farewell. Your ashes will be placed in the Martyrs' Cemetery of North China. Surrounding you are revolutionaries who shed their blood for our republic. In life, you toiled for the soldiers; in death, you rest among them. You must feel content, right?

　　戎妈妈，军人为您送行
　　新华社记者　赵苏
    戎妈妈，这些天来，全军官兵都为失去您而沉浸在深深的悲痛之中。正在北戴河疗养的聂荣臻元帅最先发唁电哀悼您。1944年2月19日，不正是聂帅亲手把绣着“子弟兵的母亲”的锦旗授予您的吗？从那时起，您的名字便成为鼓舞千千万万人民及其子弟兵的一面旗帜。
    那天，几百名解放军和武警部队官兵同您家乡的干部群众一起为您送行，他们中有不少人坐过您的热炕头，吃过您的核桃、红枣，听过您的故事。有您能叫出名字的老战士；也有从未见过您的面容、听过您的声音的新兵。
    戎妈妈，您认识他——在您身边肃立良久的那位老将军——全国战斗英雄宋双！去年“八一”前夕，他捧着一盆盛开的梅花盆景到医院看您，祝愿您病树逢春。您和他约好，今秋核桃、红枣熟了的时候，用毛驴接他到家里多住几日，好好拉拉当年军民同心打鬼子、打老蒋的事，还要请老宋为改变太行山区的贫困面貌出主意。
    您在1950年全国英模会上结识的战斗英雄魏来国，因故未能前来为您送行，他和老伴感到极大的遗憾。那天，他拿着1984年春节去家里看您时，你们母子重逢般拥抱在一起的那张合影，他的眼睛湿润了。在那次群英会上，你们同为大会主席团成员，和毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等老一辈无产阶级革命家坐在一起开会，互相用毛主席在大会上的祝词相勉励，决心做“推动各方面人民事业胜利前进的骨干，做人民政府的可靠支柱和人民政府联系广大群众的桥梁”。几十年的实践证明，你们没有辜负党的期望。
    您常念叨的“两个老胡”——戏剧家胡可、电影艺术家胡朋，这几天心情一直难以平静，往事件件涌上心头。您被晋察冀边区政府树立为爱国拥军模范后，是他们夫妇俩首先把您的事迹搬上舞台的，“女老胡”主演的话剧《戎冠秀》在边区军民中引起了强烈反响，边区很快出现了母送子、妻送郎、兄弟相争上战场的动人情景。您从不以功臣自居，几十年艰苦奋斗如一日。“女老胡”眼含热泪向我讲述了她难忘的一件小事：你们一起出席第三届全国人大会议期间，“两个老胡”请您到东来顺吃涮羊肉，还拉了魏巍作陪。您指着桌子上的几盘羊肉、几盘小菜连说：“这得花多少钱哪，老百姓可吃不上这么好的东西！”您让大家用烧饼把盘子里的菜汤全擦干净，说：“倒掉了多可惜呀！”上级发给您的那套灰卡叽制服，您只有进京开会时才舍得穿，平时总是穿着打着补钉的旧衣服，您说：“当了人民代表，就更不能脱离群众，多数群众还不富裕，国家还有很多困难啊！”“女老胡”小您整整20岁，她始终把您当作慈母良师，她能成功地塑造出一个个革命母亲的艺术形象，就是从您和众多的像您一样的母亲身上吸取了丰富的精神营养。
    您在白求恩国际和平医院住院期间，您常夸白衣战士个个像白求恩。可他们说：“正是戎妈妈身上的白求恩精神鼓舞教育了我们，我们要感谢戎妈妈哩！”那天，得知北京发生了反革命暴乱，一些战士被打被烧，处于半昏迷状态的您，突然睁大眼睛大声喊起来：“谁敢打俺的战士，俺跟他拚了！这些坏蛋，真该死呀，真该死！”大家连忙告诉您，反革命暴乱已经平息，您才安静下来，您的爱憎多么分明啊！
    您一生勤劳节俭，在病榻上还用碎布头为儿孙们缝了十几个坐垫，这就是您留给他们的遗产。您还为自己准备了一件打着补钉的寿衣，深怕儿女为您的后事多花钱。
    戎妈妈，军人为您送行。您的骨灰将安放在华北烈士陵园，您周围都是为我们共和国流血牺牲的革命烈士，您生前为子弟兵操劳，死后又安息在他们中间，一定感到欣慰吧？
