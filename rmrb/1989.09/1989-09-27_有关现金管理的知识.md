Cash management is a major component of the monetary system and a crucial financial regulation of the state. Banks and credit unions, in accordance with China's cash management regulations, conduct cash management.

All cash held by various units must have a storage limit determined. Any amount exceeding this limit must be deposited with a bank or credit union on the same day and may not be retained by the unit. Public funds stored must not be held under private names. Each unit must establish cash accounts and may not use "white slips" to replace stored cash. Cash may not be borrowed between individuals or units. It is forbidden to falsify purposes to withdraw cash or to exchange cash using transfer vouchers. Bank accounts may not be used to deposit or withdraw cash on behalf of others. Economic transactions between units must be settled through bank transfers. Cash payments made by various units, except for minor expenses that can be paid from the unit's stored cash, must not be paid directly from the unit's cash income (unless otherwise stipulated by the state).

Penalties for violating cash management regulations include: criticism and education; suspension of partial or all cash payments for a certain period (excluding planned wages); and for business personnel who violate regulations by carrying large amounts of cash, their cash will be frozen by the bank.

    有关现金管理的知识
    现金管理是货币制度的一项主要内容，也是国家重要的财经制度。银行和信用社依照我国现金管理法规，进行现金管理。
    各单位所有现金，要核定库存限额，库存以外的部分要当天存送银行或信用社，不得自行保留。储存的公款，不准用私人名义。各单位必须建立现金帐目，不准用“白条”顶替库存现金，不准私人或单位之间借用现金。不准伪造用途套取现金或用转帐凭证套换现金。不准用银行帐户代他人存入或支出现金。单位之间的经济往来，必须通过银行转帐结算。各单位支付的现金，除零星开支可从单位库存现金中支付外，其它一切支出不准从本单位收入的现金中直接支付（国家另有规定除外）。
    对违反现金管理法规的制裁有：批评教育；在一定期间内停止部分和全部现金支付
  （不包括计划内的工资）；对业务人员违反规定携带大量现金的，令其到银行予以冻结等。　方　初
