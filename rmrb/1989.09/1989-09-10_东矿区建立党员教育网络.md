The Communist Party of China's Tangshan City Dong Mining District Committee prioritizes the Party's ideological construction, establishing a party member education network to strengthen the ideological education of party members.

Dong Mining District has a total of 10,236 party members, making the task of party member education quite heavy. In 1986, the district built 19 party schools on the basis of the original district committee party school, in each township, street, and bureau party committee. In 1987, "Party Member Homes" and "Party Member Service Teams" were established in urban neighborhood committee party branches and rural village party branches.

Since September 1986, the district committee party school alone has held 15 training sessions for county-level and above party cadre rotation classes, with a total of 2,100 cadres systematically studying Marxist philosophy, political economy, scientific socialism, and the basic knowledge of party building, professional management, and legal knowledge. Due to the establishment of a crisscrossing party member education network, it is possible to implement tiered education according to the individual situation of party members and the actual work, thereby improving the political, ideological quality and theoretical, policy level of party cadres to varying degrees.

　　东矿区建立党员教育网络
    中共唐山市东矿区委把党的思想建设放在首位，建立党员教育网络，加强对党员的思想教育工作。
    东矿区共有10236名党员，党员教育任务相当繁重。1986年，全区在原有区委党校的基础上，各乡、街、局党委又建起了19所党校。1987年又在城市居委会党支部、农村村党支部建立了“党员之家”和“党员服务组”。
    1986年9月以来，仅区委党校就举办科以上党员干部轮训班15期，先后有2100名干部比较系统地学习《马克思主义哲学》、《政治经济学》、《科学社会主义》和党的建设基础知识、专业管理和法律知识。由于建立了纵横交错的党员教育网络，能够根据党员本人情况和工作实际实行分层次教育，党员干部的政治、思想素质和理论、政策水平有了不同程度的提高。
