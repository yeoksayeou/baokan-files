As an ethnic minority education worker, I have visited many ethnic minority regions and observed many ethnic minority schools. What I have seen and heard has made me truly feel that since the founding of the nation, China's ethnic minority education has achieved tremendous progress, and the backward state of ethnic minority culture and education has greatly improved.

In terms of scale and development speed, the education industry in ethnic minority regions has indeed undergone a dramatic transformation. In 1988, the number of ethnic minority students in national ordinary higher education institutions, secondary schools, and primary schools were 59.3, 71, and 10.4 times the numbers in 1951, respectively. Currently, a preliminary ethnic minority education system has been established, with ethnic minority higher education institutions in provinces and autonomous regions, ethnic minority secondary schools in ethnic minority counties, and ethnic minority primary schools in ethnic minority townships and some villages. Even for the Jino people, who were still in the primitive state of recording events by carving wood and tying knots before liberation, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 99.3%, and there are 24 college students per 10,000 people, exceeding the national average.

It is worth mentioning that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the internal structure of ethnic minority education has been adjusted, and the situation where it was not in line with the needs of economic and cultural development in ethnic minority regions has been initially changed.

Ethnic minority basic education has been strengthened. The number of primary school students per 10,000 people in some ethnic minority regions has exceeded the national average. More and more ethnic minority people have come to understand the importance of early intelligence development. In the past, ethnic minority preschool education was extremely backward. Now, there are 482,000 ethnic minority children in kindergartens nationwide.

In ethnic minority secondary education, the achievements of teacher training are particularly notable. In recent years, the state has adopted measures such as establishing ethnic minority teacher training centers, setting up ethnic minority normal schools and ethnic minority normal classes to strengthen the training of ethnic minority teachers, which has improved the severe shortage of ethnic minority teachers. In the past, ethnic minority secondary education was basically about promoting students to higher education, and education was disconnected from local economic needs. As a result, although education developed rapidly, the landscape did not change. It is gratifying to see that in recent years, people have realized that ethnic minority regions lack mid-level technical talents and skilled workers the most, and vigorously developing vocational and technical education in ethnic minority regions has become a consensus. In 1988, the number of students enrolled in vocational and technical secondary schools in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture accounted for 39% of the total enrollment in the senior high school stage. They have set up courses in clothing, ethnic handicrafts, planting, and breeding based on local economic characteristics. Graduates from these courses will play a role in developing rural economies, helping the masses to get rich, and promoting the modernization of ethnic minority regions.

Before liberation, there were almost no universities in ethnic minority regions in China. Now, there are 101 ordinary higher education institutions in national autonomous regions, with more than 130,000 university students, including local Han students. The ability of ethnic minority regions to cultivate local talents has greatly improved, easing the demand for local talents. In the past, ethnic minority high-level specialized talents were rare. Now, the majority of the 55 ethnic minorities have a certain number of college students, and some even have master's and doctoral students.

Many ethnic minority university graduates have made outstanding contributions in production, scientific research, and other fields. In 1984, Mongolian scholar Xūrìgàn, who obtained a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Japan, successfully experimented with the world's first test-tube goat. Gélè, the first Tibetan doctoral student cultivated in China, wrote the first academic work on the history of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, among the ethnic minority leaders at the county level and above, there are more than 700 graduates from the Central Institute for Nationalities.

In the development of education, the excellent traditional culture of ethnic minorities is respected. In ethnic minority schools, propagating the Party's ethnic policies and safeguarding national unity have become indispensable educational content. In ordinary primary and secondary schools, respecting the wishes of ethnic minorities, widely adopting ethnic language teaching or bilingual teaching. During the enrollment of senior high schools and professional schools, it is allowed to answer questions in ethnic minority scripts. The state helps to compile ethnic minority language textbooks. In universities, more than 20 ethnic minority language and literature majors have been set up, and majors such as ethnology and ethnic history have also been set up to cultivate specialized personnel for inheriting and studying ethnic minority cultures.

With the opening up to the outside world, various ethnic groups have more opportunities to interact and learn from each other. More and more ethnic minority people have come to realize the importance of learning Mandarin and foreign languages. Xiangxi Prefecture has carried out the experiment of "Pinyin speaking, phonetic reading, and early reading," enabling first-grade ethnic minority students to recognize an average of 1,400 characters, solving the problem of students learning Mandarin.

Looking back on the 40-year journey, New China has brought about great achievements in ethnic minority education.

　　喜看今日民族教育
　　王铁志（蒙古族）
    作为民族教育工作者，我到过许多少数民族地方，参观过许多民族学校。耳闻目睹，使我切实感到，建国以来，我国少数民族教育事业取得了巨大成就，少数民族文化教育落后的面貌有了很大改变。
    从规模和发展速度来看，少数民族地区的教育事业的确发生了翻天覆地的变化。一九八八年全国普通高等学校、中等学校、小学校各有少数民族在校生分别是一九五一年的五十九点三、七十一和十点四倍。目前已初步形成了省、自治区有民族高等院校，民族县有民族中学，民族乡和部分村有民族小学，牧区和边远山区有寄宿制学校的民族教育体系。仅就解放前还处于刻木结绳记事的原始状态的基诺族来说，现在学龄儿童入学率达百分之九十九点三，每万人中有大学生二十四人，超过了全国平均水平。
    值得一提的是，党的十一届三中全会以来，民族教育内部结构得到调整，初步改变了与民族地区经济、文化发展需要不相适应的状况。
    少数民族基础教育得到加强。一些少数民族地区每万人中的小学生数已超过全国平均水平。越来越多的少数民族群众认识到了早期智力开发的重要性。过去少数民族幼儿教育极其落后，如今全国幼儿园中少数民族幼儿已达四十八点二万人。
    在少数民族中等教育中，师范教育所取得的成就极为显著。近年来由于国家采取了建立少数民族师资培训中心，办民族师范学校和民族师范班等办法加强培养少数民族师资，使少数民族师资奇缺的状况得到改善。过去，少数民族中学教育基本是升学教育，教育与当地经济需要脱节，结果虽然教育大发展，山河却未改观。可喜的是，近几年人们已认识到，民族地区最缺的是中初级技术人才和能工巧匠，大力发展民族地区的职业技术教育已成为多数人的共识。湖南湘西自治州一九八八年中等职业技术学校招生人数占高中阶段招生的百分之三十九。他们根据当地经济特点，开设了服装、民族工艺美术、种植、养殖等专业，这些专业的毕业生将在发展农村经济，帮助群众脱贫致富和开展民族地区的现代化建设等方面发挥作用。
    解放前，我国少数民族地区几乎没有大学。现在，全国民族自治地方已有普通高等学校一百零一所，有包括当地汉族学生在内的大学在校生十三万余人。民族地区就地培养人才的能力大大提高，缓解了当地人才需求矛盾。过去，少数民族高层次的专门人才凤毛麟角，现在，五十五个少数民族绝大部分都有一定数量的大学生，有的还有硕士、博士生。
    许多少数民族大学毕业生在生产、科研等战线作出了突出贡献。一九八四年荣获日本兽医学博士学位的蒙古族学者旭日干试验成功世界第一胎试管山羊。我国培养的第一名藏族博士生格乐撰写了第一部关于甘孜藏族自治州史的学术著作。在新疆维吾尔自治区，县以上少数民族领导干部中，就有中央民族学院的毕业生七百余人。
    在教育发展中，少数民族的优秀传统文化受到人们尊重。在民族学校中，宣传党的民族政策、维护祖国统一成为必不可少的教育内容。在普通中小学中，尊重少数民族意愿，广泛地采用民族语文授课或双语言教学。高中等专业学校招生时，允许用少数民族文字答卷。国家帮助编译少数民族文字教材。在高等学校中，开设了二十几种少数民族语言文学专业，还开设了民族学、民族史等专业，专门培养继承、研究少数民族文化的专业人才。
    随着对外开放，各民族互相交往、学习的机会增多，越来越多的少数民族群众已认识到学好汉语和外语的重要性。湘西州开展“拼音学话、注音识字、提前读书”的实验，使一年级的民族学生能平均识字一千四百多个，解决了学生学汉语的难题。
    回顾四十年的历程，新中国给民族教育带来了伟大的成就。
