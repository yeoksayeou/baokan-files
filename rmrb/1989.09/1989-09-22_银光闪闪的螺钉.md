The sun hangs over the pagoda, and the West River flows like a rainbow. By the river in Zhaoqing City, on the upper floor of a factory building along Yuejiang Road, there is a middle-aged man with a refined appearance, gazing at the scenery: the river water and the sky, displaying transparent, red, yellow, green, blue, black, white, gray, gold, and brown—ten colors, like the powder coatings produced by his factory.

Powder coatings are a new global technology, often referred to as the "star of the future" in the coating industry. Currently, most factories in China use oil-based paints, which easily produce "chemical fog," causing environmental pollution. Powder coatings not only have virtually no "chemical fog" but are also convenient to use, reduce energy consumption, and improve labor efficiency. Cars, home appliances, pipes, motors, garden facilities, aerospace machinery, and other items coated with powder coatings are durable and aesthetically pleasing. Previously, metal furniture exported from Guangdong Province to overseas markets often used traditional paint techniques. These items could not withstand the high temperatures and humidity of the equator or the corrosion of sea salt spray, often leading to returns. After adopting the factory's "Lingyang" brand powder coatings, 300,000 items were exported without damage, reaching overseas markets and earning foreign exchange for the country. This technology is a key project in the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

At this moment, the man's brows are tightly furrowed, his worries unabated. The reason is that a screw in the set of equipment imported from Switzerland for producing powder coatings has been damaged! It is called a "Nezhu" screw. In the machine, it serves a stirring function. Compared to the entire set of equipment, it is tiny, no more than 5 inches long, but without it, the machine cannot operate normally, and the products cannot meet the required quality. Often, seemingly insignificant things determine the fate of large objects. This screw can only be made in Switzerland, costing $10 each. Sending a telegram to purchase it and having it shipped from a distant country to Zhaoqing, the journey alone would take at least two months. If the factory stops production for one day, it would lose over 50,000 yuan and fail to remit 12,000 yuan in taxes and profits to the state. Moreover, it would affect the enterprise's reputation for "honoring contracts and keeping promises."

The worried man is named Chen Guangqiu. He comes from a family of tailors, graduated from Zhaoqing Chemical College, and has held positions such as deputy director of the political work group and deputy factory director. He has participated in the research and development of semiconductors, silicon wafers, and some chemical products. Currently, he is the director of Lingyang Powder Coatings Factory. He returns to his office, takes out the screw, and analyzes his own capabilities. First, after years of training, the factory has a strong technical team; second, to master the imported set of equipment, the Municipal Economic Commission had sent him and a technical staff member from the factory to study in Britain, and they are now familiar with every part of the equipment.

Chen Guangqiu shares his idea of manufacturing the Nezhu screw with the technical staff and workers. The echo from the mountains is always louder than the original sound.

The West River water rushes out of Lingyang Gorge, roaring and surging, with waves like thunder rolling from the sky. People with awareness and scientific strength are like the relentless West River, unafraid of twists and turns or cliffs; through hard work and dedication, they raise their heads: the Nezhu screw has been made! And it was successful on the first try!

The Nezhu screw is installed on the machine, and powder coatings in the colors of nature fly to every corner of the country.

A small screw, like a key, opens the iron chains that bind people's thoughts! Since we can make the Nezhu screw, we can also make larger parts and even machines!

Gazing at the West River, it seems to sing a song of screws, rushing towards the distance...

    银光闪闪的螺钉
    张永枚
    太阳挂在宝塔上，西江似流动的彩虹。江边肇庆市阅江路一座厂房的楼上，有位眉清目秀的壮年人，正凭栏眺望：江水云天，现出透明、红、黄、绿、蓝、黑、白、灰、金、棕10种光色，像他的工厂生产的粉末涂料。
    粉末涂料是世界新兴工艺，人称：涂装界明天的星辰。目前我国大多数厂家使用的油漆涂料，容易产生“化学毒雾”，造成环境污染。粉末涂料不仅基本没有“化学毒雾”，而且使用方便，降低能源消耗，提高劳动效率。经过喷涂粉末涂料的汽车、家电、管道、电机、园艺设施、航天机械等，耐用而美观。从前，广东省出口大洋彼岸的金属家具，由于大多采用传统油漆工艺，经不住赤道高温高热，大海盐雾的侵蚀，常被退货；采用他们厂生产的羚羊牌粉末涂料后，有30万件产品出口，无损运抵大洋彼岸，为国家赚取了外汇。这项工艺，是国家“七五”规划中重点发展项目。
    此时，那壮年人紧锁双眉，愁绪难消。原因是从瑞士等国引进的生产粉末涂料的成套设备，有一颗螺钉损坏了！它叫：尼阻钉。在机器中起搅拌作用。比起成套设备，它是缈小的，长不过5英寸，但没有它机器就不能正常运转，产品达不到应有质量。形似微末的东西，往往决定庞然大物的命运。这螺钉只有瑞士能制造，一颗价值10美元。发电报购置，从遥远的国度运到肇庆，路程辗转，少说也得两个月。工厂停产一天，就要损失5万多元，少向国家上交税利1.2万元。而且不能按期向订购单位发货，影响企业“重合同守信用”的声誉。
    这发愁的人名叫陈光球。他出身缝纫工人家庭，肇庆化工学院毕业，任过政工组干事、副厂长等职。参加过半导体、硅片及一些化工产品的研制。现任羚羊粉末涂料厂厂长。他回到办公室，拿起螺钉分析自己的实力。第一，经过多年锻炼，厂里有一支过得硬的科技队伍；第二，为了掌握引进的成套设备，市经委曾派他和厂里的一位科技人员到英国学习过，他俩已熟识了设备的每一个部件。
    陈光球把自己制造尼阻钉的想法，拿到科技人员、工人中去。群山的回声，总是比发声者的声音更响亮。
    西江水，冲出羚羊峡，怒吼澎湃，涛声似天外滚来惊雷。有觉悟有科学实力的人，就像一往无前的西江，曲折不怕，峡崖不怕；他们经过实干苦干，埋着的头昂扬起来：尼阻钉造出来了！而且一次成功！
    尼阻钉装上了机器，像美妙大自然色彩一样的粉末涂料，向全国各地飞去。
    小小螺钉，像一把钥匙，把束缚人们思想的铁锁打开了！既然能自己造出尼阻钉，同样也能造出大的配件以至机器！
    眺望西江水，仿佛唱着一曲螺钉之歌，奔向远方……
