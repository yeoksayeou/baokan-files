London is known as the "world's stage for music." Here, master musicians often gather, and there are numerous competitions. In particular, summer music festivals are prevalent, making them a significant feature of the city's social and cultural life.

The London Summer Music Festival has a long history. It is said that it has been held for hundreds of years. During the hot summer days, after a day's work, people would go outdoors to cool off and rest. Some enthusiastic artists would occasionally play and sing to entertain the crowd. Over time, this became a custom that continues to this day.

Today's London Summer Music Festival, whether in terms of scale or performance level, is far beyond what it used to be. They are usually held in open, quiet, and easily accessible parks, lawns, squares, and along the Thames River, mostly in the afternoon or evening. Of course, there are exceptions. The music festivals at St. Paul's and St. Lawrence's churches are scheduled for 12 noon each day. Many people would rather skip their coffee break and lunch to go listen to the music.

This summer, London was particularly hot, with daytime temperatures reaching over 30 degrees Celsius for nearly a month, a phenomenon not seen in nearly 60 years. Therefore, various scales and forms of music festivals were particularly numerous. Among them, the music festival at Goldwood Lake by the National Assembly in the northwest of London was the most attractive. Here, the mountains and lake are connected, the water is clear, the trees are lush, the birds sing, and the cicadas chirp, making it a quiet and cool place, the best place to be in the summer, and also a good place to hold a music festival. Since early June, 21 music festivals have been held here. Performers include the Royal Opera House Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and others. Many famous conductors have come to showcase their talents, and even the former Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who is over 80, did not avoid the heat, taking time off from his busy schedule to conduct a piece on the evening of June 10, adding color and luster to the entire music festival.

The appeal of the Goldwood Lake Music Festival lies in its diverse performances and wide-ranging programs. In terms of the repertoire, there are both domestic and foreign works; both classical masterpieces, such as works by Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and modern jazz music and popular lyrical ballads. In addition to instrumental performances, there are also vocal performances, including solo, chorus, and operatic excerpts, such as "The Big Bad Wolf," "Carmen," and "Madame Butterfly."

The purpose of the London Summer Music Festival is to enrich social and cultural life, improve citizens' musical appreciation, and promote and popularize music education. Therefore, most of the music festivals are free to enter, with free access. Only a very small number of them charge an entrance fee, but the ticket price is very low, and there are half-price discounts for students, disabled people, and the unemployed. The audience at the Goldwood Lake Music Festival is mostly free to watch, and on the slopes within nearly a kilometer, there are layers of people.

    伦敦夏季音乐会
    汪大钧
    伦敦素有“世界乐坛”之称。这里常常名师荟萃，赛事繁多，尤其是夏季音乐会盛行，成为此间社会文化生活的一大特色。
    伦敦夏季音乐会由来已久。据传，早在数百年前就有。盛夏时日，人们经过整天劳作之后，愿到户外乘凉小憩。有些好事艺人，间或作些弹奏、演唱，为人助兴。久之，人们变成习俗，直至今日。
    今日的伦敦夏季音乐会，无论就演奏规模或演奏水平而言，均非昔日可比。它们一般选择在开阔、清静而人们又易于到达的公园、草地、广场以及泰晤士河畔举行，时间大都在下午或者晚上。当然也有例外。圣保罗和圣劳伦两教堂的音乐会就安排在每日中午12时。许多人宁愿放弃工间喝咖啡和吃午饭而前去听音乐。
    今年夏季，伦敦特别炎热，白昼气温高达30摄氏度以上的日子将近一个月，为近60年未见。因此各种规模、形式的音乐会特别多。其中以伦敦西北郊国会山下、金伍德湖畔的音乐会最吸引人。这里山湖相连，水清木秀，鸟语蝉鸣，幽静凉爽，确是夏日的最佳去处，也是举办音乐会的良好场所。自6月初以来，这里已举办了21场音乐会。前来演奏的有英国皇家歌剧院乐团、皇家爱乐乐团、伦敦交响乐团、BBC交响乐团等。许多著名指挥家均来此一显身手，就连年逾古稀的前首相希思也不避酷暑，忙中偷闲，于6月10日晚来此领奏一曲，为整个音乐会增色添彩。
    金伍德湖音乐会的吸引人之处，在于它表演的多样性和节目的广泛性。以演奏的曲目而言，既有本国的，也有外国的；既有古典名作，诸如巴赫、莫扎特和贝多芬的作品，也有现代的爵士音乐和广为流行的抒情牧歌。除了乐曲演奏，还有演唱，包括独唱、合唱和表演，诸如《大灰狼》、《卡门》、《蝴蝶夫人》等歌剧片断。
    伦敦夏季音乐会的宗旨是丰富社会文化生活，提高公民的音乐鉴赏能力，推广和普及音乐教育。因此多数音乐会是免费入场，进出自由。其中只有极少一部分收费，但票价甚低，对于学生、残疾人和失业者还减半价。金伍德湖音乐会的听众中大多是自由观赏，在方圆近千米的山坡上，层层叠叠，尽为人群。
