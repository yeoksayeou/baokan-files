    Striving to Rise in the Central Region
    Guan Guangfu, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, Hubei has undergone a remarkable transformation. From the Gezhouba Dam, which stands tall at the Xiling Gorge and bisects the Yangtze River, to the integrated steel production belt along the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, including Wuhan Iron and Steel, Hubei Iron and Steel, and Huayuan Iron and Steel; from the new automobile city of Shiyan in the mountains of western Hubei, to the increasingly prosperous Jianghan Plain and the grain and cotton production base in the hilly areas of northern Hubei; from the growth of the metropolis of Wuhan, the provincial capital, to the rise of numerous small and medium-sized cities and towns, all these developments have erected monuments in the history of Hubei's socialist construction.

    Over the past 40 years, Hubei has formed an industrial system with a relatively complete range of industries, including electricity, steel, automobiles, machinery, light textiles, and chemicals. Fixed assets have increased by 117 times, and the total industrial output value has increased by 161 times. Agriculture has also developed rapidly, with the total output value increasing by 4.2 times. Over the past 10 years, grain production has remained stable, with per capita grain availability reaching 450 kilograms. Diversified operations have also seen significant development, with freshwater aquaculture ranking third in the country. Education, science and technology, culture, health, and sports, among other fields, have all made significant progress. In these 40 years, the decade of reform and opening up saw the fastest development. By 1987, the province's major economic indicators, including gross national product, total industrial and agricultural output value, and fiscal revenue, had all doubled two years ahead of schedule. These simple figures record the steps of Hubei people advancing bravely on the socialist road and mark Hubei as an important industrial and agricultural base in the country.

    A once-poor and backward Hubei has undergone a great transformation in the 40-year historical changes. However, compared to more advanced provinces and cities, there is still a significant gap; in terms of the grand goal of the Four Modernizations, it is only the beginning. Looking ahead, the task is arduous, and the journey is long. Especially in the current national context of developing socialist commodity economy and competition, Hubei, located in the central plains, faces a more severe challenge: either strive to rise in the central region, or risk becoming a mere valley in between. In the process of implementing the spirit of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the entire province, through in-depth analysis of the national situation and provincial conditions, has reached a consensus: Hubei must choose the former: strive to rise in the central region. This is a goal we can achieve through our efforts and a contribution we should make to the cause of the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China.

    Hubei is located at the junction of east and west, north and south, with the Yangtze River and Han River, two golden waterways, running through the province, and the Beijing-Guangzhou, Jiaozuo-Liuzhou, and Chuan-Hu-Guang railway lines connecting all the province's major and medium-sized cities, encompassing the fertile Jianghan Plain. Striving to rise in the central region has clear locational and economic advantages. To this end, we have focused on the development and opening up of the Yangtze River line, establishing several experimental zones and forming an economic belt along the river. This way, we can use the Yangtze River economic belt as a leader to drive the entire province's economy, while strengthening economic ties with coastal areas and opening up to the outside world, preparing for and laying the foundation for the future strengthening of economic development in the central region.

    In the province's economic development strategy, we have adopted the principle of focusing on key areas and strengthening the foundation. First, we will focus on the construction of the two major agricultural bases: the Jianghan Plain, known as the "water bag," and the hilly areas of northern Hubei, known as the "dry bag," to strengthen the agricultural foundation. Second, we will focus on the construction of key projects such as the "double 700" renovation of Wuhan Iron and Steel, the production of 300,000 small cars by Second Automobile Works, the 1.2 million kilowatt Geheyan Hydropower Station, and the 1.2 million kilowatt Hanchuan Thermal Power Plant, to strengthen the foundation of energy, transportation, and raw materials industries. The strengthening of these two "foundations" will enhance the momentum for future development and provide reliable guarantees. Starting from the basic provincial situation that Hubei is an important old industrial and agricultural production base in the country, Hubei must strive to rise in the central region, relying on self-reliance, hard work, and a development path that emphasizes internal growth. We are committed to using new technologies to systematically transform traditional industries and build agricultural bases, making this old industrial and agricultural base of Hubei rejuvenate. While strengthening the two "foundations," we will leverage the advantages of abundant agricultural and resource bases to vigorously develop "light industries," ensuring effective supply and accelerating the accumulation of funds. In terms of regional layout, considering that Hubei has a large area of impoverished mountainous regions, which are mostly revolutionary old base areas, minority areas, and reservoir areas, we will adhere to the principle of combining selection with poverty alleviation. We will give priority to the economic advantages of relatively developed regions with high input-output efficiency, while wholeheartedly supporting impoverished mountainous regions to quickly solve the problems of subsistence and poverty alleviation. This is both a need for the province's economic development and a serious political task.

    The great achievements of the past 40 years since the founding of the nation have convincingly proven that the development and progress of socialism are unstoppable. The people of Hubei, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, will unswervingly implement the basic line of the Party, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, adhere to hard work, and rely on science and technology. With full confidence, we will strive to achieve the grand development goals set by the central government.

    奋力在中部崛起
    中共湖北省委书记　关广富
    建国以来40年，湖北大地面貌一新，发生了可喜的巨变。从壁立西陵峡口、腰斩长江的葛洲坝水利枢纽工程，到武钢——鄂钢——冶钢等连成一体的鄂东长江冶金带；从鄂西北大山中崛起的一座新型汽车城——十堰二汽，到日益繁荣的江汉平原和鄂北岗地粮棉商品生产基地；从省会特大城市武汉的壮大，到星罗棋布的中小城市和集镇的兴起，所有这些，都在湖北社会主义建设史上树起了一座座丰碑。
    40年来，湖北形成了以电力、钢铁、汽车和机械、轻纺、化工等几大产业为支柱，门类比较齐全的工业体系，固定资产增长了117倍，工业总产值增长了161倍。农业也有了迅速发展，总产值增长了4.2倍。10年来，保持了粮食的稳定增长，人均占有的粮食达到450公斤；多种经营也有很大发展，淡水水产列全国第3位。教育、科技、文化、卫生、体育等各项事业都有了长足发展。在这40年间，尤以改革开放的10年发展最快，到1987年，全省国民生产总值、工农业总产值、财政收入等主要经济指标都提前两年翻了一番。这些简单的数据，纪录了湖北人民在社会主义道路上奋勇前进的步伐，标志着湖北已成为全国重要的工业基地和农业基地。
    一个贫穷落后的湖北，在40年风云际会的伟大历史变革中发生了巨变，然而同先进省市相比，还有较大差距；从四个现代化建设的宏伟目标来说，仅仅是个开端。展望未来，大业弥艰，任重道远。尤其在当前全国发展社会主义商品经济的竞争态势下，地处中原腹地的湖北面临更为严峻的挑战：要么奋力拚搏，那就可能实现在中部崛起；要么无所作为，那就难免沦为中间谷地。在贯彻党的十三大精神的过程中，全省上下通过对全国形势和省情的深入分析求得共识，湖北只能作前一种抉择：奋力在中部崛起，这是我们经过努力能够达到的目标，也是我们在实现四化、振兴中华的伟业中应当作出的贡献。
    湖北在全国处于承东连西、南北交流的结合部位，贯穿全境的长江、汉江两条黄金水道和京广、焦柳、川鄂赣三大铁路线联结了我省所有的大中城市，囊括了富饶的江汉平原。争取在中部崛起，有着明显的区位优势和经济优势。为此，我们把长江沿线的开放开发作为重点，先后建立了若干试验区，形成沿江经济带。这样，就能以长江经济带为先导，把全省经济带动起来，同时加强同沿海的经济联系和对外开放，为迎接今后全国加强中部地带的经济发展做好准备，奠定基础。
    在全省的经济发展战略中，确定了突出重点、加强基础的方针。一是抓好江汉平原治理
  “水袋子”和鄂北岗地治理“旱包子”两大农业基地的建设，强化农业基础；二是搞好武钢“双七百”改造、二汽新上30万辆小汽车、隔河岩120万千瓦水电站和汉川120万千瓦火电厂等重点项目建设，加强能源、交通、原材料等基础工业。这两个“基础”的加强，为今后的发展增强了后劲，又提供可靠保证。从湖北是全国重要的工农业生产老基地这个基本省情出发，湖北要争取在中部崛起，必须立足于自力更生、艰苦创业、走内涵发展为主的道路。我们正在致力于用新技术有系统地改造传统产业和建设农业基地，使湖北这个老工农业基地焕发青春。在加强两个“基础”的同时，依托农业和资源丰富的优势，大力发展“大轻工”，以保障有效供给和加快资金的积累。在地区布局上，从湖北省贫困山区面积大，其中又大都是革命老根据地、少数民族地区、库区的实际情况出发，坚持择优与扶贫结合的方针，既要优先发挥经济比较发达地区投入产出效益高的优势，又要满腔热情地扶持贫困山区尽快解决温饱和脱贫问题，这既是全省经济发展的需要，也是一个严肃的政治任务。
    建国40年的巨大成就，雄辩地证明了社会主义的发展和前进是不可阻挡的。具有光荣革命传统的湖北人民将坚定不移地贯彻党的基本路线，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，坚持艰苦创业，坚持依靠科技，满怀信心地为实现中央提出的宏伟发展目标奋勇前进。（附图片）
