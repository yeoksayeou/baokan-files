Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 8th.

Beijing Municipal Government today urged those who seized and hid firearms and ammunition during the counter-revolutionary riots to immediately surrender their weapons and seek lenient treatment; those who continue to resist and refuse to surrender will face severe legal penalties.

At today's Beijing Municipal Firearms Surrender Policy Implementation Conference, Meng Fanjun and seven other individuals who seized and hid firearms and refused to surrender were sentenced by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court to between two and thirteen years' imprisonment. For those who turned themselves in and voluntarily surrendered their firearms, such as Liu Shiming and seven others, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that no charges would be pressed, and they were released on the spot after signing a statement of repentance.

Beijing Municipal Vice Mayor Su Zhongxiang said at the meeting that most of the firearms and ammunition seized and scattered during the counter-revolutionary riots by the martial law troops have been recovered, but some have not. These firearms and ammunition, if left scattered in society, pose a serious threat to the safety of the National Day celebrations, the capital, and the general public.

He pointed out that those who have not yet surrendered their firearms and ammunition should understand that seizing and hiding firearms and ammunition is a criminal act, and their only way out is to dispel their doubts, immediately surrender their firearms, and seek lenient treatment. The conference required all units, streets, and townships in Beijing to thoroughly recover firearms and ammunition as an important part of the investigation work, strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in this regard. The government will strictly keep the identity of informants confidential, reward those who provide valuable information, and hold those who know but do not report or harbor criminals accountable according to the law.

    抢夺私藏枪支弹药者
    要立即主动交出武器
    北京市召开收缴枪支政策兑现大会
    新华社北京9月8日电　北京市人民政府今天敦促在反革命暴乱期间抢夺、私藏枪支弹药的人立即主动交出武器，争取从宽处理；如果继续抗拒不交，必将受到法律的严厉制裁。
    在今天召开的北京市收缴枪支政策兑现大会上，孟凡军等7名抢夺和私藏枪支、拒不交出的罪犯，被北京市中级人民法院分别判处2年到13年有期徒刑；对投案自首、主动交出枪支的刘世明等7人，北京市公安局宣布，不予追究、具结悔过，当场释放。
    北京市副市长苏仲祥在会上说，反革命暴乱期间戒严部队被抢夺、散落在社会上的枪支弹药多数已经收回，但还有一部分没有收回来。这些枪支弹药继续散落在社会上，对国庆节的安全、对首都和广大群众的安全都是严重的隐患。
    他指出，那些至今没有交出枪支弹药的人应该明白，抢夺、私藏枪支弹药是犯罪行为，他们的唯一出路是打消顾虑，立即主动交出枪支，争取宽大处理。大会要求在京的一切单位、街道、乡镇要把彻底收缴枪支弹药作为清查工作的重要内容，加强领导，发动群众，把这项工作做好。政府将为举报人严格保密，重奖检举有功者，对知情不举、包庇窝藏罪犯者，要根据情节轻重依法追究法律责任。
