The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group resumed its work after a three-month hiatus, holding its 13th plenary session in London today.

The session will last for three days. The Chinese delegation is led by Chief Representative Ambassador Ke Zaixiu, while the British delegation is led by Chief Representative, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Malcolm Rifkind.

The 13th session of the Sino-British Liaison Group was originally scheduled to be held in London in July. After the June 4th incident in Beijing, Britain unilaterally announced the postponement of the meeting, disrupting the normal work of the Joint Liaison Group. The Chinese government had expressed regret over this.

Today's meeting lasted nearly three and a half hours. After the meeting, Chinese Chief Representative Ke Zaixiu told reporters that this meeting is an important one held after the suspension of the Liaison Group for several months. During this period, many issues have arisen regarding the relations between the two countries and the situation in Hong Kong. This morning, both sides conducted extensive and frank discussions on these issues.

    中英联合联络小组复会
    新华社伦敦9月27日电（记者薛永兴）中英联合联络小组在中断了3个月工作之后，今天在伦敦开始举行第十三次全体会议。
    这次会议将举行3天。中方首席代表柯在铄大使和英方首席代表、外交部助理次官麦若彬分别率代表团参加会议。
    中英联络小组第十三次会议原定于今年7月在伦敦举行。在6月北京平息反革命暴乱之后，英国单方面宣布推迟开会日期，中断了联合联络小组的正常工作。中国政府曾对此表示遗憾。
    今天会议举行了近3个半小时。会议结束后，中方首席代表柯在铄向记者表示，这次会议是在联络小组中断了几个月之后举行的一次重要会议。在此期间，在两国关系和香港局势方面产生了许多问题，今天上午双方就这些问题进行了广泛和坦率的讨论。
