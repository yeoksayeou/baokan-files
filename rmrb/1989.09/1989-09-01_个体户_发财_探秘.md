**The Mystery of Individual Household Wealth**

Regarding the issue of individual household wealth, I had a discussion with colleagues from the county tax bureau. The following is a transcript of our conversation:

**Topic One: Have Individual Households Become Wealthy?**

**Question:** Currently, many people have opinions about the unfairness in social distribution, particularly about "individual households becoming wealthy." As a department responsible for regulating social distribution and directly involved in individual tax collection, what is your opinion on whether individual households have become wealthy?

**JIANG ZHONGGANG** (26 years of tax work experience): From our county's perspective, over 90% of individual households have incomes higher than farmers, workers, government officials, and intellectuals. Generally, their incomes are 2 to 3 times higher, and in some cases, up to 11 times higher. Their wealth is evident in the following ways:

1. **More Assets:** Among the 5029 tax-paying individual households in our county, most have fixed and liquid assets around 10,000 yuan. About 30% have assets exceeding 10,000 yuan, and 10% have nearly 100,000 yuan. In contrast, typical farming households have assets below 5,000 yuan, with very few exceeding 10,000 yuan.

2. **Better Housing:** They build houses that typically cost over 10,000 yuan.

3. **Higher Living Standards:** Their food, clothing, and household items are generally of higher quality compared to others.

**Question:** Are there individual households with lower incomes?

**JIANG:** Yes, but they are in the minority, mainly those who are not good at managing their businesses. Of course, incomes vary among different types of individual households. Those engaged in agricultural and sideline product processing earn less than those in industrial production and commerce. The wealthiest are the "speculators" who buy and sell goods.

**Topic Two: What Kind of Wealth Have Individual Households Accumulated?**

**Question:** Is the wealth of individual households earned through honest labor?

**JIANG:** Some have accumulated wealth mainly through tax evasion and avoidance.

**Question:** Do you have evidence?

**ZOU SHUSHEN** (Local Tax Division Director): As a department responsible for regulating social distribution, the state tax authorities consider the principle of social distribution balance when formulating tax policies. For example, a "husband-and-wife shop" with a monthly business volume of around 10,000 yuan has a profit of about 1,000 yuan. Out of this, 100 yuan is used to pay for business management fees, rent, transportation, and other expenses. After paying 500 yuan in "business tax" (5% of the business volume), they are left with about 300 yuan in net income. This net income is slightly higher than the monthly salary of a dual-income household. This shows that individual households, if they pay taxes according to the law, will not have significantly higher incomes than others. If their incomes are significantly higher, it is likely due to tax evasion and avoidance.

**Question:** If an individual household increases investment, making the monthly business volume reach 100,000 yuan, and if they earn 3,000 yuan profit from a business volume of 10,000 yuan through overpricing or other improper means, isn't their wealth accumulation unrelated to tax evasion and avoidance?

**ZOU:** It is still related. The state stipulates that for any part of the monthly net income exceeding 800 yuan, additional "personal income tax" must be paid according to the proportion. In the two examples you mentioned, after paying the "personal income tax," their annual net income would still be less than 20,000 yuan.

**Question:** Can you estimate the tax evasion and avoidance situation for all individual households in the county?

**LUO YINGXIAN** (32 years of tax work experience): Yes. Last year, our county collected a total of 298.8 million yuan in taxes from individual households. Based on this figure, the average tax paid per tax-paying individual household is 596 yuan. Considering the example of the "husband-and-wife shop" paying 500 yuan in taxes and having a net income of about 300 yuan, the ratio of taxes paid to net income is roughly 5:3. From this, we can infer that last year's tax collection for individual households was based on an average annual net income of 357 yuan per household. Last year, the per capita annual net income in our county was 474 yuan. Obviously, individual households paying taxes based on an annual net income of 357 yuan indicates a significant amount of tax evasion and avoidance. According to our investigation, almost all tax-paying individual households in the county have engaged in tax evasion and avoidance to varying degrees. The best cases evade 50% of their taxes, while the worst evade 80%; some evade taxes amounting to tens of thousands of yuan; and some have been evading taxes for multiple years. For example, 10 individual households in Taiping Town processing "powder glue strong thread" evaded taxes for 4 years. Local residents filed complaints, and upon investigation, we found they had evaded 86,558 yuan in taxes.

**Topic Three: Why Have Individual Households Become Wealthy?**

**Question:** Tax evasion and avoidance by individual households are serious. What are the reasons?

**LUO:** One reason is exploiting policy loopholes. Our country's main policies and supporting policies are implemented sequentially, and individual households take advantage of these "time gaps" to evade and avoid taxes. Previously, our commodity production system was fragmented into production, supply, and sales. Tax authorities knew exactly where individual households sourced their goods and how much money they spent, ensuring they paid taxes accurately. Now, many places have integrated production, supply, and sales, allowing producers to sell goods and anyone to engage in wholesale and retail. This way, individual households can source goods from all over, making it difficult for tax authorities to track their activities accurately. As a result, tax collection is based on their declarations and the tax authorities' estimates, leading to actual tax payments being much lower than the required amounts.

**Question:** Has the state not formulated corresponding restrictive policies?

**JIANG:** It has. In 1983, the state implemented the "wholesale withholding" tax policy, which requires wholesale units to withhold the business tax from buyers when selling goods. However, some individual households still exploit loopholes: they avoid units that implement wholesale withholding. Many wholesale units, to attract individual households to buy their goods, violate policies by reducing or not implementing wholesale withholding. If asked why tax authorities do not pursue these units, the sheer number of wholesale units and the complexity of their accounts make it impossible for a few tax officials to track every transaction. If they pursue certain units, these units might apologize, "We made a mistake, we'll correct it next time." But the next time, it's the same old story.

**Question:** Why not impose strict penalties on such practices?

**LUO:** There is no specific policy for that. From the county's implementation, we have not penalized wholesale withholding units but only required them to pay the taxes owed. Even if we strictly penalize such practices, other individual households might stop buying from our county's wholesale units, leading to a loss of market for our county's goods, which would be detrimental to our own interests!

Another reason for tax evasion and avoidance by individual households is exploiting the "reform climate." At the beginning of the reform, the central government proposed "letting some people get rich first" and advocated for the development of private enterprises. Some of our comrades might have misunderstood this spirit, leading to excessive favoritism towards individual households. Some party and government leaders feel that their performance is lacking if their units do not have a few notable individual households, thus providing "preferential cultivation." Our tax department also once favored individual households, and it was during this period that many individual households began evading and avoiding taxes. Our county had a model individual household who, in 1985, was found to have evaded 12,000 yuan in taxes over three years. When we asked her to pay the taxes owed, she cried and sought help from various levels of leaders, saying she "could not afford to pay this money." The leaders, fearing the "red flag" would fall, intervened with the tax department. We reduced her tax to 9,000 yuan and lent her 3,500 yuan from the tax bureau's operational funds as "working capital." Additionally, due to lax ideological and political education and tax law propaganda, an improper social atmosphere formed, providing a protective network for some individual households to evade and avoid taxes. Some individual households, influenced by the "money worship" trend, used various means to evade tax inspections, leading to the worsening of tax evasion and avoidance.

**Question:** Is this tax evasion and avoidance problem worsening or improving?

**ZOU:** From our county's perspective, it is improving. Last year, our county's tax collection from individual and market households increased by 47.7% compared to the previous year, and in the first half of this year, it increased by 47% compared to the same period last year. However, this "improvement" is still far from the actual amount that should be collected, and we need to continue our efforts.

These three tax officials believe that due to tax evasion and avoidance by individual households, some of them have excessively high incomes, leading to significant disparities in social distribution and harming national interests. They hope that the entire society will pay attention to and solve this problem.

    个体户“发财”探秘
    就个体户的致富问题，我同本县税务局的同志进行了一次座谈。笔录如下：
      话题之一：个体户是不是发了财
    问：现在不少人对社会分配不公有看法，尤其对“个体户发了财”议论多。你们是调节社会分配的职能部门，又是直接从事个体税收征管工作，你们认为个体户是不是发了财？
    江中刚（从事税务工作26年）：从我县情况看，90％以上的个体户，收入高于农民、工人、机关干部和知识分子。一般要高二至三倍，多的可达11倍以上。他们钱多的具体表现是：
  （一）拥有的资产多。我县5029户纳税个体工商户中，一般业户的固定、流动资产在万元左右，30％的资产过万元，10％的近10万。而一般种田农户的资产在5000元以下，绝少过万元；
  （二）住房好。他们建房大都耗资万元以上；（三）生活水平高。嘴里吃的，身上穿的，家里摆的，差不多都高于其他人。
    问：有没有收入不高的个体户？
    江：有，只是少数，主要是那些不善于经营的人。当然，各类个体户收入也不平衡。从事农副产品加工的，不如从事工业生产和经商的。最富的是那些买空卖空的“倒爷”。
        话题之二：个体户发了什么财
    问：个体户发的“财”是不是诚实劳动所得呢？
    江：其中有的人主要是靠偷税、漏税发了财。
    问：有根据吗？
    邹树森（地方税股股长）：作为调节社会分配的职能部门，国家税务机关在制订税收政策时，是充分考虑了社会分配大体平衡这个首要前提的。如：一家月营业额在万元左右的
  “夫妻店”，其利润为千元左右。这1000元中，要支付工商管理费、房租、运费、损耗等费用100多元，再上交占营业额5％的“营业税”500元，就剩300多元纯收入了。这“纯收入”，刚好略高于一户双职工的月工资。由此看出，个体户只要依法纳税，其收入不会高出他类人员很多。高出很多，肯定与偷税、漏税有关系。
    问：假如个体户通过增加投资使月营业额高达100万元，又假如个体户通过卖高价或其它不正当手段使万元营业额赚取3000元的利润，他的“发财”不是与偷、漏税没关系吗？
    邹：也有关系。国家规定，凡月纯收入超过800元以上的部分，还要按比例交纳“个人所得税”。你刚才假设的这两例，根据计算，他们交纳了“个人所得税”后，年净收入也还不到两万元。
    问：你们能对全县个体户偷漏税的情况作个估计吗？
    罗应贤（从事税务工作32年）：可以。去年我县收取个体户税款共298.8万元，按此数计算，全县纳税个体户每户才平均交税596元。以刚才所举“夫妻店”交500元税其自身只得300多元纯收入等情况看，个体户上交税款和自得纯收入的比例大体为5∶3。由此推算，去年我县对个体户的征税额，是按每户年均纯收入357元的比例收取的。去年我县人均年纯收入已达474元。显然，个体户每户按年纯收入357元纳税，偷漏税额是很大的。据我们调查，全县纳税个体户几乎程度不同都有偷漏税行为。测算结果表明，最好的户每年少交50％的税款，差的要少交80％；数量多的，偷漏税上万元；偷漏税时间长的，连续多年。我县太平镇10户加工“粉胶强力丝”的个体户，偷漏税长达4年。当地群众群起告状，我们一查，发现他们偷漏税款86558元。
      话题之三：个体户为啥能发财
    问：个体户偷漏税严重，什么原因？
    罗：一是钻了政策上的空子。我们国家的主体政策和配套性政策的出台，有先有后，个体户们就利用了“有先有后”的“时间差”偷税、漏税。过去我国的商品生产体制是产、供、销各自为政。个体户在哪里进货，用钱多少，税务部门了如指掌，个体户按额纳税一分也短不了。现在不少地方把产、供、销融为一体，生产者可以出售商品，任何人都可搞批、零经营。这样，个体户天南海北到处进货，你税务部门纵有天大本事，也查不实个体户到底在什么地方，进了多少东西。这样，征税时只能按他的申报加税务部门的“估计”。结果，实纳税额就大大低于应纳税额。
    问：国家没有制订相应的制约性政策吗？
    江：制订了。1983年，国家制订了“批发代扣”的税收政策，其基本内容是，让批发单位批发商品时，扣掉购买者应交纳的营业税。但有的个体户还钻空子：谁搞批发代扣，我就不到谁那里进货。许多批发单位为了让个体户买自己的商品，只好违背政策，少搞批发代扣，或不搞批发代扣。如果问，税务部门为啥不追究这些单位呢？批发单位那么多，每个单位批发商品的帐目又那么杂，区区几个税务干部哪能笔笔不漏地追究得过来呢？如果追究到某些单位，他们就连做检讨：“搞错了，下次改。”可到了下次，仍是老一套。
    问：为什么不对这种现象严加处罚呢？
    罗：还没有这样的具体政策。从全县执行情况看，我们也没有对代扣税单位进行处罚，只是要求补税而已。即使我们对这种现象强行重罚，其他个体户不再到本县批发单位买东西，那样，本县商品甚至会失去本县市场，这不砸了自己的“饭碗”？！
    个体户偷漏税的另一个原因是“钻改革‘气候’的空子”。改革之初，中央提出“让一部分人先富起来”，并提倡发展私营经济，我们有些同志对这个精神的理解，或许有偏差，以致特别“宠爱”个体户。一些党政领导觉得本单位没有几个象样的个体户就“政绩不佳”，于是“优惠培养”。我们的税务部门也一度对个体户从优从惠，正是趁着这种气候，许多个体户开始搞起偷漏税来。我们县有个模范个体户，1985年，我们查出她3年漏税12000元，让其补交税款时，她哭着找到各级领导，说自己“交不起这些钱”。领导们怕这面“红旗”倒了，找到税务部门做工作。我们将其税款降至9000元，又从税务局办公费中，借给她3500元做“周转金”。另外，由于放松了思想政治教育和税法的宣传教育，社会上的不正之风形成了为某些个体户偷漏税做庇护的“关系网”，一些个体户在主观上受到“拜金主义”思潮的影响，采取多种手段逃避税收检查，使偷漏税问题得以恶性发展。
    问：这种偷漏税问题是愈演愈烈，还是趋于好转呢？
    邹：从我县看是趋于好转。去年我县收取的个体、集贸市场税收，比前年上升47.7％，今年上半年又比去年同期上升47％。但这种“好转”离实际应征额差距还很大，今后还应努力。
    这3位税务干部认为，由于个体户偷漏税，使他们之中一些人收入过高，造成了社会各阶层的分配悬殊，损害了国家利益。他们希望全社会都来重视、解决这个问题。
