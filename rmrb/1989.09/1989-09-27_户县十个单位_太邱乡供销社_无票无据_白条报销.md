Hu County City Investigation Team Chen Xuhui wrote to the newspaper: In our county, there are 10 administrative units that have violated financial discipline by using blank receipts for accounting. After investigation, there are 59 blank receipts totaling 4,351 yuan. The existence of blank receipts and fake invoices for accounting has brought many difficulties to the audit supervision work.

Recently, the supply and marketing cooperative of Yongcheng County, Henan, checked the financial accounts of the Taiqiu Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative and found that there were 130.6 million yuan of problematic funds, accounting for 80% of the total funds. The main problem is the lack of tickets and vouchers, and the use of blank receipts for reimbursement. In May last year, the deputy director of the Taiqiu Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Han Jianyu, entrusted someone to purchase 290 tons of low-quality phosphate fertilizer, with various expenditures totaling 28,300 yuan. These expenses, except for part of the train tickets, were all reimbursed with blank receipts.

    户县十个单位　太邱乡供销社
    无票无据　白条报销
    陕西户县城调队陈旭辉来信：我县有10个行政单位存在违反财经纪律，白条入账现象。经查，共有白条单据59张，金额达4351元。由于白条入账和开假发票入账的存在，给审计监督工作带来了很多困难。
    河南永城县委曾昭晨　吕武星　王晓五来信：最近，我县供销社检查了太邱乡供销社的财务账目，发现有问题资金达130.6万元，占资金总额的80％。其主要问题是：无票无据，白条报销。去年5月，太邱乡供销社副主任韩建玉托人购进磷肥290多吨，系低劣产品，各项支出2.83万元。这些开支除部分车票外，均以白条报销。
