The people of Guangdong have striven for five years, and more than 50 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation in the entire province have basically been covered in green. Forest resources have been further restored and cultivated, and forest ecosystems have begun to enter a positive cycle.

Guangdong, known for its "seven parts mountains, two parts water, and one part fields," enjoys a mild climate year-round and abundant rainfall. It has long been one of the major timber-producing provinces in China. At the beginning of liberation, the province's forest area was over 55 million mu, with a timber stock of 150 million cubic meters and a forest coverage rate of 17.6%. Over the past few decades, due to excessive logging and reckless felling, the annual logging volume has consistently exceeded the growth rate of timber. By the early 1980s, the annual forest deficit still reached several million cubic meters. The forest resources in Guangdong faced the threat of depletion.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China raised the sails of rural reform. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the provincial government firmly implemented forestry policies, promptly resolved forestry disputes, and stabilized forestry order. While strengthening timber management, they boldly opened up the timber market in collective forestry areas, directly linking producers with production materials and production outcomes. On this basis, they seized the opportunity to transform the fundamental guiding ideology of forestry development. First, they shifted from the single, rigid, and long-cycle "small forestry," which focused solely on planting trees and logging, to a comprehensive development and utilization of "big forestry," combining long-term and short-term goals. They tackled the economic vicious cycle in mountainous areas and the ecological vicious cycle in forestry.

In 1985, the Guangdong Provincial Committee and the provincial government issued a call to "eliminate barren hills in five years and green Guangdong in ten years." They adopted hard measures such as "the top leader takes charge, and each level establishes green points and issues military orders." Including the provincial committee secretary, the top leaders of the province, city, and county all took the lead in going to the areas with the most barren hills and the greatest difficulties to establish afforestation points, organizing and assisting farmers in developing barren hills and planting trees and fruits. County committee secretaries issued "military orders" to green their respective counties, and leaders at all levels implemented the term responsibility system for afforestation. The provincial committee and the provincial government organized inspections of each county annually, penalizing those who did not perform well in afforestation and rewarding those who did. Policies were implemented year by year. Leaders and departments at all levels established over 12,000 afforestation points in the countryside, planting trees and fruits over 9.95 million mu.

    层层办绿化点　级级立军令状
    绿染广东变成现实
    全省宜林荒山基本披上绿装
    据新华社广州电　（记者雷仲予、黄扬略）广东人民奋斗5年，全省5000多万亩宜林荒山基本上披上绿装，森林资源进一步得到恢复和培育，森林生态开始转上良性循环。
    拥有“七山二水一分田”的广东，四季如春，雨量充沛，历来都是我国木材主产省份之一。解放初期，全省森林面积5500多万亩，林木蓄积量1.5亿立方米，森林覆盖率17.6％。近几十年间，由于重采轻育，乱砍滥伐，砍伐量年年超过林木生长量，80年代初，每年森林赤字仍达几百万立方米。南粤森林资源面临枯竭的威胁。
    党的十一届三中全会的春风，鼓起了农村体制改革之帆。中共广东省委、省政府坚定不移地落实山林政策，及时处理山林纠纷，稳定了山林秩序；在加强林木管理的同时，大胆放开集体林区的木材市场，使生产者与生产资料、生产成果直接结合。在这个基础上，他们不失时机地变革林业发展的根本指导思想。首先将单一、呆板、周期长，以种树砍木头为唯一内容的“小林业”，转变为全面开发、综合利用、长短结合的“大林业”，从治理山区经济恶性循环入手，治理林业生态恶性循环。
    广东省委、省政府1985年向全省发出“5年消灭荒山，10年绿化广东大地”的号召，并采取“一把手抓，抓一把手；层层办绿化点，级级立军令状”等硬措施，包括省委书记在内的省、市、县党政第一把手，带头下到荒山最多，困难最大的地方办造林绿化点，组织、帮助农民开发荒山，造林种果；各县县委书记立下绿化本县的“军令状”，各级基层领导也层层落实造林绿化的任期目标责任制；省委、省政府每年组织力量对各县进行大检查，造林绿化不力者罚，有功者奖，政策年年兑现。各级领导和部门下乡办造林绿化点1.2万多个，造林种果995万亩。
