At the invitation of the Chinese government, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China from December 19 to 23, 1988, for an official friendly visit. This was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to China in 34 years. During the visit, Prime Minister Gandhi exchanged views and opinions with Chinese leaders on bilateral relations and international issues of mutual interest, deepening mutual understanding. Both sides emphasized that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly advocated by China and India, are the most vital principles for guiding interstate relations and are also the basic guiding principles for establishing a new international political and economic order. Both sides agreed to make further efforts to restore, improve, and develop friendly neighborly relations between China and India based on these principles. The leaders of both countries agreed to resolve the China-India border issue through peaceful and friendly consultations. During the visit, the two governments signed the "Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation," the "Agreement on Civil Aviation Transport," and the "Agreement on Cultural Cooperation 1988, 1989, and 1990 Exchange Implementation Plan."

The main unresolved issue between China and India is the border issue. Since 1981, the two countries have held eight rounds of official-level talks to resolve the border issue. Although no substantial progress has been made, mutual understanding has increased, and both sides have agreed to develop friendly relations between the two countries, creating a good atmosphere and conditions for resolving the border issue.

    同印度改善关系
    应中国政府的邀请，印度总理拉吉夫·甘地于1988年12月19日至23日对中国进行了正式友好访问。这是34年来印度总理首次访华。访问期间，拉·甘地总理同中国领导人就双边关系及双方共同感兴趣的国际问题广泛交换了看法和意见，增进了相互了解。双方强调，由中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则最有生命力，是搞好国与国关系的基本指导原则，也是建立国际政治新秩序和国际经济新秩序的基本指导原则，双方将在这些原则基础上，为恢复、改善和发展中印两国睦邻友好关系进一步作出努力。两国领导人同意通过和平友好方式协商解决中印边界问题。访问期间，两国政府签署了“科学技术合作协定”、“民用航空运输协定”和“文化合作协定1988、1989和1990年交流执行计划”。
    中印两国之间悬而未决的问题主要是边界问题。1981年以来，两国就解决边界问题举行过8轮官员会谈，虽然没有取得实质性进展，但增加了相互了解，双方一致同意发展两国之间的友好关系，为解决边界问题创造了良好的气氛和条件。
