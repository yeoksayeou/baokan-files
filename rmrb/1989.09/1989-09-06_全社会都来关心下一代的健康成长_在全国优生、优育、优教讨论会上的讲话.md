Comrades,

On the eve of the upcoming Teachers' Day, the All-China Women's Federation and the National Committee for the Coordination of Children and Youth Affairs are convening the "Discussion on Optimal Birth, Upbringing, and Education." This is a very meaningful event. I am very pleased to attend this meeting today. I would like to share a few thoughts to express the concern and importance that the Party Central Committee and the State Council place on this work.

Children and adolescents are the hope and future of the Chinese nation. To build our country from a populous developing nation into a prosperous and powerful socialist modernized nation, we not only need the hard work of the current generation but also the persistent efforts of several generations. Promoting optimal birth, upbringing, and education aims to create the necessary conditions to cultivate our new generation into people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. This is a necessity for improving national quality and for the prosperity and strength of our socialist motherland. The children of today will, in a few years, a decade, or two decades, enter society and join various fronts of socialist construction. It can be foreseen that by the beginning of the 21st century, the historical mission will inevitably fall on the shoulders of the new generation. Therefore, comprehensively studying and exploring how to better strengthen children and youth work in the new situation is a matter of strategic significance. It should attract the attention of party committees and governments at all levels and should receive the support of the entire society!

Researching optimal birth, upbringing, and education involves studying the cultivation of infants, young children, children, and adolescents from the aspects of birth, upbringing, and education. This is a comprehensive interdisciplinary and cross-departmental endeavor, a field that previous generations have not deeply mastered. Since liberation, under the loving care of the Party and the government, our country has eradicated many infectious and epidemic diseases among infants and young children, significantly reduced infant mortality rates, improved people's living standards, and most children and adolescents are growing up healthily. However, in our country, there are still many problems and weak links in the work of optimal birth, upbringing, and education. It is necessary and urgent to study these issues and formulate relevant policies.

The cultivation of "infants, young children, children, and adolescents" is a matter closely related to the interests of the broad masses and involves every household in society. We must address outdated concepts in birth, upbringing, and education, promote scientific knowledge, and gradually help the broad masses establish the concept of optimal birth, master the methods of optimal upbringing, and correct educational ideas. Parents, kindergartens, and schools, in addition to ensuring the physical health of children and their normal development, must pay special attention to cultivating children's good morals and behavior habits. From infancy, education in knowledge, culture, and ideological morality should be conducted according to their characteristics. In our country, there are many only children. How to educate them is a new challenge for the broad childcare workers. Parents and teachers should love and care for them, but they should not be indulged or spoiled. From a young age, we should cultivate in them good morals such as mutual love, caring for the collective, and loving the motherland. Families, schools, and the entire society should love and educate children, do practical things for children, set examples for children, and party committees and governments at all levels should attach importance to the work of optimal birth, upbringing, and education. Medical, commercial, and production departments should pay attention to the health and hygiene of infants, young children, children, and adolescents, and focus on the research and production of children's food, toys, and daily necessities; educational departments should seriously implement the Compulsory Education Law, and cultural and propaganda departments should strive to provide children and adolescents with excellent spiritual nourishment, providing children with books, periodicals, audio-visual products, and toys that are both content-rich and healthy. All levels of government must strictly control and resolutely stop any behavior that abuses children and adolescents and infringes upon their legal rights. Serious cases should be punished according to law. The entire society must resolutely fight against such bad phenomena.

Comrades, the tasks of optimal birth, upbringing, and education are heavy, and there are many difficulties. The State Council has decided to establish a leading group for the unified coordination of women and children's work, inviting leaders and experts from various relevant departments to participate, to strengthen the leadership and guidance of this work. Party committees and governments at all levels, every family, and the entire society should work together, each doing their part, and each performing their duties. I believe that our work on optimal birth, upbringing, and education will definitely achieve greater success.

Thank you all. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全社会都来关心下一代的健康成长
    ——在全国优生、优育、优教讨论会上的讲话
    李　鹏
    一九八九年九月六日同志们：
    在今年教师节即将来临之际，全国妇联和全国儿童少年工作协调委员会召开“优生、优育、优教讨论会”，是件很有意义的事情。我今天来参加这个会议很高兴。下面我谈几点意见，以表达党中央和国务院对这项工作的关怀和重视。
    儿童少年是我们中华民族的希望和未来。要把我国由一个人口众多的发展中的国家建设成为繁荣富强的社会主义现代化强国，不仅需要当代人的艰苦创业，而且需要几代人坚持不懈的奋斗。提倡优生、优育、优教，目的就在于创造必要的条件，把我们的新一代人培养成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的人。这是提高民族素质的需要，社会主义祖国兴旺发达的需要。现在的孩子，再过几年、十几年、二十几年，就要走向社会，投入社会主义建设事业的各条战线。可以预料，到二十一世纪初叶，历史的重任将必然地落在新一代人的肩上。因此，全面研讨探索在新的形势下如何能更好地加强儿童少年工作，是具有战略意义的一件大事，应该引起各级党委和政府的重视，应该得到全社会的支持！
    研究优生、优育、优教就是从生育、抚育、教育三个方面研讨对婴、幼、儿童、少年的培育工作。这是一项跨学科跨部门的综合性事业，是前人还没有深入掌握的一门学科。解放以来，在党和政府的亲切关怀下，我国消灭了许多幼儿传染流行性疾病，婴儿死亡率大幅度减少，人民生活水平有了提高，大多数儿童少年正在茁壮地成长。但是在我国，优生、优育、优教工作还有许多问题和薄弱环节，抓紧研讨，制定有关政策是十分必要的，也是十分紧迫的。
    对“婴、幼、童、少”的培育工作是一件与广大人民利益紧密相关的涉及千家万户的社会的事业。要针对生育、抚育、教育中的陈旧观念，开展科学知识的宣传教育，使广大人民群众逐步树立优生观念，掌握优育的方法，端正教育思想。家长、幼儿园、学校，除了要保证孩子们的身体健康，使他们得到正常发育之外，还要特别注重培养孩子们良好的品德和行为习惯。从幼儿开始就要根据他们的特点，开展知识的、文化的、思想品德的教育。在我国，独生子女多，如何开展对他们的教育，是摆在广大幼教工作者面前的一个新的课题。家长、老师要爱护他们，关心他们的成长。但是，不可溺爱，更不能纵容。从小就要培养他们友爱互助、爱护集体、热爱祖国的良好品德。家庭、学校和全社会都要爱护儿童，教育儿童，为儿童办实事，为儿童作表率，各级党委、政府要重视优生、优育、优教的工作。医药、商业、生产部门要注意婴、幼、儿童、少年卫生保健，重视儿童食品、玩具、日常用品的研究和生产；教育部门要认真贯彻《义务教育法》，文艺宣传部门，要努力为儿童少年提供优秀的精神食粮，提供孩子们喜欢的内容健康的图书、报刊、音像制品和玩具。对一切虐待儿童少年的行为和侵害他们合法权益的各种现象，各级政府必须严加管束，坚决制止。情节严重的要依法惩处。全社会都要和这种不良现象做坚决斗争。
    同志们，优生、优育、优教工作任务很重，困难也不少。国务院已决定建立一个统一协调妇女儿童工作的领导小组，吸收各有关方面的领导和专家参加，以加强对这项工作的领导和指导。各级党委和政府每个家庭乃至全社会都要齐心协力，各尽其力，各司其职，共同奋斗。我相信，我们的优生、优育、优教工作一定能取得更大的成绩。
    谢谢大家。　（新华社发）
