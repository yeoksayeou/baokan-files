		The People's Bank of China recently announced that the value-added interest rate for the fourth quarter is 8.36%, a reduction of 5.28 percentage points from the previous quarter. Some people are puzzled by the sudden drop in the interest rate. Yu Nai Dong, Director of the Comprehensive Planning Department of the People's Bank of China, answered questions from a reporter on this issue.

		Yu Nai Dong said, the reduction in the value-added interest rate indicates that prices have been effectively controlled, and the rectification and adjustment policies have shown initial results. This is good news for both the country and the depositors. The purpose of the bank in offering value-added savings is to attract urban and rural residents to deposit their money by offering high interest rates, thus protecting the long-term deposits of depositors from depreciation. The value-added interest rate fluctuates up and down according to changes in the price index. When the price increase is rapid, the value-added interest rate is high. When the price increase slows down, the value-added interest rate also gradually decreases. When the price index averages 3 years below the bank's 3-year term savings deposit annual interest rate, the value-added savings will naturally disappear.

		The bank's value-added savings have been well received by the masses. Since the fourth quarter of last year, savings deposits have been increasing month by month. From January to August this year, urban and rural residents' savings deposits increased by 91.15 billion yuan, equivalent to twice the increase in the same period last year.

		The reporter mentioned that the maturity dates of deposits at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter are close, but the interest rates enjoyed differ by 5.28 percentage points. Some depositors with 3-year or more term deposits maturing in the fourth quarter feel they are at a disadvantage.

		Yu Nai Dong said, according to the requirement that value-added savings are linked to prices, using the "daily" or "monthly" price index is more reasonable, so that the dynamic changes in prices can be reflected in a timely manner. However, there are difficulties in the current statistical methods, and the value-added interest rate can only be announced quarterly. Therefore, within a quarter, regardless of the day of maturity, the compensation rate is given according to one compensation rate.

		In order to make the price index linked to value-added savings closer to reality, the People's Bank of China has consulted with the National Bureau of Statistics and is striving to start using the current quarterly average price index as the monthly average price index from next January, so that the compensation rate can be more reasonably adjusted with the fluctuation of prices.

    物价涨势趋缓　保值贴补应降
    人民银行有关负责人就保值储蓄贴补率答记者问
    本报北京9月25日讯　记者施明慎报道：9月23日人民银行公布第四季度保值储蓄年补贴率为8.36％，比上季度降低5.28个百分点，一些群众对贴补率陡然下降感到疑惑不解。中国人民银行综合计划司司长于耐冬就此回答了记者的提问。
    于耐冬说，保值储蓄贴补率的降低，表明物价得到了有效控制，治理整顿方针初见成效，对国家和储户都是可喜的信息。银行开办保值储蓄的目的，就是用高息吸收城乡居民存款，以保护储户在银行的长期存款不受贬值损失。保值储蓄贴补率是根据物价指数变化而上下浮动的。物价上涨幅度猛，保值储蓄贴补率就高。物价上升幅度减缓，保值储蓄贴补率也逐渐降低。当物价指数平均3年都在银行3年期储蓄存款年利率以下时，保值储蓄就自然消失。
    银行开办保值储蓄受到广大群众的欢迎。自去年第四季度以来，储蓄存款逐月增加。今年1至8月，城乡居民储蓄存款增加911.5亿元，相当于去年同期增加额的两倍。
    记者谈到，今年第三季度末和第四季度初存款到期的时间相近，而享受的贴补率却相差5.28个百分点，一些有3年期以上存款在第四季度到期的储户觉得有些吃亏。
    对此，于耐冬说，按照保值储蓄与物价挂钩的要求，运用“日”或“月”价格指数较合理，物价渐变的动态就能及时反映出来。但是目前的统计手段存在困难，保值储蓄贴补率只能按季公布。因此在一个季度内不管哪一天到期都按一个贴补率给予补贴。
    为了使与保值储蓄挂钩的物价指数接近实际，人民银行已和国家统计局协商，争取明年1月开始，把现行的按季平均的价格指数为月平均价格指数，使贴补率随物价浮动趋向合理。
