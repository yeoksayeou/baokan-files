With the development of the commodity economy, the number of individual households earning tens of thousands of yuan is increasing. However, there are not many individual accounts with deposits of more than ten thousand yuan in the banks. Where did the money of these individual households go? The investigation results are worrying:

	Hot consumption. The investigation shows that the money earned by individual households, apart from a portion used to expand operations, is mostly used for housing construction and high consumption, purchasing high-end consumer goods such as color TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines. More notably, some individual households do not hesitate to spend heavily, competing with each other. New houses and small villas are springing up, with some designs so intricate and decorations so luxurious that they are astonishing.

	“External circulation.” Due to the reform of settlement methods that still cannot meet the needs of individual households for commodity transactions, the phenomenon of large amounts of funds “externally circulating” is very common. A prominent manifestation is that some individual households, in order to purchase materials and goods, carry large sums of money and travel everywhere, with some even hiring bodyguards. According to a sample survey, this part of the “externally circulating” funds accounts for 20-40% of the total operating funds of individual households.

	Lending at high interest rates. As the commodity economy develops, capital becomes more active, especially in today's environment where banks are tightening credit. Therefore, some individual households who have made a lot of money disregard national financial regulations and engage in private lending activities, with interest rates far exceeding bank lending rates. Some state-owned enterprises, in extreme financial difficulties, also choose the path of borrowing high-interest loans from individuals.

	Holding cash for purchases. Unstable prices cause some individual households to fear inflation, believing that “saving money is not as good as saving goods.” Whenever there is a fluctuation in prices or a shortage of goods in the market, they rush to buy and hoard goods, speculating and reselling.

	Saving for old age. Individual households do not have an “iron rice bowl,” so they think about their future and save part of their surplus money. Some deposit it in the bank, while others hide it in various places.

    个体户手中的票子哪里去了
    随着商品经济的发展，收入在数万元以上的个体户日益增多。然而在银行的储蓄帐目上，并未发现多少单户存款在万元以上的。这些个体户的票子哪里去了？调查结果令人担忧：
    热衷消费。调查表明，个体户挣得的钱除一部分用于扩大经营外，大部分用于房屋建设和高消费，购置彩电、冰箱、洗衣机等高档消费品。更突出的是，一些个体户不惜重金，相互攀比，新房、小洋楼拔地而起，有的设计之精巧，装璜之豪华令人咋舌。
      “体外循环”。由于结算方式的改革仍不能适应个体户进行商品交易的需要，资金大量“体外循环”的现象非常普遍。突出的表现是一些个体户为了采购物资、商品等，腰缠万贯，四处奔波，有的还随身雇用了保镖。据抽样调查统计，这部分“体外循环”的资金占到个体户全部经营资金的20—40％。
    放高利贷。商品经济越发展，资金就越活跃，特别在银行紧缩银根的今天，个体户向银行贷款的渠道基本上被堵死。因此，一些发了大财的个体户竟置国家金融法规于不顾，私下进行借贷活动，其利率远远高出银行贷款利率。个别国营企业在资金极度困难中也选择了向私人借高利贷这一途径。
    持币待购。物价不稳造成一些个体户对通货膨胀的恐慌心理，“存钱不如存物”，一遇物价波动或市场上出现紧俏商品时，他们便蜂拥抢购，囤积居奇，转手倒卖。
    积蓄养老。个体户没有“铁饭碗”，为自己的后路着想，把节余的一部分钱积蓄起来。有的存入银行，有的则东藏西塞。
