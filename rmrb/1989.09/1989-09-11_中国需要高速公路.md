The question of whether China needs to build high-speed roads has been debated for many years. Some advocate for the construction of high-speed roads, while others oppose it. Opponents argue that building high-speed roads requires more money and land, which is not suitable for China's national conditions. They believe that high-speed roads are for small cars, and since China has fewer small cars compared to foreign countries, there is no need to build high-speed roads.

In fact, high-speed roads have many functions, and their social and economic benefits are very high. Although the land and construction costs per kilometer of high-speed roads are higher than those of ordinary roads, the land and costs required to complete a unit turnover are much less. A four-lane high-speed road has a traffic capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day and night. In countries with high traffic density, the traffic capacity of a four-lane high-speed road can reach 70,000 to 80,000 vehicles. Assuming an equal number of passenger and freight vehicles, if each freight vehicle carries 5 tons, the annual capacity would be 4,500 million to 6,300 million tons; if each vehicle carries 10 tons, the annual capacity would be 9,000 million to 12,000 million tons. If each passenger vehicle carries 30 people, the annual capacity would be 130 million passengers. Because it is fully interchanged and fully enclosed, vehicles travel in designated lanes, eliminating longitudinal and transverse interference, and solving the problem of mixed traffic. Therefore, the driving speed is fast, which can maximize the prevention of traffic congestion and reduce traffic accidents. Since its appearance in the world, it has developed with a strong vitality. Currently, there are approximately 130,000 kilometers of high-speed roads worldwide. In terms of the total road mileage, it occupies a small proportion, but it undertakes a large transportation task. For example, Japan's high-speed roads account for only 0.28% of the national road mileage but handle 6% of the national vehicle traffic volume, 10.4% of the national freight turnover volume, and 25.6% of the national road freight turnover volume.

Some people say that only when the per capita income level reaches $1,000 can high-speed roads be built. This argument is incorrect. The basic basis for building high-speed roads is traffic volume, not per capita income. Many countries in the world stipulate that when the daily traffic volume of a road reaches 10,000 vehicles, a high-speed road should be built. China's "Road Engineering Technical Standards" stipulate that when the daily number of small cars reaches 25,000 vehicles (equivalent to 12,500 standard loaded vehicles), a high-speed road should be built. When considering whether to build a high-speed road, a feasibility study should be conducted first, and the payback period of the construction investment should be calculated. Currently, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, Guangzhou-Foshan, and Shenyang-Dalian high-speed roads under construction have all undergone several years, even more than ten years, of investigation and research, and have been decided after expert evaluation and discussion. From many foreign materials and examples, it can be seen that after the construction and development of high-speed roads, the automobile industry can be promoted, the national gross domestic product can be increased, and the per capita income level can be improved.

Currently, China has fewer small cars, but this does not mean that China will not develop small cars, nor does it mean that because there are fewer small cars, there is no need to develop high-speed roads. High-speed roads are not just for small cars. This is the case in countries around the world, and it is also the case in China. High-speed roads are the highest grade roads with the largest traffic capacity. In the process of vigorously developing road construction, it is necessary to plan and gradually build some necessary high-speed roads. This is not only a need for the development of roads themselves but also an important aspect of solving the tight situation of railways. With the further deepening of economic reform, the demand for road transportation will continue to increase, and the development of high-speed roads is inevitable. China needs high-speed roads.

　　中国需要高速公路

    在中国是否需要修高速公路的问题，已经争论好多年了。有人主张修高速公路，也有人反对修高速公路。反对者的理由是修高速公路要多花钱、多占地，不适合我国国情。他们认为高速公路是供小汽车用的，外国小汽车多，我国小汽车少，没有必要修高速公路。
    其实，高速公路有很多功能，它的社会效益和经济效益都是很高的。虽然每公里高速公路占地和造价比一般公路高，但完成单位周转量所需土地与造价则比一般公路要少得多。一条四车道的高速公路，每昼夜的交通容量（汽车通行量）为5万车次，国外行车密度大的四车道高速公路，其交通容量已达7到8万车次，以客货车各占一半估计，货车若以5吨计，每年则可承运4500万吨到6300万吨；若以10吨计，每年则可承运9000万吨到1.2亿吨；客车以每辆乘坐30人计，每年则可承运1.3亿人次。由于它是全立交、全封闭，汽车实行分向分道行驶，排除了纵向与横向干挠，解决了混合交通问题，因此行车速度快，能最大限度地防止交通阻塞和减少交通事故。所以自从它在世界上一出现，就以强大的生命力在发展前进。目前世界上大约已建成高速公路13万多公里，从公路的总里程来说，它占的比例是很小的，但它承担着很大的运输任务。如日本的高速公路仅占全国公路总里程的0.28％，却承担了全国汽车交通量的6％，承担全国货运周转量的10.4％，占全国公路货运周转量的25.6％。
    有人说，只有人均收入水平达到一千美元以上，才能修建高速公路。这个论点是不对的。修建高速公路的基本依据是交通量而不是人均收入。世界上许多国家规定，当一条公路的日交通量达到一万车次以上，就需要修建高速公路。我国的《公路工程技术标准》规定，小汽车的日行车数量达到25000车次（折合标准载重汽车12500车次）的时候，则需要修建高速公路。当考虑是否修建一条高速公路的时候，首先要进行可行性研究，要计算出建设投资的偿还期。目前正在施工的京津塘高速公路、广州到佛山的高速公路、沈阳到大连的高速公路等都是经过好几年，甚至十几年调查研究，经过专家评议论证后才决定的。从国外许多资料和实例来看，高速公路建设和发展起来以后，可以促进汽车工业的发展，促进国民生产总值的增加并提高人均收入水平。
    我国目前状况是小汽车少，但并不能由此推断我国就不会发展小汽车，更不能说因为小汽车少就无需发展高速公路。高速公路不仅仅是为小汽车服务的。世界各国如此，中国也是如此。高速公路是高等级公路中通行能力最大的等级公路，在大力发展公路建设中，应有计划地逐步建设一些必要的高速公路。这不仅是公路发展本身的需要，而且也是解决铁路紧张局面的重要方面。随着经济改革的进一步深化，公路运输的需求将不断增加，发展高速公路势在必行，中国需要高速公路。
