People often use phrases like “the sky has no three days of clear weather, the land has no three feet of flat ground, and people have no three ounces of silver” to describe the backwardness of Guizhou in the past. In reality, the true backwardness of Guizhou lies in the farthest region from the provincial capital, known as the "gap between Guizhou, Hubei, and Sichuan" — Songtao. "Leaving home means entering the mountains, mountains without end. Singing across the mountains, meeting takes three days." Not only was it backward, but it was also isolated. In the long river of history, people could not see the waves of Songjiang River carrying the spirit of the Miao mountains, and the outside world did not know that there was a place called Songtao in the world.

For decades, hundreds of thousands of Miao people and other ethnic minorities lived on this 2,866-square-kilometer piece of land, singing to each other across the mountains and working hard to make a living. Very few people had ever left the mountains or ventured beyond the water forts. Later, a few young people who were not content with their fate decided to take their singing beyond the mountains. They paddled wooden rafts down the Songjiang River, through Dongting Lake to Changde, exchanging barrels of tung oil and baskets of white rice for items called "foreign matches, foreign oil, foreign cloth, foreign nails, foreign iron, foreign paint." Even now, some old women still can't change their habits, always calling soap "foreign alkali."

After liberation, the Miao people had new aspirations, wanting to produce some "foreign goods" themselves. By 1952, Songtao finally had a record of "three weaving factories, with a production value of 4,000 yuan." However, the true transformation of Miao villages began after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The spring breeze of reform and opening up reached the remote mountain areas, and the Miao people had new aspirations.

Everyone clearly saw that information blockades, lack of talent, insufficient funds, and weak technology were the main obstacles to the development of the Miao villages. The county party committee and government, in accordance with the wishes of the Miao people, decided to open the mountain gates, actively develop horizontal economic cooperation, and with the spirit of "not fearing personal loss and seeking common development," take the path of "borrowing chickens to lay eggs, borrowing strength to climb mountains, and borrowing wind to sail ships." They chose to develop manganese and peanut products as the breakthrough, adopting flexible, diverse, and preferential methods to gradually extend their reach across the country, using sincerity to attract the "worker elder brothers" and "expert uncles" from Guiyang, the provincial capital, and from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to the stage of developing and revitalizing Songtao. Over the years, they have introduced 49 talents, 48 advanced technology projects, 45 sets (units) of advanced equipment, 1,000 tons of materials, and 30 million yuan in funds. They have established 38 information contact points outside the county, obtained more than 1,900 useful pieces of information, and newly built, renovated, and expanded 33 development projects. The development stage has both duets and choruses, both small and large ensembles. The county battery factory, established in 1975, was always in the red and on the verge of closure. The county party committee and government actively played the role of matchmaker, enthusiastically arranging introductions, and in 1985, it formed a good partnership with the Guiyang Battery Factory, singing in harmony and stepping in unison. That year, it turned losses into profits, and so far, it has created a production value of nearly 10 million yuan, realizing taxes and profits of more than 2 million yuan, becoming an advanced enterprise in Guizhou Province. The manganese mine hidden deep in the Wuling Mountains, through cooperation, Beijing provided funds, Hunan provided equipment, Guiyang provided projects, and Zunyi provided technical talent. It has developed from a small enterprise that could only produce a single type of battery industry manganese powder in its early days into a large enterprise that can mass-produce various manganese products for metallurgy, chemical industry, and military industry, with an annual production value of 3.6 million yuan and taxes and profits of 2.8 million yuan.

For a long time, various enterprises in Songtao, due to weak technical strength and low worker quality, could only achieve limited benefits. After implementing horizontal economic cooperation, these enterprises underwent technological innovation and transformation, training more than 5,000 workers, continuously improving the product technology and management level of these enterprises, and forming a production capacity and market. Now, the county has produced 41 types of famous, superior, special, and new products, of which 12 have won awards at the national, provincial, and regional levels. Seven manganese series products and 16 peanut series products have increasing fame in the provincial and national markets, with high demand. Roasted manganese, manganese carbonate, manganese dioxide, and sintered manganese products have become hot commodities in the competitive manganese product market, selling well in 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

Songtao electrolytic manganese is also highly sought after. After its products crossed the East China Sea to Japan, they were also exported to the United States, France, Italy, and the Federal Republic of Germany, earning 700,000 US dollars in foreign exchange. The Miao ethnic handicrafts, which won the special prize for youth scientific and technological achievements in Guizhou Province in 1987, also began their journey across the ocean.

Over the years, the county's joint ventures have increased production value by nearly 30 million yuan. In 1988, industrial production value was 2.5 times that of 1980, and profits doubled. The development of joint ventures has injected new vitality into the ethnic economy. In 1988, fiscal revenue was 2.65 times that of 1980; people's lives have continuously improved, and in 1988, the per capita income of the entire county was 3.4 times that of 1980. The "performing together on stage" approach of Songtao has been affirmed by higher authorities. In January 1988, it was evaluated as an advanced unit for horizontal economic cooperation in the Tongren region.

The waters of the Songjiang River flow into Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River, merging into the tide of the times. "The road of reform is wide and spacious, the play of reform is lively. Looking at the good scenery outside the mountains, the song flies out of the heart." The songs and fame of the Miao people spread beyond the mountains.

### 从隔山对歌到同台唱戏

　　从隔山对歌到同台唱戏
　　龙益飞（苗族）
    人们常用“天无三日晴、地无三尺平、人无三分银”这样的语言来形容昔日贵州的落后。其实，黔中真正落后的是离省城最远、被称为“黔与楚蜀之隙地”的松桃。“出门就是山，山连没有边。隔山把歌对，见面要三天。”不仅落后，而且闭塞，在万流汇聚的历史长河中，人们看不到带着苗山魂的松江河奔去的浪花，外面的世界也不知道尘寰中还有松桃其地。
    几十万苗族和其他各民族同胞在这块2866平方公里的土地上对歌传情、劳作生息，极少有人出过山门、闯过水寨。后来，少数不甘寂寞胆大一点的年轻人决定把歌对到山外去，于是撑着木排顺着松江，下洞庭、流常德，用一桶桶桐油、一箩箩白米换回一些叫做“洋火、洋油、洋布、洋钉、洋铁、洋漆”的东西，直到如今一些老阿婆还改不过口，总把肥皂叫“洋碱”。
    解放后，苗族同胞有了新的追求，想自己也造点“洋货”出来。到1952年，松桃终于有了“3个织布厂、产值4000元”的记载。然而，苗乡面貌真正发生变化，是在党的十一届三中全会后。改革开放的春风吹到边远山区，苗乡人民又有了新的追求。
    大家清楚地看到：信息闭塞、人才缺乏、资金不足、技术薄弱，成了苗乡发展的主要障碍。县委、县政府按照苗乡人民的愿望，从本县具有锰矿、铅锌矿和花生、民间工艺品等丰富资源的实际出发，决定敞开山门，积极发展横向经济联合，以“不怕自己吃亏、寻求共同发展”的精神风貌，走“借鸡生蛋、借力爬山、借风行船”的路子，以开发锰矿、花生两大系列产品为突破口，采取优惠、灵活、多样的方式，把触角逐渐伸向全国各地，用真诚把省城贵阳和京、津、沪、川、湘、鄂、浙、赣、粤等地的“工人老大哥”和“专家老表”吸引到开发和振兴松桃的舞台上。几年来，共引进各类人才49人，引进先进技术项目48个、先进设备45套（台）、引进物资1000多万吨，引进资金3000多万元，建立县外信息联系点38个、获取各种有用信息1900多条，新建、改建、扩建开发项目33项。开发的舞台，既有二重唱，又有齐唱、合唱、大合唱。县电池厂1975年建立后年年亏损，濒临倒闭。县委、县政府主动当“红娘”，热情牵线搭桥，1985年与贵阳电池厂喜结良缘，唱同调行同步，当年就扭亏为盈，到目前为止创产值已近1000万元，实现利税200多万元，成为贵州省的先进企业。藏在武陵山深处密林中的锰矿，通过联合，北京送来资金、湖南送来设备、贵阳送来项目、遵义送来技术人才，现已由建厂初期只能生产单一的电池工业用矿粉的小型企业，发展成为能大量成批生产冶金、化工、军工等多种锰矿产品，年产值360多万元、利税280多万元的大型企业。
    长期以来，松桃各类企业由于技术力量薄弱、职工素质较差，所能发挥的效益十分有限。实行横向经济联合后，对这些企业进行了技术革新和技术改造，培训职工5000多人次，使这些企业的产品工艺技术和管理水平不断提高，并有了定型产品、形成了生产能力、打开了市场。现在，全县已生产出名优特新产品41种，其中12种分别先后在国家、省、地区获奖，7种锰系列产品和16种花生系列产品在省内外市场声誉日增，供不应求。焙烧锰、碳酸锰、氧化锰、烧结锰等产品在强手如林的锰产品市场竞争中成为热门货，畅销全国20个省、区和直辖市。
    松桃电解锰更是备受青睐，产品东渡扶桑后，又远销美国、法国、意大利和联邦德国等地，已创汇70多万美元。曾获得贵州省1987年度青年科技成果特等奖的苗族工艺品，也开始了远渡重洋的历史。
    几年来，全县因为联营新增产值近3000万元，1988年工业产值比1980年增长了2.5倍，利润翻了两番。
    联营的发展，给民族经济注入了新的活力，1988年财政收入是1980年的2.65倍；人民生活不断改善，1988年全县人均收入比1980年增长3.4倍。松桃“同台唱戏”的作法，受到了上级的肯定，1988年元月被评为铜仁地区横向经济联合先进单位。
    松江河水流洞庭、入长江，汇进了时代潮流。“改革大路宽宽阔，改革大戏热闹闹。放眼山外好风景，歌声飞出心窝窝。”苗乡人的歌声和名声一起传到山外。
