The once desolate, isolated, and backward ethnic minority regions of our country have undergone a dramatic transformation. Over the past 40 years, the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased by 21 times, and the 55 ethnic minorities are living stable and happy lives in the socialist family.

China is a multi-ethnic country. By the end of 1988, there were more than 720 ethnic autonomous regions at the county level and above, with a population of over 60 million. After liberation, these ethnic minority regions broke free from the shackles of slavery and feudalism, skipping one or several stages of social development, and directly transitioning to socialism. Economic construction has achieved unprecedented development. The total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 3.66 billion yuan in 1949 to 109.2 billion yuan in 1988. These regions, which were traditionally dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry, have seen the rise of modern industry. The total industrial output value reached 68.6 billion yuan, an increase of 123 times compared to before liberation. Industrial output value has significantly surpassed agricultural output value, indicating that economic construction in ethnic minority regions is moving towards modernization. A number of new towns have become the economic and cultural centers of ethnic regions.

According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, over the past 40 years, the total investment in basic construction in ethnic minority regions has reached 141.7 billion yuan, establishing 37,000 industrial and mining enterprises. The Baotou Steel Industrial Base, the Kela Mayi Oil Industrial Base, and the Helan Mountain Coal Industrial Base have become important components of the country's modern industry, providing a large amount of raw materials, fuel, and power for national construction. Steel production has increased from zero to 2.91 million tons; coal production has exceeded 100 million tons, accounting for 1/10 of the national production. Ethnic minority residents have bid farewell to the history of using kerosene for lighting, with electricity generation reaching 55.3 billion kilowatt-hours, 692 times that of 1952.

The ethnic minority regions on the border of the motherland were once isolated from the world. Now, 12,700 kilometers of railways and 277,000 kilometers of highways have been built. The People's Liberation Army and local residents have opened up the Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and Xinjiang-Tibet highways on the roof of the world, fundamentally changing the history of transportation by human and animal carriers in Tibet and Qinghai. In the "no-fly zone" of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, air routes to domestic and international destinations have been opened.

Traditional agriculture and animal husbandry in ethnic minority regions have further developed. Water conservancy facilities have been continuously improved, and the irrigated area has doubled; ancient extensive farming methods have begun to be replaced by scientific farming; primitive simple farming tools have started to be replaced by mechanized and semi-mechanized tools. The total agricultural output value has increased by 6 times over the past 40 years, grain production has increased by 1.8 times, and cotton production has increased by 8 times. The vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where "the wind blows low and the cattle and sheep are visible," produce a large number of live cattle, sheep, and fur products every year, which are sold domestically and internationally, making it an important base for animal husbandry and the production of wool, dairy, and related products in China.

The living standards of residents in ethnic minority regions have improved, moving from poverty to a level of basic subsistence, and even towards a moderately prosperous society. In 1988, the total retail sales of social consumer goods in these regions reached 68.2 billion yuan, an increase of 17 times compared to 1952. Televisions, audio recorders, cameras, sewing machines, bicycles, and other modern mid-to-high-end consumer goods are popular in local markets. Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, the income of ethnic minority households has increased rapidly. The per capita income of Tibetan farmers and herders has doubled, and the per capita income of Inner Mongolian herders has reached 850 yuan. Every 10 herder households own 4 televisions and 5 audio recorders.

　　经济建设发展迅速　人民生活安定幸福
　　少数民族地区旧貌变新颜
　　工农业总产值40年增长21倍
    新华社北京9月10日电　（记者吴士深）昔日荒凉、闭塞、落后的我国少数民族地区如今“换了人间”，工农业总产值40年间增长21倍，55个少数民族在社会主义大家庭中过着安定而幸福的生活。
    我国是一个多民族国家，截至1988年底，全国共建立县以上少数民族自治地方720多个，居住人员6000多万。少数民族地区解放后摆脱奴隶制度、封建制度的束缚，超越一个或几个社会发展阶段，直接过渡到社会主义，经济建设获得前所未有的发展。工农业总产值从1949年的36.6亿元发展到1988年的1092亿元。这些历来以农牧业为主的地方如今现代工业崛起，工业总产值达到686亿元，比解放前增长123倍。工业产值已经明显超过农业产值。这表明少数民族地区的经济建设正向现代化发展。一批新兴的城镇已成为民族地区的经济和文化中心。
    据国家统计局统计，40年来，少数民族地区基本建设投资总额达1417亿元，建立起了3.7万个工矿企业。包头钢铁工业基地、克拉玛依石油工业基地、贺兰山煤炭工业基地等已成为国家现代化工业的重要组成部分，为国家建设提供了大量的原料、燃料和动力。钢铁产量从无到有，达到291万吨；原煤产量突破1亿吨，占全国产量1／10强；少数民族居民家庭纷纷告别煤油点灯照明的历史，发电量已达553亿千瓦小时，是1952年的692倍。
    地处祖国边陲的少数民族地区过去大都交通闭塞，甚至与世隔离。现在已经建起了1.27万公里铁路和27.7万公里公路。人民解放军和当地居民劈山越水，在世界屋脊上开辟了青藏、川藏和新藏公路，从根本上改变了西藏青海“艰险羊肠道，溜索独木桥”，人背畜驮的运输历史。在被称“空中禁区”的青藏高原还开辟了通向国内国际的航线。
    少数民族地区传统的农牧业获得进一步发展。水利设施不断充实，灌溉面积扩大一倍；古老的粗放耕作方法开始被科学种田所取代；原始的简单农具开始被机械化、半机械化农具所更替。农业总产值40年间增长6倍，粮食产量增长1.8倍，棉花产量增长8倍。“风吹草低见牛羊”的内蒙古草原每年有大量活牛、活羊和毛皮等畜产品销往国内外，成为我国重要的畜牧业基地和畜产品和毛纺、乳品生产基地。
    少数民族地区居民生活摆脱贫困，开始向温饱型，甚至小康型迈进。1988年这些地区社会商品零售总额682亿元，比1952年增长17倍。电视机、录音机、照相机、缝纫机、自行车等现代化的中高档消费品是当地市场上的畅销货。改革开放10年间，少数民族居民家庭收入增长尤快，西藏农牧民人均收入增加两倍，内蒙古牧民人均收入高达850元，每10户牧民家庭拥有4台电视机和5台收录机。
