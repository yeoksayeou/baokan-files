Since September 27, 1987, Lhasa has experienced more than a dozen disturbances. A few separatist elements, using the pretext of "religion" and "human rights," have been shouting for "Tibet independence" and engaging in rampant acts of arson, looting, and vandalism, which have had varying degrees of impact and destruction on Tibet's various construction projects. For this reason, on March 8 of this year, the State Council issued an order to impose martial law in the urban area of Lhasa.

How should we view the recent disturbances in Lhasa? Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Apho Awanjinmei, shared his views.

Vice Chairman Apho said that the Lhasa disturbances were neither a national issue nor a religious issue, and certainly not a human rights issue. Fundamentally, they were criminal acts of a few separatist elements, both domestic and foreign, who, with the support and instigation of certain hostile forces, deliberately created disturbances to split the motherland. Tibet is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. We must warn those with ulterior motives: any attempt to internationalize the Tibet issue is futile and will not be tolerated by the Chinese government.

Apho said that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Government has implemented flexible and special economic policies in Tibet, implemented a series of policies to promote economic and cultural development, improve people's lives, respect religious beliefs and freedom, and respect national customs and habits, and further implement regional ethnic autonomy. Practice has proven that these policies are in line with Tibet's actual situation.

Regarding the martial law in Lhasa, he said that the State Council's martial law order is firmly supported by the people of Tibet and is a necessary measure to protect the lives and property of the people and to punish a few separatist elements.

In response to the Central Government's policy towards the Dalai Lama, who is in exile abroad, Apho Awanjinmei said that the Central Government's policy and stance have been consistent. The door for negotiations with the Dalai Lama has always been open and has never been closed. However, negotiations have not yet been successful due to three main obstacles: first, the Central Government will not negotiate with representatives from the so-called "exile government," which has never been recognized; second, negotiations with the Dalai Lama are an internal affair of China and do not allow any foreign interference or involvement; third, the Dalai Lama has not yet sent a representative who can truly represent his personal views to negotiate with the Central Government.

Vice Chairman Apho said that since the Yuan Dynasty, Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibetan people are members of the Chinese nation. We must safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of the national family, and oppose any attempt to pursue "Tibet independence." Our struggle against a few stubborn separatist elements who insist on "Tibet independence" has occurred in the past, is occurring now, and will continue to occur in the future.

　　搞“西藏独立”不得人心
　　——阿沛副委员长谈西藏问题
    自1987年9月27日以来，拉萨连续发生了十几次骚乱事件，少数分裂主义分子打着“宗教”、“人权”的幌子，叫嚣“西藏独立”，疯狂进行打砸抢烧，给西藏的各项建设事业造成了不同程度的影响和破坏。为此，今年3月8日国务院发布了在拉萨市区实行戒严的命令。
    如何看待拉萨前一段出现的骚乱事件？全国人大常委会副委员长、西藏自治区人大常委会主任阿沛·阿旺晋美阐述了自己的见解。
    阿沛副委员长说，拉萨骚乱，既不是民族问题或宗教问题，更不是人权问题；从根本上说，是国内外极少数分裂主义分子在某些敌对势力的支持和挑动下，蓄意制造的分裂祖国的犯罪行为。西藏是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分。我们要正告那些居心叵测的人：任何想使西藏问题国际化的企图都是徒劳的，是我国政府所不能容忍的。
    阿沛说，党的十一届三中全会以来，中央对西藏实行了灵活、特殊的经济政策，落实了一系列促进经济、文化发展，改善人民生活，尊重宗教信仰自由和民族风俗习惯的政策，进一步实行民族区域自治，实践证明是切合西藏实际的。
    谈到拉萨戒严，他说，国务院的戒严令是西藏人民坚决拥护的，是为保护人民生命财产、惩处少数分裂主义分子不得不采取的措施。
    在回答中央对流亡国外的达赖的政策时，阿沛·阿旺晋美说，中央的政策和立场是一贯的，对达赖喇嘛谈判的门始终是敞开着的，从来没有关过。但至今没谈成，主要有3个障碍：第一，中央政府是不会跟从未被承认的“流亡政府”成员组成的代表团谈判的；第二，跟达赖喇嘛谈判是我国内部事务，不容许任何外国人插手或参与此事；第三，达赖喇嘛至今还未派出真正能代表他个人意见的代表来跟中央谈。
    阿沛副委员长说，西藏自元代以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，藏族是中华民族的一员。我们要维护祖国的统一和民族大家庭的团结，反对任何搞“西藏独立”的企图。我们与极少数顽固坚持“西藏独立”的分裂主义分子的斗争，过去有，现在有，将来还会有。
