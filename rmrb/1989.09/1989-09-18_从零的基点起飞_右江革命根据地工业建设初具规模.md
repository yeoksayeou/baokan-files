Zero signifies a blank slate. Over the past 40 years since liberation, the industrial construction of the Right River revolutionary old area has rapidly developed from zero.

The Right River revolutionary base is where the Red Seventh Army, led by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Deng Xiaoping, fought and shed blood. Before liberation, the Right River area was plagued by poor transportation, lack of information, and political darkness, which resulted in a highly backward economy. The heavy and light industries in the Baise region were virtually non-existent!

The birth of New China marked the end of the industrial blank period in the Right River area. The state has cumulatively invested 7.5 billion yuan in fixed industrial assets in the Baise region, and in the past decade of reform, an additional 4.2 billion yuan has been invested. The entire region has established black and non-ferrous metal mining, smelting, and processing industries, as well as other non-metallic mining and processing, food, textiles, papermaking, electricity, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and building materials, totaling 32 industries and 644 industrial and mining enterprises. The scale of production has continuously expanded, and the variety and quantity of products have continuously increased, initially forming an industrial network centered around the Right River basin and radiating to various counties in the Baise region. In recent years, the region has also seen the emergence of more than 20 ethnic-characteristic export-oriented enterprises, with more than 20 types of export products.

The Party Central Committee, in order to accelerate the economic development of the Right River old area, has in recent years arranged for a batch of national key projects as poverty alleviation projects to be built here: developing the Pingguo aluminum mine with a reserve of over 1 billion tons, which, upon completion, can become the largest aluminum city in southern China; developing the oil resources of the Baise basin, making it the first oil field developed among more than 100 medium and small basins in southern China; this year, the Nanning-Kunming railway has been included in the new line construction plan, with an annual investment of 1.5 billion yuan. The construction of these key projects is of great significance to the revitalization of the Right River old area and even the entire southwestern region.

The 40-year journey is one of the Right River old area's industrial development from nothing to a certain scale. By the end of 1988, the region's total industrial output value reached 5.6 billion yuan (1980 constant prices), an increase of 112 times over 1950; the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has risen from 3.3% in 1950 to 44.8%.

　　从零的基点起飞
　　右江革命根据地工业建设初具规模
    零，是空白的标志。解放40年来，右江革命老区的工业建设就是在零的基点上迅速发展的。
    右江革命根据地是邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家亲手创建和领导的红七军浴血战斗过的地方。解放前，右江一带交通不便、信息闭塞，加上政治黑暗，致使经济十分落后，百色地区的重、轻工业均为零！
    新中国的诞生结束了右江一带的工业空白史。国家先后用于百色地区工业固定资产投资累计达7.5亿元，特别在改革10年间又新投资了4.2亿元，全地区先后建起了黑色和有色金属矿的采选、冶炼和加工业，以及其他非金属矿采选加工、食品、纺织、造纸、电力、石化、医药、建筑材料等32个行业共644家工矿企业。生产规模不断扩大，产品品种和产量不断增加，初步形成了以右江盆地为中心，辐射百色地区各县的工业网络。近几年来，全地区还涌现出20多家具有民族特色的外向型企业，出口产品达20多种。
    党中央为了加快右江老区的经济开发，近几年又将国家一批重点工程作为扶贫项目，安排在这里兴建：开发储量达10亿多吨的平果铝矿，建成后可成为祖国南部最大的铝都；开发百色盆地石油资源，使之成为我国南方内陆100多个中小型盆地中第一个开发的油田；今年，又将南（宁）昆（明）铁路列入新线开工计划，年投资1.5亿元。这些重点工程的建设，对右江老区乃至大西南的振兴都具有举足轻重的意义。
    40年的历程，是右江老区工业从无到有，并初具规模的历程。1988年底，全地区工业总产值达5.6亿元（1980年不变价），比1950年增长112倍；工业总产值占工农业总产值的比重已由1950年的3.3％上升到44.8％。
