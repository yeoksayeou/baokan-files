In the development of China's music industry, the military's music construction has always held an important position. Almost every era has seen songs created by military music workers that have become popular in society; almost every major domestic music competition has seen works by military music workers winning awards. The recent celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation's military arts performance showcased the achievements of military music construction over the past few years.

The song and dance troupes of the General Political Department, Beijing Military Region, Guangzhou Military Region, Nanjing Military Region, and Shenyang Military Region have almost unanimously chosen the theme of "Guardians of the Republic." They closely follow the pulse of the times, using all artistic means to reflect the voice of the people. "Red Star Ode - The Republic Will Not Forget" is a song full of deep affection and high respect for the people's army. The author, standing at the height of the times, uses the image of the red star to summarize and depict the style and achievements of soldiers. "The Song of the Guardians of the Republic" employs various means such as solo, duet, and chorus, with an expansive and smooth melody and rapidly changing harmonies, taking the audience into a grand scene of heroic competition. Songs like "China's Land," "Following You," "Green Distant Mountains," "Tribute to the Monument to the People's Heroes," "Thinking of Him, Loving Him, Blessing Him," "Seeing Us Is Seeing China," and "Motherland, Please Inspect Us" have flowing, lively tunes that are clear and straightforward, rich in distinct era spirit and strong military characteristics, passionately singing the praises of contemporary soldiers' lofty sentiments. Among all the songs that sing of soldiers and praise the army, the "Military March" suite created and performed by the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe is particularly distinctive. This suite consists of seven songs, starting with "The March of the Military Flag," followed by depictions of new recruits, reconnaissance soldiers' lives, military-civilian friendship, border sentiments, soldiers' inner monologues, selfless dedication, and finally "The Name of the Soldier," showcasing the rich and varied life in the barracks and revealing the colorful inner world of today's soldiers. In terms of musical structure, it has both fresh and vigorous, passionate and unrestrained marching songs, as well as light and lively, colorful lyrical songs. The entire suite is coherent and organically unified, yet can be divided and combined, with each song able to stand alone. Whether in terms of tonality, mode arrangement, tempo, emotional pace, melodic color, or harmonic techniques, there are new pursuits.

Reform and opening up have brought vibrant changes to the motherland and the barracks. Soldiers in the 1980s, compared to those in the 1950s and 1960s, have greatly improved their cultural education and military skills, and the creation of military-themed songs also faces the new task of innovation and breakthrough. How to use musical forms to reflect the colorful life in the colorful barracks of the new era and express the soldiers' hearts in the military life of the reform era, we can see from the military arts performance that military music workers have made some successful explorations in this regard. Generally speaking, the military is a world of men, so it is more necessary to have music with a masculine spirit to inspire a fighting spirit. However, soldiers also have rich inner emotions, and the style of some marches from the 1950s and 1960s is obviously no longer able to meet the spiritual needs of soldiers in the 1980s. Military music workers have keenly noticed this change. The Navy Song and Dance Troupe's "Emotions Tied to the South China Sea," the Air Force Song and Dance Troupe's "Melodies of the Blue Sky," and the Second Artillery Force Song and Dance Troupe's "Song of the Rocket Force" all draw on their own regional characteristics, whether borrowing the waves of the sea, the blue sky and white clouds, or the deep mountains and dense forests, to express new life. The biggest difference between the music of these three performances and past military-themed music lies in the fact that the lyricists and composers have broken away from the rigid structure of writing military-themed music in the past, focusing instead on the innovation of melody and rhythm. Songs like "Giving You a Shade," "South China Sea, the Necklace of the Motherland," "Island Love," "Hometown is Beijing," "Blue Sky, Our Cradle of Flight," "The Motherland in My Daughter's Heart," "Song of the Rocket Force," "Soldier's Landscape," and "Love for the Distant Mountains" have concise lyrics and smooth tunes. They have abandoned the common problem of songs that only emphasize rhythm and neglect melody, resulting in shallow content and pale thoughts, making a beneficial attempt to create military songs of a higher level with Chinese style and contemporary characteristics. In addition, from an overall perspective, the music creation of the Lanzhou Military Region Combat Song and Dance Troupe has a rugged and solemn Northwest flavor, and their "My Beloved Dombura" expresses a strong Xinjiang color; the music creation of the Nanjing Military Region Frontline Song and Dance Troupe is as gentle and emotional as the Jiangnan waterways, and "Hometown Alley" and "Mulberry Path" are so fresh and pure, simple and elegant; the music creation of the Guangzhou Military Region Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe carries the fragrance of the south, and "Old Man Peak" is full of sighs and solemnity, inspiring deep thought; the music creation of the Jinan Military Region Vanguard Song and Dance Troupe and the Chengdu Military Region Song and Dance Troupe makes people feel the flourishing of national music culture in the new era. These distinctive musical styles are like colorful flowers, adorning military music beautifully and abundantly.

While enthusiastically presenting the life of contemporary soldiers, the musicians have not forgotten the history and traditions of the people's army. Because in this new historical period, we still need to inherit the glorious past and carry forward that spirit and that state of mind. The "Wind from Taihang" by the Combat Song and Dance Troupe is a grand and far-reaching song and dance drama, with its music creation based on the folk music of Shanxi and Hebei, and occasionally interspersed with elements of revolutionary historical songs, using a form of solo and chorus interweaving, singing the praises of the Taihang people and soldiers during the Anti-Japanese War. The "Thinking of Yan'an" by the Combat Song and Dance Troupe is a suite, using songs to create the artistic images of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, and from the leaders, delicately and passionately embodying the people's support and love for the Chinese revolution. Young composer Guo Hongjin's music for the dance drama "Meteor in the West" is technically unique and profound in its imagery, with a tragic yet intricate beauty.

Some of the musical performances in this military arts performance are not entirely satisfactory. In particular, there are very few outstanding works that can evoke a strong response from the masses. Some works lack individuality and seem familiar. Some works have musical and lyrical images that are too general and lack depth. The practice of musical creation tells us that truly great songs that can endure in the hearts of the people must come from life, have a solid foundation in national culture, and be inspired by the spirit of the times. Only in this way can the music industry achieve great development.

　　绿色风采　时代旋律
　　陈大鹏
    在我国的音乐发展事业中，军队的音乐建设始终占有重要的一席之地。几乎每一个时代，都有部队音乐工作者创作的歌曲在社会上流行；几乎每一次国内重大音乐比赛中都有部队音乐工作者的作品获奖。最近举行的庆祝建国40周年全军文艺调演，集中展现了近几年军队音乐建设的成就。
    总政、北京军区、广州军区、南京军区、沈阳军区的歌舞团，几乎是不约而同地都以共和国卫士为主题。他们紧紧地抓住时代的脉搏，调动一切艺术手段反映人民的心声。《红星颂——共和国不会忘记》是一首对人民军队充满深情和崇高敬意的颂歌。作者站在时代的高度，用红星的形象，概括描绘了军人的风采和业绩。《共和国卫士之歌》调动独唱、重唱、合唱等多种手段，以开阔舒展的旋律和瞬息变换的合声色彩，把人们带进雄师竞发的壮阔场面。《中国的土地》、《跟你走》、《绿色的远山》、《人民英雄碑礼赞》、《想他爱他祝福他》、《看到我们就看到中国》、《祖国，请你检阅》等歌曲曲调流畅跳荡，通俗明朗，富有鲜明的时代精神和强烈的部队特色，热情讴歌了当代军人的崇高情怀。在所有歌唱军人、歌颂军队的歌曲中，总政歌舞团创作演出的《军旅之歌》组曲，颇具特色。这个组歌共有七首歌曲组成，以《军旗进行曲》为先导，接着表现新兵入伍、侦察兵生活、军民友谊、边防情思、战士内心独白、无私的奉献，到最后《军人的名字》，展示了军营丰富多采的生活，揭示出今日战士多彩的内心世界。在音乐结构上，既有清新刚健、热烈奔放的队列歌曲，又有轻松活泼、色彩丰富的抒情歌曲，整个组曲前后连贯，有机统一，但又能分能合，每首歌曲均可独立存在。不论在调性、调式的安排、节奏的快慢，情绪的疾徐，以及旋律的色彩，和声的手法上都有新的追求。
    改革开放，给祖国，也给军营带来了绚丽多采的变化。80年代的战士比起五六十年代的战士，其文化修养和军事素质都有了很大的提高，军事题材的歌曲创作也面临创新突破的新课题。如何用音乐文化形式来反映新时代多采军营中的多采生活，表现改革时代军旅生活中战士的心灵，从全军文艺调演中我们可以看到军队音乐工作者在这方面的一些成功探索。从整体来说，军队是一个男子汉的世界，因此，更需要具有阳刚之气的音乐以激发昂扬的斗志，然而，军人也有军人的丰富内在的情感，五六十年代的一些进行曲的风格显然已经不能满足80年代军人的精神需求。军队的音乐工作者敏锐地看到了这个变化。海军歌舞团的《情系南沙》、空军歌舞团的《蓝天的旋律》、二炮文工团的《火箭兵之歌》，都从自身的地域特点，或借大海波涛，或借蓝天白云，或借深山密林，表现新的生活。这三台晚会的音乐与过去军事题材音乐最大的不同点就在于词曲作者突破了以往写军事题材音乐一板一眼的章法，而是着眼于旋律和节奏的出新。《送你一片荫凉》、《南沙，祖国的项链》、《海岛恋》、《故乡是北京》、《蓝天，我们飞翔的摇篮》、《女儿心中的祖国》、《火箭兵之歌》、《士兵风景线》、《远山之恋》等歌曲，歌词凝练，曲调流畅。它们摒弃了一般歌曲只讲节奏不问旋律、内涵浅薄、思想苍白的通病，为创造较高层次的具有中国风格和当代特色的军旅新歌作了有益的尝试。此外，从整体上来看，兰州军区战斗歌舞团的音乐创作具有粗犷而凝重的西北风情，他们的《我心爱的冬布拉》表现出浓重的新疆色彩；南京军区前线歌舞团的音乐创作如江南水域一样轻柔而多情，《故乡的小巷》和《采桑小路》是那样清新可口，淳朴雅致；广州军区战士歌舞团的音乐创作带着南国的花香，《老人峰》的感叹沉吟却又苍凉凝重，启人思索；济南军区前卫歌舞团和成都军区歌舞团的音乐创作则让人感受到民族音乐文化在新时期的张扬。这些各具特色的音乐风格，就像一朵朵五彩缤纷的鲜花，把军旅音乐装缀得华美丰颖。
    在热情表现当代军人生活的同时，音乐家们并没有忘记人民军队的历史和传统。因为在新的历史时期我们仍然需要对光荣的过去加以继承，对那种风范那种气质那种精神境界加以弘扬。战友歌舞团的《风从太行来》是一部气魄旨趣深远宏壮的歌舞剧，其音乐创作以山西和河北民间音乐为基调，时而又穿插进革命历史歌曲的音乐因素，采用独唱、合唱交织的形式，借咏太行山来颂扬抗日战争时的太行军民。战斗歌舞团的《想延安》则是一部组歌，用歌曲塑造毛泽东、周恩来、朱德的艺术形象，从领袖身上细腻尽情地体现人民对中国革命的支持和爱护。青年作曲家郭宏钧为舞剧
  《西天的流星》谱写的音乐，技法独到、意境深远，悲壮中见精巧。
    此次全军文艺调演中的音乐节目，也有一些不尽如人意之处。尤其是出类拔萃、能在群众中引起强烈反响的作品为数甚少。一些作品缺少个性，似曾相识。一些作品有的音乐形象、歌词的形象大而不当，内容空泛。音乐创作的实践告诉我们，真正的、能在群众中传之久远的歌曲，必定是来自生活，具有扎实的民族文化根底和有感而发的时代激情。只有这样，音乐事业才能有大的发展。
