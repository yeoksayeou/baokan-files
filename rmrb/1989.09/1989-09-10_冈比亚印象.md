Gambia is a small and poor country, but it boasts beautiful scenery, warm-hearted people, and social stability. The government is taking active measures to overcome current economic difficulties. We are full of confidence in the future of our country,” said the Gambian Minister of Information and Tourism when receiving reporters.

Indeed, Gambia is a small country, covering an area of 10,367 square kilometers with a population of over 800,000. The per capita income is about $200, making it one of the least developed countries in the world. The capital, Banjul, is located on a peninsula where the Gambia River meets the sea, with a population of less than 50,000. There are no modern high-rise buildings, and the shop windows do not display dazzling goods. The only highway has not yet been paved with asphalt, but beggars and malnourished children are rarely seen. People dress neatly, observe discipline, and are courteous. The entire city has no traffic lights or traffic police, but vehicles move in an orderly manner. Bakau, located 10 kilometers from the capital, is a rising tourist city. Its white, soft sandy beaches, lush coconut groves, sturdy baobab trees, vibrant tropical gardens, and luxurious hotels attract many domestic and foreign tourists. When the reporter visited in May, the tourist season had just ended, and large groups of European "migratory birds" had already flown north, but in the hotels and seaside resorts, one could still see many late-arriving tourists and air hostesses in special uniforms.

Gambia is resource-poor and economically backward. Peanut cultivation, re-export trade, and tourism are the country's three main economic pillars. However, from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, due to prolonged droughts, agricultural output declined, and international market prices for peanuts plummeted, leading to a significant reduction in national export earnings. The national economy once fell into a predicament. From 1976 to 1986, Gambia's GDP decreased by 18%, per capita income fell by 57%, prices rose by 283%, and external debt increased to $320 million. With the support of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the international community, Gambia began implementing an economic recovery plan in August 1985, making necessary adjustments to economic policies: respecting the law of value and market mechanisms, liberalizing prices, and allowing the local currency to float freely against the pound; raising bank interest rates to attract foreign investment; streamlining institutions and reducing redundant staff; raising peanut purchase prices to encourage exports and implementing tax exemptions for imported production materials; promoting privatization, with the government signing contracts with several large enterprises to implement contracting; strictly controlling expenditures to reduce fiscal deficits.

In implementing the economic revival plan, the Gambian government showed great determination and resolve. In 1986, 14% of institutions were streamlined, 1,096 positions were eliminated, and 3,197 employees were laid off, while the customs, which had been embezzling funds, were rectified. To raise construction funds, it also raised the bank interest rate from 6% to 20%. It fully accepted the conditions of the International Monetary Fund to limit domestic consumption and prevent officials from borrowing foreign loans. To weather the difficulties, Gambians from top to bottom live a simple life. Several government departments are crammed into one office building, and luxury cars are not commonly seen. Even the president lives in an ordinary villa.

Due to these necessary reforms and adjustments, in just a few years, trade volume began to rebound, commerce thrived, and agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries saw varying degrees of growth. Foreign exchange reserves also increased, and people's living standards improved, especially for the rural population. In the 1987-1988 fiscal year, GDP grew by 5.4% compared to the previous year; per capita income increased by 13.9%; the number of tourists visiting Gambia was nearly 100,000, an increase of 12% over the previous year; inflation had dropped to its lowest point in five years. The Gambian people are delighted to see that the economic recovery plan's first goal of "controlling further economic deterioration" has been achieved, and the whole country is striving to achieve the second goal of "realizing sustained economic growth."

　　冈比亚印象
　　本报记者　杨汝生
    “冈比亚既小又穷，但风光美丽、人民热情、社会安定”，“政府正采取积极措施，以克服眼前遇到的经济困难。我们对国家的未来充满信心。”冈比亚新闻和旅游部长在接见记者时讲了这番话。
    的确，冈比亚是个小国，面积10367平方公里，80多万人。人均收入约200美元，是世界最不发达的国家之一。首都班珠尔建在冈比亚河入海处的一个半岛上，是座人口不足5万的城市。它没有现代化的高楼大厦，商店橱窗里也没有光彩夺目的商品，唯一的高速公路还没铺沥青路面，但很少见乞丐和营养不良的儿童。人们衣着整齐，遵守纪律，彬彬有礼。全市没有一个红绿灯，也无交通警察，但车辆各行其道，秩序井然。位于首都10公里处的巴考是崛起的旅游新城，它那洁白细软的沙滩，翠影婆娑的椰林，粗壮挺拔的猴面包树，争奇斗艳的热带花园，豪华舒适的旅馆，吸引着不少国内外游客。记者5月来访时，旅游旺季刚过，大批欧洲“候鸟”业已北飞，但在旅馆和海滨浴场上，仍可见到许多跚跚来迟的游客和身穿特制服装的空中小姐。
    冈比亚资源贫乏，经济落后。花生种植、转口贸易和旅游业是国家的三大经济支柱。可是，在70年代末到80年代初的几年里，由于持续干旱，农业产量下降，加之国际市场上花生价格暴跌，国家出口收入大大减少，国民经济一度曾陷入困境。1976——1986的10年间，冈比亚国民生产总值下降了18％，人均收入减少了57％，物价上涨了283％，外债增至3.2亿美元。在世行、国际货币基金组织和国际社长的支持下，冈比亚于1985年8月开始实行经济恢复计划，对经济政策进行了必要的调整：尊重价值规律和市场机制，放开物价，实行本国货币与英镑汇率自由浮动；提高银行利率，吸收外资；精简机构，裁减冗员；提高花生收购价格，鼓励出口，实行进口生产资料减免税制；促进私营化进程，政府与几家大型企业的负责人签订合同，实行承包；严格控制支出，以减少财政赤字。
    在执行经济复兴计划中，冈比亚政府表现了极大的决心与毅力。1986年精简了14％的机构，取消了1096个职位，裁员3197人，同时对中饱私囊的海关进行了整顿。为了筹集建设资金，它还将银行利率从6％提高到20％。全部接受了国际货币基金组织关于限制国内消费、官员私人不得借用外国贷款等条件。为了共度难关，冈比亚人从上到下都过着简朴的生活。政府好几个部挤在一幢办公楼里，豪华轿车也不多见。即使总统，也住在一个很普通的别墅里。
    由于实行这些必要的改革与调整，短短几年时间，贸易额开始回升，商业兴旺，农牧渔业有了不同程度的增长，外汇储备也有所增加，人民的生活水平得到改善，尤其是农村人口受益更为明显。1987——1988年度国民生产总值较上年增长5.4％；人均收入增长13.9％；来冈旅游的人数将近10万人次，较上年度增加了12％；通货膨胀已降到5年来的最低点。冈比亚人民高兴地看到，经济恢复计划“控制经济进一步恶化”的第一个目标已经实现，举国上下正为“实现经济持续增长”的第二个目标继续努力。（附图片）
