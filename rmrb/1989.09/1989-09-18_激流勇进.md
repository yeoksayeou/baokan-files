In my memory, many past events have faded, but one remains vivid to this day.

In the summer of 1964, the entire army was in the midst of a training peak, and our military's various reconnaissance teams were gathered on the banks of the Lancang River for armed swimming training.

In June, the Lancang River was lush with greenery, and the air was filled with the fragrance of tropical fruits. The towering mountains on both sides stretched into the clouds, and the surging waters in the gorge roared like a dragon breaking through the clouds and mist, rolling towards us. The sound of the rushing waters and the wind through the primeval forest created a symphony of life that shook the heart.

Some said that the Lancang is a wild horse that is difficult to tame. Like the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, it originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but it lacks the calmness of the Yellow River in winter and the breadth and clarity of the Yangtze. It always carries the wildness of the primitive, cutting through mountains and cliffs, rushing down a thousand miles. Throughout history, no army has ever conquered it. It is said that in the early 1940s, the arrogant Japanese invaders once occupied Tengchong in Yunnan and attempted to cross the Lancang River to launch a north-south pincer attack on our anti-Japanese forces in Southwest China. However, as soon as they reached the river, this group of self-proclaimed "long-lasting military fortune" was swallowed by the surging waters along with their floating bridge, and their tanks were swept away by the angry waves, leaving no trace.

Now, the young reconnaissance soldiers of the people's army are coming to tame this wild horse. We are going to set a precedent in history—armed swimming across the Lancang River.

On this windy and sunny day, the sunlight filtered through the treetops, casting a golden hue over the entire camp. In the gorge, a majestic eagle soared into the sky, circling above the river. In the midst of summer, the Lancang River, fueled by the boundless energy of nature, surged and swelled, with overlapping whirlpools growing more intense by the second. The soldiers responsible for measuring the flow rate and observing the water conditions rushed back and forth between the command post and the observation point on the riverbank. The water flow rate increased to nine meters per second, seemingly determined to challenge the people's soldiers.

My comrades and I were making the final preparations before the swim, tense but orderly. After all, the Lancang River is so treacherous that even swimming across naked is extremely difficult. Now we are going to swim across with an average of 30 kilograms of weapons and equipment on our backs! Moreover, 40% of the soldiers were "land ducks" just a few days ago, and the difficulties and dangers of collective armed swimming are obvious. If there is any carelessness in the preparations, such as the ropes tying the weapons and equipment to the body being too loose or too tight, it could endanger lives in the water. My classmates and I were checking and arranging our equipment under a large banyan tree when the platoon leader excitedly told us, "The chief of the General Staff is here to inspect us! The chief will personally give us a speech!" He then issued the order for everyone to assemble. We quickly lined up on the sand in the swimming formation, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the chief. Soon, Vice Chairman Peng Shaoqi, accompanied by military and division commanders, walked towards us with steady steps. He was dressed in a well-fitted military uniform, his robust figure and bronze-colored face bearing the marks of a hundred battles; his thick eyebrows and piercing eyes gave people a sense of determination, tenacity, and the confidence to conquer everything; the general's star on his shoulder shone brightly in the sun. He pointed to the towering mountains on the opposite shore and said in a booming voice, "A few days ago, the invaders' claws reached our southern waters, and dozens of planes bombed and strafed, creating the horrifying 'Tonkin Gulf Incident.' The glorious task of defending the southwestern gate of our motherland has fallen on your shoulders. Reconnaissance soldiers are the eyes and ears of the commander, the guides of the troops, and the elite of the army. You must carry on the glorious tradition of our army's crossing the Wu River and seizing the Luding Bridge, and the spirit of 'fearing neither hardship nor death,' to completely conquer this Lancang River obstacle. Let the wild horse of the Lancang River tremble before the heroic reconnaissance soldiers!" His thick Xiangtan accent drowned out the roar of the river, echoing in the hearts of the soldiers. The general's trust and expectations were like a giant rock thrown into the sea, stirring up the heroes' spirits. More than 800 soldiers unanimously responded, "Thank you for your trust, Chief!" "We will definitely complete the swimming mission!" At that moment, our hearts seemed to surge with the current, filled with determination and courage.

Five minutes later, the marching bugle echoed through the sky, and three green signal flares soared into the air. The commander issued the order to start swimming. The swimming heroes were divided into four echelons and, in the predetermined sequence, charged towards the river's heart. Our platoon was the vanguard, and my platoon leader and I were at the forefront, holding the military flag. The river wind blew fiercely, and the flag fluttered wildly. The raging waves rushed towards us, and the dizzying whirlpools spun crazily, trying to swallow us. Under the scorching sun, the river water was still bone-chillingly cold, with a temperature difference of nearly twenty degrees between the water and the air. Due to the heavy load on our bodies and the flag in our hands, our physical strength was rapidly depleted. The icy river water numbed my entire body, and before reaching the middle of the river, my limbs began to fail me. The platoon leader, who was an excellent swimmer, gasped and said, "This... wild horse... is really... hard... to tame!" I was about to say something to the platoon leader when a huge wave hit me, and the murky river water made me gasp for breath. Everything went black, and the flag I was holding fell, and my loaded body began to sink. I quickly kicked my feet and struggled upward, trying to reach the middle of the river, but a hidden current from the riverbed pushed me back. Looking around, my comrades were also unable to reach the middle of the river, and our formation had begun to scatter. Although there were those who had grown up by the Yangtze River and were like "dragons in the waves," and those who had crossed the Jinsha River as if it were a game, and those who had grown up in the sea as fishermen's sons, these water dragons not only had to carry heavy loads but also had to drag a comrade with poor swimming skills, so they all looked very tired. A comrade from the second platoon from the Guizhou mountains was pulled into a whirlpool, and the second platoon leader who was pulling him also sank. If they were not rescued in time, both would be buried in the river. Two sailors from our platoon rushed over, grabbed the second platoon leader's backpack, and after a struggle, pulled the two out of the whirlpool. With great difficulty, we finally broke into the middle of the river, but a greater challenge awaited us. The raging current in the middle of the river pushed us rapidly downstream with immense force, and even larger and more powerful waves rose like mountains, one after another. Everyone's physical strength was almost depleted, and a few comrades had been swept away from the formation. If we went any further, we would reach the notorious danger zone of the Lancang River—Hua Yu Dong. There, the water drops sharply, and the riverbed is filled with reefs, creating waves as high as several meters. It is said that even the fish there are battered and bruised, so people named it "Hua Yu Dong." During the adaptation training, a rubber boat was swept into Hua Yu Dong and disappeared in an instant. If a fully loaded person were to be swept down there, the consequences would be unimaginable. Everyone knew the danger, so they struggled desperately, but the merciless river water gradually pushed us towards this deadly section.

At this critical moment, an old soldier with graying temples swam from the back of the formation. He swam sideways, using one arm to quickly propel himself to my side, and while helping me straighten the flagpole, he asked, "Kid, can you make it?" I nodded. I squinted my blurry eyes and finally recognized that it was Vice Chairman Peng. My spirits immediately lifted. I had heard from the commander that when Vice Chairman Peng was around our age, he was already a red army general with outstanding achievements. His left hand was blown off by an enemy shell during the Fourth Encirclement Campaign, when he was just over twenty. Since then, he has wielded his remaining arm to command tens of thousands of troops, active on the Long March, in the anti-Japanese war, and in the battles of the War of Liberation, becoming a respected figure in the entire army and a name that struck fear into the hearts of the enemy. Now, the general, nearing sixty, relies on his excellent swimming skills honed in the Xiang and Hu lakes, waving his giant arm to cut through the waves, leading the swimming formation like he led his troops in battle during the war years. Seeing this veteran general, our beloved predecessor, and that lone arm struggling against the raging current, a surge of warmth spread through my body. I don't know where I found the strength, but I handed the military flag to the platoon leader, grabbed the general's hand, and wanted to help him ashore. The general understood my intention and quickly said, "I can do it!" Then, like a pillar in the current, he stood in the water, raised his head, and shouted to the swimming formation, "Comrades! Hold on to the end, struggle forward, and victory is ours!" He commanded the swimming formation like he commanded an assault in battle. The general's appearance greatly encouraged the young heroes. I and a few comrades with good swimming skills stayed by the general's side, doing our best to protect his safety. Several sailors on the shore who were ready to provide emergency assistance also rushed over to protect the chief. We heard Vice Chairman Peng say, "You are the first echelon, the vanguard. You must quickly break through the current and get ashore. Otherwise, you will hold back the following echelons and cause greater danger!" With that, he led the way forward. The general gave us tremendous strength. In this icy current, even we young soldiers with two arms found it hard to endure, let alone a general in his sixties with only one arm, who had to exert so much effort and possess such tenacious willpower! I was deeply moved, and my eyes welled up with tears of emotion. The swimming army followed the general, broke through the middle of the river, and quickly swam ashore. The general turned back and looked at us, smiling so warmly and proudly. We, several hundred swimming heroes, simultaneously raised our right hands and saluted the general with a solemn military salute.

The unprecedented armed swimming across the Lancang River was successfully completed. The Lancang River—the untamable wild horse, the uncontrollable dragon—bowed before the soldiers of the people's army. The river water panted and moaned, helplessly flowing past us. In the distance, the sound of the waves crashing against the reefs in Hua Yu Dong echoed eerily.

The general stood tall, facing the surging river, with his empty sleeve fluttering in the wind; his robust figure, in the setting sun, stood even more majestically. The general not only led us to conquer the Lancang River obstacle but also led us, young soldiers with little experience, to conquer our own weakness, achieving a leap in our hearts and spirits.

    激流勇进
    王世坤
    在我的忆记里，许多往事已经淡漠了，但有一件至今仍历历在目。
    1964年仲夏，那时全军掀起训练高潮，我们军的各个侦察分队，集中到澜沧江边进行武装泅渡训练。
    6月的澜沧江畔，浓荫蔽日，到处是亚热带花果的芬芳；两岸高耸入云的群山穿绿着黛；峡谷中汹涌澎湃的江水，似一条苍龙穿云破雾，翻滚而来，那势如万马奔腾的咆哮声与原始林海的风涛声汇成一曲震撼人心的生命交响曲。
    有人说，澜沧是一匹难以驯服的野马。它和长江黄河一样发源于青藏高原，可它的性格中却没有黄河冬季的平静缓散，也没有长江的宽厚、清澈，它永远带着原始的野性，劈山斩崖，一泻千里。古往今来，还不曾有征服过它的军队。相传本世纪四十年代初，骄横不可一世的侵华日军一度攻占云南腾冲，妄图进而跨越澜沧天险，南北夹击我抗日的大西南。然而，到了江边，这群自诩“武运长久”的狂徒刚架起浮桥，连人带桥被滔滔江水吞没了，坦克也被愤怒的波涛冲得无影无踪。他们奈何不了这澜沧天险。
    如今，人民军队的年轻侦察兵要来驯服这匹野马了。我们要开千万年历史之先例——武装泅渡澜沧江。
    这天风和日丽，阳光透过林梢，洒向绿林中的帐篷，把整个军营镀上一层金黄色。峡谷中一只雄鹰冲天而起，盘旋在江面上空。时值盛夏，澜沧江水凭着大自然赐予的无穷能量，不时猛涨，重叠着的漩涡一个急似一个。负责测量流速、观察水情的战士，来回奔跑在指挥部与江边观测点之间，江水流速增至每秒九米，似乎决心同人民战士一决高低。
    我和战友们紧张而有秩序地作着泅渡前的最后准备。要知道，这澜沧江连赤身横渡都十分困难，现在我们竟要平均背负30多公斤的武器装备！更何况，40％的战士几天前还是“旱鸭子”，要集体武装泅渡，困难和危险是不言而喻的。准备工作稍有不慎，比如捆绑在身上维系武器装备的绳索松紧不当，到了水里就可能危及生命。我和班里的几个同志在一棵大榕树下互相检查整理装备时，连长走过来兴奋地告诉大家：“总参首长来检阅我们了！首长要亲自给我们作动员！”接着发出了全体集合的口令。我们迅速在沙滩上按泅渡队形排好队，怀着激动的心情等着首长到来。不一会，彭绍辉副总长在军、师首长的陪同下，迈着稳健的步履来到我们面前。他穿一身合体的军装，魁梧的身躯和紫铜色的脸庞记录着他身经百战的不寻常经历；浓眉下一双炯炯有神的目光，给人以坚毅、顽强和征服一切的信心；上将星徽在灿烂的阳光下闪耀着金光。他用右手指着对岸的巍巍群山，口里发出了洪钟般的声音：“几天前，侵略者的魔爪伸向了我国南海北部，几十架飞机狂轰滥炸，制造了骇人听闻的‘北部湾事件’。保卫祖国西南大门的光荣任务历史地落到了你们肩上。侦察兵是首长的耳目，部队的向导，军队的精英，你们要发扬我军强渡乌江、飞夺泸定桥的光荣传统，发扬‘两不怕’的精神，彻底征服这澜沧天险，让澜沧江这匹骄狂的野马在英雄的侦察兵面前发抖吧！”他那浓厚的湘潭口音压过咆哮的江涛声，久久在战士心中回荡。将军的信任和期待，犹如巨石投入大海，激起了战士心中的豪情。800余名战士一致回答：“感谢首长信任！”“坚决完成泅渡任务！”这时候，我们心中仿佛激流翻腾，充满了决心和勇气。
    五分钟后，嘹亮的进军号震动长空，三颗绿色信号弹腾空而起，指挥员发出了泅渡开始的命令。泅渡健儿分成四个梯次方队，按预定序列，直逼江心。我们排是泅渡突击排，我和班长举着军旗游在最前面。江风紧吹，军旗猎猎，发狂的波涛迎面扑来，一个个使人头晕目眩的漩涡疯狂旋转着，猛烈地撕扭着，要把我们吞噬。炎炎烈日下，江水仍然刺骨地寒冷，水里水外，温差竟达二十几度。由于全身负重，又举着旗，体力消耗极大，冰冷的江水又刺得我周身发麻，还没到中流，手脚就渐渐不听使唤了。水性极好的班长也喘着粗气对我说：“真是……野马……难……驯服啊！”我刚想给班长说句话，一个大浪打来，浑浊的江水呛得我透不过气。眼前一花，举着的旗倒了，负重的身体直往下沉，我赶快双脚猛蹬，尽力向上一挣，想扑进中流去，可江底翻涌起来的一股暗流又把我托了回去。回顾左右，战友们也没能顺利进入中流，而且队形已开始散乱。队列中虽有长江边长大的“浪里白条”，也有把横渡金沙江当作儿戏的“混江龙”，还有从小在海水里泡大的渔民之子，但这些水中蛟龙，不仅要全身负重，还要拖一个水性差的战友一起搏击风浪，所以都显得十分吃力。二班一个来自贵州山区的同志被漩涡卷了下去，拖着他的二班长也沉了下去，如果抢救不及，两人都要葬身江底。班里的两名水手急冲过去，抓到二班长的背包往上提，经过一番搏斗，被卷进漩涡的两个人被拉出了水面。好容易，我们终于闯进了江心中流，而更大的考验也随之而来。湍急的中流更加不可一势地以巨大的冲击力把我们急速地冲向下游，更大更猛的江浪像山峰一样一个接一个。大家的体力消耗几乎接近极限，有几个战士已被冲离队形。再下去，就是澜沧江上有名的险关——花鱼洞。那里江水落差大，江底礁石密布，激起高达数丈的巨浪。据说那儿的鱼也被冲撞得遍体鳞伤，所以人们给它取了个名字叫“花鱼洞”。部队还在进行适应性训练的时候，有一艘橡皮舟，就被冲进花鱼洞，眨眼之间没了踪影。全身负重的人要是被冲下去，后果不堪设想。大家都知道这一危险，因而顽强地拚搏着，可是无情的江水却把我们渐渐推向这个要命的地段。
    在这危急关头，从队伍后冲上一位双鬓斑白的老战士。他斜身侧泳，一只手臂急速地划动着游到我身边，一面用力地把我手中的旗杆扶正，一面问：“小鬼，能行吗？”我点了点头。我睁大模糊的眼睛，才看清是彭副总长到了我的身边，精神不由一振。听师长讲，彭副总长和我们年纪差不多的时候，就是一位立下了赫赫战功的红军将领了。他的左手就是在第四次反围剿战斗中被敌人的炮弹炸断的，当时他刚二十出头。从此，他挥动剩下的独
  臂，指挥千军万马，活跃在长征路上，出没在抗日
  的烽火中，拚杀在解放战争的战场上，成了全军敬
  仰，敌人闻之丧胆的“独臂将军”。如今，年近花
  甲的将军又凭着在三湘两湖中练就的一身好水性，
  挥舞着巨臂劈波斩浪，像战争年代率领将士们冲锋陷阵一样，冲在泅渡队伍的最前列。看着这位身经百战的将军，我们爱戴的前辈，看着那条与急流怒涛拚搏着的独臂，一股热流涌遍全身。不知那来的劲，我把军旗交给班长，拽住将军的那只手，就要送他上岸。将军明白了我的心意，连忙说：“我行！”接着他像中流砥柱，踩着水，昂起首，朝着泅渡队伍大声喊话：“同志们！坚持到底，奋力向前，就是胜利！”他像当年指挥一场攻坚战一样指挥着泅渡队伍。将军的出现，极大地鼓舞了年轻的勇士。我和几个水性好的同志靠在将军身旁游着，竭力保护他的安全，岸上几个准备应急救人的水手也急冲过来保护首长。只听彭副总长说：“你们是第一梯队，是突击排，要赶快冲出激流，尽快上岸。否则，将压住后续梯队，造成更大的危险！”说完，他率先向前冲去。将军给予我们巨大的力量。在这冰冷的激流中，我们两臂俱全的年轻战士尚且感到吃不消，而只有一支胳膊年过半百的老首长，要付出多大的力气，具备多么顽强的毅力啊！我深深地感动了，鼻子一酸，眼中满含激动的泪水。泅渡大军紧跟在将军身后，冲过中流，迅速游上了对岸。将军回首看着我们笑了，笑得那样亲切，那样豪迈。我们几百名泅渡健儿，不约而同地抬起右手，给将军行了一个庄严的军礼。
    千古无先例的武装泅渡澜沧江胜利结束了。澜沧江——这难以驯服的野马，这难以制服的苍龙，在人民军队的将士面前屈服了。江水喘息着，呜咽着，无可奈何地从我们面前走过。远处传来花鱼洞惊心动魄的浪涛撞击礁石的轰响。
    将军单手叉腰，面对滔滔江水迎风屹立，一只空袖随风飘动；魁梧的身躯，夕阳下，愈加伟岸。将军不仅率领我们战胜了澜沧天险，还率领我们这些涉世尚浅的战士战胜了软弱的自我，实现了心灵上、精神上的飞跃。
