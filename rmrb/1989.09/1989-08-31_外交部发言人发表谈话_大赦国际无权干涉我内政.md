The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing, said at a press conference this afternoon that any foreign country or international organization has no right to interfere in matters that are purely internal affairs of a country. Amnesty International's criticism of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot is completely groundless and unreasonable. When asked to comment on Amnesty International's related report, the spokesperson said, during the riot in Beijing in early June, a very small number of people used terrorist methods and violent actions in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government. Their actions seriously violated the Chinese Constitution and criminal law, and were in no way a human rights issue. The Chinese government's arrest and trial of these criminals are completely justified and righteous, and are within the scope of China's sovereignty.

    外交部发言人发表谈话
    大赦国际无权干涉我内政
    新华社北京8月31日电　外交部发言人李肇星今天下午在新闻发布会上说，任何外国或国际组织都无权干涉纯属一个国家内政的问题。大赦国际对中国平息反革命暴乱一事的指责是毫无根据和毫无道理的。在应记者要求评论大赦国际的有关报告时，发言人说，在北京发生的6月初的暴乱中，极少数人采用了恐怖手段和暴力行动，企图推翻合法政府，他们的行为严重违反了中国宪法，触犯了刑律，根本不是什么人权问题。中国政府依法逮捕这些犯罪分子并对他们进行审判是完全正当的、正义的，是中国主权范围内的事。
