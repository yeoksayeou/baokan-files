Linfen Develops 20,000 Mu of Tidal Flats

TAIYUAN, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) — Linfen City in Shanxi Province has developed 20,000 mu of tidal flats along the Fen River, increasing the amount of arable land by that much.

The tidal flats along the Fen River in Linfen City total 53,000 mu and have long been abandoned, with almost no development or utilization. The city government has clearly stipulated that "whoever develops benefits, whoever invests profits." This policy has mobilized villages along the river to develop and utilize the tidal flats. In April of this year, Linfen City organized 100,000 people for voluntary labor to develop the tidal flats along the Fen River. In just 40 days, 7,600 mu of land were reclaimed, and now beans and water chestnuts have been planted, growing well.

    临汾开发滩涂二万亩
    本报太原9月25日电　记者王艾生报道：山西临汾市开发汾河滩涂，到今年8月，已增加可耕地2万余亩。
    临汾市段的汾河滩涂共有5.3万余亩，多年废弃，基本上没有开发利用。市政府明确规定“谁开发谁受益、谁投资谁得利”，发动沿岸各村庄开发利用滩涂。今年4月，临汾市又出动10万人义务劳动，治理开发汾河滩涂，40天时间就造地7600亩，现已种上豆子、莲菜，长势很好。
