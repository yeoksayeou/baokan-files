The Uygur art treasure Mukam, which has been passed down orally among the Uygur people for over a thousand years, has recently achieved great success in major performances both domestically and internationally. Two years ago, the Xinjiang Mukam Performance Troupe was invited to participate in the "Court Arts Festival" in the United Kingdom, where their performance shook the Royal Albert Hall. Last year, at the 12th Asian Arts Festival in Hong Kong, their performance caused a sensation.

Mukam means a suite of compositions. The Twelve Mukams are like twelve close sisters who lead the arts of song, music, and dance in the traditional culture of the Uygur people. The musical genres are diverse, and the melodies are rich. The entire suite is divided into three parts. The first part consists of 4 to 11 songs and 2 to 6 interludes. The most typical singing style, "Sanxu," is often seen in folk performances. According to traditional customs, the "Sanxu" is performed by an elder playing the Satay solo, while everyone sits around and listens attentively. The elder's strong and ancient voice seems to tell the story of the Uygur people's yesterday. The second part, "Dasitan," is a suite of narrative songs consisting of 3 to 4 songs and musical pieces, with content drawn from folk legends. The third part, "Maixilafu," is an indispensable musical and dance chapter in the Uygur people's festivals or after harvest celebrations. It is a suite of songs and dances consisting of 2 to 7 songs, with lively melodies and clear rhythms. The songs and dances are continuous, and from beginning to end, people sing and dance, with men, women, old, and young all excitedly spinning in the joy of the dance, reaching a climax.

The Twelve Mukams include a total of more than 170 song tunes and 75 musical pieces. If performed from beginning to end, it would take more than 20 hours. These 12 grand compositions, whether in terms of their ideological content, complete structure, or performance form, all demonstrate the outstanding musical creativity of the Uygur people and vividly represent the cultural traditions and national characteristics of the Uygur people.

Mukam has been scattered among the folk for a long time, passed down through traditional master-apprentice relationships by folk professional musicians. It was not until 1950 that the first recording of the "Twelve Mukams" was made. In 1960, after long-term efforts by music and art workers in Xinjiang to collect and compile, a systematic book was published. In recent years, the Mukam Research Room of the Xinjiang Art Research Institute has formed a Mukam Performance Troupe, which for the first time staged the Mukam "Chebyat" in its entirety and in its original form, vividly reproducing the ancient and unique charm of Mukam through a combination of sound and image.

The late Comrade Zhou Yang once said at the Fourth National Congress of Literature and Art that the "Twelve Mukams" are "a great treasure in the history of Eastern music that has been passed down for over a thousand years."

    维吾尔族艺术瑰宝木卡姆
    在维吾尔族民间传唱了千余年的木卡姆，近年来多次在国内外重大演出中大获成功。前年新疆木卡姆演出团应邀参加英国的“宫廷艺术节”，其表演震撼了伊丽莎白音乐厅。去年在香港第十二届亚洲艺术节上演出，又轰动一时。
    木卡姆是组曲的意思，十二木卡姆犹如十二位亲密的姐妹，在维吾尔族传统文化的大家族中统领歌、乐、舞艺术，音乐体裁多样，曲调丰富。全曲共分三个部分。第一部分由4至11首歌曲和2至6首间奏曲构成，其中的“散序”是最为典型的演唱情态，常见于民间。按传统习俗散序曲由长者拨奏萨塔尔独唱，众人围坐四周洗耳聆听，长者苍劲、古朴的嗓音仿佛给人们讲述维吾尔人昨天的故事。第二部分“达斯坦”是由3至4首歌曲乐曲构成的叙事歌曲套曲，内容均为民间传说故事。第三部分“麦西莱甫”更是维吾尔人在节日或丰收之后的盛典中不可少的乐舞篇章。它是由2至7首歌曲构成的歌舞组曲，曲调生动，节奏明快，加之曲与曲连续不断，从始至终边唱边舞，男女老少群情振奋，争相旋转于舞蹈的欢快之中直达高潮。
    十二木卡姆共包括170多首曲牌和75首乐曲，如果从始至终演唱一遍长达20多个小时。这12部恢宏的大曲无论从思想内容还是从完整的结构形式、表演形态，都显示出维吾尔族人民杰出的音乐创作才能，典型而生动地表现出维吾尔族的文化传统和民族风貌。
    木卡姆过去一直散落在民间，由民间职业乐师承袭传统师徒关系，口传心授，世代延续。直到1950年才首次进行了《十二木卡姆》的录制工作。1960年，经过新疆音乐艺术工作者长期辛苦地搜集，整理成系统的书籍出版了。近几年，新疆艺术研究所木卡姆研究室又组成木卡姆演出团，第一次将其中之一的《且比亚特》木卡姆完整、原本地搬上舞台，以立体的声像集中地再现出木卡姆古朴、独具魅力的艺术风貌。
    已故周扬同志曾在第四届全国文代会上称，《十二木卡姆》是“流传千余年的东方音乐史上的巨大财富”。
