The autumn in Northeast China is crisp and clear.

From September 10 to 19, Premier Li Peng visited several rural areas, forestry regions, factories, enterprises, border outposts, and trade ports in the provinces and autonomous regions of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Liaoning. He conducted investigations and research on agricultural production, enterprise contract responsibility systems, border trade, market prices, and the living conditions of workers and farmers.

Agriculture is a crucial issue

Agriculture has always been a major concern in China. The success or failure of agricultural production directly affects the lives of 1.1 billion people and the development of the national economy. Although the south of China saw increased production this year, the northeast, known as China's "granary," suffered from drought, which has been a constant worry for Premier Li Peng. Whenever he visited a place, he would carefully listen to local officials' reports on the impact of natural disasters on agricultural production, inspect the fields to assess the damage, visit farmers' homes, and help solve local problems.

On the morning of September 11, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Heilongjiang Provincial Party Secretary Sun Weiben and Governor Shaoji Hui, traveled by minivan from Harbin to the fields of Chaoyang District in Shuangcheng City to inspect the agricultural situation. That day, it was drizzling, and the fields were muddy. He got out of the car three times along the way, entering the fields to inspect and inquire about the damage to corn, sorghum, and soybeans, and the reduction in yield. On the morning of September 17, Li Peng flew from Mudanjiang to Changchun. As soon as he got off the plane, he transferred to a minivan and, together with Jilin Provincial Party Secretary He Zukang and Governor Wang Zhongyu, went to the fields in Chengxi Township, Chaoyang District, Changchun City, to inspect the damage to the crops. On the morning of September 18, Li Peng departed from Shenyang and, accompanied by Liaoning Provincial Party Secretary Quan Shuren and Governor Li Changchun, went to the rice and corn fields in Bai Ta Pujing Township, Dongling District, Shenyang City, to inspect the damage. He also instructed the accompanying Minister of Agriculture He Kang to visit areas hundreds of miles away that were severely affected by the disaster to gather information.

During his inspection tour in the northeast, Premier Li Peng visited seven farmers' homes. On the morning of September 17, Premier Li Peng visited the home of Xu Hai, a contract farmer in Chengxi Township, Chaoyang District, Changchun City. Several nearby farmers, hearing the news, also rushed over to welcome the Premier. A farmer named Tai Xifeng excitedly said, "Premier Li, we have only seen you on television before. We never imagined that you would come to our homes today. You thinking of us farmers makes us indescribably happy!" After greeting everyone, Li Peng had a friendly conversation with Xu Hai: "How is your contracted crop this year?" "It's good," Xu Hai replied happily. "Isn't it dry?" Li Peng asked again. "We use water from the well to irrigate..."

The village's fish farming specialist, Xu Wen, has an annual net income of over 10,000 yuan and has been living a good life for several years, even building a new house. As soon as Li Peng entered the courtyard, he asked, "How much did this house cost you?" "Over 30,000 yuan," Xu Wen replied with a smile. "How many children do you have?" "One," Xu Wen's wife answered. "You are doing a good job with family planning!" Li Peng praised. Taking advantage of his wife's response, Xu Wen brought a basin with three lively carp to the Premier: "Please, Premier, have a look. These are the fish I raise." "You raise them very well!" the Premier said. "This year's fishing is bountiful. I want to give these few fish to the Premier as a token of my gratitude." Li Peng happily said, "I am glad to see your fishing thriving. I appreciate your kindness, but I cannot accept the fish."

Leaving Xu Wen's home, Li Peng visited the home of farmer Zhang Lizhi. The family members had all gone to work, leaving only Zhang Lizhi's elderly mother-in-law at home. Li Peng entered the house and, holding the old woman's hand, asked, "How old are you, Grandma?" "76," she replied. "Is your health good?" "Yes," she said. The accompanying people told the old woman that Premier Li Peng had come to visit her, and the old woman was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes, inviting the Premier to sit on the kang (a traditional heated bed).

The news of Li Peng visiting farmers spread throughout Minfeng Village, and the villagers happily gathered in the streets to welcome the Premier. Li Peng walked along the village road, waving and greeting the farmers. Under a row of large willow trees at the village entrance, a woman stepped out from the crowd and loudly said, "Premier, hello! We thank the Party's reform and opening-up policy for bringing good times to the farmers."

In Banqiaozhuang Village, Sulihe Town, Sushitun District, Shenyang City, Premier Li Peng had a friendly conversation with farmer Wang Zhuanshun: "How much was your per capita income last year? How much grain did you sell to the state?" "Per capita income was 1,000 yuan, and we sold over 30,000 jin of grain to the state." "How is the situation this year?" "This year, there is a shortage of water and electricity, and grain production will decrease by 40%. Of course, there is no problem with food." After visiting a farmer in the village who was having difficulties due to old age and poor health, Li Peng immediately told Governor Li Changchun and Minister of Agriculture He Kang that they should find a way to establish an insurance fund in rural areas to ensure that the elderly and sick are taken care of.

To help Liaoning solve its problems, Premier Li Peng instructed the deputy minister in charge of grain at the Ministry of Commerce, He Jihai, to immediately travel from Beijing to Shenyang on September 17. After arriving in Shenyang, He Jihai worked with Liaoning Province to develop specific plans to address grain supply issues.

We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class

During the investigation, Premier Li Peng visited the workshops of seven factories, including the Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Company, the Second Power Plant in Mudanjiang, and the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company, to understand production and management situations and to visit workers. He also convened meetings with the managers, general managers, and party secretaries of over 30 large and medium-sized enterprises, including the Harbin Boiler Factory, the State-owned Huolin Rubber Factory, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, and personally chaired three discussions.

At the Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Li Peng inquired about the research and production of aircraft and then went to the airport to watch the impressive flight performance of two types of aircraft produced by the company. He also inscribed the words, "Strive for the development of the helicopter industry."

On the afternoon of September 19, Li Peng visited the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company, which has 35,000 employees, and encouraged the workers to strive for production and make more contributions to the country. In the workshop, when the workers discovered that Premier Li Peng had come to visit them, they enthusiastically greeted the Premier, and workers on break also rushed over to welcome him. They surrounded Li Peng, asking questions, and Li Peng thanked the workers for their contributions to the country. The workers thanked the Party Central Committee and the State Council for their care.

On September 19, Premier Li Peng invited the managers, general managers, and party secretaries of 17 large and medium-sized enterprises, including the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, to a discussion in Shenyang, seeking their opinions on the enterprise contract responsibility system and investigating the income situation of workers and managers (general managers).

When discussing the current issue of the enterprise contract responsibility system, Li Peng said that the contract responsibility system cannot be changed and that policy stability must be maintained, especially during the adjustment period when there are more difficulties. There are unreasonable prices, and it is not possible to straighten them out immediately. There are difficulties with funds and raw materials, and there are market issues. If the contract responsibility system is not continued, it may return to the situation of eating from the same big pot, which is not conducive to turning pressure into motivation and overcoming difficulties in every possible way.

Li Peng pointed out that the contract system also has imperfections, such as the issue of unfair distribution. Currently, some enterprise employees have an annual total income of over 1,000 yuan, some 2,000 yuan, and some 3,000 yuan. Is it true that those who earn more are because their production is good and their management is effective? Not necessarily. The internal and external conditions of enterprises are different, including the state's investment in enterprises, the amount of low-priced raw materials, market conditions, and the contract base. We need to study a contract method that is more suitable for China's national conditions.

Li Peng also said that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. Of course, enterprise leaders play an important role in enterprises. It is inappropriate to emphasize any one side. Enterprise leaders are cadres who serve the people. The relationship between enterprise leaders and workers is not that of employers and employees. When Li Peng asked during the discussion whether there were any conflicts between the manager and the party secretary of the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company, the manager replied, "No, we are like brothers." Li Peng said that in factories and enterprises, the relationship between the manager and the party secretary should be properly handled, and the relationship between the manager and the workers should be properly handled. The manager and the party secretary should not discuss who is bigger or smaller, higher or lower; the manager and the party secretary have different divisions of labor and different responsibilities. The manager should accept the supervision of the party committee, and the use of cadres should be discussed by the party committee, but the manager's opinions should be fully respected.

Trade with the Soviet Union is part of our opening-up policy

On September 13, Premier Li Peng traveled by plane, car, and train from Harbin, enduring over five hours of travel, to reach Manzhouli, a border city in the western part of Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Manzhouli is connected by land and water with the Soviet Union and is an important land port for Sino-Soviet trade. The vast thousand-mile grasslands allow people to see where the sky meets the earth, and everything here is so peaceful. That day, it was misty and rainy, and as soon as Li Peng got out of the minivan, he went to the Eighteen-Li Border Inspection Station to visit the border guards and have a friendly conversation with the soldiers, encouraging them to build the border and develop friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Later, Li Peng inspected the first exchange yard of Manzhouli Railway Station and the container yard of the Foreign Trade Company's Manzhouli Branch, inquiring about the situation and problems in border trade transportation.

On the afternoon of September 15, Li Peng specially traveled from Mudanjiang to Suifenhe City, where he visited the border guards and learned about the border trade situation. He hoped that Suifenhe City would become a "window for foreign trade" and a "bridge for Sino-Soviet friendship."

In Manzhouli and Suifenhe, Premier Li Peng listened to reports from the leading cadres of the two cities and the Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang provinces and regions on the border trade situation. He was pleased to see that in the past two years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had made rapid progress in border trade, and Heilongjiang's border trade with the Soviet Union had also made beneficial progress. He pointed out that China's policy of opening up to the world, including to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is an important part of China's opening-up policy. Sino-Soviet economic and technological cooperation has a broad prospect. We should provide convenience and create conditions for expanding and further developing border trade.

The three most important numbers

During his inspection tour in the northeast, Premier Li Peng was most concerned about three numbers: the average income of farmers, the average income of workers, and the price increase index. He said that these three numbers are directly related to the lives of the people.

In Chengxi Township, Chaoyang District, Changchun City, Li Peng learned that before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, each workday in this village was worth only 8 jiao. Last year, the per capita income was 813 yuan, and although this year was affected by drought, the per capita income could still increase by 5% compared to last year. Li Peng happily told the farmers: "I wish you a prosperous life."

In the factories, Li Peng always inquired about the average income of workers and the price increase index. He said that as a socialist country, we must pay attention to whether the income of the broad masses of the people can gradually increase and whether their lives can gradually improve. The per capita income and price increase index are crucial, and all levels of government must pay close attention to this aspect. Due to the lack of guaranteed supply of low-priced materials, a responsible person from the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company said at the discussion that it is not possible to straighten out the prices, and he suggested simply raising the price of raw materials to ensure their supply. It is natural for comrades working in enterprises to have this idea due to the difficulty of running around for raw materials. Li Peng said after listening that raising the price of raw materials would inevitably lead to an increase in product prices, which would affect market prices, the price increase index, and the lives of the people. The problem of raw material prices still needs to be solved gradually and cannot be rushed.

After implementing the "383" project to control prices, Heilongjiang Province saw prices stabilize and even decrease, and the people were generally satisfied. Li Peng said that this work should be further deepened. In the previous period, the focus was on vegetable gardens to ensure the "basket of vegetables," and the emphasis was on major vegetables and staple vegetables. In the future, pig farming should make a breakthrough. It is too cold in Heilongjiang to raise pigs, and now the people have created some experience. We should mobilize scientific and technological personnel to study and break through this issue. It is not cost-effective to transport grain over a thousand miles to the interior and then transport pigs back to the northeast. We should gradually achieve self-sufficiency in oil and protein supply within the province.

Premier Li Peng paid great attention to the winter storage of large white cabbages in Harbin, saying that winter storage of large white cabbages is very important as a staple vegetable. With this staple vegetable, winter market vegetable prices can be suppressed. If there is a shortage of staple vegetables, market vegetable prices will rise. Now, many urban residents live in apartments, and it is inconvenient to store large white cabbages. There are also not enough cellars in the city, so we should encourage farmers to store them.

Premier Li Peng asked Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Secretary Wang Qun and Chairman Buhe in detail about the production and living conditions of herdsmen. When he learned that Inner Mongolia had a bumper harvest in animal husbandry this year, Li Peng required all levels of government to do everything possible to smooth out the channels of circulation and ensure that goods flow smoothly, so that herdsmen can increase production and income.

    李鹏总理四省区调研记
    中国教育报记者　杨建业　新华社记者　陈乃进
    东北，秋高气爽。
    9月10日至19日，李鹏总理先后到黑龙江、内蒙古、吉林、辽宁四省、自治区一些农村林区、工厂企业、边防哨所、贸易口岸，就农业生产、企业承包责任制、边境贸易、市场物价和工人、农民的生活情况等，进行了调查研究。
      农业问题至关重要
    农业问题在我国始终是个大问题。农业生产的丰歉，关系到全国11亿人口的生活和国民经济的发展。今年我国南方增产，但号称我国“粮仓”的东北遇旱，一直使李鹏总理放心不下。他每到一处总是仔细听取当地干部关于农业生产受灾情况的汇报，到田间察看灾情，登门看望农民，并帮助各地解决问题。
    9月11日上午，李鹏总理同黑龙江省委书记孙维本、省长邵奇惠乘一辆面包车由哈尔滨到双城市朝阳区田间察看农业情况。这天正值阴雨绵绵，田地泥泞。他一路三次下车，进入田间察看和询问玉米、高粱、大豆的受灾程度和减产情况。9月17日上午，李鹏同志乘坐飞机由牡丹江飞抵长春。他一下飞机，就转乘面包车，与吉林省委书记何竹康、省长王中禹一起，到长春市朝阳区城西乡的田间，察看了解庄稼受灾情况。9月18日上午，李鹏同志从沈阳出发，同辽宁省委书记全树仁、省长李长春到沈阳东陵区白塔堡乡的水稻和玉米田里察看灾情。他还委托同行的农业部长何康到数百里甚至千里之外的遭灾最重的地方了解情况。
    在东北调研期间，李鹏总理先后深入农村看望了七户农民。9月17日上午，李鹏总理来到长春市朝阳区城西乡民丰村农业承包户许海的家里，几位邻近的农民闻讯也赶来欢迎总理。一位叫台喜丰的农民兴奋地说：“李总理，以前我们只是在电视上看到您，万万没想到，今天您到家里来看我们。您想着我们农民，我们心中有说不出的高兴！”李鹏同大家打过招呼后，与许海亲切交谈起来：“你今年承包的庄稼怎么样？”“挺好，”许海高兴地回答。“不是旱吗？”李鹏又问。“我们用机井里的水浇……”
    这个村的养鱼专业户许文，每年纯收入在一万元以上，这几年生活一直过得很不错，也住上了新房。李鹏同志一进院就问：“你盖这套房子要多少钱？”“三万多元，”许文乐呵呵地回答。“你有几个孩子？”“一个。”许文的妻子回答。“你们执行计划生育政策好！”李鹏同志赞扬说。趁妻子说话之际，许文将一个放着三条活蹦乱跳大鲤鱼的脸盆端到总理面前：“请总理看看，这就是我养的鱼。”“你养得很不错嘛！”总理说。“今年渔业丰收。我想把这几条鱼送给总理，表表心意。”李鹏总理高兴地说：“你的渔业兴旺，我很高兴。你的一片心意我领了，这鱼却不能要。”
    从许文家出来，李鹏同志来到农民张立志的家里，家里的人都劳动去了，只有张立志的老岳母在家。李鹏同志进门就握着老人的手问：“你老人家多大年纪了？”“76岁。”“身体还好吧？”“好！”同行的人告诉老人这是李鹏总理看望她来了，老人激动得热泪盈眶，请总理到炕上坐坐。
    李鹏看望农民的消息传遍了民丰村，村民们高兴地涌上街头欢迎总理。李鹏同志在村道上边走边向农民招手致意。在村口的一排大柳树下，一位妇女从人群中走出来大声地说：“总理，您好！我们感谢党的改革开放政策，给农民带来了好日子。”
    在沈阳市苏家屯区十里河镇板桥堡村，李鹏总理与农民王占勋亲切交谈：“去年你家人均收入多少钱？卖给国家多少粮？”“人均收入1000元，卖给国家3万多斤粮食。”“今年情况如何？”“今年缺水、缺电，粮食受灾要减产4成。当然口粮没有问题。”李鹏同志在这个村看望了一户因年老体弱生活有困难的农民后，当即对省长李长春和农业部长何康说，应想办法在农村搞点保险基金，做到老有所养，病有所养。
    为了帮助辽宁解决困难，李鹏总理9月17日通知商业部主管粮食的副部长何济海即刻从北京赶到沈阳。何济海同志到沈阳后同辽宁省研究落实了解决粮食供应的具体方案。
        要全心全意依靠工人阶级
    调查研究期间，李鹏总理深入到哈尔滨飞机制造公司、牡丹江第二发电厂、辽阳石油化纤公司等7个工厂的车间了解生产和管理情况，看望工人。他还召集哈尔滨锅炉厂、国营桦林橡胶厂、鞍山钢铁公司、沈阳重型机器厂等30多家大中型企业的厂长、经理和党委书记开会，先后三次亲自主持座谈。
    在哈尔滨飞机制造公司，李鹏同志询问了研制和生产飞机的情况，又到机场观看了这家公司生产的两种飞机的精采飞行表演，并为该公司题词：“为发展直升飞机事业而奋斗”。
    李鹏同志9月19日下午来到有3.5万职工的辽阳石油化纤公司，勉励广大职工努力发展生产，为国家多做贡献。在车间，当工人们发现李鹏总理来看望他们时，热情地向总理问好，倒班休息的工人闻讯后，也赶来欢迎总理。他们把李鹏同志团团围住，问这问那，李鹏同志感谢工人们为国家做出的贡献，工人们感谢党中央、国务院对他们的关心。
    9月19日，李鹏总理邀请鞍山钢铁公司等17家大中型企业的厂长、经理、党委书记在沈阳座谈，征求他们对企业承包责任制的意见，调查工人和厂长（经理）收入情况。
    在谈到目前企业承包责任制问题时，李鹏说，企业承包责任制不能改变，要保持政策的稳定性，特别是在调整时期，困难比较多，有价格上的不合理，而一时又不能理顺，有资金原材料的困难，有市场方面的困难，如果承包责任制不继续搞下去，就有可能回到吃大锅饭的状况，不利于企业变压力为动力，不利于千方百计地去克服困难。
    李鹏指出，承包制也存在不完善的地方，如分配不公的问题，现在有的企业职工年总收入1000多元，有的2000元，多的3000元，是不是所得多的都是由于生产搞得好，经营有方？不一定，企业的内部外部条件不一样，包括国家对企业的投入、平价原材料的多少、市场情况，也与承包基数有关。要研究比较适合我国国情的承包方式。
    李鹏同志还说，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。当然，企业的领导者在企业中有重要作用。片面地强调任何一面，都是不合适的。企业领导是为人民服务的干部，企业领导同工人的关系，绝不是资本家和工人之间的雇佣和被雇佣的关系。
    当李鹏同志在座谈中询问辽阳石油化纤公司经理与党委书记有无矛盾时，经理回答说：“没有，我们是哥俩好。”李鹏同志说，在工厂企业，厂长同党委书记的关系要摆正，厂长同工人的关系要摆正，厂长和党委书记不应论谁大谁小，谁高谁低；厂长同党委书记是分工不同，职责不同，厂长要接受党委的监督，干部的使用要经党委讨论，但要充分尊重厂长的意见。对苏贸易是我对外开放一部分
    9月13日，李鹏总理从哈尔滨乘飞机、转汽车、换乘火车，经过5个多小时的劳顿，来到了位于内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟西部的边境草原城市满洲里。
    满洲里与苏联山水相连，是我国对苏贸易重要的陆路口岸。广袤的千里草原，使人们一眼便能看到天地相接的地方，这里的一切是那样的宁静。当天雾雨蒙蒙，李鹏同志一下面包车就去十八里边防检查站看望边防战士，同指战员们亲切交谈，勉励他们搞好边防建设，发展中苏两国人民的友谊。随后，李鹏总理察看了满洲里火车站第一换装场、外运总公司满洲里分公司集装箱货场，询问了边境贸易运输方面的情况和存在的问题。
    9月15日下午，李鹏总理由牡丹江专程到了绥芬河市，慰问边防战士，了解边贸情况。他殷切期望绥芬河市成为“对外贸易的窗口，中苏友谊的桥梁。”
    在满洲里和绥芬河，李鹏总理分别听取了两个市的领导干部和内蒙古、黑龙江两省区关于边境贸易情况的汇报。他听到、看到近两年来内蒙古自治区在边境贸易方面有了较快的发展，黑龙江对苏边境贸易也取得了有益的进展，表示高兴。他指出，我国实行开放的政策，面向世界各国，对苏联东欧的开放，也是我国开放政策的一个组成部分。中苏经济技术合作具有广阔的前景。要为扩大和进一步发展边境贸易提供方便，创造条件。
      最关心的三个数字
    在东北调查研究期间，李鹏总理最关心三个数字：一是农民的平均收入，二是职工的平均收入，三是物价上升指数。他说，这三个数字直接关系到人民群众的生活。
    在长春市朝阳区城西乡民丰村，李鹏同志了解到，党的十一届三中全会以前，这个村每个劳动日值只有8角钱，去年人均收入813元，今年虽然遭受旱灾，人均收入仍然可以比去年增长5％，李鹏高兴地对农民说：祝你们的日子越过越红火。
    在工厂，李鹏总理总是要询问职工平均收入和物价上升指数，他说我们是社会主义国家，一定要注意广大人民群众的收入能否逐渐有所提高，生活逐渐有所改善。人均收入和物价上升指数至关重要，各级政府要密切注意这方面的情况。由于平价材料供应得不到保证，辽阳化纤公司的一位负责同志在座谈中说，不理顺价格不行，他建议干脆提高原材料的价格，以保证原材料的供应。在企业工作的同志，苦于为原材料到处奔波，产生这一想法是自然的。李鹏同志听后说，提高原材料价格，产品价格势必上升，这影响到市场物价，影响到物价上升指数，影响到人民群众的生活。解决原材料的价格问题还得逐步来，不能太急。
    黑龙江省实施控制物价“383”工程后，物价稳中有降，群众比较满意。李鹏说，这项工作要继续深化，前一段主要是抓菜园子，保菜篮子，重点抓好大路菜、当家菜。今后养猪应有所突破，黑龙江太冷，养猪不易，现在群众已创造了一些经验，要动员科技人员来研究来突破，千里迢迢把粮食运到关内，又千里迢迢把猪运回东北，效益低浪费大，应逐步做到油脂蛋白的供应立足本省。
    李鹏总理十分关心哈尔滨的冬贮大白菜，他说冬贮大白菜作为当家菜很重要，有了这个当家菜，冬季市场菜价就可以得到平抑，当家菜不足，市场菜价就会上去。现在不少城市居民住了楼房，贮存大白菜不方便，城里又没有那么多菜窖，要鼓励农民贮存。
    李鹏总理向内蒙古自治区党委书记王群和自治区主席布赫详细询问牧民的生产生活情况。当得知内蒙古今年畜牧业大丰收时，李鹏同志要求各级政府要千方百计疏通流通渠道，做到货畅其流，使广大牧民增产增收。
