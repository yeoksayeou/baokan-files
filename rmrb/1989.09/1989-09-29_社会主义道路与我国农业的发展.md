Over the past 40 years, China's agricultural development has achieved remarkable success. The fundamental experience is that the Communist Party of China has led the vast peasantry to advance along the socialist path with Chinese characteristics, opening up a vast expanse for the prosperity and development of rural areas. The Eastern miracle—800 million peasants have achieved food security, and the self-sufficient economy is transforming into a commodity economy.

Over the past 40 years, China's rural economy has undergone the following stages of development.

First, from 1949 to 1958, China's rural economy developed rapidly. Agricultural production increased for nine consecutive years, farmers' incomes increased significantly, and farmers' living standards improved significantly.

Second, from 1959 to 1966, the rural economy experienced a tortuous path. In the second half of 1958, due to the launch of the Great Leap Forward, the establishment of people's communes, the denial of commodity production, and the denial of the principle of distribution according to work, the interests of the broad masses of peasants were harmed, and their enthusiasm for production was dampened. Coupled with natural disasters, agricultural production decreased for three consecutive years, and the country experienced three years of economic difficulties. In 1962, the state proposed the policy of adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement. By 1966, agricultural production in most parts of the country had recovered or exceeded the level of 1957.

Third, from 1967 to 1976, the Cultural Revolution turmoil spread to the countryside. Large-scale "self-reliance and mutual aid" was implemented, poverty-stricken transitions were made, capitalist tails were cut off, private plots were confiscated, household sideline production was restricted, and rural markets were closed. Rural economy and agricultural production stagnated for a long time.

Fourth, from 1978 to the present, rural reforms have been implemented, and agriculture has achieved tremendous development. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee formulated the "Decision on Accelerating Agricultural Development" (draft), proposing 25 policies for rural reform and development, adjusting the relationship between industry and agriculture, increasing agricultural investment, raising the procurement prices of agricultural and sideline products, and implementing the household contract responsibility system in rural areas. The collective economic management system was reformed, and a series of measures conducive to accelerating rural economic development were implemented. This greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of 800 million peasants for production, promoting the overall development of agricultural production and rural economy. China's rural areas have undergone historic changes. In 1984, grain production increased to 407.3 billion kilograms, a 44% increase from 282.7 billion kilograms in 1977, with an average annual growth rate of 5.4%. Cotton production increased from 40.98 million piculs to 125.16 million piculs, a 2.05-fold increase, with an average annual growth rate of 17.3%. The total agricultural output value increased from 125.3 billion yuan to 321.4 billion yuan, excluding price factors, a 69% increase, with an average annual growth rate of 7.8%.

In 1985, the central authorities clearly proposed to adjust the rural industrial structure and actively develop diversified operations. Since then, township enterprises have developed even faster in various places. In 1987, the total output value of township enterprises exceeded the total agricultural output value, becoming an important pillar of the rural economy. The rise of township enterprises provided an outlet for surplus rural labor and promoted the development of the rural commodity economy. However, due to the tilt of both urban and rural economies towards industry and some inappropriate measures, after the reduction in grain and cotton production in 1985, agriculture encountered new stagnation.

Over the past 40 years, although China's rural development has experienced a relatively tortuous path, under the leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the superiority of the socialist system, and relying on the hard work of the vast number of rural cadres and hundreds of millions of peasant masses, China's agriculture has still achieved tremendous success, with remarkable achievements and worldwide attention.

First, in the old China, peasants were in a state of being oppressed, exploited, and disorganized. Through land reform, peasants became the masters of the land. Through cooperative organizations, collective economies were established, and the socialist path was taken. After 1978, the household contract responsibility system was implemented, creating a form suitable to China's national conditions, realizing the specialization, commoditization, and modernization of agriculture under the conditions of socialist public ownership.

Second, in the old China, agriculture was traditional agriculture using backward tools and manual operations. After the founding of New China, while carrying out rural social reforms, we also carried out technical transformations of agriculture, carried out large-scale water conservancy projects, and established a relatively complete agricultural machinery industry. We developed agricultural science and technology and established a teaching, research, and promotion system for agricultural science and technology nationwide, making traditional agriculture take a big step towards modern agriculture. By 1988, the country had 870,000 large and medium-sized tractors, 5.95 million small and walk-behind tractors, a total agricultural machinery power of 265 million horsepower, a mechanized cultivation area accounting for 42.5% of the total cultivated area, an effective irrigation area accounting for 46.1% of the total cultivated area, an average of 14.8 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per mu, and an average of 49.3 degrees of electricity per mu. The level of agricultural modernization has been greatly improved.

Third, in the old China, the rural industrial structure was single, and it was a natural economy of self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency. In 1952, the commercial rate of agricultural products was only 30.5%, and by 1978, it had only increased to 39%. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee clearly proposed to adjust the rural product structure and develop diversified operations. Nowadays, rural areas not only have comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, but also have thriving industries, construction, transportation, commerce, and service industries, presenting a prosperous and thriving rural economic scene. In 1988, the commercial rate of agricultural products reached 51.1%, and the commercial rate of agricultural and industrial products in rural areas was 68.8%. The entire rural economy is transforming from a natural economy to a planned commodity economy.

Fourth, the reform of rural production relations and technological transformation have promoted the overall development of China's agricultural production and rural economy. In 1988, the national total agricultural output value was 586.5 billion yuan. Calculated at comparable prices, it increased 5.1 times compared to 1949, with an average annual growth rate of 4.8%. Among them, planting increased 3.5 times, forestry increased 27 times, animal husbandry increased 7.8 times, and fisheries increased 77 times. From 1950 to 1984, the total grain production in the world increased by 167%, with an average annual growth rate of 2.93%. During the same period, China's total grain production increased by 208%, with an average annual growth rate of 3.37%. In 1950, China's total grain production accounted for 16.6% of the world's total grain production, while in 1984, it had increased to 21.6%. China's cultivated land accounts for only 7% of the world's total cultivated land, but it has solved the food problem for 22% of the world's population. This is a prominent achievement of China's agriculture.

Fifth, in the old China, most peasants lived in poverty, "eating chaff and vegetables for half a year." With the development of the rural economy, peasants' living standards have been significantly improved. In 1988, the national per capita income of peasants was 545 yuan. The vast majority of peasants have solved the problem of food security, about 40% of peasants have shaken off the shackles of poverty, and about 10% of peasants have become relatively wealthy, with an average annual income of more than 1,000 yuan, living a well-off life.

Sixth, over the past 40 years, peasants have made tremendous contributions to the socialist construction of the country. From 1952 to 1988, over 36 years, peasants cumulatively sold 215.26 billion kilograms of grain to the state, an average of 5.98 billion kilograms per year, 161.24 million piculs of cotton, an average of 43.58 million piculs per year, and 119.64 million piculs of vegetable oil, an average of 32.34 million piculs per year. They also sold many other agricultural and sideline products, basically guaranteeing the development of the national economy and the living needs of the people across the country.

China's 40 years of rural development is a period of 40 years in which our Party, in accordance with the universal truth of Marxism, has reformed and improved rural production relations and promoted the development of rural productive forces. It is also a period of 40 years in which our Party has led hundreds of millions of peasants to adhere to the socialist path and continuously improve and develop it. The dawn of reform—finding a socialist path for agriculture suitable to China's national conditions

Over the past 40 years, China has carried out three major reforms of great significance in the development and improvement of rural production relations.

The first major reform is land reform. After the founding of the country, we implemented the Land Reform Law in the vast liberated areas, mobilizing the masses to confiscate the land of landlords and distribute it to landless and land-poor peasants without compensation, abolishing the feudal land system of exploitation, and realizing the system of individual peasant ownership of land. In practice, this great land reform movement was successful, promoting agricultural production, social stability and development, and preparing the ideological groundwork for the collectivization of agriculture.

The second major reform is the collectivization of agriculture. China's agricultural collectivization was carried out in accordance with Marxist cooperative theory and in steps according to China's national conditions, in line with the requirements of the development of productive forces, and the direction was correct. The rural areas implemented the basic system of public ownership of the means of production, enabling hundreds of millions of peasants to take the socialist path. On the basis of public ownership, unprecedented large-scale agricultural water conservancy basic construction was carried out, and scientific farming and agricultural modernization made significant progress. By 1978, approximately 1,000 billion yuan of public property had been accumulated, and agricultural productivity had been greatly improved. More importantly, 800 million peasants gained experience in participating in cooperative economic practices, and a large number of cadres and talents with management capabilities were trained, preparing the material and spiritual conditions for further reforms. From a comprehensive perspective, the historical role of China's agricultural collectivization in the 1950s should be fully affirmed. This is indeed a great historical victory. However, in the process of agricultural collectivization, after the summer of 1955, there was a period of excessive haste, rough work, and rapid changes. The forms were also too simple and uniform. Whether it was the advanced cooperatives or the later "three-level ownership with the team as the base," they all implemented an overly centralized management system, which could not well adapt to the characteristics of Chinese agriculture. This to a great extent offset the state's huge investment in agriculture and the hard work of hundreds of millions of peasants, and did not achieve the expected economic and social benefits, making agricultural production unable to develop as expected for a long time.

The third major reform is the implementation of the household contract responsibility system. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee, in response to the will of the people and respecting the creative spirit of the masses, promoted the household contract responsibility system nationwide. The implementation of the household contract responsibility system enabled us to, based on reality, inherit the positive achievements of more than 20 years of agricultural collectivization, and overcome the drawbacks of excessive concentration in the management of collective economies. The essence of implementing the household contract responsibility system is to appropriately separate the ownership and management rights of the means of production. The ownership of land and other major means of production remains unchanged, still under the socialist collective ownership, but through contracting, the management rights are divided into two levels: unified management by the collective and decentralized management by peasant households. What should be unified is unified, and what should be decentralized is decentralized. In this way, both the superiority of unified management by the socialist collective economy and the autonomy of decentralized management by peasant households can be fully utilized, making it more suitable for the characteristics of Chinese agricultural production, more in line with the current level of agricultural productivity in China, and more in line with the wishes of the broad masses of peasants. This overcomes many drawbacks of the original collective economy, solves some long-standing problems, and greatly promotes the development of agricultural production and the development of various undertakings in rural areas.

The implementation of the household contract responsibility system and a series of rural reform policies makes the socialist path more in line with China's specific conditions, making the superiority of the socialist system more fully realized. The enthusiasm of peasants for production is higher year by year, the situation of agricultural production is better year by year, and the improvement and rapid development of rural conditions have exceeded the expectations of many people, both domestically and internationally.

The Prospect of Development

—The Potential of Rural Areas is Great, and Pessimistic Views are Unfounded

After the unprecedented comprehensive bumper harvest in 1984, grain and cotton production decreased in 1985, and since then, agriculture has encountered new stagnation.

How should we view the stagnation of agriculture in recent years? Some comrades believe that the main reason for the stagnation of agriculture in recent years is that the household contract responsibility system is ineffective, and that only by adopting new forms of operation can agriculture achieve new breakthroughs. This view is divorced from reality. The main reason for the stagnation of agriculture in recent years is not the problem of the household contract responsibility system. Rather, it is that after the initial success of rural reforms, some comrades have overly optimistic estimates of the situation in agriculture, mistakenly believing that agriculture has passed the critical point, relaxing leadership and support for agriculture, tilting resources towards industry, and significantly reducing investment in agriculture and agricultural machinery, resulting in the deterioration of water conservancy, the aging of agricultural machinery, the weakening of the material and technological foundations of agriculture, the shortage and price increases of fertilizers and pesticides, the increase in agricultural production costs, and the lack of corresponding adjustments in the procurement prices of major agricultural products such as grains and cotton. The comparative benefits of agricultural production have declined, dampening the enthusiasm of peasants for agricultural production, especially grain and cotton production. This is the main reason for the stagnation of agriculture. Therefore, the view that the stagnation of agriculture is due to the household contract responsibility system is not in line with the facts. On the contrary, the household contract responsibility system is still the basic factor that has prevented agriculture from slipping and maintained rural social stability in recent years. The household contract responsibility system is in line with the current level of agricultural productivity in China and the wishes and interests of peasants. It is dangerous to try to change the household contract responsibility system and seek new development in agriculture without considering specific conditions. In fact, as long as we truly strengthen the leadership and support for agriculture, adjust the national economic structure, change the situation of overheating industry and cooling agriculture, adjust price policies according to the law of value, reduce the burden on peasants, and further play the role of the household contract responsibility system, the current stagnation of agriculture can be easily reversed.

Some comrades believe that "China's population is increasing, and cultivated land is decreasing," and that "the potential of small-scale farming has been exhausted," with limited supply, proposing that in the future, we should import grain for a long time. This view is also incorrect. It is a fact that China has a large population and limited per capita cultivated land resources. At this stage, the national economic strength is not strong, agricultural basic construction and agricultural machinery are not sufficient, and the ability to resist natural disasters is insufficient. Therefore, it is wrong to be blindly optimistic, believing that agriculture has passed the critical point and not paying attention to agricultural production and construction. However, we should not draw pessimistic conclusions from this. China's agricultural production potential is still great, and the prospects for agricultural development are promising. This is because, first of all, according to the calculations of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Comprehensive Survey of Natural Resources over many years, China currently has 2 billion mu of cultivated land, not 1.435 billion mu. Experts from several departments have calculated that even by the year 2000, there will still be more than 1.9 billion mu of cultivated land. In 1984, China's total grain production ranked first in the world, but the yield per mu was only 509 jin, ranking 18th in the world. If calculated based on the actual area, the yield per mu would be even lower, and the ranking would be even lower. Among the existing cultivated land, 2/3 is medium and low-yield land, with great potential for increase. Moreover, China has a lot of barren mountains, hills, and beaches that can be utilized. Secondly, the potential of China's agricultural science and technology is even greater. We already have a well-trained and powerful agricultural science and technology team. Since the rural reforms, agricultural research has made breakthrough progress, and there have been major achievements in breeding, cultivation, formula fertilization, and pest control, some of which have reached the international advanced level. As long as the conditions are ripe, the existing research results can be promoted and applied, and agricultural production can be increased several times, and grain production can reach a new level. Thirdly, there is still a lot of room for improvement in China's agricultural machinery industry. Currently, the amount of grain reduced due to the lack of fertilizers, pesticides, plastic film, agricultural machinery, diesel, and electricity is very significant. If the agricultural machinery industry is adjusted and improved to provide high-quality agricultural machinery products, agriculture can reach a new height. Fourthly, we have a large and hardworking team of agricultural laborers with a tradition of fine farming. Under the leadership of the Party, the advantages of the socialist system have been fully utilized, and many agricultural development miracles have been created. As long as our future policies are appropriate, the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of peasants can be further mobilized, and more agricultural development miracles can be created. In summary, the prospects for the development of China's agriculture are promising, and the pessimistic and outward-looking views are not advisable. The Path Forward—Stabilizing and Improving the Household Contract Responsibility System, Combining Family Management with Socialized Services

The household contract responsibility system, as a major reform of rural production relations and the management system of collective economies, is a unique creation of China, but it itself needs to be stabilized and further improved. First, we need to stabilize and improve the household contract level, do a good job in the contracting and leasing of land, adhere to the 15-year land contract period, strengthen peasants' sense of policy stability, encourage peasants to voluntarily increase agricultural investment, respect peasants' production and management autonomy, and give full play to the enthusiasm of family management. This is a major policy for rural areas; second, we need to strengthen the leadership and economic strength of the village level, do a good job in the socialized services before, during, and after agricultural production; third, we need to make corresponding reforms to the political and economic management systems, circulation systems, and scientific and technological systems at the county and township levels, so that they can be coordinated and compatible. By doing a good job in these three levels, we can promote the new rural management system to be perfected and fully play its role in promoting the development of productive forces.

Currently, the focus of rural work should be on the rectification and construction of village-level organizations and doing a good job in the socialized services of agricultural production. The basic characteristic of the household contract responsibility system is the combination of centralized and decentralized management and dual-level operation. Nowadays, agricultural production is no longer a self-sufficient small-scale economy, and it is not enough to rely on a single household. It requires mechanized cultivation, irrigation, and the supply of fertilizers and pesticides before, during, and after production. These are things that a single household cannot do, cannot do well, or cannot do economically, and require collective economies to operate and provide services. However, in many rural areas, in recent years, the enthusiasm of peasant households for management has been mobilized, but the advantages of unified management by collective economies have not been fully utilized. According to a survey by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, about 20% of village-level organizations nationwide are in a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis, and in some provinces and regions, the figure is 30% to 50%, and they cannot play the role of unified management. Peasants cultivate their own land and do not receive help from the collective, which naturally has a great impact on agricultural production. In this regard, there are also many good examples of combining centralized and decentralized management. Zhaodong City in Heilongjiang Province is a good example. This city has a population of 600,000 engaged in agriculture. In 1985, it produced 4.5 billion kilograms of grain and sold 1.6 billion kilograms to the state. In 1988, it produced 8.8 billion kilograms of grain and sold 4.04 billion kilograms to the state. This year, it can produce 9 to 9.5 billion kilograms of grain and sell 5 billion kilograms to the state. In just four years, grain production has doubled, and contributions to the state have increased by more than twofold. What is the key? The basic experience is two points: first, the leadership's thinking is correct, adhering to the principle of putting agriculture first, with all sectors supporting agriculture, adhering to agricultural water conservancy construction, adhering to scientific farming, and improving production conditions; second, the enthusiasm of both the collective and the peasants is fully mobilized. Peasants contract and manage their households, which is the same as the rest of the country. In addition, in all 326 villages in the city, the collective economy of each village can provide excellent services before, during, and after production, unified mechanized cultivation, unified irrigation, unified purchase of fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides, and some villages even deliver fertilizers directly to the fields. The advantages of unified management by the socialist collective economy are fully utilized. This material shows that it is not that the potential of the household contract responsibility system has been exhausted, but that there is still a lot of work to be done. We should strive to improve and develop this good form created by the Chinese peasant masses and fully play its role in rural development.

In recent years, after the stagnation of agriculture, the view that the household contract responsibility system is only a temporary measure has resurfaced, and some comrades vaguely propose to seek new economic forms. These views are inappropriate. The long-standing traditional view is that large-scale production is superior to small-scale production, and large-scale production is simply understood as the expansion of scale, with a large concentration of manpower and material resources in one place; and that socialized large-scale production and family management are opposed, believing that family management is incompatible with modern agricultural production. Domestic and international practices have shown that agricultural production is suitable for family management, and in economically developed countries, family management is still an important form of modern agriculture.

Over the past decade, the practice of China's household contract responsibility system has shown us a picture of family management combined with socialized large-scale production. The implementation of the household contract responsibility system makes peasants independent commodity producers, and the enthusiasm for commodity production is unprecedentedly high. The development of commodity production promotes the adjustment of the industrial structure, promotes social division of labor, promotes specialization, and some peasants will turn to the secondary and tertiary industries, while others will engage in agricultural machinery, plant protection, and other specialized services. As long as other social conditions are mature, they will give up the land to engage in other industries. In this way, the number of peasant households directly engaged in agricultural production will be greatly reduced, and their scale of operation will be correspondingly expanded, and their efficiency and income will be greatly improved. In this way, the peasant households engaged in agriculture are actually a link in the entire social production chain, incorporated into the cooperative system of socialized large-scale production. In recent years, the pilot projects of appropriate scale management in some regions have been effective. And they still adopt the form of household contracting and dual-level operation. Of course, at present, in most rural areas of the country, the conditions for such a scale have not yet been reached, and there is still a process of creating conditions. However, from these experimental models, we can see that under the condition of adhering to the public ownership of basic means of production, through the household contract responsibility system and various forms of socialized services, peasant households can accommodate modernized and socialized productive forces, and will be able to take a path of socialist agricultural modernization with Chinese characteristics. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, all undertakings in China's rural areas have achieved great achievements, and among these achievements, the most important is that we have, through exploration and experimentation, found a path suitable to China's national conditions to realize the modernization of socialist agriculture, and both the leadership and the masses have accumulated experience. We believe that as long as we continue to implement the line, principles, and policies of reform and opening up formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, unite as one, strive for progress, and firmly move forward along the path that has been opened up, China's rural areas will definitely become more prosperous and flourishing.

    社会主义道路与我国农业的发展
    陆学艺
    建国40年来，我国农业的发展取得了惊人的成就。根本的经验是，中国共产党领导广大农民，沿着有中国特色的社会主义道路前进，为农村的繁荣和发展开辟了广阔的天地。东方的奇迹——八亿农民得温饱，自给经济
    向商品经济转化。
    40年来，我国农村经济的发展经历了以下几个发展阶段。
    一、从1949年到1958年，我国农村经济蓬勃发展。农业生产连续9年增产，农民收入有很大增加，农民生活得到普遍改善。
    二、从1959年到1966年，农村经济发展走着曲折的路。1958年下半年，由于发动大跃进运动，大办人民公社，否定商品生产，否定按劳分配原则，损害了广大农民的利益，挫伤了农民的生产积极性，加上自然灾害，农业连续三年大减产，全国出现了三年经济困难。1962年，国家提出了调整、巩固、充实、提高的方针，到1966年全国大多数地区的农业生产恢复或超过了1957年的水平。
    三、从1967年到1976年，文革动乱波及农村，大批“三自一包”，搞穷过渡，割资本主义尾巴，没收自留地，限制家庭副业，关闭农贸市场，农村经济、农业生产长期徘徊不前。
    四、从1978年到现在，农村实行改革，农业得到巨大发展。党的十一届三中全会制定了《关于加快农业发展的决定》
  （草案），提出了农村改革和发展的25条政策，调整工农关系，增加农业投资，提高农副产品的收购价格，在农村推行家庭联产承包责任制，改革了集体经济经营管理形式，加上其它一系列有利于加快农村经济发展的措施，极大地调动了8亿农民的生产积极性，推动了农业生产和农村经济的全面发展，我国农村发生了历史性的变化。1984年，粮食增加到4073亿公斤，比1977年的2827亿公斤增长44％，平均每年递增5.4％；棉花总产由4098万担增加到12516万担，增长2.05倍，平均每年递增17.3％；农业总产值由1253亿元增加到3214亿元，扣除物价因素，增长69％，平均每年递增7.8％。
    1985年，中央明确提出调整农村产业结构，积极发展多种经营的方针。自此，农村的乡镇企业在各地发展得更快。1987年，乡镇企业的总产值超过农业总产值，成为农村重要的经济支柱。乡镇企业的突起，为农村剩余劳力找到了出路，促进了农村商品经济的发展。但是，由于城乡经济都向工业倾斜，某些措施失当，1985年粮棉减产后，农业出现了新的徘徊。
      40年来，虽然我国农村发展经历了比较曲折的道路，但在党和人民政府领导下，依靠社会主义制度的优越性，依靠广大农村干部和亿万农民群众的艰苦奋斗，我国的农业还是取得了极其巨大的成就，成绩斐然，举世瞩目。
      一、旧中国的农民处于受压迫受剥削又分散无组织的状况，通过土地改革，使农民成了土地的主人，又通过合作社组织集体经济，走上了社会主义道路。1978年以后，实行联产承包责任制，创造了符合中国国情的在社会主义公有制条件下，实现农业的专业化、商品化和现代化的好形式。
      二、旧中国的农业是使用落后工具手工操作的传统农业，新中国成立后，我们在进行农村社会改革的同时，对农业进行技术改造，大规模兴修水利，进行农田基本建设，建立了门类比较齐全的农用工业，发展农业科学技术，在全国范围内建立了农业科学技术的教学、研究推广体系，使传统农业在向现代农业的转变过程中迈进了一大步。1988年，全国已拥有大中型拖拉机87万台，小型及手扶拖拉机595万台，农机总动力为2.65亿马力，机耕面积占耕地总面积42.5％，有效灌溉面积占总耕地46.1％，每亩施用化肥14.8公斤，每亩耕地用电49.3度，农业现代化水平大大提高了。
      三、旧中国的农村产业结构单一，是自给半自给的自然经济，1952年农产品的商品率只有30.5％，直到1978年也只提高到39％。十一届三中全会以后，党中央明确提出调整农村产品结构，开展多种经营。现在的农村，不仅农林牧副渔全面发展，而且工业、建筑业、运输业、商业服务业也蓬勃发展起来，出现了农村经济繁荣兴旺的局面。1988年，农产品的商品率达到51.1％，农村的工农业产品的商品率为68.8％。整个农村经济正在由自然经济向有计划的商品经济转化。
    四、农村生产关系的改革和技术改造的推动，促进了我国农业生产和农村经济的全面发展。1988年，全国农业总产值5865亿元，按可比价格计算，比1949年增长5.1倍，平均每年递增4.8％，其中，种植业增长3.5倍，林业增长27倍，畜牧业增长7.8倍，渔业增长77倍。从1950年到1984年，全世界粮食总产增长167％，平均每年递增2.93％，同期我国粮食总产增长208％，平均每年递增3.37％。1950年，我国粮食总产占世界粮食总产16.6％，而1984年已占21.6％。我国的耕地只占世界总耕地的7％，却解决了占世界22％的人口的吃饭问题，这是中国农业的一项突出的成就。
    五、旧中国的大多数农民生活贫困，“糠菜半年粮”。随着农村经济的发展，农民生活得到了普遍改善。1988年，全国农民人均收入545元，绝大多数农民已经解决了温饱问题，约40％的农民摆脱了贫穷的困扰，温饱有余，约10％的农民已经先富起来，年均收入在1000元以上，过上了富裕的小康生活。
    六、40年来，农民为国家的社会主义建设作出了巨大贡献。从1952年到1988年的36年间，农民累计向国家交售粮食21526亿公斤，平均每年598亿公斤，交售棉花161240万担，每年4358万担，交售植物油119640万担，平均每年3234万担，还交售了许多其它农副产品，基本上保证了国民经济的发展和全国人民生活的需要。
    中国农村的40年，是我们党按照马克思主义普遍真理，改革、完善农村生产关系，促进农村生产力发展的四十年；是我们党领导亿万农民坚持走社会主义道路，并使之不断完善和发展的四十年。改革的曙光——找到适合中国国情的农业社会主义道路
    40年来，我国在农村生产关系的发展完善上，主要是进行了三项具有深远意义的重大改革。
    第一项是土地改革。建国以后我们根据土地改革法，在广大新解放区深入发动群众，没收地主的土地，无偿分配给无地少地的农民，废除了封建剥削的土地制度，实现了农民个体所有的土地制度。实践证明，这场伟大的土地改革运动是成功的，促进了农业生产，促进了社会的安定和发展，为农业的合作化作了思想上的准备。
    第二项是农业合作化。我国的农业合作化是在马克思主义的合作理论下，根据我国的国情分步骤进行的，符合生产力发展的要求，方向是正确的。农村实行基本生产资料公有制，使亿万农民走上了社会主义道路。在公有制的基础上，进行了空前规模的农田水利基本建设，科学种田和农业现代化都有了很大进展，到1978年积累了约为1000多亿元的公共财产，农业生产力有了很大提高。特别重要的是8亿农民取得了参加合作经济实践的经验，培养了一大批有经营管理能力的干部和人才，为后来的进一步改革准备了物质和精神的条件。对于我国五十年代的农业合作化，从全局看其历史作用应该充分肯定，这的确是伟大的历史性胜利。但是，在农业合作化的过程中，1955年夏季以后，一度要求过急，工作过粗，改变过快，形式上也过于简单划一，无论是高级合作社，还是后来的“三级所有，队为基础”，都是实行过分集中的经营管理体制，不能很好地适应中国农业的特点。这就在很大程度上抵销了国家对农业的巨大投入和亿万农民付出的艰苦劳动，没有得到应有的经济效益和社会效益，使农业生产长期得不到预期的发展。
      第三项重大改革就是实行家庭联产承包责任制。十一届三中全会以后，党中央顺应民意，尊重群众的创造精神，在全国普遍推行了家庭联产承包责任制。联产承包责任制的实行，为我们从实际出发，既继承20多年来农业合作化的积极成果，又克服集体经济经营管理集中过多等弊病找到了一条道路。实行联产承包责任制的实质是，使生产资料的所有权和经营管理权适当分离。土地等主要生产资料的所有权不变，仍是社会主义集体所有制，但通过承包，实行统分结合，把经营管理权分解为集体统一经营和农民家庭分散经营两个层次，宜统则统，宜分则分。这样，既能发挥社会主义集体经济统一经营的优越性，又使广大农民有了分散经营的自主权，能够充分发挥家庭经营的积极性，更适合我国农业生产的特点，更符合目前我国农业生产力水平，更符合广大农民群众的愿望。这就克服了原来集体经济的诸多弊端，解决了一些长期没有解决好的问题，从而大大促进了农业生产的发展，促进了农村多项事业的发展。
      实行联产承包制和一系列农村的改革政策，社会主义道路更加适合我国的具体情况，使社会主义制度的优越性更加得到发挥。农民的生产积极性一年比一年高，农业生产的形势一年比一年好，农村形势好转之快，发展之迅速，超过了许多人的预料，国内国外一片称颂。
    发展的前景
    ——农村潜力很大，悲观论没有根据
    在1984年农业获得了空前的全面丰收之后，1985年粮食、棉花减产，从此，农业出现了新的徘徊问题。
      怎样看待这几年出现的农业徘徊呢？有的同志认为，近几年的农业徘徊，主要是联产承包制不灵了，农业要有新突破，只有采取新的经营形式，这种看法是脱离实际的。这几年之所以发生农业徘徊，主要不是联产承包责任制的问题。而是农村改革初见成效之后，有些同志对农业形势估计过于乐观，误以为农业已经过关，放松了对农业的领导和支持，把力量向工业倾斜，大量削减农业和农用工业的投资，致使水利失修，农机老化，农业的物质技术基础削弱，化肥、农药短缺，价格暴涨，农业生产成本增大，而粮棉等主要农产品的收购价格没有相应调整，农业生产的比较利益下降，挫伤了农民从事农业生产特别是粮棉生产的积极性，这是发生农业徘徊的主要原因。所以，把农业徘徊归咎于联产承包制的说法是不符合事实的。恰恰相反，联产承包制还是这几年农业没有大滑波和保持农村社会稳定的基本因素。联产承包制适合目前我国农村生产力水平，符合农民的意愿和利益，不根据具体条件，企图现在就改变联产承包制谋求农业新发展的想法是危险的。事实上，只要真正加强对农业的领导和支持，调整国民经济格局，改变工业过热、农业过冷的状况，按照价值规律，调整价格政策，减轻农民负担，进一步发挥联产承包制的作用，把广大农民的生产积极性重新调动起来，目前农业徘徊的局面是不难扭转的。
      有的同志认为，“我国人口不断增加，耕地日趋减少”，而“小农经济的潜力已经耗尽”，供给有限，提出今后要长期进口粮食的看法。这也是不正确的。我国人口多，人均耕地资源少，这是事实。在现阶段，国家经济实力还不强，农田基本建设和农用工业还不够，抗御自然灾害的能力还不足，因此，盲目乐观、认为农业过关、不抓紧农业生产和建设的想法和做法是错误的，但也不应该因此得出悲观的结论。我国农业增产的潜力还很大，农业发展的前景是有希望的。这是因为：首先，据科学院自然资源综考会多年的量算，我国现在实有耕地20亿亩，而不是14.35亿亩。几个部局的专家们测算，即使到2000年，仍将保有19亿亩以上的耕地。1984年，我国粮食总产量占世界第一位，但亩产只有509斤，占世界第18位。如按实际面积计算，亩产还要低，位次还要后。在现有耕地中，2／3是中低产田，增产潜力还很大。何况我国还有很多的荒山荒坡荒滩可资利用。其二，我国农业科技的潜力更大。我们已有了一支训练有素、力量雄厚的农业科技队伍，农村改革以来，农业科研有了突破性的进展，在育种、栽培、配方施肥、防治病虫害等方面都有重大成就，有的已处于国际领先水平。只要条件成熟，现有科研成果得到推广应用，农业增产几成，粮食再上几个台阶是可以实现的。其三，我国的农用工业还大有文章可做。现在每年因缺少化肥、农药、农膜、农机、柴油、电力而造成减产的数字非常可观，如果农用工业经过调整、提高，能够满足供应优质的农用工业品，农业就能达到一个新的高度。其四，我们有一支勤劳俭朴、有精耕细作传统的庞大的农业劳动力队伍，广大农民在党的领导下，发挥社会主义制度的优越性，已经创造了许多农业发展的奇迹。只要我们今后的政策得当，把亿万农民的积极性进一步调动起来，还能创造出更多农业发展的奇迹。总之，我国农业发展的前景是可观的，悲观的、眼睛向外的观点是不足取的。前进的道路——稳定和完善联产承包制，家庭经营同
    社会化服务相结合
    联产承包制作为农村生产关系的调整、集体经济经营管理体制的重大改革，是我国首创的、特有的，但它本身需要稳定和进一步完善。一是要稳定和完善家庭承包这个层次，要搞好土地的发包和承包的合同，坚持土地承包期15年不变，增强农民对政策的稳定感，激励农民自觉增加农业投入，尊重农民生产经营的自主权，充分发挥家庭经营的积极性，这是农村的大政策；二是要充实加强村一级的领导和经济实力，搞好农业生产的产前产中产后的社会化服务；三是要对县乡两级的政治经济管理体制、流通体制、科技体制等作相应改革，使之配套协调。做好这三个层次的工作，就能促使新的农村经营管理的体制臻于完善，充分发挥其促进生产力发展的作用。
      就目前来说，农村工作要重点抓好村级组织的整顿和建设，搞好农业生产的社会化服务。联产承包制的基本特点是统分结合、双层经营。现在的农业生产，已经不是自给自足的小农经济，单靠一家一户是不行了，需要机耕，需要灌溉，需要化肥、农药的供应等产前产后的服务。而这是一家一户办不了、办不好、办不经济的，需要集体经济统一经营、提供服务。但在相当多的农村，这几年，农民家庭经营的积极性是发挥了，而集体经济的统一经营的优越性却没有得到应有的发挥。据民政部调查，全国约有20％左右的村级组织处于瘫痪状态和半瘫痪状态，有的省区则为30％—50％，不能发挥统一经营的作用。农民自家种田，得不到集体的帮助，农业生产当然要受到很大的影响。在这方面，统分结合，搞得好的典型也很多。黑龙江省肇东市就是一个好的例子。这个市60万农业人口，1985年产粮4.5亿公斤，向国家交售1.6亿公斤，1988年产粮8.8亿公斤，交售4.04亿公斤，今年可产粮9—9.5亿公斤，可交售5亿公斤。仅仅四年功夫，粮食产量翻了一番，向国家贡献增加二倍多。靠什么？基本经验是两条，一是领导思想端正，坚持把农业放在第一位，各行各业支援农业，坚持农田水利建设，坚持科学种田，改善生产条件；二是充分发挥集体和农民两个积极性，农民承包，家庭经营，这同全国是一样的；另外，全市326个村，每个村的集体经济都能提供很好的产前产中产后服务，统一机耕，统一灌溉，统一购买化肥、良种、农药，有的村还把化肥直接送到地头，充分发挥了社会主义集体经济统一经营的优越性。这个材料说明，不是联产承包责任制的潜力已经耗尽，而是还有很多的工作要做。我们要尽力去完善和发展这个中国农民群众创造的好形式，充分发挥它在农村发展中的作用。
      近几年农业徘徊之后，联产承包制只是权宜之计的议论重又泛起，有的同志笼统提出要寻找新的经济形式的主张，这些观点是不妥当的。长期形成的传统看法认为：大生产比小生产优越，把大生产又单纯理解为规模的扩大，在一个劳动场所的人力物力大量集中；把社会化大生产和家庭经营对立起来，认为家庭经营同现代化农业生产是不相容的。国内外的实践表明，农业生产适宜于家庭经营，在经济发达国家，家庭经营仍然是现代化农业的重要的经营形式。
      我国联产承包制近十年来的实践，已向我们展示了家庭经营同社会化大生产结合的图景。实行联产承包制，农民成为独立的商品生产者，商品生产积极性空前高涨，商品生产的发展促进了产业结构的调整，促进了社会分工，促进了专业化，有一部分农民会转到二三产业去，还有一部分农民会去从事农机、植保等专业服务，只要其它社会条件成熟，他们就会放弃土地去从事其它产业。这样，直接从事农业生产的农户就会大量减少，而他的经营规模就可以相应扩大，效益和收入就会大幅度提高。这样，经营农业的家庭实际上是整个社会生产链条上的一个环节，归入社会化大生产的协作体系中。近年来，一些地区实行的适度规模经营试点，效果是好的。而他们仍是采取家庭承包、双层经营的形式。当然，目前在全国大多数地区的农村还达不到那样的条件，还要有一个创造条件的过程。但是，从这些试验典型，就可以看到，在坚持土地等基本生产资料公有制的条件下，通过联产承包制，通过各种形式的社会化服务，农民的家庭经营可以容纳现代化、社会化生产力，将会走出一条具有中国特色的社会主义农业现代化的道路来。
    40年来，我国农村的各项事业，在中国共产党的领导下，已经取得了伟大成就，而在这些成就中，最重要的是我们经过探索、试验，找到了一条适合我国国情的、实现社会主义农业现代化的道路，领导和群众都积累了经验。我们相信，只要继续贯彻十一届三中全会制定的改革开放的路线、方针、政策，齐心协力，奋发图强，沿着已经开辟的道路坚定地走下去，我国的农村一定会更加繁荣昌盛。
