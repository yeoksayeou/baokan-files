People gaze at luxury goods with the same astonishment that Siu Ma Ma from "Dream of the Red Chamber" had when she first saw the Grand View Garden. These goods are spectacular. The gazes are regretful.

Color TVs, stereo systems, refrigerators, and combination audio systems have been hot sellers for many years. But buying a suit for the price of a 14-inch color TV, a pair of sneakers or a lighter for the price of a stereo system, or a watch for the price of an imported combination audio system or several refrigerators, is a recent phenomenon.

Nowadays, from suits to belts, everything is moving towards luxury. But this does not equate to price increases. The price differences in stores are stark. Inside a trading company near Beijing's Xuanwu Gate, the most expensive pair of sports shoes costs 300 yuan, while the cheapest is only 3 yuan. In the Hengdeli Watch Store on Xidan, a Swiss-made Radar perpetual calendar watch priced at 13,400 yuan sits next to a 9.5 yuan plastic-cased electronic watch on the same counter.

You get what you pay for. Each imported Armani belt, priced at 230 yuan, is far superior in terms of the shine of the buckle and the softness of the leather compared to a 30 yuan knockoff. In front of a pair of Italian-made leather shoes priced at 750 yuan, domestic shoes priced at a few dozen yuan pale in comparison in terms of comfort.

According to the business department of Beijing's Longfu Department Store, this year, the store imported a batch of luxury watches. In just one month, two watches priced over 10,000 yuan were sold, ten watches priced between 6,000 and 7,000 yuan were sold, and six watches priced over 2,000 yuan were sold, accounting for more than half of the inventory. It is said that most of these consumers are individual business owners. They are the first to get rich, spending money without batting an eye.

But this is a small minority. "The vast majority can only afford practicality, not fashion," said the department head, Liang. "Like me, I have to think twice before buying a suit that costs over a hundred yuan."

A friend went to the Lisheng Sports Goods Store and immediately fell in love with a vest. But upon seeing the price, he quickly changed his mind. It was priced at 120 yuan, exceeding his monthly salary. Later, he shook his head and sighed, "There's nothing I can do."

This spectacle of luxury goods, which seems both fascinating and regrettable, is the mainstream sentiment. It is common to see couples whispering in front of luxury goods displays for a long time, then reluctantly walking away, looking back several times.

"In my opinion, the price of a commodity is related to the amount of money in my pocket," said young writer Wang Shuo. "If I only have 10 yuan, then an 8 yuan commodity is expensive. If I have 100 yuan, then a 20 yuan commodity is not expensive." When making a purchasing plan, one should first consider the contents of their wallet and not just wishful thinking.

This can be considered a very realistic consumption view at the current primary stage.

### 高档商品：很精彩但无奈

    高档商品：很精彩但无奈
    王岳龙　冯瑛冰
    人们以《红楼梦》中刘姥姥一样的目光注视着高档商品的“大观园”。这商品是精彩的。这目光是无奈的。
    彩电、收录机、冰箱和组合音响已热销多年。而用相当于一台14英寸彩电的价钱去买一套西装，用相当于一台收录机的钱去买一双球鞋或一只打火机，用相当于一台进口组合音响或几台冰箱的钱去买一块手表，还是近几年的事。
    而今，大到西装，小到腰带，无不走向高档。但这绝不等同于物价上涨。商店内高低反差明显。北京宣武门内一家贸易商行里，运动鞋最贵的300元，最贱的才3元。在西单亨得利钟表店，标价1.34万元的瑞士雷达永不磨损型日历男表，与9.5元一块的塑料壳电子表身处同样的柜台。
    一分钱一分货。每条230元的进口花花公子牌腰带，与30元一条的仿造品，无论是签子的光亮度还是皮子的柔韧性，都不可同日而语。在750元一双的意大利产皮鞋面前，几十元一双的国产鞋的“脚感”确乎黯然失色。
    据北京隆福大厦业务部梁科长等工作人员介绍，今年年初，这家商场进了一批高档手表，仅一个月，万元以上的售出2块，六七千元的售出10块，2000元以上的售出6块，占进货量的一半强。据介绍，这部分消费豪客，以个体经营者居多。他们是首先致富的一批，甩出大把票子连眉头都不皱。
    但这是极少数。“绝大多数求不起时髦只求实惠。”梁科长说，“像我，连买套上百元的衣服都需掂量再三。”
    一位朋友逛到利生体育用品商店，进门便看中一件背心，及瞧清价格，赶紧打消了购买的念头。它标价120元，超过此君一个月的工资。事后说起，他摇头叹声“没辙”。
    这种看来精彩又觉无奈的心态占主流。经常可见小两口在高档商品柜前嘀咕半天，然后一步三回头，依依不舍地别去。
    “在我看来，一件商品的贵贱和我兜里的钱数有关。”青年作家王朔说过，“我只有10块钱，那么8块钱的商品都贵。如果我有100块钱，那么20块钱的同样商品都不贵。”制定购货计划时，确应先掂掂自己的钱袋，不能仅凭一厢情愿。
    这可算作目前初级阶段非常现实的消费观了。
