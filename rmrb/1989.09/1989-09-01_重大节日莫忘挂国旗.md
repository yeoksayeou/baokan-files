Yesterday, primary and secondary schools in Beijing reopened, and all held solemn flag-raising ceremonies. Seeing the high-flying five-star red flag, a sense of pride as a Chinese person naturally arises.

It is only natural to hang the national flag on major holidays, memorial days, or important ceremonies. However, in recent years, during holidays such as "May 1" and "October 1," some enterprises, shops, villages, schools, and even government agencies have "forgotten" to hang the national flag. Whether it is because there are no flags, they cannot be bought, or it is simply overlooked, it is unknown. But one thing is certain: this "forgetting" should not have happened. Does this not indicate to some extent that some comrades' sense of patriotism has become somewhat diluted?

The five-star red flag is dyed with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. As our republic's national flag, it symbolizes the dignity of our socialist motherland. Hanging the five-star red flag is itself a form of patriotic education. Unfortunately, some comrades do not understand the need for this kind of education. A document reveals: a farmer in a certain village in Subei does not know what the national flag looks like and uses it as a sign for a liquor shop; a school that has been evaluated as an advanced unit multiple times has 45% of its students who cannot draw the national flag, and 97% of the students who cannot explain the origin and meaning of the national flag. These ordinary people and young students have such a lack of knowledge about the national flag, indicating that education in this area is severely lacking and urgently needs to be supplemented in strengthening patriotic education.

A leading comrade from the central government recently emphasized that this year's National Day has unusual significance, and we should seize this excellent opportunity to do a good job in propaganda work. I think that regardless of whether it is in cities, villages, inland areas, or border regions, every unit should solemnly and ceremoniously raise the national flag during holidays, so that everyone can see the high-flying five-star red flag and think of the brilliant achievements made in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the 10 years of reform and opening up. This will arouse a sense of national pride and further inspire a sense of responsibility to achieve the Four Modernizations and revitalize China.

    重大节日莫忘挂国旗
    周驿
    昨天，北京市中、小学开学，都举行了隆重的升国旗仪式。看着高高飘扬的五星红旗，作为中国人的一种自豪感油然而生。
    重大节日、纪念日或重要仪式挂国旗，本属理所当然的事。然而，近些年的“五·一”、“十·一”等节日，一些企业、商店、乡村、学校，甚至机关，都有“忘记”悬挂国旗的情况。是没有国旗，买不到国旗，还是疏忽了？不得而知。但有一点可以肯定，这是不应该发生的“忘记”。这是否多多少少说明有些同志的爱国观念有些淡漠了呢？
    五星红旗是用无数革命先烈的鲜血染成的，她作为我们共和国的国旗，象征着社会主义祖国的尊严。挂五星红旗，本身就是一种爱国主义教育。遗憾的是有些同志不懂得应进行这方面的教育。案头有份材料披露：苏北某乡一农民不知国旗何样，竟当作酒幌；一个数次被评为先进的学校，百分之四十五的学生画不出国旗图案，百分之九十七的学生说不出国旗的来历和含义。这些普通群众和青少年对有关国旗的知识如此贫乏，说明这方面的教育太欠缺了，亟需在加强爱国主义教育中补上这一课。
    中央一位领导同志最近强调，今年的国庆具有不同寻常的意义，要抓住这个极好机会，做好宣传工作。我想，不论城市、乡村、内地、边疆，每个单位都应该在过节时庄严、隆重地升起国旗，让大家看到高高飘扬的五星红旗，就想到建国四十年来特别是改革开放十年来取得的光辉成就，从而唤起民族自豪感，进一步激发实现四化、振兴中华的责任感。
