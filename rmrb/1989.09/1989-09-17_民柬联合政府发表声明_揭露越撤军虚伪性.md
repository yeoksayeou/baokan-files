The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea issued a statement tonight in Bangkok, pointing out that after Vietnam's unilateral troop withdrawal this September, 100,000 to 130,000 Vietnamese soldiers, disguised as Phnom Penh's puppet troops or militia, have remained in Cambodia.

The statement was jointly signed by the Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, Son Sann, the Vice Chairman of Democratic Kampuchea in charge of foreign affairs, Khieu Samphan, and Prince Norodom Sihanouk's personal representative in Cambodia and Asia, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, on September 12.

The statement said that Vietnam announced a unilateral troop withdrawal but blatantly refused effective United Nations supervision of the withdrawal, forcing many countries to doubt its intention behind the unilateral troop withdrawal.

The statement pointed out that Vietnam's fundamental purpose in opposing the establishment of a four-party provisional government in Cambodia led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to preserve the Phnom Penh puppet regime at all costs, in order to cover up the truth of its military presence in Cambodia.

The statement also called on the three factions of the Cambodian resistance forces to work together in unity and fight side by side until all Vietnamese invaders are expelled.

The statement finally appealed to all justice-loving and peace-loving countries in the world to continue supporting the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese resistance cause and to continue pressuring Vietnam until it accepts a comprehensive political settlement on the Cambodian issue.

    民柬联合政府发表声明
　　揭露越撤军虚伪性
    新华社曼谷9月15日电　民柬联合政府今晚在此间发表声明指出，今年9月越南“单方面撤军”后，仍有10万至13万越南军人化装成金边伪军或民兵在柬埔寨潜伏下来。
    这项声明是由民柬联合政府总理宋双、负责外交事务的民主柬埔寨副主席乔森潘和西哈努克亲王驻柬埔寨和亚洲私人代表拉那烈王子9月12日联合签署的。
    声明说，越南宣布“单方面撤军”，但公然拒绝联合国对撤军进行有效监督，这迫使许多国家对它宣布的“单方面撤军”的意图产生怀疑。
    声明指出，越南反对成立以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨四方临时政府的根本目的是企图不惜一切代价，保住金边伪政权，以便掩盖它在柬埔寨驻军的真相。
    声明还号召民柬抵抗力量三方爱国武装力量的官兵精诚合作，协同作战，直到赶走所有的越南侵略者。
    声明最后还呼吁世界上所有主持正义、爱好和平的国家继续支持柬埔寨抗越正义事业，并向越南继续施加压力，直至它接受关于柬埔寨问题的全面政治解决协议。
