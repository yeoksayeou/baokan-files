	Li Tieying

	Comrades and friends,

	In the days when the autumn breeze is refreshing and harvests are imminent, we are gathered on the land of Songliao to welcome a grand event in China's sports arena this year—the opening of the Second National Youth Games. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to the conference! I would like to express my cordial greetings to the delegations from 36 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, the People's Liberation Army, and industry sports associations across the country. I would also like to express my warm welcome to the guests from all walks of life, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, overseas Chinese, and international friends who have come to observe the event. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the staff, referees, and volunteers who have worked tirelessly to ensure the smooth running of the conference.

	Currently, after suppressing the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary rebellion, our country has restored normal political and social order. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country are earnestly implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhering to the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and striving to build our country with a united spirit. In this context, the holding of the Youth Games will play a positive role in strengthening spiritual civilization, promoting social stability and unity, and boosting the morale of the people.

	During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the various sports events of the Second Youth Games were in the midst of their heats. Our sports teams passed the test, and the competition organizing units and athletes overcame difficulties and interference to ensure the smooth completion of all events. They not only demonstrated excellent sports skills but also showed high political and ideological qualities. Liaoning Province, as the host of this conference, has not stopped its preparations for a single day, providing good conditions for the smooth running of the conference. The timely holding of the Second Youth Games is the result of the joint efforts of the sports front under the correct guidance of the Party Central Committee.

	The Party and the government, as well as the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, have always attached great importance to and cared for youth sports. Holding the National Youth Games is a strategic measure to cultivate outstanding reserve talents for climbing the world sports peak and better implement the Party's educational policy to cultivate all-round talents with moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, and labor qualities. Sports are an important part of school education. Youth sports focus on primary and secondary schools. All levels and types of schools across the country should attach great importance to and comprehensively strengthen sports work. The whole society should also give full attention and support. Youths are in the prime of their lives, a crucial stage for establishing a correct worldview, acquiring rich knowledge, and building a strong physique. Youths are the future and hope of the motherland. Cultivating qualified young talents is the fundamental guarantee for the prosperity and development of the socialist cause. We believe that through the holding of the Youth Games, it will promote the development of youth sports, accelerate the pace of China's sports towards the world level, and contribute to the realization of the goal of a strong sports nation.

	To all athletes, coaches, and referees, the competition curtain has been raised. I hope that the young athletes will inherit and carry forward the good sports moral style of tenacious struggle and active progress, compete with style and level, and produce a batch of outstanding talents. I hope that the coaches and referees will uphold the spirit of fair competition and teamwork, ensure the quality of the competition. I hope that all comrades will unite as one, carry forward the fine style of hard work and thrift, and make this conference a grand, solemn, thrifty, high-quality, and efficient sports event. With outstanding results, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	Finally, I wish the Second National Youth Games a complete success!
