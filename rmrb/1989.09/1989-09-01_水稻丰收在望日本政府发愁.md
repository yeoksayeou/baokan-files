Japan's rice crop is looking good this year, with a bumper harvest in sight. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is deeply troubled by this prospect.

Every year, the Japanese government buys rice from farmers at high prices and then sells it at low prices in the market. This has long been a thorny issue for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Agriculture is a traditional voting base for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and the government fears losing the support of farmers, so it has no choice but to buy their rice at a loss. To solve this problem, the ministry has to limit the area of rice cultivation. In extreme cases, the government even buys the young rice plants in the fields and then destroys them.

The ministry is now worried that if this year's rice production increases by 3% compared to last year, the area of rice cultivation next year will have to be reduced by another 60,000 hectares, bringing the total reduced area to 900,000 hectares. How can this reduction task be distributed among farmers across the country?

In the recent House of Councillors election, the Liberal Democratic Party lost many seats, partly due to its flawed agricultural policies, which drew opposition from farmers. Facing the upcoming House of Representatives election, the Liberal Democratic Party naturally does not want to further alienate farmers, making the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries stuck in a dilemma.

    水稻丰收在望日本政府发愁
    日本今年水稻长势良好，丰收在望。但农林水产省对此正大感头痛。
    每年日本政府高价收购农民的大米，然后以低价投入市场。这一直是农林水产省深感棘手的问题。农林是执政的自民党传统的“票田”，政府害怕失掉农民的支持，因此不得不忍痛购买他们的大米。为了解决这一难题，农林水产省只好限制种植水稻面积。在不得已的情况下，政府还花钱购买地里的青苗，然后毁掉。
    农林水产省正在发愁，今年水稻如果比去年增产3％，那么明年的种植面积就要再减6万公顷，总减种面积达90万公顷。这么多的减种任务，如何派在全国农民的头上？
    在前不久的参院选举中，自民党丢了不少席位，原因之一是农业政策不当，遭到农民反对。今后面临众院选举的自民党自然是不愿进一步去得罪农民，而这更使农林水产省欲进不得，欲罢不能。　（新华社）
