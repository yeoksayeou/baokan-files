Before the founding of New China, many minority nationalities had virtually no schools at all. Some minority nationalities' education was primarily concentrated in religious temples, with education and religious belief intertwined. From content to form, everything bore the imprint of theology. Only a few minority nationalities, due to the direct or indirect influence of capitalism, had a limited number of modern-style schools. Consequently, only a few people received an education, while the children of the vast majority of laboring masses were often excluded from school due to their living conditions.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, due to the care and attention of the Party and the state, numerous effective policies and measures have been implemented, leading to unprecedented historical development in minority nationality education. A basic system of education has been established, integrating socialist content with national forms, and possessing certain characteristics. Significant achievements have been made.

- The number of minority nationality students in schools at all levels has increased significantly. In 1988, compared to 1951, the number of students increased from 990,000 to 12,927,000, a 12-fold increase. Among these, the number of students in regular higher education institutions increased from 2,117 to 125,400, a 58-fold increase; the number of students in secondary technical schools increased from 660 to 88,200, a 132.6-fold increase; the number of students in secondary normal schools increased from 4,531 to 61,700, a 12.6-fold increase; the number of students in regular middle schools increased from 40,316 to 2,816,400, a 68.8-fold increase; the number of students in primary schools increased from 943,285 to 9,835,500, a 9.4-fold increase.

- The rapid development of minority nationality higher education is an important sign that our national education has entered a new historical stage. Before the founding of New China, there were almost no higher education institutions in minority nationality areas, and even those who went to study in higher education institutions in the interior were very few. Now, there are more than 100 regular higher education institutions nationwide that primarily enroll and cultivate minority nationality students, significantly changing the extremely unreasonable distribution of higher education institutions in our country and enhancing the ability of national regions to cultivate multi-level, multi-disciplinary socialist senior construction talents.

- Various forms of secondary vocational and technical education have seen new developments. According to statistics from the five autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, by 1987, secondary vocational schools had developed to 361, nearly 7 times the 46 in 1950, initially solving the need for local cultivation of various intermediate talents in these regions. At the same time, during the 10 years of reform and opening up, with the deepening of the reform of the secondary education structure, vocational agricultural middle schools in national regions have also seen new developments. By 1988, the number of minority nationality students in vocational agricultural middle schools nationwide had reached 263,900, a 3.3-fold increase from 61,690 in 1984, achieving significant development.

- Boarding minority nationality primary and secondary schools have become an important form of developing basic education in minority nationality mountainous and pastoral areas. Mountainous and pastoral areas are vast and sparsely populated, with scattered residences, especially pastoral areas where nomadic life is predominant, and seasonal migrations are common. This requires centralized schooling, and primary and secondary schools must adopt a boarding system. Currently, there are more than 5,000 boarding primary and secondary schools in minority nationality mountainous and pastoral areas, with over 1 million students. The state and local governments have implemented a scholarship system for boarding students, and for students from impoverished families, tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, and textbooks are provided free of charge. By the end of 1988, there were more than 200 national counties that had achieved universal primary education, accounting for about 1/3 of the total number of national counties in the country.

- The development of various educational undertakings in national regions has cultivated a large number of cadres and various intermediate and senior specialized talents. For example, by 1988, there were more than 625,700 minority nationality teachers teaching on the front lines of various levels of schools, an increase of more than 10 times compared to the early days of the founding of the nation.

- In national schools, the "bilingual" teaching system of learning both the national language and literature and Chinese is actively implemented. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Jilin, Qinghai, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan have established institutions for compiling and publishing teaching materials. Every year, a large number of teaching materials, teaching outlines, teaching reference books, and other teaching materials in various national languages are compiled and published. According to statistics from the past 10 years, using nearly 30 national languages, the average annual number of compiled and published primary and secondary school, secondary normal school teaching materials, and teaching reference books is 1,800, with a print run of 80 million copies.

- Education support to border areas has been further strengthened and expanded. There are various forms of support and cooperation in higher education alone, such as establishing national classes in higher education institutions in the interior, sending teachers to teach and lecture in higher education institutions in remote national regions, or accepting teachers from national region higher education institutions to come for further study and improvement, supporting teaching equipment, instruments, books, and materials, as well as providing scientific and technological consulting services, and supporting the construction of higher education institutions in remote national regions with funds. The organized and planned education support to border areas has achieved good results.

　　少数民族教育的历史性发展
    新中国诞生之前，许多少数民族根本就没有任何意义上的学校教育。还有一些少数民族的教育基本上集中在宗教寺院，教育与宗教信仰合为一体，从教育内容到形式无不打上神学的印记。只有为数不多的少数民族，由于受到资本主义的直接或间接影响，才有了数量有限、层次比较低的近代意义的学校教育。因而受教育的只是少数人，广大劳动群众子女则由于生活所迫，常常被拒之于学校大门之外。
    建国40年来，由于党和国家的关怀和重视，采取了许多有效的政策和措施，使少数民族教育事业取得了前所未有的历史性发展，初步建立了从初等教育到高等教育、社会主义内容与民族形式相结合、具有一定特色的民族教育体系，取得了可喜的成就。
    ——各级学校少数民族在校生人数有很大的增长。1988年同建国初期的1951年相比，从99万人增加到1292.7万人，增长12倍。其中，普通高等学校在校生人数从2117人增加到125400人，增长58倍；中等技术学校在校生人数从660人增加到88200人，增长132.6倍；中等师范学校在校生人数从4531人增加到61700人，增长12.6倍；普通中学在校生人数从40316人增加到2816400人，增长68.8倍；小学在校生人数从943285人增加到9835.500人。增长9.4倍。
    ——少数民族高等教育得到迅速发展，是我国民族教育进入新的历史阶段的重要标志。新中国建立之前，在少数民族地区几乎没有一所高等学校，即使到内地上大学的少数民族学生也寥寥无几。而现在，全国以招收、培养少数民族学生为主的普通高等学校已达100余所，大大改变了我国高等学校地区分布极不合理的状况，增强了民族地区自身培养多层次、多专业的社会主义高级建设人才的能力。
    ——各种形式的中等职业技术教育有新的发展。仅据内蒙古、广西、西藏、宁夏、新疆等5个自治区统计，1987年中等专业学校已发展到361所，比1950年的46所增长近7倍，初步解决了这些地区就地培养各类中级人才的需要。同时，在实行改革、开放的10年中，随着中等教育结构改革的深入，民族地区农职业中学有了新的发展。1988年全国农职业中学的少数民族在校生人数已达263900人，比1984年的61690人增加3.3倍，取得较大发展。
  ——寄宿制民族中小学成为少数民族山区、牧区发展基础教育的重要形式。山区、牧区地广人稀，居住分散，尤其牧区以游牧为主，四季流动。这就需要集中办学，中小学必须实行寄宿制。目前，少数民族山区、牧区的寄宿制小学、中学已发展到5000余所，在校生人数已达100多万人。国家和地方对寄宿生普遍实行了助学金制度，对贫困家庭学生还免收学杂费并免费供应课本。到1988年年底已经普及初等教育的民族县达200余个，占全国民族县总数的1／3左右。
    ——民族地区各类教育事业的发展，为少数民族培养了一大批干部和各类中高级专门人才。其中，仅以教师为例，1988年在各级学校教学第一线任教的少数民族教师已达625700余人，比建国初期增长10余倍。
    ——在民族学校积极实行在学好本民族语文的同时学好汉文的“双语”教学制度。内蒙古、新疆、西藏、广西、吉林、青海、云南、贵州、四川等9个省、自治区均设有教材编译出版机构，每年都在大量编译出版各种民族文字的教材、教学大纲、教学参考书及其他教学用书。仅据近10年的统计，使用近30种少数民族文字编译出版的中小学、中等师范教材和教学参考书，每年平均1800种、印数达8000万册。
    ——教育支边工作进一步得到加强和扩大。仅高等教育方面的支援协作就有多种形式，如在内地高等院校举办民族班，选派教师到边远民族地区高等院校任课、讲学，或接受民族地区高等院校教师来校进修、提高，支援教学仪器设备图书资料等，以及开展科技咨询服务，在资金上支援边远民族地区高校建设等等，有组织、有计划的教育支边工作取得了良好的效果。
