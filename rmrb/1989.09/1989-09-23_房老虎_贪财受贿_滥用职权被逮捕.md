Jiangsu Huanan City People's Procuratorate

    The manager of our city's real estate company, He Fenglian, used his position to accept bribes totaling 9,634 yuan from construction teams in Nanjie Township, Linji Town, and other individuals. The manager's embezzlement and bribe-taking led his subordinates to follow suit. The general manager of the real estate development and operation division, Wang Zhengfa, also used his position to accept bribes totaling 7,800 yuan. On August 26, the Huai'an City People's Procuratorate lawfully arrested He Fenglian and Wang Zhengfa on charges of bribe-taking. These two former "house tigers," who once held so much power, are now prisoners.

    “房老虎”贪财受贿  滥用职权被逮捕
    我市房地产公司经理何凤连，利用职务之便，收受我市南闸乡、林集镇等建筑工程队及他人贿赂9634元。经理贪财受贿，部属随之效仿。市房地产公司经营开发股股长王正发也利用职务之便，受贿7800元。8月26日，淮安市人民检察院以受贿罪依法逮捕了何凤连和王正发。这两只昔日威风凛凛地“房老虎”，今朝成了“阶下囚”。
