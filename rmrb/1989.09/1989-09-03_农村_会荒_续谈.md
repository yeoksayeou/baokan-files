The "Today's Talk" column published an article on August 2 titled "Meeting Drought in Rural Areas," which mentioned that currently, necessary meetings in rural areas are not being held. I agree with this observation, but I feel there is more to discuss.

According to reports, the Ministry of Civil Affairs recently conducted a large-scale survey in seventeen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Guangxi, and Guizhou. The survey found that a significant portion of village-level governments are in a state of disarray. Only about one-third are in good condition, half can be considered average, and about one-fifth are in a state of disarray (with one-quarter completely paralyzed). In some remote mountainous areas of Guizhou Province, many villagers are even unaware of major policy adjustments and personnel changes by the state in recent years. This indicates that the "meeting drought" in rural areas is closely related to the disarray of village-level government organizations.

With the implementation of the responsibility system for production, some regions have lowered their requirements for rural cadres and reduced training. Major meetings that should be attended by village cadres are often not attended by some, and higher-level authorities do not strictly enforce this. Village cadres themselves are unaware of higher-level directives, so how can they implement and enforce them?

The "meeting drought" leads to a "policy drought." To ensure that central policies are promptly implemented in rural areas, county and township party committees must not only assign tasks but also ensure their implementation. Additionally, efforts should be made to improve the quality of rural grassroots cadres, think of some solutions, such as regularly training village cadres and regularly visiting villages to inspect the implementation of central policies in rural areas. If "hard targets" are set for this issue, the situation will definitely improve.

### 农村“会荒”续谈

    农村“会荒”续谈
    徐太勇
    “今日谈”专栏8月2日发表的《农村“会荒”》谈到，当前农村中该开的会议不开，笔者有同感，但又觉得言犹未尽。
    据报道，民政部前段时间对北京、天津、广西、贵州等十七个省、自治区、直辖市进行了大规模的调查，发现村级政权相当一部分处于涣散状态，好的只占三成，一半可称为一般，涣散状态的占二成左右（其中四分之一完全瘫痪）。贵州省个别边远山区，不少村民甚至连这几年国家重大的政策调整和人事更迭都不清楚。由此可以看出，农村闹“会荒”与这些村政权组织处于涣散状态有很大关系。
    现在实行了生产责任制，有些地区对农村干部的要求降低了，培训少了。有的重大会议的传达贯彻，本来要求村干部都参加，但有的村干部无所谓，不到会，上级也不去认真抓一抓。村干部本身就不知道上级精神，谈何贯彻落实呢？
      “会荒”带来“政策荒”。要保证中央政策在农村得到及时贯彻落实，县乡两级党委对下面各项工作不能只管布置，不抓落实。同时，也要从提高农村基层干部的素质入手，动些脑筋，想点办法，比如定期培训村干部，定期到乡村走一走，检查一下中央政策在农村的落实情况。在这个问题上如果也定些“硬指标”，情况肯定会好一些。
