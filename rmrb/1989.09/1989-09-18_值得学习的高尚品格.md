A few days ago, we recommended to our readers a report on the simple life of revolutionary veteran Comrade Zeng Zhi, titled "The True Colors of a Communist" (see the front page of this newspaper on September 9). Now, we recommend another article, "An Upright Judge." This piece introduces Liu Wenbiao, a middle-aged Communist Party member who has devoted himself to his duties as a judge, living a life of modest means. Comrade Liu Wenbiao's noble character, putting the interests of the Party and the people above his own, is deeply moving and reflects the spirit of Communist Party members in the new era, worthy of our learning.

The noble qualities of Comrade Zeng Zhi and the spirit of dedication of Comrade Liu Wenbiao vividly illustrate that resisting and opposing corruption is the true character and fine tradition of Chinese Communist Party members. This was relatively easy to achieve during the revolutionary war years. After seizing national power, the position of our Party has changed, and it is even more necessary for every Communist Party member to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work, simplicity, and clean governance. We must set an example for the people and lead the broad masses to complete various arduous tasks. Whether it is the older generation of Communist Party members or the new generation, we must prove through our actions that the Communist Party of China is dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly, willing to endure hardships, and make sacrifices for the people's interests. This is the fundamental reason why our cause wins the hearts of the people and achieves victory.

Liu Wenbiao is a judge. His work involves the dignity of the law and the honor and disgrace of people. In our country, there has always been the saying that "emotion is greater than law." In history, the few "upright judges" are still praised by people today. This shows that for a judge to be impartial and upright, it is very difficult. Comrade Liu Wenbiao's integrity and dedication, even to the point of not being lax about small matters like a few oranges, show that he has a precious sense of self-awareness, truly making the Party's purpose his life's guide. This is the fundamental reason why he has become a judge praised by the masses.

We advocate learning from Liu Wenbiao, hoping that everyone will learn from his serious and responsible attitude towards work and his integrity and dedication. We are not saying that one should not seek medical treatment when ill. For those like Liu Wenbiao who work selflessly, we should remind them to adopt a more practical and scientific attitude towards their own health. For some comrades, we should remind them not to forget their responsibilities as Communist Party members and not to engage in behavior that would disgrace this honorable title. We believe that with the development of the anti-corruption struggle and the construction of a clean government, more model figures like Liu Wenbiao will emerge, adding luster to our great Party.

### 值得学习的高尚品格

　　值得学习的高尚品格
    前几天，我们曾向读者推荐关于革命老前辈曾志同志简朴生活的通讯《共产党人的本色》（见9月9日本报一版），现在，我们再向大家推荐《清正法官》一文。这篇文章介绍了在法官岗位上甘守清贫、默默奉献的中年共产党员刘文彪同志的事迹。刘文彪同志“心中装满了党和人民的利益，却没有自己一席之地”的高尚情操感人至深，反映了新时期共产党员的精神风貌，值得我们学习。
    曾志同志的高尚品格，刘文彪同志的奉献精神，生动地说明，抵制和反对腐败是中国共产党人的本色和优良传统。这一点，在革命战争年代比较容易做到。在夺取全国政权之后，我们党的地位改变了，更需要每个共产党员继承和发扬艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公的优良传统，为民表率，带领广大群众去完成各项艰巨的任务。不论老一代共产党员还是新一代共产党员，都要用自己的实践证明：中国共产党是全心全意为人民服务的，为了人民的利益甘愿吃苦，甘愿做出自我牺牲。这正是我们的事业赢得人心、取得胜利的根本。
    刘文彪是个执法之“官”。他的工作涉及法律的尊严，牵涉人们的荣辱。我国自古以来有情大于法之说，历史上寥寥几个“清官”，至今还为人们传颂。这说明一个法官要想做到公正无私、刚直不阿，十分不易。刘文彪同志两袖清风，努力奉献，就连有的人看来是几个桔子这样的小事也一点不马虎，正说明他有一种可贵的自觉性，真正把党的宗旨化作自己的人生指南。这是他之所以能够成为群众称赞的好法官的根本原因。
    我们提倡学习刘文彪，是希望大家学习他对工作认真负责的精神和廉洁奉公的品质，并不是说有了病可以不去看，对那些像刘文彪一样忘我工作的同志，应该提醒他们对待自己的身体要多一点实事求是的科学态度；而对有些同志则应该提醒他们不要忘了作为共产党人的职责，不要做出有辱这个光荣称号的行为。我们相信，随着反腐败斗争和廉政建设的开展，将会有更多的刘文彪式的模范人物涌现出来，为我们伟大的党增添光彩。
