Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Henan Province's road transportation industry has made significant progress. We have established a preliminary road network centered around the provincial capital Zhengzhou, with national and provincial highways as the backbone, and branches connecting to them. By the end of 1988, Henan Province had 40,622 kilometers of roads in operation, ranking 9th nationwide, with 24.3 kilometers of roads per 100 square kilometers, ranking 11th nationwide. The province has 249,000 civilian vehicles and 130,000 tractors for transportation. The development of transportation has played a positive role in national economic construction, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and the convenience of people's material and cultural lives.

However, compared to the needs of national economic development, Henan Province's road transportation is still in a backward state and remains a significant factor constraining economic development.

Most of the roads in our province were developed in the late 1960s based on the original large vehicle roads, with low standards and poor disaster resistance. Fourth-class and below roads account for 67.5% of the total mileage, and second-class roads only have 2,266 kilometers. Due to the low standards and poor quality of the roads, mixed traffic, and flaws in the current traffic management system, the average speed of cars is only 30 kilometers per hour, which is only half of the economic speed of cars. This alone results in enormous economic losses.

Currently, the main source of funds for road construction in our province is the road maintenance fee. According to national regulations and our province's actual situation, 80% of the road maintenance fee is used for the maintenance and improvement of existing roads, and 20% is used for new road construction projects. Even this amount of road maintenance fee has to be remitted 15% for the energy and transportation construction fund and 10% for the budget adjustment fund, and it has to bear a traffic management subsidy of 10 million yuan. It does not include the road construction land occupation tax and the various miscellaneous expenses and allocations in road construction and maintenance. Nearly 27% of the road maintenance fee has been taken away. The price of road construction materials has risen faster than the growth rate of the road maintenance fee. In recent years, although our province has taken measures such as issuing road construction bonds, borrowing money to build roads and bridges, and implementing road construction and maintenance contracts, the bonds and loans issued still need to be repaid with principal and interest using the road maintenance fee. The collection of land occupation tax for road construction and the collection of energy and transportation construction fund and budget adjustment fund undoubtedly drains the already tight road construction funds. This has led to the road construction and maintenance contracts, which were once ahead of the national transportation system, falling into a dilemma. This not only makes it impossible to achieve the goal of transportation first, but may also further exacerbate the situation of transportation lagging behind, seriously affecting national economic and social development.

Roads are basic infrastructure serving the entire society. Although they do not directly generate benefits, the social benefits they produce are enormous. Taking the Zhengzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge as an example, the investment in building the bridge was 1.8 billion yuan, but after the bridge was completed, in addition to political, military, social, economic, and cultural benefits, the annual social transportation benefits alone amount to approximately 60 million yuan, and this is achieved as pure profit in various industries and departments of society. To alleviate the tense situation of transportation and solve the problem of transportation's leading role in national economic development, road transportation must have a certain amount of advance development. Fundamentally, investment in road transportation development must be increased. To this end, the following suggestions are proposed:

First, we must break free from traditional concepts and old thinking constraints. For a long time, we have not placed transportation in the leading position of economic development, but have been confined to the thinking of "non-production sector" and "road maintenance," placing transportation in a "subject" and "auxiliary" position. Therefore, in actual work, the tendency of "only industry, no transportation" and "heavy industry, light transportation" has emerged, and the state has invested very little in road transportation. Practice has shown that to open up to the outside world and activate the domestic economy, to develop a commodity economy, without a developed transportation system, we cannot open up or activate it. We must place transportation in the leading position of economic development, truly implement a tilt in ideology, policy, and investment, rely on the construction of a developed transportation system, and provide a good investment environment.

Second, solving the problem of transportation investment can be considered from two aspects. One is to include transportation in the investment budget of various levels of finance, determine the proportion of investment in transportation, and implement a tilt as far as possible under the conditions. The other is that under the reality of national financial difficulties, it is not possible to invest a large amount of money in transportation construction. First, solve the problem of "one tax and two funds," that is, exempt from paying the road construction land occupation tax, exempt from paying the road maintenance fee, energy and transportation construction fund, and budget adjustment fund, and ensure that the road maintenance fee is used for its intended purpose. This is a feasible measure to implement the policy of tilting towards transportation.

Third, the current road passenger and freight transportation has the prices of the 1960s and the consumption of the 1980s. Only the price of oil has risen to nearly 2,000 yuan per ton, and the prices of various parts have also risen again and again. Enterprises work hard for a year, but the benefits are minimal. Taking our province as an example, in 1988, the per capita profit retention of road transportation enterprises in the province was only 60 yuan, and 81% of the bus stations in the province were built in the 1950s, most of which have become dangerous buildings. Some counties still do not have bus station buildings, and passengers can only wait for the bus in the wind and rain. To solve the contradiction between the low income and high expenditure of road transportation enterprises and enhance the enterprises' ability to develop and transform themselves, it is necessary to ensure the planned oil quota for road transportation enterprises and adjust the road transportation prices reasonably as soon as possible.

    冲破传统观念和旧思维束缚
    克服“重工轻交”  落实“倾斜”政策
    河南省副省长　刘源
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我省公路交通事业有了很大发展，已经建成了初具规模的、以省会郑州为中心，以国道、省道为骨架、干支相连的公路辐射网。1988年底，我省公路通车里程达40622公里，居全国第9位，每百平方公里拥有24.3公里公路，居全国第11位，全省民用汽车24.9万辆，运输用拖拉机13万台。交通运输的发展，对国民经济建设、城乡物资交流、方便人民群众物质文化生活起到了积极作用。
    但是，同国民经济发展的需要相比，我省公路交通仍处于落后的地位，仍然是制约经济发展的重要因素。
    我省现有公路绝大部分是60年代末，在原有大车道的基础上发展起来的，标准低、抗灾能力差的问题十分严重。四级以下公路就占总里程的67.5％，二级公路仅有2266公里。由于公路标准低，质量差，混合交通以及现行交通管理体制上的弊端，汽车平均时速只有30公里，仅为汽车经济速度的1／2，仅此一项就造成惊人的经济损失。
    目前我省公路建设的资金来源主要依靠养路费。根据国家规定和我省实际，养路费的80％用于现有公路养护、改善，20％用于公路新建项目。就这一点养路费，还要上缴15％的能源交通建设基金和10％的预算调节基金，还要负担交通管理补助费1000万元，还不包括公路建设耕地占用税和公路建设养护中名目繁多的杂支摊派，养路费就被拿走了近27％。公路建材价格上涨超过了养路费增长幅度。近几年，虽然我省先后采取了发行公路建设债券、贷款修路架桥和实行公路建设、养护大包干等项措施，但是发行的债券和贷款，还得用养路费偿还本息。对公路建设征收耕地占用税和征收能源交通建设基金、预算调节基金，无疑是在公路建设资金已经十分紧张的情况下釜底抽薪，使我省曾在全国交通系统先走一步的公路建设、养护大包干，陷入进退维谷的境地。这不仅使交通先行实现不了，还可能进一步加剧交通滞后的状况，严重影响国民经济和社会发展。
    公路是为全社会服务的基础设施，它虽然本身不直接产生效益，但它所产生的社会效益是巨大的。以郑州黄河公路大桥为例，建桥投资1.8亿元，而大桥建成以后，除了政治、军事、社会经济及文化的效益以外，仅每年产生的社会运输效益约达6000万元，而且是以纯利收入实现在社会各个行业、部门。要缓解交通运输的紧张状况，解决好交通运输在国民经济发展中的先行地位问题；公路交通必须有一定提前量的发展。从根本上讲，要对公路交通发展增加投入。为此提出如下建议：
    一、首先要冲破传统观念和旧思维的束缚。长期以来，我们没有把交通运输放在发展经济的主导地位，而囿于“非生产部门”和“以路养路”的思维，把交通运输摆在“客体”、“附庸”的位置，因此，在实际工作中产生了“只工不交”和“重工轻交”的倾向，国家对公路交通极少给予投资。实践表明，我们要对外开放，对内搞活，要发展商品经济，没有发达的交通运输就放不开，也搞不活。必须把交通运输作为发展经济的主导，真正从思想观念上、政策上、投资上实行正倾斜，依靠建设发达的交通运输条件，提供良好的投资环境。
    二、解决交通运输投资主要可以从两个方面去考虑。一是把交通运输列入各级财政投资预算，确定用于交通运输的投资比例，在条件允许的情况下，尽可能实行倾斜。二是在国家财政困难的现实情况下，不可能大量投资用于交通建设。首先解决好“一税两基金”问题，即免交公路建设耕地占用税，免交养路费、能源交通建设基金和预算调节基金，确保养路费专款专用，是落实对交通运输实行倾斜政策的可行措施。
    三、公路客货运输目前是60年代的运价、80年代的消费。仅油料价格上涨到每吨近2000元，各种机配件价格也一涨再涨，企业辛苦一年，收益甚微。以我省为例，1988年全省公路运输企业人均留利仅60元，全省还有81％汽车站是50年代建设的，大部分已成危房，还有一些县至今没有汽车站房，旅客只能顶风冒雨候车。为了解决公路运输企业低收入对高支出的矛盾，增强企业自我发展与改造的能力，应确保公路运输企业计划内用油指标，尽快合理调整公路运价。
