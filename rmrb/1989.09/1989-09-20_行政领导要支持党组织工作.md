Title: Administrative Leaders Must Support Party Organization Work

Recently, I visited six grassroots units under a certain enterprise to understand the situation of party organization building. I found that the number of people writing applications to join the party has been decreasing year by year. In these six grassroots units, 21 people wrote applications to join the party in 1984, but this number dropped to 3 in 1988. Workers who have written applications to join the party are unwilling to attend meetings to study basic party knowledge. The status of the party organization in the minds of the masses is not as high as it used to be. An old party member sighed, "In the past, non-party members were very willing to talk to me and were willing to listen to the opinions of the party organization and party members about themselves, either directly or indirectly. Since 1988, many non-party members no longer greet me voluntarily."

The main reason for the above problems is that the party organization itself is not playing a sufficient role. Currently, most of the leaders of grassroots party organizations in enterprises hold administrative positions and devote most of their energy to administrative work. Full-time party workers, on the one hand, feel that they have no real power and find it difficult to solve problems. On the other hand, they feel that some work is inconvenient to do, fearing that they might "overstep their authority" and affect the unity of the leadership team.

In practice, if the main administrative leaders do not care about and support the work of the party organization, the role of the party organization will be difficult to play.

　　行政领导要支持党组织工作
    最近，我到一个企业下属的6个基层单位了解党组织建设的情况，发现写入党申请书的人数逐年减少。这6个基层单位1984年填写入党申请书的有21人，1988年下降到3人。填写了入党申请书的职工，不愿意参加学习党的基本知识等会议。党组织在群众心目中的地位不如过去。有位老党员深有感触地说“原来非党同志很愿意同我谈心，直接或间接地愿意听取党组织、党员对自己的意见。1988年以来，不少非党同志不再主动跟我打招呼了。”
    造成以上问题的主要原因。是党组织本身发挥作用不够。目前，企业基层党组织负责人大多数兼行政职务，他们把主要精力用于行政工作，而专职的党务工作者一是感到手中没有实权，难以解决问题。二是感到有些工作不便做，怕“越权”，影响领导班子的团结。
    从实践看，如果主要行政领导同志对党组织的工作不关心、不支持，党组织的作用便难以发挥。
