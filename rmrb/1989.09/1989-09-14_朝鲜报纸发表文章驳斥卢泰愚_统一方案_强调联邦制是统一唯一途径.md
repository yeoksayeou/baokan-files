North Korean newspaper refutes Roh Tae-woo's "unification plan"
Stresses federal system is the only path to unification

Our reporter Xu Baokang reports from Pyongyang on September 14th: The North Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* today published a lengthy commentary criticizing South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's "national community unification plan" proposed on September 11th, labeling it a scheme to create "two Koreas" and reaffirming that a federal system is the only path to Korean unification.

According to reports, Roh Tae-woo proposed a so-called "national community unification plan" in the South Korean National Assembly on September 11th. The basic content of this plan is to establish a "transitional intermediate stage" before South-North unification, during which a "South-North Cabinet Conference" and "South-North High-Level Conference" would be set up. Through "exchange" and "cooperation," the foundation for unification would be sought, followed by a "unification charter," a "general election," and finally the establishment of a "unified state" with a "single system" and a "democratic republic."

The *Rodong Sinmun* commentary pointed out that Roh Tae-woo's proposal of an "intermediate stage" is essentially an attempt to formally transform South-North relations into "state" relations, thereby legalizing "two Koreas."

The article states that the fundamental issue of building trust between the North and the South is not "exchange" and "cooperation" between the two, but rather the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the cessation of U.S. interference and aggression.

The article reaffirms that the issue of Korean unification is not about one side absorbing the other, nor is it about merging two systems into one. Rather, it is about a single nation achieving unity. Under these conditions, aside from acknowledging the existing two systems and achieving unification through a federal system, there is no other path.

The article points out that Roh Tae-woo's attempt to achieve "system unification" and his use of "human rights," "freedom," and "openness" to attack the North indicates that South Korea still harbors illusions of "victory over communism" and seeks to indefinitely delay the resolution of the Korean unification issue.

The article believes that Roh Tae-woo's plan is another serious betrayal of the Korean people.

### 朝鲜报纸发表文章驳斥卢泰愚“统一方案”　强调联邦制是统一唯一途径

　　朝鲜报纸发表文章驳斥卢泰愚“统一方案”
　　强调联邦制是统一唯一途径
    本报平壤9月14日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表长篇评论文章，严厉批驳南朝鲜总统卢泰愚11日提出的“民族共同体统一方案”，是制造“两个朝鲜”的分裂方案，并再次重申，联邦制是实现朝鲜统一的唯一途径。
    据报道，卢泰愚11日在南朝鲜国会上抛出了一个所谓“民族共同体统一方案”。这一方案的基本内容是，在南北实现统一之前，首先设立一个“过渡性的中间阶段”，在这一阶段，设立“南北阁僚会议”和“南北高级会议”，并通过“交流”和“合作”，谋求统一“基础”，然后通过“统一宪章”，实行“总选举”，最后建立一个“制度统一”的“单一国家”“民主共和国”。
    《劳动新闻》评论文章指出，卢泰愚提出“中间阶段”的实质是，企图把南北关系正式转为“国家”关系，从而使“两个朝鲜”合法化。
    文章指出，北南之间谋求信赖的根本问题，不是南北之间的“交流”和“合作”，而是美国从南朝鲜撤军和停止对南朝鲜的干涉和侵略。
    文章重申，朝鲜统一问题，不是一方吃掉另一方，也不是把两种制度合二为一，而是一个民族实现联合的问题。在这种条件下，北南除承认现存的两种制度，以联邦制实现统一之外，没有任何其它道路。
    文章指出，卢泰愚妄图以“制度统一”，并以“人权”、“自由”、“开放”攻击北方，说明南朝鲜至今仍对“胜共统一”抱有幻想，并企图无限期地延长对朝鲜统一问题的解决。
    文章认为，卢泰愚的方案，是对朝鲜民族的又一次严重背叛行为。
