The waters of the Zhujiang River remain gentle and long, the pines of the Wuling Mountains remain tall and noble; the banana trees are lush, the southern winds are moist, and the south is the pride of the motherland. Reform, reform, reform... the drumbeats of the times urge the south to run swiftly; open up, open up, open up... the winds from all over the world surge into the embrace of the south. In ten years, the scaffolding has grown tall, and the south has become even more charming and beautiful; in ten years, the mountains and rivers have turned green again, and the south's youth is everlasting. Sunshine, seawater, white clouds, electronics, sugar, golden rice, in the land of the Republic, the south is forever the pride of the motherland.

　　南方
　　李钟声珠江水依然温柔绵长，五岭松依然挺拔崇高；芭蕉肥，南风润，南方是祖国的骄傲。改革，改革，改革……时代的鼓点催南方迅跑；开放，开放，开放……四海的风涌进南方的怀抱。十年脚手架拔节，南方变得更妩媚美好；十年江山重绿，南方的青春不老。阳光、海水、白云，电子、砂糖、金稻，在共和国的土地上，南方永远是祖国的骄傲。
