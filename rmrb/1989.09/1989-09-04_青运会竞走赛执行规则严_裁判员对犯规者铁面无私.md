The organizing committee of the second National Youth Games race walking competition strictly adhered to the competition rules. In yesterday's competition, most of the participating athletes strictly followed the rules and exerted their technical abilities to the fullest. However, a few athletes either lacked sportsmanship and engaged in deception, or had insufficient skills and were overly eager to win, intentionally or unintentionally violating the rules.

In the men's A group 10,000-meter race, an athlete from Liaoning intentionally lagged behind for two laps to conserve energy and assist a teammate, ignoring warnings and was promptly disqualified. In the men's B group 5,000-meter final, as the race neared the finish line, five athletes exhibited clear violations of the rules, such as "running" and bending their legs. One hour after the race ended, it was announced that their results were nullified. This included the top three finishers. In the women's B group 3,000-meter final, one female athlete, due to weak fundamentals, was disqualified for having both feet off the ground.

The organizing committee combined punishment with education, sending representatives to talk with the disqualified athletes, encouraging them to reflect on their experiences and lessons, and to strive for good results under the principle of fair competition. That evening, judges and coaches held a discussion until late into the night, analyzing the causes of unfair practices and rule violations, and studying preventive measures to ensure good competition results in future events.

    青运会竞走赛执行规则严
    裁判员对犯规者铁面无私
    据新华社鞍山九月三日电　（记者陈光明、通讯员王忠奇）第二届全国青运会竞走竞委会严格遵守竞赛规则。在昨天的比赛中，参赛大多数运动员严守赛规，尽力发挥自己的技术水平，但也有少数运动员或不讲道德、弄虚作假，或技不过关、求胜心切，有意无意地违犯了规则。　　在男子甲组万米比赛中，辽宁一运动员故意拉下两圈保存体力带本队一名运动员竞走，且不顾警告，被果断罚出场。男子乙组五千米决赛临近终点时，有五名运动员在冲刺中出现了明显违反规则的“跑”和曲腿现象，比赛结束一小时后宣布被取消成绩。其中包括到达终点的前三名选手。一女运动员在女子乙组三千米决赛中因基本功不扎实，有两腿腾空现象也被罚下场。
    竞委会还把处罚和教育紧密结合，派人与被罚运动员谈心，鼓励他们认真总结经验教训，在公平竞赛的原则下争创好成绩。当晚，裁判员、教练员还座谈讨论到深夜，分析不正之风、违反赛规的原因，研究防止办法，争取在以后的竞赛中以优良赛风比出好成绩。
