How can agriculture break through its current stagnation and further improve economic benefits? Our experience in Langfang City has shown that implementing regionalized agricultural management is an effective approach.

In 1986, we proposed the implementation of large-scale land management based on the actual situation where township enterprises were relatively developed. In areas with suitable conditions, we promoted the concentration of land towards skilled farmers. This approach yielded good results in some villages. However, 85% of the villages in the city did not have such conditions. How to improve the economic benefits of agricultural management in these villages became the key to advancing agriculture in the entire city. The experience of developing regionalized agriculture in some places inspired us. Since 1982, Ba County's Nanmeng Town began large-scale cultivation of watermelons, gradually forming a watermelon cultivation area covering 30 villages and 2350 mu. The yield and output value per mu of watermelons were 20% and 35% higher than in neighboring villages, respectively. Similar agricultural and animal husbandry (including supporting processing industries) small areas that developed well include Xianghe County's Zhouzhuang for poultry farming, Gu'an County's Pengcun Township for radish cultivation, and Yongqing County's Yongding River old riverbed area for cattle and sheep farming. Their economic benefits were generally 30% higher than the average. This shows that economies of scale can be achieved through the relative concentration of land, and similarly, through the relative concentration of products. Moreover, it is easier for most farmers to accept and implement. Especially, regionalized agriculture is suitable for both villages with developed and underdeveloped non-agricultural industries, and the benefits are particularly evident in areas where agriculture is the mainstay and land is scarce.

After a period of effort, the entire city has initially formed: 292 wheat and corn areas with a regional area of more than 1000 mu and four unified services (planning, variety, service, field management), with a yield of more than 500 kg per mu last year, exceeding the city's average yield by more than 100 kg; 89 vegetable areas with a regional area of more than 500 mu, with an average yield of 3750 kg per mu, exceeding the city's average level by more than 600 kg; 152 concentrated melon (fruit melon) areas, accounting for half of the city's area, with production accounting for nearly two-thirds of the city's total output; 19 fruit areas with a regional area of more than 5000 mu and 6 fruit areas with more than 10,000 mu, accounting for 40% of the city's area and 60% of the production; 12 aquaculture areas with more than 500 mu of contiguous blocks; 225 concentrated poultry (egg) farming areas; and 413 other livestock farming areas of various scales. In some places, there are also specialized agricultural product processing areas that match farming and animal husbandry.

To promote regionalized development, we have put a lot of thought into strengthening and improving services, and explored some successful practices.

Managing agriculture like industry, focusing on projects to provide services. Based on scientific planning and repeated demonstrations, we determined several concentrated production areas for different products. Then, we broke down the various service tasks for each product area into several mandatory indicators and implemented them layer by layer through contract signing. At the same time, each region, based on actual conditions, strengthened the construction of basic facilities to meet the needs of increased quantities of goods for processing, transportation, and storage.

Transforming the functions of government departments, focusing on coordination and intermediary service organizations. Langfang mainly focused on two types: First, government economic and technical departments and supply and marketing cooperatives directly established various companies, farms, processing plants, and service centers, implementing enterprise management and separating government from enterprise, acting as the "leading" force for regionalized production. For example, Sanhe County, to develop "three crops (cotton, vegetables, fruits) and five livestock (pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, fish)," established eight major specialized companies in the county agricultural commission, commerce bureau, foreign trade bureau, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments. Each company is responsible for solving the supply, production technology, and other aspects of the difficulties in the specialized product areas, implementing a series of paid services. Second, helping farmers establish self-service organizations, including various associations, research societies, cooperatives, and companies. Currently, there are 1877 such organizations that have played a significant role in the development of regionalized agriculture in the city. After the emergence of numerous service organizations, coordination work has become significantly heavier. We timely proposed the guiding ideology of: "Township level manages blocks, departments manage funds, self-service organizations manage improvement, county level manages coordination." Some counties have established some authoritative coordination organizations accordingly, forming a "grand chorus" of commodity production around regionalized management.

More significantly, the formation and development of regionalization have provided experience for solving some difficult problems in the transition of traditional agriculture to commercialization and modernization:

Promoting the formation of a mechanism for self-accumulation and self-development in agriculture. In the process of implementing agricultural regionalization, most places have implemented a land lease system characterized by "double-field system," that is, each household retains a certain amount of food land, and the rest of the land is leased according to a unified plan for regional planting. The land within the leased area requires a certain lease fee to be paid in advance, which is uniformly managed by the village and township, taking from the farmers and using it for the land.

Further consolidating and improving the operating system based on household contracting. Regionalized management is a large-scale management with diversified production subjects. It retains the advantages of household management while strengthening the secondary management. The organization of regionalized production services can be village-run, township-run, or county-run; it can be government-run or privately-run. At the same time, it strongly promoted the transformation of government economic and technical departments' functions. They can use a certain product's concentrated production area as a support to showcase their talents.

    实行区域化经营  提高经济效益
    赵惠臣
    农业怎样才能突破徘徊，进一步提高经济效益？我们廊坊市的实践证明，实行农业区域化经营不失为一条有效途径。
    一1986年，我们就根据当地乡镇企业比较发达的实际情况，及时提出实行土地规模经营，在有条件的地方，促进土地向种田能手相对集中。这一做法在一些村收到了良好效果。然而，全市85％的村并不具备这样的条件。如何把这些村的农业经营效益搞上去，就成了全市农业再上新台阶的重点。一些地方发展区域化农业的经验使我们受到启发。霸县南孟镇从1982年起，开始大面积种植西瓜，逐步形成了涉及30个村，面积2350亩的西瓜种植区，西瓜亩产和亩产值分别比相邻村高20％和35％，类似的种养业（包括与之配套的加工业）小区发展比较好的还有香河县周庄的养鸡、固安县彭村乡的种萝卜、永清县永定河故道区的养牛羊等等。他们的经济效益普遍比一般的高30％以上。这说明，规模效益通过土地相对集中可以获得，通过产品相对集中同样也可以获得。而且更容易为大多数农民所接受，实行起来比较容易。尤其是，区域化农业在非农产业发达和不发达的乡村都比较适用，在以农为主和人多地少的地方，好处尤为明显。
    经过一段时期的努力，全市已初步形成：区域面积1000亩以上、服务项目达到四统一（规划、品种、服务、田间管理）的小麦玉米区292个，去年亩产达500公斤以上，超过全市平均单产100多公斤；区域面积500亩以上的蔬菜区89个，平均亩产3750公斤，超过全市平均水平600多公斤；集中产瓜（果用瓜）区152个，面积占全市的一半，产量几乎占全市总产量的2／3；区域面积5000亩以上果品区19个，万亩以上果品区6个，面积占全市的40％，产量占60％；500亩以上成方连片的水产品区12个；肉（蛋）鸡集中饲养区225个；其他各种规模不等的养殖业集中区413个。在一些地方，也出现了与种养业相配套的农产品专业加工区。
    二为了促进区域化发展，我们围绕强化服务、改善服务动了不少脑筋，探索了一些成功的做法。
    像搞工业那样搞农业，围绕项目搞服务。在科学规划、反复论证的基础上，确定了若干不同产品的集中产区。然后把每个产品区的各项服务任务分解成若干硬性指标，并通过签订承包合同，层层落实到部门和人。同时，各区域从实际出发，加强基础设施建设。以满足商品量增加后的加、运、贮等需要。
    转变政府部门职能，重点抓好协调和中间服务组织。廊坊主要抓了两类：一是，由政府经济技术部门和供销社直接出面，组建各种公司、农（牧）场、加工厂和服务中心，实行企业化经营和政企分开，充当区域化生产的“龙头”。如三河县为发展“三种（棉、菜、果）五养（猪、牛、羊、鸡、鱼）”分别在县农委、商业局、外贸局、供销社等部门成立了果品、蔬菜、畜禽等八大专业公司，每个公司具体负责解决本专业产品区的供销、生产技术等方面的难题，实行系列化有偿服务。二是，帮助农民建立自我服务组织，包括各种协会、研究会、合作社、公司等。目前，在全市发展区域化农业过程中起到明显作用的这类组织已有1877个。众多的服务组织出现后，协调工作明显加重。我们及时提出了：“乡级抓块，部门抓钱，自我服务抓提高，县级抓协调”的指导思想。一些县相应成立了一些有权威的协调组织，围绕区域化经营形成了商品生产“大合唱”的局面。
    三更为有意义的是，区域化的形成和发展，为解决传统农业向商品化现代化转变中一些难以解决的问题，提供了经验：
    促进了农业自我积累、自我发展机制的形成。在实行农业区域化的过程中，大多数地方都搞了以“双田制”为特征的土地有偿承包，即每个农户留一定数量的口粮田，其余土地按照统一规划实行区域种植，承包区域内土地，要事先交一定的承包费，由村、乡统一掌握，取之于农，用之于土。
    进一步巩固和完善了以家庭承包为基础的经营体制。区域化经营是一种生产主体多元化的规模经营，它既保留了家庭经营的优势，又强化二层经营。区域化生产服务的组织可以是村办的，也可以是乡办的，还可以是县办的；可以是“官”办的，也可以是民办的。同时还有力地推动了政府经济技术部门的职能转变。他们可以以某种产品的集中产区为依托，施展自己的才能。
