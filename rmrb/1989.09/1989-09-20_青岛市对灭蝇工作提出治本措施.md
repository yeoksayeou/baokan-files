Your newspaper published a letter and photograph on August 1, 2019, on page six, titled "Children's Reflections on Mosquito and Fly Control," which criticized the situation where some primary school students in our city were seen swarming around garbage bins to catch flies. The situation described is basically accurate.

Since June this year, the density of mosquitoes and flies in our city has been on the rise. The municipal government has directed the mobilization of the masses to collectively reduce the density of mosquitoes and flies. During the organization of these activities, it was found that a few schools, in order to complete the mosquito and fly control tasks, had assigned quotas to primary school students, leading to the phenomenon of children swarming around garbage bins to catch flies. This approach is inappropriate and should be improved in the future. The focus should be on educating young children to develop good hygiene habits.

The Municipal Health and Hygiene Committee and other relevant departments, in response to the existing problems, have proposed fundamental measures for mosquito and fly control:

1. Organize the professional pest control teams of each district and street office to spray chemicals and clean up mosquito and fly breeding grounds in garbage bins, public toilets, sewers, hygiene boxes, markets, and garbage collection points every day.
2. Ensure timely garbage collection and disposal, achieving daily production and daily clearance, and have the Environmental Sanitation Bureau disinfect the garbage disposal sites.
3. Conduct regular inspections and supervision.

### 青岛市对灭蝇工作提出治本措施

专栏：批评以后

　　青岛市对灭蝇工作提出治本措施
    你报8月1日第六版刊登了《儿童灭蝇的联想》的读者来信和照片，对我市部分小学生围绕垃圾箱捕打苍蝇一事提出了批评，情况基本属实。
    今年进入6月份以后，我市蚊蝇密度开始上升。市政府指示发动群众一齐动手，把蚊蝇密度降下来，在组织活动中，确有少数学校为完成灭蝇任务向小学生下达过灭蝇指标，出现了一些小学生围着垃圾箱打苍蝇的现象。这种做法不妥，今后应注意改进，把着重点放在教育少年儿童养成良好卫生习惯上。
    市爱卫会等有关部门针对存在的问题，对灭蝇工作提出了治本措施：一是组织各区、街道办事处的消杀专业队伍，对全市垃圾箱、公共厕所、污水沟、卫生箱、市场和垃圾点每天坚持喷洒药物，清除和控制蚊蝇孳生场所；二是及时清运垃圾，做到日产日清，由环卫局对销纳垃圾场进行消毒；三是定期进行督促检查。
