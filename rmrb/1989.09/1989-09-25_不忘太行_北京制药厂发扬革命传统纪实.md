During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the 3,680 employees of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory did not have a single person participate in the looting, arson, and rioting, nor did anyone go on strike or stop production. In mid-May, when the streets were at their most chaotic, many employees walked to work and continued production. On the early morning of June 4, when soldiers from a certain unit of the martial law troops were dispersed and besieged, the couple Dian Shaoching and Yang Jie, who proudly called themselves "Beijing Pharmaceutical People," risked their lives to rescue the soldier Guo Yongquan, who had been beaten unconscious by the rioters. After Guo Yongquan recovered, Dian Shaoching and Yang Jie escorted him back to his unit. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, many soldiers were injured by rioters. The "Beijing Pharmaceutical People" worked overtime to produce a large batch of medicines for the troops.

The certain unit of the martial law troops was born in the Taihang Mountains in 1939 at the same time as "Beijing Pharmaceutical." On August 1, during the 50th anniversary celebration of "Beijing Pharmaceutical," an officer from this unit who attended the celebration said: "'Beijing Pharmaceutical People' have completely inherited the Taihang tradition!"

In 1939, the Pharmaceutical Department of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the Pharmaceutical Factory of the 129th Division's Medical Department merged to form "Lihua Pharmaceutical Factory." In those turbulent times, the factory workers, with an iron pot and a stone mortar, traveled through the Taihang Mountains on horseback, producing various medicines and sending them to the front lines, saving our national elites.

In 1949, Lihua Pharmaceutical Factory moved to the capital and was renamed Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory. On the first day of entering the capital, the then factory leaders proposed at a meeting: The environment has changed, the factory name has changed, and the management system has changed. However, the Taihang tradition of "firmly following the Communist Party to build a new socialist China" created by countless people with their blood and lives cannot change! When the current factory director, Qiao Junfeng, took office in 1984, he said: I believe most in people. People influenced by the Taihang tradition can be invincible and create limitless value. At the factory-wide employee representative meeting, Qiao Junfeng proposed to concretize the Taihang tradition into four aspects: the national spirit of fearlessness, the spirit of striving for excellence, the spirit of hard work and dedication, and the spirit of saving lives and helping the injured. From 1986 to 1987, Qiao Junfeng organized multiple groups of people to traverse the Taihang Mountains, trace their roots, and receive education.

Visitors to the Taihang Mountains came to the site of the former Lihua Pharmaceutical Factory and learned that the "Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory," which is now a national second-class enterprise, was once just five cave dwellings, and they were all moved to tears. They also visited more than 40 "old Taihang" veterans, reviewed a large amount of historical materials, and compiled a 100,000-word factory history, distributing a copy to each employee. "Beijing Pharmaceutical" also produced the video "The Glory of Taihang," established a factory history exhibition hall. Whenever new employees enter the factory, the first thing they do is to give them a factory history lesson, visit the factory history exhibition hall, and watch the video. Whenever there is a gathering, all employees must sing the factory song: "The majestic Taihang, shining with glory..." In 1988, "Beijing Pharmaceutical" was rated as a national outstanding enterprise in ideological and political work.

Loving the Communist Party is the essence of the Taihang tradition. This tradition is now being manifested in the new generation of "Beijing Pharmaceutical People." During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, many employees did not believe or spread rumors. One worker said: "The Party's voice is the most reliable!" Deputy Chief Engineer Qiu Qing'an is a returned overseas Chinese. After entering the factory in 1970, he has been quietly responsible for product selection, topic determination, and information intelligence. His father left a considerable inheritance abroad, which needed him, the sole heir, to go and inherit. He said: For decades, the Communist Party has shed blood and sacrificed for the liberation of the entire nation, creating a new socialist China. As a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, how can I, at the time of the country's need for talent, run abroad to build a comfortable nest? I should inherit the Taihang tradition, take root in the motherland, and dedicate myself to "Beijing Pharmaceutical." To develop new products, he traveled to 29 provinces and cities to gather information, read a large amount of foreign literature, but never once went sightseeing. Together with other comrades, he selected and determined 103 topics in 1987 alone, reported 46 new products, approved 31 for production, and achieved a production value of 10.72 million yuan.

In the video "The Glory of Taihang," there is a scene: Day and night, the only donkey was worked to death, and everyone had to take turns pushing the mill. When hungry, they hugged the mill rod and ate cold steamed buns; when tired, they dozed off but did not stop their feet. Many comrades were overworked, their calf tendons were injured, and lifting their legs felt like being cut by a knife, but no one complained. They did not participate in the Long March, but pushing the mill and grinding, everyone walked more than 25,000 miles. Although there are modern facilities now, the workers still maintain the spirit of struggle. On June 5, the martial law troops urgently needed glucose injections, and the workers worked overtime to produce 20,000 bottles in one day.

In 1986, a production workshop in the factory was expanded and relocated, and the relocation alone cost 10 million yuan. The employees argued: "Every day we talk about dedication, can't we be a little more hardworking and save this 10 million yuan?" One worker patted the factory history book and said: "It's written here, during the Taihang days, our predecessors fought in all directions, all by hand and shoulder, today, we should do it ourselves!" The workers of the machine repair workshop, who usually only undertake medium-sized repair tasks, took the command. Without large-scale lifting equipment, they pulled and carried like the "Beijing Pharmaceutical People" of that time. In the end, during the project, the impeller of the flow meter was unexpectedly stuck. Immediately, part of the liquefied gas in the 50-ton vertical storage tank filled the site. The unpleasant smell made people cry. However, the workers did not retreat half a step, but calmly, united, and eliminated the fault, completing the task ahead of schedule and with quality. A worker from an external unit said: "'Beijing Pharmaceutical People' work day and night without taking any extra bonuses, truly amazing!" The "Beijing Pharmaceutical People" replied: "Our factory history has the radiant Taihang spirit."

    不忘太行
    ——北京制药厂发扬革命传统纪实

    一
    在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，北京制药厂的3680多名职工没有1人参加打砸抢烧，没有1人罢工停产。5月中旬街上最乱的时候，许多职工步行上班，坚持生产。6月4日凌晨，当戒严部队某部官兵被冲散受围攻时，骄傲地自称“北药”人的田少清、杨捷夫妇冒着生命危险，将被暴徒殴打昏死过去的战士郭永泉抢救出来。郭永泉伤愈后，田少清、杨捷夫妇又将其护送归队。在平息反革命暴乱中，部队许多官兵被暴徒打伤，“北药”人加班加点，为部队赶制了大批药品。
    戒严部队某部是1939年在太行山与“北药”同时诞生的。8月1日“北药”举行50周年厂庆时，到会祝贺的这支部队一位军官说：“‘北药’人完完整整地继承了太行传统！”
    二
    1939年，八路军总部卫生部制药所和129师卫生部制药厂合并，得名“利华药厂”。在那战火纷飞的年代，药厂职工怀着与敌人血战到底的无畏气慨，凭着一口铁锅和一具石臼，转战太行，在马背上制出各种药剂，源源不断地送往各个战场，救护了我们的民族精英。
    1949年，利华药厂迁入首都，更名北京制药厂。进入首都的第一天，当时的厂领导便在会上响亮地提出：环境变了，厂名变了，管理体制变了。但是，千百万人流血牺牲创造的“坚决跟着共产党，打出一个社会主义新中国”的太行传统不能变！现任厂长乔俊峰1984年上任时就说：我最相信的是人。受太行传统熏陶的人，是能够无坚不摧，创造无限价值的。在全厂职工代表大会上，乔俊峰提议将太行传统具体化为4个方面，即不畏强暴的民族精神，励精图治的拚搏精神，艰苦创业的奉献精神，救死扶伤的服务精神。1986年到1987年，乔俊峰先后组织多批人员跋涉太行，寻根溯源，接受教育。
    访问太行的人来到当年利华药厂的遗址，了解到今天跻身于国家二级企业的“北药”厂当年竟是5孔窑洞时，都感动得哭了。他们还访问了40多位“老太行”，查阅了大量的历史资料，编写了10万字的厂史，发给全厂职工人手一册。“北药”还拍摄了《太行的光辉》录相片，建立了厂史陈列室。凡有新职工进厂，第一件事便是给他们上厂史课，参观厂史陈列室和看录相片。凡有集会，全体职工必定要高唱厂歌：“巍巍太行，闪耀着光芒……”1988年，“北药”被评为全国思想政治工作优秀企业。
    三
    热爱共产党，是太行传统的精髓。这种传统，正在新一代“北药”人身上发挥作用。北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，许多职工不信谣传也不传谣。有位工人说：“党的声音最可靠！”副总工程师邱庆安是归国华侨。1970年进厂后，一直默默无闻地负责产品选题、定题和情报信息。他父亲在国外有一笔十分可观的遗产，需要他这位唯一的继承人前去继承。他说：几十年来，共产党为全民族的解放流血牺牲，才有了社会主义新中国。作为炎黄子孙，我怎么能在祖国的用人之秋跑到国外去建安乐窝呢？我应该继承的是太行传统，扎根祖国，献身“北药”。为了开发新产品，他到29个省、市捕捉信息，阅读了大量的外文资料，却从未游山玩水一次。他与其他同志一起，仅1987年就选题、定题103个，新产品上报46个，批回生产31个，获产值1072万元。

      《太行的光辉》录相片中，有这样一组镜头：日夜拉磨压碾，唯一的毛驴累死了，大家只好轮着推碾。饿了，抱着碾棍啃冷馒头；困了，打着盹儿脚不停。许多同志劳累过度，小腿韧带损伤，抬腿就觉刀割地疼，但没人有一句怨言。他们虽然没有一人参加长征，可是推磨压碾，每个人都不止走了二万五千里。如今虽说有了现代化设备，但是，工人们依然保持了拚搏劲头。6月5日，戒严部队急需葡萄糖注射液，工人们便加班加点，一天生产了2万瓶。
    1986年，厂里有个生产车间扩大、搬迁，单是搬迁费就得100万元。职工们吵嚷着：“成天讲奉献，难道我们不能再苦一点累一点，省下这100万吗？”有位工人拍着厂史书说：“这上面写着哩，在太行时，我们的老前辈南征北战，都是人拉肩扛，今天，我们也自己干！”平时只能承担中型维修任务的机修车间工人领命而去。没有大型吊装设备，他们像当年的“北药”人那样手拉肩扛。最后工程中，流量计的转子意外地被卡住了。顿时，50吨立升贮罐中的部分液化气充满现场。难闻的气味，使人涕泪俱下。然而，工人们没有一个后退半步，而是沉着冷静、齐心协力、排除故障，提前保质完成了任务。外单位一位工人说：“‘北药’人黑夜白天挺着干，一点额外奖金都不拿，真不简单！”“北药”人回答：“我们的厂史里面，有光芒四射的太行精神。”
