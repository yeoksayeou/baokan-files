From the first atomic bomb explosion to the successful development of the "Galaxy" billion-transistor computer, the knowledge workers of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense have a broad stage to showcase their talents. Here, the spirit of nurturing and utilizing talent has long been deeply ingrained.

The Party's cultivation and education, along with the practical experience and training in national defense scientific research, have fostered a cadre of national defense scientists and technicians with high political awareness and advanced scientific and technological skills. From the successful detonation of the first atomic bomb to the launch of communication satellites and the development of the "Galaxy" billion-transistor computer, all these achievements are the result of their hard work and wisdom. This cadre has made tremendous contributions to the modernization and development of China's national defense. Since 1985, the various units under the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense have won over 6,000 scientific and technological progress awards.

The Party organizations at various levels of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense have made respecting knowledge and talent an important part of their work. They have corrected the tendency to demand perfection and impose endless probation periods when considering intellectuals for Party membership, and have prioritized the recruitment of outstanding intellectuals into the Party while ensuring political quality. Currently, the proportion of Party members among national defense scientific and technical personnel is approximately 61.2%.

Since 1982, the Commission has conducted three inspections on the implementation of policies for intellectuals across the entire organization. In 1986, a special inspection was conducted on the cultivation, education, and utilization of young intellectuals, focusing on summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and establishing files for outstanding scientific and technical talents.

In 1988, the Commission awarded the "Dedication to National Defense Science and Technology" honor certificate and certificate to the broad masses of scientific and technical personnel who have long been engaged in the front lines of national defense scientific research and experimentation. It also commended units and individuals who have made significant contributions to national defense science and technology.

The Commission has fully utilized scientific and technical personnel, providing a stage for intellectuals to showcase their talents. A number of outstanding intellectuals have taken up leadership positions. Among the leadership teams at the division level and above in the Commission, 73.4% have a bachelor's degree or higher. The Commission has established a technical position responsibility system to ensure that scientific and technical personnel have positions, responsibilities, and authority. It has also placed young intellectuals on the front lines of scientific research and experimentation. Since the reform of professional titles, more than a hundred middle-aged and young scientific and technical personnel who have made significant contributions have been promoted to senior professional and technical positions. Various methods have been adopted to expand channels, strengthen technical training, accelerate knowledge updates, and improve the level of scientific research and experimentation.

Since 1979, more than 10,000 people have participated in various business training classes, and nearly 20,000 scientific and technical personnel have participated in on-the-job training.

The Commission has also actively engaged in international technical cooperation and exchanges, and through various channels, has introduced talents and intelligence. It has selected outstanding scientific and technical personnel to study and train abroad. Over 3,000 people have been organized to go abroad for technical exchanges and inspections; nearly 300 people have been sent to study abroad, with nearly 100 having returned after completing their studies. The majority have become academic and technical leaders, and many have taken up leadership positions in research institutes and laboratories.

The various levels of the organization have always regarded upholding the correct political direction as an important part of cultivating and educating scientific and technical personnel. Especially for young intellectuals, they have been given sincere help to guide them on the path of healthy growth. The Commission has strengthened ideological and political work, and among scientific and technical personnel, it has widely carried out education on patriotism, dedication to national defense, love for the base, self-reliance, and hard work, continuously improving the political quality and ideological awareness of the scientific and technical personnel. In the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the vast majority of scientific and technical personnel have firmly stood with the Party Central Committee.

The Commission has shown concern and care for the lives of intellectuals, striving to solve their worries. It has established 103 worker-children schools and kindergartens, and two vocational schools, effectively solving the problems of children's enrollment in kindergartens and schools. It has ensured necessary guarantees and priorities for scientific and technical personnel in terms of vacations, recuperation, medical care, transportation, and housing. It has also worked to solve the problem of spouses living in different places.

The Commission has gradually adjusted and improved the existing structure of the scientific and technical team, and has made great efforts to supplement scientific and technical talents. Due to the impact of the ten-year chaos, the national defense scientific and technical team once faced a situation where there were no successors. The Party Committee of the Commission, from a strategic height, has early studied countermeasures, formulated measures, and established an annual statistical system for scientific and technical personnel, analyzing the current situation to ensure that the scientific and technical personnel team has successors and is full of vitality. Starting from 1981, on the one hand, it has selected outstanding soldiers from the army to enter colleges and universities for further study and then supplement the army; on the other hand, it has organized forces every year to go to various parts of the country to propagate and mobilize the acceptance of a batch of college graduates who are willing to dedicate themselves to national defense science and technology. It has also allocated talent investment funds to cultivate college students for remote experimental bases. In recent years, more than 10,000 scientific and technical talents have been supplemented.

    从第一颗原子弹爆炸到“银河”亿次电子计算机研制成功，国防科工委的知识分子有着广阔的用武之地，在这里早已蔚然成风的是——
    爱才·育才·用才张
    源明　苏扩善
    党的培养和教育，以及国防科研试验的实践和锻炼，造就了一支具有高度思想觉悟、较高科学技术水平的国防科技干部队伍。从第一颗原子弹爆炸到通信卫星发射成功及“银河”亿次电子计算机研制等任务的圆满完成，都凝结着他们的辛勤劳动和智慧。这支队伍为我国国防现代化建设和发展做出了巨大贡献。仅1985年以来国防科工委所属各单位就获得科技进步成果奖共有6000余项。
    国防科工委各级党组织把尊重知识、尊重人才作为工作的一项重要内容。他们纠正对待知识分子入党问题中存在的脱离实际、求全责备、无限期考验的现象，在保证政治质量的前提下，把培养、发展优秀知识分子入党提到重要议事日程。目前，国防科技干部中党员比例约占61.2％。
    1982年以来，在全委范围内先后三次进行了关于落实知识分子政策工作的检查，1986年还重点对青年知识分子的培养、教育和使用进行了检查，注意总结和推广一些先进的经验；建立了拔尖科技人才档案资料。
    1988年，向长期战斗在国防科研试验第一线的广大科技干部颁发了“献身国防科技事业”荣誉证章和证书，表彰为国防科技事业作出重大贡献的单位和个人。
    放手使用科技干部，为知识分子施展才能提供用武之地，一批优秀知识分子走上了领导岗位。在国防科工委师以上领导班子中，大专以上学历的占73.4％。建立技术岗位责任制，保证科技干部有职、有责、有权。放手将青年知识分子放在科研试验第一线，职称改革以来，为百余名贡献显著的中青年科技干部破格晋升了高级专业技术职务。采取多种方式，拓宽渠道，加强技术培训，加速知识更新，提高科研试验水平。
    1979年以来，有1万人次脱产参加了各类业务培训班，近2万名科技干部参加了岗位达标训练。
    他们还广泛开展国际间的技术合作和交流，并通过多种渠道，搞好人才和智力引进，有重点地选拔优秀科技人员出国学习和培训。先后组织了3000多人次出国进行技术交流和考察；派出近300人出国留学，已有近百人学成归国，绝大多数已成为学术、技术带头人，不少同志已担任了研究所、室的领导。
    各级组织始终把坚持正确的政治方向作为培养教育科技干部的一项重要内容。特别是对青年知识分子给予真诚的帮助，引导他们走健康成长的道路。加强思想政治工作，在科技干部中间广泛开展爱国主义、献身国防事业和热爱场区、自力更生、艰苦奋斗的思想教育，使科技干部队伍的政治素质和思想觉悟不断提高。在这场制止动乱、平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱的斗争中，绝大多数科技干部坚定地和党中央保持一致。
    对知识分子生活上关心照顾，努力解决后顾之忧。先后组建了103所职工子女学校和幼儿园，组建了两所中专学校，妥善解决了干部子女入托难、入学难问题，对科技干部的休假、疗养、医疗保健、用车住房等给予必要的保证和优先；努力解决科技干部夫妻的两地分居问题。
    逐步调整和改善现有科技队伍的结构，花大力气做好科技人才的补充工作。由于十年内乱的影响，国防科技队伍一度面临青黄不接后继乏人的局面。
    国防科工委党委从战略高度出发，及早研究对策，制订措施，并建立了科技干部年度统计制度，分析现状，保证科技干部队伍后继有人，充满活力。从1981年开始，一方面从部队选送优秀战士入院校深造后补充部队；另一方面每年组织力量分赴全国各地，宣传、动员接收一批有志于献身国防科技事业的地方大学毕业生，还拨出人才投资专款，为边远试验基地定向培养大学生。几年来共补充科技人才1万余人。
