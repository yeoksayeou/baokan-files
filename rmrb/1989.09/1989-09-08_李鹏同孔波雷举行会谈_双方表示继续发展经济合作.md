Premier Li Peng of the State Council held a formal talk with Blaise Compaoré, Chairman of the People's Front for Burkina Faso, the Head of State, and the Head of Government, in the Great Hall of the People this morning.

Chairman Compaoré said that although Burkina Faso and China are geographically distant, the two countries share common needs and demands. Over the past 15 years, our two countries have supported each other and cooperated in many fields. In international affairs, we both care about peace in Africa, Asia, and the entire world. We should jointly strive to support the liberation of oppressed nations and peoples. The struggle for national independence in Namibia, in particular, needs China's support. The African continent's economy is still relatively backward, due to both natural conditions and unfair international commodity prices. Africa is facing a serious economic crisis.

He said that in addition to strengthening bilateral cooperation, we should also strengthen South-South cooperation. The bilateral relationship between the two countries should develop more vigorously. To this end, we hope to cooperate with China in a broader range of economic fields.

Premier Li Peng said that African countries have achieved political independence, but their economies are still controlled and exploited by old and new colonialism. The unequal exchange of industrial goods and primary products is an important means adopted by old and new colonialism. They turn underdeveloped countries into bases for plundering raw materials and markets for selling products, burdening underdeveloped countries with heavy debts. The debt issue has become a prominent problem in North-South relations. On these issues, China firmly stands on the side of developing countries.

He said that the world situation is complex. Currently, the main issues in the world are peace and development. As a developing country, China needs a peaceful international environment to develop its economy and improve people's lives. Therefore, we are pleased to see the easing of the world situation because it is in the interest of the Chinese people. However, we also see that the threat of war, especially local wars, still exists. China adheres to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, regarding Africa and all developing countries as reliable friends. We should strengthen mutual support and sympathy. After China's suppression of the riots, a few countries in the world have launched an anti-China trend. However, Third World countries support and sympathize with China. Third World countries understand China because they have similar experiences; they have suffered from imperialist subversion and interference.

Li Peng said that China will continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up, further improving the socialist system. Our economy is based on public ownership, with large and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone, while allowing private and individual economies to exist as supplements. This can both activate the economy and solve the employment problem. We advocate exchanges with the West on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We recognize that developed Western countries have many advantages in science and technology, industrial production, and management. We should learn from them and not close our doors. We also welcome economic organizations and some countries to provide loans to China. Of course, such loans should be equal and mutually beneficial. In addition to science and technology, we do not exclude learning good things from the West in education and culture. On the one hand, we need to exchange with the West, and on the other hand, we need to be vigilant against external subversion.

When talking about the domestic situation in China, Li Peng said that China's economy has also encountered problems, mainly due to the overly fast pace of construction and consumption growth in the previous few years, resulting in inflation. Now we are implementing an adjustment policy, which will take about two to three years to bring down the overly fast development speed and inflation, making the economy develop forward at a reasonable rate. China's most prominent problem is agriculture. The food problem must be solved by ourselves. No country in the world can solve China's food problem. Developing agriculture, improving agricultural production, and ensuring food security are very important for a country's economic independence. This is our own experience. We believe that existing difficulties will be overcome, and we will move forward better.

He also said that China advocates South-North dialogue and South-South cooperation. However, China's economy is currently in an adjustment period and still faces difficulties. We can only provide some assistance within our capacity to friendly countries as a symbol of friendship. This is also a form of South-South cooperation.

Both sides expressed a willingness to continue developing economic cooperation during the talks.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and others participated in the talks.

Before the talks, Chairman Compaoré, accompanied by the leader of the Chinese government delegation and the Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources, Zhu Xun, laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square. The ribbon on the wreath read, "The People's Heroes Will Live Forever."

This morning, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held a separate meeting with Burkina Faso's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Issa Konate.

### 李鹏同孔波雷举行会谈  双方表示继续发展经济合作

    李鹏同孔波雷举行会谈
    双方表示继续发展经济合作
    本报北京9月8日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂同布基纳法索人民阵线主席、国家元首、政府首脑布莱斯·孔波雷举行了正式会谈。
    孔波雷主席说，布中两国在地理上相隔遥远，但两国有着共同的需要和要求。15年来，我们两国相互同情和支持，在很多领域中进行了很好的合作。在国际方面，我们都关心非洲、亚洲以及整个世界的和平。我们应该共同努力支持争取解放的国家和民族。非洲的解放斗争，特别是纳米比亚民族独立的斗争需要中国的支持。非洲大陆的经济还比较落后，这既是由于自然条件，也是由于国际上不合理的原料价格等原因造成的。非洲面临着严重的经济危机。
    他说，我们除加强双边合作外，还应该加强南南合作。两国双边关系应该更加生机勃勃地发展。为此，我们希望同中国在更广泛的领域内进行经济合作。
    李鹏总理说，非洲国家政治上独立了，经济仍然受着新老殖民主义的控制和剥削。工业品和初级产品的不等价交换是新老殖民主义所采取的一个重要方式。它们使不发达国家成为其掠夺原料的基地和推销产品的市场，使不发达国家背上了沉重的债务包袱。债务问题已成为当今南北关系中一个很突出的问题。在这些问题上，中国坚决站在发展中国家一边。
    他说，世界的情况是复杂的。当前，世界上的主要问题是和平与发展。作为发展中国家，中国在发展经济、改善人民生活中需要一个和平的国际环境。因此，我们对世界局势出现缓和是高兴的。因为缓和符合中国人民的利益。但是我们也看到，战争的威胁，特别是局部战争的威胁依然存在。中国奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，把非洲及所有发展中国家看作是我们可靠的朋友。我们应该加强相互支持和同情。这次中国平息暴乱以后，世界上有少数国家掀起一股反华逆流。但是第三世界国家对中国是支持和同情的。第三世界国家对中国表示理解，是因为它们同我们有相似的遭遇，它们遭受过帝国主义的颠覆和干涉。
    李鹏说，中国将继续奉行改革开放政策，进一步完善社会主义制度。我国的经济以公有制为基础，以大中型企业为骨干，同时，作为补充，允许私人和个体经济存在。这样既可活跃经济，也可解决就业问题。我们主张在平等互利的基础上同西方交往。我们承认西方发达国家在科学技术、工业生产和管理等方面有许多长处。我们应该向它们学习，而不应该闭关自守。我们也欢迎世界的经济组织和一些国家向中国提供贷款。当然，这种贷款应当是平等互利的。除科学技术以外，我们也不排除在教育和文化方面吸取西方好的东西。我们一方面要同西方交往，另一方面又要警惕外来的颠覆。
    在谈到中国国内情况时，李鹏说，中国的经济也出现了问题，主要是前几年建设速度过快，消费增长也过快，因而出现了通货膨胀。现在我们实行的实际上是调整的方针，大概需要两三年时间，使过快的发展速度和通货膨胀降下来，使经济以合理的比例向前发展。中国最突出的问题是农业问题。吃饭问题要靠自己解决。世界上任何国家不能为中国解决吃饭问题。把农业搞上去，发展农业，提高农业产量，对一个国家的经济独立是很重要的，这是我们自己的经验。我们相信存在的困难会被克服，我们将会更好地前进。
    他还说，中国主张南北对话和南南合作。但是中国经济现在正处于调整时期，经济还有困难。我们对友好国家只能提供一些力所能及的援助作为友谊的象征，这也是一种南南合作。
    双方在会谈中表示愿意继续发展经济合作。
    中国外交部长钱其琛等参加了会谈。
    会谈前，孔波雷主席在中国政府陪同团团长、地质矿产部部长朱训陪同下，在天安门广场向人民英雄纪念碑敬献了花圈。花圈的缎带上写着“人民英雄永垂不朽”。
    今天上午，外交部长钱其琛与布基纳法索对外关系部长伊素·戈举行了单独会晤。
