The People's Political Consultative Conference was the first place to raise the Five-Star Red Flag.

Forty years ago today, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opened solemnly in Beiping. The meeting decided that the Five-Star Red Flag would be the national flag, that Beiping would be renamed Beijing and made the capital, and that "March of the Volunteers" would be the provisional national anthem. The meeting elected the Central People's Government with Mao Zedong as chairman, proclaiming the birth of New China.

Chairman Mao Zedong solemnly declared to the world in his opening speech at the Political Consultative Conference:

"Our nation will no longer be a nation that is bullied by others. We have stood up!"

Zhào Pǔchǐ: "This is a historic change!"

In the blink of an eye, 40 years have passed. As a representative of the religious community attending this historic gathering, Vice Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference Zhào Pǔchǐ recalls the past with great emotion.

"When we heard Chairman Mao's stirring voice, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause, and we all shed tears of joy: Great China has stood up, this is a historic change."

At 82 years old, Zhào Pǔchǐ has experienced two emperors, warlord conflicts, and foreign invasions. He said that the Chinese people, from the Opium War and the Xinhai Revolution to 1949, fought bravely for an entire century, finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrew the three great mountains. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; this is an indisputable truth.

During the conversation, Zhào Pǔchǐ recited a poem he had just composed for the 40th anniversary of the People's Political Consultative Conference, "Thousand Autumns":

A century of struggle, the three mountains are removed, the evil spirits are cleansed.
Forty years ago, the lion roared: "The Chinese people have stood up!"
Laughing through the ages, heroes of the four seas, unparalleled spirit.
On Tiananmen, both heaven and earth rejoice greatly.

In the blink of an eye, the sea and the land have changed, how much of the old remains?
Even if the wind is fierce and the waves are terrifying, the will is suddenly beyond a thousand miles.
All oars fly together, sharing the same boat, the sage's worries begin.
Mother, my land, the gratitude is endless!

Zhào Pǔchǐ, who has served as a Political Consultative Conference member for seven consecutive terms, said with deep emotion: "Forty years ago, representatives of the religious community participated in the People's Political Consultative Conference and worked with people from all walks of life to prepare for the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This was unprecedented in history. Over the past 40 years, our country has experienced setbacks and made mistakes, traveled a tortuous and winding road, but we have indeed stood up. Foreigners no longer dare to look down on the Chinese people who have stood up!"

"Mother, my land, the gratitude is endless!" Zhào Pǔchǐ explained: "The motherland is our mother. Can a son's gratitude to his mother ever be repaid?"

Sūn Qǐméng: "History has proven it!"

"Without the Communist Party of China, there would be no New China—history has proven it!" In the spring of 1949, Sūn Qǐméng entered Beiping from the Northeast Liberation Area and served as the deputy secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. When he talked about the past, he seemed a bit excited. He spoke in poetic language: "October 1st, that was the day when the thousands and thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of our Chinese nation, sacrificing their heads and shedding their blood, bravely fighting to the death, finally welcomed the dawn after a tenacious, unyielding, and desperate struggle!"

Sūn Qǐméng, currently serving as the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in an interview with the reporter that the birth of New China was announced by Chairman Mao Zedong in his opening speech at the first session of the Political Consultative Conference on September 21, 1949. He excitedly said: "When I heard Chairman Mao announce: 'The People's Republic of China is established,' I couldn't think of anything else, I suddenly stood up and clapped my hands with all my might. No one directed it, everyone in the hall stood up excitedly, everyone's face was flushed, feeling the blood boiling in their bodies, feeling infinitely happy."

Sūn Qǐméng, who refers to himself as an old soldier of the Political Consultative Conference, has maintained close contact with the Political Consultative Conference for decades since the founding of New China. He talked enthusiastically from the first session to the sixth session.

"The fifth session of the National Political Consultative Conference left a very deep impression on me because it was after the smashing of the 'Gang of Four,' implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, completing the rectification of past mistakes. It was also because the chairman of this session was Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and I had the opportunity to work under his direct leadership."

Recalling this period of history, Sūn Qǐméng said, "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's opening speech at the second session of the fifth Political Consultative Conference is still a brilliant and programmatic document."

He believed that in the opening speech, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made two scientific judgments: first, announcing that the capitalist class in our country no longer exists; they have mostly been transformed into laborers and are contributing to the modernization of socialism. Second, the vast majority of intellectuals in our country, including old intellectuals from the old society, have become part of the working class and are consciously serving the cause of socialism.

"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's two majorities can be said to be judgments of historical significance. At the meeting, when Comrade Deng Xiaoping announced that the class situation in our country had undergone fundamental changes, many members of the Political Consultative Conference were moved to tears. Some members celebrated that night, expressing their joy. Many members said that after listening to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, they were full of energy and would work even harder for the construction of the motherland in the future."

"Another major event of the fifth Political Consultative Conference was the amendment of the Political Consultative Conference Charter. This was a work of great significance in the history of the Political Consultative Conference, completed under the leadership of Chairman Deng Xiaoping."

With the demeanor of a scholar, Sūn Qǐméng said firmly as we took our leave:

"My personal experiences have made me excited and inspired, giving me hope and strength."

Chéng Sīyuǎn: "The second golden age!"

Vice Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference and non-partisan personage Chéng Sīyuǎn returned to the country with Mr. Lǐ Zōngrén in 1965. He described the work of the Political Consultative Conference after its activities resumed in 1978 as the "second golden age."

Chéng Sīyuǎn recalled the warm reception he received from Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, and the memories of the party and state leaders consulting with the leaders of the democratic parties and non-partisan patriots on national affairs, were deeply moving.

"Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai created a good tradition of cooperation and joint work with the non-party. Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, and Li Xiannian further carried forward this good tradition in their positions as chairmen of the Political Consultative Conference. Political consultation, democratic supervision, sharing joys and sorrows, this is the crystallization of this good tradition."

He listed the increase in the number of Political Consultative Conference members and representative sectors over the past decade, the progress of proposal work and cross-strait exchanges, and sighed: "The work of the Political Consultative Conference is developing and progressing with each session. This is a vivid manifestation of the party's leadership in the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation."

"Political consultation has many advantages. Many problems have been resolved through repeated sincere consultations to reach a consensus. This is something that those Western countries that claim to be 'democratic' do not have."

Chéng Sīyuǎn excitedly said: "The future of the Political Consultative Conference is bright; the reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend. This is the tide of history. The tide of history is something that no one can stop."

Zhào Pǔchǐ, Sūn Qǐméng, and Chéng Sīyuǎn, three old comrades who have weathered storms with the Communist Party for decades, although their experiences and feelings are different, when they talk about the 40 years of the Political Consultative Conference, they all have this wish—

The People's Republic of China is hard-won. We have the responsibility to make the Five-Star Red Flag shine even brighter.

    让五星红旗更加鲜艳
    ——赵朴初、孙起孟、程思远畅谈人民政协40年
    新华社记者　邹爱国
    人民政协是最早升起五星红旗的地方。
    40年前的今天，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议在北平隆重开幕。会议决定：五星红旗为国旗、改北平为北京，定为首都；《义勇军进行曲》为代国歌。会议选举出以毛泽东为主席的中央人民政府，宣告新中国诞生。
    毛泽东主席在政协开幕词中向世界庄严宣告：
    “我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了！”
    赵朴初：“这是划时代的巨变！”
    弹指一挥间。40年过去了，作为宗教界代表出席这次历史盛会的全国政协副主席赵朴初，回忆往事，依然激动不已。
    “当听到毛主席的震撼人心的声音时，全场掌声雷动，我们都流下了滚滚热泪：伟大的中国站起来了，这是划时代的巨变。”
    82岁的赵朴初，经历过两代皇帝、军阀混战和外国列强的侵略。他说，中国人民从鸦片战争、辛亥革命到1949年，经过整整一个世纪的英勇奋斗，最终在中国共产党领导下，推翻了三座大山。没有共产党就没有新中国，这是千真万确的真理。
    谈话间，赵朴初为记者吟诵起他刚刚为人民政协成立40周年而创作的词《千秋岁》：
    百年奋斗，果三山尽拔，妖氛净洗。四十年前狮子吼：“中国人民站起！”谈笑千秋，豪英四海，意气无伦比。天安门上，人天皆大欢喜。
    弹指沧海桑田，山河改造，旧貌今余几？纵有风狂兼浪骇，猛志顿超千里。众桨齐飞，同舟共济，圣哲殷忧启。母兮吾土，报恩无有穷已！
    赵朴初，这位连任七届的政协委员深情地说：“40年前，宗教界的代表参加人民政协，和各界人士一起筹备中华人民共和国的建立，这是史无前例的事。40年来，我们国家尽管受过挫折，也有过失误，走过曲折迂回的道路，但我们毕竟站起来了，外国人再也不敢小看站起来的中国人民了！”
    “母兮吾土，报恩无有穷已！”赵朴初解释说：“祖国就是我们的母亲，儿子对母亲的恩情难道报得完吗？”
    孙起孟：“历史已经作出证明！”
    “没有中国共产党就没有新中国——历史已经作出证明！”1949年初春，从东北解放区走进北平，担任新政协筹委会副秘书长的孙起孟谈起往事显得有些激动。他用诗一般的语言说道：“10月1日，那是我们中华民族的千千万万优秀儿女，抛头颅、洒热血、英勇牺牲，用顽强、不屈、殊死的斗争才迎来的啊！”
    孙起孟现任全国人大常委会副委员长、中国民主建国会主席，他在接受记者访问时说，新中国的诞生是毛泽东主席在1949年9月21日政协第一届会议开幕词中宣布的。他兴奋地说：“当我听到毛主席宣布：‘中华人民共和国成立了’的时候，我什么也顾不上，猛地站了起来，使出全身力气鼓掌。没有谁指挥，全场的人都兴奋地站了起来，每个人的脸都是通红通红的，觉得全身热血沸腾，感到无限幸福。”
    以政协一名老兵自称的孙起孟，在新中国成立后，几十年来，一直同政协保持着密切联系。他从政协一届谈到六届，兴致极高。
    “五届全国政协，给我留下了极为深刻的印象，因为它是粉碎‘四人帮’以后，贯彻中共十一届三中全会精神，完成拨乱反正的中兴纪元。还因为这一届的主席是邓小平同志，我有机会在他直接领导下工作。”
    回顾这段历史时，孙起孟说，“邓小平同志在政协五届二次会议上致的开幕词，现在仍然是一篇光彩夺目的纲领性文献。”
    他认为邓小平主席在开幕词中有两点科学论断：一是宣布我国的资本家阶级已经不再存在，他们中间的绝大多数已经改造成为劳动者，正在为社会主义现代化建设贡献力量；二是我国广大知识分子，包括从旧社会过来的老知识分子绝大多数已经成为工人阶级的一部分，正在努力自觉地为社会主义事业服务。
      “小平同志的这两个绝大多数，可以说是具有历史意义的论断。在会上，当小平同志宣布我国社会阶级状况发生了根本变化时，许多政协委员热泪盈眶。有些委员当晚开怀畅饮，表示庆贺。不少委员表示，听了小平同志的讲话浑身是劲，今后要更好地为祖国建设贡献一切智能。”
      “五届政协另一件大事是修改政协章程。这是在邓小平主席领导下完成的在政协历史上具有继往开来意义的工作。”
    有着学者风度的孙起孟在我们告辞时，用坚定的口吻说：
  “我这些亲身经历，使我激动、感奋，给我以希望和力量。”
      程思远：“第二个黄金时代！”
    全国政协副主席、无党派人士程思远是1965年同李宗仁先生一起回国的，他用“第二个黄金时代”来形容1978年政协恢复活动后的工作。
    程思远回忆起当年毛泽东主席、周恩来总理亲切会见他的情况，回忆起当年党和国家领导人同民主党派负责人、无党派爱国人士协商国家大事的往事，十分动情。
    “毛主席、周总理开创了同党外合作共事的好传统，邓小平、邓颖超、李先念同志在政协主席的岗位上进一步发扬了这个好传统。政治协商、民主监督，肝胆相照、荣辱与共，正是这种好传统的结晶。”
    他列数了十年来政协委员人数、代表界别的增加，提案工作和海峡两岸联谊工作的进展，感慨地说：“政协工作一届比一届发展，一届比一届前进，这是党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度的生动体现。”
    “政治协商好处很多，许多问题经过多次反复诚恳地协商，取得一致意见，这是那些号称‘民主’的西方国家所没有的。”
    程思远激动地说：“政协工作前程远大；祖国统一，大势所趋。这是历史的潮流。历史潮流是任何人也挡不住的。”
    赵朴初、孙起孟、程思远，三位和共产党风雨同舟几十年的老同志，尽管经历不同，感受不同，在谈起政协40年时，都有这样一个心愿——
    中华人民共和国来之不易，我们有责任让五星红旗放出更加夺目的光彩。
