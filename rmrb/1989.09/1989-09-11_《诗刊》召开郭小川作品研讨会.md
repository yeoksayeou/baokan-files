The Poetry Journal holds a symposium on Guo Xiaochuan's works

This September marks the 70th anniversary of the birth of the late poet Guo Xiaochuan. The editorial department of The Poetry Journal held a symposium on Guo Xiaochuan's poetry in Beijing on September 8. Attendees included Guo Xiaochuan's teachers and friends, as well as younger poets influenced by his work, totaling more than twenty people.

Old, middle-aged, and young poets and critics who participated in the symposium deeply commemorated the outstanding contributions of this poet who died young, and gave a full evaluation of his poetic achievements in terms of thought and art. They pointed out that in today's new situation, it is necessary to further carry forward the revolutionary tradition embodied in Guo Xiaochuan's creations, correct some undesirable tendencies in current poetic creation, and push Chinese revolutionary poetry to a new level.

Speakers at the symposium included Ai Qing, Feng Mu, Ruan Zhangjing, Zhu Ziqi, Zhou Dihuan, Lu Shi, Li Ying, Ge Luo, Yang Zimin, Ke Yan, and Du Hui. The renowned Romanian poet Andrei Zuzun was also invited to attend and spoke at the meeting.
