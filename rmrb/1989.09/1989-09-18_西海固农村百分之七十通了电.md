Formerly known as the "poorest region in China," the Western Sea Cucumber region in southern Ningxia now has 70% of its villages with electricity.

Located in the southern mountains of Ningxia, the Western Sea Cucumber region had only small hydropower stations with a few dozen kilowatts of capacity before 1975. Even the county seats could not guarantee electricity for lighting. Over the past decade since the reform and opening up, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region government has given priority to supporting the development of the power industry in this impoverished region. Currently, all eight counties in this region are directly supplied by the Northwest Power Grid. The electrification rate of towns has increased from 50% in 1979 to 97.4%, and the electrification rate of villages has reached 71.6%.

　　西海固农村百分之七十通了电
    新华社银川9月17日电　（记者王道）昔日被称为“中国贫困之冠”的宁夏西海固地区，如今70％的农村通了电。
    位于宁夏南部山区的西海固地区，1975年以前只有装机容量几十千瓦的小水电站，连县城的照明用电也得不到保证。改革开放以来的10年间，宁夏回族自治区政府重点扶持这个贫困地区发展电力事业。目前这个地区的8个县全部由西北大电网直接供电。乡通电率由1979年的50％增到97.4％，村通电率达71.6％。
