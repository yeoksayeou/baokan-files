Pitești is a major industrial city in southern Romania. Driving north from the city, the scenery along the way is lush with flowers and trees, and the branches are heavy with fruit. Among the picturesque houses and buildings, it is a beautiful sight of a foreign country's early autumn countryside, captivating the eyes. After driving about 10 kilometers and turning into a hilly area, from afar, the layers of green forests stretch endlessly. Up close, the apple trees, which are not very tall, are almost entirely covered in fruit with barely any leaves visible. Despite being supported by concrete pillars, many branches are still bent to the ground. As our car drove through the orchard filled with the strong aroma of apples, a colleague from the *Scînteia* newspaper told us, "This is Romania's famous 'Apple Valley.'"

Romanian friends say that this place is called "Apple Valley" mainly because it is home to Romania's largest fruit research institute—the Pitești-Maracineni Research Institute—which systematically guides the country's fruit research work and has become the center of apple production development. The institute's scientific manager, Ionuț Mihai, introduced that the institute is located in Argeș County, where the total area of orchards reaches 36,000 hectares, accounting for 11% of Romania's total orchard area, making it the largest in the country. The institute was established in 1967 and has 26 stations distributed across Romania's most famous apple-growing regions. Over the past 15 years, through collaborative efforts with various research stations, the institute has cultivated more than 120 excellent new varieties and has promoted its research findings to state farms and cooperatives. They also maintain close ties with research institutions in several countries around the world, exchanging results and strengthening cooperation.

In the institute's reception room, Mihai, the manager, explained to us while letting us taste the fruits just picked from the orchard: bright red apples, golden soft pears, copper-colored sugar pears, pomegranate-like melon pears, and shiny purple plums, as well as black mulberries. These fruits looked like exquisite artworks, with vibrant colors that delighted the eyes. Each had its unique taste, leaving a lasting impression. Mihai, the manager, proudly said that these fruits they produce are not only loved by domestic consumers but are also exported to countries such as the United Kingdom, West Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United States, and Canada. According to statistics, Romania's annual total fruit production value can reach 10 billion lei, which is indeed a significant income.

Due to its significant contributions in research and production, the institute has made remarkable progress. In the past seven years, it has consistently ranked among the top in the national advanced units' evaluations. In 1987 and 1988, it won two first-place awards. If it can secure another first place this year, it will be honored with the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor of Romania." Mihai, the manager, is confident about this because this year's fruit growth is excellent, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

To understand how the institute's research findings are applied in actual production, we followed Mihai into the apple orchard filled with autumn colors. In this world of apples, our first strong impression was the unique cultivation and management methods used here: people generally plant 1,000 to 1,200 apple trees per hectare, with row spacing of 3.6 to 4 meters and plant spacing of 2.5 to 3 meters, limiting the tree height to 3 meters. Through pruning or fixing, the branches are allowed to grow only vertically and not horizontally, maintaining a certain space between the tree crowns, reducing the thickness of the branches, significantly improving ventilation and light conditions, lowering nutrient consumption, and increasing the fruiting rate. Between each row of trees, grass is planted, and drainage pipes are laid under the grass. During droughts, the drip irrigation system installed under the fruit trees can reduce evaporation when watering. During heavy rains, the grass can also retain water and soil, preventing loss. Additionally, this cultivation layout is conducive to mechanized operations such as fertilization, pest control, and fruit picking. Experiments have shown that using the new cultivation method, fruit trees can bear fruit in just 2 to 3 years, while the ordinary cultivation method takes 5 to 6 years. At the same time, the yield is higher than before, with each hectare producing 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms of fruit.

Standing amidst the lush green and vibrant red apple orchard, looking up at the unique scientific research institute that integrates research, design, and production, we were captivated by the autumn scenery of "Apple Valley"! The hardworking and intelligent people of "Apple Valley" dye the autumn colors with their bountiful fruits and spread this enchanting color, symbolizing a harvest, across Romania.

　　苹果谷秋色
　　本报记者　顾玉清
    皮特什蒂是罗马尼亚南部工业重镇。从该市驱车北上，沿途花木葱茏，果实满枝，造型别致的宅舍、楼宇掩映其间，好一派异国初秋田园风光，令人目不暇接。车行约10公里，拐进一片丘陵地带。远看，层层绿林一望无际。近瞧，树干不高的苹果树，几乎只见果子不见叶，尽管用水泥柱撑着，许多树枝还是被压弯到地上。当我们的汽车穿行在这散发出浓烈苹果香气的果林中时，《火花报》的同志告诉我们，这就是罗马尼亚著名的
  “苹果谷”。
    罗马尼亚朋友说，此地之所以被称为“苹果谷”，主要是因为在这里设立了罗马尼亚最大的果园研究所——皮特斯特马拉基勒依研究所，系统地指导着全国果园的科研工作，成为苹果生产发展的中心。研究所的科学经理杨库·米哈依介绍说，该所位于阿尔杰什县境内，全县果园面积达36000公顷，占罗马尼亚果园总面积的11％，为全国之首。该研究所创建于1967年，下设26个站，分布在罗马尼亚最有名的苹果区。15年来，研究所经过与各研究站的协同努力，培育出120多个优良新品种，并将科研成果推广普及到国营农场和合作社。他们还与世界上一些国家的研究机构保持密切联系，交流成果，加强合作。
    在研究所的会客室里，米哈依经理边给我们讲解，边让我们品尝刚刚从果园里采来的果子：通红的苹果，金黄色的软梨，紫铜色的糖梨，石榴样的葫芦梨，还有紫得发亮的李子，墨黑的杨莓，如同一件件精心雕刻出来的艺术品，看起来五颜六色，令人赏心悦目。吃起来，各有千秋，叫人回味无穷。米哈依经理自豪地说，他们生产的这些水果，不但深受国内消费者的喜爱，而且还向英国、西德、荷兰、瑞典、苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、美国和加拿大等国家出口。据统计，罗马尼亚水果年总产值可达100亿列伊，这确是一项可观的收入。
    该研究所由于在科研和生产方面作出较大贡献，取得了显著进步，最近7年来，在全国先进单位的评比中，一再名列前茅。1987年和1988年两年获得两个第一名。如果今年能再拿一个第一名，就能荣膺罗马尼亚社会主义劳动英雄称号。米哈依经理对此确信不疑。因为今年水果长势良好，丰收在望。
    为了解该所科研成果运用于实际生产的情况，我们随米哈依同志踏进了秋色满园的苹果园。在这个苹果的世界里，我们得到的第一强烈印象，是这里所采取的独特栽培和管理方法：人们一般每公顷植苹果树1000—1200株，行距3.6—4米，株距2.5—3米，树高限制在3米。通过剪枝或固定，树枝只允许往纵向生长，而不能朝横向发展，使树冠之间保持一定的空间，减少了树枝的厚度，大大改善了通风、透光的条件，降低了养分消耗，提高了结果率。在每行树之间的空地上都种上草，草地下铺设了排水管道，每逢干旱，果树下安装的喷灌或滴水慢灌系统浇水时，草地可起到减少蒸发的作用。暴雨时，草地又能保持水土防止流失。另外，这种栽培布局还有利于施肥、除虫、摘果等机械化作业。实验证明，采用新的栽培法果树只需2—3年就能结果，而用普通栽培法则需5—6年。同时，产量也比原来的高，每公顷可收获果子20000—25000公斤。
    置身于翠绿艳红的苹果园里，仰望那果树环抱，融研究、设计、生产为一体的独特科学研究所，我们为“苹果谷”初秋的景色所陶醉！勤劳智慧的“苹果谷”人以自己丰硕的果实点染着秋色，并将这象征着丰收的迷人色彩铺向罗马尼亚各地。（附图片）
