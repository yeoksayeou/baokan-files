The People's Republic of China has been established for forty years, and the Communist Party of China has also traversed a forty-year glorious journey. These forty years of history are a testament to the Communist Party of China leading the people of all ethnic groups in the country to persist in the socialist path and achieve tremendous successes; it is a history of the Communist Party of China, through repeated practice, increasingly integrating Marxist basic principles with China's specific realities, making itself more mature. Forty years of history have once again proven that the core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no socialist New China. This is an unshakable truth.

Over the past forty years, the Communist Party of China has led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to build a powerful socialist state and has begun to find a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Communist Party of China has not only grown stronger but also more mature. Although there have been errors and mistakes during this period, overall, the history of our party is a glorious one. The principle of adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China is unshakable.

Forty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In the past twenty-eight years, we have only accomplished one thing, which is to win the victory of the revolutionary war. This is worth celebrating, but the work we have done so far is only the first step of a ten-thousand-mile journey. The road ahead is long, and we have a serious construction task in front of us. The things we are familiar with are about to be put aside, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do them. We must learn the things we do not understand, and we can learn the things we did not understand before. We are not only good at destroying an old world; we will also be good at building a new world."

Forty years have passed, and the actual situation is as follows: the historical answer is affirmative.

In the past forty years, our party has gone through four development periods.

From October 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, to 1956, was a period of seven years during which the basic completion of socialist transformation was achieved. During this period, our party led the people of the whole country to gradually realize the transition from New Democracy to socialism, rapidly restored the national economy, and carried out planned economic construction. The basic completion of the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production. Practice has proven that the guiding principles and basic policies determined by the party in the first seven years after the founding of the country are correct, and the victories achieved are brilliant.

From 1957 to the eve of the "Cultural Revolution," was a period of ten years during which the comprehensive construction of socialism began. During these ten years, although there were serious mistakes in the guiding principles of the party's work, such as the expansion of class struggle, impatience, and impatience in transition, the main aspect of the party's work was correct. The party put forward many correct ideas in politics, economy, science, culture, education, and other fields, formulated a series of specific policies suitable for the situation at that time, accumulated important experience in leading socialist construction, and achieved great success. The material and technological foundation on which we rely for modernization construction today was largely built up during this period. The backbone of the national economy and culture and their work experience were also largely cultivated and accumulated during this period.

During the "Cultural Revolution," our party made a comprehensive and long-term mistake, bringing serious disasters to the people. However, during this period, not everything in the party was bad. The nature of the party did not change. The party led the people to achieve certain successes in some fields. The struggle of the vast number of party members against the "Left" deviation and the counter-revolutionary cliques of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing never stopped. Most of the party cadres, whether they were wrongly persecuted or continued to work and gradually resumed work, were loyal to the party and the people, and their belief in socialism and communism was firm.

In October 1976, our party smashed the counter-revolutionary clique of Jiang Qing, bringing our country into a new period of development. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the party has thoroughly corrected the "Left" errors made during the "Cultural Revolution" and before, decisively stopped the slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link," which is not applicable to a socialist society, and made the strategic decision to shift the focus of work to socialist modernization construction. The four basic principles and the general policy of reform and opening up were put forward. Ten years of reform, ten years of great changes. The earth-shaking changes that have taken place in our country have laid the foundation for future great development and great changes.

The achievements made by the party's work in the past forty years are tremendous. The main manifestations are as follows: (1) The state power of people's democratic dictatorship has been established and consolidated, and national unity and great unity of all ethnic groups in the country have been achieved (except for Taiwan and other islands). (2) The aggression, sabotage, and armed provocations of imperialism and hegemony have been overcome, and the security and independence of the country have been safeguarded. (3) The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, and the socialist economy has been established and developed. (4) The conditions for agricultural production have undergone significant changes, the production level has been greatly improved, and the vast majority of the 1.1 billion people have achieved a life of basic subsistence, and some regions have begun to move towards a moderately prosperous life. (5) An independent and relatively complete industrial system has been established, and great achievements have been made in industrial construction. (6) Education, science, culture, health, and sports have developed significantly. (7) The People's Liberation Army has continued to grow and improve. Recently, the rapid suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has consolidated and developed the political situation of stability and unity. (8) Our country's international status is increasingly high, and it is playing an increasingly active role in international affairs. All of these are ironclad facts recognized by the world.

It is particularly worth noting that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party, based on the summary of the positive and negative experiences of the past forty years, and based on the study of foreign experience and the world situation, has begun to find a path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulated a basic line with one center and two basic points as the core content, and opened up a new stage of socialist construction. Ten years of practice have proven that the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is a correct Marxist line, which is the fundamental guarantee for the people to achieve new victories in socialist modernization construction.

Looking back at the forty-year history of the Communist Party of China, it is not difficult to see that although our party has made many mistakes, including the serious mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution," and some of our systems are not yet perfect, we have eliminated the exploiting classes and the system of exploitation, established the socialist system, and made nearly one-quarter of the world's population enter a new socialist society. The Chinese people have stood up firmly, and China's comprehensive national strength has been unprecedentedly enhanced. The gap with developed countries has been greatly narrowed. On the whole, the history of our party is still a glorious one.

Forty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The Communist Party of China has already walked for twenty-eight years. It is no longer a child, nor a young man in his teens, but an adult." After these forty years, our party has not only grown stronger but also more mature. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "Compared to the Eighth Congress, our party now has a much deeper understanding of the laws of socialist construction in our country, much richer experience, and the self-awareness and firmness in implementing our correct policies have been greatly strengthened." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 371) Our party has achieved another historic leap in the process of integrating Marxism with our country's practice.

Forty years of practice have proven: our party is indeed a proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people wholeheartedly, and is a party that has been tested by history, gained extremely rich experience and lessons, and has the ability to lead the Chinese people to build a socialist modernized strong country. The principle that China is led by the Communist Party and that the cause of socialist modernization construction in China is led by the Communist Party is absolutely unshakable.

The "corruption theory" is a fallacy created by those who stubbornly insist on bourgeois liberalization. Regarding the situation of the Communist Party of China, there should be a basic assessment. Although there are indeed phenomena of corruption among a few party members, overall, our party is clean and upright. The Communist Party of China is the main force against corruption. It is fundamentally wrong to use the pretext of anti-corruption to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

The "corruption theory" is a pretext for those who stubbornly insist on bourgeois liberalization to try to overthrow the party's leadership. On the one hand, they fabricate lies and incite everywhere, saying, "The CCP has become corrupt to an astonishing extent"; on the other hand, they dress themselves up as "heroes" of anti-corruption, using the masses' dissatisfaction with some corrupt phenomena within the party to create disturbances and counter-revolutionary rebellions. It must be admitted that in recent years, some phenomena of corruption have indeed occurred within our party, especially the behavior of certain leading cadres using their power for personal gain and being corrupt in their administration, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among the masses. We cannot turn a blind eye to this and let it develop. However, can we say that our party has already become a corrupt party? No. On this point, we must not confuse right and wrong and spread fallacies.

Overall, although some phenomena of corruption have appeared within the party in recent years, the main trend of the party is good, and the healthy forces are in the dominant position. Our party is a clean and upright party. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has restored and carried forward the fine traditions of combining theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing. The party's line and policies represent the greatest interests of the broad masses of the people and promote the development of productive forces. Party organizations at all levels and the vast majority of party members and cadres actively and loyally serve the people, showing great practical spirit and creative power. The vast majority of party members have a firm belief in communism and can subordinate personal interests to collective interests, immediate interests to long-term interests, and local interests to overall interests, and can resist the erosion of various decadent ideologies and styles. In the ranks of party members, not only have a large number of advanced elements who work hard and innovate emerged, but also a large number of model party members and cadres who are public-spirited, reject corruption, and are clean in their administration have emerged. According to a recent survey by the Organization Department of the Central Committee on 1.49 million party members in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, 45.8% performed well in playing a vanguard and exemplary role, and 45.7% performed relatively well. Of the 15 comrades who were awarded the title of National Labor Model by the State Council in 1987 and 1988, all were Communist Party members. Among the 4,304 recipients of the "May 1st Labor Medal" awarded by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, 79% were Communist Party members. The truly unqualified party members and the party organizations that are in a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis are only a very small number. Practice has proven that our party can withstand the test of being in power and reform and opening up.

The reason why our party can maintain justice and integrity is fundamentally determined by the nature and purpose of the party. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the faithful representative of the interests of all ethnic groups in China. Therefore, it has a strong internal driving force to maintain integrity and combat corruption. From the composition of the party organization, the Communist Party of China is composed of the most advanced elements of the working class. These advanced elements can not only set an example in their work but also take the lead in fighting against various corrupt phenomena. From the guiding ideology, the Communist Party of China has always taken Marxism as the theoretical basis of the party's guiding ideology, striving to use the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism to correctly understand itself, analyze itself, and rely on its own strength to continuously develop and grow in the process of exposing and solving contradictions. From the purpose of the party, since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has taken serving the people wholeheartedly as the sole purpose of the party. As Marx and Engels said in The Communist Manifesto: "The movement of the proletariat is the independent movement of the vast majority for the vast majority." The Communists "have no interests separate and apart from the interests of the proletariat as a whole." "The Communists emphasize and insist on the common interests of the proletariat as a whole, regardless of nationality." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 1, p. 262, 264) This is the fundamental sign and fundamental driving force for our party to maintain integrity. From the style of the party, the fine traditions of combining theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, criticizing and self-criticizing, being modest and prudent, and working hard and striving forward that the party has formed in long-term practice are important guarantees for the party to combat corruption and maintain integrity.

Our party not only has the strength and conditions to combat corruption and maintain integrity but is also consistently and resolutely fighting against corruption. As early as before the founding of the country, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried style, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard work and self-reliance." After the founding of the country, while our party has been tirelessly carrying out education on anti-corruption and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, it has also taken various measures to punish some corrupt phenomena within the party. In the 1950s and 1960s, our party launched and led a series of large-scale anti-corruption struggles such as the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns, and the "Rectification and Purification of the Party," and expelled a batch after another of corrupt elements from the party. Leaders like Liu Qingyan and Zhang Zishan, who held leading positions, were also severely punished by law. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has paid more attention to the issue of anti-corruption. The Central Committee and the central leading comrades have repeatedly emphasized that the issue of the party's style is a matter of life and death for the party, and have taken the rectification of the party's style and the combating of corrupt phenomena within the party as an important long-term task of party building. While strengthening ideological education within the party, large-scale campaigns to combat economic crimes have been launched in a timely manner, and party members' illegal and criminal problems have been seriously dealt with. According to the needs of the anti-corruption struggle, the Central Committee, the National People's Congress, and the State Council have also taken a series of measures in organizational settings and legislation, successively restoring and establishing disciplinary inspection, supervision, auditing, and procuratorial organs, promulgating several laws and regulations, and strengthening party discipline, administrative discipline, and the rule of law. The Thirteenth National Congress clearly proposed the policy of strict party governance, requiring that corrupt elements who damage the cause of the party and the people be immediately and decisively expelled and that no indulgence be shown. Since last year, the Central Committee has also promoted the "two openness and one supervision" and the mass reporting system nationwide. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee put forward the resolute punishment of corruption as one of the four major tasks that must be paid special attention to at present and brought it to the attention of the whole party. Recently, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a few things that the masses are concerned about in the near future." Local party and government organs have also put forward specific requirements in light of their own actual situations and have begun to take action. The vast majority of party members have always been deeply disgusted with corruption and have been fighting against it tirelessly. These facts show that our party has always attached great importance to anti-corruption, and the true main force against corruption is our party itself, not the few who engage in bourgeois liberalization and create disturbances.

Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In this incident, the slogans are relatively concentrated on anti-corruption. Of course, this slogan is an accompaniment for them, and their purpose is to use anti-corruption to deceive people. But for us, to rectify our party and achieve our strategic goals, we must oppose corruption. If we do not punish corruption, especially corruption within the party, there is indeed a risk of failure. We must recognize the significance of anti-corruption, distinguish between two different kinds of anti-corruption, and seriously eliminate the corrupt phenomena within the party, so that our party can develop in a healthier way."

The "multi-party system" and the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China are fundamentally different. Its essence is to establish a party in China that is opposed to the Communist Party, negate the leadership of the Communist Party, which is contrary to the historical development of the Chinese revolution and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, and is fundamentally unworkable.

Those who stubbornly insist on bourgeois liberalization keep repeating that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is "one-party dictatorship" and an obstacle to "democratic politics," and the only way out is to implement "multi-party politics" like the West. The essence of this view is to establish a party in China that is opposed to the Communist Party, negate the leading position of the Communist Party. This view is contrary to the historical development of the Chinese revolution and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, and is fundamentally unworkable.

What kind of political system is the multi-party system in the West? What is its essence? The multi-party system in the West refers to the long-term existence of three or more evenly matched political parties within a country ruled by the bourgeoisie. To maintain their own interests, they adopt a political system of several parties jointly governing or taking turns governing. This system is a product of the mutual struggle and compromise between various factions of the bourgeoisie. On the surface, it seems very democratic for one party to take office and another to step down, but in essence, it is the dictatorship of the "one party" of the bourgeoisie, ultimately serving the interests of a few exploiters, and is a deception of the working people. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "What are the advantages of the multi-party system in capitalist countries? That multi-party system is determined by the competitive state of mutual struggle among the bourgeoisie. They do not represent the interests of the broad masses of laborers." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 231) This is in line with reality.

Our country is a socialist state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The fundamental interests of the people of the whole country are consistent. To realize their fundamental interests, they need a unified leadership force and leadership core to unite the strength of hundreds of millions of people. This leadership force and leadership core can only be the proletarian party—the Communist Party of China. History has proven that in China, since the May Fourth Movement seventy years ago, except for the Communist Party of China, there has never been a party that is connected with the broad laboring masses, serves the people wholeheartedly, and can shoulder the heavy responsibility of leading the Chinese revolution and construction. The leading position and role of the Communist Party of China in the cause of the Chinese people's revolution are determined by the interests and will of the people of all ethnic groups in China and by history. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class, and the working class has no narrow class interests. Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests, so there is no need to split the working class into two or more opposing parties to take turns governing. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has been a unified whole, and the party does not allow factionalism or the formation of two or more opposing parties. Therefore, it is neither necessary nor possible to have an opposition party in China. If an opposition party that is opposed to the Communist Party is allowed to exist, it is to allow a political force that damages the interests of the people to exist, which will cause turmoil in the country and bring disaster to the people. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

Our country is also a multi-party country. In addition to the Communist Party, there are eight democratic parties. Each democratic party has a glorious history in the democratic revolution and has also made important contributions in the socialist transformation. Now, in terms of their basic composition, all democratic parties have become political alliances of a part of socialist laborers and a part of patriots who support socialism, and are political forces serving socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party successfully solved the problem of cooperation between the Communist Party and the democratic parties by integrating Marxism's theory of establishing a revolutionary united front with China's specific practice, and established the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is a characteristic and advantage of our country's political system, determined by China's specific historical and real conditions, and also determined by the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people, including the democratic parties. This system is conducive to giving full play to the role of the democratic parties in the construction of socialist modernization, conducive to the construction of socialist democratic politics, and conducive to the unification of the motherland and the realization of the concept of "one country, two systems."

The system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is fundamentally different from the multi-party system of capitalism. The system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is a concrete manifestation of socialist democracy, representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people; the multi-party system of capitalism is a political system of capitalism, and its essence is the dictatorship of the "one party" of the bourgeoisie, representing the interests of the bourgeoisie. The democratic parties in our country participate in the state power and jointly deliberate on state affairs on the premise of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and on the basis of the four basic principles. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The other parties in China serve the cause of socialism on the premise of acknowledging the leadership of the Communist Party." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 281) They are not the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition party in capitalist countries. The Communist Party and the democratic parties have a common political foundation, a common goal of struggle, and common fundamental interests, so they can coexist for a long time, supervise each other, share weal and woe, and cooperate sincerely, rather than struggle and sabotage each other like bourgeois parties. Therefore, it is an important task for us to firmly and unshakably develop and improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and to resolutely oppose all actions that attempt to implement "multi-party politics" in China.

We must focus on party building. To adhere to the leadership of the party, we must improve the leadership of the party, and the two are unified. We must always persist in taking the work of strengthening party building as a long-term task.

As early as 32 years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Does the Communist Party have the qualifications to lead? This is determined by ourselves." History has fully proven that the Communist Party of China is qualified to lead the cause of socialist modernization in China, and the various slanders and attacks on the party by those who engage in bourgeois liberalization must be thoroughly criticized. However, we must also be soberly aware that in the new situation of reform and opening up, many new problems have indeed emerged within the party, and some problems are quite serious. These problems not only affect the party's prestige among the masses but also affect the play of the party's leadership role. The main reason for the emergence of these problems is that Comrade Zhao Ziyang relaxed party building in recent years. In view of this situation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly proposed, "We must focus on party building," which is an important conclusion drawn on the basis of summarizing the experiences and lessons of party building in recent years.

Party building must be closely linked with the party's basic line. The party's basic line is the guiding light for party building, and party building is the fundamental guarantee for the realization of the party's basic line. We must use the party's basic line to unify the thoughts and actions of the whole party. We must strengthen education on adhering to the four basic principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and correct the ideological and theoretical problems that have been confused by bourgeois liberalization. We must strengthen party organizational building according to the requirements of the party's basic line. At present, we must focus on investigating the ideological understanding and actual performance of leading cadres at all levels in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Those who can firmly implement the party's basic line, especially those who have performed outstandingly in this struggle, should be selected to various leading cadres according to the needs, and resolutely expel the enemy elements, anti-party elements, and corrupt elements within the party, purify the party organization, and ensure that the leadership at all levels is firmly in the hands of true Marxists. We must use the actual effects of implementing the party's basic line to examine the good or bad of the party's work, and strive to build our party into a party that can stand at the forefront of reform and modernization construction with a new appearance, a party that is bold in reform and full of vitality, a party that is disciplined and clean, and a party that selects the able and serves the people effectively.

We must take the study of Marxist basic theory as the fundamental task of party ideological building. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out early on that party cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, must have some time to study Marxist basic theory in their busy work, thereby strengthening the principles, system, foresight, and creativity in our work. However, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction has not been well implemented. Many problems that have emerged within the party in recent years are related to neglecting the study of Marxist basic theory. Based on the practice of the past few years, it is not enough to have a general call for the study of Marxist basic theory; there must also be a feasible system to guarantee it. Party organizations at all levels must put the study of Marxist basic theory on the important agenda, and party committee members and party leading cadres must take the lead in studying. We must adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice, change the objective world and the subjective world, firmly establish the Marxist worldview, and firmly establish the lofty ideal of communism. We must have a specific study plan and quickly compile textbooks suitable for people at different levels. At the same time, we must also take the good or bad of study achievements and the high or low level of Marxist theoretical level as an important basis for the examination and use of cadres. We must take various measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of party members to study Marxism, and create a strong atmosphere of studying Marxism in the whole party.

We must raise the level of party style building to a new height. The issue of party style is a matter of life and death for the party. To strengthen party style building, we must currently make great efforts to combat corruption. To prevent corruption, we must advocate the style of hard work and self-reliance. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:

"Hard work and self-reliance is our tradition. We must strengthen the education of hard work and self-reliance in the future, and continue to do so for 60 to 70 years. The more our country develops, the more we must grasp hard work and self-reliance. Advocating the spirit of hard work and self-reliance also helps to combat corrupt phenomena. Since the founding of the country, we have always advocated hard work and self-reliance. Later, when life became a little better, we advocated high consumption, and thus, wasteful phenomena spread in all aspects. Coupled with weak ideological and political work and imperfect legal systems, various illegal and undisciplined and corrupt phenomena emerged." We must be soberly aware: hard work and self-reliance is the sharp weapon of the proletarian party to resist corruption in construction and reform, the working style of proletarian revolutionaries in practice, and also the way of life of every true Communist Party member. We must recognize hard work and self-reliance from such a height, self-motivate, and practice it, so that there can be a fundamental change in the style of our party.

We must strengthen party institutional building and reform the leadership system of the party and the state. To strengthen party leadership and improve party leadership, we must make some regulations in the party's institutions and reform the leadership system of the party and the state. The main task of party institutional building is to improve the various systems within the party based on democratic centralism. We must improve democratic centralism, institutionalize the collective leadership of the party; improve the system of party congresses, guarantee the democratic rights of party members; improve the supervision system of the party, and strengthen party institutional building. Under the new historical conditions, we must reform the leadership system of the party and the state and implement the separation of party and government. The purpose of implementing the separation of party and government is to strengthen the political leadership of the party. Any action that uses the pretext of the separation of party and government to weaken the leadership of the party is wrong.

Focusing on party building is the need to adhere to and improve the leadership of the party. Adhering to the leadership of the party and improving the leadership of the party are dialectically unified. Only by adhering to the leadership of the party can we talk about improving the leadership of the party. Only by improving the leadership of the party can we truly adhere to the leadership of the party and strengthen the leadership of the party. Using the pretext of improving the leadership of the party to weaken the leadership of the party and negate the leadership of the party is fundamentally wrong. If we are afraid of weakening the leadership of the party and relax improving the leadership of the party, the leadership of the party will lose its vitality. Adhering to the leadership of the party is a long-term task, and improving the leadership of the party is also a long-term task. We must correctly handle the relationship between adhering to and improving, and always persist in taking party building as a long-term task.

    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党
    郭方
    中华人民共和国成立四十年了，中国共产党又走过了四十年的光辉历程。这四十年的历史，是中国共产党领导全国各族人民坚持社会主义道路取得巨大成就的历史；是中国共产党在反复实践中，把马克思主义基本原理同中国具体实际愈益结合，使自身更加成熟的历史。四十年的历史再次证明，领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党，没有共产党就没有社会主义的新中国。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    四十年来，中国共产党领导全国各族人民建设起一个强大的社会主义国家，开始找到了一条有中国特色的社会主义道路。中国共产党不仅更加壮大了，而且更加成熟了。尽管这一时期出现过错误和失误，但总的来说，我们党的历史还是光辉的历史。坚持中国共产党领导的原则是不能动摇的。
    四十年前，毛泽东同志这样说过，党的二十八年，我们仅仅做了一件事，这就是取得了革命战争的胜利。这是值得庆祝的，但是，过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。未来的路很长，严重的建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟悉的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟悉的东西正在强迫我们去做。我们必须学会自己不懂的东西，我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。
    四十个春秋过去了，实际情况怎么样？历史的回答是肯定的。
    在过去的四十年中，我们党经历了四个发展时期。
    从1949年10月中华人民共和国成立到1956年，是基本完成社会主义改造的7年。在这个时期，我们党领导全国人民有步骤地实现了从新民主主义到社会主义的转变，迅速恢复了国民经济并开展了有计划的经济建设，基本完成了生产资料私有制的社会主义改造。实践证明，党在建国后头7年所确定的指导方针和基本政策是正确的，取得的胜利是辉煌的。
    从1957年到“文化大革命”前夕，是开始全面建设社会主义的十年。在这十年中，虽然党的工作在指导方针上有过阶级斗争扩大化、急于求成、急于过渡的严重失误，但党的工作的主导方面是正确的，党在政治、经济、科学、文化、教育等方面提出了许多正确的思想，制定了一系列适合当时情况的具体政策，积累了领导社会主义建设的重要经验，取得了很大成就。我们现在赖以进行现代化建设的物质技术基础，很大一部分是这个时期建设起来的，全国经济文化建设等方面的骨干力量和他们的工作经验，大部分也是在这个期间培养和积累起来的。
    “文化大革命”期间，我们党犯了全局性、长时间的错误，给人民带来了严重灾难。但是，在这个阶段，也不是党的一切都坏了。党的性质没有变。党领导人民在一些领域也取得了一定的成就。广大党员同“左”倾错误和林彪、江青反革命集团的斗争一直没有停止过。党的干部无论是曾被错误打倒的，或是一直坚持工作和先后恢复工作的，绝大多数是忠于党和人民的，对社会主义、共产主义的信念是坚定的。
    1976年10月，我们党粉碎了江青反革命集团，使我们的国家进入了新的发展时期。十一届三中全会以来，党全面地认真地纠正了“文化大革命”中及其以前的“左”倾错误，果断停止了“以阶级斗争为纲”这个不适用于社会主义社会的口号，作出了把工作重点转移到社会主义现代化建设上来的战略决策，提出了四项基本原则和改革开放的总方针。十年改革，十年巨变。我们国家发生的翻天覆地的变化，为今后的大发展、大变化奠定了基础。
    四十年来，我们党的工作所取得的成就是巨大的。其主要表现：（1）建立和巩固了人民民主专政的国家政权，实现了全国范围（除台湾等岛屿外）的国家统一和全国各族人民的大团结。（2）战胜了帝国主义、霸权主义的侵略、破坏和武装挑衅，维护了国家的安全和独立。（3）基本上完成了对生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，建立和发展了社会主义经济。（4）农业生产条件发生了显著变化，生产水平有了很大提高，十一亿人口的绝大多数过上了温饱生活，部分地区开始向小康生活前进。（5）建立了独立的比较完整的工业体系，工业建设取得了重大成就。（6）教育、科学、文化、卫生、体育事业有了很大发展。（7）中国人民解放军得到继续壮大提高。最近迅速平息了北京发生的反革命暴乱，安定团结的政治局面得到了巩固和发展。（8）我国在国际上的地位越来越高，在国际事务中发挥着越来越大的积极作用。所有这些都是举世公认的铁的事实。
    特别值得注意的是，十一届三中全会以来，我们党在总结建国以来正反两方面经验的基础上，在研究外国经验和世界形势的基础上，开始找到了一条建设有中国特色的社会主义的道路，制定了一条以一个中心、两个基本点为中心内容的基本路线，开辟了社会主义建设的新阶段。十年的实践证明，十一届三中全会以来的路线是一条马克思主义的正确路线，是引导人民取得社会主义现代化建设新胜利的根本保证。
    纵观中国共产党这四十年的历史，不难看出，尽管我们党也犯过不少错误，包括“文化大革命”那样严重的错误，我们的一些制度也还不那么完善，但我们已经消灭了剥削阶级和剥削制度，确立了社会主义制度，使占世界人口近1／4的中国进入了人类崭新的社会主义社会，中国人民坚强地站起来了，中国的综合国力空前增强了，同发达国家的差距毕竟是大大缩小了。总的说来，我们党的历史还是光辉的历史。
    四十年前，毛泽东同志曾说，中国共产党已经走过二十八年了，已经不是小孩子，也不是十几岁的年轻小伙子，而是一个大人了。经过这四十年，我们党不仅更加壮大，而且更加成熟了。诚如邓小平同志所说的，“和八大的时候比较，现在我们党对我国社会主义建设规律的认识深刻得多了，经验丰富得多了，贯彻执行我们的正确方针的自觉性和坚定性大大加强了。”
  （《邓小平文选》第371页）我们党在马克思主义与我国实践相结合的过程中，实现了又一次历史性飞跃。
    四十年的实践证明：我们的党，确实是一个用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的、全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级政党，确实是一个久经考验，获得了极其丰富的经验和教训，有能力领导中国人民建设社会主义现代化强国的党。中国由共产党领导，中国的社会主义现代化建设事业由共产党领导，这个原则是绝不能动摇的。
      “腐败论”是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人制造的一个谬论。对于中国共产党的状况，要有一个基本的估计。党内少数人的腐败现象确实存在，但总的来说，我们党是清正廉洁的。中国共产党是反腐败的主导力量。借口反腐败来反对中国共产党的领导是根本错误的。
      “腐败论”是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人企图推翻党的领导的一个借口。他们一方面编造谎言，到处煽动说：“中共腐化已到了惊人的地步”；另一方面把自己打扮成反腐败的“英雄”，利用群众对党内某些腐败现象的不满情绪，制造动乱和反革命暴乱。应该承认，近几年来在我们党内确实发生了一些腐败现象，尤其是某些领导干部以权谋私、为政不廉的行为，已经引起了群众的强烈不满。对此，我们不能视而不见，任其发展。但是，能否说我们的党已经是一个腐败了的党呢？不能。在这一点上，绝不能颠倒是非、谬种流传。
    从总体上看，尽管近几年来党内出现了一些腐败现象，但党的主流是好的，健康力量是占主导地位的，我们党是一个清政廉洁的党。十一届三中全会以来，我们党恢复和发扬了理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评与自我批评的优良作风。党的路线和政策，代表了广大人民群众的最大利益，推动了社会生产力的发展。各级党组织和广大党员，绝大多数的党员干部，积极地忠诚地为人民服务，表现了很大的实干精神和创造力量。绝大多数党员对共产主义的理想和信念是坚定的，能够做到个人利益服从集体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，局部利益服从全局利益，能够抵制各种腐朽思想和作风的侵蚀。在党员队伍中，不仅涌现了大批埋头苦干、勇于创新的先进分子，而且也涌现了大批公而忘私、拒腐蚀、永不沾、为政清廉的模范党员和干部。据中组部前不久对16个省、自治区、直辖市149万名党员的调查，发挥先锋模范作用好的占45.8％，比较好的占45.7％。1987年和1988年国务院授予全国劳动模范称号的15名同志，全部都是共产党员。全国总工会授予的4304名“五一劳动奖章”获得者中，共产党员占79％。真正不合格的党员，处于瘫痪、半瘫痪状态的党组织只是极少数。实践证明，我们党是能够经得起执政和改革开放的考验的。
    我们党所以能够保持公正廉洁，从根本上说，是由党的性质和宗旨决定的。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是中国各族人民利益的忠实代表，因而她有保持清正廉洁，克服腐败的强大的内在动力。从党的组织成分看，中国共产党是由工人阶级的最有觉悟的先进分子所组成，这些先进分子不仅能够在工作中做模范，而且也能够在同各种腐败现象作斗争中打先锋。从党的指导思想看，中国共产党始终把马克思主义作为党的指导思想的理论基础，努力运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，正确认识自己，解剖自己，依靠自己的力量不断在揭露矛盾、解决矛盾的过程中发展壮大。从党的宗旨看，中国共产党成立以后，就把全心全意为人民服务作为党的唯一宗旨，正如马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中所说：“无产阶级的运动是绝大多数人的、为绝大多数人谋利益的独立的运动。”共产党人“没有任何同整个无产阶级的利益不同的利益”，“共产党人强调和坚持整个无产阶级的不分民族的共同利益”。（《马克思恩格斯选集》第1卷，第262、264页）这是我们党保持清正廉洁的根本标志和根本动力。从党的作风看，党在长期的实践中形成的理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评与自我批评、谦虚谨慎、艰苦奋斗等优良作风，是党克服腐败，保持公正廉洁的重要保证。
    我们党不仅有力量、有条件克服腐败现象，保持清正廉洁，而且是一贯地坚决地同腐败现象作斗争的。早在建国前夕，毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会上就提出：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”。建国以后，我们党在向全党坚持不懈地进行反对腐败和发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神教育的同时，采取了各种措施惩治了党内的某些腐败现象。五六十年代，我们党发动和领导了大规模的“三反”、“五反”、“整党整风”等一系列反腐败斗争，将一批又一批腐化分子清除出党，像刘青山、张子善那样的担负领导职务的人还受到了法律严厉制裁。十一届三中全会以来，我们党更加重视反腐败问题，党中央和中央领导同志反复强调执政党的党风问题是关系党的生死存亡的问题，并把端正党风，克服党内腐败现象作为党的建设的长期的重要任务来抓。在加强党内思想教育的同时，及时开展了大规模的打击经济犯罪的斗争，严肃处理了党员违法犯罪问题。根据反腐败斗争的需要，党中央、全国人大、国务院还在机构设置和立法方面采取了一系列措施，先后恢复、建立了纪检、监察、审计、检察机关，颁布了若干法律、法规，加强了党纪、政纪、法制建设。十三大明确提出了从严治党的方针，要求对败坏党和人民事业的腐败分子要坚决立即清除，决不能姑息养奸。从去年以来，党中央还在全国范围内推行了“两公开、一监督”和群众举报制度。十三届四中全会把坚决惩治腐败作为当前特别注意抓好的4件大事中的重要内容提到了全党的面前。最近，中央政治局又讨论并通过了《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》，各地党政机关也结合本地实际，提出了具体要求，并开始付诸行动。广大党员对腐败现象向来是深恶痛绝的，并进行了不懈的斗争。这些事实表明，我们党对反腐败是一贯重视的，真正反腐败的主导力量是我们党自己，而不是极少数搞资产阶级自由化、制造动乱的那些人。
    最近邓小平同志指出：在这次事件中，口号比较集中的是反腐败。当然，这个口号是他们的一个陪衬，其目的是用反腐败来蛊惑人心。但对我们来说，要整好我们的党，实现我们的战略目标，必须反对腐败。不惩治腐败，特别是党内的腐败，确实有失败的危险。我们要认清反腐败的意义，分清两种不同的反腐败，认真地扫除党内的腐败现象，使我们的党更加健康地发展。
      “多党制”与中国共产党领导下的多党合作制是根本不同的。它的实质是要在中国建立一个同共产党相对立的反对党，否定共产党的领导，这是违背中国历史发展规律和中国人民的利益的，是根本行不通的。
    顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人喋喋不休地说，中国共产党的领导是“一党专政”，是“民主政治”的障碍，唯一的出路就是像西方那样实行“多党政治”。这种观点的实质，是要在中国建立一个同共产党相对立的反对党，否定共产党的领导地位。这种观点是同中国革命发展的历史道路和中国人民的根本利益相违背的，是根本行不通的。
    西方的多党制，是一种什么样的政治制度？它的实质是什么？西方多党制是指在资产阶级统治的国家内，长期存在3个以上势均力敌的政党。为了维护自身的利益而采取几个政党联合执政，或轮流执政的政治制度。这种制度是资产阶级各派之间相互争夺又相互妥协的产物。表面上看，你上台，我下台，好像很民主，其实质则是资产阶级“一党”的统治，归根到底是为少数剥削者的利益服务的，对劳动人民只是一种欺骗。邓小平同志说：“资本主义国家的多党制有什么好处？那种多党制是资产阶级互相倾轧的竞争状态所决定的，他们谁也不代表广大劳动人民的利益。”（《邓小平文选》第231页）这是符合实际的。
    我们的国家是一个以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。全国人民的根本利益是一致的。为了实现自己的根本利益，需要有一个统一的领导力量和领导核心，把亿万人民的力量凝聚起来，这个领导力量和领导核心，只能是无产阶级的政党——中国共产党。历史已经证明，在中国，自五四运动以来的七十年中，除了中国共产党，根本不存在一个联系广大劳动群众的、全心全意为人民服务的、能够担负起领导中国革命和建设重任的政党。中国共产党在中国人民革命事业中的领导地位和作用，是中国各族人民的利益和意志所决定的，是历史所决定的。中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，而工人阶级没有自己狭隘的阶级利益，在工人阶级内部没有根本的利害冲突，因此也没有必要在工人阶级内部分裂成两个或几个对立的政党去轮流执政。中国共产党自成立以来，就是一个统一的整体，党内不允许拉山头搞宗派，更不允许把党分裂成两个或几个对立的政党。因此，在中国搞反对党，既无条件，也无需要。如果允许与共产党对立的反对党存在，就是允许破坏人民利益的政治势力存在，就会给国家造成动乱，给人民带来灾难，这是中国人民绝对不能允许的。
    我国也是一个多党派的国家。除了共产党以外，还有8个民主党派。各民主党派在民主革命中有光荣的历史，在社会主义改造中也作出了重要的贡献。现在，各民主党派就其基本成份讲，都已经成为各自所联系和代表的一部分社会主义劳动者和一部分拥护社会主义的爱国者的政治联盟，都是在共产党领导下为社会主义服务的政治力量。共产党把马克思主义关于建立革命统一战线的理论同中国的具体实践相结合，成功地解决了共产党与民主党派合作的问题，建立了共产党领导下的多党合作制度。这是我国政治制度的一个特点和优点，是由我国的具体历史条件和现实条件所决定的，也是包括各民主党派在内的广大人民群众的根本利益决定的。这种制度，有利于发挥民主党派在社会主义现代化建设中作用，有利于社会主义民主政治建设，有利于祖国的统一和“一国两制”构想的实现。
    共产党领导下的多党合作制与资本主义的多党制是根本不同的。共产党领导下的多党合作制，是社会主义民主的具体体现，代表了广大人民群众的根本利益；资本主义的多党制，是资本主义的政治制度，其实质是资产阶级的“一党”统治，代表了资产阶级的利益。我国的各民主党派是在接受共产党的领导的前提下，在四项基本原则的基础上，参加国家政权，共商国家大事。正如邓小平同志所说：“中国的其他党，是在承认共产党领导这个前提下面，服务于社会主义事业的。”（《邓小平文选》第281页）而不是资本主义国家中那种执政党和反对党的关系。共产党与民主党派之间，有共同的政治基础、共同的奋斗目标和共同的根本利益，因而能够长期共存、互相监督、肝胆相照、荣辱与共、真诚合作，而不像资产阶级政党那样互相争斗、互相拆台。因此，坚定不移地发展和完善共产党领导下的多党合作制，理直气壮地反对在中国企图实行“多党制”的一切言行，是我们的一项重要任务。
    要聚精会神地抓党的建设。坚持党的领导，必须改善党的领导，二者的关系是统一的。要把加强党的建设的工作作为长期的任务始终不懈地抓下去。
    早在32年前，邓小平同志就指出：“共产党有没有资格领导，这决定于我们自己。”历史已经充分证明，中国共产党是有资格领导中国的社会主义现代化事业的，对搞资产阶级自由化的人对党的种种诬蔑和攻击必须彻底批判。但是，也应当清醒地看到，在改革开放的新形势下，党内确实出现了许多新问题，有些问题还相当严重。这些问题不仅影响了党在群众中的威信，也影响了党的领导作用的发挥。之所以出现这些问题，一个很重要的原因，就是这几年赵紫阳同志放松了党的建设。针对这种情况，邓小平同志语重心长地提出，“要聚精会神地抓党的建设”，这是在总结了近几年党的建设的经验教训的基础上而得出的重要结论。
    党的建设必须紧密联系党的基本路线来进行。党的基本路线是党的建设的指路明灯，党的建设是实现党的基本路线的根本保证。要用党的基本路线统一全党的思想和行动。要加强坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，把被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想理论问题纠正过来。要按照党的基本路线的要求加强党的组织建设。当前要重点抓好对各级领导干部在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱中的思想认识和实际表现的考察。把那些能够坚决贯彻党的基本路线，特别是在这场斗争中表现突出的优秀干部，根据需要选拔到各级领导班子中，坚决清除党内的敌对分子、反党分子、腐败分子，纯洁党的组织，保证各级领导权牢牢地掌握在真正的马克思主义者手中。要用执行党的基本路线的实际效果来检验党的工作的好坏，努力把我们党建设成为能够以崭新的姿态站在改革和现代化建设前列的党，勇于改革、充满活力的党，纪律严明、公正廉洁的党，选贤任能、卓有成效地为人民服务的党。
    要把学习马克思主义基本理论作为党的思想建设的根本任务来抓。邓小平同志早就指出，党的各级干部，首先是领导干部在繁忙的工作中，要有一定时间学习马克思主义基本理论，从而加强我们工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性。但是，邓小平同志的这个指示并没有得到很好地贯彻落实。近些年来，党内出现的许多问题，都与忽视了对马克思主义基本理论的学习有关。根据前几年的实践，学习马克思主义基本理论仅有一般的号召还不行，还必须有切实可行的制度作保证。各级党组织要把学习马克思主义基本理论放在重要日程上，党委成员和党的领导干部要带头学习。要坚持理论联系实际的原则，改造客观世界也改造主观世界，牢固确立马克思主义的世界观，牢固树立共产主义远大理想。要有具体的学习计划，尽快编写出适合不同层次的人员的教材。同时还应把学习成绩的好坏和马克思主义理论水平的高低作为考核、使用干部的重要依据。要采取多种措施调动广大党员学习马克思主义的积极性，在全党形成一个学习马克思主义的浓厚空气。
    要把党风建设提高到一个新的水平。党风问题是关系到党的生死存亡的大问题。抓党风建设，当前要下大力气反对腐败。为了防止腐败就必须提倡艰苦奋斗的作风。邓小平同志指出：
  “艰苦奋斗是我们的传统，艰苦朴素教育今后要抓紧，一直抓60年到70年。我们的国家越发展，越要抓艰苦创业。提倡艰苦创业精神，也有助于克服腐败现象。建国以来我们一直在讲艰苦创业，后来日子稍微好一点，就提倡高消费，于是，各方面的浪费现象蔓延，加上思想政治工作薄弱，法制不健全，什么违法乱纪和腐败现象等等，都出来了。”我们要清醒地认识到：艰苦奋斗是无产阶级政党在建设和改革中抵制腐败的锐利武器，是无产阶级革命家在实践中的工作作风，也是每一个真正共产党员的生活方式。我们要从这样的高度来认识艰苦奋斗，自励自勉，身体力行，使我们党的党风有一个根本的转变。
    要加强党的制度建设，改革党和国家的领导制度。加强党的领导，改善党的领导，要在党的制度上作一些规定，改革党和国家的领导制度。党的制度建设主要是健全以民主集中制为基础的党内各项制度。要健全民主集中制，使党的集体领导制度化；健全党的代表大会制度，保障党员的民主权利；健全党的监督制度，加强党的制度建设。在新的历史条件下，要改革党和国家的领导体制，实行党政分开。实行党政分开，目的是为了加强党的政治领导。任何借口党政分开，削弱党的领导的做法都是错误的。
    聚精会神地抓党的建设，是坚持党的领导和改善党的领导的需要。坚持党的领导与改善党的领导是辩证统一的。只有坚持党的领导，才能谈得上改善党的领导。只有改善党的领导，才能真正坚持党的领导，加强党的领导。借口改善党的领导，淡化党的领导，否定党的领导是根本错误的。担心削弱党的领导，而放松改善党的领导，党的领导就会失去生命力。坚持党的领导是长期的，改善党的领导也是长期的。我们要正确处理好坚持与改善的关系，把党的建设作为一项长期的任务始终不懈地抓下去。
