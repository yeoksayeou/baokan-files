Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 19th.

To prevent the creation of a permanent occupation fact, the Japanese government urges citizens not to travel to the Northern Territories.

The Cabinet meeting yesterday adopted a resolution urging Japanese citizens not to travel to the Northern Territories, which are under Soviet occupation, to prevent the creation of a permanent occupation fact.

The resolution states that Japan's inherent Northern Territories are still illegally occupied by the Soviet Union. The government is conducting negotiations for the return of the Northern Territories in accordance with the will of the nation and relevant resolutions of the Diet. In this context, entering the Northern Territories based on Soviet entry and exit procedures, which are premised on the illegal occupation by the Soviet Union, is contrary to the will of the nation and the government's policy.

    为避免造成苏永久占领事实
　　日政府要国民勿前往北方领土
    新华社东京9月19日电　据时事社报道，日本政府内阁会议昨天通过一项决议，要求日本国民不要前往苏联占领的日本北方领土，以避免造成苏联永久占领北方领土的事实。
    决议指出，日本的固有北方领土现在依然被苏联非法占据着。政府正在根据国民的意愿和国会有关决议，为实现归还北方领土进行交涉。在这种情况下，以苏联非法占据为前提，根据苏联的出入境手续进入北方领土，是违背国民的意愿和政府的政策的。
