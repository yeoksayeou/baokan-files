China has entered the ranks of the world's major patent nations. Since the implementation of the Patent Law on April 1, 1985, the number of patent applications has been increasing year by year. By the first half of this year, the total number of patent applications received by the China Patent Office has exceeded 100,000, with an average annual increase of 33% over the past four and a half years.

To adapt to the needs of reform and opening up, a systematic national patent work system has been initially established. The State Council and relevant departments, as well as provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities with separate planning status, have set up 99 patent management agencies. There are now 435 patent agency organizations nationwide, with more than 4,800 patent agents.

With the further development of reform and opening up, the number of foreigners applying for patents in China has also been increasing year by year. So far, citizens from 59 countries and regions have applied for patents in China, with a cumulative application volume of 22,222.

Patent work has also become an important channel for China to go global. China has joined the _World Intellectual Property Organization Convention_ and the _Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property_. The China Patent Office provides 33,000 patent specifications and more than 2,300 patent gazettes to various parts of the world each year.

　　我国进入世界专利大国行列
    四年多来受理专利申请逾十万件
    新华社北京9月18日电　（记者杨兆波）我国已进入世界专利大国行列。自1985年4月1日实施专利法以来，专利申请量逐年上升，到今年上半年中国专利局受理的专利申请累计已经超过10万件，4年多来专利申请受理量以每年平均33％的速度递增。
    适应改革开放形势的需要，一个系统的全国专利工作体系已初步形成。国务院有关部门和各省、自治区、直辖市以及计划单列市设置了99个专利管理机关。全国已成立专利代理机构435家，配备专利代理人4800多名。
    随着改革开放的进一步发展，外国人来华申请专利的数量也逐年增长。目前已有59个国家和地区的公民来我国申请专利，累计申请量达到22222件。
    专利工作也日益成为我国走向世界的重要通道。中国已加入《世界知识产权组织公约》和《保护工业产权巴黎公约》；中国专利局每年向世界各地提供专利说明书3.3万件，提供专利公报2300多册。
