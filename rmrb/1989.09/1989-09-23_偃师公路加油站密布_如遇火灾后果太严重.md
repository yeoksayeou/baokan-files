In Yan Shi County of our province, there are over 40 collective and individual small gas stations, one after another. Just in the village of Ying Fang Kou, there are 7 gas stations in a row. Many of these gas stations store large quantities of diesel and gasoline, typically around 20 barrels each, with some storing as much as 50 barrels. Some have even installed oil tanks with a capacity of 7-8 tons. Most of these gas stations are located in busy market areas, with the front facing the highway and the back adjacent to shops and residences. Some are even next to agricultural markets and fabric markets. The equipment at these gas stations is very rudimentary, lacking any sunshade or cooling measures, and there are no fire-fighting materials. Most of the oil they sell is of poor quality, produced by local refineries, posing a significant fire hazard. Currently, there are still people constructing new gas stations in this area.

To ensure the smooth flow of highway transportation and the safety of pedestrians, we appeal to the relevant departments to take immediate action and regulate these gas stations.

    偃师公路加油站密布
    如遇火灾后果太严重
    在我省偃师县境内，一个连一个的集体、个体小加油站达40多个。仅营房口村就有7个加油站连在一起。不少加油站柴油、汽油的储存量大，一般都在20桶左右，多的达50多桶，有的还架上了七八吨的大油罐。这些加油站大多设在闹市区，前面紧靠公路，后面接连商店和住户，有的紧挨农贸、布匹市场。加油站设备十分简陋，既没有遮阳降温措施，也没有灭火器材，经营的大部分是一些土炼油厂炼制的劣质油，火灾危险性很大。目前，这一地段仍然还有一些人在兴建加油站。
    为了保证公路运输畅通和行人安全，呼吁有关部门立即采取措施，管管这些加油站。
