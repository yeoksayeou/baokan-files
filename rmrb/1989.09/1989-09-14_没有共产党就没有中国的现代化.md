Without the Communist Party, there would be no modernization of China
Lǐ Lún

A large population, low quality, scarce resources, and a weak foundation are the basic elements of our objective national conditions. These national conditions are a fundamental starting point for China's modernization.

Objective national conditions, as an objective existence, are easy to reach a consensus on. However, accepting these basic facts is one thing, and how to deal with these basic facts is another. The key is that our fundamental purpose in recognizing and acknowledging these objective national conditions is to transform and perfect them, not to curse them, avoid them, or ignore objective conditions and rush for quick results, attempting to achieve everything at once. Therefore, based on the recognition of objective national conditions, how to transform them into a correct understanding and a great force that can truly transform and perfect the objective national conditions is extremely important.

A complete "national conditions" concept should consist of both objective national conditions and subjective national conditions. A certain objective world constitutes certain objective national conditions, and a certain subjective world constitutes certain subjective national conditions. Moreover, the completion of social transformation mainly relies on the active role of the subjective world to fundamentally achieve it. Therefore, in the process of social transformation, the recognition of subjective national conditions often has a more important position and role than the recognition of objective national conditions.

Under what conditions can the consensus on objective national conditions be transformed into a truly active force that can transform and perfect the objective national conditions? This requires a consensus on subjective national conditions, that is, to establish a common belief among the people of the whole country, and by what social force to assume the core leadership role of the people of the whole country, so as to maximize the organization, cohesion, and coordination of dispersed group forces. In today's China, the social backbone force that can undertake the enormous organizational and coordinating functions in the extremely arduous and complex transformation of objective national conditions has been answered by history. It can only be the Communist Party of China. It is the Communists of China, with a serious and pragmatic attitude towards objective national conditions, who have led the Chinese people to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, established the People's Republic of China; basically formed an independent and relatively complete national economic system, developed socialist economy, politics, and culture; proposed the theory of the primary stage of socialism, formulated the basic line of "one center, two basic points" and the economic development strategy of the "three-step curve," making China's socialist modernization construction gain vigorous vitality and dynamism in the reform and opening up. There is comparison before there is distinction. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be nothing in modern China. The Chinese people not only need to regard "without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" as a consensus but also need to regard "without the Communist Party, there would be no modernization of China" as a consensus.

### 没有共产党就没有中国的现代化

　　没有共产党就没有中国的现代化
　　李伦
    人口多，素质差，资源少，底子薄，是我们客体国情中的基本内容。这些国情是我国现代化建设的一个基本出发点。
    客体国情作为一种客观存在物，容易形成共识。但是，接受这些基本事实是一回事，如何对待这些基本事实又是另一回事。问题在于，我们认识和承认这种客体国情的根本目的，是为了改造它、完美它；而不是诅咒它，逃避它，或者不顾客观条件的限制，一味从主观出发急于求成，企图毕其功于一役。所以，在认识客体国情的基础上，如何再转化为一种真正能切实地改造、完美客体国情的正确认识和巨大力量，是极其重要的。
    完整的“国情”概念，应该由客体国情和主体国情两方面的内容组成，一定的客体世界构成一定的客体国情，一定的主体世界构成一定的主体国情。而且，社会改造的完成，主要要依靠主体世界的能动作用才得以根本实现。因此，在社会改造的过程中，对主体国情的认识常常比对客体国情的认识具有更重要的地位和作用。
    对客体国情的共识，在什么样的条件下，才能转化为一种真正能切实地改造、完美客体国情的积极力量？这就必须对主体国情形成共识，即在全国人民中确立一种共同的信念，由什么样的社会力量来担当领导全国人民的核心力量，才能最大限度地组织、凝聚和协调分散的群体力量。在当今中国，能够在无比艰巨、无比复杂的客体国情改造中坚韧不拔地担负起庞大的组织、协调职能的社会中坚力量，历史已经作出回答，它只能是中国共产党。正是中国共产党人，抱着对客体国情的实事求是的认真态度，脚踏实地地、锲而不舍地领导中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立了中华人民共和国；基本上形成了独立的、比较完整的国民经济体系，发展了社会主义的经济、政治、文化；提出了社会主义初级阶段的理论，制定了“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线和经济发展战略的“三步曲”，使我国社会主义现代化建设在改革开放中获得了蓬勃的生机和活力。有比较才有鉴别。没有共产党的领导，就没有现代中国的一切，中国人民不仅需要把“没有共产党，就没有新中国”作为一种共识，而且还需要把“没有共产党，就没有中国的现代化”也作为一种共识。
