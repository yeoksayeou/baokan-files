At the southwestern end of China's mainland coastline, two modern ports are rising, known as the "Pearl of the Beibu Gulf" and the "Most Convenient Seaport for Southwest China"—Beihai Port and Fangcheng Port.

Today, the urban area of Beihai is bustling with high-rise buildings, hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, enterprises, and companies. This city of just 180,000 people has seen its total social output value, national income, and fiscal revenue increase by 4 times, 4.7 times, and 3.29 times respectively since it was designated as an open city in 1983. To meet the needs of further opening up, Beihai has invested nearly 200 million yuan in recent years to build a medium-sized airport capable of all-weather takeoffs and landings for medium-sized aircraft, as well as two 10,000-ton berths. Currently, Beihai Port's annual handling capacity has increased from the original 7 million tons to over 150 million tons. According to near-term plans, two more 10,000-ton berths and an oil terminal will be built here. Upon completion, Beihai Port's annual handling capacity will exceed 500 million tons. The construction of the second-class highway from Nanning to Beihai is in full swing, with completion expected next year. The cargo and passenger ships between Beihai and Haikou began sailing on March 20 this year. Beihai and Nanning are now connected by 1,860 channels of microwave communication equipment and 5,000 lines of programmable control telephones. A modern port city with sensitive information and convenient transportation is taking shape. Currently, Beihai has established trade relations with 87 countries and regions around the world.

Fifty-one nautical miles away from Beihai is Fangcheng Port, known as the "Crown Jewel of the Treasure Kingdom of Southwest China." The entire port is situated on a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides, making it a natural deep-water shelter. In 1986, Fangcheng Port completed the construction of 7 deep-water berths totaling 1.6 kilometers in length, capable of accommodating 10,000-ton to 50,000-ton ocean-going vessels. Currently, Fangcheng Port's annual handling capacity has reached 360 million tons, and with some additional facilities, it can reach 470 million tons. It has become one of the top 10 ports in China, ranking third in South China after Huangpu and Zhanjiang.

Departing from Beihai and Fangcheng to Southeast Asia and Western Europe is more than 100 nautical miles closer than departing from Guangzhou. These two ports can directly connect the southwestern region with China's eastern coastal areas, serving as the most convenient channel for the southwestern provinces to develop trade with Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Western Europe. Today, these two ports are opening their arms wide to provide better services for more brotherly provinces and regions to go global.

### 大西南最便利的出海口　北海、防城在崛起

　　大西南最便利的出海口
　　北海、防城在崛起
    在我国大陆海岸线的西南端，崛起两个现代化的港口，这就是被誉为“北部湾的明珠”、“大西南最便捷的出海口”的北海港和防城港。
    如今北海市区，高楼林立，宾馆、商场、酒楼、企业、公司鳞次栉比。这个只有18万人口的城市，社会总产值、国民收入、财政收入与列为开放城市前的1983年比，分别增长4倍、4.7倍和3.29倍。为适应进一步开放的需要，近几年来，北海市投资近2亿元，先后建成了一个可供全天候起降的中型飞机场和两个万吨级泊位。现在北海港口年吞吐量已从原来的70万吨增加到150多万吨；按近期计划，这里还将再建两个万吨级泊位码头和一个石油码头。建成后，北海港的年吞吐能力将达500万吨以上。南宁至北海二级公路建设正在紧锣密鼓之中，预计明年可通车；北海至海口的货客轮已经于今年3月20日开始往返驶航。北海市与南宁市之间已经架通1860路微波通讯设备及5000门程控电话。一个信息灵敏、交通便利的现代化港口城市正在日趋兴盛。目前，这里已与世界87个国家和地区建立了贸易往来关系。
    与北海市相距51海里是被誉为“大西南宝藏王国的皇冠明珠”的防城港，全港横卧在一个三面环水的半岛上，是一个天然的深水避风海港。1986年，防城港全面完工总长为1.6公里的7个万吨级深水泊位码头，可停靠1万吨至5万吨级的远洋货轮。目前，防城港年吞吐能力已达360万吨，稍加配套，即可达470万吨。它已跻身于我国10大港口之列，成为仅次于黄埔、湛江的华南第三大港。
    从北海、防城出发驶往东南亚以及西欧等国要比从广州出发近100多海里，两港还可以把西南地区同我国东部沿海直接联系起来，是我国西南各省对东南亚及中东、西欧诸国发展贸易最便捷的通道。如今，这两个港口正敞开巨大的胸怀，为更多的兄弟省区走向世界提供良好的服务。
