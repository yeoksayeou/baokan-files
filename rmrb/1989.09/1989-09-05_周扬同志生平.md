    The Life of Comrade Zhou Yang
    Comrade Zhou Yang, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a revolutionary of the proletariat, a renowned Marxist literary theorist, one of the pioneers of the proletarian revolutionary cultural movement, and an outstanding leader of the Party in the literary and artistic field, had long been ill and passed away in Beijing on July 31, 1989, at the age of 81.

    Comrade Zhou Yang, originally named Zhou Qi Ying, was born in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, in 1908. After the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the "April 12" counterrevolutionary coup in 1927, he joined the Communist Party of China in the face of white terror, beginning his revolutionary career. In 1928, Zhou Yang graduated from Shanghai's Daxia University and went to study in Japan that winter. After returning to Shanghai in 1930, he participated in leading the Chinese Left-Wing Revolutionary Literary Movement. In 1932, he rejoined the Party, serving as the Party Secretary of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League, the Secretary of the Cultural Affairs Committee of the Shanghai Central Bureau of the Communist Party, and the Secretary of the Cultural Alliance. He also edited the official publication of the Left-Wing Writers' League, "Literary Monthly." During this period, under the leadership of Comrades Lu Xun, Qu Qiubai, and Zhang Wentian, he broke through the Kuomintang's counterrevolutionary cultural "siege" and, under extremely difficult conditions, introduced Marxist literary theory to China. In 1933, he introduced the theory of Socialist Realism, which was being discussed and promoted in the Soviet literary circles, to China. Together with Lu Xun, Qu Qiubai, Feng Xuefeng, and others, he criticized the erroneous cultural thoughts of the bourgeoisie, expanded the influence of Marxist literary theory, and contributed to the development of the proletarian literary movement. On the eve of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, he and other comrades advocated the establishment of an anti-Japanese national united front in the literary and artistic circles, making active efforts to welcome the arrival of the national revolutionary war.

    After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Zhou Yang left Shanghai for Yan'an in 1937, serving as the Director of the Education Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Director of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and Literature, a member of the Central Cultural Committee, and the President of Yan'an University. After Japan's surrender in 1945, he led part of the Yan'an University staff to Jin-Cha-Ji, serving as the Vice President of the North China United University. During the War of Liberation, he successively served as the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Communist Party in Jin-Cha-Ji and the Director of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau. After Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art was published, he advocated the New Folk Song Movement, enthusiastically promoting and implementing Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts, and promoting a batch of literary and artistic works that were popular among workers, peasants, and soldiers. He made significant contributions to the construction of literature and art in the liberated areas and to the cultivation of revolutionary literary and artistic talents. The book "Marxism and Literature" he compiled played an important role in the construction of Marxist literary theory in China. In July 1949, after the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, he and Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and others organized and convened the First National Congress of Literary and Artistic Workers, where he delivered a report on the literary and artistic movement in the liberated areas and was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In September of the same year, he participated in the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a representative of the literary and artistic circles.

    In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Zhou Yang served as the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Deputy Director and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers' Association. In 1956, he participated in the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee. He was a representative of the First, Second, and Third National People's Congresses and a standing committee member of the Third and Fourth National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. For 17 years after the founding of the Republic, Comrade Zhou Yang was always in a leading position in the work of cultural arts and propaganda and ideological work, making contributions to the construction of socialist cultural arts and ideological and theoretical work in China.

    In the early 1960s, Jiang Qing's brutal interference and wanton destruction of the literary and artistic circles were resisted by Comrade Zhou Yang, who was hated by Jiang Qing. At the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution," Comrade Zhou Yang was immediately slandered and publicly criticized, and then thrown into prison for nine years. The Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique subjected him to long-term persecution, causing him severe physical and mental suffering. However, Comrade Zhou Yang remained steadfast in his communist beliefs, always believing in the Party and the people, and under harsh conditions, he persisted in studying Marxist works, enduring severe tests.

    After the Gang of Four was smashed, Comrade Zhou Yang's case was rectified, and he returned to work. He was a member of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party, serving as the Vice President and President of the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a member of the Academic Division, the First Vice Chairman of the State Council Degree Committee, the Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Vice Chairman and Advisor of the Chinese Writers' Association, the Deputy Director and Advisor of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party, a member of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party, and a standing committee member of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the new historical period of socialism, Comrade Zhou Yang firmly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, actively participated in the exposure and criticism of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique, enthusiastically advocated for the emancipation of the mind, and actively participated in the discussion on "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth." He paid great attention to the summary of historical experience, especially to the examination and criticism of the "leftist" trend, playing an important role in the rectification of wrongs and the restoration of the correct path in cultural arts and ideological and theoretical work. He insisted on the direction of serving the people and socialism and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, he presided over the convening of the Fourth National Congress of Literary and Artistic Workers, which was of great historical significance. In his keynote speech at the congress, he summarized the historical experience of literature and art over the past few decades and proposed the tasks of literature and art in the new period. At this congress, which carried on the past and opened up the future, he was elected as the Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Comrade Zhou Yang, as a representative, participated in the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party. He firmly supported the line and principles proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, supported the decision to build socialist material and spiritual civilization, and supported the cause of reform and opening up.

    Comrade Zhou Yang was loyal to the Party and the people. He had a broad mind, considered the overall situation, was approachable, and good at uniting with comrades. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party, in summarizing historical experience, he was strict with himself and often criticized himself for mistakes made in his work from the 1930s to later years. For comrades who were unjustly criticized and treated because of his work, he repeatedly expressed his sincere apologies. His magnanimity and demeanor won the respect of the people.

    Comrade Zhou Yang dedicated his life to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people and the revolutionary cultural cause. He worked hard to introduce Marxist literary theory, enthusiastically promoted and implemented Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts, and actively advocated the construction of a Marxist literary theory system with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Zhou Yang loved the Party and socialism and served the people wholeheartedly. He was a loyal communist cultural warrior. His contributions and spirit are forever worthy of our learning. His brilliant achievements are forever engraved in the annals of the Chinese people's revolution and Chinese cultural cause.

    Let us carry on his unfinished work, guided by the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization and various erroneous trends. Let us strive to strengthen propaganda and ideological work, further flourish and develop socialist culture.

    中国共产党的优秀党员、无产阶级革命家、著名的马克思主义文艺理论家、无产阶级革命文化运动的先驱者之一和党在文艺战线的卓越领导人周扬同志，长期卧病，久治无效，于1989年7月31日在北京逝世，终年81岁。
    周扬同志原名周起应，1908年生于湖南省益阳县。1927年国民党反动派发动“4·12”反革命政变后，他在白色恐怖的日子里，毅然参加中国共产党，开始了他的革命战斗生涯。周扬同志1928年毕业于上海大夏大学，同年冬留学日本。1930年回到上海后，参加领导中国左翼革命文艺运动。1932年重新入党，担任中共中国左翼作家联盟党团书记、中共上海中央局文委书记，兼任文化总同盟书记，主编左联机关刊物《文学月报》。在此期间，他在鲁迅、瞿秋白、张闻天等同志的领导下，冲破国民党反动派的反革命文化“围剿”，在极其艰难的条件下，向我国文艺界介绍马克思主义文艺理论。他在1933年，将苏联文艺界正在讨论、提倡的社会主义现实主义理论介绍到中国。他和鲁迅、瞿秋白、冯雪峰等人对资产阶级错误的文化思想进行了必要的批判，扩大了马克思主义文艺理论的影响，为无产阶级文艺运动的发展作出了贡献。抗日战争爆发前夕，他在党中央的领导下，根据革命形势的发展，与其他同志一起倡导建立文艺界抗日民族统一战线，为迎接民族革命战争的到来，作了积极的努力。
    抗日战争爆发后，周扬同志于1937年离上海赴延安，历任陕甘宁边区教育厅长、鲁迅艺术文学院院长、中央文委委员、延安大学校长。1945年日本投降后，他率领延安大学部分人员到晋察冀，出任华北联合大学副校长。解放战争期间，先后任中共晋察冀中央局宣传部长、华北局宣传部长。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表后，他倡导新秧歌运动，热情地宣传和贯彻毛泽东同志的文艺思想，推动了一批为工农兵所喜闻乐见的文艺创作问世。他在解放区的文艺建设和培育革命文艺人才方面作出了很大的贡献。他编选的《马克思主义与文艺》一书，对我国马克思主义文艺理论的建设，起了重要的作用。1949年7月，平津解放后，他与郭沫若、茅盾等负责筹备和召开了全国文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会，他在会上作了介绍解放区文艺运动的报告，当选为中国文联副主席。同年9月他作为文艺界的代表，参加了第一届中国人民政治协商会议。
    中华人民共和国成立初期，周扬同志任中共中央宣传部副部长、文化部副部长和党组书记、中国文联副主席、中国作家协会副主席。1956年参加中国共产党第八次代表大会，被选为中央候补委员。他是第一、二、三届全国人民代表大会代表及第三、四届全国政协常委。共和国成立后的17年，周扬同志一直处于文化艺术和宣传思想工作的领导岗位，为我国社会主义文化艺术事业和思想理论工作的建设作出了贡献。
    60年代初，江青对文艺界粗暴干预和肆意摧残，周扬同志进行了抵制，受到江青的忌恨。“文化大革命”一开始，周扬同志即遭诬陷并被公开点名批判，随即被投入监狱，长达9年之久。林彪、江青反革命集团对他进行长时间的迫害，使他身心倍受摧残。然而，周扬同志仍然坚贞不渝地坚持共产主义的信念，始终相信党、相信人民，在艰苦的条件下，坚持学习马克思主义著作，经受了严酷的考验。
    粉碎“四人帮”后，周扬同志的错案得到平反昭雪，重新走上工作岗位。他是中共第十一届中央委员，先后担任过中国社会科学院副院长兼研究生院院长、学部委员，国务院学位委员会第一副主任，中国文学艺术界联合会副主席、主席、党组书记、名誉委员，中国作家协会副主席、顾问，中共中央宣传部副部长、顾问以及中共中央纪律检查委员会常务委员、中共中央顾问委员会委员、第五届全国政协常务委员等职。在社会主义历史新时期，周扬同志坚决拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，积极参加了对林彪、江青反革命集团的揭发批判，热情倡导思想解放，积极参加了实践是检验真理的唯一标准的讨论。他十分重视对历史经验的总结，特别注意对“左”的思潮的检查和批判，在文化艺术和思想理论工作的拨乱反正、正本清源中发挥了重要作用。他坚持文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。在党中央领导下，他主持召开了具有重要历史意义的全国文学艺术工作者第四次代表大会。
    他在会上所作的主旨报告，总结了几十年来文艺的历史经验，提出了新时期文艺的任务。在这次继往开来的文代会上，他当选为中国文联主席。周扬同志作为代表参加了党的第十二次代表大会。他坚决拥护党中央提出的建设具有中国特色的社会主义的路线、方针，拥护建设社会主义物质文明与精神文明的决策，拥护改革开放的各项事业。
    周扬同志对党、对人民是忠诚的，他胸怀广阔，顾全大局，平易近人，善于团结同志。党的十一届三中全会以后，他在总结历史经验中，严于律己，经常对自己从30年代以至后来在工作上的某些失误进行自我批评。对于同他的工作有关而遭受不公正批评和对待的同志，一再诚恳地表示歉意。他的这种襟怀和气度，赢得了人们的敬重。
    周扬同志把自己的一生献给了中国人民解放事业和革命文化事业。他努力介绍马克思主义文艺理论，努力宣传和贯彻毛泽东文艺思想，积极倡导建设具有中国特色的马克思主义文艺理论体系。周扬同志热爱党、热爱社会主义，全心全意为人民服务，是一位忠诚的共产主义文化战士。他的贡献，他的精神，永远值得我们学习。他的光辉业绩，永远镌刻在中国人民革命和中国文化事业的史册。
