At 11:40 AM today, more than 100 labor models from Zhejiang Province just stepped off the train. Central Committee Politburo member and Vice Premier of the State Council Tian Jiyun and other leading comrades, who had been waiting on the platform at Beijing Railway Station, immediately went to greet them, saying, "Welcome!"

Tian Jiyun shook hands with the labor models while inquiring about their journey. Behind them, a red and white banner read: "The capital's people warmly welcome the national labor models! The capital's working class learns from and pays tribute to the labor models!"

After seeing off the labor models from Zhejiang Province, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun continued to wait on the platform for the arrival of the labor models from Heilongjiang Province. Members of the National Labor Model Commendation Conference Preparatory Committee took the opportunity to report to him on the conference schedule and other preparatory work. Tian Jiyun said: "This is a genuine gathering of heroes, and we must hold it well and treat the labor models well." He fully affirmed the principle of simplicity and earnestness followed by the conference.

At 11:55 AM, the labor models from Heilongjiang Province arrived, and Tian Jiyun and other leading comrades went to greet them again...

It is reported that this is the first time that party and state leaders have gone to the station to welcome labor models. Today, the responsible comrades who went to the railway station to welcome the labor models also included He Kang, An Chengxin, Zhang Fuyou, Wang Lianzhen, and others.

    中央领导人到车站迎接全国劳动模范
    据新华社北京9月26日电  （记者邵建武、王满）今天上午11时40分，浙江省的100多位劳动模范刚刚走下火车，早就等候在北京火车站月台上的中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云等领导同志便迎上去说：“欢迎你们！”
    田纪云一边和劳模们握手，一边关切地询问他们的旅途生活。在他们的身后，是白底红字的横幅标语：首都人民热烈欢迎全国劳模！首都工人阶级向劳模学习、致敬！
    送走浙江省的劳模，田纪云副总理又在月台上等候着黑龙江省劳模的到来。全国劳模表彰大会筹委会的同志插空向他汇报了会议的日程和其它准备工作。田纪云说：这是一次真正的群英大会，一定要开好，一定要招待好劳模。对大会遵循朴素认真的原则，田纪云给予了充分肯定。
    11时55分，黑龙江省的劳模来了，田纪云等领导同志又迎了上去……据介绍，党和国家领导人到车站迎接劳动模范，这是第一次。今天到火车站迎接劳模的负责同志还有何康、安成信、张富有、王连铮等。
