The manager of the Shiyou Company in Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, Ma Sivwa, announced on April 16 this year: "From today onwards, oil and coal quotas will be made public, and supervision is welcome." He also said, "No unit or individual can give me or my business personnel money or gifts in any form. If anyone insists on giving gifts, our company will exhibit them in the 'gift display room' and disclose their names to the public."

Ma Sivwa's move immediately caused a sensation in the local area. Some people said he was "showing off," while others said he had "made enough money and was now seeking political capital." However, the majority of people admired his actions and supported him in various ways. More than 20 news organizations across the country reported on Ma Sivwa's clean governance actions. A wave of learning from Ma Sivwa swept through the Yuncheng region.

More than five months have passed, and Ma Sivwa's actions are still a frequent topic of discussion among the local people. The reporter recently conducted interviews in Ruicheng County and deeply felt this.

At the county committee's guesthouse, Vice Secretary Wu of the county committee said his first words: "Old Ma's move has greatly promoted our work! In the past, people would always say, 'Write a note to get some oil or coal,' but now they don't come anymore. If they do come, I say, 'Look, Old Ma issued an announcement. Can I write a note? Do you want him to expose me?' We've avoided a lot of trouble."

"In the construction of clean governance, Ma Sivwa has emerged as a significant figure, promoting the work of Ruicheng County. However, having just one Ma Sivwa is far from enough." In a discussion meeting, people's talk about clean governance quickly went beyond the scope of Ruicheng County. Zhang Huai Liang from the county's disciplinary committee said, "The key issue is not how high we build up Ma Sivwa, but how many flowers and fruits this model has produced. We need to create a group of models. One tree cannot block the wind, but a forest can."

A young man from the county's organization department, surnamed Wang, spoke thoughtfully: "I think from Ma Sivwa's clean announcement, we should extend the discussion to the construction of a clean governance mechanism. We need a sound system." He believes, "Even with a system, we need a strong supervisory force."

"Clean governance is key to controlling those in real power." Individual businessman Wang Yihe said, "No one wants to give gifts, but they are afraid of being known and afraid of not being accepted. Yet some things cannot be done without gifts. Manager Ma is different. I am in the business of bulldozers, and when I went to buy oil, I was not at ease, as we did not know each other. However, as long as the procedures are in order, he would promptly approve it."

In the bustling crowd buying coal in front of the Shiyou Company, I asked an old woman sitting on a tractor, "Can you buy coal?" "Yes! They have issued books, it's just a matter of queuing early or late." "Do you know Ma Sivwa?" "I know, he issued an announcement, it's good for the farmers!"

When I met Ma Sivwa, he had just returned from accompanying an inspection team. This 43-year-old man with a dark face, tall and strong, clearly exuded a straightforward demeanor. He spoke calmly: "Initially, the announcement was made because some people used the pretext of giving me gifts to gain benefits, and I was not satisfied with taking the blame; secondly, many people cursed officials and those in power, and I did not like it; thirdly, dealing with gift-givers took a lot of energy, it was forced out of me."

When talking about the difficulties he encountered, he only briefly mentioned an incident where his oil tanker was blocked because he did not give gifts. As he bid me farewell, he said, "The Fourth Plenum has been held, and the central authorities have also taken action. I believe the overall atmosphere can be formed, as long as everyone acts sincerely. We cannot delay any longer." He said, "This path must be followed through, there is no turning back!"

When I left Ruicheng County, the county officials told me that there used to be a plaque at the entrance of the old county government building, which read, "You receive your salary, the people's fat and blood. It is easy to oppress the people, but it is difficult to deceive heaven." They were quite moved. Heaven, this was the sigh of helplessness of the people in feudal society regarding clean governance.

Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after 40 years of education in New China, the people are the masters of the country. The party and the people are united, and the officials and the masses are of one heart. This is the source of our strength in building clean governance.

### 马思娃“公告”引出的话题

    马思娃“公告”引出的话题
    本报记者　阎晓明
    山西省芮城县石油公司经理马思娃今年4月16日说：“从今天起，石油、煤炭指标一律公开，欢迎监督。”他还说：“任何单位、个人不能以任何方式给我和业务人员送钱送物，谁要硬送东西，本公司将在‘礼品陈列室’公开展览，向群众披露姓名。”
    马思娃这一招立即在当地引起轰动。有人说他“出风头”，有人说他是“油水捞饱了，又捞政治资本。”但是，绝大多数人对他的举动表示钦佩，用各种形式予以支持。全国20多家新闻单位报道了马思娃的廉政举动。运城地区曾经卷起一股学习马思娃的热浪。
    5个多月过去，马思娃的举动在当地依然是人们常常谈及的话题。记者日前在芮城县采访，深深感受到这一点。
    在县委招待所，县委吴副书记第一句话就说：“老马这一招对我们的工作促进可大啦！过去，总有人说，给写个条批点油吧，批些煤吧，现在不来了。来找，我就说，‘你看老马发了个公告，我写条能行？你是想让他给我公布？’我们少了好些麻烦。”
    “在廉政建设中，杀出一个马思娃，对芮城县的整个工作是个促进，但是，只有一个马思娃是远远不够的。”在一个座谈会上，人们关于廉政的话题一下就跃出了芮城的范围。县纪委的张怀亮说：“关键问题不是把马思娃树得多么高，而是要看这个典型开了多少花，结了多少果，要形成一个典型群。一棵树挡不了风，一片林子才能挡住风。”县委组织部一位姓王的年轻人一字一句地谈了他的思索：“我觉得从马思娃的廉洁公告应该引申到廉政机制建设上，要有健全的制度。”他认为，“有了制度还要有强大的监督力量。”
    “廉政关键是要抓那些掌实权的人。”个体户王义和说：“谁也不想送礼，又怕人知道，又怕人不要活受罪。可是有些事不送礼还办不成。马经理就不是这样。我是搞推土机的，找他买油，心里不踏实，咱不认识人家。结果，只要合手续，痛痛快快就批了。”
    在石油公司门前熙熙攘攘的买煤队伍里，我问一个坐在拖拉机上的老婆婆，“煤能买上吗？”“能！都发了本啦，就是排队早晚。”“你知道马思娃吗？”“知道，发了公告啦，对农民可好了！”
    我见到马思娃时，他刚陪一个检查团回来。这位43岁的黑脸汉子，身高体壮，一看就是豪爽之士。他谈得很平静：当初发公告，一是因为有人打着给我送礼的旗号捞好处，我不满这黑锅；二是好多人把当官的和掌实权的骂得狗血喷头，我不爱听；三是打发送礼的要费好多精力，是给逼出来的。
    谈到他所遇到的困难，他只淡淡地讲了一件因为不送礼自己的拉油车被卡的事。在与我告别时，他说：“四中全会开过了，中央也动了，我相信大气候能形成，就是要大家都动真的。再不能拖了。”他说：“他这条路非走到底不行，没有退路！”
    当我离开芮城县，县里的同志告诉我，旧县府的大街门口，曾立有一块匾，上书“尔奉尔禄，民脂民膏。下民易虐，上苍难欺。”他们挺感慨。上苍，这是封建社会人们对廉政无可奈何的唉叹。
    如今，在中国共产党领导下，经过40年新中国教育的人民大众，他们是国家的主人，党群一致，干群一心，这是我们廉政建设的力量所在。
