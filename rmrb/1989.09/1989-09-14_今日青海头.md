The place described in the ancient poem "君不见青海头，古来白骨无人收" is the shore of Qinghai Lake, the largest inland brackish water lake in China. Since the founding of New China, such a tragic scene has disappeared forever. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reform has given the grasslands wings to soar. Let's take a look at the historic changes in the production and living conditions of herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Haiyan County on the northern shore of Qinghai Lake:

Clothing
In the past, herdsmen wore fur coats during the day and used them as blankets at night. Now, they wear fashionable clothes in their daily lives, wear down jackets in winter, and use felt blankets and bedding.

Food
On the herdsmen's dining tables, flatbread, fried dough sticks, twisted dough, bread, steamed buns, noodles, dumplings, and various stir-fried dishes frequently appear, no longer just a bowl of fried noodles and a plate of "hand-torn mutton."

Housing
For thousands of years, herdsmen have followed the water and grass for their livelihood, living in felt tents and sleeping on "grass mattresses." Now, they build houses and settle in winter and spring pastures. Some herdsmen have access to running water and electricity, and some even have "stoves" installed in their houses.

Transportation
The situation of cattle carrying, horse riding, and herding is changing. Many herdsmen have bicycles, horse-drawn carts, cars, tractors, and some even ride motorcycles to herd cattle and sheep.

Utilities
"Using a washing machine to churn butter" is a new thing on the grasslands. After settling down, herdsmen have purchased sofas, wardrobes, ovens, record players, sewing machines, and other items. In the settled areas with electricity, at night, color televisions broadcast images and information from Beijing.

　　今日青海头
    “君不见青海头，古来白骨无人收。”这句古诗描述的地点，就是全国第一大内陆微咸水湖——青海湖岸畔的草原。新中国成立后，这种惨景已一去不复返。党的十一届三中全会以来，改革给草原插上了奋飞的金翅。请看青海湖北岸海晏县牧区牧民生产和生活中发生的历史性巨变：
　　衣
    过去，白天穿皮袄，夜晚盖皮袄。如今，平时身着漂亮的时装，冬天穿鸭绒服，盖的也换上毡毯被褥。
　　食
    在牧民的餐桌上，大饼、油条、麻花、面包、花卷、面片、饺子、各式炒菜经常出现，不再光是一碗炒面、一盘“手抓羊肉”了。
　　住
    千百年来，牧民“逐水草而居”，住毡房、帐篷，睡“草皮床”。现在，在冬春草场建房定居，部分牧民用上了自来水和电，有的还在屋内装上了“土暖气”。
　　行
    牛驮马载、乘骑放牧的状况正在改变。许多牧民有了自行车、马车、汽车、拖拉机，有的还骑着摩托放牧牛羊。
　　用
    “洗衣机打酥油”，这可是草原上的新鲜事。定居后，牧民购置了沙发、组合柜、烤箱、收录机、缝纫机等。在用上电的定居点，入夜，彩色电视机播送着来自北京的图象和信息。
