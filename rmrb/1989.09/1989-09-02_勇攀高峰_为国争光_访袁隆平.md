On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the author visited the Hunan Provincial Hybrid Rice Research Base at Anjiang Agricultural School. The visit was with Yuan Longping, who is climbing the peak of world agricultural science and technology and is internationally renowned as the "Father of Hybrid Rice." That day, he and his colleagues were evaluating a batch of new hybrid rice combinations.

The first step in hybrid rice research, achieving the three-line system for indica hybrid rice, has been successfully completed. From 1976 to 1988, Hunan Province cumulatively planted 230 million mu (approximately 15.33 million hectares) of hybrid rice, increasing rice production by 11.5 billion kilograms. In just the past two years, nearly 400 million mu (approximately 26.67 million hectares) have been planted nationwide, resulting in an increase of approximately 34 billion kilograms of grain. It has also bloomed and borne fruit in countries such as the Philippines and the United States.

"The second step, the two-line system for hybrid rice between indica and japonica varieties, is currently underway. We have already developed the 'Anjiang S-1 photoperiod-sensitive sterile line,'" said Professor Yuan Longping.

"Have you heard that Comrade Deng Xiaoping highly evaluates this research achievement?"

"Yes. The 'Anjiang S-1 photoperiod-sensitive sterile line' has many advantages. It can save seed production area, reduce seed production procedures, improve economic benefits, and increase yield by about 20% compared to three-line system varieties. Moreover, the quality of the rice has also significantly improved."

"And what about the third step?"

"This third step is the one-line system for distant hybrid rice. These three steps will make hybrid rice develop in the direction of simplifying procedures, increasing yield, and improving quality."

I asked, "What are your suggestions for current agricultural production?" He believes that excellent varieties are undoubtedly very important for increasing grain production, but good cultivation systems and cultivation methods are also needed. Currently, there is a severe shortage of technical personnel at the grassroots level, and training needs to be organized vigorously. In addition, water conservancy conditions need to be further improved, and the production and supply of fertilizers and pesticides also need to catch up.

Yuan Longping is tirelessly exploring and continuing to climb new heights.

### 勇攀高峰  为国争光——访袁隆平

    勇攀高峰  为国争光
    ——访袁隆平
    国庆四十周年前夕，笔者在湖南省杂交水稻研究基地——安江农校，访问了攀登世界农业科技高峰、被国际上誉为“杂交水稻之父”的袁隆平教授。那天，他和同事们正在鉴定一批新的杂交水稻组合。
    杂交水稻研究的第一步，即实现籼型杂交水稻的三系配套，现已圆满完成。从一九七六年到一九八八年，湖南省累计种植杂交水稻面积达二点三亿亩，增产稻谷一百一十五亿公斤。仅近两年，全国种植了近四亿亩，约增产三百四十亿公斤粮食。它还在菲律宾、美国等十几个国家开花结果。
      “第二步，即籼粳亚种间两系法杂交水稻的研究，现在正在走，已育成‘安农S—1光敏不育系’。”袁隆平教授说。
      “听说小平同志对这项科研成果评价很高。”
      “是的。‘安农S—1光敏不育系’具有很多优势。它既能节省繁种面积，减少制种程序，提高经济效益，产量又可比三系法品种增产百分之二十左右。而且米质也有很大提高。”
      “那么，第三步呢？”
      “这第三步嘛，就是一系法远缘杂交。以上这三步棋，使杂交稻朝着程序上由繁到简，效率上产量越来越高，质量上越来越好的方向发展。”
    我问：“你对当前农业生产有何建议？”他认为，优良品种对增产粮食无疑非常重要，但还需有好的耕作制度和好的栽培方法的配合，目前基层技术干部极缺，需要大力组织培训。此外，水利条件要进一步改善，化肥、农药的生产供应工作也得赶上。
    袁隆平孜孜不倦地探索着，继续向新的高峰攀登。（罗建）
