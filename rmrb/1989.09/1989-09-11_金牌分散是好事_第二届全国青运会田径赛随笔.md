At the Shenyang City Central Stadium, during the second National Youth Games track and field events, two phenomena that were previously rare occurred. First, the traditional track and field powerhouses did not monopolize the podium, replaced instead by athletes from various provinces and cities taking turns to stand on the podium. Second, in the sprint races, runners finished in a tight pack, making it difficult to distinguish the winners. This sparked a lot of discussion, with the general consensus being that the future of track and field looks promising, with a new generation of athletes emerging. This indicates that everyone is focusing on track and field and building a strong foundation.

Internationally, football is often referred to as the father of sports, while track and field is considered the mother. Once, a foreign guest asked a deputy director of the State Sports Commission which was more important, football or track and field. The deputy director, with a sense of humor, replied, "As a woman, I naturally think the mother is more important, so track and field is more important." Her words reflect our new understanding of track and field, with various provinces and cities beginning to pay more attention to it. Many provinces have shown good results and discovered talented athletes in the track and field events of the National Youth Games. For example, in the women's junior javelin throw, Ha Xiaoyan from Shaanxi took first place, in the women's junior high jump, Guan Shumin from Inner Mongolia emerged victorious, in the men's junior pole vault, Ying Hui from Anhui won the gold medal, and in the women's senior discus throw, Qiu Qiaoping from Sichuan topped the list with a throw of 59.82 meters.

In the stands, former track and field powerhouses are feeling the heat and can no longer sit still. Provinces and cities like Guangdong and Shanghai, which have a strong track and field foundation, used to easily win gold, silver, and bronze medals. Now, if they don't fight hard, they will find it difficult to achieve their leading positions. This competitive atmosphere, with everyone pushing each other to improve, is driving the traditional powerhouses to reach new heights.

Liu Yunkun, a track and field expert from Liaoning, told reporters at the venue, "We should use the Olympic Games as a benchmark to select our athletes." Coaches from Sichuan and other regions nearby expressed their agreement. Today, as they have taken gold medals from the traditional powerhouses, tomorrow they will surely aim for Olympic standards.

　　金牌分散是好事
　  ——第二届全国青运会田径赛随笔
    在沈阳市中心体育场举行的二青会田径赛上，出现了两个过去极为少见的现象。一，不见田径大户在领奖台上唱独角戏，取而代之的是各省市选手轮流登领奖台；二是短跑赛齐头并进，一齐冲线，难分先后。对此，引起一番议论，普遍的看法是，田径势头看好，后继有人，这说明大家都在抓田径，打基础。
    国外，把足球比作运动之父，把田径比作运动之母。有一次，一位外宾问国家体委一位副主任，足球和田径那个重要。这位副主任风趣地说，我作为一名妇女，当然认为母亲重要，所以田径更为重要。她的话，说明了我们对田径运动有了新的认识，各省市开始重视田径。很多省在青运会田径赛场上都出现好成绩，涌现出好苗子。如女子标枪乙组，陕西的哈晓燕获第一，女子乙组跳高，内蒙古的管淑敏夺魁，男子乙组撑杆跳，安徽的应辉获金牌，女子甲组铁饼，四川妹子邱巧萍以59.82米名列榜首。
    在看台上，昔日的田径大户已经感到火烧眉毛，坐不住了。像广东、上海等田径基础好的省市，过去夺“金”取“银”拿“铜”都是常事，现在如不死拚就难以实现领先的计划。这种东西南北中竞争之势，形成你追我赶之潮，迫使田径大户更上一层楼。
    辽宁田径行家刘云昆在赛场对记者说，选苗子要用奥运会这把尺子去衡量。他身边的四川等地教练表示赞同。今天他们既然从田径大户手中分得金牌，明天必然会朝着奥运会的水平前进。
