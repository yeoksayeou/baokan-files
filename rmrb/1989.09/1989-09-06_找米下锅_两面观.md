The saying "A skilled woman cannot cook without rice" is often used to describe the predicament of some enterprises that are struggling to obtain the necessary energy and raw materials for production. This is a problem currently faced by many industrial enterprises.

To address the issue of "no rice to cook," many enterprises have adopted the strategy of "finding rice to cook." These "skilled women" are using every means possible to secure raw materials through various channels, ensuring the continuation of enterprise production.

From "no rice" to "finding rice," it can be said that this reflects the proactive role of enterprise managers, especially in the context of a commodity economy and market competition. However, due to the numerous enterprises all seeking to "find rice" in the market, and because some units are taking advantage of the situation to "raise prices and buy up supplies," this has led to a series of "battles," also placing an unbearable burden on enterprises. Practice has led people to question: Can relying on "finding rice to cook" fundamentally solve the problem of raw material shortages in enterprises?

Generally speaking, "finding rice to cook" is usually done when one does not control the "rice" resources. Finding rice inevitably involves a degree of randomness. Today, you might "find" some, but there is no guarantee that you can "find" it tomorrow. This "eat one meal, worry about the next" situation, not to mention how long it can sustain production? Due to some enterprises' "desperate for food," the "rice" they find is bound to be mixed and of poor quality, and it is not guaranteed to meet quality standards. This is one aspect. Secondly, the reason enterprises are "without rice" lies in the imbalance between the supply of raw materials and energy in the market and the overall development of the processing industry. If the "rice" is scarce and the "pots" are many, and if the fundamental problem is not solved, while continuing to encourage processing enterprises that are not in line with raw material supply to "find rice to cook," it will only further exacerbate the supply-demand contradiction, even affecting the normal production of key state enterprises.

From this perspective, the behavior of "finding rice to cook" should be analyzed specifically. If you have surplus raw materials and I urgently need them, "finding rice to cook" can fully utilize resources. If everyone is short of raw materials, finding more will only exacerbate the supply-demand contradiction. The fundamental solution is to quickly adjust the current imbalance between the processing industry and the basic industry, and resolutely eliminate those pots that waste electricity and raw materials. Of course, saying "eliminate pots" is not to advocate simply closing down some enterprises or cutting certain projects. Instead, it is to transfer the funds, equipment, labor, and other resources used to maintain these enterprises and projects to the development of other industries, especially the development of basic industries such as energy and raw materials, striving to ensure the stability and development of the entire economy, and avoiding unnecessary "slippages." Some places, after experiencing "painful sacrifices" of self-compression and self-adjustment, have timely formulated a policy of developing energy and raw material-type township enterprises, turning many enterprises from competing with large enterprises for "food" to providing "grain" for large enterprises, and forming a stable industrial development pattern. This shows that as long as we start from reality and formulate corresponding adjustment policies and measures, the "skilled woman cannot cook without rice" situation faced by some local processing enterprises will fundamentally change.

### “找米下锅”两面观

    “找米下锅”两面观
    许伯贤
    “巧妇难为无米之炊”。人们常常把生活中的这个朴素道理引伸到经济工作中来，以此来形容一些企业为生产所需能源、原材料供给不上而犯愁的情状。这也是目前一些工业企业所面临的问题。
    如何解决“无米之炊”的困难，不少企业采取“找米下锅”的对策，“巧妇”们想方设法，各显神通，通过多种途径组织原材料，维持企业生产。
    从“无米”到“找米”，应该说，体现了企业经营者的一种主观能动作用，尤其是在商品经济客观存在和允许市场竞争的条件下，显然是必要的。但是，由于众多的企业纷纷到市场上去“找米”，由于一些单位乘机“抬价抢购”等原因，导致了一场场“大战”，也给企业增加了不堪承受的负担。实践使人们不得不产生这样的疑问：靠“找米下锅”能从根本上解决企业原材料短缺的难题吗？
    一般来看，“找米下锅”通常是在不掌握“米”资源情况下进行的。找，势必带有一定的盲目性，今天你或许
  “找”来了一些，却难保明天还能“找”得来，这种“吃一顿愁一顿”的状况，且不说能维持生产多久？由于一些企业
  “饥不择食”，找来的“米”难免杂和差，也未必能保证质量。此其一。其二，企业所以“无米”，根源在于市场原料和能源供给与整个加工工业发展不相平衡，“米”少“锅”多，如果不从根本上解决这个问题，而继续鼓励那些与原料供给不相适应的加工企业去“找米下锅”，只会进一步加剧供求矛盾，直至影响国家重点企业正常生产。
    由此看来，对“找米下锅”行为要作具体分析，你那里原材料有剩余，我这里又急需，“找米下锅”就能充分利用资源。大家都缺的原材料，找的多了，只能加剧供需矛盾。根本的办法是要尽快调整目前那种加工工业与基础工业不相协调的产业结构，下决心把那些浪费电力和原材料的锅端掉。当然，说“端锅”，决不是提倡简单地把一些企业关掉、把某些项目砍掉完事，而是把用于维持这些企业和项目的资金、设备、劳动力等，转移到其它产业的发展上去，特别是能源和原材料等基础工业的发展上去，努力保证整个经济的稳定和发展，避免出现不必要的“滑坡”。有的地方在经历了“忍痛割爱”的自我压缩、自我调整之后，及时制定了以发展能源、原材料型乡镇企业为主的方针，使许多企业从过去与大企业争“饭”吃转到为大企业提供“粮食”，自身也形成了一个稳定发展的工业新格局。这说明只要从实际出发，制定相应的调整方针和措施，一些地方加工企业存在的“巧妇难为无米之炊”的状况，就会得到根本性的改观。
