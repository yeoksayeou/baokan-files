I allowed Director Zhang Liang to guide me from the bustling "Yamaha Fish Market" to the bustling and luxurious "Women's Street."

Here, gold and silver jewelry, belts, handbags, bras, underwear, fashion shoes, and hats—all kinds of women's products are displayed in abundance; the store decorations, window displays, and billboard arrangements are colorful, vying for attention, each with its own unique charm. The young and beautiful female entrepreneurs are the true masters of this ordinary yet peculiar commercial world. I saw the stylish women at the Katherin Fashion Store wearing the latest designs from their own store, confidently striding to the rhythm of rock music to greet customers. Across the street, the male and female partners at the Heroine Clothing Store were also using young female employees to meet the challenge from their competitors. I saw a bride in a wedding procession wearing a unique and rare wedding dress, immediately attracting the attention of "business spies" who sketched, photographed, and followed her. Within a day, this wedding dress appeared in the stores on Women's Street and became a popular item. I saw the female entrepreneur Ou Yang Su Hong, dressed fashionably, beautiful and elegant, living in a luxurious home, and successful in her career, yet also experiencing moments of disappointment, loneliness, and pain. I saw her competitor Bai Yan, hot-tempered and straightforward, daring to speak her mind, with a pure heart and steadfast emotions, holding her own in both business competition and romantic rivalry. I saw the male owner of the Akun Shoe Store falling into a trap and buying a large batch of unsold goods, desperately shouting, "Cheap sale, big discount, these are the latest trend from the Northwest."

In short, the film "Women's Street" presents a vibrant and colorful, dazzling array of scenes, showcasing a corner of contemporary urban commercial culture in the south. It is not a live recording of the bustling market scene, but rather a collection of various human conditions in the wave of reform and opening up, with a large amount of information, considerable viewing value, and recognition value. It can be seen as a contemporary screen of urban life. It is not a comedy aimed at making people laugh, but it can be considered an entertaining film full of charm, both vulgar and elegant. Its narrative is concise and straightforward, simply telling the story of two beautiful women pursuing a plain and ordinary "little man." Each scene is used to depict the living and emotional styles of contemporary urban youth, their pursuit and exploration of life in the new commodity economy order, their joys and troubles, opportunities and challenges, careers and love. It does not avoid the confusion, unrest, and anxiety that the imperfect market economy and imperfect legal system bring to people's material and spiritual lives, nor does it avoid the negative impacts that commodity competition brings to people. However, its aesthetic focus is more on the positive, healthy, and beneficial influences that the era of reform and opening up has on improving the quality of modern people. It naturally reveals the historical process of a new generation establishing new concepts of information, efficiency, value, competition, credit, equality, and legal awareness, without a hint of preaching. Indeed, life itself contains endless enlightenment for people. If the beautiful women on Women's Street had not gained personal independence in commodity competition and broken away from dependence on men, our female protagonist Su Hong would not have asked, "Why can women depend on men when men are strong? Why can't men depend on women when women are strong?"

The main actors of "Women's Street" are all newcomers to the film industry, which is quite different from the practice of overseas entertainment films that often use big stars to increase box office appeal. The actress Chen Ling, who plays Ou Yang Su Hong, is a shop owner in real life who co-founded a fashion store. She is not only an amateur fashion model but also a fashion design enthusiast. The actress Mao Hai Tong, who plays Bai Yan, is a dancer who won the bronze medal at the "1988 Guangzhou International Dance Festival." Their performances are based on real-life experiences, so they can achieve a natural and unadorned state. "Women's Street" is beautiful in people, scenery, emotions, objects, and music. These elements are integrated to enhance the artistic level of this entertainment film.

    妙趣横生的《女人街》
    思忖
    我任由张良导演的引领，从嘈杂热闹的“雅马哈鱼档”，来到繁华富丽的
  “女人街”。
    这里金银首饰、腰带提包、文胸内衣、时装鞋帽等各种妇女用品琳琅满目，应有尽有；店面装潢、橱窗摆设、灯箱布置，五光十色，争奇斗妍，各有千秋。年轻漂亮的女企业家是这个既普通又奇异的商业世界的真正主人。我看到凯莎琳时装店的靓女们穿着本店新试制的新款式，正落落大方地踏着摇滚音乐的节拍迎着顾客走来，对面雄燕服装店的男女拍档也在起用年轻女店员以迎接对手的新挑战；我看到街头迎亲队伍中俏丽的新娘身着一件款式新颖罕见的婚纱，立刻受到“商业间谍”的跟踪、速写、拍照，时隔一天这种婚纱已先后出现在女人街的店面上成为走俏商品；我看到女强人欧阳穗红穿着入时、美丽端方、居室豪华、事业发达，却也有失意、孤寂和痛苦的时候；我看到穗红的竞争对手白燕热辣爽朗、敢说敢做、心地坦荡、情意执著，在商业竞争和情场角逐中倒有相当的实力；我看到阿坤鞋店的男老板落入圈套趸进了一大批滞销货，急得他扯开嗓门吆喝：“贱卖了，廉价大酬宾，这是大西北最新潮的破鞋”……
    总之，电影《女人街》以它姹紫嫣红、千姿百态，令人眼花缭乱、目不暇接的流动画面，向我们展示了当今南国都市商业文化的一角。它不是熙熙攘攘、人潮如涌的市场盛况的实景录相，却荟萃了改革开放商品经济大潮中形形色色的众生相，包容了很大的信息量，有相当的观赏价值和认识价值，可以当做一幅当代银幕的市井百态图来读。它不是一部志在逗人开怀大笑的喜剧片，却算得上是一部妙趣横生、大俗且又大雅的娱乐片。它叙事简洁明快，无非是述说两个靓女同时在追求一个其貌不扬也无甚雄才大略的普普通通的“小男人”。每一个场景画面都用来抒写当代都市青年的生存方式和情感方式，他们在新的商品经济秩序中的人生追求和探寻，欢乐和困扰，机会和挑战，事业和爱情。它没有回避很不完善的市场经济和很不健全的法制秩序给人们的物质生活和精神生活带来的惶惑、骚动和不安，没有回避商品竞争给人们带来的某些消极的影响，但它的审美兴奋点更多地是放在改革开放的时代生活对于提高现代人的素质的积极、健康、有益的影响上面。它把一代新人正在确立起崭新的信息观念、效益观念、价值观念、竞争观念、信誉观念、平等观念、法制观念的历史进程，用饶有趣味的生活画面自然呈露出来，而没有一丝一毫的说教气。的确，生活本身蕴含着对世人的无尽启迪。倘若女人街的靓女们不在商品竞争中摆脱了对男人的依附和取得了人格的独立，我们的女主人公穗红是不会发生“为什么男人强了，女人可以依附；女人强了，男人就不能依附”的诘问的。
      《女人街》的主要演员都是初登影坛的新手，这一点同海外娱乐片往往起用大明星以增加票房号召力的惯例是大相径庭的。饰演欧阳穗红的陈玲，在现实生活中就是与人合伙开办时装店的店东，她既是业余时装模特儿，又是时装设计爱好者，饰演白燕的茅海童则是在“八八年羊城国际舞蹈节”上荣获铜牌奖的舞蹈演员，她们的表演都是以实生活的体验为依归，所以能进入“清水出芙蓉，天然去雕饰”的境界。《女人街》人美、景美、情美、物美、歌也美，这些都作为不可或缺的影象元素整合在一起，提高了这部娱乐片的艺术品位。
