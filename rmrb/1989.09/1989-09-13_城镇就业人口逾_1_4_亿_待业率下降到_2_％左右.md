By the end of 1988, China's urban employment population reached 142.67 million, a 50% increase from 1978, equivalent to 9.3 times that of 1949. In the past decade, urban new employment has cumulatively reached over 78 million people, and the urban unemployment rate has dropped from 5.4% in 1979 to around 2%. A relevant official from the Ministry of Labor pointed out that achieving an increase in the employed population while continuously improving labor productivity is a remarkable accomplishment, attracting global attention.

After the founding of New China, the Party and the government have attached great importance to the issue of labor employment. In the early years of liberation, based on the active restoration and development of production, the problem of employment for over 4 million unemployed people left over from the old society was basically solved in just a few years. With the development of socialist construction, the newly grown urban labor force was gradually arranged. Especially in the past decade of reform and opening up, under the national unified planning and guidance, the policy of combining labor department job introductions, organized employment, and self-employment was implemented, breaking through the employment system of unified allocation, and opening up an entrepreneurial path for employment. At the same time, the development of the tertiary industry was encouraged and promoted, increasing the employment capacity, and establishing labor service companies, etc., bringing a new situation to urban employment work.

　　城镇就业人口逾1.4亿
　　待业率下降到2％左右
    本报北京9月13日电　记者江绍高报道：到1988年底，我国城镇就业人口达到14267万人，比1978年增长50％，相当于1949年的9.3倍；近十年中，城镇新就业的劳动者累计7800多万人，城镇待业率从1979年的5.4％下降到2％左右。劳动部有关方面负责人在介绍这一情况时特别指出，在劳动生产率逐年提高的同时实现就业人口的增加，是一件很了不起的事情，成就举世瞩目。
    新中国建立后，党和政府对劳动就业问题给予高度重视。解放初期，在积极恢复和发展生产的基础上，短短几年时间就基本上解决了旧社会遗留下来的400多万失业人员的就业问题。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，对城镇新成长的劳动力又逐步做了安置。尤其是在改革开放的十年中，在国家统筹规划和指导下，实行劳动部门介绍就业、组织起来就业和自谋职业相结合的方针，突破了统包统配的就业制度，开辟了创业式的就业道路。同时鼓励和提倡发展第三产业，增大就业容量，创办劳动服务公司等，使城镇就业工作出现了新局面。
