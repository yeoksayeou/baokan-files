The People's Daily reports: On September 15, the French newspaper *European Times* published an editorial titled "It is Most Despicable to Vilify One's Own Country," exposing and refuting the despicable behavior of individuals like Yan Jiaqi and Wu'er Kaixi, who use vilification of their own country to gain personal capital.

The article states that after the June 4th incident in Beijing, many so-called "democracy activists" fled abroad through various channels and continued their activities against the Chinese government.

These "activists" want to make France their stronghold and base for opposing the current Chinese government. Various "heroes" have appeared in Paris, creating quite a stir.

However, after carefully examining their speeches, statements, or interview records, people have formed two main impressions: First, they continue to spread lies without any shame. For example, Wu'er Kaixi, who fled before the clearing of Tiananmen Square, brazenly claimed that he personally saw students falling in rows on Tiananmen Square. Recently, Hou Dejian's diary, which personally witnessed the entire clearing process, gave him a resounding slap in the face. Second, all their statements paint a bleak picture of China's current situation, with nothing but vilification and threats to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party and the current Chinese government.

Observing the performances of these "activists" over this period, overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent have come to see their true faces more clearly. Are they bringing glory to China? Are they seeking happiness for the Chinese people? An elderly overseas Chinese in France said it well: "The people have fed them with their blood and sweat, but they flee abroad to curse their own country and the legitimate government, what kind of skill is that?" The famous French journalist Simon Leys, during his visit to China, said: "I am an opposition figure. However, I never criticize my country's government abroad." People of insight in Western countries understand this basic principle: one must maintain the dignity of their country abroad. If we talk about national character and personal integrity, this issue best reflects a person's national character and integrity.

Fang Lizhi once proposed the absurd idea of inviting a foreigner to be the Prime Minister of China, which has been unanimously condemned by Chinese people with a conscience; Wu'er Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi's calls for foreign countries to sanction China have long lost their market among overseas Chinese. They rely on certain forces to support them abroad, engaging in activities against the current Chinese government. Although they may be arrogant for a while, they are truly despicable and pathetic!

Wu'er Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi, along with other "democracy activists," move mysteriously in Paris. Who do they associate with? Who provides for their food, shelter, and clothing? Who is the most enthusiastic in promoting their activities? Those with discerning eyes can see it clearly.

We can foresee that those who vilify their own country to gain personal capital will not have a good ending. When their usefulness is exhausted, their act will be over.

We must also mention that the friendly relations between France and China, built over more than 20 years, will not be easily destroyed by these few "activists." According to international conventions, a country does not allow hostile elements of a related country to engage in activities to overthrow the government of the related country on its soil. With the passage of time, the truth of the matter will inevitably be gradually understood, leading to a correct judgment. One day, the illegal activities of Wu'er Kaixi, Yan Jiaqi, and others will be spat upon by people from all walks of life in France and the broad overseas Chinese community. Because those who do not love their own country are the most despised by people!

### 法国《欧洲时报》发表社论　谩骂自己国家最可鄙

　　法国《欧洲时报》发表社论
　　谩骂自己国家最可鄙
    本报讯　法国《欧洲时报》9月15日发表了一篇题为《谩骂自己国家最可鄙》的社论，揭露和批驳严家其、吾尔开希之流靠谩骂自己国家捞私人资本的丑恶嘴脸。
    文章说，北京“六四事件”后，不少所谓的“民运斗士”，通过各种渠道逃到国外，继续从事反对中国政府活动。
    这批“斗士”们想把法国作为他们反对中国现政府的重镇和基地。各路“英雄”纷纷在巴黎登场，颇有一番来势汹汹的样子。
    但是人们在仔细看了他们的发言、声明或访问记录后，得出的印象不外乎两个方面：一是继续脸不红、心不跳地造谣。如早在天安门清场前就溜掉的吾尔开希，却大言不惭地说什么他亲眼看见天安门广场上的学生一排又一排地倒下去。不久前，亲自目击清场全过程的侯德健的回忆日记，重重地打了他一耳光。二是他们的所有言论，把中国现状讲得漆黑一团，除了谩骂和狠狠地扬言要推翻中国共产党和中国现政府外，别无新意。
    静观这段时间以来这批“斗士”们的表演，海外广大的华侨、华人对他们的面目亦看得越来越清楚。他们是在为中国争光吗？他们是在为中国人民谋幸福吗？一位旅法老华侨说得对：“人民用血汗养活了他们，他们却逃到国外来咒骂自己的国家和合法政府，算哪家本领？”法国著名记者佩雷菲特在中国访问时说：“我是反对派人士。不过，我从不在国外批评我国政府。”西方国家有识人士都懂得这个基本原则，在国外一定要维护国家的尊严。如果要谈国格、人格，在这个问题上也最能反映出一个人的国格和人格。
    方励之曾经提出要请一个外国人来当中国总理的谬论，已受到有良知的中国人的一致谴责；吾尔开希和严家其等呼吁外国来制裁中国的叫喊在海外华人中间也早没市场。他们在国外靠着某种势力的豢养，干着反对中国现政府的勾当，虽嚣张一时，其实可鄙又可悲！
    吾尔开希和严家其以及其他“民运斗士”们在巴黎出没神秘，接触的都是什么人，吃住用由谁提供？为他们的活动鼓吹最积极的又是谁？明眼人都看得清清楚楚。
    我们可以预见，靠谩骂自己国家捞私人资本的人下场一定不会好。当他们的利用价值光了的时候，他们的戏也就演完了。
    我们还要提及的一点是，法国和中国20多年建立起来的友好关系，绝不会那么轻易为这几个“斗士”所破坏。按照国际公约，一个国家不容许关系国的敌对分子在其国土上干着颠覆关系国政府的勾当。随着时间的推移，事情的真相也必然逐步被人们所了解，从而最终能作出正确的判断。迟早有一日，吾尔开希、严家其等人的非法活动会受到法国各阶层人士和广大华侨的唾弃。因为不爱自己国家的人，最为人们所不齿！
