The Cultural Revolution began the year I was in second grade, when I was wide-eyed and curious about the world. However, China experienced an unprecedented book shortage. Later, I don't remember where I got a collection of outstanding works from the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. There was an article describing the hardships faced by Chinese and Soviet railway designers as they surveyed and designed the Lanxin Railway, enduring wind and rain. Those of us from the Urumqi Railway Bureau were born as the Lanxin Railway extended westward, and we have a natural affinity for this road. As soon as I saw the thick book containing an article about the Lanxin Railway, I eagerly devoured it.

Oh, it turns out that the Lanxin Railway was supposed to connect with the Soviet border. The current Urumqi West Station should not be the end of the western railway in China.

Later, when I traveled by car west of Urumqi, I saw the bridge piers and the roadbeds left behind after the railway construction was halted in 1959. They might have long since carried the wheels of history, but history turned them into endless dreams and endless hopes.

The blue waves of the sea crash against the southeastern coast, and the reform and opening up made people in Xinjiang think of reviving the "Silk Road." Finally, on May 1, 1985, the groundbreaking ceremony for the first phase of the northern Xinjiang railway, the western section of the Lanxin Railway, was held at Urumqi West Station. The northern Xinjiang railway began to push westward.

The longing for the road is actually a desire for exchange. In the 1950s, many young people from the interior had read works by Russian writers and sang "The Red Berries Bloom," coming to Xinjiang to find "by the clear little river, there are two beautiful white poplars," to feel the depth of the moonlit prairie and the solemnity of the vast wilderness; to appreciate the beauty of the girls dancing with scarves by the campfire and the bravery of the riders on horseback; to experience the unyielding spirit of struggling with nature. But the young people of the 1950s could not realize these wishes by train.

Since 1985, the "Orient Express" tourism group has entered China from the western border, exploring ancient sites in the Tian Shan mountains north and south, seeking the path that an ancient and great nation took more than a thousand years ago to leave the mountains, leave the desert, and go out into the world. The opening of this road reflects our pioneering spirit. However, the "Orient Express" tourism group had to travel by car for a section of the journey within Xinjiang, which was regrettable.

In July of this year, at the invitation of the Chinese Xinjiang Railway Construction Delegation, the Soviet Railway Construction Delegation visited China. In Beijing and Urumqi, they held talks on the connection of the two countries' railways and the opening of international transit. The successful talks were inspiring, and the completion of the second Eurasian Continental Bridge is imminent. This bridge, starting from Lianyungang in the east, following the Longhai Line and the Lanxin Line, crossing the heart of the Eurasian continent, and reaching Rotterdam in the Netherlands, is described by economist Ma Hong as the "golden belt" that adorns the economic physique of our country, with a promising future. The road is right beneath our feet.

The Soviet Railway Construction Delegation visited the Urumqi Railway Bureau, expressing admiration for the working enthusiasm of Chinese railway workers and surprise at the comprehensive and excellent cultural and educational facilities of the railway cultural palace. During the reception, both sides had a feeling of reunion. Songs and dances are a special language that can transcend national and ethnic boundaries, let alone Xinjiang and the Soviet Union having several common ethnic groups, and discussing a common cause—railways. With the completion of the China Alashankou-Soviet Friendship Station, we will become more familiar with each other and follow the railway to find many lost dreams. The dream of Sun Yat-sen to turn China into a great port in the East will soon become a reality.

The train speeds along the newly built western section of the Lanxin Railway, broadcasting welcome speeches in both Chinese and Russian. Chinese and Soviet personnel ride together on this section of the line, a first in Xinjiang's history, which cannot help but evoke deep emotions. Originally, all the station buildings on the Lanxin Line were of a uniform Soviet style, with triangular roofs and thick yellow mud walls; while the new line's station buildings are of a distinct Xinjiang ethnic style, with light green as the main color and concrete structures. History once left a blank page here, but the railway has connected it again, and so obviously.

After getting off the train at Kuitun, we changed to a car. For those who build railways, there is nothing more happy and proud than seeing the railway extend forward. The 63-year-old manager of the Northern Xinjiang Railway Company was the one who laid the railway from the northeast to the northwest. Originally, he wanted to lay the railway all the way to the border. Although this wish was realized thirty years later, it was still realized.

The Soviet Almaty Railway Bureau chief, who will directly engage in international transit with us, is 62 years old, with tears in his eyes. Does he also remember a lot? These two old comrades, who were young men and could not shake hands at the border, finally shook hands on the railway line. The bridge piers that had been long awaited for thirty years finally connected the Eurasian Continental Bridge. It will carry the giant wheels of the times, allowing more young people to find the dream prairie, the dream wilderness...

　　第二座欧亚大陆桥
　　邓洁
      “文革”开始那年我上小学二年级，正睁着一双好奇的大眼睛看世界，中国历史上却开始了从未有过的书荒。后来，我不知从什么地方弄了一本建国十周年的优秀作品集，有一篇文章是描写中苏两国铁路设计人员风餐露宿，勘探、设计兰新铁路的。乌鲁木齐铁路局的我们这一代人都是随着兰新铁路向西延伸而出生的，对这条路有天然的血肉感情，一看见这厚厚的书里有关于兰新铁路的文章就如饥似渴地读起来。
    哦，原来兰新铁路是要在中苏边境接轨的，现在的乌鲁木齐西站不应该是我国西部铁路的一个句号。
    后来坐汽车来往于乌鲁木齐以西的公路上，看见了1959年铁路停工后留下的桥墩、匍伏在大地上的路基，它们也许早就应该背负起时代的车轮，但历史却让它们变成无穷无尽的梦想，无穷无尽的期盼。
    蓝色的海浪冲击着东南沿海，改革开放使新疆人想到重振“丝绸之路”。终于，1985年5月1日在乌鲁木齐西站举行了兰新铁路西段即北疆铁路第一期工程的开工典礼，北疆铁路从此向西节节推进。
    对道路的向往实际是一种对交流的渴望。五十年代，内地很多青年曾经读了俄罗斯作家的作品，唱着《红莓花儿开》的歌，来新疆寻找“在那清清的小河旁，有两棵美丽的白杨”的地方，去感受月光下大草原的深沉和一望无际旷野的凝重；去领略篝火旁姑娘挥动头巾跳舞的优美和马背上骑手的骁勇；去体验与大自然抗争时强悍不屈的精神。但是，五十年代的年轻人没有能坐火车实现这些愿望。
    自1985年起“东方快车”旅游团从中国西口入境，在天山南北寻古探幽，寻找一个古老而伟大的民族在一千多年前走出高山，走出沙漠，走向世界的道路。这条道路的开辟反映了我们的开拓精神。但是
  “东方快车”旅游团在新疆境内有一段路却要坐汽车旅行，这不能不让人感到遗憾。
    今年7月，应中国新疆铁路建设代表团的邀请，苏联铁路建设代表团来中国访问，在北京和乌鲁木齐就两国铁路的接轨及国际联运开通等问题举行了会谈。会谈的圆满成功令人精神振奋，第二座欧亚大陆桥的建成指日可待。这条东起连云港，沿陇海线、兰新线，横穿欧亚大陆腹地、直达荷兰的鹿特丹的大陆桥，在我国境内的一段被经济学家马洪称之为“装点我国经济体魄的金腰带”，前景喜人。路就在脚下。
    苏联铁路建设代表团来乌鲁木齐铁路局参观，他们对中国铁路职工的工作热情表示敬佩，对铁路文化宫完备良好的文化教育设施感到惊讶。联欢时，双方都有一种久违了的感觉。歌和舞本来就是可以超越民族和国界的特殊语言，更何况新疆和苏联有好几个共同的民族，而且所谈的是共同的事业——铁路。随着中国阿拉山口——苏联友谊站的建成，我们双方会变得熟悉起来，并沿着铁路去寻找很多遗落的梦，孙中山先生所希望的将中国变为东方大港的梦想很快就能成为现实。
    列车在新建的兰新铁路西段奔驰，广播室里用汉、俄两国语言播送着欢迎辞，中苏两国人员共同乘坐一列火车在这段线路上行驶，这在新疆历史上是第一次，不能不让人感慨万千。原来兰新线上的站房都是清一色的苏式结构，三角形屋顶、厚厚的黄色土墙；而新线上的站房却都是具有新疆民族特色的，以淡绿色为主色调的混凝土建筑。历史，曾在这里留下了一页空白，而铁路又把它联接了起来，而且是那样显而易见。
    到奎屯下火车后改乘汽车，对于修铁路的人来说，没有什么比看着铁路向前延伸而更幸福、更自豪的事了，六十三岁的北疆铁路公司经理当年就是铺着铁路从东北到西北的，原来是想着一直把铁路铺到边境线的，虽然三十年后这个愿望才得以实现，但毕竟还是实现了。
    将和我们直接进行国际联运的苏联阿拉木图铁路局局长今年六十二岁，眼里噙满泪花，他是不是也想起很多？这两位已生华发的老同志，小伙子的时候没能在边境线握手，现在还是在铁路线上握手了。那一直期待了三十年的桥墩终于联接了欧亚大陆桥，它将背负起时代的巨轮，让更多的年轻人去寻找那梦中的大草原，梦中的旷野……
