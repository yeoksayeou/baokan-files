As summer turns to autumn, representatives from 159 countries gather in New York to prepare for the 44th United Nations General Assembly, which begins on September 19, to discuss major global issues.

The international situation has further eased this year. The trend of moving from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to relaxation between the East and West continues, but it is not as if the world is completely peaceful and all problems are solved. Although U.S.-Soviet relations have improved, they still compete in various aspects; the pace of the arms race has slowed, but it has not stopped; the "hotspots" of regional conflicts have generally cooled down, but the problems are far from fundamentally resolved. The global economy is growing slowly, especially in many developing countries where the economy is stagnant and debt burdens are heavy. The gap between the rich and poor in the North and South has widened, and the unreasonable international economic order urgently needs improvement. Since the world still faces the two major tasks of maintaining peace and seeking development, this session of the General Assembly will still focus on the two major issues of peace and development.

This session's provisional agenda includes 149 items, with content similar to the previous session. However, new developments in the international situation give this session new characteristics.

First, promoting the momentum of disarmament. The U.S. and Soviet Union have agreed to dismantle and destroy all intermediate-range nuclear missiles and have begun the process of nuclear disarmament. This move is beneficial for easing the global situation. However, due to mutual distrust, both sides continue to strengthen their military capabilities, so the arms race has not stopped, only the focus has shifted from nuclear weapons to space weapons. Moreover, the U.S. and Soviet Union, as well as the NATO and Warsaw Pact blocs, still possess a large number of strategic nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons, and conventional weapons far exceeding defensive needs, and the danger of military conflict still exists. Therefore, disarmament remains an important issue for this session, and many countries will strongly demand that the U.S. and Soviet Union continue the disarmament process.

Second, highlighting the debt problem. This year, the foreign debt situation of developing countries has further deteriorated, exceeding $1.3 trillion. The "Brady Plan" proposed by Western developed countries to solve the debt crisis is merely a drop in the bucket. Many debt-ridden countries, due to excessive debt, have deteriorating economic conditions, insufficient foreign exchange earnings, and rapidly rising inflation, leading to a declining standard of living and social unrest. The deterioration of the economies of debtor countries will inevitably directly affect the creditor countries. Therefore, the UN Secretary-General recently proposed that the debt issue should be a key topic for discussion at this session. This proposal has been widely welcomed. However, while the major creditor countries have changed their previous passive attitude, it is likely that they will still be reluctant to agree to substantive measures to solve the debt problem.

Third, continuing the discussion on the Cambodian issue. The recent international conference on Cambodia held in Paris failed to make any substantive progress due to Vietnam's rigid attitude, and this session will continue to discuss the Cambodian issue. Many countries will emphasize the need for Vietnamese troops to withdraw completely from Cambodia under UN supervision to achieve a public, reasonable, and comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem. However, Vietnam still lacks the sincerity to solve the Cambodian issue. On the one hand, it claims to withdraw completely from Cambodia by the end of this month, but on the other hand, it does not accept UN supervision and attempts to remove the Cambodian issue from this session's agenda, and plans to use the "vacant seat" method to deny the legitimate status of the Khmer Rouge in the General Assembly. Vietnam's plot has alerted many countries, and complex struggles are bound to occur at this session.

Fourth, regarding environmental protection. Climate change, ecological balance, and environmental protection increasingly affect people's lives and economic development and have become urgent issues of common concern to humanity. This session will once again focus on these issues. It is evident that the participating countries will continue to call on developed countries to take more responsibility and obligations to solve the environmental problems on which human survival depends.

The current easing of the international situation is the result of the joint efforts of all countries in the world. Including China, many developing countries advocate developing international relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and establishing a new international political order. The vast majority of countries will continue to work together at this session of the United Nations General Assembly to promote further easing of the international situation and call for strengthening South-North dialogue and international economic cooperation. These reasonable proposals will undoubtedly make new contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting development.

In addition, some observers here point out that at this session, some Western countries may raise some issues that are purely internal affairs of sovereign states. If so, it is bound to provoke some debate. This is something that people are closely watching and being vigilant about.

### 展望四十四届联大

　　展望四十四届联大
　　本报记者　刘开宸
    夏去秋来，159国的代表们来到纽约，准备参加将于9月19日开始的第44届联合国大会，共议世界大事。
    今年的国际局势有了进一步缓和。东西方从对抗走向对话、从紧张走向缓和的势头仍在继续，但并不是天下太平，万事大吉了。美苏关系虽然有所改善，但仍互为对手在各方面争夺；双方军备竞赛的势头有所减缓，但并未偃旗息鼓；地区冲突的“热点”普遍降温，但问题远未根本解决。世界经济增长缓慢，特别是许多发展中国家经济停滞，债务负担沉重，南北之间的贫富差距进一步拉大，不合理的国际经济秩序亟待改善。正由于当今世界仍面临着维护和平与谋求发展两大任务，因此，本届联大仍将面临和平与发展两大课题。
    本届联大的临时议程共有149项，主要内容与上届类似。但国际形势的新发展使本届联大具有新的特点。
    一、推动裁军势头。美苏已同意拆除和销毁全部中程核导弹，并开始了核裁军的进程。此举有利于世界局势的缓和。但是，由于双方互不信任，仍在继续加强军事实力，因而军备竞赛并未停止，只是竞赛重点有所改变，即核武器转向太空武器。而且，美苏两国以及北约和华约两大集团仍拥有大量的战略核武器、战术核武器和远远超过防卫需要的常规军备，军事冲突的危险依然存在。所以，裁军问题仍是本届联大的重要议题之一，许多国家将强烈要求美苏继续裁军进程。
    二、突出债务问题。今年，发展中国家的外债情况进一步恶化，现已超过1.3万亿美元，西方发达国家旨在解决债务危机的“布雷迪计划”只是杯水车薪。许多债务国由于负债太多，经济情况不断恶化，外汇收益入不敷出，通货膨胀急剧上升，生活水平日趋下降，社会动荡不宁。债务国经济的恶化，势必使债权国受到直接影响，所以联合国秘书长最近提出，债务问题要作为本届联大讨论的重点。此说深受各方欢迎。但是，主要债权国虽已改变了过去的消极态度，恐怕看来仍难同意采取解决债务问题的实质性措施。
    三、继续讨论柬埔寨问题。最近在巴黎召开的柬埔寨国际会议，由于越南态度僵硬，没有取得任何实质性进展，本届联大要继续讨论柬埔寨问题。许多国家将着重要求越南军队在联合国监督下真正、全面地撤出柬埔寨，以使柬问题获得公开、合理、全面的政治解决。但越南尚无解决柬埔寨问题的诚意。它一方面声称将于本月下旬从柬埔寨完全撤军，但另一方面又不接受联合国监督，还企图把柬问题从本届联大议程上抹掉，并打算以“席位空缺”的办法否定民柬在联大合法地位。越南这一阴谋已引起许多国家警惕，本届联大上势必出现一番复杂的斗争。
    四、关于生态环境保护问题。气候变化、生态平衡、环境保护等，日益影响人们的生活和经济发展，已成为人类共同关心的迫切问题，本届联大将再次予以关注。显而易见，与会各国将继续呼吁发达国家为解决人类赖以生存的环境问题承担更多的责任和义务。
    当前国际局势的缓和，是世界各国共同努力的成果。包括中国在内的许多发展中国家主张在和平共处五项原则基础上发展国际关系以及建立国际政治新秩序。绝大多数国家将在本届联合国大会上继续共同努力，推动国际局势进一步缓和，并呼吁加强南北对话和国际经济合作，这些合理主张对维护世界和平和促进发展必将作出新的贡献。
    此外，此间一些观察家指出，在本届联大上某些西方国家也有可能提出一些纯属主权国家内政的问题。果此，难免引起一番争论。这是人们正在密切注视并加以警惕的。　（本报联合国9月18日电）
