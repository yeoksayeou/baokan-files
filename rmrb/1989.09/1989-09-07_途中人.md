A famous road in the west, a slender transportation line in the west, a great project. But at that time, I felt this road was more like a tightrope stretched in the sky, and the long-distance bus we were riding on was like the soft-soled, satin shoes of a tightrope walker. (At that time, the two buses of the Tibet Transportation Company were like walking, supporting each other as they drove.) At that time, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau seemed to me to be increasingly vast. The herds of Tibetan antelopes leaped towards distant lakes. Those lakes also seemed more distant, leaving only mirror-like reflections. The asphalt barrels left by the road workers in the early years, piled up along the route like the ruins of a village, appeared even more ancient and distant. At that time, the only thing that could be of concern was the stern road beneath our feet, this tightrope, this lifeline. I knew that the southern end of this tightrope was connected to the ancient city of Lhasa, where many people holding candles were walking through an ancient palace, climbing towards the Soul Tower Hall along the stairs. In that great hall, composed of mountains adorned with gold, silver, and jewels, each mountain's core contained a seated true body.

This is a road in the west that is so quiet it makes one want to shout or howl. At that time, the driver was a small, thin, and dark-skinned Tibetan youth, his face blackened as if by furnace fire, with curly hair. A pair of sunglasses rested on his hooked nose. His assistant, another small, thin, and dark-skinned Tibetan youth with curly hair, was relaxing and curled up in the seat. Outside the window, a bundle of white khatas offered by travelers was following the car, making a sound as it slapped against his dream. At that time, I heard a strong rhythm of rock music coming from a hidden speaker above the window. It was like a gust of heavenly wind from paradise, and the passengers immediately felt a sense of joy. The bus moved forward in this joyful rhythm. Suddenly, a baby's cry erupted, like music from the sky. It was so close to me. It was as if our car roof had cut into heaven. It was as if we were being attracted to the arc of heaven. At that time, I did not doubt that the baby's cry I heard was the cry of a baby born in heaven, the most beautiful cry, the most beautiful rock music.

Now, I savor all of this, and even all the hardships, toil, and trivialities of the journey seem sweet, becoming a part of life's enjoyment. Life is generally like this: whether it is adventure, suffering, or struggle... every time, after dealing with it calmly and quietly, one looks back and chews on it, finding poetry in it. Isn't it like this?

Regarding this journey, I once wrote in a letter to an overseas poet: "Driving through Kunlun and Tanggula, the 'ridge consciousness' was extremely strong. The snow-white glaciers, the stern atmosphere, the weary travelers, and the shattered glass along the way, which seemed to be part of a religious ceremony, all made one feel the grandeur of life! Even a child's soft voice would move a man's heart, how could one not feel the grandeur of life!"

    西部的一条举世瞩目的公路，一条纤细的西部运输线，一项伟大工程。但是那时我感到这条路更像是一条绷紧在高空的钢丝，而我们行驶着的长途客车则像踩钢丝表演者脚着的软底缎面鞋（当时西藏运输公司的两部客车正是这样如步行地相互照应着驶行）。那时，青藏高原地面在我看来愈益深远了。壑岸麇聚的藏羚跃动着逃向遥远的湖泊。那些湖泊也更遥远了，只留下镜子似的反光。早年的被筑路工人像村落遗址沿途堆积的沥青桶垛更呈现出
  “墙”的古旧感，变得遥远了。那时更可关切的只有脚底这条严峻的路，只有这段钢丝、这条生命线。我知道，这条钢丝联结着的南端是古老的太阳城，那里，许多秉烛的人正弯身穿行在一座古老宫堡，沿着梯道朝向灵塔殿攀登。在那座以金银宝石镶嵌的山岳构成的大殿，每一座山岳内核都有一具端坐的真身。
    这是西部岑寂得可使人或鸟兽欲一啸叫的道路。那时，开车的是一个瘦小、干巴、墨黑如炉火煅烧的、卷毛的土伯特小伙子，一副墨镜支在鹰钩鼻梁。他的助手，一个同样瘦小干巴墨黑如炉火煅烧的卷毛的土伯特小伙子，正放松筋骨蜷卧在座椅。窗外远行人敬献的一束洁白的哈达绫子正追随汽车在他梦中拍打有声。那时，我听到头顶气窗一侧隐匿的扬声器传出一阵节奏强烈的摇滚乐，好像天堂泄出的一股仙风，乘客们顿时感受到快意。客车就在这种快意的节奏中快意前行。蓦然一阵婴啼爆发直如天上音乐。离我好近。仿佛我们的车篷已切入天堂。仿佛我们正被吸附在天堂的弧面前行。那时我不怀疑我所听到的婴啼是降生天堂的婴孩的啼哭，是最美的啼哭，是最美的摇滚乐。
    现在，我品味着这一切，以至所有旅途艰险、劳辛、琐屑都觉味甘如饴，而成了人生享受。人生大凡也如此：无论冒险，无论受难，无论苦斗……每在事后处之安然恬静时回头咀嚼而悟出诗意存焉。莫非不是如此？
    对于这次旅途，我在写给一位海外诗人的信里就曾作如此追述：“车行昆仑、唐古拉，‘屋脊意识’已极为强烈，煞白的冰山，凛然的大气，困顿的行旅，加之沿途时见的、仿佛出于宗教祭仪而铺陈一地的碎玻璃（我怀疑是天涯客们聚饮抛掷的酒瓶之类），此时即便一声孩子的奶声细语也会令男儿家动容，能不感受到人生的壮丽！”
