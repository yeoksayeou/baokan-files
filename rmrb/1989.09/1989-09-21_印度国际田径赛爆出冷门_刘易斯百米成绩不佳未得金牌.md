The Indian International Athletics Meet saw a major upset as American sprint star Carl Lewis failed to secure the gold medal in the 100 meters.

New Delhi, September 20 (Xinhua) — The loss of American sprint star Carl Lewis was the headline news of the Nehru International Athletics Meet, which opened yesterday in New Delhi.

Beger finished first with a time of 10.46 seconds. After the race, Lewis said, "I was a bit slow, and that's why I lost." Beger commented, "I was very lucky to win. This might be the first and last time."

    印度国际田径赛爆出冷门
    刘易斯百米成绩不佳未得金牌
    新华社新德里9月20日电  美国短跑名将卡尔·刘易斯的失利是19日在这里揭幕的尼赫鲁国际田径赛的头号新闻。
    去年奥运会百米金牌得主刘易斯19日在尼赫鲁国际田径赛上100米比赛中，以0.01秒败给了奥地利选手安·贝格尔。贝格尔以10秒46首先冲过终点。刘易斯赛后说：“我有点迟钝，这是我失利的原因。”贝格尔说：“我很幸运获胜，也许这是第一次，也是最后一次。”
    昨天给人留下深刻印象的是摩洛哥中长跑名将奥伊塔。他轻松地以3分34秒89获得1500米跑金牌，把第二名选手甩了近55米。这一成绩还创了该赛事大会纪录。
    印度短跑名将乌莎在女子200米跑比赛中，以23秒68仅获得第四名。这一成绩远远不如她的最好成绩。获该项目金牌的是牙买加选手格·杰克逊，成绩为22秒72。美国名将阿什福德以23秒28获银牌。
    又讯　刘易斯19日抵达新德里后表示，他将继续在田径场征战三年。他说，他十分喜爱跑步，这已成为他生活中的一个组成部分。他表示在他退出田坛前至少还可参赛三年。
