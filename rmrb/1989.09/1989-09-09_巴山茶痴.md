The Tea Enthusiast of Bashan

The history of tea can be traced back to the ancient Emperor Shen Nong, almost coinciding with the birth of the Chinese nation. Over thousands of years, numerous famous teas have emerged: West Lake Longjing, Huangshan Maofeng, and so on. Each famous tea, from cultivation to production, brewing, and even the tea set, embodies the historical trajectory of Chinese culture. In recent years, a new famous tea has emerged, known as Qinba Yumao. It has won provincial and national gold awards, gaining widespread fame. Behind this success lies the story of a university graduate who, after studying agriculture, spent over twenty years in the deep mountains of southern Shaanxi, facing numerous hardships to cultivate this famous tea.

Entering Bashan

In late autumn, the Bashan Mountains are desolate and rugged. A truck kicks up dust as it bumps along a rough road. In those days, Cai Rugui, fresh out of university, squeezed among a group of ragged mountain villagers, carrying two boxes of books and a 4-catty thin quilt, headed towards the heart of the Bashan Mountains.

More than 20 years ago, the town of Zhenba had only a narrow, desolate street. The only state-run inn was filthy, with dim electric lights and peeling walls. Just a few days earlier, he had been strolling in a lush campus and saying goodbye to his fiancée on the brightly lit streets of Hefei. The contrast was too stark!

Indeed, this was Zhenba County in Shaanxi Province. The "Ba" refers to the Bashan Mountains. It was once part of the Sichuan-Shaanxi revolutionary base, known as "half the sky is red." However, due to its vast mountains and dense forests, the foundation was weak. Even after many years of national construction, it remained a poor place known for receiving subsidies, a place no one wanted to go.

In fact, Cai Rugui should not have gone there. He graduated from the Tea Department of Anhui Agricultural College in 1966. The Cultural Revolution delayed his assignment until 1968, when he was sent to the tea-growing area of Feixi, just 40 li from Hefei. His hometown was nearby, and his ideals were modest. When he left, a classmate, Zhang Wenqiu, who was assigned to the Zhenba tea area, fell ill with liver disease. No one urged Cai Rugui to switch, but he volunteered to exchange places with Zhang: partly out of friendship, partly out of generosity, and also because of the sincerity of intellectuals in the 1950s and 1960s. "A soldier of Chairman Mao listens to the Party's call, going where it is difficult to build a home."

When he first arrived, it happened to be a season of continuous rain. The gray rain clouds covered the mountains, making him feel even more depressed. Moreover, at that time, the extreme left was prevalent, and all university students sent there were suspected of being "stinky ninth category" exiles. Cai Rugui reported to the county sericulture and tea station, but in one month, he was transferred four times, each time to a worse place. Another middle school graduate who was assigned at the same time had his fiancée visit, and she cried as if going to hell when she saw the conditions and left her lover.

Cai Rugui was also confused and depressed. Fortunately, he had experienced hardship since childhood, relying on part-time jobs during summer and winter vacations to pay for his education, deeply understanding the difficulties of life. He also had a competitive spirit, leaving his classmates with the resolute vow: "After graduation, I will see which place is more beautiful and charming." If he retreated, how could he face his "people of Jiangdong"? Since he had come, he decided to settle down. It was not the season to go to the tea mountains in winter, so he prepared for work. Growing up in a watery plain, he was used to traveling by car and boat, but climbing mountains was a painful experience. He decided to conquer this challenge, climbing the highest mountain near the county, Anxian Ridge, every morning and on weekends. After a few months, he could climb up and down the mountain like a local, with his buttocks raised and arms swinging, unhurried.

Losing a Golden Opportunity

In the spring of 1969, Cai Rugui eagerly went to the tea mountains. Passing through the Star Mountain, which was so high that one could almost touch the stars, he climbed with difficulty, following the old Li from the tea station. He finally reached the top, panting and gasping. He thought that after crossing the dangerous mountain, there would be a smooth path, but as soon as he looked, he gasped in shock. The mountains overlapped endlessly, silent and vast, with a "monkey path" dangling like vines into the abyss, 50 li up and down! This was when he truly experienced the harshness of the Bashan Mountains.

After traveling 100 li of mountain roads, it was already dusk. The mountain area had no electricity or candles, and only the fire pit illuminated the dark walls and bamboo houses. Old Li specially found a family with good conditions to rest. The host was very hospitable and offered the bamboo bed. Cai Rugui was very tired, but when he saw it, he was stunned. The bed was only covered with some mountain grass and broken mats, with a strong moldy smell. As soon as he lay down, lice and fleas attacked him, so he had to get up and squat by the fire pit. The mountain night was long, and the mountain wind blew through the old forest, making a monotonous and terrifying howling sound. He felt miserable and sad, squatting until dawn. He did not expect his first night on the tea mountain to be like this, and even less did he expect to squat for over twenty years!

"Where are the tea mountains and tea trees?" He wanted to go up the slope before dawn.

"This is it," Old Li pointed to the slope in front of them.

"What!" He imagined the tea mountains should be like those in Jiangnan, with rows of tea trees and lush greenery everywhere. But here, tea trees grew with white poplar, scattered and sparse, with no sign of tea mountains or tea gardens. Where were the tea leaves? They came to a farmer's house, and the courtyard was clearly drying tea leaves. Old leaves and young shoots were mixed together, with a dog lying in the middle and a group of chickens pecking at the tea leaves. How could this be? He wanted to chase away the chickens and dogs but was stopped. It turned out that corn kernels were mixed with the tea leaves, specifically for the chickens to dig and the dogs to scratch, replacing manual turning. Chicken and dog droppings were also mixed in, and finally, they were trampled and kneaded with feet...

No wonder every time he visited a family, the simple-minded mountain people offered him a large bowl of tea, with tea leaves as big as a palm, stems two inches long, and the tea water black and red, sour and bitter, with no tea flavor at all. The locals said, "Bashan tea is strong, and it's satisfying to drink!"

After further investigation, his mood became even heavier. The tea area he came to was still the typical tea-producing area of the entire county. Each year, only a few tens of thousands of catties of coarse stems and old leaves were produced. Due to the poor quality of the tea, it could only be sold in remote areas, with each catty priced at only 6.8 jiao. The people had no enthusiasm, and life was very difficult. The houses were made of mud walls and thatched roofs, with broken mats and rags on the beds; the food was even worse, with half a year of food shortages, mostly relying on the fire pit to boil some wild fruits and vegetables; men, women, old, and young all had yellow and thin faces, with a dull expression.

For several days, he hesitated on the tea mountain, his mind unsettled. He clearly remembered that in the Tang Dynasty, Lu Yu wrote in the first chapter of the first monograph on tea in China: "Tea is a fine tree of the south, growing in the mountains and valleys of Ba." It clearly referred to this place. When he read it, "Ba Mountains and valleys grow it" had already taken root in his mind, perhaps this was the deepest reason for coming to Zhenba. He never expected that the birthplace of tea with such a long history would still be managed and produced in a primitive way.

Was "The Classic of Tea" wrong? Was the tea here really not good? He looked around, all high mountains and dense forests, with many clouds and fog, with favorable weather and geographical conditions. High mountains and clouds produce famous tea! What was the problem?

He couldn't sit still and decided to find out. He brought his own wok and wooden basin, living in the tea farmer Liu Xunzhong's house, ignoring the fleas biting at night, and the half-vegetable half-grain meals. He devoted himself entirely to tea production. He opened the books and practice notes he brought to the mountains, treated the symptoms, compared formulas, and completely followed scientific methods to select materials, knead, roast, and dry... The result was a tea that was completely different from what the locals drank: the tea leaves were beautiful in shape, the soup was bright, and the tender leaves in the tea cup stretched out, as if showing hope.

The initial success encouraged Cai Rugui greatly. Facing the undulating Bashan Mountains, he wanted to shout loudly, feeling that the mountains were calling him. Suddenly, the responsibility to turn over a new page in the history of the tea mountains rose solemnly in his heart.

After careful consideration, he felt that changing the management of the tea gardens required long-term planning, and changing the current state of tea production was an urgent matter. But at that time, the brigade with a hundred households was so poor that it couldn't even afford a bottle of blue ink, let alone talk about changing manual tea production to mechanized production? He found support from the commune and started a simple small tea factory with primitive methods. Using the existing wooden waterwheel machines in the mountain area to drive double-pot killing green and wooden tea kneading machines; then using charcoal to roast. The result was that the tea leaves significantly improved in quality, with the price increasing from over 6.8 jiao to over 1 yuan. At that time, it was a significant figure, and nearby tea areas envied it. Even the county's deputy secretary, Xue Yuxian, who was inspecting spring plowing, was surprised and personally visited the tea factory, praising it repeatedly, and immediately instructed nearby tea areas to come and learn, promoting it widely. Finally, he tightly held Cai Rugui's hand and said, "We welcome more university students like you, even a hundred!"

In an era when "stinky ninth category" were discriminated against, being praised by the county secretary made Cai Rugui very excited. He immediately volunteered to go to relevant departments to contact simple machinery such as killing green, contributing his youth to changing the face of the tea area...

It happened that in that year, the foreign trade company of the Hanjiang region brought back a batch of killing green machines and kneading machines for the promotion of mechanized tea production, which were not wanted. Cai Rugui heard the news and was overjoyed. Despite the inconvenient transportation, he walked 180 li from Xixiang to Zhenba in one day, preparing to buy machinery and make great plans.

Unfortunately, a bucket of cold water was poured over his head. The higher-level organization notified him not to go to the tea mountains anymore and to immediately join the ideological education work team!

He was stunned, repeatedly requesting to return to the tea mountains, but to no avail. At that time, the struggle over the line was a matter of life and death for thousands of people. Tea was indeed not important enough to be mentioned, how could production be used to suppress revolution? He almost wore the hat of "low ideological awareness of the line." The machinery was not bought, the tea factory was abandoned, the experiment was interrupted, and an opportunity that could have greatly accelerated the construction of the tea area was mysteriously lost.

Ten Years of Wind and Rain

He thought that the ideological education would be over in a while, but it never ended. Criticizing revisionism and the wind of right deviation... This made Cai Rugui very bitter. He begged the leaders, but it was useless. Later, he simply used the opportunity to go to various places as a work team to investigate the tea area, allowing him to visit all the 30-plus tea forests distributed in Zhenba. It was truly "forty-nine steps without a dry foot, seventy-two steps with a dog's hole," eating corn and wild vegetables from a hundred families, sleeping on squeaking bamboo beds; enduring cold and hunger, going a whole night without seeing grain, squatting by the fire pit was a common occurrence. He later trained himself to be able to run 100-200 li on the "monkey path" of the Bashan Mountains in a day. The local villagers admired him:

"Cai Laoyi is good at walking!"

He obtained many absolutely original and precious materials, understanding the history and current situation of the "Zhongyuan Tea" distributed in Zhenba; the blueprint for transformation gradually took shape. He knew that to transform such a vast tea area, one person was not enough. Therefore, he sought support from the commune and brigade at every stop, grasping the practical mindset of the farmers, personally showing them, and finding and cultivating objects among the young people with culture. He compiled his own teaching materials, using the tea picking and processing seasons to teach in practice, achieving twice the result with half the effort. The farmers he trained, Zhou Zhaoding, He Tianzhi, Li Tianhe, and others all became the backbone of the tea area, laying the foundation for the future tea liberation battle.

Ten years of wind and rain were extraordinary. Cai Rugui, who came to Zhenba as a young man, had become a middle-aged man with a beard. Of the more than 30 university students who came to Zhenba at the same time, almost all had left. He was not unmissed by his hometown and family. His wife alone raised their children thousands of miles away in Bengbu, and also took care of his aging parents, the hardship was imaginable. They hoped that Old Cai could return. People are not grass and wood, in how many lonely evenings in the mountainous area, or under the lonely lamp at night, he missed his family and his heart ached. The late Tang poet Li Shangyin's poem "Night Rain to the North" often appeared in his correspondence with his wife. "When will we together cut the candle by the west window?" He seemed to see his wife's reproach, but he could only apologize:

"You ask when I will return, but there is no set time."

There was no set time. The construction of the tea area had just begun, with countless worries on his mind, and he was reluctant to leave. He had already formed an inseparable bond with the lush Bashan Mountains, and his hometown had become strange. When he returned to visit his family, he even dreamed of the tea mountains and tea trees.

But the separation of husband and wife could not last forever. He wrote dozens of letters and did a lot of work, finally convincing his kind-hearted wife to give up the southern city, bringing their children to settle in the Bashan Mountains. His wife graduated from a junior college, with a diploma and a public job, but after coming to Zhenba, she was temporarily unable to find a job. She first went to the riverbank to sift sand, worked as a temporary worker, fed pigs, cooked, and later became a teacher in a kindergarten. Behind every successful husband, there is almost a steadfast and ordinary woman who makes sacrifices for him!

After settling in the Bashan Mountains, Cai Rugui became a local, making many tea farmer friends, and even more diligently climbing the rugged mountain paths in the tea area...

Fortune and Misfortune

The smashing of the "Gang of Four" and the convening of the National Science and Technology Conference, the central government issued a special document: tea should have a great development... It was as if beams of sunlight dispersed the clouds and fog of the Bashan Mountains. Cai Rugui felt that the mountains were green and the sun was bright, and he wanted to have a good fight. Based on his accumulated rich experience and knowledge, his grasp of the development trends of domestic and foreign tea, and the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the Zhenba tea area, he proposed various suggestions to the responsible leaders: quickly develop high-yield dense tea gardens; vigorously promote mechanized tea production; accelerate the training of technical backbone...

In addition, he also knew: why was the ancient and long-standing Zhenba tea area unknown to the world? The key was the lack of famous tea like West Lake Longjing and Huangshan Maofeng. Cai Rugui was well aware of the dialectical relationship between the fame of a product and its development. Zhenba had the advantage of high mountains and clouds and fog, but lacked funds and labor, which was suitable for improving quality. A long-cherished ambition to cultivate a famous Chinese tea in this place had already been included in his struggle goals.

These practical and insightful suggestions were supported by the then Zhenba County Secretary Yuan Guangcai, as well as the Hanjiang Regional Agricultural Commission and Science Commission. Manpower, financial resources, and materials were strengthened, and the entire tea area once presented a lively scene.

Cai Rugui then focused his main energy on the research and development of famous tea. It was not easy! West Lake Longjing had undergone countless generations of predecessors' efforts to become famous. Cai Rugui was not superstitious, he understood a truth, that deep study was the only way to achieve results in any field. He chose the Qili Gorge tea area, which had a high altitude, many clouds and fog, no pollution, and relatively convenient electricity, as the experimental site, and dove in headfirst, selecting tea leaves, pruning tea trees, studying materials, comparing plans, and making progress on multiple fronts. Often, he only slept for four or five hours a day, forgetting to eat was a common occurrence. He compared the characteristics of nearly a hundred famous teas at home and abroad, as well as the habits of drinking tea in the south and north, taking the best of all, forming his own characteristics. From 1978 to 1981, he struggled for several years, developing a tea that had the refinement of southern famous tea and the shape of strips and buds that northerners liked, with the characteristics of displaying buds and showing hair. As soon as it was brewed with hot water, the tea leaves opened up two tender green buds, as if swaying on the branches. The tea water was clear and bright, and a sip of it was refreshing to the lungs. The tea was initially named Qili Fang. Everyone who saw it loved it, and it was highly valued by the regional Science Commission and Agricultural Commission. It was sent to the provincial capital and made a splash, winning the 1981 Provincial Excellent Tea Award. Cai Rugui also received various awards and was elected as a county people's congress representative.

The initial victory, of course, made Cai Rugui happy. But he knew that to truly promote Qili Fang as a famous tea, there was still a lot of work to be done: quality stability experiments needed to be done; experts and scholars needed to be invited for identification; technical identification reports needed to be written... All of these were like the final sprint of a marathon race. He was full of energy, and his competitive state was good.

Unfortunately, he was really naive about society and life. Just as he was deeply engrossed in writing papers and reports in 1982, a disaster suddenly struck him. In fact, when he was elected as a county people's congress representative, the seeds of disaster had already been sown.

Cai Rugui was straightforward and dared to speak out, especially when it came to tea trees and tea leaves. He often regarded himself as an authority, not tolerating "blind command." In the purchase of tea machinery and the implementation of price subsidies for tea farmers, he insisted on his own opinions and offended the responsible leaders, thus earning the reputation of being "arrogant and conceited" and "disrespectful."

In 1982, the country launched a campaign to crack down on economic crimes. Someone reported that Cai Rugui was extravagant, often buying good cigarettes, and hanging a chicken on the handle of the market car. Where did the money come from? It was strange if he hadn't embezzled! After coming to Zhenba for more than ten years, he must have at least "ten thousand yuan"!

Embezzling ten thousand yuan was a big deal! Cai Rugui was listed as one of the "five major cases" in the region, and the provincial and regional special investigation team arrived in Zhenba. But Cai Rugui was not intimidated, and he refuted with reason, but he was labeled with the crime of having a "bad attitude."

On September 18, 1982, Cai Rugui was handcuffed with a "Qin Public 1491" stainless steel handcuff and locked up in a high-walled prison.

To lock up a person, there must be a "charge." So, more than sixty people were mobilized, visiting six provinces and cities where Cai Rugui had gone for tea research, spending tens of thousands of yuan of state funds, but no embezzlement was found. So, they arbitrarily made up 1001.96 yuan from Cai Rugui's work expenses for more than ten years, because embezzling more than a thousand yuan could be sentenced. How was it made up? The unit needed materials for repairing doors and windows, buying two pieces of wood from Cai Rugui for 60 yuan was counted as embezzlement; for the research and development of famous tea, 5 years of sending 18 telegrams was counted as embezzlement... Even the investigators felt it was excessive, but he was still sentenced to two years in prison and locked up in the county prison.

When he first entered, Cai Rugui was locked up with murderers and rapists, and his mood was painful. He stroked his right leg, which was injured while carrying tea machinery on the snowy mountain road, and his left eye, which was blinded while assembling the electric tea roasting pot... He had experienced hardships, but to suffer such a blow, he couldn't understand it!

People's hearts are like mirrors. Many friends and acquaintances, especially tea farmers, came to visit him, giving him comfort; some leaders at the county and district levels also sent messages not to worry, believing that the Party and the government would clarify the matter. So he firmly believed that his problem would be clarified one day, and his mood became more open. His spirit came back, and he read books in prison. The prison guards provided him with all kinds of conveniences. He restudied the latest monographs on tea. Usually, there was no time, and he lacked the mood to think deeply. Now, when he put adversity and honor aside, this study immediately elevated and leaped his more than ten years of practice to a great height of understanding. Not only did he have a deep understanding of tea trees and tea leaves, but he also had an enlightened understanding of human society and even the universe. He suddenly realized that a life without pain was incomplete.

Naturally, what was on his mind was still the tea mountains and tea trees. In the spring of 1983, he was in the high-walled prison, but his heart had already flown to the yellow-green tea mountains. Once a year, there were only a few days of the best experimental time, missing it would mean another year! He was anxious, and twice he submitted reports, requesting to go to the tea mountains to complete the experiment, and proposed to let the prison guards follow for supervision. But after all, it was a prison, and there was no such precedent.

Advancing with Heavy Burdens

In 1984, Cai Rugui was released after being imprisoned for a year and a half.

By the end of 1988, under the repeated inquiries of the district and county leaders, the "slanderous and false words" against Cai Rugui were finally overturned, the original verdict was revoked, and he was declared not guilty. As for the delayed promotion of his professional title and the spiritual suffering of his entire family, he could only ask Cai Rugui to "look forward and consider the overall situation."

But the four years after his release, Cai Rugui made a breakthrough in his career.

On the evening of March 7, 1984, at 8 pm, Cai Rugui was released from prison. On the morning of March 8, he went to the scientific research site of Daoshiya Tea Farm. On March 9, he participated in the county tea technology training class and gave a lecture. In April, he finally completed the small trial of the famous tea...

This was unimaginable for ordinary people. At this time, the news of his wrongful imprisonment returned to his hometown, and classmates and friends sent him letters to return, even his alma mater, Anhui Agricultural College, invited him to take charge of the school's tea farm. At midlife, returning to one's roots, whether relatives or not, hometown people, what a good opportunity. Cai Rugui looked at the green and blue Bashan Mountains, his heart surged and could not be calmed. The once desolate county town now had new buildings and was becoming more prosperous. He had contributed a lot of effort and sweat to this. The more he had experienced hardship, the more he did not want to leave. Besides, he had so many friends supporting him. After his release, many tea farmers sent chickens, rice, and eggs to his home, leaving no names. In addition, his dream of cultivating famous tea had not yet been fully realized. The regional Agricultural Commission, Science Commission, and a large number of county leaders all looked forward to him producing results, and he could not give up halfway. He declined the good intentions of his teachers and friends. He believed that only by truly achieving results in his career and benefiting the people could he truly realize his value.

To do anything well, one must devote one's whole heart to it, and Cai Rugui had devoted his life to it. He nurtured the rare flower with his blood—the famous tea Qili Fang was officially recognized. In November 1984, it was listed as one of the world's scientific and technological celebrities, and Professor Chen Zhen, a first-level professor in the Chinese tea industry, personally led more than 20 domestic tea experts to Zhenba to identify Qili Fang, believing that it had the quality of famous tea and gave it high praise. Professor Chen Zhen stroked his silver hair and smiled at his proud student Cai Rugui: "Qili Fang is like a milk name, now it is going to society, I will give it an academic name." After speaking, the old professor wrote four strong characters on the high-quality paper produced in Zhenba: "Qinba Yumao." The surrounding people cheered.

In 1985, Qinba Yumao became the first famous tea in Shaanxi Province to pass the appraisal, entering the Provincial People's Hall and the Great Hall of the People, and was deeply welcomed by consumers and experts.

Cai Rugui not only cultivated the famous tea Qinba Yumao for Zhenba but also assisted the neighboring Xixiang, Nanzheng, and other tea areas in cultivating famous teas that entered the ranks of the province and the country. More importantly, the emergence of famous teas attracted attention and support from all sides, and the entire Qinba tea area underwent earth-shaking changes.

Just in Zhenba, the tea garden area expanded from the previous scattered 10,000 mu to 30,000 mu of neat and dense planting, basically popularizing modern tea-making technologies such as mechanized killing green and electric pot roasting. The output increased from the previous tens of thousands of catties to 400,000 catties. The best Qinba Yumao was purchased from the tea farmers at 60 yuan per catty. The broad masses of tea farmers truly embarked on the road to prosperity.

Cai Rugui spent more than 20 years in the Qinba tea area after graduating from university. His key role was to make this ancient tea area, with its long history, advance several centuries in the cultivation and management of tea trees and tea gardens, and in the picking and production of tea leaves, from primitive backwardness to scientific civilization.

In 1988, Qinba Yumao won four major awards: the first place among the 11 local famous brand products in Shaanxi Province; the national Torch Program achievement award; the silver medal at the first Chinese Food Expo; and the Golden Crane Award for Chinese Quality and Health Products.

On January 1, 1989, Cai Rugui and Zhenba County Mayor Gong Dechang received the awards from the Great Hall of the People the next day. Famous figures from the capital's cultural and tea circles gathered to appreciate the newly awarded Qinba Yumao. While tasting the tea, they praised it, hoping that Qinba Yumao would go global.

Cai Rugui looked at the hall full of approving and encouraging gazes and smiled. Going global was indeed his next goal to strive for.

    巴山茶痴
    王蓬
    若寻根溯源，茶叶始于上古炎帝，几乎与中华民族同时诞生。延数千年，名茶辈出：西湖龙井、黄山茅峰……每种名茶的栽培、制作、品饮乃至茶具，莫不包容中华文化发展的历史轨迹。近年，又有一种新名茶问世，名曰：秦巴雾毫。连获省级和国家级金奖，名声雀起。其间，却又包含一位农学院毕业的大学生，扎根陕南秦巴深山二十余载，为培育名茶历经坎坷的动人故事。
    初进巴山
    深秋，大巴山苍凉而蛮荒。卡车播扬着尘土，在简易公路上颠簸。当年，刚从大学毕业的蔡如桂带着两箱书和一条4斤重的薄被挤在一堆衣衫破旧的山民之中，驶往大巴山腹地。
    20多年前，镇巴县城仅仄斜着一条凄惶的街市，仅有的一家国营旅舍也肮脏不堪，电灯昏黄、墙壁斑驳……几天前，他还在芳草如茵的校园散步，在华灯初上的合肥街头与未婚妻话别，反差太强烈了！
    是啊，这便是陕西省镇巴县。巴即巴山。曾属川陕革命根据地，红透过半边天。终因山大林深，基础太差，建国多年仍是吃补贴出名，谁也不愿去的穷苦地方。
    其实，也不该蔡如桂去的。他1966年毕业于安徽农学院茶叶系，“文革”延误至1968年分配到距合肥仅40里的肥西茶区。家乡近在眼前，理想不过。临行时，分往镇巴茶区的同学张文柱患了肝病。没人动员蔡如桂，他主动与张文柱对换：半因友谊，半出豪爽，亦不能排除五六十年代知识分子的真诚，“毛主席的战士最听党的话，哪里艰苦哪里去安家。”
    初到时节，恰逢阴雨连绵，灰暗的雨云笼罩山头，倍感沉闷。加之，当时极左盛行，凡来此处的大学生都有被当“臭老九”流放的嫌疑。蔡如桂到县蚕茶站报到，一月竟调四次宿舍，一次比一次差。同时分去的一位中专生，未婚妻来看了一眼，就跟下地狱般哭着与爱人分手了。
    蔡如桂也曾惶惑苦闷。好在他从小家道中落，上学全靠寒暑假打零工挣学费，深知生活艰辛。又有股争强好胜劲儿，告别同学时曾留下“学毕出师，看哪方瑰丽多娇”的铮铮誓言。败退回去，有何颜见“江东父老”。既来则安。冬日不是去茶山时节，他便做准备工作，从小在水网平原长大，出门车船代步，爬山成了痛苦事儿。他决心攻克这关，每日清晨和星期天都去爬县城附近最高的安垭梁。几月下来，他居然能像  当地老乡那样翘起屁股，摆起胳膊，不慌不忙地上下山了。
    痛失良机
    1969年春天，蔡如桂迫不及待地去茶山。途经高可摘星的星子山，危崖高耸，鸟道摩天。得力于一个冬天的锻炼，蔡如桂跟着茶站老李爬的气喘心跳，总算上了山顶。他以为翻过险山就有坦途，可刚看了一眼就直吸冷气，大山重重叠叠，无边无垠，一片沉寂，下山的“猴子道”垂藤般跌进幽谷，一上一下整整50里！他这才领教了大巴山的严酷。
    百里山路赶到，已是暮色苍茫。山区没电没蜡烛，单是火塘把漆黑的墙壁竹楼映得发亮。老李特地找户条件好的农家歇息。主人挺热情让出了竹笆床。蔡如桂困乏极了，可一看愣了，床上仅铺些山草破席，霉腐味直冲鼻子。刚睡下，虱子跳蚤纷纷袭扰，他只好爬起蹲在火塘边。深山夜长，山风吹动老林，发出单调恐怖的呼啸。他心里委曲又凄楚，硬蹲到天明。他没想到茶山第一夜竟这样度过，更没想到一蹲就是二十多年！
    “茶山茶树呢？”他天不亮就想上坡。
    “这不是么。”老李指着眼前的山坡。
    “什么！”他想象的茶山应该像江南茶山，茶树成排，满山碧绿。可这里，茶树与白杨混长，零星分散，哪有茶山茶园模样。茶叶呢？他们来到一户农家，院坝分明摊晒着茶叶，老叶嫩芽混杂，一条狗卧在当中，一群鸡在茶叶中扒拉。这怎么行？他要撵鸡狗却被制止，原来茶叶中撒着苞谷粒儿，专门让鸡刨狗挖，代替人工翻晒，鸡粪狗屎也就混杂其中，完了用脚踩揉……无怪每去一家，纯朴的山民捧出大碗茶，茶叶足有巴掌大，杆儿两寸长，茶水黑红，酸馊苦涩，根本不是茶味。老乡却说：“巴山茶口劲大，喝着过瘾！”
      再仔细了解，他心情益发沉重。他来的这片茶区还是全县产茶典型。每年粗杆老叶算上才万把斤左右。由于茶质低劣，只能销边远地区，每斤仅6角8分。群众没积极性，日子十分苦焦，住房土墙茅舍，床上破席烂被；吃得更糟，半年缺粮，多靠火塘吊罐煮些山果野菜；男女老少都脸色黄瘦，神情麻木。
      一连几日，他在茶山踌躇，心情不能平静。他清楚记得唐代陆羽所写中国首部茶叶专著开篇就载：“茶者，南方之佳木也，巴山峡川生焉。”分明就指此地。当初读时，“巴山峡川生焉”就在脑中生了根，也许这才是来镇巴最深层的原因。他万没想到历史悠久的茶叶诞生地，管理和制作还停留在原始阶段。
      《茶经》记载错了？这儿茶真的不好？他举目四顾，皆高山密林，多云多雾，天时地利俱佳，高山云雾出名茶啊！症结在哪？
    他坐不住了，决心弄个明白。他自置炒锅和木盆，住进茶农刘勋仲家，全不顾及夜间跳蚤叮咬，半菜半粮饭食，全身心投入到茶叶制作。打开背上山去的书籍和实习笔记，对症下药，比较配方，完全按照科学的方法选料、揉搓、烘炒、凉干……结果，制出的茶叶与老乡喝的茶完全两样：茶叶形状优美，汤色鲜亮，嫩绿的叶芽在茶杯中伸展，仿佛向人展示希望。
      初试成功，使蔡如桂大受鼓舞，面对起伏的大巴山，他激动的想扯开嗓门大喊，只觉得千山万岭在对他招唤，暮然间，揭开茶山历史新的一页的责任感在他心间庄严升腾。
      经过思虑，他觉得改变茶园管理需做长远规划，改变茶叶制作现状实乃当务之急。但当时，百十户人家大队穷得连一瓶蓝墨水都买不起，还能妄谈改手工制茶为机械制茶？他找到公社获得支持，土法上马，成立了简陋的小茶厂。利用山区原有的木制水轮机带动双锅杀青、木揉茶机；完了再用炭火烘烤。结果，茶叶明显上了一个等级，价格由6角多提高到1元多。当时是个了不得的数字，附近茶区羡慕，连检查春耕的县委副书记薛雨贤都惊动，亲自到茶厂参观，连声称赞，并立即指示附近茶区都来参观学习，大力普及，末了还紧握着蔡如桂的手说：“你这样的大学生，再来一百我们都欢迎！”
    “臭老九”倍受歧视的年代，能被县委书记称赞，蔡如桂委实激动，他当即自告奋勇，愿意去有关部门联系杀青之类的简易机械，为改变茶区面貌贡献青春……
    凑巧，那年汉中地区外贸公司为普及机械制茶运回一批杀青机、揉茶机正愁没人要。蔡如桂得讯喜出望外，交通不便，竟步行180华里，
    当天从西乡赶到镇巴，准备购买机械，大展宏图。
    岂料，一盆冷水迎头浇下，上级组织通知不要再去茶山，立刻参加路线教育工作队！
    他惊呆了，再三请求返回茶山，都无济于事。当时，路线斗争关乎党变修国变色千百万人头落地的大事。茶叶委实提不上串，怎么能用生产压制革命？他险乎被扣上路线觉悟不高的帽子。机械没买，茶厂荒废，试验中断，一次有可能使茶区建设大大加快的机遇莫名其妙地断送了。
     十年风雨
    他本以为路线教育搞一段就完了，哪有个完呢？批修整风，批林批孔，反击右倾翻案风……这可苦了蔡如桂，找领导死缠硬磨，没用。后来他索性利用到各处当工作队的机会对茶区进行调查，使他有机会对这片川陕交界30多片茶林统统走遍。真正是“四十九道脚不干，七十二道狗钻洞”，吃的苞谷野菜百家饭，睡吱吱做响的竹笆床；挨冻挨饿，一天不见粮米，整夜蹲火塘是家常便饭。他后来锻炼得竟然能一天在大巴山
    “猴子道”上跑一二百里。当地老乡都佩服：
    “蔡老倌好走手！”
      他取得许多绝对原始又珍贵的资料，对整个分布于镇巴的“中园茶”历史和现状了如指掌；改造远景渐成蓝图。他清楚，要对如此广大的茶区进行改造，单枪匹马不行。所以每到一处都争取社队支持，抓住农民务实心理，亲手做给他们看，在有文化的年轻人中寻找培养对象。他自编教材，利用采茶、制茶季节在实践中教授，取得事半功倍效果。他培养的农民技术员周兆定、何天志、李天和等都成为茶区骨干，为日后大打茶叶翻身仗打下了基础。
      十年风雨不寻常。蔡如桂由刚来镇巴的年轻小伙变成胡子巴扎的中年人了。跟他同时来镇巴的30多个大学生差不多走光了。他并非不思念故乡亲人，妻子独自带着孩子在千里之外的蚌埠，还要照顾他年迈的父母，辛苦可以想见。他们盼老蔡能够回去。人非草木，多少个大山区寂寞的黄昏，或深夜的孤灯下，他思念亲人心都发痛。晚唐诗人李商隐那首《夜雨寄北》多次出现在他与妻子的通信中。“何当共剪西窗烛？”他仿佛窥见妻子的嗔怪，可也只能愧疚地推诿：
  “君问归期未有期。”
    哪有个期呢？茶区建设刚刚起步，千头百绕萦系心头，不忍离去啊！他已经与郁郁葱葱的大巴山结下不解之缘，故乡倒有了陌生感。回家探亲，梦里也想茶山茶树。
    但夫妻分居终非长事。他数十次写信、做工作，终于说服善良的妻子舍弃了南方城市，带着孩子到大巴山安家来了。爱人中专毕业，有文凭有公职，可到镇巴后一时安排不上工作，先后到河滩筛沙子，做临时工，喂猪、做饭，后来才在幼儿园当了教师。每一位事业成功的丈夫后面，几乎都有一位为之作出牺牲的坚韧平凡的女性！
      在大巴山区安了家。随乡入俗，蔡如桂巴山化了，交了许多茶农朋友，更加刻苦地在茶区那些崎岖的山道上攀登……
    福祸并降
    粉碎“四人帮”，全国科技大会召开，中央专门下文：茶叶要有一个大发展……宛如一束束阳光驱散大巴山云雾。蔡如桂只觉得满山青翠，阳光明媚，要好好大干一场了。凭借他积累的丰富经验和知识，对国内外茶叶发展趋势的把握，以及镇巴茶区优劣的比较，他向主管领导提出种种建议：迅速发展密植高产茶园；大力普及机械制茶；加快培训技术骨干……
      此外，他还深知：为何镇巴茶区古老悠久却鲜为人知，关键是缺乏像西湖龙井、黄山茅峰那样的名茶。蔡如桂深谙产品知名度与其发展的辩证关系。镇巴资金缺劳力少却有高山云雾的地域优势，宜于提高质量，一个在胸中酝酿已久在此地培育中国名茶的宏愿已开始列入他的奋斗目标。
      这些切合实际又有独到见解的建议得到当时镇巴县委书记袁广才以及汉中地区农委、科委的支持，人力财力物力都得到加强，整个茶区一度呈现出生机勃勃的景象。
      蔡如桂则把主要精力投入名茶研制。谈何容易！西湖龙井不知经过多少代人的前赴后继才名扬天下。蔡如桂不信邪，他明白一个道理，潜心钻研是在任何领域取得建树的唯一途径。他选择了海拔高，云雾多，无污染，同时用电较为方便的七里沟茶区作为试验场地，一头扎下去，选定茶片，剪修茶树，研究资料，比较方案，多头并进，经常是一天只睡四五个小时，忘记吃饭更是常事。他比较国内外近百种名茶特点，以及南北人喝茶习惯，取百家之长，形成自己特点。从1978年到1981年，苦苦奋战几年，研制出一种既有南方名茶精致，又有北方人喜爱的成条成朵形状，显毫露毛特点，冲上开水，茶叶便纷纷展开两片嫩绿的蕊芽，仿佛摇曳枝头。茶水清绿明亮，喝一口清香沁人肺腑。茶叶最初起名七里芳。谁见谁爱，受到地区科委、农委高度重视。送进省城，一炮打响，荣获1981年省优质茶叶奖。蔡如桂也连续获得各级奖励，还当选为县人大代表。
    初战告捷，蔡如桂当然高兴。但他明白真正要把七里芳当名茶打出去还有许多工作要干：要做质量稳定试验；要请专家学者鉴定；要写技术鉴定报告……这一切都犹如马拉松赛跑的最后冲刺。他浑身充满劲儿，竞技状态良好。
    可惜，对于社会人生，他却委实胡涂。就在他潜心撰写论文、报告的1982年，一场灾难突然降到他头上。其实，就在他当选县人大代表的时候，就埋下了灾难的种子。
    蔡如桂脾气耿直，遇事敢于直言。尤其事关茶树茶叶，常以权威自居，容不得“瞎指挥”，在购置茶叶机械，对茶农实行价格补贴等问题上坚持己见，顶撞过主管领导，于是就落下“自傲狂妄”、“目中无人”的话柄。
      1982年全国开展打击经济领域中的犯罪活动。有人反映蔡如桂花钱大手大脚，常买好烟，上集市车把上就挂只老母鸡。哪来的钱？没贪污才怪！来镇巴十几年起码也上“万字号”了！
    贪污万元还得了！蔡如桂被列入了地区“五大要案”，省地专案组亲临镇巴。可蔡如桂不吃这套，据理反驳，又落得个“态度不好”的罪名。
      1982年9月18日，蔡如桂戴上了“秦公1491”号合金钢手铐，关进了高墙铁窗。
      关人总得有“罪状”，于是动用六七十人次，跑遍蔡如桂因研制茶叶去过的六个省市，耗费国家数万元，结果并没有查到蔡如桂一分钱的
  “贪污”款。于是硬从蔡如桂参加工作十几年的报销票据中凑出了1001.96元，因为贪污千元以上可以判刑。怎么凑呢？单位修房缺门窗料，买蔡如桂两块木料60元算贪污；为研制名茶5年中拍发18份电报费算贪污……连办案人员都觉得过份，但仍被判两年徒刑，关进了县大狱。
      刚进去时，蔡如桂和那些杀人犯、强奸犯关在一起，他心情痛苦，抚着为扛制茶机械在冰雪封山的路上摔伤的右腿；为组装电炒茶锅碰瞎的左眼……算得上历经艰辛，却蒙受这样打击，怎么也想不通！
    人心如镜，许多朋友熟人尤其是茶农都纷纷来探视，给他宽慰；地县一些领导也给他捎话不要着急，要相信党和政府会把事情弄明白。于是他深信自己的问题终有一天会水落石出，心情坦荡些了，他的劲头又来了，牢狱里不能干别的正好读书。管教人员为他提供了种种方便。他重新学习了有关茶叶的最新种种专著。平常没有时
  间，也缺静下来思索的心境。如今，当他把逆境荣辱置之度外，这种学习立刻使十几年的实践获得认识上的巨大升华和飞跃。不仅是对茶树茶叶，对人间社会乃至万物天体都有了一种通达的感悟。恍然明白了没有痛苦的人生倒是不完整的生。
    自然，牵心萦魂的还是茶山茶树。1983年开春，他身在高墙铁窗里面，心却早飞向了鹅黄淡绿的茶山。一年一度，就几天最佳试验时间，错过又是一年哪！他心急如焚，两次打报告，要求去茶山完成试验，并提出让管教人员跟上监护。但毕竟是监狱，哪有这种先例。
    负重前进
    1984年蔡如桂关押一年半后才得获释。
    1988年底，在地县领导的一再过问下，对蔡如桂的“污蔑不实之词”才得以全部推翻，撤销原判，宣告无罪。至于耽误的职称晋升，造成全家人的精神痛苦，也只好让蔡如桂“顾全大局朝前看”了。
    但出狱后的4年，蔡如桂却在事业上取得突飞猛进的发展。
    1984年3月7日晚8时，蔡如桂从牢狱获释，3月8日清晨就上了科研场地道士垭茶场。3月9日参加县茶叶技术训练班，登台讲述。4月份最后完成名茶的继前小试……
    这是一般人难以想象的。这时，他蒙冤出狱的消息传回故乡，同学朋友纷纷来信让他回去，连母校安徽农学院都请他去主持学校茶场。人到中年，落叶归根，亲不亲，故乡人，多好的机会。蔡如桂望着黛苍滴翠的大巴山，心潮起伏难平，当年凄惶的县城如今新楼成群，日趋繁华。这其间也有他多少努力和汗水。越是经受过苦难的地方越不忍离去，再说这里有那么多支持他的朋友，出狱后许多茶农把母鸡大米鸡蛋送到家中，名字都不曾留下。此外，他培育名茶的理想还没最后实现。地区农委、科委，县上一大批领导，都盼着他拿出成果，不能半途而废啊。他谢绝了老师亲友的好意。他认定了只有在事业上真正干出成绩，造福于人民才能真正体现他的价值。
    干好任何事情都需要把全身心投进去，蔡如桂是把生命都投进去了。他用心血浇出的奇葩——七里芳名茶正式获得认可。1984年11月，被列入世界科技名人的我国茶叶界一级教授陈椽亲率国内20余名茶叶专家专程来镇巴对七里芳进行鉴定，认为具备名茶品质，给予高度评价。陈椽教授抚着银丝，笑微微地对他的得意学生蔡如桂说：“七里芳算是乳名，现在要走向社会，我给他取个学名吧。”言罢，老教授挥笔在镇巴出产的优质宣纸上，写下苍劲的四个大字：秦巴雾毫。四周一片叫好。
    1985年，秦巴雾毫成为陕西省第一个通过鉴定的名茶，进入了省人民大厦、人民大会堂，深受消费者欢迎和专家关注。
    蔡如桂不仅为镇巴培育了名茶秦巴雾毫，还先后协助邻近西乡、南郑等茶区培育了走进全省全国行列的名茶。更关键的是名茶辈出，引起各方面的关注与重视，财力物力才获得加强，整个秦巴茶区发生翻天覆地的变化。
    仅镇巴，茶园面积就由过去零星分散的万亩扩大到整齐密植的3万亩，基本上普及了机械杀青、电锅烘烤等现代制茶技术。产量则由过去十几万斤提高到40万斤。最好的秦巴雾毫从茶农手中收购也达每斤60元了。广大茶农真正迈上了致富之道。
      蔡如桂大学毕业到秦巴茶区度过20多个春秋。他所起到的关键作用在于，使这片具有古老历史的茶区在茶树茶园的栽培与管理，茶叶的摘采与制作上由原始落后向科学文明迈进了几个世纪。
    1988年，秦巴雾毫连获殊荣，获得四个大奖：陕西省11个地方名牌产品第一名；国家星火计划成果奖；中国首届食品博览会银牌奖；中国质保健产品金鹤奖。
    1989年元月，蔡如桂和镇巴县县长龚德昌从人民大会堂领奖后的第二天，首都文化界、茶叶界知名人士欢聚一堂，品评刚刚获奖的秦巴雾毫。一边品茶，一边称赞，希望秦巴雾毫走向世界。
    蔡如桂望着满厅赞许、鼓励的目光，笑了。走向世界，正是他下一步要努力的目标。
