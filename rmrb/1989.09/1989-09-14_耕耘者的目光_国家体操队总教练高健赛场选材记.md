He has arrived. The crowd looks at this national gymnastics team head coach Gao Jian, who has trained world-renowned athletes such as Li Yuejiu, Huang Yubin, Li Xiaoping, and Xu Zhigang, with admiration. He came with an illness. Due to years of intense and exhausting competitions, his heart can no longer take it, and doctors had ordered him to rest. However, the gymnastics cause weighs heavily on his mind, and the lack of reserve talent makes him anxious.

Upon arriving at the venue, he watches the young athletes intently, committing the names of promising talents to memory. Over the past few days, he has already "discovered" several promising prospects and can recite a long list of names: Li Xiaoshuang from Hubei, Liu Manbin from Heilongjiang, Sang Guangquan from Tianjin, Zhang Wenning from Shandong, Li Yufang from Fujian, Li Li from Guangdong, and Yang Xiaohui from Yunnan. After listing the names, he smiles and says, "We finally have a batch of promising talents. This is a good sign." However, he cannot relax. Gymnastics is a long-term project, and it takes about 8 years for male athletes and 6 years for female athletes to reach their peak. The task ahead is arduous. Gao Jian is both an experienced "prospector" and a "refiner," carrying two heavy burdens.

When the audience enthusiastically applauds the winning athletes, Gao Jian's gaze is fixed on the new and challenging movements. He is captivated by the rings routine performed by 14-year-old Liu Manbin from Heilongjiang and exclaims, "The left, right, and front horizontal and inverted cross show strength, this is a breakthrough." Liu Li from Hunan, Luo Li from Guizhou, and Li Li from Guangdong perform on the uneven bars, executing movements not yet seen in the world's difficulty tables. He remembers these performances vividly.

For a cultivator, he not only focuses on new talents, new movements, and new approaches but also looks far ahead. Without long-term planning, there will be immediate worries. From several competitions, he sees the potential issues of rough movements and unsteady basic techniques, as well as the danger of disconnected training.

Gao Jian suggests that the gymnastics competition system needs reform. Additional points should be awarded for basic techniques and posture, increasing the score for each event to 11 points, with the extra point going to basic techniques and posture.

When Gao Jian sees so many promising talents from all over the country, he thinks more about the responsibilities and burdens of being a coach. He is pained by some coaches who are not dedicated to their work and even leave the profession. He plans to invite experienced senior coaches to pass on their teaching methods to younger coaches, helping them avoid detours.

After the gymnastics competition, Gao Jian goes to the children, shakes hands with the winners, and pats the shoulders of those who cried from losing. Both gestures express love and encouragement. He believes that today's fledglings will become eagles tomorrow, soaring into the sky.

　　耕耘者的目光
　　——国家体操队总教练高健赛场选材记
    他来了，人们对这位曾培养出李月久、黄玉斌、李小平、许志强等世界名将的国家体操队总教练高健投以敬佩的目光。他是带着病来的，由于连年率队征战紧张劳累，心脏已难以承受，医生曾下令让他休息。可是体操运动事业牵动他的心，体操后备力量缺乏更使他焦虑不安。
    来到赛场，他目不转睛地观看上场的小队员，把有希望的小将姓名刻在脑子里。几天来，他已“捕捉”到中意的苗子，顺口说出一大串名字：湖北的李小双、黑龙江的刘满滨、天津的桑广泉、山东的张文宁、福建的李奕芳、广东的李莉、云南的杨晓惠……列举完名字，他微笑地说，苗子总算有了一批，这是可喜的现象。但是并不能松一口气。体操项目周期长，成才晚。男选手大约要8年以上，女子也需6年，任重道远。高健既是一个经验丰富的“选矿者”，又是一个“冶炼者”，肩上压着两副担子。
    当观众起劲地为取胜选手鼓掌时，高健的眼光却紧紧地盯住一个个难新动作。他被黑龙江队14岁的刘满滨所作的吊环动作所吸引，并脱口而出：“左、右、正三面水平十字、倒十字显示出力量，这是一个突破。”湖南的陆莉、贵州的罗莉、广东的李莉在高低杠上穿梭飞行，做出世界难度表上还未出现的动作，对此，他更是牢记在心。
    对于一个耕耘者来说，他不仅把目光放在新人、新动作、新路子上，而且望远看。人无远虑，必有近忧。他从几场比赛中，看到动作粗糙、基本技术不扎实的后患，还发现训练脱节的危险。
    高健建议，今后体操竞赛制度要改革，应在基本技术和基本姿态上实行另外加分，把各单项分数提高到11分，多出来的1分打到基本技术和姿态上。
    当高健看到来自全国这么多有希望的苗子时，更想到教练的责任和担子。他对一些教练不安心工作甚至外流感到痛心。他准备把有多年丰富经验的老教练请出来，给年轻教练传授教学方法，使他们少走弯路。
    体操赛结束后，高健来到孩子们中间，与胜利者握握手，对失利哭鼻子的拍拍肩，两种不同的方式，表示的都是爱，都是鼓励。他相信今天的雏鹰，明天会变成雄鹰，飞向蓝天。
