Within the next two years, 50 key middle schools in suburban areas will receive support for the construction of vocational education bases, with the municipal government allocating 2 million yuan. Starting from the 1990 fiscal year, the levy rate for urban education surcharges will be increased from the current 1% to 2%.

Starting this year and over the next three years, the municipal government will allocate 10 million yuan annually for the construction and adjustment of key disciplines in municipal universities and secondary vocational schools. Additionally, 400,000 yuan will be allocated annually to focus on literacy efforts in impoverished mountainous regions.
