According to statistics, in some places, the income of enterprise employees and individual business households has increased rapidly: the income of employees in 29 enterprises in Nanjing increased by 40.6% in one year (while labor productivity only increased by 6.6%); the number of people with incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan in Zhangjiakou City increased by more than 150 people last year (originally 300 people); among the more than 110,000 individual households in Beijing, nearly 10% have annual incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan, and there are three to four hundred households with annual incomes exceeding 1,000,000 yuan.

Why have these people's incomes increased so rapidly? There are many puzzling aspects to their increased income, and a considerable number of them have increased their income in secretive ways, with the amounts and methods often hidden; some even do not tell their children or spouses, and units keep it strictly confidential. Moreover, there are no vouchers or complete procedures; this kind of income has many names, including money and goods, cash and checks, changing arbitrarily and easily, making it difficult for others to see through. Therefore, some people have given this kind of income a special name: gray income. Gray income refers to the part of income that flows into personal pockets in an unclear and unjustified manner, in addition to wages, bonuses, and legitimate business income.

In the past, some people thought that gray income was only the privilege of "speculators." Now it seems that this is not the case. In recent years, individual business households, enterprises, institutions, research departments, art troupes, schools, and many other places with economic income have followed suit, vying to increase personal additional income. Hiding income and evading national taxes are the main methods. For example, a certain unit changed 410,000 yuan of service income into bonuses distributed to employees; a certain design institute transferred consulting income into a small treasury and then secretly distributed it to all employees; some create various names to turn public funds into private gains; some, under the pretext of caring for employees' lives, increase various allowances indefinitely. As for individual business households that do not declare income, the situation is even worse. According to calculations in Beijing, just last year, the amount reached over 100 million yuan. As a result, in some places, some people's additional income is far more than their wages and bonuses. Of course, due to different fields, the amount of gray income also varies. Generally speaking, the circulation sector has more than the production sector; manual laborers have more than intellectual laborers; individual and private economies have more than collective and state-owned economies.

The spread of gray income has not been long, but its harm is becoming more and more apparent. One harm is that it makes consumption funds more difficult to control, exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction. More seriously, it causes social inequity in distribution. There are ways to plug the loopholes of gray income, such as leaders of various units putting the overall interests first and consciously not giving the green light to gray income; financial personnel performing their duties and strictly controlling financial matters; improving the tax collection and administration system, and strictly collecting personal income adjustment taxes. Things in the world are afraid of not being serious. As long as serious measures are taken to stop gray income and persistently implemented, this problem can be solved.

　　说“灰色收入”
　　路华
    据统计人员的调查，有些地方的企业职工和个体工商户收入增长很快：南京29家企业职工收入一年内增长40.6％（而劳动生产率仅提高6.6％）；张家口市去年一年收入超万元的增加150多人（原有300人）；北京市11万多个体户中，年收入逾万元的已近10％，年收入逾10万元的三四百户。
    这些人的收入为什么增加得这么快？确有许多捉摸不透的增收之谜，他们之中相当多的一部人增收的数量和办法甚为隐秘，有的甚至子不告父，妻不告夫，单位之间严密封锁；而且无凭无据，手续混乱不全；此种收入名目繁多，有钱有物，有现金有支票，随机而变，因时而易，他人难于看透。因此，有人赐给此种收入一个专号：灰色收入。灰色者，介于黑白之间也。灰色收入，即指工资、奖金和正当的营业收入外，不明不白流入个人腰包里的那部分不正常收入。
    过去，有人认为灰色收入仅是“倒爷们”的专利，现在看来不尽然。近年来，个体工商户、企业、机关、科研部门、文艺团体、学校等许多有经济收入的地方，纷纷效仿，竟相增加个人额外收入。隐瞒收入，偷漏国家税收，这是主要方式之一。如某单位把4.1万元劳务收入改以酬金形式分给职工；某设计所把咨询收入转入小金库后，又悄悄地分给了全体职工；有的巧立名目，化公为私；有的以关心职工生活为名，无限增加各种补贴。至于个体工商户中不申报收入者更甚，据北京市测算，仅去年一年就达亿元以上。这样一来，有些地方一些人的额外收入远远多于工资和奖金。当然，由于领域不同，灰色收入的多少也不同。大体说来，流通领域多于生产领域；体力劳动者多于脑力劳动者；个体和私营经济多于集体和全民经济。
    灰色收入之风蔓延时间不长，但它的危害越来越明显。危害之一，就是使消费基金更加难于控制，加剧了供需矛盾。更严重的是造成社会分配不公。堵塞灰色收入的漏洞，办法是有的，如各单位的领导以全局利益为重，自觉不为灰色收入开绿灯；财会人员履行职责，严格把住财务关；健全税收征管制度，严格查征个人收入调节税。世界上的事情就怕认真，只要认真采取措施制止灰色收入，并且持之以恒，这个问题是能够解决的。
