Currently, some sanitation departments face issues with an unstable workforce and a lack of successors. For instance, our bureau has over 800 employees, but only 300 are permanent or contract workers. The rest are temporary or casual workers. They constitute over 80% of the workforce in cleaning, waste removal, and waste disposal. Some temporary workers come and go as they please, which poses significant challenges for completing tasks, ensuring quality, and maintaining mechanical equipment. Many permanent and contract workers are also "jumping ship" and changing careers. Some veteran workers say, "The sanitation bureau has become a training ground for drivers for other units."

The causes of this situation are multifaceted:

	1. **Social Bias**: Sanitation work is labor-intensive, but few truly understand and support it. Although the Party and government care deeply about sanitation workers, many in society still look down on the job and are unwilling to do it.

	2. **Practical Problems**: Sanitation workers face difficulties in finding partners, securing housing, and converting family members' rural status to urban status. These issues deter many potential workers.

	3. **Low Wages and Benefits**: In the past, to encourage people to work in sanitation, relevant departments allowed those entering the field to be classified two to three levels higher than in other industries. Now, wages in other sectors are generally higher, with floating grades and various bonuses, far exceeding those of sanitation workers.

We hope that relevant departments will take measures to stabilize the sanitation workforce and promote the healthy development of the sanitation industry.

    环卫队伍不稳  后继无人堪忧
    目前，有些地方的环卫部门存在着队伍不稳，后继无人的状况。例如，我局有职工800多人，其中固定工、合同制工人只有300人，其余都是临时工、零散工。他们在清扫、清运、清掏工作第一线的比例，一般都在80％以上。有的临时工愿干就来，不愿干就走。这种状况对于工作任务的完成，质量的保证，机械设备的维护保养等，都带来了很大困难。不少固定工、合同制工人也纷纷“跳槽转业”。有的老工人说：“环卫局简直成了为外单位培养输送司机的学校。”造成这种情况的原因是多方面的：
    世俗的偏见。环卫工人工作辛苦，但真正理解、支持的人并不多。尽管党和政府十分关心环卫工人，社会上仍有不少人对环卫工作瞧不起，不愿干。
    一些实际问题难以解决。环卫工人找对象难，住房难，家属“农转非”难。使一些人望而却步。
    工资待遇不甚高。记得以前为鼓励人们到环卫部门工作，有关部门规定同年参加工作，在其它行业只能定二级工，在环卫部门可高出二至三级。如今，各行各业的工资标准几乎都比环卫工人高，还有浮动级和名目繁多的奖金，其收入远远超过环卫工人。
    希望有关部门采取措施，以保持环卫队伍的稳定，促进环卫事业的健康发展。
