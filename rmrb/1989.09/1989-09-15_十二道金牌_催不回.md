	“Twelve Imperial Edicts” Cannot Recall Him

	Mr. Hu Guozan, a native of Anxi, Fujian, is the chairman of the Hong Kong Qunying Trading Company. Over the past few years, he has established enterprises in Xiamen, Sanming, Shishi, and other places, with a registered capital of over 150 million yuan.

	Just as he was preparing to establish the Fujian Jinlong Real Estate Limited Company in Fuzhou, the June Fourth Incident occurred in Beijing. Some overseas media distorted the facts, causing unease in Hong Kong society. Mr. Hu's wife, worried in Hong Kong, repeatedly called to urge him to return. Mr. Hu told his wife, “Fuzhou is very calm, and I am very safe.” His wife was skeptical and sent two sons to bring him back. The sons arrived, but Mr. Hu not only did not return to Hong Kong but also left his eldest son to assist with the work. On June 19, the Fujian Jinlong Real Estate Limited Company (sole proprietorship) was officially established, and the first phase of the project, Jinlong New Village, with an investment of 24 million yuan, began construction. Since July, Mr. Hu has planned to invest 180 million yuan to build Jinlong Building and Jinlong Industrial Park. Mr. Hu said, “I believe that China's policy of opening up to the outside world will not change.”

　　“十二道金牌”催不回
    福建安溪籍的胡国赞先生是香港群英贸易公司董事长。几年来，他在厦门、三明、石狮等地兴办企业，注册资本1500多万元。
    正当他在福州筹办福建金龙地产有限公司之际，北京发生了暴乱。海外一些歪曲真相的舆论，使香港社会人心惶惶，胡先生的太太在香港放心不下，一再打电话催促他回港。胡先生告诉太太：“福州很平静，我很安全。”胡太太将信将疑，派两个儿子来接胡先生回去。孩子来了，胡先生不仅没回港，还把大儿子留下来协助工作。6月19日福建金龙地产有限公司（独资）正式成立，首期工程投资2400万元的金龙新村同时开工。7月份以来，胡先生计划投资1.8亿元，兴建金龙大厦和金龙工业小区。胡先生说：“我相信，中国实行对外开放不会改变。”
