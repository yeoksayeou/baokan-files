Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th.

By the end of August this year, 570.41 million citizens nationwide have received resident ID cards.

According to reports, the number of people who have received resident ID cards accounts for 74% of the total number of people who should receive them.

There are 370 cities and 1,037 county-level administrative units nationwide that have basically completed the task of issuing ID cards, and most of the other cities and counties have also started issuing ID cards.

The Ministry of Public Security held a press conference today to introduce the above situation.

It is understood that the people who have received resident ID cards are mainly distributed in large and medium-sized cities, along transportation routes, coastal open areas, special economic zones, tourist areas, border areas, and rural areas with relatively developed commodity economies.

Most of the regions that have basically completed the concentrated task of issuing ID cards have issued announcements from the government to start using and verifying resident ID cards in their regions. These situations provide conditions for the implementation of the use and verification system nationwide.
