Since 1983, China has taken a more active stance in the United Nations disarmament negotiations, proposing a series of fair, reasonable, and practical new suggestions.

In 1983, the Chinese delegation proposed at the United Nations General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union should first stop testing, improving, and producing nuclear weapons, and reach an agreement to reduce all types of nuclear weapons and delivery systems by 50%. Subsequently, an international conference should be held with the participation of all nuclear states. In 1985, the Chinese delegation proposed four points on disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly: First, all nuclear states, especially the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, should commit to not using nuclear weapons first under any circumstances and should unconditionally refrain from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states and nuclear-free zones. Second, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact should reach an agreement as soon as possible on significantly reducing conventional armaments. Third, the United States and the Soviet Union should immediately stop any form of space arms race, and any country with space capabilities should not develop, test, or deploy space weapons, and should promptly conclude an international agreement to comprehensively prohibit and destroy space weapons. Fourth, the Geneva Conference of the 40 States on Disarmament should complete its negotiating tasks as soon as possible and conclude a comprehensive convention to prohibit and thoroughly destroy chemical weapons. Before that, all countries with the capability to produce chemical weapons should stop testing, producing, transferring, and deploying chemical weapons, and ensure that they will never use such weapons.

At the same time, China has taken concrete actions to demonstrate its sincere attitude towards disarmament. China has stated that when nuclear disarmament progresses to a certain stage, it is willing to fulfill its nuclear disarmament obligations. China does not engage in nuclear proliferation and does not assist other countries in developing nuclear weapons. In June 1985, China decided to reduce its military personnel by 1 million within two years, and military expenditures were significantly reduced, in order to concentrate efforts on economic development and improve people's lives.

    为实现世界裁军作出新努力
    从1983年起，中国在联合国裁军谈判中，以更加积极的态度相继提出了一系列公平合理而又切实可行的新建议。
    1983年，中国代表团在联大提出建议，要求美苏率先停止试验、改进和生产核武器，并就削减一切类型的核武器和运载工具50％达成协议，此后召开包括所有核国家参加的国际会议。1985年，中国代表团在联大就裁军问题提出四点建议：一、所有核国家，特别是美苏两个核大国应承担义务，做到在任何情况下不首先使用核武器，并且无条件地不对无核国家和无核区使用或威胁使用核武器。二、北约和华约两个军事集团应就大幅度裁减常规军备问题早日达成协议。三、美苏两国应立即停止任何形式的外空军备竞赛，任何拥有空间能力的国家都不发展，不试验和不部署外空武器，并尽快缔结一项全面禁止和销毁外空武器的国际协议。四、要求日内瓦40国裁军谈判会议早日完成谈判任务，缔结一项全面禁止和彻底销毁化学武器公约。在此之前，所有具有制造化学武器能力的国家应停止试验、生产、转让和部署化学武器，并确保绝不使用这种武器。
    与此同时，中国采取实际行动表明自己对裁军的真诚态度。中国表示，当核裁军的进程发展到一定阶段时，中国愿意履行自己所应当承担的核裁军义务；中国不搞核扩散，不帮助其他国家发展核武器；1985年6月，中国作出了在两年内裁减军队总额100万人的决定，军费开支也大为压缩，以利于集中力量搞好经济建设，改善人民生活。
