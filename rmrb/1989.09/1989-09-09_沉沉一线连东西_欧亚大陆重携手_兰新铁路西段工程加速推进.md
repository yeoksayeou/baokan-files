The second major railway linking the Eurasian continent—the western section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway—is currently under rapid construction, extending westward at a pace of over one kilometer per day. It is anticipated that by the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the railway will have reached Jinhua, 384 kilometers from Urumqi. From there, it is only 76 kilometers to Alashankou, where it will connect with the Soviet railway.

Since the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was completed to Urumqi in late 1962, it has not been extended for over 20 years. To create an economic development pattern in Xinjiang that moves eastward and westward, with a focus on the west, in May 1985, the state and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region jointly invested in the continuation of the western section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The entire project is divided into two phases. The first phase, from Urumqi to Wusu, is 236 kilometers long. Construction began on May 1, 1985, and was completed in just two years and five months. It quickly began to handle part of the passenger and freight operations. On May 1, 1988, the second phase of construction began. Local governments and people along the route have provided strong support and cooperation, accelerating the construction of the railway.

On July 22, representatives from the railway construction departments of China and the Soviet Union held talks in Beijing and Urumqi regarding the connection of the western section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway with the Soviet railway and reached an agreement. This will accelerate the construction of the western section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and strive to complete the track laying to Alashankou by next October, connecting with the Soviet railway. Once this railway is completed, goods transported from Lianyungang, the starting point of the Longhai Railway in China, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands will be shortened by approximately 5,000 nautical miles compared to sea transport. This will play an important role in promoting the economic development of China, the Soviet Union, and neighboring regions.

    沉沉一线连东西　欧亚大陆重携手
    兰新铁路西段工程加速推进
    连接欧亚大陆的第二条铁路动脉——兰新铁路西段工程正加紧建设，每天以1公里多的速度向西延伸。预计到国庆40周年前夕，将铺轨到离乌鲁木齐384公里的西陲要地精河。从这里到阿拉山口与苏联铁路接轨，便只有76公里了。
    兰新铁路自1962年底通车到乌鲁木齐之后，20余年没有向前延修。为了在新疆形成东进西出、向西倾斜的经济发展格局，1985年5月，由国家和新疆维吾尔自治区共同投资续修兰新铁路西段。整个工程分为两个阶段进行。第一期工程乌鲁木齐至乌苏段共长236公里。1985年5月1日动工，仅用了2年零5个月就全部建成，并且很快就开始承担部分客货营运。1988年5月1日，第二期工程又开始兴建。沿线各地政府和人民，给予大力支持和配合，加快了铁路建设。
    7月22日，中苏两国铁路建设代表团先后在北京和乌鲁木齐就中国兰新铁路西段与苏联铁路接轨等问题进行了会谈，并达成了协议。这将加快兰新铁路西段建设步伐，力争明年10月铺轨到阿拉山口，与苏联铁路接轨。这条铁路建成后，由我国陇海路起点、东海之滨的连云港运货物到荷兰的鹿特丹，将比海上运距缩短约5000海里，对促进中苏两国及两国邻近地区经济的发展起到重要作用。　（范西斌）（附图片）
