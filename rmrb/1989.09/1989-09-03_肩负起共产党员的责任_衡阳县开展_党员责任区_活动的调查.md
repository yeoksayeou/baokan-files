The Hengyang County Committee in Hunan Province, in response to the weak and dispersed state of some grassroots party organizations and certain party members in rural areas, has been conducting the "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity in rural areas since last year. This activity has found an effective way to strengthen the party's construction in rural areas under the new situation and to fully play the vanguard and exemplary role of the broad masses of party members.

At the beginning of last year, Hengyang County conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into the role of rural party members, revealing that among the more than 20,000 rural party members in the county, approximately one-third were either not playing any role or were even playing a negative role. The main reasons for this were fivefold: First, some party members felt they had "no position and no power" and did not know how to play a role; second, some believed that "whether or not you are a party member, everyone has their own responsibility fields," feeling there was no place to play a role; third, some retired village and group cadres felt "freed from official duties, no need to worry about work," thinking they could rest now; fourth, some were blinded by money, focusing only on personal enrichment, forgetting their party member responsibilities; fifth, some party members were still impoverished themselves, feeling they had no right to guide and help the masses. These situations indicated that it was necessary to create a good environment for the broad masses of party members to play a role, so that they would always think of their responsibilities and voluntarily serve the people.

In response to the above situation, the Hengyang County Committee launched the "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity in all rural party branches starting in April last year. Over the past year, the county has established 3,980 "Party Member Responsibility Areas," with more than 90% of rural party members participating in this activity.

The "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity in Hengyang County generally takes natural villages as units, dividing a village into 3 to 5 responsibility areas, with each area having 3 to 7 party members, and one party member taking charge. The target tasks of the responsibility areas include propagating and implementing the party's line, principles, and policies, doing good ideological and political work among the masses, helping the poor and assisting the masses in developing commodity production, leading the masses in breaking old customs and establishing new ones, and voluntarily maintaining social and production order. The township and village party committees, in conjunction with local actual conditions, implement the above tasks item by item to the responsibility areas, with each party member signing a target responsibility book and implementing target management.

To ensure that the "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity is effectively carried out and sustained in the long term, the Hengyang County Committee has focused on three aspects of work:

First, attention has been paid to strengthening specific guidance. County, district, and township-level "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity guidance groups have been established, with deputy party committee secretaries serving as group leaders and relevant personnel from the organization, propaganda, and discipline inspection departments as members. Various forms such as training classes, organized visits and learning, watching videos, and conducting thematic discussions have been adopted to educate the broad masses of party members on the situation and policies, ideals and purposes, commodity production, and scientific and technological knowledge, broadening their horizons and enhancing their ability to carry out the "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity.

Second, regular assessment, reporting, public evaluation, and inspection and comparison systems have been carefully formulated. Township and village party committees regularly inspect each responsibility area once every quarter and conduct a comprehensive assessment every half year, publishing the assessment results to the public. The county committee conducts a spot check every half year on the implementation of the responsibility area activity in each township and a comprehensive inspection and comparison at the end of the year, commending the advanced and promptly solving problems to promote the in-depth development of the responsibility area activity.

Third, the activity's achievements have been linked to evaluations for excellence, promotions, and appointments. Since last year, the county committee has promoted and appointed more than 630 party members who have made significant contributions in the responsibility area activity, including 285 promoted to village cadres and 78 hired as township contract workers.

The "Party Member Responsibility Area" activity, which has been carried out for more than a year, has already shown initial results in promoting the construction of both material and spiritual civilizations and the party's own construction:

First, it has expanded the grassroots ideological and political work force, strengthened rural ideological and political work, and changed the situation where only a few cadres were relied upon and ideological and political work was weak. In May, during the soybean oil collection period, some villagers were unwilling to deliver the contracted soybean oil. In Aimin Village, Jiushi Township, four party members, including Peng Changyun, took the lead in completing the soybean oil contract purchase task and went door-to-door to do ideological work for the masses. As a result, the 29 households in this village completed the soybean oil contract purchase task a week ahead of schedule.

Due to the broad masses of party members taking the lead in everything and actively doing ideological and political work among the masses, last year the county's 190 million jin contracted grain purchase task was completed on time, civil disputes decreased by 38.4% compared to the previous year, and violations of family planning regulations also became less frequent.

Second, it has promoted the development of rural commodity economy and accelerated the pace of the masses becoming wealthy. In recent years, rural party members in this county have spread 9,870 economic information items to the masses, opened 6,970 wealth-creating paths, and 45% of the 4,300 impoverished households in the county have already become wealthy.

Third, it has stimulated the initiative to do good deeds and practical things, and has strengthened the relationship between the party and the masses. According to incomplete statistics, the broad masses of rural party members have done more than 3,700 good deeds and practical things for the masses over the past year, helping to solve more than 2,600 specific difficulties.

Fourth, it has improved the quality of the broad masses of party members and promoted the party's own construction. Last year, the county selected more than 1,100 advanced workers, 90% of whom were party members; it selected 2,290 "two civilizations" households and five-good families, and 9,100 rural science and technology demonstration households emerged, with party member households accounting for 82% and 88.4%, respectively.

    肩负起共产党员的责任
    ——衡阳县开展“党员责任区”活动的调查
    新华社记者　曹光晖
    湖南省衡阳县委针对一些农村基层党组织及部分党员软弱涣散的现状，从去年以来在农村开展了
  “党员责任区”活动，为新形势下切实加强农村党的建设、充分发挥广大党员的先锋模范作用找到了一条有效的途径。
    去年初，衡阳县对农村党员发挥作用的情况进行了一次全面、系统的调查，发现在全县2万多名农村党员中，基本上不发挥作用、甚至起消极作用的约占1／3。其原因主要有5种：一是有的党员认为自己“一无职，二无权”，不知怎样发挥作用；二是有的认为现在“不管党员不党员，各种各的责任田”，感到无处发挥作用；三是有些退下来的村组干部，觉得“无官一身轻，工作免操心”，认为现在可以歇歇脚了；四是有的钱迷心窍，只顾埋头个人发财致富，把党员的责任丢到九霄云外；五是有的党员本身还是个贫困户，认为自己没有资格去指导和帮助群众。这些情况表明：必须为广大党员创造一个发挥作用的良好环境，使他们时刻想到自己的责任，自觉地为人民服务。
    针对上述情况，衡阳县委从去年4月起，在全县农村党支部广泛开展“党员责任区”活动。一年多来，这个县建立“党员责任区”3980多个，参加这一活动的党员占农村党员总数的90％以上。
    衡阳县开展的“党员责任区”活动，一般以自然村为单位，把一个村划为3至5个责任区，每个责任区有3至7名党员，并由一名党员负责。责任区的目标任务有宣传贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，做好群众的思想政治工作；扶贫帮困，指导和帮助群众发展商品生产；带动群众破旧俗、树新风，自觉维护社会秩序和生产秩序等。各乡镇党委和村党支部结合当地的实际情况，将上述任务逐项落实到责任区，每个党员签订目标责任书，实行目标管理。
    为了保证“党员责任区”活动有效地开展起来，并且长期坚持下去，衡阳县委狠抓了3个方面的工作：
    首先，注意加强具体指导。县、区、乡都成立了“党员责任区”活动指导小组，各级党委副书记任组长，组织、宣传、纪检等部门的有关同志为成员，采取举办培训班、组织参观学习、收看录像、开展专题讨论等多种形式，对广大党员进行形势政策、理想宗旨、商品生产和科学技术知识等方面的教育，使大家开阔了视野，增强开展“党员责任区”活动的本领。
    其次，认真制订定期考核、汇报、群众评议和检查评比等制度。乡镇党委和村党支部对各责任区坚持每季度进行一次抽查，每半年进行一次全面考核，并将考核结果公布于众。县委坚持每半年对各乡镇责任区活动的开展情况进行一次抽查，年终进行一次全面的检查评比，表彰先进，发现问题及时解决，促进责任区活动深入开展。
    第三，把活动实绩同评优创先、提拔使用等挂起钩来。去年以来，县委提拔使用了630多名在责任区活动中有较大贡献的党员，其中提拔为村干部的有285人，录用为乡镇合同制干部的有78人。
      “党员责任区”活动开展一年多以来，在促进两个文明建设和党的自身建设等方面，已经初见成效：
    一、扩大了基层思想政治工作队伍，加强了农村思想政治工作，改变了只靠少数几个干部、思想政治工作薄弱的状况。今年5月菜油入库期间，有些村民不肯将定购菜油入库。九市乡爱民村谢石塘责任区彭年春等4名党员带头完成菜油定购任务，上门做群众的思想工作。结果这个村民小组29户的菜油定购任务提前一周全部完成。
    由于广大党员遇事带头，又积极做群众的思想政治工作，去年全县1.9亿公斤合同定购粮任务全部按期交清，民事纠纷比上年下降38.4％，违反计划生育的现象也越来越少。
    二、促进了农村商品经济的发展，加快了群众致富的步伐。近年来，这个县的农村党员共为群众传播经济信息9870多条，开辟致富门路6970多项，全县4300多个贫困户已有45％脱贫致富。
    三、激发了办好事、实事的积极性，密切了党群关系。据不完全统计，广大农村党员一年来共为群众办好事、实事3700多件，帮助解决具体困难2600多起。
    四、提高了广大党员的素质，推动了党的自身建设。去年，全县共评选出先进工作者1100多人，其中党员占90％；评出“双文明”户和五好家庭2290多户，涌现出农村科技示范户9100多户，其中党员户分别占82％和88.4％。　（新华社供本报专稿）
