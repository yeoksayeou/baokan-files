The length of the West Ring Road in Gong County, Henan Province, is less than 1,000 meters, but garbage occupies two-thirds of the road surface, seriously obstructing traffic. The northern section has a pile of garbage measuring over 60 cubic meters, which has reportedly not been cleaned for more than five years. The entire street is filled with a foul odor, and pedestrians all cover their noses as they pass by. Inside the county town, there is a designated "garbage dumping area" on Xinxing Road. The ash from nearby restaurants, household garbage, and residents' waste are all dumped here. Some children even use the garbage pile as a toilet. The other two main roads in the county town also have piles of garbage.

    满街臭味行人掩鼻过
    巩县县城垃圾无人管
    河南巩县环城西路总长度不到1000米，但是垃圾占了路面的2／3，严重阻碍了交通；路北段有一堆60多立方米的垃圾，据反映已有5年多没有清理了，整条街道充满着恶臭，行人无不掩鼻而过。县城内的新兴路有一处被作为“垃圾堆放地”，附近饭店的炉渣、垃圾、居民们的生活废料都倾倒在这里，有些小孩还在垃圾堆上大小便。县城内的其它两条公路上，也都堆有垃圾。
