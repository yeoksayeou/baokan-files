The old Beijingers watch as their city gradually becomes more crowded. They don't know where all these people come from, filling up Wangfujing, Xidan, Dongdan, Qianmen, and Dazhalan until they are packed tight. Beijingers love peace and quiet, so they don't join in the commotion. Those places are full of outsiders, people who come to Beijing to see the sights, do business, and the young maids from the countryside. If you bypass those bustling areas and venture into a few narrow alleys, enter a courtyard, you'll see some Beijingers strolling with their hands behind their backs, or a family enjoying the cool under the awning, shelling sunflower seeds.

You might even recognize one of them. He's the most leisurely among his group, rising early every day to take his birdcage to the park, and in the afternoon, occasionally gathering a few friends to sing a few lines of "Empty City Strategy" for their own amusement. He says, "The secret to a long life is to live comfortably." So, he's healthier than those who spend all day practicing tai chi in the park. They seem to have completely forgotten the past, and it's only when he picks up a chess piece and shouts "Checkmate!" while slamming the piece down on the board that you can sense a bit of the vigor he had in his youth. He often says, "Don't mention those years, don't mention them. Now, aren't we living just fine? My wife passed away, but now I'm even more at ease." After saying this, he always turns away.

Later, their neighborhood was slated for demolition, and he refused to move out, but in the end, he had to. He moved all the way to a high-rise outside the Third Ring Road. Now, the only thing he can do is sit on the balcony and count the cars passing by on the road. He also knocked on his neighbor's door, but the one who opened it was a newlywed couple.

He passed away later, and people found a pile of awards he had received under his pillow.

In another alley, the difference from other alleys in Beijing is probably that there's a newspaper stand at the entrance. The vendor is a man in his late forties. In Chinese terms, he is already considered an elderly person. The newspaper stand doesn't do much business, but every day, a tall man of the same age comes to buy a copy of the *Beijing Evening News* and always sits down to chat with the vendor.

Beijing was built by them, and Beijing cherishes the past.

A few clever young men opened a teahouse in a bustling area, modeled after the one described in Lao She's *Teahouse*. The young men learned a trick: holding a large copper teapot in one hand, they tilt the pot slightly, and a thin stream of tea shoots out, straight into the small teacup held in the other hand. Customers like to come here, sip a cup of strong tea, have a few bites of the pea pancakes and steamed buns that Empress Dowager Cixi used to eat, discuss the latest play by the "Beijing People's Art Theatre," and call out to the shop assistants. It seems that they are not just enjoying themselves but also reminiscing about the past. The business is booming. The leader of the young men says, "We are looking for that old Beijing flavor."

Go and see Tiananmen Square and Dazhalan, and you might often see such scenes. One day, a young woman escorted her elderly father out of the Forbidden City. They walked through Tiananmen to the square, past the Monument to the People's Heroes, past Chairman Mao's Mausoleum, and arrived at the newly opened KFC. Seeing the long line of people waiting, the elderly man shook his head. "No, no," the young woman pleaded. The elderly man sighed, and then the old and the young stood at the end of the line. Old Beijing is changing, and so are the old Beijingers.

　　老北京人
　　陈新
    老北京的人看着北京城慢慢地变得拥挤了。也不知哪来的那么多人，把王府井、西单、东单、前门、大栅栏挤得水泄不通。北京人爱清静，不去凑这个热闹。那儿净是些外地人，是来北京见世面，来北京做生意的，还有那些乡下来的小保姆。如果你绕过那些热闹的地方，去钻几个小胡同，走进一家四合院，你就会看到一些背着手踱着步的北京人，看到一家子在院里的凉棚下嗑着瓜子纳凉的北京人。
    你也许还会认识他。他是他们那伙儿中最悠闲的一个，每天早早地起来，托着鸟笼去公园遛遛鸟，下午还时不时地拉上几个票友，聚在一块儿唱几句《空城计》，以求自娱。他说：“养生之道，就是活得舒坦。”于是他比那些整天在公园里打太极拳的人硬朗。他们似乎已完全忘了过去，也似乎只有在棋桌上，当他拿起一个棋子，一声“将军”，而后把棋子往棋盘上重重一拍，才能觉出点青年时所有的那种气概。他常说：“不提那些年了，不提了，如今，不是活得好好的吗？老伴去世了，可活得更自在。”说完他总是背过身去。
    后来，他们那片要拆了，他死活不愿意搬出去，可结果还是搬了。一直搬到三环路以外的高楼里。如今他唯一可做的事就是坐在阳台上数着马路上来往的汽车。他也去敲过邻居家的门，可开门的是一对新婚夫妇。
    他后来死了，人们从他枕头底下翻出一大摞当年他得的奖状。
    在另一个胡同里，跟北京城里其他胡同的差别大概就在于胡同口有一个报摊。摊主是个近五十的人。在中国人看来，他已步入老年人行列了。报摊生意清淡，但每天总有个和摊主同样年纪的大高个来买一张《北京晚报》，也总是坐下两人聊聊。
    北京城是他们建的，北京城在留恋着过去。
    有几个聪明的小伙子，在挺繁华的地带依照老舍《茶馆》里描写的那个样子办起了茶馆。小伙子们学会一绝，一手握着那个硕大无比的铜壶的把，把壶轻轻一斜，壶嘴便喷出一条细线，直射进另一只手里拿着的那个小茶杯里。客人们喜欢到这里来，喝上一杯浓浓的香茶，吃上几口以前慈禧吃过的豌豆黄、小窝头，谈谈
  “北京人艺”新演的戏，吆喝几声店小二，似乎这一切不仅仅是在享受，好像是在追忆一切。小店生意兴隆。小伙子们的头头说：“我们就是要去寻找那种老北京的味儿。”
    再去看看天安门广场、前门大栅栏，也许你也常常会看到这样的事。有一天，一个姑娘搀扶着她年长的父亲，游览完故宫出来。穿过天安门来到广场，走过纪念碑，走过毛主席纪念堂，来到新开张的肯塔基炸鸡店前。看着排着长队等待的人群，老者摇头了。“不嘛，不嘛。”姑娘撒着娇。老者叹了口气，于是一老一少就站在了队伍的末尾。老北京正在变，老北京人也会变的。
