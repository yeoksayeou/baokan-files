Guo Jiyan's "The Theory of Socialist Economic Development" (published by Jiangsu People's Publishing House) is divided into four parts, excluding the introduction: equilibrium theory, level theory, power theory, and regulation theory. This theoretical structure aims to study the operation process of the national economy as a whole that has its own laws of motion and is regulated by "production participants."

Maintaining various equilibrium relationships within the national economy is the foundation and prerequisite for its smooth development. Therefore, the analysis of the equilibrium relationships of the national economy becomes the starting point of the study. However, no matter how complex and important the national economic equilibrium problem is, its significance in the development of the national economy lies only in this. The level of economic development and prosperity of a country is ultimately determined by the level of social productive forces. Achieving the Four Modernizations is the strategic goal of China's economic development. The so-called "modernization" is to make China's social productive forces reach the advanced level of the world. Moreover, the improvement of the level of social productive forces is also an important factor in determining the equilibrium relationship of the national economy in a certain period. Therefore, "The Theory of Development" studies the improvement of the level of social productive forces as an important aspect of developing socialist economy and focuses on the analysis of the optimization of industrial structure. Only by timely adjusting the industrial structure and establishing industrial departments that can absorb contemporary advanced science and technology can we use technologically advanced machinery and equipment to transform the backward state of the entire social production. Maintaining the equilibrium relationship of the national economy and improving the level of social productive forces are both objective requirements for the development of social material production. However, the development of social material production must be promoted through the active subject of man. Economic activities are actually the activities of various "production participants." Therefore, mobilizing and giving full play to the vitality of "production participants" becomes the key to the development of the national economy. It can be said that incorporating the mechanism of power into the research field of economic development theory is an attempt by the author. The above three aspects are all studies of the objective laws of socialist economy. On this basis, the author studies the macro-control activities of the state in the chapter on "regulation theory."

Treating the socialist national economy as a whole and studying the equilibrium relationship of the national economy, the level of social productive forces, the power of economic development, and the macro-control activities of the state in sequence according to their internal connections in the operation process can also be said to be a method of analysis from the abstract to the concrete, although it is not yet perfect, but it is not a bad method for studying the problem of socialist economic development.

Another feature of "The Theory of Development" is to re-examine some traditional theories and honestly express different opinions on some important views in the academic community. In the "Introduction," the author specially devotes a chapter to comment on the exploration and debates on the problem of socialist economic development by numerous Marxists since the October Revolution, from which many thought-provoking questions are derived. In the subsequent chapters, there are reflections and analyses on the recognition of predecessors and current debates. For a long time, there have been two approaches in the study of the national economic equilibrium problem in China's academic community: one is guided by Marx's reproduction theory, and the other is based on Western macroeconomic theory. The author disagrees with the latter approach and, for this reason, analyzes in detail the relevant theories in Samuelson's "Economics" and proposes different opinions on the views of some domestic scholars. For the former approach, the author also puts forward his own views.

Combining the study of the economic operation process, the analysis of the actual situation of the national economy, and the historical tracing and investigation, and using a large number of literature materials as evidence, is also the place where the book is worth reading. For example, in the study of the problem of improving the level of social productive forces, the historical process of the evolution of the industrial structure of capitalist countries since the Industrial Revolution, especially after World War II, is analyzed, and on this basis, the general laws of the continuous optimization of the industrial structure, the important role of national industrial policy, and the ways to improve China's industrial structure are discussed. The author proposes that the current trend of industrial structure evolution is from the "three-legged" pattern of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry to diversification, and the production of means of production is developing towards high technology and fine division of labor. For example, in the study of the economic regulation activities of the state, the channels of regulation, the means of regulation, and the problem of how to combine structural regulation and total quantity regulation are specifically analyzed; in the study of the power mechanism of economic development, the realistic problems of China's economic system reform are analyzed in detail.

　　《社会主义经济发展论》评介
　　唐丰义
    郭继严著《社会主义经济发展论》（江苏人民出版社出版），除导论之外分为四篇：均衡论、水平论、动力论、调节论。这样的理论结构意在把国民经济作为既具有自身的运动规律又受“生产当事人”调节的运动整体，分层次研究其运行过程和制约其发展的基本因素。
    保持国民经济内部的多种均衡关系是它得以顺利发展的基础和前提，因此，国民经济均衡关系的分析成为研究的起点。但是，不管国民经济均衡问题多么复杂，多么重要，它在国民经济发展中的意义也只在于此。一个国家的经济发展程度、富裕程度，最终决定于社会生产力水平的高低。实现四个现代化是我国经济发展的战略目标，所谓“现代化”就是使我国社会生产力达到世界先进水平。而且社会生产力水平的提高还是决定某一时期国民经济均衡关系的重要因素。因此，《发展论》把提高社会生产力水平作为发展社会主义经济的一个重要方面加以研究，并且着重分析了优化产业结构问题。因为只有及时调整产业结构，建立起能吸收当代先进科学技术的产业部门，才能用技术先进的机器设备改造整个社会生产的落后状况。保持国民经济的均衡关系和提高社会生产力水平均属社会物质生产发展的客观要求。而社会物质生产的发展总要通过人这个能动主体去推动，经济活动实际上是各种“生产当事人”的活动。因此调动和发挥“生产当事人”的活力就成为发展国民经济的关键所在。可以说，把动力机制问题纳入经济发展理论的研究领域是作者的一个新的尝试。上述三个方面都是对社会主义经济客观规律的研究，在此基础上，作者在“调节论”一篇中，研究了国家的宏观调节活动。
    把社会主义国民经济作为一个整体，按照其运行过程的内在联系，依次研究国民经济的均衡关系、社会生产力水平、经济发展动力、国家的宏观调节活动，也可以说是从抽象上升到具体的分析方法，虽尚有不周密之处，但不失为一种研究社会主义经济发展问题的新方法。
    对一些传统理论进行再认识、对学术界一些重要观点坦诚地表明自己的不同见解，这是
  《发展论》一书的又一特点。作者在“导论”中专辟一章评论了十月革命以来众多马克思主义者对社会主义经济发展问题所进行的探索和争论，从中引出了不少发人深思的问题。在以后各篇中都有对前人认识和当前争论的反思和辨析。长期以来，我国学术界在国民经济均衡问题研究中存在着两种思路：一是以马克思的再生产理论为指导，一是以西方宏观经济理论为依据。作者不同意后一种思路，为此较详细地分析了萨缪尔逊《经济学》一书中的有关理论，对国内一些学者的观点提出了商榷意见。对前一种思路，也提出了自己的看法。
    把经济运行过程的研究、国民经济现实状况的分析以及历史的追踪考察紧密结合在一起，并以大量的文献资料为佐证，也是该书耐读之处。例如，在研究提高社会生产力水平问题时分析了自产业革命以来，特别是二战以后，资本主义国家产业结构演变的历史过程，并在此基础上论述了产业结构不断优化的一般规律，国家产业政策的重要作用，以及改善我国产业结构的途径。作者提出，当前产业结构的演变趋势是，由农轻重“三足鼎立”的格局向多元化发展，生产资料生产向高技术、细分工发展。再如，在研究国家的经济调节活动时，具体地分析了调节的渠道、调节的手段，以及如何把结构调节和总量调节结合起来的问题；在研究经济发展的动力机制时，较具体地分析了我国经济体制改革的现实问题。
