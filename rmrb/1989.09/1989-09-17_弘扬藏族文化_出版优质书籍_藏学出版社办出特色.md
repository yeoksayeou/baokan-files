The Tibetology Publishing House focuses on academic disciplines, editing and publishing a series of high-quality academic monographs and historical works, attracting attention from both domestic and international Tibetan studies communities.

Tibetology is a comprehensive discipline that studies the history and culture of the Tibetan people, covering areas such as religion, culture, philosophy, astronomy, calendar calculations, and folk customs. Currently, there are more than 20 countries and 3,000 people worldwide engaged in Tibetan studies.

To promote Tibetan culture, advance the development of Tibetan studies in China, and strengthen international exchanges, the Tibetology Publishing House has, over the past two years, overcome difficulties such as insufficient personnel and limited funds, and has been publishing books while still in the process of establishment. To date, it has published a total of 28 books, with a circulation of over 100,000 copies.

Emphasizing the completeness and serial nature of academic disciplines is one of the hallmarks of this publishing house. It has already published works such as the "Selected Works of the Five Sciences (Tibetan Edition)," which comprehensively reflects traditional Tibetan culture; the "Selected Works of Foreign Tibetan Studies (Translated into Chinese)," featuring works by foreign Tibetan scholars; and the "Collection of Tibetan Archival Materials (Tibetan and Chinese Editions)," among others.

Another distinctive feature of this publishing house is its focus on high-quality selections. Tibet has multiple Buddhist history monographs, and after careful comparison, they published the "Buddhist History by Bu-ston," which is the first Buddhist history monograph in Tibet. The initial print run of 6,000 copies is still in high demand.

This publishing house also pays great attention to reflecting the latest research findings in Tibetan studies.

　　弘扬藏族文化　出版优质书籍
　　藏学出版社办出特色
    本报讯　记者廖玒、刘晓林报道：中国藏学出版社注重学科特色，编辑出版了一批高档次学术专著、史籍，受到国内外藏学界注目。
    藏学是研究藏族社会历史和文化的综合学科，涉及宗教、文化、哲学、天文历算、民情民俗等各个领域。目前，世界上有20多个国家、3000多人从事藏学研究。
    为弘扬藏族文化，推动我国藏学研究的发展，加强国际交流，中国藏学出版社成立两年多以来，克服人员不足、经费紧缺的困难，边筹建边出书。到目前，累计出书28种，发行10万余册。
    注重学科完整性、系列性是该社的一个特色。已陆续出版的有集中反映藏族传统文化的《五明精选丛书（藏文版）》；国外藏学家专著精选《汉译国外藏学名著丛书》，以及《藏族档案史料丛编（藏、汉文版）》等。
    选题注重高档次是该社的另一个特色。西藏有多种佛教史专著，他们经过反复比较出版的《布敦佛教史》，是西藏第一部佛教史专著，初版6000册，仍供不应求。
    这个出版社还十分注意反映藏学的最新科研成果。
