To the Editor:

I received a civil judgment from the court. The most obvious discrepancies between the content and the facts are two: first, my age is 48, but the judgment states I am 45; second, Feng Youming is my grandfather, but the judgment states he is my father. I would like to ask: does such a judgment take effect?

Feng Lian Shan:

Regarding the question you raised in your letter, we respond as follows:

A judgment is an important legal document formed when a people's court makes a judgment. It is an important symbol of the people's court exercising judicial power on behalf of the state, a concentrated embodiment of the judicial function of the people's court, that is, the embodiment of the state's will; it is a vivid teaching material for legal propaganda and education. At the same time, the judgment facilitates the parties to the lawsuit in understanding the court's decision on the case, which is beneficial for execution; it also facilitates the higher court and the procuratorial organs to exercise judicial supervision. Therefore, the judgments made by the people's court, whether civil judgments, rulings, mediation statements, or criminal judgments, must be serious and rigorous. They must be accurate and error-free not only in the determination of facts and the application of law but also in the text, even down to a single punctuation mark. The age and identity of the parties involved in the case must be accurate because they often directly relate to the facts of the case or the determination of the nature of the case. For example, in a criminal judgment, the age of a person under 18 who commits a crime is crucial. For instance, a person who is one day short of being 18 years old and commits a crime punishable by death, considering the specific circumstances of the youth, our country's law stipulates that the death penalty is not applicable to such criminal offenders. Of course, in some cases, the determination of the facts and nature of the case has little to do with the age and identity of the parties.

Currently, some judgments made by the people's courts are indeed not rigorous. For example, as you mentioned in your letter, in a civil judgment, the age of a party is written as 45 instead of 48, and the name of your grandfather is mistakenly written as your father's name. These are all very unprofessional. When the parties receive such a judgment, they should point out the errors to the court and have them corrected in a timely manner. However, such errors are not errors in the determination of facts, the application of law, and the judgment result, and they do not affect the protection of the parties' legal rights and interests. Therefore, such a judgment should be considered legally effective, and it should not be refused to execute the court's judgment just because there are non-principal errors in the judgment. If such errors directly affect the determination of the facts and nature of the case, then it is another matter.

In summary, the judgments made by the people's court must be serious and rigorous, and there should be no principal errors, nor should there be non-principal errors. Only in this way can the seriousness of the state's law be fully and accurately reflected.

### 判决书中出现当事人年龄、身份差错还生效吗？

    判决书中出现当事人年龄、身份差错还生效吗？
    编辑同志：
    我收到一份法院的民事判决书，其中内容与事实不符的地方最明显的有两处：第一，我的年龄是48岁，而判决书却认定我是45岁；第二，冯有名是我的爷爷，而判决书却认定是我的父亲。请问：这样的判决书生效吗？
    河北玉田县陈家甫乡广播站　冯连山冯连山同志：
    现就你来信所提的问题答复如下：
    判决书是人民法院作出判决时所形成的重要法律文书。它是人民法院代表国家行使审判权的重要标志，是人民法院审判职能的集中体现，即国家意志的体现；是进行法制宣传教育的生动教材。同时，判决书便于诉讼当事人了解法院对案件处理的决定，以利于执行；便于上级法院和检察机关实行审判监督。因此，人民法院制作的判决书，不论是民事判决书、裁定书、调解书还是刑事判决书，都必须认真、严谨，不仅在认定事实上、适用法律上要准确无误，而且在文字上，哪怕是一个标点符号，都要绝对正确。法律文书中涉及到案件当事人的年龄、身份，必须准确，因为它往往直接关系到案件的事实或对案件性质的认定。如刑事判决书中不满18周岁的人犯罪，这个年龄就至关重要。比如一个差一天年满18周岁的人犯应判处死刑的刑罚，考虑到青少年这一具体情况，我国法律规定，对此类人犯罪不适用死刑。当然，有的案件的事实和性质的认定，与当事人的年龄和身份关系不大。
    现在有些人民法院制作的判决书，确有不严谨之处。像你来信所说，在一份民事判决书中，将当事人的年龄48岁写成45岁，将你爷爷的姓名错成你父亲的姓名，这都是极不严肃的。对这样的差错，当事人在接到判决书后，应向法院提出，让其及时改正。但是，类似这样的差错，并非认定事实、适用法律和判决结果方面的差错，也不影响当事人合法权益的保护。因此，这样的判决书，应当认为是具有法律效力的，不应因判决书中有非原则性的差错，而拒不执行人民法院的判决。如果这样的差错，直接影响到对案件事实和性质的认定，那自另当别论。
    总之，人民法院制作的判决书，必须严肃认真，原则性差错不应有，非原则性差错亦不应有。只有这样，才能完全准确地体现出国家法律的严肃性。
