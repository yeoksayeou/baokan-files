Li Ruihuan, during a discussion with propaganda and publishing department heads from various regions, emphasized the need for effective rectification and compression of newspapers and publishers. He also stressed the importance of integrating these efforts with development and construction to promote the prosperity of the news and publishing industry.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th: Today, Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, held a discussion in Zhongnanhai with representatives attending a national conference on rectifying and compressing newspapers and publishers, organized by the Publicity Department and the Press and Publication Administration. He pointed out that rectifying and compressing newspapers and publishers is an important part of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. The attitude must be firm, and results must be achieved. At the same time, rectification and compression must be integrated with construction and development to promote the prosperity of the news and publishing industry.

Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a State Councilor, also attended today's discussion. Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Publicity Department, presided over the meeting.

At the beginning of the meeting, Song Muwen, Director of the Press and Publication Administration, reported on the implementation and deployment of the work to rectify and compress newspapers and publishers. He said that the current focus is on solving two main issues. The first category is to firmly rectify and compress publications that propagate bourgeois liberalization, have serious political errors, and promote obscenity, violence, and feudal superstitions, and revoke the business licenses of the publishing units. The second category is to address the issue of newspapers and publishers developing too rapidly and excessively, leading to an overabundance of publications.

During the discussion, the heads of propaganda and news publishing departments from Jiangsu, Henan, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan spoke in turn.

Li Tieying pointed out at the meeting that the rectification and cleanup of the cultural market should be seen as a struggle against bourgeois infiltration and counter-infiltration, transformation and counter-transformation, and corruption and anti-corruption. Strengthening the management of the cultural market must be a long-term important task for party and government departments at all levels. This position must not be lost. The current focus is on rectifying the existing newspapers and publishers, strengthening management, and not expanding new ventures.

Li Ruihuan said that over the past decade of reform and opening up, the news and publishing front, like other fronts, has achieved significant results. Many comrades have done a lot of work in propagating the party's policies and enriching people's cultural lives, which should be fully affirmed. At the same time, it must be recognized that in recent years, many publications have openly opposed the four cardinal principles and harmed young people, and it is time to address this issue.

Li Ruihuan pointed out that the attitude towards rectifying and compressing newspapers and publishers must be firm. The size of the leaders' resolve is the key to the success or failure of this work. Those newspapers and publishers that need to be cut or compressed must be cut or compressed. If there are people who intervene, they must be firmly resisted and not shown any leniency. Great efforts must be made to rectify the news and publishing teams, especially the leadership teams of news and publishing units. Editorial and journalistic staff must be organized to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought seriously to improve the theoretical level of the news and publishing teams. Of course, the handling of personnel must be cautious.

Li Ruihuan emphasized that the rectification and compression of newspapers and publishers must be integrated with the construction and development of the news and publishing industry to make it more prosperous, rather than making it cold and desolate. The economic policies related to the publishing industry must be adjusted. It must be clear what to encourage and promote. Economic measures must be used to encourage and support healthy and beneficial publications.

Relevant department heads Gao Di, Zhu Muzi, Zhou Keyu, and heads of propaganda and news publishing departments from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and planned single-list cities attended the discussion.

    李瑞环同各地宣传出版部门负责人座谈时强调
    整顿压缩报刊和出版社务求见效
    并同建设发展相统一促进新闻出版业繁荣
    据新华社北京9月20日电　中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天上午在中南海同出席由中宣部、新闻出版署召开的全国整顿压缩报刊和出版社会议的代表座谈时指出，整顿压缩报刊和出版社，是反对资产阶级自由化斗争的重要组成部分，要态度坚决，抓出成效，同时，要把整顿压缩同建设发展统一起来，促进新闻出版事业的繁荣。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映，也出席了今天的座谈会。中宣部部长王忍之主持了座谈会。
    会议开始时，新闻出版署署长宋木文就这次会议落实部署整顿、压缩报刊和出版社的工作作了汇报。他说，当前整顿压缩报刊和出版社，主要是解决突出的两类问题。第一类，是对于宣扬资产阶级自由化、有严重政治错误的，以及宣扬淫秽色情、凶杀暴力、封建迷信的出版物，必须坚决整顿压缩，吊销其出版单位的营业执照。第二类，是解决报刊和出版社发展过急过快，出版物过多过滥的问题。
    座谈会上，江苏、河南、黑龙江、四川的宣传、新闻出版部门的负责人先后发言。
    李铁映在会上指出，要把这次整顿清理文化市场，提到同资产阶级进行渗透与反渗透，演变与反演变，腐蚀与反腐蚀的高度来认识。加强对文化市场管理，必须作为各级党政部门的一项长期的重要任务，这个阵地决不能丢。当前重要的是把现有的报刊和出版社整顿好，加强管理，而不是铺新摊子。
    李瑞环说，改革开放10年来，新闻出版战线同其它战线一样，取得了很大成绩。许多同志为宣传党的方针政策，丰富人民文化生活，做了大量工作，这一点应当充分肯定。同时也必须看到，这些年确实出了不少公开反对四项基本原则，毒害青少年的有害书刊，已经到了非解决不可的时候了。
    李瑞环指出，整顿压缩报刊和出版社，态度一定要坚决。领导者决心的大小，是这项工作成败的关键。对要砍、要压的书刊和出版社，必须砍掉、压掉。有出来说情的，要坚决顶住，决不手软。必须下大力气整顿好新闻出版队伍，特别是新闻出版单位的领导班子。要组织编辑、记者认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，提高新闻出版队伍的理论素养。当然，对人的处理要慎重。
    李瑞环强调，要把对报刊和出版社的整顿压缩同促进新闻出版事业的建设发展统一起来，使之更加繁荣，而不要搞得冷冷清清。有关出版业的经济政策要进行调整，鼓励什么，提倡什么，必须明确。要运用经济手段鼓励、扶持健康有益的出版物。
    有关方面负责人高狄、朱穆之、周克玉以及各省、自治区、直辖市、计划单列市的宣传、新闻出版部门的负责人，出席了座谈会。
