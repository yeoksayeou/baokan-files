U.S. and Soviet Foreign Ministers Announce Summit Meeting for Next Year
Soviet Foreign Minister Announces New Proposals on U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Treaty

	BEIJING, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze concluded their two-day talks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, today. At a press conference, they announced that the leaders of the two countries will hold their first summit meeting after Bush's inauguration in Washington in late spring or early summer of 1990. President Bush also announced the summit meeting from his vacation home in Maine.

	After two days of talks, the two foreign ministers reached seven principles of agreement on arms control and other issues, including measures for trial inspections of strategic weapons, advance notification of strategic military exercises, detailed outlines for monitoring underground nuclear tests, and a memorandum of understanding on inspections of chemical weapons. The two foreign ministers also discussed regional conflicts, human rights issues, and other international problems.

	Both foreign ministers expressed satisfaction with the progress made during their talks, stating that these developments "have opened a new phase of closer cooperation between the two countries."

	BEIJING, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze announced a new proposal on the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Treaty at a press conference in Jackson Hole today. Shevardnadze said this is a major concession by the Soviet Union, which will create a very realistic prospect for the early signing of a U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

	According to Shevardnadze's explanation, the key points of the Soviet Union's new proposal are as follows: Even if the agreement on space weapons between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has not been completed, the Soviet Union is willing to reach an agreement with the U.S. on the reduction of strategic weapons. However, both sides must continue to adhere to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and interpret the treaty strictly. If one side violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the other side can abolish the Strategic Arms Treaty. The Soviet Union will agree to conduct certain experiments and tests in space, but the U.S. and the Soviet Union should discuss such experiments and tests. The Soviet Union will also agree to dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar station.

	Secretary of State Baker said that the Soviet Union's above-mentioned proposal is a "positive step" and may open up new prospects for reaching a U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

    美苏外长会谈结束时宣布
    美苏首脑将于明年会晤
    苏外长宣布对苏美战略武器条约的新主张
    本报华盛顿9月23日电　记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在美国怀俄明州的“杰克逊霍尔”结束了两天的会谈，并在他们举行的记者招待会上宣布，双方同意美苏首脑于1990年春末或夏初在华盛顿举行布什总统上任后的第一次最高级会晤。布什总统在他缅因州的休假地也向记者宣布了美苏首脑会晤的消息。
    经过两天会谈，两国外长还达成了7项有关军备控制和其他方面的原则协议，包括对两国战略武器进行试验性核查的措施，提前两周通报对方有关战略军事演习的情报。关于监视地下核试验的详细概要，以及有关核查化学武器的谅解备忘录。两国外长还讨论了地区冲突、人权问题和其他国际性问题。
    两国外长对他们会谈中取得的进展表示满意，宣称这些进展“开辟了两国间进行更密切合作的新阶段”。
    本报华盛顿9月23日电　记者张启昕报道：苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在“杰克逊霍尔”举行的记者招待会上宣布了一项有关苏美战略武器条约方面的新主张。谢瓦尔德纳泽说，这是苏联作出的重大让步，将为早日签订一项美苏削减战略武器条约“创造非常现实的前景”。
    根据谢瓦尔德纳泽的说明，苏联这项新主张的要点是，即使在美苏有关太空武器的协定还未完成时，苏联也将准备同美国达成一项削减战略武器的条约，但双方必须继续遵守1972年签订的反弹道导弹条约并按照原文对条约作狭义解释，如一方违反反弹道导弹条约，另一方即可废除战略武器条约。苏联将同意在太空进行某些实验和试验，但苏美之间应就此类实验和试验进行讨论。苏联还同意撤除克拉斯诺亚斯克雷达站。
    贝克国务卿称，苏联的上述主张是“积极的一步”，可能为达成美苏削减战略武器条约开辟新的前景。
