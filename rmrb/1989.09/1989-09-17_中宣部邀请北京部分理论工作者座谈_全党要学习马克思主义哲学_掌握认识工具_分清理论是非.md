Recently, the Theory Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department invited some theoretical workers in Beijing to hold a discussion meeting. The topics discussed included the importance of studying Marxist philosophy at present, how to study Marxist philosophy, how to eliminate the influence of bourgeois liberalization, and how to strengthen the theoretical construction of the Party's cadre team.

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Party Central Committee proposed to strengthen the study of Marxist theory and emphasized that the current focus should be on studying philosophy. The scholars present unanimously agreed that this is a major political task facing the entire Party, with profound significance. It will help to clear up theoretical confusion, unify and elevate people's ideological understanding, improve the ideological and theoretical level of cadres, and push forward the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

In connection with the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing this spring and summer, the participants pointed out that one of the important reasons for the turmoil was the spread of bourgeois liberalization, which caused ideological and theoretical confusion. Proposing to study Marxist philosophy is a necessity in the current struggle against bourgeois liberalization. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the theoretical foundations that guide our thinking. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization concentrate their theoretical attacks on Marxism, spreading the theory that Marxism is "outdated." Their goal is to deny the guiding role of Marxism and shake our theoretical foundations. As an important component of Marxism, Marxist philosophy has also been greatly impacted by the bourgeois liberalization trend.

When listing the impact of bourgeois liberalization on Marxist philosophy, the participants said that those promoting bourgeois liberalization, under the banner of "innovation," fundamentally deny Marxist philosophy, attacking it as outdated and heading towards "death." They deny almost every aspect of Marxist philosophy, from its system to its basic theories and basic viewpoints. Under the influence of this trend, some people deny the scientific division between materialism and idealism, claiming that discussing the materiality of the world is metaphysics, and that discussing matter first and consciousness second is mechanical materialism. They attempt to replace reflection theory with the theory of the origin of cognition, to use systems theory to oppose dialectical theory, to use abstract humanism and humanitarianism to deny the theory that the mode of social material production is the basis of social existence, to use the theory of "elite" politics to deny the theory of the role of the masses in history, to use the theory of peasant war destruction to deny class struggle theory, and to use social totality theory to deny the theory that social existence determines social consciousness. This has caused great confusion in the theoretical field and among cadres and the masses, making it necessary to clarify these issues through the study of Marxist philosophy.

The participants believed that studying Marxist philosophy is also a requirement of practice and a necessity for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Marxist philosophy is the most scientific and complete worldview and methodology for humanity so far, a "great tool of cognition." The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics proposed by our Party is the product of combining Marxism, including dialectical and historical materialism, with the practice of China's modernization. The formulation, implementation, and execution of our lines, policies, and principles cannot do without the guidance of Marxist philosophy. Through the practice of socialist construction and reform and opening up in our country over the years, as well as the problems that have arisen in reality, it reflects the importance and urgency of studying Marxist philosophy at present. Practice has proven that by mastering Marxist philosophical thought and using a correct worldview and methodology to observe and analyze problems, one can grasp the essence in a complex web of contradictions, grasp the direction in an ever-changing development of things, find solutions to various difficulties, and strengthen the principles, systematicness, foresight, and creativity in one's work. Only in this way can the modernization of socialism and reform and opening up develop in the correct direction, can people's level of understanding and practical work be improved, can mistakes be reduced, and can major errors be avoided.

Regarding how to study Marxist philosophy in the new situation, the participants had a wide-ranging discussion. Everyone agreed that to study Marxist philosophy well, one must first learn the basic viewpoints of dialectical and historical materialism, and grasp the essence of Marxist worldview and methodology. One should not only learn the general conclusions drawn by the revolutionary teachers based on the social practice and revolutionary experience of their time but also learn their methods of observing and solving problems. Only in this way can one improve one's philosophical thinking ability. Secondly, one should carry forward the fine tradition of combining theory with practice and theory with reality, and closely combine the study of philosophy with the summary of work and the transformation of one's subjective world. Using the Marxist stance, viewpoint, and method, one should summarize the successful experiences and shortcomings of one's department or region's work, especially link it with one's own ideological reality for reflection, eliminate the influence of idealism and metaphysics, and truly establish a scientific worldview in one's thoughts, and firmly believe in socialism and communism. Thirdly, leading cadres at all levels should play a leading role, not only studying seriously themselves and setting an example but also treating it as a major task in the ideological and theoretical construction of cadres, organizing the learning of general cadres and the masses.

Jin Huiming, Director of the Theory Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. He said that studying Marxist theory, including studying Marxist philosophy, is a fundamental task of ideological construction for our Party and a long-term strategic task. Only by mastering the Marxist worldview and methodology can we fundamentally improve the theoretical and political quality of cadres, improve the level of cognition and practical work, and meet the requirements of the new situation of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up. In the current international climate, one should understand the great significance of studying Marxist philosophy from the perspective of the struggle against "peaceful evolution" and countering "peaceful evolution" and domestic ideological struggles. He emphasized that promoting the study of Marxist philosophy by cadres and the masses, and improving the theoretical thinking of the entire nation, is an important task that every philosophy worker must undertake. At present, one should, based on solid research, write articles and monographs with sufficient persuasiveness and theoretical depth, targeting the theoretical right and wrong that has been confused by bourgeois liberalization, to help people truly master the basic viewpoints and methods of dialectical and historical materialism.

    中宣部邀请北京部分理论工作者座谈
　　全党要学习马克思主义哲学
　　掌握认识工具　分清理论是非
    本报讯　最近，中宣部理论局邀请北京部分理论工作者举行座谈会，就当前学习马克思主义哲学的重要意义，如何学习马克思主义哲学，清除资产阶级自由化的影响，以及加强党的干部队伍的理论建设等问题进行了讨论。
    党的十三届四中全会后，党中央提出要加强马克思主义的理论学习，并强调当前重点是学习哲学。与会学者一致认为，这是摆在全党面前的一个重大政治任务，具有深远的意义，将有利于廓清理论上的迷雾，统一和提高人们的思想认识，提高广大干部的思想理论水平，把建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大实践胜利推向前进。
    联系今年春夏之际在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的实际，与会者指出，发生这场动乱的一个重要原因，是资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥所造成的思想混乱和理论混乱。提出学习马克思主义哲学，正是当前反对资产阶级自由化斗争的需要。马列主义、毛泽东思想是指导我们思想的理论基础，搞资产阶级自由化的人，从理论上集中攻击马克思主义，散布马克思主义“过时论”，其目的就是否定马克思主义的指导地位，动摇我们的理论基础。而作为马克思主义重要组成部分的马克思主义哲学，也受到了资产阶级自由化思潮的很大冲击。
    与会者在列举资产阶级自由化思潮对马克思主义哲学的冲击时说，搞资产阶级自由化的人打着“创新”的旗号，从根本上否定马克思主义哲学，攻击它已经过时，正在走向“死亡”。他们对马克思主义哲学的否定，差不多涉及到各个方面，从马克思主义哲学体系到基本理论、基本观点，几乎无一幸免。在这种思潮的影响下，有的人否定唯物主义与唯心主义的科学划分，认为讲世界的物质性是形而上学，讲物质第一、意识第二就是机械唯物论，并企图用发生认识论代替反映论，用系统论反对矛盾论，用抽象的人性论和人道主义否定社会物质生产方式是社会存在的基础的理论，用“精英”政治论否定人民群众在历史上的作用的理论，用农民战争破坏论否定阶级斗争理论，用社会总体论否定关于社会存在决定社会意识的理论等。在理论领域和干部群众中造成了极大的混乱，很有必要通过学习马克思主义哲学予以澄清。
    与会者认为，学习马克思主义哲学，也是实践提出的要求，是建设有中国特色的社会主义实践的需要。马克思主义哲学是人类迄今为止最科学、最完整的世界观和方法论，是“伟大的认识工具”。我们党提出的建设有中国特色的社会主义理论就是马克思主义包括辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义与中国现代化建设实践相结合的产物，我们的路线、方针和政策的制定、贯彻和执行，都离不开马克思主义哲学的指导。通过多年来我国社会主义建设和改革开放的实践，以及从现实中出现的问题，反映了当前学习马克思主义哲学的重要性和迫切性。实践证明，掌握了马克思主义哲学思想，用正确的世界观和方法论观察和分析问题，就可以在纷繁复杂的矛盾中抓住根本，在变幻莫测的事物发展中把握方向，在各种各样的困难中找到解决的途径，加强工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性。只有这样，社会主义现代化建设、改革开放才能沿着正确的方向发展，才能提高人们的认识水平和实际工作水平，减少失误，避免犯大的错误。
    对在新形势下如何学好马克思主义哲学，与会者进行了广泛的讨论。大家认为，学好马克思主义哲学，首先要学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基本观点，掌握马克思主义世界观和方法论的真谛。不仅要学习革命导师根据当时的社会实践和革命经验而得出的关于一般规律的结论，而且应当学习他们观察问题和解决问题的方法。只有这样，才能提高自己的哲学思维能力。其次，要发扬理论与实践相结合、理论联系实际的优良学风，把哲学学习同总结工作和改造主观世界紧密结合起来。运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，对本部门、本地区工作的成功经验和不足之处进行总结，尤其是要联系自己的思想实际进行反思，清除唯心主义和形而上学的影响，真正从思想上确立科学的世界观，坚定社会主义和共产主义的信念。再次，各级领导干部要发挥带头作用，不仅自己要认真学习，作出榜样，而且要把它作为干部思想理论建设的一件大事来抓，组织好一般干部和群众的学习。
    中央宣传部理论局局长靳辉明主持了会议，他说，学习马克思主义理论、包括学习马克思主义哲学，是我们党的一项根本性的思想建设，是一项长期的战略任务。只有掌握马克思主义世界观和方法论，才能从根本上提高广大干部的理论素质和政治素质，提高认识能力和实际工作的水平，以适应社会主义现代化建设和改革、开放新形势的要求。在当前的国际大气候下，应当从“和平演变”与反“和平演变”和国内意识形态斗争的角度，去理解学习马克思主义哲学的重大意义。他强调，推动广大干部群众学习马克思主义哲学，提高全民族的理论思维，是我们每个哲学工作者责无旁贷的重要任务。当前，应该在扎扎实实地研究的基础上，针对被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的理论是非，写出有充分说服力的有理论深度的文章、专著，帮助人们真正掌握辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基本观点和基本方法。
