    How to Spend 400,000 Yuan?
    The town of Fengzhen in Xi'an is located in a remote area, about 50 kilometers away from Baoying County, making transportation inconvenient. Town officials often find it difficult to return on the same day when they go to the county seat for business. Additionally, the office conditions of the town government are quite poor. The town party committee discussed a plan at the beginning of last year: to build an office building and purchase a van by 1989 to address the issues of cramped office space and the difficulty of traveling to the county seat. A year has passed, and 400,000 yuan has been raised. Just as preparations were being made to implement the plan, the town party secretary, Wu Yanzi, thought of the difficulties faced by more farmers who had no bridges to enter the town and no roads for vehicle transportation. How should the 400,000 yuan be spent? At the beginning of this year, Wu Yanzi convened a party committee meeting to discuss whether to improve office conditions by building the office and buying the van, or to build bridges and roads to help the people. Some said, "Our town needs to build the office and buy the van, and there is no need to hesitate." But more people said, "Considering the actual situation of our town, we should temporarily stop building the office and buying the van, tighten our belts for a few years, and use the limited funds to improve transportation conditions, which is more in line with the interests of the people." After a discussion, the thoughts of the party committee members were unified. They changed the original plan and began the construction of the 1.5-kilometer-long, 7-meter-wide Xingan Road and the 15-ton Xingan Bridge. The project will be completed by this year's National Day.

    四十万元钱怎么花？
    西安丰镇地处偏僻，离宝应县城还有50多公里，交通不便，镇干部进城办事，当天难以赶回。再者，镇机关的办公条件也较差。镇党委去年初曾做过一次讨论：设法在1989年建一幢办公楼，买一辆面包车，解决镇干部办公用房紧、进城乘车难的问题。一年过去了，40万元筹足了，正准备付诸实行时，镇党委书记吴雁芝却想到更多的农民因进镇无桥，车辆运输无路的困难。40万元该怎么花？今年初吴雁芝召集党委会，围绕着“是改善办公条件建楼买车，还是为群众解难建桥铺路”展开讨论。有人说：“我镇建楼买车是实际需要，无需犹豫。”但更多的人讲：“根据本镇的实际情况，暂停建楼买车，过几年紧日子，把有限的资金用于改善交通条件，更符合群众的利益。”经过一番讨论，党委一班人的思想统一了，改变了原计划，开始了全长1.5公里、宽7米的兴安路和载重量为15吨的兴安桥的建设，今年国庆节可见效果。
