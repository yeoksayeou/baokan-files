Military Academies Produce Abundant Talents

Military academies, often referred to as the "cradle of generals," actually nurture more than just generals. Over the past decade, our military academies have trained tens of thousands of various levels and types of talents for the nation.

Military academies share the same fate as our country. During the Cultural Revolution, Lin Biao and the Gang of Four, driven by their political needs, drastically reduced the number of academies. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Military Commission made a decision that "one cannot become an officer without training in an academy, and one cannot be promoted without training in an academy." This decision has led to the flourishing development of military academies. A three-tiered training system of primary, intermediate, and advanced levels has been established; the system of academic training and on-the-job training for officers at various levels has been gradually implemented; the training levels have become increasingly refined, and the academies have continuously supplied various levels and types of talents to the troops.

Now, compared to 1980, the proportion of junior officers who have received academy training has increased from 14.3% to 88.5%; the proportion of corps and division-level leadership team members who have received academy training has reached 56.7%; most of the regimental-level and above leaders and military-level staff have a college education or higher. Moreover, military academies adhere to a firm and correct political direction, seriously focusing on political theory teaching and the cultivation of students' political qualities, laying a solid ideological foundation for nurturing officers who are dedicated to national defense.

At the same time, the teaching and research achievements of military academies are remarkable. Before the recent Teachers' Day, the entire military selected 145 outstanding teaching achievements at the military level. In addition, 150 military educators received national-level honors, and 207 outstanding teachers and educators in the military were awarded by the General Staff Department.

    军校育才硕果累累
    军校，人称“将军的摇篮”，其实，这个“摇篮”里培养的何止是将军。10年来，我军院校已为全国培养各级各类人才达数十万之众。
    军校与我们的国家俱荣俱损。“文革”时，林彪、“四人帮”出于他们的政治需要，大砍院校。党的十一届三中全会以后，中央军委定下“不经院校培训不能成为军官，不经院校培训不能晋升职务”的决策，使军校建设蓬勃发展。军校初、中、高三级培训体系已经形成；各级军官学历培训与岗位培训制度逐步得到落实；培训层次日臻完善，院校为部队输送的各级各类人才源源不断。
    现在，全军军官与1980年相比，排职干部院校受训率由14.3％提高到88.5％；军、师领导班子成员的院校受训率也已达到56.7％；团职以上领导干部和军以上机关干部，大都具有大专以上文化程度。而且，军校坚持坚定正确的政治方向，认真抓好政治理论教学和学员政治素质的培养，为造就自觉献身国防的军官，打下了坚实的思想基础。
    同时，军校教学、科研成果引人瞩目。今年教师节前夕，全军评选出了145项军队级优秀教学成果奖。另外，150名军旅园丁获得国家级荣誉称号，207名全军优秀教师和教育工作者，受到三总部颁奖表彰。　（峻岭）
