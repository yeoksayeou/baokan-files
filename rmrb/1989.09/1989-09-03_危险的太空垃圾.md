Observations indicate that there are 7,200 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimeters orbiting in space. If smaller fragments are included, the number reaches several million. Space is filled with debris.

Recently, at the 9th International Conference on the Peaceful Use of Military Technology in Italy, Professor Vittorio Canuto, a senior scientist from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), discussed the issue of space debris with a reporter. He said that space contains all sorts of objects, from paint chips that have fallen off spacecraft protective layers to discarded artificial satellites, and even a screwdriver lost by an American astronaut during a spacewalk. These objects travel at speeds of several thousand kilometers per second, becoming dangerous "floating bombs."

Space debris is more dangerous than meteorite fragments. There are a total of 3,000 kilograms of meteorite fragments orbiting Earth, while there are 3,000 tons of debris. In the future, orbital stations set up in space will face a collision risk with floating space debris every two years, whereas the risk of being hit by meteorite fragments is only once every 4,000 years. Calculations show that a 40-square-meter artificial satellite has a 1-in-100 chance of collision every 100 years. However, commercial aircraft do not face this danger. Space debris gradually approaches Earth and disintegrates. Aircraft have a larger surface area but fly at much lower altitudes. So far, there have been no major collisions in space, but minor collisions have occurred. It is said that a protective layer on an American space shuttle was punctured by a piece of space debris, fortunately, it was very small.

The uranium in space debris is also a danger. Calculations show that there are 1,465 kilograms of uranium-235 in the reactors in orbit. Most space debris is concentrated at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers, which is a "graveyard" of scrap metal; the reactors containing uranium also seem to be in orbits at this altitude, making it another "graveyard." Unused artificial satellites are often sent to this location. One can imagine the danger of space debris colliding with these abandoned satellites containing uranium.

Facing the increasing amount of space debris, humanity has not yet invented a "space broom." Therefore, some people suggest creating a magnetic field around space debris to attract the debris orbiting in space. NASA has proposed taking action to ensure that each "space vehicle" retains propulsion when it is no longer needed, pushing the space debris to a very distant and safe area outside the danger zone.

    危险的太空垃圾
    本报记者　罗晋标
    据观测，在太空轨道上有7200个10厘米以上的废物碎块在运转，如果把更小的碎块也算上，则达到数百万块。太空充满垃圾。
    最近在意大利参加第9届国际和平利用军事技术讨论会的美国国家航空航天局高级科学家维托里奥·卡努托教授对记者谈到太空垃圾问题时说，太空中什么东西都有，从宇宙飞船保护层上掉下的漆，到废弃的人造卫星，还有美国宇航员在太空散步中失落的一把改锥。这些东西以每秒数千公里的速度在运转，成为危险的“飘游炸弹”。
    太空废物比陨石碎块更为危险。太空中围绕地球的陨石碎块总计3000公斤，废物则有3000吨。将来设置在太空中的轨道站，与太空飘游废物相撞的危险为每两年1次，而被陨石碎块所击中的危险只为每4000年1次。据计算，面积为40平方米的一颗人造卫星每100年有1次碰撞危险。不过，民航飞机没有这种危险。太空废物逐渐靠近地球时分裂而粉碎了。飞机比卫星面积大，但飞行高度要低得多。至今，在太空中没有发生过大碰撞，但小碰撞则有过。据说，美国一架航天飞机的保护层上被一块太空废物打了个洞，幸而非常小。
    太空废物中的铀也是个危险。据计算，在轨道上的反应堆带有1465公斤铀235。太空废物多集中在1000公里高空处，这是一个废铁“坟墓”；而带有铀的反应堆似乎也在1000公里高空处的轨道上，这又是一个“坟墓”，不再使用的人造卫星往往被送到此处。可以想象，太空废物与这些带有铀的废弃卫星相撞而带来的危险。
    面对日益增多的太空垃圾，人类还没有发明“太空扫帚”，因此有人设想在太空废物周围搞个磁场，把在轨道上运转的太空废物吸住。美国航空航天局设想采取行动，使每个
  “太空车”当没有存在的必要时还留有推进力，能将太空垃圾推到危险区之外的非常遥远的太空中去。
