The Ministry of Light Industry's Art and Crafts Corporation Found to Have Operated Illegally and Is Punished

Over 20 Million Yuan in Illegal Income Confiscated

Responsible Parties Receive Party and Administrative Discipline

BEIJING, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Recently, the Ministry of Supervision, in conjunction with the National Audit Office, the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, and other departments, has seriously investigated and punished the Ministry of Light Industry's Art and Crafts Corporation for long-term illegal operations under the guise of administrative management. Based on the verified facts, the State Council decided: to confiscate all of the Art and Crafts Corporation's illegal income of over 22 million yuan and remit it to the state treasury; to order the Ministry of Light Industry to impose party and administrative discipline on the main responsible persons and direct perpetrators of the illegal operations. In accordance with the spirit of the State Council's decision, the Ministry of Light Industry has imposed the punishment of removing the current deputy manager, Qiu Jingcheng, from his post. The relevant party organizations have given the former manager, Qi Zheng (retired), and the former deputy manager, Wang Zhenrong (retired), a serious warning within the party.

The Art and Crafts Corporation is responsible for the administrative tasks of production planning, export of products, and distribution of materials for the national art and craft and tourism product manufacturing industries. In 1981, the corporation, without approval from the industrial and commercial administration and the materials department, engaged in the trading of state-allocated and imported materials, continuing this unlicensed operation until October 1988, a total of seven years.

The corporation violated relevant state regulations by using its authority to apply for special foreign exchange and planned imports of materials to sell and resell imported synthetic fibers and other materials in large quantities to entities outside the supply chain, such as the Changsha Textile Industry Materials Supply and Marketing Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Changsha Textile Corporation). From early 1983 to April 1987, the amount of imported synthetic fibers sold to Changsha Textile Corporation alone reached 9,936 tons, accounting for 20% of the total amount of imported synthetic fiber raw materials for the industry during the same period, and utilizing 1,500 million US dollars in central special foreign exchange. The corporation gained a pure profit of 4.58 million yuan. In addition, the Art and Crafts Corporation also resold imported synthetic fibers to other industry-external units, gaining a pure profit of 1.02 million yuan.

In the distribution of materials within the industry, the Art and Crafts Corporation also used its authority to violate regulations on fees and prices, deducting funds from subordinate enterprises and illegally profiting. Before the foreign trade system reform, the corporation intercepted the "reverse deduction" that should have been returned by the foreign trade department to the provincial and municipal material transfer departments and repeatedly collected fees, gaining a pure profit of 2.94 million yuan. After the foreign trade system reform, the corporation violated relevant pricing regulations and set its own prices for profit. From July 1985 to the end of 1987, the corporation gained a pure profit of 12.7 million yuan from the marked-up sales of high-pressure polyethylene, synthetic fiber raw materials, and other items. The corporation also failed to pay 900,000 yuan in taxes.

The Art and Crafts Corporation began unlicensed operations in 1981, illegally gaining over 22 million yuan. Among the illegal operating income, 19.44 million yuan was invested in the "Art and Crafts Museum and Ministry of Light Industry Office Building" project in the form of planned self-raised funds, extra-plan bonuses (overtime pay), and special expenditure fees (used for entertaining, gift-giving, and other expenses in engineering construction).

The Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has imposed a fine of 1 million yuan on the corporation.

    轻工部工艺美术总公司违法经营被查处
    两千余万非法收入全部没收
    有关责任者受党纪政纪处分
    本报北京九月二十二日讯　记者舒瑜报道：最近，监察部会同审计署、北京市工商局等部门，对轻工部工艺美术总公司利用行政管理职权，长期违法经营等问题进行了严肃查处。根据查证的事实，国务院研究决定：没收工艺美术总公司全部非法收入二千二百余万元，上交国家财政；责成轻工部对该公司违法经营的主要负责人和直接责任者给予党纪、政纪处分。根据国务院的决定精神，轻工部给予该公司现任副经理邱景成撤销副经理职务的处分，有关党组织对公司原经理祁政（已离休）、公司原副经理王振荣（已离休）给予党内严重警告处分。
    工艺美术总公司是负责全国工艺美术、旅游产品生产行业的生产计划、产品出口、物资分配等业务的行政性公司。一九八一年，该公司未经工商行政管理和物资部门批准，就经营国拨和进口物资，直到一九八八年十月，无照经营长达七年之久。
    该公司违反国家有关规定，利用有向国家申请专项外汇和计划内物资进口指标的权利，将进口化纤等物资大量向供应渠道以外的长沙市纺织工业物资供销公司（以下称长纺公司）销售、倒卖。自一九八三年初到一九八七年四月，仅卖给长纺公司的进口化纤就达九千九百三十六吨，占同期国家给本行业生产进口的化纤原料数量的百分之二十，占用了中央专项外汇一千五百余万美元，该公司获纯利四百五十八万余元。此外，工艺美术总公司还向其它行业外单位倒卖进口化纤，获纯利一百零二万余元。
    工艺美术总公司在本行业物资分配中，还利用职权，违反收费、价格等规定，克扣下属企业的款项，非法牟利。外贸体制改革前，该公司截留外贸部门返回的应给省市物资中转部门的“倒扣”，并重复收费获纯利二百九十四万余元。外贸体制改革后，该公司违反有关作价规定，自定价格牟利。从一九八五年七月到一九八七年底，该公司对高压聚乙烯、化纤原料等加价销售获纯利一千二百七十余万元。该公司还漏交税款九十余万元。
    工艺美术总公司从一九八一年开始无照经营，非法获利二千二百余万元。在违法经营收入中，将其中一千九百四十四万余元以计划内自筹资金、计划外奖金（赶工费）、特殊支出费（用于工程建设中请客、送礼、应酬等开支）等形式投入“工艺美术馆及轻工部办公楼”工程。
    北京市工商局对该公司作出罚款一百万元的处理。
