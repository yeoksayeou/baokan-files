Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with a delegation led by Milan Vaclavik, Minister of Defense of Czechoslovakia, this afternoon at Zhongnanhai.

During the meeting, Jiang Zemin said that China and Czechoslovakia have a traditional friendship. Both he and Vaclavik expressed satisfaction with the development of bilateral relations in recent years and hoped to further develop this friendly cooperative relationship. Vaclavik said that strengthening Czech-Chinese friendship is not only in the interests of both sides but also conducive to maintaining world peace and stability.

Jiang Zemin, in discussing China's domestic situation, said that the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee have been correct. In the future, it is necessary to resolutely implement the "one central task, two fundamental points" proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress, to continue reform and opening up, and to "firmly uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization" without relaxing. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the Party and give full play to the political core role of Party organizations at all levels.

Qin Jiwei, State Councilor and Minister of Defense, was present at the meeting.
