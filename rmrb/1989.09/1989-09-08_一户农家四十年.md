In early 1950, I, as a photojournalist for the Zhejiang Daily, went to Jiaxing County for an interview. Passing through Qixing Township's Er Village, I suddenly heard the song "The sky in the liberated area is bright and clear, the people in the liberated area are so happy..." Following the melody, I found the home of the emancipated farmer Ye Gentu and took a family portrait for them. In this photograph, the tattered clothes made from old rags and cotton wadding worn by the three children recorded the deep scars left by the old society. It also reflected the joy of farmers' liberation from the smiling face of Ye Gentu. After that, I visited this family many times.

Forty years later, how are these three children, who were born in the old society and grew up in New China, doing? I followed up and took three more photographs.

The right image is a group photo of Ye Gentu's family in the early days of liberation: the person on the left in the back row is Ye Gentu's wife, the person on the right is Ye Gentu, and the one in the middle being held is the youngest son, Ye Xingyou. In the front row, the person on the left is the daughter, Ye Guifen, and the person on the right is the eldest son, Ye Xingfu.

Ye Gentu's eldest son, Ye Xingfu, returned to Jiaxing from the military and in 1984 became the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the seventh division of Jiaxing City Agricultural Reclamation Farm. On his day off, Ye Xingfu rides a brand-new bicycle with his wife and daughter, happily going into the city.

Ye Xingyou, who was in his father's arms during the early days of liberation, is now 40 years old. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, his family planted orange trees every year and built a new house last year. This is Ye Xingyou and his wife, Gao Dongqing, selecting high-quality oranges to sell to the state.

Ye Gentu's eldest daughter, Ye Guifen, who led Ye Xingfu in singing "The sky in the liberated area is bright and clear" in those days, became the deputy director of the village women's federation in 1980. This is Guifen educating children to grow up and build a new mountain village through hard work and entrepreneurship.

    一户农家四十年
    徐永辉
    1950年初，我作为浙江日报的摄影记者，去嘉兴县采访。路过七星乡二村时，忽然听到一阵“解放区的天，是明朗的天，解放区的人民好喜欢……”我循着歌声，找到了翻身农民叶根土的家，并给他们全家拍了一张“全家福”。在这幅照片里，从三个孩子穿着破布、旧棉絮拼凑的破烂衣服上，记录了旧社会给他们留下深重灾难的痕迹；也从叶根土的笑嘻嘻的脸庞上，反映了农民翻身解放的喜悦。此后，我多次到这户农家作客。
    40年后的今天，这三个出生在旧社会、成长在新中国的孩子，情况怎么样了呢？我跟踪采访，又拍摄了三张照片。（附图片）
    右图为解放初期叶根土一家的合影：后排左一为叶根土的妻子，右一为叶根土，中间抱着的是小儿子叶兴友。前排左为女儿叶桂凤，右为大儿子叶兴富。
    叶根土的大儿子叶兴富从部队转业回嘉兴，一九八四年担任嘉兴市农垦场七分场的党支部副书记。休息天，叶兴富推着崭新的自行车与妻子女儿高高兴兴地进城去。
    叶兴友，解放初期时还在父亲的怀里，现在已40岁了。党的十一届三中全会后，他家每年种植桔树，去年造起了新房。这是他和妻子高冬青在选优良桔子，卖给国家。
    叶根土的大女儿，当年领着叶兴富唱“解放区的天”的叶桂凤，1980年担任了村妇女会副主任。这是桂凤正在教育孩子长大后艰苦创业建设新山村。
