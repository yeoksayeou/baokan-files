Bush Proposes Anti-Drug Plan

Our reporter Cang Lide reports from Washington: President Bush tonight, in his first televised address to the nation since taking office, proposed a federal anti-drug plan for the 1990 fiscal year with an estimated cost of approximately $8 billion.

In this, the largest anti-drug plan the United States has ever undertaken, Bush proposed four main measures. First, strengthen legal penalties. The federal government will allocate $1.5 billion to expand local anti-drug law enforcement agencies below the state level, build new prisons, increase the number of courts and prosecutors, and swiftly and severely punish drug traffickers. Second, allocate $2 billion over five years to combat international drug producers, traffickers, and smugglers. The focus will be on supporting South American countries such as Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. In the next fiscal year, $250 million in military and law enforcement aid will be provided for anti-drug operations in these three countries. Third, allocate $321 million to expand drug rehabilitation medical facilities. Fourth, allocate an additional $250 million for schools and residential areas to help people of all ages prevent and resist the temptation to use drugs.

Bush urged Congress to approve an additional $717 million in new spending on top of the $710 million anti-drug budget he proposed at the beginning of the year.

    布什提出反毒品计划
    本报华盛顿9月5日电　记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今晚在其入主白宫后首次向全国发表的电视演说中，提出一项在1990财政年度耗资约80亿美元的联邦反毒品计划。
    在这项美国迄今最庞大的反毒品计划中，布什提出4项主要措施。一、加强法律制裁，联邦政府拨款15亿美元，扩充州以下地方反毒品执法机构，营建新监狱，增加法庭及检察官，从速从重处罚毒品贩。二、在5年内拨款20亿美元，打击国际毒品生产者、贩运者和走私者。重点支持南美哥伦比亚、玻利维亚和秘鲁，在下个财年为上述3国的反毒品行动提供2.5亿美元的军事和执法援助。三、拨款3.21亿美元，扩大戒毒医疗机构。四、为学校和居民区增拨2.5亿美元，帮助男女老幼预防和抵制吸毒诱惑。
    布什吁请国会在他年初提出的下个财年71亿美元反毒品预算的基础上，再批准7.17亿美元新开支。
