To invigorate the rural economy, apart from opening up markets, facilitating exchanges, and ensuring that the markets are both prosperous and orderly, choosing the right location for markets is crucial. For example, in the image of the market in You Suo, Er Yuan County, Dali Region, Yunnan, the stalls and crowds are jammed on the highway. This not only hinders the flow of materials within the province, region, and county but also poses a constant risk of traffic accidents, endangering people's lives and property.

　　别在公路上凑热闹
    活跃农村经济，除了开辟市场，便利交换，做到市场繁荣而又秩序井然以外，择地设市大有学问。像图中云南大理地区洱源县右所集市这样，摊点、人群挤在公路上，不仅影响省地县区内的物资交流，而且随时有发生交通事故、祸及人民生命财产的危险。
