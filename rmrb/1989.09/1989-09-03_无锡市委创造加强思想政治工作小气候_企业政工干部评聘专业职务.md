The Wuxi Municipal Party Committee in Jiangsu Province is making efforts to strengthen the atmosphere for ideological and political work. Starting from last July, the committee began evaluating and appointing professional titles for enterprise political work cadres. Over the past year, nearly 6,000 political work cadres from more than half of the enterprises in the city participated in the evaluation and appointment process, resulting in 45 senior managers, 992 managers, and over 4,000 assistant managers and clerks.

At last year's ideological and political work conference in Wuxi, in response to the trend of weakening and downplaying ideological and political work in society, the Municipal Party Committee emphasized that political work cadres are a valuable asset to our party, and this team must not be disbanded. With the support of the Provincial Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committee conducted pilot projects and explored a path for evaluating and appointing professional titles for political work cadres.

The evaluation and appointment work has been conducted under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee. Based on the objective nature of ideological and political work, which involves the ideological education and behavioral management of people, it was ultimately defined as the "thought and behavior management" profession, included in the "management" series. The evaluation and appointment office, in reference to the relevant regulations of the "economy" series and in combination with the actual situation of this profession, formulated the "Wuxi City Thought and Behavior Management Professional Title Evaluation and Appointment Detailed Rules," clearly defining the principles, scope, conditions, assessments, and appointments of the evaluation and appointment process. Due to the reliance on various levels of party organizations and the adherence to ideological and political work during the evaluation process, the quality of the evaluation was ensured.

After the evaluation and appointment of professional titles for enterprise political work cadres, work enthusiasm has been stimulated, and many political work cadres have turned the enthusiasm aroused during the evaluation into conscious actions to promote the construction of both material and spiritual civilization. During the turmoil this year, the party organizations and the vast majority of political work cadres in the city's enterprises stood firm and clear, doing a great deal of work to stabilize public sentiment according to different audiences. In May and June, the political work cadres of Silk Textile Factory No. 1 organized activities such as "Stabilize the Situation, Fulfill Responsibilities, Express Your Heart" singing and speaking events throughout the factory to guide employees positively. The vast majority of employees in the city firmly held their posts, and many employees insisted on walking to work despite traffic disruptions, ensuring the normal operation of production.

The evaluation and appointment work has also enhanced the self-awareness of political work cadres to study and improve their own qualities. Through the evaluation, many political work cadres realized their shortcomings in cultural level and theoretical cultivation, and the gap between their own qualities and the requirements of the obtained professional titles, and are determined to study culture and theory, making their work gradually transition from experience-based to professional and scientific.

    无锡市委创造加强思想政治工作小气候
    企业政工干部评聘专业职务
    本报讯　江苏省无锡市委努力创造加强思想政治工作的小气候。从去年7月开始，为企业政工干部评聘专业职务。一年来，全市企业半数以上的近6000名政工干部参加了专业职务评聘，评出高级管理师45名、管理师992名、助理管理师和管理员4000余名。
    在去年无锡市思想政治工作会议上，针对社会上出现的淡化、削弱思想政治工作的倾向，市委强调，政工干部是我们党的宝贵财富，这支队伍决不能散。在省委领导的支持下，市委通过试点，探索出一条为政工干部评聘专业职务的路子。
    评聘工作始终在市委的直接领导下进行。根据思想政治工作是从事人的思想教育和行为管理的客观性质，最后定为思想行为管理专业，列入“管理”系列，由评聘办公室参照“经济”系列的有关条例，结合本专业的实际情况，制订《无锡市思想行为管理专业职务评聘细则》，对评聘原则、范围、条件、考核、聘任等作出了明确规定。由于在评审过程中坚持依靠各级党组织，坚持思想政治工作，从而保证了评审质量。
    企业政工干部评聘专业职务以后，调动了工作积极性，许多政工干部把评聘中激发出来的工作热情化为促进两个文明建设的自觉行动。在今年的动乱期间，全市企业的党组织及广大政工干部立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，根据不同对象，做了大量稳定人心的工作。丝织一厂的政工干部五六月份在全厂开展“稳大局、尽责任、吐心声”演唱演讲会等活动，从正面引导职工。全市绝大多数单位职工都坚守岗位，许多职工在交通阻塞的情况下，坚持步行上班，保证了生产的正常进行。
    评聘工作还增强了政工干部学习和提高自身素质的自觉性。通过评聘，许多政工干部看到了自己在文化水平、理论修养上的不足，看到了自身素质与获得的专业职务要求之间的差距，决心努力学文化、学理论，使工作从经验型逐步向专业化、科学型的方向发展。
