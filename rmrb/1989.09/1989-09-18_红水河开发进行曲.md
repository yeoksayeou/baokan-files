The Red Water River, which receives water from the southern regions of Yunnan and Guizhou and the North Panjiang River, flows through mountains and valleys, and eventually merges with the Liujiang and Yujiang Rivers, joining the West River and flowing into the sea, is renowned for its "rich water, electricity, and minerals."

During the Ming Dynasty, the geographer Xu Xiake traveled alone through Yunnan and Guizhou, attempting to uncover the mysteries of the Red Water River, but failed to reach the source. Sun Yat-sen, in his "Plan for National Reconstruction," envisioned building a dam on the Red Water River to facilitate navigation and power generation, but this plan was not realized due to historical constraints. Li Zongren invited a team of electrical engineers from Guangxi to survey the Red Water River, but they were unable to proceed due to a lack of reference materials. It was only after the founding of New China that hydropower workers gradually recognized its potential: three times the water volume of the Yellow River, a natural drop of over 750 meters, and abundant hydropower resources that could be converted into over 600 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

In the mid-1980s, the first hydroelectric power station to be completed in the lower reaches of the Red Water River was the E'tan (medium-sized) Hydroelectric Power Station. Subsequently, the Daxia Hydroelectric Power Station stood tall in the middle reaches of the Red Water River. Its four 100,000-kilowatt water turbine generators convert the surging river flow into 2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, supplying power to all corners of the autonomous region. This large-scale hydroelectric power station, with its outstanding achievements in winning the National Quality Engineering Award and significant economic benefits, has set a stirring pace for the development of 10 cascade hydropower stations on the Red Water River.

In 1986, 80 kilometers upstream from Daxia, the construction of the Yantian Hydroelectric Power Station began. This power station, with a designed capacity of 1.21 million kilowatts, connects the upper and lower reaches, not only generating electricity but also regulating the flow of the upper and lower reaches. It is currently the largest hydropower station under construction on the Red Water River. The builders introduced advanced domestic and foreign technologies, effectively accelerating the project's progress. In the winter of 1987, they achieved the diversion of the river a year ahead of schedule. Currently, all construction is progressing faster than planned, and if funding is arranged in time, it is expected to generate electricity a year ahead of schedule in 1992.

On the construction site of the Tian Sheng Bridge Second-Level Power Station in the upper reaches of the Red Water River, another fierce battle is underway. The soldiers of the Water Resources and Electric Power Second Division of the Armed Police Force are facing various difficulties and dangers brought by the geological conditions, fighting intelligently and bravely. The majestic dam intercepting the Nanpan River is rising from the ground.

The second phase of the Tian Sheng Bridge First-Level Power Station and the Second-Level Power Station has signed a joint development contract with the Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the National Energy Investment Corporation. This new investment system will have a profound impact on China's hydropower construction.

In the upper reaches of the Red Water River, there is also a design for an ultra-large hydropower station—the Longtan Hydroelectric Power Station. According to the normal high-water level plan of 400 meters approved by the State Council, the reservoir capacity can reach 27.3 billion cubic meters, the power station's installed capacity exceeds 4 million kilowatts, and the annual power generation can reach 18.3 billion kilowatt-hours. It can also make the downstream cascade generate an additional 6.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Therefore, it is called the "leading project of the Red Water River cascade development" and the "jewel of the Red Water River." In May of last year, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and the National Energy Investment Corporation signed an intention to jointly invest in the development of Longtan. In August of this year, the Ministry of Energy revealed that in the next decade or so, China will focus on building a number of large and medium-sized hydropower stations, with the Longtan Hydroelectric Power Station being the first on the list.

　　红水河开发进行曲
    承云贵南、北盘江之水，劈崖越滩，蜿蜒奔泻于千山百?之间，然后集柳江、聚郁江、汇入西江、奔入大海的红水河，因享有“水电富矿”之称而遐迩闻名。
    明代地理学家徐霞客只身跋涉云贵，欲揭红水河的奥秘，三溯曲靖而未果。孙中山在他的《建国方略》中曾设想在红水河筑坝拦水，以利航运和发电，也因历史条件所限未能实现。李宗仁请来的电力工程师广西考察团，虽想开发红水河，仍因无任何资料可供参考而望河兴叹。直到新中国成立后，水电工作者才逐渐认识了它的诱人之处：3倍于黄河的水量，750多米的天然落差，蕴藏的丰富水电资源，可转变成600多亿千瓦小时的电能。
    80年代中叶，在红水河下游，率先竣工的是恶滩（中型）水电站。接着，大化水电站又在红水河的中游巍然屹立，4台10万千瓦的水轮发电机，每年把滚滚江流化作20亿千瓦小时的电能，输送到自治区的四面八方。正是这座大型水电站，以获得国家级优质工程奖和可观经济效益的卓著功绩，为红水河10座梯级电站的开发奏出了激越的进行曲。
    1986年，在大化上游80多公里处，打响了建设岩滩水电站的战役。这座电站设计装机121万千瓦，它承上接下，除自身的发电效益外，还对上下游起调节作用，是红水河目前在建的最大水电站。建设者们引进国内外先进技术，有效地加快工程进度，1987年冬提前一年夺得截流胜利，现在各项工程进展均比原计划快，如资金调度及时，可望提前一年于1992年发电。
    在红水河上游的天生桥二级电站工地另有一番鏖战。武警部队水电二总队的指战员，面对地质条件带来的种种艰难险阻，斗智斗勇，拦截南盘江的巍巍大坝已拔地而起。
    天生桥一级电站和二级电站的二期工程，粤桂黔滇和国家能源投资公司已签定联合开发合约。这一新的投资体制，将给我国水电建设带来深远的影响。
    在红水河的上游还设计有一座特大水电站——龙滩水电站。这座电站按国务院批准的正常高水位400米高坝方案，库容可达273亿立方米，电站装机逾400万千瓦，年发电量可达183亿千瓦小时，还可使下游梯级多发出电62亿千瓦小时。为此，人们称它为“红水河梯级开发的龙头”，“红水河宝中之宝”。去年5月，两广、贵州和国家能源投资公司，签订了联合投资开发龙滩的意向书。今年8月，能源部透露，今后10多年我国将集中力量建设一批大中型水电站，龙滩水电站被排在第一位。
