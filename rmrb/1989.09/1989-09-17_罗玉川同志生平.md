The Life of Comrade Luo Yuchuan

Comrade Luo Yuchuan, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal and tested communist warrior, a revolutionary of the proletariat, a pioneer and outstanding leader in the forestry construction of New China, a member of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China, former Minister and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Forestry, passed away in Beijing on September 3, 1989, due to a sudden heart attack. He was 80 years old.

Comrade Luo Yuchuan was born in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, on September 14, 1909. As early as his student days, he joined the revolution and became a member of the Communist Party of China in March 1930. From 1936 onwards, he worked as a teacher while actively engaging in underground revolutionary activities.

From 1937 to 1949, Comrade Luo Yuchuan served as the Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Mancheng County Work Committee, the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Three-Area Committee, the Director of the Organization Department of the Suizhong Eight-Area Committee, the Secretary of the Fourth Area Committee, the Director of the Administrative Office of Suizhong, and the Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government. Throughout the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, he steadfastly fought in the Suizhong plains, making significant contributions to the victory of the national war of resistance. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he led the people of Suizhong in land reform, organized the development of production, mobilized the masses to join the army and fight, and led hundreds of thousands of militia and laborers to support the Battle of Pingjin, earning great merits for the liberation of the Chinese people.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Luo Yuchuan served as the Vice Minister and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Vice Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Pingyuan Provincial Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, the First Vice Minister and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forestry Industry, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Minister and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Forestry, and the Advisor to the Ministry of Forestry. He was a representative of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth National People's Congress, a representative of the Eighth, Eleventh, and Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and was elected as a member of the Central Advisory Commission at the Twelfth and Thirteenth National Congresses of the Communist Party of China.

During his tenure as a leader in Pingyuan Province, Comrade Luo Yuchuan effectively led the people of the entire province to restore and develop production, promote mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas, support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and carry out the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns. In 1952, he was transferred to work at the Ministry of Forestry. He organized investigations and research, drafted long-term plans for the development of forestry, and formulated the policy of "actively protecting forests, planned afforestation, and rational logging and utilization," which strongly promoted the recovery and development of forestry. Soon after arriving at the Ministry of Forestry, he personally led a work team to conduct investigations and research on the development of the rubber industry in the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, laying a solid foundation for the development of China's rubber industry. Under his leadership and direction, a national wood production and transportation management system was established, forestry enterprises were strengthened, and the national wood production increased significantly. Under his leadership, a relatively systematic forestry research institution and several higher and secondary forestry colleges were also established, opening up a broad prospect for the development of forestry science and education.

In 1964, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission decided to develop the Greater Khingan Range. Comrade Luo Yuchuan personally served as the Party Secretary and Political Commissar of the Development and Construction Command Headquarters and the Governor of the Greater Khingan Special District. Under the extremely harsh conditions of sparse population and severe cold, he led the way in carrying forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, enduring the hardships of cold and hunger, living and working with the people, sharing both hardships and joys, and always fighting on the front lines of development and construction, making immortal contributions to building the Greater Khingan Range into China's largest forestry production base.

During the ten years of turmoil, Comrade Luo Yuchuan was brutally persecuted by the counter-revolutionary clique of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," suffering great injustices. However, he always believed in Marxism-Leninism, believed that the cause of the Party and the people would surely be victorious, and under extremely difficult conditions, he still devoted his heart and soul to the work of the agricultural and forestry front.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, Comrade Luo Yuchuan resumed his work at the Ministry of Forestry. He firmly supported and conscientiously implemented the Party's line and various policies, and on the basis of systematically summarizing the experience and lessons of China's forestry construction, organized the formulation of policies, plans, and measures to accelerate the construction of China's forestry. He presided over the drafting of China's first Forest Law; presided over the formulation of the "Three North" protective forest construction plan; studied and determined the policy and measures to mobilize the masses to carry out large-scale afforestation, making China's forestry construction enter a new stage of reform and opening up.

In the summer of 1980, Comrade Luo Yuchuan firmly responded to the Party Central Committee's call to abolish the lifelong tenure system for leading cadres and submitted his resignation as Minister. After retiring to the second line, he continued to care about the cause of socialism and forestry work, and despite his old age and poor health, he often conducted in-depth investigations and research, putting forward many important suggestions.

Comrade Luo Yuchuan was dedicated to his duties for decades, strictly implementing the Party's line and various policies, always adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, being loyal to the Party and the people, studying diligently, and working hard. His life was a revolutionary life, a fighting life, a life of wholeheartedly serving the people, and a life of unremitting struggle for the realization of communism.
