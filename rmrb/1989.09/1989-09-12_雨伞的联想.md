A leading comrade discussed the ideological and political work of the previous period and expressed his concerns, saying that in the minds of some people, ideological and political work has become a "umbrella" in life. When "wind and rain" come, they hurriedly take it out to shield themselves; when the "wind and rain" pass, they discard it. I also have similar feelings about this.

During the ten years of the "Cultural Revolution," people suffered greatly from the emphasis on "politics in command" and the idea that "politics can override everything." After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, it was necessary and appropriate to correct these abnormal situations and free ideological and political work from the leftist constraints. However, in recent times, some comrades have gone to the other extreme in their attitude towards ideological and political work, showing a tendency to neglect it. They believe that ideological and political work is dispensable, so they sometimes grasp it and sometimes let it go, as the comrade mentioned, treating it like an "umbrella." Usually, they either put it in the "closet" or throw it in the "corner." When something urgent happens, they suddenly realize it's a big problem, hurriedly searching high and low. By the time they hurriedly open it, it might be worm-eaten or the "ribs" might be broken. If they encounter a heavy downpour, how can it block the rain?

As the saying goes, "Bring an umbrella on a sunny day, and bring food when full," which is a profound truth. People with life experience always bring items to shield from rain and cold when traveling far. This way, they can avoid getting wet in the rain or catching a cold. If we compare ideological and political work to an "umbrella," then we should take good care of this "umbrella," keeping it in good condition at all times. This way, no matter when, its function can be fully utilized.

　　雨伞的联想
　　王登平
    一位领导同志谈到前一时期的思想政治工作时，深感忧虑地说，在一些人的心目中，思想政治工作已经成了生活当中的一把“雨伞”。“风雨”来了，匆匆忙忙拿出来遮挡一下；“风雨”过后，就弃之一旁。对此，笔者也颇有同感。
    “文革”十年，人们饱尝了“突出政治”和“政治可以冲击一切”的苦头。十一届三中全会以后，对这种不正常状况进行拨乱反正，把思想政治工作从“左”的禁锢中解放出来，是完全必要和应该的。但一个时期以来，一些同志在对待思想政治工作问题上，却又走了另一个极端，出现了轻视思想政治工作的倾向。认为思想政治工作是可有可无，因而抓抓放放，放放抓抓，如上面那位同志所说，把它当作了“雨伞”。平时或放在“壁橱”里，或扔在“旮旯”里。事到临头才感到大事不好，慌慌张张，东寻西找。待到匆匆忙忙撑开，或被虫蛀鼠咬，或“伞骨”已被折断。若是遇到倾盆大雨，哪有挡雨之功。
    俗话说，“晴带雨伞，饱带干粮”，可谓至理名言。有生活经验的人出远门，总要带上遮雨挡寒的物件，这样，挨雨淋、受风寒的事就少得多。假如我们把思想政治工作也比作“伞”，那么，对这把“伞”应该十分精心保管，使它始终处于良好的状态。这样，无论在什么时候，它的作用都能够得到很好的发挥。
