The abandoned elderly have returned home. Your newspaper published a letter and photograph on April 26, page six, titled "Ashamed of the Elderly," which accurately reflected the situation. The town party committee and the town government attach great importance to this matter. A member of the town party committee and an information officer, along with the leaders of Kangling Village, criticized the sons and daughters-in-law of Old Wang for not supporting their father. They organized them to study relevant laws, making them realize that neglecting and abandoning the elderly is unacceptable by law. The next day, Old Wang was taken back home by his son.

    被遗弃的老人回了家
    你报4月26日第六版刊登《愧对老人》的来信和照片，反映情况属实。对此，我镇党委、镇政府很重视。我镇一名党委委员和一名信访干部会同康岭村领导批评了王老汉的几个儿子、儿媳不赡养父亲的行为，组织他们学习有关法律，使他们认识到虐待、遗弃老人是法律所不容忍的。第二天，王老汉被儿子接回了家。　湖北鹤峰县容美镇委　张宏生
