After the Korean War and the Indochina War, China hoped that the United States would withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait, ease Sino-American relations, and consolidate peace in Asia. To this end, China advocated for negotiations between the two countries.

In April 1955, during the Asian-African Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai announced that the Chinese government was willing to sit down with the U.S. government to discuss easing tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan region. Through the mediation of countries such as the United Kingdom, Indonesia, and India, on August 1, 1955, China and the U.S. began holding ambassadorial-level talks in Geneva. The agenda for the talks included two items: "the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries" and "other practical issues of contention between the two sides." After discussions, on September 10, 1955, both sides reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries. Both China and the U.S. acknowledged the right of civilians of the other country within their respective territories to return and announced that they had taken, and would continue to take, appropriate measures to enable them to exercise their right to return as soon as possible. Regarding the second agenda item, the Chinese side proposed discussing the embargo issue and preparing for higher-level Sino-American talks. Although the U.S. side verbally expressed no opposition to discussing the embargo issue, it stated that it could only discuss the embargo issue after reaching an agreement on the "renunciation of the use of force" in the Taiwan region, attempting to make China acknowledge the status quo of U.S. occupation of Taiwan. The talks reached a stalemate. On September 15, 1958, the Sino-American ambassadorial-level talks resumed in Warsaw. In the military and diplomatic struggles surrounding the shelling of Kinmen and Matsu, the Chinese government firmly opposed the U.S. drawing a line in the Taiwan Strait and plotting to create "two Chinas." The U.S. side proposed an immediate "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait region, insisting on interfering in China's internal affairs and refusing to accept China's conciliatory proposals, resulting in no progress on the key issue of easing and eliminating tensions in the Taiwan region. In the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Sino-American ambassadorial-level talks became a means for the two countries to maintain contact and exchange some views, and thus dragged on indefinitely. By February 1970, a total of 136 meetings had been held.

    中美举行大使级会谈
    朝鲜和印度支那停战以后，中国希望美国撤走在台湾海峡的武装力量，缓和中美关系，巩固亚洲和平。为此，中国主张中美两国举行谈判。
    1955年4月，周恩来总理在亚非会议期间宣布，中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论缓和远东局势的问题，特别是缓和台湾地区的紧张局势问题。经过英国、印度尼西亚、印度等国的斡旋，1955年8月1日，中美在日内瓦开始举行大使级会谈。会谈的议程，一是“双方平民回国问题”，二是“双方有所争执的其他实际问题”。经过讨论，1955年9月10日，双方就平民回国问题达成协议，中美双方承认在各自国家内的对方平民有返回的权利，并宣布已采取、且将继续采取适当措施使他们能够尽快行使其返回的权利。关于第二项议程的议题，中方提出一是禁运问题，二是准备更高一级的中美谈判问题。美方虽然口头上表示不反对讨论禁运问题，但声称只有对在台湾地区“放弃使用武力”问题达成协议，才能讨论禁运问题，企图使中国承认美国侵占台湾的现状。会谈陷入僵局。1958年9月15日，中美大使级会谈改在华沙复会。在围绕炮打金门、马祖进行的军事和外交斗争中，中国政府坚决反对美国在台湾海峡划线，制造“两个中国”的图谋。美方则提出在台湾海峡地区立即“停火”，坚持干涉中国内政，拒不接受中国的和解性方案，使会谈在缓和和消除台湾地区紧张局势这一关键问题上没有取得任何进展。在两国没有外交关系的情况下，中美大使级会谈成为两国保持接触、交换一些意见的途径，因而长期拖而不断。到1970年2月，中美大使级会谈共举行了136次会议。
