Recently, while traveling from Huainan to Hefei, I noticed that along a 20-kilometer stretch of road, there were over 30 roadside oil vendors. These vendors openly stored diesel and gasoline in the open air. The iron barrels containing the diesel and gasoline, after being exposed to high temperatures, emitted scorching heat. The risk of explosion and fire was ever-present whenever the barrels were opened to dispense oil. In Huaiyuan County, I observed that across from a gas station, individual vendors were selling diesel and gasoline. It is understood that the diesel and gasoline sold by these vendors were often procured through connections from state-owned enterprises.

    卖油者设摊公路两旁
    乱经营不安全危害大
    前不久，我从淮南去合肥，发现在一段不到20公里的公路两旁，竟有卖油摊点30多家。这些摊点，露天存放柴油、汽油。盛装柴油、汽油的铁桶经过高温暴晒，发出灼人的热气。开桶取油，随时有爆燃起火的危险。在怀远县城，我看到在加油站对面，一些个体摊贩在推销柴油、汽油。据了解，这些摊点的柴油、汽油，大多是通过关系，从国营单位套购的。
