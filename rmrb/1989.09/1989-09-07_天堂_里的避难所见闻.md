In the rugged mountains of southern Honduras lies the sparsely populated province of El Paraíso. In Spanish, "El Paraíso" means "paradise." Since the civil war in Nicaragua, this border province has become a refuge for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Whenever the Contra forces are overwhelmed, they cross the border to rest and regroup. Over time, with the U.S. providing funds and Honduras providing the land, the Contra have effectively taken control of this area. Local Hondurans, in contrast, have fled north to escape the conflict. Today, from the town of Yamales in El Paraíso to the south, the entire region is under Contra control. They have set up wooden barracks in previously uninhabited areas, bringing their families and engaging in farming and harvesting, much like the local farmers. Some have even opened small shops along the dirt roads to make a living.

Near the town of Capire, in a nearby estate, lies the main headquarters of the Contra in Honduras, known as the "General Staff." About 500 meters away is a makeshift helicopter landing pad, where helicopters frequently take off and land, bringing in supplies, medicine, and weapons of unknown origin. On the dirt paths between the barracks, one can sometimes see groups of soldiers. Most are equipped with AK-47 assault rifles. The majority of the Contra are quite young, some merely teenagers, with long hair and sunburned faces, looking very much like mountain folk. Some have no idea why they are fighting. Even those who can say, "We are fighting for democracy and freedom," struggle to explain what "democracy" and "freedom" mean when pressed further. A man named Jaime believes, "This war is like buying a lottery ticket. You never know when you'll win, but sometimes you suddenly hit the jackpot."

In reality, those who truly hope to "win the lottery" through war are the various "officers" within the Contra. A "commander" named Ruben admits that their demand for "democracy" is for the "Sandinistas to step down." However, ordinary Contra members have their own thoughts. "Power is ultimately a matter for the few," says one Contra. "Some 'officers' live in luxurious hotels in Washington and Miami, while we mountain people will exhaust our ammunition, lose our supply lines, and lose all our people. Now, whether refugees or military personnel, everyone is looking forward to returning to Nicaragua." The Contra have learned that the presidents of the five Central American countries have reached an agreement to disband the Contra and relocate them. To prevent the Contra from "escaping" before they are disarmed, the Honduran military has deployed strict security measures in El Paraíso. The majority of the Contra are victims of the Nicaraguan civil war. They must obey the highest command committee based in Miami, Florida. These leaders strategize in the U.S., while the ordinary Contra in the "refuge" shed blood. This is the reality of Contra "democracy."

"Thank God, all this will soon be over!" This is the sentiment of one Contra and the wish of most ordinary Contra members.

### “天堂”里的避难所见闻

    “天堂”里的避难所见闻
    本报记者　郭伟成
    洪都拉斯南部的崇山峻岭之中，是人烟稀少的埃尔帕赖索省。在西班牙语中，“埃尔帕赖索”是天堂的意思。尼加拉瓜内战以来，这个边境省份成了尼反政府武装（康特拉）的避难所。康特拉每当力不胜敌，就越过边境，休养生息。久而久之，干脆美国出钱，洪都拉斯出地，由着康特拉控制了这块地方。当地的洪都拉斯人反而为了躲避战乱而纷纷北迁了。如今，从埃尔帕赖索的亚马莱斯镇往南，已经全部成了康特拉的地盘。他们在过去人迹罕至的地方搭起了木头营房，拖儿带女，耕作收获，几与当地农民无异。有的还在土街两侧开起杂货铺，做小本买卖营生。
    在小镇卡皮雷附近的一处庄园里，驻扎着洪都拉斯境内康特拉的大本营“总参谋部”。五百米开外，是一座简易的直升飞机场，时不时起落的直升机，运来食物、药品及来路不明的武器弹药等其它给养。在营房间的土路上，有时可以看到成群结队的士兵。他们大多装备着AK—47冲锋枪。大多数康特拉很年轻，有的还只是十几岁的少年，头发长长的，脸晒得红红的，一副山里人模样。有的人压根儿不知道为什么要打仗。即便有些会说：“为了民主与自由而战斗”，但是，倘若再问什么叫
  “民主”与“自由”，他也就张口结舌了。当官模样的海梅认为，“这场战争好比是买彩票，买了也并不知道何时中彩，但是有时候突然会中头彩。”
    其实，真正想靠打仗“中彩”的，是康特拉里那些大大小小的“长官”。“总参谋部”的一位“长官”鲁文承认，他们要求的“民主”，是“桑地诺分子交权”。但是，普通康特拉也有自己的想法，“权力那玩艺儿毕竟是少数人的事情”。一位康特拉说：“有的‘长官’住在华盛顿与迈阿密的豪华旅店里，而我们这些山里人会耗尽了弹药，失去后勤补给，也会失去全部人民。现在，不管是难民还是军事人员，都期待着回到尼加拉瓜去。”康特拉们已经知道，中美洲五国总统达成协议，康特拉将被遣散，重新安置。为了防止康特拉在解除武装前“溜号”，洪都拉斯军队已经在埃尔帕赖索部署了严密的警戒。康特拉中的大多数是尼加拉瓜内战的“牺牲品”。因为他们得听命于设在美国迈阿密的最高领导委员会，这些长官们在美国“运筹帷幄”，流血的却是身在“避难所”里的普通康特拉。这是康特拉“民主”的现实。
      “谢谢上帝，这一切都快结束吧！”这是一位康特拉的话，也是绝大部分普通康特拉的愿望。
