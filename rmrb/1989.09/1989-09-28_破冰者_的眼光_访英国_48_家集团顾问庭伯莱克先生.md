**The Vision of the "Icebreaker"**

**— An Interview with Mr. Courtland Blake, Advisor to the 48 Group Club in the UK**

**By Chen Tetean, Correspondent of this Newspaper**

On the afternoon of September 15th, the reporter visited the headquarters of the 48 Group Club on Rosebery Street in London and met with Mr. Courtland Blake, an advisor to the club and an old friend of the Chinese people. The second-floor living room was simple and bright. Mr. Blake warmly received me here. This old advisor has been engaged in Sino-British trade for thirty-five years without interruption. Mr. Blake has visited China nearly 20 times, covering the vast expanse of China. He had just concluded his more than half-month-long visit to China, and our conversation began from there.

“Over the past 40 years, China has changed beyond recognition, with tremendous changes,” said Mr. Blake. “Leaving aside other aspects, just consider China’s foreign trade. In the mid-1950s, I remember that China’s total foreign trade volume was only 10 to 20 billion dollars. Now it has exceeded 100 billion dollars.” After a brief pause, he continued enthusiastically about his recent visit to China: “Especially in the past ten years, the Chinese people have made significant improvements in housing, clothing, and other aspects.” “Among socialist countries, China is a pioneer in introducing flexibility into the planned economic system.” He sincerely believes that a solution suitable for China’s national conditions can be found among different economic ideas.

Among the 48 Group Club, there are such a group of old friends of the Chinese people who have great confidence in China, far from just today. When the reporter asked why the 48 Group Club could become the “icebreaker” in Western countries’ development of trade with China, Mr. Blake said: The key lies in the 48 Group Club’s confidence in China’s economic development and market potential. In the early 1950s, when the Republic was in its infancy and facing difficult times, most Western countries imposed a trade embargo on China. A group of far-sighted individuals in Britain stood firm against all external pressures, forming the first Western trade delegation with 16 companies participating, and visited China in June 1953 to reach the first “Sino-British Trade Arrangement,” “breaking the ice” of the Western embargo. Therefore, this delegation has always been known as the “icebreaker” delegation. In April of the following year, to oppose the embargo and expand trade with China, they established the “British 48 Group Club” in London with 48 companies participating. From the late 1950s to the 1960s, the 48 Group Club persisted in opposing the “completely unfair restrictions and discrimination” by the West on imports from China and exports of technology to China, “breaking another layer of ice.” Since then, the 48 Group Club has been fighting for “China to receive equal treatment from non-European Community countries.”

This summer, the atmosphere in Western countries’ relations with China was seen as another form of “ice,” he continued: “Although there is no embargo, it has set up many obstacles on the trade road,” “The 48 Group Club’s attitude in this situation is very clear: Our basis for trade with China has not changed at all.” He believed that if this basis were damaged, it would be a great loss for the business communities and peoples of the two countries.

Therefore, the 48 Group Club, as usual, stood firm against all pressures and resolutely organized a delegation to visit China in August, and will organize a 70-person delegation in the latter half of October to visit Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other cities in groups. The 48 Group Club has signed a 6-year trade plan with seven provinces in China, with a total value of 54 billion dollars. All this shows that the 48 Group Club is determined to become the “economic icebreaker” for expanding trade with China again.

When discussing the opening of a new chapter in Sino-British economic and trade relations, Mr. Blake analyzed that, in terms of Sino-British trade, I think both sides have seen the light. Both China and Britain have good intentions and have taken numerous measures in recent months to strengthen bilateral trade relations. The 48 Group Club is also taking the initiative in trade with China. We do this because the Chinese market is vast and has great potential; China’s policy of reform and opening up is conducive to economic and trade development; it is also because the 6-year trade plan for the 1990s between China and Britain provides “unprecedented opportunities” for British companies to develop trade with China.

Mr. Blake confidently said: “In my opinion, Sino-British trade should double in the next decade, and the 48 Group Club should do more than double.” “The world is vast and full of opportunities.” History and reality have repeatedly proven that the far-sighted individuals of the 48 Group Club have persisted in developing trade with China, showing the high vision of the icebreaker.

### “破冰者”的眼光——访英国48家集团顾问庭伯莱克先生

    “破冰者”的眼光
    ——访英国48家集团顾问庭伯莱克先生
    本报记者　陈特安
    9月15日下午，记者来到伦敦罗斯伯里大街英国48家集团总部访问了该集团顾问、中国人民的老朋友庭伯莱克先生。二楼客厅简朴、明亮。庭伯莱克先生就在这里热情接待我。这位老顾问三十五年如一日，一直从事英中贸易。庭伯莱克已近20次访华，足迹遍及中华大地，最近又刚刚结束他半个多月的中国之行，我们的话题就从这里开始。
    “40年来，中国已今非昔比，变化巨大”，庭伯莱克先生说，“别的且不论，就拿中国对外贸易来说，五十年代中期，记得中国的对外贸易总额仅为10至20亿美元，如今已高达1000亿美元以上”。他稍停顿后，继续兴致勃勃地谈起他最近的中国之行：“尤其近十年来，中国人民在住房、衣着等方面，更有着明显的改善。”“社会主义国家中，在把灵活性引进计划经济体制方面，中国是一个先锋”。他由衷相信在不同经济思想间，能找出一种适合中国国情的解决办法。
    48家集团中像庭伯莱克这样的一批中国人民的老朋友对中国充满信心，远非今日始。当记者问及48家集团为何能成为西方发展对华贸易的“破冰者”时，庭伯莱克说：关键也就在于48家集团对中国的经济发展和市场潜力充满信心。五十年代初，共和国还在摇篮里的艰苦岁月，西方大多数国家对中国实行“贸易禁运”，英国一批有识之士顶住一切外来压力，组成一个有16家公司参加的第一个西方贸易代表团，毅然于1953年6月访华，达成第一个“中英贸易安排”，“凿破了西方‘禁运’的冰层”。因此，这个代表团一直被誉为“破冰者”代表团。翌年4月，为反对禁运，拓展对华贸易，他们在伦敦成立有48家公司参加的“英国对华贸易48家集团”。五十年代末到六十年代，48家集团坚持反对西方对从中国进口和向中国出口技术等方面的“完全不公正的限制和歧视”，“打破了又一层冰层。”此后，48家集团还一直在为“中国得到非欧洲共同体国家同等待遇”而斗争。
    今年夏天，西方国家对华关系一度出现的气氛被视为另一种‘冰’，他接着说：“虽然没有禁运，但它已在贸易道路上设下了许多障碍”，“48家集团在这种局势面前，态度是非常清楚的：我们同中国贸易的基础没有任何改变”。他认为，如果损坏了这一基础，那将是“两国商界和两国人民的莫大损失”。
    于是，48家集团照例顶住了重重压力，决然于8月组团访华，并将于10月下半月组成70人的代表团，分组访问北京、天津、沈阳等城市。48家集团已同中国七个省签订了总值达54亿美元的6年贸易计划。这一切表明，48家集团要再次成为拓展对华贸易的“经济破冰者”。
    谈及开拓英中经济贸易新局面时，庭伯莱克分析说，就中英贸易而言，我认为，双方都已见到曙光。中英双方都有良好的愿望，并在近几个月里采取了大量措施来加强双边贸易关系。48家集团也正在采取对华贸易主动行动，我们所以这样做，是因为中国市场广阔，潜力很大，中国坚持改革和开放的政策有利于发展经济和贸易；也是因为中英面向90年代的6年贸易计划为英国公司开拓对华贸易提供了“不平凡的机会”。
    庭伯莱克满有信心地说：“依我看，英中贸易在下一个十年应该翻一番，48家集团应比翻一番还多。”“风物长宜放眼量。”历史和现实一再证明，48家集团的有识之士坚持发展对华贸易，是破冰者的高瞻远瞩。
