Shiling Village, located in the heart of Wuzhishan, Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County, Hainan Island, is translated as "Burning Fields" in Chinese. However, by 1984, the yield per acre in this "Burning Fields" was only 200 jin (approximately 100 kg). The Li villagers, who had once sacrificed their lives and shed blood to establish the first Soviet government in Guangdong Province, earned only 2 jiao (approximately 0.2 yuan) per labor day.

In February 1985, Wang Qingzhang, a retired cadre from the county's Water and Electricity Bureau, returned to his hometown. He was determined to leverage the advantages of mountainous regions for planting economic crops, leading the villagers out of poverty and onto the path of shared prosperity. However, when he discussed this with the villagers, everyone said they had no money. One autumn evening, after Wang Qingzhang had finished visiting homes, he returned home in the dark. Suddenly, someone ahead shouted in the Miao language, "Catch the thief!" Wang Qingzhang was startled and grabbed a shadow that was darting past him. "You, Wang Wen!..." "I have no money, I'm going to the Miao village..." the 16-year-old Wang Wen stammered.

Money! That night, Wang Qingzhang was tormented by the thought of money: he had just built a house and used up his savings and resettlement allowance; the construction of the water tower in the village was his initiative and design, and he had donated 2,000 yuan; the retirement pay he had just received was used to buy betel nut seedlings, see a doctor, and build a thatched house for the five-guarantee households, and it was all spent. What to do? He suddenly thought of the improved mango varieties being tested by the county's Tropical Crops Research Institute. At that time, the fruits were ripe, and the institute urgently needed mango seeds for breeding, welcoming people to the orchard to eat mangoes and leave seeds. The seeds left behind were not only priced by weight but could also be exchanged for mango seedlings at half price. "Hey, this is a way!" Wang Qingzhang's eyes lit up.

The next morning, Wang Qingzhang, like a wealthy benefactor, loudly shouted at the village entrance and the end of the village, "Those who have no money to buy mango seedlings, follow me to eat mangoes!" This voice, through the thin mist, reached every household. People put down their water pipes, wrapped themselves in coarse clothes, and came out of their thatched houses. Even Wang Shizhong, who had just recovered from a long illness, brought his two thin children.

The familiar person at the Tropical Crops Research Institute saw Wang Qingzhang bring a team of more than 20 people who wanted to "eat" their way to wealth, and was surprised and jokingly said, "Old Wang, to become wealthy by 'eating,' this is your great invention!" Wang Qingzhang smiled bitterly as he responded, his nose stinging with tears: If it weren't for the poor villagers, I, a person who has received 13 months of retirement pay, would make a fuss for what! But now, this must be done! In the end, hunger could not resist the invasion of mango acidity. By the time the villagers had eaten the 20th mango, they found it increasingly difficult to swallow. Wang Shizhong's two children cried out, "Dad, I've eaten 10 already, I really can't swallow anymore!" Wang Qingzhang was chewing his 17th mango, hearing the children's words, his heart ached as he quickly turned his face to the side...

The sun was about to set in the west. When the villagers were about to carry baskets of mango seedlings back home, the institute calculated that there were fewer seeds and more seedlings, and they needed to pay more. However, more than 20 people searched their pockets and found not a single coin. It was a pity to carry fewer seedlings after walking such a long way from the mountains.

Thus, under Wang Qingzhang's leadership, the men gritted their teeth, tightened their belts, and endured the acidity in their stomachs, unloading a car of four tons of mango seedlings for the Tropical Crops Research Institute and loading a car of four tons of rubber seedlings. Only then did they barely manage to make up the difference.

The setting sun pressed heavily on the mountain pass. The women and children waiting at the edge of Shiling Village watched the shadows of more than 20 people carrying baskets winding along the terrace ridges in the glorious afterglow...

In this way, under Wang Qingzhang's leadership, starting from a rare "mango banquet," they carried the young, supported the poor, dragged the sick, and persuaded the lazy, slowly turning onto the broad road of commercial economic prosperity. In five years, every household in the village had contracted barren mountains and land to plant economic crops.

The once impoverished Wang Shizhong became a household with more than 600 rubber trees, 5,000 benefit trees, and an annual harvest of more than 2,700 jin of pineapples. As for the young man Wang Wen, who once went to the Miao village to "make a fortune," he alone is the owner of more than 20 acres of 700 rubber trees.

According to incomplete statistics, from the village to the edge of the village, the top of the red stone peak, the entire village has reclaimed nearly 3,000 acres of wasteland, planting 1,105 acres of rubber, 640 acres of pineapple, 772 acres of benefit trees, betel nut, mango, lychee, coconut, peach, and other fruits in front of and behind the houses, with an estimated 300 acres. Each household averages 60 acres of contracted wasteland. The annual income per household was only over 200 yuan in 1985, reaching nearly 600 yuan in 1987.

It is estimated that in three years, the annual income per household will enter the five-digit range. At that time, the "Burning Fields" will hold a lively and bustling "Peach Banquet"!

### 苦涩的黎山“芒果宴”

　　苦涩的黎山“芒果宴”
　　吴名辉　王平（黎族）
    位于海南岛五指山腹地的保亭黎族苗族自冶县什铃镇什夏村，汉语译意是“火热的田园”。但至1984年，这个“火热的田园”亩产仅两百斤，曾为建立广东省第一个苏维埃政权抛过头颅、洒过鲜血的黎村人，每个劳动日才值两毛钱。
    1985年2月，从县水电局离休的老干部王庆章，回到了这个生他养他的村庄，下决心发挥山区种植经济作物的优势，带领村民们摆脱贫困，走共同富裕的道路。但与乡亲们一鼓捣，家家都说没钱。那年秋天的一个晚上，王庆章刚串完门，摸黑回家。突然，前头有人操苗语大嚷：“抓贼啊！”王庆章一惊，顺手牵住一个闪向自己一旁的黑影：“你，王文！……”“我没钱，到苗村去……”16岁的王文狼狈地说。
    钱！这一晚，王庆章一直在“钱锅”中煎熬：自己刚建完房子用去了存款和安家费；村里筑自来水塔，是自己倡导和设计的，也捐出两千元；这几个月的退休金刚发下，给五保户买槟榔苗、看医生、搭茅屋等，也用光了。怎么办呢？他忽然想到县热作所试验的良种芒果。此时果儿正熟，所里急需芒果核当种培育，欢迎人们到果园去吃芒果留核，留下的果核不仅按斤论价，而且可以减半价换芒果苗。“嘿，这可是条路！”王庆章眼前一亮。
    次日晨，王庆章像个大财神似的在村头寨尾大声吆喝：“没钱买芒果苗的，都跟我去吃芒果啊！”这声音透过薄薄的雾霭，传到家家户户。人们纷纷放下水烟筒，披上件粗衣，从茅屋里钻了出来。连久病刚愈的王世忠，也带上两个瘦骨如柴的孩子。
    热作所的熟人，见王庆章带来二十几个想靠
  “吃”来致富的队伍，惊讶之余便打趣着说：“王老，靠‘吃’致富，可是你的一大发明啊！”王庆章一面苦笑着应酬，一面鼻子直发酸：要不是为了穷乡亲，我这领13个月离休金的人出什么风头哟！可眼下不这样做不行呀！到底是饥肠咕噜抵不住芒果酸的侵袭，山民们吃到第20个芒果时，却越吃越艰难起来。王世忠那两个孩子直嚷嚷：“爸，我都吃10个了，实在咽不下啦！”王庆章正强嚼着第17个芒果，听到孩子们的话，他心酸得忙把脸转向一边……
    太阳快偏西了，当山民们正要挑着一担担芒果苗回家时，人家算了算，核少苗多，要补钱。可二十几个人遍翻口袋也掏不出半文，打老远的山路来，少挑几棵种苗又太可惜。
    于是，汉子们又在王庆章的带领下，狠咬牙关，勒紧腰带，硬是撑着一肚子的芒果酸，给热作所卸下一车四吨芒果苗，又装上一车四吨橡胶苗，这才勉强作了抵押充了数。
    夕阳重重地压在了山口，等在什夏村边的女人和孩子们，看着在灿烂的余晖中，逶迤于梯田埂上的二十几个挑担的影子……
    就这样，在王庆章的带领下，从一餐世间罕见的“芒果宴”开始，携着小的，扶着贫的，拖着病的，劝着懒的，慢慢地拐上了商品经济致富的康庄大道。五年时间里，全村每户都承包了荒山荒地种植经济作物。
    那位贫病交加的王世忠，也成了拥有橡胶600多棵，益智5000多株，年获菠萝2700多斤的脱贫户。至于曾到苗寨去“发迹”的小青年王文，一人就是二十来亩700余棵橡胶的大业主。
    据不完全统计，从村里到村边的红石峰顶上，全村共垦荒近3000亩，种植橡胶1105亩，菠萝640亩，益智772亩，槟榔、芒果、荔枝、椰子、洋桃，在房前屋后，无处不是，约计300多亩。每户平均承包荒地60亩。全村人年均收入1985年仅200多元，1987年达近600元。
    预计三年以后，户年均收入将进入五位数。到那时，火热的田园里举行的将是红红火火、热热闹闹的“蟠桃宴”！
