On the grasslands of Bariku in Xinjiang, if you ask a Kazakh herdsman to tame a wild horse, he can be riding the sweating horse within a meal's time. If you ask him to catch a mountain goat from a cliff, he can be as agile as an eagle, catching it with ease. However, if you ask him to carry a bucket of surplus yogurt to the bazaar to sell, even if you whip him, he won't do it.

However, under the gentle breeze of reform, a Kazakh woman has lifted her veil and gone into business!

Zhamaria, 36, lives in Sujite Village, Shalchuk Township. She is a mother of five. Before 1983, like millions of Kazakh women on the grasslands, she spent her days around the tea kettle. The family of seven relied on her husband's single income, making life very difficult. Later, she heard from the radio that the government allowed individual businesses, and her husband, Kaditi Han, a Communist Party member, also encouraged her to open a small grocery store. Zhamaria said, "Old Kazakh people do not do business, how can we break this rule?" Kaditi Han said, "What the government advocates, you can do with peace of mind."

With the support of village cadres, she sold one of her family's horses and borrowed 500 yuan to open the first woman-owned shop on the grasslands, "Yimin Store." On the first day of standing at the counter, her heart pounded, and her face flushed. She had her husband stand by her side for courage. The first customer was an old herdsman who bought a brick of tea. She blushed and lowered her head, not daring to ask for money. The old man himself went to the township supply and marketing cooperative to find out the price and voluntarily handed the money to her. The next day, the township cadres came to the village for a meeting and heard that she had opened a store, all of them rushed over, each buying 2 yuan worth of goods. She knew in her heart that they were buying to encourage her.

Zhamaria said that the turnover of her "Yimin Store" increased every year, and her income also rose steadily. In 1983, the family's per capita income was 523 yuan, which increased to 1620 yuan last year. The yurt was furnished with a television and furniture, and the whole family had new clothes. In March this year, she also invested 1000 yuan in the village primary school. Zhamaria stepping out of the yurt to do business has opened the eyes of the surrounding herdsmen. Now, there are 103 households of herdsmen doing business in Shalchuk Township, not only selling daily necessities but also opening restaurants, engaging in woodwork, repair, and garment processing...

The herdsmen's business, though just starting, has brought many benefits to the grasslands. In the past, surplus milk was discarded, and sheep bones, intestines, and other livestock products were thrown away. The girls' woven carpets and embroidered towels were only for home use or gifts to relatives and friends. Now, they can all be sold as commodities and turned into money.

The herdsmen's lives have changed greatly. Things like trendy piano-style furniture, beer, champagne, chocolate, color TVs, and tape recorders have all entered the yurts.

Isn't it said that "without commerce, there is no life"? The Kazakh herdsmen have entered the ranks of business, and the ancient grasslands have come to life.

    撩开面纱走出去
    蓝学毅
    在新疆巴里坤草原上，要是让哈萨克牧民去驯服一匹烈马，不消一顿饭功夫，他就能骑上热汗淋淋的马背；若让他去悬崖峭崖抓回一只山羊，他可以像山鹰一般矫健，手到擒来。但是，你要让他把一桶吃不了的羊奶拎到巴扎（集市）上去叫卖，就是用鞭子抽，他也不会去干。
    然而，在改革春风的吹拂下，竟有一位哈萨克族妇女撩开面纱去经商了！
    36岁的扎玛丽亚家住沙尔乔克乡苏吉特村，已是5个孩子的母亲。1983年以前，她同草原上千万个哈萨克族妇女一样，整天围着奶茶锅子转。全家7口人全靠丈夫一个劳力的收入过活，日子很艰难。后来，从广播里听到政府允许个体经营，她丈夫卡德提汉是共产党员，也鼓励她出来开个小杂货店。扎玛丽亚说：“老一辈的哈萨克人都不经商，我们怎能破这个规矩？”卡德提汉说：“政府提倡的事就放心去干好了。”
    在村干部支持下，她卖掉了自家的一匹马，又贷款500元，就办起了草原上第一家由女人经营的商店“益民门市部”。第一天站柜台，她的心儿咚咚跳，脸皮儿阵阵发烧，就拉上男人站在身边壮胆。第一个进门买东西的是位老牧人，买了一块砖茶，她羞红着脸低着头不敢张口要钱。老人自己跑到乡供销社去问清了价，主动把钱交给了她。第二天乡里干部来村上开会，听说她开了商店，都纷纷跑来，每人买了2元钱的东西。她心里明白，他们是为了鼓励她才故意买的。
    扎玛丽亚说，她的“益民门市部”营业额逐年都有增加，收入也不断提高。1983年全家人均收入523元，到去年上升到1620元。毡房里添置了电视机和家具，全家人都有了新衣服，今年3月还给村小学投资1000元。扎玛丽亚走出毡房去经商，让四周的牧民开了眼界。现在，沙尔乔克乡牧民经商户已发展到103户，除了经营日用百货，还有开饭馆的，从事木器加工、修理、服装加工的……牧民经商，虽说刚刚起步，却已给草原带来很多好处。过去奶子喝不了就倒掉了，一些羊骨、肠衣等畜产品随地乱抛，姑娘们织的花毡，绣的织巾只供自家用或赠送亲友，现在都能作为商品变成钱。
    牧民的生活发生了很大的变化，什么钢琴式的新潮家具，什么啤酒、香槟、巧克力，什么彩电、收录机，也都涌进了毡房。
    不是说“无商不活”吗？哈萨克牧民走进了经商行列，古老的草原就活泛起来了。
