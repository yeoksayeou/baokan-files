Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 21st.

To stop the riots in the U.S. territory of the Virgin Islands, the U.S. military began urgently dispatching 16 C-141 transport aircraft from last night, carrying over 1,000 fully armed soldiers to suppress the riots and maintain order.

The U.S. Virgin Islands, located in the Caribbean, has over 100,000 residents. According to U.S. news media reports, the main cause of the riots is the food shortage that occurred after the islands were hit by a severe hurricane. Local residents, including some police officers, rushed to loot food from stores. Additionally, there were several shootings and incidents of harassing tourists.

A Pentagon spokesman said that if the situation worsens, more troops will be sent to the Virgin Islands. The soldiers sent to maintain order on the island will have the authority to open fire on those who resist.

    美派兵镇压维尔京群岛骚乱
    新华社华盛顿9月21日电　为了制止美国属地维尔京群岛上发生的骚乱，美国军方从昨天深夜起，紧急出动了16架C—141运输机，运送1000多名全副武装的军人前往镇压，维持秩序。
    位于加勒比海的美属维尔京群岛有10万多居民。据美国新闻媒介报道，骚乱的主要原因是这个群岛在受到强烈飓风袭击后出现食品短缺，当地居民，包括一些军警，纷纷哄抢商店中的食品。另外，还发生了一些枪击和骚扰游客的事件。
    一位国防部发言人说，一旦局势恶化，将增派更多部队去维尔京群岛。派往该岛维持治安的军人将有权向违抗者开枪。
