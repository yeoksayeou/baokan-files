In the forty years since the founding of the nation, China's food industry has undergone tremendous changes. The total industrial output value of the food industry has risen to the third position among all sectors of the national economy, becoming a pillar industry of China's economy.

Especially in the ten years since the reform and opening up, the food industry has entered a golden age of development. According to statistics from relevant departments, the food industry has grown by 2.77 times in ten years; in 1988, the industrial output value reached 13.0567 billion yuan.

It is reported that China's food industry system has basically taken shape. Food manufacturing, beverage manufacturing, tobacco processing, and salt production have become the four major pillar industries of the food sector. Industries such as grain processing, oil processing, meat processing, sugar making, salt production, brewing, tobacco, canning, dairy products, non-alcoholic beverages, confectionery, baked goods, condiments, and new fermentation have all developed rapidly. Industries supporting the food industry, such as food additives, food packaging, food machinery, and research, have also taken initial shape. A comprehensive and coordinated food industry has become one of the pillar industries of the national economy.
