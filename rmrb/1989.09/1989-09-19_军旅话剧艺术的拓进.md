When Chinese theater was still in a "low ebb" and the impact of the commercial economy on theater art had not yet been fully addressed, military theater artists were quietly making innovative strides. Just from the five major plays presented at the national military arts festival, significant progress has been made in themes, character development, and exploration of performance forms.

Looking back at the development of military theater in the new era, we can see that the effort to excavate the tragic history of the people's revolutionary war has always been an important pursuit for military theater artists. Plays like "Chen Yi Comes Out of the Mountains," "Northward March," "The Great Kunlun," and "The Battle of Huaihai" have shown the artistic direction of revolutionary historical themes in theater. Starting from this high point, the General Political Department Theater Troupe's production of "China—1949" (hereafter referred to as "China") had to seek a new aesthetic perspective to view the changes in history, enriching the new content of revolutionary historical themes in theater art. "China" focuses on the major historical event of the founding of New China. However, it does not narrate the specific process of the founding of New China from beginning to end. Instead, it captures a few life fragments that are not major but are intrinsically linked to the overall historical process within this broad historical context, focusing on the portrayal of the collective image of leaders such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Ren Bishi. This approach of transcending the theme and structuring it around people breaks away from the previous model of event narration and spiritual illustration in similar themes, expanding the capacity and aesthetic content of historical life. In portraying the images of the leaders, "China" insists on using emotions to weave the historical activities of the leaders and using detailed depictions to showcase the distinct and unique personalities of the leaders. The repeated appearances of the symbolic "boatmen" in the play create a distant and solemn historical atmosphere, conveying the profound philosophical meaning that the people are the true creators of history. However, it is worth pondering that the details of Mao Zedong and others lying on the ground in the first scene and Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai carrying Aunt Zhang in the final scene, due to the director's excessive pursuit of artistic effects, make one feel somewhat unbelievable. The director's good intentions are understandable, but it is not unreasonable to demand a sense of proportion in artistic embellishment. I believe that how to maintain a high degree of unity between historical truth and artistic truth is an important issue that cannot be ignored in the developing revolutionary historical theme theater art.

If "China" has made a useful attempt in portraying the collective image of leaders and creating a unique artistic style for historical dramas, then the Academy of Military Arts' production of "A Cluster of Sacred Fire in the Distance" (hereafter referred to as "Fire") delves deeply into the life of the military camp during a historical turning point. In the complex social phenomena of the great transformation era and the intertwined desolate and tragic atmosphere of the vast northwest, it successfully portrays Blue Grass, a contemporary soldier with a rich inner world and complex personality. "Fire" breaks away from the previous pattern of writing about heroic deeds and mainly depicts the existence and activities of ordinary soldiers' inner worlds in a peaceful environment, deeply showcasing the unique personality and arduous spiritual journey of the characters, moving closer to the reality of military life and the authenticity of soldiers' images. The main character, Blue Grass, comes from a poor peasant family. He loyally guards the border in the vast and desolate Gobi Desert, but he also yearns for a comfortable life with "wife, children, and a warm bed." He longs to become a company-level officer so that his wife in the poor mountain village can follow the army soon, and for this, he often suffers from spiritual torment. Blue Grass has a high sense of political responsibility for the construction of the army, but due to his low cultural level and the long-term isolated and closed living environment, he often consciously or unconsciously adopts a rejecting attitude towards modern civilization, creating a psychological gap with the new generation of young soldiers. The spirit of dedication as a soldier and the cultural mentality as a peasant constitute Blue Grass's multi-layered and multi-faceted complex personality, making it difficult for us to limit this character with concepts of advancement or backwardness. It is a rare and innovative artistic image in the new era of military theater. In comparison, Liu Qingjian, the image of a new-generation educated soldier, seems somewhat simple and not fully fleshed out. He is a soldier that Blue Grass brought in, serving as a platoon leader, attending military academy, and then being promoted to deputy company commander. He has aspirations, modern ideas, and makes the monotonous and dull life at the sentry post vibrant. However, he also has his own troubles, such as the lamentations of his elderly mother, Blue Grass's lack of understanding, and his girlfriend Snow Swan's wavering love. Unfortunately, "Fire" portrays Liu Qingjian mainly on the surface of the character, failing to delve into the depths of his soul to reveal the twists and turns in his thoughts, giving a somewhat idealized feeling.

In recent years, many military theater artists have focused on reflecting on national culture, attempting to observe history with a contemporary perspective, providing new inspiration and enlightenment to contemporary audiences. Some have extended their thinking to the depth of social changes, national culture, and national history through reflections on contemporary military life, aiming to achieve aesthetic values that are difficult to obtain in other fields. The Navy Theater Troupe's production of "Navy Family" (hereafter referred to as "Navy") belongs to the latter category. The entire play adopts a structure that intertwines historical vertical and temporal horizontal dimensions, presenting representatives of the Chinese navy from four different periods over a hundred years ago, including Ding Ruchang of the Beiyang Fleet, an old captain of the Kuomintang navy who turned to the right, the first generation of the Chinese navy, Lu Dacai, and a young navy officer, Luo Ding, who grew up in the new era. Characters are not limited by time and space, directly communicating, merging history with reality. On the horizontal cross-section of our era, it presents the complex scenes of rapid changes in economy, politics, culture, and social life, revealing the strong shocks caused by the tide of reform and opening up in the military camp through the conflicts between Luo Ding and his father's personalities and the differences in cognition between him and his wife. It is worth praising that "Navy" does not, like some previous plays reflecting the reality of the navy, confine its artistic efforts to the sea, ships, and islands. Instead, it boldly steps into history and society, then from the historical and social "general" to penetrate the "special" of the navy camp, creating the images of two commanding officers of the new Chinese navy, Lu Dacai and Luo Ding, with distinct personalities. Relatively speaking, Lu Dacai's image is more fleshed out. The "Navy" describes Luo Ding mainly through his personality conflicts with his wife, Xu Jumei. However, unexpectedly, the insertion of Chen Ge, the "third party," caused the conflict that should have developed towards the depths of social change to return to the small circle of marital understanding, making the character lack deep thought content. The final naval battle also satisfies the superficial treatment of characters' heroicism and shallow optimism, damaging the artistic charm that "Navy" should have produced. I would like to point out that "Navy" appropriately and skillfully uses the naval band, sometimes as an iron fortress, sometimes as rolling waves, sometimes as characters in the play, and sometimes as a symbol of the times. The rhythm of straight lines and squares gives "Navy" a unique flavor.

It is obvious that "Navy" has made bold explorations in the artistic form of theater to expand the stage's expressive space and enhance the characters' historical depth. In this regard, the Air Force Theater Troupe's production of "Distant Clouds, Near Clouds" (hereafter referred to as "Distant") is even more prominent. They completely broke away from the constraints of the framed stage, creating a 360-degree circular space structure for a small theater. A white parachute is suspended at the top, like a white cloud floating in the theater sky, and a platform extending from one end of the theater in a sloping state is like a runway for a plane to take off. History and the future converge in this heaven and earth. Although "Distant" is similar to "Navy Family" in plot structure, it is also through the personal fate of a family of several generations of pilots to present the historical side of the growth and strength of the new Chinese air force. However, due to the transformation from stage to theater, the audience and actors are in the same dramatic space, making the dramatic situation presented by "Distant" no longer the concrete and direct dramatic situation of traditional drama as an object of appreciation, but rather an abstract and indirect dramatic situation that arouses the audience's participation consciousness and stimulates the audience's participation effect to a greater extent. The shortened distance between the audience and the performance makes us feel more intimate and real when watching "Distant," gaining a completely different aesthetic psychological experience from watching "Navy Family." I would like to remind the directors that "Distant" neglects the refinement and processing of life content in its pursuit of innovation. Although the stage image of Ye Jie, an old-generation soldier, is vivid, the image of the new-generation pilot is relatively pale. However, "Distant" is the first to introduce small theater art into military theater, which cannot be said to be a pioneering spirit of innovation.

The advancement of military theater art cannot be achieved in a narrow channel but must broaden the path, insisting on the diversity of themes, characters, presentation methods, and styles. The Beijing Military Region War Friend Theater Troupe's production of "Wa Huang Yu" is set against the background of the transition between old and new societies, depicting the fiery life of the people of the Taihang Mountain old revolutionary base in inheriting revolutionary traditions and facing new challenges of the times. Although this play is not directly related to the reality of the military camp, we can feel the Taihang spirit condensed in the flesh and blood of the old Eighth Route Army, old support front, and old military support, which is forged in the revolutionary fire and closely related to the history of the people's army. Compared with the previous few plays, "Wa Huang Yu" uses more realistic methods in art, concentrating, refining, and elevating the phenomena that can be seen everywhere in rural life today, transforming them into vivid, active, and diverse images, vividly depicting their different appearances, personalities, and destinies, like a thick and colorful Taihang military and civilian folk painting. As this article comes to an end, I am pleased to have watched the musical theater "Marriage Advertisement" produced by the Nanjing Military Region Frontline Theater Troupe. They integrate music art with theater art, but unlike the popular theater "Wrong Train," they pay attention to combining the entertainment form that the masses love with the cultural character of theater art itself. It can be predicted that the vigorous advancement of military theater art will bring a strong impact to the Chinese theater circle, and the difficult situation of theater will be temporary. The new dawn of the revival and development of theater art is just ahead.

    军旅话剧艺术的拓进
    西南
    当我国的话剧创作还在“低谷”徘徊的时候，当商品经济大潮对话剧艺术的冲击而引起的某种“危机”尚未消除的时候，部队的话剧艺术家们却在默默地进行着一次富有新意的攻坚，仅从全军文艺调演推出的五台大型话剧来看，在题材的开掘、人物形象的塑造以及对表演形式的探索等方面都已取得了长足的进步。
    回顾新时期军旅话剧艺术发展的过程，我们不难看到，努力发掘人民革命战争的悲壮历史，始终是部队话剧艺术家们执著追求的重要课题。像《陈毅出山》、《北上》、《巍巍昆仑》、《决战淮海》等一大批优秀剧目，已初步显示了革命历史题材的话剧创作在艺术上开拓进取的走向。在这个较高的起点上，总政话剧团创作演出的《中国——1949》（以下简称《中》剧），不得不寻求一个新的审美视角来俯视历史的风云变幻，以丰富革命历史题材话剧艺术的新的内涵。《中》剧以反映创建新中国这一重大的历史事件为主要内容。但没有从头至尾叙述新中国成立时的具体过程，而是在这个大的历史背景下，截取了几个在建国年代不算重大而又与整个历史进程有着内在关联的生活片断，着重塑造了毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、任弼时等领袖的群像。这种对题材的超越处理和以人为中心的结构方式，打破了过去同类题材的话剧只是事件铺陈和精神图解的模式，扩充了历史生活的容量和审美内涵。《中》剧在塑造领袖人物的形象时，坚持做到以情来经纬领袖人物活动的历史，以细节刻画来展示领袖人物鲜明而独特的个性。而剧中具有象征意义的“纤夫”的多次出现，则形成了悠远凝重的历史氛围，传递出人民是历史的真正创造者这一深邃的哲理意蕴。需要推敲的是，毛泽东等领袖在第一场戏中躺在地上、毛泽东和周恩来在戏的末尾抬张大娘的细节，由于编导者过份地追求艺术效果，反而使人感到有些不可信了。导演的良苦用心是不难理解的，但要求对艺术渲染的分寸感掌握适度，也不能视为苛刻。我以为，如何坚持历史的真实与艺术的真实高度统一，是处在发展中的革命历史题材话剧艺术不容忽视的一个重要问题。
    如果说《中》剧在塑造领袖群像，创造一种历史剧独特的艺术风格方面作出了有益的尝试，那么，解放军艺术学院创作演出的《天边有一簇圣火》（以下简称《天》剧），则对处于历史转折时期的当代军营生活进行了深入地开掘。在大变革时代纷纭复杂的社会现象与大西北苍凉悲壮的区域氛围的交织中，比较成功地塑造了蓝禾儿这个具有丰富的内心世界和复杂性格的当代军人形象。《天》剧一反过去专写惊天动地之举的英雄套路，而主要表现和平环境中普通军人内心世界的存在形态及活动形态，深刻地展示了人物的独特个性气质和艰难曲折的精神历程，向着军营生活的真实、军人形象的真实逼进了一步。剧中的主要人物蓝禾儿出身农民，家境贫寒，他在广袤死寂的戈壁滩上忠心耿耿地卫国戍边，但他也渴望那种“老婆孩子热炕头”的小康生活，企盼早日当上连级干部，使自己在穷山沟的妻子早日随军，为此常受到一种精神苦痛的折磨。蓝禾儿对部队建设有着高度的政治责任感，却又因自身文化素质不高以及长期生活的偏远封闭环境，使他经常自觉或不自觉地对现代文明采取了一种拒绝的态度，在心理上与新一代年轻士兵产生了隔膜。作为军人的奉献精神和作为农民的文化心态，构成了蓝禾儿多层次、多侧面的复杂性格，使我们很难用先进或落后的概念来框限这个人物，不失为新时期军旅话剧舞台上一个不多见的富有新意的艺术形象。比较起来，刘清涧这个新一代有知识的军人形象就显得有些简单而不够丰满了。他是蓝禾儿接来的兵，当排长，上军校，又提升为副连长；他有志向，观念新，把单调、平淡的哨所生活搞得红红火火。但他同样也有着自己的苦恼，如年迈老母的哀怨，蓝禾儿的不理解，恋人雪雁对爱情的动摇，等等。遗憾的是，《天》剧对刘清涧的刻画还停留于人物的表层，未能进入到人的心灵深处去展现他思想上的道道坎坷，多少给人有理想化的感觉。
    近年来，部队话剧艺术家中的不少人致力于对民族文化的思考，试图以一种当代眼光来观照历史，给当代观众以新的感染和启迪；有的则通过对当代军营生活的思考，将思维的触角延伸到社会变革和民族文化、民族历史的纵深层次，以期获得其它领域难以获得的审美价值。海军话剧团创作演出的《海军世家》（以下简称《海》剧）属于后一种类型。全剧采用了历史的纵向和时代的横向相交错的结构方式，在距我们有一百多年历史的远景上，展现了自甲午海战以来中国四个不同时期的海军代表人物，有北洋水师的丁汝昌，有弃暗投明的国民党海军老舰长，有新中国的第一代海军陆大城，有在新时期成长起来的年轻海军罗玳。人物不受时空的局限，直接对话，沟通了历史与现实的交融。在我们这个时代的横断面上，展现了在经济、政治、文化和社会生活急剧变革中的纷纭景象，通过罗玳与父亲的性格冲突和与妻子的认识差异这两组矛盾，揭示了改革、开放的大潮在军营引起的强烈震荡。值得称赞的是，
  《海》剧没有像过去一些反映海军现实生活的剧目，把自己的艺术手脚束缚在海上、舰上和岛上，而是大胆地走向历史、走向社会，然后再从历史的、社会的“一般”来洞察海军营地的
  “特殊”，塑造了陆大城、罗玳两个性格迥异的新中国海军指挥员的形象。相对来说，陆大城的形象更为丰满一些。而
  《海》剧对罗玳的描写，主要是通过他与妻子许爵美的性格冲突来完成的。但不料，中间插入了陈哥这个“第三者”，导致本来应向着社会变革的深处发展的矛盾碰撞，转而回到夫妻理解的家庭小圈子里去了，使人物性格缺乏深厚的思想内涵。而最后的海战，又满足于对人物作出表相的英雄主义和肤浅的乐观主义的处理，《海》剧本应产生的艺术魅力被损伤了。我想特别指出的是，《海》剧适度地、巧妙地运用了水兵乐队，有时是钢铁营垒，有时如滚滚波涛，有时是剧中人物，有时是时代象征，直线加方块的韵律，赋予《海》剧别有一番风味。
    显而易见，《海》剧为了扩大舞台的表现空间，增强人物的历史纵深感，对话剧的艺术形式作了大胆的探索。而在这一点上，空军话剧团创作演出的《远的云、近的云》（以下简称《远》剧）就表现得更为突出。他们彻底摆脱了框式舞台的缚束，创造了一个360度的环型空间结构的小剧场。顶端悬挂着白色降落伞，尤如一朵白云在剧场上空飘浮，剧场一端延伸出去的呈斜坡状的平台，又像是飞机升空的跑道，历史与未来都在这天地之间相汇了。尽管《远》剧在剧情结构上与《海军世家》有些相似，也是通过一个家庭几代飞行员个人的命运遭际，表现新中国空军成长壮大的历史侧面，但由于从舞台到剧场的转换，使观众与演员共处于同一个戏剧空间，《远》剧所展示的戏剧情境就不再是传统戏剧所展现的作为观赏对象的具体直接的戏剧情境，而是在更大程度唤起观众的参与意识，激发观众的参与作用的抽象间接的戏剧情境，观演距离的缩小，使我们在观赏《远》剧时更加感到演出的亲切与真实，获得了与看《海军世家》全然不同的审美心理感受。我想提醒编导者们注意的是，《远》剧在刻意求新的时候，对生活内容的提炼加工有所忽视，虽然作为老一代军人的叶戟的舞台形象是有血有肉的，但新一代飞行员的形象就比较苍白。不过，《远》剧毕竟是首次把小剧场艺术引入军旅话剧舞台，这不能不说是一种勇于开拓的创新精神。
    军旅话剧艺术的拓进，是不可能在一个狭窄的通道里所能实现的，而必须拓宽路途，坚持做到题材、人物、表现手法和风格的多样性。北京军区战友话剧团创作演出的《娲皇峪》，就是在新旧历史交替的社会背景下，表现了太行山老区人民继承革命传统、迎接新的时代挑战的火热生活。尽管这出戏与军营现实生活没有直接联系，但我们从剧中可以感受到凝聚在老八路、老支前、老拥军这些普通老百姓血肉之中的太行风骨，这种风骨正是革命战火铸造的，与人民军队的历史息息相关。与前面提到的几个剧目比较，《娲皇峪》在艺术上更多的是采用现实主义的手法，把当前农村生活中随处可见的现象集中、凝炼、提高，化为活生生的、行动着的和姿态各异的形象，维妙维肖地描绘出他们的不同面貌、性格和命运，宛如一幅浓墨重彩的太行军民风俗画。在本文就要结束的时候，笔者欣喜地观看了南京军区前线话剧团创作演出的音乐话剧《征婚启事》，他们把音乐艺术与话剧艺术熔为一体，但又不同于《搭错车》那样的通俗话剧，而是注意把广大群众喜闻乐见的娱乐形式与话剧艺术自身的文化品格结合起来。可以预料，军旅话剧艺术奋发进取的势头，必将给我国的话剧界带来强有力的冲击，话剧困窘的局面是暂时的，话剧艺术得以振兴发展的新曙光就在前头。
