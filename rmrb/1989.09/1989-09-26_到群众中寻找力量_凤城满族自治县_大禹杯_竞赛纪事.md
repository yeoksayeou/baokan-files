In 1985, an unprecedented flood swept across Liaoning Province, destroying 24 million mu of crops, causing a loss of 5 billion jin of grain, and damaging property worth several billion yuan. After the flood, Liaoning once again launched a wave of agricultural water conservancy construction. A rallying call for this large-scale mass movement was the "Great Yu Cup" competition.

The "Great Yu Cup" competition originated in Fengcheng Manchu Autonomous County.

It was also in that frightening year of 1985 when heavy rains transformed Fengcheng's mountainous areas in an instant. Post-disaster statistics showed that 70% of the county's water conservancy facilities were destroyed, 10,000 households were affected, 36 people died, 10,000 mu of land were washed away, and the direct economic loss amounted to 158 million yuan.

Would the repair of the flood-damaged projects rely solely on state relief? The county party committee and government thought of the ancient sage Yu the Great. In the early days of civilization, where were the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Water Resources? They still managed to control the floods. Ultimately, overcoming nature depends on one's own strength, and the masses must be organized.

After a period of preparation, in early 1987, when it was still cold, the "Great Yu Cup" competition was proposed. Millions of farmers, under this call, took to the water conservancy battlefields.

To date, the competition has been held for three sessions, and the farmers of the entire county have been mobilized. During this period, at the county, township, village, and team levels, each level had its own projects, ensuring that the county and townships each managed a model river, villages treated a river, and teams built a ditch. At its peak, up to 80,000 people were mobilized. Over three years, a total of 29.78 million man-days of labor, 386,000 machine-days, and 12.98 million yuan of funds were invested. A total of 18.49 million cubic meters of earth and stone were moved, 376 river sections were treated, 1,118 kilometers of dikes were built, 1.4 million mu of mountains were reforested, 250,000 mu of barren mountains were afforested, and 14.32 million willow trees were planted along the banks. Now, walking through the fields and mountains of Fengcheng, all of the above will testify to the power of self-reliance!

Success is preliminary, but the benefits brought by relying on the masses are clearly visible. The water conservancy facilities destroyed in 1985 have been fully repaired, and the flood control capacity of large, medium, and small rivers has been improved (this alone, if relying on state funding, would take 20 years to achieve). The phenomenon of severe soil erosion has also been initially addressed in this activity.

On July 18 of this year, another once-in-a-decade flood struck Fengcheng, with 123 millimeters of rain falling in one hour. Although there were losses, they were much smaller compared to 1985. The masses told the cadres who came to inspect the work: "It's all thanks to the 'Great Yu Cup' of the past few years!"

The masses need to be organized by the Party and the government to unleash their strength and achieve something. After the flood, the leaders of the county party committee and government calmed down, and the past and present of Fengcheng were laid out before them: the forest coverage had decreased from 47.7% in the early days of the country's founding to 34%; the area of soil erosion had increased from 22% to 31.7%; between 1960 and 1985, there were 14 floods, large and small, including 5 floods in the 9 years from 1977 to 1986; there were 1.23 million mu of arable land at the beginning of the country's founding, now only 810,000 mu remain, a decrease of 320,000 mu.

Obviously, in the face of history and reality, if the leaders do nothing in organizing the masses, the 600,000 people of Fengcheng will have to follow and live in poverty and misfortune; conversely, if the masses are well led to transform nature and build their homes, a beautiful and prosperous Fengcheng will emerge.

It is this sense of responsibility and mission that has made the Fengcheng County Party Committee and government determined to lead the masses in controlling mountains and rivers.

The county party committee played a core leadership role. The county established a command center, with the secretary and the county magistrate serving as the overall commanders. Secretary Miao Weili said that it makes a big difference whether the party organization takes the lead or not, and the same is true below the county level.

At the beginning of the "Great Yu Cup" competition, the county party committee and government clearly proposed that scientific management must be insisted on, and engineering benefits must be emphasized; no "window dressing" or "red flag waving" should be done, and the principle of "who benefits, who manages" should be adhered to. "Four modernizations" were their specific requirements.

Planning for the basin. That is, in the planning, consider the upstream and downstream, left and right banks; consider the control of mountains and rivers; consider the ecological, economic, and social benefits. The five-year plan formulated by the county has been legislated by the county people's congress, thus maintaining seriousness and continuity. Whoever comes will follow the plan, and will not do "excavate when Secretary Zhang comes and fill when Secretary Li comes."

Engineering standardization. Proposed that river treatment projects should not be accepted if the upstream does not close the mountain and ditch, there are no water and soil conservation measures; if the sand and soil dikes have no reinforcement and supporting measures; if there are no biological measures; if there is no management system and team; if there are no two maps (current status map, planning map) and one book (design explanation book).

Comprehensive measures and networked treatment. Proposed to achieve "four combinations," that is, water and soil conservation treatment with river treatment; engineering measures with biological measures; elimination of flood obstacles with river treatment projects; construction with management. In the organizational implementation, each level has its own projects, and different tasks are determined according to different seasons and stages, forming a network.

Systematic engineering awareness is a prominent progress in Fengcheng's "Great Yu Cup" competition. But this is not enough, it is also necessary to consider the long-term and immediate interests of the masses, so that water conservancy projects can be combined with the immediate interests of farmers as much as possible, and solve problems that are closely related to the interests of the masses. For example, in some places in Fengcheng, the groundwater level is low, and some places have harmful substances such as fluorine in the groundwater. During the water treatment process, solving some drinking water problems for people and livestock was welcomed by the farmers.

To further promote the water control activities, Fengcheng Manchu Autonomous County timely proposed the "Forest Cup" competition, which is a deepening of the "Great Yu Cup," a specific measure to treat the mountains, upstream and downstream, and the present and future together. The "double cup" competition will be combined with several base constructions and courtyard economy constructions, undoubtedly, in a few years, the appearance of Fengcheng will become even more beautiful!

    到群众中寻找力量
    ——凤城满族自治县“大禹杯”竞赛纪事
    本报记者　何加正
    1985年，一场罕见的洪灾席卷辽宁大地，冲坏2400万亩庄稼，损失50亿公斤粮食，几十亿元财产……洪水之后，辽宁重又兴起农田水利建设的浪潮。推动这次大规模群众运动的一个具有鼓动性的号召是，开展“大禹杯”竞赛。
    说起“大禹杯”，不能不说说它的发端地——凤城满族自治县。
    也是在那个令人胆寒的1985年，暴雨使凤城的山乡在顷刻之间变了样。灾后统计，全县70％的水利设施被毁，一万户房屋受灾，36人死亡，一万亩土地冲失，直接经济损失1.58亿元。
    修复水毁工程，全指望着国家救济吗？县委、县政府想到了先人大禹。在洪荒初开的时代，哪来的财政部、水利部？不是一样治水？战胜自然归根到底得靠自己的力量，得把群众组织起来。
    经过一段时间酝酿，1987年初，还是天寒地冻的时刻，“大禹杯”竞赛提出来了。千万农民在这一号召鼓动下走上了水利战场。
    距今，竞赛已进行了三届，全县农民被发动起来了。其间，县、乡、村、组，各级都有自己的工程，做到县、乡都抓一条样板河，村治一条河，组闸一条沟。高潮时期，最多的有8万人上阵。3年来，共投人工2978万个，车工38.6万个台日，资金1298万元，完成土石方1849万立米，治理中小河道376条段，筑堤1118公里。同时，封山育林140万亩，荒山造林25万亩，堤岸插柳1432万株。如今走进凤城的田野山川，上述的一切会向你证明自力更生的力量！
    成功是初步的，但依靠群众带来的效益却明显可见。1985年被毁的水利设施已全部修复，而且提高了大中小河流的抗洪能力（仅此一项，如果光靠国家给钱20年也难做到）。水土流失严重的现象，在这次活动中也初步得到解决。
    今年7月18日，又一场几十年不遇的洪灾降临凤城，1小时降雨123毫米，损失虽有，但比起1985年来，要小得多。群众对前来检查工作的干部说：“多亏这几年的‘大禹杯’呀！”
    群众要靠党和政府去组织，才能发挥力量，有所作为。洪水过后，县委和县政府领导人冷静下来，凤城的过去和现状呈现在面前：森林覆盖面已由建国初期的47.7％下降到34％；水土流失面由22％增加到31.7％；1960年到1985年25年间，发生大小洪灾14次，其中1977年到1986年9年就发生5次；建国初有123万亩耕地，现在仅有81万亩，减少耕地32万亩。
    显然，在历史和现实面前，如果领导者在组织群众方面无所作为，60万凤城人就要跟着守穷和倒霉；反之，如果很好地带领群众改造自然，建设家园，就会有一个美丽而富足的凤城出现。
    正是这种责任感和使命感，使得凤城县委和县政府下决心带领群众治山治水。
    县委发挥了核心领导作用。县里成立了指挥部，书记和县长都是总指挥。书记苗维利说，党组织出面不出面大不一样，县以下同样离不开党的坚强领导。
    “大禹杯”竞赛开展之初，县委、县政府就明确提出，必须坚持科学治理，讲求工程效益；不搞“花架子”，不搞红旗招展那一套，并坚持谁受益谁治理的原则。“四化”是他们提出的具体要求。
    规划流域化。即在规划中兼顾上下游、左右岸；兼顾治山、治水；兼顾生态、经济、社会三个效益。县里制定的五年规划已通过县人大立法，这样保持了严肃性、连续性。谁来谁去，都按规划进行，不搞“张书记来了挖，李书记来了填”。
    工程标准化。提出治河工程“五不验收”：上游不封山、不闸沟，没有水土保持措施不验收；沙土堤防没有加固配套措施不验收；生物措施不配套不验收；没有管护制度和队伍不验收；没有工程设计两张图（现状图、规划图）一本书（设计说明书）不验收。
    措施综合化和整治网络化。提出要做到“四结合”，即水土保持治理与河道治理相结合；工程措施与生物措施相结合；消除行洪障碍与治河工程相结合；建设与管护相结合。在组织实施中，各级都有自己的工程，根据不同季节、不同阶段确定不同任务，形成一张网络。
    系统工程意识，是凤城“大禹杯”竞赛中一个突出的进步。但这还不够，还必须考虑到群众的长远利益和眼前利益，做到水利工程尽量和农民的当前利益相结合，解决关系群众的切身利益的问题。如凤城一些地方地下水位低，还有些地方地下水中含氟和其他有害物质。在治水过程中，解决一些人、畜饮水问题，受到农民欢迎。
    为了把治水活动推向深入，凤城满族自治县又不失时机地提出了“兴林杯”竞赛，这是“大禹杯”的深入，是山上山下、上游下游、眼前和长远一起治的具体措施。“双杯”竞赛将和几个基地建设、庭院经济建设相结合，无疑，再过几年，凤城的面貌将变得更加美丽！
