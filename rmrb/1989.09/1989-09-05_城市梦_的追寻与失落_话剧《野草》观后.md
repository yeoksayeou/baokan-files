The play "Wild Grass," created and performed by the Qiqihar Drama Troupe, has brought a jolt to the "Swansong" arts festival in Heilongjiang with its realistic style that confronts life and reveals human destiny.

The story is set against the backdrop of the reform era's commodity economy, depicting the journey of rural migrants, particularly their representative, the protagonist Lao Si, who came from a remote village to "fight their way east" in Heilongjiang. It vividly portrays the twists and turns, hardships, and costs experienced by Chinese rural youth in their quest for urbanization and modern civilization: they are either assimilated and dissolved by urban civilization or remain excluded from the city, forced to return to their former lands. This is a painful, confused, and bitter process of choice and being chosen.

Lao Si is an exceptional figure among the migrants. He seems to be a strong person. When their wages were arbitrarily withheld and there was no recourse for complaint, Lao Si, alone and desperate, used a kitchen knife to seize back the money for everyone. He could have used this money to redeem his childhood sweetheart, Erqin, but for the sake of his fellow villagers, he gave up this chance to fulfill his own love and happiness, using the money to find a way for everyone to survive in the city. With his daring, righteousness, generosity, and quick wit, he replaced the former tyrannical and selfish Uncle Qi, becoming the backbone of the migrants and gradually transforming himself into a famous "peasant entrepreneur." However, this seemingly strong individual is also fragile. His later "achievements" relied on his marriage to a "city girl" with a limp. To become a "city dweller," he sacrificed his love, but ultimately, he was sent to the dock as a scapegoat when his patron fell, and his dream of becoming a city dweller was ruthlessly shattered. People found that Lao Si's spiritual world remained barren despite his rise to fame. He never developed an independent personality. Material abundance at most satisfied his vanity but did not change his spiritual outlook.

The play does not simply make a moral judgment on Lao Si's character. In reality, Lao Si symbolizes a person who appears to have conscious and proactive actions but is fundamentally passive and negative, manipulated and toyed with by immense historical inertia. As a rural youth and a wandering migrant, Lao Si's dream of becoming a city dweller is natural and blameless. The problem lies in the fact that Lao Si has many traits of Ah Q: he indulges in women, flaunts his wealth, and has the airs of a nouveau riche. Although he entered the city, his entire mindset, demeanor, and behavior remained far from modern civilization. His tragedy is not in losing Erqin or choosing the wrong wife but in his all-or-nothing gambling mentality and his worship and pursuit of a civilized society. Of course, the innate flaws in Lao Si's character stem from the complex social and cultural environment. In this sense, Lao Si's tragic fate can inspire a deeper understanding of the difficulties of reform.

As a work of realism, "Wild Grass" is quite successful in its portrayal of characters' personalities, traits, and psychology, as well as its stage presentation. Lao Si's complex emotions towards Erqin, his inability to love or let go, are depicted with layers and depth; Erqin's deep, pure love for Lao Si and her conflicted, struggling nature between her strong will and her pure love for Lao Si are also vividly portrayed.

In the end, Lao Si walks towards the court, while Erqin and the brothers who followed Lao Si, like a flock of geese without a leader, leave the city where they had shed so many tears and sweat, returning to their homeland. Were they initially wild grass, only to return to being wild grass in the end? "Wildfires cannot burn them out, spring winds blow them back to life." The urban dream of a migrant rises and fades. Perhaps it is precisely because of these countless cycles of birth and death, of dying and resiliently reviving, that our society gradually moves from the classical to the modern, from ignorance to civilization.

    “城市梦”的追寻与失落
    ——话剧《野草》观后
    包临轩
    齐齐哈尔话剧团创作并演出的话剧《野草》，以其直面生活、揭示人生命运的写实主义风格，给黑龙江“天鹅之声”艺术节带来了一股冲击力。
    故事以改革年代的商品经济社会为背景，表现了从穷乡僻壤来黑龙江“闯关东”的盲流，特别是他们的代表、剧中主人公老四坎坷的人生道路及其起伏跌宕的心路历程，让我们强烈地感受到中国青年农民在走向城市化、迎接现代文明过程中的曲折、艰难与代价：要么被城市文明所同化、消解；要么继续被城市拒之门外，重新回到昔日的土地。这是一个饱含痛苦、迷惘、辛酸的选择与被选择的过程。
    老四是盲流中出类拔萃的人物，他似乎是一个强者，在工钱被无端克扣，投诉无门的情况下，老四单枪匹马，铤而走险，用一把菜刀劫回了大伙的钱。他本可以用这笔钱赎回青梅竹马的恋人二芹，但是为了一块出来的兄弟乡亲，他放弃了这个能成全自己爱情、幸福的机会，用这笔钱给大伙在城市找到了生路。他以自己的果敢、仗义、宽宏和机敏，取代了原来那个蛮横、自私的七叔，成为盲流们的主心骨，并逐步使自己成为一个名声大噪的“农民企业家”。然而，这强者似乎又不堪一击，因为他后来的“成就”是仰仗与跛脚的“城市姑娘”的婚姻。为了使自己成为一个“城里人”，他不惜牺牲自己的爱情，但最终，他还是因靠山倒台而被人作为牺牲品送上了被告席，做一个城里人的梦还是被无情地粉碎了。人们发现，老四在发迹、走红的过程中，他的灵魂世界的贫瘠状态并无多大改变，他始终没有形成独立的人格意识，物质上的丰盈至多满足了他的虚荣心，而并未改变他的精神面貌。
    剧作不是对老四这一艺术形象作简单的道德评价。实际上，老四的象征性在于，他表面上具有行动的自觉和主动性，而实质上，巨大的历史惯性无时无刻不在操纵他、玩弄他，骨子里，他是被动和消极的。作为一个乡村青年，一个颠沛流离的盲流，老四的“成为城里人”的梦是顺理成章、无可指责的，问题在于老四身上确实有许多阿Q式的天性：玩女人、摆阔气，一副暴发户的“派头”。他虽然走进了城市，但在整个观念、气质、行为方式上，依然与现代文明相去甚远，他的悲剧不在于他失去了二芹，找错了老婆，而在于他孤注一掷的投机心理和对市民化社会的膜拜与追随。当然，老四个性中的先天不足，是源于社会文化环境的复杂，从这一意义上可以说，老四的悲剧性命运，能够激发人们对改革艰难性的进一步体认。
    作为一部现实主义作品，《野草》在对人物个性、性格和心理的刻画上，在舞台呈现上，都是比较成功的。老四对二芹欲爱不能、欲罢不忍的复杂心态，很有层次性和立体感；二芹对老四的那种刻骨铭心、澄澈透明的爱情和她刚烈、自尊的性格的矛盾与冲突，她在自己好强的个性与对老四的纯真爱情之间苦苦挣扎，也在剧中表现得淋漓尽致。
    故事结尾处，老四走向法庭，而二芹和追随老四的弟兄们有如失去头雁的一群哀鸿，竟离开了他们曾为之洒落那么多眼泪那么多血汗的城市，返回故土。他们最初是野草，最后注定又要还原为野草吗？“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”，一个盲流的城市梦升起又破灭了。然而，也许正是因为这无数生生灭灭，死去而又顽强地复活的“城市梦”，才使我们的社会一步一步地从古典走向现代，从蒙昧走向文明。
