Recently, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the State Taxation Administration have successively issued the "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Individual Industrial and Commercial Households and Private Enterprises" and the "Announcement on Rectifying the Tax Order of Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Households." The state's strengthening of supervision and management of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises is aimed at further improving rectification and order, protecting legal operations, stopping illegal activities, and promoting their healthy development.

The measures taken by the state authorities are necessary and timely. However, some people have doubts, fearing that the policy will change and that the government will no longer allow the existence and development of individual and private economies.

This is a complete misunderstanding. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, especially in recent years, under the guidance of the reform and opening-up policy, urban and rural individual and private economies have developed rapidly. By the end of 1988, the number of individual workers reached over 23 million, and there were more than 40,000 private enterprises. Practice has proven that the development of individual and private economies to a certain extent promotes production, activates the market, expands employment, and meets the various needs of people's lives. It has become a necessary supplement to the public economy in our country.

However, it must be pointed out that while developing individual and private economies, some new problems have indeed emerged, and some problems have not been well solved. Some private enterprise owners lack professional ethics, use improper means to exploit consumers; some monopolize the market, drive up prices, engage in smuggling and illegal activities, and seek illegal profits. The problem of tax evasion is also widespread. Some people, after making a fortune by any means, indulge in extravagance, gambling, and prostitution, seriously disrupting social order.

These problems have long caused strong public dissatisfaction and have had a significant negative impact on the thoughts and emotions of state-owned enterprise workers and the broad masses of the people, becoming a social issue. Therefore, we must pay sufficient attention to these problems.

The policy of reform and opening up will not change, and the policy of allowing the existence and development of individual and private economies will not change either. However, it must be reiterated that we must develop various economic components, including individual and private economies, on the premise that the public economy is the mainstay. The policy of implementing various distribution methods on the premise that distribution according to work is the mainstay, and encouraging some people to get rich first through honest labor and legal operations under the goal of common prosperity will not change.

Now, on the one hand, we must quickly formulate and improve relevant policies and laws to protect the legitimate interests of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises, and prevent illegal operations and illegal income. On the other hand, we must also strengthen their education, guidance, and supervision and management. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments should work with other relevant departments to conduct a comprehensive investigation and inspection of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises. For problems such as participating in turmoil, rioting, illegal operations, and seeking illegal profits discovered during the investigation, they should be dealt with according to the law. Those who need to be criticized and educated should be criticized and educated, those who need to be fined should be fined, those who need to have their property confiscated should have their property confiscated, and those who need to be suspended or have their licenses revoked should be suspended or have their licenses revoked. Those who violate the law should be handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment. We must educate individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprise owners to pay taxes according to the law and resolutely stop tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax resistance. Strengthening the tax collection and administration of individual households and private enterprises is not just about collecting more money and increasing fiscal revenue; it is more about easing social distribution inequities, establishing good social customs, and maintaining social stability and unity. Conducting in-depth patriotic education, legal education, and vocational ethics education for the broad masses of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprise employees, and strengthening supervision and management, is to make them become law-abiding, diligent, and wealthy operators. This is beneficial not only to the country, to society, but also to themselves. We believe that through the efforts of all parties, China's individual and private economies will be able to develop on the right track, and individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprise owners will be able to make greater contributions to the country.

    加强监督管理　促进健康发展
    本报评论员
    最近，国家工商行政管理局、国家税务局相继发布《关于对个体工商户和私营企业加强管理的通知》和《关于整顿城乡个体工商业户税收秩序的通告》。国家对个体工商户和私营企业加强监督管理，是为了进一步搞好治理整顿，保护合法经营，制止违法乱纪，以促进其健康发展。
    国家主管部门采取的这些措施，是必要的，也是适时的。但也有人因此产生一些疑虑，担心政策要变，政府将不再允许个体经济和私营经济的继续存在和发展。
    这完全是一种误解。党的十一届三中全会以来，特别是近几年来，在改革开放方针的指引下，城乡个体经济和私营经济有了较快发展。到1988年底，个体从业人员达2300多万人，私营企业达4万余户。实践证明，个体工商业和私营经济一定程度的发展，有利于促进生产，活跃市场，扩大劳动就业，方便人民群众各方面的生活需要。它已经成为我国公有制经济必要的补充。
    但是，必须指出的是，在发展个体经济和私营经济的同时，也确实出现了一些新的问题，有些问题至今还没有很好解决。私营企业主中的一些人，有的缺乏职业道德，用不正当手段盘剥消费者；有的欺行霸市，哄抬物价，走私贩私，违法乱纪，牟取暴利。偷税漏税的面也是比较宽的。有些人不择手段发了横财之后，挥霍浪费，嫖娼赌博，严重妨害社会治安。
    这些问题，早已引起群众的强烈不满，对国营企业职工，对广大人民群众的思想情绪也产生了很大的消极影响，成为一个社会问题。因此，必须引起我们足够的重视。
    改革开放的方针不会变，允许个体经济和私营经济存在和发展的政策也不会变。但必须重申，要在公有制为主体的前提下发展多种经济成份，包括个体经济和私营经济。在以按劳分配为主体的前提下实行多种分配形式，在共同富裕的目标下鼓励一部分人通过诚实劳动和合法经营先富起来的政策也不会变。
    现在，我们一方面要尽快制订和完善有关政策法律，保护个体工商户和私营企业的合法利益，杜绝非法经营和非法所得，另一方面，也要加强对他们的教育、引导、监督管理。各地工商行政管理机关应会同其他有关部门对个体工商户和私营企业进行一次全面的清理和检查，对清查中发现的参与动乱、暴乱和违法经营、牟取暴利等问题，应根据情节依法处理，该批评教育的批评教育，该罚款的罚款，该没收财物的没收财物，直至停业整顿、吊销执照。触犯刑律的应送交司法机关惩办。我们要教育个体工商业者和私人企业主依法纳税，坚决制止偷税、漏税、抗税的行为。加强对个体户和私营企业的税收征管，不仅是多收几个钱，财政增加点收入的问题，更是关系到缓解社会分配不公，树立良好社会风气，维护社会安定团结的政治问题。对广大个体工商业和私营企业的从业人员深入开展爱国主义教育、法制教育和职业道德教育，加强监督管理，是为了使他们成为守法经营、勤劳致富的经营者。这不仅于国家有利，于社会有利，于他们自己也是有利的。相信经过各方面的努力，我国的个体经济和私营经济能沿着正确的轨道发展下去，个体工商业者和私营企业主也会为国家作出更大贡献。
