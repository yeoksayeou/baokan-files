Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

The State Planning Commission recently sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, commending the staff for their outstanding completion of the emergency coal transportation task, making a significant contribution to the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

To ensure that the growth rate of electricity this year reaches 5.6% to 6%, and to arrange for the transportation of coal for the winter, the State Planning Commission held a meeting on the transportation of coal at Qinhuangdao Port at the end of July. The meeting required that the number of coal cars arriving at Qinhuangdao Port by rail in August and September should average 2,550 cars per day. With the joint efforts of the Beijing Railway Bureau and other relevant units, 4.168 million tons of coal were transported in August, an increase of 752,000 tons compared to the previous month. The highest daily transportation volume reached 3,105 cars. Qinhuangdao Port fully tapped its potential, and in August, 4.71 million tons of coal were shipped, an increase of 1.45 million tons compared to the previous month, setting a new record for monthly shipments.

The Shanghai and Guangzhou Maritime Bureaus, which account for more than 90% of the coal transportation tasks, actively adjusted their transportation capacity, organized foreign trade line ships to participate in the emergency transportation of coal, and strengthened the scheduling of coal ships to reduce the loss of transportation capacity. As a result, they achieved the highest monthly coal transportation volume in history. The China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company, in a situation where the transportation capacity of bulk cargo ships was quite tight, supported the emergency transportation of coal along the coast. Upon receiving the dispatch order, they immediately took action and transported 182,000 tons of coal in half a month, completing the task ahead of schedule.

The State Planning Commission's letter of commendation to the Ministries of Railways and Communications stated that during this emergency coal transportation, many exemplary deeds of selflessness, hard work, overcoming difficulties, and resolutely completing tasks emerged on the frontlines of railways and communications. It is hoped that they will remain humble and press on, focusing on weak links, tapping potential, and making new contributions to further ensuring the completion of the national plan.

    出色完成抢运煤炭任务
    国家计委致函表扬铁道交通两部职工
    本报北京9月4日讯　记者鲁牧报道：国家计委日前致函铁道部、交通部，表扬干部职工出色地完成抢运煤炭任务，为国民经济持续稳定协调发展作出突出贡献。
  为确保今年电力增长速度达到5.6％—6％，安排好过冬煤炭运输，国家计委在7月末召开了秦皇岛港煤炭运输办公会议，要求八九两月铁路到达秦皇岛港的煤车日均2550车。在北京铁路局等有关单位共同努力下，8月份共调入煤炭416.8万吨，比上月多调入75.2万吨，最高日调入量达3105车。秦皇岛港充分挖掘潜力，8月份共装运煤炭471万吨，比上月多装145万吨，创月度装运历史最好成绩。
    占煤炭运输任务90％以上的上海、广州海运局积极调整运力，组织外贸航线船舶投入抢运煤炭，并强化煤船调度，减少运力损失，结果创造了月运煤量历史最高水平。中国远洋总公司在散装货船运力相当紧张情况下，为支援沿海抢运煤炭，接到调度命令立即行动，半个月就运出煤炭18.2万吨，超额完成了任务。
    国家计委给铁道、交通两部的表扬信说，在这次抢运煤炭中，铁道、交通战线涌现出许多公而忘私、艰苦奋斗、克服困难、坚决完成任务的好人好事，希望戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，狠抓薄弱环节，挖掘潜力，为进一步保证国家计划的完成做出新的贡献。
