Early this year, several middle-aged and young officers from our bureau went to the hospital for check-ups and found that some had late-stage liver cirrhosis, others had third-degree pulmonary tuberculosis, and some had renal tuberculosis...

The decline in the physical condition of public security officers is a widespread problem. According to incomplete statistics from our bureau, more than 60% of the officers have various chronic diseases. The reasons are multifaceted.

Due to the demanding and stressful nature of their jobs, insufficient manpower, heavy public security tasks, and excessive workload, they have become ill from overwork. New recruits, after a couple of years, have dark faces, dry skin, and dull hair. Young men in their twenties look like middle-aged people. After a few years, many have become weak and frail, showing signs of premature aging. Due to the intense nature of public security work, officers often cannot receive timely treatment for their illnesses, turning minor ailments into major ones.

Medical and living conditions are relatively poor, and medical supplies are insufficient. Currently, our bureau's medical expenses are managed on a quota basis, with more than 70% of the officers exceeding their medical allowance. Among them, those who exceed the quota by two or three hundred yuan each year number more than ten. Due to heavy economic burdens, some officers can only endure their illnesses without seeking treatment, relying on their physical strength. Some officers, due to long-term residence in damp and dark shacks, have contracted chronic diseases.

We appeal to leaders at all levels and relevant departments to take measures to improve the living conditions and treatment of public security officers.

　　关心公安干警的健康
    今年初，我局几名中青年干警到医院就诊发现，有的身患晚期肝硬化，有的患3度肺结核，有的患肾结核……
    公安干警体质下降已是普遍性问题。据我局不完全统计，约有60％以上的干警身上患有各种慢性疾病，究其原因是多方面的。
    由于职业辛苦紧张，警力不足，繁重的治安任务和超负荷的工作量使他们积劳成疾。新入伍的小伙子，两三年后，脸就变黑，皮肤干燥，头发失去光泽，20多岁的小伙子一副中年人模样。几年下来，病残体弱、未老先衰的大有人在。由于治安工作紧张，使干警有病得不到及时治疗，小病拖成了大病。
    医疗和生活条件较差，医药费短缺。目前我局的医疗费用实行包干，70％以上的同志医药费超标，其中超标二三百元者每年不下10多人。因经济负担较重，一些干警只好有病不看，以体力相拚。有的干警因长期住在阴暗潮湿的危房中，患上了慢性疾病。
    呼吁各级领导和有关部门采取措施，改善公安干警的生活条件和待遇。
