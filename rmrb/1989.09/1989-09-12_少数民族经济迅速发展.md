The Socialist Cause is Advancing

Gansu is a province with a diverse population of ethnic minorities. The province is home to 10 ethnic minority groups, including the Bao'an, Dongxiang, and Yugur, who live in concentrated communities. Various ethnic minorities, who had long been in a state of poverty, backwardness, and oppression, have, since the founding of New China, undergone a series of social reforms and gradually begun to live in a new era of equality, unity, and civilization. In particular, over the past 10 years, the provincial Party committee and government have implemented classified guidance and formulated 66 measures to promote economic and cultural development for each ethnic minority region. They have also increased special construction funds for ethnic minority areas. By the end of 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the two autonomous prefectures and five autonomous counties in the province reached more than 800 million yuan, an increase of 134% compared to 1980. Among these, the total industrial output value increased by 4.4 times. Currently, the per capita net income of farmers and herdsmen in the five autonomous counties is over 500 yuan. Among them, the per capita net income in Sunan, Subei, and Akesai autonomous counties reached 951 yuan, 1,250 yuan, and 1,521 yuan respectively, placing them among the ranks of advanced counties.

　　少数民族经济迅速发展
    甘肃是个多民族的省份。全省共有保安、东乡、裕固等10个聚居少数民族。长期处于贫穷、落后、被奴役状态的各少数民族，在新中国成立后，经过一系列的社会改革，逐步过上了平等、团结、文明的新生活。特别是近10年来，省委、省政府实行分类指导，分别为各少数民族地区制定了66条促进经济文化建设的措施，增加了民族地区专项建设资金。到1988年底，全省两个自治州和5个自治县的工农业总产值达8亿多元，比1980年增长了134％，其中工业总产值增长了4.4倍。现在，5个自治县的农牧民人均纯收入在500元以上，其中肃南、肃北、阿克塞3个自治县的人均纯收入分别达到951元、1250元、1521元，跃入了先进县行列。
