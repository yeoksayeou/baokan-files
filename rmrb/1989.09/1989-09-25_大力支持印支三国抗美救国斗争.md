New China's Forty Years of Diplomatic Chronicle

After the Geneva Conference in 1954 reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the United States immediately used various means, including direct military intervention, to interfere in Indochina affairs, sabotaging the implementation of the agreement and exacerbating tensions in Asia. The Chinese government and people provided various forms of support and assistance to the anti-American national salvation struggles of the peoples of the three Indochina countries.

In the 1960s, the United States gradually escalated its armed intervention in Vietnam. Chinese leaders and the Chinese government repeatedly issued statements and declarations, expressing deep sympathy and firmly supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Furthermore, the Chinese people were willing to make the greatest national sacrifices to provide substantial aid to Vietnam. China resolutely opposed and continuously exposed the U.S. actions in Laos, where pro-American forces were instigated to sabotage the Geneva Agreement and provoke civil war. Led by Foreign Minister Chen Yi, the Chinese delegation participated in the Geneva Conference on the Laos issue, which opened in May 1961 and lasted 14 months. Through sharp and complex struggles, the conference unanimously adopted the "Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos" and the "Protocol to the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos." Thereafter, as the U.S. escalated its war in Vietnam, making Laos a secondary battlefield, China strongly supported the anti-American national salvation struggles of the patriotic forces in Laos.

On March 18, 1970, after the United States orchestrated a coup in Cambodia, the Chinese government firmly stood on the side of the Cambodian patriotic forces led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. On April 30, 1970, after U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, the Chinese government issued a statement fully supporting the Cambodian people's anti-invasion struggle and was the first to recognize the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea. On May 20 of the same year, Chairman Mao Zedong issued a statement, enthusiastically supporting the Cambodian people's anti-American national salvation struggle.

    大力支持印支三国抗美救国斗争
    1954年日内瓦会议达成关于恢复印度支那和平的协议后，美国随即使用各种手段乃至直接出兵插手印支事务，破坏协议执行，加剧了亚洲紧张局势。对印支三国人民的抗美救国斗争，中国政府和人民给予了各种形式的支持与援助。
    60年代以后，美国对越南的武装干涉逐步升级。中国领导人和中国政府一再发表讲话和声明，深切同情和坚决支持越南人民的爱国正义斗争。此外，中国人民不惜承担最大的民族牺牲，向越南提供了巨大援助。中国坚决反对并不断揭露美国在老挝策动亲美势力破坏日内瓦协议、挑动内战的行径。以陈毅外长为首的中国代表团参加了1961年5月开幕长达14个月的关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议，经过尖锐复杂的斗争，促成会议一致通过《关于老挝中立的宣言》和《关于老挝中立宣言的议定书》。此后，当美国侵越战争不断升级使老挝成为副战场后，中国大力支持老挝爱国力量的抗美救国斗争。
    1970年3月18日，美国在柬埔寨策动政变后，中国政府坚定地站在以西哈努克亲王为代表的柬埔寨爱国力量一边。1970年4月30日美军和南越部队入侵柬埔寨后，中国政府发表声明全力声援柬埔寨人民反侵略斗争，并且第一个承认了柬埔寨王国民族团结政府。同年5月20日，毛泽东主席发表声明，热烈支持柬埔寨人民的抗美救国斗争。
