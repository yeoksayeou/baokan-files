A Servant's Heart
— A Record of the Secretary of the Party Branch of Doudian Village, Fangshan District, Beijing, Zhang Zhenliang
By Zhang Shuzheng, Reporter of this Newspaper

Old Zhang has grown thinner and older, still wearing the same dark blue Zhongshan suit I saw on him four years ago during my interview. He is over sixty, and it's hard for him to take a day off in a year, unless he is made of iron.

However, Doudian Village has been rejuvenated. Two shiny, wide asphalt roads have been built in the village center, connecting the Jing-Shi (Shijiazhuang) and Jing-Zhou (Zhoukoudian) highways at both ends. The old houses along the roads and the old courtyards next to the stinking ditches are almost gone, replaced by several new, beautiful two-story buildings. These 18 buildings were mainly funded by the villagers themselves, with the village contributing 10%. A total of 26 households live in them, including two households of party members and cadres who are relocating back to their original homes, and the rest are non-party member villagers. Zhang Zhenliang's family still lives in the old-style rural house without a kitchen or bathroom, with a narrow courtyard.

Smoke rises from the village houses. In the summer of 1986, Huang Hua, Vice Chairman of the Sixth National People's Congress Standing Committee, sat down in front of the simple stove in Doudian Village's Economic Cooperation Society. He had toured the farm, agricultural machinery station, and other places, and it was already past noon.

The meal was ready. Huang Hua said, "Zhang Zhenliang, today I'll treat you. Let's eat together!"

Old Zhang's heart skipped a beat. Since 1956, when he became the village party branch secretary, he had never "accompanied" anyone for a meal, regardless of who it was. He frowned and replied, "Comrade Huang Hua, I never accompany guests for meals. Let's follow the old rules."

Huang Hua had heard about Old Zhang's habit of not accompanying guests for meals and was genuinely impressed by this grassroots cadre's excellent work style. He quickly replied, "Good, good, I'll follow your old rules!"

In recent years, whether it was for inspections or business discussions, from high-ranking party and state leaders, provincial and municipal leaders, to enterprise and public institution employees, the invitations to "accompany meals" were countless. Old Zhang always politely declined.

Doudian Village has four ethnic groups: Han, Hui, Manchu, and Zhuang, with 1131 households. Since Old Zhang became a cadre, he has never eaten from anyone's bowl.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, during the critical period of year-end distribution in rural areas, a young man in a suit and leather shoes came to see Old Zhang: "Secretary Zhang, I heard that you have a lot of bricks piled up?" Old Zhang said, "Yes, at least 10 million bricks." The visitor took out a calculator and pressed a few buttons, then said, "How about this? I know a few secretaries and section chiefs who are big shots on Beijing's construction sites. You give them a one-cent commission per brick, treat them to a meal at Hongbinlou, sign the contract on the spot, and guarantee that the bricks will be cleared and the money will be in your hands within half a month." Old Zhang smiled and replied, "I am a secretary of the Communist Party branch. Those secretaries and section chiefs you mentioned are also party members! Tell you, I would rather let the bricks block the kiln door than do something that corrupts the Communist Party!"

Zhang Zhenliang despises those who use the banner of "reform" to stuff money into their own pockets. He does not touch the easily obtainable "commissions"; he also refuses to accept money for the village that comes from improper sources. He often says, "Things that should be done, I will do without eating or taking 'big unity' (a slang term for bribes). Things that should not be done, no matter how much you pull and tug, I will not do."

Doudian Village has two big ledgers. One is the "10 Years of Reform Contributions Ledger," recording the considerable amounts of grain, cattle, pigs, eggs, milk, vegetables, and industrial products sold to the state from 1978 to 1988. The other is the "Village Cadres' Personal Income Ledger for Nearly 10 Years." Their incomes are publicly evaluated every year in the village and are at the "upper-middle" level among all workers. Old Zhang has always taken this "upper-middle" income.

Currently, many places implement the household contract responsibility system, but Doudian does not divide the land. The land is managed by the village collectively, and a specialized contract responsibility system is implemented. Old Zhang dared to take this step, which was risky.

As early as the 1960s and 1970s, Old Zhang spent 20 years leading the entire village to fill in more than 60 gullies, leveling 5200 mu of arable land, digging more than 50 wells 40 meters deep, building several kilometers of above-ground and underground irrigation facilities, and purchasing dozens of agricultural machinery. This "one well per hundred mu, machinery matching" water-saving and mechanized landscape was hard-won by Old Zhang and the entire village with their blood and sweat! They did not agree to divide the land, not because they opposed the "big package responsibility system," but because they felt that reforms should start from reality and choose a responsibility system form suitable for the local area.

However, this led to a lot of gossip. Some said that Zhang Zhenliang was opposing the central government. Others said that Doudian would not divide the land, first deal with Old Zhang, and then divide the land.

Old Zhang endured immense pressure for more than a year until March 1983, when the first secretary of the municipal party committee, Shanjun Yi, visited Doudian and told Zhang Zhenliang, "Just do it this way!" The "Doudian Incident" was resolved, and Zhang Zhenliang's "risk" was lifted.

In fact, Old Zhang's move protected the village's hard-won water-saving and mechanized achievements from many years of struggle, buying time for the village to adjust its industrial structure and accelerate the reform process. So far, the village has equipped itself with more than 200 sets of agricultural machinery with a total of more than 3000 horsepower. The number of laborers engaged in grain production has been reduced from the original 1200 to 120. Mechanization permeates the entire agricultural production process. The village continuously improves the management system that matches the productive forces, has adjusted the industrial structure several times, and has successively established a "100,000-chicken farm," an "export beef cattle base," and grain, meat, garment processing plants, as well as pharmaceutical, brick, and tile factories and 28 other village-run enterprises. Last year, the village's total economic income was 31 million yuan, and the total value of collective fixed assets was 35 million yuan, increasing by 30.8 times and 44 times compared to 1977, respectively. All this would be difficult to achieve without "unified management."

Doudian Village has broken away from the traditional agricultural dead end of "digging in the soil" and achieved a "two-way virtuous cycle" of complementary planting and breeding, and agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce. It has created the "Doudian Model" of rural reform. In June last year, Comrade Peng Zhen visited the village and said, "Doudian's reform is very good, and I support this model." The State Science and Technology Commission awarded Doudian Village and Zhang Zhenliang the "National Star Science and Technology Award."

Doudian Village has become an important window for international friends to understand China's rural reforms. Leaders and agricultural experts from more than 30 countries and regions around the world have expressed their admiration after visiting the village. Last summer, UNESCO sent a team to Doudian Village to film, providing a 15-minute television program "The Transformation of Doudian" for more than 150 countries and regions.

The story of Zhang Zhenliang, an ordinary Chinese peasant, is being spread in China and around the world by people speaking various dialects and translated into various languages.

Old Zhang said, "Since the day I joined the party and took the oath, I have always remembered the party's motto of serving the people wholeheartedly." Zhang Zhenliang, the son of a Hui peasant, suffered the whip in the old society. He joined the party in 1955 (at the age of 27) and became the village party branch secretary at the age of 28. He vowed to turn the village's poor, dilapidated, and impoverished appearance upside down; at the same time, he established the "four no-rules": no accepting invitations to accompany guests, no receiving gifts or bribes, no yielding to evil winds, and no taking an extra penny of remuneration. For more than 30 years, he has remained steadfast in this resolve.

Under Old Zhang's leadership, the Doudian Village Party Organization has been awarded the titles of "Model Party Branch" and "Advanced Party Branch" by the city, district, and township multiple times in recent years.

    公仆心
    ——记北京市房山区窦店村党总支书记仉振亮
    本报记者　张书政
    老仉瘦了，也老了，身上穿的还是4年前我采访他时看见的那套藏青色中山装。他年逾花甲，一年又难得歇上一天，除非铁打的人谁不见老。
    然而，窦店村却返老还童了。村中央建起两条乌亮亮、宽展展的柏油马路，四端连着京石（石家庄）、京周（周口店）公路。路两旁的老土屋挨着臭水坑的旧宅院几乎不见了，盖起不少崭新、美观的二层小楼。这18幢楼，主要靠自筹资金盖的，村里补助10％。共住26户，有两户是党员干部，他们是户归原址的搬迁户，其余都是非党员群众家。仉振亮家仍住在没厨房、没卫生间的老式农村旧房里，院子狭小。
    村舍里炊烟袅袅。六届全国人大常委会副委员长黄华在窦店村经联社的简易灶房前坐下来。这是1986年夏，黄华到窦店考察，转了农场、农机站等处，天已过午。
    饭、菜备好了。黄华说：“仉振亮，今天我请客，咱们一块吃！”
    老仉心里“嘎蹬”一下。他从1956年担任村党支书到现在，凡是因公来村而招待用餐的人，无论是谁，他从不“陪吃”。他皱了皱眉头，答道：“黄华同志，我从来不陪客吃饭，还是照老规矩办吧！”
    黄华对老仉不陪吃已有耳闻，现在听本人亲口一说，由衷地赞佩这位基层干部的优良作风，连忙表示：“好，好，我遵守您的老规矩！”
    近几年，来窦店考察或谈生意的，上至党和国家领导人，省、市领导，下至企、事业单位职工，“陪客用餐”的邀请不知有多少回，老仉总是婉言谢绝。
    窦店村有汉、回、满、壮4个民族，1131户人家。老仉当干部以来，从未端过哪家的饭碗。
    春节前夕，正是农村年终分配的节骨眼上。一个西装革履的青年找到老仉：“仉书记，听说您这儿的砖积压了？”老仉说：“是，少说也压着1千万块”。来者摸出计算器按了几下，又说：“这么着吧，我认识几个书记、科长，都是北京建筑工地上的‘大拿’。一块砖您给他们一厘好处费，再上鸿宾楼撮一顿，当场签合同，包您半月砖净、钱到手。”老仉笑了，答道：“我是共产党的支部书记，您要请的那几位书记、科长，也不会是别的党的！告诉您，我宁可让砖把窑门堵死，也不能办共产党腐蚀共产党的事！”
    仉振亮憎恶打着“改革”旗号往自己兜里搂钱的人。他对唾手可得的“好处费”一点不沾；对能给村里增加收入、但来路不正的钱，也拒之门外。他常说：“该办的事，不用吃请，不用拿‘大团结’，我一定给办。不该办的事，你再拉拉扯扯，我也不办。”
    窦店村有两本大帐。一本是10年改革贡献帐，记载着1978至1988年该村向国家交售粮、牛、猪、蛋、奶、菜及工业品等一笔笔可观的数字。另一本是村干部近10年个人收入帐。他们的收入在村里每年都是公开评定，在各业劳动者中居“中等偏上”水平。老仉也一直拿这个“中等偏上”。
    眼下，许多地方实行家庭联产承包责任制，而窦店却没分地，地由村里统一经营，搞专业承包责任制。老仉敢走这步棋，是冒着风险的。
    早在60至70年代，老仉用了20年时间，带领全村人锹挖镐刨地填平60多条沟谷，平整了全村5200亩耕地，打出50多眼40米深的电机井，修建几千米和几十座地上、地下灌溉设施，又购进几十部农机具。这种“百亩一井、农机配套”的水利化、机械化局面，是老仉和全村人用血汗换来的呀！他们不同意分地，不是反对“大包干”，只是觉得搞改革应从实际出发，选择适合本地区的责任制形式。
    但是，这样一来，风言风语不少。有人说，仉振亮是和中央对着干。也有的说，窦店再捂着不分，先处理老仉头，后分地。
    老仉顶着巨大压力干了一年多，直到1983年3月，市委第一书记段君毅到窦店考察后对仉振亮说：“你就这么干吧！”“窦店风波”平息了，仉振亮的“风险”也解除了。
    其实，老仉这步棋，保护了该村多年奋斗得来的水利化、机械化成果，为该村适时调整产业结构、加速改革进程赢得了时间。到目前，该村已装备起具有3000多马力的200多台（套）农机具。全村搞粮食的劳力由原来的1200个减少到120个。机械化贯穿农业生产全过程。该村不断完善与生产力相适应的管理体制，已几次调整产业结构，陆续建起“10万只养鸡场”、“出口肉牛基地”和粮食、肉类、服装加工厂以及制药、制砖瓦等28个村办企业。去年全村经济总收入3100万元，集体固定资产总值3500万元，分别比1977年增长30.8倍和44倍。这一切，离开“统一经营”是很难实现的。
    窦店村走出了“土里刨食”的传统农业的死胡同，实现种植业与养殖业互补互促和农、牧业与工、商业互补互促的“两个良性循环”，创出农村改革的“窦店模式”。去年6月，彭真同志到该村视察时说：“窦店改革非常好，这种模式我赞成。”国家科委授予窦店村和仉振亮个人“国家星火科技奖”。
    窦店村已成为国际友人了解我国农村改革的重要窗口。世界上30多个国家和地区的领导人及农业专家到该村考察后表示称赞。去年夏，联合国教科文组织派人到窦店村录像，为150多个国家和地区提供了15分钟的《窦店的变革》的电视节目。
    仉振亮这个普通中国农民的事迹，被操着各种口音、译成各种语言的人，在中国和世界各地传播着。
    老仉说：“我从入党宣誓那天起到现在，头脑里一直记着党的全心全意为人民服务的宗旨。”仉振亮，这个回族农民的儿子，在旧社会饱尝皮鞭之苦。他1955年（27岁）入党，28岁担任村党支书后，立志把村里破、烂、穷的面貌翻个个儿；同时，立下“四不守则”：不吃请陪客、不收礼受贿、不向歪风邪气让步、不多要一分报酬。30多年来，他按此矢志不移。
    在老仉的带领下，窦店村党组织近年来多次荣获市、区、乡授予的“模范党支部”、“先进党支部”称号。
