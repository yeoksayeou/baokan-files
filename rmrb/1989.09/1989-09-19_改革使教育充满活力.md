Reform Brings Vitality to Education

In 1949, when Beijing was peacefully liberated, this ancient city had only 950 primary schools and 81 middle schools, with a total of 360,000 students. Forty years later, 2,191 new primary schools and 759 middle schools had been built, with the number of students reaching over 1.3 million. The conditions for education have also significantly improved. Many middle schools in urban areas have added modern facilities such as computer labs; many dilapidated and rundown primary and middle schools in rural areas have been rebuilt. The Party and the government are paying increasing attention to the education sector, and the people are increasingly supporting it. The dropout rate for primary and middle school students in Beijing is the lowest in the country. Beijing was also the first major city to solve the problem of the "two-session system" in primary schools, and in recent years, even during peak enrollment periods, there has been no recurrence of the "two-session system."

Since 1980, Beijing has established vocational high schools, with a total of 185 vocational high schools and 232 specialties or trades. The ratio of ordinary high school students to vocational high school students in urban areas has reached 1:0.59. Due to changes in the educational structure, a significant number of students have acquired a skill by the time they graduate from high school, enabling them to enter the workforce.

The city's educational funds have been increasing year by year. In 1986, educational funds accounted for 16.7% of the city's fiscal expenditure, 17% in 1987, and 18.1% in 1988. This year, the plan is to reach 20%. Since 1985, the municipal government has also implemented ten educational initiatives each year. To promote the societal value of "respecting teachers and valuing education," the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government, along with various departments, commissions, offices, and districts/counties, have each taken responsibility for one or two schools. To alleviate the housing difficulties faced by primary and middle school teachers, the municipal government has allocated special funds to build 500,000 square meters of housing for teachers in suburban areas, and has arranged for 250,000 square meters of housing construction for teachers in distant suburban areas/counties, with a subsidy of 15 million yuan. To improve teachers' welfare, those who have worked in education for 30 years will receive a reward upon retirement, and 5,000 high and middle-level professional titles have been added for the reform of teachers' professional titles.

In recent years, Beijing has begun a trial of deepening reforms: starting with reforms in personnel, labor, and distribution systems, introducing a competitive mechanism within schools, fundamentally solving the long-standing issues in the internal management system of primary and middle schools, fully mobilizing teachers' enthusiasm, making schools autonomous educational entities, and enhancing the vitality of education. The main contents of this reform are: implementing the principal responsibility system, hiring teachers on a contractual basis, implementing a fixed total wage system for teachers based on the approved number of teaching staff, and implementing an internal wage structure system. So far, 984 schools in the city have either undergone or completed the first phase of the reform, accounting for 48% of the 2,042 schools in the city that are supposed to implement the reform. After the start of the 1989 academic year, this pioneering reform will be fully implemented across the city.

　　改革使教育充满活力
    一九四九年，北平和平解放时，这座古城只有九百五十多所小学，八十一所中学，在校生总共只有三十六万名。四十年以后，新建二千一百九十一所小学、七百五十九所中学，在校生达到一百三十多万名。办学条件也有显著改善，城区有不少中学增设了计算机室等现代化设施；农村许多简陋破旧的中小学校舍已翻盖一新。党和政府对教育事业越来越重视，人民对教育事业越来越支持。北京市中小学生的流失率在全国是最低的。北京也是最早解决小学“二部制”的大城市，近几年入学高峰也没出现“二部制”。
    从一九八○年开始，北京兴办职业高中，至今已有各类职业高中一百八十五所、二百三十二个专业或工种，城区普通高中与职业高中学生的比例已达到一比零点五九。由于教育结构的改变，使相当一批学生在高中毕业时掌握了一技之长，走上工作岗位。
    全市教育经费逐年在增长。一九八六年教育经费占市财政支出的百分之十六点七，一九八七年为百分之十七，一九八八年为百分之十八点一，今年计划达到百分之二十。从一九八五年以来，市政府还连续四年每年为教育办十件实事。为倡导全社会“尊师重教”，市委、市政府及各部、委、办、局及区、县领导每人联系一、二所学校。为缓解中小学教师“住房难”的问题，市政府拨出专款，为城近郊区教工建设了面积五十万平方米住宅，为远郊区（县）先后安排二十五万平方米教师住宅建设指标，并补助专款一千五百万元。为了改善教师待遇，对从事教育工作满三十年的中小学教师在退休时给予奖励，并为中小学教师职称改革增拨五千个高、中级职称指标。
    近年来，北京市又开始了一个深化改革的尝试：从人事、劳动和分配制度的改革入手，把竞争机制引入学校内部，从根本上解决中小学内部管理体制多年存在的弊端，充分调动教师的积极性，使学校成为有一定自主权的办学实体，增强办学的活力。这项改革的主要内容是：实行校长负责制，教职工聘任制，在核定教职工编制的基础上实行工资总额包干，实行校内结构工资制。到目前为止，全市正在改革和已完成第一步改革的学校已有九百八十四所，占全市应实行改革的二千零四十二所学校的百分之四十八。一九八九学年度开学后，这项带有首创性的改革将在全市全面推开。　（徐　泓）
