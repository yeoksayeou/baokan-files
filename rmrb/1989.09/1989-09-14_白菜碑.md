	The White Radish Monument
	When I pick up my chopsticks to eat white radish, I am reminded of the half-century-old memories from my time studying at the National Thirteenth Middle School, Chanshan Branch, by the banks of the Xinjiang River at the foot of the Efang Mountains in Jiangxi. We lived and studied in ancestral halls and temples. The River God Temple by the Xinjiang River was our home. The roaring Xinjiang River accompanied our songs, creating a unique charm.

	The ancient Efang Mountains and the wild Xinjiang River are filled with countless touching legends and anecdotes. In the courtyard of the River God Temple, there were four ancient peach trees. Every spring, they would bloom with red and green leaves, a delightful sight. In the center of the courtyard stood a two-meter-tall stone monument. Carved on it was a large white radish, intricately and vividly sculpted. On either side of the radish were bold, ancient script characters: one side read, "For the people's parents, one must know this taste"; the other side read, "Erected in the Jiachen Year of the Qing Dynasty's Jiaqing Reign."

	It is said that in the past, whenever the spring ended and the summer rains began, the Efang Mountains would unleash torrents of water, causing the Xinjiang River to overflow. Year after year, the floods brought misery, hunger, and death, making life unbearable. Then came a respected county magistrate who, leading the common people, dredged the river channels and diverted water to irrigate the fields, much like Yu the Great did. After years of hard work, the landscape was transformed, the river water clear, and the rice fields lush and bountiful, with harvests year after year. The people praised him, and together they built this River God Temple and erected this unique White Radish Monument. As I pick up my chopsticks, I can't help but think of the comrades who are working tirelessly on the vegetable garden and vegetable basket projects, as well as that towering White Radish Monument.

　　白菜碑
    当我拿起筷子吃白菜时，就想起半个世纪以前在赣东的峨峰山下信江河畔的国立十三中铅山分校念书的往事。我们在祠堂、庙宇住宿、上课。信江河畔的河神庙就是我们的家。咆哮的信江伴随着我们的歌声，真是别有一番情趣。
    古老的峨峰，野马似的信江，流传着多少动人的传说和轶事。在河神庙的天井里，有四株古桃，每逢新春吐红泛绿，甚是喜人。天井正中，竖立一座丈二的大石碑。碑上镌刻了一棵大白菜，精雕细琢，栩栩如生。菜两旁苍劲的隶书：一边是“为民父母，不可不知此味”；一边是清嘉庆丁卯年立。
    据传：当年，每逢春末夏临霪雨季节，峨峰山洪倒海涌涛似地倾泻而下，信江河水横溢。连年泛滥，哀鸿饿殍，民不聊生。来了这位可敬的县官，率领着黎民百姓，仿禹疏九水地疏浚河道，引水溉田。几经苦战，旧貌变新颜，河水清清，稻禾葱葱，丰收连年。万民称颂，集资修建了这座河神庙，竖了这座奇特的白菜丰碑。我拿起筷子，不由得想起正在为菜园子和菜篮子工程操心奔走的同志，以及那棵挺秀的白菜碑。
