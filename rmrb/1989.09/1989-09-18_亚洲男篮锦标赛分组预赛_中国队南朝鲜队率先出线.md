The Asian Men's Basketball Championship Preliminary Rounds

China and South Korea Men's Basketball Teams Advance

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 16th - (Reporter Qu Beilin) The Chinese men's basketball team today defeated Thailand with a score of 96:51, securing two consecutive victories and becoming the first team to advance to the top 8 in the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship.

Following closely behind China is the South Korean team. They defeated Malaysia with a score of 95:72 today. Yesterday, the South Korean team also won their first match against Iran with a score of 102:72. Their final opponent is the Pakistani team.

Yesterday, the Chinese team defeated Saudi Arabia with a score of 120:96. Currently, the only remaining opponent in Group A is Singapore, which has not yet played. Regardless of the outcome of the final match, China has already secured a spot in the top two of their group, earning the right to advance to the top 8.

Chinese head coach Sun Bang told reporters that he was satisfied with the team's defense in the first two matches. However, he believed that the team's performance in the paint during offense was lacking. The main issue was that the players did not handle the ball reasonably. He believed that the main competitors for China in this championship are the South Korean team. The players on that team are familiar opponents from the past few years, with mature techniques, while China's current form is not ideal. The main reason is that due to various factors, there was no winter training this year, resulting in poor physical condition of the players.

　　亚洲男篮锦标赛分组预赛
　　中国队南朝鲜队率先出线
    新华社北京9月16日电　（记者曲北林）中国篮球队今天以96∶51战胜泰国队，以两战两胜的成绩，第一个打进第15届亚洲男子篮球锦标赛前8名。
    紧随中国队之后荣升前8名的是南朝鲜队。该队今天以95∶72战胜马来西亚队。在昨天的比赛中，南朝鲜队曾以102∶72首胜伊朗队。它的最后一个对手是巴基斯坦队。
    中国队昨天曾以120∶96击败沙特阿拉伯队，现在只剩下A组的最后一个对手新加坡队尚未交锋。不论最后这场比赛胜负，中国队都已稳获小组前两名，取得了晋升前8名的资格。
    中国队主教练孙邦对记者说，他对中国队前两场比赛的防守是满意的。但是认为中国队在进攻时的内线表现欠佳。主要是队员们对球的处理不够合理。他认为这次锦标赛中国队的主要竞争对手是南朝鲜队。该队队员都是几年来中国队所熟悉的老对手，技术已比较成熟，而中国目前状态则不佳。主要原因是今年由于种种原因没有冬训，队员的身体素质不理想。
