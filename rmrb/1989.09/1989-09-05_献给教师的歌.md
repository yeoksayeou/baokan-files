		A Song for Teachers
		Is it the frost of the years
		Or the dust of chalk that has whitened your long, silvered temples? Is it the rings of time,
		Or the scars of wind and snow that have etched your brow… I, now a grandfather, can no longer read without glasses; suddenly awakened, I realize I have traversed more than half my life. Standing before you, facing this venerable elder, I feel as if I have put on my red scarf again, dreaming the dreams of youth. You are still so kind,
		Still so dignified, your familiar opening words—
		Always for the children, your sincere blessings—
		Forever for a golden future. The purest of hearts is maternal love, your joyful angels are your students; the most noble of characters is loyalty, your devotion to your calling is an unyielding love. Whenever I think of you, I recall the tumultuous journey of life; whenever I see you, I am stirred by an uncontrollable surge. Holding your burning hands, I can never fully express my reverence; gazing at your sparkling tears, I can never fully convey my deep affection.

    献给教师的歌
    李奇生是岁月的风霜
        还是粉笔的飞尘，染白了您修长的双鬓；是时间的年轮，
      还是风雪的刀痕，镌刻了您天庭的辙印……我，已经当上外公，看书离不开花镜；猛然醒来，才发现走完了大半人生。站在您的眼前，面对德高望重的长者，我仿佛又戴上了红领巾，作起了儿时梦。您还是那样慈祥，
      还是那样庄重，您习惯的开头语——
    总是孩子们，您虔诚的祝福词——
    永远是金色前程。最圣洁的情怀是母爱，您心中快乐的天使是学生；最高尚的品格是忠诚，您献给事业的是不渝的爱情。每当我想想您的时候，便忆起人生坎坷的旅程；每当我见到您的时候，便激起无法克制的冲动。紧握您滚烫的双手，怎么也表达不出对您的崇敬；仰望您闪烁的泪花，怎么也倾诉不出对您的深情。
