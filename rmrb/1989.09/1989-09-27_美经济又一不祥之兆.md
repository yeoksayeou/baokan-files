In the second quarter of this year, the United States experienced an approximately $1.8 billion deficit in its service trade, whereas it had a $15 billion surplus in the first quarter. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred in the past 30 years. This sudden change has left many in the U.S. economic community bewildered.

Service trade, also known as "invisible trade," includes items such as interest, dividends, profits, rents, insurance fees, transportation fees, and international tourism expenses. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the deficit from investment income (interest, dividends, profits) in the second quarter was $50.2 billion, while the surplus from other items was $48.4 billion, resulting in an approximate $1.8 billion deficit. This indicates that the U.S. service trade deficit is closely related to the U.S. becoming the world's largest debtor nation.

In 1985, the United States became the world's largest debtor nation. By 1988, its total foreign debt had reached over $500 billion. The issue of foreign debt has been a subject of ongoing debate within the United States. The previous Reagan administration believed that U.S. foreign debt was insignificant, arguing that it indicated a favorable investment environment and that foreign investors had confidence in the U.S. economy. However, many economists have warned that if the foreign debt continues to grow unchecked, it will have serious consequences. In their view, the annual increase in foreign debt means that U.S. companies need to use part of their profits to pay interest and dividends to foreign investors.

Historically, service trade has been a significant advantage for the United States. Over the past decade, the U.S. current account deficit has often been lower than its goods trade deficit because the surplus in service trade offset part of the goods trade deficit. However, in the first half of this year, an abnormal situation has emerged, which is due to the shrinking or reversal of the service trade surplus.

It is difficult to predict how U.S. service trade will develop in the future. However, the fact that a deficit appeared for the first time in the second quarter of this year is an ominous sign and another indication of the relative decline of the U.S. economy. If, as some economists estimate, U.S. foreign debt continues to rise sharply, the outlook for U.S. service trade is not optimistic.

    美经济又一不祥之兆
    本报记者　张　亮
    今年第二季度，美国的劳务贸易出现了大约一点八亿美元逆差，而第一季度还有十五亿美元顺差。这是三十年来未曾有过的现象。这种急转直下的变化使美国经济界人士感到困惑。
    劳务贸易亦称“无形贸易”，包括利息、股息、利润、租金、保险费、运输费、国际旅游费等“服务”项目。根据美国商务部的统计，第二季度投资所得（利息、股息、利润）逆差为五十点二亿美元，其它项目的顺差为四十八点四亿美元，因而出现了大约一点八亿美元逆差。这表明美国劳务贸易出现逆差与美国成为世界最大债务国密切相关。
    一九八五年，美国成为世界最大债务国。到一九八八年，其外债总额已达五千多亿美元。美国国内对此问题一直争论不休。前里根政府认为，美国外债无关紧要，它倒说明美国投资环境好，外国投资者对美国经济充满信心。但是，许多经济学家则警告说，如果外债长此发展下去，后患无穷。在他们看来，外债连年增加意味着美国公司需要不断将部分利润用来向外国投资者支付利息和股息。
    本来，劳务贸易是美国的一大优势。在过去十几年中，美国的经常项目逆差往往低于商品贸易逆差，因为劳务贸易顺差弥补了部分商品贸易逆差。但是，今年上半年则出现了反常现象，原因就在于劳务贸易顺差缩小或变为赤字。
    美国的劳务贸易今后将如何发展，现在尚难预料。但是，今年第二季度首次出现逆差显然是一个不祥之兆，同时也是表明美国经济相对衰落的又一例证。如果美国的外债像一些经济学家估计的那样扶摇直上，其劳务贸易前景就不容乐观。
