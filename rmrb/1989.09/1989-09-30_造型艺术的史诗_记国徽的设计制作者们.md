As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches, gazing upon the resplendent national emblem hanging high above Tiananmen Gate, one cannot help but recall the countless unsung heroes who dedicated their blood, sweat, and wisdom to the birth of the emblem of New China...

In July 1949, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference published a notice in seven newspapers, including the People's Daily, calling for submissions of designs for the national flag, emblem, and national anthem. On September 30, 1949, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference decided that the national flag of the People's Republic of China would be the Five-Star Red Flag, that the national anthem would be "March of the Volunteers," and that the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University would be invited to organize a design competition for the national emblem.

The Central Academy of Fine Arts included Zhang Dang, Zhang Guangyu, Zhang Zhengyu, Zhou Lingzhao, and Zhong Ling, who was in charge of art at the State Council; Tsinghua University's Department of Architecture included Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, Li Zongjin, Mo Zongjiang, Zhu Changzhong, Wang Guoyu, Hu Yunjing, Zhang Changling, and Luo Zhewen. During the design process, Zhou Lingzhao proposed an emblem featuring the national flag and Tiananmen Gate, while Zhang Dang proposed an emblem with Tiananmen Gate at the center and gears surrounding it. These ideas were adopted by the emblem review committee of the CPPCC as the main elements of the emblem.

On June 20, 1950, Liang Sicheng and eight others designed an emblem in gold and red, featuring the national flag, Tiananmen Gate, gears, wheat ears, and a red ribbon, in accordance with the CPPCC's requirements. After collective discussions by the emblem review committee and a meeting chaired by Premier Zhou Enlai, the design was unanimously approved. Premier Zhou also suggested modifications for the emblem to be "upright," "resonant," and "stately." On June 21, members of the emblem review committee, Ma Xulun and Shen Yanbing, presented the review report to the full session of the CPPCC; on June 23, the full session of the CPPCC unanimously adopted the emblem design. On June 28, the Eighth Session of the Central People's Government Commission approved the CPPCC's proposal regarding the emblem design.

In July 1950, Liang Sicheng, the head of the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, handed over the "Emblem Design" to Gao Zhuang for model making.

Gao Zhuang modified the design based on the requirements for the emblem and Premier Zhou's suggestions for modifications, adhering to the principles of sculptural art. His concept was to "concisely express the essence of our country's foundation and the characteristics of its social structure." He drew inspiration from ancient Chinese bronze mirrors and Northern Wei stone-carved Buddha statues, using a 45-degree sharp-angle, flat, and slightly raised relief technique. This approach showcased the deep, profound, and grand national style of Chinese sculpture, making the subject matter a living whole.

Gao Zhuang, originally named Shen Shizhuang, was from Baoshan, Shanghai. He enrolled in the Department of Fine Arts at Shanghai Art University and studied art education at Shanghai Zhonghua Art University from 1926 to 1928 under the guidance of Principal Chen Wangdao and professors Chen Zhi and Chen Baoyi. He actively participated in the anti-imperialist patriotic propaganda activities of the May 30th Movement. He created and exhibited woodcuts and plaster reliefs of "Lu Xun," "General Zhu," "Lenin," "Gorky," and "Mao Zedong." In May 1947, he was persecuted by reactionaries for participating in the "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War" demonstration and fled to the liberated areas with his eight-year-old son. He served as the head of the Department of Fine Arts at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and changed his name to Gao Zhuang. In 1949, when Beijing was liberated, Gao Zhuang and his son entered the city with the army. He then accepted Liang Sicheng's invitation to teach woodworking at Tsinghua University's Department of Architecture.

While sculpting the emblem, he often stayed up all night, only resting when his fingers were so tired they felt like they would fall off and he was too exhausted to move. His hands possessed extraordinary expressive power, a secret that lay in his heart, which surged with boundless love for his motherland. At 45, Gao Zhuang looked as vigorous as a young man in his twenties. On August 18, 1950, the emblem model designed by Gao Zhuang was unanimously approved. On September 20, 1950, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government officially announced the national emblem of the People's Republic of China and its explanation. The People's Daily published an editorial titled "Respect and Protect the National Emblem." Thus, the national emblem of New China was finally born.

Today, although Liang Sicheng, Gao Zhuang, and others have passed away, the emblem they helped create will forever remain in the hearts of millions of people.

    造型艺术的史诗
    ——记国徽的设计制作者们
    李　思
    时值国庆四十周年，望着天安门城楼上高悬的闪光耀眼的国徽，不禁回想起那些为新中国国徽的诞生而献出热血、智慧的默默无闻的人们……
    一九四九年七月，全国政治协商会议筹备会在《人民日报》等七家报纸刊登了向全国征求国旗、国徽及国歌词谱的启事。一九四九年九月三十日，中国人民政治协商会议决定中华人民共和国的国旗为五星红旗，采用《义勇军进行曲》为国歌，并且决定邀请中央美术学院和清华大学营建系组织力量对国徽方案进行设计竞赛。
    中央美术学院有张仃、张光宇、张正宇、周令钊及在政务院担任美术工作的钟灵参预；清华大学营建系有梁思成、林徽音、李宗津、莫宗江、朱畅中、汪国瑜、胡允敬、张昌龄、罗哲文参预。在设计过程中，有周令钊提出的国旗、天安门为内容的图案，张仃提出的天安门为中心、周围是齿轮的图案。这些都被政协国徽审查小组吸收为国徽图案的主要内容。
    一九五○年六月二十日，梁思成等九人按政协规定的内容，设计出金红两色，以国旗、天安门、齿轮、麦稻穗、红绶带为内容的国徽图案。经过国徽审查组集体讨论，在周恩来总理主持的会议上一致通过。周总理并提出：“向上”、“响亮”、“挺拔”的修改建议。六月二十一日，国徽审查组的马叙伦、沈雁冰向全国政协全体会议提出了审查报告；六月二十三日，政协全体大会一致通过了国徽方案。六月二十八日，中央人民政府委员会第八次会议通过了政协关于国徽图案的建议。
    一九五○年七月，清华大学营建系系主任梁思成把《国徽图案》交给高庄制作模型。
    高庄按国徽征稿要求和周总理关于《国徽图案》修改的建议，按造型设计艺术家的要求，在集体设计的基础上进行修改。他的构思是：“概括地表达我国立国的本质和社会结构的特点”。他参考了我国秦汉铜镜和北魏石刻佛像，采用四十五度锐角线平面立体浅浮雕的技法，发扬了我国雕塑艺术淳厚质朴、深沉雄大的民族形式，使题材内容组成了一个有生命的整体。
    高庄，原名沈士庄，上海宝山人。早年考入上海艺术大学美术系，一九二六——一九二八年入上海中华艺术大学攻读艺术教育专业。他在陈望道校长和陈之佛、陈抱一教授辅导下，成为一名半工半读的研究生，其间积极参加五卅反帝爱国宣传活动。曾经创作展出了《鲁迅》、《朱总司令》、《列宁》、《高尔基》、《毛泽东》等木刻、浮雕石膏像。一九四七年五月，他因参加“反饥饿反内战”示威运动而受到反动派迫害，带着八岁的男孩奔赴解放区，任鲁迅艺术学院美术系主任，遂改名高庄。一九四九年解放北平时，高庄父子随军入城。随即应梁思成邀请，入清华大学营建系教授木工。
    在塑造国徽时，他夜复一夜不能入眠，直到他觉得手指累得要掉下来，疲乏得动不了时才不得不休息一下。他的手，所以具有非凡的表现力，其中的“奥秘”是在他的一颗心，在他的脑海中澎湃汹涌着对祖国母亲无限的爱情，当时四十五岁的高庄看起来与二十多岁小伙子一样健壮。一九五○年八月十八日，高庄参加设计的国徽模型被一致通过。一九五○年九月二十日，中央人民政府毛泽东主席明令公布中华人民共和国国徽及对国徽图案的说明。《人民日报》发表社论，题为《尊敬国徽，爱护国徽》，至此，新中国国徽终于诞生了。
    今天，梁思成、高庄等虽已故去，但他们参与创作的国徽却永远留在亿万人民的心中。
