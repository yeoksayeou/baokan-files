An Arab friend once remarked, "To come to China and not visit Ningxia is like not going to the 'Mecca' of the East; to come to Ningxia and not visit Tongxin is like not going to the 'Kaaba' of Mecca!" Why does the economically and culturally underdeveloped county of Tongxin, with its vast mountains and deep valleys, hold such allure for Muslims around the world?

With the development of the reform and opening-up policy, the demand for Arabic language professionals has become increasingly urgent. In March 1985, Tongxin County, home to 230,000 Muslims, embarked on a challenging journey to establish the first Arabic language school in China. The school now offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, ethnic theory and policy, Islamic religious knowledge, and a brief history of Arabia. It has recruited renowned Arabic language professors and associate professors, as well as teachers with extensive experience in Arabic translation. Among the first batch of graduates, 17 individuals were hired by the State Sports Commission, the Ningxia Islamic Economic and Technical Cooperation Company, and other departments and units. They were sent to Egypt, the Yemen Arab Republic, Kuwait, and other countries to work as translators.

This school has garnered attention from Muslims both domestically and internationally. Muhammad Jima, the Secretary-General of the Asian Department of the World Islamic League, and Saeed Tauiti, the Special Assistant to the President of the Islamic Development Bank, along with Muslim figures from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions, have visited the school for inspections and tours. The Islamic Development Bank donated $790,000 to aid in the construction of this school. Various domestic sectors have also shown great interest. Units and individuals from more than ten provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have written letters, some requesting admission, others seeking to train Arabic language professionals, and some asking for Arabic translators. After visiting the school, Zhu Chongli, Director of the Middle East Studies Institute at Northwest University, praised it as "a jewel in the educational endeavors of ethnic minorities in Northwest China."

    宁夏教育的一颗明珠
    一位阿拉伯朋友感慨地说：“到中国不到宁夏等于没到东方的‘麦加’；到宁夏不到同心，等于没到麦加的‘天房’！”山大沟深、经济文化落后的同心县为什么对世界穆斯林有这么大的吸引力？
    随着改革开放事业的发展，对阿拉伯语人才的需求非常迫切。1985年3月，拥有23万穆斯林的同心县，艰苦创业，首先办起了我国第一所阿拉伯语学校，现在开设阿拉伯语、汉语、民族理论和民族政策、伊斯兰教宗教常识、阿拉伯简史等课程，聘请了全国著名的阿拉伯语教授、副教授以及多年从事阿语翻译的教师讲课。第一届毕业生中，有17人被国家体委、宁夏伊斯兰经济技术合作公司等部门和单位聘用，到埃及、阿拉伯也门共和国、科威特等国当翻译。
    这座学校为国内外穆斯林所瞩目。世界伊斯兰联盟亚洲部秘书长穆罕默德·济玛长老、世界伊斯兰发展银行行长特别事务助理赛迪克·陶乌蒂，以及美国、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、香港等国家和地区的穆斯林人士先后来这里考察参观。世界伊斯兰发展银行赠款79万多美元援建这所学校。国内各界也很关注。全国十几个省、市、自治区的一些单位和个人来信，有的要求上学，有的要求代培阿拉伯语人才，有的要阿拉伯语翻译。西北大学中东研究所所长朱崇礼参观后，称这所学校为“西北少数民族教育事业的一颗明珠”。（尤苏夫　子　月）
