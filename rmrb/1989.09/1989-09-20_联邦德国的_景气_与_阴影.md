While the economic growth rates of other major industrialized countries in the West have significantly slowed down, and they have successively lowered their economic growth forecasts for this year, West Germany's economy stands out. According to the latest figures from the Federal Statistical Office, West Germany's GDP growth rate, following 3.6% last year, has risen to 4.6% in the first half of this year. The president of the Federal Bank (central bank), Karl Otto Pöhl, predicts that West Germany's GDP, after adjusting for inflation, will achieve a real growth rate of 4% this year. If realized, this will be the fastest economic growth rate in West Germany in over a decade.

The most important reason for West Germany's sustained economic boom is the robust growth in exports. Since the beginning of the year, demand for West German products, particularly from Western European countries, has continued to rise. Orders for various products, especially for capital goods, have been pouring in. Additionally, over a period of time, some countries' currencies have appreciated against the Deutsche Mark, making the price increases of West German exported goods smaller than the domestic price increases in these countries, which has also boosted West Germany's exports. Statistics show that in the first seven months of this year, West Germany's export volume reached 373.1 billion Marks, an 18% increase compared to the same period last year.

Many economists have noted that West Germany has returned to a stage of export-led economic growth.

The continuous expansion of domestic investment is also a significant factor driving West Germany's rapid economic growth. To prepare for the European single market, the government, enterprises, and individuals have all accelerated their investment pace. It is estimated that this year, investment in West Germany's construction industry will grow by 18%, investment in the manufacturing industry will increase by 10%, and investment in the machinery industry will increase by 90%. These are rare phenomena in recent years. The continuous increase in investment has strongly driven the prosperity of the industrial and construction sectors.

Of course, from the situation in the first half of the year, West Germany's economy also faces significant hidden dangers, the most important of which is the resurgence of domestic inflation. In the first five months of this year, the prices of industrial products have risen by 3.5%. Including the increase in labor costs, the consumer price index in May rose to 3.1%, although it has slightly decreased in the past month or so, it remains at 2.9%, significantly higher than the 1.6% level of last year.

At the same time, the prices of raw materials and fuels on the international market are showing an upward trend. Since these products are mostly priced in dollars, and given the depreciation of the Deutsche Mark against the dollar this year, West Germany's import prices are likely to rise in the coming period. Additionally, the current difference in inflation rates between West Germany and other countries (currently 5.2% in the United States and 8.3% in the United Kingdom) may also lead to "imported" inflation through international price influences.

Furthermore, since West Germany's export products account for a large proportion of its total products, changes in the economic situation of its trading partners will also affect the domestic economy. Recently, other Western industrialized countries have implemented austerity measures to curb domestic inflation, aiming for a "soft landing" in their economies. This will inevitably affect the further expansion of West Germany's exports. Clearly, these factors cast a shadow over West Germany's booming economy.

　　联邦德国的“景气”与“阴影”
　　孙毅
    当西方其它主要工业国家经济增长速度明显放慢、并纷纷下调今年经济增长预测指标的时候，西德经济却独领风骚。据联邦统计署最近公布，西德国民生产总值增长率继去年达3.6％之后，今年上半年又提高到4.6％。联邦银行（中央银行）行长波尔预计，西德国民生产总值在扣除通货膨胀因素后今年的实际增长率将可达到4％。如若实现，这将是西德十多年来经济增长速度最快的一年。
    西德经济出现持续“景气”的最重要原因是出口增长势头较为旺盛。年初以来，国外特别是西欧国家对西德产品的需求持续增长，各种产品的订单尤其是对资本产品的订单更是源源不断。加之一段时期以来一些国家的货币对马克有所升值，使西德出口商品价格上涨小于这些国家国内物价上涨的幅度，这也促进了西德的出口。据统计，今年头七个月西德的出口额为3731亿马克，与去年同期相比增长了18％。
    许多经济界人士称：目前西德又回到了出口主导型经济增长的阶段。
    西德国内投资的不断扩大也是推动经济较快增长的一个重要因素。为迎接欧洲统一大市场，国家、企业、个人都加快了投资的步伐。据估计，今年西德的建筑业投资将增长18％，加工工业投资将增加10％，制造业投资将增加90％。这都是近年来少有的现象。投资的不断增加，有力地推动了工业和建筑业的兴旺。
    当然，从上半年的情况来看，西德经济也存在着巨大的隐患，其中最重要的是国内通货膨胀又有死灰复燃的迹象。今年1—5月份，工业产品出厂价已上涨了3.5％，加上劳务费用的上涨，5月份的消费价格上涨率已达3.1％，虽然近一个多月来有所下降，但仍为2.9％，大大高于去年1.6％的水平。
    与此同时，国际市场上原料、燃料价格出现上涨趋势，由于这些产品大都以美元标价，在今年以来西德马克兑美元不断贬值的情况下，西德的进口价格在今后一个时期内将会提高。另外，目前西德同其它国家之间的通货膨胀率差异较大（目前美国为5.2％，英国为8.3％），通过国际间价格的影响，还有可能使西德
  “输入”通货膨胀。
    此外，由于西德的出口产品在总产品中所占的比重较大，其贸易伙伴的经济形势变化也会对国内经济产生影响。最近，西方其它工业国家为抑制本国的通货膨胀，都在实施紧缩计划，力求经济上的“软着陆”。这必将影响西德出口的进一步扩大。显然这些都为呈现“景气”的西德经济罩上一层阴影。
