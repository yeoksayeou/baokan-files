Expanding Opening Up and Developing Economic, Technological, Scientific, and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation
—Ten Years of China's Opening Up

	Seasonal Waves

	1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to implement the policy of opening up to the outside world. Ten years have passed since then. In these ten years, we have done a lot of work in this area, achieved remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention, and accumulated rich experience. Practice has proven that this decision is very correct.

	I. The Process and Characteristics of China's Opening Up

	What is the process and characteristics of China's opening up? First, it is to establish a correct concept of opening up. Due to China's long-term state of closure and isolation, there were many doubts in people's minds at the beginning of opening up. At that time, the main task was to eliminate the fear of opening up to the outside world. Later, the main task was to prevent the emergence of various forms of wholesale Westernization. Ten years of successful practice has educated the people, and everyone has personally felt the benefits brought by opening up to the outside world and hopes to further improve the opening up.

	Second, China's opening up is based on objective and subjective conditions, progressing step by step, from partial opening to comprehensive opening, and from opening the door to going out into the world.

	China is vast, and the development of transportation, economy, and culture is very uneven among the regions. Therefore, starting from the needs and actual possibilities, we first focused on the coastal areas to gradually form several regions with different levels of opening up.

	Starting in 1979, we first implemented some favorable policies and flexible measures for opening up to the outside world in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, and established the Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen economic special zones. In 1988, Hainan Province was also designated as an economic special zone, all of which have some functions of export processing zones and free trade zones. In 1984, 14 coastal port cities, including Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Nantong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, and Beihai, were opened up. Most of these cities have also established economic and technological development zones to attract foreign investment to establish enterprises. From 1986 to 1988, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Minnan Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou Triangle, Liaodong Peninsula, Jiaodong Peninsula, and Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou coastal open areas were successively opened up. By this time, China has formed a coastal open area from east to west and from south to north, covering 320,000 square kilometers and nearly 200 million people.

	The Chinese mainland borders the Soviet Union, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, with a border line of more than 20,000 kilometers. Historically, there have been close trade relations. In recent years, the inland and border areas of the central and western regions have carried out various economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with these neighboring countries in expanding foreign trade, utilizing foreign capital, and introducing technology.

	Third, opening up to the outside world and domestic system reform are carried out simultaneously. Opening up to the outside world is an important part of the reform and, to a certain extent, promotes and promotes the reform. After opening up to the outside world, we conducted extensive and in-depth investigations of various countries in the world, analyzed and compared the experiences and lessons of different types of countries in developing their economies, and used them to explore the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics and gradually enrich and improve it through the practice of reform. At the same time, to adapt to the opening up to the outside world, China's foreign economic system has also undergone some reforms (such as the management system of foreign trade and foreign exchange), and some new systems (such as the management of foreign debt and foreign investment) have been established. In the future, we will further reform the systems that do not adapt to the needs of opening up.

	II. Changes and Achievements Brought by Opening Up

	Generally speaking, after ten years of opening up, China has injected vitality into the economy, accelerated development, enhanced strength, improved people's lives, narrowed the gap with industrialized countries in the world, and taken a remarkable step forward in the construction of modernization.

	The achievements of ten years of opening up are roughly reflected in the following six aspects:

	1. Import and export trade has been continuously expanding, and the structure has gradually become more reasonable.

	In 1988, compared with 1979, China's foreign trade volume increased from $20.64 billion to $102.79 billion, nearly four times. Among them, exports increased from $9.74 billion to $47.54 billion, and imports increased from $10.89 billion to $55.25 billion, increasing by 3.9 times and 4.1 times respectively; while the world's export trade volume increased by only 1.92 times. China's share of the world's export trade increased from 0.75% in 1978 to 1.67% in 1988, and the export volume ranking among countries rose from 32nd to 14th. The structure of imported and exported goods has also changed significantly. In the exported goods, the proportion of primary products of agriculture and mining has decreased from 53.5% to 30.4%, while the proportion of manufactured goods has increased from 46.5% to 69.6%. In the imported goods, the proportion of production materials has increased from 81.4% to 82.8%. Among them, the proportion of machinery and equipment increased from 26.6% in 1981 to an average of 30.3% from 1981 to 1988. The continuous expansion of import and export trade and the change of its structure have promoted the rapid growth of the national economy.

	2. The effect of absorbing foreign capital is remarkable.

	The ways in which China absorbs foreign capital can be roughly divided into three categories: the first category is the medium and long-term preferential loans provided by foreign governments and international financial institutions, loans from foreign commercial banks and international financial markets, and bonds issued abroad by China, mainly used in the fields of energy, transportation, infrastructure, industry, agriculture, and education; the second category is to absorb foreign direct investment. From 1979 to 1988, a total of nearly 16,000 foreign-invested enterprises were approved, of which more than 7,000 have started operations, and a total of $12.1 billion in foreign capital has been actually absorbed; the third category is to introduce equipment and production materials from abroad through processing with supplied materials, processing with supplied samples, assembling with supplied parts, and compensatory trade.

	Through the above-mentioned various ways, China has absorbed about $50 billion in foreign capital in ten years, built a large number of energy, transportation, and industrial infrastructure projects, carried out more than ten thousand technological transformations and expansions of old enterprises, increased the production of many scarce products, improved product quality and grade, replaced some imports, expanded exports, and trained a large number of technical and management talents. Especially in the five special economic zones, fourteen coastal open cities, and the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Shandong Peninsula, Liaodong Peninsula, Minnan, and Bohai Bay coastal open areas, large-scale construction has been carried out, creating a good investment environment and laying the foundation for future development.

	3. Advanced science and technology and management methods have been introduced.

	In the past ten years, China has spent about $20 billion to introduce 3,530 major advanced technologies, of which the software part accounts for about 20%. These technologies and equipment are applied to various fields of the national economy, greatly improving China's production capacity and scientific and technological level. Major industries such as petroleum exploration, development and processing, electricity, mining, metallurgy, electronics, machinery, aviation, shipbuilding, locomotives, automobiles, chemicals, textiles, and light industry have made significant progress in equipment manufacturing and process technology, and many departments and products have reached the level of the late 1970s or 1980s. Through academic exchanges between Chinese and foreign scholars and experts, and mutual visits and exchanges between enterprises, as well as joint research, joint design, and joint production, China's technological level and enterprise management level have been greatly improved. With the progress of science and technology, China's inventions and patents obtained internationally and exports have gradually increased. In 1988, the export trade volume of technology reached more than $300 million.

	4. Extensive exchanges in culture, education, science and technology, academia, sports, and arts have been carried out, and the strengths and experiences of various countries have been learned and absorbed.

	In 1988, the number of inbound visitors from 168 countries and regions for tourism, visits, family visits, investigations, and various commercial and exchange activities totaled 31.69 million, 5.5 times that of 1980. The annual tourism foreign exchange income was $2.22 billion, 3.6 times that of 1980. At the same time, China sent more than 60,000 students to study or further their studies abroad, and sent a large number of scholars, experts, government officials, entrepreneurs, technicians, managers, workers to visit, investigate, practice, and participate in various academic conferences abroad to exchange knowledge and experience. These unprecedented extensive and in-depth exchange activities have greatly broadened the vision of the Chinese people, learned from the strengths of other countries, trained a large number of talents, and improved the quality of the majority of workers.

	5. Overseas contracting projects, labor exports, and investing in enterprises abroad have developed rapidly, and foreign aid has also made new achievements.

	China's overseas contracting projects and labor exports have developed from nothing to something and from small to large. By the end of 1988, contracts had been signed with 118 countries and regions for 7,164 projects, with a business volume of $5.89 billion, and a cumulative dispatch of 300,000 labor personnel.

	In recent years, China's activities of investing in enterprises abroad have also increased. By the end of 1988, 526 non-trade enterprises had been established in 79 countries and regions on six continents, with a total investment of $1.9 billion, of which China's investment was $715 million, accounting for 37.6%. These investments are mainly concentrated in resource development, distant sea fishing, and industrial production.

	In the past ten years, China has continued to provide economic and technological assistance to 80 countries in the Third World, sending a total of 450,000 experts and completing 1,233 foreign aid projects.

	6. The exchanges and economic ties between Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan have been strengthened, promoting the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, easing the situation across the Taiwan Strait, and promoting the implementation of the "one country, two systems" concept. The open policy has enhanced the understanding and centripetal force of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwanese compatriots towards the mainland, gradually creating favorable subjective and objective conditions for the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland and the great cause of reunification across the Taiwan Strait.

	III. Firmly Expanding Opening Up

	According to the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we should be more daring in opening up to the outside world and more healthy in opening up to the outside world.

	1. Adhere to the four cardinal principles and adhere to opening up to the outside world.

	The communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly pointed out: "Reform and opening up is the road to a strong country, and we must firmly and unremittingly implement it and never return to the old path of closure and isolation." We must adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world and further expand the breadth and depth of opening up. In terms of breadth, we should implement a policy of opening up to the whole world, that is, to socialist countries, Western developed countries, and Third World countries, those that have not been opened up enough in the past should be further opened up; in the coastal, inland, and continental border areas, those that have not been opened up enough at present should also be expanded. In terms of depth, in addition to various forms of foreign economic trade and scientific and technological and cultural exchanges that have been carried out in the past, we can also lease a piece of land in a specific area to foreign enterprises for investment and operation, transfer or lease part of state-owned and collective enterprises to foreign capital for operation, and so on. Chinese enterprises can also be more open-minded in investing in enterprises abroad or cooperating with foreign enterprises to develop resources, and so on.

	Opening up to the outside world should be carried out on the basis of adhering to the four cardinal principles. In the process of reform and opening up, we should learn some economic management methods of capitalism that are suitable for China, but we should not copy them mechanically, let alone Westernize completely. We should grasp the work of opening up to the outside world with one hand and the work of ideological and political education with the other hand, severely crack down on economic criminal activities, and resist the erosion of decadent capitalist ideas.

	2. From emphasizing quantity and speed to emphasizing quality and efficiency.

	In the past ten years, various departments and places have actively implemented the policy of opening up to the outside world and achieved gratifying results. This must be fully affirmed. However, it must also be seen that due to the lack of experience and the desire for quick success, many places often focus on the increase of quantity and speed, while neglecting the guarantee of quality and the improvement of efficiency. For example, in foreign trade, we pay attention to the quantity and amount of exported goods, while neglecting the quality of goods, contract performance rate, selling price, actual collection rate, and exchange cost; when importing goods, we do not pay attention to the customer's credit, nor do we carefully identify the quality of the goods, resulting in many imported goods of poor quality. In absorbing foreign investment, some places do not refuse anyone who comes, pursuing the number of contracts signed, while neglecting whether the direction of foreign investment is reasonable, the credit of the cooperation partner, and the feasibility study and approval work are also careless.

	It is worth noting that in the past few years, China has imported a large number of non-essential consumer goods, blindly or repeatedly imported many unnecessary machinery and equipment and production lines, not only wasting precious foreign exchange, but also fostering extravagance and unhealthy practices, and some even damaged the development of national industries. In the future, while expanding foreign economic and trade cooperation relations, we should strive to shift from emphasizing quantity and speed to emphasizing quality and efficiency. We should do a good job in the necessary work of replacing imports and domestic production, and strive to turn the trade deficit into a surplus, which is necessary for repaying foreign debts and achieving a virtuous cycle of the national economy. The use of foreign loans should improve the efficiency of use and ensure the ability to repay. In the use of foreign capital, we should also determine the reasonable scale of the country and various places according to needs and possibilities, and according to the ability to digest and match, and choose the best and eliminate the worst under the macro guidance of the national industrial policy.

	In short, we should carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, do a good job in improving quality and efficiency, and make the opening up to the outside world more effective in promoting the development of China's economy.

	3. From regional preferential policies to industrial preferential policies.

	China's opening up has formed a multi-level regional pattern of economic special zones, coastal open cities, coastal economic open areas, and inland areas. In the early stage of opening up, the use of such hierarchical regional preferential policies is conducive to creating a better investment environment in these regions, but it also brings some new problems. Some special zone enterprises use preferential conditions to cross-regional high-price purchases, compete for raw materials, and resell imported goods, and even engage in smuggling, tax evasion, and exchange arbitrage, which damages the overall interests of the state. In the future, we should gradually reduce the differential treatment based on regions and transform it into differential preferential policies based on different industries, which is necessary for rectifying and regulating the order of the circulation sector and guiding the optimization of China's industrial structure and the rational allocation of resources.

	4. Deepen the reform of the system and strengthen the macro-management of foreign economic and trade.

	At present, there are still some unreasonable and uncoordinated places in China's foreign trade, foreign exchange, foreign capital, and foreign debt management systems. There are problems of unclear division of responsibilities, inconsistent rights and responsibilities, unequal competitive conditions, mutual constraints, and loss of benefits in administrative management agencies and various enterprises. We must seriously summarize experience, deepen reform, and propose reform plans that are coordinated with the overall reform of national planning, prices, finance, and banking, so as to both strengthen the state's macro-control and management and maintain the vitality of micro-enterprise economy.

	5. Strengthen the research and formulation of the development strategy and medium and long-term plan for foreign economy.

	In order to guide the overall situation, it is urgent to formulate an active strategy for participating in international division of labor and cooperation and promoting the modernization of China's foreign economic development, based on the trend of world economic and technological development in the 1990s and the early 21st century and China's national conditions. We should determine the import and export commodity structure for each industry in advance and formulate a development strategy that combines import substitution and export substitution. We should further improve the development strategy of coastal areas and at the same time study and formulate the development strategy of the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and other border areas, and finally form a national overall development strategy that includes the layout of major industries in regions, the division of labor and cooperation between coastal, inland, and continental border areas, and the close combination and mutual promotion, so that China's opening up work can be planned and developed in breadth and depth under the unified leadership of the central government.

    扩大对外开放　发展对外经济技术、科学文化的交流和合作
    ——中国对外开放十年
　　季崇威
    1978年，中国共产党十一届三中全会确定我国实行对外开放政策，至今已有十年。十年来，我们在这个方面做了很多工作，取得了举世瞩目的成就，积累了丰富的经验。实践证明，这一决策是十分正确的。
        一、中国对外开放的进程和特点
    中国对外开放的进程和特点是什么呢？首先是确立正确的开放观念。由于我国长期处于闭关锁国状态，在开放初期，人们思想上还抱有不少疑虑，当时主要是破除那些害怕对外开放的思想。后来，则主要是防止滋生各种全盘西化思想。十年的成功实践教育了人民，大家亲身感受到对外开放带来的好处，希望进一步搞好开放。
    第二，中国的对外开放，是根据主客观条件，循序渐进，从部分开放走向全方位开放，从打开大门到走向世界。
    我国地域辽阔，各地区之间交通、经济、文化发展很不平衡。因此，从需要和实际可能出发，先在沿海地区重点推进，逐步形成几个开放程度不同的地区层次。从1979年开始，首先在广东、福建两省，实行若干有利于对外开放的特殊政策、灵活措施，并设立了深圳、珠海、汕头、厦门等经济特区，1988年又将海南省划为经济特区，它们都具有出口加工区和自由贸易区的某些功能。1984年，开放了大连、秦皇岛、天津、烟台、青岛、连云港、南通、上海、宁波、温州、福州、广州、湛江、北海等14个沿海港口城市。在这些城市内，多数还建立了吸收外资办企业的经济技术开放区。1986到1988年，又先后开辟了长江三角洲、珠江三角洲、闽南厦门、漳州、泉州三角地区、辽东半岛、胶东半岛和秦皇岛、唐山、沧州等沿海对外开放区。至此，我国从东向西，从南到北，形成了连线成片，包括32万平方公里，近2亿人口的沿海开放地带。
      中国大陆毗邻苏联、蒙古、朝鲜、巴基斯坦、印度、尼泊尔、缅甸、老挝、越南等国，边境线长达两万余公里，历史上有着密切的通商关系。近年来，中西部内地和边境地区，与这些邻国在扩大外贸、利用外资、引进技术等方面开展了各种经济技术的交流合作。
      第三，对外开放和国内体制改革同时并举，结合进行。对外开放既是改革的重要组成部分，又在一定程度上推动和促进着改革。对外开放后，我们广泛深入地对世界各国进行考察，分析比较不同类型国家发展经济的经验教训，用以探索建设具有中国特色的社会主义道路，并通过改革的实践，使它逐步充实和完善。同时，为了适应对外开放，我国的涉外经济体制也进行了一些改革（如外贸、外汇的管理体制），建立了一些新的制度（如对外债和外商投资的管理），今后还将对不适应开放需要的体制进一步改革。
            二、开放带来的变化和成就
      总的来看，中国经过十年开放，在经济中注入了活力，加快了发展，增强了实力，改善了人民生活，缩小了与世界工业国家的差距，在现代化建设的道路上，迈出了举世瞩目的一步。
      十年对外开放的成就大致表现在以下六个方面：
      1、进出口贸易不断扩大，结构渐趋合理。
      1988年与1979年比较，中国对外贸易总额从206.4亿美
  元增到1027.9亿美元，增长近4倍。其中，出口额从97.4亿美元增至475.4亿美元，进口额从108.9亿美元增至552.5亿美元，分别增加了3.9倍和4.1倍；而同期世界出口贸易额仅增1.92倍。中国出口占世界出口总额的比重，从1978年的0.75％上升到1988年的1.67％，出口额在世界各国中的位次从第32位上升为14位。进出口商品结构也有较大变化。在出口商品中，农矿业初级产品的比重已从53.5％下降到30.4％，工业制成品则从46.5％上升为69.6％。进口商品中生产资料的比重从81.4％上升为82.8％。其中机械设备的比重1981年为26.6％，1981—1988年平均数升为30.3％。进出口贸易的不断扩大及其结构的变化，促进了国民经济的迅速增长。
    2、吸收外资成效显著。
      我国吸收外资方式大体可分为三类：第一类是外国政府、国际金融机构提供的中长期优惠贷款，我向外国商业银行、国际金融市场的借款和在国外发行债券等，主要用于能源、交通、基础设施、工业、农业、文教等领域；第二类是吸收外商直接投资。从1979年到1988年，共批准外商投资企业近1.6万家，其中已开业的7000多家，实际吸收外资121亿美元；第三类是通过来料加工、来样加工、来件装配和补偿贸易，从国外引进设备和生产资料。
      通过上述多种方式，十年内我国共吸收了约500多亿美元的外资，建设了一大批能源、交通、工业基础设施项目，进行了上万个老企业的技术改造和改扩建工程，增产了许多短缺的产品，提高了产品品质和档次，替代了某些进口，扩大了出口，培养了大量技术、管理人才。特别是在五个经济特区，十四个沿海开放城市以及长江三角洲、珠江三角洲、山东半岛、辽东半岛、闽南和渤海湾等沿海开放地带进行了大规模的建设，创造了较好的投资环境，为今后的发展奠定了基础。
    3、引进了先进的科学技术和管理方法。
      我国十年内约花费200多亿美元，引进3530项较重大的先进技术，其中软件部分约占20％左右。这些技术、设备，应用于国民经济的各个领域，使我国生产能力和科学技术水平有了很大提高。各主要产业，如石油勘探开发加工、电力、采矿、冶金、电子、机械、航空、造船、机车、汽车、化工、纺织、轻工业的设备制造和工艺技术都取得了重大进展，不少部门和产品已达到70年代末或80年代的水平。通过中外学者专家的学术交流，和企业间的相互考察交流以至合作研究、合作设计、合作生产等方式，使我国的技术水平和企业的经营管理水平大为提高。随着科学技术的进步，我国创造发明获得的国际专利和输出也逐渐增加，1988年技术出口交易额已达3亿多美元。
    4、广泛开展文化、教育、科技、学术、体育、艺术的交流，学习吸收各国的长处和经验。
    1988年，来自168个国家和地区的旅游、参观、访问、探亲、考察以及从事各项商业及交流活动的入境人数共达3169万人次，为1980年的5.5倍。全年旅游外汇收入22.2亿美元，为1980年的3.6倍。与此同时，我国也派出了6万多名学生赴国外留学或进修、研究，派出了大批学者、专家、政府人员、企业家、技术人员、管理人员、工人赴外国参观、访问、考察、实习，参加各种学术会议，交流知识和经验。这些空前广泛深入的交流活动，极大地开拓了我国人民的视野，学习了别国的长处，培养了大批人才，提高了广大职工的素质。
    5、对外承包工程、劳务出口和在国外投资办企业都有迅速发展，对外援助也有新的成就。
    我国对外承包工程和劳务出口从无到有，由小而大。到1988年底，已同118个国家、地区签订合同7164项，完成营业额58.9亿美元，累计派出劳务人员30万人次。
    近年来，我国在海外投资办企业的活动也日趋增多。1988年止，已在六大洲的79个国家、地区开办非贸易性企业526个，总投资19亿美元，其中我国投资7.15亿美元，占37.6％。这些投资集中在资源开发、远洋捕捞和工业生产等方面。
      十年来，我国继续对第三世界80个国家进行经济技术援助，累计派出专家45万人次，共建成移交援外成套项目1233个。
    6、密切了和香港、澳门、台湾之间的人员往来和经济联系，促进了港澳的繁荣稳定，推动了海峡两岸局势的缓和，促进了“一国两制”构想的实施。开放政策增强了港、澳、台胞对大陆情况的了解和向心力，为香港、澳门回归祖国和海峡两岸的统一大业，逐渐创造了有利的主客观条件。
          三、坚定不移地扩大对外开放
    根据党的十三届四中全会的精神，我们要更大胆地对外开放，更健康地对外开放。
    1、坚持四项基本原则，坚持对外开放。
      党的第十三届四中全会公报中明确指出：“改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移，一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。”我们要坚持执行对外开放政策，进一步扩大开放的广度和深度。从广度来说，要实行面向全球的全方位开放政策，即对社会主义国家、西方发达国家和第三世界国家，过去开放得不够的，要进一步开放；沿海、内地和大陆边境，目前开放得不够的，也要扩大对外开放。从深度来说，除了过去已经进行的各种形式的对外经济贸易和科技文化交流外，还可以把若干特定区域内的成片土地租赁给外国企业投资经营，将部分国营与集体企业有偿转让或租赁给外资经营，等等。中国企业也可更放手地到国外去投资办企业，或与外国企业合作开发资源，等等。
      对外开放应在坚持四项基本原则的基础上进行。在改革开放中，应当学习资本主义若干适于我国的经济管理方法，但不能生搬硬套，更不能全盘西化。要一手抓对外开放，一手抓思想政治工作，严厉打击经济犯罪活动，抵制资本主义腐朽思想的侵蚀。
      2、要从重数量、速度转变为重质量、效益。
      十年来，各个部门、各个地方，积极推行对外开放政策，取得了可喜的成就。这一点必须充分肯定。但是，也必须看到，由于缺乏经验和急于求成的思想指导，许多地方往往侧重于追求数量和速度的增长，而忽视保证质量和提高效益。如在外贸中重视出口商品数量、金额，忽视商品的质量、履约率、售价、实际收汇率和换汇成本；进口商品时不注意客户的信誉，不注意认真鉴别商品的质量，以致不少进口商品质量低劣。在吸收外商投资中，有些地方来者不拒，追求签约数量，忽视外资投向是否合理、合作对象的资信如何，对可行性的研究和审批工作也马虎迁就。
    特别值得注意的是，前几年我国大量进口了非必需的消费品，盲目或重复地进口了许多不必要的机械设备和生产线，不仅浪费了宝贵的外汇，而且助长了奢侈和不正风气，有的还损害了民族工业的发展。今后我们在扩大对外经贸合作关系的同时，要致力于从重数量和速度转变为重质量和效益。要切实做好必要的替代进口和国产化工作，努力扭转外贸逆差为顺差，这是为偿付外债和争取国民经济良性循环所必须做到的。借用外债应提高使用效益，保证偿债能力。在利用外资方面，也应按照需要与可能，根据消化配套能力，确定全国和各地的合理规模，在国家产业政策的宏观指导下择优汰劣。
    总之，要发扬自力更生的精神，认真做好提高质量和效益的工作，使对外开放更加卓有成效地促进我国经济的发展。
    3、要从地区的倾斜政策转变为产业的倾斜政策。
      我国对外开放已形成经济特区——沿海开放城市——沿海经济开放区——内地这样的多层次地区格局。在开放初期，采用这样分层次的地区倾斜优惠政策，有利于使这些地区创造较好的投资环境，但也带来一些新问题。某些特区企业利用优惠条件，跨区高价抢购货源，争夺原材料，倒卖进口商品，甚至发生走私、漏税套汇等弊端，损害了国家整体利益。今后应逐步淡化按地区的差别待遇，转变为按不同产业的差别倾斜政策，这对治理整顿流通领域的秩序，引导我国产业结构的优化和资源的合理配置，都是必要的。
      4、要深化体制改革，加强对外经贸的宏观管理工作。
      目前我国外贸、外汇、外资、外债的管理体制中，还存在一些不够合理、相互不配套的地方。在行政管理机构和各类企业中存在着政企不分、责权利不一致、竞争条件不平等、互相制肘、肥水外流等问题。必须认真总结经验、深化改革，提出与国家计划价格、财政、金融等整体改革相配套的改革方案，以便既加强国家宏观的调控管理，又保持企业微观经济的活力。
      5、要加强研究制订对外经济的发展战略和中长期规划。
      为了指导全局，亟需根据90年代和二十一世纪前期世界经济技术发展趋势和我国国情，制订积极参与国际分工协作，促进我国现代化的对外经济发展战略。要及早确定分产业的进出口商品结构，制订进口替代和出口替代相结合的发展战略。要进一步完善沿海地区的发展战略，同时研究制订东北、西北、西南等边境地区的对外发展战略，最终形成包括主要产业的地区布局，沿海、内地、大陆边境地区分工协作、紧密结合、相互促进的全国整体对外发展战略，使我国的对外开放工作，在中央的统一领导下，有计划地向广度和深度发展。
