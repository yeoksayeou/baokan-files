Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, September 13th.

The Dalian Consumer Association recently issued a "yellow card" to "Kena," "Bole," and "Jiameluo" brands of refrigerators, declaring them as unpopular products.

Recently, the Dalian Consumer Association, through consumer complaints and field investigations, found that these three brands of refrigerators have numerous issues. Specifically, these include the "Kena" brand produced by the Tianjin Refrigerator Factory, the "Jiameluo" brand produced by the Shashi Refrigerator Factory in Hubei Province, and the "Bole" brand produced by the state-owned (Nanjing) Xinlian Mechanical Factory. Consumers jokingly refer to them as: "Kena" is not lovable, "Bole" is truly not joyful, and "Jiameluo" has become a household worry.

Early this year, the "Kena" brand refrigerator, which claimed to have won the international Leipzig Gold Award and was "loved by all," was sold in Dalian. Consumers, attracted by its reputation, rushed to buy it. However, shortly after, both the selling enterprises and consumers exclaimed that they had been deceived. The Dalian Friendship Store purchased 1,400 units, with a 40% rate of unqualified products upon opening the boxes.

　　大连消费者协会宣布三种电冰箱不受欢迎
    据新华社大连9月13日电　（记者阎平）大连市消费者协会日前向“可耐”、“伯乐”、“家美乐”三种牌号电冰箱亮出“黄牌”，宣布其为不受欢迎的产品。
    最近，大连市消费者协会通过受到消费者投诉、走访调查，了解到三种牌号的电冰箱问题较多，即天津市电冰箱总厂生产的可耐牌电冰箱、湖北省沙市电冰箱厂生产的家美乐牌电冰箱和国营（南京）新联机械厂生产的伯乐牌电冰箱。消费者戏曰：“可耐”不可爱、“伯乐”真不乐、“家美乐”成了家家愁。
    今年初，号称获国际莱比锡金奖、“人见人爱”的可耐牌电冰箱在大连销售，消费者慕名争购，可事隔不久，经销企业和消费者便惊呼上当。大连市友谊商店进货1400台，开箱不合格率为40％。
