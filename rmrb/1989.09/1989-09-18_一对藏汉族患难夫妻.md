A family composed of Lu Xue Tian and Bian Ma Yang Zong, known as the "Unity Family," has weathered over 30 years of storms and is now more harmonious and happy than ever.

Recently, we basked in the sunshine of the "Sunshine City" and visited the couple at the General Hospital of the Tibet Military Region.

This is a modest single-story house. As soon as we entered, the rich aroma of butter tea filled the air. On the walls hung a bright "Five Good Family" certificate.

The female host, Bian Ma Yang Zong, welcomed us with the characteristic warmth of a Tibetan. Butter tea, barley wine, and curd... we were enveloped in a warm and happy atmosphere.

"At that time, I was not yet 20 years old. Due to life's hardships, I followed my uncle from my hometown in Mangkang, Sichuan, to Lhasa to work, joining a civilian construction team for the army. By chance, I met Lu Xue Tian, who was then a platoon leader in the army. After getting to know each other, we fell in love." Yang Zong recalled, lost in sweet memories.

In 1956, Lu Xue Tian and Bian Ma Yang Zong held their wedding ceremony in Lhasa. After marriage, the couple loved and supported each other, understanding and forgiving each other. Neighbors praised them highly.

However, fate is unpredictable. Just as Lu Xue Tian and Bian Ma Yang Zong were enjoying their newlywed bliss, a great misfortune struck—Lu Xue Tian was injured in an accident during construction. Under the care of the army leadership, Lu Xue Tian was transferred to Lanzhou and other places for treatment, undergoing nine surgeries. Although his life was saved, his right eye was lost.

Yang Zong had not yet recovered from this heavy blow when, after recovering from his injuries, Lu Xue Tian returned to work on the construction site and was injured again, leaving his left leg disabled.

"Divorce him! You are still young and cannot spend your life with a disabled person." Someone advised Yang Zong. Yang Zong said: Lu Xue Tian's body may be disabled, but his heart is intact. He deserves my love and care.

Under the sympathetic gaze of others, Bian Ma Yang Zong took on the burden of the family. Lu Xue Tian spent several years in the hospital, and Yang Zong raised the children while caring for her husband.

Life continued to test this Han-Tibetan couple. In 1966, Bian Ma Yang Zong returned to her hometown in Mangkang, Sichuan, to visit her family. On the way, she was involved in a car accident, severely injuring her head and waist. Upon receiving the accident report, Lu Xue Tian, despite his own disabilities, rushed to the scene and brought his wife back to Lhasa for treatment. Yang Zong was bedridden for over half a year, and Lu Xue Tian fed her, washed her clothes, bathed her, and made delicious butter tea and tsampa. Love deepened between this couple facing hardships.

"In our most difficult times, the Party organization and our Tibetan and Han neighbors always provided timely warmth." The couple repeated this phrase.

Lu Xue Tian stood up again with the help of a cane, and Bian Ma Yang Zong's condition gradually improved. The hospital party committee approved their return to work. Lu Xue Tian became the director of the hospital's service center, and Bian Ma Yang Zong was also a hospital employee. The husband received multiple awards for his merits, and the wife was named a "Five Good Worker" five times.

Now, Lu Xue Tian and Bian Ma Yang Zong are both over fifty. Their three children have grown up and become talents contributing to the country. They are filial, work hard, and love this family. The elderly couple enjoys the joy of family life.

　　一对藏汉族患难夫妻
　　刘励华　薛晓康
    由鹿学田、边玛央宗组成的“团结族”家庭，经过30多年风风雨雨，如今是更加美满和谐。
    前些日子，我们沐浴着“日光城”的艳阳，来到西藏军区总医院采访这对汉藏夫妻。
    这是一间不算宽畅的平房。一进屋，浓郁的酥油香扑鼻而来。屋内的墙壁上挂着一张耀眼的“五好家庭”奖状。
    女主人边玛央宗以藏族人特有的热情款待我们。酥油茶、青稞酒、奶渣……我们便被包围在一种温暖幸福的氛围中。
    “那时，我不到20岁。由于受生活所迫，随舅父从老家四川芒康来到拉萨做工，参加了部队建设营房的民工队。一个偶然的机会，我与当时在部队任排长的鹿学田认识了。经过彼此了解，我们相爱了。”央宗讲着，沉浸在甜蜜的回忆之中。
    1956年，鹿学田、边玛央宗在拉萨举行了婚礼。婚后，夫妻相亲相爱，互相体谅。左邻右舍，无不夸赞。
    可是，天有不测风云。正当鹿学田、边玛央宗沉浸在新婚生活的甜蜜之际，不料一场大祸从天而降——鹿学田在施工中摔伤。在部队领导的关心下，鹿学田先后转入兰州等地治疗，动了9次手术。虽然生命保住了，但是右眼失明了。
    央宗还未从这一沉重打击中解脱出来，伤好后坚持到工地上班的鹿学田又一次负伤，左腿致残。
      “离婚吧！你还年轻，总不能守着一个残废人过一辈子。”有人这样劝央宗。央宗说：鹿学田的身体虽然伤残了，但心却是完好的，他应该得到我的爱情与照顾。
    在人们同情的目光下，边玛央宗挑起了家庭重担。鹿学田住进医院好几年，央宗一面抚养孩子，一面到医院照料丈夫。
    生活对这对藏汉夫妻继续进行严酷考验。1966年，边玛央宗回老家四川芒康探亲，途中遇到翻车事故，头部和腰部被严重摔伤。鹿学田接到事故通报后，拖着病残的身体赶到出事地点，将妻子接回拉萨治疗。央宗半年多时间卧床不起，鹿学田每天为她喂饭，洗衣、擦澡、做可口的酥油茶、糌粑。爱，在这对苦难夫妻身上更真更深。
      “在我们最困难的时候，党组织和周围的藏汉族同志总是及时送来温暖。”夫妻俩反复说着这句话。
    鹿学田拄着拐杖重新站了起来，边玛央宗的病情也日渐好转。医院党委批准了他俩参加工作。鹿学田担任总医院服务社主任，边玛央宗也是医院的职工。丈夫多次立功受奖，妻子5次被评为“五好职工”。
    如今，鹿学田、边玛央宗已年过半百。膝下的3个儿女已长大成人，成为国家的建设人才。他们孝顺父母、工作积极，热爱这个家庭。老俩口愉快地享受着天伦之乐。
