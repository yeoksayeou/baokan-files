This year, the economic construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has turned a new page, with the three key projects of the region, known as the "rejuvenation projects," being implemented simultaneously.

The Erlian Oil Field, located in the Xilingol Grassland, has already built an annual production capacity of 800,000 tons. This year, it can produce 350,000 tons of crude oil. A 362-kilometer oil pipeline has been completed. The Inner Mongolia Refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 1 million tons, has completed its preliminary work and is about to start full-scale construction.

The large-scale Inner Mongolia Fertilizer Plant, which is part of the petroleum development project, is adjacent to the refinery and is also about to start construction.

The "Northern China Irrigation Project" in the Hetao Plain, assisted by the International Development Association, has started construction. This project, consisting of 13 supporting projects, can benefit 3.153 million mu of farmland. The 300,000 mu farmland development project in the southern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains has also entered the construction phase.

These three projects are called "rejuvenation projects" by the people of Inner Mongolia. Once completed, they will bring about three major changes:

* The region will achieve basic self-sufficiency in grain, no longer needing to import from other provinces;
* The region's fiscal self-sufficiency rate will significantly increase or achieve self-reliance;
* The living standards of urban and rural residents in the region will reach the national average or above (calculated by per capita national income).

At the end of 1987, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Session of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee was held. In accordance with the requirements of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the economic development strategy for taking the second step, the meeting seriously discussed and studied the selection of the best breakthrough point for the resource transformation strategy and proposed three near-term goals and these three "rejuvenation projects."

The above projects have been approved by the State Council, and the entire region is now fully committed to implementing them.

　  选准突破口　走好第二步
　　内蒙古实施三项翻身工程
    本报讯　今年以来，内蒙古自治区经济建设掀开了新的一页，被称为翻身工程的自治区三项重点工程同时抓紧实施。
    位于锡林郭勒草原的二连油田，已建成年产80万吨的生产能力，今年可产原油35万吨，362公里的输油管道已经建成；年加工能力百万吨的内蒙古炼油厂前期准备工作就绪，即将全面开工。
    与石油开发配套的内蒙古化肥厂大型工程与炼油厂毗邻，也即将开工。
    由国际开发协会援助的“中国北方灌溉项目”河套平原灌区排灌配套工程已经动工。这项由13项配套工程组成的排灌系统可使315.3万亩农田受益；大兴安岭岭南30万亩农田开发工程也进入施工阶段。
  这三项工程被内蒙古人民群众称为“翻身工程”。建成后，将会给内蒙古带来三大变化：
    全区粮食基本自给，再不用从外省调入；
    全区财政自给率大大提高或自立；
    全区城乡人民生活水平能够达到全国中等以上水平（按人均国民产值计算）。
    1987年底，内蒙古自治区党委召开了四届五次全委扩大会议，按照十三大关于经济发展战略走好第二步的要求，认真讨论研究，选择资源转换战略的最佳突破口，提出了近期三项奋斗目标和这三项“翻身工程”。
    上述工程项目，业经国务院批准，目前全区上下正全力以赴，抓紧实施。（李马钦）
