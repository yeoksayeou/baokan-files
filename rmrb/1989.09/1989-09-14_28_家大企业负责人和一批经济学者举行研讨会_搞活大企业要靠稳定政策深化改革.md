Currently, the situation and future development have clearly placed the important position and role of large and medium-sized enterprises before us. How to improve and revitalize large key enterprises? Leaders from 28 famous large enterprises in China, some economists, and representatives from relevant departments gathered in Beijing at the Capital Iron and Steel Company from September 12 to 14 to discuss strategies.

This "Symposium on Strategies to Revitalize Large Key Enterprises" was jointly organized by the China Enterprise Management Association, the Development Research Center of the State Council, the Capital Entrepreneurs Club, and the Capital Iron and Steel Company. Comrades Yuan Baohua, Lü Dong, Zhang Yanning, Chen Jinhua, Zhang Pan, Gu Ming, and Zhou Guanwu attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

At the symposium, there was a general consensus that revitalizing large enterprises requires work from two aspects. From a macro perspective, the state and various levels of government should pay attention to the stability and continuity of basic policies and guidelines, giving enterprises a "peace of mind." Currently, under the severe inflation, large enterprises universally face difficulties in energy, transportation, raw materials, funds, and other aspects. This makes it even more necessary to stabilize public sentiment and unite to overcome difficulties, ensuring that rectification and reorganization measures are effective. At the same time, it is necessary to address the previous period's issues of "small enterprises squeezing out large ones" and "small enterprises thriving while large ones do not," firmly adopting necessary policies to tilt support towards large and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the socialist economy and the main pillars of national fiscal revenue. From a micro perspective, it is necessary to deepen reforms, strengthen the enterprise's incentive and constraint mechanisms, and combine them with the operating mechanism. Under the principle of aligning the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals, it is better to give full play to the advantages of socialist public ownership enterprises.

Regarding the enterprise contract responsibility system, the speakers fully affirmed its important role in revitalizing enterprises, developing production, and maintaining social stability. Some enterprise representatives also used their own practices to verify this evaluation. Regarding how to recognize and solve the defects and problems existing in the implementation of the contract system, the speakers also analyzed and evaluated from different angles, discussed, and proposed active suggestions. They hope that any major reform measures that are introduced will have scientific plans and pilot tests, and necessary preparatory work will be done.

　　28家大企业负责人和一批经济学者举行研讨会
　　搞活大企业要靠稳定政策深化改革
    本报讯　记者艾丰报道：目前形势和今后发展都把大中型企业的重要地位和作用进一步清晰地摆在人们面前。如何搞好搞活大型骨干企业？我国28家著名大企业的负责人、一些经济学者，还有一些主管部门的代表，12日至14日聚会在北京的首都钢铁公司，研讨对策。
    这次“搞活大型骨干企业对策研讨会”是由中国企业管理协会、国务院发展研究中心、首都企业家俱乐部和首都钢铁公司联合举办的。袁宝华、吕东、张彦宁、陈锦华、张盘、顾明、周冠五等同志参加了会议并发了言。
    研讨会上比较一致的看法是：搞活大型企业要从两个方面做工作。从宏观上看，国家和各级政府要注意执行基本方针政策的稳定性和连续性，给企业吃“定心丸”。目前，在通货膨胀严重的情况下，大企业普遍遇到能源、交通、原材料、资金等多方面的困难，这就更需要人心稳定、团结一致地突破难关，使治理、整顿措施见诸实效。同时要针对前一时期存在的“以小挤大”、“小活大不活”的问题，坚定地从多方面采取必要的倾斜政策，保护和扶植作为社会主义经济骨干和国家财政收入主要支柱的大中型企业。从微观上讲，要通过深化改革，强化企业的激励机制和约束机制相结合的经营机制，在国家、企业、个人三者利益一致的原则下，更好地发挥社会主义公有制企业的优越性。
    对于企业承包经营责任制，发言的同志对它在搞活企业、发展生产、社会安定等方面所起的重要作用，给予充分肯定，一些企业的代表还用自己企业的实践证实了这个估价。对于如何认识和解决承包制在推行过程中存在的缺陷和问题，发言者也从不同的角度做了不同的分析和评价，展开了讨论，提出了积极的建议，希望凡大的改革措施出台，都要有科学方案和经过试点，并做好必要的准备工作。
