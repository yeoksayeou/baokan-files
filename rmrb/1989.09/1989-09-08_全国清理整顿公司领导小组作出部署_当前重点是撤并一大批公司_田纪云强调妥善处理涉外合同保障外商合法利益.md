The rectification and reorganization of companies is a crucial task. The current focus is on dissolving and merging a large number of companies. Today, the nationwide company rectification and reorganization leading group held a meeting in Zhongnanhai for the heads of the leading groups for company rectification and reorganization in various departments under the Central Committee and the State Council. The meeting made the above deployment.

More than 200 relevant officials attended the meeting. Officials from the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry reported on their progress in rectifying and reorganizing companies.

Vice Premier and Head of the Nationwide Company Rectification and Reorganization Leading Group Tian Jiyun pointed out at the meeting that resolutely dissolving and merging a large number of companies is the first requirement for further rectification and reorganization. In recent years, the development of companies has been out of control, with too many and too chaotic operations. Some companies have been mismanaged, and a few individuals have used their positions to embezzle, steal, speculate, and engage in bribery. Some companies have essentially become breeding grounds for corruption, seriously disrupting the construction of a clean government and the socialist economic order, exacerbating social inequities, and affecting social stability. The public has strongly reacted. Whether we have the resolve to cut down those companies that are unnecessary to exist has become an important indicator of whether the public has confidence in the fight against corruption and in the Party and government.

Tian Jiyun said that the Central Committee and the State Council require all localities and departments to consider the overall situation and the long-term interests of the Party and the state, rather than emphasizing local interests at the expense of the overall situation. Companies that should be dissolved and merged according to regulations must be resolutely dissolved and merged without mercy. We must not play the "relationship game" or go easy on anyone. We must not be afraid to offend people and must not just go through the motions. Central and state organs must set an example in the dissolution and merger of companies.

Tian Jiyun said that the targets for dissolution and merger are companies that do not meet social needs, are redundant, lack conditions, have serious lawlessness and disorder, and have been operating poorly for a long time, are severely loss-making, and are already insolvent. The focus is on cutting down companies run by party and government agencies at all levels, as well as companies in the circulation sector that are overabundant and excessively engaged in commercial wholesale, foreign trade, material supply, and financial activities.

Tian Jiyun required all localities and departments to focus on dissolving and merging companies this year, and by the end of the year, the work of dissolving and merging companies should be basically completed. At the same time, the follow-up work of dissolving and merging companies must be carefully handled to avoid or minimize losses on all sides. All contracts that have already been signed by companies that have been decided to be dissolved and merged should be strictly fulfilled. Especially for foreign-related contracts, they must be properly handled to ensure that the legal interests of foreign investors are not affected.

In further rectifying and reorganizing companies, Tian Jiyun required serious investigation and handling of illegal and disciplinary cases, especially those involving county-level and above leaders with significant social impact.

Finally, Tian Jiyun also emphasized the importance of re-examination.

    全国清理整顿公司领导小组作出部署
    当前重点是撤并一大批公司
    田纪云强调妥善处理涉外合同保障外商合法利益
    本报北京9月8日讯　记者计泓赓、新华社记者陈芸报道：坚决撤并一大批公司，是进一步清理整顿公司的第一条要求。今天全国清理整顿公司领导小组在中南海召开中央、国家机关各部门清理整顿公司领导小组负责人会议作出上述部署。
    200多位有关方面负责人参加了会议。交通部、轻工业部、化学工业部的负责同志在会上介绍了他们清理整顿公司的情况。
    国务院副总理、全国清理整顿公司领导小组组长田纪云在会上指出，近年来公司发展失控，过多过滥，一些公司经营混乱，少数人利用职权贪污、盗窃，投机倒把，行贿受贿。有的公司实际上已成为滋生腐败现象的一个温床，严重干扰了廉政建设和社会主义经济秩序，加剧了社会分配不公的矛盾，影响了社会安定，广大群众反映强烈。能不能下决心砍掉那些没有必要存在的公司，已经成为人民群众对惩治腐败有没有信心，对党和政府有没有信心的一个重要标志。
    田纪云说，党中央、国务院要求各地方、各部门一定要从大局出发，从党和国家的整体利益、长远利益出发，不能片面强调局部利益而妨害大局。对于按规定该撤并的公司要坚决撤并，毫不留情，不能讲“关系学”，不能高抬贵手，要不怕得罪人，决不能“雨过地皮湿”，走过场。中央、国家机关在撤并公司问题上，一定要起表率作用。
    田纪云说，撤并公司的对象是那些不符合社会需要、重复设置、不具备条件、严重违法乱纪的公司，以及长期经营不善、严重亏损、已经资不抵债的公司，重点是砍掉各级党政机关开办的公司，流通领域中过多、过滥的从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司。
    田纪云要求各地方、各部门在今年内，要把清理整顿工作的重点放在撤并公司上，到年底应当把撤并公司的工作基本搞完。同时，必须过细地抓好撤并公司的善后工作，避免或尽量减少各方面的损失。凡已确定撤并的公司，原已签定的合同，都应认真履行。特别是涉外合同，更要妥善处理，保障外商合法利益不受影响。
    在进一步清理整顿公司中，田纪云要求认真查处违法违纪案件，特别是查处社会影响大的有县级以上领导干部参与的大案要案。
    最后，田纪云还强调了复查问题。
