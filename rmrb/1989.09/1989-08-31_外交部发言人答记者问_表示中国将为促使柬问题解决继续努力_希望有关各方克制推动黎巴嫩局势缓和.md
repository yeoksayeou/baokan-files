Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st.

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today stated that China will, together with all justice-loving countries, continue to strive for a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable solution to the Cambodian issue.

At today's afternoon press conference, a journalist asked how China evaluates the international conference on the Cambodian issue held in Paris.

The spokesperson said, "The international conference on the Cambodian issue in Paris has been ongoing for a whole month. Most of the participating countries have done a lot of work and made due efforts to strive for a comprehensive agreement to solve the Cambodian issue, which has played a certain role in promoting a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue. However, due to the lack of sincerity and rigid attitude of Vietnam and the Phnom Penh authorities, the conference has not made substantial progress."

When asked to comment on the recent developments in Lebanon, the spokesperson said, "The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the latest developments in the Lebanese situation and the recent escalation of the artillery battle in Beirut. We sincerely hope that the relevant parties will adopt a restrained attitude, work together, and push the Lebanese situation towards easing, avoiding any measures that may lead to tension."

A journalist requested the spokesperson to comment on the South Korean authorities' arrest of the South Korean student representative Lin Xiuqing, who participated in the Pyongyang World Youth Festival, and the possibility of her being sentenced to death.

The spokesperson said, "We believe that exchanges between North and South Korea, including student exchanges, will help increase mutual understanding and promote the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea. Currently, Lin Xiuqing's fate is worrying, and we hope that the handling of this matter will not have adverse effects on improving North-South Korean relations."

    外交部发言人答记者问
    表示中国将为促使柬问题解决继续努力
    希望有关各方克制推动黎巴嫩局势缓和
    新华社北京8月31日电　外交部发言人今天在此间表示，中国将同所有主持正义的国家一道，为促使柬埔寨问题全面、公正、合理地解决继续努力。
    在今天下午举行的新闻发布会上，有记者问，中国如何评价在巴黎召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议。
    这位发言人说，关于柬埔寨问题的巴黎国际会议开了整整一个月。大多数与会国家为争取达成一项全面解决柬埔寨问题的协议，进行了大量的工作，作出了应有的努力，对谋求全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题起了一定的推动作用。但是，由于越南和金边当局缺乏诚意，态度僵硬，致使会议未取得实质性进展。
    在被问及对黎巴嫩最近局势的发展有何评论时，发言人说，中国政府对黎巴嫩局势的最新发展及近来贝鲁特炮战的升级极为关切，殷切希望有关各方采取克制态度，协同努力，推动黎局势趋向缓和，避免采取任何可能导致局势紧张的措施。
    有记者要求发言人对南朝鲜当局逮捕了参加平壤世界青年联欢节的南朝鲜大学生代表林秀卿，并可能对她判处死刑一事作出评论。
    发言人说，“我们认为，朝鲜北南双方人员交流，包括学生交往，有助于增加双方的了解和促进朝鲜的和平统一事业。目前林秀卿的命运令人担忧，我们希望对此事的处理不给改善朝鲜北南关系带来不利的后果。”
