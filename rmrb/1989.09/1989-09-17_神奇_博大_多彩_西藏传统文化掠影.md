On the "roof of the world," the mysterious land of the Tibetan Plateau, a traditional culture with a rich highland flavor, strong local characteristics, and bright snowy colors has emerged. Its architecture, historical works, Buddhist classics, murals, sculptures, philosophy, Tibetan medicine, astronomy, music, dance, and drama have all reached a very high level.

Tibet is known as the "sea of songs and dances." The Tibetan people are good at singing and dancing, producing countless folk poems, literary poems, and aphoristic poems. There is also the unique and most romantic Tibetan music in the world. The world's longest epic, the "Epic of King Gesar," was born on this mysterious land. It is praised by the international Tibetan studies community as an encyclopedia for studying ancient Tibet and can be compared with the "Homeric Epics."

Tibetan opera, as people commonly refer to it, is a comprehensive art form that expresses story content through singing, dancing, and recitation. It is said to have a history of over a thousand years. Tibetan opera has complete plots, varied melodies, graceful and healthy movements, and clear and melodious recitations, making it widely popular throughout the Tibetan region. Based on the widespread popularity of Tibetan opera, an annual Tibetan opera arts festival – the Shoton Festival – has been formed.

The world's highest palace and historical museum, the Potala Palace, is an outstanding representative of Tibetan architecture and mural art. It has become a symbol of Tibet.

　　神奇·博大·多彩
　　——西藏传统文化掠影
    在“世界屋脊”西藏高原这片神奇的土地上，产生出了具有醇厚的高原气息、浓重的乡土特质和明丽的雪域色彩的传统文化。它的建筑艺术、历史著作、佛教经典、壁画、雕塑、哲学、藏医藏药、天文历算、音乐、舞蹈、戏剧等，都达到了相当高的水平。
    西藏号称“歌舞海洋”，藏族人民能歌善舞，产生了无数的民间诗歌、文人诗歌和格言诗，还有独一无二的最富浪漫色彩的西藏音乐。世界上最长的史诗《格萨尔王传》，就产生在这片神奇的土地上，被国际藏学界誉为研究古代西藏的百科全书，它足以跟《荷马史诗》相媲美。
    西藏的戏剧，即人们常说的藏戏，是一种以歌舞念白形式表现故事内容的综合性艺术，据考证已有一千多年的历史。藏戏故事情节完整，唱腔变化较多，动作舒展健美，念白清越动听，在整个藏区流传甚广。在藏戏广为流传的基础上，形成了一年一度的藏戏艺术节——雪顿节。
    世界上最高的宫殿兼历史博物馆——布达拉宫，是藏族建筑、壁画艺术的杰出代表，它已成为西藏的象征。
