China is an ancient civilization with a long history and vast territory. Despite numerous invasions, China has not perished, and despite countless hardships, it has not declined. This is all due to the indomitable spirit and heroic struggles of our great people.

In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, marking a new era in history. Over the past 40 years, despite some mistakes and setbacks, we have solved the problem of feeding and clothing over 10 billion people, and our economic strength has grown tremendously. Especially in the past 10 years of reform and opening up, our achievements have been remarkable.

The people of Macao have a glorious patriotic tradition, celebrating National Day enthusiastically every year, which embodies the deep affection of the Chinese people. Lin Zexu once said, "If it benefits the country, I will risk my life; how can I avoid it for personal gain or loss?" This spirit of devotion and patriotism is truly inspiring.

Since the joint declaration on the Macao issue was signed by China and Portugal last year, the Basic Law Drafting Committee was established, and this year, the Basic Law Consultative Committee was formed. According to the principles of "one country, two systems," "Macao people governing Macao," and "50 years without change," Macao has maintained social stability and a good economic situation. Although there may be temporary differences in opinions on specific issues, this does not negate the fundamental consensus on loving the country and loving Macao.

Currently, Macao has a certain economic foundation and extensive international connections. It is also a beneficiary of the "Generalized System of Preferences." In the future, Macao will continue to leverage its unique advantages. It is estimated that after several major construction projects are completed, they will drive the development of related industries to varying degrees, making the city's functions more diversified. This will continue to promote Macao's economic growth, consolidate and enhance Macao's status as a free port, and strengthen its ability to compete internationally.

"Drinking water, thinking of its source," Macao's water supply and part of its electricity come from the mainland. The people of Macao strongly feel that their fate is tied to that of the motherland, sharing its glory and shame. During the transitional period, it is our common wish to work hard to maintain Macao's stability, prosperity, and development. It can be foreseen that with the resolution of the Macao issue, Macao's future will be even better!

### 澳门的前景将更好

    澳门的前景将更好
    澳门日报社社长
    我国是世界上历史悠久、幅员辽阔的文明古国。我国屡遭侵略而未亡、历尽劫难而不衰，这都是我们伟大的人民不屈不挠英勇奋斗的结果。
    1949年，中华人民共和国诞生，开创了历史的新纪元。40年来，虽有失误、挫折，但我们解决了10多亿人民的温饱，经济实力获得了巨大的增长，特别是10年的改革开放，成就举世瞩目。
    澳门同胞具有光辉的爱国传统，每年热烈庆祝国庆，凝聚了炎黄子孙的赤子之心。林则徐有名句：“苟利国家生死以；岂因祸福趋避之！”这种竭智尽忠、以身报国的崇高爱国主义精神，发人深思。
    自从前年中葡两国关于澳门问题联合声明签署后，去年成立基本法起草委员会，今年成立基本法咨询委员会。按照“一国两制”、“澳人治澳”、“50年不变”及其一系列方针政策，澳门社会稳定，经济形势很好。尽管人们对一时一事的观点可能有暂时的分歧，但并不否定在爱祖国、爱澳门的根本目标上的一致。
    目前澳门已有一定的经济基础，国际联系广泛，而且是
  “普通优惠税制”的受惠地区。今后澳门将继续发挥本身的特点和优势。估计几项大型建设工程次第竣工后，将从各方面不同程度地带动有关行业的发展，使城市功能多元化，继续促进澳门经济的增长，巩固和提高澳门自由港的地位，加强参与国际竞争的能力。
      “饮水思源”，澳门的食水和部分电力都是来自祖国的供应。澳门同胞强烈地感受到同祖国命运相连，荣辱与共。在过渡时期，努力维持澳门的稳定、繁荣和发展，是我们共同的愿望。可以预见，随着澳门问题的圆满解决，澳门的前景将更好！
