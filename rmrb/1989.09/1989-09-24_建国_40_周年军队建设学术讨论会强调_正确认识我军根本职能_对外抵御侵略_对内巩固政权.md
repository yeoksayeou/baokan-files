The academic discussion on military construction for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation concluded today in Beijing. Experts and scholars from various major units of the entire army studied and discussed theoretical and practical issues related to military construction in the new era.

The four-day academic discussion concluded that over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, our military has achieved great accomplishments and accumulated rich experience in military construction. However, the international climate and domestic environment have presented many new challenges for the construction of a standing army. Participants pointed out that correctly understanding the military's functions of defending against external aggression and consolidating internal power is an important issue that needs to be studied and resolved in the construction of a standing army. In recent years, some theoretical views have emerged that deny the military's internal functions. The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has further deepened our understanding of the military's fundamental functions. The military's fundamental functions must include both external and internal aspects. Externally, it is a steel wall defending against aggression, consolidating national defense, and safeguarding national security and territorial integrity. Internally, it is a pillar against subversion, consolidating power, safeguarding the socialist system, and people's democratic dictatorship. Historically, over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, the military has performed multiple functions of suppressing bandits and rebellions, all of which have achieved good results. In reality, opposing the Western strategy of "peaceful evolution," overcoming difficulties encountered in the country's reforms, and ensuring a stable and united situation also require the military to regard its internal functions as fundamental. The suppression of the Beijing counter-revolutionary rebellion further proves that the military's internal functions not only cannot be weakened but must be further strengthened. Internationally, many countries regard consolidating power as the fundamental function of the military. The internal functions of our military are also in line with the requirements of the constitution.

The academic discussion, hosted by the Military Science Academy, also explored issues related to the construction and management of a standing army.

    建国40周年军队建设学术讨论会强调
    正确认识我军根本职能
    对外抵御侵略　对内巩固政权
    新华社北京9月23日电　（记者徐京跃、通讯员樊昊）建国40周年军队建设学术讨论会今天在北京结束。来自全军各大单位的专家学者研究探讨了新时期军队建设的理论和实践问题。
    为期四天的学术讨论会认为，建国40年来，我军建设取得了伟大的成就，积累了丰富的建军经验，而国际的大气候和国内的小气候也给常备军建设提出许多新课题。与会者指出，正确认识军队对外对内职能就是常备军建设需要研究和解决的一个重要问题。近年来，在理论上出现了一些否定我军对内职能的观点。这次平息反革命暴乱，使大家对我军根本职能有了进一步认识。我军根本职能必须具有对外和对内两方面的内容。对外是抵御侵略、巩固国防、保卫国家安全和领土主权完整的钢铁长城；对内是反对颠覆、巩固政权、保卫社会主义制度和人民民主专政的坚强柱石。从历史上看，建国40年来我军对内执行过多次剿匪平叛的职能，都取得很好的效果：从现实看，反对西方“和平演变”战略，克服国家在改革中遇到的困难，保证安定团结的局面，也需要军队把对内职能作为根本职能，平息北京反革命暴乱，就进一步证明，我军对内职能不仅不能削弱，而且必须进一步加强，从国际上看，许多国家都把巩固政权作为军队的根本职能。我军的对内职能也是符合宪法要求的。
    由军事科学院主持的这次学术讨论会还探讨了常备军的建设、管理等问题。
