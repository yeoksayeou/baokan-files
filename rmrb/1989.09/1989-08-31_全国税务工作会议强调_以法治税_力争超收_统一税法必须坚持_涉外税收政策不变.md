Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th.

The national taxation work conference emphasized the need to push forward with the rule of law in taxation, to vigorously organize revenue collection, and to achieve the oversubscription target set by the State Council, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the overall situation.

Gold Xin, the director of the State Taxation Bureau, stated at the national taxation work conference held in Beijing today that all levels of taxation authorities must confidently promote the rule of law in taxation, vigorously organize revenue collection, and achieve the oversubscription target set by the State Council, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the overall situation.

Gold Xin analyzed the tax situation for the year, noting that from January to August, the national industrial and commercial tax revenue amounted to 11.81 billion yuan, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. Overall, the revenue situation looks promising. However, in the current context of tight funds, issues such as enterprises delaying tax payments and banks withholding tax revenues have not been adequately addressed. By the end of July, the total amount of tax arrears nationwide reached 9.8 billion yuan, with banks holding back 570 million yuan in taxes, and export tax refunds amounting to 8.87 billion yuan, with no signs of reduction in August. These factors have significantly impacted revenue collection.

Gold Xin pointed out that taxation is the main source of fiscal revenue in China. This year, the tax revenue organized by the taxation authorities is expected to increase by 3.4 billion yuan compared to last year. The completion of tax revenue directly affects the realization of the state budget and the stability of the national economy. Therefore, the State Council requires the taxation authorities to strictly implement tax policies, strengthen tax collection and administration, plug loopholes, and ensure that all collectible taxes are collected, striving for oversubscription.

Gold Xin stated that all regions should strengthen their overall perspective and adhere to the principle of unified tax law without any wavering or deviation. All local regulations that contradict national tax laws must be corrected. For reasonable tax exemptions and reductions, the necessary approval procedures must be followed according to tax management regulations before they can continue to be implemented. The various contract responsibility systems decided by the State Council must continue to be implemented, but taxation must be conducted in accordance with the law.

In another report, Gold Xin, the director of the State Taxation Bureau, reiterated on August 30th in Beijing that China's foreign-related tax policies remain unchanged. That is, the tax policy guidance that serves the open-door policy remains unchanged; the tax incentives for attracting foreign investment and introducing technology remain unchanged; the principle of light tax burden, wide incentives, and simplified procedures remains unchanged; and the requirements and measures to improve the investment environment remain unchanged. All local taxation authorities should, based on the above requirements, improve their foreign-related tax work.

    全国税务工作会议强调
    以法治税　力争超收
    统一税法必须坚持　涉外税收政策不变
    本报北京8月30日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：国家税务局局长金鑫今日在此间召开的全国税务工作会议上强调，各级税务机关要理直气壮地推进以法治税，大力组织收入，实现国务院提出的超收目标，为稳定大局多做贡献。
    金鑫在分析今年税收形势时指出，1至8月，全国工商税收完成1181亿元，比去年同期增长15％。总的看，收入形势看好。但在当前资金紧缺的情况下，企业拖欠税款、银行占压税款问题，未妥善解决，到7月底，全国企业欠税达98亿元，银行压税5.7亿元，出口退税已达88.7亿元，8月份仍有增无减。这些都给组织收入带来很大影响。
    金鑫指出，税收是我国财政收入的主要来源，今年税务机关负责组织的财政收入要比去年增加340亿元。税收完成情况直接影响国家预算的实现和国民经济大局的稳定。因此，国务院要求税务机关在正确执行税收政策的前提下，加强征管，堵塞漏洞，把应收的税款都收上来，力争超收。
    金鑫说，各地应加强全局观念，统一税法的原则必须始终如一地坚持，不能有任何动摇和变通。各地自定的有关规定，凡违反国家税法的，都必须予以纠正，对合理的减免税，必须按税收管理权限的规定办理报批手续后方可继续执行。国务院决定的各种包干、承包制度要继续执行，但必须依法征税。
    又讯　国家税务局局长金鑫30日在北京重申，我国涉外税收政策不变。即：服务于对外开放的税政指导思想不变；实施吸收外资、引进技术的税收优惠政策不变；坚持税负从轻、优惠从宽、手续从简的原则不变；为改善投资环境的要求和措施不变。各地税务机关要根据上述要求，把涉外税收工作做得更好。
