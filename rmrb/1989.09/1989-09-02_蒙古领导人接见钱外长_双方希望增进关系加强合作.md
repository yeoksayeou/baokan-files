Foreign Minister Qian said that Mongolia was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with China, and the two countries are neighbors. There are all reasons for the two peoples to strengthen friendship. In recent years, relations between the two countries have developed in all aspects, and we are satisfied with this.

Batmonkh said that we attach great importance to China's reform and opening-up. We have seen that China has achieved great success in building socialism in a short period of time. China's reform experience is not only China's experience but also has positive significance internationally. We value the reform experience of other socialist countries, especially China's experience.

Batmonkh said that we fully support China's independent foreign policy. We hope that China will achieve greater success and play a more important role in international affairs. Mongolia will also make its own efforts to safeguard world peace.
