Dear readers, you may already know that the nation's steel capital, coal capital, second-largest port, third-largest oil field, and the longest high-speed highway are all located in the heavy industry base of Liaoning.

However, you may not know that there is also the first power plant in New China with an installed capacity exceeding one million kilowatts, the Qinghe Power Plant; the Shenyang Smelting Plant, which produces one-third of the country's gold and one-tenth of its silver; the largest vertical shaft coal mine in Asia, the Caidi Mine; the Shenyang Transformer Factory, which provides the highest voltage levels, largest capacity, and highest quality power transmission and transformation equipment to the Gezhouba Dam, Northeast Power Grid, and East China Power Grid, surpassing Japanese standards; the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, which manufactures the most powerful diesel locomotives in China today, with contemporary international advanced technology; and the largest fighter jet manufacturing base in China, the Shenyang Aircraft Manufacturing Company.

You may also not know that China's first rocket, first fighter jet, first surface-to-air missile, first destroyer, and first nuclear submarine were all born here and took to the skies, sailed the seas, and hit their targets. The "7·18" oil and water replenishment ship built by Liaoning ended the history of the Chinese Navy's inability to sail far, providing important equipment for China's successful launch of long-range rockets into the Pacific Ocean. Liaoning made significant contributions to the successful development of China's first atomic bomb, first hydrogen bomb, and first synchronous satellite; the Scud missile that shocked the Gulf is also a product of Liaoning's large and medium-sized backbone enterprises.

If you come to the provincial capital of Shenyang, you will quickly discover that this is the cradle of China's machine tool industry and the base for manufacturing machine tools. Today, it has become the largest machine tool export city in the country, with its machine tools entering the markets of more than 30 countries and regions. The Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory, a key project built during the "First Five-Year Plan," has become the factory with the most machine tool exports in the industry nationwide. It produces 18 specifications of numerically controlled machine tools with world-advanced levels, with an annual export value of over $8 million. It is currently collaborating with PW Company, one of the top ten machine tool manufacturers in the United States, for transnational production.

If you come to the beautiful coastal city of Dalian, you must visit the Dalian Shipyard, which paves the way for the sea and builds a bridge for opening up. Despite the sluggish global shipbuilding market, this shipyard has been proactive in exploring and daring to innovate. Since 1980, it has signed contracts for the export of 640,000 tons of ships, including technologically advanced ro-ro ships, tankers, shuttle tankers, offshore drilling platforms, and large-scale repair drilling platforms. It is the only shipyard in China that can accept foreign orders for ships of 100,000 tons and above, with shipbuilding capacity accounting for one-quarter of the nation's total.

At the founding of the nation, people from all over the country cared for and supported the industrial development of Liaoning. Today, Liaoning's industry not only provides materials, equipment, talent, and experience for the country, but also contributes to the national economy through tax revenue. For example, large backbone enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Fushun Petrochemical Company, Liaoyang Petrochemical Fiber Company, Dalian Petrochemical Company, Jinzhou Petrochemical Company, Dalian Chemical Industry Company, Shenyang Golden Cup Automobile Company, Shenyang Cable Factory, and Liaohai Fertilizer Factory each generate annual tax revenues of over 2 billion, 1 billion, and 100 million yuan, respectively.

The rapid development of Liaoning's industry over the past 40 years, especially in the past 10 years, is mainly due to the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government's resolute implementation of the Party's relevant policies, guidelines, and principles, and the implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, and revitalizing large and medium-sized backbone enterprises. They have actively summarized and promoted the experiences of establishing smaller accounting units, implementing the factory director responsibility system, and the contract management responsibility system, and have carried out technological transformations in a planned and step-by-step manner, introducing advanced foreign technologies to make old enterprises continuously rejuvenate.

Over the past 40 years, the total industrial output value of Liaoning has increased by 99 times. This means that today's industrial output value of Liaoning is equivalent to 100 times that of the founding of the nation. The 25,000 industrial enterprises in the province, especially the 700 large and medium-sized backbone enterprises that are the pillars of the industry, have all undergone tremendous changes, showing vigorous vitality and becoming the backbone of the economic rise of the Liaodong Peninsula.

    从一到百
    ——奋进中的辽宁工业
    亲爱的读者，也许你已经知道，祖国的钢都、煤都、第二大港口、第三大油田、里程最长的高速公路，均座落在重工业基地——辽宁。
    但你可能不知道，这里还有新中国第一个装机容量超过百万千瓦的火力发电厂清河电厂；有黄金、白银产量分别占全国1／3、1／10的沈阳冶炼厂；有亚洲最大的竖井煤矿彩屯矿；有为葛洲坝、东北电网、华东电网提供电压等级最高、容量最大、质量优于日本的输变电设备的沈阳变压器厂；有制造具有当代国际先进水平、目前我国马力最大的内燃机车的大连机车车辆工厂；有我国最大的歼击机制造基地沈阳飞机制造公司。
    你可能还不知道，我国第一枚火箭弹、第一架歼击机、第一枚地空导弹、第一艘驱逐舰、第一艘核潜艇都在这里诞生，并从这个基地飞上蓝天、驰向大海和射向预定目标。辽宁建造的“7·18”油水补给船，结束了我国海军不能远航的历史，为我国成功地向太平洋海域发射远程火箭提供了重要装备。辽宁为我国第一颗原子弹、第一颗氢弹和第一颗同步卫星的研制成功作出了重大贡献；还有威震海湾的蚕式导弹，也是出自辽宁的大中型骨干企业。
    假如你来到省会沈阳，很快就会发现，这里是新中国机床工业的摇篮，制造工作母机的基地。而今，这里已成为共和国最大的机床出口城市，它的机床已打入30多个国家和地区的市场。“一·五”期间国家重点建设起来的沈阳第三机床厂，已成为全国同行业机床出口产品最多的厂家，生产具有世界先进水平的数控机床18种规格，年出口额达800多万美元，目前已与美国十大机床制造商之一的PW公司联合进行跨国生产。
    假如你来到美丽的海滨城市大连，一定要到为大海铺路、为开放搭桥的大连造船厂看看。这个厂在世界船舶市场不景气的情况下，积极开拓，勇于进取，自1980年以来已成交出口船舶64万吨，其中不仅有技术先进的滚装轮、油轮、穿梭油轮，还有海上钻井平台、恢复性大修钻井平台、海上石油生产膜块等巨型船舶。它是我国目前唯一能够接受国外10万吨级以上造船订货的厂家，造船能力占全国的1／4。
    建国之初，全国各地都关心、支援辽宁的工业建设。如今，辽宁工业不仅出材料、出设备、出人才、出经验，为全国服务，而且通过创利税，“出资金”，为祖国四化效力。例如鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司、抚顺石油化工公司、辽阳石油化纤公司、大连石油化工公司、锦州石油化工公司、大连化学工业公司、沈阳金杯汽车股份有限公司、沈阳电缆厂、辽河化肥厂等大型骨干企业，年创利税分别在20亿元、10亿元、1亿元以上。
    辽宁工业40年特别是近10年的蓬勃发展，主要是由于省委、省政府坚决贯彻执行党的有关路线、方针、政策，执行有关改革开放、搞活大中型骨干企业的方针，积极总结、推广划小核算单位、实行厂长负责制和承包经营责任制等一系列搞活大中型企业的经验，并有计划有步骤地实行技术改造，引进国外先进技术，使老企业不断焕发青春。
    40年来，辽宁工业总产值增长99倍。这就是说，如今一个辽宁的产值就相当于建国之初的100个辽宁。全省2.5万个工业企业，特别是作为工业支柱的700家大中型骨干企业，都发生了巨大的变化，展现出勃勃的生机和活力，成为辽东半岛经济崛起的脊梁。　（杨继柱）
