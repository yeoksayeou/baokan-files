There are two villages in Liu Li Ping Town of our city, Shuang Tang Village and Yu Jia Yuan Village. The two villages are separated by just one road, and their conditions are basically the same, but their economic development has taken on very different appearances.

Why has this situation come about? The fundamental reason lies in the role of the Party branch.

The Shuang Tang Village Party branch was re-elected in 1984. At that time, the per capita income of the entire village was only over 200 yuan per year. The Party branch faced difficulties head-on, organized the masses, and established three forest farms and nine village-run enterprises. The enterprise output value was over 1.2 million yuan, accounting for 72% of the village's total income. The entire village's per capita income from village-run enterprises was over 600 yuan.

In recent years, Shuang Tang Village has used collective savings to repair a reservoir, and to improve and build river dikes and canals. At the same time, more than 20 Party members in the village each helped a poor household. The village allocates over 5,000 yuan each year to help poor households purchase fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides. Currently, all 24 poor households in the village have removed their poverty caps.

After Shuang Tang Village became wealthy, the Party branch focused on education, building a village school building, and ensuring that all school-age children attend school for free. It was stipulated that young people who do not complete junior high school will not be arranged for employment. The village allocates over 4,000 yuan each year for technical training. In 1988, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee awarded the Shuang Tang Village Party branch the title of "Advanced Party Branch."

However, the Yu Jia Yuan Village Party branch is in stark contrast. Since 1984, the Party branch of this village has been adjusted three times, and the village Party branch secretary has changed one after another, but the work has not improved. The village cadres are either weak and dispersed or only look out for themselves. They have borrowed over 1 million yuan from the bank but have not accomplished anything, and the collective economy is still an empty shell.

### 两个村落，条件相同，面貌迥异，原因何在？　党支部的作用至关重要

　　两个村落，条件相同，面貌迥异，原因何在？
　　党支部的作用至关重要
    我市六里坪镇有一个双塘村，一个余家院村。两村仅一路之隔，条件基本相同，但经济发展的面貌却迥然不同。
    为什么会出现这种情况？根本原因在于党支部的作用。
    双塘村党支部是1984年改选的。当时，全村人均收入每年只有200多元。党支部知难而进，组织群众，先后办了3个林场，9个村办企业，企业产值120多万元，占全村总收入的72％，全村人均从村办企业中获纯收入600多元。
    几年来，双塘村利用集体积累，修复了一个水库，整治、修建了河堤和渠道等。同时，全村20多名党员每人帮助一户贫困户。村里每年拿出5000多元，帮助贫困户购买化肥、良种、农药等。目前，全村24户贫困户都已摘掉贫困帽子。
    双塘村富起来后，党支部花大力气，抓好教育，兴建了村教学楼，适龄儿童全部免费入学，规定青少年不读完初中，企业不安排就业。村里每年拿出4000多元，用于技术培训。1988年湖北省委授予双塘村党支部“先进党支部”的称号。
    但是，余家院村党支部却相形见绌了。1984年以来，这个村的党支部连续调整了3次，村党支部书记换了一茬又一茬，可是工作毫无起色。村干部不是软弱涣散，就是各自为自己打算。他们曾先后从银行贷款10多万元，却未办成一件事，集体经济至今仍是一张空壳。
