Beijing Lawfully Sentences Economic Criminals: Lenient and Severe Sentencing Reflects the Party's Consistent Policy

	People's Daily, Beijing, September 11th—The Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee and the municipal government held a meeting today to lawfully sentence severe economic criminals with leniency or severity.

	At today's sentencing meeting, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court sentenced the particularly severe and unrepentant embezzlers Shen Xiaoping, Li Yucai, and Wang Zilong, as well as the embezzlement, bribery, and speculation criminal Zhai Yi, to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment, respectively. For Wang Huaiying, who embezzled 24.97 million yuan and accepted 2.13 million yuan in bribes but voluntarily surrendered with all the illicit funds, the court decided to handle the case leniently and sentenced him to three years of fixed-term imprisonment with a five-year suspension, releasing him on the spot and handing him over to his unit.

	Additionally, Wu Kequang, the deputy director of Beijing Leather Goods Factory No. 3, was convicted of embezzlement, bribery, bribe-giving, and bigamy by the Beijing Higher People's Court. The Supreme People's Court has approved the death sentence. Wu Kequang was escorted to the execution ground today and shot.

	Shen Xiaoping's direct supervisor, Liu Chengding, the deputy director of the Materials Department of the Microelectronics Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was also sentenced to one year and six months of fixed-term imprisonment by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court for dereliction of duty. During his tenure, Liu Chengding did not verify 33 fake delivery tickets submitted by the purchasing officer Shen Xiaoping for reimbursement, blindly signing off on them, allowing Shen to easily embezzle 299,000 yuan of public funds, causing significant loss to state property.

	Today, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate announced the decision to handle leniently and not prosecute the embezzlers Li Huaiyuan and Zhang Yanxian, who voluntarily surrendered to the procuratorial organs and confessed, as well as the embezzlement and speculation criminal Liu Li. They were immediately handed over to their respective units.

	It is also known that the embezzler Jin Hengxi threatened Liu Li, an employee of Beijing Agricultural Construction and Environmental Beautification Company, four times after learning that Liu had confessed to the procuratorial organs, interfering with the case investigation. Jin Hengxi was arrested on charges of embezzlement by the Beijing Fengtai District Procuratorate on September 7th.

	Li Sixin, Secretary of the Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Confess and be lenient, resist and be severe," "punishment and leniency combined," is the consistent policy of our party and state towards those who have committed crimes, and is also the basic guiding ideology of the criminal law of the People's Republic of China. For all those who insist on being enemies of the people, who are unrepentant and continue to do evil, we must resolutely punish them severely according to the law; for all those who voluntarily surrender, confess thoroughly, and show signs of repentance, we must handle them leniently according to the law.

	Li Sixin said that punishing corruption and cracking down on economic crimes is one of the important tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Beijing must grasp this task tightly. Leaders of all departments and units must concentrate their efforts on promoting the spirit of the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate's notice, truly mobilize the masses, create the necessary momentum and pressure, make criminals fear the power of people's democratic dictatorship, voluntarily surrender, actively return the illicit funds, and expose and merit.

	Leaders at all levels must not cover up, conceal, or downplay economic criminal behavior in their own units or departments. They must not encourage or shelter such behavior. If leaders at all levels have problems, they should first confess and report them. The masses can also expose and report them.

　　北京依法判处经济犯罪分子
　　有宽有严体现党的一贯政策
    本报北京9月11日讯　中共北京市委、市政府今天召开大会，依法从宽或从严判处严重经济犯罪分子。
    在今天的宣判会上，北京市中级人民法院对罪行特别严重拒不悔罪的贪污犯沈晓平、李玉才、王子龙，贪污受贿投机倒把犯翟义分别判处死刑、无期徒刑、有期徒刑。对贪污24.97万元、受贿2.13万元的王怀颖，因其能够携带全部赃款主动投案自首，决定从宽处理，依法判处有期徒刑3年，缓刑5年，并当场释放，交由本单位领回。
    此外，北京皮件三厂副厂长武克强犯有贪污、受贿、行贿、重婚罪，经北京市高级人民法院终审判决，最高人民法院业已核准死刑。武克强今天被押赴刑场，执行枪决。
    大贪污犯沈晓平的直接领导、中国科学院微电子中心器材处副处长刘成鼎因玩忽职守，今天也被北京市中级人民法院判处有期徒刑1年零6个月。刘成鼎在任职期间对采购员沈晓平报销的33张假发货票，不审查核实，便盲目签字报销，致使沈轻易将29.9万余元公款贪污，给国家财产造成重大损失。
    北京市人民检察院分院今天在会上对向检察机关主动投案、自首坦白的贪污犯李淮芸、张燕仙，贪污投机倒把犯刘利宣布从宽处理、免予起诉的决定，并当场交其所在单位领回。
    另据了解，贪污犯金恒锡在得知本单位——北京农建环美公司业务员刘利向检察机关坦白自首后，先后4次威胁刘，干扰了案件侦破工作。经北京丰台区检察院批准于9月7日决定以贪污罪逮捕金恒锡。
    中共北京市委书记李锡铭在会上讲了话，他说，“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”，“惩办与宽大相结合”，这是我们党和国家对犯有罪行的人的一贯政策，也是中华人民共和国刑法立法的基本指导思想。对一切坚持与人民为敌，屡教不改，继续作恶的罪犯，必须坚决依法从严惩办；对一切投案自首，彻底坦白，有悔改表现的，必须依法宽大处理。
    李锡铭说，惩治腐败，打击经济犯罪，是党的十三届四中全会提出的重要任务之一，北京市一定要抓紧抓好。各部门、各单位领导必须集中精力宣传高法、高检《通告》的精神，真正把群众发动起来，造成必要的声势和压力，使犯罪分子慑于人民民主专政的威力，主动投案自首，积极退赃，并检举立功。各级领导对本单位、本部门出现的经济犯罪行为，不能护短，不能掩盖，不能大事化小，小事化了，更不能怂恿包庇。各级领导干部自己如果有问题，应当首先坦白交待，群众也可以揭发举报。
