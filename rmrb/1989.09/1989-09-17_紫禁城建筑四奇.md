The Forbidden City is the most complete existing group of ancient buildings in China, covering an area of over 720,000 square meters. Its architecture has four wonders:

The first wonder is that there are 9,999 and a half rooms. Why didn't the Forbidden City build exactly 10,000 rooms? It is said that only the Jade Emperor can enjoy exactly 10,000 rooms. As the Son of Heaven, the emperor absolutely cannot be on par with the Jade Emperor, so it had to be built with 9,999 and a half rooms.

The second wonder is the Three Rarities Hall. The Qianlong Emperor collected Wang Xizhi's "Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion," Wang Xianzhi's "Mid-Autumn Festival," and Wang Xun's "Letter to Boyuan" in just two small rooms covering an area of only eight square meters. Although the Three Rarities Hall is small, the wonder lies in its architectural design, which employs methods to influence visual perception. The entire room is paved with white-ground blue-flower tiles, and directly opposite is a large mural. The scenery in the painting is similar to the interior of the room, blending the inside and outside of the painting into one.

The third wonder is the solid rooms. There are four rows of such rooms in the Forbidden City. From the outside, they look like rooms, but inside, they are entirely made of stone pillars. This is actually a series of firewalls carefully designed by architects.

The fourth wonder is the stone carvings in front of the Hall of Divine Prowess. In front of the Hall of Divine Prowess in the imperial garden of the Forbidden City, the stone pillars are carved with sea monsters, turtles, shrimp, and crabs. It is said that the Hall of Divine Prowess once housed the True Warrior Emperor. During the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, the Hall of Divine Prowess caught fire, and it was only thanks to the True Warrior Emperor leading fish workers and snake craftsmen to extinguish the fire that the blaze was controlled.

　　紫禁城建筑四奇
    紫禁城是我国现存最完整的古建筑群，占地七十二万多平方米，其建筑有四奇：
      一奇是，房屋九千九百九十九间半。紫禁城为什么不建成一万间整数呢？据说，玉皇大帝才可以享用一万间整数，作为天子的皇帝，绝不能与玉皇大帝并驾齐驱，于是只好修建成九千九百九十九间半。
    二奇是，三希堂。乾隆皇帝把王羲之的《快雪时晴帖》、王献之的《中秋帖》、王询的《伯元远帖》收藏在仅有八平方米的两间房子里。三希堂虽小，奇的是在建筑上采取了影响视觉的方法。整座房子地面铺满白底蓝花瓷砖，靠里面又迎面设置了一幅大壁画，画中景物与室内相似，画里画外融为一体。
    三奇是，实心房。紫禁城内共有四排这样的房子，从外面看是房子，可里面全是砌成的石头墩子，这实际上是建筑家们精心设计的一道道防火墙。
    四奇是，钦安殿前的石刻。紫禁城内御花园里钦安殿前的颊杆石上，雕满了海妖水怪、鱼鳖、虾蟹等等。相传钦安殿里曾住过一位真武大帝，明嘉靖年间，钦安殿失火，多亏真武大帝及时率领鱼工蛇匠前来扑救，大火方被控制。（九月六日《中国广播报》史建勤摘）
