    The Huangdao Oil Depot's oil tanks exploded due to a lightning strike, resulting in the burning of 400,000 tons of crude oil. Public security firefighters bravely extinguished the fire, with dozens of casualties. The firefighters wrote a heroic song with their blood and lives.

    Premier Li Peng said that we must seriously summarize the experience and lessons, be practical and pragmatic, learn from one to apply to three, and use this accident as a negative example to improve safety production in oil areas.

    We must admit that the lessons from this disaster, the questions it raises, and the thoughts it provokes are profound and unforgettable. The selfless sacrifices and noble spirit of the people, police, and military in their struggle against the disaster will be remembered forever. At the same time, it is undeniable that the unsafe factors in the Huangdao Oil Depot's oil tanks were not discovered only after the accident. I remember that after the major forest fire in Da Xing'an Ling in 1987, the Ministry of Public Security, following the instructions of the State Council on strengthening safety production, sent an investigation team to the fire hazards in the Huangdao Oil Depot. They seriously proposed rectification suggestions and disclosed them in the news media. In theory, such a major issue related to the safety of people's lives and property should have been highly valued, and preventive measures should have been actively taken. However, some people did not heed the well-intentioned advice; instead, they complained about the reporters' inaccurate reporting, which damaged their "image." They continued to act as they pleased, ignoring the warnings. As a result, their bureaucratic style and gambling mentality were punished today.

    The ancients advocated "preventing problems before they arise" and promoted the idea of "prevention first"; today, some leaders of our units often nurture hidden dangers.

    The accident has passed, but the lessons are worth remembering. The author believes there are three insights: it is evidence in blood, demonstrating objective laws with bloody facts. Pursuing economic benefits should first serve safety; neglecting scientific monitoring and prevention of fires will eventually lead to disasters; it is a negative example, "remembering past events to teach future ones." Since we have paid such a high price, we should learn from the bloody lessons, further strengthen fire supervision and public opinion supervision, raise fire prevention awareness, and have fewer tragedies and more happy endings; it is an alarm clock, giving a loud warning to those bureaucrats who do not strictly implement fire regulations. Leaders should be in their positions and think of their duties, be vigilant in times of peace, and prevent disasters before they happen. If anyone is derelict of duty or commits a crime, they should be punished by law.

    举一反三

    黄岛油库油罐因雷击爆炸，四万吨原油焚烧殆尽。公安消防人员英勇灭火，伤亡数十人，灭火勇士用鲜血和生命谱写了一曲凯歌。
    李鹏总理说，要认真总结经验教训，要实事求是，举一反三，以这次事故作为改进油区安全生产的反面教材。
    应该承认，这场灾难所给予人们的教训，所提出的问题，所引起的思索，是深刻的，难忘的。民、警、军在向灾难抗争时所作出的无私牺牲以及崇高的精神永垂青史。同时，又无法否认，黄岛油库油罐存在的不安全因素，也并非事故发生后才发现。记得一九八七年大兴安岭特大森林火灾之后，公安部遵照国务院关于加强安全生产的指示精神，派出调查组对黄岛油库存在的火险隐患，曾严肃地提出过整改建议，并通过新闻媒介披露报端。按理说，这种关系保障人民生命财产安全的大事情，早应予以高度重视，积极采取防范措施。不料忠言“逆耳”，有人不予置理，倒埋怨记者的报道失实，损伤了他们的“形象”。依然我行我素，置若罔闻。结果呢，他们的官僚主义作风与侥幸心理，遭到了今天的惩罚。
    古人曾推崇“先其未然为上策”，倡导“防为上”的思想；而今我们有的单位的领导者却常常养痈成患。
    事故已经过去，教训值得记取。笔者以为启示有三：它是血证，用血的事实展示了客观规律。抓经济效益，首先应该服从于安全，忽视火灾的科学监测和预防工作，迟早会酿成灾祸；它是反面教材，“前事不忘，后事之师”，既然我们已经付出了这么昂贵的代价，就理应吸取血的教训，进一步加强消防监督和舆论监督，提高防火意识，尽量少点儿悲剧，多一些喜剧；它是警钟，它给那些不严格贯彻执行消防法规的官僚主义者以响亮的警策。领导者应该是在其位谋其政，居安思危，防患未然，如果谁渎职犯罪，谁就该受到法律的制裁。
