The First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, Rakowski, stressed on the 18th that the United Workers' Party must not only "fight against political enemies" but also "fight against the indifferent attitudes within the party in the new situation."

Rakowski expressed this view in his speech at the first stage of the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The Polish News Agency broadcast his full speech tonight.

Rakowski said that after the June parliamentary elections and the failure to form a government in August, the situation in Poland has changed in favor of the opposition. All party members should draw lessons from this and not be pessimistic or lose confidence about the future. He pointed out that during the parliamentary elections, millions of voters voted for the candidates of the United Workers' Party, which shows that they still trust the Polish United Workers' Party and "have hopes for the United Workers' Party."

This Polish party leader said that the biggest danger currently facing the party is its split, because it "threatens the party not only in theory but also in practice." He emphasized that splitting the United Workers' Party into several parties "will only weaken the left," rather than strengthen the left's power. He called on the entire party to unite and fight together in the current situation, making the party truly a united and fighting party.

Rakowski said that the United Workers' Party takes an "active attitude" towards the new government, but "reserves the right to make constructive criticisms." He pointed out that the United Workers' Party is satisfied with the new government's respect for Poland's international commitments and the alliance relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union. However, he criticized some opposition figures in the new government for advocating the theory of the merger of the two Germanys, believing that this arbitrary change in foreign policy will bring "disaster" to Poland.

    波党第一书记在党中央全会发言指出
    要同党内无所作为的思想作斗争
    新华社华沙9月19日电　波兰统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基18日强调说，统一工人党今后不仅要“同政治敌人进行斗争”，而且要“同党内在新形势下出现的无所作为思想作斗争”。
    拉科夫斯基是昨天在统一工人党15中全会第一阶段会议上讲话时阐述这一看法的。波通社今晚播发了他的讲话全文。
    拉科夫斯基说，统一工人党在6月议会大选和8月组阁失败后，波兰国内形势发生了有利于反对派的变化。全体党员应从中吸取教训，而不应对前途消极悲观，失去信心。他指出，在议会大选时数百万选民投票赞成统一工人党候选人，这说明他们仍对波兰统一工人党表示信任，并“寄希望于统一工人党。”
    这位波党领导人说，党的分裂是目前面临的最大危险，因为它“不仅在理论上，而且在事实上威胁着党”。他强调指出，把统一工人党分裂成几个党“只会削弱左派”，而不会增强左派的力量。他要求全党在当前形势下团结一致，共同战斗，使党真正成为团结的、战斗的党。
    拉科夫斯基说，统一工人党对新政府“采取积极的态度”，但“保留对它进行建设性批评的权利”。他指出，统一工人党对新政府尊重波兰国家承诺的国际义务和波苏两国同盟关系表示满意，但对新政府中某些反对派人士鼓吹两个德国合并理论提出了批评，认为外交政策上的这一任意篡改，将会给波兰“带来灾难”。
