Who is it that first greets the sunrise in the morning?
Who is it that makes the streets and alleys so clean and tidy?
It is they, it is they—the city's "beauticians," the unsung heroes of sanitation.

However, when people face the beauty of the city, when they read their letters and listen to their heartfelt words, everyone will find: society knows too little about them, too little...

Doing the Hardest Jobs

Sweeping the streets seems like something anyone can do, but how do our sanitation workers do it?

At 4 AM, when most people are in their deepest sleep, sanitation workers begin their cleaning duties. In winter, they can't wear too many clothes, because if they do, they'll sweat profusely while working, and there's nowhere to put their clothes when they take them off. In summer, they sweat like rain, and the flying dust keeps hitting them. After a few hours, their faces are covered in dust. They work outdoors all year round, and the eaves of buildings and some units' guard rooms are their shelters from wind and rain. "In winter, they hide by the walls; in summer, they seek shade under trees." Walls and tree shades are their resting places. Each person sweeps over 8,000 square meters of road every day, and the trash cans by the road also need to be cleaned and scrubbed daily. The spit stains on the trash cans can't be scrubbed off, so they scrape them off with their hands.

The Longning District Environmental Sanitation Office's Chang'an West Road Cleaning Team, which has been awarded the title of Shanghai Municipal Labor Model for five consecutive terms, has summarized the "four sweeping methods": sweeping back and forth at stations, lightly sweeping around puddles, sweeping repeatedly after rain, and pressing down dust while sweeping in the wind. These methods not only comply with operational standards but also reflect their professional ethics. Recently, they have also summarized the experience of "sweeping sunny areas first in winter and shady areas first in summer." This is because in winter, people prefer to walk in sunny areas, while in the heat of summer, they prefer shady places.

To facilitate people's lives, sanitation workers must remove urban garbage and clean toilets. Beijing produces an average of 8,700 tons of garbage per day, and if it is not processed in time, it will ferment and stink. The stench is overwhelming, and swarms of flies buzz around wildly. To maintain the cleanliness of the city's 6,800 toilets, they have to pay a lot of labor costs. Some toilets need to be cleaned with sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid reacts with urine, producing a large amount of irritating gas that often makes the cleaning workers' eyes water and noses bleed. Sewer workers often have to deal with the stench of methane gas that makes it hard to breathe. Sometimes, the sewage truck can't suck out all the stinky sewage, so the workers have to go down into the sewage pit and shovel it out with a shovel, then load it into a bucket and carry it out.

Shanghai's garbage collectors have the most strenuous job in sanitation work. Land-based garbage collectors work from dusk till dawn the next day, clearing and transporting nearly 10,000 tons of household garbage and nearly 7,000 tons of sewage to the garbage wharf, where they are then transported by thousands of ships to the suburbs and rural areas. They are always seen in the streets and alleys, digging through garbage, cleaning garbage cans, shoveling garbage onto the truck, and taking it away. They are soaked in sweat and smell of garbage, and after a shift, they are so tired that they can barely move, sometimes their hands and feet go numb. The workers on the water transport ships are even more miserable. They work and live on the filthy garbage transport ships. The garbage and sewage loaded on the cement and iron barges, after being exposed to the sun and fermented, have an even more pungent smell, penetrating into the five viscera, causing headaches and nausea. According to statistics, just in a six-square-meter cabin, 0.9 kilograms of flies are killed by pesticides. The workers eat and sleep in the extremely crude garbage transport ships. During the nearly three months of garbage peak, they almost work 24 hours a day without stopping.

Today's "Shi Chuanxiang"

The reporter conducted on-site interviews in Beijing and Qinhuangdao and received letters from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, from which we saw and heard many moving stories of sanitation workers.

In Beijing's Chongwen District, Yangjia Garden North Alley, the reporter witnessed an old sewer worker's work scene: four small, low, and dilapidated toilets, with walls as high as the neck covered with asbestos tiles, making it impossible to stand straight. He used a shovel to scoop up the feces and urine, pouring it into a bucket, then carrying it out of the alley and pouring it into the large bucket on the sewage truck. This old sewer worker is named Ren Huating (see the picture in the text), and he is 57 years old this year. He has been carrying sewage for over 30 years and is an old comrade of Shi Chuanxiang. One of his leaders told the reporter: "He has never married, lives in a collective dormitory at the unit. His belongings are just an old box, inside which are many kinds of medals and certificates. He donates money to the Red Cross every year, totaling 1,340 yuan, and was awarded the honorary title of Red Cross member. He also donated 600 yuan to support disaster areas and repair the Great Wall." He is a Shi Chuanxiang-like figure.

In fact, today's Shi Chuanxiang is not just Ren Huating. There are also He Xiuming, the sewer worker from Beijing's Xicheng District, Song Chunlan, the street cleaner, and Xue Rongxiu, the street cleaner from Chongwen District. Beijing has its Shi Chuanxiang, and other places also have their Shi Chuanxiang. Like Xu An from Qinhuangdao's Shanhaiguan District, Du Yaozhong from the Port District, and Li Haixia from Beidaihe District; Tan Xiuzhi from Guangzhou's Yuexiu District, Ye Xiufang from Dongshan District; Wang Hongfu from Shanghai's Huangpu District, and Zhao Cuirong from the Water Transport Company, etc., they are all advanced figures like Shi Chuanxiang. They beautify the city with their hard work and beautify the world with their beautiful hearts.

Hardships Need Understanding

"We are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of dirt, but we are afraid of not being understood." During the interviews, the most common plea from sanitation workers was this sentence. A female worker said: "Some people discriminate against us, do not respect our labor. You clean in front, and they mess up behind you. If you say something, they will curse at you." The head of Beijing's Xicheng District Sanitation Team Five, Ou Yang Boyan, said: "Some people cover their noses and run when they see the sewage truck enter the alley, with faces full of contempt. If our workers make a slight mistake and splash a little sewage on them, they will be cursed or beaten, and the relevant authorities do not take effective measures, resulting in frequent beatings."

According to the reporter's multi-faceted understanding, the working conditions and living conditions of sanitation workers are relatively poor. In some places, the wages of sanitation workers are low, and it is difficult for workers to find housing, get married, and for their children to find jobs. On the other hand, modern people's requirements for environmental hygiene are getting higher and higher, and in large cities and tourist cities, it is even more necessary to maintain environmental hygiene. Under these circumstances, those sanitation workers "are willing to be dirty for the sake of others' cleanliness," silently dedicating their hard work, and doing their best to beautify our cities. Thinking of this, can't we understand them more?

    装点江山
    本报记者 王玲  崔悦温
    上海市容建设报  徐友良
    是谁，在晨曦中最先迎来了阳光？
    是谁，把大街小巷梳妆得那样整洁？
    是他们，是她们——城市“美容师”，默默无闻的环卫工人。
    然而，当人们面对那美的城市，读读他们的来信，听听那肺腑之言，谁都会发现：社会对他们了解得太少了，太少了……
          做难做的事
    扫马路，似乎谁都会干，可我们的环卫工人是怎么干的呢？
    凌晨4时该是人们睡得最香的时候，而环卫工人们开始清扫地段。冬天他们不能多穿衣服，因为衣服穿多了，干起活来就会汗流浃背，脱下来又没处搁。夏天挥汗如雨，飞扬的尘土不断扑来，几小时下来就灰尘满面。他们一年四季都是露天作业，街道旁的屋檐和一些单位的传达室便是他们避风躲雨的地方。“冬天溜墙根，夏天找树荫”，墙根和树荫就是他们的休息场所。他们每人每天要清扫马路8000多平方米，路旁的垃圾箱也要天天清理刷洗。垃圾箱上的斑斑痰迹凝在上面，刷不掉他们就用手抠。
    连续五届被评为上海市劳模集体的长宁区环卫所延安西路清道小组，总结出“遇到车站来回扫，碰上水塘轻轻扫，下雨停后反复扫，刮风灰大压住扫”的“四扫法”，既符合操作规范，又体现了他们的职业道德。不久前，他们又在实践中总结出“冬天先扫阳光处，夏天先扫阴凉处”的经验。因为冬天行人喜欢走有阳光的地方，大热天则喜欢走阴凉之处。
    为了方便人们的生活，环卫工人必须清除城市垃圾，打扫厕所。北京市平均日产垃圾8700吨，处理稍不及时就会发酵变臭。恶臭扑鼻，成群的苍蝇狂飞乱舞。为了保持全市6800座厕所的清洁，他们要付出很多劳动代价。有的厕所需用硫酸清洗，硫酸遇尿挥发而产生的大量刺激性气体，常使保洁工眼睛流泪、鼻腔出血。掏粪工往往还要对付熏得人难以喘气的沼气。有时用粪车抽不净臭粪，掏粪工就下到粪井里用铁锹挖，然后装入粪桶背上来。
    上海的清运工是环卫工作中最繁重的工作。陆上清运工每天黄昏至第二天清晨，要将全市近万吨生活垃圾和近7000吨粪便清理、运送到垃圾专用码头，再由水上运输公司的千艘船只运往市郊和农村。他们天天出没于大街小巷，钻垃圾间，清垃圾箱，一锹锹装上车，运出去。他们流一身臭汗、沾一身臭气，一个班次下来，累得爬也爬不起来，有时手脚完全麻木。水上运输职工就更苦了。他们每天工作、生活在龌龊的垃圾运输船上。装在水泥船、铁驳船上的垃圾、粪便，经暴晒发酵，其恶臭更为刺鼻，钻入五脏六腑，使人头痛，令人作呕。据统计，仅在六平方米船舱里药死的苍蝇，竟有0.9公斤之多。职工们食宿均在极其简陋的垃圾运输船上。在垃圾高峰的近三个月中，他们几乎每天都要24小时不停地装运。
        今日“时传祥”
    记者在北京和秦皇岛实地采访，也收到来自上海、广州等地的信件，从中看到、听到不少环卫工人的动人事迹。
    在北京崇文区杨家园北里，记者目睹了一位老掏粪工的作业现场：四座厕所狭小、低矮、破旧，齐脖高的墙上盖着石棉瓦，根本直不起腰来。他用粪勺一勺勺舀起粪尿，倒入粪桶，然后背出小巷，倒入粪车上的大桶。这位老掏粪工名叫任华亭（见文中图），今年已57岁了，是时传祥的老战友，背粪已30多年了。他的一位领导告诉记者：“他没成过家，住在单位的集体宿舍。他的家当只是一口破旧的箱子，里面装了许多各种各样的奖章和奖状。他年年向红十字会捐款，总计1340元，被红十字会授予荣誉会员称号。他还为支援灾区、修复长城捐款600元。”他是时传祥式的人物。
    其实，今天的时传祥也不止一个任华亭，像北京市西城区的掏粪工何绪明、干路工宋春兰、崇文区的干路工薛荣修都是。北京有时传祥，外地也有时传祥。像秦皇岛市山海关区的徐安、海港区的杜耀忠、北戴河区的李海霞；广州市越秀区的谭秀织、东山区的叶秀芳；上海市黄浦区的王洪福、水运公司的赵翠英等等，都是时传祥式的先进人物。他们以艰辛劳动美化着城市，以美好心灵美化着人间。
          艰辛需理解
    “我们不怕苦，不怕脏，就是怕不理解。”在采访过程中，我们听到环卫工人最多的呼声就是这句话。一位女工说：“一些人歧视我们，不尊重我们的劳动，你在前面清扫，他在后面糟踏，你若说一句，他就破口大骂。”北京市西城区环卫五队队长欧阳伯年说：“有些人一见抽粪车进胡同就捂着鼻子跑，满脸的鄙夷不屑。如果我们的工人稍有差错，粪水溅到他们身上一点点，就会遭到辱骂或殴打，而有关方面也查处不力，致使打人现象屡有发生。”
    据记者多方面了解，环卫工人的工作条件和生活待遇都比较差。有些地方环卫工人工资偏低，职工住房难、娶妻难、子女就业难。而另一方面，现代人对环境卫生的要求愈来愈高，在大城市和旅游城市更需要保持环境的卫生清洁。在这种情况下，那些环卫工人“宁可一人脏，换来大家净”，默默地奉献着艰苦的劳动，尽可能地美化着我们的城市。想想这些，我们难道不能对他们多一些理解吗？
