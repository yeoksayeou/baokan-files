		Ten years of reform have transformed Yuxi Cigarette Factory from a medium-sized enterprise into the largest cigarette manufacturer in the country. In 1987, the factory ranked 24th among the top 100 industrial enterprises in China, first in the national light industry and pharmaceutical sector, and was also the top performer in terms of economic benefits among the top 100 enterprises in China.

		Yuxi Cigarette Factory was established in 1956. Ten years ago, its annual production capacity was only 307,000 boxes. Under the guidance of the reform and opening-up policy of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Chen Shijin, the factory director and recipient of the national May 1st Labor Medal, led the entire workforce in a relentless struggle for improvement. Since 1981, the enterprise has invested more than $50 million, importing 85 sets of various equipment from Britain, Italy, West Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands, including two cigarette-making production lines. The factory has also modified and innovated the imported equipment, propelling its cigarette production technology and equipment to the forefront of the nation.

		In 1988, the factory produced 1,077,000 boxes of cigarettes, leading the industry nationwide, with an industrial output value of 980 million yuan and a tax and profit of 1.19 billion yuan, achieving a per capita tax and profit of 270,000 yuan. Key economic and technical indicators such as consumption and profit are at the forefront of the nation. The factory can now produce 13 brands of cigarettes in various specifications, making it the largest cigarette enterprise in the country with the most famous and high-quality products. Among them, the "Hongta Mountain" brand cigarette has been awarded the national quality product and won the silver medal; "A Shima," "Congratulations on the New Year," "Red Plum Blossom," and "New Prosperity" brand cigarettes have been evaluated as national tobacco industry quality products. Newly developed brands such as "Ziyun" and "New Prosperity" have entered the Japanese and Southeast Asian markets.

    云烟之乡的明星企业

    玉溪卷烟厂始建于1956年。10年前，这个厂年产能力仅有30.7万箱。在党的十一届三中全会改革开放方针的指引下，全国“五一”劳动奖章获得者、厂长褚时健带领全厂职工开始打一场艰苦奋斗的翻身仗。从1981年以来，企业投资5000多万美元，先后从英国、意大利、联邦德国、日本和荷兰等国引进各种设备85台（套），制丝生产线两条，并对引进设备进行改造和创新，使卷烟生产技术装备一跃进入全国先进行列。
    1988年，全厂生产卷烟107.7万箱，居全国同行业之首，完成工业产值9.8亿元，实现税利11.9亿元，人均创税利27万元。消耗、利润等主要经济技术指标居全国先进水平。现在这个厂已能生产13个牌号多种规格的卷烟，成为全国名优产品最多的大型卷烟企业，其中“红塔山”牌卷烟被评为国家优质产品，荣获银质奖；“阿诗玛”、“恭贺新禧”、嘴“红梅”、“新兴”等牌子卷烟，被评为全国烟草行业优质产品。新开发的“紫云”、“新兴”等牌卷烟已打入日本、东南亚地区。　（杜敏生）
