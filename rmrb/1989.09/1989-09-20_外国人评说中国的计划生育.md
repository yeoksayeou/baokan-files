At the 1984 International Population Conference held in Mexico City, Rafael Salas, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, stated in the "Report on the Review and Evaluation of the World Population Action Plan": "Between 1970-1975 and 1980-1985, the global population growth rate decreased from 20 per thousand to 17 per thousand. Among developing countries, China's reduction in population growth rate is of the greatest significance (during this period, the growth rate decreased from 24 per thousand to 12 per thousand)." In the same year, Salas mentioned in another speech: "China has provided an excellent example to the world by integrating population programs with national development goals."

The Worldwatch Institute's honorary chairman and renowned environmental and population expert, Lester Brown, wrote in the 1984 "State of the World Report": "The developing country that has achieved the most remarkable success in family planning is probably China. By 1980, China had reduced its crude birth rate to 20 per thousand. It is almost unimaginable for a large country still in the early stages of economic development to achieve such success. The initiation of the 'one child per family' policy was not because Chinese leaders fully endorsed the concept itself, but because the pressure from population growth left them with no other choice. This unprecedented policy has put China at the forefront of efforts to control population growth in the Third World."

On April 11, 1985, Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq said: "China has achieved remarkable results in the field of family planning. In this regard, Pakistan needs the help of Chinese friends."

In September 1986, Professor Maher Mahran, Secretary-General of the Egyptian Population Commission, led a delegation to visit China and said: "China has achieved world-renowned success in family planning, which we call a miracle of the modern world. This sets an example and provides valuable experience for many Third World countries to solve their urgent population problems. Third World countries will ultimately have to follow China's path and learn from China's experience to address the serious population problems that threaten us and the entire world."

At the conference commemorating "World Population Day" in China, the representative of the United Nations Population Fund in China, Kong Lei, said: "China's family planning work is the most successful in the world today, which has been internationally recognized. In fact, the achievement of reducing the population growth rate globally is mainly due to China's family planning work."

　　外国人评说中国的计划生育
　　杜祥金
    △一九八四年在墨西哥城召开的国际人口会议上，联合国人口基金执行主任拉裴尔·萨拉斯在《关于审查和评价世界人口行动计划的报告》中指出：“在一九七○—一九七五年至一九八○—一九八五年间，全世界人口年增长率已由千分之二十降到千分之十七……在发展中国家里，中国的人口增长率下降具有最重大的意义（这十年间增长率从千分之二十四下降到千分之十二）。”同年，萨拉斯在另一次谈话中又说：“中国在把人口方案与国家发展目标相结合方面，为世界提供了出色的榜样。”
    △世界观察学会名誉会长、著名环境和人口问题专家布朗在一九八四年《纵观世界全局报告集》中写道：“发展中国家在计划生育方面取得最令人难忘的成就的，大概是中国了……到一九八○年中国把原始出生率降至千分之二十，这样一个仍然处于经济发展初级阶段的大国，能够取得如此成就简直令人难以想象。”“发起一家生一个孩子的运动并非因为中国领导人完全赞同这个概念本身，而是因为人口造成的压力已使他们别无其它选择……这项前所未有的政策的提出，使中国在努力控制人口增长方面走在第三世界其它国家的前面。”
    △一九八五年四月十一日，巴基斯坦总统齐亚·哈克说：
  “中国在计划生育领域取得了显著成就。在这方面，巴基斯坦需要中国朋友的帮助。”
    △一九八六年九月，埃及人口委员会秘书长马希尔·马赫兰教授率团访华时说：“中国在计划生育方面取得了举世瞩目的成就，我们称之为当今世界的奇迹。这为广大第三世界国家解决紧迫的人口问题树立了榜样，提供了有益的经验。第三世界国家终究要走中国的道路，借鉴中国的经验来解决威胁我们乃至整个世界的严重人口问题。”
    △联合国人口活动基金驻华代表孔雷飒在中国纪念“世界五十亿人口日”大会上说：“中国的计划生育工作是当今世界上最成功的，这已得到国际公认。事实上，目前世界范围内所取得的人口增长率的下降成就，主要应归功于中国的计划生育工作。”
