On the morning of May 18, 1980, a flash of white light streaked across the sky over the South Pacific, plunging into the sea and sending up a massive column of water, accompanied by a thunderous roar. The world was shaken, and Americans exclaimed: "This is four years ahead of schedule!"

This was China's first long-range missile launch and recovery test. The fleet of oceanic target measurement ships that participated in the sea-based measurement and recovery of the data capsule was a source of pride for the Chinese Navy and Chinese shipbuilders. The "Far Horizon" series was the core of this fleet.

Humanity has entered the space age, making every country seem smaller. No country's territory can meet the needs of full-range testing of long-range missiles and satellites. Therefore, in addition to building tracking and measurement stations on their own territory, countries must also establish mobile observation stations in the vast open seas. These are space tracking ships. Such ships are rare worldwide, and China has two—the Far Horizon 1 and Far Horizon 2.

China is one of the four countries in the world that possess space tracking ships.

The "Far Horizon" series is known as the "floating scientific city," equivalent to shrinking a land-based measurement station that spans dozens of miles into a ship that is over 100 meters long. It has a 16,000-horsepower steam turbine, equivalent to the power generation equipment for a city of 300,000 people, equivalent to the refrigeration equipment of a first-class hotel, with 427 cabins, and various precise navigation equipment, measurement equipment, and advanced communication methods. The ship is filled with antennas, totaling 54 sets of various sizes. Building such a multifunctional comprehensive complex ship, foreign countries first used old ships to convert them into single-function measurement ships, accumulating experience before building multifunctional comprehensive ships. We, however, started from scratch, from nothing to something, and succeeded in one go. Therefore, when mentioning "Far Horizon," shipbuilders will say, "That is our pride." Even colleagues from developed countries often mention this ship to us and give us thumbs up.

In addition to the "Far Horizon" series, the "Xiangyanghong 10" oceanic survey ship and the oceanic salvage and rescue ship in the fleet are also ships with numerous equipment, complex systems, and advanced performance. In 1984, they carried members of China's expedition team to the South Pole, establishing the "Changcheng" research station on the Antarctic continent for the first time. The oceanic oil and water replenishment ship is a symbol of ocean-going capability.

Over the past 40 years, the shipbuilding industry has provided the Navy with more than 6,000 ships totaling over 100 million tons, ending nearly a century of military ship imports. The Chinese Navy has gone from nothing to possessing various types of combat vessels, such as gunboats, patrol boats, torpedo fast attack craft, missile fast attack craft, landing craft, minesweepers, missile frigates, missile destroyers, conventional submarines, conventional missile submarines, nuclear torpedo submarines, and nuclear missile submarines. China ranks third in the world in the number of conventional submarines. China is also the fifth country, after the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, to independently develop nuclear submarines. The Chinese Navy now has the capability for long-range navigation and is developing towards missile, electronic, and automated systems.

The 40-year history of military shipbuilding not only strengthens national defense but also exports overseas. In 1984, a missile frigate exported to Egypt withstood a 12-level typhoon at sea. Upon arrival in Egypt, the defense minister's first words were: "How is the ship?" The captain replied three times: "Good ship! Good ship! Good ship!"

Let us quote a famous saying by Engels: "Modern warships are not only products of modern large-scale industry but also a microcosm of modern large-scale industry."

In April 1987, the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard signed a contract with the German company Harms & Laeisz to build a 27,000 TEU container ship. This is not an ordinary ship; it incorporates the latest ship design research results from more than 30 famous German universities and research institutes and is known as the "ship of the future in the 1990s." This event caused a sensation in the international shipbuilding industry. A maritime authority commented: "If this ship can be built, it can be said without exaggeration that there is no ship that the Hudong Shipyard cannot build!"

Two years later, when the ship, named "Berlin Express," slid into the water amid cheers, it was undoubtedly another glorious moment for China's shipbuilding industry.

Looking back, China's shipbuilding industry was "forced into the fray."

Historically, China's shipbuilding industry also had its glory days. In the Ming Dynasty, Admiral Zheng He led a fleet of over 27,000 people on seven voyages to the Western Seas, proving the achievements of the shipbuilding industry at that time.

However, by the Qing Dynasty, China's shipbuilding industry declined day by day. By the eve of liberation, there were only about 20 steel shipyards left in the country, struggling in the midst of years of war and turmoil. The once mighty China had foreign ships running along its coasts and rivers.

In 1949, New China was born, and the shipbuilding industry was reborn. Over the past 40 years, the shipbuilding industry has overcome numerous difficulties and achieved remarkable results. There are now more than 500 shipyards, and the total shipbuilding capacity has reached 20.9 million tons. Forty years ago, the ship equipment manufacturing sector in China was largely a blank, and specialized research and design institutions were completely non-existent. Today, there are more than 80 research and design institutes nationwide, and a complete shipbuilding industrial system has been established.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the shipbuilding industry has developed rapidly in the past decade. During this period, the Sixth Machinery Industry Bureau (later renamed the China State Shipbuilding Corporation) underwent economic adjustments, reduced military products, and suddenly faced the problem of feeding 300,000 shipbuilders.

What to do? Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform, said to the leaders of the Sixth Machinery Industry Bureau at the time: "China's shipbuilding industry must enter the international market."

However, China's shipbuilding industry had been isolated from the world for too long, and the outside world knew nothing about it. At this time, Pack Keung, the brother of shipping magnate Pack Tai-kwok, expressed his willingness to build ships in China instead of Japan. Pack Tai-kwok also announced that he would invest $100 million in China to build ships. This move delighted Chinese shipbuilders and seemed to be a call to action. Subsequently, China signed a series of contracts with shipowners from other countries.

Building export ships to international standards was the first step towards the international market. The enormous pressure unleashed enormous potential. From negotiations to signing contracts, from design to manufacturing, every link was highly tense. The designers at the 708 Research Institute worked day and night, with working hours exceeding 10 hours a day, even reaching 16 hours. The Dalian Shipyard also showed the spirit of "steamed buns with pickled vegetables to build ships." The entire Sixth Machinery Industry Bureau, from top to bottom, opened the green light for the construction of the "Long City" ship...

When the "Long City" was delivered on time, Pack Keung praised it as "world-class."

The success of the "Long City" won China's shipbuilding industry a reputation in the international market. As the chairman of the British Lloyd's Register said at the time: "The Long City has opened a new era for China's shipbuilding." From 1978 to 1988, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation cumulatively contracted 250 million tons of civilian export ships, plus other export products, with a total transaction amount of over $2.2 billion. The contracted export ship tonnage developed from the ten-thousand-ton level to the hundred-thousand-ton level; the variety developed from general cargo ships to container ships, three-use working ships, and roll-on/roll-off ships, refrigerated ships, and large refrigerated container ships; the regions developed from Hong Kong to 20-plus countries and regions in the five continents.

History has proven the correctness of China's shipbuilding industry's choice: from 1973 to 1987, the world's shipbuilding industry experienced the most severe recession in history, with a small recovery from 1979 to 1981. In 1980, the central foreign trade system underwent major reforms, and the Sixth Machinery Industry Bureau obtained the crucial foreign trade rights, realizing the integration of industry and trade, allowing China's shipbuilding industry to enter the international market at this critical moment and rise in the international market with our superior quality and low prices.

Through ship exports, China's shipbuilding industry has achieved a leap in technological level, completing in 10 years what would have taken 20 years, with products jumping from the 1960s level to the 1980s level. We have mastered international standards and improved our design level. We have introduced 48 foreign advanced ship equipment manufacturing technologies and achieved a 70% domestic production capability for export ships. We have also introduced a batch of advanced equipment, renovated a batch of shipyards, and improved management levels.

Ten years, how much hardship, how much confusion, how many moments of joy.

The moment ends the past of backwardness, but can we open the door to a powerful future? This is a new question before us.

    四十年光辉的瞬间
    ——记新中国的造船业本报记者　朱剑红
    1980年5月18日上午，南太平洋海域的天空中，一团白光掠空而过，随即溅落于海面，激起巨大的白色水柱，传出雷鸣般的轰响。全世界为之震动，美国人惊呼：此举比预料的时间提早了4年！
    这是我国首次远程运载火箭发射试验，试验中那支担任海上测量和打捞数据舱的远洋靶场测量船队，是中国海军、中国造船人的骄傲。“远望号”，是这支舰队的核心船只。
    人类进入了航天时代，每个国家都变“小”了。地球上的任何一国领土，都满足不了远程导弹与卫星全程试验的需要。因此，除在本国领土建造跟踪测量站外，还得在辽阔的公海上建立流动观测站，这就是航天测量船。这种船全世界也是屈指可数，中国就有两只——远望一号和远望二号。
    中国是世界上4个拥有航天测量船的国家之一。
      “远望号”，人称“海上科学城”，等于把陆上几十里长的测量站缩小到100多米长的船上。它有16000马力的汽轮机组，相当于30万人口城市居民用电的发电设备，相当于一流大饭店的制冷设备，427套房间，还有各种精密的导航设备、测量设备和先进的通信手段，船上天线林立，大小有54套。建造这样多功能综合性的复杂船舶，国外是先用旧船改装成单一功能的测量船，积累经验后，再建造多功能的综合性船。而我们则是在一张白纸上起步，从无到有，一举成功。所以，一提起
  “远望”，造船人都会说：“那是咱们的骄傲。”就连发达国家的同行们，也常常在我们面前主动提起这船，竖起大拇指。
    除了“远望号”，船队中的“向阳红10号”远洋调查船和远洋打捞救生船，也是设备众多、系统复杂、性能先进的船只。1984年，它们曾载我国探险考察队员远征南极，首次在南极大陆建起“长城”考察站。远洋油水补给船，是远洋航行能力的标志。
    40年来，造船工业为海军提供了6000余艘舰船，100多万吨，结束了近百年军舰进口历史。中国海军从无到有，拥有各种战斗舰艇，如：炮艇、护卫艇、鱼雷快艇、导弹快艇、登陆舰艇、扫雷舰艇、导弹护卫舰、导弹驱逐舰、常规鱼雷潜艇、常规导弹潜艇、鱼雷核潜艇和导弹核潜艇。中国拥有的常规潜艇数量居世界第三位。中国，还是继美、苏、英、法之后，第五个能自行研制核潜艇的国家。中国海军已具备了远洋航行能力，并向着导弹化、电子化、自动化发展。
    40年制造的军舰不仅壮军威壮国威，还向外出口。1984年，一艘出口埃及的导弹护卫舰在海上经历了12级台风的考验。船到埃及，国防部长迎上来的第一句话是：“船怎么样？”舰长连说三声：“好舰！好舰！好舰！”
    让我们引用恩格斯的一句名言：“现代的军舰不仅是现代大工业的产物，而且同时还是现代大工业的缩影。”
    1987年4月，上海沪东造船厂与西德哈·劳公司签订了一条2700箱集装箱船的建造合同。这不是一条普通的船，它集中了西德30多家著名大学、研究所的最新船舶设计研究成果，被称为“90年代未来型”。此事在国际造船业中引起一阵轰动，国际海事界的一位权威人士评论说：“如果这条船能造，那么可以毫不夸张地说，没有什么船沪东造船厂不能造！”
    两年后，当这条被命名为“柏林快航号”的船伴随着阵阵欢呼，从船台上轰然作响滑入水中时，这无疑是中国造船业又一个光辉的瞬间。
    回首当年，中国造船业是被“逼上梁山”的。
    历史上，我国的造船业也曾有过辉煌的时刻。明代，三保太监郑和率两万七千余人的大船队，浩浩荡荡七下西洋，无疑地证明了当时造船业的业绩。
    然而到了清朝，我国造船业一天天衰败。到解放前夕，全国只剩20多家钢质船厂，在连年战乱的风雨中飘摇。堂堂中华，沿海内河跑的都是外国船。
    1949年，新中国诞生了，造船业也获得了新生。40年来，造船业走过了艰难曲折的路，取得了辉煌的业绩。造船厂500多家，全国已建起造船总产量达2090万吨。40年前，我国船用设备制造领域绝大部分是空白，研究设计的专门机构则完全空白。今天，全国已有各种研究设计院所80多个，已建设起配套完整的造船工业体系。
    尤其值得大书一笔的，是近十年造船业的迅速发展。这十年中，先是主管中国造船工业的六机部（后改为中国船舶工业总公司）经过国民经济调整，削减军品，30万造船大军的吃饭忽然成了问题。
    怎么办？中国改革的总设计师邓小平同志当时曾两次对六机部领导说：“中国船舶要打进国际市场。”
    可是，中国造船业与世隔绝太久，外面的世界也根本不知道中国造船业是什么样。这时候，船王包玉刚的弟弟包玉星表示，愿意把原本打算在日本造的船拿到国内来造。包玉刚也宣布拿出1亿美元在中国订船。这一举动，使中国造船人喜出望外，同时，它也似乎成为一种号召，随后，中国与其他国家的船东又签订了一系列合同。
    中国按国际标准建造出口船，是迈向国际市场的第一步。巨大的压力激发出巨大的潜力。从谈判到签约，从设计到制造，每个环节都高度紧张。708研究所的设计师们夜以继日，工作时间突破一日10小时，甚至达到16小时。大连造船厂更是拿出了“窝头加咸菜造船”的拚命精神。整个六机部上上下下都为建造包玉星“长城号”船开绿灯……当“长城号”如期交付时，包玉星用“世界第一流水平”来评价它。
    一炮打响，中国造船业在国际市场赢得了信誉。正如英国劳氏船级社主席当时所说：“长城号开辟了中国造船的新纪元。”从1978年到1988年，船舶工业总公司累计承接出口民用船250多万吨，加上其他出口产品，成交总金额22亿多美元。承接出口船的吨位，从万吨级发展到十万吨级；品种从一般运输船发展到集装箱船、三用工作船和滚装船、冷藏船、大型冷风冷藏集装箱船等特种船舶；地区从香港发展到世界五大洲20多个国家和地区。
    历史证明了中国造船业这种选择的正确：从1973年至1987年，世界造船业经历了有史以来最严重的萧条时期，1979年到1981年是这个萧条期中的小回升。1980年，中央外贸体制作重大改革，六机部得到了至关重要的外贸权，实现了工贸结合，使得中国造船业恰在此时得以进入国际市场，并靠我们优良的质量、低廉的价格，在国际市场崛起。
    通过船舶出口，使我国船舶工业技术水平实现了跳跃性的发展，10年走了20年的路，产品从60年代水平一跃而到80年代水平。我们掌握了国际规范，提高了设计水平。我们引进了48项国外名牌船用设备制造技术，并使出口船的国产化能力达到70％。我们还引进了一批先进设备，改造了一批造船厂，提高了管理水平。
    10年，多少艰辛，多少困惑，多少个欢乐的瞬间。
    瞬间结束了落后的过去，但能不能开启强大的未来，这是摆在我们面前的又一新课题。
