Hurricane Hugo Makes Landfall in the U.S.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 22nd — Correspondent Cang Lide reports: Hurricane Hugo, a powerful storm, swept through the coastal regions of North and South Carolina today, resulting in at least 11 deaths and billions of dollars in property damage. President Bush has declared the hardest-hit areas as disaster zones.

Early this morning, this once-in-a-century hurricane made landfall in Charleston, Barrier Islands, and other areas with wind speeds exceeding 210 kilometers per hour. It generated waves as high as four to five meters and brought torrential rain. The hurricane's path left houses collapsed, bridges destroyed, and cars swept into floodwaters. Boats were even pushed onto roads. Prior to the storm, most local residents had received notices from the state government to evacuate to safer areas.

Days before, Hurricane Hugo had devastated the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, causing significant loss of life and property. Currently, the hurricane is moving northward, and its intensity has significantly weakened.

    “雨果”飓风在美登陆
    本报华盛顿9月22日电　记者仓立德报道：“雨果”强烈飓风今天横扫了美国南、北卡罗来纳两州沿海地区，造成至少11人死亡及数10亿美元的财产损失。布什总统已将受害最烈地区宣布为“灾区”。
    今日凌晨，这场当地百年未遇的飓风以每小时210多公里的速度在查尔斯顿、巴里尔群岛等地登陆，卷起四五米高的海浪，并带来倾盆大雨。飓风中心所经之处，房屋倒塌，桥梁断裂；汽车被冲入洪水，游艇被推上了公路。此前当地大部分居民已接到州政府通知，撤离到安全地带。
      “雨果”飓风数日前曾席卷了加勒比海的维尔京群岛、波多黎各等地，使当地居民生命财产遭到惨重损失。目前飓风正逐渐向北移动，风势已大为减弱。
