In the northwest corner of Gansu, deep within the rarely visited Badain Jaran Desert, stand two monumental achievements of China: the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center and the mysterious missile city, the Northwest Air Force Missile Test Base. These two "proud children of the desert" have achieved remarkable feats that have drawn global attention and instilled pride in every Chinese person.

The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center has erected milestone after milestone for China's aerospace industry: China's first artificial Earth satellite was launched from here; China's first recoverable satellite took off from here; China's first long-range carrier rocket was launched from here; the feat of sending three artificial satellites into space with a single rocket was accomplished here; and China's first satellite, launched for a foreign country, also took off from here. Out of the 25 artificial Earth satellites launched by China, 19 were launched from this center. Among them, the 11 recoverable satellites launched from here have a 100% success rate, placing China at the forefront of the world.

Adjacent to the aerospace city is the missile city, the Northwest Air Force Missile Test Base, known as the "cradle of divine arrows." All of China's surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles have received their "passports" and been equipped to the military from here. Over the past 31 years, more than 3,000 surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles have been tested here, completing numerous test, analysis, verification, and type-testing tasks for high, medium, and low-altitude, medium, long, and short-range missiles with various guidance methods. Batch after batch of new "divine arrows" have been delivered to the air force units.

The saplings planted by the first pioneers in the Gobi desert in 1958 have now grown into lush green trees. People revere those who have struggled and selflessly contributed to China's aerospace and missile industries. The republic will never forget their great achievements.

　　大漠骄子壮国威
    在甘肃的西北角、人迹罕至的巴丹吉林大沙漠深处，赫然屹立着中国的航天城——酒泉卫星发射中心和神奇的导弹城——西北空军导弹试验基地。这两座“大漠骄子”所取得的成就，令世人瞩目，令每一个中国人自豪。
    酒泉卫星发射中心，曾为我国航天事业的发展建造过一座又一座里程碑：我国第一颗人造地球卫星在这里升起；我国第一颗返回式人造地球卫星在这里腾空；我国第一枚远程运载火箭在这里发射；我国第一次用一枚火箭将三颗人造卫星送上太空的壮举在这里实现；我国第一次承揽为外国提供搭载业务的卫星，也是在这里上天的。我国发射的25颗人造地球卫星中，有19颗是在这里发射的。其中，从这里发射的11颗可回收卫星，成功率达100％，居于世界前列。
    与航天城相邻的导弹城——西北空军导弹试验基地，人称“神箭摇篮”。我国所有的地空、空空导弹，都是从这里领取“通行证”、装备部队的。31年来，这里先后进行了3000枚地空、空空导弹的发射试验，完成了包括高、中、低空，中、远、近程以及各种制导方式的数十种型号导弹的测试、分析、检验、定型试验任务，将一批批新型“神箭”送到空军部队。
    1958年第一批创业者们在戈壁荒滩上栽下的树苗如今已绿荫如盖。人们崇敬那些为我国的航天事业、导弹事业艰苦奋斗、无私奉献的人，共和国永远不会忘记他们的丰功伟绩。（邓元秋）
