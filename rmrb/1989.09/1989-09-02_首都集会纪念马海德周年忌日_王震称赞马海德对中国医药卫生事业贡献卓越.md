The Ministry of Health, the Medical and Health Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the China International Friendship Association, and the Bureau of Foreign Experts held a meeting today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the late Norman Bethune, an outstanding internationalist who dedicated 55 years of his life to the Chinese revolution. Vice Chairman Wang Zhen attended and delivered a speech.

Wang Zhen praised this first foreigner to become a Chinese citizen after the founding of New China for his selfless dedication to the development of China's medical and health services, making outstanding contributions. As a well-known social activist, he tirelessly promoted the reform and opening-up policies of the Communist Party of China since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, helping many foreign friends to better understand the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and China's modernization drive.

Hab Zhimou, Kang Keqing, and other relevant international friends attended the meeting. Before the meeting, Vice Chairman Wang Zhen also warmly received Bethune's wife Sophie and her relatives who had come from abroad. An exhibition of Bethune's life and achievements began today at the Military Museum.

    王震称赞马海德对中国医药卫生事业贡献卓越
    本报北京9月2日讯　记者艾笑报道：卫生部、政协医卫体委员会、对外友协和外国专家局今天在北京人民大会堂召开会议，纪念为中国革命事业忘我奋斗55个春秋的杰出国际主义战士马海德逝世一周年。王震副主席出席并讲了话。
    王震称赞这位新中国成立后第一个加入中国籍的外国人，为发展中国的医药卫生事业鞠躬尽瘁，做出了卓越贡献。作为一位知名的社会活动家，在广泛的国际交往中，他还不知疲倦地宣传中国共产党十一届三中全会以来的改革开放政策，使许多外国朋友加深了对中国共产党、对中国政府、中国的四化建设事业的了解。
    习仲勋、康克清等及有关国际友人参加了今天的大会。会前，王震副主席还亲切接见了马海德的夫人苏菲及其专程从国外赶来的亲属。马海德生平事迹图片展览今天起在军事博物馆开始展出。
