The dream of studying in the United States finally came true for 17 Yugoslavian students as they boarded the plane to New York.

They had no need to worry about the future, as everything had been arranged. Not long ago, each of them paid $2,900 to an organization based in the western United States that specializes in arranging study abroad for foreign students. The organization promised to send someone to meet them at New York's Kennedy International Airport, arrange their transfer to a high school in California, and have them live with "carefully selected, warm-hearted American families."

The dream was short-lived. From the moment they stepped out of Kennedy International Airport, the 17 Yugoslavian youths found themselves in a predicament: no one was there to meet them, no one had arranged their tickets to California, and there were no "warm-hearted American families." All they had was a narrow house with beds laid out on the floor. They had to buy their own food and cook their own meals. When it was time to go to school, they discovered that the school had no idea who they were.

This incident occurred last autumn. Some education professionals in the United States noticed that similar incidents have been increasing recently.

As the number of young people decreases, American universities have been increasingly focused on recruiting foreign students in recent years. In 1987 and 1988, the number of foreign high school and college graduates registered in American universities reached 356,200. Some private organizations, in order to help expand recruitment, began acting as intermediaries, arranging for foreign students to study in the United States. Some of these organizations were unprepared, while others lacked the strength to handle the tasks, inevitably leading to mistakes. However, there were also those who took advantage of the situation to cheat and deceive.

The Foreign Student Information Exchange Center in Washington has information on 900 organizations that recruit foreign students. They often receive complaint letters from foreign students, accusing "intermediaries" of cheating and deceit. Whenever such a letter is received, the exchange center sends a survey form to the organization being complained about. However, the results are often ignored, and the exchange center has no other recourse but to complain.

In response to this situation, some American educational organizations recently issued warnings to foreign students who are in the process of arranging to study in the United States, advising them to be cautious of "intermediaries" and to beware of being cheated.

　　留学“梦”的阴影
　　斯韧
    去美国学习的梦想终于实现了，17位南斯拉夫中学生登上了飞往纽约的班机。
    他们用不着为未来发愁，一切都已安排妥善。不久前，他们每人向设在美国西部的一个专门安排外国留学生的组织交了2900美元。那个组织答应派人在纽约机场接他们，安排他们转机去加利福尼亚州的一所高中就读。在那里，他们将与经过“精心挑选的热情好客的美国家庭”生活在一起。
    好梦不长。从走出纽约肯尼迪国际机场开始，17位南斯拉夫青年便陷入困境：没有人接他们，没有人为他们安排去加利福尼亚的机票，也没有什么“热情好客的美国家庭”。有的只是一幢狭窄的小屋，铺在地板上的“床”。菜要自己买，饭得自己做。等到要去上学了，又发现那所学校压根就不知道他们是谁。
    这件事发生在去年秋天。美国教育界的一些人士注意到，最近，类似的事情正在增多。
    随着青年人数的减少，美国各大学近年来越来越注意招收外国学生。1987年和1988年，在美国大学注册的外国高中和大学毕业生达356200人。一些民间组织为了帮助扩大招生，开始充当中间人，安排外国学生到美国学习。这些组织有的准备不足，有的力量单薄，难免会出现差错。但也不乏招摇撞骗之徒从中渔利。
    设在华盛顿的招收外国学生信息交换所掌握着900个招收外国留学生的各类组织。他们常收到外国留学生寄来的投诉信，抱怨“中间人”谋财骗人。每当接到这样的信，交换所就给投诉信指责的招生组织寄去一份调查表。可结果石沉大海，除了抱怨，交换所也别无他法。
    针对这种状况，美国一些教育组织最近发出警告，要正在联系去美国留学的外国学生注意“中间人”，谨防上当。
