Guangdong Takes the Lead in Reform and Opening Up: Economic Development Enters "Golden Age"

— An Interview with Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Lin Ruo

Guangdong, which took the lead in reform and opening up, has undergone what changes in the past 10 years? To this end, the reporter recently interviewed Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Lin Ruo.

Guangdong is located on the front line of national defense. Before 1978, its economic growth was slow, lagging behind the national average for 13 consecutive years. When the reporter mentioned the past, Comrade Lin Ruo happily continued: In the 10 years since the reform and opening up, various levels of the Party organizations in Guangdong have led the masses to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies of the Party's Eleventh Central Committee since the Third Plenary Session, and to implement the "special policies and flexible measures" assigned by the central government. They have vigorously developed socialist planned commodity economy, and the province's economy has entered the most prosperous "golden age" in history.

The reporter learned that under the conditions of reform and opening up, Guangdong mainly relied on self-raised funds for construction, which quickly developed the economy. In the past 10 years, the new fixed assets of state-owned enterprises in the province have reached 66.9 billion yuan, equivalent to 3.6 times the total of the previous 29 years. This has formed new industrial production capacity, and more than half of the old enterprises have updated their technological equipment, strengthened economic strength, and ensured that the economy has maintained stable and continuous growth for 10 years. The province's total social output value increased by an average of 15.2% per year; the gross national product increased by an average of 12.9% per year; the national income increased by an average of 12.2% per year; and fiscal revenue increased by an average of 10.5% per year. With this speed, which is higher than the "Four Asian Tigers" during their take-off period in the 1960s and 1970s, not only has the long-term lag in Guangdong's economic development behind the national average been reversed, but its contribution to the country has also become increasingly significant.

"Guangdong's economic development is the result of various levels of Party committees and governments in the province leading the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people to resolutely implement the special policies and flexible measures given by the central government and to take the lead in reform and opening up," said Comrade Lin Ruo. He pointed out that Guangdong's greatest characteristic and advantage is that it is "located in the subtropical zone, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, and has a large number of overseas Chinese." However, before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the condition of "closing the country," this advantage could not be fully utilized. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee approved Guangdong to implement special policies and flexible measures in foreign economic activities, thus enabling Guangdong to combine the central policies with the province's geographical and human advantages, and to timely utilize the opportunities of international economic adjustments, promoting the development of the entire social economy.

In the past 10 years, Guangdong has, through the "three-come-one-compensate" and joint ventures and cooperation, on a large scale utilized foreign capital, introduced advanced technology and equipment, and achieved gratifying results. In the past 10 years, the province's export earnings have reached $33.53 billion, equivalent to 2.6 times the total of the 29 years before the reform and opening up. Now, 1/4 of Guangdong's gross national product is realized in the international market; 1/4 of the national income comes from abroad; and 1/3 of the construction funds come from the international market.

The above figures prove from one aspect that Guangdong's economic development is not accidental. Some people who do not understand the situation think that Guangdong is "fed with special treatment" and made rich by improper business practices, which is completely a misunderstanding. Guangdong's implementation of "special policies and flexible measures" not only has not dug into the national financial foundation, but has also contributed more and more to the country.

In the past 10 years, in addition to taking the lead in reform and opening up, exploring the way for the country, and playing a radiating role of external attraction and internal connection, Guangdong has also, due to economic development, increased its contributions to the country from various channels. In the past 10 years, the total amount of Guangdong's remittances to the central government has increased by nearly 2 times on the same basis, and the net remittance to the central government has increased at a rate higher than the increase in local finance. In addition, the customs duties obtained by the central government in Guangdong's ports have increased by dozens of times, and the profits remitted by the banking system to the central government have increased from several billion yuan to more than 30 billion yuan. In 10 years, the province has absorbed 24 million laborers from outside the province, earning 8 billion yuan each year.

When talking about Guangdong's contribution to the country, Comrade Lin Ruo repeatedly emphasized to the reporter: Guangdong is China's Guangdong, and every achievement of taking the lead is the result of national cooperation; Guangdong has developed, and naturally should contribute more to the country. Guangdong's tremendous changes in the past 10 years fully prove that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct. Although Guangdong still has various shortcomings and encounters many difficulties in its progress, the basic practice of Guangdong is successful. Reform and opening up have better played the superiority of socialism, and the people have benefited from it, been educated by it, and seen the hope for the future, thus supporting the Party and socialism more. Therefore, since the reform and opening up, Guangdong's environment has been relatively stable. Even when a few people used the turmoil to incite political unrest and developed it into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people in Guangdong Province were able to distinguish right from wrong, consciously resist the bourgeois liberalization ideology against the Party and socialism, and resolutely oppose the turmoil, maintaining a good situation of stability and unity in Guangdong Province.

Comrade Lin Ruo said with confidence when seeing off the reporter: "Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we have the confidence to make the reform and opening up and construction better and more stable. We must closely unite around the Party Central Committee, resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up, and do a good job in Guangdong's comprehensive reform experiment task."

    广东改革开放先走一步
　　经济发展进入“黄金时代”
　　——访中共广东省委书记林若
    改革开放先走一步的广东省，10年来有什么变化？为此，记者最近访问了中共广东省委书记林若。
    广东地处国防前沿，1978年前经济增长较慢，连续13年低于全国平均发展速度。记者谈起过去，林若同志高兴地接着说：改革开放以来的10年，广东各级党组织带领广大人民坚决贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，执行中央赋予的“特殊政策、灵活措施”，大力发展社会主义有计划的商品经济，全省经济发展进入了有史以来最为兴旺的“黄金时代”。
    记者获悉，广东在改革开放的条件下，主要依靠自筹资金搞建设，使经济得到很快的发展。10年来，全省全民所有制单位新增固定资产就达669亿元，相当于前29年总和的3.6倍。由此形成了新的工业生产能力，并使半数以上老企业的技术装备得到更新改造，经济实力得到加强，使这10年间经济持续稳定增长，全省社会总产值年均增长15.2％；国民生产总值年均增长12.9％；国民收入年均增长12.2％；财政收入年均增长10.5％。用这种高于“亚洲四小龙”在六、七十年代起飞时期的速度持续稳定增长，不仅扭转了广东经济发展长期落后于全国平均水平的状况，而且对国家的贡献越来越大。
      “广东经济的发展，是全省各级党委、政府带领广大党员、干部和群众坚决执行中央给予的特殊政策、灵活措施，在改革开放中先走一步的结果。”林若同志谈到这里，指出广东的最大特点、最大优势是“地处亚热带、毗邻港澳、华侨众多”。但在党的十一届三中全会以前，在“闭关锁国”的情况下，这种优势无法发挥。十一届三中全会以后，党中央批准广东在对外经济活动中实行特殊政策、灵活措施，从而使广东得以把中央政策同本省的地理、人文优势结合起来，及时利用国际经济调整的机遇，促进了整个社会经济的发展。
    广东在这10年间，通过“三来一补”和合资合作等形式，大规模利用外资，引进先进技术设备，取得了可喜的成果。10年来，全省出口创汇335.3亿美元，相当于改革开放前29年总和的2.6倍。现在的广东，国民生产总值有1／4是在国际市场上实现其价值的；国民收入有1／4来自境外；建设资金有1／3来自国际市场。
    上述这些数字从一个侧面证明，广东经济的发展不是偶然的。一些不了解情况的人以为广东是靠“吃小灶”喂肥的，靠不正当经商发财的，那完全是一种误解。广东执行“特殊政策、灵活措施”，不仅没有挖国家财政的墙脚，反而对国家贡献越来越大。
    这10年间，广东除了在改革开放中先走一步，为全国探路，发挥外引内联的辐射作用等方面做出了贡献外，还由于经济的发展，从各种渠道收入上缴中央的也多了。10年来，广东上缴中央财政总额按同口径比增长近2倍，净上缴中央财政的增长幅度高于地方财政的增长幅度。另外，与广东实行改革开放政策密切相关的中央在粤口岸取得的关税增加几十倍，银行系统上缴中央的利润从几亿元增至30多亿元。10年全省吸收省外劳工2400万，每年从中收入80亿元。
    当谈到广东对国家的贡献时，林若同志反复向记者强调：广东是中国的广东，先走一步的每个成就都是全国大协作的结果；广东发展了，自然应当对国家多作贡献。广东10年来的巨大变化，充分证明党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策是正确的。尽管广东目前还存在这样那样的不足，前进中遇到不少困难，但是广东的基本实践是成功的。改革开放更好地发挥了社会主义优越性，使人民群众得到了实惠，也得到了教育，看到了今后的希望，从而更加拥护党，拥护社会主义。所以，自改革开放以来，广东的环境比较稳定。即使在前段极少数人利用学潮、掀起政治动乱、进而在北京发展成为反革命暴乱时，广东省广大党员、干部和群众也能够明辨是非，自觉抵制反党反社会主义的资产阶级自由化思潮，坚决反对动乱，较好地维护了广东省安定团结的局面。
    林若同志在送别记者时，充满信心地说：“回顾过去，展望未来，我们有信心把改革开放和建设搞得比过去更稳、更好。我们一定要紧密地团结在党中央周围，坚决贯彻党的十三届四中全会的精神，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，把广东的综合改革试验的任务搞好。”
