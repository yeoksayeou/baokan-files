Investigation and Reflection

Minimize Student Dropouts

From January to April 1988, our court handled 87 cases involving juveniles under the age of 20. Among them, 71 were dropouts from middle school, accounting for 81.6%.

These dropouts exhibited three notable characteristics in their criminal behavior:

First, a high incidence of gang-related crimes. Out of the 71 juvenile offenders, 63 were involved in gang-related crimes, while only 8 committed crimes individually.

Second, a lack of awareness. According to court investigations, approximately half of these juvenile offenders did not recognize that their actions constituted a crime or had an inadequate understanding of their criminal behavior. For instance, Li Xisheng, a 17-year-old from Liangshan Village, Xiaowupu Township in our district, dropped out of school and lured a 5-year-old girl into sexual acts without realizing it was a crime.

Third, an escalating pattern. After dropping out, these juvenile offenders often progressed from petty theft to more violent crimes such as armed robbery, rape, and even murder. Their criminal methods also became more sophisticated, with some using drugs to facilitate robberies and others forging documents to commit fraud. For example, Wen Guichang and five others from our district's Yaotianping Township started with simple theft but later used anesthetic drugs to commit robberies. Another example is Xia Shifeng and four others who, within seven days, used triangular razors to break into homes and commit nine robberies, two street robberies, and injured one person. Prior to this, they had only stolen oranges from farmers. 

The aforementioned phenomena should alert relevant departments and parents to take measures to minimize middle school dropouts, strengthen legal education, and create a favorable social environment for the healthy growth of young people.

### 尽量减少学生辍学

    尽量减少学生辍学
    1988年1至4月，我院审结的87名20岁以下的青少年犯中，有71名是近几年流入社会的中学辍学生，占81.6％。
    这些辍学生犯罪具有3个特点：
    一是团伙犯罪的多。71名青少年犯中，有63名是团伙作案，单个犯罪的只有8名；
    二是盲目性。据庭审调查，约有半数的青少年犯在犯罪时，没有认识自己的行为已构成犯罪或对自己的罪行认识不够。我区肖伍铺乡梁山村17岁的李西胜退学后，诱奸了1名5岁的幼女还不认为是犯罪。
    三是演变性。这些青少年犯退学后，往往由小偷小摸发展到持刀抢劫、强奸乃至杀人等暴力犯罪。犯罪手段也趋于复杂化，有的使用麻醉手段抢劫，有的伪造证件行骗。例如我区尧天坪乡文桂章等6人辍学后，开始仅作一般的盗窃活动，后发展到使用麻醉药实施抢劫。再如，夏世文等5人，在7天时间内，持三角刮刀入户抢劫9次，拦路抢劫2次，伤及一人。在此之前，他们也只是偷摸农民的柑桔。
    上述现象应引起有关部门以及家长的重视，采取措施，尽量减少中小学生辍学，加强法制教育，为青少年的健康成长创造良好的社会环境。　湖南常德市鼎城区人民法院　高英明
