Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th.

Wang Renzhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said in an interview that the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the principles of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "sharing weal and woe," must be upheld throughout the entire socialist period and continually improved and developed in practice. This is an important feature and advantage of China's political life.

Wang Renzhong emphasized that in today's China, if we do not implement the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, but instead adopt a multi-party system or turn the parties outside the Communist Party into opposition parties, it would be completely wrong and would not be in line with China's reality or the interests of the broad masses of the people.

September 21st marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Wang Renzhong introduced to the reporter the achievements and experiences of the CPPCC over the past 40 years and elaborated on issues such as the Communist Party's leadership in multi-party cooperation, political consultation, and democratic supervision.

Wang Renzhong recalled that 40 years ago, the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference elected the Central People's Government with Mao Zedong as Chairman, proclaiming the birth of the People's Republic of China. It can be said that the convening of the CPPCC marked the victory of the Chinese revolution and the beginning of a new stage in the Chinese revolution—transitioning from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution and construction.

Wang Renzhong pointed out that the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party has played a significant role in the history of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao said in the "Foreword to the Publication of 'Communist'" that the three magic weapons of the Communist Party of China in the Chinese revolution are the Communist Party armed with Marxism, armed struggle, and the united front. Relying on these three magic weapons, we defeated Chiang Kai-shek and liberated the whole of China. After national liberation, China firmly took the socialist road. Over the past 40 years, we have achieved great successes in the construction of our socialist republic, and our great motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Practice has proven that the progress made in New China is unparalleled compared to the impoverished and backward Old China.

Wang Renzhong said that the CPPCC, as an organization of the patriotic united front, was historically formed and developed and strengthened through the long-term cooperation between the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life. Our Party has always attached great importance to the work of the CPPCC. The Chairman of the first National Committee of the CPPCC was Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Chairmen of the second, third, and fourth National Committees were Comrade Zhou Enlai. After the "Cultural Revolution," Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, and Li Xiannian successively served as Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC. Through thick and thin, with united efforts, we strive for the prosperity of the country and the revitalization of the nation, and strive for the realization of the great cause of socialist modernization. Fully carrying forward democracy and adhering to the principle of democratic centralism are the fine traditions of the CPPCC. The CPPCC has the duty and responsibility to assist the Party and the government in running the country well. We should, through the work of the CPPCC and the joint efforts of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all ethnic groups and walks of life, further improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and promote the smooth development of various undertakings.

Wang Renzhong believes that as an organizational form of the patriotic united front, the CPPCC is an important way to implement multi-party cooperation, carry forward people's democracy, and connect with people from all walks of life. The important functions of the CPPCC are political consultation and democratic supervision. We should fully play this role, consult on major state policies and important issues concerning the people's livelihood, listen more to the voices of the people, and seriously listen to the opinions of all parties. The "Provisional Regulations on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision" adopted by the Fourth Session of the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC is a step forward for the CPPCC towards the regularization and institutionalization of political consultation and democratic supervision. The CPPCC has the duty and responsibility, through its work, to widely unite and connect people from all ethnic groups and walks of life, mobilize the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, and assist the Party and the government in running the country well.

    王任重就人民政协成立四十周年发表谈话
    共产党领导多党合作和政协制度
    在整个社会主义时期都必须坚持
    新华社北京9月20日电（记者邹爱国）全国政协副主席王任重在接受记者采访时说，共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，“长期共存、互相监督”，“肝胆相照、荣辱与共”的方针，在整个社会主义时期都必须坚持，并在实践中不断完善和发展。这是我国政治生活一个重要特点和优点。
    王任重强调说，在当今中国，如果不实行共产党领导的多党合作，而搞什么多党制，或者把共产党以外的各党派搞成什么反对党，是完全错误的，既不符合中国的实际，也不符合广大人民的利益。
    今年9月21日是中国人民政治协商会议成立40周年。王任重向记者介绍了人民政协40年来的成就和经验，并就共产党领导的多党合作、政治协商、民主监督等问题作了阐述。
    王任重回忆说，40年前，中国人民政治协商会议第一次会议选举产生了以毛泽东同志为主席的中央人民政府，宣告中华人民共和国的诞生。可以说，人民政协的召开标志着中国革命的胜利，标志着中国革命进入了一个新的阶段。这就是从新民主主义革命进入社会主义革命和建设的新阶段。
    王任重指出，中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，在中国革命的历史上起了重大的作用。毛主席在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》中讲过，以马克思主义武装起来的中国共产党、武装斗争、统一战线，是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三大法宝。我们依靠这三大法宝，打倒了蒋介石，解放了全中国。全国解放以后，中国坚定不移地走上了社会主义道路。40年来，我们社会主义共和国的建设取得了伟大的成就，我们伟大的祖国发生了翻天覆地的变化。实践证明，新中国取得的进步是贫困落后的旧中国所无法比拟的。
    王任重说，人民政协作为爱国统一战线的组织是历史形成的，是在中国共产党与各民主党派、人民团体和各界人士长期合作共事的过程中发展壮大的。我们党历来很重视政协的工作，一届全国政协主席是毛泽东同志，二、三、四届全国政协主席是周恩来同志。“文革”以后，邓小平、邓颖超、李先念同志相继担任全国政协主席。风雨同舟，和衷共济，共图国家的昌盛和民族的兴旺，共图社会主义现代化伟大事业的实现，充分发扬民主、坚持民主集中制，是人民政协的优良传统。人民政协有义务有责任协助党和政府，把国家的事情办好。我们要通过人民政协的工作，通过中国共产党和各民主党派、人民团体、各族各界人士的共同努力，进一步完善共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，促进各项事业的顺利发展。
    王任重认为，作为爱国统一战线组织形式的人民政协，是实行多党合作，发扬人民民主，联系各方面人民群众的一个重要形式。人民政协的重要职能是政治协商和民主监督。我们要充分发挥这个职能，对国家大政方针和群众生活的重要问题进行协商，多多倾听人民群众的呼声，认真听取各方面的意见。全国政协七届四次常委会通过的《关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》，是人民政协向政治协商、民主监督经常化、制度化方向迈进了一步。人民政协有义务、有责任通过自己的工作，广泛团结和联系各族各界人士，调动各方面群众的积极性，协助党和政府把国家的事情办好。
