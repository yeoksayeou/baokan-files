Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th.

According to a press conference held by the Ministry of Water Resources and the State Meteorological Administration, the weather and climate conditions for this year's national agricultural production are better than last year, making it a generally favorable year. If there are no major natural disasters in the next month and local labor forces take preventive measures against disasters, achieving a bumper autumn grain harvest is very promising.

The main characteristics of the climate since the rainy season this year are as follows: the south has abundant rainfall, frequent heavy rains, and severe flooding in some areas; most of the north has less rain, with severe droughts in parts of Northeast China and North China; the temperature in most parts of the country is normal or higher than normal, with suitable light and heat conditions; there have been many typhoons making landfall, but the damage is not severe; hailstorms are close to the average.

As of September 20th, during the rainy season, 21 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have experienced localized heavy rain and floods, affecting 190 million mu of land, with 91.42 million mu of land severely affected. The provinces of Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi have experienced the most severe damage. After the onset of the summer heat, more than 10 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have experienced severe droughts, affecting 280 million mu of land, with Shandong, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia being the most severely affected. Some northern cities are also facing water shortages. However, from a national perspective, this year's flood and drought situations are generally average.

    水利气象部门认为
    今年气候一般偏好
    秋粮丰收很有希望
    本报北京9月25日讯　记者谢联辉报道：从水利部、国家气象局新闻发布会上获悉，今年全国农业生产的天气气候条件比去年要好，属一般偏好的年份。如果今后一个月内全国无大范围自然灾害，各地劳力做好灾害预防，夺取秋粮丰收很有希望。
    今年入汛以来气候的主要特点是：南方雨水丰沛，暴雨比较频繁，局部地区洪涝较重；北方大部少雨，东北和华北部分地区伏旱严重；全国大部地区气温正常或偏高，光热条件适宜；登陆台风多，灾情不算严重；风雹灾害接近常年。
    截至9月20日统计，汛期内有21个省市自治区发生局部暴雨洪水，受灾面积1.9亿亩，成灾面积9142万亩，其中四川、浙江、江西灾情较重；入伏后10多个省市自治区旱情严重，受旱面积达2.8亿亩，其中山东、辽宁、内蒙古最为严重；有些北方城市缺水。但从全国来看，今年汛情、旱情属一般年份。
