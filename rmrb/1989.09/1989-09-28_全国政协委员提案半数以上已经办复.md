The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCCC) reported that relevant departments of the central government and state organs have actively handled the proposals submitted by CPCCC members. By the end of August, the CPCCC proposal office had received 1,698 replies from the relevant handling units, with a reply rate of 63.4%. It is understood that during the second session of the seventh National Committee of the CPCCC, a total of 1,818 proposals were submitted by members. Many handling units, through visiting CPCCC members, exchanging views on proposals, and other forms, have strengthened mutual relations, enhanced mutual understanding, opened up channels for democratic supervision, and increased the transparency of government work, which has been widely welcomed and praised by the members. It is reported that the CPCCC proposal office has sent a letter on September 11 to urge the handling of proposals that have not yet been replied to. The work is currently being expedited.
