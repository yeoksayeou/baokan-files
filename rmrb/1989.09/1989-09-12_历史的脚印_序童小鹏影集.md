Title: Footprints of History

The photographic collection *Footprints of History* by Tong Xiaopeng has been published. This is his second collection. His first collection, *The Second United Front*, was a "mixed" collection, including photographs taken by others. This new collection features only his own outstanding works.

Comrade Tong Xiaopeng began amateur photography in early 1937, and has been at it for over fifty years. He has accumulated thousands of photographs. This selected collection is a part of his work.

From Chen Sheng and Wu Guang onwards, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle against feudalism has lasted for over two thousand years. From the Opium War onwards, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism has lasted for over a hundred years. These two revolutions were victorious in 1949 under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Adding to this the success of socialist transformation and the achievements of socialist construction, our generation has much to be proud of! However, due to various reasons, the activities of the Communists were not recorded photographically before 1936.

In 1936, American journalist Edgar Snow came to Baojian (now Zhidan County) in Shaanxi and wrote the book *Red Star Over China*, taking photographs. This book could not be published in China under its original title at that time and was published under the title *Journey to the West*, facing many difficulties. It was precisely because of these difficulties that the book has value.

Tong Xiaopeng began his photographic work after Snow's visit to Shaanxi. At that time, the "Xi'an Incident" was peacefully resolved, and the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began. Xiaopeng has his advantages compared to Mr. Snow: he is Chinese and a Communist Party cadre. The photographs he took naturally have their own characteristics.

After I was released from prison, I learned that Comrade Tong Xiaopeng had many photographs and asked him to publish them as soon as possible. However, due to his busy official duties, it was delayed for many years. After 1982, he retired to the second line and finally had the time to do this. By doing this, he also compensated for one of my regrets. Originally, when Mr. Snow left Shaanxi, he left his camera with me, asking me to take some photographs as a record. Due to my lack of perseverance, I was not successful. During the Cultural Revolution, this camera disappeared. Now, if Mr. Snow were still alive, I could present Tong Xiaopeng's collection to him, and he would certainly be pleased.

Finally, I recommend to the readers: the photographs in this collection about the founding ceremony are the only color photographs recording this ceremony.

    历史的脚印
　　——序童小鹏影集
　　陆定一
    童小鹏摄影资料选集——《历史的脚印》出版了，这是他的第二部影集。他的第一部影集是《第二次国共合作》，那是“混编”的，即还集有别人拍摄的照片在内。现在这一部影集，都是他本人的佳作。
    童小鹏同志从1937年初开始从事业余摄影，至今已五十多年。他积存着数千张照片。这本选集是其中的一部分。
    从陈胜、吴广算起，中国人民的反封建主义的革命斗争，进行了二千多年；从鸦片战争算起，中国人民的反帝国主义的革命斗争，进行了一百多年。这两个革命，到1949年，才在中国共产党的领导下取得胜利。加上社会主义改造的成功和社会主义建设的成就，我们这一代人是很可以自豪的！但是，由于种种原因，在1936年以前，共产党人的活动没有用摄影的方法记录下来。
    1936年，美国记者埃德加·斯诺来到陕北保安（现名志丹县）写了《红星照耀中国》一书，拍了照片。这本书在中国当时不能以原名出版，改用《西行漫记》作书名，公之于世。其艰难可想而知。惟其艰难，所以才有价值。
    童小鹏同志开始从事摄影，在时间上说，是在斯诺访问陕北之后，那时，“双十二事变”和平解决，国共两党第二次合作开始了。小鹏同志比起斯诺先生来，有他的优势：他是中国人，是共产党的干部。他所拍摄的照片，当然有其特点。
    我从牢里出来以后，知道童小鹏同志拥有许多照片，请他早日整理出版。但是他因公务忙碌，搁了多年。1982年以后，他已退居二线，才有功夫来做这件事。他做了这件事，也使我的一件遗憾得到一定的弥补。原来，斯诺先生离开陕北的时候，把他的照相机留交给我，嘱咐我拍些照片，留作记录。由于我对此没有恒心，未能成功。“文革”大劫，这个照相机不知去向。现在，如果斯诺先生还在，我可以把童小鹏同志的影集，向他交账，他一定会高兴的。
    最后，向读者推荐：本影集中关于开国大典的照片，是记录这个大典的唯一彩色照片。
