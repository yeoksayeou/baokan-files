According to the latest news from China's Great Wall Antarctic Station, the international team crossing the Antarctic continent has successfully passed through the most dangerous ice melt hole area and entered Palmer Land.

This 80-kilometer-long ice melt hole area is covered with snow on the surface, but underneath are melt holes of varying depths, with the deepest reaching over ten meters. The polar dogs pulling the sleds often fall into these holes. The expedition team spent six days, from August 22 to 27, to cross this region. At their slowest, they covered only 36 kilometers in a day.

    南极考察队通过冰融洞区
    新华社北京九月四日电　据中国南极长城站最近消息：国际横穿南极大陆考察队已通过途中最危险的冰融洞区，进入了帕尔默地。
    这片长度为八十公里的冰融洞区，上面被积雪覆盖着，底下是深浅各异的融洞，最深达十多米，拉雪撬的极地狗经常陷进去。考察队从八月二十二日至二十七日，用了六天才穿过这一地区，行进最慢时，一天仅走三十六公里。
