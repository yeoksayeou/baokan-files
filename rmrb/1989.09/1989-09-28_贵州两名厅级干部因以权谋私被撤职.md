The seventh session of the standing committee of the Guizhou Provincial People's Congress today approved a proposal by Governor Wang Chaowen to dismiss Peng Baideng from his position as director of the Guizhou Provincial Forestry Bureau. Additionally, the Guizhou Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government dismissed Shi Huifang, deputy director of the Guizhou Provincial Commerce Bureau, from all her party and administrative positions due to abusing power for personal gain.

Investigations by relevant departments revealed that since 1984, Peng Baideng, as the director and party secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Forestry Bureau, severely violated financial regulations. He arbitrarily misappropriated 14.025 million yuan from the forestry development special fund to build office buildings, dormitories, purchase rationed goods, engage in commercial activities, and establish enterprises, causing incalculable damage to the state's forestry development work. Peng Baideng also engaged in serious abuses of power for personal gain. In early 1987, he used his authority to transfer his son-in-law, who was working at the grassroots level, to the Timber Sales Department of the Forestry Bureau. In August 1988, he personally guaranteed a loan of 100,000 yuan at a preferential interest rate from the Jincheng Trust and Investment Company for his eldest son-in-law to use the bureau's account, and allowed his son-in-law to use this public fund to resell 30 color televisions and engage in business. In early 1985, he wrote notes and made phone calls to the affiliated Forestry Motor Vehicle Depot to sell two Liberation-brand trucks to his younger brother for timber business.

Shi Huifang, the deputy director of the Guizhou Provincial Commerce Bureau responsible for supply and marketing work, abused her power from November 1987 to February 1989 to approve the allocation of 366 tons of fertilizer on eight occasions. Her son, Wang Zhong, acted as an intermediary and collected "information fees" and "brokerage fees" totaling 34,100 yuan. After Wang Zhong's case was exposed, Shi Huifang and her husband (a deputy section-level official in the Provincial Public Security Bureau) discussed conducting a counter-investigation, attempting to fabricate evidence, cover up the mistakes, and shield her son's crimes.

    贵州两名厅级干部因以权谋私被撤职
    新华社贵阳9月26日电　（记者陈云珍）贵州省七届人大常委会第九次会议今天下午审议通过了省长王朝文关于撤销彭百登贵州省林业厅厅长职务的议案；贵州省商业厅副厅长时惠芳，因以权谋私被省委、省政府撤销党内外一切职务。
    经有关部门查实，自1984年以来，身为贵州省林业厅厅长、党组书记的彭百登，严重违反财经法规，任意挪用林业发展专项资金1402.5万元，用于修建办公楼、宿舍、购置控购商品，经商办企业，给国家的林业发展工作造成了不可估量的损失。彭百登在工作中还有严重的以权谋私行为。1987年初，他利用职权，将在基层工作的三女婿调到林业厅木材批发部工作。1988年8月，他又亲自为其大女婿经商作担保，以林业厅所属黔林商场的户头，向金成信托投资公司优息贷款10万元，并让其大女婿用这笔公款倒卖彩电30台和经商做生意。1985年初，他写条、打电话让所属林业汽车场，将两台解放牌汽车出售给其弟搞运输（做木材生意）。
    贵州省商业厅主管供销工作的副厅长时惠芳（女），从1987年11月至1989年2月，利用职权先后8次批化肥366吨，其儿子王忠因充当联系人而索取“信息费”、“中介费”34100元。王忠案发后，时惠芳与丈夫（省公安厅副处级干部）商量进行反调查，企图制造伪证，掩盖错误，推卸责任，包庇其子的罪行。
