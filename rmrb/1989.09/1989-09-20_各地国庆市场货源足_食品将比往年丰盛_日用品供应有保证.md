		BEIJING, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- According to information obtained by reporter Pan Gang from the Ministry of Commerce today, during the National Day holiday, residents will have more abundant food supplies in their baskets compared to previous years, and daily necessities will be largely guaranteed.

		Grain and Oil. Most regions have increased the supply of edible oil and the proportion of fine grains for urban residents. In September, Beijing residents and troops stationed in Beijing will receive an additional supply of enriched flour, green beans, sesame paste, subsidized cooking oil, and bean noodles. Anhui, Qinghai, Fujian, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces have each increased the supply of subsidized cooking oil by 0.5 kg and 0.25 kg per person for urban residents.

The good situation for vegetable supply is rare in recent years. This year is a bumper year for apple production, and various places will have a large supply during the holiday with prices lower than last year.

Qinghai will increase the supply of sugar for herdsmen by 0.25 kg per person during the holiday on top of the regular monthly ration of 0.25 kg per person.

　　各地国庆市场货源足
　　食品将比往年丰盛　日用品供应有保证
    本报北京9月19日讯　记者潘岗今天从商业部获悉，国庆节期间，居民菜篮内的食品将比往年丰盛，日用工业品也绝大部分可以满足供应。
    粮油。多数地区对城镇居民定量的粮油，增加了食油供应数量和细粮的比例。北京城镇居民和驻京部队9月份每人调剂供应部分富强粉、绿豆、芝麻酱、平价食油、粉丝等。安徽、青海、福建、山东和江苏分别对城镇居民每人增供平价食油0.5公斤和0.25公斤。哈尔滨市、福建省粮油供应品种可达20—30种。
    肉禽蛋。天津居民每人增供牛肉0.5公斤。上海居民定量供应的猪肉、牛肉，节日期间比平日增加一倍以上。湖南、河南、哈尔滨、沈阳等省市将投放的猪、牛、羊肉都比上年节日显著增多。
    菜、果。节日期间，多数地区蔬菜供应可以做到数量足、品种多、价格稳中有降。蔬菜供应的好形势是近几年少有的。今年苹果生产是大年，节日期间各地上市多，价格低于去年。
    食糖、糕点、烟酒。城市居民用糖可以保证。青海对牧民在平时定量每月每人0.25公斤的基础上，节日期间每人增供0.25公斤。湖南、河南、青岛、西安、重庆等地对农村节日用糖也都专门安排制定了供应办法。
    水产品货源增长多。天津、哈尔滨节日水产品上市量均可达1000吨，比上年同期大幅度增加。
    日用工业品绝大多数商品货源丰富。前几年供应紧张的商品，如彩色电视机、名牌自行车等，今年销售已经平缓。
