The Power Industry

The second phase of the Ma Village Thermal Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, is basically complete. Construction began in September last year with an investment of approximately 275 million yuan. The first generator unit has been completed and tested, and the second unit is expected to be operational by the end of this year. By then, the province's installed capacity will increase by 400,000 kilowatts compared to before the establishment of the province, achieving a leapfrog development in power supply. The Ma-Yong Power Transmission Project is about to be put into use. Construction began in December last year. A 220,000-volt substation and a 31-kilometer high-voltage transmission line from Ma Village to Yong Village are planned, with an investment of 71.2 million yuan. The distribution room and communication building of the Yong Village substation have been completed, and the main control building has been topped off. It is expected to be operational soon.

The Telecommunications Industry

The West Line 960 Digital Microwave Circuit has been opened. This is the first large-capacity digital microwave communication system used in China. It starts from Haikou City and ends in Sanya City, covering a distance of 449.78 kilometers with a total investment of over 70 million yuan. Construction began in 1984, and it was put into use on July 31, 1987. Since then, long-distance automatic and semi-automatic dialing has been realized among the 8 counties and cities along the western coast of the island. At the same time, it can be connected to the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and other countries and regions through the Haikou-Guangzhou microwave circuit.

The number of programmed control telephones has increased. Since the establishment of the province, 7,000 new lines have been added in Haikou, Sanya, and Tongshan, allowing users to dial directly to major cities across the country and dozens of countries or regions around the world that are connected to China. This year, the province plans to add another 10,000 programmed control telephone lines.

The Port Industry

The initial phase of the Yangpu Port project is taking shape. Construction began in January 1987 as a key project for the country's Seventh Five-Year Plan. It is planned to build two 20,000-ton berths and one 3,000-ton berth, with an annual handling capacity of 10 million tons and a total investment of 150 million yuan. Currently, one 10,000-ton bulk cargo wharf has been put into temporary operation, the foundations for the three berths have been completed, and the auxiliary facilities such as the communication building, machine repair station, and substation have been completed. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of 1990.

The wave-breaking wall reconstruction project at the Bashan Port is progressing rapidly. So far, nearly 400 meters of the 600-meter western wave-breaking wall relocation project have been completed, with nearly 70,000 cubic meters of underwater foundation stones laid, and 62% of various prefabricated components completed. This project is a key project for the country's Seventh Five-Year Plan, aiming to expand two 20,000-ton berths, increasing the annual handling capacity by 10 million tons. Construction began in 1987 and is planned to be completed next year.

The main body of the Qinglan Port expansion project has been completed recently. Construction began in June 1987 to build one 5,000-ton berth and two 500-ton berths, with an annual handling capacity of 5 million tons. The onshore auxiliary facilities such as water supply, drainage, power supply systems, and comprehensive buildings have also been completed.

The throughput of Haikou Port has surged after expansion. Previously, Haikou Port only had small berths with a capacity of less than 1,000 tons, with an annual throughput of 11.5 million tons. In 1986, two 5,000-ton berths were expanded, increasing the annual throughput by 5.5 million tons. Subsequently, the Ministry of Communications and the Hainan Provincial Government decided to expand two 10,000-ton general-purpose berths at the Xiuying Port in Haikou. After the completion of the deep-water port, the throughput capacity will increase by more than 80 million tons.

The Aviation Industry

The new terminal building of Haikou Airport has been put into use. This grand building, with a construction area of over 5,300 square meters, is a courtyard-style, multi-functional terminal. It was put into use in January this year. The terminal is mainly composed of a domestic terminal and an international terminal, as well as a duty-free shop and restaurants. It is equipped with central air conditioning, first-class electronic scales, and flight information electronic displays in China.

Haikou has added 10 new air routes. The Haikou Airport, built in 1956, had only two routes: Haikou to Zhanjiang and Haikou to Guangzhou by 1984. After 1985, especially after Hainan became a province and an economic special zone in April 1988, Haikou Airport has successively opened routes to Hong Kong, Beijing, Chengdu, Kunming, Shanghai, Sanya, Shenyang, and international routes to Singapore, Bangkok, Xi'an, and Hong Kong charter flights. There are about 10 flights daily. Thus, Hainan has closely connected with the five major economic cooperation zones in Northeast, North, Northwest, Southwest, and Central South China, as well as Southeast Asia.

The land acquisition work for the Phoenix International Civil Airport in Sanya has been completed. This airport, with an advanced international standard, covers a total area of 4,000 mu, with a runway length of 4 kilometers and a width of 3.4 kilometers, and a total investment of 200 million yuan, mainly funded by foreign investment. The airport is planned to be built in phases according to the principle of one-time planning and phased construction. The near-term construction will meet the standards for Boeing 737 aircraft, and the far-term construction will meet the standards for MD-82 and Boeing 767 aircraft. Construction is planned to begin this year and be completed by 1991. Currently, the land acquisition work has been completed, and the preliminary work is progressing smoothly.

The Highway Industry

The East Ring Expressway connecting Haikou and Sanya at the north and south ends of the island has a design speed of 100 kilometers per hour. Currently, the first phase of the project is progressing smoothly, with 50% of the earthwork for the roadbed completed. The highway is 272.18 kilometers long, shortening the distance from Haikou to Sanya by 49 kilometers compared to the Haipu East Line. In the near term, an investment of 938 million yuan will be made to build a 12-meter-wide half-width expressway. In the far term, an investment of 11.9 billion yuan will be made to expand it into a four-lane full-width expressway. Among them, 257.057 kilometers will be fully enclosed and fully interchanged, with an average driving speed of 100 kilometers per hour.

A well-developed road network. Basically, all towns have access to highways. At the beginning of the founding of the country, Hainan had only 1,047 kilometers of paved roads, which has now increased to 12,800 kilometers, including 1,400 kilometers of first-class and secondary highways and 152 kilometers of second-class highways. The main trunk lines in the east, west, and center of the island have been widened to 12 meters, with lanes marked for vehicles, significantly improving driving conditions.
