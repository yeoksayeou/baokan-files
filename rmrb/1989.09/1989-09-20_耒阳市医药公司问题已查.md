On September 24, 1988, your newspaper's fifth edition published a letter from a reader titled "The Trickery Behind Reporting Damaged Medicinal Materials." This year, on May 31, your newspaper's sixth edition published another article by your reporter titled "The Unsatisfactory Handling." To uphold discipline, we have decided on the following measures:

1. The funds for the fake thick bark and fake caterpillar fungus must be fully recovered.

2. Administrative warnings and a one-time fine of 50 yuan will be given to the direct supervisor responsible for purchasing the fake thick bark, Comrade He Xiaofu. A one-time fine of 50 yuan will be imposed on the person responsible for the business operations, Comrade Zhou Jin'an. Comrade Bu Yiman, who bears some leadership responsibility, will be required to submit a written self-criticism to the higher authorities. The Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company will be instructed to severely handle the individuals directly involved in purchasing the fake thick bark and returning part of it to the warehouse.

3. In accordance with the relevant regulations of the Hengyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company will establish a cleaning team to thoroughly address the issue of company leaders building private homes.
