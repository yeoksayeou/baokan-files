On September 7th, the 23 countries of the Warsaw Pact and NATO began their third round of negotiations in Vienna to reduce conventional armed forces in Europe. After nearly two years of preparatory talks and two rounds of formal negotiations from March to July this year, the strategies and plans of the two blocs have become clear. The current negotiations have entered the stage of bargaining. Overall, up to now, the negotiations have made greater progress than generally expected. Not only have six areas of reduction—tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, aircraft, helicopters, and personnel—been determined, but an agreement has also been reached on the total limits for tanks and armored vehicles. However, there are still many important differences between the two sides. The differences can be summarized into the following six major pending issues:

	— Reserved Weapons. NATO opposes the Warsaw Pact's inclusion of 5,800 tanks and artillery pieces and armored vehicles pre-positioned in Europe by the United States, Britain, and other countries within the limits. Among these tanks are approximately 4,000 U.S. reserve tanks. This is essentially a strategic issue caused by geographical factors. Significantly reducing reserve tanks would directly weaken the United States' ability to rapidly reinforce the European battlefield, thereby undermining the effectiveness of NATO's "flexible response strategy." NATO will not easily concede on this point.

	— National Limits. The Warsaw Pact proposes a national limit of 14,000 tanks, accounting for approximately 70% of each side's total; 18,000 armored vehicles, accounting for approximately 64% of each side's total. NATO, on the other hand, proposes a national limit of 12,000 tanks and 16,800 armored vehicles, accounting for approximately 60% of each side's total. Whether in terms of quantity or quality, the Soviet Union's share in the Warsaw Pact exceeds that of the United States in NATO. For the Warsaw Pact, increasing the national limit means increasing the military strength of the bloc, which is a crucial goal.

	— Types of Aircraft. The Warsaw Pact believes that the purpose of the negotiations is to eliminate the capability for surprise attacks and large-scale offensives and that a large number of its air defense aircraft should not be included in the calculations. NATO, however, believes that the uses of such aircraft are difficult to strictly distinguish. Britain and France, to maintain their independent nuclear capabilities, firmly oppose including "nuclear-use" aircraft within the scope of the negotiations.

	— Personnel Limits. NATO proposes a limit of 275,000 troops for U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe. The Warsaw Pact proposes a limit of 350,000 ground troops stationed outside their own territory. On the surface, the difference is 75,000, but the Warsaw Pact's proposal does not include several tens of thousands of Soviet air forces in Eastern Europe, making the actual difference more than 100,000. More importantly, NATO's proposal does not include tens of thousands of British, French, and other troops stationed in West Germany, which the Warsaw Pact considers extremely unfair.

	— Regional Division. NATO proposes to extend the original "mutual and balanced force reductions" negotiations in Central Europe to cover the area from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, dividing it into four zones. The Warsaw Pact originally proposed dividing it into three zones: central, front, and rear. Later, it proposed dividing it into four zones: central, south, north, and rear. The central zone in both of the Warsaw Pact's proposals is larger than the one proposed by NATO. NATO's battle zone is geographically narrow, requiring a "forward defense" deployment. Expanding the central zone, which is the focus of arms restrictions, is clearly disadvantageous to NATO.

	— On-Site Inspection. NATO insists that all reduced troops should be demobilized and all reduced weapons should be destroyed, but neither side has proposed a specific plan for implementing the large and complex inspection work. It is clear that reaching an agreement in the short term will not be easy.

Currently, both sides' intentions to accelerate the negotiation process are consistent. On the Warsaw Pact side, the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries have announced unilateral reductions and accepted the principle of "asymmetrical reductions." From the numbers published by both sides, the Warsaw Pact has more heavy weapons than NATO. Accepting NATO's proposal of 20,000 tanks per side would mean that the Warsaw Pact's reductions would be 16 times those of NATO. The Warsaw Pact's concessions were made without obtaining a positive response from NATO, fully reflecting its determination to push the negotiations forward. On the NATO side, its recent summit unanimously adopted U.S. President Bush's proposal to speed up the negotiation process. This proposal calls for reaching an agreement within 6 to 12 months, effectively accepting the Warsaw Pact's demand to include aircraft, helicopters, and personnel in the negotiations, changing NATO's passive stance, and bringing the two sides' positions closer. It can be predicted that in the third round of negotiations, the two sides' proposals will further converge. Looking ahead, if no major setbacks occur that affect the negotiation process, reaching an agreement within about a year is possible.

    欧洲常规武装力量谈判：悬案和前景
    胡豫闽
    本月7日，华约、北约23个国家在维也纳就裁减欧洲常规武装力量开始进行第3轮谈判。经过近两年的准备性会谈和今年3月至7月的两轮正式谈判，两大集团的策略和方案基本展现。目前的谈判已进入讨价还价阶段。总的看，截至目前，谈判取得了比普遍预期要大的进展，不仅确定了坦克、火炮、装甲车、飞机、直升机、兵员六个裁减范围，而且在坦克和装甲车的总限额上达成了一致，但双方仍有不少重要分歧。双方的分歧可归纳为以下6大悬案：
    ——储备武器。北约反对华约将美英等国预存在欧洲前线的5800辆坦克及大炮和装甲车列入限额。上述坦克有美国的储备坦克约4000辆。这实际上是个由地理因素引起的战略问题，大幅度削减储备坦克将直接削弱美国快速增援欧洲战场的能力，从而损害北约“灵活反应战略”的有效性，北约不会轻易让步。
    ——每国限额。华约建议每国限额坦克为1.4万辆，约占每方总额70％；装甲车1.8万辆，约占每方总额64％。北约则建议每国限额坦克为1.2万辆、装甲车16800辆，约占每方总额的60％。无论数量或质量，苏军在华约中的比重均超出美军在北约中的比重。对华约来说，提高每国限额即提高集团军事实力，是必争的目标。
    ——飞机种类。华约认为谈判的目的是消除突袭和大规模进攻能力，不应将其大量防空飞机计算在内。北约则认为此类飞机用途很难严格区分。英法为维护其独立核力量，坚决反对将“核用途”飞机列入谈判范围。
    ——兵员限额。北约提出美苏驻欧军队限额27.5万。华约提出驻本国领土外地面部队限额35万。从表面计算，两者相差7.5万，但华约建议未含苏联驻东欧的几万空军部队，实际相差10多万。更重要的是，北约建议不提英法等国驻西德的十几万军队，华约认为这是极不公平的。
    ——区域划分。北约建议以原中欧“共同均衡裁军”谈判的7国为中心向外延伸，在大西洋至乌拉尔山脉以西地域划分为4个区。华约原建议分为中心、前方、后方3个区，后又提出可分为中心、南、北、后方4个区，两次建议的中心区范围均大于北约所提，北约战区地理狭窄，要求实施“前沿防御”部署，扩大军备限制重点的中心区显然对其不利。
    ——现场核查。北约坚持所有裁减的部队应予复员，所有裁减的武器应予销毁，但如何实施大量繁杂的核查工作，双方均未提出具体方案。可见，短期内达成协议并非易举。
    目前看来，双方要求加速谈判进程的意向并行不悖。在华约方面，苏联和一些东欧国家已宣布实施单方面裁军，并接受了大幅度
  “不对等裁减”的原则。从双方公布的数字看，华约不少重武器数量超过了北约，仅接受北约每方限额坦克2万辆的建议，就意味着其削减的坦克将为北约削减的16倍。华约上述让步是在未得到北约保证作出积极响应的情况下作出的，充分反映了其努力推动谈判的决心。在北约方面，不久前其首脑会议一致通过了美国总统布什关于加快谈判进度的建议。该建议呼吁在6至12个月内达成一项协议，实际上接受了华约将飞机、直升机和兵员纳入谈判范围的要求，改变了北约在谈判中的被动态势，双方的立场由此大为接近。可以预料，在第3轮谈判中，双方的提案将近一步靠拢。从发展看，如果不出现影响谈判进程的大波折，在一年左右达成协议是有可能的。
