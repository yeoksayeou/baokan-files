High-speed roads are the product of highly developed modern transportation, as well as the development of the automobile industry and overall industrial technology to a certain stage. Although they have the advantages of high throughput and high vehicle speeds, the practice of industrialized countries around the world has proven that the development of high-speed roads is not something that can be achieved overnight.

Currently, more than 50 economically developed countries around the world have built 130,000 kilometers of high-speed roads, with the United States accounting for nearly 70%. High-speed roads are expensive to build, costing 80 to 100 million yuan per kilometer, and require a strong national economy to support. When the United States developed high-speed roads, its per capita national income was 2,000 dollars, while China's current per capita national income is around 300 dollars. Clearly, developing high-speed roads too early is beyond China's current national strength.

From the perspective of per capita arable land, developing high-speed roads in China is not cost-effective. A high-speed road with a traffic volume of 8,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day requires an average of 100 mu of land per kilometer; for a traffic volume of more than 12,000 vehicles, it requires 120 mu. In contrast, a newly built railway requires an average of 50 mu per kilometer for a single track and 70 mu for a double track, while upgrading an existing single track to a double track requires 20 mu per kilometer. High-speed roads require more than twice the land area of railways. The transportation capacity of a high-speed road is 22 million tons per year, while the railway between Beijing and Tianjin in 1987 carried 131 million tons. High-speed roads are mostly built in industrialized and densely populated areas. In China's coastal industrial zones, the per capita arable land is only 1.33 mu, making land extremely valuable. Building high-speed roads in such areas prematurely will inevitably affect grain and other crop yields.

Additionally, from the perspective of energy consumption, the power source for high-speed road transportation is oil, while railways can use coal, electricity, and oil. Moreover, high-speed roads consume a large amount of oil, about 10 times that of railways. China's oil reserves are 70 billion tons, but the per capita reserves are very low, making it an oil-poor country. From the perspective of rational energy use, it is also not advisable to develop high-speed roads too early.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that developing high-speed roads in China at this stage is not very realistic.

We should fully leverage the advantages of railways, which require less investment, have lower costs, consume less energy, have high capacity, are suitable for long distances, and are safe and reliable. With limited investment, we can generate greater transportation capacity and promote economic development. There is no need to rush into developing high-speed roads until we have sufficient national strength.

### 慎重发展高速公路

　　慎重发展高速公路
　　铁道部规划院　宋爱珍
    高速公路是现代化运输高度发展，以及汽车工业和整个工业科技发展到一定阶段的产物。虽然具有通过能力大、行车速度高等优点，但世界工业发达国家的实践证明，高速公路的发展是不可能一蹴而就的。
    目前，全世界已有50多个经济较发达的国家建成了13万公里的高速公路，其中美国占近70％。高速公路造价高，每公里需800——1000万元人民币，必须有强大的国力支持。美国发展高速公路时，人均国民收入2000美元，而我国目前的人均国民收入300美元左右。显然，过早发展高速公路，是我国现有国力所达不到的。
    从人均耕地面积看，我国发展高速公路得不偿失。一条行车量8000——10000辆的高速公路，平均每公里占地100亩；行车量在12000辆以上，占地120亩。而新建铁路占地单线平均每公里50亩，复线70亩，既有线修建复线每公里20亩。高速公路是铁路占地的2倍多。高速公路的运输能力为每年2200万换算吨，而铁路1987年北京至天津间，承担了13100万换算吨的工作量。修建高速公路大都在工业发达、人口稠密的地区，我国东南沿海工业区人均可耕地只有1.33亩，寸土寸金，在这样的地方“超前”修建高速公路必然影响粮食及其他农作物产量。
    另外，从能耗情况看，高速公路运输的动力来源只能用油，铁路可用煤、电、油。而且高速公路的耗油量大，是铁路的10倍左右。我国的石油储量700亿吨，但人均储量却很低，属于贫油国家。从合理使用能源的角度看，也不宜过早发展高速公路。
    仅从以上的分析可看出，现阶段我国发展高速公路是不大现实的。
    应充分发挥铁路投资省、成本低、能耗少、运量大、长距离、安全可靠的优势，用有限的投资，产生更大的运输能力，促进经济发展，直到有足够的国力，再发展高速公路也不迟。
