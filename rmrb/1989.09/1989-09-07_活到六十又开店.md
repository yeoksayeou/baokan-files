40 years have passed, and I have walked with the Republic through 14,600 days and nights. There is so much to say.

I was born in 1921, the same year as the Chinese Communist Party. In 1937, when the Japanese invaded, the Kuomintang fled, and I lost all respect for them. From that moment, I believed that the Communist Party was the savior of China, and I started working with the democratic government.

When the People's Republic of China was established, my heart burned with excitement: for generations, we had been oppressed, but now we could stand tall! I borrowed 100 yuan in Hebei's Laiyuan County to open a small general store. Young and strong, I had boundless energy. After finishing my own work, I would help the county's Federation of Industry and Commerce with their tasks, often working until the early hours of the morning. In 1954, I opened an inn. At that time, I was full of ambition: I dug a well alone in three days and built 12 rooms in a month, attracting travelers from all directions. The inn thrived, catching the attention of the county, who then appointed me to manage the county's hotel. I trusted the Party, and although I was not a member, I was willing to follow its lead. I became the manager for the state. In the first year, I won two first-place awards in the regional evaluation. In 1963, during the economic adjustment, I responded to the Party's call and voluntarily returned to the countryside to farm, opening an inn for the production team. Our generation has experienced so many wars, famines, and epidemics. Finally, we have encountered a peaceful and prosperous era. No matter how difficult it is, building a socialist motherland is a task we undertake with all our might.

Unfortunately, a few years later, the Cultural Revolution began. At first, I listened to the radio and read the newspapers, discovering that many of the old leaders from the revolutionary base areas had been overthrown, which made me uncomfortable. Later, I was also not spared; I was labeled a "new rich peasant" and paraded through the streets with drums and trumpets. At that time, there was a new directive every day and a new slogan every day, which really confused me. Although I was confused, I knew I was innocent and that as long as our country was still the People's Republic and led by the Communist Party, these issues would eventually be resolved.

Since the Gang of Four was smashed, my heart has been at ease again. In 1979, I was rehabilitated, and the state's policies gradually aligned with the people's wishes. I started thinking about opening a business again.

The first time I opened a business, I was 30 years old. This time, I am 60. I borrowed 100 yuan from my family and rented two dilapidated mud-brick rooms to open a restaurant. My family found out and was furious. I showed them newspapers from the central government and the province, saying: The country is reforming and opening up, there are policies, so why should we be afraid? If we do well, we can also contribute to the country!

I knew the country was moving forward, but I didn't expect the next ten years to progress so quickly. I also didn't expect that, even in old age, I would have such great ambitions. By 1986, my restaurant had grown from a 15-square-meter mud hut to a small building, becoming the largest individual catering business in the county. I will never forget the kindness of the Party and the state; every month, I am the first to pay my business taxes to the county. The county awarded me the title of tax model and appointed me as the chairman of the county's individual laborers' association. Last year, I was honored to join the Chinese Communist Party.

The Republic has walked with me for 40 years. I have grown old, but the Republic is becoming younger and younger; the Republic is becoming younger and younger, and I don't feel old. Really, the fate of the Republic is my fate. I have worked for it, rejoiced for it, and worried for it. But no matter what, now it's like sesame blossoming—both the Republic and I are getting stronger every day!

    活到六十又开店
    河北省涞水县　邢洲
    40年了，我和共和国一起走过14600来个日日夜夜。说起来，不知有多少话哩。
    我1921年出生，和中国共产党同岁。1937年，日本鬼子打来，国民党撒开腿就跑了，惹得我打心眼里瞧不起他们。打那时起，我认准共产党是中国的救星，就跟着民主政府干工作。
    中华人民共和国成立那阵，我心里总像有团火：多少辈子受人欺，今儿个直着腰杆做人了！我在河北涞水借了一百元钱开了间杂货铺。年青力壮，一股子使不完的劲，忙完了自己的事还帮着县里工商联做点工作，一忙就是三更半夜。1954年我又开上了车马店。那时我心气高，3天独自挖一口井，一个月盖起12间店房，引来了南来北往的行路人。店办得红红火火，引起了县里的注意，他们干脆抽我去管县里的旅馆。我信服党，虽不是党员，可愿意听党的，就去给公家当经理了。头一年，就在全地区评比中拿了两个第一。1963年经济调整，我又响应党的号召，主动回乡务农，为生产队开办车马店。我们这辈子人经了这么多的战乱、灾荒、瘟疫，好不容易遇到太平盛世，不管怎么有苦有难，建设社会主义祖国还是满身的劲。
    可惜不几年闹开了“文革”。开头是听广播，看报纸，发现过去根据地那些老首长被打倒不少，心里挺别扭。后来连我也没能逃过去，给戴上“新生富农”的帽子，打鼓吹号地拥去游行。那时候今天一个文件，明天一个口号，真把我闹懵了。懵是懵，我可知道自己冤枉，也知道只要咱们国家还叫人民共和国，还是共产党领导，这些事总有一天会搞清楚的。
    自打粉碎了“四人帮”，我心里又滋润了起来。1979年给我平反了，国家政策一步步随着老百姓的心思变，我又动起了开店的心思。
    第一次开店我30岁，这次已经60岁了。我背着家人借来一百元钱，租了两间挺胸凹肚的土坯房，开起了饭店。家里知道了，和我闹翻了天。我拿来中央和省里的报纸说：国家改革开放了，有政策，咱还怕什么？咱干好了也好对国家做个贡献！
    我知道国家要大步前进了，可没想到这十年会走得这么快，也没想到老了，老了，又像当年一样有个大抱负。到1986年，我的饭店从15平方米的土坯窝发展成一座小楼，成了县里最大的饮食业个体户。我忘不了党和国家的恩情，每个月总是第一个把工商税交到县里。县里给我评上了个纳税模范，还让我担任了县个体劳动者协会主任。去年，我光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    共和国伴着我走了40年。我老了，共和国却越来越年轻；共和国越来越年轻，我也不觉得老了。真的，共和国的命运也就是我的命运。我为她干，为她乐，也为她愁过，但不管怎么说，如今好比芝麻开花，共和国与我可是一天比一天强啦！
