Open Administration and Accept Supervision

    **Xing'an County—Hiring Supervisors**

    **Shahe City—Setting Up Bulletin Boards**

    The office of the Xing'an County government in Hebei Province, Huai Ping, Xi Zhen, and An Hai wrote: To enhance the transparency of administrative work, our county has adopted measures such as publicizing conditions, quotas, and results in areas like the recruitment of officials, factory hiring, converting temporary workers to full-time contract workers, and the regularization of private school teachers. This approach accepts public supervision. Over the past year, the county has recruited 6 officials, converted 324 temporary workers to full-time contract workers, hired 50 full-time contract workers, and regularized 24 private school teachers. No cases of favoritism, backdoor deals, or falsification were found.

    To strengthen the supervision of administrative work by various sectors of society, the county procuratorate, supervision bureau, and price bureau have established complaint centers, set up 6 complaint hotlines, and placed 18 supervision boxes in local streets and townships. A group of officials with good conduct, strong party spirit, and a willingness to uphold principles, including party representatives, people's congress representatives, retired cadres, workers, and farmer representatives, have been appointed as corruption supervision officers. So far, the county has received 387 letters and petitions, with 206 cases accepted by relevant departments and 56 cases investigated and processed.

    **Research Office of the Hebei Provincial Supervision Bureau, Liang Guo Ping, and Xu Li Hai wrote:** In August last year, the Shahe City government in Hebei Province established a government affairs public bulletin board, publicly disclosing matters of concern to the public such as recruitment, official appointments, agricultural to non-agricultural conversions, and official promotions, as well as the drafting, implementation methods, and results of major policy decisions. By the end of May this year, the city had established 490 government affairs public bulletin boards, disclosing 90 items and 1,580 periods of government affairs. The city government's functional departments, township governments, street offices, and factories and enterprises have all set up government affairs public bulletin boards. The city government has also invited legal consultants from the judicial department and supervisors from the planning commission, finance bureau, audit bureau, and industrial and commercial bureau to leverage the supervisory role of state functional agencies.

    After the government implemented the open administration, those who engage in deception had no opportunity to do so. There were no instances of misappropriation, deduction, or withholding of important production materials within the plan.

　　办事公开　接受监督
　　成安县——聘请监督员
    沙河市——设立公布栏
    河北成安县政府办公室怀平　希珍　安海来信：为了增强政务工作的透明度，我县在干部招聘、工厂招工、临时工改为全民合同工及民办教师转正等方面，采取了公开条件、公开指标、公开结果的办法，接受群众监督。去年以来，全县共招聘干部6人，临时工改全民合同工324人，招收全民合同工50人，民办教师转正24人，未发现走后门、递条子、弄虚作假等现象。
    为了加强社会各界对政务工作的监督，县检察院、监察局、物价局等部门相继成立举报中心，设立举报电话6部，并在基层街道、乡镇设了18个监督箱。一批作风正、党性强，敢于坚持原则的党代表、人大代表、离退休干部职工和农民代表担任廉政监督员。到目前为止，全县共收到各类举报信件和上访案件387件，有关部门受理案件206件，已立案查处的56件。
    河北省监察厅研究室梁国平　徐立海来信：去年8月，河北沙河市政府建立了政务公开栏，将群众关心的招工、招干、农转非、干部任免等情况和一些重大事项的决策草拟、执行方法、执行结果公布在上边。到今年5月底，全市已建立政务公开栏490多个，公布政务90多项、1580多期。市政府各职能部门及乡镇政府、街道办事处和厂矿企业，都设了政务公开栏。市政府还从司法部门请来法律顾问，从计委、财政局、审计局、工商局聘来监督员，发挥国家职能机关的监督作用。
    政府实行政务公开后，一些弄虚作假者无机可乘，计划内重要生产资料的分配、调拨，也没有发生挪用、克扣、截留现象。
