Flowers bloom between heaven and earth.
The balconies of tall buildings have turned red.
The balconies of tall buildings have turned yellow.
The balconies of tall buildings are red and yellow.
The balconies of tall buildings are fragrant.
The balconies of tall buildings are intoxicated.
The balconies of tall buildings are piled high with laughter.
Tall buildings are colorful tall buildings.
Tall buildings are fragrant tall buildings.
Tall buildings are tall buildings full of vitality.
Tall buildings are tall buildings filled with deep emotions.
The balconies of tall buildings are very proud,
Having more sunlight than any other room.
The balconies of tall buildings are very open,
Not rejecting the visits of wind and rain.

    花在天地之间开放
    再耕
    高楼的阳台红了
    高楼的阳台黄了
    高楼的阳台红红黄黄了
    高楼的阳台香了
    高楼的阳台醉了
    高楼的阳台堆满笑了
    高楼是彩色的高楼
    高楼是芬芳的高楼
    高楼是生命力旺盛的高楼
    高楼是感情浓烈的高楼
    高楼的阳台非常自豪
    比任何房间都有更充足的阳光
    高楼的阳台非常开放
    不拒绝风雨来访的旅游
