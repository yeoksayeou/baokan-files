The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) was originally named the "Inter-Parliamentary Union for the Promotion of International Arbitration." It was initiated by parliamentarians from Britain, France, and six other countries and was established on June 29, 1889, in Paris, France. In 1922, it adopted a new constitution and changed its name to the current one. The headquarters has been successively located in Bern, Brussels, and Oslo, and since 1921, it has been based in Geneva. Currently, it has 112 member countries.

The IPU aims to improve the effectiveness of representative democracy through extensive contact between parliamentarians of member countries, and to promote international peace and cooperation.

The IPU consists of an Assembly, a Governing Council, an Executive Committee, and a Secretariat. The Governing Council is composed of two parliamentarians appointed by each member country. The Executive Committee is composed of 13 members elected from the Governing Council, with the Chairman of the Governing Council also serving as the Chairman of the Executive Committee. The current Chairman of the Governing Council is Daouda Sow from Senegal. Each member country of the IPU has 8 voting rights, with additional votes allocated based on the country's population. China's delegation to the National People's Congress has 23 voting rights.

After China resumed its seat in the United Nations General Assembly, the IPU leadership proactively contacted China regarding its membership in the IPU. On

    各国议会联盟
    各国议会联盟原名“促进国际仲裁的各国议会联盟”，由英国、法国等9国议员发起，于1889年6月29日在法国巴黎成立。1922年通过新章程改现名。总部先后设在伯尔尼、布鲁塞尔、奥斯陆，从1921年起设于日内瓦。现有成员国112个。
    各国议会联盟的宗旨是通过各成员国议员间的广泛接触，改进代议制的效能，促进国际和平与合作。
    各国议会联盟设有大会、理事会、执委会和秘书处。理事会由各成员国选派两名议员组成，执委会由理事会中选出的13名成员组成、理事会主席兼任执委会主席。现任理事会主席是塞内加尔的达乌达·索。“联盟”每个成员国有8票表决权，另外可再按国家的人口增加票数，我国人大代表团可有23票表决权。
    在我国恢复在联大席位之后，各国议会联盟负责人主动同我联系加入议会联盟事宜。1983年12月8日，我六届人大第三次常委会通过中国加入“各国议会联盟”的决议。1984年4月2日，各国议会联盟接纳中国全国人民代表大会为其成员国。我国已故的人大常委会委员宦乡还曾当选为各国议会联盟执委会委员。
