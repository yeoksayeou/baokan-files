2,790 representatives attending the National Labor Model Commendation Conference began arriving in Beijing today. The capital, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, welcomes the elite from all fronts across the country with a new look.

Colorful lanterns, red lanterns, and eye-catching banners... The ten places where the labor models will stay, including the Guoyi Hotel, Jingyan Hotel, Xinjiang Office in Beijing, and the Chemical Industry Department Guesthouse, have all been decorated beautifully.

The Beijing Municipal Government has given strong support to the conference. It has made supply plans for the grains, oils, meats, eggs, and other foodstuffs as well as daily necessities needed by the conference venues, and has arranged for dedicated points, dedicated warehouses, and dedicated personnel to supply goods 24 hours a day. It has also dispatched personnel to inspect the water, electricity, communication, and gas lines and equipment at each venue, and has arranged service points for clothing repairs and other services.

At the 10 accommodation sites for the representatives, the Ministry of Health has arranged medical teams from nearby hospitals to handle medical services, and has equipped ambulances. The Beijing Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Department has also dispatched personnel to oversee food hygiene and epidemic prevention at each site.

The hotels and guesthouses responsible for receiving the representatives have made thorough preparations. Leaders from the Organization Department of the Central Committee, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, and the People's Liberation Army have all visited the accommodation sites to make mobilizations and specific arrangements. The Public Security Guesthouse has also conducted over a month of training for its service staff; since the accommodation sites will generally adopt a system of individual meals, the service staff have all received new training.
