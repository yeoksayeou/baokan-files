A book with a purple-gray plastic laminated cover lies before him. The title is particularly eye-catching: *Tears Weigh Heavier Than Water*. At this moment, describing the author's mood, who has a head full of silver hair, as tumultuous is quite fitting.

Ten years ago, Li Zhenyu, who had just entered his forties, stepped down from his position as deputy corps commander. Li Zhenyu, still retaining the old habits from his many years in the military, arranged his new life after retirement in a manner that was both tense and orderly. He would wake up early to exercise, listen to news broadcasts, systematically read some famous literary works from China and abroad, do some housework, or read some literary books, recall and organize his own experiences... Although life had a bit of a bitter taste, it was very fulfilling.

He read a large number of works and made more than ten thousand words of literary notes, excerpting the essence of classics and recording his own feelings. After these preparations, he began to practice writing short stories.

He thought carefully, wrote meticulously, and revised repeatedly. Finally, a piece was completed, but he dared not send it out. He continued to write, one piece after another. When he felt that they had some meaning, he finally mustered the courage to send them out. The thick rejection letters came one after another. At this moment, he truly tasted the bitterness of this difficult path.

Could he do it? He pondered: Even if he couldn't, he had to try! Moving forward, though difficult, still held hope. "Victory and defeat are common in military affairs," he thought. It didn't matter. If he fell, he would get back up, wipe the sweat, replenish some "supplies," and continue to charge forward.

He paid to enroll in a literature creation lecture held by the Chaoyang District Cultural Center in Beijing. He sought guidance from famous teachers and humbly learned from his younger "classmates."

His hard work finally bore fruit. In February 1984, Li Zhenyu's debut short story was published in a municipal magazine. Subsequently, several of his novels were gradually printed. He was indescribably happy. After multiple failures, he finally won several consecutive battles. This was a comfort for his pain, a reward for his labor, and also a new starting point.

Starting from November 1984, his creation entered a new turning point, beginning to conceive and write his first long novel, *Tears Weigh Heavier Than Water*. This novel, through the ups and downs of two families, reflects a side of contemporary society. Although the number of characters is not many, the story is touching and natural.

To create this long novel, he entered a state of "first-level readiness." Day after day of writing, night after night of plotting, sometimes he would write all day, just turn off the light and lie in bed, suddenly think of a plot, and then get up to quickly record it. After 10 months of arduous struggle, a draft of over 300,000 words was completed. He sought opinions from various sources and revised it for five more months. When he held the sample book in his hands, his eyes moistened. Finally, he had a significant achievement.

After completing *Tears Weigh Heavier Than Water*, Li Zhenyu did not stop. He immediately began writing his second long novel, *Courtyard Romance*, which is 250,000 words long and has been decided for publication by a publisher. Soon, he began writing his third long novel, *Military Marriage*. He charges forward in his creation with the posture of a soldier. He said: "I write novels, neither for fame nor for money. I do it to lash out against evil and sing the praises of justice. My pen belongs to the people and will forever serve the people, until the end of my life."

    新的追求
    ——记部队离休干部李振玉
    王灵书
    一本紫灰色塑料压膜封面的长篇小说摆在他面前。书名分外夺目：《泪比水重》。此刻，用心潮翻滚来形容满头银发的作者的心情，十分合适。
    十年前，刚刚步入不惑之年的李振玉从副师长岗位上退了下来。李振玉还是多年部队生活养成的老习惯，将退下来后的新生活安排得那么紧紧张张又有条不紊。早起锻炼，听新闻广播，系统地阅读一些中外文学名著，做做家务，或看点文学书籍，回忆和整理自己的经历……生活虽然带点苦味，但很充实。
    他阅读了大量的作品，作了十多万字的文学笔记，摘抄名著的精华，记下自己的感受。在经过了这些准备之后，他开始练习创作短篇小说。
    认真构思，刻意描写，反复修改，一篇终于出来了，但他不敢寄出去。他还是写，一篇，又一篇，自己觉得有点意思了，终于鼓起勇气寄了出去。鼓鼓囊囊的退稿信，一封又一封。此刻，他是真正尝到这艰难的滋味了。
    自己能行吗？他暗暗自忖：不行也得行！往前走，虽很艰难，但仍有希望。“胜败乃兵家常事”，不要紧，跌倒了，爬起来，擦擦汗，补充点“给养”，继续朝前冲。
    他自费报名参加了北京朝阳区文化馆举办文学创作讲座。他请名师指点，他不耻下问地向比他年轻的“同学”们学习。
    辛勤的劳作终于有了收获。1984年2月，李振玉的短篇处女作在一家市级刊物上发表了。随后，他的几篇小说逐渐印成铅字。他心中说不出的高兴，在多次失败之后终于连续打了几个胜仗，这是对他痛苦的安慰，是对他劳动的奖赏，也是一次新的起点。
    从1984年11月起，他的创作进入了一个新的转折点，开始构思写作第一部长篇小说《泪比水重》。这部小说通过两家人的坎坷悲欢，反映了现实社会的一个侧面。人物虽不多，但故事委婉动人，真切自然。
    为创作这部长篇他进入了“一级战备”。一天天的写作，一夜夜的构思，有时他写了一天，刚刚拉灭灯躺在床上，突然又想起一个情节，便又起床赶紧记下来。经过10个月的艰苦奋战，一部30多万字的初稿出手了。他多方征求意见，先后修改了五个月。样书拿到手他眼眶湿润了，终于有了一次可观的收获。
    完成《泪比水重》后，李振玉又马不停蹄地开始了第二部长篇小说的创作，25万字的
  《庭院风流》出版社决定出版。不久，他又开始写第三部长篇小说《军婚》了。他以军人的姿态在创作中冲锋。他说：“我写小说，一不为名，二不为钱，我是为了鞭笞丑恶，讴歌正义，我的笔属于人民，永远服务于人民，直到自己的生命终止。”
