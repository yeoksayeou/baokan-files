Nepal's Former Prime Minister Praises China's Achievements

KATHMANDU, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his visit to China, former Nepalese Prime Minister Kirtinidhi Bista said on Sept. 2 that the Chinese people have achieved remarkable successes, especially since Deng Xiaoping's advocacy of modernization and reform in various fields.

He said that China's achievements in the economic and other fields are extraordinary. These achievements have not only been recognized by the Chinese people but also by the world.

He noted, "I have seen significant differences in the living standards of the people from 1965 to 1987." China has changed its own face, and the people are living in a prosperous and happy country.

He also observed that China has encountered some difficulties and shortcomings in the process of modernization and reform. However, he believes that China will quickly overcome these difficulties and achieve satisfactory results.

He said that in international affairs, China plays a constructive and extremely important role in maintaining peace and easing tensions. As a close neighbor of China, we believe that China will become a prosperous and powerful country in the near future.

He said that China can help Nepal in many areas, including agriculture and small and medium-sized industries. "China understands Nepal's difficult situation, and we hope to receive China's sympathy and support."
