Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 24th.

Recently, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan held a meeting in Guangzhou to discuss the "clean-up" campaign with leaders from Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces. After the meeting, the four provinces have been diligently implementing the meeting's spirit, with the main leaders of the provincial committees personally overseeing and ensuring the implementation of the campaign, resulting in significant progress.

Fujian Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi, Zhejiang Provincial Committee Secretary Li Zemin, Guangdong Provincial Committee Secretary Lin Ruo, and Hainan Provincial Committee Secretary Xu Shijie each presided over meetings attended by provincial committee and government officials. They listened to reports from the Guangzhou "clean-up" work meeting and made arrangements to block the sources of pornographic materials, shut down obscene publications and videotapes, and promote the in-depth development of the "clean-up" campaign. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee held its second province-wide "clean-up" telephone conference on September 15. The Guangdong Provincial Committee held a meeting from September 21 to 23 for officials from cities and key counties to discuss the "clean-up" work. Hainan Province adopted a "direct to the bottom" approach, holding a meeting for county-level and above leaders on September 23 to convey and deploy the campaign, deciding to combine the "clean-up" with the crackdown on prostitution and solicitation. The main leaders of these provinces all spoke at the meetings.

To block the sources of pornographic materials and eradicate the "black spots" that mass-produce and distribute obscene videotapes and publications, Fujian Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi and Deputy Secretary Jia Qinglin went to Shishi City on September 22 to inspect and guide the work. Zhejiang High People's Court President Yuan Fanglie led a working group to Wenzhou for specific guidance.

    据新华社北京9月24日电　中央政治局常委李瑞环最近在广州召开了有福建、浙江、广东、海南四省负责同志参加的“扫黄”工作座谈会后，四省认真贯彻会议精神，省委主要负责同志亲自动手，狠抓落实，使“扫黄”工作有了新的进展。
    福建省委书记陈光毅、浙江省委书记李泽民、广东省委书记林若、海南省委书记许士杰同志分别主持省委、省政府负责同志参加的会议，听取了广州“扫黄”工作座谈会的汇报，并就堵“黄源”，取缔淫秽书报刊和录相带，推动“扫黄”工作深入，作出了部署。浙江省委于9月15日召开了全省第二次“扫黄”电话会议。广东省委于21日至23日召开了各地市和重点县负责同志参加的“扫黄”工作会议。海南省采取“一竿子插到底”的作法，于23日召开了县以上主要领导干部大会，进行传达和部署，确定把“扫黄”同打击嫖娼卖淫结合起来。这些省的主要负责同志都分别在会上讲了话。
    为了堵住“黄源”，拔掉那些大量走私、翻制淫秽录相和书刊的“黑据点”，福建省委书记陈光毅、副书记贾庆林已于9月22日赶赴问题严重的石狮市检查指导，浙江省高级人民法院院长袁芳烈带领工作组，到温州地区进行具体指导。
