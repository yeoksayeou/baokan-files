Over the past decade of reform and opening up, the cultural industry in Liaoning has yielded abundant fruits.

In 1979, the play "Reporting Flowers" created and performed by the Liaoning People's Art Theatre won the first prize for both creation and performance in the National Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1984, the play "Wreaths on the High Mountain," adapted from the novel of the same name by Liaoning Art Theatre, won multiple awards, including the first prize for the script and the first prize for performance in the National Drama Festival.

The large-scale Manchu mythological dance drama "Pearl Lake" by the Liaoning Song and Dance Troupe has gained fame both domestically and internationally. Songs created by Liaoning lyricists and composers, such as "The Communist Party is Good, The Communist Party is Kind" and "The Full Moon on the Fifteenth," have been widely popular across the country.

The television drama "Snowy Fields," produced by the Liaoning Television Drama Production Center, and "Nurhaci," co-produced by the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Television Drama Production Center, both won the first prize for serial dramas in the 1987 National Television "Feitian" Awards. The color television transmission tower built in Shenyang stands at 305.5 meters, ranking 6th in the world and 2nd in Asia. It can simultaneously transmit 6 television and 6 FM radio programs.
