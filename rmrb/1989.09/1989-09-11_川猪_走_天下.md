	Rich Meat Supply Base
	One can say without exaggeration that now, except for Taiwan, pork from Sichuan can be found throughout the country. In recent years, Sichuan has produced over 300 million tons of pork annually, which is more than 20 times the amount in 1949. In 1987, the number of pigs in Sichuan reached 57 million, accounting for 1/6 of the national total, and the number of pigs slaughtered accounted for 1/5 of the national total. Inter-provincial allocation and export accounted for 1/3 of the national total. Therefore, the fluctuations in Sichuan's pig production have a significant impact on the entire country.

	People remember that in the second half of 1987, the national pork supply was tight, and 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions sought help from Sichuan. Sichuan promptly allocated 330,000 tons of pork, easing the urgent situation.

	It is understood that since 1986, Sichuan has supplied more than 500,000 tons of fresh and frozen pork and various cured meats such as sausages and bacon to various provinces and cities across the country through various channels each year, equivalent to more than 10 million pigs.

	The pigs in Sichuan are fed with relatively good feed and are slaughtered at the right time, so they generally have more lean meat and tender meat. Shanghai calls Sichuan pigs "lean pigs," while Beijing and Tianjin simply call them "lean meat pigs." To meet market demand, Sichuan has further improved pig breeds in recent years and vigorously developed commercial lean meat pig bases. By this year, the province (including the central government) has invested more than 30 million yuan in 70 counties to establish lean meat pig production points. Last year, the base counties slaughtered 19.75 million lean meat pigs, accounting for 35% of the total number of pigs slaughtered in the province.

	Continuous Stable Development for 13 Years
	Relevant officials told the reporter that since 1977, Sichuan's pig production has been continuously and stably developed, increasing by 4-8% each year.

	Why has Sichuan's pig production been able to develop rapidly and continuously? The main reason is that the leadership pays attention to it, the policies are stable, and the enthusiasm of millions of farmers to raise pigs is high.

	In the past, Sichuan's pig production developed slowly for a long time. During the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, the vast majority of farmers were not well-fed, so they could not raise pigs on a large scale. In the spring of 1976, Sichuan's rural areas suffered from spring famine, and the "Land of Abundance" had to import more than 500 million kilograms of corn from other provinces as staple food. That year, the province's pig slaughtering only reached more than 20 million.

	After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, Sichuan was one of the first to implement the household responsibility system, and grain production increased rapidly, and the pig industry also developed rapidly. To mobilize and protect farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government took the development of the pig industry as a major task. Provincial, municipal, and county governments all have dedicated personnel to handle the matter and formulate various specific policies and measures to encourage the development of pig raising. At the same time, various places have included the development of the pig industry in the cadre target responsibility system as a basis for evaluating cadres' performance. Some counties even link the salaries and bonuses of district, township, and village cadres to the development of pig production, signing responsibility letters for the development of pig production, with rewards for exceeding targets and penalties for falling short. Under the encouragement of the Party and the government, farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs has reached an unprecedented level, and a large number of pig-raising specialists like Liu Dingguo, the "King of Pig Raising" in An County, and Chen Daohuai, the "Champion of Pig Raising" in Renshou County, have emerged. At the same time, Sichuan has formulated a set of stable pig-raising policies, and whether pork is in short supply or "overflowing in storage," it does not easily change.

	Unique Breeding Conditions
	The reason why Sichuan's pig production has high output and good quality is also due to its unique breeding conditions.

	Firstly, Sichuan's rural areas are vast, with more than 22 million households, and every household has the habit of raising pigs. In the past, there was a folk saying in rural areas: "Black-haired pigs, every family has them." Sichuan's township enterprises are not as developed as those in coastal provinces and cities, and there are not many industrial and sideline channels. For ordinary families, raising pigs may not be very profitable, but it is similar to a bank's "savings account," and can also produce a large amount of high-quality organic fertilizer. Therefore, many farmers, although not very willing to raise pigs, still have to raise them. Raising pigs has always been a major sideline for farmers. Currently, the average number of pigs raised per household in rural areas is 2.6. Sichuan has a large number of rural households, and if the benefits of purchasing and selling are slightly adjusted, and at the same time, strengthen pre-production, in-production, and post-production services, further mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, the potential is still great.

	Secondly, Sichuan has a mild climate and evergreen seasons, and there is more pig feed. Sichuan produces nearly 100 million tons of alcohol annually, with 1.4 billion kilograms of alcohol dregs, which provides a large amount of high-quality feed for the development of the pig industry. According to relevant departments, raising a large pig in northern rural areas requires 200-300 kilograms of grain and about 10 months; while in Sichuan, only about 150 kilograms of grain is needed, and it can be slaughtered in half a year, or 7-8 months at the slowest. Therefore, in recent years, to encourage farmers to raise pigs, Shanghai stipulates that farmers can be rewarded with 200 kilograms of subsidized feed grain for every pig sold, Tianjin 150 kilograms, Beijing more than 100 kilograms, while Sichuan only 35 kilograms. For the country, developing pig raising in Sichuan is the most cost-effective. In addition, the temperature in the north is low, and pigs themselves consume more, and they are generally fat when slaughtered; while in the south, the temperature is high, pigs grow faster, and naturally, there is more lean meat, which is more in line with consumers' needs.

	In recent years, Sichuan has vigorously promoted pig-raising technology transformation, promoted crossbred pigs, changed single feed to compound feed, changed cooked food to raw food, and slaughtered pigs at the right time, not raising them to be too fat. This not only improves the quality of pork but also increases production and economic benefits. After comprehensive technological transformation, the production cost of each pig can be reduced by about 30 yuan on average.

	Preventing the Decline of Sichuan Pigs
	This is not an alarmist statement.

	Currently, Sichuan's pig production is stable. However, there are various problems that hinder the development of Sichuan pigs hidden beneath the good situation. If these problems are not addressed in a timely manner, it is inevitable that Sichuan pigs will decline, affecting the national market supply and foreign trade exports. One issue worth noting is that in recent years, the price of pig feed has remained high, causing the pig-grain price ratio to drop significantly, which has dampened farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, and some places have already seen a decline in pig production. Taking corn, the main feed for pigs, as an example, the price was 0.72 yuan per kilogram last year, and it has risen to 0.9 yuan this year. Currently, the national average pig-grain price ratio is 1:5.5, while in Sichuan it is 1:3.2, the lowest in the country.

	In addition, there are serious issues of unfair distribution in pig production and sales. Farmers raising pigs for a year do not earn as much as individual butchers selling meat for a day. Some brother provinces and cities have forgotten that Sichuan, the "wine and meat friend," helped them in critical moments. Some emphasize their own "overflowing storage" this year, delay the allocation plan, and transfer difficulties; others allocate meat but do not pay for it, giving Sichuan "blank checks." According to statistics, by the end of June this year, a few major cities alone owe Sichuan 180 million yuan for pork. Sichuan's relevant departments have no choice but to similarly owe the lower levels, and ultimately, the producers, the farmers, are the ones who suffer, anxiously holding more than 70 million yuan in "blank checks." To protect farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, Sichuan's governments at all levels are taking various measures to solve the problems, and at the same time, they also hope that brother provinces and cities will extend a helping hand to help Sichuan overcome the difficulties.

    川猪“走”天下
　　本报记者　罗茂城
              丰富的肉食基地
    可以毫不夸张地说，现在全国除台湾以外，都能吃到四川的猪肉。近几年四川每年生产猪肉300多万吨，相当于1949年的20多倍。1987年生猪存栏数达5700万头，占全国的1／6，出栏数占1／5，省际间的调拨及外贸出口占全国的1／3。因此，四川生猪的起伏，对全国有着举足轻重的影响。
    人们记得，1987年下半年，全国生猪供应全面紧张，有26个省、市、自治区向四川求援。四川及时调出33万吨猪肉，解了燃眉之急。
    据了解，1986年以来，四川每年通过各种渠道，供应全国各省市鲜冻猪肉和香肠、腊肉等各种腌腊制品达50万吨以上，相当于1000多万头猪。
    四川生猪喂的饲料较好，宰杀适时，因此，一般都瘦肉多，肉质鲜嫩。上海称川猪为小膘猪，北京、天津则直呼瘦肉猪。为适应市场需要，四川近几年来进一步改良猪种，大力发展商品瘦肉型生猪基地。截至今年，全省（包括中央）已投入3000多万元，在70个县建立瘦肉型猪生产点。去年基地县出栏瘦肉猪1975万头，占全省出栏肉猪总数的35％。
            连续13年稳定发展
      有关负责同志告诉记者，从1977年算起，四川生猪已连续13年稳定发展，每年以4—8％的幅度递增。
      为什么四川生猪能迅速持续发展呢？主要原因是领导重视，政策稳定，千百万农民养猪的积极性高涨。
      过去四川生猪长期发展缓慢。在“文革”动乱期间，广大农民尚不得温饱，当然无法大规模养猪。1976年春，四川农村闹春荒，“天府之国”不得不从外省调进5亿多公斤玉米当口粮。那年全省生猪出栏才2000多万头。
      党的十一届三中全会以后，四川较早地实行包产到户，粮食产量直线上升，养猪事业也随之迅速发展。为调动和保护农民养猪的积极性，四川省委、省政府把发展养猪事业当作一件大事来抓。省、地、县各级政府都有专人负责，并制定各种鼓励发展养猪的具体政策和措施。同时，各地把发展养猪事业纳入干部目标管理责任制，作为考核干部政绩的依据。有的县还同区、乡、村干部的工资和奖金挂钩，签订发展生猪生产的责任书，超奖减罚。广大农民在党和政府的鼓励下，养猪热情空前高涨，涌现出大批像安县“养猪大王”刘定国、仁寿县“养猪状元”陈道怀那样的养猪专业大户。同时，四川还制定了一整套稳定的养猪政策，不管是猪肉紧俏还是猪肉“胀库”，从不轻易变更。
        得天独厚的饲养条件
    四川生猪所以能产量高，肉质好，还有一个重要原因，就是有得天独厚的饲养条件。
    首先，四川农村广阔，有2200多万农户，家家户户向来有养猪的习惯。旧时农村就有“黑毛猪，家家有”的俚谚。四川乡镇工业不像沿海省、市那样发达，工副业门路不多。对一般家庭来说，养猪虽然微利，但类似银行“零存整取”的储蓄，还可积造大量优质有机肥料。因此，许多农民虽然不那么愿意养，但又不得不养。养猪一直是农家的一项主要副业。目前，农村每户平均养猪2.6头。四川农户基数大，如果购销利益稍加调整，同时加强产前、产中、产后服务，进一步调动农民养猪积极性，潜力仍然很大。
    其次，四川气候温和，四季长青，猪饲料较多。四川每年产酒近百万吨，酒糟14亿公斤，这为发展养猪事业提供了大量优质饲料。据有关部门测算，北方农村养大一头猪，需花原粮200—300公斤，时间要10个月左右；而四川只需原粮150公斤左右，快的半年，慢的七八个月就可出栏。因此，近几年为鼓励农民养猪，上海规定农民每交售一头肥猪，奖售平价饲料粮200公斤，天津150公斤，北京100多公斤，而四川只35公斤。对国家来说，在四川发展养猪是最合算的。此外，北方气温低，生猪本身消耗大，出栏时一般膘厚；而南方气温高，猪长得快，自然瘦肉多，更符合消费者需要。
      近几年来，四川大抓生猪饲养技术改造，推广杂交猪，改单一饲料为配合饲料，改熟食为生食，并且适时宰杀，不养大肥猪，既改进了猪肉的质量，又提高了产量和经济效益。经综合技术改造，平均每头猪可降低生产成本约30元。
          谨防川猪滑坡
    这不是危言耸听。
      目前川猪生产是稳定的。但是，在好的形势下面，也隐藏着种种有碍川猪发展的问题。如不注意及时解决，难免会造成川猪滑坡，从而影响全国的市场供应和外贸出口。其中一个值得注意的问题是，近年来生猪饲料价格一直居高不下，造成猪粮比价大幅度下降，使农民养猪的积极性受到挫伤，个别地方已出现生猪滑坡的现象。以生猪的主要饲料玉米为例，去年每公斤0.72元，今年涨到0.9元。目前全国平均猪粮比价为1∶5.5，而四川是1∶3.2，在全国最低。
      此外，在生猪生产与销售上，存在着严重的分配不公。农民养猪一年，不如个体屠户卖肉一天。再是有的兄弟省市淡忘了在关键时刻帮过大忙的四川这个“酒肉朋友”。有的强调自己今年“胀库”，延缓调拨计划，转嫁困难；有的则调了肉不给钱，给四川“打白条”。据统计，到今年6月底，仅几个大城市就欠四川1.8亿元肉钱。四川有关部门没法，只好同样欠着下面，最终吃亏的是生产者，农民拿着7000多万元的“白条”干着急。为了保护农民养猪积极性，四川省各级政府正在采取各种措施解决问题，同时也希望各兄弟省市伸出援助之手，帮助四川渡过难关。
