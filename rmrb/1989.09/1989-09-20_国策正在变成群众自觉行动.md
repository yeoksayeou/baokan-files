The implementation of family planning in China is often referred to as the "first difficult task," especially in rural areas. Facing backward economic and cultural conditions, deeply rooted traditional views on childbearing, and the chaotic behaviors that emerged during the initial stages of reform and opening up, many well-intentioned individuals have expressed concerns about China's population control. This is understandable. However, what is even more evident is that the entire nation is making concerted efforts, undertaking immense work with great difficulty. The national policy is gradually becoming a voluntary action of the masses, and there is hope...

Dragon Victory: 160,000-Person County Reduces Population by 25,000 in 10 Years
Located in the rugged mountains of Guangxi, Dragon Victory is a multi-ethnic autonomous county where 28% of the population resides at altitudes above 1,000 meters. The county has 119 administrative villages, but fewer than half have roads accessible by car, making it one of the key poverty-stricken counties designated by the State Council. Before 1974, the natural population growth rate in the county was consistently above 20 per thousand.

Should population control and family planning be implemented here? County-level cadres and the masses calculated the costs from various angles, including per capita paddy fields and grain production, education, and healthcare expenditures. Miao cadre Yang Ruicheng told his fellow Miao people, "Family planning is true; Miao children must remember, if you only focus on having more children, your descendants will have to fight over mud." The honest and sincere people of various ethnic groups here, who have a deep trust in the Party and the government, have a tradition of valuing both sons and daughters equally, with sons settling in the wife's home and supporting the in-laws. Most of them can voluntarily accept family planning arrangements. After the county government incorporated the population plan into the national economic development plan, it established a team of politically reliable and professionally competent family planning workers who consistently focus on the task. Every township and village committee is equipped with family planning assistants and full-time cadres, ensuring that every village has a family planning management station, forming a network of workers. From 1979 to 1988, the county's birth rate decreased from 19.49 per thousand to 12.92 per thousand, the natural growth rate from 11.97 per thousand to 5.91 per thousand, and the multiple birth rate from 23% to 0.48%. In 10 years, this impoverished county of 160,000 people, with 75% of the population being ethnic minorities, reduced its population by 25,000.

Mian County: No Unplanned Births for 7 Years
Located in the western part of the Han River Basin, Shaanxi's Mian County has a population of 399,000. Since 1980, the county has implemented the national family planning policy, adhering to the principle of "differentiated treatment and classified guidance." In the plain areas, which account for 70% of the population but only 21% of the land, the emphasis is on promoting the idea of "one couple, one child," while allowing a planned second child for couples with special difficulties. In the hilly areas, which account for 25% of the population and 31% of the land, the conditions for allowing a second child are slightly relaxed. In the deep mountain areas, which account for only 5% of the population but 46% of the land and are economically and culturally backward, the policy is to allow a planned second child, except for cases of mental retardation, consanguinity, and hereditary diseases, based on the principles of considering actual difficulties and promoting healthy births. Because the policy and methods are practical and reasonable, the masses understand and welcome them. Since 1979, the county's birth rate has been controlled below 14.2 per thousand, and the natural growth rate below 8 per thousand. There have been no unplanned births for 7 consecutive years, and the total population has only increased by 10,000 in 10 years. Moreover, since 1980, the quality of the population has significantly improved. For example, in Changhegou Township, 7% of the current population has intellectual disabilities, but there are no cases among children under 5 years old.

Rudong: Population Increased by Only 8.56% in 20 Years, Income Increased by 10 Times
Historically, Jiangsu's Rudong has been in a cycle of poverty. Since 1970, the county committee and the county government have worked together to control population growth and economic production, firmly implementing family planning and vigorously developing the economy, thus effectively controlling the population growth rate.

The natural growth rate decreased from around 25 per thousand in the 1960s to 4 per thousand in the 1970s and around 3 per thousand in the early 1980s. Even in recent years, when the birth rate was high, the natural growth rate was controlled at around 8 per thousand.

The significant reduction in the population growth rate has brought about obvious economic and social benefits. Over the 20 years of implementing family planning, the county has cumulatively reduced the population by approximately 400,000, equivalent to 35.84% of the current total population. In 1988, compared to 1970, the population increased by only 8.56%, while the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 469 million yuan to 22.09 billion yuan. Per capita national income increased from 202 yuan to 1,328 yuan, and per capita income for the agricultural population increased from 73 yuan to 709 yuan.

Nangong: Masses Self-Govern to Implement National Policy
The city of Nangong (formerly Nangong County) in Hebei Province, with a population of over 400,000, began establishing family planning associations at various levels in 1983. The city formed a network of family planning management that is self-educating and self-serving, with childbearing-age couples as the main body and family planning activists as the backbone, including old party members, old cadres, old models, old elders, and retired state cadres. The associations operate under the law, working deeply among the people to change outdated marriage and childbearing views, help single-child families escape poverty and become prosperous, and jointly build socialist spiritual civilization. The development of mass family planning work has changed the previous passive situation where a few people worked for the majority, creating a new situation where the majority help the minority resolve ideological knots. It has mobilized the entire society to participate in family planning management, achieving a combination of state guidance and mass voluntarism, strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and promoting stability and unity. In the past five or six years, the city's family planning rate has been maintained above 94%, the natural growth rate controlled at around 6 per thousand, and the multiple birth rate reduced to below 0.5%.

Even in the two years of 1986 and 1987, when the population birth rate was high, the natural growth rate was still controlled at 6.67 per thousand and 7.4 per thousand, respectively.

　　国策正在变成群众自觉行动
　　雷剑玲
    人称在中国搞计划生育是“第一难”，尤其难在农村。面对落后的经济和文化、执著的传统生育观以及开放搞活之初畸生的各类无政府行为，不少仁人志士对中国的人口控制深感忧虑。这自然有其道理。但更加显而易见的是，举国上下都在努力，千辛万苦地做了大量工作，国策正在变成普通群众的自觉行动，人们看到了希望……
    龙胜，16万人小县10年少生2.5万人
    地处丛山峻岭的广西龙胜是个多民族自治县，28％的人口居住在海拔1000米以上的高山上。全县119个行政村，有公路可乘车到达的不足一半，是国务院重点扶贫县之一。1974年以前，全县人口自然增长率都在千分之二十以上。
    这里要不要控制人口、搞计划生育？县里各级干部和群众从人均水田和粮食产量、教育及卫生经费花销等多方面一起算了细账。苗族干部杨瑞清对他的同胞说：“计划生育讲得真，苗家儿女要记清，如果只顾多生仔，后代吃泥也要争。”这里诚实憨厚、对党和政府无限信赖的各族群众，素有生男生女都一样、男到女家落户并赡养岳父母的传统美德，大都能够自觉地接受计划生育安排。县政府把全县的人口计划纳入国民经济发展计划后，即组建了一支政治素质高、业务能力强、常抓不懈的计划生育工作队伍。所有乡镇和村公所都配备了计生助理和专职干部，使村村都有计生管理站，形成了工作网络。自1979年至1988年，这个县人口出生率由千分之一十九点四九下降到千分之一十二点九二，自然增长率由千分之一十一点九七下降到千分之五点九一，多胎率由23％下降到0.48％。10年里，这个只有16万人、少数民族占75％的贫困小县少生了2.5万多人。
      勉县，7年无计划外生育
    陕西勉县位于汉中盆地西部，人口39.9万。从1980年起贯彻国家计划生育政策，坚持从实际出发，实行“区别对待、分类指导”原则。在占全县人口70％、土地只占21％的平川区，以普遍提倡“一对夫妇只生一个孩子”为主，有计划地安排部分有特殊困难的夫妇生育第二胎；在占全县人口25％、占土地31％的浅山丘陵区，对允许生育二胎的条件适当放宽；在只占全县人口5％、土地却占46％、经济文化落后的深山区，本着照顾实际困难和优生优育原则，规定除痴呆、近亲及遗传病患者外，有计划地安排生育二胎。由于政策和方法符合实际，入情入理，群众十分理解和欢迎。1979年以来这个县的人口出生率一直控制在千分之一十四点二以下，人口自然增长率控制在千分之八以下。已经连续7年没有计划外生育了，10年里全县总人口只增了1万人。而且，1980年以后出生的人口素质明显提高，如长河沟乡智力低下患者占现有人口的7％，而5岁以下儿童已无一例发病。
    如东，20年人口只增8.56％，
    收入却增10倍
    历史上一直处在贫困圈里的江苏如东，1970年开始，县委、县政府就通力尽职尽责把住人口和经济生产协调发展关，一手坚持抓计划生育、一手大力发展经济，使人口增长速度得到了有效控制。
    自然增长率从60年代的千分之二十五左右下降到70年代的千分之四和80年代初的千分之三左右。即使进入生育高峰的近几年，人口自然增长率也被控制在千分之八左右。
    人口增长速度的锐减带来了明显的经济效益和社会效益。实行计划生育20年来全县累计少生约40万人，相当于现有人口总量的35.84％。1988年与1970年比，人口只增加了8.56％，而工农业总产值却由4.69亿元增加到22.09亿元。人均国民收入由202元增加到1328元，农业人口人均收入由73元增加到709元。南宫，群众依法自治落实国策
    40几万人口的河北南宫市（原南宫县），1983年开始成立各层次的民间计划生育协会。全市从下到上形成了以育龄夫妇为主体，以计划生育积极分子为骨干，有老党员、老干部、老模范、老长辈和离退休的国家干部参加的，群众自我教育和自我服务的计划生育管理网络。协会依法自治，从改变旧婚育观、帮助独生子女家庭脱贫致富、共建社会主义精神文明等方面深入群众，做切实工作。群众性计划生育工作的开展，改变了这个市过去少数人给多数人做工作的被动局面，出现了多数人给少数人解思想疙瘩的新形势，调动了全社会的力量参与计划生育管理，实现了国家指导和群众自愿相结合，密切了党群关系，促进了安定团结。近五六年来，这个市的计划生育率都保持在94％以上，人口自然增长率都控制在千分之六左右，多胎率已下降到0.5％以下。
    就是在1986和1987年两个人口生育高峰年里，人口自然增长率仍分别控制在千分之六点六七和千分之七点四。
