The popular reference book "Cihai" has undergone five years of revision and supplementation and is now presented to readers in a new form on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Jiang Zemin personally inscribed a congratulatory message: "Carry forward the spirit of 'Cihai,' which is meticulous, precise, and rigorous, and strive to improve the cultural quality of the Chinese people!"

The 1979 edition of "Cihai" has been in print for a decade and has been a bestseller, with over 400 million copies of the three-volume abridged edition and over 100 million copies of various individual volumes, setting a new record for the circulation of large-scale dictionaries. Due to the rapid changes in domestic and international situations and scientific and technological advancements, some of the information, data, and viewpoints in the 1979 edition of "Cihai" have become outdated. Therefore, the editorial board of "Cihai" and the Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House decided to begin revising the dictionary in 1984.

The 1989 edition of "Cihai" has undergone a comprehensive adjustment and supplementation of its subject system, with over 140 first-level subjects; for some entries that were incorrectly interpreted due to political reasons such as the Cultural Revolution, a realistic correction has been made; the new edition has added a batch of entries reflecting the new developments and achievements in politics, economy, science, and culture in the 1980s, replacing old information and data with the latest. The book's entries have been adjusted by 25%, and some errors in the 1979 edition have been corrected. After the revision, the new edition of "Cihai" contains 120,000 entries, an increase of 18,000 from the 1979 edition, with a total of 16 million words, an increase of 2.6 million words. The added content is equivalent to a large specialized dictionary. Cao Feng, the president of the Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House, told the reporter that they have signed a cooperation agreement with the Eastern Book Company in Taiwan for the publication of the new edition of "Cihai" in three volumes and various individual volumes.
