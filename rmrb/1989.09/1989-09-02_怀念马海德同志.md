Every time we think of the great internationalist Norman Bethune, we are filled with deep respect and nostalgia. Norman Bethune—this foreigner who dedicated his life to China—struggled on Chinese soil for 55 years. Although he has left us, his great achievements and noble character will forever remain in the hearts of the Chinese people.

Comrade Norman Bethune was the first foreign doctor to join the Red Army for battlefield medical work. During the war-torn years, he overcame countless difficulties to procure medicines and equipment for the liberated areas. Under extremely harsh conditions, he provided medical care for many high-ranking leaders of our Party and Army, including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Wang Jiaxiang, and treated countless soldiers and civilians. To save critically ill patients, he often donated his own blood without hesitation and performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. During the period of socialist construction, he participated in and led the work of eradicating venereal diseases and leprosy, making outstanding contributions. At the same time, he trained tens of thousands of medical workers for the healthcare sector. With his high medical ethics, superb medical skills, and rigorous scientific attitude, he won the trust of the Chinese people. For decades, he tirelessly promoted China's great achievements and policies abroad, making outstanding contributions to expanding the international influence of socialist China.

Before liberation, Comrade Norman Bethune successively served as a consultant for the Military Commission's Health Department, the Central Foreign Affairs Group, and Xinhua News Agency. After liberation, he served as a consultant for the Ministry of Health for a long time and was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Whatever work he undertook, he did so with full enthusiasm and dedication, achieving outstanding results in every position. In 1988, the Ministry of Health awarded him the honorary title of "Pioneer of New China's Healthcare Industry" to commend his outstanding contributions to the liberation and construction of the Chinese people over more than half a century. Internationally, he received multiple awards, bringing honor to our country.

Comrade Norman Bethune is indeed a great internationalist, a loyal proletarian revolutionary, and an outstanding medical expert.

In the summer of 1936, Comrade Norman Bethune arrived in Baoding, Shaanxi, with Mr. Edgar Snow. By the end of that year, the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had successfully united. Afterward, we gradually got to know him and began working together. At that time, the Chinese revolution was in its most difficult and perilous period. Due to the Kuomintang's frenzied "encirclement and suppression" and encroachment on the red base areas, and due to the interference of opportunistic lines within the Party, the Red Army suffered heavy losses. Some wavering elements lost faith in the revolution and even became despicable deserters. However, Norman Bethune, as a foreign medical expert, resolutely gave up his comfortable living conditions and risked his life to join the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The following year, he joined the Communist Party of China. From then on, his life became inseparable from the Chinese revolution, and he steadfastly walked the rugged and winding path of life, dedicating everything to the Chinese people.

As a young man, Norman Bethune harbored the ideal of practicing medicine to save lives and crossed the ocean to China. He wanted to study the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases in China and hoped to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people through his medical practice. However, in the bustling streets of Shanghai, he witnessed the heavy disasters brought by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the people. He saw the rottenness and incompetence of the Kuomintang government and deeply realized that relying solely on his medical skills could not save the millions of impoverished Chinese people struggling on the brink of death. Norman Bethune fell into deep thought: "The poor need not only pills but also a cure for the ills of society, a change in this unreasonable social system where people oppress people." How to change the situation in China? Norman Bethune felt at a loss. Just at this time, Louis Aylmer organized a study group in Shanghai to learn Marxism-Leninism. The appearance of this organization was like a beacon lighting the way forward. Norman Bethune began to eagerly study Marxist-Leninist theory and participated in the revolutionary activities of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai working class. From then on, his thoughts underwent a fundamental change. Norman Bethune saw hope in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which was undergoing a arduous Long March. He decided to join this revolutionary army and immediately put it into action. In Norman Bethune's mind, there were no national boundaries, no racial boundaries. For the happiness of 400 million Chinese people, he fearlessly embarked on a new life and walked this path to the end of his life. In his later years, Norman Bethune once humorously said, "If I were to start my life over, I would still choose this path. There is no doubt about it!" These words fully embody the lofty goals and firm revolutionary convictions of a proletarian revolutionary, reflecting Norman Bethune's noble character of enduring hardships for decades without complaint.

Over more than half a century of a long and tortuous journey, Comrade Norman Bethune endured the trials of gunfire and shelling during the war years and the struggles against the ultra-leftist line within the Party.

As a foreigner joining the Chinese revolution, the price Norman Bethune paid was incomparable to that of ordinary people. For a long time, Norman Bethune was repeatedly slandered by the likes of Kang Sheng, labeled as a "special suspect," and even accused of being a "foreign spy," suffering political discrimination and cold treatment, and being long-term "controlled" in his work. Norman Bethune never minded these things. His heart, which loved China and the Chinese people, remained unchanged, and his revolutionary enthusiasm remained unwavering. During the chaotic "Cultural Revolution," his body and mind were severely persecuted. At that time, some people tried to persuade him to "rebel," and others advised him to flee abroad, but Norman Bethune never considered these suggestions. Relying on his strong faith in the Party, he maintained revolutionary optimism and had full confidence in the future of China and his own future.

At that time, we two were also severely persecuted. Jiang Yizhen was imprisoned and suffered from a serious heart condition in 1972. In March of that year, he was sent to the Fuwai Hospital for "medical parole." At that time, Norman Bethune was also "sent down" to work as a dermatologist in the same hospital. Initially, there were guards at the door of Jiang Yizhen's ward, preventing him from contacting the outside world. Norman Bethune, out of concern and trust for his old comrade, often asked nurses to deliver foreign and domestic magazines and materials to Jiang Yizhen, helping him understand the changes in the situation. Seeing such precious materials, Jiang Yizhen, who had been isolated from the world for seven or eight years, was deeply moved and deeply touched by the understanding and trust among revolutionary comrades. In August, after the guards at the ward door were withdrawn, Norman Bethune immediately came to Jiang Yizhen's bedside. From then on, he visited every week. One day, Jiang Yizhen learned that Liu Shaoqi, Chen Yi, and Fu Lianzhang, and other old comrades had died one after another due to severe persecution. He was heartbroken and shed tears of grief when he saw Norman Bethune. Norman Bethune tried his best to comfort Jiang Yizhen, urging him to take care of his health. On that occasion, the two of them reminisced about the great achievements of these old comrades and expressed their confidence in the future of the Party.

At that time, Norman Bethune said with full confidence: "Our Party has made many mistakes before victory, the most serious time was when the Soviet area lost ninety percent, and the white area lost one hundred percent. But in the end, our Party overcame the wrong line and welcomed the liberation of the whole country. This time, although it has caused a heartbreaking loss, our Party will one day solve all problems and restore the country to the right track."

During the "Cultural Revolution," a medical expert who had returned from the United States was cold-shouldered in both life and work. She reported these problems to Comrade Norman Bethune. Norman Bethune, on the one hand, affirmed her patriotic enthusiasm, and on the other hand, comforted her, sincerely saying, "The chaos will soon pass, and the Party's policy towards intellectuals will also be adjusted. We should look further ahead." To solve her housing difficulties, Norman Bethune and his wife Sophie invited this expert to live in their home until three years later when the organization allocated her a house. Norman Bethune's consistent attitude of maintaining the Party's prestige and caring for comrades can be seen from this.

Not long after the "Gang of Four" was smashed, a series of wrongful cases within and outside the Party were gradually rectified, and Norman Bethune's "special suspect" case was also withdrawn in 1978. For decades, he treated these groundless suspicions with the most detached attitude, always firmly believing in the Party's policies, and showed the broad-mindedness and openness of an internationalist.

Soon after the "Gang of Four" was smashed, our country needed to send a comrade to work at the World Health Organization. We thought that Norman Bethune had received higher medical education in Geneva and obtained a doctorate, was proficient in foreign languages, and was skilled in diplomacy, making him the most suitable candidate. When we discussed this with him, he said without hesitation, "I can do some work in this area, but my expertise and interest are in the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases and leprosy." In recent years, many people have yearned to work abroad and struggled for it, but Norman Bethune unhesitatingly gave up this "plum position" and continued to work on the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases and leprosy, which some people discriminate against and many people try to avoid. In his broad chest, there was never a place for personal treatment and enjoyment.

In fact, since the founding of New China, Norman Bethune had already devoted all his energy to the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases. He carefully summarized the successful experiences of the Chinese medical community, actively absorbed advanced scientific and technological achievements from various countries, and under the support of the State Council and the Ministry of Health, correctly implemented the Party's policies, leading the broad masses of medical workers to jointly strive for the rapid eradication of venereal diseases, making important contributions.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Norman Bethune returned to the fight against leprosy, which had been forced to stop during the "Cultural Revolution." Due to social prejudice, people have a strong fear of leprosy, and leprosy patients are isolated and discriminated against everywhere. Norman Bethune deeply sympathized with them and said, "Leprosy patients are innocent victims." In 1981, Norman Bethune and his colleagues, after long-term investigation and research, scientifically proposed the new idea that "leprosy is preventable, curable, and not to be feared," and suggested that leprosy patients return to society and their families, allowing them to escape the pain of isolation from the world and enjoy family happiness again. His major reform in leprosy prevention work was not done recklessly but was a combination of emotion and science. In fact, the infectiousness of leprosy is very low, and in addition, Norman Bethune introduced a new technology for treating leprosy from abroad in 1980—the strong bactericidal combined drug therapy. With this treatment, patients can leave the infectious period within a week and be cured on average within two years.

With the strong support of the leaders of the Ministry of Health, through the unremitting efforts of Norman Bethune and his colleagues, it is expected that leprosy will be eradicated in China by the year 2000. After basically eradicating venereal diseases in China, Norman Bethune again made outstanding contributions to the eradication of leprosy, setting a brilliant example for the development of China's healthcare industry. However, Norman Bethune always attributed the achievements to the Party and the people.

Since arriving in China from the United States, Comrade Norman Bethune had already integrated himself into the liberation and construction of the Chinese people, dedicating his entire life to this cause. He is indeed a model of a great internationalist. In his later years, he devoted himself to the eradication of leprosy in China and achieved outstanding results, but this was not his only goal. He said, "After eradicating leprosy in China, we will send medical teams to Third World countries to eradicate leprosy in all countries around the world!" With a global vision, this is the true character of Norman Bethune—a great internationalist.

All foreign friends who have fought or are fighting for the liberation and construction of the Chinese people occupy an important position in Norman Bethune's heart. During the War of Resistance, he enthusiastically received Canadian Norman Bethune, Indian Kotewa, Basu, members of the Indian Medical Aid Team to China, and German Hans Muller. He always shared his personal experiences with them, making them deeply understand the Chinese anti-Japanese military and civilians, and helped them establish communication with their relatives abroad. After liberation, he continued to promote understanding and friendship between the peoples of various countries and China, as he did during the war years. He had extensive international exchanges. Whether he was visiting abroad, receiving foreign guests, or even in letters to foreigners, he enthusiastically promoted the policies and principles of the Communist Party of China, promoted the socialist system, making many foreigners better understand the situation in China, dispel some misunderstandings and prejudices about China, and continuously expand China's influence in the international arena.

In international exchanges, Comrade Norman Bethune was humble and sincere, showing the proper demeanor of a Chinese. He often educated his colleagues, saying, "We should not casually ask foreigners for money. We should use our policies, systems, and work spirit to move them, so that they will voluntarily provide us with assistance." In 1985, Norman Bethune took the opportunity of the first National Symposium on Leprosy held in Guangzhou to vigorously promote China's health policies and organized representatives of various countries' leprosy foundations to visit the Guangdong Provincial Leprosy Hospital, making them believe in the possibility of eradicating leprosy in China by the year 2000. Afterwards, the representatives of various foundations negotiated with the Chinese side, expressing their willingness to contribute to the eradication of leprosy in China.

In 1983, Basu, the chairman of the Indian Acupuncture Medical Committee, who had fought in China, encountered difficulties in his work and immediately wrote to Norman Bethune for advice. To help Basu solve these problems, Norman Bethune invited him to China through the China International Friendship Association. At the same time, he invited Jiang Yizhen and other comrades to discuss with Basu how to further promote acupuncture work in India. After more than three days of discussion, they found the root of the problem and studied the improvement plan, laying a good foundation for the development of the Indian Acupuncture Medical Committee. Later, Basu came to Beijing for treatment due to illness. Norman Bethune specially borrowed an Indian song cassette to play for him and, together with other comrades, invited Hu Yaobang to visit him in the hospital, giving Basu, who was ill, the greatest comfort. Comrade Norman Bethune was like this. When others were in trouble, he always extended a helping hand with enthusiasm, warming the hearts of those around him with his fiery passion. However, he never cared about personal gains and losses and never fought for fame and fortune. To illuminate others while burning oneself, this is the true image of Norman Bethune—a great internationalist.

    怀念马海德同志
    江一真　钱信忠
    每当想起伟大的国际主义战士马海德同志，我们对他的崇敬和怀念之情就油然而生。马海德——这个外国血统的中国人，在中国的土地上奋斗了整整55个春秋。他虽然已经离去，但他的伟大功绩和高尚的品格却永远留在中国人民的心中。
    马海德同志是第一个到红军中参加战地医疗工作的外国医生。他在硝烟弥漫的战争年代，克服重重困难，千方百计从国内外为解放区解决药品和器械的不足；在极其艰苦的条件下，曾为毛泽东、周恩来、王稼祥等许多我党我军的高级领导同志做过医疗保健工作，也曾为数以万计的广大军民疗病治伤。为了抢救垂危的患者，他经常毫不迟疑地献出自己的鲜血，经常亲自为病人施行口对口的人工呼吸；在我国社会主义建设时期，他参加并领导了消灭性病和麻风病的工作，做出了突出贡献。同时，也为卫生战线培养了成千上万的医务工作者。他以高尚的医德、精湛的医术和严谨的科学作风赢得了中国人民的信赖；几十年来，他不懈地向国外宣传我国的伟大成就和政策，为扩大社会主义中国的国际影响做出了卓越贡献。
    解放前，马海德同志先后担任过军委卫生部、中央外事组和新华通讯社等重要部门的顾问。解放后，他长期担任卫生部顾问，并被选为第七届全国政协常委。他不论从事哪项工作都满腔热情，全力以赴，在所有的工作岗位上都取得了突出的成绩。1988年9月，卫生部为表彰他半个多世纪以来为中国人民的解放事业和建设事业做出的优异贡献，授予他“新中国卫生事业的先驱”荣誉称号。在国际上，他先后多次获奖，为我国赢得了荣誉。
    马海德同志不愧为一个伟大的国际主义者、忠诚的无产阶级革命家和杰出的医学专家。（一）
    马海德同志1936年夏季同斯诺先生一起到达陕北的保安，同年秋末，中国工农红军一、二、四方面军胜利会师。此后，我们先后与他相识并开始在一起工作。当时，中国革命还处于历史上最艰苦、最危急的时期，由于国民党反动派对红色根据地的疯狂“围剿”和蚕食，更由于党内机会主义路线的干扰，红军受到了很大损失。有些不坚定分子对革命的前途失去信心，甚至当了可耻的逃兵。但是，身为外国医学专家的马海德却毅然放弃了优越的生活条件，冒着生命危险参加了中国工农红军，翌年加入了中国共产党。从此，他的一生便与中国革命结下了不解之缘，他坚定执著地走完了崎岖、坎坷的人生之路，为中国人民奉献了自己的一切。
    青年时代的马海德就怀着行医济世的理想远渡重洋，踏上了中国这块贫困土地。他一心想在中国研究热带病的防治，想通过行医为苦难深重的中国人民解除病痛。然而，在上海的十里洋场，他耳闻目睹的只是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义给人民带来的沉重灾难。他看清了国民党政府的腐朽和无能，痛切地认识到单靠自己的医技不可能拯救饥寒交迫、在死亡线上挣扎的千百万贫苦的中国人。马海德陷入了沉思：“穷人需要的不仅仅是药片，更需要的是医治社会的病症，改变这种人压迫人的不合理的社会制度。”如何才能改变中国的现状呢？马海德感到茫然。就在这个时候，路易·艾黎在上海组织了学习马列主义的小组。这个组织的出现犹如一盏明灯照亮了前面的道路，马海德开始如饥似渴地学习马列主义理论，并参加了中国共产党和上海工人阶级的革命活动，从此他的思想产生了突变。马海德从正在进行艰苦长征的中国工农红军中看到了中国的希望，他决心投入这支革命部队，并立即付之行动。在马海德心目中，没有国籍的界限，也没有种族的界限，为了四万万中国人民的幸福，他义无反顾地踏上了崭新的生活之途，并沿着这条路走到生命的终点。马海德同志在晚年曾风趣地说：“如果让我重新开始生活，我还是要选择这条路，这是毫无疑问的！”这番话充分体现了一个无产阶级革命家崇高的奋斗目标和坚定的革命信念，反映了马海德同志为这个信念历尽坎坷几十年无怨无悔的高尚品德。（二）
    在半个多世纪漫长而又曲折的道路上，马海德同志经受了战争年代枪林弹雨的考验，也经受了与党内极“左”路线斗争的考验。
    一个外国人投身于中国革命，付出的代价是一般人所不能比拟的。长期以来，马海德同志一直遭到康生之流的诬陷，被戴上“特嫌”的帽子，甚至被诬蔑为“外国间谍”，在政治上受到歧视和冷遇，在工作上长期被“控制使用”。对这些，马海德同志从来不放在心上，他那颗热爱中国、热爱中国人民的心却一如既往，他的革命热情始终不渝。在那乌云翻滚的“文革”期间，他的身心都受到了严重迫害。当时，有人曾动员他
  “起来造反”，也有人劝他出国避难，但马海德从未考虑过这些建议，凭借着对党的坚强信念，他一直保持着革命的乐观主义，对中国的前途和个人的前途充满信心。
    当时，我们两人也受到了严重的迫害，江一真同志被关进了监狱，1972年在狱中患了严重的心脏病。同年3月，他被送到阜外医院“保外就医”。那时，马海德同志也被“下放”到该医院当皮肤科大夫。开始，江一真同志的病房门口有卫兵看守，不能与外界接触。马海德出于对老战友的关怀和信任，经常委托护士为江一真送去中外画报和材料，帮助他了解时局的发展变化。见到如此珍贵的资料，与世隔绝了七八年的江一真激动不已，深深地被革命同志间的理解与信任所感动。8月份，病房门口的卫兵刚刚撤走，马海德就立即来到江一真的病床前，从那以后，每星期都来探望。有一天，江一真得知刘少奇、陈毅及傅连璋等老同志因受到严重摧残而相继去世的消息，悲痛万分，当他见到马海德时，痛心地流下了热泪。马海德竭力劝江一真同志节哀，劝他保重身体。那次，两个人共同追忆了这些老同志的丰功伟绩，也表达了各自对党的前途的信心。
    马海德当时曾满怀信心地说：“我们党在胜利前也犯过不少错误，最严重的时候苏区损失了百分之九十，白区损失了百分之百，但最终我们党还是战胜了错误路线，迎来了全国的解放。这一次虽然也造成了令人痛心的巨大损失，但我们党总有一天会解决一切问题，重新使国家走上正轨。”
      “文革”期间，有一位从美国回国工作的医学专家在生活和工作上均遭到冷遇，她把这些问题向马海德同志进行了反映。马海德一方面肯定她的爱国热情，一方面安慰她，诚恳地对她说：“混乱很快就会过去，党对知识分子的政策也会加以调整，我们要看得远一些。”为了解决她的住房困难，马海德和夫人苏菲还把这位专家请到自己家居住，直到三年后组织上为她分配了住房。马海德同志一贯维护党的威望，一贯关心同志的作风由此可见一斑。
    粉粹“四人帮”后不久，党内外一系列冤假错案陆续得到平反，马海德同志的“特嫌”专案也于1978年撤除了。几十年来，他以最超脱的态度对待这种无端的怀疑，一直对党的政策坚信不疑，表现了一个国际主义者坦荡和豁达的胸怀。
                        （三）
    粉碎“四人帮”以后，我国需要派遣一名同志到世界卫生组织工作，我们认为马海德早年在日内瓦受到过高等医学教育并获得过博士学位，他精通外语，长于外交，是最合适的人选。当我们与他谈起这个问题时，他不假思索地说：“这方面的工作我可以做一些，但我的专长和志趣是在性病和麻风病的防治上。”近些年，不少人向往出国工作，并为之奋斗，但马海德同志却毫不犹豫地放弃了这个“肥缺”，继续从事着受一些人歧视，不少人拚命想避开的工作。在他那博大的胸怀里，个人的待遇和享受从来就没有位置。
    实际上，从新中国一成立，马海德就已把全部心血倾注在性病的防治上了。他认真总结中国医务界的成功经验，同时积极吸取各国的先进科学技术，在国务院和卫生部的支持下，正确执行党的政策，带领广大医务工作者共同奋斗，在很短的时间里迅速扑灭了性病，做出了重要贡献。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，马海德又投入了“文革”中被迫停止的消灭麻风病的斗争。由于社会的偏见，人们对麻风病有一种极强的恐惧心理，麻风病人被隔离起来，处处受到歧视和冷遇。马海德深深地同情着他们，他说：“麻风病人是无罪的罪人。”1981年，马海德和他的同事们经过长期调查研究，科学地提出了“麻风病可防、可治、不可怕”的新见解，并提议让麻风病人回到社会、家庭中去，让他们脱离与世隔绝的痛苦，重享天伦之乐。他对麻防工作的这一重大改革并非蛮干，而是感情与科学的结合。事实上，麻风病传染性极低，再加上马海德在1980年就引进了国外治疗麻风病的新技术——强杀菌联合药疗，用这种疗法，病人一周内即可脱离传染期，平均二年即可治愈。
    在卫生部领导同志的大力支持下，经过马海德和他的同行们的不懈努力，2000年可望在中国消灭麻风病。继在中国基本消灭性病之后马海德又为消灭麻风病立下了汗马功劳，为发展中国的卫生事业树立了光辉的典范。但是马海德总是把取得的成绩归功于党和人民。
                        （四）
    马海德同志自从美国来到中国之日起，就已将自己融入了中国人民的解放事业和建设事业，并为此贡献了毕生的精力。他不愧是一个伟大的国际主义战士的典范。他晚年致力于在中国消灭麻风病，并取得了突出的成效，但这不是他的唯一目的，他说：“在中国消灭了麻风病之后，我们还要向第三世界国家派遣医疗队，让全世界所有的国家都消灭麻风病！”胸怀全球放眼世界，这正是马海德——一个国际主义者的本色。
    凡是为中国人民的解放事业及建设事业奋斗过或正在奋斗的外国朋友，在马海德心目中都占有重要的位置。抗战时期，他先后热情接待了加拿大的白求恩、印度的柯棣华、巴苏、印度援华医疗队的其他成员及德国的汉斯·米勒等。他总是以自己亲身经历娓娓相告，使他们对中国的抗日军民有深刻的了解，并帮助他们与国外的亲人建立通信联系。解放后，他仍像战争年代一样，继续为促进各国人民对中国的了解和友谊做出贡献。他有着广泛的国际交往，不论出国访问还是接待国外来客，甚至在与国外人士的书信中，他都热情地宣传中国共产党的政策和主张，宣传社会主义制度，使许多外国人更好地了解中国的情况，解除一些人对中国的误解与偏见，不断扩大中国在国际上的影响。
    在对外交往中，马海德同志谦逊诚恳，表现出一个中国人应有的不亢不卑的风度。他经常教育身边的工作人员说：“我们不要随便向外国人伸手要钱，应该用我们的政策、制度和工作精神去感动他们，让他们主动向我们提供援助。”1985年，马海德就利用在广州召开的中国第一届麻风病学术交流会的机会大力宣传中国政府的卫生政策，并组织各国的麻风病基金会代表参观广东省的麻风病院，使他们相信2000年在中国消灭麻风病的可能性。事后，各基金会的代表纷纷与中方谈判，表示愿意为在中国消灭麻风病贡献一份力量。
    1983年，曾经在中国战斗过的印度针灸医学委员会主席巴苏在开展工作上遇到困难，他立即写信向马海德同志请教。为了帮助巴苏解决这些问题，马海德通过对外友协邀请他来华。同时，邀请江一真等同志与巴苏共同探讨如何在印度进一步开展针灸工作，经过三天多的讨论，找出了症结的所在，研究了改进的方案，为印度针灸医学委员会的发展打下了良好基础。后来，巴苏因病到北京治疗，马海德特地借来印度歌曲的录音带放给他听，还与其他同志一起邀请胡耀邦同志到医院看望他，给病中的巴苏以最大的安慰。马海德同志就是这样，当别人有困难时，总是满怀热情地伸出援救之手，用火一样的热情温暖着周围的人。但是，他从不计较个人的得失，从不为个人争名争利。为照亮别人而燃尽自己，这正是马海德——一个伟大的国际主义者的写照。
