If I had a brush as thick as a pillar, I would paint the mountains and rivers of Yanbian; if I had a grand song as vast as the sea, I would sing the praises of Yanbian’s 40 years…

The Legend of the Brothers' Rock

In Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture's Longjing City, Badao Township, people see a deep pool beside which two towering rocks, each dozens of meters high, stand abruptly, resembling two brothers arm in arm, gazing at the sky. The legend goes that during the war, a combined unit of Korean and Han ethnicities fighting against the Japanese was surrounded, running out of bullets and food. The steadfast soldiers, arm in arm, jumped into the deep pool, sacrificing their lives. The spirits of the martyrs from the two ethnicities transformed into these steadfast Brothers' Rock, symbolizing the unity of the ethnicities as firm as a rock, eternal for a thousand years. Today, the 19 ethnicities living in Yanbian, including Koreans, Hans, Manchus, and Hui, respect and learn from each other, continuing to write new chapters of the Brothers' Rock, working together to build a beautiful and prosperous borderland.

The Transformation of "Juzistreet"

Standing on Maozishan, looking far and wide, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture's capital—Yanji City, this city nestled in a horseshoe-shaped valley basin, comes into full view. Lush green trees hide the rows of houses; streets crisscross, and several high-rise buildings stand tall and elegant. Some are grand and luxurious, some are simple and practical, some exude an ancient charm, and some are filled with modern vibes. How different from the old "Juzistreet"! This beautiful border city of Yanji is undergoing unprecedented changes.

The Everlasting Rainbow

“Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, who holds the colorful ribbon and dances in the sky?” That rainbow stretching across the sky has always been seen by the Korean people as a symbol of light and beauty. They use the colorful "seven-colored satin" to make children's clothes, letting the children wear the rainbow, foretelling a bright future. However, before liberation, Yanbian's textile industry was at best a few simple workshops making gloves. The "seven-colored satin" could only be like a rainbow hanging in the sky, existing in dreams. Now, the production of ethnic minority special-need products in Yanbian has developed significantly. Industries with ethnic characteristics such as knitting, ceramics, musical instruments, and furniture are scattered everywhere. Yanbian has become one of the industrial bases for ethnic minority special-need products in China. Industries such as machinery, papermaking, textiles, food, medicine, chemicals, electronics, energy, and building materials, either benefiting from the unique natural resources or taking advantage of the favorable conditions brought by reform and opening up, are all developing at an unprecedented speed.

The Cradle of Talent

Basking in the glory of the Party's ethnic policies, various talents of the Korean people in Yanbian are thriving. More and more outstanding Korean cadres are taking up leadership positions at various levels. Among the scientific and technological personnel in Yanbian, there are 36,000 Korean technicians, of whom 14,000 have obtained intermediate and senior professional titles. Yanbian has formed a complete education system from kindergarten to university. The whole prefecture has achieved universal junior high school education. Yanbian University and four other full-time higher education institutions have become cradles for cultivating talents for national construction. The hardworking and brave people of all ethnicities in Yanbian are improving their scientific and cultural literacy, becoming more intelligent, and vigorously investing in the new life, opening up a new horizon for socialist modernization construction.

    欣欣向荣的延边
    ——延边剪影
    孟令哉
    倘有彩笔如椽，请描画延边的山川；倘有壮歌似海，请讴歌延边的40年……
    兄弟岩的传说
    在延边朝鲜族自治州龙井市八道乡，人们看到一处深潭旁，两座数十米高的巨岩突兀而起，酷似两个并肩挽臂的兄弟，昂首青天。传说，当年有一支朝鲜族和汉族战士合编的抗日队伍，遭日寇围困，弹尽粮绝。坚贞不屈的战士，臂挽臂跳进深潭，壮烈殉国。两个民族烈士的英魂化做了这巍然屹立的兄弟岩，昭示着民族团结坚如磐石，千秋永存。如今，延边境内居住的朝、汉、满、回等19个民族，互相尊重、互相学习，继续写着兄弟岩的新篇章，同心协力建设美丽富饶的边疆。
    “局子街”的变迁
    登上帽儿山，纵目远眺，延边朝鲜族自治州首府——延吉市，这雄踞在马蹄形河谷盆地上的城市，尽收眼底。绿树葱茏，掩映着鳞次栉比的房屋；街衢纵横，几座高层建筑俊逸挺拔。有的富丽堂皇，有的朴素大方，有的古香古色，有的洋溢现代气派。变了，当年的“局子街”！延吉这个美丽的边疆城市正经历着日新月异的变化。
     不落的彩虹
    “赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，谁持彩练当空舞？”那横贯长空的彩虹，一向被朝鲜族认为是光明和美丽的象征。他们用色彩绚丽的“七色缎”做童衣，让孩子身披彩虹，预示前程似锦。然而，在解放前，延边的纺织业充其量只是几家织手套的简陋作坊，“七色缎”只能像彩虹一样挂在天上，架在梦中。如今，延边的少数民族特需产品的生产得到长足的发展。具有民族特色的针织、陶瓷、乐器、家具等行业星罗棋布，延边已成为我国民族特需用品工业基地之一。机械、造纸、纺织、食品、医药、化工、电子、能源、建材等工业，或受利于得天独厚的自然资源，或借助于改革开放的天时地利，都以前所未有的速度发展。
    人才的摇篮
    沐浴着党的民族政策的光辉，延边朝鲜族的各类人才，茁壮成长。越来越多的优秀的朝鲜族干部走上各级领导岗位。在延边各类科技人员中，朝鲜族科技人员有3.6万人，其中有1.4万人获得了中高级职称。延边已形成从幼儿教育直到大学的完整教育体系。全州已普及初中教育。延边大学等4所全日制高等院校，成为培养民族建设人才的摇篮。勤劳勇敢的延边各族人民提高科学文化素质，变得更加聪慧，朝气蓬勃地投入新生活，开创着社会主义现代化建设的新天地。（附图片）
