From 1986 to July 1989, the Shapingba District People's Procuratorate in Chongqing investigated 12 cases involving 15 individuals for the crime of embezzling public funds, accounting for approximately 14% of the total economic crime cases, with an increasing trend each year. All of these cases involved embezzlement of more than 100,000 yuan, with the largest case involving 1.38 million yuan. Among the defendants, 6 held leadership positions such as factory director, manager, chief, and section chief; 5 were bank employees.

From these cases, it can be seen that the current embezzlement of public funds mainly falls into several categories:

First, using the funds for personal business. The deputy manager of the Songle Mountain Vegetable Store, Lei Yun Gao, embezzled 38,500 yuan to purchase a passenger car and engage in passenger transportation business.

Second, using the funds for relatives' business. The director of Chongqing Valve Factory, Yu Zhenxiang, embezzled over 24,000 yuan from the Hongyan Valve Business Department to support his brother, Yu Zhenhua, in the fan business.

Third, embezzling public funds for personal gain and transferring them to other units. The director of the Xinqiao Aluminum Products Factory, Wu Xingguo, secretly conducted business with a company and received a salary. Later, he embezzled 1 million yuan, which was loaned by the bank to the factory for purchasing raw materials, and transferred it to this company, causing the Xinqiao Aluminum Products Factory to be on the brink of bankruptcy.

Fourth, squandering and enjoying the funds. The cashier of the Shapingba District Urban Financial Service Department, Diao Xiaoming, embezzled over 38,500 yuan from March to May this year. Apart from using the funds for business and repaying debts, he squandered over 11,000 yuan.

It is suggested that relevant departments should improve the financial system, strengthen financial supervision, and perfect the management mechanism to block the loopholes for embezzling public funds.

    沙坪坝区挪用公款案增加
    1986年至1989年7月，重庆市沙坪坝区人民检察院就立案侦查挪用公款构成犯罪的案件12件15人，约占经济犯罪案件总数的14％，一年比一年上升。这些均为万元以上大案，最多的一起挪用公款达138万元。在被告人中，有6人担任厂长、经理、主任、科长等领导职务；5人是银行职工。
    从这些案件看，当前挪用公款案主要有几种情况：
    一是自己做生意。歌乐山菜店副主任雷运高，挪用公款38500元，购买客车一辆，经营客运业务。
    二是给亲属做生意。重庆阀门厂厂长于振祥，挪用红岩阀门经营部公款24000多元，给其弟于振华做电扇生意。
    三是为捞取私利，挪用公款给其他单位。新桥铝制品杂件厂厂长吴兴国，背着组织到一家公司搞业务、领工资。后来，他将银行贷给本厂购买原材料的10万元，挪用给这家公司，致使新桥铝制品杂件厂濒临倒闭。
    四是挥霍享受。沙坪坝区城市金融服务部出纳员刁晓明，今年3至5月，挪用公款38500多元，除用于做生意和归还欠款外，肆意挥霍达11000多元。
    建议有关部门健全财务制度，搞好财务监督，完善管理机制，堵住挪用公款的漏洞。
