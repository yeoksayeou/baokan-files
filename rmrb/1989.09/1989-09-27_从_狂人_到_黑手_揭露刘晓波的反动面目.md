The Beijing Normal University Chinese Department lecturer Liu Xiaobo, known for his "madman" and "dark horse" reputations, has revealed his "black hand" in the recent turmoil in the capital, which escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion (see June 25 of this newspaper). People cannot help but ask, how did this "madman" slide into the swamp of anti-party and anti-socialism?

Consistently holding a bourgeois liberalization stance

Liu Xiaobo's recent anti-party and anti-socialism activities over the past few months have their ideological foundations. During his time studying and working at the university, Liu Xiaobo exposed a series of problems in his political ideology, academic views, and attitudes towards life, which have been continuously worsening. He used every opportunity to advocate extreme individualism among young students. At the end of 1986, during a speech at a university, he urged contemporary college students to completely discard their sense of mission and responsibility towards the era and the collective, becoming individuals who live solely for themselves, with the slogan "I am my own god." He openly advocated for the extreme emphasis on human instincts, emphasizing sex and money to the extreme, promoting pan-sexualism and materialism. He was enthusiastic about promoting Western bourgeois political and academic cultural thoughts, regarding the theories of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Freud as treasures, singing their praises without criticism. In his articles and speeches, he fervently advocated for the negation of all traditions and the overthrow of all national heritage, thus being seen as a "dark horse" in the literary and theoretical circles who negates everything. He bluntly stated: "I completely negate traditional culture; I think traditional Chinese culture should have no successors." He alarmingly said, "Chinese literature has nothing to be proud of in the new era... I even feel it has something to do with the race." He openly peddled rotten and reactionary racism. He also distorted and defamed Marxism. In 1986, during a class at the Beijing Normal University branch campus, he casually said, "Materialism is shallow," and "Marxism is extreme." During night school lectures, he completely negated Lenin's principle of party literature. The series of erroneous views that Liu Xiaobo advocated and spread played a role in promoting the spread of bourgeois liberalization, having a very bad corrosive effect on young students. Therefore, the party and administrative leaders of the school and department, as well as many teachers, had seriously criticized and admonished him. However, as Liu Xiaobo's so-called "fame" increased, along with the unprincipled flattery and praise from some people in society at that time, he became even more self-inflated, completely disregarding these criticisms and admonitions, and continued to slide down the path of heresy.

Completely opposing the four cardinal principles

From last August to this April, Liu Xiaobo spent eight months abroad. During this period, he fearlessly produced and published a series of articles and speeches that openly opposed the four cardinal principles, completely sliding into the reactionary swamp.

In Norway, during his transit through Hong Kong en route to the U.S., and while in the U.S., he successively published articles and speeches in some Hong Kong newspapers, including "The Devil Mao Zedong," "Contemporary Chinese Intellectuals and Politics," "The Literary 'Dark Horse' Liu Xiaobo," "At the Bottom of the Qigong Fever," "May Hong Kong Always Be a Free Port," "At the Gate of Hell — A Re-examination of Marxism," "Two Different Types of Marxism," "The Tragedy of the Tragic Hero," and "Perfecting the System or Creating a Perfect Leader."

In these articles and speeches, Liu Xiaobo launched a comprehensive and systematic attack on our fundamental principles of the state — the "four cardinal principles." He completely disregarded historical facts, maliciously attacking and slandering the Communist Party of China, saying that many intellectuals with hot blood joined the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to fight for democracy and freedom, and some became allies of the two parties. However, these two parties quickly degenerated into authoritarian political machines. Especially the Communist Party, from the day it seized power, began ruthless dictatorship. He attacked that in contemporary China, due to the ruling party's power being above everything, there is no guarantee of democratic politics, therefore "anyone in power will turn to dictatorship, and if we only negate Mao Zedong as a tyrant without negating him as a representative of rotten authoritarianism, then we have done nothing, the result will only be a replacement of a tyrannical dictator with an enlightened dictator." Liu Xiaobo slandered the Communist Party of China as an authoritarian political machine and fiercely opposed it. He attacked our socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship as tyranny, shouting, "The contemporary Chinese tyrants are so unrestrained, so they take unreasonableness as the truth," he greatly beautified the capitalist system, saying, "The difference between Westernization and the Chinese system is the difference between human and inhuman, to live a human life, one must completely Westernize, with no room for compromise or adjustment." He openly incited, "As long as people still believe that only authoritarian socialism and dogmatic Marxism can save China, that is believing that political authoritarianism and ideological dictatorship can save China." He also openly incited people to oppose the socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship, "Tyranny is not scary, what is scary is the submission, silence, or praise of tyranny. As long as one decides to resist to the end, authoritarianism will not last long no matter how brutal it is."

In these reactionary articles, Liu Xiaobo also launched a frenzied attack on Marxism. He attacked that the ideal of Marxism is too cheap, even cursing Marx's saying that capitalism prepares the material conditions for the proletarian revolution and the realization of communism as "the stupid part of Marx's ideal." He attacked, "Marxism in China is a tool of the ruling class, a club, with no theoretical significance." He shouted, "In China and the Soviet Union, as long as the dictators do not give up the ideological dictatorship under the banner of Marxism, the truly awakened should not give up the criticism of Marxism."

Liu Xiaobo's large number of reactionary political statements posed a comprehensive challenge to the four cardinal principles. While completely negating the four cardinal principles, he proposed a "prescription" for governing China. He believed that in China, "one cannot seek the power to negate authoritarianism from within authoritarianism." "In politics, one cannot seek the power to oppose one-party dictatorship from within one-party dictatorship; in economics, one cannot seek the power to reform the economy from within public ownership and planned economy; in ideology, one cannot seek new ideas from within dogmatic Marxism; in the broad sense of culture, one cannot seek the so-called essence from within traditional Chinese culture. Instead, one must replace one-party dictatorship with a multi-party democratic system; replace public ownership and planned economy with private ownership and market economy; replace ideological monism with multi-faceted speech and thought freedom."

Liu Xiaobo's proposals are essentially a reactionary program to establish a bourgeois republic. The essence of Liu Xiaobo's advocacy is to establish a country that is politically, economically, and culturally dependent on Western imperialism.

Reactionary face fully exposed

After the turmoil in Beijing, Liu Xiaobo returned to the country on April 27.

Soon after returning to Beijing, Liu Xiaobo established contact with the leaders of the illegal student organization "Student Autonomous Federation." He handed over his article "Reflections on the Phenomenon of Hu Yaobang's Death," published in the World Journal, to the relevant leaders, and the article was quickly broadcast on the illegal "Autonomous Federation Radio Station."

Liu Xiaobo eagerly threw out this article to steer the direction of the then turmoil onto his political track, that is, to gradually replace our socialist system with the political model of Western capitalism. In this article, he was extremely dissatisfied and criticized the students' activities to mourn Comrade Hu Yaobang, and even completely negated the previous activities to mourn Premier Zhou Enlai, believing that "affirming the two clean officials of the Communist Party can only put lipstick on the socialist system." Liu Xiaobo advocated that students should learn from Wei Jingsheng, believing that he is the true fighter for democracy. Due to the too blatant anti-party and anti-socialist nature of this article, the "Autonomous Federation Radio Station" had to declare that Liu Xiaobo's article only represented his own views. Regarding Liu Xiaobo's special role, the core members of the school's Student Autonomous Federation once said, "Wuerkaixi is our action leader, Liu Xiaobo is our ideological leader."

Liu Xiaobo and the leaders of the "High Autonomous Federation" boasted to students about organizing a large-scale hunger strike of 1,000 to 5,000 intellectuals to continue pushing the turmoil to a climax. After this idea failed, Liu Xiaobo finally found a few so-called "personal friends" and staged the last farce on Tiananmen Square before the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, that is, the four-person 48-hour to 72-hour limited hunger strike. On the evening of June 1, before participating in the limited hunger strike, Liu Xiaobo made a speech through the school gate's broadcast. He bluntly said, "Now the government repeatedly emphasizes a small number of people, the so-called handful, which seems to refer to people like me who are not students. But I want to say... I am not afraid to be a black hand, I am proud to be a black hand, I am proud and honored!" However, the development of history is not subject to the will of Liu Xiaobo and others. Their attempt to push socialist China into reverse and establish a Western-style bourgeois republic can only end in failure.

    从“狂人”到“黑手”
    ——揭露刘晓波的反动面目
    石达文
    向来有“狂人”、“黑马”之称的北京师范大学中文系讲师刘晓波，在这次首都发生的学潮、动乱到反革命暴乱中伸出的“黑手”，已经大白天下了（见6月25日本报）。人们不禁会问，这位“狂人”是怎样滑向反党、反社会主义的泥潭的呢？
    一贯坚持资产阶级自由化立场
    刘晓波近几个月来的反党反社会主义活动是有其思想基础的。在师大学习和工作期间，刘晓波在政治思想、学术观点、人生态度上就暴露出一系列问题，并不断恶性发展。他利用各种机会，在青年学生当中鼓吹极端个人主义。1986年底，他在一所大学的演说中，要当代大学生脱胎换骨，完全抛弃对时代和集体的使命感、责任感，成为完全为自己、“自己就是上帝”的人，鼓吹极端个人主义。他在清华大学等高校演讲时还赤裸裸地宣扬，要把人的本能强调到极端，要把性、金钱强调到极点，宣扬泛性主义和拜金主义。他热衷于宣扬西方资产阶级的政治思想和学术文化思想，把尼采、叔本华以及弗洛伊德的学说视为至宝，不加批判地大唱赞歌，他在文章和演讲中，狂热地鼓吹否定一切传统、打倒一切民族遗产的思想，因此被视为文艺界、理论界否定一切的一匹“黑马”。他直言不讳地声称：“对传统文化我全面否定，我认为中国传统文化早该后继无人”，说什么“中国的文学只有打倒屈原、杜甫才有出路”。他危言耸听地说：“新时期文学没有什么值得骄傲的东西……我甚至感到是与人种不无关系的。”公然兜售腐朽反动的种族主义。他对马克思主义也进行歪曲和诋毁，1986年他在师大分校上课时信口雌黄地说：“唯物主义是浅薄的”、“马克思主义是偏激的”。在夜大讲课时，全盘否定列宁的文学党性原则。刘晓波鼓吹和散布的一系列错误观点，对资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥起了推波助澜的作用，在青年学生中产生了很坏的腐蚀作用。因此，校系党政领导和不少老师曾对他进行严肃的批评和规劝。但是随着刘晓波所谓“知名度”的提高，加上当时社会上一些人无原则的迎合和吹捧，他更加自我膨胀，完全不把这些批评和规劝放在心上，向着离经叛道的邪路继续滑下去。
            全面反对四项基本原则
    从去年8月到今年4月下旬，刘晓波在国外活动了8个月。这期间，他更无所顾忌，炮制、发表了一系列公开反对四项基本原则的文章和谈话，完全滑入反动的泥坑。
    他在挪威、赴美途经香港以及在美期间，先后在香港的一些报刊上发表了《混世魔王毛泽东》、《中国当代知识分子与政治》、《文坛“黑马”刘晓波》、《在“气功热”的底层》、《但愿香港永远是自由港》、《在地狱的入口处——对马克思主义的再讨论》、《两种不同的马克思主义》、《悲剧英雄的悲剧》、《完善制度还是塑造完美领袖》等反党反社会主义的文章和谈话。
    在这些文章和谈话中，刘晓波向我们的立国之本——“四项基本原则”进行了全面系统的攻击。他完全不顾历史事实，恶毒攻击、诬蔑中国共产党，说什么“有多少热血的知识人为争民主、自由而加入了国民党和共产党，有些成为两党的同盟者。但是这两党很快地蜕变为专制独裁的政治机器。特别是共产党，从它夺取政权的第一天起就开始了残酷的独裁。”他攻击在当代中国由于执政党的权力高于一切，没有民主政治的保证，因此“任何掌权者都将走向独裁，因而，如果仅仅把毛泽东作为一个昏君来否定，而不是把他作为腐朽的专制主义的代表来否定，那么等于什么也没做，其结果只能是一个开明的独裁者代替昏庸的独裁者”。刘晓波把中国共产党诬蔑为专制独裁的政治机器，疯狂地加以反对。他攻击我国社会主义制度和人民民主专政是暴政，叫嚷“当代中国的专制者如此肆无忌惮，如此把不讲理当作真理，”他大肆美化资本主义制度，胡说：“西化与中国制度的区别就是人与非人的区别，要过人的生活就要全盘西化，没有和稀泥及调和的余地。”他公然煽动说：“只要人们还相信只有专制化的社会主义和教条化的马克思主义才能救中国，那就是相信政治专制、思想独裁才能救中国。”他还公开煽动人们反对社会主义制度和人民民主专政，“暴政并不可怕，可怕的是对暴政的屈服、沉默或赞美。只要决定反抗到底，专制主义再残暴也不会长久。”
    刘晓波在这些反动文章中，对马克思主义也进行了疯狂的攻击。他攻击马克思主义的理想太廉价了，甚至谩骂马克思说的资本主义为无产阶级革命和实现共产主义准备了物质条件是“马克思的理想的混蛋的地方”。他攻击“马克思主义在中国是统治阶级的工具，是棍子，不具有理论意义。”他叫嚣：“在中国和苏联，专制者一天不放弃以马克思主义为招牌的思想独裁，真正的觉醒者就应该一天不放弃对马克思主义的批判。”
    刘晓波这些大量的反动政治言论，向四项基本原则提出了全面挑战。他在完全否定四项基本原则的同时，开了一个治理中国的“药方”。他认为，在中国“不能从专制主义的内部来寻找否定专制主义的力量。”“在政治上不能从一党独裁的内部寻找力量来反一党独裁；在经济上，不能从公有制、计划经济的内部寻找动力来改革经济；在思想上，不能从教条化的马克思主义内部来寻找新的思想；在广义的文化上，不能从中国传统文化的内部来寻找所谓的精华。而只能以多党并存的民主制代替一党独裁；用私有制、市场经济代替公有制、计划经济；用多元言论、思想的自由来代替思想一元化。”
    刘晓波的这些主张，实际上是建立资产阶级共和国的反动纲领。刘晓波鼓吹的实质，是要建立一个政治上、经济上、思想文化上完全依附于西方帝国主义的附庸国。
          反动面目充分暴露
    北京发生学潮、动乱后，刘晓波于4月27日从美国回国。
    刘晓波返回北京后不久，就和当时学校非法组织“学生自治会”的头头们建立了联系。他把在《世界日报》上发表的文章《胡耀邦逝世现象的省思》交给有关头头，文章很快就在非法组织“自治会广播台”播放。
    刘晓波迫不及待抛出这篇文章的目的，是想将当时学潮的方向引入他的政治轨道上，即以西方资本主义的政治模式来逐步取代我国的社会主义制度。他在这篇文章中极为不满并指责学生悼念胡耀邦同志的活动，甚至对以前悼念周恩来总理的活动也全部加以否定，认为“肯定两个共产党的清官只能给社会主义制度涂脂抹粉”。刘晓波鼓吹学生要效法魏京生，认为他才是真正争取民主的斗士。由于这篇文章的反党反社会主义性质太露骨了，所以“自治会广播台”也不得不声明刘晓波的这篇文章只代表他自己的观点。对刘晓波的特殊作用，校学生自治会的骨干分子曾说：“吾尔开希是我们的行动领袖，刘晓波是我们的思想领袖。”
    刘晓波和“高自联”头头在学生中扬言要组织1000人到5000人的知识界大绝食，继续把动乱推向高潮。这一想法破产后，刘晓波最终不得不找了几个所谓“私人朋友”，演出了平息反革命暴乱前天安门广场的最后一幕闹剧即四人48小时—72小时的有限期绝食。6月1日晚，刘晓波在去参加有限期绝食前夕通过校门口的广播作了一番演讲。他直言不讳地说：“现在政府一再强调极少数人，所谓的一小撮，它的所指现在看来就是类似我这样不是学生身份的人。但我想说……我不怕当黑手，我反而以当黑手而自豪，而骄傲，而光荣！”但是历史的发展是不以刘晓波等人的主观意志为转移的，他们妄图把社会主义制度的中国推向后转，建立西方式的资产阶级共和国，这种幻想不能不以最后破产而告终。
