The seamless track laying project for the Xiang-Gui and Li-Zhan railways under the jurisdiction of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau has been completed throughout the line. This marks the connection of a seamless track stretching from Lengshuitan in Hunan Province, passing through Guangxi's Guilin, Liuzhou, and Litang, to Zhanjiang in Guangdong Province, with a total length of 909 kilometers.

A seamless track is constructed by welding 25-meter-long steel rails into lengths of 125 to 250 meters, and then using a mobile gas-pressure welding machine to weld several of these long rails together. The track is then laid in sections ranging from one to two kilometers in length.
