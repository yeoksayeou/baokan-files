Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 22nd.

The State Council recently approved the awarding of three major scientific and technological achievements with the 1989 National Science and Technology Progress Award Special Class. Of these, two that can be disclosed are "Research and Development of a Complete Set of Equipment for a 1,000 Million Ton Class Large Open-Pit Mine" and "Comprehensive Utilization of Resources at Jinchuan." The third achievement is not disclosed.

The successful development of a complete set of equipment for a 1,000 million ton class large open-pit mine has made China the second country in the world capable of producing such equipment. The "Comprehensive Utilization of Resources at Jinchuan" has changed the long-term situation in China where the extraction of nickel, cobalt, and other precious metals mainly relied on imports, promoting the development of related industries such as national raw material industries, defense industries, and light industries.

Thus, since the establishment of the Science and Technology Progress Award in 1984, the State Council has approved a total of 32 national-level Science and Technology Progress Award Special Class awards.

    经国务院批准
    三项重大科技成果  获科技进步特等奖
    据新华社北京9月22日电  （记者卓培荣）国务院日前批准授予三项重大科技成果1989年国家级科技进步奖特等奖。其中可公布的两项是“一千万吨级大型露天矿成套设备研制”和“金川资源综合利用”，另一项不予公布。
    一千万吨级大型露天矿成套设备研制成功，使我国成为世界上第二个能生产此类成套设备的国家。“金川资源综合利用”改变了我国长期以来采镍、钴等贵金属主要依靠进口的状况，促进了国家原材料工业、国防工业和轻工业等有关行业的发展。
    这样，自1984年我国设立科技进步奖以来，国务院已先后批准授予32项国家级科技进步奖特等奖。
