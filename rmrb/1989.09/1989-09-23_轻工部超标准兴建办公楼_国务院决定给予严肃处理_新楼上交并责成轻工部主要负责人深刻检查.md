The Ministry of Light Industry's construction of an office building, which exceeded standards and budgets and misused funds, has recently been severely investigated. The State Council has decided that the Ministry of Light Industry will not be able to use the newly constructed office building. The building will be handed over to the State Council's Bureau of General Affairs for disposal, and all proceeds will be turned over to the national treasury. The Ministry of Light Industry will be provided with alternative office space. The principal responsible person of the Ministry of Light Industry will conduct a thorough self-examination of the errors committed.

The construction of the Ministry of Light Industry's office building began in September 1986 and was basically completed by the end of 1988. According to investigations by the State Supervision Bureau, the State Planning Commission, the National Audit Office, and other departments, the Ministry of Light Industry violated relevant regulations of the "Administrative Office Building Construction Standards" during the construction of the office building, seriously exceeding standards and budgets. The exterior of the office building was decorated with glass curtain walls, aluminum alloy windows, and marble cladding. The exterior of the offices had balconies added, and the interior had suspended ceilings, glazed floor tiles, and central air conditioning installed throughout the building, with each room equipped with an air conditioner. The first-floor lobby walls were clad with expensive granite, and a dedicated waiting room was set up. The six department chief offices each measured over 70 square meters, with additional rest rooms and private bathrooms. During the construction of the building, foreign exchange was spent to import materials from abroad. The Ministry of Light Industry also violated relevant regulations on basic construction investment, failing to report to the supervisory department, resulting in the actual investment in the office building exceeding the original design budget by two and a half times.

The State Supervision Bureau believes that the Ministry of Light Industry's construction of the office building, which exceeded standards and budgets and misused funds, was an act of extravagance and waste, contrary to the Party Central Committee and the State Council's consistent advocacy for state organs to strive for hard work and frugality, and in violation of national regulations on office building construction standards.

The principal responsible person of the Ministry of Light Industry, in accordance with the decision of the State Council, has conducted a self-examination of the responsibility for constructing the luxurious office building and has expressed a willingness to actively cooperate with the State Supervision Bureau in handling the matter and to seriously learn from the lessons.

    轻工部超标准兴建办公楼
    国务院决定给予严肃处理
    新楼上交并责成轻工部主要负责人深刻检查
    本报北京9月22日讯　记者舒瑜报道：轻工业部建设办公楼存在的超标准、超概算、资金使用不当问题，最近受到严肃查处。经国务院研究决定：轻工业部不能使用新建的办公楼，该办公楼交国务院机关事务管理局统一处理，所得收益全部上交国家财政；轻工业部办公用房另行予以解决；轻工业部主要负责人对其所犯错误作出深刻检查。
    轻工业部办公楼于1986年9月正式开工，1988年底基本建成。经国家监察部、国家计委、国家审计署等部门查实，轻工业部在办公楼建设中，违反国家关于《行政办公楼建设标准》的有关规定，严重超标准、超概算。办公楼外装修安装玻璃幕墙、铝合金门窗、大理石贴面；办公室外部加设阳台，内部安装吊顶，彩釉地面砖，办公楼内部安装整体中央空调，每个房间都装有空调器；一层门厅墙壁采用价格昂贵的花岗岩贴面，设置专用候客厅；6套部长办公室每间70多平方米，另配休息间和专用洗澡间等。在大楼建设中花费外汇从国外进口材料。轻工业部还违反基本建设投资的有关规定，未向主管部门报告，使办公楼实际投资超过原设计概算的两倍半。
    监察部认为，轻工业部建设办公楼超标准、超概算、资金使用不当，是铺张浪费的行为，违背了党中央和国务院一贯倡导的国家机关要艰苦奋斗的要求，违反了国家关于建设办公楼建设标准的规定。
    轻工业部主要负责人遵照国务院的决定，已对建设豪华办公楼问题应负责任进行了检查，表示要积极配合监察部进行处理，并认真吸取教训。
