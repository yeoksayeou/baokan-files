    阎明复在民建中央五届四次常委会上说
    多党合作制度要有新发展
    本报北京9月5日讯　新华社记者张严平、本报记者袁建达报道：中共中央统战部部长阎明复在今天开幕的民建中央五届四次常委会上说，我国的爱国统一战线和共产党领导的多党合作制度，是由毛泽东、周恩来等老一辈无产阶级革命家创建的，是经得起历史考验的。中共十三届四中全会以后，党中央多次重申中共十一届三中全会以来的统一战线政策和方针决不会改变。今后中共要同各民主党派长期合作下去，共产党领导的多党合作制度要在现有的基础上进一步发展。
    阎明复说，当前统一战线的任务是要深入贯彻中共十三届四中全会和邓小平同志的讲话精神，最大限度地团结一切可以团结的力量，为治理整顿、深化改革做出贡献。
    民建中央主席孙起孟主持今天的会议并讲话。
    民建中央副主席万国权代表中央执行局向会议作了工作报告。报告提出民建下一步要做的主要工作，一是加强改进民建的思想政治工作，促进自身建设；二是发挥民建同经济界密切联系的特点，广泛开展科研活动，为国家的经济工作献计出力。
    中共中央统战部副部长宋堃也出席了今天的会议。
