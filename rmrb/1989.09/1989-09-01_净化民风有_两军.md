In the past, farmers in the Cangzhou region often lamented, "You can raise a son, but you can't marry off a daughter," "You can support the living, but you can't bury the dead," "After years of hard work, one event can ruin everything." Just as the people's hopes were high, some villages in the Cangzhou region saw the emergence of a "volunteer army"—the Red and White Affairs Management Committee. This is a self-governing organization for the people to manage, educate, and serve themselves. This grassroots self-governing organization, which arose in response to the people's will, immediately gained widespread support from all sectors of society and sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain across the vast rural areas of the region. By the end of 1986, 89.1% of the rural areas in the region had established Red and White Affairs Management Committees, and now they have been universally established and are flourishing everywhere.

This vibrant flower has taken root in fertile soil and permeated the hearts of the farmers. After the establishment of the committee in Fuzhuang Village, Renqiu City, whenever villagers encountered red and white affairs, they would enthusiastically go to the door to serve, not only reducing the economic burden for the hosts but also relieving them of the pressure of public opinion that says "not being filial." After the death of Zhou Xiaoguo's mother, the committee members helped with the arrangements, and with just one pack of cigarettes and one pack of tea, costing 20 yuan, the matter was settled. Farmer Fu Baonan handled three affairs in two years. If done according to the old customs, it would have cost at least ten thousand yuan, but the committee helped to simplify everything, spending less than a thousand yuan.

To promote the healthy growth of the Red and White Affairs Management Committee, the Cangzhou region's counties and townships have conducted training for committee members in stages and levels, established and improved regulations, and developed the committee towards institutionalization, standardization, and scientific management, making the "volunteer army" even more powerful. Last year, the region handled 25,586 red and white affairs, saving more than ten million yuan.

Within the "volunteer army," there is also a "Red Army of Women" consisting of 20,000 people, actively engaged in the frontline of purifying customs. Among the members of the anti-gambling association, there are female strongmen who dare to fight against feudal customs, as well as "reformed gamblers" who have left the gambling dens and joined the anti-gambling battle.

The anti-gambling association has become the "nemesis" of the gambling wind. In 1986, the region had more than 1,500 family disputes, more than 1,000 fights, and more than 2,000 cases of theft and fraud due to gambling. In Guoqiao Village, Haixing County, Wang Jintong was addicted to gambling, losing all his property. His wife, Liu Fengmei, drank rat poison in anger and was lucky to be saved in time. Farmer Ding Baotong from Renqiu City was always in the gambling dens, making his mother so angry that she took poison and died... When the women's anti-gambling association started its activities, it was like a warm spring breeze, not only saving some families but also purifying people's minds and maintaining social stability. In Diannan Village, Nanpi County, there was an old man named Liu. His daughter-in-law tried to persuade him to quit gambling but was scolded. The daughter-in-law was clever and changed her strategy, serving him good food and wine for three meals a day. Old Liu was puzzled: "Where do we have so much money? Don't do this anymore." The daughter-in-law seized the opportunity: "Father, if you don't gamble anymore, our whole family can eat well and won't run out of money. As the saying goes, gambling is a trap!" These words woke Old Liu up, and he happily quit gambling. Relevant data shows: "From December 1987 to March 1988, in just four months, due to the joint efforts of the public security and the masses, especially the role of the women's anti-gambling association, the region caught 570 gambling incidents, detained 3,044 gamblers, confiscated 560 sets of gambling tools, confiscated 187,158 yuan in gambling money, punished 20,301 people, and fined 29,595 yuan."

### 净化民风有“两军”

    净化民风有“两军”
    沧州地区的农民过去曾感叹不已：“养得起儿子，娶不起媳妇”，“养得起活人，葬不起死人”，“辛苦干几年，办一宗事就折腾完”。
    正当众望殷殷之际，沧州地区一些村落出现一支“义勇军”——红白事理事会。它是群众自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的自治组织。这一顺乎民意应运而生的群众自治组织一出现，立刻得到了全社会的广泛支持，如雨后春笋似地在全区广大农村发展起来。到1986年底，全区已有89.1％的农村建起了红白事理事会，如今已村村普及、遍地开花了。
    这绚丽多姿的鲜花，扎根肥土沃壤，香沁农民心田。任丘市傅家村建起理事会后，每逢村民遇到红白事，便热情地登门服务，不仅为事主减轻了经济负担，还为事主解脱了怕说“不孝”的舆论压力。村民周小果母亲病故后，理事们帮着上门操持，一条烟、一包茶，花了20元钱就把事办了。村民傅保安两年间办了三宗事，要按旧风习办，少说也得上万元，理事会帮着一切从简，花了不足千元。
    为了促进红白事理事会这一新生事物茁壮成长，沧州地区县、乡对理事会成员分期、分层次进行了培训，建立健全了规章制度，使理事会向制度化、规范化、科学化发展，使“义勇军”更展雄威。去年，全区办理婚丧事25586件，节约资金超过千万元。
    在“义勇军”队伍中，还有一支两万之众的“红色娘子军”——妇女禁赌会，活跃在净化民风的前沿阵地上。禁赌会的成员中，有敢于向封建陋习作斗争的女强人，还有退出赌场走向禁赌战场的“回头浪子”。
    禁赌会成了赌博风的“克星”。1986年全区因赌博造成家庭纠纷1500多起，打架斗殴1000多起，偷盗诈骗2000多起。海兴县郭桥村王金忠，赌博成癖，家产输光，其妻刘风梅一气之下喝了鼠药，幸亏抢救及时才免遭一死。任丘市农民丁宝通，整天泡在赌场里，气得母亲服毒身亡……妇女禁赌会的活动一开展，如春风送暖，不仅拯救了一些家庭，同时也净化了人们的心灵，维护了社会的安定。南皮县店南村有个刘老汉，儿媳劝其戒赌，遭到训斥。儿媳颇有心计，改变策略，一日三餐给老人摆上美酒佳肴。刘老汉感到纳闷：“咱哪有这么多钱？以后别这样了。”儿媳顺水推舟：“爹，你如果不玩牌了，咱全家都吃好的也用不完。俗话说，牌局是陷阱啊！”一席话说得刘老汉如梦方醒，高高兴兴地戒了赌。有关资料提供了这样的数据：“自1987年12月至1988年3月仅4个月时间，由于公安、干群的通力协作，特别是注意发挥了妇女禁赌会的作用，全区共抓赌570场，查获参赌人员3044名，没收赌具560副，没收赌资187158元，处罚20301人次，罚款29595元。”
