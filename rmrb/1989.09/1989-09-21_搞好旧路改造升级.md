In China, out of nearly 1 million kilometers of roads, only 1.6% are classified as first or second-class, 12.4% as third-class, 45.7% as fourth-class, and the remaining 40.2% are below standard. Due to the poor quality of the roads, the actual driving speed is around 30 kilometers per hour, which is almost half of the economic speed.

Experts estimate that if third-class roads are upgraded to second-class (from gravel to asphalt), the annual benefits per 10,000 kilometers would include: an increase in driving speed by 15 kilometers per hour, a 50% increase in vehicle towing capacity, and an overall improvement in transportation efficiency by 35% to 45%. Additionally, tire life can be extended by over 40,000 kilometers, fuel consumption can be reduced by 15% to 30%, and the interval between major engine overhauls can be increased by 80%. Assuming 1,000 vehicle trips per day, each 10,000 kilometers of road can save 90,000 tires and 110,000 tons of diesel per year, reducing transportation costs by 20%.

Therefore, under conditions of limited financial resources and materials, and given the low efficiency of existing roads for various reasons, it is currently necessary to allocate limited funds and resources to upgrade existing roads. This will transform the existing national highway mainline system into a safe, fast, and efficient highway system for automobiles. Except for necessary coordination with ports to build a comprehensive transportation network and a few special regions, new roads should be built as little as possible in the near term.

    搞好旧路改造升级
    国家科委政策司副司长　孔德涌
    我国近100万公里的公路中，一二级只占1.6％，三级占12.4％，四级占45.7％，其余40.2％为等外。由于公路质量差，实际行车时速为30多公里，几乎是经济时速的一半。
    据专家估计，只要把三级公路改成二级公路（沙石路面改成沥青路面），每万公里的年效益为：行车时速可提高15公里，车辆拖挂能力可提高50％以上，仅此，运输效益便可提高35％—45％。此外，轮胎寿命可延长4万公里以上，油耗可节省15％—30％，发动机大修间隔里程可增加80％。以每天一千车次计算，每万公里一年可节省轮胎9万多条、柴油11万多吨，运输成本减少20％。
    因此，在财力紧张、资金有限的条件下，在旧路因种种原因效益很低情况下，当前应当把有限资金、有限物力用于旧路的改造升级，使现有国道主干线系统全部成为一二级的安全、快速、高效汽车专用路。除了必需与港口配合构筑综合运输网以及极个别地区外，近期要尽可能少建新路。
