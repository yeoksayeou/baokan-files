    Three Hopes for Food Hygiene Inspections

    It is unknown from which year and month people started to be less welcoming to the numerous inspection teams. However, many people not only welcome food hygiene inspections but also have three hopes for them:

    The first hope is that food hygiene inspections should be frequent.

    Currently, many places have numerous problems with food hygiene. Recently, the Huaiyin City Federation of Trade Unions and the city's Price, Industry and Commerce, Metrology, and Health departments jointly inspected cold beverage production and sales units in the city. The results showed that none of the four types of samples—ice pops, ice cream, ice lollies, and soda—were up to standard. In this inspection, 81 production and sales units and individuals were penalized, and nearly 20,000 bottles (packets) of spoiled soda, beer, and pickled vegetables were sealed and destroyed. The problems are so serious; it would have been better if they had been discovered and resolved earlier! Since so many problems have been found, can they be completely resolved in one go? Therefore, we hope for frequent inspections.

    The second hope is that problems found should be dealt with severely.

    Severity means not only that all substandard and spoiled food products should be destroyed on the spot but, more importantly, that the issues should not be dealt with superficially. Instead, the root causes should be investigated and addressed. For example, some food products do not meet standards due to insufficient ingredients or reduced processes. Some have far too little sugar or carbonation. Some even falsely claim to be provincial or municipal award-winning products.

    All these issues need to be addressed fundamentally by the relevant departments. How else can they be resolved?

    The third hope is that “all parties should work together” to jointly fight the overall battle for food hygiene.

    From the inspections, many products lack production factory information, production dates, specifications, formulas, and storage and shelf life dates. Many food vendors and some state-owned and collective units lack business licenses, health permits, and health certificates for selling food. A large number of spoiled products are circulating in the market.

    To solve these problems, of course, it is not something that a single department can handle alone. Therefore, it is necessary for all parties to work together to solve these issues.

### 食品卫生检查三盼

    食品卫生检查三盼
    不知从何年何月起，人们对名目繁多的检查组并不是怎么欢迎的。但是许多人对食品卫生检查不但十分欢迎，且有三盼：
    一盼食品卫生检查要勤。
    目前，不少地方食品卫生方面存在的问题很多。前不久，江苏省淮阴市总工会和市物价、工商、计量、卫生等部门联合对市区冷饮食品生产、经销单位进行一次检查，其结果是冰棒、雪糕、冰淇淋和汽水四类样品质量无一合格。在这次检查中共有81个生产、经销单位和个人受到处罚，有近两万瓶（袋）变质汽水、啤酒、榨菜等食品被封存销毁。问题如此严重，要是早检查早发现早解决多好！既然查出这么多问题了，一次性能彻底解决么？所以盼检查要勤。
    二盼查出问题处理要狠。
    狠，不仅是对查出的伪劣和变质食品当销毁的要当场全部销毁，更重要的是不搞就事论事处理了事，而是要追究到底，处理到底。比如有的食品是由于投料不足，减少某些工序，总体不达标准；有的含糖、含汽量远远不足；有的甚至还冠以省优或市优产品招摇过市。
    这一切不请有关部门从根本上去解决，怎么能行？
    三盼“各方神仙都显灵”，齐心协力打好食品卫生总体战。
    从检查看，许多商品无生产厂家、无出厂日期、无规格配方、无保存保质日期，许多经营食品的摊点和部分国营、集体单位无经营食品的经营执照、无卫生许可证、无健康检查证，大量变质商品充斥于市。
    要解决这些问题，当然不是一个部门能单独解决的。因此，需要各方协力共同解决。
