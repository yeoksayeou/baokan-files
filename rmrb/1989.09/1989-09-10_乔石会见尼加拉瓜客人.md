Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 10th.

Qiao Shi met with Nicaraguan guests this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People. The guests included members of the National Leadership Committee of the Nicaraguan Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Minister of External Cooperation, Henry Ruiz, and his delegation.

Qiao Shi, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, extended a warm welcome to the visiting guests. He briefed them on China's situation since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in June this year. He said that the current situation in Beijing and throughout the country is stable.

Ruiz stated that Nicaragua unconditionally supports China's decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He noted that imperialism not only seeks to destroy China but also other Third World countries. Nicaragua opposes all forms of foreign intervention and believes that China's internal affairs should be resolved by the Chinese themselves.

Qiao Shi expressed China's gratitude for Nicaragua's understanding and support in the struggle against the rebellion.

Ruiz then briefed Qiao Shi on the situation in Nicaragua. He said that Nicaragua persists in its struggle against imperialism while also seeking to resolve issues through peaceful means.

Qiao Shi stated that China firmly supports Nicaragua's struggle to defend its national sovereignty and build its nation. He said that both China and Nicaragua face urgent tasks in developing their economies, which require both self-effort and international friendly cooperation.

Qiao Shi emphasized that experience has shown that China, Nicaragua, and other Third World countries must not exchange their already achieved political independence and liberation for economic benefits. "We need to develop our economies on the basis of self-reliance and conduct external exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but we must not change our principles."

Qiao Shi expressed his belief that the friendly cooperative relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Sandinista National Liberation Front, as well as between China and Nicaragua, will continue to develop. He said, "We are all friends from poor countries, and poor friends will have more common language."

　　乔石会见尼加拉瓜客人
    新华社北京9月10日电　（记者朱云龙）中共中央政治局常委乔石今天下午在人民大会堂会见了尼加拉瓜共和国桑地诺民族解放阵线全国领导委员会成员、对外合作部部长亨利·鲁伊斯一行。
    乔石代表中共中央对客人们来访表示热烈欢迎。他介绍了中国在今年6月平息反革命暴乱的情况。他说，目前北京和全国各地的局势是稳定的。
    鲁伊斯说，尼加拉瓜无条件地支持中国为平息反革命暴乱所采取的果断措施。帝国主义不仅对中国进行破坏，也对其他第三世界国家进行破坏。尼加拉瓜反对一切外来干涉，认为中国的内部事务应由中国自己来解决。
    乔石说，中国感谢尼加拉瓜对平暴斗争的理解和支持。
    鲁伊斯向乔石介绍了尼加拉瓜的情况。他说，尼加拉瓜对帝国主义既坚持斗争，又注意通过和平方式来解决问题。
    乔石说，中国坚决支持尼加拉瓜为捍卫国家主权和建设国家所进行的斗争。他说，中尼两国都面临着发展本国经济的迫切任务，这既要靠自己的努力，又要开展国际间的友好合作。
    乔石强调说，经验告诉我们，中国、尼加拉瓜以及其他第三世界国家决不能用已经取得的政治独立和解放去换取经济好处。“我们需要在自力更生的基础上发展经济，需要在平等互利的基础上开展对外交往，但决不能改变自己的原则。”
    乔石表示相信，中国共产党和桑地诺民族解放阵线以及中尼两国的友好合作关系会不断发展。他说：“我们都是穷朋友，穷朋友之间的共同语言会更多一些。”
