Jinan Airport, renovated through a joint investment by the Jinan Military Region Air Force and the Shandong Provincial Government, has completed its renovation project and resumed operations. Today, a British-made Trident aircraft successfully completed its maiden flight on the newly opened "Beijing-Jinan-Fuzhou" route.

The renovated Jinan Airport has not only joined the ranks of the 57 airports nationwide capable of handling medium and large passenger aircraft but also ended the historical lack of direct air routes between Shandong and Fujian provinces. This development will facilitate economic and cultural exchanges between the Shandong Peninsula, the Minjiang Delta, and the broader eastern coastal region.

    改造工程竣工济南机场复航
    本报济南九月二十五日电  记者贾建舟报道：由济南空军和山东省政府联合投资修建的济南机场改造工程，已竣工复航。今天，一架英制三叉戟飞机在新开辟的“北京——济南——福州航线”上首航成功。
    经过改造的济南机场，不仅使其加入了全国五十七个能起降中型以上客机机场的行列，而且结束了鲁闽两省空中不通航的历史，这为推动山东半岛与闽江三角洲乃至东南沿海地区的经济文化交流提供了方便条件。
