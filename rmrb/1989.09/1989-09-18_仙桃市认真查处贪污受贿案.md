Xiantao City in Hubei Province has prioritized the fight against embezzlement and bribery as a key part of its efforts in building a clean government and conducting economic inspections. From January to August this year, the city has investigated and handled 37 cases involving 47 individuals, recovering stolen funds and items valued at a total of 412,000 yuan.

This year, Xiantao City has focused on major cases based on the characteristics of economic crime leads. The city's procuratorate has allocated 50% of its personnel to specifically handle embezzlement and bribery cases, adopting measures for swift investigation and resolution to improve the quality of case handling. The main accountant of the Agricultural Bank's Zhengchang Branch, Liu Huixia, embezzled 180,000 yuan by falsifying records and destroying evidence. After receiving the report, the procuratorate, in collaboration with the city's Agricultural Bank, conducted a second audit of Liu's accounts, confirmed the facts, and promptly apprehended the fugitive criminal. The city's relevant departments discovered that the deputy director of the city's Textile Factory, Liu Erjiu, had accepted bribes totaling 22,000 yuan. Currently, the suspect has been arrested.

　　仙桃市认真查处贪污受贿案
    湖北省仙桃市把反贪污、反受贿作为廉政建设和经济检查的首要工作来抓，今年1至8月，立案查处贪污受贿案37件47人，追回赃款赃物价值共达41.2万元。
    今年以来，仙桃市根据经济案件线索多的特点，集中优势兵力办大案要案，市检察院抽调50％的干警专门办理贪污、受贿案件，采取快审快办的措施，提高了办案质量。农业银行郑场镇营业所主管会计刘辉华采取虚设货款、毁帐灭据的手段，贪污库款18万多元。检察机关接到报案后，会同市农行对刘所管帐务进行了二次清理，确认事实后迅速抓获外逃的罪犯。市有关部门发现市纺织总厂副厂长刘二九收受贿赂折款共达2.2万多元。目前，该犯已被逮捕。
