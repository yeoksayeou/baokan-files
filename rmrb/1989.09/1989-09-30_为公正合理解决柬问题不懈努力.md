In July and August 1989, an international conference on the Cambodian issue was held in Paris. The Chinese Foreign Minister elaborated on China's stance on politically resolving the Cambodian issue in the new situation at the conference. He expressed support for Prince Sihanouk and ASEAN, as well as many other countries, in seeking a comprehensive and lasting solution. This solution must address the issue of Vietnamese withdrawal under effective international supervision and ensure peace, prevent civil war, and achieve national reconciliation in Cambodia after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

On the issue of withdrawal, China demands that Vietnam withdraw all its armed forces from Cambodia, including military advisors, military personnel hidden in the Cambodian fake army, armed militias among the migrants, and all weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment. China also insists that Vietnam must guarantee that it will not return to Cambodia under any pretext or in any form after withdrawal. To this end, China advocates for the United Nations to play a crucial role in implementing international supervision. Regarding the Cambodian issue, China proposes that after the Vietnamese withdrawal and before the general election, a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk should be established in Cambodia. This government would be responsible for freezing and reducing the four parties' armies and preparing for the future election. Any attempt to allow one party to monopolize power or exclude any party could lead to dangerous situations. The Chinese Foreign Minister also stated that after Vietnam's genuine withdrawal, China would, together with relevant countries, undertake the obligation to stop military aid to all parties in Cambodia. After the establishment of the four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, China would only engage with that government and respect the results of the future election it oversees. China's stance was welcomed by the majority of the representatives of the attending countries.

    为公正合理解决柬问题不懈努力
    1989年七、八月间，关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议在巴黎举行。中国外长在会上全面阐述了中国在新形势下政治解决柬问题的立场，表示支持西哈努克亲王和东盟等许多国家提出的必须寻求一项全面持久的解决办法的主张，既要解决在切实有效的国际监督下越南撤军的问题，又要解决越军撤走后柬在保持和平、防止内战和实现民族和解的问题。
    在撤军问题上，中国要求越南撤走它在柬的全部武装力量，包括军事顾问、隐藏在柬伪军中的军事人员和在移民中的武装民兵，以及全部武器弹药和其它军事装备，并保证撤走后不能以任何借口和任何方式重返柬埔寨。为此，中国主张充分发挥联合国在实施国际监督方面的重要作用。关于柬埔寨的问题，中国主张在越南撤军后到实行大选前的过渡时期，在柬建立一个以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，由联合政府负责对四方军队实行冻结和裁减，并筹组未来的大选，任何企图让一方独家掌权或排除任何一方的做法很可能导致出现危险局势。中国外长还表示，在越南真正撤军后，中国将同有关国家一道承担义务，停止对柬各方的军事援助。在以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府成立后，中国将只同该政府交往，并尊重由它主持的未来大选的结果。中国政府的主张受到大多数与会国代表的欢迎。
