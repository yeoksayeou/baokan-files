Lu Qixi felt that the spring of this year was particularly bright, and he had his reasons. For years, cataracts had been gradually deteriorating the vision of this busy elderly chemist, eventually causing his right eye to become completely blind. In March, Professor Li Meiyu, the head of the ophthalmology department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical University, performed a "capsular extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation" on Mr. Lu. After the bandages were removed, his vision immediately reached 0.9. Subsequent vision tests showed continuous improvement.

Li Meiyu, who is both efficient and very calm, told the reporter that from September 1983 to June 1989, she and her colleagues completed 242 cases of "capsular extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation" on 260 eyes. Among them, 172 eyes were followed up for 1 to 4 years or more. The results were as follows: 95.15% of the corrected vision was above 0.5, and 79.39% was between 1.0 and 1.5. Complications were rare, and the therapeutic effect was stable.

When asking other ophthalmologists about the level of Li Meiyu's surgery, the response was: internationally advanced and domestically leading.

Age-related cataracts are currently the main cause of blindness. Surveys have found that 33.09% of blind people in China are due to cataracts. Currently, there are 4.5 million people with bilateral blindness, and the number of people with unilateral blindness is double that of bilateral blindness. Nationwide, there are more than 100,000 people who have become bilaterally blind due to age-related cataracts.

Li Meiyu, who graduated from Beijing Medical College in 1954, has been engaged in ophthalmic clinical practice for over 30 years. She knows well that there is currently no effective drug treatment for cataracts. The traditional treatment method is to wait for the cataract to mature naturally before removing it. However, after the surgery, the eye is like a camera without a lens, making it difficult to see clearly, and a pair of 1200-degree hyperopic glasses must be worn; the corrected vision obtained from the glasses always has a circular dark area around the edges, causing the image to be distorted and enlarged; if it is a single-eye surgery, the pain is also considerable due to the imbalance in vision between the two eyes.

In recent years, the most advanced treatment for cataracts abroad is the use of capsular extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, which can achieve rapid recovery of vision, normal peripheral vision, and is suitable for single-eye treatment. Li Meiyu thought: China's economic conditions are limited, and we cannot simply copy foreign practices. In recent years, under an old low-magnification microscope, she has been meticulously performing these "capsular extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation" surgeries, using many cost-effective methods. This has attracted the attention of domestic and international colleagues, and the cost of her surgeries is much lower than that of her foreign counterparts. She has been invited to many international conferences to share her experiences.

Now, there are already 6 skilled surgeons in the ophthalmology department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical University who can perform this type of surgery. For this, Li Meiyu, who is 58 years old, feels particularly happy.

    李美玉和人工晶体植入术

    卢嘉锡先生认为今年的春天特别明媚，是有原因的。这些年，白内障在毫无顾忌地吞噬着这位公务和学术活动十分繁忙的老化学家的视力，最后竟使他的右眼完全失明了。3月，北京医科大学第一附属医院眼科主任李美玉教授为卢老做了“白内障囊外摘除伴后房型人工晶体植入术”。术后刚揭开纱布，视力就达到了0.9。随后，每次测视力，都愈来愈好。
    精干而又十分平和的李美玉告诉记者，从1983年9月至1989年6月，她和同事们完成“白内障囊外摘除及后房型人工晶体植入术”242例、260只眼。其中对172只眼做了1至4年以上的随访。效果是：矫正视力在0.5以上者达95.15％，其中1.0至1.5者达79.39％，并发症很少，疗效稳定。
    记者请教别的眼科专家：李美玉的手术属什么水平？回答是：国际先进，国内领先。
    老年性白内障是当前主要致盲的眼病。调查发现，我国的盲人中33.09％是由白内障所致。全国现有双眼盲人450万，单眼盲为双眼盲的一倍。因老年性白内障致双眼盲的，全国现有100多万人。
    1954年毕业于北京医学院的李美玉，经过30多年眼科临床，深知目前还没找到治疗白内障的有效药物。传统的治疗方法是待其自然成熟后摘除。但是，术后的眼睛如同照像机失去了镜头，视物不清，必须配戴1200度的远视眼镜；可从眼镜中获得的矫正视力，周边总有一圈环形暗区，还使物象失真变大；如果是单眼手术，由于两眼视力不平衡，痛苦也不少。
    近几年，国外治疗白内障，最先进的是采用囊外摘除及后房型植入人工晶体术，可以达到迅速恢复视力、周边视野正常、也宜单眼治疗的目的。李美玉想：中国经济条件有限，不能照搬外国的做法。这些年，她在一台旧的低倍显微镜下飞针走线，想许多穷办法完成的一例例“白内障囊外摘除伴后房型人工晶体植入术”，不断引起国内外同行的瞩目，其手术费用远低于国外同行。许多国际会议邀请她去介绍经验。
    如今，北医大一院眼科能娴熟地做这种手术的医师已有6人，为此，58岁的李美玉尤其感到高兴。
