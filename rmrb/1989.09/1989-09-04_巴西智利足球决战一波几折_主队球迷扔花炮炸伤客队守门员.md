Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

The Brazil-Chile football showdown in the South American qualifying round for the World Cup took a dramatic turn. The home team's fans threw a firecracker that injured the away team's goalkeeper.

The third match of Group 3 in the South American qualifying round for the World Cup was played on September 3rd. Brazil won 1-0 against Chile, but the match ended 26 minutes early due to an injury to Chile's goalkeeper. The final result of the match is pending a decision by FIFA.

The match was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Taking advantage of the home field, Brazil scored the first goal in the 49th minute. However, 15 minutes later, a Brazilian fan threw a firecracker into the field, which exploded near Chile's goalkeeper, reportedly injuring him. All of Chile's players on the field returned to the locker room. Twenty minutes later, the referee ended the match.

The FIFA delegation observing the qualifying matches in South America expressed regret over the incident. They believe the outcome of the match should be decided by the FIFA arbitration committee after a meeting.

The first match between Brazil and Chile was held on August 13th in Santiago, Chile, with both teams drawing 1-1. However, due to disturbances caused by Chilean fans, FIFA decided to ban Chile from hosting international matches at their national stadium.

Less than a month later, the two teams faced each other again, and another incident occurred. It seems that every step towards advancing to Italy is not easy.

Before the match, both teams had 5 points, but Brazil had 2 more goals than Chile. Therefore, the winner of this match would advance to Italy.

    巴西智利足球决战一波几折
    主队球迷扔花炮炸伤客队守门员
    新华社北京9月4日电　据外电报道，世界杯足球赛南美区预选赛第三组的比赛3日又赛一场，巴西队以1∶0胜智利队，但这场比赛因智利队守门员受伤而提前26分钟结束，所以比赛结果是否有效还有待于国际足联的最后裁决。
    这场比赛是在巴西的里约热内卢进行的，巴西队占主场之利，第49分钟时首开纪录，但15分钟以后，巴西一球迷向场内投掷了一个花炮，正好在智利队守门员身旁爆炸，据说致使这位守门员受伤，智利队场上队员全部回到了休息室。20分钟后，这场比赛的主裁判宣布比赛结束。
    国际足联赴南美观看预选赛的代表团对这次事件表示遗憾，他们认为这场比赛的结果须待国际足联仲裁委员会开会研究决定。
    巴西队和智利队的第一场比赛是8月13日在智利首都圣地亚哥举行的，双方以1∶1踢平，但在这场球赛中，由于智利球迷闹事，致使国际足联决定不许智利队在国家体育场参加国际比赛。
    事隔不到一个月，两队的比赛又出乱子，看来向意大利进军的每一步都不容易。
    这场比赛前两队的积分都是5分，但巴西队比智利队的净胜球多两个，所以谁能赢得这场比赛谁就能进军意大利。
