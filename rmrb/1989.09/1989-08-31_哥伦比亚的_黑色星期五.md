On August 18, the police chief of Antioquia Province, Colonel Kindro, and a prominent politician from the ruling party, Galan, were assassinated in Medellin and Bogota respectively. This event shook Colombia and the international community, and people referred to that day as "Black Friday."

In recent times, drug trafficking organizations in Colombia have launched a wave of assassinations. They hire assassins and paramilitary groups to kill political figures, judges, and police officers, attempting to obstruct the Colombian government's anti-drug operations and judicial investigations, and to force the government into "dialogue." In Medellin, where drug traffickers are most active, the provincial governor Betancur and a female judge were assassinated. On August 16, Judge Carlos Valencia of the High Court of Cundinamarca was shot dead in the center of Bogota. The direct cause was likely his insistence on summoning the head of the international drug trafficking organization, Escobar. After Valencia's assassination, a large number of judges submitted their resignations, and courts across the country began an indefinite strike, demanding that the government take effective measures to protect the safety of court personnel and their families. Unfortunately, this wave had not yet subsided when Kindro and Galan were assassinated.

Galan was a rising star in the Liberal Party, 46 years old this year. Last year, his faction cooperated with the mainstream faction within the party to once again seek the party's presidential nomination. According to the latest public opinion poll, Galan was the candidate with the highest nomination support. Galan was firm in his stance against drugs, advocating for the restoration of Colombia's agreement with the United States to extradite drug traffickers. This agreement is a major taboo for drug traffickers and a sensitive issue within Colombia. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that the agreement was unconstitutional, blocking its implementation. Galan's stance on this issue naturally drew the ire of the drug trafficking organizations. According to the police, the Medellin drug trafficking organization had offered a $500,000 bounty for Galan's head. Therefore, Galan's death is generally believed to have been orchestrated by drug traffickers.

The drug trafficking organizations' atrocities have sparked great indignation across Colombian society and have prompted the government to redouble its efforts to combat drug trafficking. President Barco announced the restoration of the extradition agreement with the United States, giving the executive branch the authority to hand over captured drug traffickers to U.S. authorities without judicial approval. President Barco also announced the seizure of drug traffickers' assets, aiming to strike at the economic foundation of the drug trafficking organizations. Following "Black Friday," the military and police launched an unprecedented large-scale search and seizure operation, expanding from the capital Bogota to the tropical forests bordering Ecuador. The Minister of Defense announced on the 21st that the military and police had arrested 11,000 suspicious individuals, seized dozens of airplanes and helicopters, hundreds of vehicles, and confiscated 4 tons of cocaine. The military also raided the luxurious residences of the heads of the Medellin drug trafficking organization in Bogota and Medellin.

The wave of assassinations has already affected Colombia's political landscape. Some presidential candidates seeking nomination have expressed that, given the current situation, election activities should be suspended for a while. Regarding the drug trafficking organizations' demand for dialogue, the government has clearly refused, but some political figures have suggested considering this request.

In summary, combating the arrogance of drug trafficking organizations has become the most important political issue in Colombia, a matter of life and death for the country and its democratic institutions.

    哥伦比亚的“黑色星期五”
    本报记者　朱满庭
    8月18日，哥伦比亚安提奥基亚省警察局局长金德罗上校和执政党内争取总统候选人提名的著名政治家加兰先后在麦德林市和波哥大市遇刺身亡。这极大地震动了哥伦比亚和国际社会，人们把这一天称为“黑色的星期五”。
    最近一个时期，哥伦比亚贩毒集团掀起一股暗杀浪潮，他们以重金雇佣杀手和准军事组织刺杀政要、法官和警官，妄图阻止哥伦比亚当局的扫毒行动和司法调查，迫使政府与之
  “对话”。在贩毒集团出没最多的麦德林市，省总督贝坦库尔和一名女法官先后遇刺。8月16日，昆迪纳马卡省高级法院的法官卡洛斯·瓦伦西亚也被人射杀于波哥大市中心。其直接原因可能是他坚持要传讯国际贩毒集团头目埃斯科瓦尔。瓦伦西亚遇刺后，大批法官呈递辞职书，全国法院开始不定期罢工；要求政府采取有效措施保护法院办案人员和家属的人身安全。不料，这一风波尚未平息，金德罗和加兰又先后遇刺。
    加兰是自由党内的后起之秀，今年46岁。去年，他领导的派别与党内主流派合作，再次争取党内总统候选人提名。据最近一次民意调查，加兰是提名呼声最高的人选。加兰在反对毒品问题上态度坚决，主张恢复哥伦比亚向美国引渡毒品贩子的协定。这个协定是贩毒分子的一个大忌，也是哥伦比亚国内有争议的一个敏感问题。
    1987年，全国最高法庭宣布此协定不合宪法，阻止了协定的执行。加兰在这个问题上的主张自然招致贩毒集团的忌恨。据警方透露，麦德林贩毒集团曾悬偿50万美金，买加兰的人头。因此，加兰之死一般认为肯定是贩毒分子策划的。
    贩毒集团的暴行激起了哥伦比亚各界的极大义愤，也促使政府下更大的决心打击贩毒活动。巴尔科总统宣布恢复哥美之间的引渡协定，即行政当局有权不经司法当局的批准将抓获的贩毒分子交给美国当局处理。巴尔科总统还宣布没收贩毒分子的财产，从经济上打击贩毒集团。星期五之后，军方和警方已开展了规模空前的搜捕和查抄行动，行动范围从首都波哥大一直扩展到与厄瓜多尔交界的热带密林。国防部长于21日宣布，三军和警察已逮捕1.1万名可疑分子，没收了数十架飞机和直升机、数百辆汽车，查获到4吨可卡因。军方还在波哥大、麦德林抄查了麦德林贩毒集团头目的豪华住宅。
    暗杀浪潮已对哥伦比亚政局产生影响。一些正在争取提名的总统候选人已表示在目前的形势下竞选活动应暂停一下。在贩毒集团要求的对话问题上，政府方面已明确拒绝，但有些政界人士表示应考虑这个要求。
    总之，打击贩毒集团的嚣张气焰已成为哥伦比亚当前最重要的政治课题，成了关系国家和民主制度生死存亡的大事。
