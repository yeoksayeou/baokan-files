Dalian Seizes "Idle Houses" to Allocate to Disadvantaged Households

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, September 1 (Correspondent Wang Yonghai, Reporter Li Xiaolin) Dalian City has taken effective measures to clear up excess housing, and so far, 111 units of long-term unoccupied "idle houses" have been seized and confiscated by the Dalian Municipal Bureau of Real Estate Administration. These houses will be allocated to "disadvantaged households," and some disadvantaged households have already moved into their new homes.

Dalian City currently has over 5,000 disadvantaged households and households without housing. In early August, the Dalian Municipal Bureau of Real Estate Administration, following the instructions of the municipal government, first sealed off 26 units of "idle houses." The bureau also called on citizens to continue reporting "idle houses." If anyone tries to intervene or obstruct, regardless of their position, they will be publicly exposed in the newspapers. For those with serious offenses, disciplinary actions will be taken.
