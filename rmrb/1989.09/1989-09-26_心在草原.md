The vast and beautiful Keerqin grassland, in the golden light of a summer sunset, stretches out like an endless green sea. It is just as I had dreamed it would be! I roll endlessly in the soft, green grass, stand up, and with arms outstretched, shout, “I embrace you, Keerqin!” But who is truly embracing whom? You are far more expansive than my heart, more boundless than my unrestrained thoughts. You possess a mysterious, open truth, and something more. What is it? Suddenly, I feel as though I am melting into you, becoming a tiny point within the heart of a Saijirang flower, beneath a tiny umbrella of a Babading. I also feel as though I am being gently lifted, rising above, with no mountains to block my way, no city noise to disturb me, only the wind and butterflies.

Let me tell you, I am a mountain person. My home is a very prosperous and charming place. It produces ginseng, black bears, heroes, as well as “bearded men” and myths. My pride is evident, and I never mind the gaze of city people. The world outside the mountains is vast, and I began to experience this at the age of 17 when I left the mountains to explore the world. I worked in the fields of the Northeast, carried a gun on an island. Before reaching the age of 30, I boldly stepped onto the lecture platform of one of the country’s top universities, challenging scholars with my stubbornness. People in Beijing say this is how I build my courage. How? With the wild spirit of a young bull, relying on the mountains. Deep down, the mountains have always been behind us.

When I came from the mountains to the city on the Songliao Plain, I brought with me a surge of wild energy, accompanied by a sense of loss. Thank you, life. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come to Keerqin with a writers’ group, to spend time with you, even if it’s just for a few days, too brief to fully appreciate, yet so meaningful and lingering in my dreams. The insights you’ve given me are so subtle and unique, making me both surprised and deeply at ease.

Do you remember the girl with the small fang? She is charming, and her smile is like the openness of the grassland. Honestly, I would rather give her your name, Keerqin, Keerqin’s daughter, what a beautiful name.

“Have you seen mountains?” I began to boast. The girl shook her head seriously, expressing regret, and looked at me enviously. “I imagine, very high and steep mountains, I stand on the top, look down, oh my, I’m scared!” I was proud.

“Do you like our grassland?” She had already merged Keerqin with herself, I realized.

“The grassland stretches endlessly, and when you first come here, it feels empty and vast, making you feel unsteady.” I spoke as profoundly as I could. The girl laughed heartily, and I couldn’t take my eyes off the small fang at the corner of her lips. Unintentionally, I was defeated by the girl. I suddenly realized my own shallowness.

The girl’s perspective is that of a grassland person, unobstructed, thinking of mountains means “standing on the top.” While the perspective of a mountain person, or rather, my perspective, is at the foot of the mountain, surrounded by mountains, feeling secure, but unable to see beyond. Once on the grassland, with nothing to rely on, I feel “unstable.” Two perspectives, two feelings, indicating two different attitudes.

I really want to turn back, find that girl deep in the grassland, say thank you to her, and loudly proclaim my love, letting the voice echo across the grassland, reaching the mountains and the grassland, vast and profound.

Keerqin, your boundless green allure has given me another insight. As soon as I came to this vast grassland, I wanted to run freely in all directions, towards the horizon. The horizon is still in the distance. We can expend all our life’s energy, but we can never reach the end. I wonder if this is a desire for pursuit and a struggle with the limits of life?

Keerqin grassland, we fell in love at first sight. My heart, that of a mountain person, has been left on the grassland.

    心在草原
    张目                        
    科尔沁大草原，你真辽阔，你真美。你在夏日的夕阳里，绿海无际，又镀上一道金边，你就和我梦中见到的一样啊！我在软若碧毯的草丛里没完没了地打着滚儿，又站起来，张开双臂高喊：“我拥抱你，科尔沁！”可究竟是谁在拥抱谁呢？你毕竟比我的胸襟，比我放纵于情思的心性更无垠，更有一种坦荡如谛的神秘，更多了一些什么。什么呢？我忽然觉着我被你融化了，融化成一个虚点，在萨日朗花心，在婆婆丁小伞下。我又觉得被你轻轻地托起，上升，没有山的阻隔，没有都市的喧闹，只有风和蝴蝶。
    跟你说，我是山里人，我的家是一个很富庶很有魅力的地方。出人参、出黑熊、出英雄，也出“胡子”和神话。我的自豪感溢于言表，为此我从不顾忌都市人的目光。山外的世界很大，这在我17岁那年出山闯世界就开始领教了。北大荒抡锄，海岛上扛枪。还在而立之年，大着胆子闯进一所国内最高学府的讲台上，和那些学富五车的学者们拔犟眼子。北京人说我这是练胆儿。凭的什么？就是初生牛犊不怕虎的野劲，凭着对山的依赖。在心理深层，山始终靠在我们身后。
    我从山里来到坐落在松辽平原上的城市，亦是带着勃勃欲起的野劲，伴随着的，当然也有一种怅然若失。感谢生活。感谢生活给了我机缘，随着一个作家团来到科尔沁，与你相处，哪怕只有几日，短得来不及细细体味，却是那么意蕴悠长，梦绕魂牵。你给我的启示是那么细微、独特，使我暗暗吃惊，也使我深深释然。
    你还记得那个长着一颗小虎牙的女孩儿吗？她很迷人，笑也是草原的一切都袒露给你的那种。说真的，我更愿意把你的名字送给她，科尔沁，科尔沁女儿，多漂亮的名字。
      “你见过山吗？”我开始炫耀。女孩儿极认真地摇头，表示出遗憾，她羡慕地看着我。“我想象，好高好陡的山，我站在顶上，往下一瞅，哎哟我害怕！”我得意了。
      “你喜欢我们大草原吗？”她其实已经把科尔沁和自己融为一体了，我发觉。
      “大草原一眼望不到边，乍来这，四下空空旷旷的，有一种站不住的感觉。”我说得尽量玄一些。女孩儿格格笑个不停，让我的眼神舍不得离开那唇边的小虎牙。无意中我被女孩儿击败了。我猛然意识到自己的浅薄。
    女孩儿着眼的是草原人的视角，没有遮拦，想到山，就想到会“站在顶上”。而山区人的视角，确切地说是我的视角，是在山脚下，四面靠山，心里踏实，但望不出去。一到草原，无所依傍，便有“站不住”的感觉。两个视角，两种感受，表明了两种心态。
    我真想回转身去，在大草原深处找到那女孩儿，说我谢谢你，还大声说我爱你，让声音回荡在草原上，传得更远，让山区和草原紧紧相接，辽阔且深邃。
    科尔沁，你无边的绿色诱惑还给了我另一种启示。一来到这大草原，就想四下里尽情地奔跑，朝着地平线。地平线仍是在远方。我们可以拚尽人生全部气力，却总也跑不到边。我想起这是不是一种追求的渴望和生命的极限的搏斗呢？
    科尔沁大草原，我们一见钟情，我的一颗山里人的心已经留在了草原上。
