    China's livestock and poultry farming has rapidly developed and has become a relatively independent industry.

    According to a report from the Ministry of Agriculture, China's total meat production is expected to reach approximately 25 million tons this year, and the annual egg production is expected to reach 7.04 million tons. With these figures, China's egg production will rank first in the world, and meat production will rank second.

    Livestock and poultry farming is an industry that has developed rapidly in China since liberation, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Currently, there are 1,370 livestock and poultry breeding farms, 12 forage seed production bases, and over 110 feed monitoring stations equipped with relatively advanced testing equipment nationwide. The country's feed processing capacity has exceeded 20 million tons.

    Since the mid-1970s, the exploration of modern poultry and pig farming has played a positive role in increasing China's egg and meat production. At present, 419 livestock and poultry commercial production bases have been established nationwide. There are more than 900,000 specialized households engaged in livestock and poultry production, and over 4,400 various livestock and poultry economic cooperatives. Since the 1980s, significant progress has been made in the construction of the Northeast dairy cow belt, the Central Plains beef cattle belt, and large-scale waterfowl bases in the south.

    It is reported that by the end of this year, China's pig inventory will reach 338 million heads, large livestock inventory will reach 127 million heads, and poultry will reach 2.27 billion. The per capita livestock product ownership level is: 22.5 kilograms of meat, 6.3 kilograms of eggs, and 3.6 kilograms of dairy products. Overall, livestock farming is no longer just a component of agriculture's "secondary industry" but has become a relatively independent and vibrant industry within agriculture.

    我国畜禽养殖迅速发展
    已成为相对独立的产业
    本报讯　记者陈健从农业部获悉：今年我国肉类总产量预计可达2500万吨左右，禽蛋年产量可达704万吨左右。这样，我国的禽蛋年产量将跃居世界第一，肉类总产量居世界第二位。
    畜禽养殖业是我国解放以来，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以来发展颇为迅速的一个产业。现在全国已有各种畜禽良种场1370个、牧草种子生产基地12个，拥有较先进的检测设备的饲料监测站110多个，全国生产加工饲料的能力已超过2000万吨。
    从70年代中期开始进行的现代化养鸡养猪探索，对提高我国禽蛋和肉类产出量起到了积极的作用。目前，全国已建成畜禽商品生产基地419个。从事畜禽生产的专业户超过90万个，各类畜牧经济联合体达4400多个。80年代以来，东北奶牛带、中原肉牛带及南方大片水禽基地建设都取得了明显效果。
    据介绍，今年年末我国生猪存栏可达3.38亿头，大牲畜存栏可达1.27亿头，家禽可达22.7亿只。人均畜产品占有水平为：肉类22.5公斤，禽蛋6.3公斤，奶类3.6公斤。畜牧业从整体上讲已不再是农业的“副业”的一个组成部分，而成为一个相对独立的、农业中富于生机的产业之一。
