Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, and Wu Xueqian met with all participants of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade's conference for counselors and consuls from some overseas regions this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. They listened to their reports.

After listening to the reports, Premier Li Peng emphasized that the economic sanctions imposed by some Western countries have brought us some difficulties. However, we have the confidence to overcome these difficulties, withstand external pressures, and open up a new situation in foreign economic and trade work.

Li Peng said that foreign economic and trade work is an important front. During this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the vast majority of overseas economic and trade cadres have performed well and passed the test. Overall, the overseas economic and trade team is a good team. He hopes that all comrades on the economic and trade front will improve their quality, be proficient not only in their business but also politically firm, and safeguard the interests of the Party and the state.

Premier Li Peng pointed out that we should be soberly aware that the strategy of "peaceful evolution" by some Western countries towards China has not changed, and the struggle against subversion and infiltration is long-term. At present, we must pay special attention to studying new problems in the new situation and establish the confidence to overcome difficulties. As long as our political situation is stable and the economy is developing, and we continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up and independent and peaceful foreign policy, our foreign work and foreign economic and trade work will definitely be able to overcome temporary difficulties and open up a new situation.

Li Peng said that our foreign economic and trade work must be significantly improved. We should make full use of existing conditions to restore and develop foreign trade and economic and technological cooperation to serve the Four Modernizations. We must emphasize credibility, honor contracts, improve the quality of export products, and reduce production costs.

Vice Premier Yao Yilin also spoke after listening to the reports. He said that we have suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and strategically, this is a great victory for us, but we have also encountered temporary difficulties. Comrades engaged in foreign economic and trade work should have a full understanding of the situation, and it is better to estimate the difficulties more and for a longer time, so that we will not be passive. Secondly, we must establish the confidence to overcome difficulties and actively carry out work. If we do a good job, we will be able to attract more investment and increase more exports.

The six-day conference for counselors and consuls from some overseas regions mainly aims to further study the relevant documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, sort out thoughts, improve understanding, and study how to open up a new situation in China's foreign economic and trade work.

    李鹏姚依林听取部分参赞领事汇报后强调
    我们有信心克服困难顶住压力
    开拓对外经济贸易工作新局面
    新华社北京9月7日电  （记者陈芸、陈铭）国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林、田纪云、吴学谦今天下午在中南海会见了出席经贸部驻外部分地区参赞、领事工作会议的全体同志，并听取了他们的汇报。
    李鹏总理在听取汇报后强调说，一些西方国家对我国的经济制裁，给我们带来一些困难，但是，我们有信心克服这些困难，顶住外来压力，开拓对外经济贸易的新局面。
    李鹏说，对外经济贸易工作是一条重要的战线，在这次动乱和反革命暴乱中，绝大多数驻外经济贸易干部表现是好的，经受住了考验。总的来看，驻外经贸队伍是一支好的队伍。他希望经贸战线上的全体同志，提高素质，不仅在业务上要精通，而且在政治上要坚定，维护党和国家的利益。
    李鹏总理指出，我们应该清醒地看到，某些西方国家对我国实行“和平演变”的战略没有改变，颠覆与反颠覆、渗透与反渗透的斗争是长期的。当前要特别注意研究新形势下的新问题，树立克服困难的信心。只要我们的政局是稳定的，经济是发展的，继续坚持改革开放和独立自主的和平外交政策，我们的对外工作，对外经济贸易工作，就一定能克服暂时困难，开拓新的局面。
    李鹏说，我们的对外经济贸易工作，必须有一个较大的改进，充分利用现有的条件，恢复和发展对外贸易和经济技术合作，为四化建设服务。要强调重信誉，守合同，提高出口产品质量，降低生产成本。
    姚依林副总理在听取汇报后也讲了话。他说，我们平息了反革命暴乱，从战略上讲，这是我们的一大胜利，但也遇到了暂时困难。从事对外经济贸易工作的同志，一要对形势有充分的估计，宁肯把困难估计的多一些，时间长一些，这样我们就不会陷于被动；二要树立克服困难的信心，积极开展工作。如果把工作做好了，我们就有可能多争取一些投资，多增加一些出口。
    为期六天的驻外部分地区参赞、领事工作会议，主要是进一步学习党的十三届四中全会有关文件，清理思想，提高认识，研究如何开拓我国对外经济贸易的新局面。
