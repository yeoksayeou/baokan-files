Dear Brother Shíqǐncún,

I have read several times the article you published in the fourth issue of _New Literary Materials_ last year, "Clouds and Rain over Yunnan: Reminiscences of From-File." I found it to be quite well-written, the best among the reminiscences and eulogies of St. From-File that I have read since his passing.

I recall telling you that over the years, whenever I went to Beijing to visit Mr. From-File, he would always instruct me, "When you return to Shanghai, please convey my greetings to Ba Jin and Shíqǐncún." This was almost without exception. This shows his deep affection for you. Conversely, your feelings for him are also very sincere, so your understanding of him surpasses that of ordinary people. In "Clouds and Rain over Yunnan: Reminiscences of From-File," apart from the first half, which vividly describes your interactions in Shanghai and Yunnan, especially the times you both frequented the street stalls on Fúzhào Street in Kunming, I particularly appreciate the second half, where you discuss his works and his way of dealing with people. For example, regarding the realism of his works and his style; regarding how he became a "local gentleman" and a cautious "Beijing School" writer due to his long-term association with a group of professors and scholars; regarding his relationship with left-wing writers and the influence of reformism, I believe you have brought up points that others have not, or have not dared to. I think your impartial and truthful comments are truly insightful. Your view that he was once a "local gentleman" also reminds me of my actual feelings from that time, that is, during the 1930s in Beijing, in the few times we interacted, I also found that although he associated with some professors and scholars, he always had a unique "rustic" quality. I always feel that regardless of who the person is, whether they are a friend or not, whether their views are the same or different, whether they are deceased or alive, one should maintain an objective attitude, neither intentionally exaggerating nor deliberately defaming, saying what needs to be said. I think your article largely achieves this.

After learning of St. From-File's passing, last July, I also wrote a reminiscence during the intense heat, titled "A Kind Person, Not a Lonely Writer," which was published in the first issue of _Essays_ this year. His situation was lonely, but how could a writer who produced so many works with a unique style, who had a large number of readers, and who received attention from both domestic and international circles, be lonely? Those who are truly lonely should be the "empty-headed literary figures" that Lu Xun spoke of. You are his good friend, and I was only a junior who received his mentorship in the early 1930s. Our positions are different, and our perspectives vary. You can say things that I cannot, or should not. Reading your article has indeed benefited me greatly. After my strength fully recovers, I will visit you with my wife. The weather is getting warmer, take care.

Yours sincerely,
Wáng Xīyàn

### 既不溢美，也不贬损

    ·王西彦致施蛰存·
    既不溢美，也不贬损蛰存兄：
    您那篇发表在《新文学史料》去年第四期上的《滇云浦雨话从文》，我拜读过几遍，觉得的确写得不错，是沈从文逝世后我所读到的回忆悼念文章中最好的一篇。
    记得我曾告诉过您，这些年来，每次去北京看望从文先生，告辞时他总要嘱咐我：“回上海给我问候巴金、蛰存。”几无例外。这说明他对您的深挚感情。反过来看，您对他的感情也很真诚，所以您对他的理解也超出一般人。在《滇云浦雨话从文》里，除了前半篇记述你们在沪滇两地互相交往特别是在昆明共跑福照街地摊的情景，写得极其亲切细致而外，我最欣赏的是后半篇您对他作品和为人处世的看法，例如关于他作品的现实性和文体；关于他因和一群教授学者长期来往，成为一个“土绅士”和谨小慎微的“京派”文人；关于他和左翼作家的关系，并联系到所受改良主义影响等等，我以为都发人之所未发，或不便发、不敢发的。我觉得，您这种公允而符合实情的评议，就是真知灼见。关于他曾是一个“土绅士”的看法，也使我回忆起当年的实际感受，就是三十年代北平时期，在彼此次数不多的接触中，我也发现他虽然和一些教授学者相处，但在他身上总有一种独特的“乡下人”的气质。我总觉得，无论对待什么人，是朋友或非朋友，是见解相同或相异，是已故或健在的，都应该持客观态度，既不存心溢美，也不故意贬损，有什么就说什么。您这篇文章我以为是大体上做到了这一点的。
    得到沈从文逝世消息后，去年七月间，我也曾冒大暑写过一篇回忆文章，题为《宽厚的人，并非孤寂的作家》，发表在今年第一期《随笔》上。他的处境孤寂，其实，像他那样写了那么多具备独特风格的好作品的作家，拥有大量的读者，受到国内外的关怀，怎么会孤寂呢？真正孤寂的，应该是另一些没有什么作品光会赶热闹的鲁迅所说的“空头文学家”。您是他的好友，我于三十年代初和他交往时只是一个受他提携的后辈，彼此地位不同，角度各异，您能说的我却不能说，不便说。读了您的文章，的确使我受益极大。等到体力完全恢复后，我将和老伴一起去看您。气候渐暖，多多保重。
                        王西彦　1989.4.10．
