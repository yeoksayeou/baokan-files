Title: Making a Big Deal Out of the "Create" Character

In recent years, there has been much discussion about the "create" character. Cultural and artistic circles talk about "create," and so do the economic circles. Terms like innovation, achievements, brand creation, excellence, and revenue generation are everywhere, not to mention the term "create foreign exchange," which, despite some experts' objections, is still widely used.

The term "create foreign exchange," regardless of its origin, is generally considered "appropriate" by most people. It is explicitly stated that China's export trade should emphasize the "create" character and make a big deal out of it. The reasons are not only because the export market is overseas, with foreign consumers, and each foreign exchange earned indeed requires a creative spirit, but also because China's export trade faces a daunting task. On one hand, China's modernization construction is short of foreign exchange and urgently needs to develop exports. On the other hand, China's resources and exportable goods are quite scarce, restricting exports. Under these dual pressures of scarcity, maintaining steady and continuous growth in exports requires even more creative spirit. This year has been particularly challenging for China's export trade. By the end of August, the national export volume grew by 2.8% compared to the same period last year, far below the average annual growth rate of the past decade. At this critical juncture, officials and workers in the foreign trade and economic departments also need to make a big deal out of the "create" character to overcome the difficulties.

To "create" means to fully utilize intelligence and creativity, to work hard, to think of more ways, to find more channels, and to create more foreign exchange.

A foreign industrialist once pointed out that Chinese export goods have a "more of the low-end, less of the high-end" problem. For example, there are more low-end goods and fewer mid-to-high-end goods; more traditional goods and fewer innovative goods; more primary products and fewer deep-processed goods, and so on. China is one of the world's largest producers of bicycles, sewing machines, ceramics, clocks, electric fans, and a few processed products, but the export volume is very small. Similarly, for textiles, ceramic crafts, and light industrial products, Chinese goods sell at lower prices overseas, and some goods are even only one-tenth the price of other countries' sales. The reason is that our goods are of low quality, and some goods have not changed in decades, making them unwelcome in overseas markets. This "more of the low-end, less of the high-end" is both our export weakness and the potential for creating foreign exchange. Tapping into these potentials requires different levels of effort. If every industry, from top to bottom, focuses on deepening reforms, optimizing the export goods structure, and product development and upgrading, and makes a big deal out of the "create" character, then our export trade will usher in a new situation.

Recently, a colleague told me that a county in Jiangsu Province has focused on the "create" character, and in the first eight months of this year, its foreign exchange earnings grew by over 30% compared to the same period last year. If a county can achieve this, provinces, cities, and enterprises with similar conditions can also do the same.

    在“创”字上大作文章
    路华
    近几年来，谈“创”字的很多。文化艺术界人士谈“创”，经济界人士也谈“创”，什么创新、创举、创牌子、创优、创收，等等，不胜枚举。就是出口收汇，人们也称之谓“创汇”，尽管不少行家对此提出过异议，但至今仍广为用之。
      “创汇”一词，不管出自何人何时，但绝大多数人以为用得“贴切”。而且明确提出，我国出口贸易要突出一个“创”字，在“创”字上大作文章。其原因不独因为出口贸易的市场远在海外，消费者是外国人，每收入一笔外汇确实需要创造精神，还在于我国出口贸易任重道远。一方面，我国现代化建设外汇不足，亟待发展出口，另一方面，我国资源和适销出口商品又相当紧缺，出口受到制约，在这两种短缺压力下保持出口持续稳定增长，更需要创造精神。今年，又是我国出口贸易困难的一年，截至8月底，全国出口额比去年同期增长2.8％，远低于近10年来年平均增长速度，此时此情，经贸部门干部和职工也需要在“创”字上大作文章，闯过难关。
    创，就是充分发挥聪明才智，艰苦创业，多想办法，多找门路，多创汇。
    有位海外工业界人士曾提出，中国出口商品存在“十多十少”问题，如低档商品多，中、高档商品少；传统一贯制商品多，创新商品少；初级产品多，深加工产品少，等等。我国自行车、缝纫机、陶瓷、钟表、电风扇和少数加工产品产量名列世界生产大国，出口量却很小。同样是纺织品、陶瓷工艺品、轻工产品，我国商品在海外销售价较低，有些商品甚至仅是其他国家售出价的1／10。究其原因，就是我们的商品档次低，有些商品几十年一个面孔，海外消费者不欢迎。这“十多十少”，既是我们出口的薄弱点，又是我们创汇的潜力所在。挖掘这些潜力，有些是不用费多大劲，有些要花大气力。如果各行各业，上下一致，紧紧抓住深化改革，优化出口商品结构，产品开发和升级换代工作，在“创”字上作好文章，那么，我们的出口贸易就会出现一个新的局面。
    最近，有位同志告诉我，江苏有个县在“创”字上下了功夫，今年前8个月出口创汇比去年同期增长30％以上。一个县能办到的事，条件差不多的省、市和企业同样有可能办到。
