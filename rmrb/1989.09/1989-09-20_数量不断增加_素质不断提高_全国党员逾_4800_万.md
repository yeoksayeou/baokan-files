In the 40 years since the founding of New China, the Communist Party of China has not only seen a continuous increase in the number of its members but has also insisted on strict party governance, gradually improving the quality of its members. This has enabled the broad ranks of party members to fully play their vanguard and exemplary role in the socialist revolution and construction.

According to information from the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, the number of Communist Party members in the country has grown from nearly 4.5 million at the time of the founding of the nation to over 48 million today. The number of grassroots party organizations has increased from about 200,000 at the time of the founding of the nation to nearly 3 million today.

The proportion of workers in the party membership has significantly increased. By the end of 1988, the number of worker party members had reached 7.97 million, which is 71.2 times the number in 1949. The proportion of worker party members in the total membership has increased from 2.5% in 1949 to 17%.

The cultural and scientific knowledge level of the party membership has also greatly improved. According to statistics, by the end of 1988, there were over 14.8 million party members with a high school education or above, accounting for 30.4% of the total membership, an increase of 362 times compared to 1949.

Our party has always insisted on strict party governance, and this has been the case since the founding of New China. Currently, party organizations at all levels are focusing on party building to further enhance the party's cohesion and combat effectiveness.

To strengthen the education and supervision of party members and party leaders, party organizations at all levels have insisted on the system of democratic life meetings and democratic appraisal of party members. At the same time, party organizations at all levels have strictly enforced party discipline and seriously dealt with unqualified party members. During the "Cultural Revolution," 130,000 unqualified party members who were hastily admitted were expelled. Since the start of the rectification in 1983, more than 130,000 unqualified party members have been expelled. In the past two years, more than 60,000 party members have been persuaded to retire or expelled from the party during the democratic appraisal of party members.

　　数量不断增加　素质不断提高
　　全国党员逾4800万
    据新华社北京9月19日电  （记者孙本尧、胡清海）新中国成立四十年来，中国共产党在党员数量不断增加的同时，坚持从严治党，逐步提高党员素质，使广大党员在社会主义革命和建设中充分发挥了先锋模范作用。
    记者从中共中央组织部获悉，全国共产党员已由建国初的近450万人发展到今天的4800多万人，基层党组织由建国初的约20万个发展到今天的近300万个。
    在党员队伍中工人成份明显增加。到1988年底，工人党员已发展到797万人，相当于1949年的71.2倍。工人党员在党员队伍中的比重由1949年的2.5％增加到17％。
    党员队伍的文化科学知识水平也有很大提高。据统计，1988年底全国党员中具有高中以上文化程度的有1480多万人，占党员总数的30.4％，比1949年增长362倍。
    我们党历来坚持从严治党，新中国成立后也是如此。现在，各级党组织正在聚精会神地抓党的建设，以进一步提高党的凝聚力和战斗力。
    为了加强对党员和党员领导干部的教育与监督，各级党组织坚持了民主生活会制度和民主评议党员活动。与此同时，各级党组织严格执行党的纪律，对不合格党员进行了严肃处理。对“文革”中突击发展的13万名不合格党员作了除名处理。1983年开始的整党中有13万多不合格党员被开除党籍。近两年，民主评议党员中劝退和除名出党的有6万多人。
