The following is a discussion on the charming place names of Taiwan. The author, Peng Huanxie, provides a poetic and descriptive overview of various locations on the island, highlighting their natural beauty and cultural significance.

The couplet "绿岛阳明山，花坛景美；秀水日月潭，莺歌爱河" is like a scroll of vibrant spring scenery and a poem of budding romance. In fact, this couplet is a collection of place names in Taiwan. "绿岛" (Green Island) is located off the coast of Taitung, known for its scenic beauty and is a popular tourist destination. "阳明山" (Yangmingshan) is in Taipei City, surrounded by green mountains and hot springs.

"花坛" (Huatan) Township belongs to Changhua County. "景美" (Jingmei) District is part of Taipei City. "秀水" (Xiushui) Township also belongs to Changhua County.

"日月潭" (Sun Moon Lake) is located in Nantou County, surrounded by mountains, lush with flowers and trees, and the lake water is a deep blue. It is a popular tourist spot and is considered one of the "Eight Scenic Views of Taiwan." "莺歌" (Yingge) Town belongs to Taipei County. "爱河" (Love River) is in Kaohsiung City.

Taiwan, historically known as "夷州" (Yizhou), "琉球" (Liuqiu), "东蕃" (Dongfan), and "大员" (Dayuan), is now also called "宝岛" (Treasure Island) for its abundant resources, "春岛" (Spring Island) for its eternal spring-like climate, "蓬莱岛" (Penglai Island) for its paradise-like setting, "海棠岛" (Sea Buckthorn Island) for its shape resembling a sea buckthorn leaf, "蝴蝶岛" (Butterfly Island) for its abundance of butterflies, "瑚珊岛" (Coral Island) for its rich coral reefs, and "甜岛" (Sweet Island) for its sugar cane production. Over four hundred years ago, European colonizers named Taiwan "福摩萨" (Formosa), meaning "Beautiful Island." The beauty of the island matches its beautiful name, perhaps because a beautiful place deserves a beautiful name.

Taiwan has many more beautiful place names!

"香山杨梅" (Xiangshan Yangmei), "清水花莲" (Qingshui Hualien), "草屯佳冬大雅" (Caotun Jiadong Daya);
"芬园秀林" (Fenyuan Xiulin), "芳苑牡丹" (Fangyuan Mudan), "兰屿恒春美浓" (Lanyu Hengchun Meinong).

This classical-style scenic couplet is composed of fourteen place names in Taiwan, each with its unique charm and beauty, offering poetic inspiration and aesthetic enjoyment. This also reflects, from a cultural perspective, how the profound and extensive traditional Chinese culture has nurtured Taiwan's civilization.

　　宝岛地名趣谈
    彭焕侠
    绿岛阳明山，花坛景美；
    秀水日月潭，莺歌爱河。
    这副对联简直是一卷春意盎然的画、一首恋心萌动的诗。
    其实这副对联是台湾地名的荟萃。“绿岛”，在台东海面，风光旖旎，为观光胜地。“阳明山”在台北市内，青山四合，温泉喷涌。
  “花坛”乡属彰化县。“景美”区属台北市。“秀水”乡属彰化县。
  “日月潭”在南投县内，群山环抱，花木扶疏，潭水湛蓝，游人如织，为“台湾八景”之冠。“莺歌”镇属台北县。“爱河”在高雄市内。
    台湾，史称“夷州”、“琉球”、
  “东蕃”、“大员”，如今又称“宝岛”（物华天宝）、“春岛”（四季如春）、“蓬莱岛”（仙境）、
  “海棠岛”（状似海棠叶）、“蝴蝶岛”（盛产蝴蝶）、“瑚珊岛”
  （盛产瑚珊）、“甜岛”（盛产甘蔗）。四百多年前欧洲殖民者称台湾为“福摩萨”，是“美丽岛”的意思，岛美名也美，这或许是美地方须美地名才相般配的缘故吧。
    台湾的优美地名还多着哩！
    香山杨梅，清水花莲，草屯佳冬大雅；
    芬园秀林，芳苑牡丹，兰屿恒春美浓。
    这副古色古香的风景联，由台湾十四个地名组成，异彩纷呈，美不胜收，给人以诗的联想、美的享受。这也从文化背景上表示：博大精深的中国传统文化，哺育了台湾的文明。
