Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

"I Have Full Confidence in China"
– An Interview with Syrian Writer Mr. Maruha
By Lv Zhixing, People's Daily Reporter

The study of Syrian renowned writer and poet Abdul Munim Maruha is like an ocean of books, with bookshelves lining the walls and various books piled high on the small desk... In the run-up to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the reporter conducted an interview with the 75-year-old Mr. Maruha in this study.

Mr. Maruha has been working in the field of Arabic literature for over 50 years, publishing more than 100 works. During his youth, he also translated works by Lenin and Gorky. He has always paid close attention to the changes and development of Chinese society. From the very beginning of the founding of New China, Mr. Maruha developed an inseparable bond with China. When the reporter's topic turned to China's development, Mr. Maruha excitedly said, "New China represents the progressive forces of the world. I love New China and the Chinese people. Although China was poor at that time, her literary treasures shone with a unique luster that deeply attracted me. In 1954, I first translated and published important works by Mr. Lu Xun, and then introduced the story beloved by the Chinese people, 'White-Haired Girl,' to the Arab people." He stood up and pulled out a thick, yellowed notebook from the bookshelf, which recorded the catalog of Chinese literary works he had translated and published over the decades. He mentioned several dozen contemporary Chinese famous writers and poets, such as Ba Jin and Mao Dun, and occasionally recited a few lines of poetry he liked.

Mr. Maruha also affectionately told the reporter that in 1977, during his third visit to China, his goal was to become a messenger of literary exchange between China and the Arab world. He hoped to live in China for 10 years to introduce the essence of Arabic literature to China and, at the same time, introduce the treasures of Chinese literature to the Arab people. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, Mr. Maruha was unable to fulfill this ambition and had to return to Syria in 1978. Despite this, Mr. Maruha said that the two years he spent living and working in China left him with an unforgettable impression. He sighed, "The Chinese nation is a hardworking, brave, and ever-striving nation. The reform and opening-up policy currently being implemented has brought China into a new stage of historical development." He believed that, just as with cultural development, a country and a nation can only develop and make continuous progress by constantly absorbing the essence of other countries. He said, "I believe in Premier Zhou Enlai's prediction that as long as the Chinese people strive hard, China will definitely become one of the strongest and most advanced countries in the world within a century or two."

Regarding the recent counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Mr. Maruha firmly stated that he fully supports the Chinese government in suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot. He said, "This is an attempt by a small number of people in China, under the banner of so-called 'democracy,' to change China's socialist system and overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Moreover, this also shows that some Western countries are using their culture to infiltrate socialist China." He firmly stated, "I have full confidence in China."

As he bid farewell, Mr. Maruha affectionately said, "During my time working in Beijing, the Chinese people gave me a great honor, conferring upon me the title of Honorary Professor of Peking University. I sincerely hope that Chinese youth will restore and carry forward China's revolutionary traditions. This tradition has brought China revolutionary victories and will also make China continuously develop and grow stronger."

### “我对中国充满信心”——访叙利亚作家马鲁海先生

    “我对中国充满信心”
    ——访叙利亚作家马鲁海先生
    本报记者　吕志星
    叙利亚著名作家、诗人阿卜杜·穆恩·马鲁海先生的书房犹如一个书的海洋，四壁书架林立，上面摆满了各类书籍，小小的书桌上也堆积着尚未脱手的书稿……
    在中华人民共和国成立40周年前夕，记者就在这间书房里采访了75岁高龄的马鲁海先生。
    马鲁海先生在阿拉伯文学领域中耕耘了50多个春秋，发表了上百部作品。青年时期，他还曾翻译列宁和高尔基的著作。他一直关注中国社会的变化和发展。新中国成立之初，马鲁海先生就同中国结下了不解之缘。当记者的话题转到中国的发展时，马鲁海先生激动地说：“新中国代表了世界上的进步力量，我热爱新中国和中国人民。当时中国虽然贫穷，但是她的文学宝库闪烁的异彩深深地吸引着我。1954年，我首先将鲁迅先生的重要作品翻译出版，接着又把中国人民喜爱的故事《白毛女》介绍给阿拉伯人民。”他站起身来，顺手从书架上抽出一本已经泛黄的厚厚的记事本，里面记载着他几十年来翻译出版的中国文学作品的目录。他提到了巴金、茅盾等几十名当代中国著名的作家和诗人，并且不时背诵几句他所喜欢的诗句。
    马鲁海先生还深情地告诉记者，1977年他第3次来中国，目的是想成为一名中国与阿拉伯文学交流的使者。他希望能在中国住上10年，以便把阿拉伯文学的精华介绍给中国，同时也将中国文学的瑰宝介绍给阿拉伯人民。但非常遗憾，由于健康原因，马鲁海先生没能实现这一宏愿，不得不在1978年返回叙利亚。尽管如此，马鲁海先生说，他在中国生活工作的这两年时间，留下了终生难忘的印象。他感慨地说，中华民族是一个勤劳勇敢、不断进取的民族。正在实施的改革开放政策，使中国进入一个新的历史发展阶段。他认为，同文化发展一样，一个国家、一个民族只有不断吸收其它国家的精华才能发展，才能不断进步。他说：“我相信周恩来总理的预言，中国人民只要努力奋斗，中国在一二个世纪内定会成为世界上最强大、最先进的国家之一。”
    对不久前在北京发生的反革命暴乱事件，马鲁海先生以坚定的口气表示，他完全支持中国政府平息这场反革命暴乱。他说，这是中国极少数人打着所谓“民主”的旗帜，企图改变中国社会主义制度，推翻中国共产党的领导。另外，这也说明这是西方一些国家正利用它们的文化向社会主义的中国进行渗透。他坚定地表示：“我对中国充满信心。”
    临别时，马鲁海先生还深情地说：“我在北京工作期间，中国人民给了我很高的荣誉，授予我北京大学名誉教授头衔，我衷心希望中国青年恢复和发扬中国的革命传统。这个传统使中国取得了革命的胜利，也将使中国不断发展壮大。”
