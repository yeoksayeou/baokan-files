	The adjustments to loan policies for township enterprises have taken effect. The total loan amount has been controlled, and the structure is changing.

	BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- According to information from the Agricultural Bank of China, as of now, the total loan amount for township enterprises by rural financial institutions has been controlled. From January to August this year, the loan balance increased by only 4.7% compared to the same period last year. The loan structure has also been adjusted, with 73.1 billion yuan in loans issued to township and village enterprises in the first eight months of this year, prioritizing industries and enterprises that align with national industrial policies.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, rural credit has played a significant role in the rapid development of township enterprises. By the end of 1988, 80% of township and village enterprises had established loan relationships with the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives, with a loan balance of 85 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 27% of the total output value of township and village enterprises. However, due to the impact of economic overheating, the growth of loans for township enterprises once accelerated too rapidly, exceeding the capacity of rural credit. Starting in 1987, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives began to control the total loan amount for township enterprises, with the loan growth rate decreasing year by year. It is estimated that this year's total loan amount will increase by only 8%, significantly lower than the growth rate of the same period's output value.

	While controlling the total loan amount for township enterprises, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives do not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach but adjust the loan structure, supporting what needs to be supported and restricting what needs to be restricted.

	From January to August this year, the Sichuan Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China issued 50 million yuan in loans for key projects in the rural power industry, an 8% increase compared to the same period last year. The Agricultural Bank of China branches in 12 coastal provinces and cities issued over 40 billion yuan in loans for export-oriented enterprises, a growth of more than 10% compared to the same period last year. The Shandong Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China saw a net decrease of nearly 100 million yuan in loans to a batch of light textile enterprises competing with heavy industry for raw materials. The Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China stopped lending to 119 small steel rolling mills with high energy consumption, prompting their closure.

	A relevant official from the Agricultural Bank of China told reporters that the growth rate of loans for township enterprises should be aligned with the normal development speed of township enterprises, preventing blind development while fully utilizing the existing production capacity of township enterprises to increase effective supply. The adjustment of the loan structure for township enterprises should continue to be guided by national industrial policies, ensuring that limited loans for township enterprises are reasonably allocated among different industries, regions, enterprises, and products.

　　乡镇企业贷款政策调整见效
    总量得到控制　结构正在变化
    本报北京9月13日讯　记者江夏从中国农业银行获悉：到目前为止，农村金融部门对乡镇企业的贷款总量已经得到控制，今年1—8月，贷款余额仅比去年同期增长4.7％；贷款结构也有所调整，今年头8个月，对乡村办企业累放贷款731亿元，优先支持了符合国家产业政策的产业、企业。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，农村信贷对乡镇企业的蓬勃发展发挥了重要作用。到1988年底，有80％的乡村办企业与农行和信用社建立了贷款关系，贷款余额达到850亿元，约占乡村办企业总产值的27％。但由于受到经济过热的影响，乡镇企业贷款一度增长过快，超出了农村信贷的承受能力。从1987年起，农行和信用社开始控制乡镇企业贷款总量，贷款增长幅度逐年下降。预计今年全年只增加8％，大大低于同期产值增长幅度。
    在控制乡镇企业贷款总量的同时，农行和信用社不搞一刀切，对贷款结构进行调整，该扶持的扶持，该限制的限制。
    今年1—8月，四川省农行为全省农村电力工业骨干项目累放贷款5000万元，比去年同期增加8％；沿海12省市农行为出口创汇企业累放贷款40多亿元，比去年同期增长10％以上。山东省农行对一批与大工业争原料的轻纺企业的贷款净下降近一亿元；辽宁省农行对119个高耗能的小轧钢厂停止贷款，促使其关闭。
    农业银行有关负责人对记者说，乡镇企业贷款的增长幅度，应与乡镇企业正常发展速度相适应，既要防止盲目发展，又要根据条件，充分利用现有乡镇企业生产能力，增加有效供给。乡镇企业贷款结构的调整，要以国家产业政策为导向继续进行，使有限的乡镇企业贷款在不同产业、地区、企业、产品间得到合理配置。
