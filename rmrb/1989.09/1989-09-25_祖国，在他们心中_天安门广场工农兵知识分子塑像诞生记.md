An 8-meter-high, 6-meter-wide giant statue of workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals stands in a cluster of flowers on Tiananmen Square, adding splendor to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The confident worker looking towards the future, the formidable soldier of the People's Liberation Army, the female peasant holding golden ears of wheat, and the intelligent female intellectual are arranged in a harmonious arc, gazing at the solemn Tiananmen Gate. They seem to be standing in review, or perhaps marching towards a brighter future for the motherland. This statue, which embodies the essence of the republic, blends seamlessly with the grand architecture of Tiananmen Square, the fluttering red flags, and the beautiful flower beds, showcasing the spirit of the republic.

Recently, the reporter, filled with excitement, interviewed the designers and creators of this giant statue—the faculty and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Design. The academy's president, Chang Shana, and the party secretary, Zhao Long, told the reporter that the task of creating this giant statue for the national day celebration was assigned to them by Mayor Chen Xitong in early August. The academy decided to entrust the task to the teachers and students of the Department of Decorative Arts and Sculpture. Zhang Ling, the fourth-generation successor of the renowned folk artist Zhang Nianzu, and the young lecturer Chen Wanshan, among others, completed the initial draft in just a few days. Another successor of Zhang Nianzu, Zhang Tong, visited Tiananmen Square to interview soldiers from the martial law troops and took dozens of photos to create the draft for the soldier's heroic posture. Lecturer Wang Peibo and graduate student Xu Zhenglong also collected a large amount of material for the draft. In mid-August, when Mayor Chen Xitong and other leaders reviewed their drafts, they repeatedly praised, "Good, good, good!"

Forty-five teachers and students from the academy participated in the creation of this giant statue. On the 20th, the reporter braved the drizzling autumn rain to visit the Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, and Intellectuals Statue on Tiananmen Square. The head of the Department of Decorative Arts, Professor Yuan Yunfu, and Vice Professor Du Dakai were there, adjusting the colors for the statue. Workers from the Beijing Architectural Art Sculpture Factory were also working in the rain. It was hard to tell whether the sweat on their foreheads and clothes was from the rain or from their labor.

Such a giant statue would typically require a full year of work, but they completed it in just one month.

Famous Chinese sculptors and artists such as Liu Kaichu, Wang Linyi, Wang Heinei, Zeng Zhushao, Sheng Yang, Si Tu Zhaoguang, and Cao Chunsheng praised the statue as a masterpiece that perfectly unifies thought and art.

    祖国，在他们心中
    ——天安门广场工农兵知识分子塑像诞生记
    新华社记者　黄智敏
    一座高8米、宽6米的工农兵知识分子巨型雕塑像，矗立在天安门广场的鲜花丛中，为共和国40周年国庆节增添了光彩。
    对未来充满自信的工人，威武的解放军战士，怀抱金色麦穗的女农民和聪慧的女知识分子，错落有致地排列在一条大弧形线上，凝望着庄严的天安门城楼，像是在接受检阅一般，又像是在朝着祖国美好的明天继续昂首前进。这座体现共和国主体的塑像，与天安门广场宏伟的建筑、飘动的红旗、美丽的花坛浑然一体，展现出共和国的风采。
    日前，记者怀着激奋的心情，采访了这座巨型塑像的设计者和制作者——中央工艺美术学院的师生。这个学院的院长常沙娜和学院党委书记昭隆告诉记者，这座专为庆祝国庆的巨型雕塑的制作任务，是陈希同市长在今年8月初交给我们的。学院研究决定把任务交给装饰艺术系雕塑专业的老师和同学。著名民间艺人泥人张的第四代传人张锠副教授和青年助教陈皖山等，在几天时间里就构思制作出了小稿。泥人张的另一传人张铜为设计好解放军战士的英姿，特地到天安门广场采访了戒严部队战士，并拍下了几十张照片做样稿。讲师王培波和研究生许正龙，在设计前也收集了大批资料做样稿。8月中旬，陈希同等领导同志在审查他们设计的小稿时，连声称赞“好、好、好！”
    这个学院有45名师生参加了这座巨型塑像的制作工作。20日，记者冒着绵绵秋雨来到天安门广场工农兵知识分子塑像前采访时，装饰艺术系主任袁运甫教授和杜大恺副教授等，正在那里为塑像配制颜色。北京建筑艺术雕塑工厂的工人师傅们，也在那里冒雨工作。在他们的额头和衣服上，分不清哪是汗水，哪是雨水。
    这样巨型的塑像，按工作量，少说也得用整整一年时间，而他们却只用了一个月就完成了任务。
    我国著名的雕塑家和艺术家刘开渠、王临乙、王合内、曾竹韶、盛扬、司徒兆光、曹春生等，赞扬这座塑像是思想性和艺术性达到高度统一的杰作。
