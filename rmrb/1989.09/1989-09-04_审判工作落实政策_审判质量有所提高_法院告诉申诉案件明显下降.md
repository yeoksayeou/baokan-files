Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

Local courts across the country have improved and strengthened their work on complaints and appeals. In the first half of this year, the number of complaints, appeals, and non-litigation letters and visits decreased by 31% compared to the same period last year.

According to a relevant official from the Complaints and Appeals Trial Division of the Supreme People's Court, this positive change is mainly due to the completion of policy implementation in judicial work. Criminal appeals have significantly decreased, and the quality of first and second-instance trials has improved.

It is understood that 23 high courts, 222 intermediate courts, and 1,045 basic courts across the country have established complaints and appeals trial divisions, accounting for 76%, 68.3%, and 36.9% of the courts at the same level, respectively. Most courts have also implemented a system where the court president holds open days, personally reviews important letters, and promotes and drives the timely resolution of complaints and appeals cases.

Among the numerous appeals and visits, courts have identified cases with potential misjudgments as key cases for investigation and handling.

Statistics show that this year, courts at all levels across the country have reviewed 53,179 cases through judicial supervision procedures, with 50,373 cases concluded. Among these, 30,590 cases maintained the original verdict, accounting for 60.7% of the concluded cases, while 11,707 cases were retried, accounting for 23.3%.

To address the long-standing issue of difficulties in filing complaints, courts at all levels have taken relevant measures to resolve it, achieving significant results.
