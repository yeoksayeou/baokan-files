The State Council recently approved four special policies proposed by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Council Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas. The policies aim to accelerate economic development in ethnic minority regions and further strengthen national unity. The goal is to address the basic livelihood needs of minority populations in 141 counties as soon as possible.

The four special policies are as follows:

	— Promote the development of advantageous industries. Local governments and relevant departments should continue to provide support in terms of funding, materials, technology, and management to facilitate the development of local resources.

	— Ensure the free sale of agricultural and sideline products.

	— Reduce burdens and enhance internal vitality. Exempt poor households from agricultural and pastoral taxes; poor households are exempt from purchasing national savings bonds.

	— Establish a poverty alleviation fund for ethnic minority areas. This fund will be jointly managed by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and relevant departments on a project-by-project basis.
