Every day, as the morning sun pulls back the blue curtain of the sky and the dawn light filters through the mist over the Yalu River in Danong City, Liaoning Province, the park's three-dimensional flower beds echo with distinctive Korean folk music. People, drawn by the melody, begin to dance to "Dollagi" and other Korean dances. At a time when disco and aerobics are sweeping the nation, this is like a refreshing breeze, giving Danong City's morning exercises a unique character.

The organizer of this activity is the Danong City Korean Elderly Association. At the beginning of the year, they noticed that more and more people were participating in morning exercises and thought: Danong is a place where Koreans live, so we should organize morning exercises that suit Korean characteristics. They entrusted the specific organizational work to Li Zhengjun, a dance official at the Danong City Korean Cultural Center. Li, who graduated from the Yanbian Art School, had been married for just over half a year but was very enthusiastic about this activity. This year, when the warm spring breeze blew in April, Li played the first melody in the park. At that time, with disco and aerobics being so popular, Li was not sure if this activity would be welcomed by the public.

For the first three days, only about 20 Koreans participated, and the scene was rather cold. Starting from the fourth day, a group of Han, Manchu, and Hui people were also attracted, though they were a bit clumsy, they were full of interest in learning. Li was excited, both for having so many like-minded people and for the great appeal of Korean dance. He combined traditional Korean dance with aerobic dance, making it both elegant and graceful, with a strong health benefit. This dance involves spinning, which is even better than aerobic dance that involves jumping in place.

However, this dance is relatively difficult to learn. Taking the traditional Korean dance "Dollagi," which almost all Koreans know, as an example, it is in a 6/8 time signature. Li taught enthusiastically and patiently from the basic steps. In a short time, he taught everyone to dance "Dollagi," "Harvest Dance," "Rest on the Construction Site," "Happy Holiday," "Song of the Bright Moon," "Joy," and "Swing Girl." Li said, "Now, the best dancers are a few Han compatriots!"

This activity delighted the Koreans who love singing and dancing, and it also delighted some elderly women. Sixty-year-old Aemae Son Hyeon-suk and 59-year-old Aemae Li Ok-sun, both living more than 10 kilometers away in the suburbs, come to dance every morning. Fifty-four-year-old Korean kindergarten principal Wu Gwan-yik said: "Dancing in the morning makes the whole day's work more enjoyable and energetic." To dance well in Korean style, elderly women Li Chun-yeong, Kim Yeong-ae, Son Hyeon-suk, and An Gyeong-ju each spent over 200 yuan on a beautiful traditional long skirt. This activity brings together people from several ethnic groups, and everyone's emotions blend together, becoming friends and unknowingly strengthening ethnic unity.

    《道拉基》的魅力
    傅诚
    每天，当清晨的双手拉开蓝色的天幕，曙光透过薄纱般的江雾映红辽宁丹东市鸭绿江公园的时候，公园内立体花坛旁便响起了特色鲜明的朝鲜族乐曲。被乐曲唤来的人们随着优美的曲调，跳起《道拉基》等朝鲜族舞蹈。在迪斯科、健身操风靡全国之时，这犹如一阵清新之风，使丹东市的晨练活动独具特色。
    组织这项活动的是丹东市朝鲜族老年协会。年初，他们看到参加晨练的人越来越多，心想：丹东是朝鲜族聚居的地方，应该开展适合朝鲜族特点的晨练活动。他们把具体组织工作交给了市朝鲜族文化馆舞蹈干部李正均。毕业于延边艺术学校的小李结婚才半年多，却很热心这项活动。今年，当4月和煦的春风吹来，小李在公园内奏响了第一支乐曲。当前迪斯科、健身操这样热，这项活动能否受到群众欢迎，说实在的，当时小李心中还没有底。
    头三天，只有20来个朝鲜族人参加，场面冷清。从第四天起，一批汉族、满族、回族人也被吸引来了，虽显笨拙却满有兴趣地学了起来。小李兴奋了，为自己能有这么多知音，为朝鲜族舞蹈能有这么大的吸引力。他把传统的朝鲜族舞蹈与健身舞结合起来，既优美潇洒，健身作用又强。这种舞是转圈跳，比健身操原地跳又胜一筹。
    然而，这种舞步又比较难学。以朝鲜族几乎老少皆会的传统舞《道拉基》为例，就是八分之六拍的。小李热情而耐心地从一招一式教起。不长时间，他教会了大家跳《道拉基》、《丰收舞》、《工地上的休息》、《愉快的节日》、《明月之歌》、《欢乐》、《秋千姑娘》等。小李说，现在跳得最好的还数几位汉族同志哩！
    有了这项活动可乐坏了能歌善舞的朝鲜族人，乐坏了一些老阿妈妮。60岁的阿妈妮宋贤淑、59岁的阿妈妮李玉顺，家都住在10多公里远的郊区，每天早晨都赶来跳舞。54岁的朝鲜族幼儿园园长吴权益说：“早晨来跳一跳，一天工作起来都很愉快，精神饱满。”为了跳好朝鲜族舞，老阿妈妮李春英、金永爱、宋贤淑、安景珠等，每人都花200多元做了一套精美的民族长裙。这种活动把几个民族的人聚集在一起，大家情感交融成了朋友，在不知不觉中增强了民族团结。
