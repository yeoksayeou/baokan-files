The construction company of the Eighth of August in Luoyang City undertook the contract for the White Village Canal project in the suburbs of Luoyang City, which was supposed to be completed and handed over for use by the end of March this year. Due to the chaotic management at the construction site, frequent changes of workers, outdated construction equipment, and the fact that the construction quality did not meet the design standards, a breach occurred in the upstream cofferdam on March 12, leading to the suspension of the project.

Currently, this project has already invested 370,000 yuan, but only 60% of the work has been completed. By July 10, when the floodwaters came, the construction site was destroyed again. It is now certain that the 100,000 mu of farmland in the Luochang Irrigation District will not be able to benefit from the water on time. It is unknown what measures the contracting unit plans to take.

	The workers refused to work because they could not receive their wages on time. (Middle picture) The floodwaters submerged the construction equipment. (Bottom picture) More than 30 tons of cement were ruined by the floodwaters.

    承包方清醒了没有？
    洛阳市八一建筑工程公司承包洛阳市郊区白村渠工程，应于今年三月底交付使用。由于工程现场管理混乱，民工更换频繁，施工设备陈旧，工程质量达不到设计标准，三月十二日，修筑的上游围堰发生决口，工程被迫停工。
    目前，这项工程已投入三十七万元，工程才完成百分之六十，七月十日洪水下来，工地再次被毁。洛商灌区十万亩农田不能按时受益已成定局，不知承包工程的单位准备怎么办？
      （上图）民工们因不能按时领取工资拒绝出工。（中图）洪水淹没了施工设备。（下图）三十多吨水泥被洪水冲泡报废。
