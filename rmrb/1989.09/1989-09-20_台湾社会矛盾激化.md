In recent years, due to the rapid development of capitalism in Taiwan and the dramatic changes in the political situation both within and outside the island, contradictions in various aspects of Taiwanese society have surfaced, and social contradictions have taken on new developments.

	The Rise of the Middle Class

With the development of Taiwan's export-oriented capitalist economy, a middle class emerged in the 1970s and became prominent in the 1980s, becoming a new social force. Politically, the middle class hopes for stable development and fair competition in society. The corrupt rule of the Kuomintang has disappointed them, so they have placed their hopes in outsider figures and the Democratic Progressive Party. However, the "Taiwan independence" tendencies and radical street movements within the Democratic Progressive Party have made them anxious. Today's middle class is not yet a solidified class; there are various differences and contradictions within it, and political tendencies are diverse.

	The Trend of Self-Help

Alongside the rise of the middle class, the urban population has rapidly increased, accounting for four-fifths of the total population. Their interests and demands are diverse. After the lifting of martial law, the ban on political parties, and the ban on the press, society has become unprecedentedly active, and various latent social contradictions have quickly surfaced and become apparent. Various social forces have reorganized, forming various interest groups and engaging in self-help movements. The so-called self-help movements are: when the interests of the people are harmed and the authorities remain indifferent, the people spontaneously organize to seek solutions through collective power. Petitions, protests, and taking to the streets have become a social trend. There have been consumer movements, anti-pollution movements, women's movements, student movements, indigenous people's rights movements, mainlanders' return-to-hometown movements, political prisoners' rights movements, farmers' movements, labor movements, anti-nuclear power movements, and so on.

The labor class is awakening, and labor parties and labor unions have emerged in response. Labor disputes have increased rapidly since the 1980s. Taiwanese farmers have taken to the streets multiple times to protest, petition, and advocate for their rights.

The rise of self-help movements is a necessary result of Taiwan's social diversification and the development of social contradictions. The people openly advocating for democratic rights and fair treatment is something that the Taiwanese authorities cannot suppress.

	Social Disorder

Social morals have deteriorated, and public security has worsened. "Everyone's Happy" and "Six Lucky Numbers" gambling activities are rampant, and pornographic activities are widespread, with improper barbershops and "pachinko" parlors everywhere. Financial fraud, violence, and shooting incidents are increasing.

The stock market is booming, attracting more than a million people to engage in a frenzied money game. Underground investment companies are rampant, using high-interest rates to attract speculative funds for various investment activities.

Money politics is on the rise, and political morals are deteriorating. Running for public office often involves tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of New Taiwan dollars. Elections and money are intertwined, becoming a major social ill in Taiwan.

　　台湾社会矛盾激化
　　台湾民主自治同盟主席团主席　蔡子民
    近年来，由于台湾资本主义的迅速发展和岛内外政治形势的急剧变化，台湾社会各个层面的矛盾迸发出来，社会矛盾有新的发展。
              中产阶级崛起
    伴随台湾加工出口导向型资本主义经济的发展，在70年代，台湾就明显地形成了中产阶级，到60年代，它的存在突出出来，成为新兴的社会力量。在政治上，中产阶级希望社会稳定地发展，公平地竞争。国民党的腐败政权，使他们感到失望，于是寄希望于党外人士及民进党。然而民进党中的“台独”倾向和激烈的街头运动，又使他们惴惴不安。因今天的中产阶级还不是一个定型的阶级，其内部存在着多种差异和矛盾，政治倾向不一。
              自力救济风潮
    与中产阶级崛起同时，都市居民迅速增加，多达总人口的4／5。他们的利益不同，诉求不一。在解除戒严、党禁、报禁之后，社会力空前活跃，各种潜伏的社会矛盾迅速公开化、表面化。各派社会力量重新组合，成立种种利益团体，进行自力救济运动。所谓自力救济运动是：当民众利益受到损害而当局对此无动于衷时，民众自发组织起来，用集体力量寻求解决的一种民众社会运动。请愿、抗议、走上街头，已成为一股社会风潮，先后有消费者运动、反污染运动、妇女运动、学生运动、原住民人权运动、外省人返乡运动、政治受难人人权运动、农民运动、劳工运动、反核电运动等等。
    劳工阶级正在觉醒，工党、劳动党应运而成立。劳资争议80年代以后迅速增加。台湾农民为维护自身权益，多次上街游行，抗议，请愿。
    自力救济运动迭起，是台湾社会多元化、社会矛盾发展的必然结果。民众公开争取民主权利和公平待遇，是台湾当局难以遏制的。
                社会脱序
    社会风气败坏，治安恶化。“大家乐”、“六合彩”赌博活动风行，色情活动泛滥，不当的理发厅、“柏青哥”（弹子房）等到处可见。金钱欺诈、暴力及枪击案件日益增多。
    股票市场狂飚，吸引百万以上的人口，投入疯狂的金钱游戏。地下投资公司猖獗，以高利率吸取游资，从事各种投入性活动。
    金钱政治日炽，政治风气败坏。竞选公职，动辄数千万甚至几亿元新台币。选举与金钱结缘，已成为台湾社会一大公害。
