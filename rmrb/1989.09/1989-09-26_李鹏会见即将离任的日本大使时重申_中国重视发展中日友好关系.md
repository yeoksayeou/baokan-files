Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th.

Premier Li Peng today met with the outgoing Japanese Ambassador to China, Toshitsugu Nakatani, at Zhongnanhai's Ziguangge, reaffirming that the Sino-Japanese friendship is hard-won and that China values the development of this relationship.

He said, "The recent successful visit by Yotaro Kawanishi has contributed to the restoration and development of bilateral relations. We appreciate and thank Mr. Nakatani for his efforts."

Li Peng emphasized that China and Japan are neighboring countries with a long history of friendship; however, there was a period of misfortune in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, today's Sino-Japanese friendship is hard-won. He reiterated that the Chinese government has always valued the development of friendly relations between the two countries and their peoples.

Premier Li Peng asked Mr. Nakatani to convey his greetings to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu upon his return to Japan and to thank him for the message brought by Yotaro Kawanishi during his visit to China. Li Peng also asked Mr. Nakatani to convey to Kaifu that China's policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged, "If there are any adjustments, they will only make things better; China's long-term policy of developing friendly neighborly relations with Japan remains unchanged."

Nakatani said he was "pleased and inspired" by Li Peng's remarks. He expressed that he would report back to the Japanese Prime Minister upon his return.

Li Peng praised Nakatani for his contributions to the development of Sino-Japanese friendship. He welcomed Nakatani, as an old friend of China, to visit more often. He said, "You will see that China will continue to progress and develop."

    李鹏会见即将离任的日本大使时重申
    中国重视发展中日友好关系
    新华社北京9月25日电　（记者周树春）国务院总理李鹏今天在中南海紫光阁会见即将离任的日本驻华大使中岛敏次郎时重申，今天的中日友好关系来之不易，中国重视发展这种关系。
    他说，不久前伊东正义访华取得了成功，为两国关系的恢复和发展作出了贡献，中岛敏次郎为此也作出了努力，“我们表示赞赏和感谢。”
    李鹏说，中日两国是一衣带水的邻邦，有长期的友好历史；上世纪末以来也有过一段不幸，因此今天的中日友好关系来之不易。他重申，中国政府一贯重视发展两国和两国人民之间的友好关系。
    李鹏总理请中岛敏次郎回国后向海部俊树首先转达他的问候，并感谢他在伊东访华时带来了口信。李鹏还请中岛向海部表示：中国的改革开放政策没有变化，“如果说有什么要调整的话，只会越调越好；中国长期发展中日睦邻友好关系的方针也没有变。”
    中岛说，听了李鹏的讲话“感到高兴和鼓舞”。他表示回国后将向日本首相报告。
    李鹏称赞中岛敏次郎为发展中日友好关系做了很多工作。他欢迎中岛作为中国的老朋友有机会多来看看。他说，“你将看到中国会不断前进和发展。”
