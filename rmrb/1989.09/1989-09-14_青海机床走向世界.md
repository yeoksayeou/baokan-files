During the 1988 Beijing Machine Tool Exhibition, a senior leader from the central government stood in front of the flexible manufacturing unit produced by Qinghai First Machine Tool Factory, which was at the international level of the 1980s, and happily said, "I didn't expect Qinghai to have such a good machine tool factory, and it can even produce world-class machine tools."

In the old society, Qinghai had almost no industry. At the time of liberation in 1949, the entire province had only 15 industrial enterprises that could be counted, with just 2 steam boilers, 7 electric motors, 3 generators, and 6 hand-operated machine tools. Today, Qinghai can produce ordinary machine tools, heavy-duty machine tools, and high-precision machine tools. Qinghai First Machine Tool Factory alone has updated and developed machine tools with international standards of the late 1970s and early 1980s, consisting of 7 series and over 40 varieties, and has entered the first-class level of global machine tool production. In the past three years, they have developed 25 new varieties, including flexible manufacturing units at the world's advanced level, which are not only popular in the domestic market but also exported to the United States, West Germany, Italy, Hungary, Egypt, Australia, Brazil, and other countries, becoming sought-after products in the international market.

### 青海机床走向世界

　　青海机床走向世界
    1988年举办北京机床博览会时，中央一位领导同志站在青海第一机床厂生产的具有国际八十年代水平的柔性制造单元面前，高兴地说：“没想到青海能有这样好的机床厂，还能造出世界第一流的机床。”
    旧社会，青海几乎没有什么工业。1949年解放时，全省凑合能算上的工业企业只有15个，仅有2台蒸汽锅炉、7部电动机、3部发电机、6台手摇机床。如今，青海已能生产普通机床、重型机床、高级精密机床。仅青海第一机床厂就更新和开发了具有七十年代末、八十年代初国际水平的机床7个系列40多个品种，而且跨入世界机床生产的一流水平。近3年来，他们研制柔性制造单元等世界先进水平的新品种25个，不仅畅销国内市场，而且出口美国、联邦德国、意大利、匈牙利、埃及、澳大利亚、巴西等国，成为国际市场上的“抢手货”。
