	Improve Management Levels and Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation
	China Accelerates the Establishment of a New National Economic Accounting System

	Recently, the State Council approved the establishment of the National Economic Accounting Coordination Committee to unify and coordinate statistical, accounting, and business accounting systems. The goal is to transition the entire national economic operation and social reproduction accounting to a new accounting system by 1992. This is an important measure to improve China's national economic management level, strengthen macroeconomic regulation, and promote scientific decision-making.

	National economic accounting is a comprehensive accounting system that reflects the social reproduction process, systematically showing the operation, connections, and laws of the national economy. China's original national economic accounting system focused heavily on material product accounting and production accounting, which is not well-suited to the current needs of deepening reforms and strengthening macroeconomic management. In 1984, the State Council formally decided to reform the national economic accounting system. Relevant departments have organized the drafting of China's new national economic accounting system preliminary plan, which began pilot testing in 9 provinces and cities last year. Currently, the plan is being further expanded and improved based on the pilot testing to establish and perfect the new accounting system.

	According to reports, the basic content of the new national economic accounting system includes accounting for the conditions, results, benefits, and proportional relationships of social reproduction. Its basic tasks are to fully reflect China's national economic development process, coordinate the accounting of various sectors and regions of the national economy, conduct international economic comparisons, and provide a basis for macroeconomic decision-making and planning.

	Establishing a new national economic accounting system is a massive, nationwide systematic project that involves various sectors of the national economy. The newly established National Economic Accounting Coordination Committee is composed of responsible personnel from the State Statistical Bureau, State Planning Commission, State Commission for Economic Restructuring, State Science and Technology Commission, Ministry of Finance, People's Bank of China, State Bureau of Technical Supervision, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

　  提高管理水平　加强宏观调控
　　我加快建立国民经济新核算体系
    新华社北京9月11日电　（记者吴士深）最近，国务院批准成立全国国民经济核算协调委员会，统一协调统计、会计、业务等核算制度，力争1992年将整个国民经济运行和社会再生产的核算转到新的核算制度。这是提高我国国民经济管理水平，加强宏观调控、促进决策科学化的一项重要措施。
    国民经济核算是以社会再生产过程为对象的全面核算，系统地反映国民经济运行的过程、联系和规律性。我国原有的国民经济核算制度偏重于物质产品核算和生产核算，同当前深化改革和加强宏观经济管理的需要很不适应。1984年，国务院正式决定改革国民经济核算体系。有关部门组织制订了我国新的国民经济核算体系初步方案，并于去年开始在9个省、市进行试点试算，目前正在进一步扩大试点的基础上健全和完善新的核算制度。
    据介绍，新的国民经济核算制度基本内容包括社会再生产的条件、成果、效益和比例关系等方面核算。它的基本任务是全面反映我国国民经济发展过程、协调国民经济各部门和各地区核算、进行国际经济比较、为宏观经济决策和计划提供依据。
    建立新的国民经济核算体系是一项巨大的全国性系统工程，涉及国民经济各个部门。新成立的全国国民经济核算协调委员会由国家统计局、国家计委、国家体改委、国家科委、财政部、人民银行和国家技术监督局、工商局等有关方面负责人组成。
