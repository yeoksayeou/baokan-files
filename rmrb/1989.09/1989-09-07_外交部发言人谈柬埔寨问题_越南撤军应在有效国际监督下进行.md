The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing, stated at a press conference this afternoon that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia should be conducted under strict and effective international supervision. According to reports, Vietnam is currently supporting the Phnom Penh regime in preparing to escalate the war, which cannot but raise concerns and vigilance in the international community.

A reporter asked: Vietnam has expressed that it will invite relevant countries and individuals to observe the final withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia. Will China send officials or journalists to observe the withdrawal?

The spokesperson replied: People do not believe that Vietnam will truly withdraw all its troops. We advocate that the relevant parties should first reach an agreement on a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue. Vietnam's withdrawal should be conducted under strict and effective international supervision, and the international supervision mechanism should be established and chaired by the United Nations. Otherwise, it will be difficult to determine and confirm whether Vietnam has truly withdrawn all its troops from Cambodia.

A reporter asked: The Paris International Conference on the Cambodian Issue did not reach an agreement. It is reported that all parties in Cambodia are strengthening their armed forces, preparing for a major battle. What is China's comment on the tense situation in Cambodia? What actions will China take?

The spokesperson replied: The Cambodian issue is caused by Vietnam's aggression, and the key to politically solving the Cambodian issue lies in whether Vietnam has the sincerity.

He said that due to the rigid attitude of Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime, the recent international conference on the Cambodian issue held in Paris failed to reach an agreement. According to reports, Vietnam is currently supporting the Phnom Penh regime in preparing to escalate the war, which cannot but raise concerns and vigilance in the international community. We believe that all countries that uphold justice will continue to support the Cambodian three anti-invasion forces.

He emphasized that, in order to comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably politically solve the Cambodian issue, and to restore peace in Cambodia and prevent civil war, Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision. During the transitional period from Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia to the holding of elections in Cambodia, a temporary united government led by Prince Sihanouk should be established, and the armies of the four Cambodian factions should be frozen and reduced.

    外交部发言人谈柬埔寨问题
    越南撤军应在有效国际监督下进行
    新华社北京9月7日电　外交部发言人李肇星今天下午在新闻发布会上说，越南从柬埔寨撤军应在严格有效的国际监督下进行。据报道，越南现在正支持金边当局准备扩大战争规模，这不能不引起国际社会的关切和警惕。
    有记者问：越南表示将邀请有关国家和人士观察越从柬最后的撤军。中国是否将派官员或记者前往观察撤军？
    发言人答：人们并不相信越南真正全部撤军。我们主张有关各方应首先就全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬问题达成协议。越南撤军应在严格有效的国际监督下进行，国际监督机制应由联合国建立和主持，否则很难判断和确认越南是否已真正从柬全部撤军。
    有记者问：巴黎柬埔寨问题国际会议未达成协议。据传，柬各方都开始加强自己的武装力量，准备打大仗。中国对柬的紧张局势有何评论？准备采取什么行动？
    发言人答：柬埔寨问题是由越南侵略造成的，政治解决柬埔寨问题的关键在于越南是否有诚意。
    他说，由于越南与金边当局态度僵硬，不久前在巴黎召开的柬问题国际会议未能达成协议。据报道，越南现在正支持金边当局准备扩大战争规模，这不能不引起国际社会的关切和警惕。我们相信，一切主持正义的国家将继续支持反对侵略战争的柬埔寨三方抵抗力量。
    他强调说，为了全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬问题，为了在柬恢复和平、防止内战，越南必须在严格有效的国际监督下从柬真正全部撤军，并在越南从柬撤军后到柬实行大选前的过渡时期，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的柬四方临时联合政府，对柬四方的军队实行冻结和裁减。
