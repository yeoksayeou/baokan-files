The spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, Tang Shubei, vice director and spokesperson, said in a talk with reporters from Xinhua News Agency this morning that in recent years, Taiwan journalists have broken through the blockade imposed by the Taiwan authorities to come to the mainland to report on the true situation, which has played a positive role in promoting mutual understanding and exchanges between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

He said that to better ensure that Taiwan journalists can conduct normal and legal reporting activities on the mainland, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office requests that Taiwan journalists pay attention to the following matters when coming to the mainland to report.

Tang Shubei said that Taiwan journalists who wish to report from the mainland must first apply to the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch or the Chinese embassies and consulates abroad. Applicants should submit an official letter of assignment from their news organization, a resume of the journalist, and a specific reporting plan (including the reporting project and target, reporting region, and duration of stay, etc.). After approval, an entry permit will be issued. The reporting period is generally not more than one month.

He pointed out that the journalists whose applications for reporting are accepted are those from normal news organizations in Taiwan such as newspapers, magazines, news agencies, radio stations, and television stations (including photographers, video personnel, etc.).

After Taiwan journalists are permitted to enter the mainland for reporting, they need to apply to the Chinese Journalists Association for a "Press Pass" and conduct reporting with the "Press Pass." Tang Shubei said that the "Press Pass" is a one-time document that becomes invalid after the expiration date. Each time a reporting activity is conducted, the "Press Pass" must be presented. After the reporting is completed, the "Press Pass" should be returned to the Chinese Journalists Association or the receiving unit it has entrusted.

Tang Shubei said regarding the reception issue that Taiwan journalists coming to the mainland for reporting will be received by the Chinese Journalists Association or the news organizations it has entrusted. Taiwan journalists who come specifically to the mainland to report on important political activities or large-scale academic, cultural, sports, and technological exchanges will be received by the organizing units, but they still need to apply for the "Press Pass" from the Chinese Journalists Association. After arriving in the mainland, they will be issued a press pass to participate in the reporting of the activity by the organizing unit. Their reporting is limited to the scope of the applied item. For the normal reporting activities of Taiwan journalists, the receiving unit should assist in making contacts, but the content of the reporting must be notified to the units and individuals being reported on in advance and obtain their consent.

Tang Shubei stated that currently, applications from Taiwan news organizations to station journalists or establish news bureaus or offices on the mainland are not accepted. Taiwan news organizations are not allowed to hire mainland personnel or foreigners, overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots in the mainland as special correspondents and reporters. Long-distance telephone interviews conducted by Taiwan journalists from the island are not accepted by any organization or individual.

He pointed out that Taiwan journalists conducting reporting activities on the mainland are protected by national laws; at the same time, they must abide by national laws, regulations, and relevant provisions and may not engage in activities inconsistent with their journalist identity. Those who violate the rules will be given a verbal warning, have their "Press Pass" revoked, or be dealt with by relevant departments according to the severity of the offense by the receiving unit. Journalists from Taiwan who enter the mainland for purposes such as visiting relatives or tourism are not allowed to engage in any form of reporting activities.

He finally stated that the broadcasting, television, photography, and other equipment and materials carried by Taiwan journalists coming to the mainland for reporting should be declared to customs upon entry. Customs will allow the items to pass according to relevant regulations based on proof from the Chinese Journalists Association or the Broadcasting Film and Television Department, and they must be taken out in full upon exit.

　　台湾记者来大陆采访注意事项
    新华社北京9月15日电国务院台湾事务办公室副主任、发言人唐树备，今天上午向本社记者发表谈话时说，近年来台湾记者冲破台湾当局的封锁来祖国大陆采访，报道大陆的真实情况，对促进两岸人民相互了解和交流起了积极的作用。
    他说，为了更好地保障台湾记者在大陆正常、合法地进行采访活动，国务院台湾事务办公室请台湾记者来大陆采访时注意如下事项。
    唐树备说，台湾记者要求来大陆采访需事先向新华社香港分社或中华人民共和国驻外使、领馆提出申请。申请者应提交所属新闻机构的正式委派书、记者简历和具体采访计划
  （包括采访项目和对象、采访地区及停留时间等）。经审批同意后，发给入境证件。采访时间一般不超过一个月。
    他指出，受理申请采访的台湾记者，是指正常出版和发布新闻的台湾报社、杂志社、通讯社、广播电台、电视台等新闻机构的记者、编辑（包括摄影、录象人员等）。
    台湾记者获准入境采访后，需到中国记协申请领取“采访证”，凭“采访证”采访。唐树备说，“采访证”为一次性证件，逾期作废。每次进行采访活动时均应出示“采访证”。采访结束后，应将“采访证”交回中国记协或其委托的接待单位。
    唐树备在谈到接待问题时说，台湾记者来大陆采访，由中国记协或其委托的新闻机构负责接待。台湾记者专门来大陆采访重要的政治活动或大型的学术、文化、体育、科技等交流活动，由主办单位负责接待，但仍需申领中国记协的“采访证”，到大陆后由主办单位加发参加该项活动采访的记者证。其采访只限于所申请的专项范围。台湾记者进行的正常采访活动，接待单位应协助联系，但须事先将采访内容告知被采访的单位和个人，征得其同意。
    唐树备表示，目前不受理台湾新闻机构在大陆派驻记者或设立记者站、办事处。台湾新闻机构不得聘用大陆人员或在大陆的外国人、华侨、港澳同胞为特约记者和通讯员。台湾记者从岛内进行的长途电话采访，任何机关和个人均不予接受。
    他指出，在大陆进行采访活动的台湾记者，受国家法律保护；同时必须遵守国家法律、法令和有关规定，不得进行与记者身份不符的活动。违者将视情节轻重，分别由接待单位给予口头警告、收回“采访证”或由有关部门依法处理。以探亲、旅游等名义入境的台湾记者，不得进行任何形式的采访活动。
    他最后表示，台湾记者来大陆采访携带的广播、电视、摄影等设备器材，入境时应向海关申报。海关凭中国记协或广播电影电视部的证明，按海关有关规定放行，出境时如数带出。
