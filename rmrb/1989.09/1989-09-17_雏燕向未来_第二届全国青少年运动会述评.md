The torch of the second National Youth Games has been extinguished, and thousands of athletes, under the slogan "Participate in the Youth Games today, head to the Olympics tomorrow," have been inspected, achieved excellent results, received training, and spent a wonderful and unforgettable time in the Liaoning-Shenyang region.

This Youth Games saw remarkable achievements: 1 person broke 1 world record, 2 people broke 2 world youth records, 1 person broke 1 world junior record, 3 people broke 3 Asian records, and a batch of national and national youth records were created. Many sports projects saw the emergence of new talents, alleviating the shortage of reserves. On the weightlifting platform, new strongmen emerged, reminiscent of Wu Shude and He Zhiqiang in their prime; gymnastics saw the rise of Li Xiaoshuang, Zhang Wenning, and Li Li, who are at the national team level; new "dragon kings" emerged in the swimming pool; and track and field results generally improved over the previous games.

From the results, three conclusions can be drawn. First, by focusing on cultivating reserve forces, one can break free from a backward state. This time, Jilin Province achieved good results, fully illustrating this point. They won 11 gold medals, created multiple national youth records, and changed their long-standing backward image. In contrast, some provinces and cities neglected youth sports training, resulting in declining results and a gap in their sports teams. Second, those who work hard on the fundamental projects of track and field and swimming will have hope. The host province, Liaoning, became the gold medal leader, not only because of its strong track and field foundation but also because it began to focus on water sports, adopting a land and water combined strategy. In the second Youth Games, Liaoning's swimming saw the emergence of outstanding athletes who won gold medals, accelerating their path to overall victory. Henan was even more obvious, with swimming newcomer Bao Xin alone winning 5 gold medals. Third, efforts should be made in China's advantageous projects, such as gymnastics, diving, and table tennis, which are leading projects in the world. The reserve talents in these areas should be more abundant, and the second Youth Games have already shown some good signs, which is gratifying.

The second National Youth Games was a comprehensive inspection. While achieving results, it also exposed, to a large extent, problems in youth sports training. For example, some athletes had poor psychological qualities, weak fundamentals, and rough movements during the competition. If this continues, it will cause some young athletes to wither early, ruin a batch of good seeds, and prevent the first-line teams from being replenished.

　　雏燕向未来
　　——第二届全国青少年运动会述评
    熊熊燃烧的第二届全国青少年运动会的火炬已经熄灭，数千名运动员在“今天参加青运会，明天走向奥运会”的口号下。接受了检阅，创造了佳绩，得到了锻炼，在辽沈大地上度过了美好难忘的时光。
    本届青运会成绩显著，1人1次超一项世界纪录，2人3次超2项世界青年纪录，1人1次超1项世界少年纪录，3人5次超3项亚洲纪录，还创造了一批全国纪录和全国青少年纪录。许多体育项目冒出了一批新秀，使后备匮乏的现象得到缓解。举重台上，又有一些大力士像当年吴数德、何灼强一样崭露头角；体操出现了李小双、张文宁、李莉等具有国家队水平的队员；游泳池畔冒出了新“蛟龙”；田径成绩普遍比上届提高。
    透过成绩，可得出三个结论。其一，重视后备力量的培养，就可摆脱落后状态。这次吉林省取得好成绩，充分说明了这个问题。他们夺得11枚金牌，创造了多项全国青少年纪录，改变了多年落后的面貌。相反，有的省市由于忽视青少年体育训练，成绩下降，体育队伍出现断层。其二，谁扎扎实实在田径和游泳两个基础项目上下功夫，谁就有希望。东道主辽宁能成为金牌总数第一，除了过去田径基础好外，更重要的是他们开始抓水上项目，采取水陆并进的方针。在二青会上辽宁游泳出现尖子，夺得金牌，加快了全面获胜的步伐。河南则更为明显，仅游泳新秀鲍欣一人就获5枚金牌。其三，要在我国优势项目上作文章，比如体操、跳水、乒乓球等，是我国在世界上领先的项目，其后备人才应更充足，二青会上已出现一些好势头，令人欣慰。
    第二届全国青少年运动会是一次全面的检阅，在取得成绩的同时，也较大面积地暴露了青少年体育训练的问题。如比赛中一些选手心理素质差，基本功不扎实，动作粗糙等，长此下去，将会使一些青少年运动员提早枯萎，毁掉一批好苗子，使一线运动队得不到补充。
