The Thousand Buddha Rock is located about three kilometers west of the county seat of Jianjiang, Sichuan. The Buddha statues are carved on the cliffs of the "Daguanshan" mountain range, stretching about one li (half a kilometer) along the banks of the roaring Qingyi River. There are a total of over 2,400 statues, hence the name "Thousand Buddha Rock."

The carving of these Buddha statues began during the Sui Dynasty, flourished during the Tang Dynasty, and continued through the Ming and Qing Dynasties, spanning over a thousand years. This is why it is said that "Thousand Buddha Rock was carved over a thousand years." During the heyday of the Tang Dynasty, the practice of carving Buddha statues was widespread. During the Kaiyuan era, before the monk Hai Tong started the carving of the Leshan Giant Buddha in Jia State (Leshan), the head monk of the largest temple in Jianjiang, the Pilu Temple, recruited a large number of craftsmen to carve Buddha statues by the Qingyi River. The Jianjiang Buddha statues are numerous, with large and small ones each having their unique characteristics. Among the many Buddha statues, the most distinctive ones include the seated Maitreya Buddha, the Pure Land Transformation, the Ksitigarbha, and the Guanyin.

The seated Maitreya Buddha is eight chi (about 2.6 meters) tall, with exquisite craftsmanship and proportional dimensions. It appears benevolent and amiable, as if smiling and about to speak. In terms of posture, appearance, and attire, it is quite similar to the Leshan Giant Buddha. The Cultural Relics Bureau staff mentioned that the Maitreya Buddha was carved before the Leshan Giant Buddha, serving as a "model" for it.

In addition to the Maitreya Buddha, the most striking feature is the cave in the middle section known as the "Pure Land Transformation." The plaque explains that it follows the Buddhist standard of "Pure Land Transformation." In a niche about six chi (about 2 meters) square, there are over 270 Buddha statues of various forms, as well as pavilions, towers, stupas, and sutra pillars. The central preaching Buddha statue has a dignified and benevolent demeanor. Behind the Buddha's seat, there is a beautifully carved circular backlight. Inside and outside the hall, on the upper and lower levels of the pavilions, numerous disciples are either sitting or standing, solemnly listening to the teachings. Above the Buddha's head are flying celestial maidens, appearing as if they are flying. In front of the Buddha's seat, a large orchestra is symmetrically arranged, with some playing stringed instruments and wind instruments, and others dancing, all appearing vivid and lifelike.

In addition to the numerous Buddha statues, there are other ancient relics that complement them. Below the Buddha statues is a section of the ancient plank road from the Qin and Han dynasties. The stones on the road are worn smooth and shiny from being trodden, indicating the prosperity of this ancient road in its heyday. On the steep cliffs, there are various horizontal, vertical, long, and short inscriptions, either praising the mountain and water scenery or expressing the joy of sightseeing. Calligraphy in various styles, including cursive, seal, and clerical scripts, is displayed, as if presenting a calligraphy exhibition to the visitors. On the northern slope of the mountain, there is a protruding giant rock, about four zhang (about 13 meters) high, resembling a high platform. In front of the platform, the words "Pointing Generals Platform" are carved. Steps lead up to the top of the platform, and behind the stone screen, the words "Zhuge Liang's Pointing Generals Platform" are inscribed. Locals say that during his southern expedition, the Shuhan Prime Minister Zhuge Liang once pointed out generals and reviewed troops here. The platform still has holes for flagpoles and banners. Below the high platform is a flat and spacious dam, which can accommodate tens of thousands of soldiers for military exercises, giving the atmosphere of a parade ground. Above the Buddha statues is Daguanshan, with Han Dynasty rock foundations connected in a row on the mountain slope, caves where officials lived during the Wei and Jin dynasties, and various exquisite pavilions. At the top of the mountain, there is a beautifully designed Daguanshan Tower and a tea garden, providing a place for tourists to rest. The entire mountain is lush with bamboo and pine trees. Visitors can ascend the mountain along the winding stone steps, enjoying the scenic beauty.

    千佛岩
    袁道斌
    千佛岩位于四川夹江县城西三公里处。佛像刻在以“大观山”为主体的群山岩壁上，长约一华里，紧傍滔滔青衣江水，总数二千四百多尊，所以通称“千佛岩”。
    这里的佛像，始凿于隋，唐时最多，延及明清，跨时千载，因有“千年修成千佛岩”之说。盛唐时期造佛之风盛行，开元年间，当海通和尚在嘉州（乐山）凌云寺主持雕凿乐山大佛之先，夹江最大寺院毘卢寺的主持僧人就招募大批工匠，在青衣江边开山造佛。夹江造佛求其多，大大小小各具特色。众多佛像中，最具特色的有弥勒坐佛、净土变、昆沙门天王、观音等。弥勒坐佛身高八尺，造型精美，比例适当；慈祥和蔼，含笑欲语；在姿势、仪表、衣着等方面，颇似乐山大佛。文管所同志讲，弥勒坐佛先凿于乐山大佛，是乐山大佛的“小样”。
    除了弥勒坐佛，最引人注目的要数中段那被称为“极乐世界”的洞窟，简介牌上写明它的佛家标准是“净土变”。六尺左右见方的龛窟中，刻有二百七十余尊各种形象的佛像和楼台亭阁、宝塔经幢。正中端坐的说法佛像神态庄重、慈祥，佛座后面的圆形大背光图案十分精美。殿堂内外，楼阁上下，众多弟子有坐有立，肃然听道。佛像头顶是飞天仙女，飘然若飞。佛座前面对称地排列着一支庞大的乐队，或操琴弄管，或挥袖献舞，生动逼真，栩栩如生。
    与众多佛像相映生辉的，还有其它一些古迹。佛像脚下是一段秦汉时期的古栈道，道上条石被踩得光滑发亮，足见当年这条古道的繁荣景况。悬岩绝壁上，各种横题、竖书、长词、短句星罗棋布，或赞山光水色，或抒发揽胜情怀，草、隶、篆皆备，仿佛一个书法展览呈现在游客眼前。北边山坡下，有一块突起的巨石，高约四丈，形似高台，台前刻着“点将台”三字。台边有梯步通向台顶，台后的石砌屏风上题“诸葛亮点将台”。当地人说，蜀汉丞相诸葛亮当年南征之时，曾在此地点将阅兵。台上至今留着供杆旗竖帜用的洞穴。高台下面是平整宽阔的大坝，可容万千甲士演练排兵，甚有阅兵场气氛。佛像之顶有一座大观山，山腰有连接成片的汉代岩基，有魏晋时代僚人居住过的洞穴，有各种造型精致的亭台；山顶有一造型精巧的大观楼，有茶园，可供游览者休息。整座山竹青松茂，游人沿着蜿蜒曲折的盘山石阶上山，可以大饱眼福。
