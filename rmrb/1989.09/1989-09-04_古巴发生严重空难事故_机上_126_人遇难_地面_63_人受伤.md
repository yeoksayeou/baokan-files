Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 3rd.

A major aviation disaster occurred in Cuba. An Ilyushin-62 aircraft operated by Cubana de Aviación crashed this evening at 19:05 in the suburbs of Havana, the capital. All 115 passengers and 11 crew members on board were killed. Additionally, 63 people on the ground were injured.

The four-engine aircraft was scheduled to depart from Havana, stop in Cologne, West Germany, and then fly to Milan, Italy. However, it crashed shortly after taking off from José Martí International Airport in Havana. Among the 115 passengers, only 2 were Cuban citizens; the rest were West German and Italian tourists. The crash destroyed 20 houses on the ground and damaged a high-voltage power line. Due to the power line being severed, José Martí Airport was temporarily plunged into darkness.

Following the accident, a large number of rescue personnel rushed to the scene to provide aid. The Cuban government immediately established an accident investigation committee headed by the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, Rogelio. This is the most severe aviation disaster in Cuba in recent years.

    古巴发生严重空难事故
    机上126人遇难　地面63人受伤
    新华社哈瓦那9月3日电  古巴国家航空公司1架伊尔—62型飞机今晚19点05分在首都哈瓦那郊区坠毁，机上115名乘客和11名机组人员全部遇难，同时造成地面63人受伤。
    这架4引擎飞机预计从哈瓦那起飞，经联邦德国科隆飞往意大利米兰。但它从哈瓦那何塞·马蒂国际机场起飞数分钟后便坠毁，机上115名乘客中除2名古巴人外，其余都是联邦德国和意大利旅游者。飞机失事时砸毁地面20间民房，撞断1条高压输电线。由于高压输电线被撞断，何塞·马蒂机场一度陷于黑暗。
    事故发生后，大批救援人员紧急赶往现场抢救。古巴政府还立即成立了以民航局长罗赫里奥为首的事故调查委员会。　
    这是近年来古巴最大的一次空难事故。
