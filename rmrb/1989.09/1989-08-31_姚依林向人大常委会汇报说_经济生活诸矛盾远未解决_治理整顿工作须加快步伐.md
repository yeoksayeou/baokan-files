Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st.

Vice Premier Yao Yilin of the State Council said today that although the rectification and order work this year has achieved some results, the contradictions in economic life are still far from being resolved, and the difficulties are still great.

Yao Yilin said that the contradiction between total demand and total supply in society remains quite prominent. Although many measures have been taken this year to control investment demand, and considerable efforts have been made, the expected results have not been achieved. The main reasons are:

1. Extrabudgetary investments, especially local self-raised funds, have not been effectively controlled. Some regions have not strictly followed the State Council's requirements to put all ongoing projects into the planning "cage." Some projects that should have been suspended have not truly stopped, and some that have been announced as suspended are resuming construction. Some places are even continuing to build office buildings and other non-essential structures.

2. The problem of decentralized approval authority for construction projects has not been completely solved, and some places are still approving new projects beyond their authority.

3. Collective and individual investments have exceeded the planned control targets by a significant margin, and there is still a lack of effective control measures. The rapid growth in consumption demand has not been controlled. The growth in workers' wages and income still exceeds the growth in labor productivity, and the phenomenon of excessive issuance of bonuses, allowances, and goods is still quite serious. According to statistics from relevant departments, bank loans for wages and other personal expenditures from January to July increased by 22.9% compared to the same period last year; farmers' cash income in the first half of the year increased by 25.5%. Both of these growth rates are higher than the growth rates of production, national income, and fiscal revenue. The contradiction of unfair social distribution has not been alleviated. Although controlling the purchasing power of society has achieved some results, to complete the year's compression task, a great deal of effort is still needed.

He said that structural contradictions have not been alleviated and have even worsened in some aspects. Since 1984, when grain and cotton production had a bumper harvest, production has stagnated for several consecutive years. Although agricultural production may achieve good results this year, the agricultural production base is still relatively fragile, and the situation of agricultural and industrial imbalances remains quite serious. Although the excessively high industrial growth rate has declined somewhat this year, the unreasonable structure within the industry has not improved much:

1. Many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are facing significant production difficulties and have low growth rates. From January to July, the industrial output value of state-owned enterprises within the budget increased by approximately 5.8% compared to the same period last year, while the growth rate of collective-owned, especially township-owned, industries remains too high, reaching 21.7%.

2. The production of some products that need to be controlled is still increasing significantly. For example, the production of air conditioners in the first half of the year increased by more than 100% compared to the same period last year, and the production of household refrigerators, electric fans, and general machine tools is also growing too fast.

3. The growth rate of transportation is not adapting to the growth rate of industrial production, and the situation of transportation tension has worsened.

4. Industrial economic benefits have declined. Many enterprises have increased their per-unit product consumption and reduced product quality. Fixed asset investments, on the one hand, continue to expand extrabudgetary investments, many of which are general processing projects and non-production projects; on the other hand, a considerable number of key construction projects cannot proceed according to the planned schedule due to the lack of implementation of construction funds, and the task of adjusting the investment structure is still very heavy.

He said that the serious difficulties and problems in the national economy are not the result of one or two years but have accumulated over many years. They are the result of continuous over-allocation of national income for several years. The phenomenon of over-allocation of national income occurred in the second half of 1984, but at that time, the main leaders of the State Council did not acknowledge it and did not take effective measures to solve it, resulting in increasingly serious problems. At the end of 1983, the national currency circulation was only 53 billion yuan, and by the end of 1988, it had increased to 213.4 billion yuan, increasing by three times in five years, with an average annual growth rate of 32.1%, far exceeding the economic growth rate, making inflation increasingly severe. The facts show that the problems in the national economy are mainly the result of erroneous guiding ideology. It was only after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party that we were able to objectively analyze the problems in the economy, seriously summarize experiences and lessons, and truly carry out the work of rectification and order and deepening reform. Problems that have accumulated over many years cannot be solved in one year, but dragging them on is also not beneficial. We must, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, take more decisive measures to accelerate the pace of rectification and order, and strive to complete the rectification and order task within three years, including this year, to bring about a new turn in the national economy.

### 姚依林向人大常委会汇报说  经济生活诸矛盾远未解决  治理整顿工作须加快步伐

    姚依林向人大常委会汇报说
    经济生活诸矛盾远未解决
    治理整顿工作须加快步伐
    新华社北京8月31日电　国务院副总理姚依林今天说，今年的治理整顿工作虽已取得一定成效，但经济生活中存在的矛盾还远远没有解决，困难还是很大的。
    姚依林说，社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾仍然相当突出。今年在压缩投资需求方面虽然采取了很多措施，下了很大力量，但没有达到预期的成效。主要原因是：（1）预算外投资尤其是地方自筹投资仍然没有得到有效控制，一些地区没有认真按照国务院要求，把在建项目统统装进计划“笼子”里去。有些应该停缓建的地方项目没有真正停下来，有的已宣布停缓建的又在恢复建设；有的地方甚至还在继续兴建楼堂馆所。（2）建设项目审批权限过于分散的问题没有得到完全解决，一些地方还在越权审批新开工项目。（3）集体和个体投资比计划控制指标超出较多，还缺乏有效的控制办法。消费需求增长过快的势头没有控制住。职工工资收入的增长仍然超过劳动生产率的增长，滥发奖金、津贴、实物的现象还相当严重。据有关部门统计，1至7月份，银行对工资及个人其他支出比去年同期增长22.9％；上半年农民现金收入增长25.5％。两者的增长都高于生产的增长速度，高于国民收入和财政收入的增长速度。社会分配不公的矛盾还没有得到缓解。控制社会集团购买力虽然收到一定成效，但要完成全年的压缩任务，还需要做很大的努力。
    他说，结构性矛盾没有缓解，某些方面进一步加剧。我国粮食、棉花生产自1984年大丰收以后，连续几年徘徊不前，尽管今年农业有可能取得较好收成，但农业生产基础还比较脆弱，农业与工业不相适应的情况仍然相当严重。今年以来，过高的工业增长速度虽有回落，但工业内部的不合理结构并没有多少改善：（1）不少国营大中型企业生产困难较大，增长速度较低。1至7月份，预算内国营工业产值约比去年同期增长5.8％，而集体所有制特别是乡办工业增长速度仍然过快，高达21.7％。（2）一些需要控制生产的产品还在大幅度增长。比如，空调器产量上半年比去年同期增长1倍多，家用电冰箱、电风扇和一般机床等也都增长过快。（3）交通运输增长幅度与工业生产增长很不适应，运输紧张局面有所加剧。（4）工业经济效益有所下降。不少企业的单位产品消耗上升，产品质量下降。固定资产投资，一方面预算外投资继续膨胀，许多是搞一般加工项目和非生产性项目；另一方面，有相当一部分重点建设项目因为建设资金不落实，不能按计划进度施工，调整投资结构的任务还很繁重。
    他说，国民经济中存在的严重困难和问题，并不是一、两年内突然形成的，而是多年积累起来的，是连续几年国民收入超分配的恶果。国民收入超分配的现象1984年下半年就发生了，但是当时国务院主要负责同志不承认，也不采取有力的措施加以解决，致使问题越来越严重。1983年底全国货币流通量只有530亿元，1988年底增加到2134亿元，5年间增加了3倍，平均每年增长32.1％，大大超过了经济增长率，使通货膨胀愈演愈烈。事实说明，国民经济中出现的问题，主要是指导思想错误的结果。党的十三届四中全会以后，我们才有可能实事求是地分析经济中存在的问题，认真总结经验教训，真正把治理整顿和深化改革的工作进行下去。多年积累下来的问题，要在一年内解决是不可能的，但是久拖下去也不利。我们要按照十三届四中全会和邓小平同志讲话的精神，采取更加坚决果断的措施，加快治理整顿的步伐，力争用三年时间，包括今年在内，基本上完成治理整顿任务，使国民经济出现新的转机。
