    In recent years, the "inflation is harmless" theory has had a certain influence on China's monetary policy and has become one of the causes of inflation. However, the consequences of this theory have, in turn, mercilessly refuted the theory itself.

    **Recognizing the Harms of Inflation**

    The harms of inflation can be summarized in the following aspects:

    First, it is detrimental to the mobilization of construction funds. Savings deposits are one of the most important sources of national construction funds. Under the condition that the amount of national income is fixed, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of workers, the initial distribution should not exceed a reasonable limit to retain more accumulation funds and less consumption funds. Under this circumstance, whether it is possible to mobilize more funds to promote economic construction largely depends on the growth of savings deposits (including bonds). Savings deposits are a way of mobilizing funds that does not change people's ownership of money but temporarily transfers the use of money and pays a reward for this transfer. Using this method to mobilize funds can increase the amount of national construction funds and cultivate the frugal habits of the people, mobilizing people's enthusiasm to work hard and increase their income. However, savings deposits can only increase steadily and rapidly under the premise of stable currency value and prices, and that deposits not only preserve value but also increase a certain income. If inflation occurs, prices rise, and the interest rate is lower than the rate of price increase, savings deposits will not only not increase but will also decrease. Last year, the growth rate of savings deposits decreased month by month. In the first seven months, urban and rural savings increased nearly 400 million yuan less than the same period last year, and in August, it decreased by 260 million yuan compared to the previous month. The entire year saw a decrease of several hundred million yuan, and the reason is here. Although issuing more currency may increase a certain amount of monetary funds, due to inflation, all monetary funds will eventually depreciate, and savings deposits will also decrease. Therefore, overall, it will inevitably reduce economic construction funds.

    Second, it is detrimental to the full utilization of social resources. One of the basic factors determining the speed of China's socialist construction is the available construction resources. If construction resources are sufficient, the construction speed can be faster; if construction resources are insufficient, the construction speed can only be slowed down. The facts have fully proven that when inflation occurs and people expect prices to rise, they will try to occupy as many resources as possible, especially scarce resources. This leads to some enterprises having inventory resources exceeding normal needs, forming a backlog. This will make the limited social resources even less able to play their full role, and the shortage of resources will become more serious, and production and construction will be more constrained by resources.

    In the event of inflation, people value goods over currency, focusing on blindly buying goods, which will also impact the consumer goods market, artificially exacerbating the tension.

    Third, it is detrimental to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and to social stability and unity. When inflation and price increases occur, workers' actual income deviates from nominal income, and some people's actual income decreases. Even if the state compensates through price subsidies and other means, the loss due to currency depreciation is borne by residents' currency income, savings, and cash holdings, which do not fully correspond to the increased subsidies, and thus cannot compensate for everyone's losses. Engaging in inflation is equivalent to taking back part of the income that the masses have already obtained, which cannot but cause the masses' resentment.

    Fourth, it is detrimental to the reform of the system. The systemic reform that China is currently undergoing is a very complex and profound transformation that will inevitably have some impact on society. Therefore, to ensure that various reform measures are implemented smoothly, a stable monetary market is needed to mitigate this impact. However, inflation itself will produce a certain social impact and intertwine this impact with the impact of reform, increasing the frequency and amplitude of the impact. It may also make some people mistakenly believe that inflation and its harms are caused by systemic reform, thereby increasing resistance to systemic reform.

    **Analyzing the "Forced Savings" and "Utilizing Idle Resources" Theories**

    Those who insist on the "inflation is harmless" theory believe that inflation can play a role in "forced savings" and "fully utilizing idle resources." This is because they have not deeply studied China's national conditions, do not pay attention to the differences between capitalist countries and China, and mechanically apply Western economic theories.

    The "forced savings" effect of inflation exists in capitalist countries. There, when inflation occurs, currency depreciates, which is equivalent to levying an average tax on all currency holders, forming so-called "forced savings." However, in China, the "forced savings" that can be produced are very little, and compared to the normal savings deposits that are reduced as a result, it is not worth it. Currency holders in China can be roughly divided into the following categories: one category is state-owned enterprises (including old collective enterprises). The value of the currency they hold decreases due to depreciation. Under other unchanged conditions, it must be supplemented by fiscal allocations or increased bank loans; otherwise, their production and operation scale will shrink. One category is institutions, organizations, troops, and public service units that rely on fiscal allocations. To maintain normal activities, when the depreciation rate of their currency exceeds a certain limit, the fiscal authorities must increase corresponding allocations. One category is residents. The depreciated part of their currency is a state expropriation of individuals in capitalist society, which can form "forced savings," but this is not the case in China. The Chinese Communist Party and government do not want to lower the living standards of the people because of this, and when the price level rises, they will appropriately issue price subsidies; at the same time, before the issue of the "big pot" is completely resolved, each unit will actively take measures to increase various allowances for employees in various names to compensate for the losses suffered by employees due to currency depreciation. One category is private enterprises and individual economies, which have a small share in the national economy, and the "forced savings" that can be realized will not be much.

    Whether inflation is beneficial to the utilization of "idle resources," China and capitalist countries also have fundamental differences. The so-called utilization of "idle resources" is first the utilization of idle resources. The capitalist economy is an economy of relative surplus of commodities, and the biggest difficulty in its operation is insufficient effective demand, a narrow sales market, and difficulty in selling products. Under certain conditions, increasing the money supply there can increase effective demand, expand the sales market, and thus make it possible for some products that were originally difficult to sell and other idle resources to be utilized. However, China is an economy with a shortage of resources, with effective demand often being too large, and many resources are in short supply. Enterprises, fearing that they cannot buy them in time, and not paying attention to cost accounting, often prefer to bear the burden of loan interest and storage costs and occupy more resources. Under these circumstances, inflation will only make the supply of resources even tighter and drive people to seize more scarce resources, making resources even less able to be fully and reasonably used in actual production. Therefore, the higher the degree of inflation and the faster the price increase, the more scarce resources enterprises will accumulate, and the more severe the bottleneck phenomenon in the supply of raw materials for the production process will be. Next is the utilization of idle labor. Capitalist countries have a large number of unemployed people. If slow inflation can stimulate economic development, it can also increase a certain number of employed people. China's economic development speed is very fast, and the employment rate of urban labor is already very high. Under these conditions, trying to further accelerate the economic development speed and increase the employment rate through inflation, from an overall perspective, can be said to be both unnecessary and lacking in practical possibility.

    **Doubling Down on Guarding Against Inflation**

    In the process of transitioning from the old to the new economic system, there are forces within the economy that drive inflation. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to eliminating the influence of the "inflation is harmless" theory and doubling down on guarding against the impact of inflation.

    The dominant force in China's economy is state-owned enterprises. In state-owned enterprises, the factory directors and managers have not only fundamentally aligned interests with the workers but also have basically the same direct economic interests. This is the material foundation for factory directors and managers to unite all the workers to jointly manage the enterprise well. However, it is precisely because the economic interests of factory directors and managers are aligned with those of the workers that the enterprise may lose or weaken the self-control mechanism for consumption funds. At the same time, because China's economy is relatively backward, everyone hopes to accelerate the speed of economic development, and coupled with the lack of clear regulations on the political and economic responsibilities of fixed asset investment decision-makers for investment benefits, it makes it easier for some local, departmental leaders, and enterprise factory directors and managers to ignore economic benefits and blindly increase fixed asset investments.

    Before the economic system reform, the desire to increase consumption funds, that is, wages and bonuses, and the tendency to blindly expand fixed asset investments were both constrained by national plans and systems. Since the economic system reform, the autonomy of local and enterprise units has expanded, profits have increased, the original constraints have weakened, and new effective constraints have not yet formed. This makes it easy for consumption funds and fixed asset investments to grow too fast, thereby causing inflation.

    We must, through economic system reform, quickly establish an effective self-control mechanism within the economy for consumption funds and fixed asset investments. Of course, we cannot, like capitalist countries, suppress workers' wages and bonuses as much as possible; however, to maintain a certain amount of accumulation funds and eliminate inflation, it is completely necessary to reasonably control the growth rate of consumption funds. To this end, we can consider linking the direct economic interests of factory directors and managers with the overall interests of the state. When the profits and taxes paid to the state and the enterprise's accumulation increase, the wages and bonuses of factory directors and managers will correspondingly increase; when the profits and taxes paid to the state and the enterprise's accumulation decrease, the wages and bonuses of factory directors and managers will also correspondingly decrease. This can prompt factory directors and managers to take real responsibility for the growth of enterprise consumption funds and have a restraining effect. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish a system for fixed asset investment decision-makers to bear political and economic responsibilities for investment benefits. This way, it will be possible to better stop the excessive growth of fixed asset investments and consumption funds and eliminate the conditions for the occurrence of inflation.

    评“通货膨胀无害”论
    赵海宽
    近几年，“通货膨胀无害”论对我国的货币政策产生一定影响，成为发生通货膨胀的原因之一。然而，这种理论促成的后果，反过来又无情地否定了这种理论。
      正视通货膨胀的危害
    通货膨胀的危害，可以概括为以下几个方面：
    第一，不利于建设资金的筹集。储蓄存款是国家最重要的建设资金来源之一。在国民收入数量既定的条件下，为了鼓励劳动者的积极性，初次分配时不能超过合理界限多留积累资金，少留消费基金。在这种情况下，能否适当地多筹集一些资金，促进经济建设，就基本上取决于储蓄存款（包括债券）增长情况。储蓄存款是一种不改变人们对货币的所有权，只暂时让渡货币使用权，并对这种让渡支付报酬的筹资方式。用这种方法筹集资金，既能增加国家建设资金数量，又能培养人民群众艰苦朴素的风尚，调动人们努力工作、增加收入的积极性。然而储蓄存款只能在币值和物价稳定、存款不但能够保值而且可以增加一定收入的前提下，才能持续地、较快地增加。如果出现通货膨胀、物价上涨、利率低于物价上涨率的情况，储蓄存款不但不能增加，而且还要下降。去年储蓄存款增长幅度逐月降低，前七个月城乡储蓄比上年同期少增加近40亿元，8月份竟比上月减少26亿元，全年少增加几百亿元，其原因就在这里。靠多发货币虽然有可能增加一定量的货币资金，但由于通货膨胀不仅会使所有的货币资金迟早出现贬值现象，而且还会减少储蓄存款，因此，总起来看，它必然使经济建设资金减少。
    第二，不利于社会物资的充分利用。决定我国社会主义建设速度的一个基本因素是可供建设用的物资。建设物资充足，建设速度可以快些；建设物资缺乏，建设速度只能减慢。而事实已经充分证明，当出现通货膨胀，人们预期物价将上涨时，就会尽可能争取多占有物资，特别是紧俏物资。这导致部分企业库存的物资超过正常需要，形成积压。这会使社会仅有的物资，更加不能充分发挥作用，物资短缺的情况更加严重，生产建设受到物资的局限更大。
    在出现通货膨胀的情况下，人们重物轻币，侧重于盲目抢购商品，这对消费资料市场也会带来冲击，人为地加剧紧张。
    第三，不利于调动广大职工的劳动积极性，不利于社会的安定团结。发生通货膨胀和物价上涨，职工实际收入脱离名义收入，部分人的实际收入下降。即使国家通过物价补贴等办法加以弥补，也因货币贬值的损失是按居民的货币收入、拥有存款和现金数额分担，同增加的补贴并不能完全对应，从而并不能把每个人的损失都弥补起来。搞通货膨胀，无异于把群众已经到手的收入再收走一部分，这不能不引起群众的反感。
    第四，不利于体制改革。我国正在进行的体制改革，是一次极其复杂、深刻的变革，必然要对社会产生某种震动。因此，为了保证各项改革措施顺利进行，需要有一个稳定的货币市场，缓解这种震动。而通货膨胀本身就会产生一定的社会震动，并使这种震动同改革的震动交织在一起，加大震动的频率与幅度。还可能使部分人误认为通货膨胀及其危害是体制改革引起的，从而给体制改革增加阻力。
    “强迫储蓄论”和“利用闲置资源论”剖析
    坚持“通货膨胀无害论”的同志，认为通货膨胀可以发挥“强迫储蓄”和“充分利用闲置资源”的作用。这是他们没有深入研究我国国情，不重视资本主义国家同我国的区别，生搬硬套西方经济理论的表现。
    通货膨胀的“强迫储蓄”作用，在资本主义国家是存在着的，那里出现通货膨胀，货币贬值，就等于向所有货币持有者平均征税，形成所谓的“强迫储蓄”。而在我国能产生的“强迫储蓄”则很少，并且同因此而减少的正常储蓄存款相比，更是得不偿失的。我国货币持有者，大体可以划分为以下几类：一类是国营企业（包括老集体企业），它们持有的货币由于贬值而减少的价值，在其它条件不变的情况下，要由财政拨款或银行增加贷款补足，否则它们的生产和经营规模就会缩小。一类是依靠财政拨款的机关、团体、部队和事业单位，为了维持正常活动，在它们的货币的贬值率超过一定限度后，财政必须增加相应的拨款。一类是居民，他们的货币贬值部分，在资本主义社会是国家对个人的剥夺，可以形成“强迫储蓄”，而在我国则不然。我国党和政府不愿使群众的生活水平因此降低，在物价水平提高时，要适当增发物价补贴；同时在大锅饭问题没有彻底解决之前，各单位都会主动采取措施以各种名义给职工增加福利待遇，弥补职工因货币贬值而承受的损失。一类是私营企业和个体经济，它们在国民经济中的比重不大，能够实现的“强迫储蓄”也不会很多。
    通货膨胀是否有利于“闲置资源”的利用，我国同资本主义国家也有着根本性区别。所谓“闲置资源”的利用，首先是闲置物资的利用问题。资本主义经济是商品相对过剩的经济，运行过程最大的困难是有效需求不足，销售市场狭窄，产品销售困难。在一定的条件下，那里适度增加货币供应，可以加大有效需求，拓宽销售市场，从而使某些原来难以销售的产品和其它闲置资源有可能得到利用。而我国是物资短缺经济，有效需求经常过大，许多物资短缺，企业由于担心不能及时买到，加之不重视成本核算，往往宁愿承受贷款利息和保管费用的负担，而多占用物资。在这种情况下，通货膨胀只会使物资供应更加紧张，并推动人们更多地抢占紧缺物资，使物资更加不能充分而合理地使用于现实生产。因此，通货膨胀程度越高，物价上涨越快，企业积压的紧俏物资也会越多，生产过程原材料供应的瓶颈现象也就越加严重。其次是闲置劳动力的利用问题。资本主义国家存在大量失业人口，慢性通货膨胀既然可能刺激经济的发展，也就可能增加一定的就业人口。我国经济发展速度很快，城镇劳动力就业率已经很高。在这种条件下，想通过通货膨胀进一步加快经济发展速度，提高就业比率，从整体来看，可以说是既无必要，也缺乏现实可能。
    加倍警惕通货膨胀的冲击
    在新旧经济体制转换过程中，经济内部存在着推动通货膨胀的力量。因此，必须特别注意消除“通货膨胀无害”论的影响，加倍警惕通货膨胀的冲击。
    我国经济中占主导地位的是国营企业。在国营企业里，厂长、经理同职工不仅根本利益是一致的，连日常直接的经济利益也基本相同。这是厂长、经理能够团结全体职工，共同办好本企业的物质基础。然而也正由于厂长、经理的经济利益同职工一致，使企业有可能失去或削弱对消费基金的自控机制。同时，由于我国经济比较落后，大家都希望加快经济发展速度，加之没有明确规定固定资产投资决策者对投资效益的政治和经济的具体责任，就更使部分地方、部门领导人和企业厂长、经理容易忽视经济效益，盲目增加固定资产投资。
    在经济体制改革之前，这种多增加消费基金即工资、奖金的愿望和盲目扩大固定资产投资的倾向，都被国家计划和制度约束着。经济体制改革以来，地方、企业的自主权扩大，利润留成增加，原有的制约力削弱了，新的有效约束机制尚未形成。这就很容易使消费基金和固定资产投资增长过快，进而引起通货膨胀。
    我们要通过经济体制改革在经济内部尽快建立对消费基金和固定资产投资有效的自我约束机制。我们当然不能像资本主义国家那样，尽可能压低职工工资、奖金；然而为了保持一定的积累资金，消除通货膨胀现象，完全有必要合理控制消费基金的增长速度。为此可以考虑把厂长、经理的直接经济利益同国家整体利益挂起钩来，在上缴国家的利税和企业的积累增加时，厂长、经理的工资、奖金相应增加；在上缴国家的利税和企业的积累减少时，厂长、经理的工资、奖金也相应减少。这样，可以促使厂长、经理对企业消费基金的增长切实负起责任，产生约束作用。同时，还要建立固定资产投资决策者对投资效益承担政治和经济责任的制度。这样就有可能更好地制止固定资产投资和消费基金增长过快，消除出现通货膨胀的条件。
