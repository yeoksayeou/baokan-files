Compared to the first National Youth Games held four years ago, this event has added many new projects. However, water polo remains a relatively obscure sport that doesn't attract much attention. The reporter interviewed the head coach of the national water polo team, Guan Yue Zheng, by the pool to learn about the current state of water polo in China and the issues that need to be addressed.

Guan Yue Zheng told the reporter that China's water polo is at an intermediate level globally but has consistently maintained an advantage in Asia. In the past two Olympic Games, the Chinese water polo team has ranked around the tenth place. Since 1978, the Chinese team has won three consecutive championships in the Asian Games. Currently, the national team is preparing for next year's Asian Games to face the challenge from the Japanese team.

However, if China's water polo aims to catch up with the world's top teams and significantly improve its technical level, there are many challenges. Water polo is a team sport, and it's difficult to attract attention with so many players training and competing for just one gold medal, unlike swimming where an individual can win multiple medals. Therefore, even in departments with the conditions to develop water polo, this sport is not highly valued. There are only a few hundred water polo players nationwide, a number comparable to the number of water polo teams in the Soviet Union.

In this Youth Games, teams from Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, and Sichuan have some promising young players. However, their training history is relatively short, and they usually start playing water polo at the age of fifteen, with limited competition experience. The world's top teams play about seventy to eighty real matches each year, while the Chinese water polo team plays at most twenty to thirty matches. If this sport receives more attention and support, and is developed more widely, even tall young people from the north could join, making the future more promising.

### 水球——尚待普及的项目——访国家水球队领队关越铮

　　水球——尚待普及的项目
　　——访国家水球队领队关越铮
    与四年前的首届全国青运会相比，这次增加了不少项目，但是像水球仍然是个冷僻的项目，不大引人注意。记者在池边采访国家水球队领队关越铮，了解到我国水球运动的现状和有待解决的问题。
    关越铮向记者介绍说，中国水球运动在世界上处于中游，在亚洲则一直保持着优势。近两届奥运会，中国水球队都排在十名上下的位置上。从一九七八年以来，中国队是亚运会的三连冠。当前，国家队正在备战明年的亚运会，迎接日本队的挑战。
    不过，中国水球运动如果瞄准世界强队，大幅度提高技术水平，则有不少困难。水球是集体项目，那么多人练呀打呀，到头来也只能争一块金牌，不像游泳比赛，一个人就能拿好几块奖牌。因此，即使是有条件开展水球训练的体育部门，也不大重视这个项目。全国练水球的运动员不过几百人，人数与苏联拥有水球队的队数差不多。
    这次青运会上，广东、广西、上海和四川队都有些条件很好的苗子。可是，他们训练的历史较短，一般都从十五岁开始打水球，比赛经验很少。世界强队每年都要打七八十场实战，我国水球队最多也就是二三十场球。假如这个项目能够受到更多的重视和扶植，开展得更广泛些，身体高大的北方青年也来打水球，那么前景就会更为乐观。
