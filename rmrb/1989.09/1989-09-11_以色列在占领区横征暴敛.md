Recently, a group of Israeli soldiers and tax officials raided Ahmad's small shop in the West Bank, accusing him of owing taxes and demanding a fine of $250,000. However, the shop's annual income was only a few hundred dollars. Despite Ahmad's repeated pleas, the soldiers ransacked the place, seized his savings of $3,000, and left. Meanwhile, a university student named Adnan from a nearby village was suddenly detained and forced to pay his father's taxes. Adnan, who had no money, was repeatedly insulted and beaten. His ID was confiscated, and he had to wait in line for seven hours each day for a week to obtain a temporary ID.

Such incidents are common in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which are under Israeli occupation. In response to international criticism, Israeli authorities justified the increased taxation of Palestinians by claiming it was to compensate for the economic losses caused by Palestinian "destruction."

Since 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it has imposed numerous taxes in the occupied territories, including property tax, income tax, import tax, and business tax. According to international law, taxes collected by an occupying power should be used for the public utilities of the occupied region. However, Israel spends far less on public utilities in the occupied territories than it collects in taxes. Instead, it uses part of the collected taxes for its own territory or to settle Jewish immigrants.

In recent years, Israel has increased the number of taxes imposed on Palestinians and has become more brutal in its methods. There are now 25 different types of permits required, from driving a car to having a child, affecting everyone regardless of age or gender. Sometimes, obtaining a permit requires not only payment but also days of waiting in line. Last September, the Israeli authorities issued a new regulation requiring vehicle owners to pay a tax of $450. This single measure alone allows Israel to extract $24 million annually from Palestinians.

Israeli authorities do not follow legal procedures for taxation. Tax officials can arbitrarily seize property or impose fines, and even use armed forces for "night raids," breaking into homes at night to collect taxes. Israel also detains or fines the relatives, friends, and customers of taxpayers to force them to pay.

Israel's brutal exploitation of Palestinians can only provoke more determined resistance from them.

### 以色列在占领区横征暴敛

　　以色列在占领区横征暴敛
    不久前的一天，一群以色列士兵和税收官员闯进阿罕默德在约旦河西岸开设的小店，声称该店拖欠税金，要罚款25万美元。然而，这家小小的铺子一年的收入才数百美元。尽管店主一再求情，士兵们还是翻箱倒柜，大肆搜查，最后翻出了他仅有的3000美元积蓄，予以没收，才算罢休。接着，附近村镇的一个名叫阿旦的大学生突然被拘留，强令他替父亲偿付税金。可怜的阿旦身无分文，一再解释，得到的却是侮辱和拳打脚踢。结果，他的身份证被强行夺走。为此，他只得每天排队7个小时，用了一个星期才得到了一纸临时身份证。
    类似上述的事件在被以色列占领的加沙地带和约旦河西岸是司空见惯的。面对国际舆论的谴责，以色列当局居然这样辩解，增加对巴勒斯坦人的征税是为了弥补巴勒斯坦人“破坏”所造成的经济损失。
    以色列自从1967年占领约旦河西岸和加沙地带以来，在占领区设立了名目繁多的苛捐杂税，有财产税、所得税、进口税、营业税等等。根据国际法，占领者在占领区征得的税收应用于该地区居民的公用事业。然而，以色列当局花在占领区公用事业的费用远远少于税收所得。他们把从占领区征得的部分税收用于以色列本土或去安置犹太人移民。
    近年来，以色列对巴勒斯坦人征税的名目更多了，手段也更为凶狠了。他们颁发的许可证有25种之多，从驾驶汽车到生孩子都得有许可证，男女老少谁也逃不了。有时，为了领取一张许可证，巴勒斯坦居民不但要付钱，还得花几天的时间排队。去年9月，以色列当局还作了一项新的规定，汽车或其它交通工具的主人必须交纳450美元的税金。仅此一项，以色列当局一年就可从巴勒斯坦人身上榨取2400万美元。
    以色列当局从不按法律程序征税，税收官员可以任意没收或罚款，甚至动用武装力量进行所谓“夜袭”，即晚间闯入住家强行征税。以色列还对纳税人的亲戚、朋友、顾主等进行拘捕或罚款，逼纳税人交税。
    以色列当局对巴勒斯坦人进行残暴的压榨，只能激起巴勒斯坦人更坚决的斗争。
