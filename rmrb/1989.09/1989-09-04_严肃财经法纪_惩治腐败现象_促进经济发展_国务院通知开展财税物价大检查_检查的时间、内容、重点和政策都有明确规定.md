Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

The State Council issued a notice on August 31 to all provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments, as well as various ministries and commissions under the State Council, regarding the conduct of a nationwide tax, financial, and price inspection for 1989.

The notice states that while significant progress has been made in recent years through tax, financial, and price inspections, many units still have serious violations of financial and economic discipline, with some even repeatedly offending. This is a major cause of the proliferation of various corrupt practices and must be firmly stopped. Therefore, the State Council has decided to continue the nationwide tax, financial, and price inspection in 1989. The notice is as follows:

1. **Guidance for the Inspection**: The 1989 tax, financial, and price inspection is a major measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to rectify the economic environment, and to regulate economic order. Conducting this inspection well is of great significance for increasing state financial revenues, stabilizing market prices, combating corruption, and promoting sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. This is a major task in the new situation that concerns the overall situation. All levels of leadership should place this work in an important position, personally mobilize and deploy it, and study and solve related problems. All personnel participating in the inspection work should be spirited, work hard, and actively contribute to the completion of various inspection tasks. Through the inspection, we should collect the money that should be collected and reduce the expenditures that should be cut, to reduce the economic losses caused by turmoil and riots. In the work, we should combine the inspection with the fight against corruption and the strengthening of clean governance; combine it with the promotion of increased production and reduced expenditure, increased revenue and reduced expenditure activities; combine it with price control and the rectification of circulation order; combine it with the serious implementation of financial and economic discipline, the improvement of financial and economic systems, and the blocking of loopholes. This year's inspection work should be more in-depth, more solid, and more effective than in previous years.

2. **Time and Focus of the Inspection**: The 1989 tax, financial, and price inspection will begin in September and basically conclude by the end of the year. The scope of the inspection includes state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, and administrative and public institutions for violations of financial and economic discipline that occurred in 1989 and those that occurred in 1988 but were not inspected and rectified. In addition, for violations of discipline identified in the 1987 and 1988 inspections but not yet accounted for and deposited, a thorough inspection should also be conducted. The tax inspection of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the State Taxation Administration's (89) State Tax Collection Notice No. 039.

The main content of this inspection includes the following four aspects of illegal and disorderly behavior: (1) Various items of financial revenue that should be turned over. This includes tax evasion and tax fraud, unauthorized tax reductions and exemptions, improper cost allocation, embezzlement, interception, and private division of state revenue, false reporting of losses to obtain financial subsidies, and various illegal uses of financial funds in violation of state regulations. (2) Various off-budget funds. This includes converting on-budget funds to off-budget funds, converting state-owned funds to collective funds, establishing secret "small treasuries," and improperly using production funds for non-production expenditures. (3) Various price violations. This includes illegal price increases and surcharges, high-price resale of important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods, disguised price increases and surcharges, and illegal profiteering from price differences. (4) Various consumption funds. This includes excessive issuance of bonuses and subsidies, using public funds for banquets, gifts, travel, and the purchase of restricted and prohibited goods. Problems of personal borrowing of public funds should also be seriously investigated and recovered.

The key inspection targets are: various economic management departments and law enforcement agencies with confiscated income; large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and major profit and loss units, as well as collective enterprises with significant business income; companies engaged in commercial, material supply, financial, and foreign trade activities; departments and enterprises producing important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods. The key inspection coverage should not be less than 30%.

Efforts should be made to avoid duplicate inspections. Specific measures will be separately prescribed and issued by the Audit Office and the State Council's Tax, Financial, and Price Inspection Office.

3. **Several Policy Issues in the Inspection**: This inspection will continue to implement the principle of "self-inspection leniency, inspection severity, seeking truth from facts, and appropriate leniency and severity." Based on the current situation and existing problems, the following points should be emphasized:

   (1) Various levels of leadership departments should take the lead in inspecting various illegal and disorderly behaviors. In addition to seriously inspecting their own disciplinary violations, they should also strengthen the inspection work of their subordinate companies, enterprises, and public institutions. During the inspection, it is strictly forbidden to intercede, protect, or cover up. If there are such situations, they should be publicly exposed and severely punished. The various departments of the State Council are state agencies that exercise administrative powers on behalf of the state and should set an example by strictly enforcing discipline and actively inspecting and rectifying various disciplinary violations.

   (2) All departments, companies, enterprises, and units should seriously conduct self-inspections and prevent formalism. For disciplinary violations that are voluntarily inspected and corrected within the prescribed time limit and for which the disciplinary funds are fully paid, they can be legally treated leniently. If disciplinary violations are found due to inadequate self-inspection by higher-level dispatched personnel, they should be severely punished according to law.

   (3) For all kinds of illegal and disorderly behaviors that are found, they must be seriously dealt with in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations of the State Council on the Punishment for Violations of Financial Regulations," the "Price Management Regulations of the People's Republic of China," and other relevant financial, tax, price, and foreign exchange punishment regulations, without any exceptions or leniency. Various units using their own funds for illegal and disorderly behaviors should also be strictly investigated and dealt with.

   (4) Various forms of "small treasuries" are an important cause of illegal and disorderly behaviors and should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with. Funds from illegal sources should be confiscated; improper use should be fined; and for serious cases, the relevant leaders and responsible persons should be held accountable. The specific measures for the investigation of "small treasuries" will be issued by the Ministry of Finance for implementation.

   (5) Various items of disciplinary income that should be turned over must be deposited in a timely manner and should not be intercepted or misappropriated. If there is any refusal to deposit, the bank should assist in the transfer.

   (6) Various levels of inspection offices should strengthen coordination and cooperation with the supervision departments, disciplinary inspection agencies, and procuratorates and courts. For illegal and disorderly behaviors that are found, in addition to economic penalties, the relevant leaders and responsible persons should also be dealt with according to party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal discipline.

   (7) For enterprises and units that deliberately falsify information, knowingly commit serious illegal and disorderly behaviors, they cannot be rated as advanced; the relevant responsible persons and financial personnel cannot be rated for professional technical titles.

4. **Organization and Leadership of the Inspection Work**: The people's governments of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the central departments should designate a provincial or ministerial-level leader to be responsible for this work, establish and improve the inspection leading group, and dispatch strong work teams and inspection teams to supervise and inspect. The State Council will also select a group of capable cadres from the central departments to form work teams to assist and promote the work. The State Council's Inspection Office will continue to entrust local authorities to inspect central enterprises and public institutions. Various levels of financial, tax, audit, and price departments should, in addition to doing a good job in their daily work, concentrate their efforts on the inspection. Other relevant departments and news units should actively support and cooperate, and warmly welcome the participation of NPC, CPPCC, and democratic party members in the inspection work, working together to do a good job in the 1989 tax, financial, and price inspection.

The transparency of the investigation and punishment of various illegal and disorderly behaviors should be improved. For all problems found, the disciplinary situation and the handling decision should be publicly posted in the unit, and depending on the severity of the case, it should be criticized and reported in the region, department, or nationwide. For cases with serious nature and heinous circumstances, they should be publicly exposed and handled through newspapers, radio, television, and other news media. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and planned single-list cities should publicize a number of typical cases to play the role of social public opinion supervision. Various levels of tax, financial, and price inspection offices should only be strengthened and not weakened. All levels of people's governments should, in accordance with the provisions of the State Council's (1988) No. 65 document, determine the staffing of the office and fill the positions. Those that have not yet determined the staffing should do so immediately; those that have already determined the staffing should further improve the organization and strengthen the personnel. All personnel participating in the inspection work should uphold principles, act impartially, strictly observe discipline, and set an example of integrity and honesty. The State Council's Inspection Office will continue to commend a group of advanced individuals participating in the inspection work, and various regions and departments should also do a good job in this aspect.

The daily work of the nationwide tax, financial, and price inspection will be handled by the State Council's Inspection Office. After the inspection is completed, various regions and departments should submit a summary report to the State Council and also send a copy to the State Council's Inspection Office.

    严肃财经法纪　惩治腐败现象　促进经济发展
    国务院通知开展财税物价大检查
    检查的时间、内容、重点和政策都有明确规定
    新华社北京9月4日电　国务院于8月31日向各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府，国务院各部委、各直属机构发出关于开展1989年税收、财务、物价大检查的通知。
    通知说，近几年进行的税收、财务、物价大检查，取得了很大成绩。但不少单位违反财经法纪的问题仍较严重，甚至屡查屡犯。这是造成各种腐败现象滋长、蔓延的重要原因之一，必须坚决予以制止。为此，国务院决定，1989年继续在全国范围内开展税收、财务、物价大检查。现通知如下：
    一、检查的指导思想。1989年的税收、财务、物价大检查，是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的一项重大措施。搞好这次大检查，对于增加国家财政收入，稳定市场物价，惩治腐败现象，促进经济的持续、稳定、协调发展，具有重要的意义。这是在新形势下事关全局的一件大事，各级领导要把这项工作摆到重要位置，亲自动员部署，研究解决有关问题。所有参加大检查工作的人员都要振奋精神，努力工作，为圆满完成大检查的各项任务作出积极贡献。要通过大检查，把该收的钱收上来，该压的支出压下去，以减少动乱和暴乱造成的经济损失。在工作中，要把大检查同惩治腐败、加强廉政建设结合起来；同开展增产节约、增收节支活动结合起来；同控制物价、整顿流通秩序结合起来；同严肃财经法纪、完善财经制度、堵塞漏洞结合起来。今年的大检查工作，要比往年搞得更深入、更扎实、更有成效。
    二、检查的时间和重点。今年的税收、财务、物价大检查，从9月份开始到年底基本结束。检查的范围，包括国营企业、集体企业，以及行政事业单位在1989年发生的违反财经法纪问题和1988年发生而未检查纠正的违反财经法纪问题。此外，对于1987年、1988年大检查中查出而尚未调帐入库的各项违纪问题，也要认真进行检查。个体工商业户和私营企业的税收检查，按国家税务局（89）国税征字第039号《通知》的规定进行。
    这次大检查的内容，主要检查以下四个方面的违法乱纪问题：（一）各项应交财政收入。包括偷税漏税和越权减免税，乱挤成本，侵占、截留、私分应交国家收入，虚报亏损、骗取财政补贴，以及违反国家规定乱开口子、乱支各项财政资金等。
  （二）各项预算外资金。包括化预算内为预算外，化全民为集体，私设“小金库”，以及擅自挪用生产性资金搞非生产性开支等。（三）各种违价问题。包括违反国家规定乱涨价、乱收费，高价转手倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品，以及变相涨价、加价，非法牟取价差收入等。（四）各项消费基金。包括滥发奖金、补贴和实物，用公款请客送礼、游山玩水、购建私房，乱买控购、禁购商品等。对私人借支公款的问题，也要认真清理、收回。
    检查的重点对象是：各级经济主管部门和有罚没收入的执法机关；国营大中型企业和盈亏大户，以及经营收入较多的集体企业；从事商业、物资供销、金融、外贸等活动的公司；生产经营重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品的部门和企业。重点检查面不应少于30％。
    要尽量避免重复检查，具体办法，由审计署和国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室另行规定，下达执行。
    三、检查中的几个政策问题。这次大检查，要继续执行“自查从宽，被查从严，实事求是，宽严适度”的原则。根据当前的实际情况和存在的问题，要特别强调以下几点：
      （一）各级领导部门要带头检查各种违法乱纪问题。除认真检查自身的违纪行为外，还要加强对所属公司、企业和事业单位的检查工作。在检查中，严禁说情袒护，徇私包庇。如有这类情况，要公开揭露，从严查处。国务院各部门是代表国家行使职权的业务主管机关，要以身作则，严于律己，主动检查纠正各种违纪问题，为全国作出表率。
     （二）所有部门、公司、企业和单位，都要认真进行自查，严防走过场。对于在规定期限内，主动检查、纠正的违纪问题，在如数补交违纪款项后，可依法从宽处理。如因自查不力而被上级派人检查出来的违纪问题，要依法从严惩处。
      （三）凡属被查出来的各种违法乱纪问题，都要坚决按照《国务院关于违反财政法规处罚的暂行规定》、《中华人民共和国价格管理条例》以及其他有关财税、物价、外汇的处罚规定严肃处理，不得变通，不能手软。各单位用自有资金搞违法乱纪的，也要严格查处。
      （四）各种形式的“小金库”，是产生违法乱纪行为的一个重要原因，要花大力气进行清理、检查。资金来源不合法的，要坚决予以没收；使用不当的，要处以罚款；情节严重的，还要追究有关领导和当事人的责任。清查“小金库”的具体办法，由财政部下发执行。
      （五）各项应交违纪收入，要保证优先入库，不得截留、挪用。如有拒不交库的，请银行协助划拨。
      （六）各级大检查办公室要加强同监察部门、纪检机关和检察、法院等协调配合。对于查出的违法乱纪问题，除给予经济处理外，还要按照有关规定，做好对有关领导和责任人员的党纪、政纪、法纪的处理工作。
      （七）对于有意弄虚作假，明知故犯，严重违法乱纪的企业和单位，不能上等级、评先进；有关责任人员和财会人员，不能评定专业技术职称。
    四、检查工作的组织领导。各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府和中央各部门，都要指定一名省、部级领导干部负责这项工作，建立、健全大检查领导小组，派出强有力的工作组和检查组进行督促检查。国务院仍将从中央部门抽调一批得力干部，组成工作组下去协助和推动工作。国务院大检查办公室将继续委托地方搞好检查中央企事业单位的工作。各级财政、税务、审计、物价部门，在大检查期间，除了搞好日常工作外，要集中力量投入大检查。其他有关部门和新闻单位，也要积极支持和配合，并热忱欢迎人大、政协和民主党派人士参加大检查工作，同心协力，把今年的税收、财务、物价大检查工作搞好。
    要提高查处各种违法乱纪问题的透明度。凡属被查出来的问题，都要将违纪情况和处理决定在本单位张榜公布，并视其情节轻重，分别在地区、部门或全国范围内通报批评。性质严重、情节恶劣的案件，还要通过报刊、电台、电视等各种新闻媒介，公开揭露，公开处理。各省、自治区、直辖市和计划单列市，都要抓一批典型案件公布于众，发挥社会舆论的监督作用。各级税收、财务、物价大检查办公室，只能加强，不能削弱。各级人民政府都要按照国务院（1988）65号文件的规定，给办公室核定编制，配齐人员。尚未定编配员的，要立即定编配员；已经定编的，要进一步健全机构，充实人员。所有参加大检查工作的人员，要坚持原则，秉公办事，严守纪律，做清正廉洁的模范。国务院大检查办公室将继续表彰一批参加大检查工作的先进个人，各地区、各部门也要做好这方面的工作。
    全国税收、财务、物价大检查的日常工作，由国务院大检查办公室负责。大检查结束后，各地区、各部门都要向国务院写出总结报告，同时抄送国务院大检查办公室。
