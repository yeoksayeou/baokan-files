Twenty athletes competed in the 52 kg class, but the main competition was between Bulgarian athlete Ivan Ivanov and Chinese athlete He Zhuqiang. In the snatch, both Ivanov and He Zhuqiang lifted 117.5 kg. He Zhuqiang won the gold medal due to his slightly lighter weight, while Ivanov took the silver. In the clean and jerk, Ivanov successfully lifted 155 kg on his third attempt, breaking He Zhuqiang's world record of 153 kg. At the same time, Ivanov set a new world record with a total score of 272.5 kg, surpassing his teammate Marinov's 270 kg total score from the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He Zhuqiang only successfully lifted 145 kg on his first attempt and failed on his subsequent attempts to lift 147.5 kg and 150 kg, ultimately securing the silver medal with a total score of 262.5 kg.

In the 56 kg class, Soviet athlete Khafiz Suleymanov emerged as a surprise winner, defeating all 26 of his opponents with a snatch of 157.5 kg and a total score of 287.5 kg to win the gold medals in both events. His snatch score was the same as Chinese athlete Liu Shoubin's, both lifting 130 kg, but Suleymanov took the silver due to his heavier weight. Liu Shoubin won the gold medal in the snatch. He also secured the silver medal in the total score with 285 kg.

　　保苏大力士夺走世界举重锦标赛头两个级别总成绩金牌
　　何灼强刘寿斌各获一项抓举冠军
    新华社雅典9月16日电  （记者李成贵）第五十九届世界暨第六十七届欧洲举重锦标赛今天在这里揭开战幕。保加利亚选手伊万·伊万诺夫破52公斤级挺举和总成绩世界纪录，苏联选手哈菲兹·苏莱曼诺夫夺56公斤级挺举和总成绩金牌，中国选手何灼强和刘寿斌分获这两个级别的抓举冠军。
    20名选手参加了52公斤级的角逐，但争夺主要在保加利亚选手伊万·伊万诺夫和中国选手何灼强之间进行。在抓举比赛中，伊万诺夫和何灼强都举起了117.5公斤重的杠铃。结果何灼强因体重稍轻而获冠军，伊万诺夫获亚军。在这个级别挺举比赛中，伊万诺夫第三次试举举起了155公斤，打破了何灼强保持的153公斤的挺举世界纪录。与此同时，伊万诺夫以272.5公斤的总成绩刷新了队友马林诺夫在去年汉城奥运会上创造的270公斤的总成绩世界纪录。何灼强仅第一次试举145公斤成功，在随后试举147.5公斤和150公斤均告失败，最后以262.5公斤获总成绩亚军。
    在56公斤级比赛中，苏联选手哈菲兹·苏莱曼诺夫异军突起，出人意料地战胜全部26名对手，以157.5公斤和287.5公斤的成绩夺得挺举和总成绩两枚金牌。他抓举成绩与中国选手刘寿斌的一样，都是130公斤，因体重而屈居亚军。刘寿斌夺得抓举金牌。他还以285公斤获总成绩亚军。
