North Korea's Foreign Ministry Issues Statement
Strongly Demanding U.S. Withdrawal of Troops from South Korea

Pyeongyang, September 7th - Correspondent Xu Baokang reports: The North Korean Foreign Ministry today issued a statement, once again strongly demanding that the United States withdraw all its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and provide a timetable for the withdrawal as soon as possible.

The statement said that U.S. troops have been occupying South Korea for 44 years. Currently, the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea have done nothing but obstruct the unification of Korea, shield and support the military fascist dictatorship in South Korea, and plot to provoke a new war.

The statement emphasized that the United States has no justification for maintaining its troops in South Korea. Internationally, regional conflicts are being resolved by withdrawing foreign troops, and the Korean issue is no exception.

The statement further pointed out that even from the perspective of the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region, the United States has no reason or excuse to deploy a large number of invasion forces in South Korea and conduct large-scale joint military exercises every year.

The statement reiterated that resolving the issue of national unification through dialogue and consultation is our consistent stance, and there is no military threat from the North. We have repeatedly stated that we will not "invade the South."

The statement urged the United States and the South Korean authorities to respond to North Korea's proposal for "three-party talks."

    朝鲜外交部发表声明
    强烈要求美国撤走驻南朝鲜美军
    本报平壤9月7日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜外交部今天发表声明，再次强烈要求美国从南朝鲜撤走一切军队和核武器，并早日拿出撤军的“时间表”。
    声明说，美军强占南朝鲜已经44年。现在，驻南朝鲜美军除阻挡朝鲜的统一，庇护、助长南朝鲜的军事法西斯独裁，策划挑动新战争外，没有干过任何事情。
    声明强调，美国没有任何名义在南朝鲜保留自己的军队。在国际上，地区纷争问题正以撤出外国军队为基本环节而获得解决，朝鲜问题不能例外。
    声明进而指出，即使从朝鲜半岛和亚太地区的形势来看，美国也没有任何理由和借口在南朝鲜配备大量的侵略武力，每年进行大规模的联合军事演习。
    声明重申，通过对话和协商，和平解决国家的统一问题，是我们一贯的立场，不可能存在来自北方的军事威胁。我们不止一次地阐明过不会“南侵”。
    声明敦促美国和南朝鲜当局响应朝鲜北方提出的“三方会谈”的建议。
