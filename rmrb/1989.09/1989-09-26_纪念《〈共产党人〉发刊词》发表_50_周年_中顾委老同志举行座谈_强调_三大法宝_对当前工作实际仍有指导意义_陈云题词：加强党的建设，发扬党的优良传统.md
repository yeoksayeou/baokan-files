The Communist Party of China's Central Propaganda Department's "Party Building" magazine recently invited several senior comrades from the Central Advisory Commission to hold a symposium to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the early theoretical journal of the Communist Party, "The Communist Party," and the 50th anniversary of Mao Zedong's "The Word on the Occasion of the Founding of the Communist Party."

At the request of the "Party Building" magazine, Comrade Chen Yun inscribed: "Strengthen Party building and carry forward the Party's fine traditions."

Those who attended the symposium included Wang Shudao, Liu Lantao, and others. A responsible comrade from the Central Propaganda Department presided over the symposium.

Several senior comrades in their speeches pointed out that the three magic weapons for the Chinese revolution proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in "The Word on the Occasion of the Founding of the Communist Party" still have practical significance for guiding current work. The core of the three magic weapons is Party building, which is the fundamental guarantee for implementing the Party's political line. However, for a period of time, due to neglecting Party building and weakening Party leadership, it has caused confusion in Party ideology, improper Party style, impure organization, lax discipline, and serious corruption, thereby weakening the Party's cohesion and fighting strength, and causing great damage to the Party's image and prestige. The occurrence of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion is closely related to the Party's scattered state. This serious lesson must be seriously drawn, and great efforts must be made to strengthen Party building, to rectify and purify the Party's ranks, to strictly enforce Party discipline, to truly implement the principle of strict governance of the Party, and to resolutely solve the problem of unqualified Party members, thereby enhancing the Party's cohesion and fighting strength.

The senior comrades present mentioned that the Communist Party is a ruling party with 48 million members, so the issue of Party style is a matter of life and death for the Party and must not be taken lightly. The Party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the faithful representative and defender of the interests of the broad masses of the people, with no private interests of its own. Therefore, the Party must place itself under the supervision of the people. Party members and cadres, especially high-ranking cadres, must consciously accept supervision. Only in this way can major mistakes be avoided, and mistakes, if made, can be corrected in a timely manner.

The senior comrades in their speeches believed that strengthening Party building must rectify Party style. The good or bad of Party style directly affects social ethics. The key to rectifying Party style is to enhance Party members' sense of Party identity, which is a necessary guarantee for implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies. The strength and role of the Communist Party mainly lie in the quality of its members, not in their quantity. Therefore, it is necessary to educate the broad masses of Party members to always remember the Party's purpose, to serve the people wholeheartedly, to strengthen the education of Party members in Marxist-Leninist basic theory, to adhere to the education of the four cardinal principles, to continue and carry forward the Party's fine traditions and style, to truly play the role of Party members as vanguards and models, and to better fulfill the historical mission of uniting and leading the people of the whole country to build socialist modernization.

At the symposium, these senior comrades also expressed their opinions on further improving the "Party Building" magazine.

    纪念《〈共产党人〉发刊词》发表50周年
    中顾委老同志举行座谈
    强调“三大法宝”对当前工作实际仍有指导意义
    陈云题词：加强党的建设，发扬党的优良传统
    新华社北京9月25日电  中共中央宣传部《党建》杂志社最近邀请中顾委的一些老同志座谈，纪念党的早期理论刊物《共产党人》创刊50周年和毛泽东同志《〈共产党人〉发刊词》发表50周年。
    应《党建》杂志社的请求，陈云同志为纪念毛泽东同志《〈共产党人〉发刊词》发表50周年题词：“加强党的建设，发扬党的优良传统。”
    出席座谈会的老同志有王首道、刘澜涛等。中宣部负责同志主持了座谈会。
    一些老同志在发言中指出，毛泽东同志在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》这篇文章中提出的中国革命的三大法宝，对指导当前的工作实际仍有现实意义。三大法宝中核心是党的建设，这是实现党的政治路线的根本保证。但是，一个时期以来，由于忽视党的建设，淡化党的领导，造成党内思想混乱，党风不正，组织不纯，纪律松弛，腐败现象严重，从而削弱了党的凝聚力和战斗力，使党的形象、党的威信蒙受了很大损失。这次动乱和反革命暴乱的发生，就同党的涣散状况有很大关系。这个严重的教训，必须认真汲取，要下大力气加强党的建设，从思想上、组织上、作风上正本清源，纯洁党的队伍，严明党的纪律，真正做到从严治党，坚决解决不合格党员的问题，增强党的凝聚力和战斗力。
    与会老同志们谈到，共产党是拥有4800万党员的执政党，因此，党风问题是关系到党的生死存亡的大问题，决不可掉以轻心。党是无产阶级的先锋队，是广大人民利益的忠实代表者和捍卫者，没有自己的任何私利。所以，党必须把自己置于人民的监督之下。党员干部、特别是高级干部更要自觉接受监督。只有这样，才能避免犯大的错误，出现错误也容易及时得到纠正。
    老同志们在发言中认为，加强党的建设一定要端正党风，党风的好坏直接影响到社会风气。而端正党风的关键是增强党员的党性观念，这是贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策的必要保证。共产党的力量和作用，主要不在于党员的数量，而在于党员的素质。因此，要教育广大党员时刻牢记党的宗旨，全心全意为人民服务，加强对党员的马列主义基本理论教育，坚持四项基本原则的教育，继续和发扬党的优良传统和作风，真正发挥党员的先锋模范作用，更好地完成团结带领全国人民进行社会主义现代化建设的历史使命。
      座谈会上，这些老同志还就进一步办好《党建》杂志发表了意见。
