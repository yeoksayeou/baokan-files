    The great changes in Tibet have attracted overseas Tibetans. In the past ten years, more than 7,000 overseas Tibetans have returned to the Tibetan, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan regions. Among them, 6,200 have returned to visit relatives, and 1,200 have settled down.

    In recent years, a large number of overseas Tibetans have returned to their homeland to visit relatives, tour, or settle down, attracted by China's reform and opening-up policy and the Communist Party's policies on ethnic minorities, religion, and united front work. They have witnessed the great changes in Tibet.

    Today, at the National Day tea party for returned overseas Tibetans held in Lhasa, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference Zheng Ying said: "Since September 1987, our embassies abroad have temporarily suspended the issuance of visas for overseas Tibetans to return to visit relatives. This is a temporary measure taken to stop a few splittist elements from engaging in sabotage activities."

    Zheng Ying emphasized: "The Communist Party's reform and opening-up policy will not change, and the policy of free coming and going for overseas Tibetans will not change. As long as they support national unity, hope for peace and prosperity in their hometowns, and are willing to contribute to this, they will naturally be welcomed by the people of their motherland."

    藏区巨变吸引海外游子
    归国藏胞十年超过七千
    本报拉萨9月25日电  记者刘伟报道：自1979年以来，回归藏、川、青、甘、滇藏区的国外藏胞已达7400多人，其中6200多人探亲，1200多人定居。
    这些年，大批国外藏胞在祖国改革开放和共产党民族、宗教、统战政策的吸引下，归国探亲、参观或定居，目睹了藏区巨变。
    今天在拉萨市举行的西藏归国藏胞国庆茶话会上，西藏自治区政协副主席郑英说：“1987年9月以来，我驻外使馆暂停国外藏胞回国探亲的签证工作，这是为制止少数分裂主义分子进行破坏活动所采取的一项临时措施。”
    郑英强调说：“党的改革开放政策决不会变，国外藏胞来去自由的政策也不会变，只要拥护祖国统一，希望自己家乡安宁、繁荣发展，并愿意为此而作出贡献的，都理所当然地受到祖国人民的欢迎。”
