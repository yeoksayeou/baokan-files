Libyan and Chadian Foreign Ministers Sign Peace Agreement, Aouzou Issue to be Arbitrated Internationally

CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) — Our reporter Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo: The foreign ministers of Libya and Chad today signed a peace agreement in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, agreeing to submit the Aouzou issue to international arbitration.

The Aouzou region covers an area of 114,000 square kilometers and is located in the central-western section of the Libyan-Chadian border. The two countries have differing views on the ownership of the region, leading to multiple armed conflicts. In June 1973, Libya sent troops to occupy the Aouzou region, escalating the conflict between the two countries.

Relations between Libya and Chad began to ease last May. The leaders of the two countries met in Bamako, the capital of Mali, a month ago to discuss the border dispute but did not reach an agreement. Last week, representatives of the two countries held secret talks in France.

It is reported that the peace agreement reached includes inviting African peacekeeping forces to enter the Aouzou region to supervise the implementation of the results of international arbitration.

    乍利外长签署和平协议
    奥祖问题交付国际仲裁
    本报开罗8月31日电　记者林皎明报道：利比亚和乍得两国外长今天在阿尔及利亚首都阿尔及尔就解决两国边境争端签署和平协议，一致同意将奥祖问题交付国际仲裁。
    奥祖地区面积11.4万平方公里，位于利乍边境中西段。利乍两国在该地区归属问题上存在分歧，进而导致多次武装冲突。1973年6月，利比亚出兵占领奥祖地区，两国冲突升级。
    利乍两国关系从去年5月开始缓和。两国领导人1个月前曾在马里首都巴马科会谈边境争端问题，没有取得成果。上周，两国代表在法国进行秘密会谈。
    据透露，目前达成的和平协议包括邀请非洲维持和平部队进驻奥祖地区，督促执行国际仲裁结果。
