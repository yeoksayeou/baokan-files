Tibet Advances on the Socialist Path

Tibet Autonomous Region Chairman Duoji Cairang

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 30th anniversary of democratic reform in Tibet.

Three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government and the local government of Tibet signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." Tibet was thus peacefully liberated, marking a crucial step in Tibet's liberation from imperialist aggression and oppression, and its journey from darkness to light and happiness. In 1959, after the upper echelons of the Tibetan reactionary clique tore up the agreement, betrayed the motherland, and instigated an armed rebellion, the Central Government decided, with the strong support of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and the approval of patriotic upper-class figures, to carry out democratic reform while suppressing the rebellion. Democratic reform was a profound revolution in Tibet's social development. This revolution abolished the feudal serf system, liberated the Tibetan people, and paved the way for Tibet's prosperity and progress on the socialist road.

In the 30 years since democratic reform, Tibet has undergone tremendous changes. Although Tibet is still relatively backward and impoverished compared to other provinces and autonomous regions in the country, and there are still many pressing problems and difficulties to be solved in its progress, the great achievements Tibet has made in various fields over the past 30 years have attracted worldwide attention and are unparalleled in any previous historical period.

The Tibetan people have become masters of their own house, and the system of regional ethnic autonomy has been continuously improved. After the democratic reform, various levels of grassroots government organizations were established throughout the region. The broad masses of people who were once oppressed and enslaved became the masters of the new society. In 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region was officially established, realizing the ethnic autonomy rights granted to ethnic minorities by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in Tibet. Since the implementation of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional Ethnic Autonomy," the system of regional ethnic autonomy has been further improved. The region has successively formulated some local regulations and implemented a series of special policies different from other provinces in the country. The study and use of ethnic languages and scripts have been emphasized. Ethnic customs and religious beliefs have been respected. A cadre and staff team with Tibetans as the mainstay has been formed, and a large number of ethnic cadres have taken up leading positions at various levels.

Economic construction has been continuously developed, and people's living standards have gradually improved. Democratic reform abolished the old system, realized the transformation of production relations, and liberated social productive forces. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the implementation of reform and opening up has promoted economic development. In 1988, compared to 1959, the total agricultural output value increased nearly fourfold. Modern industry has gone from nonexistent to the establishment of more than 260 industrial enterprises in fields such as electricity, mining, construction, building materials, light industry, woolen textiles, printing, and food. With the strong support of the state, Tibet's transportation, postal services, commerce, foreign trade, and tourism have also made significant progress. On the basis of economic development, people's living standards have gradually improved. Now, the basic food problem for the majority of farmers and herdsmen in the region has been basically solved. The basic living needs of the impoverished population have been guaranteed through poverty alleviation and relief work. In 1988, the per capita income of farmers and herdsmen reached 380 yuan.

Education, science and technology, culture, and health care have developed rapidly, promoting the progress of the nation and society. Before liberation, Tibet had only a few schools for the children of the nobility, but now there are more than 2,500 schools of various types with over 170,000 students enrolled. Cultural undertakings are becoming more prosperous. Significant achievements have been made in the study of Tibetan studies and the rescue and organization of traditional cultural heritage. Radio and television have developed rapidly, and a three-level mixed coverage network of autonomous region, prefecture, and county has been established. Science and technology, news publishing, health, and sports have also developed to varying degrees.

All the achievements made in Tibet's democratic reform over the past 30 years are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the strong support of all the brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland, and the Tibetan people's striving forward on the socialist road. Practice has proven that without the Communist Party of China, there would be no liberation of the Tibetan people; without the motherland, there would be no development and progress of the ethnic groups; without the socialist road, there would be no bright future for Tibet. Any behavior that opposes the four cardinal principles, damages national unity, and ethnic solidarity is against the historical trend and the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people and is doomed to fail. Tibet independence is not feasible, semi-independence is not feasible, and disguised independence is not feasible. This is the answer of history and the voice of the people.

To ensure the stable, coordinated, and sustainable development of Tibet's social economy, the autonomous region is currently studying and formulating strategic plans and long-term goals for social and economic development. The Tibetan people of all ethnic groups will continue to work hard and strive for self-reliance under the correct leadership and warm care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adhering to the "one center, two basic points," and painting a new picture.

　　西藏在社会主义道路上前进
    西藏自治区主席　多吉才让
    今年，是中华人民共和国成立40周年，也是西藏实行民主改革30周年。
    中华人民共和国成立后的第三年，中央人民政府与西藏地方政府签定了《关于和平解放西藏办法的协议》，西藏得到了和平解放。这是西藏永远摆脱帝国主义侵略和羁绊、从黑暗和痛苦走向光明和幸福的关键性的第一步。1959年，西藏上层反动集团撕毁协议、背叛祖国、掀起武装叛乱后，在广大藏族人民的强烈要求和上层爱国人士的赞同下，中央决定在平叛的同时，进行民主改革。民主改革，是西藏社会发展史上一场最深刻的革命。这场革命，废除了封建农奴制度，使西藏各族人民翻身得解放，走上了社会主义的康庄大道，为西藏的繁荣进步开拓了广阔的前景。
    民主改革30年来，西藏发生了翻天覆地的变化。尽管西藏与全国兄弟省区比较，目前还比较落后、比较贫困，前进中也还有许多亟待解决的问题和困难，但是，西藏30年来在各个方面所取得的伟大成就，已举世瞩目，是过去任何一个历史时期都无法比拟的。
    藏族人民当家作主，民族区域自治制度不断完善。民主改革后，全区建立了各级基层政权组织。过去受压迫、受奴役的广大人民群众成了新社会的主人。1965年，西藏自治区正式成立，使我国宪法所赋予少数民族的民族区域自治权利在西藏得以实现。《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》实施以来，民族区域自治制度进一步完善。我区先后制定了一些地方性法规，实行了一系列不同于国内其他省区的特殊政策。民族语言文字的学习、使用得到重视。民族风俗习惯和宗教信仰受到尊重。一支以藏族为主体的民族干部职工队伍已经形成，一大批民族干部走上了各级领导岗位。
    经济建设不断发展，人民生活逐步改善。民主改革废除了旧制度，实现了生产关系的变革，解放了社会生产力。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，实行改革开放，促进了经济的发展。1988年与1959年比较，农业总产值增长近4倍。现代工业从无到有，已建立了电力、采矿、建筑、建材、轻工、毛纺、印刷、食品等260多个工业企业。在国家的大力扶持下，西藏的交通运输、邮电、商业、外贸和旅游业也有了很大的发展。在经济发展的基础上，人民生活逐步得到改善。现在，全区大多数农牧民的温饱问题已基本解决。困难户群众的基本生活通过扶贫救济工作得到保障。1988年，农牧民人均收入达380元。
    教育、科技、文化、卫生等事业发展迅速，促进了民族和社会的进步。解放前，西藏仅有少数几所为贵族子弟办的学校，如今已有各类学校2500多所，在校学生17万多人。文化事业日趋繁荣。藏学的研究，传统文化遗产的抢救整理工作，均取得很大成绩。广播电视事业发展迅速，目前已建立起自治区、地、县三级混合覆盖的广播电视网。科技、新闻出版、卫生、体育等事业，也都得到不同程度的发展。
    西藏民主改革30年来所取得的一切成就，是中国共产党正确领导的结果，是祖国大家庭中各兄弟民族大力支援的结果，是西藏各族人民在社会主义道路上奋勇前进的结果。实践证明，没有中国共产党，就没有西藏各族人民的翻身解放；离开祖国大家庭，就没有民族的发展进步；不走社会主义道路，就没有西藏的光明前途。任何反对四项基本原则、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的行为，都是逆历史潮流而动、违背西藏人民根本利益的，也是注定要失败的。西藏独立不行，半独立不行，变相独立也不行。这是历史的回答，也是人民的心声。
    为了西藏社会经济稳定、协调、持续地发展，现在，自治区正在研究制定社会经济发展战略设想和长远的目标。西藏各族人民将继续在党中央、国务院的正确领导和亲切关怀下，坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”，团结奋斗，艰苦创业，描绘新的画图。
