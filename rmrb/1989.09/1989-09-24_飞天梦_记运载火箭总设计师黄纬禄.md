The dream of flying to the sky among the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, from Chang'e flying to the moon, the magpie bridge meeting, to 500 years ago when a brave man named Wan Hu rode a "forty-seven arrow flying arrow" into the sky, has been unending. But after thousands of years of pursuit, the dream remains a dream.

Huang Weilu, as a child, also had a dream of flying to the sky. It was only in New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, through the unyielding efforts of millions of people, that yesterday's dream gradually became a reality.

"To Build a 'Proud Rocket'"

"You asked me how I got involved with rockets and missiles?" This chief designer of multiple types of carrier rockets and one of the pioneers of modern rockets and missiles in China, Huang Weilu, spoke in a pure Anhui Wuhu accent with the reporter. Huang, 73 years old, has white hair, a broad forehead with deep wrinkles, a thin long face, a high nose bridge, and looks wise and kind. Although he is in his seventies, his thoughts are clear, and he speaks eloquently. "I almost died because of missiles, and I was also one of the first to see missiles. This is fate, I guess!" Huang recalled his youth. In 1940, he graduated with excellent results from the Electrical Engineering Department of the former Central University. In 1943, with the dream of "science saving the country," he traveled overseas to Britain, first working as an apprentice in a factory, and then studying for a master's degree at the University of London. In June 1944, the doomed Hitler brought out his "secret weapon"—the first missile used in actual warfare in human history—the V-1 flying bomb, attacking London. Later, he changed to the more advanced V-2 flying bomb, causing great damage to Britain. Huang Weilu's factory was hit by a flying bomb. He said, "I was half an hour late, so the Grim Reaper did not take me away." Later, he saw the disassembled V-2 flying bomb in a museum, which can be considered the forerunner of long-range missiles and space rockets. He thought as he observed, "China is the homeland of rockets. When will modern rockets 'return home'?"

In 1947, Huang Weilu returned to his homeland, which had suffered greatly from the Japanese invaders, with a sense of longing and a "dream of strengthening the country." However, he found no way to serve his country and was heartbroken. The Kuomintang was on the verge of defeat and even more corrupt. In May 1949, the People's Liberation Army advanced into Shanghai. Huang Weilu said, "I saw with my own eyes the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army sleeping on the streets, taking nothing. This was in stark contrast to the Kuomintang soldiers who extorted gold bars and harassed the people as they retreated. I did not know much about the Communist Party, but from the army led by the Party, I saw the true hope of China." It was in that year that he joined the revolutionary cause, serving as a researcher in the Electrical Engineering Research Institute of the East China Industrial Department and the Electronic Technology Research Institute of the Signal Corps.

In the mid-1950s, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with far-sighted vision, decided to develop cutting-edge technology. Premier Zhou Enlai personally presided over the formulation of the 12-year scientific and technological development plan, listing the development of rockets as a key national project. After the establishment of the first-generation rocket (missile) research institution of our country—the Fifth Research Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, Huang Weilu was transferred to the Fifth Academy. He was determined to revitalize national prestige and military might, and to devote all his efforts!

"At that time, there were not many experts, and everyone was studying and researching hard. During the day, they conducted experiments, and at night, the offices were still brightly lit. They studied foreign languages, looked up materials, and conducted arguments. The political workers mobilized them three times, but they still did not leave. I worked for more than ten hours a day, sometimes all night, I don't know why, but at that time, there was such a spirit."

When it came to Soviet aid, Huang gave due recognition. When it came to the betrayal of the Soviet leaders, tearing up contracts, and withdrawing experts, Huang humorously said, "I support Chairman Mao's view that we should award Khrushchev a one-ton heavy medal. Without his pressure and provocation, where would our 'proud rocket' be? Where would our atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb be?" At that time, our country was under heavy pressure, with natural disasters and man-made calamities at home. Everyone worked day and night, but they still could not fill their stomachs, and many people suffered from edema. However, the care of the Party and the support from all sides warmed the hearts of the scientific and technological personnel. They threw away their crutches, and three months after the Soviet experts left, our country successfully launched the first carrier rocket, opening the curtain for China to fly into space. In 1964, our country's self-developed first carrier rocket also successfully flew. The rocket finally 'returned home and settled down,' and the whole country was excited. Huang Weilu was the chief designer of the rocket control system, responsible for the design of the rocket's 'brain,' 'nervous system,' and 'thousand-mile eye,' contributing his youth and wisdom to the birth of the rocket 'infant.'

For the Second Nuclear Strike Force

When the topic turned to the underwater launch of rockets from submarines, and to our country's strategic missiles and strategic nuclear weapons, Huang could not help but recall the exciting moment in the autumn of 1982:

"Launch!" The milky white "giant dragon" leaped out of the launch tube with the force of a thunderbolt, piercing through the deep sea water, raising a sky-high water column, and rushing upward with a waterfall, dyeing the blue sea and sky with a brilliant orange flame. The long trail of smoke marked the realization of the dream of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor to fly to the sky...

China was the fourth country to independently develop and the fifth to equip itself with this new type of carrier rocket. Billions of people cheered. The world was shocked again. Western public opinion believed that "China's submarine-launched missile will give China the ability to launch a second strike after suffering a nuclear attack," "This is something that any potential attacker must consider."

In September 1988, our country's nuclear submarine successfully launched a carrier rocket underwater, shocking the world again.

"Huang, as the chief designer of the new type of carrier rocket, what work have you done?" the reporter asked.

"I know only a little, and my role is limited. Because this is a large-scale engineering project, integrating the best of China's scientific and technological achievements. Just like other achievements in China's aerospace industry, without the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, without the close cooperation of thousands of scientific and technological units, factories, and troops, without the support of more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country, and without the hard work of the vast number of aerospace workers, no one could have succeeded." Speaking of this, Huang smiled slightly: "You shouldn't think I'm being modest, and you shouldn't think this is just a cliché. Isn't news about reality? This is a fact without any watering down!" Huang spoke both simply and appropriately.

As early as 1959, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The nuclear submarine must be developed, even if it takes ten thousand years." Premier Zhou made detailed arrangements for this. In March 1967, according to Premier Zhou's instructions, the research and development task of the new type of carrier rocket and missile for the nuclear submarine was officially determined. Huang Weilu was appointed as the director of the general design department and later as the deputy director and chief designer. This new type of carrier rocket and missile had no blueprints or technical data from others. Everything had to be researched independently, starting from scratch. Foreign countries spent huge amounts of money to develop this type of missile, with long cycles, which did not suit China's national conditions. We could only take the path of less investment, small batches, fewer and more precise launch tests, and high efficiency. We even had to turn the three steps others took into two steps or one step. This put higher demands on the strictness, practicality, and scientific nature of design, manufacturing, and testing. It can be imagined how heavy the burden on the shoulders of the chief designer!

How did Huang take on this burden?

Listen to what people say:

"When a scheme is more advanced and perfect than his original scheme, Huang will resolutely accept the new scheme and will not consider personal face. Huang said, we should seek big face, not small face; we should seek the face of the Party and the country, not the face of individuals or small groups."

"Huang's serious scientific attitude and meticulous work style are moving."

Once, during the test of a carrier rocket, a relay occasionally failed to engage. After repeated tests, it did not appear again. "This is just a coincidence, right!" someone suggested letting it pass. Huang said, "No!" He continued to test and observe with everyone, and finally found a small piece of iron filings on the relay armature. When the small iron filings stood up, the armature could not be in position, and the relay would not engage. Huang said:

"We must not underestimate this piece of iron filings. If the iron filings suddenly stand up during the rocket's flight, it will cause the entire flight to fail, causing the country to suffer millions or tens of millions of dollars in losses!" Huang reminded everyone that in scientific and technological work, we must firmly grasp the "four quality controls" of people's thoughts, fault handling, summarizing experience, and quality decision-making in product research, design, testing, inspection, production, and maintenance.

It was the critical moment of the flight test of the new type of carrier rocket, and suddenly it started to rain. The next morning, around eight or nine o'clock, it was a good "window" for launch. "1 hour preparation," "30 minutes preparation"... everyone was in position. At the crucial moment, a voltmeter suddenly moved slightly, and then moved again.

The control room was in shock.

Huang received the report, with only two minutes left, he calmly asked, "Is there a problem with the platform?" "No problem." "Launch on time!" In an instant, the rocket roared out, shaking the earth and mountains, carrying golden clouds, straight into the blue sky. "Success!" People cheered and hugged, the base commander tightly shook Huang's hand, respectful and grateful. Later, someone quietly asked:

"Old chief, how could you make the decision?" He said, "I am more familiar with the actual situation, familiar with the quality, performance, and working status of each part of the rocket. The platform itself has no problem, so I determined that it was an external influence. Because the control system is sensitive, even a slight wind or vibration will have a reaction." "Did you think about taking responsibility if it failed?" "At the moment of decision, I only considered whether to launch or not, whether it could be launched? I never thought about the individual." Huang smiled and added, "At the critical moment, there is no time to think about the individual!"

The Morality of a Communist

Huang said, "I joined the Party in 1960. I never thought that I, a person from a landlord family and an intellectual from the old society, could join the Party. On the day of the branch meeting, many experts participated, and I felt very honored. When I was notified of my approval to join the Party, I was recuperating in Lushan, and I was truly joyful. I decided to devote my life to the Party's cause. Now, they say 'my Chinese heart,' right? The Chinese heart is connected with the Party's heart. I understand that it is the same as the Party's sense of duty."

Huang's pursuit of his career can be summed up in two words: "obsessed." During the ten years of turmoil, Huang was also "sidelined," and the hats of "bourgeois reactionary academic authority" and "theory of productivity only" flew around. But he still often leaned over the table to draw blueprints or carried a yellow cloth bag, traveling between the engineering area, workshops, laboratories, and test bases.

One of his old secretaries gave the reporter a document, which had Huang's activity schedule for the second half of 1983. The schedule showed that from early August, Huang, who was nearly 70 years old and often ill, traveled to six provinces in less than five months, which was hard to believe. When the reporter talked to him, he had just returned from Xinjiang (traveled for more than 40 days) and said he would leave again the next day. Overwork made Huang overworked and sick, working "with illness." His wife was hospitalized for surgery, but he did not say a word and accepted the task to go to Inner Mongolia. People said, "The rocket is Huang's life." For the rocket to take off, he completely forgot himself and his family.

The reporter once visited Huang's home. The old-style four-bedroom apartment had a square table, an old-style double sofa, a few chairs, a refrigerator, and a small color TV on the combination cabinet. There was no carpet, no floor leather. "This is a humble dwelling, but my virtue is fragrant." Huang indeed lived in a "humble dwelling" but had a "fragrant virtue."

Huang had a dedicated car, but his children had never ridden in it. When his wife was hospitalized, the secretary arranged for a car to take her, but when he returned from a trip, he insisted that the secretary go to pay for the gasoline. Huang's several secretaries talked about him, all saying, "The old man is very good to 'serve,'" going on a trip, he would say, "It's up to you," and would not stay in high-class accommodations. Once in Guangdong, he stayed in a hotel for 17 yuan per night, and he thought it was expensive and insisted on moving out; he ate in small restaurants, and steamed buns and noodles were enough. He often went down to eat with everyone, eating pickled vegetables and steamed buns.

But Huang cared for his comrades, friends, and even comrades in difficult circumstances, with meticulous attention. A comrade donated blood, and he insisted on climbing 16 floors to visit this comrade's home; after returning from a trip, he did not go home first but went to the office to see everyone; during the Spring Festival, he would find time to visit the homes of comrades around him. A comrade in the 1950s received heavy punishment, and he supported grain tickets and money, and repeatedly found leaders and organizations to help this comrade find a proper place.

Einstein, in his eulogy for Madame Curie, said, "A person's significance to the times and the course of history may be more important in their moral character than in their pure intellectual achievements." Huang highly appreciated this sentence and took it as his motto. But his own moral character, can it not be considered a model for Communists today? In a sense, this is in no way inferior to his contributions to the country, the people, and the Party in the exploration of space technology!

Huang Weilu, the people respect you!

    飞天梦
    ——记运载火箭总设计师黄纬禄
    本报记者　高新庆
    炎黄子孙飞天梦，从嫦娥奔月、鹊桥相会……到500年前一位名叫万虎的勇士驾驶“四十七矢飞廉箭”升空，绵绵不绝。但千古求索，梦依旧是梦。
    黄纬禄，小时候也做过飞天梦。只是在新中国，在共产党领导下，经过千百万人百折不挠的努力，昨天的梦，才逐步变为现实。
            要造出“争气火箭”
    “你问我怎么跟火箭、导弹结缘的？”“战争！”这位多种型号运载火箭总设计师，中国现代火箭、导弹元勋之一的黄纬禄，操着道地的安徽芜湖口音，同记者侃侃交谈。黄总73岁，花白头发，宽宽的前额爬满皱纹，瘦削的长脸，高高的鼻梁，慈祥而睿智，虽古稀之年，但思路清晰，妙语连珠。“我差一点死于导弹，也是最早见识导弹，这也是缘份吧！”黄总思绪转到青年时代。1940年，他以优异成绩毕业于原中央大学电机系。1943年，抱着“科学救国”的幻想，远涉重洋赴英国，先是在一家工厂实习做工，然后又到英国伦敦大学攻读硕士学位。1944年6月，濒临灭亡的希特勒，搬出他的“秘密”武器——人类战争史上第一次实战用的导弹——V—1飞弹，袭击英国伦敦，以后又改成更先进的V—2飞弹猛袭，给英国造成很大破坏。黄纬禄所在工厂遭一枚飞弹袭击，他说：“我晚到了半小时，死神才没有把我带走。”以后，他又在博物馆看到了分解的V—2飞弹实物，这可以称为远程导弹和宇宙火箭的先驱。他边参观边想，中国是火箭的故乡，哪一天现代火箭能“回娘家”呢？
    1947年，黄纬禄怀着眷恋之情和“强国梦”，回到了饱经日寇蹂躏之苦的祖国。可他报国无门，痛心疾首。国民党临近败亡，更加腐败。1949年5月，解放军挺进上海。黄纬禄说：“我亲眼看到解放军官兵露宿街头，秋毫无犯，这与国民党军队临败退时勒索金条、扰民害民形成鲜明对照。本来我对共产党缺乏了解，但从党领导的军队身上，我看到中国真正的希望。”就在那一年，他参加革命工作，先后在华东工业部电工研究所和通信兵部电子技术研究所任研究员。
    50年代中期，党中央、毛主席高瞻远瞩，提出要下决心搞尖端技术。周恩来总理亲自主持制定的12年科学技术发展规划，把发展火箭列为国家重点项目。我国第一代火箭（导弹）研究机构——国防部第五研究院成立后，黄纬禄调入五院，他下决心要为振国威军威，殚精竭虑！
    “那时，内行不多，大家都拚命学习、钻研。白天搞实验，深夜一个个办公室仍是灯火通明，学外文，查资料，搞论证，政工干部三番五次动员，还不走。我每天工作十几小时，有时通宵达旦，不知为什么，那时就有那么一股劲。”
    谈到苏联援助，黄总给以应有的肯定。谈到苏联领导人背信弃义、撕毁合同、撤退专家时，黄总诙谐地说：“我拥护毛主席的观点，应该给赫鲁晓夫发一个一吨重的大勋章。没有他这一逼、一激，哪有我们的‘争气火箭’？哪有我们的原子弹、氢弹？”那时我国压力重重，国内天灾人祸，大家夜以继日地工作，还吃不饱肚子，不少人得了浮肿病。然而，党的关怀，各方的支援，温暖了科技人员的心。他们丢掉拐棍，苏联专家撤走3个月后我国就成功地发射了第一枚运载火箭，揭开了中国飞向太空的序幕。1964年，我国自行研制的第一枚运载火箭也飞行试验成功。火箭终于“回娘家落户了”，全国为之振奋。黄纬禄是火箭控制系统主任设计师，负责火箭“大脑”、“神经系统”、“千里眼”等的设计，为火箭“初生儿”的诞生，贡献了自己的青春和才智。
      为了第二次核打击力量
    当话题转到潜艇水下发射火箭，转到我国战略导弹、战略核武器时，黄总情不自禁地回到1982年金秋的那个激动人心的时刻：
      “发射！”乳白色的“巨龙”，以雷霆万钧之势跃出发射筒，穿越深深的海水，带起冲天水柱，身披瀑布向上疾速飞腾，桔红色火焰，把碧海、蓝天染得上下辉煌。长长的烟云轨迹，标志着炎黄子孙飞天梦变成现实……
    中国是第四个自行研制、第五个装备这种新型运载火箭的国家。亿万人民欢呼雀跃。全世界再一次震惊。西方舆论认为，“中国制成潜艇发射的导弹将使中国拥有受到一次核攻击后进行第二次反击的能力”，“这是任何潜在的袭击者都必须加以考虑的。”
    1988年9月，我国核潜艇水下发射运载火箭获圆满成功，全世界又为之一惊。
      “黄总，作为新型运载火箭总设计师，您做了哪些工作？”记者问道。
      “我懂得的东西有限，发挥的作用也有限。因为这是一个大的系统工程，集我国科学技术之大成。同我国航天事业所取得的其他成就一样，离开党中央、国务院的正确领导，离开成千上万个科技单位、工厂、部队的密切合作，离开全国十几个省市的支援和广大航天职工艰苦奋斗，谁也没有本事搞成功。”谈到这里，黄总微微一笑：“你不要以为我是谦虚，也不要认为这是套话，新闻不是讲真实吗？这是不掺水份的事实呀！”黄总说得既朴实又得体。
    早在1959年毛主席就明确指出：“核潜艇一万年也要搞出来。”周总理为此作了周密部署。1967年3月，根据周总理的指示，为核潜艇配套的新型运载火箭和导弹研制任务正式定下来。黄纬禄为总体设计部主任，以后又被任命为副院长兼总设计师。这种新型运载火箭和导弹，没有别人的蓝图，没有别人的技术资料，一切都得自己研究，白手起家。国外为发展此类导弹，耗资巨大，周期长，不符合我国国情。我们只能走投资少、批量小、弹射试验少而精、效率高的路子，甚至要把人家走过的三步变成两步、一步。这对设计、制造、试验的严密性、实用性、科学性提出了更高的要求。可以想象，作为总设计师，肩上的担子有多沉重！
    黄总怎样挑起这副担子？
    听听人们的议论：
      “当一种方案比自己原来方案更先进、更完善时，黄总会毅然接受新方案，决不考虑个人的面子。黄总说，我们要争大面子，不要争小面子；要争党和国家的面子，不要争个人或小集团的面子。”
      “黄总严肃的科学态度和严谨的工作作风，令人感动。”
    有一次，一枚运载火箭测试时，有一个继电器偶尔出现一次该吸合而未吸合的现象，后反复测试，未再出现。“这是偶然现象吧！”有人主张放过去。黄总说：“不行！”他与大家一起继续测试、观察，结果发现继电器衔铁上有一片微小的铁屑，当小铁屑竖起时，衔铁不能到位，继电器就不吸合。黄总说：
  “可不能小看这个铁屑，火箭飞行中铁屑忽然竖起来，就会招致整个飞行失败，给国家带来几百万、上千万的损失呀！”黄总告诫大家，搞科学技术必须在产品研究、设计、测试、检验、出厂、使用维护等各个环节上，坚决抓好人的思想、故障处理、总结经验、质量决策这“四个质量关”。
    那是新型运载火箭飞行试验的关键时刻，突然下起雨来。第二天早晨八九点，是一个发射的好
  “窗口”。“1小时准备”，“30分钟准备”……各就各位，节骨眼上，突然一个电压表微微摆动了一下，接着又摆动了一下。
    发控室内，人们惊呆了。
    黄总接到报告，只剩两分钟，他冷静地问：“平台有没有问题？”“没问题。”“按时发射！”顷刻间，火箭轰鸣而出，地动山摇，带着金色的云烟，直插蓝天。“成功了！”人们欢呼、拥抱，基地司令紧紧握着黄总的手，敬佩、感激。事后有人悄悄地问：
  “老总，您咋敢拍板？”他说：“我比较了解实际，熟悉火箭各部分的质量、性能、工作状态。平台本身没问题，我就断定是外界影响，因控制系统灵敏度高，微风或微震都会有反应。”“你有没有想到，万一失败了要负责任？”“决断时刻，我只考虑打不打、能不能打？从没想到个人。”黄总笑笑又补充说：“千钧一发时刻，也顾不得想个人啊！”
          共产党人的情操
    黄总说：“我是1960年入党的。原来没想到我这个地主家庭出身、旧社会过来的知识分子能够入党。支部大会表决那天，许多专家都参加了，我感到很光荣。通知批准我入党时，我在庐山疗养，真喜悦啊，我就决心为党的事业奋斗终身。现在不是说
  ‘我的中国心’吗？中国心是与党心相通的，我理解也就是党的事业心。”
    黄总对事业的追求，可以用两个字概括：“入迷”。10年动乱，黄总也“靠边”了，“资产阶级反动学术权威”、“唯生产力论”的帽子满天飞。可他还是经常趴在桌上绘图纸，或者挎着黄布背包，奔波于工程区、车间、试验室和试验基地之间。
    他的一位老秘书给了记者一份材料，上面有黄总1983年下半年活动的时间表。时间表表明从8月初黄总出院，不到5个月，这位年近70岁、又多病的老人出差6个省，实在叫人难以置信。记者与他讲话时，他前一天刚从新疆回来（出差40多天），还说隔天又要走。过度劳累，使黄总积劳成疾，长年“带病运转”。他夫人住院开刀，他不吭气，照样接受任务去内蒙古。人们说：“火箭就是黄总的生命。”为了火箭升空，他完全到了忘我、忘家的境地。
    记者曾访过黄总家。老式的四室一厅，客厅里有一张四方桌，一张旧式双人沙发，几把椅子，一台电冰箱，组合柜上有一部不大的彩电。没有地毯，没有地板革。“斯是陋室，惟吾德馨。”黄总的确是居“陋室”而“德馨”。
    黄总有一部专车，子女从没坐过。老伴住院，秘书安排车送了一下，出差回来，硬是让秘书去补交汽油费。黄总几个秘书谈到他，都说“老头特好‘侍候’”，出差就说：‘交给你了’，住房不让住高档。一次去广东，住一宾馆17元一晚，他嫌贵，硬要搬走；吃饭下小饭馆，包子、面条对付就行。他常到下面与大家一起吃咸菜啃窝窝头。”
    可黄总对同志、朋友，包括身处逆境的同志，却体贴关心，无微不至。一位同志献血，他硬是爬16层楼，到这位同志家看看；出差回来，不是先回家，而是先到办公室，看看大家；过年过节，必抽时间到周围同志家串串门。一位老同志，50年代受处分过重，他又是支援粮票又是支援钱，几次三番找领导找组织，使这位同志得到妥善安置。
    爱因斯坦在悼念居里夫人时说过：“一个人对于时代和历史进程的意义，在其道德品质方面，也许比单纯的才智成就方面更为重要。”黄总非常欣赏这句话，把它当作座右铭。而他本人的道德品质，在今天，难道不可以算是共产党人的楷模吗？从某种意义上说，这一点也不逊于他在空间技术探索方面对祖国、对人民、对党的贡献！
      黄纬禄，人民敬重您！
