Column: International Notes

    Just as the Vietnamese authorities solemnly declared that they would "completely" withdraw from Cambodia by September 27 and specially invited foreign observers and journalists to witness it, news recently emerged that Vietnam has increased its troops in Cambodia by 7,000, leaving people baffled.

    In early September, this batch of Vietnamese soldiers either took ships or cars to reach Cambodia. To avoid detection, some Vietnamese soldiers changed into the uniforms of the Phnom Penh puppet army and then dispersed to various locations. In fact, before this, Vietnam had already made many invading Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia wear the uniforms of the Phnom Penh puppet army or disguise themselves as "local people." Once needed, these disguised Vietnamese could be put to use.

    Vietnam's simultaneous announcement of withdrawal and massive troop increase can only indicate its lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Cambodia issue, which has drawn global attention. In the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia, Vietnam persistently opposed the United Nations' supervision of its withdrawal from Cambodia. The reason is clear. Vietnam's troop increase in Cambodia provides the explanation. The Vietnamese authorities' ultimate plan is to find every possible way to continue controlling Cambodia. Understanding this, all the seemingly contradictory actions of the Hanoi authorities become understandable.

    As early as July and August, when preparing for and holding the Paris International Conference, Vietnam, in collusion with the Phnom Penh puppet army, launched a large-scale attack on the anti-Vietnamese armed forces in the Battambang province of Cambodia, attempting to use military force to gain more bargaining chips in diplomacy. However, this attempt failed. This time, increasing troops again will not produce any miracles. The Vietnamese authorities should understand: facing the Cambodian people who are determined to carry out the anti-Vietnamese struggle to the end, whether it is playing political tricks or brandishing weapons, all are doomed to fail.

    意欲何为
    就在越南当局信誓旦旦地宣布9月27日之前从柬埔寨“全部”撤军，并特意邀请外国观察家和新闻记者前往观看之后，近日又传来了越南向柬埔寨增兵7000的消息，令人百思不解。
    9月初，这批越南士兵或坐轮船，或乘汽车抵达柬埔寨。为了掩人耳目，一部分越南士兵换上了金边伪军的制服，然后分赴各地。其实，在此之前，越南已让不少侵柬越军换上了金边伪军的制服，或伪装成柬埔寨的“老百姓”了。一旦需要，这些伪装了的越南人便可以派上用场。
    越南一面宣布撤军，一面又大举增兵，只能说明它对和平解决世人关注的柬埔寨问题缺乏诚意。在不久前举行的柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议上，越南一个劲地反对联合国主持国际监督机构对它从柬撤军进行有效监督。原因何在？越南向柬增兵一举提供了注脚。想方设法继续控制柬埔寨，这是越南当局骨子里的打算。明白了这一层，对河内当局一切看起来颠三倒四的言行，也就见怪不怪了。
    早在7、8月间筹备和召开巴黎国际会议时，越南纠合金边伪军在柬埔寨马德望省向抗越武装力量发动大规模进攻，妄图用枪炮增加一点外交上讨价还价的筹码，结果遭到失败。此次再次增兵，也不会产生什么奇迹。越南当局应当明白：面对决心把抗越救国斗争进行到底的柬埔寨人民，不论是耍政治阴谋，或是舞枪弄刀，都是注定要失败的。
