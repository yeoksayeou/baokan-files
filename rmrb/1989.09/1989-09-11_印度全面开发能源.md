In recent years, the Indian government has taken various measures to tap into potential resources and actively develop energy to meet the growing demand for energy.

Coal is India's primary energy source, with proven reserves of 500 billion tons. It is the main fuel for power generation and steelmaking, accounting for over 40% of the country's commercial energy consumption. The Indian government has adopted measures such as increasing investment, attracting foreign capital, adopting advanced technology, strengthening scientific research, and improving management to further develop and utilize coal resources. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period (1986-1990), the government invested 67 billion rupees (approximately 13 rupees per dollar at the time) in bituminous coal mining and 15 billion rupees in lignite mining. Additionally, it borrowed $600 million from the World Bank to develop the coal industry.

To mechanize coal mining and transportation, India has successively introduced advanced technologies from countries such as the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Canada. Research funding increased from 4.2 billion rupees during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" to 25 billion rupees during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Coal production in the 1987-1988 fiscal year was 1.79 billion tons, and it is projected to reach 2.26 billion tons by 1990, with a target of 4 billion tons annually by the year 2000.

To meet domestic oil consumption and reduce imports, India is accelerating the development of oil resources. In the 1988-1989 fiscal year, $1.8 billion was allocated for oil production research and development.

Currently, crude oil production has reached over 30 million tons, which is three times the amount produced a decade ago. The proportion of imported oil has decreased from 70% in 1981 to 35% in 1988. The plan is to achieve 1.44 billion tons of oil production during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

India's natural gas production has also seen significant growth in recent years, increasing from 1.4 billion cubic meters in the 1970-1971 fiscal year to 9.8 billion cubic meters in the 1986-1987 fiscal year. It is estimated that production will reach 14.9 billion cubic meters in the 1989-1990 fiscal year.

Utilizing nuclear power for electricity generation is one of India's important strategic measures to address power shortages. India's first nuclear power plant was commissioned in 1969. Last year, the government approved a plan to build 12 nuclear power plants with a total installed capacity of 6 million kilowatts. Including previously constructed nuclear power plants, India's nuclear power capacity will reach approximately 10 million kilowatts.

India places great importance on the development and utilization of solar energy, allocating 1.2 billion rupees for research and experiments in this area. Currently, solar energy technology is widely used in cooking, heating water, heating, and communication in remote areas.

The Indian government has adopted a subsidy policy to sell 100,000 solar cookers, making solar cookers a commonly used heating device. Currently, 100,000 villages use solar energy as the main means to solve energy problems.

India also plans to build several solar power stations in remote areas such as Ladakh and Punjab.

India has installed 1,700 wind-powered water pumps nationwide. Some farms' wind turbines have been connected to the local power grid. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, 200 wind power stations have been established, mainly for agricultural irrigation. Indian scientists are designing large wind turbines for different regions. It is estimated that coastal areas alone can generate 20,000 kilowatts of wind power.

In summary, India's multi-channel energy development measures have achieved initial results, which will further promote economic construction and development.

    印度全面开发能源
　　归通昌
    近年来，印度政府采取各种措施，挖掘潜力，积极开发能源，以解决对能源日益增长的需求。
    煤炭是印度的第一能源，已探明储量有5000亿吨，是发电和炼钢的主要燃料，占全国商品能源消费的40％以上。印度政府通过增加投资、引进外资、采用先进技术、加强科学研究、改进经营管理等措施，进一步开发和利用煤炭资源。仅“七五”计划期间（1986—1990），政府对烟煤开采投资670亿卢比（当时比价1美元约合13卢比），为褐煤开采投资150亿卢比，还从世界银行贷款6亿美元用于发展煤炭工业。
    为了对采煤和运输实行机械化，印度先后从英国、法国、联邦德国、波兰、苏联和加拿大等国引进先进技术。投入科研的经费由“六五”期间的4.2亿卢比增加到“七五”期间的25亿卢比。煤产量1987—1988年度为1.79亿吨，预计到1990年将达到2.26亿吨，争取到2000年年产量达到4亿吨。
    为满足国内对石油的消费和减少进口，印度正加紧开发石油资源。1988—1989年度，拨出18亿美元用于石油生产的研究和开发工作。
    目前，原油产量已达3000多万吨，相当于10年前的3倍。进口石油所占的比重已从1981年的70％下降到1988年的35％，计划“七五”期间石油产量达到1.44亿吨。
    印度的天然气产量这几年也有较大增长，从1970—1971年度的14亿立方米增长到1986—1987年度的98亿立方米，预计1989—1990年度产量可达到149亿立方米。
    利用原子能发电，是印度解决电力不足的重要战略措施之一。印度第一座原子能发电站于1969年投入使用。前年，政府批准了建造12座核电站的计划，总装机容量为600万千瓦。加上以前建造的核电站，印度核电将拥有约1000万千瓦的装机容量。
    印度十分重视对太阳能的开发利用，用于该项目的研究和试验的资金达1.2亿卢比。目前，太阳能技术已被广泛应用于烹调、热水、供暖和边远地区的通讯等。
    印度政府采取补贴销售的办法出售了10万个太阳能灶具，太阳能灶已成了普遍使用的加热装置。目前，已有10万个村庄利用太阳能作为解决能源问题的主要手段。
    印度还计划在偏僻的拉达克地区和旁遮普邦建立一些太阳能电站。
    印度全国已安装了1700个汲水用风车。有的农场的风力发电机已并入当地电力网。在南部的安得拉邦已建立200个风力发电站，主要用于农田灌溉。印度科学家正在设计供不同地区使用的大型风力发电机。据估计，仅沿海地区就可以利用风能发电2万千瓦。
    总之，印度采取多渠道开发能源的措施，已取得初步成果，这将进一步促进经济建设的发展。
