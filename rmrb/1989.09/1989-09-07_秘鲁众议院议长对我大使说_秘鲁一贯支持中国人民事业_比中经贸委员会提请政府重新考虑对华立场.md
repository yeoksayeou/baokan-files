Xinhua News Agency, Lima, September 5th.

The President of the Peruvian Congress, Fernando León, said on September 5th that Peru has always sympathized with and supported the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, and hopes to continue developing the traditional friendship between the peoples and parliaments of Peru and China.

León made these remarks when receiving the Chinese Ambassador to Peru, Zhu Xiangzhong. During the meeting, Ambassador Zhu provided a detailed account of the truth behind the Beijing incident, the current situation in China, and its domestic and foreign policies.

León said that when a few Western countries took advantage of the recent events in China to stir up an anti-China wave and attempt to subvert the legitimate Chinese government, the Peruvian people were deeply concerned. He said, "Now, we are pleased to see that the Chinese government has restored its authority and sovereignty." He added, "For China, the worst times have passed."

The Congress President also said, "We understand China's true liberation process because Peru and China have common goals."

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, September 7th. Reporter Wei Wei reports:

This noon, the reporter received a news release from the Belgium-China Economic and Trade Committee. The release pointed out that since the suppression of the Beijing riot in early June, "trade between Belgium and China has been normal, and within the scope of formally signed contracts, there have been no difficulties in supply, transportation, and payment."

The release said, considering that Japan, China's second-largest trading partner, and the United States, the third-largest partner, have recently resumed normal trade relations with China, it is suggested that the Belgian authorities "reconsider the stance adopted at the Madrid meeting of the European Community in June." The release recalled that in developing trade and cooperation with China, the Belgian government had made significant achievements, and therefore the Belgium-China Economic and Trade Committee believed that "it would be beneficial to reconsider this issue as soon as possible."

Recently, Maurice, the Director of Business Development and External Relations at the Belgian Telephone Company, said in an interview with our reporter, "The Chinese market is attractive, and the future of the Sino-Belgian joint venture Shanghai Bell Telephone Company is bright."

Maurice told the reporter that the Chinese market is attractive because "since China implemented reform and opening up, it has developed rapidly, and its economic structure is changing; China's demand is large, and the market is vast; laws and regulations are being improved, and the economic environment is constantly improving."

When discussing the issues of inflation and corruption that have emerged in China in recent years, Maurice said, "The West also has similar situations. Democracy is a right that everyone should enjoy, but democracy should not paralyze social life. The ten billion people in China should all respect the law; otherwise, the entire country will lose control."

    秘鲁众议院议长对我大使说
    秘鲁一贯支持中国人民事业
    比中经贸委员会提请政府重新考虑对华立场
    新华社利马9月5日电  秘鲁众议院议长费尔南多·莱昂5日说，秘鲁一贯同情和支持中国人民的革命事业，希望继续发展秘中两国人民和议会间的传统友谊。
    莱昂议长是在中国驻秘鲁大使朱祥忠去拜会他的时候说这番话的。会晤时，朱大使详细介绍了北京平暴真相、中国当前形势及对内对外政策。
    莱昂议长说，当少数西方国家利用中国最近发生的事态掀起反华浪潮并企图颠覆中国合法政府时，秘鲁人民深感担忧。他说，“现在，我们满意地看到中国政府已经恢复了它的权威和主权”。他还说，“对中国来讲，最坏的时刻已经过去”。
    这位议长还说，“我们理解中国真正的解放进程，因为，秘鲁和中国有共同的目标”。
    本报布鲁塞尔9月7日电记者魏崴报道：今天中午，记者收到比利时—中国经济贸易委员会寄来的新闻公报。公报指出，自6月初北京平息暴乱以来，“比中贸易往来正常，在双方正式签署合同的范围内，供货运输及支付方面，彼此均无困难”。
    公报说，鉴于在贸易上仅次于香港的中国第二大贸易伙伴日本、第三大伙伴美国均在不久前和中国在外贸关系上恢复了正常往来，故提请比利时当局注意，“对6月间欧共体马德里会议确定的立场，予以重新考虑”。公报追忆道，在发展同中国的贸易和合作上，比利时政府曾广有建树，因而比中经贸委员会认为，“尽快重新考虑这一问题是有益的”。
    据新华社布鲁塞尔9月5日电　（记者杨元华），比利时贝尔电话公司业务发展和对外关系部主任茅雷尔最近在此间接受本社记者采访时说：“中国市场有吸引力，中国和比利时合营的上海贝尔电话公司发展前景光明。”
    茅雷尔对记者说，中国市场之所以有吸引力是因为，“中国实行改革开放以来发展很快，经济结构正在发生变化；中国的需求很大，市场广阔；法律制度正在完善，经济环境也在不断改善。”
    在谈到中国近几年出现的通货膨胀和贪污腐败等问题时，茅雷尔说，“西方也有类似的情况。民主是人人应该享受的权利，但是民主不应使社会生活瘫痪。中国十亿人都应当尊重法律，否则整个国家就会失去控制”。
