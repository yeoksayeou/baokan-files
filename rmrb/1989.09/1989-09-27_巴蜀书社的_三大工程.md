The Sichuan Book Company, though only "five years" old, has already published over 200 books, with a total print run of over 2 million copies. These books, published under the guideline of "ancient for modern use, pushing the old to create the new," have garnered praise from readers both at home and abroad. Among them, the "three major projects" of the company, namely the *Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books*, *Selected Daoist Canon*, and *Complete Prose of the Song Dynasty*, are particularly notable.

The Sichuan Book Company has reprinted the *Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books*, originally published by the Commercial Press half a century ago, and has compiled a detailed index. The complete set of 82 volumes has just been published. The *Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books* is the largest extant comprehensive encyclopedia in China, containing approximately 160 million characters, second only to the *Yongle Encyclopedia* of the Ming Dynasty. It includes works from the pre-Qin period to the late Ming and early Qing, covering various aspects of natural sciences and social sciences, truly encompassing everything under heaven and earth. Its structure is well-organized, making it easy to search. Dr. Joseph Needham owns a set of the old edition of the *Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books*, which served as a major source for his magnum opus, *Science and Civilisation in China*. Dr. Needham remarked that the *Collection* has been of great use to him throughout his life.

The *Selected Daoist Canon* is a massive collection of Daoist texts. The Sichuan Book Company has reprinted the only surviving edition in the world—the *Selected Daoist Canon* stored in the Qingyang Temple in Chengdu—using the original Qing Dynasty woodblocks. The *Selected Daoist Canon* consists of 28 volumes, containing 292 works, and provides a relatively complete collection of important Daoist classics. It is a valuable resource for the study of Chinese philosophy, religion, history, literature, and science and technology. The Qing Dynasty edition also showcases the exquisite craftsmanship of Sichuan woodblock printing. This edition, published by the Sichuan Book Company, is hand-printed on traditional Chinese paper in a 16-page format, bound in traditional style, and comes in a total of 246 volumes, each with a numbered cover.

The newly compiled *Complete Prose of the Song Dynasty* is the largest ancient book compilation project since the founding of the People's Republic and the largest comprehensive collection of a single dynasty. It gathers all the prose, parallel prose, and non-verse poetry from the Song Dynasty, totaling over 100,000 pieces and approximately 60 million characters. This set, compiled by the Institute of Ancient Books at Sichuan University and published by the Sichuan Book Company, has already released 4 volumes. The complete set will consist of about 100 volumes and is expected to be completed in five years.

    巴蜀书社的“三大工程”
    袁晞
    巴蜀书社年仅“五岁”，却已出书200余种，印行200余万册，这些按“古为今用，推陈出新”方针出版的古籍颇得海内外读者赞誉，其中以书社称之“三大工程”的《古今图书集成》、《道藏辑要》和
  《全宋文》为最。
    巴蜀书社影印出版了中华书局半个世纪前影印的《古今图书集成》，并新编详明索引，全书82册刚刚出齐。《古今图书集成》是我国今存最大的一部综合性类书，全书共约1亿6千万字，仅次于明《永乐大典》。所收典籍上起先秦、下迄明末清初，内容含自然科学和社会科学的各个方面，真可谓“包罗万象，囊括天地”，而且体例得当，经纬交织，易于查找。李约瑟博士收有一套旧版《古今图书集成》，作为他的大作《中国科学技术史》的主要资料来源，李约瑟博士说，《集成》他一生受用。
      《道藏辑要》是中国的巨型道教丛书，巴蜀书社根据当今世界道教典籍的唯一存版——成都青羊宫藏《道藏辑要》清光绪刻板重印出版。
  《道藏辑要》全书28集，共收著作292种，比较完整的收集了道教的重要经典，是研究我国哲学、宗教、历史、文艺和科学技术的重要资料。清刻本还显示了精美的蜀刻工艺。巴蜀书社此次出版全由老工匠手工刷印，16开宣纸线装本，共246册，加函套包装，编号发行。
    新编古籍《全宋文》是建国以来最大的古籍整理项目，也是中国最大的断代总集，汇集了宋朝320间所有的单篇散文、骈文和诗词以外的韵文共10万多篇，全书字数约6000万。这套由四川大学古籍整理研究所编纂、巴蜀书社出版的《全宋文》现已出书4册，全书共约百册，预计在五年内出齐。
