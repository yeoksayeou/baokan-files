Socialist Cause is Advancing

On December 20, 1987, near the Manwan section of the Lancang River in western Yunnan, nearly a hundred xenon lamps, searchlights, and iodine-tungsten lamps illuminated hundreds of dump trucks, which, at a rate of one truck every 30 seconds, continuously dumped thousands of tons of dumped stones into the river.

Before dawn, a loud explosion was heard, and a stone cage tower on the opposite bank of the river crashed down with an overwhelming force, instantly narrowing the river to just 5 meters wide. The hydroelectric construction workers pressed on, and at 6:10 AM, they successfully blocked the ancient flow of the Lancang River—

The Manwan Hydropower Station successfully diverted the river a year ahead of schedule!

The curtain for the comprehensive development of the Lancang River was raised!

The Lancang River originates from the Tanggula Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, flows through Tibet into Yunnan, and is a famous international river with a total length of 4,500 kilometers.

The construction of the Manwan Hydropower Station with an installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts is the first phase of the Lancang River development project.

Going upstream, snow-capped mountains resemble "solid reservoirs," melting into countless streams that converge to form the Lancang River's vast hydropower resources. In the 1,300-kilometer section of the river within Yunnan, 15 large-scale cascading hydropower stations can be built, with an installed capacity of over 13.7 million kilowatts, earning it the nickname "little sun." Among the numerous mountains, there are abundant mineral resources such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc, germanium, antimony, and salt. The world's largest Lanping lead-zinc mine is among them.

Going downstream, vast primeval forests stretch out, with tigers, elephants, and wild buffaloes roaming among them.

Since ancient times, the Lancang River has nurtured more than ten ethnic minorities living on both banks, including Tibetans, Lisu, Bai, Yi, Wa, Dai, and Lahu.

Here, songs are sung throughout the year. After the "Water Splashing Festival," it's time for the "March Street." After hearing the "wooden drum" sound, the "trumpet dance" begins... The diverse and colorful ethnic cultures form a vivid and unique landscape of the Lancang River.

Such a combination of natural beauty, resources, people, and culture is unique to the Lancang River and is truly extraordinary.

The comprehensive development of the Lancang River is the wish of the 35 million people of various ethnic groups in the border regions of Yunnan. It has urgent and practical significance for enhancing the economic vitality of western Yunnan, revitalizing the economy of Yunnan, supporting the economic development of the eastern coastal regions, and consolidating the border defense.

In early 1988, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government proposed the "electricity first, mineral and electricity combination, open to the outside world, comprehensive development" 16-character policy, determined to use about 20 years to first develop the hydropower of the Lancang River, and promote the comprehensive development of other resources in the basin.

Recently, the province has used part of the electricity generated by the Manwan Power Station to develop the rich phosphate resources around Dianchi Lake, building a phosphoric chemical base, taking the first step in the "mineral and electricity combination."

Now, people from China and abroad are flocking to the region, conducting surveys and discussions, sparking a wave of strategic planning for the development and construction of the Lancang River basin.

### 澜沧江，富饶的江

    澜沧江，富饶的江
    1987年12月20日，云南西部澜沧江中游河段的漫湾两岸，近百盏氙灯、探照灯、碘钨灯照射着上百辆自卸汽车，以每30秒一车的速度不停地把成千上万吨抛投石料倾倒入江中。
    拂晓前，忽听一声巨响，江对岸一座石笼塔以排山倒海之势按照人的意志跌下来，一下把江面缩短到5米，水电建设者乘胜前进，6点10分，终于拦腰斩断了千古奔流的澜沧江——
    漫湾水电站提前一年截流成功了！
    综合开发澜沧江的帷幕拉开了！
    澜沧江发源于青藏高原的唐古拉山，流经西藏进入云南，全长4500公里，是一条著名的国际河流。
    建设装机150万千瓦的漫湾水电站，是开发澜沧江的第一期工程。
    逆江而上，一座座雪山酷似“固体水库”，它融化为万千条细流汇成澜沧江巨大的水力资源，在云南境内的1300公里河段上就可建设15座大型梯级电站，装机1370余万千瓦，被人们誉为一个“小太阳”，在那众多的大山之中，蕴藏着金、银、铜、铁、锡、铅、锌、锗、锑、盐等丰富的矿产资源，世界上特大型的兰坪铅锌矿就在其中。
    顺江而下，原始森林莽莽苍苍，老虎、大象和野牛诸多珍禽异兽出没其间。
    自古以来，澜沧江哺育了两岸的藏族、傈僳族、白族、彝族、佤族、傣族、拉祜族等10多个少数民族。
    这里，一年四季歌不落。才过“泼水节”，又到“三月街”，听了“木鼓”声，又见“锅庄”起……多姿多彩的民族文化构成了一幅澜沧江浓郁而独特的风情画卷。
    如此天、地、人、物的风采神韵，集澜沧江一身，可谓神奇无比。
    综合开发澜沧江，是云南边疆3500万各族人民的心愿，对于增强滇西经济活力，振兴云南经济，支援东部沿海地区的经济发展，巩固边防，都具有紧迫而现实的意义。
    1988年初，云南省人民政府提出了“电力先行，矿电结合，对外开放，综合开发”的16字方针，决心用20年左右的时间先将澜沧江的水电开发出来，带动和促进流域内其它资源的综合开发。
    不久前，省里已用漫湾电站投产后的部分电力用于滇池周围丰富的磷矿资源开发，建设一个磷化工基地，走出了“矿电结合”的第一步。
    如今，中外人士纷至沓来，考察、论证，掀起了一股为开发和建设澜沧江流域而献计献策的热流。
