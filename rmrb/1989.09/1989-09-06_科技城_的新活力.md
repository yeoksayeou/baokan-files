Longcheng, often referred to as the "Automobile City" and praised as the "Forest City," is also a city of science. The implementation of the policy of "Science and Technology for Urban Development" is bringing new vitality to Longcheng.

Here, scientific research capabilities are strong. There are 98 independent research institutions of various sizes, some of which are well-known nationwide. There are also more than 100 non-independent research institutions and 28 colleges and universities. The city has 250,000 scientific and technological personnel, accounting for 15.6% of the total population. The advantages in science and technology are unique, but in the past, they have not been fully utilized. Many research achievements often remained dormant in the laboratories.

In early 1988, the policy of "Science and Technology for Urban Development," which aligns with the trend of the times, was issued by the municipal leadership and spread to all sectors and levels, becoming the coordinated action of the entire city.

People, as the decisive factor in implementing the policy of "Science and Technology for Urban Development," have been mobilized by a series of pioneering policies. A strong centripetal force has drawn a large number of scientific and technological personnel into the main battlefield of economic construction. In the past, people said that Longcheng could not retain talent, and it was called "The Peacock Flies to the Southeast." Now, it is "The Peacock Returns." A large number of scientific and technological personnel have left their deep courtyards and iron rice bowls, and have not eaten government rations, establishing 349 various private research institutions. They take the market as the guide, implement integration of science, industry, and trade, and inject unprecedented vitality into scientific and technological work. The city has also seen more than 1,300 "Sunday Engineers" who, under the organization of the "Sunday Engineers Association," engage in technical services in their spare time. Many enterprises that previously encountered technical difficulties and had no one to turn to now find solutions with the help of "Sunday Engineers."

The "Science and Technology Street" is a comprehensive science and technology market newly built after Longcheng proposed the policy of "Science and Technology for Urban Development." Along both sides of the approximately one-kilometer-long street, 82 science and technology development institutions are lined up, covering 10 major categories and 263 new technologies in electronics, computers, biotechnology, and other fields. Coming here is like entering a world of science and technology, where technology transfer, technical consultation, technical training, and many other categories provide comprehensive services, making scientific research and production here unusually active and integrated.

The establishment of the "Nanshan New Technology Industrial Park" has also painted an inspiring blueprint for Longcheng's "Science and Technology for Urban Development." In the 32-square-kilometer area of Nanhu and Nanshan, there are 18 colleges and universities, 39 research institutions, 12 design institutes, and more than 30 enterprises. In this "special zone," special policies have developed more than 150 high-tech projects and established a number of high-tech enterprises. Currently, the focus is on turning many modern high technologies into industrial advantages and accelerating the transformation of traditional industrial structures. Longcheng will surely soar in innovation and change!

    “科技城”的新活力
    孟天然　高英杰
    长春，人们常说她是汽车城，又赞美她为森林城。然而，你可知道，她又是一座科学城。“科技立市”方针的实施，正给长春带来新的活力。
    这里，科研力量雄厚。光是大小独立的科研机构就有98个，其中有些在国内很有名气。还有100多个非独立的科研机构、28所高等院校。全市拥有科技人员25万人之多，占市内总人口的15.6％。科技优势，得天独厚，然而，以往却没能得以充分发挥，大批的科研成果常常沉睡在研究室里。
    1988年初，“科技立市”这项顺乎时代潮流的大政方针由市里首脑机关输出，注入各行各业各层次人们的头脑，变成了全市人民协调一致的行动。
    人，作为实施“科技立市”方针的决定性因素，被一整套敢为人先的政策调动起来。一种强大的向心力使广大科技人员投入了经济建设的主战场。过去，人们说长春留不住人才，叫“孔雀东南飞”，如今是“孔雀不飞还回归”。大批科技人员走出深宅大院，不端“铁饭碗”，不吃“皇粮”，创办起349家各类民办科研机构。他们以市场为导向，实行科、工、贸一体化，给科技工作注入了空前的活力。全市还出现1300多名“星期日工程师”，在“星期日工程师协会”的组织下，利用业余时间从事技术服务。好多企业过去遇到技术难题苦于求助无门，而今，找到“星期日工程师”，便迎刃而解。
    “科技一条街”，是长春市提出“科技立市”后新建起来的一个综合科技市场。1公里左右的大街两侧，依次排列着82家科技开发机构，涉及电子、计算机、生物工程等10大类263项新技术。来到这里，犹如跻身于一个科技世界，技术转让、技术咨询、技术培训……众多的门类，周全的服务，使科研与生产在这里异常活跃地交流、结合。
    “南南新技术工业园区”的建立，更为长春“科技立市”描绘了振奋人心的蓝图。在南湖、南岭32平方公里的区域内，聚集着18所大专院校、39个科研单位、12个设计院及30多家企业。在这个“特区”里，特殊的政策，发展起150多个高新技术项目，并相应建立一批高新技术企业。眼下，人们的着眼点是让众多的现代高新技术发展成产业优势，加速传统产业结构的裂变。长春，也必将在裂变、创新中奋飞！
