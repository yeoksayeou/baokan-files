Leaving Yanjing County in Shanxi Province and driving west for twelve kilometers, passing by the famous Puji Temple, known for the love story in "The Romance of the Western Chamber," one arrives at the ancient city site of Chuzhou, which was renowned during the Tang Dynasty alongside the Eastern Capital Luoyang and the Western Capital Chang'an. Here, one can marvel at the "Iron Oxen That Tame the River."

There are four "Iron Oxen," arranged in two rows. Each ox is over a zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) long and weighs around 5,000 kilograms.

The "Iron Oxen" were cast during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty. Recently, through the efforts of the local government, these oxen have been unearthed and are now on display in Chuzhou for the first time. Their excavation provides important evidence for the study of ancient metallurgy, bridge construction, water conservation, and art history. Additionally, they add a new attraction to the Yellow River region. Since their unveiling, they have drawn visitors from all directions.

Though eroded by a thousand years of weathering and natural forces, the oxen remain sturdy and imposing. Their horns are raised high, eyes fierce, ears alert, and bones robust, making them appear lifelike. The craftsmanship is magnificent and rare in the world. It seems as if the oxen's roar echoes with the waves of the Yellow River, leaving visitors in awe. According to researchers, in the 12th year of the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty issued an edict ordering local officials to build a bridge to facilitate trade between Qin and Jin, turning the Yellow River into a smooth path. Thus, the people of Chuzhou cast four iron oxen on the stone embankment outside the Xijin Gate, each with an iron figure leading them. Behind the oxen, there were four iron mountains, surrounded by 36 iron pillars, forming an iron chain bridge across the Yellow River. The phrase "Long'an eats Lu salt" was then recorded in the "Book of Tang," and the legend of the river's spirit in the eastern region began to spread. Later, due to the Yellow River's floods, the bridge was destroyed, and the city was submerged. The "Iron Oxen That Tame the River" disappeared in the turbulent waves, leaving pious people calling for them in vain. They remained buried in the river's silt, giving rise to countless enchanting myths.

　　镇河大铁牛

    出山西永济县城，驱车西行十二公里，途经以《西厢记》的爱情故事而闻名遐迩的普救寺，来到唐时与东都洛阳、西都长安齐名的中都蒲州古城遗址，就可以领略“镇河大铁牛”的壮观。
    “镇河大铁牛”共有4尊，左右排列为两组，每尊身长丈余，体重约5000公斤。
  “铁牛”铸造于唐代开元年间，经过当地政府组织力量勘掘，近日在蒲州首次重现异彩。它的出土，既为研究古代冶金、桥梁、水利、美术等历史沿革提供了重要依据，又为黄河流域新添了一处吸引人的胜境。它刚刚“亮相”，就招徕了八方游客。
      “铁牛”虽经千百年的侵蚀和自然风化，但其形倔壮，矫角昂首，目怒耳晤，骨架壮硕，形态逼真，其工艺恢宏，为世罕见，仿佛“铁牛”哞哞的吼声与九曲黄河波涛声共鸣，游人无不啧啧称奇。据研究者介绍，唐开元12年，唐玄宗李隆基降旨，要求当地官府架桥沟通秦晋商贾，变黄河两岸为坦途。于是，百姓们在蒲州西侧蒲津门外护城石堤上，冶铸4头铁牛，各有铁人牵缰，且后置4座铁山，周围还有36根铁柱，一座铁索浮桥出现在滔滔黄河之上，“长安食潞盐”的文字便一跃载入了《唐书》，民间也从此留下了河东拥有镇河之灵的传说。后因黄河泛滥，桥毁城没，“镇河大铁牛”在肆虐的波涛声中失去了踪影，一任虔诚的人们千呼万唤，它却沉淤在黄河泥沙之下，从而产生出一串串勾人魂魄的神话来。
