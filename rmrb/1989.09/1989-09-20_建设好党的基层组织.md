Editor's Note:

	Strengthening the Party's Grassroots Organizations

	Strengthening the Party's construction is a crucial aspect of which is to strengthen the Party's grassroots organizations.

	The Communist Party of China has over 47 million members and nearly 3 million grassroots Party organizations. These are widely connected with the people. Party members live among the people as ordinary workers, and the Party's grassroots organizations are rooted among the people as the Party's strongholds in various grassroots units of society. The Party's correct leadership and its lines, principles, and policies must be implemented through the concrete work of the Party's grassroots organizations. When we talk about the Party's mass line, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and listening to the voices of the masses, we must do so through the bond that connects with the masses. Strengthening the Party's supervision and management must involve organizing each Party member into Party branches and cells to live an organized life. All this shows that how well each unit's Party organization functions relates not only to the Party's prestige among the people but also directly to the future of each unit: how fast it develops, how much it changes, how much it contributes, and how good its moral climate is.

	The countless facts since the reform and opening up have shown that building a good Party grassroots organization is indeed very important for our Party, country, society, and all the people. The reason our country has achieved such great success today, and many places have undergone a new look, is closely related to the effective work of the Party's grassroots organizations. However, we must also see that in some places, in the development of the commodity economy, only administrative, economic, or legal means are used, neglecting the role of the Party's grassroots organizations and the Party's ideological and political work, placing the Party's grassroots organizations in a dispensable position: whether the Party's work agencies exist or not does not matter much, resulting in some necessary political work departments being abolished; whether there are Party leaders or not does not affect the work, resulting in some secretaries being vacant for a long time; whether the Party's organizational life is conducted or not does not matter, resulting in Party members being long-term detached from the organization... This way, on the one hand, it causes the Party organization to be weak and dispersed, and on the other hand, it allows phenomena of power-seeking and corruption within the Party to breed, making many people misunderstand the Party. Although this situation is small in scale, its impact is great and cannot continue.

	To strengthen the Party's grassroots organizations, from the readers' feedback, the first thing is to make the Party's grassroots organizations complete, with a good and stable team, especially to select comrades with good political qualities and pioneering spirit to serve as the leaders of the Party branches. Second, Party members must be managed well, with strict organizational life, enhanced Party consciousness and discipline consciousness, timely education and handling of unqualified Party members, so that Party members can truly play a vanguard and exemplary role. Third, lead the masses, care for the masses, do a good job in the ideological and political work of the masses, enhance the Party's cohesion and attractiveness among the masses, and make the Party's leadership role truly manifested at the grassroots level.

### 建设好党的基层组织

　　建设好党的基层组织
    加强党的建设，很重要的一环是要加强党的基层组织建设。
    中国共产党有四千七百多万党员，近三百万个党的基层组织，同人民群众有着广泛的联系。党员是以普通劳动者的身份生活在群众之中，党的基层组织是以党在社会各基层单位中的战斗堡垒的形象扎根于群众之中。党的正确领导，党的路线、方针、政策，要依靠党的基层组织的具体工作体现出来。我们讲党的群众路线，发动群众，依靠群众，倾听群众的呼声，就必须通过联系群众的纽带来进行。加强党的监督管理，就必须把每个党员编入党的支部、小组中过组织生活。这些都说明，每个单位党组织的作用发挥得如何，既关系到党在人民群众中的威望，又直接关系到每个单位的前途：发展快不快？变化大不大？贡献多不多？风气正不正？
    改革开放以来的无数事实说明，建设一个好的党的基层组织，对于我们的党、国家、社会和全体人民，实在太重要了。我们国家之所以能取得今天如此巨大的成就，许许多多地方的面貌焕然一新，都是与党的基层组织卓有成效的工作有关。但也要看到，有些地方在发展商品经济中，只注意运用行政的或经济的或法律的手段，忽视了党的基层组织的作用和党的思想政治工作，把党的基层组织放在一个可有可无的地位：党的工作机构存在不存在关系不大，致使一些必要的政工部门被撤；党的负责人有没有不影响工作，致使有的书记长期缺额；党的组织生活过不过无所谓，致使党员长期游离于组织之外……这样，一方面造成党组织软弱涣散，一方面党内以权谋私、腐败现象得以滋生，使不少群众对党产生了误解。这种状况尽管面小，但影响很大，不能再继续下去了。
    抓好党的基层组织建设，从读者反映的情况看，首先必须将党的基层组织健全起来，配个好的、稳定的班子，尤其要选那些政治素质好、有开拓精神的同志出任党支部的领班人。第二，必须管好党员，严格组织生活，增强党员的党性观念、纪律观念，及时教育和处置不合格的党员，使党员切实发挥先锋模范作用。第三，要带领群众，关心群众，做好群众的思想政治工作，增强党在群众中的凝聚力和吸引力，使党的领导作用在基层中得到真正体现。
