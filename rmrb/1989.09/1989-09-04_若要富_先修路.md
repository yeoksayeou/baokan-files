In the forty years since the founding of the People's Republic, Yunnan Province's transportation industry has seen rapid development. By the end of 1988, the total length of roads in operation had reached 52,534 kilometers, 18.9 times more than in 1949. However, in terms of the entire province, the technical level of the roads is low, the road surface quality is poor, and the disaster resistance is weak. There are still 3,742 townships without road access, and the people's lives are relatively impoverished. In some areas, products cannot be transported out, and people have to travel 60-70 kilometers of mountain roads to buy a few pounds of salt. To transport a fat pig out of the village, several strong laborers are needed. In this situation, how can the economy be developed and poverty be alleviated! Therefore, backward transportation is an important factor constraining Yunnan's economic development.

To get rich, build roads first. Currently, the difficulties in building roads in border, mountainous, and ethnic minority areas are mainly twofold: first, it is difficult to build roads. These areas have high mountains and steep slopes, making the engineering work arduous. The construction cost per kilometer has exceeded several times, even tens of times, that of the 1950s and 1960s; second, it is difficult to secure funds. The funds for road construction are insufficient and far from meeting the required expenses. The "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and "Ninth Five-Year Plan" for transportation involve the construction and reconstruction of 8,020 kilometers of county and township roads, requiring an investment of 425 million yuan. If we add the reconstruction of the province's main trunk roads, other trunk roads, economic development roads, the connection of provincial interstate roads, and the construction of some important national defense roads, as well as the repair of post roads, suspension bridges for horses and people, and ferry crossings, the two five-year road construction plans will require 5.2 billion yuan. At the current investment level, it will take decades, even a hundred years, to achieve this. Therefore, to fundamentally improve the transportation conditions in Yunnan Province, which has many border, mountainous, and ethnic minority areas, the state must adopt special policies.

    若要富  先修路
    云南省交通厅　资正宣
    建国四十年来，云南的交通事业有了飞速发展。到一九八八年底，公路通车里程已达五万二千五百三十四公里，为一九四九年通车里程的十八点九倍多。但就全省而言，公路技术等级低、路面质量差、抗灾能力弱。全省还有三千七百四十二个乡镇未通公路，人民生活较为贫困。有的地区生产的产品运不出来，群众为买三、五斤盐巴必须跋涉六七十公里山路，交售一头肥猪必需几个强壮劳力抬出山村。这种状况，如何发展经济，脱贫致富！所以交通落后是制约云南经济发展的重要因素。
    若要富，先修路。目前，边疆、山区、少数民族地区的公路建设碰到的难题，一是修路难。这些地区山高坡陡，工程艰巨，每公里建设费用已超过五六十年代的几倍甚至十几倍；二是资金难。公路建设资金短缺，远远不能满足所需费用。“八五”、
  “九五”交通规划新建、改建县乡公路八千零二十公里，需投资四点二五亿元。如果加上全省主干道公路改造、其它干线公路改造、经济开发路的建设、接通省际断头路以及兴修一些重要的国防公路，还有整修驿道、人马吊桥、渡口等等，两个五年公路建设规划需资金五十二亿余元。按现行投资水平，需数十年甚至上百年的时间才能实现。所以，要使边疆、山区、少数民族众多的云南省交通条件有个根本改善，国家必须采取特殊的政策。
