On the afternoon of September 24, leaders of various Chinese associations in France and over 2,000 Chinese residents gathered in the grand hall of the "Mutual Aid Home" in Paris to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The event was sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Association of France, the European Times, the Chinese Mutual Aid Association of France, the French Chaozhou Association, the French Shanghai Friendship Association, the Paris Office of China International Airlines, the Overseas Chinese Association of France, the Overseas Chinese Association of Guangfu, the Overseas Chinese Sports Association of France, the French Chinese Sports Association, the Paris Branch of the Bank of China, the Chinese Business Building in France, the Chen Brothers Company, the Jia Hua Company, and the Guangnan Tai Bakery, among others. The celebration was grand and lively, filled with a strong sense of hometown affection.

In the center of the stage, two vibrant red flags with five stars were hung side by side. On the stage, there were more than 10 large flower baskets presented by various associations. The attendees included venerable elders and young, energetic individuals. Among them were successful businesspeople who had contributed to France's economy, culture, and society, as well as outstanding students from primary, secondary, and tertiary education.

Han Tianjin, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Association of France, was the first to address the gathering. He said, "We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China far away from our homeland, and our hearts are surging like the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers." He pointed out, "The achievements of the past 40 years are well-known to the world, they are indisputable facts. Over the past 10 years, the People's Republic of China has embarked on the path of reform and opening up. Although we have encountered difficulties on this journey, we believe that the 1.1 billion descendants of the Yellow Emperor, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, will surely unite and overcome all obstacles and difficulties, building this Eastern nation, which accounts for one-quarter of the world's population, into a modern and powerful country. This is the confidence of all overseas Chinese in France, and it is our unshakable hope."

Ambassador Zhou Juefu and his wife led the embassy's leaders and staff to attend the celebration. Accompanied by leaders of the associations and businesspeople, Zhou blew out the candles on the birthday cake for the 40th anniversary of the motherland, to the applause of the audience.

In his speech, Ambassador Zhou said, "China's achievements and progress have not only laid a solid foundation for the happiness of the Chinese people and the prosperity of the nation, opening up a broad prospect, but have also made significant contributions to world peace, development, and the progress of humanity that are unparalleled and undeniable." He told the overseas Chinese that after 11 years of adhering to the policy of reform and opening up, the face of the motherland has undergone significant changes, with a thriving and vibrant scene everywhere. He expressed heartfelt thanks to the broad masses of overseas Chinese for their understanding and support in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and noted that some misunderstandings due to lack of knowledge are understandable. He happily told everyone, "China's current political situation is stable; the economic situation is good; our policy of reform and opening up will not only not change, but the pace of progress will be more stable, better, and even faster." He highly praised the overseas Chinese for their invaluable support for the construction of the motherland and their efforts to promote Sino-French friendship.

The cultural performances at the celebration were spectacular. Overseas artists and amateur performers presented lion dances, Peking opera, mime, and martial arts. Renowned Chinese tenor Jiang Jiaqian, who had come specially from Beijing, and young soprano Zhou Jianxia, known as the "Chinese Nightingale," took turns performing on stage. The two singers performed 20 solo and duet songs. Jiang Jiaqian's performance of the Wenzhou drum ballad "Hometown Feelings" in the Ruian dialect once again brought the audience into deep nostalgia.

Before the celebration ended, the conference read out a telegram sent to the CCTV National Day Gala in Beijing. The telegram expressed the "heart-pounding, blood-boiling" feelings of the overseas Chinese in France, their longing and love for the motherland. The telegram concluded by saying, "The overseas Chinese in France offer a cup of the sweetest and most fragrant honey wine to the motherland, wishing the motherland to become stronger, more prosperous, and more flourishing every day."

    ——旅法华侨华人热烈庆祝新中国成立四十周年

    9月24日下午，法国各侨团领导人和2000多侨胞，在巴黎“互助之家”大礼堂举行了庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年联欢会。旅法华侨俱乐部、法国《欧洲时报》在法国华裔互助会、法国潮州同乡会、法国上海联谊会、中国国际航空公司驻巴黎办事处、旅法崇正总会、旅法广肇同乡会、旅法海青体育会、法华体育会、中国银行驻巴黎分行、法国中国商业大楼、法国陈氏兄弟公司、嘉华公司、广南泰饼家等单位鼎力赞助，使联欢会开得隆重热烈，充满了浓郁的乡情。
    在舞台正中，并排悬挂着两面鲜艳的五星红旗，舞台正中与两侧是各侨团敬献的10多个大花篮。与会的侨胞，有德高望重的长者，也有英姿勃勃的年轻人。他们之中，既有为法国经济、文化、社会做出过贡献、事业有成的工商界人士，也有学业成绩优异的大、中、小学生。
    旅法华侨俱乐部主席韩天进首先致词，他说：“我们在远离祖国千山万水的地方庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年，心潮澎湃，如长江、黄河之水”。他指出，“40年的成就是举世共知的，是铁的事实，是不容抹煞的。近10年来，中华人民共和国又走上了改革开放的道路，尽管在前进的道路上遇到困难，但我们相信，11亿炎黄子孙在中国共产党和中国政府的领导下，一定会团结一致，克服种种障碍和困难，把占世界1／4人口的东方大国建设成一个现代的强国。这是我们全体旅法华侨、华人的信心，也是我们永远不动摇的希望。”
    驻法大使周觉夫妇亲自率领使馆各部门领导和工作人员到会同庆节日。周大使在侨团领导人和工商界人士的陪同下登台，吹熄了祖国40周年生日大蛋糕上的蜡烛，台上台下一片掌声。
    周大使在节日祝词中指出，“中国的成就和进步，不仅为祖国的人民幸福、国家富强奠定了坚实的基础，开拓了广阔的前景，而且也为世界的和平、发展和人类进步事业做出了举世瞩目的、谁也否认不了的巨大贡献”。他告诉侨胞，坚持改革开放11年，祖国的面貌发生了显著变化，到处充满着兴旺发达、生机勃勃的景象。他对广大侨胞对平息反革命暴乱的理解和支持表示衷心的感谢，并指出因不了解真情而产生的一些误解不足为奇。他高兴地告诉大家，“中国目前的政局是稳定的；经济形势也是好的；我们的改革开放政策不仅不会改变，而且前进的步伐将会迈得更稳、更好，甚至更快”。他高度评价侨胞对祖国建设事业给予的难能可贵的支持和为促进中法友谊作出的努力。
    联欢会的文艺表演精彩纷呈。旅法艺术家和文艺爱好者演出了舞狮、京剧、哑剧、武术等节目，专程从北京前来的我国著名一级男高音歌唱家姜嘉锵与有“中国百灵鸟”美誉的青年女高音歌唱家周建霞轮流上台献歌，两位歌唱家先后歌唱了20支独唱重唱歌曲，姜嘉锵以瑞安话演唱的温州鼓词《故乡情》，再次把人们带进深深的乡思之中。
    联欢会结束前，大会宣读了向北京中央电视台国庆联欢晚会拍发的电报，电文表达了“心在跳跃，热血沸腾”的旅法海外游子“对祖国无限向往与热爱”之情，电文最后说，旅法侨胞向祖国“敬上一杯最浓最香的蜜酒，祝祖国日益强大，繁荣昌盛。”
