Ma'anshan Evaluates Titles for Political Work Cadres
First Batch of Over 3,000 Receive Titles and Are Appointed

MA'ANSHAN, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) — The city of Ma'anshan in Anhui province began evaluating professional titles for political work cadres last June. After thorough investigation and repeated reviews, the first batch of 3,714 political work cadres have recently been awarded the titles of Senior Manager, Manager, Assistant Manager, and Trainee Manager, and have been appointed accordingly. During their tenure, they will enjoy the same treatment as other professional title holders. This will play a significant role in stabilizing and developing the political work team.

This evaluation work was conducted meticulously. For instance, the Ma'anshan Steel Company, following the instructions of the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee, formulated the "Provisional Regulations on Political Work Professional Titles," defining the professional titles as the aforementioned "four managers." The evaluation targets were political work personnel engaged in party affairs, propaganda, military affairs, security, and mass organizations.

    马鞍山为政工干部评职称
    首批三千多人获职称并被聘用
    本报马鞍山9月22日电  记者张振国报道：安徽省马鞍山市去年6月开始着手为政工干部评定专业职称。经过全面摸底、反复评审，第一批3714名政工干部，最近分别获得高级管理师、管理师、助理管理师和实习管理师职称，并被聘用。受聘期间，享受与其他专业职称同等待遇。这对稳定和发展政工队伍将起很大作用。
    这次评审工作做得很细。如马钢公司就根据马鞍山市委的指示，制定了《政工专业职务试行条例》，把专业名称定为上述“四师”。评审对象为从事党务、宣传、武装、保卫、群团组织的政工人员。
