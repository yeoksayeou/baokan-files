From September 5 to 9, the People's Navy held a conference in Weihai City, Shandong Province, to exchange experiences on military-civilian unity. Some representatives attending the conference said, "Weihai City is truly a 'City of Military Support'!" Admiral Li Yaowen, the political commissar of the Navy, also highly praised the contributions made by the cadres and masses of Weihai City to the construction of the Navy.

Weihai City was a revolutionary base during the war years and has a glorious tradition of supporting the military. In the new situation of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity production, the people of this prefecture-level city, which includes Rongcheng City, Wendiang City, Rushan County, and Huancui District, have inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the past, and have not forgotten to support the military and take care of military families despite their prosperity. They are praised as the "City of Military Support."

	Doing Practical Things – Better Than Family

Before the August 1st holiday this year, the main leaders of the Weihai Municipal Committee and the Rongcheng Municipal Committee visited the Navy's fast boat squadron stationed on Shidao Island. Upon learning that the squadron's water wells had been infiltrated by seawater, making it difficult for the soldiers to drink good water, they said with concern, "The soldiers are so hardworking, patrolling and guarding at sea every day, and they have to drink salty water. This matter cannot be delayed for a single day; it must be resolved immediately." The two levels of leadership immediately instructed the Party Committee Secretary of Shidao Town to handle this matter. Later, the town Party Committee Secretary convened relevant personnel and said, "The matter of the military drilling wells, we must provide all the conveniences. Wherever the military chooses, we will drill there. The military can start drilling after choosing the location and handle the procedures later." Soon, clean and sweet well water flowed into the barracks.

Weihai does not produce coal, and the quota for living coal has not been adjusted for many years. Last winter, the business section chief of the Huancui District Fuel Company visited the troops and found that some units could not even heat one stove per squad. The soldiers could not stretch their hands during daytime study or their legs at night. Some soldiers' hands were frozen with blue and purple patches. Seeing this, this retired soldier who had rolled around in the military for more than ten years had tears in his eyes. Upon returning to the company, he immediately reported to the leadership. The company leadership immediately decided to adopt the method of price negotiation to supply the military with coal for heating. At the same time, it was decided that for other coal projects used by the military, if the monthly planned allocation is insufficient, the difference will also be supplemented by the price negotiation method. For this, the company reduces its income by more than 100,000 yuan each year.

Children's difficulty in entering kindergartens and schools is a major problem today. However, the people of Weihai would rather make it difficult for themselves than for the military. For the children of military officers entering schools and kindergartens, they give full green light and special care. Shidao Town is small and densely populated, making it difficult to enter kindergartens and schools. Shidao Primary School is the best school in the area, and it is even more difficult to enter this school. However, this school stipulates that as long as it is the children of military officers, they will be accepted whenever they come. The Shidao Town Kindergarten also accepts the children of military officers whenever they come.

Weihai City has realized in its practice of supporting the military that sending money and goods is not as good as providing good living conditions. The municipal government saw that there are many Navy units in the Weihai Water Police District and allocated 50 mu of vegetable fields to them free of charge. Technical personnel were also sent to guide vegetable planting, making it possible for the military to be self-sufficient for 70% of their vegetable needs.

	Upholding the Great Cause – Prioritizing the "Let" Principle

With the development of socialist planned commodity economy, there will inevitably be some conflicts of interest between local authorities and the military. Whenever such situations arise, the cadres and masses of Weihai City always prioritize the overall situation and put the "let" principle first, not just handling military-civilian relations with commercial exchange principles.

In early 1987, just after the Spring Festival, the manager of the Fishery Company in Wahuishi Town, Rongcheng City, excitedly found someone to design a four-story building. Just as they were laying the foundation and marking the lines, the commander of a nearby radar station came to the door:

"Manager, your building can only be built to three stories. Building four stories will affect the normal operation of the radar." Without a second thought, the manager immediately found someone to revise the drawings and prepared materials and prefabricated components according to the requirements of a three-story building. Just as the foundation was being laid, the radar station commander came to the door again: "Manager, we have carefully measured, and building a three-story building will still affect the radar's field of vision. You can only build a single-story building." The manager was very troubled, but he still readily accepted the military's requirements.

The news spread, and many people could not understand. They found the manager and said: We agreed to build three stories, and now it has changed again. This time we will lose more than 100,000 yuan. How can our small company of more than 60 people afford it? We must let the military compensate for the loss.

The company leadership patiently explained to the fishermen: "We must prioritize the overall situation of national defense construction and not quibble over small matters."

	Diligently Exploring – Forever Vibrant

The cadres and masses of Weihai City, like pursuing rapid economic development, are constantly exploring how to strengthen military-civilian unity in the new historical period.

Weihai Tire Factory, in response to the situation where young workers in the new historical period lack understanding of the soldiers, carried out the "Open the Window to See Each Other" activity with a certain submarine of the Navy. Young workers, through visiting the ship, understood the hardships of sailors' lives, and increased their love for the soldiers. Young soldiers, seeing workers working hard under difficult conditions, also increased their understanding and affection for the workers. From then on, the two sides often visited each other, exchanged ideas, strengthened feelings, and deepened friendships. Many units in the city learned from their experience, opened their doors, and established friendly relations, making the people and the soldiers understand each other more, have fewer misunderstandings, more consensus, and fewer differences.

The Stone Island Forest Farm in Rongcheng City and a certain communication station of the military are located on the same mountain. In 1986, the forest farm was just established, and the conditions were very harsh. Many young people were not willing to work in the forest farm, playing cards and chess during work hours. The soldiers of the communication station saw this situation and actively talked to the young people in the forest farm, and helped the forest farm build a study and entertainment area, and installed a television. Life in the mountain valley became interesting, and the young people no longer wanted to go down the mountain.

Some soldiers of the communication station were not willing to be stationed on the mountain for many years. The director and deputy director of the forest farm had both served in the military on islands, so they spoke from their own experience to encourage the soldiers. Especially when old soldiers retired, the director and deputy director would go to talk to the retiring soldiers, using their own experiences to encourage the soldiers to build confidence in creating new businesses after retirement.

The leadership of various levels in Weihai City has also established systems such as two-way contact, soliciting opinions, visiting and comforting, and on-site office work, making the city's military support work more lively.

    名不虚传的“拥军城”
    ——威海市支援部队建设纪事
    綦国瑞　邱明波　李成华
    9月5日至9日，人民海军在山东省威海市召开了军政军民团结经验交流会。一些与会代表说，威海市真是一座“拥军城”！海军政委李耀文上将在会上讲话时，也高度赞扬了威海市干部和群众为海军部队建设作出了贡献。
    威海市在战争年代是革命根据地，具有光荣的拥军传统。在改革开放和发展社会主义商品生产的新形势下，这个辖有荣成市、文登市、乳山县及环翠区的地级市人民，继承和发扬过去的优良传统，富裕不忘拥军优属，被人们誉为“拥军城”。
            办实事　胜似亲人
    今年“八·一”前夕，威海市委、荣成市委的两级主要负责人，来到海军驻石岛某快艇大队走访，得知部队水井被海水渗透，战士们一直吃不上好水时，心疼地说：“战士们成天在海上值勤巡逻那么辛苦，竟然吃的是咸水，这件事一天也不能再拖了，马上就着手解决。”两级领导当场责成石岛镇党委书记办好这件事。此后，镇党委书记召集有关人员说：“部队打井的事，我们要提供一切方便，部队看好哪里，就在哪里打。部队找好地方后可以先打井，后补办手续。”不久，清甜的井水流进了营房。
    威海这里不产煤，生活用煤的指标十几年没调整。去年冬天，环翠区燃料公司业务科负责人到部队走访时，发现有些单位一个班还生不上一个炉子，战士们在屋里白天学习伸不出手，晚上睡觉伸不开腿，有些战士手冻得青一块、紫一块。看到这种情景，这位在部队滚爬了十多年的退伍老兵，眼眶湿润了。回到公司，他立即向领导作了汇报。公司领导立即研究决定：采取议价转平价的办法供应部队烤火用煤。同时决定，部队其它项目的用煤，月计划分配数量不够的，也按议价转平价的办法，差多少补多少。为此，公司每年减少10万多元的收入。
    孩子入托入学难，是当前的一大难题。但是，威海人民宁难自己，也不难部队。对部队干部子女入学、入托全部绿灯放行，而且还给予特殊的照顾。石岛镇地狭人多，入托、上学都很困难，石岛小学是当地最好的学校，入这个学校就更难了。但是，这个学校却规定，凡是部队干部子女，什么时候来，什么时候收。石岛镇幼儿园对部队干部子女，也是随来随收。
    威海市在拥军的实践中体会到，送钱送物不如送个提高生活的好条件。市政府看到海军威海水警区部队较多，就无偿拨给了50亩菜地，并派出技术人员指导种菜，使部队吃菜70％能够自给。
            明大义“让”字在先
    随着社会主义有计划的商品经济发展，地方和部队也会出现一些利益方面的冲突。每逢这种情况，威海市干部、群众总是以大局为重，“让”字在先，不单是用商品交换原则处理军地利益关系。
    1987年春节刚过，荣成市俚岛镇瓦屋石渔业公司经理，兴冲冲找人设计了一座四层大楼。正在打桩放线的时候，附近某部雷达站站长找上了门：
  “经理，你们的楼房只能盖三层，盖四层就会影响雷达的正常工作。”经理二话没说立即找人重新修改了图纸，并按三层楼房的要求准备了材料和预制件。在地基刚刚砌好时，雷达站站长又找上了门：“经理，我们经过仔细测量，盖三层楼还会影响雷达的视野，您只能盖平房了。”经理甚感为难，但还是痛快地接受了部队的要求。
    消息传开，不少人想不通。他们找到经理说：讲好了盖三层，又变了卜，这下要损失10万多元，咱们一个60多人的小公司怎么吃得消，得让部队包赔损失。
    公司领导耐心地对渔民说：“我们要以国防建设大局为重，不能斤斤计较。”
              勤探索　永葆活力
    威海市干部、群众像追求经济迅速发展一样，不断探索在新的历史时期中如何搞好军民团结。
    威海轮胎厂针对新的历史时期青年工人对子弟兵缺乏了解的状况，与海军某猎潜艇开展了“打开窗户看对方”的活动。青年工人通过参观舰艇，了解水兵生活的艰苦，增强了对子弟兵的爱。青年战士看到工人在艰苦的条件下忘我劳动，也增强了对工人的理解和感情。以此为始双方经常往来，交流了思想，密切了感情，增进了友谊。全市不少单位学习他们的经验，敞开大门，互相联谊，使人民群众与子弟兵之间多了理解，少了误会；多了共识，少了分歧。
    荣成市石岛林场与某部观通站同住在土步山上。1986年林场刚刚组建，条件非常艰苦，许多青年不安心林场工作，上班时间甩扑克、下象棋。观通站官兵见到这种情况主动找林场青年谈心，并帮林场建起了学习与娱乐园地，安上了电视机。山沟里的生活有了乐趣，青年们也不再吵着下山了。
    观通站有的战士因常年驻守在山上不安心，林场场长和副场长都在海岛当过兵，就现身说法开导战士。特别是每当老战士退伍时，场长、副场长都靠上去同退役战士谈心，用自己切身经历开导战士树立退役后再创新业的信心。
    威海市各级领导机关和领导干部还建立了双向联系制度、征询意见制度、走访慰问制度、现场办公制度等，使全市的拥军优属工作越来越活。
