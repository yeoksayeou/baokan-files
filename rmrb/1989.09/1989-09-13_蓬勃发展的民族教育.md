Thriving Ethnic Education

In China, for every 10,000 people, there are an average of 1,167 primary school students. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for every 10,000 Mongolian people, there are 76 more primary school students than the national average. The region also has more junior high school students and college students among its Mongolian population compared to the national average.

The region's policy of prioritizing and focusing on the development of ethnic education has fundamentally changed the situation of backward ethnic education and low cultural standards among the grassland herdsmen.

Over the past 40 years, when formulating education development plans and annual plans, the region has prioritized ethnic education; when drafting enrollment plans and setting enrollment ratios, it has appropriately considered minority students; and in the allocation of personnel, funds, and materials, it has prioritized ethnic education.

To cultivate bilingual ethnic talents proficient in both Mongolian and Chinese, the region has actively created conditions to implement Mongolian-language instruction for the majority of Mongolian students. The Inner Mongolia Education Press, which specializes in publishing Mongolian textbooks, has ensured the timely supply of Mongolian textbooks for schools at all levels. The "teacher training first" policy has significantly accelerated the construction of the ethnic teacher team.

Considering the unique conditions of the pastoral areas, such as scattered residences, economic poverty, and inconvenient transportation, the region has focused on developing public ethnic primary and secondary schools in the pastoral areas. These schools primarily operate on a boarding basis and provide scholarships (referred to as "two main and one public"). By 1987, all 80 county-level centers in the border areas had achieved "two main and one public." From last year to this year, the region has allocated 10 million yuan annually to further achieve "two main and one public" in 350 county-level centers within the region. Currently, nearly 300 new school buildings have been built along the 8,000-li border line within the region.

When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established in early 1947, there were only 4 ethnic middle schools and 377 ethnic primary schools. Now, there are 383 ethnic middle schools and 3,216 ethnic primary schools. Currently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has formed a basic ethnic education system that includes schools, teachers, textbooks, educational research, and education management.

　　蓬勃发展的民族教育
    在我国每万名人口中，平均有小学生1167人，而在内蒙古自治区，每万名蒙古族人口拥有的小学生，比全国平均数多76人。该自治区蒙古族人口中拥有的普通高中生和普通高等学校学生，也比全国平均数多。
    自治区实行的优先、重点发展民族教育的方针，已经从根本上改变了这里民族教育落后、草原牧民文化水准低的状况。
    40年来，自治区在制定教育事业发展规划和年度计划时，民族教育被放在优先的地位；在编制招生计划、规定招生比例时，适当照顾少数民族学生；在人、财、物的分配上，优先安排民族教育。
    为了培养蒙汉兼通的民族人才，自治区积极创造条件实现对多数蒙古族学生以蒙语授课为主。专门出版蒙文教材的内蒙古教育出版社，保证了各级各类学校蒙文教材的及时供应。“师范先行”的方针大大加快了民族师资队伍的建设。
    自治区根据牧区居住分散、经济贫困和交通不便等特殊情况，着重在牧区发展公办民族中小学，这些学校以寄宿为主，助学金为主（简称“两主一公”）。到1987年，边境的80个苏木（乡）中心校，全部实现“两主一公”。从去年到今年，自治区每年拨款1000万元，进一步实现区内350个苏木中心校的“两主一公”。现在，自治区境内的8000里边防线上，已经出现了近300所校舍全新的苏木中心小学。
    1947年初建时的内蒙古自治区，只有4所民族中学、377所民族小学。如今，民族中学已发展到383所，民族小学达到3216所。目前，内蒙古自治区已经形成了学校、教师、教材、教育科研以至教育管理基本配套的民族教育体系。
