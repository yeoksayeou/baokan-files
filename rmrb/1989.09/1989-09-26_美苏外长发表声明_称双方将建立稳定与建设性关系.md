	U.S. and Soviet Foreign Ministers Issue Joint Statement
	Declare Aim to Establish Stable and Constructive Relationship

	WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) — U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, after two days of talks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, issued a joint statement on Sept. 23. They declared that the common goal of the United States and the Soviet Union is to "establish a more stable, constructive, and enduring relationship," one that will see "openness and cooperation increasingly replace mistrust and competition."

	The statement said that although the two countries have significant differences on some issues, the foreign ministers believe that continued efforts and a commitment to open and frank dialogue, as well as finding practical and specific solutions, will make it possible to further expand the areas of dialogue in U.S.-Soviet relations.

	The statement said the foreign ministers discussed in detail nuclear weapons and space weapons issues. Both sides believe that, in the absence of an agreement on defensive and space weapons, the new Soviet proposals on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty have opened the way for reaching and implementing a strategic arms reduction treaty. The United States said it would invite Soviet experts to visit two U.S. facilities engaged in strategic defense research. The Soviet Union declared that, to strengthen the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, it would dismantle the radar station in Krasnoyarsk and expressed concern about U.S. radar stations in Greenland and the United Kingdom. The United States agreed to consider the Soviet concerns. To advance nuclear talks, the United States announced it would withdraw its proposal to ban mobile missiles.

	The statement also said that the United States and the Soviet Union signed a memorandum of understanding on the inspection of chemical weapons. Both sides agreed to provide advance notification of major strategic military exercises and to strengthen the means of monitoring nuclear tests.

    美苏外长发表声明
    称双方将建立稳定与建设性关系
    本报华盛顿9月24日电　记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在美国怀俄明州杰克逊霍尔举行两天会谈后，于23日发表一项声明，宣称美苏两国的共同目标是“建立一种更为稳定的、建设性的持久关系”，这种关系将使“开放性和合作不断替代不信任和竞争”。
    声明说，虽然两国在一些问题上存在着重大分歧，但两国外长认为，只要继续努力，共同致力于开诚布公的对话，寻找实际具体的解决办法，进一步扩大美苏关系中的对话领域是可能的。
    声明说，两国外长详细讨论了核武器问题和太空武器问题。双方认为，在未达成一项关于防御和太空武器协定的情况下，苏联关于反弹道导弹条约采取的新主张，为达成并执行一项削减战略武器条约开辟了道路。美国表示将邀请苏联政府的专家参观两个美国从事战略防御研究的机构。苏联声明，为加强反弹道导弹条约，它将撤除克拉斯诺亚尔斯克雷达站，并对美国设在格陵兰和英国的雷达站表示关切。美国答应考虑苏联的这一关注。为推动核谈判，美国宣布它将收回禁止机动导弹的建议。
    声明还说，美苏双方签订了一项关于核查化学武器的谅解备忘录。双方同意提前通报重大的战略军事演习，同意加强对核试验的监视手段。
