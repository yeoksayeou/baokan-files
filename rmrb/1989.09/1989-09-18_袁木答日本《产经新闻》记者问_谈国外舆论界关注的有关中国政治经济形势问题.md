According to a report by *Economic Daily* reporter, on September 16, Yuan Mu, spokesperson of the State Council, accepted an interview with a group of reporters from the Japanese *Sankei Shimbun* who were invited by the *Economic Daily* to visit China. He answered some questions about China's political and economic situation that are of interest to the international media.

Q: On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we feel that China has achieved great success in the past 40 years, although there have been some setbacks in the process. After the "June 4th Incident," where will China go? This is a question of great concern to the Japanese people.

A: After the recent turmoil, our leaders have repeatedly stated that China's established goals and basic policies will not change. The overall direction is still to achieve socialist modernization, to focus on economic construction, and to adhere to the basic line of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up. Some Western countries always say that China's policies have changed after the suppression of the turmoil, which is their misunderstanding or they have never correctly understood China's reform and opening up. They mistakenly believe that China's reform and opening up in the economy is to privatize, in politics to pluralize, and in culture to fully Westernize. We will never take this path. Our established policies will not change, and the direction of achieving socialist modernization will not change.

China's economic development strategy is still divided into three steps. The first step, starting from 1980, aims to double the national income and basically solve the problem of people's subsistence, which has already been achieved. The second step is to double the national income again by the end of this century, bringing people's living standards to a moderately prosperous level. We are now striving to achieve this goal, although we will encounter many difficulties, but we are confident that this goal can be achieved. The third step is to take another 50 years to reach the per capita national income level of a moderately developed country.

In diplomacy, we will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy. We will stand on the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world, independently and autonomously handle international relations and bilateral relations with other countries, and will not be interfered with by any external forces. We will continue to strive for world peace and oppose hegemony. We will adhere to two principles: one is to strive to establish a new international political order on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the other is to strive to establish a new international economic order on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and to develop economic relations with other countries.

Q: Last September, I came to China, and now I am here again. When passing by Tiananmen Square, I saw soldiers from the martial law troops. We are now very concerned about when the martial law will be lifted?

A: First, let me explain the meaning of martial law in certain areas of Beijing. I don't know how the word "martial law" is translated into Japanese, but in English, it is translated as "martial law," which cannot accurately reflect the meaning of our martial law. Martial law generally implies military control. Military control often means that the government has lost control of the situation, so the military takes control. Now, the Central People's Government, that is, the State Council, exercises martial law in certain areas of Beijing in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution. The People's Liberation Army carries out martial law tasks according to the government's orders, that is, it guards certain important institutions and transportation hubs. It does not interfere with any state affairs or social and economic life, but only plays a role in maintaining social order. After the implementation of martial law, the chaotic situation three months ago has ended, and the order in the capital has basically returned to normal. The stability of the capital promotes the stability of the whole country. Continuing martial law in certain areas of the capital for a period of time is an important factor in ensuring the stability of the capital and the country.

Currently, martial law has not been lifted mainly because a few rioters have not been completely apprehended and lawfully dealt with, and some of the weapons seized by the rioters are still scattered in society and have not been completely retrieved. Now, martial law has been gradually relaxed, checkpoints have been reduced, and the general public can visit and participate in activities at Tiananmen Square in an organized manner. The life of the people in the capital is normal. Of course, martial law is temporary, but it will be maintained for a period of time.

Incidentally, some Western countries take the lifting of martial law in China as a precondition and propose that if martial law is not lifted, they will not engage with China. This is an interference in China's internal affairs. Such a proposal is absolutely unacceptable to us. In fact, continuing martial law for a period of time does not affect our exchanges with the outside world. You came to China for an interview, and you were not affected, right!

Q: What is the former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, doing now? How will he be dealt with in the future?

A: Comrade Zhao Ziyang made serious mistakes in supporting turmoil and splitting the party within the party. His problem is still an internal party issue. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in June this year, according to the Party Constitution and democratic procedures, after discussion by all members of the Central Committee and unanimous adoption of a resolution, he was removed from his positions as General Secretary, Standing Committee member, Political Bureau member, and Central Committee member. The Party is still continuing to investigate his case. How to deal with him in the future will be based on his actual mistakes.

Q: Where is Mr. Zhao Ziyang living now? Is his daily life free?

A: His daily life is free, and his original living conditions have not changed. He still lives in Beijing.

Q: Is Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping in good health? There are some reports in the West about Deng Xiaoping's health. Will Deng Xiaoping appear during the National Day celebrations?

A: I can tell you that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is in very good health. Tonight (September 16th), you can see his demeanor on television. If our meeting were changed to tomorrow, you would definitely not ask this question. Some news media in the West and Hong Kong and Taiwan have been making a fuss about Deng Xiaoping's health issue, spreading rumors, which is really despicable and disgusting.

Q: There is a problem of regional economic imbalance in China's economic development, with imbalances between coastal and inland areas. What is your view on this?

A: China is a large country, and there is a serious problem of economic development imbalance between regions, which is an objective fact. After 10 years of efforts, China has basically solved the problem of subsistence for its 1.1 billion people, which is a great achievement. However, so far, there are still about several thousand people in some regions whose subsistence problem has not been solved. These regions are usually called "old, minority, and border" regions, that is, old revolutionary base areas, minority areas, and remote areas with relatively poor natural conditions. These regions have a large gap compared to some economically developed coastal and inland areas. Our policy is to continue to support the development of coastal areas and encourage them to put raw materials and markets overseas as much as possible to develop an export-oriented economy. At the same time, we encourage economic cooperation between coastal and inland areas, using coastal funds, technology, and talents to support the development of inland areas, striving to gradually narrow the gap. Of course, this will take some time and cannot be achieved in a short period. Some inland areas with relatively abundant resources are undergoing significant changes. For example, Shanxi, due to economic cooperation with coastal areas, the development of coal resources has accelerated compared to the past, and the economic situation of the province is much better than before. For some extremely poor areas with very few resources, the state has allocated special poverty alleviation funds to support the economic development of these areas.

Q: China will continue to adhere to reform and opening up, and we have fully understood this. Now, China is implementing economic rectification and adjustment, which will have what impact on the development prospects of China's agriculture, township enterprises, and individual economy?

A: The core issue of economic rectification and adjustment is to curb inflation and gradually ease the contradiction between social total demand and total supply caused by the overheating of the economy in the past few years. We are currently further studying and formulating the overall plan for economic rectification and adjustment, further clarifying the goals, time, steps, and policy measures for economic adjustment. An important issue in adjusting the economy is to gradually solve the problem of agriculture stagnation and strive to develop agriculture. We will also, under the premise of maintaining the overall balance of the total amount, adjust the industrial structure and investment structure reasonably, implement a policy of tilting towards agriculture and basic industries and infrastructure, and appropriately control the scale and speed of development of the processing industry. The price structure will also be adjusted accordingly. We will appropriately raise the prices of agricultural products, mainly grain and cotton, and certain important raw materials, to support the development of agriculture and energy and raw materials industries. For township enterprises, our policy can be summarized as follows: the development speed should be appropriately reduced, the industrial structure should be reasonably adjusted, the technical level should be further improved, and the management and management style should be seriously improved. The overall policy is still to develop, but to guide it correctly. For the individual economy, we will continue to encourage its appropriate development while strengthening necessary macro-management, so that it can better play a necessary and beneficial supplementary role to the public economy.

Q: Why has China significantly increased transportation costs? Currently, there are still two prices for agricultural products. Is the focus of price adjustment the state price? To what extent will the state price be adjusted?

A: Recently, we have raised the prices of railway, waterway, and air passenger transport, but not the freight prices. It is estimated that this will not have a significant impact on the overall price level. China's transportation industry has long implemented a low-price policy, and many passenger ticket prices have not been adjusted since the 1950s, which is no longer in proportion to other price levels, causing serious losses in the transportation industry. If the prices are not adjusted, it will be difficult to continue. This increase in passenger ticket prices will be beneficial to the development of China's transportation industry, and the Chinese people will understand this.

The adjustment of agricultural product prices is mainly to gradually and appropriately raise the prices of agricultural products contracted by the state to farmers. Of course, these prices will still be lower than market prices. Chinese farmers have the obligation to actively sell grain and other agricultural products to the state. After completing the contracted purchase tasks, they can still sell surplus grain and other products to the market. The situation of two prices will not be eliminated in the short term.

Q: Now, the national issue in the Soviet Union is a very headache problem. What policies and measures will China adopt for the issue of ethnic minorities?

A: We have always adhered to the policy of equality, mutual assistance, and respect for ethnic minorities. In ethnic minority areas, according to the Constitution and laws, ethnic regional autonomy is implemented, and the autonomy rights of ethnic minorities are firmly respected and protected. We have always respected the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, respected their religious beliefs, guaranteed the use of their own ethnic languages and scripts, and encouraged and promoted the majority ethnic group, mainly the Han nationality, to help ethnic minority areas develop their economy and culture. Since the founding of New China, various ethnic minority areas have trained a large number of cadres of their own ethnic groups. Generally speaking, our policy of mutual equality and respect among ethnic groups is successful. At present, although there are some problems in a few ethnic minority areas, the political situation in most ethnic minority areas is stable, and their economy and culture are continuously developing, and some areas are developing quite rapidly. Of course, due to historical and realistic reasons, there will still be factual inequalities among ethnic groups for a considerable period. In early this year, Tibet experienced unrest, mainly because the Dalai clique intensified their activities to split the motherland abroad, and there were a few separatist elements within Tibet advocating so-called "Tibet independence." Any attempt to split Tibet from the motherland is unacceptable to all ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people, and is doomed to fail. Now, the situation in Tibet is not deteriorating but gradually stabilizing, and social order has basically returned to normal.

Q: In Hong Kong, after the "June 4th Incident," there is a sense of distrust towards the Chinese government. To change this situation, what measures will the Chinese government take to restore Hong Kong's trust in China?

A: We have already noticed the situation you mentioned. The production of this situation is of course inseparable from the erroneous reports of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas about China's turmoil and riots, and even the large-scale spread of rumors and incitement. I believe that as the truth about China's suppression of turmoil and riots becomes known to the world, and as China's political situation stabilizes and the economy develops, the mentality of Hong Kong compatriots will gradually return to balance, and their trust in the central government will gradually recover. I am full of confidence in this. On the Hong Kong issue, the central government's policy of "one country, two systems" will not change, and we will not allow anyone to use any excuse not to implement the agreement between the Chinese and British governments on the Hong Kong issue. We will not forcibly change the existing social system in Hong Kong, and at the same time, we will not allow anyone to attempt to turn Hong Kong into a base for subverting the central government. "Mutual non-interference" should be a principle that we all follow. During the transitional period before Hong Kong's return to the motherland and after its return, we will continue to work hard to ensure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong people should also understand this point, that the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong cannot be separated from the prosperity and stability of the mainland. Without the mainland as a support, Hong Kong cannot prosper. Therefore, Hong Kong people should also support the central government in maintaining political stability. Any turmoil in the mainland will ultimately not be in the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong people.

Q: Now, there are some political changes in Eastern Europe, especially in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, there is the Solidarity Union. Will China allow workers to spontaneously organize trade unions in the future?

A: We are paying close attention to the recent situation in Poland and Hungary, but we will always adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs in handling relations with other communist parties and socialist countries. We believe that the parties and people of each socialist country will ultimately find the correct path to adhere to socialism based on their own national conditions. In our country, we will not allow opposition parties and opposition parties that are out of the leadership of the Communist Party to emerge. Trade unions in our country are mass organizations of the broad working class led by the Communist Party of China. They operate under the leadership of the Party while safeguarding the interests of the working class, and work independently and autonomously. During this turmoil and riot, "Worker's Autonomous Federation" and other illegal worker organizations appeared in Beijing and some other cities, whose main members were a few illegal elements who instigated the turmoil and even the riot, and were quickly disbanded and supported by the broad masses of workers. In the recent turmoil, the ranks of the working class in our country, especially the industrial workers, were stable and firmly supported the leadership of the Communist Party and the maintenance of the socialist system.

Q: In the future, in the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, what are China's expectations for Japan in terms of economy, trade, technology, and capital cooperation?

A: Since the restoration of diplomatic relations, the development of relations between China and Japan has been generally normal and smooth according to the joint statement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries. China has always attached great importance to relations with Japan. We are neighboring countries separated by a narrow strip of water and hope to be friendly with each other for generations to come. During the recent turmoil, the Japanese side also did some things that hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. Of course, we have also noticed that the official attitude of Japan is different from that of some Western powers, such as the United States. I personally hope that this is just a brief interlude in the long-term friendly relations between China and Japan. If we talk about expectations, I also hope that the Japanese side will work to further reduce China's trade deficit, import more Chinese products that are suitable for the Japanese market, and ease the transfer of technology to China, and ensure that the agreements reached in the field of capital cooperation are continued to be implemented.

When it comes to the issue of some foreign governments currently supporting and indulging in the activities of rioters wanted by the Chinese government on their soil to oppose the Chinese government, Yuan Mu expressed strong opposition to their actions. He hoped that all governments harboring rioters wanted by China would respect Chinese law, abide by international legal norms, and properly and correctly handle this issue. At the same time, he said that we have also noticed that the activities of these rioters who have fled abroad are now gradually being restricted by certain parties. For example, in their recent so-called "100th anniversary of the Tiananmen Incident" activities, due to various reasons, they have not been able to achieve their expected goals and scale. Here, the most basic fact and the decisive factor is that China, led by the Communist Party of China, with 1.1 billion people, is stable, and the Chinese government is able to control the situation. More and more people have come to realize this, realizing that they still have to deal with China led by the Communist Party. Any attempt to isolate China is impossible and is very unfavorable to those who try to do so.

Finally, the Japanese reporters expressed their sincere wish for greater achievements in China's socialist construction. Yuan Mu thanked them and asked them to convey his greetings to the Japanese readers.

　　袁木答日本《产经新闻》记者问
　　谈国外舆论界关注的有关中国政治经济形势问题
    新华社北京9月17日电　据《经济日报》记者报道，国务院发言人袁木9月16日接受应《经济日报》邀请来华采访的日本《产经新闻》记者组的访问，回答了他们提出的、国外舆论界感兴趣的有关中国政治经济形势的一些问题。
    问：在中华人民共和国成立40周年之际来到中国采访，我们感到中国40年来取得的成就是非常伟大的，虽然在这个过程中也发生过一些挫折。
  “6·4事件”以后中国将向何处发展？这是日本人民很关心的问题。
    答：我国领导人在不久前发生的风波之后曾多次讲过，我国既定的奋斗目标和基本政策不会变。总的方向还是要实现社会主义现代化，还是要执行以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放的基本路线。西方有些国家总是说我国平暴以后政策变了，这是他们的误解，或者说他们对我国的改革开放本来就理解得不那么正确，误以为中国的改革开放在经济上就是要搞私有化，在政治上要搞多元化，文化上要完全西化。我们决不会走这条路。我们既定的方针不会变，实现社会主义现代化的方向不会变。
    我国经济发展的战略部署还是分三步走。第一步从1980年算起，实现国民生产总值翻一番，基本解决人民的温饱问题，这个目标已经实现。第二步，到本世纪末国民生产总值再翻一番，人民生活达到小康水平，现在我们正为实现这个目标而努力，虽然还会遇到不少的困难，但这个目标的实现是有把握的。第三步是再花50年左右的时间，人均国民生产总值达到中等发达国家的水平。
    在外交方面，我们仍然坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。我们将立足于维护我国人民和世界人民的根本利益，独立自主地处理国际关系和我国与其他国家之间的双边关系，决不受任何外来势力的干扰。我们还要为维护世界和平和反对霸权主义而继续努力。我们将坚持两条：一条是努力在和平共处五项原则的基础上，致力于建立国际政治新秩序；一条是在平等互利的基础上，努力发展同其他国家的经济关系，致力于建立国际经济新秩序。
    问：去年9月我曾来过中国，现在又来到中国，在经过天安门时看到了戒严部队的战士。我们现在非常关心的一个问题是戒严何时能解除？
    答：我先要向你解释一下中国在北京部分地区实行戒严的含义。我不知道“戒严”这个词在日文中是如何翻译的，它在英文中被翻译成为“martial law”，这个翻译不能准确地反映我们实行戒严的含义。martial
  law一般有军管的含义。军管往往是政府失去了控制政局的能力，因此由军队来控制局势。我们现在是中央人民政府即国务院根据宪法赋予的权力，在北京市的部分地区实行戒严。人民解放军根据政府的命令执行戒严任务，即对某些重要机关和交通要道实行警戒。它并不干预任何国家事务和社会经济生活等，只是起维护社会秩序的作用。实行戒严以后，结束了3个月前的混乱局面，现在首都秩序已基本恢复正常。首都的稳定促进了全国的稳定。首都部分地区继续实行戒严一段时间，是保证首都和全国稳定的一个重要因素。
　　现在戒严尚未取消，主要原因一是极少数暴乱分子尚未全部缉拿归案并依法得到应有的处置，一是前个时期被暴乱分子抢去的枪支还有少部分散失在社会上，还没有全部收缴回来。现在戒严已经逐步放宽，岗哨在减少，广大群众已经可以有组织地到天安门广场参观、活动。首都人民各方面生活是正常的。当然，戒严肯定是有限期的，但目前还要维持一段时间。
    附带说一句，有的西方国家以中国取消戒严为先决条件，提出什么不取消戒严就不同中国交往，这是对我国内部事务的干涉。这种主张是我们所绝对不能接受的。实际上，继续实行一段时间的戒严，并不影响我们同国外的交往，你们来我国采访不是就没有受到什么影响吗！
    问：中国共产党前总书记赵紫阳现在做些什么？今后将对他如何处理？
    答：赵紫阳同志犯了在党内支持动乱和分裂党
  的严重错误。他的问题到目前为止还是党内问题。在今年6月召开的中国共产党十三届四中全会上，根据党章，根据民主程序，经过全体中央委员讨论并一致通过决议，撤销了他的总书记、政治局常委、政治局委员和中央委员的职务。对他的问题，我们党还在继续审查。今后如何处理，将以他的错误事
  实为依据。
    问：现在赵紫阳先生在什么地方居住？他的日
  常生活是否自由？
    答：他的日常生活是自由的，而且原来的生活待遇并没有变。他还住在北京。
    问：中央军委主席邓小平先生身体是否健康？
  现在西方有些报道是关于邓小平先生健康的，国庆
  节邓小平先生是否会露面？
    答：我可以告诉你，邓小平同志身体非常好，很健康。今天（16日）晚上你们就可以从电视中看
  到他的风采。如果我们的会见改在明天，这个问题
  你们肯定就不会提了。西方和港、台的某些新闻媒
  介老是在邓小平同志的健康问题上作文章，制造谣
  言，实在很卑劣和令人厌恶。
    问：中国经济发展中存在着地区发展不平衡的问题，沿海和内地发展不平衡，对此你有何看法？
    答：中国国家很大，地区之间存在着相当严重的经济发展不平衡问题，这是个客观事实。中国经过这10年来的努力，11亿人口的温饱问题从总体上
  已基本得到解决，这是一个很大的成绩。但是到目前为止，大概还有几千万人口的地区，温饱问题还没有得到解决。这些地区我们通常叫“老、少、边”地区，即自然条件比较差的老革命根据地、少数民族地区和边远地区。这些地区比起沿海和内地一些经济比较发达的地区，差距很大。现在我们的方针是，对沿海地区还是要继续支持它们发展，并尽量鼓励它们根据实际可能把原料和市场放到国外，发展外向型经济。同时，鼓励沿海和内地进行经济协作，用沿海的资金、技术和人才支持内地发展，争取把差距逐步缩小。当然这需要一定的时间，短时期内还难以做到。实行这样的政策，有些资源比较丰富的内地，情况正在发生较大的变化。比如山西，由于同沿海地区实行经济协作，煤炭资源的开发比过
  去加快，省里的经济情况比过去好得多了。对于一部
  分条件很差的贫困地区，资源又很贫乏，国家还拨了专项的扶贫资金，用于支持这些地区的经济发展。
    问：中国将继续坚持改革开放，对这一点我们
  已经充分理解。现在中国正在进行治理整顿，这对
  中国农业、乡镇企业和个体经济的发展前景将产生
  什么影响？
    答：治理整顿的中心问题是抑制通货膨胀，逐步缓解由于前几年经济过热造成的社会总需求大于
  总供给的矛盾。目前我们正在进一步研究和制定治理整顿的总体计划，进一步明确经济调整的目标、时间、步骤和政策措施。调整经济的一个重要问题就是要逐步解决农业徘徊问题，努力把农业搞上去。我们还要在努力保持总量大体平衡的前提下，通过合理调整产业结构和投资结构，实行倾斜政策，向农业和基础工业、基础设施倾斜，对加工工业的发展规模和速度加以适当控制。物价结构也要进行相应的调整。要进一步适当提高农产品主要是粮食、棉花等的价格，适当提高能源和某些重要原材料的价格，以支持农业和能源、原材料工业的发展。对乡镇企业，我们的方针可以概括为这么几句话，发展速度要适当降低，产业结构要合理调整，技术水平要进一步提高，经营管理和经营作风要认真改进。总的还是要发展，但要加以正确的引导。对个体经济，我们将在继续鼓励它们适当发展的同时，加强必要的宏观管理，以更好地发挥它们对公有制经济的必要的有益的补充作用。
    问：中国的交通费用为什么作了较大幅度地提高？农产品目前还有两种价格，调整价格的重点是不是国家价格，国家价格将放到何种程度？
    答：前不久我们提高了铁路、水路和航空的客运票价，货运价格没有动，预计这对整个物价水平的影响不会太大。我国交通运输业长期实行的是低运价政策，许多客运票价从50年代以来一直没有调整过，这同其他物价水平已不成比例，造成了交通运输业严重亏损，价格再不调整已难以为继。这次提高客运票价，将会有利于我国交通运输业的发展，对此我国人民是能够理解的。
    农产品价格的调整主要是逐步适当提高国家向农民实行合同订购的价格，当然这方面的价格仍将低于市场议价。中国农民有向国家积极交售粮食等农产品的义务，他们在完成合同订购任务之后，多余的粮食等还可以到市场上出售。两种价格的状况在短期内还不可能取消。
    问：现在苏联的民族问题是一个非常头疼的问题，中国对少数民族问题将采取什么样的政策措施？
    答：我们一贯坚持民族平等互助和尊重少数民族的政策。在少数民族聚居地区，根据宪法和法律，实行民族区域自治，坚决尊重和保护少数民族的区域自治权力。我们一贯尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，尊重他们的宗教信仰，保障他们使用自己民族的文字和语言，还提倡和鼓励多数民族主要是汉族帮助少数民族地区发展经济文化。新中国成立后，各少数民族地区都大量培养了本民族的干部。总的来看，我们实行的是各民族相互平等和相互尊重的政策是成功的。目前我国虽然也有个别少数民族地区有些麻烦，但绝大多数民族地区政局是稳定的，经济文化是持续发展的，有些地区的发展还相当快。当然，由于历史的和现实的种种原因，各民族间还将在相当长的时期内存在着事实上的不平等。西藏在今年初一度出现骚乱，主要是因为达赖一伙在国外加紧进行分裂祖国的活动，西藏内部也有极少数主张所谓“西藏独立”的分裂主义分子。任何妄想把西藏从祖国大家庭分裂出去的图谋都是全国各族人民包括西藏同胞所不能容许的，是注定要失败的。现在西藏局势不是恶化，而是逐渐趋于平稳，社会秩序已基本恢复正常。
    问：在香港，自“6·4”事件后对中国政府有一种不信任感。为了改变这种状况，中国政府将采取什么样的对策来使香港恢复对中国的信赖？
    答：我们早已经注意到了你刚才说的情况。这种情况的产生，当然同港、台和国外对我国动乱、暴乱的错误报道，乃至大量制造谣言、蛊惑人心是分不开的。我相信，随着我国制止动乱、平息暴乱的真相大白于天下，随着中国政局的稳定和经济的发展，香港同胞的心态终将逐步趋于平衡，对祖国政府的信赖终将逐步恢复。对此，我充满了信心。在香港问题上，我国政府提出的“一国两制”的方针决不变，也不容许以任何借口不执行中英两国政府关于香港问题的协议。我们绝不会强行改变香港的现行社会制度，同时我们也决不容许某些人妄图把香港变成颠覆中央人民政府的基地。“井水不犯河水”应该是我们都遵循的原则。在香港回归祖国的过渡期间和回归之后，我们都将不断努力保证香港的稳定和繁荣。我想，香港人也应当理解这样一点，香港的繁荣稳定离不开内地的繁荣稳定，没有内地作为依靠，香港也无法繁荣。所以，香港人也应该支持祖国政府保持政局的稳定。内地的任何动乱，归根到底也是不符合香港同胞的根本利益的。
  问：现在，东欧特别是波兰和匈牙利出现了一些政治变动，在波兰存在着团结工会，中国今后是否会允许工人自发地组织一些工会组织？
    答：我们对波兰和匈牙利最近的情况很关注，但我们在处理同其他共产主义政党和社会主义国家的关系问题上将始终遵循互不干涉内部事务的原则。我们相信，各个社会主义国家的党和人民终究会从自己国家的情况出发，找到符合各自国情的坚持社会主义的正确道路。在我们中国，将不允许出现摆脱共产党领导的反对派和反对党。我们国家的工会是中国共产党领导的广大职工的群众组织，它们在党的领导下活动，同时维护职工群众的利益，独立自主地进行工作。在这次动乱和暴乱过程中，北京和其他个别城市出现过“工自联”等非法的工人组织，其主要成员是极少数策动动乱乃至暴乱的非法分子，因而很快被取缔，并得到广大职工群众的拥护。在前不久的风波中，我国工人阶级特别是产业工人的队伍是稳定的，是坚决拥护共产党的领导和维护社会主义制度的。
    问：今后，在日中关系问题上，在经济、贸易、技术、资金合作等方面中国对日本有些什么样的期待？
    答：中日两国自从邦交恢复以来，根据两国联合声明和和平友好条约，双方关系的发展总的来说是正常的和顺利的。中国一贯重视同日本的关系。我们是一衣带水的邻国，希望能够世世代代友好下去。在不久前发生的风波期间，日本方面也做了一些有损于中国人民感情的事情。当然，我们还注意到，日本官方同西方有的大国比如美国的态度还是有所不同的。我个人希望这只是中日长期友好关系当中的一个短暂的插曲。要是说到期待，我还希望日方在两国贸易中为进一步缩小中方的逆差而努力，能够更多地进口一些适合日本市场需要的中国商品，并且放宽对中国的技术转让，同时使已经达成的有关资金合作方面的协议能够得到继续执行。
    当谈到有的外国政府目前还在支持与纵容被中国政府通缉的暴乱分子在其国土上进行种种反对中国政府活动的问题时，袁木表示坚决反对他们这样做。他希望所有收容被我国通缉的暴乱分子的所在政府，尊重中国法律，恪守国际法准则，妥善地正确地处理这个问题。同时他还说，我们也已经注意到，这些逃亡在国外的暴乱分子的种种活动，现在也逐步受到某些方面的限制。比如他们最近在所谓天安门事件“百日祭”的活动中，就因为种种原因而远未能达到他们预期的目的和规模。这里一个最基本的事实和起决定性作用的因素是，中国共产党领导的拥有11亿人民的中国是稳定的，中国政府是能够控制局势的。越来越多的有识之士已经认识到这一点，认识到他们还是要同中国共产党领导的中国打交道，任何孤立中国的企图都是不可能做到的，也是对企图这样做的人很不利的。
    最后，日本记者表示衷心祝愿中国的社会主义建设能取得更大成绩。袁木向他们表示感谢，并请他们代向日本读者致意。
