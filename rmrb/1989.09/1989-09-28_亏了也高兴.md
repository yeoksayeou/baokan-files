Lake North Province Guangshui City Baolin Township soft-shelled turtle farming specialist and Communist Party member Liu Chengyan said that this year's income from turtle farming might be reduced by 5,000 yuan compared to last year. When asked why, Old Liu smiled and replied, "Now that the anti-corruption campaign is being implemented seriously, public funds can't be used for extravagant banquets anymore. The price of soft-shelled turtles has dropped from over 20 yuan per pound last year to around 10 yuan now. My family has over 500 pounds of turtles ready for sale, so I'm going to lose over 5,000 yuan, right?"

Liu Chengyan started farming turtles in 1987. This year, he invested in purchasing turtle seedlings and building turtle ponds, but the price of turtles plummeted. His family is expected to incur a loss of over 3,000 yuan this year. Someone told him, "You've worked so hard for a year, and now you're losing so much money. Aren't you heartbroken?" He replied, "I've become wealthy thanks to the Party's policies. Now the central government is determined to promote anti-corruption and genuinely govern the country. If the country does well, my small family will be even richer. What's there to fear about temporary difficulties? Losing 3,000 yuan, but my heart is happy!"

    “亏了也高兴”
    吴克勤
    湖北省广水市宝林乡养鳖专业户、共产党员刘成彦说，今年养鳖收入可能要比去年减少五千元。有人问及原因，老刘笑着回答：“如今廉政建设动真格的，不兴用公款大吃大喝了，甲鱼（鳖）价从去年的二十多元一斤降到十元左右，我家待售的五百多斤甲鱼，不是要少卖五千多元吗？”
    刘成彦从一九八七年开始养鳖，今年他投资购买种鳖，修建鳖池，可鳖价大跌，他家今年要拉下三千多元亏空。有人对他说：“你辛辛苦苦干了一年，还亏了这么多，不心疼吗？”他却说：“我是靠党的政策富起来的，如今中央下决心搞廉政建设，真心实意治理国家，国家搞好了，我的小家就会更富裕，暂时的困难怕什么？亏了三千元，心里也高兴！”
