Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 6th.

A rich variety of folk arts has brought this year's Lhasa Shoton Festival to a climax.

The Shoton Festival is a traditional summer and autumn festival where people eat yogurt and watch Tibetan opera. It has evolved into a large-scale comprehensive arts festival centered around Tibetan opera. This year's performances include Tibetan traditional arts such as Gesar storytelling, Togla, Lhamo, six-stringed lute singing, storytelling, and folktales. There are also performances of crosstalk, quick-talk, and comedic dramas from other parts of the country. Except for the comedic dramas, all the other performances are in the Tibetan language.
