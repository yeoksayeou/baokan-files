    Clever Scheme to Make Money
    Selling Old Parts as New to Cheat Customers

    Over the past 10 years, the American company Rice Aircraft has been selling counterfeit old aircraft parts to major airlines and aircraft manufacturers around the world.

    Recently, the company's chairman, Bruce Rice, admitted in court that his company had sold refurbished old aircraft parts as new to the French aerospace company, British Aerospace, Grumman Aircraft Corporation, American Airlines, Pan American World Airways, United Airlines, and Air France, among others. The company also sold these counterfeit parts to government departments in the United States and Israel. As a result, these old parts were installed on military aircraft such as the F-14 fighter jets and B-1B bombers.

    An official from the U.S. government, responsible for investigating the case, said that this incident has raised doubts about the reliability and safety of many aircraft. However, there is currently no evidence that the use of these parts has caused any accidents.

    According to the charges, Rice could face up to 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, in addition to paying $250,000 in legal fees and $1 million in compensation.

    财迷心窍出绝招
    以旧充新坑顾客
    美国赖斯飞机公司在过去10年中，一直向世界上一些主要航空公司和飞机制造厂出售冒牌的旧飞机零件。
    该公司董事长布鲁斯·赖斯前不久在法庭上承认，他的公司把修理后的旧飞机零部件假冒成新零部件卖给了法国空中公共汽车工业财团、英国航空和航天公司、格鲁曼飞机公司、美国航空公司、泛美航空公司、联合航空公司和法国航空公司等飞机制造厂和航空公司。该公司还将冒牌零件卖给了美国和以色列政府部门。结果这些旧零件被安装到了F—14战斗机和B—1B轰炸机等军用飞机上。
    美国政府负责调查此案的官员说，此案使人们对许多飞机的可靠性和安全性产生了疑问。但目前还未找到因使用这些零部件而造成事故的证据。
    按罪行，赖斯可能被判处5年监禁和25万美元罚款，另外还需支付25万美元的诉讼费和100万美元的赔款。
