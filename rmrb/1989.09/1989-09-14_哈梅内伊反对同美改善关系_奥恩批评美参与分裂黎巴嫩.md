    Khamenei Opposes Improving Relations with the US

    Aoun Criticizes US Involvement in Lebanon's Division

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, September 13th: Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei today delivered a speech criticizing those "intellectuals" who proposed establishing good relations with the United States.

    According to Iranian radio broadcasts, Khamenei said during a meeting with local visitors that those who want Iran to develop relations with Washington actually know nothing about the reality, and only the common people understand the true situation.

    He said that since the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution expelled the United States, the United States has consistently taken a hostile and antagonistic stance towards Iran.

    During the meeting, when Khamenei warned the United States, the "Great Satan," not to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, the visitors shouted slogans such as "Down with the United States, Down with Israel."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 12th: Lebanese Christian militia leader Michel Aoun recently criticized the United States in an interview with the French newspaper "Libération" for plotting to divide Lebanon into two parts controlled by Syria and Israel.

    Aoun, when discussing the U.S. withdrawal of its embassy from Lebanon on September 6th, pointed out that he has no expectations for the United States.

    When discussing the ceasefire issue, Aoun said that Syria's lifting of the blockade on the Lebanese Christian-controlled port and the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, at least partial withdrawal, are "preconditions" for negotiations.

　　哈梅内伊反对同美改善关系
　　奥恩批评美参与分裂黎巴嫩
    据新华社德黑兰9月13日电　伊朗最高领导人哈梅内伊今天发表讲话，批评那些“有知识的人”提出的同美国建立良好关系的要求。
    据伊朗电台广播，哈梅内伊在接见一批当地来访者时说，那些想要伊朗同华盛顿发展关系的人，实际上对现实一无所知，只有普通大众才了解真实形势。
    他说，自1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命将美国驱逐以来，美国一直对伊朗采取敌对和仇视立场。
    在接见过程中，当哈梅内伊警告美国这个“大撒旦”不要干涉别国内政时，来访者高喊起“打倒美国，打倒以色列”的口号。
    新华社巴黎9月12日电　黎巴嫩基督教军政府首脑米歇尔·奥恩最近在接受法国《解放报》记者采访时批评美国阴谋把黎巴嫩分裂成受叙利亚和以色列控制的两部分。
    奥恩在谈到美国于本月6日撤走其驻黎巴嫩使馆一事时指出，他对美国没有什么指望。
    在谈到停火问题时，奥恩说，叙利亚取消对黎巴嫩基督教派控制的港口的封锁以及从黎巴嫩撤走军队，至少部分撤军是进行谈判的“先决条件”。
