Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 18th.

Tianjin municipal leaders have gone to the grassroots to seek advice from the masses and address their grievances, achieving good results.

Since 1987, Tianjin has made it a tradition to conduct heart-to-heart talks with the masses as a way to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the people and improve leadership styles. This time, a month-long series of talks has been arranged, and in the first 10 days, 29 municipal leaders have visited grassroots units 55 times, with the following characteristics:

- Special attention has been paid to relying on the working class with enthusiasm, and efforts have been made to revitalize large and medium-sized enterprises. Municipal leaders Tan Shaowen, Nie Bixiu, and Zhang Lichang first went to the Tianjin Petrochemical Company, a large modern enterprise, to listen to suggestions and solve problems.
- The masses' awareness of participating in politics has increased, and many workers in various units have shifted from "demanding solutions to personal problems" to "offering advice for common causes."
- Leaders have been educated at the grassroots level. Municipal Party Committee Deputy Secretary Liu Jinfeng and Vice Mayor Zhang Lichang visited the remote areas of Ji County and the eastern breakwater of Tianjin Port, respectively, and were moved by the excellent achievements created by the local people under harsh conditions. They discussed further development in various ways.

　  向群众问计求教　为基层排忧解难
　　天津市领导下去和群众谈心
    本报天津9月18日电　记者肖荻报道：天津市委、市政府主要负责同志深入基层向群众问计求教，为群众排忧解难，收到良好效果。
    自1987年开展谈心服务活动以来，已经成为天津市密切党群关系、改进领导作风的“传统节目”。这次安排一个月的谈心活动，10天来已有29位市级领导同志55次深入到基层单位，有以下几个特点：
    ——特别注意满腔热情地依靠工人阶级，下功夫搞活大中型企业。市主要领导人谭绍文、聂璧初、张立昌等首先到大型现代化企业天津石化公司听取建议，解决难题。
    ——群众参政意识增强，许多单位职工变“要求解决个人难题”为“为共同事业献计献策”。
    ——领导在基层受到教育。市委副书记刘晋峰、副市长张立昌分别到蓟县山区、天津港东突堤等边远地区，被那里的群众在艰苦条件下所创的优异成绩所感动，就进一步开发作了多方探讨。
