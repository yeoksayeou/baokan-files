According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan, reporter Chen Hui learned from the recent Shanxi Provincial National Defense Education Experience Exchange Conference that Shanxi Province's national defense education has entered a scientific and legalized track, and a national defense education system with patriotism as its main theme has been established.

Shanxi Province began its national defense education in early 1985 across the entire province. The main content of the education is to instill the spirit of national defense, national defense obligations, and national defense knowledge with patriotism as the core throughout society. They use militia training bases, "National Defense Education Clubs," schools, and other units as the core, conduct education in a hierarchical and systematic manner, gradually achieve the networkization of education organizations, systematization of education content, diversification of education forms, socialization of education objects, and institutionalization of education activities. Currently, the province has established a National Defense Education Committee and set up a number of national defense education leadership groups, offices, and demonstration points, with over 556,000 people receiving education. The province has over 2,000 county-level and above leaders who have received relatively systematic national defense education training.

Shanxi Province is the first provincial-level unit in the country to implement national defense education legislation. The Provincial People's Congress approved the "Provisional Regulations on National Defense Education in Shanxi Province" in March this year. The provincial government issued administrative regulations such as the "Trial Measures for the Preferential Treatment and Placement of Serving Youth Workers" and the "Provisional Regulations on the Preferential Treatment of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Veterans, and Disabled Veterans." Localities, counties, and townships have also formulated local regulations for conducting national defense education.

National defense education has promoted patriotism and military support spirit throughout the province, stabilized society, promoted production, and strengthened the construction of "two civilizations." During this year's recruitment period, 430,000 eligible young people in the province signed up to enlist, with a signup rate of over 95%.

Representatives from various military regions, the navy, air force, and the five provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in North China, as well as leaders from the Central Propaganda Department and the General Staff Department and General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, attended the experience exchange conference.

    弘扬爱国主义  开展拥军习武活动
    山西形成国防教育体系
    据新华社太原电　（记者陈辉）记者从最近召开的山西省国防教育经验交流会上获悉：山西省的全民国防教育走上了科学化、法制化的轨道，一个以爱国主义为主旋律的全民国防教育体系已经形成。
    山西省的国防教育是从1985年初起在全省展开的。教育内容主要是向全社会灌注以爱国主义为核心的国防精神、国防义务和国防知识。他们以民兵训练基地、“国防教育俱乐部”、学校等单位为轴心，分层次、按系统进行，逐步实现教育组织网络化，教育内容系统化，教育形式多样化，教育对象社会化，教育活动制度化。目前，全省已成立了国防教育委员会，并设立了一批国防教育领导小组、办事机构和教育示范点，受教育者达55.6万余人。全省有2000多名县以上领导干部受过较系统的国防教育培训。
    山西省是全国第一个实行国防教育立法的省级单位。省人大今年3月审议通过了《山西省国防教育暂行条例》。省政府颁发了《优待和安置服役青工试行办法》、《优待烈军属、残废军人暂行规定》等行政性法规。各地、县、乡也制定了开展国防教育的乡规民约。
    国防教育使爱国、爱军精神在全省得到弘扬，稳定了社会，促进了生产，加强了“两个文明”建设。今年征兵期间，全省43万适龄青年报名应征，报名率达95％以上。
    各大军区、海空军和华北地区5省、市、自治区的代表，以及中宣部和解放军总参谋部、总政治部的领导同志出席了经验交流会。
