In the spring and summer of 1989, a severe political storm swept across China, and the Chinese Communists underwent a trial by stormy seas. Through this baptism of blood and fire, we further recognized a truth: in China, how important it is to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, how important it is to defend the ideological and theoretical front of Marxism, and how important it is to arm the entire Party, especially its cadres, with Marxism! This recognition, bought with blood, should be integrated into our Party's ideological and political work in the future, and also into the Party's ideological and theoretical education, including Party school education.

For many years, there has been a contentious issue in the teaching guidelines of Party schools: what should be the main course in Party schools? Should it be the basic principles of Marxism, or various knowledge-based courses, or a mix of both? This leads to another question: what exactly is the mission of Party schools? Is it to primarily enhance the political and theoretical qualities of Party members and cadres, or to mainly impart certain knowledge and conduct some professional training? Of course, enhancing the political and theoretical qualities of Party members and cadres also requires the transmission of knowledge. This is reflected in the fact that the teaching of Marxist principles should include a considerable amount of knowledge content, and that in addition to the principles courses, some knowledge-based courses should also be offered. However, it must be clear that the primary mission of Party schools is to enhance the political and theoretical qualities of Party members and cadres.

Some comrades say that our intermediate and senior cadres generally have studied the basic principles of Marxism, and what they lack most is modern knowledge. Learning more modern knowledge to advance to a new level in terms of knowledge is what they eagerly hope for. This statement is not entirely without merit, but it is not comprehensive. For an intermediate or senior leader, it is indeed necessary to understand some modern knowledge, which can help them broaden their horizons and improve their work level. However, what is particularly important for them is to truly master the theoretical weapons of Marxism and learn to analyze and solve problems using the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. Besides, learning modern knowledge can be done through other channels and does not necessarily have to be done at Party schools. Party schools also find it difficult to fully meet the demands of students in this regard.

The basic line of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee has been proven correct through practice. After establishing a correct line, the key lies in the cadres, in whether there is a group of Party members and cadres who truly understand Marxist theory and are politically firm to implement it.

As early as the revolutionary war years, Comrade Mao Zedong once said that if our Party had one hundred cadres who were proficient in Marxism, we would be able to win the revolution. Of course, for a ruling party leading 1.1 billion people, having only one hundred cadres proficient in Marxism is not enough today; more such cadres are needed. However, the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's words is still applicable today. In recent years, in combining the two basic points of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and adhering to reform and opening up, mistakes have often been made, especially the situation of "one hand soft and one hand hard" as mentioned by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. The fundamental reason lies in the highest leadership of the Party, but if we calmly reflect, is it not related to the fact that our intermediate and senior leaders have insufficient theoretical level and weak discernment? We can summarize the situation in the departments and regions under our jurisdiction regarding the implementation of the Party's basic line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee: is it fully and strictly implemented, or is there a significant deviation? If it is the latter, apart from other reasons, is it not also related to our own political and theoretical qualities? In the recent serious political turmoil, the importance of the political and theoretical qualities of intermediate and senior cadres can also be seen. In the development of the situation from the student movement to turmoil and then to counter-revolutionary rioting, for a considerable period, the voice of the Party Central Committee was not heard, or two different voices were heard, causing many comrades to fall into confusion. In such a situation, can one make an independent judgment, and what kind of judgment to make, is a severe test for every Party member, especially Party leaders. Some comrades, in the early stages of the event, were somewhat confused in their understanding due to lack of information, which is not a matter of political and theoretical qualities. However, there are indeed some people who did not pass this test, not because they lacked modern knowledge, but because their political and theoretical level was not high, and thus they lost their way in the face of this major issue of right and wrong. This lesson is worth our deep reflection. From the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee to the present decade of storms and rains, and from the political turmoil of April to June this year, we have become even more firm in this recognition: leading cadres must strengthen the study of Marxist theory and improve their own political and theoretical qualities; various levels of Party schools must regard improving the political and theoretical qualities of Party members and cadres as their main task.

In recent years, there has been much discussion within and outside the Party about the issue of Party style. The call to punish corruption has become a strong voice in society. Comrade Chen Yun reminded us: the issue of Party style is related to the life and death of a ruling party. It is natural that the issue of Party style has attracted widespread attention. Our Party is taking corresponding measures to seriously address this problem. However, I believe that in the construction of the Party, ideological and theoretical construction is also an issue that cannot be ignored, an issue related to whether the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee can be correctly implemented, whether the Four Cardinal Principles can be fully upheld, and whether reform and opening up can be smoothly promoted. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that although ideological and theoretical construction occupies an important position in the construction of the Party, it has not been given due attention by the Party's main leaders for a long time. During the period when Comrade Zhao Ziyang was the General Secretary, the ideological and theoretical construction of the Party was completely ignored. Not only that, but in the face of the relentless advance of bourgeois liberalization, concessions were made step by step, to the extent that some important ideological and theoretical positions of the Party were occupied by those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance, while comrades who uphold Marxist principles often face exclusion and have no platform to express their views. The weakness, concession, indulgence, and tolerance towards bourgeois liberalization are the ideological roots of this turmoil and riot. We should seriously summarize the lessons and prevent similar situations from recurring.

Strengthening the construction of Party schools is an important aspect of strengthening the ideological and theoretical construction of the Party. Comrades working in Party schools have keenly felt in recent years that Party school education has not received the attention it deserves. The teaching policy of the Party school system, which takes Marxist principles as the main course, often faces criticism from some people, while various job training and professional training centers are favored in society. Of course, job training and professional training are also necessary, but they cannot replace Party school training. It is not correct to think that only job training and professional training are in line with the requirements of modernization and reform and opening up, while Party school education with Marxist principles as the main course seems outdated and backward, not in line with the so-called trend of the 1980s. If we calmly analyze the actual situation of the cadre team, we will not have such a view.

In recent years, there has been a significant change in our cadre policy, which is to emphasize the reasonable structure of cadres' cultural quality and age, which is the well-known "four modernizations" of cadres: youth, knowledge, specialization, and later added revolutionization. Emphasizing the reasonable age structure and cultural quality is meaningful. However, while emphasizing youth, knowledge, and specialization, we have not emphasized the political and theoretical qualities of cadres enough, resulting in a situation where the cultural quality of cadres has improved while their political and theoretical qualities have declined. This contrast is quite significant. When selecting cadres, we place cultural level in an important position, which is necessary. However, there have been some biases, that is, the requirements for the political and theoretical qualities of cadres are not strict or high, resulting in some cadres taking up leadership positions whose political and theoretical qualities do not match their positions. This is not only the case at the grassroots level and below the county level, but also includes some provincial and municipal leaders. Some provincial and departmental leaders studying at the Central Party School feel that their current political and theoretical level does not match their positions. We should clearly see that some of our intermediate and senior cadres have not completely broken away from the type of experiential cadres. Not only do cadres with low cultural level have the possibility of becoming experiential cadres, but cadres with high cultural level, if their theoretical quality is poor, can also become experiential cadres. If this problem is not solved, it will affect our work, affect the implementation of the correct decisions of the Central Committee, and affect our entire cause. Therefore, emphasizing that leading cadres must study Marxist theory should not be seen as a temporary measure, but as a strategic task of the Party. Various levels of Party schools should not be seen as dispensable institutions or temporary training institutions, but as important departments for achieving the Party's above-mentioned strategic tasks.

In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the teaching situation of Party schools. Whether it is the students, the teachers, the general cadres of the Party school, or the leaders, there is a general dissatisfaction with the current teaching situation of the Party school. The way out for Party schools lies in reform. Only through reform can Party schools enhance their attractiveness and cohesion, which has become the consensus of many comrades. However, there are quite different opinions on how to reform. Some comrades advocate reducing Marxist principles courses and increasing various new knowledge courses. It seems that in this way, the teaching of Party schools will have vitality, the image of Party schools will change, and Party schools will be able to get out of the trough and get out of the predicament. I do not oppose the addition of some new knowledge courses, nor do I oppose some comrades' attempts and explorations in this regard. However, I believe that the focus of the reform of Party school teaching should not be placed here, but on using the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to study new situations and solve new problems. In other words, it is to combine Marxist theory with the current reality for new explorations. Since it is a reform, of course, innovation is needed, but the starting point of innovation should be to innovate Marxism, not to deviate from the main course of Marxism to do other things. We can imagine that if we do not work hard in theory combined with practice, do not combine Marxist theory with the line, policies, and actual situation of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and do not conduct creative research, but focus our energy on opening courses such as talentology, leadership science, decision-making science, and other so-called new courses, can we inject new vitality into the teaching of Party schools? Can we change the image of Party schools? Can Party schools get out of the trough and get out of the predicament? No. This has been fully proven by the practice of recent years. In recent years, many students have learned some so-called new courses, and after the initial novelty wears off, they often feel that these courses have little practical significance for improving their worldview, methodology, and problem-solving abilities. Looking back, they feel that studying Marxist theory, especially Marxist philosophy, has benefited them greatly.

The main course of Party schools is the principles of Marxism, but the principles of Marxism courses cannot always repeat what the old ancestors said a hundred years ago or several decades ago. The most precious aspect of Marxism lies in its revolutionary and critical spirit. It not only uses this spirit to deal with everything, but also uses this spirit to deal with all theories, including itself. Constant development and innovation are the source of the vitality of Marxism. China is conducting socialist revolution and construction under historical conditions and social environments completely different from those envisioned by Marx and Engels. The problems China encounters in its progress often cannot be found in the classic works of Marxism, and we need to use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze China's national conditions and draw our own conclusions. The view of denying the universal guiding significance of Marxism by using the excuse that China has its own national conditions, or the view of believing that Marxism is outdated by using the excuse that it is now the 1980s, are both wrong and manifestations of bourgeois liberalization. But if Marxism is solidified and not studied for new situations and new problems, and Marxism is treated with a dogmatic attitude, it is also wrong. In this regard, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is our model. On the one hand, he clearly proposed adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization; on the other hand, he proposed building socialism with Chinese characteristics and became the chief architect of China's reform and opening-up policy. Under his advocacy, our Party has explored a series of new problems raised by practice since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, such as the problem of the primary stage of socialism, the problem of planned commodity economy, the problem of ownership in the current stage, the problem of the criterion of productivity, and so on. The research on these problems not only has great theoretical significance but also has great practical significance. In addition to these problems that need to be further studied, there are many other problems worth studying. For example, the problem of how the socialist system realizes its self-improvement mechanism is a major theoretical problem. If it is well solved, it will have guiding significance for the further development of socialism. It is undeniable that almost all socialist countries, including the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China, have not solved this problem well. If this problem is not solved, it will be difficult to fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and difficult to make the socialist system have a strong attractiveness and cohesion. Again, the problem of social justice should also be noted. Socialism has eliminated the system of man exploiting man and achieved the greatest social justice, but due to the low level of productivity in the primary stage of socialism, various forms of ownership and distribution are inevitably present, and social injustice in the form of unfair distribution of interests is also inevitably present. This problem must be solved. If it is not solved, it may become a factor of social instability. In addition, many new situations have also emerged internationally since the end of World War II, and the rapid development of science and technology has also raised many new problems, all of which need to be studied. In short, there are many problems that need to be studied, and this is the time for theorists to show their mettle. The Party school system has done a lot of work in the past few years in combining theory with practice and in creatively studying Marxist theory, achieving certain results, but it is still far from the requirements of the Party, far from the requirements of the majority of students, and far from the role that Party schools should play. We should redouble our efforts, work hard in combining theory with practice, and work hard in innovating the main course of Marxist principles. We should implement the reform of Party school teaching and raise the teaching level of Party schools to a new height, and strive to better fulfill the glorious task of training intermediate and senior cadres entrusted to us by the Central Committee of the Party!

    用马克思主义武装党员干部是党的一项战略任务
    邢贲思
    1989年的春夏之交，中国的大地上出现了一场严重的政治风暴，中国共产党人经历了一次惊涛骇浪的斗争考验。通过这次血和火的洗礼，我们进一步认清了一个真理：在中国，坚持四项基本原则是何等重要，坚持马克思主义思想理论阵地是何等重要，用马克思主义武装全党特别是党的干部是何等重要！这一用鲜血的代价换来的认识，应当贯穿到我们党今后的思想政治工作中去，也应当贯穿到党的思想理论教育包括党校教育中去。
    多年来，在党校的教学方针中一直存在着一个有争议的问题，这就是党校的主课应当是什么，是马克思主义的基本原理，还是各种知识性的课程，或是各自参半，平分秋色？这就涉及到另一个问题，党校的任务究竟是什么，是主要从政治上、理论上提高党员干部的素质，还是主要给党员干部传授某些知识，进行某种专业培训？当然，从政治上、理论上提高党员干部的素质，也离不开知识的传授。这既表现在马克思主义原理的讲授中应当包含相当容量的知识内容，也表现在除原理课之外，还需要开设一些知识性的课程。但是，党校的主要任务是从政治理论素质上提高党员干部，这一点必须明确。
    有同志说，我们的中高级干部一般都学过马克思主义基本原理，他们最缺乏的还是现代化的知识，多学一点现代化知识，在知识层面上踏上一个新的台阶，这是他们所急切盼望的。这种说法不能说没有一点道理，但不够全面。作为一个中高级领导干部，懂得一些现代化知识当然是需要的，这对他们开阔视野，提高工作水平是有帮助的。但对他们来说，尤其重要的是真正掌握马克思主义的理论武器，学会用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法分析问题，解决问题。何况，学习现代化知识可以通过别的渠道，不一定要到党校来学，党校也很难完全满足学员这方面的要求。
    十一届三中全会以来的党的基本路线经过实践检验是正确的。一条正确路线确立之后关键在于干部，在于有没有一批真正通晓马克思主义理论、政治坚定的党员干部来加以贯彻实施。
    早在革命战争年代，毛泽东同志曾经说过，如果我们党拥有一百位精通马克思主义的干部，我们就能赢得革命的胜利。当然，对于一个领导11亿人口的执政党来说，今天仅有一百位精通马克思主义的干部是不够了，需要更多这样的干部。但是毛泽东同志这番话的精神至今仍然适用。这些年来，在坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放这两个基本点的结合上经常出现失误，特别是出现邓小平同志所说的一手软一手硬的情况，根本的原因固然发生于党的最高领导层，但如果我们冷静地反思一下，是否和我们这些中高级领导干部理论水平不够高、识别能力不够强有关呢？我们可以总结一下，在我们管辖的部门和地区，贯彻十一届三中全会以来的党的基本路线的情况究竟如何，是全面地、不折不扣地加以贯彻呢，还是有相当的出入。如果是后一种情况，这除了其他原因之外，是否也和我们自己的政治理论素质有关呢？在最近发生的这场严重的政治风波中，同样可以看出中高级领导干部政治理论素质的重要性。在这次从学潮到动乱再到反革命暴乱的事态发展中，相当一段时间听不到党中央的声音，或者说是听到了两种不同的声音，使不少同志陷入困惑。在这种形势下能不能作出独立的判断，作出什么样的判断，对每一个党员，特别是党员领导干部都是严峻的考验。有些同志在事态发展的初期，由于不明真相在认识上有些模糊，这并非属于政治理论素质问题，但确实也有些人没有经得起这场考验，这并非因为他们缺乏现代化知识，而是由于他们政治理论水平不高，因而在这场大是大非面前迷失了方向。这个教训值得我们深思。从党的十一届三中全会到现在十年来的风风雨雨，从今年4月至6月的两个月的政治风波，使我们更加坚定了这样一个认识：领导干部必须加强马克思主义理论的学习，提高自身的政治理论素质；各级党校必须把提高党员干部的政治理论素质当作自己的主要任务。
    近年来，党内外对我们党的党风问题议论得很多，要求惩治腐败已成了社会各界的一个很强的声音。陈云同志告诫我们：执政党的党风问题关系到党的生死存亡。党风问题引起广泛的关注是理所当然的。我们党正在采取相应的措施来认真解决这一问题。但是，我认为在党的建设中，思想理论建设同样是一个不容忽视的问题，是一个关系到党的十一届三中全会路线能否正确贯彻，关系到四项基本原则能否全面坚持，改革开放能否顺利推进的重大问题。问题的严重性在于，思想理论建设虽在党的建设中占有重要地位，但长期以来却没有引起党的主要领导人的重视。在赵紫阳同志任总书记期间，更是完全忽视了党的思想理论建设。不仅如此，面对资产阶级自由化思潮的步步进逼而节节退让，以至党的一些重要思想理论阵地被一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人所霸占，而坚持马克思主义原则的同志却往往受到排斥，往往没有发表自己意见的园地。对资产阶级自由化的软弱、退让、姑息、纵容，是酿成这次动乱和暴乱的思想根源。对此，我们应当认真总结教训，避免类似的情况重新出现。
    加强党校建设是加强党的思想理论建设的一个重要方面。在党校工作的同志这些年来痛切地感到，党校教育没有受到应有的重视。党校系统以马克思主义原理为主课的教学方针经常受到一些人的责难，而名目繁多的岗位培训、专业培训中心在社会上却倍受青睐。当然，岗位培训、专业培训也是必要的，但它不能代替党校的培训。不能认为只有岗位培训、专业培训才是符合现代化建设要求、符合改革开放要求的，而以马克思主义原理为主课的党校教育似乎是过时的、落伍的，是不符合所谓80年代的时代潮流的。如果我们冷静地分析一下党员干部队伍的实际情况，就不会这样来看问题。
  这些年来，我们的干部政策有一个很大的转变，就是强调了干部的文化素质和年龄方面的合理结构，这就是大家都知道的干部的“四化”：年轻化、知识化、专业化，后来又加了一个革命化。强调年龄结构的合理，强调文化素质，这样一个干部政策上的转变是有意义的。但是，我们在强调年轻化、知识化、专业化的同时，对干部的政治理论素质强调得不够，因此出现了一个情况，就是干部的文化素质上去了，政治理论素质下来了。这个反差是相当大的。我们在选拔干部时把文化层次摆在一个重要的地位来考虑，这是必要的。但是也多少出现了一些偏颇，就是对干部的政治理论素质要求不严、不高，以至一部分干部走上领导岗位以后，政治理论素质和他所担任的职务不相称。这不仅是指基层，不仅是指县以下的单位，也包括部分省市领导。在中央党校学习的一些省的领导同志和部的领导同志，感到他们现在的政治理论水平同所担任的职务不相称。我们应当清醒地看到，我们的某些中高级领导干部并没有完全从经验型的干部类型摆脱出来。不仅是文化水平低的干部有可能成为经验型的干部，文化水平高的干部如果他的理论素质差，同样有可能成为经验型的干部。这个问题如果不解决，就会影响到我们的工作，影响到我们贯彻中央正确的决策，影响到我们的整个事业。因此，强调领导干部必须学习马克思主义理论，这不应当看成是一种权宜之计，而应当看成是党的一项战略任务。各级党校不应当被看作可有可无的机构，或者被看作临时培训性质的机构，而应当看成是实现党的上述战略任务的重要部门。
    这些年来，大家关于党校的教学状况谈论得也比较多。不论是学员，还是教员，不论是党校的一般干部，还是领导，普遍对党校的教学现状感到不满。党校的出路在于改革，只有经过改革，党校才能增强吸引力和凝聚力，这已成了很多同志的共识。但是，究竟怎样改革，在这个问题上意见相当分歧。有的同志主张减少马克思主义的原理课，增加各种新知识的课程。似乎这样一来，党校的教学就具有了活力，党校的面貌就会改变，党校就可以从此走出低谷、摆脱困境。我不反对增加一些新知识的课程，也不反对一些同志在这方面进行尝试和探索。但是，我认为党校教学改革的重点不应当放在这里，而应当放在运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去研究新情况，解决新问题。换句话说，就是要把马克思主义的理论同当前的实际结合起来进行新的探索。既然是改革，当然要创新，但创新的立足点应当是创马克思主义之新，而不是离开马克思主义的主课去另作他图。我们可以设想一下，如果我们不是在理论联系实际上下功夫，不是把马克思主义理论同十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策结合起来，同国内外的实际情况结合起来进行创造性的研究，而是把精力主要放在开设诸如人才学、领导学、决策学等所谓新的课程上，能为党校教学注入新的活力吗，能改变党校的面貌吗，能使党校走出低谷、摆脱困境吗？不能。这已为近年来的实践所充分证明。这些年来，不少学员学了一些所谓新的课程，在最初的新鲜感失去以后，往往感到这对他们的世界观、方法论水平的提高，对他们分析问题、解决问题的能力的提高并无多大实际意义。回过头来，他们感到学习马克思主义的理论，特别是学习马克思主义哲学使他们受益非浅。
    党校的主课是马克思主义原理，但马克思主义原理课不能老是重复一百多年前、几十年前老祖宗讲过的东西。马克思主义最可贵的地方在于它的革命批判精神，它不但以这种精神对待一切事物，也以这种精神对待一切理论，包括它自身。不断发展，不断创新，这就是马克思主义生命力之所在。中国是在马克思、恩格斯所设想的完全不同的历史条件和社会环境中进行社会主义革命和建设的。中国在前进中遇到的问题往往在马克思主义的经典著作中找不到现成的答案，需要我们运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法分析我国国情，得出自己的结论。借口中国有自己的国情来否定马克思主义的普遍指导意义，或者借口现在是20世纪80年代，认为马克思主义已经过时的观点，都是错误的，是资产阶级自由化的表现。但如果把马克思主义凝固化起来，不去研究新情况，解决新问题，用教条主义的态度对待马克思主义，也是错误的。在这方面，邓小平同志是我们的楷模。他一方面旗帜鲜明地提出坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化；另一方面提出建设有中国特色的社会主义，成为我国改革开放政策的总设计师。在他的倡导下，我们的党在十一届三中全会以来探讨了一系列由实践提出的新问题，比如社会主义初级阶段的问题，有计划的商品经济问题，现阶段的所有制问题，生产力标准问题等等。这些问题的研究，不但具有重大的理论意义，而且具有重大的实际意义。除这些问题需要继续加以研究以外，还有许多其他问题也值得研究。比如，社会主义制度如何实现自我完善的机制？这是一个重大的理论问题。如果解决得好，对社会主义的进一步发展具有指导意义。不可否认，几乎所有的社会主义国家，包括苏联、东欧，也包括我国都没有解决好这个问题。这个问题不解决就不能充分体现社会主义制度的优越性，就很难使社会主义制度具有强烈的吸引力和凝聚力。又比如，关于社会公正的问题，也应当引起注意。社会主义消灭了人剥削人的制度，实现了最大的社会公正，但由于社会主义初级阶段生产力水平的低下，不可避免地存在着多种形式的所有制和分配形式，也不可避免地存在着利益分配的不公这种新的社会不公正。这个问题必须加以解决，如果不解决，有可能成为社会不安定的因素。此外，第二次世界大战以后国际上也出现了许多新的情况，科学技术的迅猛发展也提出了许多新的问题，这些也都需要加以研究。总之，需要研究的问题很多，现在正是理论工作者英雄用武之时。党校系统这些年来在理论联系实际方面，在创造性地研究马克思主义理论方面做了不少工作，取得了一定的成果，但距离党对我们的要求，距离广大学员的要求，距离党校应当起到的作用都还很远。我们应当加倍努力，在理论联系实际上狠下功夫，在马克思主义原理这门主课的创新上狠下功夫，把党校的教学改革落到实处，把党校的教学水平提高到新的高度，为更好地完成党中央交给我们的培训中高级干部这一光荣的任务而努力奋斗！
