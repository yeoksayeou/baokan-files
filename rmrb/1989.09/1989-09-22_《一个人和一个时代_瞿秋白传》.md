This year marks the 90th anniversary of Comrade Qu Qiubai's birth. The Tianjin People's Publishing House has published Wang Guanchuan's 500,000-word biography, "A Person and an Era: A Biography of Qu Qiubai," as a tribute to him.

Previously, due to the interference of the ultra-left line, research on Qu Qiubai faced many difficulties. After the liberation of thought, he was re-evaluated as a great Marxist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, theorist, and propagandist. It is under this context that the biographer was able to narrate Qu Qiubai's life more comprehensively and objectively in the book.

Since the subject of the biography is an important figure in modern Chinese history, especially in the history of the Communist Party of China, the author places him in the context of the times, particularly during important historical periods, striving to understand the influence of the era on him. At the same time, through the activities of this representative Chinese Communist and outstanding intellectual during these historical periods, from studying in Beijing to traveling in the famine-stricken regions, from overseeing central work to being marginalized and attacked, from cultural activities in Shanghai to being captured and martyred in the Soviet area, the author also examines the international and domestic revolutionary struggles, party building, and cultural construction of that era. The biography not only depicts the complex inner journey of an intellectual engaged in political movements and cultural construction but also sketches the face of an era.

As the title suggests, the author closely integrates a person and an era. Achieving this integration is inseparable from the author's rich materials, profound scholarship, and far-sighted insights.

The author has put a lot of effort into collecting materials. In addition to a large amount of textual materials, he also conducted field investigations.

Since the author works in Harbin, he has the advantage of proximity. In the chapter “The Journey and Mindset from China to the Famine-Stricken Region” in this book, based on Qu Qiubai's statement in "Famine-Stricken Journey" that "Harbin provides the air, Manzhouli provides the facts, and Chita provides the theory," the author gives a detailed examination of Qu Qiubai's journey and the complex situation in the Far East at that time. He also, based on his discovery of new materials, raises the question of whether there was a practical channel for the introduction of Marxism into China at the beginning of the 20th century, distinguishing it from the textual transmission in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places at that time. He calls this channel the "Red Silk Road." This not only provides a good explanation of Qu Qiubai's thought development process but also helps in studying the spread of Marxism in China.

For example, when writing about the historical facts from Qu Qiubai's arrest to his martyrdom, the author interviewed Red Army soldiers who fought alongside Qu Qiubai and obtained first-hand materials, making the narrative detailed and vivid.

The biography also permeates the author's academic personality.

The author has been engaged in the study of modern Chinese literary history for many years. Therefore, in this biography, he provides detailed records and insightful analyses of Qu Qiubai's outstanding contributions to introducing Marxist literary theory and using this theory to analyze Chinese literary issues and writers' works. He also records and analyzes in detail Qu Qiubai's connections with the cultural circle, especially with Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and others.

In addition, the author also gives a relatively objective and fair evaluation of Qu Qiubai's merits and demerits in party struggles.

As an intellectual politician, Qu Qiubai has his weaknesses. The author portrays his personal weaknesses, his tragic fate, and his painful state of mind. The author does not conceal his mistakes and points out the losses these mistakes brought to the Chinese revolution. Regarding his last revelation of his thoughts in "Extra Words," the biographer also provides a relatively fair analysis.

This book is beneficial for those who are familiar with and study Qu Qiubai, as well as for those who are familiar with and study that era and the struggles of Communists in that era.

### 《一个人和一个时代——瞿秋白传》

    《一个人和一个时代——瞿秋白传》
    万晓
    今年是瞿秋白同志诞辰九十周年，天津人民出版社出版了王观泉著的五十多万字的《一个人和一个时代——瞿秋白传》，这是对他的一种隆重的纪念。
    以往因为极左路线的干扰，瞿秋白研究困难较多。思想解放后，他被重新评定为伟大的马克思主义者、卓越的无产阶级革命家、理论家和宣传家。正是在这种形势下，传记作者才有可能在书中较为翔实、较为客观地叙述瞿秋白的一生。
    因为传主是中国现代史特别是中共党史上的重要人物，作者把他放在时代的氛围里，尤其放在一些重要的历史时期，力求弄清楚时代给予他的影响；同时也通过这个有代表性的中国共产党人和优秀的知识分子在这些历史时期里的活动，从北京求学到饿乡游历，从主持中央工作到受到排挤打击，从上海的文化活动到留守苏区被俘牺牲等事件的描述，也考察了那个时代的国际国内革命斗争、党的建设和文化建设情况；既描绘一个从事政治运动和文化建设的知识分子的复杂的心路历程，又勾勒了一个时代的面貌。
    正如书名所示，作者将一个人和一个时代紧密地结合在一起。而做到这种结合，是与作者所掌握的丰富的材料、深厚的学力和高远的识见分不开的。
    作者为搜集资料很下功夫，除大量文字资料外，还进行实地考察。
    因为作者是在哈尔滨市工作，有地利，作者在该书“自中国至饿乡的路程心程”一章中，依据瞿秋白《饿乡纪程》中“哈尔滨得空气，满洲里得事实，赤塔得理论”的说法，对瞿秋白这段行程以及当时远东地区复杂形势给以较为细密的考察，并据他发现的新材料，提出世纪初马克思主义传入中国是否有一条实际通道的问题，以区别于那时北京、上海等地的文字传述。他把这条通道称为“红色丝绸之路”。这不但对瞿秋白的思想发展过程有很好的说明，而且对研究马克思主义在中国的传播也很有帮助。
    又如在写瞿秋白从被捕到牺牲这段史实时，采访与瞿秋白一起战斗过的红军战士、掌握第一手材料，因此写得详细生动。
    传记还渗透着作者的学术个性。
    作者从事中国现代文学史研究多年，因此在这本传记中，对瞿秋白介绍马克思主义文论的卓越贡献以及运用这种理论分析中国文艺问题和作家作品方面的功绩；对瞿秋白同文化界的联系，特别是同鲁迅、茅盾等人的联系，都有详实的记录和独到的分析。
    此外，对瞿秋白在党内斗争的功过是非，作者也作了较为客观公正的评价。
    作为一个知识分子型的政治家，瞿秋白有他的弱点。作者刻画了他自身弱点、他的悲剧性命运以及他的痛苦的心境。作者不掩饰他的错误，指出这些错误给中国革命带来的损失。对于他最后一次披露心迹的《多余的话》，传记作者也给予较为中肯的分析。
    这本书无论对熟悉、研究瞿秋白这个人，还是对熟悉研究那个时代，熟悉那个时代共产党人的奋斗历程，我想是不无裨益的。
