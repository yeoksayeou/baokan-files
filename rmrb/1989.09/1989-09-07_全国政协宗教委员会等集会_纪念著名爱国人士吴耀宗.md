The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Religious Committee and the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee held a meeting today in the Great Hall of the People to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the passing of the famous patriot Wu Yaozong.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Buddhist Association of China, Zhao Puxiu, spoke at the meeting. He said that Wu Yaozong dedicated his life to the pursuit of truth, love for his country, and love for the people. During his youth, he actively participated in the anti-Japanese democratic movement; during the War of Liberation, he strongly supported the patriotic students' anti-hunger, anti-civil war, and anti-persecution movements. After the founding of New China, he initiated the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement, advocating for the Chinese Christian Church to achieve self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, thereby breaking free from foreign influence and control.

Minister of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, Ren Wuzhi, also spoke at the meeting. He hoped that the religious community would continue to strengthen education in patriotism, socialism, and independence, and continue to promote the role of various levels of Christian Three-Self Patriotic organizations, passing down the Three-Self Patriotic righteous cause from one generation to the next.
