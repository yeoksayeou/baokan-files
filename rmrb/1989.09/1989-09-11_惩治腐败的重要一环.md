	The former deputy secretary and deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Foreign Trade Commission, Li Rui, used the name of central leaders to deceive and swindle, illegally established a company, embezzled a large sum of money, and enriched himself. Recently, he was expelled from the Party. The handling of this case reflects the Party and government's resolve to combat corruption.

	Cleaning up and rectifying companies is a crucial step in combating corruption and strengthening clean governance. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have decided that in the near future, seven matters of great concern to the people will be addressed, with "further cleaning up and rectifying companies" listed as the first. This shows the high level of importance the Party and government place on this task. The facts have proven that our Party's stance on anti-corruption is not just empty talk, but involves concrete steps and measures. Dealing with cases like Li Rui, who, despite repeated warnings from the central authorities, seriously violated laws and regulations, and shutting down such illegally established companies, demonstrates our determination to implement concrete measures through solid work.

	Li Rui was a veteran Party member who joined the revolution in the 1930s and held important leadership positions in various departments. However, he failed to resist the corrupting influence of the exploiting class's decadent ideology, especially in the new situation of reform and opening up, he relaxed his ideological transformation, his revolutionary will weakened, and he gradually became corrupt and fell, ultimately being expelled from the Party. The main reason for Li Rui's mistakes lies within himself, but we must also recognize that certain approval departments lost their principles and abused their power, providing conditions for Li Rui's deception, illegal establishment of companies, and eventually economic crimes. This incident also shows that the measures proposed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to clean up and rectify companies are very necessary. They not only help to rectify the economic environment and order but also help to eliminate corrupt elements within the Party. At the same time, they save and educate those Party and government officials who have made such mistakes. As long as all levels of Party and government leadership, as well as all levels of disciplinary and supervisory departments, actively and seriously grasp this work, cleaning up one company at a time and investigating one case at a time, then combating corruption will definitely achieve results as required by the central authorities and win the trust of the people.

### 惩治腐败的重要一环

　　惩治腐败的重要一环
    原山西省进出口委党组副书记、副主任李瑞打着中央领导同志的旗号招摇撞骗，非法办公司，骗取巨款，中饱私囊，最近被开除党籍。这一案件的处理，反映了我们党和政府惩治腐败的决心。
    清理整顿公司是惩治腐败、加强廉政建设的重要一环。党中央、国务院已作出决定，近期要做七件人民群众普遍关心的事情，其中，“进一步清理整顿公司”被列入第一件，这说明了党和政府对这项任务的高度重视。事实证明，我们党讲反腐败，决不是一句空话，而是有步骤有具体措施的。查处像李瑞这种不顾中央三令五申、严重违法违纪的领导干部，取缔这类非法办的公司，就是表明我们通过扎扎实实的工作，决心把具体措施落到实处。
    李瑞曾是30年代参加革命的老党员，并担任过一些部门的重要领导职务，但由于未能自觉抵制剥削阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀，特别是在改革开放的新形势下放松思想改造，革命意志衰退，因而逐步腐化堕落，直至被党清除。李瑞犯错误主要原因在他自身，但我们也不能不看到，某些审批部门丧失原则，滥用职权，为李瑞招摇撞骗、非法办公司、直至经济犯罪提供了条件。这件事也说明，党中央、国务院提出清理整顿公司的措施，是十分必要的，它不仅有利于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，还有利于清除党内腐败分子，同时挽救和教育那些犯了这类错误的党政机关的干部。只要各级党政领导机关、各级纪检和监察部门积极认真地抓这项工作，一个公司一个公司地清理，一个案件一个案件地查处，那么，惩治腐败就一定能够按照中央的要求，抓出成效来，取信于人民。
