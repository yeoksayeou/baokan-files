New Blossoms in the Military Arts Garden

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the military's cultural work has entered its best period since the founding of the nation, marking the most vibrant decade in terms of thought and achievements.

A significant indicator of this is Deng Xiaoping's proposal of the basic guidelines for cultural work in the new era during his congratulatory remarks at the Fourth National Congress on Literature and Art. This proposal has fundamentally corrected the guiding ideology of military cultural work. Based on this, the entire military's cultural workers have reflected on history, rectified past mistakes, liberated their minds, and promoted creativity. In recent years, they have made valuable explorations in reflecting and promoting the reforms of the military and the nation.

Military cultural work has maintained a theme of revolutionary heroism and patriotism, providing the military and society with a large amount of positive and healthy spiritual nourishment. Just last year, the military's professional writers collectively created and published 39 novels, 505 novellas, and 52 film and television scripts. Over the years, military cultural works have accounted for a significant proportion in various national awards. Works such as "The Flowers Beneath the Gallows" have been widely welcomed by both military and civilian audiences. At the same time, military arts have quickly stepped onto the world stage. Military acrobats have consecutively won championships in international competitions, and several performing troupes have achieved success in their overseas tours.

Deeply engaging with the troops and serving the soldiers has effectively promoted the enhancement of the troops' combat effectiveness. According to rough statistics, the 12 performing troupes in the military collectively perform over a thousand shows for the troops each year, reaching an audience of several million, and are praised as "non-commissioned political instructors."

    军中艺苑绽开新葩
    党的十一届三中全会以后，军队的文艺工作处于建国后的最好时期，是思想最活跃、成果最丰硕的十年。
    其显著的标志是，邓小平同志在四届文代会祝辞中提出新时期文艺工作的基本纲领，使军队文艺工作的指导思想从根本上得到端正。在此基础上，全军文艺工作者反思历史，拨乱反正，解放思想，繁荣创作。特别是近几年，在反映和促进军队、国家的改革上，进行了可贵的探索。
    部队文艺工作保持了以革命英雄主义和爱国主义为主旋律的思想艺术品格，给军队和社会生产了大量积极的、健康向上的精神食粮。仅去年，全军专业作家共创作发表长篇小说39部、中篇小说505部、电影电视文学剧本52部。历年来在全国各门类评奖中军队文艺均占相当大的比例。《高山下的花环》等大批优秀作品受到军内外广大群众的欢迎。同时，军队文艺还以较快的步伐走向世界。军队杂技健儿在世界比赛中连连夺魁，一些文工团出访演出获得成功。
    深入部队为兵服务，有力地促进了部队战斗力的提高。据粗略统计，全军12个文工团，每年共为部队演出都在千场以上，观众达数百万人次，被誉为“不在编的指导员”。
