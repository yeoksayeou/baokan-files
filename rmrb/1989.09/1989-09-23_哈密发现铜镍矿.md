A large copper-nickel mine base is expected to be established in Hami, Xinjiang. This was revealed at a special meeting held by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources in Urumqi.

The Hami large copper-nickel mine base was discovered by the Sixth Geological Brigade of the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Five ore deposits have been identified, with a mineralized belt covering an area of 3,400 square kilometers. About one-quarter of the ore is rich in minerals, and the nickel ore reserves rank second in the country, just behind the Jinchuan nickel mine in Gansu. Additionally, the mineral belt contains associated precious metals such as cobalt, gold, and silver.

It is reported that the Hami large copper-nickel mineral belt has a gentle terrain and convenient transportation, making it highly valuable for comprehensive utilization.
