	New Tasks After Receiving the Advanced Title

	After our city's Zhong District People's Hospital was awarded the title of "National Advanced Collective for Civilized Health Construction in 1987" by the Ministry of Health, it faced new challenges.

	The Analysis of Demands and Expectations

	Patients who come for treatment often relate the behavior of all hospital staff to the standards of a ministry-level advanced unit. Long queues for medication prompt some to complain: "What kind of ministry-level civilized unit is this, making us wait so long for medicine?" Some patients, upon hearing that they need to be referred to another hospital, sternly question the doctor: "You are a ministry-level civilized unit, why are you pushing me out?" Some medical staff consider this to be an unreasonable demand on an advanced unit. To address this, the hospital party branch organized a discussion titled "If I Were a Patient." Deputy Director Shao Lizeng said: "When people come to an advanced unit for medical treatment, they hope to receive good service. If their expectations are not met, they will naturally have complaints and grievances." The union chairman added: "Many patients come specifically because we are a ministry-level civilized unit." Director Zhang Baoping believed: "Wherever there are complaints from the public, even if it's a misunderstanding, it indicates that our work has some problems." Through the discussion, the staff accepted the public's criticisms. The hospital then made adjustments in management systems and medical quality standards, adding some convenience measures, implementing a system where medical staff wear name tags and accept public supervision.

	The Unity of Insults and Praise

	Zhong District People's Hospital is responsible for the public medical care of over 3,000 people. One person who enjoys public medical care specifically requested royal jelly, a self-pay medication. When the pharmacy staff pointed this out and asked him to pay for it himself, he insulted them but they upheld national interests. To plug every loophole in public medical treatment, the staff increased their workload many times over. The hospital has repeatedly inspected the pricing in the traditional Chinese medicine room, with compliance rates always above 99%. The relevant departments of the city once inspected the fee management of 48 hospitals, and Zhong District People's Hospital ranked at the top.

	The Collision of Money and Medical Ethics

	An 83-year-old man, Liu Dianju, from Ancheng Welfare Institute, came to the hospital alone due to stomach pain. After examination, the doctors decided he needed surgery immediately. However, the old man had no money on him. The doctors knew that in similar situations, if the hospital admitted the patient for treatment, it could lead to disputes over unpaid fees. At that time, the hospital still had several thousand yuan in unpaid fees. Nevertheless, the doctors admitted the old man to the ward without hesitation and performed the surgery on time. They believed that the hospital should consider economic benefits, medical effects, and social spiritual benefits. If they abandoned medical ethics and only cared about money, it would not be in line with the medical ethics of saving lives and helping the injured.

### 获得先进称号后的新课题

　　获得先进称号后的新课题
    我市中区人民医院荣获了卫生部授予的1987年度“全国卫生文明建设先进集体”的称号后，又认真回答遇到的新课题。
      苛求与期求的辩析
    前来就诊的患者爱把全院工作人员的一举一动与部级先进单位连在一起。取药的排成了长队，有人便说：“什么部级文明单位，拿药等这么长时间。”有的病人听说需要转诊，就严厉地质问医生：“你们是部级文明单位，怎么把我往外推？”有的医护人员认为这是对先进单位的苛求。为此，院党支部在全院开展了“假如我是病人”的讨论。副院长邵立增说：“群众到先进单位求医，希望得到好的服务，如果他们的要求不能得到适当的满足，当然会有意见，发牢骚。”工会主席说：“许多病人就是冲着部级文明单位这块牌子来的。”院长张保平认为：“凡是群众有意见的地方，即使是误会，恰恰表明我们的工作或多或少存在一些问题。”经过讨论，职工对群众的批评服气了。院里又从管理体制、医疗质量标准等方面作了修正，增添了一些便民措施，实行了医务人员挂牌服务，接受群众监督。
      辱骂与赞扬的统一
    市中区人民医院担负着全区3000多人的公费医疗。有一个享受公费医疗的人点名要人参蜂王浆，药剂人员指出蜂王浆是自费药，让他自己掏钱，虽然遭到辱骂，但却维护了国家利益。为堵住公费治疗的每一个漏洞，职工们不惜增加成倍的工作量。院方多次抽查过中药房划价情况，每次抽查，符合规定率均在99％以上。市有关部门曾一次抽查了48家医院收费管理情况，市中区人民医院名列前茅。
        金钱与医德的撞击
    安城福利院83岁的老人刘佃举因肚子痛，只身一人跑到医院。经检查，医生认为需要马上做手术。但是，老人身上没有分文。医生们清楚，类似情况，如收院治疗，容易发生欠资扯皮的事。当时医院还有五六千元欠资尚未收回。可医生们还是毫不犹豫地将老人收入病房，及时为老人做了手术。他们认为，医院要讲经济效益，也要注重医疗效果和社会精神效益。如果抛弃医德，只认钱，不认人，是不符合救死扶伤的医德的行为。
