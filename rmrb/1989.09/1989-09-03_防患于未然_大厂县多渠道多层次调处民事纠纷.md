    Preventing Problems Before They Occur
    —Daxian County's Multi-Channel, Multi-Level Approach to Resolving Civil Disputes

    In response to the increasing number of civil disputes in rural areas and the escalation of conflicts into criminal cases, Daxian County in Hebei Province has intensified its efforts in rural civil mediation. In 1988, the county reported 650 civil disputes, with a mediation success rate of 96.9%, effectively preventing 16 potential major criminal cases.

    The county's primary approaches include:

    1. Strengthening grassroots organizational construction and enhancing the quality of mediators. Village-level mediation organizations are typically led by the village party branch secretary or village head, who also serves as the mediation director. The organization consists of 3 to 5 members known for their reputation and policy understanding. These mediation organizations operate under a contract responsibility system, maintaining records of dispute occurrence rates, mediation success rates, and the rate of disputes escalating into criminal cases. These records are used as part of the criteria for evaluating village cadres and determining their compensation at the end of the year. Public security and judicial departments also conduct centralized training for mediators at the township level, at least once a month. Whenever a typical case arises, mediators document it for collective discussion and study during training sessions. These measures have increased mediators' legal knowledge and reduced the practice of merely smoothing over disputes.

    2. Conducting dispute occurrence predictions. Township and village mediators, based on higher-level directives and seasonal characteristics, focus on identifying potential dispute hotspots and households or individuals prone to disputes. They regularly visit these households to listen to residents' concerns and detect dispute trends. On August 15, 1988, in Wangtang Village, Chenfu Township, Wang Zhenxi, a villager, argued with his daughter-in-law over food and money, leading to a verbal altercation. When his daughter intervened, the daughter-in-law accused her of taking sides. In a fit of anger, Wang Zhenxi smashed his daughter-in-law's pot, and his sister-in-law bit his daughter-in-law's leg. The daughter-in-law then damaged her sister-in-law's new Flying Pigeon bicycle and the next day brought 10 relatives armed with weapons for revenge. The parents-in-law also prepared knives and sticks for defense. Due to the township mediator Liu Shun's vigilance over this "key household," he arrived just in time to stop the impending fight and helped resolve the elderly couple's maintenance issues. Last year, 33 villages in the county did not experience any civil disputes due to effective preventive measures.

    防患于未然
    ——大厂县多渠道多层次调处民事纠纷
    河北省大厂回族自治县针对农村民事纠纷逐渐增多，矛盾激化酿成刑事案件日趋严重的问题，在农村大力加强民事调解工作。1988年，全县共发生民事纠纷650件，调解成功率达96.9％，防止了16件可能引发的重大刑事案件。
    这个县的主要做法有两条：
    一、加强基层组织建设，提高调解人员素质。村级调解组织一般由村党支部书记或村主任兼调解主任。选聘3—5名有声望、有政策水平的同志为成员组成。调解组织都有承包责任制，建立了纠纷发生率、调解成功率和纠纷激化酿成刑事案件率三本帐，年终作为考核村干部和确定报酬的依据之一。公安、司法等部门还以乡镇为单位，集中调解员面授、培训，每月至少一次。每遇典型案例，调解员都记录下来，在培训中供集体讨论研究。这些办法使调解员们增多了法律知识，减少了调解和稀泥的现象。
    二、进行纠纷发生预测。乡、村调解人员根据上级的中心工作，不同季节的特点，注意研究这一时期可能引发纠纷的矛盾焦点和发生纠纷的多发户、易发户和重点人，定期到户听群众反映问题，发现纠纷动向。去年8月15日，陈府乡王唐庄村民王振喜向长子要口粮和钱时，婆媳发生口角，回娘家的女儿劝了弟媳两句，弟媳反说她拉偏架。一气之下，王振喜砸了儿媳妇的锅，大姑咬伤弟媳妇的腿。弟媳妇将大姑子的新飞鸽车砸坏，第二天叫来哥嫂等10余人，携带凶器准备报复。公婆这方也携带菜刀、木棒等准备应战。由于乡调解员刘顺对这个“重点户”注意防范，关键时刻及时赶到，制止了双方将要发生的械斗，并帮助解决了两位老人的赡养问题。去年全县有33个村由于预防工作做得好，未发生一起民事纠纷。（于景会）
