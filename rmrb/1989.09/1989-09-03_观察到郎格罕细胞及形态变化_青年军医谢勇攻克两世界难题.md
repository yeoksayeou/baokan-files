Young military doctor Xie Yong, at the age of 28, has made significant breakthroughs in the study of Langerhans cells, a crucial immune cell in human skin. He has independently developed methods to address two global challenges: the difficulty of locating these cells under an electron microscope and the challenge of observing their morphological changes. His work has garnered attention from both Chinese and international dermatology experts.

Xie Yong is a dermatologist at the Second Military Medical University's affiliated Longhai Hospital. Since 1985, under the guidance of his mentors, dermatology experts Professor Zhou Xinyao, Professor Zhao Huijuan, and Associate Professor Zheng Maorong, he has been researching Langerhans cells. Initially, he used a combination of light microscopy and electron microscopy with APT enzyme histochemistry to locate Langerhans cells. This method combines the visibility of histochemistry with the specificity of electron microscopy, clearly revealing the ultrastructure of the cells and solving the problem of difficulty in locating Langerhans cells even under an electron microscope.

Subsequently, Xie Yong employed stereological methods to perform quantitative morphological analysis of Langerhans cells under different conditions. This approach quantitatively reflects the morphological characteristics of these cells, opening a new path for Langerhans cell research. Experts in the field believe that this research has reached an advanced international level.

    观察到郎格罕细胞及形态变化
    青年军医谢勇攻克两世界难题
    本报上海电　年仅28岁的青年军医谢勇在人体表皮极为重要的免疫细胞——郎格罕细胞的研究中，独辟蹊径，解决了这种细胞在电镜下难找和形态变化难以观察的两道世界性难题，引起中外皮肤病专家的注目。
    谢勇是第二军医大学附属长海医院皮肤科医师。1985年起，他在导师、皮肤病专家周新耀教授和赵慧娟教授、郑茂荣副教授指导下，研究郎格罕细胞。他首先用光镜、电镜共同的APT酶组织化学技术寻找郎格罕细胞，将组织化学的可视性与电镜的特异性结合起来，清楚地显示出细胞的超微结构，解决了通常即使在电镜下也很难找到的郎格罕细胞这一难题。
    随后，谢勇又运用体视学方法对不同条件下的郎格罕细胞进行形态定量分析，以量的形式反映出这种细胞的形态特征，为郎格罕细胞研究开辟了一新途径。有关专家认为，这项研究达到了国际先进水平。
