East German leader Honecker emphasized that adhering to Marxism-Leninism and applying it creatively according to specific circumstances, combining the continuity and innovativeness of policies, is the principle for the GDR to solve social development issues and determine its domestic and foreign policies.

Honecker made these remarks in a lengthy article he wrote for the magazine "Einheit" to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The "Neues Deutschland" newspaper today reprinted the entire article.

In the article, Honecker said that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is the greatest achievement of the revolutionary German workers' movement. Over the past 40 years, the GDR has achieved tremendous successes. As stated in the program of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany adopted at the 9th Party Congress in 1976, this is a historical process of profound changes in politics, economy, society, and spiritual culture. However, this change should not be a regression to capitalism, but rather a strengthening of socialism, continuously enhancing the potential of socialism, increasing the attractiveness of socialism, demonstrating the superiority of socialism, expanding the achievements of socialism, and advancing for the welfare of the people.

The article stressed that in implementing policies that combine continuity and innovativeness, one must adhere to the universal laws of socialist construction, strengthen the leadership role of Marxist-Leninist parties, strengthen the connection between the party and the masses, maintain the public ownership of decisive means of production, and, based on socialist ideology, widely involve the working people in the leadership and planning of social processes.

The article also noted that developed capitalist countries are leading in science and technology and economy, and this should not be underestimated. However, it is equally important not to overlook the fact that there are large numbers of unemployed, homeless, and new poverty phenomena in those countries. These are the unchangeable characteristics of the capitalist system.

Honecker expressed that the GDR will steadfastly strive for the stability of socialism and continue to work for peace in Europe and the world.

	Berlin, September 7 (Xinhua) — To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, and the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, as well as the first anniversary of Beijing and Berlin becoming sister cities, the "Beijing Week" was officially launched today at the TV Tower Exhibition Hall in Berlin. The event was jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Government and the Berlin Municipal Government.

	German Socialist Unity Party Politburo member and first secretary of the Berlin District Party Committee, Schabowski, German Socialist Unity Party Central Committee member and Mayor of Berlin, Klopfer, and German Socialist Unity Party International Liaison Department Director, Sieber, attended the opening ceremony. The Beijing delegation, led by the deputy mayor of Beijing, Wu Yi, and the Chinese ambassador to the GDR, Zhang Da Ke, also attended the opening ceremony.

    昂纳克撰文纪念民主德国成立四十周年
    坚持马列主义扩大社会主义成果
    柏林“北京周”开幕
    本报柏林9月5日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国领导人昂纳克强调，坚持马克思列宁主义并根据具体情况创造性地加以运用，将政策的持续性和革新性结合起来，是民德解决社会发展问题，确定内外政策的原则。
    昂纳克是在《统一》杂志上发表的为纪念民主德国成立40周年而撰写的长篇文章中这样说的。《新德意志报》今天全文转载了这篇文章。
    昂纳克在文章中说，民主德国的成立是革命的德国工人运动的最伟大成果。民主德国成立40年来取得了巨大成就。正如1976年党的9大通过的德国统一社会党纲领所提出的那样，这是一个在政治、经济、社会和精神文化等各方面发生深刻变革的历史性进程。但是这种变革不能是倒退到资本主义，而应是为了社会主义的强大，不断增强社会主义的潜力，增加社会主义的吸引力，发挥社会主义的优越性，扩大社会主义的成果，为了人们的福利而向前迈进。
    文章强调，在贯彻持续性和革新性相结合的政策时，要遵循社会主义建设的普遍规律，加强马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，加强党和人民群众的联系，坚持决定性生产资料的公有制，根据社会主义思想，广泛吸收劳动人民参加对社会进程的领导和计划。
    文章还说，发达资本主义国家在科技和经济方面处于领先地位，对此我们不能低估。但是，同样也不能忽视，那里存在大量失业、无家可归和新的贫困现象。这是资本主义制度不可改变的标志。
    昂纳克表示，民主德国将坚定地为社会主义的稳定而奋斗，继续为欧洲和世界和平而努力。
    本报柏林9月7日电　记者许宏治报道：为了庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年和德意志民主共和国成立40周年，庆祝两国建交40周年和北京、柏林结为友好城市一周年，由北京市人民政府和柏林市政府共同主办的柏林“北京周”开幕式今天上午在柏林电视塔展厅隆重举行。
