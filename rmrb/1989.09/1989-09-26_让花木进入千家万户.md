On a sunny Sunday, Wang Zezhuo, the director of Jinan City Nursery, strolled through the streets of Jinan, the city of springs.

He noticed that some residential buildings had potted flowers on their balconies, a sight he hadn't seen in a long time.

He also saw that some hotels had created flower beds at their entrances and placed beautiful flowers in their rooms, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The presence of flowers and trees brought a sense of spring to the entire garden, and even a small potted plant could make the whole house feel fresh and lively. This sparked a commercial idea in Wang Zezhuo's mind. It was the early 1980s, when China's reform and opening-up policy had just begun. He thought that saplings and flowers were "close relatives," and the nursery had the conditions to cultivate flowers and evergreen trees, providing people with the convenience of pursuing beauty. He decided to give it a try, raising 6,000 yuan to import 20,000 saplings of snow pine, cypress, azaleas, and tea flowers from other provinces, carefully cultivating and propagating them. The news spread, and people rushed to buy them, all 20,000 saplings were sold out in an instant. The profit was 14,000 yuan.

However, the nursery had always produced hybrid poplar saplings according to the upper-level requirements, which was a mandatory production plan, and the nursery had no right to change it. The saplings produced were directly allocated by the upper levels. These hybrid poplar saplings had a long growth cycle, usually taking 3 to 4 years before they could be sold, with low economic benefits, and the products were outdated with a low survival rate, making them unpopular with users. The local nursery was the only one producing saplings, and there were no other options, so the upper levels had to do it this way. Over time, users simply did not want these saplings, causing a large accumulation. The nursery had to give them away for free. Later, even when they were given away for free, no one wanted them. Thus, the scene of burning saplings unfolded. Once, 300,000 saplings were burned.

This fire made Wang Zezhuo and every leader of the nursery feel a sense of crisis and urgency. They wanted to break the 30-year-old pattern and establish a new business concept, that is, what to produce should only be based on market demand. Wang Zezhuo delved into the market to gather information. He compared the new variety of white poplar with hybrid poplar: white poplar has a wide adaptability, early sprouting, late leaf fall, good quality, long life, and beautiful tree crown, known as the "silk of wood." Each white poplar sapling could be sold for 2 yuan, while hybrid poplar only sold for 5 fen, the benefits were like heaven and earth. He decided to eliminate all hybrid poplar and introduce high-quality white poplar saplings from within and outside the province as the nursery's flagship product to enter the market.

Obtaining various scientific data and mastering the growth laws is the prerequisite for achieving high-quality and high-yield white poplar. For this, Wang Zezhuo led the research team to select 2,000 white poplar saplings as test points, testing item by item. Wang Zezhuo, who was obsessed, observed day and night and often stayed overnight in the office. The rigorous scientific attitude and hard work finally yielded fruitful results. The output value of white poplar per mu increased from the original 1,200 yuan to 3,000 yuan.

By the end of 1988, the nursery's 9 main tree sapling varieties, including white poplar, Chinese scholar tree, phoenix tree, and arrow willow, had all been updated and replaced, achieving varietal improvement.

Nanjing wanted to introduce weeping willow, Tianjin wanted to plant yellow cypress, and many industrial and mining enterprises urgently needed snow pine, cypress, Chinese juniper, and holly... The market was like a "magic wand," directing and adjusting the nursery's varieties. They bought tens of thousands of potted flowers and tens of thousands of evergreen tree saplings from all over the country every year for propagation. They invested 500,000 yuan to build a modern large greenhouse, with temperature control, irrigation, and other fully automated operations, with more than 1,000 varieties of flowers and trees. Many domestic and foreign businessmen came to place orders. Japanese friends came and praised the cherry blossoms that were as bright as clouds; Singaporean businessmen were interested in the nursery's bonsai; Italian businessmen asked how to solve the packaging if the nursery's flowers were sent across the ocean...

New challenges kept coming to Jinan City Nursery, and they accepted the challenge, submitting an eye-catching answer sheet: they threw away the hat of loss for more than 20 years, and the output value and profit increased by 50% every year. The nursery was repeatedly rated as an advanced unit in Shandong Province and Jinan City.

    让花木进入千家万户
    许子仪
    一个阳光明媚的星期天，济南市苗圃主任王泽澍徜徉在泉城济南大街上。
    咦，一些居民楼的阳光上出现了盆栽鲜花，这可是久违的了。
    呵，一些招待所的门外开辟了花畦，房间里也摆上了娇美的花，姹紫嫣红，充满生机。花木扶疏显得春色满园，一盆小花也使满屋生春。商品生产意识就这样在王泽澍的心田中萌发了，其时正是我国改革刚刚起步的80年代初。他想到，树苗和花卉是“近亲”，苗圃有条件种植花卉和常青树，给人们提供追求美的方便。他决定试试，筹集了6000元从外地引进了2万株雪松、龙柏、杜鹃、茶花等花卉苗和常青树苗，精心培育繁育。消息传开，人们争相购买，2万株一抢而光。算盘一响，净赚1.4万元。
    然而，苗圃过去一直是按上级的要求生产杂交杨树苗，这是指令性生产计划，苗圃无权改变，生产的树苗由上级直接调拨。这种杂交杨树苗生长周期长，一般得3至4年才能出圃，经济效益低，且产品老化，成活率低，不受用户欢迎。当地生产树苗的单位独此一家，别无分号，上头就让这么干。时间久了，用户索性不要这种苗了，造成大量积压。苗圃只好往外白送。后来，连白送人家也不要了。于是便演出了火烧树苗的一幕。一次烧了3万多株。
    这把火使王泽澍和苗圃的每一个领导成员都加重了危机感和紧迫感，他们要打破30年一贯制的局面，树立全新的经营观念，即生产什么，只能根据市场的需求。王泽澍一头扎进市场抓信息。他把新品种毛白杨和杂交杨做了一个比较：毛白杨生长适应性广，发芽早，落叶晚，本质好，寿命长，树冠也美，有“木中之缎”的雅称。毛白杨苗每株可卖2元，杂交杨只卖5分钱，二者效益天上地下。他毅然决定，淘汰全部的杂交杨，从省内外引进优质毛白杨苗，作为苗圃的拳头产品进行开发，打向市场。
    找出各种科学数据，掌握生长规律，是实现毛白杨优质、高产的前提。为此，王泽澍带领科研小组选择了2000株毛白杨苗作测定点，一项一项地测试。着了迷的王泽澍，日夜观察，经常在办公室过夜。严谨的科学态度，艰辛的劳作，终于结出丰硕成果。毛白杨亩产值由原来的1200元，猛增到3000元。
    到1988年底，苗圃的毛白杨、国槐、法桐、箭杆柳等9个主要树苗品种，全部更新换代，实现了良种化。
    南京想引进曲柳，天津要栽植黄杨，许多工矿企业急需雪松、龙柏、蜀桧、冬青……市场像根“魔棒”，指挥调节着苗圃的花色品种。他们每年从全国各地购进上万盆花卉和上万株常青树苗进行繁育。投资50万元建起了现代化大型温室，控温、灌溉等全部自动化操作，花木品种达1000多个。国内外许多客商前来订货。日本友人来了，他们望着灿若云霞的樱花连连称赞；新加坡的商人对苗圃的盆景很感兴趣；意大利的商人提出若把苗圃的花卉运到大洋彼岸怎样解决包装……
    新的课题不断向济南市苗圃提出，他们接受了挑战，交出了一份引人注目的答卷：扔掉了长达20多年的亏损帽子，产值、利润每年以50％的速度递增。苗圃多次被评为山东省、济南市的先进单位。
