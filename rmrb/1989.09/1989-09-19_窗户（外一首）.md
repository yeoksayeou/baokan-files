Title: Windows (and another poem)

Because of the window, sunlight enters your room,
Warming your clothes and blankets.
But you must not forget the days without windows,
The cold walls that confined you for many years.
Looking back, it seems so distant,
But you must not forget.
Now that you live in warmth,
You should cherish it all the more and often clean the glass on your windows.

You come to see the sea,
You come to see the sea
Because you have always lived on the quiet land.
You have dreamed of the sea many times,
Dreamed of the sea's hands high up,
Supporting your spine,
Making you feel the desire to conquer.
But the long road blocks you.
That sea in your dreams undulates like a mirror,
Emitting wave after wave of light,
Pushing out row after row of waves.

　　窗户（外一首）宗琮因为窗户阳光照进你的屋子温暖了你的衣服和被子但你不能忘记没有窗户的日子阴冷的墙壁困了你许多年回过头去仿佛已经遥远但你不能忘记你过上了温暖的日子该加倍珍惜该经常擦拭窗户上的玻璃
    你来看海你来看海是因为你一直生活在宁静的陆地上你不止一次地梦见过海梦见过海的手掌高高地托起你的脊梁使你产生征服的欲望而漫长的道路却将你阻挡那片海曾在你的梦中波动如镜放出一片片光推出一排排浪
