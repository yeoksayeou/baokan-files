	Bush and Shevardnadze Hold Broad-Ranging Talks
	Propose Summit Meeting; Both Sides Hope for Cooperation

	WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President George Bush held a two-hour meeting with visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the White House today. Both sides agreed that it is "necessary" to hold a U.S.-Soviet summit, although the specific schedule has not yet been finalized. This was the first direct contact between Bush and a high-ranking Soviet official since he took office.

	U.S. Secretary of State James Baker also participated in the meeting. Both sides described the talks as "extremely broad and fruitful," but there were differences on the issue of Soviet aid to Nicaragua. A senior White House official said that because both sides had adjusted their positions on many issues related to arms control, this had "injected momentum" into the preparations for the U.S.-Soviet summit.

	Shevardnadze handed Bush a long letter from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It is reported that the letter proposed some new suggestions and concessions on arms control issues. These included: joint research on verification measures to limit the launch of nuclear warheads from the sea, without including the earlier Soviet demand to limit conventional warhead cruise missiles; the withdrawal of the requirement for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to continue to adhere to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty within a agreed period; the unconditional destruction of the controversial Soviet radar facility in Krasnoyarsk; partial agreement to the U.S. demand to limit the number of fighter-interceptor aircraft deployed within the Warsaw Pact to future agreement limits; and agreement to reach a conventional weapons limitation agreement within a year.

	After the meeting, Shevardnadze said that the Soviet Union "actively supports" Bush's proposal that the U.S. and the Soviet Union can monitor military activities in each other's airspace. Baker said that both sides also discussed the U.S. proposal for verification of the prohibition of chemical weapons and nuclear testing. A White House official also quoted Bush as saying that the U.S. still insists that a new U.S.-Soviet agreement to limit strategic weapons should not be linked to the resolution of disputes over the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and space weapons.

	Baker tonight accompanied Shevardnadze to Jackson Hole in Wyoming, where they will discuss the timetable for the next U.S.-Soviet summit. It is said that the meeting may be scheduled to take place early next year, with the U.S. as the host.

	WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze began a two-day meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, today. Both sides called for a fundamental change in U.S.-Soviet relations, moving towards a new era of comprehensive cooperation. Shevardnadze said, "Now is the time for us to move from mutual understanding to mutual action."

	Baker said, "Our relationship has developed from confrontation to dialogue, and I hope we can move towards cooperation."

	According to officials from both sides, the discussions covered methods for verifying the reduction of strategic weapons, the exchange of information on strategic military exercises, and arms control issues. However, there were sharp differences on regional conflict issues. Both sides also discussed the timing of the U.S.-Soviet summit. It is expected that both sides will reach a principle agreement on five issues, including the prohibition of chemical weapons and the lifting of travel restrictions on Inuit residents on both sides of the Bering Strait.

    布什贝克同苏外长举行内容广泛会谈
    拟议举行首脑会晤　相互希望走向合作
    本报华盛顿9月21日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今天下午同来访的苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在白宫举行了两小时会谈，双方一致同意“有必要”举行一次美苏首脑会晤，但具体日程尚未最后确定。这是布什就任总统后首次直接接触一位苏联高级官员。
    美国国务卿贝克也参加了这次会谈。双方认为这次会谈内容“异常广泛并富有成效”，但在“苏联集团”援助尼加拉瓜问题上存在分歧。白宫高级官员说，由于双方在军备控制的许多问题上调整了各自立场，因此为美苏首脑会晤“注入了动力”。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽向布什转交了戈尔巴乔夫的一封长信。据透露，信中就军控问题提出了一些新建议及让步。其内容包括：共同研究限制海上发射核弹头巡航导弹的核查措施，而不包括苏方早先要求的一并限制常规弹头巡航导弹；撤销苏美在商定时期内继续遵守反弹道导弹条约的要求；无条件销毁有争议的苏联克拉斯诺亚尔斯克的雷达设施；部分同意美方要求，将部署于华沙条约国内的战斗截击机数量限制在将来的协议范围内；同意在一年内达成限制常规武器协议等。
  苏联外长在会见后说，苏联“积极支持”布什的建议，即美苏可在双方领空监测军事行动。贝克表示，双方还讨论了美国提出的核查禁止化学武器及核试验的建议。白宫官员还援引布什的话说，美国仍坚持认为，美苏限制战略武器的新协议不应与解决反弹道导弹条约及太空武器的争端联系在一起。
    贝克今晚已陪同谢瓦尔德纳泽飞往西北部怀俄明州的杰克逊霍尔，双方将商定下次美苏首脑会晤的时间表。据说会晤可能安排在明年初举行，由美方作东道主。
    本报华盛顿9月22日电 记者仓立德报道：美国国务卿贝克同苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在怀俄明州杰克逊霍尔开始了为期两天的会谈，双方呼吁美苏关系实行根本性转变，走向全面合作的新时代。谢瓦尔德纳泽说：“现在该是我们从双方了解走向双方行动的时候了。”
    贝克表示，“我们的关系已从对抗发展为对话，我希望我们能够走向合作。”
    据双方官员透露，双方讨论了削减战略武器的核查方法问题、双方交换战略军事演习情报问题、军备控制问题等，但在地区冲突问题上存在尖锐分歧。双方还讨论了美苏首脑会晤的时机问题。预计双方将在禁止化学武器、解除对白令海峡两岸因纽特居民的旅行限制等5个问题上达成原则协议。
