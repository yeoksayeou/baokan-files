The political situation in the ancestral homeland is stable, and society is peaceful. All members of the sightseeing group are safe. Please rest assured, overseas relatives.

This message was conveyed by a group of tourists from Yongding, Singapore, who were visiting China.

The sightseeing group, consisting of 47 people, arrived in Xiayang Town on June 6 at the invitation of the Yongding County Government in Fujian Province. At that time, the Beijing disturbance had just been quelled, and there were many rumors circulating overseas. Relatives of the tourists were worried and repeatedly called to urge them to return quickly. During their sightseeing, the Singapore tourists saw that the situation in their ancestral hometown was stable. Thousands of people welcomed them with singing and dancing. Huang Changxi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, and Zheng Lin, Secretary of the Longyan Municipal Committee, both assured them that the Chinese government had the ability to quickly stabilize the situation. The Singapore tourists were particularly excited and followed the schedule to sightsee and travel, calling their overseas relatives to reassure them.

　　一路顺风　报平安
    “祖家政局平稳，社会安定，全体观光团员平安，请海外亲人放宽心。”这是新加坡永定人士中国观光团的客人给海外亲人的电话。
    观光团一行47人，应福建省永定县政府邀请，于6月6日到达下洋镇。其时，北京刚平息暴乱，海外谣传很多。观光团的亲属忧心忡忡，不断来电催促他们速返。新加坡客人在观光期间，看到祖籍地局势稳定，数千群众载歌载舞热烈欢迎他们。福建省人大常委会副主任黄长溪和龙岩地委书记郑霖都告诉他们，我国政府有能力迅速稳定秩序。新加坡客人一路上格外兴奋，按计划观光旅游，纷纷电请海外亲属放心。
