East Berlin, September 16 (Reported by Xǔ Hóngzhì) - The Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Sin­demann, sent a letter to Professor Emke, the deputy chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group, announcing the cancellation of the planned visit by the West German SPD parliamentary group, led by Emke, to the GDR from September 18 to 20.

According to a report by the German News Agency, Sin­demann stated in his letter that Emke's remarks at a press conference on September 14 and the speech by SPD Chairman Vogel in the Federal Parliament on the same day violated the consensus reached between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany to struggle for security and peace. In terms of form, these statements were insulting and provocative. Therefore, conducting such a visit at this time would not help achieve the goal of peace, security, and equal cooperation between the two Germanys through dialogue and consensus, but would only increase antagonism.

　　民德取消西德社民党议会党团代表团访问
    本报柏林9月16日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国人民议院主席辛德曼昨天致函西德社会民主党联邦议会党团副主席埃姆克教授，宣布取消原定于9月18至20日进行的以埃姆克为团长的西德社民党联邦议会党团代表团对民德的访问。
    据德通社报道，辛德曼在信中指出，埃姆克14日在记者招待会上的讲话以及社民党主席福格尔14日在联邦议会上的讲话违反了统一社会党和社会民主党所达成的必须为安全、和平而斗争的一致意见，在形式上是侮辱性和挑衅性的。因此，现在进行这样的访问无助于实现为了和平、安全以及两个德国之间的平等合作，通过对话取得一致的目的，而只能增加对立情绪。
