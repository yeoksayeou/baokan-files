The ancient city of Yueyang, once renowned for its "Dongting Lake, the water of the world, and Yueyang Tower, the tower of the world," is now rapidly rising in the era of reform and opening up, becoming a "pearl of Dongting Lake."

Yueyang is located at the confluence of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, and the Jingguang Railway, and at the junction of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. It is the only city in Hunan Province that borders the Yangtze River and the sea, with geographical, transportation, and resource advantages for developing external economies. In 1979, Yueyang was designated as one of China's open cities. The people of Yueyang "stepped out of Yueyang to see Yueyang," establishing a development path for external economies with the principle of "using exports to promote imports, using imports to boost exports, pushing forward in both directions, and creating a virtuous cycle." Currently, Yueyang has established multi-level and multi-form economic, technological, and information networks and cooperative relationships with 62 countries and regions. It has also formed sister city relationships with Numazu City in Japan and Titusville in the United States. Yueyang has set up 24 "three resources" enterprises and "three-in-one-compensation" projects, introducing 590 technological and equipment items, and utilizing over $500 million in foreign investment. Major projects built primarily through introductions include a 700,000-kilowatt thermal power plant, a 140,000-ton compound feed factory, and a series of agricultural, fishery, and livestock projects. At the same time, 75 export bases for industrial and agricultural products have been expanded and newly built, with over 300 products exported to more than 40 countries and regions.

Opening up to the outside world has promoted development, and Yueyang's economic construction has entered an unprecedented period of development. In 1988, the city's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 6.386 billion yuan, 2.6 times that of 1978. With the support of national and provincial leaders, Hunan's largest petrochemical base has been established. The Balin Petrochemical Company, composed mainly of Changling Refining and Chemical Plant, Yueyang Petrochemical Company, and Dongting Fertilizer Plant, is a nationally large-scale enterprise with an annual output value of over 1.6 billion yuan. Leveraging the lake resources, textile and papermaking bases have been developed. The largest ramie textile factory in Asia and the largest papermaking factory in Hunan Province are located by Dongting Lake in the city. The six counties (cities) and five state-owned farms under the city's jurisdiction have been successively designated as national and provincial comprehensive agricultural commodity bases. Although a major disaster struck last year, the commodity rate of agricultural products in the city still reached 56%. Urban construction is changing rapidly. In the past four years, 700 million yuan has been invested to renovate 193 scenic spots, including Yueyang Tower, Junshan, and Qu Yuan Temple. Three streets with traditional artistic styles and a number of modern buildings have been built, blending harmoniously with the lake and mountains, making Yueyang even more vibrant and attractive, drawing numerous domestic and foreign businesspeople and tourists. Since the opening up, more than 10,000 overseas and Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao tourism groups have visited Yueyang. Many foreign businesspeople have praised Yueyang, saying, "Yueyang is not only a scenic spot but also an ideal place for investment."

Currently, Yueyang is accelerating the construction of the Chenglingji Foreign Trade Wharf, a 10,000-line program-controlled telephone system, and the Yueyang Railway Station to further open the northern gate of Hunan and promote economic takeoff.

    古城岳阳焕发青春
    昔日，岳阳以“洞庭天下水、岳阳天下楼”闻名于世。如今，这座古城在改革开放中迅速崛起，成为“洞庭明珠”。
    岳阳位于长江、洞庭湖、京广铁路的汇合处和湘鄂赣三省的交界点，是湖南省唯一临江达海的城市，有着发展对外经济的地理、交通和资源优势。1979年，岳阳被列为全国对外开放城市后，岳阳人“跳出岳阳看岳阳”，确立了“以出养进，以进促出，双向推进，良性循环”发展对外经济的路子，目前已与62个国家（地区）建立起多层次、多形式的经济技术信息网络和协作关系，并与日本沼津市、美国的泰特斯威尔市结为友好城市；兴办“三资”企业和“三来一补”项目24个，引进技术、设备590项（套），利用外资5亿多美元。以引进为主兴建的主要项目有：70万千瓦的火力发电厂、年产14万吨的配合饲料厂和一批农、渔、牧等项目。同时，扩大、新建了75个工矿产品和农产品出口基地，有300多种产品销往40多个国家和地区。
    对外开放促进了开发，岳阳的经济建设进入了前所未有的发展时期。1988年，全市工农业总产值达63.86亿元，为1978年的2.6倍。在国家和省的领导支持下，现已建成湖南省最大的石油化工基地，以长岭炼油化工厂、岳阳石油化工总厂、洞庭氮肥厂为主组建的全国特大型企业——巴陵石化公司，年总产值在16亿元以上；依托湖区资源发展了纺织、造纸等基地，亚洲最大的苎麻纺织厂和湖南最大的造纸厂就坐落在城区洞庭湖畔。市辖6
  （县）市和5个国营农场，陆续被定为国、省综合农业商品基地。去年虽遭大灾，全市农产品商品率仍达56％。城市建设日新月异，近四年投资7亿多元，整修了岳阳楼、君山、屈子祠等名胜景点193处，建起了三条具有传统艺术风格的仿古街道和一批现代化建筑，与湖光山色交相辉映，岳阳更加鲜艳夺目，吸引了众多的中外客商游人。自开放以来，仅国外和台港澳来岳阳旅游观光团就有1万多个。不少外商称赞“岳阳既是游览胜地，更是理想的投资场所。”
    目前，岳阳正抓紧建设城陵矶外贸码头、万门程控电话和岳阳火车站，以进一步打开湘北大门，促进经济腾飞。
