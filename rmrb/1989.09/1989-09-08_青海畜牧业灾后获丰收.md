Qinghai's livestock industry has achieved a bumper harvest after suffering from the largest spring snowstorm in history. According to statistics, this year Qinghai Province's pastoral areas have raised 3.386 million young livestock, an increase of 200,000 head compared to the same period last year.

From mid-April to mid-May this year, Qinghai's pastoral areas experienced heavy snowfall, causing severe damage. Starting in June, Qinghai's pastoral areas received above-average rainfall and higher temperatures, resulting in a rare phenomenon of rain and heat occurring simultaneously. The pastoral areas were lush with grass, leading to a higher survival rate for young livestock in the second half of the year.

    青海畜牧业灾后获丰收
    新华社西宁九月八日电（记者陈志强）青海省畜牧业在遭受历史上最大春雪灾害袭击后获得丰收。据统计，今年青海省牧区已育成各类仔畜三百三十八点六万头，比去年同期多成活二十万头。
    今年四月中旬到五月中旬，青海省牧区普降大雪，受灾严重。六月份以后，青海牧区降水偏多，气温升高，出现历史上少有的雨热同步现象，牧区水草丰美，因而下半年仔畜成活率较高。
