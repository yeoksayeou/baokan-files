The cause of death for Yu Dengfa, a prominent figure in Taiwan who formerly served as the magistrate of Kaohsiung County, was determined by Taiwanese authorities on September 14 to be the result of severe blunt force trauma to the head, leading to excessive blood loss. The time of death was confirmed to be September 12.

Based on the forensic re-examination and autopsy report, as well as the lack of obvious signs of forced entry at the crime scene, Taiwanese police deduced that the assailant was likely familiar with the surroundings of Yu Dengfa's residence, allowing them to escape without leaving any traces. Currently, the special investigation team tasked with solving the mysterious death of Yu Dengfa is actively pursuing leads and intensifying efforts to apprehend the culprit.

Yu Dengfa, a native of Kaohsiung County, dedicated his life to local politics. He previously held positions such as a member of the National Assembly, chairman of the Water Resources Association, and the fourth magistrate of Kaohsiung County. He was a staunch opponent of the Kuomintang regime and was imprisoned twice as a result.

He also strongly opposed the advocacy for Taiwan independence and was a notable figure within Taiwan who opposed the "Taiwan independence" movement.

Following the confirmation that Yu Dengfa's death was a homicide, the incident has garnered even more attention and concern in Taiwan.
