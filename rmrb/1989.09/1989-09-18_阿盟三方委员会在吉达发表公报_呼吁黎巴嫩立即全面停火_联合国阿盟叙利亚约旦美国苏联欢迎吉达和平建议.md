The Arab League's three-party committee, tasked with mediating the Lebanese crisis, issued a statement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, yesterday, "calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire across Lebanon." Syria welcomed the statement, and the international community's initial response was positive, while Arab public opinion remained cautious.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal announced the statement at a press conference yesterday afternoon.

The statement contains seven points: immediate and comprehensive ceasefire by all parties; the formation of a Lebanese Security Committee headed by Ibrahim, to oversee the ceasefire and inspect arms ships; lifting the naval blockade and reopening Beirut Airport; halting the use of all types of weapons and ending propaganda warfare; urging relevant countries to stop providing arms; calling for the Lebanese parliament to convene on September 30 to discuss reconciliation documents; and dispatching Ibrahim to Lebanon today to implement the statement's provisions.

This is the latest mediation effort by Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria in response to requests from Arab and other concerned countries to resume mediation work. The foreign ministers of the three countries just concluded a round of meetings in Jeddah. Previously, the three-party committee had announced that mediation efforts had stalled.

The Syrian government issued a formal statement yesterday, welcoming the content of the statement, noting that it "contributes to stopping the Lebanese civil war."

The pro-Syrian Lebanese government of Hussein welcomed the statement and expressed willingness to cooperate. The Oron military government, which is opposed to Syria, stated that if the provisions of the statement are fully implemented, it will execute the ceasefire decision.

The international community's initial response to the statement was positive. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Khaled, praised the statement. Jordanian officials welcomed the Jeddah peace proposal. U.S. President Bush considered the statement a "foundation" for reconciliation among Lebanese factions. The Soviet ambassador to Lebanon hoped that all parties would respond to the statement's ceasefire decision.

Local Arab public opinion is not optimistic, believing that the attitudes of the various Lebanese factions and some Arab countries towards the statement remain to be observed, and that the implementation process will be very difficult. As of the time of this report, small-scale gun battles were still ongoing in Beirut.

Our correspondent reported from the United Nations on September 16: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar issued a statement today, welcoming the Arab League's three-party committee's peace plan to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

    阿盟三方委员会在吉达发表公报
    呼吁黎巴嫩立即全面停火
    联合国阿盟叙利亚约旦美国苏联欢迎吉达和平建议
    本报开罗9月17日电　记者林皎明报道：调解黎巴嫩危机的阿拉伯联盟3方委员会昨天在沙特阿拉伯吉达港发表公报，“呼吁在黎巴嫩全境立即实行全面停火”。叙利亚对此表示欢迎，国际初步反应良好，阿拉伯舆论持谨慎态度。
    沙特外长费萨尔亲王昨天午间在记者招待会上宣布了这一公报。
    公报含7点内容，即：各派立即全面停火；组成以伊卜拉希米为首的黎巴嫩安全委员会，监督停火，检查军火船只；解除海面封锁，开放贝鲁特机场；停止使用各种武器，终止宣传战；呼吁有关国家停止提供军火；呼吁黎议会9月30日开会；商讨和解文件；派伊卜拉希米今天前往黎执行公报条款。
    这是摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯和阿尔及利亚应阿拉伯及世界有关国家要求恢复调解工作的最新调解努力。3国外长在吉达刚刚结束一轮会议。此前，3方委员会曾宣布调解努力搁浅。
    叙利亚政府昨天迅速发表正式声明，欢迎公报内容，指出它“为制止黎巴嫩内战做出贡献”。
    亲叙利亚的黎巴嫩胡斯政府欢迎公报，愿意合作。与叙对立的奥恩军政府则表示，如果公报条款得到全面遵守与实施，它将执行停火决定。
    国际社会对公报的初步反应良好。阿盟秘书长卡利比声明赞赏公报。约旦官员欢迎吉达和平建议。美国总统布什认为公报是黎各派和解的“基础”。苏联驻黎大使希望各派响应公报停火决定。
    此间阿拉伯舆论对此并不乐观，认为黎争端各方及阿拉伯某些国家对公报的态度有待观察，执行过程十分艰难。截至记者发稿时，贝鲁特仍在进行小规模枪战。
    本报联合国9月16日电记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天发表声明，欢迎阿拉伯联盟3方委员会关于解决黎巴嫩危机的和平计划。
