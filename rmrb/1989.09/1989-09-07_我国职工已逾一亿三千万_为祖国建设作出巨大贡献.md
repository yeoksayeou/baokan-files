    China's workforce has surpassed 130 million, making great contributions to national construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 7 (Reporters Li Niangui, Xu Kehong) A group of veteran labor movement workers recently commented: China's workforce has grown stronger and more numerous through reform and opening up, playing an increasingly important role in the country's political, economic, and social life.

    Statistics show that by the end of last year, the number of workers nationwide had reached 136 million, an increase of 41.09 million from 1978, a growth of 43.3%; compared to 1949's 8 million, it has increased by 16 times.

    In China's workforce, 98% joined the workforce after the founding of the nation, and 70% are young and middle-aged workers under the age of 35. They have grown up with New China. They have inherited and carried forward the fine qualities and glorious traditions of the Chinese working class, becoming the main force in socialist economic construction, reform and opening up, and maintaining stability and unity.

    The founding of the People's Republic of China marked a new era in China's history. The Chinese working class, as the masters of the country, have shown the spirit of putting the overall situation first, taking on heavy responsibilities, and the practical spirit of overcoming difficulties and creating businesses. They have the spirit of contribution and do not compare rewards. Together with the people of the whole country, they have healed the wounds of war, rapidly restored the national economy, and established the socialist system. With the development of the national economy, from 1950 to 1988, the cumulative fixed asset investment of state-owned enterprises reached over 215 billion yuan, and 4,390 large and medium-sized projects were completed and put into production. This has laid a relatively solid material and technological foundation for the development of productive forces, the establishment of a complete industrial system, and the improvement of people's lives. In these forty years of construction, the Chinese working class, with their hard work, has developed metallurgy, machinery, light industry, textiles, and other industries at an unprecedented speed, increasing the production of coal, electricity, steel, textiles, and other products by several times to several dozen times compared to the early days of the founding of the nation. Steel production increased from 158,000 tons to 59.18 million tons, rising from the 26th in the world to the 4th; raw coal increased from 32 million tons to 970 million tons; cotton yarn and bicycles ranked first in the world. Industries that did not exist in the old China quickly realized a breakthrough from zero and flourished. China has independently designed and manufactured fighter jets, bombers, attack aircraft, helicopters, transport aircraft, and the first atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, and missile have all been successfully tested. Artificial earth satellites were launched from Chinese soil into space, and Chinese-brand heavy trucks, passenger cars, and light vehicles have successively come into being. All of these are the crystallizations of the wisdom of millions of industrial workers and technicians. People will never forget that China's petroleum workers, with the sky above their heads and the wilderness beneath their feet, took the Daqing Oil Field in one fell swoop, ending China's history of using "foreign oil." For the prosperity of the nation and the interests of the people, the Chinese working class has always been willing to make necessary sacrifices, march forward, and scale new heights.

    The Chinese working class is the most conscious class. They not only created enormous material wealth for the motherland and the people but also created enormous spiritual wealth in promoting socialist spiritual civilization and purifying social customs. They have produced batch after batch of advanced model figures. The 1950s had Meng Tai and Wang Chonglun; the 1960s had the "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi and the "Good Daughter of the Party" Zhao Mengtao; the 1970s had Hou Zhanyou, and so on, who are still models to inspire people today. Since the reform and opening up, China has produced more than 800 new-generation national labor models among industrial workers.

    In the growing and strengthening Chinese working class, the role of female workers is particularly noteworthy. Now, in every 100 workers in China, 37 are women. By the end of last year, the total number of female workers had reached 50.36 million, 75 times that of the early days of the founding of the nation. These female workers are most widely distributed in the fields of health, sports, and welfare, with more than male workers. Next are the service industry, public welfare, commerce, industry, culture and education, finance, and science and technology, where the proportion of female workers exceeds 1/3.

### 我国职工已逾一亿三千万  为祖国建设作出巨大贡献

    我国职工已逾一亿三千万
    为祖国建设作出巨大贡献
    新华社北京9月7日电　（记者李年贵、徐克洪）我国一批老资格工运工作者日前发表评述：中国职工队伍在改革开放中不断发展壮大，在国家的政治、经济和社会生活中正日益发挥着越来越重要的作用。
    据统计，到去年底，全国职工人数已达1.36亿多人，比1978年增加4109万人，增长43.3％；比1949年的800万人增加了16倍。
    在我国的职工队伍中，98％是建国后参加工作的，35岁以下的中青年工人占到70％。他们是和新中国一起成长起来的。他们继承和发扬了中国工人阶级的优秀品德和光荣传统，成为社会主义经济建设、改革开放和维护安定团结的主力军。
    中华人民共和国的成立，开创了我国历史的新纪元。当家作主的中国工人阶级发扬顾全大局、勇挑重担的主人翁精神，知难而上、艰苦创业的实干精神，讲贡献、不比报酬的奉献精神，同全国人民一起医治了战争创伤，迅速恢复了国民经济，确立了社会主义制度。随着国民经济的发展，从1950年到1988年，我国全民所有制单位固定资产投资累计达21500多亿元，建成投产的大中型项目4390多个，为发展社会生产力，建立完整的工业体系，改善人民生活，奠定了比较雄厚的物质技术基础。在这四十年的建设中，中国工人阶级用自己的辛勤劳动，以前所未有的速度发展了冶金、机械、轻工、纺织等工业，使煤、电、钢铁、纺织等产品产量比建国初期增长了数倍至几十倍。其中钢产量从15.8万吨增加到5918万吨，由世界第26位跃居为第4位；原煤由3200万吨增加到9.7亿吨；棉纱、自行车的产量位居世界榜首。旧中国没有的工业也很快实现了零的突破，蓬勃兴起。我国自己设计制造出歼击机、轰炸机、强击机、直升机、运输机，我国第一颗原子弹、氢弹、导弹先后试验成功，人造地球卫星从中国土地上送上了太空，中国牌的载重汽车、小轿车、轻型车相继问世，这全部是亿万产业工人和技术人员智慧的结晶。人们更不会忘记，我国石油工人“头顶青天，脚踏荒原”，一举拿下了大庆油田，结束了中国使用“洋油”的历史。为了国家的富强，为了人民的利益，中国工人阶级总是勇于作出必要的牺牲，踏征途，攀高峰。
    中国工人阶级是最有觉悟的阶级。他们不仅为祖国和人民创造了巨大的物质财富，也在弘扬社会主义精神文明，净化社会风气方面创造了巨大的精神财富。他们中涌现出了一批又一批先进模范人物。五十年代的孟泰、王崇伦，六十年代的“铁人”王进喜、“党的好女儿”赵梦桃；七十年代的侯占友等等至今仍是激励人们的楷模。改革开放以来，我国又在产业工人中涌现出了800多名新一代全国劳动模范。
    在成长壮大的中国工人阶级队伍中，女职工的作用特别引人瞩目。如今，我国每一百名职工中就有37个是妇女。到去年年底，女职工总数已达5036万人，是建国初期的75倍。这些女职工在卫生、体育和福利事业中分布最广，人数超过男职工。其次是服务业、公共事业、商业、工业、文化教育、金融和科技行业，女职工比重都超过了1／3。
