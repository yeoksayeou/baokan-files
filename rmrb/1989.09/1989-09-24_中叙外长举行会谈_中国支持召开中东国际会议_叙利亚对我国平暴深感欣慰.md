Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, September 23rd.

Yesterday afternoon, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in a friendly and sincere atmosphere. The two sides exchanged views on international and Middle East situations, the Lebanese issue, bilateral relations, and matters of concern to both countries.

Qian emphasized that China supports the just struggle of the Arab and Palestinian peoples and condemns Israel's policy of aggression and expansion. China supports the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the Security Council, with the participation of permanent members and relevant parties, to justly, reasonably, and comprehensively resolve the Middle East issue. He said, "Israel can only guarantee its own security by stopping its suppression of the Palestinian people and withdrawing from the Arab territories it has occupied. Achieving peace in the Middle East is a long-term process, and all measures should be taken to promote the Middle East peace process."

Qian expressed concern over the developments in Lebanon, stating, "We advocate maintaining Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We support the mediation efforts of the Arab League's three-party committee and hope that these efforts will yield positive results."

Qian also briefed the situation regarding China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He stressed that the current situation in China is stable, and China's independent and peaceful foreign policy and reform and opening-up policy will not change.

Sharaa expressed his satisfaction with China's successful suppression of the rebellion in June. He said that the Syrian leadership fully understands the measures taken by the Chinese leadership to safeguard the interests of the Chinese people. He pointed out that some countries have blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs. The facts show that foreign forces were involved behind the scenes, aiming to achieve political goals of changing China's social system.

Both sides highly praised the development of Sino-Syrian relations. Sharaa said that the Syrian government has always valued its friendship with China and attaches great importance to Qian's visit. He believes that the meeting between the two foreign ministers will strengthen the development of friendly relations between the two countries.

Qian said that this visit has played a positive role in promoting the development of relations and mutual understanding between the two countries.

Finally, Qian invited Sharaa to visit China. Sharaa gladly accepted the invitation and hoped to visit as soon as possible.

    本报大马士革9月23日电  记者吕志星报道：昨天下午，中国外长钱其琛同叙利亚外长沙雷在友好诚挚的气氛中举行了会谈。双方就国际和中东形势、黎巴嫩问题、双边关系及两国所关心的问题交换了意见。
    钱外长重申，中国支持阿拉伯和巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，谴责以色列的侵略扩张政策。中国支持召开由安理会主持的由常任理事国和有关方面参加的国际会议，公正、合理、全面地解决中东问题。他说，以色列只有停止对巴勒斯坦人民的镇压，撤出它所占领的阿拉伯国家领土，才能保障自己的安全。实现中东和平是一个长期的过程，应采取一切措施推动中东和平进程。
    钱外长对黎局势的发展表示关心，他说，我们主张维护黎的独立主权和领土完整。我们支持阿盟3方委员会的调解活动，希望这种努力取得积极的结果。
    钱外长还介绍了我国平息反革命暴乱的情况。他强调指出，当前我国的形势稳定，我国的独立自主的和平外交政策和改革开放政策不会改变。
    沙雷外长表示，对今年6月中国成功地平息暴乱深感欣慰。叙利亚领导人对中国领导人为维护中国人民的利益所采取的措施完全理解。他指出，情况表明有些国家明目张胆地干涉了中国的内政。事实证明，学生首领的背后有外国势力的插手，企图达到改变中国社会制度的政治目的。
    双方高度赞扬中叙两国关系的发展。沙雷外长说，叙利亚政府一贯珍视同中国的友谊，十分重视钱外长的来访，相信两国外长的会晤将加强两国友好关系的发展。
    钱外长表示，这次访问对推动两国关系的发展和相互了解起了积极的作用。
