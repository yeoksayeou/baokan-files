Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, September 15th.

The Arab Three-Party Committee has resumed its mediation efforts in Lebanon's conflict just as Syrian forces stationed in Lebanon engaged in artillery battles with Lebanese Christian militias today.

This latest round of fighting was initiated by Syrian forces, who launched a heavy barrage of howitzers at the port controlled by Lebanese Christian forces late on the 14th. The Christian militias retaliated, resulting in 5 deaths and 7 injuries. Since March 8th, the death toll has risen to 900, with an additional 2,559 injured.

This artillery exchange occurred shortly after the foreign ministers of the Arab Three-Party Committee concluded their meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the resolution of the Lebanese crisis.

Both Syria and its supported Lebanese Muslim and Christian factions have expressed their approval and support for the resumption of the Three-Party Committee's mediation efforts.
