In the first half of this year, the number of divorce cases accepted by courts at all levels across the country increased by 16.1 percent compared to the same period last year, reaching 378,407 cases. This accounts for 85.9 percent of all marital and family cases.

According to relevant departments of the Supreme People's Court, several new trends have emerged in marital and family cases. Firstly, the proportion of women initiating divorce has increased, generally accounting for more than 60 percent of divorce cases, and in some places, this figure reaches 80 percent. This reflects women's growing independence in the family and their reduced dependence on men. Secondly, the majority of divorces involve middle-aged and young people, accounting for about 70 percent of the cases, with workers and farmers making up a significant portion. Thirdly, there has been an increase in the number of wealthy individual business owners seeking divorce. Lastly, there is also a growing trend of elderly people seeking divorce.

In analyzing the reasons for the increase in divorce cases, relevant departments of the Supreme People's Court believe that, on one hand, the Marriage Law is becoming more widely known, and more people are seeking marriages based on emotion. Some parties to divorce cases want to end marriages that lack emotional foundation. On the other hand, there has been an increase in cases of hasty marriages leading to hasty divorces, as well as divorces due to one party's alcoholism, gambling, or extramarital affairs. The relevant departments of the Supreme People's Court emphasized that the people's courts handle divorce cases by upholding the principle of freedom to divorce while opposing the misuse of this freedom. They emphasize fact-finding, distinguishing right from wrong, and focusing on mediation. Whether to grant or deny a divorce is based on whether the marital relationship has indeed broken down, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Marriage Law.

    法院收受离婚案增加
    据新华社北京九月三日电　（记者周立宪）今年上半年，全国各级法院收受的离婚案件比去年同期增加百分之十六点一，达三十七万八千四百零七件，占全部婚姻家庭案件的百分之八十五点九。
    据最高人民法院有关部门介绍，目前婚姻家庭案件出现了一些新的特点，其中离婚案件中女方提出离婚的比例增高，一般占离婚案件的百分之六十以上，有的地方高达百分之八十。这种情况主要体现了妇女在家庭中地位的进一步独立，基本上摆脱了对男方的依附。其次是中青年离婚的多，比例约占百分之七十，以工人、农民占较大比重。第三个特点是富裕的个体经营户要求离婚的人数增多，第四个特点是老年人要求离婚的也有增多趋势。
    最高人民法院有关部门在分析离婚案件上升的原因时认为，一方面婚姻法越来越普及，追求以感情为基础的婚姻的人越来越多，一些离婚当事人要求结束没有感情的婚姻；另一方面因违法结婚、草率结婚而导致草率离婚的当事人有所增加，而因一方当事人酗酒、赌博、婚外恋而引起离婚的也有所增加。最高人民法院有关部门强调指出，人民法院处理离婚案既依法坚持离婚自由，又反对错误地理解和滥用离婚自由；坚持查明事实，分清是非，着重进行调解。准予或不准予离婚，均依照婚姻法有关规定，以夫妻感情是否确已破裂为根据。
