People's Daily, Beijing, September 25th.

Today, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense invited former central leaders who had led the national defense industry, as well as old comrades and experts who had served in leadership roles in national defense science and technology, along with responsible officials from relevant departments, commissions, and military branches, totaling over 150 people, to gather and review the glorious 40-year journey of national defense science and technology. They expressed their determination to work together to maintain the good momentum of development in the national defense industry.

Party, government, and military leaders Wang Zhen, Li Tieying, Song Renqiong, Zhang Aiping, Zheng Tianxiang, Hong Xuezhi, and Liu Huaqing, along with renowned scientist Qian Xuesen, attended the meeting. Nie Rongzhen sent a letter of congratulations.

In his letter, Nie Rongzhen said, "The 40 years of development in national defense science and technology have been a journey of twists and turns, hardships, and excitement. Everyone will naturally recall the arduous journey we have traversed. The reason we have today's achievements is mainly due to the correct leadership of our Party and the superiority of the socialist political and economic system. Combined with our nation's fine traditions and the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, cooperation, and selfless dedication among all comrades, we have achieved great success. I still remember the 1960s when, through the hard work of comrades, we overcame numerous difficulties and finally succeeded in launching our own 'two bombs, one satellite,' which shocked the world and brought joy to the nation. I sincerely pay tribute and express my gratitude to all comrades, both within and outside the military, who have created brilliant achievements for China's national defense science and technology. It is their hard work that has strengthened our national defense, enhanced our international status, improved our economic production capacity, and expanded our scientific and technological workforce. In short, it has brought about a series of positive changes."

Nie Rongzhen wrote in his letter, "We are now facing severe challenges. In the future, we will need more leadership and support from the Party and the government, more support from the people of the entire nation, and more united efforts and hard work from all of us. Nie Rongzhen concluded his letter with a poem to wish everyone a happy National Day: 'What do you seek on this festive day? Reflecting on the past and looking to the future. Always strive together, and how can we not have faith in the heavens!'"

Wang Zhen spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that in the 40 years since the founding of New China, our national defense science and technology industry has made tremendous contributions to the country's national defense and economic construction. In particular, relying on our own strength, we have not only successfully developed various advanced conventional weapons but also broken through key technologies such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, strategic missiles, satellites, and nuclear submarines. This has greatly enhanced our national defense capabilities and raised our international status. This achievement is the result of the hard work and indelible contributions of all comrades in the national defense science and technology industry, especially the old comrades present today. The Republic will never forget your great achievements.

Wang Zhen also emphasized in his speech that leaders and party organizations at all levels in the national defense science and technology sector should respect intellectuals and create good conditions for them to make greater contributions to the country.

Liu Huaqing, on behalf of the Central Military Commission, expressed his thanks to the old comrades present.

The meeting concluded with everyone singing "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China."

    国防科技四十年业绩辉煌
    专家功臣聚一堂共话艰辛
    本报北京9月25日讯　记者何黄彪报道：今天，国防科工委邀请曾经领导过国防工业的中央领导同志及担任过国防科技工业领导工作的老同志、老专家，和各有关部委和总部、军兵种的负责同志，共150多人，欢聚一堂，共同回顾国防科技工业40年的光辉历程，表示要为保持国防工业良好的发展势头而团结奋斗。
    党政军领导人王震、李铁映、宋任穷、张爱萍、郑天翔、洪学智、刘华清，著名科学家钱学森等出席了会议。聂荣臻同志写信表示祝贺。
    聂荣臻同志在信中说，国防科技工业发展的40年，是经历了一个曲折艰难而又激动人心的40年。大家自然会回想起已走过的这段艰难历程。之所以有今天喜人的成绩，我想最主要的是由于我们党的英明正确的领导和社会主义的政治经济制度的优越性。再加上我们民族的优良传统，全体同志的自力更生、艰苦奋斗、大力协同、无私奉献的精神。我至今犹记着六十年代，经过同志们的艰苦奋斗，克服重重困难，终于使我们自己研制的“两弹”飞爆、一星上天，从而震惊中外、举国欢腾时的动人情景。我衷心地向为我国国防科技工业创造出辉煌业绩的军内外所有同志们致敬致谢。正是这些同志的辛勤劳动，使我国威军威大振，使我国际地位提高，使我经济生产能力增强，使我科技工业技术队伍壮大，……总之，带来一系列积极的变化。
    聂帅在信中说，我们正面临着严峻的挑战。今后，更需要党和政府的领导和支持，更需要全国人民的支援，更需要自己所有同志的齐心协力，艰苦奋斗。聂帅最后赠诗祝同志们国庆欢快：佳节何所求，回顾展望中。埋头常共勉，岂无信天游！
    王震同志在会上讲了话。他指出，新中国成立40年来，我国国防科技工业为祖国国防建设和经济建设，作出了巨大的贡献。特别是我国依靠自己的力量，不仅研制成功了各种先进的常规武器，而且成功地突破了原子弹、氢弹、战略导弹、卫星和核潜艇等尖端技术难关，大大增强了我国的国防力量，提高了我国的国际地位。这里面，凝聚了国防科技工业战线全体同志，特别是今天在座的老同志的辛勤劳动和不朽贡献。共和国永远不会忘记你们的丰功伟绩。
    王震在讲话中还特别要求，国防科技战线各级领导和党组织要尊重知识分子，为他们创造各种良好条件，使他们为祖国作出更大的贡献。
    刘华清代表中央军委向在座的老同志表示感谢。
    会议在高唱《没有共产党就没有新中国》的歌声中结束。
