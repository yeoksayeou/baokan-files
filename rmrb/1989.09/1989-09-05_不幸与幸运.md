    Misfortune and Fortune
    Chongqing Longshou Chemical Plant, Tan Shiliang

    The greatest misfortune in life is to lose a pair of healthy legs from a young age. However, whenever I recall the events of my 33 years of life, my heart feels warm.

    According to the elders, perhaps it was because our Tan family's ancestral graves were not properly buried, or perhaps our ancestors had done something wrong, leaving behind my third uncle and me, two "living treasures." However, because we two lived in two completely different societies, it formed a stark contrast.

    Before liberation, my third uncle suffered from hemiplegia. At that time, poor families struggled to feed themselves, let alone someone like my third uncle who was crippled. To survive, my poor third uncle had to drag his sick body up the mountains to clear land and farm. When faced with droughts or floods, he had no choice but to beg on the streets. It wasn't until he was in his thirties that he barely managed to marry and have a son. But the good times didn't last long. Unable to endure the hardships of poverty, my third aunt left him and their young son. Poor third uncle, busy and hardworking, in the end, could only be wrapped in a yellow mat.

    Every time my mother talked about these past events, I couldn't help but feel a bit sad. However, thinking about my own life, I always felt especially warm. It was truly like one in hell and one in heaven.

    I was eight months old when I contracted polio, which left my legs paralyzed. But my parents did not abandon me because of this. Every time new clothes were sewn, there was always a share for me; every time there was something good to eat, I always got more.

    In school, among the teachers and classmates, I seemed to live in a warm big family.

    I will never forget the first lesson. When the teacher finished telling the story of "Uncle Lei Feng," the classmates started chatting excitedly. They all wanted to help me. The teacher smiled, and I cried. From then on, through many hot summers and cold winters, my classmates carried me to school and back, carried me to the movie theater, and to the library.

    I will never forget the copy of "How the Steel Was Tempered" that my teacher personally gave me; I will never forget the red scarf she tied on me. I was a barren land, and she was like a pioneer, watering it with her sweat; I was a tender sprout, and she was like a gardener, nurturing it with her warmth; I was a hungry little bird, and she was like a mother, feeding me with the milk of knowledge. When I held the red "Certificate of Graduation from a Higher Education Institution in the People's Republic of China" in my hands, I couldn't help but shed tears of happiness and gratitude!

    Now, I have joined the workforce and become someone who not only can support myself but also can contribute to society. I also have a loving wife and a lovely daughter. The whole family respects the elderly and loves the young, living harmoniously. We have bought a color TV and a refrigerator, and we have moved into a new house. All of this, I'm sure my third uncle never even dreamed of.

    不幸与幸运
    重庆市长寿化工总厂　谭诗亮
    人生最大的不幸，莫过于从小就失去一双健康的腿。然而，每当我回忆起这33年的生活往事，心里总是暖融融的。
    据老人们说：也许是我们谭家的祖坟没埋好，或者是祖辈们造了孽，遗下了我的三伯和我这两个“现世宝”。可是，由于我们爷儿俩生活在两个迥然不同的社会里，恰好形成鲜明的对比。
    解放前，我的三伯患了半身不遂。那时候，穷苦人家，好脚好手、身强力壮的汉子求一点温饱尚不可得，何况我三伯？为了活命，可怜的三伯也只得拖着残身病体，一步一挪地上山开荒种地。遇上天旱水涝，就只好沿街乞讨了。直到三十好几，他才勉强娶了个媳妇，生了个儿子。但“好景”不长，由于经受不住穷苦生活的煎熬，我三妈撇开三伯和幼子走了。可怜我的三伯，忙忙碌碌，累死累活，到头来也只落得黄席裹身。
    每每听到母亲谈起这些往事，我总不禁有些黯然。然而，联想自己的生活情景，又总感到格外的温暖。真是一个在地狱，一个在天堂。
    我出生8个月的时候，因患小儿麻痹症致使双腿瘫痪。但父母并没因此而嫌弃我。每次缝新衣，总有我的份；每次吃好的，总是我多些。
    在学校，在老师和同学们中间，我仿佛生活在一个温暖的大家庭里。
    我忘不了，第一堂课，当老师讲的“雷锋叔叔的故事”一完，同学们就叽叽喳喳地议论起来，他们争着要帮助我。老师笑了，我却哭了。从此，多少个酷暑，多少个严冬，同学们背着我上学，放学，背着我上电影院、进图书馆。
    我忘不了，老师亲手赠给我的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》；我忘不了，她亲手给我系上的红领巾。我是一片贫瘠的土地，她像拓荒者一样，用辛勤的汗水浇洒；我是一株嫩弱的幼芽，她像园丁一样，用抚爱的温暖催发；我是一只嗷嗷待哺的小鸟，她像母亲一样，用知识的乳汁哺育。当我双手捧着红彤彤的“中华人民共和国高等学校毕业证书”时，我禁不住流下了热泪，这是幸福的泪，感激的泪！
    如今，我参加了工作，成了一个不仅能自食其力，而且能对社会尽义务的人。我也娶了爱妻，有了娇女。全家人敬老爱幼，和和睦睦。家里还买了彩电、冰箱，并且搬进了新房。这一切，我三伯恐怕是想都不曾想过的。
