The spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Tang Shubei, today told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that in recent years, several issues have emerged in the exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He said that since the exchanges have developed compared to before, it is not surprising that various specific issues have arisen and will continue to arise. He pointed out that the existence of many problems or the inability to resolve them in a timely manner is mainly due to the inability of the two sides of the Strait to directly implement the "three links" as well as the Kuomintang's "three nos" policy. He said that it is well known that we have long advocated for the early direct contact between the two parties, and it is also possible to first consult on specific issues in the cross-strait relations.

Tang Shubei then discussed several specific issues that have arisen during the exchanges between the two sides:

1. Regarding the issue of whether there have been changes in the visa procedures for Taiwanese entering the mainland. He said that the visa authorities have always facilitated the entry and exit procedures for Taiwanese coming to the mainland to visit relatives, travel, invest, do business, and engage in various exchanges. The consular and visa authorities abroad have issued travel documents to Taiwanese based on their actual needs, and this method has not changed. Some Taiwanese media have reported that the visa procedures for Taiwanese entering the mainland have changed, which is unfounded. If there is any "tightening," it is the Taiwanese authorities. Although in recent years, the Taiwanese authorities have slightly relaxed some restrictions on mainland Taiwanese going to Taiwan for funerals and visiting relatives, they still impose a large number of unreasonable restrictions. Since the end of 1987, more than 800,000 Taiwanese have come to the mainland to visit relatives and travel, while only over 2,000 mainlanders have been allowed to go to Taiwan to visit relatives and attend funerals, which is the best evidence.

2. Regarding the issue of the Taiwanese side conducting reactionary propaganda in telephone and mail communications. Tang Shubei said that the postal and telecommunications authorities unilaterally opened some postal and telecommunications services with Taiwan in 1979. However, the Taiwanese authorities insist on the "three nos" and refuse to communicate by mail. In June this year, the Taiwanese authorities suddenly opened indirect telephone and mail communications. Among the letters sent, there were reactionary propaganda materials, "psychological warfare" items, and postcards supporting the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. Some had political propaganda slogans printed on the envelopes, some used stamps with anti-communist content, and some transmitted reactionary propaganda materials through user telegrams.

He said that we believe that the relevant parties in Taiwan, through normal postal and telecommunications communications between the people of the two sides of the Strait, use the above methods to conduct reactionary propaganda. The consequences will inevitably be to destroy the harmonious atmosphere of communication between relatives on both sides and create tension in cross-strait relations. This has already caused serious concern among the vast number of Taiwanese compatriots and relatives, and they have condemned it. The relevant parties in Taiwan should immediately stop all these extremely unwise actions.

3. Regarding the issue of Taiwanese bringing Renminbi into the country. He pointed out that according to government regulations, Renminbi is prohibited from being carried out of or into the country. Violators will have their currency confiscated. Now, some lawbreakers are smuggling large amounts of Renminbi out of the country for illegal trading. We have taken measures to prevent Renminbi from being smuggled out of the country.

We hope that Taiwanese compatriots will abide by the national regulations, not be deceived, and not exchange Renminbi from abroad to bring into the country.

4. Regarding the recent issue of "mainland girls" in Taiwan. Tang Shubei said that some young women have been kidnapped by human traffickers to Taiwan and forced into prostitution, facing a miserable situation. The relevant authorities in Taiwan should severely punish these human traffickers to prevent similar incidents from happening. He expressed his thanks to the Taiwanese compatriots and fair public opinion for their concern and help for these mainland sisters who were kidnapped to Taiwan.

5. Regarding the issue of preventing the smuggling of precious wild animals to Taiwan, Tang Shubei reiterated the ban on the smuggling of precious wild animals out of the country. He said that according to the "Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China," those who smuggle precious wild animals will be subject to criminal penalties.

6. Regarding the issue of whether the mainland government allows the dispatch of labor to Taiwan. He pointed out that the two sides need to cooperate with each other and jointly develop the national economy to improve the living standards of the people and build China into a prosperous and strong modernized country.

In terms of labor cooperation between the two sides of the Strait, we hold the same attitude. The key now lies in the policy of the Taiwanese authorities. Of course, we oppose the private and blind flow of people to Taiwan.

7. Regarding the issue of the three mainland crew members on the "Dongqun" fishing boat being sent to Taiwan for trial. Tang Shubei pointed out that there were a total of 8 mainland crew members working on the "Dongqun" boat. They went on board to fulfill the labor contract signed by the Mauritius Meimei Shipping Company and our Fuzhou Municipal International Economic and Technical Cooperation Company. Some of them are suspected of murder, and the relevant authorities in Taiwan should send them back to the mainland. Our judicial authorities will make a fair and reasonable judgment based on the facts of the crime and the law.

8. Regarding the issue of Taiwan's "flexible diplomacy" and dual recognition. Tang Shubei emphasized that we firmly oppose "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and oppose our diplomatic countries from establishing official relations with Taiwan and conducting official exchanges.

### 国务院台办发言人谈　海峡两岸交流中几个具体问题

　　国务院台办发言人谈
　　海峡两岸交流中几个具体问题
    新华社北京9月15日电　国务院台湾事务办公室副主任、发言人唐树备今天向本社记者谈到台湾海峡两岸近些年来交流中出现的一些问题时说，由于两岸交流比以前有了发展，交流中已经并还将会发生这样那样的一些具体问题。这是不奇怪的。他指出，许多问题的存在或不能及时解决，主要是由于海峡两岸不能直接“三通”以及国民党的“三不”政策所造成的。他说，众所周知，我们早就主张国共两党尽早直接接触，也可以先就两岸关系中的具体问题进行磋商。
    唐树备接着谈到了有关两岸交往过程中出现的几个具体问题：
    一、关于台胞入境的签证办法是否有改变的问题。他说，我签证机关一直为台胞来大陆探亲、旅游、投资、经商和从事各项交流活动，在入出境手续上提供方便。我驻外领事和签证机构，根据台胞的实际需要，颁发旅行证的办法，并没有改变。有的台湾报刊传我改变了台胞入境的签证办法，这是没有根据的。如果存在什么“紧缩”的话，倒是台湾当局。尽管近年来台湾当局在大陆台胞去台奔丧、探亲等方面有了少许松动，但仍作了大量不合情理的限制。从1987年底以来，已有台胞80多万人次来大陆探亲、旅游，而只有两千多大陆同胞获准去台探亲、奔丧，这就是一个最好的说明。
    二、关于台湾方面在通话、通邮中进行反动宣传的问题。唐树备说，我邮电部门1979年单方面开放了与台湾的部分邮电业务。但台湾当局坚持“三不”，拒不通邮。今年6月间，台湾当局突然开放间接通话和通邮。在发来的函件中，夹寄反动宣传品、“心战”品，以及声援北京反革命暴乱的明信片。有些在信封上印有政治宣传口号，有的贴用有反共内容的邮票，还有的通过用户电报，传递反动宣传品。
    他说，我们认为，台湾有关方面通过海峡两岸人民之间正常邮电通信，采取上述手法，进行反动宣传，其后果必然是破坏两岸亲友通邮通电的祥和气氛，在两岸关系上制造紧张。这已经引起广大台胞、台属的严重不安，并纷纷加以谴责。台湾有关方面应当立即停止上述一切极不明智的动作。
    三、关于台胞携带人民币入境问题。他指出，根据政府规定，人民币是禁止携带出境和入境的。违反者，一律没收。现在有些不法分子，把大量人民币偷出境外进行非法倒卖。我们已经采取措施防止人民币被偷运出境。
    我们希望台胞遵守国家规定，不要受骗上当，不要从境外换人民币携带入境。
    四、关于台湾最近出现“大陆妹”问题。唐树备说，一些青年妇女被人口贩子拐骗到台湾逼为娼妓，处境悲惨。台湾有关当局应严惩这些人口贩子，以杜绝类似事件的发生。他表示感谢台湾同胞和公正舆论对被拐骗去台湾的这些大陆骨肉姊妹所给予的关怀和帮助。
    五、关于防止珍贵野生动物被走私到台湾问题，唐树备重申严禁走私珍贵野生动物出境。他说，根据《中华人民共和国野生动物保护法》，走私珍贵野生动物的不法分子将依法受到刑事处分。
    六、关于大陆政府是否允许向台湾派劳务问题。他指出，两岸需要互相合作，共同发展民族经济，以便提高人民生活水平，把中国建设成为一个繁荣富强的现代化国家。
    在海峡两岸的劳务合作方面，我们也持同样的态度。现在的关键在于台湾当局的政策。当然，我们反对少数人私自盲流去台。
    七、关于台湾“东群号”渔船上的三名大陆船员被押送到台湾受审问题。唐树备指出，在“东群号”上工作的大陆船员共有8名，他们是为履行毛里求斯美美船务公司和我福州市国际经济技术合作公司签订的劳务合同而上船的。有人涉嫌凶杀，台湾有关当局应把他们遣返大陆，我司法机关将会根据犯罪事实和法律，对他们作出公正合理的判决。
    八、有关台推行“弹性外交”、搞双重承认问题。唐树备强调，我坚决反对“两个中国”、“一中一台”，反对我建交国与台湾建立官方关系和进行官方往来。
