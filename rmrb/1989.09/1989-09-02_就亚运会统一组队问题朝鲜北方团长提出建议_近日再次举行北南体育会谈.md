North Korea's North-South sports talks resumed recently.

	New China News Agency, Pyongyang, September 1st (Reporter: Lì Néngqīng) The head of the North Korean delegation to the North-South sports talks, Kim Hyong-jin, proposed to the chief representative of the South Korean delegation, Chang Chong-sik, that the third round of North-South sports talks be held on September 13th.

	In a telephone notification to Chang Chong-sik, Kim Hyong-jin pointed out that the North had proposed on August 8th to hold the third round of talks as soon as possible to discuss the issue of forming a unified team from North and South Korea to participate in the 11th Asian Games. However, more than 20 days have passed, and the South has not responded. Considering that there is only one year left until the 11th Asian Games, the North believes that the North-South sports talks cannot be delayed any further. The North hopes that the South will give a positive response to this proposal.

	The proposal for North and South Korea to form a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games was first made by the North on December 21st of last year. The two sides have held two rounds of talks in Panmunjom this year. During the second round of talks, progress was made on issues such as the team flag design.

    就亚运会统一组队问题朝鲜北方团长提出建议
    近日再次举行北南体育会谈
    新华社平壤9月1日电　（记者黎能清）朝鲜北南体育会谈北方代表团团长金亨镇1日向南方代表团首席代表张忠植提出建议，北南第三次体育会谈于9月13日举行。
    金亨镇在给张忠植的电话通知中指出，北方曾在8月8日建议尽早就朝鲜北南双方组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会问题举行第三次会谈。但是，20多天过去了，南方没有作出任何答复。考虑到离第十一届亚运会只有一年时间，北方认为北南体育会谈不能再拖延了。希望南方对北方的这一建议作出肯定的答复。
    北南朝鲜组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会是去年12月21日北方首先提出来的。双方曾于今年3月两次在板门店举行会谈。第二次会谈双方在队旗图案等问题上取得了进展。
