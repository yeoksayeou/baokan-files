In the mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a "steel dragon" winds its way through—the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, with an average elevation of over 3,000 meters. It is the highest railway in China to date and the highest railway line in the world.

In the old society, transportation in Qinghai was extremely backward. As the saying goes, "Clouds obscure the path, making it hard to ride, and deep sand threatens to swallow the car." There wasn't a single mile of railway, and roads were scarce. By 1949, the entire province had only 472 kilometers of roads that could barely accommodate vehicles. After liberation, socialist construction demanded increasingly higher standards for transportation, especially for the national economic artery, the railway. Thus, following the completion of the Lanzhou-Xining Railway on October 1, 1959, the extension westward, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, was put on the agenda.

After 1974, the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway began on the "Roof of the World." Over 50,000 railway soldiers and engineering technicians ventured into the mountains, grasslands, and deserts, overcoming unimaginable difficulties such as high altitude, lack of oxygen, and complex geology. They opened the 4,010-meter-long Guanqiao Tunnel. This tunnel, with a track surface elevation of 3,700 meters, is the highest tunnel in the world. In the vast Chaharhan Salt Lake, the railway soldiers laid 32 kilometers of track on the salt lake, creating a miracle in railway history. The 800-plus kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway to Golmud finally opened fully on May 1, 1984.

In the five years since its opening, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has transported over 500 million tons of various materials, carried 2.03 million passengers, and completed a turnover volume of 5.156 billion ton-kilometers. It has played a significant role in promoting the development of Qinghai and Tibet, especially the development of the Qaidam Basin. The various ethnic groups, looking at this "steel dragon" leaping onto the "Roof of the World," cannot help but praise this great artery as the "Golden Road" and the "Line of Happiness."

### “钢铁长龙”跃上“世界屋脊”

　　“钢铁长龙”跃上“世界屋脊”
    在青藏高原的群山中，逶迤穿行着一条“钢铁长龙”——平均海拔3000多米的青藏铁路。它是我国迄今为止海拔最高的铁路，也是目前世界上海拔最高的铁路干线。
    旧社会的青海交通运输非常落后，人称“云暗难分骑，沙深欲陷车”，不仅没一寸铁路，公路也少得可怜。到1949年，全省能勉强走车的公路只有472公里。解放后，社会主义建设对交通运输尤其是对国民经济大动脉的铁路提出越来越高的要求。于是继1959年10月1日兰青铁路通车后，向西延伸的青藏铁路被提上议事日程。
    1974年以后，青藏铁路的修建在“世界屋脊”拉开序幕。5万多名铁道兵和工程技术人员奔赴深山、草原、戈壁，克服了高寒缺氧、地质复杂等难以想象的困难，开通了4010米长的关角隧道。这条隧道轨面海拔标高3700米，是世界上海拔最高的隧道。在茫茫无际的察尔汗盐湖，铁道兵将32公里长的铁轨铺在盐湖上，创造了世界铁路史上的奇迹。青藏铁路至格尔木段的800余公里，终于在1984年5月1日全线正式通车。
    通车5年来，青藏铁路共发送各类物资500多万吨，运送旅客203万人次，完成周转量51.56亿吨公里，对促进青海、西藏的建设特别是柴达木的开发发挥了巨大作用。各族人民望着这条跃上“世界屋脊”的“钢铁长龙”，情不自禁地称赞这条大动脉是“黄金路”、“幸福线”。　（李向红）
