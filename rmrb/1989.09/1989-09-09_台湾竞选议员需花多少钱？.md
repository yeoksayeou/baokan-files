How much money is needed to run for a legislative seat in Taipei City this year? According to the Taipei-based *Zili Evening News*, based on the assessments of experienced election strategists, at least 15 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) is unavoidable.

The newspaper reports that this 15 million NTD includes 3 million NTD for general expenses and 12 million NTD for "buying votes." The 3 million NTD for general expenses is mainly spent on personnel, entertaining, and publicity. The 12 million NTD for "buying votes" focuses on "spending money where it counts." In addition to finding the right "sellers," the effectiveness also needs to be calculated with a discount.

According to custom, those who deal in votes with candidates include "gang leaders," local chiefs, and "cockroaches." These people are either personally deployed by the candidates or actively approach them. The informal small group leaders known as "cockroaches" have lists of some voters and actively sell votes to candidates to make money. As for the price of votes, it generally ranges from 200 to 300 NTD, but there are differences between new and old votes. Some veteran legislators, due to their stable base, can get by with just 100 NTD per vote as a token. Newcomers, however, might see the price inflated to around 500 NTD.

### 台湾竞选议员需花多少钱？

    台湾竞选议员需花多少钱？
    今年台北市市议员选举，需要耗费多少财力？据台北《自立晚报》根据一些经验老到的选举战将评估，最低一千五百万元（新台币）是跑不掉的。
    该报说，这一千五百万元包括三百万元的一般经费及一千二百万元的
  “买票”开销。三百万元的一般经费，多花在人事、请客和宣传上。一千二百万元的“买票”开销，则着重在“钱花在刀口上”，除了要找对“卖主”，也要将成效打折扣计算。
    按照惯例，与候选人买卖选票的人士有“桩仔脚”、乡里长及“蟑螂”等。这几种人都是由候选人亲自部署或主动交涉；被称为“蟑螂”的非正式团体小头头，握有部分选民的名单，主动找候选人兜售，靠卖选票发财。至于选票的行情，一般在二百至三百元，但有新老之分，部分老议员由于根基稳，每张选票一百元意思意思就可以打发了；新人则有可能被哄抬到五百元左右。
