Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 6th.

The Shanghai Petrochemical Complex, often referred to as the "man-made gold mountain," has cultivated a unique set of values among its workers, known as the "Jinshan Spirit," which emphasizes hard work, scientific realism, unity, and selfless dedication. This spirit has shaped the distinctive value system of the "Jinshan People."

The unique value system of the "Jinshan People" is rooted in a deep understanding of the significant role that large enterprises play in supporting the socialist state. They are willing to endure hardships to contribute more to the nation. Under this guiding principle, the Shanghai Petrochemical Complex exhibits a series of striking contrasts between its contributions and demands.

Contrast one: The "headquarters" of a "billionaire" is located in an office building converted from the initial collective dormitories. Since its operation, the Shanghai Petrochemical Complex has accumulated nearly 10 billion yuan in profits and taxes. This amount could build approximately three railway lines from Beijing to Shanghai. However, the complex has been reluctant to spend money on constructing a new office building. The current office building, though not modern, maintains a tense working atmosphere and high operational efficiency. In recent years, the factory's leadership has consistently pursued both reform and openness while combating corruption and promoting integrity, striving to establish a dignified image of a socialist enterprise.

Contrast two: Among the top 100 largest industrial enterprises in the country, the complex ranks sixth in total tax revenue but last in retained earnings.

Contrast three: The complex strives to be at the forefront of economic performance indicators, but the income level of its employees is average.

Contrast four: The complex receives only about 60% of the raw materials allocated by the state, but it maintains a 100% fulfillment rate for state-mandated supply contracts.

Contrast five: As the enterprise continues to expand and thrive, the majority of employees are willing to endure hardships. After completing the first and second phases of the project, the complex immediately began construction on the third phase and planning for the fourth. The funding for these projects shifted from state allocations to loans and then to self-raised funds. Under these circumstances, the ongoing third-phase project not only fails to provide immediate benefits to the employees but also requires various departments to contribute manpower, financial resources, and materials. The employees, instead of complaining, feel a sense of pride. Communist Party members lead the way by taking turns participating in voluntary labor on the third-phase construction site, and the general workforce follows suit.

### 守着“人造金山”不忘艰苦创业  上海石化总厂多奉献少索取形成强烈反差

    守着“人造金山”不忘艰苦创业
    上海石化总厂多奉献少索取形成强烈反差
    据新华社上海9月6日电  （记者吴复民）被世人喻为“人造金山”的上海石油化工总厂，靠弘扬“艰苦创业、科学求实、团结进取、忘我献身”的“金山精神”，造就了“金山人”独特的价值观念。
    “金山人”独特的价值观念是：深刻认识大型企业对支撑社会主义共和国大厦所肩负的重任，甘愿自讨苦吃，也要对国家多做贡献。在这种观念的支配下，上海石化总厂的奉献与索取形成了一系列反差。
    反差之一：“亿万富翁”的“首脑机关”设在用建厂初期的集体宿舍改造的办公楼里。上海石化总厂投产以来，已累计实现利税近100亿元。用这笔钱约可建造3条北京至上海的铁路干线。但是，它却舍不得拿钱建一幢办公楼。厂部办公楼虽然没有一点“现代派”，却有紧张的工作气氛和较高的办事效率。近几年，这个厂的领导班子一直坚持改革开放与反腐倡廉两手一齐抓，努力树立堂堂正正的社会主义大企业形象。
    反差之二：在全国100家最大工业企业中，利税总额正数第六，而企业留利则倒数第一。
    反差之三：经济效益指标力争上游，而职工收入水平居于中游。
    反差之四：国家提供的指令性原材料一般只能拿到60％，而国家下达的指令性供货合同履约率却保持在100％。
    反差之五：企业不断扩建发展，日益兴旺，而广大职工却甘愿自讨苦吃。这个厂在一、二期工程完成后，又不停顿地投入三期工程的建设和四期工程的规划。而建设资金的来源则由国家拨款改为贷款，又改为自行集资。在这种情况下，当前正进行的三期工程，不仅不能给职工提供眼前的实惠，反而要各单位抽出人、财、物力进行支援。职工们不仅没有怨言，反而感到有一种自豪感，共产党员们带头轮流到三期工程工地参加义务劳动，职工群众也随之响应。
