Chen Junsheng, a member of the State Council, recently emphasized during an inspection of agricultural and pastoral work in Inner Mongolia that the ten years of reform have brought a rising momentum to agricultural and pastoral production. To maintain this momentum and continue development, it is crucial to stabilize the current reform policies.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Inner Mongolia has widely implemented the household contract responsibility system in agricultural and pastoral production. The system of "public ownership of grasslands and farmlands, contracted operation to households, valuation of livestock, and household raising" has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen for production, promoting the development of agriculture and pastoralism, and is widely welcomed by farmers and herdsmen. They generally hope to continue stabilizing this policy. In recent years, on the basis of household contract production and voluntary participation of the masses, they have paid attention to developing appropriate scale operations and specialized production in agriculture and pastoralism. In vast rural and pastoral areas, they have experimented with and promoted a "three-household construction," namely, family ranches, specialized livestock households, agricultural and pastoral integrated households, and scientific and technological service households.

Chen Junsheng, during his inspection, fully affirmed the achievements they have made.

    陈俊生在内蒙古调查时强调
    发展农牧业要稳定政策
    据新华社呼和浩特9月5日电　国务委员陈俊生同志近日在内蒙古调查农牧业工作时强调，十年改革给农牧业生产带来了上升的势头，要保住这个势头，继续发展，关键要稳定现行各项改革政策。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，内蒙古在农牧业生产中普遍推行家庭承包责任制，实行“草田公有，承包到户经营，牲畜作价，户有户养”这一经营形式，极大地调动了农牧民的生产积极性，促进了农牧业的发展，深受农牧民的欢迎。他们普遍希望继续稳定这一政策。近几年来，在家庭联产承包和群众自愿的基础上，他们注意发展农牧业适度规模经营和专业化生产。在广大农村、牧区试验和推广了一场三户建设，即家庭牧场，畜牧业专业户，农牧结合户和科技服务户。
    陈俊生同志在调查中，充分肯定了他们取得的成绩。
