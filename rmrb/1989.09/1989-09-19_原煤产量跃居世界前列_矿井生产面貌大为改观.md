	The People's Daily reports that over the past 40 years, China's coal industry has achieved remarkable results: coal production has risen to one of the highest in the world, and the production conditions in mines have significantly improved.

	In 1949, the year the People's Republic of China was founded, the national coal production was 32.43 million tons, equivalent to the annual production of just one mining bureau, the Datong Mining Bureau, today. By 1988, national coal production had reached 979.8 million tons, a 29-fold increase from 1949. It is estimated that this year's production will exceed 1 billion tons.

	Before 1949, China's coal mines primarily used primitive mining methods. Workers manually drilled holes for explosives, used pickaxes to extract coal, and had low efficiency and poor safety conditions. Today, many mines have adopted mechanized operations. By 1988, nearly 1,000 sets of mechanized coal mining equipment had been installed in national key coal mines. In 21 national key mining bureaus, the mechanization rate of coal mining reached over 70%.

### 原煤产量跃居世界前列　矿井生产面貌大为改观

　　原煤产量跃居世界前列
　　矿井生产面貌大为改观
    本报讯　记者刘燮阳从有关部门获悉：我国煤炭工业40年来，取得举世瞩目成就：原煤产量跃居世界前列，矿井生产面貌有了很大改观。
    新中国成立的1949年，全国煤炭产量为3243万吨，只相当于现在大同矿务局一个局的年产量。到1988年，全国煤产量已达到9.798亿吨，比1949年增长29倍，预计今年可突破10亿吨。
    1949年以前，我国煤矿基本上采用原始的开采方法，人工打眼放炮，手镐刨煤，效率很低，安全生产条件不好。而今，许多矿井都实行了机械化。到1988年，全国统配煤矿装备机械化采煤设备近1000套。全国有21个统配矿务局的采煤机械化程度达到70％以上。
