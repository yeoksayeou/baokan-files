The prospects for Xinjiang's petroleum industry are bright. The production capacity of the old oil fields in Kelamayi is continuously expanding, and petroleum geological exploration in southern and northern Xinjiang has made significant progress, particularly in the Tarim Basin, where a series of major breakthroughs have been achieved. On August 4th and August 16th, two new exploratory wells—Sha 3 and Sha 18—successively gushed high-yield oil and gas. In the 560,000 square kilometer Tarim Basin, these are the 12th and 13th wells to yield industrial oil and gas flows. These achievements demonstrate that the Tarim Basin is a multi-layered, composite-type large oil field.

The original northern Xinjiang petroleum base, the Kelamayi old oil field, which has been developed for over 30 years, is once again vibrant. The crude oil production increased from 3.807 million tons in 1979 to 6.15 million tons in 1988. Over the past 10 years, the newly discovered petroleum reserves are equivalent to 1.3 times the amount of the previous 28 years. The cumulative industrial output value is 11 billion yuan, equivalent to 1.38 times the amount of the previous 28 years. Xinjiang's petroleum industry has now risen to the fifth position nationwide. The fire mountain oil field in the eastern part of the Junggar Basin, which began exploration in 1981, took only 6 years to achieve significant production capacity. By the end of 1988, it was producing over 2,000 tons of crude oil per day, with an annual production of 430,000 tons.

In recent years, petroleum exploration in southern Xinjiang has been intensively carried out. Over 10,000 personnel from the geological and petroleum departments have braved the scorching heat and bitter cold of the desert, working side by side, using relatively advanced exploration technologies. They have preliminarily clarified the geological structure of the basin and some underground concealed structures, identifying several favorable oil-bearing areas. They have drilled 19 exploratory wells in the northern uplift zone, central, and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin, with 13 wells yielding industrial oil and gas flows. Among these, the three oil and gas layers of the Lunan 2 well have a combined daily production of up to 1,500 cubic meters. The continuous breakthroughs in this region not only expanded the oil-bearing area but also yielded high-yield industrial oil and gas flows at different stratigraphic levels. On May 1st of this year, the Tarim 1 well began drilling in the heart of the Taklamakan Desert, marking the first time humans will unveil the geological structure of the desert, known as the "Sea of Death." Chinese and foreign petroleum geologists predict that Tarim is a large sedimentary basin with significant oil and gas potential, with at least 10 billion tons of oil and gas resources.

    新疆石油事业前景喜人
    克拉玛依老油田生产能力不断扩大
    塔里木盆地石油勘探取得重大突破
    新疆的石油事业展现出喜人的前景。克拉玛依老油田生产能力不断扩大，南北疆石油地质勘探有了很大发展，特别是在塔里木盆地取得了一系列重大突破。8月4日、8月16日，两口新的探井——沙3井和沙18井又相继喷出了高产油气流。在方圆56万平方公里的塔里木盆地上，这已是第12、13口井获得了工业油气流。这些成果证明，塔里木盆地是多层组合的复合型大油田。
    原来的北疆石油基地、开发了30多年的克拉玛依老油田又青春焕发，原油产量由1979年的380.7万吨，上升到1988年的615万吨。在近10年中，新探明的石油储量相当于前28年的1.3倍，工业总产值累计110亿元，相当于前28年的1.38倍，新疆石油工业已跃居全国第五位。1981年开始勘探的准噶尔盆地东部火烧山油田，只用了6年时间便形成了相当的生产能力，1988年末，日产原油2000吨以上，年产量达43万吨。
    近年来，南疆石油勘探紧锣密鼓，地矿、石油两部门所属上万人的勘探队伍，冒着大漠的酷暑、严寒，并肩作战，采用较先进的勘探技术，初步查清了盆地的地质构造和地下一些潜伏构造，找到了几个有利的含油地带，先后在塔里木北部的隆起带、塔中和塔东地带上打探井19口，13口井获工业油气流，其中抡南2井三个油气层合采日产高达1500立方。在这一区域的接连突破，不仅扩大了含油面积，而且在不同层位均已获高产工业油气流。今年5月1日，塔中1井在塔克拉玛干沙漠腹地开钻，这标志着人类将首次揭开被称为“死亡之海”的大沙漠地质构造的神秘面纱。中外石油地质专家预测，塔里木是一个具有较大油气远景的沉积盆地，最少有100亿吨的油气储量资源。
