The People's Daily, Pyongyang, September 7th

The raging waters of the Taedong River once submerged the capital city of Pyongyang, even flooding buildings up to the second floor. However, within less than a decade, the once unruly Taedong River was tamed and transformed into a gentle river, becoming a vivid example of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's conquest over nature and its benefits to society.

The Taedong River originates from the mountainous regions in the north of Korea, flows through the capital Pyongyang, and empties into the West Sea of Korea. The management of this river is a source of pride for the Korean people. The primary method they adopted was to build dams across the river. To date, five dams have been constructed along the 450-kilometer-long Taedong River, from upstream to downstream: the Suncheon, Seongcheon, Ponghwa, Mirim, and Sohae Dams. These five dams act like five magical locks, altering the wild nature of the Taedong River and achieving comprehensive economic benefits.

Traveling upstream from Pyongyang along the Taedong River, one soon arrives at the lush Mirim Plain, where the first dam is located. Upon descending from the vehicle, one sees a massive concrete and steel structure spanning the river, an awe-inspiring sight. The dam features a ship lock and more than a dozen floodgates, with a road and pedestrian walkway on top.

Wu Kwang-hyon, the manager of the dam, received us. Pointing to the floodgates, which can withstand a pressure of 18,000 tons, he said, "The primary function of the dam is flood control. Since its construction, there have been no floods."

After the dam was built, a massive artificial lake was formed in the Mirim Plain, now holding one billion cubic meters of water, meeting the industrial and domestic water needs of Pyongyang. Fifty-nine pumping stations were built around the reservoir, significantly expanding the irrigated land area in the Pyongyang region. The wide expanse of water also facilitated the development of aquaculture.

The dam raised the water level of the Taedong River, not only enhancing the scenic beauty along the river but also increasing the capacity for water transportation. Previously, 1,000-ton cargo ships could only navigate during the high water season, but now they can travel freely without the hindrance of shallow waters. Moreover, the five dams have progressively raised the water level, extending the navigable channel. Additionally, the dams serve as bridges connecting the two banks of the Taedong River, making land transportation more convenient.

After touring the above-ground sections, we entered the underground powerhouse. There were 13 generators, each with a capacity of 8,000 watts, but only four were operational due to the non-rainy season. It is said that the Mirim Dam can generate 120 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is supplied to Pyongyang.

Our Korean friends introduced us to the other three dams upstream of the Taedong River, which have similar designs and functions to the Mirim Dam. Among them, the Sohae Dam, the most recently completed, stands out.

To the west of Nampo City, a white structure appeared on the seashore, which we knew was the Sohae Dam. It stands majestically at the mouth of the Taedong River where it meets the West Sea, an impressive sight. The car drove along the dam for 15 minutes before reaching the main body of the dam.

The entire dam consists of an 8-kilometer-long embankment, 36 floodgates, three ship locks, three fish passages, and two rotating bridges for ships. Besides the road and pedestrian walkway, there is also a railway on the dam. Here, Deputy Manager Ri Hyong-chol told us, "The construction of this dam cost 4 billion dollars, and it consumed over 400 million tons of cement. With these technologies and materials, one could build an entire city, but the benefits of the dam are incomparable."

It is understood that in the second year after the dam's completion, it faced a flood test. That year, the water volume of the Taedong River was 1.6 times greater than the disastrous year of 1967, but due to the smooth flood discharge of the dam and the prevention of seawater backflow, a major flood disaster was averted. Calculations show that the avoided losses from this single incident were more than double the investment in the dam.

Korea has many mountainous regions and limited arable land per capita, making the reclamation of tidal flats significant for agricultural development. After the completion of the Sohae Dam, the reservoir with 2.9 billion cubic meters of fresh water meets the irrigation needs of 100,000 acres of tidal flats in South Pyongan and South Hwanghae provinces.

The reservoir also provides living and industrial water for factories along the river, ensuring that water transportation is no longer affected by the rise and fall of seawater. Even during low tide, ships with several thousand tons of cargo can use the dam to enter the Taedong River, doubling the transport capacity compared to before the dam's construction. At the Sohae Dam, we witnessed a 20,000-ton cargo ship named "Zijinshan" from China passing through the dam into the inner river.

The Korean people are confident in further utilizing the Taedong River. A deputy director of the State Planning Commission's Land Planning Bureau excitedly told us, "According to the plan, 12 more dams will be built upstream of the Taedong River. Our goal is to effectively utilize every drop of water from the Taedong River!"

    不废江水滚滚流
    ——朝鲜大同江综合治理见闻
    本报记者　魏亚南　宁培芬
    直到1967年，汹涌的大同江水还淹没过首都平壤，连2层楼都泡了水。然而，不到十年工夫，不驯的大同江便被降伏为一条温顺之河，成为朝鲜民主主义共和国征服自然，造福社会的一个生动例证。
    大同江起源于朝鲜北部山区，流经首都平壤，注入朝鲜西海，是朝鲜5大江河之一。这条河的治理使朝鲜人民引为自豪，他们采取的主要办法是拦河建闸。截至目前，450公里长的大同江上已建起5座水闸，从上游向下，依次是顺川、成川、烽火、美林和西海水闸。5座水闸像5把神奇的巨锁，改变了大同江放荡不羁的性格，取得了综合的经济效益。
    出平壤沿大同江上行，走不多远便是水草丰美的美林原野，江上的第一座水闸就建在这里。下了车，只见一条水泥和钢铁结构的拦河大坝横陈江中，蔚为壮观。坝上设有一个船闸和十余扇闸门，顶部还有公路和人行道。
    管理水闸的吴权雄接待我们，他指着承压1.8万吨的闸门说：“水闸的第一个作用就是防洪。自建闸以来，没发生过一次水灾。”
    水闸建成后，在美林原野形成了一个巨大的人工湖，现已蓄水一亿立方米，满足了平壤市工业和生活用水。水库周围建了59个扬水站，成倍地扩大了平壤地区水浇地面积。宽阔的水面也使养鱼业发展起来。
    水闸提高了大同江的水位，不仅使沿江的风景变得更加秀丽，也增加了水上运输能力。以往只能在丰水期航行的千吨级货船，现在可以消除水浅碍航之虞，自由往来，而且由于5座水闸逐级提高了水位，航道也大大延长了。同时，水闸又是连接大同江两岸的桥梁，闸上公路使陆路运输变得通畅。
    参观完地上部分，我们进入了水下发电机房。那里有13台8000瓦发电机组，因为没到雨季，只有4台机组在发电。据说，美林水闸全年可发电1.2亿千瓦输往平壤。
    朝鲜朋友介绍，大同江上游相继建造的其余3座水闸与美林水闸的设计及作用大体相同，比较起来，最后建成的西海水闸更具特色。
    过南浦市向西，大海之滨一片白色的建筑物呈现在眼前，不用问就知道西海水闸到了。它屹立在西海岸大同江入海口处，极为壮观。汽车在坝上足足跑了15分钟，才到大水闸的主体部分。
    整个水闸是由长8公里的大坝、36个闸门、3个船闸、3孔鱼道和两座过船旋转桥组成，坝上除有公路和人行道外，还有铁路。这里的李雄哲副经理对我们说：“建造这座水闸耗资40亿美元，光水泥就用掉400多万吨。用这些技术和物资满可以建起一座城市，然而，水闸的建设效益却是无可比拟的。”
    据了解，水闸建成后的第2年就遇到了一次洪水的考验。那年，大同江水量比成灾的1967年还大1.6倍，但由于水闸泄洪畅通，并挡住了海水倒灌，防止了一场大洪灾。计算起来，仅这次避免的损失，就比建闸的投入多一倍以上。
    朝鲜多山地，人均耕地少，因而开垦海涂对发展农业有很大意义。西海水闸建成后，形成的蓄水29亿立方米的淡水库，满足了平安南道和黄海南道10万亩海涂的灌溉之需。
    水库也为沿江的城市工厂提供了生活和工业用水，使水上运输再也不受海水涨落影响，即使在落潮时，几万吨的海上货轮也能利用水闸驶入大同江，运力比建闸前提高了一倍。在西海水闸，我们亲眼看见一艘来自中国的“紫金山”号两万吨货轮，从海上通过水闸进入内江。
    朝鲜人民对大同江的进一步利用充满信心，国家建委国土规划局一位副局长兴奋地对我们说：“按规划，大同江的上游还要建12座水闸。我们的想法，就是要有效地利用大同江的每一滴水！”（附图片）
