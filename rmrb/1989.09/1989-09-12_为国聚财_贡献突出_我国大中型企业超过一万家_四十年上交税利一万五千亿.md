The primary source of China's fiscal revenue is industrial enterprises, with large and medium-sized enterprises being the main contributors. This was emphasized by a senior official from the national economic comprehensive department when discussing the status of large and medium-sized enterprises in China.

Recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics provides strong support for this point: From 1949 to 1989, large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in China cumulatively contributed nearly 150 billion yuan in taxes and profits to the national treasury, accounting for more than 49% of the national fiscal revenue during the same period. In 1988, large and medium-sized industrial enterprises achieved a profit and tax revenue of 14.4 billion yuan, of which 11.05 billion yuan was remitted to the state, accounting for 62.8% and 68.7% of the total profit and tax revenue realized and remitted by all independent accounting industrial enterprises, respectively.

China's large and medium-sized industrial enterprises began with the construction of 156 key projects during the First Five-Year Plan. After 40 years of development, by 1988, China had 10,676 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. These enterprises, spread across various industries such as energy, metallurgy, machinery, construction, chemicals, textiles, and light industry, are large in scale, have substantial assets, advanced production technology and equipment, and a high level of personnel quality, serving as a solid foundation for the nation's finances.

According to statistics, in 1988, there were 50 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises with a total profit and tax revenue exceeding 3.5 billion yuan. The profit and tax revenue remitted by these 50 enterprises alone accounted for nearly one-third of the total remitted by all more than 10,000 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, and 12% of the national fiscal revenue.

Only when enterprises have good economic benefits can they contribute more to the state. In terms of the number of enterprises, large and medium-sized industrial enterprises account for only 2% of independent accounting industrial enterprises; in terms of the number of employees, they account for only 34.7%. However, the profit and tax revenue they realize and remit account for 63% and 68%, respectively. Economic experts pointed out that if all industrial enterprises could achieve the same level of profit and tax revenue and remittance as large and medium-sized enterprises, China's fiscal revenue would see significant growth, and the national economy and social development would achieve even greater success.

The contributions of large and medium-sized enterprises to the state are commendable, but the challenges they face are also concerning. Issues such as lack of funds, scarcity of raw materials and energy, and limited autonomy are severely constraining the development of large and medium-sized enterprises. Economic experts call on all sectors of society to pay attention to large and medium-sized enterprises, take concrete measures to address their difficulties, and allow these enterprises to thrive, making even greater contributions to the national treasury.

### 为国聚财　贡献突出　我国大中型企业超过一万家　四十年上交税利一万五千亿

　　为国聚财　贡献突出
　　我国大中型企业超过一万家
　　四十年上交税利一万五千亿
    据新华社北京9月12日电　（记者徐耀中、张超文）我国的财政收入主要来自工业企业，而工业企业又主要依靠大中型企业。这是国家经济综合部门负责人介绍我国大中型企业状况时强调指出的。
    国家统计局新近提供的数据对此作了有力的佐证：从1949年到1989年，我国大中型工业企业累计上交国家财政的税收和利润近15000亿元，占国家同期财政收入的49％以上；1988年，大中型工业企业实现利税1440亿元，其中的1105亿元上交给国家，分别占全部独立核算工业企业实现和上交利税的62.8％和68.7％。
    我国的大中型工业企业是从第一个五年计划建设156项重点工程开始的。经过40年的建设，到1988年，我国已经拥有大中型工业企业10676个。这些遍布于能源、冶金、机械、建筑、化工、纺织、轻工等各行业的大中型企业规模大、资产雄厚、生产技术和设备较先进、人员素质较高，是国家财源的坚实后盾。
    据统计，1988年利税总额超过3.5亿元的大中型工业企业有50家。就是这50家企业上交的利税，是全部1万多个大中型工业企业上交总额的近1／3，占全国财政收入的12％。
    企业只有经济效益好，才能给国家上交得多。论企业数大中型工业企业只占独立核算工业企业的2％；论职工人数，只占34.7％。但它们实现的利税和上交的利税却分别占63％和68％。经济界人士指出，假若所有的工业企业都达到大中型企业的创利税水平、上交利税水平，我国的财政收入会有很大的增长，我国的国民经济和社会发展也会取得更大的成就。
    大中型企业对国家的贡献令人敬重，但它遇到的困扰又让人担忧。资金缺，原材料、能源少，自主权小，正严重束缚着大中型企业的发展。经济界人士呼吁社会各界都来关心大中型企业，采取具体措施为它们排忧解难，让大中型企业舒展身手，为国家财政做出更大贡献。
