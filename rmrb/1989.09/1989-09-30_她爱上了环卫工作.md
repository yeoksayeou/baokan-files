Wang Zhifu is an outstanding sanitation worker from our city's sanitation department. She works on the streets every day, starting her cleaning duties at 4:30 AM. Throughout the year, regardless of wind, rain, or snow, her hand never leaves the broom. Once, while running a high fever, she continued working while receiving an injection. Over the years, Wang has had very few days off, including weekends and holidays. She only took 3 days off for her honeymoon. During her pregnancy, she overcame morning sickness and did not take a single day off until the day she gave birth. From June 1982 to the present, she has worked an additional 9,000 hours.

In 1982, the organization appointed her as a supervisor, tasked with inspecting the cleaning quality of 18 teams. Even then, she continued to work alongside her colleagues, cleaning and transporting garbage. If an area was not cleaned thoroughly, she would clean it again. If a team was short-handed, she would step in to help. Soon after, she submitted a request to return to frontline cleaning duties, vowing to be a sanitation worker for life.

Due to her diligent work, Wang has been named a municipal first-class model worker for six consecutive years. She has also been named a provincial model worker and a national new Long March labor hero. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, she was invited to Beijing to participate in the national model worker and advanced worker commendation conference.

    她爱上了环卫工作
    王之馥是我市环卫处优秀清扫工。她每天工作在马路上，清早4点半开始清扫，一年四季，无论刮风、下雨下雪，手不离扫帚。一次发高烧，她一边打针，一边干活。几年来，小王很少休息节假日和星期天。婚假她只休息了3天，怀孕期间她克服妊娠反应，一天也没有休息，直到临产当天，她还在班上。从1982年6月至今，她多干了9000多小时。
    1982年，组织上让她当了业务员，其任务是检查18个班组的清扫质量。这时，她仍和过去一样，每天下班组和同伴们一块儿清扫、拉运垃圾。哪里扫得不干净，她就再扫一遍。哪个组人手少，她就去替补。不久，她向组织上递交了重返清扫一线的申请书，甘当一辈子清洁工。
    由于小王的勤奋劳动，她连续6年被评为市特等劳模，还被评为省劳模，全国新长征突击手。在建国40周年之际，她又进京参加全国劳模和先进工作者表彰大会。图为王之馥（左二）与黑龙江省劳模和先进工作者在一起。
