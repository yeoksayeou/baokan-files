	The Little Masters of the Film Festival
	By Luo Jinbiao

	On a midsummer night, the small town of Giffoni in the southern Apennines of Italy was as festive as a holiday. Powerful searchlights pierced the night sky, illuminating the ancient castle on the mountaintop; the windmills on the mid-hill were adorned with colorful lights; the stage set up on the temporary platform of the Masaniello Square was ablaze with lights, and nearly two thousand people gathered here, with enthusiastic applause and the shouts of "Bravo! Bravo!" from the seats under the "Jury" sign echoing through the air... The award ceremony of the 19th Giffoni International Children's Film Festival was being held here. The Giffoni International Children's Film Festival is one of the most important international children's film festivals in the world today, founded in 1971 by a group of high school "film enthusiasts" and held annually since then.

	The permanent institution of the film festival has about twenty people, and during the festival, there are about a hundred staff members, the vast majority of whom are children. Young children are the true masters here. The films screened at the festival are carefully selected, and the choice of themes and styles is made through the method of "going to the children." For example, this year's sixteen new competing films were selected from more than one hundred and sixty films submitted from various countries around the world, mostly based on the real lives of young children. Since its inception, the festival has had a jury composed entirely of junior high school students aged eleven to fourteen. They are the youngest jurors in the world's various film festivals, numbering nearly a hundred, and are also the largest jury in scale among the world's various film festivals.

	According to one of the founders of the film festival, the artistic director Guibitosi, the procedure for selecting the jury is as follows: The film festival sends invitations to various local governments in Italy every year, specifying the number of seats, and the local governments notify the schools accordingly. Students then sign up voluntarily; then the local government organizes an examination—after watching a children's film, the applicants are asked to comment on it, and then the best are selected based on the quality of their comments. Children are very interested in this activity and sign up enthusiastically. For example, this year's ninety jury members include eighteen from the Lombardy region and Genoa, who were selected from 140,000 applicants.

	The jurors meet directly with the film directors. They watch two films a day and then discuss them with the directors. The children criticize the films, ask questions, and the directors explain or answer. The discussion is lively and harmonious. By the day before the film festival ends, all the competing films have been screened, and the jurors vote on all the competing films, with the lowest score being six and the highest being ten. The films are then ranked based on their total scores to determine the first, second, and third prizes. The first prize winner of this film festival is the Canadian-Argentine co-production "The Colt," which scored 821 points.

	During the film festival, Italian Prime Minister Andreotti specially visited Giffoni, answered the children's questions, and listened to the children's comments on two competing films. The Prime Minister's evaluation is: "These young critics are more frank and direct than those famous critics."

    电影节的小主人
    本报记者　罗晋标
    仲夏夜，意大利南方亚平宁山区小镇吉福尼像节日一般，热闹非凡。探照灯的强大光柱划破夜空，照亮了山顶古堡；半山腰上的风车磨坊张灯结彩；马桑鲁米广场上临时搭起的舞台上灯火辉煌，近二千人聚集在这里，热烈的掌声与挂着“评委”大牌子下面的座席里发出的“布拉沃！”“布拉沃！”（意大利语“好！”）的欢呼声此起彼伏……第十九届吉福尼国际儿童电影节的发奖仪式正在这里举行。吉福尼国际儿童电影节是当今世界最重要的国际儿童电影节之一，于一九七一年由一批中学生“电影迷”创办，此后每年一届。
    电影节的常设机构约二十人，电影节期间工作人员约百人，绝大部分是孩子，少年儿童是这里的真正主人。电影节放映的影片经严格挑选，其题材和风格的选择是通过“到孩子们中去”的办法来进行的。例如今年参赛的十六部新影片，是从世界各国提供的一百六十多部影片中精选出来的，多以少年儿童的现实生活为题材。该电影节从创办至今，评委完全由初中生组成，年龄十一岁至十四岁。他们是世界各种电影节中最年轻的评委，人数多达近百人，又是世界各种电影节中规模最大的评委。
    据电影节创办人之一古比托西艺术指导介绍，评委产生的程序是：电影节每年向意大利各地方政府发出邀请，规定名额，地方政府据此通知各中学，先由学生自由报名；接着地方政府组织考试——让报名者看一部儿童影片后发表评论，然后据评论水平择优录取。孩子们对这一活动抱有浓厚兴趣，报名极为踊跃。例如，今年的九十名评委成员中，有十八名来自隆巴迪大区和热那亚市，他们是从十四万报名应试者中挑选出来的。
    评委们与影片导演直接见面。他们每天看两部影片，然后即与影片导演展开讨论。孩子们对影片品头论足，提出问题，导演则作出说明或回答。讨论会气氛热烈、融洽。到电影节结束前一天，参赛影片放映完毕，评委们对所有参赛影片最后投票打分，最低分六分，最高分十分，按各影片总计得分评出一等奖、二等奖和三等奖各一部。本届电影节一等奖获得者是加拿大和阿根廷合拍影片《马驹》，得八百二十一分。
    电影节期间，意大利总理安德烈奥蒂专程到吉福尼，回答了孩子们提出的问题，听取了孩子们对两部参赛影片的评议。总理的评价是：这些小评论家比那些知名评论家“更加坦率和直截了当”。
