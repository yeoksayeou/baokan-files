A passbook in hand, savings can be deposited and withdrawn throughout the city; each transaction takes no more than fifteen seconds. This is the achievement of the computer network savings system implemented by the Hefei Branch of the Bank of China yesterday.

According to the branch manager, Wu Fuxi, the feature of the computer network savings system is that it combines both wireless and wired network functions. In urban areas with good wired communication conditions and remote regions and rural areas lacking wired communication, as well as in situations where the communication lines are clear and when there are line faults, reliable operations can be ensured.

    中银合肥分行电脑联网储蓄
    新华社合肥九月九日电（记者姚燕戈）一折在手，全市通存通兑；每笔存兑所花时间不超过十五秒。这是中国银行合肥市分行昨天实现电脑联网储蓄实现的。
    据分行行长吴福五说，电脑联网储蓄的特点是：这个系统兼备无线电与有线联网两种功能，在有线通讯条件较好的市区和缺乏有线通讯条件的边远地区和农村，在通讯线路通畅和线路出现故障的情况下，都能可靠地进行工作。
