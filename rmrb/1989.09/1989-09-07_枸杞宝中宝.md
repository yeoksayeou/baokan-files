Ningxia's special products, including goji berries, licorice, Helan stones, desert sheep skin, and black moss, are known as the "five treasures" of red, yellow, blue, white, and black. Goji berries are at the top of this list. Ningxia goji berries have thin skins, thick flesh, and a sweet taste, making them the finest of their kind in the country. They are known for their benefits in brightening the eyes, moistening the lungs, nourishing the liver, tonifying the kidneys, boosting energy, generating essence, aiding yang, and fighting cancer.

In recent years, Ningxia's medical, scientific research, and food departments have developed and produced a series of goji products. These include:

	Goji Medicinal Wine
	Goji Medicinal Wine is based on the famous Tang Dynasty physician Shao Yingzhe's "Seven Treasure Beard Pill" formula. It is made with goji berries as the main ingredient, along with carefully selected Chinese yam, horny goat weed, and other herbs, all soaked in high-quality sorghum wine. Drinking this wine can invigorate yang, tonify the kidneys, clear the heart, and brighten the eyes, promoting longevity.

	Goji and Du Zhong Wine
	Goji and Du Zhong Wine is a new type of high-quality health wine. It is made with goji berries and du zhong as the main ingredients, along with codonopsis and astragalus, soaked in high-quality sorghum wine. The resulting wine has a brown-red color, an alcohol content of 30-36 degrees, a rich and mellow flavor, and a moderate concentration. It is mainly used to treat kidney deficiency, impotence, joint pain, and weakness in the waist and knees, making it a popular item both domestically and internationally.

	Goji Crystals
	Goji Crystals, Goji and Chrysanthemum Crystals, and Goji and Astragalus Crystals are concentrated effervescent tablets. They are brown-red in color, sweet in taste, and fully soluble in water, retaining all the nutrients of goji berries. These are popular high-grade health beverages.

	Goji Tea
	Goji Tea is made primarily from fresh leaves, with additional fruits, stems, and fruit stalks. Its nutritional content is the same as fresh goji berries. Brewing goji tea results in a clear, orange-yellow liquid that is sweet and fragrant. Drinking it invigorates the spirit, refreshes the mouth, and brightens the eyes. It has been exported to Hong Kong, Japan, and various Southeast Asian countries.
