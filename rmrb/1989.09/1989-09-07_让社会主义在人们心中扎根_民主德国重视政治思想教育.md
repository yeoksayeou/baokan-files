The German Democratic Republic has maintained steady economic development, political stability, and good social order over the past 40 years since its establishment. Socialism has a solid foothold in the country. After interviewing officials from the Central Propaganda Department of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the reporter felt that the GDR's ability to achieve this under such special circumstances is closely related to the party's consistent emphasis on political and ideological education and its active resistance to Western bourgeois influences.

Emphasizing the Party's Ideological Construction

The Socialist Unity Party of Germany adheres to Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology and educates all party members. The party has a tradition of implementing the "Party Training Year" system. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee makes decisions and proposes the tasks and plans for the "Party Training Year," including the study of Marxist-Leninist classics and party policies. This ensures that each party member continuously improves their theoretical and political ideological levels through study.

Additionally, all leading cadres must take turns attending party schools. Leading cadres from central departments and district-level leaders must attend the "Karl Marx" Advanced Party School and obtain a graduation certificate. Each district and county also has party schools.

In terms of study methods, the GDR party emphasizes the combination of theory and practice, encouraging the proposal of questions from the bottom up based on serious study, and conducting discussions to deepen understanding. As propaganda tools of the party, newspapers, radio stations, and other units actively cooperate with the party's central political and ideological education tasks, playing their respective roles.

Party organizations pay attention to the assessment and supervision of grassroots party organizations and members. For example, the "Summarization-Election" campaign for party grassroots organizations at the end of last year and the upcoming replacement of party membership cards in September are all linked to these tasks to educate party members, raise their ideological standards, and better play the role of party members. Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Schneider, told the reporter that the GDR party has a slogan: "Where there are party members, there is the party." Party members must play their roles and cannot simply put their party membership cards in their pockets and forget that they are communists. Party members not only need to actively participate in study, master Marxist-Leninist principles, understand party policies, and implement them in practical work, but they must also become "mobilizers," propagandize to the masses, and do ideological work among non-party members.

Continuity and Innovation

In building socialism, the GDR party emphasizes combining the continuity of policies with innovation. Comrade Schneider explained: "Continuity is adhering to socialist principles, and innovation is making changes on the basis of socialist principles." The party formulates its policies based on this spirit and, through ideological and political work, ensures that socialism is deeply rooted in people's hearts, turning party policies into the conscious actions of party members and the masses.

Comrade Geigel, the head of the Central Agitation Department, repeatedly emphasized in an interview with the reporter that the primary task of ideological work is to defend the values of socialism and prove its superiority. In response to the bourgeois criticism of socialism from the West, he pointed out that the GDR has rebuilt its country from the ruins of war and achieved tremendous success over the past 40 years, with the people's living standards continuously improving. This should be proudly propagated.

The GDR party believes that to better recognize the superiority of socialism, it is necessary to maintain a clear understanding of the essence of capitalism. Comrade Geigel said: "Marx, Engels, and Lenin correctly pointed out the essence of capitalism, which has not changed." Recently, Professor Kurt Tiedke, the president of the "Karl Marx" Advanced Party School, pointed out in a report at the academic conference commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR: "Today's capitalism is no less capitalist in nature than the capitalist system during the time of Marx and Engels." Therefore, exposing the ills of capitalist society and helping party members and the masses understand the essence of capitalism is also an important task of GDR propaganda work.

Actively Resisting Western Influences

The GDR party is keenly aware that the Western bourgeoisie always dreams of undermining socialism. For the GDR, the task of resisting Western bourgeois influences is particularly important. In most of the GDR's territory, three programs from the Federal Republic of Germany's television stations and one program from West Berlin's television station, as well as broadcasts from several radio stations, can be received. These programs are all broadcast in German, making their influence even more significant.

Regarding Western bourgeois propaganda, the GDR does not simply use blocking methods but guides the masses to correctly recognize the facts and logic. I have seen on several occasions in GDR television programs that after broadcasting a distorted report from a Western television station, a commentator analyzes and refutes it. Recently, in response to the distorted reports from Western television stations about the situation in China, the GDR station promptly broadcasted a video from China Central Television showing the truth about the suppression of the riots. These methods have achieved good results.

Comrades from the GDR believe that political and ideological education for young people is particularly important. Because they have not experienced the war and revolutionary years, they know little about history and lack social experience. Western propaganda is mainly targeted at GDR youth. Therefore, the party, through the Free German Youth League, does work among university students in higher education institutions, caring for their healthy growth. The Youth League encourages young students to study Marxist-Leninist theory vigorously and conduct patriotic and revolutionary tradition education in lively and lively forms, helping them recognize the superiority of socialism and consciously resist Western propaganda. Various newspapers often initiate discussions on issues of interest to young people and publish articles with educational significance. For example, recently, the "Weekly Mail" published an article in four full pages introducing the tragic fate of a GDR youth who moved to West Berlin, fell into various vices, and could not extricate himself, eventually dying on the street. This has caused a strong reaction among young people.

The GDR's political and ideological education work is effective. While carrying out these tasks, GDR comrades have repeatedly emphasized that the most powerful argument is the reality of socialism. In the face of facts, Western propaganda falls apart on its own. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to prove the superiority of socialism with the actual achievements of socialist construction and the further improvement of people's living standards. This is the most convincing "ideological work."

### 让社会主义在人们心中扎根——民主德国重视政治思想教育

    让社会主义在人们心中扎根
    ——民主德国重视政治思想教育
    本报记者　许宏治
    德意志民主共和国成立40年来，经济上持续稳定发展，政治上长期保持安定，社会秩序良好，社会主义拥有巩固的阵地。
    记者对民德党中央宣传部门负责同志进行采访后感到，民主德国处在那种特殊环境下能做到这一点，是和民德党一贯重视政治思想教育、积极抵制西方资产阶级影响分不开的。
      重视党的思想建设
    德国统一社会党坚持以马克思列宁主义作为党的指导思想，并教育全体党员。党内有实行“党训年”制度的传统。由党中央政治局作出决定，提出“党训年”的学习任务和计划，学习内容包括马列主义经典著作和党的方针政策，使每个党员通过学习不断提高马克思列宁主义理论水平和政治思想水平。
      另外，所有领导干部都要轮流进党校学习。中央部门领导干部和专区领导干部必须进“卡尔·马克思”高级党校，取得毕业证书。各专区、县也都设有党校。
    在学习方法上，民德党强调理论与实际相结合，提倡在认真研读的基础上，自下而上地提出问题，开展讨论，加深认识。作为党的宣传工具的报刊、电台等单位，积极配合党的政治思想教育的中心任务，发挥自己的作用。
      党组织注意对基层党组织和党员的考核和监督。如去年年底进行的党的基层组织的“总结——选举”运动和今年9月即将开始的更换党证，都是结合这些工作对党员进行教育，使党员在思想上得到提高，更好地发挥党员作用。党中央宣传部副部长施奈德告诉记者，民德党有一个口号：“有党员的地方就有党”。党员要发挥作用，不能把党证往兜里一揣，就忘记了自己是一个共产党员。党员不但要积极参加学习，掌握马列主义原理，领会党的方针政策，并在实际工作中加以贯彻，而且要成为“鼓动员”，对群众进行宣传，做好党外群众的思想工作。
                      连续性和革新性
    民德党在建设社会主义的事业中，强调把政策的持续性和革新性结合起来。施奈德同志解释说：“持续性就是坚持社会主义原则，革新性就是在社会主义原则基础上进行变革”。党根据这一精神制定自己的政策，并通过思想政治工作使社会主义深入人心，把党的政策变为党员和人民群众的自觉行动。
    党中央鼓动部部长盖格尔在接受记者采访时反复强调，思想工作的首要任务是捍卫社会主义的价值，证明社会主义的优越性。针对西方资产阶级诋毁社会主义的论调，他指出，民主德国在战争的废墟上重建自己的国家，40年来取得了巨大成就，人民生活水平不断提高，对此要理直气壮地进行宣传。
    民德党认为，为了更好地认识社会主义优越性，必须对资本主义的本质保持清醒的认识。盖格尔说：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁正确地指出了资本主义的本质，这一本质现在并未改变。”不久前，“卡尔·马克思”高级党校校长库尔特·蒂德克教授在纪念民主德国成立40周年学术会议上所作的报告中也指出：“今天的资本主义并不比马克思、恩格斯在世时的资本主义制度在资本主义性质上有任何减轻”。因此，揭露资本主义社会的弊病，帮助党员和人民群众认清资本主义的本质，也是民德宣传工作的一项重要任务。
                  积极抵制西方影响
    民德党清醒地看到，西方资产阶级总是梦想瓦解社会主义。对于民主德国来说，抵制西方资产阶级影响的任务尤其显得重要。在民德绝大部分国土上可以收看收听到联邦德国电视台的三套节目，西柏林电视台的一套节目，以及多家电台的广播。这些节目全都用德语播出，因而其影响更加不可忽视。
    对于西方资产阶级的宣传，民德不是简单地采用封锁的办法，而是用摆事实、讲道理的办法引导群众正确认识。我曾多次在民德电视节目中看到，电视台在播放一段西方电视台的歪曲报道后，由评论员进行分析、批驳。不久前，针对西方电视台关于中国局势的歪曲报道，民德台及时播放了中国中央电视台的平暴真相录像。这些做法收到了很好的效果。
    民德同志认为，对青年进行政治思想教育尤其重要。因为他们没有经历过战争和革命年代，对历史了解不多，而且缺乏社会经验。西方的宣传主要以民德青年为对象。因此，党通过自由德国青年联盟在高等学校中做大学生的工作，关心他们的健康成长。青盟鼓励青年学生努力学习马列主义理论，以生动活泼的形式对青年进行爱国主义和革命传统教育，帮助他们认识社会主义的优越性，自觉抵制西方宣传。各种报刊也经常就青年感兴趣的问题发起讨论，刊登有教育意义的文章。例如，最近《每周邮报》以四个整版的篇幅载文介绍了一位民德青年移居西柏林后走投无路，染上种种恶习而不能自拔，最后死在街头的悲惨遭遇，在青年中引起强烈反响。
    民德的政治思想教育工作是富有成效的。在进行这些工作的同时，民德同志也一再强调，最有力的论据还是社会主义的现实。在事实面前，西方的宣传不攻自破。因此，必须努力以社会主义建设的实际成就，人民生活水平的进一步提高，来证明社会主义的优越性，增加社会主义的吸引力。这也是最有说服力的“思想工作”。
