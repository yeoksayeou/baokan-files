The United Nations Security Council issued a statement today, strongly condemning the assassination of a senior official of the South West Africa People's Organization, Anton Robbieski.

The statement said that the recent savage act of assassinating Robbieski in Windhoek, which occurred during the preparations for Namibia's elections, should be particularly condemned. According to the Security Council's Resolution 435, free and fair elections are a key element of Namibia's independence plan.

The Security Council emphasized the necessity of preventing the recurrence of such terrorist acts and the importance of adhering to the letter and spirit of the election regulations agreed upon by the relevant parties. The Security Council also demanded that the relevant parties take all appropriate measures immediately to ensure the safety of all Namibians, especially the leaders of all political parties. The Security Council finally expressed its full support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in this regard.

    本报联合国9月15日电记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天发表声明，强烈谴责刺杀西南非洲人民组织高级官员安托·罗博斯基的暴行。
    声明说，最近在温得和克刺杀罗博斯基的野蛮行为，正发生在准备纳米比亚大选的过程中，应特别受到严责，因为根据安理会的435号决议，自由和公正的选举是纳米比亚独立计划的要素。
    安理会全体理事国特别强调阻止再发生这种恐怖主义行动的必要性，以及遵守有关各方已同意的选举法规文字和精神的重要性。安理会还要求有关各方立即采取一切适当措施，以确保全体纳米比亚人、特别是全部政党领袖的人身安全。安理会最后表示完全支持联合国秘书长正在这方面进行的努力。
