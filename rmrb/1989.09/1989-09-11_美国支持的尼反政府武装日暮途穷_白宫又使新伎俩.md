The White House has decided to use U.S. dollars to create a "Trojan Horse" within Nicaragua. According to the September 9th disclosure by the U.S. Washington Post, the U.S. government plans to provide $3 million in election funds to the Nicaraguan opposition, aiming to peacefully defeat the Sandinista government in the 1990 February elections. Through "democracy" and "freedom," they seek to obtain what the anti-government forces have already failed to achieve on the battlefield.

According to reports, the U.S. originally planned to secretly influence the Nicaraguan election process through the Central Intelligence Agency. On September 2nd, the Nicaraguan National Opposition Union, composed of 14 opposition parties, after five rounds of negotiations and mutual deals, finally pushed forward Doña Violeta Chamorro as the presidential candidate amid a cacophony of voices. Western news agencies reported that the White House was overjoyed because Doña Chamorro is considered a personal friend of U.S. President Bush. In March of this year, Doña Chamorro had visited the White House to meet with Bush. Furthermore, Doña Chamorro's husband was a famous Nicaraguan democratic fighter who was assassinated by the Somoza dictatorship in 1978. She herself is an opponent of the Sandinista government and is currently the editor-in-chief of the opposition newspaper La Prensa; her son Pedro Joaquín is one of the leaders of the anti-government forces (Contras). Therefore, the U.S. believes that Doña Chamorro's candidacy provides an "important opportunity" to defeat the Sandinista government. Hence, the decision was made to provide $3 million in election funds through the U.S. "National Endowment for Democracy." The "Democracy Foundation" was established in 1982, specifically to fund "democratic movements" around the world. In fact, the U.S. Congress has already approved $3.5 million for the foundation to support the "democratic movement" in Nicaragua from October 1988 to October 1989, including funding for Doña Chamorro's La Prensa and various "democratic groups" within Nicaragua.

The 1979 Nicaraguan Sandinista Revolution disrupted the U.S.'s "Central American democratic chain," and thus, the U.S. has always viewed the Sandinista government as a thorn in its side, determined to uproot it. Despite Nicaragua's repeated declarations of willingness to coexist peacefully with the U.S., the U.S. still considers the Sandinista government a threat to its strategic rear security interests because conducting a people's revolution in Central America does not align with the U.S.'s "values." Moreover, with the Salvadoran guerrillas growing stronger, the U.S. is even more concerned about the "domino effect" in its backyard. Over the years, the U.S. has provided billions of dollars in military and "humanitarian" aid to the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, imposed an embargo on Nicaragua, and has been relentlessly trying to overthrow the Sandinista government. However, the anti-government forces, once seen as the U.S.'s "ace," have not been able to achieve victory on the battlefield and are now on the verge of collapse, to the point where the presidents of the five Central American countries decided to disband this illegal force, which is paid by the U.S. and stationed in Honduras.

Now, the White House has decided to deploy dollars and use the strategy of "democracy" and "freedom." This is merely a shift from military failure to "peaceful evolution," attempting to smuggle a "Trojan Horse" into Nicaragua with dollars. This method of internal "peaceful" subversion is more "legal" and less noticeable, unlike the gunfire on the battlefield that easily attracts attention. The Washington Post said this method will not face opposition from the U.S. Congress, but it is indeed worth noting.

### 美国支持的尼反政府武装日暮途穷　白宫又使新伎俩

　　美国支持的尼反政府武装日暮途穷
　　白宫又使新伎俩
　　本报记者　郭伟成
    白宫决定用美钞在尼加拉瓜内部“制造”一具“特洛伊木马”。据美国《华盛顿邮报》9日披露，美国政府计划向尼加拉瓜反对派提供300万美元的竞选经费，用以在1990年2月大选中和平地击败桑地诺政权，通过“民主”与“自由”的手段，争取得到尼加拉瓜反政府武装已经注定在战场上得不到的东西。
    据报道，美国原计划通过中央情报局的秘密插手，对尼加拉瓜大选进程施加影响。9月2日，由14个反对党组成的尼加拉瓜全国反对党联盟在经过5轮讨价还价，彼此交易之后，终于在一片吵闹声中推出了维奥莱塔·德查莫罗夫人作为总统候选人。西方通讯社报道说，白宫对此感到喜出望外，因为德查莫罗夫人被认为是美国总统布什的私人朋友。今年3月，德查莫罗夫人还曾去白宫拜会布什。再者，德查莫罗夫人的丈夫是尼加拉瓜著名的民主战士，1978年被索摩查独裁政权暗杀。她本人是桑地诺政权的反对派，目前是尼加拉瓜反对派喉舌《新闻报》的社长；其子彼德罗·华金是反政府武装（康特拉）的领导人之一，因此，美国认为，德查莫罗夫人作为候选人出现为击败桑地诺政权提供了“重要机会”。从而决定通过美国“全国民主基金会”向其提供300万美元竞选经费。美国“民主基金会”设立于1982年，专门用于资助世界各国的“民主运动”。事实上，美国国会已经批准该基金会在1988年10月到1989年10月的财政年度里向尼加拉瓜“民主运动”提供350万美元，包括资助德查莫罗夫人领导的《新闻报》及尼加拉瓜国内的一些“民主团体”。
    1979年的尼加拉瓜桑地诺革命，打断了美国的“中美洲民主锁链”，因此，美国一直视桑地诺政权为眼中钉，肉中刺，必欲拔之而后快。尽管尼加拉瓜一再声明愿与美国友好相处；但是美国仍然认为桑地诺政权是对美国战略后方安全利益的威胁，因为在中美洲进行人民革命是不符合美国的“价值观念”的。加之萨尔瓦多游击队越战越强，因此，美国更加担心在后院产生“多米诺效应”。多年来，美国向尼加拉瓜反政府武装提供了数以亿计美元的军事与“人道主义”援助，对尼加拉瓜实行“禁运”等等，处心积虑地要整垮桑地诺政权。但是，一度被美国视为“王牌”的反政府武装未能在战场上取胜，反而日暮途穷，以至于中美洲5国总统决定对这支领美国军饷，盘踞在洪都拉斯境内的非法武装予以遣散。
    现在，白宫决定投放美元，运用“民主”与“自由”的策略了。这只不过是在武装演变失败以后，改用“和平演变”的策略，企图用美元堆一尊“特洛伊木马”运进尼加拉瓜去。这种从内部“和平”地进行颠覆的手段，比较“合法”，而且不易被人察觉，不像战场上的枪炮声那样引人反感。《华盛顿邮报》说，这种方法也不会遭到美国国会的反对，不过，倒是非常值得引起人们的注意。
