The throwing group's pair of "sisters"
Almost the same height, almost the same weight, both from Zhejiang, both practicing throwing events, and both winning gold medals for the first time at the World University Games. Huang Zhi Hong and Hou Xue Mei are truly a pair of "sisters" in the national track and field team's throwing group.

On the day of the shot put final, the elder sister Hou Xue Mei was even more nervous than Huang Zhi Hong, repeatedly reminding her from outside the field: "Little Huang, it's up to you now!"

The discus final began, and Hou Xue Mei faced challenges from several strong opponents. Huang Zhi Hong stood on the stands, using her strong chest and abdominal resonance to shout: "Hou Xue Mei... come on!" The stadium echoed with her voice. Hou Xue Mei won the gold medal, and Huang Zhi Hong's voice was hoarse from cheering.

The Most Enthusiastic Spectators
The people of Duisburg love track and field, and the World University Games track and field events attract tens of thousands of spectators every day. Whether it's an elderly person with a cane or a innocent child, they always cheer with the most enthusiastic applause for every brilliant performance by the athletes. Many athletes from the Chinese track and field team sighed: In China, there are too few people who love and care about track and field. Ball games have spectators packed like mountains and rivers, while track and field events have sparse audiences on the stands, making the athletes feel very uncomfortable. The enthusiasm of the spectators can sometimes inspire athletes to perform beyond their usual level. Chinese athletes who felt this deeply praised: The people of Duisburg are truly the most enthusiastic spectators in the world.

    世界大学生运动会花絮
    投掷组的一对“姊妹花”
    差不多的身高，差不多的体重，同是浙江人，同练投掷项目，又同在世界大学生运动会上首次夺得金牌。黄志红和侯雪梅可真是国家田径队投掷组的一对“姊妹花”。
    铅球决赛那天，大姐侯雪梅比黄志红还紧张，在场外一遍又一遍地叮咛：“小黄，就看你的了！”
    铁饼决赛开始了，侯雪梅受到好几个强手的挑战。黄志红站在看台上，发挥自己胸、腹腔共鸣强的特长，气沉丹田：“侯雪梅……加油！”体育场只听见她的声音在回荡。侯雪梅的金牌拿到了，黄志红的嗓子也喊哑了。
    最热情的观众
    杜伊斯堡人热爱田径，世界大学生运动会田径场每天都有数万名观战者。无论是拄着拐杖的白发老人，还是天真可爱的少年儿童，总是以最热烈的掌声为运动员每一次精彩表演喝采加油。中国田径队的许多运动员感叹道：在中国，喜欢和关心田径的人太少，球类比赛观众人山人海，而田径比赛，看台上观众寥寥无几，运动员心里很不是滋味。观众的热情有时能激发运动员发挥超水平。深有所感的中国运动员纷纷赞道：杜伊斯堡人真是堪称世界上最热情的观众。
