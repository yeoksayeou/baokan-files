The shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling, and women's judo events of the second National Youth Games have concluded, while the track and field, swimming, and table tennis competitions are in full swing. So far, the host Liaoning delegation holds a significant advantage.

In the shooting competition, Jiangsu's Zhang Hongyuan set a new Asian record in the 50-meter moving target (standard speed) final with a score of 593 rings, surpassing Liaoning's Li Yuwai's previous record of 589 rings. This score is also better than the 592 rings (excluding the additional 10 shots) achieved by the gold medalist of the 24th Olympic Games. The last five gold medals in the shooting competition were won by athletes from Hunan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. Overall, the 50-meter moving target event showed a high level of competition, with several top contenders demonstrating great potential. While other events also saw the emergence of promising talents, the fundamentals were not yet solid, and performances were inconsistent.

In women's judo, Liaoning's athletes showcased superior skills, winning 4 out of 8 gold medals, demonstrating their strong capabilities. The Greco-Roman wrestling competition has also concluded, with Liaoning securing 2 out of 10 gold medals, while the remaining medals were won by wrestlers from Jilin, Gansu, Tianjin, and other regions.

In track and field, gold medals were distributed widely, with Henan, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Tianjin, Hebei, Guangdong, Jilin, Shanxi, Hunan, and Shaanxi all securing gold medals in field and track events.

　　章宏远超一项射击亚洲纪录
    青运会辽宁代表团整体实力突出
    本报沈阳9月11日电　记者黄振中、汪大昭报道：第二届全国青运会的射击、古典式摔跤、女子柔道等赛事已毕，田径、游泳、乒乓球等项鏖战正酣。到目前为止，东道主辽宁代表团占较大优势。
    射击赛，在50米移动靶（标准速）的决赛中，江苏小伙章宏远以593环的成绩，超过了辽宁选手李玉伟保持的589环的亚洲纪录。这个成绩也比第24届奥运会冠军获得者592环（不包括加射10发）的成绩好。射击比赛的最后五块金牌分别被湖南、贵州、陕西、辽宁、黑龙江选手夺走。从整个射击赛看，50米移动靶项目水平较高，前几名选手很有潜力。其它几项虽然也出现一批有希望的苗子，但基本功还不过硬，起伏大。
    女子柔道，辽宁选手技艺超群，在8个级别角逐中独占4枚金牌，显示出雄厚实力。古典式摔跤也已结束，10枚金牌中，辽宁占两块，其它由吉林、甘肃、天津等地跤手夺得。
    田径的金牌出现四面开花局面，河南、内蒙古、山东、天津、河北、广东、吉林、山西、湖南、陕西都得到田赛和径赛金牌。
