Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Huang Caihong and Li Chenghua report:

Since China's reform and opening up, the People's Navy, stationed along the vast coastline, has leveraged its strengths to actively support key construction projects in its garrison areas, promoting military-civilian unity.

When the State Council announced the opening of 14 cities to the outside world, the Navy Party Committee immediately issued a notice to coastal units, requiring them to vigorously support the opening up and economic construction of coastal cities. In just five years, the Navy's coastal units dispatched over 300,000 personnel, 4,300 ships, and aircraft to participate in more than 1,400 local construction projects. These units have handed over more than 20 piers, 12 airports, and some railway dedicated lines for shared use with local authorities.

In the construction of coastal economic development zones, the officers and soldiers of the People's Navy have made significant contributions. The underwater drilling, blasting, and dredging of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, the related projects of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, and the expansion projects of the open ports in Qingdao, Yantai, and Haikou, were all undertaken and successfully completed by the Navy's personnel.

During the development of Hainan, Navy personnel have toiled in nearly 100 major projects, including ports, power plants, highways, communication facilities, and tourist sites. The Xiamen Maritime Police District, which the Navy has designated as an "Advanced Unit for Supporting the Government and Loving the People," dispatched personnel, vessels, and vehicles to help factories overcome difficulties when they faced shortages of fuel and raw materials, preventing shutdowns.

In recent years, the Navy's coastal units have established over 800 "Civilized Islands" and "Civilized Fishery Villages" along the coastline. They have utilized their equipment and technical advantages to train over 55,000 technical personnel for these islands and villages, and repaired over 160,000 mechanical equipment units. The certain submarine chaser squadron stationed at the farthest edge of the Yellow Sea and the island's people have worked together to "build a sea fortress and create a happy life together." Since 1986, they have jointly formulated a three-year plan for island development, setting four major goals: increasing annual economic income by 17% each year; jointly managing the power supply network; jointly building a ring road around the island; and improving education, raising the enrollment and promotion rates from 60% to 90%. Through the joint efforts of both military and civilian sides over three years, all these goals were achieved by last year. This year, both sides have worked together to improve the island's environment by building a dam, reclaiming land, and constructing a seaside park.

    海军支援驻地建设成绩斐然
    军民谱写鱼水新篇　共建数百文明单位
    本报讯　新华社记者黄彩虹、本报记者李成华报道：我国改革开放以来，驻守在万里海疆的人民海军部队，发挥优势，积极支援驻地重点工程建设，推进军政军民团结。
    当国务院宣布14个城市对外开放的时候，海军党委立即给沿海部队发出通知，要求他们大力支援沿海城市的对外开放和经济建设，短短5年，海军驻沿海部队就派出官兵300多万人次、舰船和飞机4300余艘（架）次，参加地方工程建设1400余项。这些部队先后拿出20多座码头、12个机场和部分铁路专用线与地方合用。
    在沿海经济特区的建设中，人民海军官兵们做出了贡献。被称为“急、难、险、重”的秦山核电站水下钻孔、爆破清渣和大亚湾核电站有关工程，以及青岛、烟台、海口等对外开放机场的扩建工程，都由海军指战员带头承担，出色地完成。
    在开发海南的日子里，海军指战员在港口、电厂、高速公路、通讯设施和旅游网点等近百项大型工程建设中流下了辛勤的汗水。被海军树为“拥政爱民先进标兵”的厦门水警区，在厦门火力发电厂、卷烟厂等单位缺少燃料、原料而濒临停产时，出动人员、舰艇和车辆，帮助工厂渡过难关。
    近年来，海军驻沿海部队在万里海疆建起800多个“文明岛”和“文明渔村”。他们发挥自己装备和技术的优势，为海岛渔村培训各类技术人才55000余名，维修各种机械设备16万台件。驻守在黄海最边远的海岛某猎潜艇大队与岛上人民“同筑海上堡垒，共建生活乐园”。他们从1986年开始，共同制定建岛富岛的3年规划，提出了4大奋斗目标：每年的经济收益指标递增17％；军民合力办好发电用电网；同修环岛公路；共抓海岛教育事业，使入学和升学率由过去的60％上升到90％。经过军民双方的3年努力，到去年全部实现这些目标。今年，军地双方为改善海岛环境，又拦坝填海，建造一座海岛公园。
