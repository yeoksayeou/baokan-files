The testing equipment for selecting car drivers, jointly developed by Jiang Huálín and Wáng Mènglái of the Logistics Department of the Shenyang Military Region and the Transportation Engineering Research Institute of Jilin Industrial University, recently won a second-class military science and technology progress award.

This testing equipment includes three components: a driver reaction testing device, an attention testing device, and a speed judgment testing device. It can strictly control the psychological and physiological qualities required for selecting drivers, eliminating those who do not possess the necessary driving adaptability.

　　选拔汽车驾驶员可以借助测试仪
    本报讯　沈阳军区后勤部姜华林、王梦来与吉林工业大学运输工程研究所合作研制的汽车驾驶适性检测仪，前不久获军队科技进步二等奖。
    这种检测仪包括驾驶员反应测试仪、注意力测试仪和速度判断测试仪三项。用它可以严格把住驾驶员选拔的心理、生理素质关，淘汰不具备驾驶适应性的人员。（吕永岩）
