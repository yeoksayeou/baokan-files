The party committee members of a certain group army under the Nanjing Military Region are strict with themselves and work hard. They do not buy luxury cars, do not build grand buildings, and do not seek special benefits. They are praised by the troops as a "clean party committee."

	No Luxury Cars
Since 1985, the trend of purchasing imported luxury cars and upgrading vehicles has been prevalent, and many local party and government agencies, factories, and enterprises have been "trading up." However, this group army has not bought a single imported car and still uses the Beijing Jeeps and Shanghai cars issued by higher authorities.

Some comrades say that the leaders at the group army level are still driving Jeeps, which is too shabby and embarrassing, and does not keep up with the "trends." However, the commander of the group army, Guo Xizhang, says, "Although conditions have improved, we cannot change our spirit of hard work and self-reliance." The political commissar, Wen Zongren, says, "As long as there is a car to sit in, that's enough. Why bother with the difference? We should not compete in car usage and enjoyment but in work performance."

The group army party committee does not buy luxury cars, and in car usage, they also distinguish between public and private matters, strictly follow regulations, do not seek special treatment, and do not pursue extra benefits. Military leaders have never had a fixed car. They take whatever car is assigned to them. When going out for meetings or visiting units, if one car can be shared, they do not assign two. It is common for the commander and political commissar to share one car.

	No Grand Hotels
The group army headquarters is located in a bustling city area, surrounded by tall buildings such as the "White Cloud Mansion" with more than ten floors, the railway apartment, and many luxurious hotels and guesthouses. However, since 1981, this group army has not built any new buildings. The group army headquarters office building is still from the early 1950s, and the military leaders' office building was built during the Japanese puppet regime, over 50 years old. The office space is very tight, and at one time, several units shared the same office. Some departments had only one room. This group army has two guesthouses, neither of which is decent. When some division and regiment leaders come to the army for meetings, they often have to share a room with three or four people. Five years ago, the relevant departments of the headquarters suggested building a high-level guesthouse, and even the blueprints were designed, but the party committee vetoed it.

This group army not only does not build new buildings but also does not follow the trend of "decoration" in recent years. The commander, political commissar, and other military leaders' offices do not have air conditioning, carpets, or any luxurious decorations. The military leaders have been in their positions since 1983, and in the more than five years since then, they have not added any office supplies. Inside the office: one desk has been used for over a decade and is quite old; one wicker chair, two sofas that have been used for over a decade, and a bookcase. It is so simple that it is hard for ordinary people to believe that this is a military leader's office. Is it that the headquarters does not provide new and better items? The relevant departments of the headquarters have also proposed adding some decent desks and chairs to the military leaders' offices, but they were all rejected.

This group army does not build new buildings or office facilities. Is it because they do not have the money? No, the group army has an annual production and business income of over 20 million yuan. But they do not think about cars and houses, and they do not spend money on these things. Instead, they use the money for the grassroots level and for the modernization of the army. In the past few years, 14 regiments have built new-style barracks, allowing soldiers to move out of old, dilapidated, and dangerous buildings into new ones.

	No Special Benefits
The party committee of this group army believes that to govern cleanly, one must start from small things and from the leaders. In 1985, the party committee made a decision on strengthening the party committee's own construction. In 1987, they made regulations on strengthening party supervision. At the beginning of this year, they made regulations on the party committee's integrity and clean governance.

In terms of living allowances, they do not create a hierarchy and insist that generals and lieutenants are treated the same. Every year, the unit's issued allowances are the same for military leaders and platoon-level officers. They say that in this aspect, it is better not to have strict levels but to be the same. During festivals and holidays, the supply of materials to the headquarters is the same for military leaders and headquarters staff. Headquarters staff say that in not pursuing special treatment, our party committee members are steadfast. Public service personnel are strictly assigned according to regulations. Over the years, they have always insisted on assigning public service personnel according to regulations, with deputy military-level positions sharing one public service employee. Group army leaders going out or visiting the grassroots level have never brought a public service employee; they wash their own clothes.

No one has taken old-age leave. The group army leaders are all over 45 years old, and no one has taken the annual regulated old-age leave. The health department's arranged recuperation has all been in vain, and no one has used a recuperation certificate.

The party committee members' living treatment is not special and is the same as the headquarters. However, in work, they insist on high standards. They devote all their energy to the construction of the army. In recent years, the group army party committee members have each spent over three months a year visiting units. Last year, the six committee members each spent an average of 115 days visiting units. This year, from January to September, they each spent an average of 85 days visiting units. They often stay in a company for a month or half a month, focusing on implementation and helping the grassroots level.

    高级轿车不买，豪华宾馆不盖，福利待遇不搞特殊——
　  请看这个军党委
　　揭衍珍　齐毓春
    南京军区某集团军党委成员严于律己，艰苦奋斗，他们高级轿车不买，楼堂馆所不盖，生活不特殊，被官兵誉为“廉洁党委”。
            高级轿车不买
    1985年以来，争购进口豪华轿车、换好车之风久盛不衰，一些地方党政机关，厂矿企业纷纷“鸟枪换炮”。然而，这个集团军没有买过一台进口轿车，至今没有豪华轿车，用的仍是上级配发的北京吉普、上海轿车。
    有的同志说，集团军一级领导，现在仍然坐吉普车，太寒酸了，面子难看，跟不上“形势”，而这个集团军军长郭锡章说：“现在条件好了，但艰苦奋斗不能变。”政委温宗仁说：“只要有个车坐就行了，计较好差干什么，我们不能在用车享受上争，应在工作上争高低。”
    集团军党委不买豪华车，在用车上他们也公私分明，严格按规定办，不搞特殊，不贪额外享受。军领导从来没有固定过专车，派什么车坐什么车，外出开会、下部队能合用一台车、决不派两台，军长、政委合坐一台车是常事。
          豪华宾馆不盖
    这个集团军机关驻在城市繁华地段，周围一幢幢高楼拔地而起，有十多层高的“白云大厦”、铁路公寓，还有不少设施豪华的宾馆，招待所。而这个集团军自1981年以来，没有盖过楼堂馆所。集团军机关办公楼也还是50年代初建造的，军领导办公楼是日伪时期盖的，已有50多年的历史了。机关办公楼很紧张，有段时间，几个单位合在一起办公，有的一个处只有一间房子。这个集团军有两个招待所，没有一个像样的，一些师、团领导来军开会，经常是三四个人挤一间，机关有关部门5年前就向党委建议盖一幢高级的招待楼，甚至连图纸都设计好了，结果还是给党委否决了。
    这个集团军不仅楼堂馆所不盖，就连这几年时兴的“装璜风”也不跟。军长、政委和其他军领导办公室没有空调，没有地毯，没有一件豪华摆设。军领导大都是1983年任军职的，自任职5年多来办公室没有添过一件办公用品。办公室内：一张办公桌已用了十几年，很陈旧；一张藤椅，两张用了十几年的旧沙发，一个书柜，这么简单，一般人很难相信这是军领导办公室。是机关不给添新的、好的吗？机关有关部门也曾提出给军领导办公室添点像样的桌椅，但都被他们拒绝了。
    这个集团军不盖楼堂馆所，不置办公设施，是他们没有钱吗？不是，集团军每年生产经营收入2000多万元。但他们心思不往车子、房子上想，钱也不往这上面花，而是用到了基层，用在了部队现代化建设上。这几年就有14个团盖了新式营房，使士兵从旧房、破房、危房中搬入了新房。
          福利待遇不搞特殊
    这个集团军党委认为，为政清廉就要从点滴做起，从领导做起。1985年党委作出了关于加强党委自身建设的决定，1987年作出了关于加强党内监督的规定，今年初又作出了关于党委清正廉洁的规定。
    生活补助上他们不搞三六九等，坚持将军和尉官一个样。每年单位发的补助，军领导不多拿一分，和排职干部一样。他们说，在这方面不能等级森严了，还是一个样好。逢年过节机关物资供应，军领导和机关干部一样。机关干部说，在不搞特殊化方面，我们党委成员是过得硬的。公勤人员严格按规定配备。几年来，他们一直坚持按规定配公勤人员，副军职一直是两人合用一个公务员。集团军领导外出、下基层，从未带过公务员，衣服自己洗。
    老年假没一个人休过。集团军领导都在45岁以上，每年规定的老年假没一人休。卫生部门安排的疗养都落空，疗养证没一人用过。
    党委成员生活待遇不搞特殊，和机关一个样子，工作上他们却坚持高标准。一门心思扑在部队建设上。几年来集团军党委常委每人每年下部队3个月以上，去年6名常委人均下部队115天，今年1至9月人均下部队85天，经常在连队一住就是一月半月的，抓落实，帮基层。
