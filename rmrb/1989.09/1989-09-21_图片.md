The traditional Peking opera "The Gift of the Silk Robe" is based on a historical story from the Warring States period between Fan Sui and Xu Jia. In the 1930s, it was created and performed by the famous Peking opera artists Gao Qingkui and Hao Shoucheng. In the 1950s, it was adapted by Li Hezeng and Yuan Shihai, becoming a highly acclaimed opera of that time. Recently, the Beijing Military Region's Friendship Peking Opera Troupe has made further revisions, and it was performed at the national military arts festival. The opera has made new innovations in the exploration of characters' inner thoughts, the renewal of musical arias, and stage design.

    传统京剧《赠绨袍》取材于战国时代的范睢和须贾之间的一段历史故事，30年代曾由京剧名家高庆奎、郝寿臣两位先生创作并演出，50年代又经李和曾、袁世海改编，成为当时颇得好评的一出戏。最近，北京军区战友京剧团又再度修改，在全军文艺调演中搬上舞台，对人物内心的开掘、音乐唱腔的出新和舞美设计等方面都有新创造。扮演范睢的演员是辛宝达（左），演须贾的演员为刘金泉（右）。	程更新摄
