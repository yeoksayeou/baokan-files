The Liujiang River is a small river in the northern part of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It branches off from the Qianjiang River, which runs through the central and eastern parts of the autonomous region, at a place called Shilong, and flows northward all the way to Guizhou. Liuzhou is located on the banks of this river.

This is a beautiful river. The areas it flows through are hilly and scenic, but they are also impoverished. This is why the famous Tang Dynasty poet Liu Zongyuan was exiled here in ancient China.

In old China, this area was the kingdom of some local tyrants—landlords combined with bandits. Under the primitive mode of production, they had to use coercive measures to exploit the peasants ruthlessly to create wealth for their own extravagance. This kind of exploitation could only be eradicated through land reform. This was the first major task undertaken after the founding of New China.

This region was liberated the latest, and after liberation, it went through a period of eliminating bandits, so land reform started the latest here as well. But precisely because it was "late," the land reform experience accumulated in other regions and the policies summarized based on these experiences could be used as a reference and guiding principle for work in this region.

Another feature is that the land reform here involved a large number of intellectuals. A group of land reform work teams, including the author, led by Yang Hansheng, the head of the "National Political Consultative Conference's Central South Region Land Reform Team 20," began work here in 1951 and ended in the summer of 1952. There were more than 120 participants, all from the fields of science, culture, education, health, and women's work, many of whom were famous scholars, experts, and high-level intellectuals who had just returned from abroad. Such a team coming here to do this work was also "unprecedented."

For these gentle scholars, this was also an extraordinary experience in their lives.

Now, 37 or 38 years have passed. Looking back at the miserable situation of the peasants who were barely clothed and had no food for the next meal, the changes now are truly earth-shattering. The population of our country has nearly doubled compared to that time, and this region is no exception. But now, everyone not only has enough to eat, but their clothing has also changed, especially women—they are dressed more beautifully than ever. As a symbol of "modern civilization," color TVs and tape recorders have also entered the daily lives of farmers here. The past days, for today's rural youth, are probably already a myth. The land reform carried out at that time and the complex struggles that took place during the land reform are even more unimaginable to them. But for us who are still alive, the situation at that time is still vivid in our minds. What was ordinary at that time has now become a rare experience. "Liujiang Angry Waves" is a collection of memories written by those who participated in this unprecedented land struggle.

These authors include local land reform leaders at that time, intellectuals from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, many of whom are now nationally renowned scientists, professors, medical workers, writers, painters, poets, and translators. These comrades are now mostly over 70 or approaching 70, and today, recalling the scenes of that time, they cannot help but feel a sense of being from a different era.

It is precisely because of this that these memories may be very fresh to today's readers. The author had this fresh feeling when reading these works. If the content of these works is linked to the lives and careers of these authors, readers may gain a deeper understanding of these people who have dedicated their lives to Chinese culture and science, and perhaps even gain some inspiration from them. Because these memories are the records and feelings of these authors about the events and their own experiences at that time. In this sense, they have historical significance beyond general factual reports—the transformation and change of intellectuals in a great era.

This collection consists of six parts. The overall content is, of course, land reform, but because the aspects reflected in these articles are different, the division into groups makes the content more prominent and striking. In terms of expression, some are theoretical and policy-oriented narratives—this type of article is relatively small in quantity, and the vast majority are recollections, memoirs, and essays, as well as poems, sketches of land reform life and characters, and other artistic works. Particularly valuable are the diaries of Comrade Yang Hansheng about the entire land reform process—here only the important parts are selected. All the articles, although written by comrades who are active in different fields of life and work, have a common characteristic, that is, a strong artistic quality, so they are also works with appreciation value.

In such a vast country as China, this land reform, which liberated the productive forces of hundreds of millions of peasants, completed the first groundbreaking work in the history of building socialism in China. In world history, the elimination of the feudal exploitation system that had shackled hundreds of millions of peasants for thousands of years was also an unprecedented event.

There are not many works about this great event now, and works that describe this great event from the personal emotions and perceptions of the participants, written by so many intellectuals, and with considerable literary value, can be said to be unique. Edited by Yang Hansheng, with Jia Zhi and Wu Tang as deputy editors, and published by Guangxi People's Publishing House, "Liujiang Angry Waves" is such a work. I believe it has important historical significance.

    往事可追忆
    叶君健
    柳江是广西壮族自治区偏北的一条小江。它从横贯自治区中东部的黔江在一个叫做石龙的地方分支出来，一直向北流，直到贵州。柳州就在这条江的边上。
    这是一条美丽的江。它所流过的区域山陵起伏，风景清秀，但就是贫困。因此我国唐代著名诗人柳宗元才被贬到这里。
    在旧中国，这里是一些土皇帝——地主加土匪——的王国。在原始生产方式的情况下，他们要使农民在那贫瘠的土地上创造出足以供他们挥霍的财富，那就必然要用高压手段来进行残酷的剥削。这种剥削只有土改才可以根除。这就是新中国成立以后在这里做的第一件大事。
    这个地区解放得最晚，解放后又经历了一段清匪的过程，所以土改也开始得最晚。但正是由于“晚”，过去在其他地区所积累的土改经验和根据这些经验所归纳出来的政策，却可以作为这个地区工作的借鉴和指导方针。
    另一个特点是：这里所进行的土改有大批知识分子参加。一批包括笔者在内的土改工作团——全名为“全国政协中南区土改第二十团”，在阳翰笙团长的率领之下，于1951年在这里展开工作，1952年夏天结束。参加者有120多人，都来自科学、文化、教育、卫生和妇女工作等各个领域，其中不少是著名学者、专家和刚从国外回来的高级知识分子。这样一支队伍，到此来做这项工作也算是“空前”的吧。
    对于这些文质彬彬的书生来说，这也是他们一生不平凡的经历。
    现在，三十七八年的光阴过去了。回想当时农民衣不蔽体、吃了上顿没有下顿的悲惨景况，现在的变化真是翻天覆地。我国现在的人口比当时增加了将近两倍，这个地区也不例外。但现在大家不仅能吃饱饭，甚至衣着也起了变化，特别是妇女——她们穿得比任何时候都漂亮。作为“现代文明”的标记之一的彩电和收录机也进入了这里农民的日常生活。过去的日子，对现在的农村青年说来，恐怕已经成了神话。当时所进行的土改和在土改过程中所展开的复杂的斗争，他们更是无法想象。但我们现存的人，想起当时的景况，仍然是历历在目。把它们记下来，在当时可能是最平凡不过的事，现在却是稀有的经历了。《柳江怒涛》就是当时参加这场前所未有的土地斗争的人写的一些回忆。
    这些作者包括当时地方上的土改领导干部、北京和上海等地去的知识分子，其中不少是现在全国知名的科学家、教授、医务工作者、作家、画家、诗人、翻译家。这些同志现在大都已经过了古稀或接近古稀之年，今天再回忆当时的情景，不免或有隔世之感。
    正因为如此，这些回忆，对今天的读者也许很新鲜。笔者在读这些作品的时候就有这种新鲜感。如果把这些作品的内容，联系到这些作者的生平及其事业来看，读者对这些在中国文化和科学上贡献出一生精力的人或许还能获得更深的理解，甚至从中得到某些启发，因为这些回忆是现在的这些作者们对于当时所发生的事态和各自经历的实录和感受。从这一点上讲，它们又具有超乎一般事实报道的历史意义——知识分子在一个大时代中的改造和变化。
    这个集子由六个部分所组成。总的内容当然是土改，但是因为这些文章所反映的方面不同，分成组就使内容显得更为醒目、更为突出。就表现形式而言，有的是理论和政策性的叙述——这类的文章的分量较少，绝大部分是回忆、纪事和感想式的散文，还有些是诗、土改生活和人物的速写等美术作品。特别可贵的是阳翰笙同志有关整个土改过程的日记——这里只是节选其中的重要部分。所有的文章，尽管都出自一些活跃在不同生活领域和工作岗位上的同志们的手笔，但却具有一个共同特点，即浓厚的艺术性，因而它们也是具有欣赏价值的读物。
    在中国这样一个庞大的国家所进行的这场解放亿万农民生产力的土改，划时代地完成了第一次在中国历史上建设社会主义大厦的破土工程。在世界历史上，一举消灭束缚着亿万农民的几千年的封建剥削制度，也是一件破天荒的大事。
    关于这件大事的著作现在并不是太多，而从参与者自己的感情和感性出发来描绘这件大事，由那么多知识分子来执笔写成，并且具有较大的文学性的著作，可以说更是绝无仅有。由阳翰笙任主编，贾芝、吴塘任副主编，广西人民出版社出版的《柳江怒涛》作为这样一部著作，我以为具有重要的历史意义。
