Currently, many government organizations are focusing on government transparency and strengthening the constraint mechanism in their efforts to build a clean government. The results show that this approach has won the hearts of the people and should be persistently and solidly implemented.

Government transparency is a manifestation of socialist democracy and an important part of government building. In our country, all power belongs to the people. The people exercise their power to manage state and social affairs through two main channels: the organization of people's congresses at various levels and grassroots democratic life. At the grassroots level, for the people to effectively exercise their management rights and improve their ability to participate in politics, they must first understand the activities of local government organizations, especially major issues and those that directly affect the people's interests. In our country, the people are the masters of the state. The policies, guidelines, and goals set by the Party and government in a given period must be understood by the people and realized through their efforts. This requires that the activities of the Party and government in this regard be made public. Now, with the deepening of reform and opening up and the people's increasing concern for their own rights and interests, we face various social interests and conflicts that need to be coordinated and resolved, and various challenges in the construction of the four modernizations that need to be overcome. If various levels of organizations can do a good job in government transparency, the people will come up with ideas and solutions, work together with the Party and government, and strive for common goals. Government transparency helps to strengthen the sense of public service among government organizations and public servants, improve work efficiency, and overcome bureaucratism. The people's government is for the people. However, when it comes to a specific region, unit, or leader and staff member, what they have done for the people throughout the year and the results of their work vary. Through government transparency, each matter and each public servant will be exposed to the public and subject to public supervision. Government organizations and public servants will feel a sense of pressure, thereby enhancing their sense of responsibility and self-discipline, using their power properly, and serving the people well. It has been proven that corrupt officials who take bribes and engage in malpractice, officials who only hold positions but do not work, and those with serious bureaucratism, as well as mediocre and incompetent officials, are most afraid of government transparency; while officials who wholeheartedly serve the people welcome government transparency. Therefore, we should also take government transparency as a system to assess the performance of organizations and officials at all levels.

Various places have adopted multiple methods in government transparency, such as: disclosing the names, addresses, phone numbers, and staff names of administrative offices, disclosing administrative procedures, disclosing administrative results, holding press conferences, and soliciting opinions through symposiums, etc., which have been supported by the people. Regardless of the method adopted, it is necessary to ensure smooth communication channels, improve work efficiency, promote various tasks, and avoid formalism. Of course, while we advocate for government transparency, we must also consider the degree of openness. We should not disclose state secrets or create factors that lead to instability.

### 公开政务　搞好工作

    公开政务　搞好工作
    当前，许多政权组织在廉政建设中，狠抓政务公开，强化制约机制。从效果看，这一问题抓了得人心，应坚持不懈、扎扎实实抓下去。
    政务公开，是社会主义民主的一种体现，是政权建设的重要内容。在我国，一切权力属于人民。人民行使管理国家事务和社会事务的权力，一方面通过各级人民代表大会的组织形式，一方面通过基层民主生活的途径。在基层，人民要行使好管理权，提高参政议政的能力，首先要对地方政权组织的政务活动有个了解，尤其对重大的事情、关系群众切身利益的事情要充分了解。在我国，人民群众又是国家的主人，党和政府在一个时期所制定的方针、政策和奋斗目标，要为人民群众理解，并经过人民群众的努力去实现，这就需要将党和政府有关这方面的活动公之于众。现在，随着改革开放的深入和群众对自身权益的更加关心，我们面临着各种不同的社会利益和矛盾需要协调解决，面临着四化建设中的各种难题需要克服，如果各级组织搞好了政务公开，人民群众就会出主意、想办法，与党和政府同心同德，为之奋斗。政务公开，有利于增强政权组织和公职人员的公仆意识，提高办事效率，克服官僚主义。人民政权为人民。但是，具体到一个地区、一个单位、一个领导干部和工作人员，一年到头到底为人民群众做了些什么事，效果如何，情况各异。通过政务公开，让那一桩桩事情、一个个公职人员在群众面前亮相，接受群众的监督，政权组织和公职人员就会感到一种压力，从而增强责任感和自我约束力，用好权，服好务。事实证明，那些贪脏枉法、有腐败行为的干部，那些只当官不干事、有着严重官僚主义的干部，那些平庸无能、没有实绩的干部，最怕政务公开；而那些全心全意为人民服务的干部最欢迎政务公开。所以，我们还要把政务公开作为考核一级组织和干部的制度来抓。
    各地在公开政务中，采取了多种方式。如：公开办事机构（单位名称、地址、电话号码、工作人员姓名等），公开办事制度，公开办事效果，召开新闻发布会、征求意见座谈会等等，受到群众的拥护。不管采取什么方式，必须保证上下渠道畅通，提高办事效率，促进各项工作，不要搞花架子。当然，我们提倡政务公开，还要有个适度问题，不能泄露国家机密，不能制造不安定的因素。
