According to reports from our correspondents in Cairo and Addis Ababa, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Chedli Klibi, made a statement, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) issued a communiqué, both praising the peace agreement signed by Libya and Chad on August 31 to resolve the Ouzou dispute.

Klibi, in a statement issued on September 1 from the Arab League headquarters in Tunis, expressed satisfaction with the peace agreement. He noted that the agreement is a result of the positive development of relations between the two neighboring countries.

Klibi also commended Algeria's efforts in mediating the peace agreement between Libya and Chad.

Meanwhile, a message from Addis Ababa reported that the OAU issued a communiqué on September 1 stating that the Libya-Chad peace agreement demonstrates that Africans can resolve their own internal problems.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Yaoundé on September 2, Chad Radio broadcasted on September 1 that, following the orders of Chad's Head of State Hissène Habré, the Chadian authorities released a batch of Libyan prisoners of war.

These prisoners of war were released on August 31, following the signing of the peace agreement between the two countries in Algiers to resolve their border disputes. The Chad Radio broadcast noted that the release of Libyan prisoners of war was a gesture of goodwill from the Chadian side on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Libyan Revolution on September 1.
