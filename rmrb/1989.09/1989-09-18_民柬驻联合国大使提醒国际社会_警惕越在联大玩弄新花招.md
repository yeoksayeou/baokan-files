Khmer Rouge Representative to the UN Warns International Community to Beware of Vietnamese Tricks at the UNGA

According to Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, September 15th (reporter Qian Wenrong): Democratic Kampuchea's representative to the United Nations, Sieng Houp Phat, today warned the international community to be wary of Vietnam's new deceptive tactics at the upcoming 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Sieng Houp Phat told Xinhua News Agency in an exclusive interview that Vietnam's claim to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September 26th is difficult to believe because there is no international supervision of the withdrawal. He also said that Vietnam might deny the legitimacy of the Khmer Rouge government and attempt to have the Phnom Penh regime seize Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.

Sieng Houp Phat believes that the vast majority of UN member states will oppose Vietnam's aforementioned attempts. It is well known that the Phnom Penh regime was propped up by foreign troops, and the United Nations cannot accept it.

Regarding the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which concluded on August 30th, Sieng Houp Phat said that because Vietnam refused to allow the United Nations to supervise its withdrawal from Cambodia and the formation of a four-party interim government led by Prince Sihanouk, this conference did not reach any agreement.

Sieng Houp Phat said that Vietnam's refusal to accept these two key points once again shows that it lacks sincerity in politically resolving the Cambodian issue.

　　民柬驻联合国大使提醒国际社会
　　警惕越在联大玩弄新花招
    据新华社联合国9月15日电　（记者钱文荣）民主柬埔寨驻联合国大使秀蒲拉西今天提醒国际社会警惕越南在即将召开的第44届联合国大会上玩弄新的欺骗花招。
    秀蒲拉西在接受新华社记者专访时说，越南声称在9月26日前将它的全部军队撤出柬埔寨是很难令人相信的，因为撤军没有国际监督。他还说，越南可能会否定民柬政府的合法性，试图让金边政权窃取柬埔寨在联合国的席位。
    秀蒲拉西相信联合国绝大多数成员国将反对越南的上述企图。因为众所周知，金边政权是由外国军队扶植起来的，联合国不可能接受它。
    在谈到于8月30日闭幕的柬问题巴黎国际会议时，秀蒲拉西说，由于越南拒绝由联合国监督它从柬埔寨撤军和在过渡时期成立以西哈努克亲王为首的4方联合政府，本届会议没有达成任何协议。
    秀蒲拉西说，越南拒不接受上述两个关键之点，再次表明它在政治解决柬埔寨问题上没有诚意。
