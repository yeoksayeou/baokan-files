Li Peng Meets Ito in Shenyang, Hopes for Continued Development of Sino-Japanese Friendship
Same Day Meets Japanese Businessman Fukagawa Ben

	Shenyang, September 17 (Xinhua) - Premier Li Peng of the State Council met today in Shenyang with Ito Seigyo, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union, who was invited by the China-Japan Friendship Association to visit China.

	Li Peng, on behalf of the Chinese government, welcomed the visit of Ito and his delegation, and happily recalled the friendly reception he received from Mr. Ito during his visit to Japan in April this year.

	Ito expressed his great pleasure that Premier Li Peng took the time to meet him and his colleagues during his inspection work in Shenyang. Ito conveyed the greetings of Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki to Premier Li Peng. Ito said that before he left Japan for this visit, Prime Minister Kaifu expressed his personal importance on Sino-Japanese relations and hoped that Ito's visit would be a meaningful one for the development of bilateral relations.

	Li Peng wished Ito a successful visit to China and hoped that it would contribute to the development of Sino-Japanese relations. He welcomed more Japanese friends from all walks of life to come to China to see for themselves.

	Li Peng said that Sino-Japanese friendly relations are hard-won, and we do not want to see them damaged, but hope that they will continue to develop.

	When talking about the recent turmoil and riots in Beijing, Li Peng said that with the passage of time, Japanese friends will understand the truth of the matter, because facts are facts. Ito said that this incident is China's internal affair.

	Li Peng emphasized that China will adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and China's door is open to the world, including Western countries. The current problem is that some Western countries are interfering in China's internal affairs and exerting pressure on China. However, it is clear that the Chinese people cherish the socialist system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and will not trade this for anything. At the same time, China's cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries, including trade, technological cooperation, and loans, are mutually beneficial and not just beneficial to one side. In the future, China will continue to improve the investment environment and continue to develop economic and technological cooperation with various countries.

	He said that the Chinese government is a government that is responsible to the people, a stable government, and a government that adheres to principles. We still believe that the overall situation in the world has not changed, and the two major themes facing us are still peace and development. China's main goal is to achieve the four modernizations, and it pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy, willing to coexist peacefully with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

	Shenyang, September 17 (Xinhua) - Premier Li Peng of the State Council met today in Shenyang with Fukagawa Ben, the first vice president of Taisei Corporation, and his wife.

	Fukagawa Ben expressed that Taisei Corporation's desire to develop economic cooperation with China is sincere, and the purpose of this visit is to further explore the possibility of developing cooperation.

	Li Peng welcomed the guests and introduced the situation of China's economic development and the current focus of industrial construction. He appreciated Taisei Corporation's positive attitude towards developing Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and hoped that the two sides would further expand cooperation in various fields, including the construction industry.

　  李鹏在沈阳会见伊东时说
　　希望中日友好关系继续发展
    同日会见日本企业家府川勉
    新华社沈阳9月17日电　国务院总理李鹏今天下午在沈阳会见了应中日友协邀请来华访问的日中友好议员联盟会长伊东正义一行。
    李鹏代表中国政府对伊东一行访华表示欢迎，并愉快地回顾今年4月访日时伊东先生对他的友好接待。
    伊东对李鹏总理在视察工作的过程中抽时间在沈阳会见他和他的同事表示非常高兴。伊东转达了海部俊树首相对李鹏总理的问候。伊东说，他此次离日来华前，海部首相表示他本人重视对华关系，并希望伊东此行成为对两国关系有意义的一次访问。
    李鹏预祝伊东此次访华取得成功，对中日关系的发展作出贡献。他欢迎更多的日本各界朋友来中国实地看一看。
    李鹏说，中日友好关系来之不易，我们不愿看到它受到损害，而希望它继续向前发展。
    在谈到不久之前北京发生的动乱和暴乱时，李鹏说，随着时间的推移，日本朋友是会了解事情的真相的，因为事实终归是事实。伊东表示，这一事件是中国内部事务。
    李鹏强调，中国将坚持改革开放政策，中国的大门向世界各国开放，也包括向西方国家开放。现在的问题是，有些西方国家在干涉中国的内政，向中国施加压力。但是很清楚，中国人民十分珍惜自己在中国共产党领导下实行的社会主义制度，决不会拿这一点做交易。同时，中国同外国进行的合作与交流，包括贸易及技术合作和贷款在内，是互惠互利的，不只是仅对一方有利。今后中国将继续改善投资环境，继续同各国发展经济技术合作。
    他说，中国政府是对人民负责的政府、稳定的政府、坚持原则的政府。我们现在仍然认为，世界总的形势没有改变，当前面临的还是和平与发展两大主题。中国以实现四个现代化为自己的主要目标，对外坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国友好相处。
    据新华社沈阳9月17日电　国务院总理李鹏今天下午在沈阳会见了日本大成建设株式会社第一副社长府川勉和夫人。
