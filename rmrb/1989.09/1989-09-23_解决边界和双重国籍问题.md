Establishing and developing friendly neighborly relations with neighboring countries is an important principle of New China's diplomacy. China's harmonious coexistence with its neighbors and efforts to ease international tensions are also beneficial for domestic construction. China believes that historical border issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to force. During negotiations, both historical contexts and existing realities should be considered, and necessary adjustments can be made with mutual agreement. Before resolution, the status quo of the border should be maintained. Based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendship, China has resolved border issues fairly and reasonably with some neighboring countries in the 1960s. On October 1, 1960, China signed the "Sino-Burmese Border Treaty" with Myanmar. On October 5, 1961, China signed the "Sino-Nepal Border Treaty" with Nepal. On December 26, 1962, China signed the "Sino-Mongolian Border Treaty" with Mongolia. On March 2, 1963, China signed the "Agreement Between the Governments of China and Pakistan on the Boundary Question Between the Sinkiang-Tibet Region of China and the Areas of Pakistan under Actual Control" with Pakistan. On November 22, 1963, China signed the "Sino-Afghan Border Treaty" with Afghanistan.

To address the issue of dual nationality among overseas Chinese due to differing nationality laws in some countries where they reside, the Chinese government has put forward its stance: there should not be dual nationality. An overseas Chinese who wishes to acquire the nationality of the country where they reside should renounce their Chinese nationality, and if they wish to retain their Chinese nationality, they should no longer be considered a citizen of the country where they reside. The Chinese government hopes that overseas Chinese will voluntarily choose the nationality of the country where they reside and obtain citizenship there. If they choose Chinese nationality, they should also respect the laws of the country where they reside, not participate in local political activities, but their legitimate rights and interests should be respected and protected. Based on the above principles, the Chinese government has dealt with various situations in a realistic and differentiated manner and gradually resolved the issue of dual nationality with some neighboring countries.

    解决边界和双重国籍问题
        同邻国建立和发展睦邻友好关系，是新中国外交的一项重要方针。中国与四邻和睦相处，争取国际形势缓和，也有利于国内建设。中国认为，对历史遗留的边界问题，应通过和平谈判，求得友好解决，而不应诉诸武力；在谈判中，既要照顾过去的历史背景，又要照顾已经形成的实际情况，经双方同意也可以作必要的调整；在解决前，应维持边界现状。按照上述平等、互利、友好的原则，中国同一些邻国在六十年代公平合理地解决了边界问题；一九六○年十月一日同缅甸签订《中缅边界条约》；一九六一年十月五日同尼泊尔签订《中尼边界条约》；一九六二年十二月二十六日同蒙古签订《中蒙边界条约》；一九六三年三月二日同巴基斯坦签订《中巴两国政府关于中国新疆和巴基斯坦实际控制其防务的地区之间的边界问题的协定》；一九六三年十一月二十二日同阿富汗签订《中国阿富汗边界条约》。
    为解决由于历史上一些华侨所在国同中国的国籍法遵循的立法原则不同所造成的华侨双重国籍问题，中国政府提出了自己的主张：不应该有双重国籍；一个华侨要取得所在国国籍，他就应该放弃中国国籍，如果愿意保留中国国籍，他就不再是所在国公民；中国政府希望华侨自愿选择所在国国籍，取得所在国公民资格。如果他们选择中国国籍，也应当尊重所在国的法律，不参加当地的政治活动，但他们的正当权益应该受到尊重和保护。中国政府依据上述原则，实事求是地区别对待各种不同情况，同一些邻国逐步解决了华侨双重国籍问题。
