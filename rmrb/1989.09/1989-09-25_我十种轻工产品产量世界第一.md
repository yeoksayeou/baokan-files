    China's Production of 10 Light Industrial Products Ranks First in the World

    According to a report from our newspaper, in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's light industry has achieved rapid development. It has formed a complete and interrelated production system, becoming a pillar industry in China's national economy. Currently, the production of salt, refrigerators, washing machines, electric fans, sewing machines, bicycles, electric rice cookers, electric irons, pencils, ballpoint pens, and canned mushrooms ranks first in the world. Over the past 40 years, the light industry sector has completed a total output value of 2364.7 billion yuan across more than 40 industries, paid 529.78 billion yuan in taxes, and earned 61 billion US dollars in foreign exchange through exports. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the light industry has introduced hundreds of new products, thousands of new varieties, and tens of thousands of new styles to the market each year.
