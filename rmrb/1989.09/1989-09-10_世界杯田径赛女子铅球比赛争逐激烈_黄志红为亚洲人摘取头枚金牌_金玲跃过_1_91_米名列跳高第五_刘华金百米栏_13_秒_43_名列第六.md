Xinhua News Agency, Barcelona, September 9th - (Reporters Gao Dianmin and Zhang Mingde) The fifth World Cup Athletics Championships, currently taking place here, saw a series of thrilling moments today as athletes set four new World Cup records. Chinese athlete Huang Zhi Hong won the first gold medal for the Asian team in the women's shot put event, marking the first time an Asian athlete has won a gold medal since the World Cup began in 1977.

The women's shot put competition started just after 7 PM. Participants included the gold medalist from the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Lisoftskaya from the Soviet Union, and the world's top-ranked athlete this year, Hartwich from East Germany. At 24 years old, Huang Zhi Hong threw 20.30 meters on her second attempt. Hartwich was close behind, throwing 20.62 meters on her final attempt. Huang Zhi Hong, appearing relaxed and cheerful, took her final throw, sending the shot put to 20.73 meters. She finally defeated the world's best athletes and, as the first Asian team member, stood on the World Cup champion's podium. Hartwich finished second. Lisoftskaya only managed 19.76 meters, placing fourth.

In the 14 events, many top athletes fell short. All four World Cup records were set by women.

In the women's 10,000 meters, the world record holder Christianesen from Norway failed to win the title, losing to Ulrike from East Germany and finishing second. Ulrike won the gold medal with a time of 31:33.92, breaking the championship record. The women's high jump title went to Silva Costa from Cuba, who set a new championship record with a height of 2.04 meters. China's Jin Ling tied for fifth place with an American athlete, both jumping 1.91 meters.

The women's 800 meters saw a major upset, with Quirot from Cuba defeating the Olympic champion, Wodars from East Germany, and setting a new championship record. China's Sun Sumei ran 1:58.56 in the intense competition, breaking the national record of 2:01.39 set by Feng Yanbo on June 18.

East Germany's Oschknat won the women's 100-meter hurdles, setting a new championship record with a time of 12.60 seconds. China's Liu Huajin finished sixth with a time of 13.43 seconds.

    世界杯田径赛女子铅球比赛争逐激烈
　　黄志红为亚洲人摘取头枚金牌
　　金玲跃过1.91米名列跳高第五　刘华金百米栏13秒43名列第六
    新华社巴塞罗那9月9日电　（记者高殿民、张明德）正在这里举行的第五届世界杯田径赛今天高潮迭起，运动员们创造了4项新的世界杯赛纪录。中国选手黄志红在女子铅球比赛中为亚洲队夺得世界杯田径赛自1977年开始举办以来的首枚金牌。
    女子铅球比赛是今晚7时过后开始的。参加比赛的选手中有去年汉城奥运会冠军、苏联的利索夫斯卡娅，今年世界排名第一的民主德国选手哈特维希等。24岁的黄志红第二次试投时就投出了20米30，哈特维希紧追不舍，最后一次试投，掷出20米62。这时，黄志红显得轻松愉快，最后一次走进投掷圈，奋力一掷，铅球落到20米73处，终于战胜世界诸将，作为亚洲队的队员第一次登上了世界杯赛的冠军领奖台。哈特维希名列第二。利索夫斯卡娅仅以19米76获第四名。
    在14个项目的决赛中，不少名将纷纷落马。4项世界杯赛纪录全部在女子项目中产生。
    在女子1万米比赛中，世界纪录保持者克里斯蒂安森（挪威）夺取桂冠的希望破灭，这位世界长跑名将败在了民主德国选手乌尔里希手下，仅获得第二名。乌尔里希以31分33秒92夺得冠军并打破了大会纪录。女子跳高比赛的桂冠被古巴选手席尔瓦·科斯塔夺走，她以2米04的成绩打破了大会纪录。中国的金玲以1米91与美国选手并列第五名。
    女子800米比赛爆出大冷门，古巴的基罗特战胜了奥运会冠军、民主德国的沃达尔斯夺得金牌，并打破大会纪录。中国的孙素梅在强手竞争中，跑出了1分58秒56，打破了6月18日冯艳波创造的2分1秒39的全国纪录。
    民主德国的奥施克纳特夺得女子100米栏冠军，并以12秒60的成绩创下新的大会纪录。中国选手刘华金的成绩是13秒43，名列第六位。
