The fifth World Youth Men's Volleyball Championship opened today in Athens. The Chinese team lost their first match 1-3 to the Bulgarian team. The Bulgarian team had taller players on the court and a clear advantage at the net, with stable performance from their players. The Chinese team fought hard today, but due to many serving errors and not having the advantage at the net, they ultimately lost with scores of 8-15, 15-13, 7-15, and 7-15.

    世界青年男排锦标赛开幕
    我队首战负于保加利亚队
    新华社雅典9月3日电  第五届世界青年男排锦标赛今天在这里拉开战幕，中国队首战以1∶3负于保加利亚队。保队场上队员比中国队高，网上占有明显优势，队员发挥稳定。中国队今天奋力拚争，但由于发球失误多，又不占网上优势，终以8∶15、15∶13、7∶15和7∶15败北。
    参加本届锦标赛的共有16支球队，先分为4个组进行单循环赛。与中国队同在A组的希腊队以3∶1胜了西班牙队。今天进行的另5场比赛的结果是：B组，古巴队以3∶0胜波多黎各队；C组，日本队以3∶0胜阿根廷队、阿尔及利亚队以3∶2胜巴林队；D组，巴西队以3∶1胜波兰队、苏联队以3∶0胜印度尼西亚队。
    明天，中国队将迎战希腊队。
