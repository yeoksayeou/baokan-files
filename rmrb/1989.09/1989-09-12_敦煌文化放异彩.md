Socialist Undertakings March Forward

Dunhuang, with its rich history and brilliant ancient culture, boasts two national-level and eleven provincial-level cultural relics protection units. Today, it has truly regained the prosperity of its name, "Dun" meaning great, and "Huang" meaning flourishing.

The Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, established in the 4th century BC, are renowned worldwide for their murals. It was only after the liberation of the country that the study of Dunhuang art began to take shape. Starting in the 1980s, the Dunhuang Academy reinforced and repaired the caves, and conducted scientific preservation of the murals. Their achievement in using resin injection to permanently protect the peeling murals won the National Science and Technology Progress First Prize. Researchers also used chemical methods to clean the soot-blackened caves, restoring the original appearance and colors of numerous murals. The Dunhuang Research Academy, established in 1984, now has over a hundred professional researchers. After years of hard work, they have published several albums introducing the Mogao Caves. The academic journal "Dunhuang Studies," published by the academy, is distributed worldwide and has published over 200 unique papers. Today, China's research on Dunhuang studies has entered the world's forefront, reversing the previous phenomenon where "Dunhuang is in China, but Dunhuang studies are abroad."

Since the United Nations listed the Mogao Caves as a world cultural heritage site, Dunhuang culture has attracted even more attention. The famous landmarks represented by the Mogao Caves and the natural wonders represented by Crescent Lake and Echoing-Sand Mountain are captivating. The number of tourists visiting Dunhuang increases by 30% each year. In just ten years, Dunhuang's tourism industry has generated over 60 million yuan in total revenue. Last year alone, they hosted over 300,000 domestic and foreign visitors. The development of tourism has not only promoted and driven the development of Dunhuang's industrial and agricultural production but has also injected vitality into the restoration and development of traditional handicrafts. The city now has seven enterprises producing tourist souvenirs, with the production capacity of Dunhuang cultural and artistic handicrafts reaching thirteen categories and over 120 varieties. Twenty households in the village near Crescent Lake and Echoing-Sand Mountain have also collaborated with relevant units to raise funds and build the Dunhuang Folk Museum, allowing domestic and foreign tourists to learn about and study Dunhuang's history, culture, religious art, and customs.

　　敦煌文化放异彩
    如今，历史悠久、古文化灿烂辉煌，拥有两个国家级、十一个省级文物保护单位的敦煌，真正恢复了“敦，大也；煌，盛也”的繁荣景象。
    创建于公元前四世纪的敦煌莫高窟，是一座以壁画著称的世界艺术宝库。全国解放以后，敦煌艺术的研究才逐步展开。从八十年代开始，敦煌研究所加固修缮洞窟，对壁画进行科学保护。他们采用树脂注射对即将剥落的壁画进行永久性保护的成果，获得了国家科技进步一等奖。科研人员还用化学方法清洗烟火熏黑的洞窟，使众多的壁画恢复了原来的面貌和色彩。成立于一九八四年的敦煌研究院，现在已有各种专业研究人员一百多名。经过几年的辛勤努力，他们编印了一批介绍莫高窟的画册。研究院创办的《敦煌研究》学刊向全世界发行，已发表有独特见解的论文二百多篇。现在，中国关于敦煌学的研究已进入世界先进行列，曾被外国人称之为“敦煌在中国，敦煌学在国外”的现象已经得到彻底改变。
    自从联合国将莫高窟列为世界性的文化遗产以后，敦煌文化格外引人注目。以莫高窟为代表的名胜古迹和以月牙泉、鸣沙山为代表的自然奇观令人心驰神往。前来敦煌旅游观光的游客，每年以百分之三十的幅度递增。十年时间，敦煌市旅游事业总收入达六千多万元。仅去年，他们就接待中外宾客三十多万人次。旅游业的发展，不仅促进和带动了敦煌市工农业生产的发展，而且给传统手工艺品的恢复和发展注入了活力。全市已有七家生产旅游纪念品的企业，具有敦煌文化艺术特色的工艺美术品生产能力已发展到十三大类一百二十多个品种。地处鸣沙山下月牙泉村的二十户农民，还和有关单位联合筹集资金，修建起了敦煌民俗博物馆，供中外游客了解和研究敦煌历史文化、宗教艺术、风俗民情。（杨德禄）
