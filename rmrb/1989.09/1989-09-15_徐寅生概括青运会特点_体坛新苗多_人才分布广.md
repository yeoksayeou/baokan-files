The reporter Wang Dazhao reports from Shenyang on September 15th: Deputy Director of the State Sports Commission Xu Yinsheng said at the Youth Games Organizing Committee meeting this morning that the main characteristics of this sports meet can be summarized as: a large number of participants, and the popularity and average level of talents have improved. The current problem with the youth team is that training lacks scientific methods, basic skills are not solid, and there are few elite athletes.

At this Youth Games, one world record and three Asian records were broken, four national records were set, and a batch of world youth records, national youth records, and national junior records were created or exceeded. Xu Yinsheng pointed out that the number of participating athletes has increased significantly compared to previous events, and the phenomenon of a lack of reserves in Chinese sports may be alleviated. The physical, mental, and psychological qualities of young athletes are more obvious than in the previous Youth Games. The situation where talents are concentrated in a few provinces has improved, and some remote provinces have competitive strength in certain projects, such as Shaanxi's rowing, Henan's swimming, Heilongjiang and Yunnan's gymnastics, and Guizhou's fencing. Some female gymnasts and judo athletes have reached or are close to the Asian or world level. Many athletes' mental state and tenacious spirit on the field are deeply moving.

Xu Yinsheng said that due to the influence of short-term behavior and seeking quick results, some projects, in order to be practical, focus on high difficulty in technology and tactics, and do not pay attention to basic skills training. Some track and field athletes have deformed movements during competitions; fencers have single movements; in the 67.5 kg weightlifting, most team members cannot lift the weight they can usually lift; in the rowing final, there were more than 40 off-course incidents and more than 10 boats with inconsistent oar strokes, and the tactical intentions were not fully implemented.

Xu Yinsheng said that how to scientifically and reasonably train a large number of promising young athletes is the main task facing the sports community.

　　徐寅生概括青运会特点
  　体坛新苗多　人才分布广
    本报沈阳九月十五日电　记者汪大昭报道：国家体委副主任徐寅生今天上午在青运会组委会会议上说，这次运动会的主要特点可以概括为：参赛人数多，人才的普及面及水平均有提高。当前青少年队伍普遍存在的问题是训练缺乏科学性，基本功欠扎实，尖子队员少。
    本届青运会上，共超一项世界纪录和三项亚洲纪录，创四项全国纪录，还创造或超过了一批世界青年纪录和全国青年纪录以及全国少年纪录。徐寅生指出，参赛选手数量比以前有较大幅度的增加，我国体坛后备匮乏的现象可能将有所缓和。青少年运动员身材、体能、心理素质较明显地优于上届青运会。人才集中出于少数省份的局面有所改观，一些边远省份有的项目具备了竞争实力，如陕西的赛艇、河南的游泳、黑龙江和云南的体操、贵州的击剑等。女子体操和柔道部分选手已达到或接近亚洲或世界水平。许多运动员赛场上的精神状态和顽强作风使人深受感动。
    徐寅生说，由于受急功近利、短期行为的影响，一些项目为讲求实惠，技术、战术上单纯追求高难度，不重视基本功的训练。有的田径运动员在比赛中动作变形；击剑运动员动作单一；六十七点五公斤级抓举，多数队员举不起平时可以举起的重量；赛艇决赛中四十多次偏航和十多条艇桨幅不一致，贯彻战术意图心有余力不足。
    徐寅生说，如何对一大批有希望的青少年运动员进行科学合理的训练，是体育界面临的主要任务。
