The State Ethnic Affairs Commission's Minister, Sīmǎ Yì·Àimàidì, told reporters this morning that the situation in national minority regions across the country is excellent, with the national economy continuously developing, national unity continuously strengthening, and all ethnic groups striving forward. He also informed reporters that, under the care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission will undertake six initiatives during the 40th anniversary celebrations of National Day:

	— Hold a national conference on poverty alleviation in minority regions in late September in Beijing. This conference is a key initiative by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission based on the Party's central tasks in the new era and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. It holds significant importance for accelerating the economic development of minority regions, strengthening national unity, and promoting border stability.

	— Organize a National Day performance by minority nationalities' artists. Artists from all 55 minority nationalities across the country will gather in Beijing for the first time to perform together.

	— Organize a National Day visiting delegation of minority nationalities. Participants are all advanced individuals who have made contributions to the cause of national unity and progress, including representatives from all 56 ethnic groups and various minority regions.

	— Hold a national exhibition and sale of ethnic products and famous, special, and excellent products from minority regions during the National Day period.

	— On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, it is planned to issue certificates of honor to colleagues in the commission's system who have worked in ethnic affairs for more than 30 years. The certificates of honor will be divided into two categories: "30 Years of Ethnic Work" and "40 Years of Ethnic Work."

	— Hold a summary meeting for the State Ethnic Affairs Commission's five series of books. The "five series of books" is an important historical documentation project for ethnic work, which has now been successfully completed and is a tribute to the 40th anniversary of National Day.
