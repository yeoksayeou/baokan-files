**Egyptian Correspondence**

It is still dark outside. The Ali Baba Coffee Shop in Cairo opens early, but there are only two or three early customers. The upstairs is divided into two rooms. The right room has windows on two sides, and the orange-yellow stained glass blocks out the bustling scene outside, creating a quiet oasis in the midst of the city.

Egyptian coffee shops usually only serve coffee, sweetened red tea, and hookah. They also provide a game similar to Chinese mahjong for customers to enjoy. The patrons are from all walks of life, and the topics of conversation are vast.

Observing interpersonal interactions, exploring various aspects of society, and peeking into the human psyche—this is the unique path that the great Egyptian writer Najib Mahfouz takes in his literary creation.

He arrives. Dressed in a light green spring-autumn suit, no tie, black leather shoes. The 78-year-old writer walks into the coffee shop he has visited every morning for more than a decade, sitting in the first seat by the window in the right room upstairs. Today, he is no different from usual. He buys seven newspapers on the way, orders two cups of fragrant, steaming Turkish coffee, and then buries his head in the papers. What surprises the reporter is that he starts reading from the back page. A sketch of him by a foreign friend hanging on the wall next to his seat is exactly the posture he is in now while reading the newspaper.

The reporter tries to find traces of the old Cairo life described in his writings on the face of this Arab literary giant. Throughout his life, he has created 50 novels and more than 100 short stories and plays. The most brilliant strokes in his works are the vivid depictions of the lives of the lower-class people in the old Arab cities. The trilogy "Between the Palaces," "The Palace of Desire," and "Sugar Street" describes the changes in the lives of three generations of a merchant family in old Cairo, "comparable to Dickens' London, Zola's Paris, and Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg." Last October, the Royal Swedish Academy awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, praising his works for their realistic style and their reflection of the emotions and memories of the Arab people.

The reporter approaches the old writer to introduce himself and have a conversation. Mahfouz responds in a friendly and calm manner.

"Has your life changed since winning the award?"

"Just the same as before."

"Do you have any new writing plans?"

"I've stopped writing."

The literary giant seems not very talkative, but more precisely, he does not want reporters to write more about him, disturbing his otherwise peaceful later years.

When the reporter tells him that there are many enthusiastic readers of his works in China and that China is translating and studying his works, a smile appears on the old man's face. He recalls reading Chinese translated novels and apologizes, "I'm sorry, I've forgotten the author's name."

After all, this is just a casual chat in a coffee shop. Mahfouz quickly turns the topic to coffee and coffee shops. He says he has almost been to every coffee shop in Cairo and made many friends. An Egyptian magazine says Mahfouz is a literary giant cultivated by the coffee shops of Cairo in the 1930s and 1940s. His own statement is even clearer: "Coffee shops are the source of my creative inspiration." As he leaves, he suggests to the reporter, "Spend some time in the coffee shops."

The coffee has cooled, but the fragrance remains. Around nine o'clock, a car from the Al-Ahram newspaper comes to pick up the old writer to go to work.

    文豪与咖啡馆
    本报记者　林皎明
    天蒙蒙亮。开罗阿里巴巴咖啡馆很早就开了张，但只有两三位早客。楼上分作两间，右间两面有窗，橙黄色的刻花玻璃挡住了外面的繁景，成为闹中取静的小天地。
    埃及咖啡店通常只供应咖啡、加糖红茶和水烟。另备类似中国麻将的游戏骨牌供人消遣。坐客三教九流，话题海阔天空。
    在咖啡馆揣摸人际交流，涉猎社会百态，窥探人的内心世界，正是埃及大文豪纳吉布·马夫兹文学创作的殊途。
    他来了。一身淡墨绿的春秋装，不打领带，黑色皮鞋。七十八岁高龄的老作家走进他十多年来每天清晨必到的咖啡馆，坐在楼上右间临窗第一张座位上。今天，他与往常没有多大不同。顺路买到七份日报，叫两客清香滚烫的土耳其咖啡，坐下来便埋头读报。令记者惊奇的是，他竟从报屁股看起。座旁墙上挂着的外国友人为他勾勒的速写，正是他现在读报的姿态。
    记者竭力想从这位阿拉伯文豪脸上找寻他笔下老开罗昔日生活的气息。他一生创作的五十部小说和一百多篇故事和剧本，最精彩的神来之笔就是维妙维肖地再现以往阿拉伯都市下层人士的生活。《两宫间》、《向往宫》、《甘露街》三部曲，描写的是老开罗商家三代人的变迁，“堪与狄更斯笔下的伦敦、左拉笔下的巴黎、陀斯妥耶夫斯基笔下的彼得堡媲美。”去年十月，瑞典皇家学院给他颁发诺贝尔文学奖，评定他的作品充满现实主义特色，反映出阿拉伯民族的情感和追忆特点。
    记者上前与老作家结识，叙谈。马夫兹和蔼、平淡地作答。
    “获奖后，您的生活有什么新的变化？”
    “和往常一样。”
    “您有新的写作计划吗？”
    “早歇笔了。”
    文豪看似不健谈，而确切地说，是不愿意有记者更多地写他，打搅他本该是很平静的晚年生活。
    当记者告诉他，中国也有他不少热心的读者，中国在翻译和研究他的作品时，老人的脸上露出笑容。他回忆起读过的中国翻译小说，并抱歉说，“很对不起，我忘记了作者的姓名。”
    毕竟是咖啡馆里的闲谈。马夫兹很快就谈到咖啡和咖啡馆。他说，他几乎跑遍开罗的咖啡馆，结识了众多的朋友。一家埃及杂志说马夫兹是开罗咖啡馆三十年代和四十年代培养出来的文豪。他的自我表白则更明确：“咖啡馆是我创作灵感的源泉。”临别，他建议记者“泡泡咖啡馆”。
    咖啡凉了，可清香依旧。近九时，《金字塔报》派车来接老作家“上班”去了。
