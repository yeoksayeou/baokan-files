Vice Premier Tian Jiyun met with a delegation from the Soviet Supreme Soviet, led by First Deputy Chairman Lyukyanov, this morning at the Great Hall of the People.

Tian Jiyun said that both China and the Soviet Union are currently implementing the various guidelines set forth during the high-level meeting between the two countries in May, moving forward on the path of friendship and cooperation.

He believes that China and the Soviet Union each have their strengths in economics, technology, and resources, making their cooperation highly complementary and full of potential. He hopes that through joint efforts, cooperation in the fields of economics, trade, and technology between the two countries can be further advanced.

Tian Jiyun expressed satisfaction with the development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries in recent years and believes that the prospects for cooperation are excellent. He expressed confidence that the visit of the Soviet delegation will promote the development of friendship and cooperation between the two sides. He also recalled his successful visit to the Soviet Union in July.

Lyukyanov said that both the Soviet Union and China indeed have the "common desire and favorable conditions" to further develop economic and trade cooperation. He emphasized that the two countries should not only develop general trade but also explore avenues for cooperative production.

When discussing reforms, Lyukyanov said that both the Soviet Union and China have encountered some difficulties in the process, which is "a very natural thing." He believes that these difficulties will definitely be overcome, and the superiority of the socialist system will be more fully demonstrated.
