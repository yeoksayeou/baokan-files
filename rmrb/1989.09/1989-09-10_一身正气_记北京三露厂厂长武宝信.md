In mid-May, as the turmoil in Beijing escalated with the rising summer heat, Beijing Sanlu Factory Director Wu Baoxin repeatedly emphasized at the factory's fourth-anniversary celebration and several management meetings: "China must follow the socialist path and uphold the leadership of the Communist Party." He also formally announced the "three no's" resolution: "Factory workers are not allowed to stop work or production, not allowed to participate in street protests, and not allowed to support students."

At that time, it took courage and resolve to say such words.

Why was Wu Baoxin so outspoken?

"Without reform and opening up, how could there be today's Sanlu Factory?"

On May 17, when tens of thousands of people in the capital took to the streets to protest, a small number of workers at Sanlu Factory also wanted to go to Tiananmen Square to support the students. Although the director had announced the "three no's," some people were still emotionally charged, and a few disabled workers also wanted to go to the streets. Wu Baoxin passionately told everyone: "Have you thought about it? Without the Communist Party and without reform and opening up, how could there be today's Sanlu Factory? Without a stable and united political situation, how could Sanlu Factory achieve year-on-year economic benefits? You should know that if workers go on strike, disasters such as water and electricity shortages and food shortages will occur. I sincerely ask everyone to stay at your posts and continue production."

From the outbreak of the turmoil in Beijing to the occurrence of the counter-revolutionary riot, Wu Baoxin, in addition to being in Beijing, also rushed between the branch factories in Zhuozhou and Zhuhai to direct production. He also went to Hong Kong and Singapore to organize the exhibition and sales of the Dabao series of cosmetics and to negotiate export business with foreign companies. In just two days, June 4 and 5, the orders for Dabao Special Effect Hair Tonic reached 5 million US dollars. He not only signed a contract with Singapore to export 1.3 million US dollars worth of cosmetics annually but also signed an agreement with Singapore to jointly establish a cosmetics factory and beauty salon.

On the night of June 4, Wu Baoxin called from Hong Kong. The security chief on duty reported the workers' thoughts to him. Wu Baoxin said: "All the workers in the factory must clearly oppose the counter-revolutionary riot and maintain political and ideological consistency with the Party Central Committee." Someone pressed the "speakerphone" button, and the duty room immediately echoed with the factory director's powerful and resolute voice from thousands of miles away. He specially instructed the factory's on-duty leaders: "Protect the factory and the workers, and do not let the disabled workers go to the streets."

The Sanlu Factory, which took off in the 1980s with reform and opening up, passed the comprehensive evaluation of the national second-level enterprise joint evaluation team on June 16 after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Wu Baoxin was deeply moved: "It is the Party Central Committee that formulated the good policy of reform and opening up. Otherwise, how could a welfare factory with half of its workers being blind, deaf, mute, or disabled have today's achievements? As the factory director, I have personally experienced everything that happened in the past four years. Therefore, I am even more convinced: Only socialism can save China!"

Reclaiming the losses caused by the turmoil

Currently, the international and domestic cosmetics markets are highly competitive. Wu Baoxin, as the director of Sanlu Factory with 1,600 workers, is well aware of the heavy burden on his shoulders. On June 5 and 6, he called from Hong Kong to discuss production and reclaiming the losses caused by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot with other factory leaders.

He mobilized all the workers in the factory: "Boost production and earn back the foreign exchange." On June 11, Wu Baoxin called from Zhuhai and arranged for the factory to send condolences to the People's Liberation Army troops that came to Beijing to enforce martial law. The next afternoon, Deputy Director Zhang Shijun and worker representatives went to the Tian Tan Park military camp, presenting a plaque that read "Military and civilians united, together we will revive China," and also sent vegetables, pork, and more than 30 boxes of suitable cosmetics to the troops. A blind person approached a soldier and said, "Thank you for suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and defending our socialist motherland. I can't see your appearance, but please allow me to touch your face and your uniform." The soldier's eyes welled up with tears, and many workers present also had tears in their eyes.

During the turmoil, a young worker named Wu Baorong was asked to leave the factory after a fight with other workers. Feeling bored at home, he said he wanted to go to Tiananmen Square to see the excitement. Wu Baoxin heard about this and talked to him twice, advising him not to go. Wu Baorong said, "I lost my job, and my girlfriend is also going to break up with me. If the director restores my job, I promise not to go to Tiananmen Square."

Wu Baoxin decided to "handle this case specially." He told Wu Baorong, "As long as you promise not to go to Tiananmen Square and not to fight in the future, you can return to work at the factory."

Wu Baorong jumped for joy: "Thank you, Director!"

Later, Wu Baorong indeed did not go to Tiananmen Square and now works very hard.

On the afternoon of September 4, at a meeting of all the cadres in the factory, Wu Baoxin told everyone that the Japanese Ministry of Health's examination of Dabao Special Effect Hair Tonic, which took 3.5 years and cost 6 million US dollars by 8 medical doctors, was about to be completed. This means that their hair tonic may be continuously sold to Japan and other countries around the world. To save time, everyone in the factory should work together, with one hand focusing on the investigation and the other on creating foreign exchange. Not only should we create wealth for the country, but we should also add luster to the country!

Money cannot buy patriotism

This summer, at the cosmetics exhibition held in Hong Kong, the Dabao series of cosmetics from Beijing Sanlu Factory was praised by merchants from various countries. Chinese herbal cosmetics are favored by people in the trend of "returning to nature," and the inventor Wu Baoxin also became a key figure for news reporters to interview.

At the press conference held by the organizers for Beijing Sanlu Factory, a British reporter asked Wu Baoxin, "You have invented so many cosmetics. Have you ever thought of becoming a millionaire abroad?" Wu Baoxin smiled calmly, "Sir, I have never thought about it. I only think about relieving the pain of more bald people."

Of course, that reporter did not understand or could not understand Wu Baoxin's pursuit.

As early as 1983, a Hong Kong businessman learned that Wu Baoxin had invented Zhenzhuo Lu and sent someone to Wu Baoxin's home, offering 200,000 US dollars to buy the formula. Wu Baoxin was very straightforward, using a "no" to answer. The man thought he was asking for more money, and Wu Baoxin said firmly, "Things that can be bought with money in the world are cheap. I want to dedicate my technology and myself to my motherland."

Overseas relatives also successively wrote letters advising him to go abroad. Someone told him that it would not take more than three years to become a millionaire. Wu Baoxin still smiled, "I have endured so many days and nights, spent decades of effort, is it just to exchange for a millionaire? No, no amount of money can buy the patriotism of a Chinese intellectual!"

When talking about Wu Baoxin, from disabled workers to the newly appointed factory party committee secretary Wang Shoushan, everyone said he is an entrepreneur with integrity.

　　一身正气
　　——记北京三露厂厂长武宝信
　　本报记者　赖仁琼
    今年5月中下旬，正当北京的学潮、动乱随着炎热的气候一再升温的时候，北京市三露厂厂长武宝信却在厂庆四周年纪念会和几次厂务会上反复讲：“中国必须走社会主义道路，必须坚持共产党的领导。”并在会上正式宣布：“本厂职工不准停工停产，不准上街游行，不准声援学生”的“三不准”决议。
    在当时说这话，是需要些勇气和胆识的。
    武宝信为何如此旗帜鲜明呢？
      “没有改革开放，哪有今天的三露厂？”
    5月17日，当首都数万群众走上街头游行时，三露厂也有少部分工人要求去天安门广场声援学生。虽然厂长已经宣布了“三不准”，但还是有个别人情绪激动，并有少数盲人职工也想上街。武宝信激动地对大家说：“你们想过吗？没有共产党，没有改革开放，哪有今天的三露厂？没有安定团结的政治局面，又哪有三露厂年年翻番的经济效益？你们应该知道，工人罢工，就会出现停水、停电、断粮等灾难。我诚恳地请求大家坚持坚守岗位，坚持生产。”
    从北京出现学潮、动乱到发生反革命暴乱，武宝信除了在北京，还奔波于涿州、珠海的分厂指挥生产，并赴香港、新加坡组织大宝系列化妆品展销、与外商洽谈出口业务。仅6月4日和5日两天，大宝特效生发灵的订货就达500万美元。他不仅与新加坡签订了每年出口130多万美元化妆品的合同，还签订了与新加坡合资办化妆品厂和美容室的协议书。
    6月4日深夜，武宝信从香港打回长途电话，值班的保卫科长向他汇报了职工的思想动态后，武宝信说：“全厂职工要旗帜鲜明地反对反革命暴乱，从政治上、思想上与党中央保持一致。”有人按下了电话机上的“扩音”键，值班室即刻回荡着数千里外的厂长那宏亮、坚定的声音。他特地嘱咐工厂值班的领导：要保护好工厂，保护好职工，千万不能让残疾职工上街。
    在改革开放的八十年代起步腾飞的三露厂，于北京平息反革命暴乱后的6月16日通过了国家二级企业联合考评组的综合考评，晋升为国家二级企业。对此，武宝信感慨万端：“是党中央制订了改革开放的好政策。否则，一个半数职工为盲、聋、哑残疾人的福利工厂怎能有今天？作为厂长，我亲历了4年中发生的一切，由此，我更加坚信：只有社会主义才能救中国！”
              把动乱造成的损失夺回来
    目前，国际国内化妆品市场竞争十分激烈。武宝信作为三露厂1600名职工的当家人，清楚肩上的担子有多重。6月5日、6日连续两天，他从香港打回电话与其他厂领导谈生产、谈夺回被动乱和反革命暴乱造成的损失。
    他动员全厂职工：“把生产搞上去，把外汇挣回来。”6月11日，武宝信从珠海打回电话，让厂里安排慰问进京执行戒严任务的解放军。第二天下午，副厂长张世俊和职工代表来到天坛公园部队驻地，送上一面锦旗，上书“军民一家，共振中华”，还为部队送去了蔬菜、猪肉数千斤和30多箱适用的化妆品。一个盲人走近解放军战士说：“感谢你们平息反革命暴乱、保卫了社会主义祖国。我看不见你们的形象，请允许我摸摸你的脸庞，摸摸你的军装。”战士的眼睛湿润了，在场的许多职工也热泪盈眶。
    动乱期间，因与职工打架而被劝退在家的青工吴宝荣闲的无聊，说是想去天安门看看热闹。武宝信听说后，两次找他谈话，劝他不要去。吴宝荣说：“工作丢了，女朋友也要跟我吹。如果厂长恢复我的工作，我保证不去天安门。”
    武宝信决定“特事特办”，他对吴宝荣说：“只要你保证不去天安门，并且保证以后不再打架，就可以回厂上班。”
    吴宝荣高兴的直蹦：“谢谢你，厂长！”
    后来，吴宝荣果真没有去天安门，而且现在工作还十分卖力。
    9月4日下午，在全厂干部会上，武宝信告诉大家，日本厚生省对大宝特效生发灵的检验，即由8个医学博士历时3年半，耗资600万美元的十分严格的检验即将结束。这意味着他们的生发灵可能源源不断地销往日本和世界各国。为了赶时间，全厂上下要齐心协力，一手抓清查，一手抓创汇。不仅要为国家创造财富，还要为国家增添光彩！
              金钱难买爱国魂
    今年夏季，在香港举办的化妆品展览会上，北京三露厂的大宝系列化妆品受到各国客商的赞扬。中国植物化妆品在“走向大自然”的潮流中备受人们喜爱，发明者武宝信也成为新闻记者采访的重点人物。
    在主办者为北京三露厂举行的记者招待会上，一位英国记者问武宝信：“你发明了这么多化妆品，有没有想过到国外当一个百万富翁？”武宝信淡然一笑：“先生，我没有想过。我想的只是为更多脱发人解除痛苦。”
    当然，那位记者不了解也不可能理解武宝信的追求。
    早在1983年，一位港商得知武宝信发明了粉刺露，便派人到武宝信家，提出用20万美元买他的配方。武宝信很干脆，用一个“不”字作了回答。那人以为他嫌钱少，武宝信斩钉截铁地说：“世界上能用钱买到的东西都是便宜的。我要把我的技术和我自己都交给我的祖国。”
    国外的亲友也相继写过信劝他出国。有人告诉他，不出3年，准成百万富翁。武宝信还是一笑：“我熬了多少个日日夜夜，花了几十年的心血，难道就是为了换个百万富翁吗？不，多少金钱也买不了一个中国知识分子的爱国之心！”
    谈起武宝信，从残疾人职工到新上任的厂党总支书记王守山都说他是一个一身正气的企业家。
