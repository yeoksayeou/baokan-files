The nation has decided to implement a quota system for cotton distribution starting from this production year.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an on September 9th, a reporter learned from the recently concluded National Cotton Supply Planning Conference that starting from this year's cotton production year, the state will implement a quota system for cotton distribution.

The cotton distribution quota system stipulates that the cotton distribution quota is determined based on the state's minimum needs and must be guaranteed to be completed. If cotton production decreases, the corresponding cotton usage in the province or region will be reduced, but the state's cotton distribution quota cannot be reduced. For cotton that exceeds the contracted purchase, it cannot be underreported, and the state's stipulated profit-sharing ratio cannot be reduced. The cotton import quota includes spinning cotton, civilian cotton, and other cotton uses. Each province and region must guarantee the supply according to the state's cotton usage plan and cannot reduce, not supply, or misappropriate the supply. The system also stipulates that cotton will not be subject to a "dual-track" system, and the excess purchase portion must also strictly follow the state's stipulated price.

　　国家决定从本生产年度开始
　　棉花调出调入实行包干
    据新华社西安9月9日电　（记者姜卯生）记者从刚闭幕的全国棉花计划供应会上获悉，从今年的棉花生产年度起，国家实行棉花调出调入包干。
    棉花调拨包干办法规定，棉花调出包干数是根据国家最低需要确定的，必须保证完成。如棉花减产少收，相应减少本省、区用棉量，不能减少国家调出包干任务；对超合同定购多收的棉花不能瞒报，不能减少国家规定的分成比例。棉花调入包干数，包括纺棉、民用棉和其他用棉，各省、区要按照国家安排的用棉计划保证供应，不得少供、不供或挪用。办法还规定，棉花不搞“双轨制”，超购部分也必须严格执行国家规定的价格。
