Li Ruihuan Meets with Hong Kong Journalists, Says Criticism of Bourgeois Liberalization Does Not Mean Opposition to Reform

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 19 (Reporters Zhu Yunlong, Xu Yipeng)

Today in the afternoon, Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, met with a delegation of senior officials from the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* newspapers at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The delegation was led by Vice President Chen Bojiang of *Wen Wei Po* and Vice Editor-in-Chief Zhao Zelong and Chen Bin of *Ta Kung Pao*.

Li Ruihuan briefed the delegation on the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in June this year and answered some of their questions.

He said, China's policy of reform and opening up will not change. We are now criticizing bourgeois liberalization, but of course, we also oppose stagnation.

He said, the policy towards intellectuals will not change. To deny the status and role of intellectuals is to deny the direction of the four modernizations. The policy of allowing multiple economic components to exist and allowing some people to get rich first will be better adhered to.

Li Ruihuan pointed out that allowing individual economies to develop in rural areas is an important factor in stabilizing people's lives. Of course, overall, China is dominated by public ownership and a planned economy.

He also said, history has proven that not allowing some people to get rich first will result in everyone being poor. Poverty is not socialism.

Li Ruihuan used an analogy, saying that reform and opening up is like flying a kite, not "releasing it." The degree to which it is released depends on the control capability.

He said, reform and opening up is a historical necessity and an inevitable trend that is not subject to human will. Without reform and opening up, China has no hope, and the people will not agree. We are confident about this.

He hopes that journalists from Hong Kong will often come to the mainland to visit.

　　李瑞环会见香港新闻界人士时说
　　批判资产阶级自由化也反对僵化
    新华社北京9月19日电　（记者朱云龙、许忆纯）中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了由《文汇报》副社长陈伯坚、《大公报》副总编辑赵泽隆、陈彬率领的香港《大公报》、《文汇报》负责人访京团。
    李瑞环介绍了今年6月平息反革命暴乱的一些情况，并回答了访京团成员提出的一些问题。
    他说，中国改革开放的方针不会变。我们现在批判资产阶级自由化，当然，我们也反对僵化。
    他说，对知识分子的政策不会变，否认知识分子的地位和作用就否认了四化建设的方向。多种经济成份存在、一部分人先富起来的政策，都会更好地坚持下去。
    李瑞环指出，农村允许个体经济发展是稳定人民生活的一个重要因素。当然，从总体上讲，中国是以公有经济、计划经济为主。
    他还说，历史证明，不允许一部分人先富起来，其结果一定是大家都贫穷。贫穷不是社会主义。
    李瑞环比喻说，改革开放就像放风筝，不是“放生”，放开的程度取决于控制能力。
    他说，改革开放是历史的必然，是不以人的意志为转移的大趋势。不改革开放中国就没有希望，人民也不答应。对此，我们是有信心的。
    他希望香港新闻界人士常来内地参观。
