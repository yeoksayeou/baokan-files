Title: Excerpt from a Letter

	To the Editor:

	In the August 27 issue of "Weekly Digest," there was an excerpt from an article by Mao Shuzheng titled "Severe Punishments for Corrupt Officials," which stated that during the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty, the Governor of Guangzhou, Party Renhong, was executed for "embezzling over a million" according to the law. This does not align with historical facts. According to the "Zizhi Tongjian," after Party Renhong was impeached, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty "demoted Renhong to a commoner and exiled him to Qinzhou." This means that Party Renhong was not "executed," but rather stripped of his official status and made a commoner.

　　来函摘登编辑同志：
    8月27日“每周文摘”版摘登毛书征《严刑峻法治污吏》一文称，唐代贞观年间广州都督党仁弘因“赃百万余”而“依法被诛”。这不符合历史事实。据《资治通鉴》记载，党仁弘被弹劾后，唐太宗“黜仁弘为庶人，徙钦州”。就是说，党仁弘最终并未“被诛”，而是被削职为民了。　读者　纪洞天
