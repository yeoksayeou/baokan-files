    The President's Brew
    Brazilian President Sarney is a writer and poet. He not only loves literature but also often indulges in farming, comparing himself to a "pastoral poet." His anecdote of brewing sugarcane alcohol on his own farm has become a famous tale.

    Sarney's farm is located near the capital, Brasília. In his spare time, he often goes there to plant sugarcane and soybeans.

    One of the byproducts of sugarcane is alcohol. In his farm's cellar, there are always a few bottles of fine wine, which only a few close friends can receive as gifts. Those who have tasted this wine all give it a thumbs up, and some call it "Sarney Wine."

    Sarney named the wine he brewed "São José do Belmonte." The labels on the bottles are made by him in his spare time, then pasted on with tape.

    Now that the wine has gained fame, Sarney has asked someone to help improve the label design and had it printed. The most prominent feature on the label is a caricature of Sarney himself, emphasizing his beard and cheeks. Next to it, a few lines of small text read:
    	"Brewed and bottled by the poet and farmer Sarney at the São José do Belmonte farm."

    总统酿酒
    巴西总统萨尔内是一位作家和诗人，他不仅酷爱文学，而且时常寄情农耕，以“田园诗人”自比，他在自己农场酿制甘蔗酒的轶事已被传为美谈。
    萨尔内的农场位于首都巴西利亚近郊，闲暇时，他经常到那里种植甘蔗和黄豆。
    甘蔗的副产品之一就是美酒，在他的农场酒窖里经常保持着几瓶佳酿，只有少数好友可获得这项馈赠，而饮过这种酒的人都会翘起拇指称赞，有人把它称为“萨尔内酒”。
    萨尔内把自己酿造的酒命名为“圣约瑟·杜·贝里古孟”，酒瓶上的标签也是他在空闲时自己动手制作的，然后用胶带粘贴在瓶子上。
    如今该酒的名气已经打响，萨尔内遂请人帮忙修饰标签图样，并交印刷厂制版承印。标签上最显著的就是萨尔内本人的侧影漫画
  （见下图），该画刻意突出他的胡子和面颊，旁边几行小字写着：
      “由诗人兼农场主萨尔内在圣约瑟·杜·贝里古孟农场酿造并装瓶。”
