The people of Shandong, who have risen to become masters of their own land after the founding of New China, have, under the guidance of the principle of "prevention first," fought for four decades and successively sent away the three "plague gods" that had ravaged the land for centuries: black fever, filariasis, and malaria. These diseases had seriously endangered the health of the people.

This province was the first in the country to achieve the standard of basically eliminating black fever in 1958, filariasis in 1983, and malaria in 1988. Recent follow-up investigations have shown that the prevention and treatment effects are consolidated.

This achievement has caused a strong reaction both domestically and internationally. Since 1979, more than 70 experts and scholars from 22 countries and regions have come to Shandong to conduct inspections, giving high evaluations to Shandong's achievements in preventing and treating these three diseases. Shandong Province was originally a high-incidence area for black fever, filariasis, and malaria. These three diseases had caused many places in Shandong to suffer from economic decline and social chaos.

At the beginning of the founding of the country, the various levels of the Communist Party and the people's government immediately organized the broad masses of the people to carry out disease prevention and treatment work. The state invested a large amount of funds to produce a large number of drugs for the prevention and treatment of these three diseases. From 1969 to 1988 alone, the state provided Shandong with free drugs worth more than 45 million yuan for the prevention and treatment of filariasis and malaria. Many people who were saved from the brink of death always praised the Communist Party and the people's government as their saviors.

　　山东人民送“瘟神”
　  基本消灭黑热病、丝虫病和疟疾
    本报济南9月16日电　本报记者贾建舟、新华社记者刘关权报道：新中国诞生以后，翻身作了主人的山东人民，在“预防为主”的方针指引下，奋战四十载，先后送走了猖獗了几个世纪的黑热病、丝虫病、疟疾这三个严重危害人民健康的“瘟神”。
    这个省分别于1958年、1983年和1988年在全国率先达到了基本消灭黑热病、丝虫病和疟疾的标准，近期跟踪调查表明，防治效果巩固。
    这一成就在国内外引起强烈的反响。1979年以来，已有22个国家和地区的70多位专家学者来山东考察，对山东防治这三种病的成果给予高度评价。山东省原是黑热病、丝虫病和疟疾的高发区。这三种病曾使山东很多地方生产凋敝，民不聊生。
    建国伊始，山东各级党委和人民政府立即组织广大人民群众开展防病治病工作。国家为防治疾病投放了大量资金，生产了大量防治这三种疾病的药物。仅1969年至1988年，国家为山东防治丝虫病和疟疾免费投放的药物价值就达4500多万元，很多从死亡线上起死回生的病人谈起这些，总是赞扬共产党和人民政府是他们的救命恩人。
