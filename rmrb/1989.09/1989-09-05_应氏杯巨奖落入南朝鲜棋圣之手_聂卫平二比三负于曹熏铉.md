The Application Cup Grand Prize Falls into the Hands of the South Korean Chess Master
Nie Weiping Loses 2-3 to Cho Hunhyun

	NEWSPAPER REPORT FROM SINGAPORE, SEPTEMBER 5 - The aggressive South Korean chess master Cho Hunhyun today, in the fifth and final match of the first Application Cup World Professional Go Championship, defeated the Chinese chess master Nie Weiping in a mid-game victory, securing the championship title and a $400,000 prize.

	Nie Weiping, a 9-dan player, made a fatal mistake in the mid-game, misjudging a move, which allowed Cho Hunhyun to seize the opportunity on the 145th move, securing the victory. This was the earliest conclusion in the five-match series between the two. The match began at 10 AM and ended at 3:28 PM.

	Both players moved quickly in the first 30 moves, taking only 30 minutes, indicating thorough preparation. Cho Hunhyun aggressively secured territory in four corners while placing two stones in the central area. Nie Weiping cleverly used external influence to hinder his opponent, pushing the white stones towards the center. Cho Hunhyun did not follow, instead focusing on strengthening his central position, intensifying the battle.

	After lunch, both players resumed the match. Cho Hunhyun played tenaciously and steadily, with a clear strategy. Perhaps due to fatigue, Nie Weiping made a mistake on the 118th move and then another due to a misjudgment, losing about 30 points and ultimately losing the game.

	The door with the sign "No Admittance" opened, and Cho Hunhyun leaned back on the sofa, beaming with joy. Nie Weiping sat upright, his eyes fixed on the board, seemingly still unable to believe the outcome.

	After the match, Cho Hunhyun said, "To defeat a strong opponent like Nie Weiping in the mid-game, I am very happy. I didn't expect him to make a mistake."

    应氏杯巨奖落入南朝鲜棋圣之手
    聂卫平二比三负于曹熏铉
    本报新加坡9月5日电　擅长攻击的南朝鲜棋圣曹熏铉今天在首届应氏杯世界职业围棋锦标赛第五局决战中，执黑中盘战胜中国棋圣聂卫平，夺得冠军头衔与40万美金。
    聂卫平九段在中盘阶段一时眼花看错棋，走出致命的一步，被曹熏铉在第145手乘虚而入，奠定胜局。这是双方在应氏杯五局决战中最早结束的一局棋。棋赛于上午10时开始，下午3时28分便告结束。
    双方在前30手落子很快，只花了30分钟，显示彼此都作了充分准备。曹熏铉在四个角拚命抢占实地，同时在中间腹地布下两子。聂卫平则巧妙利用外势阻挠对手，并将白棋推向中腹，曹熏铉并不跟进，只顾加强中腹力量，使战局趋向白热化。
    午餐时间到，双方在第58手后封棋，曹熏铉用时90分钟，聂卫平仅花了30分钟。
    补充精力后再战，曹熏铉下得很顽强，步步扎实，棋路清楚。也许是疲劳造成精神不集中，聂卫平在第118手走错，后来又因眼花而下错棋，一下子损失30余目，就此败下阵来。
    “闲人止步”的房门打开了，曹熏铉靠在沙发上，满脸喜色。聂卫平挺直腰背，双眼紧盯着棋盘，似乎还不相信眼前的结局。
    曹熏铉赛后说：“能够在中盘击败像聂卫平这么强的对手，我非常高兴，我想不到他会下错棋。”
