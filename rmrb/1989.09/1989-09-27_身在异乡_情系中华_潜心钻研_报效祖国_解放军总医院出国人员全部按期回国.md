People's Daily, Beijing, September 26th. Reporter Lai Renqiong reports: This afternoon, the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army held a report meeting for its personnel who had studied abroad. The 17 medical staff who returned to China on schedule after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing emotionally declared, "Our cause is in China!"

Since the reform and opening up, the hospital has sent hundreds of people to study and train in the United States, Japan, France, Italy, West Germany, and other countries. They, with a strong sense of responsibility for the development of China's medical science, studied diligently and achieved fruitful results. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, there were still 40 people from the hospital studying abroad. These medical staff, though abroad, had their hearts with China, closely following the fate of their motherland. They did not believe the rumors and slanders spread by Western media, firmly believed in the correctness of the Party Central Committee's decisions, and showed a high level of political awareness and strict organizational discipline. They consciously resisted the temptation of Western material conditions, resolutely rejected high-paying job offers and visa extensions from abroad, and all returned to their motherland on schedule.

    身在异乡　情系中华　潜心钻研　报效祖国
    解放军总医院出国人员全部按期回国
    本报北京9月26日讯　记者赖仁琼报道：今天下午，解放军总医院举行出国人员汇报会。17名于北京平息反革命暴乱后按期回国的医护人员激动地说，我们的事业在中国！
    改革开放以来，总医院曾派出数百人分赴美国、日本、法国、意大利、联邦德国等国学习、进修。他们怀着发展祖国医学事业的强烈责任感刻苦学习，取得了丰硕的学习成果。北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，医院尚有40多人在国外学习。在外学习的医护人员身在异国，情系中华，时刻关注祖国的命运，不听信西方传播媒介的谣言和诽谤，坚信党中央决策的英明正确，立场坚定，表现出高度的政治觉悟和严格的组织纪律观念。他们自觉抵制西方物质条件的诱惑，断然拒绝了国外的高薪聘用和办理签证延期手续，全部按期返回祖国。
