Burkina Faso is a small country located in the interior of West Africa. Its natural conditions are extremely poor, with a dry season lasting over eight months each year with barely any rain. Additionally, it lacks energy resources and industrial raw materials, so it has long been one of the poorest countries in Africa.

However, in recent years, Burkina Faso's economy has shown encouraging signs, achieving a rare economic growth rate in sub-Saharan Africa that exceeds population growth. The government builds urban residential housing every year, improves rural medical and health care facilities, and enhances basic education. Basic daily necessities, as well as vegetables, fruits, and meats, are abundantly supplied in the market; social order is stable. In the capital Ouagadougou and the economic city of Bobo-Dioulasso, construction sites are everywhere, indicating ongoing development.

Burkina Faso's economic achievements are remarkable. For a long time, the hardworking people of Burkina Faso have been striving to develop their national economy. In recent years, they have expanded cotton cultivation areas and comprehensively improved cotton farming techniques. From 1983 to 1988, cotton exports increased by over 130%, reaching 64,000 tons in 1988. Meanwhile, one-third of the country has established gold mining points, and gold production has increased by more than three times in six years, reaching over 3 tons in 1988. Cotton and gold have become the two pillars of the national economy.

The government's integrity and serious, pragmatic spirit are another important factor in Burkina Faso's healthy and stable economic development.

Since the "August 4 Revolution" in 1983, no minister in Burkina Faso has been involved in business, and there have been no scandals of corruption or bribery in the government.

Foreign aid and loans are all used for economic development. Although there are economic crimes among local officials and society, the government takes strict measures to combat them.

Government officials are very frugal. Ministers all commute in Volkswagen Beetles donated by West Germany. The government has more than ten Mercedes-Benz vehicles, but they are only used for receiving state guests. Ministers do not use official cars for personal visits during holidays and do not install radios or air conditioning in their cars. The government takes a serious and pragmatic attitude towards national economic development plans, strictly arranging investment plans according to the country's financial capabilities.

    民勤政廉的布基纳法索
    青禾
    布基纳法索是地处西非内陆的一个小国。自然条件十分差，全年滴雨难见的旱季长达8个多月；再加上缺乏能源和工业原料，所以长期来属非洲最穷国之列。
    可是近年来，布基纳法索的经济却出现了可喜现象，实现了在撒哈拉以南非洲少见的经济增长高于人口增长。政府每年都在兴建城市居民住宅，完善农村医疗卫生和基础教育设施。市场上基本日用品，以及蔬菜、水果、肉类等供应充足；社会秩序安定。在首都瓦加杜古和经济城市博博市，更是到处可见正在紧张施工的建设工地。
    布基纳法索取得这样的经济成绩是不平常的。长期以来，勤劳的布基纳法索人民努力发展民族经济。近年来，他们扩大棉花种植面积，全面改进棉花耕作技术，从1983年到1988年的六年间棉花出口增长了130％以上，1988年出口棉花6.4万吨。同时，全国1／3的地区建立起了淘金点，在六年内黄金产量增长三倍多，1988年生产黄金3吨多。棉花和黄金成了国家经济的两大支柱。
    政府的廉洁奉公和严肃务实精神，是布基纳法索经济健康平稳发展的另一重要因素。
    布基纳法索在1983年
  “八·四”革命以后的历届政府中都没有部长经商的现象，也未爆发过贪污受贿一类官场丑闻。
    外国援助和贷款都能用于经济发展。地方官员和社会上虽然有经济犯罪行为，但政府对此采取严厉的打击措施。
    政府官员十分节俭。部长们上下班都坐西德赠送的
  “大众”牌小型轿车。政府备有十多辆“奔驰”车，但只供接待国宾用。部长们在节假日私人走亲访友一律不动用公务车，且车上都不安装收录机和空调设备。政府对国家的经济发展计划持严肃和务实的态度，严格根据国家的财政力量安排投资计划。
