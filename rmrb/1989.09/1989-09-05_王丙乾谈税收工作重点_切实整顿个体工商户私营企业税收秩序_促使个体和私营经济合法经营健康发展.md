Wang Binggan, State Councilor and Minister of Finance, emphasized today at the National Taxation Work Conference that rectifying the tax order for individual and private enterprises is not about discouraging the development of individual and private economies or increasing their tax burden. Instead, it is about legally collecting taxes that should have been paid, better implementing the Party and government's policies on developing individual and private economies, and ensuring their lawful and healthy development.

Wang Binggan stated that many individual and private enterprises have amassed wealth through illegal operations and tax evasion, exacerbating social inequities in distribution. This has become a serious political issue, and the public has strong opinions about it. The State Council's decision to rectify the tax order in this area is necessary. All levels of taxation authorities should consider this a key task and achieve tangible results.

Wang Binggan pointed out that it is essential to continue improving the clearance and rectification of tax exemptions and reductions. The practice of ignoring tax laws and industry policies, granting exemptions and reductions based on profitability, and using tax exemptions to fund construction projects and create new investment channels must be corrected. Exemptions and reductions for various types of companies should be canceled, and the blind expansion of companies should be restricted.

The National Taxation Work Conference concluded today in Beijing.

    王丙乾谈税收工作重点
    切实整顿个体工商户私营企业税收秩序
    促使个体和私营经济合法经营健康发展
    本报北京9月5日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾今天在全国税务工作会议上重申，整顿个体工商户和私营企业税收秩序，决不是不要发展个体和私营经济，也不是加重他们的税收负担，而是要依法把他们应纳未纳的税款收上来，更好地执行党和政府关于发展个体经济、私营经济的政策，促使其合法经营，健康地发展。
    王丙乾说，个体工商户和私营企业中，确有不少是靠非法经营和偷税漏税，牟取暴利而“暴富”的，加剧了社会成员之间分配不公，已经成为一个严肃的政治问题，人民群众对此意见很大。现在，国务院决定对这方面的税收秩序进行整顿，是十分必要的。各级税务机关应把它作为工作重点，切实抓出成效。
    王丙乾指出，必须继续搞好清理整顿减免税工作。要坚决纠正那种不顾税法，不符合产业政策要求，认为有效益就可减免的变相“包税”的做法，防止通过减免税去搞基本建设，形成新的投资渠道。要取消对各类公司的减免税优惠，限制公司的盲目发展。
    全国税务工作会议于今日在京结束。
