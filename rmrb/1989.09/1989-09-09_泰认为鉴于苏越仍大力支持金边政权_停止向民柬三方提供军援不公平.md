Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 8th.

Thailand’s Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department said at a press conference today that calling for foreign countries to stop providing military aid to the United Front of Democratic Kampuchea while not calling for the Soviet Union and Vietnam to stop providing military aid to the Heng Samrin regime is unfair.

The spokesperson made these remarks in response to Vietnam and the Heng Samrin regime's call, following the recent Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue, for foreign countries to stop providing military aid to the three factions of the Democratic Kampuchea. He said, "The government of Cambodia should come from the people, not be a government established by another country with guns, and it is even more unreasonable to call for not allowing others to support the oppressed."

He said, "Over the past 11 years, Vietnam and the Soviet Union have provided an incalculable amount of military aid to the Heng Samrin regime." From May to July this year, the Soviet Union alone provided 12 shipments of weapons and ammunition to the Heng Samrin regime, estimated to be no less than 14,000 tons. He said, "The amount of military aid provided by foreign countries to the United Front of Democratic Kampuchea, which is recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Cambodia, is not comparable to the amount of military aid received by the illegal Heng Samrin regime." He predicted that the Soviet Union and Vietnam would continue to provide military aid to the Heng Samrin regime during the period before Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia.

### 泰认为鉴于苏越仍大力支持金边政权  停止向民柬三方提供军援不公平

    泰认为鉴于苏越仍大力支持金边政权
    停止向民柬三方提供军援不公平
    新华社曼谷9月8日电　泰国外交部副发言人今天在这里举行的记者招待会上说，呼吁外国停止向民主柬埔寨联合政府提供军事援助，而又不呼吁苏联和越南停止向韩桑林政权提供军援是不公平的。
    这位发言人是在提到越南和韩桑林政权在刚刚结束的关于柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议之后呼吁外国停止向民柬三方提供军事援助时这样说的。他说，柬埔寨“政府应该来自人民，而不是由另一个国家用枪杆子建立起来的政府，况且还呼吁不让别人支持被欺侮者”更是没有道理的。他说，“在过去的11年中，越南和苏联尽力向韩桑林政权提供了多到难以计算价值的军事援助。”今年5月至7月，苏联共向韩桑林政权提供了12船的武器弹药，估计不少于14000吨。他说，外国向得到联合国承认的柬埔寨合法政府——民主柬埔寨联合政府三方提供军事援助在数量上是不能同非法的韩桑林政权得到的军事援助相比的。他预计苏联和越南将利用越南从柬埔寨撤军之前的时间继续向韩桑林政权提供军事援助。
