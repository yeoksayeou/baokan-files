	Wars are one of the greatest disasters that humans have inflicted upon themselves. According to statistics from a Swedish scholar, by the 1970s, in the 5,560 years of recorded history, there had been a total of 14,531 wars, large and small. There were only 329 years of peace. In these wars, 3.64 billion people lost their lives, and the financial losses, if converted into gold, could form a belt 150 kilometers wide, 10 meters thick, and encircling the Earth.

	In 1983, a professor from Hungary calculated that in the 37 years following the Second World War, there had been 470 local wars worldwide, resulting in the deaths of approximately 10 million people. There were only 26 days without any wars.

    历史上曾发生过多少次战争
    战争是人类给自己制造的最大灾难之一。据瑞典学者统计，至本世纪七十年代，在有历史记载的五千五百六十年中，共发生过大小战争一万四千五百三十一次，其间只有三百二十九年是和平的。在这些战争中丧生的人达三十六点四亿，而损失的财富，若折合成黄金，可制成一条宽一百五十公里、厚十米、环绕地球一周的金带。
    匈牙利有位教授于一九八三年统计：在第二次世界大战后的三十七年中，世界爆发局部战争四百七十余起，大约有一千万人死于战火，无任何战争的日子只有二十六天。
