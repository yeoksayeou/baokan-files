When I stood on the streets of Mexico City, I saw that on the one-way roads, four or five cars were moving forward in parallel, their colorful bodies shimmering under the sunlight, dazzling the eyes.

Cars seem to be the main mode of transportation in Mexico City. It was not until I visited the underground subway that I realized Mexico City's subway system is also very advanced and is a daily transportation tool for ordinary citizens.

Mexico City's subway has a 20-year history.

It currently has 8 underground subway lines, totaling 141.5 kilometers, all of which are double tracks, with 121 stations. The subway lines crisscross the city, reaching every corner of Mexico City.

The subway here is 33 meters below the ground. Most of the lines are underground, but some also extend above ground. The subway stations are spacious, with bright lights, food stalls, and well-lit shops with fine merchandise. There is an exhibition titled "Journey to the Stars" with large photographs, real objects, and television displays. People bustle about, making it seem like an underground shopping mall.

The subway entrances have six unmanned entrances in the middle. Each entrance has an automatic ticket gate.

The entire vehicle operation is programmed, with everything controlled by computers for speed and stopping. The driver only needs to open and close the doors. After passengers enter the car, the driver presses a button to close the doors, then gently lifts a metal ring, and the vehicle moves forward, automatically controlling the speed.

The subway cars in Mexico have clean windows and seats. Passengers often give up their seats for others, and women rarely stand.

Passengers can automatically select routes to reach their destinations without leaving the station. The subway handles approximately 5 million passengers per day, managed by the city government, and is also a public welfare measure.

Each subway ticket costs 100 pesos (approximately 1.5 fen in Chinese currency), while the various operating costs are about 300 pesos, with the government providing subsidies.

    墨西哥城的地铁
    薛奕明
    当我站立在墨西哥城的街头，只见单行线的马路上，并列四、五辆汽车梭梭向前，各种颜色的车身在阳光照耀下闪烁得人眼花缭乱。
    汽车似乎是墨西哥城的主要交通工具。直到我参观了地下铁，才知道墨西哥城的地下铁路也很先进，是普通市民日常依靠的交通工具。
    墨西哥城地铁有20年历史。
    它现有8条地下铁路线，全长141.5公里，都是双线，共有121个车站。地下铁路线纵横交错地伸向墨西哥城各个角落。
    这里的地铁离地面是33米，绝大多数线路都在地下，但有的也伸出地面。地铁站宽敞，灯光闪耀，有出售食品的小摊，也有橱窗明亮、物品精美的商店，有一处正在举行一个“走向星际”的展览，有巨幅照片，有实物，有电视显象。人们熙熙攘攘，好像一个地下商场。
    地铁入口中间一排6个入口处，无人管理。每个进口处都设有自动检票机。
    整个车辆驾驶都已程序化，一切都通过电子计算机控制速度及停车。驾驶员只管开门、关门。乘客进车厢后，司机则按钮关闭车门，然后轻轻提起一金属圆环，车辆就前进，自动控速。
    墨西哥的地铁车厢车窗净亮，座位清洁，乘客间相互让座，妇女很少站立。
    乘客只要不出站，可以自动选调线路到达自己目的地。地铁每天流量约为500万人次，由市政府管理，也是一项市民福利措施。
    每张地铁票价为100比索（约合人民币一角五分）而各种开支成本约为300比索，由政府补贴。
