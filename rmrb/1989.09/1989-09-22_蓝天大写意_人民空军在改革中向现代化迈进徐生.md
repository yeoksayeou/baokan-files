The People's Air Force, with its fleet of nearly 100 aircraft of various types, conducted a large-scale exercise, showcasing the might and prowess of the Chinese Air Force. Fighter jets equipped with air-to-air missiles patrolled the skies at altitudes of over 10,000 meters; formidable bomber and ground-attack aircraft struck "enemy" tank formations with a barrage of cannon fire, bombs, and cluster rockets; mine-laying aircraft laid dense anti-tank minefields in "enemy" infiltration zones; electronic warfare aircraft engaged in electronic combat with the "enemy" using powerful electromagnetic waves.

This display of the People's Air Force's capabilities marked a significant contrast to the early days of the People's Republic of China. During the founding ceremony of the new nation, Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De reviewed a mere 17 propeller-driven aircraft, captured from the enemy, at Tiananmen Square. Forty years later, the People's Air Force has grown into a formidable force, comprising aviation units, anti-aircraft artillery, surface-to-air missiles, airborne troops, and support units such as radar and communications, vigilantly defending the skies of the motherland.

To align with the strategic shift in the military's development, the Air Force is committed to the goal of "facing the world, facing the future, and facing modernization." It is exploring paths to greater strength through reform.

In terms of training systems, the Air Force has initially streamlined the training process from the recruitment of pilots to operational units, integrating pilot recruitment into the national college entrance examination system to elevate the scientific and cultural standards of pilots. The training procedures for pilots have been reformed, implementing a three-tier training system consisting of flight academies, conversion training bases, and operational units, thereby reducing the number of training units within operational units and enhancing overall combat effectiveness.

In terms of training content, flight academies have raised the standards and levels of training, ensuring that pilots receive higher education both in units and academies, fundamentally improving the knowledge and cultural structure of the pilot corps. Operational units have gradually broken away from old training models, adopting a synchronized training approach that integrates command, flight, and support, thereby ensuring the overall improvement of the Air Force's combat effectiveness.

In terms of training methods, the Air Force has initially popularized electronic teaching, established numerous training facilities, and widely applied training simulators. In 1986, the Air Force successfully organized a laser and electronic simulation tactical confrontation exercise. This exercise was not constrained by any weather conditions and simulated combat scenarios that could not be practiced with live ammunition, demonstrating a necessary path for the development of modern military training.

In terms of training management, they have gradually introduced modern scientific management principles into the training domain, injecting vitality and dynamism into training.

Currently, the construction of the Air Force has reached its historical best, with commanders from the Air Force Commander to the aviation unit commanders, division commanders, and regiment commanders all capable of flying. The airborne troops' military leaders at all levels are proficient in parachuting.

With the ambition to reach the heavens and grasp the sun and moon, the streamlined People's Air Force is soaring towards the goal of having a lean organization, agile command, advanced equipment, proficient training, swift response, and higher efficiency.

    蓝天大写意
    ——人民空军在改革中向现代化迈进
    徐生
    祖国的万里蓝天，战鹰划空而过。装备着空对空导弹的歼击机群，巡逻在万米高空；威武的轰炸机群和强击机群，以骤雨般的航炮航弹和集束火箭，对“敌”集群坦克实施突击；布雷飞机在“敌”入侵地段布下了密集的反坦克雷带；电子干扰飞机以强大的电磁波与“敌”展开电子对抗战。
    这是人民空军的近百架各型飞机进行的一次大规模演练，显示出中国空军的威武雄姿。
    40年前，新中国开国大典时，毛泽东主席和周恩来总理、朱德总司令等在天安门城楼阅兵，空军只有17架从敌人手中缴获的螺旋桨飞机接受检阅。40年后的今天，人民空军已经发展成为一支以航空兵部队为主体，包括高炮、地空导弹、空降兵等作战部队，以及雷达、通信等保障部队合成的军种，警惕地保卫着祖国的领空。
    为适应我军建设指导思想的战略性转变，空军正以“面向世界，面向未来，面向现代化”为目标，坚持在改革中探索着更加强大之道。
    在训练体制上，空军初步理顺了从飞行人员招收到作战部队全过程的训练路子，将招收飞行人员的工作纳入了国家统一高考序列，提高了飞行人员的科学文化起点；改革了飞行人员培训程序，实行了“飞行院校——改装训练基地——作战部队”3级训练体制，使作战部队减少了训练团，从整体布局上增强了战斗力。
    在训练内容上，飞行院校提高了培训规格和层次，使飞行人员在部队、院校接受了高等教育，从根本上改善了飞行员队伍的知识文化结构。作战部队逐步突破了旧的训练模式，实行了指挥、飞行与保障同步配套训练，从而保证了空军整体战斗力的提高。
    在训练手段上，空军初步普及了电化教学，兴建了大批教学场所，训练模拟器材也得到普及应用。1986年，空军成功地组织了一次激光、电子模拟战术对抗演习。这次演习不受任何天候条件限制，模拟演练了真枪实弹无法演练的战斗课目，展示了一条现代化军队训练发展的必由之路。
    在训练管理上，他们逐步把现代科学管理的原理引入到训练领域，增加了训练的生机与活力。
    现在，空军部队的建设，已恢复和达到了历史最好时期的水平，从司令员到航空兵部队的军长、师长、团长都会飞行，空降兵部队的各级军事主官都会跳伞。
    志在九天揽日月。经过精简整编后的人民空军，正朝着机构精干、指挥灵便、装备精良、训练有素、反应敏捷、效率更高的目标翱翔。
