Recently, the sale of lottery tickets for the Asian Games has been very popular in Beijing. Upon inquiry, it was found that these beautifully made lottery tickets are products of a Taiwanese-invested enterprise – Beijing Leda Industry Company. With the introduction of the Beijing Taiwan Compatriots Investment and Trade Consulting Service Company, we specially visited this first fully Taiwanese-owned enterprise in Beijing.

**Throwing a Stone to Test the Water**

Taiwanese compatriot Ms. Xie Xiaohong is the chairperson of the company. She was in the United States on urgent business. Her husband, Mr. Liu Guosheng, the general manager of Leda Company, introduced the company's establishment process to us.

Mr. Liu, who is in his early 50s, is straightforward. As entrepreneurs, they have rich experience in setting up factories in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, the United States, and other places. They have long considered investing in the mainland, but they were hesitant about the risks of setting up a private enterprise in a socialist country.

In July 1988, the State Council issued the "Regulations on Encouraging Taiwan Compatriots to Invest," which prompted Mr. Liu and his wife to decide: no matter how things change, the heart of China remains the same. They decided to invest $500,000 to set up a small, fully-owned enterprise to test the waters.

Their initial plan was to establish a medium-sized restaurant, but due to various reasons, this did not materialize. Fortunately, the Ministry of Civil Affairs was planning to issue welfare lottery tickets, which at that time was the only user of lottery tickets in the country, and there were no factories producing them. Mr. Liu and his wife promptly contacted and gained the support of the China Welfare Lottery Ticket Issuing Center.

Mr. Liu said, "We hope for a fair competitive market environment. To this end, we proposed the policy of 'bearing risks and profits independently,' which was approved by the buyer."

**Unexpected Smoothness**

While abroad, Mr. Liu and his wife had heard many stories about the difficulties of doing business in the mainland. However, from the drafting of the feasibility study report, the company's articles of association, submission to relevant departments for approval, to the completion of a series of procedures, it took only two months.

Importing machinery and equipment required permits, and transporting by train or plane required coordination, and upon arrival in Beijing, customs procedures had to be handled... They thought there would be many delays, but it turned out to be unexpectedly smooth. Mr. Liu said with satisfaction, "From our experience, the efficiency of the relevant departments is not inferior to that of any similar departments abroad!"

Mr. Liu summarized: The reason why Leda was established relatively smoothly is mainly due to two experiences: First, we found the right door. The Taiwan Compatriots Investment Company we found has good service, high efficiency, and reasonable fees, which is highly recommended to Taiwanese investors. Second, we adhere to laws and regulations and handle matters according to the rules. In the past, when setting up factories overseas, we often had to take the route of 'bribery' and 'connections,' but this time in Beijing, we insisted on handling matters according to laws and regulations and firmly refused to 'bribe.' In fact, no one asked us to 'bribe.'

**Grand Opening**

Leda Company officially started production on March 2 this year. In just a few months, it reached a monthly production capacity of 30 million "tear-open instant lottery tickets" and undertook the production task of the Asian Games lottery tickets. As the general manager, Mr. Liu is very satisfied with the company's situation. "What impressed us was the quality of Beijing's workers. Some overseas rumors say that mainland workers are lazy, but I think the opposite is true. My impression is that they have a high cultural level, are willing to use their brains, follow discipline, and once their enthusiasm is released, it will produce extremely high work efficiency."

The key lies in good management methods and a reasonable wage system. Mr. Liu told us that strict institutional management actually has a "simplifying" function, and everyone is measured by the same standard. So far, several workers have been dismissed by the company, including a factory director.

Just as Leda's production was on track, the Beijing incident broke out. Leda was not affected at all. On the contrary, the satisfactory results encouraged Mr. Liu and his wife to invest $300,000 to add a production line and another $750,000 to build a new lottery ticket production line.

Leda is full of confidence in the future. (Accompanying photo: Mr. Liu Guosheng at "Leda").

　　“乐达利”办厂之路
　　——访北京第一家台胞独资企业
　　本报记者　郑固固　王连伟
    这一阵北京市面上亚运会奖券发售得很红火。一打听，这些制作精美的奖券原是一家台资企业——北京乐达利实业公司的产品。在北京台湾同胞投资贸易咨询服务公司万有印代总经理的引荐下，我们专程拜访了这个北京第一家台胞独资企业。
                    投石问路
    台胞谢晓虹女士是公司的董事长，她因紧急商务去了美国。她的丈夫、乐达利公司的总经理刘国生先生向我们介绍了公司成立的经过。
    今年50露头的刘先生快人快语。作为企业家，他们有在东南亚、香港、美国等地办厂的丰富经验，对到大陆投资“早有此心”，但是到实行社会主义的地方办私人企业，是否“风险太大？”对此他们一度顾虑重重，下不了决心。
    1988年7月，国务院公布了《关于鼓励台湾同胞投资的规定》，刘国生夫妇盘算：千变万变，变不了一颗中国心。他们决定投资50万美元，办个独资小企业，投石问路做个试验。
    他们投资初衷是搞一家中小型的饭店，但由于种种原因没有搞成。恰逢民政部要搞社会福利有奖募捐券，这在当时是国内唯一的奖券用户，也没有哪家工厂生产，刘国生夫妇毅然同民政部中国社会福利有奖募捐券发行中心联系并取得了支持。
    刘先生说：“我们希望有一个公平竞争的市场环境。为此，提出了‘自担风险，自负盈亏’的方针，得到买方的赞许。”
                      意外顺利
    在国外时，刘国生夫妇听到过很多关于国内办事难的传闻。但他们从拟可行性研究报告，起草公司章程，送交有关部门审批到一系列手续办妥，仅仅用了两个月的时间。
    机器设备进口要办批文，火车飞机发运要打交道，运抵北京还要办海关手续……本以为会有不少耽搁，不想又是出乎意料之外的顺利。刘先生满意地说，从我们的感受看，各有关部门办事效率之高，绝不亚于任何国外的同类部门！
    刘先生总结说：乐达利之所以办得比较顺利，主要有两条经验：第一是找对了门。我们找的台胞投资公司，服务好，效率高，收费合理，很值得向台胞投资者推荐。第二是遵纪守法，照章办事。过去在海外办厂，也常要走“上贡”、“托人情”的路子，而这次在北京，我们坚持照章依法办事，坚决不“上贡”，事情反而较快办完了。事实上也没有人要我们“上贡”。
                      开业大吉
    乐达利公司今年3月2日如期正式开工，短短的几个月就达到月产3000万张“撕开式即开型奖券”的水平，并承接了亚运会奖券的生产任务。作为总经理的刘先生对企业的状况很满意。“令我们印象深刻之处，在于北京工人的素质。国外有些传闻说大陆工人如何懒，我看其实正相反。给我的感觉是，他们文化水平高，肯动脑筋，肯守纪律，积极性一旦发挥出来就会产生极高的工作效率。”
    关键在于良好的管理方法和合理的工资制度。刘先生告诉我们，靠严格的制度管理实际有一种“简化”功能，所有的人都是一把尺子，工作劣优就有了唯一的标准。到目前为止已有数名工人被企业除名，包括一名厂长。
    乐达利生产走上轨道之机，恰逢北京风波兴起之时。乐达利丝毫没受影响，相反，令人满意的成绩促使刘先生夫妇投入30万美元增加一条生产线，又投入75万美元兴建一条新奖券生产线。
    乐达利对前景充满信心。（附图片）
