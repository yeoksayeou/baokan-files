Since last year, our county has seen a continuous occurrence of illegal land occupation for housing construction, with a significant portion of the offenders being district, township, and village cadres. Although relevant departments have taken action, the problem of illegal land occupation persists. From January to May this year, the county reported 2,540 cases of illegal land occupation for housing construction.

Why does the trend of illegal land occupation for housing construction continue to worsen? From our county's situation, the main reason is that some townships do not handle those who illegally occupy land for housing construction decisively. They do not demolish what should be demolished or confiscate what should be confiscated, but merely impose fines. As a result, the phenomenon of "fined in the front, illegally occupied in the back, annual cleanup, annual incompletion, as long as the house is not demolished, fines are acceptable" has emerged. In the process of land occupation for housing construction, some people even abuse their power, misappropriate public funds, and occupy labor, transportation, and building materials without compensation or at low cost. Some even use the constructed houses for commercial purposes or rent them out, seeking to make huge profits. This has caused significant public discontent.

We appeal to all levels of government and land management departments to be bold and impartial in enforcing the law in the cleanup of illegal land occupation. Do not be lenient, do not make concessions, and do not protect anyone. For those who illegally occupy land and misuse land for private housing, they must be resolutely dealt with according to the law: those who should be dismissed should be dismissed, and those who should be prosecuted should be prosecuted. Violations of which laws should be punished according to which laws, and do not just use fines to replace party discipline, administrative discipline, and national laws. Do not do things that are "not to be repeated in the future."

### 前头罚了款　后头又滥占　年年搞清理　年年清不完　合川县查处违法建房不力

　　前头罚了款　后头又滥占　年年搞清理　年年清不完
　　合川县查处违法建房不力
    去年以来，我县违法占地建房案件不断发生，违法占地者相当一部分是区、乡、村干部。虽然有关部门分别作了处理，但违法占地的现象仍有禁不止。今年1月至5月，全县就发生违法占地建房案件2540件。
    乱占土地建房之风何以愈演愈烈？从我县的情况来看，主要原因是一些乡镇对那些违法占地建房者处理不坚决，该拆的不拆、该没收的不没收，仅以罚款了事。于是，出现了“前头罚了款，后头又滥占，年年搞清理，年年清不完，只要不拆房，罚款也情愿”的现象。在占地建房中，有的人还利用职权，挪用公款，无偿或廉价占用劳力、运输工具和建筑材料，有的甚至将所建的房屋用作经商、出租，从中谋取暴利。对此，群众意见很大。
    呼吁各级政府及土地管理部门，在清理违法占地工作中，要敢于秉公执法，不手软、不迁就、不包庇；对违法占地、滥用土地建私房的，要坚决依法查处：该撤职的要撤职，该法办的要法办，触犯了哪条法律就按哪条法律处罚，不要仅仅用罚款代替党纪、政纪、国法处理，不要搞“下不为例”的事了。
