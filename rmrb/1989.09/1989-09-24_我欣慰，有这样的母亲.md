In December 1987, my son Dong Heng suddenly contracted a rare disease known as Weber-Christian disease, which had only been identified in two cases in China. The merciless disease left him severely swollen all over, his facial features distorted beyond recognition, his digestive system inflamed, and he lost control of his bowel movements...

In despair, we sent Dong Heng from Inner Mongolia to Beijing, where he was exceptionally admitted to the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army. The respected medical staff sacrificed their precious time with family during the Spring Festival to provide first-class care. After more than 200 days of desperate rescue efforts, a total of 13,600 milliliters of fresh blood and a large amount of human albumin and other high-nutrition drugs were administered to Dong Heng, successfully pulling him back from the brink of death. He was then transferred to a rehabilitation bed for further treatment. When his condition relapsed during the Spring Festival of 1989, he was transferred to the General Hospital of the Nanjing Military Region for emergency treatment. After more than 80 days of meticulous care, the child safely returned to Inner Mongolia. Now, he is undergoing rehabilitation treatment and can take care of himself, preparing to return to school next year.

What brought Dong Heng back to life was not just the doctors' superb medical skills. I will never forget that when I had almost sold all my family's assets to save my child and could not come up with the necessary deposit for the hospital, the director of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Liang Guozhang, said to me, "We will follow the old rules of the Communist Party and save the person first!" He promptly admitted my critically ill child. They invited domestic and foreign experts and professors three times. Among them were Chen Yuanfang, a professor of the digestive system at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Zhang Baichuan, vice president of the Navy General Hospital, Li Leishi, vice president of the Nanjing Military Region General Hospital, and professors Mou Shancheng and Cai Xinghua from their own hospital, for meticulous consultations. When Dong Heng was transferred to Nanjing, Li Leishi also organized expert consultations three times. All of this was for the sake of one child!

What brought Dong Heng back to life was not just the medical workers. The trade union and youth league of the Hohhot Railway Bureau launched a fundraising campaign among all employees, young pioneers, and youth across the bureau to save Dong Heng. In just a few days, from the depths of the desert on the Baolan Line to the international railway trunk line Jitong Line, people sent batches of donations and letters of encouragement to our hands. What I will never forget is that after the news article "For a 15-year-old student" was published in the Workers' Daily, hearts and remittance slips poured in from all over the country to Dong Heng. Some letters and remittance slips did not have the sender's name, only "A Communist Party Member," "All Communist Party Members of Our Factory," "Youth League Branch"...

My son and I, holding these heartfelt letters and hot money, could not help but shed tears of gratitude...

There is true kindness in this world. I deeply understand that all of this is because the Chinese Communist Party leads well. My son and I will forever remember the kindness of our motherland. I am truly grateful for such a mother.

    我欣慰，有这样的母亲
    1987年12月初，我的孩子董恒，突然患了世上罕见、在我国只发现了两例的威勃尔氏病。无情的病魔折磨得他全身高度浮肿，五官变形难认，消化道充血，大小便失禁……
    在绝望中，我们把董恒从内蒙古送到了北京，解放军总医院破格地收下了他。可敬的医务人员牺牲了春节和亲人团聚的宝贵时间，实行特级护理，经过200多天的全力抢救，先后有13600毫升鲜血和大量人血白蛋白等高级营养药品输入董恒体内，终于把他从死亡线上抢救过来，并转到了康复病床继续治疗。当他在1989年春节病情再度复发时，又转到了南京军区总医院抢救。经过80多天的精心治疗，孩子才安全地回到了内蒙古。现在，他正在接受恢复性治疗，生活已能自理，准备明年继续上学。
    使董恒再生的不仅仅是医生那高超的医术。我永远也无法忘记，当我因救治孩子几乎把全部家产变卖殆尽，住院拿不出必要的押金时，解放军总医院院长梁国章对我说：“我们按共产党的老规矩办，先救人要紧！”毅然收下了我生命垂危的孩子。他们先后三次请来了国内外著名的专家、教授。其中有协和医院消化系统陈圆芳教授、海军总医院副院长张百川教授、南京军区总医院副院长黎磊石教授以及本院的牟善初、蔡醒华教授，进行缜密的会诊。当董恒转院到南京后，黎磊石教授又三次组织专家会诊。这一切都是为了一个孩子呵！
    使董恒再生的也不只是医务工作者。呼和浩特铁路局工会和团委向全局职工、团员、青年发起了抢救董恒的募捐活动。短短的几天内，从沙漠深处的包兰线，到国际铁路干线集二线，人们把一批批捐款和一封封慰问信送到了我们的手中。更使我永远不能忘记的是，当《为了一个15岁的学生》的通讯在《工人日报》发表后，一颗颗心，一张张汇款单，从祖国的四面八方，飞到了董恒身边。有些来信和汇款单上，没有写自己的名字，只写着：“一名共产党员”、“我厂全体共产党员”、“团支部”……我和病中的孩子手捧着这一封封深情的信，一笔笔滚烫的钱，不由得热泪滚滚……
    人间自有真情在。我深深地懂得，所以有这一切，全是由于中国共产党领导得好。我和孩子永远牢记祖国母亲的恩情。我真欣慰，有这样的母亲。
