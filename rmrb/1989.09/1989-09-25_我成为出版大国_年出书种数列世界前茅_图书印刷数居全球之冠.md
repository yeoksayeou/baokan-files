China has become a major publishing power, with the number of books published annually ranking among the highest in the world and the number of books printed leading the globe. The ancient Eastern nation is striding forward to join the ranks of the world's major publishing countries. Since the founding of New China, the average annual increase in the number of books published has reached over 170 million copies. Currently, China publishes over 100 new books daily.

In recent years, a series of major projects that symbolize China's scientific, cultural, and publishing achievements have been completed, attracting worldwide attention. The 50-volume set of "The Complete Works of Marx and Engels" has been fully published, and China's independently edited 60-volume set of "The Complete Works of Lenin" has published 34 volumes. The 60-volume "Complete Collection of Chinese Art" has been released, and the publication of the 70-volume "Encyclopedia of China" has exceeded half. Since 1984, China has published over 1,500 various series of books.

Statistics show that since liberation, China has published over 4,500 ancient books in the fields of literature, history, and philosophy. In the past decade, the country has published 3,080 various reference books, which is equivalent to 10 times the number of similar books published in the old China over 50 years. Currently, 23 ethnic minorities with their own written languages have their own dictionaries.

At present, over 100 publishing houses have signed more than 500 cooperation agreements with overseas counterparts, publishing over 1,000 books.

    年出书种数列世界前茅
    图书印刷数居全球之冠
    据新华社北京电　（记者李光茹）我国年出书种数在世界上名列前茅，图书印刷数居全球之冠，东方古国正阔步迈入世界出版大国行列。新中国成立后，每年出书增加的平均数达1.7亿多册。现在，我国平均每天有100多种新书同读者见面。
    近年来，标志着中国科学文化和出版水平的一大批“重点工程”相继完工，引得世人瞩目。《马克思恩格斯全集》50卷本已全部出齐，我国自行编辑的中文版《列宁全集》60卷本已出34卷，60卷的《中国美术全集》已经面世，70卷本的《中国大百科全书》的出版超过一半。1984年以来我国出版的各类丛书达1500余种。
    据统计，解放以来我国仅整理出版文、史、哲方面的古籍就有4500余种。近十年间，国内共推出3080部各类工具书，相当于旧中国50年出版同类书的10倍。23个有文字的少数民族，现在都有了本民族语言的字典。
    目前已有100余家出版社同海外同行签订了500多项合作出版协议，出书1000余种。
