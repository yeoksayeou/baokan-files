Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th.

The deputy director of the European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the French Ambassador to China, Marc, today to lodge a protest over the French border police's insulting treatment of Chinese transit passengers.

The deputy director stated that on September 8th, a Chinese medical team of 13 people (including 6 women) bound for the Gabon Republic, and 8 economic and trade personnel bound for Mauritania and Sierra Leone, all holding valid diplomatic passports and transit visas issued by the French Embassy in China, as well as tickets to third countries, were subjected to unreasonable harassment and rough treatment by French border police at Paris Airport. Their passports, tickets, and handbags were forcibly taken away, and their personal freedom was violated. They were illegally detained in the baggage room for 14 and a half hours without food or drink, and were subjected to illegal body searches. This not only seriously disrupted their official duties but also caused significant harm to their health and mental well-being. Due to the cold night, many of them caught colds and stomachaches. French officials also prevented them from contacting the Chinese Embassy.

The deputy director pointed out that this incident is one of several similar incidents that have occurred at Paris Airport, despite China having lodged a protest with France on June 29th. Chinese citizens holding valid and legal documents have repeatedly been subjected to illegal personal restrictions and personal insults by French officials. The French government bears an unshakable legal and moral responsibility for this. We are indignant that the French side has ignored our serious protests and continued to seriously violate international law and customs, and brutally infringe upon human rights. We protest against this behavior.

Finally, the deputy director stated that the dignity of Chinese citizens will not be allowed to be insulted or infringed upon by anyone. We strongly demand that the French government respect international law and relevant international conventions, and immediately stop the discriminatory, harassing, and rough treatment of Chinese transit passengers. Otherwise, the French side must bear full responsibility for the consequences that arise from this.

　　外交部西欧司负责人约见法国大使
　　抗议法边防警察侮辱我过境人员
    要求法国政府立即制止这种错误做法
    新华社北京9月19日电　外交部西欧司负责人今天约见法国驻华大使马乐，奉命就巴黎机场边防警察粗暴对待中国因公过境人员一事提出交涉。
    西欧司负责人说，9月8日，中国赴加蓬共和国医疗队一行13人（其中6位妇女）以及赴毛里塔尼亚和塞拉利昂的经贸人员8人持因公出国护照并有法国驻华大使馆签发的有效过境签证以及赴第三国机票途经巴黎机场时，遭到法国边防警察无理刁难和粗暴对待。他们的护照、机票和手提包被强行取走，人身自由遭受侵犯。他们被非法关押在行李房内长达14个半小时，得不到饮食，并受到非法搜身。这不仅严重干扰了他们的公务活动，而且还使他们健康与精神受到很大的损害。由于夜间很冷，他们中间有不少人感冒和胃痛。法方人员还不准他们同中国大使馆联系。
    西欧司负责人指出，这是在巴黎机场连续多次出现类似事件和中方已于6月29日向法方进行了交涉之后发生的。中国公民持合法、有效证件旅行时，多次在法国遭到法方公务人员对他们进行非法人身限制和人格侮辱，法国政府对此负有不可推卸的法律责任和道义责任。我们对法方置中方严正交涉于不顾，继续严重违反国际法准则和国际惯例、粗暴侵犯人权的行为，感到愤慨，并就此向法方提出抗议。
    最后，西欧司负责人指出，中国公民的尊严决不容许任何人侮辱和侵犯。我们强烈要求法国政府尊重国际法准则和有关国际公约，立即制止歧视、刁难和粗暴对待中国过境人员的错误做法；否则，法方必须对由此而产生的后果负全部责任。
