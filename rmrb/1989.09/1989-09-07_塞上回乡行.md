Weizhou is located in the arid mountainous region of Ningxia, once one of the poorest places in the country. However, when we visited here in late August, we were inspired by the vibrant scene before us: the 3,000 mu of dry land in Nantian has now become level irrigated fields, with sorghum and corn growing vigorously; the natural grasslands of Baozitan, Qinglongshan, and Shiba Litan, covering a million mu, are home to plump and healthy sheep. Shepherds sing folk songs as they "fatten the sheep for autumn." Entering the town, we see rows of spacious and bright red-brick houses surrounding Kangji Temple and the Grand Mosque. Weizhou Town has undergone a dramatic transformation.

Weizhou is a small town in Tongxin County, with 3,612 households, 80% of whom are Hui people. In the past, under the influence of the "Leftist" ideology, disregarding local conditions and traditional ethnic characteristics, the focus was on "grain as the key," cutting down everything else. This area became famous for its "three dependencies": relying on grain subsidies, relying on relief for spending, and relying on loans for production. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, Weizhou Town began to leverage its local advantages and develop production in a way that suited the local conditions.

This area has a million mu of natural grasslands, known for its Weizhou sheep, whose double-layered wool skins are famous both domestically and internationally. Weizhou Town has made developing Weizhou sheep a major advantage, with every household raising sheep, from a few to a few dozen, up to four or five hundred. Now, Weizhou Town has a total of 74,400 sheep. Just the Hui farmer Ma Fengde's family raises over 500 sheep. He also started a fur processing factory and became a household with 100,000 yuan in assets, building a modern-style new brick house. Under the leadership of the Party, the town has emerged as a "fur processing specialty village." The town produces 20,000 Weizhou sheep fur blankets annually, which are exported overseas.

Weizhou is rich in mineral resources. The town has established 9 enterprises, including coal mines, white cloud rock mines, brick factories, and building material factories, with mineral products being transported both within and outside the region. Last year, the total income from collective and individual enterprises reached 4.94 million yuan, accounting for 50% of the town's total income. The town's construction team has gone as far as Egypt and other countries for labor export.

Weizhou has a historical background as an ancient trade route. "Being good at commerce" is the advantage of the people of Weizhou. After implementing the reform and opening-up policy, many Hui farmers went west to Xinjiang and south to Guangzhou, bringing Weizhou's local specialties such as fur, hair moss, and licorice out, and bringing in silk, clothing, sugar, tea, and other ethnic necessities, making the market trade volume reach around 5 million yuan annually. Hui woman entrepreneur Jin Fengping, who used to never leave home, now travels to Tianjin and Guangzhou, and her clothing business is booming! She has become wealthy, built a new brick house, and saved over 100,000 yuan.

The development of the commodity economy has brought happiness to the people of Weizhou. Now, farmers have over 600 televisions, nearly 300 washing machines, over 2,000 tape recorders and radios, 2,713 sewing machines, and 4,430 bicycles. A transport team consisting of 82 motorcycles is running on the roads. The people of Weizhou, who used to not even be able to afford a cart, now own 88 large and medium-sized tractors, 381 walk-behind tractors, 23 trucks, and large buses.

During our stay in Weizhou, we often heard moving stories of Hui-Han unity. On one day in April 1985, a massive sandstorm hit, suddenly darkening the sky and blowing sand everywhere, making it impossible to tell directions. Two Hui girls from Hongjia Shawo were blown by the sandstorm to the Han village of Tianjia Shawo, about ten miles away. Han farmer Tian Zhen, who was herding sheep, found the two girls with sand in their noses, ears, and mouths, barely breathing. He left his own flock and carried the two children home, reviving them. The next day, he harnessed a small cart and took the two children back to Hongjia Shawo. The two Hui households were so moved that they cried, saying, "If it weren't for the Han brother, our children would have died, and we wouldn't even be able to find their bodies!" Another time, Hui farmer Su Shengyi found 10 cows in the field, and after feeding them for a month, he finally found out they belonged to Han farmer Wang Fang from Xinzhuangji Township, Tiezhuangzi. When Wang Fang saw the cows, plump and round, he was so excited that he praised, "The Hui brothers have a high style!" Due to the good ethnic unity, in April of last year, Weizhou Town was commended by the State Council as a "National Advanced Collective for Ethnic Unity."

    塞上回乡行
    韦州位于宁夏的干旱山区，原是全国最贫困的地方。可是金秋8月我们到这里采访时，却被眼前的生机勃勃的景象所鼓舞：南滩3000亩昔日的干土地，如今成了平展展的水浇地，糜子、玉米等庄稼长势旺盛；豹子滩、青龙山、十八里塘百万亩天然草场上，滩羊膘肥体壮；牧羊人唱着山歌，正在“抓秋膘”。走进集镇再瞧，康济寺塔下、清真大寺周围那一幢幢宽敞明亮的红砖房鳞次栉比。韦州镇已发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    韦州是同心县的一个小镇，3612户人家，80％是回族。过去，在“左”的思想影响下，不顾当地客观条件和传统的民族特点，“以粮为纲”，别的都砍光，这里成了有名的“三靠”地区：吃粮靠回销，花钱靠救济，生产靠贷款。党的十一届三中全会后，韦州镇注意发挥本地优势，因地制宜发展生产。
    这里有100万亩天然草场，盛产滩羊，出产的九道弯滩羊二毛裘皮，驰名中外。韦州镇把发展滩羊当作一大优势，家家户户养羊，少则几只、几十只，多则四五百只。现在，韦州镇共有7.44万多只羊。仅回族农民马凤德一家就养羊500多只。他还办了皮毛加工厂，成了10万元户，盖了一院现代式样的新砖房。在党员带领下，镇里出现了一个“皮毛加工专业村”。全镇年产滩羊裘皮褥子2万条，远销国外。
    韦州有丰富的矿产资源。镇上办起了煤矿、白云岩矿、机砖厂、建材厂等9个企业，矿产品源源运往区内外。去年，集体、个体企业总收入达494万元，占全镇总收入的50％。镇上组建的一支建工队远到埃及等国搞劳务输出。
    韦州历史上是个古商道。“善商贾之道”，是韦州人的优势。韦州镇执行改革开放政策后，许多回族农民西去新疆，南下广州，把韦州的皮毛、发菜、甘草等土特产品运出去，再把绸缎、服装、糖、茶等民族用品运进来，使集市贸易年成交额达500万元左右。回族女能人金凤萍过去大门不出，如今她走天津，跑广州，服装生意做得可红火啦！她富了，盖了新砖房，积蓄上万元。
    商品经济的发展，给韦州人带来了幸福生活。现在，农民共有电视机600多台，洗衣机近300台，收录机、收音机2000多台，缝纫机2713台，自行车4430辆。一支由82辆摩托车组成的运输队，奔驰在公路上。过去连架子车都买不起的韦州人，现在买了大中型拖拉机88台，手扶拖拉机381台，卡车、大客车23辆。
    在韦州的日子里，我们还不时听到回汉团结的生动故事。1985年4月的一天，这里发生特大沙暴，突然间天昏地暗，飞沙走石，一时不辨东西。红家沙窝两户回民的两个女孩在田野里被沙暴刮到十几里外的汉民村田家沙窝。正在放羊的汉民田珍发现两个女孩鼻子、耳朵、嘴里塞满了沙子，奄奄一息。他撂下自家羊群，把两个孩子背到家里将他们救醒，第二天套上小车把两个孩子送回红家沙窝。那两户回族农民感动得热泪盈眶，说，要不是汉族大哥，我们的孩子死了还找不到尸首呢！又一次，韦州的回族农民苏生义在地里拾到10头牛，一时找不到失主，他一面把牛赶回家里喂养，一面打听失主。一直喂了一个月，最后才知道是新庄集乡铁庄子的汉族农民王芳的牛。当王芳看到喂养得滚瓜溜圆的牛时，兴奋得连声称赞：“回族兄弟风格高！”由于民族团结搞得好，去年4月，韦州镇成为受国务院表彰的“全国民族团结先进集体”。
