Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 27th.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a chairman's meeting this morning in Zhongnanhai to review the opinions and suggestions on agricultural development proposed by the CPPCC Economic Committee.

The meeting emphasized that agricultural issues are crucial to China's economic construction and social stability. We must realistically assess the agricultural situation and steadfastly implement the central government's policy that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that industrial and agricultural development should be coordinated.

The meeting decided to submit the "Opinions and Suggestions on Agricultural Development" to the Party Central Committee and the State Council. It also recommended a thorough review of the experiences and lessons from a decade of rural reforms, a deep analysis of the current problems, and the formulation of a strategic plan for future agricultural development.

Developing agriculture further is one of the key tasks of the CPPCC Economic Committee this year. After the 7th Plenary Session of the 7th CPPCC, the Economic Committee held several symposiums and dispatched investigation teams to conduct in-depth discussions and extensive investigations into the rural situation and agricultural production. They proposed constructive opinions on strengthening the agricultural foundation, deepening rural reforms, and enhancing agricultural leadership. These opinions have been noted by CPPCC Chairman Li Xiannian, who hopes to fully reflect these opinions to the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

Li Renjun, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC, presided over today's meeting.

Li Renjun, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Economic Committee, reported on the symposium on agricultural issues. He said that during the symposium, some comrades from the grassroots and agricultural experts believed that the CPPCC's focus on discussing the current agricultural issues was necessary and timely, aligning with the spirit of the 4th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party.

CPPCC Vice Chairpersons Sun Xiaocun, Qian Xuesen, Wang Guangying, Qian Weichang, Ma Wenrui, Qian Zhengying, and Zhou Peiyuan spoke at the meeting.

They believed that while the rural economy has developed rapidly over the past decade and farmers' living standards have significantly improved, the achievements are substantial. However, regarding the agricultural situation and the relationship between industry, agriculture, and urban-rural areas, a specific analysis is needed, and optimism is not warranted. If not given high priority, serious consequences may arise.

They emphasized that revitalizing agriculture is a matter of great importance and that decisive measures must be taken. They proposed that during the economic adjustment period, agricultural development should seriously implement industrial policies to maintain a reasonable balance between industrial and agricultural development. They also advocated for further reforms in the circulation and pricing systems of agricultural products, strict measures to stop illegal levies on farmers, and effective reduction of farmers' burdens. They stressed the need for healthy development of township enterprises through rectification and the promotion of agricultural science and technology. They also called for strengthening organizational leadership.

The meeting also reviewed and approved the minutes of the conference of the chairpersons of the CPPCC committees for historical and literary materials from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. It was agreed that the work of the CPPCC on historical and literary materials should better serve socialist modernization. Efforts should be made to strengthen the collection of economic and cultural materials, and to conduct research on materials related to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, overseas Chinese, ethnic minorities, and post-1949 history.

CPPCC Vice Chairpersons Kang Keqing, Zhao Puji, Qu Wu, Hu Sheng, Cheng Siyuan, Lu Jialu, Qian Zhengying, Sima Yiming Aimaidi, and Hou Jinyu attended the meeting.

    全国政协主席会议认为
    振兴农业非狠抓不可
    审议有关意见建议决定呈报党中央国务院
    新华社北京9月27日电  （记者邹爱国）全国政协今天上午在中南海召开主席会议，审议政协经济委员会提出的关于发展农业的意见与建议。
    会议提出，农业问题是关系到我国经济建设和社会安定的大事。我们要实事求是地估计农业形势，始终不渝地贯彻中央关于农业是国民经济的基础和工农业协调发展的方针。
    会议决定将《关于发展农业的意见与建议》呈报党中央、国务院，并建议认真总结农村十年改革的经验教训，深入分析当前存在的问题，研究制定今后农业发展的战略。
    如何进一步发展农业是全国政协经济委员会今年的工作重点之一。政协七届二次会议之后，政协经济委员会先后召集座谈会、派出调查组，对农村形势和农业生产状况进行了深入讨论和广泛调查，并就强化农业基础、深化农村改革、加强对农业的领导等问题提出一些建设性意见。这些意见受到全国政协主席李先念的重视，他希望把这些意见全面反映给党中央、国务院。
    全国政协副主席王任重主持了今天的会议。
    全国政协经济委员会副主任李人俊在会上汇报了关于农业问题座谈会的情况。他说，在座谈中，一些来自基层的同志和农业专家认为，全国政协抓住当前群众关心的农业问题讨论是必要的、及时的，是贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神所要办的一件有关大局的实事。
    全国政协副主席孙晓村、钱学森、王光英、钱伟长、马文瑞、钱正英、周培源，先后在会上发言。
    他们认为，改革十年，农村经济迅速发展，农民生活有了较大改善，成就是巨大的，但就农业形势和工农城乡关系状况而言，要作具体分析，不能乐观，如不引起高度重视，必将产生严重后果。
    他们认为，振兴农业，事关大局，已经到了非下大决心狠抓不可的时候。他们提出，在经济调整时期，发展农业，要认真落实产业政策，使工业与农业发展保持合理的比例，要进一步改革农产品流通体制和价格政策；要坚决制止对农民的非法摊派，切实减轻农民的负担；要通过治理整顿使乡镇企业健康发展；要切实做好科技兴农工作；要加强组织领导。
    会议还审议通过了全国各省、自治区、直辖市政协文史资料委员会主任会议纪要。大家认为，政协文史资料工作要更好地为社会主义现代化建设服务，要加强经济、文化方面资料的征集工作，开展港澳、台湾及海外资料、少数民族史料和建国以后史料的征集工作。
    全国政协副主席康克清、赵朴初、屈武、胡绳、程思远、卢嘉锡、钱正英、司马义·艾买提、侯镜如，出席了会议。
