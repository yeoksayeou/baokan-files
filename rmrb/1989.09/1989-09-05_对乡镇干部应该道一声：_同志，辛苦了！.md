Over the past few years, I have held county-level positions in Dongfeng and Dongliao counties, and have had extensive contact with township officials. My overall impression of them is that they are the busiest, most difficult, and most hardworking.

First, let's talk about how busy they are. They truly work from the moment they open their eyes until they turn off the lights. Whether it's "urging planting and harvesting, grain delivery and loans, neighbor disputes, or family planning," these are all responsibilities they cannot shirk. The birth, old age, sickness, and death of the people, as well as their clothing, food, housing, and transportation, all depend on them. The slightest negligence can lead to adverse consequences. For example, when spring plowing begins, they have to propagate rural policies, implement planting plans, and allocate procurement tasks. They also have to organize farmers to prepare the land and sow seeds, and deal with numerous meetings, inspections, and receptions.

Next, let's talk about the difficulties. Their direct supervisors, just within the county, number in the dozens. Every time a notice is issued, every time a task is proposed, every time a meeting is held, they must convey and implement it accurately (of course, these meetings are mostly necessary). Then come the inspections, summaries, praise, and criticism. These intertwined thick and thin, long and short lines all converge on them, making them the focal point of all conflicts and the concentration point of all friction. Tasks like collecting funds (unified collection, levies), demolishing houses (clearing residential bases), controlling births (family planning), and cremating the deceased (cremation) all have to be pursued house by house, one by one.

Finally, let's talk about the hardships. Township officials spend the whole year in rural areas, with a large work scope, many points of focus, a long front line, and poor conditions. Some township officials go to other places to buy cows for farmers, to save money, they eat only one meal a day, and when returning with the cows, they sit in the same cargo compartment as the cows, almost getting trampled. Some townships are located in loess hills, where even riding a bicycle is difficult due to the rugged roads. The township party committee secretary and township head often go out early and return late, "using their feet" to climb mountains and ridges, braving wind and rain to serve the farmers. They endure these hardships without complaint. However, there are other hardships that they find "unjust." For example, with fertilizer, although it is produced by the state, when it comes time to use it, they have money in hand but cannot buy fertilizer, and have no choice but to pull strings and go through back doors, euphemistically called "external cooperation." The taste of "feeling inferior" is truly unpleasant, and the price of the fertilizer they buy is higher every year, causing public dissatisfaction, and the officials are not rewarded for their efforts.

Most township officials, although busy and facing difficulties and hardships, still have a strong sense of duty and responsibility. Therefore, we should give a fair evaluation of township officials. For the price they pay to consolidate the foundation of agriculture, we should say, "Comrades, you've worked hard!"

### 对乡镇干部应该道一声：“同志，辛苦了！”

    对乡镇干部应该道一声：
    “同志，辛苦了！”
    几年来，我曾在东丰、东辽两个县先后担任过县级职务，与农村乡镇干部接触甚多。我对他们的总体印象是：工作最忙累、最困难、最辛苦。
    先说忙。称得上“两眼一睁，忙到熄灯”。什么“催种催收、交粮贷款、邻里纠纷、上环引产”等等，都是他们义不容辞的责任。群众的生老病死、衣食住行，也要靠他们操持，稍有疏忽便可能会出现不良后果。比如春耕开始了，他们既要宣传农村政策，落实种植计划、分配定购任务，又要张罗化肥、种子、农膜；既要到第一线上去发动农民整地打垄，抢墒播种，又要应付名目繁多的会议、检查、接待。
    再说难。他们的顶头上司，单就县里来说，大大小小不下七八十个部门，每发一个红头文件，每提出一项任务，每召开一次会议，都要如实传达，认真落实（当然这些会议大都是必要的）。然后跟着就是检查、总结、表扬、批评，这些密如蛛网的根根粗线、细线、长线、短线，一骨脑儿穿到一根针上，于是他们就成了诸种矛盾的聚焦点，磨擦的集中点。类似要票子（统筹、提留）、拆房子（清宅基）、刮孩子（计划生育）、烧“老子”（火化）这些硬任务，都得一家一户去催、一家一户去追，一个一个去啃。
    后说苦。乡镇干部一年四季在农村，工作面大、点多、战线长、条件差。有的乡镇干部到外地去给农民买奶牛，为了少花钱，一天一宿只吃一顿饭，往回运牛时，与牛同坐一个货车厢里，险些被牛踩坏。有的乡镇地处黄土高坡，崎岖的山路连骑自行车都费劲，乡党委书记和乡长经常是早出晚归，“开动”两脚，上山爬岭，顶风冒雨地为农民办事。吃这些苦，他们没有怨言。可另一些苦他们却吃得“冤枉”。如化肥，明明是国家生产的，可一到用肥的时候，手攥着钱买不到化肥，无奈只得四处拉关系、走后门，美其名曰搞“外协”。那种“见人矮三分”的滋味真难受，而买到的化肥一年比一年价格高，引起群众不满，干部是费力不讨好。
    多数乡镇干部虽然忙，虽有困难与苦处，但还是有着强烈的事业心和责任感。所以，我们应该公正地评价乡镇干部。对他们为巩固农业基础地位而付出的代价，应该道一声：“同志，辛苦了！”
