Windows are the eyes of a dwelling, inspiring countless thoughts and poetry, and leaving behind countless memories. There are countless ancient and modern poems and essays that are deeply connected to windows. “The moonlight shines on my bed, mistaking it for frost on the ground. I lift my head to gaze at the bright moon, and lower my head to think of my hometown.” This is a thought that begins with a window. “Open the window to face the calamus, drink wine and talk about mulberry and hemp, wait until the Double Ninth Festival, and come back to admire the chrysanthemums.” This describes how the window connects the indoor and outdoor environments, adding to the owner's living interest. Even China's current reform and opening up contains the implication of opening a window to the world... Windows not only inspire artists but also provide fresh air for politicians.

When we stroll through the Summer Palace or other classical Chinese gardens, we will continually discover rich and colorful scenic windows, lattice windows, and floor-to-ceiling windows, forming frames of various sizes, heights, distances, and perspectives, with endless scenery within a small space. When you arrive at a city at night, the lights from countless windows will leave you with an unforgettable impression. Ancient craftsmen, like women applying makeup and eyeshadow, used their best skills on windows, adding frames, carvings, painting various patterns, and inlaying colored glass, making them into pointed arches, flame shapes, and wheel shapes. Now, windows have evolved from wooden windows and steel windows to aluminum alloy with tinted glass, and windows are getting bigger and bigger. Now they have become like crystal palaces with glass curtains, making artificial spaces and nature blend into one. The functions of modern windows, in addition to the expansion of practical uses such as ventilation, sunlight, and observing the outside scenery, have even undergone a qualitative change. The windows of a building not only belong to the owner of the house, serving as a window for them to appreciate the world, but also belong to the city and the world, making the building transparent; at night, people observe another artificial world through the glass curtain, creating the so-called contemporary urban landscape of "people watching people."

From ancient times to the present, "windows and tables clean" have often been regarded as an important standard for a good living environment. Because windows are the channels for light, sound, and air, and the bridges between indoor and outdoor spaces, the design and layout of windows have become a specialized field of study. The shape, position, and construction of windows are crucial for creating a beautiful appearance and a comfortable living environment, and for the creation of architectural art images, they are the finishing touch.

How many kinds of windows are there? Even the most skilled architects cannot count them. Windows are classified by material and form in countless ways, not to mention the countless people who participate in the artistic creation of window layout. Even the same window, with different flowers on the windowsill, different curtains, blinds, air conditioners, and birdcages, will give people different feelings, reflecting the owner's different cultural qualities and personality preferences. Windows provide everyone with a place to display their environmental art talents. Many people complain that modern residential buildings in China are uniformly shaped like matchboxes with square windows, but this is not entirely true. If you carefully observe each window inside and out, there are no two completely identical windows, just as there are no two completely identical pairs of eyes.

Windows are indeed worthy of being called the eyes of architectural art. However, people often overlook their extremely rich cultural connotations and very subtle functional uses. People have not yet cherished windows as much as they cherish their eyes. For example, our window glass is often broken and dirty. Especially the windows in public residential buildings or office buildings' stairwells are dim and broken, rarely intact and clean. In window design, there are often problems with incorrect orientation and improper opening direction: windows are not opened in directions with sunlight and beautiful scenery, but instead are placed in the north or hidden directions; some want to open windows inward in the middle of the room, making it difficult to arrange beds, cabinets, and desks, and even the owner of the room cannot place a pot of jasmine on the windowsill. The windows made domestically have poor dust and noise insulation effects, becoming one of the sources of people's troubles... Human eyes blink countless times every day and use eyelashes, eyebrows, and tears to ensure the clarity and brightness of the eyes. May our windows also receive a little bit of similar care!

    窗户
    ——建筑艺术的眼睛
    顾孟潮
    窗户是住宅的眼睛，它给人多少遐想和诗意，又为人留下多少记忆。有数不尽的古今诗文与窗户结下不解之缘。“床前明月光，疑是地上霜，举头望明月，低头思故乡。”这是从窗户开始的遐思。“开窗面菖蒲，把酒话桑麻，待到重阳日，还来赏菊花。”描写的是窗子沟通室内外环境为主人增添的生活情趣。连我国目前的改革开放，也孕含着打开通向世界的窗户这一内涵……窗户不仅给艺术家灵感，也给政治家输送新鲜空气。
    当我们漫步在颐和园或者别的中国古典园林建筑之中，会不断发现丰富多彩的景窗、漏窗、落地窗，形成大小高低远近不同的画框，咫尺天地里有无尽的风光。当您在夜幕中抵达一座城市时，万家窗前的灯火构成您对它难忘的印象。古代的匠师们，像妇人描眉、作眼影一样都把最好的技艺用到窗子上，加窗框，作雕刻，描绘上各种图案，镶上彩色玻璃，作成尖拱形，火焰形，车轮形。现在，窗户已由木窗、钢窗，发展到铝合金加茶色玻璃，而且窗户越开越大，如今变成像水晶宫一样的玻璃幕墙，使人造空间和大自然联成一气。现代的窗户的功能除了通风、日照、观察窗外景致等实际用途的扩展，甚至发生了质变，一幢建筑物的窗户，不仅属于这幢房屋的主人，是他观赏世界的窗户，而且属于城市、属于世界，使建筑成为透明的了；夜晚，人们透过玻璃幕墙，观察人造的另一个世界，出现所谓“人看人”的当代城市景观。
    古往今来常把“窗明几净”当作居住环境美好的重要标准。因为窗户是光线、声音、空气的通道，内外空间的桥梁，所以窗户的设计和布置成了一门专门的学问。窗户的形状、位置、作法，对于创造优美的观瞻、舒适的使用环境至关重要，对于建筑艺术形象的创造更是画龙点睛之笔。
    窗户到底有多少种？即使高明的建筑师也数不清。窗子按材料和形式分类多得无法计算，况且参予窗户布置艺术创造的人更是以千万计。同是一个窗户，窗台摆上不同的花卉，加上不同的窗帘、百叶窗、空调箱、鸟笼，就会给人不同的感受，体现主人不同的文化气质和性格爱好。窗户为每个人提供了发挥环境艺术才能的用武之地。不少人埋怨我国现代住宅千篇一律地用火柴盒体型和方窗户，其实并不尽然，只要仔细观察每一个窗户内外，没有完全相同的两个窗户，如同没有完全相同的两双眼睛。
    窗户，无愧于建筑艺术的眼睛。然而人们往往忽略它那无比丰富的文化内涵和十分细微的使用功能。人们更远远没有像爱护眼睛那样来爱护它。比如，我们的窗玻璃往往是破碎的，肮脏的。特别是公共住宅或办公楼的楼梯间的窗户，昏暗破漏，很少完好明净。在窗户的设计上往往出现朝向不对、开启方向不当：在有阳光有美景的方向不开窗户，偏偏在朝北、向隅方向设窗；有的想在房间当中向内开窗，使床柜桌等家具很难布置，甚至房主人想在窗台上摆一盆君子兰也实现不了。国内制造的窗户隔尘、隔音的效果很差，成了人们烦恼的来源之一……人类的眼睛，每天不知要眨多少次，还用睫毛、眉毛和泪水来保证眼睛的晶莹、明亮。愿我们的窗户，多多少少也得到一点类似的关照吧！
