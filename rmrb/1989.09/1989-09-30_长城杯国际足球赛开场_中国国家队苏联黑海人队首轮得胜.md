The Great Wall Cup International Football Tournament Begins: China National Team Defeats Soviet Black Sea Team in the First Round

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th. Reporter Wāng Dàzhāo reports: The 1989 Great Wall Cup International Football Tournament kicked off tonight at the Xiannongtan Stadium in Beijing. In the first round, the China National Team defeated the China Olympic Team 2:0, and the Soviet Black Sea Team won 1:0 against the North Korean Pyongyang Team.

The two goals for the Chinese team were scored by player number 7, Xiè Yùxīn. In the first half, the two teams from the host country engaged in a rapid exchange of attacks. The China Olympic Team seized the initiative and created an opportunity, but failed to execute a powerful shot on goal. Midfielder Xiè Yùxīn, from about seven or eight meters in front of the opponent's goal, lifted the ball and scored with an overhead kick. Shortly after the start of the second half, Xiè Yùxīn scored his second goal from a very tight angle near the sideline.

The Soviet Black Sea Team, which had just arrived by plane this afternoon, relied on their height and strength advantages and concise techniques to dominate the field. They scored a goal with a low shot from the left foot by player number 11, Pèilèpàjiānkē.

    长城杯国际足球赛开场
    中国国家队苏联黑海人队首轮得胜
    本报北京9月29日电　记者汪大昭报道：1989年长城杯国际足球锦标赛今晚在北京先农坛体育场进行首轮交锋。中国国家队以2∶0战胜中国奥林匹克队，苏联黑海人队以1∶0赢了朝鲜平壤队。
    中国队的两个进球由7号谢育新一人包办。上半时，东道主的两支球队展开一阵快速对攻，中国奥林匹克队抢先打出了机会，但未能施以有力的攻门。中国国家队前卫谢育新在对方门前七八米远的地方将球挑起，凌空倒钩破网。下半时开始不久，谢育新又在底线附近角度很小的地方踢进了第二个球。
    今天中午刚下飞机的苏联黑海人队凭借身高体壮的优势和简练的技术，在场上占据上风，并由11号佩列帕坚科一记左脚低射得分。
