The United States is currently the most economically developed country in the world. Interestingly, it is also the world's largest debtor nation, with national debt approaching $3 trillion. Only because of its strong economic foundation and considerable leeway does it avoid an obvious economic crisis.

Debt has always been a matter of social concern. To provide the public with timely information on the national debt and to raise social awareness, a giant electronic clock, called the "National Debt Clock," has been erected at the intersection of 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas in the heart of New York City, just one street away from the bustling Times Square. This 8-meter-long, 3-meter-wide clock, valued at $120,000, continuously displays the amount of U.S. national debt.

By the end of the first half of 1989, the clock showed a national debt of $2.7396 trillion. This amount is equivalent to 56% of the current U.S. annual GDP and 16.5% of the global annual GDP. In 1988, the total external debt of Third World countries was $1.3 trillion, while the U.S. national debt was 1.1 times that amount, illustrating the enormity of the debt. The problem does not end there; it continues to grow. The National Debt Clock shows that it increases at an average rate of $280,000 per hour, adding approximately $25 billion per year. Such a massive debt requires annual interest payments of over $200 billion, equivalent to 4% of the U.S. annual GDP. It is no wonder that some people consider the U.S. national debt to be one of the most difficult problems to solve, alongside issues such as drug trafficking and abuse, gun proliferation, teenage pregnancy, and racial conflicts.

　　美国国债知多少
    美国是目前世界上经济发达的国家，但有趣的是，它同时又是世界上最大的债务国，目前的国债已接近3万亿美元。只是因为它的经济基础雄厚，有较大的回旋余地，才没有爆发明显的经济危机。
    债务一向是社会关注的问题，为了随时向社会提供国债数额并引起社会的警戒，在纽约市中心的第42街和美利坚大街交汇口，即在离最繁忙的时代广场只有一街之隔的地方，立起了一个巨大的电子钟，叫“国债钟”，这个长8米、宽3米，价值12万美元的大钟随时显示美国的国债数额。
    1989年上半年末，这个钟显示的国债数是27396亿美元，它相当于美国目前年国民生产总值的56％，相当于全球年国民生产总值的16.5％。1988年第三世界国家的外债总额为1.3万亿美元，而美国的国债是它的1.1倍，可见数额之巨大。问题还不止于此，它还在不断增长。国债钟显示，它平均以每小时28万美元的速度增长着，一年大约增加25亿美元。如此巨大的债务，一年需要付出的利息约在2000亿美元以上，相当于美国一年国民生产总值的4％。无怪乎有人认为，在国债、贩毒吸毒、枪支泛滥、未婚先孕和种族纠纷等严重社会问题中，美国的国债是最难解决的问题之一。（余洋）
