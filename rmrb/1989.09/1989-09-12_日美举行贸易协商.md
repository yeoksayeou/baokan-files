Japan and the United States held the first round of consultations on trade structural obstacles in Tokyo over two days starting on September 4, exploring ways to fundamentally resolve the long-standing economic friction between the two countries.

The primary background for the consultations on economic structural issues between Japan and the United States is the long-term trade imbalance between the two countries. Since the mid-1960s, Japan's trade with the United States has shifted from a deficit to a surplus. Since then, the surplus amount has continued to increase. During this period, the two sides have repeatedly argued over textiles, televisions, automobiles, semiconductors, supercomputers, beef, and citrus fruits. The friction has expanded from goods to technology and finance, and has now evolved into a comprehensive "compound friction." As a result, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains high, and Japan's share of the U.S. trade deficit has risen from about one-third in the mid-1980s to about one-half. The United States believes that the fundamental cause is Japan's barriers to U.S. imports, and that these barriers are related to Japan's domestic economic structure. Therefore, negotiating individual product frictions cannot fundamentally solve the trade problem. Soon after taking office, Bush proposed consultations on structural obstacles. At the July summit of Western countries in Paris, the leaders of Japan and the United States agreed to hold consultations on structural issues twice a month starting in September, with an interim report scheduled for next April and a final report for next summer.

What is the crux of the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States? From the issues raised in the Japan-U.S. consultations, the two countries' views are not entirely consistent. The United States demands that Japan improve its pricing system, distribution system, savings and investment, land policy, and financial system, and change its practice of excluding foreign goods, while Japan demands that the United States improve its low savings and excessive consumption, insufficient equipment investment, lack of export efforts, and vocational training and education. In short, the approach is to address the economic friction from the perspective of macroeconomic structure and explore ways to cure it. This round of consultations is in the stage of exchanging views and has not touched on the issue of solutions. After the first round of consultations, Japan and the United States reached a consensus to quickly start researching the issue of Japan increasing imports and the United States expanding exports, and to jointly investigate the issue of price differences for Japanese goods in the domestic market.

Although the first round of consultations did not have a strong confrontational tone, both sides did not lack a sense of urgency. Before the consultations began, during the Japan-U.S. summit, Bush had this to say: "If the consultations on structural issues fail and the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States continues to widen, it will lead to a deterioration in relations between the two countries." For the long-standing economic friction and the complex structural obstacles, it is no easy task to come up with a cure-all prescription after five rounds of consultations in one year, especially since the U.S. side is eager to see concrete results in the interim report in April next year.

Japan initially thought it was not advisable to rush, but later expressed its intention to do its best. Japan also realizes that, as the largest creditor nation with a huge trade surplus, if it does not take a positive attitude in solving the obvious structural obstacles, it will not only increase U.S. distrust of Japan but also provoke dissatisfaction among domestic consumers. Public opinion hopes that the consultations on structural obstacles between Japan and the United States will make progress, which will be beneficial for both countries and can provide a reference for solving problems in multilateral international trade.

### 日美举行贸易协商

　　日美举行贸易协商
　　本报记者　于青
　　9月4日起两天来，日美两国的政府代表团在东京举行了第一轮贸易结构性障碍问题协商，探讨从根本上解决旷日持久的经济摩擦的途径。
    日美间举行经济结构性问题协商的主要背景是两国间长期性的贸易不平衡。自60年代中期开始，日本对美贸易由逆差转为顺差。此后，顺差数额不断增大。其间，双方先后围绕纺织品、电视、汽车、半导体、巨型计算机、牛肉、柑桔等争吵不休。摩擦进而从物品发展到技术、金融等领域，而今演化成为整体型的“复合摩擦”。其结果，美国对日贸易逆差仍居高不下，在美国对外贸易赤字中，日本所占比例从80年代中期的1／3上升到约1／2。美国认为其根本原因是日本对美国的进口设置障碍，而且这种障碍与日本国内的经济结构有关。因而只就个别产品摩擦举行谈判，无法根本解决贸易问题。布什就任总统不久就提出结构性障碍问题协商的建议。在7月的巴黎西方国家首脑会晤中，日美两国首脑同意，从9月开始，两个月举行一次结构性问题协商，预定明年4月提出协商的中间报告，明年夏天提出最终报告。
    日美贸易不平衡的症结何在？从日美协商提出的议题看，两国认识不尽一致。美国要求日本改善价格体系、流通制度、储蓄和投资、土地政策和金融体系，改变排斥外来商品的一贯作法，而日本则要求美国改善低储蓄和过度消费、设备投资不足、出口努力不够以及职业训练和教育等问题。总之是从宏观经济结构入手，探讨根治经济摩擦的办法。这次协商属于交换看法阶段，没有涉及解决措施问题。第一轮协商闭幕后，日美双方达成一致意见，尽快着手研究日本增加进口和美国扩大出口的问题，并联合调查日本商品的国内价格差问题。
    第一轮协商虽然火药味不浓，但双方却不无紧迫感。协商开始前的日美首脑会谈中，布什总统有言在先：“如果结构性问题协商失败，日美贸易不平衡继续扩大，将导致两国关系恶化。”对于旷日持久的经济摩擦、错综复杂的结构性障碍问题，要在一年内5轮协商之后，开出药到病除的处方笺，实非易事，况且美国方面还急于在明年4月的中间报告中看到具体成果。
    日本方面先是认为不宜操之过急，后又表示尽力而为。日本也意识到，身为持有巨额贸易顺差的最大债权国，如果在解决显而易见的结构性障碍问题上不作出积极的姿态，不仅会增加美国的对日不信任感，还会引起国内消费者的不满。舆论期待日美结构性障碍问题协商取得进展，既有益于日美双边，也能为解决多边国际贸易中存在的问题有所借鉴。
