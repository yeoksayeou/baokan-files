    Beijing Municipal Construction Workers Hospital has applied arthroscopy to diagnose and treat knee joint diseases in 800 cases, achieving a 95% accurate diagnosis rate and a 90% effective treatment rate. This method involves making only a 5mm incision to insert the arthroscope for observation and surgery. Unlike traditional treatments, which require patients to stay in bed for two weeks post-surgery, patients can get out of bed the very next day. This is a doctor from the hospital using an arthroscope to remove a meniscus for a patient.

    北京市建筑工人医院应用膝关节镜检查治疗膝关节病800例，正确诊断率达95％，治疗有效率达90％。用此法只切开5毫米的小口子，将关节镜插入观察，实施手术。传统治疗术后两周才能下床，现在一天即能下床。这是该院大夫借助关节镜为病人切除半月板。　吴金明摄
