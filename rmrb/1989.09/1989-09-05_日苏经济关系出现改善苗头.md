	Improvements in Sino-Soviet Economic Relations
	New China News Agency reporter Zhang Kexi

	With the conclusion of the twelfth session of the Sino-Soviet Economic Joint Committee, Sino-Soviet economic relations have begun to improve. However, due to various obstacles, significant progress is unlikely in the short term.

	The twelfth session of the Sino-Soviet Economic Joint Committee was held in Moscow from August 23 to 25. During the meeting, both sides agreed to actively promote joint ventures, collaborate on the construction of a large pulp mill in Sakhalin, establish a "Far East Committee" within the Joint Committee to develop the Soviet Far East region, and send a delegation of Soviet enterprises to visit Japan.

	Sino-Soviet economic relations have been in a state of coldness since the mid-1980s due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the "Toshiba Machine Company incident." Since last year, Sino-Soviet economic relations have become more active, with bilateral trade reaching $5.896 billion, setting a historical record. At this meeting, the Soviet Union took a positive attitude, even presenting a list of military technologies that could be converted to civilian use to the Japanese delegation, which surprised the Japanese media. This indicates that under Gorbachev's "reform" line, the Soviet Union has high expectations for economic cooperation with Japan.

	The Japanese delegation believes that the Soviet Union has outlined a new policy for Sino-Soviet economic cooperation. The content is: the Soviet side is not rigidly pursuing large-scale cooperative development projects and is willing to actively develop trade relations between enterprises; focusing on the Far East region, vigorously promoting the establishment of joint ventures for the production of consumer goods; Soviet exports will shift from mainly raw materials to mainly semi-finished products.

	Japanese businessmen view the Soviet Union's attitude as "realistic" and "constructive," and are willing to deepen exchanges with the Soviet Union. The Japanese economic sector, in order to expand exports and secure industrial raw materials, intends to adopt a "political-economic separation" approach to strengthen economic relations with the Soviet Union.

	However, the Japanese government, represented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, still adopts an attitude of "territorial issues first," advocating that politics and economics cannot be separated, and using economic strength as a card in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the economic sector's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union will inevitably be constrained by the government. In addition, the Soviet Far East region has harsh natural conditions, backward infrastructure such as roads and ports, and various unfavorable factors in the Soviet social and economic system, making it difficult to become an ideal investment destination for Japanese businessmen.

	Observers here believe that due to the above-mentioned obstacles, although Sino-Soviet trade will develop in the future, economic and technological cooperation is unlikely to make significant progress in the short term.

### 日苏经济关系出现改善苗头

    日苏经济关系出现改善苗头
    新华社记者　张可喜
    以刚结束的第十二次日苏经济混合委员会会议为转机，日苏经济关系开始改善，但由于种种障碍存在，短时期内难以取得重大进展。
    第十二次日苏经济混合委员会会议于八月二十三日至二十五日在莫斯科举行。会上双方一致同意，今后积极推进合办企业，联合在萨哈林建设大型纸浆厂，为开发苏远东地区而在混合委员会中新设“远东委员会”，苏派企业代表团访问日本等。
    日苏经济关系由于苏军入侵阿富汗和日本的“东芝机械公司事件”，八十年代中期以来一直陷于冷淡状态。自去年起日苏经济关系开始活跃，双边贸易达五十八点九六亿美元，创历史最高纪录。在这次会议上，苏联态度积极，甚至向日本代表团提出了可转作民用的军事技术清单，使日本报界感到异乎寻常。这说明，在戈尔巴乔夫的“改革”路线下，苏联对同日本的经济合作抱有极大期望。
    日方代表团认为，苏联表明了新的日苏经济合作方针。其内容是：苏方不拘泥于搞大规模的合作开发项目，愿积极发展企业之间的贸易关系；以远东地区为中心，大力兴办生产消费品的合资企业；苏出口产口将从以原材料为主改变到以半成品为主。
    对苏联的态度，日本企业家认为是“现实主义的”、“建设性的”，并愿意与苏加深交流。日本经济界为了扩大出口和确保工业原材料，有意采取“政治经济分离”的方式，加强对苏经济关系。
    但是以外务省为代表的日本政府仍然采取“领土问题优先”的态度，主张政治经济不可分离，要把经济实力当作一张对苏谈判的王牌，因此，经济界的对苏经济合作将不可避免地受到政府的牵制。此外，苏联远东地区自然条件恶劣，道路、港湾等设施落后，再加上苏联社会经济体制的种种不利因素，使之难以成为日本企业家理想的投资场所。
    此间观察家认为，由于上述种种障碍，虽然日苏贸易今后会有所发展，但是经济技术合作却难以在短时期内取得重大进展。
