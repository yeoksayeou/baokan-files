In recent years, retrieving gold, silver, and jewels from sunken ships has become a lucrative business. With the widespread use of advanced equipment such as underwater robots, sonar systems, and high-sensitivity cameras, exploring deep-sea wrecks has become much easier than before.

In April of this year, the American company Sea Hunters discovered an ancient Spanish sailing ship at the bottom of the sea, about 110 kilometers off the coast of Florida. It is estimated that the ship is carrying coins, silver ingots, and gemstones worth millions of dollars. The company is planning to make another fortune.

This has sparked opposition from some people, especially archaeologists, who believe that such practices should be banned as they are equivalent to looting ancient tombs. For example, the British luxury liner that sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 was discovered in 1985, and its contents were plundered. This incident was condemned by public opinion. The shipwreck claimed the lives of 1,513 passengers, and people regard the ship as a collective underwater grave, which should not be disturbed, let alone have the belongings of the deceased stolen.

In the eyes of archaeologists, ancient shipwrecks are like ancient cities or tombs buried underground. Their remains and the site should not be destroyed but should be investigated, studied, and analyzed by archaeologists to gain a more accurate understanding of history. Jackson Walter, director of the American Historical Preservation Trust, said that the Sea Hunters' plan to make money will irreparably destroy historical records.

The current problem is that archaeological organizations and individuals currently lack the funds to undertake the enormous expenses of investigating sunken ships, while salvage companies with the financial means and equipment only recognize "shiny things as gold" and do not understand their historical value. Therefore, some archaeologists advocate for the enactment of laws to prohibit anyone from disturbing the contents of sunken ships within a certain time frame. Others suggest that the antiquities market should prohibit the buying and selling of such illegal artifacts.

    海底探宝与考古
    近年来，从沉船中捞取金银珠宝，成了一种发大财的行当。由于潜水机器人、声纳系统、高灵敏度摄影机等先进设备的广泛使用，从深海沉船探宝比以前容易多了。
    今年四月，美国海鹰打捞公司，在距佛罗里达州一百一十公里的海底发现一艘古代西班牙帆船，估计船上载有价值千百万美元的钱币、银锭和宝石。该公司准备再去发一次财。
    这引起一些人特别是考古学家的反对，他们认为这类做法应予禁止，因为它和盗掘古墓无异。例如：一九一二年触冰山沉没的英国巨型豪华客轮在一九八五年被发现后，船上的财物被洗劫一空。此事受到舆论的谴责。当年的那次海难有一千五百一十三名乘客与轮船一同葬身海底，人们把那艘船视为一座海底集体坟墓，不宜触动，更不应盗取死难者的财物。
    在考古学家看来，古代沉船和埋在地下的古代城市或坟墓一样，其残骸和现场不应破坏，而应由考古学家进行调查、研究和分析，以便对历史有更准确的了解。美国历史保护信托所主任杰克逊·瓦尔特说，海鹰公司的发财计划将不可弥补地破坏掉历史资料。
    现在的问题是：考古学团体和个人目前都无力承担探查沉船的庞大费用，而有财力和设备的打捞公司则只认得“发亮的东西是黄金”，不懂得其历史价值。所以，一些考古学家主张制订法律，在一定期限内，任何人不许触动沉船中的东西。另一些人则主张，古物市场应禁止买卖这类非法文物。
