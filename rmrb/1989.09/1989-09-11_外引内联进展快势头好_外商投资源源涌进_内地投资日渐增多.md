Foreign Investment Flows In, Domestic Investment Increases

	BEIJING, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- The rapid progress in attracting external investment and linking with domestic resources in Hainan, a province that relies mainly on attracting foreign capital for its economic development, has not been affected by the nationwide tightening of monetary policy and the June Fourth counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, according to officials of the Hainan Provincial Economic Cooperation Bureau.

	The bureau said that from September 1987, when the province was established, to the end of July this year, a total of 703 joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises had been approved, with a total contract investment of 865.79 million U.S. dollars. A total of 3,230 joint ventures and wholly domestic-owned enterprises had been approved, with a total contract investment of 66.81 billion yuan. Foreign investors have actually invested nearly 200 million U.S. dollars, and domestic investors have invested even more.

	The bureau said that Hainan's efforts to attract external investment and link with domestic resources have the following three characteristics:

	-- Steady investment momentum. Despite the impact of the nationwide tightening of monetary policy and the June Fourth counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the number of enterprises investing in Hainan and the amount of investment have fluctuated but have not experienced sharp rises and falls. Instead, they have shown a trend of development. So far, more than 10 countries and regions have set up enterprises in Hainan, and more than 70 representative offices have been established. Except for Tibet, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the country have set up enterprises and representative offices in Hainan.

	-- High proportion of foreign and inter-provincial investment. Statistics show that in the three types of enterprises, foreign investors have invested 658.28 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 76 percent of the total contract investment. Domestic investors have invested 55.17 billion yuan, accounting for 82.6 percent of the total contract investment.

	-- Rational investment direction. This year, 71 percent of the three types of enterprises in Hainan have been engaged in basic industries, transportation, and agriculture. More than 50 percent of the domestic investment enterprises have been engaged in the development of industry and agriculture.

	The rapid development of external attraction and internal linkage in Hainan is due to the fact that the province has rich land, mineral, aquatic, and tropical crop resources. In particular, it enjoys more special and preferential policies than other economic special zones in China, which has always attracted domestic and foreign entrepreneurs to invest and develop in Hainan. The reason why Hainan's foreign investment has not declined is that the central government and the provincial party committee and government have taken appropriate measures, the situation in Hainan is stable, the policy of reform and opening up has not changed, and the implementation of special policies has not changed.

### 外引内联进展快势头好　外商投资源源涌进　内地投资日渐增多

　　外引内联进展快势头好
　　外商投资源源涌进　内地投资日渐增多
    本报讯　以引进资金为主进行特区经济建设的海南，在全国性银根紧缩和北京反革命暴乱发生后，外引内联工作是否受到影响？日前，记者从海南省经济合作厅获悉：这项工作进展迅速，成绩喜人。
    据省经济合作厅介绍，从1987年9月筹备建省到今年7月底止，全省共审批新办中外合资、中外合作、外商独资企业703家，合同投资总额86579万美元；审批内联、内地独资企业3230家，合同投资总额668109万元人民币。外商实际投资近2亿美元，内地投资数目更大。海南外引内联还具有以下三个特点：
    ——投资势头平稳发展。经历全国性银根紧缩和北京反革命暴乱冲击后，来海南的投资企业数、投资额虽有起伏，但没有大起大落，而且呈发展趋势。目前，已有10多个国家和地区来海南办企业，设办事处70多个；国内除西藏外，其他省、市、区都来海南办企业、设办事处。
    ——外商、外省投资比例大。据统计，三资企业中，外商出资额达65828万美元，占合同投资总额76％；内地投资企业出资额达551711万元人民币，占投资合同总额82.6％。
    ——资金投向合理。今年以来，三资企业在海南从事基础工业、交通业和农业的占71％，内地投资企业从事工农等实业开发的占50％以上。
    海南外引内联发展快，原因是这里拥有丰富的土地、矿产、水产、热带作物等资源，尤其是这里享有比我国其他经济特区更特殊、更优惠的政策，因而一直吸引着海内外企业家来海南投资开发。海南的外来投资没滑坡，主要因为中央和省委、省府措施得当，海南局势稳定，改革开放政策不变，实行特殊政策不变。
