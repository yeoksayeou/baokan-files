The Tale of 28 "Silver Dollars"

Li Jinbang, a 61-year-old resident of Dagutai Village, Gaojimi Town, Shishou City, Hubei Province, has, over the past five years, managed to save some money through small-scale business ventures. However, he did not deposit this money in a credit union. One day, two con artists specializing in counterfeit silver dollars persuaded the elderly man to exchange his money for these coins, claiming that storing them was more reliable than keeping money in a credit union. The kind-hearted and honest old man believed them and exchanged 1,120 yuan in cash for 28 "silver dollars." After the con artists fled, the old man discovered that all the silver dollars were fake. For days, the old man has been counting these 28 fake silver dollars with a worried expression, sighing and lamenting.

　　28块“银元”的诉说
    湖北石首市高基庙镇打鼓台村六十一岁的李金榜，五年来靠小本经营好不容易积攒了一些钱，可他没存入信用社。一天，两个专门换假银元的骗子撺掇老人调换银元，说什么存这玩意比钱存信用社可靠。善良忠厚的老人信以为真，拿一千一百二十元现金调换了二十八块“银元”。骗子逃后，老人才发现这银元全是假的。几天来，老人总是满面愁容地数着这二十八块假银元，唉声叹气。
