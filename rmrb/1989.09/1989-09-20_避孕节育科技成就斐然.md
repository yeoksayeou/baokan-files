Following the principle of "providing safe, effective, convenient, and reversible contraception and family planning technologies and methods for couples of childbearing age," China has made significant achievements in the scientific and technological research of family planning over the past decade. Some projects have reached international leading levels.

- Professor Li Shunqiang from the Chongqing Family Planning Research Institute invented the "vas deferens direct vision clip method" and the "transdermal vas deferens injection occlusion method." These methods have been recognized by the international academic community as safe, efficient, convenient, and economical male sterilization methods and are being promoted both domestically and internationally. Currently, over 8.8 million men of childbearing age in China have adopted these two methods for contraception.

- Zhao Shengcai, director of Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, created the "vas deferens reversible occlusion surgery." A single injection can achieve a 99% effective rate for contraception. If fertility is desired, another injection to remove the occlusion can achieve a 100% success rate for restoring fertility. This method has been clinically verified in over 100,000 cases domestically and internationally, refuting the claim that male sterilization can induce heart disease.

- Intrauterine devices (IUDs) account for approximately 41% of contraceptive measures used by women in China. Through various improvements in shape and material, the reliability of IUDs has continuously increased, while usage reactions and side effects have decreased. They are well-received by users, with over 60 million women nationwide currently using them.

- Female sterilization surgeries account for about 36% of contraceptive measures. In recent years, there have been continuous improvements in effectiveness and reduction of complications, with notable progress in reversible research. In the field of non-surgical sterilization, the non-visual fallopian tube insertion and drug injection sterilization method has been successfully pioneered.

- In the development of oral contraceptives, China has entered the ranks of world leaders, with a full range of products and self-sufficiency. In recent years, significant breakthroughs have been made in the research of early and mid-pregnancy termination drugs. Drugs such as cottonseed powder, dyer's woad, prostaglandin, and Ru486 now use only 1/8 of the original dosage, with unchanged effectiveness. There are nine types of contraceptive pills specifically developed for couples who are temporarily separated, with an effectiveness rate of over 98%. These pills are widely used domestically and are also well-received in the international market.

- Two types of traditional Chinese medicine extracts with over 90% effectiveness in terminating pregnancies have been developed; research on male contraceptive drugs, cottonseed phenol, and tripterygium wilfordii, is progressing, attracting significant international interest. Long-acting sustained-release drugs such as contraceptive injections and subcutaneous implants are beginning to be promoted in rural areas.

- In theoretical research on male and female reproductive regulation, reproductive physiology, immunology, contraception, and family planning epidemiology and social medicine, China has also achieved many important results, some of which have been widely applied by international peers.

　　避孕节育科技成就斐然
　　宗河
    遵循着“为育龄夫妇提供安全有效、简便可逆的避孕节育技术和方法”这一原则，10多年来，我国在计划生育方面的科学技术研究取得显著成绩，有一些项目已达到国际领先水平。
    ——重庆市计划生育研究所教授李顺强发明的“输精管直视钳穿法”和“经皮输精管注射粘堵法”，国际学术界已公认是一种安全、高效、简便、经济的男性节育好方法，正在国内外推广。
    目前我国已有880多万育龄男性采用了这两种方法节育。
    ——山西省人民医院院长赵生才创造的输精管可复性栓堵术，只打一针就能达有效率99％的节育效果。如需复育，再打一针取栓，复育成功率100％。
    经国内外10万多例临床验证，这种方法还否定了男性结扎可诱发心脏病的说法。
    ——宫内节育器的使用约占我国妇女避孕措施中的41％，由于多方改进其形态和质地，可靠性不断提高，使用反应和副作用不断减少，受到使用者欢迎，目前全国已有6000多万妇女使用。
    ——女性结扎手术约占节育措施的36％，在提高效果和减少并发症方面，近年不断出现新的成果，并在可复性研究方面取得了可喜进展。
    在非手术绝育方面，还成功地首创了非直视下输卵管插管注药绝育术。
    ——口服避孕药的研制，我国已进入世界先进行列，不仅品种齐全，还能自给自足。
    近年，在抗早、中孕药物研究方面取得重大突破。
    天花粉、芫花帖、前列腺素和Ru486等药物，现在的剂量只是原使用剂量的1／8，而有效率不变。
    专为夫妻分居家庭研制的探亲避孕药有9种之多，有效率达98％以上，不仅国内广泛使用，国际市场也十分欢迎。
    ——两种中断妊娠效果达90％以上的中草药提炼制剂已推出；棉酚和雷公藤两种男性节育药的研究进展，在国际上属首次，使国外同行大感兴趣；避孕针及皮下埋制剂等长效缓释药物已开始在农村推广。
    ——在男女性生殖调节、生殖生理学、免疫学、避孕和家庭计划的流行病学及社会医学等理论方面的研究，我国也取得了相当多的重要成果，有的已被国际同行广应用。
