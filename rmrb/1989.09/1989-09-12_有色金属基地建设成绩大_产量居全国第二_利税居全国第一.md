The construction of the non-ferrous metal base has achieved significant results, with production ranking second in the country and profits and taxes ranking first.

“In the east, there is Liaoning; in the west, there is Gansu.” Although Gansu started later, it has now become an important production base for non-ferrous metals in China.

Gansu has extremely rich non-ferrous metal resources. Over 20 types of non-ferrous metal ores have been discovered, with more than 60 ore deposits. The reserves of nickel, cobalt, lead, zinc, and antimony rank among the top five in the country. The Jinchuan nickel-copper mine, which Deng Xiaoping called the "golden child," has the largest reserves of nickel, platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium in the country, and its copper metal reserves rank second only to Jiangxi Dexing. The largest lead-zinc mine currently being developed in China, the Xicheng mining area in Gansu, has already secured lead-zinc reserves of over 12 million tons, with potential reserves reaching 20 million tons.

As early as the late primitive society, the ancestors living in Gansu were already using bronze objects. The bronze dagger unearthed in Dongxiang Linjia from around 3000 BC and the bronze dagger unearthed in Yongding Liancheng Jiangjiaping from around 2300 BC are the earliest bronze artifacts unearthed in China to date. However, over the long years, these rich treasures could only sleep underground. When the wheel of history turned to 1949, Gansu's metallurgical products only amounted to 83 tons of pig iron, with not a single ounce of non-ferrous metals.

With the founding of New China, the first large-scale non-ferrous metal mining and smelting integrated enterprise in China, the Baiyin Non-Ferrous Metals Company, began construction, and in 1960, it produced electrolytic copper. In 1960, the construction of China's "nickel capital"—the Jinchuan Non-Ferrous Metals Company—began, and in 1964, it produced nickel smelting products. Following this, a series of key enterprises, including the Northwest Copper Processing Plant, Northwest Aluminum Processing Plant, Lanzhou Aluminum Plant, Lanzhou Liancheng Aluminum Plant, Gansu Rare Earth Company, Longxi Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Machinery Plant, and Gansu Aluminum Plant, were successively built and put into operation in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Along with the establishment of design research institutes, mining and smelting research institutes, geological exploration companies, and two construction companies, Gansu Province has formed a complete non-ferrous metal industrial system.

In 1983, with the reform of the non-ferrous metal industry management system, a number of large and medium-sized enterprises were directly managed by the Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, with the national interest in mind, proposed a series of plans to revitalize the provincial economy by taking the non-ferrous metal industry as the leading sector. In 1984, the Provincial Government signed an agreement with the Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation on "comprehensive cooperation and accelerating the development of Gansu's non-ferrous metal industry." In recent years, despite severe power shortages in the province, the Provincial Government has allocated more than 30% of industrial electricity to ensure the production of large and medium-sized enterprises under the Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation. In 1988, the province's production of 10 types of non-ferrous metals reached 212,700 tons, ranking second in the country. Among these, nickel and aluminum production accounted for 88.29% and 17.49% of the national total, respectively, ranking first in the country. The profits and taxes realized were 1.14 times higher than in 1983, with both profits and taxes ranking first in the country.

### 有色金属基地建设成绩大　产量居全国第二　利税居全国第一

　　有色金属基地建设成绩大
　　产量居全国第二　利税居全国第一
    “东有辽宁，西有甘肃”。起步较晚的甘肃，如今已成我国有色金属的重要生产基地。
    甘肃有极其丰富的有色金属资源。现已探明有色金属矿20多种，矿床60余处，镍、钴、铅、锌、锑等储量居全国前5位。被邓小平同志称之为“金娃娃”的金川镍铜矿，其镍、铂、钯、锇、铱、铑储量居全国之冠，铜金属储量仅次于江西德兴。我国目前正在开发的最大铅锌矿——甘肃西成矿区，已掌握的铅锌储量达1200多万吨，远景储量可达2000万吨。
    早在原始社会晚期，居住在甘肃的人类祖先就已使用青铜器物。在甘肃东乡林家出土的公元前3000年的青铜刀和永登连城蒋家坪出土的公元前2300年的残铜刀，是我国迄今为止出土的最早的两件青铜器。然而，在漫长的岁月里，丰富的宝藏只能沉睡于地下。当历史的车轮转到1949年，甘肃的冶金产品只有83吨生铁，有色金属竟无一斤一两。
    新中国一成立，我国第一个大型有色金属采选冶联合企业——白银有色金属公司开始建设，1960年产出电解铜。1960年又开始兴建我国的镍都——金川有色金属公司，1964年产出了镍冶炼产品。紧接着，又有西北铜加工厂、西北铝加工厂、兰州铝厂、兰州连城铝厂、甘肃稀土公司、陇西有色冶金机械厂、甘肃铝厂等一批骨干企业，相继在60年代末到70年代初建成投产。加上陆续建立的设计研究院、矿冶研究院、地质勘探公司和两个建设公司，甘肃省形成了成龙配套的有色金属工业体系。
    1983年，随着有色金属工业管理体制的改革，一批大中型企业划归有色金属总公司直接管理后，甘肃省委、省政府以国家利益为重，提出以有色金属工业为龙头振兴全省经济的一系列设想。1984年，省政府同有色金属工业总公司签订“全面合作，加快发展甘肃有色金属工业”的协议。近年来，在全省严重缺电的情况下，省政府拿出30％多的工业用电来保有色金属总公司所属大中型企业的生产。1988年全省10种有色金属产量达到21.27万吨，居全国第二位，其中，镍、铝产量分别占全国总产量的88.29％和17.49％，居全国第一；实现利税比1983年增长1.14倍，利润和税金均居全国第一。（梁浩泉）
