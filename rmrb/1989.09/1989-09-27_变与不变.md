	“We will break the vicious cycle of stagnation, mistrust, division, tension, and conflict. We will achieve a breakthrough and move towards a completely new South Africa. Continuing to eliminate racial discrimination remains an important goal.” This was stated by South African President F.W. de Klerk in his inaugural address on September 20. From his words, it seems that de Klerk intends to bring about a “completely new” change in the racial issue.

	It is undeniable that since the 73-year-old former President P.W. Botha stepped down and the 53-year-old de Klerk took over as the chairman of the National Party and president, people have indeed seen some changes: de Klerk repeatedly promised to carry out “thorough reforms” in South Africa, allowing the black majority to “share power”; despite the state of emergency not being lifted, restrictions on public protests against racial discrimination have been relaxed; de Klerk also visited black townships and stated that the process of releasing black political prisoners, which has already begun, will continue. In foreign relations, de Klerk has visited Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, and other countries, repeatedly expressing his desire to reconcile with frontline states, improve neighborly relations, and resolve regional issues such as the independence of Namibia and peace in Angola through negotiations.

	Of course, the changes in the South African government are not without reason. The extreme apartheid system has led to social unrest, and social unrest has hindered economic development. Domestically, there is a “vicious cycle of stagnation, mistrust, division, tension, and conflict,” and internationally, it is a genuine “international pariah.” De Klerk is well aware that, under such circumstances, without making some promises and showing some changes, his days will not be easy.

	However, what people see is that while de Klerk promises to give blacks a seat in the central government, he still excludes 26 million blacks from the national elections held on September 6; while he extends an olive branch to neighboring countries, he also repeatedly threatens that “South Africa will not allow neighboring countries to import revolutionary activists,” and “will take necessary actions to strike against terrorists across the border.” In contrast, de Klerk’s so-called “breakthrough,” as Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, is merely “making apartheid policy appear in a new guise.”

	For the South African government, the matter is clear: to alleviate domestic racial conflicts and escape international isolation, the unpopular apartheid system must be completely abandoned. Merely making minor adjustments is ineffective.

    变与不变
    温宪
      “我们将打破停滞、不信任、分裂、紧张和冲突的恶性循环。我们将实现一个突破，走向一个全新的南非，继续消除种族歧视仍然是一个重要的目标”。这是南非新总统德克勒克9月20日在就职演说中说的一番话。听其言，德克勒克似乎想在种族问题上有一个“全新”的改变。
    不可否认，自73岁的前任总统博塔下台，53岁的德克勒克继任国民党主席和总统后，人们的确看到了一些变化：德克勒克不断保证要在南非实行“彻底改革”，让在南非占人口多数的黑人“分享权力”；在“紧急状态”尚未解除的情况下，放宽了对群众抗议种族歧视示威游行的限制；德克勒克还走访了黑人家园，并称已经开始的释放黑人政治犯的进程将继续下去。在对外关系上，德克勒克已先后访问莫桑比克、扎伊尔、赞比亚等国，一再表示要同前线国家和解，搞好睦邻关系，并在纳米比亚独立、安哥拉和平等地区问题上表达了谈判解决问题的愿望。
    当然，南非当局的这个变化并非没有根由。极端的种族隔离制度酿成社会动乱，社会动乱又拖住经济发展的后腿。国内是“停滞、不信任、分裂、紧张和冲突的恶性循环”，在世界上是个道地的“国际孤儿”。德克勒克深知，在此种情势下，不作些许诺和变化的姿态，他的日子不会好过。
    然而，人们看到的是，德克勒克许诺在中央政府中给黑人一席之地的同时，却依然把2600万黑人排除在9月6日举行的全国大选之外；在向邻国摇晃橄榄枝的同时，他又不断扬言“南非不允许邻国向它输入革命活动分子”，“必要时将越境采取行动袭击恐怖分子。”两相对照，德克勒克的所谓“突破”，正如大主教图图所说，不过是“使种族隔离政策以新的面貌出现。”
    对南非当局来说，事情是明摆着的，要想缓解国内种族矛盾和摆脱国际上的孤立境遇，那个不得人心的种族隔离制度，必须彻底放弃，仅仅作点小修小补是无济于事的。
