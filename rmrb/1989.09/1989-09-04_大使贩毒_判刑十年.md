Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, September 2nd.

A former Honduran ambassador to Panama, Roberto Regalado, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by U.S. judicial authorities for smuggling cocaine.

Mexican television reported that this high-ranking diplomat attempted to smuggle 25 pounds of cocaine into the United States by concealing it in his luggage while traveling from Panama to Miami. He believed that his diplomatic status would grant him immunity to bring the drugs into the country. However, he was caught at Miami Airport and subsequently imprisoned.

    大使贩毒  判刑十年
    本报墨西哥城9月2日电  洪都拉斯前驻巴拿马大使罗贝托·雷加拉多因走私可卡因被美国司法当局判处10年徒刑。
    墨西哥电视台报道说，这位高级外交官从巴拿马前往美国迈阿密时，把25磅可卡因用裤子包裹好塞在箱子里，自以为凭着一国使节的身份，可利用外交豁免权把毒品带入美国。想不到在迈阿密机场被查获，锒铛入狱。
