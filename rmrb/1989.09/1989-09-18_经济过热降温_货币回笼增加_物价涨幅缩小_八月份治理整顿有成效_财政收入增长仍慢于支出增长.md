According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in August, the rectification and adjustment work further achieved results. Economic overheating continued to cool down, currency withdrawal increased, and the rate of price increases significantly shrank. However, market sales were sluggish, enterprise benefits did not show clear improvement, and fiscal revenue growth remained slower than expenditure growth.

The structure of industrial production continued to improve. In August, the total industrial output value of the country reached 106.6 billion yuan, an increase of 6.1% compared to the same period last year, with a growth rate 3.5 percentage points lower than the previous month. The over-heated development of township and village enterprises saw their growth rate fall below 10% for the first time. The production of processed products slowed down, while the production of energy and raw materials accelerated. Enterprise economic benefits have not improved. From January to August, the realized profits of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget only increased by 2.5%, and the losses of loss-making enterprises increased by 1.25 times.

Social demand continued to be controlled. By the end of August, the difference between deposits and loans in banks and credit unions decreased by another 7.33 billion yuan compared to the end of July. Banks further controlled their cash expenditures to rural areas, administrative management expenses, and expenditures for urban and rural individual businesses, with growth rates 2 to 4 percentage points lower than in July. In August, the net withdrawal of currency reached 900 million yuan, which is rare in recent years.

Market sales were sluggish. In August, the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide were 63.89 billion yuan, a decrease of 0.7% compared to the same month last year, which is rare in recent years. This is mainly due to the decrease in the sales of consumer goods, especially the decrease in the purchase amount of social groups. Sluggish sales have led to a significant increase in the inventory of social commodities.

The rate of price increases significantly shrank. In August, the price index of living expenses for employees in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by 12.9% compared to the same month last year, with a growth rate 4.2 percentage points lower than the previous month, making it the month with the largest drop this year.

Fiscal revenue growth was slower than expenditure growth. In August, domestic fiscal revenue increased by 9.7% compared to the same month last year, while fiscal expenditure increased by 12%. From January to August, after deducting fiscal revenue and expenditure, the surplus was 2.3 billion yuan less than the same period last year.

　　经济过热降温　货币回笼增加　物价涨幅缩小
　　八月份治理整顿有成效
　　财政收入增长仍慢于支出增长
    新华社北京9月17日电据国家统计局介绍，8月份，治理整顿工作进一步取得成效，经济过热继续降温，货币回笼增加，物价涨幅明显缩小。但市场销售疲软，企业效益无明显好转，财政收入增长仍慢于支出增长。
    工业生产结构继续改善。8月份，全国工业总产值达1066亿元，比去年同期增长6.1％，增幅比上月回落3.5个百分点。过热发展的乡办工业首次出现低于10％的增幅。加工业产品生产放慢，能源、原材料生产加快。企业经济效益仍未好转。1至8月，预算内国营工业企业实现利润仅增长2.5％，亏损企业增亏1.25倍。
    社会需求继续得到控制。8月末，银行、信用社存贷差比7月末又减少73.3亿元。银行对农村现金支出、行政管理费支出和城乡个体经营支出进一步得到控制，增长速度分别比7月份低2至4个百分点。8月份货币净回笼达9亿元，是多年来少有的。
    市场销售疲软。8月份，全国社会商品零售总额638.9亿元，比去年同月下降0.7％，这是近几年少有的。这主要是受消费品销售减少的影响，尤其是社会集团购买额减少。销售疲软已导致社会商品库存大面积上升。
    物价涨幅显著缩小。8月份，35个大中城市职工生活费用价格指数比去年同月上升12.9％，增幅比上月低4.2个百分点，是今年以来回落最大的一个月。
    财政收入增长慢于支出增长。8月份，国内财政收入比去年同月增长9.7％，财政支出增长12％。1至8月，财政收支相抵，结余比去年同期少结余23亿元。
