    110,000 Rural Forest Farms Rise Rapidly
    Forest Land Area Exceeds 100 Million Mu, Annual Sales Revenue Over 1 Billion Yuan

    According to information obtained by reporter Wu Xinghua from the national rural forest farm work conference currently being held in Changsha, since the founding of the People's Republic, China has made tremendous achievements in the construction of rural forest farms. By the end of 1988, there were more than 110,000 rural forest farms nationwide, with 780,000 employees, managing an area of 1.7 billion mu. Among these, 1.3 billion mu are forested, accounting for 16% of the national collective forest land in rural areas. In recent years, the national rural forest farms have produced an average of over 30 million cubic meters of timber annually, with 80 million mu of artificial forestation and young forest cultivation each year. The annual sales revenue from products is over 1 billion yuan, with nearly 400 million yuan from diversified operations, both nearly doubling the figures from 1978.

    Rural forest farms have cultivated a new generation of forests, providing the country with important reserve forest resources. Currently, there are over 1 billion mu of artificial forests in these farms, accounting for one-quarter of the total artificial forestation area preserved since the founding of the People's Republic. The timber volume is over 300 million cubic meters, accounting for 16% of the national collective forest timber volume.

    The timber and forest products produced by these farms have eased the supply-demand contradiction in society. According to incomplete statistics, from the late 1960s to the present, rural forest farms have cumulatively produced nearly 50 million cubic meters of timber, accounting for about 10% of the total rural timber production since the founding of the People's Republic. At the same time, they have provided society with nearly 3 billion yuan worth of fruit and a large quantity of diversified operation products.

    In the development of rural collective forestry, rural forest farms have played a leading and demonstrative role. Currently, rural forest farms in China are responsible for 50% of the seedling supply and 20% of the afforestation tasks in rural areas. The scientific management of appropriate scale operations and cultivation in rural forest farms has generally ensured that planting a patch of trees results in a patch of forest; the growth rate is 30% to 50% higher than that of dispersed operations.

    At present, many rural forest farms have become important pillars of the collective economy. Statistics show that since the founding of the People's Republic, the cumulative sales revenue from products in rural forest farms nationwide has exceeded 7 billion yuan, with several farms achieving an annual per capita output value of over 10,000 yuan and a pure income of over 3,000 yuan.

    11万乡村林场异军突起
    林地面积一亿多亩　年销售收入十亿元
    本报长沙9月24日电　记者吴兴华从正在长沙召开的全国乡村林场工作会议上获悉：建国以来，我国乡村林场建设取得巨大成就。到1988年底，全国已有乡村林场11万多个，从业人员78万人，经营面积1.7亿亩，其中有林地面积1.3亿亩，占全国农村集体林面积的16％。近几年，全国乡村林场平均年产木材300多万立方米，人工造林和中幼林抚育面积均为800多万亩；产品销售年收入10亿多元，其中多种经营收入近4亿元，均比1978年增加近2倍。
    乡村林场营造了一代新林，为国家培育了重要的后备森林资源。乡村林场现有人工林1亿多亩，占建国以来全国人工造林保存面积的1／4，森林蓄积量3亿多立方米，占全国集体林蓄积量的16％。
    这些林场生产的大量木材和林副产品，缓解了社会供求矛盾。据不完全统计，60年代末期至目前乡村林场累计生产木材近5000万立方米，约占建国以来农村木材生产总量的10％左右，同时，还为社会提供了近30亿元的果品和大量的多种经营产品。
    在农村集体林业的发展中，乡村林场发挥了骨干、示范作用。当前，我国乡村林场承担着农村造林50％的苗木供应和20％的造林任务，乡村林场实行适度规模经营、培育管护都比较科学，基本做到栽一片树，成一片林；生长量要比分散经营高30％至50％。
    目前许多乡村林场已成为集体经济的重要支柱。据统计，建国以来，全国乡村林场累计产品销售收入70多亿元，涌现了一批人均年创产值过万元、纯收入3000元以上的林场。
