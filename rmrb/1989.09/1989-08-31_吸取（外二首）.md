	Absorbing (and Two More)
	The endless night seems like a long river, rippling with a vast expanse of dark waves, drifting past countless clouds and stars, countless joys, sorrows, and regrets! I stand alone amidst the waves' crashing, sinking into confusion time and again, like a fish descending to the deep riverbed, absorbing the twisting, clear moonlight!

	Wandering through a spring of bright sunlight and rippling waves, the distant morning bell tolls on the traveler's pillow, shattering the dreams that linger in the darkness. Breathing is hurried yet gentle and sad; the chest heaves with heat and throbs, forever cherishing the trembling starlight of dreams. Among the dew-kissed grass, there is a wistful wandering, exploring the lonely yearning for beauty!

	The wisdom of the mountains and the clouds gather on my chest, the blue waves ripple on my heart, with the fish's composure and the water's clarity, accompanying my shadow standing in the vast expanse. I will remember the wisdom of the mountains, silently enduring the wild winds and sudden rains, the sun and moon passing by my side, leaving not a trace of worry!

    吸取（外二首）
    唐湜漫漫的夜似一道长河，漾着一片黑黝黝的水波，飘过了多少云彩、星星，多少欢乐、悲歌、惭怍！我兀立水波的拍击之中，沉入了一次又一次迷惘，如鱼儿沉落深湛的河底，吸取着曲折澄明的月光！
   涉　行一春的晴光水波样摇漾，远方晨钟在客子的枕上，敲落了幽暗里缭绕的梦，急促的呼吸温柔而哀伤；胸臆起伏灼热而跳荡，永怀着梦中颤栗的星光，草露间有怅然的涉行，探索美的寂寥的渴想！
    山恋的睿智风云在我的胸前凝聚，碧波在我的心上摇漾，有鱼的从容水的澄澈，伴我的身影伫立苍茫；我将记取山峦的睿智，默默地容受风狂雨骤，日月在身边悄悄流过，不留下一点烦忧！
