    China's agricultural science team has reached one million people. Over the 40 years since the founding of New China, our country has established a large agricultural science and technology army of one million people. This agricultural science and technology team has worked diligently under very difficult conditions and made significant contributions to the development of China's agricultural production.

    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there are currently 1,122 agricultural research institutions nationwide, with a total of 130,000 employees. There are more than 200,000 technical promotion institutions nationwide, with 870,000 technical personnel. Among them, there are 25,000 scientific researchers with a university education or above, and 403,000 state technical personnel. The country has established 1,003 county-level agricultural technology promotion centers, initially forming a complete set of research and promotion network systems.

    This team, which has grown from nothing to something and from small to large over the past 40 years, has made outstanding contributions to promoting China's agricultural science and technology progress. Just during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, 45 of the agricultural science and technology breakthroughs achieved international advanced levels, 819 achieved domestic advanced levels, with direct economic benefits amounting to 6.9 billion yuan.
