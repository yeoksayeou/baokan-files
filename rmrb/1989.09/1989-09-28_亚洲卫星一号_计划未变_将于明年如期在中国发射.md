Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 27th.

The transportation and launch plan for "AsiaSat 1" remains unchanged and will be launched as scheduled in China in April 1990. This was stated by the General Manager of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company, Mr. Lo Li Shi, in an interview with reporters in Hong Kong recently.

The launch plan for "AsiaSat 1" was previously affected by the U.S. House of Representatives' decision in June to impose economic sanctions on China, including a ban on the transfer of U.S.-made satellites to China for launch. In response, Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company dispatched senior personnel to the United States to negotiate and prevent the launch plan from being disrupted. Now, the company has confirmed that the satellite launch plan will proceed as scheduled.

    “亚洲卫星一号”计划未变  将于明年如期在中国发射
    据新华社香港9月27日电　“亚洲卫星一号”的运输和发射计划没有变动，将如期于1990年4月在中国发射，这是亚洲卫星通讯有限公司营业经理罗礼士日前在此间向记者表示的。
    “亚洲卫星一号”发射计划曾因美国众议院于今年6月间通过对中国进行经济制裁，包括禁止将美国制造的人造卫星移交中国发射而受影响。为此亚洲卫星通讯有限公司曾派遣高层人员到美国斡旋，防止卫星发射计划受阻。现在，这个公司已证实卫星发射计划将如期进行。
