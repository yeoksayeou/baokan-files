“Everyone should pay attention to oral hygiene and do a good job in preventing dental diseases.” This is the calligraphy by Comrade Deng Yingchao for the first “Love Your Teeth Day” in China on September 20, 1989.

Although the world's first toothbrush was invented in China, although China's toothpaste production capacity is twice the current output, and although the advertising war for toothpaste has been ongoing for a long time, the brushing rate in Chinese cities is only 70%, while in rural areas it is only 20%.

There is no other part of the human body with such a high incidence rate! An authoritative survey shows that more than 700 million people in China suffer from various dental diseases. The average Chinese person has 2.5 decayed teeth (caries); more than 90% of the population suffers from periodontal diseases. Due to the threat of these two diseases, the gap between the average Chinese person's tooth age and lifespan is widening. Many people over the age of 40 have to rely on dentures to maintain their chewing function. With the continuous improvement of living standards, the Chinese people's diet is becoming more refined, and the consumption of sugar is increasing rapidly. The incidence of caries and periodontal diseases will continue to rise year by year. However, at present, China's oral health resources, including manpower, materials, and financial resources, are very limited. The ratio of dentists to the national population is less than 1 to 100,000. If we only focus on treating the existing caries in the country, it would take hundreds of years with the current resources, not to mention the new cases that emerge every year! Therefore, all dentists advise that dental diseases are incurable, and the only way out is to focus on prevention.

Prevention, especially primary prevention, is something everyone can do. The most important and effective way to prevent dental diseases is to brush your teeth twice a day, in the morning and evening, using the correct method. However, in China, improving the national brushing rate requires a tough job of changing people's minds.

What constitutes oral health? The World Health Organization has a definition: “Oral health means a stable, comfortable, and disease-free state, with normal chewing, speaking, and swallowing functions, without affecting participation in necessary social activities. Specific standards include clean teeth, no cavities, no pain, normal gum color, and no bleeding.”

Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said: “The immediate task for the professional team is to focus on prevention projects and key prevention targets, such as the youth population. Because youth is the age group most susceptible to dental diseases, starting from youth to strengthen the cultivation of oral disease prevention and hygiene habits can benefit them for a lifetime. ‘Love Your Teeth Day’ should be held every year, which will greatly promote the improvement of the self-dental health capabilities of the entire population.”

### 写在第一个“爱牙日”

　　写在第一个“爱牙日”
　　本报记者　艾笑
      “人人注意口腔卫生，做好牙病预防工作。”这是邓颖超同志为一九八九年九月二十日中国第一个“爱牙日”的题词。
    尽管世界上第一把牙刷诞生在中国，尽管我国牙膏的生产能力要比目前的产量高一倍，尽管广告上推销牙膏的大战旷日持久，但现今中国城市人口的刷牙率仅为百分之七十，农村人口则不过百分之二十。
    人体中再无别的部位能有如此高的发病率了！一项权威的调查统计表明，全国有七亿多人患有不同的牙病。中国人平均每人有二点五个龋齿（虫牙）；百分之九十以上的国民患有牙周疾病。由于这两种疾病的威胁，中国人的牙龄与寿龄之间的差距越来越大，很多刚过四十岁的人，就不得不依赖假牙维持咀嚼功能。随着物质生活水平的不断提高，我国人民的饮食结构向精细方向发展，加之食糖量增加很快，龋齿和牙周病的发病率还将一年比一年高。而时下我国口腔保健方面的人力、物力、财力都是十分有限的，口腔科医生与全国人口之比不足一比十万。如果只突击治疗全国已发生的龋齿，用现有的力量就需工作几百年，何况还有不断新发的病例呢！所以，所有牙医都告诫人们，牙病是治不胜治的，唯一的出路是立足于防。
    防，尤其初级预防，是人人可以做到的。最重要的有效防范，就是早晚各一次用正确方法刷牙。可是，在中国，提高全民族的刷牙率还要进行艰苦的转变观念的工作。
    怎样才算是口腔健康？世界卫生组织有个规定：“口腔健康意味着稳定、舒适而无疾病，有正常的咀嚼、发音与吞咽功能，不影响其参加应有的社会活动。具体标准是，牙齿清洁、无龋洞、无痛感、齿龈颜色正常、无出血现象。”
    卫生部长陈敏章说：“专业队伍的当务之急是重点抓预防项目，抓重点预防对象，如青少年人群。因为青少年为牙病的易发年龄，从青少年起加强口腔疾病和卫生习惯的培养可使其终身受益。
  ‘爱牙日’要年年搞下去，这将对提高全人口的自我牙健能力是一个大的推动。”
