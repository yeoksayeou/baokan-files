Liaodong Peninsula, like a giant ship, extends from the towering Greater Khingan Range into the ocean, dividing China's northern coastline into the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea. This region, facing Japan and Korea across the Yellow Sea, and backed by the vast and fertile northeastern hinterland, is a crucial link in the Eurasian land bridge. Behind it lies the world-renowned industrial base of Shenyang, as well as the densely clustered industrial cities of Anshan, Fushun, and Liaoyang. On this land that partially encircles the Bohai Sea, mineral resources are abundant, the industrial foundation is strong, and transportation by sea and land is unparalleled nationwide. Along the two wings of the deep-water, expansive Dalian Port, there are port groups such as Yingkou and Dandong. These natural geographical advantages make Liaodong Peninsula the jewel of Liaoning and another golden triangle in China's relatively developed economy.

Under the guidance of a planned economy that emphasized internal circulation, Liaodong Peninsula also experienced a long period of stagnation. In 1984, the state decided to further open Dalian and establish the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone. Subsequently, it approved Yingkou City to enjoy certain preferential policies for coastal open cities. Since then, this region has opened its arms to the world.

To adapt to the needs of opening up, Liaoning Province concentrated its financial resources to first renovate Dalian Port and Yingkou Port, rapidly expanding their cargo handling capacities. The newly built Yingkou Bayuquan Port and Dandong Dandong Port have been opened to the outside world, and ports like Jinzhou are also preparing to receive foreign ships. Following the completion of Dalian Zhouwuzhuang Airport and its international flights, the modernized Shenyang Taoxian Airport, capable of handling large, long-range aircraft, has also been put into use; the two sections of the longest highway in China, from Shenyang to Dalian, have been officially opened to traffic; 210,000 of the 250,000 imported program-controlled telephone lines have been put into use, enabling all 8 cities in the Liaodong Peninsula open area to offer international direct-dial telephone services.

As the overall investment environment gradually becomes more integrated, Liaodong Peninsula has accelerated the construction of 3 pioneering open areas. So far, the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, Yingkou Bayuquan Export Processing Zone, and the comprehensive renovation of Shenyang Tiexi Industrial Zone have all taken shape.

The favorable investment environment has attracted a large number of foreign investment projects. The province has utilized over 600 foreign investment projects, with contract amounts ranking first among all provinces and municipalities nationwide; the development of "three types of enterprises" (joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises) has made significant progress. In the year since opening up, the province has signed "three types of enterprises" contracts equivalent to the total of the previous 9 years. Currently, the province has established 276 "three types of enterprises," achieving a production value of 695 million yuan in the first half of this year and earning 54 million US dollars in export revenue. There have also been breakthroughs in overseas engineering contracting and labor exports. In the first half of this year, 81 engineering contracting contracts were signed, with a contract amount of over 50 million US dollars, and the number of overseas laborers has reached over 5,000. These material foundations have brought about a rapid increase in the province's foreign trade exports. In 1988, the province's foreign trade exports reached a historical high, and in the first half of this year, they increased by 10.1% compared to the same period last year.

    祖国东北的金三角
    辽东半岛，犹如一艘巨舰，从巍巍大兴安岭挺出，直伸大洋，把祖国的北部海疆辟为黄海和渤海。这里，隔黄海东望日本、朝鲜，背靠广阔而富饶的东北腹地，为连接欧亚大陆桥之要冲。她的身后，雄踞着举世瞩目的工业基地沈阳以及鞍山、抚顺、辽阳等世界罕见的密集的工业城市群。在这块半环渤海的土地上，矿产资源丰富，工业基础雄厚，海陆交通运输为全国之冠，在水深港阔的大连港两翼，分布着营口、丹东等港口群。这些得天独厚的地理优势，使辽东半岛成为辽宁的精华，也成为中国经济比较发达的又一个金三角。
    在以内向循环为导向的指令性计划规范下，辽东半岛也渡过漫长的萧条时期。1984年，国家确定进一步开放大连和兴办大连经济技术开发区，接着又批准营口市享有沿海开放城市某些优惠政策，从此，这个地区便向世界袒露了自己的胸怀。
    为了适应开放的需要，辽宁省集中财力，首先对大连港、营口港进行改建，使两个港口迅速扩大了吞吐能力。新建的营口鲅鱼圈港、丹东大东港已对外开放，锦州等港口也将接待外轮。继大连周水子机场建成与世界通航之后，具有现代化水平、可起降大型远程飞机的沈阳桃仙机场也正式启用；我国最长的、沈阳到大连间的高速公路的南北两段已正式通车；从国外引进的25万门程控电话已有21万门投入使用，使整个辽东半岛开放区的8个城市全部开办了国际直达电话业务。
    在总体投资环境逐渐配套成龙的同时，辽东半岛加快了3个开放先行区的建设步伐。到目前为止，大连经济技术开发区、营口鲅鱼圈出口加工区、沈阳铁西工业区总体改造都已初具规模。
    良好的投资环境，引来了大批国外投资项目，全省利用外资已达600多项，合同金额为全国各省市之首；外商投资兴办的“三资企业”取得长足进展。开放一年来，全省签订的“三资企业”合同相当于前9年的总和，目前，全省已开办“三资企业”276家，今年上半年实现产值6.95亿元，出口创汇0.54亿美元。对外工程承包和劳务出口也有了突破性进展，今年上半年，共签订81项工程承包合同，合同金额5000多万美元，在海外劳务人数已达到5000多人。这些物质基础带来了全省外贸出口的迅猛增长。1988年，全省外贸出口创历史最高纪录，今年上半年，又比去年同期增长10.1％。　（杨集才）
