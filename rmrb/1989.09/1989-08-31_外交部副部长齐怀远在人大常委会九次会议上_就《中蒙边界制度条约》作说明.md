Deputy Foreign Minister Qi Huaiyuan, at the plenary session of the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress held this afternoon, explained the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty on behalf of the State Council.

Regarding the necessity of concluding the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty, Qi Huaiyuan said, the Sino-Mongolian border is defined by the 1962 Sino-Mongolian Border Treaty. The 1964 Supplementary Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic on the Sino-Mongolian Border and the 1984 Supplementary Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic on the First Joint Inspection of the Sino-Mongolian Border further delineated the specific course of the border between the two countries. The aforementioned treaties, based on the principles of friendly consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation, resolved the issue of border demarcation between China and Mongolia. However, since there is no established legal framework for the daily management of the shared border and the handling of border affairs, problems arising in border affairs are difficult to resolve promptly and effectively. Therefore, to develop relations between the two countries, maintain the stability of the border, and ensure peace in the border regions, it is necessary to sign a treaty on the border regime and the handling of border affairs between China and Mongolia.

Regarding the process of signing the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty, Qi Huaiyuan said, during the visit of the Mongolian Deputy Foreign Minister to China in 1984, he proposed negotiations for signing a treaty on the border regime and the handling of border affairs between the two countries. In 1985, the Mongolian side raised the issue again. To promote the development of Sino-Mongolian relations, the Chinese side expressed agreement. In March and May 1987, the Chinese delegation and the Mongolian delegation held talks in Beijing and Ulaanbaatar respectively on the treaty regarding the border regime and the handling of border affairs between the two countries. The two sides, in the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, reached an agreement and signed the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty on November 28, 1988.

Regarding the main contents of the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty, Qi Huaiyuan said, the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty is the first treaty signed by China with a neighboring country regarding the border regime and the handling of border affairs. The treaty consists of six parts with a total of 21 articles. The main contents of the six parts are: the course of the border line and the maintenance of border markers, joint border inspections, the use of border waters and transportation facilities, border production activities and the handling of border affairs, and the rights and obligations of border personnel. The Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty not only regulates issues such as production activities in the border regions and the movement of personnel between the two countries, but more importantly, it establishes formal channels for the two countries to handle border affairs, namely the border talks and meetings mechanism and the joint border inspection mechanism. According to the already signed Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty, the governments of China and Mongolia have also signed the Supplementary Agreement to the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty regarding specific matters such as the jurisdiction of border representatives, the locations of meeting points, and the design of certificates used by border personnel. This supplementary agreement will come into effect upon the exchange of ratification documents of the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime Treaty and will constitute a part of the treaty.

He said, the already signed Treaty between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic on the Sino-Mongolian Border Regime and the Handling of Border Affairs is in accordance with the laws of China and international practices, and also meets the actual needs of the two countries for cooperation in handling border affairs.

    外交部副部长齐怀远在人大常委会九次会议上
    就《中蒙边界制度条约》作说明
    新华社北京8月31日电  外交部副部长齐怀远在今天下午举行的七届全国人大常委会第9次会议全体会上，受国务院委托就中蒙边界制度和处理边境问题的条约作了说明。
    关于缔结《中蒙边界制度条约》的必要性，齐怀远说，中蒙两国边界是由1962年《中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国边界条约》规定的。1964年《中华人民共和国政府和蒙古人民共和国政府关于两国边界的议定书》和1984年《中华人民共和国政府和蒙古人民共和国政府关于中蒙边界第一次联合检查的议定书》进一步划定了两国边界线的具体走向。上述条约根据友好协商、互谅互让的原则，解决了中蒙两国边界的划定问题。但是，由于两国共同边界的日常管理和边境事务的处理还没有确立法律制度，边境事务中出现的问题难以及时、有效地得到合理解决。因此，为了发展两国关系，维护两国边界的稳定和边境地区的安宁，有必要就中蒙两国边界制度和处理边境问题的事项签订条约。
    关于《中蒙边界制度条约》的签订经过，齐怀远说，1984年蒙古副外长访华时，向我提出就签署两国边界制度和处理边境问题的条约进行谈判。1985年，蒙方再次提出此事。为促进中蒙两国关系的发展，我方表示同意。1987年3月和
  5月，我方代表团和蒙方代表团先后在北京和乌兰巴托就两国边界制度和处理边境问题的条约进行了会谈。双方本着相互谅解和合作的精神达成了协议，并于1988年11月28日签署了《中蒙边界制度条约》。
    关于《中蒙边界制度条约》的主要内容，齐怀远说，《中蒙边界制度条约》是我国与周边邻国签署的第一个关于边界制度和处理边境问题的条约。该条约分6个部分共21条，6个部分的主要内容是：关于边界线走向和界标的维护、边界联合检查、边界水和交通设施等的利用、边境生产活动和边境事务的处理、边界工作人员的权利和义务。《中蒙边界制度条约》不仅对双方在边境地区的生产活动和双方人员在边境地区的往来等问题作了规定，更为重要的是在制度上确立了两国处理边境事务的正式联系渠道，即边界会谈会晤制度和边界联合检查制度。根据已签署的《中蒙边界制度条约》，中蒙两国政府还就双方边界代表的管辖地段、会晤站地点、边界工作人员使用的证书式样等具体事项签署了《中蒙边界制度条约所附议定书》，该议定书将自《中蒙边界制度条约》的批准书交换之日起生效，构成该条约的组成部分。
    他说，已签署的《中华人民共和国政府和蒙古人民共和国政府关于中蒙边界制度和处理边境问题的条约》符合我国法律规定和国际惯例，也符合两国合作处理边境事务的实际需要。
