In recent years, a series of reform measures for the national defense science and technology system and structural adjustments have been implemented. These measures not only introduced a competitive mechanism into research and production, significantly enhancing the level of weaponry and equipment development, but also achieved a historical shift from a single military product type to a military-civilian integration type, and from a total output structure dominated by military products to one dominated by civilian products. This has allowed more resources to be devoted to supporting national economic construction.

The reform and structural adjustment of the national defense science and technology system have accelerated since 1985. In 1986, a new funding management method for national defense research and development was introduced. This established a new cooperative relationship between the funding departments and the research departments, organically combining responsibilities, rights, and interests, and motivating both parties to improve the efficiency of fund usage. This reform measure realized project management of national defense research and development funds with the goal of achieving research results.

The implementation of contract-based weaponry and equipment development is another significant reform measure in national defense science and technology. In 1987, based on previous pilot reforms, China fully implemented a contract-based system for weaponry and equipment development, transitioning from a planning-based to a contract-based project management system. On this basis, in 1988, various regulations and systems for the contract-based approach were further improved, and the relationship between national plans and contracts was clarified. By the end of the year, the contract signing rate for weaponry and equipment and artificial satellite development projects reached over 90%. In that same year, China's first batch of special equipment for satellites and missiles, procured through bidding, was completed quickly and with high quality, saving 15 million yuan in funds. The Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense also issued regulations for the management of bidding for weaponry and equipment development projects, clarifying that bidding is a competitive method for signing contracts, optimizing the allocation of development tasks, and breaking the pattern of military scientific research and production relying on national subsidies.

Adjusting national defense research and production capabilities to achieve a historical shift towards civilian dominance. Since 1987, the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense has implemented the policy of "military-civilian integration and peace-war integration." It has planned and adjusted the structure of national defense research and production capabilities into three types: primarily military, military-civilian integration, and fully civilian. This has clarified that, except for the core forces retained for military product research and production, a significant portion of research and production capabilities will be shifted towards the development and production of civilian and export products. Through several years of reform, China's national defense science and technology industry has transitioned from solely researching, developing, and producing military products to military-civilian integration and actively developing civilian products, initially achieving a historical shift in the total output structure from military dominance to civilian dominance. Through these transitions and adjustments, a lean, structurally rational national defense science and technology industry team, matching the scale of national defense research and production tasks and investment, has been growing. This not only ensures the realization of the development strategy of the national defense science and technology industry, improves the level of weaponry and equipment development, but also frees up more resources to support national economic construction. On the eve of National Day, Ding Henggao, the Director of the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense, stated in discussing the reform of the national defense science and technology system: "Over the past decade, the national defense science and technology industry has adapted to the large environment of national economic and technological system reforms, followed the overall thinking of developing a planned commodity economy, started from reality, actively explored, and conducted a large amount of adjustment and reform work in guiding ideology, management system, service direction, product structure, and operating mechanism. This has injected new vitality into national defense research and production. Especially the reform of the funding method for national defense research and development, the implementation of a contract-based system under directive planning, and the conscious use of the law of value and introduction of a competitive mechanism have played significant roles in strengthening and improving macro-control, promoting the combination of responsibilities, rights, and interests, motivating the enthusiasm of both the funding and research departments, and improving overall efficiency."

    立足点的历史性转变
    ——国防科技体制改革和结构调整初见成效
    于庆田    
    近几年来，国防科技体制改革和结构调整的一系列整改措施相继出台，不仅把竞争机制引入科研生产，有力地提高了武器装备研制水平，而且使国防科技工业实现了由单一军品型到军民结合型、总产值构成由以军为主到以民为主的历史性转变，从而用更多的力量支援了国家经济建设。
    国防科技体制的改革和结构调整，是1985年以来加快步伐的。1986年，国防科研试制费新的拨款管理办法出台，在使用部门和研制部门之间建立起新的合作关系，使责、权、利有机结合起来，调动起双方的积极性，提高了经费使用效益。这项改革措施，实现了国防科研试制费以研制成果为目标的项目管理。
    武器装备研制实行合同制，是国防科技改革的又一项重要措施。1987年，在以前实行合同制改革试点的基础上，我国武器装备研制全面实行合同制，实现了从以计划为主到通过合同进行项目管理的过渡。在此基础上，1988年继续完善合同制的各种规章制度，理顺国家计划与合同的关系。年底，武器装备和人造卫星研制项目的合同签订率，都达到90％以上。就在这一年，我国首批实行招标订货的用于卫星、导弹的特种装备，速度快质量好地完成了研制任务，并节约经费1500万元。国防科工委还颁布了武器装备研制项目招标管理办法，明确招标是一种具有竞争性质的签订合同的手段，择优安排研制任务，打破了军工科研生产吃国家“大锅饭”的局面。
    调整国防科研生产能力，实现以民为主的历史性转变。1987年以来，国防科工委贯彻“军民结合、平战结合”方针，对国防科研生产能力按照以军为主、军民结合和全部转民三个不同类型统筹规划，进行结构调整，明确了除保留的军品科研生产骨干力量外，相当一部分科研生产能力要转向民品和外贸出口产品的开发与生产。通过几年来的改革，我国的国防科技工业，已由过去单一研究开发生产军品，转移到军民结合、积极开发民品，初步实现了以军为主到以民为主的总产值构成上的历史性转变。通过这些转变和调整，一支与国防科研生产任务和投资规模相适应的、精干的、结构合理的国防科技工业队伍在茁壮成长，不仅保证了国防科技工业发展战略的实现，提高了武器装备研制水平，而且腾出了更多的力量支援国家经济建设。国庆节前夕，国防科工委主任丁衡高中将在谈到国防科技体制改革时指出：“10年来，国防科技工业战线适应国家经济、科技体制改革的大环境，按照发展有计划商品经济的总思路，从实际出发，积极探索，在指导思想、管理体制、服务方向、产品结构、运行机制等方面，进行了大量调整、改革工作，为国防科研、生产注入了新的生机与活力。特别是改革国防科研试制费拨款办法，实行指令性计划下的合同制，并自觉运用价值规律，引入竞争机制，对加强和改善宏观调控，促进责、权、利的结合，调动使用部门与研制部门两个积极性，提高整体效益，都起了显著作用。”
