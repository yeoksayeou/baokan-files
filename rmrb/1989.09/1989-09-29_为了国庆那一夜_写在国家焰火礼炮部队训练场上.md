	For That Night of National Day
	—Written at the National Fireworks and Salute Artillery Team Training Ground

	Beijing's golden autumn, the sky is high and the air is crisp. At the training base of the National Fireworks and Salute Artillery Team in the suburbs of Beijing, commands ring out, cannons roar, and clusters of fireworks rising into the sky make the night sky exceptionally beautiful. Over 1,700 officers and soldiers from the 11th Detachment of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police are here, dedicating their youth and blood to write touching stories for the 40th birthday of the Republic.

	A few days ago, Xu Siliang stepped onto the training ground with a telegram from his girlfriend, who asked him to pick her up. He was excited and couldn't contain his joy. Even after a day of training for more than ten hours, he didn't feel tired. He thought: This time it's great! She's here, let her see our training, see the fireworks we personally launch, and she will understand me.

	However, he didn't expect that his girlfriend came all the way from Boshan, Shandong, to break up with him. Xu Siliang put away his smile, but he wasn't sad. Scenes from the past floated before his eyes: It was last September when Xu Siliang returned to his unit after a leave. Through an introduction, he became friends with that girl. The girl almost wrote him a letter every week, filled with love. Before long, it was time for the old soldiers to retire. The girl saw that her peers already had happy families and wrote to Xu Siliang, asking him to return home and get married early. However, the reply he got was: "The unit needs cadres, and the leader asked me to stay."

	To welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the training became intense, and his girlfriend, not receiving his letters for a week, became angry. Xu Siliang hurriedly explained: "During this period, the unit needs to launch fireworks for National Day, and the training is even more intense. Please understand." Another half month passed, and the girl still didn't see Xu Siliang's letters. In a fit of anger, she returned all six love letters he had written to her and issued an ultimatum: "If you don't come back, we're through..." Seeing the girl's letter, Xu Siliang's eyes blurred. Was this really written by her? He hurriedly wrote a letter to explain to the girl. But before his letter could be sent, the telegram from his girlfriend arrived in Beijing. The platoon leader persuaded her every night, but ultimately couldn't change her mind. The soldiers were indignant for Xu Siliang, but he said calmly: "A forced marriage is not sweet, why force it."

	Two hours ago, Li Zhikuang received an urgent telegram from the battalion commander Zhang Daohai saying "Mother critically ill, return immediately" and had just come down from the training ground.

	Li Zhikuang, this 18-year-old soldier who had only been in the army for six months, was heartbroken. Yes, he really wanted to immediately board the southbound train, even if it was just to see his mother one last time. At this moment, he held the heavy telegram in both hands, his eyes filled with tears: "Mom, rest in peace. I'm doing well in the army. I will definitely listen to your words, shoot the cannons well, and bring honor to the country..." The news of Li Zhikuang's mother passing away from lung cancer quickly reached the command center of the fireworks and salute artillery training. The commander Wang Xingwen and political commissar Wang Guanling immediately decided: No matter how intense the training is, Li Zhikuang must return to take care of his mother's funeral. However, Li Zhikuang, with tears in his eyes, begged the leaders: "Thank you, leaders, for your concern. Right now, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation is approaching. I am a cannon operator. If I leave, it will affect the overall training and the salute artillery launch for National Day. At this critical moment, I want to bring honor to the country and use the completion of my mission to comfort my mother in her grave..." He then bravely endured his sorrow and returned to the cannon position, returning to the battlefield soaked in sweat.

	The salute cannons roar, and the fireworks soar into the sky. Isn't that thunderous salute cannon and those clusters of colorful fireworks the gift that the armed police soldiers present to the Republic on its birthday?

    为了国庆那一夜
    ——写在国家焰火礼炮部队训练场上
    赵宝玉
    北京金秋，天高气爽。京郊南苑国家焰火礼炮部队集训基地，口令声声，炮声隆隆，一簇簇凌空升起的礼花，把夜空装点得分外迷人。武警北京总队11支队的1700余名官兵，为了共和国的40岁生日，他们用自己的青春和热血在这里写下了一个个动人的故事。
    几天前，逯思良是在衣袋里揣着女朋友让他接站的电报走上训练场的，他激动、兴奋之情难以自抑。一天十几个小时的强度训练仍不觉得疲倦，他想：这回可好啦！她来了，好好看看我们的训练，看看由我们亲手施放的礼花，相信她会理解我的。
    然而，他没想到女朋友这次专程从山东博山来是同他“吹灯”的。小逯收起了笑容，但没有悲伤。一幕幕往事又浮现在眼前：那是去年9月份，逯思良探亲归队时，经人介绍同那个姑娘交上了朋友。姑娘几乎每星期都要给小逯写封信，字里行间充满了爱。转眼到老兵退伍的时候了，姑娘看到周围的同龄人早就有了幸福美满的小家庭，便写信给逯思良让他复员回家，早点完婚。然而，得到的回音却是：“部队需要骨干，领导让我留下。”
    为迎接国庆40周年，集训紧张了，他的女朋友一星期收不到他的信就有些生气了。小逯赶忙解释说：“这段时间部队要为国庆节施放焰火，训练更紧了，请你谅解。”又半个多月过去了，姑娘仍不见逯思良的来信，一气之下竟把小逯过去写给他的6封情书全都退了回来。并发出最后通牒：“再不回来，就一刀两断……”看着姑娘的来信，逯思良的眼睛模糊了，这难道是她写的吗？他赶忙写信给姑娘解释。可是，不等他的信寄出，女朋友来京的电报已送到了他的手中。指导员每天晚上苦口婆心地规劝，但最终也没能打动姑娘的心。战士们为小逯打抱不平，可他却坦然地说：“强扭的瓜不甜，何必强求。”
    两小时前，李志宽是从大队长张道海的手里接过一封“母病故速归”的加急电报，刚走下训练场的。
    李志宽，这个年仅18岁刚刚入伍6个月的新战士，他的心碎了。是啊，他多么想立刻就踏上南去的列车，哪怕最后再见母亲一面。此刻，他双手捧着这封沉重的电报，眼里含满了泪花：“妈妈，您就放心地去吧，儿在部队挺好的，我一定听您的话，打好礼炮，为国争光……”李志宽母亲患肺癌不幸病逝的消息，很快传到了焰火、礼炮集训总指挥部，支队长王兴文、政委王冠岭立即做出决定：训练再紧张，也要让李志宽回去料理他母亲的后事。然而，李志宽却含着泪向领导恳求说：“谢谢首长对我的关心，眼下国庆40周年就要到了，我是一名炮手，我一走就会影响整体训练，给国庆鸣放礼炮带来影响。在这关键时刻，我要为祖国争光，用完成好任务的实际行动来告慰九泉之下的母亲……”他又强忍着悲痛走上了炮位，走上了那洒满汗水的演兵场。
    礼炮齐鸣，焰火凌空。那一声声春雷般的礼炮，那一簇簇缤纷的礼花，不正是武警战士献给共和国生日的礼物吗？
