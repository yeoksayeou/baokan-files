China's civil aviation industry, which is the same age as the People's Republic, has accompanied the steps of New China over the past 40 years of development.

In its early days, China's civil aviation had only 12 routes. By the end of 1988, this number had grown to 350 routes, an increase of 338 routes. The domestic air transport network connecting major cities and tourist and open cities is extensive, with international and Hong Kong routes increasing from the original 3 to 48.

In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, civil aviation had only a dozen or so old small aircraft. By the end of 1988, China's civil aviation had 170 aircraft of various types, most of which are relatively advanced models internationally. By the end of 1988, China's civil aviation completed a total transportation turnover of 2.3 billion ton-kilometers, transporting 14.42 million passengers and 328,000 tons of cargo and mail, which are 1,465 times, 1,386 times, and 428 times the figures for 1950, respectively.

Over the past 40 years, the basic facilities of civil aviation have been continuously updated and renovated. Nearly 80 airports have been newly built and expanded nationwide over 40 years. Currently, civil aviation uses 93 transport airports, of which 47 can accommodate Boeing 737 aircraft.

Although China's civil aviation industry has developed rapidly over the past 40 years, it is still far from meeting objective needs. The active domestic economy, strengthened horizontal ties, increased external exchanges, and the development of the tourism industry all require civil aviation to develop further.

### 中国民航走向世界　航空运输四通八达　机型设施不断更新

　　中国民航走向世界
　　航空运输四通八达
　　机型设施不断更新
    据新华社北京9月16日电　（记者李玫、杨理科）与共和国同龄的中国民用航空事业，伴随着新中国的脚步，走过了她40年的发展历程。
    创建初期只有12条航线的中国民航，到1988年底，航线发展到350条，增长了338条。连接国内各大中心城市和旅游、开放城市的国内航空运输网四通八达，通往国际和香港地区的航线由当初的3条增加到48条。
    建国初期，民航仅有十几架陈旧的小飞机，到1988年底，我国民航已拥有各类运输飞机170架，其中大部分都是国际上较先进的机型。1988年底，我国民航完成运输总周转量23亿吨公里，旅客运输量1442万人、货邮运输量32.8万吨，分别为1950年的1465倍、1386倍和428倍。
    40年来，民航的基础设施不断得到更新改造。全国40年新建和改扩建机场近80个。目前，民航使用的运输航班机场93个，其中可起降波音737飞机的机场有47个。
    40年的中国民航事业虽然发展较快，但远不能满足客观需求。国内经济的活跃，横向联系的加强，对外交往的增多，以及旅游事业的发展，需要民航有个更大的发展。
