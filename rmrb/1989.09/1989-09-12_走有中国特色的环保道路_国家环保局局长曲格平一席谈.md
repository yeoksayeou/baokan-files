On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, Qu Ge Ping, reviewed the development of China's environmental protection industry and felt that the socialist system is the fundamental guarantee for the achievements of China's environmental protection industry.

Reporter: To make environmental protection a fundamental policy is a sign of our country's maturity.

Qu Ge Ping: Yes. This decision of ours fully reflects the superiority of the socialist system and fully reflects the fundamental purpose of our Party and our country to "serve the people." Many foreign friends cannot imagine that our country, with a per capita GDP of around $300, can decide to spend 7 billion yuan annually on environmental protection.

Reporter: Environmental protection is a hot topic worldwide and has attracted the attention of all countries.

Qu: We must keep up with the global trend in our understanding and actions on environmental protection. However, it is important to note that while learning from foreign experiences is important, exploring and pioneering a path of environmental protection with Chinese characteristics is even more important.

Reporter: What is the path of environmental protection with Chinese characteristics? What beneficial explorations have we made?

Qu: The so-called path of environmental protection with Chinese characteristics is to determine the work guidelines and policies according to our own actual situation. We cannot follow the path of first pollution and then treatment taken by Western countries, nor can we sacrifice the environment for the accumulation of profits as they once did. The socialist system determines that we must take more measures to promote the coordinated development of economy, society, and environment. Although China's current economic development is still backward, the management level and technological level are relatively low, the legal system is being improved, and there are many debts in environmental pollution and ecological destruction, there are also many unfavorable factors in environmental construction, but there is also a huge potential for latecomers. For example, the total amount of resources is abundant, people have a strong desire for reform and opening up, and the public's environmental awareness is increasing. In view of this national condition, in the process of exploring the path of environmental protection with characteristics in recent years, we have at least made the following explorations in several aspects: First, we have established environmental protection as a fundamental policy, formulated the guiding principle of planning, implementing, and developing economic construction, urban and rural construction, and environmental construction simultaneously, and made appropriate arrangements in the national economic plan and social development plan; Second, we have established the three major policies of "prevention first," "who pollutes, who treats," and "strengthening environmental management," and gradually formed an environmental policy system with strengthening environmental management as the main body; Third, we have initially established a unified leadership and division of labor and cooperation environmental protection management system.

Reporter: This can be said to be a Chinese-style environmental management concept. What are the similarities and differences between this concept and that of Western industrialized countries?

Qu: An important aspect is that China's current environmental protection work focuses on strengthening management, while Western countries rely on "enforcement plus investment." "Enforcement" refers to the mandatory implementation of various regulations, and punishment for violations; "investment" refers to the adoption of high-input and new technology measures to prevent and control pollution, with costs generally accounting for 2% of the gross national product. China's current investment in pollution prevention and control is much less than that of developed countries, accounting for only 0.5% of the gross national product. Obviously, it is not feasible to copy foreign experience, so it is necessary to explore a set of environmental management concepts that suit the national conditions, and strengthening environmental management is an important part of this concept.

Reporter: What are the main contents of strengthening environmental management?

Qu: Currently, the main contents are: First, to formulate necessary regulations and policies to provide behavioral norms for all sectors; Second, to continuously improve the environmental management system of unified leadership and division of labor and cooperation; Third, to establish a powerful environmental management organization and to supervise and manage strictly according to regulations and policies; Fourth, to carry out extensive publicity and education to continuously improve the environmental awareness of the whole nation.

Reporter: This means that environmental protection should be truly transformed into a national cause.

Qu: This is a leap in cognition. This leap has gone through two stages of development. The first stage began with the First National Environmental Protection Conference in 1973. Although the tasks of the environmental management department were summarized as "overall planning, comprehensive arrangement, organization and implementation, and inspection and supervision" at this conference, due to the lack of clarity on how to play the role of "overall planning" and "inspection and supervision" in actual work, little effort was made in these aspects, and the focus was on "organization and implementation."

Reporter: It is said that at that time, environmental pollution was developing seriously, and the focus of environmental management was on organizing the treatment of environmental pollution, which was also a situation at that time. However, this approach has a drawback: if the enterprises and units that discharge pollutants lack the initiative to treat them, they tend to push the responsibility to the government and society, leading to a situation where environmental pollution is difficult to prevent.

Qu: Based on this understanding, the "who pollutes, who treats" policy was stipulated in the "Environmental Protection Law" promulgated in 1979, clarifying the responsibility. This thought evolution process took 9 years. The second stage of cognition is from the establishment of the Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection in 1982 to the present.

Reporter: This stage has also been 8 years. What problems have been solved in this period?

Qu: In summary, there are two aspects: "what to manage" and "how to manage." In 1984, at the Second National Environmental Protection Conference, the guiding principle of "three simultaneous" for economic, urban and rural, and environmental construction was formulated, and the three major environmental policy systems with strengthening management as the main body were proposed. The basic spirit is to guide the original single treatment to the track of prevention first and prevention and treatment combination, solving the problem of "what to manage"; The five systems proposed at the Third National Environmental Protection Conference this April, namely, the environmental protection target responsibility system, the quantitative assessment system for comprehensive treatment of urban environment, the pollution discharge permit system, the limited period treatment of pollution, and the promotion of centralized control, are new developments in strengthening environmental management, solving the problem of "how to manage." Solving the problems of "what to manage" and "how to manage" is an important sign of the development of China's environmental management thought to a certain stage.

Reporter: The quality of the environment of a country is directly related to the development of the country's economy, the stability of society, and the quality of people's living conditions. Although there is still a gap between China and economically developed countries in environmental protection, looking back at the development history of the national environmental protection industry, a set of Chinese-style environmental management concepts has been formed in just 16 years, and a path of environmental protection that suits the national conditions has been explored and pioneered, which is worth celebrating.

Qu: With the improvement of management concepts, it can be believed that China's environmental protection industry will advance along the socialist path to victory, and environmental management and environmental construction will have greater development.

　　走有中国特色的环保道路
　　——国家环保局局长曲格平一席谈
　　本报记者　谢联辉
    中华人民共和国成立40周年前夕，国家环保局局长曲格平回顾了我国环境保护事业的发展历程，深感社会主义制度是我国环保事业取得成绩的根本保证。
    记者：把环境保护作为基本国策，这是我们共和国成熟的表现。
    曲格平：是的。我国的这一决策，充分体现了社会主义制度的优越性，充分体现了我们党、我们国家
  “为人民服务”的基本宗旨。很多外国朋友不敢想象，我国在人均国民生产总值300来美元的情况下，能下决心每年拿出70亿元用于环境保护。
    记者：环保是世界热门话题，已经引起各国重视。
    曲：我们对环保的认识和行动，要跟上世界潮流。但必须注意，借鉴国外经验重要，探索和开拓一条具有我们中国特色的环保道路更重要。
    记者：什么是有中国特色的环保道路？我们作了哪些有益的探索？
    曲：所谓中国特色的环境保护道路，就是根据自己的实际情况确定工作方针和政策。我们不能走西方国家先污染后治理的道路，不能像他们曾做过的那样为积累利润而牺牲人们生存的环境。社会主义制度决定我们要采取更多措施推动经济、社会和环境协调发展。虽然我国目前经济发展还落后，管理水平和科技水平还较低，法制正在健全，环境污染和生态破坏方面欠账较多，在环境建设方面有许多不利因素，但也有巨大的后发潜力。比如，资源总量雄厚，人们改革开放愿望强烈，群众环境意识在增强等。针对这种国情，我们这些年在开拓有特色的环保道路过程中，至少做了这几方面的探索：一，确定了环境保护是一项基本国策，制定了经济建设、城乡建设和环境建设同步规划、同步实施、同步发展的指导方针，并在国民经济计划、社会发展计划中作了适当安排；二，确立了“预防为主”、“谁污染谁治理”和“强化环境管理”三大政策，逐步形成以强化环境管理为主体的环境政策体系；三，初步建立起一个统一领导、分工协作的环境保护管理体制。
    记者：这可以说是中国式的环境管理思路。这种思路与西方工业发达国家的有什么异同？
    曲：其中一个重要方面，是我国当前环保工作以强化管理为中心，而西方国家则是依靠“强制加投入”。“强制”是指强行贯彻各项法规，违法的要制裁；“投入”是指采取高投入、新技术措施防治污染，其费用一般占国民生产总值的2％。我国目前防治污染建设投入与发达国家相比少得多，仅占国民生产总值的0.5％，无疑，照搬国外经验行不通，所以必须摸索一套符合国情的环境管理思路，强化环境管理就是这个思路的重要组成部分。
    记者：强化环境管理主要包括哪些内容？
    曲：就当前来说，一是制定必要的法规和政策，为各行各业提供行为准则；二是不断完善在统一领导下的分工协作的环境管理体制；三是建立强有力的环境管理机构，切实按法规和政策进行监督管理；四是广泛开展宣传教育，不断提高全民族的环境意识。
    记者：这就是说，要真正把环境保护变成一项全民的事业。
    曲：这是认识上的飞跃。这个飞跃经历了两个发展阶段。第一阶段从1973年第一次全国环保会议开始。在这次会议上虽然把环境管理部门的任务概括为“统筹规划，全面安排，组织实施，检查督促”，但在实际工作中，由于对如何发挥“统筹规划”、“检查督促”职能不明确，很少在这些方面下功夫，而把精力放在“组织实施”上。
    记者：据说那时的环境污染正在严重发展，把环境管理的重点放在组织环境污染治理上，也是当时的情况所逼。不过这样做有个弊病，如果排放污染物的企业、单位缺乏治理积极性，容易把责任推给政府和社会，导致环境污染防不胜防的局面。
    曲：基于这种认识，在1979年颁布的《环境保护法》中规定“谁污染谁治理”的政策，明确了责任。这种思想演变过程用了9年时间。第二阶段认识是从1982年城乡建设环境保护部成立到现在。
    记者：这一阶段算起来也有8年时间了。在这一时期解决了哪些问题？
    曲：概括起来，一是“管什么”，二是“怎么管”。1984年在第二次全国环保会议上，制定了经济、城乡、环境建设“三同步”指导方针，提出了以强化管理为主体的三大环境政策体系，其基本精神是把原来的单纯治理引导到以防为主、防治结合的轨道上来，解决“管什么”的问题；今年4月第三次全国环保会议提出的五项制度，即环境保护目标责任制、城市环境综合整治定量考核制、排放污染物许可证制度、污染限期治理、推进集中控制，是强化环境管理的新发展，解决“怎么管”的问题。解决“管什么”、“怎么管”的问题，是我国环境管理思想演变发展到一定阶段的重要标志。
    记者：一个国家的环境质量好坏，直接关系到这个国家经济的发展、社会的安定、人们生存条件的优劣。尽管我国在环保方面与经济发达国家相比还有差距，但回眸国家环保事业发展历程，在短短16年间就形成了一套中国式的环境管理思想，探索和开拓出一条符合国情的环保道路，值得庆贺。
    曲：随着管理思想的完善，可以相信，我国环境保护事业将沿着社会主义道路胜利前进，环境管理、环境建设将会有更大的发展。
