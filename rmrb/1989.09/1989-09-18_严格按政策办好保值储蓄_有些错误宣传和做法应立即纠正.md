According to a report by Zhang Jidong of the Financial Times, a spokesperson from the People's Bank of China stated this afternoon in Beijing that since the State Council decided to offer long-term value-preserving savings, bank savings deposits have been steadily increasing. All specialized banks must continue to manage long-term value-preserving savings and various other savings schemes to stabilize the financial market and protect the interests of depositors.

The spokesperson said that banks offering value-preserving savings is a major measure taken by the State Council in response to the significant increase in prices in China last year. The goal is to protect the interests of the people and stabilize savings deposits. The State Council has determined that for 3-year, 5-year, and 8-year term deposits, upon maturity and repayment of principal and interest, the bank will compensate for the portion of price increases during the deposit period that exceeds the same period's bank interest rate. If the price increase during the deposit period is lower than the bank's savings interest rate, there is no need for value-preservation compensation.

The spokesperson said that recently, some places have engaged in promotions that do not comply with national regulations on value-preserving savings, leading to public misunderstanding and misinformation. Some places have even calculated the future returns of value-preserving savings based on the current announced compensation rates and bank interest rates, giving the public the false impression that the principal and interest upon maturity can increase by tens or even hundreds of times. He emphasized that currently, efforts to curb inflation are showing initial results, and the rate of price increases has begun to slow. Under these circumstances, using the current compensation rates to predict and calculate the future deposit returns over several years is obviously unscientific, and such promotions and practices are incorrect.

The spokesperson said that value-preserving savings are not necessarily better the longer the term. He stated that the People's Bank of China has recently required local financial institutions to strictly follow the current national policies to manage value-preserving savings and various other savings schemes. At the same time, they should proceed from the perspective of protecting the interests of depositors and the bank's reputation to conduct realistic promotions. The current maximum term for fixed-term deposits and value-preservation is eight years, and all banks are strictly prohibited from arbitrarily extending the term of fixed-term deposits and value-preservation. For the few cases that violate national regulations and arbitrarily handle the automatic rollover of value-preserving savings upon maturity, corrections must be made immediately.

### 严格按政策办好保值储蓄　有些错误宣传和做法应立即纠正

　　严格按政策办好保值储蓄
　　有些错误宣传和做法应立即纠正
    新华社北京9月16日电　据金融时报记者张继东报道：中国人民银行总行新闻发言人今天下午在此间指出，国务院决定开办长期保值储蓄以来，银行储蓄存款不断上升。各专业银行一定要继续办好长期保值储蓄和各种储蓄，为稳定金融市场、维护储户利益服务。
    这位发言人说，银行开办保值储蓄是在去年我国物价上涨幅度较大的情况下，国务院为保护人民群众利益、稳定储蓄存款而采取的一项重大措施。国务院确定我国开办保值储蓄给予保值贴补的原则是，对3年、5年、8年期的定期储蓄存款，在到期还本付息时，银行对存款期间物价上涨幅度高于同期银行利率的部分，给予贴补。如果存款期间物价上涨幅度低于银行的储蓄利率，就不存在保值补贴的问题了。
    这位发言人说，近一时期，一些地方出现了并不符合国家保值储蓄规定的错误宣传，造成群众误信和误解。个别地方甚至按现在公布的当前的贴补率和银行利率，计算出保值储蓄在几十年以后的收益，使群众产生存款到期时本息可以翻十几倍甚至几十倍的错觉。他强调，当前抑制通货膨胀初见成效，物价涨势已开始减缓。在这种情况下，用现在的保值贴补率预测和计算今后若干年的存款收益额，显然是不科学的，这样的宣传和作法也是错误的。
    这位发言人说，保值储蓄并不是时间越长越好。他表示，中国人民银行总行最近已要求各地金融机构严格按照国家现行政策，办好保值储蓄和各种储蓄，同时，要从维护储户利益和银行信誉出发，实事求是地进行宣传。现行定期存款和保值的最长年限是八年，各银行一律不准擅自延长定期存款和保值年限，对于少数违反国家规定擅自办理保值储蓄到期自动转存的，必须立即纠正。
