Today morning, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen paid a visit to Salim Ahmed Salim, congratulating him on his election as the President of the UN General Assembly.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen emphasized during his meeting with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the key to resolving the Cambodian issue at present is to establish a transitional government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

It is reported that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in his talks with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker in New York on September 28 that China hopes the U.S. side will take some practical steps to improve Sino-U.S. relations.

Foreign Minister Qian stressed that China attaches importance to Sino-U.S. relations, but the restoration and development of relations between the two countries require efforts from both sides. Qian pointed out that China will continue to implement its policy of opening up to the outside world. However, the current problem is that the other side has closed the door.

Secretary of State Baker expressed that the United States also attaches importance to relations with China and is willing to work for strengthening relations between the two countries.

Both sides also frankly exchanged views on the Cambodian issue and some specific issues in Sino-U.S. bilateral relations.

It is reported that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens at the UN headquarters on September 28. He said that the overall international situation has shown a trend of easing, and all parties in the Middle East should follow the historical trend, start from reality, and achieve reconciliation.

Foreign Minister Qian also said that China and Israel can conduct some civilian exchanges.
