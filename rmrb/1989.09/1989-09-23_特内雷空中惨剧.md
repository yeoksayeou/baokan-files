In the afternoon of September 19, a DC-10 aircraft operated by French UTA (Union des Transports Aériens) on Flight 772, en route from Brazzaville to Paris, lost contact with the ground after stopping in N'Djamena. Was it a communication failure, or had it been hijacked? People anxiously speculated about its whereabouts.

Relatives waiting at Paris's Orly Airport were informed the next day that the plane had exploded 20 minutes after taking off from the Chadian capital, killing all on board.

The scene was horrifying: the wing was stuck in a sand dune, the cockpit was 10 kilometers away, thousands of charred airplane fragments were scattered around, and passengers still strapped to their seats were found dead.

The French public was shocked by this air disaster. After analyzing the accident site and various clues, relevant departments and the airline concluded that this was a deliberate sabotage. UTA President Jacques Lopert told reporters that the plane was in good condition and that there was no possibility of a mechanical failure. In any emergency, the pilot would have had time to contact the ground. Furthermore, the plane wreckage was scattered over an area of several square kilometers, not in a linear pattern, indicating that the plane had exploded in mid-air. It is said that U.S. military satellites also detected this abnormal situation.

After the accident, French troops in Chad immediately dispatched a rescue team, including four helicopters, and the security department sent an investigation team to look for nine mysterious passengers who had disembarked earlier in N'Djamena.

Some French newspapers suggested that although no one has claimed responsibility for this sabotage, France's policies in the Middle East and Africa have many grievances, and it is likely the work of some terrorist organizations. On March 12, 1984, a DC-8 aircraft of the same airline on the same route exploded at N'Djamena Airport. After France sent warships to Lebanon last month, the intelligence and security departments have been receiving threat warnings. People are concerned that this bombing incident may be a precursor to a series of terrorist activities targeting France as seen in previous years.

For the French public, they are increasingly worried about the safety of civil aviation. They say, "The common people are innocent. Why bomb civilian aircraft?"

It is reported that the black box from the DC-10 aircraft has been found in the desert. After studying it, the mystery of this accident will be finally revealed. (Reported from Paris on September 22)

    特内雷空中惨剧
    本报记者　吕网大
    9月19日下午，一架法国联合航空公司执行772航班的DC—10型客机，由布拉柴维尔飞往巴黎途中在恩贾梅纳作停留后续飞，突然与地面失去联系。是通讯故障，还是被劫持……人们焦急不安地猜测它的下落。
    在巴黎华西机场等待了一夜的亲友，第二天才被告知，这架飞机从乍得首都起飞20分钟后即在尼日尔的特内雷大沙漠上空爆炸，机上人员全部遇难。
    现场惨不忍睹：机翼插在沙堆里，10公里外是驾驶舱，成千被烧焦的飞机碎片散落在四周，身系安全带的旅客仍连着座椅，但他们都死了。
    法国公众为这一空难事件震惊。有关部门和航空公司分析了事故现场及种种迹象后，认为这是一起人为的破坏事件。联合航空公司总裁拉波特在接受记者采访时认为，飞机状况良好，不可能是机械事件，在任何紧急情况下，驾驶员都有时间与地面联系。此外，飞机残骸散落在方圆十几平方公里，不是呈条状分布，说明飞机是在飞行中突然爆炸坠毁的。据说美国军事卫星当时也测到了这一异常情况。
    事故发生后，法国驻乍得部队立即派出包括四架直升机在内的救援部队，安全部门也派出调查组，并在恩贾梅纳寻找9名先期下飞机的神秘旅客。
    法国有的报刊认为，这次破坏活动虽然还没有人声明是谁干的，但法国的中东和非洲政策积怨不少，很可能是某些恐怖组织搞的。1984年3月12日，正是这家航空公司的同一航线上，一架DC—8型客机在恩贾梅纳机场爆炸。法国在上月派出军舰去黎巴嫩后，情报安全部门也不断接到威胁警告。人们担心这次炸机事件是否会像前几年出现一系列针对法国的恐怖活动的先兆。
    对法国公众来说，他们越来越为民航的安全担忧。他们说，老百姓是无辜的，为什么要炸民航客机呢。
    据悉，DC—10型飞机上的黑匣子今天已在沙漠中找到，经研究后将最终揭开这次事故之谜。（本报巴黎9月22日电）
