The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew was born on October 30, 1946, at the Harbin Locomotive Depot. Over the past 40-plus years, whether during the tumultuous times of war or the periods of socialist construction, they have been renowned nationwide for their efforts in pulling more, running faster, and ensuring safety and punctuality. They are a red flag on the front lines of China's railway transportation.

By August 1989, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew had set a national record for freight locomotive safe operation, covering over 5.13 million kilometers. They have saved more than 12,000 tons of coal, over 770 tons of fuel, and over 94,500 yuan in oil and grease materials. They have also transported an additional 205 tons of goods.

This locomotive crew has passed down and upheld the fine traditions of hard work and thrift, making it a family heirloom. Since its establishment, the crew has had eight different crew leaders, seven of whom have gone on to hold various leadership positions.

They have studied technology, honed their skills, focused on increasing production and saving resources, and strictly managed their crew. With a strong sense of ownership and responsibility, they have continuously innovated and summarized the "Standardized Operation for a Single Shift" work method, which has been promoted throughout the railway system.

　　毛泽东号机车组小史
    “毛泽东号”机车组于1946年10月30日诞生于哈尔滨机务段。40多年来，无论是在战火纷飞的年代，还是在社会主义建设时期，他们以多拉快跑，安全正点闻名全国，是我国铁路运输战线上的一面红旗。到1989年8月，“毛泽东号”机车组创造了我国铁路货运机车安全行车513万多公里的最高记录，节约煤炭12000多吨，节约燃油770多吨，节约油脂材料费94500多元，多拉货物205多吨。
    这个机车组把艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的优良传统，接过来，传下去，成为机车组的传家宝。机车组成立以来已经换了八任司机长，其中已有七任走上了各级领导岗位。
    他们学习技术，苦练过硬本领，立足增产节约，严格班组管理，以高度的主人翁责任感，不断创新，总结出《一次出乘作业标准化》工作方法，并在全路推广。
