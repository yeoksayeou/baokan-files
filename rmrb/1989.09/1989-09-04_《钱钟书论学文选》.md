The renowned scholar Qian Zhongshu of our country has works that bridge the gap between Chinese and Western cultures and integrate ancient and modern knowledge, attracting the attention of the academic and cultural circles both at home and abroad. To provide a popular selection for a wide range of readers, the editorial department of "Random Notes" at Hua Cheng Publishing House has compiled and published this selection of works.

This "Selected Works" includes Qian Zhongshu's scholarly essays from "Guanzhui Bian," "Discussions on Art," "Seven Pieces," and "Selected and Annotated Songs of the Song Dynasty," excluding his novels and poems. It also includes all of his recent scholarly manuscripts from the past seven years. The editors have chosen to organize the works by thematic categories, dividing them into five main sections: Speculation, Human Affairs, Creation, Appreciation, and Literary Criticism. Each section further includes various subtopics and conditions, totaling six volumes with approximately 1.8 million characters.
