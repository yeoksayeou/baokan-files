We enthusiastically recommend to our readers the article "The True Colors of a Communist."

The report introduces some domestic affairs of Communist Party member and revolutionary veteran Zeng Zhi—her diet, living arrangements, and household furnishings, as well as the relationship between this old revolutionary and the people. Though these matters are small, they shine brightly. They reflect, from one angle, the noble character, integrity, and aspirations of an old Communist Party member.

Our reports on how high-ranking cadres of our Party and those revolutionary veterans who have made great contributions to the Chinese revolution live, work, and study are few. Perhaps some people have misunderstandings, thinking that their food, clothing, housing, and daily necessities must be luxurious and extravagant, far beyond what ordinary people can afford. The reality is not like this. The vast majority of them live modestly. As Comrade Zeng Zhi has said: "There are many old comrades like me." Some people have misunderstandings mainly because they do not know the facts. Are there some leaders who are detached from the masses, high above them, living in luxury and indulging in a corrupt lifestyle? Certainly, there are. But, as a whole, the Chinese Communist Party, which is in power, and its various levels of cadres are fundamentally different from the old-style bureaucrats. The vast majority of them are selfless, incorruptible, and serve the people wholeheartedly. In Chinese history, our Party and government are the most incorruptible so far. This has been proven by countless facts.

Comrade Zeng Zhi is an old comrade who has made contributions to the Chinese revolution and construction. She completely has the right to enjoy better treatment in her life, but she lives a modest life. When she goes to the grassroots level, local comrades show her high respect, which makes her uncomfortable. The reason for this is that she always holds herself to the standard of a Communist Party member, does not seek credit, is not arrogant, puts herself forward in hardships, and puts herself last in enjoyment, taking serving the people wholeheartedly as her lifelong pursuit. There are many old comrades like Comrade Zeng Zhi in our Party. Compared with these old comrades, those who have not made great contributions but act as if they have; those who have not made great contributions but demand high treatment; those who are not high-ranking but act as if they are, should feel ashamed. In these aspects, middle-aged and young cadres should learn from the old comrades.

Comrade Zeng Zhi has left her post, but she still sets a high moral example for later generations with her noble character. Her noble character is a good teaching material for revolutionary tradition education, a precious spiritual wealth, worth serious study, and should be carried forward.

### 多么可敬的老前辈

    多么可敬的老前辈
    我们热切向读者推荐《共产党人的本色》一文。
    报道介绍的是共产党员、革命老前辈曾志的一些家事——饮食起居、家庭陈设以及这位革命老人同人民群众之间的关系。事情虽小，但熠熠生辉。它从一个侧面反映了一位老共产党员高尚的品格、情操和追求。
    我们党的高级干部们以及那些为中国革命贡献甚大的革命老前辈们是怎样生活、工作和学习的，这方面我们报道的不多。也许有些人对此有些误解，以为他们吃的、穿的、住的、用的，一定很豪华、很阔气，远非普通群众可比。实情并不是这样。他们中的绝大多数人的生活是简朴的。正如曾志同志所说：“像我这样的老同志很多都是这样的。”一些群众对此有误解，主要是因为不了解情况。个别脱离群众、高高在上、养尊处优、生活腐化的领导干部有没有呢？肯定有。但从整体上讲，作为执政的中国共产党及其各级领导干部和旧式官僚有着根本的区别。他们中的绝大多数人是不谋私利、廉洁奉公、全心全意为人民群众服务的。在中国历史上，我们的党和政府是迄今为止最廉洁的。这是许许多多事实证明了的。
    曾志同志是对中国革命和建设事业有功的老前辈，完全有理由在生活上享受更好的待遇，但她却过着简朴的生活。到下面去，地方的同志给这位老前辈以较高的礼遇，这使她不安。之所以这样，是因为她始终以一个共产党员的标准严格要求自己，不居功，不自傲，吃苦在前，享受在后，把全心全意为人民服务当作自己的毕生追求。像曾志这样的老同志在我们党内是很多的。和这些老同志相比，那些功劳不大，谱摆得不小；贡献不大，待遇要得不少；“官”不大，架子端得很大的人，应该感到惭愧。在这些方面，中青年干部要向老同志学习。
    曾志同志已经离开了工作岗位，但她仍以自己的高风亮节垂范于后人。她的高尚品德是一份进行革命传统教育的好教材，是一笔宝贵的精神财富，值得认真学习，并使之发扬光大。
