Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 3rd.

The nationwide inspection of taxes, finance, and prices for 1989 officially began. Wang Bingqian, a member of the State Council and Minister of Finance, stated at the national inspection work conference held today that this year's inspection is a major measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and an important means to achieve the three-year rectification and adjustment goals. Local party and government leaders must treat the inspection as a major task and resolutely ensure its success.

From 1985 to 1988, China conducted four consecutive major inspections, uncovering a total of 44.02 billion yuan in violations, of which 28.05 billion yuan was remitted to the treasury. Wang Bingqian believes that these years of inspections have achieved significant results, but there are also some issues that need improvement. He pointed out that a prominent problem is that the handling of discovered violations has been too lenient, which is a major reason for the recurring violations and the increasing trend of illegal and disorderly behavior. Therefore, this year's inspection must emphasize the word "strict"—strict requirements, strict discipline, and serious handling. At the same time, the word "deep" must be addressed, focusing on key units and conducting thorough inspections. Major cases must be investigated to the end, ensuring clarity. Based on the in-depth inspection, improvement measures should be proposed. Through this year's inspection, some situations should be clarified, and several issues with a tendency and universality should be resolved, providing constructive suggestions for improving the financial system, strengthening legislative work, and achieving rectification and adjustment.

Chi Hai-bin, Director of the State Council's Inspection Office and Deputy Minister of Finance, gave specific arrangements for this year's inspection.

It is reported that this year's inspection will begin in September and basically conclude by the end of the year. The main violations to be inspected include: various financial revenues that should be turned over, including tax evasion and unauthorized tax reductions, inflated costs, embezzlement, withholding, and private distribution of state revenues, false reporting of losses to obtain financial subsidies, and various illegal financial expenditures. Various off-budget funds, including converting budgeted funds to off-budget funds, converting state-owned to collective, establishing "little treasuries," and arbitrarily using production funds for non-production expenditures. Various price violations, including price increases and additional charges in violation of state regulations, high-price resale of important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods, and disguised price increases and surcharges to illegally obtain price differentials. Various consumption funds, including excessive issuance of bonuses, subsidies, and goods, using public funds for banquets, gifts, travel, and private housing, and illegally purchasing restricted and prohibited goods. Private borrowing of public funds must also be seriously investigated and recovered.

The inspection will focus on various levels of economic management departments and law enforcement agencies with confiscated income, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and profit-and-loss units, and collective enterprises with significant business income; companies engaged in commercial, material supply, financial, and foreign trade activities; and departments and enterprises producing important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods.

    今年财税物价大检查开始
    王丙乾要求在“严”“深”“改”上下功夫
    本报北京9月3日讯　记者潘岗报道：1989年全国税收、财务、物价大检查正式开始。国务委员兼财政部部长王丙乾在今天召开的全国大检查工作会议上说，今年的大检查是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神的一项重大措施，是实现三年治理整顿目标的重要手段，各地党政领导一定要把大检查作为一件大事来抓，下决心搞好。
    从1985年到1988年，我国已连续搞了四次大检查，共查出违纪金额440.2亿元，其中上交财政280.5亿元。王丙乾认为这几年大检查成绩很大，但也有一些问题需要改进。他说，一个突出的问题是对查出来的违法违纪问题处理不严，失之过宽，这是造成年年查、年年犯，违法乱纪现象有增无减的一个重要原因。因此，在今年的大检查中，要突出一个“严”字——严格要求，严明纪律，严肃处理。同时，还要解决一个“深”字，要抓住重点单位，查深查透。发现大案要案，要一查到底，搞个水落石出。在深入检查的基础上，提出改进措施。要通过今年的大检查，摸清一些情况，解决几个带有倾向性和普遍性的问题，为完善财经制度，加强立法工作，搞好治理整顿，提供一些建设性意见。
    国务院大检查办公室主任、财政部副部长迟海滨就今年的大检查作了具体部署。
    据悉，今年的大检查从9月份开始到年底基本结束。主要检查的违法乱纪问题有：各项应交财政收入，包括偷税漏税和越权减免税，乱挤成本，侵占、截留、私分应交国家收入，虚报亏损、骗取财政补贴，以及违反国家规定乱开口子、乱支各项财政资金等；各项预算外资金，包括化预算内为预算外，化全民为集体，私设“小金库”，以及擅自挪用生产性资金搞非生产性开支等；各种违价问题，包括违反国家规定乱涨价、乱收费，高价转手倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品，以及变相涨价、加价，非法牟取价差收入等；各项消费基金，包括滥发奖金、补贴和实物，用公款请客送礼、游山玩水、购建私房，乱买控购、禁购商品等。对私人借支公款的问题，也要认真清理、收回。
    检查的重点对象是各级经济主管部门和有罚没收入的执法机关，国营大中型企业和盈亏大户，以及经营收入较多的集体企业；从事商业、物资供销、金融、外贸等活动的公司；生产经营重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品的部门和企业。
