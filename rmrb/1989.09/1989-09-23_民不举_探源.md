Title: Exploring the Roots of "Citizens Do Not Report"

In the fight against corruption, both "official investigation" and "citizen reporting" are necessary. However, during my recent investigation into clean governance in some local government departments, I found that many people, despite being aware of serious economic problems and other law-breaking activities by certain leaders, often choose not to report them. This is mainly due to the following mentalities:

Fear of retaliation. Those who report on their superiors often face subtle or overt retaliation if they are not careful. A staff member in a certain unit reported a leader's misconduct to the supervisory department, but misfortune followed: bonuses were withheld, work assignments were changed, and benefits were denied. Appeals to various departments were futile; the relevant departments only expressed sympathy but were unable to help. Left with no recourse, he couldn't help but regret his initial action. This is chilling to hear. Such examples are countless.

Reporting is futile. Some officials may engage in illegal activities, but bringing charges against them is not easy. Some people therefore feel that reporting is futile, even saying, "Investigate the officials, investigate the officials, the officials are not toppled but I am." Given this, why bother to "chase the fox and get oneself in trouble"?

Following the leader for personal gain. Some people think that reporting on leaders brings no personal benefit, while turning a blind eye allows them to gain some advantages. A section chief in a chemical plant bluntly stated, "The factory director takes the big share, we get a small share, and the masses can scrape by with some crumbs. If the factory director is toppled, we lose our share of the benefits too."

It's none of my business. After all, he is embezzling "public property," which has nothing to do with me.

Fear of isolation. Corrupt officials usually have a few supporters, and their interests are intertwined. Reporting on one of them often angers the others. What's even more humiliating is that when you face retaliation and isolation, some people may even say things like, "Serves you right," "You asked for it," or "You reap what you sow."

To eliminate the above-mentioned mentalities of "citizens do not report," we need to strengthen people's "three senses."

First, a sense of responsibility. People should realize that reporting illegal activities and individuals is a duty that every citizen must fulfill.

Second, a sense of security. There should be practical measures to improve the reward and protection systems for informants.

Third, a sense of trust. The state should ensure that anti-corruption agencies effectively carry out their anti-corruption efforts, so that the public can feel the significant role of reporting in the fight against corruption and boost their confidence.

### “民不举”探源

    “民不举”探源
    惩治腐败，既要“官究”也需“民举”。然而，最近我在一些基层政府部门调查廉政建设时，发现不少人对有关领导人存在的严重经济问题和其他违法乱纪问题，往往知情不举。这主要由以下几种心态造成的：
    怕打击报复。凡举报领导之人，稍有不慎，就会遭到明整暗算。某单位一干部向监察部门举报了单位领导人的违纪问题，厄运接踵而至：奖金被扣，工作被调，福利没份。四处申诉，毫无用处，有关部门只是表示同情，却爱莫能助。他投诉无门，不禁为自己当初的举动懊悔不已。闻之令人心寒。此类事例，不胜枚举。
    告也没用。有些干部虽然干了违法乱纪的事，但要告倒他们绝非易事。有些群众由此觉得告也没用，甚至说：“查官倒，查官倒，官倒未倒我先倒。”既然如此，何苦“打不着狐狸，反惹一身骚”呢？
    跟着沾光。有的人认为，举报领导人自己不能得到任何好处，睁只眼闭只眼反而可以跟着得些实惠。一家化工厂的一位科长直言相告：“厂长捞了大头，我们跟着他可以得小头，群众也能混点零头。告倒了厂长，便把自己那份好处也告没了。”
    关我甚事。反正他捞的是“阿公”（对公家财产的戏称），与我无关。
    怕处境孤立。不廉洁的干部一般都有几个支持者，他们之间利益相连。举报人触犯了其中的一个，往往会惹怒其他人。更难堪的是，当你遭打击受孤立时，有的人还不时给你几句“活该”、“自讨苦吃”、“自作自受”之类的风凉话。
    消除上述种种“民不举”心态，需要增强人们的“三感”。
    一是责任感。要使人们都意识到，举报违法乱纪的人和事，是每一个公民义不容辞的义务。
    二是安全感。要有切实可行的措施，完善对举报人的奖励、保护制度。
    三是信任感。国家应保证反腐败机构卓有成效地开展反腐败斗争的权威，使群众切身感受到举报对反腐败的重大作用，增强他们的信心。
