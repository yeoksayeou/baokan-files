Qiao Shi Meets with Compaoré

BEIJING, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met with President Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso here tonight.

In June 1987, when Compaoré visited China as Minister of State and Minister of Justice, Qiao Shi, then Vice Premier, received him. Compaoré has always called Qiao Shi his "old friend."

Qiao Shi expressed thanks to Burkina Faso for its support for China in quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He said that Compaoré's visit will further promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two parties and the two countries. Compaoré said that all progressive countries should be vigilant against foreign subversion.

After the meeting, Qiao Shi hosted a banquet for Compaoré and his wife.
