　　世界卫生组织专家认为
　　青年卫生保健问题日益突出
    据世界卫生组织提供的统计资料表明：目前，全世界35岁以下的人口大约占总人口的半数以上，其中10岁—25岁的青少年占总人口数的30％左右。
    近年来，随着社会环境的变化，年轻人的卫生保健问题已引起越来越多的国家的关注。专家们认为，年轻人的卫生问题近来已很突出，主要表现在：（1）性行为的变化和受社会上一些不良因素的影响，年轻人中未婚早孕及性传播疾病的发生率明显增加，艾滋病也已成为当今世界一大瘟疫；（2）烟草、酒精和药瘾，严重影响着年轻人的健康；（3）因意外事故致残的病例中，年轻人亦占有极大的比例；（4）年轻人对饮食卫生和口腔保健的需求不断增长。因此有关专家指出，应对年轻人的卫生保健问题给予特别的重视和指导。
