The cycling and archery competitions also concluded.

Yesterday, 19-year-old athlete Gao Yonghong from Shandong set a new national record of 50.54 seconds in the men's 400-meter hurdles final, breaking the previous record of 50.62 seconds. This is the only national record broken in the track and field events.

The competition saw several upsets, with Henan's Li Lin, who ranked third in the men's preliminary round, and Zhang Qiaoling, who ranked seventh, winning the gold medals in the men's and women's 1-kilometer time trial respectively.

In the archery competition, the last two gold medals for the men's and women's team events were won by Sichuan and Shandong teams respectively.

　　第二届青运会奖牌所剩无几
　　各代表团鼓足干劲最后一搏
    本报沈阳9月14日电　记者黄振中、汪大昭报道：第二届青运会所剩赛事已不多了，各代表团正在尽最大努力，争夺最后的金牌。在男篮决赛中，东道主辽宁队夺魁，乒乓球男女混双决赛北京选手获第一。自行车和射箭赛也鸣金收兵。
    昨天，19岁的山东选手高永红在男子甲组400米栏决赛中，以50秒54的成绩打破了50秒62的全国纪录。这是田径比赛中唯一打破的全国纪录。
    为时3天的自行车场地赛，辽宁队一路领先，得4枚金牌，居各队之首，河南队紧随其后得3枚金牌，另一枚为北京队所获。比赛中冷门频爆，河南队预赛第3名的李林和预赛第7名的张巧玲分获男女1公里计时赛金牌。
    射箭赛最后男女团体2枚金牌分别被四川和山东队所获。男团决赛本是辽宁队的强项，预赛中该队显示出强大的实力，可惜天有不测风云，辽宁队由于主力队员生病，改换其他队员，从而影响实力。
    足球半决赛已见分晓，东道主辽宁队在万余球迷的呐喊助威下以3∶2战胜天津队。另一场比赛，广东队以3∶1战胜江苏队，杀入决赛圈。15日晚辽宁队将同广东队争夺足球桂冠。
