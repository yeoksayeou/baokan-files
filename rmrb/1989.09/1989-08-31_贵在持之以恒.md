This year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government have made it a priority in their efforts to combat corruption and promote clean governance to decisively curb the practice of using public funds for feasting and drinking in government offices. Since June 5, this "public menace" has abruptly ceased across the province, sparking a strong response.

In the more than two months since the ban on feasting and drinking, various unexpected situations have arisen: from the provincial level to municipal and county levels, all guesthouses, from provincial cities to small and medium-sized towns, all hotels, restaurants, and banquet halls have seen a sharp decline in business, with doors left cold and business revenues dropping by 70%. Some have had to lay off staff, switch industries, or close down. The so-called "delicacy" of soft-shelled turtles has dropped from over 20 yuan per pound to around 10 yuan, and beer, which was once in high demand, has become a backlog of unsold goods. Various famous cigarettes and liquors have seen their prices plummet. The entertainment expenses of government offices at all levels have been reduced by 80-90%, and both the hosts and guests of banquets feel as if they have been freed from shackles, able to concentrate on their work. The general public has expressed their approval with surprise and joy. The cessation of this feasting and drinking wind has indeed sparked such a strong response, making people realize that feasting and drinking is not a small matter.

Feasting and drinking is more than just "wasting money."

Some people think, "Eating and drinking is a small matter." In reality, this is not the case.

According to investigations and estimates, in recent years, the annual expenditure of party and government offices in the province on feasting and drinking has been around one billion yuan. Adding the feasting and drinking of enterprises and village cadres, conservatively estimated, the annual expenditure is over three billion yuan. Three billion yuan, if used to build power stations, could construct a hydropower station with a capacity of nearly 100,000 kilowatts or a thermal power station with a capacity of 200,000 kilowatts; if used for transportation, it could build over 300 kilometers of second-class highways, and if used for education, it could solve the long-standing problem of dilapidated school buildings in the province. Such a huge amount of money has been wasted on the tables of feasts!

The political and ideological harm of using public funds for feasting and drinking is particularly severe. Feasting and drinking have always been closely linked to the misuse of power for personal gain. Some leaders and officials who hold power over people, finances, and materials often judge the richness of a banquet and the status of accompanying personnel when they arrive at a place. You treat me with generous hospitality, and I will reward you with favorable terms for funds and materials. The receiving units are well aware of the principle of "reciprocity," and they compete with each other, leading to extravagant spending, to the point where whatever is scarce and expensive in the market appears on the banquet table. Amidst the clinking of glasses and mutual flattery, one project after another, one allocation after another, and one transaction after another are negotiated based on the depth of personal favors. The Party's policies and principles are discarded, losing their binding force. Bribery, corruption, and bureaucratism become increasingly serious, clearly leading to political corruption.

The spread of the feasting and drinking wind has caused some cadres to gradually distance themselves from the masses, unable to see the sufferings of the people or hear their voices. Instead, they become accustomed to a life of constant "culinary delights" and smooth sailing, gradually adapting to, satisfying, and becoming attached to this lifestyle, eventually degenerating into a life of leisure and parasitism. More comrades, not wanting to be ridiculed as "fools" or "idiots," and fearing to be shunned for not being "savvy," also reluctantly join the feasting and drinking crowd. This shows that the feasting and drinking wind has seriously corroded the revolutionary will of the cadres.

Treating the deep-seated problem requires strong medicine.

The crackdown on feasting and drinking in our province is not the first or second time. But there has never been a time when it was truly stopped, and each time it was stopped, it rebounded even stronger.

In the first half of this year, the provincial party committee and government leadership seriously reflected on the issue of feasting and drinking. They felt that the key to stopping the feasting and drinking wind was not a lack of ability but a lack of resolve and effort. In the past, they always talked tough but acted weakly, and lacked the persistence to follow through. Therefore, they decided to use "strong medicine" to treat this "chronic illness."

First, they made the crackdown on feasting and drinking transparent and open to public supervision.

Through newspapers, radio stations, and television stations at all levels in the province, the regulations for stopping the feasting and drinking wind were publicized throughout the province. Each receiving unit posted the regulations on the walls, creating an atmosphere of public supervision.

Second, the regulations were specific, easy to implement, and convenient for supervision. For example, they clearly stipulated the implementation of separate dining, one dish and one soup per person, and prohibited expensive dishes such as shark's fin. Those who violated the regulations, including the host, the guest, and the responsible person of the receiving unit, as well as the accounting personnel who did not intervene, would be fined. Those who violated the regulations four times would be demoted or removed from their posts depending on the severity of the offense.

At the same time, it was stipulated that informants who provided accurate information would be rewarded with a bonus; if the discipline inspection and supervision departments did not handle the reports within half a month, they would be held accountable for dereliction of duty. These specific and clear regulations left no room for flexibility, and anyone who dared to "cross the line" would be punished accordingly.

Third, the implementation was swift and decisive, with violations being investigated and punished promptly and strictly, ensuring that past practices of "three warnings and five exemptions" would not be repeated. As soon as the regulations were announced, the provincial committee, provincial people's congress, and provincial political consultative conference invited senior comrades to form inspection teams and visit various parts of the province to inspect and supervise. The media also closely cooperated, exposing violations and encouraging compliance. Those who violated the regulations and engaged in feasting and drinking were immediately investigated and exposed to the public. So far, many officials who violated the regulations and engaged in feasting and drinking have been reported and investigated across the province, with some being exposed in provincial and municipal newspapers.

Fourth, the leaders set an example by leading from the front. Recently, Jiangxi Province experienced severe floods, and the provincial party secretary Mao Zhiyong and the governor Wu Guanzheng went to various places to lead the people in flood relief and disaster rescue, working tirelessly in the wind and rain, without drinking a drop of alcohol or eating a meal at a banquet.

"Keeping the mouth shut" is key to persistence.

Although Jiangxi Province has basically stopped the practice of party and government officials using public funds for feasting and drinking, this is only a good start.

Currently, theories such as "no eating and drinking, no economic activity" and "whoever stops feasting and drinking loses out" have not been completely eradicated. Some people who are addicted to feasting and drinking still want to revive the wind. The petty cash boxes in government offices and individual restaurants can still provide convenience for feasting and drinking, especially the past practices of starting but not finishing, beginning but not ending, which have caused serious inertia among the people, to the point where some people openly ask, "How long will the crackdown on feasting and drinking last?" The general public is also concerned about whether it can be sustained.

In light of this, Provincial Party Secretary Mao Zhiyong clearly pointed out that the crackdown on feasting and drinking must be persistent and sustained, and this "chronic illness" must be completely cured.

To meet this requirement, we must deepen our understanding and increase our awareness, raising the crackdown on feasting and drinking to the level of implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, deeply understanding the significance of the crackdown on feasting and drinking in adhering to the foundation of the state and walking the path to a strong country.

We must consciously uphold the spirit of hard work and frugality, regarding extravagance and corruption as shameful, and ensuring that all party members and cadres can consciously resist the feasting and drinking wind.

    贵在持之以恒
    王达智
    今年，中共江西省委、江西省人民政府在惩治腐败、抓廉政建设中，把坚决刹住党政机关用公款吃喝的歪风，作为一项突出的事情抓，从6月5日起，这一“公害”在全省各地戛然止息，引起强烈反响。
    吃喝风被刹住的两个多月来，各地出现了种种始料未及的情况：从省里到地市县的所有招待所，从省城到中小城镇所有的宾馆、酒楼、饭店，生意骤然萧条，门庭冷落，营业额锐减70％，有的被迫裁员、转业或关门，被称之为“席上珍品”的甲鱼每斤由20多元跌到10元左右，常常要排队抢购的啤酒，成了滞销积压货物，各种名烟名酒价格顿跌；各级党政机关的招待费用普遍减少了80—90％，吃请者和请吃者都感到像卸去了枷锁一样轻松自在，可以集中精力干工作了，广大群众则以惊喜的口气加以赞许。一股吃喝风被刹住，竟引起如此强烈的反响，更使人深切感到吃喝决不是一个小问题。
          吃喝何止“山空”
    有人认为，“吃吃喝喝，小事一桩”。事实并非如此。
    据调查估算，近几年全省党政机关每年用于吃喝的费用一亿元左右，加上企业和村干部的吃喝，保守地估计，年耗资要达三亿元以上。三亿元，如果用以建电站，能建一座装机容量近10万千瓦的水电站，或一座20万千瓦的火电站；用于办交通，可修二级公路300多公里，用于办教育，长期没有解决的全省中小学危房问题可全部得到解决。如此巨额的资金白白耗费在杯盘狼藉的餐桌子上了！
    公款吃喝，在政治、思想方面的危害，尤其严重。吃喝之所以成风，始终和以权谋私紧紧联系在一起。有些掌握人财物实权的领导干部和工作人员，每到一地，往往看宴席的丰薄，陪同人员职位的高低办事，你给我款待优厚之恩，我报你资金物资优惠之德。接待单位熟知“投桃报李”，竞相攀比，使吃喝发展到挥霍无度的地步，以致市场上什么最紧缺、什么最昂贵，筵席上就有什么。在觥筹交错、相互恭维声中，一个个项目，一项项拨款，一笔笔交易以人情厚薄作标准谈妥了。党的政策和原则被丢弃一边，失去了约束力。行贿受贿，贪赃枉法官僚主义等越来越严重，明显地导致政治上的腐败。
    吃喝风的泛滥，使有些干部逐渐远离群众，看不到群众的疾苦，听不到群众的呼声，而对那种“口福”不断，左右逢源的生活和处境，由逐渐适应到满足和留恋，蜕变到只想吃喝，不想工作，“尸位素餐”过上了寄生生活。更多的同志，不吃被讥为“呆”、“傻”，抵制被斥为“不通人情”而遭冷落，在这种无可奈何的情况下，也愤然认为“不吃白不吃”，投入到了吃喝的行列。由此可见，吃喝风对干部革命意志的腐蚀，也是严重的。
              治顽症须下重药
    刹吃喝风，在我们江西省已非止一次二次。但没有哪一次真正刹住过，而且刹一次、反复一次，风势更烈。
    今年上半年，省委、省政府领导认真反思了吃喝问题。感到吃喝风屡刹不止关键不在无能为力，而在决心不大，抓得不力。过去，总是说起来嘴硬，抓起来手软，坚持下去乏力。于是，决心下“重药”以治“顽症”。
    一是公开透明，把刹吃喝风置于全省广大群众的监督之下。
    通过全省大小报刊，省地（市）县广播台、站和电视台等新闻媒介，将刹吃喝风的规定照示全省，各个接待单位原文抄录、张贴于墙，形成了人人关注的监督气氛。
    二是制定的规定，规范性强，易于操作，便于监督。例如：明确规定了实行分餐制，一盘菜一个汤，不准上海参等名贵菜肴。违犯了，宴请者、被宴请者，连同接待单位的负责人，不予抵制的财会人员都要处以罚款。违犯4次的领导者，按情节轻重，给予降职或撤职处分。
    同时规定：对举报属实者发给奖金；纪检和监督部门接到举报后半个月内不进行查处的，按失职、渎职论处。这些具体而明确的规定，没有什么弹性，谁敢“越雷池一步”谁就会受到应得的处理。
    三是组织实施雷厉风行，违章查处及时严格，决不让过去那种“三令五申”、“下不为例”的事重演。规定一公布，就请省顾委、省人大、省政协老同志组成检查组分赴全省各地检查督促，新闻单位也密切配合，揭露违纪现象，鼓励守纪行为。违纪吃喝者，一旦发现立即查处并公之于众。到目前为止，全省举报、查处的多名违纪吃喝的干部，有的在省地报纸上“曝光”。
    四是领导带头，以身作则。前不久，江西省大面积发生洪涝灾害，省委书记毛致用、省长吴官正等均分赴各地和群众一起抗洪救灾，风里来，雨里去，十分辛苦，没有喝过一口酒、吃过一餐招待饭。
        “守口”贵在坚持
    江西省虽然基本刹住了党政机关干部用公款吃喝的歪风，但仅仅是个良好开端。
    目前，“不吃不喝，经济难活”，“谁刹吃喝谁吃亏”等吃喝理论，并没有完全肃清。有些吃喝成癖的人，还想把吃喝风重新刮起来。机关的小钱柜、个体酒家，还可为吃喝提供方便，特别是过去一些有头无尾、有始无终的作风，在群众中造成了严重的惰性心态，以致有人公然提问，吃喝风还要刹多久，广大干部群众也担心坚持不下去。
    有鉴于此，省委书记毛致用同志明确指出，刹吃喝风要持之以恒，贵在坚持，一定要根治这个“顽症”。
    要达到这个要求，必须在认识上继续深化，增强自觉性，把刹吃喝风提到贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神的高度来认识，深刻认识刹吃喝风对坚持立国之本，走好强国之路的意义。
    自觉以艰苦奋斗、勤俭过日子为荣，以挥霍浪费，奢侈腐败为耻，做到使所有党员、干部都能自觉抵制吃喝风。
