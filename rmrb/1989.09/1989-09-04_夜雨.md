The night rain invades my dreams, pattering softly, gently. Is this the rain in my dreams, or the dream in the rain? Streetlights burst into fireworks, cars are adorned with jewels, buildings draped in clouds, and the rain brings a vibrant glow to the night city. Noise fades away, and everywhere there is singing. Dust disappears, and freshness fills the heart. Even the usual irritation caused by heavy trucks passing by is swallowed by the waves kicked up by their wheels. Occasionally, the tinkling of a bicycle bell rings out, clear and distant, and the laughter and whispers of lovers returning home, accompanied by the patter of their footsteps, are all pleasant to the ear. The night rain makes the city gentle. The rain is fine and endless. What a vast and boundless rainy night! Is this rain from heaven? It lingers on the roof, weaving a tender love song, seeping from the swaying willow leaves, and bursting out of the iron pipes and steel windows with a short, crisp rhythm. This clear and harmonious rain melody suddenly makes me wonder—this rain sound, so close and heard countless times, seems strangely distant...

As a little girl with yellow braids, I loved the rain. I would take an oil-paper umbrella and joyfully jump in puddles in the endless rain. Later, when I went to the countryside, big and small bowls would catch the rain leaking from the thatched roof, and frogs would jump out from under the bed, but I still thought: let it rain, let it rain. Rain means we don't have to work in the fields, and I could sit on the doorstep, playing my beloved harmonica, letting all the melodies stored in my heart drift away into the rain like a faint, distant smoke. Even now, walking in the rain and listening to the stories it tells is still a cherished event for me...

The rain gradually fades away, leaving behind an enchanting tranquility. Nestled in the dream of rain, I walk into the dream of the rain... The morning breeze brings freshness and gentleness, and the sky is a deep blue with a few clouds drifting like young girls in silk dresses. Outside the door, the brick path is washed clean and shiny by the night rain, like a red carpet welcoming guests with solemn dignity. I walk this path every day. On both sides are familiar yet strange watercolor galleries filled with green shadows and buildings. The grass and flowers of various colors are all covered with a layer of crystal. Looking forward and backward, there is no end in sight. Suddenly, I look up, and in the distance, a crane's long arm is holding up the rising sun, a sun that has been cleansed, like a giant red lantern.

    夜雨

    夜雨袭入我的梦，淅淅沥沥，从从容容。是梦中的雨，还是雨中的梦？路灯喷出礼花，汽车嵌上宝石，楼群披上云霓，雨给夜晚的城市带来绚丽；噪音绝耳，处处吟唱，尘屑全无，满腔清新。就连平日里重型卡车驰过撩起的缕缕烦躁，也被车轮卷起的浪花浸没。偶尔掠过的自行车铃声，脆亮清幽，晚归恋人的笑声窃语伴着噼里叭啦的脚步声声悦耳。夜雨使城市变得温柔。雨丝匀密，雨幕无涯。好一个绵绵的雨夜，浩茫的世界！这是天堂里落下的么？在屋棚顶盘桓起缠绵的恋曲，从摇曳的杨树叶上泄出隐约起伏的涛响，朝着铁管钢窗迸出富有活力的短促铿锵。这明晰而和谐的雨中曲使我忽然惊异，这近在身边听了无数回的雨声似莫名的遥远起来……黄毛丫头的我见雨便疯，撑一把油纸伞在漫漫雨水中专爱挑水洼踩踏，其乐无穷；后来下乡，大盆小碗接着草房顶的漏雨，床底蹦出青蛙，却仍想着：下吧下吧，下雨可以歇工不下田，坐在门槛上，让心爱的口琴翻找出心中存储的所有旋律，送进雨中的轻烟幽远地弥散；至今，在雨中散步，倾听雨中的故事仍是我盼望的“盛典”……雨声渐渐远去，留下一片迷人的静谧。依偎着梦中的雨，我走进雨中的梦……晨风裹着清新和温柔拂面而来，天空碧蓝碧蓝，几片流云像穿着纱裙的小姑娘在恣意地散步。门外砖砌的小径被夜雨冲刷得洁净光亮，像迎宾红地毯那般庄严沉静。我每天都在走这条路。路两旁是熟悉而陌生的绘满绿荫和楼舍的水彩画廊，草地和五颜六色的花都罩着一层晶莹，前后望不到尽头。猛然仰首，前方，一个塔吊的长臂正擎起旭日，那是一轮经过洗礼的太阳，像一盏巨大的红灯笼。
