In the 40 years since the founding of New China, economic and trade ties between mainland China and Hong Kong have developed rapidly. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China has implemented an open-door policy, ushering in a new stage of economic cooperation between the two regions. The economic ties between the two regions have expanded from mere trade exchanges to include finance, industry, technology, transportation, and tourism.

The mainland is the primary supplier of food, daily necessities, and industrial raw materials needed by Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong is also a traditional export market for the mainland and a major source of foreign exchange earnings. Over the past 40 years, bilateral trade has seen significant growth. In 1950, the total trade volume between the mainland and Hong Kong was HK$2.043 billion. By 1979, this had increased to HK$17.048 billion. In 1988, the bilateral trade volume reached HK$288.572 billion, growing 16 times over the decade. In the past 10 years, the mainland's position and role in Hong Kong's re-export trade have become increasingly important. The mainland has become the largest source of re-export goods for Hong Kong and the largest market for re-export trade. Hong Kong also plays an increasingly important role in connecting the economic ties between the mainland and Taiwan.

Since China implemented the reform and opening-up policy, Hong Kong has been the largest source of foreign investment for the mainland. There are over 12,000 enterprises in the mainland invested in by Hong Kong businesspeople, with actual direct investment exceeding $5 billion. At the same time, Hong Kong is also the region where mainland enterprises invest the most overseas.

In recent years, economic cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong has expanded into the industrial production sector. The mainland provides Hong Kong with low-cost land and labor. Hong Kong manufacturers, primarily through the "three-come-one-compensate" model, have shifted some labor-intensive production processes to coastal provinces and cities in the mainland. Some regions in the mainland have become vast production bases for Hong Kong, which has helped alleviate the difficulties faced by Hong Kong's industry and enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong products. This is also beneficial for the development of the mainland's economy. In addition, technological cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong has also made a good start.

In summary, the economic ties between the mainland and Hong Kong are based on mutual cooperation, mutual promotion, and common prosperity. They are interdependent and share a common fate. Looking to the future, the economic cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong has a broad prospect for development.

    内地与香港之间的经济合作
    岗岩
    新中国成立40年来，我国内地与香港之间的经济贸易联系得到了迅速的发展。特别是中共十一届三中全会以来，我国实行对外开放政策，开创了两地之间经济合作的新阶段。两地的经济联系已从过去的仅限于贸易往来扩展到金融、工业、科技、交通以及旅游等领域。
    内地是香港居民需要的食品、日用消费品和工业需要的原材料的主要供应地。香港也是内地的传统出口市场，是我国吸取现汇的重要来源地。40年来，双边贸易有了很大的发展。1950年内地与香港的贸易总额为20.43亿港元，1979年增加到170.48亿港元。1988年双边贸易总额达到2885.72亿港元，10年间增长了16倍。近10年来，内地在香港转口贸易中的地位和作用日益加强。内地已成为香港转口货的最大来源地和转口贸易的最大销售市场。香港在沟通大陆和台湾之间的经济联系中亦日益扮演了重要角色。
    我国实行改革开放政策以来，香港是内地引进外资最多的地区。港商在内地投资的企业有1.2万多家，实际使用的直接投资金额超过50亿美元。与此同时，香港也是内地企业在海外投资最多的地区。
    近几年来，内地与香港之间的经济合作已扩大到工业生产领域。内地为香港提供低廉的土地和劳力，香港厂商以“三来一补”为主要形式，将部分劳动密集型产品生产工序转移到内地沿海各省市，内地的部分地区已成为香港的巨大生产基地，这对缓解香港工业面临的困难，增强港产品的国际竞争力起了积极作用，也有利于内地经济发展。此外，内地与香港之间的科技合作也有了良好的开端。
    综上所述，内地与香港之间的经济联系是建立在相互合作、相互促进、共同繁荣的基础上的，是唇齿相依、休戚与共的关系。展望未来，内地与香港之间的经济合作关系仍有着广阔的发展前景。
