Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province is one of the earliest cities to engage in military-civilian joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization activities.

Recently, after studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Changzhou Military District Party Committee believed that military-civilian joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization activities should focus on cultivating people. They decided to adjust the focus of the joint construction activities to jointly cultivating the "four-haves" new people.

　　常州确定军民共建新重点
    江苏省常州市是军民开展共建社会主义精神文明活动比较早的城市。
    最近，常州军分区党委学习了十三届四中全会公报后，认为军民共建社会主义精神文明活动应该重在育人，决定把共建活动重点调整到共育“四有”新人上来。
