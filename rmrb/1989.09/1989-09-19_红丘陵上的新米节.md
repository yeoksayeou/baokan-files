Every year when the early rice is ready for harvest, the people of the red hills in southern Hunan celebrate the New Rice Festival.

In earlier times, after two or three seasons, the granaries and storage bins of each household would be nearly empty by this time. The aroma of new rice was as inviting as the first warm breezes of spring after a long winter, bringing a sense of relief. The New Rice Festival had to be celebrated before the harvest could begin, ensuring a smooth transition from old to new. Large households, where labor was scarce, would use their children to spread the word about the ripening rice, hoping to prompt the village leaders to declare the festival and start the harvest. They would deliberately make noise with empty baskets and brooms, signaling their eagerness for the new rice to be cooked.

Nowadays, with the land in the red hills of southern Hunan all contracted out, the granaries remain full and well-stocked by the time of the New Rice Festival. There is no need to borrow or barter for a few cups of rice. When they see the heavy ears of grain bending down, they know it is time for the festival. They need to clear out their storage bins to make room for the new harvest, drying them out to prevent mold. For the people of the red hills, the New Rice Festival is a time of both joy and concern: where will they store all the old grain?

The New Rice Festival on the red hills does not have a fixed date. It is decided by consensus and approved by the eldest member of the village.

On this day, there are no fireworks, but pigs are slaughtered, and wine is poured. Families that raise chickens often set aside one for the festival, saving it even for rare guests, to serve as a delicacy on the New Rice Festival table. There is a saying in the red hills: "The year ends with the New Year, but the new rice marks the start of the year's meals." This means that while the New Year's Eve is the end of the old year, the New Rice Festival marks the beginning of the new year's eating.

After breakfast on this day, women and children clean the courtyards, porches, and threshing floors. Men go to their contracted fields and cut a few stalks of rice from the most mature spots, then return home to shell the grains with their families. In this moment, no one is unhappy. Each kernel of white, plump new rice is a testament to their hard work and the hopes they have nurtured since spring. At noon, when the fragrant new rice is ready, the family sets out the wine and dishes on the open terrace, performing traditional rituals to celebrate.

It is time to eat. Three generations gather around the table. The children are the first to call for the new rice. Usually, they can eat casually, but this time they must wait for the elders to taste it first. When the grandfather happily takes his first bite of the delicious new rice, the clattering of chopsticks begins. As the wine flows, the son picks out the best piece of chicken breast and places it in the grandfather's bowl, saying, "Father, you've aged another year. Take care of yourself so you can enjoy the new rice next year too." The grandfather, stroking his white hair, understands and replies, "Don't worry, with my strong body, I'll live another seven or eight years!" He straightens his slightly hunched back, making everyone laugh. But he quietly puts the meat into his grandson's bowl, saying lovingly, "Grow up quickly, good boy. By next New Rice Festival, our family will have another strong man!" The grandson thinks of his mother, seeing his bowl already full of food, he calls her to help. But the busy mother, who has been working all day, quickly eats a few mouthfuls of rice. As everyone is enjoying their meal and drinking wine, she enters the small bathroom. Soon, the sound of sharpening the sickle, sand-sand, comes from there.

　　红丘陵上的新米节
　　邓杰
    每年早稻开镰时，湘南红丘陵上是要过新米节的。
    早些年，各家的谷仓粮柜经过两三个季节的付出，在这个时节早已空得见底了，于是人们闻到了这种诱人的香味，就像在漫长的冬天里听到温馨的春风一样激动，大大显出些如释重负的感觉。因为新米节过了才能开镰，才能新老相接，于是人多劳力少的大户人家便用自家小孩的嘴舌向着满村满院放出些关于禾熟了该过新米节的风来，自己却把一只只空桶空柜一咕嘟搬到显眼的禾场，一把脱毛的老帚儿把柜桶儿故意弄得咚咚响，大概是想传递些信息，或者说是想让队干部们看看：快过节开镰吧，我们正等着新米下锅呢。
    如今，湘南红丘陵的田土全给承包了，到了快过新米节的时候，各家各户的仓库丰满依旧，灿然依旧，用不着像过去那样为了半升米这家借那户赊了。当他们看到那些沉甸甸的谷穗子一天天往下坠时，才知道该过新米节了，该把自己的谷柜什么的腾出来，晒一晒湿气，不然收回来的新谷迟早要生霉的。现在对于新米节，丘陵人一方面举家欢庆，一方面又很犯难：这么多吃不完的老谷往那儿搁呢？红丘陵上的新米节没有固定的日子，总是经过大家商计，报村里最长辈同意，定下一个日子。
    这一天没有爆竹燃放，但猪是要宰的，酒是要打的，养鸡的人家在春节时总是特地留下一只，不管哪个稀客贵宾来临也舍不得去杀，图的是新米节桌上的那一碗珍肴。红丘陵上有这么一句谚语：过年过尾，新米吃新。意思就是大年三十乃一年之尾，而新米节才是一年吃食的新开头。
    这天早饭后，妇幼们打扫庭院、阶檐和禾场。男人们来到各自的责任田，在最熟的地方割下一绺绺稻穗子，然后回到家里，同家人们一粒一粒地剥起来……在这个时刻，没有人是不高兴的，那一颗颗雪白而丰满的新米是他们用自己的汗水浇灌出来的，是一种他们打开春以来对种籽的殷切期盼啊！正午十二点，当香喷喷的新米饭做就时，一家人便把酒菜先摆放于露天的阳台下，经过民俗礼仪以表庆祝。
    开饭了，一家三代把桌子围得满满的。最先嚷着要吃新米饭的自然是那些孩子们；平时随便一点确也无妨，但这回可不能乱来，得让长辈先尝尝；当做爷爷的乐呵呵地吃下第一口鲜腻可口的新米饭时，桌旁的筷子才纷纷行动起来。酒快喝到了半路上，儿子便夹一块最好的鸡胸脯给做爷爷的，接着说一句比蕴含在鸡胸脯的情谊还重的话：爹，你又老了一年，要多保重！这年头日子好过，争取明年呷新米饭时还有这么健爽。做爷爷的抚着白鬓心领神会说：你放心，凭我这身子骨，活他个七年八载没事！于是微驼的腰儿硬朗地一挺，顿时把大家逗笑了。可是他又悄悄地把肉放进孙子的碗里，疼爱地说：快长啊，好乖乖，等明年过新米节时，咱家又多了个男子汉罗！孙子想到的当然是妈妈，他看到碗里的菜已经堆满时，便唤妈妈来帮忙。可是，那一天忙个不歇的女主人匆匆扒下几口饭，在大家吃得正香喝得正酣的时候，进了那间狭小的水房。不一会儿，只听一阵愉快的磨镰声沙沙地传了过来……
