Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th.

Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member Ligachov emphasized that the most important political issue at present is party unity. Without party unity, reform will fail.

Ligachov made these remarks at a training class meeting held in the capital of Kirghizia, Frunze. His speech was published on September 9th in *Pravda*.

Ligachov pointed out that there are currently forces that have a completely different understanding of reform. They attempt to undermine the socialist foundation, establish private ownership and a multi-party system, and disrupt political stability. They slander the party, attack party members and party leaders. They engage in demagogic political propaganda, but they themselves are unwilling to do anything to overcome the difficulties that have arisen...

Ligachov said in his speech that party unity can only be achieved on the basis of democratizing party life, party discipline, and strictly adhering to the principles of democratic centralism and the party constitution. He said that here, compromise is necessary and beneficial, but compromise should not lose principles or create illusions, and even more, it should not abandon the most important and fundamental things in "our policy."

Ligachov also criticized some Communist Party members for inciting ethnic disputes and participating in gatherings of anti-socialist nationalist factions, believing that such behavior is unacceptable.

　　苏共领导人利加乔夫强调
　　最重要的是党的团结
    新华社莫斯科9月10日电　苏共中央政治局委员利加乔夫强调，当前最重要的政治问题是党的团结，没有党的团结，改革将会破产。
    利加乔夫是在吉尔吉斯共和国首府伏龙芝举办的一个讲习班会议上说这番话的。9日《真理报》刊登了他的讲话。
    利加乔夫指出，目前存在这样一种势力：他们对改革完全是另一种理解。他们企图冲毁社会主义基础，建立私有制和多党制，破坏政治稳定。他们污蔑党，攻击党员和党的领导干部。他们从事蛊惑性政治宣传，但自己却不愿为克服已出现的困难做任何事情……
    利加乔夫在讲话中说，只有在党内生活民主化、党的纪律以及严格遵守民主集中制原则和党章要求的基础上才能达到党的团结。他说，在这里，妥协是必要的、有益的，但妥协不能丧失原则和制造假象，更不能放弃构成“我们政策中最主要、最根本的东西”。
    利加乔夫还指责某些共产党员挑起民族纠纷和参加反社会主义的民族主义派别集会，认为这种行为是不能容许的。
