    A New Energy Base Emerges on the Grasslands

    Our reporter informs that over the past 40 years, with the strong support of the state, the energy industry in Inner Mongolia has grown from nothing to a significant presence, establishing a relatively complete production system. Numerous large and medium-sized energy projects have been built, gradually forming an important new energy base in China.

    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is rich in energy resources. The region has a coal-bearing area of 100,000 square kilometers. The proven coal reserves amount to 217 billion tons, accounting for 1/4 of the national proven total reserves, with a potential reserve of 1.2 trillion tons, second only to Xinjiang. Among these, there are 15 large coal fields with reserves ranging from 50 to 100 billion tons. The region also has 800 kilometers of the Yellow River and abundant groundwater resources, providing favorable conditions for the construction of large pit-head power plants.

    Over the past 40 years, the state has invested 8 billion yuan in the basic construction of the energy industry in the autonomous region. This has resulted in the completion and operation of 36 coal mines and open-pit mines, forming a coal production capacity of nearly 40 million tons. There are 78 power plants with a capacity of 500,000 kilowatts or more, with a total installed capacity of 2.6929 million kilowatts. By 1988, the region's annual raw coal production reached 3,734 tons, and the power generation reached 13.85 billion kilowatt-hours. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the state has designated energy as a strategic focus for national economic development, leading to rapid growth in the region's energy industry. From 1980 to 1989, the state invested 2 billion yuan in the coal industry in the autonomous region, exceeding the total investment in the previous 30 years. New and expanded coal mines include Yimin River, Holingol, Zhalainuoer, Dayan, Pingzhuang, Haibowan, and Wuda, adding 12 million tons of production capacity. Investment in the basic construction of the power industry is 3.74 times that of the previous decade, adding 1.6 million kilowatts of installed capacity for power generation equipment. China's first 600,000-kilowatt power generation unit was completed and put into operation at the Yuanbaoshan Power Plant in Inner Mongolia in 1985. The two 200,000-kilowatt power generation units at the Tongliao Power Plant were also completed and put into operation in 1985.

    During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, four of the five major open-pit coal mines prioritized by the state—Yuanbaoshan, Yimin River, Holingol, and Zhunge'er—are located in Inner Mongolia. The Dongsheng coal field in the Ordos Plateau has a proven reserve of 95.2 billion tons, making it one of the largest coal fields discovered in China in recent years. So far, seven coal mines with an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons each have been designed, with four mines already under construction. The Zhunge'er coal field, which is currently in the preparatory stage, has excellent coal quality and a proven reserve of 25.9 billion tons. Construction is scheduled to begin next year. The first large-scale thermal power plant designed and constructed by the autonomous region—Fengzhen Power Plant with four 200,000-kilowatt power generation units—began construction in 1986, with the first unit expected to be completed and put into operation by the end of this year.

    The Erlian Oil Field, currently under rapid development, has proven reserves of about 100 million tons. So far, 447 oil wells and water injection wells have been drilled, with an annual oil production capacity of 100 million tons expected next year. The 365-kilometer oil pipeline from Alxa to Saihan Tala is expected to be completed and put into operation by the end of this year. The Hohhot Oil Refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 10 million tons of crude oil, is currently preparing for construction.

    According to the national energy planning layout, by the end of the century, Inner Mongolia will build 7 thermal coal bases, 1 coking coal base, and 1 export coal base, with a coal production capacity of over 100 million tons, becoming China's second-largest coal base. By 2000, around the coal bases, a number of large pit-head power plant groups will be built, with a total installed capacity of power generation reaching over 10 million kilowatts.

    草原上崛起新兴能源基地
    本报讯　建国40年来，在国家的大力支援下，内蒙古的能源工业从无到有，从小到大，建立起比较完整的生产体系，兴建了数十个大中型能源重点工程，逐步形成了我国重要的新兴能源基地。
    内蒙古自治区能源资源十分丰富，全区含煤面积达10万平方公里，已探明煤炭储量2170亿吨，占全国已探明总储量的1／4，远景储量1.2万亿吨，仅次于新疆，居全国第二位。其中，储量在50—100亿吨以上的大煤田就有15处。境内有800公里黄河水和丰富的地下水资源，为建设大型坑口电站提供有利条件。
    40年来，国家用于自治区能源工业基本建设投资为80亿元，建成投产矿井及露天矿36个，形成煤炭生产能力近4000万吨；500千瓦以上发电厂78座，总装机容量269.29万千瓦。到1988年，自治区原煤年产量达到3734吨，发电量达到138.5亿千瓦小时。十一届三中全会以来，国家把能源确定为国民经济发展的战略重点，使自治区的能源工业得到了迅速的发展。从1980年到1989年，国家用于自治区煤炭工业的投资高达20亿元，比前30年基建投资总额还多。新建和扩建了伊敏河、霍林河、扎赉诺尔、大雁、平庄、海勃湾、乌达等大中型煤矿，新增生产能力1200万吨；用于电力工业基本建设投资，是前十年的3.74倍，新增发电设备总装机容量160万千瓦。我国第一台单机容量最大的60万千瓦发电机组，于1985年在内蒙古元宝山发电厂建成投产，通辽发电厂两台各20万千瓦发电机组也相继在1985年建成投产。
    “七五”期间，国家重点开发的五大露天煤矿中，就有元宝山、伊敏河、霍林河、准格尔四大露天煤矿在内蒙古境内。鄂尔多斯高原上的东胜煤田，探明储量高达952亿吨，是我国近年来探明的特大型煤田，该煤田迄今已完成7个年产60万吨矿点的设计，其中4个矿已开工建设。正在积极做前期准备工作的准格尔煤田，煤质优良，探明储量为259亿吨，明年即可动工大规模兴建。自治区自行设计、施工的首座大型火力发电厂——丰镇发电厂4台各20万千瓦发电机组于1986年开始兴建，首台机组可于年内竣工投产。
    正在加紧开发建设的内蒙古二连油田，探明储量1亿吨左右，目前已打完采油井和注水井447口，明年可具有100万吨原油开采能力。阿尔善至赛汉塔拉的365公里输油管道，年内即可建成投产。年加工原油100万吨的呼和浩特炼油厂，目前正在做开工前的准备工作。
    根据国家能源规划布局，到本世纪末，内蒙古将建成7个动力煤基地，1个炼焦煤基地和1个出口煤基地，煤炭产量达1亿吨以上，将成为我国第二大煤炭基地。到2000年，围绕煤炭基地，将建成一批大型坑口电站群，发电装机总容量将达到1000万千瓦以上。　（魏友林）
