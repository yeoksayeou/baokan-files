Edition: 8

In May 1987, People's Literature Publishing House released the first installment of Wang Huo's serial novel "War and Man," titled "Moon Sets, Owls Cry, Frost Covers the Sky." This 560,000-word novel stirred strong reactions in the literary and reading communities. Wang Huo was the first editor-in-chief of Sichuan Literature and Art Publishing House. He spent his days buried in a mountain of manuscripts, only able to write in his spare time. Now, Wang Huo has retired, but he continues to write despite his illness. Recently, the second part of his "War and Man," titled "Maple Leaves and Reed Flowers in Autumn Chill," is also set to be published. Wang Huo is 63 years old this year. His hair is white, but he still has a handsome face and elegant manner of speech, embodying the demeanor and style of a scholar-writer. As early as the 1940s, he had published works in newspapers and magazines such as "Wenhui Daily," "Dagong Daily," "Shishi Xinbao," and "Wanshiang." In 1948, after graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University, he worked long-term in news and publishing, serving as an editor at Labor Publishing House, Workers Publishing House, and "China Workers" magazine, while also writing numerous feature articles and novels in his spare time. In the early 1960s, "China Workers" ceased publication, and he was sent to Shandong, where he served as a leader in a key provincial high school, Linyi No. 1 Middle School, for 17 years. It was also in Linyi No. 1 Middle School that Wang Huo encountered the decade-long turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and suffered inhumane torment!

On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, he submitted the serial novel "The Irretrievable Years," which he had written over more than 10 years, to China Youth Publishing House. The editor gave it high praise, calling it "a unique flower in the garden of a hundred flowers," and included it in the publishing plan. However, with the sudden onset of the Cultural Revolution, the novel not only could not be published but also brought disaster to Wang Huo, who was criticized for erecting monuments to the Kuomintang. Consequently, his manuscript was torn to pieces. When Wang Huo was finally released, the manuscript returned to him was incomplete. Wang Huo was filled with grief and anger, and in tears, he burned the manuscript in the ditch in front of his home. Unexpectedly, after the Gang of Four was smashed, Wang Huo suddenly received a manuscript request from People's Literature Publishing House. It was the original editor from "China Youth" who had moved to "People's Literature" and wrote to request the original manuscript. Upon learning that the manuscript had been destroyed, the editor from People's Literature Publishing House encouraged Wang Huo to rewrite the manuscript! Rewriting was no easy task! The 1.3 million-word manuscript, written over more than 10 years, required Wang Huo to lock himself away while others enjoyed leisure time. While others played cards and chatted, he tied himself to his desk and wrote. However, Wang Huo is Wang Huo. At the age of 55, he decided to emulate the spirit of the Ming-Qing historian Tan Qian, who rewrote the 108-volume Ming Dynasty annals "Guozhi." Tan Qian spent over 20 years writing "Guozhi" and another 10 years rewriting it. What perseverance! From January 1980 to October 1983, Wang Huo worked in a small house by the Yishui River in Shandong, with the lamp often burning until dawn. When the manuscript was completed, Wang Huo suddenly noticed that his hair had turned white. In the autumn of 1983, Wang Huo was transferred to Sichuan People's Publishing House as deputy editor-in-chief and soon took charge of Sichuan Literature and Art Publishing House. While reviewing over 30 million words of manuscripts, from 1984 to early 1985, he also revised and polished the novel, giving the first part, "Moon Sets, Owls Cry, Frost Covers the Sky," to People's Literature Publishing House. Just as he was writing the second part, "Maple Leaves and Reed Flowers in Autumn Chill," misfortune struck again. On a day in June 1985, Wang Huo jumped into a pit on a construction site to save a little girl, hitting his head and losing consciousness. After careful treatment by doctors, he gradually recovered and resumed writing. When he finished revising the novel, his condition worsened, and his left eye's retina detached, leaving him with only one right eye to read and write. Those who know Wang Huo all feel sorry for him, advising him to take care of his health and stop writing. However, a set of short stories by Wang Huo appeared in the third issue of "October" this year, an unimaginable feat for a writer with one eye! Works are a manifestation of a writer's character. In Shandong, Wang Huo dedicated "Foreign Guerrillas," "Bloodstained Spring and Autumn," and "A Tragic Tale of a Peking Opera Actress in the 'Eastern Venice'" to the people of the Yimeng revolutionary base area, as well as collections of medium and short novels. It was also in Shandong that he rewrote the serial novel "War and Man." In Sichuan, Wang Huo wrote and published the novels "Fiery Lights in the Fog" and "Snow Sacrifice." His "Moon Sets, Owls Cry, Frost Covers the Sky" won the Guo Moruo Literary Award.

    王火和他的书稿之火
    廉正祥
    1987年5月，人民文学出版社推出作家王火的系列长篇《战争和人》的第一部《月落乌啼霜满天》。这部56万字的长篇在文学界、读书界激起强烈反响。王火是四川文艺出版社的第一任总编辑。他每天埋头于如山的书稿堆中，只能利用业余时间写作。现在，王火已经离休，但仍在病中坚持写作。最近，他的《战争和人》的第二部《枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟》也要出版了。王火今年63岁，头发花白，但仍不失英俊的脸庞和儒雅的谈吐，处处体现出学者型作家的气质和风度。早在40年代，他就在《文汇报》、《大公报》、《时事新报》、《万象》等报刊发表作品了。1948年他从复旦大学新闻系毕业后，长期从事新闻出版工作，曾在劳动出版社、工人出版社、《中国工人》杂志担任编辑，业余时间撰写了大量特写、小说等作品。60年代初，《中国工人》停刊，他被下放到山东，在省属重点中学临沂一中担任领导职务达17年之久。也是在临沂一中，王火碰上了十年浩劫，遭受了非人折磨！
    文革前夕，他把花费10多年时间写成的系列长篇《一去不复返的年代》投寄中国青年出版社，编辑给予高度评价
  “这是百花园中一支独特的花”，列入了出版计划。文革狂飚骤起，长篇小说不但不能出版，反而给王火招来灾祸，被批判成为国民党树碑立传，继而书稿被撕毁。待王火解放，书稿退还他手中时，已残缺不全。王火悲愤交加，在家门前水沟里挥泪焚稿。殊不料，粉碎“四人帮”之后，王火突然收到人民文学出版社约稿信，是原“中青”社看过王火《一去不复返的年代》的编辑调到了“人文”，写信来索要原书稿。待知道书稿已毁时，人民文学出版社编辑鼓励王火将书稿重写出来！重写，谈何容易！洋洋洒洒130多万字，10余年时光，别人假日旅游欢聚，王火关起门写作；别人打扑克聊天，他把自己拴在桌子面前爬格子！不过，王火毕竟是王火，55岁的他，竟要学习明清之际史学家谈迁重写108卷明朝编年史《国榷》的精神。谈迁写成《国榷》花去20多年时光，重写《国榷》又用去10年光阴。何等的毅力！王火从1980年1月到1983年10月，在山东沂河边的一所小屋，夜夜灯光几乎亮到黎明。书稿完成时，王火骤然发现，头上增添了许多白发。1983年秋天，王火调任四川人民出版社任副总编辑，不久，又主持四川文艺出版社工作。他在终审3000多万字书稿的同时，从1984年到1985年初，又将长篇修改润色了一遍，将第一部《月落乌啼霜满天》给了人民文学出版社。正当他写第二部《枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟》的时候，不幸又降临王火头上。1985年6月的一天，王火在出版大厦基建工地跳进土坑救一位小女孩，自己头部撞伤，出现意识模糊。经医生精心治疗，他逐渐康复，又握笔写作。待他修改完长篇时，病情恶化了，左眼视网膜脱落，只有一只右眼视力伴他读书写字了。熟悉王火的人都在为他惋惜，劝他保养身体，别再写作了。可今年3期《十月》上又登出王火的一组小小说，难以想象，一只眼力的作家仍在辛勤笔耕！作品是作家人格的表现。在山东，王火为沂蒙老区人民奉献出《外国八路》、《血染春秋》、《“东方威尼斯”一个京剧女演员的传奇》等长篇小说和中短篇小说集。也是在山东，他重写了《战争和人》系列长篇。在四川，王火写作出版了长篇《浓雾中的火光》、《雪祭》等。他的《月落乌啼霜满天》荣获郭沫若文学奖。
