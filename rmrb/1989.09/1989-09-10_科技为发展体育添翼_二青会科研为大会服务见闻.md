The Second National Youth Games is not only a stage for athletic competition but also a field for scientific and technological workers to showcase their innovations. They move between various venues, providing new technological achievements to serve the event, earning widespread acclaim.

	It Can Help Improve Athletes' Psychological Qualities
	How to improve athletes' psychological qualities? Many sports teams are at a loss. At the shooting range of the Youth Games, a psychological testing device is placed to help solve some difficulties in psychological training. The device can measure over 30 data points, including a person's innate conditions and acquired states. It can more accurately measure data such as a person's emotions and fatigue levels. Athletes, following the instructions of the technicians, adjust their psychological states, and see quick results.

	Using the "Magic Wand" to Eliminate Athletes' Fatigue
	Fatigue is an obstacle to sports performance, and eliminating fatigue has become a research topic for many scientists. At some venues in Shenyang, a pen-like "magic wand" is being used to relieve athletes' fatigue. It is called an adjustable magnetic needle. By pointing the needle tip at acupuncture points, it can eliminate fatigue and relieve muscle soreness. This adjustable magnetic needle, invented and produced by Hou Shenggui and Wang Minying, is a combination of traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern scientific technology. It is developed based on the principle of combining the ancient nine needles with acupuncture point magnetic field therapy.

	Computers Show Their Magic
	The results bulletins for the Second National Youth Games are very timely. This is thanks to the efforts of scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Computing Institute. They provided a "Lianxiang-style Han card" and used a smaller but more powerful electronic computer than that used in the Sixth National Games to perform network operations. People can retrieve the competition results and related background materials of all athletes from any terminal at any time.

　　科技为发展体育添翼
    ——二青会科研为大会服务见闻
    第二届全国青运会，既是体育竞技的赛场，也是科技工作者的用武之地，他们往来于各大赛场，用新的科技成果为盛会服务，深受大家的欢迎。
      它能帮助提高运动员心理素质
    怎样提高运动员的心理素质？对此一些运动队不知从何下手。青运会射击场上放着一台心理测试仪，能帮助解决心理训练上的若干难题。心理测试仪可以测出人的先天情况和后天状况，共30多个数据。对人的情绪、疲劳度等数据测得更为准确。运动员根据科技人员的要求，进行心理调整，很快见效。
        用“魔棒”消除运动员疲劳
    疲劳是运动的障碍，消除疲劳已成为不少科研人员的课题。在沈阳一些赛场上，有一种形似钢笔的“魔棒”正在用来解除运动员的疲劳，它的名字叫可调磁鍉针。把这种魔棒的针头对准穴位就可消除疲劳、缓解肌肉酸痛。由侯升魁、王民英发明和生产的这种可调磁鍉针是中医理论和现代科学技术结合的产物，是根据古代九针与经穴磁场疗法相结合的原理研制而成的。
          计算机显神通
    二青会上成绩公报十分及时。原来是中国科学院计算所的科技工作者在帮忙。他们提供了“联想式汉卡”，用比第六届全运会容量更大的小型电子计算机进行联网工作。人们可以从任何一部终端机随时提取各赛场全部运动员的比赛成绩和有关背景材料。
