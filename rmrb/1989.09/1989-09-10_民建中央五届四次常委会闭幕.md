The fourth plenary session of the fifth central committee of the China Democratic League concluded today. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th, the meeting passed a resolution calling on all levels of the China Democratic League to continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and to continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one central task, two basic points" established by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The meeting also called for the completion of the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The resolution pointed out that at present, the China Democratic League should especially strengthen ideological and political work.

The resolution requires all levels of the China Democratic League to further properly handle the succession of the old and new leadership teams, and to strengthen the training, selection, and appointment of new cadres.

The meeting also passed the "Several Opinions on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Work" by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, the decision to hold the second plenary session of the fifth central committee in Beijing this year, and personnel appointment decisions.
