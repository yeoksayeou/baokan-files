Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th.

A red tide stretching approximately 20 kilometers long and 1 to 1.5 kilometers wide was discovered off the coast of Huanghua County, about 60 kilometers south of Tianjin's Tanggu. The red tide, which is only about 1 kilometer from the shore, appears as a brownish-red color.

Red tides occur when seawater becomes over-enriched with nutrients, leading to the rapid proliferation or aggregation of marine plankton, which in turn causes water quality to deteriorate. This ecological anomaly poses a direct threat to the lives of fish, shrimp, and shellfish. It is extremely rare for red tides to be observed in the Hebei region.

　　河北黄骅沿海发现带状赤潮
    本报北京九月十一日讯“中国海监”B3807飞机九月九日报告：在天津塘沽以南约六十公里处的黄骅县歧口发现长约二十公里、宽一至一点五公里的不规则带状赤潮。赤潮距岸仅一公里，呈棕红色。
    赤潮是海水富营养化，造成海洋浮游生物爆发性繁殖或聚集而引起水体变质恶化的生态异常现象，对鱼、虾、贝类生命会构成直接威胁。据了解，在我国河北一带发现赤潮是十分罕见的。（魏星）
