Socialist Cause Advances

Strive with Hard Work to Build Qinghai
Yin Kesheng, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the 40 years since the founding of New China, Qinghai's socialist construction has achieved tremendous success, and the face of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has undergone a dramatic transformation. The Qinghai of the past, plagued by warlords, chaos, vast deserts, and desolation, has today become a new development and construction base in the western part of the motherland that is rising rapidly. After 40 years of construction and development, Qinghai's economic structure and social development have undergone fundamental changes. Modern industry has gone from nonexistence to existence, transportation and telecommunications have continued to develop, urban and rural commerce and foreign trade have become increasingly active, and the national economy has broken away from the backward state of a single agricultural and pastoral economy, with economic strength significantly enhanced. From 1949 to 1988, the province's annual industrial output value, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 160 times, the total agricultural and pastoral output value was four times that of the pre-liberation period, and the output of major livestock products increased severalfold. The total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 16.03 times; in 1988 compared to 1951, local financial revenue increased by 127 times. The living standards of the people have improved significantly. In 1988, the per capita income of farmers and herdsmen reached 492 yuan, and the basic needs of the majority of farmers and herdsmen have been met. The clothing, food, housing, and daily necessities of the people have been significantly improved, and education, culture, health, and other undertakings have also developed considerably.

The rapid development of the economy has promoted the prosperity of various undertakings and laid the foundation for the large-scale development of Qinghai. Today, Qinghai has become one of the key areas for national development in the west. Qinghai is rich in resources, with rivers, desert basins, and vast grasslands, and is rich in resources. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reform and opening up have injected new vitality into Qinghai's economic development, not only raising Qinghai's productivity to a new level but also ushering in a new era of development and construction. In recent years, with the support and help of the state, a number of key engineering projects have been completed, and the development and utilization of hydropower, lake salt, petroleum, and mineral resources have made unprecedented progress. Looking to the future, the power industry centered on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the raw material industry centered on the development of resources in the Qaidam Basin, the salt chemical industry centered on the development of salt lakes, and the non-ferrous metal smelting industry, as well as the ethnic handicraft industry, livestock product processing industry, and highland tourism industry with plateau characteristics, all have broad prospects for development. In order to make full use of local resources and give full play to economic advantages, in recent years, while insisting on consolidating the agricultural and pastoral industry as the foundation, we have further adjusted the economic structure, accelerated resource development, focused on the development of resources, energy, raw materials, and local processing industries, strived to improve product quality, improve production technology and conditions, constantly adjust the product structure, actively develop horizontal cooperation, and promote the steady development of economic construction and development.

Reviewing the changes and developments in Qinghai over the past 40 years, we deeply feel that the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist road are the guarantee of our victory and the source of our strength. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, there would be no today for the people of Qinghai, nor would there be development and progress in Qinghai.

The history and experience of the past 40 years also tell us that in Qinghai, in order for the cause to develop, society to progress, and the people to become prosperous, we must highly value and earnestly strengthen national unity and must vigorously advocate and carry forward the spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship. The socialist construction of Qinghai is carried out under the conditions of low productivity, relatively backward economy and culture, and a very harsh natural environment. To enable the various ethnic groups in Qinghai to gradually embark on the road to prosperity and wealth, it is all the more important to adhere to national unity, hard work, and self-reliance. Therefore, we must unite as one, conscientiously implement the policies and guidelines of the central government, and do practical work and make contributions to the construction of Qinghai. We must always start from the actual situation of Qinghai, often pay attention to creatively combining the policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee with the actual situation of Qinghai, so that our policies, measures, and work steps are more in line with the actual situation of Qinghai and meet the wishes and requirements of the various ethnic groups in Qinghai. We must wholeheartedly serve the interests of the various ethnic groups in Qinghai. As long as we firmly adhere to the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and strive hard, there is great hope that Qinghai will soon become prosperous.

　　艰苦奋斗　建设青海
　　中共青海省委书记　尹克升
    新中国成立40年来，青海的社会主义建设事业取得了巨大成就，青海高原的面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。昔日军阀割据、兵荒马乱、遍地黄沙、满目疮痍的青海，今日已成为祖国西部的一个正在崛起的新的开发建设基地。经过40年的建设和发展，青海的经济结构和社会发展发生了根本性的变化。现代工业从无到有，交通、邮电事业不断发展，城乡商业和对外贸易日趋活跃，国民经济已经摆脱了单一的农牧业为主的自然经济的落后状态，经济实力明显增强。从1949年到1988年，全省年工业总产值按可比价格计算，增长160倍，农牧业总产值相当解放前的4倍，主要畜产品产量成倍增长，工农业总产值增长了16.03倍；1988年与1951年相比，地方财政收入增长了127倍。人民生活水平有了很大提高。1988年农牧民人均收入达到492元，大多数农牧民的温饱问题已经解决，群众的衣、食、住、用有了明显改善，教育、文化、卫生等事业也有了较大发展。
    经济的迅速发展，促进了各项事业蒸蒸日上，也为青海的大规模开发奠定了基础。今天的青海已成为国家西部开发的重点地区之一。青海地大物博，江河源头、戈壁盆地和千里草原，蕴藏着丰富的资源。党的十一届三中全会以来，改革开放给青海经济发展增添了新的活力，不仅使青海的生产力水平跃上了新的台阶，而且迎来了青海开发建设的新时期。近几年，在国家的支援和帮助下，一批重点工程项目相继建成，水电、湖盐、石油和矿产资源的开发利用取得了前所未有的进展。展望未来，以黄河上游为中心的电力工业，以柴达木盆地资源开发为中心的原材料工业，以盐湖开发为中心的盐化工业以及有色金属冶炼工业，富有高原特色的民族用品工业、畜产品加工业和高原旅游事业都具有广阔的开发前景。为了充分利用地方资源，发挥经济优势，近几年我们在坚持抓好农牧业这个基础的同时，进一步调整经济结构，加快资源开发，重点发展资源、能源、原材料和地方加工业，努力提高产品质量，改进生产技术和条件，不断调整产品结构，积极发展横向联合，推动经济建设和开发事业稳步发展。
    回顾青海40年来的历程和变化，我们深深感到，中国共产党的领导，社会主义道路，是我们胜利的保证，力量的源泉。没有中国共产党的领导，没有社会主义制度，就没有青海人民的今天，也不会有青海的发展和进步。
    40年来的历史和经验还告诉我们，在青海，事业要发展，社会要进步，人民要富裕，还必须高度重视和切实加强民族团结，必须大力提倡和发扬艰苦奋斗的创业精神。青海的社会主义建设，是在生产力水平很低、经济文化比较落后、自然环境十分艰苦的条件下进行的。要使青海各族人民逐步走上繁荣、富裕的道路，坚持民族团结、艰苦奋斗、奋发图强，更是具有特殊重要的意义。因此，我们必须团结一致，扎扎实实地贯彻落实中央的方针、政策，脚踏实地地为青海建设事业多做实事，多做贡献，坚持一切从青海的实际出发，经常注意创造性地把党中央的方针政策同青海的实际情况相结合，使我们的政策、措施和工作步骤更加符合青海的实际，符合青海各族人民的愿望和要求，全心全意为青海各族人民谋利益。只要我们坚定不移地贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，奋发努力，青海很快富裕起来是大有希望的。
