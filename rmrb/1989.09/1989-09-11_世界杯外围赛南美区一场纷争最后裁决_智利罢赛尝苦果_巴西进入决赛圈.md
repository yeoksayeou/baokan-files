The organizing committee of the World Cup held a meeting in Zurich yesterday to make a final decision on the unresolved dispute between the Brazilian and Chilean teams on September 3. The committee ruled that Brazil won the match 2:0 against Chile. On September 3, Brazil played against Chile in Rio de Janeiro in the final match of Group 3 in the South American qualifiers for the World Cup. When the match was in the 69th minute and Brazil was leading 1:0, a firework thrown from the stands injured Chile's goalkeeper, prompting the Chilean team to withdraw from the match and sparking a controversy.

The meeting, attended by FIFA Vice President Hermann Neuberger, emphasized the relevant regulations of the World Cup: if a team refuses to continue playing or leaves the field before the match ends, it will be deemed the loser, and the opposing team will be awarded a 2:0 victory. Based on this regulation, the meeting finally ruled that Brazil won the match. At the same time, Brazil was fined 20,000 Swiss francs for the fireworks thrown by their fans.

    世界杯外围赛南美区一场纷争最后裁决
　　智利罢赛尝苦果　巴西进入决赛圈
    新华社日内瓦9月11日电　（记者施光耀）世界杯足球赛组委会昨天在苏黎世召开会议对悬而未决的巴西—智利队9月3日之争作出最后裁决：判巴西队以2∶0战胜智利队。9月3日，巴西队在里约热内卢同智利队进行世界杯外围赛南美区第三组的最后一场比赛，比赛进行到第69分钟巴西队以1∶0领先时，智利队守门员被观众席上投下的烟火烧伤，智利队因此宣布退出比赛，从而引发了一场纷争。
    由国际足联副主席赫尔曼·诺伊贝格尔出席的这次组委会会议强调了世界杯赛的有关规定：如果某球队拒绝继续比赛或在比赛结束前离开赛场，那它将被判为失败者，对方球队将被判以2∶0获胜。根据这一规定，这次会议最后判巴西队获胜。同时，巴西也因球迷投的烟火而被罚款两万瑞士法郎。
