	China's tobacco industry has contributed 20.05 billion yuan in taxes and profits to the state over the past 40 years. This figure was revealed by Jiang Ming, General Manager of the China National Tobacco Corporation, in an interview with reporters.

	In the early days after liberation, China's cigarette production equipment was rudimentary, and hygiene and quarantine conditions were poor, allowing only the production of low-grade cigarettes. In 1950, the production volume was only over 1 million boxes, with an annual tax and profit of 280 million yuan. By 1988, cigarette production had reached 30.5 million boxes, with a tax and profit of 2.1 billion yuan, representing an increase of 18 times and 85 times respectively compared to the early days after liberation. Currently, China has 148 state-designated tobacco factories and 15 tobacco machinery and auxiliary material factories.

　　烟草生产四十年
　　上缴利税二千亿
    据新华社北京9月16日电　（记者杨理科、李晓岚）中国烟草业40年为国家提供税利2005亿元。这是中国烟草总公司总经理江明接受记者采访时透露的数字。
    解放初期，我国卷烟生产设备简陋，卫生、检疫条件很差，只能生产低档次的卷烟。1950年产量仅100多万箱，年税利2.8亿元。到1988年，卷烟产量达到3050万箱，实现税利210亿元，分别比解放初增长了18倍和85倍。目前，我国共有国家定点烟厂148家，15家烟草机械和配套材料厂。
