This spring, the Jinuo people of Baka Village invited us to celebrate the completion of a new house and drink together. Six years ago, when the famous singer Xia Du built the first tiled bamboo house in Baka Village, we were also invited to drink together. Since then, every year a few families build tiled houses, and this year it was Kongda's family who tore down the last thatched house in Baka Village and built a tiled bamboo house.

Baka Village is located on the hillside by the Manka River. The tiled bamboo houses stretch from the foot of the hill to the midway point. When we arrived at Kongda's house, the stairs were filled with people, all the way to the courtyard. The famous singer Xia Du was specially invited and sat by the fireplace.

Xia Du's songs took us back to the past years of the Jinuo people. Before liberation, the Jinuo people were still in the late stage of primitive communal society. They lived in large thatched houses. These large houses were rectangular, low, dark, and damp. All members of a patriarchal family lived together, with at least thirty to forty people, and up to eighty to ninety people. They worked from sunrise to sunset, shared meals, and divided everything equally.

After liberation, the patriarchal family system gradually disintegrated, and the large houses disappeared. However, the Jinuo people still lived in thatched houses.

The Jinuo people truly made a leap into the 21st century after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party. With the advancement of science and technology into this ancient mountain village, the Jinuo people, through planting sandalwood, tea, and rubber, shed their poverty. Last year, the per capita grain production was 579 kilograms, and the per capita income reached 623 yuan. Ten years ago, there were no tiled houses in the nine mountains and eighteen villages of Jinuo Mountain. Now, nearly half of the Jinuo people have moved into new homes. The village has built a small hydroelectric power station, constructed rural roads, and established a primary school, a semi-boarding junior high school, and a junior middle school. There are 36 college students per 10,000 people, exceeding the provincial average in Yunnan.

As we listened to Xia Du's songs and drank the fragrant corn wine, we were in a trance. This ancient ethnic group, crossing the threshold of the late stage of primitive communal society and moving towards socialism, from singing myths of floods to watching color television, from primitive slash-and-burn agriculture to relying on technology to become wealthy, all show the great elasticity of cultural change. The Jinuo people's today is not just a microcosm of the forty-year transformation of ethnic minorities in the border areas of Yunnan!

    在基诺人家作客
    今年春，基诺山巴卡寨的确达邀我们去贺新房喝酒。六年前女歌手夏都家在巴卡寨盖起了第一幢青瓦竹楼时，我们也被拉去喝酒。从那以后，每年都有几家盖瓦房，今年是确达家拆除了巴卡寨最后一幢茅草房盖起了青瓦竹楼。
    巴卡在曼卡小河畔的山坡上，青一色的青瓦竹楼从坡脚盖到山腰，我们到确达家，楼梯上排满了人，一直排到院场上。特地请来的女歌手夏都坐在火塘旁，她是基诺山有名的歌手。
    夏都的歌把我们带到基诺人的过去岁月。解放前，基诺人还处于原始公社的末期。住的是茅草盖的大房子。这种大房子呈长方形，低矮、阴暗、潮湿。一个父系家庭成员全都住在里面，少则三四十人，多则八九十人，日出而作，日落而息，有饭大家吃，东西平均分。
    解放后，父系家庭社会逐渐瓦解，大房子也随之消失。但基诺人住的还是茅草房。
    基诺山真正实现跨世纪的跳跃，是在党的十一届三中全会以后。随着科学技术飞进这个古老的山乡，基诺人靠种砂仁、茶叶、橡胶，摘掉了贫困的帽子。去年，人均有粮五百七十九公斤，人均收入达六百二十三元。十年前，九山十八寨的基诺山没有一幢农民住的瓦房，如今，近半数的基诺人已搬进了新居，乡里建了小水电站，修了乡村公路，全乡还办起了初级小学，半寄宿制高小和一所初级中学，每万人中有三十六个大学生，超过了云南全省的平均数。
    我们听着夏都的歌，喝着香醇的包谷酒，如痴如醉。这个古老的民族，跨过原始公社末期的门槛，向社会主义走来，他们从吟唱洪水神话到收看彩色电视，从原始刀耕火种到依靠科技致富，都显示出文化变迁的巨大弹性。基诺族的今天，不正是云南边疆少数民族四十年巨变的缩影吗！
