In the long historical process, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people to achieve tremendous victories in revolution and construction. Currently, the ten billion people of China, from the Great Wall to the Yangtze River, are bravely striving to realize the Four Modernizations, revitalize China, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. On this journey, there are smooth paths and rugged terrains, victories and challenges; to face severe challenges, one must summon unyielding strength to overcome difficulties. All of this has attracted the attention of the world. People want to know more about China, about China's yesterday and today. This large-scale photographic art album, "The Road," which combines documentary and artistic elements, authentically recreates the spirit of the Chinese people who have struggled for the Chinese revolutionary cause from different historical perspectives.

This album meticulously selects 187 photographs taken by the renowned photographers Xu Xiaobing and Hou Bo from the days of the Anti-Japanese War to the triumphant establishment of New China. Through these photographic lenses, one can see: on the banks of the Yanhe River, a group of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation gathered, with unshakable confidence and astonishing perseverance, they worked diligently, overcame unimaginable difficulties, learned, cultivated the land, trained soldiers, and marched to the battlefield; in the Taihang Mountains, soldiers and civilians shared a deep bond like family, united against the enemy, and were willing to sacrifice their lives to drive out the invaders and defend their homeland; during the peaceful liberation of Beiping, the Communist Party of China and democratic figures from various sectors discussed state affairs and national construction; after the proclamation of the founding of New China at the founding ceremony, central leaders frequently interacted with and had cordial conversations with prominent figures from China and abroad, as well as representatives from the scientific, educational, news, cultural, religious, and worker-peasant sectors... These thought-provoking historical scenes sketch out a path to victory where Marxism is combined with Chinese realities. On this extraordinary journey, one will surely witness the heroic deeds of countless martyrs and survivors and their pursuit of ideal goals.

The two photographers, Xu Xiaobing and Hou Bo, have each been engaged in photography for over half a century. Their works cover a broad range of subjects, including politics, military, culture, and life. Most of the works included in this photographic album are being published for the first time. To capture these precious and vivid historical scenes, they braved harsh weather, worked day and night, and even risked their lives to photograph on the front lines. These works embody the authors' hardships, aspirations, and achievements, serving as both authentic historical records and artistic creations, and will inspire new insights.

It is hoped that the publication of this large-scale photographic art album will be welcomed and understood by people from all walks of life both domestically and internationally.

    历史的艺术画卷
    ——大型历史文献画册《路》序
    中共中央文献研究室
    在漫长的历史进程中，中国共产党领导中国人民取得了革命和建设的巨大胜利。当前，长城内外、大河上下的十亿中国人民，正在为实现四化、振兴中华、建设有中国特色的社会主义而英勇奋斗。在前进的道路中，有坦途也有崎岖，有胜利也有困难；要迎接严峻的挑战，更要拿出坚韧不拔的力量去克服困难。这一切，已经引起全世界的瞩目。人们要求更多地了解中国，了解中国的昨天和今天。这本文献性和艺术性相结合的大型摄影艺术画册
  《路》，从历史的不同侧面，真实地再现了曾经为中国革命事业艰苦奋斗的中国人民的精神面貌。
    这本画册，精选了著名摄影家徐肖冰和侯波伉俪从抗日烽火燃烧着的土地上，到建立新中国的凯歌声中拍摄的187幅照片。从这些摄影镜头中可以看到：在延河之滨，集合了一群中华民族的优秀儿女，他们以必胜的信心，惊人的毅力，脚踏实地，克服了难以想象的困难，学习、开荒、练兵、走向战场；在太行山区，军民深情亲如家人，他们同仇敌忾，生死与共，不惜牺牲生命，赶走了侵略者，保卫了自己的疆土；在北平和平解放时，中国共产党人和各界民主人士共商国是，研讨建国大计；在开国大典上宣告新中国成立之后，中央领导人与中外知名人士，同科学界、教育界、新闻界、文化界、宗教界、工农代表等各方面的人士频繁接触，亲切对话……这一幅幅发人深思的历史画面，勾划了一条马克思主义与中国实际相结合的走向胜利的道路。在这条不平凡的道路上，人们定会看到无数牺牲者和幸存者的可歌可泣的壮举和他们追求理想目标的心灵。
    徐肖冰和侯波两位摄影家，从事摄影生涯均逾半个世纪。他俩的摄影作品，取材极其宽广，既有政治、军事的内容，又有文化、生活的丰采。收入这本摄影画册的大部分作品系第一次公开发表。为了这些珍贵、生动的历史画面，他俩冒着严寒酷暑，披星戴月，实地抓拍，甚至不顾生命危险，亲赴作战前线拍摄。这些作品集聚了作者的艰辛，蕴藏着作者的追求和造诣，既是历史的真实纪录，又是艺术的精心创造，将给人们带来新的启迪。
    希望这本大型摄影艺术画册的问世，能够博得海内外各界人士的理解和欢迎。
