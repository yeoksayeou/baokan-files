The Central Military Commission Song and Dance Troupe presented a new song and dance performance titled "Oh, Red Star" on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The performance participated in the national military arts festival and the second Chinese Art Festival.

The red star embodies the military spirit—on the flag of the Republic, there is the splendor of blood shed by soldiers. For such a sacred theme, artists with a solemn sense of mission delve into war and history, composing their hearts' songs with grand and tragic melodies.

The opening dance "The Flag of the Republic" is vast and magnificent. The poetic structure and expressive nature vividly display the soldiers' loyalty to the motherland. The deep affection under the flag of the Republic, checking the motherland, all of these highlight the unique charm of soldiers. If the opening dance is merely a declaration of the theme of this song and dance, if the red and yellow costumes of the leading dancers are only a rough symbol of the original colors of the flag, then as the evening unfolds, the soprano and male chorus "Eternal Star Spirit" shockingly tell people about the value of soldiers. This segment is performed by the familiar and beloved singer Dong Wenhua. Her round, sweet, and expressive voice, under the deep and resonant male chorus, contrasts gently, pouring this heavy burden, this passionate emotion, into the hearts of the audience.

The two sides, each with four red flags, form a three-dimensional side curtain. The shining red stars at the top are the overall design of the entire stage. The director of "Blood Variations" uses a giant red flag that spans the stage, organically promoting the theme of the entire song and dance, and expanding the performance space on the stage. They, through this space and layout, miraculously push the performance area closer to the audience. That giant red flag not only creates a grand stage atmosphere but is also cleverly divided by the director into several close-up shots: one by one, the heroic soldiers line up under the red flag, team after team of brave soldiers struggle forward, sometimes it's a half-body bust of vigor, sometimes it's a marching step. The hoarse voice, the mournful melody, the modern collision rhythm, in the original life cry, a group of soldiers—the survivors of war—rush onto the stage. Their love and pursuit are all fully expressed in this free-form dance from the heart.

A platform loaded with flowers rises from the depths of the stage. Soprano singer Peng Liyuan sings "Mother's Sun" with a clear and pure voice, telling stories of the countryside, the village by the river, the distant rainbow, the smoke curling around the thatched cottage, and the mother waiting at the bridgehead. The sincere singer softly expresses the soldiers' wishes: for the white hair and kind face of countless mothers, soldiers shoulder rifles and march to the battlefield. The dance "Moonlight Song" tells many touching stories that happened under the moonlight. Here, the director attempts to recreate the imagery of the song "The Fifteenth Moon" through dance. However, he does not take the shallow approach but quietly picks up the soldiers' few thoughts. The director captures the emotion, intentionally downplaying the narrative, using large segments of expressive and free-form dance to trace the journey of contemporary soldiers' hearts and actions.

The final chorus "Red Star Ode—The Republic Will Not Forget" is magnificent, pushing the entire evening to its climax. It breaks through the general praise song style, with the main section showcasing the true emotions of military artists. They sing about the "military spirit condensed on the red star," revealing endless affection. The four lines of lyrics "The Republic will not forget, the older generation will not forget, the new era will not forget, the descendants will not forget" are sung one by one from the depths of the soul by the singers Cheng Zhi and Wang Xiufen, with a vast vocal range. Their leading singing with grand momentum and the high-pitched and passionate four-part chorus in a progressive exchange, deeply render and deepen the theme, igniting the emotions of the entire audience. This fiery soldier's song stirred the tides of people's hearts.

　　红星凝铸着军魂
    ——观总政歌舞团歌舞《啊，红星》
　  王曼力
    总政歌舞团于共和国四十年大庆前夕，推出一台全新的歌舞《啊，红星》，参加全军文艺调演和第二届中国艺术节。
    红星凝铸着军魂——共和国的旗帜上有军人血染的风采。为了这样一个神圣的命题，具有庄严使命感的艺术家们走进战争，走进历史，以雄伟悲壮的旋律谱写他们心中的歌。
    开场舞蹈《共和国的旗帜》气势博大恢宏，诗化的结构与写意性，酣畅地展现了军人忠诚祖国的内心世界，那在共和国旗帜下请祖国检阅的深情，无一不在渲染着军人独特的风采。如果说开场舞蹈还只是宣告这部命题歌舞的主旨，如果说红衣与黄衣领舞者还只是粗疏地象征国旗的原色，那么随着晚会的呈示展开，女高音与男声合唱《永恒的星魂》就惊心动魄地告诉人们军人的价值。这一段是由观众熟悉而喜爱的歌唱家董文华演唱的，她那圆润甜美富有表现力的歌喉，在浑厚深沉的男声烘托下，以柔情似水的反衬，把这份沉重，这种壮怀激烈的情，汩汩地流到观众的心底。
    两边各四面红旗构成的立体侧幕，顶端交相辉映的闪闪红星是全台的整体设计，《血的变奏》的编导者运用横贯舞台的巨幅红旗，既有机地弘扬了整部歌舞的主旨，又把舞台的表演空间拓展开来。他们凭借这空间，这格局，竟然奇妙地把表演区域向观众推近了。那幅横贯全台的红旗不单制造了大气磅礴的舞台氛围，还被编导者机智地分切成若干特写镜头：一个个英武的士兵在红旗下列队，一队队骁勇的战士艰难的跋涉，忽而是英姿勃发的半身胸像，忽而是步履铿锵的行进。嘶哑的嗓音，悲怆的曲调，现代撞击的节奏，在充满了原发性的生命呐喊中，一群战士——战争的幸存者们拥到舞台上，他们的爱与追求，都在这段发自内心的随意性舞蹈里得到了尽情的抒发。
    载满鲜花的平台从舞台深处升起来了，女高音歌唱家彭丽媛以清丽真纯的声情，娓娓地歌唱《妈妈的太阳》。听着她的歌，人们仿佛回到故乡，回到童年，村边弯弯的小溪，远天七色的彩虹，萦绕在草屋上的缕缕炊烟，等待在桥头望眼欲穿的妈妈……真情的歌唱家柔婉地道出了战士的心愿：为了千万个妈妈的白发和慈颜，军人才扛起钢枪走上战场。舞蹈《月亮之歌》向观众叙述着多少个月夜里发生的多少个动人的故事。在这里，编导者尝试着以舞蹈形象再现歌曲《十五的月亮》的意境。然而他不做浅显地直取，只是悄然地采撷了其间军人的几许情思。编导抓住了情，有意淡化叙事，以泼墨般地大段抒情与写意性舞蹈，去追踪当代军人心灵和行为的历程。
    最后的合唱《红星颂——共和国不会忘记》是辉煌的，把整场晚会推向了高潮。它突破了一般的颂歌曲式，主段以军人艺术家的真情见长，他们歌唱“红星上凝聚着的军魂”，流露出连绵不绝的情意。那点题的四句唱词“共和国不会忘记，老一辈不会忘记，新时代不会忘记，子孙们不会忘记”，一任歌唱家程志、王秀芬一泻千里的广阔音域一个字一个字地从心灵深处射出，他们领唱的宏大气魄与高亢激越的四部合唱递进式的交替，浓烈地渲染了主题，深化了主题，把全场观众的感情点燃起来了。这首炽热的兵之歌，掀动了人们心灵的潮汐。（附图片）
