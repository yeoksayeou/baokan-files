The fields of Hebei in August once again present a scene of bountiful harvests. Since ancient times, the land of Yan and Zhao has been renowned for its agriculture and has been a coveted region for military strategists. Nearly 40 years have passed since the founding of New China. What is the current situation? As an old Hebei resident would say: Despite having gone through various twists and turns, the path of agriculture has become smoother over the past 10 years since the reform and opening up. It is like a massive project that has laid a solid foundation and is now rising layer by layer.

In 1988, the province's total grain production reached 20.2 billion kilograms, an increase of 15.35 billion kilograms from 4.85 billion kilograms in 1949. Among these, the total wheat production increased from 900 million kilograms in 1949 to 7.922 billion kilograms in 1988, and reached 8.58 billion kilograms in 1989. Cotton, oil crops, and forestry and animal husbandry have all shown a trend of year-on-year growth.

Since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, the reform in rural areas has continued to deepen—establishing a socialized service system throughout the province. After several years of effort, the province has initially formed a multi-layered, diversified socialized service network. Many places have improved their community-based service organizations, making the service work move towards institutionalization and standardization. A total of 8,281 various professional associations and 10,235 various professional cooperatives have emerged, providing farmers with one-stop production, supply, and sales services, becoming friends and helpers for farmers' production development. These innovative service organizations, combined with the household contract responsibility system, have opened up broad prospects for further developing rural productivity.

Farmers' demand for technology has become more urgent. Through technological system reforms, various levels of leadership have implemented the "two liberations" policy for science and technology, sending more than 40,000 scientific and technological personnel to rural areas to showcase their talents. They have optimized and integrated conventional technologies, creating technological achievements such as model cultivation of wheat and corn. Various levels of leadership have continuously summarized experiences, promoting the development from single-technology contracting to comprehensive technology contracting, and from scientific and technological personnel working alone to a three-in-one approach involving technology, administration, and material departments. This has resulted in multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental, and multi-industry technology contracting groups. Not only has this ensured the implementation of technical measures, but it has also ensured the implementation of production materials for technical measures. Currently, there are 1,700 such contracting groups across the province. Since last autumn's wheat planting, 56 counties have developed wheat technology contracting groups, further implementing various technical measures for wheat increase. This year, the province's total wheat production reached an all-time high. Farmers say that the scientific and technological personnel deserve the credit!

To consolidate the development of science and technology in rural areas, many counties have recruited talented individuals and appointed science and technology deputy county magistrates. This group of officials with scientific and technological qualifications has thrived like fish in water and is doing a great job.

At the same time, as a resource development project to enhance the momentum of agriculture, it has risen in the land of Yan and Zhao. Through the efforts of the people of the entire province over the past few years, nearly 10 million mu of wasteland and tidal flats have been developed, turning former wastelands and tidal flats into croplands, and fish and shrimp farming in depressions and tidal flats. This not only compensates for the arable land occupied by various constructions since the founding of the nation but also adds follow-up resources for agricultural development. At the same time, on the already transformed land, family farms with moderate-scale operations have emerged, pushing farmers' land operation methods to a new stage.

While Hebei farmers are developing underground water resources, they are also ensuring safety during the flood season and making good use of floodwater to turn harm into benefit. In 1988, the province utilized nearly 7 billion cubic meters of water from reservoirs, depressions, ponds, and canals. While opening up water sources, the province has also focused on saving water. Measures such as "pipe water conveyance," "anti-seepage ditches," "large ridges to small ridges," sprinkler irrigation, and drip irrigation have been promoted from point to surface. Various places in the province have also worked hard on scientific irrigation. According to relevant departments, the implementation of these water-saving measures can save 700 million cubic meters of water each year.

Officials working in Hebei generally understand that if they do not firmly grasp agriculture, they will have wasted their efforts. Despite the province's tight fiscal situation, they have resolutely reduced other expenditures to ensure agricultural investment. In recent years, the funds used for agriculture have increased year by year, and this year, 50 million yuan has been allocated to support agriculture. At the same time, they educate farmers to carry forward the spirit of hard work, thrift, and family management, and actively invest in agriculture. In 1988, the total production investment of rural households in the province reached 5.42 billion yuan, with an average of 109.36 yuan per person. This spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship will surely bear more abundant fruits as the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee is thoroughly implemented in Hebei!

### 燕赵农业向高层伸展

    燕赵农业向高层伸展
    8月的河北田野，又呈现一派丰收在望景象。
    自古以来，燕赵大地以农业著称，是兵家争夺之地。新中国建立快40年了，如今的景况如何？用一位老河北人的话来说：尽管曾走过这样那样曲折的道路，改革开放后这10年农业的路子越走越顺，就像一座巨大的工程，已打好牢固的基础，正一层层升起。
    1988年全省粮食总产量达到202亿公斤，比1949年的48.5亿公斤增长153.5亿公斤。其中，小麦总产量由1949年的9亿公斤增长到1988年的79.22亿公斤，1989年又达到85.8亿公斤。棉花、油料及林牧业都呈现逐年增长的趋势。
    农村陆续实行以家庭联产承包为主的农业生产责任制以来，农村的改革不断引向更深的层次——在全省建立社会化服务体系。经过几年的努力，全省农村已初步形成多种层次、服务多样的社会化服务网络。不少地方的社区性服务组织通过不断完善，使服务工作向制度化、规范化发展。由农民自己建立起来的8281个各种专业协会和10235个各种专业合作社涌现出来，向农民提供产供销一条龙服务，成为农民发展生产的朋友和助手。这些创新的服务组织与家庭联产责任制相配套，为进一步发展农村生产力开拓了广阔前景。
    农民对科技的渴望更加迫切。各级领导通过科技体制改革，落实科技“双放”方针，全省有4万多名科技人员走向农村这个广阔天地大显身手。他们把常规技术优化组合、配套组装，创造出小麦、玉米等模式化栽培等项科技成果。全省各级领导通过不断总结经验，推动单项技术承包向综合技术承包发展，由科技人员孤军作战向技术、行政、物资部门三位一体发展，产生了多专业、多部门、多行业的技术承包集团。不仅保证了技术措施的落实，而且保证了实施技术的生产物资的落实。目前，全省各种承包集团已达1700个。从去秋种麦开始，全省仅小麦技术承包集团就已发展到了56个县，使小麦增产的各种技术措施得到进一步落实。今年全省小麦总产量创历史最高水平。农民说，应当给科技人员记头功！
    为了巩固科技在农村的发展，许多县招贤纳士，配备了科技副县长，这批有科技素质的干部，如鱼得水，干得蛮欢。
    同时，作为增强农业后劲的资源开发工程，在燕赵大地上兴起。经过全省人民近几年的努力，已开发荒地、荒滩近千万亩，使昔日的荒地、荒滩长出了庄稼，洼淀、滩涂放养了鱼虾。这不仅补偿了建国以来各种建设占用的耕地，也为农业的发展增加了后续资源。同时，在已经改造的土地上，出现了适度规模经营的家庭农场，把农民的土地经营方式推向了一个崭新阶段。
    燕赵农民在开挖地下水资源的同时，在保证汛期安全的前提下，搞好汛期蓄水，变害为利。1988年全省利用水库、洼淀、坑塘、渠道等蓄水近70亿立方米。开源不忘节流，全省开展了节水工作。“管道输水”、“防渗垄沟”、“大畦改小畦”、喷灌、滴注等节水措施，已由点向面推广。全省各地还在科学浇水上狠下功夫。据有关部门匡算，这些节水措施的实施，每年可节约用水7亿立方米。
    在河北任职的干部大多深深懂得，如果不紧紧抓农业，等于白混一场。尽管省里财政吃紧，他们坚决压缩其他开支，保证农业投入。近年，使用于农业的资金逐年增加，今年又拿出5000万元支持农业。同时，教育农民发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭持家的精神，积极向农业投入资金。1988年，全省农户生产投资总额达54.2亿元，人均109.36元。这种艰苦创业的精神，必将随着党的十三届四中全会精神的深入贯彻，在河北大地上结出更丰硕的成果！
