The southern part of Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is experiencing a strange disease in the Soignes Forest, threatening over eighty thousand oak trees with death.

The oak trees infected with this strange disease first turn yellow and shed their leaves prematurely, followed by the bark cracking and the tree dying. Currently, over five hundred ancient oak trees in the Soignes Forest have been affected by this disease. Experts have pointed out that if no measures are taken, all the oak trees in the forest may die within ten years.

This strange forest disease first appeared two years ago in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Federal Republic of Germany, and has since been spreading continuously.

Scientists have not yet determined the cause of the disease, but it is believed to be related to acid rain and pollution. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　比利时森林怪病
    比利时首都布鲁塞尔南部的苏瓦涅森林正在流行一种怪病，八万多株橡树面临死亡威胁。
    染上这种怪病的橡树先是叶子萎黄，提前脱落，然后树皮龟裂而死。目前，苏瓦涅森林中已有五百多株百年老橡树染上了此病。专家们指出，如不采取措施，森林里所有橡树将在十年内全部死亡。
    这种森林怪病两年前首先在比利时、荷兰和联邦德国出现，此后便一直在不断蔓延。
    科学家们目前还未找到发病原因，但据说酸雨和污染与此不无关系。　（新华社）
