    The rectification of the construction market has seen initial success. The next steps will focus on eliminating "touts," combating bribery, and investigating illegal operations.

    Today, the Ministry of Construction, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, the Audit Office, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Construction Bank held a nationwide teleconference in Beijing to rectify the construction market. A responsible official from the Ministry of Construction reported on the progress of the rectification of the construction market nationwide.

    Since the Ministry of Construction issued the "Notice on Rectifying the Order of the Construction Market" in December last year, the rectification work has gradually been carried out nationwide. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the progress has been even faster. Some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have already handled a number of important cases, and the serious disorder in the construction market has begun to be reversed.

    According to incomplete statistics from six provinces and regions, including Shanghai, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Hunan, a total of 1,045 cases of various illegal activities have been handled. Among these, 144 cases involved bribery, 242 cases involved illegal subcontracting of projects, and 659 cases involved selling certificates, operating without a license, or subcontracting projects beyond the authorized level. Ma Zhiwu, deputy director of the Construction Bureau of the Heilongjiang Coal Industry Corporation, took advantage of his position to accept kickbacks totaling 20,000 yuan and was expelled from the Party and removed from his post for investigation. Dong Fujin, deputy general manager of Shanghai Shengang Construction Co., Ltd., used the opportunity to accept bribes totaling more than 100,000 yuan and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In Shenzhen, a construction bribery case involving 28 people and a total of 120,000 yuan was uncovered. The two main culprits, Zhong Zhibiao and Duan Shuizhen, have been handed over to the judicial authorities. Zhu Ji, an official of the Guangzhou Urban Planning Bureau, used his power to approve project construction plans to demand a bribe of 650,000 yuan in one instance and was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.

    However, the rectification work in the construction market has been uneven, with some regions starting late and moving slowly; some regions have taken ineffective measures and have not handled cases decisively. In this regard, the Ministry of Construction pointed out that all levels of construction authorities must take this work as a key task to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session.

    The responsible official of the Ministry of Construction pointed out that the next step in the rectification work will focus on eliminating "touts," combating bribery, and investigating illegal operations. Regardless of who is involved or which unit is involved, all illegal activities must be resolutely investigated and handled. It is not allowed for any illegal operating units or individuals to benefit and go unpunished.

    建设市场整顿初见成效
    下一步重点是整“倒”治贿清查违法经营
    本报北京9月5日讯　记者朱剑红报道：今天，建设部、国家计委、监察部、审计署、国家工商局、建设银行等6个部门在京联合召开全国整顿建设市场电话会议。建设部负责人通报了全国建设市场的整顿情况。
    自去年12月建设部发出《关于整顿建设市场秩序的通知》后，建设市场整顿工作在全国逐步展开，党的十三届四中全会以后，进展更快。一些省、市、自治区已查处了一批重要案件，建设市场的严重混乱局面开始得到扭转。
    据上海、新疆、辽宁、山东、黑龙江、湖南等6个省区的不完全统计，已经查处各类违法案件1045起，其中行贿受贿144起，非法转包工程242起，出卖证件、无证和越级承包工程659起。黑龙江省煤炭联合公司基建局副局长姚志武，借主管基建工作之便，收受回扣2万元，被开除党籍，撤职查办。上海市申港建筑有限公司副总经理董福金利用发包工程之机，收受贿赂10万余元，被判处无期徒刑。深圳市的一起工程建设行贿受贿案，涉及28人，金额达12万元，两名主犯钟志彪、段水珍已被移送司法机关。广州市规划局干部朱基，利用审批工程报建的权力，一次索贿6.5万元，被判死缓。
    但是，建设市场的整顿工作开展很不平衡，一些地区布置较晚，动作缓慢；一些地区措施不力，查处不果断。对此，建设部指出，各级建设主管部门必须把这项工作作为落实四中全会精神的突出工作来抓。
    建设部负责人指出，下一步整顿工作的重点是整“倒”治贿，清查违法经营。问题不管涉及什么人、什么单位，都必须坚决查处，决不能让各种违法经营的单位和个人得到好处，逍遥法外。
