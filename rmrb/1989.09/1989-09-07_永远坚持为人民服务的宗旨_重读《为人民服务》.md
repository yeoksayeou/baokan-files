45 years ago, at a gathering held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yan'an to commemorate the communist warrior Zhang Side, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a famous speech titled "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Since then, the idea of completely and thoroughly serving the people, as proposed in this speech, has educated and cultivated generation after generation of communists and revolutionary fighters who have dedicated themselves to the people's interests, and has had a tremendous spiritual impact on the people of all ethnic groups across the country. Today, as we revisit this speech, we deeply feel that it remains as relevant and instructive for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people who are striving together for the modernization of socialism.

Serving the people, these five simple and unadorned words, encapsulate the fundamental principle of our party. Over the past half century, our party has led the people in democratic revolutions, socialist revolutions, and socialist construction, and now in the great cause of the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up. For what purpose? It is for the independence, freedom, prosperity, and strength of the Chinese nation, and for the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China. Marx and Engels pointed out in the Communist Manifesto that communists "have no interests separate and apart from those of the whole proletariat." Therefore, our party has always regarded the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people as its own fundamental interests. It has always stood firmly with the Chinese people and regarded serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly as the starting point and ultimate goal of all its actions, and has required every party member and cadre to do the same. From Zhang Side to Lei Feng, from the exemplary county party secretary Jiao Yulu to the "Two Bombs Hero" Deng Jiaxian, from the heroes on the front lines of Laoshan to the "Guardians of the Republic" who suppressed the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, they all consciously practiced the fundamental principle of serving the people, dedicating everything to the motherland and the people, and earning the party high prestige among the masses.

However, it must be noted that over a period of time, some party members, including party cadres, have not fully upheld this fundamental principle. For example, some prioritize personal interests over the interests of the people, considering their own private gains first when faced with a situation; some seek comfort and enjoyment, no longer willing to struggle hard for the people; and some have seen their individualism grow to the point of using power for personal gain, forgetting righteousness for profit, seeking fame in the court and profit in the market, and even committing crimes. All these are incompatible with the principle of serving the people and are deeply detested by the broad masses of the people. The recent turmoil in Beijing, fundamentally speaking, was determined by the international and domestic climates and was inevitable. However, why so many people were involved in this turmoil is worth pondering. It should be noted that, apart from a few people who plotted and incited bourgeois liberalization, an important reason is that some party members and cadres have deviated from the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, corrupting party discipline and social ethics, and damaging the party's image among the people. This is indeed a wake-up call.

Why has this situation arisen? Some comrades attribute it to the fact that our country is still in the primary stage of socialism. This is obviously unconvincing. In the 1950s and early 1960s, our socialist society was even more "primary" than it is now, but at that time, party discipline and social ethics were quite good, and serving the people was considered a virtue of the new society. Some comrades blame the emergence of some corrupt phenomena within the party on reform and opening up, which is also unfounded. Reform and opening up do not contradict the party's principle of serving the people; on the contrary, it reflects the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups across the country. Implementing reform and opening up is to vigorously develop the socialist economy while, through strengthening ideological and political work and democratic and legal supervision, overcoming and eliminating various corrupt phenomena, and striving for the common progress of socialist spiritual and material civilization. If reform and opening up necessarily lead to the collapse of the spiritual pillar and the degradation of morality, then why bother with reform and opening up? The emergence of some corrupt phenomena in the process of reform and opening up is due to various complex reasons, including historical accumulation, the infiltration of decadent foreign ideas, the damage caused by the ten years of turmoil to party building and party discipline, and the fact that the restraint mechanism is not yet perfect. More importantly, over a period of time, due to the influence of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's erroneous guiding ideology, party building and ideological and political work have been weakened, leading some party members and cadres to relax their self-discipline and dilute the concept of serving the people. This lesson is profound.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee proposed the important task of strengthening party building. The facts tell us that in the new situation, strengthening party building must always adhere to the party's fundamental principle and educate all party members, especially party cadres at all levels, to continuously strengthen the concept of serving the people.

To adhere to the principle of serving the people, we must firmly and unswervingly implement the party's basic line. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, our party, based on the summary of historical experience and the actual situation of socialist modernization construction, has re-established the correct line of Marxism, whose basic content is to take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to the general policy of reform and opening up. Practice has proven that this basic line concentrates the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people, and is the hope and future of our country and nation. When we talk about serving the people, we must never forget the fundamental interests of the people and must not deviate from the party's line, away from our overall goals and directions. At present, we must particularly clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization. In the previous period of turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, those who engaged in bourgeois liberalization raised the banner of "speaking for the people" and claimed to be representatives of the people's interests. In fact, they could not represent workers, peasants, or intellectuals. In today's China, the true representatives of the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country are not them, but the Communist Party of China. As communists, only by loyally striving to realize the party's line can we make the due contributions to the motherland and the people.

To adhere to the principle of serving the people, we must resolutely resist the infiltration of bourgeois decadent ideas and overcome and eliminate various corrupt phenomena. As the ancient poem goes: "The flowers are gradually blinding the eyes." Now, indeed, many party members and cadres have been blinded by the "flowers" of bourgeois decadent ideas in the new situation, and even their hearts have been confused. In their minds, there is no place for the party's interests or the people's interests; revolutionary ideals and the future of the motherland are not on their minds. How can such a spiritual state possibly serve the people wholeheartedly? Corruption is a cancer growing on the body of our party. Now, the Central Committee has decided to take decisive and effective measures to eradicate corruption, which is deeply in line with the people's wishes. To eradicate corruption, we need institutions, legal systems, and ideological education, and the awakening of the broad masses of party members and cadres. Of course, corruption is not only within the party but also in society. However, it is mainly within the party. As long as corruption within the party is eliminated and party discipline is rectified, there is hope for improving social ethics.

To adhere to the principle of serving the people, we must also genuinely improve our ideological and work styles and truly work diligently for the interests of the masses. Serving the people is not an empty slogan. For our party members, especially cadres, it is not enough to just keep oneself clean and "cultivate oneself." We must also actively work, strive, and strive to benefit the broad masses and achieve "benefiting all under heaven." In this regard, we must particularly pay attention to preventing and overcoming the bureaucratic style of being detached from reality and the masses. We must strengthen the concept of "public servant" and advocate the spirit of closely connecting with the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and striving together. Now, some party members and cadres only care about their own enrichment and do not care about the cold and warmth of the surrounding masses, how can this be acceptable?

In the essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our cause will definitely prosper." Today, we can also confidently say that as long as we persist in the fundamental principle of serving the people, our cause will definitely prosper even more.

    永远坚持为人民服务的宗旨
    ——重读《为人民服务》
    吕志勋
    45年前，在延安中共中央直属机关为纪念共产主义战士张思德而举行的集会上，毛泽东同志发表了题为《为人民服务》的著名演讲。从那时起，这篇讲话中提出的完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，教导和培育了一代又一代为人民利益前仆后继、忘我奋斗的共产党人和革命战士，在全国各族人民中产生了巨大的精神影响。今天重新学习这篇讲话，我们深深感到，它对于正在为社会主义现代化事业共同奋斗的中国共产党和中国人民，依然是那样亲切，那样富有教益。
    为人民服务，这五个朴实无华的大字，集中概括了我们党的根本宗旨。半个多世纪以来，我们党领导人民进行民主革命，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，直到现在进行四化建设和改革开放的伟大事业，为的是什么呢？就是为了中华民族的独立自由、繁荣富强，为了中国各族人民的根本利益。马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中曾经指出，共产党人“没有任何同整个无产阶级的利益不同的利益”。正因为如此，我们党始终把无产阶级和最广大的人民群众的根本利益看作是自己的根本利益，把紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务作为自己一切行动的出发点和归宿，并以此要求每一个党员和干部。从张思德到雷锋，从县委书记的好榜样焦裕禄到“两弹元勋”邓稼先，从老山前线的英雄到这次制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱中的“共和国卫士”，他们都自觉实践了为人民服务这一根本宗旨，把自己的一切无私地奉献给了祖国和人民，使党在人民群众中赢得了崇高的威信。
    但是不能不看到，一个时期以来，在少数党员包括党的干部中间，党的这一根本宗旨并没有得到很好的坚持。例如，有的摆不正个人利益和人民利益的位置，一事当前，首先考虑的不是如何为人民办事，而是一己的私利；有的贪图安逸，追求享受，不再愿意为人民艰苦奋斗；更有的个人主义恶性膨胀，以权谋私，见利忘义，争名于朝，争利于市，甚至因此走上违法犯罪的道路。凡此种种，都是同为人民服务的宗旨不相容的，也是为广大人民群众所深恶痛绝的。不久前北京发生的风波，从根本上说是由国际大气候和国内小气候决定的，是不可避免的。但是为什么会有那么多群众卷入这场风波，却值得我们深思。应当看到，除了极少数搞资产阶级自由化的人阴谋策划煽动外，一个不可忽视的原因，就是由于少数党员和干部的思想和行为离开了全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，败坏了党风和社会风气，损害了党在人民群众中的形象。这一点确实令人警醒。
    为什么会出现这种情况？有的同志认为，这是由于我国还处在社会主义初级阶段的缘故。这显然是缺乏说服力的。五十年代和六十年代初期，我们的社会主义社会比现在还“初级”，但那时的党风和社会风气相当好，为人民服务被公认为是新社会的美德。也有的同志把党内出现一些腐败现象归咎于改革开放，这同样是缺乏根据的。改革开放同坚持党的为人民服务的宗旨并不矛盾；恰恰相反，它本身就反映了全国各族人民的根本利益。实行改革开放，就是要在大力发展社会主义经济的同时，通过加强思想政治工作，加强民主和法律监督，克服和消除各种腐败现象，争取社会主义精神文明和物质文明建设的共同进步。如果说改革开放必然导致精神支柱的崩溃，必然导致道德的沦丧，那我们还要搞改革开放干什么呢？在改革开放过程中出现一些腐败现象，原因很复杂，这里有历史的积淀，有外来腐朽思想的侵蚀，有十年内乱对于党的建设和党风的破坏，也有约束机制还不够完善的因素。而更重要的，则是一个时期以来，由于赵紫阳同志错误指导思想的影响，党的建设和思想政治工作遭到了削弱，致使少数党员和干部放松了对自己的要求，淡化了为人民服务的观念。这一教训至为深刻。
    党的十三届四中全会提出了加强党的建设的重要任务。事实告诉我们，在新的形势下加强党的建设，必须始终坚持党的根本宗旨，教育全体党员、特别是党的各级干部不断增强为人民服务的观念。
    坚持为人民服务的宗旨，首先要坚定不移地贯彻执行党的基本路线。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党在总结历史经验的基础上，从社会主义现代化建设的实际出发，重新确立了马克思主义的正确路线，其基本内容就是以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的总方针。实践证明，这一基本路线集中反映了我国工人阶级和广大人民群众的根本利益和愿望，是我们国家和民族的前途所系，希望所在。我们讲为人民服务，任何时候都不能忘记人民的根本利益，不能脱离党的路线，偏离我们的总目标、总方向。在当前，我们特别要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。在前一时期的动乱和反革命暴乱中，那些搞资产阶级自由化的人打着“为民请命”的旗号，标榜自己是人民利益的代表者。其实，他们既不能代表工人、农民，也不能代表知识分子。在今天的中国，真正代表全国各族人民根本利益的，不是他们，而是中国共产党。作为共产党员，只有忠心耿耿地为实现党的路线积极奋斗，才能为祖国为人民作出应有的贡献。
    坚持为人民服务的宗旨，必须坚决抵制资产阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀，克服和消除各种腐败现象。古人有诗云：“乱花渐欲迷人眼。”现在，确实有不少党员和党的干部，在新形势下被资产阶级腐朽思想的“乱花”迷惑了眼睛，甚至迷惑了心窍。在他们心目中，什么党的利益、人民的利益，统统没有位置；什么革命的理想，祖国的前途，一概不在心上。这样的精神状态，怎么可能全心全意为人民服务呢？腐败现象是长在我们党的肌体上的一个毒瘤。现在党中央已经下了决心，要采取坚决有力的措施根治腐败现象，这是深得民心的。根治腐败，要靠制度，靠法制，也要靠思想教育，靠广大党员和干部觉悟的提高。当然，腐败现象不仅仅党内有、社会上也有，但主要是在党内。只要党内的腐败现象消除了，党风端正了，社会风气的好转也就有希望了。
    坚持为人民服务的宗旨，还应当切实改进思想作风和工作作风，真正勤勤恳恳地为人民群众谋利益。为人民服务不是一句空洞的口号。对于我们的党员特别是党的干部来说，仅仅做到洁身自好、
  “独善其身”是不够的，还要通过积极工作，奋发进取，努力为广大人民谋利益，做到“兼善天下”。在这方面，尤其要注意防止和克服那种脱离实际，脱离群众的官僚主义作风。要强化“公仆”的观念，提倡紧密联系群众、和群众同甘共苦、团结奋斗的精神。现在有的党员和干部只顾自己发家致富，而不关心周围群众的冷暖疾苦，这怎么能行呢？
    在《为人民服务》这篇著作中，毛泽东同志说过：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”今天，我们同样可以满怀信心地说，只要我们永远坚持为人民服务这一根本宗旨，我们的事业就一定会更加兴旺起来。
