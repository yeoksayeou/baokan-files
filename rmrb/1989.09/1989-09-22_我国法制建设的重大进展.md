Under the guidance of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, significant progress has been made in China's legal system construction over the past decade. China has formulated a new constitution, enacted 146 laws and relevant decisions on legal issues (497 administrative regulations, 1220 local regulations), bringing the country's political, economic, and social life to the track of rule of law, ending the situation of "no law to rely on" in major aspects.

	Formulated a New Constitution with Chinese Characteristics
	The new constitution formulated in 1982 is a good constitution and the foundation of China's socialist legal system. It legally affirms the achievements of the long-term struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in China in the 20th century, and affirms the four cardinal principles. It has made a series of important provisions for the development of socialist democracy and the improvement of the socialist legal system, stipulating the basic rights and duties of Chinese citizens, stipulating the unity and authority of the legal system; it has made a series of important provisions for China's political system reform, improving and perfecting the people's congress system; it has made a series of important provisions for China's socialist economic system, affirming that the socialist public ownership of the means of production is the foundation of China's socialist economic system.

	The new constitution reflects the common aspirations and demands of the people of all ethnic groups in China and has been widely supported by the whole country. However, precisely because of this, this constitution has been opposed by a small number of people who adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance. They have been attacking the new constitution in various ways, and in order to achieve their goal of "political pluralism and economic privatization," they have been advocating the need to remove the four cardinal principles from the constitution. The preamble of the new constitution states: "All ethnic groups in the country, all state organs and armed forces, all political parties and social organizations, all enterprises and institutions must take the constitution as the fundamental norm of their activities, and have the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the constitution and ensure its implementation." Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the publicity of the constitution, so that the majority of cadres and the masses can understand that not only should they abide by the constitution, but more importantly, they should consciously struggle to ensure the implementation of the constitution.

	Formulated a Relatively Complete Criminal Legal System
	In 1979, China formulated the first criminal law and criminal procedure law since its founding. Subsequently, the "Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Military Personnel for Dereliction of Duty," the "Decision on Handling Escaped or Newly Offending Prisoners and Re-educated Persons," the "Decision on Severely Punishing Serious Economic Crimes," the "Decision on Expediting the Trial of Serious Criminals Endangering Social Order," the "Supplementary Provisions on the Punishment of Bribery," and the "Supplementary Provisions on the Punishment of Smuggling" were formulated, and some articles of the criminal law were amended and supplemented. In addition, in the Patent Law, Trademark Law, Forest Law, and other laws, provisions were made to pursue criminal responsibility according to or in accordance with the relevant articles of the criminal law for acts constituting crimes, expanding the scope of application of the relevant articles of the criminal law.

	The formulation of the criminal law and the above laws has formed a relatively complete criminal legal system in China, playing an important role in punishing crimes, protecting the interests of the people and the state, and consolidating and developing a stable and united situation. The current task is to further solve the problems of "having laws but not enforcing them, enforcing laws but not strictly, and violating laws but not investigating them," and to correct the erroneous practice of using party discipline, administrative discipline, or administrative penalties by administrative departments to replace criminal penalties in some places, so as to maintain the seriousness and authority of the law.

	Civil Laws Have Taken Initial Shape
	The General Principles of Civil Law formulated in April 1986 is the basic law of China's civil laws. This law stipulates that civil law adjusts the property relationships and personal relationships between citizens as equal subjects, between legal persons, and between citizens and legal persons. Its promulgation and implementation have played an important role in promoting the development of China's socialist commodity economy.

	The General Principles of Civil Law, together with the individual civil laws formulated before and after it, such as the Inheritance Law, Marriage Law, Economic Contract Law, Foreign Economic Contract Law, and Technology Contract Law, have made China's civil laws take initial shape. Of course, some laws, such as the Copyright Law, are still urgently needed. With the development of reform and opening up, China's civil laws will become more complete.

	The Laws of State Organs Are Basically Complete
	The constitution stipulates the establishment of state organs, including the National People's Congress, the State Council, local people's congresses and local people's governments at various levels, people's courts, and people's procuratorates, all of which have formulated special organizational laws. In addition, the Election Law and the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy have been formulated. The implementation of these laws has played an important role in improving the organizational system and work system of state organs and in improving democratic life.

	A Batch of Important Economic and Administrative Laws Have Been Formulated, but This Aspect Is Still Incomplete, and the Legislative Tasks in the Future Are Still Arduous. To Adapt to the Needs of Reform and Opening Up, and to Use Legal Means to Manage the Economy, the National People's Congress and Its Standing Committee Have Always Taken the Formulation of Economic Laws as the Focus of Legislative Work. In the Laws Formulated by the National People's Congress and Its Standing Committee, Economic Laws Account for About Half.

	To Strengthen the State's Unified Supervision and Management of Economic Work, the Statistics Law, Accounting Law, Metrology Law, and Standardization Law Have Been Formulated; To Adapt to the Needs of Opening Up to the Outside World, the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law on Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures, the Law on Foreign-Funded Enterprises, the Law on Income Tax of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law on Income Tax of Foreign Enterprises, the Individual Income Tax Law, the Patent Law, the Trademark Law, the Law on the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, the Customs Law, and the Regulations on the Special Economic Zones of Guangdong Province Have Been Formulated; To Adapt to the Needs of Economic System Reform and the Development of Socialist Commodity Economy, the Law on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and the Law on the Bankruptcy of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People Have Been Formulated; To Strengthen the Protection and Utilization of Natural Resources, the Forest Law, Grassland Law, Fisheries Law, Mineral Resources Law, Land Management Law, Water Law, and Wildlife Protection Law Have Been Formulated; To Protect the Environment, the Environmental Protection Law (Trial), Marine Environmental Protection Law, Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law, and Atmospheric Pollution Prevention and Control Law Have Been Formulated; To Protect the Health of the People, the Food Hygiene Law (Trial), Drug Administration Law, Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law, and Border Health Quarantine Law Have Been Formulated.

	However, the laws in this area are still far from meeting the needs of reform and opening up. Some important laws, such as the Labor Law, Company Law, Banking Law, and Budget Law, are urgently needed and are being drafted by the relevant departments.

	Although China has formulated some laws in the fields of education, science and technology, and culture, such as the Compulsory Education Law, Cultural Relics Protection Law, and Degree Regulations, the legislative work in this area is still weak and needs to be accelerated and drafted urgently.

	Based on the practical experience of the past decade, we have realized: First, legislative work must be based on the constitution and guided by the four cardinal principles. Second, an active and cautious approach must be adopted. Laws are the crystallization of policies proven by practice, and legislative work must be approached with a very active attitude, and important laws must be grasped, but those issues that are not mature and lack confidence should not be hastily formulated. Only in this way can the stability, continuity, and great authority of the law be guaranteed. Third, legislation must start from China's actual situation and cannot be based on subjective wishes or blindly copy foreign things, but at the same time, good experiences from foreign countries should be learned from. Fourth, legislation must rely on the collective wisdom and experience of various localities, departments, and the majority of cadres and the masses, and listen to the opinions of all parties, and take different opinions seriously. We will, on the basis of the major achievements made in the past decade, continue to strive for the establishment of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics.

    我国法制建设的重大进展
    宋汝棼
    在党的十一届三中全会的精神指导下，十年来我国法制建设取得了重大进展。我国制定了新宪法，制定了146个法律和有关法律问题的决定（497个行政法规，1220个地方性法规），使国家的政治生活、经济生活、社会生活的主要方面结束了无法可依的状况，走上了法制轨道。
        制定了一部具有中国特色的社会主义新宪法
    1982年制定的新宪法是一部好宪法，是我国社会主义法律体系的基础。它以法律形式确认了我国各族人民二十世纪以来长期奋斗的成果，确认了四项基本原则，它对发展社会主义民主、健全社会主义法制作了一系列重要规定，规定了我国公民的各项基本权利和义务，规定了法制的统一和法制的权威；它对我国的政治体制改革作了一系列重要规定，健全和完善了人民代表大会制度；它对我国社会主义经济制度作了一系列重要规定，肯定了生产资料的社会主义公有制是我国社会主义经济制度的基础。
    新宪法反映了我国各族人民的共同愿望和要求，得到了举国上下的普遍拥护。但是，正因为如此，这部宪法一直遭到极少数坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人的反对。他们对新宪法百般攻击，为了达到其“政治多元化、经济私有化”的目的，一直鼓吹必须把四项基本原则从宪法中修改掉。新宪法序言中指出：“全国各族人民、一切国家机关和武装力量、各政党和各社会团体、各企业事业组织，都必须以宪法为根本的活动准则，并且负有维护宪法尊严、保证宪法实施的职责。”因此，必须进一步做好宪法的宣传工作，使广大干部和群众认识到，不仅要遵守宪法，更重要的是，要自觉地为保证宪法的实施而斗争。
                制定了比较完整的刑事法律
    1979年，制定了我国建国以来的第一部刑法和刑事诉讼法。之后又制定了惩治军人违反职责罪暂行条例、关于处理逃跑或者新犯罪的劳改犯和劳教人员的决定、关于严惩严重破坏经济的罪犯的决定、关于迅速审判严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子的决定、关于惩治贪污罪贿赂罪的补充规定、关于惩治走私罪的补充规定，对刑法的一些条款作了修改和补充。此外，还在专利法、商标法、森林法等法律中，对构成犯罪的行为，作了依照或者比照刑法有关条款追究刑事责任的规定，扩大了刑法有关条款的适用范围。
    刑法和上述法律的制定，使我国刑法形成了一个比较完整的体系，对惩治犯罪，保护人民和国家的利益，巩固和发展安定团结的局面，起了重要作用。当前主要是进一步解决有法不依、执法不严、违法不究的问题，纠正有的地方存在的用党纪、政纪处分或者行政主管部门的行政处罚代替刑罚的错误做法，以维护法律的严肃性和权威。
                  民事法律已经初具规模
    1986年4月制定的民法通则是我国民事法律的基本法。这个法规定了民法调整做为平等主体的公民之间、法人之间、公民和法人之间的财产关系和人身关系。它的颁布实施，对我国社会主义商品经济的发展起到了重要的推动作用。
    民法通则加上在这前后制定的单行民事法律如继承法、婚姻法、经济合同法、涉外经济合同法、技术合同法等，使我国的民事法律初具规模。当然，有的法律如版权法还亟待制定。随着改革、开放的发展，我国的民事法律将更加完备。
              国家机构方面的法律基本齐备
    宪法规定设立的国家机构，包括全国人大、国务院、地方各级人大和地方各级人民政府、人民法院、人民检察院，都制定了专门的组织法。此外，还制定了选举法、民族区域自治法。这些法律的实施，对健全国家机构的组织制度和工作制度，健全民主生活，起了重要作用。
    制定了一批重要的经济法和行政法，但是这方面的法律还不完备，今后的立法任务还很繁重。为了适应改革、开放的需要，运用法律手段管理经济，十年来，全国人大和它的常委会一直把制定经济方面的法律作为立法工作的重点。在全国人大和人大常委会制定法律中，经济方面的法律约占一半。
    为了加强国家对经济工作的统一监督管理，制定了统计法、会计法、计量法、标准化法；为了适应对外开放的需要，制定了中外合资经营企业法、中外合作经营企业法、外资企业法、中外合资经营企业所得税法、外国企业所得税法、个人所得税法、专利法、商标法、进出口商品检验法、海关法、广东省经济特区条例等；为了适应经济体制改革和发展社会主义商品经济的需要，制定了全民所有制工业企业法、全民所有制企业破产法等；为了加强对自然资源的保护和利用，制定了森林法、草原法、渔业法、矿产资源法、土地管理法、水法、野生动物保护法等；为了保护环境，制定了环境保护法（试行）、海洋环境保护法、水污染防治法、大气污染防治法等；为了保护人民健康，制定了食品卫生法（试行）、药品管理法、传染病防治法、国境卫生检疫法等。
    但是，这方面的法律还远远不能适应改革、开放的需要，有些重要法律如劳动法、公司法、银行法、预算法等亟待制定，有关部门正在抓紧起草中。
    我国虽然在教育、科技、文化方面制定了一些法律如义务教育法、文物保护法、学位条例等，但是这方面的立法工作仍然很薄弱，亟需加快步伐，抓紧制订。
    根据十年来的实践经验，我们体会：第一，立法工作必须以宪法为根据，以四项基本原则为指导思想。第二，必须采取积极慎重的方针。法律是实践证明是成熟的政策的定型化，对立法工作一定要采取十分积极的态度，对重要的法律尤其要抓紧，但对那些不成熟的、没有把握的问题不能仓促制订。只有这样，才能保证法律的稳定性、连续性和极大的权威。第三，立法要从我国的实际情况出发，不能凭主观愿望，不能照搬、照抄外国的东西，但同时要借鉴外国的好的经验。第四，立法要依靠各地方、各部门和广大干部群众的集体智慧和经验，广泛听取各方面的意见，要认真对待不同的意见。我们要在十年来取得重大成就的基础上，再接再厉，为建立有中国特色的社会主义法律体系而奋斗。
