    Over the past 40 years since liberation, Hunan Province has relied on self-reliance and hard work to build a number of new industrial sectors and key enterprises. In 1988, the total output value of heavy industry was 589 times that of 1949, accounting for 54.7% of the province's total industrial output value.

    Before liberation, Hunan's industrial foundation was very weak. The province's total industrial output value was only 3.18 billion yuan, of which heavy industry accounted for only 0.54 billion yuan. Over the past 40 years, Hunan Province has consistently focused on developing heavy industry in the areas of energy, raw materials, and agricultural support industries. Coal development has broken through the "no coal in Jiangnan" stereotype, with the province's proven coal reserves reaching over 30 billion tons. In 1988, coal production reached 35.61 million tons. The electric power industry has grown from an installed capacity of 13,500 kilowatts at the beginning of liberation to 4.61 million kilowatts in 1988, a 340-fold increase over 1949. In recent years, with strong support from the state, Hunan Province has focused on the construction of "two water" (Dongjiang and Wuqianxi Hydropower Stations), "two fire" (Leiyang and Yueyang Thermal Power Plants), and "one line" (Gezhouba to Zhuzhou power transmission line). The completion of these projects will significantly improve Hunan's long-standing lagging electric power industry.

    In the raw materials industry, the focus has been on developing black, non-ferrous, chemical, and building materials industries. Before liberation, Hunan produced only 3,000 tons of crude iron annually. Currently, the province's steelmaking, ironmaking, rolling, metal products, and ferroalloy production capacities are 1.42 million tons, 1.44 million tons, 1.43 million tons, 33,000 tons, and 156,000 tons, respectively. Hunan's manganese ore production accounts for one-third of the national total, and Xiangtan Manganese Mine is the largest high-furnace ferromanganese production base in the country. Hunan is known as the "home of non-ferrous metals," with a comprehensive advantage from exploration, design, construction, mining, selection, smelting, processing, to scientific research and teaching. Six mining products rank first in the country in terms of production and export earnings, and ten non-ferrous metal products rank second in the country.

    Hunan's petrochemical industry has also developed since liberation, forming 12 industries including petroleum refining, petrochemicals, chemical mining, basic chemical raw materials, fertilizers, pesticides, three major synthetic materials, fine chemicals, inorganic salts, rubber processing, and chemical machinery, capable of producing over 700 petrochemical products. After decades of construction and development, Hunan's machinery industry has grown from a focus on repairs and lack of manufacturing capabilities at the beginning of liberation to become the province's largest pillar industry, gradually forming regional advantages and characteristic products in electrical, railway machinery, mining and mining transportation hoisting equipment, construction machinery, textile machinery, and small agricultural machinery.

    The continuous development of heavy industry has driven the formation and development of various characteristic central cities in Hunan Province. Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan have become the province's raw material industry and mechanical manufacturing cities. Yueyang has become a petrochemical city, Hengyang has become an agricultural machinery manufacturing center, Loudi and Lengshuijiang have become energy and raw material industry bases, and Chengzhou and Zixing have become energy and non-ferrous metal industry bases. With the adjustment of the industrial structure, Hunan's heavy industry advantages will be further fully utilized, strongly promoting the sustained, stable, and healthy development of the province's national economy.

    湖南重工业发展迅速
    40年增长近六百倍
    本报讯　解放40年来，湖南省靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗，建设起一批新兴工业部门与骨干企业，1988年重工业总产值比1949年增长589倍，占全省工业总产值的54.7％。
    解放前的湖南，工业基础十分薄弱，全省工业总产值仅3.18亿元，其中重工业产值仅0.54亿元。解放40年来，湖南省始终把发展重工业的重点，放在能源、原材料和支农工业上。煤炭开发突破了“江南无煤论”的框框，全省探明煤炭储量为30多亿吨，1988年产煤3561万吨。电力工业由解放初期装机容量1.35万千瓦，发展到1988年的461万千瓦，比1949年增长340倍。近几年来，在国家大力支持下，湖南省狠抓了“两水”（东江、五强溪水电站）、“两火”（耒阳、岳阳火电厂）、“一条线”（葛洲坝至株洲输变电线路）建设。这些项目建成后，将使长期落后的湖南电力工业大为改观。
    在原材料工业方面，重点发展了黑色、有色、化工和建材工业。解放前，湖南只年产土铁3000吨。目前，全省的炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、金属制品和铁合金的主要设备生产能力分别达到142万吨、144万吨、143万吨、3.3万吨和15.6万吨。湖南省锰矿开采量占全国总产量的1／3，湘潭锰矿是全国最大的高炉锰铁生产基地。湖南被誉为“有色金属之乡”，具有从勘探、设计、施工到采矿、选矿、冶炼、加工和科研、教学相互配套的综合优势。六种矿山产品产量和出口创汇均居全国第一位，十种有色金属产量居全国第二位。
    湖南的石油化学工业也是解放后发展起来的，现已形成了石油炼制、石油化工、化学矿山、基本化工原料、化肥、农药、三大合成材料、精细化工、无机盐、橡胶加工、化工机械等12个行业，能生产700多种石化产品。湖南机械工业经过几十年的建设和发展，从解放初期以修配为主，不具备制造能力，发展成为全省目前最大的支柱行业，逐步形成了电工、铁路机械、矿山开采及工矿运输起重设备、建筑机械、纺织机械、小型农业机械等地区优势和特色产品。
    重工业的不断发展，带动了湖南省各具特色中心城市的形成和发展。长沙、株洲、湘潭三市已成为全省的原材料工业和机械制造工业城市，岳阳市已成为石油化工城，衡阳市已成为农业机械制造中心，娄底和冷水江市已成为能源、原材料工业基地，郴州与资兴市已成为能源、有色金属工业基地。随着工业结构的调整，湖南重工业的优势将进一步充分发挥出来，将有力地推动全省国民经济持续、稳定、健康地向前发展。
