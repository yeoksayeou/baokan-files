	This past summer, in Beijing, a storm that started as a student protest and escalated into a riot caught most good-hearted people off guard. The turmoil reached Jilin Chemical Industry Company, located by the Songhua River, which also felt the impact. Despite the crowds outside the company gates shouting "Jilin workers, come out!" and "Jilin workers, strike!", the workers at Jilin Chemical remained steadfast. The company's operations, including production, work, study, and life, continued smoothly and orderly. Not a single Communist Party member from Jilin Chemical participated in the street protests. Even under the dual pressures of the turmoil and shortages of electricity, materials, and funds, Jilin Chemical achieved outstanding results in the first half of the year, with both production value and tax revenue surpassing the same period last year.

	"Ask the river why it is so clear, for it has a source of living water." As the first chemical industry base built during the country's first Five-Year Plan, Jilin Chemical has always prioritized ideological and political work. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, this work has been elevated to a new level.

	The sewage treatment plant has a driver known as a "fashionable youth." In 1985, he bravely rescued three children from icy water, an act that caused a sensation. The company's leadership seized this opportunity to organize a discussion throughout the company on what to learn from this young man. In the fertilizer plant and the public utilities company, some party members had lost their vanguard and exemplary roles, leading the masses to complain, "We are no different from party members except that we don't pay party dues!" This criticism caught the attention of the leadership, prompting a vigorous campaign this past winter and spring to "establish the image of party members"...

	It is through these lively, vibrant, and vivid main melody educations that the basic line of "one center, two basic points" has deeply entered the hearts of Jilin Chemical workers, enabling the company's two civilizations to be perfectly combined. Not only have Jilin Chemical workers passed the severe political test, but they have also strongly promoted the company's reform, opening up, and production and construction. In 1988, compared to 1978, the company's production value increased by 205%, and tax revenue increased by 221%. Over the past decade, the average annual growth rate of production value has been 11.8%, and the average annual growth rate of tax revenue has been 12.4%. Now, Jilin Chemical has developed into a large-scale petrochemical enterprise group with a national ownership system as its main body, spanning regions and industries, and is one of the top ten enterprises in the country.

	Recently, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government held a learning-from-Jilin Chemical on-site conference at the company and issued a decision on deepening the learning-from-Jilin Chemical campaign. "One flower blooms, and all flowers follow." It can be expected that more Jilin Chemical-like enterprises and units will emerge on the land of Jilin.

    两个文明一起抓的企业—吉化公司
    常莎　肖南
    今年初夏，北京，一场由学潮发展成暴乱的狂风，在大多数善良的人们毫无精神准备的情况下猝然而起。风波所至，地处松花江之滨的吉林化学工业公司也受到了猛烈冲击。然而，尽管游行的人群在吉化公司门口一再高叫“吉化人出来！”“吉化罢工！”，吉化人仍然不为所动，吉化城固若金汤，生产、工作、学习、生活依然按照正常的轨道有序地进行，吉化的共产党员无一人上街游行。在动乱加缺电、缺料、缺资金的非常困难的情况下，吉化公司创造了今年上半年产值、利税双超去年同期的出色战绩。
    “问渠那得清如许，为有源头活水来。”作为国家第一个五年计划期间兴建的全国第一个化学工业基地，三十多年来，吉化公司一贯重视抓思想政治工作；党的十一届三中全会以后，思想政治工作更上一层楼。
    污水处理厂有一个被人视为“时髦青年”的汽车司机，一九八五年，他奋不顾身从冰水中救出三个小孩。这事引起了轰动。公司领导抓住这一典型事例，在全公司组织了向这位青年“学什么”的大讨论。在化肥厂、公用事业公司，由于某些党员失去了自己的先锋模范作用，群众不满地说：“我们和党员就差没交党费了！”群众的批评引起了领导的注意，于是，去冬今春，一场“树立党员形象”的教育有声有色地开展起来……正是通过一次次生动、活泼、形象的主旋律教育，使“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线深入吉化人心中，使吉化公司的两个文明建设恰到好处地结合起来，不仅吉化人能经受住严峻的政治考验，而且有力地推动了吉化公司的改革、开放和生产建设。全公司一九八八年与一九七八年相比，实现产值增长百分之二百零五，利税增长百分之二百二十一；十年来平均每年递增产值百分之十一点八，递增利税百分之十二点四。现在，吉化公司已发展成为以公司全民所有制企业为主体的跨地区、跨行业的大型石油化工企业集团，是全国十大企业之一。
    最近，中共吉林省委和省政府在吉化公司召开了向吉化学习现场会，并作出了关于深入开展向吉化学习活动的决定。“一朵忽先变，百花皆后香。”可以预期，在吉林大地，将会有更多的吉化式企业和单位出现。
