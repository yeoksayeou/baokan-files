In the county of Wenxi, Shanxi Province, there is a well-known pig farming cooperative. It is famous because its members were once debt-ridden poor households, but now they are all wealthy households with annual incomes of over ten thousand yuan. Their leader is Yang Zhenxin, a representative of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress and a provincial labor model.

	Bravely Taking on the "Delicate Task"

Eight years ago, one night, the courtyard of the Small Horse Village Committee in Wadiping Town, Wenxi County, was brightly lit. Villagers were bidding on the collective's sideline stalls. Six brick kilns and one flour processing plant were the hot items, while the pig farm was the "delicate task" that no one dared to take on because it had always been losing money.

In the end, pig farming expert Yang Zhenxin took on this "delicate task." The officials repeatedly warned, "If you take it, you must not back out." Yang Zhenxin said, "If I dare to take it, I will definitely not back out." That night, he signed a 10-year contract with the village and paid the annual contract fee of 1,400 yuan.

The contract was signed, but the large operation could not be managed by one household alone. Yang Zhenxin found a milling expert, but the person was unwilling to do it. He then found a wealthy household, but he also hit a snag. Usually calm Yang Zhenxin was filled with anger. He vowed: those with skills and money do not want to do it, so find the poor households. He quickly found four poor partners. These four households were all in debt, with the most indebted owing 1,800 yuan and the least indebted owing 750 yuan. Yang Zhenxin leading the poor to manage the pig farm immediately became "news," and some people even said:

	"Wait until he loses the pig farm's capital."

Yang Zhenxin, however, said:

	"Others laugh at us for being poor and unable to succeed in business. I believe that as long as we have the spirit and determination to work hard, the pig farm will definitely be successful."

A few words made the poor partners feel warm at heart.

In front of them were: three dilapidated brick houses, five earthen caves, ten rotten pig pens, and 16 emaciated pigs. Facing this situation, they bravely took on the challenge, raising 3,000 yuan to build a new wall, adding 50 piglets, and purchasing two new-type milling machines and other production tools. They insisted on taking the road of breeding, raising, and processing in one go. Processing starch, feeding the pigs with the starch residue, and using the pig manure as fertilizer, by the end of the year, they sold 75 commercial pigs to the state, with a total annual profit of 6,960 yuan, averaging 750 yuan per household, with the remaining amount left as working capital. Bundles of "big notes," these few households had never seen before. Everyone was overjoyed, and even in their dreams, they laughed out loud.

	Hard Work Plus Science

The following spring, as the earth thawed and everything revived, when the pig farm was expanding rapidly, a pig epidemic suddenly took the lives of more than 30 pigs overnight, and the rest were also in danger. The heavy blow made everyone panic, and Yang Zhenxin was particularly heartbroken, guarding the pigsty day and night to save the sick pigs. One night, it was already past 9 o'clock, and he had not yet returned home for dinner. His wife ran to the pig farm and found him busy giving pigs medicine and injections. She shed tears and said, "Zhenxin, you are really foolish, working so late and not going home for dinner." "How can I afford to eat? Look, these few pigs are seriously ill." Until 2 a.m., Yang Zhenxin dragged his tired body home, entered the door, and collapsed on the bed.

	Learning from Mistakes

After that, Yang Zhenxin not only worked hard but also strove to study scientific knowledge related to pig farming. He bought books such as "Pig Farming" and "Pig Disease Prevention and Treatment," and also visited Xi'an and Lanzhou to learn from others, mastering scientific feed formulation and disease prevention and treatment. That year, the pig farm not only did not collapse but also sold more than 100 commercial pigs to the state, with a stock of 100 pigs, and a pure income of 120,000 yuan. At the end of the year, Yang Zhenxin and the four households discussed and paid the entire 10-year contract fee of 15,500 yuan to the village in advance.

	Standing Firm

With a solid foundation, the pig farm absorbed five more poor households. The operation expanded, and the number of people increased. Yang Zhenxin introduced a competitive mechanism and risk mechanism to implement a responsibility system. Everyone had a task, and each person took on a heavy burden. After 8 years of hard work, the breeding scale continued to expand, with annual output value increasing from 6,300 yuan to 210,000 yuan, an increase of more than 30 times. The former dilapidated pig pens were rebuilt into 64 new-style three-separation pig pens, and last year, heating and ventilation equipment were installed. These modern facilities shortened the pig raising cycle from 10 months to 6 months. The fixed assets of the pig farm increased from the original 2,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan.

	The Pursuit of a Communist Party Member

Over the past 8 years, Yang Zhenxin's pig farm has provided the state with 3,000 commercial pigs. They have a principle when selling pigs: only sell to the state, not to individuals; only sell at the state-set price, not at a higher price. In 1986, pig production decreased, and the state had difficulty purchasing, while market meat prices rose. Under these circumstances, they consecutively sold 360 live pigs to the state. Just this one item, when calculated carefully, would result in nearly 200,000 yuan less income compared to direct market sales. Some people in society laughed at Old Yang for being "foolish," and some in the farm said he was too stubborn, but Yang Zhenxin smiled and explained to everyone, "We are able to get rich entirely thanks to the party's policies and leadership. The farm is bigger than the family, and the country is bigger than the farm. We are party members, and we should consider the country first in everything we do."

With Yang Zhenxin's help, 9 poor households all became wealthy, building more than 50 rooms, purchasing more than 10 large livestock, and 21 bicycles. Four bachelors got married. Others changed, but the Yang family did not. In recent years, Yang Zhenxin's family did not add a single room, nor did they make a single piece of decent furniture. The old gate tower was about to collapse, and the courtyard wall had completely fallen, but he acted as if he did not see it. Not only did he not bring things into the house, but Old Yang also had to take things out. Small Horse Village is located in a dry and barren area, and Yang Zhenxin contributed 160,000 yuan to help the villagers build a water tower, allowing the villagers to have running water. They happily said, "Turning the water tap, thinking of Teacher Yang."

The villagers asked, "Old Yang, others with money build high-rise buildings, set up businesses, and dress well, what are you after?" Yang Zhenxin smiled and said:

	"Everyone has their own philosophy of life. I am a Communist Party member, and I seek to serve the people."

    欠债户翻身的领头人
    ——记山西省劳动模范杨振新
    张岸涛
    山西省闻喜县有个远近闻名的养猪联合体。之所以出名，因为它的成员过去都是欠了一屁股债的贫困户，而今又都是年收入上万元的富裕户。他们的领头人就是山西省人大代表、省劳动模范杨振新。
              勇揽“瓷器活”
    8年前的一天夜晚，闻喜县凹底镇小马村民委员会的大院里灯光明亮，村民正在对集体的副业摊进行承包投标。6个砖瓦窑，1个面粉加工厂成了“争抢”的热门货，唯有养猪场，是没人敢揽的“瓷器活”。因为那场已经几上几下，总是赔钱。
    最后，养猪能手杨振新接下了这“瓷器活”。干部再三叮嘱：“包了可不许反悔。”杨振新说：“敢包就决不反悔。”当晚他与村上签了10年承包合同，交了当年的1400元承包费。
    包是包了，可挺大的一摊子，一户拢不过来，杨振新找到一个磨粉的行家，可人家不愿干。他又找到一个富裕户，也碰了钉子。平日不爱动怒的杨振新，憋了一肚子火。他发誓：有技术、有钱的不干，找贫困户。他很快找到4户穷伙伴。这四户全是亏空户，欠债最多的1800元，最少的也有750元。杨振新带穷户办猪场，立时成了“新闻”，还有人说什么：
  “看他把猪场的老本赔光吧。”杨振新却说：
  “别人笑话我们穷，办不成事业，我看大伙只要有志气，有决心，拚命干，猪场一定能搞好。”几句话，说得穷伙伴们心里热乎乎的。
    摆在他们面前的是：3间破瓦房，5孔土窑洞，10个烂猪圈，16头骨瘦如柴的猪。面对这个摊子，他们迎难而上，筹集3000元，新打了围墙，增添了50头仔猪，还购置了两台新型磨粉机等生产工具。他们坚持走种、养、加工一条龙的新路。加工淀粉，粉渣喂猪，猪粪肥田，一年下来，他们向国家交售商品猪75头，全年盈利6960元，平均每户分得750元，剩余的留作周转资金。成捆的“大团结”，这几户还是第一次拿到。大家喜笑颜开，高兴得睡觉做梦都笑出了声。
              苦干加科学
    第二年初春，大地解冻，万物复苏。当猪场大幅度发展的时候，一场猪瘟一夜之间夺去了30多头猪的生命，其余的猪也危在旦夕。沉重的打击，使大家慌了手脚，杨振新更是心如刀绞，昼夜守在猪舍抢救病猪。一天晚上，已是9点多钟，他还没回家吃饭。妻子跑到猪场发现他正忙着给猪灌药，打针。她掉着眼泪说：“振新，你真憨了，这样晚还不回家吃饭。”“哪顾得上，你看，这几头猪病得正厉害。”直到凌晨两点，杨振新才拖着疲倦的身子回家，进门就一头倒在床上。
    吃一堑，长一智。此后，杨振新不仅苦干，而且努力钻研有关养猪的科学知识。他购买了《养猪学》、《猪病防治》等书籍，还到西安、兰州等地参观取经，学会了科学配料和防病治病。这年猪场不仅没垮，而且向国家交售商品猪100余头，存栏100头，纯收入达到1.2万元。年终，杨振新和四户共同商量，一次把十年的承包费15500元全部提前交给了村里。
    站稳了脚跟，猪场又吸收了5个贫穷户。摊子大了，人员多了，杨振新引入竞争机制和风险机制实行包干。人人有任务，个个挑重担。经过8年艰苦奋斗，养殖规模不断扩大，年产值由6300元增加到21万元，提高了30多倍。昔日破烂不堪的猪圈改建成64个三隔离新式猪圈，去年又安装了暖气、排风设备。这些现代化设施，使猪的饲养周期由10个月缩短为6个月。养猪场的固定资产由过去的2000元发展到60万元。
            共产党员的追求
    8年来，杨振新养猪场共向国家提供商品猪3000头，他们卖猪有个原则，只卖国家，不卖私人；只卖平价，不卖高价。1986年生猪生产下降，国家收购困难，市场肉价提高。在这种情况下，他们一连向国家交售了360头生猪，仅此一项，细算起来，就要比直接到市场销售少收入近2万元。社会有人笑话老杨是
  “憨憨”，场里也有人说他心眼太死，但杨振新笑着给大伙解释说：“咱们所以能致富，全靠党的政策和党的领导。场比家大，国比场大，咱是党员，凡事都要先考虑国家。”
    在杨振新的帮助下，9个贫困户都富裕起来了，先后共盖房50余间，购买大牲畜10余头，自行车21辆，有四个光棍娶了媳妇。别人都变了，杨家却没变。近几年，杨振新家房没添一间，像样的家具没做一件。旧门楼要垮了，院围墙全倒了，可他像没看见一样。不光不往家里搂，老杨还要常往外拿哩。小马村地处旱垣疙瘩，杨振新拿出1.6万元，帮助村民建起一座水塔，使村民们吃上自来水。他们高兴地说：“手拧水龙头，想起杨师傅。”
    村里人问：“老杨，人家有钱盖高楼，置家业，讲穿戴，你图个啥？”杨振新笑着说：
  “每个人都有自己的人生哲学，我是共产党员，图的是为人民服务。”
