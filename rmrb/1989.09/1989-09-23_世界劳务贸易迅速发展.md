The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) released a report titled "International Trade in 1988-1989" on September 15, indicating that service trade has become a significant component of global trade.

According to the report, the total value of commercial service exports worldwide in 1988 was approximately $560 billion, an 11% increase from the previous year, equivalent to the combined export value of food and fuel for the same year.

The report states that since the 1980s, the most rapidly developing sectors in service trade have been telecommunications, banking services, management, professional and technical services, and tourism. Statistics show that the United States is the world's largest service exporter, with exports accounting for 11.2% of the global total in 1988. Following the United States are France, the United Kingdom, and West Germany, with 10.6%, 8.6%, and 8.2% respectively. The world's largest service importer is West Germany, followed by the United States, Japan, and West Germany.
