		Several surgeons in London, England, with the help of psychologists, have designed a unique "music operating room." This operating room is specially designed to have excellent sound effects, allowing patients to enjoy beautiful music while undergoing surgery. Patients under general anesthesia are particularly sensitive to music. Slow-tempo music can help patients relax their nerves and muscles, making the surgery proceed more smoothly. Additionally, the incidence of surgical errors by surgeons has significantly decreased.

    音乐助手术
    英国伦敦的几位外科医生在心理学家的帮助下设计了一种奇特的“音乐手术室”。这种手术室特意设计得具有特佳音响效果，以便病人一边接受手术，一边欣赏优美音乐。处于全麻状态的病人对音乐十分敏感，那些节奏缓慢的乐曲能帮助病人松弛神经和肌肉紧张，从而使手术进行得更为顺利。此外，外科医生手术失误也大为减少。	（梦　之）
