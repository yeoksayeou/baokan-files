Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived in Damascus this evening, beginning a three-day friendly visit to Syria.

At the Damascus airport, Qian Qichen told the Syrian media, "At the invitation of Foreign Minister Shara, I have the opportunity to visit Syria, and I am genuinely pleased. China and Syria have a deep friendship. Our peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other in opposing hegemony, maintaining world and regional peace, and in the noble cause of building our respective countries. In recent years, our friendly cooperative relations, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been continuously strengthened and developed. This not only serves the common interests and wishes of the peoples of both countries but also helps to promote the unity and cooperation of Third World countries, contributing to the common cause of the world."

Qian Qichen said, "China has always attached great importance to Syria's important role and influence in Middle East affairs and highly appreciates the Syrian government and people's just struggle under the leadership of President Assad to resist Israeli aggression and expansion and to recover lost territories."

He said, "At present, the situation in the Middle East is undergoing important changes. My visit to Syria at this time is to exchange views with Foreign Minister Shara and other Syrian leaders on international issues of mutual concern, especially the Middle East situation and bilateral relations. I hope this visit will help to promote the sustained development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries."

Qian Qichen arrived in Damascus after concluding his visit to Egypt.
