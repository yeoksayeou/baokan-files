The "Eight Hundred Li of Dongting" is a crucial commercial grain base for the nation and a treasure land of Hunan. It not only attracts domestic and foreign tourists with its vast and beautiful scenery and its long and mysterious natural and human history, but also is renowned far and wide for its convenient transportation, fertile soil, and abundant production of rice and fresh fish since ancient times, earning the title of the "Land of Fish and Rice." On this fertile land, which accounts for 16% of the province's cultivated area, 30% of the grain, 76% of the cotton, 46% of the oil crops, and 94% of the hemp are produced. The average output per unit of land is 3.54 times higher than the national average and 0.78 times higher than the provincial average. This area also produces 25% of the province's pigs, 43% of aquatic products, and 25% of the total industrial output. The total industrial and agricultural output per square kilometer is 1.68 times and 2.92 times higher than the provincial and national averages, respectively. Since 1965, it has delivered 500 million kilograms of commercial rice to the state each year, accounting for approximately 80% of the province's upward adjustment of rice. In particular, in recent years, it has provided 2.15 million tons of commercial grain to society each year, with each agricultural population contributing an average of 170 kilograms per year. At the same time, it provides more than 500,000 tons of commercial oil, 3.9 million commercial pigs, and 1.1 million tons of commercial fish annually, making significant contributions to the state.

Before liberation, the Dongting Lake area was plagued by frequent floods, epidemics, and desolation, making life unbearable for the people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the lake area have relied on their own efforts and worked hard to carry out large-scale comprehensive treatment and garden-style construction of Dongting Lake. Over the past 40 years, a total of 2.3 billion man-days of labor have been invested, completing 3.3 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, with the amount of embankment and water control engineering approximately three times that of the Great Wall. More than 8,600 kilometers of embankments have been reinforced, 20,000 kilometers of canals have been dug, and the cultivated land area has increased from 5.9 million mu before liberation to 14.1 million mu. More than 1.3 billion trees have been planted along the fields, embankments, canals, and roads, and 17,300 kilometers of roads and canals have been greened. A total of 15 state-owned farms, more than 130 state-owned agricultural, forestry, and aquaculture farms and stations, 11 national-level commercial grain base counties, 1 high-quality cotton base county, 10 lean meat pig base counties, and 11 commercial fish base counties have been established. Food processing, textile, papermaking, and other industries rooted in agriculture, as well as supporting agriculture industries and courtyard economies, have rapidly emerged. Today's "Eight Hundred Li of Dongting" has a network of canals, square fields, abundant harvests, and prosperous livestock, presenting a thriving scene. Compared to the early days of liberation, grain production has increased by 2.3 times, cotton by 4.5 times, oil crops by 7.6 times, pigs by 10.1 times, aquatic products by 8.3 times, and the self-sufficiency rate of timber has reached 50%. Farmers' income has significantly increased, and people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, cultural life, and spiritual outlook have undergone profound changes.

The vast Dongting Lake holds immense development potential. The 6 million people of the lake area are riding the spring breeze of reform and opening up, carrying forward the spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship, thoroughly eliminating water disasters, leveraging their advantages, and striving towards a safe, prosperous, civilized, and modern comprehensive agricultural commodity base for the nation. The "Land of Fish and Rice in Dongting" will make even greater contributions to the Four Modernizations.

    洞庭鱼米乡
    “八百里洞庭”是国家重要的商品粮基地，是湖南的一块宝地。她不仅以其烟波浩渺的绮丽风光和悠久神奇的自然人文历史吸引着中外游客，而且以其交通便利、地肥田沃、自古盛产大米鲜鱼而远近闻名，素称鱼米之乡。在这片耕地面积为全省16％的沃土上，生产了30％的粮食、76％的棉花、46％的油料、94％的麻类，土地平均产出率高出全国3.54倍和全省0.78倍。这里还生产了占全省25％的生猪、43％的水产品，25％的工业总产值，每平方公里产生的工农业总产值分别为全省及全国的1.68倍和2.92倍。1965年以来，每年上交国家商品大米5亿公斤，约占全省上调大米的80％。尤其是近几年，每年向社会提供商品粮215万吨，每个农业人口年均贡献170公斤。同时每年还提供商品油5万多吨，商品猪390多万头，商品鱼11万多吨，对国家作出了重大贡献。
    解放前的洞庭湖区，水患不断，瘟疫流行，满目疮痍，民不聊生。解放后，湖区人民在党和政府领导下，自力更生、艰苦奋斗，对洞庭湖进行了大规模的综合治理和田园化建设。40年来，累计投工23亿个，完成土石方33亿立方米，筑堤治水工程量约为万里长城的3倍，加固堤防8600多公里，开渠2万多公里，耕地面积由解放前的590万亩增加到1410万亩，田、堤、渠、路旁植树13亿多株，绿化公路水渠17300多公里。先后建成了15个国营农场，130多个国营农林水产场、所，11个国家级商品粮基地县，1个优质棉基地县，10个瘦肉型猪基地县和11个商品鱼基地县。植根于农业的食品、纺织、造纸等加工工业和支农工业、庭院经济也迅速崛起。如今的“八百里洞庭”，渠成网，田成方，五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，一派欣欣向荣的景象。与解放初相比，粮食增长2.3倍，棉花增长4.5倍，油料增长7.6倍，生猪增长10.1倍，水产品增长8.3倍，木材自给率达50％，农民收入大幅度增长，人们的衣食住行、文化生活和精神面貌都发生了深刻的变化。
    浩瀚洞庭，蕴藏着巨大开发潜力。600万湖区人民正乘着改革开放的春风，发扬艰苦创业的精神，彻底根治水害，发挥优势，向着安全、富庶、文明、发达的全国综合性现代化农业商品基地迈进。“洞庭鱼米乡”将进一步为四化建设作出更大贡献。
