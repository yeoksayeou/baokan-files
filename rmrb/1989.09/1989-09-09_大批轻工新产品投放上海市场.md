A large number of new light industrial products have been introduced to the Shanghai market ahead of National Day, receiving enthusiastic welcome from consumers. This is the first batch of valuable results from the city's product structure adjustment in the first half of this year.

In recent years, as consumers' demands for consumer goods have continuously increased, the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau has taken the lead in prioritizing new product development. This work has received strong support from the municipal government, science and technology departments, and various industries. The new products entering the market for the first time in China include electric heating thermos bottles, high-end quartz electronic watches, watches for the blind, 5-speed 10-speed men's and women's bicycles, children's series skincare products, and sandblasted glass cup series, among others. New export-oriented products include various new types of bicycles, Hero-brand all-plastic mouth organs, and perforated watches.

    大批轻工新产品投放上海市场
    本报上海电　记者章世鸿报道：国庆前夕，上海585种轻工新产品投放市场，受到消费者热烈欢迎。这是该市今年上半年产品结构调整的第一批可贵成果。
    近年来，由于消费者对消费品的要求不断提高，上海轻工局一马当先，把新产品开发放在首要地位。这项工作得到市府领导、科技部门和各行各业大力支持。新投入市场的新产品在我国都是第一次出现。如电加热保温瓶、高级石英电子表、盲人手表、5飞10速男女自行车、儿童系列护肤用品、蒙砂玻璃杯系列等。出口创汇新产品有：各种新型自行车、英雄牌全塑口琴、镂空手表等。
