The socialist cause is advancing.

Since the State Council approved the establishment of the Hunan Southern Reform and Opening-Up Transition Experimental Zone last year, listing Hunan Southern as a national agricultural development priority area, the long-planned comprehensive development of Hunan Southern has officially begun. This winter and spring, 400,000 mu of wasteland suitable for farming has been reclaimed, 550,000 mu of dry land has been converted to paddy fields, 880,000 mu of low-yield fields have been improved, 680,000 mu of high-yield fields have been constructed, and 1.12 million mu of barren hills have been afforested.

The Hunan Southern Reform and Opening-Up Transition Experimental Zone includes the cities of Hengyang, Chenzhou, and Lingling, comprising 31 counties and cities. It is adjacent to Guangdong and Guangxi, near the special economic zones of Hainan, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, serving as a "transition zone" and "junction" connecting the coastal areas with the inland regions. It has 9 million mu of cultivable wasteland, 17.31 million mu of land suitable for forestry and animal husbandry; it holds significant reserves of lead, zinc, tungsten, copper, and molybdenum. The Jishuzhuang multi-metal mine is renowned as the "Museum of Non-Ferrous Metals"; the proven reserves of brine are over 10 billion tons, coal reserves are 1.2 billion tons, and hydropower potential reaches 3.674 million kilowatts. These abundant resources provide favorable conditions for the development of Hunan Southern.

According to the development plan, Hunan Southern will promote reform and opening-up, gradually building an outward-looking comprehensive agricultural commodity base and industrial base. Agricultural comprehensive development will focus on grain production, aiming to establish Hunan Southern as the second major grain commodity base after Dongting Lake. From 1989 to 1991, a total investment of 540 million yuan is planned to construct and complement 64 large and medium-sized irrigation districts, reclaim 500,000 mu of land for grain cultivation, improve 1.8 million mu of low-yield fields, convert 180,000 mu of dry land to paddy fields, develop 160,000 mu of large water surfaces, afforest 400,000 mu of land, and reclaim 75,000 mu of land for fruit cultivation. By 1992, the total grain production is expected to reach 7.67 billion kilograms, with a net grain output of 750 million kilograms and a meat output of 145,000 tons. By the year 2000, 18 grain commodity bases, 24 lean meat pig bases, and several high-quality tobacco, fruit, tea, sugarcane, waterfowl, and grass-fed livestock production bases will be established. Simultaneously, non-ferrous, coal, and chemical industries will gradually form basic industrial bases. Once these bases are established, they will be able to supply significant amounts of grain, meat, poultry, and scarce raw materials to coastal regions like Guangdong annually.

Currently, the people of Hunan Southern are diligently implementing various measures to strive for the full completion of the planned goals. The development of Hunan Southern holds a broad prospect.

    建设综合农业商品基地
    湘南拉开大规模开发序幕
    本报讯　自去年国务院批复湖南建立湘南改革开放过渡试验区，把湘南列为全国农业重点开发区之后，酝酿了多年的湘南综合开发的序幕，已全面拉开。去冬今春，已开垦宜农荒地40万亩，旱土改水田5.5万亩，改造低产田88万亩，建设吨粮田68万亩，荒山造林112万亩。
    湘南改革开放过渡试验区包括衡阳、郴州、零陵三个地市共31个县市。它紧靠两广，邻近海南、深圳、珠海等特区和港澳，是联结沿海与内地的“过渡区”和“结合部”。它尚有可垦荒地900万亩，宜林宜牧荒地1731万亩；铅、锌、钨、铜、钼的储量在全国占有重要位置。柿竹园多金属矿，被誉为“有色金属博物馆”；探明的盐卤远景储量为100多亿吨，煤炭储量为12亿吨，水能蕴藏量达367.4万千瓦。丰富的资源为开发湘南提供了有利条件。
    根据发展规划，湘南将以改革促开放，以开放促开发，逐步建成“面向沿海、打入港澳”的外向型综合农业商品基地和基础工业基地。农业综合开发以粮食为重点，把湘南建设成继洞庭湖之后的第二个商品粮基地。1989年—1991年计划总投资5.4亿元，兴修和配套大中型水利工程灌区64处，开荒种粮50万亩，改造低产田180万亩，旱土改水田18万亩，大水面开发16万亩，造林40万亩，开荒种果7.5万亩。到1992年粮食总产量达76.7亿公斤，粮食净调出量为7.5亿公斤，肉类调出量为14.5万吨。到2000年，将建成18个商品粮基地、24个瘦肉型猪基地以及若干个优质烤烟、水果、茶叶、甘蔗、水禽、草食牲畜生产基地。同时，将逐步形成有色、煤炭、盐化工等基础工业基地。这些基地建成后，每年可向广东等沿海地区提供可观的商品粮、肉禽和短缺原材料。
    目前，湘南人民正在认真落实各项措施，为全面完成规划目标而努力奋斗。湘南开发，前景广阔。
