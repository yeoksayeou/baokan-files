Before liberation, the old China had very little international scientific and technological exchange, with only sporadic activities.

Since the founding of New China, the government has attached great importance to international scientific and technological cooperation and exchange. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, Chinese scientific and technological personnel have carried out extensive cooperation and exchanges with the world through various channels such as official, non-governmental, bilateral, and multilateral, thus forming a new situation of multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form international scientific and technological cooperation.

Currently, the number of countries and regions that have scientific and technological exchanges with China has reached 108, and the number of countries or regions that have signed government-level scientific and technological cooperation agreements or economic, trade, and scientific and technological cooperation agreements with China is 57. The cooperation and exchanges between various departments, local scientific research institutions, universities, and industrial and mining enterprises with their foreign counterparts are even more extensive.

In 1988 alone, China's scientific and technological exchanges with various countries amounted to 13,300 items, an increase of 11.6 times compared to 1978. The number of people involved in these exchanges was 38,300, an increase of 5.8 times compared to 1978. The number of people participating in international academic conferences abroad was 4,500, an increase of 8 times compared to 1978.

    多层次多渠道多形式国际科技交流
    解放前，旧中国的科技国际交流很少，只有一些零星活动。
    新中国成立后，政府十分重视国际科技合作与交流。特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，我国科技人员在世界范围内通过官方、民间、双边、多边各种渠道开展广泛的合作交流，从而形成多层次、多渠道、多形式的国际科技合作新局面。
    目前，与我国进行科技交流的国家和地区已达一百零八个，与我国签订政府间科技合作协定或经济、贸易和科技合作协定的国家或地区有五十七个。各部门、各地方属科研机构，各高校和工矿企业等与国外对口单位的合作与交流更为广泛。
    仅一九八八年，我国与各国的科技交流项目达一万三千三百余项，比一九七八年增长十一点六倍，交往人数三万八千三百余人，比一九七八年增加五点八倍，出国参加国际学术会议的人员四千五百余人次，比一九七八年增八倍。　（龚高）
