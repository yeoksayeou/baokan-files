    Song Jian, along with relevant officials, conducted on-site office work to determine a comprehensive treatment plan for Benxi pollution. Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, September 24th - Reporter Xie Lianhui reports: To further implement the instructions from Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, and the elder revolutionary comrade Chen Yun regarding the treatment of Benxi's environmental pollution, State Councilor and Chairman of the State Council Environmental Protection Commission Song Jian, from September 21st to 23rd, led relevant officials from the State Council departments and the main officials from the Liaoning Provincial Government to Benxi for on-site office work. They officially approved the 7-year plan to treat pollution in Benxi, a city that is "invisible from satellites," in three phases.

    To effectively treat the most severe air pollution in Benxi, the State Council Environmental Protection Commission decided to adopt special policies to raise funds for Benxi's pollution treatment, even in the context of national financial austerity. The provincial government also decided to provide part of the funds for treating Benxi's pollution.

    Song Jian pointed out at the on-site meeting that Benxi is an important production base for industrial raw materials in China, making significant contributions to the cause of socialist modernization. They send first-class industrial products and main raw materials to where they are needed nationwide, while leaving the waste and pollutants for themselves, causing a city with "beautiful mountains and rivers" to often be shrouded in smog. This situation has drawn the attention of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the people of the whole country. He said, the various factories and mines in Benxi must be determined to rely on self-reliance, not wait for others, raise funds independently, and use advanced scientific and technological means to treat pollution. When necessary, they should not hesitate to slow down the pace of development a bit, but must continuously improve the working and living environment for all the people in the city.

    宋健会同有关方面负责人现场办公
    综合治理本溪污染规划确定
    本报本溪9月24日电　记者谢联辉报道：为了进一步落实李鹏总理、姚依林副总理以及老一辈无产阶级革命家陈云有关本溪市环境污染治理批示，国务委员、国务院环境保护委员会主任宋健于9月21日至23日，率国务院有关部委同志会同辽宁省政府主要负责同志，到本溪市现场办公，正式拍板批准这座“卫星上看不见的城市”分3个阶段治理污染的7年规划。
    为了治理好我国大气污染最严重的本溪，国务院环委会在国家紧缩银根的情况下，决定采取特殊政策，为本溪市治理污染筹集资金，省政府也决定为治理本溪污染提供部分资金。
    宋健在现场会上指出，本溪市是我国工业原材料的重要生产基地，为社会主义现代化建设事业做出了重大贡献。他们把第一流的工业产品和主要原料运到全国需要的地方，而把废弃物和污染物留给自己，使一个“山川秀丽”的城市经常处于烟雾弥漫之中。这种情况引起了党中央、国务院和全国人民的关注。他说，本溪各厂矿企业要下决心立足于自力更生、不等不靠、自筹资金、依靠先进的科学技术去治理污染，必要时不惜放慢一点发展速度，也要不断改善全市人民的工作和生活环境。
