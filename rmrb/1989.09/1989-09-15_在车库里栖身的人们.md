Elizabeth Rodriguez, 27, is a worker at a clothing factory in Los Angeles. She has six children, along with her mother and two brothers, making a total of ten people living in a single garage. Three thin mattresses laid on the floor serve as beds for the entire family. Apart from these, a few pieces of clothing hanging on the walls are all they possess.

Rodriguez pays $400 a month for the garage. Her weekly salary is only $160, which means her monthly income is barely enough to cover the rent, leaving very little for other expenses. Her financial struggles are evident.

Statistics show that in Los Angeles, approximately 40,000 households live in garages, similar to Rodriguez's situation. A survey indicates that in 1980, the average rent for a room in the city was $250 per month. In just nine years, the rent has more than doubled. Now, to rent the same room, one would need at least $525.

Squire, the housing coordinator of the city mayor's office, pointed out the reasons for the rent increase: Los Angeles sees about 25,000 new households entering the rental market each year, but the construction of new housing units lags behind, with only about 14,000 units built annually. The gap between supply and demand drives up housing prices.

To mitigate this conflict, relevant authorities are implementing two solutions. The first is a renovation plan, where the city government supports a $100 million project to renovate 45,000 housing units. The second measure requires housing developers to contribute some funds for low-income housing. While these two initiatives will help alleviate the housing shortage in Los Angeles in the future, they are not immediate solutions, and more people will continue to live like Rodriguez in the near term.

Bernardi, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, expressed his concern: "In the San Fernando Valley, about 10% of two-person households rent garages to live in, and they are usually the families with the least financial burden. In some older areas, 'garage homes' are even more common. We cannot ask them to move out of these disgusting 'nests.' If we do, they will have to live on the streets."

　　在车库里栖身的人们
    今年二十七岁的伊丽莎白·罗德里格斯是美国洛杉矶市一家服装厂的女工，已有六个孩子，她还有母亲和两个兄弟，全家共十口人挤在一间车库里。空荡荡的铺在地上的三张垫褥就是他们一家十口的床。除此之外，四处挂在墙上的几件换用衣服便是全部家当。
    罗德里格斯每个月要为这间栖身的车库付四百美元租金。她的周薪仅有一百六十美元，一月的薪水除了支付房租，所剩寥寥无几。生活之拮据，可想而知。
    据统计，在洛杉矶，像罗德里格斯一样栖居车库的约有四万户。一项调查显示，一九八○年该市每间房屋平均租价是每月二百五十美元，短短九年时间，租金已翻了一倍还多。现在，如想再租同样的一间房，至少要五百二十五美元以上才可成交。
    该市市长公署的房屋协调员斯奎尔指出了房租上涨的原因：洛杉矶每年加入租屋行列的新家庭大约有二点五万户，可是，洛杉矶房屋建设却越来越滞后，每年兴建的住屋单位大约只有一点四万个。供需差距大，房价就上涨。
    为避免这种矛盾进一步激化，有关方面正着手实施两项解决办法。其一是修复计划，由市政府支持一项耗资一亿美元的工程，以修复四点五万个住屋单位；另一项办法规定由房屋发展商为低收入者住屋支付一些费用。尽管这两项措施会对未来洛杉矶的住房紧张状况起一定缓解作用，但远水解不了近渴，更多的人在近期内会像罗德里格斯那样生活。
    洛杉矶市议会议员伯纳迪不无焦虑地说：“在圣费尔南多谷地区，仅一对夫妻组成的双人家庭中，就有大约百分之十是租车库来住，而他们通常是负担最少的家庭。如果在一些比较‘古老’的地方，‘车库住家’更是比比皆是。我们无法要求他们搬出这些令人一见就作呕的‘窝’，如果真要那样做的话，他们就得到公路上去住了。”
