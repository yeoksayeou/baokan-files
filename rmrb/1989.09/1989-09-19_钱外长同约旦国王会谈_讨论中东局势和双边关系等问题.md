Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held a secret one-hour meeting with Jordanian King Hussein today in Amman to discuss three hotspot issues in the Middle East— the Arab-Israeli conflict, the situation in Lebanon, and the Iran-Iraq peace talks—as well as bilateral relations.

According to sources who attended the meeting, both sides expressed the hope that the three hotspot issues in the Middle East could be resolved as soon as possible to achieve a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.

The Arab-Israeli conflict was the primary issue discussed. Foreign Minister Qian pointed out that history has provided a good opportunity. As long as Arab countries and the Palestinian people unite and make active efforts, he believes that with the support of the international community, the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially the Palestinian issue, will be resolved in a just, reasonable, and comprehensive manner. King Hussein, on the other hand, hoped that China, as a major country and a permanent member of the Security Council, would strive for this in international affairs, especially at the United Nations.

At the beginning of the meeting, Foreign Minister Qian handed over a personal letter from Chinese President Yang Shangkun to the King. In the letter, Yang Shangkun invited the King to visit China, and the King expressed his gratitude and hope to do so. The King said, "The relationship between the two countries is friendly. Chairman Yang's letter is full of deep friendship, reflecting that the relationship between the two countries is based on mutual trust and a solid foundation."

Foreign Minister Qian also briefly introduced the situation of the suppression of the riot in China to the King and thanked Jordan for its understanding of the actions taken by the Chinese government. The King emphasized that he has always taken a completely understanding attitude towards the events in China. He said, "For a period of time, I was concerned about the events in China. I saw foreign forces interfering in Chinese affairs. Now that the situation in China has stabilized, I am happy about it."

　　讨论中东局势和双边关系等问题
    新华社安曼9月17日电　（记者陈如为）中国外长钱其琛今天在这里同约旦国王侯赛因就中东地区的3个热点问题——阿以冲突、黎巴嫩局势和两伊和谈以及双边关系举行了1小时秘密会谈。
    据参加会谈的人士说，双方都表示希望中东地区的3个热点问题尽快得到解决，使该地区实现公正、全面、持久的和平。
    会谈中，阿以冲突被列为首要的问题讨论。钱外长指出，历史提供了极好机会，只要阿拉伯国家和巴勒斯坦人民团结一致，积极努力，他相信在国际社会的支持下，阿以冲突，特别是巴勒斯坦问题，会得到公正、合理、全面的解决。侯赛因国王则希望中国作为一个大国和安理会常任理事国，在国际事务中，特别是在联合国，为此而努力。
    钱外长在会谈开始时，向国王提交了中国国家主席杨尚昆的一封亲笔信。杨尚昆在信中邀请国王访华，国王对此表示感谢并希望成行。国王说：“两国关系是亲切的，杨主席的信充满着深厚友情，反映两国关系是建立在相互信赖和牢固的基础上的。”
    钱外长还简要地向这位国王介绍了中国国内平暴情况，并感谢约旦对中国政府所采取的这一行动表示理解的态度。国王强调他对中国发生的事情一直采取完全理解的态度。他说：“有一段时间，我对中国发生的事情感到忧虑，我看到了外国势力对中国事务的干涉。现在，中国局势稳定了，我对此感到高兴。”
