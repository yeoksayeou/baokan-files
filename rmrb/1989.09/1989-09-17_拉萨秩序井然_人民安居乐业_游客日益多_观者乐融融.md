Lhasa has been under martial law for half a year now. What is the current situation?

In late August, the author wandered around Lhasa city and observed the following: the streets were bustling with vehicles and pedestrians, each going their own way; along the streets, vendors were loudly hawking their wares; at the counters, people were carefree, selecting items they liked; in the parks, visitors came and went, some taking photos, others chatting, all enjoying themselves.

The author learned that since 1979, the Tibet Autonomous Region has established various levels of tourism management departments, built more than 20 hotels and restaurants for foreign visitors, and opened over 40 tourist attractions. There are more than 2,500 people employed in the tourism industry. Over the past decade, the region has hosted more than 120,000 tourists from over 20 countries and regions.

The author visited Lhasa Hotel, the largest hotel in Lhasa primarily serving foreign tourists. The general manager, Lin Na (an Austrian), explained: "Due to the unrest in Lhasa and the turmoil in Beijing, the number of tourists visiting Lhasa has significantly decreased, making the hotel's business very sluggish in the first half of the year. Since martial law was imposed in Lhasa, the situation has gradually improved, and the situation has stabilized. Since late June, the number of foreign tourists has been increasing, and the hotel's operations have started to recover."

In front of the Potala Palace in the city center, a group of tourists from Britain, France, Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong, and Macau mingled with the crowds. They all had smiles on their faces, and many pointed their cameras at the long-awaited Potala Palace, "click, click," capturing memorable photos.

When the author asked about their impressions of Lhasa, a French-speaking tourist said: "We originally planned to come to Lhasa in early June. But we heard about the unrest in Lhasa and the turmoil in Beijing, which made us fearful and hesitant to come. We postponed our trip until mid-August to finally arrive in Lhasa."

The gentleman continued: "In the past few days, we have visited many places in Lhasa. The situation here is much better than we imagined. There is no sign of tension or fear, and everywhere we see a joyful and peaceful atmosphere. Just as the Tibetans often say, '雅古都'!"

### 拉萨秩序井然　人民安居乐业　游客日益多　观者乐融融

　　拉萨秩序井然　人民安居乐业
　　游客日益多　观者乐融融
    拉萨市区实行戒严半年了，现在的情况怎样呢？
    8月下旬，笔者在拉萨市区周游漫步，看到的是这样的景象：大街上车来人往，各行其道；街道两旁，商贩们在使劲地叫卖；柜台边，人们无忧无虑地选购自己满意的商品；公园中，游人穿梭来往，或拍照，或聊天，其乐融融。
    笔者了解到，1979年以来，西藏自治区相继建立了各级旅游管理部门，兴建涉外旅馆、饭店20余家，开设旅游参观点40多处，旅游从业人员达2500多人。近10年来，共接待来自20多个国家和地区的游客12万多人。
    笔者来到拉萨最大的以接待外国游客为主的拉萨饭店，总经理林纳（奥地利人）介绍说：由于拉萨的骚乱和北京的动乱，前来拉萨旅游观光者大幅度减少，致使该饭店上半年生意很不景气。拉萨实行戒严以后，秩序逐步好转，局势稳定。6月底以来，外国游客日渐增多，饭店经营开始好转。
    在市中心布达拉宫前面的劳动人民文化宫，一批来自英国、法国、瑞士、日本、香港、澳门等国家和地区的游客，随游于众多游人之间，他们个个面带笑容，不少人还将镜头对准他们向往已久的布达拉宫，“咔嚓、咔嚓”，拍下了一张张难得的纪念照。
    当笔者问起他们在拉萨游历的观感时，一位操法语的游客说：“我们原计划是6月初来拉萨的。但听说拉萨发生了骚乱，北京又发生了动乱，我们产生了恐惧感，不敢来。一直推迟到8月中旬才到拉萨。”
    这位先生接着说：“这些天来，我们在拉萨参观游览了许多地方。拉萨的情况，远比我们原来想象的要好得多，看不见一点紧张恐惧的气氛，到处呈现一派喜气洋洋、安居乐业的景象。就像藏民们常说的‘雅古都’！”
