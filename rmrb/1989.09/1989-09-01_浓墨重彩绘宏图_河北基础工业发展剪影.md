Opening the scroll of Hebei Province's industrial development, what first catches the eye is the heavier tones and longer arrows of progress in the basic industries.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, Hebei Province has consistently prioritized investment in basic industries. Especially in the 10 years since the reform and opening up, they have shifted from general investment in basic industries to focused investment, dedicating significant efforts to the construction of major projects.

It is during these 10 years that the land of Yan and Zhao has seen the rise of one of the country's three 600,000-ton construction projects, the Tangshan Soda Plant; the emergence of the nation's first modern large-scale dry-process cement production enterprise, the Jidong Cement Plant; the commencement of the construction of the Middle-East Fertilizer Company, the second-largest producer of new-type phosphate ammonium fertilizer in Asia; the establishment of modern glass production lines using the float process; and the implementation of grand plans for water diversion projects from Luan River to Tianjin and Tangshan, as well as port and power plant construction.

People often refer to the coal industry as the staple of industrial production, and the coal produced in Hebei Province is known as the fine flour of this staple. Among the province's 15 billion tons of coal reserves, 9 billion tons are coking coal, ranking first in the nation. In addition to the steel plants within the province, the six major steel bases across the country all rely on the coking coal shipped from here… Calculating by trains of 50 carriages, Hebei Province exports an average of 14 trains of coal every day! However, it is hard to imagine that while large quantities of high-quality coal are being shipped out, the provincial leaders and entrepreneurs are carefully studying how to import low-quality coal from other provinces and how to utilize coal gangue to solve the problems of power plant coal supply and coal for people's daily use.

Over the past 40 years, Hebei Province has simultaneously focused on the expansion and renovation of old mines and supported the production of local small coal mines, increasing coal mining by 42.57 million tons. The coal production from small coal mines has reached 10 million tons, accounting for 1/6 of the total production. Currently, a large-scale coal industrial base with a capacity of over 1,000 million tons—the Yuxian Coalfield—is being actively planned for development.

The power industry is a bottleneck constraining the development of agriculture and industry. Thanks to the united efforts of all, Hebei Province's annual power generation now ranks third in the nation. Every year, it exports 2.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to other provinces. The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period saw the fastest development in power, with the installed capacity formed during this period equivalent to the sum of the installed capacity since the founding of the nation up to the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

Not only does Hebei Province lead the nation in iron ore production, but the 10 years of reform and opening-up policies have also ignited the enthusiasm of the Hebei people to develop the steel industry, making the two main lines of mining points in the province so deep and rich. One line extends along the southern side of the Yanshan Mountains through Qinglong, Kuancity, Chengde, Xinglong, Qian'an, Qianxi, and Zhuhua; the other line extends along the southern part of the Taihang Mountains through Shahe, Wuan, Xiexian, and Xingtai, making the province's annual iron concentrate production (excluding Shougang) reach 8.8267 million tons.

Tangshan Steel Plant, Xuanhua Steel Plant, and Handan Steel Plant have fully utilized the existing conditions of old enterprises to respectively build 1260 cubic meter blast furnaces, pushing steel production to a new level.

Hebei Province has also leveraged its resource advantages and attracted national key projects through multi-channel investments, making the chemical and building materials industries rise rapidly.

Nearly a million workers in the province are carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard work and selfless dedication, contributing all their wisdom and strength to the cause of socialist modernization in our country.

    浓墨重彩绘宏图
    ——河北基础工业发展剪影
    打开河北省工业发展的画卷，首先吸引人们目光的是：基础工业这块色调更重、发展的箭头更长了。
    建国40年来，河北省一直把基础工业作为投资的重点。特别是改革开放以来的10年，他们把对基础工业的普遍投资转变为重点投资，用大的精力着眼于大项目建设。
    正是在这10年间，燕赵大地崛起了国内仅有的三个60万吨建设规模之一的唐山纯碱厂；出现了全国第一座现代化的大型干法水泥生产企业——冀东水泥厂；开始了亚洲第二个生产磷铵新型化肥原料的中阿化肥有限公司的工程建设；有了现代化技术水平的浮法玻璃生产线；有了引滦入津、引滦入唐输水工程以及码头和电厂建设宏图的施展。
    人们把煤炭工业形容为工业生产的食粮，而河北省出产的煤炭又称之为食粮中的精粉。在省内的150亿吨煤炭储量中，竟有90亿吨为焦煤，居全国第一位。除河北省境内的钢铁厂外，全国六大钢铁基地都等待这里运出的焦煤填肚子……按50节车厢的列车算，河北省平均每天向外输出的煤炭为14列！然而，人们很难想象，当大量的优质煤炭源源外运时，河北省的省长和企业家们却悉心研究如何去外省拉劣质煤，研究如何利用煤矸石来解决电厂用煤及人民生活用煤的困难。
    40年间，河北省一手抓紧对老井的扩建改造，一手扶持地方小煤窑的生产，新增煤炭开采4257万吨。小煤窑的煤炭产量已达1000万吨，占整个产量的1／6。目前，一座上千万吨的大型煤炭工业基地——蔚县煤田正在积极筹划开发之中。
    电力工业是制约工农业发展的瓶颈产业，由于上下一心奋起直追，现在河北省的年发电量居全国第三位。每年，还向外省输电能27亿千瓦时。“七五”期间成为电力发展最快的时期，这个时期所形成的装机容量相当于建国以来到“七五”以前装机容量之和。
    不仅仅由于河北省铁矿石的产量在全国居首位，更由于10年改革开放政策激发了河北人民大上钢铁业的热情，使全省采矿点的两条主线这么深这么浓。一条沿燕山南侧青龙、宽城、承德、兴隆、迁安、迁西、遵化延伸；一条沿太行山南部沙河、武安、涉县、邢台延伸，使全省铁精粉年产量（不包括首钢）达到882.67万吨。
    唐山钢厂、宣化钢厂、邯钢充分利用老企业现有条件分别上了1260立方米高炉，使钢的产量向新的台阶跨步。
    河北省还以资源优势和多方投资吸引国家重点项目。为此，使化工、建材业又异军突起。
    全省近百万职工的产业大军，正在发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和无私奉献的精神，为祖国社会主义现代化建设事业贡献着全部的智慧和力量。
