To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, various communities in Hong Kong and Macau, along with patriotic compatriots, have been holding celebrations in diverse forms.

The Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch held a reception tonight at the World Trade Centre in Causeway Bay. Governor Sir David Wilson and his wife attended the event. Xu Jiatun, Director of the Hong Kong branch, made a toast, saying, “To observe the waves, one must look at the vast ocean.” China has been developing and progressing for 40 years, and despite the twists and turns along the way, it is like a vast and mighty river, surging forward. He expressed that we should jointly adhere to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the principle of "one country, two systems," strengthen cooperation, and make the "Pearl of the Orient" shine even brighter!

Preparations for National Day celebrations in Macau began in early September. Zhou Ding, Director of the Xinhua News Agency's Macau branch, delivered a speech titled "Boost Confidence, Forge Ahead" at the preparatory meeting. He praised the Macau compatriots for their glorious tradition of loving the motherland and loving Macau, and hoped that they would carry forward this spirit in the future.
