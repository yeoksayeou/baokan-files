In recent years, Teacher Yu has been a prominent figure at Nanchang No. 2 Middle School. His extraordinary life experiences have left people astonished and admiring; his relentless pursuit of his career has inspired and enlightened others.

**Facing the Threat of Disease Bravely**

In the spring of 1982, at the age of 30, Yu Huailai's life was as sweet and vibrant as a spring of water. Having graduated from Shanghai Foreign Language Institute and worked at Nanchang No. 2 Middle School for just two years, he had already made a name for himself in his career, being selected as a member of the city's central teaching research group, and had a loving wife. Unfortunately, misfortune struck—he was diagnosed with cancer! With only 3 to 5 years of life left...

Well-wishers offered various suggestions, anxious leaders provided nutritional supplements and two round-trip tickets to Shanghai, and even arranged for medical treatment outside the province. When Yu received the biopsy report, the tears he had held back earlier now flowed freely, and everyone present was deeply moved. Yu wiped away his tears and said softly, "I won't go anywhere." He wasn't just saying it; he had already sworn to dedicate his life to the Party's cause. Now, every additional class he taught would bring more comfort. He immediately checked into the Second Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi Medical College. Fortunately, the surgery was successful, followed by three months of cobalt-60 radiation therapy. Yu's white blood cell count dropped sharply, causing dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, making it difficult for him to rest. However, as soon as his spirits improved slightly, he would walk from one bed to another, comforting fellow patients who had also been "sentenced to death," even singing softly with his rich baritone voice. The dreaded CA ward suddenly filled with applause and laughter. Especially when his fellow patients discovered that Teacher Yu had an English textbook under his pillow and was preparing a lesson in secret, the unfortunate patients gradually became friends who encouraged each other. Indeed, the shorter life is, the more meaningful it should be.

**A Silkworm Spinning Silk in the Field of Educational Reform**

"STAND UP!" The entire class stood up almost simultaneously, each student standing tall with shining eyes. Dressed in a sharp suit, Teacher Yu solemnly gazed at the students for a moment, then began the lesson in a concise and appropriate manner. He then methodically displayed vivid charts, and the tape recorder played standard and fluent English phrases, naturally immersing the students in a lively English world. Their expressions were so focused. Yu asked a few clever questions, and the students who were stumped immediately formed groups of four to discuss, quickly resolving their doubts, followed by laughter. One knowledge point after another stood out clearly, and one skill after another was honed amidst the laughter.

The demonstration class was a success! The teachers who had come to observe the class, still buzzing with excitement, stopped Yu outside the classroom.

"Sorry," the school leaders quickly intervened, "Teacher Yu is currently in the hospital; he only took a one-hour leave."

What? No wonder the atmosphere in the class was a bit unusual! Curious onlookers couldn't help but steal glances at him: My goodness! Teacher Yu's lips were so pale, his face so yellow, and he had a strong smell of mentholated oil. It turned out that this class had been scheduled three months ago. Yu was troubled by the current middle school English teaching methods, which focused too much on grammar and translation and neglected oral skills. He decided to use this public class as an opportunity for reform. Even if he failed, he wanted to pave the way for others. After being diagnosed with a terminal illness, colleagues offered to teach according to his plan, but Yu sincerely said, "This is a risky class; it's best for me to take the risk."

Just 13 days after being discharged, Teacher Yu returned to the classroom. Before people could fully grasp this news, he dropped another bombshell: he wanted to start an experimental class for educational reform. Was he throwing caution to the wind, betting his remaining three to five years on this? Not at all. Yu had once emotionally said in a party cell meeting, "I don't want to die; I just want to live a more meaningful life. Only by working can life be beautiful, and only then will it be beneficial to my health." Indeed, his efforts paid off. Two to three years of reform made the experimental class not only excel in the annual exams but also outperform others in ability. Wu Jian won the championship in the 1983 Nanchang City Middle School English Recitation Competition. In 1984, when foreign guests from Zimbabwe visited the school, the experimental class excellently performed as junior translators and other reception tasks. The results of the experiment strengthened his belief in educational reform, and the reform made his teaching methods increasingly scientific and perfect. All of this made the English scores of the classes he later taught remarkable, such as the 86th class's average English score reaching 86.7. The first issue of *Nanchang Education* in 1985 published Yu's article, "Summary of Middle School English Educational Reform Experiment."

**A Greater Goal Ahead**

Everyone thought that Yu should be satisfied now and take some time to rest and recuperate, as he had nearly fainted by the experimental class podium several times. However, surprisingly, Yu added another heavy weight to the scale of his career versus his life—he took on the role of class advisor! He said he wanted to lead a class to be a truly qualified teacher. Others could take their time, but he must make haste. From then on, he devoted himself entirely to the class, from morning reading to extracurricular activities. In the first semester of leading the class, he hardly rested on a single Sunday, except for three students who lived in the distant suburbs, he visited every student's home. Ask yourself, how many healthy class advisors can do this? Not to mention that in addition to cancer, he also suffered from gastric sequelae from the radiation therapy, constantly tormenting him. To maintain his heavy workload, he forced himself to eat half a pound of high-protein food every day, grinding pork and fish into a paste and rolling them into pill-sized balls to swallow, as he couldn't chew; otherwise, he would vomit. He finally led a class with a unique style, where students were responsible and had a strong sense of mission. The class atmosphere was lively, and the competitiveness was strong. The 86th class was awarded the title of advanced collective for two consecutive years. In 1985, seven students won first, second, and third prizes in the National Mathematics Competition. In 1986, one student participated in the National Middle School Mathematics International Olympiad Training Team. 44 students were admitted to various colleges and universities, with a college entrance rate of 91.7%, of which 59% entered key universities. The Nanchang Municipal Education Commission's *Research on Ideological and Political Work* and *Nanchang Labor* published his teaching and educating experience.

The Party and the people highly evaluated his spirit and dedication. He was selected as an advanced worker of the school year after year, three times as an advanced teacher of the Nanchang Municipal Education System, seven times as an outstanding party member. In 1984, he was elected as an advanced individual in building socialist spiritual civilization in Jiangxi Province and an outstanding class advisor in the province and city. In 1986, he was awarded the title of advanced worker in moral education of primary and secondary schools nationwide. In 1988, he was publicly elected as the "Star Teacher" of the Nanchang region. This year, he was also selected as a model worker of the city. Radio and television reporters often came to interview him. He always pleaded, "Don't promote me as a hero or model. I am just worthy of the honorable title of people's teacher and have done what a Communist Party member should do. If there is any merit, it should be attributed to the Party's cultivation."

    一生心事在育人
    ——记优秀共产党员、南昌二中青年英语教师虞华来
    江希交
    近年来，虞老师一直是南昌二中的新闻人物。他非同一般的生活经历，使人惊诧而钦佩；他对事业执著的追求进取，给人鼓舞、启迪。
      敢于直面病魔的威胁
    1982年仲春，而立之年的虞华来的生活犹如温馨的泉水一样甘美并充满生机。从上海外语学院毕业来南昌二中仅两年，已在事业上崭露头角，被选为市中心教研组成员，又有个贤淑的妻子。谁知，病魔突然叩击幸运之门——他患了癌！只有3到5年的生存期……
    好心的人们纷纷献计献策，焦急的领导送来营养费和两张去上海的飞机票，还办好外地就医的全部事宜。小虞接到切片化验单时没流下的泪水，此刻夺眶而出，他泣不成声，在场者也无不伤感至极。小虞终于擦干泪，缓缓地说：“我，哪也不去”。不是说大话，小虞早就宣誓要为党的事业奋斗终身，现在多上一节课就多一分安慰。他马上住进了江西医学院第二附属医院，幸亏切除手术顺利，接着是做长达3个月的钴60放射治疗，小虞体内的白血球急剧下降，头晕眼花，恶心呕吐，真是坐卧不宁。可只要精神稍好一点儿，他便从这张床走到那张床，劝慰同被“判了死刑”的病友，甚至常用他浑厚的男中音轻轻地唱支歌，可怕的CA病房破天荒有了掌声与笑语。尤其当病友发现虞老师枕下压着英语课本，背着医护人员在准备一堂什么要紧的课之后，同病相怜的不幸者逐渐成了互相激励的朋友。是啊，生命越是短暂，越要活得有意义。
      教改领域吐丝的春蚕
    “STAND　UP！”全班同学几乎在同一瞬间起立，个个头正胸挺，眼里闪烁着光芒。身着一套笔挺西装的虞老师庄重地凝视了台下片刻，简洁得体地导教后，便有条不紊地展示一幅幅生动的挂图，录音机相应放出一句句标准流利的口语，同学们自然而然地进入生动的英语世界，神态是那样的专注。虞老师提了几个巧妙的问题，被难住的学生立即4人一组紧张讨论，疑窦骤解，随之笑声四起。一个个知识点就这样鲜明地被突出出来，一项项技能在笑声中得到锻炼。
    这堂全市英语观摩课成功了！余兴正浓的听课老师在教室外截住了小虞，
  “对不起”，二中领导忙过来挡驾，
  “虞老师正在住院，只请假一小时”。哦？难怪上课时的气氛有点异样！好奇的人不禁悄悄端详起他来：天哪！虞老师的嘴唇是这样白，脸是这般黄，身上还有一股极呛人的清凉油味。原来，这堂课是三个月前定下来的。小虞很苦恼现行中学英语教学死抠语法，重笔译轻口语能力，决意利用公开课作改革尝试。即使失败也要抛砖引玉。身患绝症后，同事们争相表示愿按他的设想上，可小虞真诚地说：“这是堂风险课，还是我来冒这个险最合适”。
    出院仅仅13天，虞老师又正式重返讲台。人们这儿惊疑未定，他那儿又来爆炸新闻：要搞教改实验班。莫非他破罐破摔，把生命最后的三五年孤注一掷了？其实不然。小虞在党小组里曾动情地说：“我不愿死，只想生活得更有价值，而工作着，生活才是美好的，对我的身体也才有益”。功夫到底不负苦心人，两三年的教改，使实验班不但统考时考分在年级里出类拔萃，而且能力胜人一筹。吴建同学荣获南昌市1983年中学生英语朗诵比赛冠军。1984年津巴布韦外宾来校，实验班出色地担任了小翻译和其他接待工作。实验的成果坚定了他教改的信念，而教改使他的教学方法日臻科学、完善，这一切使他日后所教班级的英语成绩非同凡响，如86届4班高考的英语平均分竟达86.7分。《南昌教育》1985年首期刊登了虞老师的《中学英语教改实验小结》。
      更有目标在前头
    人们都以为这下小虞该满足了，该歇息调养一下病体，因为他几次险些晕倒在实验班讲台边，而令人不敢相信的是虞老师在事业与生命的天平上，竟再往事业上加了块大砝码——担任班主任！他说还要会带班，才是真合格的老师。别人可以慢慢来，我必须只争朝夕。打这以后，他从早读到课外活动，全身心扑在班上，带班的第一个学期，几乎没歇过一个星期天，除了3位家住远郊的，他走访了全班学生家庭。试问，有多少健康的班主任能如此？何况他除了癌症，还有放疗的胃后遗症时时在折磨着他。为了坚持繁重的工作，他强迫自己每天进食半斤高蛋白物质，把猪肉、鱼肉等剁成泥再搓成药丸大小吞服，因为不能咀嚼，一咀嚼他就要呕吐。他终于带出有独特风格的班集体，同学们富有责任感和事业心，班风活跃，竞争力强。86届4班连续两年被评为市先进集体。1985年有7位同学荣获全国数学竞赛一、二、三等奖。1986年有1位同学参加全国中学生数学国际奥林匹克集训队。44人考取各类大专院校，升学率达91.7％，其中进入重点院校的占59％。南昌市教委主编的
  《思想政治工作研究》和《南昌工运》发表了他撰写的教书育人经验。
    党和人民高度评价他的精神与奉献，他连年当选校先进工作者，3次被评为南昌市教育系统先进教师，7次评为优秀党员。1984年当选江西省建设社会主义精神文明先进个人和省市优秀班主任，1986年荣获全国中小学德育先进工作者，1988年社会公推他为南昌地区园丁之星，今年还当选了市劳模。电台、电视台记者时常来采访他。他总是恳求道：不要把我当英雄模范去宣传，我只是无愧于人民教师的光荣称号，做了一个共产党员应该做的事情。如果有功劳，也要归功于党的培养。
