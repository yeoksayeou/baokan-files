Comrade Ren Bishi is a revered revolutionary of the proletariat. He served for a long time as a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and was one of the core members of the Central Leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. He dedicated all his energy to the cause of the Party and the people, making significant contributions. Unfortunately, shortly after the nation's liberation and moving into the city, he left us and passed away.

(One)

I first met Comrade Ren Bishi at the end of 1937.

At that time, after the Japanese army occupied Beijing and Tianjin, they madly pushed into our interior. Major cities and passes in Shanxi such as Datong, Yanmen Pass, and Niangzi Pass had fallen into enemy hands, and subsequently, Taiyuan was also occupied. I, along with the Shanxi Youth Anti-Japanese Volunteer Corps, came from the Wutai Mountains to Shun County. We were mobilizing the masses and building political power, opening up the Jin Dongnan Anti-Japanese Base Area. Comrade Ren Bishi also came with the Eighth Route Army Headquarters from the Wutai Mountains to Shun County.

When we met, I first introduced myself to him. Comrade Ren Bishi said, "No need, your situation has already been introduced by Comrades Zhu De and Liu Shaoqi. Your work with Yan Xishan to push this local force to resist Japan and establish a special form of united front is a great thing. You should constantly observe the situation, summarize experiences, and continuously push the united front forward." I said, "I often think about it too, how to best align with the Central Committee's united front policy, and I never forget the lesson of the Great Revolution where giving up leadership caused great losses. I will definitely do a good job in this work." As the conversation was about to end, I asked Comrade Ren Bishi, "At the beginning of the war of resistance, Comrade Zhou Enlai went to Taiyuan and gave a political report to the 'Military and Political Training Class,' which had a good effect. Now, please give a report to the Volunteer Corps as well." Comrade Ren Bishi agreed readily and gave a report on the situation of the war of resistance at our base (Shunzhou Tongchuan Middle School).

In his report, he said: The Japanese invaders intend to make the Chinese nation perish. The Chinese people have only one way out, which is to unite and resist Japan to the end! What impressed me the most was his special discussion on the issue of "prolonged resistance." At that time, it was still a few months before Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" was published. He said: The longer China's war of resistance against aggression lasts, the greater the power of the Chinese nation will surge, grow, and be nurtured in the prolonged resistance. The people will be more mobilized, more united, and more grown and strengthened, becoming an invincible force. Pessimism and despair are groundless. The longer the enemy's aggressive war lasts, the more difficulties they will face, and their advantages will gradually turn into disadvantages, ultimately being defeated by us. Comrade Ren Bishi's report, like Comrade Zhou Enlai's, left a deep impression on the Volunteer Corps cadres.

In August 1945, the Japanese announced their surrender. The Central Committee decided to transfer me to work in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and Military Region. Before my departure, Comrade Mao Zedong sent Comrade Ren Bishi to talk to me. Comrade Ren Bishi said: The Central Committee has decided to transfer your work. Chairman Mao asked me to come and talk to you. The Central Committee's requirements for you are to assist Liu and Deng in their work, with an important condition being to do more work on unity, to unite the local and military forces, and to unite the cadres from the original First and Fourth Front Armies. The Japanese invaders have been defeated and announced their surrender, but we must not have a peaceful illusion. We must prepare for the Nationalists and the Kuomintang to attack the liberated areas to seize the fruits of the war of resistance. As long as everyone is united, with a unified will and unified actions, we can defeat any powerful enemy. I expressed that with the correct policies and leadership of the Central Committee and Liu and Deng, the work of unity and other aspects will definitely be done well.

After arriving at the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau, I mainly focused on the work of the Central Bureau, such as party building, land reform, economic construction, military logistics and support work, mobilizing new recruits, etc. In my work, I deeply felt that there were some disagreements between the local and military forces and between different parts of the military. Within my capabilities, I did some work, such as removing a district party committee secretary and doing some work with another high-level military commander who opposed Liu and Deng. But this person never changed his attitude until his death. For all major issues decided by the Central Bureau, I reported to Liu and Deng and finally made the decision. Liu and Deng always supported my work. For example, in Anyang, there was a big tyrant named Wu Shouzhen, who was deeply hated by the people. During the land reform, tens of thousands of people wanted to struggle against him. However, some cadres defended him, saying that he had protected our people during the war of resistance. Even some high-level cadres came to plead for him. I did not agree, and they went to find Xiao Ping, who said, "You should discuss this with Comrade Bo Yibo."

Through our work, the local and military forces in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area were united. The four district party committees all consciously supported and accepted the leadership of Liu and Deng, and the broad cadres all united around them. The unity within the military was also good. The 129th Division was mainly composed of the original Fourth Front Army, along with some personnel from the original First Front Army and other units. This army, after eight years of resistance, had developed significantly and was inseparable from Comrades Bo Yibo and Xiao Ping's strong political and organizational abilities and excellent command. What impressed me the most was that they often told me: The soldiers of the Fourth Front Army were mostly of worker and peasant origin, with low cultural levels, but they loved to learn and were good at fighting. You can see that as soon as they entered the battlefield, they were all full of energy. In handling internal military relations and promoting and appointing cadres, regardless of their original unit, they always adhered to the principle of equal treatment. The Decision One Corps and the 386th Brigade formed the Taihang Corps. Liu and Deng instructed us that one was a new army from Shanxi and the other was an old Red Army, and we should do more work to acknowledge the factions and eliminate the factions. At the same time, they said that the 6th Brigade had many old cadres of worker and peasant origin with rich combat experience, while the new army had less combat experience but more intellectuals. We should exchange cadres with each other and complement each other's strengths. We followed their instructions and achieved significant results.

In January 1948, Comrade Ren Bishi gave an important report on "Several Issues in Land Reform." This report played an important role in correcting the "leftist" errors that appeared during the land reform.

In March of that year, the Central Committee came from Shaanbei to Chengnan Village in Hebei, and Comrade Ren Bishi saw me. He asked me to talk about my views on his report in conjunction with the land reform situation in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area.

I said: The land reform in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area had already achieved "the tillers owning three mu of land" (the language of the peasants at that time) before the National Land Conference. Although the entire area had also experienced a "leftist" tendency, generally speaking, the policy was still relatively stable. We emphasized not infringing on the interests of middle peasants, especially the policy boundary of not touching the rich middle peasants; we emphasized the policy boundary of protecting industry and commerce; in dealing with some district and village cadres who occupied more land and distributed more fruits and their work style, we opposed punishment and emphasized the self-awareness of the cadres, letting them voluntarily withdraw and correct themselves. In this way, the problem was solved without damaging their revolutionary enthusiasm. In April 1947, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu "People's Daily" published an editorial titled "Salute to District and Village Cadres," emphasizing the contradictions between cadres and the masses, "which are internal contradictions within the revolutionary camp, fundamentally different from the contradictions between peasants and landlords, and cannot be confused." If the two different types of contradictions are confused, "painful to friends and pleasing to enemies" will be done. At that time, some individual liberated areas in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu also appeared with some very "leftist" tendencies, even serious errors, but generally, it was not the mainstream. At the National Land Conference, there were debates on the above-mentioned policies. At that time, Kang Sheng, in response to my emphasis on not infringing on the interests of middle peasants, criticized me, saying that it was wrong, that it could not mobilize the masses, that not moving the middle peasants was right, and that moving the middle peasants was not "left"; to satisfy the demands of the masses, to distribute floating property, and to move industry and commerce was also possible; he portrayed the district and village cadres as completely black, not "saluting them," but should "remove them." I disagreed with his remarks and stood up to him. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Shaoqi agreed with our views. However, the main idea of the meeting was still anti-right. Before I returned to Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, I specially asked Comrade Liu Shaoqi for instructions: The land reform problems in our area have been summarized, which I have all mentioned in my speech at the meeting. We are eliminating "leftist" errors. Now the meeting decides that the whole country should be anti-right. We in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu have been too "left," and we should mainly be anti-"left." How should we do it? He replied that he completely agreed. But in fact, when I returned to the Central Bureau, the "leftist" atmosphere of the meeting had already spread widely, so that the above-mentioned policy boundaries did not take effect, and the "leftist" tendency became more and more serious, becoming the main and widespread tendency. Finally, I told Comrade Ren Bishi: Your report is very good and completely in line with the actual situation of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area. This shows that in guiding such a large-scale mass struggle as land reform, it is necessary to pay close attention to the development trend, strengthen policy guidance, discover error tendencies, and correct them in time to prevent their spread. What Comrade Mao Zedong said, that the party's policies and strategies are the party's lifeblood, is absolutely true.

In the process of implementing Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Issues in Land Reform," the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau issued four consecutive documents, which were affirmed by the Central Committee. One of them was my "Report on the Development of Industry and Commerce," mainly to review our "leftist" errors in implementing the policy of industry and commerce, that is, we also "moved industry and commerce." Comrade Mao Zedong thought the report was good and forwarded it to various Central Bureaus and Sub-Bureaus for reference and implementation. When talking with Chairman Mao in Chengnan Village, I said, "We made many mistakes, especially in infringing on industry and commerce." Chairman Mao said, "Yes, there were serious errors." After a while, he said, "But it is still 'three-seven,' the achievements are the main part."

(Four)

In March 1949, after the Central Committee moved from Xibaipo to Beijing, one day, the Secretariat held a meeting, and Comrade Ren Bishi notified me to attend. At that time, I was the first secretary of the North China Bureau and thought the meeting would definitely discuss the work of the North China Bureau, so I prepared the report points. However, the meeting did not touch on the affairs of the North China Bureau, and I was a bit puzzled.

After the meeting, Comrade Ren Bishi talked to me and conveyed the opinions of the Central Committee. He said: The Central Committee decided that you should attend the Secretariat meetings in the future. I said: I am not qualified. Comrade Ren Bishi said: We have considered it, and you are qualified. I replied: I am afraid the Central Committee's estimation of me is too high, "the reality does not match the reputation."

Whenever I think of Comrade Ren Bishi, I often recall these incidents from 40 years ago. I record these events simply to express my respect and remembrance for Comrade Ren Bishi once again.

    忆任弼时同志二三事
    薄一波
    任弼时同志是全党景仰的无产阶级革命家。他长期任中共中央书记处书记，是以毛泽东同志为核心的中央领导成员之一。他把自己的全部精力倾注于党和人民的事业，为之作出了很大贡献。可惜，全国解放，进城不久，他就离开我们，与世长辞了。
    （一）
    我初识弼时同志是在1937年底。
    那时，日军占领北平、天津后，疯狂向我内地推进，山西的大同、雁门关、娘子关等重镇和关隘已落入敌手，随后太原也遭沦陷。我跟山西青年抗敌决死队从五台山地区来到沁县，我们正在发动群众，进行政权建设，开辟晋东南抗日根据地。弼时同志，也同八路军总部一起从五台山地区来到沁县。
    见面时，我首先向他作自我介绍，弼时同志就说：不用了，你的情况朱德、刘少奇同志已经介绍过，你和阎锡山打交道，推动这个地方实力派抗日，同他建立起特殊形式的统一战线，这是件大好事，要经常观察形势，总结经验，不断把统一战线推向前进。我说，我也时常思索，到底怎样做才更合乎中央统一战线政策的要求，也时时不忘记大革命时在国民革命联合阵线中放弃领导权给革命带来重大损失的教训，我一定努力把这个工作做好。在谈话快结尾时，我向弼时同志提出，抗战初始，周恩来同志到太原，请他给“军政训练班”作过一次政治报告，效果很好。现在请你也给决死队讲一次吧。弼时同志欣然答应，就在我们的驻地（沁州同川中学）作了一次关于抗战形势的报告。
    他在报告中说：日本侵略者妄图使中华民族亡国灭种。中国人民只能有一条出路，就是团结抗日，奋战到底！给我印象最深的，是他专门论述了“持久抗战”的问题，此时距毛泽东同志的《论持久战》发表还有数月。他说：中国抵抗侵略的战争愈持久，中华民族的伟大力量就在持久抗战中愈涌现、滋长、生息、培育起来，人民就会愈发动、愈团结、愈成长壮大，成为不可战胜的力量，悲观与失望是毫无根据的。而敌人的侵略战争愈延长，其困难就会愈增加，其优势就会渐渐变为劣势，最终被我们所战胜。弼时同志的报告和恩来同志的报告一样，给我们决死队干部留下的印象极为深刻。
    （二）
    1945年8月，日寇宣布投降。中央决定我调晋冀鲁豫中央局、军区工作，临行前，毛泽东同志派任弼时同志找我谈话。弼时同志说：中央决定调动你的工作，毛主席要我来跟你谈谈。毛主席和中央对你的要求是，协助刘、邓做好工作，其中重要的一条是多做团结工作，搞好地方与军队的团结，搞好军队原一、四方面军干部之间的团结。日本侵略者已被打垮、宣布投降，但我们不能有和平麻痹思想，要准备蒋介石、国民党向解放区进攻，来夺取抗战胜利果实。只要大家团结一致，统一意志，统一行动，我们就能战胜任何强大的敌人。我表示，有中央正确的方针、政策，又有刘、邓的领导，团结以及其他各项工作一定能做好。
    到晋冀鲁豫中央局后，我主要是抓中央局的工作，诸如党的建设、土地改革、经济建设、军队后勤和支前工作、动员新兵入伍等等。我在工作中，深深感到地方与部队、部队内部这部分与那部分干部之间是有一些意见的。我在力所能及的范围内做了一些工作，曾撤掉一位区党委书记，对另一位反刘、邓的高级军事指挥员也做了一些工作。但此人至死也没有改变态度。凡由中央局决策的重要问题，我都请示报告刘、邓，最后定案。刘、邓也总是支持我的工作。举一个小例子，很可说明一般，安阳有一个大恶霸叫吴守珍，民愤极大，土改中几万群众要斗争他。但是，有的干部却为他辩护，说他在抗战中掩护过我们的人，甚至有的高级干部也跑来找我为他说情，我没有答应，他们就去找小平，小平回答说：你们去找一波同志商量嘛。
    经过做工作，晋冀鲁豫区地方与军队是团结的，四个区党委都自觉拥护和接受刘、邓的领导，广大干部都团结在他们周围。部队内部的团结也很好。一二九师，是以原红四方面军为主，加上原红一方面军及其它部队的部分人员组成的。这支军队经过八年抗战，得到很大发展，是与伯承、小平同志政治组织能力强、作战指挥高明，并且注意团结分不开的。我印象最深刻的是，他们曾多次向我说：四方面军的指战员多是工农出身，文化程度不高，但爱学习，很会打仗，你看他们一进入阵地，都一个个生龙活虎的，他们在处理部队内部关系和任用提拔干部上，不管原来是哪个部队的，始终坚持一视同仁、平等对待的原则。决死一纵队和三八六旅组成太岳纵队，刘、邓曾指示我们，一个是山西新军，一个是老红军，要搞好团结，要在承认山头，消灭山头上多做工作。同时，他们又说，六旅中工农出身的老干部多，战斗经验丰富，新军战斗经验差，但知识分子多，互相之间要交流干部，取长补短。我们按照他们的指示做了，成效显著。
    （三）
    1948年1月，弼时同志作了《土地改革中的几个问题》的重要报告。这个报告对纠正土改中出现的“左”倾错误起了重要作用。
    这年3月，党中央从陕北来到河北的城南庄时，弼时同志见到我，要我结合晋冀鲁豫区土改情况，谈谈对他这个报告的看法。
    我说：晋冀鲁豫区的土改，在全国土地会议以前，已实现了“耕者有其三亩田”（当时农民的语言），虽然全区也曾经普遍发生过“左”的偏向，但就整体来说，掌握政策一般还是比较稳的。我们强调不侵犯中农利益，特别是不动富裕中农的政策界限；强调保护工商业的政策界限；在处理一些区、村干部多占土地和多分果实以及他们的工作作风问题上，我们反对搞惩办主义，注意启发干部的自觉性，让他们主动退出，自觉改正，这样既解决了问题，又不伤害他们的革命积极性。1947年4月晋冀鲁豫《人民日报》发表了一篇《向区村干部致敬》的社论，强调干群之间的矛盾，“是革命阵营内部的矛盾，它和农民与地主之间的矛盾有根本区别，不能混为一谈”。如果把两种不同性质的矛盾混为一谈，就会做出“亲痛仇快”的事。当时晋冀鲁豫个别解放区土改也出现过一些很“左”的偏向，甚至是很严重的错误，但一般来说还不是主流。在全国土地会议上，对上面提到的几条政策是有争论的。当时，康生针对我强调的不能侵犯中农利益，批评我说得不对，他说发动不起群众来，不动中农也是右，发动起群众来，动了中农也不是“左”；为了满足群众的要求，分浮财，动点工商业，也是可以的；他把区村干部描绘得一团漆黑，不是“向他们致敬”，而是应该把他们“搬掉”。我不同意他的说法，顶了起来。会上，少奇同志同意我们的意见。但是，会议主导思想还是反右。我返回晋冀鲁豫前，特向少奇同志请示：我区土改问题已作总结，这我在会议的发言中都讲过了。我们正在消除“左”的错误。现在会议决定全国都反右，我们晋冀鲁豫已经够“左”了，我们主要应该是反“左”，怎么样？他回答完全同意。但实际上等我回到中央局，会议上“左”的气氛早已普遍传开，以致上述几条政策界限没有起作用，“左”的倾向愈演愈烈，成为带普遍性的主要倾向。最后，我对弼时同志说：你这个报告做得很好，完全合乎晋冀鲁豫区的实际情况。这说明，指导像土改这样大的群众斗争，必须密切注意发展趋势，加强政策指导，发现错误苗头，就要当机立断，及时纠正，不使其蔓延开来。毛泽东同志所说的，党的政策和策略是党的生命，千真万确。
    在贯彻落实弼时同志的《土地改革中的几个问题》的过程中，晋冀鲁豫中央局曾连续发出四个文件，得到中央的肯定。其中一个是我的《关于发展工商业的报告》，主要是检讨我们在执行工商业政策中发生的“左”倾错误，就是说，我们也“动了工商业”。毛泽东同志认为报告很好，批转各中央局、中央分局研究和参照办理。在城南庄与毛主席谈话时，我说，我们犯了不少错误，特别是在侵犯工商业问题上。毛主席说，对，是有严重错误的。停了一会儿又说，但还是“三七开”，成绩是主要的。
    （四）
    1949年3月，党中央机关从西柏坡迁到北平以后，有一天，中央书记处开会，弼时同志通知我列席会议。我当时是华北局第一书记，以为会上一定是研究华北局的工作，让我列席。我准备了汇报要点，但会议并未涉及华北局的事，我有些纳闷。
    会后，弼时同志找我谈话，向我传达了中央的意见。他说：中央决定，让你以后列席书记处会议。我说：不够格。弼时同志说：我们考虑过了，够格。我回答说：恐怕中央对我的估计高了，“其实不副”。
    我每每想起弼时同志，就常常记起这些40年前的往事来。我记下这些事，无非是再一次表达我对弼时同志的崇敬、缅怀之情。
