Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 2nd.

North Korea's *Rodong Sinmun* published an article criticizing the U.S. for slandering socialist countries and attempting to restore capitalism within them.

The article states that in the current phase, the U.S.'s anti-communist, anti-socialist strategy is particularly noteworthy for its strengthening of internal sabotage activities against socialist countries. They claim that the "most opportune moment" to restore capitalism in socialist countries without firing a shot has arrived. They slander and defame socialist countries that have taken a series of revolutionary measures to uphold the socialist system, claiming that these countries "trample on human rights," and infringe upon "freedom" and "democracy."

The article points out that the U.S.'s conspiracy is to lead socialist countries down the capitalist path and to pick them off one by one. The U.S.'s open hostility towards socialism and communism permeates the political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural spheres. The article states that in the face of such a situation, socialist countries must firmly uphold the socialist cause, smash anti-communist, anti-socialist conspiracies, and resolutely fight to defend socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 2nd.

The Soviet Union's *Pravda* today published an article criticizing "Voice of America" and other Western media outlets for publishing provocative materials aimed at sabotaging the Soviet Union.

The article, titled "Instigators," written by the newspaper's political commentator Zhukov, states that due to the complex situation in the three Baltic republics along the Soviet Union's Baltic coast, the BBC, "Deutsche Welle," and "Voice of America" have significantly increased their coverage of the situation in this region, with the most significant increase being in Russian-language broadcasts.

The article states that the broadcasts contain more and more insinuations, aiming to provide justification for the three Baltic republics to secede from the Soviet Union. The coverage by the American Columbia Broadcasting System even incites armed struggle. The article continues, saying that the instigators are trying every means to shift the blame for inciting national hatred onto Moscow, onto the "center," and ultimately onto the Soviet Union's media, primarily onto the editorial board of *Pravda*. The author believes that the actions of some Western radio stations against the Soviet Union are aimed at further stirring up dissatisfaction with the "center," inciting people to oppose the party's newspapers, and portraying extremists as innocent victims of the "center."

    苏报批评西方新闻媒介对苏进行破坏活动
    新华社平壤9月2日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》发表文章，对美国诽谤中伤社会主义国家、妄图在社会主义国家搞资本主义复辟的行径进行了抨击。
    文章说，现阶段，美国反共反社会主义的战略特别引人注目的是正在加强从内部对社会主义国家进行破坏活动。他们叫嚷在没有炮声的情况下，在社会主义国家复辟资本主义的“最适当机会”已经到来。他们诽谤中伤为坚持社会主义制度而采取一系列革命措施的社会主义国家，叫嚷什么这些国家“践踏人权”、侵犯“自由”和“民主”。
    文章指出，美国这一阴谋在于把社会主义国家引上资本主义道路，对社会主义国家进行各个击破。美国对社会主义、共产主义的露骨敌视涉及到政治、经济、外交、文化各个领域。文章说，面对这样的形势，社会主义国家必须牢牢地坚持社会主义事业，粉碎反共反社会主义的阴谋。为维护社会主义进行坚决的斗争。
    新华社莫斯科9月2日电苏联《真理报》今天载文抨击“美国之音”和其他一些西方新闻媒介发表挑唆性材料，企图对苏联进行破坏活动。
    由该报政治评论员茹科夫撰写的题为《教唆犯》的文章说，最近由于苏联波罗的海沿岸3个共和国局势复杂，英国广播公司、“德意志电波”和“美国之音”等大量增加了有关这个地区形势的报道，其中以俄语广播的消息增加最多。
    文章说，这些广播中的暗示愈来愈多，目的在于为波罗的海沿岸3个共和国脱离苏联“提供论据”。美国哥伦比亚广播公司的报道甚至教唆人们去进行武装斗争。文章接着说，教唆犯千方百计将煽动民族仇恨的责任推给莫斯科，推给“中央”，最终是推给苏联的新闻媒介，首先是推给《真理报》编辑部。作者认为，西方一些电台对苏联的这些做法，目的是进一步挑起对“中央”的不满情绪，唆使人们去反对党的报刊，而把极端分子描述成是“中央”无辜的受害者。
