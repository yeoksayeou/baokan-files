The Youth Games ball games have mostly concluded or the situation is clear, with the remaining events entering the final stage of competition.

Football: In Group A, the Beijing team utilized a low cross in the second half to barely break the deadlock against the Guangdong team, but the referee called it offside, resulting in a 0-0 draw. This result cost the Beijing youngsters the initiative to advance. The Liaoning team then narrowly avoided elimination by the Shanghai team, with both sides ending the match at 1-1. The Liaoning team advanced with a goal difference of 1, edging out the Beijing team. In Group B, the Jiangsu team and the Henan team played to a 0-0 draw, allowing Jiangsu to advance with two 0-0 draws. Tomorrow's semifinals will see Guangdong face Jiangsu, and Liaoning against Tianjin.

Table Tennis: The Henan team secured victory over the Beijing team in their final match, becoming the women's team champions. The main player, Deng Yaping, maintained a perfect record. The Shandong men's team relaxed in the ninth game, allowing Tianjin's penholder, Xu Kai, to turn the tables and snatch the team championship. The Beijing women's team and the Shandong men's team won the team silver medals. The five individual events will begin this evening.

Tennis: After four days of continuous matches, the team competition concluded on the 10th. The men's and women's team champions are Jiangsu and Hunan, respectively, with both silver medals going to the Shanghai team.

Water Polo: The two undefeated southern powerhouses faced off this afternoon at the Shenyang Swimming Stadium. The steady Guangdong team waited for the Guangxi team to tire before launching a series of long-range shots, scoring consecutively to defeat their opponents 12-8 and claim the championship.

Basketball: The host Liaoning women's team defeated Fujian 130-80 this afternoon, securing the gold medal in the women's basketball competition.

　　青运会球类比赛进入高潮
　　乒乓球网球团体、水球女篮已见分晓
    本报沈阳9月12日电　记者汪大昭、黄振中报道：青运会球类比赛多数已见分晓或形势明朗，其余各项角逐进入最后争夺阶段。
    足球，A组的北京队利用下半时一次落底回敲，好不容易打破广东队大门，但裁判员宣布越位而无效，0∶0的结果使北京小将失去了出线主动权。辽宁队随后险些被上海队淘汰，双方战成1∶1，辽宁队以净胜球多1个的成绩挤掉了北京队而出线。B组江苏队与河南队踢成0∶0，江苏队遂以两个0∶0的战绩进入四强。明天的半决赛，广东队迎战江苏队，辽宁队对天津队。
    乒乓球，河南队在最后一战取胜北京队，成为女子团体赛冠军，主将邓亚萍保持了全胜纪录。山东男队在第九盘一度放松，被天津队横拍削球手徐凯反败为胜，眼看着到手的团体赛冠军被天津队抢走。北京女队、山东男队分获团体赛亚军。今晚将开始五个单项比赛。
    网球，经过四天连续交锋，团体赛已于10日结束。男女团体冠军分别是江苏和湖南队，两项亚军都落在上海队手中。
    水球，两支保持不败的南国劲旅今天下午在沈阳游泳馆决战。稳健的广东队待广西队体力消耗后频频远射，接连得分，以12∶8击败对手获冠军。
    篮球，东道主辽宁女篮今天下午以130∶80战胜福建队，获得女篮比赛金牌。
