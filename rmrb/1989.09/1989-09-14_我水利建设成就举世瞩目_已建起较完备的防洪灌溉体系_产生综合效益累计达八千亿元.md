China's billion farmers, with the spirit of moving mountains and transforming rivers like the mythical Yu Gong, have built a relatively complete flood control and irrigation system over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. With over 100 billion yuan of state investment, year after year, they have been working on water and soil conservation, land reclamation, and have created a comprehensive benefit of 800 billion yuan.

Over the past 40 years, China has built and repaired 170,000 kilometers of river dikes, protecting more than half of the country's population who are frequently threatened by floods and safeguarding regions where agricultural and industrial output accounts for more than two-thirds of the national total.

In the past 40 years, more than 80,000 reservoirs of various types have been built nationwide, with a total storage capacity of over 450 billion cubic meters. More than 5,300 large-scale irrigation districts, each covering more than 100,000 mu (approximately 6,667 hectares), are scattered across the country, initially changing the situation where agricultural production was dependent on the weather. The cumulative increase in grain production has reached 560 billion kilograms.

While constructing flood control and irrigation projects, local authorities have fully developed hydropower resources from rivers. They have built 120 large and medium-sized hydropower stations with a capacity of more than 50,000 kilowatts each. The total installed capacity of hydropower nationwide has reached 32.7 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of over 100 billion kilowatt-hours.

　　我水利建设成就举世瞩目
　　已建起较完备的防洪灌溉体系
　　产生综合效益累计达八千亿元
    据新华社北京9月14日电　（记者黄正根、赵鹏）我国亿万农民发扬愚公移山，改造山河的英雄气概，建国40年来在国家投资1000多亿元强有力的支援下，年复一年地治山治水，改土造田，已建立起较为完备的防洪灌溉体系，17万公里的堤防抗御着江河洪水，8万多座水库灌溉着数亿亩农田，由此产生的综合效益累计达8000 亿元。
    建国40年来我国整修新建的17万公里江河堤防防洪体系，保卫了经常遭受洪水威胁的全国一半以上人口和工农业总产值占全国2／3以上地区的安全。
    40年来，全国已建成各种水库8万多座，总库容4500多亿立方米；5300多座万亩以上大型灌区遍布各地，初步改变了“旱涝望天收”的状况，累计增产粮食达5600亿公斤。
    各地在兴修防洪、灌溉工程的同时，充分开发江河水能资源，已建成5万千瓦以上大中型水电站120座，全国水电总装机容量达3270万千瓦，年发电量1000多亿度。
