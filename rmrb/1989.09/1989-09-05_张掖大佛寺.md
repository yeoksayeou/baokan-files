Upon entering the "Golden Zhangye" in Gansu, one encounters the renowned Great Buddha Temple. Upon entering the gate, two ancient cypress trees stand like stern sentinels in the courtyard. Between these "sentinels," a path leads straight to a large hall constructed of earth and wood, where the great Buddha lies. Upon hurriedly entering, one sees the reclining Buddha, Sakyamuni, lying on his side with his right hand under his head and his left hand resting by his side. The words "Auspicious Sea of Clouds" are inscribed on his chest. The sculpture is natural and the lines are soft and full. The reclining Buddha is made of a wooden frame and clay, adorned with gold and painted in vivid colors. It is 34.5 meters long, 7.5 meters wide at the shoulders, 4 meters long at the feet, and the ears are over 2 meters long. A person can lie down on the middle finger. It is the largest indoor reclining Buddha in the country. Above the hall's door, there is a couplet: "Seeing it, it seems awake; calling it, it seems asleep." The Italian traveler Marco Polo also devoted considerable ink to praising this reclining Buddha in his travelogue.

The Great Buddha Temple in Zhangye was originally built in the first year of the Yong'an reign of the Western Xia dynasty (1098 AD). It was originally named the Kasyapa Buddha Temple, later renamed the Treasure Awakening Temple, and then the Benevolent Ren Temple. Now it is called the Great Buddha Temple. The original temple was quite large, but now only the Buddha Hall remains. The Buddha Hall has two levels, with a total area of 1,370 square meters. In the past, incense smoke was ever-present, and many devout Buddhist royalty and nobles visited. A queen of the Western Xia once resided here. The mother of Kublai Khan, Borokhjin Khatun, also lived in this temple and gave birth to Kublai Khan here. After Borokhjin Khatun's death, Kublai Khan had her coffin placed in the temple. The Buddha has weathered many storms and has suffered damage in several places. After being repaired in 1981, it now looks brand new. More than ten years ago, cultural relics workers discovered gold plaques, bronze mirrors, stone tablets, and two large bronze pots hidden inside the Buddha during a renovation.

    张掖大佛寺

    在甘肃的“金张掖”有一座大佛寺，远近闻名。进得门来，大院中两棵古柏像是两个威严的门卫。“门卫”中间的甬路直通一栋土木结构的大殿，大佛就卧于此殿中。急步入内，但见释迦牟尼侧身而卧，右手枕于头下，左手顺放腿侧，胸前刻有“吉祥海云”的字样。造型自然，线条柔和丰满。卧佛为木胎泥塑，金装彩绘，身长三十四点五米，肩宽七点五米，脚长四米，耳朵两米有余，中指可睡一人，是全国最大的室内卧佛。在殿门还可看到一副对联：“视之若醒，呼之则寐。”意大利旅游家马可·波罗在他的游记中也用大量笔墨赞美这座卧佛。
    张掖大佛寺始建于西夏永安元年（公元一○九八年），原名迦叶如来寺，后又改称宝觉寺，宏仁寺，现叫大佛寺。原寺规模较大，现在只剩下大佛殿。大佛殿共两层，总面积一千三百七十平方米。从前这里曾香火不断，笃信佛教的王公贵族也多有光临。西夏有位太后就曾在这里居住。元世祖忽必烈的母亲别吉太后也曾住在这个寺内，并在这里生下忽必烈。别吉太后死后，忽必烈又将太后灵柩厝于寺内。大佛几经沧桑，已有多处损伤。一九八一年整修后，现已焕然一新。十多年前，文物工作者还在大佛身内发现了当年重修者秘藏的金牌、铜镜、石碑及两个大型铜壶。
