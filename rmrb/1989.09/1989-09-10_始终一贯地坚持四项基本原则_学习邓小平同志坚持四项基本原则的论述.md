The Four Cardinal Principles, which include upholding the socialist road, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the Communist Party, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, were first proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the Party's Theoretical Work Conference in March 1979. He subsequently elaborated on this issue in various contexts. Why do we need to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles? What is the essence of the Four Cardinal Principles? How can we persistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles? Relearning Comrade Deng Xiaoping's relevant statements and clarifying these issues is of great importance.

The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our state and must be upheld without wavering

Why do we need to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles? The most important reason is that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our state. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "The Four Cardinal Principles are not new; they are what our Party has consistently upheld." (From "Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and Oppose Bourgeois Liberalization," page 11. Subsequent page references are omitted.) Since its inception, our Party has taken Marxism as its guiding ideology, has written the great ideals of socialism and communism on its banner, has taken the establishment of a people's democratic dictatorship through a people's democratic revolution as its program of action, and has represented the awakened working class in shouldering the historical mission of leading the Chinese revolution. After the founding of the nation, the first constitution of the People's Republic of China clearly affirmed the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people's democratic dictatorship, and the socialist road. The Four Cardinal Principles are the crystallization of the basic experience of China's socialist revolution and construction, and are the fundamental principles for our state and the unity of the Chinese people in their struggle.

Next, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is the fundamental prerequisite and guarantee for achieving the Four Modernizations in China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out that the Four Modernizations we are pursuing have a name: socialist Four Modernizations. He repeatedly explained that China's Four Modernizations can only be achieved through the socialist road; pursuing capitalism will not work. In China, to achieve the Four Modernizations, we must uphold and develop the socialist public ownership economy and make the entire Chinese people prosperous. On the other hand, for China to achieve the Four Modernizations, it is impossible without a stable and united political situation. If the Four Cardinal Principles are shaken, our society will become a society in turmoil, and all talk of construction, reform, and revitalizing China will become empty words.

Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is also determined by the specific situation both domestically and internationally: there are those who attempt to shake these principles both domestically and internationally. Domestically, on the one hand, some comrades within the Party have been deeply poisoned by the ultra-leftist ideology of the Gang of Four, with a few even attacking the Party Central Committee for deviating from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought since the smashing of the Gang of Four, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. On the other hand, a few people in society are spreading doubts or opposition to the Four Cardinal Principles, and some comrades within the Party not only do not acknowledge the danger of this trend but even directly or indirectly support it to some extent. Although the number of people spreading this erroneous trend is small, we cannot ignore their influence because they are in the minority. Experience has shown that they have not only been able to but have already caused great harm to our cause. In certain situations, the so-called "democratic faction" that openly opposes the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party, along with the remnants of the Gang of Four, criminal gangs, and other social dregs, can completely join forces to become a destructive force, causing significant turmoil and loss. The recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing once again fully proved this. Internationally, some discussions in Hong Kong and Taiwan oppose our Four Cardinal Principles and advocate for us to adopt the entire set of capitalist systems. Western imperialist forces also aim to bring socialism into the capitalist orbit.

It is precisely for the above reasons that Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that to achieve the Four Modernizations, we must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles. On this fundamental issue of principle, there must be no wavering. If any of the Four Cardinal Principles are shaken, then the entire socialist cause and the entire cause of modernization construction will be shaken.

Only socialism can save China, only socialism can develop China

The most fundamental aspect of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is to uphold the leadership of the Party and the socialist road. Why do we need to uphold the socialist road? Comrade Deng Xiaoping answered the following main questions.

First, apart from the socialist road, does China have any other path to take? On this, Comrade Deng Xiaoping used a century of modern history to prove the historical inevitability of socialism in China. He said that after the Opium War of 1840, China fell into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. From then on, many enlightened individuals in China, including Sun Yat-sen, sought a way out for China. Sun Yat-sen initially wanted to learn from the West. Later, Sun Yat-sen felt that capitalist Western countries were not the way, proposing to "learn from Russia" and learn from the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, beginning the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, leading to the victory of the Northern Expedition. After Sun Yat-sen's death, the Kuomintang's rule continued to make China a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and during the Japanese invasion, it added a colonial society, and also formed and developed bureaucratic capitalism, continuing China's poverty. This history tells us that China's capitalist road will not work; China has no other path but the socialist road. If China deviates from socialism, it will inevitably return to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state. Only socialism can save China; this is the unshakable historical conclusion that the Chinese people have drawn from their personal experiences from the May Fourth Movement to the present.

Second, which is better, the socialist system or the capitalist system? Comrade Deng Xiaoping answered: of course, socialism is better. The socialist economy is based on public ownership, with production aimed at maximizing the satisfaction of the people's material and cultural needs, rather than for exploitation. The socialist system enables the Chinese people to have a common political, economic, and social ideal, and a common moral standard. All of the above, capitalist society will never have. No matter what, capitalism cannot escape the super profits of millionaires, cannot escape exploitation and plunder. The socialist system that our Party and people have fought for with blood and sweat, although not yet perfect, is still much better than the capitalist system of the law of the jungle and selfishness. Our system will become more perfect day by day, it will absorb the progressive elements that we can absorb from all countries in the world, and become the best system in the world. This is something that capitalism can never achieve. The socialist revolution has greatly narrowed the gap between China and developed capitalist countries in economic development. Although we have made some mistakes, we have still achieved progress in the past three to four decades that old China never achieved in several hundred or even several thousand years. Our economic construction has had a relatively fast development speed. Now we have summarized our experience, corrected our mistakes, and undoubtedly we will develop faster and more stably and sustainably than any capitalist country.

Third, what does China's development depend on? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's answer: only socialism can save China, only socialism can develop China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping believed that what kind of country China is and what kind of country it will develop into are the most fundamental things that determine China's development path. He pointed out that to achieve the Four Modernizations in China, at least two important characteristics must be seen: one is a weak foundation; the other is a large population and little arable land. In China's current backward state, how to develop productive forces and improve people's lives? This requires socialism; capitalism will not work. Because we need to solve the problem of food, employment, and the problem of China's reunification. China has a population of one billion, and it is still in a backward state. If we take the capitalist road, it is possible that in some local areas a few people will get rich faster, forming a new bourgeoisie and producing a batch of millionaires, but at most it will not reach one percent of the population, while the majority of people will still not be able to escape poverty, and may not even be able to solve the problem of basic sustenance, and there will also be serious employment problems. He proposed that China's lowest development goal is to achieve a moderately prosperous society by the end of this century, with a per capita GDP of 800 US dollars. Calculated for 1.2 billion people, this means a total GDP of one trillion US dollars. According to the socialist distribution principle, it can make the entire Chinese people generally achieve a moderately prosperous state. This is the reason why we must uphold socialism.

Only socialism can develop China, and it is also determined by China's position in the world political and economic pattern. For a country to break free from foreign oppression and achieve independence and self-reliance is the prerequisite for development. This is especially important for a country like China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping believed that the modern world no longer has the conditions for the free development of capitalism, and the entire international market is full. If we do not uphold socialism, even if we eventually develop, we will only become a vassal state, and it will not be easy to develop. Now China is still poor, but it occupies an important position in the world and plays a pivotal role. Why is there such a great influence? It is because China is an independent and self-reliant country. Why do we say we are independent and self-reliant? It is because we uphold the socialist road. Otherwise, we would only have to act according to the will of developed capitalist countries, and there would be no independence or development to speak of!

Fourth, why has the superiority of our socialist system not been fully demonstrated? Regarding this issue, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the socialist system is not equal to the specific methods of building socialism. The socialist system is a good system. Although we have made mistakes in building socialism, overall, we have changed the face of China. The reason why socialist countries also make mistakes in certain situations, even to the extent of the serious setbacks caused by the destruction of the Gang of Four, is undoubtedly due to subjective reasons, but the fundamental reason is the long-term historical legacy of the old society. We indeed lack experience, and perhaps we are now seriously exploring a better path. But no matter what, the superiority of the socialist system has been proven, but it needs to be proven more and more strongly. We must and will use a large amount of facts in the future to prove that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.

The Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause, without the Party's leadership there would be nothing in modern China

The core of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is to uphold the Party's leadership. Why do we need to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China? Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that in a country like China, to unite the thoughts and strength of 1 billion people to build socialism, without a party composed of highly conscious, disciplined, and self-sacrificing members who can truly represent and unite the people, without the unified leadership of the Communist Party of China, it is unimaginable, it would only lead to disintegration and failure. Our people's unity, social stability, democratic development, and national unity all depend on the Party's leadership.

Why do we say that the Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause? Because our Party is a party guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a vanguard force of the proletariat with socialist and communist consciousness and revolutionary discipline. This determines that it must be the core force leading the socialist cause and proletarian dictatorship.

The leadership position of the Communist Party of China in the socialist cause of China has been formed through decades of struggle. In China, in the several decades since the May Fourth Movement, apart from the Communist Party of China, there has not been another party like the one Lenin spoke of that is connected with the broad masses of workers. Because of the Party's leadership, the Chinese people, after countless struggles, finally established the People's Republic of China. China has always been called a loose sand, but since our Party became the ruling party and the core force for national unity, the situation of disintegration and each faction ruling its own territory has ended. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that we should not underestimate our Party. Without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new socialist China. Fundamentally, without the Party's leadership, there would be nothing in modern China.

In the past, we achieved victory relying on the Party's leadership, but can the socialist modernization cause today be separated from the Party's leadership? Comrade Deng Xiaoping answered that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, who will organize the socialist economy, politics, military, and culture? Who will organize China's Four Modernizations? In today's China, it is absolutely not appropriate to sing the praises of the spontaneity of the masses while separating from the Party's leadership. Weakening or even abolishing the Party's leadership will actually only lead to anarchism, leading to the disintegration and collapse of the socialist cause. He also pointed out that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party, through rectification, has had correct ideological, political, and organizational lines, and through gradual exploration, has begun to find a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. As long as the Party's leadership is correct, it will not only be able to concentrate the strength of the entire Party but also the strength of the entire Chinese people, and accomplish great deeds.

Can China adopt a multi-party system? Comrade Deng Xiaoping answered that what are the advantages of the multi-party system in capitalist countries? That multi-party system is determined by the state of mutual struggle among the bourgeoisie, and none of them represent the interests of the broad masses of workers. This situation is their weakness, not their strength, which makes it impossible for the strength of each country to be fully concentrated, and a large part of the strength is mutually restrained and canceled out. He firmly stated that China will absolutely not copy the multi-party system of the West. China is led by the Communist Party, and China's socialist modernization construction is led by the Communist Party; this principle is unshakable; if it is shaken, China will retrogress to division and chaos, and it will be impossible to achieve modernization.

How do we view the mistakes and errors that the Communist Party of China has made? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that overall, the history of our Party is a glorious history. Our Party has also made serious mistakes, but these mistakes have always been corrected by the Party itself, not by other forces. Even the smashing of the Gang of Four was achieved by our Party representing the interests and demands of the people. In our future work, we will strive to do things more correctly, or strive to make fewer mistakes, avoid major setbacks and major mistakes, and correct mistakes as soon as possible. We are confident that the Party Central Committee will be able to do this. China's modernization construction needs our Party, and China's important position in international struggles and the advancement of the cause of human progress needs our Party. We must uphold the Party's leadership, improve the Party's leadership, strengthen the Party's discipline and combat effectiveness, and enable our Party to be up to the great leadership responsibility for the entire country and all ethnic groups.

Strengthen the propaganda and education of the Four Cardinal Principles, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization

How do we uphold the Four Cardinal Principles? Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly pointed out that first, we must strengthen the propaganda and education of the Four Cardinal Principles, vigorously propagate the superiority of socialism, propagate the correctness of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the leadership of the Party and the power of the unity between the Party and the people, and write more articles that discuss the Four Cardinal Principles from the ideological and theoretical levels. Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said very seriously: not regarding the Four Cardinal Principles as basic ideas to educate the people, educate students, educate all cadres and Communist Party members is a major mistake of ours.

How do we carry out the propaganda and education of the Four Cardinal Principles? Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed the following important ideas: First, we must strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, so that all levels of cadres in the Party, especially leading cadres, are familiar with the basic theories of Marxism, thereby strengthening the principled, systematic, foresighted, and creative aspects of our work. Second, we must use China's history to educate the youth, so that they understand that China has no other path but the socialist road. Third, we must carry out education on hard work and self-reliance, prevent all tendencies to look at money and worship foreign things, and lose the national pride and self-respect of socialist China. Fourth, we must educate the entire Chinese people to have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, especially our youth, the next generation and the generation after that, to have ideals, to establish the great ideal of communism, and not to be captives of capitalist decadent thoughts.

Next, we must resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization. This is also an issue that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has talked about the most in the past ten years. He believes that if bourgeois liberalization is allowed to run wild, it will be impossible to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles. Facing the challenge of bourgeois liberalization, he requires Marxists to stand up and speak out, and the Communist Party members on the ideological front, especially those who bear leadership responsibilities and have influence in this area, must stand at the forefront of the struggle. Comrade Deng Xiaoping also criticized the phenomenon of some Party organizations not effectively resisting the trend of bourgeois liberalization.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that in opposing bourgeois liberalization, leading cadres must be resolute. When the leadership is resolute, the masses can see clearly. When the leadership is resolute, it gives active elements courage, and the middle masses can stand up. When the leadership's attitude is resolute, bourgeois liberalization cannot be stirred up. Wherever bourgeois liberalization can be stirred up, it is because the leadership's attitude is not resolute and the banner is not clear.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that opposing bourgeois liberalization is a long-term educational issue, parallel to the Four Modernizations, and the entire process of the Four Modernizations exists with the issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization. The Four Modernizations, we will implement for fifty to seventy years, and within these fifty to seventy years, there will always be the issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization. This struggle will run through the entire process of achieving the Four Modernizations, not only in this century but also in the next century.

We must persistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely carry out reform and opening up

Implementing opening up to the outside world and activating the economy domestically is one of the two basic points of the Party's line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the two basic points is of great significance for persistently upholding the Four Cardinal Principles. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strengthening the country; the two are complementary and mutually promoting. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have formulated two policies: the first is to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, and the second is to build socialist Four Modernizations, determining the goals of two stages. To achieve the goals of these two stages, we need to formulate two open policies, namely opening up to the outside world and opening up domestically, which is a set of interrelated policies and measures.

Only by upholding reform and opening up can we better uphold the Four Cardinal Principles. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "Poverty is not socialism." If socialism is always poor, it will not stand, and ultimately, to convince those who do not believe in socialism, we rely on our development. If we achieve a moderately prosperous society by the end of this century, it will make them more sober, and when we build a moderately developed socialist country by the end of the next century, we will be able to further convince them, and most of them will truly realize that they were wrong. To develop productive forces, we must reform China's economic system and implement the policy of opening up to the outside world. Reform is the necessary path for China's development of productive forces.

Reform and opening up must be carried out on the basis of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: the policy of opening up to the outside world and activating the economy domestically, we will not change, and the foundation of all these policies is the Four Cardinal Principles, which we will not change or waver from. Comrade Deng Xiaoping also said: "In the reform, we must uphold the socialist direction, this is a very important issue." (Ibid., page 305) The domestic economic activation and external opening up we are talking about now are carried out under the premise of upholding socialist principles. "In the reform, we have always upheld two fundamental principles: one is that the socialist public ownership economy is the mainstay; the other is common prosperity." (Ibid., page 310) If our reform, on the one hand, upholds the socialist public ownership economy as the mainstay, and on the other hand, pays attention to not leading to polarization, then there is nothing wrong with it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping especially emphasized that reform is the self-improvement of the socialist system, not self-denial, let alone liberalization. He criticized some people who used the pretext of reform to engage in liberalization. He said that some people's so-called "reform" should be renamed liberalization. Their "reform" is centered on capitalism. The reform we talk about is different from theirs.

The Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up must be persistently upheld. Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "Is the 'one center, two basic points' summarized by the Party's Thirteenth Congress correct? Are the two basic points, that is, the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, wrong? I have been thinking about this question recently. We have not made a mistake." "The Four Cardinal Principles themselves are not wrong, if there is a mistake, it is that we have not been consistent enough in upholding the Four Cardinal Principles." In these ten years, the people's living standards have improved significantly, and it should be said that they have risen to a new level, although problems such as inflation have emerged, but the achievements of ten years of reform and opening up should be fully estimated. To say it is not enough is that reform and opening up are still not enough. Persistently upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and more boldly carrying out reform and opening up are important tasks before us.

    始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则
　　——学习邓小平同志坚持四项基本原则的论述
　　殷学润
    坚持四项基本原则即坚持社会主义道路，坚持人民民主专政，坚持共产党的领导，坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想，作为一个完整的政治命题，是邓小平同志1979年3月在党的理论工作务虚会上首次提出来的。以后他又在各个不同的场合对这一问题进行了充分的阐明。为什么要坚持四项基本原则？四项基本原则的要义是什么？怎样始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则？重新学习邓小平同志的有关论述，弄清楚这些问题，十分重要。
    四项基本原则是立国之本，
    必须毫不动摇始终一贯地坚持
    为什么要坚持四项基本原则呢？最重要的理由：四项基本原则是我们的立国之本。邓小平同志指出，“四项基本原则并不是新的东西，是我们党长期以来所一贯坚持的。”（《坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化》第11页，以下引文只注页码）。我们的党从诞生的那一天起就以马克思主义的科学世界观为指南，就把社会主义和共产主义的伟大理想写在自己的旗帜上，就把进行人民民主革命以建立人民民主专政的共和国作为自己的行动纲领，就代表觉醒了的工人阶级肩负起领导中国革命的历史使命。建国以后，中华人民共和国第一部宪法就明确肯定了中国共产党的领导、人民民主专政和走社会主义道路。四项基本原则是我国社会主义革命和建设基本经验的结晶，是我们立国和团结全国人民奋斗的根本。
    其次，坚持四项基本原则是在中国实现四个现代化的根本前提和保证。邓小平同志明确指出，我们搞的四个现代化有个名字，就是社会主义四个现代化。他多次阐明，中国的四个现代化只能通过社会主义道路来实现，搞资本主义不行。在中国搞四个现代化，要坚持和发展社会主义的公有制经济，要使全国人民共同富裕。另一方面，中国要实现四个现代化，没有一个安定团结的政治局面是不可能的。如果动摇了四项基本原则，我们的社会就将是一个动乱的社会，什么建设改革、振兴中华，都将成为空话。
    坚持四项基本原则也是由国内外的这个特定情况决定的：无论在国内还是在国外，都有人企图动摇这些原则。从国内情况来看，一方面，党内有一部分同志深受林彪、“四人帮”极左思潮的毒害，有极少数人甚至攻击党中央在粉碎“四人帮”以来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来所实行的一系列方针政策违反马列主义、毛泽东思想；另一方面，社会上有极少数人正在散布怀疑或反对四项基本原则的思潮，而党内也有个别同志不但不承认这种思潮的危险，甚至直接间接地加以某种程度的支持。虽然散布这种错误思潮的人是极少数，但不能因为他们是极少数而忽视他们的作用。事实证明，他们不但可以而且已经对我们的事业造成了很大危害。在一定情况下，公然反对社会主义制度和共产党领导的所谓“民主派”同“四人帮”的残余，流氓集团、刑事犯罪分子等社会渣滓完全可以纠合在一起，成为一股破坏势力，造成不小的动乱和损失。前一段发生在北京的动乱和反革命暴乱，再一次充分证明了这一点。从外部环境来看，一些香港的议论，台湾的议论，都反对我们的四项基本原则，主张我们把资本主义一套制度都拿过来。西方帝国主义势力也是企图使社会主义纳入资本主义轨道。
    正是基于以上的原因，邓小平同志强调指出，为了实现四个现代化，我们必须坚持四项基本原则。在这个根本立场问题上，不允许有丝毫动摇。如果动摇了这四项基本原则中的任何一项，那就动摇了整个社会主义事业，整个现代化建设事业。
            只有社会主义才能救中国，
                只有社会主义才能发展中国
    坚持四项基本原则最根本的是要坚持党的领导，坚持社会主义道路。为什么要坚持社会主义道路呢？邓小平同志回答了以下几个主要问题。
      第一，中国除了走社会主义道路以外，还有没有别的道路可走？对此，邓小平同志从一个多世纪的近代史论证了社会主义在中国的历史必然性。他说，1840年鸦片战争之后，中国陷入了半殖民地半封建的社会。从那时起，我国许多有识之士包括孙中山都在寻求中国的出路。孙中山开始就想学习西方。后来，孙中山觉得资本主义西方不行了，提出“以俄为师”，学习十月革命后的俄国，开始了国共合作，导致北伐战争的胜利。孙中山逝世以后，国民党的统治使中国继续沦为半殖民地半封建社会，后来在日本侵华期间还多了个殖民地社会，并且形成和发展了官僚资本主义，中国继续贫穷下去。这个历史告诉我们，中国走资本主义道路不行，中国除了走社会主义道路没有别的道路可走。中国离开社会主义就必然要退回到半封建半殖民地。只有社会主义才能救中国，这是中国人民从五四运动到现在的切身体验中得出的不可动摇的历史结论。
    第二，社会主义制度和资本主义制度哪个好？邓小平同志回答：当然是社会主义好。社会主义的经济是以公有制为基础的，生产是为了最大限度地满足人民的物质、文化需要，而不是为了剥削。社会主义制度使我国人民能有共同的政治经济社会理想，共同的道德标准。以上这些，资本主义社会永远不可能有。资本主义无论如何不能摆脱百万富翁的超级利润，不能摆脱剥削和掠夺。我们的党和人民浴血奋斗多年建立的社会主义制度，尽管还不完善，但是无论如何，社会主义制度总比弱肉强食、损人利己的资本主义制度好得多，我们的制度将一天天完善起来，它将吸收我们可以从世界各国吸收的进步因素，成为世界上最好的制度。这是资本主义绝对不可能做到的。社会主义革命已经使我国大大缩小了同发达资本主义国家在经济发展方面的差距。我们尽管犯过一些错误，但我们还是在三四十年间取得了旧中国几百年、几千年所没有取得过的进步。我们的经济建设曾经有过较快的发展速度。现在我们总结了经验，纠正了错误，毫无疑问将会比任何资本主义国家发展得都快，并且比较稳定而持久。
      第三，中国的发展靠什么？邓小平同志的回答：只有社会主义能够救中国，只有社会主义能够发展中国。邓小平同志认为，中国是个什么样的国家，将要发展成为什么样的国家，是决定中国发展道路的最根本的东西。他指出，要使中国实现四个现代化，至少有两个重要特点是必须看到的，一个是底子薄；一个是人口多，耕地少。在中国现在落后的状态下，怎样发展生产力，怎样改善人民生活？这就必须搞社会主义，搞资本主义不行。因为，我们要解决吃饭问题，就业问题，要解决中国的统一问题。中国十亿人口，现在还处于落后状态，如果走资本主义道路，可能在某些局部地区少数人更快地富起来，形成一个新的资产阶级，产生一批百万富翁，但顶多也不会达到人口的百分之一，而大量的人仍然摆脱不了贫穷，甚至连温饱问题都不可能解决，还会发生严重的就业问题。他提出，中国发展的最低目标是到本世纪末达到小康社会，国民生产总值人均达到800美元。按12亿人口计算，即国民生产总值达到一万亿美元。按社会主义的分配原则，可以使全国人民普遍处于小康状态。这就是我们为什么要坚持社会主义的道理。
      只有社会主义能够发展中国，同时又是由中国在世界政治经济格局中的地位所决定的。一个国家摆脱外来奴役，实现独立自主，是发展的前提。这一点对中国这样的大国尤为重要。邓小平同志认为，现代世界已不具有自由资本主义发展的条件，整个国际市场都占得满满的。如果我们不坚持社会主义，最终发展起来也不过成为一个附庸国，而且连想要发展起来也不容易。现在中国还很穷，但在世界中占有重要位置，发挥着举足轻重的影响。为什么会有这么大的影响？就是因为中国是独立自主的国家。为什么说我们是独立自主的？就是因为我们坚持社会主义道路。否则，就只能看发达资本主义国家的脸色行事，还有什么独立性可言，还有什么发展可言！
      第四，我国社会主义制度的优越性为什么没有充分发挥出来？针对这一问题，邓小平同志指出，社会主义制度并不等于建设社会主义的具体做法。社会主义制度是个好制度。我们搞社会主义虽然犯过错误，但总的来说，改变了中国的面貌。社会主义国家所以在某些情况下也犯错误甚至出现林彪、“四人帮”的破坏这种严重曲折，固然有主观的原因，根本原因还是旧社会长时期历史遗留的影响造成的。我们确实还缺乏经验，也许现在我们才认真地探索一条比较好的道路。但不管怎么样，社会主义制度优越性已经得到了证明，不过还要证明得更多更有力。我们一定要、也一定能拿今后的大量事实来证明，社会主义制度优于资本主义制度。
      中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量，
          没有党的领导就没有现代中国的一切
    坚持四项基本原则的核心是坚持党的领导。为什么要坚持中国共产党的领导？邓小平同志说，在中国这样的大国，要把10亿人口的思想和力量统一起来建设社会主义，没有一个由具有高度觉悟性、纪律性和自我牺牲精神的党员组成的能够真正代表和团结人民群众的党，没有中国共产党的统一领导，是不可设想的，那就只会四分五裂，一事无成。我们人民的团结，社会的安定，民主的发展，国家的统一，都要靠党的领导。
      为什么说中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量？因为我们这个党是以马列主义、毛泽东思想理论为指导的党，是无产阶级的、有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的、有革命纪律的先进队伍。这就决定了它必然是领导社会主义事业、领导无产阶级专政的核心力量。
      中国共产党对中国社会主义事业的领导地位，是几十年的斗争历史形成的。在中国，在五四运动以来的几十年中，除了中国共产党，根本不存在另外一个像列宁所说的联系广大劳动群众的党。因为有了党的领导，中国人民经过千难万苦的奋斗，终于建立了中华人民共和国。中国一向被称为一盘散沙，但自从我们党成为执政党，成为全国团结的核心力量，四分五裂、各霸一方的局面就结束了。因此，邓小平同志强调，不要小视我们的党。没有中国共产党，就没有社会主义的新中国。从根本上说，没有党的领导，就没有现代中国的一切。
      过去我们取得胜利靠党的领导，现在的社会主义现代化事业能不能离开党的领导？邓小平同志回答，离开了中国共产党的领导，谁来组织社会主义的经济、政治、军事和文化？谁来组织中国的四个现代化？在今天的中国，决不应该离开党的领导而歌颂群众的自发性。削弱甚至取消党的领导，事实上只能导致无政府主义，导致社会主义事业的瓦解和覆灭。他还指出，十一届三中全会以来，我们党经过拨乱反正，思想路线、政治路线、组织路线都是正确的，通过逐步探索，已经开始找到了一条有中国特色的社会主义的道路。只要我们党的领导是正确的，那就不仅能够把全党的力量，而且能够把全国人民的力量集中起来，干出轰轰烈烈的事业。
      中国能不能搞多党制？邓小平同志回答说，资本主义国家的多党制有什么好处？那种多党制是资产阶级互相倾轧的状态所决定的，它们谁也不代表广大劳动人民的利益。这种状况是他们的弱点而不是强点，这使他们每个国家的力量不可能完全集中起来，很大一部分力量互相牵制和抵消。他坚定地表示，中国决不能照搬西方的多党制。中国由共产党领导，中国的社会主义现代化建设由共产党领导，这个原则是不能动摇的；动摇了中国就要倒退到分裂和混乱，就不可能实现现代化。
    怎样看待中国共产党曾经出现的错误和失误？邓小平同志指出，总的来说，我们党的历史还是光辉的历史。我们党也犯过严重错误，但是错误总还是由我们党自己纠正的，不是别的力量来纠正的。就是粉碎“四人帮”也是由我们党代表人民的利益和要求来实现的。我们在今后的工作中，将力求做得比较正确，或者说力求少犯错误，避免大的曲折，大的错误，有了错误尽快纠正。我们党的中央，一定能够做到这一步，我们是充满信心的。中国的现代化建设需要我们的党，中国在国际斗争和争取人类进步事业中的重要地位，需要我们党。我们一定要坚持党的领导，改善党的领导，加强党的纪律和战斗力，使我们党能够胜任对于整个国家和各族人民的巨大领导责任。
    加强四项基本原则的宣传、教育，
    旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化
    怎样坚持四项基本原则？邓小平同志多次指出，首先要加强四项基本原则的宣传、教育，大力宣传社会主义的优越性，宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确性，宣传党的领导、党和人民群众团结一致的威力，要多写些从思想上、理论上论述坚持四项基本原则的文章。最近，邓小平同志非常严肃地说：没有把四个坚持作为基本思想来教育人民，教育学生，教育全体干部和共产党员，这是我们很大的失误。
    怎样进行四项基本原则的宣传教育呢？邓小平同志提出了以下一些重要思想：一是要加强马列主义理论的学习，使全党的各级干部，特别是领导干部，熟悉马克思主义的基本理论，从而加强我们工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性。二是要用中国的历史教育青年，使他们懂得，中国除了走社会主义道路没有别的道路可走。三是要进行艰苦奋斗、独立自主的教育，防止一切向“钱”看和崇洋媚外，丧失社会主义中国的民族自豪感和民族自尊心。四是教育全国人民做到有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律，尤其我们的青年，下一代下两代，要有理想，树立共产主义的远大理想，不让他们作资本主义腐朽思想的俘虏。
    其次，必须旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。这也是邓小平同志近十年来讲得最多的一个问题。他认为，放任资产阶级自由化，就不可能坚持四项基本原则。面对资产阶级自由化的挑战，他要求马克思主义者站出来讲话，思想战线的共产党员，特别是这方面担负领导责任的有影响的共产党员，必须站在斗争的前列。邓小平同志还批评了我们一些党组织对资产阶级自由化倾向抵制不得力的现象。
    邓小平同志强调，反对资产阶级自由化，领导干部首先要旗帜鲜明。领导旗帜鲜明，群众才能擦亮眼睛。领导旗帜鲜明了，给积极分子鼓了气，中间群众才能站过来。领导态度坚决了，资产阶级自由化就闹不起来了。凡是资产阶级自由化闹得起来的地方，都是因为那里的领导态度不坚决，旗帜不鲜明。
    邓小平同志指出，反对资产阶级自由化是一个长期教育的问题，同四个现代化将是平行的，整个四个现代化的过程都存在一个反对资产阶级自由化问题。四个现代化，我们要搞五十至七十年，在这五十至七十年内都存在一个反对资产阶级自由化的问题。这个斗争贯穿在实现四化的整个过程中，不仅本世纪内要进行，下个世纪还要继续进行。
      既要始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，
          又要坚定不移地搞好改革开放
    实行对外开放，对内搞活经济是十一届三中全会以来党的路线的两个基本点之一。正确理解和处理两个基本点的关系，对于始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，具有重要意义。四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，二者是相辅相成，互相促进的。邓小平同志指出，党的十一届三中全会以来我们制定的方针，第一条是坚持四项基本原则，第二条是搞社会主义四个现代化建设，确定了两个阶段的目标。要实现这两个阶段的目标，需要制定两个开放的政策，即对外开放和对内开放，这是一整套相互关联的方针政策。
      只有坚持改革开放，才能更好地坚持四项基本原则。邓小平同志指出，“贫穷不是社会主义”。社会主义如果老是穷的，它就站不住脚，最终说服不相信社会主义的人要靠我们的发展。如果我们本世纪内达到了小康水平，那就可以使他们清醒一点，到下世纪我们建成中等发达水平的社会主义国家时，就会大进一步地说服他们，他们中的大多数人才会真正认识到自己错了。为了发展生产力，就必须对我国的经济体制进行改革，实行对外开放的政策。改革是中国发展生产力的必由之路。
      改革开放必须在坚持四项基本原则的基础上进行。邓小平同志指出：对外开放、对内搞活经济政策，我们是不会改变的，而所有这些政策的基础，就是四项基本原则，对此我们更是不会改变，不会动摇的。邓小平同志还说：“在改革中坚持社会主义方向，这是一个很重要的问题”。　（同上，第305页）我们现在讲的对内搞活经济，对外开放是在坚持社会主义原则下开展的。“在改革中，我们始终坚持两条根本原则：一是社会主义公有制经济占主体；一是共同富裕。”（同上，第310页）如果我们的改革一方面坚持社会主义公有制为主体，另一方面又注意不导致两极分化，这就没有什么坏处。邓小平同志特别强调改革是社会主义制度的自我完善，而不是自我否定，更不是自由化。他批评了某些人借口改革搞自由化。他说，某些人所谓的“改革”，应该换个名字叫自由化。他们“改革”的中心是资本主义化。我们讲的改革与他们不同。
      四项基本原则和改革开放都要始终不懈地坚持下去。最近，邓小平同志说，“党的十三大概括的‘一个中心，两个基本点’对不对？两个基本点，即四个坚持和改革开放，是不是错了？我最近总在想这个问题。我们没有错。”“四个坚持本身没有错，如果说有错的话，就是坚持四项基本原则还不够一贯。”这十年人民生活水平有较大提高，应该说上了一个台阶，尽管出现了通货膨胀等问题，但十年改革开放的成绩要充分估计够。要说不够，就是改革开放得还不够。始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，更大胆地改革开放，是摆在我们面前的重要任务。
