The problem of employees defaulting on public funds cannot be ignored. A survey in Jilin shows that it has increased the burden on enterprises. Statistics from Anlong show that it has embezzled state funds.

A recent survey by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Jilin Provincial Branch, on over 14,000 enterprises found that 243,000 employees have defaulted on public funds, accounting for 11.2% of the total number of employees. By the end of April this year, the amount of defaulted funds reached over 200 million yuan.

Currently, the problem of employees defaulting on public funds has the following aspects:

The amount of defaulted funds is large. For example, a procurement officer in the Tonghua City Grain Depot borrowed travel expenses repeatedly under the pretext of travel, accumulating a debt of 173,000 yuan over several years.

The scope of defaulted funds is wide. In some units, all employees have defaulted on public funds. For instance, all 14 employees of the Hunchun City Overseas Chinese Store have defaulted on public funds, with a total amount of over 100,000 yuan.

The duration of defaulted funds is long. A considerable amount of defaulted funds has been outstanding for more than 5 years, with some debts lasting as long as 10 years.

The reasons for the increase in employees defaulting on public funds include: chaotic financial management, incomplete financial systems, weak supervision measures, lack of adherence to regulations, and the absence of constraints from rules and regulations. Leaders setting an example by defaulting on funds, leading to a culture of borrowing among the masses; lax discipline, and ineffective measures for recovering debts. The large-scale defaulting on funds by employees has reduced the available funds for enterprises, increasing the burden on enterprises. These enterprises have to pay 27.6 million yuan in interest annually.

The dark tide of individuals defaulting on public funds is embezzling a large amount of state funds. According to statistics from 36 units in Anlong County, Guizhou, 257 individuals have defaulted on public funds, accounting for 14% of the total number of employees, with a total defaulted amount of 179,000 yuan and an average default of 696.8 yuan per person. The reasons include: some individuals using their positions to occupy public funds from their own units or related units for personal use, such as buying furniture, cars, renovating houses, or doing business; not settling accounts after borrowing public funds for overseas trips or business trips; not reporting and settling accounts for purchased items in a timely manner; long-term borrowing due to financial difficulties, etc. I believe that at present, it is necessary to focus on clearing and recovering defaulted public funds as an important part of clean governance and anti-corruption efforts.

### 职工拖欠公款问题不可忽视

    职工拖欠公款问题不可忽视
    吉林调查表明——加大了企业负担
    安龙统计结果——侵吞了国家资金
    中国工商银行吉林省分行张明圣　张毅明来信：最近，吉林省工商银行对1.4万多家企业的职工欠款情况作了调查，发现拖欠公款的人数达24.3万人，占职工总数的11.2％；到今年4月末，欠款金额达2亿多元。
    当前，职工欠款有以下几个问题：
    欠款金额大。如通化市粮库一名采购员以借旅差费为名，屡借不还，几年中就累计借款17.3万元；
    欠款范围广。有的单位全体职工都有欠款，如浑江市华侨商店共有14名职工，全部欠公款，总额达10万多元；
    欠款时间长。有相当数额的欠款在5年以上，有的欠款长达10年之久；
    欠款名目多。职工借款名目多达10多种，其中主要是公出借款、医疗费借款、职工建房、购房借款等等。
    形成职工欠款大量增加的原因有：财务管理混乱、财务制度不健全；监督措施不力，有了制度不遵守，失去了规章制度的约束性；领导带头欠款，引起群众攀比借款；法纪松弛，清欠款缺乏有效手段。职工大量欠款，使企业减少了可用资金，加大了企业负担。这些企业每年要支付2760万元的利息。
    中国工商银行贵州省黔西南布依族苗族自治州中心支行汪仁孝来信：私人拖欠公款这股暗流正侵吞着国家大量的资金。据贵州安龙县36个单位统计，私人拖欠公款的有257人，占职工总数的14％，欠款总额17.9万元，人均欠款696.8元。原因是，有人利用职权占用本单位或关系单位的公款，为自己添置家具、买汽车、修房子、做生意；出国考察或出差借用公款回来后不结账；采购物品不及时报账结清；生活困难，长期借支等。我认为，当前，应把清理收回拖欠公款作为廉政建设，反对腐败的一项重要内容来抓。
