Jieshi Mountain, located in the "Golden Coast" tourist area of Changli County, Hebei Province, is majestic and towering, reaching high into the clouds. Surrounded by nearly a hundred peaks of varying sizes, it is the highest peak along the Bohai Sea coast. Here, the mountains are lush and green, and the streams babble gently. High peaks hide ancient temples, and deep valleys echo with the sound of flowing water. Throughout history, emperors such as Qin Shi Huang, Han Wudi, Wei Wu, Tang Taizong, Emperor Wencheng of the Northern Wei, Emperor Wenxuan of the Northern Qi, and even the Qin Er Shi, along with countless poets, scholars, heroes, and nobles, have come to Jieshi Mountain to gaze at the sea, appreciate the scenery, compose poetry, carve inscriptions, record achievements, or feast and enjoy themselves. They have left behind countless traces, making Jieshi Mountain famous.

In recent years, with the opening up to the outside world and the increase in its fame, batches of tourists have come here to imagine "Jieshi Mountain and the Qin Emperor" and "viewing the sea and remembering Cao Cao." They stand by the wind, pay tribute, and express their feelings.

The entire Jieshi Mountain is divided into the Eastern Five Peaks and the Western Five Peaks. Following the Jieshi Mountain path up thousands of stone steps, one encounters strange peaks soaring into the sky, peculiar rocks standing tall, winding paths, and the sounds of birds and flowers, all rich with the charm of the wilderness. One can appreciate the ten major scenic spots of the mountain, each with its own unique features: "Spring Dawn by the Water Rock," "Autumn Wind in the Stone Cave," "Emerald Peak in the East," "Blue Ridge in the West," "Phoenix Soaring over Auspicious Peaks," and "Jieshi Sea View." Among them, "Jieshi Sea View," also known as the Immortal Platform, is an ancient and modern scenic spot for viewing the sea. Tourists who climb to the top of the Immortal Platform can see all the scenery within a radius of a hundred miles.

The beauty of Jieshi Mountain is countless. Come and visit, friends! A corner of the urban area of Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province.
