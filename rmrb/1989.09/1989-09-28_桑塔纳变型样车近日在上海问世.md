The first Santana sedan variant prototype was unveiled in Shanghai yesterday.

Developing a new generation of Santana sedan variants based on the principles of introduction, digestion, and absorption, followed by independent innovation, is a significant decision made by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Shanghai Automobile and Tractor Research Institute targeted the "multi-passenger compact van" that was developed in the mid-1980s abroad and is expected to become the mainstream product in the car market in the 1990s. Within half a year, they successfully produced the prototype. This variant can seat seven people and combines the advantages of both sedans and vans.

    桑塔纳变型样车近日在上海问世
    本报上海九月二十七日电  记者萧关根报道：第一辆桑塔纳轿车变型车样车昨天在上海问世。
    在引进、消化、吸收的基础上自力更生开发新一代桑塔纳轿车变型车，是上海市政府的一项重要决策。上海汽车拖拉机研究所瞄准国外八十年代中开发、九十年代将成为轿车市场主流产品的“多乘座紧凑型厢式客车”，半年内就造出了样车。这辆变型车，可乘坐七人，兼具轿车和厢式车的优点。
