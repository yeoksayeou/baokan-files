In recent times, a trend of easing tensions has emerged across the African continent. Several countries that have been plagued by long-standing internal conflicts are now showing signs of seeking peaceful resolutions to their internal strife.

	Angola

Since gaining independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, Angola has been embroiled in a continuous civil war due to internal conflicts among the various anti-Portuguese liberation movements, the intervention of superpowers, and sabotage by South Africa.

Under the mediation of the United States and the cooperation of the Soviet Union, after 8 months of more than 10 rounds of negotiations, Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Peace Agreement on December 12, 1988. According to the agreement, South African troops withdrew from Angola, and Cuban troops began and will eventually completely withdraw from Angola.

On June 22, 18 African heads of state gathered in the hometown of Zaire President Mobutu to hold a summit aimed at achieving peace in Angola. At the meeting, Angolan President Dos Santos and the leader of the rebel forces, Savimbi, shook hands for the first time and reached an agreement to cease hostilities.

The civil war in Angola has lasted for 14 years, causing immense damage. Angola is rich in natural resources, yet now it is a land of misery, with factories closed, fields abandoned, goods scarce, and no possibility of normal economic development. The war has claimed the lives of 50,000 people, injured 50,000 more, displaced 1.5 million, and forced another 100,000 to flee the country. Despite support from external forces, neither side has been able to defeat the other.

Now, both sides have reached a ceasefire agreement. Although both sides accuse each other of violating the agreement and there are still disagreements over the formation of the future government, they are both working to maintain the ceasefire. All parties involved are also creating further conditions for reconciliation.

	Mozambique

Mozambique shares similarities with Angola. Since gaining independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, it has also been plagued by internal and external troubles. Frequent invasions and sabotage by South Africa, as well as the harassment and attacks by the anti-government resistance movement (RENAMO) supported by South Africa, have kept Mozambique in a state of unrest.

Mozambican President Chissano attended the Zaire summit. The achievement of peace in Angola has boosted his confidence in realizing domestic peace in Mozambique. He sees the Angolan model of reconciliation as a template for his own country. He called on RENAMO to abandon war and follow the path of reconciliation taken by UNITA, to accept the government's peace plan, and to accept the status quo, adding meaningfully that accepting the status quo does not mean the status quo cannot change. Currently, both the Mozambican government and RENAMO have agreed to request Kenyan President Moi to mediate their conflict. To this end, Moi visited Mozambique on July 21. Mozambique's efforts at reconciliation have received support from the international community. The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Cohen said that the United States will try to end all forms of aid to RENAMO, and the United States has been continuously urging South Africa to stop aiding Mozambique's anti-government forces. Cohen also called on RENAMO to negotiate with the Mozambican government, praising the Mozambican government's peace plan as "broad and reasonable."

In recent years, South Africa has been in contact with several African countries, attempting to improve relations and change its isolated status. Following the visits of the South African Foreign Minister to Mozambique in February and March, the new leader of the ruling party and acting President de Klerk visited Mozambique on July 19 to discuss the Mozambican civil war with President Chissano.

	Namibia

According to the New York Agreement reached at the end of last year, Namibia began its path to independence on April 1. Although armed clashes in northern Namibia in early April temporarily stalled this process, overall it has been relatively smooth. This trend of reconciliation has promoted internal reconciliation in Angola and Mozambique. The reconciliation trends in these two countries are actually a chain reaction and a necessary result of peace in southwestern Africa. This positive phenomenon may also affect the overall situation in southern Africa and may promote reconciliation within South Africa. On the very day Angola implemented the ceasefire, the African National Congress issued a statement saying that its organization was discussing the possibility of negotiating with the South African authorities. However, the South African authorities will still act in their own interests to create obstacles in the Namibian elections and other issues. It will not be smooth sailing.

	Ethiopia

Ethiopia is another African country plagued by years of civil war. According to United Nations resolutions, the northern region of Eritrea formed a federation with Ethiopia in 1952. In 1962, then-Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie declared Eritrea to be a region of Ethiopia. For 28 years, the Eritreans have been fighting the Ethiopian government forces for the independence of the region. The Eritrean war is the longest war in African history. More than 50% of Ethiopia's expenditures are used for this war.

This year, the Ethiopian government proposed a new peace initiative, agreeing for the first time to unconditional negotiations with the rebel forces. It has sent many delegations abroad to seek international support for its peace efforts, especially from Arab countries, because many Arab countries support the rebel forces.

Ethiopia's Foreign Minister said on July 10 that the government's peace proposal has received a positive response from the rebel forces, and both sides are about to hold talks to end the 28-year-old civil war in the northern region. In fact, the government has had several secret contacts with the Eritrean rebel forces. The rebel forces in the northern Tigray region recently called on the government to negotiate again.

The rebel forces demand the independence of Eritrea, while Ethiopian President Mengistu still insists that national unity is not negotiable. This will be the focus of future negotiations.

	Sudan

On June 30, a military coup occurred in Sudan. The new government, upon taking power, declared a one-month unilateral ceasefire and granted amnesty to the rebel forces, the Sudan People's Liberation Army. On July 11, the new Sudanese government sent representatives to Addis Ababa to request Ethiopian mediation in Sudan's internal conflicts. The new Sudanese leader announced that achieving domestic peace is his top priority.

In fact, the process of reconciliation in Sudan began before the coup. This year, the former Sudanese government and the rebel forces held their first formal talks, during which the former Sudanese government accepted the peace agreement reached in November between the second-largest party in the government and the rebel forces. The agreement included suspending the enforcement of Islamic law, abolishing the state of emergency, and achieving a ceasefire between the government and rebel forces.

The Sudanese military demands an end to the six-year civil war, and the military government, after taking power, naturally accelerates the pace of reconciliation. The leader of the Sudanese rebel forces, Garang, has repeatedly stated that he does not dislike the current military government.

In the past, both Sudan and Ethiopia supported each other's rebel forces, but now they have changed their stance. Currently, Ethiopia is actively mediating Sudan's internal conflicts, arranging for the two sides to meet in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.

    非洲大陆致力于解决内部纷争
    王能标
    最近一个时期以来，非洲大陆出现了缓和趋势。一些长期内战不休的国家出现了交战双方积极谋求和平解决内乱的势头。
            安哥拉
    安哥拉自1975年摆脱葡萄牙殖民统治取得独立以来，由于原先各个反葡民族解放运动组织之间的矛盾、超级大国的插手和南非的破坏，一直内战不休。
    在美国的斡旋和苏联的配合下，去年经过长达8个月的10多轮谈判，安哥拉、古巴和南非终于在12月签署了关于古巴从安哥拉撤军和实现纳米比亚独立的纽约和平协定。根据协定，南非军队撤出了安哥拉，古巴军队也开始并将最终全部撤离安哥拉。
    6月22日，18个非洲国家领导人在扎伊尔总统蒙博托的家乡举行首脑会议，帮助实现安哥拉和平。会上，安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯和反政府武装领导人萨文比第一次互相握手并达成了双方停火的协议。
    安哥拉内战连绵14年，内乱外患造成了巨大损失。安哥拉物产十分丰富，而现在却是民不聊生，满目疮痍，工厂倒闭，农田荒芜，商品奇缺，根本谈不上进行正常的经济建设。战祸使5万人丧生，5万人致残，150万人流离失所，另有10万人逃离本土。交战双方尽管都有外部势力的支持，但是谁也没有打败谁。
    现在，双方达成了停火协议。尽管双方都指责对方有违反协议的行动，在组成未来政府的方式上还有分歧，但都在努力维持停火，有关各方也都在为和解进一步创造条件。
          莫桑比克
    莫桑比克和安哥拉有类似之处，自1975年摆脱葡萄牙殖民统治以来，也是处于内忧外患中。南非的频繁入侵、破坏，以及它支持的反政府武装全国抵抗运动（抵运）的骚扰袭击，使莫桑比克长期得不安宁。
    莫桑比克总统希萨诺参加了扎伊尔首脑会议，安哥拉和平协议的达成使他增添了实现莫桑比克国内和平的信心。他把安哥拉这一和解模式作为他的国家的和解样板。他呼吁“抵运”放弃战争，像“安盟”那样走和解道路，接受政府的和平计划，接受现状，并意味深长地指出，他说的接受现状并不意味着现状不能改变。目前，莫桑比克政府与“抵运”双方都同意请肯尼亚总统莫伊调解他们的冲突，为此莫伊已于7月21日访问了莫桑比克。莫桑比克的和解努力得到国际社会的帮助。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿科恩说，美国将设法结束外国对“抵运”的各种形式的援助，美国已在不断地敦促南非不再援助莫桑比克的反政府武装。科恩还呼吁“抵运”同莫政府和谈，称赞莫政府的和平计划是“广泛和合理的”。
    近年来，南非一直在同一些非洲国家接触，试图改善同非洲国家的关系，改变它的孤立处境。继今年二三月南非外长两次访莫以后，南非执政党新领袖、代总统德克勒克7月19日访问了莫桑比克同莫总统就莫内战问题举行会谈。
        纳米比亚
    根据去年底达成的纽约协议，纳米比亚4月1日开始走上独立进程。尽管4月初在纳米比亚北部发生的武装冲突使这一进程一度搁浅，但总的来说还比较顺利。这一和解势头推动了安哥拉和莫桑比克的内部和解。而这两个国家的和解趋势实际上是西南部非洲和平的连锁反应和必然结果。这一可喜现象还有可能对整个南部非洲局势产生影响，有可能促进南非国内的和解。就在安哥拉实行停火的当天，非洲人国民大会发表声明说，它的组织正在讨论同南非当局和谈的可能性。不过，南非当局还会从维护本身利益出发，在纳大选和其它问题上制造障碍。不可能一切顺利。
        埃塞俄比亚
    埃塞俄比亚也是一个连年内战不休的非洲国家。根据联合国有关决议，埃塞俄比亚北部地区厄立特里亚1952年和埃塞结成联邦。1962年，当时的埃塞俄比亚皇帝塞拉西宣布厄立特里亚为埃塞俄比亚的一个地区。28年来厄立特里亚人一直为该地区的独立同埃塞政府军作战。厄立特里亚战争是非洲历史上最长的一场战争。埃塞俄比亚政府50％以上的开支用于这场战争。
    今年5月埃塞俄比亚政府提出了一个新的和平建议，第一次同意同反政府武装举行无条件谈判。它派出许多代表团到国外争取国际社会对它的和平努力的支持，特别是阿拉伯国家的支持，因为许多阿拉伯国家是支持反政府武装的。
    埃塞俄比亚外交部长7月10日说，政府的和谈建议已得到反政府武装的积极响应，双方即将举行和谈，以结束北部地区长达28年的内战。实际上，政府已同厄立特里亚反政府武装有过几次秘密接触。北部提格雷地区的反政府武装最近也再次呼吁政府同它谈判。
    反政府武装要求厄立特里亚独立，而埃塞俄比亚总统门格斯图最近还坚持说，国家的统一不容谈判。这将是今后谈判的焦点。
            苏丹
    今年6月30日苏丹发生军事政变。新政府一上台就宣布了一个月的单方面停火，并对反政府武装苏丹人民解放军实行大赦。7月11日，苏丹新政府派代表到亚的斯亚贝巴请埃塞俄比亚调解苏丹内部冲突。苏丹新领导人宣布，实现国内和平是他的首要任务。
    实际上，苏丹的和解进程在政变前就开始了。今年苏丹前政府和反政府力量举行了首次正式和谈，会谈中苏丹前政府接受了去年11月政府中的第二大党同反政府武装达成的和平协定。协定内容包括中止执行伊斯兰法，取消紧急状态法和实现国内政府军和反政府军之间停火。
    苏丹军界要求结束6年的内战，军人执政之后，和解的步伐自然要加快。苏丹反政府武装领导人加朗多次表示，他不讨厌现在的军政府。
    过去苏丹和埃塞俄比亚都支持对方的反政府武装，现在都转变了立场。目前，埃塞俄比亚正积极调解苏丹的内部冲突，安排两派在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴进行接触。
