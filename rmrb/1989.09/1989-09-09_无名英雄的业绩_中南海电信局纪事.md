The Zhongnanhai Telecommunications Bureau was established on March 23, 1949, in the western suburbs of Beijing at Xishan, based on the original Central Communications Squad of Yan'an. It moved with the Central Government to Zhongnanhai in June of the same year. Over the decades, they have upheld the Yan'an spirit, ensuring smooth communication for the Central Government, and have achieved remarkable feats.

The switchboard operators at Zhongnanhai have always maintained the tradition of "say a name and the call is connected." Each operator can memorize over a thousand phone numbers. They know who the secretaries and guards of the leaders are, who they frequently contact, where they often go, and even the exact location of the leaders' phones. Therefore, when Central leaders make a call, they only need to say a name, and the call is immediately connected. Many leaders and officials affectionately refer to them as "telephone secretaries."

Premier Zhou Enlai was always busy, often from dawn to midnight, visiting ten or more places in a day. Sometimes, he would attend a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in the morning and then be at Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai in the evening to welcome foreign guests. Sometimes, he would still be in his office making calls at dawn and then be in a missile base in the afternoon for an inspection. These schedules were often kept secret. However, whenever there was an urgent matter, the Zhongnanhai switchboard operators would go to great lengths to connect the call to Premier Zhou. Once, Premier Zhou had just left his office when Chairman Liu Shaoqi called, asking the Premier to attend an urgent meeting. After inquiring, the operator learned that the Premier was on his way to a certain place in the western suburbs, but no one knew exactly where he was. In this situation, the operator, based on an analysis of the Premier's departure time and possible route, directly connected the call to the traffic control tower at the entrance of the Beijing Zoo. A few minutes later, when the Premier's car reached the intersection, the traffic light suddenly turned red. A police officer in a white uniform saluted the Premier and handed him the call.

Once, an official needed to find Vice Premier Tian Jiyun. Vice Premier Tian's office and residence were both unanswered, and even the State Council's duty room did not know where he was. Finally, after careful consideration, the operator managed to find Vice Premier Tian at the Agricultural and Sideline Products Exhibition. After the official finished the call with Vice Premier Tian, he exclaimed, "The Zhongnanhai switchboard operators are truly amazing!"

In May and June of this year, our republic underwent a trial by blood and fire. The Zhongnanhai Telecommunications Bureau also faced a severe test and made significant contributions.

    无名英雄的业绩
    ——中南海电信局纪事
    中南海电信局是在原延安中央机关通信排的基础上，于1949年3月23日在北京西郊香山成立、同年6月随中央迁至中南海的。几十年来，他们坚持延安作风，为确保中央通信的畅通，做出了令人钦佩的业绩。
    中南海局的话务员始终保持着“说个姓名就能接通电话”的好传统。每一个话务员都能熟背1000多个电话号码，首长的秘书是谁、警卫是谁、常和谁联系、常到哪里去，甚至连首长的话机放在什么位置，她们都了如指掌。所以，中央首长打电话，只要说个姓名，马上就可以找到。许多首长和机关同志都亲切地称她们是“电话秘书”。
    周恩来总理日理万机，常常从黎明到深夜一天要走十几个地方。有时上午在人民大会堂开会，晚上就可能在上海的虹桥机场迎送外宾；有时候黎明还在办公室里打电话，下午就可能深入导弹基地检查工作，而这些日程安排常常是保密的。但是，只要是有重大事情找总理，中南海的话务员就能千方百计地把电话接到周总理身边。一次，总理刚刚离开办公室，刘少奇主席的电话打来了，要请总理参加一个紧急会议。经过询问，话务员了解到，总理正乘汽车去西郊某地，但是，总理现在在哪里谁也说不清。在这种情况下，话务员根据分析总理出车时间、可能走的路线，把电话直接挂到了动物园门前的交通岗楼里。几分钟后，当总理的汽车来到路口的时候，交通信号灯突然变成红色，一位身穿白色制服的警察，向总理行了一个礼后把电话通知告诉了他。
    一次，一位负责同志要找田纪云副总理，田副总理的办公室、宿舍都没有人接，问了国务院值班室都不知道到哪里去了。最后，话务员经过周密的思考，千方百计，终于在农副产品展销会上找到了田副总理。当这位负责同志与田副总理通完话后，高兴地说，“中南海的话务员真是了不起！”
    今年5、6月份，我们的共和国经历了一次血与火的考验，中南海电信局也经历了一场严峻的考验，作出了很大的贡献。
