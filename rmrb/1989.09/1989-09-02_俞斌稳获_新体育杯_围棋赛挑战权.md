The six top players participating in the 11th "New Sports Cup" Go Tournament held their fifth round of matches today at the Dongguan Hotel in Jilin City. Yu Bin, an 8th dan player, defeated Liu Xiaoguang, a 9th dan player, in a middle-game victory. Ma Xiaochun, a 9th dan player, won against Wang Fenghong, a 7th dan player, by a narrow margin of 1/4 point. Chen Linxin, an 8th dan player, won against Cao Dayuan, a 9th dan player, in a middle-game victory.

Since the champion of the 9th "New Sports Cup" Go Tournament, Yu Bin, an 8th dan player, had already secured four consecutive wins in the first four rounds of this tournament, his match against Liu Xiaoguang, a 9th dan player, was crucial for securing his challenge right. During the match, Yu Bin's moves were meticulous and precise. Despite being in an unfavorable position, he took advantage of a mistake made by Liu Xiaoguang to turn the situation around. The match ended after 244 moves with Yu Bin winning in the middle game, making his record five wins out of five matches. Since Yu Bin was the runner-up in the previous tournament, according to the competition rules, even if he loses the next two matches, he will still secure the challenge right. He will now compete against Nie Weiping, the champion of the previous tournament, for the championship of this tournament.

    俞斌稳获“新体育杯”围棋赛挑战权
    据新华社长春9月2日电　（通讯员秦占国）参加第十一届“新体育杯”围棋赛的6名国手今天在吉林市东关宾馆进行了第五轮比赛。俞斌八段执白中盘战胜刘小光九段，马晓春九段以1／4子的微弱优势胜了汪凤虹七段，陈临新八段中盘胜曹大元九段。
    由于第九届“新体育杯”围棋赛冠军俞斌八段在本届杯赛前四轮比赛中已获得四连胜，因此他今天对刘小光九段的对局对他能否获得挑战权至为关键。比赛中，俞斌八段行棋缜密、算度精确，在形势不利的情况下，利用刘小光九段一步错招扭转了形势，双方下至244手时，俞斌中盘取胜，至此他已五战五胜。由于俞斌是上届杯赛的亚军，按照比赛规则，既使他下两轮比赛全输也已稳获挑战权，他将与上届杯赛冠军聂卫平争夺本届杯赛的冠军。
