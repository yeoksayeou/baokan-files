In the 40 years of socialist construction, Guangxi has identified more than 40 types of heavy non-ferrous metals, light non-ferrous metals, precious metals, and rare metals. Among all the reserves, tin, phosphate-rare earth, indium, and hafnium rank first in the country, while antimony and scandium rank second, silver, monazite, and cadmium rank third, bauxite, zircon, and germanium rank fourth, and tungsten ranks fifth in the country.

The development of non-ferrous metals in Guangxi began in the Han Dynasty, but under the long-term feudal system, due to backward science and technology, the development and utilization of these underground treasures were extremely limited. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, Guangxi's non-ferrous metal industry has developed rapidly. The central and local governments have invested more than 10 billion yuan to develop Guangxi's non-ferrous metal industry, transforming it from the original 4 enterprises to more than 90 enterprises today (including 6 directly administered enterprises). In particular, the Daxin Mining Bureau has developed into China's second tin capital, with tin smelting capacity ranking first in the country. A large aluminum base is being built. Mining, smelting, and non-ferrous processing industries, as well as non-ferrous chemical industries, have initially formed a system. Scientific research, design, and production construction institutions have been basically established and improved. Over the past 40 years, the total industrial output value of non-ferrous metals has increased by 26.23 times, and the output of 10 commonly used non-ferrous metal smelting products has increased by 49.8 times. The content of 6 mineral products, including tin, lead, zinc, copper, antimony, and tungsten, has increased by 55.52 times. Among them, the output of scandium oxide ranks first in the country, the output of antimony and tin ranks second, and the output of titanium concentrate accounts for 44% of the country. The total output of 5 local non-ferrous metal mineral products ranks third in the country. Product quality has improved significantly, with refined tin winning the national gold medal and enjoying the status of a quality-assured product, and lead concentrate winning the national silver medal. The potential of Guangxi's non-ferrous metal resources, to some extent, demonstrates the immeasurable prospects for Guangxi's economic construction.

　　地下宝藏在闪光
    在社会主义建设的40年中，广西已探明的重有色金属、轻有色金属、贵金属和稀有金属矿种40多种。在所有储量中锡、磷钇矿、铟、铪等居全国第一位，锑、钪占全国第二，银、独居石、镉列全国第三，铝土矿、锆、锗排第四，钨排全国第五位。
    广西有色金属开发自汉代就已开始，但在漫长的封建制度之下，由于科学技术落后，这些地下宝藏的开发利用极其有限。解放以后，在中国共产党的领导和社会主义条件下，广西有色金属工业得到较快的发展。中央和地方先后投资10多亿元发展广西有色金属工业，使广西有色金属企业从原来的4家发展到现在的90多家（其中中直企业6家），特别是大厂矿务局，已经发展成为我国第二锡都。锡冶炼能力居全国第一位。大型铝业基地正在筹建。采选、冶炼和有色加工业以及有色化工工业也初步形成体系。科研、设计和生产建设机构基本建立和健全。40年来，有色金属工业总产值增加26.23倍，常用10种有色金属冶炼产品增长49.8倍，锡、铅、锌、铜、锑、钨6种矿产品含量增长55.52倍，其中氧化钪的产量居全国之首，锑、锡产量居全国第二，钛精矿产量为全国的44％。地方有色5种矿产品产量总和排全国第三位。产品质量有较大的提高，精锡获全国金牌和免检产品待遇，铅精矿获国家银牌奖。广西有色金属资源的潜力，从一个方面展示着广西经济建设的前景是不可估量的。
