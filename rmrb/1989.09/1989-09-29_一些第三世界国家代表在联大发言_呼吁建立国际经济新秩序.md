Representatives from some Third World countries speaking at the 44th UN General Assembly today discussed their views on global economic development and Third World debt issues, and presented their suggestions.

Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca stated in his speech that there is a vast economic gap between developed and developing countries. As long as this situation persists, global peace and stability will remain elusive.

He noted that in recent years, a total of $179 billion has flowed from heavily indebted Latin American countries to developed countries, accounting for 4% of their annual GDP. This, he said, is a "continuous plunder that hinders development" and a "new form of economic colonialism."

He called on the United Nations to facilitate political dialogue between debtor and creditor nations to establish a new international economic order.

Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus again proposed the establishment of an international advisory committee on debt and development. He said that in some debt reduction negotiations, debtor nations have little say, and many rules and conditions are controlled by creditor nations. Therefore, establishing such an international advisory committee is both necessary and feasible.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud proposed a comprehensive plan involving reasonable investment in the Third World, debt reduction, and expansion of export markets. He urged for "unified and urgent action" to address the imbalanced global economy.

    一些第三世界国家代表在联大发言
    呼吁建立国际经济新秩序
    新华社联合国9月27日电  出席第44届联大的一些第三世界国家的代表今天在会上发言，就世界经济发展和第三世界债务等问题阐述了各自的观点，并提出了它们的建议。
    古巴外长伊西多罗·马尔米耶卡在发言中说，发达国家和不发达国家的经济有着巨大的鸿沟，只要这种状况存在下去，世界的和平和稳定将是一纸空文。
    他说，近年来，从负债累累的拉丁美洲国家流入发达国家的资金已达1790亿美元，占其年生产总值的4％，这是“一种阻止发展的持续掠夺”和“一种新式经济殖民主义”。
    他呼吁联合国促成负债国和债权国之间的政治对话，以建立新的国际经济秩序。
    菲律宾外长劳尔·曼格拉普斯在会上再次要求成立债务和发展方面的国际顾问委员会。他说，在一些关于减少债务的谈判中，负债国并没有太多的发言权，一些规章条件主要控制在债权国的手中，因此，成立这样一个国际顾问委员会不仅必要，而且可行。
    孟加拉国外长阿尼斯·马哈茂德提出了一项涉及第三世界的合理投资、减少债务、扩大出口市场等多方面的计划，要求采取“一致而紧急的行动”改善不平衡的世界经济。
