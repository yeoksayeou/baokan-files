The Nanjing Regional Economic Coordination Conference includes Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, and Hefei, Wuhu, Ma'anshan, Tongling, Anqing, Huangshan, Huainan, Chuzhou, Liu'an, Xuancheng, Chaohu, and Chizhou in Anhui, as well as Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Jingdezhen in Jiangxi. These 18 cities are connected by roads, share similar customs, have comparable economic types, and have had extensive economic and cultural exchanges historically.

Since the founding of the nation, due to the influence of the old system of segmented administrative divisions and urban-rural separation, many of these connections have been weakened or even severed. In 1986, the 18 cities established the Coordination Conference, shifting the region's fragmented advantages towards unity and providing enterprises with a much broader stage for operations.

The Coordination Conference established a clear operational guideline: "The government builds the stage, departments promote, and enterprises perform." The foundation of this regional, networked economic alliance, which relies on central cities to drive overall regional economic development, is the enterprises. The government and relevant departments should, under the guidance of national planning and macro-control, organize, plan, coordinate, and supervise enterprise alliances, acting as matchmakers, while avoiding excessive administrative interference or inappropriate intervention. This ensures the rational flow of various production factors.

The success of the enterprises' performance depends on whether the government has built a solid stage and whether various production factors can flow rationally within the region.

The 18 cities, based on the principles of voluntarism, equality, and mutual benefit, have successively promoted the formation of four major common markets: consumer goods, materials, finance, and technology.

Consumer Goods Market: Each city has opened its local market to others, through large commodity trade fairs, setting up windows, and joint stores, achieving a circulation and sales volume of over 10 billion yuan among the cities in the region over the past three years.

Materials Market: From the initial single-item material exchange, it has developed into "mutual markets, mutual inventory, joint purchasing, and joint sales," with a material cooperation amount of 1.4 billion yuan. This has played an important role in easing regional market supply difficulties, stabilizing prices, and maintaining market stability.

Financial Market: Over 70 financial institutions in the region have fully utilized time differences and regional differences, reformed settlement methods, and accelerated the horizontal flow of funds, organizing financing of over 6 billion yuan in the past three years.

Technology Market: The science and technology commissions of each city have signed joint agreements, achieving a regional network for the technology market, with nearly 2,000 horizontal exchanges of achievements.

The formation of these four major markets and numerous professional networks has promoted the optimization of regional industry, product structure, and production force layout, providing conditions to enhance the vitality of enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises.

According to incomplete statistics, over the past three years, the cities have signed over 1,800 economic cooperation projects, with an annual increase in production value of 826 million yuan and an increase in taxes of 118 million yuan for the implemented projects.

Enterprise cooperation has taken three main forms: single-item economic and technological cooperation, organizing joint production around famous and high-quality products, and forming enterprise groups with key enterprises as the backbone.

The "Panda" Electronic Group, composed of 164 enterprises, has a group production value of 800 million yuan. The radio factories in Anqing, Wuhu, and Nanchang, in cooperation with the Nanjing Radio Factory, produce the Panda brand television sets, with an annual output of 200,000 units and a production value of nearly 100 million yuan. Last year, they jointly developed a series of products including the Panda brand stereo phonograph, thin radio, new-type desk tape recorder, and refrigerator.

Meanwhile, small enterprises in Huangshan, Liu'an, and Xuancheng have utilized local tea, aquatic products, wood, and other specialties, introduced technology, and implemented a combination of raw material bases and processing enterprises, with both parties gaining obvious benefits.

In the process of rectification and adjustment, the focus has shifted from expanding external cooperation to enriching internal cooperation. Nanjing Municipal Party Secretary Zhang Yaohua said: Currently, we need to shorten the frontline, concentrate our efforts on enterprises that produce famous, high-quality, new, and special products and export-oriented products as the "dragon head," guide enterprises to meet market demands, and continuously increase effective supply.

One of the main contents of the transformation of regional cooperation is to open up areas of cooperation that do not increase or minimally increase investment, such as technological progress, enterprise management, talent training, information exchange, agency import and export, joint purchasing and sales, etc. These "software" cooperations are not only an indispensable aspect of regional cooperation but can also promote the input-output of the previous three years of "hardware" cooperation to achieve greater benefits. Recently, the Coordination Conference commissioned Southeast University to hold a training class for officials of outward-looking economies and commissioned the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory to hold two sessions of enterprise management optimization training classes, both of which had good results. The intellectual cooperation in the cooperation area has begun to shift from the past mutual exchange of surplus and deficit to the joint training of talents and improvement of personnel quality.

The Nanjing Regional Economic Coordination Conference further proposed the idea and requirements for compiling a regional economic joint development plan. The purpose is to, based on the local conditions and national industrial policies, consider the interests of all parties, form a joint development blueprint with both strategic vision and practical feasibility, and gradually establish a relatively stable regional industrial structure system that can play to the strengths of all parties. This signifies that the Nanjing regional economic cooperation is no longer a temporary measure but a long-term plan for the economic development of the vast area of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; externally, it signifies that the 18 cities will, with a more effective and broader regional image, cooperate more effectively and extensively with domestic and foreign enterprises.

### 走向更有效的联合——南京区域经济协调会三年实践述评

    走向更有效的联合
    ——南京区域经济协调会三年实践述评
    本报记者　朱维群
    南京区域经济协调会，包括江苏的南京、镇江、扬州，安徽的合肥、芜湖、马鞍山、铜陵、安庆、黄山、淮南、滁县、六安、宣城、巢湖、池州，江西的南昌、九江、景德镇。这18地市道路相通，习俗相似，经济类型比较接近，历史上就存在较多经济文化往来。
    建国以来，由于条块分割、城乡分割旧体制的影响，许多联系被人为削弱以至割裂。1986年18地市成立协调会，使这一区域的整体性优势从分散走向联合，为企业提供了宽广得多的经营舞台。
    协调会确定了一条明确的活动方针：
  “政府搭台，部门推动，企业唱戏”。以中心城市为依托、带动整个地区经济发展的区域性、网络型的经济联合体，其基础是企业。政府和主管部门要在服从国家计划指导和宏观控制的前提下对企业联合进行组织、规划、协调、督促，当好“红娘”，同时避免以过多行政手段去硬性拼凑或不适当地干预。使各种生产要素合理流动
    企业的戏能否唱得有声有色，关键要看政府的台是否搭得牢靠，各种生产要素能否在区域内合理流动起来。
    18地市在自愿平等、互利互惠的基础上先后促进形成消费品、物资、金融和科技四大共同市场。
    消费品市场：各地市互相开放本地市场，通过大型商品交易会、互设窗口、联合办店等形式，3年来使区域内各地市之间流通经销额达100多亿元。
    物资市场：由起初的单项物资调剂串换，发展到“互为市场，互为库存，联购联销”，物资协作金额14亿元，为缓解区域市场供应困难、平抑物价、稳定市场发挥了重要作用。
    金融市场：区域内70多家金融机构充分利用时间差、地区差，改革结算办法，加速资金横向流动，3年中组织融资60多亿元。
    科技市场：各地市科委签署了联合协议，实现了科技市场区域联网，横向交流成果近2000项。
    四大市场和众多专业网络的形成促进了区域产业、产品结构和生产力布局的优化，为增强企业、尤其是大中型企业的活力提供了条件。
    据不完全统计，3年来各地市之间共签订经济协作项目1800多项，其中已实施部分每年新增产值8.26亿元，新增利税1.18亿元。
    企业合作出现三种主要形式：单项经济技术协作，围绕名优产品组织联合生产、以骨干企业为依托形成企业集团。
    由164家企业组成的“熊猫”电子集团，集团产值达8亿元。安庆、芜湖、南昌等市无线电厂与南京无线电厂联合生产的熊猫电视机，年产20万台，产值近亿元。去年又联合开发出熊猫牌立体电唱机、薄型收音机、新型台式收录机和电冰箱等系列产品。
    与此同时，黄山、六安、宣城等地一批小企业利用当地茶叶、水产、木材等土特产品，引进技术，实行原材料基地与加工企业的联合，双方都获得明显收益。在治理整顿中深化联合
    去年下半年以来国家压缩基建规模，抽紧银根，对重要生产物资实行专营，客观上使区域性物资和金融协作的难度增加。治理整顿，使区域合作也面临一个以扩大外延为主转入以充实内涵为主的转轨问题。南京市委书记张耀华说：当前要缩短战线，把力量集中到名、优、新、特产品和创汇产品为“龙头”的企业联合，引导企业贴近市场需求，不断增加有效供给。
    区域协作转轨变型主要内容之一是开辟那些不增加或少增加投资的合作领域，如科技进步、企业管理、人才培训、信息交流、代理进出口、联购联销等。这些“软件”的联合不仅是区域协作不可少的一个方面，而且可以促使前三年“硬件”的联合投入产出更大效益。最近协调会委托东南大学举办了外向型经济干部培训班，委托南京第二机床厂办了两期优化企业管理培训班，都收到很好的效果。协作区域的智力协作开始由过去的互通有无、调剂余缺，向共同培训人才、提高人员素质方向发展。
    南京区域经济协调会还进一步提出编制区域经济联合发展规划的设想和要求。其目的是根据区情和国家产业政策，兼顾各方利益，形成一个既有战略远景又有现实可行性的联合发展蓝图，逐步建立一个能够发挥各方优势的互补的相对稳固的区域产业结构体系。这标志着南京区域经济联合已不再是权宜之计，而是长江中下游这一广阔地域经济发展的长远之计；对外标志着18地市将以区域整体形象更有效更广泛地同海内外企业联手。
