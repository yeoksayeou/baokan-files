The Henan team has long been without a champion in swimming. Some people say that the carp from Henan cannot leap over the dragon gate. However, in the second National Youth Games swimming competition, they won 6 gold medals. This is not a stroke of luck; sports are a hard-fought battle, and everything is achieved through step-by-step efforts.

Henan has historically had poor swimming conditions. In the past, athletes had to train in the summer and autumn, and in the winter and spring, they had to stay on land, or like migratory birds, fly to other provinces and cities for training. The people of Henan have awakened from their repeated failures and decided to build swimming pools to create the necessary conditions for the development of swimming.

After building the pools, they sent experienced coaches to select talents in cities like Xinyang, Anyang, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Shangqiu. They also made the Zhengzhou Sports School a key focus, selecting a group of children with good physical qualities and water affinity for systematic training. Bao Xin, who won multiple gold medals in the second National Youth Games swimming competition, is a typical example of their talent selection. At the time, the coach conducted various tests on Bao Xin and believed he was a good material for swimming. Indeed, he has now grown to 1.80 meters, taller than his peers by a head, and his jumping and strength are also outstanding. Bao Xin is only 15 years old this year, and he will be even more impressive when he reaches full maturity.

For a province with a weak swimming foundation, improving the level of coaches is particularly important. The six coaches from Henan have a strong desire for knowledge. They continuously absorb advanced domestic and international experiences. When coaches from the Democratic Republic of Germany came to China to teach, they traveled thousands of miles to attend the classes. They also subscribe to various foreign swimming magazines, finding new methods that can be combined with local conditions. Their training methods become more diverse, and their theoretical understanding is elevated. They summarized their training experience into a catchphrase: "Aerobic, endurance, and quantity are the foundation, intensity is the core, strength is the key, and technique is the expression."

### 喜看“鲤鱼跃龙门”——河南队获二青会游泳6枚金牌的启示

　　喜看“鲤鱼跃龙门”
　　——河南队获二青会游泳6枚金牌的启示
    河南省游泳队多年与冠军无缘。有人说，河南的“鲤鱼跃不过龙门”。可是，在第二届全国青运会游泳赛中，他们夺得6枚金牌。这可不是撞大运，体育运动硬碰硬，完全是靠一步步努力争取到的。
    河南历来游泳条件差，过去运动员训练由于没有游泳馆，只好夏秋入水，冬春当旱鸭子，或者像候鸟飞到别的省市去训练。河南的同志，在一次次失利中觉悟过来，下决心建馆，为发展游泳创造必要的条件。
    建起了馆，他们又派有经验的教练到信阳、安阳、洛阳、开封、商丘等地选苗，并把郑州体校当作重点，挑选出一批身体素质好、水感好的少儿进行系统训练。二青会游泳赛获得多枚金牌的鲍欣就是他们选苗的典型。当时，教练对鲍欣进行多种测试，认为他是块游泳的好材料，果然现在长到1.80米，比同年龄的高出一个头，弹跳和力量也出色。鲍欣今年才15岁，等到发育成熟将更为可观。
    对于一个游泳基础差的省来讲，提高教练的水平尤为重要。河南的6名教练有一股强烈的求知欲望，他们不断吸取国内外的先进经验。民主德国教练来华讲课，他们千里迢迢赶去听课。他们还订阅各种国外游泳杂志，从中找出和当地能够结合的新方法，训练的路子越来越广，办法越来越多，理论上也得到升华。他们在训练中总结出这样的顺口溜：“有氧、耐力、数量是基础，强度是核心，力量最关键，技术来表现。”　本报记者　黄振中
