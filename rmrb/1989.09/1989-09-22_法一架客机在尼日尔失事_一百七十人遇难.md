A French airliner belonging to the French Union of Transport Companies crashed in the Sahara Desert in Niger. All 170 people on board were killed.

According to reports, the DC-10 aircraft disappeared yesterday afternoon at around 3 PM while en route from N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, to Paris. It was not until this morning that it was preliminarily confirmed that the plane had crashed in the Ténéré Desert, approximately 650 kilometers from N'Djamena.

The plane was carrying 170 people, including 15 crew members, all of whom perished. Most of the passengers were from Africa, with a smaller number from the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Among the victims were the wife of the U.S. Ambassador to Chad and the Minister of Planning of Chad.

An official from the French Union of Transport Companies suggested that the cause of the crash might have been a bomb explosion. He also mentioned that all the crew members were French and that the pilot was an experienced flyer.

    法一架客机在尼日尔失事
    一百七十人遇难
    本报巴黎9月20日电  法国联合航空运输公司的一架DC—10型客机昨天下午3时许从乍得首都恩贾梅纳飞往巴黎途中突然失踪，直到今天早晨才初步确定该机可能坠毁在离恩贾梅纳650公里处的特内雷（尼日尔境内）大沙漠中。
    据报道，机上170人，包括15名机组人员全部遇难。
    机上大多是非洲乘客，还有一部分美国、法国、意大利和瑞士乘客。美国驻乍得大使夫人和乍得计划部长亦同机遇难。
    法国联合航空运输公司的官员说，这起空难事故的原因有可能是因炸弹爆炸造成的。他还说，机组成员都是法国人，其中机长是具有丰富飞行经验的驾驶员。
