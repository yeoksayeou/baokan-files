Xinhua News Agency, Lima, September 22nd.

Peruvian Senate President Carlos Torres Vargas expressed support for China's measures to suppress the unrest on September 22nd to Chinese Ambassador to Peru, Zhu Xiangzhong.

He said, "Peru has deeply suffered from anti-government subversive activities and deeply understands the importance of safeguarding the constitution and the law. Therefore, we understand the measures taken by the Chinese government to quell the riots."

Torres Vargas said, "After the Beijing incident, pro-imperialist forces have made many distorted reports about China. Peru has always adhered to the principles of self-determination and non-interference, opposing the interference of big powers in the internal affairs of other countries."
