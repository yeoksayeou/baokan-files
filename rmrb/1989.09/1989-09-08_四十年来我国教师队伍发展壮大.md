Over the past four decades, the number of full-time teachers in ordinary higher education institutions has grown from 16,000 in 1949 to 393,200 in 1988, including 111,000 female teachers. The structure of the teaching workforce has undergone significant changes. By 1988, the number of professors and associate professors had reached 93,600, accounting for approximately 23.8% of the total. Among them, there were 14,800 professors and 78,800 associate professors.

Agricultural and vocational middle schools were established after the founding of the People's Republic in 1958. During the "Cultural Revolution," these schools suffered severe damage and were nearly destroyed. Recovery and development began in the 1980s, with rapid growth in the past five years. The number of full-time teachers in these schools was 60,000 in 1958, 197,000 in 1965, and very few from 1966 to 1979. In 1980, there were 23,000 teachers, and by 1988, this number had reached 202,800 (including 59,400 female teachers). Among the full-time teachers, there were 25,600 junior high school teachers, with 5,430 having a college degree or higher, accounting for 21.18% of the total number of junior high school teachers. There were 177,200 senior high school teachers, with 35,827 having a bachelor's degree or higher, accounting for 20.22% of the total number of senior high school teachers.

The number of full-time teachers in ordinary high schools increased from 14,000 in 1949 to 556,900 in 1988 (including 139,600 female teachers). Among them, 230,000 teachers had qualified education, with a qualification rate of 41.3%.

The number of full-time teachers in ordinary junior high schools increased from 53,000 in 1949 to 2,402,700 by the end of 1988, including 733,700 female teachers. Among the full-time teachers, 856,000 had qualified education, with a qualification rate of 35.6%. Additionally, 28,000 teachers had obtained a "professional qualification certificate."

The number of full-time teachers in primary schools has seen particularly significant growth, increasing from 836,000 in 1949 to 5,501,300 in 1988, including 2,284,400 female teachers. Among the full-time teachers, 3,478,000 had qualified education, with a qualification rate of 68.1%. Additionally, 166,300 teachers had obtained a "professional qualification certificate."

Special education schools have received attention from the government and society, leading to rapid development, especially in the past few years. The number of full-time teachers in these schools increased from 400 in 1953 to 4,000 in 1977, and to 10,800 in 1988, including 7,800 female teachers.

The development of early childhood education has also been rapid. The number of kindergarten teachers increased from 17,000 in 1950 to 670,400 in 1988, including 634,100 female teachers.

Adult higher education institutions have gradually developed since the founding of the People's Republic. The number of full-time teachers increased from 297 in 1955 to 83,900 in 1988, including 26,400 female teachers. The number of teachers with senior professional titles has significantly increased, with the number of professors and associate professors reaching 10,900.
