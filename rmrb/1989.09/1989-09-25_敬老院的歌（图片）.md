Since 1982, the government of Junyadiping Township in Yueling County, Hunan Province, has established a nursing home. The nursing home not only takes care of the elderly's needs for food, clothing, and shelter but also organizes cultural and entertainment activities for them. Look, the melody of "Socialism is Good" is playing from the hearts of the elderly.

    敬老院的歌
    湖南省沅陵县军大坪乡政府自1982年建立敬老院以来，不仅关心孤寡老人的吃、穿、住，还组织他们开展文娱活动。瞧，《社会主义好》的唢呐声正飞出老人的心房。
