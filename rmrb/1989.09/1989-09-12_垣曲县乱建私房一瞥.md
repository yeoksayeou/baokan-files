The construction of private houses in the urban areas of Yuanqu County has encountered several issues due to the lack of unified planning and proper guidance.

The number of households building new homes has surged, leading to a significant reduction in arable land. At the beginning of this year, in Yuanqu County, which has only 6,000 residents, 93 households started building new homes, an increase of 47.3% compared to the same period last year. From the second half of last year to the present, 74,400 square meters of arable land in the suburbs of Yuanqu County have been occupied by private house construction.

Many households are building homes with loans, leading to high debts. According to a survey of 30 households, each household has an average debt of over 8,000 yuan for building a new home. Among the 5 households that have moved into their new homes, all have debts exceeding 10,000 yuan. One worker invested 52,300 yuan in building a new home, of which 20,000 yuan was borrowed from the bank and 19,000 yuan was borrowed from private individuals.

Many residents are investing heavily in homes to show off, with 30 households each investing an average of 16,200 yuan, with the highest investment reaching 75,000 yuan. However, the average annual savings per household is only 1,100 yuan. The construction boom has led some people to build homes regardless of their actual financial situation, even resorting to unethical means to acquire funds.

The lack of planning has resulted in chaotic construction. Due to weak management of private house construction and differences in residents' economic conditions, the private houses are of varying quality. For example, in the residential area of Nan Street in Yuanqu County, there are both single-story and two-story houses, with different styles, which are neither aesthetically pleasing nor efficient in land use.

Many projects are being carried out without proper design and construction permits. Due to the low quality of construction workers and the lack of certified designs and construction permits, the housing quality is poor and the costs are high. According to a survey by relevant departments, out of 601 construction projects, 87.8% were designed without permits and 80.9% were constructed without permits.

### 垣曲县乱建私房一瞥

　　垣曲县乱建私房一瞥
    我县城镇兴建私房，由于缺乏统一规划，正确引导，出现了不少问题。
    建房户剧增，耕地面积锐减。今年初，仅有6000户居民的垣曲县城，新增建房户93家，比去年同期增加47.3％。去年下半年至今，垣曲县城郊共有7.44万平方米的耕地被私人建房占用。
    负债建房，债台高筑。据30个建房户调查统计，每户建房负债均为8000多元。住进新房的5户居民负债均在万元以上，一职工建房投资5.23万元，其中向银行贷款2万元，借私人款1.9万元。
    不顾实际，投资惊人。不少居民为讲排场，摆阔气，投资惊人。30个建房户每户平均投资1.62万元，最多的达7.5万元。而每户居民一年节余只有1100元。建房热刺激一些人不顾实际建私房，甚至不择手段捞取钱财。
    缺乏规划，建筑混乱。因对私人建房管理不力，加上居民经济条件有差别，因此私房建筑参差不齐。如垣曲县南街家属区私房，有平房，有二层楼房，式样各异，既不美观，又浪费了土地。
    无证设计，盲目上马。由于建筑工人素质低，加之无证设计和施工，住房质次价高。有关部门调查了601个建设项目，无证设计的占87.8％，施工的占80.9％。
