Professor Lin Weishen of Inner Mongolia Agricultural College has recently been awarded the title of "Patriotic and Military Support Model" by the Autonomous Region Government and the Inner Mongolia Military Region. For 13 years, he has been tirelessly assisting and guiding the vegetable planting efforts of border defense units in high-altitude, cold regions. Over the years, Professor Lin has traversed the 8,000-mile border defense line, which stretches across the Gobi Desert and vast forests. He established the first greenhouse and plastic greenhouse on the Gobi Desert. For the border defense units, he meticulously compiled an 80,000-character vegetable cultivation manual. He has helped the units organize dozens of training sessions, training over 1,000 personnel in vegetable cultivation. Now, many border defense units along the northern frontier of the motherland can enjoy fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and other vegetables year-round. The officers and soldiers guarding the border will never forget the name Lin Weishen.
