On the evening of September 21st at around 6:30 PM, Mr. Okazaki returned home, carrying a briefcase under his right arm and holding some letters in his left hand as he ascended the stairs. Suddenly, a strange noise was heard, and his family rushed to the scene, only to find Mr. Okazaki lying unconscious at the foot of the stairs. He was immediately rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, but he did not regain consciousness and passed away at 2:51 AM the next morning.

Mr. Okazaki's eldest son, Okazaki Bin, told the reporter that his father had been in good health, although his legs had weakened in recent years. On that day, his father was alone when he fell down the stairs. The cause of the fall might have been that he was carrying a briefcase under his right arm, making it difficult for him to hold the handrail firmly. The fall resulted in injuries to his brain and nervous system, diagnosed as "acute subdural hematoma," and despite efforts to save him, he passed away.

Throughout his 92 years, Mr. Okazaki left a lasting legacy. Born on April 16, 1897, in Okayama Prefecture, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at Tokyo Imperial University. After entering society, he became a distinguished businessman, serving as the president and chairman of Ikemoto Iron Works, president of Maruzen Oil Company, vice president of Japan Helicopter Transport Company, chairman of All Nippon Airways, and president of the Japan Aviation Association. He was also a pioneer in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, serving as the chairman of the Japan-China Comprehensive Trade Liaison Council, representative of the Japan-China Trade Memorandum Office, permanent advisor to the Japan-China Economic Association, advisor to the Japan-China Friendship Association, advisor to the Japan-China Agricultural and Farmers Exchange Association, and president of the Japan-China Youth Training Association. For many years, he worked tirelessly in various fields to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

Mr. Okazaki's funeral was held at Honmonji Temple, not far from his home, and mourners came in an unending stream. At the request of the reporter, Mr. Okazaki's eldest son allowed a glimpse of Mr. Okazaki's remains. The coffin was opened, revealing Mr. Okazaki lying peacefully, as if in deep sleep, his features calm and seemingly younger than usual. When the reporter saw that Mr. Okazaki's body was neatly adorned with 10 small photographs and one large framed photograph measuring about 40 cm by 20 cm, he was astonished. Okazaki Bin explained that the 10 small photographs were taken during his father's visits to China with his grandchildren. The large photograph was his father's favorite picture of Premier Zhou Enlai, a photograph that many Chinese people find deeply moving: Premier Zhou Enlai, dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, sitting sideways on a sofa, his piercing gaze fixed on the left front. Mrs. Okazaki, Tsuko, said that before his death, Okazaki had expressed his wish to have Premier Zhou Enlai's photograph placed beside him and to be cremated together, as a symbol of his lifelong friendship with Premier Zhou.

Mr. Okazaki had met Premier Zhou Enlai on more than 20 occasions and held a deep affection for him, a story of Sino-Japanese friendship that has been widely circulated and is a symbol of the sincere friendship between the peoples of the two countries. During his lifetime, Mr. Okazaki always carried Premier Zhou Enlai's photograph in his pocket. In his office, the most prominent feature was a large portrait of Premier Zhou Enlai. Whenever he spoke about China, Mr. Okazaki would inevitably mention Premier Zhou Enlai. Each time he spoke of Premier Zhou, he could not help but have tears welling up in his eyes. He gave many lectures in various parts of Japan, speaking about Premier Zhou's patched shirt and his story with the barber, introducing Premier Zhou's outstanding character and noble virtues. Mr. Okazaki once said, "If I leave this world, in the afterlife, the first person I hope to see is Premier Zhou Enlai. I would be happy to be able to chat with him again about our friendship." People wish that there truly is an afterlife to fulfill Mr. Okazaki's sincere and pure wish.

For decades, Mr. Okazaki worked tirelessly to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. In the early 1960s, before the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, advocating for "Sino-Japanese friendship" in Japan was met with disdain. Mr. Okazaki, along with other pioneers of Sino-Japanese friendship such as Matsumura Kenzo and Takasugi Michio, worked together to establish the Japan-China Trade Memorandum Office, laying the foundation for trade and personnel exchanges between the two countries. He also worked tirelessly to achieve the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China. When issues like the Guanghua Dormitory arose, Mr. Okazaki always stepped forward and spoke out in defense. Despite his busy schedule, he would meet with Chinese students and appeal to Japanese society to provide assistance, helping foreign students overcome difficulties. Mr. Okazaki visited China over 100 times, often bringing his grandchildren, not only personally promoting Sino-Japanese friendship but also educating his descendants, hoping that the peoples of Japan and China would be friends for generations to come. His 101st planned visit to China, scheduled for this month, could not be realized due to his passing, but his firm belief and ardent hope for the development of Sino-Japanese friendship will inspire future generations to carry on his legacy. The passing of Mr. Okazaki is a great loss to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship, and the Chinese people have lost a respected old friend. His contributions will be recorded in the annals of Sino-Japanese friendship and will forever be remembered by the peoples of both countries.

The spirit of Okazaki lives on!

    冈崎精神不死
    本报记者　于青
    9月21日傍晚6时30分许，冈崎先生回到家中，右腋下夹着公文包，左手拿着信件，走上楼梯。忽然，一阵异常的响动，家人闻声赶来，只见冈崎先生倒在楼梯口，已经昏迷不醒，立即送医院抢救，直到次日凌晨2时51分停止呼吸，老人再也没能清醒过来。
    冈崎先生长子冈崎彬告诉记者，父亲平时身体很健康，只是近年腿力渐弱。那天父亲上楼时，没有家人在场。摔下楼梯的原因，可能是由于右腋下夹着公文包，右手不能自由有力地扶住楼梯扶手。摔下来后，使脑血管和神经系统受到损伤，医生诊断为“急性硬膜下血肿”，经抢救无效去世。
    在92年的人生道路上，冈崎先生留下了坚实的足迹。冈崎先生1897年4月16日生于冈山县，东大法学系毕业。走向社会后，他成为业绩卓著的实业家，历任池贝铁工公司社长和会长、丸善石油公司社长、日本直升机运输公司副社长、全日空公司董事长、日本航空协会会长等。他还是中日友好事业的掘井人，曾任日中综合贸易联络协议会会长、日中贸易备忘录办事处代表、日中经济协会常任顾问、日中友好协会顾问、日中农业农民交流协会顾问、日中青年研修协会会长等，多年在广泛领域里为促进中日友好努力不懈。
    冈崎先生的灵堂设在离他家不远的本门寺内，前来吊唁的人络绎不绝。记者恳请冈崎先生长子允许，瞻仰了冈崎先生的遗容。灵柩掀开，只见先生静静躺着，似乎在酣睡，容貌安详，好像比平日显得年轻。当看到先生的身上整齐地摆放10枚小照片和1枚长约40厘米、宽约20厘米、镶框的大照片时，记者惊呆了。长子冈崎彬说，那10枚小照片是他父亲生前与儿孙们去中国时的留影。那枚大照片是他父亲最喜欢的一幅周总理的照片。也是许多中国人见之动情的那幅照片：周总理身着灰色中山装，侧身坐在沙发上，炯炯有神的目光凝视着左前方。冈崎先生夫人时子女士说，冈崎生前有言，死后要把周总理的照片放在身边，一起火化，以示至死不忘与周总理的友谊。
    冈崎先生前后共20几次见到过周总理，他对周总理一往情深，成为中日友好的佳话广为流传，也是中日两国人民真诚友谊的象征。冈崎生前，衣袋里一直装着周总理的照片。他的办公室里，最醒目的是那张周总理的巨幅照片。与人谈起中国，冈崎必然要谈周总理。每次说起周总理，他都禁不住热泪盈眶。他在日本各地多次讲演，讲周总理身穿打补丁的衬衣、讲周总理与理发师的故事，介绍周总理杰出的人品和高尚情操。冈崎先生曾向人说起：“如果我离开人间，在九泉之下第一个希望就是见到周总理，我将为能再次与周总理畅叙友谊而感到幸福。”人们宁愿相信确有九泉，以实现冈崎先生真诚纯洁的夙愿。
    冈崎先生数十年如一日，为发展中日友好开路架桥。中日邦交正常化前的60年代初，在日本提倡“日中友好”是遭白眼的。冈崎先生与松村谦三、高碕达之助等日中友好事业的先驱共同努力，建立了中日贸易备忘录办事处，为中日贸易往来和人员交流奠定了基石。他还为实现日中邦交正常化、缔结日中和平友好条约不畏艰难、多方奔走。光华寮等问题出现后，冈崎先生总是挺身而出、仗义执言，他还在百忙中平易近人地会见中国留学生，并呼吁日本社会多方协助，为外国留学生排忧解难。冈崎先生曾访问中国100次，其中多次带着自己的儿孙，不仅自己为促进日中友好身体力行，还面向未来，教育晚辈，愿日中两国人民世世代代友好。原订本月28日的第101次访华，因先生逝世未能成行，但他对日中友好事业发展的坚定信念和满腔热望将激励后人继承他的遗志。冈崎先生的逝世是中日友好事业的重大损失，使中国人民失去了一位尊敬的老朋友，他的功绩将载入中日友好史册，永远铭记在两国人民心中。
