Since May this year, the commercial system of Langfang City has established 13 standard-price and lowest-price stores.

The lowest-price store in the picture is located on the east side of Xinhua Road in Langfang City, Hebei Province. Here, the same product, the same specification, the same time, the same market, the price is the lowest. Since it was established on June 17th, it has had a significant impact on the Langfang market, with customers flocking in. In June-August this year, a small store run by a few employees had a turnover of 1.1785 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 times over the same period last year, and taxes and profits increased by 43.6%.

This is one of the moves made by the commercial system of Langfang City to stabilize market prices. Langfang City can be considered a new satellite city, with roughly the same distance to Beijing and Tianjin, about 60 kilometers away. Prices are easily influenced by large cities. This spring, the mayor clearly stated that measures must be taken to control the price index. The leaders of the commercial system of the city began to ponder how state-owned commerce can play a model role in stabilizing prices. They conducted market surveys and found that the channels for purchasing goods are now diverse, and prices are chaotic. Additionally, some individuals and units are arbitrarily raising prices, making it urgent for the main channels to have a fair price for goods. Therefore, they decided to select 11 stores or shopping malls in the city, district, and county that have a close relationship with people's lives, good staff quality, and a good foundation for management to establish standard-price stores. Two stores with guaranteed supply sources were established as lowest-price stores. Stores implementing standard prices strictly enforce the regulated factory prices, purchase-sale price differences, and regional price differences for industrial products with national unified prices. For industrial products with national guidance prices, they strictly control the purchase-sale price difference, only allowing it to float downwards, not upwards. For products with prices set by enterprises, they limit them to the mid-to-low level within the same market.

This is a very complex task. With the help of the price management department, these 13 stores spent nearly a month strictly reviewing, auditing, and setting prices for the 50 categories and 13,000 types of goods they operate, such as needles, textiles, stationery, and textiles.

Of course, it is not easy to do a good job. The establishment of 13 standard-price and lowest-price stores has received mixed reactions. Consumers welcome it, saying that with such national stores, they have a benchmark when buying things. Some people say it's like a rabbit's tail—it won't last long. The reasoning is: when things can't be sold, it's fine, but when a buying frenzy comes, you won't be able to sustain it. Some peers also have objections: Langfang is such a small place, if you sell more, I'll sell less, aren't you deliberately creating problems? Some people are skeptical: is that really the lowest price, or are you fooling the people? Some even deliberately lower the price of one or two items to see if the lowest-price store can handle it.

The leaders of the commercial system and the managers of these 13 stores have carefully studied these issues: First, the establishment of standard-price and lowest-price stores aims to stabilize prices. State-owned commerce is the main channel in the circulation sector and has the obligation and ability to do so, and it must be persisted with; Second, say what you do, don't just put on a show, and gain the trust of the people; Third, fair competition, don't fight with peers, stabilizing prices does not mean making losses on purpose.

Several months of practice have proven that the guiding ideology and methods of the commercial system's experimenters are correct, and they have earned credibility. An elderly man wanted to buy a floor fan and came to the Langfang City Household Appliance Company's exhibition hall. He looked around but doubted it wasn't the lowest price, so he went to other stores in the city. In the end, he returned to the household appliance company's exhibition hall and told the salesperson, "I've been around a lot, and your store's price is still the lowest." He asked the salesperson to help him pick one and happily bought it.

    稳定市场物价的尝试
    自今年5月以来，廊坊市一商系统建立了13家标准价、最低价商店
    本报记者　张雅心　江绍高
    照片上的这家最低价商店，坐落在河北廊坊市新华路东侧。在这里，同一商品，同一规格，同一时间，同一市场，价格最低。自今年6月17日挂牌以来，对廊坊市市场产生了明显的影响，顾客盈门。今年6—8月，几名职工的小店，营业额达117.85万元，比去年同期增长1.3倍，利税增长43.6％。
    这是廊坊市一商系统稳定市场价格的一招。廊坊市可算一个新兴的卫星城，到北京、天津的距离差不多，60公里左右。物价很容易受到大城市的影响。今年春天，市长明确提出，要想办法控制物价指数，市一商系统的领导就琢磨开了，国营商业在平抑物价中如何起模范作用。他们进行市场调查，有一点很清楚，现在的商品进货渠道多，价格很乱；再加上一些人、一些单位乱涨价，迫切需要主渠道对商品有一个公正的价格。于是，他们决定在市、区、县选择经营商品与群众生活关系密切、职工素质好、经营管理有较好基础的11家商店或商场，建立标准价商店，两家货源有保证的商店建立最低价商店。实行标准价的商店，对国家统一定价的工业品严格执行规定的出厂价、进销差价和地区差价；对国家实行指导价格的工业品，严格控制进销差率，只下浮，不上浮；对企业自行定价的商品价格，限于同一市场内的中下水平。
    这是一项很不简单的工作，这13家商店在物价管理部门的帮助下，用近一个月的时间，对所经营的针、百、文、纺等50类、13000种商品进行严格核价、审价、定价。
    当然，要办好一件事并不容易。建立13家标准价、最低价商店，反映也不一。消费者很欢迎，有国家这样的商店镇着，买东西心里有个准。也有人说是兔子尾巴——长不了，道理是：东西卖不出去时可以，抢购风一来，你就搞不下去。有的同行也有意见，廊坊就这么大地方，你卖多了，我就得少卖，这不是存心出难题。也有群众半信半疑：你那是不是最低价，莫不是糊弄老百姓。还有的故意拣出一两种商品把价压得低低的，看你最低价商店受不受得了。
    一商系统的领导和这13家商店的经理们，仔细地研究过这些问题：第一，建立标准价和最低价商店，目的是平抑物价，国营商业是流通领域的主渠道，有这个义务，也有这个能力，一定要坚持下去；第二，说到做到，不搞花架子，取信于民；第三，公平竞争，不与同行斗气，平抑物价不等于专做赔本买卖。
    几个月的实践证明，一商系统的尝试者们的指导思想和作法是正确的，他们赢得了信誉。有位老大爷想买一个落地扇，来到市家用电器公司展销部，看了又看，但他怀疑不是最低价，又到市里其他商店转悠，最后还是转到家电公司展销部，对售货员说，我转了一大圈，还是你们店的价格最低。他请售货员帮助挑了一个，高高兴兴买走了。
