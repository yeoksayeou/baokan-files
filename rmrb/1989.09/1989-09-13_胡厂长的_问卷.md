A small car is speeding along the highway from Shanxi to Inner Mongolia. Hu Xinhua, the director of the No. 2 Chemical Factory in Yuanping County, Shanxi Province, has left his home and will arrive in Baotou by evening. Baotou is an important base for rare earth production in China. In 1987, "Chemical No. 2" developed high-quality rare earth products for the rare earth phase two project, and this time he is going to Baotou again.

Hu Xinhua has no interest in the scenery outside the car. He casually takes out a stack of papers from his bag, and a smile instantly appears on his face. This is his beloved item: a survey. Hu Xinhua has been the director for a few years, and the annual profit and taxes of "Chemical No. 2" have increased from over 300,000 yuan to over 1,000,000 yuan. The number of employees has also increased from over 200 to over 800. With so many people and so much work, he spends one-third of his time traveling, making it impossible for him to frequently have heart-to-heart talks with the employees. The revitalization of the enterprise relies on the efforts of all employees. If he does not understand the employees' demands, how can he mobilize their enthusiasm? Hu Xinhua thought long and hard and carefully designed the "Employee Survey." Every year, he prints and distributes it to the employees, one per person. It has various columns. Workers can freely fill in what they want to say to the director, both official matters and personal affairs. Hu Xinhua carries the survey with him and looks at it from time to time.

Look, this survey was filled out by an old worker, and he proposed three technical reform suggestions. In recent years, the factory has implemented the method of promoting technological progress through group efforts by employees, encouraging employees to contribute ideas and suggestions. In the past two years, employees have proposed 4,800 rationalization suggestions through surveys and other channels. Many of these suggestions have been adopted, and among them, 21 items have created benefits of over 100,000 yuan.

Look, this survey was filled out by a young worker who applied to participate in correspondence courses. Hu Xinhua subconsciously said "approved." In recent years, "Chemical No. 2" has always emphasized intellectual investment, organizing employees to study politics, culture, and technology, cultivating a new generation of "Chemical No. 2" people with a scientific spirit who can fight and win tough battles.

Look, this survey was filled out by a young man who asked the director to help him with plastic surgery. Hu Xinhua immediately laughed, "Ha, this guy has a girlfriend!" As a director, how could he not help? In these years, employees have used surveys to propose various requests to the director, such as solving children's employment, solving two-place living, purchasing high-end home appliances, etc. The factory has done its best to satisfy these requests as much as possible. The factory cares for the employees, and the employees care for the factory. The rapid development of "Chemical No. 2" in recent years is the result of the efforts of all employees.

After looking at a few surveys, Hu Xinhua raised his head, as if he wanted to say something, but he did not speak. The wheels rolled on. His thoughts flew to the factory, to the employees...

　　胡厂长的“问卷”
　　闻采
    从山西到内蒙古的公路上，一辆小车正在急驶。山西省原平县化工二厂厂长胡新华朝辞家门，傍晚即将到达包头。包头是我国重要的稀土生产基地。一九八七年“化二”开发出优质稀土产品，为稀土二期工程事，这次他又上包头。
    胡新华无心于车外的千姿百态，顺手从提包中取出一迭纸，顿时，一丝笑意掠过脸庞。这可是他的心爱之物：问卷。胡新华就任厂长几年，“化二”年利税已从三十多万元增到一千多万元，职工也从二百多人增加到八百多人，人多事繁，他每年有三分之一的时间外出，不可能经常和职工促膝谈心。企业振兴靠全体职工的努力。如果不了解职工有什么要求，又怎能调动他们的积极性？胡新华思索再三，精心设计了“职工问卷”。每年印发职工，一人一份，上面有多种栏目。工人想和厂长说什么，就尽情填写，公事和私情都可以。胡新华将问卷随身携带，随时翻看。
    瞧，这张“问卷”是一位老工人填写的，他又提出三条技术改革设想。近年中厂部实行职工群体推动技术进步法，鼓励职工献计献策。这两年，职工通过问卷等途径提出合理化建议四千八百条，不少建议已被采纳，其中创造万元以上效益的就有二十一项。
    瞧，这张问卷上，一位青工提出了参加函授学习的申请。胡新华下意识地道出一个“准”字。“化二”这几年一直重视智力投资，组织职工学政治，学文化，学技术，培育了具有科学精神、能打硬仗胜仗的一代“化二”新人。
    瞧，这张“问卷”上，一位小伙子请厂长帮他美容。胡新华顿时乐了，“哈，这小子有意中人了！”作为厂长，怎能不成人之美。这些年，职工利用问卷向厂长提出过种种要求，如解决子女就业、解决两地生活、购买高档家电等。厂部竭尽所能，尽量予以满足。工厂关心职工，职工更关心工厂。“化二”这几年的迅速发展凝结着全厂职工的心血。
    看罢几张问卷，胡新华扬起头，似乎想说什么，却没有开口。车轮滚滚。他的思绪飞向工厂，飞向职工……
