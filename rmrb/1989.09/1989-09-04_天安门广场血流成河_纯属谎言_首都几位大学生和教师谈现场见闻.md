The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital has been exactly three months, and the truth about the clearing of Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4 has been fully revealed. However, the traitors who fled abroad, such as the leaders of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" Wu'er Kaixi, are still spreading lies about "blood flowing like a river in Tiananmen Square" and "3,000 people died in Tiananmen Square" ... Their lies have infuriated the students and teachers who witnessed the clearing of Tiananmen Square. Recently, some students and teachers have shared their experiences with Xinhua News Agency reporters.

Zhao Ming, a former member of the illegal "Preparation Committee" at Tsinghua University and a student in the Department of Engineering Physics, told the reporter that at 10 PM on June 3, he went to the east side of the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square and found the Tsinghua University contingent. At that time, he heard the loudspeakers of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" broadcasting that there were military forces in many places in Beijing, inciting people to block military vehicles. Soon, the loudspeakers broadcasted again, urging students to sit around the Monument to the People's Heroes. The Tsinghua University contingent was on the second layer of the south side of the monument, and there was also a flag of the Department of Radio Electronics on the east side. At that time, there were about 2,000 people around the monument, and the people on the square were sparse, the atmosphere tense. Some students said, "I want to taste the flavor of tear gas and police batons." Others were prepared to "fight to the death." Soon, an armored vehicle drove in from the south along the east side, and some people surrounded it. At that moment, I saw some soldiers running from the crowd, their heads bloodied. I heard people beside me say that some scattered soldiers had entered the square unarmed from the south and were beaten by some people. Around 11 PM, some students from the Military Museum said, "They are shooting over there!" Facing this situation, a few members of the Tsinghua University "Preparation Committee" held an emergency meeting, proposing to withdraw, but this was opposed by some who argued, "We cannot be deserters of the entire student contingent." Finally, we proposed sending someone to discuss withdrawal with other schools, but the discussion resulted in great disagreement and no decision was made. At this time, I saw someone carrying a light machine gun, which he had obtained from somewhere, walking towards the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" command post. Before this, gunshots could be heard from the west. After the martial law troops entered Tiananmen Square, they lined up in the Jinshui Bridge area, facing off against the student contingent.

The loudspeakers of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" broadcast the voices of Hou Dejian and others, saying that after negotiations with the military, they agreed to leave a passage for students and the public to withdraw from the southeast corner of the square. The students and the public around the monument were in chaos, with various opinions, and a vote was taken, with the voices calling for withdrawal being louder than those calling for persistence. Amidst this, a few gunshots were heard, and the loudspeakers of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" were silenced, but no students or public were seen injured or killed.

The student and public contingent then slowly withdrew towards the southeast. The tanks of the martial law troops from the north also slowly moved south. The soldiers and the patrol team at the end of the withdrawal contingent always maintained a distance of about 20-30 meters. I and some patrol team members were responsible for checking if there were any students in the tents south of the monument. The result was that there was no one. When withdrawing to the last, there were still a few public and students who did not want to leave the square. Thus, the patrol team members, holding hands, persuaded them to leave. At that time, there were still about 200 people in the southeast corner of the square, most of whom were patrol team members persuading others to leave, and among the dozens of people who did not want to withdraw, there were more public than students. After a standoff for some time, some martial law troops came from the direction of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, shouting, "If you don't provoke us, we won't provoke you! If you provoke us, we will retaliate!"

Those who did not want to withdraw saw this and scattered in panic. I walked west from the Front Gate and saw many burned and smashed military and other vehicles along the way. I left the Front Gate at 6:15 AM.

Xie Juanxiang, a student from Class 8552 at Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, was also a student who withdrew from Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4. She said, on the evening of June 3, I went to watch a movie with an old classmate who was studying at Tsinghua University. When we reached Dongsi, we heard that something had happened at Xidan. Unable to suppress our curiosity, we walked along Chang'an Street to Xidan. At Xidan, we saw a sea of people. After a while, we decided to return to school. When we reached Tiananmen Square, I was exhausted and sat down on the lawn north of the Museum of Chinese History.

I don't know how long it was, but suddenly the crowd behind me became restless, and someone was running in a panic. I stood up to see what was happening, but I couldn't see anything except the crowd. People around me said that someone was chasing and beating the soldiers. Then, flames appeared. Someone told me that an armored vehicle had been set on fire. I began to realize the seriousness of the situation and wanted to return to school, but the people around me were talking in different ways, saying that some places had already started fighting, and it was not safe on the road. I became frightened.

In desperation, I suddenly thought of going to the center of the square, where there were more students, and I wouldn't be alone and afraid. I found a place to sit down in the crowd at the northeast corner of the second layer of the monument because I was extremely tired and fell asleep, ignoring the loudspeaker broadcasts.

When an unfamiliar classmate woke me up, the soldiers had already surrounded the monument. The classmates were also preparing to withdraw, with the students on the east and south sides leaving first, followed by those on the west and north sides. I left the monument at 5:05 AM on June 4 and returned to school at 9:30 AM. I slept for more than 20 hours and only woke up at 8:30 AM the next day. Reflecting on the burned and smashed vehicles I saw on my way back to school, I began to understand what had happened in Beijing. I was very sad, as this was beyond the imagination of my naive self. After waking up, I heard the rumor of "bloodbath in Tiananmen," and I was taken aback. I told them the truth of the matter with my own experience, telling them that I didn't see a single dead person, but in the campus filled with rumors, my words had almost no effect.

Kong Xiangzhi, a teacher from the Soft Science Research Institute of Renmin University of China, also witnessed the clearing of Tiananmen Square. He said, I need to talk about the situation of the clearing of Tiananmen Square to refute the rumors of some people with ulterior motives about "blood flowing like a river in Tiananmen Square."

In the afternoon of June 3, the broadcast of the "Autonomous Council" of Renmin University kept inciting people to block military vehicles at various intersections. I was deeply afraid that the students would take some extreme actions, so around 10 PM, I rode my bike to Tiananmen Square. In Tiananmen Square, both the command post of the martial law troops and the loudspeakers of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" were broadcasting. In the broadcast of the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation," someone advocated "using violence to counter violence" and "defending the rights granted to every citizen by the constitution." I was very angry when I heard this. Isn't this pushing the students into a fire pit? So, I tried to squeeze in to find the speaker, but the patrol team stopped me. I showed my work ID, but it was no use. After a while, I finally found the tent of Renmin University, but I didn't see any familiar students. However, a few people saw that I was wearing the red school emblem of Renmin University and voluntarily came to talk to me. I told them that the government would take measures tonight and hoped they could persuade everyone to go back. But they thought it was unlikely, and one student said, "The situation on the nights of May 19 and 20 was much more serious than tonight." I told them that if the government really cleared the square, I hoped they would not "defend themselves" and quickly return to school. They agreed. Around 12:10 AM, the martial law troops came from Xichang'an Street.

At that time, I was resting on the steps of the west gate of the Great Hall of the People. When the troops came, I saw a group of people throwing stones at the troops. A few soldiers walked over, and they ran south in a panic. These few soldiers fired into the air, and later a few more soldiers came, but they did not fire at the crowd. Otherwise, I was standing by the roadside at the west gate of the Great Hall of the People, and they couldn't have missed me? After a while, I gave up the idea of going to the station to get my bike and decided to go to the square to persuade the students of Renmin University to leave.

When I walked to the intersection of the east side of the south gate of the Great Hall of the People, I saw a squad of soldiers marching from south to north, and a tank was slowly advancing. The square was already under the control of the troops, and I dared not go in. At that time, the students had gathered around the monument.

After a while, I walked towards the east gate of the Great Hall of the People. There were a few hundred soldiers resting there, and some civilians were talking to them, seemingly in a harmonious manner. I saw a person bandaging the wound of a young soldier and walked over to help, chatting with them. I asked the soldier, "How did you get injured?" He said, "It was hit by stones thrown by the crowd." He also told me that many of his comrades were injured. I saw that many soldiers around had white bandages on their heads, hands, and arms. I told this soldier that I believed most students and citizens would not do this. He also agreed with my statement. After a while, another officer came to talk to us. The officer said that the troops would never fire at the crowd and would never fire at university students.

Around 3:30 AM, the troops began to assemble, and the officer who was talking to me said: We are about to clear the square now. I announce that no one is allowed to fire at students or the crowd. Currently, this is the highest discipline!

I shook hands with the ten or so soldiers in the front row one by one, wishing them success. Just as I was about to leave, the officer came over, firmly shaking my hand and saying, "Please convey to the teachers of the school that we will definitely not fire at university students. Please rest assured!" I didn't know what to say, only saying, "Thank you! Thank you!"

Around 4:10 AM, all the lights in the square were turned off, and many soldiers came out from the east gate of the Great Hall of the People. After coming out, some rested in front of the door, and some walked north. I sat under the pine tree on the south side, watching, feeling both excited and nervous. I was nervous because I had never seen so many armed soldiers, and I didn't know how they would clear the square; I was excited because the 50-day farce was about to end, and people's nerves could relax.

Soon, the students lit a few bonfires around the monument, and the flames soared into the sky. At that time, I heard from the loudspeakers that a few people claiming to be Hou Dejian repeatedly urged the students to withdraw and expressed their willingness to negotiate with the martial law troops. Around 4:30 AM, the command post of the martial law troops broadcasted, "Students, please note that we agree with your appeal and allow you to withdraw peacefully." This was broadcasted over and over again.

Around 4:50 AM, the students around the monument began to withdraw. I looked around, and there was almost no one left, so I walked towards the students. Just as I reached the southeast corner of the square, I happened to meet the students of Renmin University withdrawing, so I returned with them. It was 5:05 AM at that time.

This is what I saw at that time, and throughout the process, I did not see a single person die. Now, a few people who fled abroad maliciously claim that "blood flowed like a river in Tiananmen Square" and that they "crawled out from a pile of corpses." This is pure nonsense. They attempt to deceive all good people in the world and defame our great socialist republic, but this is in vain because facts speak louder than words.

    “天安门广场血流成河”纯属谎言
    ——首都几位大学生和教师谈现场见闻
    新华社记者　张宝瑞　江钱峰
    北京平息反革命暴乱已整整3个月，6月4日凌晨天安门广场清场过程也已真相大白。但是，叛逃到国外的“高自联”头头吾尔开希等人，依然四处游说什么“天安门广场血流成河”、“天安门广场死亡3000人”……他们的谎言引起当时目击天安门广场清场过程的师生们的愤慨。一些师生近日向新华社记者介绍了当时清场的情况。
    清华大学原非法组织“筹委会”成员、工程物理系学生赵明对记者说，6月3日晚10时，他来到天安门广场纪念碑东侧找到了清华大学的队伍，当时听到“高自联”的大喇叭在广播，说北京许多地方出现了军队，鼓动人们去各处围堵军车。一会儿，大喇叭又广播，要学生围绕人民英雄纪念碑坐下。清华大学的队伍在纪念碑南侧二层台基上，东侧还有一面清华大学无线电系的旗帜。这时，在纪念碑周围约有两千人，广场上的人已稀稀拉拉，气氛紧张。有的学生说：“想尝尝催泪瓦斯和警棍的滋味。”有的准备“决一死战。”以后有一辆装甲车从南面沿东侧开进广场，一些人围了上去。这时，我看见有的士兵从人群那边跑来，他们被打得头破血流。我听旁边的人说，有一些零散的部队战士赤手空拳从南面进了广场，遭到一些人的殴打。晚11时左右，一些从军事博物馆来的学生说：“那边开枪了！”面临这种情况，清华大学“筹委会”的几个人临时开了一个会，提出撤退的问题，但遭到个别人反对，理由是：“我们不能当整个学生队伍的逃兵。”最后，我们提出让一个人同各校商议撤退的事情，但商议的结果分歧很大，未能形成决定。这时，我看见一个人端着一挺不知从哪里弄来的轻机枪朝“高自联”指挥部走去。在这之前能听到西边传来的枪声。戒严部队进入天安门广场后，列队排在金水桥一带，与学生队伍形成对峙状态。
      “高自联”的喇叭里传出侯德健等人的声音，他们说经过与部队谈判，同意在广场的东南角为学生和群众留出一条撤退的通道。纪念碑周围的学生和群众听了一片混乱，各种意见都有，进行表决，喊“撤离”的声音比喊“坚持”的声音大。在这中间传来几声枪响，“高自联”的喇叭被打哑了，但没有看到学生和群众死伤。
    学生和群众队伍这时徐徐朝东南方向撤去，北面戒严部队的坦克也慢慢向南开来。解放军与走在撤退队伍最后面的纠察队员之间总保持有二三十米的距离。我与一些纠察队员负责检查纪念碑以南帐篷内有无同学，检查结果没有一人。撤到最后仍有少数群众和学生不愿离开广场，于是，手拉手的纠察队员苦口婆心地劝他们离开。这时广场东南角还有200多人，其中大部分是进行劝说的纠察队员，而在数十名不愿撤离的人中，群众多于学生。相持了一段时间，一些戒严部队从毛主席纪念堂方向过来，他们高呼：“人不犯我，我不犯人！人若犯我，我必犯人！”
    不愿撤离的人一瞧这阵势都慌了，四处散逃。我从前门朝西走，一路上看到不少被烧毁的军车和其他车辆。我离开前门时已是凌晨6时15分了。
    北京服装学院8552班学生谢娟香也是6月4日凌晨从天安门广场撤退的同学。她说，6月3日晚，我和一位在清华大学读书的老同学一同出去看电影。到了东四，听人说西单那边出事了。按捺不住的好奇心，驱使我俩徒步沿长安街去西单。到西单，只见那里人山人海，呆了一会儿我们就想返校。走到天安门广场，我疲惫不堪，便在历史博物馆北面的草坪上坐了下来。
    不知过了多长时间，背后的人群忽然骚动起来，有人跑得慌里慌张，我站起来想看个究竟，但是除了人群外，什么也没看见。周围的人说，有人在追打解放军。接着，火光出现了。别人告诉我，那是点燃了装甲车。我开始意识到事情的严重，想回学校，周围的人七嘴八舌，说有些地方已经打起来了，路上不安全，我害怕起来。
    百般无奈之际，我忽然想到该到广场中心去，那里学生多，不会孤零害怕。我在纪念碑二层东北角的人堆里找个地方坐了下来，因为累极了便打起盹儿来，全不顾高音喇叭的广播。
    待不相识的同学把我推醒，士兵已包围了纪念碑。同学们也准备撤离，东面、南面的同学先走，西面、北面的同学跟在后头。我离开纪念碑的时间是6月4日凌晨5时零5分，回到学校已是9点半了。一觉睡了20多个小时，直到第二天上午八点多才起床。回想起返校途中看到那么多车辆被烧被砸的惨状，开始明白北京究竟发生了些什么事。我很难过，这绝非幼稚的我所能预见到的。起床后，便听到了“血洗天安门”的传谣，不禁一怔。我用自己的亲身经历告诉他们事情的经过，告诉他们我没看见一个死人，可是在谣言四起的校园中，我的话作用实在太小了。
    中国人民大学软科学研究所的教师孔祥智也目击了天安门广场清场的过程。他说，我有必要谈一下天安门广场清场的情况，以驳斥一些别有用心的人关于“天安门广场血流成河”的谣言。
    6月3日下午，人民大学“自治会”的广播一直鼓动人们去各路口围堵军车。我深怕学生们会采取什么过激行动，大约在晚10时左右，骑车来到了天安门广场。在天安门广场，戒严部队指挥部和“高自联”的喇叭都在广播。在“高自联”的广播中，有人鼓吹“以暴力对付暴力”，“维护宪法赋予每个公民的权利。”我听了十分气愤，这不是把学生往火坑里推吗？于是，我想挤进去找那个演说的人，但纠察队员把我拦住了，我拿出工作证也不行。过了一会儿，我好不容易找到了人大的帐篷，没有发现认识的学生，但几个人看到我戴着人大红校徽，便主动上来和我交谈。我对他们讲，今晚政府要采取措施，希望他们把大家劝回去。但他们认为可能性不大，有一个学生说：“5月19日、20日夜里的情况比今晚严峻得多。”我告诉他们，如果政府真的清场，希望他们千万不要“自卫”，要迅速返校。他们答应了。大约12点零10分，戒严部队就从西长安街开过来了。
    这时我正在人民大会堂西门的台阶上休息。部队过来时，我看到有一伙人朝部队扔石块。几个战士走过来，他们便没命地往南跑。这几个战士对着天空开了枪，后来又有几个战士走过来，但没往人群开枪，否则我站在大会堂西门的路边上，还能打不着我吗？过了一会儿，我放弃了到车站取自行车的念头，想到广场把人大的学生劝走。
    当我走到人民大会堂南门东侧路口时，看见一队解放军战士由南向北行进，一辆坦克也在徐徐开进，广场已处于部队的控制之下，我不敢进去了。这时学生已聚集在纪念碑周围。
    过了一会儿，我向人大会堂东门走去。那里有几百名解放军战士坐着休息，一些群众在和他们交谈，看来谈得很融洽。我看见一个人正在给一个小战士包扎伤口，便走过去帮忙，并与他们攀谈。我问那个战士：“你是怎么受的伤？”他说：“是群众扔石块打的。”他还告诉我，他的许多战友都受了伤。我看到四周的许多战士头上、手上、胳膊上确实包扎了白纱布。我对这位战士说，我相信大多数学生、市民是不会这么干的。他也同意我的说法。过了一会儿，又走过来一个军官与我们交谈。那个军官说，部队决不会向群众开枪，不会向大学生开枪。
    大约凌晨3时半，部队开始集合，和我谈话的那个军官说：我们马上就去清场了，我宣布，任何人都不许向学生、群众开枪，目前，这是最高纪律！
    我和站在前排的十几名战士一一握手，祝他们顺利。正准备离开时，那位军官走了过来，紧紧握着我的手说：“请你转告学校的老师们，我们是决不会向大学生开枪的，请你们放心！”我听了不知说什么好，只是说：“谢谢！谢谢！”
    约4时10分，广场上所有的灯都熄灭了，许多战士从大会堂东门走出来，出来后，有的在门前坐着休息，有的往北走，我便坐在南侧的松树下观看，心情既兴奋又紧张。紧张的是，我第一次看见这么多持枪的解放军战士，而且不知道怎样清场；兴奋的是，50天的闹剧即将结束了，人们的神经可以放松了。
    不久，学生就在纪念碑周围点燃了几堆火，火光冲天。这时从喇叭里听见，自称侯德健的几个人一遍又一遍地呼吁学生们撤离，并表示愿意和戒严部队谈判。约4时半，戒严部队指挥部广播说：“同学们请注意，我们同意你们的呼吁，允许你们和平撤离。”广播了一遍又一遍。
    约4时50分，纪念碑周围的学生开始撤离了。我看了看四周，几乎没人了，便向学生方向走去，刚来到广场东南角，恰好人大的学生撤出来，我便和他们一起回来了。当时是5时零5分。
    这就是我当时所看到的全部情况，整个过程中没有看到死亡一个人。现在逃到国外的极少数人别有用心地谎称：“天安门广场血流成河”，说什么他们是“从死尸堆里爬出来”的，这纯属无稽之谈。他们妄图欺骗世界上一切善良的人们，诋毁我们伟大的社会主义共和国，这是徒劳的，因为事实胜于雄辩。
