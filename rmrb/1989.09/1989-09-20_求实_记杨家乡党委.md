	Seeking Truth—On the Yangjia Township Party Committee

	“Only by seeking truth can one win the hearts of the people.” This is the experience gained by the Party Committee of Yangjia Township in our county through practice.

	To be frank. This spring, when this township conducted the election of village Party branches, some individuals relied on personal connections to become officials, which drew widespread complaints from the masses. For this, the township Party Committee admitted its mistake to the masses and promptly corrected it. Last spring, Jinyang Village sold 10,000 out of 12,000 kilograms of relief grain. Some township officials believed that if this matter were made public, it might provoke public outrage. The township Party Committee thought that if the ugly truth were covered up, it would lose the trust of the masses. They used the broadcast to publicly apologize to the masses and ordered Jinyang Village to buy back the sold relief grain and distribute it to the masses, thus gaining the understanding of the masses.

	To do practical work. This township has a harsh geographical environment, resulting in the strange phenomenon of “water being as precious as oil, water coming causes worry, hoping for water but hating it when it comes.” The township Party Committee led the masses to build 4 electric power stations, dig 32 wells, construct 30,000 meters of canals, excavate 4,000 meters of water channels, and dig 40,000 meters of drainage ditches, and build 94 bridges and culverts. This greatly improved the township's drought resistance and drainage capacity, and increased grain production.

	To focus on reality. When the township Party Committee and government do practical work for the masses, they pay attention to the actual situation and avoid causing losses to the masses. They organized the masses to develop the building materials industry based on the township's characteristic of having many barren lands and marshes, and built 6 large-scale rotary kiln factories. They also, based on the township's advantage of having plenty of rice straw, mobilized thousands of households to engage in straw weaving. This alone brought an annual income of 300,000 yuan to the masses of the entire township.

　　求实——记杨家乡党委
    “唯有求实，才能赢得民心。”这是我县杨家乡党委在实践中的体会。
    说实话。今年春天，这个乡进行村党支部改选时，个别人靠人情关系当上干部，群众意见纷纷。为此，乡党委向群众承认了错误，及时进行了纠正。去年春天，靳岗村把12000公斤救灾粮卖掉了10000公斤，部分乡干部认为，如果把此事公开，恐怕激起民愤。乡党委认为，倘若把丑事捂着，就会失去群众的信任。他们一面利用广播向群众公开检讨，一面责令靳岗村把卖掉的救灾粮买回来，分给群众，得到了群众的谅解。
    做实事。这个乡地理环境恶劣，出现了“水贵如油，水来发愁，盼水不来，恨水不走”的怪现象。乡党委带领群众修建4座电力排灌站，打机井32眼，修渠3万多米，开挖引水河4000多米，挖排涝沟4万多米，修桥涵94座，大大提高了抗旱排涝能力，提高了粮食生产。
    重实情。乡党委、政府为群众办实事时，注重实际情况，避免给群众造成损失。他们根据本乡荒滩洼地多的特点，组织群众发展建材业，兴建了6座大型轮窑厂；还根据本乡稻草多的优势，发动千家万户搞草编，仅此一项，全乡群众年收入达30万元。
