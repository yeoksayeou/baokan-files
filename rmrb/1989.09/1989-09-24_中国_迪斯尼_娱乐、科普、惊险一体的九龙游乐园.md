Upon arriving at this place, you might feel as if you have descended into a fairyland or are in a dream: in the dim light, you glide into the depths of the sea, where coral reefs dense as forests shimmer in various colors. A pair of mermaids smile warmly to greet the guests, while six shell fairies play flutes, sheng, and pipa, their music ethereal and enchanting. The resplendent Dragon Palace, where the Dragon King was just laughing and chatting, suddenly changes mood—disputes over the throne enrage him. In an instant, as the Dragon King sprays water, the palace is engulfed in flames and water. The fairies transform into demons...

In reality, this is a real location—the Beijing Nine Dragons Amusement Park, which is soon to be completed. It is situated in the scenic tourist area of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir in Beijing and is the first large-scale underwater amusement park in Asia that combines the characteristics of Disney and the Chinese "Legend of the Dragon."

The Nine Dragons Palace is the main attraction of the amusement park. The performance artistry of this underwater dragon palace is lifelike, utilizing advanced technologies from China, Japan, and the United States. From the central control room, a computer issues commands, and according to pre-programmed sequences, 37 lifelike robots, including mermaids, shell fairies, and the Dragon King, come to life and perform their roles automatically. The palace is enhanced with sound, light, electricity, scenery, and painting effects, giving visitors a unique sense of being in a mysterious world.

The Nine Dragons Palace is built on an island in the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir. Through a 150-meter-long underwater tunnel, you can enter the "Dragon Palace" and experience scenes that are both wondrous and thrilling.

This innovative amusement park, which combines entertainment, education, and thrills, is expected to officially welcome visitors by the end of the year.

    中国“迪斯尼”
    ——娱乐、科普、惊险一体的九龙游乐园
    到了这样一个去处，你可能恍如降临仙境，又会以为置身梦中：幽暗中你飘然潜入海底，五彩珊瑚密如丛林，一对美人鱼笑盈盈迎候来宾，六名蚌壳仙女手拿箫、笙、琵琶，仙乐悠扬。珍宝璀璨的龙宫大殿，老龙王刚刚还在谈笑风声，突然就变了脸——王位之争使龙颜大怒。在龙王喷水的瞬间，龙宫被水火吞没，仙女们纷纷变成了妖怪……
    其实，这是一个真实的场所——北京九龙游乐园，现在即将竣工。它座落在北京十三陵水库风景旅游区，是亚洲第一家既具有迪斯尼特色、又体现中国“龙的传说”的大型水下游乐场所。
    九龙宫，是游乐园的主要游览项目。这座海底龙宫的表演工艺，造型逼真，运用了中、日、美三国的高技术手段。位于中央控制室的电脑发出各项指令，按照编好的程序，包括美人鱼、蚌壳仙女、龙王等37个栩栩如生的机器人便进入“角色”，自动各显身手。龙宫配以声、光、电、景、画等艺术效果，给人一种置身神秘世界的特殊感觉。
    九龙宫建在十三陵水库中的孤岛上。通过建在水下长150米的通道，你便可进入
  “龙宫”，领略一幕幕使你乍奇乍喜乍险的场景。
    这座融娱乐、科普、惊险为一体“中西合璧”的新颖游乐园，预计年内即可正式迎接探奇者。
