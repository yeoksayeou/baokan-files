Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's postal and telecommunications industry has undergone fundamental changes. Currently, a modernized and extensive telecommunications network and postal network that connects urban and rural areas across the country has been established.

At the beginning of the liberation period, China's total capacity for urban telephone lines was only 310,000 lines, and most of the connections were manually operated. One-third of the counties in the country did not have telephone or telegraph services. By the end of June this year, the total capacity for urban telephone lines in China had increased to 5,916,000 lines, with over 90% of these lines being automatically switched. There are 3,310,000 rural telephone lines, which is a 51-fold increase compared to 1951. Currently, 95.9% of townships and 44.3% of villages have telephone services. Among all urban telephone lines, 30%, or 1,500,000 lines, are equipped with advanced program-controlled telephone switching systems that meet international standards of the 1980s.

By the end of last year, the total number of long-distance program-controlled switching systems had reached 54,276 routes, accounting for 86.9% of the total long-distance switching capacity. There are 431 cities connected to the long-distance automatic switching network, and 103 cities can directly dial 156 countries and regions around the world. Additionally, China has independently built a nationwide automatic telegraph relay network, connecting over 90% of the counties.

A three-dimensional postal transportation system centered in the capital and connecting urban and rural areas has been established. Nationwide, 99.7% of townships and 95.7% of villages have postal routes. Over the past 40 years, the total length of postal routes has increased by 6.12 times, reaching 5,030,000 kilometers. The mechanization level of mail processing has improved, and the volume of business has increased by tens of times. China can now directly communicate by mail with 124 countries and regions. International express mail services have been developed to 56 countries and regions.

    长途程控交换机去年底已达54276路端，占长话交换总数的86.9％；全国有431个城市进入长话自动交换网，103个城市可以直拨世界156个国家和地区。此外，还依靠自己的力量建设成全国电报自动转报网，连接了90％以上的县。
    一个以首都为中心、连接城乡各地的邮政运输立体体系已经形成，全国99.7％的乡和95.7％的村通了邮路。建国40年邮路总长度增长了6.12倍，达到503万公里。邮件处理的机械化程度提高，业务量数十倍地增长。我国可直接和124个国家和地区通邮，国际特快专递已发展到56个国家和地区。
