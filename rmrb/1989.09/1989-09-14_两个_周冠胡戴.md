    Two "Zhou Crowned, Hu Wears"
    Shū Wú

    In the book *Hu Shì Zhī Xiānshēng Niánpǔ Chángbiǎn Chūgǎo* (edited by Hú Sòngpíng, published by Liánjīng Publishing Company, Taipei, first edition May 1984, second printing July 1984), under the entry for September 3, 1935, there is a quote from Hu Shih's *Introduction to the Collection of Theories for Building New Chinese Literature*:

    In simple terms, my central theories have only two: (the emphasis is mine. The same below.—the quoter) One is that we need to establish a "living literature." The other is that we need to establish a "literature of the people." The former theory is about the renovation of the writing tool, and the latter is about the renovation of literary content. All the theories of the Chinese New Literature Movement can be included within this central idea.

    If a reader, who knows nothing about the history of Chinese New Literature, were to read only this passage without looking further, he would be extremely impressed by Hu Shih, thinking that the two fundamental theories of New Literature were both proposed by him alone.

    But if another reader, who has some basic knowledge of the history of Chinese New Literature, were to read only this passage, he would be very dissatisfied with Hu Shih: how could he claim the credit of Zhou Zuoren for himself? The theory of "literature of the people" was clearly proposed by Zhou Zuoren, how did it become one of Hu Shih's "central theories"?

    Let's look further. Hu Shih clearly points out:

    In December of the seventh year, *New Youth* (Volume 5, Issue 6) published Mr. Zhou Zuoren's *Literature of the People*, which was at that time the most important declaration about reforming literary content.

    What is going on here? Does Hu Shih mean that although the article was written by Zhou Zuoren, the theory was received from him, Hu Shih? If that is the case, Hu Shih is even more irresponsible, and the problem is even greater.

    We checked the original book, *Collection of Theories for Building New Chinese Literature*, and found that Hu Shih did not say "my central theories have only two." He said "our central theories have only two." The omission of the character "们" makes a world of difference.

    By "our," Hu Shih refers to the first batch of representatives of the New Literature Movement. Their theories about New Literature can indeed be summarized by the two points of "living literature" and "literature of the people." Hu Shih, as the leader of the New Literature Movement, spoke in a comprehensive and authoritative manner. *Hu Shì Zhī Xiānshēng Niánpǔ Chángbiǎn Chūgǎo* is a book rich in reference materials. Ideally, it should strive for the accuracy and reliability of the recorded materials, so that readers can trust it without needing to verify each detail. However, it has made such a significant error in omitting a single character, leading to a thousand miles of misunderstanding, which makes it difficult for readers to trust.

    The book also contains extremely absurd references. For example, in September 1918, there is an entry:

    At this time, the gentleman saw the general phenomenon of children in society and wrote a reflection (an excerpt of this reflection is quoted). Upon reading, we were greatly surprised to find that the quoted text was actually a famous essay by Lu Xun, namely, Lu Xun's first essay for *New Youth*, titled *Random Thoughts Twenty-Five*, published under the pseudonym Tang Qi. It was later included in *Hot Wind*. The excerpt in *Hu Shì Zhī Xiānshēng Niánpǔ Chángbiǎn Chūgǎo*, such as "Chinese children, as long as they are born, do not care whether they are good or bad, as long as they are many, do not care whether they are talented or not," and "Because what China has in abundance are the fathers of children, so in the future, it is only necessary to have the fathers of people," are all well-known sayings of Lu Xun. It is astonishing that they were taken as Hu Shih's works and included in Hu Shih's chronicle. As for the quoted text, it also differs greatly from *Hot Wind*, clearly due to inaccurate copying. Here, I will not list them one by one.

    两个“周冠胡戴”
    舒芜
    胡颂平编著《胡适之先生年谱长编初稿》（台北市联经出版事业公司1984年5月初版，7月第二次印行）1935年9月3日条下节引胡适《中国新文学大系建设理集导言》有云：
    简单说来，我的中心理论只有两个：　（着重点是我加的。下同。——引用者）一个是我们要建立一种“活的文学”。一个是我们要建立一种“人的文学”。前一个理论是文字工具的革新，后一种是文学内容的革新。中国新文学运动的一切理论都可以包括在这个中心思想的里面。
    如果有一位读者，对中国新文学史毫无所知，又单单看了这段话，不看下文，他会对胡适佩服至极，因为新文学的两条基本理论，全是他一人提出来的。
    但如果另一位读者，他略知中国新文学史的常识，他单单看了这段话，就会对胡适大为不满：怎么居然攘周作人之功为己有呢？”“人的文学”的理论，明明是周作人提出来的，怎么变成胡适的“我的中心理论只有两个”之一呢？再看下去，胡适原来明确指出：
    七年十二月里，《新青年》（五卷六号）发表周作人先生的《人的文学》，这是当时关于改革文学内容的一篇最重要的宣言。　　
    这又是怎么一回事呢？难道胡适的意思是，文章虽是周作人写的，理论却是受之于他胡适的么？如果是这样的话，胡适更是信口开河，更成问题了。
    我们找出《中国新文学大系·建设理论集》来校一校，原来胡适并未说过“我的中心理论只有两个”，他说的是“我们的中心理论只有两个”，漏去一个“们”字，可就大差其远了。
    胡适所谓“我们”，是指新文学运动的第一批代表人物们，他们关于新文学的理论，的确可以“活的文学”和“人的文学”两条概括之，胡适是以新文学运动的主将，统览全局的口气那样说的。《胡适之先生年谱长编初稿》是一部资料性很强的书，照理应该力求所录材料精确可靠，使读者可以放心，无须一一再去检对原书，现在却弄出这样一字之差，千里之谬的校对错误来，便令读者很难放心了。
    此书引录材料，还有非常荒唐的。例如，1918年9月，有一则云：
    此时先生看了社会上一般孩子的现象，写了一篇感想（摘要引录了这篇感想）。我们一读，大吃一惊，原来所引录的竟是鲁迅的一篇名文，即是鲁迅第一次为《新青年》写的随感录，题为《随感录二十五》，发表时署名唐俟，后来收在《热风》里面。《胡适之先生年谱长编初稿》中所摘录的，例如“中国的孩子，只要生，不管他好不好，只要多，不管他才不才”，又如“因为我们中国所多的是孩子之父，所以以后是只要人之父”，这些都是早已脍灸人口的鲁迅名言，不知何以竟被当作胡适的作品，引录在胡适的年谱里面，真是可怪！至于引录的文字，又多与《热风》不同，显系出于不准确的抄写，这里就不一一列举了。
