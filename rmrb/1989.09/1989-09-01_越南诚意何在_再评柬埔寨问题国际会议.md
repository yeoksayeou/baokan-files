The Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue failed to reach any agreement and was forced to adjourn temporarily. Vietnam's lack of sincerity and its insistence on a rigid stance are the fundamental reasons for the failure of this conference to achieve substantive progress.

The purpose of this Paris conference was to achieve two basic goals: first, to establish an effective international monitoring mechanism under the auspices of the United Nations to oversee Vietnam's genuine and complete withdrawal of troops; second, after Vietnam's genuine withdrawal, to form a transitional four-party coalition government led by Sihanouk during the transitional period to ensure domestic peace in Cambodia and prevent civil war. However, on these two fundamental issues, Vietnam's position is in sharp contrast with that of the majority of the participating countries.

Let's take a look at how Vietnam has been acting!

Vietnam raised the so-called "genocide" issue. During the conference, Vietnam insisted on including the term "genocide" in the draft documents, causing the drafting work to repeatedly stall. "Genocide" is a matter of international law, and using it arbitrarily in an international conference is highly irresponsible. Despite many delegates' logical refutations and suggestions for alternative terms, Vietnam remained unyielding. What is the purpose of this? As Prince Norodom Sihanouk put it, Vietnam's intention is to shift the focus of the conference and cover up its aggression. Even after being forced to decide on a withdrawal, Vietnam is still fabricating reasons for its invasion of Cambodia, disrupting the peace process in Cambodia.

Insisting on "excluding the Khmer Rouge." To counter the proposal by the three resistance factions in Cambodia, which was supported by many participating countries, to establish a transitional four-party coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk, Vietnam, in collusion with the Phnom Penh regime, vigorously promoted a plan for a coalition government that excludes the Khmer Rouge. Despite this plan being firmly rejected by many participating countries and the three factions of the Democratic Kampuchea, Vietnam remained obstinate, making negotiations difficult. Vietnam's insistence on this unjust and impractical demand ultimately stems from its desire to gain through this international conference what it could not achieve on the battlefield over the past 10 years. It cannot be denied that the Khmer Rouge made mistakes in the past, but it remains an important force in resisting Vietnamese aggression and is part of the legitimate Cambodian government recognized by the United Nations. If the future government does not include the Khmer Rouge, it will not only be unjust but also impossible to achieve domestic peace. Vietnam's rigid stance on this issue only shows its lack of sincerity in seeking a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable solution to the Cambodian issue.

Insisting on the "theory that the United Nations has no right to supervision." In the historical and national realities between Vietnam and Cambodia, Vietnam's withdrawal of troops urgently needs a practical and effective international monitoring mechanism. This is a very straightforward point. However, Vietnam ignores reality and, using the United Nations' non-recognition of the Phnom Penh regime as an excuse, stubbornly refuses to allow a reputable and capable United Nations to perform its supervisory duties. This action makes people doubt whether Vietnam will genuinely withdraw its troops.

During the conference, Hun Sen boasted extensively about Phnom Penh's inevitable victory in the elections and the continued strength of the Phnom Penh military after Vietnam's withdrawal. He even threatened that even if a second Afghanistan were to appear, he would not be afraid. In Hun Sen's view, not negotiating and not reconciling is more advantageous for the Phnom Penh regime. Hun Sen's confidence and his extravagant demands in the negotiations are inseparable from Vietnam's rigid stance.

From this, it is clear that Vietnam has shown no sincerity in the Paris conference on the political settlement of the Cambodian issue. Its so-called agreement to a "comprehensive solution" is, in essence, to make its withdrawal of troops a mere formality, to ensure that the future Cambodian government is controlled by Hun Sen, and to achieve its goal of continuing to control Cambodia. Vietnam's intentions have been increasingly exposed to more and more people.

    越南诚意何在
    ——再评柬埔寨问题国际会议
    本报记者　张启华　吕网大
    关于柬埔寨问题的巴黎国际会议没有达成任何协议，被迫暂时休会。越南缺乏诚意和坚持僵硬立场，是导致这次会议未能取得实质性进展的根本原因。
    这次巴黎会议旨在实现两个基本目标：一是建立由联合国主持的有效的国际监督机构，监督越南真正、全部撤军；二是在越南真正撤军后，在过渡时期成立以西哈努克为首的四方临时联合政府，以保证柬埔寨国内和平，避免内战。然而，在这两个基本问题上，越南所持主张与大多数与会国的立场严重对立。
    人们不妨看看越南是如何动作的！
    提出所谓“种族灭绝”问题。会议期间，越南在许多场合，特别是在起草文件的过程中，坚持要把“种族灭绝”一词塞进文件，致使起草工作一再陷入僵局。“种族灭绝”涉及国际法，在国际会议上随意套用是很不严肃的。尽管许多与会代表据理驳斥，有人还提出了替代名词，但都无法改变越南的主意。这究竟为了什么呢？用拉那烈王子的话来说，越南的用意是转移会议目标和掩盖其侵略行径。越南在被迫作出撤军的决定后，仍然在为自己编造入侵柬埔寨“有理”的根据，破坏柬埔寨的和平进程。
    坚持“排除红色高棉”。为了对抗柬埔寨抵抗运动三方提出的、并得到许多与会国家支持的建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府的建议，越南伙同金边政权竭力兜售一项排除“红色高棉”的联合政府方案。尽管这一方案遭到许多与会国和民柬三方的断然拒绝，但越南仍顽固坚持，使谈判难以进行。越南所以顽固坚持这种既不公正又不现实的要求，说到底，是它想通过这次国际会议得到过去10年战场上没能得到的东西。不可否认，红色高棉在过去犯过错误，但它毕竟是抵抗越南侵略的一支重要力量，又是得到联合国承认的合法柬埔寨政府的一部分，未来政府如果没有红色高棉参加，不仅是不公正的，而且也不可能实现国内和平。越南在这个问题上持僵硬态度，只能表明它对全面、公正、合理解决柬埔寨问题没有诚意。
    坚持“联合国无权监督论”。在越南、柬埔寨之间的历史、民族的现实条件下，越南撤军，非常需要有一个切实有效的国际监督机构，这是一个十分浅显的道理。但越南却无视现实，以联合国不承认金边政权为借口，顽固拒绝有威望、有能力的联合国行使监督任务。它这样做，使人们对它是否真正撤军不能不表示怀疑。
    会议期间，洪森大肆吹嘘金边。在大选中必胜，越南撤军后金边军队依然十分强大。他甚至威胁说，即使出现第二个阿富汗也不怕。在洪森看来，不谈判、不和解，对金边政权更为有利。洪森如此有恃无恐，以及在谈判中漫天要价，是同越南的僵硬态度分不开的。
    由此可见，在政治解决柬埔寨问题的巴黎会议上，越南毫无诚意可言。它的所谓赞同“全面解决”，说穿了就是使它的撤军有名无实，使未来的柬埔寨政府由洪森一家掌权，以达到它继续控制柬埔寨的目的。越南的这一意图，已为越来越多的人所看清。
