The director of a certain oil depot in the Jinan Military Region, Li Xuren (second from the left), has overseen the completion of more than 500 ten-thousand yuan worth of construction projects in the past six years. He has not accepted any bribes from the construction units, and there are at least 15 documented instances where he refused bribes totaling nearly ten thousand yuan. He is known among the soldiers as a "trustworthy good director."
