The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China has decided, and with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to expel Tuohuti Shabier from the Party.

The decision states that Tuohuti Shabier, a member of the Party Group of the People's Government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and a member of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, abused his power, supported others in speculation, and accepted bribes totaling more than 16,000 yuan. Moreover, his moral integrity is severely compromised, using his position to engage in improper sexual relationships, completely losing the qualifications to be a member of the Communist Party.

    新华社北京9月7日电　中共中央纪律检查委员会决定，并经中共中央批准，给予托乎提·沙比尔同志开除党籍处分。
    决定说，新疆维吾尔自治区人民政府党组成员、自治区党委委员托乎提·沙比尔滥用职权，支持他人投机倒把，收受贿赂达16000余元，且道德败坏，利用职权搞不正当两性关系，完全丧失了作为共产党员的条件。
