George Hatem's seventy-eight years of life were extraordinary, far beyond what one could imagine. He was born as George Hatem and died as Ma Haide. He was born an American and died a Chinese. He was born into a poor family in the eastern United States and died having achieved remarkable success under the banner of communism.

In 1936, Hatem made the decision to "go to the other side of the river." He went to the besieged area where Mao Zedong led the Communists. This was a daring move for a twenty-six-year-old, fraught with risks to his life and personal reputation, as well as his family's honor. The chances of survival were slim. But with the enthusiasm and energy of a young man, he threw himself into the fray and was soon deeply moved by the fervor and sense of mission of the survivors of the Long March under Mao's leadership.

From 1949 to 1971, American news media blocked information about Hatem, and he was unknown to the outside world. As early as 1936, he had specifically requested that Edgar Snow remove all mentions of him from his book "Red Star Over China."

Students, people from various professions, writers, and actors began to sneak past the Kuomintang blockade to reach Yan'an. The cave dwellings of Yan'an were a place of extraordinary life, first fighting against Chiang Kai-shek, then against the Japanese, and then again against Chiang Kai-shek. Hatem, as a doctor, was always busy, but at the same time, he was busy becoming a Chinese. He learned Chinese and chose a Chinese surname—Ma. Because many Hui people in China have the surname Ma, and he felt that due to his Lebanese heritage, he had an Arab kinship with the Hui people. He also married a beautiful Chinese actress.

In 1950, due to his twelve years of life in Yan'an, he became the first foreigner to obtain Chinese citizenship in New China.

At that time, his father had immigrated from Lebanon to North Carolina, USA. George studied at the University of North Carolina for two years before embarking on a series of actions.

He returned to his Lebanese roots from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, riding a bicycle across Europe to Switzerland. George also went to the most exciting, dangerous, and intrigue-filled metropolis in the world, Shanghai.

The boy from Buffalo City became a venereal disease expert in the Shanghai concession, finding his career. The old China, exhausted by foreign invasions, civil war, warlords, and opium, also bore the additional burden of rampant venereal diseases.

When peace came under the leadership of the Communist Party, he helped the government organize and implement a massive public health campaign, and by the 1970s, various venereal diseases had been eradicated from the population. Hatem's great achievement in eradicating venereal diseases was the most meaningful work of his life.

In the latter part of his life, he turned to the work of eradicating leprosy and launched a large-scale, planned campaign to eradicate the disease. Despite being plagued by illness, he worked tirelessly. Pancreatic surgery and radiation therapy left him with diabetes and enzyme deficiency. Lung lesions proved he had metastatic prostate cancer. But he continued to work and attended an international conference on leprosy, receiving the Damien Dutton Award, the Lasker Award, and honorary degrees from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of Buffalo. He also served as the president of the Chinese Leprosy Association.

In July 1988, he was discharged from the hospital and attended the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War conference in Toronto. He was aware that his days were numbered. He then slowly drove from Buffalo to Chapel Hill to enjoy his homeland once more. He went to Kansas City, and everyone he met knew this was his farewell journey. Upon returning to Beijing, he was immediately hospitalized and finally succumbed to hepatic coma.

Without acknowledging his growth throughout his life, one cannot fully tell his story. He absorbed the finest virtues of the Chinese people while retaining the essence of an American, becoming a person of profound insight, humility, and kindness.

An American who crossed the river's obstacle, gave up his nationality, and became a Marxist, he was such a distinguished figure that even the most die-hard American reactionaries could not deny George Hatem's life.

George Hatem's ultimate enlightenment to people is: as long as one fully dedicates oneself to humanity, it does not matter whether one's talent comes from this side or that side of the river.

    乔治·海德在大河彼岸去世
    （美国）　格雷·戴蒙德医学博士
    他七十八年的一生十分伟大，远远超出人们的想象力。他生为乔治·海德，死时是马海德。他生为美国人，死时是中国人。他生在美国东部的一个贫寒家庭，死时，已在共产主义旗帜下取得杰出的成就。
    一九三六年，海德做了“到大河彼岸”去的决定，他到了被围困的毛泽东领导下的共产党人那里。这是一个年仅二十六岁青年所采取的举动，无论从哪个角度来判断，这都是一个冒着生命危险、担着对个人名誉和家庭名声的风险的举动。幸存的希望是微小的。但他以一个年青人的喜悦和精力投身其中，很快他就被毛泽东领导下的长征幸存者的满腔热情和使命感所深深吸引。
    从一九四九年到一九七一年，美国新闻报刊封锁消息，海德其人不为外界所知。早在一九三六年，他本人还特意明确地请埃德加·斯诺在报道中国共产党人的《西行漫记》中把提到海德之处一一删去。
    大学生、各行各业的人、作家、演员开始偷偷通过国民党的封锁来到延安。延安窑洞的生活是不平凡的十二年，先与蒋介石打仗，接着抗日，随后又是和蒋介石打，海德作为一个医生，一直十分忙碌，但与此同时他也忙于变做一个中国人。他学中文，并选了一个中国人的姓——马，因为中国回族人多姓马，而他感到由于他的黎巴嫩血统，他和回族人民有一种阿拉伯的亲属关系，他还娶了一个漂亮的中国演员。
    一九五○年，由于他在延安的十二年生活经历，他成为新中国第一个获得中国国籍的外国人。
    当年，他的父亲是从黎巴嫩移民到美国北卡罗来纳州的。乔治在北卡罗来纳大学学习了两年后，便开始了一系列行动。
    他从北卡罗来纳大学教堂山回归到他的黎巴嫩的根，他骑着自行车横越欧洲到了瑞士，乔治还到过世界上最令人兴奋、最危险而又最充满阴谋诡计的大都市上海。
    这个来自布法罗城的男童成了上海租界的一名性病专家，他找到了自己的事业。由于外国的侵略、内战、军阀和鸦片而丧尽元气的旧中国，还背着性病猖獗的额外的包袱。
    当在共产党领导下迎来和平时，他帮助政府组织并推行了一项巨大的公共卫生事业，到二十世纪七十年代，已从众多人口中消灭了各种性病。海德为消灭性病而取得的巨大成就是他一生中最有意义的工作。
    在他生命的最后岁月里，他转向根除麻风病的工作，并发起一个大规模的、有计划的消灭麻风病的运动。尽管他已被病魔缠身，但仍孜孜不倦地工作。胰腺手术和放射治疗给他留下了糖尿病和酶缺乏症。肺部的病变证明他患了转移性前列腺癌。但他继续工作，并参加了研讨麻风病的国际会议，接受了达米安麻风病奖、拉斯克奖和密苏里·堪萨斯市大学及布法罗大学的名誉学位，他还担任中国麻风病协会会长一职。
    一九八八年七月，他出院，出席在多伦多召开的国际医学界防止核战争会议。他已意识到自己来日无多，随后他拖着消瘦之躯乘车缓慢地从布法罗到教堂山，要再欣赏一下他的祖国。他来到堪萨斯城，所见到的每一个人都明白他此行是来告别。一回到北京，他即被送进医院，最后出现肝昏迷而溘然长逝。如果不承认他一生的成长经历，
  就无法完整讲述他的一生。他汲取了中国人最优秀的美德，同时又
  保留了一个美国人的本色，成为一个有真知灼见、谦逊体贴和蔼的
  人。
      一个美国人跨越大河的障碍，放弃了自己的国籍，成为一个马克思主义者，他是这样一个功勋卓著的人，甚至连最顽固不化的美国反动派也不能不承认乔治·海德的一生。
    乔治·海德一生给人的终极启迪是：一个人只要完全地贡献于人类，便不在乎天资是来自大河此岸还是彼岸。
