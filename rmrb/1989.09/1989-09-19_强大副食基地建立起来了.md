A Powerful Subsidiary Food Base Has Been Established

Over the past 40 years, agriculture in the suburbs of Beijing, along with other sectors, has undergone tremendous changes. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the 16,000-plus square kilometers of fields in the suburbs of Beijing have seen continuous grain harvests for 11 years. The total and per-unit yields have surpassed historical highs for three consecutive years. This is the bountiful result achieved by nearly 4 million farmers in the suburbs of Beijing under the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to the socialist path, and continuously deepening reforms. The most fundamental sign of change is that the self-sufficient, semi-self-sufficient small peasant economy has transformed into a large-scale commodity economy, and a stable subsidiary food base serving the capital has been established. Traditional manual agricultural labor is gradually transitioning into a socialized, specialized, and commoditized sector, and socialist modern agriculture with Chinese characteristics is showing signs of life. Agriculture in the suburbs of Beijing is full of vitality, and the once impoverished broad masses of farmers have shifted from pursuing basic sustenance to striving for a moderately prosperous society!

Serving the Capital, Enriching Farmers

Stabilizing the Development of the Subsidiary Food Production Base

According to records, in 1949, the suburbs of Beijing had 65,000 mu of vegetable fields, producing 105 million jin of vegetables annually. Each citizen consumed only about 3 jin per day, mainly cabbage and radishes. As for meat and eggs, there was very little.

After the founding of New China, vegetable fields in the inner suburbs such as Chaoyang, Haidian, and Fengtai developed rapidly. By around 1957, several outer suburbs were incorporated, and supplying the capital with meat, eggs, milk, and fruits became the primary task of the farmers. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government clearly proposed the goal of "serving the capital and enriching the farmers," aiming to build the suburbs into a subsidiary food production base. By implementing the policy of "state-owned, collective, and individual" development, vegetable, meat, egg, milk, fish, fruit, and poultry production bases rapidly emerged in the suburbs. Especially with the use of modern production methods in state-owned and collective poultry and pig farms, market stability was ensured. Compared to the early days of liberation, the difference is enormous. Even compared to 1988 with 1978, vegetables increased by 65%; commercial eggs increased by 9.2 times; milk increased by 2.3 times; freshwater fish increased by 20.7 times; dried and fresh fruits increased by 35.7%; and watermelons increased by 10 times. The "vegetable basket" of the capital's people is indeed becoming more abundant.

Deepening Reforms, Promoting Scale Operations

Grain Production Does Not Stall, Harvesting for Eleven Years

While focusing on the production of subsidiary foods, various levels of leadership in Beijing have never relaxed their efforts on grain production. Although urban construction and subsidiary food production have reduced the area of grain fields in the suburbs year by year, Beijing's total grain production has steadily increased. In 1988, the total grain production was 5.6 times that of 1949, and the per-unit yield was more than 8 times that of then.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the suburbs of Beijing implemented the household contract responsibility system, and agricultural production initially saw rapid growth. With the development of the socialist commodity economy in rural areas, a large number of farmers turned to township enterprises and subsidiary food production. The original operating methods could no longer meet the requirements of agricultural production development, leading to extensive cultivation, soil degradation, and slow production growth. At the same time, the relatively complete agricultural infrastructure, agricultural machinery, and technical systems accumulated over the years also found it difficult to fully play their roles. To prevent agricultural decline and ensure sustained increases in production, Beijing has adhered to practical principles and, since 1985, has begun to change the pattern of average and scattered land contracts. In developed plain areas, it has gradually promoted agricultural scale operations with the goals of specialization, commoditization, and modernization, concentrating scattered land relatively, and having specialized teams and households contract and operate grain production on a scale. As of now, 2,568 villages in the plain grain areas have implemented land scale operations, accounting for 91.6% of the total number of plain villages, with a scale-operated grain field area of 2.344 million mu, accounting for 68.2% of the total.

Implementing scale operations has promoted the rural economy into a new virtuous cycle, accelerating the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture. Grain production in the suburbs quickly regained its vitality, with the per-unit yield reaching 520 jin in 1988, the first time it exceeded "1,000 jin," and the total production reaching 2.345 billion jin, an increase of 3.4% over the previous year.

First, Invest; Second, Science and Technology

Modern New-Type Agriculture

Showing Signs of Life

In terms of increasing agricultural investment, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have paid attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of both farmers and the government. In 1986, the city formulated a plan to "build a 3-million-mu grain base in two batches." By the end of 1988, the municipal, county, and township levels had invested 197 million yuan to purchase agricultural machinery, develop agricultural water conservancy, and promote technological progress. Taking agricultural machinery as an example, in 1988, the suburbs had 12,596 large and medium-sized tractors, an increase of 1.3 times compared to 1978; the total agricultural machinery power reached 5.434 million horsepower, an increase of 1.1 times compared to 1978.

Three years ago, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government clearly proposed that grain production should rely on science and technology, focusing on increasing per-unit yield. Now, the mechanized comprehensive technology series for wheat and corn has been promoted to 2 million mu; the comprehensive water-saving technology centered on canal lining, pipeline irrigation, and sprinkler irrigation has been promoted to 340,000 mu; the double-cropping index and land utilization rate have been improved, with the flat-seeding area for wheat and corn reaching 1.7 million mu; the fifth generation of wheat varieties has been completed in the suburbs; airplane pest control and chemical herbicides have become increasingly popular...

The construction of the capital's subsidiary food base has also provided a broad stage for the application of modern science and technology. The city now has 901 mechanized and semi-mechanized state-owned and collective poultry farms, established 20 county-level pig breeding farms, popularized artificial insemination with frozen semen in dairy cow production, and electronic computer management is being used in 10 large-scale standardized cattle farms; the fast, labor-saving, drug-saving, energy-saving, and effective pipeline spraying technology has been promoted to 14 counties and districts, controlling an orchard area of 18,000 mu; according to the municipal government's plan, a number of high-yield, stable-yield, low-consumption, high-efficiency modern vegetable fields have been and are being built.

专栏：社会主义事业在前进

　　强大副食基地建立起来了
    40年来，京郊农业和其它各项事业一样，发生了巨大的变化。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，在京郊16000余平方公里的田野上，已经连续11年获得粮食丰收，总产、单产连续3年双超历史最高水平。这是京郊近400万农民在共产党领导下，坚持社会主义道路，不断深化改革，取得的丰硕成果。变化的最根本标志是，自给半自给的小农经济实现了向大规模商品经济的转化，为首都服务的稳固的副食品基地已经建立；传统的手工劳动的农业正逐步跨入社会化、专业化、商品化的行列，具有中国特色的社会主义现代化农业已显露生机；京郊农业充满了生机与活力，摆脱了贫困的广大农民群众，由过去的追求温饱变为朝小康水平奋勇前进了！
        服务首都　富裕农民
    稳定发展副食品生产基地
    据资料记载，1949年京郊有菜田6.5万亩，全年产菜1.05亿公斤。市民每人每天不过3两，而且主要是白菜、萝卜。至于肉、蛋，更是少得可怜。
    新中国成立以后，朝阳、海淀、丰台等近郊区菜田迅速发展。1957年前后，陆续划入一批远郊县，供应首都肉、蛋、奶、果等副食品成为农民的主要任务。党的十一届三中全会以后，市委、市政府明确提出了“服务首都，富裕农民”，把京郊建设成为副食品生产基地的目标。通过实行“国营、集体、个人”一齐上的方针，菜、肉、蛋、奶、鱼、果、禽等生产基地在京郊迅速崛起。特别是采用现代化生产手段的国营集体养鸡、养猪场，保证了市场稳定。拿现在同解放初对比，相差十分悬殊。就是拿1988年同1978年相比，蔬菜也增长了65％；商品蛋增长了9.2倍；牛奶增长了2.3倍；淡水鱼增长了20.7倍；干鲜果品增长了35.7％，西瓜增长了10倍。首都人民的“菜篮子”，着实是越来越丰盛了。
    深化改革　推行规模经营
    粮食不徘徊　丰收十一年
    北京市在抓好副食品生产的同时，各级领导干部对粮食生产一直没有放松。尽管城市建设征地和副食品生产占地，使京郊粮田面积逐年减少，但是北京市的粮食总产量始终在稳步增长，1988年粮食总产相当于1949年的5.6倍，亩产相当于那时的8倍多。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，京郊农村实行家庭联产承包责任制，农业生产一度增长很快。随着农村社会主义商品经济的发展，一大批农民转入了乡镇企业和副食品生产，原有的经营方式已经不能适应农业生产发展的要求，农业出现耕作粗放、地力下降现象，生产发展缓慢。同时，多年积累起来的比较完备的农田基础设施和农业机械、技术系统，也难以充分发挥作用。为了防止农业萎缩，保证持续增产，北京市坚持从实际出发，从1985年开始改变土地平均分散承包的格局，在平原发达地区逐步推行以专业化、商品化、现代化为目标的农业适度规模经营，把分散的土地相对集中起来，由专业队、专业户承包，实行粮食专业生产，土地适度规模经营。截至目前，平原粮区实行土地规模经营的村有2568个，占平原村总数的91.6％，规模经营的粮田面积234.4万亩，占总数的68.2％。
    实行适度规模经营，促进了农村经济步入新的良性循环，加速了传统农业向现代农业转化。京郊粮食生产很快恢复了生机，1988年亩产首次突破“千斤”，达到520公斤，总产达到23.45亿公斤，比上一年增长了3.4％。一靠投入　二靠科技
  现代化新型农业
  显　露　生　机
    在增加农业投入方面，市委、市政府注意发挥农民和政府的两个积极性。1986年，市里制定了一个“建设300万亩粮食基地分两批实施”的规划，截至1988年底，市、县、乡三级已投资1.97亿元，用于购置农机具、兴修农田水利和科技进步。仅以农业机械为例，1988年，京郊共拥有大中型拖拉机12596台，比1978年增加了1.3倍；农机总功率达543.4万马力，比1978年增加了1.1倍。
    3年前，市委、市政府明确提出了粮食生产要依靠科技，主攻单产的目标。如今，小麦、玉米的农机系列化综合技术已推广200万亩；以渠道衬砌、管道灌溉和喷灌为中心的农业综合节水技术推广到34万亩；提高复种指数和土地利用率的小麦、玉米两茬平播面积发展到170万亩；小麦良种在京郊已完成第5次更新换代；飞机防治病虫、化学药剂除草越来越普及……
    首都副食品基地的建设，也为现代科技的应用提供了广阔天地。全市已有机械化、半机械化的国营、集体养鸡场901个，建起了20个县区级良种猪繁殖场，奶牛生产中普及了冷冻精液人工配种，电子计算机管理正在10个大型规范化牛场中使用；快速、省工、省药、节能、效果明显的管道喷药新技术，已推广到14个县区，控制果林面积达1.8万亩；按市政府规划，一批高产、稳产、低耗、高效益的现代化菜田已经并正在建设起来。　（王永华）
