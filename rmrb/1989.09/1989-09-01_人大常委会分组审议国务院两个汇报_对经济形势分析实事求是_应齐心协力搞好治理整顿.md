Members attending the ninth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee today discussed in groups the reports by Vice Premier Yao Yilin on the implementation of the 1989 national economic and social development plan and by State Councilor and Minister of Finance Wang Baoqing on the implementation of the 1989 national budget. They pointed out that the two reports provide a realistic analysis of the current economic situation. In the face of the severe situation, the people of the entire country should unite as one, work together, and strive hard through rectification and reform to further improve the country's economic situation.

Mo Wenxiang, a member, said that the State Council's report is realistic and reflects the problems in the current economic situation. Using the spirit of this report to unify the thoughts of cadres and the masses can inspire people to strive for self-improvement and overcome difficulties.

Yang Lieyu, a member, believes that the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee should call on local people's congresses and their standing committees and local governments at all levels to support and assist the State Council in further implementing the central government's directives on economic work, establish the authority of the State Council, and ensure that orders are carried out and prohibitions are observed.

Gao Xiu, a member, suggested strengthening education on the situation to make the people, especially cadres at the county level and above, clearly recognize the severity of the situation and genuinely tighten their belts for a few years to carry out rectification and reform.

Li Xuezhi, a member, pointed out that some mistakes in economic work are inseparable from the errors of Zhao Ziyang. However, the reason why his errors were not corrected in time is that there was a lack of supervision within and outside the party.

Zhang Youjun, a member, said that after listening to the State Council's report, he felt that the State Council has done a lot of work in rectification and reform and deepening reforms, and the national economic situation is improving. This is the result of the joint efforts of the entire country.

Zhang Ke, a member, emphasized that although there are difficulties in reducing fixed assets, we must not relax. The use of foreign capital over the past few years should be seriously checked and analyzed, as some of it has been used for the production of luxury goods.

Wang Houde, a member, believes that we should regard hard work, self-reliance, striving for self-improvement, and thrift as a basic policy, rather than as a temporary measure in the face of current severe financial difficulties.

Yang Lifeng, a member, believes that although this year's grain harvest is good, it should not be overestimated. The increase in production is a recovery, and the stagnant situation in agriculture has not been broken through. The imbalance between industry and agriculture has not changed. To achieve the strategic development goals of agriculture, we must increase investment in agricultural infrastructure, increase investment in intelligence and agricultural technology, and genuinely enhance farmers' enthusiasm for farming, truly placing agriculture in the first position.

    人大常委会分组审议国务院两个汇报
    对经济形势分析实事求是应齐心协力搞好治理整顿
    据新华社北京9月1日电  出席七届全国人大常委会第九次会议的委员今天在分组审议姚依林副总理作的关于1989年国民经济和社会发展计划的执行情况的汇报和国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾作的关于1989年国家预算执行情况的汇报时指出，这两个汇报对当前经济形势的分析是实事求是的。在严峻的形势面前，全国人民应当团结一致，齐心协力，艰苦奋斗，通过搞好治理整顿，使我国的经济状况进一步好转。
    莫文祥委员说，国务院的汇报所谈问题比较实在，反映了当前经济形势中的问题。用这个汇报精神统一广大干部、群众的思想，可以激发人们发愤图强、克服困难的信心。
    杨烈宇委员认为，全国人大及其常委会要号召各级人大及其常委会和各级地方政府，支持帮助国务院进一步贯彻执行中央关于经济工作中的指示，树立国务院的权威，做到有令必行，有禁必止。
    高修委员建议，要加强形势教育，使全国人民特别是县以上干部都清醒地认清形势的严峻性，真心实意地过几年紧日子，搞好治理整顿。
    李学智委员指出，经济工作中出现的一些失误同赵紫阳同志的错误是分不开的，但他的错误为什么没能及时纠正，原因之一就是失去了党内外的监督。
    张有隽委员说，听了国务院的汇报，觉得国务院在治理整顿和深化改革中做了很多工作，国家经济形势正在好转，这是全国上下共同努力奋斗的结果。
    张忱委员强调，压缩固定资产虽有困难，但还是不能松口。对这几年已经利用的外资情况应认真检查一下，好好分析总结，有些外资被用于奢侈品生产。
    王厚德委员认为，应把艰苦奋斗，自力更生，发愤图强，勤俭建国作为基本国策，而不应作为在当前财政面临严重困难情况下的一种权宜之计。
    杨立功委员认为，今年农业粮食收成较好，但不能估价过高。增产是恢复性的，农业徘徊局面并没有突破，工农业比例失调状况并没有改变。要实现农业战略发展目标，必须增加农田基本建设，增加智力和农业技术投资，切实提高农民务农的积极性，把农业真正摆在首位。
