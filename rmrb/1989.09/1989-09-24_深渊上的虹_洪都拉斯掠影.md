**The Rainbow Over the Abyss**

**A Glimpse of Honduras**

**The "Silver Mountain"**

Tegucigalpa is nestled in a lush valley. Following the winding road and crossing the Choluteca River, one enters the bustling city area. At that time, it had just rained and cleared, and a rainbow arched majestically over the dark mountains, appearing particularly magnificent. Legend has it that in the 17th century, when the Spanish arrived in this unfamiliar place, the local indigenous people, adorned with beautiful silver ornaments, told them, "This is Tegucigalpa (meaning 'silver mountain')." Today, although Tegucigalpa is no longer famous for its silver mines, it remains rich in pastoral colors: green mountains, clear waters, and the faint mist in the morning and evening, drifting lazily.

Originally, I had bought a ticket to fly from Mexico City to Tegucigalpa and then to San Pedro Sula on the same day. However, upon arriving at the airport in Tegucigalpa, I learned that due to a lack of fuel, domestic flights had been suspended for two days. The airport staff explained, "Without Texaco and Esso (American oil companies), our 'Sasa' (Honduran Airlines) can't operate." Later, as I learned more about this country, I discovered that without "Texaco and Esso," it wasn't just "Sasa" that couldn't operate. The Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, Dario, frankly told me, "Our economy is underdeveloped and still dependent." "If the dollar sneezes, our Lempira (Honduran currency) will catch a cold." In the 1920s, American monopolistic capital entered Honduras, turning this resource-rich country into an American banana plantation. Because banana exports once ranked first in the world, Honduras was also known as the "Banana Republic." Even now, Honduras remains an agricultural country, primarily producing bananas, coffee, and other economic crops. Bananas account for 70% of agricultural output and 39% of total exports, but this vast banana resource is still controlled by the United Fruit Company. In the northern plains, from San Pedro Sula to Tela, one can see many contiguous banana and oil palm plantations. Locals say that these are owned by the "Standard" (United Fruit Company).

To gradually break away from a single economic structure and develop the national economy, Honduras has made great efforts and undergone a tortuous development. Initially, it attempted to implement an "import substitution" strategy to reduce dependence on foreign economies. In recent years, Honduras has also established free trade zones and customer industries, attracting foreign investment and technology. Now, Honduras has gradually established some textile, food, tobacco, sugar, coffee, and other agricultural product processing industries, expanding the production and export of non-traditional products. In 1988 alone, the export of non-traditional products increased by 12%. However, in Honduras, the most marketable agricultural industry is still monopolized and controlled by foreign capital. In short, the entire country of Honduras is like the "Silver Mountain" Tegucigalpa, both changing with development and deeply marked by the past era.

**The Forest Sea**

Traveling in Honduras, one rarely sees exposed land. An official from the National Resources Department said that 70% of Honduras' territory is covered by wild plants; the forest area accounts for 60% of the entire territory, truly a "forest country." Due to the sparse population and few accessible roads, most forests remain in their original state. An ecologist told me that the number of animal and plant resources in Honduras' forests is still unknown.

I went to the northern coastal town of Lancetilla and the Tigra Nature Reserve near Tegucigalpa. It's just a few dozen kilometers from the city, and already it's a vast tropical rainforest. From a distance, it's so green it's dazzling, as if nature's painter had gathered all the green there, brewing a vibrant vitality; up close, it exudes a mysterious atmosphere, and one doesn't know where the narrow paths in the forest will lead. Not far in, it's already covered in shadows. Ancient trees and vines compete for growth, all reaching for the light. Walking on the loose layer of decayed leaves, listening to the sound of the trees rustling in the wind, it feels as if one is floating in a green sea. The Tigra Nature Reserve alone covers 7,071 hectares, mainly consisting of cedar and oak trees. Naturally, there are many animals in the forest. The tropical rainforest in Tigra has six perennial springs.

As early as 1974, Honduras enacted the "Forest Protection Law" and established the National Forest Development Corporation to protect and develop forest resources. Currently, 57 ecological protection areas have been established nationwide, each with different regions and resources. Tigra is just a small one. In 1982, the "Rio Plata" protection area, declared by UNESCO as "Human Natural Heritage," covers 525,000 hectares; the central Olancho protection area covers 1.5 million hectares, spanning three provinces. Among them, 50% of Gracias a Dios Province and 45% of Colon Province's land area are covered by this vast primeval forest. Preliminary surveys show that it has more than 136 types of plant resources, mainly precious woods such as rosewood, walnut, and cedar. Rosewood is the most precious tropical redwood.

Ten years ago, Honduras' wood production and exports once ranked first. Later, it controlled the logging of forest resources in an orderly manner, especially the logging and export of precious redwoods. Currently, the country produces 10,000 feet of redwood annually under control, with 35% exported and 65% used for domestic processing and consumption, including processing into redwood furniture for export. The Honduran government has also taken many measures to keep this forest kingdom green.

**The "Maya Road"**

Columbus made five voyages to the Americas, but it was not until his fourth voyage in 1502 that he reached the coast of Honduras and named it the "Land of the Abyss." However, from the early 16th century to the mid-19th century, the Spanish colonizers who discovered the entire New World never found that in the "abyss" and the entire New World, there was a brilliant world that could rival the culture of Athens in the Old World. This was a world that had once shone brightly over the "abyss" and the entire New World, but it had mysteriously disappeared into the vast universe like its appearance and formation. This is the Copan Maya ruins located in the original forest on the border of western Honduras and Guatemala. From 1000 BC to AD 800, Copan was once the capital and religious and cultural center of the Maya people. Some archaeologists believe that Maya culture originated and formed in the original forest of Copan and then spread westward and northward to other regions of Central America and Mexico. Leaving San Pedro Sula and heading west, I don't remember how many turns the car made or how many mountains it passed before reaching that dense forest. Even now, you can't tell from the outside what kind of world lies within: peaks and valleys, ancient trees reaching the sky, covering and reflecting the magnificent pyramids, grand temples, exquisite carvings, stone statues, and mysterious hieroglyphic stone steps; the wind god, rain god, sun god; the stone statues of Maya rulers and imagined deities; all these, after a thousand years of erosion by wind and rain, still retain their overall integrity and the demeanor and grandeur of their heyday. Amazingly, on a large square stone base, the Maya carved the relief sculptures of the 16 previous tribal chiefs (rulers); each side has 6, and the top flat surface is carved with the "solar calendar" created by the Maya people. According to the Maya calendar, each year has 365.24 days, divided into 18 months, each with 20 days, and the remaining 5 days are the "unlucky days" when no religious activities can be conducted. Every 52 years, it is adjusted once; compared to the calendar used by humans now, it is only 2 days off in 1000 days. The Maya people of the Copan era could accurately calculate the time of solar and lunar eclipses. They invented the concept of "zero" in counting, 800 years earlier than the Old World. Although in the 1840s, some Maya cultural fragments were discovered around the Copan ruins, it was not until the 1930s that large-scale discoveries were made. Even now, archaeological excavations are still making new discoveries. There, I saw archaeologists placing small tags on piles of stone carvings, noting the time and place of discovery, awaiting future research and study. Not long ago, archaeologists also unearthed a Maya tomb in the forest of Copan. In 1980, the Copan ruins were declared a "World Heritage" by UNESCO, thus obtaining international aid for the protection and excavation of Copan. However, the Honduran government has realized that this "World Heritage" is first and foremost a great treasure of Honduras. After obtaining aid from the European Community, Honduras, together with neighboring Maya cultural countries Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, and El Salvador, jointly formulated a regional plan to open the "Maya Road" international tourism route, including visits and investigations of the Maya world civilization and related tourism and vacation projects, fully utilizing human and natural resources to promote national development.

Of course, so far, the "Maya Road" is still a blueprint. However, one can expect that on the brilliant trail left by the Maya, a new and even more dazzling rainbow will appear.

    深渊上的虹
    ——洪都拉斯掠影
    郭伟成
    “银山”
    特古西加尔巴坐落在青青的山坳里。沿着弯曲的公路，过乔卢特卡河，就进入了熙熙攘攘的城区。那时，刚好雨过天晴，一轮彩虹横架在如黛的山上，显得格外的壮丽。相传，16世纪70年代，当西班牙人远涉重洋来到这陌生的地方时，满身漂亮银饰的土著印第安人对他们说，“这儿是特古西加尔巴（意为“银子的山岗”）”。今天的特古西加尔巴，虽然不再以它的银矿著称，不过，仍然富于田园色彩：青山、绿水、晨、晚间淡淡的雾，飘飘悠悠。
    本来，我是买好了从墨西哥城经特古西加尔巴当天飞往圣彼德罗——苏拉的机票，但是，班机到达特城后才知道，由于缺乏燃料，国内航线已经停飞2天了。机场职员解释说：“没有德士古与埃索（美国石油公司），我们的‘萨萨’（洪都拉斯航空公司）就玩不转了。”后来，随着我对这个国家的进一步了解，才发现，没有“德士古与埃索”，还不止是“萨萨”玩不转。洪都拉斯经济贸易部副部长达里奥坦率地对我说：“我们的经济是不发达的，至今还是依附性的。”“美元一感冒，我们的伦皮拉（洪都拉斯货币）非咳嗽不可。”本世纪20年代，美国垄断资本进入了洪都拉斯，把这个物产富饶的国家，变成了美国的香蕉园。由于香蕉出口曾位居世界第一，洪都拉斯又被称作“香蕉之国”。直到现在，洪都拉斯仍然是一个以种植香蕉、咖啡等经济作物为主的农业国。香蕉占到农业产值的70％，占出口总值的39％，只不过，这庞大的香蕉资源仍然操纵在美国果品公司手里。在北部平原地带，从圣彼德罗——苏拉到特拉的路上，可以看到许多连成片的香蕉与油棕榈种植园，当地人说，那都是姓“标准”的
  （美国标准果品公司）。
    为了逐步摆脱单一经济状况，发展本国经济，洪都拉斯作了很大的努力，经历了曲折的发展。先是尝试实行“进口替代”的战略，争取摆脱对外来经济的依赖。近年来，洪都拉斯又通过开办自由区与客户工业，吸引外国投资与技术。现在，洪都拉斯已经逐步建立起一些纺织、食品与烟草、糖、咖啡等农产品的加工工业，扩大了非传统产品的生产与出口，仅仅1988年，非传统产品的出口就增长了12％。但是，在洪都拉斯最有市场的农业工业，仍然被外国资本垄断与操纵着。总之，整个洪都拉斯还是像“银山”特古西加尔巴一样，既在发展中变化着，又深深打着过去那个时代的烙印。
    林海
    在洪都拉斯旅行，极少看到裸露的地表。国家资源部的官员说，洪都拉斯国土面积的70％被野生植物所覆盖；森林面积占了整个国土面积的60％，真正是一个“森林之国”。由于人烟稀少，道路通达很少，因此，大多数森林仍然保持着原始状态。一位生态学者告诉我，洪都拉斯的森林里到底拥有多少种类动、植物资源，至今还是一个未知数。
      我到了北方沿海的兰塞蒂亚与特古西加尔巴附近的蒂格拉保护区。说来，也不过离城市几十公里开外，便已经是莽莽苍苍的热带雨林了。远看，绿得耀眼似的，好像大自然的画师，在那儿凝聚了所有的绿色，酿就了旺盛的生机；近瞧，则弥漫着神秘的氛围，不知道那林海间的羊肠小道会通向什么样的世界。进去不远，已经遮天蔽日了。古树藤萝，竞相生长，争着向光亮处伸去。踩在松松的腐殖层上，听着由远而近，风卷起的树涛声，竟仿佛浮在绿色的大海里似的。仅蒂格拉保护区就有7071公顷的方园。以雪松、橡树为主。林间动物自然很多。蒂格拉的热带雨林里有6处长年不断的泉水。
      早在1974年，洪都拉斯颁布了“森林保护法”，并建立了国家森林发展公司，保护、开发森林资源。目前，在全国按地域、资源不同，建立了57个生态保护区，蒂格拉只是其中很小
  一个。1982年被联合国教科文组织宣布为“人类自然财富”的“银河”（里约——普拉塔）保护区，占地面积52.5万公顷；中部奥兰乔保护区，占地150万公顷，横跨3个省。其中格拉西亚斯省50％与科隆省的45％土地
  面积，均在这片原始森林覆盖之下。据初步考察，这里拥有136种以上的植物资源，树木以桃花心木、胡桃木、雪松等贵重树木为主。桃花心木是最珍贵的热带红木。
      10年前，洪都拉斯的木材生产与出口曾一度占首位。后来，有计划地控制了对森林资源的采伐，尤其是控制对挑花心木等贵重红木的采伐与出口。目前，全国有控制地年产1万英尺红木，其中35％出口，65％用于国内的加工、消费，包括加工成红木家俱出口。洪都拉斯政府也努力采取了许多措施，使这个森林王国绿色常在。
    “玛雅路”
    哥伦布5次远航美洲，直到1502年的第4次航行才到达洪都拉斯沿海，并把这儿命名为“深渊之国”。但是，从16世纪初叶直到19世纪中的300余年，曾经发现了整个新大陆的西班牙殖民者，却始终没有发现，在这个“深渊之国”的原始丛林里，还有一个可以同旧大陆的雅典文化比美的辉煌世界，那是曾经出现在“深渊”及整个新大陆上空最绚丽的彩虹。只是，在西班牙征服以前，它已经神秘地像它的出现、形成一样，消失在茫茫的宇宙里。这就是坐落在洪都拉斯西部与危地马拉交界的原始丛林中的科潘玛雅遗址。公元前1000年到公元800年间，科潘曾经是玛雅人的首府，宗教与文化中心。有的考古专家认为，玛雅文化是在科潘的原始森林里发祥、形成，然后向西、向北，传播到中美洲其它地区和墨西哥。出圣彼德罗——苏拉往西而去，我不记得汽车拐了多少弯，绕过多少座山，才到达那个茂密的丛林中。直到现在，你仍然无法从外表断定里面有一个什么样的世界：峰回岭转，古树参天，遮盖着、掩映着壮丽的金字塔、宏伟的庙宇、精美的雕刻、石像，谜一般的象形文字石阶；那风神、雨神、太阳神；玛雅人世俗的统治者与想像中的神祇的石像，所有这些，经过一两千年日月风雨的侵蚀，依然保持着总体的完整与全盛时代的神态、气势。令人惊异的是，在一块巨大的方形石座上，玛雅人刻下了在这以前的16位部落酋长（统治者）的浮雕像；每一面6个，顶部平面上，雕刻着玛雅人创造的“太阳历”。根据玛雅历法，每年365.24天，分作18个月，每月20天，在剩余5天，是不能进行任何宗教活动的“倒运日”。每过52年调整一次；与人类现在通用的历法相比，大约1000天只相差2天。科潘时代的玛雅人已经能够准确地计算出日食与月食的时间。他们在计数中发明了“零”的概念，比旧大陆要早800年。虽然在19世纪40年代，已经有人在科潘遗址的外围零星地发现了玛雅文化的一些碎石，但是，真正大规模发现还是在本世纪30年代以后。直到现在，考古发掘工作还不断有新的发现。在那儿，我看到考古人员在成堆的石雕碎块上，系上小标签，注明发现的时间、地点，有待今后考证、研究。就在不久前，考古人员还在科潘的丛林里发掘出一处玛雅人的墓葬。1980年，科潘遗址被联合国教科文组织宣布为“世界财富”，从而得到对科潘保护与发掘工作的国际援助。但是，洪都拉斯政府已经意识到，这个“世界财富”，首先是洪都拉斯的巨大财富。在争取到欧洲共同体的援助后，洪都拉斯与毗邻的玛雅文化国家危地马拉、墨西哥、伯利兹、萨尔瓦多共同制订了一个地区性计划，开辟“玛雅路”国际旅游线，包括对玛雅世界文明的参观、考察及与此相关的各种旅游、度假项目，充分利用人文、自然资源，推动国家的发展。
      自然，到目前为止，“玛雅路”还只是一个规划蓝图。但是，可以期待，在玛雅人留下的灿烂轨迹上，会重新出现一道新的更加绚丽的彩虹。
