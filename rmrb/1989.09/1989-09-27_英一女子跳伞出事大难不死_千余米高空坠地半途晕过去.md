A British woman who was learning to parachute survived a near-fatal accident during her first jump when she failed to open her parachute in time. She fell from a height of one kilometer but miraculously survived.

Twenty-four-year-old Alison Davies panicked in mid-air. When she saw from her altimeter that she was only about 500 meters from the ground and realized she was too close to the ground, she fainted.

Doctors said that fainting in mid-air saved her. Losing consciousness made her body very relaxed, putting her in a state similar to a "rag doll," which reduced the impact when she hit the ground.

    英一女子跳伞出事大难不死
    千余米高空坠地半途晕过去
    据新华社伦敦九月二十五日电　一位初学跳伞的英国女子今天在她的头一次跳伞练习中因未能及时打开降落伞而从一千米高的空中坠落地面，但奇迹般地生还。
    二十四岁的艾莉森·戴维斯在空中惊慌失措，当她从高度表上看到离地面只剩近五百米、并意识到离地面太近了时就吓晕了过去。
    医生说，在空中晕昏过去救了她。失去知觉使她的身体十分放松，进入一种近似“玩具娃娃”的状态，从而减轻了坠地时的冲击力。
