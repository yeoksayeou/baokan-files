The province has a population of 41 million, with a cultivated land area of 26.65 million mu (approximately 1.78 million hectares), and an average of only 0.62 mu of cultivated land per person. Land resources are extremely precious. However, in some places, the illegal occupation of land by a few party members and cadres to build private houses has become rampant.

In the past two years, more than 300 party and government cadres in Sanmen County have illegally occupied land to build private houses in urban areas. Among them, more than 80 are at the level of bureau chief and above. For example, a deputy director of the County Construction Bureau, with a family of four originally living in a 72-square-meter public housing unit, illegally obtained 95 square meters of land for building in Sanmen County in 1988, actually occupying 176.58 square meters of land, and built a three-story villa with a unique design and clever layout, complete with a coffee shop and a commodity department. A deputy county magistrate, who already has a residence, applied for land to build a house in the name of his wife, and then occupied a lush paddy field to build a courtyard with a building area of 464.28 square meters and 17 rooms.

In Yiwu County, to the east of the Choucheng Small Commodity Market, there is a three-story villa. This is the residence of the director of the Yiwu County Judicial Bureau, Stepan. The Stepan family of four originally lived in the bureau's dormitory. After the new house was built, in addition to living there themselves, they also rented out the house to six individual business owners, earning an annual rent of approximately 6,300 yuan.

The above phenomena have greatly aroused the strong dissatisfaction of the local people and are deeply detested by the vast majority of party members and cadres. Recently, Zhejiang Province held a meeting to rectify the illegal construction of private houses by party and government cadres, deciding to make the rectification of illegal and disciplinary construction of private houses by party and government cadres an important part of the construction of clean government, and to seriously investigate and deal with party members and cadres who illegally occupy land.

    违法占地建房　有损公仆形象
　　浙江省着手清查干部建私房问题
    我省有4100万人口，耕地面积2665万亩，人均耕地面积只有0.62亩，土地资源十分宝贵。但是，在一些地方，少数党员干部非法占用土地建私房的歪风盛行。
    三门县近两年来，有300多名党政干部，在城镇违法占地建私房。其中，科局级以上干部有80多名。如县城建局一副局长，一家4口人原住72平方米公房。1988年，他利用职权，在三门县城非法获取建房用地95平方米，实际占用土地176.58平方米，建造了一座造型别致、构思精巧的三层小楼，附设咖啡厅和商品部。一位副县长，在已有住房的情况下，又以其妻子的名义申请建房用地，随之占用葱葱郁郁的稻田，建造了一幢建筑面积为464.28平方米、共有17个房间的庭院。
    在义乌县城稠城小商品市场东侧，有一座三层小楼，这便是义乌县司法局局长戚某的宅第。戚家有4口人，原住司法局宿舍。新房建成，除了自己居住，还将房子出租给6个个体户，年收入租金约6300元。
    上述现象，已在很大程度上引起了当地群众的强烈不满，更为绝大多数党员干部深恶痛绝。最近，浙江省召开了全省清理党政干部违纪建私房会议，决定把清理党政干部违法违纪建私房作为廉政建设的一项重要工作，严肃查处违法占地的党员干部。
