The global production of bicycles is expected to increase. A research report recently released by the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization based in Washington, states that there are currently 800 million bicycles in the world, which is double the number of cars. The annual production of bicycles is 100 million, three times the annual production of cars.

Some Western developed countries and several Mediterranean countries are considering policies and measures to facilitate the use of bicycles as a means of transportation.

The report indicates that bicycles, as a mode of transportation, can help address issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, land scarcity, and the economic burden of importing oil that are increasingly affecting developed countries.

    世界自行车将增产
    世界自行车的产量预计将会增加。设在华盛顿的环保研究机构——世界观察研究所最近公布的研究报告说，世界上现有自行车8亿辆，是汽车数量的两倍；自行车的年产量是1亿辆，是汽车年产量的3倍。
    西方一些发达国家以及一些地中海国家正在考虑制定一些政策和措施，为使用自行车作为交通工具的人提供方便。
      这份报告说，自行车作为交通工具，能帮助解决由于日益增多的汽车给发达国家带来的交通拥挤、空气污染、地皮紧张以及进口石油而造成的经济负担等问题。
