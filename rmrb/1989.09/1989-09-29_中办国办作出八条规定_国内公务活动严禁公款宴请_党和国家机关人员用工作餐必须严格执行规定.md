The Central Office of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council on Strictly Prohibiting the Use of Public Funds for Banquets and Related Work Meals in Domestic Official Activities (September 18, 1989)

According to the spirit of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Several Urgent Matters of Concern to the People," and with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the following regulations are hereby made on the prohibition of using public funds for banquets and related work meals in domestic official activities:

1. All levels of Party and state organs' personnel (including retired and resigned personnel, the same below) are strictly prohibited from using public funds for any form of banquet during various domestic official activities, including inspections and guidance by superiors to subordinates (including enterprises and institutions), investigations, exchanges between equals, inter-regional official visits, study tours, and personnel transfers.

2. Party and state organs' personnel who go to other places for the above-mentioned official activities should purchase meal tickets by themselves and pay the meal fees when they need to eat at their accommodations. Upon returning to the unit, they should reimburse the meal subsidy according to regulations.

3. Party and state organs' personnel who engage in official activities and cannot return home or to their units in their own city, or cannot return to their accommodations in other cities, may eat in the staff canteen or have work meals provided by the receiving unit. Work meals should be served in individual portions and generally should not have accompanying meals.

Work meals should not include expensive dishes, and public funds should not be used to purchase cigarettes or alcohol. The standard for work meal expenses should be determined by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government according to local conditions and reported to the Ministry of Finance for the record.

Those who have work meals should pay the meal fees according to the local regulations.

4. Any violation of the above regulations is a disciplinary offense. The public funds used must be recovered in full by the offending unit from the diners. The units and responsible persons who approve the use of public funds will be dealt with according to the "Provisional Regulations of the State Council on Penalties for Violations of Financial Regulations." If they are Party members, they will also be dealt with according to Party discipline. Each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government may formulate specific measures according to local conditions and report them to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Supervision, and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the record.

5. The Party discipline inspection organs and administrative supervision departments at all levels are responsible for supervising and implementing these regulations. If there are violators or units that refuse to execute the decisions of the Party discipline inspection organs and administrative supervision departments, if financial personnel do not resist public funds for eating and drinking, or if they retaliate against those who insist on principles and report violations, the responsible persons and direct responsible persons of the units should be given Party and administrative disciplinary sanctions. Those who violate the law should be dealt with according to the law.

For those who need to be given Party and administrative disciplinary sanctions for violating these regulations, they should be handled according to the authority and procedures for managing cadres. The Party discipline inspection organs and administrative supervision departments can also handle them directly.

6. All levels of Party and state organs holding various meetings should be conducted in accordance with the above spirit.

7. These regulations apply to all levels of Party organs, state organs, and people's organizations, institutions, and companies with administrative management functions. State-owned and collective enterprises should also follow the spirit of these regulations. For banquets and meals related to foreign affairs, the current regulations should still be followed.

8. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of issuance. Each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government may formulate implementation rules based on these regulations. Previous regulations that are inconsistent with these regulations shall be null and void.

      （1989年9月18日）
    根据《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》的精神，经党中央、国务院批准，现就在国内公务活动中严禁用公款宴请和有关工作餐问题，作如下规定：
    一、各级党和国家机关工作人员（含离休、退休人员，下同）在国内进行各种公务活动，包括上级到下级（含到企业、事业单位）检查指导工作、调查研究，同级之间、地区之间公务往来、参观学习以及干部工作调动等，严禁用公款搞任何形式的宴请。
    二、党和国家机关工作人员到外地进行上述公务活动，在住所需要就餐时，应由就餐个人自购餐券就餐，自行交纳伙食费，回单位后按规定报销出差伙食补助费。
    三、党和国家机关工作人员进行公务活动，在本埠不能回家或回单位，在外埠不能回住所吃饭的，可在职工食堂就餐或由接待单位供应工作餐。工作餐采用分餐制，一般不得陪餐。
    工作餐不准上价格昂贵的菜肴，不准用公款购买烟、酒。工作餐的金额标准由各省、自治区、直辖市根据本地实际情况确定，并报财政部备案。
    用工作餐的人员需按当地规定标准交纳伙食费。
    四、凡违反上述规定的，均属违纪行为。所动用的公款，必须由违纪单位负责向就餐者如数追还。对违反规定的单位和批准动用公款的责任人员，要按《国务院关于违反财政法规处罚的暂行规定》处理。是党员的，同时要按党的纪律进行处理。各省、自治区、直辖市党委、人民政府可根据本地情况制定具体办法，并报财政部、监察部和中纪委备案。
    五、各地区、各部门、各单位和各级党的纪律检查机关、行政监察部门负责本规定的监督实施。如有违纪人或所在单位拒不执行党的纪检机关和行政监察部门处理决定，财务人员对用公款吃喝不抵制，对坚持原则抵制违纪行为的人员和举报人员进行打击报复，要给予单位负责人和直接责任人员以党纪、政纪处分。触犯刑律的，要依法处理。
    对违反本规定人员需要给予党纪、政纪处分的，按照干部管理权限和处分程序进行处理。党的纪检机关和行政监察部门也可以直接处理。
    六、各级党和国家机关召开的各种会议，按上述精神办理。
    七、本规定适用于各级党的机关、国家机关和各人民团体、事业单位及兼有行政管理职能的公司。全民所有制和集体所有制企业也应参照本规定的精神办理。有关外事活动的宴请和用餐，仍按现行规定执行。
    八、本规定自发布之日起施行。各省、自治区、直辖市党委和人民政府可根据本规定制定实施细则。过去有关规定凡与本规定不一致的，一律以本规定为准。
