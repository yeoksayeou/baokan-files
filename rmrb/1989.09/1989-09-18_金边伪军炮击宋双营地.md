Phnom Penh puppet forces shell Roson's camp

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 17th: It was learned today that on the 15th, the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime and Cambodian resistance forces engaged in fierce combat in the northwestern border region of Cambodia, forcing Thai civilians to take cover in shelters.

According to a report from the Thai military, the Phnom Penh puppet forces shelled a camp of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front led by Prime Minister Roson of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. After the front sent reinforcements on the 16th, the fighting resumed.

According to a report from the Bangkok Post today, during the battle in Cambodia on the night of the 15th, more than 30 shells fell near a strategically important canal on the Thai border in the province of Aranyaprathet, causing minor damage to several houses in the village of Nong Chan.

The Cambodian resistance forces revealed today that they estimate there will be more battles along the western border of Cambodia during the so-called "withdrawal" of Vietnamese troops.

    据《曼谷邮报》今天报道，15日晚柬埔寨境内发生战斗时，有30多发炮弹落在泰国边境巴真府的一条具有战略意义的运河边，流弹使农占村的几所房屋遭到轻微损坏。
