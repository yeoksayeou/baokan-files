According to the spirit of the notice issued by the State Pricing Bureau guiding various regions to appropriately lower the prices of certain electrical refrigerators and other goods, some regions have already reduced the prices of certain refrigerators that had seen excessive price increases last year and had large price differentials.

Since this year, under the guidance of the national policy to rectify the economic environment and economic order, the supply and demand contradictions in the market have eased, and refrigerator prices have gradually fallen. Recently, based on production costs and the enterprise's capacity to bear, some models of refrigerators produced by state-designated refrigerator enterprises have been reduced in price by 5% to 25.6%.

    部分冰箱降价
    新华社北京9月21日电　按照国家物价局指导各地适当降低部分电冰箱等商品价格的通知精神，部分地区有些去年涨价过高、差价过大的电冰箱已降低了价格。
    今年以来，在国家治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序方针的指引下，市场供需矛盾趋缓，冰箱价格逐步回落。最近，根据生产成本和企业承受能力，国家定点电冰箱企业生产的部分牌号的电冰箱，已分别降价5％至25.6％。
