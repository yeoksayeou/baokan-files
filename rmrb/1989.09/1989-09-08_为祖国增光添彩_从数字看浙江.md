The numbers here may not fully reflect the overall economic development of Zhejiang, but they do illustrate the remarkable achievements made by the people of Zhejiang under the leadership of the Party over the past 40 years of hard work, adding luster to the socialist motherland.

National Economy

Social Total Output: Five Days Equals One Year
In 1988, the province achieved a gross national product of 715.42 billion yuan. The social total output for 7.6 days was equivalent to the total for the entire year of 1949.

In 1988, the social total output for 5 days and the national income for 8 days were both equivalent to the totals for the entire year of 1949.

In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 1423.65 billion yuan, equivalent to 4.6 days of output in 1949. Among this, the industrial output value was 1141.03 billion yuan, an increase of 193 times compared to 1949.

Township enterprises have emerged as a powerful force in the reform, with their output value surging from 2.6 billion yuan in 1978 to 62.1 billion yuan in 1988, an increase of nearly 23 times, accounting for two-thirds of the rural social total output.

In 1988, the province's total export value reached 1.62 billion US dollars. A total of 407 "three-resource" enterprises have been approved.

Doubling Income in a Decade: Significant Improvement in Living Standards
In 1988, the per capita net income of farmers in Zhejiang was 902 yuan, an increase of 18.2 times compared to 47 yuan in 1949. The growth rate was particularly significant in the 10 years since the reform and opening up. In 1978, the per capita net income was only 165 yuan, but by 1988, it had nearly doubled.

In 1988, the per capita living expenses of urban households in Zhejiang reached 1453 yuan, an increase of 11.5 times compared to 116 yuan in 1949. After adjusting for price increases, the actual increase was 4.3 times.

Land of Fish and Rice

Limited Arable Land: High Yield per Mu
Zhejiang's arable land accounts for only 1.63% of the national total, with 0.62 mu per capita, ranking last among all provinces. After liberation, Zhejiang gradually achieved self-sufficiency in grain. In 1966, Zhejiang became the first province in the country to achieve a grain yield per mu exceeding the target set in the "Outline." In 1972, it became the first province to achieve a grain yield per mu of over 1000 jin. In 1988, the grain yield per mu was 724 kg, and the per capita grain possession was nearly double that of the early days of liberation. The grain replanting index reached 226%, ranking first in the country.

Tenfold Increase: One Pound of Fish per Week
Zhejiang, known as the "Land of Fish and Rice," had an annual per capita fish possession of only 3.3 kg in the early days of the founding of the nation. During festivals, many places had to carve "wooden fish" to symbolize "abundance." Forty years later, despite the population doubling, the per capita fish possession has reached over 30 kg, allowing for 0.5 kg of fish per week, equivalent to the possession of 10 people in the early days of the nation.

The Zhoushan Fishery is the largest fishery in the country. Every 10 fish eaten by a person in the country includes one from Zhoushan.

Silk and Tea Capital

Annual Silk Production: Enough to Circle the Earth Ten Times
Historically known as the "Capital of Silk," Zhejiang now produces even more vibrant and renowned silk. In 1988, 14,793 tons of silk and 464.76 million meters of silk fabrics were produced, 17.8 times and 38.3 times the amounts in 1949, respectively. The silk fabrics produced in one year could circle the Earth 11.6 times. The vibrant silk family has now developed into 15 major categories and over 200 varieties, becoming Zhejiang's flagship export product, sold in over 100 countries and regions worldwide.

One Cup of Tea for Every Four People in China
Zhejiang is a famous tea-producing region. In 1988, 128,200 tons of tea were produced, an increase of 18.4 times compared to 6,600 tons in 1949, accounting for one-quarter of the national tea production. In every four cups of tea consumed in China, one cup is from Zhejiang.

In 1988, Zhejiang's tea exports earned 92.67 million US dollars for the country, continuing to lead the nation. In every four US dollars earned from tea exports in China, one dollar is from Zhejiang. Zhejiang's Tian Tan brand top-grade pearl tea and Tian Tan brand top-grade precious green tea have both won international gold awards.

Tourist Destination

Zhejiang's Scenic Spots: Guests Flocking In
Before 1978, tourism in Zhejiang was virtually non-existent. In 1979, 93,094 foreign friends, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan visited Zhejiang for tourism. By 1988, this number had increased to 383,360. In 1983, 14.58 million US dollars were earned from tourism, and by 1988, this had reached 56.24 million US dollars.

    为祖国增光添彩
    ——从数字看浙江
    这里的数字虽然不能反映浙江经济建设的全貌，但它说明了浙江人民在党的领导下，艰苦奋斗40年，取得了令人瞩目的成就，为社会主义祖国增添了光彩。
    国民经济
    社会总产值　五天抵一年　1988年，全省实现国民生产总值715.42亿元，7.6天就相当于1949年一年的总数。
    1988年，5天创造的社会总产值、8天创造的国民收入，均相当于1949年的总和。
    1988年实现工农业总产值1423.65亿元，4.6天就等于1949年的一年，其中工业总产值1141.03亿元，比1949年增长193倍。
    乡镇企业在改革中异军突起，产值从1978年26亿元猛增到1988年的621亿元，增加近23倍，占了农村社会总产值2／3。
    1988年，全省商品出口总额达16.2亿美元。现已批准设立的“三资”企业共407家。
    十年翻两番　生活大改善　1988年，浙江全省农民人均纯收入902元，比1949年的47元增长18.2倍，尤以改革开放10年的增长幅度为大，1978年还只有165元，到去年几乎翻了两番多。
    浙江全省城镇居民家庭人均生活费收入，1988年达到了1453元，比1949年的116元增长11.5倍，剔除价格上涨因素，实际增长4.3倍。
    鱼　米　之　乡
    人均耕地少　亩产超千斤　浙江耕地只占全国总耕地的1.63％，人均耕地0.62亩，列全国各省之末。解放后由缺粮省逐渐实现粮食基本自给。1966年浙江成为全国第一个粮食亩产超“纲要”的省。1972年又成为全国第一个粮食亩产超千斤的省。1988年，粮地单产724公斤，人均占有粮食接近解放初两个人的占有量。粮食复种指数达226％，居全国首位。
    今昔十比一　一周一斤鱼　素称“鱼米之乡”的浙江，建国初期每年人均鱼的占有量只有3.3公斤。逢年过节，不少地方还得刻“木鱼”以示“吉庆有余（鱼）”。40年后的今天，尽管人口多了1倍，可按全省鱼产量计算，每人每年鱼的占有量达30多公斤，一周就可吃到0.5公斤鱼，1个人的占有量相当于建国初期10个人的占有量。
    舟山渔场是全国最大渔场，全国每人吃的每10条鱼中就有一条“舟山鱼”。
    丝茶之府
    一年产绸缎　地球绕十圈　历史上就有“丝绸之府”之称的浙江，如今生产的丝绸更是色彩斑斓，名扬四海。1988年生产丝14793吨，丝织品46476万米，分别为1949年的17.8倍和38.3倍。去年一年生产的丝织品连起来可绕地球11.6个圈。繁花似锦的丝绸大家庭，如今已发展到绸、缎、锦、纺、绢、绫、罗、纱、绡、绒等15个大类和200多个品种，成为浙江出口的拳头产品，畅销世界100多个国家和地区。
    国人四杯茶　浙江有其一　浙江是全国著名的茶乡。1988年产茶12.82万吨，比1949年的0.66万吨增长18.4倍，占全国茶叶总产量的1／4。在我国的每4杯茶中，浙江就占了1杯。
    1988年，浙江茶叶出口为国家创汇9267万美元，继续在全国夺魁。在我国用茶叶换取的美元中，每4元中就有1元是浙江的。浙江的天坛牌特级珠茶和天坛牌特级珍眉绿茶，先后荣获国际金奖。
    旅游之地
    浙江多胜景　嘉宾喜盈门　1978年以前，浙江旅游还是空白。1979年，前来浙江旅游观光的外国友人和华侨、港澳台同胞93094人，1988年增加到383360人。1983年创汇1458万美元，1988年已达5624万美元。
