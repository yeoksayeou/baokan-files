An oil well in Jianghan Oilfield that had been burning for a week was finally extinguished at 5:15 PM on September 22 after more than 3,000 officials and workers fought tirelessly to put out the blaze.

The well, located in a high-yield oil and gas area of Jianghan Oilfield, caught fire on September 16. At 5:45 AM that day, a drilling team was operating the well at a depth of 1,483 meters when a sudden blowout occurred, followed by a fire. At its peak, the flames reached a height of 45 meters. The wellhead equipment was immediately engulfed in flames and collapsed, resulting in direct economic losses of over 10 million yuan.

Authorities responded swiftly to the incident. On September 17, Hubei Province Governor Guo Zhenqian rushed to the scene to organize and direct the firefighting efforts. The China National Petroleum Corporation and the Sichuan Petroleum Administration promptly dispatched fire-fighting experts. The Hubei Provincial Public Security Department mobilized over 200 firefighters and more than 30 fire trucks and dry powder cannons from over 10 units across the province to participate in the firefighting and rescue operations.
