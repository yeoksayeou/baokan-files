The high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission project connecting the East China Power Grid with Zhoushan Island, known as the Zhoushan HVDC industrial test project, passed national inspection on September 1 and officially began operation. The project started construction in early 1984 and was completed and put into trial operation in 1987. It is China's first HVDC project designed, manufactured, installed, and debugged independently, with a voltage of 100 kilovolts and a current of 50 amperes.

The transmission line starts from Dadao Town in Ningbo in the southwest and extends to Aotoupu in Zhoushan Main Island in the northeast. Its completion and operation not only enable all cities and regions in Zhejiang Province to form a large power grid, providing low coal consumption electricity from the East China Power Grid to the water-scarce and coal-deficient islands, but also establish China's first HVDC industrial test base.

    舟山直流输电工程正式运行
    据新华社9月3日电  连接华东电网与舟山岛的电力大动脉——舟山直流输电工业性试验工程，9月1日通过国家鉴定，正式投入运行。这项工程于1984年初动工，1987年建成投入试运行，是我国第一项自行设计、制造、安装和调试的高压直流输电工程，电压为100千伏，电流为50安培。
    输电线路西南起自宁波大碶镇，东北至舟山本岛鳌头浦。它的建成投产，不仅可以使浙江全省各市、地连成一个大电网，把华东电网的低煤耗电能向缺水少煤的海岛提供，而且为我国建立了第一个直流输电工业性试验基地。
