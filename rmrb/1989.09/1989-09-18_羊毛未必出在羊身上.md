The phrase "wool comes from sheep" is unlikely to be disputed by anyone. If wool doesn't come from sheep, could it come from cats, dogs, donkeys, or other animals? However, in reality, there are indeed strange occurrences where "wool" doesn't come from "sheep."

The news reports that in a certain county, the party and government agencies have cracked down on the use of public funds for feasts, and within a few days, the "wind has stopped and the waves have calmed." However, the entertainment expenses of enterprises not only did not decrease but even increased. The supervisory department investigated thoroughly and found that the "trick" was that some party and government agencies had secretly shifted their entertainment expenses to the enterprises. Look, where did this "wool" come from?

The news also reports that a certain bureau's leaders had been longing to purchase an imported car, but unfortunately, the "financial god" was experiencing a shortage. When the bureau chief was frowning, a subordinate came up with a clever idea, "transforming" some money, finally allowing the leader to get his wish. This "wool" did not come from the "sheep" either.

Again, the news reports that some hospitals, in order to "expand income," not only prescribed Nestlé coffee and wine as "medicine" for patients but also gave patients bras and pearl necklaces as "medicine." There were even strange incidents where refrigerators and VCRs were prescribed as "medicine." This "wool" did not come from the "sheep" either.

Why do these strange phenomena occur?

In recent years, some of our "regulations" and "disciplines" have been too general and vague, making it unclear who is right and who is wrong. This is one reason. Another reason is that policies are inconsistent, leading to neglect in some areas. For example, the public's opposition to the use of public funds for feasts should be addressed uniformly from top to bottom, without the need for "specific situation, specific analysis." However, some places have only regulated party and government agencies, leaving enterprises unaddressed, resulting in the phenomenon of "government feasts, enterprise payment"—"wool" not coming from sheep. A third reason is the lack of necessary punitive measures. Some "regulations" and "disciplines" only specify what is not allowed, without specifying the consequences of violations. Thus, some people view these "official documents" as "silver bullets" and act with impunity, doing as they please, resulting in "knocking down a jar, only to see a gourd float up." Then there are "regulations" that are strictly enforced, but the "referees" enforcing them are not strict. Clearly, actions like "avoiding red lights by going around" are not allowed, but the "referees" turn a blind eye, wave their hands, and let the violators slip away. With such "referees" who do not follow the rules, it is no wonder that some people dare to peddle their tricks under "repeated orders," causing policies to be distorted!

However, the situation is different now. From the central government to local authorities, efforts are being made to gradually build a clean government, and some "rules" are becoming more complete. It is believed that the strange phenomenon of "wool coming from sheep" will decrease and eventually be stopped in the future.

### 羊毛未必出在羊身上

　　羊毛未必出在羊身上
　　寇占文
      “羊毛出在羊身上”，这话恐怕不会有人有疑义。羊毛不出在羊身上，还有出在猫、狗、驴乃至其他什么身上吗？不过，现实真有“羊毛”不出在“羊”身上的怪事。
    报载：某县党政机关刹公款吃喝风，几天之内便“风止浪平”。然而企业的吃喝费用非但未减，反而又上了“台阶”，监察部门穷追细查，原来个中“猫腻”，是某些党政机关的吃喝费悄悄地转嫁到了企业。瞧，这“羊毛”出在了哪？
    报载：某局领导朝思暮想购买进口轿车，无奈“财神爷口袋”闹饥荒。局头头眉头不展之时，下属发挥了奇妙神通，“变通”来了“银子”若干，终使领导如愿。这“羊毛”又没有出在“羊”身上。
    还是报载：某些医院为了“扩大收入”，不仅将雀巢咖啡、葡萄酒作为“药品”开给病人，还将乳罩、珍珠项链等作为“药品”送到病员手中，甚至还有将冰箱、录放机开成“药方”的奇闻。此“羊毛”又没有出在“羊”身上。
    为什么会出现这些怪现象呢？
    这几年，我们有些“规定”、“纪律”太原则，太模糊，孰是孰非不具体，不分明，眼睁睁地被人钻空子。此原因之一；政策不一，顾此失彼可算是原因之二。譬如，对群众反对的公款吃喝风本应上下左右来个“一刀切”，用不着什么“具体情况具体分析”，但有些地方只对党政机关进行了规定，对企业则未置可否，结果便出现了“机关吃喝，企业出钱”——“羊毛”不出在羊身上的怪事；原因之三便是缺乏必要的惩罚措施。有些“规定”和“纪律”，只明确了“不准”如何如何，而没规定违反了该“怎么办”，于是有些人把一些“红头文件”看作是“银样蜡枪头”，有恃无恐，想咋办还咋办，结果“按倒葫芦浮起瓢”；再就是“规定”搞得很严，但执行“规定”的“裁判”不严，明明不准搞“遇到红灯绕着走”的一套，可“裁判”眼开眼闭，手一挥，违纪者溜之乎也。有这样不按“章法”办事的“裁判”，难怪有人敢在“三令五申”下兜售其奸，执行政策走样！
    不过，现在情况不同了，从中央到地方都正在逐步进行廉政建设，一些“规则”也日趋完善，相信“羊毛出在羊身上”的怪事今后一定会减少以至于制止。
