Four years ago, when Xu Yisheng took up the position of Party Secretary of Zhangshu City in Jiangxi Province, he was overwhelmed with countless tasks.

He knew that since liberation, this county-level city had already had 17 Party Secretaries, changing every two years or so, making interpersonal relationships complicated. People often said, "It's hard to do work in Zhangshu."

To get Zhangshu on the right track, what should be prioritized? Xu Yisheng thought deeply and conducted investigations, listening to the opinions of cadres and the masses.

Once, someone told him about an incident that shocked him. Chen Zhuanqun, a procurement officer at the Third Construction Company, was known as the "tyrant of Zhangshu." His brother and sister were both county-level cadres. Relying on his influence, Chen had defrauded over 420,000 yuan from various places across the country. In 1984, the Public Security Bureau arrested him, but soon released him. Someone asked, "Comrade Secretary Xu, how can public sentiment be appeased with such handling of Chen?"

"Right! No matter who it is, if they break the law, the law must be enforced strictly, and personal relationships must not be considered." He thought, "To tackle the myriad problems, we must start with people. If the cadre issue is not resolved, how can the work be done well?" He immediately convened a standing committee meeting to unify everyone's understanding and decided to form a joint investigation team consisting of the Public Security, Procuratorate, and Court.

After the facts were investigated and the case was retried, the news that Chen Zhuanqun was sentenced to 13 years in prison spread, and the citizens cheered, while those who liked to pull strings felt a sense of deterrence.

For a period, a batch of intellectuals were promoted to leadership positions, but some lost their expertise and could not adapt to administrative work. What should be done? Xu Yisheng, being a university graduate, understood the situation. After investigation, he immediately stated, "Use people according to their abilities, don't tie your own hands!"

Enough Town's Town Mayor, Ao Jueren, was a loyal and honest person and an agronomist, but he found it difficult to lead an entire town's administration. Xu Yisheng suggested removing him from the position of town mayor and transferring him to the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Municipal Committee to work on agricultural technology in his field. Ao Jueren was very satisfied.

In March of this year, Xu Yisheng sent 7 deputy-bureau-level "three-door" cadres to the countryside and towns for training. Someone said to him, "Are you being too strict?" He smiled and said, "Without understanding the actual situation, relying solely on book knowledge, working in the municipal committee for a long time will definitely lead to misjudgments, just like a person who doesn't exercise easily gets sick, it's not good." He believed that the selection and appointment of cadres should only consider their virtue and ability, their performance, and discard all relationships and connections.

This year, all members of the Municipal Committee went out to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the leading cadres of various departments and 17 towns, promoting the capable and demoting the incompetent, adjusting 78 people, and laying a solid foundation for the development of Zhangshu City by eliminating the "relationships" in personnel matters.

One day, Xu Yisheng received a letter. Upon opening it, he found two humorous poems.

The first one: "Zhangshu, Zhangshu, with wise leadership, no water during the day, no light at night."

The second one: "Dim lights, uneven roads, pits and holes that can trip people."

Facing these two humorous poems, he thought: This reflects the urgent feelings of the people towards urban construction.

However, urban construction requires money, and the city's economy must be developed to have money. Zhangshu's Four Special Liquor is famous nationwide. Additionally, people call Zhangshu the "City of Medicine." Only by seizing these two advantages can Zhangshu's economy be revitalized. At this time, someone ran to the higher authorities to report on him, saying he had 12 charges.

He was very angry but not afraid at all, continuing to work according to the original plan. The 12 charges quickly collapsed, and the city's fiscal revenue increased by 42% year on year.

With money, roads were built, water and electricity were available, and a water park was built for the citizens. Last year, 48 million yuan was remitted to the higher authorities, making Zhangshu City the first among nearly a hundred counties (cities and districts) in Jiangxi Province.

At this time, someone suggested, "The municipal government office building is from the 1950s, old and dilapidated; the Municipal Committee is borrowing a building from the 'Youth Office' of the 1960s to work in; now several cadres are cramped together and really can't be arranged, a new office building is needed." However, if you go to Zhangshu City to find the Municipal Committee or Municipal Government, you still have to ask for directions, as they are in a small street.

"Hard work and self-reliance must never be abandoned!" Xu Yisheng said at a mid-level cadre meeting, "From a broader perspective, spending 10 million yuan to build a Municipal Committee and Municipal Government compound is nothing to be proud of, and there is money for it; but from a strict requirement perspective, not building an office building first, what's wrong with that?"

Some people said that Xu Yisheng was too strict, did not understand, but also did not dare to violate, fearing that Xu Yisheng would not recognize them with a stern face.

Now, investigating cadres' relatives doing business and building private houses illegally, in other counties (cities), requires the higher authorities to send a working group. In Zhangshu City, the workload is not large because there are few offenders, and it is clear once investigated. With the improvement of cadres' work style, the social security situation is also better than in other places.

When talking about this, Xu Yisheng always said, "Communist Party members should never have greed. I issued a warning to cadres a little earlier, it was strict, but as the saying goes: strictness is love, lenience is harm!"

Xu Yisheng was 42 years old when he came to Zhangshu City, with a head of black hair; now, in just over four years, his hair has thinned and started to turn gray.

I think this can show how much effort and thought he has put into the revitalization of Zhangshu City!

    “严是爱  松是害”
    ——记樟树市委书记徐宜生
    本报记者　赵相如
    4年前，徐宜生担任江西省樟树市市委书记时，千头万绪的事压了过来。
    他知道，解放以来，樟树这个县级市，连他已经换了17任市委书记，两年左右换一任，搞得人际关系复杂，人们都说：“樟树这地方工作可不好搞。”
    樟树要上去，先抓什么？徐宜生反复苦思，下去调查，听取干群意见。
    一次，有人告诉他一件事，让他吃惊。第三建筑公司有个采购员叫陈锻群，人称“樟树一霸”。他的弟弟、妹妹都是县级干部。陈锻群依仗权势，先后在全国各地诈骗钱财42万多元。1984年公安局将他收审，没过多久，又把他放了。有人问：“徐书记，这么处理姓陈的，民心能顺得了吗！”
    “对！不管是谁，犯了法一定要执法如山，不能徇私情。”他想：“千头万绪要从人下手，干部问题不解决，工作怎么能搞得上去？”他立即召开常委会，统一大家认识，决定由公、检、法三家成立一个联合调查组。
    事实查清重新审理后，陈锻群被判处有期徒刑13年的消息一传出，市民为之欢快叫好，而对一些喜欢拉拉扯扯的人来说，却产生了一种威慑力。
    有一阵子提拔了一批知识分子当领导，有的丢了专业又不能适应行政工作，怎么办？徐宜生也是大学毕业生，明白实情。经过调查后立即表态：“量才用人，不要自己捆住自己嘛！”
    经楼镇镇长敖菊根，为人忠厚，是名农艺师，可是搞一个镇的行政领导实有困难。徐宜生建议免除他的镇长职务，调到市委农工部搞农业技术本行，敖菊根很满意。
    今年3月，徐宜生又把市里7名副局级的“三门”干部放到乡、镇去锻炼。有人说他：“你是不是太严了点？”他笑笑说：“不了解实际情况，光有书本知识，在市委机关里工作，日子一长准会判断出误，好比不锻炼身体的人容易得病一样，没啥好处。”他认为，干部选拔任用只能看德才，看政绩，摒弃一切关系学。
    这年底，市委常委全部出马，对各部委、17个乡镇的领导班子进行全面考察，能者上、不行者下，调整了78人，为樟树市的发展一扫“人事关系学”打下了扎实的基础。
    一天，徐宜生收到一封信，打开一看是两首打油诗。
    第一首：“樟树樟树，领导有方，白天无水，晚上无光。”
    第二首：“灯不明、路不平，坑坑洼洼跌死人。”
    面对这两首打油诗，他想：这反映了群众对市政建设的迫切心情。
    可是市政建设需要钱，市里的经济要搞上去才有钱。樟树的四特酒全国有名。另外，人们称樟树为“药都”，只有抓住这两项优势，才能振兴樟树的经济。这时有人跑到上级那儿去告他的状，说他有12条罪状。
    他很恼火，但一点不怕，继续按原计划干。12条罪状很快不攻自破，而全市财政收入每年以42％的速度递增。
    有了钱，路修起来了。水电有了，还为市民盖了个水上公园，去年给上级上缴了4800万元，在江西全省近百个县（市）区中首屈一指。
    这时有人建议：“市府办公楼是五十年代的，又旧又破；市委是借了六十年代的‘知青办’的楼在办公；现在几套班子挤在一堆实在摆布不开，需要盖个办公大楼了。”但是，你走进樟树市找市委、市府还得问人，它们在一条小街里。
      “艰苦奋斗什么时候都不能丢！”徐宜生在一次中层干部会上说：“从大的方面看，花1000来万盖个市委市府大院，没啥了不起，也有这个钱；但是从严要求说，先不盖办公大楼，有什么不可以的？”
    有人说徐宜生管得太严了，不理解，但也不敢违犯，怕徐宜生黑脸不认人。
    现在清查干部家属经商、违纪盖私房这类事，在别的县（市），需要上级派工作组去。在樟树市查起来工作量不大，因为冒犯者很少，一查就明。干部作风正了，社会治安情况也比其他地方要好一些。
    谈到这一点，徐宜生总是说：“共产党员什么时候都不要有贪心。我提早一些对干部发出警告，严是严了一点，但是俗话说：严是爱，松是害呀！”
    徐宜生来樟树市时是42岁，一头黑发；如今不过4年多点，他的头发秃了大半，而且开始灰白了。
    我想，这很可以看出他在为樟树市的振兴中花去了多少精力与才思！
