After a comprehensive review of its defense and foreign policy, U.S. President Bush announced in May this year that his new policy towards the Soviet Union is "going beyond containment." This policy has drawn the attention of countries around the world.

The introduction of the "going beyond containment" policy marks a significant change in the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. still views the Soviet Union as its primary adversary, it has effectively abandoned the "containment" and "Cold War" policies of building military, economic, and political "barriers" around the Soviet Union for over four decades after the war. Instead, it has shifted to promoting "going beyond containment," actively developing relations with the Soviet Union, engaging in cooperation, using economic and cultural means to infiltrate, and pulling the Soviet Union into the "international family." The Bush administration refers to this major shift as a "complete change in the U.S. post-war policy concept towards the Soviet Union," signifying that "the U.S. foreign policy will undergo a philosophical transformation." According to the Bush administration, this "new strategy" aims to "adapt to the development of Soviet economic and political reforms" and strive to "effectively control" them, making Soviet policies "more conciliatory" and developing in a direction "favorable to the United States."

The U.S. proposal for a "going beyond containment" policy towards the Soviet Union has deep background reasons.

Firstly, the international situation is trending towards easing tensions. Changes in the relationship between the U.S. and its allies, as well as changes in the domestic political climate in the U.S., have forced the Bush administration to alter its policy towards the Soviet Union. The current overall international situation is shifting from tension to easing, from confrontation to dialogue, with the roles of science and technology and the economy rising, and the role of the military relatively declining. The international public opinion against the "containment" policy is growing louder. Western European countries generally believe that the Soviet threat has significantly decreased and are actively developing relations with the Soviet Union. The U.S. can no longer use the "confronting the Soviet threat" and "containing Soviet expansion" as the sole factor to unite its allies and maintain the existence of NATO. It must adopt new policies, concepts, and strategic goals that allies are willing to accept to add new cohesion to U.S.-European relations and the NATO organization. Within the U.S., people's concept of national security has also changed. Both the ruling and opposition parties are more concerned about the threat posed by the rising economic power of Japan and Western Europe, as well as issues such as international drug trafficking, terrorism, and environmental pollution, which seem to overshadow concerns about the Soviet threat. They generally demand a reduction in military spending and an end to the arms race.

Additionally, the U.S. government believes that Gorbachev's new thinking and certain changes in the Soviet Union's domestic and foreign policies are unprecedented and welcome. However, the Bush administration also believes that the Soviet system is a "deeply rooted philosophical and political institution" that has not undergone significant changes so far. Therefore, the direction of the Soviet reforms and what these reforms mean for the U.S. are still uncertain. In a situation where the Soviet Union presents both "unprecedented opportunities" and "new challenges" for the U.S., with an uncertain future, Bush proposed seeking a "new path to compete with the Soviet Union." This is an important reason for the Bush administration's decision to implement the "going beyond containment" policy towards the Soviet Union.

The Bush administration's focus in implementing this policy towards the Soviet Union is to expand areas of contact and cooperation with the Soviet Union to effectively influence the direction of Soviet policies. This policy aims to achieve the U.S.'s long-term strategic goals towards the Soviet Union while also gaining "strategic benefits" from the Soviet Union in the short term. From current practices, the specific requirements are: militarily, to demand that the Soviet Union reduce its military forces to a level where they pose no threat to the West and truly achieve a "defensive strategy"; politically, to demand that the Soviet Union accelerate its reform pace and move towards Western-style "democracy" to achieve so-called "pluralism"; economically, to demand that the Soviet Union develop towards a "market economy"; in foreign policy, to demand that the Soviet Union respect the self-determination rights of Eastern European countries, abandon "Brezhnev Doctrine," and give up aggressive expansionist policies. Of course, the U.S. still seeks to maintain a strong military force to exert some pressure on the Soviet Union, preparing for the possibility of being "caught off guard" if Soviet policies change.

The Bush administration's new policy of "going beyond containment" towards the Soviet Union will create new contradictions and issues in the relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are two superpowers, and confrontation remains the dominant aspect. The Soviet Union's improvement of relations with the U.S. is aimed at creating a favorable international environment for domestic reforms and rapid economic and technological development. The Soviet Union is not unaware of certain U.S. schemes and is strongly opposed to them. Gorbachev has clearly stated that the Soviet Union will adhere to the socialist path and oppose the "political pluralism" advocated by the U.S. After Bush announced the implementation of the "going beyond containment" policy towards the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's *Pravda* immediately criticized Bush for "attempting to propose conditions for the U.S. to promote the Soviet Union's entry into the international family." Therefore, the prospects of the U.S.'s new policy towards the Soviet Union, even the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council admits, is "a distant goal, like Mount Kilimanjaro (the highest mountain in Africa), it can only be seen as a target from afar."

### 美国对苏联“超越遏制”的政策

    美国对苏联“超越遏制”的政策
    王保勤　倪童军
    美国总统布什在全面审查国防外交政策后于今年五月宣布其新的对苏政策是“超越遏制”，这一政策已引起世界各国的关注。
      “超越遏制”政策的推出是美国对苏政策的一项重大变化。美国虽仍视苏联为主要对手，但是，它实际上放弃了战后四十多年来在苏联周围建立军事、经济和政治“壁垒”，围堵苏联的“遏制”和“冷战”政策，转为推行“超越遏制”，积极同苏联发展关系，进行合作，以经济文化手段进行渗透，将苏联“拉进国际大家庭”的新政策。布什政府称这一重大转折是“美国战后对苏政策概念的彻底改变”，标志着“美国的外交政策将进行哲学思想的变革”。照布什政府的说法，这个“新战略”就是“顺应苏联经济和政治改革形势的发展”，并力图“有效地予以驾驭”，使苏联的政策“有更多的妥协性”，“朝着有利于美国的方向”发展。
    美国提出对苏联“超越遏制”政策是有其深刻背景的。
    首先，国际形势趋向缓和。美国和盟国的关系有所变化，以及美国国内政治气候的变化，促使布什政府不得不改变对苏政策。当前整个国际局势的大趋势是由紧张转向缓和，由对抗转向对话，科技和经济的作用上升，军事的作用相对下降，世界舆论反对“遏制”政策的呼声日益高涨。西欧国家普遍认为苏联的威胁已明显下降，都在积极同苏联发展关系，美国已不能再像以前那样用“对抗苏联威胁”、“遏制苏联扩张”来作为团结盟国、维持北约存在的唯一要素，不得不采用盟国乐于接受的新政策、新概念和新的战略目标来为美欧关系和北约组织增添新的凝合剂。在美国国内，人们对国家安全的概念也发生变化，朝野人士对日本、西欧日益崛起的强大经济实力所构成的威胁以及对国际毒品走私、恐怖主义、环境污染等问题的担心，似在超过对苏联威胁的担心。他们普遍要求削减军费，结束军备竞赛。
    此外，美国政府认为，戈尔巴乔夫新思维的提出，苏联对内对外政策发生的某些变化，是过去未曾有过的，值得欢迎。但另一方面，布什政府又认为苏联的制度是一种“根深蒂固的哲学和政治制度”，迄今这一制度“没有发生重大变化”，因此对于苏联的改革究竟向何处去，这一改革对美国意味着什么，尚捉摸不定。在苏联对美国来说既有“空前机会”，又有“新的挑战”，前途未卜的情况下，布什提出要寻求一条“同苏联较量的新道路”。这是布什政府决定对苏联推行“超越遏制”政策的一个重要原因。
    布什政府推行这项对苏政策的着眼点是同苏联扩大联系和合作的领域，以便有效地影响苏联的政策方向。这一政策既要有利于实现美国对苏联的长期战略目标，又要有利于当前从苏联获取“战略好处”。从目前做法来看，其具体要求是：军事上，要求苏联将军事力量削减到对西方无威胁、真正实现“防御战略”的水平；政治上，要求苏联加快改革步伐，向西方的“民主”演进以实现所谓“多元化”；经济上，要求苏联向“市场经济”发展；在对外政策上，要求苏联尊重东欧地区国家的自决权利，抛弃“勃列日涅夫主义”，放弃咄咄逼人的扩张政策。当然美国在这样做的时候仍然力求保持强大的军事力量，借以对苏施加一定压力。准备在苏联政策有变时不至于“手足无措”。
    布什政府对苏联推行“超越遏制”的新政策将使美国同苏联的关系产生新的矛盾和问题。美苏是两个超级大国，双方的对抗仍是主导方面。苏联同美国改善关系是为了国内改革和迅速发展经济科技创造有利的国际环境，对美国的某些图谋苏联并非没有觉察，而且也是极力反对的。戈尔巴乔夫已明确表示，苏联将坚持社会主义道路，反对美国所说的“政治多元化”。苏联《真理报》在布什宣布对苏推行
  “超越遏制”政策之后，立即指责布什“试图提出美国努力促使苏联加入世界大家庭的条件”。因此，美国对苏新政策的前景，连美国国家安全委员会发言人也承认，它只是“一个遥远的目标，像乞力马扎罗山（非洲最高山）一样，只能在远处把它看作目标。”
