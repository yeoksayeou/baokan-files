Now, many enterprises and units have set up "little treasuries," maintaining off-book accounts, which has become a prominent issue in financial and fund management.

The total amount of off-book funds nationwide is not a small figure. According to calculations by relevant departments in Shanghai, the city's various off-book incomes reach 1.5 billion yuan, accounting for 15% to 20% of the total wages of employees. Some units' "little treasuries" hold amounts ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, with some even exceeding one million yuan. A certain textile machinery factory in Shanghai had 420,000 yuan in its off-book account, which was kept secret from the public. Recently, due to a theft case, the amount was revealed. Apart from the 250,000 yuan already spent, there remained 170,000 yuan in cash and bank deposits. It is understood that the 133 enterprises in Shanghai's textile system have off-book funds totaling 1.2 billion yuan.

The loss of control over off-book funds reflects the serious consequences of chaotic financial and fund management.

Firstly, the sources of off-book funds in many units are not legitimate. Some enterprises producing and operating short-supply and scarce goods, through high-price speculation, extract price differences, evade taxes, and conceal the price difference income without reporting it. They use personal names or pseudonyms to deposit the money in banks. The official books show normal transactions without any flaws. They use the method of setting up secret books to cover up illegal income, without any vouchers, to evade the inspection of supervisory departments.

Secondly, it encourages reckless spending. Many enterprises and institutions purchase restricted goods, give employees bonuses beyond the standard, provide welfare, distribute goods, and various expenses for banquets, travel, and other activities, most of which are paid with off-book funds.

The loss of control over off-book funds disrupts the economic order, fuels the expansion of consumption funds, and intensifies the contradiction between total demand and total supply. More seriously, it corrupts the cadre and employee teams, and provides opportunities for various corrupt practices and economic crimes.

In the process of rectification and adjustment, this issue should not be overlooked. Enterprises and institutions should conduct self-inspections to correct the problems of setting up off-book funds and violating financial discipline. For those problems that are not self-discovered but are found through inspections, they should be dealt with strictly, confiscating what should be confiscated, fining what should be fined, and holding the relevant parties and leaders accountable according to the law. Only in this way can the spread of off-book funds be curbed, financial discipline be strictly enforced, and funds be properly managed and used.

    查一查账外资金
    险峰　钊拓
    现在，不少企业单位私设“小金库”，建帐外帐，已成为财务和资金管理中的一个突出问题。
    全国帐外资金有多少？不是一个小数目。据上海市有关部门测算，全市各种帐外收入达15亿元，占职工工资总额的15％—20％。一些单位的“小金库”，拥有款项，少则几万，多则几十万，甚至有超过百万元的。上海某纺织机械厂，厂内“小金库”拥有金额42万元，一向对外保密，近因失盗报案，不得不露底，除已用去25万元之外，尚余现金和存折计17万元。据了解，上海市纺织系统133家企业的“小金库”，拥有资金达1.2亿元。
    帐外资金失控，反映出财务管理和资金管理的混乱带来的后果是严重的。
    其一，不少单位帐外资金来路不正。如一些生产经营短线产品和紧俏物资的企业单位，通过高价倒卖，提取价差，逃避纳税，将价差收入隐匿不报，以个人名义或化名存入银行。明帐上平进平出，看不出破绽。他们是用建暗帐的办法把非法收入掩盖起来，无凭无据，以逃避监督部门检查。
    其二，助长乱支乱花。一些企事业单位购置违控商品，给职工超标准发放奖金，搞福利、发实物以及各种交际、旅游费用支出，大多是用帐外资金支付的。
    帐外资金失控，搞乱了经济秩序，助长了消费基金膨胀，加剧了总需求与总供给的矛盾。更为严重的是，腐蚀了干部职工队伍，也为各种腐败现象和经济犯罪活动提供了可乘之机。
    在治理整顿中，对这方面的问题不应忽视。企事业单位应通过自查，纠正私设帐外资金、违反财经纪律的问题；对于那些不是自查，而是被查出的问题，则应从严处理，该没收的没收，该罚款的罚款，对有关当事人和领导，也应依法追究责任。这样，方能抑制帐外资金的泛滥，严格财经制度，管好用好资金。
