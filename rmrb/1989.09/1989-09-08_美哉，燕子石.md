Swallow Stone, what a beautiful name.

In the "Beautiful Hometown" National Folk Customs Photography Art Contest, each winning author received a unique prize—a trophy and inkstone made from Langya Swallow Stone.

This was the first time I had seen such exquisite stones. On the grayish-yellow stone slabs, small swallows seem to be carved in relief, flying gracefully. This natural art treasure is truly exquisite, with beauty that speaks for itself and reaches its peak.

According to the secretary-general of the contest committee, this Swallow Stone, also known as Bat Stone, is produced in the Linyi region of Shandong Province. Swallow Stone is an ancient fossil—trilobite fossil. Trilobites are marine animals that evolved during the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era and became extinct by the Mesozoic era. Approximately five billion years ago, in the vast ocean, they were the only living creatures, with tens of thousands of species. Because their bodies can be divided into three segments, they are called trilobites. Later, due to the movement of the earth's crust, they were embedded in grayish-yellow green stone slabs. The trilobites turned into fossils but still appear vividly, in a scattered yet orderly manner, like swallows in flight and butterflies taking off, preserving the beautiful posture of life in its final moments.

Swallow Stone is not only a physical record for studying the history of the Earth and the evolution of life but also a unique material for carving, cherished by scholars and literati throughout the ages. As early as the Jin Dynasty, the scholar Guo Pu mentioned in his commentary on the "Erya" that "Bat is also known as Ink Recognizer." He also noted that people from Qi used Bat Stone to make inkstones, calling them "Ink Recognizer Inkstones." The "Xiqing Inkstone Catalog," compiled by the Qing Dynasty imperial court, lists Swallow Stone inkstones as the first entry.

The Swallow Stone in Fei County and other areas of the Linyi region is abundant, with fine texture and vibrant colors. The swallows are clear and lifelike, making it an excellent material for carving and a wonderful item for appreciation. Inkstones made from Swallow Stone are delicate and smooth, feeling like congealed fat when touched, and sounding like bells when tapped. They also retain water well and produce ink without damaging the brush. Various stationery items made from this stone, such as pen holders, paperweights, ink slabs, ink washers, seals, and seal paste boxes, are also elegant and interesting, skillfully using natural materials in a way that is wonderfully indescribable.

In 1979, Swallow Stone products from Fei County were exhibited in Beijing along with Lu inkstones, attracting widespread attention from people in various circles. Contemporary calligraphers and painters wrote inscriptions: Wu Zuoren inscribed "奇观" (Marvelous Sight), and Li Kuchan inscribed "惜南埠未见" (Regretting Not Seeing It in the South), giving high praise to the Swallow Stone.

    美哉，燕子石
    葛海霞
    燕子石，好美的名字。
    在《家乡美》全国风情摄影艺术大奖赛中，参赛的获奖作者每人得到了一份别致的奖品——用琅琊燕子石制成的奖杯、石砚。
    我第一次见到这么精美的石头，灰黄色的石板上浮雕般地嵌满了翩跹飞翔的小燕子，这天然的艺术佳品堪称美好绝伦，真可谓美在不言中，美在极尽处。
    据这次大奖赛的组委会秘书长介绍说，这种燕子石，又名蝙蝠石，出产于山东省临沂地区。燕子石是一种古生物化石——三叶虫化石。三叶虫系海栖动物，衍生在古生代的寒武纪，至中生代灭亡。远在大约五亿年以前，浩瀚的大海里，它们是唯一的生物，家族不下万种，因其虫体可分为三节，所以叫三叶虫。后来，由于地壳的变动，才将它们镶嵌在灰黄色的青石板上。三叶虫变成了化石，却依旧跃然纷呈，错落有致，如燕子竟飞，蝴蝶起舞，保留了生命最后一瞬的美好姿态。
    燕子石不仅是研究地球历史和生物进化的实物资料，而且也是一种独具天趣的雕刻良材，历代不少文人墨客曾用此石制砚。早在晋代，文学家郭璞在注释《尔雅》时就有“蝙蝠又名识墨”的记载。他还提到齐人曾以蝙蝠石制砚，称之为“识墨砚”。清代皇家编撰之《西清砚谱》上，把燕子石砚列为首篇。
    临沂地区费县等地的燕子石蕴藏比较丰富，石质细腻、色彩鲜艳，燕子清晰、栩栩如生，是雕刻之佳材，观赏之妙品。用燕子石制砚，姿质嫩润，抚之如凝脂，叩之如钟磬，且滴水不干，发墨而不损毫。用此石制作的笔筒、镇纸、墨床、笔洗、印章、印泥盒等文房诸宝也是古雅多趣，巧用天工，妙不可言。
    一九七九年费县的燕子石产品曾随鲁砚进京展览，引起各界人士的广泛注意。当代书画家纷纷题词：吴作人题“奇观”二字，李苦禅题“惜南埠未见”，给予燕子石高度的赞誉。
