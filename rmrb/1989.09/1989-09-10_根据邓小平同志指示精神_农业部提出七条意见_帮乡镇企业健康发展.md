According to the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the Ministry of Agriculture has proposed seven measures to promote the healthy development of township enterprises.

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 9 (Reporters Jiaoran, Zhang Yinshu) Vice Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang today at the publicity and education meeting on rural policies held by the Propaganda Department, hoped that reporters would convey to township enterprise operators in various places that the country's policy towards township enterprises is not to eliminate them, but to close down those that waste electricity, raw materials, pollute the environment, and have poor efficiency during the rectification and reorganization.

Chen Yaobang introduced that at present, there are more than 18.8 million township enterprises nationwide. Last year, they paid 31 billion yuan in taxes to the state and earned 6.5 billion yuan in foreign exchange. At the same time, they solved the employment problem for nearly 100 million people in the agricultural sector. In terms of output value, township enterprises account for "one-fourth" of the national economy, with an output value of 649.5 billion yuan last year. However, since township enterprises are established by farmers who lack knowledge of large-scale industrial production, many places have experienced blind development, resulting in irrational industrial and product structures. Some enterprises have poor management, leading to waste of energy and raw materials, severe pollution, and low product quality. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out: "For those township enterprises that waste electricity and raw materials, a batch must be resolutely closed down, and actions must be resolute." Chen Yaobang said that the Ministry of Agriculture, in accordance with this spirit, has proposed seven measures to correctly guide the healthy development of township enterprises.

1. Appropriately reduce the development speed of township enterprises to match the national economy, rural economy, and the enterprise's own capacity, and coordinate with the development of state-owned industries and agriculture.

2. Reduce the scale of basic construction and strictly control new projects. In the next three years, except for export-oriented enterprises, agricultural and sideline product processing enterprises with guaranteed raw materials, enterprises developing energy and raw materials, enterprises providing supporting cooperation for large-scale industries, and enterprises producing goods in short supply for people's livelihood, all other enterprises must stop or delay their projects.

3. Existing enterprises should actively adjust according to the national industrial policy and local specific conditions. Those enterprises that waste electricity and raw materials, have products that do not meet standards or lack production permits, severely pollute the environment and cannot be treated in the short term, lack guaranteed raw materials, have poor management, and have long-term losses must be resolutely closed down.

4. Further improve the contract responsibility system for township enterprises, strengthen technological transformation, improve enterprise management, and ensure that the main indicators of material consumption, product quality, and capital efficiency of township backbone enterprises with an output value of over 10 million yuan reach the level of state-owned enterprises in the same industry.

5. Carry out the "double increase and double save" campaign, rationally distribute and use enterprise profits, resolutely reduce non-production construction projects and non-production expenditures within the enterprise, and increase enterprise self-accumulation.

6. Adjust the enterprise structure, guide enterprises to take the path of small but specialized, high-level socialized cooperation production, and avoid low-level repetitive production as much as possible.

7. Strengthen political and ideological work among township enterprise employees, insist on building both material and spiritual civilization, abide by laws and regulations, and resolutely correct all improper practices.

    根据邓小平同志指示精神
　　农业部提出七条意见
　　帮乡镇企业健康发展
    新华社北京9月9日电　（记者焦然、张银曙）农业部副部长陈耀邦今天在中宣部召开的农村政策宣传座谈会上，希望记者向各地乡镇企业经营者转告，国家对乡镇企业的方针不是要砍掉乡镇企业，而是要在治理整顿中，关掉那些浪费电力、原材料、污染环境、效益差的乡镇企业。
    陈耀邦介绍，目前全国已有1880多万家乡镇企业，去年向国家纳税310亿元，创汇65亿元，同时还解决了近1亿农业人口的就业问题。从产值上看，乡镇企业在国民经济中已是“四分天下有其一”，去年创产值6495亿元。但是，乡镇企业是由缺乏大工业生产知识的农民创办的，因而许多地方出现盲目发展，致使产业结构、产品结构不合理；一些企业经营管理不善，造成能源、原材料浪费、污染严重，产品质量也低劣。因此，邓小平同志不久前指出：“对那些浪费电力和原材料的乡镇企业，要坚决关一批，行动要坚决。”陈耀邦说，农业部根据这一精神，提出了正确引导乡镇企业健康发展的七条意见。
    一、适当降低乡镇企业的发展速度，使之与国家、农村经济、企业自身承受能力相适应，与国营工业和农业发展相协调。
    二、压缩基本建设规模，严格控制新上项目。今后3年内，除外向型企业、有原料保证的农副产品加工企业、发展能源和原材料的企业、为大工业配套协作的企业、为人民生活服务生产市场紧缺商品的企业外，其他企业一律要停上或缓上。
    三、现有企业要根据国家产业政策，结合当地具体情况，积极主动地进行调整。要坚决砍掉那些浪费电力和原材料的企业，产品质量达不到标准、没有生产许可证的企业，污染严重、一时无法治理的企业和原材料无保证、经营不善、长期亏损的企业。
    四、进一步完善乡镇企业经营承包责任制，加强技术改造，搞好企业管理，使产值在百万元以上的乡村骨干企业物质消耗、产品质量、资金效益主要指标达到同行业国营企业水平。
    五、开展双增双节活动，搞好企业内部利润合理分配和使用，坚决压缩企业非生产性建设项目和非生产性开支，增加企业自身积累。
    六、调整企业结构，引导企业走小而专、高水平的社会化协作生产道路，尽量避免小而专的低水平上的重复生产。
    七、加强乡镇企业职工的政治思想工作，坚持物质文明建设和精神文明建设同时抓，遵纪守法，坚决纠正各种不正之风。
