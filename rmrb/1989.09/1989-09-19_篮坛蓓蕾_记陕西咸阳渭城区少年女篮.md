Before the first match of the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship, 16 young female basketball players from Weicheng District, Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, performed a unique basketball routine, which attracted great interest from the audience and basketball experts present.

The children, stepping to a lively rhythm, combined music, dance, skills, and basic techniques, presenting a lively and lovable image with smooth and natural movements.

The youth girls' basketball team was established in September 1984. They were selected from 25 basketball enthusiasts from five primary and secondary schools in Xianyang City. The youngest is only 8 years old, and the oldest is 14 years old, with an average height of 1.65 meters. Under the meticulous guidance of coaches Ma Yufeng and Qiao Shulin, the team members utilize their spare time and holidays to train in basic skills. The two coaches, combining the characteristics of the young players, compiled a training program from easy to difficult, implemented in stages, and achieved good results.

During the growth process of this small basketball team, they received strong support from all sectors of society and leaders at all levels. Famous coaches in China, such as Qian Chenghai, Sun Bang, and Wu Xin, also demonstrated and guided the team members during their matches in Xi'an and Xianyang. All of these further inspired the children's spirit of striving for progress. In nearly two years of more than 30 matches, the team has maintained an undefeated record. Recently, in the Shaanxi Provincial Youth Girls' Basketball Competition, they won the championship and also received the Sports Moral and Etiquette Award.

　　篮坛蓓蕾
　　——记陕西咸阳渭城区少年女篮
    在第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛首场比赛之前，由陕西省咸阳市渭城区16名苗苗女篮队员表演了一场别开生面的篮球操，引起了观众和在场篮球专家们的极大兴趣。
    孩子们踏着欢快的节拍，把音乐、舞蹈、技巧、基本功融为一体，形象活泼可爱，动作娴熟自如。
    这支苗苗女篮组建于1984年9月。他们是从咸阳市区5所中小学挑选的25名篮球爱好者，年龄最小的只有8岁，最大的14岁，平均身高1.65米。在教练马宇飞、乔树林的精心指导下，队员们利用课余和节假日，开展基本功训练。这两位老师结合小队员的特点，自编了一套训练方案，由易到难，分段实施，收到很好的效果。
    这支小篮球队在成长的过程中，得到社会各界和各级领导的大力支持。我国著名教练钱澄海、孙邦和吴忻水等率队在西安、咸阳比赛时，也分别向队员们做示范指导。所有这些都更加激励了孩子们奋发向上的精神。在近两年的30多次比赛中，这个队始终保持着不败的纪录。不久前，在陕西省少年女篮比赛中，她们一举夺魁，并荣获体育道德风尚奖。
