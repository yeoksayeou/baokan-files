United Nations, September 13 (Xinhua) — Reporter Li Kai Chen reports: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar issued a statement today condemning the assassination of SWAPO Political Bureau member Anton Lubowski.

Lubowski, a white lawyer, was 37 years old. He joined SWAPO in 1984 and served as the organization's unofficial spokesperson and liaison officer during the current election campaign, being the only white member in the SWAPO leadership. He was shot and killed by assailants at his home in the outskirts of Windhoek yesterday. The perpetrators are still at large.

De Cuéllar stated that he was deeply shocked by the assassination of Lubowski at a time when Namibia's election campaign was underway.

De Cuéllar strongly urged all parties concerned to halt any actions that could further exacerbate the situation and urged the South African administrator responsible for maintaining law and order in Namibia to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the leaders of all Namibian political parties.

	Beijing, September 14 (Xinhua) — The Organization of African Unity (OAU) issued a statement from Addis Ababa on September 13, expressing shock and outrage over the assassination of SWAPO Political Bureau member Anton Lubowski on September 12, and holding the South African authorities responsible for the incident.

	The statement described Lubowski as a victim of South African machinations and called on the United Nations to redouble its efforts to ensure that the South African authorities and their agents stop such wanton killings and violence.

	Meanwhile, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda also expressed great shock and sorrow over the assassination. He condemned South Africa and its agents in Namibia as the masterminds behind the murder and believed that the blood of Lubowski and other martyrs who sacrificed their lives for Namibian independence would not be in vain.

	The United Nations Special Representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, also strongly condemned the assassination in a statement issued in Windhoek.

	He pointed out that according to United Nations Resolution 435, the South West African Police should fulfill their duties and conduct a thorough and speedy investigation into this act of terrorism.
