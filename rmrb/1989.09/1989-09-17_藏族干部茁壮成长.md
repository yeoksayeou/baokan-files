Tibetan cadres have grown and flourished since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially since the democratic reforms of 1959. Under the care of the Party, the cadre team composed mainly of Tibetan cadres has rapidly expanded. Currently, Tibetan cadres make up 64.23% of the total cadre workforce in the region.

During the peaceful liberation of Tibet, our Party cultivated the first batch of local Tibetan cadres. By the early period of the democratic reforms in 1959, there were 2,767 Tibetan cadres in the region, accounting for 30% of the total cadre workforce. To adapt to the new situation of democratic reforms and socialist construction, the Central Committee and the State Council paid great attention to the training of Tibetan cadres. Various levels of the Party organizations in Tibet followed the central instructions and took a series of measures: First, they recruited a batch of Tibetan cadres from society who had high political awareness, were young, and were proficient in both Tibetan and Chinese. They also selected a large number of Tibetan students from ethnic colleges to join the cadre ranks. Second, they established the Tibet Nationalities Institute and other colleges and universities, as well as various levels of party schools and vocational schools, to train ethnic cadres. Third, they opened the Central Party School Tibet Class to cultivate a considerable number of leading talents. Fourth, they sent a large number of comrades to study in relevant institutions in inland China. At the same time, in terms of admission and recruitment, they relaxed the conditions for Tibetans. By the end of 1988, Tibetan cadres accounted for 39%, 54.8%, 77.4%, and 94.5% of the total cadre workforce at the autonomous region, prefecture, county, and township levels, respectively. These ethnic cadres, under the leadership of various levels of Party committees, have always stood at the forefront of struggle and construction in different historical periods, making indelible contributions to maintaining national unity, strengthening ethnic unity, and the various construction causes in Tibet.

At the same time, the team of Tibetan professional and technical cadres has also rapidly expanded during this process. Currently, there are 14,542 professional and technical cadres of various types in the region, accounting for 56% of the total professional and technical cadre workforce. The team of Tibetan professional and technical cadres with relatively complete professional categories has initially taken shape.

　　藏族干部茁壮成长
    西藏和平解放以来，特别是1959年实行民主改革以来，民族干部队伍在党的关怀下迅速成长壮大。现在，以藏族干部为主体的全区干部队伍新格局已经形成，藏族干部已占全区干部总数的64.23％。
    在西藏和平解放过程中，我们党培养了第一批西藏的本民族干部。到1959年民主改革初期，全区有藏族干部2767人，占全区干部总数的30％。为了适应民主改革和社会主义建设的新形势，党中央和国务院十分重视藏族干部队伍的培养工作。西藏各级党组织遵照中央指示采取了一系列措施：一是在社会上吸收了一批具有较高政治觉悟、年纪轻、懂藏汉语的藏族干部；并从民族院校选定大批藏族学生加入到干部队伍行列。二是组建西藏民族学院等大专院校和各级党校、中专，培养民族干部。三是开办中央党校西藏班，培养了相当数量的领导人才。四是选派大批同志到内地有关院校深造。同时，在升学、招干等方面，对藏族放宽了条件。到1988年底，藏族干部已分别占自治区、地市、县区、乡镇四级干部总数的39％、54.8％、77.4％、94.5％。这些民族干部在各级党委的领导下，在各个历史时期，始终站在斗争和建设的前列，为维护祖国的统一、加强民族团结和西藏的各项建设事业，作出了不可磨灭的贡献。
    同时，藏族专业技术干部队伍在此过程中也得以迅速壮大。现在，全区各类专业技术干部达到14542名，占全区专业技术干部总数的56％。专业门类比较齐全的藏族专业技术干部队伍已初具规模。
