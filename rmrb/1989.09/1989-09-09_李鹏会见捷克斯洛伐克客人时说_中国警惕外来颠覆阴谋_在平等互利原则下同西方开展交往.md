Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th.

Premier Li Peng, when discussing China's engagement with the West, said today: "Closing the doors is not beneficial to our development, but relaxing vigilance is dangerous; in the future, we must handle these two aspects well."

Li Peng, while meeting with a delegation from the National Bank of Czechoslovakia led by Chairman Potac in the Zhongnanhai's Ziguang Pavilion, stated that China's policy of reform and opening up has not changed, and we will continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This includes engaging in economic, trade, and technological exchanges with Western countries on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, learning from their advanced technologies and management experiences according to China's needs, and introducing a certain amount of capital.

However, Li Peng pointed out: At the same time, we must be vigilant against the infiltration and subversion plots of certain Western countries.

During the meeting, Li Peng provided a detailed introduction to the domestic situation in China. He said that over the years, reform and opening up have achieved significant results—economic development, improved living standards for the people, and enhanced national strength; but there have also been issues such as total demand exceeding total supply and a relatively high inflation rate. He introduced that since last year, we have implemented an adjustment policy and taken a series of measures to rectify and regulate, achieving noticeable results. He pointed out that adjusting the economy is a very complex process, and we must be good at utilizing various means such as economic and legal measures.

He said that banks play an important role in this regard. For example, since last year, we have tightened credit, raised loan and deposit interest rates, and implemented value-preserving savings, which have significantly reduced the amount of currency in circulation, increased the amount of deposits, and played a good role in stabilizing the financial economy.

Li Peng said that China implements the principle of combining planned economy with market economy. The socialist system itself is superior, but its superiority has not been fully realized. The purpose of reform is to improve the socialist system, to mobilize the enthusiasm of the people to the greatest extent, and to further develop productive forces.

He pointed out that reform is not to change the socialist system itself. The view that China's reform is to implement a completely market economy and move towards private ownership is wrong.

During the meeting, Li Peng expressed his thanks to the Czechoslovakian Party, government, and people for their support when China encountered difficulties.

Potac said that Czechoslovakia and China have common interests and languages in maintaining the socialist system, therefore Czechoslovakia supports China's actions to suppress counter-revolutionary riots.

He said that the purpose of his visit this time is to personally understand the situation of China's reform and construction, and to discuss with Chinese counterparts the possibility of further strengthening cooperation.

State Councilor and Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, was present during the meeting.

    李鹏会见捷克斯洛伐克客人时说
    中国警惕外来颠覆阴谋
    在平等互利原则下同西方开展交往
    新华社北京9月9日电  （记者周树春）国务院总理李鹏今天在谈到中国同西方开展交往的问题时说：“关上大门对我们发展不利，放松警惕则是危险的；今后要处理好这两方面的关系。”
    李鹏在中南海紫光阁会见由行长波塔奇率领的捷克斯洛伐克国家银行代表团时说，中国改革开放的政策没有改变，并将一如既往地在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国发展友好合作关系，这包括同西方国家在平等互利的原则下开展经济、贸易和科技方面的交往，根据中国的需要学习它们的先进技术和管理经验，并引进一定的资金。
    但李鹏指出：与此同时，我们要对某些西方国家进行渗透和颠覆的阴谋保持警惕。
    会见时，李鹏详细介绍了中国国内情况。他说，这些年来改革开放取得了很大成就——经济发展了，人民生活水平提高了，国力增强了；但也出现了社会总需求超过总供给和通货膨胀率较高的问题。他介绍说：我们从去年开始实行调整政策，采取了一系列治理、整顿的措施，取得了明显成效。他指出，调整经济是一个很复杂的过程，要善于利用经济、立法等各种手段。
    他说，银行在这方面发挥着重要的作用。例如，去年开始紧缩银根，同时提高贷款和存款利率并实行保值储蓄等措施，使货币投放量大大减少，存款额上升，对稳定金融经济起到了良好的作用。
    李鹏说，中国实行计划经济同市场经济相结合的原则。社会主义制度本身是优越的，但其优越性没有充分发挥出来。改革的目的就是要完善社会主义制度，最大限度地调动人民群众的积极性，进一步发展生产力。
    他指出，改革不是要改变社会主义制度本身，那种认为中国改革就是要实行完全的市场经济、向私有制方向发展的看法是错误的。
    会见时，李鹏感谢捷克斯洛伐克党、政府和人民在中国遇到困难的时候给予的支持。
    波塔奇说，捷中两国在维护社会主义制度方面有共同的利益和语言，因此捷克斯洛伐克支持中国平息反革命暴乱的行动。
    他说，他此次来访目的是实地了解中国改革、建设的情况，并同中国同行探讨进一步加强合作的可能性。
    国务委员、中国人民银行行长李贵鲜会见时在座。
