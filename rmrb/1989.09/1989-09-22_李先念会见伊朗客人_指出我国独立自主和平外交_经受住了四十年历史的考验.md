Li Xiannian Meets with Iranian Guests
Points Out China's Independent and Peaceful Foreign Policy Has Withstood 40 Years of Historical Tests

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st - Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian said today that China's independent and peaceful foreign policy has withstood the test of 40 years of history.

	He made these remarks while meeting with the Iranian Islamic Delegation, led by Ayatollah Janati, Chairman of the Islamic Propaganda Organization, member of the Guardian Council, and member of the Assembly of Experts, in the Great Hall of the People. Li reaffirmed: China is willing to develop relations with all countries, including Western countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. However, China will never yield to any external pressure and will not allow any foreign country to interfere in China's internal affairs.

	When discussing some Western countries' economic "sanctions" against China, Li Xiannian said: "This may lead to two results. One is that the sanctioners will suffer the consequences themselves, losing the huge Chinese market. The other is that it will make us more determined to adhere to the principles of self-reliance, hard work, and frugal nation-building. Therefore, we are not afraid of sanctions."

	He said, "Some Westerners support so-called Chinese democrats, betting on them. I think they have placed their bet wrongly." China's struggle against external subversion and peaceful evolution is a long-term one.

	During the meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of Sino-Iranian relations in recent years.

    李先念会见伊朗客人
    指出我国独立自主和平外交
    经受住了四十年历史的考验
    据新华社北京9月21日电  政协全国委员会主席李先念今天会见伊朗客人时说，中国独立自主的和平外交政策经受住了40年历史的考验。
    他在人民大会堂会见以伊朗伊斯兰宣传组织主席、宪法监护委员会成员和专家会议成员阿亚图拉贾纳提为团长的伊朗伊斯兰代表团时重申：中国愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同包括西方国家在内的世界各国发展关系，但决不会屈服于任何外来压力，也不允许任何外国干涉中国内政。
    谈到一些西方国家对中国的经济“制裁”时，李先念说：这可能会带来两个结果，一是制裁者自食其果，失去中国这个巨大的市场；二是会使我们更坚定地奉行自力更生、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针。“所以，我们不怕制裁。”
    他说，一些西方人士支持所谓中国的民主斗士，“把宝押在他们身上，我看他们这一宝是押错了”。中国反对外来颠覆与和平演变的斗争是长期的。
    会见时，双方对近年中伊关系的发展表示满意。
