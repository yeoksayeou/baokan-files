Upon arriving in Tunxi, I heard that this area not only has the enchanting Yellow Mountains, distinctive Hui-style architecture, and the former residence of the great educator Tao Xingzhi, but also a famous "Old Street." This street is one of the most complete surviving Song Dynasty streets in China. The road is paved with blue stones, and there are ancient wooden pavilions with intricate carvings and painted beams. Flags and banners flutter, shops line the street, and crowds bustle about. Upon entering, one is reminded of the famous "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" painting.

That night, the four of us walked out of the Jiangxinzhou Hotel. The New An River flowed gently beside us, like a beautiful and gentle girl. Although there was no moonlight, the night in ancient Huizhou did not seem pitch-black.

What would the night scene on "Old Street" be like? I thought of the bustling night markets in Shenzhen and the lively Qinhuai River commercial street in Nanjing. Surely, "Old Street" would also be brightly lit at night?

However, "Old Street" greeted us with its tranquility. It was still early, but the street was already deserted. Most of the shops had closed their shutters, and light seeped out from the cracks. Some shutters, worn by time, had peeling paint, while others were freshly painted. The air was damp and heavy, and the thick night covered the wet blue stone path. The entire street was silent. The wooden buildings and green bricks, with their upturned eaves and flying roofs, sketched out a series of moving silhouettes against the dim night sky.

The night in Huizhou seemed to have come too early.

A friend who had been there during the day mentioned that there was an "Ruan Xiao'er Wine Shop" up ahead. Since it was a wine shop, it wouldn't close so early. Someone suggested we go in for a few bowls of yellow wine, perhaps to draw inspiration from the local spirits and compose some fine verses. But upon arrival, we found the wine shop had already closed, with only the "Ruan Xiao'er Wine Shop" flag fluttering in the night breeze under the eaves.

Exiting the street, the quietly flowing New An River appeared before us again. Across the river was the Jiangxinzhou Hotel where we were staying. The second-floor ballroom was in full swing, and a song floated in with the cool river breeze:

	"Outside the world is so wonderful,
		…"

After the song, the music's tempo suddenly quickened, and the jazz drums beat with such fervor that it made our blood boil. This music stirred the sleeping "Old Street" behind us, and the ancient yet beautiful New An River flowing beneath our feet. The thick night in ancient Huizhou seemed to be shattered by this modern drumbeat.

I couldn't help but reflect on my experiences during this trip to Huizhou. The ancient customs and modern civilization intertwined, making life so colorful. Our era's pace is quickening, and life will become even better…

    夜访“老街”
    朱建华
    初到屯溪，便听说这一带不仅有令人神往的黄山、独具特色的徽派建筑群和大教育家陶行知的故居，而且有一条驰名中外的“老街”。这条街是我国现存的最完整的宋代街道。青石板铺成的路面，古香古色的木制阁楼，雕梁画柱，旗幡招展，店铺林立，人群熙攘，进得街去一看，便会使你联想到宋代著名的“清明上河图”。
    那晚，我们一行四人，走出下榻的江心州宾馆。少女般柔美娴静的新安江在我们身边缓缓流过。虽没有月光，但这古徽州之夜并不令人感到漆黑。
      “老街”的夜晚该是怎样一番景色呢？我想起深圳夜市的繁华，南京古老的秦淮河商业街的灯火，“老街”的夜晚也一定灯火辉煌吧？
    然而，“老街”却以它的静寂迎接了我们这几个热情的寻访者。时间尚早，街面上便已空空如也。店铺大都上了门板，有灯光从板缝处溢出来，隐约可见有的门板因岁月久远油漆已脱落，有的则是油饰一新。空气潮湿而凝重，浓浓的夜色铺在湿漉漉的青石路上，整条街巷空寂无声。木楼青砖，翘角飞檐，在暗淡的夜空中勾画出一幅幅动人的剪影。
    徽州的夜在这里似乎过早地浓稠了。
    同行的一位朋友白天已经来过，说前边有一个“阮小二酒店”。既是酒店，一定不会这样早就关张。有人便提议到店里喝它几碗黄酒，看能不能借此地灵气吟出几句佳句来。可近前一看，酒店早已打烊，只有插在屋檐儿下的那面“阮小二酒店”杏黄旗在夜空摇荡。
    走出街口，静静流淌的新安江又横在我们眼前，对岸便是下榻的江心州宾馆，二楼大厅的一个舞会正进行到高潮，一支歌曲随润凉的江风飘进耳朵：
      “外面的世界很精采，
        ……”
    歌罢，音乐节奏骤然加快，爵士鼓敲得人热血沸腾。这乐曲激荡着我们身后的那条沉睡的“老街”，激荡着从我们脚下潺潺流淌的古老而美丽的新安江，这浓稠的古徽州的夜色也似乎被这现代鼓乐声击碎了。
    我不禁想到这几回徽州之行的感受，古朴的乡风与现代文明交织在一起，生活是这般色彩斑斓。我们的时代脚步正在加快，生活也将变得更美好……
