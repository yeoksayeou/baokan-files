The International Development Bank recently released an annual report stating that in 1988, the total external debt of Latin American countries decreased from $441 billion in 1987 to $426 billion, a reduction of $15 billion. The overall export volume of the region also increased, but per capita production decreased. The economic and debt situations in Latin American countries are facing new severe challenges.

The annual report titled "1988 Economic and Social Progress in Latin America" points out that the reduction in debt last year was the first since 1960. The main reasons are that some major debtor countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Chile converted part of their debt into bonds, while other countries like Venezuela increased their repayment amounts.

The report emphasizes that although the implementation of the "Brady Plan" will reduce Mexico's debt by 35% this year, the overall debt of the Latin American region will not show a downward trend. On the contrary, from the first quarter of 1988 to the first quarter of this year, international debt interest rates have risen by three percentage points, meaning that the annual interest payment for Latin American countries has increased by one-third. Since 1982, Latin American countries have been paying an average of $20 billion in interest annually.

The report indicates that due to the heavy debt burden, the economic development of Latin American and Caribbean countries has been severely affected. In 1988, the average domestic production growth rate was only 0.6%. Considering the population growth factor, the per capita production actually decreased by 1.5%. Currently, many countries are facing a series of problems such as reduced investment inflows, decreased reserves, increased unemployment, worsening inflation, and rising fiscal deficits. The report predicts that in the coming year, the economic growth rate may be the same as or lower than last year, with a growth index of 0. Considering factors such as inflation, reduced investment, and the payment of $2.5 billion in interest, the actual economic growth index will be negative 2.2%.

　　国际开发银行发表年度报告
　　拉美经济面临新考验
    国际开发银行最近发表的一份年度报告说，一九八八年拉美国家的外债总额从一九八七年的四千四百一十亿美元减至四千二百六十亿美元，即减少了一百五十亿美元，整个地区的出口额也有所增长，但人均产值下降，拉美国家的经济和债务面临新的严峻局势。
    这份题为“一九八八年拉丁美洲经济和社会进程”的年度报告指出，去年拉美国家债务额减少，这是一九六○年以来的第一次，其原因主要是一些大的债务国如巴西、墨西哥和智利把一部分债额转换成了债券，另一些国家如委内瑞拉扩大了还债额。
    报告强调，今年尽管由于推行“布雷迪计划”将使墨西哥的债务减少百分之三十五，但整个拉美地区的债务总额不可能再出现下降趋势。相反，自一九八八年第一季度至今年第一季度，国际债务利率上涨了三个百分点，这意味着拉美国家年利息的支付额增加三分之一。自从一九八二年以来，拉美国家每年平均支付的债息达二百亿美元。
    这份年度报告材料说明，拉美和加勒比国家由于债务负担过重，经济发展受到严重影响，一九八八年国内生产增长率平均只达百分之○点六，如果加上人口增长因素，人均产值实际下降了百分之一点五。目前，很多国家面临新的投资流入减少、储备下降、失业和通货膨胀加剧、财政赤字上升等一系列问题。报告预测，在新的一年内经济增长率可能与去年相同或者更低，增长指数为○，加上通货膨胀因素、投资减少和支付二百五十亿美元的债息，实际的经济增长指数将是负百分之二点二。
