After 40 years of construction, a thriving phosphorus chemical industry town—Kunyang Phosphorus Mine—has emerged on the southern shore of Dian Lake in Kunming. Surrounding this town are China's largest phosphorus mining operations and the largest phosphorus fertilizer and phosphorus chemical plants. The annual total output value of the phosphorus chemical industry has reached approximately 726 million yuan.

Yunnan is an important phosphorus mining region in China. The proven phosphorus reserves alone amount to 8.7 billion tons, with high grades, easy extraction, low production costs, and minimal investment, giving it a unique advantage in the national phosphorus mining industry. Reform has enabled the phosphorus chemical industry to take off. Since 1982, the first 100,000-ton high-concentration phosphorus fertilizer plant in China, Yunnan Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant, has begun to achieve good economic benefits. In 1984, the largest yellow phosphorus production plant in the country, and also the largest sodium tripolyphosphate production plant in the country—Kunming Sodium Tripolyphosphate Plant—was officially put into production. The completion of these two plants marks the significant strides Yunnan's phosphorus chemical industry has made from the mining and low-level utilization of phosphorus ore to deep and comprehensive utilization. Statistics show that during the 10 years of reform and opening up, the phosphorus chemical industry has developed at an average annual growth rate of 7.5%. By the end of 1988, the province had 24 large and small phosphorus mines and 28 various phosphorus fertilizer plants; annual production of phosphorus ore was 3.23 million tons, yellow phosphorus 31,000 tons, sodium tripolyphosphate 65,000 tons, and various phosphorus fertilizers exceeded 1.6 million tons.

In 1986, Yunnan's yellow phosphorus and phosphorus fertilizers were exported to Japan, Southeast Asia, and other countries and regions, making Yunnan's chemical industry exports exceed the $10 million mark for the first time, reaching $12.51 million.

Currently, the state has listed the development of the Kunming Dian Lake Phosphorus Mine in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Relevant departments have proposed to build a large-scale phosphorus chemical base facing the entire country by the year 2000. The annual phosphorus mining scale will reach 15 million tons, producing high-concentration phosphorus fertilizers and compound fertilizers totaling 2.3 million tons, and yellow phosphorus at over 300,000 tons. A new phosphorus chemical comprehensive city will stand on the shores of Dian Lake.

    欣欣向荣的云南磷化工
    经过40年的建设，一座欣欣向荣的磷化工小城——昆阳磷矿出现在昆明滇池南端。在这座小城周围，散布着我国最大的磷矿开采业和最大的磷肥厂和磷化工厂，磷化工年总产值已达到7.26亿元左右。
    云南是我国磷矿的重要产区，现已探明的磷矿储量就有87亿吨，品位高，易开采，生产成本低，投资少，在全国磷矿开采中具有特别优势。改革使磷化工开始了腾飞。1982年以后，我国第一家年产10万吨高浓度磷肥的云南磷肥厂开始收到较好的经济效益；1984年，全国最大的黄磷生产厂，也是全国最大的三聚磷酸钠生产厂——昆明三聚磷酸钠厂正式投入生产。这两个工厂的建成，标志着云南磷化工已从磷矿石的开采和低级利用向深度、综合利用迈开了大步。据统计，改革开放的10年中，磷化工每年以平均递增7.5％的速度向前发展。截至1988年末，全省大小磷矿24座，各种磷肥厂28个；年产磷矿石323万吨，黄磷3.1万吨，三聚磷酸钠6.5万吨，各种磷肥超过160万吨。
    1986年，云南的黄磷、磷肥等磷化工产品远销日本、东南亚等国家和地区，使云南的化工创汇第一次突破千万美元大关，达到1251万美元。
    现在，国家已将昆明滇池磷矿开发列入“七五”计划，有关部门提出在2000年前建成一个面向全国的大型磷化工基地，磷矿年开采规模将达到1500万吨，生产出高浓度磷肥及复合化肥230万吨，黄磷30多万吨。一个新的磷化工综合城将屹立于滇池之滨。
