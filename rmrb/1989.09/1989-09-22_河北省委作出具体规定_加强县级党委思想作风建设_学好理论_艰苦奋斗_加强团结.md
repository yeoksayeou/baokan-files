    The Hebei Provincial Party Committee Issues Specific Regulations to Strengthen the Ideological and Work Style Construction of County-Level Party Committees
    Study Theory, Strive Hard, Strengthen Unity

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Guoqing and Yu Shaoliang report from Shijiazhuang: The Hebei Provincial Party Committee recently decided to strengthen the ideological and work style construction of county-level local party committees.

    A county is a relatively independent economic unit. The ideological and work style of county-level local party committees directly affects the implementation of various policies and directives from the central government. From February to August this year, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee conducted a comprehensive investigation and research on the current situation of 175 county (district) party committees in the province. It was found that the majority of the county-level party committee leadership teams are good, but some leadership teams have various problems in their ideological and work style, notably the tendency to substitute work for study, often getting bogged down in busy economic affairs, neglecting the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and the improvement of their own decision-making capabilities. In their work, there is a widespread phenomenon of being strong in one aspect and weak in another. Some teams lack unity; some are not clean and do not have the courage to stand up against corruption. This situation seriously affects and damages the overall image and fighting capacity of the Party.

    In response to the above problems, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee decided to take strengthening the ideological and work style construction of county-level local party committees as an important part of strengthening Party building work in the entire province and to grasp it firmly. On the basis of widely soliciting opinions, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee issued regulations on strengthening the ideological and work style construction of county-level local party committees. The "regulations" require that county-level local party committees first of all seriously study Marxist theory to improve the theoretical level of the leadership. Each standing committee member should ensure at least two days of political theory study time per month. Currently, the focus should be on studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and on learning and improving the ability to analyze and solve problems using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. Secondly, county-level local party committees should maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and struggle, and regard clean governance and anti-corruption as a long-term task in strengthening their own construction. They should voluntarily accept the supervision of the discipline inspection commission at the same level and Party members and the masses outside the Party. Thirdly, strengthen unity and strive to build the county-level party committee into a strong leadership core that is politically firm, ideologically united, clean and upright, and innovative and pragmatic. In addition, the "regulations" also put forward specific requirements for the degree of democratization of party life within county-level local party committees, as well as for adhering to seeking truth from facts and maintaining close ties with the masses.

    It is reported that this approach of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee has been affirmed by the central organizational departments. Many county committee leaders said that the "regulations" are easy to operate and supervise; they have targets and requirements, as well as measures and methods. They expressed their willingness to implement them seriously.

    河北省委作出具体规定
    加强县级党委思想作风建设
    学好理论　艰苦奋斗　加强团结
    本报石家庄9月21日电  本报记者陈国琦、新华社记者于绍良报道：中共河北省委日前作出决定，切实加强县级地方党委思想作风建设。
    一个县是一个相对独立的经济单元。县级地方党委思想作风状况如何，直接影响着中央各项方针、政策的贯彻落实。今年2月至8月，中共河北省委先后对全省175个县（区）党委的现状进行了全面调查研究，发现县级党委领导班子绝大多数是好的，但也有部分领导班子在思想作风上存在着这样那样的问题，突出的是以干代学，平时陷入忙忙碌碌的经济事务中，忽视了马列主义理论的学习和自身决策水平的提高；在工作中普遍存在“一手硬，一手软”的现象；有的班子不团结；有的自身不廉洁，不敢挺起腰杆同腐败现象作斗争。这种状况，严重影响和损害了党的整体形象和战斗力。
    针对以上问题，中共河北省委决定把加强县级地方党委思想作风建设作为加强全省党建工作的重要一环，抓紧抓好。在广泛征求意见的基础上，河北省委作出了加强县级地方党委思想作风建设的规定。“规定”要求，县级地方党委首先要认真学习马克思主义理论，提高领导成员的理论水平。常委每月至少要保证两天的政治理论学习时间。当前重点学好党的十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志重要讲话，学会和提高用马克思主义立场、观点、方法分析、解决问题的能力。其次，县级地方党委要保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，把廉洁勤政，反对腐败作为加强自身建设的一项长期任务来抓，自觉接受同级纪委和党内外群众的监督。第三，加强团结，努力把县级党委建设成政治坚定、思想统一、廉洁奉公、创新务实的坚强领导核心。此外，“规定”还对县级地方党委党内生活民主化程度以及坚持实事求是、密切联系群众等方面提出了具体要求。
    据悉，河北省委的这一做法，受到了中央组织部门的肯定。不少县委领导同志说，“规定”便于操作，易于监督；有目标要求，又有措施办法。他们表示要认真贯彻执行。
