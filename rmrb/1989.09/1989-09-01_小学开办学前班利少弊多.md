Title: Primary Schools Opening Pre-school Classes: More Harms Than Benefits

According to investigations, starting from the late 1970s, primary schools in major cities of provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu began to open pre-school classes, specifically enrolling children aged 5 to 6. At that time, this helped to alleviate the difficulty of finding childcare in cities and helped children familiarize themselves with and adapt to the school environment, playing a certain positive role. However, as the coverage of kindergartens in cities continues to expand and preschool education deepens, the continuation of pre-school classes by primary schools is increasingly showing obvious drawbacks.

Firstly, it is not conducive to the healthy growth of pre-school children. From the situation in cities like Jinan, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, some pre-school classes have poor facilities, lack of play and teaching materials, and poor conditions. During lunch, children can only sleep on desks and lie on benches. Schools that do not provide lunch for children can only let them go home twice a day. Since 5 to 6-year-old pre-school children have relatively poor self-protection abilities, incidents of falls and injuries often occur. Schools only "teach" and do not "protect," making it difficult for children to bear the physical and psychological burdens. Some children, after attending school for a few days, have to be sent back to kindergartens by their parents.

Secondly, it increases the economic and psychological burden on parents. Some units have incorrect educational ideas, treating pre-school classes as a "third industry" and a major means of increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Most of them charge relatively high fees. In addition to paying a certain amount of enrollment fee, each child pays between 40 to 50 yuan per month, with some paying as much as 60 to 70 yuan. Some schools even require children to bring their own mops, brooms, and small stools from home. Most schools also strictly require that children who do not attend the pre-school class in the school will not be admitted upon enrollment, leaving many parents with no choice but to comply.

Thirdly, it disrupts the normal teaching routine of kindergartens. Since primary schools "take away" 5 to 6-year-old children, kindergartens lose their large class educational objects, affecting the normal development of preschool education and causing the entire preschool education mechanism to have a gap. Especially in kindergartens with fewer enrolled children, they have to conduct mixed-class teaching, making it difficult to guarantee the quality of education. In summary, the opening of pre-school classes by primary schools in large and medium-sized cities only benefits the schools, while children, parents, and kindergartens are all affected. We appeal to relevant departments to pay attention to this issue and change this practice.

    小学开办学前班利少弊多
    据调查了解，从70年代末开始，山东、河南、江苏等省大中城市的小学相继开办了儿童学前班，专门招收5至6岁的儿童入学。这在当时对缓解城市入托难，为儿童熟悉、适应入学环境等，起了一定的积极作用。但是，随着城市幼儿园覆盖面的不断扩大和幼儿教育深入发展，小学再继续开办学前班，越来越显出明显弊端。
    一是不利于学龄前儿童身心健康成长。从济南、郑州、青岛、徐州等地开办学前班的情况看，有的设备简陋，缺乏玩教具，办学条件差。中午，孩子休息，只能睡课桌，躺板凳。不给孩子开午餐的小学，一天只好放两次“羊”。由于5至6岁的学龄前儿童自我保护能力还比较差，摔伤、碰伤的现象时有发生。学校只“教”不“保”，孩子们在生理和心理上都难以承受。有些孩子上了几天学后，家长又不得不把他们再次送入幼儿园。
    二是加重了家长的经济和心理负担。有些单位办学思想不端正，把学前班视为“第三产业”，作为增收节支的主要途径，大多数收费较高。除入学时需交一定数额的开班费外，每人每月少则40至50元，多则60至70元。有的连拖把、扫帚、小板凳等也都由儿童自己从家里带。大多数学校还硬性规定，凡不在本校学前班学习的孩子，入学时不予录取，使得许多家长有苦难言。
    三是打乱了幼儿园教育教学常规。由于小学把5至6岁的孩子“拉走”了，幼儿园就失去了大班的教育对象，影响了幼儿教育的正常发展，致使整个学前教育机制出现了断层。尤其是入托孩子少的园，不得不搞混合班教学，教育质量难以保证。综上所述，大中城市小学开办学前班，唯有小学一方得利，而儿童、家长、幼儿园三方都受到影响。吁请有关部门引起重视，改变这种做法。
