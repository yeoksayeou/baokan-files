Sixty senior comrades who joined the revolutionary work before the Anti-Japanese War gathered in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon to discuss strengthening party building with central leaders.

Song Ping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, said at the symposium that senior comrades are familiar with the party's fine traditions and style, and have accumulated rich experience in long-term party work and ideological and political work. It is very beneficial for our party's work to carry forward the advantages of senior comrades. The central authorities hope that senior comrades will continue to contribute, fully utilizing their advantages in their familiar fields, to strengthen party building, promote reform and opening up, and achieve modernization.

Deng Jianhua, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Wen Jiabao, a candidate member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee's Organization Department, Luogan, Secretary of the State Council and Secretary of the Central State Organs Work Committee, Zhou Keyu, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and Deputy Ministers of the Organization Department Zhao Zongnai, Lü Feng, and Meng Liankun, discussed with the senior comrades.

Wen Jiabao, who presided over the symposium, praised the senior comrades for their great contributions in both the founding of the People's Republic and the socialist revolutionary and construction work after the founding. He hoped that the senior comrades would offer more valuable opinions and suggestions on party building.

Senior comrades who spoke at the meeting included Wang Guangwei, former Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission, Yang Zhiqian, former Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, Xu Shengji, former Deputy Commander of the Beijing Military Region, Zhang Botao, former Deputy Director of the Discipline Inspection Group of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, and Wang Yuting, former Director of the Organization Bureau of the Organization Department.

They mentioned in their speeches that due to Zhao Ziyang's leadership during his tenure as the head of the central work, the party's leadership was weakened, and bourgeois liberalization was rampant. International hostile forces did not give up their intention to destroy us, and some people within the country opposed the party's leadership and the socialist system, which led to the turmoil in the spring and summer and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. This severe political struggle tells us that we must strengthen party building, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up. We must resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization.

Some senior comrades mentioned that the party is the core force leading the socialist modernization construction. Party building is crucial. We need to educate the broad masses of party members on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, fine traditions, style, patriotism, hard work, party constitution, party principles, and the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. They believe that the current atmosphere for strengthening party building has arrived, and the broad masses of party members and the people hope that our party will be built better. We should seize this good opportunity to strengthen the ideological education of party members, improve the quality of 48 million party members, and play the vanguard and exemplary role of each party member and the political core and fighting fortress role of grassroots organizations.

Some senior comrades mentioned in their speeches that the central leadership collective, with Jiang Zemin as the core, selected by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, has been working hard on anti-corruption, anti-pornography, and the rectification of companies, which has been well-received by the people. They hope that the central authorities will continue to push these efforts to achieve greater results, which will also strongly promote party building work. They believe that to build a good party, we must govern the party strictly.

Some senior comrades mentioned that in the past, Liu Shaoqi's "On the Cultivation of a Communist" and other works by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries on party building have educated the whole party. They hope that relevant departments of the central authorities will consider compiling a "Must-Read for Party Members" to strengthen the ideological education of party members.

Many senior comrades who participated in the symposium expressed their determination to work with the younger comrades to shoulder the historical mission and play a role in party building work.

Song Ping spoke at the meeting. He first, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended holiday greetings and congratulations to the retired senior comrades present and, through them, to all retired senior comrades across the country.

Song Ping said that several senior comrades had just expressed good opinions on how to strengthen party building and ideological and political work and how to give full play to the advantages of senior comrades. The key to doing a good job in anti-corruption is to build a good party. The fundamental issue in building a good party is to strengthen the ideological education of the broad masses of party members and improve the quality of party members. As everyone just mentioned, we must govern the party strictly. Building a good party is a long-term and sustained effort and cannot be tight at one time and loose at another.

He said that our senior comrades, in the war years, worked hard and fearlessly sacrificed for the creation of New China. After the founding of the nation, they continued to carry forward the revolutionary fine traditions, worked hard and selflessly, and made great contributions to the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics in different positions. In recent years, senior comrades have successively retired from their leadership positions, but they still care about and are concerned about the party's work. According to their own strengths, they have provided suggestions and strategies for reform and opening up and modernization construction in various forms. Especially in adhering to and carrying forward the party's fine traditions and style, they have set a good example for the broad masses of party members and the people.

He said that in this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, the vast majority of senior comrades took a firm stand and a clear position, firmly supporting the Party Central Committee's decision to stop the turmoil and quell the rebellion, and their performance was very good. Although the situation at that time was very complex, many of our senior comrades acted in accordance with party nature, insisted on using Marxist-Leninist positions, viewpoints, and methods to analyze problems and judge right and wrong, guided relatives, children, and surrounding comrades to correctly view the situation, maintained the party's leadership, maintained the party's unity and stability, and maintained social stability. At the critical moment when the party and the country faced a life-and-death test, senior comrades played a very important role. The party and the people thank you.

Song Ping said that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed the urgent task of strengthening party building and ideological and political work, which reflects the common aspirations of the whole party. Senior comrades are very concerned about how to strengthen party building and ideological and political work. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently said, "We must concentrate on building the party. The party must be built, and it cannot be delayed any longer." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's words correctly assessed the situation of the party. This turmoil exposed the serious consequences of Zhao Ziyang's weakening of the party's leadership. In recent years, in the education of party members and cadres, the education of Marxist basic principles and party basic knowledge has been relaxed, and the party's fine traditions and style have rarely been mentioned, which has caused some comrades to lose their vigilance against the enemy's "peaceful evolution" conspiracy and the domestic enemy's and party's stubborn adherence to bourgeois liberalization to change the nature of the party and deny the party's fine traditions. Many senior comrades are worried and deeply concerned about this. But during Zhao Ziyang's tenure as General Secretary, many good suggestions from senior comrades to strengthen party building were not taken seriously, making senior comrades feel very frustrated.

He said that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the mood of senior comrades has improved, and they have actively proposed various suggestions to the party. At the symposium held by the Central Organization Department on July 1st this year, the senior comrades present proposed many good opinions on how to overcome the impact of Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, strengthen party building, and ideological and political work. These opinions have been absorbed into the drafting of the CPC Central Committee's notice on strengthening party building and other documents.

Song Ping said that the tasks facing us are very arduous and require the whole party to unite and strive hard. He hoped that senior comrades would, in their participation in various activities and work, give full play to their advantages, and definitely start from their own health conditions, act according to their abilities, and balance work and rest, taking good care of themselves.

Deng Jianhua thanked the senior comrades for their opinions and suggestions and wished them a happy holiday and good health.

This symposium was organized by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Central Committee's Organization Department, and the State Organs Work Committee.

    在中组部总政等四部门举办的座谈会上
    老同志语重心长话党建
    宋平说中央希望老同志发挥优势再立新功
    新华社北京9月27日电　（记者李尚志）60位抗日战争以前参加革命工作的老同志今天下午聚会在中南海怀仁堂，同中央领导同志一起座谈加强党的建设问题。
    中共中央政治局常委、中组部部长宋平在座谈会上说，老同志熟悉党的优良传统和作风，在长期的党务工作和思想政治工作中积累了丰富经验，发扬老同志的优势，对我们党的工作十分有利。中央希望老同志们老有所为，在各自熟悉的领域里，充分发挥自己的优势，为加强党的建设，促进改革开放和实现现代化再立新功。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云，中共中央书记处候补书记、中直工委书记温家宝，国务院秘书长、中央国家机关工委书记罗干，人民解放军总政治部副主任周克玉，中组部副部长赵宗鼐、吕枫、孟连昆，与老同志们一起进行了座谈。
    主持座谈会的温家宝赞扬老同志们无论在创建人民共和国时期，还是在建国后的社会主义革命建设事业中，都做出了巨大贡献，他希望老同志们就党的建设多多提出宝贵意见和建议。
    在会上先后发言的老同志有原国家计委副主任王光伟、原中共甘肃省委书记杨植霖、原北京军区副司令员徐深吉、原机电部纪检组副组长张伯涛、原中组部组织局局长王雨亭。
    他们在发言中谈到，由于赵紫阳同志在主持中央工作期间，淡化党的领导，削弱党的领导，放任资产阶级自由化的泛滥；国际敌对势力亡我之心不死；国内一些人反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度，所以出现了今年春夏之交的动乱和北京发生的反革命暴乱。这场严峻的政治斗争告诉我们，必须加强党的建设，必须坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放，必须坚决反对资产阶级自由化。
    有些老同志谈到，党是领导社会主义现代化建设事业的核心力量，党的建设至关重要。要对广大党员进行马列主义、毛泽东思想的教育，进行优良传统、作风的教育，进行爱国主义、艰苦奋斗的教育，进行党纲、党章等党的基本知识和共产主义理想的教育，进行全心全意为人民服务这个根本宗旨的教育。他们认为，当前抓好党的建设的大气候已经到来，广大党员和人民群众也希望我们的党建设得更好。我们应当抓住这个大好时机，抓紧对党员的思想教育，提高4800万党员的素质，发挥每个党员的先锋模范作用，发挥基层组织的政治核心作用、战斗堡垒作用。
    有的老同志在发言中说，十三届四中全会选出的以江泽民同志为核心的中央领导集体，抓反对腐败现象，抓扫黄，抓清理整顿公司等工作，大得人心，群众对此十分满意，说“照这样抓下去，我们的事业大有希望”。老同志们希望中央继续抓紧这些工作，取得更大成效，这也是对党建工作的有力促进。他们认为，要把党建设好，就必须从严治党。
    有的老同志说，过去，刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》和其他老一辈无产阶级革命家关于党的建设的论著，教育了全党同志，希望中央有关部门考虑编写一本《党员必读》，以加强对党员的思想教育。
    参加座谈的许多老同志表示，一定要同年轻的同志一道，肩负起历史使命，在党建工作中发挥作用。
    宋平在会上讲了话。他首先代表党中央、国务院向在座的离休老同志，并通过大家向全国离退休的老同志致以节日的问候和祝贺。
    宋平说，刚才有几位老同志就加强党的建设和思想政治工作中，如何发挥老同志的优势问题发表了很好的意见。搞好廉政建设的关键是把党建设好。搞好党的建设的根本问题是加强对广大党员的思想教育，提高党员素质。正如大家刚才讲的，一定要从严治党。搞好党的建设是长期的、持久的工作，绝不能时紧时松。
    他说，我们的老同志，在战争年代艰苦奋斗、不怕牺牲，为创建新中国立下了功绩。建国以后，继续发扬革命的优良传统，任劳任怨，在不同的岗位上为建设有中国特色的社会主义作出了巨大贡献。这些年，老同志们相继退出了领导岗位，但他们依然关心和牵挂着党的工作，根据自身的特长，以各种形式为改革开放和现代化建设献计献策。特别是在坚持和发扬党的优良传统和作风方面，为广大党员和人民群众树立了良好风范。
    他说，在这次动乱和首都发生反革命暴乱中，绝大多数老同志立场坚定、旗帜鲜明，坚决拥护党中央制止动乱、平息暴乱的决策，表现是很好的。虽然当时情况很复杂，但我们许多老同志凭党性办事，坚持用马列主义的立场、观点、方法分析问题，判断是非，引导亲属、子女及周围同志正确看待形势，维护党的领导、维护党的团结统一、维护社会的安定。在党和国家面临生死存亡考验的严峻关头，老同志起了很好、很重要的作用，党和人民感谢你们。
    宋平说，党的十三届四中全会提出了大力加强党的建设、加强思想政治工作的迫切任务，这反映了全党同志的共同心愿。老同志们对如何加强党的建设、加强思想政治工作是十分关心的。小平同志最近讲：“要聚精会神地抓党的建设，这个党该抓了，不抓不行了。”小平同志的这番话正确地估价了党的状况。这场风波暴露了赵紫阳同志淡化党的领导，削弱党的领导所造成的严重后果。这些年，在党员教育和干部教育中放松了马克思主义基本原理和党的基本知识的教育，党的优良传统和作风也很少讲了，致使一些同志对国际敌对势力搞“和平演变”的阴谋活动，对国内敌对分子、党内顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人妄图改变党的性质、否定党的优良传统的言论和行动失去应有的警觉。对此，许多老同志忧心忡忡、思虑深切。但在赵紫阳同志担任总书记期间，不少老同志要求加强党的建设的好建议没有受到重视，使得老同志感到很憋气。
    他说，党的十三届四中全会以后，老同志们的心情舒畅了，积极向党提出各种建议。今年“七·一”在中央组织部召开的座谈会上，与会的老同志就如何克服赵紫阳同志的错误所造成的影响，大力加强党的建设和思想政治工作提出了很多好的意见。这些意见在起草中共中央关于加强党的建设的通知等文件中都吸收进去了。
    宋平说，当前我们面临的任务十分繁重，需要全党同志同心同德、努力奋斗。他希望老同志们在参与各种活动、各项工作，发挥优势的过程中，一定要从各自的健康状况出发，量力而行，劳逸适度，多加珍重。
    田纪云对老同志们提出的意见和建议表示感谢，祝老同志们节日愉快，身体健康。
    这次座谈会是中共中央组织部、人民解放军总政治部、中直工委、国家机关工委举办的。
