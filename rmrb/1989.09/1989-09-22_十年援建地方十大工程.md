    After a series of adjustments and reforms, China has formed a national defense reserve force system with Chinese characteristics. Several dozen reserve divisions and regiments have been established nationwide, and regular training has been conducted. More than a thousand militia training bases have been established to provide venues for standardized militia training, ensuring the quality of militia training.

    Since 1980, the entire military has participated in supporting national and local key projects totaling more than 2,000 items each year. In times of danger and disaster, the People's Liberation Army is always present. Over the past decade, the entire military has participated in more than 13,000 disaster relief operations, rescuing more than 1.4 million people in danger, and transporting approximately 11 million tons of relief supplies.

    To support national construction, 50% of the military's dedicated railway lines have been opened to the public. The Air Force has vacated 44 airports for civilian aviation operations, with approximately 60,000 civilian aircraft taking off and landing at military airports each year. The Navy has opened 15 ports and airports for paid services to local areas. The entire military has also strongly supported social welfare undertakings.

    The military's cultural and sports achievements are remarkable. Currently, there are thousands of well-established regimental clubs and tens of thousands of company and grassroots clubs. Military athletes have striven hard, winning more than 50 world championships or breaking world records in recent years, contributing to China's efforts to emerge from Asia and go global.
