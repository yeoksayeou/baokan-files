People's Daily, Ottawa, September 6th - Correspondent Guo Wenfu reports: Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu arrived in Ottawa this evening after concluding his visit to Mexico, beginning his three-day official visit to Canada.

Local opinion generally believes that Prime Minister Kaifu and Prime Minister Mulroney will mainly discuss strengthening economic and trade relations between the two countries, as well as environmental protection and the debt of developing countries, during their meeting tomorrow.

Japan is Canada's most important trading partner in Asia. Over the years, trade between the two countries has often resulted in a deficit for Canada. Canada has been actively seeking to increase its market share in Japan while also hoping to obtain technology and investment from Japan.

According to the schedule, Prime Minister Kaifu will depart Ottawa for Vancouver on the 8th for a one-day visit before returning to Japan from there to conclude his visit to Canada.

    日本首相抵加拿大访问
    本报渥太华9月6日电　记者郭文福报道：日本首相海部俊树今天傍晚在结束对墨西哥的访问后飞抵渥太华，开始他对加拿大为期3天的正式访问。
    此间舆论普遍认为，海部俊树首相和马尔罗尼总理在明天的会谈中将主要讨论加强两国经济和贸易关系以及环保、发展中国家债务等问题。
    日本是加拿大在亚洲的最重要的贸易伙伴。多年来双方贸易中经常是加方逆差，当时加方一直积极设法更多地打入日本市场，同时也希望获得来自日本的技术和投资。
    根据日程，海部俊树首相将于8日早上离开渥太华前往温哥华访问一天，然后从那里结束访加回国。
