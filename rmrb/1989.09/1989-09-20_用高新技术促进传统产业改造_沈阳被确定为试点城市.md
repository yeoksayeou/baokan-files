Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 19th.

The State Science and Technology Commission has recently designated Shenyang as the first city in China to pilot the "acceleration of high-tech and new technology industrialization to promote the upgrading of traditional industries," and has approved the specific pilot plan.

The State Science and Technology Commission chose Shenyang for the pilot project primarily to explore new pathways for developing high-tech industries in conjunction with upgrading traditional industries. Simultaneously, it aims to deepen the reform of the science and technology system, implement the "Torch Program," create new experiences, and play a demonstration and guiding role in promoting national science and technology work.

According to Li Houxuan, Director of the Shenyang Municipal Science and Technology Commission, the pilot work will be carried out in four main areas. One of these is to focus on the initial phase of implementing "Torch Projects," leveraging national projects in Shenyang such as the robot demonstration project, large-scale integrated circuits, photonic materials technology development center, non-woven fabric technology development center, and sensor component technology development center. The goal is to develop 50 high-tech products, including light aircraft and neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet materials, within the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," achieving a production value of 2 billion yuan.

To ensure the success of this pilot project, the State Science and Technology Commission and the Shenyang Municipal Government will implement a series of preferential policies in areas such as funding to provide support.

　　用高新技术促进传统产业改造
　　沈阳被确定为试点城市
    据新华社沈阳9月19日电　（记者刘欣欣、张非非）国家科委最近确定，沈阳市为我国第一个进行“加速高技术新技术产业化，促进传统产业改造”的试点城市，并且批准了具体的试点方案。
    国家科委选定在沈阳进行试点，主要目的是探索发展高新技术产业同改造传统产业相结合的新途径。同时，为深化科技体制改革、实施“火炬计划”创造新的经验，为推动全国的科技工作发挥示范引导作用。
    据沈阳市科委主任李厚轩介绍，试点工作将从4个方面展开，其中之一是抓好“火炬项目”实施的起步工程，以国家在沈阳兴建的机器人示范工程、大规模集成电路、感光材料技术开发中心、非织造布技术开发中心、传感元器件技术开发中心为依托，力争在“八五”期间开发出轻型飞机，钕铁硼永磁材料等50个高新技术产品，形成产值20亿元。
    为搞好这项试点，国家科委和沈阳市政府都将在资金等有关方面采取一系列优惠政策予以支持。
