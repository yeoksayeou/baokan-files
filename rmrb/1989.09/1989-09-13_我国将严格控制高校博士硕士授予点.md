Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 12th.

China will strictly control the granting of doctoral and master's degrees by universities in the future. The fourth preliminary review meeting for the national degree-granting authority of master's degree disciplines and specialties was held recently at Hangzhou University. The meeting proposed that the focus of China's doctoral and master's degree authorization work in the future will be on consolidating and improving existing authorization points, adhering to the principle of gradual progress and stable development.

It is reported that nearly one-third of China's undergraduate institutions are currently doctoral degree-granting units, and nearly two-thirds are master's degree-granting units. This proportion has already exceeded that of some developed countries. In the foreseeable future, the number of ordinary universities granting doctoral and master's degrees will be strictly controlled.

In the future, the degree evaluation work will focus on the following aspects: First, the authorization work will prioritize disciplines that are urgently needed for national construction, and will gradually shift towards applied sciences. Second, authorization points will be placed in disciplines with relatively good overall conditions, strong academic teams, and research capabilities. For the social sciences, especially disciplines such as philosophy and politics, strict reviews will be conducted to ensure that the academic direction of the discipline aligns with the Four Cardinal Principles. The ideological level of the supervisors will also be subject to strict review requirements. Additionally, this review will adjust the age structure of doctoral supervisors, with the principle that the age of applicants should generally be below 60.

　　我国将严格控制高校博士硕士授予点
    新华社杭州9月12日电　日前在杭州大学召开的国家教委第四批硕士学位学科、专业授权初审会议提出：今后我国博士、硕士学位授权工作的重点将放在巩固和提高现有的授权点上，坚持小步走，稳步发展。
    据介绍，我国现在已有将近1／3的本科院校是博士授予单位，将近2／3的本科院校是硕士授予单位，这个比例已经超过了一些发达国家。在今后相当一段时间内，普通高校博士、硕士学位授予单位都要严加控制。
    今后的学位评审工作将重点抓好以下几个方面：首先，授权工作优先考虑国家建设急需的学科，以后总体上将转向以应用科学为主；其次，把授权点放在整体条件比较好、具有较好的学术梯队及科研能力的学科上。对社会科学领域，特别是哲学、政治等学科点，要严格审核学科的学术方向是否符合四项基本原则，对导师的马列主义水平也要提出严格的审核要求；另外，这次的评审工作将调整博士生导师的年龄结构，原则上规定申报年龄要在60岁以下。
