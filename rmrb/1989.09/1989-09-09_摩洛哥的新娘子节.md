In the North African kingdom of Morocco, specifically in the province of Laayoune, there is an interesting traditional festival known as the Bride Festival, which takes place from September 12 to 14. This festival is a collective wedding ceremony for the local ethnic groups.

During the festival, a remote mountainous area in the province is filled with various tents and vendors. In the central square, there are three rows of neatly arranged people. The first row consists entirely of brides, their faces adorned with rouge and intricate designs. They are draped in woolen blankets and wear beautiful headscarves with small beads hanging from the forehead, which jingle pleasantly with every movement. Their feet are shod in embroidered shoes adorned with metallic sequins. The second row is made up of young men dressed in white robes, the grooms. The third row consists of the brides' fathers. Each trio walks to a long table where two officials carefully question the brides and complete the marriage registration procedures. They then proceed to a tent set up by the provincial government to receive congratulations from government officials. At 2 PM, guests are invited to dine in a specially set-up tent. At this time, newlywed couples parade around the central square, allowing guests to see them and share in their joy and happiness. Meanwhile, the stage in the square comes alive with music, and a professional dance troupe performs, pushing the festive atmosphere to its peak.

    摩洛哥的新娘子节
    在北非摩洛哥王国的拉西地亚省有个有趣的传统节日——新娘子节，日期是在9月12日至14日。它是当地民族的集体婚礼节日。
    节日里，在远离省城的山区一个中心地点，布满了各式帐篷，商贩云集。广场上，有三排整齐的人群。第一排全是脸上涂着胭脂、画着图案的新娘子。她们身上披着羊毛毯，头上裹着漂亮的围巾，围巾上还有小珠片挂在额前，头一摆动，就发出清脆悦耳的叮当响声；脚上穿着镶有金属亮片的绣花鞋。第二排是穿着白色长袍的男青年，即新郎。最后一排是新娘子的父亲。他们依次每前后三人一行走到一个长桌旁，坐在长桌旁的两位工作人员认真地向新娘问话，办理结婚登记手续；然后再一起走到省政府设立的办事机构的帐篷前，接受政府官员的祝贺。下午2时，来宾应邀到专设的帐篷中就餐。这时一对对新婚夫妇在中央广场绕场一圈，让来宾们一睹他们的风采，分享他们的幸福和喜悦。同时广场戏台上音乐声起，专业舞踏队边歌边舞，把欢乐气氛推向高潮。　（杰）
