Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 12th.

Since the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department issued the Notice, various levels of supervision authorities have actively implemented it and achieved remarkable results. As of September 11th, according to incomplete statistics from 24 provinces and municipalities, 722 individuals have confessed and reported their illegal and disciplinary issues related to embezzlement and bribery to various levels of supervision authorities, involving an amount of 5,567,200 yuan, of which 5,156,600 yuan has been surrendered. A batch of valuable items has also been seized, including cars, motorcycles, gold rings, gold necklaces, watches, etc.

In recent times, the public's enthusiasm for reporting has significantly increased, with a substantial rise in reports of illegal and disciplinary behaviors such as embezzlement and bribery by state administrative personnel. This has provided supervision authorities with more case leads. Many individuals with illegal and disciplinary behaviors have proactively confessed and reported their issues, and they will be treated leniently.
