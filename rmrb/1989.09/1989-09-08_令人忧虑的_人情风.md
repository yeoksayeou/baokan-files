A "human relations wind" is sweeping through many rural areas.

According to a survey by the Hebei Province Rural Social and Economic Investigation Team of 42 counties (cities), 420 villages, and 4,200 households, the amount of cash gifts given by farmers has been increasing year by year. From 1982 to 1988, the average amount of cash gifts given by farmers increased fivefold, with an annual growth rate of 30%. Based on this, it is estimated that last year alone, the province spent 9.6 billion yuan on cash gifts.

According to a survey by the Jiangsu Province Rural Investigation Team of 3,400 households, the average amount spent on gifts to relatives and friends in the first half of the year reached 37 yuan per person, and 160 yuan per household, a 30% increase over the same period last year. Based on this, it is estimated that farmers in the entire province will spend 19.2 billion yuan to pay off "human relations debts." In this way, many households that have just begun to prosper are once again burdened with heavy debts. Meanwhile, the amount spent on purchasing agricultural production materials was only 42.3 yuan per person, and the amount spent on livestock was 33.5 yuan, which is only a 19% and 5% increase over the same period last year, respectively.

The increasingly strong "human relations wind" not only increases the economic burden on farmers and affects agricultural investment but also weakens the construction of spiritual civilization in rural areas, which is detrimental to the economic and cultural development of rural areas.

To curb the "human relations wind," it is necessary to strengthen the ideological and political work in rural areas, mobilize the propaganda machinery, and do a good job of educating farmers. Farmers should be encouraged to educate themselves, using typical cases and examples from their own communities to illustrate the consequences, to help them distinguish right from wrong, and to free themselves from ignorance and backwardness. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate village rules and regulations that are conducive to curbing the "human relations wind" and to establish a new socialist style of civilization and thrift.

The reason why the "human relations wind" is becoming increasingly strong is related to the fact that some party members and cadres in rural areas lead the way in holding extravagant banquets or using their positions to accept bribes. It is urgent and necessary to strengthen the education of village cadres and seriously carry out anti-corruption work to curb the "human relations wind." As long as village cadres take the lead in breaking bad habits and setting new trends, refusing to accept invitations and gifts, the spread of the "human relations wind" will definitely be effectively curbed.

### 令人忧虑的“人情风”

    令人忧虑的“人情风”
    顾长华
    一股“人情风”正在不少农村刮起。
    据河北省农村社会经济调查队对42个县（市）、420个村、4200个农户的抽样调查，农民馈赠现金的数额逐年递增，1982年至1988年的7年间，农民人均赠送现金支出增长5倍，递增速度为30％。据此匡算，去年全省为9.6亿元。
    又据江苏省农村调查队对全省3400农户抽样调查表明，上半年人均用于馈赠亲友的支出达37元，户均160元，比去年同期增长30％。据此推算，全省农民要花费19.2亿元来支付
  “人情债”。这样，不少刚刚走上富裕之路的农户又背上了沉重包袱。而同期用于购买农业生产资料款项人均仅42.3元，畜牧业支出33.5元，仅比去年同期分别增长19％和5％。
    愈刮愈烈的“人情风”，不仅加重了农民的经济负担，影响了农业投入，而且削弱了农村的精神文明建设，对农村经济和文化发展都是不利的。
    为遏制“人情风”，必须切实加强农村的思想政治工作，开动宣传机器，做好对农民的教育工作。要倡导农民自己教育自己，用发生在身边的一些典型事例、典型案例进行现身说法，晓以利害，使其明辨是非，从愚昧和落后的困境中解脱出来。与此同时，还要制订有利于遏制“人情风”的乡规民约，树立文明、节俭的社会主义新风尚。
    “人情风”之所以愈刮愈猛，与农村中一些党员、干部带头大操大办或利用职权吃请受贿不无关系。切实加强对乡村干部的教育，认真搞好廉政建设，对于遏制“人情风”，显得尤为迫切和必要。只要乡村干部带头破陋习、树新风，不吃请、不收礼，就一定会有效地遏制“人情风”蔓延的势头。
