German literary giant Goethe, at the age of seventy-eight, once wrote in his diary: "In the evening, I studied on my own and continued reading 'The Story of the Stone'." Goethe had read Chinese literary works such as 'The Story of the Stone', 'The Story of the Unsuccessful Scholar', and 'The Jade Hairpin'. Once, after dinner, Goethe told his contemporary poet Eckermann: "Chinese novels are not as strange as people imagine. First, human thoughts, actions, and emotions are more clearly, purely, and morally depicted in Chinese novels. Second, the characters and the objective environment are closely integrated, and the descriptions in the novels are like beautiful Chinese paintings. Third, the stories are beautiful and rich in aphoristic meaning." Eckermann, upon hearing this, asked with great interest: "Are the novels you read perhaps the best in Chinese literature?" Goethe replied: "No. China has tens of thousands of novels, and long before our ancestors lived in the forests, they already had excellent works."

    歌德喜爱中国文学
    德国大文豪歌德在七十八岁时，在日记中曾这样写道：“晚上自修，续读《花笺记》。”歌德曾读过《花笺记》、《好逑传》和《玉娇梨》等中国文学作品。有一次饭后聊天，歌德对同时代诗人爱克曼说：“中国小说并不像人们所想象的那么奇怪。一是人的思想、行为和感情在中国小说中，被体现得更明朗些、纯洁些，也更合乎道德标准；二是人物与客观环境结合紧密，小说里描写的活像一幅美丽的中国画；三是故事优美，并富有格言意味”。爱克曼听后很感兴趣地问道：“您读的也许是中国小说中最好的吧？”歌德回答说：“不。中国有成千上万的小说，而且远在我们的祖先还住在森林内之前，他们就已经有优秀的作品了。”
