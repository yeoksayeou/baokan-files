Wulingyuan, which embodies the qualities of "majestic, perilous, strange, wild, and beautiful," attracted 500,000 tourists in the previous year and 1.5 million last year. Friends from afar continue to arrive, all praising Wulingyuan as a hidden gem among the mountain ranges.

Wulingyuan includes scenic spots such as Zhangjiajie, Suoxiyu, and Tianzishan. There are over 3,000 mountains and hills, more than 800 streams, and over 70 waterfalls, including "June Snow" and "Mandarin Duck Falls." The natural wonders, sculpted by the gods, feature 85 first-class formations that resemble humans, immortals, birds, and beasts, all vividly lifelike. There are also primitive secondary forests and rare animals and plants. Nationally rare plants can be found in Suoxiyu, accounting for 80% of the total.

This enchanting and beautiful area originally belonged to the three counties of Dayong, Sangzhi, and Cili under the jurisdiction of Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. In September last year, with the approval of the State Council, the three counties were merged to form the new city of Dayong, with a clear policy of developing tourism as the leading industry, accelerating the pace of development and construction. Currently, the 369-square-kilometer Wulingyuan has developed 1,349 scenic spots and 40 scenic areas. Within the area, over 500 kilometers of tourist roads are interconnected, and supporting service facilities are continually improving. The construction of a national second-class airport, which began in September this year, is expected to be completed within two years. At that time, people will be able to fly directly to Wulingyuan.

    远朋源源来武陵
    集“雄、险、奇、野、秀”于一身的武陵源，前年游客50万，去年150万。远朋源源来，皆赞武陵山脉藏明珠。
    武陵源包括张家界、索溪峪、天子山等风景胜地，有山峦峰岭3000余座，山涧溪水800余条，“六月雪”、“鸳鸯瀑”等瀑布70多处。鬼斧神工，在群峰中雕就的一级造型有85处，若人若仙，似禽似兽，栩栩如生。还有原始次森林和珍贵动植物。全国珍贵的植物，仅在索溪峪就可找到80％。
    这块神奇优美的地方，原属湘西土家族苗族自治州的大庸、桑植和常德地区的慈利三县管辖。去年9月，经国务院批准，将三县组成新的大庸市，明确了以旅游为龙头的建市方针，加快了开发建设速度。目前，总面积为369平方公里的武陵源已开发出1349个风景点、40个风景区，区内500多公里游路，路路相通，配套服务设施日益改善。今年9月开始动工的国家二级机场，两年内将可竣工。到那时，人们就可从空中飞到武陵源了。（沈志坚　周怀玄）
