The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Li De Min reports: "Big Economic Commission, Medium Planning Commission, Small Science and Technology Commission," this sequence is logical in some counties, but the comrades from the Per County Science and Technology Commission told the reporter: "In our county, the Economic Commission, Planning Commission, and Science and Technology Commission are on equal footing." Per County is a developed county in Henan, and the county's Science and Technology Commission has made significant contributions to economic development. They do not sit in "easy offices," instead, they act as good "think tanks," and have accomplished the following:

	* Promoting the scientific and technological awareness of the county committee and county government. There is a saying: "Those with the power to decide do not understand science and technology, while those who understand science and technology have no power to decide." However, in Per County, "those who understand science and technology help those with the power to decide, and those with the power to decide respect the opinions of those who understand science and technology." The Science and Technology Commission, from drafting the county's long-term plans to studying short-term projects, uses every opportunity to inform the county committee and county government leaders, aiding in scientific decision-making by the county committee and county government. They call this "promoting the scientific and technological awareness of leaders." At the same time, the Science and Technology Commission also values promoting the scientific and technological awareness of the masses, exceeding the "Spark" training plan.

	* Actively creating economic benefits. Per County is one of the earliest counties in Henan to hold a science and technology market. The Science and Technology Commission values activating the science and technology market, utilizing the comprehensive functions of the market to provide technological services to factories and rural areas, increasing benefits, and avoiding losses. The second-level institutions under the Science and Technology Commission all operate under enterprise management, encouraging the creation of economic benefits. Based on the economic benefits created for factories and rural areas, rewards and punishments are implemented. The Science and Technology Commission packages the recovery of scientific research projects and funds to individuals, enhancing responsibility, and making projects and funds quickly realize benefits. Now, the Science and Technology Commission and its subordinate institutions are bustling with visitors seeking consultations, verifications, and projects. The Science and Technology Commission has become the "God of Wealth."

	* Broadly conducting external scientific and technological liaison. The Per County Science and Technology Commission has registered, contacted, and visited the Per County science and technology personnel working in Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, and other places, establishing a network of "technological connections" and "liaison networks." These external science and technology personnel provide Per County with strategies, introducing a large number of technologies, projects, and funds. Last year, they proposed over a hundred beneficial suggestions and provided 64 pieces of technological information. The Wuhan liaison group, through their efforts, ensured that the steam turbine ordered by the Per County Second Power Plant in Wuhan was delivered half a year earlier, allowing the power plant to start generating electricity earlier.

	* Relaxing and activating policies for science and technology personnel. Per County established a science and technology personnel coordination group led by the county magistrate, formulating eight policy regulations for relaxing and activating science and technology personnel to go to the countryside and factories. Several hundred science and technology personnel have already been paired with township enterprises and farmers for part-time technical service work. Over 4,000 science and technology personnel have been granted titles by the county, legitimately taking up their posts. The Science and Technology Commission also opens the door for science and technology personnel from other places to work in Per County. Now, over 2,000 science and technology personnel from other places work in Per County each year, and some important projects are completed under their guidance.

The efforts of the Science and Technology Commission have promoted scientific and technological work. Last year, Per County won 1 national-level scientific and technological achievement award, 12 Henan provincial-level awards, 8 Zhengzhou municipal-level awards, and for the first time, won a national "Spark" science and technology award.

### 不坐“清闲衙门”　当好“智囊机关”　巩县科委为发展经济办实事

　　不坐“清闲衙门”　当好“智囊机关”
　　巩县科委为发展经济办实事
    本报讯　记者李德民报道：“大经委、中计委、小科委”，这个排列顺序在有些县是顺理成章的，但是河南巩县科委的同志告诉记者：我们县是经委、计委、科委“肩膀头一样平”。巩县在河南是经济发达县，县科委为发展经济作出重要贡献。他们不坐“清闲衙门”，当好“智囊机关”，办了以下几方面的实事：
    ——开发县委、县政府的科技意识。有个说法是：“有权拍板的不懂科技，懂科技的无权拍板”，巩县却是“懂科技的帮有权的拍板，有权的尊重懂科技的意见”。科委从制订全县的远景规划到研究近期的项目，都利用一切机会给县委、县政府的领导同志通气，以利于县委、县政府的科学决策。他们管这叫作“开发领导的科技意识”。同时，科委也重视开发群众的科技意识，超额完成“星火”培训计划。
    ——积极创造经济效益。巩县是河南省最早举办科技市场的一个县，科委重视搞活科技市场，发挥科技市场的综合功能，为工厂、农村进行科技服务，增加效益，避免损失。科委的下属二级机构全部实行企业管理，鼓励积极创造经济效益，根据为工厂、农村创造经济效益的情况，进行奖惩。科委对科研项目和经费的回收包干到人，增强了责任心，使项目和资金尽快实现效益。现在科委及其下属机构门庭若市，来咨询、论证、要项目的人应接不暇。科委成了“财神爷”。
    ——广泛开展对外科技联络。巩县科委对在北京、郑州、武汉、西安等地工作的巩县科技人员，逐一登记，发函联系，登门拜访，建立起科技“关系户”、“联络网”。这些外地科技人员为巩县出谋献策，引进大量技术、项目、资金，去年他们提出有益建议百余条，提供科技信息64项。武汉联络组的同志经过努力，使巩县第二电厂在汉订购的汽轮机交货合同提前半年，可使电厂提前发电。
    ——放宽放活科技人员政策。巩县成立了以县长为组长的科技人员协调小组，制定了放宽放活科技人员下乡下厂的8条政策规定，已有几百名科技人员同乡镇企业、农户挂钩，从事兼职技术服务工作。有4000多名科技人员被县里授予职称，名正言顺地上岗到位。科委还为外地科技人员来巩县工作打开方便之门，现在每年有2000多名外地科技人员在巩县工作，一些重要项目是在他们指导下完成的。
    科委的努力促进了科技工作。去年巩县获国家级科技成果奖1项，河南省级12项，郑州市级8项，还首次获得一项国家星火科技奖。
