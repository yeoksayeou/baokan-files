The People's Daily, Beijing, September 15th—Reporter Song Shiqin learned from the organizational work achievements symposium held by the Central Organization Department today that over the past 40 years, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the state, a large-scale cadre team, comprising various specialized talents, has gradually taken shape. This team has undergone multi-faceted tempering and testing and is basically suited to the needs of socialist construction.

According to relevant departments of the Central Organization Department, compared to the early days of the founding of the nation, this cadre team has undergone three major changes and has one prominent feature.

The scale of the cadre team has grown from small to large. In the early days of the founding of the nation, our cadre team had only 1.7 million people, of whom 400,000 were retained from the old regime. Over the past 40 years, the People's Republic has adopted various methods and means to cultivate and train a large number of cadres, reaching 30 million today, an increase of more than three times compared to 6.63 million in 1954. More than 95% of the entire cadre team joined the workforce after the founding of the nation.

The professional categories of the cadre team have expanded from few to many. In 1954, there were only 570,000 professional and technical cadres, accounting for 8% of the total cadre team. By 1988, the number of various professional and technical personnel had reached nearly 21 million, accounting for 67% of the total cadre team. Currently, there are a considerable number of specialized talents in each of the 21 major professional categories.

The cultural and professional qualifications of the cadre team have improved from low to high. Since the founding of the nation, our country has not only focused on cultivating talents through ordinary higher and secondary education but has also paid great attention to strengthening the training of in-service cadres. By 1988, cadres with a high school or vocational school education and above had reached 23.04 million, accounting for 75%, of whom 8.61 million had a college education and above, accounting for 28%.

A prominent feature of the cadre team of New China is that this cadre team of the People's Republic is a fighting force composed of several generations of revolutionaries. It includes veteran proletarian revolutionaries who have undergone numerous tests; a mature and experienced middle-aged generation that is still in their prime; and a large number of young people who are growing and developing. They are the mainstay of the frontlines. This cadre team is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the motherland, becoming a reliable backbone force for socialist modernization construction and reform.

    队伍规模扩大　专业门类齐全　文化素质提高
　　我国干部人数达三千万
　　老中青融为一体成为四化建设中坚力量
    本报北京9月15日讯　记者宋世琦从中央组织部今天召开的建国40周年组织工作成就座谈会上获悉，40年来，在党和国家的培养教育下，一支规模宏大、各类专门人才荟萃、经过多方面锻炼和考验、基本适应社会主义建设需要的干部队伍已逐步形成。
    据中组部有关部门介绍，与建国初期相比，这支干部队伍有三大变化、一个显著特点。
    干部队伍的规模由小到大。建国初期，我们的干部队伍只有170万人，其中40万人是从旧政权中接收留用的。40年来，人民共和国采取各种途径和方式，培养、训练了大批干部，到现在已达3000万人，比1954年的663万，增长了3倍多。整个干部队伍中，95％以上是建国以后参加工作的。
    干部队伍的专业门类由少到全。1954年，专业技术干部只有57万人，占干部队伍总数的8％。到1988年，各类专业技术人员已达近2100万人，占干部队伍总数的67％。现在，21个大的专业门类的各类专门人才，都有相当数量。
    干部队伍的文化专业素质由低到高。建国以来，我们的国家除了注重通过普通高、中等教育培养人才以外，还十分注意加强在职干部的培训。到1988年，高中、中专以上文化程度的干部已达2304万人，占75％，其中，大专以上文化程度的干部861万人，占28％。
    新中国这支干部队伍的显著特点是：人民共和国这支干部队伍是由几代革命者融为一体的战斗队，她既有久经考验的老一代无产阶级革命家；又有已经成长起来的、经验丰富而又年富力强的中年一代；还有一大批正在成长着的年轻一代，他们是各条战线的生力军。这支干部队伍忠于党，忠于人民，忠于祖国，成为社会主义现代化建设和改革的可靠的中坚力量。
