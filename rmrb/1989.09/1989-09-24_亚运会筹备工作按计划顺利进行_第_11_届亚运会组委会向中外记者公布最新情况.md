    Preparation for the Asian Games Proceeds Smoothly According to Plan
    The Organizing Committee of the 11th Asian Games Briefs Domestic and Foreign Journalists on the Latest Situation

    BEIJING, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- The vice-chairmen of the Organizing Committee of the 11th Asian Games, Zhang Baifa and He Zhenliang, held a press conference at the Beijing Hotel this morning to introduce the progress of the preparations for the Games and to announce the latest figures regarding the preparations.

    Zhang Baifa said that since the decision was made at the Third General Assembly of the Asian Olympic Council in September 1984 to hold the 11th Asian Games in Beijing, the Chinese government and people, as well as overseas friends, have shown great concern and support. The Beijing Municipal Government, the State Sports Commission, and various relevant departments have spared no effort in making extensive preparations. He said, "Today, we can proudly announce to everyone: the 11th Asian Games will not only be held on schedule, but all preparatory work is proceeding smoothly according to plan. We are determined to make this Games a success."

    The vice-mayor of Beijing, known for his frankness and directness, announced the latest situation regarding the Asian Games. The entire Asian Games project (including the renovation of sports venues) covers nearly one million square meters, with a total investment of 2.1 billion yuan, excluding various preferential policies granted by the state, such as tax exemptions and land acquisition (approximately 900 million yuan). The investment and scale of the project are basically in line with China's economic strength.

    Due to the addition of performance event venues, the number of newly built and renovated sports venues has increased to 33, including 19 new venues, 5 renovated venues, and 9 existing venues. Of these 33 venues, all except the Qinhuangdao Water Sports Center are in Beijing. The Organizing Committee will also provide 46 training venues with a total of 132 fields for various teams to use. All venues, except for five that will be completed by May next year, will be handed over for use by the end of this year.

    According to preliminary estimates by the Organizing Committee, athletes from various Asian countries and regions will number between 6,000 and 7,000. Approximately 2,500 representatives from the Asian Olympic Council, the International Olympic Committee, and various member organizations will attend, along with about 4,000 domestic and foreign journalists. It is also expected that a significant number of foreign tourists will come to visit. Zhang Baifa revealed that one country has already reserved 900 tickets for the opening ceremony.

    Regarding the safety and traffic issues that have been widely concerned domestically and internationally, Zhang Baifa said that the Organizing Committee has given "sufficient attention" to these matters. During the Asian Games, traffic control will be implemented to ensure the smooth passage of all Asian Games vehicles. In terms of security, modern security measures will be adopted in accordance with international practices, and inspections will be strengthened to ensure that the security work for the Asian Games is foolproof. He said, "In recent times, several Asian Championships have been held in Beijing, and the security work has been satisfactory to friends from various countries. During the Asian Games, we will do an even better job." According to the tradition of the Asian Games, the Organizing Committee should provide equipment and facilities for some competition events. The Organizing Committee of the 11th Asian Games will provide 19 types of equipment totaling over 15,000 items (sets). Among them, 114 types of equipment produced in China have been recognized and approved by international single-sport organizations, accounting for 70%, such as the Jin Cup football from Tianjin and the Red Double Happiness table tennis from Shanghai.

    During the conference, He Zhenliang and Zhang Baifa also answered questions from journalists regarding engineering quality, fundraising, and lottery ticket sales.

    亚运会筹备工作按计划顺利进行
    第11届亚运会组委会向中外记者公布最新情况
    本报北京9月23日讯　记者吴骅报道：今天上午，第十一届亚运会组委会副主席张百发、何振梁在北京饭店举行了记者招待会，向中外记者介绍了亚运会准备工作的进展情况，并且公布了有关亚运会筹备情况的最新数字。
    张百发说，自从1984年9月亚奥理事会第三次代表大会上决定在北京举办第十一届亚运会后，得到了中国政府和人民及海外各界朋友们的关心和支持。北京市、国家体委和各有关部门全力以赴，进行了大量的充分的筹备工作。他说：“今天，我们可以自豪地向大家宣布：第十一届亚运会不仅能够如期举行，而且各项筹备工作正在按计划地顺利进行，我们一定会把本届亚运会办得圆满，办得成功。”
    这位北京市常务副市长，以他惯有的坦诚和直率，公布了有关亚运会的最新情况。整个亚运会工程（包括改建体育场馆）近百万平米，投资共21亿，不包括国家给予的各项优惠政策，如免税、征地等费用（约9个亿）。投资与工程规模基本符合我国的经济实力。
    由于增加了表演项目的比赛场地，目前新建和改建的体育场馆增至33个，其中新建场馆19个，改建5个，利用旧的场馆9个。这33个场地除秦皇岛水上运动场外，其余均在北京。组委会还将提供46个训练场馆共132个场地供各运动队使用。所有场馆除有5个在明年5月竣工，其余全部在今年底交付使用。
    据组委会初步测算，亚洲各国和地区的运动员将达6000至7000人。亚奥理事会、国际奥委会和各成员组织代表约2500人，前来采访的中外新闻记者约4000人。预计前来观光旅游的外国游客数目也十分可观。张百发透露，某国家已来电预定900人的开幕式入场券。
    对于国内外普遍关心的安全和交通问题，张百发表示，组委会已经给予“非常足够的重视”。亚运会期间将实行交通管制，保证亚运会各种车辆的畅通无阻。安全方面将依照国际惯例，采用现代化的保安措施，加强检查，保证亚运会安全工作万无一失。他说：“最近一个时期，在北京举行了几个项目的亚洲锦标赛，安全保卫工作令各国朋友满意。亚运会召开时，我们会做得更细更好。”按照亚运会惯例，组委会应向部分比赛项目提供器材设备。第十一届亚运会组委会将提供19个项目的163种器材共15000多件（套）。其中已被国际单项组织承认和批准的我国生产的器材设备共114种，占70％，如天津金杯牌足球、上海红双喜乒乓球等。
    会上，何振梁、张百发还分别就工程质量、集资、奖券发行等问题回答记者们提问。
