	Moonlit Night Southern Tune
	Chen Ruirui

	The stars shift, the years pass, and many past events fade like dreams and smoke, disappearing with the changing seasons. For some reason, the southern tunes of my hometown under the moonlight remain etched in my memory, lingering in my heart and mind.

	Through the moonlight as pure as fresh snow, faintly coming from the ancient town of my hometown, there is a melodious sound of the flute and a clear, stirring sound of the pipa. The musical notes, like silk threads, linger and echo over the river waves. In the pleasant flute melody, one can hear a sweet-voiced girl gently tapping the wooden clapper, singing a beautiful and elegant southern tune. The tune is filled with poetic and picturesque landscapes of Minnan, as well as the deep affection for one's homeland, and the unwavering pursuit of ideals, light, and happiness by the overseas Chinese. Ah, this is not just a hometown melody; no, this is clearly a heartfelt praise that combines life, labor, love, and art! I think that only those who love life and are full of hope for the future can pour out such wonderful hometown melodies from their hearts!

	The full moon hanging in the sky seems to be drawn with a compass. The ripples on the ten-mile river dance and sparkle with countless silver lights. The moonlight fills every sailboat on the night-anchored river, and it also fills my heart, making me intoxicated.

	The southern tunes echo through the sky and river, dispelling worldly worries and making one feel as if in a dream. Ah, the tune "Departing from Han Pass" sings of the sorrow and grief of Wang Zhaojun leaving her homeland long ago, "The desert wind and border rain, the cold sound of the Hu flute." The tune "Sending Brother and Sister-in-Law" sings of young men and women breaking free from feudal shackles, with a love that is steadfast until death. The tune "Far Gazing at the Hometown" expresses the endless longing of a wanderer for family and hometown. The tune "Lantern Festival on the Fifteenth" expresses the joy of compatriots gathering in the ancient city of the overseas Chinese, "Sharing one full moon, singing the hometown melodies of a hundred generations" ... The delicate strings and lingering hometown melodies are like the first spring breeze from Jiangnan, carrying the fragrance of flowers and grass, elegant, beautiful, and moving, making one unconsciously intoxicated, truly "The sound soars to the heavens, and the clouds stop; the echo enters the deep spring, and the fish do not swim"!

	The southern tunes have been passed down in Minnan for perhaps a thousand years. Even in modern life, the melodies they emit carry distinct marks of different eras. "Music is a river," and every note is a wave of life, reflecting the joys and sorrows, prosperity and decline of the world.

	I remember when I was a child, the night air in my hometown was as heavy as a rock, desolate and barren. Every time the sun set and the cold moon hung in the sky, there would often be a sound of southern tunes from the small alleys, full of sorrow and grief. My mother, sewing under the kerosene lamp, couldn't help but sigh and cry, and my heart was also shrouded in a layer of darkness. At that time, the southern tune artists were of low status, had no dependents, were discriminated against, and lived a miserable life of "singing year after year, difficult year after year, homeless everywhere, home everywhere." The southern tune art was also on the verge of extinction, with broken strings and dying flutes, almost silent.

	It was not until after the founding of the nation that, with a hundred flowers blooming and old things being replaced by new, the southern tunes regained their vitality and prosperity. Memories indeed make one feel a mix of emotions, with countless thoughts. The fate of the southern tunes is like that of a person, sharing the same ups and downs, the same glory and disgrace. But art loved by the people will never be destroyed by whips and sticks. In recent years, when the spring breeze of reform and opening up blows through the ancient city of the overseas Chinese, the economic and cultural construction of the Minnan Golden Triangle is thriving, and the southern tune hometown melodies rise again in the streets and alleys, markets and villages. This pearl of Chinese classical music, southern tunes, shines brightly in the moonlight and lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival and Lantern Festival in the hometown. Currently, there are hundreds of southern tune associations overseas, and even on the streets of Chinatown in the United States, one can see the descendants of the dragon "playing strings and bamboo to express their feelings, hearing the hometown melodies and missing the homeland." Since 1981, several grand "Concerts of Southern Tune Friends from Home and Abroad" have been held in the ancient city of Quanzhou, with the whole city in a festive mood and singing all night long, like a grand folk music art festival. Friends from Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan performed on stage with their hometown compatriots, vibrating the same notes, truly "A hometown melody spreads across the sea, who can resist the longing for the old hometown?!" Under the moonlight and lanterns of the East and West Pagodas and the Luoyang River, the lingering southern tune hometown melodies will surely weave a ribbon of deep affection, tying together the hearts of compatriots at home and abroad, who yearn for the ancient city of the overseas Chinese to leap like a carp and soar like a dragon...

	Ah, the southern tunes of my hometown under the moonlight, I truly want to become a note, merging into your charming melody, deeply praising the enchanting appearance of the beautiful overseas Chinese homeland!

　　月夜南曲
　　陈瑞绕
    星移物换，岁月流年，许多往事如梦如烟，随着时序消逝而淡忘了。不知何故，故乡的月夜南曲，却使我难以忘怀，魂萦情牵。
    透过如初雪一般皎洁的月华，隐约从家乡古镇传来了一阵悠扬动听的洞箫声和清亮激越的琵琶声，如丝如缕的乐音在江波上萦回不绝。悦耳的箫笛声中，听得出是一位嗓喉甜柔的姑娘，轻按寮拍，唱起了优美典雅的南曲；曲中有诗情画意的闽南风光，也有浓郁如酒的故土乡情，更有侨乡儿女对理想、光明和幸福的执著追求。呵，这何止只是一曲乡音，不，这分明是综合着生活、劳动、爱情和艺术的深情的礼赞！我想，只有热爱生活、对未来充满希望的人，才能从心灵中倾吐出如此美妙的乡音！
    悬挂在天心的明月，似乎是用圆规画出来的。十里江流细浪千叠，浮动着、跳跃着万点银辉。月光装满了夜泊江上的每一条帆船，也注入了我如痴如醉的心扉。
    南曲声声，飘绕江天，令人尘虑顿消，恍如置身梦境。呵，一曲《出汉关》，唱出当年王昭君远离故国出雁门、
  “漠风塞雨胡笳凉”的断肠哀怨；一曲《因送哥嫂》，唱出挣脱封建樊笼的青年男女生死不渝的坚贞爱情。一曲《远望乡里》，倾诉不尽天涯游子思亲怀乡的惆怅；而一曲《元宵十五》，则抒发了海内外同胞欢聚侨乡古城，“共一轮明月，唱百代乡音”的喜悦心情……款款丝竹，袅袅乡音，有如江南早春飘来的第一阵夹带着花草芳馨的春风，幽雅、美妙而动人，使人不觉忘情地陶醉于其中，真个是“声飞霄汉云皆驻，响入深泉鱼不游”呵！
    南曲，流传于闽南一带也许已有千年的悠久历史。便是在现代生活中，它所飘逸出来的旋律，也带着各个不同时期的鲜明印记。“音乐是一条河流”，它的每一个音符都是一朵生活的浪花，都反映着人世间的悲欢离合、荣枯兴衰。
    记得我童年时，家乡夜气如磐，一片荒凉凋敝。每当落日黄昏、冷月残夜，时常从小街穷巷传来阵阵如泣如诉的南曲，满含忧怨愁苦之声，在煤油灯下缝衣的母亲听了，忍不住叹息落泪，我的心里也蒙上了一层阴影。那时的南曲艺人地位寒微，生活无依，备受歧视，过着“年年难唱年年唱，处处无家处处家”的凄凉岁月。南音艺术也奄奄一息，弦断箫咽，几近绝响。
    直到建国以后，百花齐放，推陈出新，南曲才又获得复苏、繁荣的生机。回忆确实叫人百感交集，思绪万端。南曲的命运和人的命运一样，共沉浮，同荣辱。但是，人民所喜爱的艺术，终究不是鞭风棍雨摧毁得了的。这些年来，当改革、开放的春风吹拂古城侨乡，闽南金三角经济文化建设事业蓬勃兴旺，市井村镇、长街深巷再度升腾起南曲乡音优美迷人的旋律，南音这一颗中国古典音乐的明珠，又在故乡中秋、元宵的花灯月影里闪耀着璀璨夺目的光采。目前海外南音社团数以百计，即使在美国唐人街，亦可见到龙的传人
  “弄丝竹以寄情，闻乡音而怀土”的动人景象。自1981年以来，在古城泉州隆重举行了数次规模盛大的“海内外南音弦友大会唱”，那种举城欢腾、彻夜笙歌的情景，恰似蔚为大观的民间音乐艺术节。来自东南亚、香港、台湾的弦友与故乡同胞同台演奏，共振宫商，确是“一曲乡音传海宇，何人不起故园情？！”明月花灯辉映的东西塔下、洛阳江畔，飘绕不绝的南曲乡音定然会编织成深情的彩带，把海内外同胞那一颗颗渴望侨乡古城鲤跃龙腾的心，萦系在一起……
    呵，故乡的月夜南曲，我真想化为一个音符，溶汇入你富于魅力的旋律里，深情赞美锦绣侨乡的迷人风姿！
