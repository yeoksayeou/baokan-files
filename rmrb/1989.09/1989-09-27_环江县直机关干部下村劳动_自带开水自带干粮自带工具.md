The county officials of Huanjiang go to the villages to work, bringing their own water, food, and tools.

In July of this year, the Huanjiang County Committee decided that during the summer harvest and planting season, all departments of the county government, except for those on duty and the elderly, sick, and disabled, would each send officials to work in the villages and hamlets for more than three days. They would assist military families, disabled veterans, and large grain sellers in harvesting rice and planting late-season rice. County Committee Secretary Tang Zhongqiu led the way to Qingtan Village in Siyuan Town to harvest wheat and plant late-season rice.

The county committee emphasized in its decision that participating officials should bring their own water, food, and tools, and not add to the burden of the people. Although some villagers had prepared alcohol and food, the officials all declined. In Siyuan Town's Sibei Hamlet, a large grain seller named Tan Mamak had prepared duck, fish, pork, beef, and rice wine to welcome the officials from the county grain bureau who came to work, but they declined.

In the past, officials going to the countryside to work usually chose nearby villages and hamlets. This year, the officials proposed, "As long as the people need us, we will go, no matter how far or how difficult it is." Huanjiang County's Zhongshan Village's Kenmiao Piece is a major grain-producing area, 20 kilometers from the county seat. Due to the large population and few laborers, the double-cropping season is always rushed. This year, various units actively requested to go to Kenmiao Piece to support them. Qian Peitian of Cailing Hamlet, who has sold more than 10,000 kilograms of grain to the state for three consecutive years, has two laborers in his family and contracts 26 mu of responsibility fields. In previous years, they would not finish harvesting early-season rice until the end of August. This year, with the help of 14 officials, they completed the harvesting in just three days and planted 20 mu of late-season rice. To express gratitude for the government's care, Qian Peitian said he would sell 15,000 kilograms of early-season rice to the state this year.

### 环江县直机关干部下村劳动  自带开水自带干粮自带工具

    环江县直机关干部下村劳动
    自带开水自带干粮自带工具
    今年7月，环江县委决定，今年夏收夏种，县直机关各部门除留守人员和老弱病残者外，每名干部都要下村下屯劳动3天以上，帮助军烈属、残废退伍军人、卖粮大户收割稻谷和抢插晚稻。县委书记唐钟球，带头赴思恩镇清潭村收割谷子和抢插晚稻。
    县委在决定中特别强调，参加劳动的干部，要自带开水、自带干粮、自带工具，不增加群众负担。尽管有些群众准备了酒菜，但都被干部们谢绝了。思恩镇寺背屯种粮大户谭妈况，备好鸭、鱼和猪、牛肉及米酒慰问县粮食局来劳动的干部，结果被回绝了。
    过去，干部下乡劳动，大都选择附近村屯。今年，干部们提出：“只要群众需要，再远再艰苦我们也要去。”环江县中山村肯庙片是主要产粮区，距县城20公里，由于这里地多人少，每年双抢往往忙不过来。今年各单位都主动要求到肯庙片去支援。连续3年向国家卖粮超万斤的肯庙片才领屯覃佩天，全家2个劳动力，承包责任田26亩，往年都要到8月底才收割完早稻。今年，在14名干部帮助下，仅3天，就完成了收割任务，还插了20亩晚稻。为了感激政府的关怀，覃佩天表示今年的早稻要卖给国家1.5万斤。
