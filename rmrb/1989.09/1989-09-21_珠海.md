    Zhuhai
    Zhou Yongji

    Concrete piers have become the desire for prosperity,
    Competition reaches for the sky.
    The roads are very wide,
    Still expanding day and night.
    This place is no longer a fishing village,
    But it inherits the ancestral tranquility.
    The municipal building is an open white book,
    Even the illiterate can understand.
    A new concept of the city,
    A fisherwoman stands by the sea,
    Borrowing the distant wind,
    Changing the traditional hairstyle.
    Another "princess" from a fishing background
    Wins the favor of blue-eyed foreigners
    With her fresh Eastern virtues.
    Foreign brands occupying prime spaces,
    Hong Kong and Taiwan pop stars sweeping the golden hours,
    No matter how many temptations are sent out,
    They cannot shake
    The Chinese city guarded by stone lions.

    珠海
    周永基
    水泥站成繁华的欲望
    竞争向天空生长
    很宽阔的道路
    依然在日夜扩张
    这里早已不是渔村
    却继承着祖传的宁静
    市府大厦是一部摊开的白皮书
    文盲也能读懂
    一个关于城市的崭新构思
    渔女伫立海边
    求借远道而来的风
    修改传统的发型
    另一个打渔出身的“皇妹”
    却以清新的东方品德
    赢得蓝眼珠的青睐
    割据显要空间的舶来商标
    风靡黄金时间的港台歌星
    发射再多的诱惑
    也没能撼动
    石狮子守卫的中国城
