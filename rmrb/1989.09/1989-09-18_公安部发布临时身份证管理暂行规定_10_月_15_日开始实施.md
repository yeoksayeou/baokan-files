The Ministry of Public Security has issued the "Provisional Regulations on Temporary ID Cards," which will come into effect on October 15. The regulations, consisting of 27 articles, were approved by the State Council.

The regulations state that Chinese citizens aged 16 and above who reside in the People's Republic of China and have not yet received their resident ID cards, or whose ID cards have been lost or damaged and have not yet been replaced, can apply for a temporary ID card as needed. Chinese citizens aged 16 and above with pending permanent residence status must also apply for a temporary ID card.

Temporary ID cards are legally valid and are issued for periods of one or two years.

Citizens holding temporary ID cards can use them in the same way as resident ID cards when handling matters related to political, economic, and social life.
