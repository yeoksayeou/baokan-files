At 2 a.m. on July 4, Captain Huang Yumin of the Engineering and Bridge Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinhua, Zhejiang, received a phone call from his superiors: "Hello! Is this the Engineering and Bridge Company? 1,600 people in Chixi Township, Lanxi City, are trapped by the floodwaters, and the situation is extremely urgent! Please rush to the disaster area for rescue immediately!"

Upon receiving the order, 18 soldiers quickly made their way to the severely affected villages of Hougong, Qianyi, and Xiaoyi. The area resembled an "island" in the vast sea, with a radius of 5 kilometers covered in water reaching depths of over 3 meters. Some dilapidated houses had collapsed, and the affected residents either climbed trees or crowded onto the roofs of a few newly built buildings. The soldiers, using four inflatable boats, braved the storm and rain, working tirelessly for 17 hours, making 68 trips back and forth, and finally rescued the last batch of disaster-stricken people to safety.

　　一千六百名群众被救
    7月4日凌晨两点，解放军驻浙江金华某部道桥连指导员黄裕民接到了上级的电话：“喂！道桥连吗？兰溪市赤溪乡1600名群众被洪水围困，情况万分危急！请火速赶赴灾区抢救！”
    18名战士接令后迅速到达灾情严重的后龚村、前益村和峡益村。这里好似茫茫大海中的“孤岛”，方圆5公里内一片汪洋，水深达3米多；一些年久失修的瓦房已经坍塌，受灾的群众有的爬上大树，有的挤在几幢新建的楼房顶上。战士们划着4条橡皮舟，顶着狂风暴雨，连续奋战17个小时，来回68趟，终于把最后一批灾民送到安全地带。
