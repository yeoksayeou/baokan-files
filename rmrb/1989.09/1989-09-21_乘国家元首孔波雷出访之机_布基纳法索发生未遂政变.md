Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th.

A coup attempt aimed at overthrowing Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaoré was thwarted on the night of the 18th. The plotters have already been executed. They were Defense and Security Minister Jean-Baptiste Lingani and Economic Development Minister Henri Zongo, who had previously served as the first and second vice-chairmen of the Burkinabé People's Front (the ruling party), respectively, and were Compaoré's deputies.

On the 19th, People's Front Coordination Minister Wédraogo held a press conference stating that the plotters planned to arrest Compaoré upon his return from his visit as he stepped off the plane and to dissolve the People's Front. Fortunately, the vigilance of the Defense and Security Committee Chairman of the People's Front Coordination Executive Committee, Diondéré, foiled the coup plot.

Compaoré returned to the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou on the night of the 19th after completing his visits to China, Japan, Democratic Yemen, and Brunei.

    乘国家元首孔波雷出访之机
    布基纳法索发生未遂政变
    新华社北京9月20日电  （综合本社驻洛美、达喀尔、阿比让记者报道）瓦加杜古消息：一起旨在推翻布基纳法索国家元首孔波雷的政变阴谋18日晚被粉碎。
    政变者昨天已被处决。他们是国防和安全部长让—巴普蒂斯特·林加尼和经济发展部长亨利·宗戈，他们还曾分别担任布基纳法索人民阵线（执政党）第1和第2副主席，是孔波雷的副手。
    人民阵线协调部长韦德拉奥果19日举行记者招待会说，政变者打算在孔波雷访问归来走下飞机时逮捕他，并解散人民阵线，多亏人民阵线协调执委会国防和安全委员会主席迪昂德雷的警惕，政变阴谋未能得逞。
    孔波雷在结束对中国、日本、民主也门和文莱的访问后已于19日晚返回布基纳法索首都瓦加杜古。
