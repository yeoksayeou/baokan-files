The yen sharply appreciated against the dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market on the 25th, reaching a level of 142.20 yen to the dollar at one point, the same level as a month ago. The closing price was 142.95 yen to the dollar, up 2.05 yen from the previous weekend.

The yen's appreciation was influenced by the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven major Western countries held in Washington.

    日元对美元汇价急剧上升
    在二十五日的东京外汇市场上，日元汇价急剧上升，一时达一个月前的一美元兑换一百四十二点二○日元的水平。收盘价格为一美元兑换一百四十二点九五日元，比上周末高二点○五日元。
    日元再次升值是受在华盛顿召开的西方七国财长和中央银行行长会议影响的结果。
