A book titled "From Politics: A Mirror of History," which uses history as a mirror to educate a wide range of cadres on building a clean government, will be published and distributed on National Day.

This work was compiled based on a suggestion by Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Li Ruihuan wrote a preface and inscribed the words: "Learn from the past to know the future, use the past to serve the present."

The book contains 700,000 words and covers historical figures from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties up to the May Fourth Movement, involving more than 460 well-known political figures. The book is almost an encyclopedia of famous figures in the political arena throughout history. The book is divided into six parts: the way of politics, principles of politics, strategies of politics, cultivation of politics, taboos of politics, and women in politics.
