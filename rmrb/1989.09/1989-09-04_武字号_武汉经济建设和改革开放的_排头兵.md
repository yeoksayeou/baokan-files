The enterprises affectionately known as the "Wuhan Enterprises" by the people of Wuhan have long been at the forefront of Wuhan's economic development and recent reforms and opening up.

Enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Wuhan Boiler Plant, Wuchang Shipyard, and Wuhan Meat Processing Plant are among the 156 key national construction projects of the First Five-Year Plan. The "Wuhan Enterprises" laid the foundation for Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, to become a major industrial city in the country, and are also the "flagship" enterprises that have strengthened Hubei's industrial power.

Data and statistics from the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation show that the "Wuhan Enterprises," which once led the parade celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation, still hold the same position 30 years later: Wuhan Iron and Steel produces 8.5% and 10% of the nation's total steel and steel products respectively each year; the 4-meter CNC double-column lathes from Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant have earned Wuhan the first national quality award in the heavy machine tool industry; the "Wuhan Enterprises" contribute approximately one-third of Wuhan's total tax revenue to the state each year.

After years of hard work and external introductions, the strength of the "Wuhan Enterprises" has significantly improved: Wuhan Iron and Steel, which produced 150 million tons of steel and iron annually in the 1960s, had developed to "double 400 million tons" by the early 1980s and is now planning to upgrade to "double 700 million tons"; with the construction of the 1.7-meter rolling mill project, Wuhan Iron and Steel has become a large-scale integrated steel enterprise capable of producing hot-rolled and cold-rolled thin plates, strips, silicon steel sheets, medium and thick steel plates, and some profiles; the products of Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, known as the "Pearl of Asia," have expanded from the initial 17 varieties to over 130 varieties, making it the largest backbone enterprise in the national machine tool industry that integrates scientific research and production.

In recent years, the "Wuhan Enterprises" have consistently aimed for world-class standards. Wuhan Iron and Steel has developed and appraised 57 new varieties, with 33 reaching international quality standards for similar products. The shipbuilding steel materials rolled by Wuhan Iron and Steel passed the joint inspection by the ship classification societies of England, the United States, Norway, and China in August this year, surprising foreign surveyors. Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has set its sights on the product standards of heavy machine tools produced by companies such as Siemens in West Germany and Westinghouse in the United States, and its products enjoy a high reputation in the European and American markets. Wuhan people, who have won multiple national quality awards, have always believed that the national quality gold medal won by Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is a "genuine gold medal" because it has a "'gold content' that is different"!

In production and operations, the "Wuhan Enterprises" have consistently prioritized national interests. Wuhan Iron and Steel has maintained a 100% contract fulfillment rate since implementing national contracts. Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Wuhan Boiler Plant, and Wuchang Shipyard have overcome various unfavorable factors, ensuring the urgent needs of national key construction projects even if it means not making a profit. With these "Wuhan Enterprises" as the backbone, along with a large number of "Wuhan Enterprises" in various categories developed by Wuhan City itself, their contributions are becoming increasingly significant as the economy develops and reforms deepen.

Wuhan, a major central city in the heart of the motherland, plays a crucial role in Hubei's rise in the central region.

### “武字号”——武汉经济建设和改革开放的“排头兵”

    “武字号”——武汉经济建设和改革开放的“排头兵”
    被武汉人亲昵称作“武字号”的几家大型国营企业，一直是武汉经济建设和近年改革开放的“排头兵”。
    武汉钢铁公司、武汉重型机床厂、武汉锅炉厂、武昌造船厂、武汉肉类联合加工厂这些“武字号”，与武汉长江大桥等同属“一五”期间国家156个重点建设项目之列。“武字号”奠定了湖北省会武汉市成为国家新兴工业重镇的基础，也都是增强湖北工业实力的“拳头”企业。
    建国40周年前夕的资料和数据表明，曾走在庆祝建国10周年武汉游行队伍最前列的“武字号”，30年后的地位仍同当年：武钢使武汉每年为国家提供的钢、钢材分别占全国总产量的8.5％和10％；武重的4米数控双柱立车使武汉夺得全国重型机床行业的第一枚国家质量奖金牌；“武字号”每年上交国家的利税约占武汉市利税总额的1／3。
    经过多年的艰苦奋斗和对外引进，“武字号”的自身实力眼下却“今非昔比”：60年代年产钢、铁各150万吨的武钢到80年代初已发展到“双四百”万吨，目前又在筹资进行“双七百”万吨的改造；同时由于一米七轧机工程的兴建，武钢已成为能生产热轧及冷轧薄板、带钢、硅钢片、中厚钢板及部分型材的大型联合钢铁企业；被誉为“亚洲明珠”的武重的产品已由建厂初期的17个品种发展到了130多个品种，成为科研、生产一体的全国机床行业最大的骨干企业。
    近年，“武字号”始终坚持把眼睛瞄准世界水平。武钢一米七新开发并鉴定的57个品种，已有33种达到国际同类产品质量；对武钢轧制的船用钢材今年8月能一次通过英、美、挪、中4国船级社的联审，令国外的验船师们大为惊讶。武重盯住联邦德国席士公司、美国西宝公司产品标准生产的重型机床，质量在欧美市场享有盛誉。已获得多枚国家质量奖牌的武汉人，一直认为武重夺得的那枚国家质量金牌是“够真水平的金牌”，因为它“‘含金量’不同”！
    在生产经营中，“武字号”坚持把国家利益放在首位。武钢自执行国家合同以来，合同履约率年年达100％。武重、武锅、武船克服各种不利因素，宁肯不赚钱也确保国家重点建设项目的急需。以这些“武字号”企业为骨干，加上武汉市自身发展的一大批门类齐全的市属“武字号”，随着经济的发展和改革的深化，贡献越来越大。
    武汉这个祖国腹地的特大中心城市，为湖北在中部崛起显示着举足轻重的作用。
