The governments of China and the Federated States of Micronesia have agreed through friendly consultations to establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level starting from September 11, 1989.

The Federated States of Micronesia is an island nation in the Pacific, located to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands. The country consists of 607 islands, covering an area of 722 square kilometers, spread over more than 2.5 million square kilometers of ocean. The islands are mostly mountainous, with many being volcanic or coral reef types. The climate is tropical, with abundant rainfall and an average annual temperature of 27°C.

The Federated States of Micronesia is divided into four states: Yap, Truk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae, with Pohnpei as the capital. The population is approximately 100,000, mostly Micronesians, with English as the common language. The current president is Tosiwo Nakayama. The country practices a tripartite system of government with executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and a unicameral legislature. According to the constitution, the four states have independent administrative powers, with the governor as the highest administrative official.

Micronesia has a long history. The indigenous inhabitants had contact with Southeast Asian residents as early as the pre-Christian era. In the 16th century, it was discovered by Spanish and Portuguese navigators. In the mid-19th century, Britain, the United States, and Germany successively established trading posts here. In 1885, it was occupied by Spain, and in 1899, it was occupied by Germany. During World War I, it was seized by Japan and became a Japanese colony from 1914 to 1944. During World War II, it was occupied by the U.S. military. In 1947, the United Nations Security Council entrusted Micronesia to the United States. Since 1969, Micronesia has been negotiating with the United States on its future political status. In 1979, the "Federated States of Micronesia" was established, and in 1982, a "Compact of Free Association" was formally signed with the United States. The United States announced the treaty's effectiveness in November 1986. According to the treaty, the Federated States of Micronesia enjoys autonomy in internal and external affairs and can participate in regional organizations, but its security and defense will remain under U.S. responsibility for 15 years.

The Federated States of Micronesia is rich in agricultural products such as coconuts, pepper, and cassava, and has abundant fisheries, particularly known for tuna. Copra, pepper, and tuna are the three main export products.

In recent years, Chinese economic delegations have visited the Federated States of Micronesia for inspections and visits. Last August, President Nakayama visited China as part of the South Pacific Island Countries' Parliamentary Delegation. During his stay in Beijing, Premier Li Peng met with the delegation.

　　密克罗尼西亚联邦
    我国政府和密克罗尼西亚联邦政府通过友好商谈，决定两国从1989年9月11日起建立大使级外交关系。
    密克罗尼西亚联邦是太平洋中的群岛之国，位于夏威夷群岛的西南（见下图）。全国共607个岛屿，面积722平方公里，分布在250多万平方公里的洋面上。岛屿多山地，多为火山型和珊瑚礁型。多雨，年平均气温27℃，热带气候。
    密克罗尼西亚联邦分雅浦、特鲁克、波纳佩和科斯雷四个州，首都波纳佩。人口约10万，多属密克罗尼西亚人，通用英语。现任总统是亚佩斯·约翰·哈格莱尔加姆。国内实行行政、立法、司法三权分立、一院制议会政体。根据宪法，四个州独立掌管行政，州长为州最高行政官员。
    密克罗尼西亚历史久远，当地土著居民早在公元前就与东南亚居民有交往。16世纪，被西班牙和葡萄牙的航海者发现。19世纪中期，英、美、德国先后在此设贸易据点。1885年被西班牙占领，1899年又被德国占领。第一次世界大战期间被日本攻占，自1914年至1944年变成日本的殖民地。二次世界大战中又被美军占领。1947年联合国安理会将密克罗尼西亚交美国托管。自1969年起，密克罗尼西亚开始就未来政治地位问题同美国谈判，1979年成立“密克罗尼西亚联邦”，1982年与美国正式签订《自由联系条约》，美国于1986年11月宣布该条约生效。根据该条约，密克罗尼西亚联邦享有内政、外交自主权，可以参加区域性组织，但其安全和防务在15年内仍由美国负责。密克罗尼西亚联邦盛产椰子、胡椒、木薯等农产品，鱼类资源丰富，尤以金枪鱼著名。椰干、胡椒、金枪鱼是三大出口产品。
    近年来，我国经济团组曾前往密克罗尼西亚联邦考察访问。去年8月，哈格莱尔加姆总统随南太平洋岛国会议代表团访华。在京期间，李鹏总理会见了客人。（冬明文　根华图）（附图片）
