Over the past 40 years, our athletes have won a total of 392 world championships in international sports competitions (as of mid-September 1989). The old China had not won a single world championship.

New China's athletes have set or broken world records 385 times in various events (as of the end of 1988).

Over the past 40 years, mass sports activities have flourished in China, with 400 million people achieving various levels of sports fitness standards.

Old China had only over 4,000 sports facilities, including 132 official stadiums, gymnasiums, and swimming pools. Today, the country has over 520,000 sports facilities, including 5,389 stadiums, gymnasiums, and swimming pools.

Old China sent athletes to participate in the Olympics three times but did not win any medals. Before China resumed its legal seat in the International Olympic Committee in 1979, the best result for athletes from Taiwan was one silver medal. In the 1980s, Chinese athletes took the Olympic stage, participating in the 23rd and 24th Olympics, winning a total of 20 gold medals, 19 silver medals, and 21 bronze medals.

Athletes from Chinese Taipei also participated in these two Olympics, winning one bronze medal.

Currently, China has joined 73 international sports organizations and 37 Asian sports organizations.

The Chinese sports community currently has 152 people holding various leadership positions, including the vice-chairman of the International Olympic Committee, in 35 international sports organizations and 36 Asian sports organizations.
