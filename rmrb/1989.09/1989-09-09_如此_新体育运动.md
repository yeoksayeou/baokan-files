Recently, the French magazine *Position* revealed some materials about the "thieves running rampant" in this country, causing a public uproar. If it were not for the reputation this magazine has enjoyed in the past, people might have thought it was fabricating stories.

First, let's look at the numbers: every year, the value of goods stolen from French stores alone amounts to 20 billion francs.

The psychological state of the thieves is even more shocking. According to an insider, three out of every four thefts are committed by people who "consider themselves honest citizens." They all claim to "obey social order and value their reputation." In a joint survey conducted by the magazine and a research institute, 13% of the respondents admitted to having stolen something, and 80% of middle school students considered stealing from stores to be a "basically normal" phenomenon. When analyzing the reasons behind the rampant thefts, a crime expert pointed out: the first reason is "as old as the world itself," that is, the desire to obtain something one cannot afford at the moment; the second reason is a kind of "near-sportsmanship enthusiasm"; the third reason is being challenged by friends, such as when friends say, "You don't have the guts to do it." The latter two reasons sound a bit absurd, but the seriousness of the problem lies precisely here. When more and more French people sneer at the biblical commandment "Thou shalt not steal," they begin to see theft as a "new sporting event" and attempt to cultivate their "wisdom" and "courage" through stealing.

Therefore, this "new sporting event" is not only prevalent in stores but has also spread to other places such as factories, offices, schools, hotels, and more.

The ranks of those participating in this "new sporting event" are also expanding. However, those who are the subject of public criticism are naturally the "respectable" individuals who were caught red-handed due to their lack of skill. For example, a member of the Cherbourg Bar Association was caught trying to steal a bottle of wine from a store. Three court employees in Lyon made some clumsy moves while sealing off a residence and stole 200,000 francs, only to be quickly arrested. A minister's wife, while visiting Guadeloupe with her husband, casually took a lace bedsheet from the bed in her official residence and stuffed it into her bag. Upon learning of the incident, the island's administrative chief acted rationally and politely. He bought several identical bedsheets from a store and presented them to the "lady," saying, "It is clear that you, madam, appreciate the work of local artisans. I do not want you to keep the used bedsheet as a souvenir, so please accept these new bedsheets." The escalating trend of theft is seriously threatening the mental health of the younger generation. According to a survey, theft occurs "at all educational levels," even in kindergartens where little pickpockets have appeared.

In schools, many children openly bring stolen items from outside to the classroom to trade with each other. Their attitude is: why be afraid? After all, this is a "basically normal behavior"!

### 如此“新体育运动”

    如此“新体育运动”
    不久前，法国《方位》杂志披露了一些有关这个国家“贼满为患”的材料，舆论为之哗然。要不是因为这家杂志以往享有的名望，人们还会以为它在胡编滥造。
    先看数字：每年仅从法国商店里被小偷偷走的商品价值就有二百亿法郎之多。
    偷窃者的心理状态更令人吃惊。据一位知情者说，这些偷窃行为的三分之二是那些“认为自己属于诚实公民”的人干的，他们都说自己“遵守社会秩序，并且重视自己的名声”。在这家杂志与一个研究所联合搞的问询调查中，百分之十三的人承认自己偷过东西，百分之八十的中学生则认为在商店里偷东西是一种
  “基本上正常”的现象。在分析偷窃成风的原因时，一位犯罪问题专家指出：第一个原因“像世界一样古老”，即获取某件一时买不起的物品的愿望；第二个原因是某种“近乎体育运动的热情”；第三个原因是受到朋友的“激将”，比如朋友们说：“你没能力干这种事。”后两个原因让人听起来感到有点荒唐，然而问题的严重性正是在这里。当越来越多的法国人对《圣经》上
  “不要偷东西”的训诫嗤之以鼻时，他们便把偷东西看成是一种
  “新的体育运动项目”，并且试图通过偷东西来锻炼自己的“智慧”和“胆量”。
    因此，这一“新的体育运动项目”不仅仅在商店里得到普及，而且还蔓延到其它地方，如工厂、机关、学校、旅馆……
    从事“新的体育运动项目”队伍也在扩大。不过，让人说三道四的自然还是那些因功夫不到家现了眼的“体面人”。如瑟堡律师公会的一个成员在商店里试图偷一瓶酒时被当场捉住。里昂的三名法院工作人员在查封一个住宅时做了些笨手脚，合伙偷走二十万法郎，很快因东窗事发而锒铛入狱。一位部长夫人随丈夫对瓜德罗普岛做巡视旅行时，在其下榻的官邸里顺手牵羊，将床上的透花床单塞进提包。该岛的行政长官得知此事后表现得理智而彬彬有礼。他从商店里买了几个同样的床单呈送给这位“贵夫人”，并对她说：“看得出夫人您很赏识本地艺人的作品。我不愿意您把用过的床单收藏起来当做纪念品，请您接受这些新床单。”愈刮愈烈的偷窃风正严重威胁着年轻一代的思想健康。据调查，偷窃行为“在所有教育层次上”都有，甚至连幼儿园里也出现了小扒手。
    在学校里，许多孩子公开把从外面偷来的东西拿到教室里互相买卖。他们的心态是：怕什么？反正这是
  “基本上正常的行为”！
