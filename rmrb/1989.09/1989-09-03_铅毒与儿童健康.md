Lead poisoning poses a serious threat to children's health. Even a small amount of this metal stored in the body can damage the brain and other organs of both children and adults. Although this fact has been noted by the medical community, due to the lack of convenient diagnostic methods, lead levels have not been included as a primary check in health examinations.

Recently, doctors at the Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York State designed a low-energy X-ray machine. By scanning bones close to the skin (such as the femur), the machine can measure the lead content in the bones. This result is the same as that obtained by injecting EDTA and then performing an X-ray. Currently, the operation time for this machine is sixteen minutes, which is difficult for active children to endure. The designers are working to reduce the operation time to less than five minutes. In the past, doctors used to inject "ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid" (EDTA) into patients to draw lead out of the bones and form a compound that is excreted in the urine. Doctors then checked the lead content in the urine for treatment. This treatment procedure is both complicated and painful for the patient, and requires a three-day hospital stay.

The advent of this X-ray machine will allow doctors not only to measure the levels of other metal elements in the body (such as strontium, copper, zinc, iron, chromium) but also to study the adverse effects of high lead levels in pregnant women on the fetus. This will provide sufficient grounds to advise married women showing signs of lead poisoning to undergo treatment to reduce lead levels before considering pregnancy.

    铅毒与儿童健康
    铅毒严重威胁着儿童的健康，极少量的这种金属元素存储于体内，也会对儿童甚至成人的大脑和其他器官造成损害。这个事实虽然受到医学界的注意，由于缺乏简便的诊疗手段，铅含量未能在健康检查中列为主要检查项目。
    最近，美国纽约州石溪大学医院的医生设计了一台低能源透视仪。只要对接近皮肤的骨头（如股骨）进行扫描，即可测出骨内的铅含量。这与注射EDTA后再透视的测量结果相同。目前，这种透视仪器的操作时间需要十六分钟，这对好动的儿童是很难忍受的。设计者正设法使仪器操作时间缩短到五分钟以下。过去，医生采用的办法是对患者进行静脉注射“乙二胺四乙酸”，将铅元素从骨头吸出并形成一种混合物由尿液排出体外，医生再从尿液查验铅含量以便治疗。这种治疗程序既繁复又使患者痛苦，而且需要住院三天。
    这种透视仪的出现，将使医生们不但可以测量人体内其他金属元素（如锶、铜、锌、铁、铬）的含量，也可以研究铅含量高的孕妇对胎儿的不良影响，从而可有充分理由劝告呈现铅毒征候的已婚妇女先作降低铅含量治疗之后再考虑生育。　·陈封·
