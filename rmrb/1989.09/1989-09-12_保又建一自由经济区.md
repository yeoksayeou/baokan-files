Bulgaria has established another "duty-free free economic zone" in the important Black Sea port and industrial city of Burgas.

Recently, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers passed a resolution to establish a "duty-free free economic zone" in Burgas. This is the third such zone in Bulgaria, following the ones established in the cities of Ruse and Vidin on the Danube River. According to the zone's director, H. Rakhnov, the newly established economic zone will be structured as a joint-stock enterprise, primarily relying on investments from Bulgarian and foreign companies. It is particularly hoped that several large industrial enterprises in the area will actively participate in the initial stages of its establishment.

The main purpose of establishing this economic zone is to attract foreign capital and introduce advanced technologies from around the world to produce various products that are competitive in the international market.

There are many favorable conditions for establishing this type of economic zone in Burgas. It is one of the main transportation hubs in Bulgaria. The city has the country's largest petrochemical enterprise and more than a hundred state-owned, joint-venture companies and enterprises, cooperatives, and research institutions.

　　保又建一自由经济区
    保加利亚在黑海重要港口和工业城市布尔加斯市又建立了一个“无关税自由经济区”。
    不久前，保加利亚部长会议通过决议，决定在布尔加斯市建立“无关税自由经济区”。这是保加利亚继在多瑙河畔的鲁塞和维丁两市建立后的第三个“无关税自由经济区”。据该经济区负责人赫·拉赫内夫说，新建的经济区的形式是股份制，主要靠保加利亚和外国公司作为股东投资共建。特别希望当地的几家大的工业企业在创建初期积极入股。
    建立这一经济区的主要目的是吸收外资和引进世界先进技术，生产各种在国际市场上具有竞争能力的产品。
    在布尔加斯建立这类经济区具有很多有利条件，它是保加利亚交通运输主要枢纽之一。这里有全国最大的石油化工企业并有上百家国营、合营公司和企业、合作社及科研单位。（新华社）
