The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the State Taxation Administration have issued a notice to conduct tax law education among individual industrial and commercial households.

According to a report from our Beijing correspondent, Wang Jinhua, to implement the State Council's "Decision on Strengthening Tax Administration for Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Households and Private Enterprises," the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the State Taxation Administration have decided to launch a campaign to promote and popularize tax law education among individual industrial and commercial households nationwide.

It is understood that among the current 23 million individual laborers in the country, more than 70% are young people. Liu Yandong, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said today that it is the duty and responsibility of the Communist Youth League organizations to promote tax law education and popularize tax knowledge among the broad masses of individual laborers, especially the young people among them. She urged all levels of Youth League organizations to fully leverage their advantages to do a good job in this meaningful work, and to take it as a practical matter to support government departments.

Golden Jin, Director of the State Taxation Administration, hopes that through this activity, the young people among individual taxpayers will be united, educated, and inspired to love their country, strive for progress, abide by the law, pay taxes according to the law, and make conscious contributions to the modernization of socialism.

    团中央国家税务局发出通知
    对个体工商户开展税法教育
    本报北京9月4日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：为贯彻国务院《关于大力加强城乡个体工商户和私营企业税收征管工作的决定》，共青团中央、国家税务局决定，在全国个体工商户中开展税法宣传普及教育活动。
    据了解，目前全国2300万个体劳动者中，青年占70％以上。共青团中央书记处书记刘延东今天在此间说，向广大个体劳动者，特别是他们中的青年人宣传税法，进行税务知识普及教育，是共青团组织义不容辞的责任和义务。她要求各级团组织充分发挥自己的优势做好这件意义深远的工作，作为团组织配合政府部门做的一件实事来抓。国家税务局局长金鑫希望通过这一活动，团结教育和启发个体纳税户中的青年人热爱祖国，奋发向上，遵纪守法，照章纳税，自觉地为社会主义现代化建设作出贡献。
