After your newspaper published the letter "The Dangers of Homemade Guns and Cannons" on March 11, the county committee and government of Yongxing immediately decided to send County Committee Deputy Secretary He Tongsheng to lead a team of 80 people to the severely affected town of Madian for rectification. The county government also issued a "Notice on the Seizure of Weapons." By the end of May, our county had confiscated a total of 396 homemade guns and 71 homemade cannons, and dealt with 69 individuals who had used these weapons to commit illegal and criminal activities.
