Recently, some young people have casually discussed the issue of colonial rule, even suggesting that being a colony is not so bad, as Africa is developing now. What consequences did colonial rule really bring to Africa? The renowned British African historian Basil Davidson's "Modern African History" (published by the Chinese Social Sciences Press in 1989) can provide some enlightenment.

The Western powers began to divide Africa and implement large-scale colonial rule at the end of the 19th century. In the early and mid-19th century, many areas of African society had undergone some key transformations. However, these transformations were not completed and were instead destroyed by the colonial system. One innovator after another was crushed under the wheels of colonial policy. After suppressing the resistance of the African people, the Western powers established colonial economic systems in various colonies. This system divided Africa into two types of regions. The first type of region was for the production of minerals and cash crops for export, with a very limited geographical area. All European investments at the time were concentrated in these regions. The second type of region was all other areas, whose function was to provide cheap labor and food to the "export production areas." In "Modern African History," the author examines the operation of the colonial economic system from the perspectives of labor, land, and trade.

In the early days of colonial rule, labor was solved through the corvée system. Workers were quietly taken from various villages, and later they were recruited through chiefs, with forced measures being very common. The Congo-Ocean Railway was basically built by forcibly conscripting over 120,000 strong adult men between 1921 and 1932. According to official statistics, before working conditions slightly improved in 1928, more than 10,000 people died, and another 3,900 died after 1928. At the other end of the continent, the secretary of the Italian Fascist Party in Somalia admitted in a report to Mussolini in the early 1930s that forced labor had developed to a point far worse than slavery.

Because these forced measures were insufficient to meet the needs and often provoked resistance, the colonial authorities then enacted laws to levy cash taxes, forcing Africans to earn money to pay taxes. In that era, this undoubtedly meant they had to leave their villages and work for Europeans. If they could not pay the taxes, they would naturally be punished and become prisoners doing forced labor. The registered African workers in Kenya earned a total of 1 million pounds per year. Taking the period from 1920 to 1923 as an example, their direct and indirect taxes amounted to 750,000 pounds, leaving only 1/4 of the income for the workers.

During the colonial rule period, wherever there were large numbers of white settlers, the authorities took measures to expropriate land from Africans, forcing self-sufficient farmers to become proletarians and be driven into a labor market where they had no bargaining power. In Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), nearly half of the land was designated as white settlement areas, with about 1/4 of the land "reserved" for Africans. Naturally, the whites got the best land. In Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), about 1 million African farmers had only 71 million acres of land, while a few hundred white farmers owned 90 million acres of land. Land expropriation and labor exploitation went hand in hand. In the mid-1920s, about half of the strong men from the Kikuyu and Luo tribes worked for Europeans. Similar examples can be found in Tanganyika (Tanzania), Angola, Mozambique, and Nyasaland (Malawi).

In terms of trade, the main feature of the colonial system was to transfer monopoly rights from Africans to Europeans. Therefore, although some elements of African capitalism had appeared before the 1880s, the process of further significant development was at least delayed by 75 years, and the same was true for other economic sectors.

In summary, through the supra-economic means of colonial rule, the Western powers completely integrated the colonial economies into the European economic orbit. Throughout this period, "development" meant the growth of Europe's overseas extensions and did not mean, nor did it show any signs of, the transformation of African society from "backward" to "advanced." On the contrary, "colonization" often led to "extermination," which is also proven by the history of most countries in Africa and the Third World.

The economic system formed during the colonial rule period did not fundamentally change with independence but, as a heavy legacy, deeply influenced the subsequent historical process of Africa, becoming the main cause of the structural crisis that has accompanied decolonization since the 1950s and has become increasingly severe.

    殖民统治给非洲带来了什么？
    ——读《现代非洲史》
    钟　菲
    前一段时间，有些青年人曾以若无其事的口吻议论殖民统治问题，甚至认为，沦为殖民地有什么要紧，非洲现在还不是都发展起来了。殖民统治究竟给非洲带来了什么后果？英国著名非洲史学家巴兹尔·戴维逊的《现代非洲史》（中国社会科学出版社1989年出版）可以给人以启迪。
    西方列强瓜分非洲，开始大规模推行殖民统治是在十九世纪末。十九世纪初叶和中叶，非洲社会许多领域曾经发生过某些关键性的变革。然而，这些变革尚未完成就被殖民制度所葬送，一个个革新者都被殖民政策的车轮碾得粉碎。西方列强在镇压了非洲人民的反抗后，在各殖民地相继建立起殖民经济体制。这种体制使非洲形成了两类地区。第一种地区是为出口服务的矿产和经济作物生产区，其地域面积极为有限，当时数量不大的欧洲投资全都投入这类地区。第二种地区是所有其他地区，其作用是向“出口生产区”提供廉价劳工和食品。在《现代非洲史》一书中，作者从劳力、土地和贸易三个方面考察了殖民经济体制的运行情况。
    在殖民统治的初期，劳力是靠劳役制来解决的。劳工是悄悄地从各处村庄直接弄到手的，后来则通过酋长去征募，采用强制手段的做法很普遍。刚果——大西洋铁路基本上就是靠强行征用12万多名强壮成年男子，在1921—1932年间修筑起来的。按官方统计，在1928年劳动条件略有改善之前，共有1万多人死亡，1928年以后又死了3900人。在大陆的另一端，驻索马里的意大利法西斯党秘书长30年代初在给墨索里尼的报告中也承认，强制作法已经发展到远远不如奴隶制的地步。
    由于这种强制措施不足以满足需要，而且往往招致反抗，殖民当局又通过法令规定征收现金税，迫使非洲人为了付税而不得不去挣取现金。在那个时代，这无疑意味着他们得离开村庄而受雇于欧洲人。如果他们不能付清税款，自然要受到惩罚，就会成为服苦役的囚犯。肯尼亚正式注册的非洲人就业者每年的收入共计100万英镑，以1920—1923年期间为例，他们每年的直接税和间接税要占去75万英镑，仅有1／4的收入归劳动者所得。
    在殖民统治时期，凡有大量白人移民的地方，当局都采取了剥夺非洲人土地的措施，这就迫使自给自足的农民成为无产者并被赶入一个他们毫无讨价还价余地的劳动力市场。在南罗得西亚（津巴布韦），近一半的土地划为白人定居区，“保留”约1／4的土地划归非洲人，白人自然分到最好的土地。在北罗得西亚（赞比亚），大约100万非洲农民只有7100万英亩土地，而几百个白人农夫却拥有900万英亩土地。对土地剥夺和对劳动力的剥削同步进行。20年代中期，基库尤族和卢奥族约有一半强壮男子为欧洲人干活。同一类例子在坦噶尼喀（坦桑尼亚）、安哥拉、莫桑比克、尼亚萨兰（马拉维）比比皆是。
    在贸易方面，殖民制度的主要特征是将垄断权从非洲人手里转到欧洲人手中。因此，某种非洲资本主义的因素虽在十九世纪80年代以前即已出现，然而进一步取得重大发展的进程却至少被推迟了75年左右，其他经济领域的发展也是如此。
    总之，通过殖民统治的超经济手段，西方列强将殖民地经济完全纳入欧洲经济的轨道。在整个这一时期，“发展”意味着欧洲在海外延伸部分的增长，并不意味也从未有迹象表明是非洲社会从“落后”向“先进”的转化。恰恰相反，“殖民”往往导致“灭民”，这也是非洲乃至第三世界大多数国家历史所证明了的。
    殖民统治时期形成的经济体制并没有随着独立的到来而发生根本改变，而是作为一份沉重的遗产对非洲后来的历史进程产生了深刻的影响，成为50年代以来伴随非殖民化而来并且日益严重的结构性危机的主要原因。
