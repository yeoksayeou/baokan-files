Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th.

Beijing's fiscal revenue has shown a steady rebound since July. The fiscal revenue for July and August amounted to 13.1 billion yuan, a 77% increase compared to May and June.

Since 1983, Beijing's fiscal revenue has increased steadily for five consecutive years. However, due to the impact of the disturbances and riots in May and June this year, the fiscal revenue dropped sharply, breaking the five-year trend of continuous growth. To address this, the Beijing Municipal Finance Department and other relevant departments dispatched personnel to enterprises, helping them implement reform measures and promote production development through the "double increase, double savings" campaign. These efforts have already yielded significant results.

　　北京财政收入回升
    新华社北京9月11日电　（记者阎振国）北京市7月份以来财政收入已出现稳步回升的好形势，7、8两个月的财政收入为13.1亿元，比5、6两个月增收77％。
    自1983年以来，北京市的财政收入连续5年稳定增加。但进入今年5、6月份后，由于动乱和暴乱的影响，财政收入陡然下降，连续5年上升的局面第一次被打破。北京市财政等部门因此派员深入企业，帮助企业落实改革措施，开展双增双节活动，促进生产发展。目前，这些措施已结出丰硕果实。
