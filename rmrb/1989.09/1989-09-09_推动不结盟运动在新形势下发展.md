The ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement concluded successfully in Belgrade on September 8. Delegations from 101 non-aligned countries, as well as nearly 70 observer or guest countries, attended the conference. The meeting held heated discussions on the current international situation and adopted a declaration and 40 thematic political and economic documents. This unprecedented conference was held at a pivotal moment in international affairs, marking a new chapter in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement and undoubtedly having an important impact on its future development.

The Non-Aligned Movement has gone through 28 years. Over these 28 years, it has raised the banner of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and anti-hegemony, making significant contributions to maintaining world peace, promoting national liberation, and fostering international cooperation. Its growth and development have shown that the newly independent nations that emerged after World War II do not wish to be swept along by the fierce competition for hegemony between the superpowers, nor do they want to be mere appendages of the great powers. Instead, they are determined to unite on the principles of independence, non-alignment, and non-alignment with any bloc, to take control of their own destinies, and to have a voice in international affairs. The 28-year history of the Non-Aligned Movement further proves that it has become an important political force on the international stage, playing an increasingly significant role in international affairs.

Currently, the international situation is undergoing significant changes, with a trend towards dialogue and a shift from tension to relaxation. Peace and development have become the main themes of the times. In this context, many non-aligned countries have called for the Non-Aligned Movement to adapt to the changing situation and chart its future development direction. As pointed out by the chairman of the conference, the chairman of the Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia, Dejan Djurović, "The changes in the world situation require all factors in international relations to quickly adapt to the new global trends, and the Non-Aligned Movement is no exception. Apart from issues of peace, security, and disarmament, the most important issue for non-aligned countries is the issue of development.... The Non-Aligned Movement must modernize." Most non-aligned countries are developing countries, and they all face varying degrees of severe economic problems, especially debt problems. Many leaders of non-aligned countries mentioned the deteriorating economic situation and debt crisis facing developing countries in their speeches and proposed various positive suggestions. They particularly emphasized the need to promote global dialogue between the South and the North, strengthen South-South cooperation, and advocate for unity and long-term cooperation within non-aligned countries. All of this undoubtedly has great significance. The economic difficulties currently faced by the vast majority of developing countries are largely the result of the self-serving economic policies of developed countries. Although developing countries have repeatedly called for a change in this situation and for South-North dialogue, the negative attitudes of developed countries have caused the issue to be delayed until now. It can be said that the time has come to urgently address this issue. The documents adopted by the conference place the struggle for peace and development, the safeguarding of security and independence, and the development of the economy, the resolution of the debt crisis, and the establishment of a new international economic order in an important position, which seems timely. It reflects the urgent desire of the people of non-aligned countries to build their countries and improve their economies in a peaceful environment.

Adhering to the basic principles of the Non-Aligned Movement is also a recurring theme emphasized at this summit. The reason the Non-Aligned Movement has vitality, and its membership has grown from the original 25 countries to the current 102 countries, is mainly because it has adhered to the basic principles of "independence, non-alignment, and non-alignment with any bloc" and has adhered to the purpose of "anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, anti-hegemony, and support for national liberation movements." It should be noted that although the international situation is tending towards relaxation, the factors that cause tension and turmoil have not been eliminated. Hegemonism still exists, the competition between the two superpowers continues, and their arms race has not stopped. Although the "hotspots" have cooled down, the fundamental contradictions have not been eliminated. The serious economic situation continues to cause social unrest in developing countries, and the increasingly prominent North-South contradictions are not conducive to world stability. This requires non-aligned countries to continue to adhere to the correct direction of "independence, non-alignment, and non-alignment with any bloc," strengthen unity, and take joint action to further ease the international situation, promote South-South cooperation and South-North dialogue, and work tirelessly to establish a new international political and economic order.

China has always sympathized with and supported the Non-Aligned Movement and highly appreciates the principles and purposes of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Chinese people, who pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, will join the people of the vast non-aligned countries to jointly struggle for the maintenance of world peace, the promotion of economic development, and the progress of human civilization.

    推动不结盟运动在新形势下发展
    本报评论员
    第九次不结盟国家首脑会议已于9月8日在贝尔格莱德胜利闭幕。来自101个不结盟国家的代表团以及近70个国家的观察员或来宾出席了大会。会议对当前国际形势进行了热烈的讨论，通过了一项宣言和40个专题性政治和经济文件。这次盛况空前的大会是在国际形势发生转折的时刻召开的，它揭开了不结盟运动史新的一页，对不结盟运动今后的发展无疑会产生重要的影响。
    不结盟运动已经经历了28个春秋。28年来，它高举反帝、反殖、反霸的旗帜，为维护世界和平、推动民族解放事业、促进国际合作作出了重大的贡献。它的成长和发展表明，战后新兴的民族独立国家不愿在超级大国为谋求霸权的激烈角逐中随波逐流，不甘心充当大国的附庸，决心在“独立自主、不结盟、非集团”的原则基础上联合起来，自己掌握自己的命运，在国际事务中发出自己的声音。不结盟运动28年的光辉历程进一步证明，它已经成为一支重要政治力量登上了国际舞台，在国际事务中发挥着越来越重要的作用。
    目前，国际形势正在发生转折性的变化，对话的趋势正在普遍发展，紧张正在转向缓和。和平与发展已成为当今时代的主流。在此情势下，许多不结盟国家要求不结盟运动根据形势的变化部署今后的发展方向。正如本次会议主席南斯拉夫联邦主席团主席德尔诺夫舍克在会上所指出，“世界形势的变化要求国际关系中所有的因素迅速适应新的世界潮流，不结盟运动也不例外。除了和平、安全和裁军问题外，不结盟国家最重要的问题是发展问题。……不结盟运动必须实行现代化。”不结盟国家大都是发展中国家，它们几乎都程度不同地面临严峻的经济问题，特别是债务问题。不少不结盟国家领导人在发言中都谈到了当前发展中国家恶化的经济形势和债务危机，并提出了各种积极的建议。他们特别强调要推动南北之间进行全球性对话，加强南南合作，主张发展不结盟国家内部的团结与长期的合作。这一切无疑有着重大的意义。目前广大的发展中国家所面临的经济困难，很大程度上是发达国家的利己的经济政策造成的。尽管发展中国家屡屡提出改变这种情况，要求南北对话，但由于发达国家采取消极态度，致使事情一直拖延至今，应该说现在已经到了迫切需要解决的时候了。会议通过的文件把争取和平与发展、保障安全与独立确定为不结盟运动今后的首要任务，并把发展经济、解决债务危机和建立国际经济新秩序置于重要地位，看来是切合时宜的，它反映了不结盟国家人民迫切要求在和平环境中建设国家和改善经济的良好愿望。
    坚持不结盟运动的基本原则，也是这次首脑会议反复强调的主题。不结盟运动之所以具有生命力，其成员从最初的25国增加到了现在的102国，主要就是因为它坚持了“独立自主、不结盟、非集团”的基本原则，坚持了“反帝、反殖、反霸和支持民族解放运动”的宗旨。应该看到，国际形势虽然趋向缓和，但导致形势紧张、动荡的各种因素并没有消除，霸权主义仍然存在，两个超级大国的争夺还在继续，它们之间的军备竞赛也未停止，“热点”地区虽然有所降温，却并未消除根本矛盾，而严重的经济形势又不断导致发展中国家发生社会动荡，越来越突出的南北矛盾也不利于世界的稳定。这就需要不结盟国家继续坚持“独立自主、不结盟、非集团”的正确方向，加强团结，共同行动，为进一步缓和国际局势，促进南南合作与南北对话，建立国际政治、经济新秩序而进行不懈的努力。
    中国一贯同情和支持不结盟运动，高度赞赏不结盟运动的上述原则和宗旨。奉行独立自主的和平外交政策的中国人民，将同广大不结盟国家人民一起，为维护世界和平、促进经济发展和人类进步事业而共同战斗。
