The growth of minority cadres

    "To thoroughly solve the nationalities problem and completely isolate the nationalities reactionaries, it is impossible without a large number of Communist cadres from the nationalities." This was an important instruction given by Comrade Mao Zedong in December 1949 when he was reviewing a document from Qinghai Province. In the nearly 40 years since this instruction was issued, the Party committees and governments at various levels in Qinghai Province, where multiple nationalities including Han, Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar, and Mongol reside, have spared no effort in training and appointing minority cadres.

    By the end of 1988, Qinghai Province had 31,461 minority cadres, accounting for 21% of the total number of cadres in the province; among the minority cadres, there were 10,535 Party members, accounting for 19% of the total number of Party cadres in the province. Among them, minority cadres holding leadership positions at the provincial, bureau (department), county (division), and section levels accounted for 39%, 36%, 50%, and 36% of the total number of cadres at each level in the province, respectively.

    Over the past decade of reform, Qinghai has adopted various methods such as training, further education, and supplementary education to further strengthen the training of minority cadres, resulting in a favorable change in the professional and technical structure of the minority cadre team. The number of minority technical cadres of all kinds in the province now accounts for nearly half of the total number of minority cadres in the province. Currently, there are 680 minority cadres with senior professional titles, 8,508 with intermediate professional titles, and 3,948 with primary professional titles in the province.

　　少数民族干部茁壮成长
    “要彻底解决民族问题，完全孤立民族反动派，没有大批从少数民族出身的共产主义干部，是不可能的。”这是毛泽东同志于1949年12月在批阅青海省的一个文件时所作的重要指示。指示作出以后的近40年来，在汉、藏、回、土、撒拉、蒙古等多民族聚居的青海省，各级党组织和政府下大力气开展了培养和任用少数民族干部的工作。
    截至1988年底，青海省已有少数民族干部31461人，占全省干部总数的21％；少数民族干部中有党员10535人，占全省党员干部总数的19％。其中，担任省级、厅（局）级、县（处）级、科级领导的少数民族干部，已分别占全省各级干部总数的39％、36％、50％和36％。
    在改革的10年间，青海采用培训、进修、补习等多种方式，进一步加强了培养少数民族干部的工作，使少数民族干部队伍的专业技术结构也发生了可喜变化。全省各类少数民族技术干部已占全省少数民族干部总数的近一半。目前，全省少数民族干部中取得高级职称的有680人，取得中级职称的有8508人，取得初级职称的3948人。　（董国光）
