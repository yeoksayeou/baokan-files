	Pioneers of Technological Innovation

	“Conqueror of Hepatitis A” Mao Jiangsen

	This researcher from the Zhejiang Provincial Medical Academy, along with his team and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, spent 10 years jointly developing the world's first "conqueror of Hepatitis A."

	Last spring, when Hepatitis A was rampant in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the diagnostic reagents they developed showed good immune effects when injected into some workers. Through epidemiological evaluation, it was proven that the vaccine had a 100% protective effect, and the vaccine antibodies could persist.

	The trial production of the vaccine has begun. Hepatitis A, which has seriously endangered the health of the people in our country and the Third World, will soon be effectively controlled.

	“Electromechanical Knight” Wen Bangyan

	The director of Yongjia City's Yongjiu Electromechanical Factory is a technological "individual entrepreneur." In 1987, his invention of a multifunctional composite electromagnetic valve won a gold medal at the 16th International Invention Expo; half a year later, he had three more inventions awarded the Individual Invention Knight Medal at the Eureka World Invention Expo. Now, he has 15 inventions in the fields of electromagnetic valves and temperature control instruments, of which 11 are recorded in world patent literature.

	“Master of Hair Beauty” Zhao Zhanguang

	His invention, the "101" series of hair regeneration essence, is renowned worldwide as the "Eastern Magic Water." He became a famous "Master of Hair Beauty."

	He journeyed from the foothills of Yandang Mountain to the world's invention award stage, wearing a "First Class Knight Medal" from the Eureka World Invention Expo; his hands held the "Oscar Gold Cup" awarded by the Geneva New Technology and Invention Exhibition and the highest honor of the Paris International Invention Expo—the Chamber of Commerce Gold Cup.

    摘取科技明珠的人
   “甲肝克星”毛江森
    这位浙江省医科院研究员带领的攻关组和中国医学科学院合作，历时10年，共同研制成功世界上第一个“甲肝克星”。
    去年春，江浙一带甲肝流行时，他们研制的甲肝诊断试剂在一些职工身上注射后，产生了较好的免疫力。通过流行病学的考核，证明疫苗有100％的保护作用，疫苗抗体可持续存在。
    疫苗的中试生产已经开始。曾严重危害我国和第三世界人民健康的“甲肝”，即将得到有效的控制。
    机电“骑士”温邦彦
    瑞安市永久机电厂厂长是个科技“个体户”。一九八七年，他发明的多功能组合电磁阀，在第十六届国际发明博览会上获金奖；半年之后，他又有三项发明在尤里卡世界发明博览会上获个人发明骑士勋章。如今，他在电磁阀、温控仪表等方面，已有十五项发明创造，其中十一项记载在世界专利文献中。
    “美发大师”赵章光
    他发明的“101”系列毛发再生精是饮誉海外的“东方魔水”。他成了著名的“美发大师”。
    他从雁荡山麓走向世界发明者的领奖台，胸前挂着一枚尤里卡世界发明博览会个人发明“一等骑士勋章”；他的双手捧着日内瓦新技术新发明展览会奖给的“奥斯卡金杯”和巴黎国际发明博览会最高荣誉奖——工商会金杯。（附图片）
