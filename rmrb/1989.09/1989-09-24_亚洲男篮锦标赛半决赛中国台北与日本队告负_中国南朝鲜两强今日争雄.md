Indeed, as expected, the final match for the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship will be between China and South Korea tomorrow. Taiwan and Japan will compete for third place. In tonight's semifinals, China defeated Taiwan 92:67, and South Korea defeated Japan 100:86.

The match between the two teams from both sides of the Taiwan Strait saw both sides holding back. Taiwan, being weaker than China, did not exert full effort. In the second half, both teams substituted their main players.

In contrast, the match between South Korea and Japan was full of twists and turns.

In the first half, the scores were very close for the first 10 minutes, with a difference of only one or two points. After that, South Korea strengthened their outside attacks, leading 53:39 at the end of the first half. In the second half, South Korea continued to expand their lead, at one point leading by about 20 points. However, 10 minutes later, Japan launched one fast attack after another, narrowing the gap to 80:83 with 4 minutes left. Unfortunately, Japan became a bit impatient in this situation, while South Korea's veterans, number 6 Lee Chung-hee and number 10 Kim Hyun-jun, consecutively scored several 3-pointers. In the final 3 minutes, Japan scored only 3 points, while South Korea scored 17.

China and South Korea are old rivals. Although China has won more matches in the past, they have lost several times to South Korea since the Olympics. The newly formed Chinese team's chances of defending their title this time naturally attract attention. From the performance of both teams in this championship, the young Chinese team, as long as they perform normally on the court, should have a good chance of defeating South Korea.

    亚洲男篮锦标赛半决赛中国台北与日本队告负
    中国南朝鲜两强今日争雄
    本报北京9月23日讯　记者陈昭报道：果然不出人们所料，第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛的夺冠压轴戏将于明日在中国队和南朝鲜队之间进行。中国台北队将和日本队争夺第三名。在今晚的半决赛中，中国队以92∶67胜中国台北队，南朝鲜队以100∶86胜日本队。
    海峡两岸两支球队的比赛双方均有所保留。中国台北队由于实力弱于中国队，因而也就没有力拚。下半时，双方均将主力阵容换下。
    反之，南朝鲜队与日本队的比赛却是一波三折。
    上半时前10分钟内，两队比分一直咬得很紧，相差仅一两分。此后南朝鲜队加强了外线进攻，上半时结束时以53∶39领先。下半时开场后南朝鲜队继续扩大战果，一度领先20分左右。未料10分钟后，日本队发起一次又一次快攻，至终场前4分钟时，把比分追成80∶83。可惜的是日本队在这种情况下打得有些急躁，而南朝鲜老将6号李忠熙和10号金贤俊连续几个3分球命中。最后3分多钟，日本队仅得3分，而南朝鲜队却得了17分。
    中国队和南朝鲜队是老对手，尽管过去中国队胜多负少，但自奥运会以来，却几次败于对方，新组建的中国队此次能否卫冕，自然为人们所关注。从本届锦标赛两队的表现来看，年轻的中国队只要临场发挥正常，战胜南朝鲜队的把握应该是较大的。
