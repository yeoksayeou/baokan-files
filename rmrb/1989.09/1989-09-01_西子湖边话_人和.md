	West Lake in Hangzhou, a paradise for tourists in China, saw a summer of blooming lotuses with a fragrance that spread for miles; however, the number of overseas tourists was low. Although August saw a recovery, the numbers were still modest. I was heading to Hangzhou, thinking it would be a good opportunity to stay in an air-conditioned room at the Overseas Chinese Hotel for free, since it was empty anyway, and we're old friends. To my surprise, upon inquiring, I was told, "Today's occupancy rate is ninety-three percent, and by evening, it might be full." Really? I asked a familiar floor service staff member for details. The girls proudly said, "In June, all the major hotels in Hangzhou were losing money, some losing a million or two, but we made ten million." "In July, the occupancy rate averaged eighty percent, and we made forty million." "In August... look, there are more foreigners."

	Business is booming here.

	Is it because of the location? The Overseas Chinese Hotel is indeed in a good location. It faces West Lake and is close to the bustling city center, making it convenient for sightseeing and shopping. But Hangzhou has more than one hotel like this. Is it because of the recent renovations and new facilities, with reasonable room prices? The newly built luxury hotels have even better conditions. A public relations officer at the hotel revealed the key: "In early July, a Chinese overseas resident called from Hong Kong and asked me, 'Is Hangzhou really safe?' I said, 'Yes, it is!' He said, 'If you say it's safe, I believe it.' Then he came. Just as our general manager, Mr. Xu, said, 'Geographical advantage is not as good as harmony among people!'"

	I was deeply moved. Harmony among people is the most valued principle of governance by China's sage rulers and wise ministers. Although the Overseas Chinese Hotel is small, it indeed practices this principle. Their service is a blend of "local and foreign." It has the scientific and standardized modern Western approach, as well as some traditional Chinese human touch that larger hotels might overlook. The female service staff can buy things on the street for weak travelers, take care of children for busy travelers, and search all over Hangzhou for travelers looking for relatives. A Japanese tourist did not leave the room for lunch and dinner, and the service staff noticed, "alerted," and went to check. They found the tourist unconscious in bed, and fortunately, timely rescue turned the situation around. Later, the tourist's parents flew from Tokyo to express their gratitude. Therefore, "If you say it's safe, I believe it."

	The small test during the turmoil, a loss and a gain, the value of "harmony among people" at the Overseas Chinese Hotel is worth more than a million.

    西子湖边话“人和”
    石言
    杭州，中国旅游的天堂，今夏又是荷花盛开，浓香十里；但海外游客却少，8月份虽有恢复，也还平平。我出发杭州，心想正好到华侨饭店去白住个空调房间，反正你空着吗，咱们老朋友了。谁知探问之下，“今天租房率百分之九十三，到晚可能客满。”当真？我向熟悉的楼面服务员细问。姑娘们自豪地说：“6月份杭州旅游大饭店家家赔钱，有的赔了一两百万，我们还赚了十万。”“7月份租房率平均百分之八十，赚了四十万。”“8月份……你看高鼻子也多了。”
    生意这边独好。
    因为地段好吗？华侨饭店的地段确好。面西湖背闹市，游览采购两便。但类似的宾馆杭州非此一家。因为经过改建装新，有了上等设备而房价又适宜吗？那新建的豪华宾馆条件更好。饭店的一位公关人员道破了真谛：“7月初，有位华侨从香港打电话问我：杭州到底太平不太平？我说：太平！他说：你说太平我相信。接着他就来了。正像我们徐总经理说的：地利不如人和嘛！”
    我很有触动。人和，这是中国圣君贤相最重视的治理之道。华侨饭店虽小，的确力行此道。他们的服务是“土洋结合”的。既有西方现代化的科学规范，又有某些大饭店所不屑的中国传统的人情。女服务员们可以为体弱的旅客上街买东西，可以为办事的旅客看管小孩，可以为寻找亲人的旅客跑遍杭州。一位日本旅客中晚两餐未出房吃饭，服务员姑娘
  “警惕”了，主动去察看，发现旅客昏卧在床，幸亏抢救及时转危为安。事后，这位旅客的父母从东京飞来致谢。因此，“你说太平我相信”。
    大动乱中的小小考验，一亏一盈，华侨饭店的“人和”价值何止百万。
