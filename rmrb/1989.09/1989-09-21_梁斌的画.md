Liang Bin's literary works vividly depict the historical turmoil of modern Chinese peasant revolutions. Mao Dun once told Liang Bin, "These are milestone works." Liang Bin is a renowned modern literary figure. His achievements were recognized in the 1950s, and he is widely acknowledged as a master of his generation, influencing a whole cohort of writers. Therefore, some friends find it surprising that he has taken up painting, even suggesting it might be just a casual hobby. I believe it is not merely a whim. From his youth, Liang Bin had a foundation in calligraphy and painting. After decades of revolutionary life and moving to the city, due to illness, he frequently visited antique book stalls, art shops, and galleries, developing a keen interest in collecting, appreciating, studying, and even copying artworks. Thus, his deep interest in calligraphy and painting, and his ability to produce so many works, is not accidental.

The tradition of being skilled in both calligraphy and painting is unique to Chinese literati, forming a distinct style of literati painting. Chinese literati painting is a crystallization of China's excellent cultural heritage and an important aspect of China's painting tradition, adding boundless vitality and luster to Chinese painting.

"Great forms are shapeless, great sounds are silent." Chinese literati, nourished by national culture, are moved by the landscapes and scenery of their motherland. With the unique emotional expression of the Chinese people, they spontaneously capture the essence of their feelings and convey them through their brushstrokes. This is more about emotion and inspiration rather than technique, thus creating the unique beauty of Chinese literati painting. This is fundamentally different from Western painting. Western figure painting can precisely depict the structure of the human body, meticulously portraying the texture, volume, light, and color of natural objects. Chinese painting, especially literati painting, captures the most striking characteristics of objects and expresses the deepest emotions. Liang Bin's paintings, including his calligraphy, are exactly this way.

Liang Bin's paintings are a new form of literati painting, revolutionary literati painting. His paintings, like his literary works, are full of passion and hope. Those who have seen his paintings all feel that they exude the fragrance of new-era books, with a profound and rustic artistic expression.

Chinese painting emphasizes lineage. Liang Bin's calligraphy started with Yi Bingshui, and his paintings of plum blossoms are inspired by Jin Dongxin. His calligraphy also draws inspiration from the *Zhang Qian Stele* and *Shimen Song*, while his paintings of flowers, landscapes, and fruits borrow techniques from Wen Zhengming, Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and Shitao. The subjects he depicts are mostly from his hometown and the landscapes of the Yangtze River region, gradually forming his unique style. His ink paintings of lotus and water bamboo are vivid, with light ink shading and fine lines crossing, drop by drop, poetically conveying the atmosphere of summer rain and mist. His paintings of grapes, gourds, mountain flowers, and leaves are lush and full of life, exuding a rustic charm. His plum blossoms are often depicted in full bloom, with old, twisted trunks and new branches extending horizontally; the trunks are drawn according to his own personality, but they are "aged in appearance," full of vitality. His painting *Extending Hand, Waving Three Bamboo Stems* features sturdy bamboo leaves, with dense and sparse arrangements, and appropriate ink density, completely different from previous styles, yet evokes a sense of gentle breeze.

Over the past twenty years, Liang Bin has continuously improved his skills in calligraphy and painting, developing his unique style and level. In Hebei's Lixian County during the Qing Dynasty, there were Li Mingxing and Li Yung (Li Gangzhu), with Li Gangzhu being a scholar who could also paint well. There were also calligraphers like Jiang Shifen and painters like Chen Jiajin. The hometown treasures these legends and has passed them down. Now, a literary giant like Liang Bin has achieved such success in Chinese painting, which is a source of pride for our hometown—even as his younger brother, I feel honored.

    梁斌的画
    黄胄 
    梁斌的文学著作，抒写了我国现代农民革命的历史风云，茅盾曾面对梁斌说：“是里程碑式的作品。”梁斌是现代著名的文学家，他的成就在五十年代已有定评，公认他是一代大家，培养了一代人。因此，有朋友对他提笔作画感到新奇，甚至说他不过是偶然的游戏之作而已。我说不是偶然的，他自少年时代，就有书画基础。革命生活数十年，进城以后，因病时常逛旧书摊、文物店、画店，热衷于收藏、鉴赏、研究以至临摹。所以，他对书画艺术兴趣这么大，能画出这么多作品，不是偶然的。
    能书善画是我国文人特有的传统，形成独树一帜的文人画。中国文人画是中国优秀文化遗产的结晶，也是中国绘画的优良传统的一个方面，给中国画增添了无穷生命力和光彩。
  “大象无形，大音稀声。”中国文人接受了民族文化的哺育，为祖国的山川风物所激动，又以中华民族所特有的感情表达方式，兴之所至，发之毫端，更多的不是技巧，而是感情和兴会，因此构成了中国文人画那种清越的美的意境。这基本上不同于西洋绘画。西洋的人体画能够那样精确地表现人体结构，它是从人体解剖原理出发，丝毫必现地描绘自然物的质感、量感、光感和色彩的。中国画特别是文人画，则是捕捉事物最感动自己的那种最主要特征，抒写胸中最激动的感情。梁斌的画，也包括字，正是如此。
    梁斌的画是新文人画，革命的文人画。他的画没有青藤、八大和扬州画派那种高古荒寒，那种因愤懑不平和怀才不遇所形成的指天骂地，牢骚满纸。梁斌的画和文学创作一样，充满激情和希望。看过他的画的人，都认为散发着新时代的书卷气，表现意象凝重厚朴。
    中国画讲究师承关系。梁斌写字从伊秉绶入手，画梅则心追金冬心；而字又汲取了《张迁碑》、《石门颂》的意致，画花卉、山水、蔬果又旁取青藤、八大、石涛的笔墨。他描绘的对象，多出自家乡及大江南北景物，并逐渐形成个人的风格。他画墨荷、芭水墨淋漓，加以淡墨渲染，细线斜穿，滴滴点点，富有诗意地显示出夏日阴霾雨雾的气氛。他画葡萄、葫芦、山花、枝叶丰满，果实累累，洋溢着乡土气息。他画梅，多做满枝，老干虬曲，新枝横斜；树干全凭自己个性而画，但“老在须眉”，充满健旺的生命力。他所画《伸手挥得三杆竹》，竹叶坚挺，疏密相间，浓淡得宜，全然不同于前人笔法，却能生清风徐来之感。
    二十多年来，梁斌在书画鉴赏和笔墨上不断提高，画出了自己的风格和水平。河北蠡县清初出过李明性、李塨（刚主）父子，刚主是理学家也能画一笔好画，还有书家蒋式芬、画家陈嘉楷，家乡珍重递藏并流传不少神奇的传说。现在，一代文学大家梁斌，在中国画上又达到如此成就，这是我们家乡的荣誉——作为他的弟兄，我也感到光荣。
