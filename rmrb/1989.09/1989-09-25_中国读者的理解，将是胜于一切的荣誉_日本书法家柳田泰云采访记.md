People's Daily reporter Zhou Qing

Yanagita Taikun, originally named Yanagita Ijū, with Taikun as his artistic name, was born on January 1, 1902, in Tokyo to a family of calligraphers. He has dedicated his life to the study of Chinese calligraphy and is currently the president of the Japanese Calligraphy Academy.

Reporter: I am here on behalf of the readers of the People's Daily to interview you. You have set up your studio in the southern foothills of the Eight Peaks, is this to pursue the ideal of "living in a secluded place but not hearing the noise of carriages and horses"?

Taikun: The air and environment here are good for my health. The studio is dry, which is suitable for preserving paper and calligraphy works. The famous Japanese spring, Kai Shouzen, is nearby, and using water from this spring to grind ink produces excellent results. During the construction of the studio, there were many stones, which were used to decorate the scenery, so I named the studio "Leilei Stone Cave." There are few visitors in the mountains, time is abundant, and it is easy to get rid of the shackles of fame and wealth to pursue a noble character.

Reporter: You are 88 years old this year, and you still stay at home and work diligently. I heard that you will go to China to hold a calligraphy exhibition on October 1st to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China?

Taikun: Yes, I will select about 100 of my works to take to China for a calligraphy exhibition. At the same time, I will also hold a calligraphy exhibition by representatives of the Japanese Calligraphy Academy. These two exhibitions will start on September 29th at the Beijing Art Museum, then go to Xi'an, Wuhan, Kunming, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Shenyang, and end on June 21, 1990. After the exhibition, some works will be brought back to Japan, and some will be permanently left in China, donated to local museums for collection. There are many middle and primary school students in China who love calligraphy, and I also want to do something to encourage them.

Reporter: Your wife, Mrs. Qinglan, said that your blood is Japanese, but the cultural traditions, ethics, and calligraphy art you inherited are all from ancient China. Could you please tell us when you started learning Chinese calligraphy?

Taikun: From a young age, I received an education in Chinese ancient culture rather than Japanese culture. My grandfather and father both knew Chinese poetry and were calligraphers. According to my father's wishes, I did not graduate from elementary school and started learning calligraphy at home. I started practicing brush writing at the age of five and began writing the Thousand Character Classic at the age of ten, writing the entire text once a day, only in regular script, until the age of 35, a total of 30 years of regular script. After that, I began to write seal script, clerical script, running script, and cursive script. I have written so many calligraphy works in my life that I can't remember the exact number, but I remember that after the age of 80, I wrote more than 2,000 pieces.

Reporter: As far as I know, you won the Minister of Education's Award at the age of 25 and became a rising star in the Japanese calligraphy world. The National Museum of Japan also collects your regular script work "Li Sao." The president of the Yomiuri Shimbun, Kobayashi Yoshimi, said that you are best at regular script, and your Chinese calligraphy art is the pinnacle of contemporary Japanese calligraphy. This is consistent with some of the evaluations I have heard from the Chinese calligraphy world. Could you please tell us what you think is the essence of Chinese calligraphy art? What is the most difficult part for Japanese people to learn Chinese calligraphy?

Taikun: Chinese calligraphy is the supreme art created by China. I have always admired the high and noble calligraphy works of the Jin and Tang dynasties in China and dream of being able to inherit this tradition and develop my own unique style. The essence of Chinese calligraphy lies in the spiritual realm of the work, which requires a high level of elegance, taste, and grandeur. In Chinese history, there have been people who have reached this realm, but in the Japanese calligraphy world, no one has reached this realm. Nowadays, almost no one in the Japanese calligraphy world studies high-taste regular script, which is something to reflect on.

Reporter: Your wife, Mrs. Qinglan, has tried to use television, lasers, and other new technologies to spread calligraphy art, creating "future calligraphy" with movement, color, and sound, which can be appreciated through the television screen. What is your evaluation of this?

Taikun: Her attempt has the advantage of being able to attract young people.

Reporter: Could you please introduce the situation of the Calligraphy Academy?

Taikun: The predecessor of the Calligraphy Academy was the Taikoku Calligraphy Society founded by my father, Yanagita Taikoku, in 1912. In 1958, it was changed to the Calligraphy Academy. The purpose of the academy is to establish and popularize pure calligraphy art. Students are from all over Japan, totaling about 300,000, including politicians, newspaper editors, and company managers. Currently, about 10,000 people are participating in the study, with the oldest being 80 years old and the youngest being primary school students. I have always hoped that there will be a genius among my students.

Reporter: What is your greatest wish in your later years?

Taikun: I only wish to have more time to leave more of my works for the world. I have pursued the highest realm of calligraphy art all my life, but I have not reached this realm. If I have another ten years of good health, I might be able to approach this realm, but I feel my strength is declining. China is the motherland of calligraphy art. For me, China is not only the mother of my thoughts, spirit, and art, but also the country that can truly evaluate my calligraphy art. In the lines and characters of my works, there is my longing for China, and I hope that Chinese readers can confirm this feeling. This will be the greatest honor for me.

    中国读者的理解，将是胜于一切的荣誉
    ——日本书法家柳田泰云采访记
    本报记者　周　庆
    柳田泰云，原名柳田伊秀，泰云是雅号。一九○二年一月一日生于东京一个书法世家，毕生致力于汉字书法的钻研，现为日本学书院院长。
    记者：我是代表人民日报的读者来访问先生的。您把创作室设在这八岳山南麓，是否为了追求“结庐在人境，而无车马喧”的意境？
    泰云：这里的空气、环境对我的健康有利。创作室干燥，宜于保存宣纸和书法作品。日本名泉甲斐小泉就在附近，用名泉之水研墨效果尤佳。创作室修建时，山石很多，都用来装点景致，所以我将创作室命名为“磊磊石窟”。山里客人稀少，时间充裕，易于摆脱浮名和利禄的羁绊，去追求高尚的字品。
    记者：先生今年八十八虚龄，近来仍足不出户，埋头创作，听说要在十月一日前去中国举办书法展览，以庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年？
    泰云：是的，我从自己的作品中精选出一百幅左右带到中国去举办书法作品展。同时，还举办日本学书院院人代表书法展。这两个展览从九月二十九日在北京美术馆开始，然后去西安、武汉、昆明、广州、上海、杭州、南京、沈阳展出，到一九九○年六月二十一日结束。展毕，一部分作品带回日本，一部分作品就永远留在中国，赠送给各地博物馆收藏。中国有许多中小学生喜爱书法，我也想为奖励他们做点事。
    记者：您的夫人青兰女士说，先生的血液是日本的，但继承的文化传统、伦理道德、书法艺术，都是古代中国的。请问您是何时开始学习汉字书法的？
    泰云：我从小接受的不是日本文化的教育，而是中国古代优秀文化传统的教育。祖父、父亲都懂汉诗，都是书法家。按照父亲的意愿，我小学没有毕业，就在家里学书法了。五岁开始练毛笔字，十岁开始写千字文，每天全文写一遍，只写楷书，到三十五岁，共写了三十年楷书。之后，才开始写篆、隶、行、草等字体。我这一生写了多少书法作品自己也记不清了，只记得八十岁以后写了二千多幅。
    记者：据我所知，您二十五岁时，即荣获文部大臣奖，成为日本书坛后起之秀。日本国立博物馆还收藏了您的楷书作品《离骚》。日本《读卖新闻》社长小林与三次说您最擅长楷书，您的汉字书法艺术是当代日本书法界的最高峰。这和我听到的中国书法界的一些评价相同。请问您所体会的汉字书法艺术的精髓是什么？日本人学习汉字书法最难的地方在哪里？
    泰云：汉字书法是中国创造的至高无尚的艺术。我一生最推崇中国晋唐时代高洁的书法作品，梦想能在继承这个传统的基础上发挥自己的独创精神。汉字书法的精髓在于作品的精神境界，它要求有很高的气品、格调和宏大的规模。中国历史上曾有人达到过这个境界，日本书法界则没人能达到这个境界。现在日本的书法家中，几乎无人研究高格调的楷书，此事值得反省。
    记者：您的夫人青兰女士尝试用电视、激光等新技术传播书法艺术，创造了“未来书法”，有动感、色彩、声音，可以通过电视屏幕来欣赏。对此您作何评价？
    泰云：她的尝试有一个好处，可以对青年人产生吸引力。
    记者：能否介绍一下学书院的情况？
    泰云：学书院的前身是一九一二年由家父柳田泰麓创办的泰麓书道会，一九五八年改为学书院，办院宗旨是确立和普及纯正的书法艺术，学员遍及全日本，前后约有三十万人，有政治家、报社社长、大公司经理等。目前参加学习的约有一万人，年纪最大的八十岁，最小的是小学生。我一直期待着我的学生中能出现天才性人物。
    记者：您晚年最大的愿望是什么？
    泰云：唯愿能有更多的时间，为这个世界多留下一些我的作品。我毕生追求的，是书法艺术的最高境界，但我没能达到这个境界。如果我还有十年健康的时间，我或许能接近这个境界，可我已感到自己的力量在衰退。中国是书法艺术的母国。对我来说，中国不仅是我的思想、精神、艺术之母，也是能真正评价我的书法艺术的国度。在我作品的字里行间，浸透着我对中国的思慕之情，希望中国的读者能确认我的这种感情。这对我来说，将是胜于一切的荣誉。
