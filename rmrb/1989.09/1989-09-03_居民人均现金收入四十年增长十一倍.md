Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 3rd.

    In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, the per capita cash income of urban residents in China has increased by more than elevenfold. After accounting for price increases, the average annual income of residents before 1978 increased by 1.7%, and from 1978 to 1988, the average annual increase was 7%.

    According to materials provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, in 1949, the per capita income of urban residents in China was less than 100 yuan. After the national liberation, the Party and the state made every effort to restore and develop production. By 1952, residents' per capita income had increased to 155.5 yuan, a 56.8% increase over 1949. However, after accounting for price factors, it had not yet reached the level of 1949. By 1978, residents' per capita income had reached 378.2 yuan, a 55.5% increase over 1952 after accounting for price factors.

    Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the rapid development of socialist commodity economy, urban employment channels have increased, the number of employed family members has increased, and the income structure of residents has undergone significant changes: first, the absolute amount of standard wages has increased; second, income from bonuses and allowances has increased; third, non-wage income has increased. Additionally, income from second jobs and re-employment of retirees has emerged. It is estimated that in 1988, residents' per capita income reached 1269 yuan, and after accounting for price factors, it was still double that of 1978.

    居民人均现金收入四十年增长十一倍
    新华社北京9月3日电　（记者傅刚）建国40年来，我国城镇居民的人均现金收入增长11倍以上，扣除物价上涨因素，1978年以前居民平均每年收入递增1.7％，1978年至1988年，平均每年递增7％。
    据国家统计局提供的材料，1949年我国城镇居民的人均收入不到100元。全国解放后，党和国家全力恢复、发展生产，到1952年，居民人均收入增加到155.5元，比1949年增长56.8％，扣除物价的因素，尚未达到1949年的水平。1978年，居民人均收入达378.2元，扣除物价的因素，比1952年增长55.5％。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，随着社会主义有计划商品经济的迅速发展，城镇就业渠道增多，家庭就业人数增多，居民的收入结构发生了很大变化：一是标准工资的绝对量增加，二是奖金、津贴的收入增加，三是非工资性收入增加。另外还出现了第二职业的收入，以及退休人员再就业的收入。据测算， 1988年居民人均收入达1269元，扣除物价的因素，仍比1978年提高1倍。
