People's Daily, United Nations, September 19th - Correspondent Li Kaichen reports: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar said today that the improvement in relations among state groups has eased international tensions, and the trend of cooperation among nations is strengthening. This atmosphere and trend have enabled the United Nations to achieve many successes in mediating regional conflicts recently.

De Cuéllar said at a press conference here today that he will continue to seek ways to resolve regional conflict issues.

De Cuéllar said that with the help of the United Nations, Namibia will gain independence this November. He hopes that when this session of the General Assembly reconvenes, Namibia will become the 160th member of the United Nations.

De Cuéllar said that Iran and Iraq have both agreed to his special representative for the Iran-Iraq issue, Elisson, visiting the region at the end of October.

On the Lebanese issue, De Cuéllar said that his responsibility is to assist Lebanon in establishing a genuine, comprehensive, and serious ceasefire.

On the Cambodian issue, he said that he is prepared to continue mediating and helping all parties find a solution to the Cambodian problem.

De Cuéllar finally said that while there are many international ideas on solving the debt problems of developing countries, there is little action, and some plans only involve a few countries. He pointed out that not only private banks but also some governments of developed countries have a responsibility to help solve the debt problems of developing countries.
