The second round of the Chinese Chess King Challenge Match has completed two rounds, with Li Laiqun securing two consecutive victories.

Reported by Chen Zhao from Beijing on September 3rd: The incumbent chess king, Hu Ronghua, faced two consecutive challenges from the 29-year-old contender, Li Laiqun, casting a shadow over his prospects for retaining the title.

The second Chinese Chess King Challenge Match opened on September 1st in Beijing. Prior to this, Li Laiqun secured the right to challenge by winning four matches, drawing one, and losing one in the first stage of the competition.

In the first match held on September 2nd, Li Laiqun seized the initiative, positioning his red cannon at the forefront and adopting an offensive stance. Hu Ronghua responded with a standard cannon strategy. Li Laiqun executed a series of brilliant moves in the mid-game, using his cannon to capture Hu's elephant, thereby gaining the upper hand. After exchanging pieces, Li Laiqun had three more soldiers than Hu Ronghua, giving him a clear advantage. He then captured Hu's general, securing the victory.

In today's second match, Hu Ronghua, playing red and moving first, set up a flying elephant formation, aiming for a prolonged battle. Li Laiqun responded with an unusual horse formation. As the mid-game progressed, both sides became locked in a stalemate. Spectators and experts believed that a draw was inevitable. However, Hu Ronghua, eager for victory and unwilling to settle for a draw, advanced his chariot and horse. In his haste to capture an elephant, he was countered by Li Laiqun, who captured his chariot. Hu Ronghua had no choice but to abandon his chariot to capture a cannon, leading to a reversal of the situation. Li Laiqun won the second match as well.

This Chess King Challenge Match will consist of six rounds. Hu Ronghua has lost the first two rounds, putting him in a precarious position.

    棋王挑战赛已下两盘
    李来群抢先得势告捷
    本报北京9月3日讯　记者陈昭报道：力图卫冕棋王宝座的胡荣华遇到了29岁的挑战者李来群的两度冲击，这使他蝉联冠军的前景顿显黯淡。
    第二届中国象棋棋王挑战赛是9月1日在北京开幕的。在此之前，李来群在第一阶段的比赛中，以4胜1和1负的成绩取得了本届棋王赛的挑战权。
    李来群在9月2日进行的首场比赛中，抢得先手，红炮当头，摆出一番进攻架式。胡荣华则以顺手炮应战。李来群在中盘连施妙手，用炮打掉了对方的象而取得先手。经过兑子之后，李来群比胡荣华多3个兵，在实力上完全占了优势，从而一举擒将。
    在今天的第二盘比赛中，执红先行的胡荣华布下了飞象局，准备打持久战，而李来群则应以不大常见的骑马局。进入中盘之后，双方成胶着状态，在旁观战的行家认为，照此下去，和棋无疑。未料此时胡荣华求胜心切，不甘和棋结果，挺车拍马。由于贪吃一象，被李来群捉住一车，胡无奈只好弃车吃炮，以后形势逆转，李来群又胜一盘。
    本届棋王赛将进行六盘比赛，胡荣华连失两盘，形势严峻。
