	Autumn Forest Fire Prevention Period Approaching
	Dian Jiyun Urges No Complacency and No Relaxation in Work

	BEIJING, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) — As various regions are about to enter the autumn forest fire prevention period, Vice Premier and Commander-in-Chief of the State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters Dian Jiyun presided over a meeting of the State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters today. He stressed that all levels of leadership must pay high attention to autumn forest fire prevention work, make early arrangements, and implement fire prevention and extinguishing measures. He urged everyone to continue their efforts and thoroughly do a good job in autumn and winter prevention work, aiming to achieve a significant reduction in the number of forest fires and the area affected by fires compared to last year.

	Reporters learned from the meeting that this year's national spring forest fire prevention work has overcome unfavorable natural conditions and achieved the best results since the founding of the People's Republic of China in the same period. Compared with the best forest fire prevention period in 1988, several key indicators have seen significant reductions, including a 56.2% decrease in the number of forest fires and a 28.1% reduction in the area affected by fires.

	It was reported that starting from September 15, various regions in China will successively enter the autumn forest fire prevention period. Dian Jiyun emphasized that in forest fire prevention work, there must be no complacency or relaxation. He called for a heightened awareness of the importance of forest fire prevention and for treating it as a major task. Leaders at all levels must personally oversee the work, implement a system where department and regional heads are held responsible, and link forest protection and fire prevention with the performance evaluation of cadres.

	He also stressed the need to establish a strict responsibility system, ensuring that responsibilities are clearly assigned at all levels.
