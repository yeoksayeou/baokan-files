The severe case of Hainan Province Governor Liang Xiang using power for personal gain has led to the decision by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to remove him from all his Party and government positions. This action clearly demonstrates the Party and government's resolve to combat corruption. It also shows that in our country, regardless of whether one is a general cadre or a high-level cadre, anyone who violates Party discipline, administrative regulations, or national laws will be severely punished. This applies to Liang Xiang, and it will apply to other cadres, including high-level cadres.

Liang Xiang's mistakes are representative of a broader issue. He abused the power entrusted to him by the Party and the people, not only directly violating financial discipline and using his power for personal gain, but also supporting and enabling his wife and son to use his influence to seek personal benefits and amass wealth. This is a typical case of using power for personal gain. All comrades should learn from Liang Xiang's mistakes.

Liang Xiang's errors also remind us that in the new historical conditions, all levels of leading cadres must withstand the tests of reform and opening up and of being in power, and not be swayed by money or personal interests. Liang Xiang's mistakes have harmed the image of reform and opening up. His punishment is to better implement the policies of reform and opening up. One of the key reasons Liang Xiang committed such serious errors of using power for personal gain and violating financial discipline is that he forgot the fundamental principle of serving the people wholeheartedly. In the new situation of reform and opening up, he relaxed his vigilance and was unable to resist the corrupting influence of the idea of chasing after money. All comrades should take this as a warning.

　　以权谋私者戒
　　新华社特约评论员
    海南省省长梁湘严重以权谋私，党中央、国务院决定撤销其党内外一切职务。这件事无可置疑地表明了我们党和政府惩治腐败的决心。这件事还表明，在我国无论什么人，不管是一般干部还是高级干部，只要违反党纪、政纪、国法，都必将受到严肃处理，对于梁湘是这样，对其他干部包括高级干部，也必然是这样。
    梁湘同志的错误具有一定的代表性。他凭借党和人民赋予的权力，不但本人直接违反财经纪律，以权谋私，而且支持和纵容妻子儿子利用本人的权势，以谋私利，捞取金钱。这是以权谋私的一个典型事例。所有同志都应从梁湘以权谋私错误的事例中吸取应有的教训。
    梁湘同志的错误还告诉我们，在新的历史条件下，各级领导干部一定要经得起改革开放和执政的考验，不为金钱和私利所动。梁湘的错误，损害了改革开放的形象，给梁湘处分，是为了更好地执行改革开放的政策。梁湘之所以犯了以权谋私及违反财经纪律的严重错误，其中一个很重要的原因，就是忘记了全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨，在改革开放的新形势下放松了警惕，没有能够抵御住一切向钱看的腐朽思想的侵袭。对此，我们所有的同志都应引以为戒。
