Sunday markets in Peru, such as those in Pisac, Chinchero, Huacayo, and Cajamarca, have long been bustling with activity. The scenes at these markets are vibrant, with colorful clothing, abundant local specialties, and unique handcrafted items creating a mythical kaleidoscope. Even after wandering among the stalls for hours, you can't see everything on display. Potatoes are stored in sacks, with varieties that are unmatched elsewhere, as Peru is the birthplace of the potato. There are also mountain corn, chilies, peas, various seeds, fruits, dried fish, vegetables… Indigenous men carry sacks filled with chickens on their backs, hawking their wares; indigenous women lead llamas, moving through the crowds in the square; some women dressed in bright colors carry baskets filled with dolphins from the Atlantic, bargaining with the locals. In homemade multi-tiered cages, rare local birds are kept, often surrounded by enthusiastic tourists. The market is bustling all day long.

For a long time, transactions here have mostly been barter exchanges. As long as both parties agree, they don't worry about whether the value of the goods is equal; a sack of rice for two sacks of potatoes, a large fish for two bunches of chilies, an intricately carved leather belt for a pair of chicks, a talking parrot for a piece of silver jewelry. It is understood that price fluctuations often depend on the year's harvest or weather conditions, or even the popularity of a particular item at the time.

Generally, transactions here are quite simple. The buyer and seller discuss the price for a while, then smile knowingly, and the deal is done.

Of course, using money to buy things here is also very convenient. Local currency and dollars are both accepted, and settling in dollars is common here because many foreigners come to the market. Among the handicrafts, miniature llama sculptures and dolls dressed in typical Peruvian regional costumes are particularly popular with foreigners.

　　秘鲁的星期天集市
    星期天集市，在秘鲁的皮萨克、琴切洛、瓦卡约、卡哈马尔卡等地，一直办得相当红火。集市所呈现的景象，彩色鲜艳的服装、丰富的土特产和别具匠心的手工艺品，组成神话般的万花筒。你沿着货摊转悠几个小时，也看不尽这些琳琅满目的商品。土豆成麻袋地存放在那里，品种之多是别的国家没法比的，因为这里是土豆的故乡。还有山地玉米、辣椒、豌豆，各种各样的种子、水果、鱼干、青菜……印第安男人肩背装满母鸡的背袋在叫卖；印第安妇女牵着羊驼，出没在广场的人流中；一些穿着花花绿绿的妇女，挎着满载着大西洋鼠海豚的篮子，在跟山民讨价还价。在自制的多层笼子里关着的是当地稀有的珍禽，在它的周围常常围满了兴致勃勃的旅游人群。集市的一整天都是这样熙熙攘攘。
    很久以来，这里的交易大多是以物易物。只要两相情愿，他们并不计较商品本身价值是否对等；一口袋大米换两口袋土豆，一条大鱼换两把辣椒，一条刻花皮腰带换一对小雏鸡，一只会说话的鹦鹉换一副银饰物。据了解，价格的浮动往往取决于当年的粮食收成或气候条件，甚至于某种商品当时的时髦程度。
    总的来说，这里的买卖成交相当简单。买卖双方先讲一阵子价钱，然后会意地笑笑，这笔买卖就算做成了。
    当然，用钱在这里买东西也是很方便的。当地货和美元可以通用，以美元结算在这里已习以为常，因为来赶集的外国人相当多。在手工艺品中，微型羊驼雕像和穿着秘鲁各地典型风格服装的小洋娃娃最受外国人青睐。
