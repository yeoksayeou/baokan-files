At the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Gorbachev visited China from May 15 to 18, 1989. Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Chairman Gorbachev held a summit meeting in Beijing on May 16. The high-level meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union marked the normalization of state relations between the two countries, and the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also returned to normal. This not only conforms to the interests and wishes of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union but also is conducive to the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region and to world peace and security.

Since the 1960s, relations between China and the Soviet Union have been in an abnormal state for a long time. Since 1982, Sino-Soviet relations have gradually improved. From 1984 to 1986, vice-premiers of the two governments, as well as representatives of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, conducted multiple contacts, visits, or mutual visits. In 1987, the Sino-Soviet border negotiations, which had been suspended for nine years, resumed. In December 1988 and February 1989, the foreign ministers of the two countries made reciprocal visits, making substantial progress in removing the three major obstacles and also making specific preparations for the Sino-Soviet high-level meeting. China and the Soviet Union will "end the past and open the future," developing a new type of state-to-state relationship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two parties will conduct contacts and exchanges based on the principles of independence, autonomy, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. This has great significance for promoting the healthy development of Sino-Soviet relations and the two parties in the future.

    同苏联实现关系正常化
    应杨尚昆主席的邀请，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫于一九八九年五月十五日至十八日对中国进行了正式访问。邓小平主席与戈尔巴乔夫主席五月十六日在北京举行最高级会晤。中苏两国领导人的高级会晤，标志着中苏两国实现国家关系正常化，中国共产党与苏联共产党的关系也随之正常化。这不仅符合中苏两国人民的利益和愿望，而且有利于亚太地区的稳定和发展，有利于世界的和平与安全。
    从六十年代开始，中苏两国关系长期处于不正常状态。一九八二年以来，中苏关系逐渐改善。一九八四年至一九八六年，两国政府副总理以及中国人大常委会和苏联最高苏维埃主席团代表团先后进行多次接触、访问或互访。一九八七年，中断九年之久的中苏边界谈判恢复。一九八八年十二月和一九八九年二月，中苏两国外长互访，在消除三大障碍方面取得了实质性进展，同时为中苏高级会晤作了具体准备。中苏两国“结束过去，开辟未来”，将在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展新型的国家关系，中苏两党将根据独立自主、完全平等、相互尊重、互不干涉内部事务的原则进行接触和交往。这对推动今后中苏两国和两党关系的健康发展具有重大意义。
