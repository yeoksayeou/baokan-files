The foreign ministers' conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in preparation for the Ninth Summit, opened this morning at the Sava Center here. Over the course of the two-day meeting, the foreign ministers will first hear recommendations from the senior officials' meeting regarding the work and agenda of this conference, and discuss organizational matters for the summit.

At yesterday's senior officials' meeting, after intense discussions, Panama withdrew its reservation regarding the admission of Venezuela as a formal member of the Non-Aligned Movement, thereby achieving a consensus. Originally, Panama accused Venezuela of interfering in its internal affairs and opposed Venezuela's admission as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. The meeting also discussed the issue of the proportion of guests at the Ninth Summit, as 11 out of the 20 guest countries are members of the two major military blocs, which has never happened before. Senior officials decided that the Non-Aligned Movement's Coordination Bureau in New York will propose a review of the standards for future guest admissions. The meeting reached a consensus on the election of leaders for various summit institutions.

The Ninth Summit began today in Belgrade. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Lončar spoke to reporters about the goals of this conference, stating that the Non-Aligned Movement should shift from issuing political and moral appeals to taking concrete political actions. He said that affirming the modern concept and direction of the Non-Aligned Movement will be the greatest achievement of the Belgrade Summit, as this means the Non-Aligned Movement is taking a practical and action-oriented path.

Lončar said that the Non-Aligned Movement should formulate a reform agenda in the following three areas:

First, make the Non-Aligned Movement an attractive and expected factor in the process of easing urgent situations, disarmament, and finding new solutions for international stability, that is, a truly indispensable factor in resolving crisis hotspots. Second, concretize the view of seeking balanced (equal) interests in South-North relations, which should be actionable, reasonable, and selective. Third, the Non-Aligned Movement should work to eliminate new disasters of modern civilization—ecological threats, drug trafficking, and terrorism.

    不结盟国家外长会议开幕
    南外长阐述本次首脑会议目标
    本报贝尔格莱德9月1日电　记者严正报道：为第九次首脑会议作准备的不结盟国家外长会议今天上午在这里的萨瓦中心开幕。在这为期两天的会议中，外长们将首先听取高级官员会议对这次会议的工作及其日程等提出的建议，讨论首脑会议的各项组织工作。
    在昨天的高级官员会议上，经过紧张的讨论后巴拿马撤销了对接纳委内瑞拉为不结盟运动正式成员国的保留态度，从而取得了一致意见。原来巴拿马指责委内瑞拉干涉它的内政，反对接纳委内瑞拉为不结盟运动成员国。会议还讨论了第九次首脑会议来宾比例的问题，因为在20个来宾国中有11个是两大军事集团的成员，这是过去从来没有的。高级官员们作出决定，以后纽约不结盟运动协调局举行会议时，将提出重新审议今后接纳来宾标准的问题。会议就首脑会议各机构领导人员的选举问题取得了一致意见。
    本报贝尔格莱德8月31日电　记者严正报道，今天在贝尔格莱德首脑会议拉开序幕之际，南斯拉夫外长隆查尔向记者阐述了本次会议的目标，指出不结盟运动应从发出政治道义的呼声转向采取实际的政治行动。他说，肯定不结盟运动现代化的概念及其行动方向，这将是贝尔格莱德首脑会议最大的成就，因为这意味着不结盟运动走上现实的和采取实际行动的具体道路。
    隆查尔说，不结盟运动应在下述三个方面制定革新的纲领：
    第一，使不结盟运动在缓和紧急局势、裁军以及为国际稳定寻找新的解决办法的进程中成为有吸引力的为人们所期望的因素，即在解决危机热点的过程中真正不可缺少的因素；第二使自己对寻求南北关系中均衡（平等）利益的观点具体化，这种观点应是有利于行动的、合理的，并且是有选择的；第三，不结盟运动要致力于消除现代文明的新灾祸——生态威胁、贩毒和恐怖主义。
