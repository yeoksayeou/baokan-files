“From my childhood, I grew up in China and have developed a deep affection for this land and its people. I have been proud of China's revolutionary success and the development of its construction. Today, on the 40th anniversary of New China, I am happy and also full of hope.” The honorary president of the China Construction Magazine, Epstein, who has experienced both old and new China, with his blue eyes sparkling, shared his deepest feelings with the reporter who came to his residence for an interview.

“My heart was trembling with excitement”

Epstein, now 74 years old, came to China with his Polish parents as a child and was unexpectedly swept into the whirlpool of Chinese life. In the 1930s, he met the friend of the Chinese people, Edgar Snow. In 1938, he participated in the work of the headquarters of the China Defense League, directly led by Song Qingling. Furthermore, in 1944, he accompanied a group of Chinese and foreign journalists to visit Yan'an and the Jin-Sui Anti-Japanese Base. No one expected that after four months of reporting, the indomitable national spirit of the Chinese people left an indelible impression on him. He said, “The trip to Yan'an had a decisive influence on me. I saw China's future and felt that a new China would definitely be born under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.”

However, on the day New China was established, he was not in China but in the United States. Epstein recalled, “After participating in the celebration activities with my wife among American progressives, we held a private celebration. When we walked to the corner of Times Square and stopped in front of a recording shop, I stopped in my tracks. In the recording room, I sang the Chinese national anthem, 'March of the Volunteers,' to my wife. Although my voice was not good, my heart was trembling with excitement.” He still treasures this recording to this day.

“Everything in my eyes has changed in China!” When Epstein and his wife, Qiu Moli, stepped onto Chinese soil in 1951 after a seven-year absence, they were astonished. The emaciated starving people, beggars everywhere, and idle vagrants had disappeared; the arrogant foreign colonialists and their lackeys had vanished; and the social evils of drug addiction and prostitution had been swept away. Before their eyes, everyone had a job, everyone had food to eat, and people addressed each other as “comrades,” united in heart for a noble goal. The people generally had a sense of pride in being masters of their own country.

“China's progress is recognized worldwide!”

Epstein took a unique path, from internationalism to patriotism. After becoming a Chinese citizen in 1957, China seemed even more endearing in his blue eyes. His residence is filled with many photographs, yellowed black-and-white photos and recently collected color photos displayed together. They are like pages from different eras, and every detail can evoke Epstein's love for New China.

“China's progress is recognized worldwide!” Epstein spoke about China's development with special emotions. He said, “Before liberation, the steel pen tips and pins I used were all imported. After liberation, when China made the first jeep by hand, the whole country was proud. In the old China, I never saw tractors and other agricultural machinery, but now China not only produces millions of tractors of various models but also produces tens of thousands of trucks and cars of all sizes. A few years ago, foreigners brought in color TVs and tape recorders, and everyone came to see them, thinking foreigners were so clever. But now we produce them in large quantities. A few years ago, when I sat on a Chinese-made plane and saw the launch of rockets on TV, I was as happy as everyone else. As far as I know, now, China's production of many agricultural and industrial products has jumped to the forefront of the world. Steel ranks 4th, crude oil 5th, electricity generation 4th, coal, cement, cloth, grain, cotton, peanuts, etc., all rank first in the world. China has almost become the world's largest producer of bicycles, electric fans, and washing machines. These facts show that China has the ability to achieve its grand goal of modernization.”

Epstein's footsteps have traversed the length and breadth of China. The vibrant cities and countryside, and the magnificent rocket launch sites, have all left him with unforgettable memories. He has visited Tibet four times for on-the-spot reporting, each time for three to four months. He gestured, saying that just the notebooks alone were over a meter high, meticulously recording the earth-shaking changes on this land after the abolition of the serf system.

He took out a few of his English-language books for me to see, including one titled “The Transformation of Tibet,” which was thick and contained chapters on the before and after of Tibet, religion and serfdom, agriculture, industry, new cadres, the PLA in Tibet, and the united front. Epstein truly introduced this “mysterious” roof of the world, its yesterday, today, and tomorrow, to readers from various countries. He summed it up, saying, “The changes on this land are a concrete manifestation of the correct policies of the Communist Party of China and have important historical significance.”

After becoming a member and standing committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1983, Epstein's perspective on observing China became even broader, and he had the opportunity to discuss national affairs with China's leaders.

The reporter asked, “How do you view China in the past decade?”

“The 1980s were a decade of reform and opening up in China, an extraordinary chapter in the history of New China.” Epstein said, “Today, the goal of doubling the national income has been exceeded. The economic growth of China in these 10 years has surpassed the total of the 30 years after the founding of the nation. By the year 2000, even if the economic speed slows down somewhat, the national income can still be doubled. By the mid-21st century, that is, the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the entire country will reach the level of a moderately developed country. I believe that China, which has 1/4 of the world's population, achieving modernization itself, is a contribution to humanity.”

When it comes to the “China Construction” magazine, to which he has devoted half his life, he said, “China Construction” will also advance with the times. Starting next year, it will be renamed “Today's China,” and he will continue to serve it.

“I often make three comparisons”

China has done a lot and achieved results worthy of pride, but we still have a lot to do. Epstein said, “In the face of the rapidly developing technology of today's world, how to narrow the gap with advanced world standards is a pressing issue for China. We should never forget that we are a developing country, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go.”

Epstein has a broad experience and unique insights into things. He believes that some of the problems China is facing now are problems of progress and development. For example, industrial development has led to a reduction in arable land, an increase in urban residents, and problems such as housing and transportation difficulties; after opening up to the outside world, a large amount of technology, information, and capital have been introduced into China, but it has also led to a rise in the blind worship of Western capitalism; neglecting ideological education has led to the re-emergence of some corrupt practices in society. He said, “When we see achievements, we should not overlook the difficulties caused by mistakes; when we see difficulties, we should not be discouraged.”

Epstein has experienced both old and new China, and he has deep feelings about many issues. He said, “I often make three comparisons: the past China and the present China; what we have done and what we have not done; what we have achieved and what we should achieve. Such a comparison gives us a clear understanding of our country and full confidence in our future.”

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, he suggested to the reporter that the truth with historical significance should be widely publicized. This truth is that without the leadership of the Communist Party and without socialism, China's problems cannot be solved, and China cannot become prosperous and strong.

    蓝眼睛里的中国——访爱泼斯坦
    本报记者　陆振华
      “我从小在中国长大，和这块土地、这里的人民建立了深厚的感情。我曾为中国革命成功和建设事业发展而骄傲。今天，在新中国四十岁的时候，我高兴，同时寄予希望。”中国建设杂志社名誉社长、经历了新旧中国的爱泼斯坦，闪动着蓝色的眼睛，向前来他的寓所采访的记者叙述着他最深切的感受。
          “我激动得颤抖不已”
    今年74岁的爱泼斯坦，孩提时随波兰籍的父母飘零到中国后，没想到现实把他推入中华民族生活的旋涡。三十年代他结识了中国人民的朋友斯诺。1938年，他参加了宋庆龄直接领导的保卫中国同盟总部工作。不仅如此，1944年，他随中外记者团访问了延安和晋绥抗日根据地。谁也没有料到，经历这4个月的采访，中国人民不可征服的民族精神给他留下了永不磨灭的印象。他说：“延安之行给我决定性的影响，我看到了中国的未来，预感到新中国一定会在中国共产党的领导下诞生。”
    可是，新中国成立的那一天，他不在中国，而在美国。爱泼斯坦回忆说：“我同妻子兴奋地参加了美国进步人士庆祝活动后，又单独举行庆祝。当我们走到纽约时报广场拐角处一家录音店前，我停住脚步，在录音室里给妻子唱起了中国国歌《义勇军进行曲》。虽说我的嗓音不太好，但我的心却激动得颤抖不已。”这张录音唱片至今他还珍藏着呢。
      “我眼里的中国一切都变了！”当爱泼斯坦与妻子邱茉莉于1951年踏上离别7年之久的中国时，他们不禁大吃一惊，骨瘦如柴的饥民、无处不有的乞丐、无业游民不见了；横行霸道的外国殖民主义者以及他们的走狗也不知去向；吸毒、娼妓等社会丑恶现象也一扫而光。眼前是人人有工作，人人有饭吃，人们以“同志”相称，为了一个崇高的目标团结一心。人民群众普遍具有当家作主的自豪感。
        举世公认的进步
    爱泼斯坦走的是一条奇特的路，即由国际主义走到爱国主义。1957年他加入中国籍后，在他的蓝眼睛里中国似乎变得更加可亲了。他的寓所里有许多照片，发黄的黑白照片和新近搜集的彩色照片陈列在一起。它们像一幅幅不同时代的画页，每一细节都能勾起爱泼斯坦对新中国的爱。
      “中国的进步是举世公认的！”爱泼斯坦说起中国的发展，带有特殊的感情。他说：“解放前，我所使用的钢笔尖、大头针等都靠进口。解放后，当中国靠手工造出第一辆吉普车时，全国上下为之骄傲。在旧中国我从没见到有拖拉机等农业机械，现在中国不仅能生产数百万台各种型号的拖拉机，还能生产数十万辆卡车和大小轿车。前几年，外国人带来彩电、录音机，人家都来看，觉得外国人多高明，可现在我们也都大批生产了。前些年，当我坐上中国造的飞机和从电视里看到发射火箭时，我同其他人一样欢乐。据我所知，现在，中国许多工农产品产量已跃居到世界前列，钢名列第4位，原油第5位，发电量第4位，煤、水泥、布、粮食、棉花、花生等都名列世界首位。中国也几乎成为世界上最大的自行车、电风扇、洗衣机生产国。这些事实说明，中国完全有能力实现自己宏伟的现代化目标。”
    爱泼斯坦的足迹遍及中国南北，生机勃勃的城乡和壮观的火箭发射场，都曾给他留下难忘的记忆。他曾先后4次进入西藏实地采访，每次三四个月。他比划着说，光笔记本就有一米多高，详细记录了这块土地在推翻农奴制后震撼人心的变革。
    他拿出几本他的英文版著作给我看，其中一本是《西藏的转变》，厚厚的，内容有西藏的前后对比，宗教和农奴制，农业、工业、新干部，解放军在西藏，统一战线等章节。爱泼斯坦真实地把这个
  “神秘”的世界屋脊的昨天、今天和未来介绍给各国读者。他画龙点睛地说：“这块土地上发生的变革，是中国共产党正确政策的具体体现，具有重要的历史意义。”
    爱泼斯坦在1983年成为全国政协委员、常委后，他观察中国的视野更加广阔，并有机会和中国的领导人一起议论国事。
    记者问：“你如何看近10年来的中国？”
    “八十年代是中国改革开放的10年，是新中国历史上不平凡的一页。”爱泼斯坦说：“今天，国民生产总值翻一番的目标已超额完成。这10年的中国经济增长，超过了建国后30年的总和。到公元2000年时，即便经济速度放慢一些，国民生产总值还是可以再翻一番。到下个世纪五十年代，就是说新中国诞生100周年时，整个中国将达到中等发达国家水平。我以为拥有世界人口1／4的中国，实现现代化的本身，就是对人类的一个贡献。”
    提起爱泼斯坦为之贡献大半生心血的《中国建设》杂志，他说，《中国建设》也要和时代一起前进，明年开始将改名为《今日中国》，他将继续为之效力。
      “我经常进行三个对比”
    中国已做了许多事，取得了值得骄傲的成绩，但我们还有许多事情要做。爱泼斯坦说：“面对技术迅猛发展的当今世界，如何缩短和世界先进水平的差距，这是中国面临的一个紧迫的问题。我们应该时刻不忘自己是个发展中的国家，任重道远。”
    爱泼斯坦阅历深广，对事物颇有独到之见。他认为，中国现在出现的问题，有的是前进中、发展中的。例如，工业发展了，又导致了耕地减少，城市居民增加，出现了住房难、乘车难等问题；对外开放后把大量的技术、信息和资金引进中国，但确也使盲目崇拜西方资本主义的思想有所抬头；思想教育忽视了，社会上重新出现了一些腐败现象。他说：“我们看到成绩时，也不能忽视因失误造成的困难；看到困难时，也不能灰心丧气。”
    爱泼斯坦经历了新旧两种不同的中国，对许多问题感触很深。他说：“我经常进行三个对比：过去的中国和现在的中国；我们已做的事和未做的事；我们已取得的成就和应该取得的成就。这样一比较，对我们国家就有了清醒的认识，对我们的前途也就能满怀信心。”
    值此建国四十周年之际，他向记者建议，具有历史意义的真理应该多加宣传。这个真理就是，没有共产党领导，没有社会主义，中国的问题不可能得到解决，中国也不可能富强。
