    **The Life of Comrade Lin Tie**

    An outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal and steadfast communist warrior tested by time, a revolutionary and party affairs activist of the proletariat, the late Lin Tie, former first secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and third secretary of the North China Bureau, passed away in Beijing on September 17, 1989, at the age of 85 due to illness.

    Throughout his more than 60-year revolutionary career, Comrade Lin Tie fought bravely, worked diligently, and remained steadfastly loyal to the Party and the people, dedicating his entire life to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    Comrade Lin Tie was born in November 1904 in a rural intellectual family in Wanzhou, Sichuan Province. From a young age, he was diligent in his studies, achieving excellent results, and harbored deep hatred for imperialist invaders and warlord rulers. While studying at Wanzhou Middle School, he participated in student protests against Japanese ships entering the Wanzhou dock. In 1922, he transferred to Chongqing United Middle School, where he was influenced by early party leaders such as Xiao Chunu and Yun Daiying, embracing revolutionary ideas and actively participating in anti-imperialist patriotic student movements. After graduating from high school in the fall of 1925, he successively studied at China University, Sino-Russian University, and Law and Politics University in Beijing, reading many Marxist-Leninist works and actively participating in the anti-imperialist and anti-government struggles led by Comrade Li Dazhao. In November 1926, he joined the Communist Party of China at Law and Politics University. After joining the party, he served as the organizational committee member and acting secretary of the party branch, embarking on the path of a professional revolutionary. In the extremely treacherous environment, he actively engaged in revolutionary activities.

    After the failure of the Great Revolution, Comrade Lin Tie remained steadfast in his communist beliefs and continued the struggle. In the spring of 1928, at the party's arrangement, he went to the University of Paris to study statistics, using his student status as a cover to secretly engage in revolutionary work among Chinese students and workers in France. He successively served as a member, director of the training department, and secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's French Committee. He organized a strike by Chinese workers at a machinery factory in Paris. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, he led Chinese workers and students to demonstrate in front of the Japanese embassy in France, supporting the anti-imperialist struggle at home. That winter, during the preparatory meeting for the French National Red Trade Union Congress, he was expelled from France. He then traveled to Belgium, where he worked among Chinese sailors and was again expelled. In January 1932, at the decision of the Communist Party of China's representative office to the Comintern, he was sent to the Lenin School in Moscow. Shortly after arriving, he was sent to the Garik Chemical Plant in the Ural region for labor due to his opposition to Wang Ming's so-called "anti-rightist" struggle. In the fall of 1933, he entered the Eastern University in Moscow, where he served as the branch secretary of the Chinese department. From the winter of 1934 onwards, he successively studied in military and political special training classes, receiving rigorous party organizational life training and strict military training, learning the theories of armed struggle and party building. In the winter of 1935, he returned to China and was dispatched by the North China Bureau of the Communist Party to the 53rd Army of the Nationalist Party's Northeast Army to serve as the secretary of the party committee, earnestly implementing the central government's policy of an anti-Japanese national united front, and doing a great deal of work to win over the officers and soldiers. During the Land Revolution War, Comrade Lin Tie worked and studied abroad for a long time, enduring hardships and unyieldingly continuing the struggle, demonstrating the unyielding revolutionary spirit of a communist.

    After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he remained in the Beijing-Tianjin area to continue his work. In the fall of 1937, he participated in the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, serving as a committee member and responsible for the provincial military commission's work. In the spring of 1938, he was transferred to the Deng-Rong Brigade to serve as the political director, participating in the leadership of the opening up of the Pingxi base area. In June 1938, he was transferred to the North China Bureau to work. He successively served as a committee member, director of the mass movement department, director of the organization department, and acting director of the North China Bureau's organization department, as well as the principal of the North China Bureau's party school. During this period, he trained a large number of cadres, devoting a great deal of effort to the party's construction in the base area. He actively organized the masses to join the army and fight, conducting guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear. During the Japanese "mopping-up" operations, he led the fight against the enemy, foiling numerous encirclements by the Japanese and puppet forces, playing an important role in building and consolidating the North China base area. In the fall of 1944, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to restore the Jizhong Area Party Committee, and Comrade Lin Tie was transferred to serve as the committee secretary and political commissar of the military region. He mobilized the masses, leading the people of Jizhong to strengthen the party's organizational construction, political power construction, and military construction in the base area. He followed the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong to "weaken the enemy, develop our army, reduce the enemy-occupied area, and expand the liberated area," carefully organizing the spring and summer offensives of 1945, heavily striking the Japanese and puppet forces, liberating more than a dozen counties, and making outstanding contributions to the final victory of the anti-Japanese war in the Jizhong Plain.

    During the War of Liberation, Comrade Lin Tie continued to serve as the secretary of the Jizhong Area Party Committee and political commissar of the military region, leading the people of Jizhong to fight against the Nationalist reactionaries, making the Jizhong liberated area more consolidated, achieving significant results in eliminating traitors, land reform, and developing production, and mobilizing the maximum amount of manpower and resources to support the frontline. During the Pingjin Campaign, he organized hundreds of thousands of militia and workers to support the People's Liberation Army, making great contributions to the victory of the War of Liberation and the establishment of New China.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Lin Tie successively served as the first secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and first political commissar of the military region, governor, chairman of the provincial political consultative conference, chairman of the North China Cooperation Committee, member of the North China Bureau, third secretary of the North China Bureau, and important leadership positions such as a member of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party. He adhered to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combining the actual situation of the entire province, earnestly implementing the party's line, principles, and policies. He focused on the party's ideological and organizational construction, mobilizing the enthusiasm of a large number of party members, cadres, and the masses. With deep affection for the people of Hebei, he worked together with the leaders of several base areas to lead the people of the entire province to quickly restore the economy and heal the wounds of war; took effective measures to overcome the three years of difficulty; to combat natural disasters, vigorously treated the Haihe River, and built dozens of large and medium-sized reservoirs; to change the backward face of industrial and agricultural production, built several steel and textile bases. During his 17 years of work in the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the province's economy not only quickly recovered but also continued to develop. Education, science, culture, and other undertakings also made great progress. Comrade Lin Tie devoted his heart and soul to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Hebei Province, achieving remarkable results.

    During the ten years of turmoil, Comrade Lin Tie was brutally persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing anti-party cliques, being falsely accused of numerous crimes, and his body was severely damaged. Under high pressure, he never surrendered, daring to uphold the truth and fight to the end.

    After the smashing of the "Gang of Four," Comrade Lin Tie was overjoyed and actively supported the Party Central Committee in rectifying wrongs, enthusiastically supporting the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. To achieve the cooperation and succession of old and new cadres, he took the initiative to step down to the second line. Despite his advanced age and frail health, he did beneficial work for the Party and the people. In opposing the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, he took a clear stand, firmly supporting the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

    Comrade Lin Tie had served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress and an advisor to the Central Organization Department. He was elected as a member of the Central Advisory Commission at the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party.

    Comrade Lin Tie was a highly respected veteran of our Party. He consistently adhered to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, maintaining political unity with the Central Committee. He strictly observed party discipline, obeyed the organization, and consciously maintained the party's centralized and unified leadership. He was upright and open-minded, endured hardships for the greater good, and maintained a broad perspective. He upheld principles, had a clean style of work, and resolutely fought against all harmful tendencies that endangered the Party's cause. He had a strong sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, worked diligently, was willing to take on hard work, took the initiative, and was efficient. He was strict with himself, kind to others, united with his comrades, connected with the masses, and cared for cadres. He studied diligently, thought deeply, and emphasized the combination of theory and practice. He was modest and cautious, set an example, was thrifty and hardworking, and was honest and upright.

    Comrade Lin Tie's life was a revolutionary life, a glorious life, a life dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly.

    Comrade Lin Tie will be forever remembered!

    林铁同志1904年11月出生在四川省万县一个乡村知识分子家庭。早在青少年时代，他就发愤读书，成绩优异，对帝国主义侵略者和军阀统治者深恶痛绝。在万县中学读书时，参加了学生反对日本轮船进入万州码头的斗争。1922年转入重庆联合中学读书，在我党早期青年运动领导人萧楚女、恽代英等同志的直接影响下，接受革命思想，积极参加反帝爱国学生运动，置身于革命斗争的洪流之中。1925年秋高中毕业后，相继在北京中国大学、中俄大学和法政大学读书，阅读了许多马列主义书籍，并积极参加李大钊同志领导的反对帝国主义侵略、反对段祺瑞政府卖国罪行的斗争。1926年11月在法政大学加入中国共产党。入党后担任党支部组织委员、代理党支部书记。从此走上职业革命家的道路，在极其险恶的环境下，积极从事革命活动。
