China's largest heavy ion accelerator, designed and constructed by the Institute of Modern Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is the largest in scale, with the most types of accelerated ions and the highest energy among heavy ion accelerators in China. It was completed and began operation on December 12, 1988. Recent expert appraisals and tests have shown that the main accelerator and its associated systems have reached the designed specifications, running stably. Its main performance indicators are on par with the advanced levels of similar accelerators in France and Japan, placing China's heavy ion cyclotron accelerators in the forefront of the international community.

The successful completion of the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator has promoted the development of related technologies in China, achieving several technological outcomes with significant social and economic benefits. During the construction period, 28 achievements won science and technology awards and technological progress awards from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator entered the practical application stage just 40 days after it began operation, marking the beginning of a new chapter in China's heavy ion physics research. Currently, efforts are underway to establish the Lanzhou Heavy Ion National Laboratory.

　　我国最大的重离子加速器
    中国科学院近代物理研究所自行设计并负责建造的兰州重离子加速器，是我国规模最大、加速离子种类最多、能量最高的重离子加速器。它于1988年12月12日建成出束。最近经专家鉴定测试表明，主加速器及其附层系统已达到设计指标，运行稳定，其主要性能指标与具有先进水平的法国和日本的主加速器水平相当，使我国重离子回旋加速器进入了国际先进行列。
    兰州重离子加速器胜利建成，促进了我国有关技术的发展，取得了一些具有显著社会效益和经济效益的技术成果。建设期间，有28项成果获中科院科技成果奖和技术进步奖。
    兰州重离子加速器建成出束仅40天即已进入实用阶段，揭开了我国重离子物理研究的新篇章。目前，正在积极筹建兰州重离子国家实验室。
