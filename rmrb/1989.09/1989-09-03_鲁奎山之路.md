In just over two years, a modernized medium-sized mine—Luokui Mountain Iron Mine—has taken shape before our eyes. This is a new approach that combines resource development with the development of local ethnic economies.

To increase the production capacity of Kunming Iron and Steel Company from 500,000 tons of steel per year to 900,000 tons is one of the key projects listed for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" in Yunnan. However, the biggest challenge is the source of iron ore. What to do? The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government decided to adopt a policy of separation and integration for the construction of Luokui Mountain Iron Mine and the expansion of Kunming Iron and Steel. That is, Kunming Iron and Steel is responsible for the expansion of the smelting and rolling mill, while the construction of Luokui Mountain Iron Mine is undertaken by the impoverished New Ping Yi and Dai Autonomous County. The investment in the mine is provided by Kunming Iron and Steel through compensation trade on a cost-free basis, with a contract construction method, where excess expenditures are not reimbursed, and savings belong to the mine. This approach effectively balances the interests of the state, the local area, and the farmers in the mining area.

Luokui Mountain Iron Mine is not far from Yangwu Small Town. The mine leadership takes advantage of this proximity, combining the mine's living and welfare facilities with the construction of Yangwu Town, focusing on expansion and renovation rather than duplicating construction. The funds used for the integration of the mine and the town total 1.37 million yuan. If the mine were to build a "small society" on its own, the minimum investment would be over 5 million yuan.

Since the mine's establishment, Luokui Mountain has adopted a policy of combining permanent workers, contract workers, rotating workers, and temporary workers. Of the current 426 employees, more than half are local Yi and Dai ethnic workers from the surrounding villages. They work in the mine during the day and study mining, mineral processing, machinery repair, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine at night, rotating back to their villages every three years.

Surrounding the main mine, there are six or seven small mining points, each organized and developed by the villages and towns. The large mine provides technical guidance and financial support, and the production and sales are also included in the plan. In 1988 alone, the small mining points produced 45,000 tons of iron ore. With a population of around 4,500 near Luokui Mountain, the per capita mining income reached 280 yuan.

    鲁奎山之路
    王嘉栋
    时间才两年多，一座初具规模的现代化中型矿山——鲁奎山铁矿已展现在人们面前。这是开发资源与发展当地民族经济相结合走出的新路子。
    把昆明钢铁公司年产钢50万吨的生产能力提高到90万吨，是列入“七五”期间云南的重点建设项目。然而，遇到的最大难题是铁矿石的来源问题。怎么办？省委、省政府决定鲁奎山铁矿建设和昆钢改扩建工程实行有分有合的方针，即昆钢负责冶炼轧钢厂的改扩建，鲁奎山铁矿的建设由贫困的新平彝族傣族自治县承担。铁矿投资由昆钢按有偿无息，以补偿贸易提供，实行包干建设，超支不补，节约归己。这样做，较好地兼顾了国家、地方和矿区农民的三者利益。
    鲁奎山铁矿与扬武小集镇相距较近，矿领导利用这一优势，把矿山的生活福利设施和当地扬武镇的建设尽量结合起来，只搞改扩建，不搞重复建设。矿山用于矿镇结合的资金共计137万元，如果矿山自己建设一个“小社会”，最低限度的投资也得500多万元。
    从办矿之日起，鲁奎山就实行固定工、合同工、轮换工和临时工相结合的用工办法。现在的426名职工，来自当地村寨的彝、傣族职工占了一半多。到矿上既当工人又当学生，白天做工，晚上学习采矿选矿、机修、畜牧兽医等知识，3年轮换回乡。
    主体矿周围，有六七个小矿点，分别由村、镇组织开发，大矿在技术上指导，资金上扶持，产销也纳入计划，仅1988年小矿点生产的铁矿石就达4.5万吨，按鲁奎山附近4500人口计算，人均采矿收入达到280元。
