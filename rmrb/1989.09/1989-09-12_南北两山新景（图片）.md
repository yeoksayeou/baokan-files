The entire province looks to Lanzhou for greening, and Lanzhou looks to the South and North Mountains. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians in Lanzhou City have persisted in greening the South and North Mountains, turning the previously barren hills into 64,000 mu of green landscape, accumulating timber worth over 200 million yuan. The Gaolan Mountain summit park and Renshou Mountain have become popular destinations for citizens to enjoy on holidays. The picture shows a corner of the North Mountain.

　　南北两山新景
    “全省绿化看兰州，兰州绿化看两山。”兰州市广大军民坚持不懈地绿化南北两山，使过去的荒山秃岭已有6.4万亩披上了绿装，积蓄木材价值2亿多元。皋兰山山顶公园和仁寿山已成为市民假日游玩的好去处。图为北山一角。
