Approximately 100,000 people marched and demonstrated in major cities across Argentina, including the capital Buenos Aires, on the night of September 8 to protest the government's possible pardon of military officers convicted or currently on trial for human rights abuses.

According to official estimates, about 40,000 people participated in the march in the capital. Tens of thousands of citizens also held large-scale protests in cities such as Rosario, Cordoba, and Tucuman. It is believed that this was the largest anti-government protest in nearly 10 years. The demonstration was organized by various human rights organizations and left-wing political parties. Some members of the ruling Justice Party and the largest opposition party, the Radical Civic Union, also joined the march.

During the military rule from 1976 to 1983, Argentine military forces, under the pretext of suppressing left-wing guerrillas, arrested and killed thousands of innocent people. After the civilian government took over, some military officers involved in human rights abuses were put on trial, which caused dissatisfaction within the military. President Menem, who took office on July 8, stated that he would resolve this issue completely and was preparing to pardon the convicted or currently on trial military personnel.

　　抗议赦免侵犯人权的军官
　　阿根廷群众举行示威
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯9月9日电　阿根廷约10万人8日晚在包括首都布宜诺斯艾利斯在内的全国各大城市举行游行示威，抗议政府可能赦免因侵犯人权而被判刑或正在受审的军官。
    据官方估计，在首都约有4万人参加了游行。数以万计的市民在罗萨里奥、科尔多瓦和土库曼等城市也举行了声势浩大的示威。据认为，这是近10年来规模最大的反政府示威。这次示威活动是由一些人权组织和左派政党组织的。执政的正义党和最大反对党激进公民联盟的一些议员也参加了游行。
    阿根廷军人在1976年至1983年执政期间，曾以镇压左派游击队为借口，逮捕并杀害了数以千计的无辜者。文人执政后，审判了一些侵犯人权的军官，引起军队的不满。梅内姆总统今年7月8日就职后表示要彻底解决这个问题，准备赦免被判刑或正在受审的军人。
