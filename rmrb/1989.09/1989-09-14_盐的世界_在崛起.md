	The World of Salt is Rising

	Known as the "Treasure Basin," Qaidam is truly a "world of salt." Within this 250,000-square-kilometer expanse, numerous inland salt lakes of various sizes are scattered about. The largest, the Chahansilake Salt Lake, covers an area 50 square kilometers larger than Shanghai. The thick, solid salt crust, the shimmering brine, the colorful salt flowers... the salt mountains, salt seas, and salt roads—all of these are truly breathtaking. This place not only has enough sodium salt to supply the entire nation's 1.1 billion people for 10,000 years but also boasts the largest reserves of potassium, magnesium, lithium, and other members of the "salt family" in the country. It is a rich and magical place!

	However, the "Salt Lake Kingdom" will not automatically turn "salt into treasure." It has slept for millions of years, but the birth of New China awakened this "crystal palace," and since the 1950s, it has welcomed pioneers from various ethnic groups.

	In the hometown of white salt—the Chaka Salt Lake—after 40 years of construction, the transition from manual salt harvesting to mechanical harvesting and then to ship-based harvesting has been achieved twice. By 1986, the annual production of white salt here was 400 times that of the early days of liberation. Currently, efforts are being made to transition from ship-based harvesting and truck transportation to ship-based harvesting and transportation, moving towards the goal of modernized production.

	In the Chahansilake Salt Lake, after 31 years of arduous struggle, this place has become the largest potassium fertilizer production base in the country. The first phase of the Qinghai Potassium Fertilizer Factory, with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of potassium fertilizer, has been completed, and its products are being shipped to various parts of the country.

	With the rise of the reform and opening-up wave in recent years, Qinghai Province has made large-scale development of salt lake resources a strategic move to revitalize and expand the province's economy, with arrangements made in terms of funds, talent, technology, energy, transportation, and other aspects. Last year, the production and sales of raw salt in Qaidam exceeded 100 million tons, and the products have evolved from a single variety to eight varieties, sold across the country and even entering the Hong Kong market.

### “盐的世界”在崛起

    “盐的世界”在崛起
    素有“聚宝盆”之称的柴达木，是一个名副其实的“盐的世界”。在这25万平方公里的土地上，星罗棋布地分布着几十个大大小小的内陆盐湖，其中最大的察尔汗盐湖，面积比上海市还大50多平方公里。那丰厚结实的盐盖，那碧波粼粼的卤水，那五彩纷呈的盐花……盐的山，盐的海，盐的路，简直令人目不暇接。这里不仅有可供全国11亿人食用1万年的钠盐，还有储量名列“神州之最”的钾、镁、锂等庞大的盐氏家族。这是一个富饶而神奇的地方！
    然而，“盐湖王国”不会自动变“盐”为宝，它沉睡了千万年，是新中国诞生的礼炮震醒了这个“水晶深宫”，使它从50年代开始，迎来了各族开拓者。
    在青盐的故乡——茶卡盐湖，经过40年的建设，已实现了从人工采盐到采盐机采盐进而用采盐船采盐的两次飞跃。到1986年，该盐湖年产青盐已相当于解放初期的400倍。目前，这里还准备变船采车运为船采船运，向生产现代化的目标驶进。
    在察尔汗盐湖，经过31年的艰苦创业，这里已成为全国最大的钾肥生产基地，年产20万吨钾肥的青海钾肥厂一期工程已竣工，产品源源不断销往祖国各地。
    随着近几年改革开放大潮的兴起，青海省已把大规模开发盐湖资源作为事关全省经济振兴、拓展的战略之举，在资金、人才、技术、能源、交通等方面均作了部署。去年，柴达木的原盐生产、销售已突破双百万吨大关，产品已由单一品种发展到8个品种，行销各地，并进入香港市场。　（何士荣）（附图片）
