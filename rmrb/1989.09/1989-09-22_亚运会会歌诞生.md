The anthem for the 11th Asian Games, "Raise High the Torch of the Asian Games," has been officially confirmed.

The lyrics are elegant, the melody solemn, and the overall atmosphere grand. The lyrics were written by Shi Xiang, and the music was composed by Shi Guangnan.

In an innovative move, the Asian Games this time also features a flag-raising song. "Rise, Sun of Asia," submitted by Yang Yong and Liu Hong, has been selected.

The selection process for the Asian Games songs took nearly two years. Recently, members of the Asian Games organizing committee and prominent figures from the music industry, including Wu Zuqiang, Shi Le Meng, and Qiao Yu, reviewed a large number of submitted entries. Ultimately, more than 20 songs were chosen for the Asian Games.

    亚运会会歌诞生
    新华社北京9月20日电  （记者许基仁李莉）《高举起亚运会的火炬》已被确定为第十一届北京亚运会的会歌。
    这首歌歌词潇洒、旋律庄重、气势宏博。作词谱曲者分别是石祥和施光南。
    这次亚运会别出心裁地设置了升旗歌。杨勇、刘虹献上的《升腾吧，亚细亚的太阳》中选。
    亚运会歌曲的选定历时近两年。最近，亚运会组委会人士和吴祖强、时乐濛、乔羽等音乐界名流对大量征集稿进行了审议，最后评定了20余首亚运会歌曲。
