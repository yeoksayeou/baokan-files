	Yang Shangkun Meets with the Wife of the Bangladeshi President
	Host and Guest Highly Praise Sino-Bangladesh Friendship

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st – (Reporter: Yu Yunlong) State Chairman Yang Shangkun met with the wife of the Bangladeshi President, Roshan Ershad, and her entourage this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

	Yang Shangkun first, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to Roshan Ershad’s visit. He said, the development of Sino-Bangladesh relations has been very smooth, and China is satisfied with the cooperation between the two countries. Bangladesh has shown understanding towards China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots, which is a precious manifestation of friendship.

	Yang Shangkun said, China needs stability. After the suppression of the riots, the situation in Beijing and throughout the country has stabilized. Currently, the country is carrying out a large-scale education campaign on patriotism and hard work, which will continue for a considerable period. China will strive to cooperate with foreign countries, but such cooperation must be based on mutual benefit. Attempts to use cooperation to exert pressure on China or impose sanctions will never achieve their goals. The road must be walked by ourselves, and we cannot rely on others to build China.

	He requested Roshan Ershad to convey to President Ershad that China's situation is stable. China will continue with reform and opening up, correct some mistakes and shortcomings in the work, and have the confidence to make up for the losses incurred in a certain period.

	Roshan Ershad also highly praised the Sino-Bangladesh friendship. She said, this is her fifth visit to China, and China is like her second home.

	She said, during this visit, she attended the completion ceremony of the new building for the Sino-Bangladesh Friendship Primary School (Beijing First Experimental Primary School). In Bangladesh, there is a friendship bridge built with Chinese aid. These are symbols of the friendship between the two countries.

	At the end of the meeting, Roshan Ershad reiterated President Ershad's invitation to Yang Shangkun to visit Bangladesh. Yang Shangkun expressed his thanks and agreed to visit at an appropriate time in the future.

    杨尚昆会见孟总统夫人
    宾主高度评价中孟友谊
    新华社北京9月21日电  （记者朱云龙）国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见了孟加拉国总统的夫人罗珊·艾尔沙德一行。
    杨尚昆首先代表中国政府和人民对罗珊·艾尔沙德来访表示热烈欢迎。他说，中孟两国关系发展很顺利，中国对两国的合作表示满意。孟加拉国对中国平息反革命暴乱一事表示理解，这是珍贵友谊的表现。
    杨尚昆说，中国需要安定。平暴后，北京、全国的局势稳定。目前，全国正在开展相当规模的关于爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的教育活动，这类活动要进行相当长的一段时间。中国要努力与外国开展合作，但是这种合作必须建立在互利的基础上。想利用合作对中国施加压力或制裁是无论如何达不到目的的。路还是靠我们自己走，不能靠人家来走，不能靠人家来建设中国。
    他请罗珊·艾尔沙德转告艾尔沙德总统，中国的局势是稳定的。中国要继续改革开放，要改正工作中的一些缺点、失误，有信心把一段时间内的损失补回来。
    罗珊·艾尔沙德也高度评价了孟中友谊。她说，这是她第五次访华，中国是她第二故乡。
    她说，她这次访华期间出席了中孟友谊小学（北京第一实验小学）新校舍的竣工典礼。在孟加拉国，有一座中国援建的友谊大桥。这些都是两国友谊的象征。
    会见结束时，罗珊·艾尔沙德重申了艾尔沙德总统对杨尚昆关于访问孟加拉国的邀请。杨尚昆对此表示感谢，并答应将来在适当的时机去访问。
