The Education Commission of Qionglai County recently uncovered a serious case involving Xu Guangli, the director of the examination center in Sangyuan Town, who, during this year's preliminary examinations for high school, normal school, and vocational school admissions, colluded with others to engage in impersonation and sell examination questions, extorting over 13,000 yuan from the parents of examinees. Xu Guangli and another accomplice, Zheng Jimin, have been arrested.

In May of this year, Xu Guangli, who was then the principal of Sangyuan Middle School, learned that Sangyuan Town would set up an examination center and that he would be the director. He then told Zheng Jimin, the deputy principal of Sangyuan Middle School and an accomplice, "This time, we should gain both fame and fortune." They approached the parents of some former students, claiming that if the parents were willing to pay a sum of money, they could help their children get into school.

　  伙同他人营私舞弊索贿万余元
　　邛崃县一考场主任被逮捕
    新华社成都9月17日电（记者杨力）四川省邛崃县教委最近查实了这个县桑园镇考场主任徐光立，在今年高中、中师和中专招生的预选考试中，指使、伙同他人搞冒名顶替，出卖考题，从考生家长手中非法索取现金13000多元的严重案件。徐光立和另一案犯郑济民已被依法逮捕。
    今年5月，身为桑园中学校长的徐光立在得知桑园镇要设中考考场并且他将担任考场主任后，就对同案犯、桑园中学教导主任郑济民说，这次考试，咱们要“名利双收”。他们找到一些往届毕业生的家长，声称若家长肯出一笔钱，他们可以为其孩子考上学校帮忙。待一些家长同意并交款后，他们即用改名换姓的办法，把这些学生的名字改成即将毕业但实际上已辍学的学生名字，参加了中考。
    与此同时，他们又用200元钱买通了管理试卷的保密员，盗出语文、数学、物理、化学、政治、英语的试卷，复写成若干份，分头交给那些答应交钱或已经交了钱的考生看。钱迷心窍的“考场官”就这样坐收巨利13000多元。
    为严肃考纪、刹住邪风，邛崃县教委已作出决定：所有冒名顶考的考生和看过试卷的考生，今年的考试成绩一律作废。
