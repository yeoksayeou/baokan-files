Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: China's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" (1986-1990) biotechnology breakthroughs have achieved remarkable results. By the end of June this year, 50 technological achievements have been made. Eight of these have already been applied in production, 12 have the conditions for promotion, 10 can be promoted in the early stage of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" (1991-1995), and 24 are expected to be accepted this year. China still maintains a leading position in certain fields of biotechnology.

The development of the hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine through genetic engineering, undertaken by the Institute of Virology at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is the top priority of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" breakthroughs. It has now entered the pilot production stage. Once officially produced, the annual output value can reach 210 million to 330 million yuan, which can meet the needs of national immunization plans for newborns and high-risk groups. The external use of 2D-interferon has completed the pilot and clinical trials ahead of schedule, and the product will be launched in the market this year with an annual output value of 50 million yuan. The injection form can reach an annual output value of 700 million yuan.

The Institute of Microbiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully constructed tobacco plants engineered to be resistant to tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus for the first time in the country. If promoted, this could reduce annual losses of 700 million yuan in the three major tobacco-producing regions of Henan, Shandong, and Northeast China.

　　生物技术攻关进展快
　　三年取得成果五十项
    本报讯　记者蒋建科报道：我国“七五”生物技术攻关取得可喜成就。截至今年6月底，已取得攻关科技成果50项，8项已在生产中发挥作用，12项具备推广条件，10项能在“八五”前期推广，24项预计在年内验收。我国在生物技术的某些领域仍保持世界领先地位。
    由中国预防医学科学院病毒所和中国科学院上海生化所等承担的乙型肝炎表面抗原基因工程疫苗的研制是“七五”攻关的头号任务，现已进入中试阶段，正式投产后，年产值可达2.1亿—3.3亿元，能保证全国新生婴儿和高危人群计划免疫的需要。外用型2D—干扰素提前完成中试和临床试验，产品年内即可投放市场，年产值5000万元，针剂年产值可达7亿元。
    中国科学院微生物所在国内首次成功地构建抗烟草花叶病毒和抗黄瓜花叶病毒的烟草工程植株，如推广开来，仅河南、山东、东北3大烟草产区每年可减少7亿元的损失。
