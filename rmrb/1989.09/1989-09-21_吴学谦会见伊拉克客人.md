Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian met with Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Zahawi this afternoon at Zhongnanhai.

Wu Xueqian briefed Zahawi on the recent situation in China. Zahawi said that Iraq is pleased to see China suppress the counter-revolutionary riots and restore stability. He said that Iraq has always opposed the use of human rights issues to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and to instigate incidents. Iraq opposes international organizations or agencies listing issues that are purely China's internal affairs on their agendas.

Wu Xueqian reiterated that China's policy of opening up to the outside world remains unchanged. He said that China's opening up is all-encompassing. In addition to continuing to develop trade and economic cooperation with developed countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, China places more emphasis on strengthening economic cooperation with Third World countries. He expressed China's willingness to further develop friendly and cooperative relations with Iraq and other Arab countries.

During the conversation, Zahawi briefed Wu Xueqian on the progress of the Iran-Iraq peace talks. Wu Xueqian expressed that China hopes Iraq and Iran can achieve further reconciliation and lasting peace. China will make its own efforts for this.

Zahawi arrived in Beijing yesterday.

    吴学谦会见伊拉克客人
    新华社北京9月20日电　吴学谦副总理今天下午在中南海会见了伊拉克外交部次长扎哈维。
    吴学谦向扎哈维次长介绍了最近中国国内情况。扎哈维说，伊拉克对中国平息反革命暴乱，重新恢复稳定感到欣慰。他说，伊拉克一贯反对利用人权问题来干涉别国内政，挑起事端。伊拉克反对国际组织或机构把纯属中国内政问题列入议程。
    吴学谦重申，中国的对外开放政策不变。他说，中国的对外开放是全方位的。除了同发达国家在平等互利基础上继续开展贸易和经济合作之外，中国更重视同第三世界国家加强经济合作。他表示中国愿同伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家进一步发展友好合作关系。
    在交谈中，扎哈维向吴学谦通报了两伊和谈的进展情况。吴学谦表示，中国希望伊拉克和伊朗求得进一步和解，实现持久和平。中国将为此作出自己的努力。
    扎哈维是昨天到达北京的。
