On September 16, the Arab League's three-party committee, which is mediating the Lebanese crisis, issued a communiqué in the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah, proposing an immediate comprehensive ceasefire across Lebanon. Syria and various Muslim factions in Lebanon immediately expressed their support. On September 22, Lebanese Christian leader Aoun also announced his acceptance of the Jeddah proposal. The Arab League's mediation efforts have finally brought a glimmer of hope to the long-troubled situation in Lebanon.

The Arab League's seven-point peace proposal includes the following key points: all factions in Lebanon should immediately cease fire; establish a Lebanese Security Committee headed by Arab League envoy Ibrahim Salih to supervise the ceasefire; lift the blockade and reopen airports and ports; urge relevant countries to stop supplying weapons; and call for the Lebanese parliament to convene on September 30 to discuss a reconciliation document. Arab countries and the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries have all expressed support for the Jeddah peace proposal. Arab public opinion believes that the Jeddah proposal is the Arab League's "latest and final effort" to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

According to Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal, who revealed on September 18, the Jeddah communiqué issued by the Arab League's three-party committee is the first phase of the overall peace plan for Lebanon. The second phase is to implement a national reconciliation plan based on the ceasefire, mainly including four parts: 1, general provisions and reforms; 2, methods to restore national sovereignty; 3, liberating Lebanon from Israeli occupation; 4, Syrian-Lebanese relations. This yet-to-be-published document stipulates that once the Lebanese parliament meeting scheduled for the end of September approves the reconciliation plan and subsequently elects a president, forms a coalition government, and establishes constitutional political reform clauses, Syrian troops will assist the Lebanese legal military to restore national authority within two years at the latest. After the two-year period, based on Syrian-Lebanese consultations, Syrian troops will be deployed to the Bekaa Valley, Deir al-Qamar, and other areas. Then, Syria and Lebanon will sign an agreement to determine the number and duration of Syrian troops stationed in the aforementioned regions. It is reported that Aoun had previously requested the Arab League to provide a "written guarantee" of Syrian withdrawal before accepting the Jeddah proposal.

Since May of this year, the Arab League's three-party committee, consisting of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria, has frequently shuttled between Beirut, Damascus, and Baghdad, proposing one after another to achieve a ceasefire and political reconciliation, but none have been effective. By the end of July, the Arab League's three-party committee had announced in Algiers that mediation efforts had stalled. Almost simultaneously, the Lebanese civil war and hostage crisis intertwined, with the French fleet approaching Lebanese waters under the pretext of rescuing 7,000 French expatriates. The United States also repeatedly stated that it would not rule out the possibility of using force to rescue hostages. The internationalization of the Lebanese crisis prompted the Arab League to resume its mediation efforts in Lebanon.

Currently, the two main opposing factions in Lebanon have both accepted the Jeddah proposal, but there are still significant differences regarding the specific arrangements for the ceasefire and future political reforms. In the unprecedented scale of Lebanese shelling that began in March, the Christian faction raised the slogan of "liberating Lebanon" and demanded the complete withdrawal of Syrian troops. However, Syria and the Lebanese Muslim factions represented by Prime Minister Hoss expressed that the Lebanese military government led by Aoun is illegal and accused the Christian faction of rejecting the "Syrian choice" and obstructing Lebanese political reform. On the other hand, France and other Western European countries, as well as some Arab factions, either diplomatically supported or provided material and military aid to the Lebanese Christian faction to counter the opposing side. Israel also took the opportunity to intensify its occupation and invasion of Lebanese territory, making the situation in Lebanon even more tense. Shortly before the Jeddah proposal was issued, American diplomats, ignoring Aoun's advice, decided to withdraw from the Christian-controlled eastern part of Beirut for security reasons. Arab public opinion believes that the Christian faction, feeling pressured in the Lebanese military struggle, has no choice but to accept the Jeddah proposal.

Currently, the warring factions in Lebanon have basically ceased fire, and the long-blockaded Beirut airport has reopened. The Lebanese parliament is scheduled to meet in Taif, Saudi Arabia, on September 30 to discuss the national reconciliation document. The Lebanese people, who have suffered 15 years of war, finally see a glimmer of hope for peace. In the future, to fundamentally resolve the Lebanese crisis, it will depend on whether the various factions in Lebanon can reach an agreement on future political reforms and national reconciliation. The presence of non-Lebanese troops in Lebanon is also an issue that needs to be resolved through consultation. Due to the intertwining of various contradictions and the constraints of internal and external factors, the road to peace in Lebanon will be long and arduous.

    吉达建议与黎巴嫩局势
    朱梦魁
    9月16日，调解黎巴嫩危机的阿盟三方委员会在沙特阿拉伯的吉达港发表公报，提出了在黎巴嫩全境立即实行全面停火的和平建议。对此，叙利亚和黎巴嫩穆斯林各派立即表示赞同。9月22日，黎巴嫩基督教派领导人奥恩也表示接受吉达建议。阿盟的调解努力，终于给战乱不休的黎巴嫩局势带来了缓和的转机。
    阿盟三方委员会的7点和平建议包括以下要点：黎各派立即全面停火；组成以阿盟特使易卜拉希米为首的黎巴嫩安全委员会，监督停火；解除封锁，开放机场、港口；呼吁各有关国家停止提供军火；呼吁黎议会9月30日开会，商讨和解文件。阿拉伯国家和美、苏、法等国都表示支持吉达和平建议。阿拉伯舆论认为，吉达建议是阿盟方面为解决黎巴嫩危机所作的“最新的也是最后的努力”。
    据沙特外交大臣费萨尔9月18日披露，阿盟三方委员会发表的吉达公报是黎巴嫩总体和平计划的第一阶段。第二阶段是在停火基础上实施全国和解计划，主要包括4个部分：1、总则和改革；2、恢复国家主权的方式；3、从以色列占领下解放黎巴嫩；4、叙黎关系。这项尚未公布的文件规定，一俟9月底召开的黎巴嫩议会会议通过和解计划，并进而选出总统、建立联合政府和由宪法确定政治改革条款后，驻黎叙军将帮助黎合法军队最迟在两年内恢复国家权威。两年期限之后，在叙黎协商基础上，叙军将部署到贝卡平原、代赫尔邦德尔等地。然后，再由叙黎签署协议，确定叙利亚在上述地区的驻军人数和驻军时间。据报道，奥恩在接受吉达建议之前，曾要求阿盟方面作出叙利亚撤军的“书面保证”。
    自今年5月以来，由沙特阿拉伯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚组成的阿盟三方委员会频繁穿梭于贝鲁特、大马士革和巴格达等之间，提出了一个又一个实现各方停火与政治和解的建议，但均未能奏效。7月底，阿盟三方委员会曾在阿尔及尔宣布，调解努力已经搁浅。几乎与此同时，黎巴嫩内战与人质危机相互交织，法国舰队以营救7000法侨为由开近黎巴嫩海域。美国也多次表示，不排除以武力解救人质的可能。黎巴嫩危机国际化的危险促使阿盟恢复在黎巴嫩的调解努力。
    当前，黎巴嫩两大对立面虽然都接受了吉达建议，但在有关停火的具体安排和未来的政治改革方面仍存在较大分歧。在自3月份爆发的这场规模空前的黎巴嫩炮战中，基督教派提出“解放黎巴嫩”的口号，要求叙利亚全部撤军。而叙利亚和以胡斯代总理为代表的黎巴嫩穆斯林各派认为，以奥恩为首的黎巴嫩军政府属于非法，并指责基督教派拒绝“叙利亚选择”，阻挠黎巴嫩政治改革。另一方面，法国等西欧国家和某些阿拉伯方面或以外交声援或以提供物资和军火支持黎基督教派与对立面抗衡。以色列也乘机加剧对黎巴嫩领土的占领和入侵，致使黎巴嫩局势更趋紧张。在吉达建议发表前不久，美国外交人员不顾奥恩的劝告，以安全为由决定撤出基督教派控制的贝鲁特东区。阿拉伯舆论认为，在黎巴嫩军事角逐中感到压力重重的基督教派除接受吉达建议之外已别无选择。
    目前，黎巴嫩交战各方已基本停火，长期被封锁的贝鲁特机场重新开放，黎巴嫩议会定于9月30日将在沙特阿拉伯的塔伊夫开会，讨论全国和解文件。饱受15年战火劫难的黎巴嫩人民终于看到了一线和平的曙光。今后，要根本解除黎巴嫩危机，还取决于黎巴嫩各方能否就未来的政治改革和民族和解达成协议。非黎巴嫩军队在黎巴嫩的存在也是一个有待协商解决的问题。由于多种矛盾的交织和内外因素的制约，实现黎巴嫩和平的道路将是漫长而艰难的。
