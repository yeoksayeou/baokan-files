The Chinese delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union's 82nd annual conference on September 6 called on developed countries to help developing countries develop their economies and to properly address the debt issues of third world countries through negotiations.

Hu Dewa, a member of the delegation, said at the plenary session of the conference, "For many developing countries, there are not only population and food problems, but also heavy external debt problems." She said that the total external debt of developing countries has already exceeded $1 trillion, and the annual repayment rate of many countries has far exceeded the dangerous limit. This requires joint efforts from both developing and developed countries to find solutions. Developed countries have the responsibility to help them.

Hu Dewa made the remarks on behalf of the Chinese delegation during the conference's discussion on population and food balance, as well as solving debt and food problems.

She said that China's family planning policy has not only promoted the development of Chinese society and economy but also contributed to the stability of the world's population.

In discussing the food issue, she said that China, with only 7% of the world's arable land, feeds 22% of the world's population. She also said that China will continue to implement rural reforms and develop grain production. She called for further strengthening international economic cooperation and technology transfer in the field of grain.

    我代表呼吁发达国家
    妥善解决发展中国家债务
    新华社伦敦9月7日电  （记者王生良）中国人大代表团6日在各国议会联盟82届年会上呼吁发达国家帮助发展中国家发展经济，通过协商妥善解决第三世界国家的债务问题。
    人大代表团成员胡德华在议联大会全体会议上说，“对许多发展中国家来说，不仅有人口问题、粮食问题，还有沉重的外债问题。她说，现在发展中国家的外债总额已突破1万亿美元，许多国家的年偿还率已大大超过危险的界限。”这需要发展中国家和发达国家共同努力寻求解决问题的办法。发达国家有责任帮助他们。
    胡德华是在大会讨论人口和粮食平衡及解决债务和温饱问题的议题时代表中国人大代表团发言的。
    她说，中国实行计划生育不仅促进了中国社会和经济的发展，而且也有利于世界人口的稳定。
    在谈到粮食问题时，她说，中国以仅占世界7％的耕地，养活着占世界22％的人口。她还说，中国将继续实行农村改革，发展粮食生产。她呼吁进一步加强粮食领域里的国际经济合作和技术转移。
