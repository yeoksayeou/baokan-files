The Geneva Conference resumed discussions on the Indochina issue on May 8. In addition to the five major powers, the participants included the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, South Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Soviet Union and Britain took turns as the conference chairpersons.

During the conference, an interesting incident occurred. The acting head of the U.S. delegation, Deputy Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, had been a general under Eisenhower during World War II. The head of the U.S. delegation to the Geneva Conference was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, with Herter as his deputy. One week after the conference began, Dulles returned to the U.S., and Herter took over as acting head.

Dulles was fanatically anti-communist and hostile to New China. He had personally ordered U.S. delegation members not to shake hands with Chinese delegation members. However, Molotov told Premier Zhou that before Dulles arrived in Geneva, Herter had expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy in a conversation with Molotov, believing that the U.S. policy of hostility towards China was unrealistic. Premier Zhou attached great importance to this information.

During a break in one of the meetings, various representatives were in the lounge drinking coffee and chatting. Herter suddenly walked over to me and struck up a conversation. I was Premier Zhou's interpreter at the time. Herter started by complimenting my English and then spoke admiringly of Chinese ancient culture, displaying a very friendly attitude. This unusual behavior drew Premier Zhou's attention. Premier Zhou always believed that we should not reject contact with the Americans, even if Dulles led the delegation, it was not an iron bloc. We should not miss any opportunity to do work. Therefore, Premier Zhou decided to take the initiative to contact Herter. During another break in the meeting, various representatives crowded into the lounge. Premier Zhou, under the gaze of all, walked over to Herter. This completely caught Herter off guard. He hurriedly held his coffee cup in his right hand, and when Premier Zhou extended his right hand, Herter awkwardly shook Premier Zhou's right arm with his left hand a few times. Premier Zhou paid no attention to this, and had a friendly chat with him. At that time, the contrast presented to the representatives of various countries was striking: on one side was Premier Zhou's composure and magnanimity; on the other side was the American representative's embarrassment, caught off guard by the rigid anti-China policy.

The conference made no significant progress over more than a month. It was not until mid-June, when domestic contradictions in France intensified and the Laniel government fell, that Pierre Mendès France, who was inclined to end the Indochina War as soon as possible, was entrusted with forming a cabinet. This finally made it possible for the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement. During the conference, Premier Zhou worked closely with the Soviet and Vietnamese delegations, striving to win the support of the majority of the participating countries, and concentrating on opposing U.S. obstruction and sabotage. He actively and proactively engaged in cooperative activities, seizing the opportunity to propose plans that considered the interests of all parties in the conference, becoming the main driving force behind the conference's progress.

The conference was deadlocked for a long time on two issues. The first issue was, after the ceasefire in Vietnam, the demarcation line between the two sides' armed forces, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on one side and France and South Vietnam on the other, would be drawn where. The second issue was how to handle the issues of Laos and Cambodia separately from the Vietnamese issue.

Through frequent contacts outside the conference, Premier Zhou understood the doubts of France, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia on the issues of Laos and Cambodia. On June 16, just three days after the Mendès France government took office, Premier Zhou proposed a plan to solve the issues of Laos and Cambodia at the conference, which had been previously agreed upon with the Soviet Union and Vietnam. The core idea of this plan was that "the issues of the three Indochina countries are both related and distinct. When applying the same principles, the special circumstances of the three countries should be considered." This plan's fairness and spirit of cooperation were praised by the majority of the participating countries. It was like a breath of spring, reviving the conference that had been at a standstill for a month and a half.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou focused his efforts on resolving the issue of the demarcation line between North and South Vietnam. On June 23, Premier Zhou met with French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France in Bern, Switzerland. Premier Zhou's words were sincere, both far-sighted and combined with France's immediate interests, deeply moving Mendès France. He expressed to Premier Zhou his determination to achieve a ceasefire within a month. If unsuccessful, he would resign. From early July to mid-July, the Geneva Conference adjourned. Premier Zhou used this time to first meet with Chairman Ho Chi Minh in Liuzhou, Guangxi, and then with Soviet leaders in Moscow to coordinate their views. The three countries agreed that making excessive demands on the demarcation line issue was unrealistic and would easily allow the U.S. to succeed in its plot to sabotage the conference. They should strive for a compromise to stop the war. After the Geneva Conference resumed, Premier Zhou immediately threw himself into intense mediation work. Within a few days, Vietnam and France finally reached a compromise.

The breakthroughs in the issues of Laos and Cambodia and the demarcation line between North and South Vietnam led to agreements on a series of other issues. The U.S., watching the conference reach a series of agreements, was helpless yet unwilling to accept it, and finally announced that it would not participate in the final declaration, placing itself in a completely isolated position.

The achievements of the Geneva Conference exceeded expectations. What was even more surprising was that the new China, participating in a major international conference for the first time, played a particularly important role in the conference's success. Premier Zhou Enlai, through his effective diplomatic activities during the conference, presented a new and impressive image and style of New China on the international political stage. The world also came to know Zhou Enlai, this outstanding statesman and diplomat, through this conference. His wisdom, character, demeanor, and talent won widespread admiration and respect.

    第一次日内瓦会议的回忆（二）
　　浦寿昌
    日内瓦会议在5月8日又开始进行印度支那问题的讨论。参加讨论的除了五大国之外，还有越南民主共和国、南越、老挝王国和柬埔寨王国。苏联和英国轮流担任会议主席。
    在会议期间，有一段有趣的事。
    美国代表团代理团长、副国务卿史密斯原是二次大战中艾森豪威尔麾下的一名将军。出席日内瓦会议的美国代表团团长是国务卿杜勒斯，史密斯是副团长。会议开始一星期后杜勒斯回国，史密斯担任代理团长。
    杜勒斯反共、敌视新中国达到疯狂的地步。他曾亲自下令禁止美国代表团人员同中国代表团人员握手。但是，莫洛托夫告诉周总理，在杜勒斯抵日内瓦前他同史密斯的一次交往中，史密斯曾流露出对美国外交政策的不满，认为美国对中国实行敌对政策是不现实的。周总理对这条信息非常重视。
    在某次会议的休息时间，各国代表都在休息大厅喝咖啡聊天，史密斯忽然走到我的跟前，同我攀谈。我当时是周总理的翻译。史密斯从夸我的英语说到对中国古代文化的敬慕，态度很友好。这样一个不寻常的举动，引起了周总理的重视。周总理始终认为，我们不应该拒绝同美国接触，即使是杜勒斯亲自率领的代表团也不是铁板一块。我们不应该放弃任何可以做工作的机会。因此，周总理决定主动去同史密斯接触。在另一次会议的休息时间，各国代表又挤满了休息大厅。周总理在众目睽睽之下，主动走向史密斯。这完全出乎史密斯的意外。他连忙把咖啡杯捧在右手，等周总理向他伸出右手，他很尴尬地用左手握住周总理的右臂摇晃了几下。周总理毫不介意，同他友好地聊了一阵子。当时展现在各国代表眼前的是一个鲜明的对比：一边是周总理的从容不迫、豁达大度；另一边是美国代表被僵硬的对华政策弄得手足无措的窘态。
    会议在一个多月的时间里没有什么显著的进展。直到6月中旬，法国国内矛盾尖锐化，拉尼埃政府倒台，倾向于早日结束印支战争的孟戴斯—弗朗斯受命组阁，这才使日内瓦会议出现了取得协议的可能。周总理在会议过程中，同苏联和越南代表团紧密合作，尽力争取与会国的多数，集中反对美国的阻挠和破坏。他积极主动地展开合作活动，不失时机地在会议中提出照顾到各方面利益的方案，成为推动会议前进的主要人物。
    会议在两个问题上长期争执不下。第一个问题是，在越南停战以后，越南民主共和国为一方，法国和南越为另一方的双方武装力量，将分别集中到越南北部和南部的集结区，但是南北集结区之间界线究竟划在什么地方。第二个问题是，老挝和柬埔寨问题如何同越南问题区别对待。
  　通过会外的频繁接触，周总理摸清楚了法国、老挝王国和柬埔寨王国在老挝和柬埔寨问题上的疑虑。6月16日，也就是在孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府上台3天之后，周总理在会议上提出事先同苏联和越南确定的解决老挝和柬埔寨问题的方案。这个方案的中心思想是“印度支那三国的问题既有联系，又有区别。在适用同样原则时，要照顾到三国的特殊情况。这个方案表现的公正态度和协作精神，受到大多数与会国的赞扬，它像一阵春风，使僵持了一个半月的会议恢复了生机。
    接着，周总理又集中精力为解决越南南北分界线问题而努力。6月23日，周总理在瑞士伯尔尼同法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯会晤。周总理的一席谈话，言辞恳切，既高瞻远瞩，又结合法国的切身利益，使孟戴斯—弗朗斯深受感动。他向总理表示，决心要以一个月如期实现停火。如果不成，他将提出辞职。从7月初到7月中旬，日内瓦会议休会。周总理利用这个时间，先在广西柳州同胡志明主席会谈，然后在莫斯科同苏联领导人会谈，协调彼此的看法。三国一致认为，在分界线问题上提出过高的要求，既不现实，又容易使美国破坏会议的计谋得逞，应该力争达成妥协，把战争停下来。日内瓦会议复会以后，周总理立即投入了紧张的斡旋工作。几天之内，越南和法国终于达成了妥协。
    会议在老挝和柬埔寨问题及越南南北分界线问题上取得的突破，导致了对其他一系列问题的协议。美国眼看着会议达成一系列协议，无可奈何而又不甘心，最后宣布不参加会议的最后宣言，把自己放在完全孤立的地位。
    日内瓦会议的成就，超过了人们的预料。尤其使人感到意外的是，为会议的成功起了特殊重要作用的，竟是第一次参加大国国际会议的新中国。周恩来总理通过他在会议期间卓有成效的外交活动，使新中国以令人耳目一新的形象和风格在国际政治舞台上崭露头角。全世界也通过这次会议认识了周恩来这位卓越的政治家和外交家。他的智慧、品德、风度和才华，赢得了广泛的爱戴和敬佩。　（续完）
