Tobacco is a unique commodity. Because it is harmful to the human body, our country has been vigorously promoting smoking cessation and tobacco control among its citizens. On the other hand, the tobacco industry contributes a significant portion to both central and local government revenues. Therefore, many people still consider smoking as a necessity in their lives. Consequently, the tobacco industry cannot be abolished in our country at present. For this reason, the state implements a monopoly management system for tobacco. Any behavior that violates the tobacco monopoly regulations will be investigated and punished.

In recent years, as the standards for "addicts" have continuously risen, imported cigarettes, brand-name cigarettes, and high-quality cigarettes have become fashionable and popular items, appearing in circulation and social settings. Some lawless elements have taken advantage of this to engage in illegal activities such as smuggling, private dealing, and speculation. To ensure that the production and circulation of tobacco are carried out according to state plans and to guarantee state tax revenues, any tobacco cases that violate the tobacco monopoly regulations and criminal laws must be dealt with resolutely and thoroughly investigated.

Various types of tobacco cases are generally the result of internal and external collusion. Some officials in the transportation, tobacco monopoly, and judicial departments cannot resist the temptation of cigarettes and money, abuse their power, and provide cover for the illegal activities of lawless elements, even colluding with them. It can be said that without the internal support from these industry departments, it would be quite difficult for external lawless elements to easily take tobacco out of warehouses, load it onto planes, trains, and ships, and sell it everywhere. When investigating tobacco cases, while focusing on the illegal activities of lawless elements, those who "provide cover" in the relevant departments must be strictly investigated. Otherwise, the tobacco market will fall into chaos. The various levels of tobacco monopoly administration bureaus, which exercise tobacco monopoly administrative powers, must fulfill their responsibilities and closely cooperate with the industrial and commercial administration, pricing, taxation, banking, transportation, postal, public security, and customs departments to jointly manage, inspect, and supervise the tobacco industry, reducing and ultimately eliminating illegal and criminal tobacco cases.

### 查烟案　须坚决

    查烟案　须坚决
    烟草是一种特殊的商品。由于它对人体有害，所以我国已在公民中大力进行提倡戒烟、控制吸烟的宣传；又由于烟草工业在中央和地方财政收入中占有可观的比例，客观上许多群众还把吸烟作为生活的需要，所以烟草工业目前在我国还不能取消。为此，国家对烟草实行专卖管理。任何违反烟草专卖条例的行为，都要受到查处。
    近年来，随着“瘾君子”吸烟标准不断提高的趋势，进口烟、名牌烟、优质烟成为一种时髦货、走俏货，出现在流通领域和社交场所。一些不法分子便乘机进行烟草的走私贩私、投机倒把等违法犯罪活动。为了保证烟草的生产、流通按国家计划进行，保证国家的税收，对任何违反烟草专卖条例、触犯刑律的烟案，必须态度坚决，一查到底。
    那些形形色色的烟案，基本上是里应外合、内外勾结形成的。少数运输、烟草专卖、司法等部门的公职人员，禁不住香烟、金钱的诱惑，滥用职权，为不法分子的活动大开绿灯，甚至同流合污。可以说，没有这些行业部门的内应，外边的不法分子想轻而易举地把烟草从仓库里提出来，装上飞机、火车、轮船，走南闯北到处贩卖，那是相当困难的。查烟案，在查不法分子违法犯罪事实的同时，对那些“大开绿灯”部门的人和事，必须从严查处，否则烟草市场就会出现混乱局面。行使烟草专卖行政管理权力的各级烟草专卖局，要切实履行自己的职责，同工商行政、物价、税务、银行、交通运输、邮电、公安、海关等部门密切配合，共同做好烟草行业的管理、检查和监督工作，使违法犯罪的烟案尽量减少，以致杜绝。
