Sun Bang, a native of Jinan, Shandong, is over 50 years old, of average appearance, and of medium build. His suit is not elegant, his hairstyle is not meticulous, and he is not eloquent. But once he speaks, he does not back down. In his professional field, he admires the American style of basketball, envying the players who are not only tall but also agile.

At the beginning of the year, Sun Bang took over as the head coach of the Chinese men's basketball team, replacing the former head coach Qian Chenghai. Soon after, he made public his coaching philosophy: fast, accurate, and agile. Don't underestimate these three words; they caused quite a stir in the basketball community. Basketball is a sport for giants, where tall players have an advantage. Everyone knows this. Chinese players are tall in Asia but short compared to Europeans and Americans. Given that surpassing European and American teams is still a future goal, securing the top spot in Asia is naturally the main objective of the Chinese men's basketball team. During Qian Chenghai's tenure, the strategy was to use height to control speed, avoiding weaknesses and emphasizing strengths, a classic military strategy. The result was that Qian Chenghai's team won the Asian Men's Basketball Championship six times. The achievements were indeed impressive.

Sun Bang, whose reputation and influence are far below Qian Chenghai's, immediately changed the strategy from using height to control speed to using speed to control speed. How could the basketball world not be shaken? At the Capital Gymnasium, Coach Sun Bang spoke to reporters about his views on the sensitive issue of height versus speed. "American basketball players are tall, but their speed is not slower than that of the Chinese team. The Chinese team is taller than others in Asia, so wouldn't it be better if we were also faster than them?" The reporter was speechless.

When selecting new national team members, Sun Bang favors those who are both tall and fast, and he has not sacrificed height requirements to choose players who can run quickly. This is Sun Bang's approach of "seeking speed on the basis of height." "So, Coach Sun, what assurance do you have that your team can be faster than South Korea, which has always relied on speed to win?" "Training!" he replied, seemingly without hesitation, perhaps because he had thought about it a thousand times.

Those who endure hardship will succeed. When building his new team, Sun Bang chose players who were willing to train hard and discarded those who could not endure the hardships of training—even if they were good material.

Hard work brings success, while laziness brings failure!

On the evening of September 24, when the Chinese men's basketball team defeated their old rival, South Korea, by 30 points in the final of the Asian Men's Basketball Championship, people were already joyfully seeing the initial results of Sun Bang's coaching philosophy and the hope for the development of the Chinese men's basketball team's technical style.

However, Sun Bang has not eliminated the sense of crisis. He frankly said that the Chinese team's difficult period has not yet passed, and the young players are still immature. He wants to use this year's winter training to further solidify the team's foundation in all aspects, aiming to present a new look at next year's Asian Games.

If a coach and a team can always put themselves in a precarious situation and endure hardships, how can they fail to achieve success?

### 认准的路坚决走下去——访中国男篮主教练孙邦

    认准的路坚决走下去
    ——访中国男篮主教练孙邦
    孙邦，山东济南人士，50有余，相貌平平，身材中等。西装不精致，发型不考究，不善于辞令。但一言既出，便不肯收回。在业务方面，崇尚美国篮球风格，羡慕其选手不仅高大，而且灵活。
    年初，孙邦走马上任，接替中国男篮前主教练钱澄海，成为现任主教练。不久，他公开了自己的治队思想：快、准、灵。别小看这三个字，篮球圈子内部，可炸开了锅。篮球是巨人的运动，大个子占便宜，谁个不知，哪个不晓。中国人在亚洲是大个，比欧、美又是小个。鉴于超过欧、美队还是未来的事，坐稳亚洲第一的宝座，自然是中国男篮的主要目标。钱教练带队时，制定了在亚洲以高制快的方针，正所谓避短扬长，正宗兵法之精髓。其结果是，钱澄海的队，六次获得亚洲男篮锦标赛的冠军。战绩可谓显赫。
    名气声望远在钱澄海之下的孙邦，一上任就变以高制快为以快制快，篮球界能不震动吗？首都体育馆的看台上，孙邦教练向记者谈了他对高快关系这个敏感问题的看法。“美国的篮球队员身材高大，他们的速度也不比中国队慢。中国队在亚洲比别人高，如果再比别人快不是更好吗？”记者哑然。
    孙邦在挑选新的国家队队员时，最中意的就是那些既高大，又能跑的选手，并没有为了挑选能奔善跑的选手，而放弃身高的要求。这就是孙邦的“在高的基础上求快”。“那么请问孙指导，您有什么把握说您的队可以快过南朝鲜这样向来以快制胜的队呢？”“练！”他回答时，似乎连想也没想，也许是早已想过千百次。
    吃得苦中苦，方胜人中人。孙邦在组建新军时，选的就是肯苦练的队员，舍弃的则是训练中吃不得苦的材料——那怕是好材料。
    苦则生，惰则死！苦则胜，惰则败！
    9月24日晚，当中国男篮在亚洲男篮锦标赛决赛中，以30分的大优势打败老对手南朝鲜队时，人们已欣喜地看到孙邦带队指导思想的初步成果，同时也看到中国男篮技术风格发展的希望。
    然而，孙邦并未消除危机感。他坦言说，中国队的困难时期尚未度过，年轻队员还不成熟。他想通过今年冬训把这支队伍的各方面基础再打扎实些，以在明年的亚运会上有新面貌。
    一个教练、一支球队，如果能常常把自己处于临渊之境，卧薪尝胆，何愁得不到收获呢？新华社记者　曲北林　本报记者　陈昭
