Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 23rd.

After more than half a year of intense and meticulous work, all preparations for the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Award Conference are now complete.

The secretary of the conference preparatory committee office and vice-secretary of the State Council, An Chengxin, announced today at a press conference held at the Dayatan Hotel that the award conference will be grandly inaugurated in Beijing on September 28th. The conference will also organize all labor models and advanced workers to participate in the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. We welcome journalists from news agencies of various countries to cover and report on the conference.

This award conference is the largest gathering of heroes in terms of scale and scope in the 30 years since 1959. Among the individuals who will be awarded the honorable title by the State Council, there are 1,988 national labor models and 805 advanced workers. They come from 51 systems or industries, including industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, education, scientific research, and public security. A common characteristic of the model figures selected this time is their high level of political awareness and excellent political qualities. The spirit of hard work, selfless dedication, and pioneering innovation they embody is worthy of emulation and promotion by all ethnic groups in the nation.

Attending this award conference will also be 190 heroic representatives from the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police, as well as 71 representatives of old national labor models who have previously been awarded the honorable title of national labor model. They will attend the conference as special invited representatives.
