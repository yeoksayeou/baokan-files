Students from Hunan Province's Liuyang County, who were trained by the National University of Defense Technology, conducted comprehensive surveys and research on Liuyang with the assistance of university professors and lecturers. They applied the systems engineering theory they had learned to write an approximately 800,000-word report, establishing over 100 mathematical models. They formulated a long-term development plan for Liuyang's economy, science, technology, and society. After three years of implementation, the county's total output value, profits, and fiscal revenue increased by over 100 million yuan annually, achieving synchronized growth. Similar examples of scientific and technological assistance for the people abound within the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense system.

The policy of reform and opening up has provided the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense with a new arena to showcase their talents. With their robust technical strength and excellent equipment, they have achieved remarkable results in cultivating technical talents, providing business consultations, undertaking key engineering projects, and transferring technological achievements. They have also taken a leading role in the scientific and technological assistance for the people within the military system.

Cultivating Talents Not Wearing Military Uniforms

The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense has adopted various forms to cultivate talents for the country's modernization drive, striving to enhance the scientific and cultural literacy of the entire population. They actively tap into their potential, overcome various difficulties, and adopt forms such as sponsored training, correspondence consultation, open education, and off-campus teaching. They have cultivated nearly 50,000 talents in areas including computer applications, enterprise management, agricultural systems engineering, economics, science, technology, and social planning. These talents are spread across 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, becoming a vital force in the country's modernization drive.

Precision Planning for National Key Projects

The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense also undertakes the design and construction of some key national engineering projects. According to incomplete statistics, over the past decade, they have completed over 400 large and medium-sized projects for the country, involving design, scientific research, surveying, installation, and debugging. The total investment amounts to 120 million yuan, with a construction area of over 670,000 square meters. In the planning, design, and construction process, they not only ensure quality and reputation but also pay attention to meticulous planning, sparing no effort to save the country's limited funds. After taking on the design task for the large-scale mechanized stage equipment of the Central Opera House, the Engineering Design Institute of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense conducted thorough research and design, and implemented scientific and reasonable construction. They not only completed the construction task on time and to the required standard but also reduced the equipment processing cost by 45%, saving an investment of 3.62 million yuan.

Technology Transfer — Benefits for the People

Transferring national defense scientific research achievements to civilian use, benefiting and serving the people, has been an important aspect of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense's support for the country's modernization drive in recent years. They have completed over 1,100 technology transfers, supporting over 600 local small and medium-sized enterprises, bringing direct economic benefits to the country. Due to the temporary inability to produce toner domestically, the country had to spend a large amount of foreign exchange to import it annually. The scientific and technological personnel of the 201st unit of a certain base of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense conducted repeated experiments and overcame difficulties to successfully develop the key equipment for manufacturing this toner, the ultra-fine pulverizer. The Yabuli Pharmaceutical Factory in Heilongjiang Province had been incurring losses year after year due to the lack of a flagship product. The Aerospace Medical Engineering Research Institute of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense transferred the production technology of the newly developed drug "Weidakang" for preventing and treating microwave radiation to them, helping the factory reverse its losses and achieve significant growth in production value and profits, becoming an advanced unit in the pharmaceutical system of Heilongjiang Province.

Opening Windows to the World in Coastal Areas

The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense also sincerely serves the country's coastal economic development strategy. Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, experts and technical personnel from the Commission have gone to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fuzhou, Changzhou, and other places to investigate the development of labor-intensive industries and technical development in the export-oriented economy. They have opened windows for external technical services and have already signed a number of contracts.

In May of last year, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense organized 134 national defense science and technology industry professional information networks to hold a military technology transfer to civilian use information release meeting in Guangzhou. They announced the transfer of 1,082 technological achievements to civilian use, immediately signing over 140 contracts and agreements.

    驰骋在广阔的大地
    ——国防科工委开展科技助民活动
    张炳起　薛舜尧
    国防科技大学代培的湖南省浏阳县的学员们在大学教授、讲师的协助下，运用所学的系统工程理论对浏阳作了全面的调查研究，写出了约80万字的报告，建立了100多个数学模型，制订出了浏阳经济、科技、社会发展的长远规划，经过3年实施，每年递增上亿元，实现了全县产值、利润、财政收入同步增长。在国防科工委系统，类似的科技助民事例举不胜举。
    改革开放的政策给国防科工委提供了一块施展才华的新领域，雄厚的技术力量和精良的装备使他们在培养技术人才、开展业务咨询、承担重点工程项目、转让技术成果等方面取得了可喜的成绩，并在军队系统的科技助民活动中占了明显优势。
    培养不穿军装的人才
    国防科工委采取多种形式为国家四化建设培养人才，为提高全民的科学文化素质尽心尽力。他们积极挖掘潜力，努力克服种种困难，采取代培代训、刊授咨询、开门办学、出门授课等形式，为国家培养了包括计算机应用、企业管理、农业系统工程、经济、科技、社会规划等方面的人才近50000名。这些人才遍布全国29个省、市、自治区，成为国家四化建设的一支生力军。
    为国家重点工程精打细算
    国防科工委还承担着国家一些重点工程项目的设计与施工。据不完全统计，近10年间，他们先后为国家完成工程设计、科研勘测、安装调试的大中型项目达400多项，投资总额1.2亿元，建筑面积67万多平方米。在规划设计施工中，他们不仅确保信誉、保质保量，而且注意精打细算，千方百计为国家节约有限的资金。国防科工委工程设计所承担了中央歌剧院大型机械化舞台设备的设计任务后，认真调研设计，科学合理施工，不仅保质保量完成了施工任务，而且降低设备加工造价45％，节省投资362万元。
    技术转让　让利于民
    将国防科研技术成果转移民用，让利于民，造福于民，是国防科工委近几年支援国家四化建设的一个重要方面。他们共完成各种技术转让1100多项，扶持地方中小企业600多个，给国家带来了直接的经济效益。复印机墨粉由于国内一时不能生产，国家每年要花大量外汇进口。国防科工委某基地201室的科技人员反复试验刻苦攻关，研制成功制造这种墨粉的关键设备超微粉碎机。黑龙江一面坡制药厂曾因缺乏拳头产品而连年亏损，国防科工委航天医学工程研究所把研制成功的防治微波辐射新药“维达康”的生产技术转让给他们，使该厂一举扭转亏损局面，年产值和利润成倍增长，成为黑龙江省制药系统的先进单位。
    到沿海敞开通向世界之窗
    国防科工委还竭诚为国家沿海经济发展战略服务。改革开放的方针实施以来，国防科工委一些专家、技术人员深入到广州、深圳、福州、常州等地，考察发展劳动密集型产业和外向型经济中的技术开发工作，开辟对外技术服务窗口，并已签订了一批合同。
      去年5月，国防科工委还组织134个国防科技工业专业情报网站，在广州举办了军工技术转民用信息发布会，宣布1082项技术成果向民用转移，当即签订合同、协议书140多份。
