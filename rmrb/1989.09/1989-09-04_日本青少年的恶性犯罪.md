Residents of the bustling city of Tokyo are increasingly feeling that their safety is not guaranteed. Newspapers and television almost daily report cases of murder. Just in the first half of this year, there have been several serious incidents: a 5-year-old girl went missing for five days before her body was found in a cemetery in another city; a group of youths kidnapped a young woman, raped her, and then killed her, stuffing her body into a barrel filled with cement; a journalist was beaten to death in broad daylight by criminals; two police officers were mysteriously killed...

According to reports, most of the perpetrators of these crimes are young people, whose methods are brutal and whose frequency of crimes is high.

According to police investigations, these serious cases are different from previous ones. They are neither acts of revenge nor crimes motivated by financial gain, and they lack clear motives for murder.

Experts analyze that with the rapid economic development, some young people, although living in affluence and seemingly happy, are spiritually empty. They cannot bear the psychological pressure brought by various social factors, lose confidence in their future, and thus feel a sense of abandonment and despair. Moreover, the lifestyle of big cities makes each family relatively independent, with everyone struggling for their own goals, lacking emotional exchange, and interpersonal relationships becoming increasingly cold. This makes it even harder for those young people who are trapped in loneliness and boredom to extricate themselves. Although they can find temporary spiritual comfort and psychological balance from television, they actually strongly feel the cruelty of reality, even leading to a complete mental collapse. Psychologist Kyoji Asakura says: "In a sense, they are almost living in a vacuum." This statement is not without reason.

The rise in crime rates in cities, especially the sharp increase in serious cases, has become a social problem faced by many developed countries.

    日本青少年的恶性犯罪
    生活在繁华城市东京的居民，越来越感到安全没有保障。报纸和电视几乎每天都报道凶杀案。仅今年上半年发生的恶性案件就有：一个5岁女孩失踪5天后，才在外地的一块墓地找到她的尸体；一伙少年绑架了一名少女，将其奸污后杀死，把尸体塞进灌满水泥的桶内；一名记者在光天化日之下被歹徒活活打死；两名警察莫名其妙被害……
　据报道，此类作案者大多是青年，他们的手段残忍，犯案次数频繁。
    据警方调查，这些恶性案件与以往的有所不同，既不是报复行为，也不是谋财害命，缺乏明确的杀人动机。
    专家们分析，随着经济的高速发展，有些青年人虽过着富裕的生活，表面上很幸福，但精神空虚，承受不了社会诸多因素给其心理上造成的压力，对前途丧失信心，从而产生了被社会遗弃的孤独感和厌世情绪。另外，大都市的生活方式使得每个家庭相对独立，人人都为各自的目的拚命奋斗，彼此缺乏情感上的交流，人际关系日渐冷漠。这就使那些陷于孤独、寂寞中的青年更难以自拔。他们虽然能从电视中寻求暂时的精神安慰和心理平衡，可实际上却强烈地感受着现实的冷酷无情，甚至导致精神的总崩溃。犯罪心理学家浅仓京次说：“从某种意义上说，他们几乎生活在真空中。”这话不无道理。
    城市犯罪率上升，尤其恶性案件的剧增，已成为许多发达国家面临的社会问题。
