The Soviet Union's Pravda newspaper has launched a counterattack against Western media reports on the situation in the three Baltic republics, accusing certain Western forces of attempting to dismantle the Soviet federal system and thereby disrupting European stability.

An article published on September 12 by political observer Korionov in Pravda points out that various Western organizations and centers are actively involved in advising nationalist and separatist groups in the region. American diplomats, under the guise of consular duties, frequently appear in the Soviet Baltic region. Historical experience shows that separatist movements often make national interests a sacrifice for external forces to implement their policies.

Pravda's article warns that the unrest stirred up by nationalist and separatist elements in the Soviet Baltic region not only threatens to undermine the Soviet state system and sabotage Soviet reforms but also affects the easing of international tensions. In today's interdependent world, the stability of each country, especially a large country like the Soviet Union, is an important factor in global stability. The newspaper clearly states that if actions that shake the social foundations within the Soviet Union continue to increase, the Soviet people will not remain indifferent.

Recently, the three Baltic republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—took the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact as an opportunity to hold large-scale demonstrations, with some extremists calling for "secession from the Soviet Union." On August 26, the CPSU Central Committee issued a statement expressing serious concern about the situation in these regions. Since then, Western media have extensively reported on the situation in the Soviet Baltic region. Pravda's article is an authoritative response to the Western media's distorted reports.

　　苏联《真理报》发表文章
　　指责西方妄图使苏联邦制解体
    新华社莫斯科9月12日电　苏联《真理报》反击西方报刊对波罗的海沿岸3个加盟共和国局势的渲染，指责一些西方势力妄图使苏维埃联邦制解体，进而破坏欧洲的稳定。
    该报12日发表的由政治观察家科里奥诺夫撰写的文章指出，西方形形色色的组织和中心正积极开展活动，给那里的民族主义和分立主义集团出谋划策；美国外交官则以处理
  “领事”业务为由，经常出现在苏联波罗的海地区。历史经验证明，分立主义运动往往会使民族利益成为外部势力推行其政策的牺牲品。
    《真理报》的文章警告说，苏联波罗的海地区民族主义和分立主义分子掀起的这场叫嚣，不仅会动摇苏联的国家制度和破坏苏联的改革，而且会影响到国际形势的缓和。因为在当今这个互相依存的世界上，每个国家，尤其是苏联这样一个大国的稳定，是国际社会稳定的重要因素。该报明确表示，如果苏联国内出现的动摇社会基础的行动有增无减，苏联人民决不会置若罔闻。
    前不久，苏联波罗的海沿岸3个共和国——爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛借苏德互不侵犯条约签订50周年之机，举行大规模示威游行，一些极端分子提出“脱离苏联”等口号。8月26日，苏共中央发表声明，对上述地区的形势表示严重不安。从那以后，西方报刊对苏联波罗的海沿岸的局势作了大量报道，《真理报》的这篇文章即是对西方歪曲报道所作的权威性反应。
