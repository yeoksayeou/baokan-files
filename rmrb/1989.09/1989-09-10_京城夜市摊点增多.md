Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 10th.

Nighttime in Beijing has traditionally seen individual vendors doing business, but in recent days, to welcome the National Day, state-owned stores have also set up stalls outside their shops along the streets, engaging in street-side trading.

Shops use nearby trees as supports, stringing up electric wires adorned with red and green ribbons, and lighting them up. Some even hang large red lanterns, making the area visible from afar with a bright and lively atmosphere. The streets are much more bustling than usual, with people coming and going.

The range of night market vendors is quite broad: from food stores to vegetable markets, restaurants, department stores, and even post offices selling commemorative stamps and postcards. Some science and technology stores set up computers outdoors to calculate "biorhythms" for passersby. Stalls selling Asian Games lottery tickets attract even more crowds.

　　京城夜市摊点增多
    据新华社北京九月十日电　（记者吴锦才）夜晚的北京，做生意的一直以个体户为主，但近几天为了迎接国庆，国营商店也纷纷在店外马路边上摆出小摊，做起了街头生意。
    店家以门外树木为柱，牵扯起挂着红绿丝带的电线，亮起灯来，有的还悬起一个个大红灯笼，让人远远地看见夜色之下一片灯火通明。人们熙熙攘攘地过来过去，街两边较往常热闹许多。
    这种夜市的业主包括的范围很大：从食品店到菜市场、饭馆、百货商店，甚至连邮局也摆出摊子卖纪念邮票和明信片。有的科技门市部则弄台电脑露天给人计算“生物节律”。卖亚运会奖券的摊子聚集起的人还要更多一些。
