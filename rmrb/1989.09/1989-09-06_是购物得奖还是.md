	Is it winning a prize by shopping or...
	Tian Tian
	Qianmen, one of Beijing's bustling commercial districts. Recently, Dongsheng Shoe Store and Buyunxiang Shoe Store jointly held a prize-winning sales event. The event lasted for ten days. The first prize was one: a brand-name suitcase; the second prize was three: a work of art with a carved shell frame; ... commemorative prize: a pair of insoles or a bar of soap. Customers who purchased goods worth fifty yuan could receive one lottery ticket to participate in the drawing.

	Entering the "jurisdiction" of these two shoe stores, various sensory stimuli came one after another. "Come on! Try your luck." The sign at the entrance of Buyunxiang Shoe Store was eye-catching. Inside the store, slogans like "Good fortune comes to those with a pure heart, luck is just around the corner," "Prize-winning shopping, don't miss the opportunity" were everywhere. Dongsheng Shoe Store was even more direct: "Luck has come, why not spend fifty yuan," "As long as you are willing to spend fifty yuan, you are guaranteed to win a prize" ...

	Prize-winning sales are indeed a legitimate promotional method, but if customers entering the store feel like they are in a casino, it not only damages the nature of commercial operations but also greatly distorts the hearts and emotions of the general public. The result, whether the store makes money or the shopper gets lucky, is worth considering. Look at the following scene:

	In Dongsheng Shoe Store, the author saw a middle-aged man holding his "prize" (a pair of shoes) to exchange it, saying it was too big and he couldn't wear it. The store's duty manager and two staff members in charge of issuing prize tickets insisted on not exchanging it, saying: because you won the prize, the rules clearly state: all prize-winning items, in principle, are not exchangeable.

	This customer won the prize. Was he lucky or did he consider himself unlucky?

    是购物得奖还是……
    天添
    前门，北京的闹市区之一。前不久，东升鞋店与步瀛斋鞋店联合举办有奖销售。为期十天。一等奖一名：名牌旅行箱一件；二等奖三名：工艺贝雕画框一幅；……纪念奖：鞋垫或香皂一双（块）。凡购买五十元商品即可得奖券一张，参加摸奖。
    走入这两家鞋店的“辖区”，各种感官刺激不断传来。“来呀！碰碰您的运气”。步瀛斋鞋店楼梯口的标语赫然在目。店堂内，“福至心灵，运气即来”、“有奖购物，莫失良机”等招唤，比比皆是。东升鞋店里则更为直接了当：“运气来了，为何不花五十元”，“只要肯花五十元，保您中奖”……
    有奖销售本来是无可厚非的促销手段，然而，若是使顾客步入店堂就像进了赌场一样，不仅有损商业经营的性质，而且对广大顾客的心灵和感情也是极大的扭曲。其结果，究竟是店家发财，还是购物者走运呢？请看下面的一幕：
    在东升鞋店，笔者看到一位中年男子抱着“奖品”
  （一双鞋）来退换，说是大了，穿不了。鞋店值班经理及两位负责发奖券的同志坚持不换，说：因为你中奖了，注意事项中明文规定：凡中奖商品，原则上不退换。
    这位顾客中奖了，他是交了好运还是自认倒霉呢？
