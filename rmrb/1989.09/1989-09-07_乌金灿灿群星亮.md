The majestic Helan Mountain stands like a galloping steed on the western side of the Yinchuan Plain. It symbolizes the heroic strides of the Ningxia Hui and Han peoples as they advance on the socialist path. Rich in coal resources, it is a tremendous material wealth driving the economic development of Ningxia.

At night, the mining points scattered along the eastern foothills of Helan Mountain light up with countless lamps; from afar, they resemble strings of pearls forming a "Milky Way." This vivid scene demonstrates that Ningxia is one of China's important energy bases.

Ningxia's coal-bearing strata are widely distributed, with coal deposits found almost throughout the region. The coal-bearing area covers 12,000 square kilometers, with proven reserves of 30.8 billion tons. The coal is shallowly buried, has a simple geological structure, and is easy to mine. Moreover, the coal varieties are complete, and the quality is excellent.

Over the past 40 years, Ningxia's coal industry has developed rapidly. In the early days of liberation, the region had only a few small, primitive coal mines with an annual production capacity of just over 20,000 tons. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region in 1958, under the unified planning of the state, four major mining areas—Shitanjing, Shizuishan, Rujugou, and Hulustai—were developed, and nine large and medium-sized mines were built. The winds of reform have injected new vitality into the coal industry in Ningxia. Currently, the region's annual coal production capacity has reached over 12 million tons.

Among the developed mining areas, the coal from the Shizuishan mining area is high-quality bituminous coal; the Shitanjing mining area is the only coking coal base in the northwest region. The main coking coal produced here, after being washed and selected at the Dawukou Coal Washing Plant, is mainly supplied to the metallurgical industries in Jiuquan, Baotou, and the region itself. The high-quality anthracite produced in the Rujugou mining area is a rare treasure, known for its low ash, low sulfur, low phosphorus, high calorific value, high resistivity, and high chemical activity. It is exported to Belgium, France, Japan, and Southeast Asia, among other places, and is a key export product of the Coal Industry Department, earning it the reputation of "Tai Xi Black Gold" from foreign merchants.

In 1988, the total industrial output value of Ningxia's coal industry reached 513 million yuan, accounting for 15% of the region's total industrial output value; coal exports earned 31.59 million US dollars in foreign exchange, accounting for 39.4% of the region's total export earnings. These figures indicate that coal production plays a crucial role in Ningxia's economic development.

With coal comes electricity. Ningxia has successively built the Zhongning, Shizuishan, and Dawukou thermal power plants, along with the Qingtongxia hydropower plant, with a total installed capacity of over 900,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 4.9 billion kilowatt-hours. The per capita power generation in Ningxia ranks among the highest in the country. Four 300,000-kilowatt generator units of the Daban thermal power plant are under construction. Many people exclaim, "Ningxia is a rich energy tycoon."

With coal as the foundation and electricity as the leading force, Ningxia aims to drive the overall development of industry. According to this concept, while focusing on coal deep processing, Ningxia is also appropriately developing high-energy-consuming industries. Currently, Ningxia has more than ten coal initial processing and deep processing enterprises, including washed coal, shaped coal, coking, activated carbon, and carbon products. The Shizuishan Carbon Products Plant has produced seven products, including carbon blocks, electrode paste, and carbon filters, which are used in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Among them, carbon filters have been exported in small batches. A coking plant with an annual capacity of 10 million tons, funded by the Coal Industry Department, is under construction. A 30,000-ton carbon products plant, funded by the Metallurgical Industry Department, has started construction. Under the unified planning of the Autonomous Region, more coal conversion plants will appear on the land of Ningxia. To fully leverage the energy advantages, Ningxia has successively built high-energy-consuming enterprises such as steelmaking, ironmaking, electrolytic aluminum, calcium carbide, and nitrogen fertilizer. In particular, the production of ferroalloys has developed rapidly. Currently, the region has a total furnace capacity of over 70,000 kilovolt-amperes for silicon iron and ferrosilicon, with an annual production capacity of over 50,000 tons, becoming a pillar of the metallurgical industry. Ningxia's ferrosilicon is also popular in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western Europe, contributing to foreign trade exports and earning foreign exchange.

The development of the coal and electricity industries has brought vigorous vitality to Ningxia's economic development. Currently, the region has formed a relatively large industrial system with coal, electricity, machinery, metallurgy, chemicals, and wool textiles as its main features. Truly, "The shining stars of coal."

    乌金灿灿群星亮
    巍峨的贺兰山，犹如一匹奔驰的骏马，坐落在银川平原的西侧。它象征着宁夏回汉各族儿女在社会主义大道上奋勇前进的雄姿。这里蕴藏丰富的煤炭资源，是推动宁夏经济发展的巨大物质财富。
    入夜，贺兰山东麓星罗棋布的矿点，亮起万盏灯火；远远望去，像串串珍珠汇集成的“银河”。它以形象生动的事实向人们展示：宁夏是我国重要的能源基地之一。
    宁夏含煤地层分布广泛，煤的蕴藏几乎遍及全区，含煤层面积达1.2万平方公里，已探明储量为308亿吨，埋藏浅，地质结构简单，易于开采，而且煤的品种齐全，煤质优良。
    40年来，宁夏煤炭工业获得了迅速发展。解放初期，全区只有几处简陋的小型煤矿，年生产能力仅2万多吨。1958年自治区成立后，在国家统一规划下，先后开发了石炭井、石嘴山、汝箕沟、呼鲁斯太4大矿区，建成大中型矿井9处。改革的春风，给宁夏煤炭系统各企业注入了新的活力。目前，全区煤炭年生产能力已达1200多万吨。
    在已建成的矿区中，石嘴山矿区的煤是优质动力煤；石炭井矿区是西北地区唯一的炼焦煤基地，生产的主焦煤经大武口洗煤厂洗选后，主要供应酒泉、包头和本区冶炼用；汝箕沟矿区出产的优质无烟煤更是稀世珍宝，具有低灰、低硫、低磷、高发热量、高比电阻、高化学活性等特点，远销比利时、法国、日本、东南亚等地，成为煤炭部重点出口产品，被外商誉为“太西乌金”。
    1988年，宁夏煤炭工业总产值达5.13亿元，占全区工业总产值15％；煤炭出口创汇3159万美元，占全区出口创汇额的39.4％。大量的数字说明，煤炭生产在宁夏经济发展中具有举足轻重的地位。
    有煤，就有了电。宁夏已先后建成中宁、石嘴山、大武口火力发电厂，再加上青铜峡水电厂，总装机容量90多万千瓦，年发电量49亿千瓦时，人均发电量在全国位居前列。4台每台为30万千瓦机组的大坝火电厂正在建设中。不少人赞叹：“宁夏是能源的富翁。”
    以煤炭为依托，以电力为龙头，带动工业全面发展。宁夏根据这个构想，一方面在煤炭深加工上做文章，一方面适当地发展高耗能工业。现在宁夏已拥有洗精煤、型煤、焦化、活性炭、碳素等十多家煤炭初加工和深加工企业。石嘴山碳素厂已生产出碳块、电极糊、碳素过滤剂等7种产品，供全国22个省、市、自治区使用，其中碳素过滤剂已小批量出口。由煤炭部拨款的年产10万吨的锻料厂正在筹建。由冶金部投资的3万吨碳素厂已开工建设。在自治区的统一规划下，更多的煤炭转化工厂将出现在宁夏的大地上。为了充分发挥能源优势，宁夏先后建成了炼钢、炼铁、电解铝、电石、氮肥等高耗能企业。特别是铁合金生产迅速发展，目前，全区拥有硅铁矿热电炉总容量7万多千伏安，年生产能力5万多吨，成为冶金工业发展的支柱力量。宁夏生产的硅铁还畅销日本、东南亚、西欧等国家和地区，为外贸出口创汇作出贡献。
    煤、电工业的发展，给宁夏经济发展带来勃勃生机。目前，全区已形成了一个具有相当规模的以煤炭、电力、机械、冶金、化工和毛纺织业为主要特色的工业体系。真可谓：“乌金灿灿群星亮。”
