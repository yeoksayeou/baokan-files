Cairo Frequently Blows the Wind of Dialogue

By Lin Jiaoming

The PLO Executive Committee Chairman Arafat has visited Cairo several times in recent weeks. Israeli Defense Minister Rabin, with the approval of the Israeli Cabinet, also arrived on the 18th to meet with Mubarak. Egyptian Foreign Minister Abu al-Gheit made a lightning visit to Jordan, and Foreign Minister Maajid summoned ambassadors from various Arab countries to brief them. There are also many mysterious messages: prominent figures from the Palestinian occupied territories are already in Cairo. Cairo has recently become the center of Middle East diplomatic activities.

This is a significant diplomatic whirlwind, highlighting a prominent theme: direct dialogue between the Palestinian delegation and the Israeli delegation.

The source of this wind comes from the "10-point election plan" officially proposed by the Egyptian government on September 10, aimed at breaking the stalemate in Middle East peace talks. President Mubarak clarified yesterday that the "10-point plan" is merely a clarification of the Israeli Shamir election plan and does not constitute a complete initiative. This plan was proposed as early as July this year, conveyed to Israel by American legislators, and requires a positive response. Various diplomatic contacts have made its core clear: Egypt is trying to facilitate direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo.

Obviously, this is Egypt's painstaking attempt to narrow the gap between the Palestinians and Israelis through compromise and reconciliation.

Many people have carefully compared the Egyptian plan with the Shamir plan. The conclusion is that the Shamir plan is "close to death" and "difficult to become the basis for Palestinian dialogue." The Egyptian plan, on the other hand, "has flexibility," and if it receives a response from Israel, it has a good chance of success. This cannot help but attract the attention of the international community.

The compromise nature of the Egyptian plan is evident. It does not explicitly propose the legal representative status of the PLO, does not involve an international conference on Middle East peace, and only mentions the temporary withdrawal of Israeli troops from the election areas, changing UN supervision to general international supervision. This is clearly considering the possible acceptance range and degree of the Israeli authorities. At the same time, it insists on holding elections based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, adhering to the principle of "land for peace," stopping the Jewish settlement plan, and, in particular, it firmly demands that Palestinian representatives outside the occupied territories participate in the dialogue delegation and that East Jerusalem Palestinians have the right to vote. This to a large extent aligns with the established position of the PLO.

The whirlwind blew into the Israeli cabinet, causing a stir. Westerners say that the Israeli cabinet's agreement for Rabin to visit Egypt indicates a "softening of stance." This statement seems premature. More accurately, this wind has lifted the veil of the Israeli cabinet, exposing its internal rifts. The Likud faction led by Shamir opposes both the Egyptian plan and the key issue of external representatives participating in the delegation and East Jerusalem Palestinians participating in the elections. Labor Party members Rabin and Peres, however, believe that the Egyptian plan can serve as a "basis for dialogue." The two factions are arguing, and it seems difficult for them to form a unified stance on the Egyptian plan.

Nevertheless, Defense Minister Rabin's visit to Cairo "on behalf of the Israeli cabinet," publicly agreeing and willing to plan direct negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations, is a noteworthy new development. It is undoubtedly one of the results of the 22-month struggle of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the influence of the Arab camp's peace offensive. Of course, there may also be some actions by the United States behind this.

The Middle East conflict has lasted 40 years, and war does not solve problems, while stalemate is not in the interest of both the Arabs and Israelis. This has become an international consensus. Direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis, like the ongoing Palestinian-American dialogue, has its positive significance as a preparation for the final resolution of the Middle East peace conference. The Egyptian government is seeking the greatest possible common ground for dialogue that both sides can accept between the Palestinians and Israelis and is working to facilitate direct dialogue. People generally hope that there will be some results. Although the Israeli authorities currently cannot form a unified stance, and the PLO will also express its opinions in further consultations with the Egyptian government, as long as direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis can be realized, it will give a new impetus to the Middle East peace process and will naturally be welcomed by the international community.

### 开罗频吹对话风

    开罗频吹对话风
    本报记者　林皎明
    巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特几周内数次飞抵开罗，以色列国防部长拉宾18日领了“内阁许可证”，也来见穆巴拉克；埃及外交关键人物巴兹闪电出访约旦；马吉德外长召集阿拉伯各国大使吹风；还有多少带点神秘色彩的消息：巴勒斯坦被占领土的著名人士已在开罗。开罗近来已成为中东外交活动的中心。
    这是一股势头不小的外交旋风，烘托着一个日渐突出的主题：巴勒斯坦代表团与以色列代表团的直接对话。
    风源来自9月10日埃及政府正式提出的旨在打破中东和谈僵局的“选举10点计划”。穆巴拉克总统昨天修正新闻界的用词，明确说明“10点计划”只是对以色列沙米尔选举计划的“澄清”，并不构成完整的主动行动。这个计划早在今年7月份就提出，由美国议员转达给以色列，要求得到积极答复。多方外交接触把它的核心明白显露出来：埃及力图在开罗促成巴以直接对话。
    显然，这是埃及苦心缩小巴以双方距离的折衷调和尝试。
    许多人细心地将埃及计划与沙米尔计划加以比较。结论是，沙米尔计划“接近死亡”，“很难成为巴勒斯坦人全盘接受的对话基础”。而埃及计划“具有灵活性”，如果得到以色列的响应，颇有成功的希望。这不能不引起国际社会的关注。
    埃及方案的折衷色彩是显而易见的。它不明确提出巴解组织的合法代表权，不涉及中东和平国际会议，只提以色列军队从选举区暂时撤出，将联合国监督改成泛指的国际监督。这明显是考虑到以色列当局可能接受的范围和程度。同时，它又坚持选举要以安理会242、338号决议为基础，信守“以土地换取和平”的原则，停止犹太人定居点计划，尤其是，它坚决要求被占领土以外的巴勒斯坦代表参加对话代表团、东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦人有权参选。这又在很大程度上与巴解组织的既定立场吻合。
    旋风吹进以色列内阁，引起一阵骚动。西方人士说，以色列内阁同意拉宾出访埃及，表明立场“有所软化”。这话似乎说得太早。确切地说，这阵风揭去了以色列内阁的面纱，暴露出其内部的裂痕。沙米尔为首的利库德一派，既反对埃及计划，更反对关键的外部代表参加组团和东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦人参加选举。工党的拉宾和佩雷斯则认为埃及计划可作为“对话基础”。两派就此吵吵嚷嚷，看来很难形成对埃及计划的统一立场。
    尽管如此，拉宾国防部长“代表以色列内阁”造访开罗，大庭广众之下赞同和愿意筹划以巴代表团直接谈判，却是值得注意的新动向。它无疑是被占领土巴勒斯坦人民坚持22个月斗争的结果之一，是阿拉伯阵营和平攻势的影响所至。当然，其背后恐怕也难保没有美国的某些动作。
    中东争端40年，战争不解决问题，僵持不利于阿以双方。这已有国际公论。巴以直接对话，如同业已开始的巴美对话，作为最终解决中东和会的准备，是有其积极意义的。埃及政府在巴以之间最大程度地寻求双方均可接受的对话基础，努力促成直接对话，人们总希望会有些成果。尽管以色列当局目前还形不成一个统一的立场；巴解组织也会在与埃及政府的磋商中进一步表达自己的意见，但只要巴以直接对话真能实现，它会给中东和平进程以新的推动，自然也会受到国际社会的欢迎。
