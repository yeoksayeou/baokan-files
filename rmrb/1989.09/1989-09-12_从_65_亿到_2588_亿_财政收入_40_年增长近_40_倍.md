According to the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 12 (Reporter Ding Jianming), according to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's national fiscal revenue increased from 650 million yuan in 1950 to 25.88 billion yuan in 1988, nearly 40 times the original amount, with an average annual growth rate of 10.20%.

Over the past 40 years, China's fiscal policy has adhered to the principle of self-reliance, with the growth of fiscal revenue primarily based on the development of the domestic economy. Statistics show that from 1950 to 1988, the cumulative domestic fiscal revenue was 298.68 billion yuan, accounting for about 98% of the total fiscal revenue. In particular, since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, national income and state fiscal revenue have seen significant growth. In the decade of reform and opening up, the cumulative state fiscal revenue was over 162 billion yuan, surpassing the total state fiscal revenue of the previous 30 years since the founding of the People's Republic.

Over the past 40 years, the state's fiscal expenditure on economic construction has reached over 160 billion yuan, accounting for more than 50% of the total fiscal expenditure. Among these, the state's fiscal expenditure on basic construction projects has reached over 100 billion yuan, completing over 5,500 key large and medium-sized projects, including Anshan Steel, Wuhan Steel, Capital Steel, First Automobile Works, Second Automobile Works, First Heavy Machinery Works, Second Heavy Machinery Works, and the Gezhouba Hydropower Project.

Over the past 40 years, the state has also allocated over 40 billion yuan in fiscal support for the development of science, education, culture, and health. In particular, since 1979, the state's fiscal expenditure on science, education, culture, and health has been growing at an average annual rate of 15.6%.

    40年来，国家财政用于经济建设方面的支出达16000多亿元，占全部财政支出的50％以上。其中国家财政用于基本建设的支出就达10000多亿元，先后建设成了鞍钢、武钢、首钢、一汽、二汽、一重、二重及葛洲坝水利枢纽工程等5500多个大中型骨干项目。
