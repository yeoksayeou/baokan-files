The State Council held its 47th executive meeting yesterday, reviewing and approving the "Draft Amendment to the Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China." Premier Li Peng presided over the meeting.

The meeting noted that the "Provisional Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China," which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress in 1979, has played a certain role in strengthening environmental protection in China, reducing pollution and environmental damage. However, it was found during implementation that the "Provisional Environmental Protection Law" has some inadequacies, and some of its contents are no longer in line with the current situation. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the experience and make appropriate amendments and improvements to the "Provisional Environmental Protection Law" as a formal law to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

The meeting also reviewed and approved the "Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Noise Pollution of the People's Republic of China." These regulations will be promulgated and enforced by the State Council.

Eight members of the State Council's executive meeting attended today's meeting, while six were absent due to leave.

    国务院昨天举行常务会议  通过环境保护法修改草案
    同时通过环境噪声污染防治条例
    新华社北京9月1日电　国务院今天举行第47次常务会议，审议并通过了《中华人民共和国环境保护法（修改草案）》。李鹏总理主持了会议。
    会议认为，《中华人民共和国环境保护法
  （试行）》自1979年经五届全国人大常务委员会公布试行以来，对加强我国的环境保护工作，减少环境污染和环境破坏起到了一定作用。但是，在执行中也发现《环境保护法（试行）》有不够完善的地方，有些内容也已不适应当前形势发展的需要。因此，有必要在总结经验的基础上，对《环境保护法（试行）》加以修改完善，作为正式法律提请全国人大常务委员会审议。
    今天的会议还审议通过了《中华人民共和国环境噪声污染防治条例》。这个条例将由国务院公布施行。
    出席今天会议的国务院常务会议成员8人，请假的6人。
