Title: A Distant Tribute of Sorrow – In Memory of Shu Qu

In a distant foreign land, I suddenly read in the August 4th edition of the People's Daily that Comrade Shu Qu passed away on August 2nd. Although it was not entirely unexpected, it still brought great sorrow. Memories of him have been lingering in my heart day and night, and I regret not being able to bid him a final farewell. So, I will express my sorrow through this short article!

Comrade Shu Qu was a bit of an eccentric, taciturn, and not very sociable. He was also not one to go with the flow or curry favor. Initially, he might give off an impression of being difficult to approach. But after spending more time with him, one would feel that he had a kind heart, was straightforward and honest, sincere and warm towards comrades, and handled issues objectively and fairly. He was loyal to the revolutionary cause, fearless in the face of danger, and unyielding. No matter how difficult the circumstances, he always stood by his principles and never shifted with the wind or compromised.

I first met Comrade Shu Qu in 1951 when he was transferred to the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles (later the Chinese Writers' Association) to serve as the secretary-general. At that time, I was the party branch secretary of the organization. Soon after he arrived, the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns began. We worked together on these campaigns, spending day and night (often until one or two in the morning) closely together, until I left for a visit to North Korea in the spring of 1952.

When Shu Qu first arrived at the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he wore a pair of wide-legged khaki trousers and had a dark, square face with bright, shining black eyes. At first glance, he looked like a worker or peasant cadre. His movements were slow and deliberate, always seeming to be deep in thought, pacing back and forth under the corridor of the main building.

Shu Qu was an old writer and a revolutionary veteran. As early as 1932, he joined the Communist Party of China and worked for the Third International's Chinese branch. Three days after the "September 18th Incident," he participated in the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Harbin. In 1935, he joined the Left-Wing Writers' League in Shanghai and gained fame with his revolutionary novel "Children Without a Homeland," which shocked the literary circles of Shanghai. Surprisingly, he had no airs of an "official," "big shot," or "academic authority." When discussing work with everyone, he always listened to others' opinions first. Even when speaking to a staff member, he would use a consultative tone: "Comrade XXX, could you please do something for me?" When he heard that a staff member's family was in trouble, he would generously give them money from his own savings to help their family, just like a friend would.

Due to years of hardship and imprisonment, Comrade Shu Qu's health had been severely damaged. At that time, he suffered from a serious stomach illness. Every time he worked or attended meetings late into the night, he would press his stomach and endure until the "Three Anti" campaign ended before he finally went to the hospital for surgery. Unfortunately, the doctor was careless and left a piece of gauze in his abdomen. It took a long time to discover the cause and undergo a second surgery. After that, his health deteriorated even further.

The "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns played a good role in combating corruption, waste, and changing bad habits, but at that time, extreme leftist methods had already emerged. Instead of seeking truth from facts, they set quotas for "hunting tigers," causing many comrades to suffer injustices. Comrade Shu Qu was strict with himself and made several public self-criticisms, deeply remorseful, and several times apologized tearfully to those who had been wronged. Many years later, he still felt heavy-hearted and guilty when recalling these events.

However, his good intentions did not bring good results. Starting in 1955, the anti-Hu Feng campaign, and especially the anti-"Ding-Chen" campaign in the literary circles, dragged him into the turmoil. During the Northeast Literary Work Conference in 1950, he and several other attendees expressed some differing opinions and were labeled as the "Lu-Shu-Bai" clique. In 1955, the "materials" were transferred and upgraded to an "anti-party clique," and later entered the major false case of the "Ding-Chen Anti-Party Group." In May 1957, the "Ding-Chen Anti-Party Group" was rectified, and the "Lu-Shu-Bai Anti-Party Clique" was also dismissed. It was then that I understood why Shu Qu was always so taciturn and deep in thought. After these twists and turns, his already gloomy face became even more so. With a heavier heart, he returned to Anshan Steel.

Who could have foreseen that just two months later, Ding and Chen were labeled as "rightists," becoming class enemies! Lu, Shu, and Bai also did not escape their fate. In 1958, Lu and Bai were also labeled as "rightists," and Shu Qu, because there was no real reason to find, was probably to eliminate something, and was also labeled as an "anti-party element" and expelled from the party.

At this critical moment, Comrade Shu Qu did not lose hope and firmly believed that truth would ultimately prevail. He did not complain or grumble but suppressed his gloomy feelings and worked hard. In a few years, he not only wrote the long novel "This Generation" reflecting the struggles of steel workers but also published many excellent short stories. At the same time, he conducted research on classical literature and wrote more than 200 manuscripts. He created over 300,000 words of "Stories of Mao Zedong." In less than ten years, he wrote over 300 manuscripts!

During the "Cultural Revolution," he and his family were severely persecuted, and his 300 manuscripts were burned to ashes!

However, the elderly and weak Shu Qu, over sixty years old, did not bow down or stop in regret and pain. He was beaten at night and recalled and rewrote at night. Especially after the "Gang of Four" was overthrown, until 1979 when he was rectified these three years, he worked day and night, crazily, and rewrote the 300 manuscripts!

In 1979, Comrade Shu Qu came to Beijing for rectification, and we finally met again. He was staying at the Peace Hotel, and I went to visit him. I heard that his health was very poor, and he fainted in the hotel at midnight. I thought he must be very miserable, depressed, and even more gloomy. But to my surprise, Shu Qu seemed like a different person, very optimistic and open. He briefly mentioned the ordeal of the "Cultural Revolution" but enthusiastically and vividly talked about his newly written manuscripts, full of the joy of harvest.

In the last ten years of his life (aged 66-76), his health was deteriorating day by day. He was not only very weak but also, in addition to his original illnesses, had developed a very strange condition: he could only lie down, squat, or sit, and could not stand up. As soon as he stood up, he would faint. One morning in 1982, he fell down the stairs and was unconscious for three hours before being discovered by a cleaning worker and rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. He was even deprived of the freedom to go out for a walk! How miserable! But he did not sigh or complain at all but worked even harder with his pen. He sorted out seven or eight volumes of "Stories of Mao Zedong" and published them, striving to write works reflecting real struggles. He created one exquisite work after another, like a swallow building a nest, bit by bit. Among them, "The Girl Chen" won the National Excellent Short Story Award.

To make the most of his limited time, he posted a note on his door: "The person is seriously ill and follows the doctor's advice to decline visits." He wrote every day without interruption (as long as he could crawl to the table and sit down). Sometimes he only wrote a few hundred words a day, at most five hundred words. His famous works were created like this, bit by bit.

I once suggested that he first sort out the 300 manuscripts, but he said it was not urgent and that he should first write about real struggles, which would have a greater social impact. He seemed unaware of his age and the severity of his illness, acting like a young man, as if he had plenty of time!

In recent years, Comrade Shu Qu had a significant change: he became easily irritable and complained more. This was something he had never done before. He was very dissatisfied with various negative phenomena in society, the corruption in officialdom, and the rampant bourgeois liberalization in the intellectual world, but he was powerless to do anything about it. His body was so weak, but he was always concerned about the party's cause, the future of the country, and the current state of the literary world. His fiery revolutionary heart was always burning his gradually fading body!

Comrade Shu Qu, rest in peace! We will inherit your will and strive forward with all our might!

### 遥寄哀思——悼念舒群同志

    遥寄哀思
    ——悼念舒群同志
    古立高
    在遥远的异国他乡，突然从8月4日《人民日报》上，读到舒群同志于8月2日去世的消息，虽然并不感到过分意外，但仍令人感到十分难过。怀念之情，日夜萦绕心头，只恨不能向他作最后一别。那么，就以这篇短文来寄托我的哀思吧！
    舒群同志是有些怪脾气的人，沉郁寡言，不善交际，更不同流合污、趋炎附势。初见，可能给人难于接近的感觉。但相处久了就会感到，他心地善良，为人耿直、坦白，对同志热诚真挚，处理问题客观公道；对革命事业，忠心耿耿，出生入死，坚贞不屈。不论处在怎样的逆境，他始终坚持原则，从不看风转舵、敷衍苟且。
    我和舒群同志相识，是在1951年，他调来中国文联（后来的中国作协）任秘书长的时候。当时我任机关党支部书记。他来不久，“三反”、“五反”运动就开始了。我们一起搞“运动”，几个月中，日日夜夜（常常到深夜一两点钟）揉在一块，直到1952年春我赴朝访问离开。
    他刚到中国文联时，穿一套宽裤腿的黄咔叽布制服，黑黑的方脸上，嵌着一双亮晶晶的黑眼睛，乍看，极像一个工农干部。他动作缓慢、沉郁，总像若有所思，在主楼的廊下走来走去。
    舒群是老作家，革命老前辈，早在1932年他就加入了中国共产党，并在第三国际中国组工作。“九·一八”事变的第三天，他在哈尔滨参加了抗日义勇军；1935年他在上海参加了左翼作家联盟，并以革命的优秀小说《没有祖国的孩子》而轰动上海文坛。可是，让人感到惊奇的是，他毫无“官”架子，“大”架子，“学阀”架子，和大家坐在一起讨论工作，总是首先听取大家的意见。即使对勤务员同志，他也总是以商量的口气说话：×××同志，请你干点什么什么好吗？当他听到勤务员同志家里有困难时，他便热情地拿出自己节约的积蓄让其接济家用，就像朋友一样。
    舒群同志由于多年颠沛流离及监狱生活，损害了身体的健康。他那时患着很严重的胃病，每每工作、开会到深夜，他总是按着肚子坚持，一直到“三反”运动结束他才住院动手术。谁料祸不单行，大夫粗心大意，竟把一团纱布遗留在腹中。经过了多少痛苦才查清了原因，作了二次手术。从那以后，他的体质越来越差了。
      “三反”、“五反”运动，对反、防贪污浪费、移风易俗起了很好的作用，但那时极左的作法已经冒头，不是实事求是，而是按比例订“打虎”指标，使不少同志受到委屈。舒群同志严于律己，几次向同志们公开检讨，痛心疾首，几次含着眼泪向受委屈的同志们赔礼道歉。多少年后提起来，他仍是心情沉重，感到内疚。
    可是他的善心没有得到善报。从1955年开始，反胡风，尤其是反文艺界有名的“丁、陈”，他也被卷了进去。1950年开东北文艺工作会议时，他和其他几位与会同志发表过一些不同意见，而被批为“罗、舒、白”宗派小圈子；1955年将“材料”转来，升级为“反党小圈子”，后又升级进入大冤案“丁、陈反党集团”，1957年5月，“丁、陈反党集团”平了反，“罗、舒、白反党小圈子”也就不了而了啦。此时我才明白舒群为什么总是那么沉郁寡言、若有所思。而经过这些波折，他那沉郁的脸色是更加沉郁了。他怀着更加沉郁的心情又回了鞍钢。
    谁能料到仅仅过了两个月，丁、陈竟被打成了“右派”，变成了阶级敌人！罗、舒、白也没有逃脱厄运，1958年罗、白也戴上“右派”帽子，舒群因为实在找不到什么借口，但大概是为了根除什么，也被打成“反党分子”，开除了党籍。
    在这严酷的时刻，舒群同志没有丧失信心，深信真理终会胜利。他不抱怨，不发牢骚，只是压抑着沉郁的心情埋头工作。几年之间，他不仅写出了反映钢铁工人斗争的长篇《这一代人》，而且还发表了不少优秀的短篇。同时，他还进行古典文学研究，陆续写了200多万字的著作。他创作了30多万字的《毛泽东的故事》。不足十年光景，他竟写出了300多万字的作品！
  “文化大革命”中，他和他的一家人备受摧残，他那300万字的作品，也被付之一炬！
    可是年过花甲、衰弱多病的舒群，并没有弯腰倒下去，也没有停留在惋惜、伤痛里，白天挨斗，晚上一点点回忆，一笔笔重写，尤其是“四人帮”垮台以后，直到1979年平反这三年，他日以继夜、疯狂般地工作，竟把300万字的作品重新草写了出来！
    1979年舒群同志来京平反，我们终于又会面了。他住在和平宾馆，我去看他。听说他身体极坏，半夜晕死在宾馆。我以为他一定非常狼狈、沮丧，心情更加沉郁。可是完全出乎我的意外，舒群同志像变了一个人，非常乐观、开朗。“文化大革命”的遭遇，他一言带过，却兴致勃勃，如数家珍，述说着他那重新草成的部部著作，充满着收获的喜悦。
    在临告别人世的最后十年里（66—76岁），他的身体一天不如一天了。他不仅十分虚弱，而且除了原来的疾病，又增添了一种非常奇怪的病症：只能躺卧蹲坐，不能站起身子，只要站起，立时就会晕倒。1982年的一天清晨，他从楼梯上栽倒下来，死过去三个小时才为清洁工同志发现送医院急救。他连出屋散散步的自由也被剥夺了！苦矣哉！可是他没有丝毫的唉声叹气，而是更加奋力笔耕。他前后整理出了七八篇《毛泽东的故事》发表，尽力抢时间写反映现实斗争的作品。他如蚕吐丝般源源创作出一篇篇精美的作品，其中《少年Chen女》获得了全国优秀短篇小说奖。
    为了抓紧不多的时间，他在门上贴了一个条子：“本人病重，遵医嘱谢绝会客”。他每天笔耕，从不中断（只要他能爬起来坐到桌前）。有时一天只写一二百字，最多不过五百字。他那些脍炙人口的作品，就是这样燕子垒窝似地一点一滴创作出来的。
    我曾建议他先把那300万字的旧稿整理出来，他却说不急，要先写反映现实的东西，这更能收到社会效益。他好似毫未意识到他的年龄、他的疾病的严重性，俨然一个青壮年一般，似乎来日方长！
    这几年，舒群同志有一个极大的变化，就是容易发脾气，发牢骚。这是他过去所没有的。他对社会上的种种消极现象，对官场的种种腐败现象，对知识界泛滥的资产阶级自由化现象极为不满，而又无能为力。他身体那么不好，却无时不在关怀着党的事业，关怀着国家的前途，关怀着文艺界的现状。他那颗火热的革命之心，始终在燃烧着他那渐渐熄灭的躯体！
    舒群同志，安息吧！我们将继承你的遗志，不遗余力地奋力向前！
