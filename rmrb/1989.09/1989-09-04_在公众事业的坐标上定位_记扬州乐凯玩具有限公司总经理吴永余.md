Four years ago, the West Lake Township Party Committee of Yangzhou decided to appoint the outstanding Communist Party member Wu Yongyu as the director of the township-run toy factory.

Is this even a factory? The warehouse was filled with moldy products, and the workers had nothing to do. Wu Yongyu lamented, "Why don't we cherish the fruits of the workers' labor?" The warehouse keeper gave him a disdainful look: "The better it all rots, the easier it is to manage here!" The factory operated on a "three days of work, two days of rest" schedule, and wages couldn't be paid; the factory buildings were dilapidated, and morale was low. Wu Yongyu felt the weight of his responsibilities as soon as he arrived.

Wu Yongyu had high aspirations. At the township industrial conference, he boldly set a target of 1.5 million yuan in annual output, which shocked many people. Wu Yongyu believed that toys, a product mainly relying on intelligence and manual skills, had a bright future.

"The key is the lack of unique products," Wu Yongyu thought. To produce unique products, one needs a design team. Wu Yongyu started from this point. He led the core team to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing, day and night, visiting and learning, expanding their horizons. At the Canton Fair, they discovered that synthetic fiber stuffed toys were highly favored by foreign traders. Soon, their designed and manufactured hanging bears and thin-pull dogs appeared in the market. That year, the factory's sales reached 2.01 million yuan.

Wu Yongyu was not satisfied. In 1986, a distinctive "Market Information Feedback Center" was established in the West Lake Toy Factory, hiring translators to collect information on foreign toys and related economic and cultural backgrounds, sending staff to participate in the Canton Fair, and to Germany, Italy, and France for inspections.

In February 1987, Wu Yongyu, along with a delegation organized by the China Light Industry Products Import and Export Corporation, attended the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, West Germany. For over a month, he didn't buy any "big items" or "small items," spending all his limited foreign exchange on purchasing materials and taking photos. He even picked up discarded toy magazines from others and brought them back to his residence. Upon returning to China, his luggage was filled with materials. The factory's staff were surprised: "Why did you bring back so much paper?" Wu Yongyu smiled and said, "This is more valuable than anything else, and it's useful!"

After gaining an initial understanding of foreign cultures, habits, and interests, Wu Yongyu led the design team to organically combine China's traditional crafts with Western national tastes, designing elegant and unique mid-to-high-end toys. These were launched in Western Europe and the Middle East markets and were highly favored, with sales skyrocketing. The output was 6 million yuan in 1986, 14.04 million yuan in 1987, and reached 20.04 million yuan in 1988.

When asked about the secret of his success, Wu Yongyu said, "There's really no secret. I think that to achieve success in one's career, one must have a firm will, lofty aspirations, and down-to-earth work. Say less empty talk, do more practical work, and the masses will follow you and be united with you."

Today, the toy factory has undergone a tremendous transformation. The former 10 dilapidated small workshops have become 13,000 square meters of tall buildings; the workforce has grown from a few dozen to over 3,000; the products have developed from a single variety to 6 categories and over 2,000 varieties, selling in more than 20 countries and regions, becoming the largest toy production base in Jiangsu Province.

    在公众事业的坐标上定位
    ——记扬州乐凯玩具有限公司总经理吴永余
    吴功学　王福根
    4年前，扬州郊区西湖乡党委决定调优秀共产党员吴永余任乡办玩具厂厂长。
    这也是厂子吗？仓库里积压的产品发了霉，工人无事干。吴永余心疼地说：“为什么不珍惜工人的劳动成果？”保管员翻了他一眼：“全烂了才好哩！要没产品摆，这里也空着。”工厂“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，工资发不出；厂房破旧，人心不稳。吴永余一到这里就感到了肩头担子的沉重。
    偏偏吴永余心气高，在乡工业会议上，他竟报出年产值150万元的指标，很多人吓了一跳。吴永余不相信，玩具，这一主要靠脑的智慧和手的技巧生产的产品会没有前途！
      “关键没有自己的独特产品。”老吴认为，生产独特产品要有一支自己的设计队伍。吴永余从这一点抓起。他带领骨干跑广州，跑上海，跑南京，日夜兼程，参观学习，开拓思路。在广交会上，他们发现化纤绒玩具很受外商青睐，很快，他们设计制作的挂熊、薄拉狗等玩具出现在市场。这一年厂子的销售额达到201万元。
    吴永余并不满足。1986年，一个颇具特色的“市场信息反馈中心”在西湖玩具厂建立起来了，聘请翻译人员收集国外玩具和有关经济文化背景资料，派员参加广交会，赴联邦德国、意大利、法国考察。
      1987年2月，吴永余随同中国轻工业品进出口总公司组织的代表团到西德纽伦堡参加国际玩具博览会。一个多月，他什么
  “大件”、“小件”都没舍得买，把仅有的一点外汇全买了资料、拍了照片。别人丢弃的玩具杂志，他也拣回住处。回国时，资料塞满包。厂里的同志感到吃惊：“你带回的怎么都是纸头？”老吴笑道：“这可比任何东西都值钱，都有用啊！”
    初步了解了外国人的文化、习惯、兴趣爱好以后，吴永余带领设计人员把中国的传统工艺与西方民族的趣味有机地结合起来，设计出款式新颖、雅观别致的中高档玩具，投放到西欧、中东市场后，深受青睐，销量直线上升。1986年产值600万元，1987年1404万元，1988年达到2004万元。
    有人问吴永余成功的诀窍，他说：“其实也没有什么诀窍。我觉得，一个人要在事业上获得成功，就要有坚定的意志，志向高远，工作踏实。少说空话，多办实事，群众就会跟你学，和你一条心。”
    如今的玩具厂，面貌大变。昔日10间破旧小厂房，变成了1.3万平方米的高大楼房；职工由几十人发展到3000多人；产品由单一品种发展到6大类2000多个品种，畅销20多个国家和地区，成为江苏省最大的玩具生产基地。
