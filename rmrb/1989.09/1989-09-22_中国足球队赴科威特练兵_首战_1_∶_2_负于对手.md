The Chinese football team played a friendly match against the Kuwait national team at the Ezma Sports Stadium in Kuwait tonight and lost 1:2.

In this match, the Chinese team employed a long-pass and quick-attack strategy, focusing on the center. The Kuwaiti team, on the other hand, used a ball-control and counter-attack strategy to counter the Chinese team's tactics.

In the first half, 13 minutes into the match, the Kuwaiti team exploited a gap in the Chinese team's defense and scored a goal, taking a 1-0 lead. The Chinese team launched several counterattacks and had multiple shots on goal, but none were successful. In the early minutes of the second half, both teams engaged in intense competition with fast-paced play. At the 25-minute mark, Chinese player number 6, Wu Qunli, dribbled past the opposing goalkeeper and shot, but the ball narrowly missed the left side of the goalpost. One minute later, player number 2, Zhu Bo, made a precise pass, and player number 10, Ma Lin, headed the ball cleanly into the net, tying the score at 1-1. With just one minute left in the match, the Kuwaiti team again exploited a gap in the Chinese team's defense and scored another goal, ultimately winning the match 2-1.

This match served as a warm-up for the Chinese team, which has already qualified for the Asian qualifying group for the World Cup. The team is currently preparing for the upcoming six-nation tournament in Singapore next month.

    中国足球队赴科威特练兵
    首战1∶2负于对手
    新华社科威特9月20日电  （记者李士兴）中国足球队今晚在科威特额兹玛体育场同科威特国家队进行一场精彩的友谊赛，中国队以1∶2失利。
    这场比赛，中国队采用长传快攻的战术，重点打中路；科威特队则采用控球倒传、伺机直插的战术来对付。
    上半场开赛13分钟，科威特队抓住中国队防守的空隙射门进球，夺得1分。中国队多次组织反攻，频频射门，但均未奏效。下半场一开始，双方以快对快场上争夺激烈。25分钟时，中国队6号吴群立带球盘过对方守门员后射门，可惜球擦左外侧门网而过，打空了。
    一分钟后，2号朱波传球恰到好处，10号马林跃起顶球，干净利索地进了一球，双方打成平局。离比赛结束还差1分钟时，科威特队再次利用中国队防守漏洞踢进一球，终于以一球的优势战胜了中国队。
    这场比赛，对中国队来说是一场热身赛。中国队在世界杯亚洲区第5组比赛中出线，正在为下月在新加坡的亚洲六强赛作准备。
