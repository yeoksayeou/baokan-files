Comrades:

Today, to celebrate the annual Teachers' Day, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Personnel, and the All-China Teachers' Association jointly held a conference to commend and reward teachers who have made outstanding achievements in teaching and educating people. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm congratulations to the teachers being commended and, on this occasion, I extend my greetings and highest respect to all teachers of all ethnic groups across the country.

In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our socialist construction has achieved tremendous successes, and the educational cause has also developed significantly. These achievements are inseparable from the hard work of the vast number of teachers. The development of the state has undergone a tortuous process, and the teaching corps has also undergone one test after another. The vast number of teachers have devoted their hearts and souls to cultivating talents for the new China, and now their students have become or are becoming the backbone of various fronts. During the "Cultural Revolution," the educational cause was severely damaged, and the teaching corps also suffered a great impact. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the vast number of teachers made new contributions to the development and reform of China's education and to the modernization of socialist construction. Many teachers, despite having suffered unfair treatment in history, and despite the hard living and working conditions, have remained loyal to the people's educational cause for decades. Forty years of practice have proven that China's teaching corps is a good corps. Ten years ago, the central authorities overturned the "two estimates" imposed on intellectuals by the "Gang of Four," clearly stating that intellectuals are part of the working class. Now, the Party and the state once again affirm that China's intellectuals, including the vast number of teachers, are still part of the working class. In the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the vast majority of China's teachers have shown good conduct, remaining loyal to the Party and to the socialist motherland. Therefore, this basic assessment will not change because of this.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee pointed out that we will continue to firmly implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" and continue to strive for the development strategy of socialist modernization construction. Undoubtedly, we will also continue to implement the policy of "education must serve socialist construction, and socialist construction must rely on education," and continuously promote the development of the educational cause and the deepening of educational reform. Respecting knowledge, respecting talent, and respecting teachers is a fundamental state policy of ours, and there is no reason to change it now. Currently, China's economy is in a period of rectification and adjustment, and there are certain financial difficulties. The educational work has also exposed some prominent problems in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, but we must not neglect education because of this. All levels of Party committees and governments must firmly implement the spirit of the Thirteenth Congress, and truly place the development of education in a prominent position in economic construction and social development. They must mobilize the entire society to care for and support the educational cause, and through various channels, strive to increase educational investment. We must continue to unite with and rely on the vast number of teachers. Politically, we must take all measures, including legislative means, to ensure the gradual improvement of the political and ideological, moral, and teaching standards of the teaching corps, and improve their working and living conditions. Many elder revolutionary comrades of the proletariat not only devoted their entire lives to the establishment and development of the socialist system but also spent a great deal of effort caring for and supporting China's educational cause. Leaders of all levels of Party committees and governments should learn from their far-sighted strategic vision and solid work style, and seriously do some practical work to mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of teachers and to develop the educational cause.

China's education is socialist education, and its fundamental task is to cultivate talents needed for the socialist cause. From the student movement to the turmoil, and then to the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the process shows that foreign hostile forces will always seize various opportunities to realize their strategy of peaceful evolution; and those within the country who insist on bourgeois liberalization always attempt to bring our country onto the capitalist track. One of their important targets in contention with us is the schools and young students. If we do not maintain a clear mind and do not place the firm and correct political direction in the first place in school work, it will not only affect the educational work but also have a serious impact on the future of the Party and the state.

Teachers are the engineers of the human soul. The ideological and moral, intellectual, and physical conditions of China's youth, to a considerable extent, depend on the work of the vast number of teachers. The conduct of teachers has an important influence on young people, and what is required of students, teachers should first do themselves. To educate students to support the Party's leadership and support socialism, teachers should first love the Party and love socialism; to educate students to establish the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, teachers should first be selfless and devoted to their duties; to educate students to strive hard, teachers should be thrifty and simple. Educators should first be educated. The vast number of teachers should set an example for students with their exemplary conduct and set a model for them. To do this, teachers should continuously learn and improve. They should not only learn professional knowledge but also learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and learn the Party's policies. Currently, they should first learn the various decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and actively participate in the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. This is not only the need for teachers' work but also the Party and the state's earnest expectation and political concern for the vast number of teachers.

Comrades, the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion have achieved decisive victories. Both difficulties and favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties lie before us. In the past 40 years, the Party has led the people of the whole country to overcome many difficulties, achieve great successes, and also rely on the Party's own strength to correct mistakes made in the process of advancement. Now, we can also overcome various difficulties and continue to advance. We hope that the vast number of teachers will closely unite around the Party Central Committee, boost their spirits, and make new contributions to upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, to upholding reform and opening up, to developing and reforming the educational cause, and to cultivating successors for the socialist cause.

### 坚持坚定正确的政治方向  发展我国的教育事业——李鹏同志在庆祝教师节表彰大会上的讲话

    坚持坚定正确的政治方向
    发展我国的教育事业
    ——李鹏同志在庆祝教师节表彰大会上的讲话
    1989年9月8日
    同志们：
    今天，为庆祝一年一度的教师节，国家教委、人事部和中国教育工会联合召开大会，表彰奖励在教书育人工作中做出显著成绩的教师。我代表党中央、国务院向受表彰的同志表示热烈的祝贺，并借此机会，向全国各族广大教师致以节日的慰问和崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国成立40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，我国的社会主义建设取得了巨大成就，教育事业也有了很大发展。这些成绩，是同广大教师辛勤劳动分不开的。国家发展经历了曲折的历程，教师队伍也经受了一次又一次的考验。广大教师为培养新中国的建设人才呕心沥血，如今已是桃李满天下，他们的学生已经或正将成为各条战线的骨干。“文化大革命”中，教育事业受到严重摧残，教师队伍也受到很大冲击。十一届三中全会后，广大教师又为我国教育的发展和改革，为社会主义现代化建设做出了新的贡献。许多教师不计较历史上遭受过不公正的待遇，不计较清苦的生活条件和艰苦的工作条件，几十年如一日，忠于人民的教育事业。40年的实践证明，我国的教师队伍，是一支好的队伍。10年前，中央推倒了“四人帮”强加在知识分子头上的“两个估计”，明确了知识分子是工人阶级的一部分。现在，党和国家再一次重申，包括广大教师在内的我国知识分子仍然是工人阶级的一部分。在不久前发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中，我国绝大多数教师的表现是好的，是忠于党、忠于社会主义祖国的。因此这一基本估计，不会因此而改变。
    党的十三届四中全会指出，我们将继续坚定不移地执行“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，继续为实现社会主义现代化建设的发展战略而努力奋斗。毫无疑问，也将继续贯彻“教育必须为社会主义建设服务，社会主义建设必须依靠教育”的方针，不断推动教育事业的发展和教育改革的深入。尊重知识，尊重人才，尊师重教，是我们国家的一项基本国策，现在没有任何理由改变。目前，我国经济处在治理、整顿期间，财政存在一定困难，教育工作在动乱和反革命暴乱中也暴露一些突出的问题，但绝不能因此而忽视教育。各级党委和政府要坚决贯彻十三大精神，切实把发展教育摆到经济建设和社会发展的突出位置，发动全社会关心和支持教育事业，通过多种渠道，努力增加教育投入。要继续团结、依靠广大教师。在政治上，要采取一切措施，包括运用立法手段，保证教师队伍的政治思想、道德素质和教学业务水平的逐步提高，改善他们的工作条件和生活条件。很多老一辈无产阶级革命家不仅为社会主义制度的建立和发展贡献了毕生的精力，而且花费了很大心血关心和支持我国的教育事业。各级党委和政府领导人应该学习他们远大的战略眼光和扎实的工作作风，为调动广大教师的积极性，为发展教育事业，认真地办一些实事。
    我国的教育是社会主义的教育，它的根本任务是培养社会主义事业需要的人才。从学潮到动乱，进而在北京发生反革命暴乱的过程说明，国外的敌对势力总会利用各种机会实现其和平演变的战略；国内坚持资产阶级自由化的人，也总是妄图把我们的国家纳入资本主义轨道。他们同我们争夺的一个重要目标，就是学校和青年学生。如果我们不能保持清醒的头脑，不把坚持坚定正确的政治方向摆在学校工作的第一位，不仅会给教育工作，而且会对党和国家的前途带来严重影响。
    教师是人类灵魂的工程师。我国青少年的思想品德、智力和体魄状况，在相当程度上决定于广大教师的工作。教师的言行对青少年起着重要的影响，要求学生做到的，教师首先应该做到。教育学生拥护党的领导，拥护社会主义，教师首先应该热爱党，热爱社会主义；要学生树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，教师首先应该不计名利，忠于职守；要学生艰苦奋斗，教师应该勤俭朴素。教育者应该先受教育。广大教师要为人师表，以自己的楷模行为，为学生树立榜样。要做到这一点，教师就应不断地学习和提高。不仅要学习业务知识，而且要学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学习党的方针政策。当前，首先要学习十三届四中全会的各项决定，积极投入反对资产阶级自由化的斗争。这不仅是教师的工作需要，也是党和国家对广大教师的殷切期望和政治上的关怀。
    同志们，制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱已经取得了决定性的胜利。摆在我们面前的既有许多困难，更有很多战胜困难的有利条件，在过去的40年中，党领导全国人民战胜了许多困难，取得了巨大成就，也依靠党自身的力量纠正了前进中的失误。现在，我们同样能够克服各种困难，继续前进。我们希望广大教师紧密团结在党中央周围，振奋精神，为坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，为发展和改革教育事业，为培养社会主义事业的接班人做出新的贡献。　（新华社发）
