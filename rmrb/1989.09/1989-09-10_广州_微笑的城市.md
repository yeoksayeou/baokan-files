Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have formulated the "Three-Year Plan for Beautifying Guangzhou City," the "Guangzhou Cultural Development Strategic Outline," the "Guangzhou Science and Technology Development Strategic Outline," and the "Guangzhou People's Civilized Covenant," among others. They have extensively promoted the activities of "Being a Civilized Citizen, Creating a Civilized Unit, and Building a Civilized Guangzhou."

In 1987, the entire city responded enthusiastically to the call from the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government to "Promote New Social Customs and Welcome the Sixth National Games." Over 100,000 young people participated in the "Smiling Guangzhou" series of activities to build socialist spiritual civilization, initiated by the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. 101 public bus routes and 328 units, along with the general public, participated in the "Friendship in the Carriage" activity organized by the First Public Bus Company. Over 500,000 families participated in the "Beautiful Family" cultural activity organized by the Municipal Women's Federation. Over 100,000 workers and 90,000 individual business owners participated in the activities of evaluating the best service units, evaluating the best service agencies at the grassroots level, and the "Trustworthy Stall" activities. The military, police, and civilians jointly built the civilized Zhongshan Road and the civilized Pearl River. Currently, there are 593 joint construction points. These mass activities have promoted the further improvement of social customs and have been praised by domestic and foreign participants of the Sixth National Games.

In 1988, Guangzhou launched the "88 Yangcheng Courtesy Year" activity, focusing on "Promoting Courteous Behavior and Building a Smiling Guangzhou." It widely promoted civilized language such as "Hello! Please! Sorry, Thank you, Goodbye" among the people. In the service industry, it promoted the use of standard Mandarin and civilized service language, as well as standardized service regulations, further improving the service level.

This year, the people of Guangzhou have launched the "Love My China, Love My Guangzhou" series of activities to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Guangzhou. Through extensive discussions and the formulation of Guangzhou's "City Spirit," "Guangzhou Spirit," "City Song," and "City Emblem," they have aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire city and invigorated the spirit of the people of Guangzhou. Among the 1.9 million workers in the city, 10,826 reading groups have been organized, and 650,000 people have participated in self-study activities, with 4,425 people achieving success through self-study. Over 200,000 farmers have participated in agricultural science and technology learning, and over 30,000 individual laborers have participated in the "Orange Plan" training aimed at improving the political awareness of individual business owners. During the political turmoil this year, the people of Guangzhou have worked hard to maintain stability and unity. Over 5,000 factories in the city have not stopped production, demonstrating a high sense of ownership.

In recent years, Guangzhou has summarized and promoted the experience of Nanhuaxi Street in building a civilized new street by simultaneously promoting both material and spiritual civilizations. The Guangzhou Waste Treatment Plant has shown a spirit of dedication with the motto "Willing to be dirty for the sake of others' health." The Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Factory has been commended for its daring reforms, bold innovations, and management methods that rely on policies, talent, and operations. The Guangzhou Restaurant has been praised for its new service spirit of "Sincerely warming the hearts of customers." Currently, there are 370,000 civilized families in the city, accounting for 40% of the total households.

　　广州—微笑的城市
    党的十一届三中全会以来，中共广州市委、市政府为了加强社会主义精神文明建设，制订了《三年美化广州城规划》、《广州文化发展战略纲要》、《广州科学技术发展战略纲要》以及《广州市人民文明公约》等，在全市广泛开展了“做文明市民、创文明单位、建文明广州”的活动。
    1987年，全市人民热烈响应市委、市政府提出的“树社会新风、迎六届全运”的号召，100多万青少年参加了由共青团市委发起的“微笑的广州”建设社会主义精神文明系列活动；101条公共汽车线路、328个单位和广大乘客参加了第一公共汽车公司开展的“友爱在车厢”活动；50多万户家庭成员参加了市妇联组织的“美的家庭”文化活动；10多万职工以及9万多个体户参加了市民评议最佳服务单位，基层评议最佳服务机关与“信得过”摊档活动；军警民开展共建文明中山路和共建文明珠江活动，目前军民共建点已达593个。这些群众性活动，促进了社会风气进一步好转，赢得了参加第六届全国运动会的国内外人士的好评。
    1988年，广州又开展了以“推广礼貌活动、建设微笑广州”为主要内容的“88羊城礼貌年”活动，在人民群众中大力推广了“您好！请！对不起、谢谢、再见”等文明用语；在服务行业广泛推广普通话和文明服务用语以及服务规范化条例，进一步提高了服务水平。
    今年，羊城人民为了迎接国庆40周年和广州解放40周年，又投入了“爱我中华、爱我广州”系列活动，并通过广泛发动群众讨论和制定广州市“市风”、“广州人精神”和“市歌”、“市徽”，激发了全市人民的爱国热情，振奋了广州人精神。全市190万职工中组织了10826个读书小组，65万人参加了读书自学活动，自学成才者达4425人。20多万农民参加了农业科学技术学习，3万多个体劳动者参加了旨在提高个体户政治觉悟的“橙色计划”培训。在今年发生政治动乱期间，广州广大市民努力维护安定团结，全市5000多个工厂没有一间停工，表现出了高度的主人翁精神。
    近几年来，广州市总结和推广了南华西街坚持两个文明一起抓、建设文明新街道的经验，广州卫生处理厂“宁愿一人脏、换来万人康”的奉献精神；表彰了白云山制药总厂敢于改革，勇于开拓，靠政策、靠人才、靠经营管理的治厂之道以及广州酒家“诚暖顾客心”的服务新风。目前，全市涌现出37万个文明家庭，文明家庭占总户数的40％。
