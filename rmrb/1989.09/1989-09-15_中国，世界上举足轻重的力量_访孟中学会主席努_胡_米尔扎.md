China, a Powerful Force in the World
An Interview with the Chairman of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Association, Nu Hu Mirza

By Wen Xian, Correspondent of the People's Daily

“Over the past 40 years, China has transformed from the 'Sick Man of East Asia' into a powerful force in the world. Now, no one can ignore China's existence and strength. This is a great achievement!” Nu Hu Mirza, who is visiting China for the seventh time, said these words to the reporter with both sincerity and warmth in his demeanor.

At 60 years old, Mirza is an old friend of the Chinese people. This influential writer, translator, and social activist from Bangladesh was involved in political activities in his early years, serving as the vice-chairman of the National People's Party and the chairman of the Democratic Party. Later, due to health reasons, he dedicated himself to promoting friendship between the peoples of Bangladesh and China. In 1983, he established the "Understanding China Committee" (renamed the Bangladesh-China Friendship Association in 1985), doing extensive work to deepen the understanding of the Chinese people among the people of Bangladesh. Over the years, despite living a frugal life alone and facing health issues, he has written works such as "The Endless Yellow River" and edited and translated books like "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and "The 13th Party Congress and Reform." He passionately introduces the progress of the Chinese people to his fellow countrymen. "Friendship and understanding between peoples never fade. As long as I am alive, I will do my best for the Bangladesh-China friendship!" Mirza said enthusiastically.

The publication of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Association, "A Billion People's Country," closely follows the construction achievements of the Chinese people, translating and introducing the progress of China's reform and opening-up. "I have read many books about Chinese history. Before 1949, China was torn apart by various foreign forces and local warlords, and society was dark..." He then talked about the profound changes that have taken place in China since the founding of New China. "Especially, the economic construction achievements of China in the past ten years have left a deep impression." Indeed, since his first visit to China in 1981, Mirza has almost visited China every year. He has witnessed with his own eyes how the vitality unleashed by the reform and opening-up policies has rapidly transformed China's landscape. In 1985, Mirza spent a week in Fengyang County, where he learned about the tragic history of Fengyang County, where "the fields had no wheat, the wilds had no grass, refugees filled the roads, and starving people ate each other." In those days, the people of Fengyang left their homes and begged on the streets: "Sing the flower drum, cross the Yellow River, tears more than waves." But now, what Mirza saw was a new Fengyang. He heard a new flower drum song: "Sing the past, mud houses, mud beds, mud bins with no grain, three meals a day of thin soup; sing the present, live in brick houses, eat fine grains, TV sofa new-style bed, and still have money to save in the bank. Truly, heaven and earth are different!" Mirza repeated this sentence with deep emotion.

"Actually, the leaders of China quickly proposed the issue of modernization after national liberation. But how to choose a modernization path based on China's national conditions has always been a major issue facing the Chinese people. Although China has made mistakes and taken detours in its development over the past 40 years, I have always believed that without the socialist path, China has no future; without reform and opening-up, China cannot prosper." Mirza waved his arms, quite emotionally: "Who can tell me, in the historical conditions of political, economic, and cultural backwardness, how can China, without the socialist path, change the poverty and backwardness of places like Qinghai and Ningxia?! Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, what kind of future would China have?" On June 14 of this year, Mirza wrote in a letter to our country's leaders: "Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, history has repeatedly proven that, except for the Communist Party of China, China has had and will have no other political force that can maintain national unity. Therefore, maintaining China's unity, allowing dozens of ethnic groups to live harmoniously under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in the same country, is not only to ensure that 1.1 billion Chinese people can progress normally and continuously, but also to maintain the balance of world forces, which is beneficial for peace and disarmament." At this moment, the reporter seemed to see that Mirza's frail body was surging with deep affection. "As an old friend of the Chinese people, I want to frankly talk about my views: I am also very saddened by some corrupt phenomena in Chinese society. Now the Communist Party of China is taking steps to solve these problems. As long as the announced measures are seriously implemented, the party and the people will be more united. We are all paying attention to the implementation of these measures." He said, "China is a big country and also a developing country. China's achievements have great reference value for the development of Third World countries. China is a country with potential. Although you encounter temporary difficulties, China is a country with hope. I personally have no doubt about this."

　　中国，世界上举足轻重的力量
　　访孟中学会主席努·胡·米尔扎

    “40年来，中国从‘东亚病夫’一变成为世界上举足轻重的力量。现在，任何人都不能忽视中国的存在和力量。这就是伟大的成就！”已经是第七次访华的努·胡·米尔扎紧握记者的手说这番话时，神态既真挚，又祥和。
    今年60岁的米尔扎是中国人民的老朋友。这位孟加拉国极有影响的作家、翻译家和社会活动家，早年从事政治活动，曾任民族人民党副主席和民主党主席，后因健康等原因，专事孟中人民友好工作。1983年，他创建“了解中国委员会”（1985年改名为孟中学会），为加深孟加拉国人民对中国的了解做了大量工作。几年来，在俭朴的独居生活和健康欠佳情况下，他撰写了《不尽黄河》等著作，并编译出版了《邓小平文选》、《十三大与改革》等书，热情满怀地向本国人民介绍中国人民的前进步伐。“人民之间的友谊和了解永不泯灭，只要我还活着，就要为孟中友好事业尽力！”米尔扎热情地说。
    由米尔扎主编的孟中学会刊物《十亿人民之邦》，对中国人民的建设成就始终密切关注，专门翻译、介绍中国改革、开放等进展情况。“我读过不少有关中国历史的书。1949年以前，中国被各种外国势力和地方军阀撕扯得四分五裂，社会黑暗……”接着他谈到新中国诞生后中国大地发生的天翻地覆的变化。“特别是中国十年来的经济建设成就给人的印象尤为深刻。”是的，自从1981年首次访华以来，米尔扎几乎年年访问中国。他亲眼看到在改革、开放政策催化下，勃发的生机使中国的面貌迅速改观。1985年，米尔扎在凤阳县的一个星期，使他了解了昔日凤阳县“田无麦禾，野无青草，流徙载道，饥民相食”的悲惨史页，也听说过那段反映凤阳地区十年九荒的催人泪下的花鼓词。那年月，凤阳百姓离乡背井，行乞街头：“唱花鼓，过黄河，泪花更比浪花多。”可如今，米尔扎见到的却是一个新的凤阳，他听到了一段新的花鼓词：“唱过去，泥巴房，泥巴床，泥巴囤里没有粮，一日三餐喝稀汤；唱现在，住瓦房，吃细粮，电视沙发新式床，还有余钱存银行。真是天壤之别呵！”这句话，米尔扎感触万千地重复了两遍。
    “其实，中国领导人在全国解放以后便很快提出了现代化问题。但如何依据中国国情选择现代化道路，则一直是摆在中国人民面前的大问题。尽管40年来中国在发展过程中也有过错误，走过弯路，但我始终坚信，不走社会主义道路，中国就没有前途；没有改革、开放，中国就不可能繁荣昌盛。”米尔扎挥动手臂，颇为动情：“有谁能告诉我，在政治、经济、文化极为落后的历史条件中走出来的中国，不走社会主义道路，如何能改变像青海、宁夏等地的贫困落后状态呢？！没有中国共产党的领导，中国会是怎样一种前途？”今年6月14日，米尔扎在给我国领导人的一封信中特别指出：“自推翻清王朝以来，历史一再证明，除了中国共产党，中国没有、也不可能有别的政治力量能够保持国家的统一。因此，维护中国的统一，使几十个民族能在中国共产党的领导下和谐地生活在同一国度里，这不仅是为了保证11亿中国人民能正常、持续地进步，而且也是为了保持世界力量的均势，以利于和平与裁军。”此刻，记者仿佛看到，米尔扎那瘦弱的身躯内正涌动着脉脉深情。“作为中国人民的老朋友，我想坦率地谈谈我的看法：我对中国社会出现的一些腐败现象也很痛心。现在中国共产党已着手解决这些问题。只要认真执行已宣布的各项措施，党和人民将会更加同心同德。我们都在关注这些措施的贯彻执行。”他说，“中国是个大国，也是一个发展中国家。中国的成就对第三世界国家的发展很有借鉴意义。中国是有潜力的国家。尽管你们遇到暂时的困难，但中国是有希望的。我本人对此坚信不疑。”
