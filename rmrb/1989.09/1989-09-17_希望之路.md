The Path of Hope

“Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ’s family is a hardworking and prosperous household, a true household with an annual income of 10,000 yuan…”

The rumors from Xùmù Township in Bōmì County stirred my heart as I passed through. On a rainy day during the autumn harvest, I visited the remote Nán Dǎo Village in Xùmù Township to meet Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ, drawn by his reputation.

The homes of millionaire households in the eastern Tibetan countryside are new, their clothing is fine, their furniture is complete, and their carpets are of high quality. In contrast, this family of nine crammed into one large room and five small rooms, dressed in old Tibetan clothing. Inside the house, there was only one used radio-cassette player and not a single piece of decent furniture.

Nearly fifty years old, Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ welcomed us into his home with a smile. When he heard that I wanted to discuss his experiences as a commercial grain specialist, he took out a small notebook and eagerly began to talk:

“We have five male laborers and three female laborers in our family. After the implementation of the responsibility system, the 40 mu of land we contracted was not enough to farm. I always wanted to try my hand at developing agriculture to get rich, and the government gave me an opportunity.”

In 1987, the Bōmì County government used land abandoned by the second labor reform team of the Autonomous Region to establish a commercial grain base in Xùmù Township. Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ reached an agreement with the county agricultural bureau to produce commercial grain, contracting 160 mu of land that had been abandoned for three years. He led his entire family to clear the land and build fences around it. Guided by county agricultural technicians, he planted barley and rapeseed on 60 mu of land, applying 600 kilograms of fertilizer; in the remaining 100 mu, he planted peas, and that year he achieved a considerable harvest.

“To improve production, money must first be invested in production.” Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ paused for a moment, sharing his personal experience. Three years ago, Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ had prepared money to build a new house. But he used the 11,800 yuan he had saved to purchase a “Tie Niu 55” type tractor, a hand-held tractor, and small harvesting and threshing machines. Last year, his family’s agricultural production was basically mechanized. Plowing, harvesting, transporting crops, threshing, and winnowing took only 40 days in total. Starting in 1987, he increased the amount of fertilizer used each year, and the crops on 200 mu of land grew well. Last year, Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ’s family produced 24,500 kilograms of grain. This year, they are expected to exceed last year’s harvest.

Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ led his entire family in agricultural and sideline production, completing the state’s commercial grain contract purchase tasks year after year. In 1987, the family sold 5,000 kilograms of commercial grain, 10,000 kilograms the following year, and this year they will sell 12,500 kilograms. Last year, the family’s total income was 350,000 yuan, with a net income of 150,000 yuan; 3,500 kilograms of wheat seeds have already been exchanged by half of the local people.

When I asked about his future plans, Qiǎo Zhū Mǎ thought for a moment and said: “Before the democratic reforms, our family begged for food along the road to Xùmù. We had no food for the next meal. Without the Communist Party, we could not escape our miserable lives. Today, we can become rich thanks to the Communist Party’s policy of enriching the people. In the future, my goal is to continue to focus on production and contribute more to the country.”

　　希望之路
    “启珠玛一家是勤劳致富的专业户，真正的万元户……”
    路经波密县，来自许木乡的传闻牵动了我的心。秋收期间的一个阴雨天，我慕名前往地处偏僻的许木乡南岛村，拜访启珠玛。
    藏东农村的万元户，住房新，穿戴好，家具配套，卡垫档次高。眼前这一家，9口人挤在1大间、5小间旧房里，身穿旧藏装。屋子里只有1部用旧的收录机，没有1件象样的家具。
    年近五旬的启珠玛乐呵呵地将我们迎进住房。听说要他谈当商品粮专业户的体会，他拿出一个小本子，兴奋地谈了起来：
    “我们一家有5个男劳力、3个女劳力。实行生产责任制后，承包的40亩地不够种。我总想闯一闯，走发展农业致富的路子，政府给了我一个机会。”
    1987年，波密县政府利用自治区第二劳改支队放弃的土地，在许木乡建立商品粮基地。启珠玛同县农牧局达成生产商品粮的协议，承包已荒废3年的160亩地。他带着全家人一边开地，一边围起篱笆。经县农技人员指导，他在60亩地上种植青稞、油菜，施上600公斤化肥；在剩下的100亩地里种上豌豆，当年就获得了可观的收成。
    “要把生产搞上去，手头的钱就得先花在生产上。”启珠玛沉思片刻，谈了自己的切身体会。3年前，启珠玛就准备了盖新房的钱。但他把积蓄起来的11800元用来购置了“铁牛55”型拖拉机、手扶拖拉机和小型收割机、脱粒机等农业机械。去年，他一家从事农业生产基本上实现机械化。耕地、收割、运庄稼、脱粒、扬场，总共只用40天时间。从1987年开始，他逐年增加化肥施用量，200亩地的庄稼长势普遍好起来。去年，启珠玛一家产粮食2.45万公斤。今年可望超过去年的收成。
    启珠玛带着全家人抓农副业生产，年年完成商品粮合同定购任务。1987年，全家交售商品粮5000多公斤，去年交售1万公斤，今年将交售1.25万公斤。去年，全家总收入为3.5万元，纯收入达到1.5万元；收获的3500公斤小麦种籽已有一半被当地群众换走。
    当我问起今后的打算，启珠玛想了想说：“民主改革前，我们一家人沿路讨饭来到许木，吃了上顿没下顿。没有共产党，我们摆脱不了苦日子。今天，我们能富起来，靠的是共产党的富民政策。今后我的目标是继续下功夫抓生产，多为国家作贡献。”　（苏润生）
