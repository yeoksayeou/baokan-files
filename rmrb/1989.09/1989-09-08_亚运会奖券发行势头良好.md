The public sale of the Eleventh Asian Games lottery tickets has been going on for a full month. The reporter recently learned from the fundraising department of the Asian Games that the sale of the lottery tickets has received strong support from all sectors of society, and the supply has been unable to meet the demand.

According to relevant personnel, the first batch of 20 million lottery tickets that were publicly issued were all sold out before they even reached the warehouse. Various enterprises and institutions have enthusiastically taken on the task of selling the lottery tickets. The general public in Beijing has also actively purchased the Asian Games lottery tickets. Among the 14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have issued lottery tickets so far, Beijing has the best sales. In the first month, Beijing alone issued 7 million lottery tickets. The reason why the Asian Games lottery tickets are popular among the masses is, first of all, the general public has realized that buying lottery tickets is a way to support the Asian Games being held in Beijing. Secondly, the design of the lottery tickets is exquisite and unique, with the 34 different designs of the first batch of tickets being particularly distinctive, having both commemorative and collectible value.

The relevant departments of the Asian Games are seriously summarizing the experiences of the past period and will further improve the sale of lottery tickets in the future, striving to complete the goal of raising 120 million yuan through lottery tickets as soon as possible.

    亚运会奖券发行势头良好
    本报北京9月8日讯　记者吴骅报道：第十一届亚运会基金奖券公开发行已整整一个月了。记者日前从亚运会集资部了解到，奖券的发行得到了社会各方面的大力支持，发行工作一直处于供不应求的局面。
    据有关人士介绍，首批公开发行的2000万张奖券没有入库就全部被批发出去。各企事业单位踊跃承担奖券发行工作，广大北京市市民也积极购买亚运会基金奖券，在目前已发行奖券的全国14个省、市、区中，北京市奖券发行情况最好。第一个月，仅北京市就发行700万张奖券。亚运会基金奖券之所以受到群众欢迎，首先是广大群众认识到购买奖券就是支持亚运会在北京举行，其次是奖券设计精美别致，首批发行的34个券头图案别具一格，有纪念和收藏价值。
    亚运会有关部门正在认真总结前一段的经验，进一步搞好下面的奖券发行工作，力争尽早完成奖券集资1.2亿元的目标。
