People's Daily, Guizhou, September 17th. According to a report by our reporter Hu Yueping, Guizhou Province has decided to implement a poverty alleviation "Food Security Program" in 31 impoverished counties across the province. Starting this autumn, the program will provide comprehensive services including funds, technology, plastic film, fertilizer, and high-quality seeds. The plan is to promote the cultivation of 200 million mu (approximately 13.3 million hectares) of hybrid rice and 200 million mu of hybrid corn. Upon completion of this food security program, relevant departments estimate that it will increase grain production by approximately 3.7 billion kilograms, adding about 400 million yuan in output value, thereby helping impoverished regions to quickly resolve food security issues.

It is understood that Guizhou Province has allocated 74 million yuan from various funding sources, including special loans for poverty alleviation and loans for ethnic minorities, as matching funds for the implementation of the "Food Security Program." The province has also organized the supply of agricultural film, fertilizer, and high-quality seeds, which will be distributed to the counties according to the planned areas for promotion in the near future.
