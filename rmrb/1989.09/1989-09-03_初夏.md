Early Summer

Pale blue and green.

Wind, dreams, and the free-flowing waves. The sunlight is warm, perhaps with a few clouds? What does it matter? Tomorrow will be even brighter, warmer, and more radiant.

Early summer is beautiful.

Girls, who have been covered by the harsh winter snow and frost, and blown by the robust spring winds, shedding their bulkiness, fatigue, and dull complexion, suddenly become slender and elegant, bright and vibrant, walking with a lightness like the wind and swallows.

From the deep blue sky emerges the first white cloud; from the fields blooms the first tender green smile, and from the willows hanging like smoke and mist over the lake, the girls joyfully watch the sky, earth, and people. They often pay attention to the temperature changes, excited about wearing their first dresses.

One of them. Always the first, she wears a pure white dress, floating and scattering, with a narrow blue belt around her waist. Her graceful figure embodies the spirit of all things, and she floats towards people from afar under the tree canopy.

Early summer is sweet.

It rains. The early summer rain is gentle and restrained. It seems to know the thirst of the young and the old who have become young again, and it seems to understand the city, the crowded rooms, and the crowded people's love. Early summer rain, with delicate hands lightly raised, invites loving couples into its embrace.

The stone benches are smooth, the trees are quiet. There are also paths, embankments, slopes in the park, and the moist soil by the lake… Many touching stories begin here, and many eternal loves are born here.

Early summer also has its sadness.

The days are longer, but life is not full. The temperature rises, but there is still so much coldness among the people. Outside the window, there is more noise and bustle, and at the desk, there is more loneliness and fatigue. When a girl's heart awakens but is constrained by her parents; when a lonely soul, through the thin rain curtain, painfully watches the colorful lovers… Early summer is tinged with a faint sadness.

Early summer is still early summer.

Everything is meaningful and full of hope. It inherits the romantic and free nature of spring, firmly foreshadowing the fiery heat of midsummer and the lushness of late autumn.

    初夏
    周雅麟
    淡蓝碧绿。
    风、梦，还有自由自在的浪花。阳光暖暖的，或许，有几朵云彩？那有什么呢，明天会更明媚，更温馨，更灿烂。
    初夏是美丽的。
    少女们被冬的严寒霜雪层层叠叠遮掩过，被春天那雄浑粗犷的风吹啊吹，吹去了臃肿，吹去了倦怠，吹去了灰黄的肤色，霎时，她们窈窕清秀，明丽鲜艳，走起路来，身轻如风如燕。
    从湛蓝的天托出第一朵洁白的云；从原野绽开第一个嫩绿色恬静的微笑，从那如烟似雾的垂柳在湖面轻拂，少女们就欣喜地注视着天、地和人们，她们常常关心气温的升降，为第一次裙装激动不已。
    一个她。总是最早最早，穿上一袭纯白的连衣裙，飘飘洒洒，腰间有窄窄的淡蓝，那优雅自然的倩影凝结着万物之灵气，她在树冠下远远的、远远的向人们飘来。
    初夏是甜蜜的。
    下雨了。初夏的雨很温存很含蓄。仿佛知道年轻的和年老了又年轻了的焦渴的心，仿佛理解了城市，那拥挤的房间里拥挤的人们的爱。初夏的雨呵，素手轻扬，招呼相亲相爱的人们到她的怀抱里来。
    石凳光洁，树丛宁静。还有小道，还有长堤，还有公园里的山坡，还有湖畔温润的细土……多少动人的故事就从这里开始，多少永久的爱情就从这里诞生。
    初夏当然也有忧郁。
    白天拉长了，日子却不丰满，气温升高了，人群中还有那么多冰冷。窗外添了些喧嚣热闹，案前多了点寂寞和困感。当女孩情窦初开又无奈于父辈的约束；当一个孤独的灵魂透过薄薄雨帘痛苦地注视缤纷的恋人们……初夏就蒙上淡淡的忧郁。
    初夏毕竟是初夏。
    一切都意味深长，充满希望。它秉承了春天浪漫自由的天性，坚韧地预示着盛夏的火热、深秋的茂盛。
