Three years ago, the Yingkou Special Oils Factory had only 60-plus employees and fixed assets worth 300,000 yuan. Its annual output value was a mere 480,000 yuan, with profits and taxes amounting to less than 800,000 yuan. Due to a single product line and poor sales, the factory's future once looked bleak. However, in 1986, the factory embarked on the "Spark Program" project for the series production of synthetic automobile brake fluid. The factory's vitality surged: over three years, it produced more than 3,000 tons of automobile brake fluid, achieving an output value of 18 million yuan and profits and taxes of 6.3 million yuan. The product covers over 50% of the domestic market, and the factory has seen two consecutive years of per capita benefits exceeding 10,000 yuan each year.

Similar "Spark Program" projects, which have transformed entire factories and towns, have been implemented in urban and rural areas across Liaoning since 1986. A total of 458 projects have been arranged so far. To date, these projects have cumulatively increased output value by 1.19 billion yuan, profits and taxes by 312 million yuan, and saved (and created) foreign exchange worth 63.1 million yuan. The input-output ratio has reached 1:4, and the input-tax ratio exceeds 1:1.5.

    “星火”正旺
    3年前，只有60多名职工、3万元固定资产的营口市特种油品厂，年产值仅48万元，利税不足8万元，而且由于产品单一、销路不畅，企业前景一度渺茫。可是，1986年上了“星火计划”项目系列合成汽车制动液产品，工厂的活力剧增：3年共生产汽车制动液3000余吨，创产值1800万元，利税630万元，产品覆盖国内市场50％以上，全厂连续两年人均效益超万元……
    类似使一厂一乡发生巨变的“星火计划”项目，1986年在辽宁城乡各地点燃以来，已先后安排458项。迄今已累计增加产值11.9亿元，利税3.12亿元，节（创）汇6310万元。投入产出比达1∶4，投入利税比达1∶1.5以上。
