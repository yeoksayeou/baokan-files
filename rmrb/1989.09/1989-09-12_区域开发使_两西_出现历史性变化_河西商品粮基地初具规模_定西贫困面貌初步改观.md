After 10 years of rural reform and 6 years of development, significant changes have taken place in the "Two Wests" regions of Gansu. Today, along the 1,000-kilometer-long Hexi Corridor, the commercial grain base is taking shape; in the central arid region represented by Dingxi, the impoverished landscape has begun to improve, and agricultural ecology is starting to enter a virtuous cycle.

According to data from the provincial "Two Wests" construction command center, in 1988 compared to 1982, the total grain production in Hexi increased from 1.715 billion kilograms to 2 billion kilograms, the total agricultural output value increased from 1.023 billion yuan to 1.564 billion yuan, and the per capita net income of farmers increased from 223 yuan to 445 yuan. In the central region, the total grain production increased from 800 million kilograms to 1.375 billion kilograms, the total agricultural output value increased from 636 million yuan to 1.188 billion yuan, and the per capita net income of farmers increased from 72 yuan to 280 yuan. In 1989, the "Two Wests" had another bumper harvest.

The Hexi Corridor is rich in water and soil resources, providing excellent conditions for agricultural development. The central region, represented by Dingxi, is arid and barren, known as the "most bitter place under heaven." Under the care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, since 1983, the "Two Wests," which account for 75.9% of the province's land area, have been listed as national key support regions for agricultural regional development. The State Council's "Three Wests" Construction Leading Group has set the correct agricultural development policy for the "Two Wests," providing continuous specific guidance and assistance. The provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have proposed the short-term goal of "stopping destruction in three years and solving the problem of hunger in five years." They have organized comprehensive agricultural development in the "Two Wests," focusing on improving agricultural production conditions, promoting practical technologies, and developing economic cooperation. This has led the 8 million people in the "Two Wests" to take solid steps to change their backward situation. In Hexi, through water conservancy projects, the effective irrigation area has been expanded, and through sand control and afforestation, oases have been created. Now, 70% of the farmland has been transformed into a network of forests, promoting the improvement of production levels. Currently, Hexi provides 7.5 billion kilograms of commercial grain annually, accounting for 70% of the province's commercial grain. In the central arid mountainous region, measures such as building terraces, dams, and sand fields, planting grass and trees, treating small watersheds, and storing water in pits have been taken to change the landscape. Through migration and labor export, efforts have been made to alleviate poverty, reducing the poverty rate from 75% to 21%, and ensuring that 3 million farmers have basically solved the problem of hunger in normal years.

In the construction of the "Two Wests," the promotion of practical technologies and the development of economic cooperation have injected vitality into agricultural development, promoting the overall development of the rural economy. Currently, in the "Two Wests," a number of commercial bases for fruits, vegetables, sugar crops, beer raw materials, oil crops, potatoes, and legumes with local characteristics are taking shape. Some famous and special products have entered the export and foreign exchange earnings list. The commercial livestock industry is developing rapidly, with the total meat production increasing by 1.4 times in six years. The numerous township enterprises are becoming the main force in revitalizing the rural economy of the "Two Wests," providing tax revenue to the state that is 1.6 times the agricultural tax of the same period.

　　区域开发使“两西”出现历史性变化
    河西商品粮基地初具规模　定西贫困面貌初步改观
    经过10年农村改革和6年开发建设，甘肃“两西”地区出现了历史性变化。如今，在绵延1000多公里的河西走廊，商品粮基地建设已经初具规模；在以定西为代表的中部干旱地区，贫困面貌已经初步改观，农业生态开始走上良性循环。
    据省“两西”建设指挥部提供的资料，1988年与1982年相比，河西粮食总产量由17.15亿公斤上升到20亿公斤，农业总产值由10.23亿元上升到15.64亿元，农民人均纯收入由223元增加到445元；中部地区粮食总产量由8亿公斤上升到13.75亿公斤，农业总产值由6.36亿元上升到11.88亿元，农民人均纯收入由72元增加到280元。1989年，“两西”又是一个丰收年。
    河西走廊水土资源丰富，具有良好的农业开发条件；以定西为代表的中部地区干旱、贫瘠，以“苦甲天下”而闻名。在党中央、国务院的关怀下，从1983年起，占全省土地面积75.9％的“两西”被列为国家专项扶持地区，实施农业区域性开发。国务院“三西”建设领导小组为“两西”确定了正确的农业建设方针，不断给予具体的指导帮助。省委、省政府提出了“三年停止破坏、五年解决温饱”的近期奋斗目标，在“两西”组织开展了以改变农业生产条件为主体，以推广实用技术、发展经济协作为两翼的农业综合开发，带领“两西”800万人民迈出了改变落后面貌的坚实步伐。在河西，通过兴修水利扩大有效灌溉面积，通过封沙育林建绿洲，使70％的农田实现了林网化，促进了生产水平的提高。现在，河西每年提供商品粮7.5亿公斤，占全省商品粮的70％。在中部干旱山区，采取兴修“三田”（梯田、坝地、砂田）和种草种树、治理小流域、打窖蓄水等措施改变面貌，通过移民和劳务输出等办法努力治穷，从而使贫困面由75％缩小到21％，有300万农民在正常年景下基本解决了温饱。
    在“两西”建设中，大力推广实用技术、发展经济协作，为农业开发增添了活力，促进了农村经济的全面发展。目前，在“两西”，瓜果、蔬菜、糖料、啤酒原料、油料、洋芋、豆类等一批具有地方特色的商品基地正在形成，一些名优特产品跃入了出口创汇行列；商品畜牧业正在迅速发展，肉类总产量6年中增长了1.4倍；星罗棋布的乡镇企业正在成为振兴“两西”农村经济的生力军，为国家提供的税收已占同期农业税的1.6倍。
