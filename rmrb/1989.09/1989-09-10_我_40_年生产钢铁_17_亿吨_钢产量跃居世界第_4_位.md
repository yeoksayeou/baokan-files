By the end of August this year, China's steel industry had cumulatively produced 1.7 billion tons of steel and iron. These steel and iron products have armed our national defense and provided a solid material foundation for the development of the national economy. After 40 years of development, China's steel production has risen from the 26th position in the world at the founding of the People's Republic to the 4th position today.

China's steel industry has risen from the ruins. In 1949, the national steel production was only 158,000 tons. Through the selfless efforts of the first generation of steel workers in New China, the national steel production reached 1.35 million tons in 1952. In the following 20 years, due to various reasons, by 1976, the production had only reached over 20 million tons.

The past decade of reform and opening up has been the most brilliant chapter in the history of China's steel industry. Although the annual growth rate of steel industry production value and steel production was only about 7%, the annual growth rate of realized profits and taxes was about twice that of production value and production. Steel production increased from 31.78 million tons per year to 59.22 million tons, an increase of 27.44 million tons.

### 我40年生产钢铁17亿吨　钢产量跃居世界第4位

　　我40年生产钢铁17亿吨
　　钢产量跃居世界第4位
    据新华社北京电　（记者孙杰）到今年8月底，新中国的钢铁工业已累计生产钢和铁17亿吨。这些钢铁武装了我国的国防，也为国民经济发展提供了雄厚的物质基础。经过40年的发展，我国的钢产量已由建国初的世界第26位跃居现在的第4位。
    新中国的钢铁工业是从满目疮痍的废墟上发展起来的。1949年，全国钢产量只有15.8万吨。经过新中国第一代钢铁工人的忘我劳动，1952年全国钢产量就上升到135万吨。这以后的20多年间，由于种种原因，到1976年，产量只达到2000多万吨。
    十年改革开放，是我国钢铁工业履历中最光彩的一页。钢铁工业产值和钢产量年均递增速度虽然只有7％左右，而实现利税的年递增速度却高出产值和产量的一倍左右，钢产量从年产3178万吨增到5922万吨，净增2744万吨。
