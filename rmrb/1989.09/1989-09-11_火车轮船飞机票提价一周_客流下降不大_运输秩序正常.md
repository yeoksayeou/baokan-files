Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 11th.

Today marks the seventh day since the price increase for train, ship, and airplane tickets. Statistics from relevant departments show that passenger flow has decreased slightly, and transportation order remains normal. Passengers have reflected that the conditions for traveling by train or ship have improved.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, from September 5th to 10th, the daily average number of passengers sent was over 2.7 million, including 430,000 long-distance passengers. These numbers are respectively 600,000 and 100,000 fewer than the same period last year, representing an 18% decrease. The phenomenon of overcrowded trains has eased somewhat. However, trains that were originally overcrowded and only ran once a day, such as Beijing to Kunming and Beijing to Chengdu, still have overcrowding issues. The Ministry of Railways has stipulated that the starting stations must sell tickets according to the designated capacity. Train tickets are still difficult to obtain.

Statistics from Shanghai, Dalian, Ningbo, and other ports indicate that passenger flow on various routes has decreased by more than 10%. Some routes, such as Shanghai to Wenzhou, although the price increase is relatively high, many passengers still report being unable to buy tickets. A transportation department official introduced that based on past experience, passenger flow will rise again after a transitional period.

Due to the fact that the 71 tourist hotlines of the Civil Aviation Administration will continue to implement the original discounted ticket prices this year, passenger flow has fluctuated very little. In some northwestern routes that have increased prices, such as Xi'an to Shenyang and Xi'an to Yan'an, the seat occupancy rate is over 90%. The tourist hotlines that experienced a significant drop in passenger flow in June and July have seen the seat occupancy rate rise to 82.4% in August, which is better than originally expected.

The transportation departments have taken the opportunity of the price increase to actively update service facilities, improve service quality, and improve the environment for traveling by train or ship, which has been praised by passengers. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau has organized various ships to deliver tea and meals to the cabins, providing 42 free or low-cost items, and directly picking up and dropping off passengers at the waiting room. From September 5th to 10th, they received over 4,500 letters of praise from various passengers.

　　火车轮船飞机票提价一周
　　客流下降不大
　　运输秩序正常
    新华社北京9月11日电　（记者李玫）今天是火车、轮船、飞机客票提价的第7天。各有关部门的统计数字表明：客流量下降不大，运输秩序正常。旅客们反映乘车船条件有所改善。
    据铁道部的统计，5日至10日，日均发送旅客270余万人，其中长途客流43万多人，分别比去年同期减少60万和10万人，下降幅度为18％左右。列车超员现象有所缓和。但原来超员严重、每天只发一次的长途列车如北京—昆明、北京—成都等仍有超员现象。铁道部已规定始发站必须按定员售票。火车票仍然不好买。
    来自上海、大连、宁波等港的统计，各航班客流下降10％多。有些轮次，如上海—温州线，虽然涨价幅度较高，许多旅客仍反映买不到票。交通部人士介绍，据以往的经验，客流将在一段过渡期后回升。
    由于民航71条旅游热线今年内仍实行原定的优惠票价，客流量波动很小。西北一些提价的航线，如西安—沈阳、西安—延安等，客座率高达90％以上。6、7月份客流严重下跌的各旅游热线，8月份客座率已回升至82.4％，比原来预计得要好。
    交通运输部门借提价之机积极更新服务设施，提高服务质量，改善乘车（船）环境，受到旅客好评。上海海运局组织各船送茶、送饭到客舱，提供免费或低费项目42个，并到候船室直接接送旅客。5—10日共收到各类旅客表扬信4500余件。
