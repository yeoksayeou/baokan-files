40 years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, after decades of bloody struggle, overthrew the three mountains of oppression, and the humiliated Chinese people stood up. New China, like a rising sun, emerged in the East. Jilin Province, this borderland that has suffered much hardship, like other provinces and cities, began its great journey of revival. In the blink of an eye, 40 years have passed. "Spring rain adds flowers, and flowers move a mountain of spring color." Under the leadership of the Party, the 23 million people of various ethnic groups in Jilin Province have worked tirelessly and striven for excellence in politics, economy, science, culture, education, and social affairs, achieving fruitful results in socialist construction. The total social output value, total industrial and agricultural output value, and national income of the province have increased by nearly 38 times, 25 times, and 19 times respectively compared to the early days of the founding of the nation. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reform and opening up have brought unprecedented profound changes to the province. The national income has doubled more than twice, fiscal revenue has increased by 2.7 times, and the per capita income of urban and rural residents has increased by 2.3 times. Agriculture has broken away from its long-term stagnation, and grain production has continuously reached new heights. At present, the total production, export, and transfer of corn are all ranked first in the country; the industry has developed steadily at an average annual growth rate of 11.7%; science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings have made significant progress; people's lives have improved significantly; and the economic and cultural construction of ethnic minority areas such as Yanbian is vibrant and the situation is improving day by day. Over the past 40 years, we have experienced many twists and turns, but the moon and sun may be eclipsed, but their brilliance cannot be extinguished. The great achievements, profound changes, and historical comparisons all make people more firmly believe that without the Communist Party, there would be no new China; only socialism can develop China.

Our republic has entered its forties. All the achievements and hardships of the past are left behind as history; what we face is a more magnificent, more arduous, and more exciting new battle journey.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping has long proposed the strategic vision of China's socialist modernization in three steps, and the Thirteenth Party Congress has given a profound interpretation of this. Recently, Comrade Xiaoping once again pointed out that our development strategy of "three steps" is correct. In this overall strategic vision, Jilin Province, as a border and coastal province, and as an important base for commodity grain, automobiles, petrochemicals, forestry, and scientific research in the country, has a special mission. Starting from the reality of Jilin Province, the strategic thinking of the overall development of economy, science, and society is: deepen reform, connect the south and expand the north, focus on efficiency, prioritize science and technology, adjust the structure, strengthen management, focus on breakthroughs, and revitalize the whole province. After more than ten years of unremitting efforts, by the end of this century, we will achieve the goal of doubling the total industrial and agricultural output value and national income based on 1980, with the per capita national income exceeding 1900 yuan. We will strive to build Jilin well and contribute to the socialist modernization construction of the whole country.

To achieve our strategic goals, the most important thing is stability. Reviewing the 40-year history, especially the experience of the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil and the Beijing counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred three months ago, makes us feel more deeply the extreme importance of stability for socialist modernization construction. Instability cannot lead to development, and turmoil can only bring disaster. To maintain stability, the most fundamental thing is to firmly adhere to the basic line of "one center and two basic points" at any time, and resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The economy is the foundation, and "the people's livelihood lies in abundance." Ultimately, we must develop the economy. At the same time, we must take the four cardinal principles as the basis, strengthen the Party's construction, clean government construction, and socialist spiritual civilization construction in the process of reform and opening up. We must adhere to the fundamental principles of the state and walk the path to a strong country.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "People must have some spirit." To implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and to achieve our great goals, what do we rely on? We rely on people, on their ideals, awareness, and aspirations. In a certain sense, the development history of New China can be said to be a history of carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and pioneering innovation under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Now, we are at the starting point of the second step of the "three steps." The task of rectification and adjustment is very arduous. There are many favorable conditions, but we also face various difficulties and new challenges. At this critical moment, we must have great aspirations, revitalize the revolutionary spirit, and strive forward in unity.

Currently, the turmoil has passed, and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is being deeply implemented across the country. We are determined, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary, to unite the people of the whole province and strive together towards the goals of prosperity, democracy, and civilization. We will strive to build Jilin Province better and add luster to the Socialist Republic of China.

    团结奋斗  建设吉林
    中共吉林省委书记　何竹康
    40年前，在中国共产党的带领下，中国人民经过几十年的浴血奋战，推翻了罪恶深重的“三座大山”，屈辱的中国人民站了起来，新中国如一轮红日在世界的东方喷薄而出，吉林省这片饱经苦难的边陲之地，如兄弟省市一样开始了伟大复兴的历程。弹指40年过去，“春路雨添花，花动一山春色”，白山之下，松水之滨，吉林省2300多万各族人民在党的领导下，艰苦奋斗，励精图治，在政治、经济、科学、文化、教育、社会事业等各个领域取得了社会主义建设的丰硕成果。全省社会总产值、工农业总产值、国民生产总值比建国初期分别增长近38倍、25倍和19倍。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，改革开放使全省面貌发生了前所未有的深刻变化，国民生产总值翻了两番多，财政收入增长2.7倍，城乡居民人均收入增长2.3倍，农业结束了长期徘徊的局面，粮食生产连续攀登新的台阶。目前，玉米总产量、出口量、调出量均居全国首位；工业以平均年递增11.7％的速度持续稳定发展；科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业都有了长足的进步；人民生活有了很大改善；延边等少数民族地区的经济文化建设生机蓬勃，气象日新。40年间我们经历了几多曲折，但日月有蚀不泯其光辉。巨大的成就，深刻的变化，历史的比较，不能不使人民愈加坚定一个信念：没有共产党就没有新中国；只有社会主义才能发展中国。
    我们的共和国已步入不惑之年。过去的一切成就和经历的一切艰辛，都作为历史留在了身后；我们面临的，是更加宏伟、更加艰巨也更加激动人心的新的战斗征程。
    邓小平同志早就提出了我国社会主义现代化分三步走的战略构想，党的十三大对此作了精辟的阐释。最近，小平同志又一次指出，我们这个发展战略的“三步曲”是正确的。在这个全局性的战略构想中，吉林省作为边疆近海省，作为国家重要的商品粮、汽车、石油化工、林业和科研基地，负有特别的使命。从吉林省情的实际出发，经济科技社会总体发展的战略思想是：深化改革，南联北拓，注重效益，科技先行，调整结构，加强管理，重点突破，全面振兴。要经过十几年的坚持不懈的努力，到本世纪末实现工农业总产值和国民生产总值在1980年的基础上翻两番以上，人均国民生产总值超过1900元。我们要努力把吉林建设好，为全国的社会主义现代化建设做贡献。
    实现我们的战略目标，最重要的是稳定。回顾40年历史，特别是经历了3个月前发生的反党反社会主义动乱和北京反革命暴乱，更使我们深感稳定对于社会主义现代化建设的极端重要性。不稳定不能发展，动乱只能带来灾难。保持稳定，最根本的是在任何时候我们都要坚定不移地坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，坚决贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神。经济是基础，“安民在于足用”，归根到底要把经济搞上去。同时，要以四项基本原则为基点，在改革开放中加强党的建设、廉政建设和社会主义精神文明建设。坚持立国之本，走好强国之路。
    毛泽东同志早就说过，“人总是要有一点精神的。”贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，实现我们宏伟的奋斗目标，靠什么？靠人，靠人的理想、觉悟和志气。新中国的发展史，在某种意义上可以说，就是在马列主义、毛泽东思想指引下，发扬艰苦奋斗、开拓创业的革命精神的历史。现在，我们正处在“三步曲”第二步的起点上，治理整顿的任务非常艰巨，既有许多有利条件，也面临着种种困难和新的挑战。在这样的关键时刻，我们更要有大志气，重振革命精神，团结奋进。
    当前，动乱的风波已经过去，党的十三届四中全会精神正在各地得到深入贯彻。我们决心在以江泽民同志为总书记的党中央的正确领导下，团结全省人民共同努力，向着富强、民主、文明的目标一往直前，努力把吉林省建设得更好，为社会主义的人民共和国增添光彩。
