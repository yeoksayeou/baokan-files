Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

The ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this afternoon and this morning, during which some members spoke on issues related to further improving the rectification and deepening reform.

Wan Li, the Chairman, attended the meeting. Ni Zhifu and Fei Xiaotong, Vice Chairmen, presided over the meeting respectively.

Commissioner Ye Lin suggested that the State Council, while focusing on current work, should start formulating a plan for the next two to three years of rectification and deepening reform. He proposed taking more decisive measures and using economic, administrative, and legal means to strengthen macro-control capabilities, reverse the difficult situation, and create conditions for the national economy to enter a virtuous cycle.

Commissioner Zhang Gen-sheng, on behalf of Commissioners Li Ruishan and Yang Lifeng, stated in a joint speech that, overall, the stagnation in agriculture has not been fundamentally broken through, and agriculture remains a prominent weak link in the national economy. They suggested that during the rectification and economic adjustment, agriculture should be prioritized, and agricultural productivity should be vigorously developed. They emphasized the importance of strengthening agricultural research and technology promotion, perfecting and deepening rural reforms, and continuing to adhere to the basic policies of rural reform. They also suggested that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should strengthen supervision and legislation regarding agriculture.

Commissioner Zhang Ting suggested concentrating financial and material resources to focus on large and medium-sized enterprises that have a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. He proposed adjusting the economic and industrial structures, formulating policies to support these enterprises, ensuring the supply of raw materials and energy, and directing funds towards them. He also emphasized the role of industrial workers and technical personnel, advocating for their full involvement and enthusiasm.

Commissioner Chen Shun-heng stated that after the handling of the five major companies was announced, people were both satisfied and dissatisfied. The satisfaction came from the fact that illegal activities were uncovered, illegal gains were confiscated, and fines were imposed. The dissatisfaction stemmed from the fact that the responsible individuals for the illegal and disciplinary actions were still being processed, and the public was awaiting the outcome. The audit work on the five major companies lasted 10 months, revealing numerous illegal activities. He questioned whether there was any abuse of power, bribery, or corruption, and if so, who was involved and in which units. He emphasized the need for transparency and equality before the law, regardless of who was involved.

Commissioner Yang Lieyu believed that China's 10-year reform in the education sector has achieved significant results but also needs to address some long-standing issues. He suggested that the State Council and local governments should align the development of school education with economic construction and use this as a primary indicator for evaluating officials' performance. He also proposed quickly formulating and implementing plans to improve the wages and living conditions of teachers at all levels. He advocated for widespread publicity of departments, regions, units, and individuals that prioritize education, fostering a culture of valuing education. He suggested summarizing and implementing the experiences from the central government's decisions on educational system reforms and the Compulsory Education Law. He also proposed reforming the teacher evaluation system and revising the setup of disciplines and majors in universities.

Commissioner Li Xuezhi believed that Zhao Ziyang's serious mistakes in economic work, although discovered early, were delayed in resolution, largely due to his violation of the principle of democratic centralism, which disrupted the political life of the Party and the state. He ignored the voices and supervision of the people, losing effective internal and external supervision. Deng Xiaoping's important article on supervision has far-reaching significance. Exercising the supervisory role of the National People's Congress is the greatest support and assistance to the government. Premier Li Peng took the criticisms and suggestions from the commissioners regarding the cleanup of companies very seriously, promptly issuing instructions and decisions, which is a strong support for the supervision of the National People's Congress.

Commissioner Ma Wanqi stated that the most important task at present is to strictly control price increases, which is a major issue affecting economic stability and social harmony. This work must not be relaxed and should be overseen by a dedicated department. In financial matters, it should align with the state budget approved by the National People's Congress, treating it with seriousness and responsibility.

Commissioner Duan Suquan stated that there is strong public sentiment against unfair distribution. To eliminate this phenomenon, it is necessary to adhere to the principles of socialist equality, ensure equality before the law within the framework of the Constitution and laws, promote social justice, and protect the legal rights of the people to the greatest extent, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the entire nation.

Vice Chairman Rong Yiren, in his speech, welcomed the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the deputies to inspect the work of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC). He said that everyone is currently concerned about the rectification and cleanup of the "five major companies," including CITIC. The National Audit Office, following the instructions of the State Council, began auditing the company's financial and operational activities from late October last year and published the audit results and decisions in the newspapers. As the person in charge of CITIC, he hoped that the audit department would conduct an annual audit of the company's business activities to strengthen supervision. He also welcomed criticism and suggestions from all sectors of society to help improve the company's work.

Other commissioners who spoke at the meeting included Wang Jinling, Yang Kang, Li Guiying, Wu Dakun, Xu Yunbei, Mo Wenxiang, Zhang Ken, and others who submitted written speeches.

    人大常委会举行大会发言
    委员就进一步搞好治理整顿深化改革发表意见
    据新华社北京9月4日电　七届全国人大常委会第九次会议2日下午和今天上午举行大会发言，一些委员就有关进一步搞好治理整顿和深化改革等问题发表了意见。
    万里委员长出席了会议，倪志福、费孝通副委员长分别主持了会议。
    叶林委员建议国务院在抓好当前工作的同时，着手制定今后两三年治理整顿和深化改革的规划，采取更加坚决果断的措施，运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，加强宏观调控能力，扭转困难局面，为国民经济转向良性循环创造条件。
    张根生委员代表李瑞山、杨立功等委员作的联合发言中认为，从总体上说，农业徘徊的局面还没有根本突破，农业仍是国民经济中突出的薄弱环节。他们建议，在治理整顿和经济调整中，必须把加强农业放在首位，大力发展农业生产力；要把加强农业科研和技术推广工作放在最重要的地位；完善和深化农村改革，继续坚持农村改革的基本政策；人大常委会要加强对农业的监督和立法。
    张挺委员建议相对地集中一定的财力、物力，把重点放在国计民生有重大影响的大中型企业，逐步调整经济结构、产业结构；制定政策，向大中型企业倾斜，保证这些企业计划的原材料能源供应、资金投向；发挥产业工人、技术人员的骨干作用，充分调动他们的积极性。
    陈邃衡委员说，这次对五大公司的处理公布后，人们既满意又不满意。满意的是终于查出了违法事实，没收了非法所得，并处以罚款。不满意的是，对违法违纪的责任人员只是正在处理中，如何处理，群众正拭目以待。五大公司的审计工作达10个月之久，既已查出不少违法事实，有没有以权谋私？有没有行贿受贿、贪赃枉法？如果有，涉及哪些人和单位？是否真正做到谁有问题就查谁而且一查到底，在法律面前人人平等？这是群众所关心的。我们应该把违法违纪案件的犯罪事实以及依法处理情况，不管涉及到谁，原原本本地公开揭露，公之于众。
    杨烈宇委员认为，我国10年改革在教育战线上取得了很大成绩，但也需要解决一些存在已久的问题。建议国务院和各级政府在观念上要把学校教育事业的发展与经济建设同步进行，并以此作为考核干部政绩的首要指标；尽快拿出改善各级教师工资及生活待遇等方面的切实方案并尽早出台实施；大张旗鼓地宣传对教育事业重视的部门、地区、单位、个人，使重视教育蔚然成风；加紧总结贯彻执行中央关于教育体制改革决定和义务教育法颁布以来的经验；改革各级学校教师职称评审制度；对高校学科专业设置等进行重新修订。
    李学智委员认为，赵紫阳同志在经济工作中的严重失误虽早已发现，但却久拖不决，很重要的一个原因就是他违背了民主集中制原则，破坏了党和国家的政治生活。他对人民的呼声、监督视而不见，充耳不闻，失去了党内外有效的监督。邓小平同志关于监督的重要文章意义深远。发挥人大监督作用，是对政府最大支持帮助。李鹏总理对这次委员们关于清理整顿公司的批评建议非常重视，及时作了批示和决定，这是对人大监督的有力支持。
    马万祺委员说，目前最主要的是严格控制物价上涨，这是关系稳定经济、安定社会的主要大事，此项工作决不能松口，应有专责部门把关。财经上要配合，只能按人大批准的国家预算执行，应该以严肃和负责的态度来对待人大批准的预算。
    段苏权委员说，当前群众对分配不公反映强烈，为消除这一现象，就要坚持社会主义平等的原则，在宪法和法律规定的范围内，实行法律面前人人平等，提倡社会公正，最大限度地保护人民的合法权益，调动全国人民的积极性。
    荣毅仁副委员长在发言中表示，欢迎人大常委会委员和人大代表对中信公司的工作进行检查。他说，现在大家都很关注“五大公司”的清理整顿情况，这其中也包括我们中信公司。国家审计署根据国务院的指示，从去年10月下旬开始对我们公司的财务收支等有关经营活动进行了审计，并在报纸上公布了审计结果和处理决定。作为中信公司的负责人，我希望今后审计部门能每年对我们公司的业务活动进行一次审计，以加强对我们工作的监督。同时，也欢迎社会各方面对我们的工作提出批评意见，帮助我们改进工作。
    在会上发言的委员还有：王金陵、杨铿、李桂英、吴大琨、徐运北，莫文祥、张忱等委员作了书面发言。
