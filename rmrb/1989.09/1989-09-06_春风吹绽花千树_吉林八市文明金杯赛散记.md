Currently, in some of the larger cities in Jilin Province, if you pay a little attention and observe a bit, and compare your past experiences with the current situation, you will definitely find that in activities such as visiting parks, shopping for grain and vegetables, taking public transportation, asking for directions, or even making a long-distance call, there have been some changes. These changes bring you more joy and less of the unclean, impolite, and uncivilized phenomena that used to make you angry.

In cities like Tonghua, Hunjiang, Siping, Liaoyuan, Yanji, and Baicheng; in systems such as commerce, grain, culture, health, public security, finance, and railways, many good deeds and practical actions that bring happiness to the people are increasing day by day.

Indeed, it is a competition, a race, and a comparison! In fact, this is a genuine contest, an important part of Jilin Province's socialist spiritual civilization construction – the Jilin Province Eight Cities Civilized Gold Cup Competition for Mass Spiritual Civilization Construction Activities.

Compare the comprehensive management of social order, public security, and urban environmental sanitation; compare the style of work and service quality of various industries; compare the joint construction of military and civilian efforts; compare the factory atmosphere, shop atmosphere, school atmosphere, street atmosphere, family atmosphere, and city atmosphere! Compare and compete, who is more civilized!

This is an unprecedented event in scale; this is also a socialist activity with spiritual connotations that no other event can match: with the fundamental goal of improving people's ideological and moral quality and cultivating "four-haves" new people, and with the aim of building a civilized city atmosphere and comprehensively improving the level of urban spiritual civilization construction!

For this reason, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to focus on this competition, because it is not only an important measure to invigorate people's spirits, cultivate good moral customs, create a good and stable social environment, and promote spiritual civilization construction, but also a great cause that is practical, in line with the people's wishes, and in line with the trend of social development.

This activity kicked off in April of this year. By next April, when the spring breeze blows over Jilin again, the outstanding performers in this competition will raise the shining gold cup!

    春风吹绽花千树
    ——吉林八市文明金杯赛散记
    于克
    眼下，在吉林省的一些较大城市里，只要你稍稍留点心，注意观察一下，并且拿你过去的经验与现在的情形做一下比较，你一定会发现，在你游园散步、买粮买菜、乘车问路，甚至打一次长途电话这样的小事情中，都有一些变化，都多多少少让你感到高兴，而少了不少曾经使你气恼的不干净、不礼貌、不文明的现象。
    在通化、在浑江、在四平、在辽源、在延吉、在白城等各个城市；在商业、粮食、文化、卫生、公安、金融、铁路等各个系统，许多好事、实事、让群众高兴的事，日渐多了起来。
    真的是争、是抢、是比呢！事实上这就是一场名副其实的竞赛，吉林省社会主义精神文明建设的一个重要组成部分——吉林省八城市群众性精神文明建设活动金杯赛。
    比一比社会治安、社会秩序和城市环境卫生的综合治理；比一比行业作风、服务质量；比一比军民共建；比一比厂风、店风、校风、街风、家风和市风！比一比，赛一赛，谁更文明！
    这是一场规模空前的赛事；这又是一次有着任何赛事都无可比拟的精神内涵的社会主义活动：以提高人的思想道德素质、培育“四有”新人为根本，以建设文明市风、全面提高城市精神文明建设水准为目标！
    为此，吉林省委、省政府下决心抓好这场赛事，因为这不仅是振奋人们精神、培养优良道德风尚、创造良好稳定的社会环境、推动精神文明建设的重要措施，而且是一件切合实际、顺乎民心、顺应社会发展潮流的大好事。
    这项活动于今年4月拉开帷幕，来年4月，当自然界的春风再度吹拂吉林大地时，这场竞赛中的佼佼者将举起闪光的金杯！
