Forty years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, finally broke free from the depths of semi-colonial and semi-feudal suffering and established their own People's Republic. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China, the China Revolutionary Museum, edited by the Cultural Relics Publishing House, has published four large historical albums: "In Memory of Mao Zedong," "In Memory of Zhou Enlai," "In Memory of Liu Shaoqi," and "In Memory of Zhu De." These albums vividly present the lives of these four elder revolutionary leaders of the proletariat, which were full of grandeur and color, and are indeed a joyous event for everyone.

Historical albums have a unique appeal that books expressed solely through text cannot replace. They are authentic, recording the past without any alterations by later generations, and can be considered historical evidence in themselves. They are vivid, allowing people to directly experience the atmosphere of the time and observe the spirit of these outstanding leaders. Opening these albums, one seems to witness in person the important historical scenes that these elders experienced in the turbulent years of war or under the white terror, and their calm, resolute, and decisive expressions. Opening these albums, one's mind is filled with the moving scenes of the early days of the founding of the nation, when they designed the blueprint for the future of New China, promoted the construction of New China, and traveled throughout the country, even to remote villages.

However, it is not an easy task to present a relatively complete picture of a great figure's life through an album. Due to the limited space in an album, the editors can only carefully select the most representative and historically valuable images from thousands of collected photographs. Many photographs were difficult to preserve, and some are being published for the first time. The editors arrange these images in chronological order, with concise textual explanations next to each image. The entire book is clear and focused, with a timeline of major events at the end, including many of the latest research findings. These three elements together sketch the general outline of the revolutionary lives of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De. At least so far, this is the most comprehensive set of albums reflecting these four main founders of New China, both domestically and internationally. This statement is probably not an exaggeration.

To highlight the inspiring images and major achievements of the four leaders, the editors have taken their lifelong pursuit of the path of China's revolution and construction as the main theme of the entire book.

During the democratic revolution period, the images focus on their unremitting efforts to overthrow the old China and build a new one. In a series of images taken shortly after the end of the Long March in northern Shaanxi, one sees these world-renowned revolutionaries with gaunt faces and simple clothing, and cannot help but recall the unimaginable hardships they endured in extremely harsh conditions. In "In Memory of Mao Zedong," the editors selected only two images for the Long March section: one of snow-covered mountains and the other of an endless expanse of marshy grasslands. These two photographs are symbolic, making readers feel as if they see the shadows of Mao Zedong's Red Army struggling through thousands of kilometers of snow-covered mountains and three hundred kilometers of muddy terrain. In "In Memory of Zhou Enlai," multiple images of Zhou Enlai calmly reading the "New China Daily" and concentrating on writing in Chongqing evoke thoughts of his wisdom and courage in staying composed and commanding in the face of danger. There are also some important historical scenes that did not leave behind photographs. The editors, with their unique creativity, made up for this through design elements. For example, in "In Memory of Zhu De," the images used to reflect the Nanchang Uprising include a martyrs' memorial tower and a revolver that Zhu De used. This deeply implies the unyielding and tenacious revolutionary spirit of Zhu De and other Communists after the failure of the Great Revolution. It also makes readers clearly realize that it was from this time that the Chinese revolution turned a new page and embarked on the path of armed seizure of power.

During the period of socialist construction, the images focus on the great achievements made by these major leaders of the Party and the state in leading the Chinese people to build a new China after its birth. The editors paid attention to reflecting this theme from multiple angles. In "In Memory of Zhou Enlai," we see Zhou Enlai calmly listening to the speeches of various representatives at the Bandung Conference in 1955 and his famous speech at the conference. In "In Memory of Liu Shaoqi," we see Liu Shaoqi, as the chairman of the republic, visiting the Great Khingan Mountains to inspect the forestry industry, which is truly moving.

　　缔造新中国的历史见证
    ——为《纪念毛泽东》等四本图册出版而作
　　金冲及
    四十年前，中国人民在共产党领导下，经过艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于从半殖民地半封建社会的苦难深渊中挣脱出来，创立了自己的人民共和国。在新中国诞生四十周年前夕，文物出版社出版的中国革命博物馆编辑的《纪念毛泽东》、《纪念周恩来》、《纪念刘少奇》、《纪念朱德》四本大型历史图册，在人们面前再现这四位老一辈无产阶级革命家波澜壮阔、绚丽多彩的一生，实在是一件令人高兴的事情。
    历史图册有着单用文字表述的书籍难以替代的特有的吸引力。它是真实的，是当时留下的记录，没有经过后人的任何改动，可以说本身就是历史的见证。它是形象的，使人能直接感受到当年的时代气氛，观察到这几位杰出领导人那时的精神风貌。打开一本本画册，人们仿佛亲眼看见在那烽火连天的战争年代或白色恐怖笼罩下的险恶环境中，这几位老人家经历的许多重要历史场面的真实情景和他们从容镇定、坚毅果断的面容。打开一本本画册，人们眼前又重新浮现出建国初期他们为设计新中国未来的蓝图，推进新中国的建设大业，走遍祖国各地直至穷乡僻壤的动人情景。
    但是，一本图册要比较完整地再现一位伟大人物的一生，并不是一件容易的事情。由于图册的篇幅总是有限的，编者只能从收集到的数以千计的图片中精心挑选出最有代表性和最具历史价值的珍贵镜头。许多照片都是很不容易才保存下来的，不少还是第一次公开发表。编者将这些图片按历史发展的线索编排成册，每一幅画面旁都有文字精炼的说明。全书脉络清晰，重点突出。书后还附有包括许多最新研究成果的大事年表。这三者浑然一体，勾画出毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、朱德革命一生的大致面貌。至少到目前为止，这是国内外反映这四位新中国主要缔造者的图册中内容最丰富的一套。这样说，大概不能算是夸张。
    为了突出四位领导人的动人形象和主要业绩，编者把他们一生中如何不停步地探索中国革命和建设的道路作为贯穿全书的主线。
    在民主革命时期，画面着重表现他们为推翻旧中国、创建新中国所作的不懈努力。在长征结束初到陕北的一组图片中，人们看到这几位举世闻名的革命家面庞清瘦、衣着简朴，不由得想起他们在极端艰苦的环境中所经历的令人难以想象的辛劳。在《纪念毛泽东》中，编者对长征部分只选了两张图片：一张是皑皑白雪覆盖的群山峻岭，一张是一望无际的布满沼泽的大草地。这两张照片富有象征意味，使读者仿佛看到毛泽东率领的红军在千余公里的雪山上和三百公里的泥泞中艰难行进的身影。在《纪念周恩来》中，多幅周恩来在重庆平静地阅读《新华日报》和凝神写作的照片，使人联想到他身居虎穴、沉着机智、指挥若定的大智大勇。还有一些重要历史场面没有留下照片。图片编者独具匠心地从画面设计等方面尽力加以弥补。如《纪念朱德》在反映南昌起义时使用的图片是一座烈士纪念塔，一把朱德用过的驳壳枪。它寓意深长地暗示出，大革命失败后朱德等共产党人不屈不挠地顽强拚搏的革命精神。也使读者清楚地意识到，正是从这个时候开始，中国革命掀开新的一页，走上了武装夺取政权的道路。
    在社会主义建设时期，画面重点突出的是新中国诞生后，这几位党和国家的主要领导人呕心沥血地领导中国人民建设新中国所取得的伟大成就。编者注意多侧面多角度地反映这一主题。在《纪念周恩来》中，我们看到周恩来在1955年万隆会议上镇定地听取各国代表发言的照片和他在会议上的著名的发言稿。在《纪念刘少奇》中，人们看到作为共和国主席的刘少奇深入大兴安岭考察林业的一组组镜头，不能不为之感动。
