Why does so much tax revenue go missing, and why do tax evaders so often get away with it? There are many reasons. Here are some examples to expose these tax evaders:

Breaking down large sums into smaller ones. A professor at a certain university created a set of educational television programs, earning a net income of 24,000 yuan. She first withdrew part of the money, leaving 10,000 yuan in the television station's account. Later, she used the excuse of being a part-time consultant to withdraw 380 yuan each month. This way, what should have been a one-time income over 800 yuan, subject to tax, became a monthly income of less than 400 yuan, thus evading taxes.

Creating fake names and falsely claiming wages. Some street-level individual business operators and supply and marketing experts have monthly incomes ranging from 600 to 800 yuan. To evade taxes, they go to great lengths to fabricate fake payrolls and falsely claim wages. For example, a street-run market actually has only about a dozen employees, but the payroll lists over 30 people. When distributing wages, the contractor pockets a large sum of money with fake stamps, while the tax authorities, when checking, find that the wages on the books do not exceed the limit.

Keeping two sets of books to deceive others. Some shop owners rent out their stores at high prices to evade taxes by signing two sets of contracts with the tenants—one official contract showing a monthly rent of less than 400 yuan, and another unofficial contract demanding a much higher rent. The tenants have no choice but to silently comply.

Holding multiple jobs to make money from various sources. Some individuals hold multiple jobs, earning money from different sources every month.

In some countries, paying taxes on time, along with labor and education, is considered one of the three major duties of citizens. For those who delay or evade taxes, tax authorities have the right to investigate, prosecutors can file lawsuits, and courts can impose sentences. Once discovered, the fines can be retroactively applied for up to seven years. In China, tax collection lacks enforcement measures. Although serious tax evaders can be sentenced to up to three years in prison, this is rarely enforced. Proposing a "strict tax law" is very reasonable.

    给逃税者曝曝光
    陈大光
    国税为何大量流失，逃税者为何屡屡得手，原因甚多。下面列举种种，给那些逃税者曝曝光：
    化整为零。某大学一位教授在电视台搞了一套电教节目，个人净收入2.4万元。她先提走一部分，剩下1万元存在电视台帐上，事后又以兼任顾问为由，每月领取380元，这样由一次性收入超800元本应上税变成月收入不超400元，逃避了税收。
    编造假名，虚分冒领。一些街道个体企业承包头和供销能人，每月实际收入都有600元—800元，为了逃避上税，他们挖空心思骗造假花名册，虚分冒领。如一家街办商场实际职工只有十几名，而在工资表上却列了30多人，每月发工资时，承包头就兜里揣上一大把手戳，多领的钱揣入腰包，而税务人员查税时，帐上的工资并没有过结。
    阴阳两帐，蒙人耳目。一些店主高价出租门市房，为逃税，就和承租人定阴阳两套合同，明里每月租金不足400元，暗中又狠要一笔。承租人只好忍气吞声暗中配合。
    身兼数职，多方捞钱。一些能人身兼数职，每月从不同单位往腰包里捞钱。
    在一些国家，依法纳税与劳动、受教育并列为国民的三大义务。对迟交或偷漏税者，税务部门有权稽查，检察机关要起诉，法院要判刑，查出后罚款额还要上追7年。我国的税收就缺乏强制手段。虽然对严重偷税者可以由法院判处三年以下徒刑，可很少执行。有识之士提出“严税法”，是很有道理的。
