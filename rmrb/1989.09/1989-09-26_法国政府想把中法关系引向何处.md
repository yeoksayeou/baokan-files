Criminal offenders Wang Xiaozhi and Wu'erkaixi, who were wanted by Chinese public security authorities for inciting and plotting counter-revolutionary riots, fled the country in fear of the law and have been conducting activities against the Chinese government and the Chinese people. Recently, they gathered their accomplices in Paris, France, to form a so-called "Democratic China Front," arrogantly declaring their intention to overthrow the Chinese government and stubbornly opposing the people. The despicable actions of Wang Xiaozhi and his gang have naturally been condemned by the Chinese people and are despised by overseas Chinese and people of conscience and justice around the world.

What is seriously noteworthy is that such a group of criminals, who openly incite and plot to overthrow the government of the People's Republic of China, has received open support from the French government. Despite repeated protests from the Chinese government, the French government insisted on allowing the "Front" to hold its so-called "founding conference" in France. The French government's actions violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, which state that no country has the right to directly or indirectly interfere in the internal affairs of another country or use its own territory to engage in activities that threaten the security of another country. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and the Chinese government and people cannot accept it.

The French government openly supports and encourages the activities of Wang Xiaozhi and his gang against the Chinese government, claiming it is for the sake of "protecting human rights." This is completely untenable. Who are Wang Xiaozhi and his gang? It is known to all that they instigated the turmoil and riots in Beijing, rallying a small number of people to use violence to attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, thereby violating Chinese criminal law. Due to the turmoil they caused, which resulted in significant loss of life and property, they were wanted by Chinese public security authorities. To escape the judgment of the Chinese people, they fled in a panic, relying on foreign shelter to continue their counter-revolutionary activities against the Chinese people. The French government, which has always claimed to strictly adhere to international law and not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, has elevated these Chinese fugitive criminals to the status of "human rights fighters," providing them with a platform to continue their activities against the Chinese government, and arrogantly justifying their actions with their own value standards and legal concepts, attempting to force China to accept them. This cannot help but make one suspect that the true intention of the French government is to support activities against the Chinese government under the pretext of protecting human rights.

Anyone without bias can see: the Chinese government is stable; the Chinese political situation is stable; we continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up, which is wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of the people. Any attempt to overthrow the People's Republic will ultimately be a pipe dream. Anyone who bets on Wang Xiaozhi and this small group of traitors to the nation is doomed to fail.

It should be seriously pointed out that since the Chinese government suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots, the French government has unilaterally taken a series of steps that harm the relationship between the two countries. In Western Europe, it was the French government that first announced the freezing of high-level contacts and other "sanctions" against China, and then supported the "Front" in Paris in its illegal activities to overthrow the Chinese government, leading to the deterioration of relations between the two countries. Under this harmful atmosphere, a series of violent terrorist activities have occurred in France in recent months, targeting Chinese diplomatic missions, and there have been incidents of harassment and infringement on the human rights of Chinese transit passengers. The Chinese Civil Aviation Representative Office and the Educational Office of the Chinese Embassy have been successively harassed, and Chinese personnel, despite holding valid visas, have been repeatedly monitored and mistreated at Paris Airport. On September 20, just before the "Front" held its meeting in Paris, a car belonging to the Chinese Embassy's Commercial Office was blown up. All of these incidents are difficult to see as isolated, accidental events. The Chinese side has done nothing wrong to France, but France has been poisoning the relationship between the two countries. One cannot help but ask: where does the French government want to lead Sino-French relations?

China is an independent and sovereign country. We will not allow any foreign government to infringe upon our sovereignty or interfere in our internal affairs. We have always advocated handling relations between countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We do not export our social and political systems to other countries, and similarly, we do not allow any country to impose their social and political systems, values, and political will on us. We hope that the French government will consider the long-term interests of the peoples of both countries, strictly adhere to the norms of international relations, and immediately stop all activities that interfere in China's internal affairs. Twenty-five years ago, the far-sighted General de Gaulle opened the door to China, laying the foundation for Sino-French friendship. The Chinese government and people have always cherished Sino-French friendship, and we do not want to see this open door closed again due to the shortsightedness and imprudence of certain individuals.

    法国政府想把中法关系引向何处
    本报评论员
    因煽动和策划反革命暴乱被我公安机关通缉的刑事罪犯严家其、吾尔开希等人，畏罪叛逃国外，大肆进行反对中国政府、反对中国人民的活动。近日，他们又在法国巴黎纠集其同伙，拼凑所谓“民主中国阵线”，狂妄叫嚣要推翻中国政府，顽固与人民为敌。严家其一伙的恶劣行径理所当然地遭到中国人民的痛斥，也为广大海外华侨华人和各国有良知和正义感的人士所不齿。
    值得严重注意的是，这样一伙明目张胆地煽动和策划颠覆中华人民共和国政府活动的刑事罪犯，却得到了法国政府的公开支持。法国政府不顾中国政府的一再交涉，坚持让“民阵”在法国举行所谓的“成立大会”。法国政府这样做，违反了联合国宪章和国际法关于任何国家无权直接或间接干涉别国内政、本国领土不得被用来进行威胁它国安全的活动的原则。这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，中国政府和中国人民决不能接受。
    法国政府这样公开地纵容和支持严家其等人反对中国政府的活动，居然还称之为什么“保护人权”，这是根本站不住脚的。严家其一伙是什么人？众所周知，是他们在北京挑起动乱和暴乱，纠集极少数人用暴力手段图谋推翻中国政府，触犯了中国的刑律。由于挑起这场暴乱造成了重大的人员伤亡和财产的损失，他们依法受到中国公安机关的通缉。为了逃避中国人民的审判，他们仓惶出逃，依靠外国庇护，继续从事反对中国人民的反革命活动。而一向宣称严格遵守国际法、不干涉别国内政的法国政府却把中国的在逃刑事犯捧为什么“人权斗士”，为他们继续进行反对中国政府的活动提供舞台，并振振有词地摆出自己的价值标准和法律概念来辩解，企图强迫中国接受。这就不得不令人怀疑，法国政府的真正意图是在维护人权的幌子下，支持反对中国政府的活动。
    任何不怀偏见的人都可以看到：中国政府是稳固的；中国政局是稳定的；我们继续执行改革开放总方针，得到广大人民衷心拥护，任何颠覆人民共和国的企图到头来只不过是一枕黄粱。谁要是把宝押在严家其等这一小撮民族败类的身上，也是注定要失败的。
    应该严肃指出：自从我国政府平息反革命暴乱以来，法国政府已经单方面采取了一系列损害两国关系的步骤。在西欧，是法国政府首先宣布冻结两国的高级接触及其他“制裁”措施，继而又支持“民阵”在巴黎从事颠覆我国政府的非法活动，从而导致了两国关系的恶化。在这种有害的气氛之下，数月来法国发生了一系列骚扰、袭击我驻外机构的暴力恐怖活动，发生了刁难我过境人员、侵犯其人权的事件。我民航代表处、使馆教育处相继遭到侵扰，我方人员在持有效签证的情况下，在巴黎机场多次遭到监视和虐待。9月20日，就在
  “民阵”在巴黎开会前夕，我使馆商务处的一辆轿车被炸毁。所有这些都很难被看作是孤立的偶然事件。中国方面没有做任何对不起法国的事情，而法国却在毒化两国关系方面越走越远。人们不禁要问：法国政府究竟要把中法关系引向何处？
    中国是一个独立自主的主权国家，我们决不允许任何外国政府侵犯我国主权、干涉我国内政。我们一贯主张按和平共处五项原则处理国与国之间的关系，我们不向别国输出我们的社会政治制度，同样也不允许任何国家把他们的社会政治制度、价值观念和政治意志强加给我们。我们希望法国政府以两国人民的长远利益为重，严格遵守国际关系准则，立即停止一切干涉我国内政的活动。25年前，富有远见卓识的戴高乐将军率先打开了通向中国的大门，奠定了中法友谊的基石。中国政府和中国人民历来珍视中法友谊，我们不愿意看到这打开的大门由于某些人士的短视和不谨慎而被重新关上。
