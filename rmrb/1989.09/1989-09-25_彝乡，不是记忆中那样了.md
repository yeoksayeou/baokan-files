Ten years ago, my first visit to Yizhi Bai Le was an embarrassing experience that is still vivid in my memory. This year, when I returned, what I saw and heard astonished me!

In 1979, I was assigned as a medical worker to Dazhao County, Yizhou Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. My first trip to the countryside was to Yizhi Bai Le to treat more than ten Yi people suffering from acute gastroenteritis. On the way, I thought: the scenery in the mountain village must be beautiful, with lush trees and misty mountain peaks. The life of the Yi people must be as idyllic as a pastoral poem. However, as soon as I entered the mountain village, what caught my eye was a scene of slash-and-burn agriculture. The walnuts and chestnuts that the Yi people were proud of had not developed over the years and were almost completely cut down due to poor management. The streams that should have been clear were muddy from animal waste. I walked into the village with confusion.

After working for a few hours, I was desperate to use the toilet. I asked the commune party secretary, Xun Dianliang, where the toilet was, and he told me it was at the village entrance. I searched the entire village but couldn't find the toilet. I asked a few shepherd boys, but they just shook their heads and laughed. I couldn't hold it any longer and had to squat behind a tree. Just as I squatted down, five or six dogs stared at me with their tongues hanging out. I was so scared that I quickly ran back to the village and asked Old Xun to guard me. This was the most embarrassing experience for someone who grew up in the county town.

After dinner by the fire pit, I slept in the dilapidated wooden house, feeling no sense of "antique elegance," but rather a great shock to my emotions.

The next few days were spent worrying about using the toilet and drinking water.

Half a month of living in the mountain village left me with many impressions. Many of the Yi people's ways of life were hard to understand. They were so sincere, enthusiastic, and hospitable, yet so poor, backward, and ignorant. Why couldn't they change?

The walnut and chestnut flowers bloomed year after year, and the cuckoos sang year after year. The trees grew, and the mountains turned green. In my interactions with the Yi people, accompanied by the soft sounds of the moon guitar and mouth harp, the embarrassing scene from ten years ago gradually faded from my memory.

This year in March, to save an elderly Yi woman suffering from pulmonary heart disease, I, along with the township head of Santai, Yang Zhengjing, once again set foot on the path to Yizhi Bai Le. The walnut and chestnut trees lined the path, and the scene of slash-and-burn agriculture was gone. The scattered trees of the past had become orchards.

Entering the village, I saw clean paths and new brick houses. The dilapidated wooden houses were gone. After treating the patient, I wanted to use the toilet again and hesitantly asked Yang, the township head, to guard me. Yang laughed and said, "Why do you need a guard to use the toilet? It's right behind the house." I asked in disbelief, "Is there a toilet?" Yang said, "Yes, yes!" When he heard that I had once been in such an embarrassing situation, he laughed and said, "That was in the past. In recent years, the party's policy of enriching the people has been implemented here. The entire Yi homeland has vigorously developed economic fruit forests. People's income has increased, and their way of thinking and lifestyle have changed. Everyone longs for a civilized, hygienic, and healthy new life. Now, almost every household has a toilet, and hundreds of water tanks of various sizes have been built. More than 70% of the people have access to clean and hygienic tap water. According to the epidemic prevention department, various infectious diseases have decreased by 90%."

At this time, the village head of Yizhi Bai Le, Zheng Hongliang, excitedly said, "The people of our village have changed their old habits. Everyone builds toilets, uses human and animal waste for agricultural production, saves expenses, and increases soil fertility. We have also built reservoirs, and every household has water pipes connected to their doors."

That night, lying in the new brick house, I felt an indescribable joy.

    彝乡，不是记忆中那样了
    杜中语
    10年前，我第一次来到它支白寨的那次尴尬的经历，还清晰地留在记忆之中；今年我再次来到这里，所见所闻，却使我惊诧了！
    1979年，我作为医务工作者被分配到云南省楚雄彝族自治州大姚县三台乡工作。第一次下乡出诊，就是到它支白寨去抢救十多个患急性肠胃炎的彝胞。去的路上，我心里想：山寨风景一定很美，郁郁葱葱的树木，山顶云雾缭绕，彝胞的生活也是如田园牧歌般的美好。然而，一走进山乡，首先映入我眼帘的，却是一片刀耕火种的景象，彝族同胞引以为自豪的核桃、板栗，多年来没有发展不说，反而因管理不善，几乎被砍伐光了。一条条山泉，不是书中所描写的那种清清的小溪，而是被牲畜粪便糟塌得混浊不堪。我带着迷惑走进了寨子。
    忙了几个小时之后，大小便急得我心慌。我问同来的公社党委书记杞典亮厕所在哪儿，他告诉我在村头。我找遍了寨子内外也没有见到厕所。又问了几个放羊的少年，他们摇着头只是笑。我实在耐不住了，只好跑在一棵树后，谁知刚蹲下就有五六条狗虎视眈眈地伸长了舌头。我吓得连忙往村里跑，请来老杞做保镖。这对于在县城里长大的我来说，是再难为情不过的了。
    蹲在火塘边吃完晚饭后，睡在那破烂陈旧的木房中，丝毫没有“古朴典雅”之感，相反使我的感情受到了很大的震撼。
    以后的几天，都是为大小便和饮水而发愁。
    半个月的山寨生活，使我感触颇多；彝族人民许多生活方式，真叫人不能明白，他们是那样真诚、热情、好客，可又是如此贫困、落后、愚昧，为什么不能改变一下呢？
    核桃、板栗花开了一春又一春，布谷鸟叫了一年又一年。树多了，山绿了，在同彝胞们的接触中，随着月琴、口弦悠悠地声音，10年前那个令人难堪的场面，已在我心中淡忘。
    今年3月，为去抢救一个患肺心病的彝族老阿妈，我同三台乡乡长杨正经一起，再次踏上它支白寨的路。小道旁核桃、板栗枝叶相交，刀耕火种的景象不见了，昔日那东一棵，西一棵的林果，已经成园成片。
    进入寨子，干干净净的小道、一幢幢新盖的瓦房呈现在我的面前，破旧的木房不见了。待我诊治完病人后，又想去解大小便，便不好意思地请杨乡长做保镖。杨乡长笑着说：“上厕所要什么保镖，房后就是。”我带着疑惑问：“有厕所吗？”杨乡长说道：“有、有！”当他得知我曾因解大小便闹得狼狈不堪时，大笑着对我说道：那是过去的事了，近些年来，这里落实了党的富民政策，整个彝乡大力发展经济林果，群众收入多了，思想观念和生活方式也发生了变化，人们都向往着文明、卫生、健康的新生活。现在全乡几乎家家都有厕所，还建起了各类大小水池数百个，70％以上的人饮上了清洁卫生的自来水，据防疫部门报告，各种传染病已经下降90％。
    这时，在一旁的它支白寨的村长郑红亮激动地说：“我们寨子的人，已改变了过去的旧习惯，大家修厕所，把人畜粪便用于农业生产，又节约了开支，还增加了地力；也建造了蓄水池，户户把水管接进了家门。”
    晚上我躺在新瓦房里，心中有说不出的喜悦。
