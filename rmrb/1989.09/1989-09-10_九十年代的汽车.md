According to foreign experts, future cars will have the following characteristics:

The body will no longer be "boxy" but streamlined: It is predicted that by the year 2000, 20% of cars in the United States will have bodies primarily made of plastic. Some car parts can also be made from plastic instead of steel during manufacturing. This will not only reduce the weight of the car but also enhance its durability.

A full transmission system will be an essential component of future cars: This system can automatically adjust the torque between the front and rear wheels, meaning the front and rear axles can be operated separately and simultaneously. Currently, a car's rear wheels and front wheels can only turn in the same direction. However, in future models, the rear wheels can turn in the opposite direction to the front wheels when necessary. When this "full transmission control" is combined with the currently developing "non-locking braking system," it will significantly improve the safety of car travel. Experts believe that driving such cars will definitely require the use of electronic devices.

Increasing engine power: A turbine-driven supercharger supplements pressure to increase the oxygen content in the combustible mixture. Improving the combustion of the mixture through a turbocharger can achieve complete combustion, thereby saving fuel and reducing exhaust emissions. Another method is to double the number of valves in the cylinders. Currently, both Japan and Western Europe are competing to adopt cylinders with four valves.

Computer monitoring and control: The main task of computers in cars is to monitor and control the operation of electronic instruments and certain components on the car, including observing road conditions, selecting the optimal driving route, controlling fuel consumption, and adjusting the cabin temperature. The computer display on the dashboard can provide the driver with all necessary data.

Using low-pollution fuels: It is predicted that by the year 2000, a high-quality methanol will be used, which can reduce pollution by 90%.

Using ceramics to manufacture car engines: Because ceramics can withstand high temperatures, this allows the engine to operate at higher temperatures, achieving fuel savings.

　　九十年代的汽车

    根据外国专家的预计，未来的汽车将具有下列特点：
    外壳不再是“匣式”而成流线型：预计到二○○○年时，美国将有百分之二十的汽车外壳主要由塑料制成。有些汽车零部件，在制造时也可用塑料来替代钢材。这样既减轻了汽车的重量，同时还能提高它的坚固性。
    全传动系统是未来汽车不可少的组成部分：这种系统能够自动调节前后两对轮子间形成的扭矩，就是说，汽车的前后两个轴可以分别地同时进行操纵。我们知道，现在的汽车，后轮与前轮只能朝同一方向转动。而未来的新型汽车，其后轮与前轮在必要时则可向相反的方向转动。而一旦将这种“全传动操纵”与目前正在研制的“不卡死的制动装置”结合起来，便可以大大提高汽车行驶的安全系数。专家们认为，驾驶这样的汽车一定要使用电子设备。
    加大发动机的功率：叶轮式鼓风机由涡轮来补充压力，以提高易燃混合液中的氧气含量。通过涡轮增压器改善混合液的燃烧，可以使其充分燃烧，以达到节约燃料和减少废气排出的目的。另外一种办法，就是把气缸中的阀门数量增加一倍。目前日本和西欧都争相采用四个阀门的汽缸。
　  计算机监视和操纵：汽车上计算机的主要任务，是监视和操纵车上的电子仪器和某些零部件的工作，其中包括观察路面情况，选择最佳行驶路线，控制燃料消耗和调节坐舱气温。装在仪表板上的计算机显示器可以给司机提供一切必要的数据。
    使用低污染燃料：预计到二○○○年，将使用一种质量很好的甲醇，到那时将可使污染降低百分之九十。
    用陶瓷制造汽车发动机：因为陶瓷能耐高温，这样就可以提高发动机的工作温度，达到节约燃料的目的。
