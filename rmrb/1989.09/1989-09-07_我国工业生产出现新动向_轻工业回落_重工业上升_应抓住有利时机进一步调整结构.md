	According to data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, the total industrial output value for August nationwide was 106.6 billion yuan, an increase of 6.1% compared to the same period last year. This is a decrease of 4.7 percentage points compared to the 10.8% growth rate in the first half of this year and a decrease of 3.5 percentage points compared to the 9.6% growth rate in July.

	Within the industrial output value, light industry grew by 4.2%, while heavy industry grew by 8%. The growth rate of heavy industry has once again surpassed that of light industry.

	Currently, light industry is facing challenges such as weak demand and insufficient raw materials. Since June, the continuous decline in demand has spread from high-end consumer goods to general daily-use industrial products. The commercial and industrial inventories of some products have increased significantly, which has had a noticeable suppressing effect on the production of related products. Light industry production in August was the lowest growth rate for the same period since 1983.

	At the same time, the structure of heavy industry products continues to improve. The growth rate of energy production in August has further accelerated, with a total increase of 12.4%. Among these, the growth rates of raw coal, crude oil, natural gas, and electricity generation were all significantly higher than the growth rates of the previous seven months. This has led to noticeable improvements in the production of metallurgical, chemical raw materials, and agricultural chemical products since the beginning of the year. Additionally, the reduction in the scale of fixed asset investments has further controlled the production of investment-type products.

	Looking at the industrial production trends over the past two months, progress has been made in controlling the total output, creating conditions for structural adjustments. However, due to weak consumption, some enterprises are facing large inventories and difficulties in recovering funds, leading many production enterprises to fall into a severe "triangular debt" predicament. This situation may cause further deterioration in industrial economic benefits, making the industrial production in the remaining four months of this year and even early next year face a more severe situation.

    我国工业生产出现新动向
    轻工业回落  重工业上升
    应抓住有利时机进一步调整结构
    本报北京9月7日讯　记者朱剑红报道：据国家统计局提供的资料，8月份全国共完成工业总产值1066亿元，比去年同期增长6.1％，比今年上半年的10.8％和7月份的9.6％分别回落了4.7个和3.5个百分点。
    在工业产值中，轻工业产值增长4.2％，重工业产值增长8％。重工业生产增幅则重新超过轻工业。
    目前，轻工业生产面临需求疲软、原料不足的困境。6月份以来，连续数月的需求疲软从高档消费品逐步波及一般日用工业品，部分产品的商业及工业库存上升较多，已对相关的产品生产产生明显的抑制作用。8月份轻工生产是自1983年以来同期增幅最低的。
    与此同时，重工业产品结构继续改善。8月份能源生产增长进一步加快，总量增长12.4％。其中，原煤、原油、天然气、发电均明显快于前7个月的增长幅度，这使得冶金、化工原材料和支农化工产品生产比年初有明显改善。同时，受压缩固定资产投资规模的影响，投资类产品的生产得到进一步控制。
    从近两个月的工业生产趋势看，总量控制继续取得进展，为调整结构创造了条件。但是，由于消费疲软，也造成了部分企业产品大量积压，资金回收困难，使相当多的生产企业陷入严重的“三角债”窘境。这种情况可能造成工业经济效益的进一步滑坡，使今年后4个月乃至明年初的工业生产面临更为严峻的局面。
