Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, September 9th.

To end the six-year-long civil war, Sudan held a national peace dialogue conference.

Sudan's military government leader, General Omar al-Bashir, invited the leader of the southern rebel forces, John Garang, to attend the conference on its opening day, September 9th.

Bashir, in his speech at the opening ceremony, said that the Sudan Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, which he leads, has been seeking to end the six-year civil war with the southern rebel forces through negotiations.

He said that since his government took power in July, it has implemented a unilateral ceasefire, issued an amnesty for rebel fighters, and agreed to continue United Nations-sponsored relief operations in southern Sudan.

Bashir called on all Sudanese to pay attention to the country's peace efforts and pointed out that the current situation is favorable for achieving peace.

Attendees at the national peace dialogue conference included Bashir's Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, cabinet ministers, and over 1,200 representatives from northern and southern Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, the southern rebel forces, did not send any representatives to the conference.

The conference was held under the chairmanship of the newly formed 77-member military-political committee.
