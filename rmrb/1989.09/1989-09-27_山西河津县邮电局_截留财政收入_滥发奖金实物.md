The communications service department of the Hejin County Postal Service Bureau in our province has been in operation since 1986. It lacks a proper workplace, has no registered personnel, and has no independent funds. However, it has fully distributed the 740,000 yuan income from its contracted projects. Furthermore, despite the fact that the wage fund of the Hejin County Postal Service Bureau is already severely overspent, the bureau has used various methods to transfer 60,000 yuan of enterprise funds to the service department's account for use as bonuses.

Since January 1987, the Hejin County Postal Service Bureau has distributed cash bonuses totaling 219,000 yuan to its employees under various pretexts. It has also purchased items such as wool coats, round tables, tea tables, and fabrics, amounting to 34,000 yuan. Notably, 166,000 yuan of this cash was distributed in a rush after the decision to transfer the main responsible person of this postal service bureau was announced.

    山西河津县邮电局
    ——截留财政收入　滥发奖金实物
    我省河津县邮电局通讯服务部自1986年开业至今，一无工作场所，二无注册人员，三无自有资金，却将承揽工程的74万元收入全部分光发净。此外，河津县邮电局还不顾工资基金已严重超支的情况，用各种手法将企业6万元资金转移到服务部账户，用作奖金。
    1987年1月以来，河津县邮电局以各种名目，给本局职工发放现金21.9万元，购买呢子大衣、圆桌、茶几、布料等实物，折款3.4万元。值得重视的是其中有16.6万元现金，是在这个邮电局主要负责人调动工作的决定宣布后突击抢发的。
