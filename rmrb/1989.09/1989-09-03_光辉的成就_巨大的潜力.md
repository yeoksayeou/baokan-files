Brilliant Achievements and Vast Potential

Pu Chaozhu, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Yunnan is located in the southwestern border region of the motherland. The province has over 4,000 kilometers of international borders, and within it, there are 25 ethnic groups. The province is vast and rich in resources, being the province with the most diverse species of plants and animals and the richest variety of minerals in the country.

On the eve of Yunnan's liberation, the economy and culture were extremely backward, and the social and economic development among various ethnic groups was highly uneven. Approximately one-sixth of the province's minority areas were in different stages of social and economic development, ranging from the late primitive society, slave society, to feudal lordship.

In the 40 years since the founding of New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Yunnan has undergone tremendous changes. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have adhered to reform and opening up, making the national economy grow steadily and significantly, and the economic strength has been notably enhanced, with the main economic proportions tending to be coordinated. In 1988, the province's gross national product reached 26.821 billion yuan, and the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 26.1 billion yuan, more than doubling the 1978 figure. The decade of reform has brought about tremendous changes in Yunnan, which are mainly reflected in three aspects: First, the transition from a natural economy to a commodity economy. The commodity rate in rural areas increased from 26.5% in 1978 to 60%. Previously, 70% of daily necessities relied on imports from other provinces, but now the exports are 1.6 times the imports, and the self-sufficiency rate of daily consumer goods has reached over 70%. Second, the shift from a closed economy to an open one. Now, trade is conducted with over 70 countries, and border trade is developed through inland ports. There have been significant achievements in introducing talents, technologies, and funds, and in conducting technical exchanges and cooperation. The tourism industry is also developing rapidly. Third, the financial strength has increased, and the living standards of the people have significantly improved. In 1978, the province's fiscal revenue was only 1.1 billion yuan, but by 1988, it had risen to 5.04 billion yuan. This has gradually increased investment in agriculture, energy, transportation, education, and scientific research, enhancing the development momentum, and improving the people's living standards. In 1988, the total retail sales of social commodities in the province reached 14.4 billion yuan, with an average annual living expenditure of 1,056 yuan for urban residents and 427 yuan for farmers.

In the past decade, the reason Yunnan has achieved these results is that we have combined the actual situation of Yunnan and adhered to the principles, policies, and guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Our basic experience can be summarized in four points: First, adhere to the leadership of the Party and the socialist direction, maintain the unity of all ethnic groups, and ensure the stability of the border areas. We have always made the greatest efforts to develop the economy of the border ethnic regions, persistently conducted socialist and patriotic education among the border ethnic peoples, maintained the unity of all ethnic groups, and in the 10-year period of supporting the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, we have made the greatest efforts to support the People's Liberation Army in defending the sacred territory of the motherland, and properly handled some complex social contradictions and ethnic issues. Second, through various means, stimulate the commodity economy consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups and develop the commodity economy. Third, adhere to the combination of reform and development, be pragmatic, and develop the economy according to local conditions. Under the guidance of the policy of "not relaxing grain production and actively developing diversified operations," we have adjusted the rural industrial structure, taking tobacco, sugar, tea, and rubber as the starting industries to provide sufficient raw materials for the development of light industry. At the same time, relying on light industry to increase accumulation, we have focused on strengthening the construction of energy, transportation, and other basic facilities and developing education and scientific research, promoting and driving the development of subsequent industries, and selectively developing Yunnan's rich resources in a phased and prioritized manner. This is a path to revitalize Yunnan's economy through reform and opening up. Fourth, we have always believed that to develop the economy and culture of ethnic regions, we must rely on the people of all ethnic groups, with the support of the state, and carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. The vitality and initiative within the ethnic groups are the fundamental way to change the backward and poor face of ethnic regions.

Yunnan is a beautiful and rich land of the motherland. Although we have made greater progress compared to the past, from an overall perspective, we are still in a situation of rich resources but poor economy. We will further adhere to the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up. We will continuously improve the investment environment and warmly welcome friends from all brother provinces and cities, foreign friends, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan to carry out economic and technological exchanges and cooperation in our province, jointly developing our rich resources of phosphate, non-ferrous metals, hydropower, forests, and tropical resources such as rubber, coffee, spices, and traditional Chinese medicine, as well as tourism resources. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the new Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, closely relying on and uniting the people of all ethnic groups, all undertakings in Yunnan will achieve even more brilliant victories.

    光辉的成就  巨大的潜力
    中共云南省委书记　普朝柱
    云南位于祖国西南边陲，全省有4000多公里国境线，省内有25个民族，幅员辽阔，资源丰富，是全国动植物种类和矿藏种类最多的省份。
    云南解放前夕，经济文化十分落后，各民族之间社会经济发展极不平衡，约占全省1／6的少数民族地区，分别处于原始社会末期、奴隶社会、封建领主制等不同社会经济形态。新中国成立40年来，在中国共产党的领导下，云南发生了翻天覆地的变化。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，云南各族人民坚持改革开放，使国民经济持续稳定增长，经济实力显著增强，主要经济比例关系趋向协调。1988年，全省国民生产总值达268.21亿元，工农业总产值达261亿元，比1978年翻了一番多。10年改革给云南带来的巨大变化，突出表现在3个方面，一是从自然经济向商品经济转变，农村商品率由1978年的26.5％提高到60％。过去日用工业品70％靠外省调入，现在调出是调入的1.6倍，日用消费品自给率达70％以上。二是由封闭向开放转变。现在与70多个国家有贸易往来，并利用内陆口岸开展边境贸易，在引进人才、技术、资金、开展技术交流合作等方面成效显著，旅游事业不断发展。三是财力增强，人民生活水平明显提高。1978年我省财政收入才11亿元，1988年上升到50.4亿元，从而逐步增加了对农业、能源、交通、教育、科研等方面的投入，增强了发展后劲，人民生活也有了较大改善。1988年全省社会商品零售总额144亿元，城镇居民人均生活费收入1056元，农民人均纯收入427元。
    近10年，云南之所以取得这些成绩，主要是我们结合云南实际，实事求是地坚持贯彻了党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策。我们的基本体会有4条：第一，坚持党的领导和社会主义方向，维护各民族的团结，保证边疆的稳定。我们始终以最大的努力，发展边疆民族地区经济，坚持不懈地对边疆各族人民进行社会主义和爱国主义的教育，维护了各民族的团结；在长达10年对越自卫还击作战的支前中尽了最大努力，配合中国人民解放军捍卫了祖国神圣领土的完整，还妥善处理了一些复杂的社会矛盾和民族问题。第二，通过各种办法诱发各族群众的商品经济意识，发展商品经济。第三，坚持改革与发展相结合，实事求是，因地制宜发展经济。在“绝不放松粮食生产、积极发展多种经营”的方针指导下，调整农村产业结构，把烟、蔗、茶、胶等经济作物作为起步产业，为轻工业的发展提供充足的原料。同时，依靠轻工企业增加积累，重点用于加强能源、交通等基础设施建设和发展教育科研事业，促进和带动后续产业，有重点、分阶段择优开发云南丰富资源，这是一条通过改革开放振兴云南经济的路子。第四，我们始终认为，坚持发展民族地区的经济、文化，在国家扶持下，必须依靠各族人民，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神。各族人民内部的活力和积极性是改变少数民族地区贫困落后面貌的根本。
    云南是祖国一块美丽富饶的宝地。虽然我们比过去有了较大的发展，但从整体看，仍处于资源富饶、经济贫困的状况。我们将进一步按照党的十三届四中全会精神，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，不断改善投资环境，热忱欢迎各兄弟省市、国外友好人士和港澳台同胞来我省开展经济技术交流、合作，共同开发我省丰富的磷矿、有色金属、水能、森林以及橡胶、咖啡、香料、南药为主的热区资源和旅游资源。我们坚信，在以江泽民同志为核心的新的党中央领导下，紧密依靠和团结各族人民，云南各项事业必将取得更加辉煌的胜利。
