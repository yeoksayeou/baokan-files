The Lijiang waterway from Guilin City in Guangxi to Dayu, spanning 21 kilometers, has seen frequent activities of hundreds of people using sand-dredging boats to excavate sand from the waterway or its sides for sale. This has resulted in the once well-maintained waterway being dug into a series of pits and mounds. Some sand piles are as high as four meters, not only ruining the scenery but also obstructing the waterway and threatening the safety of tourist boats. Some newly constructed diversion walls have also been taken away by villagers to use as building materials. Officials from the Lijiang Waterway Improvement Project Command say that if this continues, the new waterway will be completely destroyed in just a few years.

    漓江航道破坏严重
    近年来，广西桂林市至大墟二十一公里的漓江航道上，经常有几百人用挖沙船在航道中或航道两侧挖沙出售。这使已整治好的航道被挖得坑坑洼洼，形成了无数沙堆。有的沙堆高达四米，不仅大煞风景，而且破坏航道畅通，威胁旅游船的航行安全。一些新建的导流石坝，也被一些村民挖走当作建筑材料。漓江航道整治工程指挥部的同志说，这样下去，用不了几年，新航道将被破坏殆尽。　湖北武汉水运安全报　江克松
