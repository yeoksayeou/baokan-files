	Acid Rain – The Ecological Scourge
	Wú Jiànguó

	What is Acid Rain

	Due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the air, rainwater is slightly acidic. The global average pH value is 5.6. This value is generally used as the standard to determine whether precipitation should be classified as acid rain. Broadly speaking, the term "acid rain" not only includes "acid rain" but also acid fog, acid hail, acid snow, and acid dew.

	The Sources and Formation of Acid Rain

	The primary cause of acid rain is the continuous emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides by humans into the atmosphere. Generally, 70% of the acidity is caused by sulfur dioxide, while 30% is due to nitrogen oxides. Coal and petroleum are the most significant sources of sulfur dioxide, with natural gas being the third. Although the nitrogen reservoir is mainly in the atmosphere, the high-temperature combustion of the aforementioned three fossil fuels also produces a large amount of nitrogen oxides. Therefore, thermal power plants and smelting factories are the primary sources of sulfur dioxide emissions and also significant sources of nitrogen oxide emissions. However, some estimates suggest that the primary source of nitrogen oxides is various modes of transportation, including cars and airplanes. In the southern region of California, USA, due to the presence of a large number of cars, 57% of the total acidity in precipitation is caused by nitrogen oxides.

	Under the influence of sunlight and other substances, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which have entered the atmospheric boundary, slowly oxidize to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively. These strong acids fall to the ground with rain, snow, hail, fog, and dew, forming acid rain. Before this, moving air currents can carry these acid rain gases to regions hundreds of kilometers away. Some studies have shown that after being released, acid smoke can drift with the wind for 650 kilometers in 24 hours. In Norway and Sweden, 80-90% of the acid rain gases are "imported." Of these, 10% come from the United Kingdom, approximately 91,500 tons of sulfur-containing gases per year. According to Canada, 50-70% of the acid rain falling in southeastern Canada originates from the industrial areas of the northeastern United States. However, the acid gases emitted by Canada also inevitably fall in adjacent regions of the United States. In recent years, these two friendly countries have had multiple disputes and less-than-pleasant "acid rain negotiations" over this issue.

	The Harm and Control of Acid Rain

	One of the most notable harms of acid rain is the acidification of lakes, leading to a sharp decline or even mass death of fish populations. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in Sweden, Norway, and North America. In southern Norway, one-third of the 2,000 lakes have no fish. In the high-altitude lakes of New York State, the percentage of lakes without fish increased from 4% in the 1930s to 45% in 1975. The aging of fish populations due to water acidification has a more global characteristic. In addition, many aquatic, amphibious animals, plants, and microorganisms are also harmed by acid rain. Terrestrial plants are not immune to the direct or indirect damage of acid rain through soil acidification. Many scientists believe that the globally significant phenomenon of large-scale forest decline is mainly related to acid rain. In West Germany, 50% of the forests are harmed by acid rain and are heading towards death; in southern Sweden, one out of every ten trees is damaged or already dead. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, East Germany, Romania, Yugoslavia, the United States, and many other countries and regions have also sounded the alarm for large-scale forest decline and tree death. Acid rain does not discriminate between the rich and the poor. In recent years, China has discovered that many regions have symptoms of "mountains without trees" and "waters without fish" due to acid rain.

	Environmental acidification can also endanger human health. For example, under acidic conditions, mercury can accumulate in fish through the food chain, posing a threat to the human body. Additionally, due to the pollution and corrosion of water sources and water pipes by acid rain, many harmful metal elements, including lead, pose a significant threat to human health. It has been found that materials such as cement, stone, and metals, including steel, are severely corroded and damaged by acid rain. Therefore, many famous historical sites around the world, such as ancient buildings, monuments, and sculptures, are facing the danger of silently disappearing in acid rain!

	Acid rain is just one important aspect of air pollution. The ecological disaster in the Northern Hemisphere, characterized by fish deaths and forest decline, is the result of the combined action of acid rain, smog, drought, soil acidification, accumulation of acidic substances in leaves, and the increase of ozone in the atmosphere. The control of acid rain should include two aspects: one is to treat the already acidified environment, and the other is to strictly control and reduce the emission of acid rain gases. Sweden, the United States, and West Germany have attempted to use calcium carbonate to rescue water bodies and forests harmed by acid rain. Because calcium carbonate can reduce the acidity of water bodies and soil and enhance their buffering capacity, these measures have had some effect. However, due to high costs and transportation difficulties, this method is not yet widely applicable. In terms of controlling and reducing the emission of acidic gases, installing exhaust gas purification equipment and improving combustion methods are very important. Since 1982, countries such as Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Austria have proposed to reduce their sulfur emissions by 30% by 1993 based on the 1980 levels. Canada has proposed an even higher standard of reducing emissions by 50% during the same period. Since cars are a major source of nitrogen oxides, installing catalytic converters and improving engines are of great significance in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. However, many countries have not yet taken a positive attitude towards these measures. Acid rain, this major environmental pollution problem, is increasingly concerning and alarming. The ecological crisis it causes is becoming increasingly severe and cannot be ignored any longer.

　　酸雨——危及生态的祸水
　　邬建国
        什么是酸雨
    由于空中二氧化碳的存在，雨水微呈酸性。其酸度的全球平均值为PH5.6。该值一般用做衡量降水是否应冠以酸雨之称的标准。酸雨一词，广义地说，不但包括“酸雨”，也包括酸雾，酸雹，酸雪，酸露等。
    酸雨的来源和产生
    产生酸雨的主要原因是人类不断向大气排放硫和氮的氧化物。一般说来，70％的酸度由二氧化硫引起，而30％由氧化氮所致。煤碳和石油燃料是最重要的二氧化硫来源，天然气居第三位。虽然氮库主要在大气，但上述三种化石燃料的高温燃烧同时会产生大量的氧化氮。因此，火力发电机和熔炼厂等便成为二氧化硫最主要的释放源，也同时是氧化氮的重要释放源。然而，有人估计，氧化氮的最主要释放源是各种交通运输媒介，包括汽车，飞机，等等。美国加州南部地区由于大量汽车存在之缘，降水总酸度的57％是由氧化氮引起的。
    在太阳光和其他物质的影响下，进入大气边界的酸雨气体二氧化硫和氧化氮，缓慢氧化，分别生成硫酸和硝酸。这两类强酸随雨，雪，雹，雾，露降落到地面，便形成酸雨。在此之前，移动的气流可将这些酸雨气体带到几百公里之外的地区。据一些研究表明，排放后24小时，酸性烟雾随风漂移达650公里。在挪威和瑞典，80—90％的酸雨气体是“进口”的。其中10％来自英国，大约每年91500吨含硫气体。据加拿大称，50—70％落在加拿大东南部的酸雨源于美国东北部工业区。而加拿大排放的酸性气体也不可避免地落在美国相邻地区。这些年来，这两个友好国家也因此多有争议和不尽愉快的“酸雨谈判”。
            酸雨的危害及治理
    最为注目的酸雨危害之一是湖泊酸化而引起的鱼类数量骤减乃至大量死亡。在瑞典、挪威和北美地区，该现象尤为显著。在挪威南部的2000个湖泊中，1／3全无鱼影。在纽约州的高海拔湖泊中，无鱼百分率从30年代的4％迅速增加到1975年的45％。由于水体酸化而导致的鱼群老化现象更具有全球性特点。此外，许多水生，两栖的动物，植物和微生物也遭到酸雨的危害。陆地植物也难免酸雨的直接或通过土壤酸化的间接伤害。许多科学家相信，举世瞩目的全球森林大衰减与酸雨有主要关系。在西德，50％的森林受酸雨所害，走向死亡；在瑞典的南部地区，每10棵树便有一颗受损或已经死亡。捷克斯洛伐克，波兰，奥地利，瑞士，东德，罗马尼亚，南斯拉夫，美国等许多国家和地区，都敲响了森林大衰减、树木大死亡的警钟。酸雨不问贫富。近年来，我国已发现不少地区出现“山无树”、“水无鱼”的酸雨症。
    环境酸化还会危及人类健康。例如，在酸性条件下，汞会通过食物链累积于鱼体内，进而危害人体。此外，由于酸雨对水源和输水管道的污染和腐蚀作用导致包括铅在内的许多有害金属元素会对人体健康带来巨大威胁。现已发现，灰泥、石头、以及包括钢铁在内的金属材料都会遭受酸雨的严重腐蚀破坏。因此，世界各地的许多名胜古迹，如古老建筑物，纪念碑，塑雕等，正面临着在酸雨中无声息地消失的危险！
    酸雨只是大气污染的一个重要方面，以鱼类死亡和森林衰减为重要标志的北半球生态大灾难是酸雨、雾罩、干旱、土壤酸化、酸性物质在树叶中的积累，以及大气中臭氧的增加等因素共同作用的结果。而治理酸雨须包括两个方面：一是医治已酸化的环境，二是严格控制和减少酸雨气体的排放。瑞典、美国和西德等国已尝试用碳酸钙挽救酸雨危害的水体和森林。由于碳酸钙能够降低水体和土壤的酸度，并增强其缓冲性能，这些措施已收到效果。但由于耗价高，再加交通运输等困难，该方法尚难以普及。在控制和减少酸性气体排放方面，安装废气净化装置和改进燃烧方式都很重要。自1982年起，已有挪威、芬兰、瑞典、丹麦以及奥地利等国提出，到1993年本国排硫量在1980年的基础上降低30％。加拿大则提出在同期内降低50％的更高标准。由于汽车是氧化氮的主要释放源之一，安装催化转化器和改进引擎对减少氧化氮排放有重大意义。然而，不少国家尚未对上述措施采取积极态度。酸雨，这一重大环境污染问题，日益令人关注，触目惊心。而这一祸水所产生的日趋严重的生态危机更不容我们再等闲视之。
