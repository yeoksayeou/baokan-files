**Standing the Test of Blood and Fire**

**—A Record of the Shanxi Office in Beijing During the Turmoil and Riots**

**Standing Firm at the Post**

The Shanxi Office in Beijing has five units, located near the epicenter of the turmoil in Tiananmen Square, with the closest being only half a kilometer away. After parts of Beijing were placed under martial law on May 20, some staff members asked Director Lian Anyu, "Director, the people in the small shop across from our office on Jing Shan Xi Street have all gone to join the protests. Shouldn't we take some supplies from our office to support the students?" Director Lian replied, "We are a Beijing-based unit and do not participate in local activities. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Government have not given us instructions to support the students. We will neither go nor provide support. Our task is to properly receive guests from Shanxi who come to Beijing on business and to serve the development of the economy. We will not get involved in other matters."

The thoughts of the office staff were not entirely unified, and if not managed strictly, problems might arise. To maintain high unity with the Party Central Committee and not let down the people of Shanxi, they immediately convened a meeting of all middle-level cadres to unify thoughts and study measures to ensure full attendance, work diligently, and not participate in illegal social activities:

1. Each department, section, and class will check attendance daily. If any unit has problems or loses face, the leader of that unit will be held responsible.
2. Work must be done seriously during office hours, and those who do not complete their daily tasks will be subject to disciplinary action.
3. Training classes for accountants, financial staff, cooks, and service personnel will be organized to ensure there are meaningful activities outside of work hours.
4. Repeatedly organize staff to study the speech by Premier Li Peng at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Meeting, the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to all Communist Party members and the people of the nation, and the Beijing Municipal Government's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd orders to unify thoughts and regulate behavior.

Through the solid and detailed work of the office, departments, sections, and classes, during the two months of the student movement, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary riots, the staff attendance rate reached about 99%. Out of 284 staff members, not a single person was found to have gone to the streets to watch, protest, support, or block military vehicles.

**Persuading Students**

Before and after parts of the capital were placed under martial law, the number of students from across the country coming to Beijing to support the hunger strike at Tiananmen Square gradually increased. At its peak, 2,400 students from 17 colleges and universities in Shanxi came to Beijing to support the students. On May 18, three student representatives came to the Qianmen Reception Hall and immediately made three demands to the hall's leadership: first, they wanted the office director to represent the province in supporting their "patriotic" actions; second, they wanted help solving their food and accommodation problems; third, they wanted to be provided with drinks. In response, the office immediately reported to the provincial government via direct dial phone and convened a meeting of the office's party branch committee. It was finally decided that Director Lian Anyu would handle the students' affairs, clearly stating: the Provincial Party Committee and Government have not authorized the office to support you, the office's conditions are limited and cannot accommodate you at the expense of our guests, and we cannot provide you with food. They also persuaded the students to leave Beijing and return to school as soon as possible. On the same day, a student leader from Shanxi University came to the office and wanted to make a direct dial phone call to the school. The office staff helped him get through. This leader informed the school about the situation in Beijing, and since they could not solve the food and accommodation problems after arriving, the originally planned 300-plus students did not come to Beijing. On May 27, according to the instructions of the State Council, the province decided to form a working group consisting of Lian Anyu and four others from the Provincial Education Commission to do the work of persuading students to leave Beijing. The office dispatched Deputy Director of the General Office Fan Daosheng to actively assist. That afternoon, they studied how to do the work of persuading students to leave Beijing and return to school as soon as possible. Through various channels, it was learned that the number of students from Shanxi University coming to Beijing was about 1,000, plus students from the other 16 colleges and universities, totaling more than 2,400. The working group members, through patient and meticulous persuasion and education, by June 2, the number of Shanxi students in Beijing was reduced to about 80. By June 3, except for five students who did not want to return to school, all the other students boarded the train back to Shanxi.

**A Heart of Loyalty**

On June 3, the student movement and turmoil in Beijing had developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. On June 9, when the martial law troops were in extreme difficulty, the office immediately decided to provide support. They bought 100 boxes of canned goods, 200 boxes of drinks, 750 kilograms of flour, 200 packs of cigarettes, and a sack of garlic, representing the Provincial Party Committee and Government to visit and comfort the martial law troops. At 3 PM, they found a driver, removed the car's license plate, and with the section chief escorting, they braved the danger and safely delivered three cars of comfort supplies to the martial law troops' command center in Tiananmen Square.

The leaders of the martial law troops, upon receiving these comfort supplies, excitedly said, "You are the first Beijing-based unit to support us in our most difficult time. The people of Shanxi have always loved and firmly supported the troops. Please convey our gratitude to Secretary Li and Governor Shen." Vice Secretary of the State Council Chang Jie said to Lian Anyu, "The Shanxi Office in Beijing has a firm stance and clear banner, setting a good example for all Beijing-based offices nationwide."

    经受血与火的考验
    ——记动乱暴乱期间的山西驻京办事处
    坚守岗位
    山西驻京办事处有5个单位，地处天安门广场动乱源的周围，最近的只有半公里远。5月20日北京部分地区实行戒严后，有的职工问连安余：“主任，我们景山西街5号对门小铺子里的人员都上街游行去了，咱们办事处有吃的，有喝的，还不应该拿上些物品去声援学生？”连主任说：“我们是驻京单位，不参加当地活动。山西省委、省政府没有给我们声援学生的指示，我们一不去，二不给。我们的任务是接待好山西进京办事来的客人，为兴晋富民发展经济服务，其他事我们不干。”
    办事处的职工思想并不一致，抓得不紧，说不定会出什么问题。为了和党中央保持高度一致，不给山西人民丢脸，他们立即召开全处中层干部会，统一思想，研究了出满勤、干满点、不参与社会上非法活动的措施：一、每天各所查各所、各科查各科、各班查各班出勤人数，哪个单位出了问题，丢了人，哪个单位的领导负责；二、上班要认认真真工作，不能逍遥懒散，完不成当日任务，要受纪律处分；三、开办会计、财务、炊事员、服务员培训班，让8小时以外也有正事可干；四、反复组织职工学习李鹏总理在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话、中共中央国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书和北京市政府1、2、3号通令，统一大家的思想，规范大家的言行。
    经处、所、科、班扎实细致的工作，学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱的两个月时间内，职工出勤率达99％左右，284名职工，至今没有发现一人上街围观、游行、声援、拦堵军车。
    劝说学生
    首都部分地区实行戒严的前后，全国来京声援天安门广场绝食斗争的学生日渐增多，山西省17所大专院校来京声援的学生高峰时达2400多人。5月18日，3名学生代表来到前外招待所，劈头就向所领导提出3条要求：一要办事处主任代表省里表态，支持他们的“爱国”行动；二要帮他们解决食宿问题；三要供给他们饮料。对此，办事处立即用直拨电话报告了省政府，又召开了处党总支会议，最后决定由连安余主任出面做学生的工作，向他们明确表示：省委、省政府没有授权让办事处表态支持你们，办事处条件有限，绝不能把客人撵走留你们住下，也不能为你们提供饮食，并苦口婆心动员他们尽快离京返校。同一天，山西大学一名学生领队来到办事处，要打直拨电话和学校联系，办事处的同志帮他要通了电话。这名领队向校方讲明北京情况，来京后不能解决食宿问题，这样原计划要来北京的300多名学生就不来了。5月27日，根据国务院指示，省里决定由连安余和省教委派王联辉等4人组成工作组，做来京学生离京动员工作。办事处派办公室副主任范道生积极协助，当天下午就如何做学生尽快离京返校工作进行了研究。通过多方了解得知，山西大学来京人数约1000人，加上其它16所大专院校的学生，共有2400多人。工作组同志经过耐心细致的说服教育，到6月2日，在京的山西学生只剩下80余人。到6月3日，除5名学生不愿返校外，其余学生都乘车返晋。
    一片赤心
    6月3日，北京的学潮、动乱发展成了反革命暴乱。6月9日，戒严部队处于极度的生活困难之时，办事处立即决定支援。他们买了100箱罐头、200箱饮料、750公斤面粉、200条烟和一麻袋大蒜，代表省委、省政府去慰问戒严部队。下午3时，他们找好了司机，拆掉车上的车牌，由所长押车，冒着生命危险，把三车慰问品安全地送到天安门广场戒严部队指挥部。
    戒严部队领导同志接到这些慰问品后，激动地说：“你们是北京驻外单位第一家在我们处于最困难时期支援我们的。你们山西人民对子弟兵是一贯热爱的、坚决支持的。请你们回去转告立功书记、森浩省长，我们非常感谢他们。”国务院副秘书长常捷对连安余说：“山西驻京办事处立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，给全国各驻京办事处带了个好头。”
