In recent years, the production of household refrigerators in our country has developed rapidly. Except for the provinces (autonomous regions) of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and Gansu, every province (autonomous region) and municipality in the country has more than 140 production sites. Apart from the light industry system, the electronics, machinery, aerospace, defense, shipbuilding, and medical sectors are also developing household refrigerator production. By next year, the production capacity will reach at least 12.8 million units per year, exceeding the predicted market demand by 50%.

Earlier, efforts were made to curb this blind development trend. From 100 production sites, 42 were selected as designated production factories, but the results were minimal. In a short period, the Hangzhou region alone saw the emergence of more than 30 new production sites.

One characteristic of the current state of household refrigerator production in our country is the fragmented and small-scale nature of production, which lacks economic efficiency. Statistics show that the average production scale of enterprises is only 59,600 units. There are only three factories with an annual production capacity of more than 200,000 units. This is far from meeting the requirements of economies of scale; compared to the annual production scale of 50 to 80 million units in economically developed countries, the gap is even larger.

Another characteristic is the enthusiasm for developing assembly capabilities, while neglecting the production of key components with high technical and capital intensity, such as compressors and thermostats. For example, in 1987, the national assembly capacity for refrigerators reached over 4 million units, but the production of compressors and thermostats was only 500,000 and 2.44 million units, respectively. This has put refrigerator production in a very passive and loss-making situation, as key components rely heavily on imports, consuming a large amount of national foreign exchange.

Due to the small scale of enterprise production, many factories lack necessary testing equipment, making it difficult to establish a product quality assurance system. This results in poor product stability. According to investigations by relevant departments, the repair rate of household refrigerator products from these factories is as high as 6.8% or more. The high product costs, calculated based on a unified cost standard, show that enterprises producing less than 100,000 units per year have unit product variable costs more than double those of enterprises producing 200,000 units per year.

Blind development and dispersed construction have led to excess production capacity and low-scale efficiency, a situation that has already occurred in the production and construction of the "old three items" and is now repeating itself in the "new three items." Today, air conditioners, sedans, and color picture tubes are also following suit. This has a serious impact on the reasonable allocation and effective use of national limited resources, the improvement of enterprise economic and social benefits, and the protection of consumer interests, causing significant losses to the state, collectives, and individuals.

One of the important reasons for this situation is the lack of awareness of economies of scale. In organizing production and construction, economic laws are not followed, and economies of scale are not pursued.

Some people believe that China has a large population and limited capital, so it is necessary to develop small enterprises that are easy to start and can absorb more labor, and they are skeptical or hesitant about promoting economies of scale. This view is incorrect. Improving economic efficiency is a crucial prerequisite for the development of the national economy. Pursuing input-output efficiency, including economies of scale, is the foundation for improving economic efficiency and accelerating the development of the national economy. Without this prerequisite and foundation, our economy will find it difficult to achieve substantial and rapid growth.

The core of pursuing economies of scale is to increase the concentration of production to facilitate the adoption of advanced technology and equipment, thereby achieving scale economies. Therefore, certain types of products need to be produced by large-scale enterprises, while many assembled products can be broken down into components for specialized and concentrated production. These component factories can have large production batches, embodying economies of scale, but with relatively small investments in production factors. Such small but specialized production enterprises are easy to start and achieve necessary concentration, meeting the requirements of economies of scale and China's national conditions, and are worth promoting. Of course, for labor-intensive products, concentrated production does not necessarily lead to changes in technology and equipment, and the economies of scale are relatively poor. This can be handled according to actual conditions regarding the balance between dispersion and concentration.

In pursuing economies of scale, it is necessary to improve ideological understanding while addressing certain systemic issues. For example, the current multi-level fiscal system, excessive decentralization, and chaotic price system greatly constrain the promotion of economies of scale. Currently, some localities and enterprises, in pursuit of local and short-term interests, ignore the overall national layout, do not consider whether the investment direction is reasonable, and do not think about the long-term development plans of enterprises. They simply want to increase output and profits by any means necessary, leading to blind construction. Some even know that a project, after a few years, will result in oversupply, but they still rush to start it for the sake of short-term profits. These problems are related to the system, and although they are difficult to solve, if not addressed, it will be impossible to promote economies of scale, and national industrial policies and macroeconomic controls will not be truly implemented and executed.

Of course, promoting economies of scale and improving economic efficiency requires a lot of work. For example, it is necessary to urgently study and formulate economies of scale standards suitable for China's national conditions. From the perspective of household refrigerator production in our country, after research and analysis, the economies of scale standard for medium-sized ordinary refrigerators should be set at an annual two-shift production capacity of 400,000 units. Currently, the economies of scale standards for enterprises internationally are: steel plants at 6 million tons of steel per year, car factories at 300,000 vehicles per year, and color picture tube factories at 2 million sets per year, etc. These can be used as references but should not be simply applied to our country.

Additionally, it is necessary to strengthen industry planning and management. According to national industrial policies and economies of scale standards, formulate medium- and long-term development plans for the industry, guide regional and departmental production and construction, and coordinate and provide information services. Furthermore, while strengthening and improving administrative management, it is necessary to use economic control measures.

    讲求规模经济
    ——从家用电冰箱生产现状谈起
    庄升荣　鲁牧
    近几年来，我国家用电冰箱生产发展迅猛。除新、青、藏、甘4省（区）外，全国各省（区）市共有生产厂点140多家。轻工系统不消说，电子、机械甚至航天、兵器、船舶、医疗等部门都在发展家用电冰箱生产。明年形成生产能力将不下1280万台／年，超过市场预测需求量50％。
    对这种盲目发展势头，早些时候虽经一次整顿，曾从100个厂点中筛选出42个为定点生产厂，但收效甚微，一段时间仅杭州地区短期间就又涌现出30多个生产厂点。
    我国家用电冰箱生产现状的特点之一，就是点多分散，规模偏小，缺乏经济性。统计资料表明，企业平均生产规模仅为5.96万台。年产20万台以上的工厂，也只有3家。这与规模经济要求相距甚远；如果与经济发达国家的企业经济规模年产50至80万台相比，差距更大。
    另一个特点是热衷于发展总装能力，而对技术、资金密集程度较高的主要零部件如压缩机、温控器等生产问津者甚少。以1987年为例，全国电冰箱生产的组装能力已有400多万台，而压缩机、温控器的产量分别只有50万和244万台。这给电冰箱生产带来极大被动和损失，主要关键部件只能依赖进口，占用国家大量外汇。
    由于企业生产规模小，许多厂又缺乏必须的测试设备，产品质量保证体系难以建立，导致质量稳定性很差。据有关部门调查，这些厂的家用电冰箱产品返修率高达6.8％以上。产品成本居高不下，按统一费用标准计算，年产10万台以下的企业，其单位产品不变成本就比年产20万台的高出1倍多。
    盲目发展，分散建设，造成生产能力过剩、规模效益低的情况，在过去的“老三件”生产建设中早就出现过，近几年“新三件”的生产建设重蹈覆辙，而今空调器、小轿车、彩色显象管等又有再步后尘之势。它对国家有限资源合理配置和有效利用，企业经济效益和社会效益的提高，消费者利益的保障，无不带来严重影响，使国家、集体、个人三者均受到巨大损失。
    造成这种情况的重要原因之一，就是缺乏规模经济意识。在组织生产建设中，不按经济规律办事，不讲求规模经济。
    有人认为，我国人口众多，资金匮乏，应当多搞容易上马、容纳劳力较多的小企业，对推行规模经济持观望甚至怀疑态度。应当说，这是不对的。提高经济效益，是国民经济发展的重要前提。讲求投入产出效率，包括讲求规模经济，是提高经济效益、加快国民经济发展速度的基础。没有这个前提、基础，我们的经济就很难获得实质性的较快增长。
    讲求规模经济，核心在于提高生产集中程度，以利于采用先进的工艺和装备，从而取得规模效益。因此，某些类型产品的生产需要搞大型企业，而众多的装配式产品生产则可分解为零部件，实行专业化集中生产。这些零部件工厂生产批量可以很大，体现了规模经济，但生产要素投入相对较小。这类小而专的专业化生产企业，既易上马，又做到了必要集中，不仅符合规模经济要求，而且符合我国国情，值得提倡。当然，对于劳动密集产品来说，生产的集中并不一定带来工艺装备的变化，规模经济性较差，这可根据实际情况来处理分散与集中的问题。
    讲求规模经济，需在提高思想认识的同时，注意解决某些体制问题。比如，现行的多级财政、分权过度以及价格体系混乱状况，在很大程度上制约着规模经济的推行。现在，有些地方和企业为了追求局部、短期利益，不顾全国整体布局，不讲投资方向是否合理，更不考虑企业的长期发展规划，只要能够增加产值、利润就想方设法争上项目，盲目建设。有的甚至明知上了个项目，三两年后产品将供过于求，但见这两三年内有利可图也要拚命地上。这些问题的产生就与体制不无关系，尽管解决起来很困难，但如果不予解决，那就谈不上推行规模经济，连国家产业政策和宏观调控也无法真正落实，贯彻执行好。
    当然，推行规模经济，提高经济效益，还需要进行大量的工作。例如，抓紧研究制定符合我国国情的规模经济标准。从我国家用电冰箱生产来说，经过研究分析，目前中等容量普通型电冰箱企业的规模经济标准，应以年产双班能力40万台为宜。当今国际上的企业规模经济标准，钢铁厂为年产600万吨钢，轿车厂为30万辆／年，彩色显象管厂为200万套／年，等等。这些，对我们国家来说，都可作参考而不宜简单套用。
    又如，需要加强行业规划和管理。按照国家产业政策、规模经济标准，制定好行业的中长期发展规划，指导地区、部门生产建设，并搞好协调与信息服务工作。此外，在加强和改善行政管理的同时，必须辅以经济调控手段。
