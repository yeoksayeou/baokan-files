The 82nd General Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union rejected a proposal to interfere in China's internal affairs. The People's Daily correspondent Chen Te'an reported from London on September 4: At the plenary session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that began at 4 PM today, the delegation from the Federal Republic of Germany proposed a so-called "China's suppression of peaceful protesters" as a "supplementary agenda item," attempting to impose it on this session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The head of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China, Fu Hao, immediately refuted this on the spot, pointing out that this was a rude interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.

The assembly voted on this "proposal," resulting in 393 votes against, 509 abstentions, and 335 votes in favor, thus rejecting it. The result of the assembly's vote precisely proves the correctness of the call from those with insight in the international community: China should not and cannot be isolated.

The 82nd General Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union opened this morning in the United Kingdom. The conference, which will last for 6 days, will conclude on September 9.

    各国议会联盟第82届年会
    否决干涉我内政提案
    本报伦敦9月4日电　记者陈特安报道：在今天下午4时开始的各国议会联盟全体会议上，联邦德国议会代表团提出了所谓“中国镇压和平抗议者”的提案，企图把它作为“补充议题”强加给本届各国议会联盟大会。中国全国人大代表团团长符浩在大会上当场予以驳斥，指出这是对一个主权国家内政的粗暴干涉。
    大会就此“提案”进行表决，结果以393票反对，509票弃权，335票赞成而被否决。大会表决的这一结果恰恰证明了国际上有识之士这样一种呼声的正确性：中国不应该也不可能被孤立。
    各国议会联盟第82届年会于今天上午在英国开幕。会议为期6天将于9日闭幕。
