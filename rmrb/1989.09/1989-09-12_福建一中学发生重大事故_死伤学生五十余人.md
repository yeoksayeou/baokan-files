A Major Accident Occurs at a Middle School in Fujian
Dead and Injured Students Number Over Fifty

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 12 (China Education News reporter Zhang Shizhun, Xinhua News Agency reporter Cai Qinghe): At around 8 PM on September 10, the roof of the bulletin board at the illuminated sports field of Liancheng No. 1 Middle School in Fujian Province collapsed, killing 30 students who were participating in an activity and injuring 23 students and 2 civilians.

That evening, Liancheng No. 1 Middle School held an event to celebrate Teachers' Day and the school's 75th anniversary. Over 4,000 teachers, students from the school and neighboring schools, and local residents gathered at the school's illuminated sports field to watch a movie and fireworks. Some students and residents ignored warnings and climbed onto the top of the bulletin board to watch, causing the 20-meter-long, 1.5-meter-wide reinforced concrete slab to collapse due to excessive weight, resulting in this serious accident.

After the accident, Secretary of the State Council Luo Gan conveyed Premier Li Peng's condolences to the families of the injured and deceased students and demanded that the cause of the accident be quickly investigated and addressed. Provincial Party Secretary Chen Guangyi inquired about the situation overnight and ordered the county committee and government to spare no effort in organizing rescue efforts. Governor Wang Zhaoguo rushed from Xiamen to Liancheng overnight to visit the injured and the families of the deceased, and to direct the rescue operations. Leaders from the Longyan Municipal Party Committee and Government also rushed to Liancheng. Over 100 soldiers from the local garrison also rushed to the scene to participate in the rescue efforts.

Currently, 25 injured individuals are being treated at Liancheng County Hospital.

　　福建一中学发生重大事故
　　死伤学生五十余人
    新华社福州9月12日电　（中国教育报记者张诗椿、新华社记者蔡清河）9月10日晚8时许，福建省连城一中灯光球场墙报栏顶盖倒塌，压死参加活动的学生30名、压伤学生23人及群众2人。
    当晚，连城一中举行庆祝教师节和建校75周年活动，学校教职员工、本校和外校学生、附近群众4000多人在学校的灯光球场观看电影和焰火。一些学生和群众不听劝阻爬到墙报栏顶端水泥板上观看，因顶盖负重过大，造成这块长20米、宽1.5米钢筋水泥板倒塌，酿成这次严重伤亡事故。
    事故发生后，国务院秘书长罗干向省人民政府转达了李鹏总理对伤亡学生家长的慰问，并要求尽快查明事故原因做出处理。省委书记陈光毅连夜询问了情况，并要求县委、县政府全力以赴组织救护。省长王兆国连夜从厦门赶到连城，看望伤员和死难者家属，指挥抢救工作。龙岩地委、行署领导也赶赴连城。当地驻军100多名官兵也赶赴现场参加救护工作。
    目前，25名伤员正在连城县医院进行抢救。
