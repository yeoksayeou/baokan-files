    In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's trademark industry has developed rapidly. By the end of June this year, China had over 230,000 valid registered trademarks, which is 4.6 times the number of trademarks registered before liberation. The number of foreign enterprises registering trademarks in China is also increasing. Before 1979, there were only 5,130 registered trademarks from foreign countries and regions in China. By the end of June this year, this number had surged to 34,300.
