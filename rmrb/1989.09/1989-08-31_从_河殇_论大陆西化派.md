In recent years, the intellectual community on the Chinese mainland has seen a surge in historical reflection, with the most prominent being a group of Westernization advocates who criticize China's historical development and future direction from an idealist historical perspective. The authors of "Heshang" can be considered typical representatives, as their television program has caused a sensation due to its unique approach to reflection. This article, while focusing on a critique of the original "Heshang," also serves as a general critique of the Westernization faction on the mainland.

(I) The Issue of China's Modern Historical Development Path

China was once a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. When China broke free from the control of feudal dynasties at the beginning of the 20th century, the world was already under the domination of capitalist imperialism. Chinese society could not smoothly transition from a feudal economic system to a capitalist one under sufficient, self-reliant conditions for capital accumulation. China's capitalism, under the strong interference and exploitation of imperialism, had no chance to develop normally. Traditional land capital could not easily transform into modern industrial and commercial capital, and thus took on the peculiar characteristics of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society.

An advanced agricultural civilization does not necessarily suppress the economy of another backward agricultural society. However, a capitalist country, once its productive forces reach a certain level, will inevitably exert strong oppression and suppression on the capitalism of backward regions. This is due to the self-expanding and invasive nature of capitalist production relations. Therefore, the emphasis in "Heshang" on China's inland agricultural civilization hindering the germination and growth of capitalism and commerce is not entirely correct. The feudal dynasties that relied on agriculture deliberately maintained a policy and cultural ideology that looked down on commercial activities. Even in Europe, during the medieval feudal period, this was a common phenomenon. Canon law even considered receiving interest as a sin. However, the medieval culture that devalued commerce did not truly suppress the primitive accumulation of pre-capitalist Europe. The economy has a self-developing mechanism. Eventually, it overcame the constraints of traditional culture and gradually flourished. Even in the 13th and 14th centuries, the commercial city-states of the Italian peninsula, while flourishing in overseas trade and distant commerce, still had to sneak through the loopholes of canon law for their banking operations, enduring the curses of the general public and growing up.

China's agricultural civilization, due to its mature orderliness and stability, when it became a historical burden, had a greater hindering effect than European feudalism. This is a fact, but China's civilization also has a relatively rational side (which made the intellectuals of the European Enlightenment era admire it), and there was less continuous religious fanaticism and suppression. The closed nature of the Chinese feudal class was not as strict as European bloodlineism. In comparison, it can be said to be a semi-open class system. Therefore, the reason for the underdevelopment of Chinese capitalism is not so much that it was burdened by traditional cultural concepts, but rather that it started late and encountered the imperialist century. Like Japan, its traditional elements were mainly Chinese, and its history of feudal seclusion was no different from China's. However, because it started in the 1870s, when European powers had not yet entered the imperialist stage of the economy, Japan rapidly capitalized during the precious thirty years after the Meiji Restoration.

(II) The Issue of Understanding the History of Capitalist Development

The theme of "Heshang" eagerly seeks to break free from feudal traditional ideology and admires the high productivity and efficiency of capitalism, intentionally or unintentionally idealizing capitalism. The entire work does not mention any criticism of capitalism. Some say that the purpose of creating "Heshang" is to criticize feudal ideology rather than capitalism. However, after breaking free from the constraints of old traditions and "sailing to the sea," this sea is undoubtedly the vast ocean of commodity economy dominated by capitalism. Therefore, criticism of capitalism should also be an indispensable part of the entire structure. Otherwise, the "positive elements" of capitalism, which we view as a possible opportunity for China's economic modernization, will be closely combined with its "negative elements" and flow into China indiscriminately. To yearn for the bright side of capitalism while ignoring its dark side is reckless and passive, and may fill the future of reform with new crises.

Specifically, we should not emphasize the shortcomings of tradition to the extent of unconditionally admiring capitalism. We should not forget that the history of capitalist development is also a history of capitalist brutality. Its development is built on ruthless operations. Its "ruthlessness" is not only a moral sin but also a scientific evil. Although it has accumulated wealth in the short term, it has also established a system that destroys the future.

The ancient and stagnant agricultural civilization should not be envied for its high productivity and efficiency of capitalism and unilaterally wish to catch up through learning. Backward capitalism can never catch up with advanced capitalism. This is the iron law of capitalism. Unless another system is adopted to establish a proactive, mutually beneficial parallel relationship, only then can we take the good and avoid the harm. The so-called "China must go to the world, and the world must come to China." Exchange is indeed two-way, but strong capitalist countries are accustomed to using their strength and position to conduct exchanges that are supposedly fair but actually unfair. The so-called "vast ocean of the world commodity economy" seems to be able to provide some prescriptions to cure the various ailments of low-efficiency planned economy; but we should not forget that the rational basis of commodity economy lies in the principle of equivalent exchange and the automatic adjustment of supply and demand. However, the capitalist commodity economy, the principle of equivalent exchange of all commodities, is based on the unequal exchange between labor and capital. And the supply-demand relationship, under the political operation of monopoly capital, that pair of sensitive "invisible hands" has long withered. At this time, the "supplementary conditions" that the capitalist commodity economy system can bring to the socialist planned economy, apart from some surplus capital and second-hand technology, is the reaffirmation of self-interest motives.

Of course, even so, the significance of learning and exchange is still considerable. After all, Western European capitalism, under different historical conditions from China, has had its glorious practical achievements, constituting a mainstream of world civilization. Although China is walking its own path, it will definitely not be a lonely path. The achievements of capitalism have already become public property in world civilization, and some are necessary inheritance factors. It is just that China needs a correct method of acceptance, actively but rationally facing the "ocean."

(III) The Issue of Understanding Chinese-style Socialism

China, as a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, took the path of socialism through the New Democratic Revolution. Was this an incorrect historical choice? "Heshang" does not use positive terms to affirm this. It only emphasizes that the content of reform is the "introduction" of science and democracy, and that these new value principles are established through the success of the bourgeois revolution. It seems to imply that China did not develop capitalism and therefore lacks science and democracy, and that socialist China also lacks science and democracy. Although "Heshang" advocates science and democracy, it does not provide the necessary interpretation of democracy and science, which cannot be described as anything but reckless. In fact, science and democracy are not value entities with fixed content, but a process of continuous progress. If expressed in abstract terms, science is seeking truth from facts, and democracy is respecting every member of the group. As for its specific content, it is both "breakthrough" and "restrictive" in the stages of progress. When the bourgeoisie wanted to break free from the shackles of the feudal system, it indeed used science and democracy as spiritual forces and ladder-like identity institutions to oppose medieval theocracy and monarchy. However, such "breakthrough" turns into new "restrictions" the day the revolution succeeds and seizes power. To ensure its superior position in production relations and ruling relations, science in the hands of the bourgeoisie is split into the "materialism" of "natural science" and the "idealism" of "humanities." Democracy is only "formal democracy" and does not extend to "substantive democracy." It even uses formal democracy to cover up substantive undemocracy, using the political democratic cloak to protect the undemocratic reality of the economy.

China did not choose the path of capitalism, not purely out of subjective consciousness, but for objective and necessary reasons. If the path of capitalism could indeed be "taken," no force could stop it. For a backward society like China, with low productivity, in the urgent need for group survival to escape the plight of being slaughtered by others, it must free the limited social resources—including human and material resources that constitute productivity—from the shackles of the old production relations, and concentrate and use them in a planned manner to focus on the most direct aspects of breaking through long-term difficulties and promoting social vitality. The concentration of production factors is the basis for the concentration and exertion of social forces, the prerequisite for economic development and political consolidation. Under the capitalist system, capitalists accumulate and concentrate capital through the mechanism of exploitation, which is the basis for the development of capitalism. However, in a backward society, capitalism has lost its development potential, and capital accumulation is stagnant due to external imperialist exploitation. If China wants to break free from the plight, it can only concentrate and use resources in a socialized manner under the system of public ownership, to accomplish the epoch-making tasks that cannot be completed under the capitalist system of ownership. "Heshang" seems to overly emphasize the inertia of agricultural civilization and traditional psychology, listing the stages of New Democracy and socialism, where part of the old psychological state has not been eliminated from national life, into the category of the old cultural stage, ignoring the revolutionary changes in the political and economic structure.

In fact, the class consciousness of the vast majority of Chinese workers and peasants has shown extremely significant changes during the revolution. From the passive attitude of "leaving it to heaven" to the strong desire for "self-liberation," it has gathered into a source of heat for wave after wave of massive mass movements, and the party is just the organizer of the movement. Although the party's leadership has been misled several times, the fundamental character and general direction of the system have been established one by one under the principles of socialism. From a semi-feudal, semi-colonial economic structure to a socialist economic structure, the fundamental change in the social base has been realized. Even if it still drags along some remnants of feudal culture, it should not confuse the historical evaluation of the social essence. However, the authors of "Heshang" view cultural criticism from a cultural leadership and quasi-ideological standpoint, regarding cultural criticism as the sole content of social criticism. This is the "Heshang" that diminishes the progressive view of historical materialism.

It cannot be denied that China's socialism is still in its primary stage. The inherent content of socialism has not yet completely taken the upper hand in the cultural field. One of the obvious problems in the reform stage is the bureaucratic privileges of cadres under the public ownership system and the selfish opportunism of the masses. In the previous few stages, the party's leadership has made mistakes, with both policy and technical errors.

The most serious problem is that individualism under the public ownership system can use public ownership as its shelter and cover, gradually corroding the public system from within. Individualism is actually a remnant of the consciousness of the old era of several thousand years, which has taken on a new form under the public ownership system, but it seems to be a necessary product of public ownership. In comparison, individualism under capitalist, private ownership, because it lacks this layer of shelter, can only pursue personal interests under personal responsibility, emphasize efficiency, tap potential, pursue the maximum effect, and establish a certain range of social cooperation and security guarantees. These are the advantages of individualist economic behavior under private ownership. These advantages inevitably make some intellectuals who are dissatisfied with the bureaucracy under the public ownership system and the low efficiency under the planned economy feel a natural longing for them.

Therefore, some people advocate modifying the public ownership system and restoring some private ownership, even advocating the full acceptance of capitalist values and political and economic systems. But these contemporary "Westernization theorists" are ignorant of the following facts: (1) Individualism still thrives under the public ownership system, and the most important reason, apart from the remnants of the old era, is that the productive forces of Chinese socialism have not yet reached the stage where the superiority of public ownership can be fully realized in personal consumption life. However, in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, the public ownership system has indeed established an unprecedentedly strong self-defense force in the history of modern China, realized a considerable scale of heavy industry foundation and basic construction, and guaranteed the basic survival rights of one billion people... These are undoubtedly the real results under the new production relations. It is just that because the starting point of productivity is too low, the cost of these achievements must be borne by the sacrifices in people's consumption life. But without the high concentration of social resources under the public ownership system, these achievements would be impossible to obtain through the capitalist operation route. (2) Indeed, the planned economy before the reform also accumulated the following defects: (1) The central planning agency cannot fully cover all departments of the national economy in the plan; (2) The planned economy is managed by administrative cadres, which easily leads to bureaucratization and cannot maintain the necessary flexibility; (3) Human planning can never completely overcome subjective one-sidedness; (4) There is often a state of imbalance between production and consumption, supply and demand. The above defects are mainly technical. But combined with the imbalances in the three sectors of production—heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture caused by policy deviations, it is also the reason why the consumption level of the people does not easily rise with the improvement of productivity. However, no matter what, the solid foundation of production is the guarantee for improving future consumption levels. China's socialist industrial structure has been established. Although it can still be adjusted to a certain extent in the range of supplementary productive forces, in individual consumer industries to meet the daily needs of the people, and thereby adjust the ownership system to a limited extent, the dominant role of socialist production relations is indeed the only basis for future development, which is beyond doubt.

As for the capitalist culture of the world that the "Westernization theorists" yearn for, it has indeed entered its decline. Monopoly-stage capitalism is inevitably showing various signs. The "capitalist value principles" of "science" and "democracy" emphasized in "Heshang" have already shown symptoms of hollowness and hypocrisy. Monopoly capitalism has lost the spontaneous rationalism of the free competition period and has formed another closed system similar to feudal autocracy. The original advantages of capitalist commodity economy, such as the improvement of labor productivity and the efficiency of product cost and quality circulation under the principle of competition, can indeed provide a mirror for socialist commodity production, but its ultimate stance of "self-interest" rather than "common interest" calculation, and the production anarchy that comes with it, has indeed led it to a path of destroying the future. All human values are dwarfed, even animalized. What is the purpose of life? What is the ultimate purpose of production and efficiency? Is there still room for ideals in the world? These seem to have become questions without answers. Under the highest principle of capital appreciation, everything becomes a gray world of quantification.

So, what is the cultural content of socialism? It is the sublation of human conflict. It is a non-coercive, naturalized, free development of "I for everyone, everyone for me." Whether it is capital or production, it is truly for people, not for capital or production. Such a socialist culture is truly blue, full of hope, opportunities, happiness, and the confluence of all streams.

However, the road to "blue" is not smooth. The heavy burden of thousands of years of feudal, semi-feudal, and semi-colonial forms is indeed a major obstacle to reform. But the Chinese people have not chosen the wrong path. It's just that the ruggedness and difficulty on the road have exceeded expectations. To keep moving forward, what should be discarded should not be cherished, and what should be cherished should be firmly adhered to. Between taking and discarding, principles and means should be considered simultaneously. The science and democracy of socialism, which have already transcended class limitations, are the two pillars of the new culture of the future, but they can only gradually take shape and grow in the steady development of the socialist political and economic system, not in the capitalist learning movement centered on the individual. In this regard, the inspirational power of "Heshang" cannot be said to be seriously lacking.

An institution, as long as it is the result of the majority's desire for progress and social rationality, and has been tested by social practice, will be an objective social existence. It is a normative force that transcends personal subjective evaluation, with positive effects but also necessarily with negative effects. Because of the historical limitations of practice and the definite complexity of social composition, the problems produced are inevitable for any institutional structure in any era. If in the process of development, the negative effects overcome the positive effects, that is the time of "mutation." If the positive effects continue to overcome the negative effects, that is the normal process of sublation. To consider both aspects of dialectical interaction is the essence of criticism.

The pros and cons of socialist production relations, public ownership of production means, may have multiple manifestations under specific historical and social conditions, but their essential meaning is determined. From the original form of animal instinct to the developed form of social rationality, there may be twists and turns in small stages, but in large stages, it is irreversible. Otherwise, the progressive view of human society as a branch of the universe would be untenable.

    从“河殇”论大陆西化派
    郭仲
    近几年来，中国大陆知识界掀起了一股对历史发展反思的热潮，最为异军突起的是一群以唯心论史观批判中国历史发展及思考中国未来走向的西化派，《河殇》的作者群可以说是典型，因其以电视节目制作来进行反思而轰动一时。本文虽针对《河殇》原著进行批判，其中主要论点也可视为对大陆一般西化派的总批判。
  （一）有关中国近代史发展轨迹的问题
    中国曾经是一个半封建半殖民地社会。当中国在本世纪初脱离了数千年封建王朝的支配时，世界已经处在资本帝国主义宰割下的状态中。中国社会无法在足够的、自力的资本积累条件下由资本主义来顺利接替封建经济体制。中国的资本主义在帝国主义强势干扰压榨下无力获取正常发展的机会。传统土地资本难于顺利转化成现代工商资本，唯有沦为半封建半殖民地的特异性格。
      一个先进的农业文明，不至于对后进的另一农业社会产生经济的抑制作用。但一个资本主义国家，其生产力达到一定水平后，对后进地区的资本主义是铁定发生强力的压迫和抑制作用。这是由于资本主义生产关系中的自发膨胀性和侵他性的特质所致。因此《河殇》文中多处强调中国的内陆农业文明妨碍了资本主义工商业的萌芽和成长，并不完全正确。以农立国的封建王朝刻意维持一种卑视工商业活动的政策和文化理念是常见的现象。即使在欧洲，在中世纪封建时期也莫不如此。教会法甚至以收受利息为罪恶。但中世纪文化，轻视工商业，并没有真正抑制了欧洲的前资本主义的原始积累的进行。经济是具有自力发展的机制的。最后还是克服了传统文化的束缚而逐渐茁壮。即使是十三、十四世纪意大利半岛上的商业城邦，虽然在海外贸易和远地商业方面盛极一时，但其银行作业还是偷钻教会法的间隙，饱受一般民众的诅咒而成长起来。
      中国农业文明因其成熟的秩序性和稳定性，当它变成历史包袱时，阻碍作用也比欧陆封建更大。这虽然也是事实，但中国文明也有其相对合理主义的一面（曾使近世欧洲启蒙时代的知识人倾倒），且少有持续性的宗教狂热的压抑。中国封建阶级的闭锁性也不如欧洲血统主义的严密。相比之下宁可说是半开放性的阶级制度。所以中国资本主义未发达的理由，与其说是为传统文化观念所累，不如说是起步稍晚而遇到了帝国主义世纪。像日本，其传统中的中国要素是主要成分，封建锁国的历史又无异于中国，只因起步于前世纪70年代，彼时欧洲列强尚未进入经济的帝国主义阶段，维新后的日本趁着宝贵的三十年时间急速地资本主义化了。
  （二）对资本主义发展史的认识问题
      《河殇》主题急欲突破封建传统意识形态，对资本主义的高生产力高效率表现出欣羡，有意无意美化理想化了资本主义，全篇不曾出现资本主义批判的文字。有人说《河殇》创作的目的在于封建意识批判而不是资本主义批判。然而，突破旧传统的束缚“走向海洋”后，这个海洋目前无疑是资本主义占优势的商品经济的大海，则资本主义批判也应该是全篇结构中不可缺少的部分。否则，被我们视为可成为中国经济现代化契机的资本主义“积极要素”，将会与其
  “消极要素”紧密结合在一起，不分优劣地流进中国。只向往资本主义光明的一面而无视其黑暗的一面，是盲动兼被动，恐怕将使改革的未来充满新的危机。
    具体而言，不能因强调传统之短而对资本主义表示无条件的崇尚。不要忘记资本主义的发达史同时也是资本主义残酷史。他的发达是在残酷的营运上面构筑出来的。它的“残酷”，不止于是伦理的罪，同时也是科学的恶。虽然一时积累了财富，但也建立了一种破坏未来的系统。
    古老沉滞的农业文明，不能一味羡慕资本主义的高生产力、高效率，而一厢情愿、企图透过学习而赶上。后进的资本主义永远赶不上先进资本主义。这就是资本主义的铁则。除非采取另一种体制，建立主动的平行互利关系，这样才能取其长而不蒙其害。文中所谓：“中国要走向世界，也要让世界走进中国”。交流当然是双向的，但强势资本主义国家惯于挟其实力地位，进行名为公平、实际不公平的交换。所谓的“世界商品经济的大海”，看似能提供一些处方来医治低效率计划经济的诸种宿疾；但我们也不要忘记，商品经济的合理基础在于等价原则，和供需关系的自动调整。然而资本主义的商品经济、万般商品的等价原则植基于劳资间的不等价交换。而供需关系在独占资本的政治性运作下，那一双灵敏的“看不见的手”早已萎化，此时资本主义商品经济体系能带给社会主义计划经济的“补足条件”，除了部分剩余资本与二手技术外，就是私利动机的重新肯定。
      当然，即使如此，学习与交流的意义还是相当大的。毕竟西欧资本主义在不同于中国的历史条件下，有过他们的辉煌的实践成果，构成了世界文明中的一股主流。中国虽在走自己的路但绝不可能是孤独的路。资本主义的成就已经是世界文明中的公产，有些是必需的传承因素。只是中国要有正确的接纳办法，积极但理智地去面向“大海”。
  （三）对中国式社会主义的认识问题
    中国以一个半封建半殖民地社会，经过新民主主义走上社会主义的路，是否错误的历史选择呢？《河殇》全篇不曾出现正面肯定的措词。它只强调改革的内容是科学与民主的“导入”，且这种新的价值原则是经由资产阶级革命成功而确立的。似乎表示中国没有发展资本主义所以缺少科学与民主，社会主义的中国因而也缺少科学与民主。虽然《河殇》高唱科学与民主，却对民主与科学不曾做出应有的诠释，不能不说是一种轻率。其实，科学与民主不是具有固定内容的价值实体，而是不断进步的过程。如果用抽象意义来表达，科学是实事求是，民主是尊重群体中的每一位成员。至于它的具体内容，是同时具有阶段性中的“突破性”和“限制性”的。当资产阶级欲突破封建体制的桎梏时，的确是以科学与民主做为对抗中世纪的神权与王权的精神势力和阶梯式的身份制度的。但如此的“突破性”却在革命胜利掌握了政权之日，变成了新的“限制性”了。为了确保其生产关系中和统治关系中的优越地位，科学在资产阶级手中分裂为“自然科学”的“唯物论”和“人文科学”的“唯心论”。而民主也只止于“形式民主”而不及于“实质民主”。甚至以形式民主来掩盖实质的不民主，以政治的民主外衣来保护经济的不民主实态。
    中国之所以不曾选择资本主义的路，并非纯主观的意识所决定，而是有其客观必然的理由。如果资本主义的路的确“走得通”，任何力量都阻止不了它。像中国这样的落后社会，生产力水平低，在群体生存的急迫需要下如想摆脱任人宰割的困境，唯有把有限的社会资源——包括人力、物力所构成的生产力，从旧生产关系的羁绊下解放，统筹集中加以重点式的运用，用到突破长期困境、促动社会命脉最直接的方面去。生产要素的集中利用是社会力的凝结与发挥的基础，是经济发展和政治巩固的前提条件。在资本主义体制下，资本家通过剥削机制累积和集中资本，那是资本主义的发展凭据。然而在落后社会，资本主义已失去了发展潜能，资本积累因外在帝国主义的啜吸而停滞。中国如欲摆脱困境，唯有在社会化的所有制下做计划性集中运用，实现资本主义所有制下无法完成的划时代任务。《河殇》中似乎太强调农业文明与传统心理的惰性，把新民主主义、社会主义阶段也因部分心理旧态未能从国家生活中清除，而将其列入旧文化阶段的范畴中，忽视了发生在政经结构中的革命性变革。
    其实，中国的广大工农群众的阶级自觉，在革命过程中曾经呈现出极其显著的变化。由“听天由命”的消极心态到“自我解放”的强烈欲求，汇聚而成为一波又一波的巨大群众运动的热源，而党只是运动的组织者。虽然党的领导几次发生了误导，然而制度的根本性格和大方向总是在社会主义原则下一一被策定建立。由半封建半殖民地的经济结构到社会主义经济结构，社会基础的巨变既已实现，即使还拖着封建文化的某些残渣，也不应该混淆社会本质的历史评估。但《河殇》的作者群却从文化挂帅的、近乎观念论的立场，视文化批判为社会批判的唯一内容。这就是《河殇》矮化了唯物史观的进步观。
      不可否认，中国的社会主义至今还停留在它的初级阶段。社会主义的应有内涵在文化领域中还没有完全占取优势。在改革阶段中显见的问题之一，是公有制下干部的官僚特权主义和群众的自私投机主义。前此几个阶段中，党的领导发生了错误，政策性、技术性错误都有。
    真正严重的是，公有制下的个人主义能以公有制为其庇护和掩盖，从内部日渐腐蚀公有制度。个人主义其实是几千年旧时代的残留意识，此时在公有制下取得了新的表现形态而已，却宛如公有制的必然产物。相比之下，资本主义的、私有制下的个人主义，因为没有这一层庇护，唯有在个人责任下追求个人利益，讲究效率，发挥潜力，追求最大效果，且能建立一定范围的社会协作和安全保障。这些都是私有制下个人主义经济行为的长处。这些长处难免使一部分不满公有制下的官僚主义和计划经济下的低效率的知识分子，对其油然产生憧憬心理。
    于是有人提倡修改公有制、回复某种私有制，甚至主张全面接受资本主义价值观的政经制度。但这些当代的“西化论”者昧于如下的几点事实：（一）公有制下仍然滋长个人主义，除了旧时代残留意识外，最主要的原因是中国社会主义的生产力尚未达到在个人消费生活方面充分落实公有制的优越性的地步。但建国40年以来，公有制确在原本落后贫穷的中国建立起民族近代史上空前强大的自卫力，实现了相当规模的重工业基础和基本建设，十亿人口的生存权的基本保障……等。这些无疑都是新生产关系下的现实成果。只是因为生产力的起点太低，这种成就的代价全得由人民消费生活中的牺牲来承担。但如无公有制下的社会资源的高度集中，这些成果是绝无可能经由资本主义营运路线得到的。（二）诚然，改革前的计划经济也累积了如下的缺陷：（1）中央计划机关在计划中难于全面涵盖国民经济中的所有部门的实况；（2）计划经济在管理上被委之于行政干部之手，易于酿成官僚化弊端并无法保持应有的机动性；（3）人为计划总是无法完全克服主观片面性；（4）生产与消费、供给与需要之间常有失衡状态。以上这些缺陷，主要属于技术方面的多。但再加上来自政策偏差所造成的生产三部门——重工业、轻工业、农业的比例失衡，亦是国民生活的消费水平不易随着生产力的提升而提高的原因。不过无论如何，厚植生产的基本架构，才是提高未来消费水平的保障。中国社会主义的产业结构既已建成，纵然在一定范围内还可以配置补助性生产力，在个体消费财产业方面以满足人民的日常需求，且因而有限调整所有制方式，但社会主义生产关系的主导性，确是未来唯一发展基础，是不容置疑的。
    至于“西化论”者所向往的世界资本主义文化，也确已走进了它的衰退期。独占阶段的资本主义已无可避免地呈现出种种征候。《河殇》文中大力强调的“科学”与“民主”的“资本主义价值原则”，早已显出空洞化和虚伪化的症状。独占资本主义已丧失了自由竞争时期的自发的合理主义，形成了类似于封建专制的另一种封闭系统。资本主义商品经济原有的优点，如在竞争原理下劳动生产性的提高和产品的成本品质流通方面的效率化等，虽也可以使社会主义商品生产有所借镜，但它的终究是“私利”而非“共利”的损益计算立场，和由此而来的生产无政府，确已使其走上了破坏未来的不归路。一切人性价值都被侏儒化，甚至动物化。人生的目的是什么？生产和效率的终究目的在哪里？人间还有理想的存在余地否？这些似乎都成为没有答案的感喟。在资本增值的最高原则统辖之下，一切都变成了灰色的量化世界。
      那么，社会主义的文化内涵又是什么，那是人与人冲突性的扬弃。非强制性的，自然化了的，我为人人、人人为我的自由发展的文化。资本也好，生产也好，都是真正的为了人，而不是人为了资本、为了生产。这样的社会主义文化才是真正蔚蓝色的，充满希望、机会、幸福的、万流汇聚的大海。
      只是通往“蔚蓝”的路不是平坦的。数千年封建、半封建半殖民地形态的沉重包袱，的确是改革的重大障碍。但中国人并没有找错了路。只是路上的崎岖艰难，一时超过了预想。为了不停向前走，该丢弃的不应留恋，该珍惜的也要坚持贯彻，取舍去就之间，同时顾及原则与手段。社会主义的、已行扬弃了阶级局限性的科学与民主，是未来崭新文化的两大支柱，却唯有在社会主义的政经制度的稳步发展中逐渐具形和成长，而不是在以个人为中心的资本主义学习运动中所能获得。就这一点而言，《河殇》的启发力不能不说是严重的不足。
      一种制度，只要是多数人企求进步的社会理性的结果，经过了社会实践的检证，将是一种客观的社会存在。那是超越个人主观评价的规范力量，具有正作用，却也必兼有副作用。因为实践的历史局限和社会构成的一定复杂性所产生的问题，是任何时代的制度结构都将难免的。若在发展中副作用克制了正作用，那是“异变”的时刻。若正作用一直克服着副作用，那是正常的扬弃过程。能兼顾两方面的辩证互动，才是批评的要旨。
      社会主义生产关系，公有生产手段的利弊，在特定的历史社会条件下可能有多面表象，但其本质意义是确定的。由动物本能的原基形态到社会理性的发展形态，小阶段中容或有曲折浮沉，大阶段是不可逆行的。否则，做为宇宙存在的一支的人类社会，它的进步观也就无由谈起了。
