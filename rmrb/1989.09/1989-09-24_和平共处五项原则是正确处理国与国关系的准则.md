The Chinese government has now been three months since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing. Over the past three months, the international community has gained a more comprehensive and objective understanding of the truth and nature of this incident. Lies and rumors have gradually lost their market, and more and more countries have expressed "understanding" and "support" for the Chinese government's suppression of the riot. Some countries have even begun to change their stance and are prepared to restore and further develop political, economic, and cultural relations with China. We believe this is a rational and realistic consideration and is welcome.

However, just as many countries are re-evaluating and reassessing their policies towards China and adjusting their actions, some people in Western countries have issued discordant voices, proposing some bizarre arguments. They openly propose that the restoration and development of relations with China should be based on "China's government respecting basic human rights" and "implementing genuine reform and opening up." Some even propose that "economic cooperation should be exchanged for democracy." Recently, the seven major Western countries issued a so-called "China resolution" at their summit, openly condemning us for "ignoring human rights" and demanding that we "create conditions" to restore the "basis" for cooperation with the West. In China-Western relations, some Western leaders openly pressure us to change our domestic policies as a precondition for improving relations. This is rare in international relations and cannot but draw our serious attention.

In international relations, relations between countries should be equal, and no country has the right to interfere in another country's internal affairs as a condition for improving bilateral relations. If they insist on the aforementioned precondition, it is sheer hegemony and power politics. We cannot accept such rude interference in our internal affairs.

We have repeatedly stated, and a large amount of material has shown, that the riot that occurred in Beijing was orchestrated and incited by a small number of people behind the scenes. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic. It was by no means, as some Western media outlets have distorted, a so-called movement for democracy and human rights. Suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot was a life-and-death struggle concerning China's future and destiny, a necessary measure to defend the socialist system and ensure that reform and opening up proceed in the correct direction. No government would allow such disturbances and riots to spread unchecked. The Chinese government took measures to stop the riot based on China's actual situation. This approach may not be to the liking of some Western countries, but it cannot be used as a reason for interference. Even those Western countries that are fervently criticizing us have experienced various disturbances and have taken measures to suppress them. We do not interfere in their internal affairs because we have different views on these events, nor do we impose our views on others, let alone propose preconditions for improving relations. What right do some people in Western countries have to be so arrogant and meddle in purely Chinese internal affairs?

It should be noted that some Western politicians have also proposed that a condition for improving relations with China is for China to "return to the policy of reform and opening up" and "implement genuine reform and opening up." This statement itself is extremely absurd.

Over the past decade, China's reform and opening up have achieved tremendous success, which is evident to the world. After suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Chinese leaders have repeatedly reaffirmed that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change, and China's steps towards reform and opening up will be more stable, better, and even faster. This is well known. In this context, why do some people in Western countries keep harping on about China "implementing genuine reform and opening up"? In essence, it is because China's reform and opening up is based on the Four Cardinal Principles, which does not suit their tastes. What they mean by "genuine reform and opening up" is that the Chinese people should not act according to their own national conditions but should follow their instructions and carry out reform and opening up according to their wishes and models. This is a miscalculation. We want to tell these people that the choice of social system by the Chinese people and the direction of reform and opening up are entirely China's own business, and others have no right to interfere. Practice has proven that reform and opening up based on the Four Cardinal Principles is a policy that suits China's national conditions and is effective. It has the support of all the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people will never abandon the Four Cardinal Principles, the foundation of the state, nor will they block the path of reform and opening up, the road to national strength.

It is widely recognized that an important principle to be strictly adhered to in international relations is non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Regardless of the size, strength, or whether a country is rich or poor, all countries should be treated equally, respect each other's sovereignty, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. History has proven that this is the correct principle for handling relations between countries.

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs originated during the French Revolution. At that time, the French Republic proposed this principle to counter the interference of European feudal monarchies in its revolution. However, in the subsequent history, this principle was not truly implemented. Due to the aggressive, plundering, and enslaving policies of colonialism and imperialism, countless conflicts, massacres, and wars occurred, making non-interference in internal affairs an empty phrase. After World War II, in light of the historical lessons of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs being trampled upon by fascist aggressors, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs was confirmed in the United Nations Charter and subsequent important international legal documents. With the independence of many Asian, African, and Latin American colonies, the call to oppose imperialist interference and aggression grew louder. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by China and other countries, were solemnly included in the Bandung Conference communiqu√©. Since then, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, as the antithesis of hegemony, have become increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts and have been widely welcomed by countries around the world. Over the past 30-plus years, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have withstood the test of international vicissitudes and have been proven to be correct principles for handling relations between countries. Adhering to these principles is of great significance for maintaining world peace and stability. On the contrary, if these principles are violated, not only will relations between countries not improve, but conflicts, confrontations, and even wars will be triggered, the international atmosphere will be greatly poisoned, and the world will be in turmoil.

History and reality tell us that no matter how much hegemony and power politics are hated and strongly condemned, and no matter how much the practice of interfering in the internal affairs of others is despised and universally opposed, there will always be some people who regard themselves as international "judges" and take it upon themselves to interfere in the internal affairs of others, and arbitrarily criticize everything that does not suit their tastes. This struggle between interference and anti-interference continues to this day. But the world today is not the same as it was in the past, and any country that tries to act as the world's "judge" is doomed to fail.

At present, it is noteworthy that some people in the world are spreading the idea that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have "become outdated," and that the most popular value today is "human rights." This view is groundless and very harmful.

Due to the different social systems, ideologies, and value concepts of various countries, as well as the vast differences in cultural traditions and customs, different countries have different understandings of human rights, which is a natural thing. The Chinese government has always attached importance to human rights issues. The Constitution and laws of our country guarantee that our citizens enjoy extensive rights, including various individual rights. But human rights are not absolute. The exercise of any right and freedom is both protected by law and cannot be without legal constraints. Our country, in accordance with the Constitution and laws, suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, which is a completely different matter from human rights. The current problem is that some people in Western countries always regard their values as absolute truths and international standards that must be universally followed, and use them as criteria to measure and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. This is an expression of power politics. They advocate that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have "become outdated" and attempt to replace the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with their own value concepts as guidelines for handling relations between countries. If this is done, every country will impose its own social system and value concepts on others. Then, what international relations guidelines will there be? Will the world not be in chaos? It can be seen that some Western countries' high-sounding "human rights" are false, and interfering in internal affairs is the real intention. This tells us that the struggle over whether to uphold or oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is still sharp today. At the same time, this also proves that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not only not outdated but also have more urgent practical significance today. Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should become the guidelines for solving international political and economic problems," and proposed to establish a new international political order based on this.

Here, we reiterate once again: No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people will, as always, uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, uphold the guidelines for international relations, and actively develop friendly and cooperative relations with countries around the world. The 40-year history of New China has proven: China is a principled and trustworthy country. It does not yield to any external pressure and will never trade principles. Today, we will not accept the preconditions that some Western countries attempt to impose on us. Now, some abnormalities in the relations between some Western countries and our country are not our responsibility. To make the country prosperous and strong, China will continue to reform and open up, and the door that has been opened will not be closed again. The key to restoring and developing normal relations with China lies with these Western countries abandoning their prejudices, broadening their vision, and adopting a wise policy towards China from a long-term perspective. We believe that as long as these Western countries change their shallow views and shortsighted practices, respect facts, respect the guidelines for international relations, and take proactive and positive steps, then the bilateral cooperative relations between our country and these countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will be restored and developed steadily.
