The Chinese government has now been three months since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing. Over the past three months, the international community has gained a more comprehensive and objective understanding of the truth and nature of this incident. Lies and rumors have gradually lost their market, and more and more countries have expressed "understanding" and "support" for the Chinese government's suppression of the riot. Some countries have even begun to change their stance and are prepared to restore and further develop political, economic, and cultural relations with China. We believe this is a rational and realistic consideration and is welcome.

However, just as many countries are re-evaluating and reassessing their policies towards China and adjusting their actions, some people in Western countries have issued discordant voices, proposing some bizarre arguments. They openly propose that the restoration and development of relations with China should be based on "China's government respecting basic human rights" and "implementing genuine reform and opening up." Some even propose that "economic cooperation should be exchanged for democracy." Recently, the seven major Western countries issued a so-called "China resolution" at their summit, openly condemning us for "ignoring human rights" and demanding that we "create conditions" to restore the "basis" for cooperation with the West. In China-Western relations, some Western leaders openly pressure us to change our domestic policies as a precondition for improving relations. This is rare in international relations and cannot but draw our serious attention.

In international relations, relations between countries should be equal, and no country has the right to interfere in another country's internal affairs as a condition for improving bilateral relations. If they insist on the aforementioned precondition, it is sheer hegemony and power politics. We cannot accept such rude interference in our internal affairs.

We have repeatedly stated, and a large amount of material has shown, that the riot that occurred in Beijing was orchestrated and incited by a small number of people behind the scenes. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic. It was by no means, as some Western media outlets have distorted, a so-called movement for democracy and human rights. Suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot was a life-and-death struggle concerning China's future and destiny, a necessary measure to defend the socialist system and ensure that reform and opening up proceed in the correct direction. No government would allow such disturbances and riots to spread unchecked. The Chinese government took measures to stop the riot based on China's actual situation. This approach may not be to the liking of some Western countries, but it cannot be used as a reason for interference. Even those Western countries that are fervently criticizing us have experienced various disturbances and have taken measures to suppress them. We do not interfere in their internal affairs because we have different views on these events, nor do we impose our views on others, let alone propose preconditions for improving relations. What right do some people in Western countries have to be so arrogant and meddle in purely Chinese internal affairs?

It should be noted that some Western politicians have also proposed that a condition for improving relations with China is for China to "return to the policy of reform and opening up" and "implement genuine reform and opening up." This statement itself is extremely absurd.

Over the past decade, China's reform and opening up have achieved tremendous success, which is evident to the world. After suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Chinese leaders have repeatedly reaffirmed that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change, and China's steps towards reform and opening up will be more stable, better, and even faster. This is well known. In this context, why do some people in Western countries keep harping on about China "implementing genuine reform and opening up"? In essence, it is because China's reform and opening up is based on the Four Cardinal Principles, which does not suit their tastes. What they mean by "genuine reform and opening up" is that the Chinese people should not act according to their own national conditions but should follow their instructions and carry out reform and opening up according to their wishes and models. This is a miscalculation. We want to tell these people that the choice of social system by the Chinese people and the direction of reform and opening up are entirely China's own business, and others have no right to interfere. Practice has proven that reform and opening up based on the Four Cardinal Principles is a policy that suits China's national conditions and is effective. It has the support of all the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people will never abandon the Four Cardinal Principles, the foundation of the state, nor will they block the path of reform and opening up, the road to national strength.

It is widely recognized that an important principle to be strictly adhered to in international relations is non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Regardless of the size, strength, or whether a country is rich or poor, all countries should be treated equally, respect each other's sovereignty, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. History has proven that this is the correct principle for handling relations between countries.

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs originated during the French Revolution. At that time, the French Republic proposed this principle to counter the interference of European feudal monarchies in its revolution. However, in the subsequent history, this principle was not truly implemented. Due to the aggressive, plundering, and enslaving policies of colonialism and imperialism, countless conflicts, massacres, and wars occurred, making non-interference in internal affairs an empty phrase. After World War II, in light of the historical lessons of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs being trampled upon by fascist aggressors, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs was confirmed in the United Nations Charter and subsequent important international legal documents. With the independence of many Asian, African, and Latin American colonies, the call to oppose imperialist interference and aggression grew louder. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by China and other countries, were solemnly included in the Bandung Conference communiqué. Since then, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, as the antithesis of hegemony, have become increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts and have been widely welcomed by countries around the world. Over the past 30-plus years, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have withstood the test of international vicissitudes and have been proven to be correct principles for handling relations between countries. Adhering to these principles is of great significance for maintaining world peace and stability. On the contrary, if these principles are violated, not only will relations between countries not improve, but conflicts, confrontations, and even wars will be triggered, the international atmosphere will be greatly poisoned, and the world will be in turmoil.

History and reality tell us that no matter how much hegemony and power politics are hated and strongly condemned, and no matter how much the practice of interfering in the internal affairs of others is despised and universally opposed, there will always be some people who regard themselves as international "judges" and take it upon themselves to interfere in the internal affairs of others, and arbitrarily criticize everything that does not suit their tastes. This struggle between interference and anti-interference continues to this day. But the world today is not the same as it was in the past, and any country that tries to act as the world's "judge" is doomed to fail.

At present, it is noteworthy that some people in the world are spreading the idea that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have "become outdated," and that the most popular value today is "human rights." This view is groundless and very harmful.

Due to the different social systems, ideologies, and value concepts of various countries, as well as the vast differences in cultural traditions and customs, different countries have different understandings of human rights, which is a natural thing. The Chinese government has always attached importance to human rights issues. The Constitution and laws of our country guarantee that our citizens enjoy extensive rights, including various individual rights. But human rights are not absolute. The exercise of any right and freedom is both protected by law and cannot be without legal constraints. Our country, in accordance with the Constitution and laws, suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, which is a completely different matter from human rights. The current problem is that some people in Western countries always regard their values as absolute truths and international standards that must be universally followed, and use them as criteria to measure and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. This is an expression of power politics. They advocate that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have "become outdated" and attempt to replace the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with their own value concepts as guidelines for handling relations between countries. If this is done, every country will impose its own social system and value concepts on others. Then, what international relations guidelines will there be? Will the world not be in chaos? It can be seen that some Western countries' high-sounding "human rights" are false, and interfering in internal affairs is the real intention. This tells us that the struggle over whether to uphold or oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is still sharp today. At the same time, this also proves that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not only not outdated but also have more urgent practical significance today. Recently, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should become the guidelines for solving international political and economic problems," and proposed to establish a new international political order based on this.

Here, we reiterate once again: No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people will, as always, uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, uphold the guidelines for international relations, and actively develop friendly and cooperative relations with countries around the world. The 40-year history of New China has proven: China is a principled and trustworthy country. It does not yield to any external pressure and will never trade principles. Today, we will not accept the preconditions that some Western countries attempt to impose on us. Now, some abnormalities in the relations between some Western countries and our country are not our responsibility. To make the country prosperous and strong, China will continue to reform and open up, and the door that has been opened will not be closed again. The key to restoring and developing normal relations with China lies with these Western countries abandoning their prejudices, broadening their vision, and adopting a wise policy towards China from a long-term perspective. We believe that as long as these Western countries change their shallow views and shortsighted practices, respect facts, respect the guidelines for international relations, and take proactive and positive steps, then the bilateral cooperative relations between our country and these countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will be restored and developed steadily.

    和平共处五项原则是正确处理国与国关系的准则
    本报特约评论员
    中国政府平息发生在北京的反革命暴乱已经三个多月了。三个多月来，国际社会对这场风波的真相和性质有了更全面、更客观公正的认识和了解，谎言和谣言日渐失去市场，越来越多的国家对我国政府平息暴乱表示“理解”和“支持”，还有一些国家开始改变立场，准备恢复并进一步发展对华政治、经济和文化关系。我们认为，这是一种理智和现实的考虑，是值得欢迎的。
    然而，就在许多国家重新衡量和评估对华政策、调整自己的行动之时，西方国家的某些人却发出了极不协调的声音，提出了一些离奇的论调。他们公然提出恢复和发展同中国的关系要“以中国政府尊重基本人权”和“实行真正的改革和开放”为“先决条件”。有的甚至提出什么要“以经济合作换民主”。前不久，西方7国首脑会议通过了一个所谓“中国问题”的决议，公然谴责我们
  “无视人权”，要我们“创造条件”以恢复和西方合作的“基础”。在对华关系中，西方国家某些当政者公然逼迫我们改变国内政策，作为改善关系的先决条件，这是国际关系中所罕见的，不能不引起我们的严重注意。
    在国际关系中，国与国之间的关系应该是平等的，任何国家都无权以干涉别国内部事务作为改善两国关系的条件。如果坚持上述的先决条件，就是十足的强权政治和霸权主义，对于这种粗暴干涉我国内部事务的做法，中国人民理所当然是不能接受的。
    我们已经多次讲过，而且大量的材料也已经表明，发生在北京的这一场风波，是极少数人在幕后策划和挑动的，其目的在于推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的人民共和国，它决不像某些西方新闻机构所歪曲的那样，是一场所谓的争取民主和人权的运动。平息反革命暴乱，是一场关系到中国前途和命运的殊死斗争，是捍卫社会主义制度、保证改革开放沿着正确方向发展的必要之举。任何一个政府，都不会容许这样的动乱和暴乱任意蔓延。中国政府根据我国的现实情况采取了制止暴乱的措施，这一做法不一定合乎某些西方国家的胃口，但这决不能成为横加干涉的理由。即使那些起劲地指责我们的西方国家，国内也发生过种种的骚乱，采取过平息骚乱的措施，我们并不因为对这些事件有不同的看法而干预它们的内政，不把我们的观点强加于人，甚至提出什么改善关系的先决条件。西方国家的一些人有什么权利对纯属中国内政的事情如此蛮横地一再指手划脚呢？
    这里需要指出的是，一些西方政界人士还提出改善对华关系的一个条件是要中国重新“回到改革、开放的政策上来”，“实行真正的改革和开放”，这种提法本身就极其荒谬。
    中国实行改革、开放十年来已经取得了巨大成就，这是全世界有目共睹的。平息北京发生的反革命暴乱以后，中国领导人曾多次重申，中国改革开放的政策不变，中国改革开放的步子将迈得更稳、更好、甚至更快。这也是人所共知的。在这种情况下，西方国家有些人士还喋喋不休地要求中国“实行真正的改革和开放”是什么意思呢？说穿了，就因为中国实行的是在坚持四项基本原则基础上的改革开放，不对他们的胃口，他们所谓“真正的改革和开放”，是什么含意呢，就是要中国人民不是根据自己的国情，而是要听从他们的指挥，按照他们的愿望和模式来进行改革和开放。这是打错了算盘。我们要告诉这些人，中国人民选择什么样的社会制度，改革开放沿什么方向发展，这完全是中国自己的事，别人无权干涉。实践已经证明，坚持四项基本原则基础上的改革开放，是符合中国国情并行之有效的政策，得到了全中国人民的拥护。中国政府和人民决不会背弃四项基本原则这一立国之本，也决不会堵塞改革开放这条强国之路。
    人所公认，国际关系中应当严格遵循的一个重要原则就是不干涉别国的内政。国家不论大小强弱，也不论是穷国富国，都应一律平等，互相尊重主权，互不干涉内政。历史证明，这是处理国与国之间关系的正确原则。
    不干涉内政原则产生于法国大革命时期。当时法兰西共和国为反对欧洲封建专制王朝对其革命进行干涉而提出了这一原则。但是，在其后的历史中这一原则并未真正实行。由于殖民主义、帝国主义疯狂推行侵略、掠夺和奴役殖民地的政策，导致了无数次的冲突、残杀和战争，不干涉内政只是一句空话。第二次世界大战后，鉴于不干涉内政原则遭到法西斯侵略势力空前践踏的历史教训，不干涉内政原则在《联合国宪章》及其后一系列重要的国际法律文件中都得到了确认。随着广大亚非拉殖民地国家的独立，反对帝国主义干涉和侵略的呼声越来越高，1955年万隆会议上，由中国等国倡导的和平共处五项原则郑重地写进了万隆会议公报。此后，和平共处五项原则作为强权政治的对立物，越来越深入人心，受到世界各国的普遍欢迎。30多年来，和平共处五项原则经受了国际风云变幻的考验，被证明是经得起时间检验的处理国与国之间关系的正确原则。坚持这些原则，对于维护世界的和平与稳定具有重要意义，相反，如果这些原则遭到破坏，不要说国与国之间的关系不能改善，而且会触发矛盾、冲突甚至战争，国际气氛就会大大毒化，世界就会动荡不宁。
    历史和现实的经验都告诉我们，不管霸权主义和强权政治多么遭人痛恨，受到强烈的谴责；不管干涉别国内政的行径多么为世人所不齿，遭到各国普遍反对，但世界上总有一些人以国际“法官”自居，以干涉别国内政为己任，对一切不合他们意的事情，横加指责。这种干涉与反干涉的斗争至今仍在继续。但当今世界已非昔日可比，任何国家想要充当世界的“法官”，都是注定要失败的。
      目前，值得注意的是，世界上有人散布一种论调，说什么和平共处五项原则已经
  “过时”，当今最流行的价值观是“人权”。这种观点是毫无根据的，也是十分有害的。
      由于世界各国社会制度不同，意识形态和价值观念各异，加上文化传统、风俗习惯千差万别，对于人权，不同的国家有着不同的理解，这本来是很自然的事。我国政府一向重视人权问题。我国的宪法和法律保障了我国公民享有广泛的权利，包括个人的各种权利。但人权不是绝对的。任何权利和自由的行使既受到法律的保护，又不能不受法律的制约。我国根据宪法和法律平息反革命暴乱，这与人权问题是性质完全不同的两码事。现在的问题是西方国家有些人总是把他们的价值观看作是绝对真理和国际上必须共同遵守的准则，并以此做为标准去衡量和干涉别国的内部事务，这是一种强权政治的表现。他们鼓吹和平共处五项原则已经“过时”，妄图以他们自己的价值观念代替和平共处五项原则作为处理国与国之间关系的准则。如果照此办理，每个国家都把自己的社会制度和价值观念强加于人，那还有什么国际关系准则可言？天下岂不乱套了吗？可见，某些西方国家高唱“人权”是假，行干涉内政才是真。这就告诉我们，围绕着维护还是反对和平共处五项原则，今天还存在着尖锐的斗争。同时，这也再一次证明，和平共处五项原则非但没有过时，而且坚持这些原则今天有着更为迫切的现实意义。最近邓小平同志指出：“和平共处五项原则应该成为解决国际政治问题和国际经济问题的准则”，并主张以此为基础建立国际政治新秩序。
    在这里我们再次重申：不管发生什么情况，中国政府和人民将一如既往，维护和平共处五项原则，维护国际关系的准则，积极发展同世界上各国的友好合作关系。新中国40年的历史证明：中国是一个讲原则、守信用的国家，她不屈从于任何外来压力，也决不拿原则做交易。今天，我们同样不会接受某些西方国家妄图强加给我们的先决条件。现在，某些西方国家同我国关系中出现的一些不正常现象，责任不在我们。为使国家繁荣昌盛，中国将继续改革开放，已经打开的大门不会重新关闭。解铃还需系铃人，恢复和发展正常的对华关系，关键在于这些西方国家抛弃偏见，把目光放远一些，从长远利益出发，采取明智的对华政策。我们相信，只要这些西方国家改变了那些浅薄的见识和短视的做法，尊重事实，尊重国际关系准则，采取主动积极的步骤，那么，我国和这些国家在和平共处五项原则基础上的双边合作关系，必将得到恢复和稳定的发展。
