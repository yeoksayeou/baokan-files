Chen Junsheng, at the national conference on poverty alleviation in ethnic minority areas, emphasized that the economic development, social prosperity, and people's prosperity in ethnic minority areas are matters of overall importance to the prosperity and strength of the entire Chinese nation. It is a great and arduous historical task to help ethnic minority areas fundamentally change their backward social, economic, and cultural conditions as soon as possible.

This conference was jointly convened by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas. The opening ceremony was presided over by Ma Jianying, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun attended the meeting.

It is reported that over the past decade of reform, under the correct guidance of the Party's ethnic policies, ethnic minority areas have undergone tremendous and profound changes. However, due to historical, geographical, political, and economic reasons, the overall development level of ethnic minority areas remains very low. In 1986, out of the 331 key counties supported by the state, 141 were ethnic minority poverty-stricken counties, accounting for 42.6%. In the future, the state will focus on poverty alleviation in ethnic minority areas as a key area of work.

Chen Junsheng said that whether or not we can solve the problem of subsistence for the people in ethnic minority areas is related to whether our Party's ethnic policies are truly implemented, whether the superiority of socialism is fully demonstrated, and whether various ethnic groups are united and harmonious. It is also related to the unity and long-term stability of the country. This is not only an economic issue but also a political issue.

He emphasized that the most important and fundamental thing to solve the problem of subsistence for the people in ethnic minority areas and promote their economic development is to adhere to the general policy of economic development. He said that according to the report of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas, the State Council has decided to implement more preferential policies and measures in industrial policies, the sale of agricultural and sideline products, reducing the burden on ethnic minority poverty-stricken areas, and increasing the investment of funds in ethnic minority poverty-stricken areas. All levels of government and relevant departments should conscientiously implement these.

He proposed that family planning should be taken as an important task in the poverty alleviation work in ethnic minority areas. Chen Junsheng also pointed out the need to strengthen the leadership of all levels of government in the poverty alleviation work in ethnic minority areas.

    陈俊生在全国少数民族地区扶贫工作会议上强调
　　民族地区扶贫事关全局
　　将列为今后工作重点并给予更优惠政策
    本报北京9月19日讯　记者袁建达、何加正报道：国务委员陈俊生今天在这里召开的全国少数民族地区扶贫工作会议上说，少数民族地区的经济发展、社会繁荣与人民富裕是关系到整个中华民族繁荣昌盛的全局性问题，尽快帮助少数民族地区从根本上改变社会经济文化的落后面貌，是一项伟大艰巨的历史性任务。
    这次会议是由国家民委和国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组联合召开的。全国政协副主席、国家民委主任司马义·艾买提主持了今天的开幕式。国务院副总理田纪云出席了会议。
    据悉，改革十年来，在党的正确的民族政策指导下，少数民族地区发生了巨大而深刻的变 化。但是，由于历史、地理、政治、经济等方面的原因，少数民族地区发展的整体水平依然很低。1986年国家重点扶持的331个贫困县中，少数民族贫困县有141个，占42.6％。今后，国家将把少数民族地区的扶贫作为扶贫工作的重点来抓。
    陈俊生说，能不能解决少数民族地区群众的温饱问题，关系到我们党的民族政策是不是真正落实，关系到社会主义优越性是否充分体现，也关系到各民族之间的团结和睦，关系到国家的统一和长治久安。这不仅是一个经济问题，也是一个政治问题。
    他着重指出，尽快解决少数民族地区群众的温饱问题，促进其经济发展，最重要、最根本的是坚持经济开发这一总的工作方针。他说，根据国家民委和国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组的报告，国务院已经决定在产业政策、农副产品销售、减轻民族贫困地区负担，增加民族贫困地区资金投入等方面实行更优惠的政策措施，各级政府和有关部门要认真贯彻执行。
    他提出，要把计划生育作为少数民族地区扶贫工作的一项重要任务。陈俊生还指出要强化各级政府对少数民族地区扶贫工作的领导。
