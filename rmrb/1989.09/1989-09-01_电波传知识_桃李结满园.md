At 39 years old, family English teacher Cecilia Lopez tunes in to her radio every evening, opens her textbook, and listens to the radio courses offered by Colombia's radio middle school. Several years ago, Cecilia, who had experienced the pain of not being able to attend school, began listening to this radio program. Recently, she finally graduated and is now preparing to study university courses.

Colombia's radio middle school was established in 1973 and was immediately welcomed by people from all walks of life. Initially, the school's teaching plan was aimed at urban residents, but in reality, farmers from the most remote villages in Colombia also tuned in to study. At first, the school only had one grade, but now it has 11 grades (each grade lasting 5 months). Over the past 16 years, 550,000 people have listened to its radio courses. Generally, after more than 5 years of study, students can reach the level of a high school graduate. This year, 700 people, including Cecilia, received their diplomas. Currently, there are 14,000 registered students. In terms of student numbers, no other school in Colombia can compare to this radio school, hence the nickname "Colombia's largest school."

The establishment of this radio school is mainly to provide opportunities for those who cannot or do not want to attend regular schools to learn cultural knowledge. For example, many housewives and working employees cannot leave their household chores or jobs to attend regular schools, but by enrolling in the radio school, they do not need to leave home to study and it does not affect their work. A small radio in hand solves the problem.

To ensure teaching quality, the school arranges courses and organizes teaching according to the national curriculum for middle schools, and has a strict examination system. Registered students must take exams administered by the Colombian Higher Education Promotion Committee after completing each grade's courses. Those who fail must retake the exam, with no limit on the number of attempts. Only those who pass can advance to the next grade. The school also has a question-and-answer team responsible for addressing learning problems raised by students in their letters and visits. For common problems, the school arranges special time slots on the radio to answer them; for individual problems, the school responds in writing.

To reduce the financial burden on students and enable more people to participate in learning, the school only charges for textbooks and does not collect any other fees. Even the textbook fees are lower than those of regular schools.

The radio school has no age restrictions for enrollment. Currently, the youngest student is 14 years old, the oldest is 68, and the average age is 25. Female students make up 60% of the total, and they are the most diligent learners. Cecilia is one of the outstanding ones: she studies in the mornings and evenings without missing work; even when she is bedridden, she insists on listening to the radio, afraid of falling behind; she records every lesson for review; and when she encounters problems she doesn't understand, she asks friends for help.

Colombia's radio middle school is well-run and renowned abroad. Bolivia and some Central American countries have sent experts to Colombia to learn from its experience and plan to start radio education.

    电波传知识　桃李结满园
    39岁的家庭英语教师塞西莉亚·洛佩斯每天晚上都按时打开收音机，翻开课本，收听哥伦比亚的广播中等学校课程。几年前，饱尝失学之苦的塞西莉亚就开始收听这个广播课程了。最近她终于毕业，现正准备攻读大学课程。
    哥伦比亚广播中等学校创办于1973年，一开始就受到各阶层人们的欢迎。最初，这个广播学校计划教学对象是大城市的市民，可实际上，哥伦比亚最偏远的小村庄的农民也收听学习。开始，这个广播学校只有一个年级，目前共有11个年级（每年级5个月时间课程）。16年来，共有55万人收听过它的广播课程。一般经过5年多的学习，都可达到中学毕业的水平。今年同塞西莉亚一起取得毕业文凭的有700人，目前在校注册生达1.4万人。就学生人数来讲，哥伦比亚没有任何一所学校可与这个广播学校相比，难怪哥伦比亚人称它是“哥伦比亚最大的学校”。
    创办这所广播学校，主要是为那些不能够或者不愿意上正规学校的人提供学习文化知识的机会。例如，许多家庭主妇和在职职员，不可能抛开家务或放弃工作到普通学校学习，而进广播学校，不需离家上学，也不影响上班。一只小小收音机在手就解决问题了。
    为保证教学质量，学校按照国家规定的中等学校教学大纲安排课程，组织教学，并有严格的考试制度。注册学生收听完每一个年级的课程都必须参加哥伦比亚高等教育促进委员会规定的考试。不及格者，必须补考，次数不限，考试及格才能升级。学校还设有一个答疑小组，负责学员来函来访中提出的学习中的问题。凡普遍性问题，安排专门时间在广播中解答；个别问题，回函解答。
    为了减轻学生经济上的负担，以便使更多的人参加学习，该校除教科书收费外，不再收取其他任何费用，即使书费也比正规学校低。
    广播学校招生不受年龄限制。目前学员中最小的14岁，最大的68岁，平均年龄25岁。女学员居多，占总数60％，她们学习也最努力。塞西莉亚就是其中的佼佼者：她利用早上和晚上时间学习，不误工作，即使卧病在床，也坚持收听广播，生怕拉下课；每次课都录音，以备复习；遇到不懂的问题，就请教朋友。
    哥伦比亚广播中等学校办学有方，驰誉国外。玻利维亚和一些中美洲国家派出专家到哥伦比亚考察取经，准备开办广播教育。
