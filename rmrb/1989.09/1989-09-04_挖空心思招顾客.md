All Bald Heads: In London, a small restaurant that was previously unknown managed to stand out in fierce competition and became extremely popular. The direct reason is that the restaurant's advertisement was particularly eye-catching: "Our food is the cleanest—you will never find a single hair in our soups or dishes!" The reason is that all the staff in the restaurant are bald!

Intentionally Making Mistakes: In a Paris shop, the advertisements in the window are always full of errors, sometimes making people laugh and cry at the same time. When someone kindly pointed out the mistakes, the boss smiled and said, "I did this on purpose. The goal is to make people think I am a fool, so they will want to come to my shop to buy things. Because the advertisements have grammatical errors, my sales have increased by three times."

Creating a Unique Clock: A restaurant in Switzerland, to attract customers, placed a unique clock at the entrance. The numbers on the clock are in reverse order compared to a normal clock. The restaurant owner believes that the time shown on this clock will make customers feel that it is "earlier" when they leave the restaurant than when they arrived, so they are willing to stay longer in the restaurant.

Handwritten Newspaper: Recently, a highly reputable newspaper in Belgium could not be published on time due to a computer malfunction. The editorial board immediately held a meeting and decided to handwrite all the articles using ballpoint pens. This method turned out to be the best advertisement: collectors were very interested in this unique newspaper, and it was quickly sold out in a few minutes.

    挖空心思招顾客
    全体谢顶　在伦敦，一家名不见经传的小饭店在激烈的竞争中竟独占鳌头，终日门庭若市。直接原因是该店的广告十分引人注目：“本店饮食卫生无与伦比——汤菜中任何时候见不到一根毛发！”原来饭店全体人员一律谢顶！
    存心出错　巴黎一家商店橱窗里的广告总是错误百出，有时令人啼笑皆非。当有人善意地指出错处时，老板却微笑着回答说：“我是故意这样作的，目的是让人以为我是个糊涂虫，因而愿意到我店里购货。因广告有语法错误，我的营业额扩大了3倍。”
    制造奇钟　瑞士一家饭店为招徕顾客，在饭店入口处放了一座奇特的钟。钟上的数字顺序与普通钟的相反。饭店老板认为，这座钟显示的时间会使客人觉得离开饭店比来时还“早”，因此，总愿在店里多坐一会。
    手抄报纸　前不久，比利时一份声誉颇高的报纸因计算机出故障不能按时出版。编委会立即开会，决定用圆珠笔抄写全部文章。这种作法竟然成为最佳广告：收藏家们对这份独一无二的报纸兴趣盎然，几分钟内报纸便被抢购一空。
