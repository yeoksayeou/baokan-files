Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze said in an article published in the September 11 issue of *Izvestia* that after shifting from confrontation to dialogue, the Soviet Union and the United States should take the next step and engage in constructive cooperation.

Shevardnadze made the remarks before the upcoming meeting between Soviet and American foreign ministers. It was announced that Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State Baker will meet in the United States from September 22 to 23.

Shevardnadze said that the necessary conditions have been created for the Soviet-American dialogue to enter a new stage, and the task of the two foreign ministers' meeting is to prepare for the new Soviet-American summit.

In his remarks, the Soviet foreign minister expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of actual nuclear disarmament. He believes that in some aspects, the current distance between the Soviet Union and the United States from reaching an agreement is even greater than during the previous U.S. administration. He said that negotiations on nuclear tests have practically stopped. He noted that in the previous round of negotiations on nuclear and space weapons, no agreement was reached on any important issue, and the reason is that the U.S. position has not changed.

Shevardnadze said that in the negotiations on nuclear and space weapons, it is now time to make principled and bold decisions, and only such decisions will lead to the quick signing of agreements.

Regarding Soviet-American bilateral relations, Shevardnadze said that the two countries now have about 40 intergovernmental agreements covering all sectors of the national economy. However, he believes that it is still too early to talk about a real leap in Soviet-American relations, and there are still many untapped possibilities in many aspects.

According to a report by TASS on September 11, the Soviet General Staff believes that the large-scale military exercises currently being conducted by NATO forces violate the statements made by NATO military and political leaders that the alliance is committed to peace and comprehensive security, and do not conform to their theory that the NATO military bloc is defensive in nature.

The report said that since early September, the territories of NATO countries have become training grounds, and about 20 large-scale combined-arms exercises, as well as air force and naval exercises, have begun simultaneously. The combined military exercise codenamed "Autumn Forge" involves 200,000 troops, 1,000 tanks, nearly 2,000 military aircraft, and about 400 warships.

　　谢瓦尔德纳泽在苏美外长会晤前说
　  苏美应进行建设性合作
　  苏抨击北约大规模军事演习
    新华社莫斯科9月11日电　苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽在11日的《消息报》上发表谈话说，苏美在从对抗转向对话之后，应当迈出下一步，即进行建设性的合作。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽是在苏美外长即将举行会晤之前发表这一谈话的。据宣布，谢瓦尔德纳泽和美国国务卿贝克将于本月22日至23日在美国会晤。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，现在已为苏美对话转入新阶段创造了必要的前提，两国外长会晤的任务是，为新的苏美最高级会晤作好准备。
    苏联外长在谈话中对实际核裁军进程缓慢表示不满。他认为，苏美现在在某些方面距离达成协议比美国上届政府时还远，关于核试验的谈判实际上已经停止了。他说，在上一轮核武器和太空武器谈判中没有就任何一个重要问题达成协议，原因在于美国的立场没有变化。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽表示，在核武器和太空武器谈判中，现在已是作出原则性和大胆决定的时候了，只有这种决定才会导致很快签署协议。
    在谈到苏美双边关系时，谢瓦尔德纳泽说，现在两国有大约40个政府间的协议，涉及所有国民经济领域。但他认为，现在要谈苏美关系的真正飞跃还为时过早，在许多方面还有未加以利用的可能性。
    新华社莫斯科9月11日电　据塔斯社11日报道，苏军总参谋部认为，北约部队正在进行的大规模军事演习违背了北约军事政治领导人关于这一联盟忠实于和平和全面安全事业的声明，不符合他们关于北约军事集团是防御性质的理论。
    报道说，9月初北约国家的领土已经成了练兵场，同时开始了约20场大型各兵种合成的演习以及空军和海军的演习。参加代号为“秋季熔炉”联合军事演习的就有20万官兵、1000辆坦克、近2000架军用飞机和约400艘军舰。
