People's Daily, Beijing, September 28th - Reporter Sun Yi: At today's afternoon press conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing, when asked by a French journalist about the Chinese government's evaluation of the current Sino-French relations, pointed out that we have always highly evaluated General de Gaulle's decisive and wise action 25 years ago to open the doors between the two countries. The Chinese side has always insisted on a policy of promoting Sino-French friendship.

He said, "However, in recent months, the French side has done many unfriendly things, and it is getting worse, causing great damage to the relations between China and France. We hope the French side will stop, strictly follow the norms of international relations, immediately change its current erroneous attitude, and bring Sino-French relations back onto a healthy track."

He reiterated that the Chinese government firmly opposes any country that has diplomatic relations with China allowing criminal offenders wanted by Chinese public security organs to engage in activities aimed at subverting the Chinese government on their territory. We also do not allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs under any pretext or in any way. No one should expect China to swallow the bitter pill of foreign interference in its internal affairs.

    外交部发言人指出
    中国坚持促进中法友好
    希望法方改变错误态度
    本报北京9月28日讯　记者孙毅报道：外交部发言人李肇星在今天下午的新闻发布会上就法国记者提出中国政府对当前的中法关系作何评价时指出，我们一贯高度评价戴高乐将军25年前采取的打开两国关系大门的果断明智的行动。中国方面始终不渝地坚持促进中法友好的政策。
    他说，但是，最近几个月来，法国方面做了许多不友好的事情，而且愈走愈远，使中法两国关系受到了很大的损害。我们希望法方悬崖勒马，严格按照国际关系准则办事，立即改变目前的错误态度，使中法关系回到健康的轨道上来。
    他重申，中国政府坚决反对任何同我国有外交关系的国家允许被中国公安机关通缉的刑事犯罪分子在它们的领土上从事颠覆中国政府的活动，我们也绝不允许任何国家以任何借口、以任何方式干涉中国的内政。任何人都不应该指望中国吞下外国势力干涉自己的内部事务这样的苦果。
