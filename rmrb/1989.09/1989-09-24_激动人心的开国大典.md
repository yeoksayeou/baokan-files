The 5th issue of 1989's *Military History Materials* published an article by Comrade Yang Chengwu titled "The National Day Parade." As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation approaches, we excerpt this article to share with our readers.

On October 1, 1949, this glorious and epoch-making day arrived.

300,000 military and civilian personnel gathered at Tiananmen Square. The crowd, along with flags, ribbons, flowers, and decorations, formed a vibrant sea of celebration.

At 3 PM, the earth shook with cheers. The two great leaders, Mao Zedong and Zhu De, ascended the Tiananmen City Tower first, one after the other, along the ancient brick steps on the west side of the tower.

Lin Boqu announced the start of the meeting. Amid the music of the national anthem, "March of the Volunteers," the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government, along with the members of the Central People's Government, took their seats.

In the music of the national anthem, the people's leader Mao Zedong solemnly declared, "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is established! The Chinese people have stood up!" This voice shook the world.

In the music of the national anthem, Mao Zedong personally pressed the button to raise the first five-star red flag of the People's Republic. As this national flag slowly rose over Tiananmen Square, 54 cannons fired 28 shots in unison, like spring thunder echoing through the heavens and earth.

After the flag-raising, Mao Zedong read the proclamation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. After the proclamation was read, Secretary-General Lin Boqu announced the start of the parade. The parade commander, Zhu De, dressed in full military attire, descended from the Tiananmen City Tower and rode in an open-top car across the Golden Water Bridge. The parade commander-in-chief, Nie Rongzhen, who was waiting on the south side of the bridge, saluted and reported, "The representative units of the army, navy, and air force are all ready for inspection. Please, Commander-in-Chief, inspect them!"

Accompanied by the continuous playing of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "Protecting the Fruits of Victory," Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, accompanied by Commander-in-Chief Nie Rongzhen, inspected the three branches of the military.

Following this, Commander Zhu returned to the Tiananmen City Tower and read the "Order from the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army."

After the inspection, the formation march began.

The first formation was the naval detachment representing the young People's Navy. Over 150 sailors, dressed in new naval uniforms, marched from east to west with the "August 1st" military flag leading the way.

Next came the multi-branch army representatives. The infantry soldiers marched to the beat of "The March of the Eighth Route Army." Accompanied by the music of "The Military March" and "The Tank March," the artillery and armored divisions also rolled past in succession. The armored division included a mechanized infantry regiment and one light and one medium tank regiment each.

When the armored division reached the middle of Chang'an Street, the planes of the People's Air Force flew over Tiananmen Square in formations of three and two, batch after batch. In front of Tiananmen, the sky and the ground merged into one, forming a magnificent three-dimensional military formation. The crowd looked up in awe. Mao Zedong and the other leaders also excitedly looked up at the defenders of the nation's sky.

Before the planes had completely disappeared, the stirring "Cavalry March" announced the arrival of the magnificent cavalry division. After three cavalry regiments, a horse-drawn artillery battalion followed. The entire cavalry division consisted of over 1,900 warhorses, advancing in six columns. The color and equipment of each echelon's horses were uniform, either all red, all white, or all black. The cavalrymen, dressed in green military uniforms, held rifles and sabers, looking formidable.

The inspection and formation march lasted over two hours, with a total of over 16,000 personnel in the parade. These two hours condensed the long history of our military's battles and also foreshadowed the future journey.

After the parade, the joyous crowd began to march through Tiananmen, paying tribute to the new leaders of the Central People's Government and the high-flying five-star red flag.

At night, the city was illuminated with fireworks, and the people of Beijing danced and sang, celebrating the first night of the People's Republic of China.

    激动人心的开国大典
    1989年第5期《军史资料》刊登杨成武同志《开国大典阅兵式》一文，其中回顾了中华人民共和国开国大典的壮观图景。在国庆40周年即将到来之际，谨摘录此文，以飨读者。
    1949年10月1日，这个辉煌的划时代的日子来临了。
    30万军民集聚于天安门广场。人群和旗帜、彩绸、鲜花、灯饰，汇成了喜庆的锦秀海洋。
    下午3时，大地欢声雷动。毛泽东和朱德两位伟人一前一后，沿着城楼西侧的古砖梯道，最先登上了天安门城楼。
    林伯渠宣布开会。在国歌《义勇军进行曲》的乐曲声中，中央人民政府主席、副主席和委员就位。
    在国歌的乐曲声中，人民领袖毛泽东庄严宣布：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立了！中国人民从此站起来了！”这个声音震动了全世界。
    在国歌的乐曲声中，毛泽东亲手按动电钮，升起了人民共和国第一面五星红旗。当这面国旗在天安门广场冉冉升起时，54门礼炮齐放28响，如报春惊雷回荡天地间。
    升旗之后，毛泽东宣读中华人民共和国中央人民政府公告。公告宣读完毕，林伯渠秘书长宣布阅兵开始。阅兵司令员朱德戎装整肃，走下天安门城楼，乘敞篷汽车通过金水桥。迎候在桥南的阅兵总指挥聂荣臻即致军礼并报告：“受阅的陆海空代表部队均已准备完毕，请总司令检阅！”
    在《三大纪律八项注意》、《保卫胜利果实》等乐曲的连续鸣奏中，朱德总司令由聂荣臻总指挥陪同，检阅了三军部队。
    接着，朱总司令重登天安门城楼，宣读
  《中国人民解放军总部命令》。
    检阅完毕便是分列式。
    分列式的第一序列，是代表年轻的人民海军的水兵分队，150多人身着崭新的水兵服，以“八一”军旗为前导，由东向西行进。
    紧接着是多兵种的陆军代表部队。步兵师的战士们踏着《八路军进行曲》的节奏，雄赳赳地走过来了。在《军队进行曲》和《坦克进行曲》的伴奏声中，炮兵师、战车师的队伍也相继隆隆地开过来。战车师包括摩托化步兵团，轻、中型坦克团各1个。
    当战车师行进到长安街中段时，人民空军的飞机分别以三机和双机编队，一批又一批地飞经天安门广场的上空。在天安门前，天上地上，浑然一体，形成雄伟的立体武装阵容，万众仰望。毛泽东等领导人也兴奋地昂首注视祖国领空的保卫者。
      机影还未完全消失，激越的《骑兵进行曲》引出了壮观的骑兵师队伍。3个骑兵团过后，紧接着便是一个挽拽野炮的炮兵营。整个骑兵师共
  1900多匹战马，以6路纵队前进，各
  梯队军马的毛色与装具整齐划一，或全红，或全白，或全黑，骑手们身着草绿色军服，握枪挎刀，威风凛凛。
    检阅式和分列式共用两个多小时，受阅部队的人员总计1.6万多名。这两个多小时，浓缩了我军以往的漫长战斗历程，也预示了未来的征途。
    阅兵式之后，欢腾的群众游行队伍开始通过天安门，向新的中央人民政府领导人致意，向高高飘扬的五星红旗致意。
    入夜，火树银花，载歌载舞，首都北京的军民在尽情地欢度中华人民共和国的第一个夜晚。
