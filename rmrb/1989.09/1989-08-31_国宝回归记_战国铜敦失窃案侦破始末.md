On June 7 of last year, the Warring States bronze ding stolen from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in Zigui, Hubei, after enduring numerous hardships, was returned to Beijing on May 29 this year.

On the first day of June 1988, the security guard at the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall discovered that the cultural relics in the hall had been stolen.

Upon receiving the report, Deputy Director Li Bìhóng of the Zigui County Public Security Bureau quickly led the investigators to the scene. The thieves had stolen nine Warring States period bronze artifacts, including two bronze dings, one bronze ding, one bronze pot, three bronze bells, and three bronze chimes. All of these items were classified as first and second-level national protected cultural relics. Among them, the bronze ding unearthed on October 30, 1974, from the "Qu Family Terrace Warring States No. 1 Tomb" in Zigui County, Hubei Province, is over 2,400 years old and is a rare treasure.

On June 16, 1988, a boat owner reported to the investigators: On the night the cultural relics were stolen, two tall and short outsiders rented my motorboat to Yichang for 500 yuan to transport goods. However, after they disembarked in Yichang, they never returned. The two of them spoke with a Jingsha accent and claimed to be in the chemical business.

On November 16, 1988, the investigators went to Yunyang County for an investigation. The service staff at the inn reported that on the night of March 24, 1988, two people who checked in spoke with a Jingsha accent, one tall and one short, both around 30 years old. After careful analysis, the investigators believed that the criminals might be from Jianli or were hiding in Jianli. They decided to transfer the focus of the investigation to Jianli County.

To find clues left by the criminals, the investigation team worked tirelessly for three days and finally discovered that the traces left at the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in Zigui County were made by Li Jiànxīn.

Li Jiànxīn, male, 30 years old. After serving his sentence in December 1987, he engaged in individual labor. His family's economic situation improved significantly, and he had a strong suspicion of committing a major theft. The decision was made to apprehend Li Jiànxīn and bring him to justice. The interrogator began the interrogation while Li Jiànxīn was still in shock.

"Li Jiànxīn, have you been to the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River this year?" the interrogator asked directly.

Li Jiànxīn answered nervously, "I think I went, but I can't remember clearly."

"Did you go or not?" the interrogator pressed on.

Li Jiànxīn replied, "I went. This year, I made some money from my individual business and went to the Three Gorges for a trip."

"Who did you go with?"

"I went alone."

"Li Jiànxīn, look, what is this?" The interrogator showed two sketch photos.

Li Jiànxīn turned pale as soon as he saw the sketches. He immediately confessed, "It was Lì Jīnfēi who invited me to go."

Lì Jīnfēi, male, 30 years old, fled in 1983 after committing theft. In October 1987, he returned home with a lot of money, and there was a suspicion of theft. He was taken into custody by the Jianli County Public Security Bureau.

"Li Jiànxīn, how did your fingerprints end up at the scene of the theft at the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall?" the interrogator pressed.

Li Jiànxīn reached out to ask the interrogator for a cigarette. Then he confessed: On June 3, 1988, Lì Jīnfēi invited him to take a look at the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall. That same night, Lì Jīnfēi kept watch while Li Jiànxīn climbed over the wall, set up a ladder to the second-floor exhibition hall, broke the window, and entered the room, stealing nine bronze artifacts. After successfully stealing the items, they quickly left the scene. When they reached the road by the Yangtze River, Lì Jīnfēi selected six artifacts and threw the other three damaged ones into a culvert by the roadside. They then paid 500 yuan to rent a motorboat under the pretext of transporting glue, escaping to Yichang City, and later rented a car back to Jianli.

Lì Jīnfēi and the other criminals confessed that they had transported the stolen artifacts to Guangzhou in three batches last year and sold them to art smugglers, earning a total of 597,000 yuan. Among these, the Warring States bronze ding and one chime were sold for 270,000 yuan, and the bronze square pot was sold for 530,000 yuan. Lì Jīnfēi received 500,000 yuan of the proceeds.

To quickly recover the national treasures and the huge sum of money from the stolen artifacts, the Jianli County Public Security Bureau organized police officers to conduct a legal search. In the homes of Lì Jīnfēi, Li Jiànxīn, and those involved, they seized 460,000 yuan in cash, four artifacts, and a large number of stolen items.

The net of heaven is vast but has no gaps. The accomplices Lì Mùpíng, Lǐ Yòupíng, Yáng Tóngxīn, and Wáng Yuánqīng were captured one by one in Jianli. The criminals involved in transporting the artifacts, Chén Jīnmíng and Lǐ Zhōngmíng, were captured with the assistance of the public security authorities in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Railway Station. Lì Jīnpíng and Guān Guófù fled to Shanghai and were apprehended by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

In early November 1988, an overseas friend revealed that in mid-October, he saw a bronze ding at an auction market in New York that looked very much like a Chinese unearthed artifact. When he identified the photo of the bronze ding stolen from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in Zigui, he immediately determined that the bronze ding about to be auctioned in New York was the stolen artifact from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in China.

The bronze ding was about to be auctioned in the United States, and relevant Chinese authorities paid great attention to this matter.

According to the United Nations "Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property," Sotheby's Company should return this artifact to China. On November 26, 1988, the Chinese National Central Bureau of Interpol requested that the U.S. side assist the Chinese police in recovering the Warring States bronze ding. On the morning of November 28, relevant high-level officials from the Ministry of Public Security met with a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in China, requesting that the U.S. side assist in temporarily suspending the auction of this artifact.

The next day, Sotheby's Auction House decided to stop the auction of the Chinese bronze ding and proposed to the Chinese mission in the U.S.: After the Chinese side provides materials proving that the bronze ding belongs to China, they will, together with their client, donate the ancient bronze ding to China in the form of a donation. At this critical moment, the Chinese police had already cracked the case on December 8, 1988, providing conclusive evidence for the recovery of the bronze ding. Therefore, Sotheby's Company returned the Warring States bronze ding to the Chinese Embassy in the U.S.

    国宝回归记
    ——战国铜敦失窃案侦破始末
    去年6月7日，湖北秭归屈原纪念馆被盗的战国铜敦，历经劫难的铜敦已于今年5月29日从美国运回北京。
    1988年6月初的一天，屈原纪念馆值班员发现馆内文物遭窃。
    秭归县公安局接到报案后，李必红副局长迅速带领侦查员赶赴现场。窃贼盗走战国时期青铜器9件，其中铜敦2件、铜鼎1件、铜壶3件、编钟3件。均系国家一、二级保护文物，其中1974年10月30日在湖北省秭归县“屈家坪战国一号墓”出土的铜敦距今已有2400多年，乃稀世之宝。
    1988年6月16日，一位船老板向侦查员反映：在文物被盗的当晚，有一高一矮的两个外地人，出500元租我的机动船到宜昌运货，可他们在宜昌上岸后，一去不返。他们2人操荆沙口音，自称是做化工生意的。
    1988年11月16日，侦查员到云阳县调查。招待所服务员反映，1988年3月24日晚投宿的两个人操荆沙口音，一高一矮，年龄在30岁左右。经周密分析，侦查员认为，案犯有可能是监利人或者隐藏在监利，决定将侦查力量的重点移师监利县。
    为了寻找案犯的蛛丝马迹，侦破组经过3天艰苦奋战，终于发现秭归县屈原纪念馆留下的痕迹是案犯李建新所留。
    李建新，男，30岁。1987年12月刑满释放后，从事个体劳动，家庭经济暴富，有重大盗窃嫌疑，决定将李建新抓获归案。预审员趁李建新惊魂未定，开始审讯。
    “李建新，你今年到过长江三峡吗？”预审员单刀直入。
    李建新慌慌张张回答：“好像去过，但记不清了”。
    “究竟去过没有？”预审员穷追不舍。
    李建新答道：“去过。今年我搞个体户赚了几个钱，到三峡玩了一趟。”
    “你和谁一道去的？”
    “就我一人去的。”
      “李建新，你看，这是什么？”预审员拿出两张摹拟照片。
    李建新一见画像，顿时面如土色。当即交待：“是栗金飞约我去的”。
    栗金飞，男，30岁，1983年因盗窃潜逃。1987年10月回家，腰缠万贯，有盗窃犯罪嫌疑。被监利县公安局收审。
    “李建新，你的指纹怎么留在屈原纪念馆的盗窃现场的？”预审员紧逼地问。
    李建新伸手向预审员要烟抽。接着他交待：1988年6月3日，栗金飞约他到屈原馆看看，次日深夜，由栗金飞放哨，李建新翻墙入内，搭梯攀上二楼展厅，撬窗入室，盗窃9件青铜器。得手后，他们迅速逃离现场。来到长江边公路上，栗金飞挑选了6件文物，将另外3件有破损的抛进公路旁一涵洞内，然后花500元，以拖万能胶为名，租一机动船逃到宜昌市，后又租车回到监利。
    栗金飞等案犯交待：他们于去年9月将所盗文物分3次运往广州卖给文物走私分子，共获赃款59.7万元。其中战国铜敦和1件编钟共卖得2.7万元，铜方壶卖得53万元。栗金飞分赃50万元。
    为了迅速追回国宝和盗卖文物的巨款，监利县公安局组织干警依法进行搜查。在栗金飞、李建新和有牵连人的家共搜出赃款46万元，文物4件和大批赃物。
    天网恢恢，疏而不漏。同案犯栗木平、李又平、杨同新、王元清在监利先后落网。盗运文物分子陈金明、李忠明在广东省和广州车站公安机关的协助下被抓获，栗金平、关国富逃到上海，被上海市公安局缉拿归案。
    1988年11月上旬，一位海外朋友透露，10月中旬，他在纽约拍卖市场见到一件铜敦，很像中国的出土文物。当他辨认秭归屈原馆被盗铜敦的照片时，当即断定：纽约市场上即将拍卖的那件铜敦，就是中国秭归屈原馆的失窃文物。
    铜敦在美国即将拍卖，我国有关方面十分重视。
    根据联合国《关于禁止和防止非法进出口文化财产和非法转让其所有权的方法的公约》规定，索斯比公司应当将此文物归还中国。1988年11月26日，国际刑警组织中国国家中心局，要求美方协助中国警方追回战国铜敦。11月28日上午，公安部的有关高级官员约见美国驻华使馆的一位外交官，请求美方协助暂时中止这件文物的拍卖活动。
    第二天，索斯比拍卖行决定停止拍卖中国的铜敦，并向中国驻美机构提出：在中国方面提出能够证明该铜敦所有权属于中国的材料后，将与其委托人一起以捐献的形式把古铜敦归还中国。就在这个节骨眼上，中国警方已于1988年12月8日破获此案，为索回铜敦提供了确凿的证据。为此，索斯比公司将战国铜敦“完璧归赵”，归还给我国驻美使馆。
