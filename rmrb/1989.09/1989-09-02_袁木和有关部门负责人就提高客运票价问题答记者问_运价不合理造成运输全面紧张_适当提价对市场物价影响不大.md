Clarification on the Adjustment of Passenger Transport Prices

The State Council spokesperson, Yuan Mu, held a press conference today to announce the increase in passenger transport prices for railways, waterways, and civil aviation, and to explain the reasons behind the price adjustment. Joining Yuan Mu in answering reporters' questions were Chen Zhiping, Director of the State Price Bureau, Luo Yun Guang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways, Lin Zuyi, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications, and Guan De, Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Yuan Mu first announced that, with the approval of the State Council, passenger transport prices for railways, waterways, and civil aviation will be raised nationwide starting from September 5th. He then addressed the questions raised by reporters.

When asked why the passenger transport prices for railways, waterways, and civil aviation need to be adjusted, the spokesperson said that currently, China's transportation sector is facing severe challenges, with many transport facilities aging and in disrepair. Both domestic and foreign passengers have strongly expressed their difficulties in traveling. One of the main reasons for this situation is the irrational pricing of transport services.

Taking railway transportation as an example, the current passenger transport price of 0.02 yuan per person-kilometer has remained unchanged since 1955, except for some adjustments made to short-distance passenger transport prices in 1985. Over the past 30-plus years, the prices of coal, diesel, electricity, steel, and timber, which are essential for railway operations, have significantly increased, leading to a substantial rise in railway transport costs. Currently, railway passenger transport mainly relies on overloading to maintain operations. If overloading is excluded, the actual cost has tripled compared to the 1950s, resulting in operational losses.

For civil aviation, the domestic passenger ticket prices were set in the early 1950s at 0.20 yuan per person-kilometer along railway lines and 0.31 yuan per person-kilometer for routes not along railways, which reflected the aviation transport costs at that time and were relatively close to international aviation ticket prices. After several adjustments, the current average price is only 0.11 yuan per person-kilometer, much lower than in the 1950s. Domestic routes have been in a state of loss for a long time; the longer the flight distance, the greater the loss. Currently, most of China's civil aviation aircraft are imported, financed through loans, and some are even leased. In addition to repaying loans and paying rent, they are also affected by exchange rate fluctuations. Coupled with the rise in fuel prices, the operating costs of civil aviation aircraft have approached international levels, but ticket prices are significantly lower than international standards.

Regarding waterway passenger transport, the ticket prices for coastal and inland waterways operated by central government enterprises have been adjusted several times since the founding of the People's Republic, but due to improvements in cabin grades and equipment conditions, the actual ticket price level is lower than it was at the beginning of the liberation. Currently, central government-operated coastal and inland passenger transport enterprises are in a state of overall loss, with a deficit of over 50 million yuan in 1988.

The transportation industry lacks the ability for self-accumulation and self-development, and even struggles to maintain simple reproduction. Many railway lines and equipment are old and outdated; some inland vessels have reached the end of their service life and are operating beyond their designated years; civil aviation ground service facilities are rudimentary, and basic facilities such as communication, navigation, and meteorology are urgently in need of updates. The deterioration of equipment has already threatened transportation safety.

On the other hand, railways, waterways, and airlines are all operating at or beyond their capacity. Taking railways as an example, passenger traffic was 300 million in 1955 and reached 1.2 billion in 1988. Railway passenger trains are generally overloaded by 30%, with some trains overloaded by nearly 100%. Nationwide, approximately 700,000 passengers travel by standing in trains every day. Low passenger transport prices have objectively stimulated demand, exacerbating the difficulty of travel and encouraging illegal activities such as scalping train and boat tickets. Overall, passenger transport prices have reached a point where they must be raised.

One of the key tasks in the current economic work is to strictly control the rise in prices. Will the increase in passenger transport prices for railways, waterways, and civil aviation affect market price stability? In response to this question from reporters, the spokesperson said that raising passenger transport prices will have some impact on market prices, but the impact will not be significant. This is because the additional expenses for state organs and public institutions are administrative and operational expenditures, which do not directly affect the formation of commodity prices. The additional expenses for business travel personnel, although included in production costs, account for a very small proportion of the total costs, and enterprises can absorb these costs internally. Some people are concerned that with the increase in passenger transport prices, some enterprises may take advantage of the situation to raise prices. The State Council has made clear regulations on this matter: "To maintain market price stability, it is strictly forbidden for any department, region, or enterprise to take advantage of the increase in passenger transport prices to raise prices, add new charges, or increase charging standards. Violators will be severely punished, and the responsible parties will be held accountable."

The spokesperson pointed out that since this year, local governments and relevant departments have seriously implemented the State Council's series of measures to control prices, and initial results have been seen. In recent months, the prices of some durable consumer goods have even fallen. These situations indicate that people's minds are stable, and the market is further stabilizing. In the future, the state will continue to strictly control prices and maintain market price stability from all aspects.

    袁木和有关部门负责人就提高客运票价问题答记者问
    运价不合理造成运输全面紧张
    适当提价对市场物价影响不大
    本报北京9月2日讯　记者梅洪如报道：国务院发言人袁木今天主持新闻发布会，宣布铁路、水路、民航提高客运票价，并说明提价原因。与袁木一道作为新闻发布人回答记者提问的还有国家物价局局长成致平、铁道部副部长罗云光、交通部副部长林祖乙、中国民航局副局长管德。
    袁木首先宣布，经国务院批准，全国从9月5日起提高铁路、水路、民航客运票价。随后解答了记者们提出的有关问题。
    当记者问到铁路、水路、民航客运票价为什么要作上述调整时，新闻发布人说，目前我国交通运输全面紧张，许多运输设备年久失修，国内外旅客强烈反映“行路难”。造成这种状况的重要原因之一是运价不合理。
    拿铁路运输来说，现行的人公里0.02元的客运票价，还是1955年制定的。30多年来，除1985年对短途客运票价作过一些调整外，一直没有变动。但随着煤、柴油、电、钢材、木材等生产资料价格上涨，铁路运输成本大幅度上升。当前铁路客运主要靠超员收入维持经营。如减去超员，实际成本比50年代上升了3倍，运营是亏损的。
    民航国内旅客票价，50年代初定的是，沿铁路线人公里0.20元，不沿铁路线人公里0.31元，基本上体现了当时的航空运输成本，也与当时的国际航空票价水平较接近。后来几经变动，到现在平均人公里仅为0.11元，比50年代低得多。国内航线长期处于亏损状态；飞行里程越多，亏损越大。目前我国民航飞机绝大多数是进口的，资金靠贷款，部分飞机还是租赁的，不仅要还本付息，支付租金，还要受外汇汇率变化的影响。加上燃料价格上涨，民航飞机的运输成本已接近国际水平，但票价却大大低于国外水平。
    再看水路客运，我国中央直属企业的沿海、内河运输客票价，建国以来曾作过几次调整，但由于舱位等级和设备条件逐步改善，实际票价水平低于解放初期。目前中央直属的沿海、内河客运企业处于全面亏损状态，1988年亏损额达5000多万元。
    交通运输业不仅缺乏自我积累、自我发展能力，甚至连简单再生产也难以维持。许多铁路线路和设备陈旧老化；内河船舶有些已达报废年限，超期服役；民航地面服务设施简陋，通讯、导航、气象等基础设施亟待更新，等等。设备恶化状况已危及运输安全。
    另一方面，铁路、水路、航空等承受的客运量，普遍处于超负荷状态。以铁路为例，1955年客运量为3亿人次，1988年已达12亿人次。铁路旅客列车一般超员30％，有的车次竟超员
  1倍左右。全国每天约有70万旅客不是“坐”车，而是“站”火车旅行。客运价格过低，客观上起了刺激客运需求的作用，既加剧了“行路难”，也助长了不法分子倒卖车、船票等歪风。总观各方面情况，客运票价已到非提不可的时候了。
    当前经济工作中的一个重要任务是严格控制物价上涨，铁路、水路、民航客运提价，会不会影响市场物价稳定？回答记者提出的这个问题时，新闻发布人说，提高客运票价，会对市场物价有所影响，但影响不会大。这是因为，国家机关和事业单位所增加的费用，支出属于行政事业开支，对商品价格的形成没有直接关系。企业出差人员所增加的费用，虽然进入产品成本，但这部分费用在成本中所占比重很小，企业能够自行消化。有些群众担心，随着客运票价提高，一部分企业会一哄而起，乘机涨价。对这一点，国务院已做了明确规定：“为了保持市场物价稳定，严禁各部门、各地区、各企业乘提高客运票价之机，‘搭车’涨价，或增加收费项目，提高收费标准。违者要从严查处，并追究有关负责人的责任”。
    新闻发布人指出，应当看到，今年以来，各地政府和有关部门认真执行国务院一系列控制物价措施，已经初见成效。近几个月部分耐用消费品价格还有所回落。这些情况说明人心安定，市场在进一步稳定。今后国家将继续从严控制物价，从各方面保持市场物价的基本稳定。
