Beijing held a symposium to commemorate the 90th birthday of Li Kenong, a revolutionary of the proletariat and an outstanding leader of the Party and the military in intelligence and security work.

On September 12, the General Staff Department and the Ministry of State Security held the symposium in Beijing.

President Yang Shangkun attended the symposium. Wu Xiuquan, Xu Huizhi, Jia Chunwang, and others spoke at the meeting. Comrade Deng Yingchao sent a representative to attend the meeting.

Comrade Li Kenong joined the Party in 1926 and long served as a leader in the Party and the military's intelligence and security work. After liberation, he held positions such as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In the revolutionary struggle, he was loyal and fearless, brave and wise; he worked diligently and seriously on his duties. On the front line of the Party and the state's covert struggle against the enemy, he was content to be an unnamed hero. Comrade Li Kenong passed away in February 1962 due to illness.
