In recent years, Jilin Province has paid special attention to legal education for college students while promoting the popularization of legal knowledge, achieving certain results. So far, all 42 colleges and universities in the province have opened courses on the basics of law. Over 50,000 college students have studied the "Ten Laws and One Regulation," with a popularization rate of over 90%. College students' legal awareness has generally been enhanced. Starting from 1988, Jilin Province has, in accordance with the requirements of the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Justice, included legal education as a compulsory course for college students, making college legal education more standardized.

During the turmoil in Beijing this year, the province, in response to the unstable factors present in some colleges and universities at the time, organized the first legal knowledge competition for college students in the province, in line with the relevant requirements of the provincial party committee. This not only enriched their legal knowledge but also provided them with vivid and profound legal education.

    吉林加强大学生法制教育
    几年来，吉林省在开展普及法律常识的工作中，注意加强对大专院校学生的法制教育，收到了一定的效果。到目前为止，全省四十二所大专院校全部开设了法律基础课，有50000多名大学生学习了“十法一例”，普及率达到90％以上，大学生的法制观念普遍增强。从1988年开始，吉林省又按国家教委、司法部的要求，把法制课作为大学生的必修课纳入课堂教学，使高校法制教育走向正规化。
    在今年北京发生学潮、动乱到暴乱期间，全省针对当时一些院校存在不安定因素的情况，按照省委有关要求，举办了全省首届大学生法律知识竞赛活动，不但使他们丰富了法律知识，而且受到了生动、深刻的法制教育。　司　俭
