    Unexpectedly Quick Recovery
    —An Interview with Nan Jiang, Director of the Fujian Provincial Tourism Bureau
    By Zhang Mingqing, People's Daily Reporter

    An interview with Nan Jiang, Director of the Fujian Provincial Tourism Bureau, was scheduled for 8:30 AM. However, by that time, he had not yet arrived. Just as I was growing anxious, he hurriedly climbed the stairs, panting and apologizing, "Sorry, sorry, I was just sending off two groups of Taiwanese tourists visiting relatives, and I'm a bit late."

    Since the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the tourism industry has been severely impacted. Two months ago, when I met Nan Jiang, some overseas tourists had canceled their bookings, and he was quite worried.

    "I didn't expect the tourism industry to recover so quickly!" Nan Jiang explained, "Although last month saw the cancellation of over 500 tour groups, involving more than 20,000 people, from January to July, the province's tourism earnings reached 166 million foreign exchange RMB, an 8% increase over the same period last year. Currently, the number of charter flights between Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Hong Kong has exceeded last year's figures, and they are almost fully booked."

    I was puzzled. If so many tour groups had canceled, how could the number of tourists rebound so quickly?

    Nan Jiang explained that the main reason was the rapid increase in the number of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwanese compatriots, as well as Southeast Asian Chinese and European tourists. Since 1987, when the Taiwan authorities eased restrictions on citizens visiting the mainland to visit relatives, the Fujian tourism department has implemented a series of supporting measures to provide services for Taiwanese compatriots returning to visit relatives. Although the turmoil in Beijing and the counter-revolutionary riot affected Fujian's tourism industry, due to Fujian's relatively stable situation, the tourism department's efforts to develop the tourism market in Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities, as well as the Taiwan authorities' opening of public sector employees to visit relatives on the mainland and the direct dialing and direct communication across the Taiwan Strait, since July, Fujian has organized Taiwanese compatriot tour groups to visit relatives every day. The occupancy rate of foreign-related hotels in the province has reached about 70%.

    Nan Jiang said that the ninth day of the ninth lunar month is the anniversary of the Mazu Temple. More than 3,000 Taiwanese compatriots are expected to visit the Mazu Temple in Putian City's Meizhou Island for pilgrimage. The pilgrimage fever at the Mazu Temple will certainly bring about a wave of visits to relatives.

### 没想到恢复得这么快——访福建省旅游局长南江

    没想到恢复得这么快
    ——访福建省旅游局长南江
    本报记者　张铭清
    约好8点半采访福建省旅游局长南江，可时间到了还不见他人影。正焦急中，只见他气喘吁吁地爬上楼梯，边走边拱拱双手：“对不起，对不起，刚刚去送两个台胞探亲旅游团，来迟了一步。”
    自从北京发生了反革命暴乱后，旅游业首当其冲地受到影响。两个多月前，我见到南江，正遇到一些海外旅游者退团，南江真有点着急。
    “没想到旅游业恢复得这么快！”南江介绍说：“尽管上个月旅游团组退团500多个，2万多人，但1至7月份，全省旅游创汇达1.66亿元外汇人民币，比去年同期增长8％。目前，福州、厦门与香港间旅游包机已超过去年的航班数，而且基本客满。”
    我有点纳闷，既然退了那么多旅游团组，何以游客数回升那么快呢？
    南江解释说，主要是回乡探亲观光的港澳台胞和东南亚华侨及欧洲的游客增加得快。自从1987年台湾当局放宽民众赴大陆探亲旅游的限制后，福建省旅游部门采取了一系列配套措施为台胞回乡探亲旅游提供服务。北京的动乱和反革命暴乱虽然使福建的旅游业受到影响，但由于福建的局势一直比较稳定，旅游部门又致力于开拓台湾和海外华人的旅游市场，加之台湾当局开放公教人员回大陆探亲旅游、海峡两岸直拨电话与直接通信开通，所以进入7月份以来，每天都有福建组织的台胞探亲旅游团来闽，全省涉外宾馆床位利用率已达70％左右。
    南江说，农历九月初九是妈祖忌日，来莆田市湄洲岛妈祖庙朝圣的台胞将超过3000人，妈祖庙的朝圣热必然带来一个探亲旅游热。
