Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with Professor Lee Tsung-Dao and his wife, Qin Huiqing, of Columbia University in the United States, this morning in the Great Hall of the People. Deng reiterated that the various policies implemented during the ten years of reform and opening up will not change. China's modernization drive and open policy will be even better.

He said that the recent turmoil has taught us a lesson. For many years, some of our comrades have been busy with specific tasks, paying less attention to ideological and political trends, and have been insufficiently vigilant against serious corruption. The measures taken to rectify this have not been effective. After this turmoil, everyone's minds have become clearer.

Deng Xiaoping said that China cannot do without socialism, and cannot do without adhering to socialism. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no socialism, and no present-day China.

He said that China's current situation is stable. After the turmoil, the new leadership will adhere to the reform and opening-up policies of the past ten years, maintain a stable and united situation, and adhere to one central task and two basic points. Of course, there will be twists and turns and shortcomings. But we believe that those who adhere to this policy will ultimately win.

Deng Xiaoping said that one thing is certain: China must develop, production forces must develop, and there must be an appropriate rate of development. In short, after the turmoil, we must be good at summing up experiences, opposing corruption, and promoting clean politics. In this way, China's progress will be more steady, more solid, and faster.

At the beginning of the meeting, Lee Tsung-Dao said, "Seeing you in such good health makes me very happy." Deng Xiaoping, pointing to his dark skin on his hand, said, "I have gone swimming. I don't like indoor swimming pools; I like swimming in nature."

After a 70-minute conversation, Deng Xiaoping hosted a luncheon for Lee Tsung-Dao and his wife.

Academician Zhou Guangzhao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences participated in the meeting and the banquet.

　　邓小平会见李政道教授时重申
　　改革开放各项政策不会变
　　中国一定要发展要有适当发展速度
　　总结经验反对腐败现象搞廉洁政治
    新华社北京9月16日电　（记者虞家复）邓小平主席今天上午在人民大会堂会见美国哥伦比亚大学教授李政道夫妇时重申，中国在十年改革开放中制定的各项政策是不会改变的。中国的四化建设和开放政策将会搞得更好。
    他说，不久前的动乱给我们上了一堂大课。多年来，我们的一些同志埋头于搞具体事务，不那么关心思想动态、政治动态，对那么严重的腐败现象警惕不足，纠正的措施也不得力。这次动乱后，大家的头脑清醒了。
    邓小平说，中国不搞社会主义不行，不坚持社会主义不行。没有共产党的领导，就没有社会主义，就没有现在的中国。
    他说，中国目前的局势是稳定的。经过动乱以后，新的领导班子将坚持过去十年的改革开放政策，保持安定团结的局面，坚持一个中心、两个基本点。当然，其中不会没有曲折、没有缺点。但我们相信，坚持这个方针政策的人，最终会取得胜利。
    邓小平说，有一点是肯定的，那就是中国一定要发展，生产力要发展，要有适当的发展速度。总之，在动乱后，我们要善于总结经验，反对腐败现象，搞廉洁政治，这样，中国的前进步伐将更稳妥、更扎实、更快。
    会见开始时，李政道说，看到你身体这样好，我很高兴。邓小平指着手上黝黑的皮肤说，我下海了，游过泳。我不喜欢室内游泳池，喜欢在大自然里游泳。
    交谈70分钟后，邓小平设午宴招待李政道和夫人秦惠?。
