Over the past two years, "anxiety" has become a hot topic. In early 1988, there was a discussion in the World Economic Herald about the "citizenship" issue. In between, there was the "River Elegy" that exaggerated the idea of a blue civilization replacing the yellow civilization. At the end of the year, Yan Jiaqi and Wang Luxiang published "A Dialogue on the Situation," claiming that the "rectification and adjustment" would plunge China into "long-term stagnation." This round of turmoil and unrest was also filled with various anxieties. Those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization call "anxiety" one of the most frequently used words in the reform vocabulary of 1988. The voices of anxiety have been unceasing, creating quite a stir. However, someone has already pointed out that "what has not been doubted is precisely the doubt itself." Now that this turmoil has subsided, the vast majority of young students are reflecting. Many people painfully ask, "We thought we had sincere intentions to worry about the country and the people, so why did we get involved in this turmoil that almost threatened the future and destiny of the Party and the state? Those who claim to be 'calling for a national sense of anxiety,' why is their 'anxiety' so incompatible with that of the people and the Party Central Committee? What kind of anxiety consciousness does the Party and the people expect from young intellectuals? This cannot but prompt people to reflect deeply.

Anxiety consciousness, in the sense of worrying about the country and the people, is not a bad thing and is not new. The history of modern China is a history of advanced Chinese people worrying about the country and the people and struggling to save the country and the people. Chinese Communists, with a strong desire to worry about the country and the people, found Marxism and socialism, and after 28 years of arduous struggle, established the great People's Republic of China. After the founding of New China, our Party has also been vigilant, advocating anxiety consciousness. On the eve of the founding of the nation, Comrade Mao Zedong warned the entire Party to be vigilant against arrogance, the tendency to stagnate and not seek progress, and the tendency to seek pleasure and not want to live a hard life again. After the founding of the nation, he repeatedly emphasized the need to overcome arrogance and self-satisfaction, and the tendency to be self-satisfied and closed-minded. At the same time, the Party Central Committee led the entire Party and the people of the whole country to make arduous explorations for the smooth construction of the socialist cause in China. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Chinese Communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their representative, through a comparison of both positive and negative aspects, have decided to lead the Chinese people to get rid of poverty and catch up with the advanced level of the world. Their anxiety consciousness has a higher perspective and historical sense and has entered the conscious stage, beginning the process of reform and opening up. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "Reform is the self-improvement of socialism." It seeks to negate everything that is unrealistic, outdated, and attached to socialism, not socialism itself, and it seeks to fully and consistently demonstrate the superiority of socialism. The achievements recognized by the world since the reform and opening up have proven that this conscious anxiety consciousness is the crystallization and sublimation of the anxiety consciousness of the Chinese nation to strengthen the country and enrich the people over the past hundred years, representing the revival and hope of the Chinese nation, becoming the main melody of the times, and winning the sincere support of the people of the whole country.

However, we have indeed seen that the "anxiety" of those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization is fundamentally different from that of our Party. They put on a very "anxious" face, their emotions are so fervent, and their words are so fierce, as if except for them, in such a large China, there is no one else who worries about the country and the people. However, their anxiety, with its negative criticism, is directed at the entire socialist system, pursuing a capitalist political and economic system.

Obviously, due to the fundamental differences in stance and starting point, there are two completely opposite views on anxiety. Then, what is the difference between the two views on anxiety, and what kind of anxiety consciousness should young intellectuals have? Here is a preliminary analysis.

First, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is based on a correct understanding of the national conditions, while that view of anxiety that takes the West as a reference system is subjective idealism. As a kind of social consciousness, the emotional "dressing" of anxiety consciousness cannot change its essence as a reflection of social existence. It must adapt to social existence. "The greatest trouble in the world is to not know why things are the way they are." Anxiety first of all is to figure out what the trouble is. Our Party advocates building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is to advocate seeking truth from facts and starting from the national conditions of China. This does not exclude the need to broaden one's horizons in understanding the crux of China's problems and to take the development of the world as an important reference system. However, all these comparisons are for the purpose of deepening the understanding of China's problems and grasping our own special historical, natural, and social conditions to choose a development path suitable for ourselves. "The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strengthening the country," and "only socialism can save China." These words seem simple, but they are scientific conclusions drawn by the Chinese people after countless explorations, conforming to historical laws. They contain and condense the main content of a nation's anxiety over nearly a hundred years. The so-called "social elites" anxiety is based on the so-called "Western civilization." Since they claim that "modernization is Westernization" and "the United States is the center of world civilization," and attack patriotism as "a narrow sentiment," the "anxiety" they claim is actually to use Western ideas, values, and political and economic systems to review and criticize everything in China. How can they prescribe a remedy that suits China's reality? Many young students care about the future of the motherland, which is good, but they have not yet entered society and lack a practical understanding of the most basic requirements of the 1.1 billion people in China and the most urgent real crisis in our country. Their anxiety has a bit of the flavor of "youth unaware of sorrow" and "forcing new words to express sorrow." We need to guide young people to go deep into society and reality, understand the national conditions of China. Regarding why China cannot adopt the three powers of separation and multiparty system of the West? How to build our high-level socialist democracy? Why it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and not to copy the consumption model of the West? Why we must adhere to the public ownership as the mainstay and not to privatize the economy? Why it is said that stability is the greatest interest of China, and we must resolutely oppose turmoil? All these need to help them combine with the national conditions of China to think deeply, so that they can truly understand that only by firmly standing on this land of China, the anxiety of young intellectuals can hit the nail on the head and truly play a role in promoting the good and eliminating the bad.

Second, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is unified with national pride and self-confidence, and we do not advocate spreading nihilism and failure emotions. We say that anxiety can revive the country, meaning that an urgent sense of crisis can make people vigilant and strive to enhance the cohesion of the nation. At the same time, we must also point out that anxiety cannot be separated from national self-confidence. Anxiety without self-confidence can only lead to negativity and decline, and there is no question of any cohesion. Anxiety and national self-confidence are an indispensable unity of national rationality, not mutually exclusive. As Mr. Lu Xun said: "Although the Han and Tang dynasties also had border troubles, their spirit was indeed great, and the people had the self-confidence not to be slaves of other races, or they did not even think about it. Whenever they adopted foreign things, they would treat them as captives and use them freely, without any hesitation." (_Tomb Â· Reflection on Looking in the Mirror_) But what kind of anxiety consciousness does "River Elegy" arouse? They not only use "anxiety" to deny the five-thousand-year civilization, declare the "setting of the Asian sun," and believe that the unyielding struggle of the Chinese nation in the past hundred years has provided people with "only darkness, humiliation, and setbacks," but also the socialist revolution and construction since the founding of the nation have left them with "only sorrow and bitterness." They attack patriotism as "causing a near-pathological sense of self-worth and a delusional national megalomania," and deliberately spread a sense of failure, seriously eroding our national self-confidence and cohesion. If the process of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people's revolution is to make the Chinese people, who were once called "a heap of loose sand" and "the sick man of East Asia," gain the confidence to control their own destiny, and thus be able to resist and overcome internal and external troubles and stand tall in the world, then today, the "elites" are trying to destroy the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation's cohesion, which constitutes a greater crisis behind all specific difficulties. Isn't this enough to make us anxious and reflect?

Third, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is the unity of criticism and construction. Doubting everything and negating everything will only lead to hostility and destructive emotions towards reality. Anxiety consciousness is not purely expressed as a negative value orientation because it simultaneously contains constructive thinking beyond itself. Negation contains affirmation, reflecting on mistakes and shortcomings, and at the same time affirming the correct and promoting the good, which is the dialectical attitude that rational thinking should have. For the twists and turns and mistakes in the construction of our country since its founding, we should reflect deeply, reflect to transcend and move forward; for various social ills at present, of course, we should expose and criticize, expose and criticize to uphold justice and improve the social mechanism. The so-called "maintaining a thorough critical attitude towards reality," "hating this kind of thing for 30 years," and even "hating to kick China twice" are all expressions of hatred that have no trace of rational anxiety dialectical attitude! Such "anxiety" will only lead to the destruction of society rather than construction and creation, which has been fully proven in this turmoil and riot. Take the phenomenon of corruption that the people and young students across the country are extremely concerned about. The anxiety of young students and the anxiety of the Party and the people should be completely consistent. "The issue of party style is a matter of life and death for the Party." This is a profound anxiety! If, in the estimation of the situation of corruption, the deep social causes of the emergence of corruption, and the corresponding institutional construction and measures, a consensus is formed among the whole Party and the whole people, it will certainly form a powerful supervisory force, greatly promoting the improvement of party style and social atmosphere. However, if, like some people, shouting the slogan of "overthrowing the corrupt government," directing the spearhead at the entire Party and all levels of government, and adopting the "overthrow" form of the Cultural Revolution, it will not only fail to achieve constructive results but will also cause social turmoil, making good intentions go to the opposite of their wishes. This is indeed alarming.

Fourth, we advocate that intellectuals share the anxiety of the people of the whole country, while a few conspirators want to use young intellectuals as tools for political struggle. Intellectuals, as part of the working class, should share the anxiety of the people of the whole country and truly reflect the interests of the masses. In fact, since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the status of intellectuals has been improved, and the Party and the government pay great attention to listening to their opinions and encouraging them to make positive explorations on the development path of socialism. However, there are indeed a few conspirators who cannot represent the mainstream of intellectuals and want to be independent of the people, the working class, the Party, and the government. Fang Lizhi has long proposed that "intellectuals should become an independent leading force," and in this student movement, he openly proposed that "the intellectual circle should form a group to exert pressure on the authorities," and to form a "pressure group." Such an anxiety consciousness is a rebellious consciousness that is opposed to the consciousness of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist state. In order to tie more intellectuals to their chariot, they slander those intellectuals who do not follow them to make trouble and firmly guard their work and study posts as having "no sense of mission and social responsibility," and say that "devoting oneself to one's profession only belongs to a lower level of value orientation," and only going out to make trouble can show a high-level value orientation of "ultimate concern." However, the process from this student movement to turmoil and riot has precisely shown that those intellectuals who firmly guard their work posts and resolutely resist their tricks truly show a high sense of mission and social responsibility; in the face of the erroneous tide, many people who are not moved are precisely out of concern for the fate of the Party and the state, which can be said to be a kind of political participation that shows a high degree of political awareness and anxiety. Their anxiety is in sync with the pulse of the Party and the people, truly reflecting the mainstream of contemporary intellectuals' anxiety consciousness. Reflecting on the lessons of this turmoil, many young students feel deeply harmed by bourgeois liberalization, falling into the danger of placing themselves in a position incompatible with the Party and the people, with the workers and peasants. We should encourage them to engage in social practice, in the process of learning from the people, to correct their position in social life, and truly share the anxiety with the Party and the people.

Fifth, as a kind of rational evaluation and criticism, we emphasize that anxiety consciousness must be guided by Marxism, while the anxiety consciousness of those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization is based on the bourgeois worldview. Although some people have avoided talking about worldviews in recent years, people's anxiety consciousness is inevitably influenced by worldviews. We might as well flip through the pages of anxiety in Chinese modern and contemporary thought history. Among intellectuals, Kang Youwei and Sun Yat-sen, Li Dazhao and Hu Shi, Lu Xun and Liang Shiqiu, their anxieties are so different! And only the advanced intellectuals of China who have mastered the theoretical weapons of Marxism have made the anxiety consciousness of the Chinese nation to save the country and strengthen the country enter the conscious stage. An important lesson from the occurrence and development of this student movement into turmoil is that in recent years we have abandoned the ideological battlefield and allowed bourgeois liberalization to spread. For many young intellectuals, the ten years of turmoil left them with an irreparable spiritual trauma and cultural vacuum. When they woke up from the nightmare and entered the process of painful reflection and criticism of society, a large number of Western political and cultural theories surged in, making them unable to distinguish between good and bad and difficult to resist. And their anxiety emotions, which are highly situational, intense, and short-lived, are easily bewitched or used, and there are countless examples of young students' sensory emotional judgments being used and misled by a few people in the process of turmoil. This once again raises the necessity of systematic Marxist worldview education.

After this fierce struggle, our nation's anxiety has been elevated to a new level. We should calmly consider the past and also consider the future. How will the Chinese nation revive its national spirit, strive for self-improvement, unite and stand up? How can we make our socialist system more vibrant? We need the whole nation to think calmly at a higher level and a more conscious state. Facing the challenges of the turn of the century, we still have to say, anxiety can bring enlightenment. The problem is not in anxiety, but in how to be anxious. Let us endure hardships and strive unremittingly.
