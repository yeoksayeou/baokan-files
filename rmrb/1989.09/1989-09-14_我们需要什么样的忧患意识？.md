Over the past two years, "anxiety" has become a hot topic. In early 1988, there was a discussion in the World Economic Herald about the "citizenship" issue. In between, there was the "River Elegy" that exaggerated the idea of a blue civilization replacing the yellow civilization. At the end of the year, Yan Jiaqi and Wang Luxiang published "A Dialogue on the Situation," claiming that the "rectification and adjustment" would plunge China into "long-term stagnation." This round of turmoil and unrest was also filled with various anxieties. Those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization call "anxiety" one of the most frequently used words in the reform vocabulary of 1988. The voices of anxiety have been unceasing, creating quite a stir. However, someone has already pointed out that "what has not been doubted is precisely the doubt itself." Now that this turmoil has subsided, the vast majority of young students are reflecting. Many people painfully ask, "We thought we had sincere intentions to worry about the country and the people, so why did we get involved in this turmoil that almost threatened the future and destiny of the Party and the state? Those who claim to be 'calling for a national sense of anxiety,' why is their 'anxiety' so incompatible with that of the people and the Party Central Committee? What kind of anxiety consciousness does the Party and the people expect from young intellectuals? This cannot but prompt people to reflect deeply.

Anxiety consciousness, in the sense of worrying about the country and the people, is not a bad thing and is not new. The history of modern China is a history of advanced Chinese people worrying about the country and the people and struggling to save the country and the people. Chinese Communists, with a strong desire to worry about the country and the people, found Marxism and socialism, and after 28 years of arduous struggle, established the great People's Republic of China. After the founding of New China, our Party has also been vigilant, advocating anxiety consciousness. On the eve of the founding of the nation, Comrade Mao Zedong warned the entire Party to be vigilant against arrogance, the tendency to stagnate and not seek progress, and the tendency to seek pleasure and not want to live a hard life again. After the founding of the nation, he repeatedly emphasized the need to overcome arrogance and self-satisfaction, and the tendency to be self-satisfied and closed-minded. At the same time, the Party Central Committee led the entire Party and the people of the whole country to make arduous explorations for the smooth construction of the socialist cause in China. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Chinese Communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their representative, through a comparison of both positive and negative aspects, have decided to lead the Chinese people to get rid of poverty and catch up with the advanced level of the world. Their anxiety consciousness has a higher perspective and historical sense and has entered the conscious stage, beginning the process of reform and opening up. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "Reform is the self-improvement of socialism." It seeks to negate everything that is unrealistic, outdated, and attached to socialism, not socialism itself, and it seeks to fully and consistently demonstrate the superiority of socialism. The achievements recognized by the world since the reform and opening up have proven that this conscious anxiety consciousness is the crystallization and sublimation of the anxiety consciousness of the Chinese nation to strengthen the country and enrich the people over the past hundred years, representing the revival and hope of the Chinese nation, becoming the main melody of the times, and winning the sincere support of the people of the whole country.

However, we have indeed seen that the "anxiety" of those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization is fundamentally different from that of our Party. They put on a very "anxious" face, their emotions are so fervent, and their words are so fierce, as if except for them, in such a large China, there is no one else who worries about the country and the people. However, their anxiety, with its negative criticism, is directed at the entire socialist system, pursuing a capitalist political and economic system.

Obviously, due to the fundamental differences in stance and starting point, there are two completely opposite views on anxiety. Then, what is the difference between the two views on anxiety, and what kind of anxiety consciousness should young intellectuals have? Here is a preliminary analysis.

First, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is based on a correct understanding of the national conditions, while that view of anxiety that takes the West as a reference system is subjective idealism. As a kind of social consciousness, the emotional "dressing" of anxiety consciousness cannot change its essence as a reflection of social existence. It must adapt to social existence. "The greatest trouble in the world is to not know why things are the way they are." Anxiety first of all is to figure out what the trouble is. Our Party advocates building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is to advocate seeking truth from facts and starting from the national conditions of China. This does not exclude the need to broaden one's horizons in understanding the crux of China's problems and to take the development of the world as an important reference system. However, all these comparisons are for the purpose of deepening the understanding of China's problems and grasping our own special historical, natural, and social conditions to choose a development path suitable for ourselves. "The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strengthening the country," and "only socialism can save China." These words seem simple, but they are scientific conclusions drawn by the Chinese people after countless explorations, conforming to historical laws. They contain and condense the main content of a nation's anxiety over nearly a hundred years. The so-called "social elites" anxiety is based on the so-called "Western civilization." Since they claim that "modernization is Westernization" and "the United States is the center of world civilization," and attack patriotism as "a narrow sentiment," the "anxiety" they claim is actually to use Western ideas, values, and political and economic systems to review and criticize everything in China. How can they prescribe a remedy that suits China's reality? Many young students care about the future of the motherland, which is good, but they have not yet entered society and lack a practical understanding of the most basic requirements of the 1.1 billion people in China and the most urgent real crisis in our country. Their anxiety has a bit of the flavor of "youth unaware of sorrow" and "forcing new words to express sorrow." We need to guide young people to go deep into society and reality, understand the national conditions of China. Regarding why China cannot adopt the three powers of separation and multiparty system of the West? How to build our high-level socialist democracy? Why it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and not to copy the consumption model of the West? Why we must adhere to the public ownership as the mainstay and not to privatize the economy? Why it is said that stability is the greatest interest of China, and we must resolutely oppose turmoil? All these need to help them combine with the national conditions of China to think deeply, so that they can truly understand that only by firmly standing on this land of China, the anxiety of young intellectuals can hit the nail on the head and truly play a role in promoting the good and eliminating the bad.

Second, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is unified with national pride and self-confidence, and we do not advocate spreading nihilism and failure emotions. We say that anxiety can revive the country, meaning that an urgent sense of crisis can make people vigilant and strive to enhance the cohesion of the nation. At the same time, we must also point out that anxiety cannot be separated from national self-confidence. Anxiety without self-confidence can only lead to negativity and decline, and there is no question of any cohesion. Anxiety and national self-confidence are an indispensable unity of national rationality, not mutually exclusive. As Mr. Lu Xun said: "Although the Han and Tang dynasties also had border troubles, their spirit was indeed great, and the people had the self-confidence not to be slaves of other races, or they did not even think about it. Whenever they adopted foreign things, they would treat them as captives and use them freely, without any hesitation." (_Tomb · Reflection on Looking in the Mirror_) But what kind of anxiety consciousness does "River Elegy" arouse? They not only use "anxiety" to deny the five-thousand-year civilization, declare the "setting of the Asian sun," and believe that the unyielding struggle of the Chinese nation in the past hundred years has provided people with "only darkness, humiliation, and setbacks," but also the socialist revolution and construction since the founding of the nation have left them with "only sorrow and bitterness." They attack patriotism as "causing a near-pathological sense of self-worth and a delusional national megalomania," and deliberately spread a sense of failure, seriously eroding our national self-confidence and cohesion. If the process of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people's revolution is to make the Chinese people, who were once called "a heap of loose sand" and "the sick man of East Asia," gain the confidence to control their own destiny, and thus be able to resist and overcome internal and external troubles and stand tall in the world, then today, the "elites" are trying to destroy the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation's cohesion, which constitutes a greater crisis behind all specific difficulties. Isn't this enough to make us anxious and reflect?

Third, the anxiety consciousness we advocate is the unity of criticism and construction. Doubting everything and negating everything will only lead to hostility and destructive emotions towards reality. Anxiety consciousness is not purely expressed as a negative value orientation because it simultaneously contains constructive thinking beyond itself. Negation contains affirmation, reflecting on mistakes and shortcomings, and at the same time affirming the correct and promoting the good, which is the dialectical attitude that rational thinking should have. For the twists and turns and mistakes in the construction of our country since its founding, we should reflect deeply, reflect to transcend and move forward; for various social ills at present, of course, we should expose and criticize, expose and criticize to uphold justice and improve the social mechanism. The so-called "maintaining a thorough critical attitude towards reality," "hating this kind of thing for 30 years," and even "hating to kick China twice" are all expressions of hatred that have no trace of rational anxiety dialectical attitude! Such "anxiety" will only lead to the destruction of society rather than construction and creation, which has been fully proven in this turmoil and riot. Take the phenomenon of corruption that the people and young students across the country are extremely concerned about. The anxiety of young students and the anxiety of the Party and the people should be completely consistent. "The issue of party style is a matter of life and death for the Party." This is a profound anxiety! If, in the estimation of the situation of corruption, the deep social causes of the emergence of corruption, and the corresponding institutional construction and measures, a consensus is formed among the whole Party and the whole people, it will certainly form a powerful supervisory force, greatly promoting the improvement of party style and social atmosphere. However, if, like some people, shouting the slogan of "overthrowing the corrupt government," directing the spearhead at the entire Party and all levels of government, and adopting the "overthrow" form of the Cultural Revolution, it will not only fail to achieve constructive results but will also cause social turmoil, making good intentions go to the opposite of their wishes. This is indeed alarming.

Fourth, we advocate that intellectuals share the anxiety of the people of the whole country, while a few conspirators want to use young intellectuals as tools for political struggle. Intellectuals, as part of the working class, should share the anxiety of the people of the whole country and truly reflect the interests of the masses. In fact, since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the status of intellectuals has been improved, and the Party and the government pay great attention to listening to their opinions and encouraging them to make positive explorations on the development path of socialism. However, there are indeed a few conspirators who cannot represent the mainstream of intellectuals and want to be independent of the people, the working class, the Party, and the government. Fang Lizhi has long proposed that "intellectuals should become an independent leading force," and in this student movement, he openly proposed that "the intellectual circle should form a group to exert pressure on the authorities," and to form a "pressure group." Such an anxiety consciousness is a rebellious consciousness that is opposed to the consciousness of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist state. In order to tie more intellectuals to their chariot, they slander those intellectuals who do not follow them to make trouble and firmly guard their work and study posts as having "no sense of mission and social responsibility," and say that "devoting oneself to one's profession only belongs to a lower level of value orientation," and only going out to make trouble can show a high-level value orientation of "ultimate concern." However, the process from this student movement to turmoil and riot has precisely shown that those intellectuals who firmly guard their work posts and resolutely resist their tricks truly show a high sense of mission and social responsibility; in the face of the erroneous tide, many people who are not moved are precisely out of concern for the fate of the Party and the state, which can be said to be a kind of political participation that shows a high degree of political awareness and anxiety. Their anxiety is in sync with the pulse of the Party and the people, truly reflecting the mainstream of contemporary intellectuals' anxiety consciousness. Reflecting on the lessons of this turmoil, many young students feel deeply harmed by bourgeois liberalization, falling into the danger of placing themselves in a position incompatible with the Party and the people, with the workers and peasants. We should encourage them to engage in social practice, in the process of learning from the people, to correct their position in social life, and truly share the anxiety with the Party and the people.

Fifth, as a kind of rational evaluation and criticism, we emphasize that anxiety consciousness must be guided by Marxism, while the anxiety consciousness of those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization is based on the bourgeois worldview. Although some people have avoided talking about worldviews in recent years, people's anxiety consciousness is inevitably influenced by worldviews. We might as well flip through the pages of anxiety in Chinese modern and contemporary thought history. Among intellectuals, Kang Youwei and Sun Yat-sen, Li Dazhao and Hu Shi, Lu Xun and Liang Shiqiu, their anxieties are so different! And only the advanced intellectuals of China who have mastered the theoretical weapons of Marxism have made the anxiety consciousness of the Chinese nation to save the country and strengthen the country enter the conscious stage. An important lesson from the occurrence and development of this student movement into turmoil is that in recent years we have abandoned the ideological battlefield and allowed bourgeois liberalization to spread. For many young intellectuals, the ten years of turmoil left them with an irreparable spiritual trauma and cultural vacuum. When they woke up from the nightmare and entered the process of painful reflection and criticism of society, a large number of Western political and cultural theories surged in, making them unable to distinguish between good and bad and difficult to resist. And their anxiety emotions, which are highly situational, intense, and short-lived, are easily bewitched or used, and there are countless examples of young students' sensory emotional judgments being used and misled by a few people in the process of turmoil. This once again raises the necessity of systematic Marxist worldview education.

After this fierce struggle, our nation's anxiety has been elevated to a new level. We should calmly consider the past and also consider the future. How will the Chinese nation revive its national spirit, strive for self-improvement, unite and stand up? How can we make our socialist system more vibrant? We need the whole nation to think calmly at a higher level and a more conscious state. Facing the challenges of the turn of the century, we still have to say, anxiety can bring enlightenment. The problem is not in anxiety, but in how to be anxious. Let us endure hardships and strive unremittingly.

    我们需要什么样的忧患意识？
　　黄宏
    近两年来，“忧患”成了热门话题。1988年初，有《世界经济导报》关于“球籍”问题的讨论，中间又有《河殇》所作蔚蓝色文明取代黄色文明的大肆渲染，岁末严家其与温元凯推出了“关于时局的对话”，说什么“治理整顿”将使中国陷入“长期停滞”。这次学潮和动乱也是充斥着各种各样的忧患。顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人称“忧患”是“1988年改革语汇中使用频率最高的词汇之一”。忧患之声不绝于耳，很是热闹了一番。然而早就有人指出，“没有受到怀疑的，恰恰是怀疑本身”。现在，这场动乱平息了，广大青年学生都在反思。不少人痛心地提出，我们自以为满怀忧国忧民的初衷和赤诚，何以在忧患声中卷入到这场几乎危及党和国家前途命运的动乱中来？一些自称“在呼唤全民族忧患意识”的人，他们的“忧患”与全国人民、党中央的忧患为何如此的冰炭不容？党和人民期待青年知识分子的是什么样的忧患意识？这不能不促使人们作出深入的反思。
    忧患意识，从忧国忧民的意义上说，并不是一件坏事，也不自今日始。一部中国近代史就是先进的中国人忧国忧民，为救国救民而奋斗的历史。中国共产党人也是怀着忧国忧民的强烈愿望，找到了马克思主义，找到了社会主义，经过28年艰苦卓绝的奋斗，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国的。新中国成立以后，我们党也是警钟长鸣，提倡忧患意识。建国前夕，毛泽东同志就告诫全党，要警惕骄傲情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪。建国以后，又多次强调，要克服骄傲自满，固步自封的情绪。与此同时，党中央带领全党和全国人民对于我国社会主义事业的顺利建设作了艰苦的探索。党的十一届三中全会以来，以邓小平同志为代表的中国共产党人通过正反两个方面的比较，其决心带领中国人民摆脱贫困赶上世界先进水平的忧患意识有了更高的视角和历史感，进入了自觉的阶段，开始了改革开放的历史进程。正如邓小平所指出的，“改革是社会主义的自我完善”，它所要否定的是各种脱离现实的、过时的、附加于社会主义的东西，而不是社会主义本身，它所追求的是社会主义优越性充分一贯地发挥。改革开放以来举世公认的成绩雄辩地证明，这种自觉的忧患意识是一百多年来中华民族富国图强忧患意识的凝聚和升华，代表了中华民族的复兴和希望，成为时代的主旋律，得到了全国人民的衷心拥护。
    但是，我们也确实看到，那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人的“忧患”与我们党的忧患是根本不同的。他们摆出一副非常“忧患”的面孔，其情绪之激昂，言词之激烈，仿佛除他们之外，在偌大一个中国，再也没有其他人是忧国忧民的了。然而，他们的忧患，其否定性批判的矛头是对着整个的社会主义制度，追求的是资本主义的政治经济制度。
    很明显，由于根本立场和出发点的不同，有两种完全对立的忧患观。那么，两种忧患观的区别何在，什么是青年知识分子应有的忧患意识呢？这里作一初步的分析。
    第一，我们提倡的忧患意识是以对国情的正确把握为基础的，而那种一切以西方为参照系的忧患观则是主观唯心论。作为一种社会意识，忧患意识情感的“装扮”并不能改变其作为社会存在反映的本质，它必须与社会存在相适应。“天下之患，莫大于不知其然而然”，忧患首先就要弄清患在哪里。我们党提出建设具有中国特色的社会主义，就是提倡实事求是，一切从中国国情出发。这决不排斥在认识中国问题的症结时要开阔视野，把世界发展作为重要的参照系，但是这一切比较都是为了加深对中国问题的认识，把握自己特殊的历史、自然、社会条件，选择适合自己的发展道路。“四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路”，“只有社会主义才能救中国”，这些话似乎简单，却是中国人民经过无数次探索得出的符合历史规律的科学结论，它蕴含、浓缩着一个民族近百年忧患的主要内容。那些所谓“社会精英”们的忧患，则是以所谓的“西方文明”为本体的。既然他们声称“现代化就是西方化”、“美国是世界文明的中心”，又攻击爱国主义“是一种狭隘的情感”，他们声称的“忧患”，其实就是用西方的思想价值观念和政治、经济制度来审视和批判中国的一切，这怎么能开出符合中国实际的药方呢？许多青年学生关心祖国前途固然很好，但他们还没有步入社会，对中国11亿人最基本的要求和我国最急迫的现实危机是什么缺乏实际的了解，他们的忧患，带有一点“少年不识愁滋味”、“为赋新词强说愁”的味道。我们要引导青年深入社会，深入实际，认识中国国情。对于为什么说中国不能搞西方的三权鼎立、多党制？如何建设我国的高度社会主义民主？为什么需要发扬艰苦奋斗精神，不能照搬西方的消费模式？为什么要坚持公有制为主体，不能搞经济私有化？为什么说稳定是中国的最大利益所在，要坚决反对动乱？等等，都需要帮助他们结合中国国情，作出深入的思考，使他们真正懂得，只有坚实地站在中国这块土地上，青年知识分子的忧患才能切中时弊，真正起到兴利除弊的作用。
    第二，我们提倡的忧患意识与民族自豪感、自信心是统一的，决不是主张散布虚无主义和失败情绪。我们说忧患可以兴邦，是说急迫的危机感，能使人警钟长鸣，催人奋起，有助于增强民族的凝聚力。同时我们也还需要指出，忧患感不能脱离民族自信心，失去自信心的忧患只能导向消极和沉沦，是谈不上任何凝聚力的。忧患感和民族自信心是民族理性缺一不可的统一整体，不是互相排斥的。正如鲁迅先生所说：“汉唐虽然也有边患，但魄力究竟雄大，人民具有不至于为异族奴隶的自信心，或者竟毫未想到，凡取用外来事物的时候，就如将彼俘来一样，自由驱使，绝不介怀。”　（《坟·看镜有感》）而
  《河殇》唤起的是什么样的忧患意识呢？他们不仅以“忧患”为名，否定五千年的文明史，宣告“亚细亚太阳的陨落”，认为近百年来中华民族不屈不挠斗争提供给人们的“只有黑暗、屈辱和挫折”，而且建国以来我国社会主义革命和建设留在他们记忆中的也只有“沉痛和苦涩”。他们攻击爱国主义“造成近似病态的自尊心和虚骄的民族夸大狂”，竭力散布失败主义情绪，严重消蚀着我们民族的自信心和凝聚力。如果说中国共产党领导中国人民革命的过程，就是使曾被称为“一盘散沙”、“东亚病夫”的中国人民获得了掌握自己命运的信心，因而能够抵御和战胜内患外辱，屹立于世界的话，那么可以说，今天“精英”们竭力摧毁中华民族赖以凝聚的民族精神支柱，则构成了潜在一切具体困难之后的更大危机。这一切难道还不足以促使我们忧患和反思吗？
    第三，我们提倡的忧患意识是批判性与建设性的统一，怀疑一切、否定一切只会导向对现实社会的敌视和破坏情绪。忧患意识不单纯表现为否定的价值定向，因为它本身同时蕴含着超越自身的建构性思考。否定中包含着肯定，反省失误和不足，同时也要肯定正确和扬其所长，这正是理性思维所应有的辩证态度。对建国以来我国建设的曲折和失误应该作深刻的反思，反思是为了扬弃和前进；对当前各种社会积弊，当然要揭露和抨击，揭露和抨击是为伸张正义，完善社会机制。所谓
  “对现实坚持彻底的批判态度”，“恨透了30年这种东西”，乃至“恨不得踢中国两脚”此类的仇恨情绪宣泄，哪里有一丝一毫理性忧患辩证态度的影子！这样的“忧患”只会导向对社会的破坏而不是建设和创造，这一点在这次动乱和暴乱中已经得到了充分的证明。就以全国人民和青年学生都极为忧虑的腐败现象来说，青年学生的忧患与党和人民的忧患本来是可以完全一致的，“党风问题是有关党的生死存亡的问题”，这是何等深沉的忧患！如果在对腐败状况的估计，腐败现象产生的深刻社会原因，以及相应的制度建设和措施上形成全党、全民的共识，必然会形成强大的监督力量，大大促进党风和社会风气好转。可是如果像某些人那样，喊出“打倒腐败政府”的口号，把矛头对准整个党和各级政府，而且采用“文化大革命”那样一种否定一切的“打倒”的形式，就非但不能取得建设性的成果，而且会造成社会的动乱，使良好的初衷走向了自己愿望的反面，这确实是令人警惕的。
    第四，我们提倡知识分子与全国人民共忧患，少数野心家则是企图把青年知识分子作为政治斗争的工具。知识分子作为工人阶级的一部分，应当与全国人民共忧患，真正反映人民群众的利益。事实上自党的十一届三中全会以来，知识分子的地位得到改善，党和政府十分注意倾听他们的意见，鼓励他们对社会主义发展道路作出积极的探索。但是确有少数并不能代表知识分子主体的野心家、阴谋家要与人民群众、与工人阶级、与党和政府闹独立。方励之早就提出“知识分子要成为独立的领导力量”，在这次学潮中又公开提出“知识界要以形成集团的方式造成对当局的压力”，搞什么“压力集团”。这样一种忧患意识是与中国共产党和社会主义国家意识相敌对的造反意识。为了把更多的知识分子捆到他们的战车上，他们污蔑那些不跟他们闹事、坚守工作学习岗位的知识分子“没有使命感和社会责任感”，胡说什么“献身于自己的专业只属于较低层次的价值取向”，只有上街闹事，才表现出高层次价值取向的“终极关怀”。而这次从学潮到动乱和暴乱的过程，恰恰说明那些坚守工作岗位，坚决抵制他们那套的知识分子真正表现出了很高的使命感和社会责任感；在错误潮流袭来时很多不为所动的人，恰恰是出于对党和国家命运的关切，可以说这才是一种表现了高度政治觉悟和忧患感的“政治参与”。他们的忧患与党和人民的忧患共脉搏，真正体现了当代知识分子忧患意识的主流。反思这次动乱的教训，不少青年学生感到深受资产阶级自由化的毒害，陷入了把自己置于了一个与党和人民，与工农大众格格不入的地位的危险。我们要鼓励他们投身社会实践，在向人民群众学习的社会过程中摆正自己在社会生活中的位置，真正与党和人民共忧患。
    第五，作为一种理性的评价和批判，我们强调忧患意识必须以马克思主义作指导，而顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人的忧患意识的核心则是资产阶级的世界观。尽管这几年有些人们讳言世界观，然而人们的忧患意识却不可避免地受到世界观的影响。我们不妨翻翻中国近现代思想史的忧患篇，同是知识分子，康有为与孙中山，李大钊与胡适，鲁迅与梁实秋他们的忧患是何等的不同！而只有中国先进的知识分子掌握了马克思主义的理论武器，才使中华民族救亡图强的忧患意识进入了自觉的程度。这次学潮发生和演变为动乱的重要教训，就在于这几年我们放弃了思想阵地，听任资产阶级自由化泛滥。就许多青年知识分子来说，十年动乱给他们留下了难以弥合的精神创伤和文化空白。在他们从噩梦中醒来，进入对社会痛苦反思和批判的时候，大量西方的政治文化学说潮水般地涌来，使他们良莠不分、难以抵挡。而他们那种带有很大情景性、激烈性和短暂性的忧患情绪，又极易被蛊惑或利用，动乱过程中青年学生感性情感判断被少数人利用、误导的例子比比皆是。这就再一次提出了进行系统的马克思主义世界观教育的必要性。
    经过这场严酷斗争的洗礼之后，我们民族的忧患感升华到一个新的境界。应当冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来。中华民族将如何重振民族精神，励精图志，团结奋起？怎样使我们的社会主义制度更具青春的活力？需要全民族在更高层次、更自觉状态下的冷静思考。面临世纪之交的挑战，我们仍然要说，殷忧可以启明。问题不在于忧患，而在于怎样忧患。让我们卧薪尝胆，自强不息。
