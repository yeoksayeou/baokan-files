	China's textile industry has flourished over the past 40 years, with several key projects now ranking among the world's best in the fiercely competitive global textile arena.

	Currently, China boasts 31.54 million cotton spinning spindles, leading the world in both cotton yarn and cotton fabric production. With 2.26 million wool spinning spindles, China is the world's second-largest producer of wool textiles. The export earnings from textiles have surpassed $10 billion, placing China third in the world. The synthetic fiber industry, which emerged post-liberation, has grown at a rate surpassing that of major synthetic fiber-producing countries, reaching a production capacity of 18.1 million tons and ranking fourth globally.

	Through its own efforts, China's textile industry has adequately addressed the clothing needs of its 1.1 billion people at a medium level.

	Textile Industry Minister Wu Wenying recently proudly announced that even on a per capita basis, China's current textile consumption has reached 18 meters, five times that of the early liberation period. Currently, the Chinese people's demand for textiles is shifting towards a more prosperous standard.

    据新华社北京9月14日电　（记者李安定）我国纺织工业经过40年的建设，一批重要项目已在激烈的国际纺织业竞技场中位居前列。
    目前我国拥有棉纺纱锭3154万锭，棉纱、棉布产量居世界冠军；毛纺锭226万锭，毛纺产量为世界亚军；纺织品出口净创汇突破100亿美元，居世界第三位；解放后异军突起的化纤工业，以超过各主要化纤生产国的发展速度达到生产能力181万吨，居世界第四位。
    中国纺织工业依靠自己的努力已经中等水平地解决了11亿人民的穿衣问题。
    纺织部长吴文英日前自豪地宣布，即使按人均计算，我国目前纺织品人均占有量也已达到18米，是解放初期的5倍。目前我国人民对纺织品的需求正向小康型发展。
