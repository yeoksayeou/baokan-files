The North Korean government held a banquet at the People's Culture Palace in Pyongyang today to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of North Korea.

Prime Minister Yon Hyong-muk, in his speech at the banquet, said that since the founding of North Korea, the people have fully demonstrated their spirit of independence and creativity in all aspects of social life, turning their country into a prosperous and flourishing socialist state. The history of North Korea over the past 40-plus years has powerfully demonstrated the superiority and vitality of the socialist system.
