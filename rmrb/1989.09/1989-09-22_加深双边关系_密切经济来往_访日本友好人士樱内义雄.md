Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 22nd

In the autumn of September, Tokyo basked in the warm sunlight and gentle breezes. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our reporters visited Sakura Naoyuki, a renowned Japanese politician and member of the House of Representatives, who has long been dedicated to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

"My feelings are in sync with those of the Chinese people," said the elderly Sakura, his voice filled with emotion. He mentioned that 35 years ago, he had visited China, and over the long years, he had developed a deep affection for the country. On the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China, he hoped that Japan and China could join hands and develop together.

At 76 years old, Sakura has served as the Secretary-General and Chairman of the Policy Research Council of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He has held key positions in the government, including Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of International Trade and Industry, and Minister of Construction. This veteran of the Liberal Democratic Party, who has been elected to the House of Representatives 15 times, is currently the President of the Japan External Trade Organization, focusing on trade activities with China.

Sakura said that over the past 40 years, China's achievements are evident to all. In the past decade, the reform and opening-up policies pursued by the Chinese government have been yielding continuous results.

When discussing the recent situation in China, Sakura believed that the events of the "June Fourth Incident" were China's internal affairs. Currently, China has restored order, and everything is returning to normal. He hoped for political stability in China, so that the Japanese business community could gradually regain confidence, dispel doubts, and continue to expand investments and trade with China.

When discussing the friendly relations between Japan and China and their prospects, this elderly man, who has visited China 11 times, spoke eloquently. He said that although China has recently experienced turmoil, the friendly relations between the two countries, especially economic exchanges, should not be hindered. Reviewing the development of Sino-Japanese friendly relations, although there have been twists and turns at times, overall, it has been good and smooth. Chinese leaders often say that China and Japan should be friends for generations to come, and this is also our wish.

Sakura emphasized that Japan and China should cherish this neighborly relationship, continue to strengthen cooperation and exchanges in political, economic, and cultural aspects, and deepen bilateral relations.

Sakura revealed that at the end of November to the beginning of December this year, he will lead a large delegation composed of key figures from the Japanese business community to visit China again.

    加深双边关系　密切经济来往
    ——访日本友好人士樱内义雄
    新华社记者　朱荣根　谈建荣
    9月的东京，秋阳杲杲，微风徐徐。在中华人民共和国诞生40周年之际，记者访问了长期致力于日中友好事业的日本著名政治家、众议院议员樱内义雄先生。
    “我的心情是与中国人民的心情一致的，也可以说是同步的，”年逾古稀的樱内先生深情地说。他说，35年前他就访问了中国，经过漫长的岁月，他对中国怀有亲近的感情。在新中国成立40周年的时候，他希望日中两国携手并肩，共同发展。
    76岁高龄的樱内先生，曾任日本执政党自民党的干事长、政调会长，在政府中曾任外相、通产相、建设相等要职。这位曾15次当选为众议员的自民党元老，现任日本国际贸易促进会会长，专门从事与中国的贸易活动。
    樱内先生说，40年来，中国所取得的成绩是有目共睹的。近10年来中国政府所奉行的改革开放政策正不断取得成果。
    在谈到中国最近的局势时，樱内先生认为，前段时间发生的“天安门事件”是中国的内政，目前中国已恢复秩序，一切趋于正常。他希望中国国内政治稳定，这样，日本经济界将逐渐恢复信心，打消疑虑，继续扩大对华投资和贸易。
    在谈到日中两国友好关系及发展前景时，这位访华已11次的老人侃侃而谈。他说，尽管中国最近发生了动乱，但两国的友好关系，特别是经济往来，不应因此而受到阻碍。回顾日中友好关系的发展，虽然有时也出现曲折，但总的来说是好的，发展是顺利的，中国领导人经常说，中日两国要世世代代友好下去，这同时也是我们的愿望。
    樱内先生强调说，日中两国应相互珍惜这一睦邻关系，继续密切双边的政治、经济、文化等方面的合作与交往。
    樱内先生透露，今年11月末到12月初，他将率领一个由日本经济界要人组成的大型代表团再度访问中国。
