Today, 113 foreign-related hotels in China received star ratings from the National Tourism Foreign-Related Hotel Star Rating Committee at the Kunlun Hotel in Beijing. This marks the beginning of a new stage in the modernization of China's hotel industry.

Among the 113 hotels that received star ratings, there are 5 four-star hotels: Beijing Changcheng Hotel, Beijing Kunlun Hotel, Guilin Guilin Mountain Hotel, Xiamen Yuehua Hotel, and Wuxi Grand Hotel in Jiangsu (provisional star rating). There are also 44 three-star hotels, 52 two-star hotels, and 12 one-star hotels.

The hotel star rating system is a universal "language" in the international hotel industry. The implementation of the star rating system in China's hotel industry provides specific professional standards for the construction and renovation of hotels in the future, and unified targets and criteria for enterprise and industry management. Currently, China has a total of 135 foreign-related hotels with star ratings, including the 22 hotels that received star ratings for the first time in May this year.

Leaders such as Wu Xueqian and Chen Muhua attended the star rating award ceremony today and presented certificates to the hotels that received star ratings.
