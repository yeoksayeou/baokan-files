Special Report by Chen Te-an

On the afternoon of September 4th, around 3:40 PM, the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center's Churchill Hall was bustling with activity. Delegates from various countries were engaged in lively pre-meeting diplomatic exchanges. People were whispering to each other or gathered in small groups, discussing. According to the meeting agenda, a debate on the supplementary agenda items of this session seemed inevitable.

At around 4 PM, the delegates took their seats, and the meeting began. The Iraqi delegate who originally proposed the "Two Iraqs Peace Exchange of Prisoners" motion spoke first, expressing a willingness to yield to Spain's proposal for "Supporting the Independence Process of Namibia." Following this, the Turkish delegate spoke, withdrawing a previous proposal related to relations with neighboring countries. Then, a female delegate from the Federal Republic of Germany took the stage, waving the banner of "human rights," and presented a so-called "motion" on "China's suppression of peaceful protesters." She hoped that the attendees would "support" her motion.

At this point, the head of the Chinese National People's Congress delegation, Fu Hao, raised his right hand high, requesting to speak. After receiving permission from the chairman, he calmly walked onto the stage and sternly refuted the so-called "motion." He said: "The Federal Republic of Germany delegation, without regard for the facts, based only on some unfounded reports and rumors, brought up the issue of China's suppression of a riot aimed at overthrowing the People's Republic of China. This is a purely internal matter of a sovereign state. Bringing it to the international stage is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, a trampling of internationally recognized principles of international relations, and a violation of the purpose of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to 'promote international peace and cooperation.' The Chinese National People's Congress delegation expresses great indignation over this." The 1,400-plus delegates of various races listened intently and pondered.

Regarding the adoption of the "motion," the chairman announced a vote. Delegates from over 100 countries expressed their positions on this "motion." The result was 393 votes against, 509 abstentions, and 335 votes in favor, thereby rejecting the motion.

After the meeting, many country delegations specially came to congratulate the Chinese delegation. Before the meeting, many country delegations had already expressed their understanding and support for China's stance.

An ancient Chinese book, "Xunzi: Da Lue," has a famous saying: "Rumors cease with the wise." Indeed, like the motion put forward by the Federal Republic of Germany delegation, which does not consider the facts and is based solely on rumors, it cannot withstand scrutiny in front of the wise people of the world and has no market. For strategically-minded politicians, they first consider that China plays an indispensable role in maintaining world peace and development.

### 流言止于智者——记各国议联否决西德“提案”

    流言止于智者
    ——记各国议联否决西德“提案”
    本报记者　陈特安
    9月4日下午3时40分前后，女王伊丽莎白二世会议中心的丘吉尔礼堂内外一片繁忙，与会各国议员代表的会前外交活动颇为活跃。人们彼此交头接耳，或三两成群地在交谈着。根据会议议程，一场关于本届大会补充议题的争辩看来是不可避免地要发生了。
    4时许，代表们在各自的席位上就座，大会开始。原来提出关于“两伊和平交换战俘”提案的伊拉克议员代表首先发言，表示愿为西班牙提出的“支持纳米比亚独立进程”提案“让路”。接着，土耳其议员代表发言，表示收回它原来提出的与邻国关系的一项提案。紧接着，一位联邦德国女议员代表走上讲台，打着维护“人权”的旗号，抛出了所谓“中国镇压和平抗议者”的“提案”。并希望与会者“支持”她的提案。
    这时，中国全国人大代表团团长符浩高高地举起右手，要求发言。得到大会主席允许后，他不慌不忙步上讲台，义正词严地驳斥了这个所谓“提案”。他说：联邦德国议员团“不顾事实真相，只凭一些不符事实的报道和造谣”，就把中国平息旨在颠覆中华人民共和国的暴乱这样一个纯属主权国家的内政问题提到国际讲坛上来，“这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是对举世公认的国际关系准则的践踏，也是违背各国议会联盟‘促进国际和平与合作’的宗旨的，中国全国人大代表团对此表示极大的愤慨”。会场里，1400多位各种肤色的代表倾听着，思索着。
    对于“提案”的取舍，大会主席宣布进行表决。与会的100多个国家议员团都逐一地对这一“提案”表明了自己的立场。结果以393票反对、509票弃权、335票赞成否决了这项“提案”。
    会后，有许多国家代表团特意前来向中国代表团表示祝贺。会前也已有不少国家代表团对中国的立场表示理解和支持。
    中国古书《荀子·大略》中有句名言说：“流言止于智者”。的确，像联邦德国议员团抛出的这一类“不顾事实真相”、“单凭谣言”为依据的“提案”，在世界各国有识之士面前就经不起推敲、没有市场了。对于有战略眼光的政治家来说，他们首先考虑到的是，中国在维护世界和平与发展中有着不可忽视的地位和作用。（本报伦敦9月5日电）
