Forty years have passed, and Taiwan has undergone tremendous changes in politics, economy, society, and culture.

Politically, the Kuomintang regime began "political reforms" in 1986. On July 14, 1987, it announced the lifting of the martial law that had been in effect for 38 years, replacing it with the so-called "National Security Law during the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Rebellion." The following year, on January 1, it declared the lifting of the ban on the press. In January 1989, it lifted the ban on political parties. The Taiwan authorities also made some adjustments to their mainland policy.

Over the past 40 years, Taiwan's economy has also changed significantly. From 1952 to 1988, Taiwan's economy grew at an average annual rate of 8.6%. During the same period, the gross national product increased from $1.66 billion to $125.3 billion, and the per capita gross national product increased from $205.5 to $6,053. Starting in 1985, Taiwan began its "third economic reform" aimed at "internationalization, liberalization, and institutionalization" of the economy, with the goal of promoting industrial upgrading and achieving stable economic growth. However, due to the scarcity of resources and heavy reliance on foreign trade, Taiwan's economic foundation is relatively fragile and susceptible to fluctuations. In recent years, the rise of international trade protectionism and the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar have made Taiwan's economy face difficulties.

Taiwan's society has become increasingly diversified, with citizens' sense of autonomy and rights awareness reaching unprecedented heights. Various forms of "self-help" movements have emerged. At the same time, the crime rate has surged, gambling and speculation are rampant, and criminal activities are rampant, reflecting the decline of the Kuomintang regime's public power and credibility, and exposing the dark side of capitalist society.

In terms of culture and education, Taiwan currently has over 6,500 schools of various types, with a total student population of over 5.1 million, including approximately 450,000 in higher education. In 1987, the higher education enrollment rate was 24.9 per thousand. In addition, Taiwan has research institutions such as the "Academia Sinica," "Industrial Technology Research Institute," and "Chiang Kai-shek Science Research Institute," with over 10,000 scientific and technological personnel.

　　台湾现状透视
　　杨梓
    40年的岁月流逝，台湾在政治、经济、社会、文化等方面，均发生了巨大的变化。
    政治上，国民党当局从1986年开始进行“政治革新”。1987年7月14日宣布解除实施达38年之久的“戒严令”，代之以所谓“动员勘乱时期国家安全法”。次年1月1日宣告解除“报禁”。1989年1月，解除“党禁”。台湾当局也对其大陆政策作了某些调整。
    40年来，台湾经济也发生了很大变化。从1952年到1988年，台湾经济年平均增长率为8.6％，同期“国民生产”毛额从16.6亿美元增加到1253亿美元，人均“国民生产”毛额从205.5美元增加到6053美元。从1985年开始，台湾开始进行以经济“国际化、自由化、制度化”为目标的“第三次经济改革”，旨在促进工业升级，谋求经济稳定增长。但是，由于台湾资源奇缺，过于依赖对外贸易，使经济基础比较脆弱和易受波动。近年来，国际贸易保护主义抬头，台币升值，更使台湾经济面临难关。
    台湾社会日前多元化，民众的自主和权利意识空前高涨，各种名目的“自力救济”运动层出不穷。与此同时，社会犯罪率急剧上升，赌博投机之风盛行，黑社会活动猖獗，显示国民党当局公权力、公信力式微，暴露了资本主义社会的黑暗面。
    在文化教育方面，台湾现有各类学校6500多所，学生总数达510多万人，其中专科以上约45万；1987年高等教育人口千分比为24.9‰。除此之外，台湾还有“中央研究院”、“工业技术研究院”、“中山科学研究院”等科研机构，有各类科技人才1万多人。　（台湾研究会供稿）
