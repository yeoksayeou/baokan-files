The largest street disturbance in Europe to date occurred at the end of the London Notting Hill Carnival, resulting in the arrest of 300 people and injuries to 30 police officers.

The two-day carnival, which attracted 500,000 visitors, had been proceeding smoothly. However, on the evening of the 28th, some young people began throwing stones and bottles at the police, leading to the outbreak of violence. The police then took strong measures to disperse the crowd.

    伦敦狂欢节发生暴力事件
    在伦敦诺廷希尔狂欢节结束时，发生了欧洲迄今最大的街头事件，三百人被逮捕，三十名警察受伤。
    吸引了五十万游客的两天狂欢活动一直进行得很顺利。但是，二十八日晚一些年轻人开始向警察投掷石块、瓶子，从而导致了暴力事件的发生。警察随即采取强硬措施，驱散了街上的人群。
