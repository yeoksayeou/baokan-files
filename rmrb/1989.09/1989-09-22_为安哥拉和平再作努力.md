On September 18, the heads of state from eight African countries—Zaire, Angola, Congo, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe—met in Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, to renew efforts for peace in Angola. The meeting reaffirmed the spirit of the agreement reached at the Badolete Peace Conference on June 22 in Zaire and drafted a declaration based on the Badolete Agreement.

According to reports, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko urged all parties involved to avoid setbacks in the reconciliation process in Angola and hoped that the Angolan government and UNITA would seize the opportunity to achieve peace as soon as possible. The meeting reaffirmed its trust in Mobutu as the mediator for peace in Angola and decided that the eight countries would hold another meeting in Congo at an appropriate time.

During the meeting, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was also in Kinshasa, but he refused to attend, instead handing a set of talking points to President Mobutu to read on his behalf. Since Savimbi did not participate in the meeting, the documents agreed upon at this Kinshasa meeting still need to be sent to Savimbi to seek his agreement.

The Kinshasa meeting is a continuation of the efforts by African countries to restore peace in Angola. On May 16, June 22, and August 22, some African countries held meetings in Luanda, Badolete, and Harare, respectively, to discuss the resolution of the peace issue in Angola. The Angolan government and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi reached a ceasefire agreement at the Badolete meeting on June 22. However, shortly after the meeting, the Angolan government and UNITA accused each other of violating the agreement. According to Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio da Silva, UNITA rejected a draft agreement on Angola's peace in August, stating that its content differed from the ceasefire agreement in June. Savimbi vehemently denied the clauses in the Badolete Agreement that stated he had agreed to temporarily "retire" and integrate UNITA's guerrilla forces into the government army during the peace talks. After the Harare meeting reaffirmed the above clauses in the Badolete Agreement on August 22, Savimbi announced the resumption of war with the Angolan government. Since then, the civil war in Angola has shown a trend of escalation.

To achieve a final peaceful resolution to the Angolan problem, in addition to the continuous meetings and consultations held by relevant African countries, the parties involved have also engaged in active diplomatic activities. South African Acting President F.W. de Klerk visited Zaire in late August and discussed the "delicate situation" in Angola with President Mobutu. Later, de Klerk invited Savimbi to visit South Africa, hoping for early peace in Angola. On September 13, the heads of state of Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe visited Portugal, with both countries expressing their willingness to further promote the peaceful resolution of the Angolan issue. On September 17, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that the U.S. government had confidence in Mobutu's mediation but also expressed firm support for UNITA's position and its "national reconciliation goals" and UNITA's demand for "free and fair" elections.

Despite the efforts of relevant African countries to mediate, the differences between the Angolan government and UNITA remain difficult to bridge. The Angolan government accuses the United States and South Africa of continuing to support UNITA's war rather than urging it to respect the Badolete Agreement, and insists that Savimbi must temporarily leave Angola for a period to create conditions for national peace, "because a government cannot have two leaders." Savimbi, on the other hand, insists on direct negotiations with the Angolan government to sign an interim power-sharing agreement, thereby creating conditions for national elections and achieving national reconciliation.

Given the significant differences between Savimbi and the leaders of Angola and the eight African countries, President Mobutu, as the mediator, has been trying to persuade Savimbi to participate in the Kinshasa meeting and shake hands with Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos for the second time, but without success. UNITA has decided to hold its party congress from September 23 to 29 to unify its thoughts and formulate its negotiating position. Notably, on September 16, Savimbi said during his visit to Abidjan that Mobutu's mediation would not succeed because he was biased towards the Angolan government and that another mediator should be sought. It is reported that Savimbi intends to have Côte d'Ivoire President Félix Houphouët-Boigny take a new approach and make new mediation efforts for peace in Angola. It seems that the process of achieving peace in Angola will continue to be bumpy.

    为安哥拉和平再作努力
    李景卫　史非
    9月18日，扎伊尔、安哥拉、刚果、赞比亚、莫桑比克、津巴布韦、加蓬及圣多美和普林西比非洲8国首脑在扎伊尔首都金沙萨会晤，为实现安哥拉国内和平再做努力。会议重申了6月22日在扎伊尔的巴多利特和平会议上达成的协议精神，并根据巴多利特协议起草了一部宣言。
    据报道，扎伊尔总统蒙博托在会议上要求有关方面避免安哥拉和解出现挫折，希望安哥拉政府和安盟抓住机会，早日实现和平。会议重申了对蒙博托作为安哥拉国内和平调解人的信任并决定8国将在适当时间在刚果举行另一次会议。
    会议期间，安盟领导人萨文比也在金沙萨，但他拒绝与会，只是将一个发言要点，交给了蒙博托总统，请他代为宣读。因萨文比未参加会议，此次金沙萨会议达成的文件还需送交萨文比，以求取得一致意见。
    金沙萨会议是非洲国家为恢复安哥拉和平所做努力的继续。5月16日、6月22日和8月22日，一些非洲国家曾就解决安哥拉国内和平问题分别于罗安达、巴多利特和哈拉雷举行过会议。安哥拉政府和安盟领导人萨文比在6月22日的巴多利特会议上达成一项停火协议。但会议之后不久，安哥拉政府与安盟互相指责对方违反了协议。据安哥拉外长范迪嫩透露，安盟8月份已拒绝了关于安哥拉和平的协议草案，称其与6月的停火协议内容有所不同。萨文比“以最激烈的言辞”否认了巴多利特协议中关于他曾同意在和谈期间接受暂时“隐退”和将安盟游击队编入政府军中的条款。在8月22日的哈拉雷会议重申了巴多利特协议中的上述条款后，萨文比宣布恢复同安哥拉政府的战争。自此，安哥拉内战有不断升级的趋向。
    为求得安哥拉问题的最终和平解决，除非洲有关国家不断召开会议磋商对策外，同该问题有关的各方还进行了积极的外交活动。南非代总统德克勒克8月下旬访问了扎伊尔，同蒙博托总统重点讨论了安哥拉“近来微妙的形势”。其后，德克勒克又邀萨文比访问了南非，希望安哥拉国内早日实现和平。9月13日，刚果、圣多美和普林西比国家元首同时访问了葡萄牙，三国均表示愿进一步推动安哥拉问题的和平解决。9月17日，美国国务院在一项声明中说，美国政府对蒙博托的调解有信心，但又表示坚决支持安盟的立场及其“民族和解目标”和安盟要求举行“自由公正”大选的主张。
    尽管非洲有关国家尽力调解，但安哥拉政府和安盟双方的分歧仍然难以弥合。安哥拉政府指责美国和南非仍然支持安盟进行战争而不是促使它尊重巴多利特协议，并坚持萨文比必须暂时离开安哥拉一段时间，以便为国家实现和平创造条件，这是“因为一个政府不能有两位首脑”。萨文比则坚持同安哥拉政府举行直接谈判，以便签订一项临时权力分配协定，并由此创造条件举行全国大选，实现全国和解。
    鉴于萨文比同安哥拉政府及非洲8国领导人的分歧较大，蒙博托总统作为调解人在此次金沙萨会议前一直努力说服萨文比参加会议，同安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯第二次握手，但未能成功。安盟已决定于9月23—29日召开党的代表大会，统一思想，制定谈判立场。值得注意的是，本月16日萨文比在阿比让访问时说，蒙博托的调解不会成功，因为他偏向于安哥拉政府，应当另寻调解人。据报道，萨文比有意让科特迪瓦总统博瓦尼另辟蹊径，并为安哥拉和平做新的调解努力。看来，今后安哥拉国内和平的进程仍将是坎坷不平的。
