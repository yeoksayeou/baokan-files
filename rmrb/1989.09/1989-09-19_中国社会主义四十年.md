On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong raised the first Five-Star Red Flag at Tiananmen Square, solemnly proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China. From that day forward, the Chinese people, standing tall, strode confidently into a new era of historical development.

Over the past forty years, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, relying on the arduous struggle of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, we have overcome numerous difficulties, withstood severe tests, and adhered to the socialist path. The forty years of the People's Republic are forty years of integrating Marxist basic principles with Chinese socialist revolutionary and construction practices, forty years of tremendous changes in the motherland, and forty years of great victories and rich experiences in the cause of Chinese socialism.

A century of history has proven that the capitalist path is not viable in China. Only socialism can save China; this is the great historical choice made by the Chinese people.

After 1840, due to the invasion of imperialism, feudal China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, impoverished, and backward country. The Chinese people fought bravely and unyieldingly for national independence, national liberation, and democracy and freedom.

In the long, troubled years, countless patriots groped in the dark, seeking a path to save the nation and its people from the external world. The reformers who initiated the Hundred Days' Reform hoped to emulate Japan's Meiji Restoration and follow the path of constitutional monarchy. However, they were crushed by the imperialist powers and the feudal regime within a hundred days. The bourgeois democratic revolution led by Sun Yat-sen overthrew the feudal imperial system that had lasted for more than two thousand years. However, the fruits of this revolution were quickly seized by the Beiyang warlords. Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen, aligned with imperialism, and represented the interests of the big landlords and compradors, implementing capitalism for twenty-two years. China did not change its semi-colonial, semi-feudal status, and the people remained in misery. The nearly forty years before the founding of the nation were a history of the failure of the capitalist path in China.

Why did the capitalist path not work in China? Comrade Mao Zedong gave a profound answer to this question half a century ago. From the international perspective, the primary reason is that international capitalism, i.e., imperialism, would not allow it. The history of modern China is a history of imperialist aggression against China, opposing China's independence, and opposing China's development of capitalism. International imperialism would never allow China to become a strong competitor, nor would they allow the loss of such a vast source of raw materials, a market for dumping goods, and a source of cheap labor. They always tried every means to obstruct the development of Chinese national capitalism. From the domestic perspective, China's big bourgeoisie could not survive without relying on international capitalist forces. China's national bourgeoisie, due to the fragility of their economic position and the weakness of their political stance, could not carry out a thorough anti-imperialist, anti-feudal revolution, transforming China into an independent capitalist power.

What is the future and destiny of China? Just as people were confused and bewildered, the October Revolution in Russia brought Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people. It helped the advanced elements of China to observe the fate of the nation with a proletarian worldview and rechoose the path of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, followed the trend of historical development, represented the fundamental interests of the broad masses, and combined the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution, pointing out the path for the Chinese people to advance to socialism through the New Democratic Revolution. Led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party led the people of all ethnic groups in China through twenty-eight years of arduous struggle, finally overthrowing the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieving the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution, establishing the People's Republic of China, and paving the way for the establishment and development of socialism in China.

Only socialism can save China; this is the great historical choice made by the Chinese people after more than a hundred years of tortuous practice.

Forty years of practice have proven that the socialist system has tremendous superiority and strong vitality. Socialism in China has achieved and will continue to achieve great success. Only socialism can develop China.

Forty years ago, when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and the Kuomintang government scattered like birds and beasts, the U.S. State Department and Secretary of State Acheson had mistakenly predicted that the Chinese Communist Party would not be able to solve its economic problems, that China would forever be in chaos, and that China had no way out. Forty years have passed, and China's socialist practice has completely refuted the nonsense of Acheson and his ilk.

The birth of New China marked the beginning of a new stage in our country's society. The Party led the people to establish and consolidate a state power of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, making the people the masters of the new state and new society. This provided the fundamental guarantee for building a socialist modernized country.

The establishment of people's power ended the fragmented situation of old China, achieving the great unity and solidarity that the Chinese people had long dreamed of. The state made every effort to promote the common prosperity of more than fifty ethnic groups, and the relationship of equality, unity, and mutual assistance among ethnic groups has been established.

In the early days of New China, we quickly healed the wounds of war, smoothly completed the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production, and established and developed a socialist economy based on the public ownership of the means of production. Over the past forty years, the economic landscape of our country has undergone a fundamental change, and comprehensive national strength has greatly increased. The cumulative fixed asset investment of the entire people has reached more than 200 billion yuan, and the newly increased fixed assets are equivalent to 126 times the industrial fixed assets accumulated by old China in nearly a hundred years. In 1988, the national income was more than 140 billion yuan, equivalent to 12 times that of the early days of the founding of the nation. The production of some important industrial and agricultural products has rapidly risen in the world rankings, with steel production and electricity generation rising to fourth place, crude oil production rising to fifth place, and the production of grain, cotton, meat, and coal all ranking first in the world.

Agricultural production has made breakthrough progress. In 1988, the total grain output was 2.5 times that of 1949, and despite the continuous increase in population, we have basically solved the problem of feeding 1.1 billion people through our own efforts. The stable growth of agriculture and the improvement of agricultural production conditions have laid the foundation for the long-term stable development of the national economy. This is an internationally recognized remarkable achievement.

We have established an independent and relatively complete socialist modern industrial system on the ruins of old China. While traditional industries have rapidly developed, a number of new high-tech industries such as microelectronics, aerospace, and nuclear industry have also rapidly developed from scratch. The proportion of industry in the total social output value has risen from less than 25% in 1949 to 61%. Under the conditions of weak foundation and heavy internal and external burdens, the industrialization process of our country, which started, has completed in forty years what capitalist countries usually take one or two hundred years to complete.

With the development of the economy, the living standards of the people have significantly improved. In 1988, the actual consumption level of the national population, after deducting the factors of price increases, was 3 times that of the early days of the founding of the nation. The vast majority of people, after solving the problem of subsistence, have begun to transition to a moderately prosperous life, with significant improvements in food, clothing, daily necessities, and housing. This is in stark contrast to the situation before liberation when billions of laboring people were starving and naked.

Socialist democracy and legal system construction have gradually developed, and the basic political system of the state has become increasingly perfect, with a socialist legal system initially formed based on the Constitution. Our country's stable and united political situation has been continuously consolidated and developed in the struggle to overcome various obstacles, and social order and social customs have undergone significant changes.

Education, science, culture, and health undertakings have flourished. Various levels and types of schools have continuously provided the socialist construction cause with millions of professional talents, and a large team of red and expert intellectuals, as the backbone of various fronts, is working hard. Forty years ago, China, which could not even produce a single precision machine tool, has today entered the ranks of the world's advanced countries in high-tech fields such as the launch and recovery of man-made Earth satellites, the development of positron-electron colliders, and the theoretical research of superconducting materials. Medical and social security conditions have greatly improved, mass sports activities have been widely carried out, and the average life expectancy has increased from 35 years before liberation to 69 years. The era of the "Sick Man of Asia" has passed and will not return.

We have defeated the foreign invasion forces that have successively isolated, blockaded, interfered with, sabotaged, and provoked our country, safeguarding the security and independence of the state. Socialist motherland has a revolutionary, modern, and regular national defense force. The test of blood and fire has proven that they are always loyal guardians of socialism. Our country has always adhered to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, playing an increasingly important and positive role in international affairs, and winning the due position and dignity on the ever-changing international stage.

It should be emphasized that the cause of socialist construction in our country started from a situation of desolation and ruin, with everything in disrepair. In just forty years, the economic landscape of our country has undergone tremendous changes. In just forty years, the social changes in our country have been even more profound. The prosperity of the national economy and the overall progress of society mark the rise of socialist China as a giant in the East.

The unprecedented cause of socialism has no successful experience to learn from and no ready-made models to imitate. Due to the lack of experience in building socialism, we have taken detours and made mistakes in practice, failing to achieve the greater successes we should have. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Chinese Communist Party, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core, with the theoretical courage, practical spirit, rich experience, and foresight of Marxism, made the strategic decision to build socialism with Chinese characteristics in construction, reform, and opening up, finding the correct path of building socialism that suits China's national conditions. The ten years of reform and opening up have achieved brilliant achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.

Facts have proven: Socialism in China has achieved and will continue to achieve great success. Only socialism can develop China.

To adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, to adhere to one central task and two basic points, and to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is the enlightenment of forty years of Chinese socialism.

Forty years of Chinese socialism have achieved great victories and also suffered serious difficulties and setbacks. The rich experience accumulated in practice and exploration is our hard-won spiritual wealth. Seriously summarizing and drawing lessons from both positive and negative experiences will make us more mature and more resolute.

Forty years of experience tells us that building socialism must adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts. The modernization of socialism must start from China's national conditions, strictly follow objective laws, and always regard the development of social productive forces as the most fundamental task.

In a country like China, with a large population and a backward economy and culture, building socialism is a new topic in the history of scientific socialism. This determines that we cannot simply copy from books or imitate foreign models but must start from China's national conditions and create a socialist path with Chinese characteristics in practice.

Currently, our country is still in the primary stage of socialism, and the basic national conditions are: the situation of poverty and backwardness has not fundamentally changed; out of 1.1 billion people, 800 million live in rural areas; the per capita share of many natural resources, including arable land, is among the lowest in the world; the development levels of various regions are very unbalanced, etc. Therefore, the socialist modernization construction with economic construction as the center must start from these national conditions, act according to our ability, strive actively, and gradually realize the strategic goal of modernization in steps and stages.

A fundamental task of the socialist stage in our country is to develop productive forces. The superiority of socialism is ultimately reflected in the fact that its productive forces should develop higher and faster than capitalism. In a poor and backward country like ours, how to better develop productive forces is a very important issue. In this regard, we have made beneficial explorations and also paid a huge price.

In the past construction years, there have been several instances of expanding class struggle and the tendency to seek quick results. During the "Cultural Revolution," everything was conducted under the banner of class struggle, and the development of socialist productive forces was wrongly criticized as the so-called "theory of productive forces," leading the national economy to the brink of collapse. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee began to comprehensively correct the "leftist" errors of the "Cultural Revolution" and its predecessors, re-established the principle of seeking truth from facts, and decisively shifted the focus of work to the track of socialist modernization construction with economic construction as the center. It emphasized that China's modernization must start from China's national conditions, thereby injecting vitality and vigor into the cause of Chinese socialism.

Why have such situations that violate objective laws occurred repeatedly? In our work, the main reasons are: insufficient understanding of the contradictions, changes, and laws of socialist society; insufficient recognition of the long-term and arduous nature of socialist construction in our country; sometimes failing to properly adhere to democratic centralism; the lack of institutional and procedural guarantees for the scientific and democratic nature of decision-making; the lack of an effective supervision and restraint mechanism, causing decisions to deviate from national conditions and exceed real possibilities.

Correctly understanding China's national conditions and starting from reality is the primary issue in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and is the fundamental basis for formulating and implementing correct lines, policies, and principles. Starting from national conditions is the greatest principle of seeking truth from facts and is the overall situation that we must never forget in the process of building socialism. Whether it is the central government or local governments, whether it is prosperous regions or poor regions, whether it is during smooth times or difficult times, we must always remember the overall situation of China's national conditions. Otherwise, we will suffer setbacks.

Forty years of experience tells us that building socialism with Chinese characteristics must correctly handle the dialectical relationship between material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction, and adhere to the two civilizations simultaneously.

Material civilization is the foundation and prerequisite for spiritual civilization, and spiritual civilization is an important guarantee for material civilization construction to maintain the correct direction. The simultaneous development of the two civilizations is a major feature and advantage of our socialist construction, and at no time can we neglect one for the other.

If we emphasize or even distort spiritual civilization construction, neglect material civilization construction, social productive forces will be suppressed or even stagnate, and the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the people will not be met accordingly. During the "Cultural Revolution," due to the neglect of material civilization construction, the denial of people's material interests, and the complete replacement of spiritual civilization construction with completely wrong class struggle, the enthusiasm of the people for socialism was greatly damaged, causing chaos, destruction, and retrogression in the cause of socialism, and widening the gap with capitalist countries that had already narrowed. Similarly, if we focus solely on material civilization construction and relax spiritual civilization construction guided by Marxism, it will blur the common ideals, beliefs, morals, and pursuits, and will disperse the spirit and lose direction. The ideological and cultural front, if the proletariat does not occupy it, bourgeois and other non-proletarian ideologies will inevitably take advantage of the vacuum. The turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that mainly occurred in Beijing in May and June of this year once again proved this point.

The practice of the two civilizations has given us profound enlightenment: in the primary stage of socialism, the opposition between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization is always the focus of struggle in the political and ideological fields, and we must take the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles as the core of spiritual civilization construction; we must place the two civilizations in equally important strategic positions and never treat material civilization construction as a hard task while treating spiritual civilization construction as a soft indicator; spiritual civilization construction is a major issue related to the rise and fall of the cause of socialism, and we must strive for effectiveness, both avoiding formalism and not adopting a utilitarian attitude.

Socialist spiritual civilization construction requires cultivating and nurturing a batch after batch of socialist new people who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. Currently, we must especially emphasize the consistent implementation of the basic line of "one center, two basic points"; systematically and persuasively carry out education on patriotism, socialism, collectivism, hard work, and law-abiding; oppose extreme individualism, money worship, anarchism, worship of foreign things, and various decadent and backward bad tendencies, and improve people's spiritual outlook.

Forty years of experience tells us that in the process of building socialism, we must take the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country. On the basis of ten years of practice, we must be bolder in reform and opening up.

Socialist society is a society of constant innovation. Reform is the self-improvement of socialist production relations and superstructure, and is the internal driving force for social progress. Today's world is an open world, and no country can achieve development in a closed state. Due to various reasons, the rigid and closed system and concepts that have been formed in our country for a long time have seriously constrained the development of productive forces and shackled the liberation of national spirit. In today's world where the economy and science and technology are developing rapidly and socialism is facing challenges, reform and opening up have become an urgent and popular historical task.

The ten years of reform and opening up are the most vigorous period of economic development, the fastest period of national strength growth, and the period when the people have benefited the most in our country. It is also the period when China has made great strides towards the world and the future. In the past ten years, our national income has doubled, with an average annual growth rate of 9.6%, which is much higher than the average annual growth rate of 6.1% in the previous 26 years; the improvement of urban and rural living standards is unprecedented; a multi-level and targeted opening pattern has initially taken shape.

Our country's practice of reform and opening up has broadened our vision and established new concepts. The choice of the socialist path by the Chinese people is a historical necessity, and the construction of socialism must adhere to reform and opening up, which is also a historical necessity. The socialist system has no necessary connection with the lack of vitality of a closed and rigid system. The socialist system contains broad space for the full development of productive forces, and the deep potential of our country's development of socialist economy has not yet been fully released. The superiority and vitality of the socialist system lie in its great inclusiveness and broad adaptability. It can continuously adjust and improve itself in different stages of social development.

Reform and opening up must adhere to the socialist direction and always adhere to two fundamental principles: one is to adhere to the public ownership of the means of production as the mainstay, and the other is to adhere to the road of common prosperity. Deviating from this direction will lead to the capitalist wrong path.

The road of reform and opening up will not be smooth sailing. The establishment and implementation of the policy of reform and opening up have been achieved in the process of overcoming various ideological obstacles and breaking through various obstacles. In the process of reform and opening up, it is inevitable to encounter various mistakes, and it will be difficult to completely avoid them in the future. Attributing some negative phenomena in current social life to reform and opening up is not in line with objective reality. We must fully recognize the long-term and complex nature of reform and opening up and cannot be impatient for quick results. We must correctly handle the pros and cons of reform and opening up and cannot stop because of minor setbacks. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, be bolder in reform, and be bolder in opening up.

Forty years of experience tells us that only by maintaining the stability and unity of the state, can we continuously promote the construction of socialist democratic politics, and only then can we fully open up a new situation in the construction of socialism.

The cause of socialism is the cause of thousands and millions of people. Fully mobilizing and giving full play to the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the people is the hope and strength of the cause of socialism. The essence and core of socialist democratic politics are to carry forward people's democracy, ensure that all the people are masters of the country, and manage national economic, cultural, and social affairs by law. The democracy that our people enjoy is broad and genuine, which is fundamentally different from bourgeois democracy.

Building socialist democratic politics is one of the fundamental tasks and goals of our Party, and it is also an important guarantee for maintaining the stability and unity of the state and the smooth progress of the modernization construction cause. Consolidating and developing the political situation of stability and unity is the highest interest of the state and the people. Without stability and unity, there is no socialism, no socialist modernization, and no construction of socialist democratic politics. Practice has proven that whenever so-called "big democracy" is advocated, whenever political turmoil occurs, the stability and unity of the state will inevitably be seriously damaged, and the achievements of the cause of socialism that have been achieved will face the danger of being in vain.

The construction of socialist democratic politics in the current stage must focus on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people and strive to improve the basic system. We must continue to improve the system of people's congresses, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and strengthen various grassroots democratic systems. While developing socialist democracy, we must improve the socialist legal system, so that our socialist democratic politics can gradually move towards institutionalization and legalization. Due to the deep influence of feudal traditions left by history, the lack of democratic traditions, and the restrictions of various factors such as social, economic, and cultural development levels, the construction of socialist democratic politics can only be carried out in an orderly and step-by-step manner. The construction of democratic politics must adapt to the requirements of the socialist economic base, neither lagging behind nor being too far ahead. Through the joint efforts of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, we will definitely create a higher and more practical democracy than that of the West.

The cause of socialism in our country is in a critical period of development. Challenges and opportunities coexist, and difficulties and hopes coexist. We must see the situation clearly, seize the opportunity, overcome all difficulties, and strive for greater victories.

We must be soberly aware that the original economic and cultural foundation of our country is relatively poor, and the time wasted in the past is too much, so many aspects of backwardness cannot be fundamentally changed in the short term.

We have not yet fully understood the laws of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and are still in the process of exploring from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom; at the same time, many new situations and problems will arise in the march towards the Four Modernizations, waiting for us to solve.

Today, international competition is becoming increasingly fierce. To welcome the arrival of the new century, every country is speeding up the formulation of development strategies to enhance comprehensive national strength. In the last ten years of this century, our country will face the most critical step in implementing the development strategy, and the international competition will be even more intense.

We must also be aware that our modernization construction and reform and opening up are being carried out in a complex international environment, and we must be vigilant and oppose the "peaceful evolution" of imperialism, which will be a long-term struggle.

For the Chinese people, who have been tempered and are not willing to be inferior, challenges are also opportunities. We must arouse revolutionary spirit and bravely face the challenges. All views of inaction, self-deprecation, and seeking only benefits without contribution are the views of cowards and lazy people.

We must see that history has not only given us the great mission of building a socialist power but also provided us with sufficient favorable conditions to achieve new victories.

Currently, the international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation, from confrontation to dialogue, and peace and development have become the two major themes of the world. This will enable us to strive for a relatively long period of international peace environment for the modernization construction of our socialist motherland.

The forty years of socialist practice in China have accumulated considerable economic and technological strength and accumulated rich experience on both positive and negative sides, laying a solid foundation for the further development of our country.

The line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is a correct line of Marxism and a correct line that is deeply loved by the people. Under the guidance of this line, the socialist road will surely become broader and broader.

The Chinese people, who have experienced many difficulties and twists and turns, eagerly hope for the prosperity and prosperity of the motherland and the happiness and prosperity of the people. "Revitalizing China and realizing the Four Modernizations" concentrates the common aspirations of the people. The "three-step" development strategy of our country formulated by the Party Central Committee has already and will further inspire the great enthusiasm and creativity of hundreds of millions of people to dedicate themselves to the cause of socialism.

The new leadership core of the Party Central Committee produced by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee provides a powerful organizational guarantee for maintaining the continuity of the Party's line and opening up a new situation in the cause of socialism. The construction, reform, and opening up of our country will surely be more stable, faster, and better.

New challenges bring new opportunities and hopes for success, as well as severe competition and great pressure. In times of prosperity, we must not forget the warnings. We must not forget the painful lessons of repeatedly missing opportunities since the founding of the nation. Now, history has once again given us an opportunity. We must wake up, further enhance our sense of mission and urgency, unite as one, and strive to catch up.

The cause of socialism in China is an important part of the cause of human progress. The birth of the People's Republic of China once shocked the world and strengthened the strength of world progress and the influence of Marxism. The success of China's socialist modernization construction will also make new contributions to world peace and the cause of human progress, further enhancing the attractiveness of scientific socialism. The wind will break the waves, and the sails will be hoisted to cross the vast sea. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the unremitting and arduous struggle of the people of the whole country, a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized China will surely stand tall among the nations of the world.

　　中国社会主义四十年
　　任国钧
    1949年10月1日，毛泽东主席在天安门升起第一面五星红旗，庄严宣告中华人民共和国成立。从此，站立起来的中国人民，昂首阔步地跨进了历史发展的新纪元。
    四十年来，在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，依靠全国各族人民的艰苦奋斗，我们战胜了重重困难，经受了严峻考验，坚持了社会主义道路。人民共和国的四十年，是马克思主义基本原理同中国社会主义革命和建设实践相结合的四十年，是祖国发生翻天覆地变化的四十年，是我国社会主义事业取得巨大胜利和丰富经验的四十年。
          百年来的历史证明，资本主义道路在中国走
    不通。只有社会主义才能救中国，这是中国人民
    的伟大的历史性选择
    1840年以后，由于帝国主义的入侵，封建的中国逐渐沦为半殖民地半封建的、贫穷落后的国家。中国人民为国家独立、民族解放和民主自由进行了前仆后继、百折不挠的英勇斗争。
    风雨如晦，鸡鸣不已。在那漫长的忧患岁月里，多少仁人志士在黑暗中痛苦地摸索，试图从外部世界寻找一条救国救民的道路。发动戊戌变法的维新派幻想仿照日本的“明治维新”，走君主立宪的道路，在帝国主义列强和封建政权的夹击下，百日便告夭折。孙中山领导的资产阶级民主革命，推翻了两千多年的封建帝制。但是，这次革命的果实很快被北洋军阀所篡夺。蒋介石背叛了孙中山，依附帝国主义，代表大地主、大买办阶级的利益搞了二十二年资本主义，中国丝毫没有改变半殖民地、半封建国家的面貌，人民仍处于水深火热之中。建国前近四十年的历史，是资本主义道路在中国破产的历史。
    在中国，资本主义道路为什么走不通呢？毛泽东同志早在半个世纪前就作过精辟的回答。从国际环境说，首先是国际资本主义即帝国主义列强不允许。一部中国近代史，就是帝国主义侵略中国，反对中国独立，反对中国发展资本主义的历史。国际帝国主义绝不愿意中国变成与之竞争的强大对手，绝不愿意失去如此巨大的原料产地、商品倾销市场和廉价劳动力的来源，总是千方百计阻遏中国民族资本主义的发展。从国内环境说，中国的大资产阶级除了依附于国际资本主义势力，便不能生存下去。中国的民族资产阶级由于经济地位的脆弱性和政治态度的软弱性，也不可能进行彻底的反帝反封建的革命，把中国变成独立的资本主义强国。
    中国的出路和前途究竟何在？正当人们困惑茫然的时候，俄国十月革命给中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义。它帮助中国的先进分子用无产阶级的宇宙观观察国家命运，重新选择中国的革命道路。中国共产党人顺应历史发展的潮流，代表广大人民的根本利益，把马列主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合起来，为中国人民指明了通过新民主主义革命走向社会主义的道路。以毛泽东同志为领袖的中国共产党领导中国各族人民，经历了二十八年艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山，取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，为社会主义在中国的建立和发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    只有社会主义才能救中国，这是中国人民经过一百多年的曲折实践而作出的伟大的历史性选择。
          四十年的实践证明，社会主义制度具有巨大的优越性和强大的
    生命力。社会主义在中国已经并将继续取得巨大成功，只有社会主
      义才能发展中国
    四十年前，当人民解放军横渡长江，国民党政府如鸟兽散的时候，美国国务院和国务卿艾奇逊曾经臆断，中国共产党解决不了自己的经济问题，中国将永远是天下大乱，中国是毫无出路的。四十年过去了，中国的社会主义实践彻底粉碎了艾奇逊之流的谰言。
    新中国的诞生，标志着我国社会进入了一个崭新的阶段。党领导人民建立和巩固了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家政权，人民成为新国家、新社会的主人。这就为建设社会主义现代化国家提供了根本的保证。
    人民政权的建立，结束了旧中国四分五裂的局面，实现了中国人民梦寐以求的大统一和大团结。国家尽一切努力促进五十多个民族的共同繁荣，平等、团结、互助的民族关系已经确立。
    新中国建立初期，我们迅速治愈了战争创伤，顺利地完成了生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，建立和发展了以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义经济。四十年间，我国的经济面貌根本改观，综合国力大大增强。全民所有制固定资产投资累计达二万多亿元，新增固定资产相当于旧中国近百年积累起来的工业固定资产的126倍。1988年国民生产总值达一万四千多亿元，相当于建国初期的12倍。一些重要工农业产品产量占世界的位次迅速提高，钢产量和发电量上升到第四位，原油产量上升到第五位，谷物、棉花、肉类和煤的产量都已跃居世界首位。
    农业生产取得了突破性进展。1988年粮食总产量比1949年增长了两倍半，在人口不断膨胀的情况下，依靠自己的力量基本上解决了11亿人口的温饱问题。农业的稳定增长和农业生产条件的改善，为国民经济长期稳定发展奠定了基础。这是国际公认的一个了不起的成就。
    我们在旧中国的烂摊子上建立起独立的相当完整的社会主义现代工业体系。在传统工业迅速发展的同时，微电子工业、航天工业、核工业等一大批新兴高技术工业也从无到有迅速发展起来。工业在社会总产值中的比重已由1949年的不到25％上升到61％。在基础薄弱、承受内外重负的情况下开始的我国工业化进程，只用了四十年就走完了资本主义国家通常要一、二百年才能走完的路程。
    随着经济的发展，人民的生活水平显著提高。1988年全国居民实际消费水平，扣除物价上涨因素，比建国初期提高了3倍。绝大多数人在解决温饱问题之后，开始向小康型生活过渡，吃、穿、用、住全面改善。这与解放前亿万劳动人民食不果腹、衣不蔽体的情景形成了鲜明对照。
    社会主义民主与法制建设逐步发展，国家的基本政治制度日趋完善，以宪法为基础的社会主义法律体系初步形成。我国安定团结的政治局面在排除种种障碍的斗争中不断得到巩固和发展，社会秩序和社会风尚明显转变。
    教育、科学、文化、卫生事业蓬勃发展。各级各类学校源源不断地为社会主义建设事业输送了上千万专业人才，一支宏大的又红又专的知识分子队伍作为各条战线的骨干正在辛劳奉献。四十年前连一台精密机床都不能制造的中国，今天在人造地球卫星发射回收、正负电子对撞机研制、超导材料的理论研究等高科技领域跨入世界先进行列。医疗、社会保障条件大为改善，群众性的体育活动广泛开展，人民的平均寿命已从解放前的35岁提高到69岁，“东亚病夫”的时代已经一去不再复返。
    我们战胜了外国侵略势力先后对我国进行的孤立、封锁、干涉、破坏和挑衅，维护了国家的安全和独立。社会主义祖国已经拥有一支革命化、现代化、正规化的国防力量，血与火的考验证明，他们永远是社会主义的忠诚卫士。我国一贯奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，在国际事务中发挥着越来越重大的积极作用，在风云变幻的国际舞台上赢得了应有的地位和尊严。
    需要强调指出的是，我国的社会主义建设事业是在满目疮痍、百废待举的基础上起步的。短短四十年中，我国经济面貌大为改观。短短四十年中，我国发生的社会变革更为深刻。国家经济的繁荣和社会的全面进步，标志着社会主义中国作为东方巨人正在崛起。
    前无古人的社会主义事业，既没有成功的经验可以借鉴，也没有现成的模式可供仿效。由于建设社会主义的经验不多，我们在实践中走过弯路，有过失误，使得我们没有取得本来应该取得的更大成就。党的十一届三中全会以来，以邓小平同志为核心的中国共产党，以马克思主义的理论勇气、求实精神、丰富经验和远见卓识，作出了在建设、改革、开放中，建设有中国特色的社会主义的战略决策，找到了符合中国国情的建设社会主义的正确道路。十年的改革开放取得了举世瞩目的光辉成就。
    事实雄辩地证明：社会主义在中国已经并将继续取得巨大成功。只有社会主义才能发展中国。
        坚持实事求是的思想路线，坚持一个中心
    两个基本点，建设有中国特色的社会主义。这
    是中国社会主义四十年给我们的启示
    中国社会主义四十年取得了伟大的胜利，也遭受过严重的困难和挫折。在实践和探索中所积累的丰富经验，是我们得来不易的精神财富。认真总结和汲取正反两方面的经验，将使我们变得更加成熟，更加坚定。
    四十年的经验告诉我们，建设社会主义必须坚持实事求是的思想路线。社会主义现代化建设一定要从中国国情出发，严格按照客观规律办事，始终把发展社会生产力作为一项最根本的任务。
    在中国这样一个人口众多、经济文化落后的国家建设社会
  主义，是科学社会主义发展史上的新课题。这就决定了我们既不能照抄书本，也不能照搬外国模式，必须从中国的国情出发，在实践中开创有中国特色的社会主义道路。
      目前，我国尚处在社会主义初级阶段，面临的基本国情是：
  贫穷落后的状况至今仍未根本改变；十一亿人口中有八亿居住在农村；包括耕地在内的许多自然资源的人均占有量在世界各
  国中居于后列；各地区之间发展水平很不平衡等等。因此，以
  经济建设为中心的社会主义现代化建设必须从这种国情出发，
  量力而行，积极奋斗，有步骤、分阶段地实现现代化的战略目
  标。
      我国社会主义阶段的一个根本任务是发展生产力。社会主
  义的优越性最终体现在它的生产力要比资本主义发展得更高更
  快一些。在我们这样一个贫穷落后的国家，怎样更好地发展生产力，很重要的一条，就是要从本国国情出发。在这个问题上，我们作过有益探索，也付出过巨大代价。
    在过去的建设年代，曾经几度发生阶级斗争扩大化和急于求成的倾向。在“文化大革命”中，一切“以阶级斗争为纲”，把发展社会主义生产力当作所谓的“唯生产力论”错误地加以批判，导致国民经济濒临崩溃的边缘。党的十一届三中全会开始全面纠正“文化大革命”及其以前的“左”倾错误，重新确立了实事求是的思想路线，果断地把工作重点转移到以经济建设为中心的社会主义现代化建设轨道上来，强调中国的现代化必须从中国的国情出发，从而使我国的社会主义事业充满了生机和活力。
    为什么一再发生这种违背客观规律的情况呢？就我们的工作来说，主要是因为：对社会主义社会的矛盾、演变及其规律知之不深，对我国社会主义建设的长期性、艰巨性认识不足；有些时候没有很好地坚持民主集中制，决策的科学化、民主化缺乏制度和程序的保证，缺乏有效的监督制约机制，致使决策离开了国情，超越了现实可能。
    正确认识我国国情，一切从实际出发，是建设有中国特色的社会主义的首要问题，是我们制定和执行正确的路线、方针和政策的根本依据。一切从国情出发，是最大的实事求是，是我们在建设社会主义过程中须臾不可忘记的全局。不论是中央还是地方，不论是富裕地区还是贫困地区，不论是顺利时期还是困难时期，都要牢记中国国情这个全局。否则，就要受到挫折。
    四十年的经验告诉我们，建设具有中国特色的社会主义，必须正确处理物质文明建设与精神文明建设的辩证关系，坚持两个文明一起抓。
    物质文明是精神文明的基础和前提，精神文明是物质文明建设坚持正确方向的重要保证。两个文明并举，是我国社会主义建设的一大特色和优势，任何时候都不可顾此失彼。
    片面强调甚至曲解精神文明建设，忽视物质文明建设，社会生产力就会受到抑制甚至萎缩，人民不断增长的物质文化需要就不能得到相应的满足。“文化大革命”期间，由于忽视物质文明建设，否认人们的物质利益，用完全错误的阶级斗争取代精神文明建设，极大地挫伤了人民群众的社会主义积极性，造成了社会主义事业的混乱、破坏和倒退，使我国同资本主义国家本来已经缩小的差距又拉大了。同样，一味偏重于物质文明建设，放松以马克思主义为指导的精神文明建设，就会模糊共同的理想、信念、道德和追求，就会涣散精神、迷失方向。思想意识阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级和其它非无产阶级思想必然趁虚而入。今年五、六月间主要发生在北京的动乱和反革命暴乱，又一次证明了这一点。
    两个文明建设的实践给我们以深刻的启示：在社会主义初级阶段，四项基本原则同资产阶级自由化的对立，始终是政治思想领域斗争的焦点，必须把坚持四项基本原则作为精神文明建设的核心；要坚持把两个文明建设摆在同等重要的战略位置，绝不能把物质文明建设当作硬任务，而把精神文明建设当作软指标；精神文明建设是关系社会主义事业兴衰成败的大事，必须讲求实效，既要克服形式主义，更不能采取实用主义的态度。
    社会主义精神文明建设，要求培养造就出一批又一批有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人。当前要特别强调一以贯之地进行“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线教育；系统地、有说服力地开展爱国主义、社会主义、集体主义、艰苦奋斗和遵纪守法的教育；反对极端个人主义、拜金主义、无政府主义、崇洋媚外的思想和各种腐朽没落的不良风气，使人们的精神面貌进一步改观。
     四十年的经验告诉我们，在建设社会主义的过程中，必须走改革开放的强国之路。在十年实践的基础上，更大胆地改革，更大胆地开放。
    社会主义社会是一个不断创新的社会。改革是社会主义生产关系和上层建筑的自我完善，是推动社会前进的内在动力。当今世界是开放的世界，任何一个国家都不可能在封闭状态下求得发展。由于种种原因，我国长期形成的僵化封闭的体制和观念曾经严重束缚了生产力的发展，禁锢了民族精神的解放。在世界经济和科学技术飞速发展、社会主义面临挑战的今天，改革开放已成为一项紧迫的深得人心的历史任务。
    改革开放的十年，是我国经济发展最旺盛、国力增长最快、人民得到实惠最多的时期，是中国大踏步地走向世界、走向未来的时期。十年来，我国国民生产总值增长了一倍半，平均每年递增9.6％，大大高于前26年平均每年增长6.1％的速度；城乡居民生活改善之快前所未有；一个多层次、有重点的开放格局初步形成。
    我国改革开放的实践，使我们拓宽了视野，树立了新的观念。中国人民选择社会主义道路是历史的必然，建设社会主义要坚持改革开放也是历史的必然。社会主义制度与缺乏活力的封闭僵化体制没有必然联系。社会主义制度蕴涵着生产力充分发展的广阔空间，我国发展社会主义经济的深厚潜力，还远未发挥出来。社会主义制度的优越性和生命力就在于，它具有巨大的包容性和广泛的适应性，它能够在社会发展的不同阶段不断进行自我调整和自我完善。
    改革开放必须坚持社会主义方向，要始终坚持两条根本原则：一是坚持社会主义公有制占主体，一是坚持共同富裕的道路。偏离这个方向，就会走到资本主义邪路上去。
    改革开放的道路不会一帆风顺。改革开放方针的确立和贯彻，是在不断排除各种思想障碍和冲破各种阻力中实现的。在改革开放中不可避免会出现这样那样的失误，今后也难以完全避免。把当前社会生活中出现的某些消极现象归咎于改革开放，是不符合客观实际的。我们要充分认识改革开放的长期性、复杂性，不能急于求成。我们要正确对待改革开放中的利弊得失，不能因噎废食。我们要坚决贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，更大胆地改革，更大胆地开放。
  四十年的经验告诉我们，只有在维护国家安定团结的大前提下，不断推进社会主义民主政治建设，才有可能全面开创社会主义建设的新局面。
    社会主义事业是千百万人的事业。充分调动和发挥人民群众的积极性、主动性和创造性，是社会主义事业希望和力量之所在。社会主义民主政治的本质和核心就是发扬人民民主，保证全体人民当家作主，依法管理国家经济、文化和社会事务。我国人民享有的民主是广泛的、真实的，这同资产阶级民主有着本质的区别。
    建设社会主义民主政治，是我们党的根本任务和奋斗目标之一，也是维护国家安定团结、推进现代化建设事业顺利进行的重要保障。巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面是国家和人民的最高利益。没有安定团结就没有社会主义，就没有社会主义现代化，也就没有社会主义民主政治建设。实践证明，凡是搞所谓“大民主”的时候，凡是发生政治动乱的时候，国家的安定团结必然遭到严重破坏，社会主义事业不但无法前进，已经取得的成果也会面临付诸东流的危险。
    现阶段社会主义民主政治的建设，必须着眼于调动人民群众的积极性，致力于基本制度的完善。要继续完善人民代表大会制度、共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，不断加强各种基层民主制度。在发展社会主义民主的同时，必须健全社会主义法制，使我国社会主义民主政治逐步走向制度化、法律化。由于历史遗留给我们的封建传统很深，民主传统较少，又受到社会、经济、文化发展水平等多种因素的限制，所以社会主义民主政治建设只能有秩序有步骤地进行。民主政治建设必须适应社会主义经济基础的要求，既不能滞后，也不能超前。经过全党全国人民的共同努力，我们一定能够创造出比西方更高、更切实的民主。
    我国的社会主义事业正处在关键的发展时期，挑战与机遇同在，困难和希望并存。在党的领导下，我们一定能够实现宏伟的战略目标
    我国的社会主义事业正处在一个关键的发展时期。挑战与机遇同在，困难和希望并存。我们要认清形势，把握时机，排除万难，去争取更大的胜利。
    要清醒地看到，我国原来的经济文化基础较差，过去耽误的时间又太多，许多方面的落后状况短期内还不可能根本改变。
    我们对建设具有中国特色的社会主义的规律还没有完全认识，还处于由必然王国到自由王国的探索之中；同时，在实现四化的征途中，将出现许多新情况、新问题，有待我们去解决。
    当今国际竞争日益加剧。为了迎接新世纪的到来，各国都在加紧制定增强综合国力的发展战略。在本世纪的最后十年中，我国要实现发展战略的最关键的一步，面临的国际竞争会更加激烈。
    还必须看到，我们的现代化建设和改革开放是在复杂的国际环境中进行的，警惕和反对帝国主义的“和平演变”将是一场长期的斗争。
    对于饱经磨砺、不甘自馁的中国人民来说，挑战也是一种机遇。我们必须振奋革命精神，勇敢地迎接挑战。一切无所作为的观点，妄自菲薄的观点，只图索取、不讲奉献的观点，都是懦夫懒汉的观点。
    应当看到，历史既赋予了我们建设社会主义强国的重大使命，也为我们争取新胜利提供了充分有利的条件。
    当前国际局势从紧张趋向缓和，由对抗转向对话，和平与发展已成为世界的两大主题。这就有可能为我国的社会主义现代化建设争取到一个较长时间的国际和平环境。
    社会主义在中国四十年的实践，已经积聚了相当雄厚的经济技术实力，积累了正反两方面的丰富经验，为我国的进一步发展打下了坚实基础。
    党的十一届三中全会以来的路线，是一条马克思主义的正
  确路线，是一条深得人心的正确路线。在这条路线指引下，社会主义道路必将越走越宽广。
      历尽艰难曲折的中国各族人民热切期望祖国繁荣昌盛、人民富裕幸福。“振兴中华，实现四化”集中反映了他们的共同意愿。党中央制定的我国发展战略的“三步曲”，已经并将进一步激发亿万人民献身社会主义事业的巨大热情和创造精神。
    党的十三届四中全会产生的新的党中央领导核心，为保持党的路线的连续性，为开创社会主义事业的新局面，提供了有力的组织保证。我国的建设、改革、开放必将进行得更稳、更快、更好。
    新的挑战孕育着新的机遇和成功的希望，也包含着严峻的竞争和巨大的压力。盛世不忘危言，我们切不可忘记建国以来一再错失良机的痛切教训。现在，历史又一次为我们提供了机会。我们必须警醒起来，进一步增强使命感和紧迫感，团结一致，奋起直追。
    中国的社会主义事业是人类进步事业的重要组成部分。中华人民共和国的诞生曾经震撼世界，增强了世界进步力量和马克思主义的影响。中国社会主义现代化建设的成功，也必将对世界和平和人类进步事业作出新的贡献，进一步增强科学社会主义的吸引力。长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。在中国共产党的领导下，经过全国人民锲而不舍的艰苦奋斗，一个富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化中国，必将屹立于世界民族之林。
