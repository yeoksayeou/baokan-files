The 1989 financial, tax, and price inspection has begun. This is a major measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and to carry out rectification and rectification. All levels of leadership must follow the deployment and requirements of the State Council and strive to do a good job in this year's inspection work.

In recent years, especially last year's financial, tax, and price inspection, significant achievements have been made. However, many units still have serious problems in violating financial and economic disciplines. The main manifestations are that various illegal and disorderly acts are increasing rather than decreasing, the amounts involved are getting larger, the circumstances are getting worse, and the phenomena of disobeying orders, not stopping when prohibited, and repeatedly committing offenses are prominent. The reasons for this situation, apart from some institutions, groups, and enterprises and institutions having weak awareness of laws and disciplines, are mainly that various levels of leadership have insufficient understanding of the significance of the inspection, and do not strictly handle various illegal and disorderly acts, making some units regard tax evasion, cost inflation, withholding state revenue, market price manipulation, and wasteful spending as common practices, and even daring to do so, imitating each other, and saying things like "if you don't take it, you lose it," "if you don't occupy it, you lose it," "if it's found, it's yours; if it's not found, it's mine," and so on. The existence of such extremely abnormal phenomena seriously damages the interests of the state and the people, exacerbates social inequality, disrupts the market, and has aroused indignation from all sectors of society. This should be highly regarded.

Conducting a good inspection this year is of great significance to the overall situation. From January to July this year, China's economic situation has shown signs of improvement, with a bumper harvest of summer grain, good growth of autumn crops, stable industrial production, gradually falling market price increases, and relatively good currency recovery. However, it should also be noted that we still face many difficulties. In the first seven months, the growth of national fiscal revenue was slow, fiscal expenditure remained high, and the economic losses caused by the previous period of turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots made it difficult to complete this year's fiscal budget tasks. At the same time, the rate of market price increases is still too high, the growth rate of consumption funds is still higher than the growth rate of production, national income, and fiscal revenue, and the problems of high social consumption and unequal distribution have not been fundamentally alleviated. Through this inspection, the money that should be collected will be collected, and the expenditure that should be reduced will be reduced, which can reduce the economic losses caused by turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots and increase national fiscal revenue; through the inspection, the phenomena of arbitrary price increases, arbitrary price mark-ups, and arbitrary charges will be curbed, which is conducive to enhancing people's confidence in carrying out rectification and rectification, stabilizing the situation, and promoting the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the economy. Through the strict punishment of various illegal and disorderly acts, it can also help people develop the habit of abiding by laws and disciplines, reduce illegal and disorderly acts, curb the spread of corruption, promote clean governance, and establish a new style of hard work and frugal nation-building among the whole Party and the people of the whole country.

In recent times, under the advocacy and leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the fight against corruption and the promotion of clean governance have been carried out in many regions and departments, which will give a strong impetus to the inspection work that has just begun. As long as we seriously act according to the spirit of the State Council's notice on carrying out the 1989 financial, tax, and price inspection, this year's inspection will be more in-depth, solid, and effective than in previous years.

    切实搞好财税物价大检查
    本报评论员
    1989年的税收、财务、物价大检查开始了。这是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，搞好治理整顿的一项重大措施。各级领导一定要按照国务院的部署和要求，努力把今年的大检查工作搞好。
    近几年，特别是去年的税收、财务、物价大检查，取得了很大成绩。但是，不少单位违反财经法纪的问题仍然十分严重。主要表现为，各种违法乱纪行为仍然有增无减，违纪的数额越来越大，违纪情节越来越恶劣，有令不行、有禁不止、屡查屡犯的现象十分突出。造成这种状况的原因，除一些机关团体、企事业单位负责人法纪观念不强外，主要是各级领导对大检查的意义认识不足，对各种违法乱纪行为查处不严，使一些单位对偷税漏税、乱挤成本、截留国家收入、哄抬市场物价和挥霍浪费等违纪行为习以为常，甚至有恃无恐，互相仿效，还说什么“不吃白不吃”、“不占白不占”、“查出了是你的，查不出是我的”，等等。这种极不正常的现象的存在，严重损害了国家和群众的利益，加剧了社会分配不公，扰乱了市场，引起了社会各界的义愤。对此，应当引起我们的高度重视。
    搞好今年的大检查，事关全局，意义重大。今年1至7月，我国的经济形势趋于好转，农业夏粮丰收，秋季作物长势良好，工业生产发展平稳，市场物价的涨幅逐步回落，货币回笼的情况也比较好。但也要看到，我们面临的困难还比较多。前7个月全国财政收入增长缓慢，财政支出居高不下，加上前一时期动乱和反革命暴乱造成了经济损失，给完成今年的财政预算任务造成很大困难。与此同时，市场物价上涨幅度仍然过大，消费基金的增长速度仍高于生产发展和国民收入、财政收入的增长速度，社会高消费和分配不公的问题还没有根本缓解。通过这次大检查，把该收的钱收上来，把该压的支出压下去，可以减少动乱、反革命暴乱造成的经济损失，增加国家财政收入；通过大检查，把乱涨价、乱加价、乱收费的现象压下去，有利于增强人们对搞好治理整顿的信心，稳定大局，有利于经济持续、稳定、协调地发展。通过对各种违法乱纪行为的从严惩处，还可以帮助人们养成遵纪守法的习惯，减少违法乱纪行为，抑制腐败现象的滋长、蔓延，促进廉政建设，在全党、全国人民中树立起艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的新风尚。
    近一时期，在党中央、国务院的倡导和带动下，惩治腐败，提倡廉政，许多地区和部门正在努力扭转各种不良风气，这将给刚刚开始的大检查工作以有力推动。只要我们认真按照国务院关于开展1989年税收、财务、物价大检查的通知精神办事，今年的大检查将会比往年搞得更深入、更扎实、更有成效。
