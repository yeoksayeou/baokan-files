Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 13th — (Reporter Tian Bingxin) Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee member and Secretariat member Li Ruihuan emphasized at a meeting on the "yellow" campaign in the coastal provinces that the work of "cleaning up and eradicating pornographic and obscene materials" (the "yellow" campaign) has been fully launched nationwide and must be pushed forward with greater efforts, strengthened leadership, and concrete implementation to deepen the work.

This meeting was held on September 10th and 11th in Guangzhou, following the nationwide telephone conference on the "yellow" campaign on August 24th. It aimed to review the implementation of the campaign in key areas and further push for concrete actions. Leaders from Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan provinces attended the meeting and reported on the progress and plans for the "yellow" campaign. Vice Secretary of the State Council Liu Zhongde, Deputy Minister of Propaganda Li Yan, and Deputy Director of the State Press and Publication Administration Liu Jiao also attended and spoke at the meeting.

Li Ruihuan presided over the meeting and delivered an important speech. When discussing the progress of the nationwide "yellow" campaign, he pointed out that various levels of leadership have paid great attention to this work, with most regions led by party and government officials who have done a lot of work. The general public has unanimously expressed their support and enthusiasm for the campaign, and an initial atmosphere of "cleaning up and eradicating" has been formed. Various regions and departments have a good grasp of the policy boundaries, and the "yellow" campaign is developing healthily with a good momentum. However, this work has just begun, and we should not overestimate the achievements. The urgent task is for all levels of leadership to redouble their efforts, seize the momentum, and implement the work tightly and concretely. The "yellow" campaign is an important task for implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and it is of great significance for opposing bourgeois liberalization, promoting socialist spiritual civilization, and ensuring the healthy development of reform and opening up. We must see it through to the end and achieve tangible results, preventing it from being half-hearted.

Li Ruihuan said that many of our tasks often fail due to lack of concrete implementation. The key to the current "yellow" campaign is to overcome the tendency of some leading cadres to be superficial and strengthen specific guidance. Relevant leaders should go to the front lines of the "yellow" campaign for a thorough inspection, promptly address the problems found, and solve them one by one. We must further mobilize the masses to care about and support this work, and combine it with professional forces to form a strong public opinion that rejects pornography as honorable, indulges in it as shameful, and deals with traffickers as criminals. This will create a situation where pornographic materials are immediately condemned as soon as they appear. Propaganda, culture, publishing, commerce, taxation, public security, customs, border defense, education, and other departments and mass organizations should work together, from a comprehensive perspective, actively and proactively take on responsibilities. All levels of party committees and governments should take the lead and do a good job of organizational coordination.

Li Ruihuan said that the current focus of the "yellow" campaign is to concentrate efforts on solving the "yellow source" problem. Some coastal cities have large-scale smuggling and production of obscene videos and publications, which are sold to inland areas and harm the entire country. These "black strongholds" must be uprooted. Some publishers, printing houses, and bookstores in coastal and inland areas produce and print obscene and vulgar reading materials and yellow videos in large quantities, and have a well-organized underground distribution network. This must be thoroughly rectified, bad books should be confiscated and sealed, publishers and printing houses should be closed, and those responsible should be investigated. Each locality and unit should study and determine their own focus based on their actual situation.

Li Ruihuan required each locality to handle a number of "yellow" cases. Those with typical significance should be handled seriously and publicized extensively to show the determination of the leadership, encourage the masses, and deter criminals. The policy of "confessing and being lenient, resisting and being strict" and "those who repent and make amends will be pardoned, and those who make great contributions will be rewarded" should be seriously implemented. We must resolutely reverse the past tendency of replacing legal punishment with economic penalties and light sentences for serious crimes, and suppress the arrogance of criminals. At the same time, we should treat those who confess and have a good attitude of repentance leniently, give them a way out, and try to educate and save as many people as possible.

Li Ruihuan once again emphasized that while focusing on the "yellow" campaign, we must also promote the arts and activate mass cultural life, using healthy and popular things to occupy the ideological and cultural front. This is an even more arduous task that must be solved with effort. The propaganda and art activities for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation have already been extensively prepared, and it is hoped that they will be even more meticulous and strive to make more people happy and satisfied.

During his stay in Guangdong, Li Ruihuan, accompanied by provincial party committee leaders Lin Ruo and Ye Xuanping, inspected Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen on issues related to the construction of two civilizations. Li Ruihuan said that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Guangdong has changed greatly and developed rapidly, proving that the policy of reform and opening up is completely correct. We emphasize the Four Cardinal Principles and the "yellow" campaign, and crack down on economic crimes, which are beneficial to reform and opening up. Reform and opening up are the trend of history, the wish of the people, and the fundamental way to overcome difficulties and promote modernization. Li Ruihuan also took great interest in visiting the spiritual civilization construction of Nanhuaxi Street in Guangzhou and the miniature scenic area of Huaxia City in Shenzhen. He pointed out that in areas of opening up to the outside world, special attention should be paid to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Improving the quality of the people and carrying forward national culture can not only resist the impact of obscene and vulgar things but also help create a good social environment to ensure the healthy development of reform and opening up.

　　“扫黄”要突出重点狠抓落实
　　当前必须乘势而上加强领导集中力量解决“黄源”问题

    新华社广州9月13日电　（记者田炳信）中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环在南方沿海四省“扫黄”座谈会上强调，“扫黄”工作已在全国范围内全面铺开，必须乘势而上，加强领导，抓紧落实，把工作引向深入。
    这次座谈会是9月10日、11日在广州召开的，是8月24日全国“扫黄”电话会议以后，检查重点地区的贯彻情况，进一步狠抓落实的工作会议。参加座谈会的广东、福建、浙江、海南省的负责人介绍了“扫黄”工作的情况和打算，国务院副秘书长、全国整顿清理书报刊及录像市场领导小组组长刘忠德、中央宣传部副部长李彦、国家新闻出版署副署长刘杲出席座谈会并发了言。
    李瑞环主持座谈会并在会上作了重要讲话。在谈到全国“扫黄”工作进展情况时，他指出：各级领导对这项工作都很重视，大多数地区都由党政负责同志亲自挂帅，做了大量的工作。广大群众一致表示坚决拥护与热烈支持，已初步形成了“扫黄”的气候。各地区、各部门对政策界限掌握得比较稳，“扫黄”工作发展健康，势头比较好。但是，这项工作刚刚开始，对成绩不可估计过高。当务之急是，各级领导要再加一把劲，乘势而上，把工作抓紧抓实。“扫黄”是当前贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神的一项重要任务，对于反对资产阶级自由化，搞好社会主义精神文明建设，以及保证改革开放的健康发展，都具有重要的意义。我们一定要一抓到底，取得实效，防止半途而废。
    李瑞环说，我们的许多事情常常是失之于抓得不实。当前
  “扫黄”的关键，是克服某些领导干部的飘浮作风，加强具体指导。有关领导同志要深入“扫黄”第一线，进行一次认真的检查，对发现的问题及时采取措施，一件件地加以解决。要进一步发动群众关心、支持这项工作，并与专门力量结合起来，形成拒黄光荣、嗜黄可耻、贩黄有罪的强大社会舆论，造成黄色的东西一露头，就“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的局面。宣传、文化、出版、工商、税务、公安、海关、边防、教育等部门和群众团体要齐心协力，从全局出发，积极主动承担任务。各级党委和政府要统一领导，做好组织协调工作。
    李瑞环说，当前，“扫黄”工作的重点是集中力量解决“黄源”问题。一些沿海地区的城镇，大量走私和制作淫秽录相、书刊，推销到内地，祸害全国，必须下决心拔掉这些“黑据点”。沿海和内地的一些出版社、印刷厂和书商，大量编辑出版、印刷不堪入目的淫秽读物、低级庸俗读物和黄色录相带，并且有一套组织严密的地下发行网络，对此必须彻底加以整顿，坏书要收缴封存，出版社、印刷厂要关闭，责任者要查处。各地各单位都要结合实际，研究确定自己的重点。
    李瑞环要求各地要抓一批“扫黄”案例。对那些具有典型意义的案例要抓紧严肃处理，并大张旗鼓地加以宣传，以显示领导的决心，鼓舞群众，震慑坏人。要认真贯彻党的“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”和“立功者赎罪，立大功者受奖”的政策，既要坚决扭转过去那种以经济处罚代替法律惩办和重罪轻判的偏向，把犯罪分子的嚣张气焰打下去；又要对那些坦白自首、认罪态度较好的人从宽处理，给以出路，尽可能地教育和挽救更多的人。
    李瑞环再次强调，在狠抓“扫黄”的同时，要抓好繁荣文艺和活跃群众文化生活，用健康的、群众喜闻乐见的东西来占领群众思想文化阵地。这是更加繁重的任务，必须下力量认真解决好。国庆40周年的宣传和文艺活动，各地已做了大量工作，希望精心再精心，力争使更多的群众高兴、满意。
    在广东期间，李瑞环还分别由林若、叶选平等省委负责同志陪同，到广州、佛山、中山、珠海、深圳等地就两个文明建设问题进行了考察。李瑞环说，党的十一届三中全会以来，广东变化很大，发展很快，证明了改革、开放的方针是完全正确的。我们讲坚持四项基本原则，强调“扫黄”，打击经济犯罪，是有利于改革开放的，改革开放是历史的趋势，人民的愿望，也是克服困难、推进现代化建设的根本出路。李瑞环还饶有兴趣地参观了广州南华西街精神文明建设和深圳华侨城锦绣中华微缩景区。他指出，对外开放地区，特别要注意抓好社会主义精神文明建设。提高人民素质，弘扬民族文化，不仅能够抵制淫秽、低级庸俗东西的冲击，而且有助于创造一个良好的社会环境，保证改革、开放的健康发展。
