The issue of China's population is a major topic. Observing and studying the formation, distribution, and development trends of the population from historical and contemporary perspectives can help better control the population and develop the economy.

As early as the Shang Dynasty, to defend against invasions by other tribes and natural disasters, our ancestors moved their capital several times, finally stabilizing in the area around Anyang, Henan. Therefore, the population was mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. By the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, most of China was still sparsely populated, and by the end of the Western Han Dynasty, the main population distribution was still in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River.

In the late Western Han period, wars were frequent, and society was in turmoil, causing some northerners to migrate south, reducing the population in the Yellow River basin from 80% of the national total to 60%, marking the first major population migration in history.

After the Tang Dynasty, due to the "An Lushan Rebellion" and the fragmentation of the country into warlord-controlled regions, the central plains suffered from constant warfare, becoming desolate for thousands of miles. Meanwhile, the economy in the south of the Yangtze River was relatively prosperous, and life was more stable. Therefore, for the first time, the population in the south exceeded that in the north, and the population center began to shift southward.

In the late Northern Song Dynasty, the Jin people invaded from the north, and wars broke out frequently. Coupled with severe natural disasters, the social economy in the north suffered serious damage and a large number of people died. Large numbers of refugees fled to the Yangtze River basin, marking the second major population migration in history.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the population in the Yangtze River basin gradually increased. The invasion of capitalism, economic development, and the southward shift of the political center during the Republic of China further concentrated the population in the south, forming the current population distribution pattern of more people in the south and fewer in the north.

Since liberation, although we have actively worked to reduce the imbalance in productivity between regions and to address the national imbalance between population and economy, and conducted large-scale population migrations, the problem has not been fundamentally solved. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the pace of reform in coastal and inland areas was faster than in remote regions. With the hope of increasing income, many people moved to economically active areas. This further exacerbated the already uneven population distribution.

　　华夏人口的历史迁移
    中国人口问题是一个重大课题。从历史与现实的角度观察、研究人口的形成、分布以及发展趋向，有助于更好地控制人口和发展经济。
    早在商王朝时期，为了防御其他氏族部落的侵袭和自然灾害的威胁，先祖们曾几次迁都，最后在河南安阳附近稳定下来。因此，人口分布主要在黄河中下游。到春秋战国时期，我国绝大多数地区依旧是地广人稀，直到西汉末年，人口分布的主要位置仍是在黄河中下游一带。
    西汉后期，战争连年不断，社会急剧动荡，造成了部分北方人南迁，使黄河流域的人口由占全国80％下降到了60％，形成了历史上的第一次人口大迁移。
    到唐王朝以后，由于“安史之乱”和藩镇割据的局面，中原地区连遭战乱，千里萧条。与此同时，长江以南的经济却相对繁荣，生活也较为安定。因此，首次出现了南方人口超过北方人口的现象，全国人口的中心逐渐开始向南转移。
    北宋末年金人南下，战火频起。加上严重的自然灾害，使北方地区的社会经济遭受了严重的破坏和人口大量死亡。大批的难民向长江流域一带逃亡，形成了历史上的第二次人口大迁移。
    明、清以后，长江流域的人口逐步增加，资本主义的入侵和经济发展以及民国以后的政治中心南移，进一步使人口相对地集中到南方，形成了今天这样一个南多北少的人口布局。
    解放以来，尽管我们本着缩小各地区生产力之间的不平衡，为解决人口和经济这两方面的全国性不平衡做了积极努力，进行了大规模的人口迁移，但终究未能从根本上解决问题。党的十一届三中全会以后，沿海和内地改革步伐快于边远地区。抱着提高经济收入等愿望，许多人向经济活跃地区靠拢。这样一来，使本来就不平均的人口分布更趋于不平衡。（1989年第15期《经济工作通讯》刘利民文）
