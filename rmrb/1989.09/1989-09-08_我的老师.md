My Teachers

	In 1966, I had not yet started school. One day, I followed others to a primary school and saw a few people "sitting on airplanes" on the stage. That was the first memory I have of a teacher.

	Later, I went to that school with a schoolbag. On the first day, the class teacher held up a pencil case and said, "You should put two pencils inside." Pencils and pencil cases have gone through several generations, and the teacher has long retired. One day, I met her on the street, but she did not greet me warmly as before. Her face showed a hint of confusion, obviously she had forgotten who I was. At that time, I was studying at Beijing Normal University, and I immediately realized that in the future, I too would have many students whose names I could no longer recall.

	After graduation, I did not become a teacher but continued my studies. Many of my students are now scattered, but our fate remains the same. At the beginning of the year, my senior sister came to Beijing, and we gathered at the professor's home. That day was February 28. The next morning, I hurried to work, and the professor's wife had already prepared breakfast. The professor hastily handed me a copy of his new book. It was only after I got home that I realized the professor had dated it February 29. The year 1989 had only 28 days in February. On a nonexistent day, I received a real book.

	Whether teachers remember their students or not, students will never forget their teachers, even if it is just for themselves.

	In the third grade, my class teacher wore two small braids and loved to recite. Although the texts at that time were simple, like "Listen to the sound of battle from the training ground," she still called us up one by one to correct our intonation carefully. Fortunately, I was considered good at "killing," and the teacher gave me special training. From then on, I often stood on the stage and spoke passionately about criticizing Lin Biao and Confucius, and criticizing the sanctity of teachers. However, my university classmates later said that what I recited best was not related to "killing" but the poems of Xu Zhimo. Last year, I did the narration for a short film. I firmly believe that without the teacher who wore small braids, I would not have sat in front of the microphone in the recording studio. However, I cannot invite the teacher to watch the film. It is said that many years ago, on a certain night, she felt stomach pain and was sent to the hospital on a stretcher, but the doctors could not diagnose the illness, and she died of pain that very night. We, a few students, discussed going to see her descendants, but we heard that she had no children.

	My Chinese teacher in the second year of high school was a senior teacher. Surprisingly, I heard that he had studied commerce in the old society. Only then did I realize that reciting the Three Character Classic and other classical texts from a young age had these benefits. By then, the Cultural Revolution had ended, and the teacher taught us many classical texts, such as "Sacrificial Rite for the Twelfth Brother" and "Petition to Remain in Office." From then on, Chinese essays won over Chinese novels in my heart. After entering university, I eagerly sought out essays to read, and when writing papers, I often received comments: "Language is poor." Even after graduation, when I went to say goodbye to the teacher, the teacher still worriedly said, "Your language is not suitable for academic papers, but it is good for writing essays. You should also practice writing academic papers."

	Because the major I studied did not have the authority to grant degrees, I returned to Beijing Normal University and asked the teacher to chair the defense. As soon as I entered the teacher's study, I saw a large iron bathtub in the middle of the room, with a red carp swimming inside. The fish was bought to be eaten, but because it was pretty, the teacher could not bear to kill it, so it was kept. Holding back laughter, I said, "It's not good, there is a carp spirit in the study." The teacher said the fish was a bit like a person. At first, it always jumped out of the tub, so a screen had to be set up around it. Later, it got used to it, and after removing the screen, it no longer jumped out.

	People are not all like this. For example, one of our female teachers spoke passionately, like someone who only blows the charge. She could not tolerate students being lazy and always encouraged us to jump without hesitation, even if we did not know where the dragon gate was. At that time, graduate students were still rare, and there were many competitors in the exams. During the review, it was inevitable to feel insecure, so I would rush to the female teacher's house. Later, I found out that many classmates also used her house as a refueling station, but I never thought about who would refuel for the teacher. As a student, I thought teachers were all perpetual motion machines.

	It has been several years since I left school, but I have not left my teachers. Occasionally, I send a few manuscripts, and they are still within the teachers' sight. Several professors wrote to encourage me to continue writing, and the husband of the female teacher cut out the articles with scissors. How does the teacher collect them all when he has so many students!

    我的老师
    陆芸芸
    1966年我还没有上学，有一天跟着别人去了小学校，正看见台子上有几个人在“坐飞机”，那是老师留给我的第一个记忆。
    后来我背着书包进了那所学校，第一天班主任举着铅笔盒说，里面应该放两支铅笔。铅笔和铅笔盒已经换了好几代，老师也早退休了。有一天又在路上遇见，她却不像以往那样亲热，脸上露出几分疑惑的神情，显然她已经忘了我是谁。那时我恰好在北师大读书，立即省悟将来我也会有许多最后叫不出名字的学生。
    毕业后我没有当成老师，而是继续读书。诸多弟子如今各奔东西，缘分依旧。年初大师姐来京，我们在先生家聚会，那一天是2月28日。第二天一早我赶着去上班，师母已经做好早点，先生匆匆递给我一本他的新著。回家以后才发现，先生落款题的是2月29日。公元1989年的2月只有28天。在一个不存在的日子里，我得到了一本真实的书。
    无论老师自己是否记得学生，做学生的都不会忘记老师，即使仅仅为了自己。
    三年级时班主任扎着两条小辫子，她喜欢朗诵。虽然那时课文不过是“听那边练兵场杀声响亮”，她依然把我们逐个叫起来，仔细地纠正语气。很幸运我被认为是杀得好的，老师给我开了“小灶”。从此台上台下常常慷慨激昂地批林批孔，批师道尊严。可是后来大学同学都说我念得最好的是与“杀”毫不相干的徐志摩的诗。去年我在一部短片中做解说，我坚信如果没有那个扎着小辫子的老师，我决不会坐在录音棚的话筒前。然而我无法请老师来看片子。据说多年以前的一个深夜，她觉得肚子疼，用平板车送到医院，一时竟诊不出是什么病，当夜就活活疼死了。我们几个学生曾商量去看看她的后代，却听说她还没有孩子。
    高二的语文老师是特级教师，意外地听说他在旧社会是学商的。这才知道原来从小背三字经什么的有这些好处。那时文化革命已经结束，老师讲了很多古文，《祭十二郎文》、《陈情表》等等，从此在我心里中国散文击败了中国小说。上大学以后如饥似渴地找散文读，写论文时常得批语：语言不好。直到毕业了去向老师告别，老师还担忧地说，你的语言不是论文的语言，写散文当然是好的，也要练习着写论文。
    因为我就读的专业没有学位授予权，又回师大请老师去主持答辩。一进先生的书房，只见地中央多出一只铁皮的大澡盆，里面游着一头红鲤鱼。这鱼是买了预备吃的，因为好看舍不得杀，就养了起来。忍着笑说不好了，书房里有鲤鱼精了。先生说鱼是有点像人。开始它总是蹦到盆外来，只好围起一道屏障，后来它习惯了，拆了屏障它也不再跳了。
    人也不尽如此。比如我们的一位女老师，讲起话来热情洋溢，就像是专吹冲锋号的。她最不能容忍学生懒惰，总是鼓动我们不遗余力地跳。即使不知龙门在何处，先跳起来再说。那时研究生还比较稀罕，考试竞争对手多，复习时难免心虚，这时就直奔女老师家。后来才知道不少同学都以她家为加油站的，只是从没想过谁来给老师加油，当学生时以为老师全都是永动机。
    离开学校好几年了，并没有离开老师。偶尔发几篇稿子，也在老师的视线内。几位先生来信鼓励我要继续多写，女老师的爱人则用剪子一刀一刀地剪下来。老师有那么多学生，他怎么收集得全呢！
