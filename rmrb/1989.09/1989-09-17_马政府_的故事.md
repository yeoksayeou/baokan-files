	The Story of the "Horse Government"
	Lín Qīng, Dù Guó Táng, Lǐ Tiān Zēng

	One summer day, after a sudden rain, at a meeting of major grain sellers in Handan region, Hebei Province, an elderly farmer over sixty spoke, startling everyone present. He said, "Our family contracted over 20 mu of land, with an annual quota of 720 jin of grain. But for the past four years, we have delivered 5,000 jin of wheat to the state each year. This summer, we harvested a total of 5,150 jin. I heard that there was a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, and the country is in trouble. I delivered 5,000 jin at once. The remaining grain is not enough, so we mix it with some coarse grains to eat."

	He became emotional and continued, "From ancient times to the present, in which dynasty did farmers have the opportunity to live in new houses, eat fine grains, and live such a good life? This is all thanks to the Party's policy of enriching the people. People's hearts are made of flesh. I would rather eat something inferior myself, but I cannot let the state be in difficulty."

	His speech was met with rounds of applause. People discussed eagerly.

	One person said, "His speech is well-reasoned and cultured."

	Another immediately responded, "Look what you're saying, this is the level of the 'Horse Government.'"

	In fact, the "Horse Government" does not have the surname Ma, and his name is not Government. He is called Shēn Xīng Wǔ, a genuine farmer from Zhuāngkē Village, Guǎntáo County. Because he is born in the year of the horse and likes to manage some extra affairs for the government, the village, and others, people gave him the nickname "Horse Government."

	Just the other day, two of the "Horse Government's" neighbors had a dispute over a piece of residential land. The village cadres could not mediate, and the township government could not handle it. They were preparing to sue, aiming for a win or lose situation. The "Horse Government" heard about this and felt uncomfortable. He thought: Neighbors see each other every day; a lawsuit can create a feud for three generations. We cannot harbor such grudges. He went from one house to the other, persuading them earnestly, "Your two families have never had a dispute for generations. Now, because of a piece of residential land, you become enemies. It's not worth it. I will give up the residential land allocated to me by the village and give it to you. Don't sue."

	One of the neighbors who insisted on the residential land said, "For your sake, I won't sue, but I cannot accept your residential land." The "Horse Government" waved his hand and said, "If you don't accept it, I won't handle this matter." The "Horse Government's" generous behavior deeply moved the two neighbors. They lived harmoniously again.

	In recent years, after the implementation of the household responsibility system in rural areas, land plots have become smaller, and some people's minds have also changed. Coupled with a period of weakened party leadership in rural ideological and political work, many people think more about their own affairs and less about the state and the collective. Shēn Xīng Wǔ is different. He often says, "Country, country, without a country, how can there be a home? Without the prosperity of the country, how can there be happiness for the family?"

	The "Horse Government's" family has been the top grain and cotton producer in the village since 1983. He is still not satisfied and is considering his next steps. There is a plot of over 20 mu of wasteland at the village entrance, overgrown with weeds and desolate. He thought: People rely on land, and tigers rely on mountains. This old graveyard has been dormant for hundreds of years. If it is developed, it can benefit future generations. The "Horse Government" went to the village cadres and said, "I will give up the 20 mu of contracted land and just cultivate that piece of wasteland." The village cadres were surprised and asked him to consider it carefully. The "Horse Government" said, "I have discussed it with my family. We will just suffer a loss for a couple of years." Seeing his sincere attitude, the village cadres leased the old graveyard to him.

	The "Horse Government" led his family to clear bricks and level pits, fill in the north and south, working hard for two winters and springs. They plowed the land five times, wore out 40 plowshares, and picked up over 200 cubic meters of broken bricks before the land was leveled. On this basis, he insisted on intercropping fruits and grains, planting 500 peach trees and 500 apple trees. He dug wells, applied fertilizer, investing several thousand yuan in the land each year, and achieved a bumper harvest for four consecutive years. When we visited him, we saw his family eating steamed buns after the wheat harvest and could not help but respect them.

　　“马政府”的故事
　　林青　杜国堂　李天增
    仲夏的一天，骤雨初歇。在河北省邯郸地区召开的售粮大户座谈会上，一位年逾花甲的庄稼老汉的发言，语惊四座。他说：“俺一家承包了20多亩地，每年定购任务720公斤，可俺连着4年每年向国家上交5000公斤小麦。今年夏季，一共收了5150公斤，听说北京发生了反革命暴乱，国家有困难，俺一次上交5000公斤，剩下的口粮不足，就掺一些粗粮吃。”
    他动情了，接着说：“从古到今，哪朝哪代农民能家家户户住新房，吃细粮，过这样的好日子？这都托党的富民政策的福。人心都是肉长的，俺宁肯自己吃点赖的，也不能让国家作难。”
    他的发言，博得一阵阵掌声。人们议论纷纷。
    一个说：“他的发言有板有眼，真有点文化水哩。”
    另一个马上接茬：“看你说的，这就是‘马政府’的水平。”
    其实，“马政府”并非姓马，名字也不叫政府。他叫申兴武，是馆陶县庄科村的一个地地道道的老农。因为他属马，又爱替政府、替村里、替别人管些份外的事儿，人们送给他一个绰号，叫“马政府”。
    就说前不久，“马政府”的两个邻居因为一片宅基地，争吵不休，村干部调解不了，乡政府管不下来。他们准备往上打官司，弄个你输我赢。“马政府”听到这件事后，心里很不是滋味。他想：左邻右舍的，低头不见抬头见，一场官司三辈仇家，可不能结这个怨。他走了这家到那家，苦口婆心地劝说：“你们两家几辈子没红过脸，如今因一片宅基地结为仇家，划不来。我让出村里给我划的那份宅基地给你们，别打官司了。”其中一位坚持争宅基地的邻居说：“看你的面子，不打官司了，但你的宅基地我不能要。”“马政府”把手一摆说：“你不要我就不管这个事儿了。”“马政府”慷慨行为，使这两个邻居深受感动。他们又和睦相处了。
    近几年来，农村实行生产责任制后，地块变小了，有些人心田也变了。加上一个时期削弱了党在农村的思想政治工作，不少人想自家的事儿多了，想国家、想大家的事儿少了。申兴武却不同，他常说：“国家、国家，没有国哪有家。没有国家的强盛，哪有自家的幸福。”
      “马政府”一家打1983年起粮棉收入在全村就首屈一指。他依然不满足，又在考虑着自己下一步的打算。村头有一块20多亩宽的坟场，杂草丛生，满目荒凉。他琢磨：人凭土地虎凭山，眼前这块老坟地已沉睡了几百年，如果把它开发出来，不是能造福子孙吗？“马政府”却找到村干部说“我把原承包的20多亩责任田让出来，给我种那片荒地就行了。”村干部听了很吃惊，让他再认真考虑考虑。“马政府”说：“我和家里人都商量好了。无非是先吃两年亏。”村干部见他态度诚恳，就把那片老坟场承包给了他。
      “马政府”带领一家老小拾砖平坑，南起北垫，大干了两个冬春，耕翻了5遍，用坏了40口犁铧，拣了200多方烂砖头，才把土地平整好。在此基础上，他坚持果粮间作，栽了500株桃，500株苹果。打井施肥，每年向土地投资几千元，连续4年获得了大丰收。当我们登门采访他时，看到他一家老小在麦收之后啃窝头，不禁肃然起敬。
