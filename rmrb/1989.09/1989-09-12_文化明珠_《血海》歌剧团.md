	The "Sea of Blood" Opera Troupe is a cultural delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is about to gather with us in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of our country.

	This visiting Korean art troupe is primarily composed of the renowned "Sea of Blood" Opera Troupe, supplemented by outstanding performers from other central art troupes in Korea. The troupe consists of 611 members and will visit Tianjin, Shenyang, Beijing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen from September 15th, performing and participating in the Second Chinese Arts Festival and other performances.

	The "Sea of Blood" Opera Troupe was established on July 17, 1971, to meet the needs of modern Korean opera development. It has since grown to over 600 members. The troupe includes over 50 people's artists, people's performers, and meritorious performers, such as the renowned composer Kim Won-gyun, who is the author of "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and the national anthem "Aegukga," and has won the "Kim Il-sung Prize." Over the past decade, in addition to creating the revolutionary opera "Sea of Blood," the troupe has also composed and written many excellent musical and dance works, which have been performed on stage, marking new achievements in Korean opera art. They often perform in factories, rural areas, and fishing villages, carrying a rich variety of programs, and enjoy a high reputation at home. They have also taken operas like "Sea of Blood" and excellent dance programs to more than 50 countries and regions in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For their outstanding contributions, the troupe has been awarded the highest medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the "Kim Il-sung Medal."

	The Korean people are known for their singing and dancing talents, with performances that are delicate, bright in tone, and lively and passionate. Programs such as "Long Drum Dance," "Golden Bell Fairy," and "By the Spring" that were performed in China are still fresh in the memory of Chinese audiences.

	The members of the visiting art troupe are outstanding artists and performers from Korea. Among them, People's Performer Kim Sung-hwan is familiar to the Chinese people for his roles in multiple operas such as "The Flower Girl," and is a talented male vocalist; Meritorious Performer Cho Chŏng-mi played the female lead in the opera "Sea of Blood" and won an award at the Paris International Arts Competition in 1987, enjoying a high reputation in Korea. In addition to showcasing familiar programs such as "General Kim Il-sung's Song" for Chinese audiences, the Korean artists will also bring traditional Korean dance programs like "Hand Drum Dance" that reflect Korean national characteristics. They have also prepared many Chinese songs and dances, such as "Toast Song," "Xintianyou," and "Spring Rain," to express the friendly sentiments between the peoples of China and Korea.

　　赵赛珍
    正值我国各族人民喜庆建国四十周年的金秋时节，兄弟之邦的文化使者朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团，即将和我们欢聚一堂。
    这次来访的朝鲜艺术团，是以著名的《血海》歌剧团为主，并抽调朝鲜其它中央艺术团体中的优秀演员组成的。全团共611人，从9月15日起，将先后对天津、沈阳、北京、福州、厦门、广州、深圳等城市进行访问演出，并参加第二届中国艺术节和其他演出活动。
      《血海》歌剧团是为适应朝鲜现代歌剧的发展需要，于1971年7月17日创立的，现已发展到600多人。它拥有《金日成将军之歌》和
  《爱国歌》（国歌）的作者、“金日成桂冠奖”获得者、著名作曲家金元均为代表的50多位人民艺术家、人民演员、功勋演员。十多年来，不仅完成了革命歌剧《血海》的创作，而且还谱写和编写了许多优秀音乐、歌舞作品，先后搬上舞台，开创了朝鲜歌剧艺术的新业绩。他们经常以分队形式，携带丰富多采的节目深入厂矿、农村、渔村巡回演出，在国内享有极高的声誉。同时，还带着《血海》等歌剧作品和优秀歌舞节目，分赴欧、亚、非、拉美等50多个国家和地区进行演出。鉴于该团功勋卓著，曾被授予朝鲜最高勋章“金日成勋章”。
    朝鲜民族以能歌善舞著称，歌舞有表演细腻、色调明快、活泼热烈的特点，如曾来我国演出的《长鼓舞》、《金刚仙女》、《在泉边》等节目，我国观众至今记忆犹新。
    这次来访的艺术团成员，集中了朝鲜优秀的艺术家、演奏家。其中人民演员金承渊，在中国人民熟悉的《卖花姑娘》等多部歌剧中担任男主角，是一位颇有才华的男中音独唱歌手；功勋演员赵青美在歌剧《血海》中担任女主角，于1987年在巴黎国际艺术大赛上获奖，在朝鲜具有很高知名度。朝鲜艺术家这次访华演出，除展示中国观众所熟悉的《金日成将军之歌》等保留节目外，还为我国观众带来具有朝鲜民族特色的传统歌舞节目《手鼓舞》等，他们还准备了很多中国歌舞节目，如《祝酒歌》、《信天游》和《春雨》等，以表达中、朝两国人民的友好情谊。
