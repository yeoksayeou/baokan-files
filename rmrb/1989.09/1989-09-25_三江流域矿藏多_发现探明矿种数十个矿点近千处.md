Geologists in China have, after decades of effort, discovered and identified nearly a thousand mineral points of dozens of mineral types in the Jinsha, Lancang, and Nujiang river basins, drawing attention both domestically and internationally.

The Jinsha, Lancang, and Nujiang rivers flow through Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan, forming a region spanning over 1,900 kilometers from north to south, 280 kilometers from east to west, and covering an area of approximately 550,000 square kilometers. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Three Rivers region was designated as a key mineral exploration area by the state, and the exploration of mineral resources in the Three Rivers region became a major scientific and technological project. Tens of thousands of geologists have come here over the years, discovering 35 types of minerals, 158 mineral deposits, and nearly a thousand mineral points, primarily of non-ferrous metals. Among these, over 50 mineral sites are of large to medium scale. The region's proven reserves of lead, zinc, copper, and silver account for 1/5 to 1/4 of the national total, while reserves of rare metals such as thallium, strontium, and cadmium account for half of the national total. Geological experts believe that the abundance of mineral resources, the scale of mineral deposits, and the economic value in the Three Rivers region are rare even on a global scale. The region also has abundant water, geothermal, forest, and coal resources.

    三江流域矿藏多
    发现探明矿种数十个矿点近千处
    据新华社昆明电　（记者鱼世昌、中国地质报记者王正端）我国地质工作者经过数十年努力，在金沙江、澜沧江、怒江流域发现和探明了数十个矿种的近千处矿点，使这个大型成矿带受到国内外的关注。
    金沙江、澜沧江、怒江流经青海、西藏、四川、云南4省区，形成南北长1900多公里、东西宽280多公里、面积约55万平方公里的三江流域地区。新中国成立后，三江地区被国家列为重点找矿片区，探明三江地区矿藏成为重点科技攻关项目。数万名地质工作者先后来到这里，发现了以有色金属为主的35个矿种、158个矿床、近千处矿点，其中达到大中型规模的矿产地就有50多处。三江地区目前探明的铅、锌、铜、银储量分别占全国总储量的1／5到1／4，铊、锶、镉等稀有金属则占一半。有关地质专家认为，三江地区矿产之多，矿床规模之大，经济价值之高，在世界上也不多见。这里还有水能、地热、森林、煤炭等资源。
