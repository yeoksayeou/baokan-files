He said that over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriots have cooperated closely with our party, actively participated in political consultation and administration, and made significant contributions to the development of the broadest patriotic united front and the implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy.

He said that during the process of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, many comrades from various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriots have done a lot of work in difficult circumstances, playing an active role in stabilizing the situation. The cooperation between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties has further developed, and we should continue to work closely together. He reiterated that adhering to the four cardinal principles is the foundation of our country and the political basis for our party's cooperation with various democratic parties.
