The chairman of the Thai Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Zheng Mingru, and former Japanese Vice-President of the House of Representatives, Okada Haruo, have praised China's 40 years of achievements. A delegation from the Japanese Zhou Enlai Memorial Society came to Beijing to celebrate China's National Day.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 21 (Reporter Zhang Qiu Lai): On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zheng Mingru, chairman of the Thai Chinese Chamber of Commerce, accepted an interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter. He said that in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, significant achievements have been made in economic construction. China has transformed from a country that needed to import industrial machinery, production equipment, and even grain into a country capable of manufacturing cars, airplanes, and even launching satellites into space.

When talking about the reform and opening-up policy currently being implemented by the Chinese government, he said, "China's reform and opening-up policy has opened up a broad path for China's economic construction. Since China implemented the reform and opening-up policy, industry and commerce have flourished, national average annual income has increased significantly, and the living standards of urban residents and the vast majority of farmers have improved significantly. China's reform and opening-up policy is beneficial for China to achieve modernization as soon as possible."

He said that with the development of the economy, China's status in the international arena is becoming increasingly important. He said, "Without China's participation, major global issues cannot be resolved satisfactorily."

He said, "Thai-Chinese trade and economic cooperation are mutually beneficial and have unlimited broad prospects, which are of great benefit to the economic prosperity and happiness of the people of both countries."

He expressed that the Thai Chinese Chamber of Commerce will continue to "enthusiastically support" and "actively participate" in the cause of further developing Thai-Chinese friendly cooperative relations.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 20 (Reporters Zhu Ronggen, Tan Jianrong): Former Vice-President of the Japanese House of Representatives and prominent Japan-China friendship advocate Okada Haruo said today here that the history of New China is only 40 years old, and in these 40 years, China has undergone many changes, and these changes are great. Mr. Okada made these remarks on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in an interview with a reporter from this news agency.

Okada Haruo said that China is currently lagging behind in many areas, but this backward situation should be overcome through the policies of the Chinese government and the efforts of the people. He believes that the most fundamental aspect of the Chinese government's implementation of reform and opening-up is to let China continue to develop along the socialist path.

He believes that while continuing to adhere to reform and opening-up, China must be vigilant against the conspiracies of a small number of anti-China forces overseas.

Mr. Okada said, "Engaging in Japan-China friendship activities is one of the most important parts of my political life. In 1953, I made my first visit to China, and at that time, I swore in my heart: I will definitely do my utmost for the cause of Japan-China friendship."

The People's Daily reports that the Japanese friendship organization Zhou Enlai Memorial Society delegation, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of China's National Day, held a celebratory reception on the evening of September 20 in Beijing. Otani Takeyama, the secretary-general of the Zhou Enlai Memorial Society, delivered a passionate speech at the event, praising China's achievements over the past 40 years. He said that he firmly believes that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China will definitely unite as one and walk a more prosperous and powerful path.

The Zhou Enlai Memorial Society delegation to China was invited by the China International Talent Exchange Foundation to come to Beijing.

    据新华社曼谷九月二十一日电  （记者张秋来）泰国中华总商会主席郑明如在中华人民共和国成立四十周年前夕接受新华社记者采访时说，中华人民共和国成立四十年来，经济建设取得了显著的成就。中国已经由一个工业机械和生产设备乃至粮食等需要进口的国家，变成一个具有制造汽车、飞机甚至发射太空卫星能力的国家。
    他在谈到中国政府正在执行的改革开放政策时说，“中国改革开放政策，为中国的经济建设开辟了广阔的道路。中国自从实行改革开放政策以来工商业蓬勃发展，国民平均年收入显著增加，城市居民和广大农民生活有了显著的改善。中国改革开放政策有利于中国尽早实现四个现代化”。
    他说，随着经济的发展，中国在国际上的地位愈来愈重要。他说，“世界的大事，缺少中国的参与是不能圆满解决的。”
    他说，“泰中贸易和经济合作、互惠互利，有无限广阔的前景，对两国经济繁荣和人民幸福都有极大益处。”
    他表示泰国中华总商会将继续“热情支持”和“积极参加”进一步发展泰中友好合作关系的事业。
    据新华社东京九月二十日电　（记者朱荣根、谈建荣）原日本众议院副议长、著名日中友好人士冈田春夫今天在这里说，新中国的历史只有四十年，在这四十年里中国发生了许多变化，这种变化是伟大的。冈田先生是在中华人民共和国成立四十周年前夕对本社记者发表这番谈话的。
    冈田春夫说，中国目前在不少领域还很落后，但这种落后状况应靠中国政府的方针和人民的努力予以克服。他认为，中国政府实行改革开放最基本的一点，就是要让中国沿着社会主义道路不断向前发展。
    他认为，中国在继续坚持改革开放的同时，必须警惕海外一小撮反华势力的阴谋。
    冈田先生说：“从事日中友好活动是我政治生活中最重要的部分之一。一九五三年我首次访问中国，那时我就在心里发誓：一定要为日中友好事业竭尽全力。”
    本报讯　日本友好团体周恩来纪念会访华代表团，为庆贺我国庆四十周年，九月二十日晚在北京举行祝贺招待会。周恩来纪念会干事长大谷竹山在会上发表了热情的讲话，盛赞我国四十年来取得的成就。他说，坚信中国在中国共产党的领导下一定能够团结一心，走更加繁荣富强的道路。
