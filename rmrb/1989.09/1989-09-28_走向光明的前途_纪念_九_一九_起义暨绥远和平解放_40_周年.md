Forty years ago, on September 19, the famous Suiyuan Uprising was held under the wise decision of the Party Central Committee. This was a great victory and concrete embodiment of Chairman Mao's "Suiyuan method." The "September 19" Uprising in Suiyuan saved the 100,000 Nationalist troops who were surrounded on all sides, and it spared the historic northern city of Guihua (now Hohhot) from the ravages of war. The "September 19" Uprising in Suiyuan marked the rebirth and liberation of Suiyuan, standing as a historical monument on the land of Suiyuan and etched in the hearts of the people.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, I deeply mourn the passing of Comrade Li Jingyuan this year and the famous patriotic general Bo Yibo. At the same time, I also deeply miss General Fu Zuoyi, who made outstanding contributions to the liberation of Suiyuan, and my close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Yao Zhe.

	I. The Irresistible Momentum of the Revolution

Suiyuan (now the western part of Inner Mongolia) is vast in area and rich in resources and products. It is an important strategic region in northern China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party opened up vast revolutionary base areas and liberated areas in the Suiyuan region. On May 14, 1938, Chairman Mao pointed out to Comrades Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Guan Xiangying, and Xiao Ke: "It is very important to establish a base area north of Ping-Sui along the Daqing Mountains. Please consider this matter promptly." Comrades He Long and Guan Xiangying paid great attention to Chairman Mao's opinion. They selected and dispatched Comrade Li Jingyuan, political commissar of the 358th Brigade of the 120th Division, and Comrade Yao Zhe, chief of staff, along with others, to advance into the Daqing Mountains to establish a revolutionary base area. They joined forces with the Mongolian-Han Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army led by Comrades Yang Zhuolang and Gao Fengying, and carried out a heroic and arduous struggle against Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, after three years of repeated confrontations with Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops, our army continued to grow and strengthen. By the eve of the liberation of Suiyuan in 1949, the troops had grown to five divisions with over 30,000 personnel, liberating most of eastern Suiyuan and reaching a population of over 800,000 in the liberated areas.

After the victory of the Pingjin Campaign, General Fu Zuoyi issued a public statement on April 1, 1949, expressing his sincerity to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in handing over Beijing and participating in the revolution. He said, "Looking back on the past, I feel that my biggest mistake was to implement the reactionary 'pacification' policy." He called on everyone not to hesitate or waver, not to go against the wishes of the people and the historical laws of social development. Chairman Mao replied on April 2, "The peaceful resolution of the Beijing issue, General Fu, has contributed greatly. General Fu also wishes to stand on the side of the people in the future and participate in the construction of the new democratic revolution. We believe this is very good and should be welcomed." The revolutionary tide is irresistible, and the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan has also become an inevitable trend.

	II. Chairman Mao Initiates the "Suiyuan Method"

The "Suiyuan method" is a specific approach proposed by Chairman Mao based on the realities of the Chinese revolution to advance the liberation of the entire country and achieve national reunification. It is also one of the "three methods" (i.e., the "Beijing method," the "Tianjin method," and the "Suiyuan method").

After the peaceful liberation of Beijing, facing the 100,000 Nationalist troops in the Suiyuan region, our Party did not rashly resort to military attacks but chose the path of peaceful resolution. In February 1949, Chairman Mao, during a meeting with Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan at Xibaipo, proposed a plan to resolve the Suiyuan issue. Chairman Mao said, "With the peaceful liberation of Beijing, the Suiyuan issue is easier to resolve," "The Suiyuan issue should be divided into a temporary ceasefire line, allowing General Bo to do good work within Suiyuan, and he can decide the appropriate time to launch the uprising." On March 5, Chairman Mao, at the historically significant Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, explained: "The Suiyuan method is to intentionally preserve a part of the Nationalist troops, leaving them intact or largely unchanged, that is, making a temporary concession to this part of the troops to facilitate their political alignment with us or maintaining neutrality, so that we can concentrate our forces to first resolve the main part of the remaining Nationalist forces. After a considerable period of time (such as a few months, half a year, or a year), we can then reorganize this part of the troops into the People's Liberation Army according to the system of the People's Liberation Army." Chairman Mao, with his far-sighted vision, starting from the overall situation and needs of liberating the entire country, decisively proposed the "Suiyuan method," making another important strategic creation in the history of our Party and our army.

	III. The Signing of the Suiyuan Peace Agreement

After the liberation of Beijing, our side conducted multiple secret negotiations and consultations with the Fu side. General Fu Zuoyi believed that the conditions were not yet ripe, and with Chiang Kai-shek frequently sabotaging, for a period, both sides did not reach an agreement. The Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee placed the "Suiyuan method" on an important agenda. Chairman Mao had seven conversations with General Fu Zuoyi, one of which lasted a day and a night. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai personally resolved the specific issues raised by General Fu. On March 25, 1949, the leaders of the Central Military Commission hosted a banquet for Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan at the Beijing Hotel, conveying the Party Central Committee's decision for Comrade He Long to lead the negotiations on the Suiyuan issue. Subsequently, due to the original Jin-Sui area being placed under the leadership of the North China Bureau, the leadership of the negotiations changed to Comrades Bo Yi and Nie Rongzhen. Our representatives were: Li Jingyuan, political commissar of the Jin-Sui Military Region, Zhang Youyu, secretary of the North China Bureau, and Pan Jimin, head of the Urban Work Department of the Sui-Meng Area Party Committee; the Fu side's representatives were: Zhou Beifeng, secretary of the North China "Suppression Headquarters" and former governor of Suiyuan, and Yan Youwen, deputy director of the Political Work Department of the North China "Suppression Headquarters."

After the negotiations began, due to the delay in presenting the ceasefire line plan, our side showed impatience. Vice Chairman Zhou criticized our mindset, saying, "To realize the 'Suiyuan method,' we should not be impatient. We need to understand their situation. We need to be patient and wait for them to awaken, but also work actively. Otherwise, it will not be the 'Suiyuan method'." In the context of the People's Liberation Army liberating Nanjing and Shanghai, both sides began another round of negotiations. However, due to the division of the temporary demarcation line and the issue of currency exchange, both sides were at an impasse. When Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhou learned that the negotiations had reached a stalemate, they ordered our side to make concessions to promote the early signing of the agreement. On May 28, 1949, both sides formally reached the "Suiyuan Peace Agreement." On June 8, in the second-floor conference room of the North China People's Government in Beijing, the signing ceremony for the "Suiyuan Peace Agreement" was held. Afterwards, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhou, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De received Generals Fu Zuoyi, Deng Baoshan, Zhou Beifeng, and Yan Youwen at Zhongnanhai. The signing of the peace agreement took another difficult step towards the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan.

	IV. Laying a Solid Foundation for the Uprising

To adapt to the new situation of the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, on April 1, 1949, the Party Central Committee placed the Sui-Meng Area under the jurisdiction of the North China Bureau. On June 14, the North China People's Government decided to change the Sui-Meng Area to Suiyuan Province, and the original Sui-Meng Area Party Committee was correspondingly changed to the Suiyuan Provincial Party Committee. The original Sui-Meng Area and the Eighth Army of the Field Army were merged into the Suiyuan Provincial Military Region. I served as the secretary of the provincial committee, and Su Qianyi as the deputy secretary; Yao Zhe served as the commander of the provincial military region, and I as the political commissar. The provincial committee and provincial government were located in Fengzhen, and the provincial military region was moved to Jining.

After the signing of the "Suiyuan Peace Agreement," the provincial committee, according to the instructions of the North China Bureau, decided to establish the Liaison Office in Guihua. Pan Jimin was appointed as the director, and Lu Zhihao as the chief. Its main tasks were: to assist General Bo Yibo in implementing the "Agreement," to propagate our Party's policy of peaceful liberation of Suiyuan, to win over progressive figures, to unite the broad masses, to isolate and split the stubborn forces, to expose and strike at Chiang Kai-shek's spies, and to quickly achieve peaceful liberation. After many twists and turns, the Liaison Office was finally allowed to enter Guihua on July 11. As soon as the Liaison Office personnel appeared in Guihua, people spread the news, celebrating it as good news. However, a small group of reactionaries were enraged and, on July 24, staged an incident where they killed Wang Shixin, the secretary of our railway work team. General Bo Yibo was deeply concerned and personally visited the Liaison Office to express his condolences, stating that he would arrest the culprits. The Party Central Committee also paid great attention to this incident. Chairman Mao, while working with General Fu Zuoyi, also worked with us. In early August, Chairman Mao summoned me and Comrades Yang Zhuolang and Pan Jimin, saying, "We have fought with Fu Zuoyi for many years. Although we are in a victorious situation, adopting the 'Suiyuan method' is beneficial to the people. As long as we are magnanimous, benevolent, and sincere, the 'Suiyuan method' will definitely be realized." "The Liaison Office will not withdraw from Guihua and will continue to promote the improvement of the situation in Suiyuan; a memorial service will be held for Comrade Wang Shixin, but there will be no procession, and the corpse will not be carried in a procession; the 'Suiyuan method' will not change, and all communications will remain the same." After returning to Suiyuan, we widely propagated the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, using this to unify the thoughts and actions of cadres and the masses.

From the end of August to early September, the Suiyuan Provincial Party Committee held an expanded meeting in Jining with county and regimental-level cadres, further conveying and studying the policies of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the North China Bureau regarding the liberation of Suiyuan, achieving satisfactory results. All of this laid a solid ideological and mass foundation for the realization of the "Suiyuan method" and the promotion of a peaceful uprising.

	V. The Glorious Uprising Brings New Life

Chiang Kai-shek and a small group of diehards tried every means to obstruct and sabotage the liberation of Suiyuan. He sent the Chief of the Military Affairs Department, Xu Yongchang, and the Commander of the Air Force, Wang Shuming, to Suiyuan to confer titles and make promises, promoting Bo Yibo to the position of Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Military and Political Affairs, and appointing Sun Lanfeng as the Commander of the Ninth Army Corps, attempting to win them over. He also used money to bribe and buy them, sending 1,900 taels of gold. Bo Yibo was already alert to Chiang Kai-shek's tactics of promotion and demotion, and he sent reliable personnel to strengthen control over the Ninth Army Corps, refusing to hand over military power.

To accelerate the process of the uprising, our Party invited Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan to Suiyuan to organize the uprising with General Bo Yibo. When the train passed through Fengzhen and Jining, I and Comrade Yao Zhe boarded the train to meet them. On September 4, General Bo Yibo arrived in Baotou with General Fu. General Fu propagated the revolutionary situation to the military, division, and brigade-level cadres, pointing out the direction, explaining the Communist Party's policy of "uprising is meritorious, past actions are not held against," and dispelling the concerns of the officers and soldiers. On September 15, Xu Yongchang, carrying personal letters from Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan, flew to Baotou again, attempting to take General Fu Zuoyi to Guangzhou. General Fu firmly rejected this, foiling Chiang Kai-shek's plot to sabotage the peaceful liberation once again.

September 19 is a day forever worth remembering. Led by General Bo Yibo, 39 military and political officials and representatives from various ethnic groups and sectors in Suiyuan, after a long period of preparation, formally issued a telegram to announce the uprising. In their telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Nie Rongzhen, and Political Commissar Bo Yi, they said, "Today, all our officers and soldiers and administrative personnel at all levels have launched a glorious uprising in Suiyuan and solemnly declare to the people: We have formally broken away from the remnants of the reactionary clique of Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan, who rely on American imperialism, and resolutely stand on the side of the people." The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao highly evaluated the significance of the "September 19" uprising. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu replied, "You have led your troops to rebel, breaking away from the reactionaries and standing on the side of the people. We hope you will unite and strive for progress, reform old systems, implement new policies, and strive to build a new Suiyuan for the people." Commander Nie Rongzhen and Political Commissar Bo Yi of the North China Military Region also sent a reply, highly praising the patriotic actions of General Bo Yibo and others, and encouraging the uprising troops, "Transform the army into a true People's Liberation Army, and strive to build a new Suiyuan, a new North China, and to completely liberate the whole of China."

	VI. Establishing the New People's Democratic Government

Twelve days after the "September 19" uprising in Suiyuan, our great People's Republic was officially born. In early October, General Fu Zuoyi and I attended a meeting of the North China Bureau, chaired by Comrades Bo Yi and Nie Rongzhen, to discuss the work plan for Suiyuan and basically reached a consensus: the two provincial governments would immediately merge, and finance, grain, railways, and various policies and laws would be unified under the common program; all Bo's troops would be organized into two armies (excluding cavalry), and our side would send high-level cadres to assist within three to six months, establish a cadre training team, and be responsible for training; all supplies for Bo's troops would be fully provided by our side; preliminary proposals were made for the composition of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee.

On the evening of October 24, we spent an unforgettable night. Chairman Mao received the relevant leaders of Suiyuan again. At 10:30 PM, I, Yao Zhe, and Pei Zhouyu boarded a car to Zhongnanhai. Premier Zhou first received us in his office. Half an hour later, Comrades Bo Yi and Nie Rongzhen also arrived. Premier Zhou then led the five comrades to walk to Chairman Mao's residence. Chairman Mao inquired about the situation in Suiyuan and asked, "Do you have confidence in sending cadres to Suiyuan?" I replied, "With the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, everyone is very confident. But there are also some reflections, such as feeling that it is not as satisfying as fighting a battle." Chairman Mao said, "The peaceful liberation of Suiyuan has been discussed for half a year, and now the first step has been realized. Now is the implementation of cooperation, and the second step is very important. They issued a telegram on September 19, and we also sent a telegram. This telegram is the basic policy of the Party towards Suiyuan, and the Communist Party must implement it. You must make comrades understand the necessity and significance of cooperation, what are the benefits? What are the reasons? Everything is for the benefit of the people; fighting is to seek liberation for the people; peaceful liberation, unity, and transformation are also for the benefit of the people." Soon, General Fu Zuoyi also arrived. Chairman Mao said again, "The policy of unity and transformation in Suiyuan has been decided... The work should be carried out step by step to achieve greater results for the whole country to see. We must cooperate to get things done. In the past, they were enemies, but now they have become friends." Chairman Mao's patient and earnest teachings increased the confidence of the Suiyuan comrades in building a new Suiyuan.

On December 2, the Central People's Government appointed Fu Zuoyi as the chairman of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, and Gao Kelin, Ulanfu, Bo Yibo, and Sun Lanfeng as vice chairmen. On December 13, the Central People's Government Military Commission appointed Fu Zuoyi as the commander of the Suiyuan Provincial Military Region, and Ulanfu, Bo Yibo, Yao Zhe, and Sun Lanfeng as deputy commanders; Bo Yi was appointed as the political commissar, and Gao Kelin, Yang Yepeng, and Wang Kejun as deputy political commissars. The jurisdiction of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee included: the former ten counties of the eastern Suiyuan liberated area, the entire liberated area of the Yikezhao League of the northwestern liberated area, and the Suiyuan region led by General Bo Yibo, totaling 2 leagues, 18 banners, 22 counties, and 3 cities. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government also decided to place Guihua and Baotou under provincial jurisdiction, with Guihua as the provincial capital.

January 1, 1950, was the first New Year's Day after the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan. Over 40,000 military and civilian personnel in Guihua gathered to enthusiastically celebrate the establishment of the Suiyuan people's democratic new government. The dragon dance teams from various departments, troops, schools, and factories also flooded the streets, singing and dancing, celebrating the rebirth of Suiyuan.

The liberation of Suiyuan has been 40 years. The People's Republic has also gone through 40 springtimes. History is unforgettable. We hope that the liberation cause won by the revolutionary martyrs with their precious lives, and the People's Republic built by the heroic sons and daughters with sweat, will last for thousands of generations and never fade.

    走向光明的前途
    ——纪念“九·一九”起义暨绥远和平解放40周年
    高克林
    40年前的9月19日，在党中央的英明决策下举行的著名的绥远起义，是毛主席首创的“绥远方式”的伟大胜利和具体体现。绥远“九·一九”起义，使四面楚歌的10万国民党军队绝路逢生，使历史悠久的塞北文化名城归绥市（现呼和浩特市）免遭战火之焚。绥远“九·一九”起义，标志着绥远的新生和解放，它是一座历史的丰碑，矗立在绥远大地，铭刻在民众心间。
    在纪念绥远和平解放40周年之际，我深切地哀悼今年刚刚去世的李井泉同志和著名爱国将领董其武将军，同时也无限地缅怀为绥远解放立下卓越功勋的傅作义将军和亲密的老战友姚喆同志。
        一、革命之势不可阻挡
    绥远（现内蒙古西部地区）地域辽阔，资源、物产丰富，是我国北部的重要战略地区。抗日战争期间，我党在绥远地区开辟了大片革命根据地和解放区。1938年5月14日，毛主席曾向朱德、彭德怀、贺龙、关向应、肖克同志指出：在平绥以北沿大青山脉建立根据地甚关重要，请他们迅即考虑此事。贺龙、关向应同志很重视毛主席的意见，选调一二零师三五八旅政委李井泉同志、参谋长姚喆同志等率部挺进大青山创立革命根据地，与杨植霖、高凤英等同志领导的蒙汉抗日游击队汇合，开展了抗日的艰苦卓绝的奋勇斗争。抗战胜利后，经过与蒋介石反动军队三年的多次较量，我军不断发展壮大，到1949年绥远解放前夕，部队已有5个师3万余人，解放了绥东大部，解放区人口达到80余万人。
    平津战役取得胜利后，傅作义将军于1949年4月1日发表公开声明，向党中央、毛主席表明了交出北平，参加革命的诚意，他说：“现在回忆既往，我感觉我最大的错误，就是执行了反动的戡乱政策。”他号召大家不要再犹豫、徘徊，不要违背人民的愿望和社会发展的历史规律。毛主席4月2日即复电傅作义将军“北平问题的和平解决，贵将军与有劳绩，贵将军复愿于今后站在人民方面，参加新民主主义的建设事业，我们认为这是很好的，这是应当欢迎的”。革命洪流是不可阻挡的，和平解放绥远也已成大势所趋。
        二、毛主席首创“绥远方式”
    “绥远方式”是毛主席根据中国革命实际，为推进全国解放，实现和平统一大业而提出的一种解决绥远问题的具体方式，也是“三种方式”（即“北平方式”、“天津方式”、“绥远方式”）之一。
      北平和平解放后，面对绥远地区号称10万之众的国民党军队，我党没有贸然采取军事进攻，而是选择了和平解决问题的途径。 1949年2月，毛主席在西柏坡会见傅作义、邓宝珊两将军时，提出了解决绥远问题的设想。毛主席说“有了北平和平解放，绥远问题就好解决了”，“绥远问题划分一个临时停战分界线，让董将军做好绥远内部工作，他认为适当的时候再举行起义”。3月5日，毛主席在具有历史意义的党的七届二中全会上阐述说：“绥远方式，是有意地保存一部分国民党军队，让他原封不动，或者大体上不动，就是说向这一部分军队作暂时的让步，以利于争取这部分军队在政治上站在我们方面，或者保持中立，以便我们集中力量首先解决国民党残余力量中的主要部分，在一个相当的时间之后（例如在几个月，半年，或者一年后），再去按照人民解放军制度将这部分军队改编为人民解放军。”毛主席高瞻远瞩，从解放全中国的大局和需要出发，果断地提出了“绥远方式”，在我党我军历史上做出了又一个重要的战略性创造。
        三、绥远和平协议的签订
    我方在北平解放后，与傅方进行了多次秘密谈判和协商。傅作义将军认为条件尚不成熟，加之蒋介石频繁地破坏，在一段时间里，双方没有达成协议。党的七届二中全会将“绥远方式”提到重要的议事日程。毛主席曾先后七次找傅作义将军谈话，其中一次谈了一天一夜。周恩来副主席亲自出面解决傅将军提出的具体问题。1949年3月25日，中央军委领导在北京饭店宴请傅作义、邓宝珊两将军时，传达了党中央关于由贺龙同志主持绥远问题谈判的决定。此后，由于原晋绥区划归华北局领导，主持谈判工作的领导改为薄一波、聂荣臻同志。我方代表是：晋绥军区政委李井泉、华北局秘书长张友渔、绥蒙区党委城工部长潘纪文；傅方代表是：华北“剿总”秘书长、原绥远政府厅长周北峰、华北“剿总”政工处副处长阎又文。
    谈判开始后，因停战分界线方案没有很快拿出，我方出现急躁情绪，周副主席针对我们这种思想批评说：“实现‘绥远方式’不要急，我们要理解他们的处境。要耐心等待他们觉悟，又要积极工作。否则，就不成其‘绥远方式’了。”在人民解放军解放南京、上海的形势下，双方又开始一轮谈判。但由于临时分界线的划分和金圆券兑换问题，双方争执不下。毛主席、周副主席得悉谈判又陷入僵局时，即令我方作出让步，以促进尽快达成协议。1949年5月28日，双方正式达成了《绥远和平协议》。6月8日，在北平华北人民政府二楼会议室，举行了《绥远和平协议》的签字仪式。其后，毛主席、周副主席、朱总司令在中南海接见了傅作义、邓宝珊、周北峰、阎又文。和平协议的签订，使绥远向和平解放道路又迈进了艰难的一步。
        四、为起义奠定良好的基础
    为适应绥远和平解放的新形势，1949年4月1日，党中央将绥蒙区划归华北局管辖。6月14日华北人民政府决定将绥蒙区改为绥远省，原绥蒙区党委相应改为绥远省委，原绥蒙区和野战军第八军合编为绥远省军区。我为省委书记，苏谦益为副书记；姚喆为省军区司令员，我为政治委员。省委、省政府设在丰镇，省军区移驻集宁。
    《绥远和平协议》签订后，省委根据华北局的指示，决定成立驻归绥联络处，以潘纪文为处长，鲁志浩为主任。其主要任务是：协助董其武将军贯彻执行《协议》，宣传我党和平解放绥远的政策，争取进步人士，团结广大群众，分化孤立顽固势力，揭露和打击蒋介石的特务，尽快实现和平解放。联络处在经过许多周折后，才获准于7月11日进入归绥市。联络处的干部一出现在归绥，人们就奔走相告，传为喜讯。而一小撮反动分子却恼羞成怒，在7月24日制造了杀害我铁路工作组秘书王士鑫同志的事件。董其武将军对此深感不安，亲赴联络处慰问，表示要缉拿凶手。党中央也颇为重视这一事件。毛主席一面做傅作义将军的工作，一面又做我们的工作。8月初，毛主席召见了我和杨植霖、潘纪文同志，说：“我们和傅作义打了多年仗。尽管我们处于胜利态势。但采取‘绥远方式’对人民有利。只要我们宽大为怀，与人为善，以诚相待，‘绥远方式’就一定能实现。”“联络处不撤出归绥，继续促使绥远局势好转；给王士鑫烈士开追悼会，但不搞游行，更不准抬尸游行；‘绥远方式’不变，一切来往照旧。”我们回到绥远后，广泛地宣传了毛主席的指示精神，以此统一干部和群众的思想与行动。
    8月底至9月初，绥远省委在集宁召开了县团级干部参加的扩大会，进一步传达学习党中央、毛主席和华北局关于解放绥远问题的方针政策，取得了满意的效果。这些，都为实现“绥远方式”，促成和平起义，奠定了良好的思想基础和群众基础。
            五、光荣起义获新生
    蒋介石等一小撮顽固分子，千方百计地阻止和破坏绥远的解放，他派遣军令部长徐永昌、空军司令王叔铭飞到绥远封官许愿，晋升董其武为西北军政副长官，委任孙兰峰为第九兵团司令，企图进行拉拢。还以金钱利诱和收买，送去1900两黄金。对蒋介石明升暗降，架空董其武的拙劣伎俩，董将军早已警觉，他派可靠人员加强了对第九兵团的控制，绝不交出兵权。
    为加速起义的进程，我党请傅作义、邓宝珊两将军赴绥远，协同董其武将军组织起义。在火车途经丰镇、集宁时，我和姚喆等同志登车会见了他们。9月4日，董其武将军随傅将军到达包头市，傅将军向军、师、旅级干部宣传了革命形势，指明了方向，阐明了共产党“起义有功，既往不咎”的政策，消除了官兵们的思想顾虑。9月15日，徐永昌携带蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山的亲笔信，再次飞来包头市，企图将傅作义接到广州。傅将军义正词严予以拒绝，使蒋介石破坏和平解放事业的阴谋诡计再度落空。
    9月19日，是永远值得纪念的一天，以董其武将军为首的绥远军政要员和地方各族、各界代表39人，在经过了长时间的酝酿和准备后，正式通电举行起义。他们在致毛主席、朱总司令、聂荣臻司令员和薄一波政委的电报中说：“我们全体官兵和各级行政人员，今天在绥远发动了光荣起义，并庄严地向人民宣布：我们正式脱离依靠美帝国主义的蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山等反动派残余集团，坚决走到人民方面来。”党中央、毛主席高度地评价了“九·一九”起义的重要意义。毛主席和朱总司令员给起义官兵复电：“你们已经率部起义，脱离反动派，站在人民方面了。希望你们团结一致，力求进步，改革旧制度，实行新政策，为建设人民的新绥远而奋斗。”华北军区聂荣臻司令员、薄一波政委也发了复电，高度赞扬董其武将军等的爱国行动，同时勉励起义官兵：“把军队改编成真正的人民解放军，为建设新绥远、新华北及彻底解放全中国而奋斗。”
        六、建立人民民主新政权
    绥远“九·一九”起义后的第12天，我们伟大的人民共和国正式诞生了。10月上旬，傅作义将军和我出席了由薄一波、聂荣臻同志主持的华北局会议，商讨绥远的工作方案，并基本取得了一致意见：两个省政府立即进行合并，财政、粮食、铁道等，以及各项政策、法令等，均在共同纲领指导下统一起来；所有董部军队按两个军（骑兵除外）进行编制，我方在三至六个月内只派较高级干部进去帮助工作，成立干部轮训队，由我方负责训练；所有董部之供给，完全由我方负责；初步提议了绥远军政委员会的组成人员。
    10月24日晚，我们度过一个难忘之夜，毛主席再次接见了绥远有关负责人。晚十时半，我和姚喆、裴周玉同志乘车来到中南海。周总理首先在办公室接见了我们。半小时后，薄一波、聂荣臻同志也陆续到达。周总理即带领这五位同志步行来到毛主席的住所。毛主席询问了绥远方面的情况，问：“你们干部去绥远有信心吗？”我回答“有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，大家信心很足。但也有些反映，如认为没有打仗痛快”。毛主席说：“绥远和平解放谈了大半年，现在才实现第一步。现在是实现合作，第二步很重要。他们9月19日已发了通电，我们也发了电报。这个电报是党对绥远的基本方针，共产党更要执行。你们要使同志们了解合作的必要性，意义何在？有什么好处？原因在哪里？一切为人民的利益，打仗是为了人民求解放；和平解放，团结改造，也是为了人民的利益。”一会儿，傅作义将军也来了。毛主席又说：“绥远的团结改造方针已定下来了……工作要有步骤地进行，做出更大成绩来给全国看。要合作把事情办好。过去是敌人，现在成了朋友。”毛主席循循善诱的谆谆教诲，使绥远同志增强了建设新绥远的信心。
    12月2日，中央人民政府任命傅作义为绥远军政委员会主席，高克林、乌兰夫、董其武、孙兰峰为副主席。12月13日，中央人民政府军事委员会任命傅作义为绥远省军区司令员，乌兰夫、董其武、姚喆、孙兰峰为副司令员；任命薄一波兼政治委员，高克林、杨叶澎、王克俊为副政治委员。绥远军政委员会管辖的范围为：前绥东解放区十县，原属西北解放区伊克昭盟解放区全部，以及董其武将军所领导的绥西地区，共计2个盟、18个旗、22个县、3个市。绥远省人民政府还决定归绥、包头两市为省辖市，以归绥市为省会。
      1950年元旦，是绥远和平解放后的第一个元旦。归绥市四万多军民集会，热烈庆贺绥远人民民主新政权的建立。各机关、部队、学校、厂矿的秧歌队也涌上街头，载歌载舞，欢庆绥远的新生。
    绥远解放已经40周年了，人民共和国也已经度过了整整40个春秋。历史是不容忘记的。我们期望，革命先烈以宝贵生命赢得的解放事业，英雄儿女挥汗建造的人民共和国，千秋万代，永不变色。
