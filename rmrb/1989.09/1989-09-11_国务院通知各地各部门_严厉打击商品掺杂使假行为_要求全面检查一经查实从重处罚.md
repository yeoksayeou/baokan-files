The State Council has recently issued a notice requiring all regions and departments to severely crack down on the practice of adulterating and falsifying goods.

The State Council pointed out that in recent times, some production, procurement, storage, domestic sales, foreign trade export units, and individuals have blatantly disregarded national laws and regulations, openly adulterating and falsifying goods to seek exorbitant profits. Some have even turned adulteration and falsification into a "profitable" profession, going so far as to establish enterprises for this purpose. Currently, the prevalence of adulterated goods and the maliciousness of the methods used have reached an appalling level. Adulterated goods not only seriously harm agricultural and industrial production, causing immense losses to the national economy, but also damage the reputation of the state and enterprises, severely harming the interests of consumers. Some even endanger personal safety, leading to strong dissatisfaction among the masses. Such speculative and fraudulent behavior must be resolutely stopped and severely punished.

The State Council hereby notifies as follows:

1. All levels of people's governments and relevant departments of the State Council must immediately organize the departments of industry and commerce administration, technical supervision, commodity inspection, public security, foreign trade, materials, commerce, and production management to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the issue of adulterating and falsifying goods in production, procurement, storage, domestic sales, industrial users, and foreign trade export units and locations. Units and individuals found to have adulterated or falsified goods must be ordered to cease operations immediately and undergo an investigation.

2. For units and individuals found to have adulterated or falsified goods, relevant departments must, in accordance with their respective responsibilities, impose heavy penalties as stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Speculation and Fraud" and the opinions of the State Council Office on the "Severe Punishment of Those Responsible for Selling Fake and Substandard Goods" issued by the State Technical Supervision Bureau. For serious cases, business licenses must be revoked. For adulterated goods that have been sold, all sales proceeds must be confiscated, and heavy fines must be imposed. If the sales proceeds have been used for other purposes, their property can be confiscated to cover the fines. Unsold adulterated goods must be confiscated, and heavy fines must be imposed. The industry and commerce administrative management departments have the right to inquire about and freeze the bank deposits of units and individuals involved in adulteration and falsification. For those who refuse to pay the fines, the funds can be forcibly transferred.

For goods reported for export that are found to be adulterated or falsified, the State Commodity Inspection Department will handle them in accordance with relevant regulations.

3. For the responsible persons and direct perpetrators of units involved in adulteration and falsification, as well as leaders and individuals who support, cover up, or tolerate such behavior, administrative sanctions must be imposed. For serious cases that constitute a crime, they must be promptly handed over to the public security and judicial authorities for legal action.

4. For cases of adulteration and falsification reported by users, relevant departments at all levels, such as industry and commerce administration, technical supervision, and commodity inspection, must quickly organize forces to investigate and handle them. Those who report true cases must be commended and rewarded. For those who use various means to retaliate against informants, they must be severely punished in accordance with the "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Severely Punishing Serious Economic Crimes."

5. All production, procurement, storage, domestic sales, and foreign trade export units must take effective measures to strictly control and prevent adulteration and falsification in goods. Those who procure or sell adulterated or falsified goods will be treated as if they themselves were involved in adulteration and falsification.

Coal gangue is only allowed to be sold to departments and enterprises approved by the competent authorities for comprehensive utilization and is not allowed to be sold to other units and individuals. Violators will be handled by the industry and commerce administrative management departments.

6. For units and individuals involved in adulteration and falsification, as well as those who support, cover up, or tolerate such behavior, if they voluntarily confess after the issuance of this notice, they will be treated leniently. Those who continue to engage in adulteration and falsification will be severely punished.

The State Council emphasizes that severely cracking down on the practice of adulterating and falsifying goods is an important measure to improve the economic environment and rectify economic order. All provincial, autonomous region, and municipal people's governments, and relevant departments of the State Council must attach great importance to this, closely cooperate, take practical and effective measures, and seriously implement the provisions of this notice. They must focus on key areas, quickly break through, and swiftly stop the practice of adulterating and falsifying goods, severely cracking down on such speculative and fraudulent activities.

　　国务院通知各地各部门
　　严厉打击商品掺杂使假行为
　　要求全面检查一经查实从重处罚
    新华社北京9月11日电　国务院近日发出通知，要求各地区、各部门严厉打击在商品中掺杂使假的行为。
    国务院指出，最近一个时期，一些从事生产、收购、储运、国内经销、外贸出口的单位和个人，无视国家法律、法规，明目张胆地在商品中掺杂使假，牟取暴利。有的竟把掺杂使假当成一种“发财致富”的专门职业，甚至开办掺假制假的企业。目前，掺假商品之多，手段之恶劣，已到了令人发指的地步。掺假商品不仅严重危害工农业生产，使国民经济受到极大损失，而且破坏了国家和企业的信誉，严重损害了消费者的利益，有的甚至危及人身安全，已引起广大群众的强烈不满。对这种掺杂使假的投机倒把行为，必须坚决制止，严厉打击。
    国务院为此通知如下：
    一、各级人民政府和国务院各有关部门要立即组织工商行政、技术监督、商检、公安、外贸、物资、商业和生产主管部门，分赴生产、收购、储运、国内经销、工业用户和外贸出口等单位和场所，对商品掺杂使假问题进行一次全面检查。发现有掺杂使假商品的单位和个人，要责令其立即停业，接受审查。
    二、对查证属实的掺杂使假单位和个人，由有关部门按各自的职责分工，依照《投机倒把行政处罚暂行条例》和国务院办公厅转发的国家技术监督局《关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者的意见》等有关文件的规定从重给予处罚。对情节严重的，要吊销其营业执照。掺杂使假商品已销出的，要没收全部销货款，并从重处以罚款，销货款已挪作他用的，可没收其财产抵缴罚没款；未销出的掺杂使假商品，要予以没收，并从重处以罚款。对掺杂使假单位和个人在银行的存款，工商行政管理机关有权按照规定程序查询、冻结；对拒绝缴纳罚没款的可强行划拨。
    报验出口的掺杂使假商品，由国家商检部门按有关规定处罚。
    三、对掺杂使假单位的主管人员和直接责任人员，以及支持、包庇、纵容掺杂使假行为的领导人与责任者，要给予行政处分；对情节严重构成犯罪的，要及时移送公安、司法机关依法查办。
    四、对用户举报的掺杂使假案件，各级工商行政、技术监督和商检等有关部门要组织力量迅速查处。对举报属实的要给予表彰和奖励。对采用种种手段打击报复举报者的，要依照《全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于严惩严重破坏经济的罪犯的决定》从重惩处。
    五、所有生产、收购、储运、国内经销、外贸出口单位，都要采取有效措施，严格把关，严防在商品中掺杂使假。对收购、销售掺杂使假商品的，可视同掺杂使假行为处理。
    煤矿的煤矸石只允许售给经主管部门批准的综合利用部门和企业，不得售给其他单位和个人，违者由工商行政管理机关查处。
    六、对掺杂使假的单位和个人，以及支持、包庇、纵容者，凡在本通知发出后主动坦白交待的，从宽处理，仍进行掺杂使假的，从重处罚。
    国务院强调，严厉打击在商品中掺杂使假的行为，是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的一项重要措施。各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府和国务院各有关部门，要高度重视，密切配合，采取切实有力措施，认真贯彻执行本通知的各项规定，要抓住重点，尽快突破，迅速制止在商品中掺杂使假，严厉打击这类投机倒把活动。
