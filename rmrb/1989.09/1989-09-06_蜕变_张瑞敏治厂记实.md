Before a cicada dies, it painfully inserts its slender tail into the living tree branches to lay its eggs. The branches carrying the eggs wither and fall to the ground with the autumn wind. Some eggs are buried by snow, others are washed away by rain, and some manage to enter the soil, beginning their arduous journey of life. The eggs hatch into larvae, which absorb the nutrients from the soil and roots, enduring three winters and five summers before maturing into cicada nymphs. When the summer thunder roars and the rain calls, the cicada nymphs emerge from their underground "prisons" at night, avoiding the venomous tongues of snakes and the greedy mouths of toads, crawling up the tree trunks. They writhe, struggle, and faint; their backs split, claws emerge, shells shed, and wings unfold... Finally, a cicada covered in dirt transforms into a cicada that sings loudly. As children, we watched cicadas molt for fun, not to seek any philosophical meaning. As we grew older, textbooks told us that the cicada's nightly transformation is just one of its many stages of life. Before this, it had already undergone five metamorphoses in the soil's purgatory...

There are 14,000 species of butterflies in the world. Swallowtails, skippers, satyrs, whites, blues, hairstreaks, fritillaries, and admirals... the list goes on. They are all ugly caterpillars before they become beautiful butterflies. The caterpillars inside the chrysalises tremble and bite their way out, creating a path to life, and then transform into butterflies that flutter among the flowers. There is also a vast family of birds. They chirp and sing, forming a chorus in nature. However, their predecessors were all eggs without any cracks. When the temperature is suitable, the fertilized eggs will hatch into chicks. The chicks, in their confusion, use their tender beaks to peck open the eggshells, gaining the freedom to embrace the blue sky...

Encased eggs fly out as flowing poetry, ugly chrysalises reveal colorful paintings, and dirty cicada nymphs sing beautiful songs. Metamorphosis is a marvel of life, a tribute to beauty!

In the year of the Snake, we arrived in Qingdao to interview the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory, which had just won the national refrigerator competition. In the past, when people talked about Qingdao, they would first mention the world-famous Qingdao Beer. Today, "Qingdao" - Liebherr has taken the lead in the competition, further spreading the fame of Qingdao. However, who would have known that this "national flower" that everyone envies was originally a bud that bloomed in the thorny thicket of small-scale production. As we followed the path of the pioneers' memories to pick up the petals of reform, we were amazed to discover that just four years ago, this modern factory was in such a state of chaos. It was as similar to the sealed eggs, ugly chrysalises, and dirt-covered cicada nymphs as could be!

In 1984, the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory changed its director four times within a year: the first one failed to turn the situation around and resigned; the second one was powerless to change the situation and quickly withdrew; the third one came and went in a hurry, barely warming the seat; the fourth one arrived late in the winter, and he was Zhang Ruimin.

At the age of 35, Zhang Ruimin was elegant and tall, standing at about 1.8 meters, with a well-proportioned build. His broad face was as smooth as powder, and his bright eyes shone with a light. His speech and mannerisms were calm and steady, revealing an inner charm. Despite his scholarly appearance and the fact that some people knew he was an outstanding deputy manager of the Second Light Industry Bureau's Electrical Appliance Company, his arrival did not light up the eyes of the people.

At that time, the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory was a name in vain. Facing the dazzling market neon lights, the factory was like a cicada that would fly towards the light and crash into the brightness. It first produced hair dryers and electric hoists on a whim; then, on a whim, it produced electric fans and washing machines; seeing that donkeys were not ridden, it then tinkered with the "Xueyue" brand refrigerator... Imitating others led to a mountain of debt, and following others led to borrowing from the future. When Zhang Ruimin took over, the entire factory had debts of 1.6 million yuan, and the 800-plus employees had empty pockets. The documents on Zhang Ruimin's desk were not production progress reports, but 76 requests for transfers... The factory was in such a state of chaos: workers playing cards, chess, and knitting during work hours were considered "law-abiding," and fights, drunken behavior, and theft occurred frequently; the rusty doors of the warehouses were filled with old products, becoming a paradise for rats to play...

Zhang Ruimin was scared and intimidated. To be honest, when he took over as the director, he was full of ambition. He participated in the project to introduce the German Liebherr, as a member of the inspection team, he had been to the Federal Republic of Germany. In the hometown of Marx and Einstein, he received a true baptism of large-scale production... Later, he participated in the comparison and inspection of technology and products from 32 foreign refrigeration factories, and in three meetings, he strongly advocated for the introduction of Liebherr... He was determined to do this! However, to make that ideal cloud descend upon this real marshland was like a dream!

The current refrigerator factory was like a cicada nymph covered in historical filth. To make it undergo a metamorphosis from small-scale to large-scale production, the first step was not to climb trees and branches, but to make it crawl out of the "prison" and shake off the dirt. To cure this chaotic factory, Zhang Ruimin first prescribed a "pediatric" management formula. He convened a meeting of section chiefs and above, establishing 13 factory regulations. The 13 regulations were basically about what was not allowed and what the punishment would be if violated, like children singing "Sit in a row, eat fruit" in kindergarten. However, even these basic factory regulations were difficult to implement. The day after they were posted, two young workers dared to challenge the rules: one young worker hit someone, leaving them with a bruised face and blood all over; another young worker was even bolder, stealing factory materials in broad daylight...

At 11 AM, the news of the incident reached Zhang Ruimin, who called a leadership meeting at noon. By 2 PM, the decision to punish the offenders was prominently displayed at the factory gate...

The principle of rewarding and punishing was clear, and the "13 prohibitions" were firm. In the hearts of the numb people, a wave of hope resonated. It was then that people carefully looked at their director: who would have thought that this reserved and elegant scholar had such a firm hand!

Zhang Ruimin's "small test" made the factory initially return to order, but to complete the introduction of Liebherr, there were still 81 difficulties. According to the introduction contract, 17 production lines of equipment had been shipped from Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and experts were about to set off for China. The introduction project was about to begin. Chickens cannot give birth to camels, and the demolition and reconstruction of old factory buildings were urgent, as was the auction of old equipment. When the factory decided on this necessary measure, many people who were used to the old ways immediately panicked. Zhang Ruimin, who had just established some authority among the workers, suddenly became the "wasteful son" in the eyes of those who were used to the old ways...

The head of the equipment department came in, displeased: "Director, someone doesn't want to sell the old equipment, this..."

"Auction. Two-month deadline."

The head of the supply department rushed in: "Director, the old products are too expensive to sell, what do you think..."

"Reduce the price. Two-month deadline."

The head of the construction department looked troubled: "Director, there is too much resistance to demolishing the old factory, this..."

"Demolish. Two-month deadline."

Zhang Ruimin stood above all, his calm words were orders that could not be questioned.

Truck after truck roared into the factory, old equipment and old products were thrown into the trucks amid curses; bulldozers roared, and the ruins collapsed with a crash. The toothed buckets were like huge, ferocious claws, tearing at the hearts of the people. Old workers bid a sorrowful farewell to this ruthless burial... At this time, Zhang Ruimin's face was calm, but his heart was like a volcano erupting. He understood the feelings of the people, especially the old workers. The predecessor of this factory was a few small handicraft repair shops. This property was earned by mending pots, repairing locks, making buckets, welding teapots, and rolling cigarette holders. Today, it was all gone, how could it not touch the nerves of the people? But understanding did not mean yielding. To tolerate the "miserly" mentality of small-scale production was to desecrate the "time is money" concept of large-scale production. Time, Zhang Ruimin and Liebherr needed time the most. Time, for our nation, was already too little, and the tangled knots of reality were too many...

Ignoring praise and blame, Zhang Ruimin tightly grasped the reins of time and rushed forward on the track of his career.

On the eve of the New Year in 1985, Zhang Ruimin bid farewell to his elderly mother and children and hurriedly boarded a southbound train, heading straight for Changsha. The engineering drawings from the Changsha Design Institute had not yet been born, and Zhang Ruimin came to "induce labor." The spirit of the entrepreneur moved the designers, and they sacrificed their precious Spring Festival rest time, working day and night in the design room... On the fifth day of the New Year, a blueprint was placed in Zhang Ruimin's briefcase... From the decision to introduce to the start of construction, Zhang Ruimin and the leaders of the Second Light Industry Bureau in charge of the introduction visited 53 departments, wrote 152 reports, and signed 184 contracts. In the rigid, overlapping, and self-serving system, they fought for speed and won time. Who could understand the bitterness?

The people of the Refrigerator Factory saw only that the outwardly calm Zhang Ruimin had started a time-saving whirlwind—

Like cicada nymphs emerging from the ground, like caterpillars breaking out of their chrysalises, like chicks hatching from their eggs, a modern factory had taken shape. The factory buildings built into the mountain emitted the freshness of the years, and the assembly lines in the young chest of the mountain had already roared with intoxication... The resentment caused by the relocation and auction melted and disappeared in this roar... Who would have thought that another sudden event would strike the hearts of the people, and Zhang Ruimin's image would become blurred and hazy again.

The incident was triggered by a letter from a user. The letter criticized the factory's "Xueyue" brand refrigerator for being of poor quality. Zhang Ruimin immediately ordered an inspection of the stored "Xueyue" refrigerators, and the results were shocking: 76 units had quality problems.

That day, the sky was overcast and heavy. The entire factory suddenly received an order to stop work and assemble. 76 "Xueyue" refrigerators were lined up in front of the people, and large hammers leaned against them, tightly gripping the attention of more than a thousand pairs of eyes. Suddenly, the noisy factory area was silent, and time seemed to have frozen. "Smash!" Zhang Ruimin ordered in a low voice.

"Director!" A call, filled with concentrated pain. More than a thousand pairs of eyes shot towards Zhang Ruimin: accusation, resentment, anger, confusion, pleading... all merged into a nuclear fission-like wave of spiritual impact, threatening to collapse the dam Zhang Ruimin had built in his heart.

At this moment, a hidden corner of Zhang Ruimin's heart was engaged in a fierce struggle. Facing the 76 "Xueyue" refrigerators, he understood better than anyone else their value in the hearts of the Chinese people. In the hearts of the Chinese people, who had once been impoverished, the refrigerator, this high-end household appliance, despite its quality problems, should not be smashed... People could not accept the destruction in front of them. However, the refrigerator factory needed to challenge the poor results of small-scale production and traditional attitudes. At the factory meeting, someone suggested selling these defective products at a discount to the factory workers. In the unanimous approval, he had hesitated. Frankly, he had also lingered and bought at the "export turned to domestic sales" and "product price reduction" counters and stalls. Blessing or disaster? Sadness or joy?... He overruled the unanimous opinion and barely managed to arrange the solemn scene in front of him. At this moment, facing more than a thousand pairs of pitying eyes, facing these people who produced refrigerators but had never experienced the wonders of a refrigerator, his resolve wavered.

"Director!" Another call.

Zhang Ruimin was startled. He was afraid that time would erode his resolve, so he suddenly clenched his right fist and fiercely pressed it down, squeezing out a word from his teeth: "Smash!"

One hammer after another slowly rose, rose...

Bang! Bang! Bang!... Like the cicada nymph's back splitting, more than a thousand eyes tightly closed, and people only felt their backs trembling and their hearts aching...

The dull sound of the hammers rang out, rang out. The remnants of small-scale production management were left in front, and the quality consciousness of large-scale production in the 1980s was awakened.

In the atmosphere created by the heavy blows, in June 1985, the first generation of four-star refrigerators, "Qingdao" - Liebherr, flowed out of the assembly line in China...

Time quickly spoke for Zhang Ruimin. For every day the construction period was shortened, 150,000 yuan of output value could be earned...

The high-level introduction revived the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory, which was on the brink of collapse, and the grafting of Western industrial civilization made this marshland bright and beautiful. But Zhang Ruimin did not indulge in self-satisfaction. As the German experts left for their country, his every nerve became more tense. He understood his team too well. Smashing the "Xueyue" refrigerators could only ring the alarm bell for quality consciousness, but it could not fundamentally change the quality of the team. The factory's masters were all craftsmen of various trades, and the new workers had not been tempered by large-scale production. Small-scale and large-scale production were worlds apart. In the past, Wang Ma's scissors, Dog's Not Eating Noodles, and Dezhou Braised Chicken... these representatives of small-scale production were only the individuality of the people, while large-scale production must incorporate individual wills and actions into group norms. Zhang Ruimin knew that this team was at best a guerrilla force of small-scale production, far from being a regular army of large-scale production. To change it, he must equip it with science and knowledge.

So, Zhang Ruimin decided to, at all costs, let all the workers of the factory undergo training in 20 sessions; non-stop, tiered training was held at any time. Zhang Ruimin was a scholar-type director. He graduated from high school in 1968 and was a top student in a provincial key high school. Cruel history blocked his path to higher education, but as a worker, he dared to struggle with fate. The heavy burden of labor did not fatigue his hungry soul for knowledge. He persevered in deciphering the unknowns wrapped in hard shells that his peers feared, and finally, he became self-taught and obtained a college diploma. In the past few years, he was often invited by some factories to teach enterprise management courses, and his management articles were published in newspapers. But after the introduction of Liebherr, he felt more and more the lack of knowledge. As the director of a factory, he had no time to study with the workers, but whenever he invited experts and professors to the factory to hold high-level lectures, he would never miss the opportunity. Seeing the director humbly learning, the workers also secretly followed suit... New knowledge and dense information made people discard the Asian workshops and leap over Taylor's "standard management," chasing after Naisbitt's "Megatrends" and accepting Toffler's "Future Shock"... Through one training session after another, what needed to be settled was settled, and what needed to be elevated was elevated. Like the new feathers of a bird struggling in the sky, they gradually became full as the old feathers fell off...

In sync with the workers' training, Zhang Ruimin and his deputies began to establish a management mechanism that was ten times more difficult than the introduction of Liebherr. Through the introduction, digestion, and absorption of advanced foreign management experience, they gradually perfected a set of management regulations with two thousand items and a million words. "Qingdao" - Liebherr's 290 processes could not escape this document's monitoring, and 171 components could not escape this document's scanning. Small-scale production's sloppiness and randomness could not find a single excuse, and those in power could no longer speak nonsense in the face of this document. Everything was "within the rules," and no one could be "an exception"...

In the past, when production accidents occurred in the factory, the factory department became an "emergency room." With this all-encompassing document, the workshops and teams became "health stations," and each worker could "take their pulse" and "take medicine." Every production process had a case to refer to, and every product put on the market had a number. If a problem occurred, it was fed back, and the production records were checked, making everything clear. No one could hide anything...

A young worker forgot to prepare the materials for the next day's production when he got off the night shift, causing the next day's work to be delayed. The division leader came to investigate the responsibility according to the document.

"You..."

"I admit my mistake and accept the punishment." The young worker stood with his head down.

"Do you know the amount of the fine?"

"I calculated it according to the document, it should be around 400 yuan." The young worker's heart was torn.

"The fine is 463 yuan and 2 jiao. Can you accept it?"

"To say it hurts, it does. But even Zhang Ruimin, the director, is not exempt, so what can I say..." The young worker accepted the lesson in a long cough, seemingly finding a way out.

Everyone in the factory knew that Zhang Ruimin had fined himself twice and publicly announced it. When smashing the "Xueyue" refrigerators, he heavily fined himself; in the recent quality management strengthening activity, the factory department made a small mistake, and he deducted his entire month's bonus.

"Director's fine is really unfair. Cough..." The young worker accepted the lesson in a long cough, seemingly finding a way out.

The market for products is like a magic cube, with the magic cube constantly changing, only high-quality products can play with the magic cube in the palm of your hand; the market for products is like a vast sea, with the sea full of tricks, only high-quality products can play in the troughs and crests of the sea waves. The high quality born of strict scientific management made "Qingdao" - Liebherr, once it was born, it was favored by the market. Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing... one wave after another of "Qingdao" fever swept through...

Was it the elegant and charming appearance that made people envious? Perhaps. The designer understood the mentality of the Chinese people. In developed countries, refrigerators are purely household items, often placed in kitchens or storage rooms. However, our vain compatriots treat them as showpieces. "Qingdao" - Liebherr's jade-white body is adorned with a pair of bare-chested Chinese and German children, resembling the ever-smiling Laughing Buddha. Qingdao people affectionately call "Liebherr" the "child that cannot be parted with." Once this child enters a family, the cluttered and cramped room will immediately be filled with joy... Was it the soaring prices that made it a hot item? Perhaps. Since "storing gold and silver is not as good as storing a piano" has been repeatedly proven, people are not easily deceived again. When accepting historical lessons, people are perhaps too passive...

Of course, the "Qingdao" fever also has its core, that is its outstanding quality. Its opening rate has always been 100%, and there has never been a single compensation incident; the repair rate is below 4‰ (far below the 2% standard set by the Ministry of Light Industry), reaching the world's advanced level; in June 1987, 15 famous brands of refrigerators from the United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, and China participated in the second refrigerator bidding activity organized by the World Health Organization and the International Bank Investment, it defeated the world's heroes and won the bid...

The Chinese people looked at "Qingdao" with new eyes, and foreigners were amazed by "Qingdao." 60-plus reporters from 48 countries came to the factory for a special visit, and after returning to their countries, they wrote articles praising "Qingdao" one after another. The German ambassador to China, Mr. Pei Peiyi, also came to Qingdao to see the true face of Mount Lu. Perhaps this China expert was familiar with the Chinese people's familiar "flowery stick" skills, and he came as a surprise. The banquet prepared by the city was firmly declined by him, and he drove straight to the factory. After he looked around inside and out without showing any emotion, he was deeply moved. In front of Zhang Ruimin, he shook his thumb:

"Good! Good! This is the first one I've seen in China!" There was also a foreign expert who came to the factory for a more detailed inspection. Before leaving, he patted Zhang Ruimin's shoulder, not without humor, and said: "OK, OK, management waltz!"

Managing a modern factory is not as easy as dancing, but if this expert's praise is a bit of an exaggeration, then the thousand-word management regulations of the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory are the sheet music for this "waltz." According to this "sheet music," the factory leadership team worked in harmony, each doing their part. Zhang Ruimin was not dancing alone; he and his deputies were all "lead dancers"...

From managing "pediatrics" to managing "waltz," the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory underwent a difficult metamorphosis, metamorphosis... When the auspicious birds brought songs of praise and the butterflies brought honors, Zhang Ruimin did not indulge in joy. The second phase of the introduction project was being implemented, and the varieties of products were constantly being updated. The factory had already implemented computer management, and the requirements for people's quality were higher. Small-scale production only recognized "hardware" and did not recognize "software," and the evil roots of worshipping skills and not cherishing knowledge needed to be eradicated from the root. Any relaxation would make this joyful "waltz" end in a broken tune. Blood transfusion, Zhang Ruimin had long been paying attention to the transfusion of this team. The factory already had 200 technical personnel with college and vocational education, but he still felt it was not enough. In the summer of 1988, he rushed to recruit talents before the university students were assigned. Top students from Harbin Institute of Technology came, top students from Shanghai Jiaotong University came, and outstanding students from Xi'an Jiaotong University and Shandong University also came... The factory's canteen was under construction, and the workers, including the big and small bosses of the factory, were eating in the workshops and offices, while a sign was prominently displayed on the side of the temporary kitchen - University Student Dining Hall. Some workers did not think much of it: the university students had just entered the factory and had not done anything, receiving such favor was a bit too much. Zhang Ruimin sighed: "In the past, when Napoleon invaded Egypt, he issued a strange order, 'Let the donkey scholars walk in the middle!' That was respecting scholars! Even a fierce warrior knew how to respect knowledge, let alone us..." Then, he spent a lot of money to buy dormitories for the university students, and the dormitories were equipped with TVs, refrigerators, desks, and lamps by the government... The factory had thousands of rules, and the newly arrived university students inevitably felt a sense of restraint. But soon they discovered that Zhang Ruimin, who had the demeanor of an elder brother, strictly enforced the rules to strive for excellence, but never bullied people. There was no trace of the "feudal lord" style that this generation of university students hated, and he made people feel that he seemed to be inviting you to do a great cause that the Chinese people should have done long ago but had not done...

Talent follows the tool, and the university students quickly found their place in life. In October 1988, the factory had an unfortunate incident: a unit in Beijing that cooperated with the Refrigerator Factory wanted to strangle the factory's neck. If they did not agree to their increasingly demanding conditions, they would mess up or take away the PC programmable controllers provided to the workshop, causing the equipment to stop. At present, this kind of "internal friction" in our country is indeed common, but this time it did not work. When the people from the Beijing unit took away the programmable controllers for two days, on the third day, they came to the factory again, full of confidence, thinking that the factory would obediently submit. Who would have thought that when they entered the workshop, they saw the machines running smoothly. It turned out that the university students had worked day and night, deciphered the mysterious program codes, and reinstalled the new programmable controllers. The visitors saw this and left dejectedly...

1988 was a year when the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory was in the limelight: it first won the "Best Reputation Cup" at the National Refrigerator Exhibition, and took the only "Quality Management Award" in the national refrigerator industry. Then, in the United Nations Children's Fund refrigerator bidding, it won the championship, becoming the only factory in China and the only one to win the bid twice in the international refrigerator bidding. It made 70% of the factory's products exported to 20 countries and regions... On December 1, it was a day that the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory was particularly proud of. The results of the national excellence competition were announced, and "Qingdao" - Liebherr won the "Queen" throne, winning the first gold medal in the history of Chinese refrigerators!

At the end of the year of the Dragon, the workers of the factory were excitedly looking forward to the celebration meeting. The glow of the gold medal dazzled the eyes, and the full pockets made people feel like they were floating. The chief accountant pressed the computer, and the output value increased by 79.2% compared to last year, and the taxes increased by 96%... The second phase of the project was about to be completed, and the output value of 500 million yuan in 1989 was guaranteed... These were astronomical figures that people did not dare to think about four years ago! That day, the workers received a notice that the factory meeting would be held at the Qingdao Theater, and the joyful mood instantly boiled over. Young female workers lightly applied makeup and dressed up, and young male workers groomed themselves and dressed neatly. When people sat down in the theater with sincere emotions, they suddenly realized that the luxurious theater stage had no celebration banners hanging in the middle, and there were no bands on both sides.

The usually calm Zhang Ruimin seemed a bit excited, and his powdered face was flushed with pink spots... People vaguely felt that something was wrong. The meeting began, first with a deputy director reading a letter from a user, and then with the chief engineer representing the factory department announcing the decision to punish 19 cadres and workers...

The venue was as silent as a graveyard, and the boiling point of excitement suddenly cooled into frozen ice. The root of the matter was: a user in Qingdao bought a "Qingdao" refrigerator, and there was a speck of dirt inside the cabinet. The user went to the factory's maintenance department to demand a refund, but the receptionist shifted the blame, using the fact that the user did not open the box at the time of purchase to raise objections...

Zhang Ruimin received the user's letter and immediately decided to punish according to the factory's rules. The speck of dirt involved 19 people from production, sales to maintenance. The one with the bad attitude was naturally the heaviest punishment - the title of "Advanced Worker of the Factory" was canceled, and he was "exiled" to the factory labor market, waiting for optimization...

In the midst of confusion, Zhang Ruimin left his seat and spoke passionately: "I know that winning the gold medal has injected a joyful force into the factory. But the joyful force can both inspire new creations and make the small-scale production's diseases of self-satisfaction, stagnation, narrow-mindedness, and arrogance emerge. Have we really covered our heads?" He swung his right hand in the air, "No! Winning the national excellence is only the 'National Games' gold medal, our goal is to march towards the 'Olympic Games' gold medal!"

The cicada molts six times before it can sing loudly. At this moment, Zhang Ruimin used the keys of his powerful language to pluck the trembling strings of people's hearts, producing an echo in the valley. This sound, accompanied by the hum of the bulldozers pushing down the old nests and the smashing of the "Xueyue" refrigerators, was once again engraved on the echo wall of large-scale production consciousness, leaving indelible notes...

The lights came on, and we wandered on the stone paths of this coastal city, lost in thought. Qingdao, a microcosm of modern Chinese history, a city built with stones of national humiliation. Nearly a hundred years ago, there were only a few thatched cottages and a few fishing families here. It was the foreign invaders' gunboats and cannons that made it a German concession, and it was the Germans who built the Jiaoji Railway, crushing its gentle fishing songs. Ruthless destruction accompanied miraculous creation. Crazy plunder left historical gifts. This Eastern Venice was born in passive pain. Today, those gunboats and cannons have turned into software and computers, forcing our nation to undergo a proactive metamorphosis. If the Qingdao Beer, with its 86-year history, is the fragrance that overflows from the national blood, then "Qingdao" - Liebherr is a masterpiece born from a difficult metamorphosis. Passive and active differ by only one word, and both are equally painful, but the content of the pain is completely different. Only proactive metamorphosis can prevent passive annihilation. May thousands of Zhang Ruimins appear on this land, and may the "waltz" of management lead the entire nation, correcting the chaotic steps...

    蜕变
    ——张瑞敏治厂记实
    李存葆　王光明
    雌蝉谢世前，痛苦地将纤细的尾针刺入鲜活的树枝内，产播下生命的种子。带卵的枝条伴着秋风枯萎了，堕地了。抑或大雪压埋，抑或暴雨冲淋，便有部分蝉卵投进泥土，开始了艰难的生的里程。卵变幼虫，幼虫吸地气啜根液，历三冬经五暑，始发育为成熟的蝉猴儿。当惊雷炸响夏雨呼唤时，蝉猴儿夜出“地牢”，躲过毒蛇阴险的舔舐，避开蛤蟆贪婪的口腔，蠕动着爬上了树干。抽搐、挣扎、昏死；裂背、探爪、脱壳、舒翼……终于，一个沾满污秽的泥猴儿蜕变为乐声聒耳的蝉。儿时，我们夜窥蝉蜕，乃稚趣使然，倒不是探寻什么哲理；年龄及长，教科书告诉我们，蝉猴儿夤夜间的变异，仅是一次生的翔舞，而在此之前，它在泥土的炼狱里已经有过五次蜕变……
    世上万千生灵的诞生都是那般痛不堪言，而异体蜕变恐为甚之。世上蝴蝶凡14000种。凤蝶、弄蝶、绢蝶、粉蝶、环蝶、灰蝶、蛱蝶、斑蝶……不胜枚举，它们穷形尽相，各臻其致，雄飞雌从，竞相媲美，然而，它们的前身则都是丑不可睹的蛹。蛹中成虫抖颤着咬破蛹皮，噬啃出一条生路，才变为穿花度丛的彩蝶。世上还有一个庞杂的鸟的家族，它们呢呢喃喃，千鸣百啭，组成了一支支大自然的合唱队，然而，它们的前体则都为毫无缝隙的蛋。温度适宜时，受过精的蛋会孵化出鸟雏儿，鸟雏儿在混沌中用其稚嫩的喙啼血啄开蛋壳，才获得了拥抱蓝天的自由……
    封闭的蛋飞出流动的诗，丑陋的蛹现出五彩的画，猥琐的泥猴儿唱出美妙的歌，异体蜕变是生的奇观，美的礼赞！
    蛇年初度，我们来到青岛，采访刚刚在全国电冰箱评比中折桂的青岛电冰箱总厂。往昔，提及青岛，人们总是首先谈起蜚声中外的青岛啤酒，今日，琴岛——利勃海尔在角逐中独占鳌头，更使青岛芳名远播。然而，谁人知道，“琴岛”这朵令人艳羡的“国花”，原是在小生产的荆棘丛中绽开花蕾的。当我们沿着开拓者记忆的小径，去俯拾改革的花瓣时，才惊诧地发现，仅在四年前，这座现代化的工厂还是那般混沌未开，它与那封闭之蛋，丑陋之蛹，周身沾满泥垢的蝉猴儿又何其相似！
    1984年一年内，青岛电冰箱总厂高频律更选厂长：一任难挽危局，挂冠而去；二任回天无力，急流告退；三任匆匆来去，席不暇暖；第四任于隆冬时节姗姗来迟，他，就是张瑞敏。
    时年35岁的张瑞敏风度翩翩，一米八几的身材，结构匀称，宽宽的脸膛，面如敷粉，一双明亮的大眼透着光芒，言谈举止，平和沉稳，显出内在的魅力。尽管他有儒雅之士的丰采，尽管也有人知道他原是市二轻局家电公司出类拔萃的副经理，但他的到任，并没有燃亮人们的眼睛。
    当时的青岛电冰箱总厂徒有虚名。面对眼花缭乱的市场霓虹灯，这个厂曾像夜栖之蝉，见光就飞，见亮就撞。一时兴起，先是生产吹风机，电葫芦；心血来潮，又上了电风扇，洗衣机；见马不骑驴，接着又鼓捣瑞雪牌电冰箱……东施效颦引来债台高筑，邯郸学步导致寅吃卯粮。张瑞敏到任时，全厂已负债160万元，800余名职工钱袋羞涩。堆在张瑞敏案头的不是生产进度表，而是76份申请调离的报告……厂里的一切是那样杂乱无章：上班时打扑克下象棋织毛衣的工人算是
  “守法户”，打架斗殴酗酒盗窃时有发生；锈门闭户的仓库里堆着横三叉四的旧产品，早已成为黠鼠恣意寻欢的乐园……
    张瑞敏心怯了，胆寒了。老实说，在就任厂长之时，他曾踌躇满志。他参入了引进联邦德国利勃海尔的立项，作为考察团的成员，曾到过联邦德国。在马克思和爱因斯坦的故乡，他接受了一次真正的大生产的洗礼……后来他又参与对国外32个制冷厂家技术和产品的对比、考察，在三次论证会上，他力主引进利勃海尔……他就是冲着这项引进来的！然而，要让那理想的彩云降临这片现实的沼泽地，又不啻是痴人说梦！
    眼下的电冰箱厂，如一只沾满历史浊秽的蝉猴儿，要让它完成由小生产到大生产的蜕变，第一步不是爬树登枝，而是让它钻出“地牢”，抖掉污垢。为医治这乱糟糟的厂子，张瑞敏首先开的是“小儿科”的管理处方。他召开了车间主任以上的干部会议，确立了13条治厂法规。13条无非是这不准那不准，违者如何如何，好像幼儿园的孩童唱“排排座，吃果果”一般。可这起码的治厂法规，付诸实施竟也是那样艰难。它贴出的第二天，便有两位青工敢撞“枪口”：一青工动手打人，将人打得鼻青脸肿，血乎淋拉；另一青工胆子更大，于光天化日之下偷盗厂里的物资……上午11时，作案的消息报到张瑞敏处，12时张瑞敏召开厂领导会议，下午两点，处理肇事者的决定便豁然醒目地贴在厂门口……
    信赏必罚，“13条不准”掷地有声，在人们麻木的心谷里荡起希望的回响。这时人们才仔细抬眼端量他们的厂长：想不到这含而不露的儒雅之士，手腕还真有点硬呢！
    张瑞敏“牛刀小试”，使工厂初步走向正规，但要完成利勃海尔的引进，还有九九八十一难。按照引进合同，17条生产线的设备，已从联邦德国巴登斯登州启运，专家也将登程来华。引进工程破土在即。鸡窝里生不出骆驼，拆除、改造旧厂房迫在眉睫，拍卖旧设备刻不容缓。当厂部作出这势在必行的决策后，全厂许多习惯守旧摊子的人顿时炸了营。刚刚在工人中树起些许威信的张瑞敏，转瞬成了邓氏友梅笔下的败家子
  “那五”……
    设备科的头头悻悻而至：“厂长，那旧设备有人不让卖，这……”
      “拍卖。限期两个月。”
    供销科的首脑匆匆跑来：“厂长，那旧产品贵了卖不出，你看……”
      “削价。限期两个月。”
    基建科的负责人面有难色：“厂长，拆旧厂房阻力太大，那……”
      “扒掉。限期两个月。”
    张瑞敏君临一切，平静的话语里是不容置疑的指令。
    一辆辆大卡车鸣叫着开进厂内，旧设备、旧产品在人们的咒骂声中投进车箱；推土机吼叫着，断壁残垣应声而倒，那带齿的钢斗犹如只只硕大凶残的魔爪，在撕扯着人们的五脏六腑，老工人以悲怆的泪水凭吊着这无情的埋葬……斯时斯地斯情斯景，面部平和的张瑞敏心中似有地火奔突。他理解人们尤其是老工人的情感。这个厂的前体是几个小手工业修理社，这份家当是人们补盆、修锁、打桶、焊铁壶、卷烟筒挣下的，今朝一古脑儿连锅端，怎不牵动人们的末梢神经？但理解并不等于苟同，对小生产“守财奴”意识的迁就，则是对大生产“时间就是金钱”观念的亵渎。时间，张瑞敏和利勃海尔眼下最需要的是时间。时间，属于我们这个民族的已是太少太少，而“剪不断，理还乱”的现实中的死结又是太多太多……
    毁誉荣辱，抛置脑后，张瑞敏紧紧抓住时间的缰绳，在事业的轨道上迅跑。
    1985年除夕。张瑞敏惜别老母、妻儿，急匆匆踏上南下列车，直赴长沙。由长沙设计院设计的工程图纸尚未出世，张瑞敏前来“催生”。创业者的精神感动了设计者，他们牺牲宝贵的春节休息时间，埋头在设计室里，日夜赶制……正月初五，一纸蓝图装进了张瑞敏的手提箱……从确定引进到破土动工的那段时间里，张瑞敏和二轻局分管引进的领导，足及53个部门，打书面报告152份，签合同184张，在板结、重叠而又相互扯皮的体制中，争得速度，赢得时间，个中滋味，谁能体察？电冰箱总厂的人们看到的仅是，外表沉稳的张瑞敏刮起了抢时间的旋风——
    像蝉猴儿出土，似蝶虫儿破蛹，若鸟雏儿脱壳，一座现代化的工厂已现雏形。那劈山而建的厂房旁，青冽的石茬散发着岁月的清新，流水线在大山年轻的胸膛里已发出醉人的吼声……因拆迁、拍卖引起的怨恨在这吼声中溶化、消失……谁知，一个突发事件又重创了人们的心，倏忽间，张瑞敏的形象又变得模糊、朦胧了。
    事情是由一用户来信引起的。信中谴责该厂生产的“瑞雪”牌电冰箱质量低劣。张瑞敏当即派人对库存的“瑞雪”进行严格检查，结果令人惊骇：有76台存有质量问题。
    这天，天阴得均匀而沉重。全厂职工突然接到停工集合的命令。76台“瑞雪”一字摆在人们面前，一把把大锤斜倚其上，紧紧攫住了千余双目光。霎时，喧闹的厂区静得怕人，时间也似乎凝固了。“砸！”张瑞敏低声命令道。
      “厂长！”一声呼唤，带着浓缩的痛楚。千余双目光射向张瑞敏：责备、怨恨、愤懑、茫然、乞求……汇成一股核裂变般的心灵冲击波，欲要冲塌张瑞敏心中筑起的堤坝。
    此刻，张瑞敏心灵隐蔽的一隅正展开了激烈的格斗。面对76台“瑞雪”，他比在场的任何人都明白它在中国人心中的价值。在贫困曾浸滋过骨髓的中国人心中，冰箱，这个高档家用电器，尽管质量有些问题，总不该砸呵……人们压根无法接受面前的毁灭。但是，冰箱厂眼下最需要向小生产劣果和传统心态的挑战。在厂讨论会上，有人提出将这些次品削价处理给本厂工人，在众口一词的赞同声里，他曾犹豫过。坦诚地说，他本人也曾在被国人视为福音的“出口转内销”、
  “产品大削价”的柜台前、货摊旁驻足过，留恋过，抢购过。福耶祸耶？悲耶喜耶？……他力排众议，才勉强促成并摆开了眼前这肃穆的场面。此刻，面对千余双哀怜的目光，面对这群生产冰箱却又从未体味过冰箱妙处的人们，他的决心晃动了。
      “厂长！”又是一声呼唤。
    张瑞敏打了个愣，他担心时间会消蚀掉他的决心，便猛地一握右拳，狠劲朝下一压，从牙缝里挤出一个字：“砸！”
    一只只大锤缓缓举起，举起……
    哐！哐！哐！……如同蝉猴儿裂背时的揪心倒腹，千余双眼睛紧紧关闭，人们只觉得背在悸动，心在压痛……
    沉闷的锤声响着，响着。面前留下了小生产管理方式的残壳，唤起了20世纪80年代最为宝贵的大生产的质量意识。
    在重锤猛击所营造的氛围中，1985年6月，在中国，第一代四星级电冰箱琴岛——利勃海尔源源流出装配线……
    时间迅速地对张瑞敏作出了评说，厂房改建中工期提前一天，便可赢得15万元的产值……
    高起点的引进使危如累卵的青岛电冰箱总厂起死回生，西方工业文明的嫁接使这片沼泽地柳暗花明。但张瑞敏没有兀自陶醉，随着前来督战的西德专家登机西去，他的每根神经愈发绷紧了。他太了解他统辖的这支队伍了。锤砸“瑞雪”只能给人们敲敲质量意识的警钟，而不能从根本上改变这支队伍的素质。厂里的老师傅多是五行八作的工匠，新工人也没有经过大生产的锻锤。小生产与大生产有天壤之别。过去的王麻子剪刀、狗不理包子、德州扒鸡……这些小生产的代表作只是人的个性的张扬，而大生产则必须将个人的意志、行为纳入群体规范中。张瑞敏知道，眼下这支队伍，充其量不过是小生产的游击队，还远不是大生产的正规军，要改变它，必须用科学和知识去装备。
    于是，张瑞敏决定，不惜工本，让全厂职工分20期脱产培训；不脱产、分档次的培训随时举办。张瑞敏是学者型的厂长，他1968年高中毕业，曾是省重点中学的高材生。残酷的历史堵塞了他通往高等学府的大路，当了工人的他敢于同命运抗争，沉重的劳动负荷没有疲惫他强烈求知的饥饿灵魂，他坚韧地去破译令同辈人生畏的被硬壳包藏着的未知，终于自学成才，获得大专文凭。前几年，他常被一些厂家请去讲授企业管理课，且有管理文章见诸报端。可利勃海尔引进后，他愈来愈感到知识的匮乏。作为一厂之长，他无暇与职工同室共读，但每当请专家、教授来厂举办高层次的讲座时，他也决不坐失良机。见厂长谦恭就教，职工们也暗暗仿效……全新的知识，密集的信息，使人们抛开亚细亚的作坊，越过泰勒的“定额管理”，去追逐奈斯比特的《大趋势》，去接受托夫勒《未来的冲击》……人们通过一次次培训，该沉淀的沉淀了，该升华的升华了，如同鸟儿搏击长空的新羽在脱落旧毛时渐次丰满起来……
    与职工轮训同步，张瑞敏和他的副手们开始建立比引进利勃海尔还要艰辛十倍的管理机制。通过对国外先进管理经验的摄入、反刍、吸收，逐渐完善了一套洋洋两千项，洒洒千万言的管理条文，“琴岛”的290道工序无一能躲过这条文监测，171个部件也无一能逃避这条文的扫瞄，小生产的散慢随意，从中难觅一句遁词，当权者面对这条文再不敢信口雌黄，一切都在“例内”，任谁也不能“例外”……
    往昔厂里出现生产事故，厂部成了“急诊室”，有了这包罗万象的条文，车间班组都是
  “保健站”，每个工人也能为自己“号脉”，
  “服药”。生产的每道工序都有案可稽，投放市场的产品都有编号，一旦出现问题，反馈回来，查找生产档案，便一目了然，谁也休想瞒天过海……
    一青年工人在夜班下班时，忘记把第二天的生产用料备好，造成次日未能按时开工。分厂领导据条文前来追究责任。
    “你……”
      “工作没做好，俺认罚。”青工愧悔并立。
      “知道罚款数吗？”
      “俺对着条文细算过，当罚400来元。”青工心如刀绞。
      “应罚463元2角。能接受？”
      “说来是疼人，可连张瑞敏厂长都不例外，俺还吱吱啥。……”
    厂里无人不知，张瑞敏曾两次自罚并榜上点名。砸“瑞雪”时，他重罚了自己；在前不久进行的强化质量管理活动中，厂部出了丁点儿漏子，他又扣罚了自己全月的奖金。
      “厂长罚的那才冤枉呢。咳……”青工在一声长咳里接受着教训，也似乎找到了解脱。
    商品的市场如魔方，魔方变幻莫测，唯有产品的高质量，才能玩魔方于股掌之上；市场的商品如大海，大海波诡云谲，唯有高质量的产品，才能戏嬉于大海的波谷浪尖。由严格科学管理生发出的高质量，使琴岛——利勃海尔一问世，便备受市场青睐。上海，天津，北京……一股股
  “琴岛”热旋风般掀起……
    是它素雅俏丽的外观令人艳羡？也许是。设计者深谙国人心态，在发达国家，冰箱纯系生活器皿，常被置诸厨房或储藏室，而我们穷求虚荣的同胞，则将之作为炫耀品。“琴岛”玉洁的箱体上，嵌着一对袒腹露胸的中、德垂髫小儿，酷似笑口常开的小弥勒。青岛人昵称“利勃海尔”为“离不开的孩儿”，这孩儿一旦步入某个家庭，那叠床架屋的陋室里，便旋即溢满“佛面蜘蛛占喜事，入帘蝴蝶报家人”的欢愉……是物价飞涨使它成为抢手货？也许是。既然“存金存银不如存钢琴”已被屡屡验证，再不受骗上当，人们在接受历史教训时未免过于消极……
    当然，“琴岛热”还自有它的内核，那就是它卓尔不群的质量。它的开箱率一直为100％，从未发生过一次索赔事件；返修率在4‰（大大低于轻工部2％的规定标准）以下，达到世界先进水平；1987年6月，美、日、德、意、中等15家名牌冰箱参加世界卫生组织、国际银行投资举办的第二届电冰箱招标活动，它力挫世界群雄，一举中标……
      国人对“琴岛”刮目相看，洋人对“琴岛”惊叹不已。48个国家60余名记者专程来厂造访，回国后纷纷撰文盛赞“琴岛”……联邦德国驻华大使裴培义先生也专程来青，以窥庐山真面目。也许这位中国通深悉中国人那稔熟的花架子功夫，竟来了个猝不及防。市里摆好的接风宴他坚辞不受，驱车直奔厂里。当他不动声色、里里外外看了个遍后，不由得大动情怀，他在张瑞敏面前晃动着大拇指：
  “好！好！这是我在中国看到的第一个！……”还有一位外国专家来厂查看得更为仔细，临别前拍着张瑞敏的肩膀，不乏幽默地说：“OK，OK，管理华尔兹！”
      管理一座现代化的工厂毕竟不像跳舞那般轻松，倘若这位专家的赞誉不失为过，那么，青岛电
  冰箱厂的蔚蔚大观的千万言管理条文，便是这“华
  尔兹”舞曲的乐谱。按照这“乐谱”，厂领导班子配合默契，各司其职。张瑞敏跳的不是“光杆舞”，他
  和他的副手们统统都是“领舞人”……
      从管理“小儿科”到管理“华尔滋”，青岛电冰

  舞终曲断。换血，张瑞敏早就注意为这支队伍输血了。厂里已有200名具有大、中专学历的技术人员，他犹嫌不足。1988年夏，他抢在大学生分配前，广募良才。哈尔滨工业大学的高材生来了，上海交通大学的尖子来了，西安交大、山东大学的佼佼者也来了……厂里的职工食堂正在兴建，职工们包括厂里的大头小脑都在车间、办公室里就餐，而临时伙房的一侧却醒目地挂着一块牌子——大学生专用食堂。个别职工不以为然：大学生刚刚进厂，未建寸尺之功，受此厚爱，未免过分。张瑞敏喟叹不已：“当年拿破仑远征埃及时，曾下达了一道古怪的命令，‘让毛驴学者走在中间！’那是爱惜知识分子呵！连一赳赳武夫都知道尊重知识，何况我们……”接着，他不惜重金为大学生买下宿舍，宿舍里由公家配备彩电、冰箱、写字台、台灯……厂里的规章千条万款，初来的大学生难免有种束缚感。但不久他们便发现，具有兄长风度的张瑞敏，严格规章，是为了励精图治，而从不整人，没有令他们这代大学生切齿痛恨的“土皇帝”遗风，他让人感到，他仿佛是在邀请你干一件中国人早就该干而没有干的大事业……
    才随器使，大学生很快在生活中找到了自己的位置。1988年10月，厂里发生了一桩让人遗憾的事儿：与电冰箱厂协作的北京某单位，想卡厂里的脖子，不答应他们日益加码的条件，便动辄将提供的PC可编程序控制器搞乱或从车间摘走，造成设备停转。当前，我们国家这种“内耗”确乎屡见不鲜，但这次不灵了。当北京某单位的人将可编程序控制器摘走两天后，第三天又神气地来到厂里，满以为厂里会乖乖屈从，谁知进车间一看，机器照转不误。原来是大学生们日夜研磨，破译出那神秘的程序编号，重新装入新购的程序控制器。来者见状，蔫蔫而去……
    1988年，是青岛电冰箱总厂出尽风头的一年：它先是捧回了全国定点电冰箱大联展“最佳信誉杯”，摘取了全国电冰箱行业唯一的“质量管理奖”奖章，继而，在联合国儿童基金会电冰箱招标中一举夺魁，成为我国唯一的并连续两次在国际电冰箱招标中中标的厂家，使厂里70％的产品远销20个国家和地区……12月1日，是青岛电冰箱总厂尤为值得自豪的日子，国优评比揭晓，琴岛——利勃海尔登上“皇后”宝座，夺取了中国电冰箱史上的第一块金牌！
    龙年岁尾，厂里的职工在亢奋中企盼庆功会召开。金牌的霞光晃耀人眼，充实的钱袋使人飘飘欲仙。总会计师一揿计算机，产值比上年增长79．2％，利税比上年增长96％……二期工程即将竣工，1989年产值5亿胜券在握……这是4年前人们连想都不敢想的天文数字啊！这天，职工们接到全厂大会在青岛剧院召开的通知，欢乐的情绪一下蒸煮到沸点。青年女工薄施粉黛，刻意装扮，青年男工整容修面，衣冠齐楚。当人们怀着真挚的激情次第在剧院落座后，蓦然发现，华丽的剧院的主席台正中既没有扯挂庆功的会标，两侧也没有鼓吹的乐队。坐在台中央的张瑞敏，看上去心情似乎有些激动，那面如敷粉的脸颊上泛起玫瑰色的斑痕……人们隐隐约约觉得味儿有点不对。开会了，先是由一副厂长宣读一用户来信，接着由总工程师代表厂部宣布对19名干部工人的处分决定……
    会场鸦雀无声，亢奋的沸点骤然冷却为凝固的冰。事情的起根发苗是：一青岛用户买到一台“琴岛”，箱体内有一豆粒大的污点。用户到厂维修部要求退换，接待者推卸责任，以用户购时未当场开箱之故，提出诘难……张瑞敏接到用户投书后，立即决定，按照厂里的规章进行了处罚。豆粒大的污点牵连了从生产、销售到维修的19个人。那位态度不好者自然处分最重——厂级先进工作者的称号一笔勾销，“放逐”厂劳务市场，等候优化组合……
    在一片迷惘的目光中，一向沉稳的张瑞敏离开座位，慷慨陈词：“我知道，夺得金牌，厂里注入了一股欢乐的力量。但欢乐的力量既能鼓舞新的创造，也能使小生产沾沾自喜固步自封、坐井观天、夜郎自大的痼疾萌发。我们真的盖帽了吗？”他将右手当空一劈，“非也！夺得国优仅仅是‘全运会’金牌，我们的目标是向‘奥运会’金牌进军！”
    蝉蜕六次，方能登高一唱。此时，张瑞敏用铿锵语言的琴键，撩拨人们悸颤的心弦，产生了空谷回音。这声音伴随着推土机推倒旧窠的嗡嗡声，锤砸“瑞雪”的哐哐声，在大生产意识的回音壁上再度镌刻下擦不去抹不掉的音符……
    华灯初上，我们徜徉在这座海滨城市石砌的小道上，思绪万千。青岛，一部中国近代史的缩影，一座用民族屈辱的石块筑成的城市。九十几年前，这里仅有几幢茅舍，几户渔家，是洋人的坚船利炮使它沦为德租界，是德国人修的胶济路碾碎了它的袅袅渔歌。无情的毁灭伴随着神奇的创造。疯狂的掠夺留下了历史的馈赠。这东方威尼斯是在被动中痛苦地诞生。今天，那坚船利炮又化成软件电脑雄视世界，迫使我们这个民族进行主动地自我蜕变。如果说有着86年历史的青岛啤酒是在民族血泊中溢出的芬芳，那么，琴岛——利勃海尔则是在艰难蜕变里诞生的杰作。被动和主动仅一字之差，都那般痛不堪言，但痛苦的内涵却迥然不同。主动的蜕变才能防止被动的灭亡，愿千万个张瑞敏出现在这片大地上，愿管理“华尔兹”的舞曲去统领整个民族，去匡正那乱纷纷的脚步……
