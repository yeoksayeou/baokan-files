If the Yellow River is compared to a jade belt wrapped around the land of our motherland, then the Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area is a shining jewel embedded in this belt.

"All the riches of the Yellow River flow into Ningxia," the saying goes. The irrigation of the Yellow River in Ningxia has a history of over 2,000 years since the Qin and Han dynasties. However, the large-scale development of the irrigation area began only after the founding of New China. The new leap in agriculture in the irrigation area occurred after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party. Nearly two-thirds of the irrigation area was developed after liberation; the grain yield per unit area was only a few dozen kilograms before liberation, now it has increased to 400 kilograms (over 500 kilograms for rice), the total production was 1.585 billion kilograms in 1949, 7.7 billion kilograms in 1978, and reached 12.49 billion kilograms last year; the total agricultural output value was less than 100 million yuan in 1949, 4.23 billion yuan in 1978, and reached 13.4 billion yuan last year.

Over the past 40 years since liberation, the state has invested 1.42 billion yuan in water conservancy projects in Ningxia. Fifteen new main canals have been built and renovated, totaling 1,470 kilometers in length; 4,000 branch canals have been dug, totaling 9,900 kilometers in length; 790 kilometers of main drainage ditches have been dug and renovated; 4,300 kilometers of branch drainage ditches have been dug. In addition, 173 electric drainage stations, 8,400 drainage wells, seven large and medium-sized water lifting projects, and other facilities have been built, continuously expanding the irrigation area. Especially with the construction of the Qingtongxia Hydropower Hub, the water level was raised by 20 meters, ending the history of un-dammed water diversion in the Qingtongxia irrigation area, and forming a relatively complete drainage and irrigation system in the 194-kilometer-long and 30-40-kilometer-wide irrigation area from Qingtongxia to Shizuishan. Currently, the Yellow River irrigation area, with 37% of the total land area, produces about 75% of the total grain in the region.

Since the 1970s, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the development of the Ningxia irrigation area has taken new steps. Several medium-sized water lifting projects such as Tongxin, Nan Shan Taizi, Ganchengzi, and Bian Dan Gou, as well as hundreds of small water lifting irrigation pump stations, have been built in the peripheral areas of the Yellow River irrigation area where water cannot flow naturally, creating oases one after another. The Guhai Water Lifting Project, which started construction in 1978 and was completed in 1986, lifts water to a height of 342 meters through 11 pump stations, bringing Yellow River water to the arid and impoverished southern mountainous areas of Ningxia. It not only solves the drinking water problem for people and livestock along the way but also develops 442,000 acres of irrigated land, transforming the once barren and desolate southern mountainous areas of Ningxia into villages shaded by green trees and vast fields of high-yield crops. The formerly impoverished area, where "planting a hat, gathering a bundle, and harvesting a bag," now yields 200-300 kilograms or even 300-400 kilograms of grain per acre. Farmers also plant economic crops, afforest, and raise livestock. Those farmers who once moved into the new irrigation area with all their belongings on a cart have now not only escaped poverty but some have even become millionaires. In the past decade, the irrigated area of the Yellow River in Ningxia has increased by 1 million acres, mainly due to these water lifting projects.

The development potential of the Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area is enormous. This year, with the support of the state and the self-raised funds of the autonomous region, 570,000 acres of medium and low-yield fields have been transformed, and another 280,000 acres have been developed. Funds from other channels can also expand and improve the irrigation area by several hundred thousand acres. To solve the drinking water problem for people and livestock in Yanshi, Tongxin, and parts of Dingbian County in Shaanxi Province and Huan County in Gansu Province, and to comprehensively develop irrigation, the Yanshi-Huan-Ding Water Lifting Project started construction last year. After these projects are completed, the irrigation area can be expanded and improved by more than 1 million acres. The prospect of the Yellow River water conservancy benefiting the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia is very broad.

    广袤富饶的黄河灌区
    如果把黄河比作缠绕在祖国大地上的一条玉带，那么，宁夏黄河灌区就是镶嵌在这条玉带上的一颗明珠。
    “天下黄河富宁夏”，宁夏引黄灌溉自秦、汉以来已有两千多年的历史。但是，灌区大开发还是新中国成立以后的事。灌区农业新飞跃，则是党的十一届三中全会以后出现的。灌区面积的近2／3是解放以后开发的；灌区的粮食单产解放前只有几十公斤，现在提高到400公斤（水稻超过500公斤），总产1949年只有1.585亿公斤，1978年为7.7亿公斤，去年达到12.49亿公斤；农业总产值1949年不到1亿元，1978年为4.23亿元，去年达到13.4亿元。
    解放40年来，国家共投资14.2亿元用于宁夏的水利建设，先后新建和改造引水干渠15条，长1470公里；开挖支斗渠4000条，总长9900公里；开掘、整修排水干沟790公里；开挖支斗沟4300公里。另外还建成电力排水站173座，排灌机井8400眼，大中型扬水工程7处及其它设施，使灌区的面积不断扩大。特别是青铜峡水利电力枢纽工程的修建，抬高水位20米，结束了青铜峡灌区无坝引水的历史，使青铜峡至石嘴山194公里长、三四十公里宽的灌区，形成了比较完整的排灌系统。目前，引黄灌区以占全区37％的土地面积，生产占全区总产75％左右的粮食。
    从70年代开始，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，宁夏灌区开发又迈出新步子，先后修建了同心、南山台子、甘城子、扁担沟等中型扬水工程以及几百座小型扬水灌溉泵站，在引黄灌区外围不能自流灌溉的地区拼接了一块又一块的绿洲。1978年开工、1986年竣工的固海扬水工程，通过11级泵站，提水高度达342米，把黄河水送到干旱、贫困的宁夏南部山区，不但解决了沿途的人畜饮水问题，还发展灌溉面积44.2万亩，使昔日十年九旱、满目荒凉的宁夏南部山区出现了一个又一个绿树掩映的村庄和大片高产良田。过去“种一帽子、拢一抱子、打一包子”的穷地方，如今亩产粮食二三百公斤甚至三四百公斤。农民还种经济作物，植树造林，种草养畜。那些当年用一辆架子车拉着全部家当进入新灌区的农民，现在不但脱了贫，有的还成了万元户。近10年来，宁夏引黄灌溉面积增加了100万亩，主要就是这些扬水工程起了作用。
    宁夏引黄灌区的开发潜力很大。今年，由国家扶持、自治区自筹部分资金改造中低产田57万亩，另开发28万亩。从其它渠道筹集资金还可以扩大和配套改善灌溉面积几十万亩。为解决盐池、同心两县和陕西省定边县、甘肃省环县部分地区人畜饮水，综合发展灌溉，盐环定扬水工程于去年动工兴建。这些工程陆续完工后，又可扩大和改善灌溉面积100多万亩。黄河水利造福宁夏各族人民的前景十分广阔。
