Jiang Zemin Meets with Ito: China Can Achieve Set Economic Development Goals

Wang Zhen Emphasizes Development of Sino-Japanese Friendship and Cooperation on the Same Day

Today in the afternoon, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with Japanese guests and said that China can achieve its set economic development goals.

The meeting was held in Zhongnanhai. When Ito Seisaku, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union, led the delegation to visit China, Jiang Zemin warmly shook hands with the guests. Ito Seisaku said to Jiang Zemin, "It is my pleasure to meet you for the first time." Jiang Zemin humorously replied, "According to Chinese tradition, when meeting a politician like Mr. Ito Seisaku, one should say, 'I have heard your name for a long time, and it is as thunderous as it is famous.'"

At the guests' request, Jiang Zemin introduced China's current policies and economic development situation. Jiang Zemin said that China, with economic construction as the center, will not change its policies of adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up.

He said, "As for reform and opening up, we believe that with the development of science and technology and the economy, countries around the world need to have closer exchanges and cooperation. China's policy of reform and opening up will definitely be adhered to and will not retreat."

Jiang Zemin reiterated that China will, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, continue to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world, and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, develop economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with all countries in the world.

He said, "Currently, China is facing some difficulties in economic development, but 'we will overcome these difficulties through rectification and deepening reform and maintain a stable and appropriate economic growth rate to achieve our set economic development goals.'"

Ito Seisaku said that the Japanese people are willing to continue to develop friendly relations with China. The Japanese business community still gives high evaluations to China's investment conditions. The two countries should be friends for generations to come.

He said that the cross-party delegation he led this time came to China specifically to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

Today in the afternoon, Vice Premier Wu Xueqian also met with the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union. Both hosts and guests expressed their determination to work hard to continue developing Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation relations. Wu Xueqian also introduced to the guests the truth about the recent counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing and China's views on the international situation and China's foreign policy.

The chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association, Sun Pinghua, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shuxiang, and Japanese Ambassador to China Nakashima Toshiyuki participated in these two meetings.

Vice Chairman of the State, Honorary Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association Wang Zhen tonight hosted a banquet and met with the delegation led by Ito Seisaku, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

Wang Zhen called Ito Seisaku an "old friend of the Chinese people" and praised his efforts over the years in maintaining the principles of the Joint Statement of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China, and promoting the development of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation relations.

He said that China's policy of reform and opening up, independent and peaceful foreign policy, and the policy of developing friendly cooperation with Japan will not change.

Wang Zhen pointed out that continuously developing Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation relations is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

He believed that this visit by Ito Seisaku and his delegation would make new contributions to promoting the development of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation relations.
