As night falls and the lights come on, Panakong Vocational Education School in Bangkok becomes lively. Young people from all directions flock here after a day's work.

Principal Anpong led us on a tour while introducing the school. This vocational education school, with a history of 28 years, has never been as prosperous as it is now: the number of classrooms has increased from one building to four; the teaching staff has expanded from a few dozen to over 130; the number of specialties has increased from 10 to 21, especially with the addition of electronics, car repair, artificial flowers, and clothing; the number of students has increased from a few hundred to several thousand.

In the radio electronics classroom, tables are filled with televisions and tape recorders. Students are concentrating on assembling and repairing electrical appliances under the guidance of their teacher. A student told me that he works in a radio factory but his skills are not high. To improve his professional skills, he has been coming here to study after work for several months.

In the automotive assembly and repair specialty, every five or six students gather around a car, busy disassembling and assembling parts. A student said that after each theory class, they practice. A teacher standing by told us that most of Thailand's automotive manufacturing is joint ventures with Japan, mainly focusing on assembly. Although some funds, technology, and parts are imported from Japan, the technical workers are local. The development of the automotive assembly industry has increased the country's demand for technical workers in this field. These students can work in automotive assembly plants or repair shops after graduation.

Entering the clothing specialty classroom, rows of sewing machines have become the students' desks. They use various fabrics they bought to practice cutting and sewing. In recent years, this specialty has seen an increase in students due to the prosperity of the country's textile industry and the increase in clothing exports. A teacher said, "Our goal is to enable students to produce any style of clothing that customers want. Therefore, we teach students to learn, understand, and study the latest clothing styles in the world market. At the same time, we guide students to be creative while mastering the technology."

According to the principal, the longest time students spend studying at the school is one year, and the shortest is three to four months, which meets the government's requirement to quickly train technical personnel. Due to the rapid economic development in Thailand in recent years, there is a severe shortage of talent. The government has repeatedly asked the education sector to adopt more flexible measures to train more and faster professional technical talents. The government has also increased funding for vocational education and reduced student tuition fees. The lowest tuition fee at this school is 85 baht (approximately $3.40). The school also uses some of the products made by students to increase income, thereby reducing the government's burden.

An accompanying education department official told us that vocational education has become a trend. Currently, not only are government-run comprehensive vocational education schools increasing, but privately-run small single-subject vocational training centers have also emerged.

At the same time, the government is planning for the long term and pays great attention to the development of secondary vocational and technical schools. To solve the problem of a shortage of vocational education teachers, the government allows educational institutions to hire some retired government officials and technical experts from private enterprises to teach in schools. Some schools can also hire foreign experts. The number of such schools is also increasing and expanding.

    职业教育在泰国
    本报记者　刘爱成
    夜幕降临，华灯初上。曼谷市帕纳空职业教育学校开始热闹起来。结束了一天工作的青年从四面八方涌到这里。
    校长安蓬先生带着我们边参观边介绍。这个拥有28年历史的职业教育学校从来没有像现在这样兴旺：教学楼从过去的一幢增加到四幢；教师由几十名扩大到130多名；专业从10个增至21个，尤其是增加了电子、汽车装修、人造花和成衣等专业；学生从几百名增到几千名。
    无线电专业的教室里，桌上摆满电视机和收录机，学生们正在老师的辅导下，聚精会神地装配修理电器。一位学生告诉我，他在一家无线电厂工作，但技术不高。为了提高自己的业务技术，几个月来，他每天下班后就赶来这里学习。
    在汽车装配修理专业，每五六个同学围着一辆汽车，忙着拆装零件。一位学生说，他们每次理论课后都进行实践。站在一旁的老师告诉我们，泰国汽车制造业多数与日本合资，以装配为主。虽然部分资金、技术及零件是从日本引进，但技术工人是本国的。汽车装配业的发展使国家对这方面的技术工人需要量越来越大。这些学生毕业后，可到汽车装配厂或修理厂工作。
    走进成衣专业的教室，一排排缝纫机成了学生们的课桌。他们用自己买来的各种布料，练习裁剪、缝纫。近年来，这个专业随着国家纺织业的繁荣和成衣出口的增加，学生人数不断增加。一位老师说，“我们的目标是使学生达到顾客要什么款式，就能生产什么款式的水平。因此，我们让学生学习、了解和研究世界成衣市场上最新的服装款式。同时引导学生在熟练掌握技术的基础上具有创造性。”
    据校长介绍，该校学生在校学习时间最长一年，最短三至四个月，这符合政府关于尽快培养技术人员的要求。由于近年来泰国经济发展，人才严重短缺。政府一再要求教育部门采取更为灵活的办法，更多更快地培养专业技术人才。政府还增加了对职业教育的经费，减少了学生的学费。该校最低学费为85铢（约3.4美元）。学校还利用学生们生产的部分产品来增加收入，以减轻政府负担。
    陪同访问的教育部官员告诉我们，职业教育已成为一种趋势。目前，不仅官办综合性职业教育学校在增多，民办小型单科职业教育培训中心也应运而生。
    与此同时，政府还从长远打算，十分重视中等专业技术学校的发展。为了解决职业教育师资短缺问题，政府允许教育单位聘请部分退休的政府官员及私营企业的技术专家担任学校的教师，有的学校还可以聘请外国专家。目前这类学校也在增加和扩大。
