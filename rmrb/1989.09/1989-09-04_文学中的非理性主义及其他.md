The reform and opening-up tide has brought a surge of diverse cultural and intellectual currents, transforming stagnation into openness. The collision and exchange between Eastern and Western cultures have invigorated people's creative spirits, leading to a "cultural fever" and a flourishing trend in the cultural and intellectual spheres. However, on the other hand, especially in recent years, the activation of thought has also manifested as confusion and bewilderment. Various imported ideas have not been well digested and transformed, nor has a solid foundation been established, leading theoretical development to lack order, systematicness, and completeness.

The reform and opening-up tide has brought vitality to literary theory and creation. Theorists, leveraging various new ideas and methods, have extensively discussed topics such as literature and people, literature and society, the subjectivity, timeliness, and transcendence of literature, breaking away from the past's closed, rigid, and stagnant frameworks, presenting a multi-faceted academic development landscape. Writers have sincerely faced reality and life, using various artistic methods to present a large number of works beloved by the people, creating a vibrant scene of a hundred flowers blooming. Overall, the significant achievements of the literary world in the process of reform and opening-up are evident and cannot be underestimated. However, phenomena of multi-faceted distortions have also emerged.

The multi-faceted distortions in literature, relative to the entire cultural and intellectual sphere, have unique characteristics. They are more concentrated and deeply reflect irrational (anti-rational) trends. This trend is diverse and seemingly rich and novel, but its superficial multiplicity cannot hide the underlying shallowness and singularity, which is to abstract human nature, diluting or replacing human practice and sociality, and to emphasize human animalistic nature, excluding and negating human rationality.

The multi-faceted distortions of irrationalism in literary theory are manifested in three ways: first, in the blind worship of Western bourgeois literary theories; second, in the rejection and vilification of Marxist literary theories; and third, in the complete denial of national literary traditions.

In creation, the multi-faceted distortions of literary irrationalism are manifested in two ways: on the one hand, emphasizing self-centered creative consciousness, expressing the self, and self-expression, without considering social effects, following only personal feelings. Some works advocate that people and society, people and society, have only antagonistic relationships, venting the absurdity, melancholy, and loneliness of the self. Some writers appreciate and are fascinated by the confused and muddled human nature and the emotions of having no choice but to be bored. They pursue obscure, vague, and difficult-to-understand or extremely hard-to-comprehend "images." On the other hand, it is manifested in the vulgar and low-level "popular literature" that highlights instincts, caters to unhealthy or pathological social psychology with a "fist and pillow" style. These works attract readers with dangerous fights, bloodshed, sexual perversion, and multiple love affairs, aiming to satisfy physiological stimulation rather than normal entertainment needs. These two types of literary genres, although seemingly diverse, are actually monstrosities spawned by irrationalism.

Since the 19th century, Western trends such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche's voluntarism and superman philosophy, Freud's psychoanalysis, and Sartre's existentialism have all, to varying degrees, shown irrational tendencies. This powerful irrational trend, in response to the Western rationalist tradition that ignores emotions and instincts, has a certain historical rationality. Intuition, inspiration, and the subconscious also occupy a certain position in literary aesthetic activities and are worth serious study. However, in recent years, some people have blindly worshipped Western irrationalism in literary theory and creation, emphasizing the individual's opposition to the whole, the self's opposition to the object, and placing personal will, emotions, instincts, and the subconscious in a position of irreconcilable conflict with reason. Thus, they have moved from irrationalism to anti-rationalism. This irrational (anti-rational) trend, at a deeper level, contradicts the one-directional goal of literature serving the people and socialism, or in other words, literature under the influence of this irrational (anti-rational) trend cannot rationally serve the people and society. It instinctively and necessarily manifests as a resistance to the one-directional goal. We believe that irrationalism is the internal driving force and key to the multi-faceted distortions in literature in recent years. The self-centeredness, anarchism, national nihilism, loss and confusion, and rampant pornography manifested by irrationalism converge into a spiritual turbid stream, polluting people's spiritual world and distorting people's healthy personality. Such literature goes against the historical trend of reform and opening-up and deviates from the direction of literature serving the people and socialism.

The historical process of reform and opening-up is arduous, tortuous, and full of hope. Correcting the multi-faceted distortions in literature should not lead to the denial of reform or a return to the past, but rather should prompt us to learn from our mistakes and promote the healthy development of socialist literary undertakings. How can we, on the basis of openness, eliminate the interference of irrationalism and adhere to the one-directional goal of literature serving the people and socialism? We will briefly share our views on the following three points.

First, subject consciousness and rational consciousness. The atmosphere of reform and opening-up has enabled people to break free from spiritual shackles and revive subject consciousness. In recent years, the literary theory circle has emphasized subject consciousness, further accelerating the process of writers consciously establishing subject consciousness. The strengthening of subject consciousness has activated human creativity and is conducive to the formation of a multi-faceted literary landscape and trend. In a sense, without a strong subject consciousness, there would be no creative art itself.

Originally, subject consciousness is a higher level in the kingdom of human rational consciousness, but in the process of emphasizing and advocating subject consciousness in recent years, a large amount of anti-rational factors have been introduced. In some people's arguments, the "subject" is completely detached from objective reality, class groups, and external conflicts, and is only a solitary subjective self. As for the subjective self itself, it does not turn to the subject's cognition and rationality, nor does it lean towards experience and sensibility, but turns to instincts and desires, that is, turns to the irrational level. The previous advocacy of subject consciousness theory is erroneous not only in ignoring the mutual action and internal connection between the subject and the object but also in opposing and separating the subject's rationality and irrationality. This error in subject consciousness directly leads to the literary concept and creation emphasizing the irrational factors of life instincts, intuition, inspiration, unconsciousness, and unintentionality while excluding the guiding position of rationality. Thus, human natural animalistic nature replaces human subject practice, human primitive emotions negate human social intelligence, and the selfish, dark, and ugly aspects of human nature obliterate human noble morality and beautiful emotions. The creators of such works often advocate "subject awakening" or "self-realization," but in reality, they fall into the anti-rational vicious circle of subject alienation and personality distortion. The fact tells us that human rationality and irrationality are dialectically unified. Emphasizing subject consciousness must adhere to the restrictive and guiding position of rationality; otherwise, it is impossible to ensure the correct direction of socialist literature development.

Second, self-centeredness and a sense of mission. Self-centeredness and irrationalism are like twin brothers, mutually dependent and interdependent. Everything centered on the self is itself an irrational manifestation, and irrationality necessarily manifests as self-centeredness and is a product of self-centeredness. Some writers, including some talented writers who have created excellent works, have been immersed in extreme self-expressionism in the atmosphere of irrationalism, losing the broad vision of observing the world, becoming narrow and biased. At the same time, they are self-loving and self-pitying, either using creation for self-entertainment and playing with literature, or using literature to vent their resistance to society, or using literature to express their confused and repressed emotions. The literary style thus declines. Such works may not lack personal authenticity, but they certainly do not have the broad-mindedness to encompass the world and connect with the hearts of billions of people, nor can they have the power and heat to shock and ignite others' souls.

Indeed, literature, as an individualized spiritual product, cannot do without the writer's individual personality, unique feelings, and aesthetic choices. However, the writer's self is not an abstract existence detached from society; the "self" accumulates the essence of sociality. In the arduous, tortuous, and hopeful process of reform practice, those who lack a historical sense of mission and social responsibility, allowing irrationality to dominate the self, will never become great writers. Only by investing the self in the great tide of the times, upholding a sublime sense of mission and responsibility, can socialist literature flourish and prosper.

Third, nationality and humanity. The contemporary world is characterized by two major cultural trends: "global consciousness" and "root-seeking consciousness." On the one hand, modernization is a global trend, and modern culture is increasingly showing or tending towards internationalization; on the other hand, the independent development of each nation must seek its own cultural roots, thus constituting the necessary tension in contemporary cultural development between the two extremes. Literature, as a subsystem of the cultural system, is a concrete manifestation of culture and must reflect the characteristics of contemporary world culture.

The tension between the "global consciousness" and "root-seeking consciousness" of literature constitutes the complexity and richness of contemporary literary development. The global consciousness of literature emphasizes the world influence of literature, the various functions of literature beneficial to human progress and development, and the characteristics of humanity actively and consciously creating history. Humanity is composed of various nations around the world, and people can only live and think in the historical collective force in which they participate. Global consciousness should exclude the national nihilism spawned by irrationalism. The literary facts of China in recent years show that viewing the non-rational (anti-rational) literary trend of the West, which holds a pessimistic attitude towards human progress and excessively expresses despair and decadence, as "global consciousness," and using this "global consciousness" to deny the excellent traditions of national culture and literature, no matter how hard one tries to imitate, will be both ignored by compatriots and cold-shouldered by foreigners. The root-seeking consciousness of literature seeks the "roots" of national literature, emphasizing the national connotation, national style, and national characteristics of literature, emphasizing the inherent nationality of literature. The development of each nation influences and determines the development of humanity. The purpose of root-seeking is to seek better development for the nation in the contemporary world. Therefore, the nationality of literature is not the ignorant, selfish, rigid, and dark "inferior nationality" depicted in irrational works, nor should it be the irrationality of being outdated, closed-off, detached from reality, and diluting modern consciousness. The nationality and humanity of literature are intertwined, difficult to separate. The literary history of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, fully illustrates that great works that are rooted in their own nation, reflect tenacious national vitality, show the "national spirit" or national characteristics, and have distinct nationality, almost all harmonize with the healthy mentality of human development, can gain the recognition and appreciation of other nations, and produce a global influence.

Lu Xun once said in "On the Bias of Culture": "Externally, it does not lag behind the world's trends; internally, it does not lose its inherent bloodline. Taking the present and reviving the past, establishing a new school." In the global tide of reform and opening-up, in the process of realizing the four modernizations with Chinese characteristics, adhering to the one-directional goal of literature serving the people and socialism under a multi-faceted and healthy development will enable us to stand tall and establish a new school in the contemporary world literary hall.

    文学中的非理性主义及其他
    秦志希  饶德江
    改革开放的时代潮流，使文化思想界八面来风，由偏枯走向开阔。东、西方文化的撞击交流激活人们的创造精神，使文化思想界出现“文化热”和蓬勃发展的势头。但是，另一方面，特别是近几年来，思想的活跃又表现为思想的混乱与迷惘。各种“拿来”的观念未经很好地消化改造，也没有能找到一个赖以立足的基本点，进而使理论自身走向有序性、系统性、完善性。
    改革开放的时代潮流给文学理论和创作带来了生机。理论家们凭藉各种新思想新方法广泛探讨文学与人、文学与社会，文学的主体性、时代性、超越性等等课题，冲破了过去封闭、呆板、僵化的格局，呈现出百家争鸣的多元学术发展态势。作家们真诚地面对现实和人生，运用多种艺术方法，奉献出一大批广受人民喜爱的佳作，创作呈现出百花齐放的喜人局面。从总体上看，文学界在改革开放进程中取得的巨大成就是有目共睹，不容低估的。但也出现了多元畸变的现象。
    文学的多元畸变，相对于整个文化思想界自有其特殊性，它较为集中、较为深沉地体现为非理性（反理性）主义思潮。这股思潮花色繁杂，貌似丰富新奇，但其表面的多元却掩盖不住深层的单一肤浅，那就是以抽象人性淡化或取代人的实践、社会性，以人的动物性排斥否定人的理性。
    文学理论的非理性主义多元畸变，一是表现在迷信沉醉于西方资产阶级文艺理论。二是表现在排斥丑化马克思主义文艺理论。三是表现在彻底否定民族的文学传统。
    在创作方面，文学非理性的多元畸变一方面表现为强调自我为中心的创作意识，表现自我，自我表现，可以不顾及社会效果，一切跟着自我感觉走。一些作品宣扬人与人、人与社会只有对抗性，宣泄自我的荒谬、苦闷、孤独感，一些作家欣赏、迷恋浑浑噩噩、蒙昧混沌的人性和百无聊赖、别无选择的情绪，追求晦涩朦胧无法理解或极难意会的“意象”。二是表现为以突出本能、庸俗低级、迎合社会不健康或病态心理的拳头加枕头式的“俗文学”，这些作品以险情武打、血肉横飞、两性倒错、多角调情等吸引读者，是为了满足人的生理刺激而非正常的娱乐需求。这两类文学品种不少，貌似多元，其实都是非理性主义所滋生的怪胎。
    西方自19世纪以降，从叔本华、尼采的唯意志论、超人哲学，弗洛依德的精神分析学到萨特的存在主义等等，都程度不同地表现出非理性主义倾向。这股强大的非理性主义思潮，就对于忽视情感和本能的西方理性主义传统的反拨而言，有一定的历史合理性，而直觉、灵感、潜意识等在文学审美活动中也占有一定位置，值得认真研究。但近几年来，一些人在文学理论和创作中盲崇西方非理性主义，片面强调以个体对抗总体，以自我对抗客体，将个人意志、情感、本能、潜意识置于同理性誓不两立的地位，终由非理性主义走向反理性主义。而非理性（反理性）主义，正在一个深层次上违拗着文学为人民服务、为社会主义服务的一元导向，或者说，在这种非理性（反理性）主义影响下的文学，是不可能理性地服务于人民，服务于社会的，它本能地，必然地表现为对一元导向的对抗。我们认为，非理性主义正是近几年来文学多元畸变的内趋力及要害所在。非理性主义所表现的自我中心主义、无政府主义、民族虚无主义、失落迷茫、色情泛滥等，汇聚为一股精神浊流，污染着人们的心灵世界，扭曲着人们的健康人格。这样的文学，逆改革开放的历史大潮，违背了文学为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向。
    改革开放的历史进程艰难曲折而又充满希望。对文学多元畸变的纠偏不应导致否定改革、倒退复旧，而是促使我们在前进中吸取教训，健康发展社会主义的文学事业。怎样在开放的基础上排除非理性主义的干扰，坚持文学为人民服务、为社会主义服务的一元导向？我们仅就以下三点略陈己见。
    一，主体意识与理性意识。改革开放的大气候，使人们挣脱精神枷锁、复苏主体意识。而近几年来文学理论界高扬主体意识，更加速作家自觉确立主体意识的进程。主体意识的强化，激活了人的创造性，有利于文学多元格局和趋势的形成。从某种意义上可以说，没有强烈的主体意识，就没有创造性的艺术本身。
    本来，主体意识是人类理性意识王国中的一个较高级的层面，可是在近年来突出、高扬主体意识的过程中，却反而掺入大量反理性的因素。在一些人的论述中，“主体”完全疏离客观现实、阶级集团、外部冲突，而只是孤零零的自我主观性；再就其自我主观性本身而言，又不是转向主体的认知与理性，也不偏重转向经验与感性，而是转向本能、情欲，也即是转向非理性的层次。以前宣扬的主体意识理论，其谬误不仅在于忽视了主体与客体的相互作用和内在联系，还在于将主体的理性与非理性对立、割裂开来。这种主体意识的谬误直接导致文学观念与文学创作中片面强调生命本能、直觉灵感、无意识不自觉等非理性的因素而排斥理性的引导地位，于是乎以人的自然动物性取代人的主体实践性，以人的原始情感否定人的社会理智，以人性的自私、黑暗、丑恶抹煞人的高尚道德和美好情感。这类作品的制作者往往标榜“主体觉醒”或“自我实现”，实则陷入主体异化，人格扭曲的反理性怪圈。事实告诉我们，人的理性与非理性是辩证统一的，高扬主体意识必须坚持理性的制约、引导地位，否则就不可能保证社会主义文学发展的正确方向。
    二，自我中心主义与使命感。自我中心主义与非理性主义就像是一对孪生兄弟，二者相互依存，互为表里。一切以自我为中心，这本身就是一种非理性的表现，而非理性又必然表现以自我为中心，并且是自我为中心的产物。一些作家包括某些颇有才华并曾创作过优秀作品的作家，在非理性主义滋生、蔓延的氛围中沉迷于极端自我的表现主义，文学失却了审视大千世界的广阔眼界，变得十分狭隘偏窄。与此同时，他们自恋自怜，或以创作自娱而玩文学，或以文学宣泄自我对社会的反抗，或以文学表达自我迷茫压抑的情怀，文学的格调由此而降低。这样的作品或许不乏个人的真切感，但它决没有包容大千世界、牵系亿万人心的开阔胸襟，也不可能有震撼和燃烧别人灵魂的力和热。
    诚然，文学作为个性化的精神产品，离不开作家自我的个性气质、独到感受、审美选择等，但是，作家自我并不是脱离社会的抽象存在物，“自我”中积淀着社会性的本质。在艰难曲折充满希望的改革实践中，缺乏历史使命感和社会责任感，任凭非理性主宰自我的人是绝不会成为大作家的。只有将自我投入时代大潮之中，秉领崇高的使命感、责任感，社会主义文学才可能百花争艳、发达兴盛。
    三，民族性与人类性。当代世界并行、对流着两大文化思潮。一是“全球意识”，一是“寻根意识”。一方面现代化是世界思潮，现代文化日益显示或趋向于国际性；另一方面每一民族的独立发展又必须寻找自己民族文化的根基，这就构成了当代文化发展在对立两极中必要的张力。文学作为文化大系统中的支系统，是文化的具象显示，必然呈现出当代世界文化的特色。
    文学的“全球意识”与“寻根意识”之间的张力，构成了当代文学发展的错综复杂和多元丰富性。文学的全球意识，着重于文学的世界影响，着重于文学对人类进步、人类发展有益的种种功能，着重于自由自觉地创造历史的活动的人类的特性。人类由世界各种民族组成，人只能生活和思考在自己参与的群体创造的历史合力之中，全球意识理应排斥非理性主义所滋生的民族虚无主义。我国近几年的文学事实说明，将西方对人类进步持悲观态度、极度表现绝望颓唐情绪的非理性（反理性）文学思潮视为“全球意识”，且套用、摹仿这种“全球意识”来否定本民族文化、文学优秀传统的作品，无论怎样邯郸学步，都是既受同胞漠视，又遭外人冷遇。文学的寻根意识，寻求本民族文学的生长之“根”，着重于文学的民族内涵、民族风格，民族特征，着重于文学固有的民族性。各民族自身的发展影响和决定着人类的发展，寻根的目的是谋求本民族在当代世界中更好地发展，因此，文学的民族性并非反理性作品渲染的愚昧、自私、僵化、阴暗的民族“劣根性”，也不应是食古不化、闭关自守、远离现实、淡化现代意识的非理性。文学的民族性与人类性是异中有同、同中有异、颇难分割的。古今中外的文学史充分说明，植根于本民族、表现了顽强的民族生命力、现出“民族魂”或民族特征、具有鲜明的民族性的伟大作品，几乎都与人类发展的健康心态相吻合，能够博得其他民族的认同和欣赏，产生世界性的影响。
    鲁迅早就在《文化偏至论》中说：“外之既不后于世界之思潮，内之仍弗失固有之血脉，取今复古，别立新宗。”在改革开放的世界潮流中，在实现具有中国特色的四化进程中，坚持文学为人民服务、为社会主义服务一元导向下的多元健康发展，必将使我们在当代世界文学殿堂内昂首挺胸、别立新宗。
