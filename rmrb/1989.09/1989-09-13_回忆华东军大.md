“When the wind and rain rise over Mount Zhong, a hundred million heroes cross the Yangtze.” In the summer of 1949, Ningbo, Shanghai, and Hangzhou were liberated one after another, and the Chinese revolution was on the verge of victory. To meet the needs of national and military construction in the new era, the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, with their far-sighted vision, raised the issue of training cadres of the People's Liberation Army, who were in a state of frequent combat, and of gathering talents for the construction of the army. This was a strategic and wise decision. In June and July, the Third Field Army Forward Command was still in Shanghai, and Comrade Chen Yi discussed this new mission with us. At that time, our army needed to transition from a single military branch to a combined army of various branches, urgently requiring the strengthening of special forces and the replenishment of a large number of young, knowledgeable cadres. The cultural level in the Huadong region was relatively high, and a large number of enthusiastic young students flocked into the army, fully aligning with the needs and possibilities. The Huadong Military and Political University, which continued to operate in Suzhou after crossing the Yangtze with the PLA, and the Third Field Army Military and Political Cadres School, which continued to operate in Changshu, successively enrolled a large number of students, starting training and learning in an environment where the smoke of war had not yet dissipated. By the end of July, the Third Field Army Forward Command moved back to Nanjing. The preparation for the school entered the specific stage, including selecting the campus, adjusting teachers, and setting up the organization. On September 1, the Huadong Military Region and the Third Field Army Forward Command issued the "Decision on Establishing a Military and Political University," which, based on the aforementioned Huadong Military University, Third Field Army Cadres School, and part of the Eighth Army Group Direct Subordinate Unit, formed the Huadong Military and Political University. Comrade Chen Yi served as both the president and political commissar, Comrade Chen Shizhang as the vice president, I as the vice political commissar, Comrade Nie Fengzhi as the dean, and Comrades Yu Lijin and Zhang Chongwen as the director and deputy director of the Political Department. By mid-October, the Huadong Military University, including three brigades, eight regiments, and two cadre training teams, officially started classes. At the opening ceremony, Comrade Chen Yi delivered a famous long speech titled "Serving the People." This event has been nearly 40 years, and whenever I meet with faculty and students of the Huadong Military University, I always fondly recall Comrade Chen Yi's speech. That speech indeed touched the hearts of many listeners.

The Huadong Military University inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. The school focused on teaching, aiming to cultivate talents useful for the construction of our army. The youth team emphasized character education, with main courses including squad tactics, drill, shooting, military bearing, and the history of social development, conducting lively and vivid education on revolutionary worldviews, political situations, and basic military training. At that time, there were no formal classrooms. Each person had a small stool, and during class time, they would sit on the square for large lectures, or discuss in classes, or practice shooting and drill in platoons and companies. The students were eager to learn martial arts and were interested in guns, finding the commands of "attention," "at ease," and "about face" not tedious. They were all focused and serious. They came to the victorious army, where the military life was vibrant, and the cadres at all levels set an example. The newly born People's Republic of China, for which the older generation had paid a heavy price, was flourishing with various revolutionary and construction undertakings. All of this deeply inspired the young comrades, who were full of revolutionary fervor and high spirits. When discussing "Monkeys Transforming into Humans," they found the idea novel and often laughed, gradually establishing in their pure hearts the new concept that labor creates the world and humanity itself, changing the old idea of looking down on labor and laborers. They further recognized the greatness of the Communist Party of China, the honor of joining the People's Liberation Army, and the heavy responsibility they bore, igniting a conscious revolutionary enthusiasm. If it rained or winded, their activities would be held in the dormitories and corridors. The conditions were very primitive, but the students felt they were learning new things every day, and their minds entered a new realm, making them spiritually comfortable. They did not mind the primitiveness and hardships, considering it as learning from the old Red Army tradition. In fact, compared to the guerrilla environment of the old comrades and the war years, it was already much better. During their spare time, the campus was filled with sports and cultural activities, with singing and laughter everywhere, full of vitality. At that time, the "Huadong Military University" school newspaper also played a good role in complementing teaching and inspiring students' progress.

The Huadong Military University operated for only a year and a half. Due to changes in the military education system, it was reorganized on November 28, 1950, with part of it merging into the Military Academy and the main part being transformed into the Third Senior Infantry School. However, it was indeed a revolutionary melting pot, providing over 30,000 graduates to the army and local areas, meeting the needs of revolutionary development and army construction. Many comrades are now leaders or experts in various fields of party, government, and military. To record this history, organizing the writing of memoirs and publishing commemorative special issues, presenting the image of the Huadong Military University and the touching stories of young intellectuals starting from here to a brilliant today or tomorrow, is a very meaningful thing. It not only allows us who have lived in the military university to reminisce about those past journeys with interest, but also provides a way for later generations, especially young intellectuals, to understand history. Now, every year a batch of young intellectuals enter the army to engage in the great cause of national defense modernization. The revolutionization, youthization, intellectualization, and specialization of the PLA cadres will be completed by them, and will be elevated to an even higher level.

　　回忆华东军大
　　钟期光
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”1949年夏，宁、沪、杭先后解放，中国革命胜利在即。
    为了适应新时期国家建设和军队建设的需要，中共中央和毛泽东主席高瞻远瞩，提出了培训处于频繁作战状态下的解放军干部，和罗聚人才为部队建设输入新鲜血液的问题。这是一个具有战略眼光的英明决定。六七月间，三野前委机关还在上海，陈毅同志就向我们谈及这一新的使命。其时，我军要从单一军兵种逐步向诸军种、兵种合成军队转变，急需加强特种兵部队建设，迫切需要充实大批年轻的有知识的干部。而华东地区文化又比较发达，大批革命热情高涨的青年学生涌进部队，需要与可能完全统一了起来。随解放军渡江南下在苏州继续办学的华东军政大学，和在常熟继续办学的三野军政干部学校，就陆续招收了一大批学生，在战火硝烟尚未散尽的环境中展开训练与学习。7月底，三野前委机关迁回南京。办学的事进入了具体筹备阶段，包括选校址、调教员、设机构等等事宜。9月1日，华东军区、三野前委发出《关于开办军事政治大学的决定》，由上述的华东军大、三野干校和第八兵团直属队的一部为基础，组成华东军事政治大学。陈毅同志兼校长和政治委员，陈士榘同志为副校长，我为副政治委员，聂凤智同志为教育长，余立金、张崇文同志为政治部正、副主任。到10月中旬，包括三个总队、八个团和两个干部训练队的华东军大，就正式开学了。在开学典礼上，陈毅同志作了著名的题为《为人民服务》的长篇讲话。这事一晃快40年了，我后来每每遇见华东军大的教职学员，总是念念不忘地谈起陈毅同志这篇讲话。那次讲话，确实说进了众多听众的心坎里。
    华东军大继承和发扬了抗大的光荣传统。学校以教学为中心，以培养对我军建设有用的人才为着眼点。青年学生团队强调养成教育，以分队战术、队列与射击训练，军人姿态养成和社会发展史等为主课，进行生动活泼的革命人生观教育、政治形势教育和基础军事训练。那时也没有正规的课堂，每人一只小马扎，到上课时间，就在广场上大课，或以班为单位展开讨论，或以中队、区队为单位进行射击预习、队列训练。学生习武，投笔从戎，对枪很感兴趣，对立正、稍息和转法也不觉繁琐，都神情专注，严肃认真。他们来到胜利之师，部队生活生龙活虎，各级干部身为表率；而老一辈为之付出重大代价的中华人民共和国刚刚诞生，各项革命与建设事业正蓬勃发展。这一切，深深地感染着青年同志们，他们革命斗志旺盛，情绪特别高涨。讨论
  “猴子变人”时，都觉得这个观点很新鲜，不时传出笑声，在他们纯洁的心灵中，逐步树立起劳动创造世界、劳动创造人类本身的新观念，改变了轻视劳动和劳动人民的旧思想。进而认识到中国共产党伟大，加入人民解放军光荣，自己肩负的责任重大，焕发了自觉向上的革命热情。如遇刮风下雨，他们的活动就在宿舍内和走廊里进行。条件很简陋，但学员们觉得天天能学到新东西，他们的思维进入了一个新的领域，精神也就很舒畅。对于简陋、艰苦，他们认为这是学习老红军传统，也就不在话下。实际上，比老同志打游击的环境，比战争年代，已经好得多了。课余时间，校园内开展文体活动，到处是歌声和笑声，生意盎然。当时的《华东军大》校报，对配合教学、鼓舞学员进步也起了良好的作用。
    华东军大只办了一年多时间。由于军事教育体制的变化，到1950年11月28日即行改编，一部分并入军事学院，主要部分改建为第三高级步兵学校。但它不愧为革命的大熔炉，为部队和地方输送了3万余名毕业学员，适应了革命发展和部队建设的需要。很多同志现在成了党政军各条战线的领导干部或专家。为了记载这段历史，组织撰写回忆录，出版纪念专辑，把华东军大的风貌，以及年轻知识分子以此为起点走向光辉灿烂的今天或明天的感人事迹，重现于广大读者面前，是一件很有意义的事情。它不仅可以让我们这些在军大生活过的人，饶有兴味地回顾那些走过的征程；也为后来人，尤其是知识青年提供了一个了解历史的途径。现在每年都有一批知识青年进入部队，来从事国防现代化的宏伟事业，人民解放军干部的革命化、年轻化、知识化、专业化，将由他们来最后完成，并使之上升到更加高级的阶段。
