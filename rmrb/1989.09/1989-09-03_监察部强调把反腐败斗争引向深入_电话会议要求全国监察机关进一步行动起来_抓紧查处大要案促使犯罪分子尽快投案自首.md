    The Ministry of Supervision Emphasizes Deepening the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    Telephone Conference Requires National Supervision Agencies to Take Further Action

    Urgent Handling of Major Cases to Encourage Criminals to Surrender

    According to a report, the Ministry of Supervision held a telephone conference in Beijing on the evening of September 2, mobilizing national supervision agencies to take further action and deepen the anti-corruption struggle, with a focus on combating bribery and embezzlement.

    It is understood that since the Ministry of Supervision issued the "Notice," it has sparked a significant response nationwide. According to incomplete statistics, by August 31, more than 200 people had surrendered to the supervision agencies or voluntarily confessed their crimes, turning in illicit funds totaling over 2 million yuan, nearly 50,000 Hong Kong dollars, and a batch of illicit items including televisions, refrigerators, VCRs, motorcycles, and cars.

    Among those who surrendered or voluntarily confessed, there was one bureau-level official and 27 county or division-level officials. A significant proportion of these individuals were involved in embezzlement, bribery, and bribe-taking amounting to over 100,000 yuan.

    Minister of Supervision Wei Jianxing stated at the telephone conference that the "Notice" issued by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Supervision has clear targets and strong timeliness. To fully leverage the impact of the two "Notices," all levels of supervision agencies must take active and effective measures to encourage more individuals involved in embezzlement, bribery, bribe-taking, speculation, and other illegal and disciplinary actions to surrender or voluntarily confess within the specified timeframe, seeking leniency.

    He proposed that all levels of supervision agencies should concentrate their efforts on investigating and handling major cases. For those who surrender or voluntarily confess, actively return illicit gains, or have made significant contributions through reporting, the scope for leniency can be further expanded within the prescribed limits. For those who refuse to confess despite clear evidence, they should be severely punished. For those who interfere, shield, protect, retaliate, or falsely accuse and frame others, they should be strictly punished according to the law.

    Wei Jianxing required all levels of supervision agencies to handle the reception of voluntary confessions, surrenders, and reports seriously, ensuring that anyone who comes to the supervision agencies to confess or surrender at any time will be received and handled promptly.

    监察部强调把反腐败斗争引向深入
    电话会议要求全国监察机关进一步行动起来
    抓紧查处大要案促使犯罪分子尽快投案自首
    本报讯　国家监察部9月2日晚在北京召开电话会议，动员全国监察机关进一步行动起来，把以反贪污受贿为重点的反腐败斗争引向深入。
    据了解，自监察部发布《通告》以来，在全国引起了很大反响。据不完全统计，截至8月31日，到监察机关投案自首或主动交待问题的有200多人，已交出赃款共计人民币超过200万元、港币近5万元和彩电、电冰箱、录像机、摩托车、小轿车等一批赃物。
    据介绍，在投案自首或主动交待的人员中，有厅级干部1人，县处级干部27人，贪污、受贿行贿数额在万元以上的占相当大的比例。
    监察部部长尉健行在电话会议上说，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院与监察部发布的《通告》都具有明确的针对性和很强的时间性。为了充分发挥两个《通告》的威力，各级监察机关必须采取积极有效的措施，促使更多有贪污、受贿行贿、投机倒把等违法违纪行为的人在期限内投案自首或主动交待问题，争取宽大。
    他提出，各级监察机关要集中力量抓紧查处大案要案，对投案自首或主动交待，积极退赃或有检举立功表现的，在规定范围内，从宽的幅度还可以更大一些；对证据确凿仍拒不交待的要从重处理；对于说情袒护，徇私包庇，打击报复以及诬告陷害的，要依法从严惩处。
    尉健行要求各级监察机关认真做好主动交待问题或投案自首、以及举报的接待工作，保证任何时候到监察机关交待问题或投案自首都有人接待处理。
