Huang'an Nao is the main peak of Zhangshi Rock in Zanshang County, Hebei Province, with an elevation of 1,774 meters. Standing at the peak, one can observe the red sun rising from the Taihang cloud sea in the morning, and on moonlit nights with sparse stars, the bustling night scenes of the provincial capital Shijiazhuang and Xingtai's Niucheng City, 100 kilometers away, can be seen clearly. However, the most enchanting feature of Huang'an Nao is the Fog Cave.

The "Fog Cave" is one of the four major caves discovered in Zhangshi Rock to date. The other three caves have been explored by people since their discovery and are all dry, scenic, and unremarkable rock caves with traces of human activity. Only the Fog Cave on Huang'an Nao remains a mystery, with people still marveling at it from afar, none daring to venture a step closer.

The Fog Cave is not located midway up the mountain but in a lush, green valley. The cave entrance is about five to six meters in diameter, resembling a slanted mine shaft dug by miners. For some unknown reason, it continuously emits thick and thin fog throughout the year. In the early morning, the fog emanating from the cave is thick and white, like the sap flowing from a lacquer tree, like boiling milk overflowing from a pot, like the cotton piled on a cotton gin, like the smoke rising from a kitchen in the countryside. It surges out endlessly, rolling and rising like a smoke column. Once it ascends a few dozen meters above the mountain top, the fog seems to be blocked by something, preventing it from rising further. It then slowly disperses in all directions, resembling a magnificent mushroom cloud! After a while, the wind's blade cuts off the mushroom cloud's head, and the severed part quickly regrows another head. The cutting and regrowing continue endlessly, with no visible swordplay or bloodshed, only mushroom clouds without heads drifting away. At this moment, if you look around, you will be astonished to see that the large clusters of clouds floating and drifting at various heights and distances on the big and small peaks and treetops are all emanating from this Fog Cave on Huang'an Nao. Ah, the clouds and fog drifting in the vast sky are actually originating from the Fog Cave on Huang'an Nao.

　　神秘的雾洞
　　刘文娣
    黄庵垴是河北省赞皇县境内嶂石岩的主峰，海拔一千七百七十四米。站在峰顶，早晨可观看红日从太行云海中升起，月朗星稀的夜晚，百公里外的省会石家庄和邢台卧牛城的繁华夜景，历历在目。而黄庵垴最美妙的所在应属雾洞。
      “雾洞”为嶂石岩迄今发现的四大溶洞之一。其它三个洞自发现后就有人深入考察过，皆为无水无景无韵的岩洞，人间烟火早就有之。唯独黄庵垴上的雾洞，人们至今是望洞叹绝，无人敢越雷池一步。
    雾洞不在半山腰，而在一个草木葱茏的山凹，洞口约五六米方圆很像矿山工人开凿的一眼斜井。不知何故，它一年四季不断地涌出浓浓淡淡的雾来。清晨起，那洞口冒出的雾又浓又白，像漆树上开口处流淌的白汁，像沸锅里溢出的牛奶，像轧花车上堆起的棉花，像山野里升起的炊烟，涌流不断。它像烟柱似地翻卷、上升，等升腾过山顶几十米，雾头便停顿住，似乎前面被什么东西拦住了扶摇直上的路，于是便缓缓地向四周弥散开来，其状如一朵瑰丽的蘑菇云！少顷，风的利剑砍去了蘑菇云的头，被砍之处很快又生出一朵，不断砍，不断生，不见刀光剑影，不见血流喷溅，只有一朵朵断了头的蘑菇云悠悠飘去。这时，你环顾四周就会惊骇，在远远近近、高高低低的大小峰峦，林海树梢，那大团大团飘动游弋的云彩，全都是从这里飞出去的。呵，飘游在广阔天宇的云雾，竟源自这黄庵垴的雾洞。
