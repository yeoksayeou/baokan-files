The State Council has decided to adjust the regulations for officials traveling abroad. Starting from September 10, officials must spend at least six months abroad to be eligible to bring in one large and one small item tax-free.

	The Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on September 7 that the State Council Office has announced that in order to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, strengthen the management of imported goods, stop the practice of sending unnecessary personnel and delegations abroad, and actively promote the construction of a clean government, the State Council has decided to adjust the relevant regulations for officials traveling abroad.

	The State Council has decided that starting from September 10, the regulation allowing officials traveling abroad temporarily to exchange a small amount of foreign currency with RMB will be abolished. The regulation allowing officials traveling abroad to bring in one item each from the fourth and fifth categories listed in the "List of Quotas for Items Carried by Outbound Personnel" issued by the customs every three months will also be abolished. Instead, officials can bring in one item from each category tax-free for every six months (180 days) spent abroad, but this cannot exceed the maximum continuous tax-free period specified.

	The fourth category of items listed in the "List of Quotas for Tax-Free Items Carried by Outbound Personnel" issued by the customs refers to imported items such as televisions and refrigerators, as well as other daily necessities valued between RMB 500 and 1000, commonly known as large items. The fifth category refers to imported items such as ordinary electronic keyboards and typewriters, as well as other daily necessities valued between RMB 200 and 500, commonly known as small items. According to the new regulations, officials traveling abroad must spend at least six months (180 days) abroad to be eligible to bring in one item from each category tax-free. Long-term outbound personnel can enjoy tax-free benefits for up to four consecutive years, with the exception of aid workers and contract laborers who are not subject to the maximum continuous tax-free period. Temporary outbound personnel who spend less than six months (180 days) abroad can bring in one item from each category in the fourth and fifth categories of the "Quota List" tax-free for the first time they enter the country each calendar year.

	Relevant officials from the State Council pointed out that this adjustment to the regulations for officials traveling abroad is a specific measure to implement the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Several Matters of Concern to the People in the Near Future." Appropriately restricting the tax-free import of goods by officials traveling abroad will help national public servants prevent corruption, maintain integrity, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and struggle, and ensure that the reform, opening up, and modernization drive led by our Party proceeds deeply and healthily.

    国务院调整因公出国人员有关规定
    9月10日起满六个月方可免税带进一大一小件
    新华社北京9月7日电  记者从国务院办公厅获悉，为贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，加强对进口物品的管理，制止滥派人员、团组出国，积极推进廉政建设，国务院最近决定对因公出国人员的有关规定进行了调整。
    国务院决定，自9月10日起，取消因公临时出国人员用人民币兑换少量外汇的规定，取消因公出国人员每三个月可免税带进海关颁布的《出国人员带进物品限量表》内第四、五项物品各一件的规定，改为在外每满六个月（180天）可免税带进各一件，但不得超过规定的最高连续免税年限。
    海关颁布的《出国人员带进免税物品限量表》第四项所列物品是指电视机、电冰箱等进口物品和价值在人民币500元以上、1000元以下的其他生活用品，俗称大件。限量表第五项是指普通电子琴、打字机等进口物品和价值在200元以上、500元以下的其他生活用品，俗称小件。按调整后的新规定，因公出国人员在境外时间必须满六个月（180天），方可免税带进上述物品各一件。长期出国人员最多连续免税四年，其中经援人员和承包劳务人员不受最高连续免税年限的限制。临时出国人员在外不满六个月（180天）的，每公历年首次进境可以征税带进《限量表》第四、五项物品各一件。
    国务院有关部门负责人指出，这次调整因公出国人员的有关规定，是贯彻落实《党中央国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》的一项具体措施。适当限制因公出国人员免税带进进口物品，有助于国家公职人员防止腐败，廉洁奉公，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，使我们党所领导的改革开放与现代化建设事业深入健康地向前发展。
