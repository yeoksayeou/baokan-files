For the people to protect the environment and do practical things

	“We advocate that every province, city, county, department, and factory should consider doing a few practical things for the people in environmental protection every year, completing one thing at a time, and achieving real results.” This was proposed by Comrade Li Peng at the second national environmental protection conference held by the State Council five years ago. Since then, the State Council Environmental Protection Commission has taken the initiative to do practical things for the people in environmental protection as an important task. According to incomplete statistics from 1986 to 1988, a total of more than 4,940 practical things were done in various places. Among them, 1,238 dust control zones were established, covering an area of 5,243 square kilometers; 549 rivers were treated, with a total length of more than 3,200 kilometers, and nearly 60 polluted lakes were treated; 524 noise control zones were established, covering an area of about 1,000 square kilometers.

	The practical things done by governments at all levels every year for the people, which are visible and tangible, have played an active role in promoting urban and rural environmental protection.

　　为人民保护环境办实事
      “我们提倡一个省、一个市、一个县、一个部门、一个工厂，都应该考虑每年在环境保护上为群众办好几件事，办一件成一件，抓出实效来。”这是李鹏同志在5年前国务院召开的第二次全国环境保护会议上提出来的。此后，国务院环境保护委员会把为群众办环保实事作为一项重要工作来抓。据1986—1988年不完全统计，各地共办环保实事4940多件。其中，建成烟尘控制区1238个，面积5243平方公里；治理河流549条，长度3200多公里，治理受污染的湖泊近60个；建成噪声控制区524个，约1000多平方公里。
    各级政府每年为群众办的看得见、摸得着的实事，对推动城乡环境保护起了积极作用。
