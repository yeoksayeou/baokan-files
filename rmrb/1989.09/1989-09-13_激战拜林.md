Recently, the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese armed forces repelled the enemy's four-pronged attack in the Baylin region, killing or wounding over five hundred enemy soldiers.

In July and August of this year, just as the Paris International Conference aimed at seeking a peaceful resolution to the Cambodian issue was about to convene and was convening, the invading Vietnamese forces, in collaboration with the Phnom Penh puppet army, launched a large-scale offensive in the Baylin region of Cambodia's western province of Battambang. Their goal was to clear the way for the 10th Highway from Battambang City to Baylin, retake the strategic location of Srala Grola, which is north of Baylin City and had been liberated by the anti-Vietnamese forces. This would allow the Vietnamese forces on the west side of the 10th Highway to connect, relieve the pressure of the anti-Vietnamese forces on Battambang City, and coordinate with the diplomatic battle at the Paris Conference to increase Vietnam's and the Phnom Penh puppet regime's bargaining chips.

In the Battle of Baylin, the enemy deployed 7,000 Vietnamese soldiers and over 2,000 Phnom Penh puppet soldiers, utilizing dozens of tanks, several dozen cannons and multiple rocket launchers, as well as a large number of engineering vehicles and helicopters. They divided into four routes to advance towards Srala Grola.

However, the anti-Vietnamese armed forces stationed in the Baylin region are a brave and skilled fighting force. In 1985, when the invading Vietnamese forces concentrated their superior forces to encircle and suppress Phnom Voah, they maneuvered flexibly, heavily defeating the Vietnamese forces and successfully defending Phnom Voah. This time, they again employed effective tactics, dispatching small units to engage the enemy head-on, while the main force maneuvered to the enemy's flank and rear, frequently striking. They cut off the enemy's supply lines, combining guerrilla warfare with mobile warfare, killing and injuring the enemy, and consuming their forces.

The route composed of the Vietnamese 2nd Division, 330th Division, 302nd Division, the puppet 196th Division, 195th Brigade, and the Battambang garrison forces was tasked with the main objective of clearing the 10th Highway. As a result, over 80% of the route was cut off by the anti-Vietnamese forces, forcing the northern command of Oudong to detour via the 5th Highway for supplies. The northern forces composed of the Vietnamese 309th Division and the Phnom Penh garrison 879th Division also encountered serious obstacles during their advance, with low morale and increasing desertions. The commander of the puppet 879th Division admitted that one of his regiments, with over 400 soldiers, was reduced to only 40 men. He appealed to Phnom Penh for help but was met with criticism and ridicule: "Your troops are supposed to be very capable, how did it come to this?" The commander had no kind words: "Anyone who thinks they can do it should come to Baylin!"

On August 13th, the Vietnamese forces and the Phnom Penh puppet army launched a full-scale assault on Srala Grola, with infantry advancing under the cover of tanks and artillery. The anti-Vietnamese forces, however, dispersed into smaller units, making it difficult for the enemy's heavy weapons to be effective. After a week of intense fighting, the enemy was forced to abandon their plan to capture Srala Grola and retreat to their strongholds on August 21st. In the Battle of Baylin, the anti-Vietnamese forces killed or wounded over 500 Vietnamese soldiers, including injuring one enemy division commander, two enemy regiment commanders, and killing three enemy regiment commanders. Over 200 Vietnamese soldiers surrendered or defected. Over 1,000 Phnom Penh puppet soldiers were disbanded. The Battle of Baylin demonstrated that the Cambodian people have the determination and capability to continue the anti-Vietnamese resistance war to the end. No matter whether Vietnam and the Phnom Penh puppet regime play diplomatic tricks or launch military attacks, they will ultimately fail.

### 激战拜林

　　激战拜林
    前不久，柬埔寨抗越武装力量在拜林地区粉碎了敌人的四路围攻，毙伤敌军五百余人。
    今年七、八月间，正当谋求柬埔寨问题和平解决的巴黎国际会议即将召开和召开之际，侵柬越军纠合金边伪军在柬埔寨西部马德望省拜林地区向抗越力量发动了大规模进攻，妄图打通马德望市往西至拜林的十号公路，夺回位于拜林市以北被抗越力量解放的沙拉戈拉战略要地，以便使十号公路西侧越军据点连成一片，解除抗越力量对马德望市的威胁，并以此与巴黎会议的外交战相呼应，增加越南、柬伪讨价还价的筹码。
    在拜林战役中，敌人出动越军七千人，金边伪军二千余人，动用数十辆坦克，几十门大炮和多管火箭炮以及大量工程车辆、直升机，分四路向沙拉戈拉逼近。
    但是，驻拜林地区的抗越武装是一支英勇善战的部队。一九八五年，当侵柬越军集中优势兵力围剿兰山时，他们灵活机动，重创越军，胜利地保卫了兰山。这次，他们仍然采取行之有效的战术，派出小股部队正面阻击来犯之敌，主力则迂回到敌人侧翼和尾部，频频出击。他们切断敌人后勤补给线，把游击战与运动战相结合，杀伤敌人，消耗敌人。
    由越军二师、三三○师、三○二师，伪军一九六师、一九五旅以及马德望驻军组成的一路，担负着打通十号公路的主要任务。结果损失惨重，百分之八十以上的路段被抗越武装力量切断，给北线指挥部奥敦达的补给只得绕道五号公路运送。由越军三○九师和金边卫戍部队八七九师组成的北线部队，在推进过程中也严重受阻，士气低下，逃兵增加。伪军八七九师师长承认，他手下的一个团，四百多士兵逃得只剩下四十人。他向金边求救，受到指责和讥讽：“你的部队不是很能打仗吗，怎么搞成这样？”这位师长也没好话：“谁觉得自己能干就请到拜林来！”
    八月十三日，越军和金边伪军向沙拉戈拉发起总攻，步兵在坦克和大炮的掩护下推进。抗越武装则化整为零，使敌人的重武器难以发挥效力。经过一周激战之后，敌人于八月二十一日被迫放弃攻取沙拉戈拉的计划，退回据点。拜林之战，抗越武装打死打伤越军五百余人，其中打伤敌师长一人、团长二人，打死敌团长三人，二百多名越军投诚或被俘。金边伪军一千多人被瓦解。拜林之战表明，柬埔寨人民有决心有能力把抗越救国战争进行到底，不论越南和金边伪政权玩弄外交阴谋还是发动军事进攻，都将彻底失败。
