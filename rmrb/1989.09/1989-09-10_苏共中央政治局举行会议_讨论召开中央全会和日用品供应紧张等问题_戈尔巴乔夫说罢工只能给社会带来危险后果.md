Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 9th. According to a report by TASS today, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo held a meeting on the 8th, discussing issues related to convening a Central Committee Plenum. It was decided to submit the issue of convening the 28th Party Congress and the party's national policy under current conditions to this Plenum for discussion.

In preparation for convening this Plenum, the Central Committee had issued a draft national policy program in mid-August. The Politburo meeting pointed out that this draft program, which was submitted for nationwide discussion, has received the support of party organizations and the broad masses of workers. The Soviet people are particularly concerned about maintaining and strengthening the Soviet Federation. Only within this federation can issues such as the development of sovereignty for the various union republics and the expansion of the rights of autonomous republics, autonomous regions, and districts be resolved.

The meeting also discussed the issue of tensions in the supply of daily necessities. The meeting noted that the current shortage of daily necessities, especially items such as soap, detergent, toothpaste, student notebooks, and batteries, has naturally caused public dissatisfaction.

The Politburo meeting also criticized the party committees of the various union republics, territorial committees, regional committees, and the party committees of the various ministries and departments of the Soviet Union for not providing a principled evaluation of the work of party leaders responsible for the production and supply of daily necessities. They tolerated delays in the construction of production projects and allowed the reduction and curtailment of the production of scarce commodities. The meeting specifically criticized the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Chairman of the Chemical Forestry Complex Bureau, Gusev, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers' Social Development Bureau, Rakhin, and the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Yefimov, for not taking sufficient measures to ensure the supply of daily necessities and for relaxing supervision over the state of the consumer market.

The Politburo meeting announced that Yefimov would receive a severe party disciplinary action and that he could no longer continue in his position as Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission. The meeting instructed the Central Committee's Inspection Commission to discuss the responsibilities of Gusev, Rakhin, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 9th. Soviet leader Gorbachev said in a television broadcast on the 9th that attempting to solve problems through strikes would bring dangerous consequences to society, and that other methods should be used to address the issues that arise.

In his speech, the Soviet leader acknowledged that the reforms are proceeding with difficulty. He criticized the idea of trying to reverse course.

Gorbachev announced that the government is drafting a series of emergency measures to improve the economy and normalize the consumer market, which will be submitted to the upcoming session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet for consideration. The Supreme Soviet will make major decisions on further deepening economic and political reforms.

Regarding the national question, he said that it will soon be discussed at the Central Committee Plenum, and it is expected that a principled decision will be made on the transformation of the Soviet Federation.

He called on all progressive forces to unite and work together to carry out the reforms, while warning that those who attempt to use the current transitional difficulties to achieve ulterior motives and try to lower the party's prestige will not succeed. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union will firmly adhere to the reform line.

    苏共中央政治局举行会议
    讨论召开中央全会和日用品供应紧张等问题
　　戈尔巴乔夫说罢工只能给社会带来危险后果
    新华社莫斯科9月9日电　据塔斯社今天报道，苏共中央政治局8日举行会议，讨论了有关召开苏共中央全会的问题，并决定，将有关召开苏共28大和党在当前条件下的民族政策问题提交这次中央全会讨论。
    为筹备召开这次中央全会，苏共中央8月中旬曾发表了关于民族政策纲领草案。政治局会议指出，这一提交全民讨论的纲领草案，得到了党组织和广大劳动群众的支持。苏联人民特别关注的是，必须维护和巩固苏维埃联邦。只有在这一联邦中才能解决诸如各加盟共和国的主权发展、扩大自治共和国、自治州和区的权利等问题。
    这次会议还讨论了日用品供应紧张的问题。会议指出，国内出现的日用品供应紧张状况，特别是肥皂、洗衣粉、牙膏、学生用练习本、电池等商品短缺，引起了群众理所当然的不满。
    政治局会议还批评了各加盟共和国党中央、边疆区委、州委以及苏联各部委的党委，没有对负责日用品生产和供应工作的党的领导人的工作给予原则性的评价，容忍他们拖延建设生产项目的期限，同时容忍他们减少和压缩紧缺商品的生产。会议点名批评了苏联部长会议副主席、化学森林综合体局主席古谢夫，部长会议社会发展局第一副主席拉赫京和国家计委副主席叶菲莫夫，认为他们没有采取足够的措施以保障日用品的供应，放松了对国家消费市场状况的监督。
    政治局会议宣布给予叶菲莫夫以党内严厉处分，并认为他已不能再继续担任计委副主席的工作。会议责成苏共中央监察委员会讨论古谢夫、拉赫京等的责任问题。
    新华社莫斯科9月9日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫9日在电视台发表讲话说，试图用罢工来解决问题，将给社会带来危险的后果，应该用别的方法来解决产生的问题。
    苏联领导人在讲话中承认改革正在艰难地进行。他批评有人企图走回头路的想法。
    戈尔巴乔夫宣布，政府正在制订一系列非常措施来改善经济和使消费市场正常化，并将提交不久召开的苏联最高苏维埃会议审议，最高苏维埃会议将就进一步深化经济和政治改革通过重大决定。
    关于民族问题，他说很快就要在苏共中央全会讨论，预计将就变革苏维埃联邦通过原则性的决定。
    他呼吁各种进步力量团结起来，同心同德搞好改革，同时警告说，谁打算利用目前过渡时期的困难来达到不可告人的目的和企图降低党的声誉，这是行不通的。苏共将坚定地坚持改革路线。
