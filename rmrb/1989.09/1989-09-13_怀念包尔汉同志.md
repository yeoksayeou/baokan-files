Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 13th.

When Comrade Bao Erhan was seriously ill, I was out of town and did not know the news. After returning to Beijing, I learned of his passing and felt it was very sudden. I immediately arranged with Comrade Saifudin to visit his home to express condolences to his wife, Laxida, and his children. I also expressed my deep sorrow for Comrade Bao, this loyal communist warrior, great patriot, renowned social activist, and outstanding Uyghur scholar.

I have known Comrade Bao Erhan for a long time, but we worked directly together during the liberation of Xinjiang. Although that period was not long, it left a deep impression on me.

On December 7, 1949, I and then Political Commissar of the First Army Corps, Xu Licheng, flew to Di Hua (now Urumqi). Bao Erhan, who had already declared his uprising, and General Tao Zhiyue personally welcomed us at the airport. Bao Erhan wore a traditional Uyghur embroidered cap. As soon as we got off the plane, we embraced warmly according to Uyghur customs and cheered for the liberation of Xinjiang and its people. This was our first meeting.

In the following days, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government was officially established, with Bao Erhan as the chairman. At that time, I was the secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Branch. In Xinjiang, we worked together for three years until I left in 1952.

Bao Erhan made numerous contributions to the revolution throughout his life. The most brilliant page in his contributions should be his decision in September 1949, along with General Tao Zhiyue, to respond to the call of the Central Military Commission of the CPC, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, Zhu De, to resolutely break away from the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary government, declare an uprising, and achieve the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang.

On the way to Xinjiang, I repeatedly received reports about Bao Erhan and General Tao Zhiyue's meticulous planning for the peaceful uprising. After arriving in Xinjiang, we directly heard Bao Erhan's introduction to the details of the peaceful uprising. Generals Zhang Zhizhong and Tao Zhiyue, and Comrade Deng Ligong also introduced the relevant situation to me. This deepened my understanding of Bao Erhan's noble qualities of loving China, his ardent desire for the great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and his friendly feelings towards socialist Soviet Union. Especially, it deepened my understanding of his contributions to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang.

On New Year's Day 1949, Xinhua News Agency published a New Year's message written by Chairman Mao Zedong, solemnly declaring to the world that 1949 would see "the establishment of the People's Republic of China" and that "the Chinese people will achieve final victory in the great liberation war." Before and after the publication of the New Year's message, Bao Erhan, at the recommendation of General Zhang Zhizhong, the military and political governor of the Northwest, officially took up the position of chairman of the Kuomintang Xinjiang Provincial Government. Bao Erhan, who came from a poor family, had experienced cruel national oppression and class exploitation since his youth, and had developed a rebellious spirit against the old system. At this time, he was deeply influenced and inspired by the great situation of the Chinese people's liberation struggle led by the Communist Party of China. He decided to unite with people from all walks of life to strive for the liberation of Xinjiang's ethnic groups, becoming the last chairman of Xinjiang's dark age and the first chairman of the new era of light.

In response to the fallacies of imperialist elements and reactionary feudal leaders within Xinjiang who attempted to split Xinjiang from the great motherland, Bao Erhan sternly refuted them, repeatedly stating, "Xinjiang has been a part of China for more than two thousand years. Xinjiang is not the Xinjiang of a single ethnic group, but the Xinjiang of all ethnic groups." "Xinjiang will forever be a part of China, and the fate of Xinjiang is tied to the fate of the entire country." Bao Erhan also established contact with the leaders of the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay-based Three Districts Revolution led by Alimjan and Abasov, supporting the underground organizations of progressive ethnic youth, and developing patriotic democratic forces. He first sent people, and later personally, to discuss the matter of a peaceful uprising with General Tao Zhiyue, the deputy military and political governor and commander of the Xinjiang Garrison, making the preparations for the peaceful uprising proceed smoothly in military and political unity.

In 1949, the First Army Corps of the People's Liberation Army of China advanced westwards and quickly approached the gates of Xinjiang. The rapidly developing revolutionary situation caused a sharp split among the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Xinjiang, further solidifying Bao Erhan and General Tao Zhiyue's resolve to take the path of peaceful uprising.

Various anti-forces and American and British spies within Xinjiang, with the support of their respective masters, intensified their collusion and made desperate struggles. The commander of the Fifth Cavalry, Ma Chengxiang, and the commander of the 78th Division, Ye Cheng, attempted armed rebellion. Reactionary feudal tribal leaders, Usman and Janim Khan, under the instigation of the American consul in Di Hua, also plotted rebellion.

Just as the struggle between those supporting and opposing the uprising in the Xinjiang Provincial Government and the garrison was intense, Comrade Deng Ligong, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, secretly arrived in Di Hua from the Soviet Union via Ili. Bao Erhan and General Tao Zhiyue warmly received Comrade Deng Ligong. Originally, a residence had been specially prepared for Comrade Deng Ligong. Considering the need to do good work among the ethnic minorities for the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and to ensure secrecy and safety, when Deng Ligong arrived in Di Hua by plane from Ili, Bao Erhan personally welcomed him to his home. The two got along harmoniously, like family. Deng Ligong, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, expressed greetings and encouragement to Bao Erhan and General Tao Zhiyue, and handed over a telegram from Chairman Mao to General Zhang Zhizhong, propagating the Party Central Committee's propositions and policies. Bao and Tao also detailed the preparations for the peaceful uprising to Deng Ligong and requested him to report their sincerity and suggestions for the peaceful uprising to the Party Central Committee and seek timely guidance from the Party Central Committee on their uprising preparations. Through Deng Ligong, Bao Erhan sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on September 19. The telegram said: "Congratulations on the completion of the great cause of people's liberation by the PLA. We have decided to sever ties with the Kuomintang reactionary government and are now preparing all forces to eliminate reactionary forces, accept leadership, and celebrate the new birth in every corner, thus completing the liberation of the entire China led by your party." Bao Erhan's firm resolve for a peaceful uprising and his joy at the imminent victory of the great cause of people's liberation were evident in every word. Four days later, Bao Erhan received a telegram from Chairman Mao, personally delivered by Deng Ligong: "Received the telegram. We are deeply grateful for your good intentions. The change in the situation in Xinjiang and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups depend on your efforts. We hope you will continue to unite with patriotic democratic elements and cooperate with the PLA's entry into Xinjiang to strive for the liberation of the entire Xinjiang." Following the instructions of Chairman Mao, with the help of Deng Ligong, Bao Erhan and General Tao Zhiyue worked closely together, bravely and wisely, to thwart the rebellion and treason plots of Ma Chengxiang, Ye Cheng, Usman, and Janim Khan. The conditions for a peaceful uprising were ripe. On September 25, General Tao Zhiyue led 100,000 troops to declare an uprising. On September 26, Bao Erhan led the provincial government personnel to declare an uprising. Xinjiang and its people of all ethnic groups were reborn.

After the military and political forces in Xinjiang declared a peaceful uprising, the situation remained tense as the PLA had not yet entered Xinjiang: a few stubborn elements in the uprising army were still causing trouble, and separatist elements and spy elements were spreading a large number of rumors and inciting trouble. On one hand, Bao Erhan ordered the drafting and mass printing of "A Letter to the Uprising Soldiers," praising their uprising actions, and organized various ethnic groups and sectors to comfort the uprising soldiers, cooperating with General Tao Zhiyue to stabilize military morale; on the other hand, he sent a temporary government delegation led by Mayor of Di Hua, Qu Wu, and Hasanmujiang to the headquarters of the First Field Army in Jiuquan to welcome the PLA to quickly enter Xinjiang. The temporary government led by Bao Erhan also specially organized the "Welcome PLA into Xinjiang Committee" and set up reception stations, prepared accommodations, and gifts. With the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the assistance of the military and political uprising personnel in Xinjiang, on October 20, the advance detachment of the PLA's outbound troops, the Armored Division, entered Urumqi as scheduled. The PLA's various armies also successively entered various places in South and North Xinjiang, successfully completing the task of marching into Xinjiang and hoisting the five-star red flag over the Tian Shan, Altay, and Pamir Plateau.

At the airport welcoming me and Comrade Xu Licheng to Urumqi, Bao Erhan praised the speed of the PLA's advance. I told him that you and General Tao Zhiyue decided to protect the people and maintain the integrity of the motherland, ensuring that the country's territory remains intact, and your contributions will be recorded in history.

Bao Erhan is not only a great patriot but also a loyal communist warrior. Soon after the establishment of the CPC Xinjiang Branch, Bao Erhan came to me and solemnly expressed his urgent desire to join the Communist Party of China, and detailed his process of understanding the Communist Party. Bao Erhan, in his youth, witnessed and personally experienced cruel national oppression and class exploitation, developing a strong desire to change the extremely backward and closed situation in Xinjiang. At that time, he believed that the extreme corruption and darkness in Xinjiang were merely due to the lack of developed industry, transportation, education, etc. However, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, due to official duties, he often traveled through the Soviet Union to Germany and other European countries, witnessing the stark contrast between the two systems. At that time, the capitalist world economic crisis was sweeping across the European continent. Bao Erhan personally witnessed the destructive results of this crisis in the most developed capitalist country, Germany, seeing unemployed people thrown onto the streets, including not only workers in miserable conditions but also unemployed engineers and other intellectuals wearing signs and begging. A widow, unable to live due to long-term unemployment, first threw her three children into the river and then jumped in herself. Bao Erhan also told me that he had seen police carrying the bodies of unemployed workers who had committed suicide by gas with their entire families. While the capitalist tycoons were living in a world of indulgence and debauchery. Bao Erhan said, the phenomenon he saw in extremely backward Xinjiang and in the "most advanced" capitalist country was essentially the same, making him realize that these phenomena must have deeper causes. In the Soviet Union, however, Bao Erhan saw a different reality: no unemployment, no huge gap between the rich and the poor, no hunger, no economic crisis; instead, there was hard work and year-by-year progress in economic construction and material life. Although people's material lives were not yet very rich, their spiritual outlook was optimistic, and the relationships between people were sincere, equal, friendly, and mutually supportive. At this point, Bao Erhan was very moved: "Two systems, two scenes, this living fact told me that the socialist system led by the Communist Party is good!" Hearing Bao Erhan's words, I thought of his early contact with Marxism, his acquaintance with CPC member Yu Xiusong, and his poem "Highest Respect to Mao Zedong" written in 1939 while suffering in Sheng Shicai's prison. All this made me further understand that Bao Erhan's choice of the bright path of peaceful uprising at the crossroads of darkness and light in Xinjiang was not only based on patriotism but also on his respect and love for the Communist Party, his yearning and longing for socialism, which might be the dominant thought in his bright choice. The Party organization reviewed Bao Erhan's political history and real performance, and after my and Xu Licheng's introduction and reporting to the Central Committee, on December 31, 1949, Bao Erhan was exceptionally admitted as a formal member of the CPC without a probationary period and served as a member of the CPC Central Xinjiang Branch. In 1952, he was appointed as a standing committee member. After joining the Party, Bao Erhan strictly required himself according to the standards of a communist warrior, seriously studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, actively participated in democratic reforms under the leadership of the Party, supported the colonization and defense of the border, and worked even harder to build a civilized, united, prosperous, and flourishing new Xinjiang.

Bao Erhan is also a learned and talented Uyghur scholar. He was diligent in self-study and in 1929, he enrolled in the Department of Politics and Economics at the University of Berlin, achieving excellent results. He was well-versed, mastering Uyghur, Chinese, Russian, German, Turkish, and other languages and scripts, thus playing a role in political and diplomatic activities. He was particularly knowledgeable about the history and geography of Xinjiang and Western Asia. During the time we worked together in Xinjiang, we often had long conversations, and I often sought his advice on some issues. He said that Xinjiang, covering about one-sixth of the country's area, was historically known as the Western Regions. The name "Xinjiang" only began to appear in the Qing Dynasty. However, ancient Western Regions or Xinjiang were much larger than today's Xinjiang. It was only in modern times, due to the invasion of imperialism, especially the Russian Empire, that China's northwestern border lost a large amount of territory. There is a large amount of historical records and artifacts proving that as early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, Xinjiang had frequent economic and cultural exchanges with the interior, making the interior and the Western Regions increasingly inseparable, deepening the friendship between the people of the two regions, thus preparing the necessary conditions for the later political unification of Xinjiang with the interior. Bao Erhan also talked to me about Zhang Qian's two missions to the Western Regions during the Western Han Dynasty. He said that Zhang Qian established the position of the Envoy Protector, leading soldiers to farm in the area of Luntai (now Luntai) and Quli (now Kuerle), until formally appointing Zheng Ji as the Protector-General of the Western Regions, "The orders of the Han Dynasty were issued to the Western Regions, beginning with Zhang Qian and completed by Zheng Ji." At this point, the Western Regions were officially included in the territory of the Han Dynasty. Bao Erhan was very excited and said, "This fully proves that Xinjiang is an inseparable sacred territory of China. Any country or person's attempt to split Xinjiang from the motherland's embrace is shameful and futile!" Bao Erhan's becoming a respected great patriot is inseparable from his solid and rich historical knowledge. Once, Bao Erhan talked to me about the so-called "Khanate of Kashgaria" established by Alim Khan, a military leader of Kokand in the late 1860s. Bao Erhan said that Alim Khan's separatist activities were strongly supported by Russian and British imperialism. The Russian and British empires used threats of force and bribery to make Alim Khan their puppet. Their shameful goal was to attempt to split Xinjiang from our country. Therefore, it is necessary to fully affirm Zuo Zongtang's march into Xinjiang, the elimination of Alim Khan's regime, and the recovery of Xinjiang's personal historical role. I completely agree with Bao Erhan's view. I added that historical figures should be analyzed with Marxist concrete analysis. Zuo Zongtang, as a representative of the landlord class, suppressed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising and the anti-Qing uprising of various ethnic groups in the northwest, and did other bad things, but his merit of recovering Xinjiang should be recorded in history. Later, Bao Erhan wrote a historical essay "On the Regime of Alim Khan" based on his views. In 1952, when Bao Erhan met Chairman Mao, he mentioned his essay, and Chairman Mao read the article with great interest and gave full affirmation. Bao Erhan strove to study the history of Xinjiang and Western Asia with historical materialism, achieving unique results. Bao Erhan was multi-talented. His compiled "Uyghur-Chinese-Russian Dictionary" and his play "The Roar of the Flame Mountain" were well-received. At the age of 90, Bao Erhan wrote nearly 300,000 words of memoirs "Fifty Years in Xinjiang," for which I was delighted to write a preface.

Looking back on the past, it is vivid. Although my old Uyghur friend Bao Erhan has passed away, his outstanding contributions to the Party, the motherland, the people, and national unity are immortal.

　　怀念包尔汉同志
　　王震
    包尔汉同志病重期间，我在外地，不知道这一消息。返回北京后，得知他与世长逝，感到很突然，便急忙约赛福鼎同志一道，来到他的家里，向他的夫人拉希达同志及其子女表示慰问，向包老这位忠诚的共产主义战士、伟大的爱国主义者、著名的社会活动家和卓有才能的维吾尔族学者表示深切悼念之情。
    我与包尔汉同志相交甚久，但直接共事，是在解放新疆那段时日。那段时间虽然不长，却给我留下了很深的印象。
    1949年12月7日，我和当时任一兵团政治委员的徐立清同志一道乘飞机来到迪化（今乌鲁木齐）。已经通电起义的包尔汉先生和陶峙岳将军亲自到机场迎接我们。包尔汉先生戴着维吾尔族绣花小帽，一下飞机，我们便按照维吾尔族礼节热烈拥抱，共为新疆和新疆各族人民的解放而欢呼。这是我们第一次见面。
    此后几天，新疆省人民政府正式成立，包尔汉同志任主席，那时我任中共新疆分局书记。在新疆，我们相与共事达三年时间，直到1952年我离开那里。
    包尔汉同志一生为革命作出了众多的贡献，这些贡献中最有光彩的一页，应该说是他在1949年9月，与陶峙岳将军一起，响应中共中央军事委员会毛泽东主席和中国人民解放军朱德总司令的伟大号召，毅然决然脱离国民党反动残余政府，通电起义，实现了新疆的和平解放。
    在进军新疆的路上，我就不断听到关于包尔汉先生与陶峙岳将军一道精心筹划和平起义的情况报告。我们到新疆后，又直接听到包尔汉主席对和平起义内情的介绍，张治中、陶峙岳二位将军和邓力群同志也给我介绍了有关情况，从而使我对包尔汉主席热爱中华的高尚品质、促进祖国各民族大团结的热切愿望和对社会主义苏联的友好感情留下了深刻的印象，特别是对他和平解放新疆作出的贡献加深了了解。
    1949年元旦，新华社发表的由毛泽东主席撰写的新年献词向中外郑重宣告，1949年将要“宣告中华人民共和国的成立”，
  “中国人民将要在伟大的解放战争中获得最后胜利”。在新年献词发表的前后，包尔汉同志在西北军政长官张治中将军的力荐下，正式出任国民党新疆省政府主席。包尔汉同志出身贫苦，经受了残酷的民族压迫和阶级剥削，青年时代就产生了对旧制度的反抗思想。此时，他深受中国共产党领导的中国人民解放斗争大好形势的影响和鼓舞，决心团结各方人士一齐努力，争取实现新疆民族解放，让自己成为新疆黑暗时代的最后一任省主席，同时也成为光明的新时代的第一个省主席。
    针对新疆境内帝国主义分子和反动封建头目妄图把新疆从伟大祖国怀抱中分裂出去的谬论，包尔汉同志正色批驳，多次讲道：“新疆两千多年来就是中国的一个组成部分。新疆不是一个民族的新疆，而是各民族的新疆”。“新疆永远是中国的一块领土，新疆的命运，是和全中国的命运连在一起的”。包尔汉同志又取得与阿合买提江和阿巴索夫等领导的以伊（犁）、塔（城）、阿（勒泰）为中心的三区革命的联系，支持进步的各民族青年的地下组织，发展爱国民主力量。他先是派人，后来亲自与西北军政副长官、新疆警备总司令陶峙岳将军密谈一道和平起义的事宜，使和平起义的准备工作军政联袂、相互配合、齐头并进地开展起来。
    1949年，我中国人民解放军第一野战军第一兵团胜利西进，很快就威逼玉门关下，直叩新疆大门。飞速发展的革命形势使国民党的新疆军政人员发生剧烈分化，也更加坚定了包尔汉先生和陶峙岳将军走和平起义道路的决心。
    新疆内部的各种反对势力及美英特务，在各自主子的支持下加紧勾结，作困兽斗。敌骑五军军长马呈祥和敌七十八师师长叶成等企图武装暴乱，反动封建部落头目乌斯满、贾尼木汗在美国驻迪化领事馆的唆使下也阴谋叛乱。
    正当新疆省府和驻军拥护起义和反起义斗争激烈的时候，中共中央联络员邓力群同志奉党中央之命，从苏联经新疆伊犁秘密来到迪化。包尔汉同志和陶峙岳将军热情接待了邓力群同志。原来，为邓力群同志特意准备了住处，包尔汉同志考虑到要在少数民族人士中做好新疆和平解放的工作，又利于保密和安全，当邓力群同志从伊犁乘飞机到迪化时，包尔汉同志亲自到机场把他接到了自己的家里。两人相处融洽，亲如家人。邓力群同志代表党中央、毛主席向包尔汉同志、陶峙岳将军表示慰问和鼓励，并面交了毛主席发来的张治中将军给他俩的电报，宣传了党中央的主张和政策。包、陶二人也向邓力群同志详细介绍了关于和平起义的准备工作，请他向党中央转报他们对新疆和平起义的诚意和建议，请求党中央对他们起义准备工作进行及时指导。通过邓力群同志，包尔汉同志于9月19日给毛主席发了一份电报。电文说：“解放军胜利完成人民解放伟大事业，谨致无上之欣祝”，“经决意与国民党反动政府脱离关系，兹已准备一切力量消灭反动势力，接受领导，俾每一角落共庆新生，以完成贵党所领导的整个中国之解放”。包尔汉同志和平起义的坚强决心，对即将取得的人民解放伟大事业最终胜利欣喜愉悦之情洋溢字里行间。四天之后，包尔汉同志便收到了由邓力群同志亲自转交给他的毛主席回电：“申皓电悉，极感盛意。新疆局面的转变及各族人民的团结，有赖于贵主席鼎力促成。尚望联络各方爱国民主分子，配合人民解放军入疆之行动，为解放全新疆而奋斗。”按照毛主席指示精神，在邓力群同志的帮助下，包尔汉同志与陶峙岳将军紧密团结，不顾安危，有勇有智，挫败了马呈祥、叶成、乌斯满、贾尼木汗等人的暴乱、叛乱阴谋。和平起义的各方条件已经成熟。9月25日，陶峙岳将军率十万官兵通电起义。9月26日，包尔汉同志率省政府人员通电起义。新疆和新疆各族人民获得了新生。
    新疆军政通电和平起义后，由于我人民解放军尚未入疆，局势依然十分严峻：起义部队中的少数顽固分子还在捣乱，民族分裂主义分子和特务分子大量炮制谣言，煽动滋事。包尔汉同志一方面责成起草和大量印发《告起义将士书》，赞扬他们的起义行为，并组织各族各界慰劳起义将士，配合陶峙岳将军稳定军心；另一方面，派出由迪化市市长屈武先生和哈生木江率领的临时政府代表团到达一野总部所在地酒泉，欢迎人民解放军火速进疆。包尔汉同志领导的临时政府还专门组织了“欢迎人民解放军进疆委员会”，并设了接待站，准备了营房和慰问品。在新疆各族人民的大力支持下，在新疆军政起义人员的协助下，10月20日，我出塞部队先遣支队战车团按预定时间进驻乌鲁木齐。我各路大军也先后进驻南、北疆各地，圆满完成了进军新疆的任务，把五星红旗插上了天山、阿勒泰山和帕米尔高原。
    在欢迎我和徐立清同志到达乌鲁木齐的机场上，包尔汉同志称赞我人民解放军进军神速。我对他说，你和陶峙岳将军决计保境安民，为维护祖国统一尽心尽责，确保祖国金瓯无缺的贡献将名垂青史。
    包尔汉同志不仅是一名伟大的爱国主义者，而且是一名忠诚的共产主义战士。中共新疆分局成立后不久的一天，包尔汉同志找到我，向我郑重地表达了请求加入中国共产党的迫切愿望，并详细谈了他对共产党的认识过程。包尔汉同志在青少年时，亲眼目睹和亲身经历了残酷的民族压迫和阶级剥削，产生了改变新疆极端落后的闭塞状况的强烈愿望。那时他认为，新疆之所以存在极端腐朽黑暗的现象，仅仅是由于缺乏发达的工业、交通、教育等。但是，在20年代末30年代初，他由于公务关系，经常途经苏联到德国等欧洲国家时，目睹了两种制度两重天的实情，使他的思想认识产生了一个飞跃。当时，资本主义世界经济危机正席卷欧洲大陆，包尔汉同志在当时资本主义最发达的德国亲眼目睹了这场危机的破坏性结果，亲眼看到因失业而被抛上街头的人们，其中不但有处境悲惨的工人，而且有脖子上挂着牌子伸手向人们乞讨的失业工程师一类的知识阶层人士。一位寡妇因长期失业，无法生活，只好先将3个亲生儿女扔进河里，然后自己也投河自尽。包尔汉同志还对我说，他还亲眼看见过警察在抬运用煤气自杀的失业工人全家的尸体。而资本家的大亨们却过着花天酒地、纸醉金迷的生活。包尔汉同志说，在极端落后的新疆和在“最先进”的资本主义国家所见到的这种在本质上是相同的现象，使他认识到，这些现象之所以产生，肯定还有更深刻的原因。而在苏联，包尔汉同志看到的却是另一种现实：没有失业，没有贫富的巨大差别，没有饥饿，没有经济危机；有的却是勤奋的劳动和一年比一年进步的经济建设和物质生活，人们的物质生活虽然暂时还不是十分富有，但他们的精神面貌却是乐观向上的，人与人之间的关系是真诚、平等、友爱、互助的。说到这里，包尔汉同志十分动情：“两种制度，两种景象，这活生生的事实告诉我，共产党领导下的社会主义制度好！”听了包尔汉同志的这番话，使我想起了他早年就接触马克思主义，结识中共党员俞秀松的经历，想起了1939年他在盛世才的监狱里备受磨难，但对中国共产党及其领袖的爱戴和崇敬却日益增加而挥笔写下的维吾尔诗文《崇高的敬意献给毛泽东》。这些都使我进一步明白了，包尔汉同志之所以在新疆黑暗与光明的抉择关头，毅然选择和平起义的光明大道，不仅仅有爱国主义思想作基础，他对共产党的崇敬和热爱，对社会主义的憧憬和向往，更可能是他作出光明抉择的主导思想。党组织又审查了包尔汉同志的政治历史和现实表现，经我和徐立清同志的介绍，并报请中央批准，1949年12月31日，包尔汉同志未经候补期而被破格接纳为中共正式党员，并担任了中共中央新疆分局委员，1952年8月又任分局常务委员。入党后，包尔汉同志严格按照共产主义战士标准要求自己，认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，在党的领导下，积极参加民主改革，拥护屯垦戍边，更加辛劳地为建设文明、团结、富裕昌盛的新新疆而竭尽全力，努力工作。
    包尔汉同志还是一位学识渊博、卓有才能的维吾尔族学者。他勤奋自学，1929年考入柏林大学政经系，并取得优秀的学习成绩。他学识渊博，先后掌握了维、汉、俄、德、土耳其等多种语言文字，从而在政务和外交活动中发挥了作用。他对新疆和西亚的历史、地理等尤为精通。在新疆共事的那段时日里，我们经常促膝长谈，有些问题，我也经常向他求教。他说，新疆这块约占全国面积1／6的地方，在历史上通称西域，“新疆”这一名称仅从清代才开始出现的。不过，古代的西域或新疆，比现在的新疆要大得多。只是到了近代，由于帝国主义，特别是沙俄帝国的侵略，我国西北边疆才失去了大片的领土。有大量史料、实物证明，早在春秋、战国的时候，新疆与内地便有频繁的经济文化上的交往，这就使内地和西域日益成为不可分割的整体，使两地各族人民之间的友谊日益深厚，这就为后来新疆与内地在政治上的统一准备了必要的条件。包尔汉同志还向我谈到西汉时张骞两次出使西域的情况。他说，张骞设立使者校尉，率领士卒在轮台（今轮台）、渠犁（今库尔勒一带）一带屯田，直到正式任命郑吉为西域都护，“汉之号令班西域矣，始自张骞而成于郑吉”，至此，西域这块地方，正式列入汉朝版图。说到这里，包尔汉同志十分激动，他断然地说：“这充分说明，新疆是中国不可分割的神圣领土，任何国家，任何人妄图把新疆从祖国怀抱里分裂出去的阴谋都是可耻的、徒劳的！”包尔汉同志之所以成为一个受人尊敬的伟大的爱国主义者，是与他的坚实、丰富的历史知识分不开的。还有一次，包尔汉同志同我谈起了19世纪60年代后期，中亚浩罕的军事头目阿古柏建立的所谓“哲德沙尔汗国”政权。包尔汉同志说，阿古柏的这一分裂活动，是得俄、英帝国主义大力支持的。俄、英帝国采用武力威胁和拉拢收买等手段，要阿古柏充当他们的走狗，他们的可耻目的，是妄图把新疆从我国分裂出去。因此，应当充分肯定左宗棠进军新疆，消灭阿古柏政权，收复新疆的个人历史作用。我完全赞成包尔汉同志的这一观点。我补充说，对历史人物，要作马克思主义的具体分析。左宗棠作为地主阶级的代表人物，镇压过太平天国农民起义和西北各族人民的反清起义，还干过其它不好的事情，但他收复新疆的这一功绩应当载入史册。后来，包尔汉同志根据自己的观点写了《论阿古柏政权》的历史论文。1952年，包尔汉同志见到毛主席时提到了自己这篇论文，毛主席很感兴趣地读了这篇文章，并作了充分的肯定。包尔汉同志力争用历史唯物主义的观点研究新疆和西亚的历史，取得了独特的成就。包尔汉同志多才多艺，他所编纂的《维汉俄词典》，创作的剧本《火焰山的怒吼》，都受到大家的欢迎。在90高龄之时，包尔汉同志还撰写了近30万字的回忆录《新疆五十年》，我欣然为之作了序。
    回首往事，历历在目。虽然我的维吾尔族老朋友包尔汉同志已经作古，但是，包尔汉同志为党、为祖国、为人民、为民族团结作出的杰出贡献是不朽的。（新华社北京9月13日电）
