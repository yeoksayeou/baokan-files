China's cadre personnel system has undergone ten years of reform and exploration, yielding many good experiences and breakthrough progress in several areas.

The Communist Party of China's Central Organization Department introduced that the cadre personnel system reform over the past ten years has primarily focused on the following aspects:

Under the guidance of the policy of "revolutionizing, rejuvenating, intellectualizing, and professionalizing" cadres, after several major adjustments, the situation of having too many, too old, and too low-educated leaders at various levels has fundamentally changed, and the normalization of new and old cadre replacement has been basically achieved. From 1982 to the end of 1988, nearly 640,000 young and middle-aged cadres took up leading positions at the county and bureau levels and above, while 3.4 million elderly cadres retired. Currently, more than 90% of the leadership members of party committees and governments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels and their working departments have been promoted since 1982. The average age of the leadership teams at the three levels has decreased by more than 6 years; cadres with a college education or above account for more than 60% of the total number of leadership team members at the three levels. Currently, most leadership teams have formed a ladder-like age structure.

After the Party Central Committee issued the "Decision on Establishing a Retirement System for Senior Cadres" in 1982, a large number of senior cadres retired, setting a practical example by abolishing the lifelong tenure system for leadership positions. After the "Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Adjustment of Cadres Who Are Not Competent in Their Current Positions" was approved by the Central Committee and issued in 1986, a number of incompetent cadres were adjusted through democratic appraisal and organizational assessment, opening new channels for abolishing the lifelong tenure system for leadership positions. In addition, many regions and departments have strictly implemented relevant regulations on terms of office, and some places have even tried the term system.

To meet the needs of various reforms, with the approval of the Central Committee, starting from 1984, according to the principle of "managing fewer, managing better, and managing flexibly," the authority to manage cadres was delegated. The 13th Party Congress decided to further reform the cadre management system, changing the situation of using a single method to manage various different personnel.

To improve the transparency and democratization of cadre work, the public's right to choose and supervise cadres was expanded, breaking the long-standing secrecy and manual methods in cadre work. First, the election system was improved; second, the selection of cadres must go through democratic recommendations or public opinion surveys; third, clear regulations were made for the democratic procedures of selecting cadres; fourth, democratic appraisals or democratic evaluations were conducted annually for county and bureau-level and department-level leading cadres.

The methods of appointing cadres were reformed, breaking the single pattern of the appointment system, and implementing selection, assessment, and contract-based appointments. The recruitment of cadres was carried out on a large scale, openly recruiting and selecting the best through public examinations. Enterprises generally implemented the contract system, township cadres generally implemented the selection and appointment system, and professional and technical personnel implemented the professional and technical position contract system.

The responsibility system was promoted to party and government agencies and enterprises, and the position responsibility system and term target responsibility system were generally implemented. This has played an active role in improving the style of work, improving work efficiency, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres.

In conjunction with organizational reforms and adjustments to leadership teams, cadres were systematically exchanged to different positions under the leadership and organization, and the system of avoiding leadership positions is being promoted. Now, the number of county party secretaries and county magistrates who are from the same county has been greatly reduced; there are not many provincial, municipal, and county-level leading cadres who have worked in the same position for more than 10 years.

The training system was reformed, the training system was improved, and the quality of the cadre team was improved. By the end of 1988, there were 2,800 party schools at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, 2,500 various cadre schools, more than 500 colleges and universities, and more than 1,000 secondary vocational schools undertaking the task of cadre training. By the end of last year, a total of more than 8 million cadres had been trained nationwide.

The reserve cadre system was further improved. After several years of efforts, a relatively large, comprehensive, and high-quality reserve cadre team has been formed in party and government agencies at the county level and above nationwide, providing a large number of talents to various levels of party and government leadership teams.

The legislative work of the cadre system has also made gratifying progress. According to the overall design and comprehensive coordination requirements, the "Provisional Regulations on State Civil Servants" and several specific regulations that match it have been or are being formulated.

The relevant departments of the Central Organization Department pointed out that in the future, we should seriously summarize the experience, further improve and perfect the reform measures that have been introduced, and actively and steadily promote new reform methods in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that the overall reform of the cadre personnel system can gradually be improved.

    十年探索取得许多好经验
    干部制度改革获突破性进展
　　中组部表示将进一步健全完善已出台的改革措施
    本报北京9月17日讯　记者宋世琦报道：我国的干部人事制度经过十年改革探索取得许多好的经验，在不少方面有了突破性进展。
    据中共中央组织部介绍，干部人事制度改革十年来主要从以下几个方面展开：
    在干部“革命化、年轻化、知识化和专业化”方针指导下，经过几次较大的调整，各级领导班子人数偏多、年龄偏大、文化偏低的状况，有了根本改变，基本上实现了新老交替的正常化。自1982年到1988年底，全国有近64万名中青年干部走上县处级以上领导岗位，同时有340万名老干部离休退休。目前，省、地、县各级党委、政府及其工作部门的领导成员，90％以上是1982年以来提拔上来的，省、地、县三级领导班子的平均年龄，分别下降6岁以上；具有大专以上文化程度的干部，已分别占三级领导班子成员总数的60％以上，目前大多数领导班子基本形成梯次年龄结构。
    1982年党中央作出了《关于建立老干部退休制度的决定》以后，大批老干部离休退休，以实际行动带头废除领导职务终身制。1986年经中央批准下发《关于调整不胜任现职的领导干部职务几个问题的通知》后，通过民主评议和组织考核，调整了一批不胜任现职的干部，为废除领导职务终身制，开通了新的渠道。此外，许多地区和部门，严格执行有关任期任届的规定，不少地方还试行了任期制。
    为适应各项改革需要，经中央批准，从1984年开始，按照“管少、管好、管活”的原则，下放了干部管理权限。党的十三大又决定进一步改革干部管理体制，改变了用管理党政干部的单一办法管理各类不同人员的状况。
    提高干部工作的透明度即民主化程度，扩大了群众在干部工作上的选择权和监督权，打破了干部工作中沿习已久的神秘化和手工业方式。一是健全选举制度；二是选拔干部要经过民主推荐或民意测验；三是明确规定干部选拔的民主程序；四是对县处和司局级领导干部每年进行一次民主评议或民主考评。
    改革干部任用办法，打破单一的委任制模式，实行了选任、考任、聘任等多种形式。录用干部在相当大的范围内实行面向社会、公开考试、择优录用。企业中比较普遍地实行聘任制，乡镇干部普遍实行选聘制，专业技术人员实行了专业技术职务聘任制。
    把责任制推广到党政机关和企事业单位，普遍实行岗位责任制和任期目标责任制。这对改进机关作风，提高工作效率，调动干部的积极性，起了积极作用。
    结合机构改革和调整领导班子，有领导、有组织地实行了党政领导干部的易地交流制度，正在推行领导干部任职回避制度。现在，由本县人在本县当县委书记、县长的数量大大减少了；省地县领导干部在本岗位上连续工作10年以上的已不多了。
    改革培训制度，健全培训体系，提高干部队伍的素质。到1988年底，全国有省、地、县三级党校2800所，各类干部学校2500所，还有500多所高等院校，1000多所中专学校承担干部培训任务。到去年底止，全国累计培训干部800多万人次。
    进一步健全了后备干部制度。经过几年的努力，在全国县以上党政机关，已经形成了一支数量比较可观、门类比较齐全、素质比较好的后备干部队伍，向各级党政领导班子输送了大量人才。
    干部制度的立法工作也已经取得可喜的进展。按照总体设计、综合配套的要求，《国家公务员暂行条例》等法规及与之相配套的若干单项具体规定已经或正在制定。
    中组部有关部门指出，今后要认真总结经验，进一步健全和完善已经出台的改革措施，有计划、有步骤地、积极稳妥地推出新的改革办法，使干部人事制度的全面配套改革逐渐完善起来。
