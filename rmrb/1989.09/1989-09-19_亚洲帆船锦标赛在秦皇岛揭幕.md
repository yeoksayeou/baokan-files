The biennial Asian Yacht Championship is being held in China for the first time. The previous championship did not include women's events, but this year two women's events have been added: the 470-class yacht and the DII-class windsurfing board. Along with the men's 470-class yacht, men's DII-class windsurfing board, and the Antipole-class yacht, Laser-class yacht, and OP-class yacht, there are a total of 7 events in the competition.

The competition committee said that the level of yacht sports in Asia is currently behind the rest of the world. Within Asia, the Chinese and South Korean teams have relatively strong capabilities, and the Pakistani team also has significant strength in individual events.

The competition will conclude on September 24.

　　亚洲帆船锦标赛在秦皇岛揭幕
    新华社秦皇岛9月17日电　（记者蒋满堂）来自10个国家和地区的98名帆船运动员，今天在秦皇岛市海滨迎风破浪，竞相争锋，拉开了第五届亚洲帆船锦标赛的战幕。
    两年一届的亚洲帆船锦标赛在中国举行尚属首次。上届比赛没有女子项目，这届比赛则新增了两个女子项目——470级帆船和DII级帆板，加上男子470级帆船、男子DII级帆板和安特普莱级帆船、莱塞级帆船、OP级帆船，共有7个项目的竞赛。
    竞赛委员会负责人介绍说，亚洲帆船运动水平目前在世界上还处于落后状态。就亚洲来说，中国队、南朝鲜队的实力较强，巴基斯坦队在单项上也有不可忽视的实力。
    比赛将于本月24日结束。
