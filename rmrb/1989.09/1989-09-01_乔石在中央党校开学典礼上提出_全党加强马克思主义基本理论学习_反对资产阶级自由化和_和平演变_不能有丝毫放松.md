People's Daily, Beijing, September 1st - Reporter Yin Pinduan reports: Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and President of the Central Party School, said today at the opening ceremony of the 1989 autumn semester at the Central Party School that strengthening the study of Marxist basic theory throughout the Party is a fundamental measure to strengthen Party leadership and building. The task of seriously studying Marxist basic theory should be more prominently placed before the entire Party, especially Party cadres at the high and middle levels.

Qiao Shi said that the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred a few months ago put our Party and country through a severe test. Although the storm has passed, we should seriously summarize our experiences and "calmly consider the past and the future." The documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches are our guiding ideology for summarizing experiences, which are extremely important not only now but also in the future.

Qiao Shi urged the comrades coming to the Central Party School to study to further clarify the situation, to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, and to firmly walk the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said that international hostile forces have never given up their attempts to overthrow the socialist system. They always place their hopes for "peaceful evolution" on our third or fourth generation and have never stopped infiltrating socialist countries with their ideology. In a recent period, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's attitude of indulgence and retreat towards the bourgeois liberalization trend, it caused the bourgeois liberalization trend to spread. Our struggle against the reactionary strategy of international imperialism attempting to make us undergo peaceful evolution, and our struggle against the bourgeois liberalization trend will be long-term, and we must never relax at any time.

Qiao Shi said that Comrade Deng Xiaoping particularly emphasizes learning and mastering Marxist theory, especially reminding the whole Party to prevent some comrades, especially the new middle-aged and young comrades, from losing their way in increasingly complex struggles. In this struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion, our Party, as a whole, has withstood the test, and the majority of Party members and cadres have performed well. However, there is indeed a part of Party members and cadres whose stance is not firm, whose banner is not clear, and who have even lost their way and committed serious errors or crimes. Apart from those who are originally political opportunists or reactionaries, many of them are due to poor political and theoretical qualities, and their thoughts have been confused by the bourgeois liberalization trend, causing them to fail the test at the critical moment. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the study of Marxist basic theory throughout the Party.

Qiao Shi hoped that everyone would seriously read some works by Marx and Lenin, some works by Chairman Mao, and also seriously read some works by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They should also try to read some works by other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries. They should use the basic theories they have learned to study new problems that arise in the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics and explore new solutions.

The opening ceremony was presided over by Vice President of the Central Party School Xing Benxi, and Vice President Xue Ju also spoke.

    乔石在中央党校开学典礼上提出
    全党加强马克思主义基本理论学习
    反对资产阶级自由化和“和平演变”不能有丝毫放松
    本报北京9月1日讯　记者尹品端报道：中共中央政治局常委、中央党校校长乔石今天在中央党校1989年秋季开学典礼上说，在全党加强马克思主义基本理论学习，是加强党的领导和建设的一条根本措施，要把认真学习马克思主义基本理论的任务更加突出地提到全党特别是党的高、中级干部面前。
    乔石说，几个月前发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，使我们党和国家经受了一次严峻的考验。现在风波虽然过去了，但我们应该认真总结经验，“冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来”。十三届四中全会文件和小平同志的讲话，是我们总结经验的指导思想，不但在现在，而且在今后都有着极其重要的意义。
    乔石要求来中央党校学习的同志，进一步认清形势，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，坚定不移地走有中国特色的社会主义道路。他说，国际敌对势力，从来没有放弃过颠覆社会主义制度的企图，他们始终把“和平演变”的希望放在我们的第三代或第四代人身上，也从来没有停止过对社会主义国家进行思想渗透。一个时期以来，由于赵紫阳同志对资产阶级自由化思潮采取纵容、退让的态度，造成了资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥。我们对国际帝国主义妄图使我们和平演变的反动战略的斗争，对资产阶级自由化思潮的斗争将是长期的，任何时候都不能有丝毫的放松。
    乔石说，小平十分强调学习和熟悉马克思主义理论，特别提醒全党，要防止一些同志，特别是新上来的中青年同志在日益复杂的斗争中迷失方向。在这次制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，我们党从整体上说，是经受住了考验的，大多数党员、干部表现是好的，但也确有一部分党员、干部立场不坚定，旗帜不鲜明，甚至迷失方向，犯了严重的错误甚至罪行。这些人中，除了有的本来就是政治上的投机分子或反动分子以外，不少都是由于政治素质、理论素质差，又被资产阶级自由化思潮搞乱了思想，以致在关键时刻经不起考验。因此，在全党加强马克思主义基本理论的学习，是非常重要的。
    乔石希望大家认真读一些马列的书，读一些毛主席的书，还要认真读一些邓小平同志的著作，也尽可能读一些其他老一辈无产阶级革命家的著作。要运用所学到的基本理论，研究在建设有中国特色的社会主义中出现的新问题，探讨新的解决方法。
    中央党校副校长邢贲思主持了开学典礼，常务副校长薛驹也讲了话。
