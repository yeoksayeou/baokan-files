Actively Advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence

In December 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai, while receiving an Indian delegation visiting China, first proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In June 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of India and Burma, visited these countries. The premiers of China and India, and China and Burma, in their joint statements, formally proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as guidelines for international relations. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, proposed and advocated by China, stand in stark contrast to the "might makes right" practices of the old international relations. They established behavioral norms for China's relations with foreign countries and for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among all countries, helping to create an atmosphere of world peace and opposing imperialist aggression and interference policies.

Initially, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were proposed as guidelines for relations between countries with different social systems. However, subsequent events have shown that these five principles are equally applicable to countries with the same social system. On November 1, 1956, the Chinese government clearly stated that the mutual relations among socialist countries should be based even more on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

### 积极倡导和平共处五项原则

　　积极倡导和平共处五项原则
    1953年12月，周恩来总理在接见印度一访华代表团时，第一次提出了和平共处五项原则。1954年6月，周恩来总理应邀访问了印度和缅甸。中印、中缅双方总理在联合声明中，正式倡议将和平共处五项原则作为国际关系的准则。和平共处五项原则是：互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。
    中国提出和倡导的和平共处五项原则，同旧的国际关系中“弱肉强食”的行径针锋相对，为中国同外国，以及世界各国彼此之间实现和平共处和友好合作确立了行为准则，有助于创造世界和平的气氛，反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉政策。
    和平共处五项原则，开始时是作为处理不同社会制度国家之间的关系准则。但后来的事实表明，这五项原则同样适用于社会制度相同的国家。1956年11月1日，中国政府明确指出，社会主义国家间的相互关系更应该建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上。
