Observation Platform

Recently, we conducted a survey of more than 20 directly affiliated units of the Su County region in our province regarding the construction of their party organizations. We found that the phenomenon of missing key party leaders is quite common.

For instance, the regional committee office, the organization department, and other five major departments are currently missing seven leaders. The regional party committee has eight sub-committees, including those for party affairs and political-legal affairs, with only four appointed secretaries (one of whom is part-time), but the official quota is only two. Among these, the financial and commercial sub-committee has over 1,200 party members but only one full-time secretary. This comrade, due to illness, can only work half a day each day. The secretary of the economic commission sub-committee has been half-paralyzed since 1984 and has not attended work since then. Additionally, the sub-committees for party affairs and agriculture have only one full-time deputy secretary, who also handles a large amount of daily administrative work in the unit, making it difficult to focus on party building.

The decline in the status and role of party organizations in enterprises is even more pronounced, with almost all specialized party cadres being reduced or eliminated. The Su County Cement Plant originally had 15 party and political cadres, but now only one party committee secretary and one party committee secretary remain, and this secretary has written three reports requesting a transfer last year. To strengthen economic construction, we must not overlook party organizational construction, especially the construction of the cadre team.

　　党委负责人缺额　党组织怎么活动
    前一段，我们调查了我省宿县地区直属的20多个单位党组织建设情况，发现党委负责人缺额现象较普遍。
    如地委办公室、组织部等5个主要部门的负责人，现共缺额7人；地直党委下设党群、政法等8个分党委，共配备正副书记4名（兼职1名），但正式编制只有2名。其中，财贸口分党委共有党员1200多名，但仅配1名专职书记。这位同志由于身体有病，每天只能上半天班。经委口分党委书记由于身体半瘫痪，自1984年以来，从未上过班。另外，党群口、农口等分党委，仅有1名专职副书记，还承担了所在单位大量的日常事务工作，无法集中力量抓党的建设。
    企业党组织的地位和作用下降尤为突出，做党务工作的专职干部几乎被减裁殆尽。宿县地区水泥厂原党务政工干部15名，现在只剩下1名党委书记、1名党委秘书，而这名秘书去年3次写报告要求调换工作。要加强经济建设，绝不能忽视党的组织建设，特别是加强干部队伍建设。
