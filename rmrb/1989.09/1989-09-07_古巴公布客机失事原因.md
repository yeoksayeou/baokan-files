Cuba's Director of Civil Aviation, Asevedo, stated on the 6th that adverse weather conditions and the pilot's erroneous decision were the causes of the largest air disaster in Cuban history, which occurred on the 3rd.

Asevedo said that the pilot of the Cuban Airlines flight from Havana to Milan, Italy, decided to take off on the evening of the 3rd despite the adverse weather conditions and the airport staff's advice to the contrary. As a result, the aircraft crashed into a residential area in the southern suburbs of Havana after being hit by a strong gust of wind.
