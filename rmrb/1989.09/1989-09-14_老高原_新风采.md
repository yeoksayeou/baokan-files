The Old Plateau, New Prosperity

Salt Lake Expert Zhang Pengxi

Zhang Pengxi, currently the director and senior researcher at the Qinghai Salt Lake Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, graduated from Beijing Geological Institute in 1956. In his volunteer form, he wrote: first, Qaidam Basin; second, Qaidam Basin; third, Qaidam Basin. For over 30 years, this salt lake expert born by the Haihe River has traversed every salt lake on the plateau. He organized and oversaw the compilation of "Qaidam Salt Lakes," the first relatively systematic salt lake monograph in China, which won the National Science Conference Award. Zhang Pengxi also received the first "Zhu Kezhen Field Scientific Work Award."

New-Type Herdsman Lafu Dan

In Haiyuan Village, Daotanghe Township, Huzhu County, near Qinghai Lake, there is a middle-aged Tibetan herdsman named Lafu Dan who has become a "news figure" on the grasslands in recent years. Inspired by the reform tide, this local herdsman has taken the lead in developing diversified operations and entered the commodity economy first. In recent years, his cattle and sheep have increased significantly, and his diversified operations have an annual net income of over 30,000 yuan. He is now leading the villagers to remove their poverty caps.

Commercial Labor Model Li Xiujie

In a vegetable stall on North Street, Xining City, a simple middle-aged female salesperson has gained the praise of many customers with her silent dedication. Her name is Li Xiujie. For more than 20 years since coming to Qinghai from her hometown in Henan, she has been dedicated to commercial work and sincerely served the citizens. In addition to standing at the counter every day, she has also used hundreds of rest days to deliver vegetables to the doors of five-guarantee elderly people and customers in difficulty. This Communist Party member has been rated as a national first-class labor model in the commercial system.

Model Party Member He Xianjue

"You have done an excellent job in the Northwest, your deeds are vivid and moving, you should continue to take root in the plateau and make new contributions to the modernization of our military's national defense."

This is the warm encouragement from Yang Shangkun to He Xianjue, a senior engineer in a certain unit of the Qinghai garrison. In the early 1960s, after graduating from university, He Xianjue joined the army and came to Qinghai from Hubei. For 25 years, he has been tackling key problems in the deep mountains at an altitude of over 3,000 meters, and together with his comrades-in-arms, he has achieved 17 scientific research results and participated in the development of components related to national defense cutting-edge projects many times. The General Political Department and other departments have awarded him the titles of model Communist Party member who takes root in the plateau and devotes himself to national defense science and technology, and second-class hero, among others.
