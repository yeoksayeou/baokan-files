Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 15th.

The Deputy Director and Spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Tang Shubei, today stated in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters that the Chinese government's policy of "One Country, Two Systems, Peaceful Reunification" towards Taiwan remains unchanged, as do its economic and trade policies towards Taiwan and its policies to promote exchanges and interactions between people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

Tang Shubei reviewed the exchanges between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in recent years. He said that after significant developments last year, this year has seen further important progress. According to incomplete statistics, from January to August this year, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the mainland for purposes such as visiting relatives and tourism reached over 370,000, an increase of 23% compared to the same period last year. Since mid-November 1988, over 2,100 people have been approved to travel to Taiwan for medical emergencies or funerals. For the first time in 40 years, a sports team from Taiwan participated in an athletic competition in Beijing. To date, 135 athletes from Taiwan have officially participated in five sports events on the mainland. Despite various obstacles and difficulties, the economic and trade relations between the two sides have continued to develop due to the objective mutual benefits and complementary nature of their economies. From January to June, the total trade volume between the two sides exceeded $17.4 billion, a 57% increase compared to the same period last year. Taiwanese investments on the mainland have also continued to grow. In the first half of this year, Fujian Province alone approved 135 joint ventures with a total investment of $124 million. Tang Shubei pointed out that the momentum of developing relations between the two sides is good, reflecting the strong desire of the people on both sides for exchanges and closer relations.

He reiterated that the Chinese government's policy of "One Country, Two Systems, Peaceful Reunification" towards Taiwan remains unchanged, as do its economic and trade policies towards Taiwan and its policies to promote exchanges and interactions between people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The rights of Taiwanese people in the mainland in terms of economic and trade activities, investments, travel, and other matters will continue to be protected according to laws and regulations. At the same time, to adapt to the increasingly developing situation of exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, relevant departments of the State Council, in conjunction with the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, have already or are in the process of drafting relevant regulations to strengthen the leadership and management of various exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, ensuring that the exchanges between the two sides can develop in a healthy, normal, and broad manner.

In his remarks, Tang Shubei criticized the recent inappropriate attitudes and measures taken by the authorities in Taiwan towards exchanges between the people on both sides. He pointed out that we welcome the measures taken by the authorities in Taiwan in recent times to open up exchanges for teachers and staff to visit the mainland, as well as to facilitate mail and telephone communications, which objectively benefit exchanges between the people on both sides. However, the authorities in Taiwan still emphasize "hostile consciousness" and insist on the "three nos" stance. Since the disturbances and riots in Beijing, they have repeatedly expressed support for the few troublemakers who instigated the counter-revolutionary riots and have colluded with and supported criminals who are wanted for their involvement in counter-revolutionary riots. They have also used sea and air drifts, as well as postal services, to send reactionary psychological warfare materials to the mainland, using various exchanges across the Taiwan Strait to spread reactionary thoughts against the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. The authorities in Taiwan's actions, which go against the will of the people on both sides and defy the tide of the times, are a hindrance and disruption to the normal exchanges and interactions between the people on both sides and have naturally been condemned by the people on both sides. He said, we sincerely hope that the authorities in Taiwan will prioritize the interests of the nation and the people, abandon their inappropriate and erroneous stance of hostility towards the government of the motherland and attempting to subvert the socialist system on the mainland, stop actions and statements that are detrimental to exchanges between the people on both sides and the reunification of the motherland, and do more practical things to promote exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and achieve peaceful reunification.

    国务院台办发言人重申
    “一国两制、和平统一”的对台方针不变
    新华社北京9月15日电　国务院台湾事务办公室副主任、发言人唐树备今天对新华社记者发表谈话时重申，中国政府对于“一国两制、和平统一”的对台方针不变，对台经贸政策不变，促进海峡两岸人员交往和各项交流的政策不变。
    唐树备回顾了海峡两岸人民近年来的交往。他说，两岸人民往来和各项交流在去年有较大发展的基础上，今年又有重要的发展。据不完全统计，今年1至8月，台胞来大陆探亲旅游等入境数为37万多人次，去年同期为30万人次，比去年同期增加23％。自1988年11月中旬以来，被批准赴台探病奔丧的有2100多人。台湾地区的体育团队40年来第一次来北京参加亚洲地区的体育比赛。迄今，已有5个运动项目的135名台湾地区运动员来大陆正式参加比赛。由于两岸经济客观上存在着互利、互补的特点，因此，尽管存在着种种障碍和困难，但今年以来两岸经贸关系还是继续得到发展。1至6月两岸贸易总额超过17.4亿美元，比去年同期增长57％。台湾同胞在大陆的投资也继续增长。仅福建省今年1至6月批准的合资企业就有135家，合资协议金额为1.24亿美元。唐树备指出，两岸民间关系的发展势头是好的，反映了两岸人民要求往来、密切各方面关系的强烈愿望。
    他重申，中国政府关于“一国两制、和平统一”的对台方针不变，对台经贸政策不变，促进两岸人员交往和各项交流的政策不变。对台胞在大陆的经贸、投资、旅行等，将一如既往地根据法律和法规予以保护。同时，为适应海峡两岸交流日益发展的形势，国务院有关部委会同国务院台办，已经或正在拟定有关规定，以加强对海峡两岸各项交流的领导和管理，使两岸之间的交流能够健康、正常、广泛地发展。
    唐树备在谈话中批评了台湾当局最近一个时期来对两岸人民交往所采取的不合时宜的态度和措施。他指出，我们对台湾当局近来在开放教职员工来大陆探亲、通邮、通话等方面采取的客观上有利于两岸人民交往的举措，持欢迎态度。但是，台湾当局仍强调“敌对意识”和坚持“三不”立场，在北京发生动乱、暴乱以来，对策动反革命暴乱的极少数坏人，一再表示“支援”，拉拢、支持因从事反革命暴乱被通缉的犯罪分子；还通过海漂、空飘、邮电向大陆传送反动心战品，利用两岸各项交流散发反对中国共产党、反对社会主义制度等反动思想。台湾当局的这些违反两岸民意、逆时代潮流的不识事务的行径，是对两岸人民正常往来和交流的一种阻挠和破坏，也理所当然地受到了两岸人民的谴责。他说，我们真诚地希望台湾当局以国家民族利益为重，放弃其敌视祖国政府、妄图颠覆大陆社会主义制度的不合时宜的错误立场，停止不利于两岸人民交往、不利于祖国统一的言行，为促进两岸交流、实现和平统一多做些实实在在的事情。
