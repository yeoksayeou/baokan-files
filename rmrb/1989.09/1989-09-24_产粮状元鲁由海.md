In the lakeside area of Dongting Lake in Hunan, there is a grain production and sales champion named Lu Youhai. He leads his family of 11 members and 7 laborers in contracting 16 mu of paddy fields and 138 mu of barren lake fields from the village. From 1985 to 1988, he produced a total of 288,000 kilograms of rice, selling 260,000 kilograms to the state. Each person contributed an average of 5,795 kilograms of grain to the state annually, which is 19 times the local average, making him a renowned grain production and sales champion in the Dongting Lake area.

In Changde City, Dingcheng District, Chongtian Lake Township, Chongtian Lake Village, there is a 500-mu barren lake area. Before 1985, this land was contracted by more than 80 households. Although the soil is fertile, due to its low-lying and remote location, scattered plots, poor drainage, and frequent waterlogging, the land often failed to produce a harvest every three years. Everyone regarded it as a burden. In March 1985, the village committee decided to take back this barren lake and put it up for contract. Lu Youhai, after much thought, decided to contract the land, believing that the current policies encouraged grain production and that his family had the conditions to contract more land. With a burst of enthusiasm, he boldly took on the contract for 138 mu of lake fields.

Upon returning home, Lu Youhai shared his decision with his family, which sparked a heated debate. Lu Youhai considered the advantages: although the barren lake fields had poor conditions, the soil was fertile, and scientific cultivation could achieve high and stable yields. Moreover, the state encouraged skilled farmers to contract more land. With these advantages and policy support, he had nothing to fear. He presented these favorable factors to persuade his family and calculated the potential income: if they contracted 150 mu of lake fields with a yield of 350 kilograms per mu, the total production would be over 50,000 kilograms, earning more than 10,000 yuan. Not only would the family become wealthy, but they could also contribute over 40,000 kilograms of grain to the state. After calculating the benefits, the family agreed and the next day, they started working on the lake fields.

To quickly level the barren lake, Lu Youhai borrowed 2,000 yuan and added his savings to purchase two small diesel engines and two cultivators. To ensure timely transplanting, the entire family worked day and night, regardless of weather, for nearly 500 workdays. They dredged five 700-meter-long drainage and irrigation ditches, opened two new drainage ditches, raised 1,500 meters of embankments, leveled 50 mu of fields, and transplanted seedlings on over 100 mu of lake fields.

To solve technical problems in rice cultivation, Lu Youhai humbly learned from experts and consulted with agricultural technicians. Sometimes he went to agricultural stations to learn, other times he invited technicians to his fields for guidance, and even asked questions when he met them on the road. He also subscribed to agricultural technology newspapers such as "Hunan Science and Technology" and "Hunan Agriculture" to solve practical production issues. Due to timely transplanting and scientific management, the first year was a great success. The 154 mu of rice fields produced 70,000 kilograms of rice, more than the total production of a production brigade during the "Great Leap Forward"; the yield per mu was 455 kilograms, three times higher than the previous "waiting for the heavens" period; and 67,500 kilograms of commercial grain were sold to the state, earning over 30,000 yuan.

Since 1986, Lu Youhai has continued to increase investment, improve production conditions, and enhance scientific farming. He successively purchased a water pump, a threshing machine, and a small diesel engine. He also invested over 200 workdays and 500 yuan to dig 3,000 meters of ditches, lower the groundwater level, and reduce waterlogging disasters. To improve soil fertility, he combined land use with soil improvement, implementing straw return for all single-season rice. In 1988, he boldly experimented with chemical weeding on 30 mu of rice fields, and this year, he fully implemented chemical weeding. In 1986 and 1987, he produced a total of 150,000 kilograms of rice, with a yield of 487 kilograms per mu, an increase of 32 kilograms compared to 1985. In September 1988, heavy rains flooded the low-lying lake fields, submerging 154 mu of single-season rice and late-season rice. However, due to connected ditches and timely drainage, the annual rice production still reached 67,500 kilograms, with a yield of 439 kilograms per mu.

Making a living from the land is difficult! This is a common sentiment among farmers. However, since 1985, Lu Youhai has led his family in contracting 154 mu of lake fields, working diligently, and with the strong support of the Party and government, he has become wealthy through farming. From 1985 to 1988, he paid 260,000 yuan in collective contract fees, with a family grain income of nearly 100,000 yuan, and an average annual income of 2,273 yuan per person. The high returns from developing barren lakes for grain production have greatly attracted nearby villagers. In 1985, each mu of lake field had a levy of 30 yuan, and no one was willing to contract it. Now, with a levy of over 100 yuan per mu, people are eager to invest and manage. The 500-mu barren lake area has been fully developed and utilized, turning the previous burden into wealth.

    产粮状元鲁由海
    湘长定
    在湖南洞庭湖之滨，有个产粮、售粮“状元”鲁由海，他带领全家11口人7个劳力，承包村里16亩水田和138亩荒湖田。从1985年到1988年，共生产稻谷28.8万公斤，向国家交售26万公斤，人均每年向国家贡献粮食5795公斤，是当地人均售粮数的19倍，成为洞庭湖区有名的产粮、售粮状元。
    常德市鼎城区冲天湖乡冲天湖村有片500多亩的荒湖滩，1985年以前由80多个农户承包。这里泥土虽肥，但由于地势低洼偏远、田块七零八落，沟渠不通，涝害频繁，三年两不收，大家都把它当包袱。1985年3月，村委会决定将这片荒湖收回，张榜发包。鲁由海左思右想觉得眼下党和政府鼓励多种田、多打粮，自家有条件再包上百把亩田。心头一热便毅然揭了榜，包下了138亩湖田。
    回到家里，鲁由海把这事一讲，就像往热油锅里加了瓢水——炸开了锅。鲁由海思忖开了：荒湖田条件虽差，但肥力足，通过科学耕种是可以高产稳产的。再说，国家鼓励种田能手多包田。有优势作基础，有政策来“保驾”，怕什么？他把这些有利因素摆出来说服家里人，还算了一笔账：如果承包150多亩湖田，亩产就算350公斤，总产就有5万多公斤，收入能达1万多元。不仅家里可富起来，还可向国家交4万多公斤粮食。一算账，全家人开了窍，铁了心，第二天就开进了这片湖田。
    为了尽快把荒湖平整出来，鲁由海心一横，贷了2000元款，搭上老本凑齐3500元，买了两台小型柴油机和两台耕整机。为了赶上插秧季节，全家人起早贪黑，歇人不歇机，风雨无阻，日夜苦干，用了近500个工日疏通了5条700米的排灌沟渠，新开了两条排水沟，加高了1500多米长的防水堤，平整田地50亩，把100多亩湖田全部及时插上了秧。
    为了解决水稻栽培技术问题，鲁由海虚心向内行学习，向农技干部请教，有时到农科站去学，有时把农技干部请到家里田边指导，就是路上碰到也要问上几句。他还订阅了《湖南科技报》、《湖南农业》等农技报刊，通过学习解决了不少生产实际问题。由于栽插及时，科学培管，头年就旗开得胜，154亩稻田产稻谷7万公斤，比“大呼隆”时一个生产队的总产还多；单产455公斤，比原来“望天收”时提高了3倍；向国家交售商品粮6.75万公斤，总收入3万多元。
    1986年以来，他继续在增加投入、改善生产条件和提高科学种田水平上下功夫，先后购置了一台水泵，一台脱粒机和一台小型柴油机。还投入200多个工日、500多元钱，开沟3000多米，降低地下水位，减轻渍涝灾害。为了提高土壤肥力，实行用地与养地相结合，一季稻全部实行撩穗收割、稻草还田。1988年他还大胆进行了30亩稻田化学除草的新尝试，今年全面实行化学除草。1986、1987两年共生产稻谷15万公斤，单产达到487公斤，比1985年增加32公斤。1988年9月间连降暴雨，湖田地势低洼，四周积水下泄，154亩一季稻和晚稻全部被淹。但由于沟渠相通，排涝及时，全年水稻总产仍达6.75万公斤，单产达到439公斤。
    靠地生财难！这是当前农村广大农民的普遍感叹。然而，1985年以来，鲁由海带领全家承包154亩湖田，辛勤劳动，在党和政府的大力支持下，靠种地治穷致了富。1985年到1988年的4年间，上交集体承包款2.6万元，家庭粮食纯收入近10万元，人均每年收入2273元。开发荒湖种粮的较高效益对邻近村民产生了极大的吸引力。1985年湖田每亩提留30元还没人愿意承包，如今每亩提留100多元，人们却竞相投资经营。500多亩荒湖滩地全部得到开发利用，先前的包袱变成了财富。
