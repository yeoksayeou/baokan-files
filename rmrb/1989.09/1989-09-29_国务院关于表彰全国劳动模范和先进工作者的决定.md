Under the guidance of the line, principles, and policies set forth by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of all ethnic groups in China have taken economic construction as the center, adhered to the four cardinal principles, persisted in reform and opening up, worked hard, and contributed their wisdom and strength to accelerate socialist construction. This has brought about tremendous changes in our country's appearance and achieved great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. In all sectors and fields, a large number of advanced and model figures have emerged.

To further mobilize the people of the entire country to boost their spirits, unite as one, and better implement the policies of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening reforms, strive to achieve the goals set forth by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and give full play to the role of advanced and model figures as backbones, pioneers, and bridges in the four modernizations, the State Council decides to confer the honorable title of National Labor Model on 1987 comrades including Tu Xuexin, and the honorable title of National Advanced Worker on 803 comrades including Peng Shixiong.

The State Council hopes that the comrades who have been awarded the honorable titles of National Labor Model and National Advanced Worker will remain humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, maintain and carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, selflessness, and striving for progress, and make new and greater contributions to the cause of socialist modernization in China.

The State Council calls on the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at all levels in all sectors and fields across the country to learn from the National Labor Models and Advanced Workers, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, adhere to the basic line of "one center, two basic points" set forth by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, strive to build socialist material civilization and promote socialist spiritual civilization, and work hard to revitalize China and achieve the four modernizations.
