From September 9th, citizens of Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, will have the opportunity to taste Beijing roast duck and other delicious Chinese dishes. The long-awaited first Chinese restaurant in the GDR, the "Beijing Restaurant," officially opened in Berlin yesterday.

The opening of the "Beijing Restaurant" in Berlin is part of a cooperative project between Beijing and Berlin, as stipulated in relevant agreements. The restaurant is funded by the Berlin Kronen Hotel and managed by two staff members from the Beijing Hotel, along with 12 chefs and 5 waiters. Among the 12 chefs, there are 2 senior chefs and the rest are first-class chefs. After opening, the restaurant will serve 116 dishes from the Beijing, Sichuan, and Yangzhou cuisines, as well as dumplings and spring rolls.

The "Beijing Restaurant" is located in the modern commercial district of Leipzig Street in Berlin. Inside, lanterns hang high, red pillars stand tall, and Chinese calligraphy adorns the walls. In one corner, a bronze dragon seems ready to leap, symbolizing the rise of the Chinese nation. The decor and layout have distinct Chinese characteristics, and all the tableware is made of Jingdezhen porcelain. The restaurant has two floors, upstairs and downstairs, with a total capacity to accommodate 135 diners at the same time.
