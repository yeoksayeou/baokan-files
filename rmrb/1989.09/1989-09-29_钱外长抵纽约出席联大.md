Foreign Minister Qian Arrives in New York to Attend UN General Assembly

United Nations, September 27 (Xinhua) — Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is leading the Chinese delegation to the 44th UN General Assembly, arrived in New York this afternoon.

Foreign Minister Qian arrived in New York directly from Geneva after concluding his visits to four Middle Eastern countries. This is the first time a Chinese foreign minister has attended the UN General Assembly since the suppression of the protests. This has attracted attention from people here.

Upon arrival, Foreign Minister Qian stated that he would deliver a speech at the General Assembly to "explain China's views on the current international situation and our stance on a series of major international issues." During his stay in New York, Foreign Minister Qian will also hold meetings with approximately forty prime ministers or foreign ministers from various countries and meet with some American friends. He will be invited to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations and will attend a breakfast meeting hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations in his honor.
