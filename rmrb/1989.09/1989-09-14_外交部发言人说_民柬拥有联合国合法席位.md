Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Says the Democratic Kampuchea Holds the Legitimate Seat in the United Nations

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 14th: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing stated this afternoon at a press conference that the Democratic Kampuchea rightfully holds the legitimate seat in the United Nations.

A reporter asked: Some people advocate for leaving the seat of Cambodia in the United Nations vacant until a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem is reached. What is China's stance on this?

Li Zhaoxing said: The Democratic Kampuchea is a formal member of the United Nations. The coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, is the only legitimate government of the Cambodian people. The Democratic Kampuchea rightfully holds the legitimate seat in the United Nations. Any suggestion or advocacy to leave the seat of Cambodia in the United Nations vacant is absurd and unacceptable.

    外交部发言人说
    民柬拥有联合国合法席位
    新华社北京9月14日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天下午在新闻发布会上指出，民主柬埔寨理所当然地拥有在联合国的合法席位。
    有记者问：有人主张在达成一项全面解决柬埔寨问题的方案之前，将柬埔寨在联合国的席位空缺。中国对此持何态度？
    李肇星说：民主柬埔寨是联合国的正式成员国，以西哈努克亲王为主席的民柬联合政府是柬埔寨人民唯一合法的政府。民主柬埔寨理所当然地拥有在联合国的合法席位。任何要求空缺柬埔寨在联合国席位的论调和主张都是荒唐的，不能接受的。
