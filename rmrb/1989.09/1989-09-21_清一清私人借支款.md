According to statistics from Yixing City in Jiangsu Province, the total amount of money borrowed by individuals from collective entities in all 48 townships in the city amounts to 54.99 million yuan. This is no small sum.

Currently, many units are feeling a shortage of funds. These units might as well check to see if the public funds borrowed by individuals have been repaid, and how much public money is still in private hands.

Originally, it is acceptable for individuals to borrow a portion of public funds through proper financial procedures for official business or urgent needs. The problem lies in the fact that some people delay repayment and occupy the funds for extended periods. You borrow a bit, he borrows a bit, and when aggregated in an enterprise or unit, it becomes a significant amount, affecting normal operations. This is essentially an act of "eating from the public trough."

When national and collective funds are occupied by individuals for extended periods, it not only causes the funds to be unable to circulate normally, artificially exacerbating the shortage of funds, but also requires the public to pay interest to the bank annually. For example, Yixing City alone has to pay 9.9 million yuan in interest annually for the overdue loans of more than 50 million yuan. On the other hand, this practice also disrupts financial discipline. In some places, many of those who owe public funds are individuals that units dare not offend. Among the more than 30,000 people in Yixing City who owe public funds, there are 1,156 factory-level cadres and 6,894 supply personnel. Some people use the borrowed funds to squander, even building private residences and engaging in commercial activities. Currently, it is necessary to rectify financial discipline and manage funds properly, and it is crucial to tackle the collection of personal borrowed funds.

In the past, collection of overdue loans has been done annually, but often the efforts were more bark than bite, with minimal results. The key issue is a lack of resolve and effective measures. Is there really no way to deal with those who owe public funds? There are indeed ways. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Party Congress, the Yixing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yixing Municipal Government decided to tackle this issue. Each township established a collection leadership group, and personnel were assigned to form collection teams. Many units publicly exposed the overdue loan situations and posted them on walls. Some townships even stipulated that whoever lent out the money must collect it within a specified time, and if they fail to collect it, the lender's salary will be deducted. It is understood that from August 5 to August 25, overdue loans totaling 50.63 million yuan were collected in just 20 days, accounting for 92% of the total amount to be collected.

It seems that as long as one is serious and does things thoroughly, one can achieve results. The work of rectifying financial order and collecting personal overdue loans is the same.

    清一清私人借支款
    江溪
    据江苏省宜兴市统计，全市48个乡镇个人向集体借支的欠款达5499万元。这是一个不小的数目。
    现在，许多单位都感到资金紧缺。这些单位不妨查一查，你那里私人借支的公款是否还了，留在私人手中的公款到底有多少？
    本来，私人因公干或急需，通过正当的财务手续向公家借支部分款项，是可以的。问题在于，有些人事后欠拖不还，长期占用。你欠一点，他欠一点，集中到一个企业、一个单位，就是个不大不小的数字，就会影响到正常的经营活动。这实质上是“吃公家”的表现。
    国家和集体的资金被个人长期占用，一方面使资金不能正常运转，人为地加剧资金紧缺程度，公家每年还须为此向银行支付利息。即以宜兴市为例，5000余万元欠款一年须付息990万元。另一方面，这种做法也扰乱了财经纪律。一些地方，拖欠公款者有不少是单位上得罪不起的人物。宜兴市3万多拖欠公款者，有1156名厂级干部、6894名供销人员。有的人利用借支款，挥霍浪费，甚至用来建私人住宅，经商做买卖。当前，整顿财经纪律，管好用好资金，很有必要抓一抓私人借支款的清收工作。
    清收欠款，以往也年年搞，但往往雷声大，雨点小，收效甚微。关键是决心不大，缺乏切实有力的措施。对于那些拖欠公款者难道真的没办法了？办法还是有的。中共宜兴市委、宜兴市政府在十三届四中全会以后，下决心把这项工作抓起来。各乡镇都成立清收领导小组，抽调人员组成收款队。许多单位将欠款情况公开曝光，上墙公布。有的乡镇还规定，谁借出的钱，由谁限期收回，若收不回，扣发出借人的工资。据了解，从8月5日至8月25日，20天就收回欠款5063万元，占应清收总额的92％。
    看来，做任何事情，只要动真格的，丁是丁卯是卯地去做，就能收到成效。整顿财务秩序、清收个人欠款的工作，也同样如此。
