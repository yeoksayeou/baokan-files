Japanese tourist Morinaga Yoshihisa engaged in activities inconsistent with his status as a tourist, and Shanghai public security authorities have decided to shorten his stay in China. This morning, Morinaga Yoshihisa left Shanghai under supervision.

On September 10, 26-year-old Morinaga Yoshihisa entered China via Shanghai Hongqiao Airport with a tourist visa. He smuggled in a batch of reactionary printed materials, including "Democracy in China" edited by defector Yan Jiaqi. During his stay in Shanghai, he made large banners and planned to hold a series of activities inconsistent with his tourist status, such as demonstrating in public places for the so-called "June 4th 100-day memorial." Shanghai public security authorities lawfully summoned him and decided to shorten his stay in China.
