The Ministry of Education has announced that the job allocation for this year's graduates of undergraduate and graduate programs has been largely completed. This year, a total of 488,000 undergraduate graduates and 36,000 graduate students were allocated by the state. They have all left their schools and training units and are heading to their respective workplaces.

According to relevant departments of the Ministry of Education, the job allocation for this year's graduates has been relatively smooth, and the policies for graduate allocation have been well implemented. Of the undergraduate graduates, 82.7% were allocated to local regions, and 17.3% to central departments. For graduate students, 52% were allocated to local regions, and 48% to central departments. The proportion allocated to local regions has increased compared to last year. For sectors such as energy, transportation, communications, light industry and textiles, raw materials, and agriculture and forestry, in addition to prioritizing graduates from affiliated institutions, the Ministry of Education has also given priority to graduates from its 36 directly affiliated schools. This ensures that key sectors are prioritized in terms of both quantity and quality. Graduates from local institutions have 80% to 90% allocated to grassroots units at the county level and below, while the majority of graduates from institutions affiliated with central industrial departments have been sent to the front lines of production and construction. Graduate students have also started to move away from the single direction of teaching and research towards application-oriented departments.

It is understood that this year's job allocation plan is more in line with reality and has been more meticulously executed. The phenomena of schools reducing allocations, employing units refusing to accept graduates, and graduates refusing to comply with allocations have significantly decreased. Local institutions have basically eliminated the phenomenon of returning graduates, and the number of graduates returned by departmental institutions has been reduced by half compared to previous years.

    50多万高校毕业生分配工作顺利结束
    本报北京9月25日讯　国家教委提供的消息表明，今年毕业的大学本专科学生和研究生的分配派遣工作已大体结束。今年由国家统一分配的大学本专科毕业生共48.8万人，毕业研究生3.6万人，现在他们都离开了学校和培养单位，奔赴各自工作岗位。
    据国家教委有关部门介绍，这届毕业生分配工作进行得比较顺利，毕业分配的方针政策贯彻得较好。今年本专科毕业生分配总计划中，分配到地方的占82.7％，分配到中央部门的占17.3％；研究生分到地方的占52％，分到中央部门的占48％。分给地方的比例较去年增加。对能源、交通、通讯、轻工纺织、原材料、农林等部门，除所属院校的毕业生优先满足本部门需要外，国家教委直属的36所学校毕业生也优先给予照顾。这样在数量和质量上都优先保证了重点部门。地方院校的毕业生80％至90％分到了地县以下基层单位，中央工业部委所属院校的毕业生绝大多数到了生产建设第一线。毕业研究生也改变过去那种教学科研的单一去向，开始向应用部门充实。
    据了解，今年毕业分配计划工作比较切合实际，做得又较细致，学校减派和用人单位拒收及毕业生拒不服从分配的现象明显减少。地方院校基本没有退人现象，部委院校也比往年减少1／2。
