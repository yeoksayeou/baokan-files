The Second Military Medical University, which is the same age as the People's Republic of China, has over the past decade completed 150,000 outpatient visits annually while producing nearly 20,000 qualified personnel for the military's medical services. The university has also achieved a number of research results that have garnered attention both domestically and internationally.

Since the late 1950s, the university has emphasized the integration of medicine and technology, achieving a series of groundbreaking results. In 1965, the university developed the first domestically produced artificial heart valve, a spherical valve, and successfully performed a heart valve replacement surgery on a female patient named Xu Shubao. The patient has since lived healthily for 24 years, making her the longest-surviving patient of this type in the world today. The university also proposed the new theory of the anatomical division of the liver into lobes and segments for Chinese people and was the first in the world to successfully perform a surgery on the middle lobe of the liver in 1963. In the 1970s, they developed a new generation of artificial heart valves, the disc-shaped valve, and successfully removed a massive liver hemangioma weighing 18 kilograms from a farmer from Anhui.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Second Military Medical University has collaborated with over 100 institutions in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country. They have also established academic exchanges, research collaborations, and joint training programs for graduate students with universities and research institutions in 18 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Over the past 10 years, the university has achieved 738 award-winning results, including 6 national invention awards and 7 national science and technology progress awards. Recently, young attending physician Guo Yajun, under the guidance of his mentor, collaborated with other colleagues to achieve an internationally advanced level in the comprehensive immunotherapy for liver cancer. He was recently named the only "military science and technology elite" among the top 10 "science and technology elites" in Shanghai.

    二军医大育人科研双丰收
    近10年培养近2万合格人才
    全校有738项科研成果获奖
    本报上海9月27日电　与共和国同龄的第二军医大学近10年在每年完成150万人次门诊任务的同时，为全军输送了近2万名卫生事业的合格人才，取得了一批国内外瞩目的研究成果。
    从五十年代末起，这所学校就重视走医药与理工结合的路子，取得了一批开创性的重大成果。1965年研制出第一个国产人造心脏球型瓣膜，首次为女患者许淑宝成功地施行心脏瓣膜置换手术，患者至今已健康生活了24个春秋，成为当今世界上同类患者存活最长的一个；在国内首次提出中国人肝脏解剖分叶分段的新理论，并于1963年率先在世界上冲破肝脏“禁区”，在中肝叶手术成功。七十年代，他们又研制出新一代人工心瓣——碟型瓣膜；为一位安徽农民切除了“世界之最”的重达18公斤的特大肝脏海绵状血管瘤。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，二军医大先后与全国二十几个省、市共100多个单位开展协作研究，与美、日、联邦德国等18个国家和地区的大学、研究机构建立了学术交流、科研协作和联合培养研究生的关系。10年中取得获奖成果738项，其中国家发明奖6项，国家科技进步奖7项。最近，年轻的主治军医郭亚军在导师指导下，与其他同志合作，肝癌免疫综合疗法达到国际先进水平。日前，他被评为上海10名“科技精英”中唯一的“军人科技精英”。
