Beijing has twice selected "Ten Major Buildings" in the 40 years since the founding of the nation.

The first selection was in 1959. The "Ten Major Buildings" chosen were: the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of Chinese History, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, the Nationalities Cultural Palace, the Beijing Hotel, the Workers' Stadium, Beijing Railway Station, the Overseas Chinese House, and the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

The second selection was in 1988, when the "Ten Major Buildings of the 1980s" were chosen: the new building of the Beijing Library, the China International Exhibition Center, the Central Television Tower, the Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal, the Beijing Hotel, the Great View Garden, the Longchamp Hotel, the China Theater, the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, and the Dongsi Station of the Beijing Subway.

The selections of "Ten Major Buildings" in the 1950s and 1980s were quite different, and there are some interesting points to note:

The "Ten Major Buildings" of the 1950s were not actually selected through a competitive process. At that time, only these ten projects were completed to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. On the other hand, the "Ten Major Buildings" of the 1980s were selected through a rigorous evaluation process. In recent years, Beijing has completed various types of buildings totaling 10 million square meters each year. With so many new and beautifully designed buildings, it was quite challenging to select just ten. In the end, a democratic voting process was used, with tens of thousands of Beijing residents casting their votes to determine the winners.

In the 1950s, Beijing constructed the ten major projects for the National Day celebrations using a mass campaign approach, with the support of the entire nation. In the 1980s, many of Beijing's new buildings seemed to appear "quietly" on the streets of the capital. Forty years after the founding of the nation, constructing a few tall buildings no longer required the support of the entire nation.

There is also a fundamental difference: the ten major projects of the 1950s were all essential projects that addressed urgent needs, providing "timely assistance." Take the Great Hall of the People, for example. At that time, the central government did not even have a place to hold meetings of the people's representatives. Consider Beijing Railway Station: if it had not been built, Beijing would have been inaccessible. On the other hand, the ten major buildings of the 1980s can be seen as projects that further "added flowers to brocade" for the capital of our republic, with most of them adding to China's "flowers of opening up to the outside world."

### 首都两度确定十大建筑  其中差异反映今昔巨变

    首都两度确定十大建筑  其中差异反映今昔巨变
    建国四十年来北京曾两次评选“十大建筑”。
    第一次是一九五九年。被评上的“十大建筑”是：人民大会堂、历史博物馆、军事博物馆、全国农业展览馆、民族文化宫、民族饭店、工人体育场、北京火车站、华侨大厦和钓鱼台迎宾馆。
    第二次是一九八八年，被评上的“八十年代十大建筑”是：北京图书馆新馆、中国国际展览中心、中央彩电中心、首都机场候机楼、国际饭店、大观园、长城饭店、中国剧院、中国人民抗日战争纪念馆和东四十条地铁站。
    五十年代和八十年代，两次评选“十大建筑”，其实有很大的不同，说来很有点意思——
    五十年代著名的十大建筑严格地说，不是评选出来的。因为当时迎接建国十周年建成的只有这十大工程。而八十年代的“十大建筑”是
  “评”了又“评”的。这些年，北京一年就竣工各类房屋建筑一千万平方米，造型新颖、各异其彩的精美建筑比比皆是，从这么多的新建筑中评选出十大建筑，还真不好评呢。最后只好来个“少数服从多数”，由几十万北京人投票选举定夺。
    五十年代，北京建设国庆十大工程，用的是大会战的方式，是在全国人民的支援下建成的。八十年代，北京的很多新建筑几乎是“悄悄”地出现在首都街头。建国四十年后的今天，建设几座大厦已经不必举国支援了。
    还有一个本质的不同，五十年代，十大工程都是解决各方面急需的项目，是“雪中送炭”。就说人民大会堂吧，当时中央人民政府连一个开人民代表会议的地方都没有。再说北京火车站，如果不建设，北京就会进不来出不去……而八十年代十大建筑，则可以说是进一步给咱共和国首都“锦上添花”的项目，大多添的是中国对外开放之“花”。
