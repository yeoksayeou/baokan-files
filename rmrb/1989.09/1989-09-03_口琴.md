When I was in the third grade of elementary school, that autumn, American planes were constantly circling over the Liaodong Peninsula. The propaganda of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Defending the Motherland" became the overriding task. To solve the problem of purchasing instruments for the school's performance team, all teachers and students went to South Dasha Mountain to cut goatbeard grass for three days. I was known as the school's notorious troublemaker, cutting little grass but singing enthusiastically. I remember one afternoon, the sky was gray, and the northwest wind was blowing so hard that I was shivering. To forget the cold, I climbed onto a crooked tree and hummed the Northeast folk song "Lost Ring." I slipped off the tree and screamed in fright. But I didn't fall to the rocks below; instead, I was caught by a teacher in his twenties, who was quite handsome.

I looked up and saw that it was a new teacher. My heart pounded with fear; I was sure I was going to get a scolding. But to my surprise, he didn't scold me. Instead, he praised me, "Little rascal, you've got a good voice! How about joining the performance team?" Hearing this, I turned from fear to joy and eagerly agreed. This young teacher was my lifelong unforgettable mentor, An Xiang.

An Xiang was enthusiastic and talented, skilled in playing drums, guitars, flutes, and pipes. He was particularly good at playing the harmonica and the dizi flute. He could also compose quick-talk and lotus-fall performances without missing a beat. He took a special liking to me and always wanted me to perform the programs he had prepared. In the span of two to three years, I not only participated in performances of popular plays in the early days of liberation in southern Liaoning, such as "Liu Hulan" and "Mutual Aid," but also performed in plays like "Women's Representative" and "Liu Lianying." Under An Xiang's guidance, I even started to create and perform my own acts. My literary journey began at that time.

Our performance team became increasingly famous, and we little actors became local celebrities. My head started to swell with pride. Sometimes, I even became arrogant and haughty to the point of being overbearing. I remember during a performance in Waidun Village, because the makeup artist, Dai Lan, didn't draw beautiful eyebrows for me, I pounded the table furiously, knocking An Xiang's harmonica off the table and onto the iron stove, chipping off a piece. I was so scared that I didn't dare go to school for two days. I worked on the railway as a laborer, earning three yuan and sixty cents, and secretly bought a new harmonica in Xiongyue City to make amends. But he refused to accept it, telling me to keep it for myself, saying he would teach me how to play the harmonica in the future.

Two days later, while I was at home cooking millet porridge for my mother, who had just given birth to my little sister, An Xiang came with a basket of red-skinned eggs to visit my mother. He spoke kindly to my mother, "Auntie, you are weak. The child worked hard to earn a few yuan, which should be used to buy you some nourishing food. How could he spend it on a harmonica for me? But we need to work together to correct his arrogance. A good seedling, if not properly tended, will not grow into a fine tree..."

I was washing apples for the teacher in the main hall and heard his words. Tears welled up in my eyes like a tidal wave. I rushed into the inner room and hugged An Xiang, "Teacher! I will go and apologize to Dai Lan tomorrow."

In just three short years, I not only learned to play the harmonica from An Xiang but also learned to read sheet music and compose quick-talk. My arrogance improved a lot, and before graduating from elementary school, I joined the Communist Youth League and was repeatedly named a model student. Under An Xiang's influence, I also learned to care for the collective and my classmates. I remember one snowy winter day, I accompanied An Xiang through a foot of deep snow to escort Jiang Shan, a young girl living in Dongbei Gorge, back home. Unfortunately, we encountered a hungry wolf. He fearlessly rushed forward, using the dizi flute he carried to fight the wolf and rescue little Jiang Shan from its jaws. This girl later became a pillar of the southern Liaoning drama troupe. I also remember in July 1953, during a big flood, An Xiang led me and a dozen children back from a performance at the Silica Mine. The rolling waves of the floating river blocked our way. It was An Xiang who lifted everyone over his head, safely delivering them to the other side. I was the last one he carried. I was holding his clothes, and accidentally dropped his harmonica into the water. My heart raced like a cat's claws, and I dove in to retrieve the harmonica without a second thought. An Xiang saw the situation and immediately grabbed me. Our heads appeared and disappeared in the water, and the classmates on the shore stomped their feet and cried, panicking. Finally, I held the harmonica in my hand, and An Xiang carried me, both of us drenched, back to the shore. An Xiang limped as he walked, with a long deep cut on his calf, bleeding all the way to his heel. It turned out he had been cut by a hard wooden stake...

Blink of an eye, 35 years have passed. The things I bought as a child are all gone, but the harmonica I bought with the money I earned as a laborer for An Xiang is still with me. The four characters "Teacher and Student Souvenir" carved by An Xiang on the back of the harmonica are still visible. Whenever I see this harmonica, I think of An Xiang, his chipped harmonica, and whether I still have any traces of arrogance...

Last autumn, I finally returned to my hometown in Xiongyue City, southern Liaoning, to visit An Xiang, whom I had longed to see for so long. An Xiang was already an elderly man with a shuffling gait, but his spirit was still as vibrant as ever. With his familiar, intelligent, and warm eyes, and the gold tooth he had after losing a tooth while fighting the wolf, I immediately rushed over and hugged his shoulders tightly. Our tears soaked through each other's clothes. I took out an Austrian harmonica I had specially bought for him abroad recently and placed it in front of him. This time, he happily accepted my gift, saying, "Excellent! The provincial radio station is also going to record a CD of Northeast folk songs for the 40th anniversary of liberation, and this harmonica will come in handy." As we spoke, I took out the harmonica that had been with me for nearly forty years and played "Revolutionaries Are Forever Young" with An Xiang. The teachers present joined in singing, and everyone's eyes welled up with tears. In the tearful blur, I seemed to see An Xiang carrying me over the river, his leg bleeding, and I heard his constant reminder to me not to be arrogant at any time...

    口琴
    郑恩波
    我上小学三年级的那年秋天，美国飞机整天在辽东半岛上空盘旋。宣传“抗美援朝、保家卫国”，成了压倒一切的任务。为了解决学校演出队购买乐器的费用问题，全校师生到南大山割了三天羊胡子草。我是全校有名的淘气鬼，草割的不多，歌儿倒唱得挺欢。记得一天下午，天色灰蒙蒙的，小西北风吹得我直打牙帮子。为了忘记寒冷，我骑在一棵歪脖树上，哼起东北民歌《丢戒指》，一不当心，从树上滑了下去，吓得大叫起来。可我并没掉到石砬子下边去，被一个二十岁左右、长得眉清目秀的老师接在怀里了。
    我一看，这是位新老师，心里很害怕；一准要挨顿尅了。”没想到，他非但没批评我，反而以赏识的口气问我：
  “小嘎儿，嗓子不赖呀！参加演出队怎么样？”闻听此话我转惊为喜，满口答应。这位年轻的老师，就是我终生难以忘怀的安祥。
    安祥老师热情豪爽，多才多艺，鼓号琴瑟，笙管笛箫，无所不会。口琴和洞箫吹得尤其好。编起快板、莲花落来，保险不错一句辙口。他特别厚爱我，编好的节目总愿意叫我表演。在两三年的时间里，我不仅参加演出了解放初期在辽南十分流行的《刘胡兰》、
  《互助》等歌剧，《妇女代表》、《刘莲英》等话剧，而且在安祥老师的启发、诱导下，还自编自演起节目来。我的文学之步，就是从这时候开始迈出的。
    我们的演出队名气愈来愈大，我们这些小演员也就成了本乡本县的“明星”，于是，我的脑袋开始发热了。有时甚至骄傲、狂妄到盛气凌人的程度。记得是在腰屯村演出那一次，因为管化妆的黛兰同学没给我画俊眉眼，我便抡拳猛敲桌子，将安祥老师搁在桌边上的石人望牌口琴，震到桌旁的铁炉子上，摔掉了一块碴儿，吓得我两天没敢到校。跑到铁路上当小工，挣了三元六角钱，偷偷到熊岳城买了一把新的石人望牌口琴，想送给安祥老师，以此补过。可是，他怎么也不肯收，要我自己留着，说以后还要教我学吹口琴。
    过了两天，正当我在家里给刚刚生下小妹妹的妈妈熬小米粥时，安祥老师?着一柳条筐红皮鸡蛋看望妈妈来了。他和颜悦色地对妈妈说：“二婶，您身体弱，孩子当小工好不容易挣了几元钱，应该给您买点营养品，怎能给我买口琴呢？不过对他自大这个缺点，咱们得一起想点办法，好苗管不好也成不了材……”
    正在堂屋地里给老师洗苹果的我，听到老师的话，泪水顿时像潮水似的涌流出来，冲进里屋抱住安祥老师：“老师！我明天就去找黛兰同学道歉。”
    就这样，在短短的三年时间里，我不仅跟安祥老师学会了吹口琴，还学会了识乐谱，编快板，自大的毛病也改了许多，小学毕业前就入了团，多次被评为模范学生。在安祥老师的影响下，我也学会了关心集体和同学。记得一个大雪扬扬的冬日，我陪安祥老师踏着一尺深的厚雪，护送居住在东北沟里的姜珊小同学回家。不巧遇上一只饿狼，他奋不顾身地冲上去，用带在身上的洞箫与狼厮打，从狼口里抢出了姜珊小姑娘。这位女同学后来成了辽南戏剧团的台柱子。还记得1953年7月发大水，有一天安祥老师领着我和十几个孩子到硅石矿演出回来，波涛滚滚的浮渡河挡住了我们的去路。是安祥老师把大家一个个举过头顶，安全地送到彼岸。他最后一次举在头顶的是我。我手里抱着他的衣裤，没小心，把他放在裤兜里的口琴掉在水里了。我心里急得像猫爪抓，一个猛子扎下去，为找口琴不要命了。安祥老师一见大势不好，立刻又去抓我。两个人的头在水流里时隐时现，聚在岸上的同学跺脚哭喊，慌成一团。最后，我手里握着口琴，安祥老师怀里抱着我，落汤鸡似的上了岸。安老师一拐一瘸地走路，小腿肚上有一条长长的深口子，血一直流到脚后跟，原来是被一个硬木橛子划伤了……
    弹指一挥间，过去了35年。小时候买的东西都不见了，唯独当年用当小工挣的钱为安祥老师买的这把口琴，却一直伴随在我的身边。口琴后背上，安祥老师特意刻下的
  “师生留念”四个小字，至今依然可见。一看见这把口琴，我就要想起安祥老师，想起他的那把掉了碴儿的石人望牌口琴，想想自己身上是否还有骄傲的缺点……
    去年金秋，我终于回到故乡辽南熊岳城，看望了思念已久的安祥老师。安老师已是步履蹒跚的老人了，但精神还是那么矍铄。凭他那熟悉的、聪慧的、热情的眼神，凭他当年与饿狼厮打掉牙后镶的那颗门牙，我立刻扑了上去，紧紧地抱住了他的双肩。我们的泪水湿透了彼此的衣襟。我把不久前在国外特意为他买的一把奥地利口琴从书包里取出来，放到他的面前。这一回，他高兴地收下了我的礼物，连声说：“好极了！最近省电台还要给我录制一盘解放四十年东北民歌大联唱，这把口琴正用得上。”说话间，我又从兜里掏出那把跟随了我近四十年的石人望牌口琴，与安祥老师一起合奏起《革命人永远是年轻》。在座的老师一起跟着唱起来，人人眼里都迸出了泪花。泪影中，我仿佛又看到了那位举着我过河、腿上淌着鲜血的安祥老师，想起了我们一起演出《刘胡兰》、《互助》的情景，听到了他对我任何时候都不要骄傲的嘱咐……
