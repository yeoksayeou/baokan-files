To solemnly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Bank of China will issue a set of gold and silver commemorative coins starting September 28th this year. The set consists of four coins.

Among these commemorative coins, there is one large 20-ounce pure gold coin. The obverse features the national emblem and the theme of national unity. The reverse depicts the scene of Chairman Mao Zedong announcing the founding of the People's Republic of China from Tiananmen Gate on October 1, 1949, during the grand opening ceremony. The other three coins include one 1/4-ounce gold coin and two 27-gram silver coins. The obverse of each features the national emblem and peony flowers, while the reverse features images symbolizing the prosperity and happiness of socialist China and the people's lives: "Double Crane Auspicious Image," "Soaring Dove Peace Image," and "Eagle in Flight Image."

This set of 40th anniversary commemorative coins is meticulously minted by the China Mint and is exclusively distributed by the China Gold Coin Corporation. The overseas agent is the Hong Kong China Coin Company Limited.

The People's Bank of China will also issue one copper-nickel commemorative coin with a face value of one yuan, which will be equivalent to the current circulation of the Renminbi and will be issued in limited quantities nationwide. The Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, issued a notice on September 25th regarding this matter (full text to be published separately).
