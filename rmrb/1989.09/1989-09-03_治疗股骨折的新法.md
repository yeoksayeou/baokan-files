Moscow Orthopedic Center has developed a new surgical method for treating severe femur fractures. This method significantly shortens the recovery time.

Typically, patients with femur fractures need to stay in bed for at least two months. However, with the new surgical method, patients can sit up in bed with their legs hanging down the next day, stand without a cane by the seventh day, and be discharged from the hospital after three weeks. A. Imamaliev, the head of the Orthopedic Center, said: "The essence of the new method is that we do not open the fracture site but instead insert a metal pin through a 1.5-centimeter hole above the knee joint into the broken bone. The surgery is minor, avoiding significant bodily trauma and deformity. This is the main advantage of the new method. Additionally, the patient can move around. Although the pin goes through the knee joint, it can almost immediately start functioning from the first hour after surgery. This is very important."

The new method has been tested on 200 patients. The center is working to specialize in treating this condition. There are no age restrictions for the new method, with patients ranging from 16 to 94 years old.

    治疗股骨折的新法
    莫斯科矫形中心研究出一种治疗严重股骨骨折的新的外科方法。这种方法能大大缩短痊愈时间。
    通常，股骨折病人至少要在床上躺两个月。而用新方法作手术，病人第二天就能在床上垂着腿坐着，第七天可不用拐杖站着，3个星期后可出院。矫形中心负责人A·伊马马利耶夫说：“新方法的实质在于，我们不打开骨折处，而是把一个金属销通过膝关节上一个1.5厘米的小孔导入折断的骨头内。外科手术小，可避免身体的创伤畸变。这是新方法的主要优点。此外，病人可以活动。膝关节虽然穿入了销，但几乎从手术后第一个小时起就能工作。这点非常重要”。
    新方法已在200名患者身上作了试验。该中心正在使对这种病治疗专业化。对新方法来说，没有年龄限制，在患者中间有从16岁到94岁不同年龄的病人。　·边杰·
