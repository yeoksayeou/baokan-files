In early June, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway was disrupted multiple times due to the counter-revolutionary riots, causing the 145/146 train traveling between Nanchang and Beijing to be stranded for 62 hours. The train faced threats of water, food, and coal shortages...

The air inside the carriages was stifling and hot. Over a thousand passengers were parched and hungry. Train Manager Luo Laiping mobilized the 40-plus train staff: "Act quickly, find water, find rice, find vegetables, and provide good service. We must not let the passengers be alarmed."

Near the Tingxi Bridge, there was a small well used by workers. Luo Laiping gathered all the containers that could hold water from the train and placed them by the well. One ladle at a time, they drew water, forming a long line from the well to the train. Under the scorching sun, they toiled for over five hours to fill five water boilers. Unable to buy coal, they borrowed some from a nearby freight car. Meanwhile, they dispatched train staff to climb mountains and fetch rice and vegetables from nearby villages. When the passengers finally held a cup of hot tea and ate a hot meal, the train's dozens of staff had only had two bowls of porridge that day.

In times of hardship, true feelings are revealed, and this is also a testament to their unwavering commitment to providing quality service. This train has eight teams, and it is often overcrowded by more than 80%. The work is very hard and tiring. However, over the years, this team has had no disciplinary issues and has been named a "Civilized Train" by the Ministry of Railways multiple times.

During a period when negative social influences were prevalent, some trains adopted a mindset of "money first," stopping the supply of free hot water and selling expensive bottled drinks; some train staff sold cigarettes; and the prices of meals in the dining car kept rising. However, on this train, the supply of free hot water was never interrupted. A boxed meal included sausages, meat strips, and cabbage, costing only 2 yuan, made from ingredients bought at negotiated prices. Someone suggested they could charge more, but the dining car manager said, "Passengers are not easy when they travel. If we charge too much, they can't afford it."

Running to Beijing, train staff have a sense of honor; quality service makes the carriage a place of civilization. With righteousness rising, evil winds naturally subside. Some passengers carried contraband cigarettes, and others brought pornographic magazines on board to sell. Train staff immediately stopped them when they discovered these activities. Once, the fourth team's train manager, Chen Xuanfang, was severely injured by a few thugs and hospitalized for two months. He said, "It's okay if I get injured, but we must not let evil winds infiltrate our civilized carriage." A train staff member fell seriously ill, and the entire team immediately raised over 1,000 yuan to help with his family expenses and purchase nutritional items. This spirit of unity and friendship made everyone's efforts naturally come together.

    情满车厢
    赵相如　罗慧敏
    六月初，京广线受反革命暴乱影响，多次中断运行。一次，行进在南昌至北京间的145／146次列车被堵在半路，时间长达六十二小时。列车面临断水、断粮、断煤威胁……
    车厢里空气混浊、闷热。上千名旅客干渴难耐，饥肠辘辘。列车长罗来平，向四十多名列车员发出动员令：“迅速行动起来，找水，找米，找菜，搞好服务，千万不能让旅客受惊。”
    汀泗桥附近只有个可供工人用的小水井，罗来平把车上能装水的桶子集中起来，放在井边，一勺一勺地舀水，从井边到列车组成了一条接水长龙，骄阳下苦战五个多钟头，才把五个茶水炉加满水。实在买不到煤，他们就向附近停着的一辆货车上借了一些。与此同时，他们派出列车员，翻山越岭从附近的山村里背回了米菜。当旅客终于捧起茶缸泡上一杯香茶，吃上热饭菜的时候，列车上几十名工作人员一天只喝了两次稀饭。
    难危时刻见真情，也是他们坚持不懈开展优质服务活动的集中体现。这趟列车有八个车组，车上经常超员百分之八十以上，工作十分辛苦劳累。但是，多年来这个集体没有一个违纪的，多次被铁道部命名为“文明列车”。
    前个时期，在社会不良风气盛行的时候，有的列车“向钱看”思想泛滥，白开水不供应了，卖起昂贵的罐装饮料；有的列车员倒卖香烟；餐车饭菜价格一个劲涨。但是，在这次列车上白开水一直没有中断供应。一盒饭有红肠、肉丝、白菜等，只收二元钱，是议价买进的料。有人劝他们卖价可以高一些，餐车主任说：“旅客出门在外不容易，卖得太贵，他们承受不了。”
    跑北京，列车员有一种荣誉感；优质服务，使车厢文明蔚成风气。正气上升，歪风邪气自然下降。有的旅客违法携带走私香烟，还有人把黄色书刊背上车卖。列车员一经发现，便当场制止。有一次，四组列车长陈宣方被几个歹徒打成重伤，住院两个月。他说：“我受点伤不要紧，关键是不能让歪风邪气侵蚀我们的文明车厢。”有个列车员得了重病，全车班的同志一下子就凑了一千多元，让他贴补家用和购买营养物品。这种团结友爱的精神，使大伙的劲都自觉地拧在一起了。
