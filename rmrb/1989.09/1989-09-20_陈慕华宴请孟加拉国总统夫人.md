Chen Mu Hua, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the All-China Women's Federation, hosted a dinner in Beijing today to welcome Roshan Ershad, wife of the President of Bangladesh, and her entourage.

In her speech at the dinner, Chen Mu Hua highly praised the deep traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Bangladesh. She said, "There is a Chinese proverb: 'The true strength of a horse is known over a long journey, and the sincerity of a person is shown over time.' Many facts have proven that the friendship between the peoples of China and Bangladesh is sincere and can withstand the test of time."

Chen Mu Hua said that in recent years, under the leadership of President Ershad, Bangladesh has made commendable achievements in maintaining national independence, developing the national economy, and improving the living standards of the people. Bangladesh is also playing an active role in international affairs.

Roshan Ershad, in her speech, discussed the issue of women's status. She said that in many aspects, China has set an example for gender equality, even surpassing many Western countries. Bangladesh also attaches great importance to ensuring that women fully participate in national development. The Bangladeshi government has taken many measures to improve the status of women.

She hoped that the women's organizations of the two countries could make some institutional arrangements and, through mutual visits and exchanges of their activities, maintain regular contact.

Roshan and her entourage arrived in Beijing today at the invitation of the Chinese government.
