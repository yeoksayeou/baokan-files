In 1973, the U.S. military was forced to withdraw from South Vietnam. Especially after Vietnam's national liberation in 1975, the Vietnamese authorities have been keen on regional hegemony, viewing China as their main obstacle, and becoming increasingly unfriendly towards China. They have even publicly occupied Chinese territory, repeatedly provoking border conflicts with China, and cruelly persecuting and expelling a large number of Vietnamese Chinese. China, in order to maintain friendly relations between the peoples of China and Vietnam, has repeatedly reminded the Vietnamese authorities not to do things that would cause pain to friends and pleasure to enemies. However, the Vietnamese authorities have persisted, going further and further down the path of anti-China actions.

On December 25, 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia. China strongly condemned and opposed Vietnam's serious violation of the United Nations Charter and international law principles, firmly supporting the Cambodian people's war of resistance against Vietnam and for national salvation. China has been tirelessly fighting for a just and reasonable solution to the Cambodian problem. The Vietnamese authorities, however, closely linked their invasion of Cambodia with their anti-China stance. In the summer of 1978, the Vietnamese authorities labeled China as the "most direct and dangerous enemy," threatening to "strike and attack within and outside the border." For this reason, Vietnam amassed a large number of armed forces along the Sino-Vietnamese border, repeatedly violating Chinese territory, destroying Chinese villages, looting Chinese property, and killing Chinese military personnel and civilians.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry made strong protests on January 18, February 10, and February 16, 1979, demanding that the Vietnamese authorities immediately stop all provocative activities. However, the Vietnamese authorities ignored these protests.

In an unbearable situation, the Chinese border forces were forced to retaliate on February 17, 1979, eliminating most of the Vietnamese public security outposts along the Sino-Vietnamese border that had been specifically harassing and destroying China. They also destroyed various military facilities in the border area used by Vietnam to invade China.

On March 16, the Chinese border forces withdrew entirely back into Chinese territory.

    反击越南反华行径
    1973年美军被迫从南越撤走，特别是1975年越南全国解放后，越南当局热衷于地区霸权主义，视中国为其主要障碍，对中国越来越不友好，甚至公开侵占中国领土，不断挑起中越边境冲突，残酷迫害和大量驱赶越南华侨。中国从维护中越两国人民友好关系的大局出发，一再提醒越南当局不要做使亲者痛，仇者快的事情。但越南当局却一意孤行，在反华的道路上越走越远。
    1978年12月25日，越南对柬埔寨发动了全面的侵略战争。中国强烈谴责和反对越南严重违反联合国宪章和国际法准则的侵略行径，坚决支持柬埔寨人民的抗越救国战争，为公正合理地解决柬埔寨问题进行了不懈的斗争。越南当局则把侵柬同反华密切地联系在一起，1978年夏，越南当局称中国为“最直接、最危险的敌人”，扬言要“在边界以内和边界以外进行反击和进攻”。为此，越南沿中越边境集结了大量武装部队，一再侵犯中国领土，摧毁中国村寨，抢劫中国财产，杀害中国军民。
    中国外交部在1979年1月18日、2月10日和2月16日，连续3次提出强烈抗议，要求越南当局立即停止一切挑衅活动，但越南当局置若罔闻。
    在忍无可忍的情况下，中国边防部队于1979年2月17日被迫奋起还击，拔除了中越边境全线绝大部分专门对中国进行骚扰破坏的越军公安屯，摧毁了边境地区越南用以对中国进行侵略的各种军事设施。
    3月16日，中国边防部队奉命全部撤回中国境内。
