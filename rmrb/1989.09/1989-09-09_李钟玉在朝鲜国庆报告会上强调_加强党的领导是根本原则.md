    Li Jong-yul emphasized at the central report meeting held in Pyongyang to commemorate the 41st anniversary of North Korea's founding that strengthening the party's leadership is the fundamental principle for enhancing the functions and role of the people's power and developing the socialist political system in socialist construction. Only under the party's leadership can the people's power operate in accordance with the will of the masses and accomplish the socialist cause.

    The central report meeting was held this afternoon at the February 8 Cultural Hall in Pyongyang. North Korean party and government leaders O Jin-u, Li Jong-yul, Yun Hyong-muk, Kim Yong-nam, Kye Ung-tae, and Chu Ch'ang attended the meeting.

    In his speech at the meeting, Li Jong-yul reviewed the achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction over the past 41 years under the leadership of Chairman Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party.

    He said that the struggle between socialism and capitalism is a struggle between new things and old things. In this struggle, new things will inevitably triumph, and old things will inevitably perish. This is an irresistible law of historical development.

    Li Jong-yul pointed out that currently, imperialism, in defiance of the historical trend, is using various means and methods to try to obstruct the development of socialism and make it take the capitalist road. The imperialists' propaganda of "the eternal nature of capitalism" and the "end of communist belief" is merely a tactic they use to cover up the reactionary nature of the capitalist system and achieve their anti-socialist strategy.

    When discussing the issue of Korean reunification, Li Jong-yul said that resolving the Korean issue through dialogue and consultation is a unanimous demand of all Koreans. This fully conforms to the trend of the times. The North hopes to achieve national reunification through dialogue to establish the Democratic Confederation of Koryo.

    李钟玉在朝鲜国庆报告会上强调
    加强党的领导是根本原则
    新华社平壤9月9日电　（记者张锦芳）朝鲜国家副主席李钟玉今天在平壤举行的纪念朝鲜建国41周年中央报告大会上强调，在社会主义建设中加强党的领导是提高人民政权的职能和作用、发展社会主义政治制度所必须坚持的根本原则。只有在党的领导下，人民政权才能根据人民大众的意愿开展活动，完成社会主义事业。
    今天下午的中央报告大会在平壤二·八文化会馆举行。朝鲜党政领导人吴振宇、李钟玉、延亨默、金永南、桂应泰、许锬等出席了大会。
    李钟玉在大会上作报告时回顾了41年来朝鲜人民在金日成主席和劳动党的领导下在社会主义建设中取得的成就。
    他说，社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争是新事物同旧事物的斗争。在这场斗争中，新事物必然胜利，旧事物必然灭亡。这是不可抗拒的历史发展规律。
    李钟玉指出，当前，帝国主义违背历史的潮流以各种手段和方法试图阻止社会主义的发展，使之走资本主义道路。帝国主义者宣扬的“资本主义永恒”和共产主义“信念的终结”只不过是他们试图掩盖资本主义制度的反动本质，实现反社会主义战略的一种手法。
    李钟玉在谈到朝鲜统一问题时说，通过对话和协商和平解决朝鲜问题是全体朝鲜人民的一致要求。这完全符合当今时代的趋势。朝鲜北方希望通过对话以建立高丽民主联邦共和国的方式实现祖国统一。
