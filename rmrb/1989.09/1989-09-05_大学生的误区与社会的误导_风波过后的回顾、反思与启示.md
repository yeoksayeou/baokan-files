This was a heart-rending scene:

From mid-April to early June, over 80 cities, 600-plus colleges, and 2.8 million students participated in street protests across the country; the gate of New China, the symbol of national dignity, was repeatedly stormed; the vast and majestic Tiananmen Square was occupied by some students for over 20 days; almost all key universities saw students boycotting classes for extended periods; many campuses were plastered with big-character posters criticizing the Party and the government. Student self-governance committees broadcasted and spread rumors, issuing inflammatory statements;...

From a student movement to nationwide turmoil, culminating in a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. How many good-hearted people felt worried, shocked, and confused. Under the Party Central Committee's correct decision, after a fierce struggle of blood and fire, the plot by the instigators of the turmoil to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership, negate the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China was foiled, and China avoided a significant historical setback.

After the turmoil, while people felt relieved, they also fell into deep reflection. Why were so many young students drawn into the student movement and turmoil? Many university students also fell into a state of confusion from which they couldn't extricate themselves: "We are patriotic; we want to advance China's democratic process; we demand the punishment of 'official profiteering' and the eradication of corruption. Our starting point is good, so how did it lead to such severe consequences?"

The tragedy must not be repeated! Painfully reflecting, we need to face the reality that has occurred, engage in painful yet sincere introspection, and awaken to the future. Hotspots and Trajectories – A Fluctuating Curve

In 1978, a new era began for higher education in China. The first batch of university students after the Cultural Revolution, with their talents and knowledge, passed the national entrance examination and entered the halls of academia. As victors, their inner joy soothed the past losses, while they lamented the loss of time and the fleeting youth. The demand to "reclaim lost time" became a universal aspiration, and "achieving success" became a shared goal.

The significance of 1978 was not limited to education. That year saw the beginning of the discussion on the criterion of truth, and the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the end of the year. This marked a new turning point in China's history. University students resonated strongly with this, symbolizing their close integration with the political, economic, and cultural life of society. While they supported and rejoiced in this, it was accompanied by a movement of ideological liberation, engaging in painful and intense reflections and debates on many significant historical and contemporary social and political issues. They touched the wounds inflicted by the "Leftist" influence, expressing deep disgust for personal cults and the line of "class struggle as the key link," while also harboring doubts and suspicions about the "Four Cardinal Principles." In some students, a "crisis of trust" and a "crisis of faith" began to emerge.

At this time, bourgeois liberalization trends in society took advantage of the situation. The "election" frenzy that occurred in some universities in the fall and winter of 1980 can be seen as a reflection of these underlying ideological issues.

In the spring of 1980, the discussion about "Pan Xiao's letter" and the subsequent popularity of the "self-design, self-achievement" viewpoint, especially the introduction of Sartre's "existentialism" into Chinese university campuses, caused waves among university students. "Man" and "self" became hot topics among university students. What is the essence of man? What is the purpose of life? Is the essence of man selfish? Is the life credo of being subjective for oneself and objective for others correct? A series of questions led to painful contemplation and intense debates among university students. They had the feeling of "the path of life becoming narrower and narrower," but also the ambition of "self-design, self-striving, self-improvement, and self-realization." This was a collision between the individual and society, between value aspirations and objective reality. Undeniably, the consciousness of "self" was greatly strengthened in the minds of university students, becoming the main support of their worldview. Fortunately, in the early 1980s, students from Class 7 (2) of Tsinghua University first proposed the slogan "To realize the Four Modernizations, start with me, start now"; in 1982 and 1983, heroes like Zhang Hua and the Hua Shan rescue team emerged; during this period, some conscious university graduates volunteered to work in the grassroots, border areas, and remote mountainous regions...

This was like the red plums jumping over the wall in spring, indicating that a part of university students had stepped out of the "self" misconception, integrating "self" into the era and society. However, the "self" undercurrent, with the influx of Western trends and the societal guidance of "everything for money," continuously infiltrated more students' minds.

The rise of reform, the successive introduction of reform plans for the economic, educational, and scientific systems, made university students excited. They naturally saw themselves as reformers, showing unprecedented enthusiasm. They placed unlimited hopes and passion in reform, consciously or unconsciously linking their fate with reform. On March 20, 1984, when the Chinese men's volleyball team first won the "Asian Cup," Beijing University students were ecstatic, shouting the era-defining and historical slogan: "Unite and revitalize China." During the National Day parade in 1984, the Beijing University contingent, as they approached the reviewing stand at Tiananmen Square, suddenly unfurled a banner reading "Hello, Deng Xiaoping," which resonated both domestically and internationally. Linked with the influence of the new technological revolution worldwide, driven by the "reform fever," university students, identifying with reform, saw many of their behaviors affirmed by society, and their self-evaluation began to rise. They tried to quickly find ways and means to synchronize with reform and showcase their talents in the cause of revitalizing China. This led to the rapid rise of various "heats" among university students: "Party Constitution Study Group Heat," "Social Practice Heat," "Pursuit of New Knowledge Heat," "Emphasis on Ability Heat," and "Demand for Independence Heat." It can be said that this was the most emotionally intense and passionate period for university students in the past 10 years.

Entering 1985, political system reform was proposed, bourgeois liberalization trends fluctuated, and with the continuous strengthening of university students' self-awareness, their behavioral hotspots began to shift towards "participation heat," "political heat," "cultural heat," and "democracy heat." Some university students began to show anxiety and misunderstanding towards the contradictions, difficulties, and problems that emerged in the transition from old to new systems during reform. They had an eager mindset towards political system reform and were dissatisfied with the mistakes and problems caused by bureaucratism in scientific and technological introduction and foreign trade work. This dissatisfaction and the accumulation of energy from overly high expectations for reform finally led to the "9·18" student movement in 1985. Although the Party and the government affirmed students' patriotic enthusiasm while criticizing and negating their behavior of taking to the streets and posting big-character posters, this was not understood or accepted by more university students.

In 1986, when political system reform was hotly debated in society, university students were excited. Many of them attributed the various contradictions and problems reflected in economic system reform to the lag in political system reform, showing a keen interest in "political democracy" and "press freedom." At this time, bourgeois liberalization trends in society surged again, causing confusion in the minds of university students. Towards the end of the year and the beginning of the next, starting from Hefei and Shanghai, the 1986 student movement quickly spread to Beijing and many other cities. At this time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping once again called for "opposing bourgeois liberalization." From then on, society began to look at university students with suspicion, and newspapers simultaneously discussed the weaknesses of university students.

After 1987, many university students retreated into the solitude of their hearts. They felt that the government did not understand their patriotic enthusiasm and felt aggrieved. At the end of 1987, a university student named "Lang Lang" wrote a letter to the magazine "China Youth," loudly proclaiming, "What exactly is wrong with us?!" "Lang Lang" became a symbol for university students for a time. They fell into a double loss: political loss and loss of life value. The former manifested as coldness and loneliness towards society and politics, expressing "family affairs, national affairs, world affairs, none of my business." University students' cold attitude towards the "Two Basic Points" indeed reached its lowest point. Under the immense influence of bourgeois liberalization trends, university students' thoughts were extremely confused. Their vague understanding of the Party and the government, socialism, and reform increased, and their confidence gradually declined. Look at the survey data from relevant departments on the ideological state of university students in Beijing in June 1986 and June 1988: those who believed "relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, China has no hope of becoming rich and strong, advocating multi-party system" were 20.5% in 1986 and 21.1% in 1988; those who believed "socialism and capitalism have no superiority, advocating capitalism" were 16.8% in 1986 and 34.5% in 1988.

University students' loss of life value, on the one hand, expressed dissatisfaction and complaints about "inflation," "devaluation of knowledge," and "brain-body reversal." On the other hand, new trends of "uselessness of studying," "business fever," "dancing fever," "mahjong fever," and "love fever" flooded the campuses.

As a reflection of these two loss emotions, in 1988, two representative events occurred. In April, during the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, some universities posted big-character posters emphasizing "educational crisis," believing that "the situation of intellectuals is worsening." Over 10 postgraduate students from Peking University ran to Tiananmen Square to shine shoes for people's representatives, with the intention being quite obvious. In June, a student from Peking University was beaten to death by hooligans, triggering a small-scale student movement. Due to timely and decisive handling, it did not escalate into a larger-scale movement, but students' emotions were intense.

In the second half of 1988, the ideological and behavioral state of university students not only did not show obvious improvement but became more negative and cold. A survey by a key university in the capital at the end of 1988 showed that university students' disappointment with reform had risen to the top of various dissatisfactions. The trend of dropping out of school was still growing, and many students identified themselves as "Trot" (taking the "TOEFL" to go abroad) or "Mahjong faction."

University students are not willing to be idle; they will not end their thoughts and behaviors with negativity, coldness, and disappointment. Their past enthusiasm is only temporarily frozen; their desire to participate is just temporarily lacking an appropriate opportunity. Once it erupts, it will inevitably be more intense.

In 1988, the "He River Elegy Heat" and the "discussion heat" on the political system reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union quietly rolled among university students. By winter, some universities' political lectures, discussions, and "democracy salons" began to become active. Some prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization ran to universities to give speeches, advocating "political pluralism" and "economic privatization." At the same time, "new authoritarianism" also became a fresh topic in universities. This led to a rise in students' blind political emotions.

Facing the ideological state of students, people were anxious. The accumulation of students' cold and disappointed emotions and the convergence of centrifugal tendencies made people worry about which breaking point would trigger an uncontrollable student movement. For different purposes, everyone's attention was focused on "May 4th." As the Party, government, educational departments, and Communist Youth League organizations, they tried to use the 70th anniversary of "May 4th" to guide young students' emotions through normal channels to the themes of "patriotism, progress, reform, and entrepreneurship." Those with ulterior motives wanted to use young students' emotions and naivety to launch a large-scale student movement under the cover of "May 4th."

This was both a historical coincidence and a necessary development of things. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, this turmoil was bound to come, determined by the international climate and the domestic climate. Some people took advantage of Comrade Hu Yaobang's death to create the largest, longest, and most intense student movement in terms of participation, content, and form since the founding of the country, which eventually evolved into a nationwide turmoil and culminated in a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Even many students, after a moment of frenzy, felt bewildered. Despite this, many students still defended their good intentions and felt aggrieved and dissatisfied with the criticism from society. It is worth pondering that after several student movements, many students did not awaken or become alert but instead, the movements became more intense. Were the student movements truly, as some people advocated, representative of the direction of historical development? Were they naturally reasonable? Shouldn't there be a profound and realistic self-analysis of themselves?!

Subjective Aspirations and Personal Qualities – A State of Separation or Misalignment

The ten-year turmoil trampled on knowledge and destroyed talents, causing a gap in talent. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, respecting knowledge and talents became a new social fashion. Contemporary university students, as the elite and lucky ones among the youth, were born at the right time and were praised as "the darlings of heaven" and "the darlings of the times." The achievements of reform and opening up inspired them, and society's positive evaluation of university students, along with some people's deliberate flattery, especially the idea that "intellectuals should become the leading force in society" gradually becoming a trend, greatly strengthened university students' sense of superiority and subjectivity. This was prominently reflected in their several subjective consciousnesses different from ordinary youth, such as elite consciousness, transcendence consciousness, and participation consciousness, forming a unique cultural mentality among university students.

Elite consciousness. After going through repeated academic competitions and struggles, entering university, university students were proud of the shining school badges on their chests, as if they had become "high-class citizens" of the republic. In the campus or public places, who were "Beida people," "Tsinghua people," "Nankai people," everyone thought they were the cream of the crop. In a country with nearly 250 million illiterates and semi-illiterates, where only 13 out of every 10,000 are university students, university students were undoubtedly treasures. Especially as people increasingly felt that the competition in the future century would be a competition of talents, university students, as the reserve force of talents, naturally attracted envious glances. All these subtly made university students produce a sense of superiority, fostering a sense of arrogance, as if reform, construction, and the eradication of evil were all about them. Some students bluntly said that in 10 years, they would be ministers and governors, and even the position of premier was within reach. It was this elite consciousness that placed themselves in an inappropriate position, not within society but above it, resulting in a direction opposite to social reality and the demands of the people.

Transcendence consciousness. Contemporary university students are active in thought, strong in critical consciousness, and eager for innovation. They are not satisfied with and unwilling to accept ready-made conclusions, showing natural antipathy towards traditional things. When they opened the door to China and saw that China lagged far behind developed countries, when they saw that the Party and the government still made some mistakes in their work, when bureaucratism and corruption spread and various ugly phenomena in society resurfaced, university students showed unique sensitivity and dissatisfaction. They had a strong transcendence consciousness, from which they showed great interest in Western "democracy," "freedom," and "separation of powers"; they highly appreciated Western developed material civilization and the economic takeoff of the "Four Asian Tigers"; they applauded "He River Elegy" and showed disgust towards Chinese traditional culture. They could not bear to see the backwardness and ugliness in society and wanted to eliminate them overnight; they wanted China to become a developed country overnight. They could not tolerate reality and wanted to transcend it. However, they did not understand China's national conditions and forgot that any transcendence could only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to the socialist path. They deviated from the fundamental principle of starting from reality and taking reality as the starting point. Therefore, they often "lay in bed looking at the ceiling and designing China's reform blueprint," inevitably producing absurd and far-fetched fantasies like "pulling up the seedlings to help them grow," and sometimes their actions were as ridiculous as trying to leave the earth by pulling their own hair. Only a few university students were willing to admit this.

Participation consciousness. Linked with elite consciousness and transcendence consciousness, university students also had a strong participation consciousness. They were not satisfied with commenting on current politics but always wanted to show themselves in practice. In their minds, the development of society, the prosperity of the nation, the success of reform, and the eradication of evil could not be achieved without the participation of university students. They wanted to awaken the so-called "numbness" of the masses through their shouting; they wanted to ignite the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" through their enthusiasm; they wanted to advance the imagined process of China's reform through their calls. Therefore, they showed disgust towards those who still saw university students as "children" and expressed resentment towards those who advised them to focus their main energy on studying. They were like ships fully rigged, ready to sail into the sea without even weighing anchor; they were like arrows fully drawn, ready to shoot without even aiming. From this, it can be seen that their enthusiasm inevitably contained impatience, and their participation inevitably mixed with recklessness.

It is worth seriously summarizing and reflecting on the fact that the elite consciousness, transcendence consciousness, and participation consciousness among university students made them self-righteous, often criticizing the mistakes of society and others while avoiding their own shortcomings. It was precisely the gap between their subjective aspirations and personal qualities that made the effects of their actions far from their subjective motivations, even diverging.

Objectively analyzing and comparing university students' subjective consciousness and personal qualities, we might touch upon and grasp where some of the problems with university students lie. They hated the corrupt phenomena among some officials but generalized from one to all, thus doubting and wavering about the Four Cardinal Principles. They were full of enthusiasm for reform but did not understand the national conditions, had overly high expectations for reform, and lacked the ability to endure the difficulties and contradictions encountered in reform. They showed interest in various trends of thought at home and abroad but knew little about the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, showing prejudice and coldness towards Marxism-Leninism, even considering it outdated.

They took a contemptuous attitude towards national culture and showed a "starving man's" interest in Western thought and culture, leading some students to regard bourgeois philosophy as a classic, and historical idealism unknowingly became their method of observing problems. They demanded democracy but did not understand what democracy was, often using Western bourgeois democracy as a reference system, separating democracy from the rule of law, and even adopting anti-democratic methods in the process of demanding democracy.

They emphasized individual subjectivity but separated the individual from the collective and society, taking "self" as the pivot of life.

They appreciated the competitive consciousness, time-effectiveness, and efficiency consciousness associated with commodity economy but also harbored narrow utilitarianism, money worship, and pragmatism.

They demanded participation, but their enthusiasm and demands for participation were far from their ability and guiding ideology, sometimes inevitably becoming a fervor of anarchism. It can be seen that the serious shortcomings in university students' personal qualities led to a strong contrast with their subjective aspirations, and bourgeois liberalization trends inevitably took advantage of the situation. The fact is that last year, university students had already generally developed a mentality of "following their feelings," so they encountered problems whenever there was a storm. In this student movement and turmoil, many students went from following their feelings to following their emotions, eventually getting trapped in the turmoil and unable to extricate themselves.

Education and Guidance – Lack of a Clear Main Melody

After the turmoil, reflecting on the pain, it was not accidental that so many students were drawn into the student movement and turmoil. The fundamental reason was the long-term weakening of ideological and political work, the relaxation of Marxist education, and the relaxation of political requirements for students, leading to the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous thoughts among students.

We might as well review some of the domestic micro-climate issues and some erroneous guidance towards young students in society in recent years, including some prominent problems in students' political guidance, ideological and cultural guidance, social value guidance, and news and public opinion guidance, to deeply reflect and draw some beneficial enlightenment.

Political guidance: This was prominently reflected in the fundamental issue of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, which was not clear and confident, often only used as a "standard language" in documents, even seen as "clichés" and "empty talk." Comrade Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary of the Party, even said that the socialist road was unclear to anyone now. This not only emboldened those who advocated bourgeois liberalization but also caused great confusion in people's minds. In the ideological and theoretical circles, various theories such as "premature socialism," "failed socialism," "convergence of socialism and capitalism," "outdated Marxism," and "diminished Party leadership" were prevalent. In addition, for a long time, there was little emphasis on class analysis methods and class struggle, only emphasizing tolerance and relaxation. As peace and development gradually became the theme of the world today, people paid more attention to domestic peace and production and life, while less attention was paid to the analysis and exposure of the despicable intentions of international capitalism in carrying out "peaceful evolution" against us. All these weakened people's class consciousness. It is particularly worth noting that the prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization, with the protection and indulgence of Comrade Zhao Ziyang, vigorously advocated political "pluralism" and "multi-party system," economic "privatization," and advocated "complete Westernization," causing extremely harmful influences and making many people indifferent, suspicious, or even wavering about the Four Cardinal Principles.

Ideological and cultural guidance: With the opening up, various bourgeois trends and theories from the West flooded into China, while we lacked serious and rigorous analysis and criticism, causing these things to quickly spread among university students, impacting the Marxist camp. On the contrary, our propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought was very weak, and often adopted a picky attitude, making Marxism lose its due luster in people's minds. According to a sample survey by the Beijing University Students' Ideological State Investigation Team, 22.7% of people believed that Marxism was just a science, equal to other sciences, and could not guide other sciences. In some schools, this view reached 53.1%. A certain institute's survey of postgraduates showed that 11.7% believed that "scientific and technological personnel did not need to master Marxism," and 24.9% believed that "a little knowledge was enough." On the contrary, in campuses, there were "Sartre fever," "Freud fever," "Nietzsche fever," and "He River Elegy fever." Books like "Self Theory," "Head Theory," "Entropy – A New Worldview," "The Virtues of Human Nature," "The Weaknesses of Human Nature," and "Ugly Chinese People" became popular among university students. This subtle influence made individualistic thoughts, idealist historical views, and national nihilism infiltrate students' minds.

Social value guidance: Value views are the core of worldviews. The social value views we advocate are collectivism, serving the people, spirit of dedication, and linking one's ideals, future, and fate with the future and fate of the country, nation, and people. This communist moral view and value view are in opposition to bourgeois moral views and value views, with the most fundamental opposition being between collectivism and individualism, and between social orientation and individual orientation. The basic characteristics of individualism and individual orientation are to take personal interests as the starting point and destination, with "I am everything." For a period, we rarely propagated collectivism, the spirit of dedication, and serving the people. On the contrary, some people even attacked the "Leifeng spirit" as a "Leftist" product. Even worse, under the banner of "updating concepts," they vigorously advocated the "pragmatic theory" of "everything for money," advocating to highlight "self" and "returning to humanity." This self-centered propaganda made some university students take "I am the purpose, I am everything," and "I admire myself the most" as life mottos. It was precisely this life view centered on "self" that became the ideological foundation of political anarchism and self-interested utilitarianism, with the result of only seeking to obtain and not to dedicate in terms of interests; in terms of interpersonal relationships, only seeking profit; in terms of the relationship between the individual and the country, placing oneself above the country and society.

News and public opinion guidance: In modern society, information transmission media tend to be mass and socialized. The guidance of news and public opinion directly influences the emotions and ideological direction of the masses. It is both an indicator of mass emotions and a catalyst for mass emotions. Good news and public opinion can form a healthy and upward-looking public opinion environment, producing a cohesive and upward force, while erroneous news and public opinion cause confusion in people's thoughts. Reviewing the guidance of news and public opinion in recent years, the formation of various "hotspots" among young students was closely related to the guidance of news and public opinion. For example, the result of the "Pan Xiao discussion" undoubtedly made some individualistic views theoretical and systematic. Newspapers' propaganda about "T-shaped talents," "pioneering talents," and "elite talents" made people's understanding of talents one-sided, producing a tendency to emphasize intelligence over morality. The formation of "Western philosophical trends heat," "political system reform heat," "comparison of Chinese and Western cultures heat," and "He River Elegy heat" among students was not unrelated to the hype of news and public opinion. As for the then confusing "Shenzhen incident," it was exaggerated by some newspapers, and some people took the opportunity to negate the ideological and political work of socialism, leading to extreme confusion in the field of ideological and political work and among the masses. Reflecting on the sudden escalation of this turmoil, it was undoubtedly related to the erroneous guidance of news and public opinion and the fanning of the flames, and this lesson was very profound. The Way Out and Path – The Four Cardinal Principles are the Foundation of Education

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out profoundly that the biggest mistake in the past ten years was education, and ideological and political work was weak. Reflecting on the problems exposed in this turmoil in our education, the most fundamental issue was the relaxation of the Four Cardinal Principles education for young students, the neglect of the cultivation and guidance of students' political direction, leading to many students being influenced by bourgeois liberalization and deviating in political direction. We must clearly recognize that today's young students are a century-spanning generation, and history will push them to the position of successors.

For the sake of the country, the nation, and the future of socialism, from schools to society to families, from ideological, theoretical, and ideological consciousness to education, news, and publishing, we should fully implement the Party's educational policy, take the Four Cardinal Principles as the foundation of education, penetrate it into every link of students' growth, and currently pay special attention to several aspects of education. That is, persistently conducting Marxist education; persistently conducting patriotism, self-reliance, and hard work education; persistently conducting socialist democracy and rule of law education; strengthening students' national conditions education and social practice education. With the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, China's youth generation is completely full of hope and achievements.

Today's university students will certainly wake up and mature from the positive and negative lessons, grow up with our great republic, and shoulder the great historical mission of building the 21st century.

    大学生的误区与社会的误导
    ——风波过后的回顾、反思与启示
    程元
    这是惊心动魄的一幕：
    从4月中下旬到6月上旬，全国有80多个城市，600多所高校、280万人次的青年学生上街游行；
    中华人民共和国的礼仪之门——新华门被多次冲击；
    雄伟壮阔的天安门广场被一些学生占据达20余天之久；
    全国几乎所有的重点院校学生长时间罢课；
    许多校园里把矛头指向党和政府的大小字报四处张贴，
  “学生自治会”的广播大肆鼓噪，散布谣言，发表攻击性的言论；……
    由学潮到全国性的动乱，发展到北京发生反革命暴乱。多少善良的人们感到忧虑、震惊、迷惑。在党中央的正确决策下，经过血与火的搏斗，粉碎了动乱制造者们企图推翻共产党的领导、否定社会主义制度、颠覆中华人民共和国的阴谋，中国避免了一次历史的大倒退。
    风波过后，人们在庆幸之余，不免陷入深沉的反思。为什么这么多的青年学生被卷入学潮和动乱？许多大学生也陷入了难以自拔的困惑：“我们是爱国的，我们是想推进中国的民主进程的，我们要求惩治‘官倒’、根除腐败，我们的出发点是好的，怎么会闹到如此严重的后果呢？”
    悲剧不能重演！痛定思痛，我们需要正视已发生的现实，需要痛苦而又诚实的反思，需要面向未来的觉醒。热点与轨迹——一条时起时伏的曲线
    1978年，开始了我国高等教育又一个新的纪年。“文化大革命”后第一批大学生以自己的才华和学识，经过国家严格的考试，登上了大学的殿堂。他们作为胜利者，内心的喜悦抚慰了以往的失落，同时痛惜时光的流失，青春年华的消逝，把“损失的时间夺回来”成为大家普遍的要求，“成才”成为大家共同的热点。
    1978年的意义不仅在于教育，这一年所开展的真理标准的讨论，年末党的十一届三中全会的召开，这是中国历史的一个新的转折点。大学生与之产生了强烈的共鸣，标志着大学生与社会的政治、经济、文化生活紧密相融。他们在拥护和欢欣的同时，伴随着一场思想解放运动，对许多重大的历史的、现实的社会政治问题进行着痛苦而又激烈的反思、辩论。他们抚摸着自己在“左”的影响下的伤痕，对个人迷信、“以阶级斗争为纲”等等表示深恶痛绝，同时也对“四项基本原则”产生了困惑和疑虑，在一些学生中萌发着“信任危机”和“信仰危机”。
    此时，社会上的资产阶级自由化思潮乘虚而入。1980年秋冬在一些高等学校发生的“竞选”风潮，可以说是这些潜在思想问题的反映。
    1980年春关于“潘晓”一封信的讨论，时隔不久关于“自我设计、自我成才”观点的流行，特别是萨特的“存在主义”进入中国大学的校园，在大学生中引起层层波澜。“人”和“自我”成为大学生议论的热门话题。什么是人的本质？什么是人生的目的？人的本质是不是自私的？主观为自己、客观为别人的人生信条对不对？一连串的问号引起大学生痛苦的思索和激烈争论。他们既有“人生道路越走越窄”的失落，也升起了“自我设计、自我奋斗、自我完善、自我实现”的“雄心”。这是个人与社会、价值愿望与客观现实的撞击。无可否认“自我”的意识在大学生的思想中被大大强化了，成为人生观的主要支点。可喜的是80年代初清华大学化七（2）班的同学首先提出了实现四化“要从我做起，从现在做起”的口号；1982年和1983年又先后涌现出张华、华山抢险英雄群体；这一时期一些有觉悟的大学毕业生志愿到基层、到边疆、到边远山区去工作……
    这犹如春天的红杏跃出墙头，表明一部分大学生走出“自我”的误区，把“自我”融入时代与社会之中。然而“自我”的潜流随着西方思潮的涌入和社会上“一切向钱看”的导向，不断侵入越来越多学生的头脑。
    改革的兴起，经济体制改革、教育体制改革、科技体制改革方案的先后出台，使大学生振奋不已。他们以天然的改革者自居，表现出从未有过的振奋。他们对改革寄予无限的希望与热情，自觉或不自觉地把自己的命运与改革联系在一起。1984年3月20日，当中国男排首捧“亚洲”杯时，北京大学的学生欢喜若狂，喊出了具有时代性、历史性的口号：“团结起来、振兴中华”。1984年国庆节，北京大学的国庆游行队伍在走近天安门检阅台时，突然展开“小平您好”的横幅，在国内外激起认同的反响。与世界范围内的新的技术革命的影响相联系，在“改革热”的推动下，大学生因与改革认同，诸多行为受到社会的肯定，自我评价开始升值。他们试图尽快寻找到与改革同步，在振兴中华的事业中一显身手的方式和途径。由此在大学生中迅速兴起的“党章学习小组热”、“社会实践热”、“追求新知热”、“注重能力热”、“要求自立热”。应该说，这是大学生这10年情绪最为热烈、激昂的时期。
    进入1985年，政治体制改革提出，资产阶级自由化思潮时起时伏，再加上大学生自我意识的不断强化，他们思想行为的热点已开始转向“参与热”、“参政热”、“文化热”、“民主热”。一些大学生已经开始对改革中新旧体制转换过程中出现的矛盾、困难、问题表现出焦虑和不理解，对政治体制改革怀有急切的心理，对官僚主义所造成的在科技引进、外贸工作中引起的失误和问题不满。这种不满情绪和对改革期望值过高的能量积聚，终于酿成了1985年“9·18”学潮。虽然党和政府在肯定学生的爱国热情的同时，对学生上街游行、贴大字报的行为方式持批评和否定态度，但这并未被更多的大学生所理解和接受。
    1986年，当社会上热烈议论政治体制改革时，大学生们兴奋不已。他们中的不少人把经济体制改革中所反映出的种种矛盾和弊端，归结为政治体制改革滞后，对“政治民主”、“新闻自由”表现出浓厚的兴趣。就在这时，社会上的资产阶级自由化思潮再度泛滥，在大学生的思想上产生了种种混乱。当年底到次年初，从合肥、上海等地首先发生了1986年学潮，随后迅疾波及北京以至不少大中城市。就在此时，邓小平同志再次号召“反对资产阶级自由化”。自此，社会开始对大学生投来怀疑的眼光，报刊也不约而同地讨论大学生的弱点。
    1987年以后，许多大学生遁入了心灵的孤岛。他们觉得政府不理解他们爱国的热情，感到委屈。1987年底，署名“郎郎”的大学生写信给《中国青年》杂志，大声呐喊“我们究竟出了什么毛病？！”“郎郎”一度成为大学生的代称。他们陷入了双重的失落：政治失落，人生价值的失落。前者表现出对社会、对政治的冷漠和孤独，发出了“家事、国事、天下事、不关我事”的艾怨。大学生对待“两个基本点”的冷漠态度，确实到了最低点。在资产阶级自由化思潮的巨大影响下，大学生们的思想异常混乱，对党和政府，对社会主义和改革的模糊认识越来越多，信心逐渐下降。不妨看看有关部门1986年6月和1988年6月对首都大学生思想状况的调查数据：认为“靠共产党的领导，中国富强没有希望，主张多党制”的，1986年为20.5％，1988年为21.1％；认为“社会主义与资本主义无优劣之分，主张搞资本主义”的，1986年为16.8％，1988年为34.5％。
    大学生对人生价值的失落，一方面对“通货膨胀”、“知识贬值”、“脑体倒佳”发出种种议论和不满。另一方面，新的“读书无用论”、“经商热”、“跳舞热”、“麻将热”、“恋爱热”充斥校园。
    作为两种失落情绪的折射，1988年发生了两件具有代表性的事件。1988年4月在全国人大和全国政协会议期间，部分高校贴出大字报，强调“教育危机”，认为“知识分子境遇每况愈下”。北京大学的10多个研究生则跑到天安门广场要为人民代表擦皮鞋，其中用意更是显而易见。1988年6月北京大学一名学生因被流氓殴打致死引发了小规模学潮，因处理及时、果断，才未酿成更大范围的学潮，但学生们的情绪是炙手可热的。
    1988年下半年，大学生的思想行为状况不仅没有得到明显矫正，反而更加趋于消极和冷漠。首都某重点大学1988年底一项调查表明，大学生对改革的失望情绪已上升到各种不满情绪的首位。厌学情绪仍然在滋长蔓延，不少学生以“托派”（考“托福”出国）、“麻派”（打麻将）自居。
    大学生是不甘寂寞的一群，他们决不会把消极、冷漠、失望作为自己思想行为的终结点，他们以往的热情只是暂时的凝固，他们参与的欲望仅仅只是一时找不到适当的机会，一旦爆发出来，必然会更加强烈。
    1988年的“《河殇》热”、“东欧、苏联的政治体制改革讨论热”在大学生中悄悄地滚动，发展到冬天，一些高校政治性讲座、讨论、“民主沙龙”开始活跃起来。有的资产阶级自由化的头面人物跑到高校发表演讲，鼓吹“政治多元化”、“经济私有化”。同时，“新权威主义”也在高校成为一个新鲜的话题。随之引起的是学生中盲目的政治情绪在升温。
    面对学生的思想状况，人们在焦虑，学生的冷漠与失望情绪的积淀与离心倾向的聚焦，不知触及哪一个断裂点上，将会发生一场难以收拾的学潮。出于不同的目的，人们都把目光投向“五·四”。作为党、政、教育部门、共青团组织，力图通过纪念“五·四”70周年，把青年学生的情绪通过正常的途径引导到“爱国、奋进、改革、创业”的主题上。而那些心怀叵测的人，则想利用青年学生的情绪和幼稚，借“五·四”发难，掀起大规模的学潮。
    这既是历史的巧合，更是事物发展的必然。正如小平同志指出的，这场风波迟早要来，是由国际大气候和国内小气候决定的。一些人利用胡耀邦同志的逝世，制造了一次建国以来参与人数最多、持续时间最长、内容和形式最为激烈的学潮，并演变成全国性的动乱，最后在北京导致反革命暴乱。就连许多学生在一阵狂热之后，也感到愕然。尽管如此，有相当多的学生还在为自己善良的动机辩解，对社会给予的责难表示出委屈和不满。值得思考的是，几次学潮过后，相当多的学生都未能因此觉悟、警醒，相反，学潮愈演愈烈。学潮果真像有的人所鼓吹的那样代表着时代发展的方向吗？是天然合理的吗？难道不应该对其自身有一点深刻而又真实的剖析？！
    主观愿望与自身素质——处于分离或错位的状态十年动乱对知识的践踏，对人才的摧残，造成了人才的青黄不接。党的十一届三中全会之后，尊重知识、尊重人才，成为一种新的社会时尚。当代大学生，作为青年中的佼佼者和幸运儿，生而逢时，被誉为“天之骄子”、“时代的宠儿”。改革开放成就的激发，社会对大学生的肯定评价，加上个别别有用心的人的吹捧，尤其是“知识分子应该成为社会的主导力量”逐渐成为一种思潮，极大地强化了大学生的优越感和主体意识，突出地表现在他们与一般青年不同的几种主观意识，如精英意识、超越意识、参与意识，形成了一种大学生特有的文化心态。
    精英意识。经过一次又一次的学业竞争与拚搏，进入了大学，自此大学生就为胸前闪光的校徽而骄傲，似乎成了共和国的“高等公民”。在校园里或是公共场合，什么“北大人”、“清华人”、“南开人”，谁都认为自己是人群中的佼佼者。在一个还有近2.5亿文盲、半文盲，一万人中才13个大学生的国度里，大学生无疑是宝贝。特别是人们越来越感到未来世纪的竞争是人才的竞争，大学生作为人才的预备队，自然会迎来羡慕的眼光。这些都潜移默化地使大学生产生了一种优越感，滋长着一种自高自大的情绪，似乎改革也好、建设也好、惩治弊端也好，舍我其谁？有的学生直言不讳地说，10年之后我们就是部长、省长了，至于总理的位置，同样可以问津。正是这种精英意识，把自己摆在一种不适当的位置，不是放在社会之中，而是凌驾于社会之上，其结果只能脱离人民群众，走向与社会现实和人民群众要求相左的方向。
    超越意识。当代大学生思想活跃，批判意识较强，求新的欲望强烈，不满足也不愿意接受现成的结论，对传统的东西表现出天然的反感。当打开中国大门，看到中国落后于发达国家甚远的时候，当看到党和政府在工作中还存在某些失误的时候，当官僚主义、腐败现象蔓延滋长，社会上种种丑恶现象死灰复燃的时候，大学生表现出特有的敏感和不满情绪。他们有着一种强烈的超越意识，由此对西方的“民主”、“自由”、“三权分立”表现出浓厚的兴趣；对西方发达的物质文明和亚洲“四小龙”的经济起飞，极为赞赏；对《河殇》拍手称好，对中国的传统文化表示厌恶。他们恨不能一夜之间就把社会上的种种落后和丑恶铲除干净，他们想一夜之间就使中国成为发达的国家。他们不能容忍现实，意欲超越现实。可是，他们不懂得中国的国情，他们忘记了任何超越只能在中国共产党的领导下，坚持走社会主义道路。他们背离了一切从实际出发，以现实为起点的基本道理。所以，他们往往“躺在床上望着天花板设计着中国的改革蓝图”，不能不产生揠苗助长的天方夜谭式的狂想，甚至有时的举动有点如同抓着自己的头发要离开地球一般的可笑。只是不少大学生不愿意承认这一点而已。
    参与意识。与精英意识和超越意识相联系，大学生还具有强烈的参与意识。他们不满足于对时政的评论，而总想在实际中去表现自己，显示自己。在他们的心目中，社会的发展，民族的兴旺，改革的成功，弊端的铲除，非有大学生的参与不可。他们想通过自己的呐喊，唤起民众的所谓“麻木”；想通过自己的热情点燃所谓的“民主”、“自由”之火；想通过自己的呼唤，推进他们臆想的中国改革进程。由此，他们对把大学生还看成“孩子”表示厌恶，对告诫他们把主要精力放在学习上表示反感。他们就像鼓满了风帆的航船，不待启锚就要冲向大海；他们就像拉满了弓的箭，还未校准目标就要发射。由此可见，他们的热情不免包含着浮躁，他们的参与难免夹杂着盲动。
    值得认真总结和反思的是，在大学生中所具有的精英意识、超越意识和参与意识，使他们自以为是，往往在指责社会和他人的过失时，却回避了自己的不足。正是他们主观愿望和自身素质之间的差距，使他们的行为效果与他们的主观动机相去甚远，甚至背离。
    客观地对大学生的主观意识与自身素质作一番认真分析和比较，我们或许触及到和把握一些大学生的毛病出在哪里。他们对某些干部中的腐败现象疾恶如仇，但以偏概全，因此对四项基本原则产生怀疑和动摇。他们对改革充满了热情，但不了解国情，对改革的期望值过高，对改革的艰巨性、复杂性认识不足，缺少对改革中所遇到的困难和出现的矛盾的承受能力。他们对中外各种思潮表示关注和兴趣，但对马列主义的基本原理所知甚少，表现出对马列主义的偏见和冷漠，甚至认为已经过时了。
    他们对民族文化采取一种鄙视的态度，对西方的思想文化有一种“饥不择食”的兴趣，导致有的学生把资产阶级的哲学奉为经典，唯心主义历史观不知不觉地成为观察问题的方法。他们要求民主，但弄不清民主为何物，往往以西方的资产阶级民主作为参照系，割裂民主与法制的联系，甚至在要求民主的过程中采取了反民主的方式。
    他们强调个人的主体意识，但割裂了个人与集体、与社会的关系，以“自我”作为人生的支点。
    他们对与商品经济相联系的竞争意识、时效观念、效率观念表示欣赏，但又同时萌生着狭隘功利主义、拜金主义、实用主义思想。
    他们要求参与，但参与的热情和要求，与参与的能力和主导思想，表现得极不相称，有时难免成为一种无政府主义的狂热。可见，大学生自身素质的严重缺陷，导致了与其主观愿望所形成的强烈反差，资产阶级自由化思潮必然要乘虚侵袭他们。事实是在去年大学生中已普遍产生了一种跟着感觉走的心态，所以一遇风浪就发生问题。在这次学潮和动乱中，不少同学由跟着感觉走到跟着情绪走，以致发展到听信“美国之音”，跟着谣言走，卷入动乱的泥沼不能自拔。教育与导向——缺乏旗帜鲜明的主旋律
    风波之后，痛定思痛，这么多学生卷入学潮和动乱，决非偶然。究其根本原因，是长期以来削弱思想政治工作、放松马克思主义教育、放松对学生的政治要求，以致资产阶级自由化和其它错误思想侵染学生。
    我们不妨回顾一下近些年国内的小气候问题和社会上对青年学生的一些错误导向，包括对学生的政治导向、思想文化导向、社会价值导向、新闻舆论导向上的一些突出问题，以图引起我们深刻的反省，吸取一些有益的启示。
    政治导向：突出表现在坚持四项基本原则这个根本问题上，不鲜明，不理直气壮，往往只是被作为一种“标准语言”引用在文件中，甚至被视为“套话”、“空话”。赵紫阳同志作为党的总书记竟说什么社会主义道路现在谁也讲不清。这既为搞资产阶级自由化的人壮了胆，也造成了人们极大的思想混乱。在思想理论界，什么社会主义“早产论”、“失败论”，社会主义与资本主义“趋同论”，马克思主义“过时论”，党的领导“淡化论”等等，十分流行。除此之外，长期以来很少讲阶级分析的方法和阶级斗争，只强调宽容、宽松。当和平和发展逐渐成为当今世界的主题时，对国内和平生产和生活看得多，对国际资本主义对我搞“和平演变”的卑劣用心分析揭露少。这些都淡化了人们的阶级意识。特别值得指出的是，资产阶级自由化的头面人物因赵紫阳同志的包庇和纵容，大肆宣传政治上的“多元化”、“多党制”，经济上的“私有化”，鼓吹“全盘西化”，造成了极为恶劣的影响，造成了不少人对四项基本原则的淡漠、怀疑甚至动摇。
    思想文化导向：随着开放，西方资产阶级的思潮和形形色色的理论纷纷涌入我国，而我们缺少认真严肃的分析和扬弃，致使这些东西很快在大学生中流行，冲击着马克思主义的阵地。相反，我们对马列主义、毛泽东思想的宣传十分薄弱，而且往往采取挑剔的态度，使马克思主义在人们的心目中失去了应有的光辉。据首都大学生思想状况调查组的抽样调查，有22.7％的人认为马克思主义仅仅是一门科学，与其它科学是平权的，不能指导其他科学。在有的学校持这种看法的人达53.1％。某院对研究生一次调查，认为科技人员“不必掌握马克思主义科学”的人占11.7％，认为“略知一二即可”的占24.9％。相反，在校园内出现了“萨特热”、“弗洛伊德热”、“尼采热”、“《河殇》热”。什么《自我论》、《首脑论》、《熵——一种新的世界观》、《人性的优点》、《人性的弱点》、《丑陋的中国人》成为大学生的流行书目。这种潜移默化的影响，使个人主义的思想、唯心历史观、民族虚无主义侵入到学生的头脑中。
    社会价值导向：价值观是人生观的核心。我们所崇尚的社会价值观是集体主义，是为人民服务，是奉献精神，是把自己的理想、前途、命运和国家、民族、人民的前途、命运联系起来。这种共产主义的道德观、价值观与资产阶级的道德观、价值观的对立，最根本的是集体主义和个人主义的对立，是社会本位与个人本位的对立。而个人主义和个人本位的基本特征是以个人的利益为出发点和归宿，我就是一切。一个时期以来，我们很少宣传集体主义、奉献精神、为人民服务。相反，有人还攻击“雷锋精神”是“左”的产物。更有甚者，打着“观念更新”的招牌，大肆鼓吹“一切向钱看”的“实惠论”，鼓噪要突出“自我”，进行“人性复归”。这种唯我主义的渲染，使一些大学生把“我就是目的、我就是一切”、“我最崇尚我自己”作为人生的格言。正是这种以“自我”为中心的人生观，必然成为政治上的无政府主义和利益上的利已主义的思想基础，其结果势必在利益要求上只求索取，不讲奉献；在人与人的关系上，唯利是图；在个人与国家的关系上，凌驾于国家和社会之上。
    新闻舆论导向：现代社会，信息传播媒介趋向大众化、社会化。新闻舆论的导向直接影响着群众的情绪和思想走向，它既是群众情绪的指示剂，也是群众情绪的催化剂。良好的新闻舆论能形成健康向上的舆论环境，产生凝聚向上的力量，错误的新闻舆论则造成人们思想的混乱。回顾这些年来新闻舆论导向，青年学生中形成的诸多“热点”，与新闻舆论导向有着重要的关系。如：“潘晓讨论”的结果，无疑使一些个人主义的观点理论化、系统化。报刊关于“T”型人才、开拓型人才、尖子人才的宣传，使人们对人才的理解产生了片面性，产生了重智轻德的倾向。学生中形成的“西方哲学思潮热”、“政治体制改革热”、“中西文化比较热”、“《河殇》热”等等，都与新闻舆论的渲染不无关系。至于人们当时疑惑不解的“蛇口风波”，则被某些报刊极力渲染，有人借机否定社会主义的思想政治工作，导致了思想政治工作领域和群众思想的极度混乱。回想这次风波的骤然升级，无疑与新闻舆论的错误导向以及推波助澜有关，这个教训是十分深刻的。出路与途径——四项基本原则是育人之本
    邓小平同志深刻指出，十年来最大的失误是教育，思想政治工作薄弱。反思这次风波所暴露出的我们教育中存在的问题，最根本的是放松了对青年学生的四项基本原则教育，忽视了学生的政治方向的培养和引导，导致许多学生受资产阶级自由化的影响，在政治方向上发生了偏离。要清醒地认识到，现在的青年学生是跨世纪的一代，历史将要把他们推到接班者的位置。
    为国家计，为民族计，为社会主义前途计，从学校到社会到家庭，从思想理论意识形态到教育、新闻、出版，都应全面贯彻党的教育方针，把四项基本原则作为教育之本，渗透到学生成长的各个环节，当前要特别注意抓好几个方面的教育。即坚持不懈地进行马克思主义教育；坚持爱国主义和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教育；坚持社会主义民主与法制的教育；加强对学生进行国情教育和社会实践的教育。有党的领导，有马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的指导，中国的青年一代是完全有希望有作为的。
    今天的大学生一定会从正反两方面的教训中清醒起来，成熟起来，同我们伟大的共和国一起成长，肩负起建设21世纪的伟大历史使命。
