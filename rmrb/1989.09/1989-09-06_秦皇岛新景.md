The beautiful city of Qinhuangdao has added new scenery. The only competition venue outside Beijing for the 11th Asian Games—the Qinhuangdao Marine Sports Field—has been basically completed and is ready to welcome its first guests: the representatives of the 5th Asian Sailing Championships.

The Marine Sports Field is located on the western coast of the Tang River estuary in the western part of Qinhuangdao Port. This area has a small tidal range and good water quality, making it an ideal venue for sailing competitions.

At the entrance, there is an 18-meter-tall glass-reinforced plastic sculpture depicting a sailor struggling against the waves. The design of the top of the command tower is exquisite and ingenious, cleverly using the color contrast between brown glass and white buildings to form the shape of the Arabic numeral 11. Inside the command tower, there are various advanced communication equipment, gender verification rooms, anti-doping testing rooms, medical aid rooms, and other necessary facilities. The harbor dock is the most magnificent, with a 1,300-meter-long breakwater. From the outlet of the breakwater, there are two racing areas with diameters of 2,100 meters and 2,900 meters, respectively.

The athletes' service center, designed by the Beijing Municipal Urban Construction Development Research and Design Institute, has a different style. To provide athletes with a good rest environment, the service center has 340 rooms and 5 independent villas, as well as a multi-functional hall, Chinese and Western restaurants, bars, commercial, communication, and recreation centers, which can accommodate 700 athletes and staff. After the Asian Games, it will be open to the public as a tourist and conference facility. After inspecting the Qinhuangdao Marine Sports Field, Mr. Henderson, Vice President of the International Sailing Federation, praised it highly, believing that it is not only suitable for the Asian Games but also for the Olympic Games.

    秦皇岛新景
    马钢军　余忠
    美丽的秦皇岛又添新景。第十一届亚运会唯一设在北京以外的比赛场——秦皇岛海上运动场已基本完工，准备迎接它的第一批客人——第五届亚洲帆船锦标赛的各国代表。
    海上运动场位于秦皇岛市海港西部的汤河入海口西侧海岸，这里潮差小，水质好，是理想的帆船赛场。
    入口处，是一尊高达18米的玻璃钢雕塑，塑造了一个帆船运动员正在惊涛骇浪中奋力搏击的形象。船形指挥楼的顶端设计得精巧、别致，巧妙地利用茶色玻璃与白色建筑的色差组成了阿拉伯数字11的造型。在指挥楼中设有各种先进的通信设备，性别、兴奋剂检查室，医疗救护室等必要设施。港池码头显得最为壮观，有全长1300余米的防浪堤，从大堤出口处向外是两个直径分别为2100米和2900米的赛区。
    由北京市城建开发科研设计所设计的运动员服务处，则另有一种风格。为给运动员提供良好的休息环境，服务处设有340间客房和5幢独立式别墅，并设有多功能厅，中、西餐厅，酒吧、商业、通讯、康乐中心等服务设施，可接待运动员和工作人员700人。亚运会后，将做为旅游、会议设施对外开放。国际帆船联合会副主席亨德森先生在视察秦皇岛海上运动场后，赞不绝口，认为这里不仅能举办亚运会，也可举办奥运会。
