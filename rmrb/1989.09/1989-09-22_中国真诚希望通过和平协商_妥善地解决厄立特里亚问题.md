Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing said at a press conference today that China genuinely hopes that the Eritrean issue can be resolved through peaceful negotiations, overcoming various difficulties, and ultimately achieving a proper solution, which will benefit the social stability and economic development of Ethiopia.

He made these remarks in response to a reporter's question.

The reporter's question was: Recently, representatives of the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front held talks in Atlanta, USA, on the peaceful resolution of the Eritrean issue. What is the Chinese government's comment on this?

Li Zhaoxing said: "We have noted that on June 5 of this year, the special session of the Ethiopian National Assembly proposed a six-point initiative for the peaceful resolution of the Eritrean issue. This is an active effort by the Ethiopian government to end the northern conflict and maintain national unity as soon as possible. The Atlanta talks are the first step for Ethiopia to end the conflict and move towards peace. We appreciate this."

    中国真诚希望通过和平协商
    妥善地解决厄立特里亚问题
    新华社北京9月21日电　外交部发言人李肇星今天在新闻发布会上说，中国真诚希望厄立特里亚问题能够通过和平协商，排除种种困难，最终得到妥善解决，以利于埃塞俄比亚的社会稳定和经济发展。
    他是在回答记者的提问时说这番话的。
    记者的问题是：最近埃塞俄比亚政府和厄立特里亚人民解放阵线的代表在美国亚特兰大就和平解决厄立特里亚问题举行会谈。中国政府对此有何评论？
    李肇星说：“我们注意到今年6月5日埃塞俄比亚国民议会特别会议提出了和平解决厄立特里亚问题6点倡议。这是埃塞俄比亚政府为早日结束北方战乱、维护国家统一而做的积极努力。亚特兰大会谈是埃塞俄比亚结束战乱、走向和平的第一步。我们对此表示赞赏。”
