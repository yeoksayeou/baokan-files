Recently, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Galvin, said in an interview with the West German *Welt am Sonntag* that NATO will significantly reduce the number of actual troops participating in military exercises in the future, replacing them with computer-simulated exercises.

Galvin said that the three military exercises NATO will conduct in September this year will all reflect this requirement.

Additionally, the military training named "Ace 89" to be held in November in Ramstein, West Germany, will be conducted entirely through computers. The eight divisions participating in the training will not leave their barracks, and the training situation can be broadcast via satellite.

    计算机模拟军事演习
    最近北约欧洲盟军最高司令加尔文在接受西德《星期日世界报》记者采访时说，北约今后在举行军事演习时，将大量削减参加演习的实际部队人数，而代之以通过计算机进行的模拟演习。
    加尔文说，今年9月北约将要举行的三次军事演习都将体现上述要求。
    此外，将于11月在西德拉姆斯泰因举行的名为“王牌89”的军事训练将全部通过计算机进行，参加训练的8个军团将全部不出兵营，训练情况可通过卫星进行转播。
