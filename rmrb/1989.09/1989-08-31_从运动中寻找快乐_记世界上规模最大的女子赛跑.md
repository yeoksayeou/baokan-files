On Sunday, August 27th, it was the day of the Stockholm Women's 10km Run. Gunilla couldn't find anyone to take care of her child that day, but she still joined the race. When Gunilla pushed her blue baby carriage, carrying her 11-week-old daughter, and completed the entire course, everyone present was moved and cheered and congratulated her.

This was a race of special significance, and it was also the largest women's race in the world, aiming to attract more women to participate in sports, not focusing on winning or losing. Participants could either run continuously or walk and run intermittently. The organizers calculated the time and results for the first 1500 participants, while the rest were categorized into levels such as "fast runners," "average runners," "fast walk-runners," and "average walk-runners" based on their arrival order at the finish line. Anyone who completed the course within 70 minutes would receive a commemorative badge and certificate.

The race started at 2 PM, with both the starting and finishing points set near the television tower on a large lawn. It is understood that the average age of the women participating in this year's race was 35, with most being amateur sports enthusiasts, and there were also some excellent long-distance runners. To prepare for this race, they practiced an average of twice a week starting from April.

Since the race was not as tense and arduous as usual competitions, many women found joy in participating. During the race, husbands, fiancés, or boyfriends cheered for their wives, fiancées, or girlfriends, while children cheered for their mothers. The race was filled with a festive atmosphere.

Among the participants, there were many mothers and daughters, and even grandmothers and granddaughters. One middle-aged woman had "Mom" written on her back, and the three girls running beside her had "Daughter 1," "Daughter 2," and "Daughter 3" written on their backs. After reaching the finish line, the mother said, "We ran together the whole time." The daughters said that their father and little brother formed their cheerleading squad.

Many women participated in the race in groups, with 42 women from the northern Swedish border city of Haparanda being particularly notable. They all worked at the same hospital, traveled 1100 kilometers by car to Stockholm to participate in the race, and then returned to Haparanda together that night.

There were even disabled participants. When a 27-year-old girl in a wheelchair reached the finish line, the audience applauded her enthusiastically.

Since the Stockholm Women's 10km Run began, a famous "undefeated champion" has been 47-year-old Aivi Palm. In a total of 6 races, she won the championship 5 times and was the runner-up in 1987.

Currently, this race is increasingly loved by more Swedish women.

### 从运动中寻找快乐——记世界上规模最大的女子赛跑

    从运动中寻找快乐
    ——记世界上规模最大的女子赛跑
    8月27日星期天，是斯德哥尔摩女子10公里赛跑的日子。古尼拉这天未能找到人替她看管孩子，但她还是加入了比赛的行列。当古尼拉手推蓝色婴儿车，带着出生仅11周的女儿跑完全程时，在场的人无不动情，纷纷向她欢呼和祝贺。
    这是具有特殊意义的比赛，亦是世界上规模最大的女子赛跑，旨在吸引更多妇女参加体育运动，而不以输赢论高低。参赛者可以连续长跑，也可以时走时跑。比赛组织者为前1500名计算时间和成绩，其余选手则按到达终点的先后分列“跑得快”、“跑得一般”、“走跑交替快”、“走跑交替一般”等几个级别计算结果。凡在70分钟内跑完全程的人，都可以获得纪念章和证书。
    这次比赛从下午2点开始，起点和终点都设在电视塔附近的大草坪上。据了解，参加今年比赛的妇女平均年龄35岁，她们中以业余体育爱好者为主，也不乏优秀长跑好手。为了参加这次比赛，从4月份起，她们平均每周练习两次。
    由于不像一般比赛那样紧张和艰苦，许多妇女以参赛为乐事。比赛时，丈夫、未婚夫或男友为妻子、未婚妻或女友助威，孩子们则为妈妈加油。比赛充满了节日般的欢乐气氛。
    在参赛者中，不少是母亲和女儿，甚至还有奶奶和孙女。有一位中年妇女背后写着“妈妈”，跑在她身边的三个姑娘背后则分别写着“女儿1”、“女儿2”和“女儿3”。这位母亲到达终点后说：“我们始终跑在一起。”女儿们则说，爸爸和小弟弟组成了她们的拉拉队。
    有不少妇女是集体参加比赛的，其中来自北方瑞芬边境城市哈帕兰达的42名妇女特别引人注目。她们在同一医院工作，乘车行程1100公里一起来到斯德哥尔摩，参加比赛后她们于当晚一起赶回哈帕兰达。
    参赛的甚至还有残疾人，当一位乘坐轮椅的27岁姑娘到达终点时，观众为她热烈鼓掌。
    自斯德哥尔摩女子10公里赛跑举办以来，一位著名的
  “常胜将军”是47岁的艾维·帕尔姆。在总共6次比赛中，她5次获得冠军，只有1987年居亚军。
    目前，这项比赛受到越来越多瑞典妇女的喜爱。新华社记者　陈文英　许福瑞
