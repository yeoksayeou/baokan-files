Poland's new Prime Minister Mazowiecki has announced that he will delay the completion of his cabinet formation until September 10. He said in a televised address last night in Warsaw that the process of forming the government is "difficult and extraordinarily complex," and he cannot complete the task on schedule.

Mazowiecki is a key advisor to Lech Walesa, the chairman of Solidarity. The new government he is tasked with forming will be the first in over 40 years to be led by non-communist party members. After being appointed Prime Minister by the Polish parliament on August 24, he promised to form a new cabinet by the end of August and submit the list of government members to the parliament. However, in his televised address on the evening of August 31, he stated that completing this task "requires more time."

Since being tasked with forming the government a week ago, the new Prime Minister has frequently consulted with the United Peasants Party, the Democratic Party, the United Workers' Party, and various social organizations on the matter of forming a new government. It is reported that, in addition to the Prime Minister, Solidarity will also have one deputy prime minister in the new government, and the aforementioned three parties will each have one deputy prime minister. There is little disagreement on this arrangement. However, there are differing opinions and disputes over the allocation of ministerial positions in the government, especially regarding which party will head some key departments.

In the process of forming the new cabinet, the most prominent differences have been between Solidarity and the United Workers' Party. The United Workers' Party has stated that it will support and participate in the government led by Mazowiecki, but "the representatives of the United Workers' Party in the new government must be in accordance with its political strength and administrative power in the state." According to prior agreements, the new government's Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior will continue to be headed by United Workers' Party members. However, in recent days, Solidarity has proposed that these two ministries should not be solely headed by the United Workers' Party, and that "non-partisan" individuals should be appointed as deputy ministers. At the same time, it opposes the United Workers' Party heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Propaganda, and other departments, advocating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be headed by members of Solidarity or the United Peasants' Party. On August 29, Miler, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party's Political Bureau, spoke to the press, saying that the current Foreign Minister Olechowski (a member of the United Workers' Party) is the "best candidate for foreign minister" in the new government. The next day, Jerzy Gelezynski, chairman of the Solidarity parliamentary group, stated that he advocated "limiting the participation of communists" in the new government and opposed "allowing communists to monopolize foreign policy affairs." He also stated that "it must end" the United Workers' Party's long-term leadership over broadcasting, television, and other mass media tools, and firmly said that "there is no room for negotiation on this point."

Solidarity, which has allied with the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, also has differing opinions on the arrangement of ministerial positions. According to various sources, the United Peasants' Party advocates that one of its members should be appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, believing that this ministry is the "traditional domain" of the Peasants' Party; however, Solidarity insists that the Agricultural Union representative should head this ministry. Regarding the position of the Minister of Justice, Solidarity believes that the Ministry of Justice is a "key department for political system reform," and therefore the position of the minister should be theirs, while the Democratic Party believes that it is more appropriate for an expert from the Democratic Party to be the Minister of Justice.

In addition to the difficulties in personnel arrangements, the new Prime Minister has not yet formulated an emergency short-term action plan or a long-term program to address domestic economic and social issues. According to Solidarity leaders, a committee is currently drafting an economic program for the new government.

    波新总理未能如期组成新政府
    据宣布，波兰新任总理马佐维耶茨基已将完成组阁任务的期限推迟到9月10日以前。他昨晚在华沙发表电视讲话说，由于组阁过程“艰难而且异常复杂”，他不能如期完成这一任务。
    马佐维耶茨基是波团结工会主席瓦文萨的主要顾问，他受命组织的新政府，将是40多年来波兰第一个由非共产党人领导的政府。在8月24日波议会任命他为总理后，他向议会许诺，他将于8月底组成新内阁并向议会提出政府组成名单。然而，他在8月31日晚上的电视讲话中说，完成这一任务“需要更多的时间”。
    新总理受命组阁一周来，与统一农民党、民主党、统一工人党及各社会组织就组织新政府问题频繁进行磋商。有消息说，团结工会除总理外，还将在新政府中出一位副总理，上述三党也将各出一位副总理。对这一方案，各方已无多大异议。但是，对政府各部部长名额的分配，特别是在由哪一党派主持一些关键部门的问题上，则意见不一，争执不下。
    在组织新内阁过程中，团结工会与统一工人党的分歧最明显。统一工人党声明，它将支持并参加马佐维耶茨基为首的政府，但“新政府中统一工人党的代表，必须符合它的政治实力和在国家行政方面的实力”。根据事前达成的默契，新政府的国防部和内务部将继续由统一工人党党员任部长。然而近几天团结工会方面提出，不能让波党单独主持这两个部，要由“无党派人士”出任这两个部的副职。它同时反对统一工人党人主持外交、新闻宣传等部门，主张由团结工会或统一农民党人士出掌外交部。8月29日，波党中央政治局委员米莱尔向报界发表谈话，认为现任外长奥莱霍夫斯基（波党员）是新政府“最好的外长人选”。第二天，团结工会议会议员团主席盖莱梅克就发表谈话说，他主张“限制共产党人”参加新政府，反对“让共产党人垄断对外政策事务”。他同时表示，“必须结束”波党长期来对广播、电视等大众传播工具的领导，断然说“在这一点上没有讨价还价的余地”。
    团结工会同已与它结盟的统一农民党、民主党对部长席位的安排也有分歧。据各方消息，统一农民党主张由该党党员出任农业部长，认为这个部是农民党人“传统的领域”；而团结工会方面则要求让团结农会代表主持这个部。关于司法部长的职位，团结工会认为司法部是“政治体制改革的重点部门”，因而该部部长职位非它莫属，而民主党则认为由民主党的专家任司法部长“更为合适”。
    除人事安排的困难外，新总理还没有对付国内经济社会问题的应急短期行动计划和长期纲领。据团结工会领导人透露，有一个委员会正在为新政府拟订经济纲领。（新华社华沙9月1日电）
