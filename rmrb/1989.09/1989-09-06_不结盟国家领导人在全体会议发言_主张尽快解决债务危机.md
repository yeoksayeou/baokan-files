Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, September 5th. Correspondent Yan Zheng reports: Leaders of the non-aligned countries attending the 9th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement delivered speeches at the plenary session on September 4, strongly advocating for an urgent resolution to the debt crisis.

Yugoslav Federal Presidency Chairman Branko Mikulić stated that the high-interest policies pursued by developed countries have led to capital outflows from developing countries, stalling economic development, lowering living standards, and increasing social pressures. Developed countries bear significant responsibility for this situation.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said that developing countries are essentially "bleeding" for their external debts. From 1982 to 1988, the debt of developing countries increased from $850 billion to $1.24 trillion. Their industrial investments have also stagnated.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stated that debtor nations and creditor nations should engage in "intense dialogue" to formulate a global strategy for resolving the debt issue.

Peruvian President Alan García Pérez pointed out that "the dollar, interest rates, and external debt are now ruling the world."

Ecuadorian President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos noted that the debt issue has become an obstacle to the continued development of Latin American and Caribbean countries. This is not just a financial issue but also a political one.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda referred to the external debts of developing countries as "a symbol of the North exploiting the South."

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad believes that the only way to resolve the debt crisis is to cancel all or most of the debts.

Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi called for the Non-Aligned Movement to unite and complete the arduous task of resolving the debt problem.
