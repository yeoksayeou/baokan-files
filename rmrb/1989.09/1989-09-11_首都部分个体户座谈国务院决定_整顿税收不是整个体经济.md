The State Council’s “Decision on Strengthening Tax Collection and Administration for Urban and Rural Individual Households and Private Enterprises” has sparked widespread discussion. Recently, some individual households in the capital who attended a meeting to study and implement the State Council’s decision believe that strengthening tax collection and administration for individual households and private enterprises is aimed at ensuring the healthy development of the individual economy.

Vice Chairman of the China Individual Labor Association, Fei Kaijun, said that in recent days, the number of certified individual households nationwide has decreased, and negative aspects of individual households have been widely reported. Now, with the strengthening of tax collection and administration for individual households, some people have doubts: Is the Party and the government changing its policy towards individual households? This is a complete misunderstanding. The State Council’s decision clearly states that the policy of encouragement will continue, and this policy has not changed. As for the tax regulations for individual households, they were issued a few years ago and have not changed now.

Hu Dapeng, who is engaged in home appliance repair, said that there are indeed people among individual households who become rich through tax evasion. In the future, we should strengthen management and establish a mechanism to ensure that law-abiding individual households who pay taxes according to the law are both rich and honorable, while those who engage in illegal operations and evade taxes will neither be rich nor honorable.

Zhao Deli, an individual household from Xicheng District, said that in the past, various supervision and management measures were not strict, and both the public and individual households had complaints, saying that the bold would prosper while the timid would starve. This time, the tax rectification must not be a passing fad.

While expressing their firm support for the State Council’s decision, the individual households present also made positive suggestions regarding the current tax collection and administration work.

It is reported that the China Individual Labor Association has made arrangements for how to implement the State Council’s decision, emphasizing that individual laborers are direct beneficiaries of the reform and opening up, and that paying taxes in accordance with the law is an obligation that cannot be shirked.

　　首都部分个体户座谈国务院决定
　　整顿税收不是整个体经济
    本报北京9月11日讯　记者潘岗报道：国务院《关于大力加强城乡个体工商户和私营企业税收征管工作的决定》发布后，引起广泛反响。日前，出席学习贯彻国务院决定座谈会的首都部分个体户认为：加强个体户、私营企业税收征管工作，是为了保证个体经济健康发展。
    中国个体劳协副会长费开龙说，前些日子，全国城乡有证照的个体户有所下降，社会上对个体户的消极面反映比较多，现在又要加强个体户的税收征管工作，有人便产生了疑虑：是不是党和政府对个体工商户的政策要变了？这完全是误解。国务院决定讲的明明白白，要继续鼓励，这个方针没有变。至于对个体户的税收法规，前几年就颁布了，现在也没有变。
    从事家电修理的胡大鹏说，要看到在个体户中靠偷税漏税发财的人确实有。今后应该通过加强管理，形成一种机制，让那些守法经营、照章纳税的个体户既富又光荣，让那些靠非法经营、靠偷漏税款的人既富不了，也不光彩。
    西城区个体户赵德利说，过去各种监督管理办法不严，群众有意见，个体户也有意见，说是撑死胆大的，饿死胆小的。这次税收整顿，一定不要一阵风。
    与会个体户在表示坚决拥护国务院决定的同时，还就目前的税收征管工作提出了积极建议。
    据悉，中国个体劳动者协会已就如何贯彻国务院决定作了部署，强调个体劳动者是改革开放的直接受益者，依法纳税是义不容辞的义务。
