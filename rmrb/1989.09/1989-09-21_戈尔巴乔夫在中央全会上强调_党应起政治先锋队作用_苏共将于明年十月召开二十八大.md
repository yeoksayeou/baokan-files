Gorbachev, the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, emphasized today at the CPSU Central Committee Plenum that the Party should play the role of a political vanguard in society.

He pointed out that at present, when key issues of social development are being debated in the realms of ideology and politics, the Party's statements, positions, organizational work, and ideological work are of extreme importance. As the initiator of revolutionary reforms and social democratization, the CPSU must set special requirements for itself to establish the right to act as a vanguard in society through action.

Gorbachev said that heated debates are already underway within the Party. The issue is to make this debate more constructive, to help unite the Party and various social forces that stand on the side of reform, and to overcome confusion and panic.

He criticized those who attempt to create the impression that the revolutionary changes of the past few years have occurred without the Party's participation, portraying the Party as a conservative force. Others view the Party's self-criticism as a sign of abandoning political and ideological positions and ceasing to play a political role. He stressed that the Party is the embodiment of the programmatic goals of reform and is a force for unity and cohesion.

He also called for immediate and decisive action, first to alleviate the tension in the supply of daily necessities, eliminate commodity shortages, and rectify commercial order, and to ensure improvement in the shortest possible time.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenum, which opened today, decided to convene the 28th Party Congress in October 1990. The Plenum also set the agenda for the Congress with four items: 1. The CPSU Central Committee will report on the progress of reforms and the Party's tasks; 2. The CPSU Central Commission for Audits will report; 3. The CPSU Constitution; 4. Election of the Party Central Committee.

After passing the above decisions, the CPSU Central Committee Plenum began discussing the nationalities issue. Gorbachev delivered a report on the Party's nationalities policy under contemporary conditions.

    戈尔巴乔夫在中央全会上强调
    党应起政治先锋队作用
    苏共将于明年十月召开二十八大
    新华社莫斯科9月19日电  （记者唐修哲）苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫今天在苏共中央全会上强调，党在社会上应起“政治先锋队的作用”。
    他指出，当今天围绕着社会发展的关键性问题进行着思想和政治斗争的时候，党的言论、立场、组织和意识形态工作具有极为重要的意义。作为革命性改革和社会民主化的倡议者，苏共应对自身提出特殊的要求，以行动来确立在社会上起先锋作用的权利。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，党内现在已经展开了热烈的争论。问题在于要使这场争论具有更多的建设性，有助于团结党和各种站在改革立场上的社会力量，摆脱思想混乱和惊慌不安的情绪。
    他批评一些人企图造成这样的印象，似乎这几年的革命变化是在没有党参加的情况下发生的，这些人把党描绘成保守势力；而另一些人则把党的自我批评看作是放弃政治和思想阵地，不再起政治作用的征兆。他强调党是改革的纲领性目标的体现者，是团结和联合的力量。
    他还号召现在就要行动起来，而且是刻不容缓地坚决行动，首先缓和日用品供应紧张、消除商品短缺和整顿商业秩序，要在最短时间内保证好转。
    新华社莫斯科9月19日电今天开幕的苏共中央全会通过了在1990年10月召开第28次代表大会的决定。全会并确定了代表大会的四项议程：1、苏共中央委员会作关于改革进程和党的任务的报告；2、苏共中央检查委员会报告；3、关于苏共章程；4、选举党中央机构。
    苏共中央全会在通过上述决定后已开始讨论民族问题。戈尔巴乔夫就此问题作了党在当代条件下的民族政策的报告。
