Editor's Note:

Since the reform and opening up, individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises have spread throughout the country. With the support of local governments and various departments such as finance, commerce, light industry, materials, banking, and industrial and commercial administration, they have fully utilized their own vitality, playing a crucial role in developing production, activating the market, facilitating life, and expanding employment. However, due to the widespread tax evasion and tax avoidance among individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises, many of them have amassed great wealth, leading to severe social inequality. This has inevitably drawn criticism from the public and attention from society.

Taxation is a means by which the state, through its authority and in accordance with legal provisions, compulsorily and without compensation, participates in the distribution and redistribution of national income. Whether the entities and individuals directly responsible for paying taxes comply with the law and pay taxes as required directly affects the state's fiscal revenue. The characteristics of taxation are as follows: first, compulsion, where the state compels taxpayers to pay taxes; second, non-compensation, where the state does not provide any compensation after collecting taxes; third, fixedness, where the state pre-determines the objects and rates of taxation, and taxpayers pay taxes according to these fixed rates. It is precisely because of these characteristics of taxation that some individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprise owners, driven by profit and with impure motives, resort to deception, concealment, resistance, or even bribery of tax officials to engage in illegal activities such as tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax resistance. They pocket the taxes that should be collected from the people and used for the people, resulting in a situation where the national treasury loses revenue while individuals amass fortunes. From the information reported from various places, to address this abnormal phenomenon, we must first establish strict systems. According to the changing situation, timely measures should be taken to make the taxation objects, taxpayers, tax rates, tax exemptions, and penalty procedures as perfect as possible, leaving no loopholes. Second, strict management must be enforced, including tax registration, tax assessment, tax reporting, tax inspection, and penalty for violations. Third, strict taxation must be implemented, which requires coordination among the tax, commercial, industrial and commercial administration, and judicial departments. In particular, tax authorities and tax officials must not show favoritism, strictly enforce the law, and never use the power to collect taxes as a means to seek personal gain or extort money.

Our efforts to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance by individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises do not mean that the Party and the state's policies and laws regarding the development of the individual economy are changing. As a supplementary form of laborer's individual economy to the socialist public economy, we will continue to support and develop it, protecting their legitimate rights and interests. However, those engaged in individual operations must abide by the law, manage their businesses well, pay taxes according to the law, and not disappoint the expectations of the state and the people. They should do more things that benefit society and the people.

### 严格制度  严格管理　严格税收

    严格制度  严格管理　严格税收
    改革开放以来，个体工商户、私营企业散布在祖国的各个角落。他们在各地政府及其财政、商业、轻工、物资、银行、工商行政管理等部门的扶持下，充分发挥自己的活力，在发展生产、活跃市场、方便生活、扩大就业等方面，起着十分重要的作用。然而，由于个体工商户、私营企业中的大量偷税、漏税，致使他们之中许多人发了大财，造成现今社会分配严重不公。这不能不引起群众的非难和社会的关注。
    税收，是国家凭借权力，依照法律规定的标准，强制地、无偿地参与国民经济收入分配和再分配的一种手段。直接负有纳税义务的单位和个人是否依法照章纳税，直接影响着国家的财政收入。税收的特征，一是强制性，国家依权强制向纳税人征收税款；二是无偿性，国家征税后不付任何报酬；三是固定性，国家预先规定了征税对象和征税数额的比例，纳税人依照规定的比例固定纳税。正因为税收的这种特征，那些唯利是图、心地卑污的个体工商户、私营企业主，采取欺骗、隐瞒、抗拒或拉拢腐蚀税务干部等手法，干起偷税、漏税、抗税的违法事情来，把应该取之于民、用之于民的税款，装入自己的腰包，形成一边是国库减少了收入，一边是私人腰缠万贯的现象。从各地反映的情况看，要解决这种反常的现象，首先要严格制度，根据不断变化的形势，及时制定对策，尽可能在征税对象、纳税人、税率、减税免税、违章处理等环节上，做到天衣无缝，无隙可钻。其次要严格管理，做好税收登记、纳税鉴定、纳税报表、税务检查和违法处罚工作。第三要严格税收，这就要求税务、商业、工商行政管理、司法等部门相互配合。特别是税务机关和税务干部，要不徇私情，严格执法，绝对不能把征税大权作为谋取私利、敲诈勒索的工具。
    我们狠抓个体工商户和私营企业的偷税、漏税问题，是不是说党和国家有关发展个体经济的政策和法律要变？不是的。作为对社会主义公有制经济补充的劳动者个体经济，我们还是要扶持发展，保护他们的合法权益。但是，从事个体经营的人，必须遵纪守法，搞好经营，照章纳税，不辜负国家和人民的期望，多做有益于社会、有益于人民的事情。
