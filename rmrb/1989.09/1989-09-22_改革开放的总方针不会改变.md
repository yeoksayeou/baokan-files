The counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing has been suppressed. Will there be any significant changes in China's major policies and basic direction? The people of the entire country are very concerned, and international public opinion is full of speculation. The focus of the discussion is whether the general policy of reform and opening up will change. To this day, the discussion has not subsided, so it is necessary to clarify our views on this issue.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out in his speech to the military leaders of the martial law troops in the capital that the "one central task, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress is correct. We must continue and steadfastly carry it out. We must make our steps in reform and opening up more stable, better, and even faster. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee solemnly declared: "The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and must be adhered to without wavering and consistently. Reform and opening up are the path to national strength and must be steadfastly and consistently implemented. We will not return to the old path of closing the door to the outside world." Over the past three months, in the speeches of the Party and state leaders and in all of China's external activities, this position has been repeatedly stated.

The reason why the general policy of reform and opening up will not change is determined by two basic factors. First, implementing the general policy of reform and opening up is a necessary trend in the development of Chinese socialism and an objective requirement for further liberating and developing productive forces. The socialist system is the most advanced social system in human history to date. However, if we do not break out of the closed state and do not reform the rigid model, we cannot rapidly develop productive forces and cannot fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. In today's world of rapidly developing economics and technology, without reform and opening up, China will have difficulty finding a foothold in the world. Second, this objective requirement has been recognized by the vast majority of people in China. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as soon as we implemented reform and opening up, the development of the economy, the enhancement of national strength, the improvement of people's living standards, and other aspects of progress were much faster than before. History is the best teacher. Comparing the past with the present, people are convinced that to make the Chinese nation prosperous and strong, there is no other way but reform and opening up. If "China must reform and open up" was only the recognition of a few people before and after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, then after 10 years of practice, "China must reform and open up" has become the consensus of 1.1 billion people and has become the common practice and common demand of the people. Reform and opening up are in line with the trend of the times and meet the needs of the people. It is not something that can be changed by anyone. To achieve a moderately prosperous society by the end of this century, to reach the level of a moderately developed country by the middle of the next century, and to catch up in the fierce international competition, we must be even bolder in reform and even bolder in opening up. Emphasizing that the general policy of reform and opening up must be steadfastly implemented reflects the objective laws of social development and the fundamental interests of the people.

"Now that we are emphasizing the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, there is a lack of atmosphere for reform and opening up. How can we guarantee that the policy of reform and opening up will not change?" This is an important reason why some people at home and abroad have doubts about our implementation of reform and opening up. In fact, this is a great misunderstanding. The Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up are interrelated, interdependent, and unified in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The reform and opening up we talk about is reform and opening up on the basis of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles. However, over the past few years, some people have viewed reform and opening up from the perspective of bourgeois liberalization and opposed adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles. The "reform" they talk about is actually to change to capitalism; the "opening up" they talk about is actually to make China a vassal state of imperialism. This so-called "reform and opening up" is completely different from what we talk about. It can be seen that on the issue of reform and opening up, there are two completely different lines of thought and two completely different viewpoints. From our line of thought and viewpoint, the four upholds and reform and opening up are both indispensable, and neither aspect should be weakened. Based on the actual situation over the past few years, where the four upholds have not been grasped enough and the struggle against bourgeois liberalization has not been effective, it is very necessary to emphasize that we must seriously grasp them and persist in doing so. This will only provide a more solid foundation and stronger guarantee for reform and opening up, rather than hindering reform and opening up.

"Now that we are talking about preventing peaceful evolution, how can we talk about adhering to opening up to the outside world?" This is a confusion of two issues. It is true that we must be vigilant against the plots of hostile forces abroad to carry out peaceful evolution in China and must always expose and smash all their evil intentions in this regard. At the same time, we must, as before, develop relations with all countries and regions on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; continue to implement the policy of opening up, absorb foreign capital, technology, advanced management experience, etc., and use them for our own purposes to accelerate the modernization of our country. This is steadfast. We will not stop eating because of choking. Adhering to the established basic economic and political systems and pursuing the rapid development of economics, science and technology, and cultural undertakings are two aspects of one thing. We firmly oppose certain political forces abroad trying to carry out peaceful evolution in China; we welcome and are willing to increase exchanges with the governments of various countries and numerous businesspeople to do business and conduct cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges. We have welcomed, are welcoming, and will welcome them in the future on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. One is opposition, and the other is welcome, both for the sake of China's stability, development, and prosperity. The facts from the turmoil to the counterrevolutionary rebellion show that losing vigilance against the plots of peaceful evolution will inevitably interfere with and disrupt the opening up to the outside world; while doing a good job in education and work to prevent peaceful evolution, the opening up to the outside world will definitely develop healthily on the correct track.

Some comrades think that the reason for the emergence of corruption, the spread of bourgeois liberalization, and the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion is that reform and opening up have been pushed too hard—too fast. This idea is wrong. In recent years, from the aspects of reform and opening up and the struggle against economic crimes and ideological and political work, it is indeed one hand being relatively hard and the other hand being relatively soft. But the so-called one hard and one soft is only relative, not that reform and opening up has already been grasped enough. It should be said that reform and opening up is still not enough. Take the reform of the economic system, for example. The old, closed, and rigid system has not been completely broken, and the new mechanism of a socialist commodity economy full of vitality and vitality has not yet been formed. Take political system reform, for example. What has been done is only preliminary, and it will take long-term and arduous efforts to build socialist democratic politics. The tasks proposed by the Thirteenth Congress still need to be gradually completed. Take opening up to the outside world, for example. Although we have introduced a lot of capital, technology, equipment, and advanced management experience in recent years, it is still far from enough for our modernization construction. Therefore, reform and opening up cannot stagnate at the current level, but must be further deepened and expanded. With reform and opening up, there will inevitably be many bad influences from the West. We must pay high attention to this and deal with it seriously, but we must not go back to the old, closed, and rigid path. To deal with bourgeois liberalization and various negative and corrupt phenomena, we must rely on strengthening the education of the Four Cardinal Principles, strengthening ideological and political work, and severely cracking down on economic crimes to overcome them, rather than weakening reform and opening up. The correct policy to solve the problem of one hand being hard and the other hand being soft and not matching well is not to soften or stop the relatively hard hand to match the soft hand, but to actively work hard to make the soft hand hard, and at the same time, to continue to make the relatively hard hand harder, so that the two hands match at a higher level. This is our goal, and all Party comrades should strive to achieve this goal.

Adhering to the general policy of reform and opening up does not mean that all existing specific policies, measures, methods, and steps of reform and opening up will remain unchanged. Of course not. Adhering to the general policy of reform and opening up does not mean that specific policies, measures, methods, and steps of reform and opening up cannot have any changes; changes in specific policies, measures, methods, and steps of reform and opening up do not mean that the general policy of reform and opening up has changed. In fact, adjustments to specific measures and methods are precisely to better adhere to the general policy of reform and opening up. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to implement the policy of rectification and deepening reform, the country has taken some new measures, including seriously implementing the measures that have already been proposed, all for the purpose of ensuring the sustained and stable development of the economy and creating a better environment for reform and opening up. For example, in terms of investment direction and the direction of fund use, according to the principle of strengthening basic industries and agriculture, appropriate tilting is implemented. Again, for those township enterprises that waste electricity and raw materials, appropriate adjustments should be made. Furthermore, in terms of foreign trade, the import of luxury cars and high-end household appliances should be restricted. The implementation of these specific policies, measures, methods, and steps, how can it mean that the general policy of reform and opening up will change? It should be pointed out that the so-called general policy of reform and opening up will not change, which itself contains the variability of specific policies, measures, methods, and steps. The variability of specific policies is an inherent part of the general policy not changing. Reform and opening up have no precedent. If, after being tested by practice, some specific policies, measures, methods, and steps are not very successful or even very unsuccessful, they are still not changed, then the implementation of the general policy will not only be of no help but also harmful. Of course, when adjusting or changing certain specific policies, measures, methods, and steps, we must consider them carefully and be very cautious, adhere to the overall situation, and never because of one mistake, have an adverse effect on the overall situation of reform and opening up.

Adhering to the general policy of reform and opening up cannot be without organizational guarantees. The most important of these is the guarantee of the Party Central Committee's leadership core. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee elected a new leadership body with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The whole Party and the people of the whole country see that this is a team that adheres to the Party's basic line and a team that embodies China's future. After the new central leadership body was formed, the practical things it did made people more convinced that this is a strong core that can lead us to adhere to the foundation of the state and advance steadily and victoriously along the path of reform and opening up to national strength.

Over the past three months, the basic fact on the land of China is that the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the people of China, has been steadfastly adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, resolutely stopping the turmoil and thoroughly suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion, while at the same time, steadily advancing the cause of reform and opening up. Anyone at home and abroad who does not have prejudice will see this. After calm and objective observation, now, those who have doubts in the international community are having their doubts dispelled; those who have concerns are gradually having their concerns removed; more and more people are regaining confidence in China's reform and opening up and modernization cause, actively supporting it, and sincerely cooperating with it. Perhaps some people still want to wait and see. Well, let them wait and see. Facts speak louder than words.

### 改革开放的总方针不会改变

    改革开放的总方针不会改变
    北京发生的反革命暴乱被平息以后，中国的大政方针、基本走向会不会发生什么大变化？全国人民非常关心，国际舆论猜测纷纭。其中，议论的焦点是，改革开放的总方针会不会改变？至今，议论仍没有平息，因此有必要就这个问题阐明我们的观点。
    邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话中鲜明地指出，党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”没有错。要照样干下去，坚定不移地干下去。要使“我们改革开放的步子迈得更稳、更好，甚至于更快。”党的十三届四中全会也郑重宣告：“四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇、始终一贯地加以坚持；改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。”三个多月来，在党和国家领导人的多次讲话中，在我国的一切对外活动中，都反复申明了这个立场。
    说改革开放的总方针不会改变，这是由两个基本的因素所决定的。首先，实行改革开放的总方针，是我国社会主义发展的必然趋势，是进一步解放生产力、发展生产力的客观要求。社会主义制度是人类历史上迄今为止最先进的社会制度。但是，如果不打破封闭状态，不改革僵化的模式，就不能迅速发展生产力，不能充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性。在世界经济、科技迅速发展的今天，不改革开放，中国在世界上就难以有立足之地。其次，这种客观要求已经为我国绝大多数人所认识。党的十一届三中全会以后，一搞改革开放，经济的发展、国力的增强、人民生活水平的提高以及其他各方面的进步，都比过去快得多了。历史是最好的老师。今昔相比，使人们确信欲使中华民族繁荣强盛，舍改革开放别无他途。如果说，十一届三中全会前后那个时期，“中国必须改革开放”还只是少数人的认识的话，那么，经过10年实践的教育，“中国必须改革开放”已经成为11亿人的共识，变成了人民群众共同的实践、共同的要求。改革开放适乎时代之潮流，合乎人群之需要，不是谁想改变就能改变得了的。为了在本世纪末实现小康，为了在下个世纪中叶达到中等发达国家的水平，为了在激烈的国际竞争中迎头赶上，必须更加大胆地改革，更加大胆地开放。强调改革开放的总方针要继续坚定不移地贯彻执行，正是反映了社会发展的客观规律，反映了人民群众的根本利益。
    “现在大讲坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，缺少改革开放的氛围，怎么能保证改革开放的方针不变呢？”这是国内外的某些人士对我们实行改革开放产生怀疑的一个重要原因。其实这是一种极大的误解。四项基本原则与改革开放相互贯通，相互依存，统一于建设有中国特色的社会主义的实践。我们所说的改革开放，是在坚持四项基本原则基础上的改革开放。可几年来有的人却以资产阶级自由化的观点看待改革开放，反对坚持四项基本原则。他们所说的“改革”，实际上是要改到资本主义去；他们所说的“开放”，实际上是要使我国变成帝国主义的附庸国。这种所谓的“改革开放”与我们所说的完全是两码事。可见，在改革开放的问题上，有两种根本不同的思路，两种截然不同的观点。从我们的思路和观点来看，四个坚持与改革开放这两个基本点缺一不可，哪一个方面都不应该削弱。根据近几年对四个坚持抓得不够、反对资产阶级自由化不得力的实际，强调要认真抓起来并持之以恒是十分必要的，这只会为改革开放打下更牢固的基础，提供更有力的保证，而绝不会妨碍改革开放。
    “现在不是大讲要防止和平演变吗？那还讲什么坚持对外开放？”这是把两个问题混淆了。不错，我们对国外敌对势力在中国搞和平演变的阴谋必须保持警惕，随时识破和粉碎他们在这方面的一切罪恶企图。与此同时，我们要一如既往，在和平共处五项原则的基础上同一切国家和地区发展关系；继续实行开放政策，把国外的资金、技术、先进的管理经验等吸收进来，为我所用，加速我们国家的现代化进程，这是坚定不移的。我们决不会因噎废食。坚持既定的基本的经济政治制度与追求经济、科技、文化事业的迅速发展，是一个事情的两个方面。对于国外的某些政治势力要在中国搞和平演变，我们坚决反对；对于各国政府和众多的实业家要同中国做买卖，进行文化科学技术交流，我们过去、现在、将来都热烈欢迎，愿意在平等互利的基础上增进往来。一个是反对，一个是欢迎，目的都是为了中国的稳定、发展、繁荣。从动乱到暴乱的事实说明，对和平演变的阴谋丧失警惕，必然干扰、破坏对外开放；而把防止和平演变这方面的教育和工作做好了，对外开放一定会在正确的轨道上健康地发展下去。
    还有的同志认为，之所以会出现腐败现象，出现资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，出现动乱和反革命暴乱，是改革开放抓得太硬——搞得有点过快了，因此希望改革开放的步子放慢一些。这种想法是不对的。近几年来，从改革开放和打击经济犯罪、思想政治工作两个方面来看，的确是一手比较硬，一手比较软。但所谓一硬一软只是相对而言，绝不是说改革开放就已经抓得很够了。应当说，改革开放得还不够。拿经济体制的改革来说，封闭僵化的旧体制尚未完全打破，充满生机和活力的社会主义商品经济的新机制也还远未形成。拿政治体制改革来说，已经做的还只是初步的，要建设社会主义民主政治还要做长期艰苦的努力，十三大提出的各项任务还有待逐步完成。拿对外开放来说，这些年虽然引进了不少资金、技术、设备和先进的管理经验，但是对于我们的现代化建设来说还很不够。因此，改革开放不能在现有水平上踏步，而是必须进一步深化、拓展。随着改革开放必然会有西方的许多坏的影响进来，对此，我们必须高度重视，认真对待，但决不能重新回到封闭僵化的老路上去。对付资产阶级自由化和种种消极腐败现象，要靠加强四项基本原则的教育、加强思想政治工作、严厉打击经济犯罪等来克服，而不能弱化改革开放。解决一硬一软不相称、配合得不好这个问题的正确方针，不是使比较硬的一手软下来或停下来，使之与软的一手相称，而是一方面积极努力，使软的一手硬起来，另一方面再接再厉，使比较硬的一手更硬一些，使两手抓在更高的水平上相称起来。这是我们的目标，全党同志要努力去实现这个目标。
    坚持改革开放的总方针不变，是不是一切现行的改革开放的具体政策、措施、方法、步骤也都一成不变呢？当然不是。坚持改革开放的总方针，不等于改革开放的具体政策、措施、方法、步骤不能有任何变化；改革开放的具体政策、措施、方法、步骤有了某些调整，也不等于改革开放的总方针就变了。实际上，具体措施、方法的一些调整，正是为了更好地坚持改革开放的总方针。党的十三届三中全会以来，为贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针，国家采取了一些新的措施，包括认真落实原来已经提出来的措施，都是为了保证经济持续稳定发展，为改革开放创造更好的环境。例如，在投资方向、资金使用方向上，根据加强基础工业和农业的原则，实行适当的倾斜。又如，对那些浪费电力和原材料的乡镇企业，要适当进行调整。再如，在对外贸易方面，要限制进口小轿车、高档家用电器等。这些具体政策、措施、方法、步骤的实施，怎么会意味着要改变改革开放的总方针呢？应当指出，所谓改革开放的总方针不变，本身已经包容了具体政策、措施、方法、步骤的可变性。具体政策可变是总方针不变的题中应有之义。改革开放前无古人，如果经过实践检验，某些具体政策、措施、方法、步骤不很成功甚至很不成功，仍然不加改变，那么对总方针的贯彻不但无补，而且有害。当然，在对某些具体政策、措施、方法、步骤进行调整或改变时，不能操切从事，必须周密考虑、十分慎重，坚持从大局着眼，千万不要因为一着不慎，对改革开放的大局造成不利的影响。
    坚持改革开放的总方针，不能没有组织上的保证。而最重要的，是党中央领导核心的保证。党的十三届四中全会选举产生了以江泽民同志为核心的新的领导机构，全党和全国人民看到这是一个坚持党的基本路线的班子，是一个体现中国前途的班子。新的中央领导机构产生以后所办的实事，使人们更加确信，这是一个能够领导我们坚持立国之本、沿着改革开放的强国之路扎扎实实胜利前进的、完全可以信赖的坚强核心。
    近三个多月来，中国大地上所发生的基本事实是，中国共产党领导中国人民在旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，坚决制止动乱、彻底平息反革命暴乱的同时，正在坚定不移地把改革开放的事业继续推向前进。国内外任何一个不抱偏见的人士都会看到这一点。经过冷静地客观地观察，现在，国际上那些有怀疑的人，怀疑正在打消；有顾虑的人，顾虑逐步解除；越来越多的人对我国的改革开放和现代化事业重建信心，积极支持，真诚合作。也许，有些人士还想再等一等，看一看。那么，好吧，就请他们再看一看吧。事实毕竟胜于雄辩。
