The Burma Road, famous both domestically and internationally, is the essential route for the eight prefectures and districts of western Yunnan to reach the provincial capital, Kunming. It is also the sole land transportation route for Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Tibet to engage in international trade with some Southeast Asian countries. In recent years, the traffic density on the Burma Road has increased, exceeding the designed traffic capacity by 5 to 8 times, and is already in a state of overloaded tension. However, on this road, there are phenomena such as using the road as a market, obstructing traffic; excavating mountains, blasting rocks, and piling up debris, damaging the road; and using vehicles for personal gain, violating laws and discipline, which are becoming increasingly prominent.

The 876-kilometer road from Kunming to the China-Myanmar border has more than 50 large and small markets along it, with markets every day. Whenever there is a market day, the 5 to 7-meter-wide road is filled with stalls and goods, with pedestrians, cars, tractors, bicycles, horse-drawn carts, and rickshaws all moving about, causing some sections to be completely congested, with traffic jams lasting for several hours, leading to frequent traffic accidents.

The section of the road from the gate of the Baoshan New China Factory to the Forestry Hotel, stretching over 400 meters, is the largest vegetable market in the Baoshan area. Every day before dawn, vehicles carrying vegetables, such as bicycles, carts, horse-drawn carts, tractors, and cars, rush here to park, with vegetables everywhere, and farmers' cries and buyers' arguments echoing. The 7-meter-wide road is occupied by 3 meters of vegetable stalls, and vehicles passing through here can only travel at a speed of less than 10 kilometers per hour, with traffic jams occurring several times a day. I once asked a farmer, "Why do you occupy the road to sell vegetables instead of going to the city market?" He replied, "It's quicker to sell here." The vegetable vendors here buy large quantities of vegetables and transport them to nearby counties and districts for resale.

The problem of excavating mountains, blasting rocks, and various debris damaging the road is also very prominent. There are more than 100 places along the Burma Road where mountains are excavated and rocks are blasted. Whenever mountains are excavated and rocks are blasted, stones and mud roll down, burying the roadside ditches, and sometimes stones are blasted onto the road, creating pits, severely damaging the road, and affecting driving safety. There are also more than 100 mountain roads opened along the roadside for transporting stone materials. During the rainy season, the mud and sand washed down from these mountain roads silt up the roadside ditches, erode the road shoulders, and cause the road surface to lose all its sand and gravel, resulting in widespread "slippery roads." In addition, many sections have sand, gravel, garbage, and farmyard manure piled up on the road shoulders and ditches. Some are piled up on both sides of the road, leaving only a single lane for vehicles. Road maintenance workers can only clear it themselves after failing to persuade, but new piles appear overnight.

There are more than 4,000 restaurants, inns, and small shops along the Burma Road, and this number is still increasing. Almost all these shops occupy the roadside ditches and shoulders, and also dump sewage and pile up debris on the road. As for the road signs, which are crucial for driving safety, having their characters worn off, and the guardrails being pushed over or broken, these are common occurrences. These shops were mostly built in recent years, with most of them being individual businesses. Due to the complexity of the operators and the difficulty for relevant departments to manage, or even the inability to manage, various bad phenomena are rampant, making them places for hiding dirt and filth. The shop owners, on the one hand, make a lot of money from passing travelers, and on the other hand, think of various ways to win over passing drivers, taking advantage of the state. Each shop owner has a group of drivers who come and go frequently. They give the drivers some benefits, such as money, a good meal, a few good cigarettes, or a couple of good bottles of liquor, and the drivers will violate the transportation regulations and generously unload some scarce materials, such as gasoline, rice, coal, and timber. Many restaurants and inns also have girls specifically to serve passing drivers. Some shops have become dens for theft, smuggling, gambling, and prostitution.

### 滇缅公路上问题多

　　滇缅公路上问题多
    闻名中外的滇缅公路，是滇西8地、州通往省会昆明市的必经之路，也是云、贵、川、藏4省区与东南亚一些国家进行国际贸易的唯一的陆上交通要道。近年来，滇缅公路行车密度增加，超过公路设计承受交通量的5至8倍，已处于超负荷的紧张状态。可是在这条路上，以路为市，妨碍交通；开山炸石、堆集杂物，损路蚀路；以车谋私、违法乱纪等现象也日益突出。
    由昆明至中缅边境876公里的公路沿线，有大小集市50多个，天天有集。每逢赶集，5至7米宽的公路上，摆满了摊子、货担子，行人、汽车、拖拉机、自行车、马车和人力车你来我往，挤得有些地段水泄不通，一堵就是几小时，致使交通事故时有发生。
    保山新华工厂门口至林业旅社长达400多米的公路上，是保山地区最大的菜市。每天天不亮，运菜的自行车、板车、马车、拖拉机、汽车便涌到这里停放，遍地是菜，前堆后挤，菜农的叫卖声、买主的吵嚷声此起彼伏。7米宽的公路，被菜摊侵占了3米，行车至此，车速每小时不足10公里，每天堵几次车。我曾问一个菜农：“为什么抢占公路摆菜摊，而不到城里的菜市销售？”他说：“这里脱手快。”菜贩子们在这儿大量收购蔬菜，运到邻近地、州、县贩卖。
    开山炸石和各种杂物损路的问题也非常突出。滇缅公路沿线开山炸石有100多处。每逢开山炸石时，山石泥沙滚滚而下，埋没公路边沟，有时石头被炸飞到公路上，地上砸出一个个坑，严重破坏公路，影响行车安全。公路旁还开辟有上百条专运石料的山路，雨季顺山路冲下来的泥沙淤塞公路边沟，冲毁路肩，使路面沙料全部流失，造成普遍“路滑”。此外，不少地段在路肩、边沟处堆放砂石、垃圾、农家肥，有的堆在公路两侧，把路面挤得只剩一条单车道。养路工劝阻无效，只得自己动手清理，然而隔夜又有新堆出现。
  滇缅公路沿线现有4000多家饭店、旅店、小卖铺，目前还有继续增长的趋势。绝大多数店铺都侵占公路边沟、路肩，还在路上倒污水、堆杂物。至于对行车安全至关重要的路况标志牌被磨掉字样，护栏被推倒、打断，也是司空见惯的。这些店铺都是近几年兴建起来的，以个体户为多。由于经营人员复杂，有关部门管理难度大，甚至无法管理，无人管理，使种种不良现象日益泛滥，成了藏污纳垢之地。店铺老板们一方面大赚过往旅客的钱，一方面想方设法笼络过往司机，占国家便宜。每个店铺的老板，无不结识着一批常来常往的司机，他们给司机一些好处，如一笔钱、一顿好饭、几条好烟或两瓶好酒，司机便违反承运规章，慷慨地卸下一些紧俏物资，如汽油、大米、煤、木料等。不少饭馆、旅店还有姑娘专门接待过往司机。有的店铺成了偷窃、倒卖、聚赌、卖淫的窝点。
