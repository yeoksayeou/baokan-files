Kehai Group Introduces "Two-Dimensional Three-Code" Method

	BEIJING — Beijing Kehai High-Tech (Group) Company recently launched a new computer Chinese character input method called the "Two-Dimensional Three-Code" method. This input method uses only twenty-seven basic keys on the keyboard, reducing the maximum code length for each Chinese character from four codes to three, and maintaining a dynamic homophone rate of less than one per thousand.

	Another notable advantage of this input method is its ability to input both simplified and traditional Chinese characters simultaneously, with identical input rules. The rules are simple and easy to learn, allowing beginners to master them in just a few minutes.

    科海集团推出“二维三码”法
    本报讯　北京科海高技术（集团）公司近日推出一种新的计算机汉字输入法——“二维三码”法。这种输入法在键盘上仅用二十七个基本键位，每个汉字码的最大码长由四码压缩为三码，且动态重码率低于千分之一。
    这种输入法的另一个显著优点，是可以同时输入简体字与繁体字，输入规则完全相同。其规则简单易学，初学者几分钟即能掌握。
