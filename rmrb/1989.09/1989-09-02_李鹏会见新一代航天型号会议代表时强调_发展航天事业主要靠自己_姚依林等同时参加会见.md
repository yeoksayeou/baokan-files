The sun was shining brightly in Zhongnanhai, and applause echoed in front of Ziguangge. At around 8 a.m. on September 2, Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with representatives attending the conference on the development of new-generation aerospace projects and took a group photo.

Li Peng and Yao Yilin warmly shook hands with the representatives. Premier Li Peng said, "On behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I extend cordial greetings to all the military personnel, engineering and technical personnel, and workers on the rocket and missile frontline."

Li Peng said, "Our aerospace industry was initiated by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, including Premier Zhou Enlai, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, and the older generation of experts. Many of the comrades present today have also made significant contributions to this cause."

Li Peng emphasized, "Our achievements in the aerospace industry are basically the result of self-reliance and arduous struggle. Of course, during the past decade of reform and opening up, we have also learned some advanced technologies from abroad. However, for such cutting-edge technologies and defense sciences, practice has proven that we can only obtain certain partial technologies from abroad, but the overall technology and the entire system engineering must rely on ourselves. We must follow the path of self-reliance. Li Peng said, "Especially after the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, our minds have become even clearer. Therefore, in the future, whether for national defense or for civilian use, we must mainly rely on self-reliance and arduous struggle. I hope everyone will continue to work hard, as the task is heavy and the road is long. I wish you success."

Those who accompanied the meeting included Vice Secretaries of the Central Military Commission Hong Xuezhi and Liu Huaqing, State Councilor Song Jian, and relevant department heads Luo Gan, Ding Henggao, and Lin Zongtang.

    李鹏会见新一代航天型号会议代表时强调
    发展航天事业主要靠自己
    姚依林等同时参加会见
    据新华社北京9月2日电　（记者徐耀中）中南海里阳光明媚，紫光阁前掌声阵阵。9月2日上午8时许，国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林与出席新一代航天型号研制工作会议的代表会见并合影留念。
    李鹏、姚依林高兴地同代表们握手问好。李鹏总理说，我代表党中央、国务院和中央军委，向工作在火箭导弹战线上的全体解放军指战员、工程技术人员和全体职工致以亲切的问候。李鹏说，我国的航天事业是老一辈无产阶级革命家周恩来总理、聂荣臻元帅、老一代专家们开创的。今天在坐的许多同志也为此作出了贡献。
    李鹏强调说，我国在航天事业上的成就基本上是靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗取得的。当然在改革开放的十年中也汲取了一些国外的先进技术，但是属于这种尖端技术、国防科学技术，实践证明，我们只可能从国外得到某些局部的技术，但总体技术，整个的系统工程必须依靠我们自己，必须走自力更生的道路。李鹏说，特别是这次北京发生反革命暴乱事件以后，我们的头脑更加清醒了。所以我们今后发展航天事业，一为国防，二为民用，都主要靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗。希望大家继续努力，任重道远，祝你们成功。
    陪同会见的还有中央军委副秘书长洪学智、刘华清，国务委员宋健和有关部门负责人罗干、丁衡高、林宗棠等。
