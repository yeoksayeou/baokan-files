    The Importance of High-Level Highway Construction
    Senior Economist, China International Engineering Consulting Company, Zhou Ming

    To change the backward state of road transportation in China, it is necessary and feasible to gradually build some high-level highways in economically developed regions and on busy national highways with heavy traffic.

    In recent years, I have come into contact with several feasibility studies for high-level highways and participated in the evaluation of a few high-level highways. From the materials I have seen, the social and economic benefits of high-level highways are significant, and the financial benefits of toll roads are also very good. For example, the route from Hangzhou to Ningbo currently has a second-class highway, which is 246 kilometers long and passes through five cities and counties, including Shaoxing, and 15 towns where township enterprises are developed. Due to the rapid increase in traffic volume and the mixing of various non-motorized vehicles on the road, the road is congested, traffic is jammed, and accidents are frequent. The average speed is only 35 kilometers per hour, meaning it takes 7 hours to travel from Hangzhou to Ningbo, which does not meet the requirements for passenger and cargo transportation. Therefore, Zhejiang Province has proposed building a high-speed highway and conducted a feasibility study. The proposed high-speed highway is 170 kilometers long, reducing the distance by more than 70 kilometers compared to the existing highway. The design speed is 120 kilometers per hour. After the highway is completed, if the speed is 85 kilometers per hour, it will take only two hours to travel from Hangzhou to the end point of Ningbo, Da Shi Qi. This is a significant reduction compared to the 7 hours required on the existing highway and the approximately 6 hours required by the ordinary passenger train (there is no express train on this section). This reduces the time for transporting passengers and goods, speeds up vehicle turnover, saves energy, reduces vehicle wear and tear and traffic accidents, thereby lowering transportation costs and improving passenger comfort. The social and economic benefits are very significant. This highway will recover its investment in just 11 years from the start of construction.

    Since this highway is built with loans, tolls are needed to repay the loans, so a financial benefit analysis was conducted. The financial benefits are calculated based on the total investment, loan interest, operating and maintenance costs, and the tolls collected. To balance the interests of both investors and users, the tolls are collected at 30% of the direct benefits of reducing the transportation distance by 70 kilometers compared to the existing highway. For example, small passenger cars are charged 0.075 yuan per kilometer, and medium-sized trucks are charged 0.129 yuan per kilometer. Compared to the toll standards already implemented abroad, this is relatively low and easy for users to accept. According to the financial benefit analysis based on the above toll standards, the loan principal and interest can be repaid in 20 years from the start of investment. If calculated from the completion and operation of the highway, it will take only 16 years to repay the loan.

    要重视高等级公路建设
    中国国际工程咨询公司高级经济师　周明
    为改变我国公路交通的落后局面，在经济发达地区、在运输繁忙、交通量大的国道上逐步建设一些高等级公路是必要的，也是可能的。
    近年来，我接触到一些高等级公路可行性研究报告，并参与了少数高等级公路的评估工作。从我接触到的上述材料看，高等级公路的社会经济效益是显著的，收费公路的财务效益也是很好的。如杭州到宁波，现有一条二级公路，全长246公里，全线穿越绍兴等5个市、县城区和15个乡镇企业发达的集镇，由于交通量增长快，加上各种非机动车辆在路上混合行驶，致使道路拥挤，交通堵塞，事故频繁，平均时速只有35公里，也就是说，杭州到宁波需要7个小时行程，满足不了客、货运输要求。为此，浙江省提出修建一条高速公路，并作了可行性研究。拟修建的高速公路全长170公里，比现有公路里程缩短70余公里。设计时速120公里。公路建成后，从杭州到终点宁波大石契，若按时速85公里计算，只需两小时即可到达，比现有公路需7小时和铁路普客列车（这一段没有快车）约需6个小时运行时间，都缩短很多。这就减少客、货运送时间，加速车辆周转，节省能源，减少车辆损耗和交通事故，从而降低了运输成本并提高了旅客的舒适性，社会经济效益是十分显著的。这条公路从投资建设开始计算，只需11年的时间即可全部收回投资。
    由于这条公路是贷款建设，需要收过路费偿还，因此作了财务效益分析。财务效益是根据总投资额、贷款利息、运营管理及大修费用与收取的过路费测算的。为兼顾投资者与使用者双方利益，过路费是按照比现有公路缩短运输里程70公里直接收益的30％收取的，如小客车每车公里只收0.075元，中型货车0.129元，这与国外已实施的收费标准相比是较低的，易于被使用者接受。按照上述收费标准测算的财务效益分析结果，从投资开始计算，20年即可还清贷款本息。如从建成投入运营后计算，只要16年就还清了。
