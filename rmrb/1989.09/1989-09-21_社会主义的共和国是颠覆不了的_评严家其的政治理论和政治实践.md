The Socialist Republic Cannot Be Overthrown – A Critique of Yan Jiaqi's Political Theory and Practice

A "Theoretical Basis" for Overthrowing the People's Republic of China

In July 1989, Yan Jiaqi, who had fled abroad, published an article titled "China Is Not a 'Republic'." In the article, he claimed that the People's Republic of China is not a republic but rather an "empire" that practices "despotic rule." Previously, in the "May 17 Declaration," he also proclaimed that the government of the People's Republic of China "is not a government of a republic."

In fact, Yan Jiaqi had long held this view. In 1980, Yan Jiaqi published two articles consecutively: one titled "The Theory of Dynasty Cycles" and the other "The Imperial Seal Hidden in the Republic." In these articles, he argued that China's history of several thousand years has been in a cycle of "dynasty changes." The victory of the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of China has given "new content" to this "ancient historical cycle" in the 20th century. This means that although there is new content, it is still within the range of the dynasty cycle. At that time, for the sake of self-concealment, Yan Jiaqi expressed his idea that "China is not a republic" in a more obscure manner. He said that there are many "imperial seals" hidden in our "People's Republic." If these imperial seals are removed, China will become a "genuine socialist republic." Although he used such a roundabout writing style, the idea that "China is not a republic" was still expressed very clearly. Afterward, Yan Jiaqi has repeatedly expressed similar views. His other topics or ideas, such as separation of powers, term limits, and procedural politics, are also largely related to this view.

Yan Jiaqi's main arguments for this proposition are fourfold.

First, "All victorious peasant wars have established new dynasties, and no peasant war in Chinese history has deviated from this historical law." "The armed struggle of the Communist Party of China is essentially a peasant revolution, a peasant war." Therefore, "according to the inherent traditions of China's historical development, this victorious peasant war should establish a new and powerful dynasty in China." Even if the appearance of the Communist Party of China has given history "new content," it still cannot escape the "ancient historical cycle."

Second, "The highest power of the state is ultimately concentrated in the hands of one person, and no one or any institution is allowed to divide it," and there is no separation of powers.

Third, "The highest power concentrated in the hands of an individual is not transferable," that is, the de facto lifetime tenure of the highest position.

Fourth, "The succession of the highest power is non-procedural," and the succession of the highest power either changes with the will of the individual who originally held the highest power or changes with the outcome of political struggles over the seizure of the highest power. In either case, there is no procedure.

In the current social consciousness where people have long detested imperial rule and the idea of a republic has deeply penetrated people's minds, declaring the political system of the People's Republic of China to be "imperial rule" is tantamount to declaring it to be the object of revolution. Since it is imperial rule and not a republic, it is natural that it should be overthrown. Overthrowing an empire is not only not reactionary, not counter-revolutionary, but is progressive and revolutionary. Thus, through Yan Jiaqi's "proof," overthrowing the People's Republic of China has become a reasonable thing.

Obviously, "China is not a republic but an empire" is a "theoretical basis" manufactured by Yan Jiaqi to overthrow the People's Republic of China, and it is also a major "theoretical basis" he provided for the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion.

"The Theory of Despotic Rule" is a Complete Distortion

The proposition that Yan Jiaqi put forward, "The political system of the People's Republic of China is a despotic system," does not conform to the facts.

First, the assertion that the armed struggle of the Communist Party of China is essentially a peasant war is a proposition put forward by Mao Zedong in a specific sense. This specific meaning is: the main body of the armed struggle is the peasants, its forward base is mainly in the countryside, and its tasks to be completed include the land revolution. Even if this peasant war is viewed in this specific sense, it is absolutely impossible to lead to the establishment of a new dynasty. Because the historical environment in which this peasant war took place is completely different from that of the past. The era in which this peasant war occurred is a time when human society has entered the stage of mechanized socialized production, and capitalist production relations and commodity exchange relations are increasingly expanding to all parts of the world, including the Chinese mainland. In this era, peasant revolutions either become allies of the bourgeois revolution or allies of the proletarian revolution. Therefore, peasant wars either lead to the establishment of a bourgeois republic or a proletarian republic, and will never lead to the establishment of a feudal despotic dynasty. Under the conditions of the development of commodity exchange relations, the spontaneous tendency of peasants is mainly capitalist, not feudal. At this time, feudal relations and ideas can only exist as residues or influences, and will not become the dominant things in the country. They do not have the power to create a new feudal dynasty. Because of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, this contemporary peasant war can powerfully transcend the limitations of the peasants themselves and become a thorough anti-feudal new democratic revolutionary war, through the land revolution, eliminating the landlord class and the tenant economy, and uprooting the class and economic basis on which the feudal dynasty relies. After the new democratic revolution, our socialist revolution has further cleared the way for socialized production and the commodity economy, further eliminating the possibility of the emergence of imperial rule. This fact is something that no historical twists and turns can cover up.

Second, the highest power of our country is not concentrated in the hands of one person. Within the ruling party, the highest power is exercised by the National Congress, and during its recess, it is exercised by the Central Committee. Daily affairs are handled by the Political Bureau. The party committee collectively decides on major matters, and in making decisions, the minority is subject to the majority. The convener of the committee, that is, the secretary, has only one vote. The highest power of the state is exercised by the National People's Congress, and during its recess, it is exercised by its Standing Committee.

In the past, within the ruling party, some leaders, due to their outstanding level, ability, experience, and prestige, had a great influence and even control over the highest decision-making body. This concentration of power in individuals has not become an institution. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to correct the phenomenon of power being too concentrated in the hands of certain individuals in actual operation, our party has further strengthened and improved the collective leadership system of the party committee.

Third, our country has never had a lifetime tenure for the highest position. Whether it is the ruling party or the state power organs, the highest positions are all elected. The change of persons holding the highest positions due to various reasons is also a common occurrence. In our state power organs and ruling party, there have been phenomena where some top leaders, due to being the choice of the people, have been re-elected and even died in office, but this has not formed a system of lifetime tenure for leadership positions. To prevent citizens from holding the highest leadership position for life, in 1982, our country stipulated in the new constitution that the head of state and the head of government "shall not serve more than two consecutive terms." In the Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the elderly revolutionary leaders of the older generation voluntarily retired from the front line of leadership, using their actions to solve the problem of leaders who are the choice of the people holding the highest positions in the party for life.

Fourth, the transfer or succession of the highest power in our country is procedural. The procedures for the production, transfer, and operation of the highest power of the state are clearly recorded in the constitution and the law on the organization of state organs. The procedures for the production, transfer, and operation of the highest power of the ruling party are clearly recorded in the party constitution. Of course, when the highest power is produced and transferred, there is no strict procedure for the preparation of institutions and personnel. However, this is the case in all countries and parties today. If strict procedures are required for pre-meeting and post-meeting preparations, then there is no such "procedural politics" in the world. The adaptation of original procedures due to changes in circumstances is also a common feature of all procedures. To claim that the exercise and succession of the highest power in our country have no procedures, on the grounds that there are different opinions and disputes surrounding the composition of the highest power, is completely unreasonable.

Of course, due to historical reasons, our political system is not perfect. For this reason, we need to reform it. In fact, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we are gradually reforming the political system. This reform belongs to the self-improvement of the people's republic, not a fundamental transformation of the so-called "despotic system." Yan Jiaqi's characterization of China's political system as a despotic system, as an imperial system, is a complete distortion of the political system of the People's Republic of China.

The Purpose is to Establish a Bourgeois Political System

Yan Jiaqi insists that the People's Republic of China is not a republic but an empire. Is this just to raise his own fame by making shocking statements? No. In his book "State System," Yan Jiaqi has long determined that whether it is a slave-owning state, a landlord state, or a capitalist state, there are two different systems: monarchy and republic. In these two forms of the state, different class contents can exist. Since this is the case, the purpose of Yan Jiaqi's extensive discussion of the issues of imperial rule and republicanism is obviously to avoid the issue of the class nature of the state, in order to conveniently smuggle in the bourgeois political system under the cover of the issue of the system.

What does Yan Jiaqi's ideal political system look like? From his statements, it roughly includes the following contents.

First, the separation of powers, that is, the legislative power, executive power, and judicial power are independent, equal, and mutually check and balance each other. The country that practices the separation of powers most typically in the world is the United States. Therefore, Yan Jiaqi actually wants to establish an American-style political system in China. Yan Jiaqi's proposal for the separation of powers is a direct negation of our people's congress system. Because according to the people's congress system, our legislative organ, the National People's Congress, is the sole highest state power organ. The executive and judicial organs' powers are neither independent nor parallel to the legislative organ's powers and cannot counterbalance the legislative organ's powers. Under the current historical conditions of our country, the unitary system of the highest state power is conducive to maintaining the unity and efficiency of state organs and is an effective form of state organ organization that our people have explored in the process of building socialism. In addition, Yan Jiaqi believes that "in China, before discussing the separation of powers, the problem of separating party and government must be solved first." The "separation of party and government" he refers to is to abolish the so-called "government" above the "government," that is, to exclude the leadership of the Communist Party over state organs. Therefore, the prerequisite for the separation of powers he proposes is to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party.

Second, political pluralism. According to reports, "According to Yan Jiaqi's explanation, the meaning of political pluralism is that people enjoy the full freedom of association granted by law, and people have the freedom to independently establish various organizations according to the association law." Its actual content is to make organizations such as the "High Autonomy Federation" and the "Democratic China Front," which take the creation of turmoil as their purpose and the overthrow of the legitimate government of China as their goal, gain legal status in China to "compete with the Communist Party." Under the current conditions in China, proposing political pluralism is a strategy to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and is a transitional slogan to attempt to make China evolve into a one-party dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Third, a constitution that guarantees private property rights. In November 1988, Yan Jiaqi proposed that "the primary issue of China's political reform in the 1990s is to amend the constitution," to "clearly stipulate the protection of private property rights in the constitution." Why does Yan Jiaqi want to guarantee private property rights? He said: "Only the guarantee of property can guarantee the existence of freedoms such as freedom of speech, publication, and association. Revising the constitution to guarantee the existence of private property rights." Since the socialist public ownership system is the guarantee for the realization of the freedoms of speech, publication, association, etc. of the proletariat, then private ownership is naturally the guarantee for the realization of the freedoms of speech, publication, association, etc. of the bourgeoisie.

The important role of guaranteeing private property rights is actually to create conditions for the rise of the "middle class" in socialist China. Yan Jiaqi and his group understand that without this "middle class" (the middle class in their minds actually refers to the middle bourgeoisie), the bourgeois political system they want to establish will not have a solid, reliable, and stable class foundation, and even if it is established, it will not be able to stand firmly. Yan Jiaqi's accomplice Wan Runnan said: "The rise of the middle class is the foundation of a democratic system." Therefore, it is necessary to guarantee private property rights in the form of the constitution.

The establishment of private property rights will also provide an economic basis for "elite politics." In the capitalist world, elites refer to well-educated individuals who, by controlling enterprises, associations, mass media, and thus being able to strongly influence social life, as well as politicians and scholars. Usually, only capitalists and their intellectuals can become such elites. The planners of this turmoil in our country say they want to establish "elite politics" in China, which is to establish a political system in which capitalists and their intellectuals hold power and make decisions. According to their use of the word "elite" and its actual reference, the goal of the "elite politics" they want to achieve is to replace the people's democratic dictatorship with bourgeois dictatorship.

Fourth, federalism. Yan Jiaqi advocates that Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China are all just one state in this federation, and even Tibet should be counted as one state. It is not difficult to see that Yan Jiaqi's advocacy of federalism, on the surface, is for the realization of the unification of Taiwan and the mainland, but in fact, it harbors the intention to split the People's Republic of China.

The political system with the above contents is essentially a bourgeois political system.

Since Yan Jiaqi determines that the People's Republic of China is not a republic but an empire, and since Yan Jiaqi wants to establish a bourgeois political system in China that prioritizes the protection of private property, then how to overthrow the existing government of the People's Republic of China and when to overthrow it, for Yan Jiaqi, is just a matter of method and time.

Under the Banner of Reform to "Erode" and "Transform"

Over the past decade, due to the support and protection of powerful figures within the party who support bourgeois liberalization, Yan Jiaqi's main method of overthrowing the People's Republic of China has been to use the name of democracy and the hand of reform to attempt to transform the socialist political system of people's democratic dictatorship through erosion and substitution.

Since "entering the kingdom of political science," especially after taking charge of the work of the Institute of Political Science of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (until July 1988), Yan Jiaqi has organized and planned to peddle Western bourgeois political ideas. He took advantage of the fact that we had previously taken a detour of replacing political science with general Marxist theory, and in the process of correcting this deviation and restoring the independent status of political science, he led the discipline construction in another direction, that is, abandoning Marxism and starting anew. From his introduction and citation of Western political science, it can be seen that he actually believes that there is not much political science in Marxism, and only in Western bourgeois political science can there be true political science. He repeatedly advocates the idea that Western political culture is a "universal culture that transcends national and ethnic boundaries," in order to make others also boldly accept bourgeois political culture. Under his influence, some people have become active promoters of the bourgeois political system, and some have even become active participants in the turmoil.

In recent years, Yan Jiaqi has taken advantage of the opportunity of political system reform in our country. On the one hand, he peddles the bourgeois political system to our party and government decision-making organs, and on the other hand, he uses public opinion tools to propagate bourgeois political theories, making long-term ideological preparations for the implementation of Western political systems in China.

At the same time, Yan Jiaqi also frequently goes abroad to seek guidance. Because he holds a clear negative attitude towards the current political system of China, admires bourgeois democracy, and vigorously promotes bourgeois political ideas in China; because he was noticed by Zhao Ziyang's secretary Bao Tong and participated in the work of the Central Political System Reform Research Group, having the possibility of influencing the central decision-making through Bao Tong; therefore, he has attracted the attention of capitalist powers such as the United States. In the tacit understanding between the two sides, he has become a chess piece for the United States to implement the strategy of peaceful evolution in socialist China, becoming one of their agents in the Chinese intellectual circle. Under the praise of some people at home and abroad, Yan Jiaqi has become a "theoretical authority on political system reform," a "scholar who throws 'bombs'," a "political elite," a "democratic fighter," and a "world-renowned figure in contemporary times," which can be said to be a time of great fame.

To Seize Power Through Turmoil and Rebellion

Yan Jiaqi's advocacy of bourgeois political ideas and promotion of bourgeois political systems naturally encountered resistance and criticism from Marxists within the party. It was only because of the protection of people like Bao Tong that he was able to pass safely. In the second half of 1988, our country's economy encountered some difficulties, and the mistakes of Comrade Zhao Ziyang were exposed. The dissatisfaction within the party towards Comrade Zhao Ziyang increased. Yan Jiaqi felt that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's position was unstable, and he was afraid that his so-called reform plan would no longer receive support and protection from powerful figures in the party and government decision-making layers, thus producing a sense of crisis. In November 1988, he said that China has "the tendency to change power in a non-procedural manner," and therefore "China is now in a crisis." From then on, Yan Jiaqi changed his tactics and, together with other "elite figures," attempted to take a desperate gamble to achieve their goals, which they found difficult to achieve in a stable environment, by inciting turmoil.

Yan Jiaqi's performance before and during the turmoil is already generally known, and we will not discuss it in detail here. This article only wants to point out the following points.

First, before and during the turmoil, Yan Jiaqi's words and deeds were inconsistent. Before the turmoil, Yan Jiaqi said that difficulties or certain mistakes should not be used as an excuse for power struggles and that the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution should not be repeated. However, when the rioters used the country's difficulties and certain mistakes to force the party and state leaders to hand over power, and adopted methods such as posting big-character posters, parading, and establishing illegal organizations to "repeat the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution," Yan Jiaqi not only praised them but also actively participated. Before the turmoil, Yan Jiaqi had said that "democratic politics" is "procedural politics" and "responsible politics." During the turmoil, the rioters sometimes said they wanted to mourn Hu Yaobang, sometimes said they wanted to dialogue with the central leaders, sometimes rushed the Xinhua Gate, and sometimes illegally paraded and occupied Tiananmen Square. These actions and their transformations had no procedures. The rioters spread rumors, blocked traffic, and disrupted order, inciting the uninformed masses and then claiming that they could not control the situation. None of these were responsible behaviors. Even according to Yan Jiaqi's two definitions of "democratic politics," these were absolutely not "democratic politics." However, Yan Jiaqi maliciously called such non-procedural actions and non-responsible actions "democracy." It can be seen that Yan Jiaqi was not at all seeking democracy but was using "democracy" as a banner to overthrow the legitimate government through turmoil.

Second, Yan Jiaqi used Zhao Ziyang's speech, which shifted the responsibility to Deng Xiaoping, to openly reveal his view that China is a dictatorship. Through the "May 17 Declaration," he announced that the Chinese government "is not a government of a republic, but a government under the dictatorship of one person." This government "is irresponsible and inhumane," and therefore should "bury the dictatorship and bury the imperial system." This is a clear call to the rioters to overthrow the People's Republic of China.

Third, Yan Jiaqi proposed to overthrow Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and Li Peng, and this was not only directed at these individuals but also at the entire Communist Party of China. In late May, Yan Jiaqi told a Hong Kong reporter that "the ruling party is the party that organizes the government, and if it does not gain the trust of the people, it cannot become the ruling party. Now the Communist Party of China faces a great crisis," that is, it does not gain the "trust of the people," and therefore cannot rule. This clearly shows his intention.

Fourth, Yan Jiaqi and his group understand that in the crucial moment of fighting to the death with the Communist Party and the people's government, the general masses they deceived are not reliable, and only various criminal elements, unrehabilitated released prisoners, hooligans, and ruffians who harbor deep hatred towards the Communist Party and the people's government are truly reliable. To maintain the "rational, peaceful, and non-violent" facade of the "political elites" to deceive the world, they urgently need others to do what the "elites" themselves are not convenient to do. In this way, the "elites" and the dregs of society have united under the drive of common interests and common goals, forming an alliance such as the "Capital Federation of Various Circles" and the "Tiananmen Square Command Center." This "Command Center" shouted through loudspeakers: "Workers can take action, citizens can take action, students will not take action, and those who love students should not obstruct citizens (from taking action)," clearly showing their strategy and division of labor. Despite this division of labor, the "High Autonomy Federation" and the "Workers' Autonomy Federation" still jointly distributed weapons such as daggers and iron bars, taught methods of making and using Molotov cocktails and burning military vehicles, and jointly participated in the actions of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing. Therefore, the "rational, peaceful, and non-violent" advocated by Yan Jiaqi and his group is completely a lie.

Fifth, Yan Jiaqi believes that the occurrence of bloody conflicts is very beneficial for overthrowing the Chinese government and the socialist system and realizing American-style democracy. In late May, he said: "When the authorities use violence against the demands of the people, they will collapse more thoroughly, and China's democratic politics will have more hope!" The same meaning, when said by the rioters on Tiananmen Square, is "We are not afraid of the authorities' suppression, but we are afraid that the authorities will not suppress." Under this ideological guidance, they not only erected an American-style "goddess" statue on Tiananmen Square to provoke the entire Chinese people, but also through actions such as destroying vehicles, setting up roadblocks, and besieging the martial law troops to provoke bloody conflicts. It can be said that the bloody conflicts were deliberately provoked by Yan Jiaqi and other "elites" and dregs.

Yan Jiaqi is very clear about the nature of his words and deeds. The reason he fled in a hurry was that he knew his crimes were heavy and he could not escape the judgment and punishment of the people. In fact, the road to the capitalist world had long been paved for him. When he called on others to forge "democracy" with blood and life and pushed students and citizens to the forefront of bloody conflicts, he himself was not prepared to pay with blood and life. Moreover, he was not even willing to take responsibility for the consequences of his actions. When those who regarded Yan Jiaqi as an "elite" and trusted him, followed him, and paid a heavy price for him to "pull chestnuts out of the fire," he fled.

The Socialist People's Republic of China Cannot Be Overthrown

After fleeing abroad, Yan Jiaqi was frantic and full of hatred. Therefore, he madly cursed the Communist Party of China for "dictatorship and despotism," cursed the People's Republic of China as an "empire" and "despotic dynasty," cursed socialism as "super-fascism," and cursed the leaders of the Communist Party of China as "emperors without titles," hysterically venting his deep hatred for the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people.

He spread rumors, portraying rioters who used stones, steel rods, guns, or Molotov cocktails to beat, kill, and burn soldiers and police, and used concrete blocks and burning vehicles to obstruct the advance of martial law troops as "unarmed, peaceful petitioners" and "unarmed, peaceful protesters" who "stopped the army from entering the city." He portrayed the limited coercive measures taken by the martial law troops during their advance as "unspeakable massacres," "unparalleled bloodshed," and "bloodbaths on Tiananmen Square," and solemnly declared that they would "continue to insist on 'rational, peaceful, and non-violent' as before." At the same time, he did not mention at all how the rioters violated Chinese laws and how the rioters beat, smashed, looted, burned, and killed. Yan Jiaqi thought that as long as they kept distorting facts and reversing black and white, the world's people would support their actions of opposing the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people. Little did they know that sympathy gained through rumors cannot last.

Yan Jiaqi went everywhere to advocate that the Chinese government "has lost any legal basis both domestically and internationally." He and his accomplices begged various countries to condemn and impose economic sanctions on China, and even begged various countries to stop economic, political, and cultural exchanges with China. This behavior completely stripped off his "patriotic" mask and exposed the true face of a traitor. Yan Jiaqi thought that as long as there was foreign pressure, we would not dare to fight to the end to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, but this was just a vain hope.

Yan Jiaqi never forgot his goal of overthrowing the People's Republic of China. He said that he wanted to raise a "tremendous and powerful hurricane that sweeps across China" to "completely destroy" the Communist Party of China and the people's government. On the day he returns in glory, he wants to "trial" the leaders of the Chinese party and state on Tiananmen Square and "re-erect the statue of the goddess of democracy." In the past, whenever he was criticized, he would quickly defend himself, saying that others had distorted his meaning and overestimated his role and power. Now, he proudly said that through channels such as "Voice of America," people inside the country can hear "our voices. Even without any organization, we can cause serious problems inside the country." He also announced in a arrogant tone that before his reactionary cause succeeds, "China has no National Day, only National Mourning Day."

To overthrow the People's Republic of China, Yan Jiaqi, soon after his escape, established the reactionary "Democratic China Front." They envisioned that "in the future, when they return to the country, they must be a party that can compete with the Communist Party." This organization regards Taiwan as the main component of the entire force seeking bourgeois democracy, and the secretary-general of the preparatory committee, Wan Runnan, said, "The base for building Chinese democratic politics can only be in Taiwan." Accordingly, Yan Jiaqi described the overthrow of the socialist system in China as the "second burial of the dynasty since the Xinhai Revolution," implying that the Beiyang Government and the Kuomintang Government were not dynasty governments, denying his own statement that "Chiang Kai-shek established a new despotic dynasty with colonial characteristics," and sending a wink to the Taiwan authorities. Yan Jiaqi's plan is: the first step, to overthrow the existing government of the People's Republic of China; the second step, to seek the legal status of various reactionary organizations such as the "Democratic Front" and bourgeois press freedom; the third step, to amend or re-enact the constitution; the fourth step, to unify China with federalism.

To boost the confidence of his overseas anti-communist and anti-China comrades in the reactionary cause, Yan Jiaqi also made so-called predictions about the situation in China. He believed that China's "economic difficulties are insurmountable" and would soon (Wan Runnan said by the end of this year) collapse; the hatred of the Chinese people towards the Communist Party of China "has exceeded the hatred towards Japan during the war"; therefore, Premier Li Peng would soon step down, and the "great hall of the People's Republic of China would collapse in an instant." These so-called predictions are just pipe dreams.

In exile, relying on the support of foreign reactionary forces, Yan Jiaqi said what he wanted to say but dared not say in the country, which is good. It makes us see that if those who stubbornly adhere to the position of bourgeois liberalization develop further and obtain the appropriate conditions, they will do what. It reminds us that the political struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat not only exists but is severe, and sometimes even a life-and-death struggle.

Yan Jiaqi's current endeavor to overthrow the People's Republic of China is just an old business that international imperialism and overseas reactionary forces have been doing for forty years. Over the past forty years, their business has not succeeded, and it can be concluded that Yan Jiaqi will not succeed either.

The Socialist People's Republic of China cannot be overthrown.

    社会主义的共和国是颠覆不了的
    ——评严家其的政治理论和政治实践
    吴大英　李延明
      颠覆中华人民共和国
        的一个“理论依据”
    1989年7月，叛逃到海外的严家其发表了一篇标题十分醒目的文章《中国并不是“共和国”》。他在文章中说，中华人民共和国并不是共和国，而是实行“专制制度”的“帝国”。在此之前，他在《五一七宣言》中还宣称，中华人民共和国政府“不是共和国的政府”。
    其实，严家其这个观点早就形成了。1980年，严家其连续发表两篇文章，一篇是《王朝循环原因论》，另一篇是《潜藏在共和国身上的王朝印记》。他在文章中说，中国历史数千年来一直处于“王朝的循环”中。中国共产党领导的武装斗争的胜利，使“古老的历史循环在二十世纪有了新的内容”，这也就是说，虽然有新内容，却仍然处在王朝循环的范围之内。那时，出于伪装自己的考虑，严家其对“中国不是共和国”的思想表达得比较隐晦。他说，在我们的“人民共和国身上潜藏着许多封建王朝的印记”，如果清除了王朝印记，中国就会成为一个“名副其实的社会主义共和国”。尽管使用了这种比较曲折的笔法，“中国不是共和国”的思想表达得仍然是十分清楚明白的。此后，严家其多次表达过类似的意思。他从其它角度提出的课题或思想，如分权制、限任制、程序政治等，也大都与这个观点有着联系。
    严家其提出这一论断的“论据”主要有四个。
    第一，“胜利了的农民战争建立起来的无一不是新的王朝，中国历史上的任何一次农民战争都没有背离这一历史规律。”“中国共产党的武装斗争，实质上是农民革命、农民战争。”因此，“按照中国历史发展的固有传统，这一次胜利了的农民战争应当在中国建立起一个新的强大的王朝。”即使由于中国共产党的出现而使历史有了“新的内容”，它也还是不能摆脱“古老的历史循环”。
    第二，“国家的最高权力最后集中于一人之手，不容许任何人、任何机构分割”，没有实行三权鼎立。
    第三，“集中在个人手中的最高权力不容转让”，即实行事实上的最高职务终身制。
    第四，“最高权力的继承是非程序的”，最高权力的继承或者以原来掌握最高权力的个人的意志为转移，或者以围绕争夺最高权力的政治斗争的结局为转移。无论哪种情况，都无程序可言。
    在当前人们对帝制早已深恶痛绝而共和国思想早已深入人心的社会意识背景下，把中华人民共和国的政治制度宣布为“帝制”，无异于把它宣布为革命对象。既然是帝制而不是共和制，当然应该推翻。颠覆帝国不但不是反动，不是反革命，反而是进步，是革命。这样，经过严家其的“论证”，颠覆中华人民共和国就成了有理的事情了。
    显然，“中国不是共和国而是帝国”是严家其为颠覆中华人民共和国而制造的一个“理论依据”，也是他为动乱和反革命暴乱提供的一个主要“理论依据”。
  “专制政体论”是彻头彻尾的歪曲
    严家其提出的“中华人民共和国政体是专制政体”的论断并不符合事实。
    第一，所谓中国共产党的武装斗争实质上是农民战争，是毛泽东在特定意义上提出的论断。这种特定意义是：武装斗争的主体主要是农民，其前进基地主要在农村，其所要完成的任务中包括土地革命。即使从这种特定意义上把中国共产党的武装斗争看成农民战争，这次农民战争也绝不可能导致新王朝的建立。因为这次农民战争所处的历史环境与以往截然不同。这次农民战争所发生的时代，人类社会已经进入使用机器进行社会化大生产的阶段，资本主义生产关系和商品交换关系正在向包括中国内陆在内的世界各地日益扩展。在这个时代里，农民革命不是成为资产阶级革命的同盟军，就是成为无产阶级革命的同盟军。从而，农民战争不是导致资产阶级共和国的建立，就是导致无产阶级共和国的建立，而绝不会导致封建专制王朝的建立。在商品交换关系日益发展的条件下，农民的自发倾向主要是资本主义倾向，而不是封建主义倾向。此时，封建关系和思想只能作为残余或影响存在，而不会成为在全国范围内占主导地位的东西，它们没有力量再造出新的封建王朝。由于得到中国共产党的领导，当代这次农民战争能够有力地超越农民自身的局限，成为彻底反封建的新民主主义的革命战争，通过土地革命，消灭地主阶级和租佃经济，挖掉封建王朝赖以建立的阶级基础和经济基础。在新民主主义革命之后，我国的社会主义革命又为社会化大生产和商品经济的发展扫清了道路，进一步消除了帝制产生的可能。这个事实是任何历史曲折也掩盖不了的。
    第二，我们国家的最高权力并不是集中在一个人手里。在执政党内，最高权力由全国代表大会行使，在其闭会期间，由中央委员会行使，日常事务则由中央政治局处理。党的委员会集体决定重大事务，在做出决定时少数服从多数，党委会的召集人即书记只有一票的权利。国家的最高权力由全国人民代表大会行使，在其闭会期间由其常务委员会行使。
    过去，在执政党内，某些领袖人物因其水平、能力、经验和威望显著地高于其他人，对最高决策集团具有极大的影响力甚至控制力，权力在事实上过于集中在他们手里。这种个人集权并没有成为一项制度。中共第十一届三中全会以后，为纠正权力在实际运行中过于集中于某些个人的现象，我们党又进一
  步加强和完善了党委的集体领导制度。
    第三，我国从来就不存在最高职务的终身制。无论是执政党还是国家政权机关，最高职务都是选举产生的。担任最高职
  务的人由于种种原因变动职务的事也是经常发生的。在我国国家政权机关及执政党内存在过某些最高领导人因众望所归，连
  选连任，甚至殁于任所的现象，但这并没有形成为一种领导职务终身的制度。为了杜绝公民终身担任最高领导职务，1982年，我国在新宪法中明文规定，国家元首和政府首脑“连续任职不得超过两届”。在中国共产党内，由邓小平同志带头，年事已高的老一辈无产阶级革命家主动退出第一线领导岗位，用自己的行动来解决众望所归的领袖在党内终身担任最高职务的问题。
    第四，我国最高权力的转移或继承是有程序的。国家最高权力产生、转移和运作的程序明确地记载在宪法和国家机关组织法上。执政党最高权力的产生、转移和运作的程序明确地记载在党章上。当然，在最高权力产生和转移之际，人们对机构设置和人选的酝酿是没有严格程序的。然而，当代各国各党都是如此。如果要求会前会外的酝酿都有严格的程序，那么世界上是不存在这种“程序政治”的。因情势变化而对原有程序变通更是各种程序中通常含有的题中应有之义。借口存在围绕最高权力组成而产生的不同意见之间的争论，断言我国最高权力的行使和更迭没有程序，是毫无道理的。
    当然，由于历史的原因，我国的政治体制并不尽善尽美。正因为如此，我们才需要改革它。事实上，在中国共产党领导下，我们正在逐步改革政治体制。这种改革属于人民共和制的自我完善，而不是对所谓“专制政体”的根本改造。严家其把中国的政体说成是专制政体，说成是帝制，是对中华人民共和国政体的彻头彻尾的歪曲。
        目的是建立资产阶级政治制度
    严家其硬说中华人民共和国不是共和国而是帝国，难道仅仅是为了提高自己的知名度而故做惊人之语吗？不是。严家其在《国家政体》一书中早已认定，无论是奴隶主国家，还是地主国家、资产者国家，都有君主制与共和制两种不同政体。在君主制与共和制这两种国家形式中可以存在不同的阶级内容。既然如此，那么严家其大谈帝制与共和制问题的目的，显然就是要避开国家的阶级性质问题，以便为在政体问题掩盖下偷运资产阶级政治制度大开方便之门。
    严家其理想中的政治制度究竟是什么样子的呢？从他的言论看，大致有以下内容。
    一、三权分立，即立法权、行政权、司法权互相独立、互相平等和互相制衡。世界上实行三权分立最典型的国家是美国。因此，严家其实际上想在中国建立美国式政治制度。严家其提出三权分立，是直接否定我国人民代表大会制度的。因为根据人民代表大会制度，我国立法机关即全国人民代表大会是唯一的最高国家权力机关。行政机关和司法机关的权力对立法机关的权力而言既不独立又不平行，不能与立法机关的权力抗衡。在我国当前的历史条件下，国家最高权力一元制有利于保持国家机关的统一和效能，是我国人民在建设社会主义的过程中探索出的行之有效的国家机关组织形式。另外，严家其认为，“在中国，在谈三权分立之前首先要解决党政分开问题”。他所谓的“党政分开”是要取消所谓“政府”之上的“政府”，也就是排除共产党对国家机关的领导。因此，他所提出的三权分立，先决条件是取消共产党的领导。
    二、政治多元化。据报道，“按照严家其的解释，政治多元化的含义就是人民享有法律所赋予的充分的结社自由，人民有按照结社法独立成立各种组织的自由。”其实际内容是使以制造动乱为宗旨的“高自联”和以推翻中国合法政府为目的的“民主中国阵线”等组织在中国获得合法地位以“和共产党抗衡”。在中国现在的条件下，提出政治多元化，是反对共产党领导的一种策略，是企图使中国向资产阶级一元化统治演变的一种过渡性口号。
    三、有一个确保私有财产权的宪法。1988年11月，严家其提出，“今后中国政治改革的首要问题是在90年代修改宪法”，要在宪法中“明确规定保护私有财产权”。严家其为什么要确保私有产权呢？他说：“只有财产的保证，才有保证言论、出版、结社等自由的存在。重新修订宪法，将确保私有产权的存在。”既然社会主义公有制是无产阶级言论、出版、结社等自由权利得以实现的保证，那么私有制自然也就是资产阶级言论、出版、结社等项自由得以实现的保证了。
    确保私有产权的重要作用，实际是在社会主义的中国为“中产阶级”的兴起创造条件。严家其一伙明白，没有这个“中产阶级”（他们心目中的中产阶级实际指的是中等资产阶级），他们所要建立的资产阶级政治制度就没有坚实、可靠、稳定的阶级基础，即使勉强建立起来，也不容易站稳脚跟。严家其的同伙
  万润南说：“‘中产阶级的兴起’是民主政制的基础。”因此，必须
  以宪法的形式来确保私有产权。
    私有产权的确立还将为“精英政治”提供经济基础。在资本主义世界里，精英指的是受过良好教育，掌握着企业、社团、大众传播手段因而能有力地影响社会生活的人物及政客和学
  者，通常只有资产者及其知识分子才有可能成为这样的精英。
  我国这次动乱的策划者们说要在中国建立“精英政治”，就是要在中国建立由资产者及其知识分子掌权和决策的政治制度。根
  据他们对“精英”这个词的用法和实际所指，他们所要实现的
  “精英政治”的目的，就是用资产阶级专政代替人民民主专政。
      四、联邦制。严家其主张，台湾、香港、大陆中国都只是
  这个联邦中的一个邦，甚至西藏也要算一个邦。人们不难看出，
  严家其之所以鼓吹联邦制，表面上是为了实现台湾与大陆的统
  一，实际上却包藏着企图分裂中华人民共和国的祸心。
    具有以上内容的政治制度，实质上是资产阶级政治制度。
    既然严家其断定中华人民共和国不是共和国而是帝国，既然严家其要在中国建立以维护私有制为第一要务的资产阶级政治制度，那么，怎样推翻中华人民共和国现存政权，何时推翻它，对于严家其来说，就只是方式和时间的问题了。
    在改革的旗号下“蚕食”和“改造”
    十年来，由于严家其受到党内支持资产阶级自由化的有力人物的赏识、提携和庇护，所以他颠覆中华人民共和国的主要方式是以争民主为名，假改革之手，企图对人民民主专政的社会主义政治制度以蚕食和偷梁换柱的方式进行改造。
    严家其自“踏入政治学王国”以后，特别是主持中国社会科学院政治学研究所的工作（到1988年7月为止）以后，便有组织有计划地贩卖西方资产阶级的政治思想。他利用我们曾经走过的以马克思主义一般理论代替政治学的弯路，在纠正这一偏差和恢复政治学独立学科地位的过程中，把学科建设引向了另一个方向，即抛开马克思主义，另起炉灶。从他对西方政治学的介绍、引用来看，他实际上认为马克思主义中没有多少政治学，只有西方资产阶级那里才有真正的政治学。他反复宣扬西方政治文化是“超越国界、超越民族界限的全人类的共同文化”的思想，以便使别人对资产阶级政治文化也放心大胆地接受。在他的影响下，一些人成了鼓吹资产阶级政治制度的积极分子，有些人甚至成了参与动乱的活跃分子。
    这几年，严家其利用我国政治体制改革之机，一方面向我国的党政决策机关兜售资产阶级的政治制度，另一方面则利用舆论工具宣传资产阶级政治学说，为在中国实行西方政治制度进行长期性的思想准备。
    同时，严家其还不断去西方取经。因为他对中国现行政治制度持有鲜明的否定态度，崇尚资产阶级民主，极力在中国推销资产阶级政治思想；因为他被赵紫阳同志的秘书鲍彤看中，参加了中央政治体制改革研讨小组的工作，有了透过鲍彤去影响中央决策的可能；所以，他受到了美国等资本主义大国的注意。在双方心照不宣的默契中，他成了美国在社会主义中国推行和平演变战略的一颗棋子，成为他们在中国思想界的代理人之一。在国内外一些人的吹捧下，严家其成了“政治体制改革理论权威”、“投掷‘炸弹’的学者”、“政治精英”、“民主斗士”和“当代世界名人”，可以说是八面来风，名噪一时。
          通过动乱和暴乱夺取政权
    严家其鼓吹资产阶级政治思想和推销资产阶级政治制度，理所当然地受到了党内马克思主义者的抵制和批评。只是由于受到鲍彤等人的保护，才得以平安过关。1988年下半年，我国经济出现一些困难，赵紫阳同志的失误有所暴露，党内对赵紫阳同志的不满有所增加。严家其感觉到赵紫阳同志地位不稳，他害怕自己推行的所谓改革方案不再得到来自党政领导决策层中有力人物的支持和保护，因此产生了一种危机感。1988年11月，他说，中国有“用非程序化的方式进行权力变动的苗头”，因而“中国现在处在危机之中”。从此，严家其改变方式，和其他“精英人物”一道，企图孤注一掷，通过策动动乱来达到他们在安定环境中难以达到的目的。
    严家其在动乱前夕和动乱中的表现，人们已经大体知道，这里不一一细谈。本文只想指出以下几点。
    一、在动乱前和动乱中，严家其的言行是不一致的。动乱前，严家其说不能“把困难或某些失误变为一种权力斗争的借口”，不能“重蹈文革的覆辙”。然而，当动乱分子们利用国家的困难和某些失误逼迫党和国家领导人交出权力，采取贴大字报、游行示威、建立非法组织等方式“重蹈文革的覆辙”时，严家其不但大加赞赏，而且积极参加。动乱前，严家其曾说“民主政治”是“程序政治”和“责任政治”。动乱中，动乱分子们一会儿说要悼念胡耀邦，一会儿又说要和中央领导人对话，一会儿冲击新华门，一会儿又非法游行和占据天安门广场，这些行动及其转换毫无程序可言。动乱分子们制造谣言，阻塞交通，破坏秩序，把不明真相的群众煽动起来以后又扬言控制不了局势，这里没有一件是负责任的行为。即使按严家其对“民主政治”的那两条界定，也绝不是什么“民主政治”。然而，严家其却居心叵测地把这种非程序行动和非责任行动称为“民主”。可以看出，严家其完全不是要争取什么民主，而是以“民主”为招牌，通过动乱颠覆合法政府。
    二、严家其利用赵紫阳同志把责任推给邓小平同志的讲话，公开亮出了自己关于中国是独裁专制制度的观点，通过《五一七宣言》，宣布中国政府“不是共和国的政府，而是在一个独裁者权力下的政府。”这个政府“不负责任和丧失人性”，因此应该
  “埋葬独裁、埋葬帝制”。这是明确无误地向动乱分子们公开发
  出的颠覆中华人民共和国的一个动员令。
    三、严家其提出打倒邓小平同志、杨尚昆同志、李鹏同志，并不只是针对他们个人的，而是针对整个中国共产党的。5月
  下旬，严家其对一个香港记者说，“执政党是组织政府的党，得不到人民信任就不能成为执政党，现在中国共产党面临很大危机”，也就是得不到“人民”信任，因此不能执政。这就清楚地
  显示了他的用意。
    四、严家其等人明白，在同共产党和人民政府拚死搏斗的关键时刻，被他们哄骗来的一般群众是靠不住的，只有对共产党和人民政府怀有刻骨仇恨的各种犯罪分子、没有改造好的刑满释放人员、地痞、流氓才真正靠得住。为了维护“政治精英”们自己“理性、和平、非暴力”的假面以欺骗世人，他们非常需要有另外的人去干“精英”们自己不便出面去干的事。这样，“精英”和渣滓在共同利益和共同目标的驱使下就结合起来了，“首都各界联席会议”和“天安门广场总指挥部”就是这样的一个联盟。这个“总指挥部”在高音喇叭中叫嚷：“工人可以动手，市民可以动手，学生决不动手，爱学生就不要再阻拦市民（动手）了”，清楚地显示了他们的策略和分工。尽管有这种分工，“高自联”和“工自联”还是共同分发了匕首、铁棍等武器，教授了制做、使用燃烧瓶和烧军车的方法，并且共同参加了打砸抢烧杀的行动。因此，严家其等人所标榜的“理性、和平、非暴力”完全是骗人的鬼话。
    五、严家其认为，出现流血冲突对颠覆中国政府和社会主义制度、实现美国式民主十分有利。5月下旬，他说：“当权者用暴力对付人民群众的要求，他们就会垮台得更彻底，而且中国的民主政治更有希望！”同样的意思在天安门广场上的动乱分子嘴里说出来，就是“我们不怕当局镇压，就怕当局不镇压。”在这个思想指导下，他们除了在天安门广场树立美国式“女神”像以激怒全中国人民以外，还通过破坏车辆，设置路障，围堵戒严部队等暴乱性行动来挑起流血冲突。可以说，流血冲突是严家其等“精英”和渣滓们蓄意挑起的。
    严家其对自己言论和行动的性质很清楚。他之所以仓皇出逃，就是因为知道自己罪孽深重，难逃人民的审判和惩罚。其实，通往资本主义世界的路严家其早就为自己铺好了。当他号召别人用鲜血和生命铸造“民主”，把学生和市民推向流血冲突的第一线时，自己却不准备付出鲜血和生命。不仅如此，他连对自己行为后果的责任都不愿承担。在那些把严家其视为“精英”而信任他、追随他的人为他“火中取栗”而付出惨重代价的时候，他却溜之大吉了。
  社会主义的中华人民共和国是颠覆不了的
    严家其逃到海外后，气急败坏，仇恨满腔。所以，他疯狂地咒骂中国共产党“专制独裁”，咒骂中华人民共和国是“帝国”、“专制王朝”，咒骂社会主义是“超法西斯主义”，咒骂中国共产党的领袖人物是“没有皇帝头衔的皇帝”，歇斯底里地发泄对中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民不共戴天的刻骨仇恨。
    他大造谣言，把手持石块、钢钎、火枪或燃烧瓶打杀烧军人和警察，用水泥墩和燃烧的车辆阻止戒严部队前进的暴徒说成是“手无寸铁，和平请愿”，“赤手空拳和平阻止军队入城”的人民；把戒严部队在开进中采取的有限强制措施说成是“惨绝人寰的大屠杀”、“无与伦比的血案”、“血洗天安门广场”；煞有介事地说要“一如既往地坚持‘理性、和平、非暴力’”。与此同时，他绝口不提动乱分子如何违反中国法律，不提暴徒们如何打砸抢烧杀。严家其以为，只要他们喋喋不休地歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，世界人民就会支持他们反中国共产党、反中国政府、反中国人民的行径。殊不知，依靠谣言换取的同情是终究不能持久的。
    严家其到处鼓吹中国政府“在国内外都已丧失了任何合法性基础”。他及其同伙乞求各国政府对中国进行谴责和经济制裁，甚至乞求各国停止同中国的经济、政治、文化往来。这种行径彻底剥下了自己的“爱国”面具，赤裸裸地暴露了卖国贼的真面目。严家其以为只要有了外国压力，我们就不敢把平息反革命暴乱的斗争进行到底，这不过是一种奢望而已。
    严家其念念不忘颠覆中华人民共和国这个目标。他说，要掀起“席卷中国的、威力无比的飓风”，来“彻底摧毁”中国共产党和人民政权。在他衣锦还乡的那一天，要“公审”中国党和国家领导人，在天安门广场“重树民主之神像”。过去，他一受到批评就急忙辩解，说人家歪曲了他的意思，过高估计了他的作用和能量。现在，他得意地说，通过《美国之音》等宣传渠道，国内的人能够听到“我们的声音。我们即使是在毫无组织的情况下，也能在国内引起严重问题。”他还以狂妄的口气宣布，在他的反动事业成功之前，“中国没有国庆节，只有国殇。”
    为了颠覆中华人民共和国，严家其出逃不久，就筹建反动的“民主中国阵线”。他们设想“以后回到国内，一定要是个政党，要能够和共产党抗衡。”这个组织把台湾作为争取资产阶级民主的整个力量的主要组成部分，其筹备组秘书长万润南表示，“建设中国民主政治的基地只能在台湾”。与此相应，严家其把对中国社会主义制度的颠覆说成是“自辛亥革命以来第二次埋葬王朝”，暗示北洋政府和国民党政府都不是王朝政府，否定自己关于“蒋介石建立的是带有殖民地色彩的、新的专制王朝”的说法，向台湾当局送去秋波。严家其的计划是：第一步，推翻中华人民共和国现存政权；第二步，争取“民阵”等各种反动组织的合法地位和资产阶级新闻自由；第三步，修改或重新制定宪法；第四步，以联邦制来统一中国。
    严家其为提高海外反共反华的同党们对反动事业的信心，还对中国形势进行了所谓预测。他认为，中国的“经济困难是无法克服的”，很快（万润南说是今年年底）就会崩溃；中国人
  民对中国共产党的仇恨“已经超过了战时对日本的仇恨”；因此李鹏总理很快就会下台，中华人民共和国的“大厦将顷刻瓦解”。这些所谓预测，不过是痴人说梦而已。
    严家其在海外，自恃有国外反动势力撑腰，把在国内想说而又没敢说的话说了出来，这样很好。它使我们看清，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人发展下去，一旦得到适当的条件，将会干出些什么事来。它提醒我们，资产阶级同无产阶级之间
  的政治斗争，不但存在，而且是严酷的，有时甚至是你死我活的。
      严家其现在所从事的颠覆中华人民共和国的事业，不过是
  国际帝国主义和海外反动势力进行了四十年的老事业。四十年
  来，他们的这一事业没有成功，可以断定，严家其也不可能成功。
      社会主义的中华人民共和国是颠覆不了的。
