	Photography [Essay]
	Bo Dong

	My mother has loved photography for half her life. My grandmother told me that when my mother was sixteen or seventeen, whenever a photographer came to the village, she would always be there. Once, she saw a neighbor's girl of the same age get a colored photograph, and she was so envious that she ran twenty miles to the county seat to get a colored photograph herself. After getting it, she happily looked at her photograph for a whole meal's time.

	In the early 1970s, during the Cultural Revolution, I was just starting primary school. One day after lunch, I came home from school and saw many people in the production team's courtyard. I went over to see what was happening and found that a photographer from the county had come to the village. I ran home and shouted, "Mom, the county photographer is here, you should go quickly. I want to take a photo too." Mother was sitting at the loom, not saying a word, still weaving the cloth with her feet and hands. My father spoke up, "After all these years of marriage, you haven't taken a photo yet. It's convenient now, you should take a few with the child. You always liked taking photos, right?" Mother stopped her hands and feet, and said heavily:

	"Back then, I was young and didn't know anything. I didn't know how poor our family was. Now, we are so poor and lacking in food and clothes. I don't even have a decent piece of clothing. Who has the heart to take a photo? Besides, the money for taking photos could buy salt for our family to eat for two months." After saying this, she continued to weave her cloth.

	The ancient and heavy sound of the loom struck my young heart.

	The year I enlisted, the rural responsibility system had been in place for several years.

	After enlisting, every time my father wrote a letter, he would tell me about the joyful changes in the village and at home. The village had set up township enterprises, the family had bought a tractor, a television, a tape recorder, built a new house, and the wheat yield per mu was over eight hundred jin, etc. The letters also mentioned that my mother had recently started thinking about taking photos again, saying she had been busy raising chickens, pigs, and doing embroidery all year round, and rarely had the time to go to the county seat...

	This spring festival, I returned to my hometown after four years of separation.

	The next day after arriving home, I took out a camera borrowed from a fellow soldier, loaded it with color film, and wanted to take photos of the whole family. Mother heard that this type of film could take colored photos, and she was overjoyed. She happily washed her face, combed her hair, and changed into a set of clothes that seemed a bit too young for her age. She also secretly applied some whitening powder to her face. She stood proudly in the courtyard, with a happy smile, feeling that this moment, though fleeting, had come after such a long and difficult journey. I excitedly pressed the shutter.

	Mom chattered, "This time it's good, all the debts from before are paid off."

	After returning to the unit, I sent the developed color photos back home, and my father wrote in a letter that Mother hummed a northern opera all day long...

    照相〔散文〕
    董少波
    母亲这半辈子就喜欢照相。听姥姥说，母亲十六七岁的时候，只要村里来了照相的，哪回都少不了她。有回她见东邻家的同龄女伴照了张相片，还上了红红绿绿的颜色，眼气的要命，拔腿去二十多里路远的县城也照了张上色的，取回来后美滋滋地瞅自己的相片足有一顿饭的功夫。
    七十年代初“文革”时，我刚上小学。有天中午放学回家，见生产队的大院里有不少人，凑过去一看，原来是县里照相馆的师傅来村里照相了。我撒腿就往家里跑，一进家门口就大声喊：“娘，人家县里照相的来了，你还不快点去。我也要照。”母亲坐在织布机上没吱声，依旧脚踏手把地织着布。一旁的父亲开口说：“结婚这么几年了，你也没有照过相，挺方便的，你就和孩子照几张去吧。你不是喜欢照相吗？”母亲停了手脚，沉重地说：
  “那时候年纪小，不懂事，不知道家里过的啥样的穷日子。现在咱这缺吃少穿的穷样，我连件象样的衣服都没有，谁还有心思照那个？再说照相的钱买成盐够咱一家子吃两月呢。”说完，又埋头织她的布了。
    古老而沉重的织布机声撞击着我幼小的心。
    我入伍那年，农村实行生产责任制已经有好几个年头了。
    入伍后，父亲每次来信，都要把村里、家里发生的可喜变化向我表述一番。村里办起了乡镇企业，家里添置了拖拉机、电视机、收录机，盖了新房，麦子平均亩产八百多斤等等。家书里还透露了母亲这两年又忽然想起照相的心思，说她成年累月地光忙于养鸡、养猪、搞编织了，难得抽空去趟县城……
    今年春节，我回分别四年之久的家乡探亲。
    到家第二天，我把从战友那里借来的照相机拿出来，装上彩卷，要给全家人拍照。母亲一听说这种胶卷照出来的照片是彩色的，脸长得白照得就白，衣服是啥色照出来就是啥色的，乐不可支，喜滋滋地又是洗脸，又是梳头，换上了一套看起来似乎与年龄有点不相称的衣服，还背着家人往脸上抹了点增白粉蜜，神气地往院子里一站，带着幸福的笑意，觉得这一瞬间尽管短的眨眼即逝，而它的到来却是那么艰难和漫长。我激动地按下了快门。
    妈妈絮叨着：“这回可好了，以前欠下的都补上了。”
    归队后，我把洗印的彩色照片寄回家里后，父亲来信说，母亲高兴地哼了一天河北梆子……
