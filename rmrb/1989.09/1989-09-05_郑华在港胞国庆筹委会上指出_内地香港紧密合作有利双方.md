Zheng Hua, Deputy Director of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong Branch, spoke at a meeting of the Hong Kong Compatriots Committee for the Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out that although there had been the "Beijing incident" recently, Chinese leaders have repeatedly solemnly declared that the policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will not change. The series of policies formulated by the Chinese government based on the concept of "one country, two systems" regarding the Hong Kong and Macao issues will also not change. The statements made by Chinese leaders are sincere, and their words are reliable. With the policy of "one country, two systems," the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the completion of the drafting of the Basic Law, we will have a political foundation for the great unity of the Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and the people of the motherland, and an important guarantee for maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao.

He said, the Hong Kong compatriots and the people of the motherland have walked together for 40 years. Over the past 40 years, common national sentiments and common economic interests have closely tied us together. Cooperation brings mutual benefits, while separation brings mutual harm. The motherland and Hong Kong are interdependent, and through close cooperation, we have jointly overcome one difficulty after another.

He also said that over the past 40 years, the mainland and Hong Kong have maintained close economic ties. Since the reform and opening up, the scale of trade between the mainland and Hong Kong has rapidly expanded. Scientific, cultural, and sports exchanges and cooperation have become increasingly close, with a promising future. These facts show that the close cooperation and mutually beneficial relationship between the two places have been recognized and accepted by an increasing number of people.

    郑华在港胞国庆筹委会上指出
    内地香港紧密合作有利双方
    本报香港9月5日电　新华社香港分社副社长郑华昨天在香港同胞庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年筹备委员会的会议上指出，前些日子，尽管发生了“北京风波”，但是，中国领导人一再郑重声明，中共十一届三中全会以来以及中共十三大确立的路线、方针、政策不会改变，中国政府按照“一国两制”的构想所制定的关于港澳问题的一系列方针政策也决不会改变。中国领导人的这些表态是真诚的，说话是算数的。有了“一国两制”的方针，有了中英联合声明，再把制定基本法的工作做好，我们就有了实现港澳同胞和祖国人民大团结的政治基础，就有了维护港澳长期稳定繁荣的重要保证。
    他说，香港同胞和祖国人民一起走过了40年的路程，40年来，共同的民族感情，共同的经济利益，把我们紧紧地联系在一起，合则两利，分则两伤。祖国与香港唇齿相依，密切合作，共同渡过了一个又一个的难关。
    他还说，40年来，内地与香港一直保持着密切的经济联系。改革开放以后，内地与香港原有的贸易往来规模迅速扩大。科技、文化、体育交流和合作日趋密切，前景良好。这些事实表明，两地之间这种紧密合作，互惠互利的关系，已为越来越多的人士所认识和接受。
