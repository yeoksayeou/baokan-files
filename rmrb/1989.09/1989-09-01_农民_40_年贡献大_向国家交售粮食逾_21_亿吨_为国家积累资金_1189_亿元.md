The hundreds of millions of farmers in our country have, over the past 40 years, created immense material wealth with their wisdom and sweat, making significant contributions to the national economy and people's lives.

Materials provided by the State Statistical Bureau indicate that from 1952 to 1988, farmers cumulatively sold 21.53 billion tons of grain, 80.62 million tons of cotton, 59.82 million tons of edible vegetable oil, 3.33 billion heads of pigs, 25.73 million tons of fresh eggs, and 81.95 million tons of aquatic products to the state. Currently, 80% of all consumer goods for the nation's population are agricultural and sideline products and their processed goods. Chinese farmers, using less than 7% of the world's arable land, have basically solved the problem of feeding nearly a quarter of the world's population, a feat that has astonished the world.

Over the past 40 years, agriculture in our country has always been the foundation supporting the socialist national economy. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, over 40 years, farmers have accumulated 11.89 billion yuan for the state through the payment of agricultural taxes. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, township enterprises have emerged rapidly. From 1979 to 1988, township and village-level enterprises cumulatively paid 9.16 billion yuan in taxes to the state. A research report from relevant departments estimates that from 1952 to 1986, farmers provided nearly 600 billion yuan in accumulation for national industrialization through price differences. Currently, the ratio of industrial and agricultural output value in our country has changed from 3:7 to 7:3. Our country has completed in 40 years what industrialized countries took a century and a half to achieve, and this would not have been possible without the great sacrifices of the farmers.

Over the past 40 years, agricultural products have always been an important pillar of our country's foreign exchange earnings, with a cumulative export value of 183.4 billion US dollars. Currently, 44% of the total export trade procurement comes from agricultural products and their processed goods.

    农民40年贡献大
    向国家交售粮食逾21亿吨
    为国家积累资金1189亿元
    新华社北京8月30日电（记者黄正根、焦然、通讯员童农）我国亿万农民40年来用智慧和汗水创造了巨大的物质财富，为国民经济和人民生活做出了重大贡献。
    国家统计局提供的材料表明，1952年至1988年，农民累计向国家交售粮食21.53亿吨，棉花8062万吨，食用植物油5982万吨，生猪33.3亿头，鲜蛋2573万吨，水产品8195万吨。目前全国人民所有生活消费资料中，80％是农副产品及其加工品。中国农民用占世界不到7％的耕地，基本解决了占世界近1／4人口的温饱，这一奇迹般的成就，令世界震惊。
    40年来，我国农业一直是支撑社会主义国民经济的基础。据国家统计局统计，40年农民通过上缴农业税的形式为国家累计积累资金1189亿元。党的十一届三中全会以来，乡镇企业异军突起，仅1979至1988年间，乡村两级企业累计向国家交纳的税金就达916亿元。有关部门一份研究报告测算表明，1952年到1986年通过价格差价农民为国家工业化提供的积累近6000亿元。目前，我国工农业产值比例已由3∶7变为7∶3，我国40年走完工业化先行国家一个半世纪才走完的路，离不开农民的伟大奉献。
    40年来，农产品始终是我国出口创汇的重要支柱，出口额累计达到1834亿美元。目前，全国出口贸易收购总额中44％来自农产品及其加工品。
