A beautiful cluster of buildings comprising a school recently appeared in Quantang Village, Hengyang County, Hunan.

This school was donated by Jiang Yongzhang, one of the founders of the Terracotta Feed Additive Factory of the Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region. The total investment was 4 million yuan, with a construction area of 15,000 square meters. In 1987, when Jiang Yongzhang made this decision, local authorities suggested naming the school "Yongzhang Middle School." However, he insisted on naming it "Aimin School."

    蒋永彰捐四百万办山乡教育事业
    本报长沙九月七日电　一所由漂亮楼群组成的学校前不久出现在湖南衡阳县泉塘村。
    这所学校由广空后勤部翠竹饲料添加剂厂创始人之一——蒋永彰捐建，总投资四百万元，建筑面积一点五万平方米。一九八七年当蒋永彰作出这项决定时，地方有关部门建议将学校命名为“永彰中学”，但他执意不肯，提出定名为“爱民学校”。
