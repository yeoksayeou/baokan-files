A Bouquet of Fragrant and Vibrant New Dance Flowers – Watching the Dance and Ballet Special Performance
Chen Xiang

In the dance and ballet special performance of the Second Chinese Art Festival, there were 3 ballets and 7 dances. Some were based on literary classics, some on operas and folk songs, and others on cave art, all with new themes.

The Central Ballet of China's three-act ballet "Lan Hua Hua" is based on the eponymous Shaanxi folk song. It is another exploration by director Shu Junjun in using Western ballet to express Chinese characters. The ballet has a complete structure and a fresh style, integrating ballet, Chinese folk dance, and modern dance. Especially in the third act, the tragic climax of the duet, it expresses the illusion of love and the desire for life, creating the image of a beautiful and lovable Shaanxi village girl who is brave in resisting feudal evil forces and pursuing pure love. Cao Zhiguang's ballet "Su San's Release," based on composer Liu Tingyu's award-winning music, breaks away from the operatic conventions in both structure and costumes, showcasing the unique charm of ballet solo and duet. It attempts to use ballet techniques to portray characters. However, audiences familiar with this operatic story understand the reason for Su San's unjust release, while those unfamiliar with the story may find it confusing at times. The ballet "Pan Jinlian" by the China Opera and Ballet Theatre, directed by Sun Dianzheng and Shen Dicai, is a highly condensed work that expresses sympathy for the tragic fate of Chinese women. Through the clever use of bamboo poles and red strings, it dramatically unfolds the entanglements between Pan Jinlian and Zhang Da Hu, Wu Dalang, and Ximen Qing, accurately capturing the characters.

The 7 dances have both folk characteristics and modern elements. Director Zhao Wanhua's "The Cheerful Girl and Boy" uses novel dance language, employing exaggerated, humorous, and open-shouldered movements to depict the feelings of contemporary young people. These movements, combined with the regional characteristics of folk dances, become a novel folk dance vocabulary. Through a lively introduction, the girl's dance, the boy's dance, the couple's dance, the emotional duet, the humorous trio, and the joyful group dance, it portrays the life scenes of the 1980s countryside. Guo Bingling and Li Lijuan's "Bright Moonlight," based on Jiangnan folk dance materials, creatively expresses the beautiful folk customs of the Jiangnan water town: the night is quiet, and under the moonlight, couples' shadows appear. After a day's labor, young farmers carry lanterns to the embrace of beautiful nature to express their feelings. The scene is elegant, the atmosphere is rich, the shapes are beautiful, and the steps are light. Wang Ming's music is delicate and lyrical, combined with Chen Junhua's sweet voice, the music and dance blend seamlessly, full of poetic beauty, making one feel the unique beauty of a beautiful Jiangnan.

Zhang Manyin's "Little Red Horse," "Gongyi Tiannv," and the adapted "Wedding," each have their own characteristics. "Little Red Horse" showcases the performers' high skills, while "Wedding" humorously and comically portrays the psychology of a newlywed couple eager to see each other's faces on their way home, full of folk comedy, making one laugh uncontrollably. "Gongyi Tiannv" is a dance inspired by the Northern Wei cave art figures, with beautiful shapes and rough movements. The drumming segment is rhythmic and refreshing. Wang Shusheng's "Farming Song" uses Shaanxi folk dance materials, and the "riding donkey" prop is innovative in both design and use, making the prop part of the dance creation.

This evening performance is uninterrupted, without an announcer, and the programs are connected by music, making it seamless. All programs are accompanied by an orchestra, enhancing the expressive power. The stage design, combining traditional paper-cutting techniques with modern layout, shapes, and colors, is simple, clear, concise, and imaginative. The unity of auditory and visual elements makes one feel complete, harmonious, and comfortable after watching this diverse performance.

    一束清香绚丽的舞蹈新花
    ——看舞蹈舞剧专场
    陈　湘
    在中国第二届艺术节舞蹈舞剧专场中，3个舞剧、7个舞蹈，有的取材于文学名著，有的取材于戏曲、民歌，还有的取材于石窟艺术，题材上都有新的开掘。
    中央芭蕾舞团三场芭蕾舞剧《兰花花》，取材于同名陕北民歌，是编导舒均均运用西洋芭蕾艺术形式表现中国人形象的又一次新探索。舞剧结构完整、风格清新，把芭蕾舞、中国民间舞、现代舞融为一体，特别是第三场悲剧高潮的双人舞，表现了爱的幻灭与生的渴望，塑造了美丽可爱、勇于反抗封建恶势力、追求纯洁爱情的陕北农村姑娘的形象。曹志光根据作曲家刘廷禹获奖音乐《苏三起解》编导的同名芭蕾小舞剧，从结构到服装都摆脱了戏曲的程式，发挥了芭蕾独舞、双人舞独特的魅力。力求用芭蕾技术来刻画人物。但熟悉这个戏曲故事的观众明白苏三含冤起解的根由，不熟悉这故事的观众难免有时费解。中国歌剧舞剧院编导孙玳璋、沈迪才怀着对中国妇女悲惨命运的同情，在高度浓缩的舞剧《潘金莲》中，通过竹竿、红绳的巧妙运用，戏剧性地展开了潘金莲和张大户、武大郎、西门庆三个人物之间的纠葛，准确地把握了人物。
    7个舞蹈既有民间特色，也具现代感。编导赵宛华创作的《俏丫头乐小子》舞蹈语言新颖，她运用夸张风趣开朗的耸肩膀动作，来描绘当代年轻人的心情。这些动作与民间舞地区特色的融合，就成为富有新意的民间舞语汇。通过生意盎然的引子、俏丫头舞、乐小子舞、二鬼抱跌舞、抒情的对舞、风趣的三人舞、欢乐的集体舞，表现了80年代农村的生活场景。郭冰玲、李丽娟根据江南民间舞素材创作的《月亮亮》，颇有新意地表现了江南水乡美丽的民俗风情：夜色宁静，月光下人影成双，青年农民劳动一天之余，打着灯笼来到美丽的大自然怀抱里抒发情怀。画面幽雅、气氛浓郁、造型优美、舞步轻盈。王鸣的曲子写得细腻抒情，配上陈俊华甜美的歌声，音乐舞蹈水乳交融，诗意盎然，令人感到一种美丽江南特有的意境美。张曼音编导的《小小枣红马》、《伎乐天女》，改编的《娶新娘》，各有特色。《小小枣红马》显示了演员高超的技术，《娶新娘》则把一对急于想看清对方容貌的新婚夫妻在归家路上的心理刻画得幽默恢谐，充满民间喜剧色彩，令人忍俊不禁。《伎乐天女》是编导眼睛中北魏石窟伎乐天女的舞蹈，造型优美，动作粗犷，击鼓一段节奏明快，令人耳目一新。汪曙生的《闹秧歌》运用了陕西民间舞素材，骑“驴”的道具在制作与运用上有所创新，使道具也参加了舞蹈创作。
    这台晚会不分场，不设报幕员，节目之间全由音乐贯串，一气呵成，所有节目都由交响乐队演奏，加强了表现力。民间剪纸式传统手法与现代布局、造型、色彩相融合的舞台美术设计、简洁、明确、洗练，富有想象力。听觉与视觉的统一，使人看完这台节目多样的演出后，不觉杂乱，而有完整、和谐、舒畅之感。
