	“Party Spirit is Priceless”
	— A Record of Yan Wenxing, Political Commissar of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province
	Wang Guoshun

	Yan Wenxing is the political commissar of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province. Everyone calls him "Old Yan." The reason is twofold: first, "Yan" sounds like "strict," and second, because he is strict in his work. If something aligns with policy, he will carry it out without hesitation; if it does not align with policy, no matter how persuasive the arguments, he will not budge. Moreover, he will scold you, completely disregarding the unwritten rule of "spare the rod for those who bring gifts."

	One day last year, a female individual entrepreneur, a tailor, used her acquaintance with Old Yan's family—she had made clothes for them—to bring an envelope containing one hundred "big notes" (100-yuan bills) when she delivered clothes to Old Yan's wife. The tailor entered Old Yan's home, left the clothes, and quickly left. After Old Yan returned home and learned of the incident, he instructed his wife to return the money that very night. The second time the tailor came to his door, Old Yan gave her a stern lecture, concluding with, "If it aligns with policy, you don't need to give a single cent, and we will do our best to help. If it doesn't align with policy, no amount of money can buy you a household registration." The tailor left with a red face, vowing never to give gifts again.

	There is a resident named Li Zhike on Dongfang Street. His eldest daughter is already eighteen, but his wife's household registration is still in the countryside. For his wife's "rural to non-rural" conversion, Old Li had submitted reports for eighteen years, each time met with silence. One day in February this year, Old Li's wife, with a glimmer of hope, visited the Public Security Bureau. By chance, she was received by Old Yan. After listening to her story, Old Yan immediately agreed to look into her case. By early April, Old Li's wife's "rural to non-rural" conversion was finally resolved. From having a full head of black hair to a full head of white hair, the couple, who had been separated for twenty years, were finally reunited. Old Li's family was so grateful they shed tears of joy.

	Old Li visited Old Yan's home, pulling out a large sum of money and a gold ring, insisting on giving them to Old Yan. Old Yan pushed back, and it was not until his wife also came out to stop him that Old Li, along with the gifts, was sent out the door unopened. As Old Li left, he repeatedly said, "I truly encountered a good Communist Party cadre!"

	From 1988 to the present, more than a year, countless people have sent money, washing machines, bicycles, imported watches, high-quality fabrics, fine cigarettes, and alcohol to Old Yan's home. The total amount of cash alone reached over 4,000 yuan. All these items were returned by Old Yan. Old Yan often says, "Party spirit is priceless. As a Communist Party cadre, am I worth only this much?"

    “党性无价”
    ——记江西省宜春市公安局政委鄢文兴
    王国顺
    鄢文兴，是江西省宜春市公安局政委，人们都叫他“老严”。一是“严”与“鄢”谐音，二是因为他办事严。符合政策的，他二话不说坚决办；不符合政策的，任你巧舌如簧说破天也白搭。而且，他还要拉下脸来批评你，全不顾“板子不打送礼的”通例。
    去年的一天，一位女个体户裁缝为恢复商品粮户口，利用在老鄢家里做过衣服认识了老鄢一家人的关系，趁给老鄢妻子送衣服时，夹带了一个内装一百张“大团结”的信封。女裁缝进了老鄢家的门，搁下衣服就走。老鄢下班后得知此事，叫妻子连夜把钱送了回去。第二次女裁缝找上门来，老鄢把她狠狠批评了一顿，最后，对她说：“符合政策的事，你分文不给，我们也会尽力去办。不符合政策，你就用多少钱也买不到户口。”弄得这位女裁缝满脸臊红，连称以后再不送礼了。
    东方街有一位叫李知科的居民，大女儿都十八岁了，妻子的户口仍在农村，为了妻子的“农转非”，老李打了十八年报告，年年是石沉大海。今年二月的一天，老李的妻子怀着一线希望，又踏进了公安局。碰巧这次接待她的是老鄢。老鄢听完她的诉说后，当即答应对她的问题进行研究。四月初，老李老婆的“农转非”终于解决了。从满头青丝到满头白发，分居了二十年的老俩口终于团圆了。老李一家感激得直流眼泪。
    老李找到老鄢家，掏出一大把钱票和一只金戒指硬往老鄢手里塞。老李左推右挡，直到老鄢的妻子也出来阻拦，才把老李连同礼品原封不动送出了家门。老李出门后连连说：“我真是遇上了一位共产党的好干部了！”
      一九八八年至今一年多，往老鄢家里送钱、送洗衣机、自行车、进口手表、高级衣料、名烟名酒等各种东西的不计其数，仅现款就达四千多元。这些东西一概被老鄢挡了回去。老鄢常对人说：“党性无价。我是一个共产党的干部，就只值这几个钱？”
