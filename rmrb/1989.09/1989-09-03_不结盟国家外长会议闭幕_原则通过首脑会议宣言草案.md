The foreign ministers of non-aligned countries concluded their meeting yesterday after a "debate-filled and critical" discussion of the draft declaration for the summit, which lasted until early this morning. The meeting officially closed with the draft declaration being approved in principle. Further refinement of certain details in the draft declaration will be carried out after the meeting.

During yesterday's meeting, the foreign ministers of Tanzania, Laos, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Vanuatu, and Uganda criticized certain positions, phrasing, and key points in the draft declaration. They believed that the draft declaration avoided addressing regional issues that are of great importance to their countries. They also felt that the assessment of the global situation and détente was "too optimistic," leading people to overestimate the global détente process. In reality, détente is not universal and does not include most developing countries, especially in important economic areas. Such assessments only benefit the superpowers. Additionally, the Palestinian representative was the only one to condemn the United States, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea suggested that Zionism should be condemned alongside imperialism, colonialism, and racism.

Some countries also hoped to modify certain details in the draft declaration, primarily concerned about whether the modernization of the non-aligned movement would lead to the abandonment of basic principles.

Apart from the aforementioned disagreements, most countries agreed with the concise principles of the draft declaration and the focus of the non-aligned movement's actions: peace, security, disarmament, economic development, protection of the human environment and human rights, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and the role of the United Nations.

    不结盟国家外长会议闭幕
    原则通过首脑会议宣言草案
    本报贝尔格莱德9月3日电　记者严正报道：昨天不结盟国家的外长们就东道国起草的首脑会议宣言进行了“充满论战语调的和批评意见的对话”，一直到今天凌晨才在原则上通过，从而宣告外长会议闭幕。会后还将对宣言草案的某些细节作进一步的完善工作。
    在昨天的会议上，坦桑尼亚、老挝、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、瓦努阿图和乌干达等国家的外长对宣言草案的某些立场、措词和要点提出了责难。他们认为宣言草案回避了对他们的国家来讲非常重要的地区性问题。对整个世界形势以及缓和估计“过于乐观”，使人们过于相信全球的缓和进程，实际上缓和并不那么普遍，并不包括大部分发展中国家，特别是重要的经济领域。这样的估计仅仅对超级大国有利。另外巴勒斯坦代表在会议上唯一谴责了美国，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建议应把犹太复国主义如同帝国主义、殖民主义和种族主义一样排入被谴责之列。
    还有些国家也希望对宣言草案的某些细节进行修改，他们主要担忧不结盟运动现代化会否导致放弃基本原则。
    除上述不同意见外，大部分国家都同意宣言草案简短扼要的原则以及提出的不结盟运动行动的重点：和平、安全、裁军、经济发展、保护人类环境和人权，加强多边合作和联合国的作用。
