Notice from the Martial Law Command of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
(No. 16)

The grand celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, through the arduous struggles of the people of the entire nation, our great socialist motherland has undergone tremendous changes, and remarkable achievements have been made in all fields, attracting worldwide attention. Holding a grand and enthusiastic celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation in the capital is a major event in the political life of our people and a glorious political task for the people of the capital. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the entire city are rallying their spirits, consolidating and developing the stable situation in the capital, working together to ensure the smooth conduct of various celebratory activities, and joyfully welcoming this glorious festival.

At a time when the people of the entire nation and the entire city are rejoicing in the decisive victory of the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and are preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, a small number of hostile elements are unwilling to accept their defeat and are still attempting to engage in sabotage activities. We must not have the slightest complacency. We hope that the people of the entire city will voluntarily comply with the martial law and various regulations, actively assist the martial law troops, public security personnel, and armed police in ensuring the safety of the National Day, maintaining social order and traffic order, preventing troublemakers from causing disturbances and sabotage, and actively reporting criminal elements. They also have the right to hand over criminals in the act to the public security organs or the martial law troops. Those who dare to test the law, defy martial law, and engage in illegal and criminal activities will be severely punished according to law.

    北京市人民政府戒严部队指挥部通告
    （第16号）
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年的盛大节日即将到来。40年来，在中国共产党领导下，经过全国人民艰苦奋斗，我们伟大的社会主义祖国发生了翻天覆地的变化，各条战线都取得了举世瞩目的辉煌成就。在首都隆重热烈地庆祝建国40周年，是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事，也是首都人民的一项光荣政治任务。全市人民正在党和政府领导下，振奋精神，巩固和发展首都的安定形势，齐心协力搞好各项庆祝活动，高高兴兴地迎接这一光辉节日。
    在全国、全市人民欢呼制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争取得了决定性胜利，并准备庆祝建国40周年的时候，极少数敌对分子并不甘心他们的失败，还在妄图进行破坏活动。我们切不可有丝毫麻痹思想。希望全市人民自觉遵守戒严令和各项法规，积极协助戒严部队、公安干警和武警部队搞好国庆安全保卫工作，维护好社会秩序和交通秩序，严防坏人进行捣乱、破坏活动，积极举报违法犯罪分子，并有权将现行犯罪分子扭送公安机关或戒严部队。对胆敢以身试法，违抗戒严令，进行违法犯罪活动的分子，将依法予以严惩。
