France Allows "Chinese Democratic Front" to Hold "Founding Conference" in Paris
China Protests Strongly
Demands France Uphold International Norms and Immediately Cease Interference in China's Internal Affairs

New China News Agency, Beijing, September 25 - A responsible official from the Western European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned French Ambassador to China, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, today to strongly protest France's approval of the "Chinese Democratic Front" holding its "Founding Conference" in Paris. The official also demanded that the French government stop the "Front" from using French territory to engage in activities against the Chinese government.

The official from the Western European Affairs Department pointed out that despite China's serious representations, the French government allowed the so-called "Chinese Democratic Front," organized by Yan Jiaqi and others, to hold its "Founding Conference" in Paris. The French government's actions are a serious violation of China's sovereignty and a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. The Chinese government expresses great indignation and strongly protests to the French government.

The official said, Yan Jiaqi and others are criminal offenders wanted by Chinese public security authorities for inciting and organizing counter-revolutionary activities aimed at overthrowing the Chinese government by force. Their establishment of the so-called "Chinese Democratic Front" aims to overthrow the Chinese government and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The French government's approval of their activities on French soil is tantamount to encouraging and supporting their anti-Chinese government activities. It is extremely rare in international relations for a country's government to openly support a small group of foreigners in conducting activities aimed at opposing and subverting the government of a country with which it has normal diplomatic relations. The French government's actions are a gross violation of the internationally recognized principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, as well as the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. This is another serious step that will damage bilateral relations.

Finally, the official pointed out that China is a sovereign state and will not allow any foreign country to interfere in its internal affairs. We firmly demand that the French government stop immediately, strictly adhere to the norms of relations between countries, and cease interfering in China's internal affairs. We also demand that the French government stop the "Front" from using French territory to engage in activities against the Chinese government. Otherwise, the French government will be fully responsible for any further damage to Sino-French relations that may result.

    法竟允许“民主中国阵线”在巴黎召开“成立大会”
    我向法国政府提出强烈抗议
    要求法方切实遵守国际关系准则立即停止对中国内政的干涉
    新华社北京9月25日电　外交部西欧司负责人今天约见法国驻华大使马乐，就法国政府允许“民主中国阵线”在巴黎召开“成立大会”提出强烈抗议，并要求法国政府制止“民阵”继续利用法国领土进行反对中国政府的活动。
    西欧司负责人指出，法国政府不顾中方的严正交涉，竟允许严家其等人策划的所谓“民主中国阵线”在巴黎举行“成立大会”。法方的行动是对中国主权的严重侵犯和对中国内政的粗暴干涉。中国政府对此表示极大的愤慨，并向法国政府提出强烈抗议。
    西欧司负责人说，严家其等人是由于煽动和组织以暴力推翻中国政府的反革命活动而受到中国公安机关通缉的刑事犯罪分子。他们成立所谓“民主中国阵线”的目的是企图推翻中国政府，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。法国政府允许他们在法国领土上这样做，就是纵容和支持他们进行反对中国政府的活动。一个国家的政府公然支持一小撮外国人在其领土上进行旨在反对和颠覆与其有着正常外交关系的外国政府的活动，这在国际关系中实属罕见。法国政府的行动是对国际法公认的相互尊重主权和互不干涉内政的原则以及联合国宪章宗旨和原则的粗暴践踏，是恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。
    最后，西欧司负责人指出，中国是一个主权国家，决不允许任何外国干涉它的内部事务。我们坚决要求法国政府悬崖勒马，切实遵守国与国之间的关系准则，立即停止对中国内政的干涉，并制止“民阵”继续利用法国领土进行反对中国政府的活动。否则，法国政府应对中法关系由此而受到的进一步损害承担全部责任。
