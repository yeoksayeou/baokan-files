Recently, the State Council forwarded a document from the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas regarding poverty alleviation work in minority areas. Relevant departments also held a special meeting on poverty alleviation work in minority areas, proposing that in the future, poverty alleviation in minority areas should be prioritized in the nation's poverty alleviation efforts. This not only reflects the Party and the government's concern for improving the living conditions of people in impoverished areas, but also demonstrates the Party and the government's consistent attention and care for minority areas and their people.

Since liberation 40 years ago, and especially since the reform and opening up, the various ethnic minorities, as members of the great family of the motherland, have followed the Party's leadership to persist in taking the socialist path. They have made remarkable changes in all aspects, which have attracted worldwide attention. This is not only reflected in the political sphere, where they have freed themselves from the shackles of feudal landlordism, feudal serfdom, and slavery; it is also reflected in the economic sphere, where they have gradually moved towards prosperity, and the living standards of the people have steadily improved. However, it must be noted that the majority of ethnic minorities live in remote areas. Due to various factors such as natural conditions, society, history, geography, and work, some regions and some people are still mired in poverty. In particular, some ethnic minority groups living in high-altitude, arid, and rocky areas have not yet fully solved the problem of basic sustenance. The facts show that they are the difficult points in poverty alleviation work. Therefore, after entering the "attack" phase of poverty alleviation work in our country, they naturally become the key points in poverty alleviation work. Whether the economic situation of these minority impoverished areas can change rapidly is not only related to whether the poverty alleviation tasks proposed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council can be smoothly implemented, and whether the goal of common prosperity for all ethnic groups that the Party has always striven for can be achieved, but it is also directly related to the unity of all ethnic groups, the stability of the border areas, and the consolidation of national defense. We must not be complacent about this. The view that the population and economic weight of minority impoverished areas are not significant and that they are of little importance to the "four modernizations" process is completely wrong. We should use poverty alleviation to demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and the Party's ethnic and enrichment policies.

It is undeniable that some minority areas are still in poverty, and their transportation and natural conditions are generally worse, and their production levels are also lower, making poverty alleviation work more difficult. However, it should also be noted that these areas generally have abundant resources, great development potential, and the people have a strong desire to escape poverty and become rich. The Party and the government also care more about them. These are all favorable conditions for winning the "attack" battle against poverty. In recent years, various places have found some effective ways to escape poverty and become rich based on their actual situations, helping a batch of impoverished households to become wealthy and cultivating a batch of leaders who lead the people to common prosperity. We should have the confidence that as the national poverty alleviation focus shifts to minority areas, these "difficult points" will eventually be overcome one by one.

Experience shows that to change the situation in minority areas, the most fundamental thing is to mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and masses of all ethnic groups, to rely on their own efforts, to strive for self-improvement, and to work hard to develop local productive forces. Various poverty alleviation measures, such as the injection of funds and materials, and the implementation of poverty alleviation projects, should aim to stimulate the production enthusiasm of the masses, achieving poverty alleviation, spiritual uplift, and economic development, so that the local masses can change from passive recipients of assistance to active participants in changing the situation. They should strive to improve production conditions, carry out economic development, and raise the level of productivity. Only in this way can the people in impoverished areas have a solid foundation for escaping poverty and becoming rich, and poverty alleviation work can achieve significant and tangible results.

At present, the self-development capabilities of impoverished areas are still relatively weak. To improve the living conditions of the people of all ethnic groups in these areas as soon as possible, it is necessary to have the concern and support of all sectors of society. Since minority areas have been designated as the key focus of poverty alleviation, relevant departments should give priority to these areas when formulating policies, plans, and implementing measures. Loans, investments, and the supply of production materials such as fertilizers, diesel, and plastic film should also be significantly better for minority impoverished areas than for other areas. It can be believed that with the strong support of the whole society and the efforts of the minority areas themselves, after a few years of hard work, the situation in those minority areas that are currently in poverty will definitely improve significantly!

    把难点当作重点
    ——谈加强少数民族地区扶贫工作
    本报评论员
    最近国务院转发了国家民委和国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组关于少数民族地区扶贫工作的文件，有关部门又专门召开少数民族地区扶贫工作会议，提出今后要把少数民族地区扶贫作为全国扶贫工作的重点来抓。这不仅体现了党和政府对改变贫困地区人民生活状况的关心，更体现了党和政府对少数民族地区和人民一贯的重视和关怀。
    解放40年来，尤其是改革开放以来，作为祖国大家庭成员的各少数民族，在党的领导下坚持走社会主义道路，各方面都发生了举世瞩目的巨大变化。这不仅表现在政治上摆脱了封建地主制、封建农奴制、奴隶制等的奴役和束缚；同时也表现在经济方面逐步走向繁荣，人民生活水平逐步提高。但是，必须看到，少数民族绝大多数生活在边远地区，由于自然、社会、历史、地理及工作等诸多因素的影响和制约，现在有部分地区、部分群众还没有摆脱贫困，尤其是地处高寒、干旱和石山地区的部分少数民族群众，还没有能够完全解决温饱问题。事实表明，他们是扶贫工作的难点。因而，在我国扶贫工作进入“攻坚”阶段以后，他们也理所当然地成为扶贫工作的重点。这些少数民族贫困地区经济面貌能否有较快变化，不仅关系到党中央、国务院提出的扶贫任务能否顺利实现，我们党一贯为之努力的各民族共同繁荣的目标能否达到，而且直接关系到各民族的团结，关系到边疆的稳定和国防的巩固。对此，我们决不能掉以轻心。那种认为少数民族贫困地区人口不多，经济比重不大，对“四化”进程无足轻重的观点是十分错误的。我们应当通过扶贫来体现社会主义制度的优越性，体现党的民族政策和富民政策。
    毋庸置疑，目前仍处于贫困状态的部分少数民族地区，相比之下，交通、自然条件都更差些，生产力水平也更低，扶贫工作难度自然更大。但也应看到，这些地区一般资源都很丰富，开发潜力很大，群众脱贫致富的愿望也很迫切，党和政府对他们更为关心。这些都是打好扶贫“攻坚”战的有利条件。近年来，各地从实际出发已经找到了一些行之有效的治穷致富的门路，使一批贫困户走上了富裕之路，也造就出一批带领群众共同走向富裕的领头人。我们应当树立这样的信心，随着全国扶贫重点向少数民族地区转移，这些“难点”终究会被一一攻克。
    经验表明，要改变少数民族地区的面貌，最根本的还是调动各族干部、群众的积极性，自力更生，奋发图强，努力发展当地的生产力。各项扶贫措施如资金、物资的投放，扶贫项目的实施，等等，应以激发群众的生产积极性为目的，做到扶贫、扶志、扶本，使当地群众由被动接受扶助的“客体”成为主动改变面貌的“主体”，大力改善生产条件，进行经济开发，提高生产力水平。只有这样，贫困地区群众脱贫致富才有坚实的基础，扶贫工作才能取得明显而实在的成效。
    在目前贫困地区自我发展能力还较差的情况下，要使这些地区各族群众生活状况尽快有个明显的改善，需要社会各方面的关心和扶持。既然已把民族地区作为扶贫的重点，有关部门在制订政策、制订计划、落实措施时就应有所倾斜；贷款、投资以及化肥、柴油、农膜等生产资料的供应，对少数民族贫困地区也应明显优于其他地区。可以相信，有了全社会的大力支持，加上民族地区自身的努力，经过几年艰苦奋斗，那些目前尚处于贫困境地的民族地区的面貌就一定能有较大的变化！
