Reporter Zhang Mingqing reports from Xiamen:

The four-day Fujian Province Foreign Investment and Trade Fair concluded successfully this afternoon. During the fair, 534 investment project contracts were signed, with a total investment of $936 million, of which $690 million is foreign investment. Export trade deals amounted to $198 million, and nine land leases covering 40 acres were agreed upon, with a total contract value of 35.69 million yuan.

This was the largest-scale international investment and trade event in Fujian in nearly 10 years. Over 3,000 guests from home and abroad attended, with nearly 100 business delegations participating. The number of attendees and the scale of contracts signed and deals made were unprecedented compared to the previous two fairs.

Compared to the last fair, this year's investment projects showed several notable changes: first, there was a significant increase in capital and technology-intensive projects; second, foreign investment shifted from individual and single-item investments to joint and series development investments; third, the proportion of foreign investment increased; and fourth, there were more wholly foreign-owned projects.

　　福建投资贸易洽谈会获成功
    本报厦门9月11日电　记者张铭清报道：历时4天的福建省外商投资贸易洽谈会，今天下午在这里圆满结束。会上签订534项投资项目合同，总投资额达9.36亿美元，其中外资6.9亿美元，出口贸易成交1.98亿美元，土地批租出让9项、面积40亩，协议金额3569万元。
    这是福建近10年来规模最大的一次大型国际投资贸易活动。到会海内外来宾达3000多人、商务洽谈团近百个。来宾之多，签订合同及成交金额之大，都是前两届没有的。
    这届洽谈会签订的投资项目与上届比，有几个显著的变化：一是资金、技术密集型项目明显增多，二是外商投资由个人、单项投资向联合、系列开发性投资发展，三是外商出资比重上升，四是独资项目多。
