The village where Chopin's birthplace is located has an interesting name: Żelazowa Wola, which translates to "Iron Will Village."

We walked into the lush, picturesque garden of the birthplace. Ah, what a tranquil place! Various colorful flowers spread a fragrant aroma, delighting the heart and eyes; tall, lush trees lined a narrow path through the woods. We walked along the path, trying to keep our footsteps light, fearing to disturb the serenity. We hadn't gone far when we saw a tall obelisk standing proudly. On it was a bronze sculpture of Chopin's head, with long hair falling to his forehead and deep, wise eyes; at the base of the obelisk was a cluster of laurel branches and an ancient Greek lyre. The entire sculpture was made of bronze, beautifully crafted, embodying the image of the famous pianist.

Continuing from there, we soon arrived at a house with gray walls, green tiles, and white window frames. This was Chopin's birthplace. The guide explained that this was originally the estate of Count Skarbek, and Chopin was born in this house. Chopin's father, Nicolas Chopin, was French. At the age of 16, he came to Poland, first working as a clerk in a tobacco factory in Warsaw. Later, he participated in the 1794 Polish uprising led by Kościuszko, joining the National Guard and being promoted to captain. After the uprising was suppressed, he taught French in many noble households to make a living. In 1802, he was hired to come to the Skarbek estate in Żelazowa Wola, where he met the cultured but impoverished relative of the owner, Tekla Justyna Krzyżanowska. They married in 1806 and had their second child, Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, in 1810.

Chopin's parents were not wealthy and could only frequently reside in the left wing of the owner's house, which was an old wooden shack without even a floor. A narrow corridor divided the house into two parts, with three rooms on each side, all very simply furnished. In Chopin's father's bedroom, there were almost no relics, only some historical pictures on the wall reflecting his life and years of struggle. The mother's room was larger. On one wall hung a plaque with the inscription: "On February 22, 1810, Fryderyk Chopin was born here." The room also had portraits of the entire family, including parents, sister Ludwika, and sisters Izabela and Emilia. Especially notable was the nineteenth-century "giraffe" upright piano, indicating that this was a poor but artistically rich family. Chopin's mother had a good musical background, playing the piano beautifully and also singing well. His father loved literature and wrote poetry. Sister Ludwika was not only intelligent but also had a high musical aptitude, serving as Chopin's first piano teacher. With his own diligent study, Chopin composed a G minor Polonaise at the age of seven, performed on stage at eight, and was hailed as a prodigy at eleven.

The living room, about 10 square meters, was the largest room in the birthplace. It was bright and clean, with a large Persian rug on the floor. In the southeast corner by the window, there was a Steinway piano, donated by an American Pole in 1945. On the wall hung a copperplate portrait of Chopin, deep and melancholic, as if capturing all the sounds of the world and contemplating deeply. This was originally an oil painting by the famous French painter Eugène Delacroix. The current copperplate portrait is a copy made by an unknown artist.

Exiting the room, in front of the house was a pool of sparkling water, with green lily pads floating on the surface. A gentle breeze blew, making them sway, full of life. By the window on the shore of the pool, there were several rows of benches. We sat on the benches, quietly listening to the performance of Chopin's music.

The piano played. The floating notes came out from the open white window, along the ivy-covered walls, along the moist air after the rain, spreading out, reaching the green trees and flowers, reaching our ears. I saw that, besides us Chinese, there were also tourists from various Western countries and groups of Polish youth. Everyone came here with a reverent heart, to visit and listen to Chopin's music. On holidays, Chopin's works are performed here.

Listening to the music, I couldn't help but think of the French writer George Sand. This novelist, who had been Chopin's lover for nearly ten years, had a keen observation and deep understanding of Chopin's creation. She described Chopin's musical creation like this: "His genius is full of a mysterious harmony with nature, this inexplicable harmony is expressed through the elegant notes in his musical thoughts, not through the rigid imitation of various sounds in the outside world. That night, the piece he created echoed the rain dripping on the roof of this cottage, but in his imagination and melody, it was expressed as tears falling from heaven onto his soul."

As the car drove away from the birthplace of this piano poet, Chopin's music still echoed in our ears, as did the guide's words: "Chopin was born here on February 22, 1810, and died in Paris on October 17, 1849. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. According to Chopin's will, his sister Ludwika brought his heart back to Poland and placed it in the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw. He only lived for 39 years!"

Indeed, the world is vast, and life is short. Although the life of an artist is short, his art is eternal.

    肖邦故居行
　　纪学
    肖邦故居所在的村庄，名字也这么有意思：热拉佐瓦·沃拉，译成中文是：钢铁意志村。
    我们走进绿树掩映、风景优美的故居花园。啊，好幽静的所在！各色各样的鲜花，喷撒扑鼻的芳香，沁心悦目；高大繁茂的树木，夹着一条林间小径。我们踏着小径前行，尽量把脚步放轻，唯恐惊扰了眼前的静谧。没走多远，见一座方尖碑巍然屹立，碑上是铜雕的肖邦头像，长发披到额前，双目深邃睿智；碑的下面，是月桂树枝簇拥的古希腊七弦琴图案。整个雕塑皆为青铜质地，造型优美，体现了著名钢琴家的风采。
    从这里继续前行不远，来到一幢灰墙、青瓦、白窗棂的尖顶房屋前。这就是肖邦的故居了。讲解员介绍说，这里原是伯爵斯卡尔贝克的庄园，肖邦就是在这房子里出生的。肖邦的父亲尼古拉·肖邦，是法国人，16岁时来到波兰，先在华沙烟草工厂当职员，后参加1794年科希秋什科领导的波兰起义，加入国家卫队，擢升为上尉。起义被镇压后，到许多贵族家里做法语教师谋生。1802年受聘来到热拉佐瓦·沃拉的斯卡贝克伯爵家中，遇到了主人有教养的穷亲戚泰克拉居斯蒂娜·克里兹萨诺夫斯卡，1806年与之结婚，1810年生下第二个孩子弗里德里克·弗朗索瓦·肖邦。
    肖邦父母的家境不富裕，只能常期寄居在主人的左厢房里，那是一座破旧的木板房，连地板也没有。一个东西穿堂，把房舍一分为二，一边三间，陈设都非常简单。在肖邦父亲的卧室里，几乎没有任何遗物，只有墙上一些反映他生活和战斗年代的历史图片。母亲的房间比较大。室内的一面墙上挂着一块牌子，上面工整地写着：“1810年2月22日弗里德里克·肖邦在此诞生”。房间里还挂着全家的画像，除父母外，还有姐姐路德维卡，妹妹依萨贝拉和爱米利亚。特别是那架十九世纪的“长颈鹿”竖式钢琴，说明这是一个穷困而又富有艺术气氛的家庭。肖邦的母亲很有音乐素养，弹得一手好琴，也擅长歌唱。他的父亲喜爱文艺，并且写过诗。姐姐路德维卡不但聪颖，而且音乐天赋极高，是肖邦钢琴的启蒙老师。再加上他自己勤奋刻苦地学习，7岁时肖邦就谱写了一首G小调波罗乃兹舞曲，8岁登台演出，11岁被誉为神童。
    不过10平米左右的客厅，算是故居中最大的房间了，窗明几净，阳光明亮，地板上铺一大块波斯地毯，房间东南角临窗的地方，摆着一架斯坦韦钢琴，它是美籍波兰人于1945年赠送的。墙上的肖邦铜版画像，深沉忧郁，仿佛在捕捉人世间的一切声音，凝神进行构思。这原是一幅油画，作者是法国著名画家欧仁·德拉克鲁瓦。现在的这幅铜版画是一位不知名的艺术家仿作的。
    走出房间，房前是一泓碧波粼粼的池水，绿色的荷叶贴浮在水面上，微风吹来，不停地晃动，生机盎然。荷池靠窗的岸上，摆着几排长椅。我们坐在长椅上，静听演奏肖邦的乐曲。
    钢琴响了。飘动的音符，从敞开的白色窗子里传出来，沿着爬满藤萝的墙壁，沿着雨后潮润的空气，扩散开来，送进绿树花丛，送进我们的耳轮。我看到，坐在这里静听的，除了我们这些中国人，还有来自西方各国的游人，有成群结队的波兰少年儿童。人们都是怀着敬仰的心情，到这里来参观，来聆听肖邦乐曲的。每逢节假日，这里都要举办肖邦作品演奏会。
    听着乐曲，我不由得想到了法国女作家乔治·桑。这位曾作了肖邦近10年恋人的小说家，对肖邦的创作有着精细的观察，深刻的了解。她这样描绘过肖邦的音乐创作：“他的天才充满着与大自然的神秘的和谐一致，这种神秘莫测的和谐是通过他的音乐思想中的那些高雅的音符，而不是通过对外界各种声音的生硬模拟而表现出来的。他在那天晚上创作出来的这首曲子回荡着这幢村舍的屋顶上淅沥作响的雨声，不过，这一切在他的想象里和曲调中却表现为上天坠落在他心灵上的泪珠。”
    当汽车驶离这钢琴诗人的故居，我们耳畔还响着肖邦的乐曲，还响着讲解员的话：“肖邦1810年2月22日出生在这里，1849年10月17日逝世于巴黎，葬在拉雪兹神甫墓地。遵照肖邦生前遗嘱，他的姐姐路德维卡将他的心脏带回波兰，放置在华沙的圣十字教堂内。他只活了39岁！”
    是啊，世界是浩大的，人生是短暂的。艺术家的生命虽然短暂，但他的艺术却是长久的。
