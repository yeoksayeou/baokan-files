	Significant achievements have been made in national minority work across the country, particularly in the cultivation and promotion of over a million minority cadres. The economy, culture, and education in minority regions have developed rapidly.

	According to materials provided by the National People's Congress Committee on Ethnic Affairs, since the founding of New China, especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, significant achievements have been made in national minority work across the country.

	These achievements include:

	— A large number of minority cadres have taken up leadership positions. With the implementation of the policy of regional ethnic autonomy, various autonomous regions have cultivated and promoted a large number of minority cadres. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently over a million minority cadres nationwide.

	— Economic and cultural development in minority regions has been substantial. In 1988, the total social output value of the five autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Ningxia reached 141.768 billion yuan, with a total national income of 77.865 billion yuan and a per capita national income of approximately 951 yuan.

	— The development of education and culture in minority regions has also been notable. According to preliminary statistics, the number of minority college students and graduate students nationwide has reached over 130,000, more than tripling since 1978. The number of middle school students is 3,073,000, and the number of primary school students is 10,510,000, which are 21.1% and 39.8% higher than in 1978, respectively.

	— All ethnic minorities across the country have actively contributed to the Four Modernizations of the country. According to incomplete statistics, from 1980 to 1987, the minority regions nationwide provided the country with 174 million sheep for meat, 18.25 million cattle for meat, 163 million pigs for meat, 10 million tons of wool and cashmere, 137 million cubic meters of timber, 16.22 million tons of steel, 570 million tons of raw coal, 58.08 million tons of crude oil, and 24.25 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

	Due to the implementation and enforcement of the Party's policies of ethnic equality and unity, the ethnic relations in our country have fundamentally improved, and a new type of socialist ethnic relationship of equality, unity, and mutual assistance has been established among the various ethnic groups.
