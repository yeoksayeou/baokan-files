Since entering the transition period in 1988, Macau has maintained social stability. The four major economic pillars—export processing, tourism, construction and real estate, and finance—have continued to develop. Foreign investment has significantly increased, and various large-scale construction projects are progressing smoothly. The positive economic progress indicates that this region is full of vitality and has a bright future.

Export processing, which accounts for one-third of Macau's GDP, is the region's largest economic pillar. It emerged in the mid-1970s and has seen annual growth rates often exceeding double digits. While the recent growth rate has slowed, it still increased by 6.9% last year, setting a historical record of 12 billion Macau patacas in industrial exports. Since the second quarter of this year, the industry has reversed the decline in exports seen in the first quarter, and industry insiders estimate that the full-year export volume will grow by 5% to 10%.

The rapid development of the tourism industry has driven the overall prosperity of commerce and services, making it a distinctive feature of Macau's economy during the transition period. Macau received over 5.1 million tourists last year, ten times the local population. This year, the number of tourists has increased further, and it is expected to exceed 6 million. Hotels, restaurants, shops, and the entertainment and gambling industries are all thriving, bringing substantial economic benefits to Macau.

After four consecutive years of boom, the construction and real estate industry has entered an adjustment period earlier than expected due to the impact of the Beijing events. However, current property prices are still higher than last year and are showing signs of stabilizing and rebounding. Industry insiders are confident about future market conditions.

The financial industry has developed steadily, with all banks reporting profits. The initial "run on the banks" at Chinese-funded banks has now returned to normal. According to statistics published in the quarterly report of the Bank of Macau, as of the end of June this year, the total deposits of banks in Macau increased by 6% compared to the end of last year, and the loan amount increased by 13%.

The development of various economic sectors has significantly increased government revenue, reaching 2.94 billion Macau patacas last year, an increase of nearly 20%. This year's revenue is even better, and it is expected to set a new record.

Capital from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea has been continuously flowing into Macau, investing in tourism services, commerce, shipping, and real estate. This new phenomenon not only injects new vitality into Macau's economy but also indicates that foreign investors are confident in Macau's future. Local businessmen are also strengthening their investment intentions in industry and commerce.

Large-scale construction projects such as the Macau International Airport, deep-water port, Tamar Tunnel, and the second bridge connecting Macau to Taipa, along with the new city of Taipa, are being carried out at a rapid pace during the transition period. These projects inspire the people's ambition to prosper Macau and provide a powerful driving force for the region's economic development.

    澳门过渡期经济充满活力
    钟征祥
    澳门自1988年踏进过渡期以来，社会安定，出口加工业、旅游、建筑地产及金融业四大经济支柱续有新的发展。外来投资显著增加。各项大型建设进展顺利。经济喜人的进步，显示了这个地区充满活力，前景广阔。
    占澳门生产总值三成的出口加工业，是澳门最大的经济支柱，它于70年代中期崛起之后，历年增幅多达两位数。近期发展速度有所放缓，但去年仍增长6.9％，创造了工业出口总值120亿澳门元的历史纪录。今年进入第二季度以后，亦扭转了首季出口大跌颓势，业内人士估计，全年出口额会有5％至10％的增长。
    旅游业迅猛发展，带动了商业、服务业的全面兴旺，是澳门进入过渡期经济显示的一个特色。澳门去年游客总数达到510多万人次，是本地区人口的10倍。今年来游客更众，预计全年可突破600万人次。酒店、酒楼、餐厅、商店及娱乐博彩业生意滔滔，给澳门带来了可观的经济收益。
    建筑地产业在经过连续4年旺景之后，近来受北京事件影响，提早出现调整期，但目前楼价仍较前年为高，而且正呈止跌回升之势。建筑地产界人士对未来行情具有信心。
    金融业发展平稳，各家银行均有盈利。中资银行前段一度发生“挤提”，如今业务已逐步恢复正常。据澳门银行季报公布的数字统计，今年6月底，澳门各银行存款余额比去年底上升了6％，放款额增加13％。
    各项经济发展使澳府财政收入大增，去年达29.4亿澳门元，增幅近两成。今年收入更佳，预料将可再创新纪录。
    台湾、日本及南朝鲜的资金源源流入澳门投资旅游服务业、商业、船运及地产业，是澳门过渡期的新现象，它不仅给澳门经济注进了新血，而且表明了外来投资者对澳门未来的前途有信心。本地商人对工商业投资意欲也加强了。
    澳门国际机场、深水港、松山隧道及第二座澳氹大桥与氹仔新城等大型建设，在过渡期紧锣密鼓地进行，振奋着人们繁荣澳门的雄心，给澳门经济发展增添了一股强大的推动力。
