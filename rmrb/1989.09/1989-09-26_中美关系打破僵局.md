With the changing international situation and China's growing strength, the United States gradually realized that its policy towards China needed to change. Both China and the United States believed that normalizing relations served the fundamental interests of both countries. Since the early 1970s, the stalemate in China-US relations, which had lasted for more than 20 years, began to ease.

After Nixon took office in 1969, he repeatedly expressed his desire to improve relations with China through various means. The Chinese leadership and government welcomed this.

On April 6, 1971, China invited the U.S. table tennis team, which was participating in the 31st World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan, to visit China. This was a major step taken by China to restore contact with the United States and was hailed by international opinion as "ping-pong diplomacy." Soon after, at the arrangement of both sides, U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger secretly visited China from July 9 to 11, 1971, and had frank discussions with Premier Zhou Enlai on China-U.S. relations, especially the Taiwan issue.

On February 21, 1972, U.S. President Nixon visited China. During his visit, he met with Chairman Mao Zedong and held talks with Premier Zhou Enlai. On February 28, 1972, after repeated consultations, the two sides finally signed the "Joint Communiqué" (also known as the "Shanghai Communiqué") in Shanghai. The "Joint Communiqué" listed the different views of both sides on major international issues and affirmed that the two countries' social systems and foreign policies had fundamental differences. It emphasized that both sides agreed to handle relations between countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The issuance of the "Joint Communiqué" marked the beginning of the normalization of China-U.S. relations and laid the foundation for further improvement and development of relations between the two countries.

    中美关系打破僵局
    随着国际形势的变化和中国的不断强大，美国逐步认识到其对华政策非改变不可。中美两国都认为，走向关系正常化符合两国的根本利益。自70年代初开始，僵持了20多年的中美关系开始缓解。
    1969年尼克松入主白宫后，通过各种方式一再表示要同中国和好。中国领导人和中国政府对此表示欢迎。
    1971年4月6日，中国邀请在日本名古屋参加第31届世界乒乓球锦标赛的美国乒乓球队访问中国，这是中国为恢复中美接触而采取的一个重大步骤，被国际舆论称为“乒乓外交”。此后不久，在中美双方的安排下，美国总统国家安全事务助理基辛格于1971年7月9日至11日秘密访问中国，同周恩来总理就中美关系，特别是台湾问题坦率地交换了意见。
    1972年2月21日，美国总统尼克松来华访问。访问期间，他会见了毛泽东主席，同周恩来总理进行了会谈。1972年2月28日，中美双方经过反复磋商，终于在上海签订了《联合公报》（即《上海公报》）。《联合公报》在列举了双方对重大国际问题的不同观点、肯定了中美两国的社会制度和对外政策有着本质区别之后，强调指出双方同意以和平共处五项原则来处理国与国之间的关系。《联合公报》的发表标志着中美两国关系正常化的开始，为今后两国关系的进一步改善和发展打下了基础。
