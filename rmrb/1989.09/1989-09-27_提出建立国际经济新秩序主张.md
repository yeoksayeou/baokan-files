From April 6 to 16, 1974, the Sixth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which discussed issues of raw materials and development, was held at the United Nations headquarters. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping led the Chinese delegation to attend the conference. At the meeting, Vice Premier Deng expounded on China's stance on establishing a new international economic order, pointing out: The political and economic relations between countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; international economic affairs should be managed by all countries in the world together, rather than being monopolized by a few countries. The developing countries, which make up the vast majority of the world's population, should participate in deciding major issues in international trade, currency, shipping, and other areas. Developing countries should enjoy and exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. Their demands to improve foreign trade conditions should be met, and their various raw material exporting organizations should be supported. Economic aid to developing countries should strictly respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries, without attaching any political or military conditions, and without seeking any special privileges. Loans provided to developing countries should be interest-free or low-interest, and if necessary, repayment can be deferred or even waived. Technical assistance to developing countries should be practical, effective, affordable, and convenient. Experts and personnel sent to the recipient countries should seriously teach technology to the local people, respect the laws and customs of the recipient country, and should not demand special treatment or engage in illegal activities.

Under the joint efforts of China and the broad Third World countries, the Sixth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the "Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order" and the "Program of Action." This is a brilliant achievement of the unity and struggle of developing countries in the international economic field.

    提出建立国际经济新秩序主张
    1974年4月6日至16日，讨论原料和发展问题的第六届联合国大会特别会议在联合国总部举行。邓小平副总理率我国代表团出席了会议。邓副总理在会上阐明了中国关于建立国际经济新秩序的主张，指出：国家之间的政治和经济关系，都应该建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上；国际经济事务应该由世界各国共同来管，而不应该由少数国家来垄断。占世界人口绝大多数的发展中国家应该参与决定国际贸易、货币、航运等方面的大事；发展中国家对自己的自然资源应该享有和行使永久主权，它们关于改善对外贸易条件的要求应该予以满足，它们建立的各种原料输出国组织应该得到支持；对发展中国家的经济援助应该严格尊重受援国的主权，不附带任何政治、军事条件，不要求任何特权；对发展中国家提供的贷款应该是无息或低息的，必要时可以延期偿付甚至减免；对发展中国家的技术援助应该实用、有效、廉价、方便，派往受援国的专家和人员应该向受援国人民认真传授技术，尊重受援国的法令和民族习惯，而不应该要求特殊待遇，更不得进行非法活动。
    在中国和广大第三世界国家的共同推动下，第六届特别联大通过了《建立新的国际经济秩序宣言》和《行动纲领》。这是发展中国家在国际经济领域团结斗争的光辉成果。
