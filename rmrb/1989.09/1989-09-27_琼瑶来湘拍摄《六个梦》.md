The 38-episode television series "Six Dreams" began shooting in Changsha today. The series is a collaboration between Hunan Television and the Taiwan-based Yi Ren Transmission Company.

The drama is adapted from the novel of the same name by Taiwanese writer Qiong Yao. It consists of three parts: "Three Flowers," "Wan Jun," and "Mute Wife," reflecting the struggles of a group of young men and women in mainland China during the early Republic era. They broke free from feudal family constraints, pursued marital freedom, and ultimately transformed into a new generation, experiencing a painful and arduous journey.

Yi Ren Transmission Company is owned by Qiong Yao and her husband Ping Xintao. To ensure the successful collaboration on this film, they led a crew of over 60 people to the mainland.
