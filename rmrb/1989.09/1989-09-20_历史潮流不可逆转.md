Our great socialist republic has written a glorious history over the past forty years. As we look forward to the bright future of our motherland, I, as a Taiwanese compatriot who has spent thirty-seven years on the mainland, cannot help but feel regret that the Taiwan Strait has not yet ended the situation of "thirty years of brothers living in different homes, a family's children scattered in different places" (as Mr. Lian Heng said). This makes me, like millions of compatriots, strongly wish to strive for the reunification of the motherland with all my might. Over the years, the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, as an organization of Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland, has actively served Taiwanese compatriots at home and abroad and worked hard to promote various exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, making its own efforts to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In our work, we deeply feel that the policy of "one country, two systems, and peaceful reunification" is in line with the fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

In the past two years, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has undergone dramatic changes, and the relations between the two sides have developed accordingly. These changes and developments are the result of the joint efforts of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots. What is particularly noteworthy is that in recent years, Taiwanese compatriots have done a great deal of work and made unremitting efforts to improve cross-strait relations. They have demanded that the Taiwan authorities lift the "martial law," lift the ban on political parties, abandon the "three nos," and achieve "three links," launching wave after wave of demands to return home to visit relatives, making significant contributions to opening the door to the mainland that has been closed for 40 years and forcing the Taiwan authorities to allow Taiwanese compatriots to visit the mainland. Since the Taiwan authorities allowed Taiwanese compatriots to visit the mainland in November of the previous year until this May, about 700,000 Taiwanese compatriots have visited the mainland, and various exchanges between the two sides have also developed. In this year and a half, the number of compatriots from Taiwan Island received by the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots has been high (for the first time exceeding the number of compatriots from overseas), and the scope has been wide, and we have established good hometown friendships.

During the turmoil in Beijing, the Taiwan authorities took the opportunity to send agents to the mainland to interfere in the turmoil, and in the island, they revived the "anti-communist hostile consciousness," and externally, they attempted to expand their "international activity space" and promote flexible diplomacy, doing many things that go against the tide of history. The situation in Beijing quickly stabilized, and the number of compatriots from the island increased rapidly, and it is expected that the number of people visiting the mainland this September will exceed the same period last year. Economic activities between Taiwan and the mainland have also not been seriously affected. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reaffirmed that the policy of reform and opening up will not change, and the policy towards Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan will not change. We believe that people from all walks of life in Taiwan, Taiwanese compatriots, will work together with compatriots of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and make greater contributions to further developing the "three links" across the Taiwan Strait and promoting the process of national reunification!

    历史潮流不可逆转
　　中华全国台湾同胞联谊会会长　林丽韫
    我们伟大的社会主义共和国谱写了四十年光辉的历史。在展望祖国美好未来的时候，作为一名在祖国大陆度过了三十七个春秋的台湾同胞，我对台湾海峡两岸至今未能结束“卅载兄弟犹异宅，一家儿女各他方”（连横先生语）的状况不能不感到遗憾，从而使自己也同千千万万同胞一样产生愿为实现祖国的统一而不遗余力地努力的强烈愿望。多年来，中华全国台湾同胞联谊会作为在大陆上的台胞的同乡会组织，积极为海内外的台湾乡亲服务，努力促进海峡两岸各种交流，为促进祖国的和平统一做出了自己的努力。我们在工作中深深体会到“一国两制、和平统一”的方针是符合海峡两岸人民的根本利益的。
    近两年来，台湾海峡两岸的形势有了急剧的变化，两岸关系随之有了新的发展。这些变化和发展是大陆同胞和台湾同胞共同努力的结果。特别令人瞩目的是这些年来，台湾同胞为改善两岸关系作了大量的工作和不懈的努力。他们要求台湾当局废除“戒严令”，开放党禁，放弃“三不”，实现“三通”，掀起了一波又一波要求返乡探亲的浪潮，为打开关闭了40年的台湾通往大陆的门，迫使台湾当局允许台胞到大陆探亲，作出了很大的贡献。自前年11月台湾当局开放台胞来大陆探亲到今年5月，约有台胞70几万人次来大陆，随之两岸的各种交流也有所发展。在这一年多时间里全国台湾同胞联谊会接待的来自台湾岛内的同胞数量多（第一次超过来自海外的同乡）、层面广，我们之间建立了良好的乡情友谊。
    在北京发生动乱时，台湾当局借机派特务来大陆插手动乱，在岛内又重弹“反共敌对意识”，对外则妄图扩大“国际活动空间”，推行弹性外交，做了许多逆历史潮流而动的事。北京的形势很快平稳，来自岛内的同胞人数迅速回升，今年九月可望超过去年同期来大陆的人数。台湾同大陆之间的经济活动也没有受到严重影响。中共十三届四中全会重申改革、开放的政策不变，对港澳台的政策不变。我们相信台湾的各阶层人士、台湾同胞将同祖国各族同胞彼此同心，共同努力，在今后进一步发展海峡两岸的“三通”，推动祖国统一的进程中作出更大的贡献！
