Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 27th

A U.S. witness, Robin Munro, who was one of the last people to leave Tiananmen Square on the morning of June 4th, wrote in the Hong Kong-based *South China Morning Post* that there were "no signs of panic" and "no indication that any massacre had just taken place" as students withdrew from the square.

The title of Robin Munro's article is "A Last Glimpse of Tiananmen." The *South China Morning Post* published the article on September 23rd with an editor's note stating that the author is a researcher for the U.S. human rights organization "Asian Watch Committee" and was among the last to leave the square before the military entered on the morning of June 4th. The article provides a summary of what he witnessed.

Robin Munro's article states that at 11 p.m. on June 3rd, as an armored vehicle drove east along Chang'an Avenue from the direction of the square, he was standing on the steps of the Beijing Hotel. He immediately hired a tricycle to follow the armored vehicle to the intersection of Jianguomen. Later, he returned to the square by tricycle, arriving at 1:15 a.m. He jumped off the tricycle and headed straight for the north end of the square.

The article states, "I could see an armored vehicle burning, emitting thick smoke and flames. I pushed through the crowd towards the Monument.

"Almost all the students had retreated from the surrounding area to the three-tiered base of the Monument, where about 3,000 to 5,000 people were sitting, huddled together.

"The atmosphere around the Monument was calm, almost oppressive, but it was clear that the students were not terrified. I stayed there for about 10 minutes, then walked towards the almost deserted north side of the square."

The article states that at 2 a.m., the first troop carriers began to enter the square from the northwest. Soldiers signaled for him to leave immediately. He walked towards the Museum of Chinese History.

The article states that around 4 a.m., all the lights in the square went out. By 4:30 a.m., there were only about 3,000 students left, crowded onto the steps of the Monument. Later, Hou Dejian and three other hunger strikers spoke, urging the students to leave the square. The students voted on whether to leave. A voice announced through a megaphone: "The democratic vote is to leave Tiananmen Square." People began to stand up slowly and walk down the steps, forming lines of ten, each following their school flag.

The author states, "It was exactly 5 a.m. I looked north and saw that the 'Goddess of Democracy' was gone. I ran north and suddenly encountered a line of armored vehicles slowly moving towards the Monument, followed by soldiers in helmets."

"As I returned to the other side of the Monument, I found that the students had set up a cordon between the Monument and the Museum of Chinese History. I walked in and stood behind the cordon with them, retreating at the same speed as the advancing armored vehicles.

"I turned left and saw that the top tier of the Monument was full of soldiers. On the lower tiers, there were still many students, slowly withdrawing from the base of the Monument.

"There were no signs of panic, and no indication that any massacre had just taken place. As dawn broke, the student columns finally retreated to the south side of the Mao Zedong Mausoleum and left the square to the southeast."

Robin Munro's article states that he reached the eastern side of Qianmen Gate before 6 a.m., at which time almost no one was left in the square. "By 6:15 a.m., the orderly withdrawal from the square had ended."

The *South China Morning Post* reported on the same day that Robin Munro arrived in Beijing on May 13th, ostensibly to research a guidebook on the Yellow River, but in reality, he was fully involved in the turmoil in Beijing. For many days, he stayed on the square day and night, collecting a large amount of documents and materials. He speaks fluent Chinese.

    美国一名目击者在香港《南华早报》发表文章说
    天安门广场没有发生流血事件
    新华社香港9月27日电  6月4日清晨最后离开天安门广场的人之一罗宾·芒罗在此间《南华早报》发表的一篇文章中说，学生在撤离天安门广场时“没有恐慌的迹象，也没有一点迹象表明刚刚发生过任何大屠杀。”
    罗宾·芒罗文章的题目是《对天安门的最后一瞥》。《南华早报》9月23日刊登这篇文章时发表编者按说，作者是美国人权组织“亚洲监督委员会”的调研工作负责人，是6月4日清晨军队进驻天安门广场前最后一批离开广场的人之一，他的文章对他亲眼所见的情景作了概括性的叙述。
    罗宾·芒罗的文章说，6月3日晚11点，当一辆装甲车从广场方向沿长安街向东驶来时，他正站在北京饭店门口的台阶上。他立即雇一辆三轮车跟在装甲车后面，到了建国门十字路口。后来他又乘三轮车回广场，到广场时是1点15分。他跳下三轮车直奔广场北端。
    文章说，“我可以看到一辆正在燃烧的装甲车冒着浓烟和熊熊的火焰。我穿过人群向纪念碑走去。
      “几乎所有的学生都已从四周撤到了纪念碑的三级台阶上，看起来有3000至5000人坐在那里，互相靠得紧紧的。
      “纪念碑上的气氛是平静的，几乎令人感到压抑，但可以肯定，学生们没有惊恐感。我在那里停留了10分钟，然后向已经几乎无人的广场北面走去。”
    文章说，凌晨两点，第一批运兵卡车开始从西北方向开进广场。军人示意要他立即离开。他走向历史博物馆。
    文章说，大约4点钟，广场的灯全部熄灭。到4点30分，广场上留下的人已很少，只有3000左右的学生挤在纪念碑的台阶上。后来侯德健及其他三位参加绝食的人发表讲话要求学生离开广场。学生们对是否离开进行了表决。一个声音通过麦克风宣布：民主表决同意离开天安门广场。人们开始慢慢站起来走下台阶，排成10人一排的队伍，各自跟在自己校旗的后面。
    文章作者说，“现在正好是5点钟，我向北面望去，发现‘民主女神像’已不在了。我向北面跑去，突然遇到一排装甲车，正缓缓向纪念碑开来，后面跟着一些头戴钢盔的战士。”
      “在返回纪念碑那一边时，我发现学生已在纪念碑和历史博物馆之间拉了一道纠察线。我走进去就站在纠察线的后面，同他们一起后退。后退的速度同向前开进的装甲车队的速度完全一样。
    “我向左转身，看到纪念碑最高一层全是士兵。在下面几层还有许多学生，他们正缓慢地撤离纪念碑底座。
    “没有恐慌的迹象，也没有一点迹象表明刚刚发生过任何大屠杀。天快亮时，学生队伍终于退到毛主席纪念堂南面，并向东南方向离开广场。”
    罗宾·芒罗的文章说，他在6点钟之前到达前门东大街，这时几乎已经没有什么人留在广场上了。“到6点15分，广场上有秩序的撤退已经结束。”
    《南华早报》同一天报道说，罗宾·芒罗是5月13日抵达北京的，名义上是为了研究出版一本黄河旅游指南，实际上完全卷入了北京发生的动乱。他有许多天都是日夜呆在广场上，收集了大量文件和材料。他能讲一口流利的汉语。
