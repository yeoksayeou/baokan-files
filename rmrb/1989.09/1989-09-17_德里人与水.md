The scorching heat of Delhi is always accompanied by dryness. After nearly half a year of the dry season, by May and June, the temperature reaches its peak, sometimes even soaring to 47-48 degrees Celsius. During this period, it rarely rains, making Delhi feel like a giant oven. Some trees' leaves dry up and fall off; the once lush green lawns turn yellow, but as soon as water is poured on them, they quickly turn green again. People's sweat also evaporates as soon as it comes out of their pores.

In this dry and hot weather, people cannot do without water for a moment. When I first arrived in Delhi, Indian friends advised me that during the summer, one must drink plenty of water or carry enough water when going out. This is their hard-earned experience. I noticed that many people indeed do not forget to bring a bottle of water or some drinks when they go out. On the streets, water stalls and public drinking fountains are everywhere. Indians drink water very simply, using their right hand to catch the water from the tap and drinking it directly. Walking around Delhi, you might see large water tankers or public water taps surrounded by lively crowds. Old people, children, men, and women, all with water pots, buckets, or basins, gather to collect water for the day or the next. At this time, the sound of flowing water, people's laughter, and the clanking of buckets all seem moist and full of vitality.

Hindu believers regard the mighty Ganges River as a sacred river. They consider it a lifetime honor to be able to bathe in it and drink a sip of its holy water. At the end of one's life, if one can purify oneself in the sacred river and then be cremated, with the ashes scattered in the river, they believe they can achieve eternal peace of the soul. Early this year, during the bathing festival in the city of Allahabad on the banks of the Ganges, millions of men, women, and children jumped into the icy river to bathe in the chilly spring, creating a magnificent scene. However, in recent years, due to the increasing pollution of the Ganges, some urban Hindus are not as enthusiastic about this as they used to be.

The people of Delhi especially look forward to the annual Indian Ocean monsoon because it brings precious rainwater. The amount of monsoon rain determines the agricultural harvest. Last year, out of 35 meteorological zones nationwide, 32 had normal or abundant rainfall, bringing India a bumper agricultural harvest, with grain production reaching a record high of 172 million tons. Agricultural failures are often linked to insufficient monsoon rain. The Indian government at various levels fully recognizes the special importance of water, allocating a large amount of funds to implement drinking water plans and strengthen irrigation plans, achieving significant results. The Delhi municipal government has taken measures such as developing groundwater, building more wells, and expanding water treatment plants to address the long-standing problem of insufficient drinking water in Delhi. This year, the water supply has reached 409 million gallons per day, with an average of 53 gallons per person per day. Although the supply is still insufficient, the situation has eased. To protect the patches of lawns that are like hungry infants and not to occupy the residents' drinking water, the government laid 25 pipelines this year to directly draw river water for irrigation.

　　德里人与水
　　文东
    德里的酷暑总是伴随干燥而来。持续了近半年的干季到了五六月份，气温便升到最高点，有时竟达47—48摄氏度，而这期间又极少下雨，德里简直成了一个大“烤箱”。有些树的叶子被烘干了，纷纷下落；本来绿茵茵的草坪也被烤黄了，但是，只要浇上一点水，就又会立刻返青；人们身上的汗水也出得很少，似乎一钻出汗毛孔就被蒸发掉了。
    在这燥热的天气里，人们一刻也离不开水。初到德里时，印度朋友告诫我，夏天外出时一定要喝饱水，或者带足水。这是他们的经验之谈。我发现许多人出门确实不忘带上一瓶水或者一些饮料。大街小巷，卖水的摊子、公共饮水处到处可见。印度人喝水也很简单，右手在水龙头下接着水，嘴凑上去吸就是了。漫步在德里街头，你有时会看到硕大的水罐车或者公用水龙头周围聚集着热热闹闹的人群。老人、孩子、男人、妇女，顶着水罐，提着水桶，端着水盆，为当天或明天储水。这时，欢畅的流水声，人们的嬉闹声，水桶的碰撞声仿佛都变得湿润润的，充满了勃勃生气。
    印度教徒把最大的河流恒河奉为圣河，以能去那里沐浴一次，喝上一口圣水为终生的荣幸。在一生终结之时，如能在圣河里净身后火化并把骨灰撒在其中，他们便认为可以得到灵魂的永世安宁。今年年初，恒河岸边城市阿拉哈巴德在过沐浴节时，数百万男女老少在春寒料峭之中跳进冰冷的河水里沐浴，景象壮观。不过，这些年来，由于恒河污染日益严重，城市里的一些印度教徒对此已不如以前那么热衷了。
    德里人尤其盼望一年一度的印度洋季风，因为它能带来珍贵如油的雨水。季风雨量的大小就是农业收成的丰歉。去年，全国35个气象区中32个雨量正常或充沛，为印度带来了农业大丰收，粮食产量创最高记录，达1.72亿吨。而农业歉收常与季风雨不足相联系。印度各级政府充分认识到水的特殊重要，拨出大量款项，推行饮用水计划和加强农田灌溉计划等，取得了不少成效。德里市政府采取开发地下水、增建机井、扩大自来水厂等措施，努力解决一直困扰德里人的饮用水不足问题。今年供水量已达每天4.09亿加仑，人均每天53加仑，虽然仍是供不应求，但紧张状况已有缓解。政府为保护那一片片像嗷嗷待哺的婴儿一样的草坪，而又不挤占居民的饮用水，今年铺设了25条管线，直接引河水进行浇灌。
