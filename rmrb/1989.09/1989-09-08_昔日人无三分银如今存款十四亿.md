In the past, Guizhou, a remote and impoverished province, was known for having "not even three copper coins to one's name." Today, the average rural resident's savings have risen from a few fen in 1953 to 52 yuan.

Rural personal savings in Guizhou began in 1953. Currently, the province has 84 county-level (city-level) branches of the Agricultural Bank, 841 business outlets, and over 3,000 rural credit cooperatives. The establishment of rural financial institutions has contributed to the development of Guizhou's rural economy. Since 1979 alone, the Agricultural Bank has cumulatively issued 4.5 billion yuan in agricultural loans and 1.23 billion yuan in township enterprise loans. The total amount of rural savings in the province has increased from 30,000 yuan in 1953 to 1.4 billion yuan today.
