	We cannot deeply understand today without knowing the past. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the thoughts and topics of State Education Commission Vice Chairman He Dongchang span the 40-year span of New China's educational endeavors.

	Building the Largest Basic Education System in the World
	He Dongchang said that before liberation, except for the sparks in the liberated areas, the education system in the old China was semi-colonial and semi-feudal, and the working people were deprived of the right to education. After the founding of New China, the Party and the state formulated a series of policies, and the education system gradually shifted to serve socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is a fundamental change in the nature of our education, and it is the most important achievement in the field of education.

	With the development of socialist construction in our country, our educational undertakings have achieved tremendous success. From 40 years ago, when 80% of the population was illiterate, to now, when 97% of school-age children are enrolled in school, and primary education has been universalized in 80% of the country's population. He Dongchang said that education is constrained by economic development. Now, we can proudly say that among countries with the same level of economic development, our primary and secondary school universalization levels and the development speed of vocational and technical education are among the best.

	The difficulty in education lies in universal education. Even developed countries in the world find it difficult to achieve universal education. In a country with 1.1 billion people and extremely uneven development, this is even more the case. The difficulty in universal education in our country lies in rural areas, especially in sparsely populated, remote mountainous and pastoral areas. In other words, the fundamental problem of universal education in our country is the problem of rural education. It is very gratifying that after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the success of the first step of rural economic reform and the improvement of farmers' living standards, material conditions for universalizing rural education have been provided. In 1985, the Central Committee issued the "Decision on Educational System Reform," and primary and secondary schools implemented a new system of local responsibility and graded management, gradually shifting rural education to cultivating talents for local construction. This greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of all levels of government, especially the vast number of farmers, to run schools. In 1986, the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China" was promulgated, further bringing universal education into the legal track. He Dongchang believes that in the past 10 years, from the Central Committee to the grassroots party organizations, from state organs to local governments at all levels, the whole society's concern and support for the cause of education is unprecedented. It can be said that these 10 years are the fastest period of development for universal education in our country. The rapid development of rural general education has created favorable conditions for our country to complete the historical task of universal education.

	Before liberation, the highest year of educational development (1946) had 23.683 million primary school students and 1.496 million ordinary middle school students, with only about 5% of the population receiving education. Now, by the end of 1988, our country has 125.358 million primary school students and 47.615 million ordinary middle school students. Compared with the highest year before liberation, the number of primary school students has increased by 5.2 times, and the number of ordinary middle school students has increased by 30.8 times. The number of students in various types of schools has reached 21% of the population. According to statistics from 1988, the enrollment rate of primary school children in our country reached 97.15%, and the retention rate of students in school reached 96.9%. Except for cities, 1,326 counties have passed the inspection and acceptance of universal primary education by the provincial people's governments, accounting for about 66.8% of the total number of counties in the country. Many large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the surrounding rural areas, have universalized junior high school education.

	He Dongchang said that the teaching level of primary and secondary schools in various places in our country is still uneven and needs to be improved, but there are also some primary and secondary schools that are well-run. From 1986 to 1989, in the past four years, our country's middle school students participating in the international mathematics, physics, and chemistry competitions won 19 gold medals, 21 silver medals, and 14 bronze medals, which are remarkable achievements.

	Higher Education Adapting to Modernization
	He Dongchang has been engaged in higher education for many years. When talking about the changes in our country's higher education over the past 40 years, he is very familiar with the subject.

	In 1949, there were only 205 ordinary institutions of higher learning in the country, with 117,000 university students and 629 graduate students. By 1988, our country's ordinary institutions of higher learning had developed to 1,075, with 2.066 million university students and 100,800 graduate students, increasing by 4.2 times, 16.7 times, and 159.3 times respectively compared to 1949.

	Before liberation, our country's institutions of higher learning were not only few in number and small in scale, but also had backward equipment, incomplete majors, single training specifications, and weak scientific research capabilities, which are incomparable to today's institutions of higher learning. At the beginning of liberation, our country's institutions of higher learning had only 249 majors. By 1988, this had increased to 870. Before liberation, institutions of higher learning mainly cultivated undergraduates, and there were very few graduate students. Now, our country's higher education, according to the needs of socialist modernization construction, not only cultivates a large number of undergraduates but also sends a large number of specialized and graduate students to various fronts. By 1988, the number of professional points with the right to confer doctoral degrees nationwide had reached 1,830, and the number of professional points with the right to confer master's degrees had reached 6,407. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country's institutions of higher learning have, relying on their own strength, cultivated 110,148 master's degree students and 2,956 doctoral students. This marks that our country's institutions of higher learning have entered a new stage in cultivating high-level specialized talents.

	In the old China, among the 205 institutions of higher learning in the country, except for a few research projects such as mathematical deduction and biological classification, modern scientific and technological research was almost a blank. By 1988, our country's full-time ordinary colleges and universities engaged in scientific research had reached 800, with 189,700 people in the fields of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine engaged in scientific research and experimental development. In addition, there are 120,000 graduate students (including 10,000 doctoral students) participating in scientific research on the front line. The conditions for scientific research equipment have greatly improved. Especially in the past 10 years, in relevant institutions of higher learning, the state has invested heavily in building 36 open-type national key laboratories, further strengthening the basic research and applied research capabilities of institutions of higher learning, and improving the ability to cultivate high-level specialized talents. In the past 10 years, the projects awarded by the National Natural Science Award, Science and Technology Invention Award, and Science and Technology Progress Award have been won by institutions of higher learning, accounting for 47%, 27%, and 20% respectively.

	He Dongchang said that in the past 40 years, although our country's development of higher education has gone through a tortuous path, the achievements are remarkable. In terms of comparable cultural and scientific levels, our country's higher education is not only high in the Third World but also in the world. This is the advantage of our country's education. If we use history as a mirror, we can see our achievements more clearly.

	New Systems in Adult Education and Vocational Education Are Taking Shape
	He Dongchang fully affirms the rapid development of adult education and vocational education in recent years. In the old China, adult higher education was almost a blank. Now, there are 1,373 adult institutions of higher learning nationwide, with 1.093 million students. By 1988, the number of adult higher education students in our country had reached 1.7276 million, and the number of students taking the higher education self-study examination had reached more than 3 million. The number of students in adult secondary schools in our country reached 12.3111 million, with 11.8992 million graduates; the number of students in adult primary schools reached 16.0951 million, with 13.0584 million graduates. Adult education, mainly in the form of on-the-job training, is increasingly welcomed by factories, mines, enterprises, and the vast number of workers. In 1988, according to statistics from 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, 29% of workers had received on-the-job training.

	Before liberation, there were only 3 technical schools nationwide, with 27,000 students. There were 561 vocational schools (excluding normal schools), with 77,000 students. By 1988, our country's vocational secondary schools had developed to 2,957, with 1.3682 million students. There were 8,954 vocational high schools, with 2.7937 million students, and 119 vocational colleges, with 75,000 students. Vocational education has become an important part of the entire education system. The rapid development of adult education and vocational education has made our country's education structure increasingly rational. This is reflected in the most obvious way in the education structure of the high school stage in various provinces and cities in the eastern region of our country. The number of vocational and technical education personnel is equivalent to that of general education. Short-term vocational and technical education before and after junior high school graduation has also been widely carried out in recent years. The rationalization of the structure of secondary education is a prominent feature of education development in the past 10 years of reform.

	He Dongchang finally said to the reporter that when talking about the achievements of education in the past 40 years, we cannot avoid or ignore the mistakes in our work. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the biggest mistake in the past 10 years is the direction of education. The weakness of political and ideological work and the insufficient development of education are issues that we need to seriously think about. We seriously summarize the past and seriously think about the future, and we can confidently say that with the further implementation of the strategic position proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party and the full implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, our educational cause is full of hope.

    我国教育事业的崭新天地
　　——国家教委副主任何东昌谈新中国教育四十年
　　本报记者　陈兴贵
    不了解过去，就无法深刻了解今天。建国40周年前夕，国家教委副主任何东昌的思路和话题在新中国教育事业40年的跨度间驰骋。
    建成世界上最庞大的基础教育体系
    何东昌说，解放前的旧中国，除了解放区的星星之火以外，其时的教育是半殖民地半封建的教育，劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利。新中国成立后，党和国家制订了一系列方针政策，教育事业逐步转入为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的轨道，这是我国教育性质的根本性转变，是教育事业取得的一项最重要的成就。
    伴随着我国社会主义建设的发展，我国的教育事业取得了巨大的成就。我国从40年前人口中80％是文盲，到现在学龄儿童的97％已经入学，在占全国人口80％的地区普及了小学教育。何东昌说，教育要受经济发展的制约。现在，我们可以自豪地说，在同等的经济发展水平国家中，我国小学、中学的普及水平和职业技术教育的发展速度，都是名列前茅的。
    教育问题的难点在普及教育，即使世界上的发达国家也深感普及教育之难。在一个有11亿人口、发展极不平衡的国家中更是如此。我国普及教育的难点在农村，特别是在少数人口稀散、交通不便的深山区、牧区。换句话说，我国普及教育的根本问题是农村的教育问题。令人十分高兴的是，党的十一届三中全会以后，随着农村经济第一步改革的成功，农民生活水平的提高，为普及农村教育提供了物资条件。1985年，党中央作出了《关于教育体制改革的决定》，中小学实行地方负责、分级办学的新体制，把农村教育逐步转向为发展当地建设事业培养人才上。这就极大地调动了各级政府、特别是广大农民办学的积极性。1986年颁布了《中华人民共和国义务教育法》，使普及教育进一步纳入法制轨道。何东昌认为，这10年来，从党中央到基层党组织，从国家机关到各级地方政府，全社会对教育事业的关怀和支持是历史上没有过的。可以说这10年是我国普及教育发展最快的时期。农村普通教育的迅速发展，为我国完成普及教育的历史性任务创造了有利条件。
    解放前教育发展的最高年度（1946年），小学在校学生为2368.3万人；普通中学在校学生为149.6万人，受教育的人数只占人口的5％左右。而现在，截至1988年底的统计，我国的小学在校学生达12535.8万人；普通中学在校学生达4761.5万人。同解放前最高年度比，在校学生数小学增长5.2倍，普通中学增长30.8倍，各类学校的学生数已占人口的21％。据1988年统计，我国小学儿童入学率达到97.15％，在校学生的巩固率达到96.9％。除城市以外，已有1326个县通过了省级人民政府普及初等教育的检查验收，约占全国总县数的66.8％。京、津、沪等不少大中城市和周围农村，已普及了初中教育。
    何东昌说，我国各地的中小学教学水平不平衡，总的说仍然需要努力提高，但是也有一批中小学是办得比较好的。1986—1989年的4年间，我国中学生在参加国际数学、物理、化学三科奥林匹克竞赛中，获金牌19枚、银牌21枚、铜牌14枚，成绩是引人注目的。
    高等教育向适应现代化发展
    何东昌多年从事高等教育工作，谈起我国高教事业40年的变迁，如数家珍。
    1949年，全国普通高等学校只有205所，在校大学生为11.7万人，研究生为629人。到1988年，我国普通高等学校发展到1075所，在校大学生增加到206.6万人，研究生增加到10.08万人，分别比1949年增加4.2倍、16.7倍、159.3倍。
    解放前，我国高等学校不仅数量少、规模小，而且设备落后，专业残缺，培养规格单一，科研力量薄弱，与今天的高等院校不可同日而语。解放初我国高等学校仅设有249个专业，1988年，已增加到870个。解放前高等学校主要是培养本科生，培养研究生很少。现在，我国高等教育根据社会主义现代化建设的需要，不仅培养大批本科生，而且向各条战线输送了大批专科生和研究生。1988年，全国具有博士学位授予权的专业点已达1830个，具有硕士学位授予权的专业点达到6407个。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国高等学校依靠自己的力量，培养硕士研究生110148人，博士生2956人。这标志着我国高等学校在培养高级专门人才方面已进入了一个新的阶段。
    旧中国，在全国205所高等学校中，除数学推演、生物分类等屈指可数的研究工作外，现代科学技术的研究几乎是空白。到1988年，我国开展科研工作的全日制普通高校已达800所，理工农医学科从事科学研究与试验发展的就有189700人。另外，还有12万名在校研究生（包括1万名博士研究生）在科研第一线参与科研工作。科研设备和条件有了很大改观。特别是近10年来，在有关的高等学校，国家重点投资建设了36个开放型的国家重点实验室，进一步加强了高等学校基础研究和应用研究的手段，提高了培养高级专门人才的能力。近10年来，历届国家自然科学奖、科技发明奖和科技进步奖的获奖项目中，高等学校分别占47％、27％和20％。
    何东昌说，40年来我国发展高等教育中，尽管走过曲折的路，但取得的成绩是显著的。我国高等教育就其可比的文化科学水平来讲，不仅在第三世界中，就是在全世界讲，也是比较高的，这是我国教育的优势所在。如果用历史作一面镜子，对我国已经取得的成就会看得更清楚。
  成人教育和职业教育新体系正在形成
    对近些年得到蓬勃发展的成人教育和职业教育，何东昌给予充分的肯定。旧中国的成人高等教育，几乎是一片空白，如今全国有成人高等学校1373所，在校学生109.3万人。到1988年，我国成人高等学历教育在校生达172.76万人，高等教育自学考试在籍学生达300万人之多。我国成人中等学校在校生达1231.11万人，毕业1189.92万人；成人初等学校在校生达1609.51万人，毕业生1305.84万人。以岗位培训为主要形式的成人教育越来越受到厂矿企业和广大职工的欢迎。1988年，据27个省市自治区统计，接受岗位培训的职工已达29％。
    解放前，全国技工学校只有3所，在校生0.27万人。中等技术学校（不含中师）561所，在校学生7.7万人。到1988年，我国中等技校已发展到2957所，在校学生达136.82万人。职业中学8954所，在校学生279.37万人，职业大学119所，在校学生7.5万人。职业教育已成为整个教育系统的重要组成部分。成人教育和职业教育的蓬勃发展，使我国教育结构日趋合理化。这反映在我国东部地区各省市的高中阶段的教育结构最为明显，职业技术教育人数已与普通教育相当，初中毕业前后的短期职业技术教育近年来也有了广泛的开展。中等教育结构的趋向合理化，是十年来教育在改革中发展的一个明显的特点。
    何东昌最后对记者说，在谈到教育40年来取得的成绩时，也不能回避、不能忽视我们工作中的失误。邓小平同志指出，10年来最大的失误是教育方向。政治思想工作薄弱，教育事业发展不够，这是需要我们认真思考的。我们认真地总结过去，认真地思考未来，可以充满信心地说，随着党的十三大提出的战略地位的进一步落实和党的十三届四中全会精神的全面贯彻，我们的教育事业是大有希望的。
