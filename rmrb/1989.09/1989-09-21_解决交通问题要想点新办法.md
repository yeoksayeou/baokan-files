The problem of transportation has been around for a long time, but it has not been effectively solved, indicating that old ideas and methods are not working. We must deepen our reforms and change our mindset to explore new ways to address this issue:

Firstly, the development of transportation is a complex issue. We must have a national comprehensive department to organize the construction of a soft science team for transportation development issues. We should establish a foundation for transportation development research to ensure the research funds for the aforementioned professional team. On the basis of the transportation technology policies already issued and implemented by the state, we should continue to work deeply and not start new projects every time, conducting research for a while and then stopping.

Secondly, we must first clarify the situation of transportation in our country. Only by understanding the situation can we make decisions. In reality, there are many important aspects of the transportation situation in our country that are unclear. The total statistics of transportation volume and turnover volume contain significant differences from the actual amounts. The composition of transportation volume and turnover volume can be said to be basically unclear. These data are the premise for formulating a scientific and comprehensive transportation development strategy, policy, and guideline. Additionally, the evaluation methods and indicators for the comprehensive benefits of transportation are not yet scientifically and comprehensively defined. Some statements are not very scientific and seem plausible but are widely circulated. To be frank, if we cannot even distinguish between what is good and what is bad, how can we talk about solving problems? Why can't we distinguish? Apart from knowledge and experience, departmental interests and financial greed are also important reasons.

Thirdly, we must avoid confusing welfare with socialism and not turn the transportation industry into a welfare industry that relies on state subsidies to survive. On one hand, building roads, bridges, and airports requires investment from governments at all levels. As national infrastructure, who will manage it if the state does not? How can we change the current situation of no investment or insufficient investment? Where will the money come from? Primarily, it will come from various taxes and fees under the principle of beneficiary burden, as well as organizing the public to contribute labor, materials, and other forms of aid in lieu of taxes and fees. Why can't the methods used for water conservancy projects be applied to the construction of transportation infrastructure?

### 解决交通问题要想点新办法

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    解决交通问题要想点新办法
    中国汽车工业联合会信息部经理、研究员　张铮
    交通运输问题是老问题了，也老没解决好，可见用老观点、老办法不行，必须靠深化改革，转变观念来探讨解决问题的途径：
    第一点，交通运输发展问题很复杂，必须要有国家综合部门组织交通运输发展问题的软科学队伍建设；建立交通运输发展问题研究基金会，保证上述专业队伍的科研事业费用；在国家已经颁布实行的交通运输技术政策的基础上不断深入做工作，不要总是新起炉灶，研究一阵子，浅尝辄止。
    第二点，我国交通运输的状况首先得弄清楚，情况明才能下决心，实际上我国交通运输的状况有许多重要情况不清。运输量、周转量的总量统计包含的内容与实际发生的量有相当差距。而运量与周转量的构成则可以说基本不清楚。而这些资料是制订科学全面的交通运输发展战略、政策、方针的前提。另外，交通运输综合效益的评价方法、指标，至今没有个科学全面的说法，有些说法不很科学，似是而非而广为流传。说句坦率的话，连什么是好什么是坏都分不清，还谈什么解决问题？为什么分不清，除了知识、经验之外，部门利益、财迷心窍也是重要原因。
    第三，要避免把福利主义和社会主义混同起来，不能把交通运输业办成社会福利业，靠国家补贴过日子。一方面修路、造桥、建机场要靠各级政府投资，作为国家的基础设施，国家不管谁管？要改变目前不投资或投资不足的局面，钱从哪里来？主要是在受益者负担原则下的各种税、费，以及组织民众以工、以料代赈、代税、代费等办法。兴修水利的办法为什么不可以用来兴修交通运输基础设施？
