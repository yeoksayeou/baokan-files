Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th.

General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, today at the National Conference on Poverty Alleviation in Minority Areas, proposed to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and to do a good job in poverty alleviation in minority areas. This is of great significance for strengthening national unity, safeguarding national unity, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Jiang Zemin, in his speech, first expressed congratulations on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on the convening of this conference. He also extended cordial greetings to the broad cadres, masses, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life who have long been engaged in poverty alleviation work in minority areas and across the country.

This morning, Jiang Zemin, along with Qiao Shi, Tian Jiyun, Habib, Chen Junsheng, and Sima Yi·Aimaiti, held a discussion with representatives at the Beijing Western Guesthouse on how to promote the economic development of minority impoverished areas, quickly solve the problem of subsistence for the people in impoverished areas, and ultimately achieve prosperity.

At the discussion, Vice Chairman of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas Yang Yongzhe and Vice Chairman of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Zhao Yianian introduced the progress of China's poverty alleviation work and how to support and help the economic development of minority impoverished areas.

After listening to the reports, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the achievements made in recent years by shifting the focus of poverty alleviation work from simple relief to economic development. He pointed out that most impoverished areas are located in border regions and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, many of which are revolutionary old base areas. To achieve prosperity and solve the problem of subsistence for the people in ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, rely on their own strength, utilize local resources, and carry out economic development.

Jiang Zemin emphasized that the state and coastal, economically developed regions, and all sectors of society have the responsibility to help impoverished areas develop their economies and provide necessary support in terms of talent, technology, finance, and materials to promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. Ethnic minority areas should also strive to improve their cultural quality and, in combination with local conditions, work hard to develop production.

Jiang Zemin said that we must adhere to the maintenance of national unity and the great unity of all ethnic groups, and resolutely oppose separatism and turmoil. The 40-year practice since the founding of the People's Republic of China has proven that we have found our own path in ethnic work. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee opened a new era of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction in China, and also opened a new era in ethnic work. Over the past 10 years, the Party and the state have formulated a series of major policies for handling ethnic issues, which must be firmly implemented.

Jiang Zemin said that our country is a big family of multiple ethnic groups, and we must strengthen ethnic unity. To handle ethnic issues well, we must strengthen the rule of law and continuously improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy. The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is a scientific summary of China's implementation of the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and it must be seriously organized and implemented. Without a stable and united environment, we cannot talk about economic development, nor can we talk about poverty alleviation and prosperity.

Today's discussion was presided over by Sima Yi·Aimaiti, Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. Leaders from relevant departments of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council also attended the discussion.

    江泽民同有关会议代表座谈时指出
    发扬自力更生艰苦奋斗精神
    加快民族地区扶贫工作进程
    新华社北京9月20日电　（记者邹爱国、格来）中共中央总书记江泽民今天在全国少数民族地区扶贫工作会议上提出，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，做好少数民族地区扶贫工作，对加强民族团结，维护祖国统一，建设有中国特色的社会主义具有重大意义。
    江泽民在讲话中首先代表党中央、国务院对这次会议的召开表示祝贺，并向长期坚持在少数民族地区和全国扶贫工作第一线工作、战斗的广大干部、群众、人民解放军官兵以及社会各界人士表示亲切慰问。
    今天上午，江泽民和乔石、田纪云、习仲勋、陈俊生、司马义·艾买提等同志，在京西宾馆与代表们就如何推进少数民族贫困地区经济开发进程，尽快解决贫困地区群众温饱，进而脱贫致富等问题，进行了座谈。
    座谈会上，国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组副组长杨雍哲、国家民委副主任赵延年等同志先后介绍了我国扶贫工作进展情况和如何扶持帮助少数民族贫困地区发展经济等问题。
    江泽民在听取汇报后充分肯定了近几年扶贫工作由单纯生活救济转向经济开发的方针所取得的成绩。他指出，贫困地区大多分布在边疆地区和少数民族居住地，不少还是革命老根据地。少数民族地区要脱贫致富，尽早解决群众的温饱问题，首先应该发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，依靠自身的力量，利用本地资源，进行经济开发。
    江泽民强调说，国家和沿海地区、经济发达地区和社会各界都有责任帮助贫困地区发展经济，在人才、科技、财政、金融、物资等方面给予必要的支持，以促进各民族的共同繁荣。少数民族地区还要切实提高文化素质，结合本地的实际，努力发展生产。
    江泽民说，我们要坚持维护祖国统一和各民族的大团结，旗帜鲜明地反对分裂和动乱。中华人民共和国成立40年的实践证明，我们已经走出了有自己特色的民族工作的道路。党的十一届三中全会开辟了我国改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的新时期，同样也开辟了民族工作的新时期。10年来，党和国家制定了处理民族问题的一系列重大方针政策，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行。
    江泽民说，我们国家是一个多民族的大家庭，我们要加强民族团结。处理好民族问题，必须加强法制建设，不断完善民族区域自治制度。《民族区域自治法》是我国实行民族区域自治制度的科学总结，要认真组织实施。没有安定团结的环境和局面，就谈不上发展经济，也谈不上脱贫致富。
    今天的座谈会由国家民委主任司马义·艾买提主持。中共中央、国务院有关部门负责人也出席了座谈会。
