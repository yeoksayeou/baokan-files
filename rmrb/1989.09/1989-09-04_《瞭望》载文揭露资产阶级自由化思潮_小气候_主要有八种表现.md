Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 4th.

The upcoming issue of the "Outlook" weekly will publish an article titled "How to Understand the 'Small Climate'" by Zhang Guozhuo, which points out the eight manifestations of the "small climate."

The article states that after a heart-wrenching turmoil, people cannot help but ask: Why did a China that was thriving and full of hope suddenly change, leading to turmoil? Deng Xiaoping clearly answered this question: It is determined by the international climate and China's own "small climate." What is the "small climate"? It refers to the rampant bourgeois liberalization trend, whose main manifestations are:

	1.	Blatantly advocating extreme individualism. They advocate "individual supremacy," claiming that "selfishness is human nature and genes," and that "promoting selflessness will restrict human nature." They openly advocate "building a selfish and self-serving edifice, which has natural rationality."

	2.	Blatantly advocating materialism, advocating "everything for money." Under this ideological influence, many people, for the sake of money and personal or small group interests, disregard laws, disregard public morality, and disregard principles, losing national dignity and degrading personal dignity.

	3.	Using abstract concepts like "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" to advocate for bourgeois democracy and freedom, denying socialist democracy and freedom. They deny the democratic revolution and democratic construction achievements led by the Communist Party of China since the May Fourth Movement, openly advocating that "socialist China is also a country without democracy." They advocate for China's political system to follow the Western bourgeois "three powers separation," establishing so-called parliamentary democracy; they distort the "hundred flowers bloom, hundred schools contend" policy, denying the guiding role of Marxism, peddling bourgeois ideology; they advocate for bourgeois individualistic human rights, disregarding and trampling on the human rights of others in a socialist society, wantonly destroying socialist democratic legal system, advocating anarchism, and externally relying on foreign powers to exert pressure on our country.

	4.	Using the pretext of opposing feudal autocracy to oppose people's democratic dictatorship. They deliberately confuse the fundamental differences between socialism and feudalism, and between people's democratic dictatorship and feudal autocracy, claiming that people's democratic dictatorship is a "violent regime" that "punishes people for their words" and "violates human rights." At the same time, they vigorously advocate for bourgeois hypocritical, supra-class "humanitarianism," openly demanding the release of all "political prisoners."

	5.	Opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, advocating political pluralism, and demanding the implementation of Western bourgeois multiparty system, establishing an opposition party. They shout to "abolish the Communist Party's autocracy," clamor that "newspapers should not be the party's mouthpiece," and "workers should break away from the Communist Party's leadership."

	6.	Opposing the insistence on Marxism, openly advocating the "obsolete theory of Marxism." They advocate that "all three parts of Marxism are outdated and erroneous," asserting that "Marxism is useless in today's China," and that "the research method of Marxism is to derive erroneous results from correct principles." They claim that "Mao Zedong Thought must be thoroughly criticized."

	7.	Opposing the socialist system and beautifying the capitalist system. They advocate that "the attempt and failure of socialism is one of the two major legacies of the 20th century," and that "destruction relies on 'old horses,' and construction relies on 'capitalists.'" They advocate that "China's way out is capitalization," to legitimize private ownership, and to "ring the death knell of public ownership" as soon as possible.

	8.	Advocating national nihilism, advocating selling out the country, and advocating complete Westernization. A small number of people who vigorously advocate bourgeois liberalization beautify the barbaric invasion of imperialism, even hoping that China can be a colony for another 300 years. They vigorously denigrate and curse Chinese traditional culture, openly oppose the advocacy of patriotism, and believe that "China is insignificant," even believing that "the Chinese race is no good," and that "China is not to be liberated, but to be dissolved."

	In summary, it is not difficult to see that the "small climate," with the rampant bourgeois liberalization trend as its main content and characteristic, is fundamentally opposed to the fundamental principles of our country—the Four Cardinal Principles.

### 《瞭望》载文揭露资产阶级自由化思潮  “小气候”主要有八种表现

    《瞭望》载文揭露资产阶级自由化思潮
    “小气候”主要有八种表现
    新华社北京9月4日电  即将出版的《瞭望》周刊发表署名张国祚的文章《如何认识“小气候”》，指出“小气候”的八种表现。
    文章说，一场惊心动魄的风波平息了，人们不禁要问：一个蒸蒸日上、大有希望的中国，为什么会风云突变，发生动乱？邓小平同志明确地回答了这个问题：这是国际大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的。何谓小气候？就是指资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，其主要表现是：
      （1）露骨地宣扬极端个人主义。他们鼓吹“个人至上”，“自私是人的本性和基因”，认为“提倡大公无私会束缚人的本性”，“树立雷锋是历史上最大的错误”，公开宣扬
  “建设自私自利的大厦，具有天然的合理性”。
      （2）露骨地宣扬拜金主义，鼓吹“一切向钱看”。在这种思潮影响下，许多人为了金钱，为了个人或小团体的利益，而不顾法律、不讲公德、不要原则，丧失国格，辱没人格。
      （3）借讲抽象的“民主”、
  “自由”、“人权”鼓吹资产阶级的自由、民主观，否定社会主义自由、民主观。他们否定
  “五四”以来中国共产党所领导的民主革命的进程和民主建设的成果，公开宣扬“社会主义的中国同样是一个没有民主的国家”。主张中国政体效法西方资产阶级的“三权分立”，建立所谓议会制民主；他们歪曲
  “百家争鸣”的方针，否定马克思主义的指导地位，兜售资产阶级的意识形态；他们鼓吹资产阶级个人主义的人权，无视和践踏社会主义社会中他人的人权，肆意破坏社会主义的民主法制，奉行无政府主义，对外则仰仗洋人鼻息，对我国施加压力。
      （4）借口反对封建专制主义而反对人民民主专政。他们故意混淆社会主义与封建主义的根本区别、人民民主专政与封建专制主义的根本区别，宣称人民民主专政是“以言治罪”的“反人权”的“暴政”，与此同时又极力鼓吹资产阶级虚伪的、超阶级的“人道主义”，公开要求释放所有“政治犯”。
      （5）反对共产党的领导，鼓吹政治多元化，要求实行西方资产阶级的多党制，建立反对党。他们叫嚣要“取消共产党专制”，鼓噪“报纸不应成为党的喉舌”、“工人要脱离共产党的领导”。
      （6）反对坚持马克思主义，公开鼓吹马克思主义“过时论”。他们宣扬“马克思主义三个部分均已过时，而且错误”，断言“马克思主义在今日之中国没有用处”，“马克思主义的研究方法是从正确的原则出发，得出错误的结果”，声称“一定要彻底批判毛泽东思想”。
    （7）反对社会主义制度，美化资本主义制度。他们宣扬“社会主义的尝试及其失败，是20世纪人类的两大遗产之一”，“破坏靠‘老马’，建设靠‘走资’”。鼓吹“中国的出路是，资本主义化”，要为私有制正名，“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”。
      （8）宣扬民族虚无主义，鼓吹卖国主义，主张全盘西化。极少数卖力鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，美化帝国主义的野蛮侵略，甚至希望中国至少再当“300年殖民地”。他们极力贬低和诅咒中国传统文化，公然反对提爱国主义口号，认为“中国是微不足道的”，甚至认为
  “中国人种不行”，“中国不是要解放，而是要解散”。
    综上所述，不难看出，以资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥为主要内容和特征的“小气候”，是与我们的立国之本——四项基本原则根本对立的。
