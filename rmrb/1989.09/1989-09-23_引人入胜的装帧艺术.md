Recently, at the National Art Museum of China, I viewed the "Renyi, Zhang Shouyi, Chen Xin Book Design and Illustration Joint Exhibition." It was as if I suddenly saw a group of naturally beautiful young girls, and I couldn't help but want to look at them for a few more moments. Ah! So beautiful! The sea of books is full of beautiful designs. I am truly happy to see these three senior artists achieve new heights in the art of book design.

The artistic accomplishments of these three individuals are distinct. Some emphasize the effect of patterns, adorned with eye-catching details, expanding charm, and a single stroke that is astonishing. Some use black and white as the main elements, with a grand style, showcasing their brushwork skills, and vividly depicting the most captivating aspects. Others base their work on woodblock printing, using the knife as a brush, and capturing the essence with each stroke, expressing a sense of ink splashing freely. Each has their unique style, but they share a common trait: they closely follow the spirit of the original work for their conceptualization and composition. For example, Renyi's design for the book "Book Forest" uses books to form a full-page pattern. Due to the appropriate spacing, it is full yet not cluttered, creating a world of books, with the squeezed-out window displaying the title, which is both cleverly designed and meaningful. The design for the book "Beauty" uses red and black tones to convey a character "美" (beauty) that soars to the heavens. The image, though devoid of scenery or emotion, conveys a deep and pure artistic expression.

In a certain sense, book design is a form of "abstract" art, using the virtual to represent the real and the few to signify the many. It can be realistic, symbolic, or representational, but its purpose is to allow readers to immerse themselves in it, evoking boundless imagination. Zhang Shouyi has long been engaged in the design and illustration of foreign literature. His numerous works excel in black and white contrast, creating an artistic effect of paper turning into sculpture. For instance, the illustrations for "The Liberated Don Quixote," "War and Clouds," and "Crime and Punishment" not only have a rich texture but also demonstrate solid realistic skills. With a pen that replaces the real, he gives the viewer a sense of motion within stillness and stillness within motion. The design for the book "People, Years, Life" also prominently features black and white effects, composed of distinct color blocks, but like his illustrations, it possesses a unique artistic effect.

Regardless of how book designers showcase their talents, they must base their work on the content of the books. They cannot forget its subordinate nature; otherwise, it would lose its meaning. Of course, book design has its relatively independent language and form. For example, Chen Xin's works leave a vivid impression in this regard. "Novels and Novelists" is a design that combines the real and the virtual, with the design taking materials from the manuscript to form a three-dimensional pattern as the background, revealing a red rose that shines brightly throughout the room. His ingenuity lies in the study and carving of writers' portraits, such as his depictions of Mao Dun, Lao She, and Ding Ling in woodblock prints, which are lifelike and dazzling, with deep and subtle emotions, showcasing the skill of the knife and brush, as if they could be intricately decorated to achieve a colorful and unique style.

    引人入胜的装帧艺术
    叶然
    日前在中国美术馆观看了“任意·张守义·陈新书籍装帧、插图联展”，我好似猛然看到了不琢自美的一群少女，不由己的要多看上几眼。啊！好美呀！书海盛花美装多。我真高兴，看到了这三位老画家在装帧艺术方面取得的新成就。
    这三位的艺术造诣各有不同，有的注重图案效果，多饰夺目，拓出妩媚，一笔惊人；有的以黑白为主，气派不凡，朔笔功力，活画出动人之所在；有的则以版画为基础，以刀代笔，笔到神来，泼墨情致。真是各有各的个性，但他们有着共同的特点，紧紧依据原著精神进行构思构图。如任意的
  《书林》一书的装帧，以书组成满版图案，由于相间紧松得当，满而不繁，整个看来形成书的洞天，挤压出来的窗口托出书名，真是构思巧妙又有寓意。《美》一书的装帧，以红黑色调透出一个美字直耸云天，画面无景无情，却给人以情更深，意更纯的抒发殆尽的艺术感。
    装帧在一定意义上说是一种“抽象”的艺术，在表现上是以虚代实和以少胜多的，或写实，或写义，或象征，但其目的都是为了让读者神游其间，悠然而动遐想……张守义多年从事外国文学装帧和插图，那众多的作品都以黑白对比而见长，形成纸白成雕的艺术效果。如《解放了的堂·吉诃德》、《战争风云》、《罪与罚》等插图，不仅富有质感而且跃出扎实的写实功力，以虚代实的笔杆，给人以动中见静，静中有动之感。《人·岁月·生活》一书的装帧也同样显见于黑白效果，以色彩分明的色块组成，但也和他的插图一样具有独特的艺术效果。
    装帧艺术家无论怎样发挥自己的才能，都必须以书籍内容为依据，不能忘记它的从属性，如果离开了书籍总体内容，也就失去了存在的意义。当然装帧艺术，语言和形式又有它相对的独立体。如陈新的作品，在这方面给我们留有鲜明的印象。《小说与小说家》就是一本虚实并现的装帧，设计取材与以书稿组成立体图案衬底，浮现一朵红色玫瑰花，展露满堂生辉的艺术境界。他的匠心潜入的则是对作家肖像的研究和刻制，诸如他刻画的茅盾、老舍、丁玲等版画形象传神，令人眩目，情味深隐，刀笔见功，仿佛都能精工巧饰而达到色彩纷呈并具有自己特有的风格。
