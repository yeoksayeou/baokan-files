    Minister of Public Security Wang Fang emphasized that to build a revolutionary, modern, and regularized police force with high combat effectiveness, it is essential to strengthen and improve ideological and political work.

    Wang Fang said, the Public Security organs are tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. This nature determines that public security personnel must establish a communist worldview and learn to observe and analyze problems from the standpoint, viewpoint, and methods of dialectical and historical materialism. He believes that in recent years, the social trend of "everything for money" and bourgeois liberalization have had an impact on the public security forces, and the existence of some lawless and disorderly behavior among a small number of personnel is due to the fact that some people have not truly established a communist worldview. Therefore, in the future, we should focus on cultivating a firm communist worldview among the broad masses of public security personnel and armed police.

    Wang Fang required that all levels of public security organs should implement ideological and political work at the grassroots level, where 70-80% of the police force is stationed. Efforts should be made to strengthen the construction of grassroots stations and teams, especially the construction of party branches, to make grassroots party branches truly become strong battle fortresses.

    It is understood that from the Fifth Public Security Political Work Conference in 1984 to 1988, a total of 663 public security personnel died in the line of duty, and 10,264 were injured. In the struggle, a large number of advanced individuals and collectives emerged. From 1984 to 1988, 85 personnel were awarded first and second-class model titles, and nearly 40,000 individuals and 1,207 collectives were awarded first, second, and third-class meritorious service medals. Especially in this struggle to suppress the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, in the face of extremely sharp and complex situations, the broad masses of personnel remained politically firm in their alignment with the Party Central Committee, and clearly opposed the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion.

    公安部长王芳强调
    加强和改进公安机关思想政治工作
    据新华社北京9月8日电  （记者周立宪）国务委员、公安部长王芳在今天结束的全国公安政治工作座谈会上强调，造就一支革命化、现代化、正规化的，有高度战斗力的人民警察队伍，必须切实加强和改进思想政治工作。
    王芳说，公安机关是人民民主专政的工具，这一性质决定公安干警必须树立共产主义世界观，学会以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的立场、观点、方法观察问题，分析解决问题。他认为这些年社会上“一切向钱看”的歪风、资产阶级自由化思想对公安队伍的冲击，以及少部分干警的违法乱纪现象的存在，是一部分人共产主义世界观还没有真正树立起来。所以，今后应该把培养广大公安干警、武警坚定地树立共产主义世界观，作为公安思想政治工作的根本任务。
    王芳要求各级公安机关要把思想政治工作落实到警力占七八十的基层，切实加强基层所、队的建设，特别是党支部的建设，使基层党支部真正成为坚强的战斗堡垒。
    据了解，从1984年第五次公安政工会议以来到1988年，全国公安队伍共有663名干警因公殉职，有10264人因公负伤。在斗争中涌现出大批先进个人和集体，在1984年至1988年这5年中，有85名干警被授予一、二级英模称号，有近4万人和1207个集体荣立一、二、三等功。特别是在这次平暴制乱斗争中，面对极其尖锐、复杂的形势，广大干警在政治上坚定地同党中央保持一致，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱和反革命暴乱。
