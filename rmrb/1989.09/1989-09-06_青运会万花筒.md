At the opening ceremony, as athletes from various teams entered the stadium, many delegations displayed banners with celebratory and greeting messages. Among them, the banner held by the Shandong delegation, "Greetings to our fellow countrymen!" seemed to be the most popular, drawing sustained applause from the over 60,000 spectators. Some even started banging drums to show their appreciation for the Shandong team. A female college student wearing a straw hat said, "This banner is very heartwarming. In Liaoning Province, nearly half of the population are descendants of Shandong immigrants."

Among the numerous sports venues for the Youth Games, there is a gymnasium built by the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau with funds amounting to 15 million yuan, named "Electric Power Gymnasium." It is located in the bustling city center, and the women's basketball matches of the Youth Games are scheduled to be held here. After the games, it will serve as a sports and cultural recreation center for electric power workers. The completion of the Electric Power Gymnasium demonstrates the advantages of socialized sports.

    青运会万花筒
    ▲开幕式上，当各路体育健儿入场时，许多代表团都打出了欢庆和问候的标语。其中山东代表团高举的“向老乡们问好！”标语，似乎最受欢迎，全场六万多名观众爆发出经久不息的掌声；有人还敲起了锣鼓，向山东队致意。一位戴草帽的女大学生说：“这条标语蛮有人情味，在辽宁省的人口中，有差不多一大半儿是山东移民的后裔。”
    ▲在青运会众多的体育场馆中，有一座沈阳市电业局自筹一千五百万元兴建的体育馆，取名为“电业体育馆”。它座落在繁华市区，青运会女子篮球赛安排在这里进行。赛后它将成为电业职工体育文化娱乐场所。电业体育馆的建成，显示出体育社会化的优势。
