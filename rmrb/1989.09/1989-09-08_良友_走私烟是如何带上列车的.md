On August 6th, our bureau's patrol police squad received a tip from the public that the 295/298 train from Nanning to Chongqing had a large quantity of foreign cigarettes on board. The patrol police squad immediately organized officers to board the train in Guiyang for inspection. In the restroom of Carriage 8, officers discovered that the top inspection cover had two large latches and two bolts screwed on the outside. Upon opening it, nearly 300 cartons of "Liangyou" cigarettes were found inside. Subsequently, officers found another 400 cartons of "Liangyou" cigarettes in the ceiling compartments of two other carriages. These covers had also been specially modified. Upon investigation, it was found that this batch of cigarettes was all smuggled foreign cigarettes, valued at over 30,000 yuan. After the cigarettes were discovered, several staff members on the train repeatedly pleaded with the patrol police to return the cigarettes, but the police adhered to the principles and handed over all the cigarettes to the Zunyi City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau for processing. It is understood that since this year, our bureau's patrol police squad has repeatedly seized large quantities of foreign cigarettes on this train.

    “良友”走私烟是如何带上列车的
    8月6日，我局巡警队得到群众举报，当日南宁开往重庆的295／298次列车上装有大量外烟。巡警队立即组织干警在贵阳登车进行清查，在8号车厢厕所，干警发现顶部检修孔盖板上装了两个大插销，盖板外面还拧上了两颗螺栓。打开一看，里边有近300条“良友”烟。接着，干警又在另两个车厢顶部起获了400条“良友”烟。这两个车厢盖板同样是经过特殊加工的。经查，这批香烟全是走私的外烟，价值3万多元。香烟查出后，车上几名工作人员反复向巡警说情，要求归还香烟，巡警坚持原则，将烟全部移交遵义市烟草专卖局处理。据了解，今年以来，我局巡警队在这次列车上，多次查获私带的大量外烟。
