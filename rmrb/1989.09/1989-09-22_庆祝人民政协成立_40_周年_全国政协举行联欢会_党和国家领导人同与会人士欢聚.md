Forty years ago today, the People's Political Consultative Conference was formally established in Beiping. Since then, it has become an organization led by the Communist Party of China, comprising members from various democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, and patriots from all walks of life, including all socialist laborers and patriots who support national unity. It has become an important channel for promoting socialist democracy within China's political system and a crucial form of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Today, the National People's Political Consultative Conference Hall in Beijing was adorned with lights and decorations, filled with laughter and joy. At 3 PM, Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National People's Political Consultative Conference, along with party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, and Wang Zhen, arrived at the first meeting room to cordially meet with former vice chairmen of the National People's Political Consultative Conference and took a group photo with them. After the meeting, the central leaders enthusiastically viewed an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by former members of the Political Consultative Conference. At 3:30 PM, the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference began with a performance by artists from the capital. The central leaders and attendees enjoyed the wonderful performance together.

Today's celebration activities were held in the spirit of thrift, avoiding large banquets and grand events. The gifts given to the guests were commemorative envelopes marking the 40th anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference. Although the celebration was modest, it was filled with a warm atmosphere. In addition to the calligraphy and painting exhibition, there were also dance parties, chess, bridge, billiards, and book readings.
