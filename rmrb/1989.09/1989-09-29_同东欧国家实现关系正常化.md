From June 4 to 21, 1987, Chinese leaders visited Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, five Eastern European socialist countries. Prior to this, the leaders of these five countries had visited China. Through a series of high-level mutual visits, China and the five Eastern European countries achieved a comprehensive normalization of state relations, and the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the parties of the five countries has also been restored.

Since the early 1960s, relations between China and the five Eastern European countries had deteriorated to a low level. Since the 1980s, China's relations with these countries have gradually improved and developed smoothly. Trade volume has increased significantly, and scientific and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges have also developed. Since 1985, political exchanges between the two sides have increased, and the level of exchanges has gradually improved. The mutual visits of leaders between China and Eastern European countries have turned a new page in China's relations with the five Eastern European countries. China and the Eastern European countries have signed ten bilateral cooperation documents, including agreements on the basic direction of economic and technological cooperation, avoidance of double taxation, cultural and scientific cooperation, and mutual visa exemption.

    同东欧国家实现关系正常化
    一九八七年六月四日至二十一日，中国领导人访问了波兰、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和保加利亚五个东欧社会主义国家。在此之前，这五国的领导人先后访问了中国。通过一系列的高级互访，中国与东欧五国实现了国家关系的全面正常化，中国共产党与五国党的关系也已恢复。
    自六十年代初开始，中国与东欧五国的关系曾降到低水平。八十年代以来，中国同这些国家的关系逐步改善，发展比较顺利。贸易额大幅度增长，科技合作和文化交流也有发展。自一九八五年起，彼此政治交往增加，级别逐年提高。中国和东欧国家领导人的互访，使中国同东欧五国的关系掀开了新的一页。我国与东欧五国共签署了关于经济和科技合作基本方向的协定、避免双重征税协定、文化科学和教育合作协定、互免签证协定等十个双边合作文件。
