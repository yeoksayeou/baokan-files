    Hunan Province Removes Illegal Road Checkpoints

    Our reporter Du Ruoyuan reports from Changsha: Hunan Province has begun to rectify various types of road checkpoints, removing illegal barriers, and ensuring smooth traffic and road safety.

    For a period of time, some places in Hunan Province have had numerous checkpoints on their roads, with rampant illegal collections and fines, artificially exacerbating the difficulties of travel and fostering a corrupt environment.

    Recently, the Hunan Provincial People's Government decided that on national highways, provincial roads, and other major transportation routes, the public security authorities will take the lead in setting up unified road checkpoints. Other local and departmental checkpoints will be abolished.

    湖南省撤销违章路卡
    本报长沙9月24日电　记者杜若原报道：湖南省开始整顿各类公路检查站，撤销违章关卡，保证道路畅通和交通安全。
    一段时期以来，湖南省一些地方的公路上关卡林立，乱收费、滥罚款现象十分严重，人为地加剧了行车难，助长了腐败之风。
    湖南省人民政府最近决定，国道、省道等交通干线，由公安机关为主统一设置公路联合检查站，其它地方和部门自行设立的检查站一律撤销。
