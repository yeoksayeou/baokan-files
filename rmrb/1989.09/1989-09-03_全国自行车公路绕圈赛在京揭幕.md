A type of outdoor road cycling race popular in Europe and America began today for the first time in China, the "bicycle kingdom." Nearly 100 athletes competed in a 70-kilometer, 14-lap race at the Laoshan Motorcycle Training Ground in Beijing's western suburbs, marking the start of this major cycling event.

The Changcheng-Xianjing Cup Cycling Race will last nearly two months, with preliminary rounds in Beijing, Harbin, Dalian, Shanghai, Jinan, Tianjin, and Taiyuan. The top six finishers from each preliminary round will advance to the final on October 22 in Beijing. The top six finishers in today's first preliminary round were all from Beijing: Tang Xuezhong, Jiang Xuehua, Wang Cong, Xiao Yong, Liu Yajun, and Liu Xudong.

In addition to the Beijing team, today's competition included amateur cyclists from Shijingshan District, Haidian District, Miyun County, Huairou County, Shunyi County, Changping County, Tong County, and the Beijing Municipal Cycling Association. Nearly 50-year-old Zhang Lihua, vice-chairman of the Chinese Cycling Association, also completed the entire course and won the style award.

This type of cycling race not only rewards the final results but also gives awards for each lap, increasing the intensity of the competition. However, due to the steep slopes and sharp turns in today's course, with a maximum slope of 40 degrees, and each lap being 5 kilometers, there were not many frequent single-lap sprints to create exciting moments.

    全国自行车公路绕圈赛在京揭幕
    本报北京9月3日讯　记者温子建报道：一种流行于欧美的自行车室外公路绕圈赛，今天首次在中国这个自行车王国开始举行。在北京西郊的老山摩托车训练场，近百名选手于上午9时进行了赛程70公里、共14圈的角逐，揭开本次自行车大赛的序幕。
    长城——鲜京杯自行车赛将历时近两个月，分别先在北京、哈尔滨、大连、上海、济南、天津和太原进行7场预赛，每次预赛的前6名最后于10月22日在北京进行决赛。获得今天第一场预赛前6名的均为北京选手，他们依次是汤学忠、姜学华、王琮、肖勇、刘亚军和刘旭东。
    参加今天比赛的除北京队外，还有石景山区、海淀区、密云县、怀柔县、顺义县、昌平县、通县和北京市自行车协会的业余选手，年近五旬的中国自行车协会副主席张立华也坚持骑完了全程，获得风格奖。
    这种自行车绕圈赛除了计最后成绩外，还对每一圈成绩给予奖励，这就增加了比赛激烈程度。但由于今天的赛程坡陡弯急，最大坡度达40度，每圈5公里的赛程又稍嫌长，因此未能频繁出现单圈冲刺的精彩场面。
