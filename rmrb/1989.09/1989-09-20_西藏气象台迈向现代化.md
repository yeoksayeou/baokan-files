Tibet Meteorological Bureau Moves Towards Modernization
Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 19th - Correspondent Liu Wei reports: The modernization of Tibet's meteorological services, marked primarily by the application of computers, has begun to take shape.

Since the satellite communication line between Lhasa and Beijing was opened in 1986, the Tibet Meteorological Bureau has established a satellite digital image processing system and an automated charting system this August, and now possesses multiple microcomputers. The initial formation of a comprehensive meteorological network across Tibet has been achieved, and business operations have evolved from the initial single weather observation tasks to the current five major systems: atmospheric detection, communication transmission, data processing, weather forecasting, and meteorological services.
