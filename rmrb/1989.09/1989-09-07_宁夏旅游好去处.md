Ningxia is home to several popular tourist destinations. One of the most notable is Shapotou, located approximately 10 kilometers from the city of Zhongwei. Shapotou is renowned for its impressive sand control achievements, attracting numerous domestic and international tourists and researchers. In the 1950s, the construction of the Baolan Railway involved the train crossing the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert six times near Zhongwei. Thanks to effective sand control measures, the railway has operated smoothly for over 30 years, garnering global attention.

Shapotou is situated along the banks of the Yellow River, with sand dunes reaching heights of over 80 meters in a crescent shape. Visitors can slide down the sand dunes, experiencing a unique "singing sand" phenomenon where the sand emits a humming sound, reminiscent of a bell ringing, hence the name "Shapotou Bell Ringing."

Another must-visit site is the Western Xia Imperial Tombs, located on the gentle slopes of the Helan Mountains to the west of Yinchuan. Within this vast necropolis, spanning 10 kilometers north to south and 4 kilometers east to west, lie the tombs of eight Western Xia emperors and over 70 accompanying tombs of officials and nobles. Historical records indicate that each tomb originally featured structures such as corner towers, stele pavilions, offering halls, and pagoda-style spirit platforms. Excavations have revealed Western Xia and Han script stele fragments, gold ornaments, gilded silver ornaments, bamboo carvings, bronze armor plates, pearls, and other burial artifacts.

    宁夏旅游好去处
    沙坡头　沙坡头自然风景区距中卫县城约10公里，以其丰硕的治沙成果吸引着许多中外游客和考察者。50年代修建的包兰铁路，在中卫一带6次穿越腾格里沙漠的东南缘。由于治沙有方，30年来，火车畅通无阻，震惊世界。
    沙坡头濒临黄河岸边，沙丘高达80多米，呈月牙状。游人从沙丘上向下坐滑，沙中会发出嗡嗡之声，酷似钟鸣，故有“沙坡鸣钟”之说。
    西夏王陵　西夏王陵墓区位于银川西部贺兰山东麓的平缓坡地上。在南北长10公里、东西宽4公里的宏大陵园中，建造着8座西夏国历代帝王陵园和70余座官僚勋戚的陪葬墓。据记载，原来每个陵园均由角楼、碑亭、献殿、塔式灵台等建筑组成。从已发掘的帝陵和陪葬墓中，出土了西夏文和汉文残碑、金饰品、鎏金银饰品、竹雕、铜甲片、珍珠等陪葬品。　（竺　人）
