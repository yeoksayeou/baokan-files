The decade of reform and opening up has seen tremendous development in the productive forces of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. In 1988, compared to 1978, the gross national product increased by 2.1 times, the total agricultural output value increased by 1.29 times, and the total industrial output value increased by 2.74 times. Currently, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Corps accounts for 1/5 of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire autonomous region.

The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, with its glorious revolutionary tradition of Nanluwan, has struggled for decades in the Gobi deserts of the Tianshan Mountains, establishing 171 mechanized agricultural and pastoral farms and over 300 independent accounting industrial, commercial, construction, and transportation enterprises. This has formed a relatively complete economic system. Today, it has developed into a socialist united body with a total population of over 2 million, integrating party, government, and military affairs, and combining agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and military affairs, with comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Compared to 1954, when the Corps was established, the total agricultural output value in 1988 increased by 36.5 times, with grain increasing by 17.3 times, cotton by 55.6 times, oil crops by 42 times, and the number of livestock at the end of the year increasing by 5.3 times. The total industrial output value increased by 42.1 times. The Corps' various crop yields currently account for the following proportions of the autonomous region: grain 21.7%, cotton 38.5%, sugar crops 46.8%, and oil crops 23.5%. Many industrial products have become pillar products of the autonomous region, with cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wool, wool yarn, machine-made thread, sugar, and other products accounting for more than 30% of Xinjiang's production. These have made important contributions to supporting the country's socialist construction.

    发扬南泥湾精神　坚持改革开放方针
    建设兵团功垂天山
    改革开放10年，新疆生产建设兵团的生产力获得了巨大发展。1988年与1978年相比，国民生产总值增长2.1倍，农业总产值增长1.29倍，工业总产值增长2.74倍。目前，兵团工农业总产值已占全自治区工农业总产值的1／5。
    具有南泥湾光荣革命传统的新疆生产建设兵团，艰苦奋斗数十年，在天山南北的戈壁荒原建起了171个机械化农牧团场和300余个独立核算的工交商建企业，形成了比较完整的经济体系。今天，它已发展成为拥有总人口200余万，党政军合一、农工商学兵结合、农林牧副渔全面发展的社会主义的联合体。1988年与兵团成立时的1954年相比，农业总产值增长36.5倍，其中粮食增长17.3倍，棉花增长55.6倍，油料增长42倍，牲畜年末保留头数增长5.3倍；工业总产值增长42.1倍。兵团各种农作物产量目前分别占自治区的比重为：粮食21.7％，棉花38.5％，糖料46.8％，油料23.5％。很多工业产品成为自治区的支柱产品，水泥、棉纱、棉布、呢绒、毛线、机制线、糖等数10种产品占新疆30％以上，对支援国家的社会主义建设作出了重要贡献。
