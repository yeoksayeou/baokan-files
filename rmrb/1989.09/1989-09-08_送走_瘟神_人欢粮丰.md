One of the key grain-producing counties in the nation, Jiaxian, ended the history of "fields without tillers" after liberation. Over the past 40 years, the commercial grain it has provided could feed the residents of Beijing for five years...

The 500-plus square kilometers of fertile land in Jiaxian, Zhejiang, is a land of fish and rice in the Hangjiahu Plain, known as "Silver Jiaxian" by the people.

However, this water town was once a place where schistosomiasis flourished. From the War of Resistance to the eve of liberation, in just 10 years, this small county saw 17,000 people die from schistosomiasis.

Medical teams and work groups that came with the People's Liberation Army, after years of effort, finally eradicated schistosomiasis. When talking about the movie "Gnarled Tree in Spring," the people of Jiaxian easily become emotional. Many people may still remember a photograph of a frail girl with a swollen belly, named Lou Yumei. She is now living a happy life in the suburbs of Jiaxing. How many "Lou Yumei" were there in Jiaxian back then, escaping death by the skin of their teeth! In the early 1960s, many young men from here were rejected from military service due to enlarged livers and spleens. For a few years, the higher authorities simply exempted the entire county from conscription. But now, this place has become a model county for military recruitment, continuously providing pilots for several years. Hongxi Township, which once suffered greatly from the plague, is now a model unit for rural sports in the nation. This year, it will also host the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai farmers' basketball invitational tournament!

Ten years of reform have given the people of Jiaxian a second liberation, allowing their wisdom and talents to be further unleashed. Here, the nation's earliest and most complete agricultural development fund system has been established, with various industries supporting agriculture becoming the norm; here, the seed coverage rate reaches 98%, and a healthy three-tier breeding and promotion system makes Jiaxian's seeds famous far and wide; here, every township has motorized dredging ships, and the use of farmyard manure has never been neglected. The people of Jiaxian are also good at diversified operations, growing watermelons that are both sweet and large; growing vegetables that are both fresh and tender. After just a few years of growing autumn tomatoes, even some agricultural experts from the provincial capital come here to "learn." Fish farming in Neiting achieves a yield of over 600 kilograms per mu, and many of the freshwater fish eaten by the residents of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai come from Jiaxian's water town. Taking advantage of its geographical proximity to Shanghai, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, township enterprises have sprung up one after another, with a total output value exceeding 260 million yuan last year. With the economy developing, the lives of the people of Jiaxian have also improved. In the 1950s, they lived in thatched huts; in the 1970s, they lived in flat-roofed houses; in the 1980s, they moved into new buildings, with an average annual income of over 1,100 yuan for farmers.

One harvest for every seed sown. The people of Jiaxian provide the nation with 100 million kilograms of commercial grain each year. For every 500 kilograms of grain procurement task in the nation, 1 kilogram is provided by the people of Jiaxian. Over the past 40 years, they have cumulatively provided over 3.6 billion kilograms of commercial grain, enough to feed the current residents of Beijing for five years.

### 送走“瘟神”  人欢粮丰

    全国重点产粮县之一的嘉善，解放后结束了“有田无人耕”的历史，40年来提供的商品粮可供北京市区居民吃5年……
    送走“瘟神”  人欢粮丰
  浙江嘉善500多平方公里的沃土，是杭嘉湖平原上的鱼米之乡，被人们誉为“银嘉善”。
    然而，这水乡过去却成为血吸虫病滋生蔓延的地方。从抗战到解放前夕的短短10年间，这个小县竟有17000多人死于血吸虫病。
    随解放大军而来的医疗队、工作组，经过多年的努力，终于根治了血吸虫病。说起《枯木逢春》那部电影，嘉善人就很容易动感情。很多人也许还记得一张照片，那照片上一位骨瘦如柴却挺着大肚皮的小女孩，她叫娄玉妹，如今幸福地生活在嘉兴市郊区。那时的嘉善有多少这样死里逃生的“娄玉妹”啊！60年代初，这里的应征入伍青年常因肝脾肿大而被退回，有几年上级干脆对全县作免征处理。可如今，这里成了全国征兵工作先进县，还连续几年输送了飞行员。过去深受瘟疫之苦的洪溪乡，今天也成了全国农村群众体育的先进单位，今年还要承办江浙沪的农民篮球邀请赛呢！
    10年改革使嘉善人获得了第二次解放，他们的聪明才智得到了进一步的发挥。这里，建立了全国最早最完善的农业发展基金制度，各行各业支持农业蔚然成风；这里，良种覆盖率达到98％，健全的三级繁育推广体系使嘉善良种远近闻名；这里，乡乡都有机动吸泥船，农家肥的投入从来没有被冷落。嘉善人还善于多种经营，种西瓜，西瓜又甜又大；种蔬菜，蔬菜又鲜又嫩。秋番茄这里不过种了几年，可如今连省城的一些农业专家也要来这儿“取经”。内塘养鱼，亩产高达600多公斤，京、津、沪的市民吃的淡水鱼，有不少就出自嘉善水乡。这里利用紧邻沪嘉杭的地理优势，一家家的乡镇企业办了起来，去年总产值超过2.6亿元。经济发展了，嘉善人生活也好了。50年代住草棚，70年代住平屋，80年代住上新楼房，农民人均年收入达到了1100多元。
    一分耕耘一分收获。嘉善人每年为国家提供的商品粮达1亿公斤，全国每500公斤粮食定购任务中就有1公斤是嘉善人提供的。40年来，他们累计提供商品粮超过36亿公斤，可供北京市区的现有居民吃上5年。
