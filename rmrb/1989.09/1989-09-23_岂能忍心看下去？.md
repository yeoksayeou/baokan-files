How Can One Bear to Watch This?

	Stealing Reinforcement Bars

The Datong to Yuncheng second-class highway, which is currently under construction and spans the province from south to north, is being damaged even as it is being built. In the vicinity of Dongyulin Village and the newly constructed road bridge in Dafuzhuang Village north of Shuozhou City, the guardrails have been smashed (see left image). In this 10-kilometer section alone, six bridges have damaged guardrails. Such acts of stealing reinforcement bars and damaging highway bridge guardrails frequently occur within Shuozhou City. Relevant departments in Shuozhou City have a responsibility to address this issue and assist the construction unit in repairing this road.

	Destroying Bridge Railings

In the 22nd kilometer of the Chengwan line of the provincial highway trunk line in Pingba Township, Chengkou County, Sichuan Province, the guardrails installed two years ago have been stolen and damaged by those stealing reinforcement bars, and some of the frames have collapsed due to lack of support, affecting the safety of vehicles and pedestrians (see right image). This illegal act has not been investigated to this day.

    岂能忍心看下去？
        盗钢筋
    正在加紧施工的横贯我省南北的大同至运城二级公路，一边施工，一边遭到破坏。在朔州市境内东榆林村附近和大夫庄村北新修的公路桥的扶手栏杆被砸（下左图），仅在这十公里长的路段，就有六座桥梁栏杆残缺不全。这种为盗钢筋而破坏公路桥梁栏杆的行为在朔州市境内时有发生。朔州市有关部门有责任过问此事，协助施工单位修好这条公路。

    毁桥栏
    我省公路干线放射线城万线公路二十二公里处的城口县坪坝乡境内，前年装好的公路桥栏杆被盗窃钢筋的人砸坏，部分框架也因失去支撑而垮塌，影响到行车和行人的安全（下右图）。这一违法行为，至今未受到追查。
