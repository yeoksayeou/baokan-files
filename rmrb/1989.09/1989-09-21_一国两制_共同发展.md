The 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching, and I would like to extend my festive greetings to all compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau who care about and love our motherland.

After the founding of New China, the Chinese government has repeatedly declared that Hong Kong and Macau are Chinese territories. The Chinese people do not recognize the series of unequal treaties imposed on China by foreign powers. The Chinese government advocates for resolving this historical issue through negotiations when the time is ripe. For a long time, the Chinese government has adopted policies that are conducive to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. In particular, the mainland has provided a large amount of food, daily necessities, fresh water, and industrial raw materials at preferential prices, ensuring the economic development of Hong Kong and Macau. Over the decades, regardless of the situation in the mainland or the difficulties it has encountered, this policy has remained unchanged.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, our country entered a new historical period. Achieving national reunification is one of the three major tasks of the Chinese people in this new historical period, and the recovery of Hong Kong and Macau and the resumption of sovereignty are important components of the great cause of national reunification. As 1997 approaches, the time to resolve the Hong Kong issue is ripe. The Chinese government, based on Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems," has formulated a series of special policies to resolve the Hong Kong and Macau issues. Through negotiations with the British and Portuguese governments, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau were signed, deciding that China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and over Macau on December 20, 1999.

The resolution of the Hong Kong and Macau issues has taken a significant step forward in the process of achieving national reunification. At the same time, it has also provided new lessons for countries in resolving historical issues.

The series of policies formulated by the Chinese government based on the concept of "one country, two systems" are based on the history and current situation of Hong Kong and Macau. They uphold the principle of national sovereignty while ensuring the continued prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau, taking into account the interests of all parties, and have been supported by the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau and praised by the international community. The Chinese government's policies toward Hong Kong and Macau have been specifically reflected in the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese joint declarations. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region, which are currently being drafted, will codify these policies into law and ensure they remain unchanged for 50 years.

In recent times, some people in Hong Kong and Macau have expressed doubts about whether the Chinese government can continue to implement its policies on Hong Kong and Macau. Regarding this issue, on June 22 of this year, I already made a solemn declaration on behalf of the Chinese government. Now, I would like to reiterate: The series of policies formulated by the Chinese government based on the concept of "one country, two systems" for Hong Kong and Macau will not change. The Chinese government will steadfastly adhere to the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau. Our policies will not change because the concept of "one country, two systems" is not a temporary measure but a major strategic decision. Implementing this decision is beneficial for achieving national reunification through peaceful means, for maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macau, for relevant countries to maintain and develop their legitimate interests in Hong Kong and Macau, and for safeguarding world peace. This decision, which fully takes into account the actual situation and the interests of all parties, is completely correct, feasible, and has no reason to change.

Whether it is the current transitional period or after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau, the capitalist system different from the socialist system of the mainland will be implemented in the Hong Kong and Macau regions. In handling the relationship between the two places, I hope that, economically, the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau will each play to their strengths, work together, and achieve mutual benefit and common development. Politically, the mainland acknowledges the long-term existence of the capitalist system in Hong Kong and Macau and will not impose the socialist system and policies on Hong Kong and Macau; Hong Kong and Macau should also respect the socialist system of the mainland and not interfere with or attempt to change the socialist system of the mainland, nor allow anyone to use Hong Kong and Macau as a base to subvert the central government. People from the mainland going to Hong Kong and Macau should abide by the laws of Hong Kong and Macau; compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau returning to the mainland should also abide by the Constitution and laws of the country, safeguard national sovereignty and unity. In short, the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau should seek unity in the country and diversity in the systems, complement each other, and develop together.

The practice over the past 40 years of liberation has proven that Hong Kong and Macau have a relationship of shared fate and prosperity with the mainland. The stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macau are conducive to the socialist modernization of the motherland; the strength of the motherland is a reliable guarantee for the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macau. With the deepening development of reform, opening up, and construction in the mainland, the economic cooperation between Hong Kong and Macau and the mainland will surely achieve comprehensive and vigorous development. I believe that, through the joint efforts of the people of Hong Kong and Macau and the mainland, we will surely open up a new situation of "one country, two systems" and shared development!

    一国两制  共同发展
    姬鹏飞
    中华人民共和国成立40周年的国庆日即将来临，我谨向关心和热爱祖国的港澳同胞致以节日的祝贺。
    新中国成立后，我国政府曾一再声明，香港、澳门是中国的领土。中国人民不承认外国强加给我国的一系列不平等条约。中国政府主张在时机成熟时，通过谈判和平解决这一历史遗留下来的问题。长期以来，我国政府采取了有利于港澳经济繁荣和社会稳定的方针。特别是内地以优惠的价格供应大量主副食品、日用品、淡水和工业原料等，对港澳的经济发展提供了可靠的保证。几十年来，无论内地发生什么样的情况和遭遇到什么样的困难，我们的这一方针始终没有改变。
    中共十一届三中全会以后，我国进入了一个新的历史时期。实现祖国统一，是中国人民在新的历史时期的三大任务之一，而收回香港、澳门，恢复行使主权，这是祖国统一大业的重要组成部分。随着1997年的日益临近，解决香港问题的时机已经成熟。中国政府根据邓小平同志提出的“一国两制”的构想，制定了解决港澳问题的一系列特殊政策。经过同英国和葡萄牙政府谈判，签订了中英关于香港问题的联合声明和中葡关于澳门问题的联合声明，决定我国将于1997年7月1日和1999年12月20日先后对香港和澳门恢复行使主权。
    港澳问题的解决，使我国在实现祖国统一的道路上迈进了一大步，同时，也为国与国之间解决历史遗留下来的问题提供了新的借鉴。
    我国政府根据“一国两制”这一构想制定的一系列方针政策，是从港澳的历史和现状出发的，既维护了国家的主权原则，又能保证港澳继续繁荣稳定，照顾了各方面的利益，受到了港澳同胞的拥护和国际社会的赞许。我国政府对港澳方针政策已在中英、中葡联合声明中得到了具体体现。目前正在起草的香港特别行政区基本法和澳门特别行政区基本法，将把这些方针政策用法律规定下来，50年不变。
    最近一段时间以来，港澳有些人对我国政府能否继续贯彻执行关于香港、澳门问题的方针政策产生了疑虑。关于这个问题，今年6月22日，我已经代表中国政府发表了郑重声明，现在我愿再一次重申：中国政府按照“一国两制”构想所制定的对香港、澳门的一系列政策是不会改变的。中国政府将始终不渝地信守中英关于香港问题的联合声明和中葡关于澳门问题的联合声明。我们的政策不会改变，这是因为“一国两制”构想不是权宜之计，而是一项重大的战略决策。实行这一决策，有利于用和平方式实现国家的统一，有利于继续保持港澳的稳定和繁荣，有利于有关国家保持和发展它们在港澳合理的利益，也有利于维护世界和平。这一充分照顾实际情况和各方面利益的决策是完全正确、切实可行的，是没有理由改变的。
    无论是现在的过渡时期，还是中国恢复行使主权以后，港澳地区实行的是与内地社会主义制度不同的资本主义制度。在处理两地之间的关系问题上，我希望，在经济上，内地和港澳各自发挥自己的优势，通力合作，互惠互利，共同发展。在政治上，内地承认港澳长期保持资本主义制度的现实，不会把社会主义制度和政策推行到港澳去；港澳也要尊重内地的社会主义制度，不要干预或企图改变内地的社会主义制度，更不允许有人利用港澳作为颠覆中央人民政府的基地。内地人到港澳去，要遵守港澳的法律；港澳同胞回到内地，也要遵守国家的宪法和法律，维护国家的主权和统一。总之，内地与港澳应当求一国之同，存两制之异，相互补充，共同发展。
    解放40年来的实践证明，港澳与内地是休戚与共、盛衰相继的关系。港澳的稳定繁荣，有利于祖国的社会主义现代化的建设；祖国的强大，又是港澳稳定繁荣的可靠保证。随着内地改革开放和建设事业的不断深入发展，港澳与内地的经济合作关系必将取得全面的蓬勃的发展。我相信，依靠港澳和内地人民的共同努力，一定能开创一国两制、共同发展的新局面！
