The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, rebuilt in the 1980s, stands proudly on the "Roof of the World." Along with the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, it is cherished by the Tibetan people as a "golden bridge" leading to prosperity and happiness.

In the spring of 1978, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway embarked on an "8-year reconstruction" project. Over 5,000 builders gathered on the Qinghai-Tibet Line, working day and night. On December 25, 1985, the largest and longest second-class highway in China's road construction history—the Qinghai-Tibet Highway—was completed. It is 1,948 kilometers long, nearly doubling the speed and turnover rate of vehicles passing through, saving an annual transportation cost of 50 million yuan. The amount of goods entering and exiting Tibet via this highway has increased severalfold, with the annual total volume of passenger and cargo transport being 5 to 6 times that of 1959.

With the Qinghai-Tibet Highway as the main artery, it has also driven the development of road construction throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region. Currently, Tibet has 21,695 kilometers of roads in operation, with the exception of Motuo, every county is connected by roads. An initial transportation network centered on Lhasa has been built, strengthening the connection between Tibet and the inland regions, and significantly promoting the development of the economy and cultural undertakings in the ethnic minority areas.

　　高原金桥青藏线
    八十年代改建的青藏公路，雄踞“世界屋脊”。它与川藏公路一样，被西藏人民珍视为通向繁荣、幸福的“金桥”。
    1978年春，青藏公路揭开了“8年改建”的壮丽画卷，5000余名建设者云集青藏线，日夜奋战。1985年12月25日，我国公路建设史上工程规模最大、最长的二级公路——青藏公路建成。它长1948公里，将过往车辆的行驶速度、周转率提高了近一倍，节约运输成本每年达5000万元。经这条公路进出西藏的物资成倍增长，全年客货运总量都是1959年的5至6倍。
    以青藏公路为主干线，还带动了西藏全区的公路建设。目前，西藏已通车的公路达21695公里，除墨脱以外，县县都通了公路，初步建设成了一个以拉萨为中心的纵横交通网，密切了西藏与内地的联系，有力地促进了少数民族地区经济、文化事业的发展。
