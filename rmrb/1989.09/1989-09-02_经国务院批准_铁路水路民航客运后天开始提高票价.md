	The State Council has approved the increase in passenger ticket prices for railways, waterways, and civil aviation nationwide starting from September 5. Freight rates and road bus fares will remain unchanged.

	The railway passenger ticket price per person per kilometer will increase from 0.02 yuan to over 0.04 yuan, with an average increase of 112%. Specifically, short-distance tickets (within 100 kilometers) will increase by 60%, while urban-suburban tickets and tickets for hard seats, hard sleepers, soft sleepers, and express services (over 101 kilometers) will all increase by 120%.

	The passenger ticket prices for central government-managed shipping companies in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, the Yangtze River Shipping Company, and the Heilongjiang Shipping Bureau for coastal and inland waterways will increase by an average of 96%. Tickets for fifth-class general seats and fifth-class berths, which are more affordable for self-paying passengers, will see smaller increases. Higher-class cabins will see larger increases.

	Domestic airfare for civil aviation domestic routes will increase by an average of 77%, but 71 major tourist routes with published fares will remain at the original discounted prices until the end of this year.

	Disabled veterans and children traveling by train or ship, as well as students traveling by train during winter and summer vacations, will continue to receive half-price discounts. Considering that some schools have delayed the start of the fall semester, students returning to school or newly enrolled before October 31 will continue to pay the original fares for train and ship travel. Ticket prices for foreign passengers, as well as luggage and parcel rates and related miscellaneous fees for railways, waterways, and civil aviation, will also be adjusted accordingly.

	Additionally, local management of railway, waterway, and aviation passenger ticket prices will be adjusted simultaneously, with announcements made by each locality.

	The State Council pointed out that the main purpose of adjusting passenger ticket prices is to reverse the long-standing issue of low ticket prices and operational losses in railways, waterways, and civil aviation, to increase transportation capacity, to meet the needs of national economic development, to facilitate travel for the public, and to alleviate the difficulties in buying tickets and finding seats. The State Council also emphasized that to maintain market price stability, it is strictly forbidden for any region, department, or enterprise to take advantage of the ticket price increase to raise prices or add new fee items. Violations will be severely investigated and punished, and the responsible parties will be held accountable. At the same time, it is stipulated that from the implementation of the new ticket prices, all unreasonable additional fees, fundraising, and other charges set by local authorities will be stopped.

	The State Council requires transportation departments to take measures, organize efforts, and work hard to improve passenger safety, order, and various fees, enhance service quality, and strengthen anti-corruption efforts. They should present a new image to support the implementation of the new ticket prices.

    经国务院批准
    铁路水路民航客运后天开始提高票价
    新华社北京9月2日电　经国务院批准，全国从9月5日起提高铁路、水路和民航的客运票价。货物运价和公路汽车运价不动。
    铁路客运票价每人公里由二分提高到四分多一点，平均提价幅度是112％。其中：100公里以内的短途票价提高60％；市郊票价及101公里以上的硬座、硬卧、软卧和加快票价均提高120％。
    中央直属的上海、广州海运局，大连轮船公司、长江轮船总公司、黑龙江航运局的沿海、内河客轮客运票价，平均提高96％，其中，自费旅客较多的五等散席和五等卧铺，提价幅度小一些。高等级舱位提价幅度大一些。
    民航国内航线国内旅客票价平均上调77％，但其中71条实行公布票价的主要旅游热线在今年年底前仍按原定的优惠价不变。
    残废军人、小孩乘坐火车、轮船以及学生寒暑假回家乘坐火车享受半价优待。考虑到今年秋季部分学校学生推迟返校的因素，今年10月31日以前返校和新入学的学生仍按原票价乘车、乘船。铁路、水路、民航的外国旅客票价和行李、包裹运价及与客运相关的一些杂费收费标准也作适当调整。
    此外，地方管理的铁路、水路、航空客运票价同时调整，由各地发布。
    国务院指出，调整客运票价的主要目的是为了扭转当前铁路、水运和民航客运票价长期偏低，经营亏损的局面，增加交通运输能力，适应国民经济发展需要，方便群众旅行，缓解买票难坐车难的矛盾。
    国务院通知还强调指出，为了保持市场物价的稳定，严禁各地区、各部门、各企业乘提高客运票价之机“搭车”涨价或增加收费项目，提高收费标准，违者要以干扰深化改革，破坏中央工作部署从严查处，并追究有关负责人的责任。同时还规定：从新票价执行之日起，各地自行规定征收的价外加价、集资等各种不合理收费，一律停止执行。
    国务院要求交通运输部门，要结合提高客运票价，采取措施，组织力量，下大力气，整顿客运治安、客运秩序和各种收费，提高服务质量，加强廉政建设，以崭新面貌配合新票价的实施。
