	Beijing and Sichuan Public Security and Judicial Department Heads
	Refute French Journalist's Fabrications

	New China News Agency, Beijing, September 27 (Reporters Huang Zhimin and Wang Wenjun)
	Our reporters in Beijing and Sichuan today verified with local public security and judicial department heads a matter mentioned by a French journalist from Alsace News during the press conference held by Jiang Zemin and others on September 26. They unanimously pointed out that the journalist's account is pure rumor.

	During yesterday's press conference, the French journalist took the opportunity to ask a question, stating that he knew a female student who was injured during the June 3 incident. In the following days, she was arrested, detained, and interrogated. Then, she was sent to a brick factory in Sichuan to work. In her first week in Sichuan, she was allegedly raped three times by local farmers.

	Deputy Director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, Wang Dingfeng, stated that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the public security authorities investigated some individuals who committed acts of arson, looting, and murder. However, to this day, no one has been sent to Sichuan, let alone the events described by the French journalist. Wang Dingfeng expressed deep regret over the journalist's irresponsible behavior. He said that the journalist blatantly violated the fundamental principle of news reporting, which requires truthfulness, and used such despicable tactics to fabricate ridiculous lies in front of over 300 domestic and foreign colleagues. We strongly condemn this.

	Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Justice, Zheng Wenju, and Director of the Sichuan Provincial Public Security Bureau, Wu Xuede, both pointed out that from June 1, 1989, to the present, no criminals from Beijing have been sent to Sichuan for punishment. There is no such thing as a female student who participated in the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing being sent to a brick factory in Sichuan to work. The journalist's account is pure fabrication.

	Zheng Wenju said that when the French journalist mentioned this matter during the press conference, he did not ask a question but asserted that such an incident had occurred. This violates the professional ethics of journalists who must respect facts. He expressed deep regret over the journalist's public dissemination of such shocking lies.

    北京四川公安司法部门负责人
    驳斥法国记者编造的谎言
    新华社北京9月27日电　（记者黄智敏、王文俊）本社驻北京和四川的记者今天就法国阿尔萨斯最新消息报记者在26日江泽民总书记等举行的中外记者招待会上提及的一件事向两地公安、司法部门负责人进行了核实。他们一致指出，这位记者谈到的事纯属谣言。
    在昨天的记者招待会上，这位法国记者借提问的机会说，他认识一位女学生，她在6月3日晚上的那场行动中受了伤，其后几天她遭到逮捕，并遭到了拘留，而且也受到审问。然后，她就被遣送到四川的一个砖厂劳动。在她到四川的第一个星期里，就被当地的农民强奸了三次。
    北京市公安局副局长王鼎丰说，在平息北京反革命暴乱之后，公安机关审查了一些犯有打砸抢烧杀罪行的人，但时至今日没有一个被遣送到四川的人，更谈不上有这位法国记者所说的事。王鼎丰对这位法国记者极不负责任的作法深表遗憾。他说，这位法国记者公然违背新闻必须真实的这一基本原则，在300余名中外同行面前采用这样恶劣的手法编造出可笑的谎言，对此我们表示极大的愤慨。
    四川省司法厅长郑文举、公安厅长巫学德都指出，从1989年6月1日起到今天，北京没有一个罪犯被押送到四川服刑，更没有什么参加北京反革命暴乱的女学生被遣送到四川的一个砖厂来劳动的事。这位法国记者所说的事纯属编造。
    郑文举说，法国记者在中外记者招待会谈到这件事的时候不是提问而是肯定说有这样一件事，这违背了新闻记者必须尊重事实的职业道德。他对这名法国记者当众散布这种骇人听闻的谎言深表遗憾。
