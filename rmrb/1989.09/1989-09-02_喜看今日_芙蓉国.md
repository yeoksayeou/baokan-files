Socialist Cause Advancing

Delight in Today's "Land of Hibiscus"

Xiōng Qīngquán, Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Hunan Province
Chén Bāngzhù, Governor of Hunan Province

On August 5, 1949, the People's Liberation Army of China marched into the ancient city of Changsha, marking the peaceful liberation of Hunan! From then on, Hunan Province, known as the "Land of Hibiscus," ended the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, embarked on the broad road of socialism. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the basic line of "one center, two basic points" has increasingly taken root in people's hearts. The spring breeze of reform and opening up has swept through the Three Rivers and Four Lakes, and the entire province has shown new vitality and vigor. Looking back over 40 years, the ancient "Land of Hibiscus" has undergone tremendous changes.

Although Hunan has long been known as the "Land of Fish and Rice," in reality, its agricultural foundation was very weak before liberation. After 40 years of construction, the conditions and internal structure of agricultural production have greatly improved. The area with guaranteed harvests against drought and floods has reached 65%, an increase of 7 times compared to 1949. Agriculture has entered a stage of stable development. The rice yield has maintained the top position in the country for many years, and the production of ramie, tea, pigs, oil, and freshwater fish holds an important position in the country. More and more villages are presenting a prosperous scene of lush forests, abundant grain, and the sound of cars and machines. Today's Hunan is no longer just an agricultural province; an industrial system with a certain scale and relatively complete categories has taken shape. Now, the industrial output value of two days is equivalent to the total industrial output value of one year in 1949. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the province (in comparable terms) has increased by 24.5 times, the gross national product has increased by 14.3 times, and the national income has increased by 13.5 times.

The ancients said, "When Hubei is bountiful, the world is sufficient." In fact, in the old society, Hunan rarely had a good harvest, and it was difficult to have enough food even in a good year. How many people were starving and freezing, struggling on the brink of death? Only after the founding of New China did people truly end the miserable history of hunger and poverty, and live a life of plenty. The per capita grain possession in the province has increased from about 200 kilograms in the early days of liberation to more than 450 kilograms now. Farmers' per capita net income has increased from 40 yuan in 1950 to 515 yuan in 1988, and workers' annual wages have increased from 288 yuan to 1,713 yuan. Excluding the price factor, the actual consumption level of the people in the province has increased by an average of 3.3% per year. Urban and rural residents' savings deposits have increased from 200 million yuan in the early days of liberation to 11 billion yuan.

The people of Hunan, who were once known for their ability to farm and fight but not to do business, have, under the impetus of the reform and opening-up tide, stepped onto the stage of planned commodity economy. The past 10 years of reform and opening up have broken the long-standing rigid system and closed situation, bringing about the renewal of people's ideas and the development of commodity economy. The commodity rate of agricultural and sideline products in the province has reached nearly 60%, and the total import and export volume has increased from 9 million US dollars in the early days of liberation to more than 800 million US dollars.

Hunan has a long history, a developed culture, and a large number of talents, and has the reputation of "only in Chu are there talents, and here they flourish." Since the founding of New China, excellent historical and cultural heritage has been inherited and carried forward, and socialist cultural undertakings have prospered. The number of students in various levels and types of schools in the province has increased by more than 5 times, and the number of university students has increased from 2,600 to more than 87,000. The scientific and technological team has continued to grow, and a batch of scientific and technological achievements have reached advanced levels at home and abroad. News publishing, literature and art, health, and sports have all made great progress.

In the great practice of socialist construction and transformation, people's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. Ideological and political education with the Four Cardinal Principles as the main content has been continuously deepened, and the creation of civilized villages, towns, cities, and units, and the joint construction of military (police) and civilians have been widely carried out. People's awareness of socialism, patriotism, and collectivism has gradually improved. The revolutionary spirit of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Luo Ronghuan, and the spirit of the new generation of Lei Feng, continue to inspire the people of Hunan to work hard and struggle together for the revitalization of China and Hunan.

"The dream I have is vast, in the land of hibiscus, the sun shines brightly." Chairman Mao Zedong's beautiful wish is becoming a reality. On the road of socialist modernization construction, the Party organizations at all levels in Hunan and all the people of various ethnic groups in the province are determined to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, firmly implement the Party's basic line, strive to overcome various difficulties in the process of advancement, and further give play to the advantages of agriculture, mineral resources, and tourism, writing a more magnificent new chapter!

专栏：社会主义事业在前进

    喜看今日“芙蓉国”
    中共湖南省委书记　熊清泉
    湖南省省长　陈邦柱
    1949年8月5日，中国人民解放军浩浩荡荡开进古城长沙，宣告湖南和平解放！从此，素有“芙蓉国”美称的湖南省，结束了国民党的反动统治，在中国共产党的领导下，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。党的十一届三中全会以来，“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线日益深入人心，改革开放的春风激荡着三湘四水，全省城乡焕发出新的生机和活力。回首40年，古老的“芙蓉国”发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    湖南虽然自古就有“鱼米之乡”之称，实际上解放前农业的基础十分薄弱。经过40年的建设，农业生产条件和内部结构大为改善，旱涝保收面积达到65％，比1949年增加了7倍。农业已经走上稳步发展的道路。稻谷产量多年来保持全国首位，苎麻、茶叶、生猪、油料、淡水鱼产量在全国占有重要地位。越来越多的乡村出现了林茂粮丰、车欢机鸣的兴旺景象。今天的湖南已经不再是一个单纯的农业省了，一个初具规模、门类比较齐全的工业体系已经形成，现在两天的工业产值相当于1949年一年的工业总产值。全省工农业总产值（按可比口径）增长24.5倍，国民生产总值增长14.3倍，国民收入增长13.5倍。
    古人说：“湖广熟，天下足。”其实，旧社会的湖南，十载难逢几回熟，一年难得几日足。不知有多少人饥寒交迫，挣扎在死亡线上。只有在新中国成立后，人们才真正结束缺吃少穿、民不聊生的苦难历史，过上丰衣足食的幸福生活。全省人均占有粮食由解放初期的200来公斤增加到目前的450多公斤。农民人均纯收入由1950年的40元增加到1988年的515元，职工人年均工资由288元增加到1713元，扣除物价因素，全省人民实际消费水平年均递增3.3％。城乡居民储蓄存款由解放初期的200万元增加到110亿元。
    昔日“会作田、会打仗、不大会做生意”的湖南人，在改革开放大潮的推动下，登上了有计划商品经济的舞台。最近10年的改革开放，打破了长期以来的僵化体制和封闭局面，带来了人们思想观念的更新和商品经济的发展。全省农副产品商品率已接近60％，进出口总额已由解放初期的900万美元增加到8亿多美元。
    湖南历史悠久，文化发达，人才辈出，曾有“惟楚有才，于斯为盛”之誉。新中国成立以来，优秀的历史文化得到继承和发扬，社会主义文化事业欣欣向荣。全省各级各类学校在校学生增加了5倍多，在校大学生由2600人发展到8.7万多人。科技队伍不断壮大，一批科技成果达到国内国际先进水平。新闻出版、文学艺术、卫生、体育事业均有很大发展。
    在社会主义建设和变革的伟大实践中，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。以四项基本原则为主要内容的思想政治教育不断深入，创建文明村镇、文明城市、文明单位和军
  （警）民共建的活动广泛开展，人们的社会主义、爱国主义、集体主义觉悟逐步提高。毛泽东、刘少奇、任弼时、彭德怀、贺龙、罗荣桓等老一辈无产阶级革命家的革命精神和新一代的雷锋精神，不断激励着湖南人民为振兴中华、振兴湖南而艰苦创业，共同奋斗。
    “我欲因之梦寥廓，芙蓉国里尽朝晖。”毛泽东同志的这一美好愿望正在成为现实。在社会主义现代化建设的道路上，湖南各级党组织和全省各族人民决心更紧密地团结在以江泽民同志为核心的党中央周围，坚定不移地执行党的基本路线，努力战胜前进中的各种困难，进一步发挥农业、矿藏和旅游等资源优势，谱写出更加壮丽的新篇章！（附图片）
