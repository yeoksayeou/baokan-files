Gorbachev Meets with Leaders of Three Republics, Calls for Maintaining Party and State Unity

	NEW DELHI, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by TASS on the 15th, on September 13, Soviet leader Gorbachev met with party and government leaders from the three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. He called for maintaining the unity of the Soviet Federation and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

	Gorbachev pointed out that for the benefit of the Soviet people and the people of the three Baltic republics, three extremely important principles must be adhered to: first, all issues must be resolved together within the framework of the federation; second, the CPSU is unified, and the party is the fundamental guarantee of reform and national revival; third, the rights of all nationalities are equal. Gorbachev emphasized that these three principles are the basic elements of the party's national policy and the premise for coordinating national relations.

	Recently, large-scale demonstrations took place in these three republics around the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German pact. Some extremists raised slogans such as "secede from the Soviet Union" and "overthrow the CPSU." In response, the CPSU Central Committee issued a statement, calling on local party and government leaders to take measures to stabilize the situation.

	Gorbachev stated that each republic has various connections with other republics and the entire federation. If these connections are severed and republics demanding independence are allowed to secede from the federation, the entire country will regress by 10 years. He said that the sovereignty of the union republics can only be fully realized within the framework of the federation in all aspects.

	He particularly emphasized the need to maintain the unity of the CPSU. He said that weakening this powerful political entity would be a major historical mistake. He believed that implementing the idea of federalism within the party structure poses a fatal danger to the party's unity. Gorbachev said that the most important task at present is to strengthen cooperation on the basis of equality among all nationalities, without harming the rights of any nationality.

	The Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided that from next year, the three Baltic republics will implement regional economic accounting. When discussing this issue, Gorbachev said that regional economic accounting gives the republics the maximum possible rights, but it should not harm the benefits provided by the federation and should not disrupt the financial, credit, and monetary policies implemented throughout the Soviet Union.

	The first secretaries of the party central committees, the chairmen of the presidiums of the Supreme Soviets, and the chairmen of the councils of ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia participated in this meeting. They introduced the situations in their respective republics.

	On the 19th of this month, the CPSU Central Committee will hold a plenary session to specifically discuss national issues. This meeting is a preparation for the central committee's plenary session.

　　戈尔巴乔夫会见三共和国领导人
　　要求维护党和国家统一
    新华社莫科斯9月15日电　据塔斯社15日报道，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫9月13日会见苏联波罗的海沿岸立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚3个共和国的党政领导人时，要求维护苏维埃联邦和苏联共产党的统一。
    戈尔巴乔夫指出，为了苏联人民和波罗的海沿岸3个共和国人民的利益，现在必须坚持极重要的3条原则：第一，只能在联邦的范围内大家一起解决所有的问题；第二，苏共是统一的，党是改革和民族复兴进程的根本保证；第三，所有民族居民的权利平等。戈尔巴乔夫强调，这3条是党的民族政策的基本环节，是协调民族关系的前提。
    前不久，在这3个共和国围绕苏德条约签署50周年发生了大规模的示威游行，一些极端分子提出了“脱离苏联”和“打倒苏共”等口号。对此，苏共中央曾发表声明，要求当地党政领导采取措施稳定局势。
    戈尔巴乔夫表示，每个共和国都与其他共和国和全联邦有着各种各样的联系，如果中断这些联系，允许要求独立的共和国脱离联邦，那么整个国家就会倒退10年。他说，加盟共和国的主权只有在联邦的范围内才能在各方面获得最广泛的可能性。
    他特别强调维护苏联共产党的统一。他说，如果削弱苏共这个强大的政治机体，那将是一个重大的历史性错误。他认为，在党的结构中实行联邦制思想对党的统一有致命的危险。戈尔巴乔夫说，当前最重要的任务是，在各民族平等的基础上加强合作，不能损害任何一个民族的权利。
    苏联最高苏维埃已决定，波罗的海沿岸3个共和国从明年起实行地区经济核算。谈到这一问题时，戈尔巴乔夫说，地区经济核算赋予共和国以最大限度的权利，但不应当损害为联邦提供的好处，不能破坏在全苏实行的金融、信贷和货币政策。
    立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚3个共和国的党中央第一书记、最高苏维埃主席团主席、部长会议主席参加了这次会见，他们介绍了各自共和国的形势。
    本月19日，苏共中央将举行全会专门讨论民族问题。这次会见是为中央全会作准备。
