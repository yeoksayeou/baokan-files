China's mass sports industry has flourished along a path with Chinese characteristics over the past 40 years. The birth of New China and the establishment of the socialist system have opened up a vast arena for the broad laboring masses to participate in sports.

In the early 1950s, Comrade Mao Zedong timely and clearly proposed the guiding principle of "developing sports, enhancing the people's physique." The Party and the government regard sports as a major issue concerning the health of the entire nation, an active factor in improving the quality of laborers, and an important component in building socialist spiritual civilization. They have included "the state developing sports, carrying out mass sports activities, and enhancing the people's physique" in the Constitution and listed it as an agenda item for the Party and the government's work. They have established sports management departments to lead, coordinate, and supervise sports work nationwide.

With the development of the economy, the progress of society, and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, sports have gradually permeated various fields of society. So far, there are approximately 300 million people nationwide who regularly participate in sports activities. The number of people who have passed the _National Fitness Standards_ has exceeded 300 million. The physical fitness of the entire population has greatly improved, and the average life expectancy is now nearly 70 years, almost double that of the pre-liberation era. The level of sports has also greatly improved.

The 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been the best period for the development of mass sports in China. During this period, a notable feature of China's mass sports is that a path has been explored to develop sports based on the actual situation of the primary stage of socialism in China, seeking truth from facts, breaking through vertically, expanding horizontally, penetrating society, entering families, and moving from mass participation to high levels. This serves to enhance the people's physique and build socialist material and spiritual civilization. The breakthrough point to achieve this goal is the socialization of mass sports.

This is a path to develop sports with Chinese characteristics.

Following this path is like grasping two lines: one is the warp (horizontal line), and the other is the weft (vertical line). The former mainly focuses on departmental sports, with departments as the main organizers; the latter mainly focuses on mass sports, with mass organizations and mass sports organizations as the main organizers. In this way, a large network of sports socialization is woven, making sports activities throughout the nation flourish.

With the development of sports socialization, China's mass sports have presented an unprecedentedly lively scene, and the situation is gratifying. Currently, there are 14 industry sports associations nationwide, with nearly 40,000 grassroots sports associations. As for regional horizontal alliances, there are even more. Guangdong and Shanghai alone have nearly a hundred regional sports associations, with over a million participants in activities. Street sports associations and workers' clubs are also developing rapidly and have become an important channel for carrying out workers' sports. There are more than 18,000 various sports training groups, and grassroots factory and mine sports teams have reached 490,000, with over 40 million workers regularly participating in sports activities, accounting for about 40% of the total number of workers.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's rural sports have taken three major steps: first, in 1985, the activity to create sports advanced counties was successfully carried out nationwide; second, in 1986, with the approval of the Central Committee, the Chinese Farmers' Sports Association, a sports organization for the vast majority of farmers, was established; third, in 1988, the First National Farmers' Games were successfully held. These are major events in the history of China's farmers' sports development, and now rural sports are showing an unprecedented development trend.

School sports, as a strategic focus of the entire sports work, are increasingly being placed on an important agenda. Central leaders pay great attention to this. In September this year, the _Student Physical Fitness Standards_ were implemented in ordinary high schools nationwide; the _National Fitness Standards_ were revised; the seventh set of children's radio (rhythmic) gymnastics and the fifth set of youth radio (rhythmic) gymnastics were compiled and published; rules were studied and formulated to "strengthen school sports and health work, enhance students' physical health," and the _Regulations on School Sports Work_ and the _After-School Sports Training Plan_ were revised. All these have greatly promoted the development of school sports work.

In addition, with the development of various single-item sports association activities, recreational sports activities nationwide have also rapidly developed. Such as dragon boat racing, shuttlecock, pigeon racing, kite flying, fishing, aerobics, gateball, roller skating, qigong, etc., have become popular projects that the masses love and participate in frequently, with an increasing number of enthusiasts and participants every day.

As for senior sports, disabled sports, and ethnic minority sports, they are also flourishing and very active, becoming three powerful teams in group activities, with a strong momentum. Many of their activities have already entered the grand stage of domestic and international competitions, attracting widespread attention from people at home and abroad.

    从“东亚病夫”到“东亚健儿”
    ——我国群众体育事业大发展
    朱德录
    我国的群众体育事业，沿着具有中国特色的道路，40年来得以蓬勃发展。新中国的诞生，社会主义制度的建立，为广大劳动人民开辟了参加体育锻炼的广阔天地。
    50年代初，毛泽东同志就及时而明确地提出了“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指导方针。党和政府把体育看成是关系到全国人民健康的大事，提高劳动者素质的积极因素，建设社会主义精神文明的重要内容，把“国家发展体育事业，开展群众性体育活动，增强人民体质”写进宪法，列入党和政府工作的议事日程，建立体育主管部门，对全国的体育工作进行领导、协调、监督。
    随着经济的发展，社会的进步，人民物质文化生活水平的提高，体育逐渐渗透到社会各个领域。到目前为止，全国经常参加体育活动的约有3亿人左右。通过《国家体育锻炼标准》的人数已超过3亿人次。全国人民的体质大大增强，人均寿命现在已近70岁，比解放前提高了将近一倍。体育运动水平也大大提高了。
    党的十一届三中全会以来的10年，是我国群众体育发展最好的时期。这一时期，我国群众体育的一大特点是：摸索出了一条从我国社会主义初级阶段的实际出发、实事求是、突破纵向、打开横向、深入社会、进入家庭、通过群众性、走向高水平的发展体育之路，使群众体育为增强人民体质、为建设社会主义物质文明和精神文明服务。达到这个目标的突破口，就是群众体育的社会化。
    这是一条具有中国特色的发展体育之路。
    走这条路子，宛如抓住两条线，一条是经线（即横线），一条是纬线（即纵线），前者主要是抓部门体育，以部门为主办；后者主要抓群众体育，由群众团体、群众性体育组织为主办。这样就织成体育社会化的大网络，使全民族体育活动开展起来。
    随着体育社会化的发展，我国群众体育呈现出空前活跃的景象，形势喜人。目前全国已成立行业体协14个，有近4万个基层体协。至于区域性横向联合的就更多了。仅广东、上海就有近百个地区性体协，上百万人参加活动。街道体协和职工俱乐部也在迅速发展，已成为开展职工体育的一条重要渠道。各种各样的体育锻炼小组已有1.8万多个，基层厂矿运动队已达49万多个，经常参加体育活动的职工已达4000多万人，约占职工总数的40％左右。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国农村体育也迈出了三大步：一是1985年在全国成功地开展了争创体育先进县的活动；二是1986年经中央批准，广大农民的体育组织——中国农民体协成立；三是1988年胜利地召开了第一届全国农民运动会。这些都是我国农民体育发展史上的重大事件，现在农村体育已呈现空前发展的势头。
    学校体育作为整个体育工作的战略重点，也日益被提到重要的议事日程，中央领导同志对此十分关心。今年9月份在全国普通中学高中阶段实施《中学生体育合格标准》制度；对《国家体育锻炼标准》进行了修订；编制公布了第七套儿童广播（韵律）体操和第五套青少年广播（韵律）体操；研究制订了“加强学校体育卫生工作，增强学生体质健康的规则”，修订了
  《学校体育工作条例》和开展《课余体育训练规划》。所有这些都有力地促进了学校体育工作的开展。
    此外，随着各单项体协活动的开展，全国具有娱乐性的体育活动也得到迅速发展。如龙舟、毽球、信鸽、风筝、钓鱼、健美操、门球、轮滑、气功等，已成为广大群众十分喜爱、经常参加的热门项目，爱好者参与者与日俱增。
    至于老年人体育、伤残人体育、少数民族体育更是方兴未艾，活跃非常，已成为群体活动中的三支强大队伍，大有异军突起之势。他们的许多活动已经登上了国内外比赛的大雅之堂，引起国内外人士的广泛关注。
