Title: China's Opening Provides New Opportunities for Hong Kong's Industrial Development

Life is full of many unforgettable firsts. In early 1979, I made my first trip to China's northwestern region, Xinjiang. At that time, China had just implemented its open-door policy, and there were not many overseas visitors, let alone investors. Many things were still a mystery to me. Looking back now, that trip to Xinjiang was not in vain. I saw vast pastures and large tracts of undeveloped land with my own eyes, and I personally interacted with the warm and sincere people of Xinjiang. My investment ideas became more concrete and realistic. In the following year and a half, I visited Xinjiang five times, and finally signed the joint venture agreement, establishing the first Sino-foreign joint venture in Xinjiang—Xinjiang Tianshan Wool Textile Co., Ltd. In addition, I invested in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places, setting up more than ten joint venture factories of varying sizes.

Some people might ask, why are you so enthusiastic about investing in the mainland? The reasons are naturally multifaceted, but the most important factor is that the mainland has many conditions that are difficult to find in Hong Kong for industrial development.

I have been engaged in the textile industry for nearly 40 years. I clearly remember that when I and my friends jointly opened our first cotton mill, the average daily wage for each worker was 3 Hong Kong dollars, and the prices of land and electricity were very low.

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the average daily wage for each worker in Hong Kong had risen to seventy or eighty Hong Kong dollars, land prices were exorbitant, and electricity was no longer cheap. The Hong Kong government adopted a high-interest rate policy, making it even more difficult for many small and medium-sized factories that were already in trouble. During 1978 to 1980, many textile factories in Hong Kong found it hard to continue operating.

The opening of the mainland provided us with new opportunities for development. The mainland's raw materials, land, and labor force are all conditions that we need but find difficult to obtain in Hong Kong. When we built the factory in Tianshan, although it was a barren wasteland with uneven roads and inadequate water and electricity supply, there was no shortage of land and labor. After a few years of effort, a factory was built there. Last year, the sales revenue of our Tianshan Wool Textile Co., Ltd. exceeded 200 million yuan, with a total profit of nearly 50 million yuan. This achievement would not have been possible if we had remained in Hong Kong. Now, just the Tianshan Wool Textile Co., Ltd. and the Shanghai United Wool Textile (Group) Co., Ltd. that I invested in Shanghai have more than 5,000 employees, while all 300-plus wool and knitting factories in Hong Kong have only about 5,000 workers in total.

Of course, what I say does not mean that investing in the mainland will be entirely smooth sailing. In fact, there have been many difficulties. Over the past ten years, there have been both peaks and valleys in development. I believe that this is inevitable in industrial development and growth. A wise businessman should have a broad mind and a far-reaching vision.

Recently, I visited Beijing and the Pearl River Delta for inspections and talks. Our projects are also making progress. I firmly believe that the economic development of Hong Kong cannot do without industry. China's ten years of opening up have already intertwined the industrial development of Hong Kong with the mainland economy in an inseparable bond.

### 中国的开放给香港工业发展提供了新机会

    中国的开放给香港工业发展提供了新机会
    香港半岛针织有限公司董事长　唐翔千
    人生，有许许多多难忘的第一次，1979年初，我第一次到了中国西北部的新疆。那时，中国刚实施开放政策，到那里参观游览的海外人士还不多，考虑投资的就更少，很多东西对我来说还是个谜。现在回过头看，这趟新疆之行没有白费。我亲眼看到了广阔的牧场，大片还没有开发的土地，亲身接触了热情真诚的新疆人。我的投资设想变得比较具体、实在了。此后的一年多，我5次察访新疆，最后在合资协议书上正式签了字，办起了新疆第一家中外合资企业——天山毛纺织品有限公司。此外，我在上海、广东等地陆续投资，办了10多家规模大小不等的合资工厂。
    也许有人会问，你为什么对到内地投资设厂这样热心？原因自然是多方面的，最不能忽略的是，内地有很多我们在香港办工业难以求得的条件。
    我一直从事纺织工业，苦心经营近40年。我清楚地记得，那时，我和友人合伙开办的第一家棉纺厂，每个工人平均日工资是3港元，土地、电力价格都是很低的。
    到了70年代末、80年代初，香港每个工人平均日工资上升到七八十港元，土地价格昂贵，电力也不再便宜了。香港政府采取高利率政策，致使已面临困境的众多中小厂家难上加难。在1978年至1980年间，本地纺织业内好些厂都深感难以为继。
    中国内地的开放，给我们提供了发展的新机会。内地原料、土地、劳动力等条件，都是我们在香港继续发展所需要而又难以寻觅的。我们到天山建厂时，那里虽是一片荒芜，道路不平，供水供电也谈不上，但土地、劳动力不缺。几年努力，这里就建设起来了。去年一年，我们的天山毛纺织品有限公司产品销售收入突破了两亿元人民币，利润总额近5000万元。这番事业，若囿于香港，那是无法实现的。如今，仅天山毛纺织品有限公司和我在上海投资的上海联合毛纺织
  （集团）有限公司，已共有员工5000多人了，而整个香港300多家毛纺、毛针织厂，总共也才5000多工人。
    当然，我这样说，并不等于表示到内地投资设厂一切都会很顺利，事实上困难也不少，10年下来，发展有波峰也有浪谷。我觉得，这在工业发展成长中是很难免的。一个精明的实业家，应有阔大的胸怀，远大的目光。
    最近，我到过北京，还到过珠江三角洲去参观、洽谈。我们洽谈的项目也有进展。我深信，香港的经济发展，不能没有工业。中国的10年开放，已经使香港工业和内地经济结下了不解之缘。
