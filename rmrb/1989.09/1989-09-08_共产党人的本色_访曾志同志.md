Recently, due to work-related reasons, I visited Comrade Zeng Zhi.

Comrade Zeng, now 78 years old, has a slender frame and a gaunt face. The fires of battle and the ravages of time have left deep marks on this old revolutionary. She is warm and kind, like an ordinary grandmother. But her eyes are bright, and her brow often shows the steadfastness of one who has been tested by time. This old soldier, who joined the Communist Party of China in 1926 and participated in the revolutionary struggles of Jinggangshan, and who, after liberation, worked long-term in party organizational work and held many high-level leadership positions, is deeply concerned about the fundamental improvement of party discipline in the new situation of reform and opening up. How to carry forward the fine traditions of party ideological and political work in the new situation is also a topic she often considers.

I was an uninvited guest and felt a bit uneasy, fearing that the old lady might be displeased. However, Comrade Zeng did not mind. At that time, her family had just finished dinner, and the table, stained with paint, had a simple meal of two dishes and a soup. Comrade Zeng put down her chopsticks and warmly received me. She spoke softly and slowly, like chatting at home, and my initial sense of restraint disappeared.

I looked around. This was an ordinary residence. The furnishings in the living room and bedroom were extremely simple, with no fashionable furniture. The old sofa had a faded cover with a few patches that were difficult to mend. On the walls, except for a portrait of Tao Zhu sent by the War Drama Troupe, the walls were bare, with no decorations. A standard color TV looked modest compared to the large-screen, remote-controlled TVs that were popular at the time. The refrigerator was a recently purchased domestic model. The old single-tub washing machine by White Lily had long been broken and was placed in the corner. Comrade Zeng was wearing a dark old jacket with a blue and white polka-dot shirt collar turned out—it seemed to have been worn for at least 10 years. Occasionally, she raised her arm, revealing a watch on her wrist that had turned yellow with age. I felt a warmth in my heart, remembering a story I had heard: a few years ago, Comrade Li Dawei visited Comrade Zeng's home for the first time on official business, just in time for dinner. The main dish was a bowl of soup. Comrade Zeng invited the guest to sit down and eat together, quickly spreading a plastic tablecloth—it was so old that the middle was torn, wrinkled, and could not be smoothed out. Li Dawei was deeply moved and said, "Communist officials are different from Kuomintang officials!"

I asked about the tablecloth. Comrade Zeng said, "Later, I cut it in half, sewed the edges together, and it was good for a few more years."

While talking, Comrade Zeng took out a few strings of grapes and asked the young nanny to wash them. She proudly told me, "These are the ones I grew myself, please try them."

That evening, Comrade Zeng's daughter, Comrade Tao Siliang, was also at home. I asked about Comrade Zeng's health, and Siliang said, "Although she is in her seventies and eighties and looks thin, she often goes to the market herself to buy vegetables. The market is far away, and it takes an hour or two to go back and forth!" I was surprised, "Isn't there a nanny at home?" Comrade Zeng said, "It's good to go out yourself: it can exercise the body and understand the situation. Being among the people every day makes one feel at ease." Siliang laughed, "There are many benefits, but it's tough on us. Mom goes to buy vegetables, and she often doesn't buy fish or meat. She never buys seasonal vegetables—unless there are guests. Mom also doesn't allow us to spend money to add dishes. My two children are thin, and they complain that they were starved thin by their grandmother. But grandmother says: isn't this good? It's just a lack of fish and meat and such, haven't you gone hungry? In the summer, we don't buy watermelons until they drop to 2 jiao per pound. Once, my child saw that watermelons had dropped to 4 jiao per pound, so they bought one to try, but grandmother criticized the child for being extravagant and really got angry, firmly refusing to eat it in protest. Mother often says, 'Extravagance is corruption. I grew up in extravagance, and I hate extravagance.' But if you think my mother is naturally stingy, you would be wrong. Mother has always been very generous to others. For example, she sends money to the former landlord when she was sent down, invites them to Beijing to play, and takes care of their meals and accommodation; she sends them money when they leave; a former nanny had to return home because of a sick family member, and mother gave her 200 yuan; a young man from my father's hometown was admitted to a university, although they were not acquainted, mother was very happy and immediately sent 300 yuan to encourage him. Those who know us well know that mother is very generous to others."

I asked, "Does Comrade Zeng still hold any positions?" Comrade Zeng calmly said, "I retired a long time ago, I am completely retired." Siliang said, "'Completely' what? Here, the Women's Federation holds a meeting, and there, the Young Pioneers hold an activity, and mother is enthusiastic about it!" Comrade Zeng said, "As a Communist Party member, one should always do some duty. In modern terms, it is called giving back to society."

I suddenly asked a question that might have been inappropriate: "I heard that Comrade Tao Zhu left a lot of manuscript fees..." Siliang said, "Father's manuscript fees and national bonds, plus the later organizational compensation, mother and I did not take a single cent, all of it was turned over to the public." I said, "Actually, your income is not high, keeping a little for use is also good!" Comrade Zeng said, "I think, we did this, it must be in line with Comrade Tao Zhu's wishes. Self-discipline and frugality are also the family traditions passed down by Tao Zhu. If you talk about income, I have not had a single increase in salary since I was graded in 1952, and it has even been reduced three times. Sometimes, the money is a bit tight, but as long as it is carefully managed, life can still be lived. The people are not yet rich, if the party cadres have a lot of money, can they be at ease?"

While talking, Comrade Zeng suddenly remembered the grapes she asked the nanny to wash and had not been brought in, smiling and saying, "This child must have gone to play somewhere." She got up and went to the kitchen herself, washed the grapes, put them in a bowl, and brought them in, telling the story of the grapes: "The grapes I grew had a harvest last year, I really wanted to try them, but they were 'communized' by the nannies in this courtyard, not a single string was left. These children! If they had left me a string, I would have been very satisfied." Comrade Zeng's tone was so gentle when she scolded others, and her eyes were full of loving light. Siliang also laughed, "This year, everyone took care of the old mother and left several strings, otherwise, you might not have had a share today." Comrade Zeng kept urging me to eat, but she did not eat a single grain, squinting her eyes, enjoying my expression of eating with relish, and asked, "How is it, the grapes are very sweet and not sour at all, right?" Seeing me nod, Comrade Zeng smiled sweetly.

The topic changed, and I suggested that the old lady go out and see the new situation of reform and opening up in various places. She sighed and said, "I thought about it, but I dare not go out. We, when we go out, the local government and various levels of leaders always arrange for us to stay in high-level accommodations and eat well. The more it is like this, the more uneasy I feel. So, I try to go out as little as possible. For the same reason, except in special circumstances, I generally do not accept invitations to banquets. Seeing that kind of extravagant eating and drinking, I feel uncomfortable." The old lady thought for a while and continued, "The people are very angry about the corrupt phenomena within the party. In fact, truly corrupt cadres are very few. I also dislike such people." I sincerely said, "If all Communist Party members were like you, it would be great." Comrade Zeng said, "You don't know, in fact, there are many old comrades like me. Just take this big courtyard, for example, there are many ministers and governors living here, the vast majority are still very ordinary, just like my family."

From Comrade Zeng's tone and expression, I completely believed this was true. I, like many young people, had felt disappointed about the party discipline issue. This visit gave me an unexpected gain: about party discipline, it may be too early to be fully optimistic, but it is also unfounded to be pessimistic and disappointed. The excellent qualities of Communist Party members, especially the old generation of Communist Party members, will not be submerged by a few corrupt elements.

I did not have the task of writing anything this time, but on the way home, I suddenly thought: I should write down what I saw and heard tonight and let everyone know.

    共产党人的本色
    ——访曾志同志
    秦天祥
    最近，因工作上的缘故，我访问了曾志同志。
    曾妈妈今年78岁，身材瘦小，面容清癯。战斗的烈火、岁月的风刀无情地在这位老人的额上留下深深的印记。她亲切而慈祥，像一位普普通通的老祖母一样。但她目光炯炯，眉宇间时时露出久经考验的坚毅。这位早年投身革命，1926年就加入中国共产党，参加过井冈山革命斗争，解放后长期做党的组织工作，曾经担任过许多高级领导职务的老战士，在改革、开放的新形势下，时刻关心着党风的根本好转。怎样在新形势下，继续发扬党的思想政治工作的优良传统，也是她经常考虑的课题。
    我是不速之客，心中不免惴惴，生怕老人不快。曾妈妈却不介意。当时，她家刚吃过晚餐，油漆斑驳的桌上，摆着很简单的两菜一汤。曾妈妈放下碗筷，热情地接待了我。她说得很轻、很慢，像拉家常一样随便而自然。我刚来时的拘束感无影无踪了。
    我环顾四周。这是一套平常的住宅。客厅和住房的陈设异常简朴，没有一件时髦的家具。陈旧的沙发上，沙发巾已经被洗得褪了颜色，并有两三个显然很难补缀的窟窿。墙上，除战士话剧团送的一幅陶铸油画像外，四壁皆空，没有任何装饰。一台普通的彩电，比起眼下时兴的大屏幕方角遥控彩电来，显得有些寒碜。冰箱是最近才添置的国产货。白兰牌单缸洗衣机早已破损，被搁在墙角。曾妈妈穿着一件深色的旧外套，蓝底白点的衬衣领子翻在外面——看样子，至少穿了10年。她偶尔抬一下手臂，手腕上露出一块面上已经发黄的天津产旧表。我心头一热，想起听人讲过的一件事：几年前，李大维同志第一次因公来到曾妈妈家，正赶上她家吃晚饭，主菜仅是一道汤。曾妈妈请客人入座，一起喝汤，并赶紧铺上塑料桌布——那桌布因过于老化，中间早已破损，皱皱巴巴、怎么也铺不平整。李大维被深深感动了，说：“共产党的官与国民党的官就是不一样啊！”
    我又问起这块桌布。曾妈妈说：“后来，我把它从中间剪开，把边上的对到中间，缝补一下，挺好的，又用了好几年。”
    说话间，曾妈妈拿出几串葡萄，请小保姆拿去洗洗。她自豪地告诉我：“这是我自己种的，请你尝尝。”
    当晚，曾妈妈的女儿陶斯亮同志也在家。我问起曾妈妈的健康，斯亮说：“别看她七老八十、瘦骨嶙峋的，还常常自己跑到菜场去买菜，菜场又远，来回要走个把小时呢！”我一惊：“家里不是有保姆吗？”曾妈妈说：“自己跑跑好处多：可以锻炼身体，又可以了解社情，天天置身于群众中，心里感到踏实。”斯亮笑了：“好处是多，可是苦了我们了。妈妈去买菜，鱼呀、肉呀，常常舍不得买。
    从来不买时令菜——除非有客人来。妈也不许我们花钱添菜。我的两个孩子长得细条条的，他们抱怨说，都是给姥姥饿瘦的。姥姥却说：这不挺好吗？不就缺点鱼呀、肉呀什么的，哪顿饭饿着你们了？夏天，西瓜不降到2角钱1斤，我们是不买的。有一回，我孩子看到西瓜降到4角1斤了，就买个来尝尝新鲜，姥姥却批评孩子太奢侈，真的生了气，坚决不吃，以示‘抗议’。妈妈常说：‘奢侈就是腐败。我是在奢侈中长大的，我讨厌奢侈。’不过，假如你以为我妈天生小气，那可就错了。妈妈对别人从来都是很慷慨的。比如，她寄钱给从前下放时的房东，请他们来北京玩，妈妈管吃管住，临走还送给盘缠；从前那位小保姆因为家有病人必须回去，妈妈送了她200元；我爸爸家乡有位后生考上了大学，虽然素不相识，妈妈听了很高兴，马上寄去300元以资鼓励。熟知我们的人都知道，妈妈对人是很大方的。”
    我问：“曾妈妈是否还担任什么职务？”曾妈妈坦然地说：“早就退了，我是彻底地退。”斯亮说：“‘彻底’什么呀，这里妇联开个会，那儿少先队员举行什么活动，妈妈热心着呢！”曾妈妈说：“共产党员嘛，总要尽一点义务。用时新一点的话说，叫做发挥余热。”
    我冷不丁提了一个也许很不应该提的问题：“听说，陶铸同志留下不少稿费……”斯亮说：“爸爸留下的稿费、公债连同后来组织上补发的抚恤金，妈妈和我一分都没有要，全部交公了。”我说：“其实，你们收入并不多，留下一点备用也好呵！”曾妈妈说：“我想，我们这样做，一定更符合陶铸同志的意愿。克己奉公、艰苦朴素，也是陶铸同志传下的家风。要说收入，我从1952年定级以来，工资一分也没有长，反而降过三次。有时，手头是感到紧一点，但，只要精打细算，日子还算过得去。人
  民还不富裕，如果党的干部手头阔绰，能安心吗？”
      说着说着，曾妈妈忽然想起请保姆洗的葡萄还没端来，笑笑说：“这孩子，一定到哪儿玩去了。”她起身到厨房去，自己把葡萄洗了，盛在一个盘子里端进来，并讲起了关于葡萄的故事：“我种的葡萄，去年有了收获，我真想尝尝，不料被这个院子里的保姆们‘共产’了，一串都没留。这些孩子！如果留给我一串，我就很满意了。”曾妈妈责备别人的时候，语气竟是如此温和，眼里洋溢着慈爱的光芒。斯亮也不禁笑了起来：“今年，大家很照顾老妈妈，留了好几串，否则，今天就可能没有你的份了。”曾妈妈一个劲地劝我吃，自己却一粒也不吃，眯起眼睛，欣赏着我吃得津津有味的神情，问道：“怎么样，这葡萄很甜很甜，一点都不酸吧？”见我点头，曾妈妈笑得可甜了。
    话题一转，我建议老人到处走走，看看各地改革开放的新局面。她感慨地说：“想是这样想的。但是，不敢出门。我们这些人，一出门，地方政府和各级领导总是把我们安排得好好的，住得高级，吃得也好。越是这样，我越是心中不安。所以，我是尽量少走动。由于同样的原因，除了特殊情况，我一般不接受宴请。看到那种大吃大喝，我心里就难受。”老人沉思了一会，接着说：“对党内存在的一些腐败的现象，人民群众很气愤。其实，真正腐败的干部是极少数。对这种人，人民不满，我也看不惯。”我由衷地说：“共产党人都像您老这样就好了。”曾妈妈说：“你不知道，其实，像我这样的老同志很多都是这样的。就说我们这个大院吧，住了不少部长、省长一级的干部，绝大多数，还不是跟我家差不多，很普通很普通的。”
    从曾妈妈的语气和眼神中，我完全相信这是事实。我曾同许多年轻人一样，对党风问题感到失望。这次访问，使我得到了一个意外的收获：关于党风，充分乐观也许还为时过早，但悲观失望也是没有根据的。共产党人、尤其是老一代共产党人的优秀品质，决不会被少数腐败分子所淹没。
    这次访问，我本没有写点什么东西的任务，但回家的路上，我忽然想：应该把我今晚的所见所闻写出来，让大家知道。
