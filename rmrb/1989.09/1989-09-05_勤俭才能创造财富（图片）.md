Thrift Creates Wealth

	In front of the grain warehouse, an elderly woman is squatting on the ground, picking up the scattered grains of rice that fell during the delivery. Seeing this scene, one can't help but think of those who waste national resources and indulge in extravagant living. Would they feel ashamed seeing this?

	When visiting the tungsten mine in Dingnan County, one sees an old man carefully shaking a triangular iron scoop in a large iron pot filled with clean water. He is meticulous in his work. Since 1981, he has collected 15,740 kilograms of tungsten sand from the mine's drying grounds, ditches, ash piles, and car compartments, creating nearly 200,000 yuan in wealth for the country. He is the diligent worker, Zhang Guifen, who never slackens in his mundane and repetitive work.

    勤俭才能创造财富
    （下图）在粮库门前，一位老大娘蹲在地上，将交粮时散落在地上的稻谷拾起来。见此情景，不由得想起那些浪费国家资财、花天酒地的人，他们见此情景会感到羞愧吗？

    （上图）到定南县钨矿，见一老人正在一口储清水的大铁锅里摇晃着一三角形的铁撮箕，一丝不苟。他就是自1981年以来，从矿区晒场上、水沟中、炉灰里、车厢中清扫来的尘土中，淘洗出15740多公斤钨砂，为国家创造近20万元财富的勤杂工曾桂文老人。他从不因为工作平凡、单调而稍有懈怠。
