For the founding of the Republic, the old Red Army soldiers, the old Eighth Route Army soldiers, and the old soldiers have made great contributions. After retirement, they spend their later years happily. Many of them describe their later years as "the setting sun is beautiful."

Recently, reporters visited several military retirement homes in Beijing and Shijiazhuang. They witnessed the joyful scenes of the retired cadres' later lives. After breakfast, after seeing off their children who go to work, the cadres either carry a basket to go shopping, tend to flowers on the balcony, play on the sports field, or engage in a game of Chinese chess. The retirement homes are filled with laughter and joy.

According to relevant departments, there are currently more than 110,000 retired cadres who enlisted before the founding of the nation. To ensure that these old comrades have a comfortable retirement, the State Council and the Central Military Commission have formulated a series of systems and regulations to guarantee that the living and political treatment of retired cadres is not lower than before retirement. In the past decade, despite the country's economic difficulties and tight military budget, the Military Commission allocated special funds to build more than a thousand retirement homes, accommodating 6,600 households of retired cadres. Additionally, 25,000 military retired cadres have been accommodated by local governments. Each unit has invested a large amount of manpower, material resources, and funds to strengthen the construction of retirement homes, equip them with staff and vehicles, improve medical and health care and cultural entertainment facilities, and serve the old cadres wholeheartedly. Each retirement home has established political study and party life systems, organized retired cadres to visit factories and rural areas, and carried out activities such as calligraphy, qigong, and dancing that are beneficial to physical and mental health. More than 30 military-run senior universities have enrolled over 10,000 old cadres for study.

    夕阳无限好　晚景似春光
    军队离休干部安度晚年
    新华社北京9月27日电　（通讯员边士法、记者赵苏）为共和国的创建立下汗马功劳的老红军、老八路、老战士，离休后幸福地安度晚年。他们当中的许多人用“夕阳无限好”赞美自己的晚景。
    记者近日走访了北京、石家庄地区几个军队干休所，目睹了离休老干部晚年生活的欢乐景象。早饭后，送走了上班的子女，老干部们有的提上菜篮子步入街头，有的到阳台上侍弄花草，有的在球场上角逐，有的在楚河汉界旁“厮杀”，干休所里笑声朗朗，其乐融融。
    据有关部门介绍，目前全军建国前入伍的离休干部共有11万多人。为了使这些老同志老有所养，安度晚年，国务院和中央军委制定了一系列制度、规定，保证离休老干部的薪俸、住房、乘车、医疗保健、阅读文件等生活、政治待遇不低于离休前。近10年来，在国家经济不富裕、军费紧缺的情况下，军委拨出专款建成干休所千余个，安置离休干部6600户。此外，还有2.5万名军队离休干部由地方政府做了安置。各部队都投入大量人力、物力和财力，加强干休所的建设，配备了工作人员和车辆，完善了医疗保健和文化娱乐设施，热情周到地为老干部服务。各干休所普遍建立了政治学习和党的生活制度，组织离休干部到工厂、农村参观访问，开展书画、气功、跳中老年迪斯科等有益于身心健康的活动。全军开办的30多所老年大学，有1万多名老干部参加了学习。
