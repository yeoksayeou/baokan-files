Vocational education plays a crucial role in economic development, and as a result, it has garnered significant attention from many countries.

Since 1985, West Germany's product exports have consistently led the world, with an export value of $323 billion in 1988. The primary driving force behind West Germany's economic development is its advanced science and technology and labor productivity. Education, particularly vocational education, has cultivated a large number of highly skilled professionals with strong professional ethics. This has significantly improved the overall labor quality, ensured production efficiency, enhanced product quality and international competitiveness, and promoted economic development. Over 90% of West German youth, after graduating from general middle schools, directly enter vocational education. The primary form of vocational education is the "dual system," where enterprises and vocational schools closely collaborate, and practical training and theoretical learning are conducted simultaneously. Students can immediately enter production upon completing their vocational education. The West German government stipulates that students who pass the graduation exam and become skilled workers can, after several years of practical work and passing further exams, become technicians, master craftsmen, engineers, or enterprise leaders, or they can enter universities for further education and obtain a university degree.

Statistics show that from 1948 to 1982, the United States' national GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.2%, with one-third of this growth attributed to improved worker education levels and approximately half to technological innovation and skill enhancement. The practice of Motorola Corporation in the United States demonstrates that for every dollar invested in worker retraining, $30 in economic benefits can be recovered. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 1985 to 1995, the U.S. labor employment structure will undergo significant changes. Of the new jobs created, 90% will be related to the service industry. From 1986 to 2000, it is estimated that over 50 million workers will undergo training or retraining, including 21 million new employees and 30 million existing workers.

Denmark, with a population of only 5 million, has just 6% of its labor force engaged in agriculture and livestock farming. Each farmer produces enough agricultural and livestock products to support 160 people, meaning Denmark's agriculture can support 15 million people. Two-thirds of the country's agricultural and livestock products are exported annually. The rapid development of Denmark's agriculture is primarily due to long-term vocational training for agricultural and livestock workers. The Danish government mandates that young people must undergo 3 to 5 years of vocational training and obtain a government-issued training certificate before entering farms or processing plants. Additionally, they must undergo one year of practical work training before becoming formal employees.

Over the past 20 years, South Korea's economy has grown at an average annual rate of 8.4%. Economic experts believe that South Korea's rapid economic development is closely linked to its emphasis on vocational and technical education. As early as the 1960s, South Korea, to meet the needs of industrial development, focused on developing vocational and technical education as a key resource for talent development.

In 1967, South Korea enacted the "Vocational Training Law," establishing a vocational training system and forming government, enterprise, and private sector training institutions at three levels. To promote vocational training in enterprises, the government set training standards, prescribed courses and textbooks, and provided substantial financial support.

From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Singapore's economic growth rate consistently remained at 9%, with a per capita GDP reaching $6,000. A significant factor in Singapore's economic development is its workforce, which possesses specialized knowledge, high skills, and is well-trained and educated. Singapore's economic development emphasizes cooperation with multinational corporations and foreign governments to establish professional training centers, focusing on cultivating specialized talents needed for emerging industries. The country has 18 training institutions and centers offering over 60 courses related to industry, commerce, practical arts, and technical services. To ensure the implementation of vocational training programs, a "Skills Development Fund" was established. The new wage law, published in 1979, requires enterprises to deposit 2% of workers' wages into the "Skills Development Fund" account as dedicated funds for vocational training. This fund amounts to approximately 60 million Singapore dollars annually.

Additionally, the Singaporean government allocates 30 million Singapore dollars annually as training funds.

    职业教育是经济发展的基石
    钱黄生
    职业教育在经济发展中发挥着重要的作用，从而受到许多国家的重视。
    1985年以来，西德产品出口连续处于世界领先地位，1988年的出口额高达3230亿美元。西德经济赖以发展的主要力量源泉就是依靠先进的科学技术和劳动生产力，而教育，特别是职业教育，培养了大批即有熟练专业技术，又有较高职业道德的优秀专业技术工人，对提高全民劳动素质，保证生产效益和提高产品质量及其国际竞争地位、促进经济发展起到不可替代的作用。西德90％以上的青年在普通中学毕业后，都直接走上职业教育的道路。职业教育的主要形式是
  “双轨制”：企业与职业学校密切配合；实践与理论同时并举。学生在结束职业教育后可以立即投入生产。西德政府规定，凡参加职业教育的学生在通过结业考试成为技术工人后，经过几年的实际工作，通过考试还可以成为技术员、技师、工程师或企业领导人，或进入大学进一步深造，取得大学毕业文凭。
    据统计，从1948年至1982年，美国的国民生产总值年增长率为3.2％，其中1／3是通过提高职工教育水平取得的，大约1／2是通过技术革新和提高技能取得的。美国莫托罗拉公司的实践表明，对职工投入1美元的再培训费，可回收30美元的经济效益。据美国劳工统计局估计，从1985年至1995年，美国的劳动就业结构将发生巨大变化。新增加的职业中90％是与服务业有关。从1986至2000年，可能有5000多万名职工接受培训或重新培训，其中2100万名新就业人员，3000万名在职工人。
    只有500万人口的丹麦，仅有6％的劳动人口从事农业、畜牧业生产。每个农民所生产的农牧业产品可养活160人，即丹麦农牧业可供养1500万人口。这个国家的农牧业产品每年有2／3供出口。丹麦农牧业迅速发展的原因主要归功于长期以来对农牧业人员的职业培训。丹麦政府规定，青年人只有经过3至5年的职业培训，取得由政府颁发的培训合格证以后才能进入农场或加工厂，而且还需经过实际工作锻炼1年才能正式成为职工。
    近20多年来，南朝鲜经济以年平均8.4％的速度增长。经济界人士认为，南朝鲜的经济迅速发展与它大力发展职业技术教育分不开。早在60年代，南朝鲜为适应工业发展的需要，就把人才资源开发重点放在发展职业技术教育上。
    1967年南朝鲜颁布了《职业培训法》，建立了职业培训体系，形成了政府、企业、民办三级培训机构。为了推动企业开展职业培训，政府制定了培训标准，规定了课程和教材，并给以财政上的大力支持。
    新加坡从60年代起到80年代初，经济增长速度一直保持在9％的水平上，人均国民生产总值达到6000美元。新加坡经济发展的重要因素是它拥有一支有专门知识、高度技能、训练有素和受过良好教育的劳动队伍。新加坡的经济发展着重与跨国公司和外国政府合作开办专业训练中心，重点培训发展新兴工业所需要的专业人才。全国共有18个培训机构和中心，开设60多门有关工业、商业、实用工艺和技术服务的课程。为了保证实施职业培训计划，建立了“技能发展基金”。于1979年公布的新工资法要求企业将职工工资的2％存入“技能发展基金”帐户，作为企业职业培训的专款。这项经费每年大约有6000万新元。
    此外，新加坡政府每年还拨出3000万新元，作为培训经费。
