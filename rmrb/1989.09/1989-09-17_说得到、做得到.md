Recently, news has been reported that the special food supplies for central leaders have been canceled, the imported luxury cars used by central and state leaders have been replaced with domestically produced cars, and the children and spouses of high-ranking leaders have all withdrawn from circulation sector companies. These are practical actions to implement the central government's anti-corruption measures. The broad masses of the people cannot help but feel genuine joy for the Party Central Committee's good practice of "saying it, doing it."

There is a familiar song: "The Communist Party is good, the Communist Party is good! The Communist Party is the people's good leader, saying it, doing it, wholeheartedly striving for the people's sake." This practice of saying it and doing it is our Party's fine tradition. Unfortunately, some Party members and cadres have not inherited and carried forward this fine tradition well. Some people express at meetings that they will carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance, but after the meetings, they still indulge in extravagant feasting and wasteful spending; some people have the slogan of integrity and honesty on their lips, but behind their backs, they engage in corruption and bribery; some people talk about serving the public wholeheartedly, but in their actions, they always find ways to seek personal gain. There are also some units that have decisions to implement the "Regulations," measures to rectify the Party style, and plans to do a few practical things for the people, but often these are just printed on paper, spoken at meetings, posted on walls, and even published in newspapers, without being implemented in action. The broad masses of the people are very dissatisfied with this approach of merely going through the motions to appease superiors and deceive subordinates, and of doing superficial work.

At present, Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of Party members and cadres are actively responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, formulating some measures and systems to maintain integrity and combat corruption. The number of measures is not important, nor is the size of the matters. The key is to ensure implementation. If Party organizations at all levels can take the Party Central Committee as an example, say what they do and do what they say, and thoroughly rectify the bad practice of inconsistency between words and deeds and mere talk without action, then the Party's prestige among the people will be further enhanced, the broad masses of the people will further strengthen their confidence, and closely unite around the Party to strive together for the arduous tasks of revolution and construction.

### “说得到、做得到”

　　“说得到、做得到”
　　王忠本
    最近，取消中央有关领导的食品特供，中央、国务院领导使用的进口高级小轿车换为国产轿车，高层领导的子女及其配偶全部退出流通领域公司等消息不断见诸报端。这是贯彻中央廉政措施的实际行动。广大人民群众不禁为党中央这种“说得到、做得到”的好作风感到由衷的高兴。
    有首人们很熟悉的歌：“共产党好，共产党好！共产党是人民的好领导，说得到，做得到，全心全意为了人民立功劳。”这说得到、做得到的作风是我们党的优良传统。很可惜，有些党员干部对这一优良传统却没有很好地继承和发扬。有的会上表示要发扬艰苦奋斗的优良作风，会后却照样大吃大喝，铺张浪费；有的清正廉洁的口号挂在嘴上，背后却贪污腐化、收礼受贿；有的口头上大讲要一心为公，而在行动上却总是千方百计谋取个人私利。也有一些单位贯彻《准则》有决定，端正党风有措施，为群众办几件实事也有计划，但往往是印在纸上，讲在会上，贴在墙上，甚至登在报上，就是没有落实在行动上。广大群众对这种应付上头、糊弄下头、做表面文章的做法十分不满。
    时下，各级党组织和广大党员干部积极响应党中央的号召，制定了一些保持廉洁、反对腐败的措施和制度，条数不在多少，事情不在大小，关键在于抓落实。如果各级党组织都能以党中央为榜样，说到做到，彻底纠正言行不一、只说不做的坏风气，那么，党在群众中的威望就会进一步提高，广大群众就会进一步坚定信心，紧密团结在党的周围，为实现革命和建设的艰巨任务而共同奋斗。
