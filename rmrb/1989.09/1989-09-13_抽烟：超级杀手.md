	Smoking: The Super Killer
	Xiao Min

	Located in the central-southern part of Europe, Austria has a population of just over 7.5 million. However, the number of people who die from smoking each year reaches 14,000, exceeding the total number of deaths from infectious diseases, diabetes, stroke, alcohol poisoning, suicide, crime, and accidents.

	Recently, an Austrian medical organization dedicated to preventing tobacco harm held a press conference in Vienna. The aim was to raise awareness through the media about the severe harm that smoking causes to individuals and society, and to release the aforementioned shocking figures.

	Dr. Heinrich Kleisch of the organization solemnly warned those who continue to smoke: their average lifespan is reduced by 7 years compared to non-smokers.

　　肖民
    地处欧洲中南部的奥地利，人口只有750多万，但每年死于抽烟的却高达1.4万人，超过因传染病、糖尿病、脑溢血、酒精中毒、自杀、犯罪和事故而死亡的总人数。
    奥地利一个防止烟害的医生组织最近在维也纳举行记者招待会，以期通过报界宣传抽烟对个人和社会的严重危害，同时公布了上述令人吃惊的数字。
    该组织的海因里希·克莱希博士还郑重警告那些吸烟不止的瘾君子：他们的寿命平均要比不吸烟者少活7年。
