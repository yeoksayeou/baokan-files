On the evening of May 21, at 9:20 PM, five students from a certain university in Hunan, with red cloth wrapped around their heads and holding train tickets, boarded the 2nd train bound for Beijing at the Changsha Station. After boarding, they requested permission from the train conductor, Han Yi, to make a speech on the train to rally passengers to "support" the Beijing students. The train conductor Han Yi and other staff saw these deceived students and felt pity for them. They invited the students to the dining car, advised them not to be deceived anymore, and sternly stated: "We do not allow anyone to use the people's train to engage in activities against the Party Central Committee and the State Council." The five students, finding themselves at a loss for words, had to abandon their request.

The staff of the 1/2 train operated by the Changsha Passenger Section of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau have, in the midst of a serious political struggle and complex social life, firmly maintained the socialist political direction, adhered to the principle of the people's railway serving the people, resisted the impact of bourgeois ideology and erroneous behavior on the train, and composed a series of songs of integrity on the people's train.

Defending the Socialist Ideological Position on the Train

On the train, there are often people who bring yellow videotapes and audio tapes, requesting to play them on the train's closed-circuit TV and radio, claiming to "liven up life." Whenever such situations arise, the staff of the 1/2 train always firmly refuse. In July of this year, a young man brought a cassette of "International Smugglers" and, with a slick appearance, said to the broadcaster Huang Qunxiang of the 4th carriage group, "It's too boring, let's spice it up a bit, play this cassette!" Huang Qunxiang took a look and saw that the cassette had low taste and was a yellow song explicitly banned by higher authorities. She immediately pointed out, "Our train can only broadcast content that aligns with Marxism-Leninism and socialism. These things cannot be played!"

On June 5, due to the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the train was delayed at the Linxiang Station in Hunan, and the train's radio could not tune in to the Central People's Broadcasting Station, causing the train's broadcast to be interrupted. At this time, some unscrupulous individuals on the train demanded that the train broadcast "Voice of America." The train conductor and the broadcaster said, "'Voice of America' is a bourgeois radio station, and it is far from Beijing. How can its reports be true! We cannot broadcast it." This group of people then rushed to the outside of the broadcasting room, attempting to storm it. The quick-witted broadcaster immediately cut off the broadcast power, turned off all broadcast switches, pulled out the 4-core plug, and hid it on her body, preventing these people from succeeding.

Prioritizing Economic Benefits but Caring More for Passengers

In recent years, some trains, under the banner of "developing commodity economy" and "engaging in diversified operations," have gone to great lengths to increase passengers' expenses, earning more bonuses for themselves. The 1/2 train, however, has insisted on putting wholehearted service to the passengers first, sparing no effort to ensure that passengers get more benefits.

Having water to drink is a basic requirement for passengers. The 1/2 train is often overcrowded by more than 50% year-round, and during peak times, it can reach 80%. Coupled with the fact that the station sometimes cannot supply water or the train's kettle malfunctions, passengers' water supply becomes a serious issue. When such situations arise, they think of every possible way to ensure that passengers have water to drink. On one day in early July last year, under the scorching sun, the 1st train arrived at Zhengzhou Station at around 4:30 PM, and the temperature inside the carriages rose to 40 degrees Celsius. Hundreds of passengers suddenly boarded, and the hard-seat carriages were filled with passengers holding cups, waiting for water. Unfortunately, Zhengzhou Station was repairing water pipes, and the train conductor Tang Chunlian led several attendants to walk through 7 carriages to the hard-sleeper carriages to fetch boiling water. On June 5 this year, the 1st train was temporarily stopped at Huayuan Station in Hubei Province due to the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. The station was crowded, and the temperature inside the carriages reached 38 degrees Celsius, causing passengers' water consumption to surge. The water attendant Shi Yulan boiled water in two kettles, and the train stopped for two days and two nights. He boiled a total of 110 kettles of boiling water, basically meeting the passengers' needs. After two days and two nights, his hands were scorched, and his weight dropped by 6 kilograms.

Eating well and affordably is also a basic requirement for passengers. The 1/2 train cares for the passengers' needs, and the food supply is mainly mid-to-low range. Recently, they have also launched a "one-stop" boxed meal service, following the boxed meal supply with affordable and delicious radish slices, chili, tofu, century eggs, and egg soup, with no limit on quantity, allowing passengers to buy what they like to eat without spending much money.

The 1/2 train insists on not selling spoiled food and meals. On June 3 this year, the 2nd train loaded more than 700 yuan worth of beef, chicken pieces, and pork loin in Changsha, but due to the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the train was on standby. The battery used for the refrigerator ran out, and it could not be connected to an external power source. The train was on standby for three days. After departure, it was found that these food items had spoiled. The train staff decided to throw them all away, taking responsibility for the loss. That month, the train crew did not receive a single cent in bonuses.

Relieving Distress and Solving Problems

The train is severely overcrowded, and the occasional vacant sleeper berths become the object of passengers' competition. Some passengers, in order to secure a sleeper berth, do not hesitate to bribe the train conductor. Some give openly, some slip money secretly, some give cash, and some give imported high-grade cigarettes. The staff of the 1/2 train have always insisted on prioritizing the elderly, pregnant, disabled, and children, and selling the remaining berths in the order of registration. Problems that should be solved are solved; problems that should not be solved are not solved, even if gifts or money are offered. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the staff of the 1/2 train have rejected bribes hundreds of times, with a total amount of nearly 2,000 yuan and several hundred packs of cigarettes. In May of this year, a fat passenger boarded the 2nd train's hard-seat carriage from Changsha and handed a letter to the train conductor Lan Jun, saying, "Train conductor, get me a sleeper berth, please read this letter." Lan Jun opened the envelope and saw 10 "big notes," and sternly criticized, "You are trying to bribe your way to a sleeper berth, corrupting the train crew, and ruining social morality. This is wrong and unacceptable!"

The crew of the 1/2 train relieve passengers' distress and solve problems. Some passengers, to express their gratitude, offer money or gifts to the crew, but they refuse to accept any.

    列车上的正气歌
    ——记长沙铁路分局长沙客运段营运的1／2次列车
    本报记者　吴兴华
    今年5月21日晚9点20分，在长沙车站，湖南某大学的5名学生头缠红布条，手持车票，登上了开往北京的2次列车。上车后，他们向列车长韩义提出要在车上演讲，动员旅客“声援”北京学生。列车长韩义等列车工作人员看到这些受骗的学生很是心疼。他们把学生请到餐车，劝诫学生不要再受骗了，并义正辞严地说：我们不允许任何人利用人民的列车，进行反对党中央、国务院的活动。这5名学生理屈词穷，只好放弃了他们的要求。
    广州铁路局长沙客运段营运的1／2次列车的职工，在严肃的政治斗争和复杂的社会生活中，坚定地保持社会主义的政治方向，恪守人民铁路为人民的宗旨，抵制资产阶级思想和错误行为对列车的冲击，谱写出一曲曲人民列车的正气歌。
      捍卫列车的社会主义思想阵地
    在列车上，时常有人拿出黄色录相带、录音带要求在列车闭路电视、广播中播放，美其名曰“活跃生活”，每当遇到这种情况，1／2次列车工作人员总是严正拒绝。今年7月，有个年轻人拿出一盒《国际倒爷》的录音带，油头滑脑地对第4包乘组广播员黄群香说：“太单调了，刺激刺激吧，把这盒录音带放一放！”黄群香一看，这盒录音带格调低下，是上级明令禁止播放的黄色歌曲，当即指出“我们列车只能宣传符合马列主义、社会主义的内容，这些东西不能播放！”
    6月5日，因北京发生反革命暴乱，列车在湖南境内的临湘站受阻，列车收音机调不出中央广播电台，列车广播中断了。这时车上不三不四的人要求列车转播“美国之音”的广播，列车长和列车广播员说：“‘美国之音’是资产阶级的电台，又离北京那么远，它的报道哪有我们的真实！不能转播。”这伙人又涌到广播室外，企图冲击广播室。机灵的广播员马上切断广播电源，关掉所有广播开关，拔掉4芯插座，藏在身上，使这些人没有能够得逞。
          讲经济效益但更关心旅客
    近几年来，有的列车在“发展商品经济”、“开展多种经营”的招牌下，千方百计增加旅客的开支，自己多得奖金。1／2次列车却坚持把全心全意为旅客服务摆在首位，千方百计地让旅客多得实惠。
    有水喝，这是旅客的基本要求。1／2次列车常年超员50％以上，高峰时多达80％。加上车站有时水供不上，有时列车茶炉出故障，旅客喝水成了严重问题。出现这种情况，他们想方设法，首先保证旅客有水喝。去年7月初的一天，骄阳似火，1次列车下午4点多到达郑州站时，车厢内的温度升到40摄氏度，站上一下就上来几百名乘客。硬座车厢的乘客手拿杯子，等着送水。不凑巧，赶上郑州站修水管，列车长唐春莲带领几名乘务员，穿越7节车厢，到硬卧车厢茶炉提开水。今年6月5日，1次列车因北京发生反革命暴乱，临时停在湖北省境内的花园车站，人多拥挤，车厢内气温高达38摄氏度，旅客的喝水量陡然增多。茶水员石玉兰一人烧两个茶炉，列车停了两天两夜，他一共烧了110炉开水，基本满足了旅客的需要。两天两夜之后，他的手烤痛了，体重减轻了6公斤。
    吃饱，吃得实惠，这也是旅客的基本要求。1／2次列车心贴旅客，饭菜供应坚持以中低档为主。近来，他们又开展了盒饭“一条龙”服务，跟在盒饭供应后面，供应价廉物美的罗卜丁、辣椒、豆腐干、皮蛋、蛋汤，多少不限，花钱不多照样可买一样自己爱吃的菜。
    1／2次列车坚持不卖变质饭菜和食品，今年6月3日，2次列车在长沙上了700多元的牛肉、鸡块、里脊肉等，但因北京发生反革命暴乱，列车待命，供冰箱用的蓄电池的电用完了，又不能外接电源，列车一待命就是3天。开车后，发现这些餐料变质了。列车工作人员决定全部扔掉，损失由自己负责。这个月，列车员没有拿一分钱奖金。
                排忧解难
    列车严重超负，列车偶尔出现的空余卧铺成了旅客争抢的对象。少数旅客为了弄到一个卧铺，不惜给列车长行贿。有的明着给，有的暗暗塞，有的给现金，有的给进口高级香烟等物。1／2次列车的工作人员始终坚持优先照顾病、孕、残、老人和小孩旅客，其余按登记先后出售。该解决的，想办法解决；不该解决的，送礼送钱也不解决。据不完全统计，近1年来，1／2次列车的工作人员拒贿数百次、金额近2000元、香烟几百条。今年5月，一个胖子旅客从长沙登上2次列车的硬座车厢后，便交给列车长兰军一封信，说：“列车长，弄个卧铺，请看这封信。”兰车长打开信封；见是10张“大团结”，便严肃地批评说：“你用送钱的办法弄卧铺，腐蚀列车员，败坏了社会风气，这不对！也不行。”
      1／2次列车的列车员为旅客排忧解难，有的旅客为了表达感激之情，给列车员赠钱赠物，他们一概拒收。
