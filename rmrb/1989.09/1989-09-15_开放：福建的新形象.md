It is hard to imagine that in the 1970s, a Fujianese person had to explain to a European that Fujian was "across from Taiwan" to make them understand. However, in a short period, Fujian has established trade and economic-technical relations with more than 120 countries and regions.

Opening up has shaped Fujian's new image.

As early as the Song and Yuan dynasties, Fujian began engaging in foreign trade. During the Ming Dynasty, it once shone as the starting point of the "Maritime Silk Road." However, the closed-door policy of the Qing Dynasty and the gun smoke that once filled the Taiwan Strait made Fujian appear as a closed "southeastern mountain country" for a long time.

The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee proposed the policy of opening up to the outside world, opening up a smooth path for the country, and for Fujian, to the world.

In 1979, Fujian became one of the first provinces in the country to implement the "special policies and flexible measures" of opening up to the outside world. In 1988, Fujian was designated as a comprehensive reform and opening-up experimental zone. In 1989, the State Council approved Fujian to designate areas along the coast to encourage Taiwanese investors to develop.

Fujian has significant advantages in opening up to the outside world: a coastline of over 3,000 kilometers, ranking second in the country; early engagement in foreign trade, being a key overseas Chinese region with substantial overseas Chinese capital, and a strong interest in building their hometowns; close proximity to Taiwan, with 80% of Taiwanese people having ancestral roots in Fujian, sharing the same language, blood, and customs; and proximity to Hong Kong and Macau, with 700,000 Hong Kong and Macao compatriots being from Fujian.

The Fujian Provincial Party Committee firmly implements the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, creatively using the special policies and flexible measures granted to Fujian by the central government. It clearly proposes a new strategy of taking the international market as the orientation and vigorously developing an export-oriented economy.

In the early stages of opening up, Fujian paid attention to the fact that a good investment environment is an important condition for developing an export-oriented economy. In recent years, the province has raised internal funds and attracted foreign investment totaling over 6 billion yuan. Based on the existing foundation, it has accelerated the construction of ten major infrastructure projects, initially forming a three-dimensional transportation network of sea, land, and air, a modern comprehensive communication network, and a modern power transmission network with complete water and fire supply. The investment environment has significantly improved. Starting from Fujian's actual conditions to give full play to the power of the party's policies, including the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, Fujian's open cities, the Minnan Triangle, and 32 open economic counties along the coast, a multi-level, all-round, and multifunctional opening-up pattern from south to north, from the coast to the inland has been established. The coastal areas have formed a strong momentum for an export-oriented economy, driving the development and opening-up of the mountainous areas, and striving to turn resource advantages into commodity advantages and export advantages. In the past 10 years, the province's total export volume has been 3.2 times the total of the previous 30 years. The proportion of export volume to GDP has increased from 2% in 1958 and 6% in 1978 to 20% in 1988. Foreign trade has become a booster for Fujian's economic development.

Opening up has strongly impacted Fujian's outdated economic structure. In 1978, more than 90% of the province's industries were small enterprises, and fewer than 10% had equipment reaching the 1970s level. In the past 10 years, more than 10,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the province have undergone technological transformations through introducing technology and renovating existing equipment. The adjustment of the economic structure and the use of new technologies have promoted the entry of commodities into the international market. Currently, there are 14 industrial products with an export volume of over $100 million, and nearly 100 industrial products with an export volume of over $10 million. The 1,200-plus joint-venture enterprises have contributed 1/5 of the province's total output value and export volume.

After 1980, the Fujianese, who are good at commerce, once again stepped out of the country. Now, more than 190 enterprises have been established overseas, with newly signed contract amounts for engineering projects totaling $110 million, business revenue of $42.72 million, and more than 10,000 overseas labor service personnel. The above three indicators all rank first among all provinces and cities in the country. A new generation of talents with socialist ideology, daring to explore and good at management, has grown in the practice of opening up.

Farewell to the closed "southeastern mountain country."

Opening up has become Fujian's new image.

    开放：福建的新形象
    福建在哪里？
    很难想象，在二十世纪七十年代，一个福建人对欧洲人谈起这个问题时，竟要以“台湾的对面”作注，方能使对方有所领悟。然而，曾几何时，福建已同120多个国家和地区建立了贸易和经济技术关系。
    对外开放塑造了福建新的形象。
    早在宋、元年代，福建已开始外贸活动，明代曾闪烁过“海上丝绸之路”起点的光辉，但清王朝的闭关政策，台湾海峡一度弥漫的硝烟，使福建长期呈现封闭的“东南山国”形象。
    党的十一届三中全会提出对外开放政策，为共和国，也为福建开辟了走向世界的坦途。
    1979年，福建成为全国率先实行“特殊政策、灵活措施”的对外开放省份之一；1988年，福建被定为全国改革、开放综合试验区；1989年，国务院批准福建在沿海一些地区划定区域，鼓励台商投资开发。
    对外开放，福建有很大优势：海岸线长达3000多公里，居全国第二；对外通商早，是我国重点侨乡，华侨资本雄厚，热心桑梓建设；与台湾一衣带水，80％的台湾同胞祖籍是福建，语言通，血缘同，习俗相近；邻近港澳，70万港澳同胞是福建人。
    福建省委坚决贯彻党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，创造性地运用中央赋予福建的特殊政策和灵活措施，明确提出以国际市场为导向，大力发展外向型经济的新战略。
    福建在开放初期就注意到，良好的投资环境是发展外向型经济的重要条件。这几年，全省筹集内资、吸收外资，投资60多亿元，在原有基础上加快兴建十大基础设施工程，初步形成了海陆空立体运输、现代化的综合通讯和水火配置齐全现代化的电力输送网络，投资环境显著改善。从福建实际条件出发来发挥党的政策的威力，包括厦门经济特区、福州经济技术开发区、福建对外开放城市、闽南三角地带和沿海一片的32个经济开放县，一个由南至北、由沿海到内地、梯度推进的多层次、全方位、多功能的开放格局建立起来了。沿海地区形成强大的外向型经济势能，带动山区一线开发和发展，努力把资源优势转化为商品优势、出口优势。最近10年的全省外贸出口额，相当于前30年总和的3.2倍，外贸出口额占国民生产总值的比例，从1958年的2％、1978年的6％，提高到1988年的20％。外贸，成了福建经济发展的助推器。
    对外开放有力地冲击了福建陈旧的经济结构。1978年，全省工业的90％以上是小企业，设备达到70年代水平的还不到10％。最近10年，全省1万多家工交企业，通过引进技术、改造现有设备等手段，大部分进行了一遍技术改造。经济结构的调整和使用新技术，促使商品进入国际市场。目前，全省出口额达1000万美元以上的工业品已有14种，出口额超过100万美元的工业品近百种。已办起的1200多家三资企业，提供的产值和出口额都占到全省的1／5。
    1980年以后，素善商贾的福建人再度跨出国门。现在已在境外办起企业190多家，新签承包工程合同额1.1亿美元，营业额4272万美元，在外劳务人员超过1万。上述三项指标都居全国各省市第一。新一代具有社会主义思想、敢开拓、善经营的人才，在对外开放实践中成长。
    别了，封闭的“东南山国”。
    开放，成了福建的新形象。
