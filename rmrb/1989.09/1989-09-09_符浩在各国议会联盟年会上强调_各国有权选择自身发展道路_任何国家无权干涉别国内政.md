People's Daily, London, September 8th.

Chinese People's National Congress delegation leader Fu Hao spoke at the Inter-Parliamentary Union annual meeting, stating that every country's people have the right to choose a social system and development path that suits their national conditions. No foreign country has the right to interfere, criticize, or impose its own social system and values on others.

Fu Hao made these remarks this afternoon during the general debate on world political, economic, and social situations at the Inter-Parliamentary Union annual meeting.

He pointed out that in international relations, one should adhere to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, rather than any other principles.

He said that the situation in Beijing has now stabilized, and social order has returned to normal. China will better implement the policy of reform and opening up, and the independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change.

    本报伦敦9月8日电　记者陈特安报道：中国人大代表团团长符浩在各国议会联盟年会上发言，指出每个国家的人民都有权选择适合本国国情的社会制度和发展道路，任何外国无权指手划脚，说三道四，进行干涉，更不允许把自己的社会制度和价值观念强加于人。
    符浩团长是今天下午在各国议会联盟年会就世界政治、经济和社会形势进行的一般性辩论时说这番话的。
    他指出，在国际关系中，应该实行国际公认的互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，而不能是别的原则。
    他说，现在北京的局势已经稳定，社会秩序已经恢复正常，中国将更好地执行改革和开放政策，独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。
