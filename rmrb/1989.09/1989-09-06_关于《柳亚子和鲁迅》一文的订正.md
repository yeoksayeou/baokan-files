	Corrections to the Article "Gao Yuzi and Lu Xun"
	Pan Zhimin

	On August 7, 1989, the "Literary Garden Anecdotes" column in the supplement published Liu Yongping's article "Gao Yuzi and Lu Xun" (hereinafter referred to as Liu's article). There are several inaccuracies in it.

	Liu's article states: "In May 1932, due to the arrest of the couple Niu Lan and his wife by the Third International in Nanjing, Song Qingling issued a declaration demanding that the Kuomintang government release them." This statement has one historical inaccuracy and one issue with the phrasing. The couple Niu Lan and his wife were arrested in Shanghai, not Nanjing, and were later sent to Nanjing for imprisonment. Niu Lan was a staff member of the Communist International stationed in China, holding the position of secretary of the "Pan-Pacific Industrial Alliance" Shanghai office. It would be more accurate to write "Niu Lan, a staff member of the Communist International stationed in China, and his wife."

	Liu's article states: "In the October 19th entry of 'Lu Xun's Diary,' it is written: 'In the afternoon, Da Fu came and handed over two poems, one of which was written by Gao Yuzi.'" According to the context of Liu's article, this refers to October 19, 1932. However, checking 'Lu Xun's Diary,' it should be January 19, 1933. Furthermore, according to the context, the poem by Gao was written in response to Lu Xun's request at that time, which is incorrect. The poem by Gao was actually an old work from 1931, one of the "Ten Poems on the New Literary Scene." Gao clearly wrote at the end of the poem: "This is a poem sent to Mr. Lu Xun three years ago. Please review and correct it." If Liu's article had not omitted Gao Yuzi's words after the poem, it would have made it clearer that Gao Yuzi sincerely admired Lu Xun and avoided any doubts or misunderstandings about the time the poem was written. Lastly, the first line of Gao's poem, "附炎趋势苦未休," should be "附热趋炎苦未休."

	Gao Yuzi and Lu Xun were both giants of modern literature. When writing about them, one must first get the facts straight, be truthful, and meticulous, without any sloppiness.

	I hope to learn from experts and the original author with this.

### 关于《柳亚子和鲁迅》一文的订正

    关于《柳亚子和鲁迅》一文的订正
    潘志旻
    一九八九年八月七日副刊“文苑轶话”栏所载刘永平《柳亚子和鲁迅》（以下简称刘文），有若干处与史实不符。
    刘文谓：“一九三二年五月为第三国际牛兰夫妇在南京被捕入狱之事，宋庆龄发表宣言，要求国民党政府释放他们。”这段话一处史实有误，一处行文不严谨。牛兰夫妇被捕地点不是南京，而是上海，后被送往南京监禁。牛兰是共产国际派驻中国的工作人员，身份为“泛太平洋产业同盟”上海办事处秘书，应写为“共产国际派驻中国的工作人员牛兰及其夫人”更准确些。
    刘文谓：“《鲁迅日记》十月十九日日记：‘下午达夫来，交诗二笺，其一为柳亚子所写。’”依照刘文的上下文意思，此处时间指一九三二年的十月十九日，但查证《鲁迅日记》，应为一九三三年一月十九日。又，照上下文意思，柳诗是应鲁迅当时之请而作，这也不对。柳诗实为一九三一年旧作，是
  《新文坛杂咏》十首之一。柳在书此诗笺后明明白白地写有“此三年前寄怀鲁迅先生诗也。录请教正”字样。如刘文不裁去柳亚子这句诗后话，既能更让人明了柳亚子对鲁迅的诚挚推崇，又可免去对柳诗写作时间的疑虑和误解。最后，柳诗首句“附炎趋势苦未休”，应为“附热趋炎苦未休”。
    柳亚子、鲁迅均为近代文坛巨子。撰述有关他们的文字，首先应把史实弄准，实事求是，一丝不苟，马虎不得。
    愿以此就教于专家和原文作者。
