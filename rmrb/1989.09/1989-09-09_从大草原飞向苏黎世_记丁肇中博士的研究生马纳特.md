	From the Great Plains to Zurich
	- A Record of Dr. Samuel C. C. Ting's Graduate Student, Manat

	This is a dream, a dream that was conceived in the green plains of Xinjiang's Altay, Burjin County during childhood: to soar like an eagle, over mountains, out of the plains, and fly to distant lands...

	On the morning of September 26, 1988, when this 1.78-meter-tall Kazakh youth, Manat Maolinbai, passed the assessment by Professor Hofiler, the director of the Nuclear Physics Institute at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and was admitted as a graduate student of Dr. Samuel C. C. Ting, preparing to fly to Switzerland to pursue a doctoral degree, he felt that his childhood dream was about to come true.

	Manat completed his primary and secondary education at the Chinese-language school in Burjin County. In his sophomore year, when he won first place in the Altay region's mathematics, physics, and chemistry competition and brought home the award certificate, the whole family was immersed in joy. In the autumn of 1979, he was admitted to the physics department of Xinjiang University, majoring in wireless electronics. After graduation, he was fortunate to be assigned to the Third Division of the Xinjiang Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he conducted research on semiconductor sensitive devices. In 1985, the institute specially sent this Kazakh youth to Xi'an Jiaotong University to study electronic computers.

	In January 1987, the institute sent him again to the English training class at the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study for a year, further improving his English proficiency. Now, in the two or three boxes of English books he left for his younger sister Aiguli, there are traces of his diligent study. At the graduation ceremony, teachers Linda and David bid him farewell with these words: "You arrived two months late, and we were initially worried that you might fall behind, but now you have mastered standard American English."

	It was time to leave his homeland, and he sang his favorite song with a heart full of longing: "Dear mother, you raised me with your milk, I want to pursue my ideals, soaring in the vast blue sky..."

    从大草原飞向苏黎世
    ——记丁肇中博士的研究生马纳特
    这是一个梦，一个孩提时在绿色草原——新疆阿勒泰布尔津县就孕育的遥远的梦：像雄鹰那样，越过高山，飞出草原，翱翔远方……
    1988年9月26日清晨，当这位身高1.78米的哈萨克青年马纳特·毛林白，通过了瑞士苏黎世高工核物理所所长霍菲尔教授的考核，被录取为丁肇中博士的研究生，即将飞往瑞士攻读博士学位时，他感到童年的梦就要实现了。
    马纳特在布尔津县城汉语学校读完了小学、中学。高二那年，当他参加阿勒泰地区数理化竞赛获得第一名、捧回奖状时，全家人都沉浸在欢乐中。1979年秋，他从布尔津县二中考上新疆大学物理系无线电专业，毕业后有幸被分配到中科院新疆物理研究所三室，从事半导体敏感器件研究。1985年，所里特意选送这位哈萨克族青年到西安交通大学进修电子计算机。
    1987年1月，所里再次送他到中国科学院西安分院英语培训班学习一年，以进一步提高他的英语水平。如今，他留给妹妹阿依古丽那两三箱英语书中，都留下他发奋学习的手迹。结业时，琳达和戴维老师用这样的话同他告别：“你晚来了两个月，刚开始担心你跟不上，可现在你学到了一口标准的美国英语。”
    要离开故土了，他满怀依恋之情又唱起那首最喜欢的歌：“亲爱的母亲，您用乳汁把我养大，我要去追求理想，遨游在广阔的蓝天上……”　（张　郁）
