The Collected Works of Cao Yu to be Published in Installments

Cao Yu is one of the pioneers of Chinese spoken drama. His plays are renowned both domestically and internationally and continue to be performed today. In addition to writing plays, he has also engaged in various forms of creation, including novels, poetry, film, and essays. With Cao Yu's approval, the China Theatre Press has decided to publish "The Collected Works of Cao Yu," with Tian Benxiang as the chief editor. The collection will be divided into seven volumes: the first four volumes will contain his spoken drama scripts; the fifth volume will include his translated and adapted plays and film scripts; the sixth volume will feature his dramatic essays; and the seventh volume will consist of his novels, poetry, essays, and other articles, with an appendix of the author's bibliography.

The main features of the collection are as follows: First, it is comprehensive. All works that can be gathered will be included in the collection, with many works being published for the first time since the founding of the People's Republic. Second, it strives to preserve the historical originality. Post-liberation editions of Cao Yu's plays from the 1930s and 1940s, whether in selected works or standalone editions, have all been revised by the author and have multiple versions, while the first editions are very difficult to find. With the approval of Cao Yu, the editors and the publisher have decided to use the first editions (or the first published versions) for the collection. This not only gives the collection significant documentary value but also provides great convenience for researchers of Cao Yu. Third, all works have been collated against different editions and annotated where necessary, ensuring accuracy.

The first and second volumes have already been published and will soon be available to readers. The first volume includes Cao Yu's three plays created between 1933 and 1937: "Thunderstorm" (including the prologue and epilogue), "Sunrise," and "Wilderness," along with his own writings related to these plays, such as prefaces, afterwords, and notes. These three plays are reprinted from the first editions published by the Shanghai Culture and Life Press in 1936 and 1937.

The second volume includes three spoken drama scripts created by Cao Yu between 1938 and 1940, along with five related materials. These three plays are: "The Black and White" (a four-act play co-authored with Song Zhide, with the third act written by Cao Yu), reprinted from the edition published by the Chongqing Zhongzheng Press in March 1940, retaining the original preface and the cast and crew list from the first performance on October 29, 1938, in Chongqing. "Metamorphosis" (a four-act play), retaining the author's original article "Regarding the Title 'Metamorphosis'" and Ba Jin's afterword. "Beijing People" (a three-act play). The latter two plays are reprinted from the editions published by the Chongqing Culture and Life Press in 1941. The collection includes precious photographs of the author from his early years and production stills.

### 《曹禺文集》陆续出版

　　《曹禺文集》陆续出版
    曹禺是中国话剧艺术的开拓者之一。他的剧作驰誉中外，至今上演不衰。他除写剧本外，还从事小说、诗歌、电影、散文等多种形式的创作。经曹禺同志同意，中国戏剧出版社决定出版《曹禺文集》，特约田本相编纂。文集计分七卷：第一卷至第四卷为话剧剧本；第五卷为改译、翻译剧作和电影剧本；第六卷为戏剧论著；第七卷为小说、诗歌、散文和其他文章，卷末附有作者的著译年表。
    文集的主要特点：一是“全”。凡能搜集到的作品，均将编入文集，不少著作将是建国后第一次出版。二是力求保持历史的原貌。解放后出版的曹禺三四十年代剧作的选本和单行本，都经作者修改过，而且版本繁多，而初版本却很难找到。经编者和出版社征得曹禺同志的同意，文集将全部采用初版本（或初次发表本）。这不但使其具有重要的文献价值，而且给曹禺研究者们提供了极大的方便。三是所有著作都参照不同版本进行了校勘，并作了一些必要的注释，力求准确。
    第一、二卷已出版，不久将与读者见面。第一卷编入了曹禺在1933年至1937年期间所创作的《雷雨》（包括序幕和尾声）、《日出》、《原野》三部剧作，和他自己所写的有关剧本的序、跋和附记。这三个剧本分别据1936年、1937年上海文化生活出版社初版本印行。
    第二卷编入曹禺从1938年至1940年创作的三部话剧剧本和有关资料五篇。这三部剧作是：《黑字二十八》（四幕剧，与宋之的合著，第三幕为曹禺执笔），据重庆中正书局1940年3月版排印，保留了原版序言及该剧于1938年10月29日在重庆首演时的演、职员表。《蜕变》（四幕剧），原版作者写的《关于“蜕变”二字》一文和巴金的《后记》均予保留。《北京人》（三幕剧）。后两剧均据重庆文化生活出版社1941年版印行。文集插有作者早年珍贵照片和剧照。
