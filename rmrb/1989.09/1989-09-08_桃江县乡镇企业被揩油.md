Edition: 6

Last year, the total revenue of township enterprises in our county reached 265 million yuan, and the total output value of township enterprises accounted for 59% of the county's total industrial output value. They have become an important pillar of the rural economy in our county. However, in recent years, the number of units and individuals who have their eyes on township enterprises has also increased.

	The number of levies has increased, and the burden is too heavy. The Cement Factory in Huishan Port Town received 15 different levies last year, totaling 84,200 yuan. The Antimony Smelting Factory in Banxi received 20 levies, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. Many enterprises have levies of more than 100,000 yuan each year.

	Using authority to take advantage. With the rise of private housing construction, some people with certain powers have asked some township enterprises to "preferentially" supply cement, red bricks, lime, and other products. Township enterprises, for the sake of survival, have to reluctantly comply. A certain township-run brick factory last year "preferentially" supplied 3 million red bricks for private housing construction, resulting in a loss of 51,000 yuan for the enterprise. A certain cement factory supplied 750 tons of high-quality cement to a certain department at a price of 38 yuan per ton below the factory price, resulting in a subsidy of 28,000 yuan for the enterprise. One enterprise has become a gas station for some units and individuals, giving away more than 1 ton of gasoline last year. A certain unit's jeep broke down, costing 18,000 yuan to repair, and also asked a township enterprise to pay for it.

	The number of "guests" is increasing, and the level of hospitality is constantly improving. A certain township-run enterprise spent 450,000 yuan last year for hospitality and entertainment, accounting for 4% of the enterprise's annual profit.

	According to incomplete statistics, last year, various expenses for "preferential" treatment, levies, and hospitality for township enterprises in our county reached more than 2 million yuan. Please withdraw your hands, those who take advantage!

    桃江县乡镇企业被揩油
    去年，我县乡镇企业总收入达26500万元，乡镇企业总产值占全县工业总产值的59％，已成为我县农村经济发展的重要支柱。但是，近年来，在乡镇企业身上打主意的单位和个人也随之增多。
    摊派增多，负担过重。灰山港镇建材厂去年接到各种摊派15项，共计金额8.42万元。板溪锑品冶炼厂去年被摊派20项，共计金额10多万元。不少企业每年的摊派款都在万元以上。
    利用职权，贪占便宜。随着营建私房热的兴起，一些拥有某方面权力的人，便要一些乡镇企业
  “优惠”供应水泥、红砖、石灰等产品。乡镇企业为着生计，只好硬着头皮应酬。某镇办砖厂去年
  “优惠”供应私人建房红砖300多万块，企业少收入5.1万元。某水泥厂以每吨低于出厂价38元的价格，“优惠”供应某部门优质水泥750吨，企业补贴2.8万多元。有一个企业已成为一些单位和个人的加油站，去年白送汽油1吨多。某单位一辆吉普车坏了，花掉了1.8万元修理费，也要一家乡镇企业出钱。
    “客人”越来越多，招待不断升级。某乡办企业去年为招待应酬，花掉4.5万元，占这家企业全年利润的4％。
    据不完全统计，去年我县乡镇企业被“优惠”、摊派、招待用去的各种费用达200多万元。请揩油者把手收回去吧！
