The specter of poverty has long plagued the old revolutionary base areas, border regions, and islands of Fujian. By early 1986, 10% of the rural population in the province was still living in poverty. To address this issue, the Provincial Party Committee held its Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Session in May 1986, making a decisive decision to launch poverty alleviation work. It formulated a plan and proposed the requirements of "first alleviate poverty of spirit, use science and technology to lead the way, implement policies, and work down to the household level." Over the past three years, 67 preferential policies and measures to support impoverished areas have been implemented. The people in impoverished areas are deeply inspired and sing:

The east wind of poverty alleviation blows,
Like copper gongs and hammers clashing;
Mountains hear the gong sound and open silver treasuries,
Rivers hear the gong sound and shine with golden light.

Over the past three years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have devoted considerable effort to poverty alleviation work. The people in the old revolutionary base areas have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, established the concept of a commodity economy, and combined poverty alleviation with the development of an export-oriented economy. Various places have developed a number of projects that are based on local resources, require less investment, have quick results, high returns, strong momentum, and can be undertaken by every household, such as tea, fruit, forestry, edible fungi, and aquaculture and livestock breeding. The people happily sing:

Folk songs of poverty alleviation sing,
The land yields gold and water flows silver;
Reform and opening-up policies are good,
The path to prosperity is paved with hearts united.

In the process of poverty alleviation, the mindset of "waiting, relying, and asking" has been overcome, and the approach of simply providing money and goods for relief has been changed to activating internal vitality and enhancing the "blood-making" function. At the same time, funds have been "bundled" together for use. Through three years of effort, by the beginning of this year, out of the original 480,000 impoverished households in the province, 85% have basically solved the problem of subsistence, and in some places, every household has built new houses and has electric lights. People sing:

Removing the hat of poverty, they love to sing,
Songs like spring bamboo shoots cover the hills;
Sesame flowers bloom higher and higher,
Happy life warms the heart.

In the process of poverty alleviation and enrichment, the people in impoverished areas have insisted on promoting both material and spiritual civilization, achieving remarkable results. In December 1988, the National Economic Development Experience Exchange Conference for Poverty-Stricken Areas (South Region) was held in Fuzhou. In April of this year, the National Symposium on Spiritual Civilization Construction in Some Revolutionary Old Base Areas was held in Longyan City. Now, the people in impoverished areas are consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation and walking the path to common prosperity.

### 曲曲山歌唱扶贫　地出黄金水流银

　　曲曲山歌唱扶贫　地出黄金水流银
    贫困的幽灵一直困扰着福建老少边岛。到1986年初，全省农村还有10％的人口没有摆脱贫困。针对这种情况，1986年5月，省委召开了四届三次全委扩大会议，果断作出开展扶贫工作的决策，制定了规划，提出了“扶贫先扶志，科技来引路，政策要落实，工作做到户”的要求。三年来，制订了67条扶持贫困地区的优惠政策和措施。贫困地区人民深受鼓舞，歌颂道：
    扶贫政策东风吹，
    好似铜锣撞铜锤；
    山听锣声开银库，
    水听锣声闪金辉。
    三年来，省委、省政府用很大的精力抓扶贫工作。老区人民发扬自力更生、艰苦创业的精神，树立商品经济观念，把脱贫致富和发展外向型经济结合起来。各地发展一批立足当地资源、投资少、见效快、收益高、后劲足、千家万户都能干的项目，如茶、果、林、食用菌和水产畜牧养殖等。群众高兴地唱道：
      曲曲山歌唱扶贫，
      地出黄金水流银；
      改革开放政策好，
    致富大路结同心。
    在扶贫工作中，克服“等、靠、要”思想，改单纯给钱给物、救济扶贫为启动内在活力、增强“造血”功能，同时把资金“捆”起来使用。经过三年的努力，到今年初，全省原有的48万贫困户，有85％基本上解决了温饱问题，有些地方家家盖新房，户户电灯亮。人们唱道：
    摘了贫帽爱唱歌，
    歌如春笋满山坡；
    芝麻开花节节高，
    幸福生活乐心窝。
    在开展脱贫致富中，贫困地区人民坚持“两个文明”建设一起抓，成效显著。1988年12月，全国贫困地区经济开发经验交流会南方片会议在福州召开。今年4月又在龙岩市召开全国部分革命老区精神文明建设座谈会。现在，贫困地区的人民正巩固脱贫成果，走共同致富之路。　（禾　昌）
