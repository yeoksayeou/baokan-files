On June 2, the supply and marketing cooperative of Tongzi Township in our county contracted 300 tons of ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer from the Second Chemical Fertilizer Factory in Jincheng, Shanxi Province. On June 10, the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative remitted the full payment to the Second Chemical Fertilizer Factory in Jincheng. The factory immediately arranged for the shipment on June 15. However, the person in charge of railway cars and fertilizer dispatching at the factory, Song Zhiguang, repeatedly hinted to the purchasing agent of the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative that they needed to "show some consideration" for the fertilizer to be shipped on time. The purchasing agent paid no heed. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of June 14, Song Zhiguang suddenly notified the purchasing agent of the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative, "Do you know if your fertilizer is to be delivered to the East Station or the West Station of Huangshi (in fact, Huangshi Railway Station does not have an East or West Station)? The plan for this car has to be canceled. Now, if you want to ship, you have to rearrange the plan, but you have to pay a 250 yuan change fee." Knowing that Song was deliberately making things difficult, the purchasing agent of our supply and marketing cooperative had no choice but to pay the 250 yuan change fee. However, Song still delayed the arrangement. It was not until the purchasing agent of the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative presented a handwritten approval from the person in charge of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau that Song had to arrange for the shipment on July 19. But he demanded four cartons of "A Shima" cigarettes. The purchasing agent of the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative spent over 70 yuan to buy one carton of "A Shima" and over 20 yuan worth of fruit, delivering them to Song's home that night. Song did not say anything but tampered with the shipping procedures: he shipped 14.7 tons less fertilizer and additionally charged for freight and change fees, resulting in a loss of 8,250 yuan for the Tongzi Township supply and marketing cooperative.

    少送三条“阿诗玛”
    致使损失近万元
    6月2日，我县桐梓乡供销社在山西晋城市第二化肥厂联系了300吨碳铵化肥。6月10日，桐梓乡供销社将货款全部汇至晋城市第二化肥厂。厂方当即指定在6月15日调运。但是，这个厂负责火车皮和化肥调度的宋志光多次向桐梓乡供销社采购员暗示：要想化肥如期运走得“意思意思”，采购员没有理睬。不料，在6月14日下午，宋志光突然通知桐梓乡供销社采购员说：“你们化肥送达的黄石火车站不知是东站还是西站（事实上黄石火车站不分东站、西站）？这趟车皮计划只好作废。现在要运得重新安排计划，但要交250元变更费。”我供销社采购员明知是宋故意刁难，也只好交了250元变更费。但是，宋志光仍迟迟不作安排，直到桐梓乡供销社采购员拿着郑州铁路局负责人的亲笔批复，宋才不得不安排在7月19日给车皮发货。但提出要4条阿诗玛香烟。桐梓乡供销社采购员花了70多元钱，买了一条“阿诗玛”和20多元的水果，当夜送到宋志光的家里。宋没有说什么，却在办理启运手续时搞了手脚：少发了14.7吨化肥，额外多收运费、变更费等，使桐梓乡供销社损失8250元。　		湖北蕲春人民广播电台　韩进林
