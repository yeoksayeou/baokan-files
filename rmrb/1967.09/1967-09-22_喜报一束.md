The revolutionary masses of Beijing, especially the revolutionary cadres of factories and enterprises, have enthusiastically responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, swiftly achieving great unity, and are enthusiastically marching to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee to report their successes. Below are some of the reports of joy:

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, under your loving care, the two major revolutionary mass organizations have united. The times are advancing, and the motherland is leaping forward. Please rest assured, we will not disappoint your expectations. The annals of history will be written by us as a great song of praise for Mao Zedong Thought; the vast land will be arranged by us into a new world of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the twelve units and fifteen revolutionary mass organizations in our factory, with more than five thousand workers, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have sincerely communicated with each other, been strict with themselves and lenient with others, jointly eliminated factionalism, swept away selfishness, and achieved revolutionary great unity overnight.

Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the four revolutionary organizations in our machine repair factory have achieved great unity and established a revolutionary great unity group. Through discussions, we all proposed: old matters will not be mentioned again, old accounts will not be settled, responsibilities will not be pursued, and we will look forward together.

Whether or not to achieve great unity is a severe test for every revolutionary mass organization and every revolutionary cadre. We will carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter! To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and the fastest revolutionary pace, have achieved the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres in our section.

We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, consolidate our revolutionary great unity, and quickly achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in our school, concentrating our efforts on carrying out a thorough revolutionary criticism.

　　喜报一束
    北京市的广大革命群众，特别是工厂企业的无产阶级革命派，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，迅速实现了革命大联合，纷纷高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，结队到北京市革命委员会报喜。现摘抄一些喜报如下：
    毛主席呵毛主席！今天，我们两大派革命群众组织，在您老人家的亲切关怀下联合起来了。
    时代在前进，祖国在飞跃。请您老人家放心，我们决不辜负您老人家的期望。千年青史，由我们谱成伟大毛泽东思想的颂歌；万里山河，由我们安排成伟大毛泽东思想的新天下。
    毛主席呵毛主席！我们无产阶级革命派一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，努力活学活用毛主席著作，高举革命批判的旗帜，把斗争矛头直指党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。

    毛主席的最新指示发出以后，我厂所属十二个单位、十五个革命群众组织，五千多名职工，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，彼此推心置腹，严以责己，宽以待人，共同铲除山头，横扫“私”字，一夜之间实现了革命的大联合。

　　　　　　          华北电力建设公司机修厂无产阶级革命派
    搞不搞大联合，这是对我们每一个革命群众组织和每一个革命群众的最严峻的考验。我们对毛主席的指示，就是一千个照办，一万个照办！为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，以最迅速的革命步伐，实现了我段的无产阶级革命派大联合。
