	Mao Zedong Thought is the Lighthouse of the World Revolution
    On the streets of Kinshasa, the capital of Congo (Kinshasa), some young people keep a red "Little Red Book" of Chairman Mao's Quotations in their shirt pockets. These young people say: Chairman Mao's words are the truth. The "Little Red Book" helps us raise our consciousness and increase our courage to fight.

    In a university in Congo (Kinshasa), a progressive professor carries "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Little Red Book" to class. He often quotes Chairman Mao's words to answer the questions raised by students.

    A nationalist in Congo (Kinshasa) obtained a copy of the "Little Red Book" and studied it with his wife. His wife is a kindergarten teacher in Congo (Kinshasa), and she often writes down the quotations from Chairman Mao she has learned on the blackboard to teach the children to recite.

    Among the progressive people of Congo (Kinshasa), Chairman Mao's brilliant works are widely circulated. Those who have read Chairman Mao's works say: "Chairman Mao's works are as if written for the Congolese people. Reading them helps us in our struggle for genuine national independence." Some people, after obtaining a book by Chairman Mao, have not even finished reading it themselves, but many people have already come to register to borrow it. Some people are even entrusted to find Chairman Mao's photographs and works. A Congolese who has received such a commission said: The revolutionary people of Congo (Kinshasa) hold boundless respect for the great Chairman Mao Zedong, praising Chairman Mao's works as the lighthouse of the world revolution. Its radiance guides people to march forward bravely.

　　毛泽东思想是世界革命的灯塔
    在刚果（金）首都的大街上，有的青年人上衣口袋里装着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。这些青年说：毛主席的话是真理。《毛主席语录》帮助我们提高认识，增长斗争的勇气。
    在刚果（金）的一所大学里，一位进步教授带着《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》到学校里讲课。他经常引用毛主席的话解答学生们提出的问题。
    刚果（金）一位民族主义者得到了一本《毛主席语录》后，和他的妻子一同学习了这本红色宝书。他的妻子是刚果（金）一所幼儿园的教师，她经常把自己学到的毛主席语录抄在黑板上教孩子们背诵。
    在刚果（金）进步的人们中间还广泛地传阅着毛主席的光辉著作。读过毛主席著作的人说：“毛主席的著作就象为刚果（金）人民写的。读了它有助于我们进行争取真正的民族独立的斗争。”有的人得到了一本毛主席的著作，自己还没有读完，就已经有许多人前来登记借阅了。有的人则被委托去设法寻找毛主席的照片和著作。曾经受过这种委托的一位刚果（金）人士说：刚果（金）革命人民无限敬仰伟大的毛泽东主席，称颂毛主席的著作是世界革命的灯塔，它放射出来的光辉，指引着人们勇敢地前进。
