On the eve of the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association sent a telegram to the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, extending warm holiday greetings to the fraternal Vietnamese people.

The telegram said that the heroic people of North and South Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in the war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. This once again proves that U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that people's war is the most effective weapon to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The telegram said that the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, pledge to be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's July 17, 1966, "Call to Arms," and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation through to the end.
