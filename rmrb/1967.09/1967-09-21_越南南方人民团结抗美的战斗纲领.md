The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently held an extraordinary meeting and adopted a political program to further unite all the people of South Vietnam, defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on September 6 to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and the people of the South, warmly congratulating the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the issuance of its program. This vividly reflects the determination and common aspiration of the 31 million Vietnamese people to unite closely and resolutely fight for a complete victory in the war against American aggression and for national salvation.

The issuance of the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a historic event of great significance in the people's war of South Vietnam against American aggression and for national salvation. This document is a solemn proclamation denouncing the heinous crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys, a mobilization order calling on all the people of South Vietnam to strengthen their unity, further unleash the power of the people's war, and strike more powerful blows at the American aggressors and their lackeys, a declaration of the people of South Vietnam's resolve to fight on and carry the war against American aggression and for national salvation to the end, and a solemn call for the people of South Vietnam to fight shoulder to shoulder with the people of the North to liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.

The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam clearly states: "The vicious and brutal American aggressors are trampling on our country's mountains and rivers. We, the people of the South, must rise up in revolution, wage a people's war, destroy them, drive them out of our country, and regain our national independence and sovereignty. As long as American imperialism has not stopped its war of aggression, has not withdrawn all American troops and all puppet troops from our country, and has not allowed the people of the South to settle their internal affairs without foreign interference, we will resolutely fight to the end for a complete victory."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared in his letter: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is not a single American aggressor on our beloved land."

These inspiring oaths powerfully express the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to carry the war against American aggression and for national salvation to its final victory.

To carry the war against American aggression and for national salvation to the end is the main political task of the Vietnamese people at the present stage. American imperialism's mad aggression against Vietnam, its destruction of Vietnam's independence, its obstruction of Vietnam's reunification, its occupation of Vietnam's territory, and its massacre of the Vietnamese people have brought a heavy national calamity to Vietnam. American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people. Only by thoroughly defeating American imperialism's aggression and driving the American aggressors and their accomplices out of Vietnam, root and branch, can the Vietnamese people achieve complete liberation, realize the reunification of the country, and build a prosperous and powerful country. Striving for a complete victory in the war against American aggression and for national salvation is the sacred historical mission of the 31 million Vietnamese people and the paramount task of the present time for all the Vietnamese people.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole genuine representative of the people of South Vietnam and the leading force in their unity against American aggression. Over the past few years, it has, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, united the broad masses of the people of various strata and nationalities in South Vietnam and all patriotic parties, organizations, and religious circles, as well as other patriots, under the banner of the war against American aggression and for national salvation. Today, in the face of the victorious situation in the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam calls in its program for further unity of all the people and appeals to all forces in South Vietnam that are willing to oppose American imperialism and its lackeys to join and support the great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and puts forward a series of specific policies in this regard. We believe that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, hoisting high the banner of the great unity of the people of South Vietnam, will unite to the maximum all forces that can be united, isolate and strike at American imperialism and its lackeys, and will certainly lead the great war of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation from victory to new victories and achieve the great cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the country.

At present, the situation in the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation is excellent and is getting better and better. The heroic Vietnamese people, steadfast and unyielding, have fought bravely, creatively using the treasure of people's war, and have beaten the heavily armed American aggressors to a pulp, leaving them in a state of disarray and creating a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialist aggression since the end of World War II. The Vietnamese people's victorious struggle has greatly weakened American imperialism's attempt to control various parts of the world and disrupted its counterrevolutionary global strategy, making a great contribution to the cause of the world's people in opposing American imperialism.

American imperialism is already facing annihilation in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war, but it is still making its last desperate struggles. At present, American imperialism is stepping up its military adventurism, preparing to spread the flames of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula; at the same time, it continues to play the "peace talks" trick and is trying to get the United Nations to intervene in the Vietnamese question. The Soviet revisionist leadership is also hastening to collude with American imperialism, helping the American aggressors to stage the "bombing to force peace" and "bombing to lure peace" swindles, shamelessly trying to bring the Vietnamese question onto the track of capitulating to American imperialism. However, American imperialism's counterrevolutionary two-handed tactics and the Soviet revisionist leadership's accomplice activities will not be able to save American imperialism from its ultimate defeat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the period of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan: "After crossing the difficult path of war, the road to victory will open up, this is the natural logic of war." The logic of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation must also be the same. The Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation is a long and arduous one. However, the great Vietnamese people dare to struggle and dare to win, and will certainly cross the difficult path of war and enter the road to victory.

The Chinese people have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "resolutely supporting the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam." The Chinese people warmly congratulate the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the issuance of its political program. Premier Zhou Enlai, in receiving Deputy Head of Delegation Nguyen Minh Phuong, gave a high evaluation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's firm resolve to unite to the maximum all forces that can be united and carry the war against American aggression and for national salvation to the end. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Vietnamese people as a common struggle of proletarian internationalism, and are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and provide the strongest support for the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people to fight on and fight to the end until they achieve the final victory in the war against American aggression and for national salvation.

### 越南南方人民团结抗美的战斗纲领

    越南南方人民团结抗美的战斗纲领
    越南南方民族解放阵线最近举行非常会议，通过了进一步团结全体越南南方人民、战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的政治纲领。胡志明主席在九月六日写信给阮友寿主席和南方人民，热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线纲领的发表。这生动地反映了三千一百万越南人民敌忾同仇，紧密团结，决心夺取抗美救国战争彻底胜利的坚强意志和共同愿望。
    越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的发表，是越南南方人民抗美救国战争中一个具有重大历史意义的事件。这个文件，是严正声讨美帝国主义及其走狗的滔天罪行的檄文，是号召越南南方全体人民加强团结、进一步发挥人民战争的威力、更有力地打击美国侵略者及其走狗的动员令，是越南南方人民坚决打下去、誓把抗美救国战争进行到底的决心书，是越南南方人民誓与北方人民并肩战斗、解放南方、保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国的庄严号召。
    越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领明确指出：“凶恶和残暴的美国强盗正在蹂躏我们祖国的山河。我们南方人民必须起来干革命，进行人民战争，消灭它们，把它们赶出我国的国土，夺回民族的独立和主权”。“只要美帝国主义还没有停止侵略战争，没有把美国军队和所有仆从军队全部撤离我国，让南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，自己解决越南南方的内部事务，我们人民就坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    胡志明主席在信中庄严宣告：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”
    这些气壮山河的誓言，有力地表达了三千一百万越南人民把抗美救国战争坚持到最后胜利的钢铁般的决心。
    把抗美救国战争进行到底，这是越南人民在现阶段最主要的政治任务。美帝国主义对越南的疯狂侵略，破坏越南的独立，阻挠越南的统一，占领越南的领土，残杀越南的人民，给越南带来了沉重的民族灾难。美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的死敌。只有彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略，把美国侵略者及其帮凶一个不剩地从越南赶出去，越南人民才能得到彻底的解放，才能实现祖国的统一，才能建设繁荣富强的祖国。争取抗美救国战争的彻底胜利，是三千一百万越南人民的神圣的历史使命，是当前全体越南人民大于一切、高于一切的中心任务。
    越南南方民族解放阵线，是越南南方人民唯一真正的代表，是越南南方人民团结抗美的领导力量。几年来，它以工人和农民的联盟为基础，把越南南方各阶层、各民族的广大人民和各爱国党派、团体、爱国的宗教界以及其他爱国人士，团结在抗美救国战争的旗帜之下。今天，面临越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利形势，越南南方民族解放阵线在纲领中发出进一步团结全体人民的号召，呼吁越南南方一切愿意反对美帝国主义及其走狗的力量，参加和支持抗美救国的伟大斗争，并且提出了一系列有关的具体政策。我们相信，越南南方民族解放阵线高举南越人民大团结的旗帜，最大限度地团结一切可以团结的力量，孤立和打击美帝国主义及其走狗，必将使越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争从胜利走向新的胜利，并进而实现解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大事业。
    目前，越南人民的抗美救国战争的形势大好，而且越来越好。英雄的越南人民，坚强不屈，英勇奋战，创造性地运用人民战争的法宝，把武装到牙齿的美国侵略者打得头破血流，狼狈不堪，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的光辉范例。越南人民的胜利斗争，大大地削弱了美帝国主义力图控制世界各地的力量，打乱了它反革命全球战略的部署，为世界人民反对美帝国主义的事业作出了巨大贡献。
    美帝国主义已经在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中面临灭顶之灾，但是它还要作最后的垂死挣扎。目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大军事冒险，准备把侵略战火烧到整个印度支那；同时，它继续玩弄“和谈”阴谋，还企图由联合国来插手越南问题。苏联修正主义领导集团也在加紧同美帝国主义勾结，帮助美国侵略者大搞“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”骗局，厚颜无耻地要把越南问题纳入它投降美帝国主义的轨道。但是，美帝国主义的反革命两手和苏修领导集团的帮凶活动，都挽救不了美帝国主义最后失败的命运。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在中国抗日战争时期指出：“跨过战争的艰难路程之后，胜利的坦途就到来了，这是战争的自然逻辑。”越南人民抗美救国战争的逻辑也必然是如此。越南人民抗美救国战争是长期的、艰苦的。但是，伟大的越南人民敢于斗争，敢于胜利，必将跨过战争的艰难路程，进入胜利的坦途。
    中国人民一贯遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争”。中国人民热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的发表。周恩来总理在接见阮明芳代理团长时，对越南南方民族解放阵线最广泛地团结一切可以团结的力量、把抗美救国战争进行到底的坚强决心，作了高度的评价。中国人民一向把越南人民的斗争看作是无产阶级国际主义的共同的斗争，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持越南人民打下去，打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
