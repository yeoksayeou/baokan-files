During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Huainan Coal Mine, in defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, joined with revolutionary masses throughout the city to launch a fierce attack against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and those within our own unit who were taking the capitalist road. We have achieved significant victories.

Recently, we came to Beijing to learn from the revolutionary comrades in the capital about the experiences of the Cultural Revolution. At this time, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued a call to us workers on the coal industry front: to seize the revolution and promote production; to make revolution above ground and promote production below ground. These words resonate deeply in our hearts. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee truly understand the hearts of us coal mine revolutionary workers! Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee truly care for us! We will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee! We will resolutely carry out the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee! Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go! We are determined to immediately return to Huainan, make revolution on the spot, and carry the dual burdens of revolution and production even better.

After returning to the mine, we will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, unite with the broad revolutionary masses of workers, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and in the great criticism of the revolution, promote the great unity of the revolution and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution.

The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the guarantee of the Cultural Revolution, and the strong backing of our revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We will definitely raise the banner of supporting the army even higher, and cherish military-civilian unity as we cherish our own eyes. In the future, we will stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the army, unite against the enemy, and thoroughly smash all the tricks of the class enemy. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." With the support and help of the army, we will ensure coal production and strive to complete and overfulfill the production tasks given to us coal mine workers by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

    坚决响应毛主席的号召  立即回矿搞好煤炭生产
    在文化大革命中，我们淮南煤矿无产阶级革命派为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，和全市革命群众一起，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及本单位的走资本主义道路当权派发动了猛攻，并取得了重大胜利。
    不久前，我们来到北京，向首都的革命战友学习文化大革命的经验。这时，毛主席、党中央向我们煤炭工业战线职工发出了号召：要抓革命，促生产；上井闹革命，下井促生产。这些话字字句句都说在我们心坎上。毛主席、党中央多么了解我们煤矿革命职工的心！毛主席、党中央多么关怀我们！毛主席、党中央的话，我们坚决听！毛主席、党中央的指示，我们坚决照办！毛主席指向哪里，我们就干到哪里！我们决心立即返回淮南，就地闹革命，把革命和生产两副重担更好地挑起来。
    我们回到矿山后要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，在革命的大批判中促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是文化大革命的保障，是我们无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。我们一定更高地举起拥军的旗帜，象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护军民团结。今后我们要更紧密地和解放军肩并肩，心连心，团结对敌，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。我们坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在解放军的支持和帮助下，搞好煤炭生产，力争完成和超额完成毛主席和党中央交给我们煤矿工人的生产任务。
