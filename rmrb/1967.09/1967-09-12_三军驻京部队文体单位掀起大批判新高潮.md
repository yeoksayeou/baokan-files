The revolutionary cultural and sports units of the three services stationed in Beijing launch a new high tide of criticism

Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors are determined to study Chairman Mao's works even better and use them more effectively, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 11th, the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" has brought new impetus to the revolutionary criticism movement of the cultural and sports units of the three services stationed in Beijing. Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three services stationed in Beijing, who are determined to advance according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held a grand rally today to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works even better and use them more effectively, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters of China's Khrushchev from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives.

This rally is both a rally to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and an exchange meeting to share experiences in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three services stationed in Beijing first analyzed the current situation and tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the meeting. They pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved brilliant victory after victory. Currently, we are facing an unprecedentedly good situation. The counter-revolutionary line led by China's Khrushchev is on the verge of complete collapse, and revolutionary movements across the country are advancing towards victory. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article has fired a heavy blow at the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and a new high tide of revolutionary criticism to thoroughly bury the bourgeois headquarters is sweeping the nation. The most pressing and central task facing us proletarian revolutionaries is to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to further carry out revolutionary criticism, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, and in the process of revolutionary criticism, to develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The representatives, in their speeches, unanimously emphasized that carrying out revolutionary criticism is the greatest historical mission and the most severe test entrusted to us proletarian revolutionaries by the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We proletarian revolutionaries must, with the greatest loyalty, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with the highest revolutionary enthusiasm and the most rapid combat posture, concentrate our forces and targets, and further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. In this new high tide of revolutionary criticism, we will stand at the forefront of revolutionary criticism, be good warriors of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, be red commanders of revolutionary criticism, achieve new merits for the people, create new labor, and fight a people's war to thoroughly bury the bourgeois headquarters.

Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three services angrily exposed China's Khrushchev and his agents Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others, who madly opposed Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and sports. They listed numerous facts to denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in consistently resisting and obstructing Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on literature and sports; to denounce their counter-revolutionary revisionist line of so-called "mass literature"; to denounce the decayed bourgeois reactionary literary theories such as "write realism," "deepening realism," "against the determination of themes," "intermediate characters," "against gunpowder flavor," "convergence of the spirit of the times," "heresy," and so on; to denounce their crimes of opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, opposing literary and artistic workers going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and vigorously promoting "three excellences and three highs" and material incentives. They pointed out that the purpose of China's Khrushchev and his agents in promoting such a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and sports is to serve their counter-revolutionary revisionist political line of restoring capitalism. Revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three services unanimously expressed their determination to thoroughly eliminate all revisionist poisons spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the fields of literature and sports, to be completely dedicated propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over all of China and the world.

    革命文体战士决心把毛主席著作学得更好，用得更活，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
    据新华社十一日讯　姚文元同志重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》的发表，给人民解放军陆海空三军驻京部队文体单位的革命大批判带来了新的推动力量。决心紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署前进的三军驻京文体单位无产阶级革命派战士，今天举行了声势浩大的掀起革命大批判新高潮大会。革命文体战士们表示，决心把毛主席著作学得更好，用得更活，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级司令部。
    这个大会是进一步掀起革命大批判新高潮的誓师会，也是大批判中活学活用毛主席著作的经验交流会。
    陆海空三军驻京部队文体单位无产阶级革命派战士，在会上首先分析了当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势和任务。他们指出，由我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个接一个的光辉胜利，当前正面临着空前大好的形势。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命阵线正走向全面崩溃，各地的革命运动正在胜利前进。姚文元同志的文章向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部射出了重重的一炮，一个彻底埋葬资产阶级司令部的革命大批判的新高潮正在全国掀起。现在摆在我们无产阶级革命派面前的压倒一切的最中心的任务，就是更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，进一步搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，并在革命的大批判中，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    代表们在发言中一致强调指出：开展革命的大批判，这是伟大领袖毛主席和党中央赋予我们无产阶级革命派的最伟大的历史使命，是对我们的最严峻的考验。我们无产阶级革命派，必须以最大的忠诚紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以最高昂的革命热情，以最迅速的战斗姿态，集中力量，集中目标，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮。在革命大批判的新高潮中，站在革命大批判的第一线，做活学活用毛主席著作的好战士，做革命大批判的红闯将，为人民立新功，建新劳，打好一场彻底埋葬资产阶级司令部的“人民战争”。
    三军无产阶级革命派文体战士，在会上愤怒地揭露了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人周扬、夏衍之流，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大肆推行反革命修正主义文艺体育路线的滔天罪行。他们列举大量事实，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人多年来一贯抗拒、抵制毛主席关于文艺体育一系列英明指示的罪行；痛斥他们推行的所谓“全民文艺”的反革命修正主义文艺路线；痛斥什么“写真实”论，“现实主义的深化”论，“反题材决定”论，“中间人物”论，“反火药味”论，“时代精神汇合”论，“离经叛道”论等等腐朽的资产阶级反动文艺论；痛斥他们反对突出无产阶级政治，反对文艺工作者深入工农兵，大搞“三名三高”，物质刺激的罪行。他们指出，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行这样一条反革命修正主义文体黑线的目的，就是为他们的复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义政治路线服务的。三军革命文体战士们一致表示，决心彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在文艺体育领域散布的一切修正主义流毒，誓作完全彻底为工农兵服务的毛泽东思想宣传员，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远照耀着全中国，照遍全世界。
