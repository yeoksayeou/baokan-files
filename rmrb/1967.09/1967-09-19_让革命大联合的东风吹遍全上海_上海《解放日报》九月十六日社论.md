The wind is blowing, the drums are pounding, and good news is coming in frequently. As we welcome the National Day, a new high tide of revolutionary great unity has arrived in Shanghai! A new leap in revolutionary great unity has emerged! Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Since our great leader Chairman Mao made this latest directive, the wind of revolutionary great unity has blown stronger and stronger. Following the revolutionary great unity of the workers' organizations in Zhabei District, the cultural and publishing circles, the scientific and technological community has also achieved revolutionary great unity yesterday; today, the workers' organizations in Putuo District will achieve revolutionary great unity; tomorrow, more regions, more systems, and more units will achieve revolutionary great unity.

What a strong wind! In just a few days, problems that have not been solved for several months have been resolved, and batches of regions, systems, and units have achieved revolutionary great unity one after another! The units that have been notorious for their prolonged "internal wars" and severe armed struggles have also broken through numerous difficulties and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity!

The wind of revolutionary great unity blows so strongly, and the new high tide of revolutionary great unity comes so swiftly, this is not accidental. This is called: when the water flows into the canal, the melon ripens and falls off.

The wind of revolutionary great unity comes from the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, critically, and practically. Our great unity is based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the most prominent banner, the most fundamental condition, and the sharpest weapon for achieving revolutionary great unity. How to deal with the disputes and prolonged "internal wars" among various revolutionary mass organizations? There is only one way: sit down and study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind. As long as we seriously and not superficially grasp the thorough study, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. For things that violate Mao Zedong Thought and hinder revolutionary great unity, we must criticize them with Mao Zedong Thought and not allow them to spread freely. The revolutionary masses must dare to uphold the truth, making the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and the righteous spirit of Mao Zedong Thought rise, and making the evil spirits of small-bourgeois anarchism, small-groupism, individualism, etc., fall. Let the eastern wind grow stronger day by day, and the western wind grow weaker day by day.

The wind of revolutionary great unity also comes from the great criticism. The great criticism, which criticizes deeply, thoroughly, overturns, and exposes China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, is the direction of the struggle, the fundamental and greatest interest of the proletariat and revolutionary people today, the manifestation of proletarian party spirit, and the greatest principle. Only by following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, can the broad revolutionary masses recognize the unity of proletarian fundamental interests and achieve revolutionary great unity. To insist on principles, we must insist on the great criticism in this direction, not on mutual hair-pulling and mutual exposure of wounds. To pull hair and expose wounds of brother organizations is only the small-bourgeois factionalism at work, and it is definitely not the manifestation of proletarian party spirit.

The wind of revolutionary great unity also comes from the revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao's teachings and conducting serious self-criticism. Great unity requires methods, and the most fundamental method is for both sides to sit at the same table, speak openly and sincerely, and exchange hearts; it is to conduct serious self-criticism, be strict with oneself and lenient with others, rather than each holding up a "magnifying glass" to find the other's mistakes and shortcomings. Only in this way can both sides approach each other, turning negotiations into heart-to-heart talks, and heart-to-heart talks into unity. The long-term failure of two revolutionary mass organizations to achieve unity is always a problem of both sides, not just one side. One hand cannot clap.

The strong wind of revolutionary great unity greatly inspires all the revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of Shanghai, and it also poses a sharp question to the leaders of all revolutionary mass organizations that have not yet implemented revolutionary great unity: what to do? Should we follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and achieve revolutionary great unity? To cling to a small hilltop? That is unholdable; to delay and observe? There is no more time. The situation is urgent, and time waits for no one. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has grasped millions of revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary masses are all boiling with enthusiasm, determined to follow the great commander Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, catch up with the surging cultural revolution army, and no force can stop it. As a leader of a revolutionary mass organization, the only correct choice is to stand at the forefront of the movement, lead the masses forward, and make new contributions to the people in revolutionary great unity.

In this new high tide of revolutionary great unity, the working class takes the lead and is at the forefront. They are indeed the model of revolutionary great unity. They have provided an excellent example for the broad revolutionary students. Chairman Mao teaches us young people to "be willing and able to unite with workers and peasants." The revolutionary students and brave Red Guards who have played a vanguard role in the Cultural Revolution! Let us learn better from the working class, maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, overcome the small-bourgeois wavering in our ranks, strive to improve proletarian class consciousness, study hard, work hard, and make new contributions in quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and striving for struggle-criticism-transformation.

To all the warriors in the units that have already implemented revolutionary great unity! We warmly congratulate you. We unite for the revolution, and unity is for the revolution. Unity is not the end of the struggle but the beginning of a new struggle. Before us lies an extremely arduous but glorious task. Our revolutionary great unity celebration is also a mobilization meeting for further studying Chairman Mao's works, a rally for further great criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in our units. We will further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity politically, ideologically, and organizationally in the future joint struggles; thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, carry out struggle-criticism-transformation in our units, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! In the great waves of class struggle, let us temper our ranks into a highly proletarianized and highly revolutionary cultural revolution army.

Let the handful of class enemies who attempt to use various despicable means to sabotage our revolutionary great unity cry! They will be smashed to pieces in front of the iron wall of the united proletarian revolutionaries!

The red sun is in the sky, the eastern wind is surging, and the brilliant red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high in the sky of New Shanghai!

Let the strong wind of revolutionary great unity blow even more fiercely! Blow across every factory, every school, every urban and rural area, and blow across all of Shanghai!

Let us welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation with the actual actions of revolutionary great unity!

    让革命大联合的东风吹遍全上海
    上海《解放日报》九月十六日社论
    东风阵阵，战鼓冬冬，喜报频频。在迎接国庆的日子里，上海革命大联合的新高潮来到了！革命大联合的新飞跃出现了！在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。自从我们伟大领袖毛主席作出这个最新指示，革命大联合的东风越吹越强。继闸北区工人组织、文艺界、出版界的革命群众组织实现了革命大联合之后，昨天，科技界又实现了革命大联合；今天，普陀区工人组织又将实现革命大联合；明天，将有更多的地区、更多的系统、更多的单位实现革命大联合。
    好一阵强劲的东风！在短短几天里，解决了好几个月没有解决的问题，成批的地区、系统、单位一个紧接一个地实现了革命大联合！“内战”打得最久，武斗搞得最凶，全市有名的大联合的“老大难”单位，也冲破了重重困难，迅速地实现了革命大联合！
    革命大联合的东风吹得如此强劲，革命大联合的新高潮来得如此迅猛，不是偶然的。这叫做：水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落。
    革命大联合的东风，来自活学活用毛主席著作的大学习运动。我们的大联合，是在毛泽东思想原则基础上的革命大联合。毛泽东思想是实现革命大联合最鲜明的旗帜，最根本的条件，最锐利的武器。各个革命群众组织之间争执不下、“内战”连绵怎么办？办法只有一条：坐下来，带着问题学习毛主席著作。只要认真地而不是敷衍地狠抓大学习，天大的困难也解决得了。对于违反毛泽东思想、妨碍革命大联合的东西，就是要用毛泽东思想去批判，就是不能让它们自由泛滥。无产阶级革命派要敢于坚持真理，使无产阶级的革命正气、毛泽东思想的正气升上来，使小资产阶级的无政府主义、小团体主义、个人主义等等的邪气降下去；使东风日强，西风日衰。
    革命大联合的东风，还来自革命的大批判。革命大批判，把中国的赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，就是斗争大方向，就是今天无产阶级和革命人民的根本利益、最大利益之所在，就是无产阶级党性的表现，就是最大的原则。只有紧跟毛主席的战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，在这个基础上，广大革命群众才可能认识到无产阶级根本利益的一致性，从而实现革命的大联合。坚持原则，只能坚持大批判这个大方向，而不是坚持互揪辫子、互揭疮疤。对兄弟组织抓辫子，揭疮疤，这只能是小资产阶级派性在作怪，而决不是无产阶级党性的表现。
    革命大联合的东风，还来自无产阶级革命派按照毛主席的教导，各自进行认真的自我批评。大联合需要讲求方法，而最根本的方法，首先就是双方坐到一张桌子上，开诚相见，推心置腹；首先就是进行认真的自我批评，严以律己，宽以责人，而不是各自高举“放大镜”，专找对方的错误和缺点。只有这样，双方才可能互相接近起来，使谈判变为谈心，谈心变为联合。两个革命群众组织之间长期不能实现联合，总是双方的问题，而不可能仅仅是一方的问题。一个巴掌是永远拍不响的。
    革命大联合的东风，强烈地鼓舞着全上海的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，也向一切尚未实行革命大联合的革命群众组织负责人提出一个尖锐的问题：怎么办？要不要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，实现革命大联合？死抱住小山头不放吗？那是抱不住的；拖延观望呢？也已经没有时间。形势逼人，时不我待。战无不胜的毛泽东思想掌握了千百万革命群众，革命群众个个热血沸腾，决心紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，跟上浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，任何力量也无法阻挡。作为一个革命群众组织的负责人，唯一正确的抉择就是站在运动的前头，领导群众前进，在革命大联合中为人民立新功。
    在这一次革命大联合新高潮中，工人阶级一马当先，走在最前头，他们不愧是革命大联合的模范。他们特别为广大革命学生提供了极好的学习榜样。毛主席教导我们青年要“愿意并且实行和工农结合”。曾经在文化大革命中起过先锋作用的革命的学生、英勇的红卫兵小将们！让我们更好地向工人阶级学习，保持和发扬无产阶级革命精神，克服在我们队伍中存在的小资产阶级摇摆性，努力提高无产阶级的阶级觉悟，认认真真地学习，踏踏实实地工作，在迅速实现革命大联合中做出新贡献，在努力进行斗批改中做出新贡献。
    一切已经实行了革命大联合的单位的全体战士们！我们热忱地向你们表示祝贺。我们是为了革命而联合，联合起来干革命。联合决不是战斗的终结，而是新的战斗的开始。在我们面前摆着的是极其艰巨而光荣的任务。我们的革命大联合庆祝会，同时就是进一步大学毛主席著作的动员会，进一步大搞大批判和本单位斗批改的誓师会。我们将在未来的并肩战斗中，进一步从政治上、思想上、组织上巩固和发展革命的大联合；把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透、批倒、批臭，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把我们的队伍锻炼成为非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的文化革命大军。
    让一小撮企图用各种卑鄙手段破坏我们革命大联合的阶级敌人去哭泣吧，他们将在进一步联合起来的无产阶级革命派的钢铁长城面前碰得粉身碎骨！
    红日当空，东风浩荡，光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想红旗，在新上海的上空高高飘扬！
    让强劲的革命大联合的东风吹得更猛烈一些吧！吹遍每个工厂，吹遍每个学校，吹遍市区和农村，吹遍全上海！
    让我们以革命大联合的实际行动迎接建国十八周年！
