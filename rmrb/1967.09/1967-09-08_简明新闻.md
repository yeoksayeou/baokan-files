	Black Americans Bravely Resist Police Brutality

	On the night of September 4, several hundred Black residents in the Brooklyn area of New York City, upon hearing that a Black teenager had been shot dead by police without cause, took to the streets in fury and fought with the police for over two hours. They used stones, bottles, and homemade Molotov cocktails as self-defense weapons, striking back hard against the police.

	In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Black residents, despite police harassment and repeated provocations by white supremacists, have been holding daily protests since August 28, demanding an end to racial segregation in housing. The organizers of the protests have stated that they will not stop until their demands are met.

	Wave of Strikes Sweeps Uruguay

	Due to the brutal exploitation by U.S. imperialism, Uruguay is in a serious economic crisis. On September 5, high school teachers across the country went on strike to demand payment of overdue wages. At the same time, postal workers and newspaper employees also went on strike, causing mail services to halt and newspapers to stop publishing.

	This is a continuation of the recent wave of strikes sweeping across Uruguay. By early September, the number of strikers reached 400,000.

	Some Laotian Pseudo-Soldiers Rebel and Join the People

	On August 22, 34 soldiers from the pseudo-army in Savannakhet Province, Laos, recognizing the true nature of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, refused to be cannon fodder and staged a rebellion, joining the people.

	These rebel soldiers were originally stationed in Savannakhet Province's Xekong and Houaphan. Led by two platoon leaders, they attacked the camp command post and nearby guard towers, killing four reactionary officers, and then carried away a large number of weapons and military supplies, joining the liberated area.

	Israeli Aggressors Provoke Jordan Again

	According to a statement from the Jordanian military spokesman, on the morning of September 5, Israeli aggressors launched a military provocation against Jordan. Israeli forces fired from the west bank of the Jordan River towards Jordanian positions south of the Damiya Bridge. Jordanian forces retaliated, and the battle lasted for about four hours.

	Following the armed provocation by Israeli aggressors south of the Suez Canal against the United Arab Republic on September 4, Cairo Radio on September 5 called on the people to be vigilant against enemy air raids, urging citizens to control lighting at night and to store some water in case of air raids.
