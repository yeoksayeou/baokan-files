The Cultural Revolution Promotes Great Development in Production
Shandong Province's Industrial and Transportation Front Makes All-Round Leap Forward

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 23rd: The proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses of workers on Shandong's industrial and transportation front, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have, after a year of arduous struggle, thoroughly smashed the capitalist and revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong on the industrial and transportation front. They have established the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, bringing about tremendous changes in people's spiritual outlook and the appearance of enterprises, and promoting the all-round leap forward of industrial production.

Under the powerful impetus of the revolutionary locomotive of history, the total industrial output value of the province from January to August this year, on the basis of a significant leap forward last year, has increased by 12.8% compared to the same period last year. The absolute increase in output value is the highest in six years. Especially for some key products that play a major role in the development of the national economy and people's lives, such as coal, steel, pig iron, sulfuric acid, cotton cloth, machine-made paper, electric motors, and chemical fertilizers, the production levels have all seen significant improvements. The production of the textile and chemical fertilizer industries has even reached the highest levels in history. This is the result of the broad revolutionary masses, under the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction," "destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The revolutionary criticism has thoroughly exposed and criticized the capitalist and revisionist goods pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong on the industrial and transportation front. The revolutionary line of Chairman Mao for running socialist enterprises has been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions, such as breaking the foreign frameworks and taking our own path of industrial development, have been further implemented. Since this year, while accelerating the transformation of existing large enterprises and fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises, the province has also spared no effort to accelerate the construction of medium and small-sized enterprises. The ongoing revolutionary criticism has broken the situation where a few people run enterprises in a cold and desolate manner. The mass technical innovation and technological revolution movement has developed more deeply and widely. According to incomplete statistics, the province has implemented more than ten thousand major technical innovation projects. Many of these innovation projects have achieved high levels, fast speeds, and good economic results, all of which have surpassed historical levels.

　　文化大革命促进生产大发展
　　山东省工交战线生产全面跃进
    据新华社济南二十三日电　山东工业交通战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经过一年来的艰苦奋战，大破了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东代理人在工业交通战线上推行的资产阶级反动路线，大立了光焰无际的毛泽东思想，大立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使人的精神面貌和企业面貌发生了巨大变化，促进了工业生产的全面跃进。
    在革命这个历史前进火车头的强力带动下，全省今年一至八月份工业总产值在去年大幅度跃进的基础上，又比去年同期增长了百分之十二点八，绝对产值增长额，是六年来最多的一年。特别是一些对国民经济发展和人民生活起主要作用的重点产品，如煤炭、钢、生铁、硫酸、棉布、机制纸、电动机、化肥等，生产水平都有很大提高。纺织和化肥工业生产，更创造了历史上的最高水平。这是广大革命职工在人民解放军强有力的支援下坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立”，“破字当头，立也就在其中了”。革命的大批判，全面揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东代理人在工业交通战线上推行的资本主义、修正主义的货色，毛主席办社会主义企业的革命路线更加深入人心。毛主席提出的关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路等一系列的英明决策，得到了进一步贯彻执行。今年以来，全省在加速改造原有大企业，充分发挥原有企业潜力的同时，又千方百计地加速了中、小型企业的建设。正在步步深入的革命大批判，打破了少数人冷冷清清办企业的局面，群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动更加深入、更加广泛地发展起来。据不完全的统计，全省实现比较大的技术革新项目达一万多项，许多革新项目水平之高，速度之快，经济效果之好，都超过了历史水平。
