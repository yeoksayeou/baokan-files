The torrents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are sweeping away all the dens of filth and the ghosts and monsters are losing their hiding places. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the earth, exposing the true faces of the demons and monsters.

The facts fully prove: The Chinese Khrushchev is not only the mastermind behind the revisionist literary black line of the 1960s but also an active supporter and advocate of the bourgeois slogan "National Defense Literature" in the 1930s.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line."

In 1936, the left-wing literary movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas centered around Shanghai saw a major debate between Lu Xun's slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" and Zhou Yang's slogan of "National Defense Literature." This was a reflection of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for political leadership in the 1930s, and a manifestation of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the right-opportunist capitulationist line represented by Wang Ming in the literary field.

Lu Xun stood firmly on the side of the correct line represented by Chairman Mao. His slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" was a proletarian slogan.

Zhou Yang stood resolutely on the side of the erroneous line represented by Wang Ming, executing a right-opportunist capitulationist literary line. He proposed the slogan of "National Defense Literature," vigorously advocating "literature for the entire Chinese nation" without class distinctions; he claimed that the issue of leadership should not be "emphasized," that "leadership is not the exclusive property of anyone," and he attempted to eliminate proletarian leadership. He also praised Xia Yan's reactionary play "The Sing-Song Girl," calling it "a new field opened for national defense drama," and so on.

In 1935, Wang Ming published a series of articles and speeches, including "On the Revolutionary Movement and the Strategy of the Communist Party in Colonial and Semi-Colonial Countries" and "On the United Front Against Imperialism and the National Liberation Movement in China." In these articles and speeches, Wang Ming stood on the bourgeois standpoint, using right-opportunist views to interpret the anti-imperialist united front, blurring class distinctions, eliminating class struggle, advocating class cooperation, emphasizing common national interests, and promoting class capitulationism. He fundamentally denied the leadership of the proletariat in the united front.

The Chinese Khrushchev followed suit, using the pen name "Mo Wenhua," and published two open letters in the "Weekly Supplement" of the "Life Daily" on June 7 and July 12, 1936. These letters were a political program opposing Chairman Mao's correct line and promoting Wang Ming's right-opportunist capitulationist line.

In these two open letters, the Chinese Khrushchev raised a revisionist banner of the "People's Front." He emphasized that the "People's Front" was an "extremely broad" and "national" alliance of all classes. He did not mention proletarian leadership at all but shouted, "Open the door wide!" "No matter what party, what organization, or what kind of individual, you should all invite them in." He slandered our party as "discussing leadership without the united front," openly opposing Chairman Mao's correct line, eliminating proletarian leadership in the united front, and promoting the capitulationist theory of class cooperation.

Class capitulationism inevitably leads to national capitulationism. In his "open letters," the Chinese Khrushchev also directly defended traitors and collaborators, shielding and encouraging treasonous behavior. He solemnly declared: "The so-called 'scholars' who drug the people for the benefit of national enemies," "the betrayers of the Northeast," "the theorists of betrayal," are still "Chinese" and will "consider the anti-Japanese war necessary." Therefore, he instructed people, "In your criticism, you should still express a benevolent attitude, avoid some deliberately provocative language, and you should encourage them to go in a good direction." This is truly the philosophy of a traitor, collaborator, and betrayer!

On December 27, 1935, Chairman Mao gave a report titled "On the Strategy Against Japanese Imperialism" at the Party's activist conference. In this report, Chairman Mao comprehensively and deeply analyzed the changes in the political situation after the Japanese imperialists invaded China, proposing the strategic task of "building a broad national revolutionary united front." At the same time, he clearly pointed out that due to the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie, "this increases the responsibility of the Communist Party to criticize allies, expose false revolutionaries, and seize leadership." Chairman Mao also emphasized the decisive leadership role of the Communist Party and the Red Army in this united front, criticizing the narrow sectarianism and impatience with revolution that had existed in the party in the past, while also warning the entire party to be vigilant against the historical lessons of the right-opportunist mistakes of Chen Duxiu in 1927 that led to the failure of the revolution. In the resolution passed at the meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened by Chairman Mao at that time, it was clearly pointed out that "we should resolutely and unshakably fight against all tendencies of vacillation, compromise, surrender, and betrayal within the anti-Japanese united front." "The Communist Party should take the lead in the anti-Japanese front with its thorough and correct anti-Japanese and anti-traitorous words and deeds to seize leadership." Because "only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the anti-Japanese movement achieve thorough victory." The line formulated by Chairman Mao to insist on proletarian leadership, insist on independence and self-reliance, and implement a united front of struggle and unity against Japanese aggression is the only correct line.

Less than half a year after the Central Committee's resolution and Chairman Mao's instructions, the Chinese Khrushchev threw out the so-called "People's Front" bourgeois capitulationist program, which was a public challenge to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, opposing Chairman Mao's correct line. This was a serious struggle in which the agents of the bourgeoisie took advantage of the opportunity of the anti-Japanese war to seize leadership from the proletariat.

The "National Defense Literature" theory of the Zhou Yang clique and the "People's Front" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev not only have the same spiritual essence but also use many of the same words. For example, the Chinese Khrushchev said: "The People's Front" is an alliance of "all classes of the nation," while Zhou Yang said: "National Defense Literature" is "literature for the entire Chinese nation." The Chinese Khrushchev said: "Regarding the People's Front, I think the most dangerous thing is the narrow-minded and sectarian viewpoint," while Zhou Yang said: "To think that only the literature of the laboring masses is national revolutionary literature is undoubtedly harmful sectarianism and sectarianism." The Chinese Khrushchev attacked the opponents of the "People's Front" as "not understanding and underestimating the current changing situation," while Zhou Yang attacked the opponents of "National Defense Literature" as "completely not understanding the current new situation." The Chinese Khrushchev feared that insisting on a clear proletarian stance would scare away the bourgeoisie and proposed that vigilance against bad people "can scare away many people from joining the People's Front and scare you away," maliciously ridiculing those who insist on the proletarian stance: "They think that by closing the door, they can preserve their purity, nobility, arrogance, and originality." Zhou Yang also maliciously ridiculed: "If you insist on your 'purity,' fearing to be contaminated by the 'chaotic scene of many elements,' that is truly 'self-cancellation'!" Look, how consistent the tone of the Zhou Yang clique and the Chinese Khrushchev is!

The great pioneer of the cultural revolution, Lu Xun, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He immediately saw through the capitulationist face of the Zhou Yang clique and published a series of important articles, including "On Our Current Literary Movement" and "Reply to Xu Mo-Yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front." He pointed out with precision: "It is not a matter of stopping the struggle against fascism and all reactionaries that has been going on, but of deepening, expanding, making it more practical, and more subtle and tortuous, making the struggle more concrete in the struggle against Japanese aggression and traitors, and merging all struggles into the total current of the struggle against Japanese aggression and traitors. It is not a matter of the revolutionary literature abandoning its class leadership responsibility, but of making its responsibility heavier and greater." The "National Defense Literature" was thoroughly defeated under Lu Xun's fierce attack. This was a fatal blow to the capitulationist literary line and a fatal blow to Wang Ming's right-opportunist capitulationist political line.

Seeing that Lu Xun had "come out to give Mr. Zhou Yang and others a heavy criticism" and "completely overturned their theory," the Chinese Khrushchev was extremely anxious. He then carefully wrote an article titled "My View on the Significance of This Literary Debate" on September 25, 1936, still using the pseudonym "Mo Wenhua," and published it in the October 15 issue of the "Writer" magazine. This was an article attempting to stabilize the situation after the defeat of the Zhou Yang clique and launch a counterattack. The article falsely claimed that Lu Xun "did not oppose the 'National Defense Literature' as a free advocacy slogan, so the 'Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses' slogan can also be used, because it is not opposed to 'National Defense Literature.'" This is a distortion of Lu Xun. The matter is very clear: If Lu Xun did not oppose the "National Defense Literature" slogan, why did he propose the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan after Zhou Yang's "National Defense Literature" slogan? The facts clearly show: Lu Xun proposed the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan "to remedy the ambiguity of the term 'National Defense Literature' in the sense of literary thought, as well as to correct some incorrect views injected into the term 'National Defense Literature.'" In other words, to prevent Zhou Yang and others from using the banner of "National Defense" to inject bourgeois capitulationist goods. Lu Xun, with his resolute struggle, exposed the reactionary essence of "National Defense Literature." On this issue, Zhou Yang's attitude was also very clear. He said: "Outside the 'National Defense Literature' slogan, it is not possible to allow the existence of other similar slogans to assist, as long as that slogan does not hinder the united front movement in literature. 'Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses' was precisely proposed under the opposite circumstances." Therefore, he hated the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan proposed by Lu Xun to the core, even as an auxiliary slogan it was not allowed to exist, and he also incited many ghosts and monsters to attack Lu Xun without scruples.

The debate between the two slogans of "National Defense Literature" and "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" was a manifestation of the struggle between two classes and two lines on the literary front, a sharp struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for leadership on the literary front. The life-and-death struggle between the two lines "is not a matter of the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind, there is no room for compromise on the issue of line."

In the face of this confrontation, the Chinese Khrushchev took a "compromise," "fair," "mediation," and "impartial" attitude, sometimes saying that one side's "opinion is correct," and sometimes saying that he "also agrees with the other side's opinion." This is as Lenin pointed out, "to wriggle between two mutually exclusive views like a snake, trying to 'agree' with one view and 'agree' with the other view," which is "a characteristic of the whole modern opportunism in all its aspects." The Chinese Khrushchev said on the surface that the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan "can also be used," but in reality, it cannot be used. Because "can also be used" has a precondition, that is, "not opposing the 'National Defense Literature' as a free advocacy slogan" and believing that it is "not opposed to 'National Defense Literature.'" Thus, the inevitable logic is: either you consider yourself not opposed to "National Defense Literature," that is, follow "National Defense Literature" and engage in bourgeois capitulationist and national capitulationist literature, or you consider the two slogans to be opposed, then the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan is certainly not usable. The Chinese Khrushchev's article is truly "wonderful"! But is this not more exposed his evil intention to support Zhou Yang's bourgeois capitulationist literary line and oppose Lu Xun's execution of the proletarian literary line!

The Chinese Khrushchev also falsely claimed that Lu Xun's "Reply to Xu Mo-Yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" was only a criticism of the "sectarian theory and temperament" of Xu Mo-Yong, Zhou Yang, and others. This is sheer nonsense and absurd!

The matter is very clear: The "National Defense Literature" promoted by the Zhou Yang clique is not a matter of "theory and temperament," but a matter of promoting the right-opportunist capitulationist line. Lu Xun's "Reply to Xu Mo-Yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" is precisely a thorough exposure and criticism of the reactionary essence of the bourgeois slogan "National Defense Literature" proposed by Zhou Yang from a political and line perspective. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to shield the Zhou Yang clique and continue to carry out his counter-revolutionary capitulationist political line, deliberately reduced the bourgeois slogan "National Defense Literature" proposed by Zhou Yang to a matter of sectarian "theory and temperament," deliberately covering up the essence of the struggle between the two classes and two lines, and maliciously distorted the great banner of the new cultural movement, Lu Xun. This is extremely evil!

In January 1940, Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "On New Democracy," gave a thorough theoretical criticism of the right-opportunist political, military, and cultural lines promoted by Wang Ming and the Chinese Khrushchev; and he made a historical conclusion on the literary movement of the 1930s, fully affirming Lu Xun and the direction represented by Lu Xun in the new cultural movement, and thoroughly negating the bourgeois literary line of the Zhou Yang clique and the Chinese Khrushchev who supported them. Two years later, in the epoch-making genius work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao once again severely criticized the bourgeois literary line of Wang Ming and the Chinese Khrushchev. Chairman Mao's scientific summaries and revolutionary criticisms declared the bankruptcy of the so-called literature of the 1930s.

After national liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to achieve his evil goal of usurping the party, usurping political power, and usurping the military, and overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat to restore capitalism, colluded with a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the fields of politics, economy, culture, and education to actively promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. In the literary field, he placed his old partner Zhou Yang and others in important positions as his agents and, with Zhou Yang as the leader, formed a counter-revolutionary revisionist group in the literary field, promoting an anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, turning the literary field into an important stronghold for him to create counter-revolutionary restoration public opinion. This black line is the combination of bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and the so-called literature of the 1930s.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the chief culprit in advocating and reviving the so-called literature of the 1930s. During the second National Congress of Literature and Art in 1953, the Chinese Khrushchev personally took the lead in proposing to open up the so-called "excellent plays" since the May Fourth Movement and specifically named the representative plays of the so-called literature of the 1930s. After watching them, he praised them highly, saying: "Deep! Very deep! Extremely deep!" Under the strong advocacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, a large number of toxic plays and toxic films of the so-called literature of the 1930s flooded the stages and screens. Xia Yan's "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," Tian Han's "The Road to Fame," Yang Hanqing's "Li Xiucheng," and other big toxic weeds that extensively promoted the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of survival, capitulation, and betrayal were everywhere praised as flowers. "Lin's Family Shop," "Early Spring in February," "Stage Sisters," and other black specimens that revived and developed the so-called literature of the 1930s also came out in large numbers.

In conjunction with the promotion and revival of the so-called literature of the 1930s, the Chinese Khrushchev also directed his attacks at Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line and at Chairman Mao's criticism of the so-called literary black line of the 1930s. In 1956 and 1957, he repeatedly advocated: "In China, Marxism and literature have not yet been combined," "Marxism has not yet been applied to literary problems"; and he maliciously incited: "Literary figures should strive in this regard." The servants understood the master's intentions. At the expanded meeting of the Party group of the Writers' Association from July to September 1957, Zhou Yang, taking the opportunity to oppose the rightist element Feng Xuefeng, reversed the history of the struggle between the two lines on the literary front. He portrayed himself as the representative of the proletarian literary line in the 1930s, while falsely labeling the bourgeois literary line on Lu Xun. Following this, under the indulgence of the Chinese Khrushchev, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Shao Quan-lin also took the opportunity to publish the sixth volume of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun," using the same method to fabricate an annotation for "Reply to Xu Mo-Yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," thoroughly negating the proletarian slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses," and confusing right and wrong to affirm the bourgeois slogan of "National Defense Literature," turning the wrong line into the correct line and revisionism into Marxism.

After the Zhou Yang clique started this trend of reversing cases, falsified history, and literature and art history that reversed black and white also came out one after another. "History of the Development of Chinese Film," "Fifty Years of Chinese Drama Movement Materials," and "Revolutionary Literature of the Left League Period" are among the most representative works. These works deliberately belittled Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, extolled Wang Ming's opportunist line, erased the great achievements of the great banner of the cultural revolution, Lu Xun, and erected monuments for the "four gentlemen" who attacked Lu Xun, such as Zhou Yang, and elevated them to the status of "ancestors" and "old masters."

The evil wind of reviving and developing the so-called literature of the 1930s and the opportunist line planned by the Chinese Khrushchev in collusion with the Zhou Yang clique reached its peak from 1959 to 1962 during the period of temporary difficulties in China's economy. They madly clamored to use their "experience of the 1930s" to "correct our current work." This evil wind resonated with the domestic and foreign reactionaries, fiercely attacking the party and socialism, directly collaborating with the "three surrenders and one destruction," "three reconciliations and one reduction," and the capitalist restoration currents of "single farming" and "reversal of cases" initiated by the Chinese Khrushchev.

At the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" and emphasized the need to intensify class struggle in the ideological realm, dealing a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev and the Zhou Yang clique.

However, the enemy is not willing to admit defeat. Just over a month later, Zhou Yang jumped out again to defend "National Defense Literature." At the discussion meeting on "History of Modern Chinese Literature" held on November 3, 1962, he said: "Both slogans should be affirmed, both are correct, both have advantages and disadvantages." Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics immediately reminded us of the conciliatory tactics used by the Chinese Khrushchev in "My View on the Significance of This Literary Debate." It is particularly noteworthy that the old opportunist, the Chinese Khrushchev, was active behind the scenes on this issue at this time. Seeing that the anti-party face of Zhou Yang and others was about to be exposed, he attempted to repeat the old tricks of the 1930s, personally taking the lead to rescue them. Under his instructions, Lin Mo-han, a counter-revolutionary revisionist who participated in the fabrication of the annotation of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun," immediately sent someone to find the article written by the Chinese Khrushchev under the pseudonym "Mo Wenhua" in the 1930s about the debate over the two slogans, that is, "My View on the Significance of This Literary Debate." Soon, the person found the "Writer" magazine that published the article and handed it over to Lin Mo-han. In the first half of 1963, the revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, which marked the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, had already been launched. Comrade Ke Qingshi also, in accordance with the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, proposed the slogan of "writing the thirteen years" and "strongly advocating revolutionary modern plays." Seeing the wind was not favorable, Lin Mo-han returned the "Writer" magazine to the person on May 13, 1963, and repeatedly reminded in the letter to the person: "It is better not to spread this article." This is truly the heart of a thief!

The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have risen, and the doomsday of the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the party has arrived. In this situation, the person handed over the article by "Mo Wenhua" to Tao Zhu, the counter-revolutionary two-faced person who had infiltrated the Party Central Committee. Tao Zhu then handed it over to the Chinese Khrushchev and secretly plotted to counterattack. Look, the black letter of Tao Zhu, the confidant of the Chinese Khrushchev, to the person:

Comrade XX,

You sent two articles signed by Mo Wenhua, both of which have been forwarded to Comrade XX (note: that is, the Chinese Khrushchev, the same below) to read. According to Comrade XX, it can be basically determined that these two articles were written by him. If you know of any other articles published under the name of Mo Wenhua, please inform us in time. Now, the "Writer" and the "Life Daily Weekly Supplement" are returned to you. Comrade XX asked me to express his thanks to you on his behalf.

Respectfully yours,

Tao Zhu, July 1

White paper, black characters, iron-clad evidence. Look! Just as the people of the whole country were celebrating the glorious anniversary of the 45th founding of the great Communist Party of China in the midst of the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what was the headquarters of the bourgeoisie represented by the Chinese Khrushchev doing?!

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has lifted the lid on the class struggle in the literary field. The Chinese Khrushchev has been exposed! Now, people can see clearly that this Chinese Khrushchev is not only the mastermind behind the revisionist literary black line of the 1960s but also an active supporter and advocate of the bourgeois slogan "National Defense Literature" in the 1930s. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line! We must forever unswervingly follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and march forward bravely!

    中国赫鲁晓夫和所谓“三十年代文艺”		晓东　侯作卿
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，冲刷着一切藏垢纳污的巢穴，使那些牛鬼蛇神失去藏身之所。毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了大地，使那些魑魅魍魉现出了它们的本来面目。
    事实充分证明：中国赫鲁晓夫不仅是六十年代修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，而且早在三十年代就是“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号的积极支持者和鼓吹者。		一
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    一九三六年，以上海为中心的国民党统治区的左翼文艺运动，发生了鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”和周扬提出的“国防文学”两个口号的大论战。这是三十年代无产阶级与资产阶级争夺政治领导权的斗争在文艺战线上的反映，是党内以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同以王明为代表的右倾投降主义路线的斗争在文艺领域内的表现。
    鲁迅是坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的正确路线方面的。他提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，是无产阶级的口号。
    周扬是坚决地站在以王明为代表的错误路线一边的，他执行了一条右倾投降主义的文艺路线。他提出“国防文学”的口号，拚命鼓吹不分阶级的“全中国民族的文学”；胡说什么领导权问题不必“强调地提出来”、“‘领导权’不是谁专有的”，极力取消无产阶级的领导；并把夏衍歌颂汉奸、妓女的反动剧本《赛金花》，说成是“给国防剧作开辟了一个新的园地”等等。
    一九三五年，王明接连发表了《论殖民地和半殖民地的革命运动与共产党的策略》、《论反对帝国主义的统一阵线和中国民族解放运动》等文章和讲演。王明在这些文章和讲演中，站在资产阶级立场上，用右倾机会主义的观点解释反帝统一战线，抹杀阶级界限，取消阶级斗争，鼓吹阶级合作，强调全民的共同利益，宣扬阶级投降主义，根本否认统一战线中的无产阶级的领导权。
    中国赫鲁晓夫紧跟而上，用“莫文华”的笔名，在一九三六年六月七日出版的《生活日报·星期增刊》第一卷第一号和七月十二日出版的第一卷第六号上，连续发表了题为《民族解放的人民阵线》与《人民阵线和关门主义》两封给编辑部的公开信。这是中国赫鲁晓夫对抗毛主席的正确路线，推行王明右倾投降主义路线的政治纲领。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在这两封公开信中，打出了一个修正主义的“人民阵线”的旗号。他强调“人民阵线”是“极广泛的”、“全民族”的“各阶层联盟”。他绝口不提无产阶级的领导权，而大叫“把门完全打开！”“不管什么党派，什么团体，什么样式的个人，你们都要去招致来”。他诬蔑我党是“抛开统一战线来谈领导权”，明目张胆地反对毛主席的正确路线，取消统一战线中的无产阶级领导权，鼓吹阶级合作的投降主义理论。
    阶级投降主义，必然要堕落为民族投降主义。中国赫鲁晓夫在“公开信”里，还直接为汉奸卖国贼辩护，包庇和纵容卖国的行为。他郑重地宣称：“麻醉民众为民族敌人张目的所谓‘名流学者’”、“东北的出卖者”、“卖国的理论家”，也“还是中国人”，也会“认为抗日战争是必要的”。因此，他教训人们说：“你们在批评中还应表示善意的态度，应避免一些刺激感情的故意攻击的语句，你们应该鼓励他们往好的方面走。”这真是货真价实的叛徒、汉奸、卖国贼的哲学！
    一九三五年十二月二十七日，毛主席在党的活动分子会议上作了《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》的报告。在这个报告里，毛主席全面、深刻地分析了日本帝国主义打进中国以后政治形势的变化，提出了“建立广泛的民族革命统一战线”的策略任务；同时，又明确地指出，由于民族资产阶级的两面性，“这就增加了共产党批评同盟者、揭破假革命、争取领导权的责任”。毛主席还着重强调了共产党和红军在这个统一战线中的决定意义的领导作用，既批判了党内过去存在的狭隘的关门主义和对于革命的急性病，同时又警告全党注意一九二七年陈独秀右倾机会主义导致革命失败的历史教训。在当时毛主席领导召开的中共中央政治局会议上通过的《中央关于目前政治形势与党的任务的决议》中，也明确地指出“应该坚决不动摇地同反日统一战线内部一切动摇、妥协、投降与叛变的倾向做斗争。”“共产党应该以自己彻底的正确的反日反汉奸卖国贼的言论与行动去取得自己在反日战线中的领导权。”因为“只有在共产党领导之下，反日运动才能得到彻底的胜利。”毛主席制定的这条坚持无产阶级领导权，坚持独立自主，实行又联合又斗争的抗日民族统一战线的路线，是唯一正确的路线。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在党中央决议和毛主席指示以后不到半年的时间，就抛出所谓“人民阵线”的资产阶级投降主义的纲领，这是公开地对抗毛主席领导的党中央的正确领导，反对毛主席的正确路线，这是资产阶级的代理人利用抗日战争的时机向无产阶级争夺领导权的一场严重的斗争。
    周扬之流的“国防文学”理论与中国赫鲁晓夫的“人民阵线”理论不仅精神实质都是一样，而且连用的许多语言也几乎是相同的。比如中国赫鲁晓夫说：“人民阵线”是“全民族”的“各阶层联盟”，周扬则说：“国防文学”是“全中国民族的文学”。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“关于人民阵线，我觉得最危险的是狭隘的关门的观点”，周扬则说：“以为只有勤劳大众的文学才是民族革命的文学，这不用说是有害的宗派主义和关门主义”。中国赫鲁晓夫攻击“人民阵线”的反对者“是由于对目前变动了的形势不了解与估计不足”，周扬则攻击“国防文学”的反对者“完全不了解目前的新的形势”。中国赫鲁晓夫唯恐坚持鲜明的无产阶级立场会吓跑资产阶级，并提出对坏人的警惕性“可以吓退许多人参加人民阵线，也吓退你自己”，恶毒地讽刺坚持无产阶级立场的人：“他们以为把门关了”，“就可以保存他们的纯洁、清高、古傲和本色。”周扬也恶毒地讽刺说：“如果固守着自己的‘纯洁’，怕沾染了‘多元的混乱场面’，那才真是‘自己取消’”！请看，周扬之流和中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调多么一致啊！		二
    文化革命的伟大先驱鲁迅，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他一眼就看穿了周扬一伙的投降主义的鬼嘴脸，接连发表了《论现在我们的文学运动》、《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》等重要文章。他一针见血地指出：“决非停止了历来的反对法西斯主义，反对一切反动者的血的斗争，而是将这斗争更深入，更扩大，更实际，更细微曲折，将斗争具体化到抗日反汉奸的斗争，将一切斗争汇合到抗日反汉奸斗争这总流里去。决非革命文学要放弃它的阶级的领导的责任，而是将它的责任更加重，更放大”。“国防文学”在鲁迅的迎头痛击下，遭到了可耻的破产。这是对投降主义文艺路线的致命打击，也是对王明右倾投降主义政治路线的致命打击。
    中国赫鲁晓夫看到鲁迅“出来给周扬先生等人以重大的批判”，“把他们的理论完全推翻了”，真是着急非凡，于是他煞费苦心地于一九三六年九月二十五日写出一篇题为《我观这次文艺论战的意义》的文章，仍用“莫文华”的假名字，在十月十五日出版的《作家》杂志上发表出来。这是一篇企图在周扬之流战败的情况下稳住阵脚，重新进行反攻的“妙文”。文章胡说什么：鲁迅“并不反对‘国防文学’为自由提倡的口号，因此，‘民族革命战争的大众文学’口号也可用，因为和‘国防文学’并不对立的。”这是对鲁迅的歪曲。事情十分清楚，如果鲁迅“不反对”“国防文学”的口号，他为什么在周扬的“国防文学”口号之后，还要提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号？事实明白地摆着：鲁迅之所以提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，“是为了补救‘国防文学’这名词本身的在文学思想的意义上的不明了性，以及纠正一些注进‘国防文学’这名词里去的不正确的意见”。也就是说，要防止周扬们打着“国防”的旗号，“注进”资产阶级投降主义的黑货。鲁迅以他的坚决的斗争，戳穿了“国防文学”的反动实质。在这个问题上，周扬的态度也是十分明确的。他说：“在‘国防文学’的口号之外，不是不能容许别的同类性质的口号辅助的存在，只要那口号不妨碍文学上统一战线的运动。‘民族革命战争的大众文学’，就恰恰是在相反的情形之下提出来的。”因此，他对鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号恨之入骨，即使作为“国防文学”的辅助口号都不容许存在，并且还煽动众多的牛鬼蛇神，不择手段地围攻鲁迅。
    “国防文学”和“民族革命战争的大众文学”两个口号之争，是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争在文艺战线上的表现，是资产阶级和无产阶级在文艺战线上争夺领导权的尖锐的斗争。两条路线的生死搏斗，“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地”。
    在这种针锋相对的论争面前，中国赫鲁晓夫却摆出一副“折衷”、“公允”、“调和”、“平正”的态度，一会儿说这派“意见正确”，一会又说那派意见“我也十分同意”。这正如列宁所指出的，“在两种互相排斥的观点之间象游蛇一样回旋，力图既‘同意’这一观点，又‘同意’另一观点”，这是“整个现代机会主义在各个方面所表现出来的特征”。中国赫鲁晓夫表面上说“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号“也可用”，实际上是不可用。因为“也可用”是有前提条件的，这就是“并不反对‘国防文学’为自由提倡的口号”并认为“和‘国防文学’并不对立的”。这样，其必然的逻辑是：或者你自认为与“国防文学”并不对立，即跟着“国防文学”走，也去搞阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的文艺，或者你认为两个口号是对立的，那么“民族革命战争的大众文学”口号当然就不可用了。中国赫鲁晓夫的这段文章真是做得“妙”极了！但是，这不是更加暴露了他支持周扬的资产阶级投降主义文艺路线，反对鲁迅所执行的无产阶级文艺路线的险恶用心吗！
    中国赫鲁晓夫还胡说什么鲁迅的《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》，只是对徐懋庸、周扬等人的“宗派主义的理论与气质”的批判。真是满口胡言，荒谬绝伦！
    事情十分清楚，周扬之流所推行的“国防文学”，决不是什么“理论与气质”的问题，而是推行右倾投降主义路线的问题。鲁迅的《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》，正是从政治上、路线上，对周扬提出的“国防文学”这个资产阶级的口号的反动本质，给予了彻底的揭露和批判。中国赫鲁晓夫为了包庇周扬一伙，继续贯彻他的反革命的投降主义政治路线，硬把周扬提出的“国防文学”这个资产阶级的口号，仅仅归结为宗派主义的“理论和气质”问题，故意掩盖这场两个阶级、两条路线斗争的实质，并对新文化运动的伟大旗手鲁迅横加歪曲，真是恶毒之极！		三
    一九四○年一月，毛主席在他的光辉著作《新民主主义论》中，对王明以及中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的右倾机会主义的政治、军事、文化路线，从理论上给予了彻底的批判；并且对三十年代的文艺运动作了历史的结论，全面地肯定了鲁迅和鲁迅所代表的新文化运动的方向，彻底地否定了周扬一伙以及支持他们的中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级文艺路线。两年之后，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇划时代的天才著作中，又严厉地批判了王明以及中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级文艺路线。毛主席这些科学的总结和革命的批判，宣告了所谓三十年代文艺的破产。
    全国解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现他篡党、篡政、篡军，颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，他伙同一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在政治、经济、文化、教育等各个领域，积极推行一条反革命修正主义路线。在文艺界，他把三十年代的老搭档周扬之流安插在重要岗位上，作为他的代理人，并以周扬为首，组成了一个文艺界的反革命修正主义集团，推行了一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，把文艺界变成了为他制造反革命复辟舆论的重要阵地。这条黑线，就是资产阶级的文艺思想、现代修正主义的文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的结合。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是鼓吹和复活所谓三十年代文艺的罪魁祸首。一九五三年第二次全国文代会期间，中国赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，提出开放“五四”以来的所谓“优秀剧目”，并且点名要看所谓三十年代文艺的代表剧作，看完以后，极口称赞说：“深刻！很深刻！非常深刻！”在中国赫鲁晓夫的大力号召之下，一大批所谓三十年代文艺的毒草话剧、毒草电影，充斥了舞台和银幕。夏衍的《上海屋檐下》、田汉的《丽人行》、阳翰笙的《李秀成》等大肆宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学、投降哲学、叛徒哲学的大毒草到处被当作香花来吹捧。《林家铺子》、《早春二月》、《舞台姐妹》等复活和发展所谓三十年代文艺的黑标本也大批地出笼。
    与吹捧和复活所谓三十年代文艺相配合，中国赫鲁晓夫又把攻击的矛头指向毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，指向毛主席对所谓三十年代文艺黑线的批判。他在一九五六年和一九五七年一再宣扬：“在中国，马克思主义与文艺还没有结合”，“还没有把马克思主义运用于文艺问题”；并别有用心地煽动：“文艺家在这方面应当努力”。对主子的旨意，奴才心领神会。在一九五七年七月到九月的作家协会党组扩大会议上，周扬借反对右派分子冯雪峰的机会，颠倒文艺战线上两条路线斗争的历史。他把自己说成是三十年代无产阶级文艺路线的代表者，而把资产阶级文艺路线的罪名硬加在鲁迅的头上。接着，在中国赫鲁晓夫的纵容下，周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟等又借出版《鲁迅全集》第六卷的机会，用同样的手法，编造了一条《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释，彻底否定了“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的口号，混淆是非地肯定了“国防文学”这个资产阶级的口号，把错误路线说成是正确路线，把修正主义说成是马克思主义。
    周扬一伙刮起这股翻案风之后，伪造历史，颠倒黑白的艺术史、文学史也纷纷出笼。《中国电影发展史》、《中国话剧运动五十年史料集》和《左联时期无产阶级革命文学》等，就是其中最有代表性的著作。这些著作，肆意贬低毛主席的革命路线，极力美化王明的机会主义路线，抹煞文化革命的伟大旗手鲁迅的功绩，为围攻鲁迅的“四条汉子”周扬之流树碑立传，把他们抬上“祖师爷”、“老头子”的宝座。
    中国赫鲁晓夫伙同周扬之流策划的这股复活和发展所谓三十年代文艺和机会主义路线的妖风，在一九五九年到一九六二年我国经济遭遇暂时困难期间达到了高潮。他们疯狂地叫嚣要用他们“三十年代”的经验“来改正我们当前的工作”。这股妖风同国内外反动派相呼应，猖狂地向党向社会主义进攻，直接配合了中国赫鲁晓夫掀起的“三降一灭”、“三和一少”，以及“单干风”、“翻案风”等资本主义复辟的逆流。
    一九六二年九月党的八届十中全会上，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，并强调要大抓意识形态领域的阶级斗争，给了中国赫鲁晓夫以及周扬一伙以沉重的打击。
    但是，敌人是不甘心失败的。刚过一个多月，周扬又跳出来为“国防文学”辩护。他在一九六二年十一月三日召开的《中国现代文学史》讨论会上说：“应该肯定两个口号都可以用，都对，都有优点缺点。”周扬这种反革命两面派的手法，使我们立即联想到中国赫鲁晓夫在《我观这次文艺论战的意义》中所使用的折衷主义手法。特别值得注意的是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个老机会主义者，这时候在这个问题上的幕后活动。他看到周扬他们的反党面目即将暴露，于是又妄想三十年代的故技重演，亲自出马为他们解围。在他的授意下，参加编造那条《鲁迅全集》注释的反革命修正主义分子林默涵，马上派××去找中国赫鲁晓夫在三十年代化名“莫文华”所写的关于两个口号论争的文章，即《我观这次文艺论战的意义》。不久，××就把刊登这篇文章的《作家》杂志找来送交了林默涵。一九六三年上半年，江青同志领导的作为无产阶级文化大革命开端的京剧革命已经展开，柯庆施同志也根据党的八届十中全会的号召，提出大写“十三年”和“大力提倡革命现代戏”的口号。林默涵一看风头不对，就在一九六三年五月十三日把《作家》杂志退还了××，在写给××的信中一再叮咛说：“此文以不传开去为好。”真是作贼心虚！
    无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火燃烧起来了，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的末日来临了。在这种情况下，××把“莫文华”的文章又上交给混进党中央的反革命两面派陶铸。陶铸又把它交给中国赫鲁晓夫，密谋伺机反扑。请看，中国赫鲁晓夫委托他的心腹陶铸写给××的一封黑信：××同志：
    你送来两篇署名莫文华的文章，都转呈××同志（按：即中国赫鲁晓夫，下同）看过。据××同志说，大体可以断定，这两篇文章都是他写的。如你还知道其他的用莫文华的名字发表的文章，望随时告知。现将《作家》和生活日报星期增刊奉还，××同志让我代向你表示谢意。
            敬　礼！
                                      陶　铸　七月一日
    白纸黑字，铁证如山。请看！正当全国人民在无产阶级文化大革命进军声中，欢庆伟大的中国共产党诞生四十五周年的光辉节日里，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级司令部，在干什么？！
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了文艺界阶级斗争的盖子，中国赫鲁晓夫被揪了出来！现在，人们完全可以看清楚了，这个中国赫鲁晓夫不仅是六十年代修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，而且早在三十年代就是“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号的积极支持者和鼓吹者。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把中国赫鲁晓夫连同他的反革命修正主义路线彻底批倒、批臭！我们要永远坚定不移地沿着毛主席的革命路线，奋勇前进！
