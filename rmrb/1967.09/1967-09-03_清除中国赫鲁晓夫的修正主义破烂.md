The editorial departments of the magazines *Red Flag* and *People's Daily* published an article titled "To Follow the Socialist Path or the Capitalist Path?" which pointed out: China's Khrushchev, "strenuously opposes China taking the socialist path. He says things like: 'In China, taking relatively serious socialist steps is a matter for the relatively distant future,' it will take twenty years, thirty years, the time frame varies, but in any case, it will take several decades to partner with capitalists, first achieve industrialization, then nationalize industry and collectivize agriculture, 'in the future, when industry is developed and factories are numerous, production will be abundant, and then socialism can be implemented.' In short, 'when industrial production is in surplus, that is when socialism should be implemented.' What a 'time of surplus industrial production'! Surplus industrial production is a characteristic of capitalism. This reveals his wolfish ambition to develop capitalism! In fact, his line of thinking is not new; it is the same old 'theory of productive forces' that was smashed by Lenin and Stalin in the early days of the Soviet Union, advocated by the old revisionists Trotsky, Bukharin, Rykov, and others."

The inventor of the 'theory of productive forces' is the Second International revisionist Bernstein. Once this counter-revolutionary theory was concocted, it was inherited and developed by the traitors of the proletarian revolution Kautsky, as well as the representatives of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie within the Soviet Party, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Rykov, and the like. They passed it down from generation to generation, relentlessly promoting it to oppose the socialist revolution.

"Like minds think alike," revisionists have always been of one mind. Chen Duxiu once picked up this trash, using it as the 'theoretical' basis for his counter-revolutionary 'theory of the second revolution.' The set of goods that China's Khrushchev is vigorously promoting is also entirely picked from the garbage bins of opportunism and revisionism.

According to the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces,' social development is merely the natural result of the development of productive forces, and mainly the natural result of the development of means and technology of production. When productive forces are highly developed, a new social system will naturally emerge. If productive forces are not highly developed, advanced revolutionary classes should not and cannot carry out social revolutions.

According to the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces,' in a country where capitalism has not fully developed to a high level, where productive forces have not reached a high level, and where the rural economy is still dispersed and backward, the proletariat and revolutionary people should not and cannot carry out socialist revolutions.

According to the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces,' when productive forces are highly developed, capitalism can 'peacefully transition into socialism,' without the need for class struggle, without the need for proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

According to the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces,' even if the proletariat seizes power, it must first develop capitalism. Only when capitalism is fully developed and productive forces reach a high level can a socialist society be established.

In summary, the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces' is to make the laboring people content with exploitation and oppression, waiting for productive forces to mature, and then for capitalism to 'peacefully transition into socialism,' without engaging in class struggle or revolution. This is a barefaced, thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy.

Lenin once severely criticized this counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy. After the victory of the October Revolution, Menshevik Sukhanov and others brought out the old clichés sung a thousand times by the 'heroes' of the Second International, saying: "We have not yet grown to the point of realizing socialism," "We have not yet realized the economic prerequisites for socialism," "Russia's productive forces have not developed to the level of realizing socialism." Lenin sharply pointed out that Sukhanov and others do not understand the revolutionary dialectics of Marxism, do not understand the enormous role of revolution in promoting production development. Lenin pointed out: "You say that to build socialism, civilization is needed. Excellent. Then, why can't we first create the prerequisites for this civilization in our country, such as expelling the landlords, expelling the Russian capitalists, and then proceed towards socialism? In which books have you seen that the ordinary historical sequence does not allow or cannot allow such changes?"

In his brilliant philosophical work "On Contradiction," Chairman Mao deeply expounded on the revolutionary dialectical relationship between productive forces and production relations, economic base and superstructure. He pointed out: "Indeed, productive forces, practice, economic base, generally manifest as the main determining role, and whoever does not admit this is not a materialist. However, production relations, theory, superstructure, under certain conditions, also turn to manifest as the main determining role, which must also be admitted. When production relations do not change, productive forces cannot develop, then the change of production relations plays the main determining role.... When politics, culture, and other superstructures hinder the development of the economic base, political and cultural reforms become the main determining factors."

Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist proposition fundamentally destroys the 'theory of productive forces' that only talks about the level of development of productive forces and actually aims to abolish revolution.

As early as January 1940, in "On New Democracy," Chairman Mao severely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacy. Chairman Mao said: "The current world is in a new era of revolution and war, an era where capitalism is doomed to perish and socialism is destined to flourish. Under such circumstances, after the victory of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles in China, to establish a capitalist society under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, is this not sheer nonsense? At the same time, Chairman Mao pointed out that the two stages of our new democratic revolution and socialist revolution, "the first prepares conditions for the second, and the two stages must be linked, without inserting a stage of bourgeois dictatorship." Later, in his speech on the general line for the transitional period, Chairman Mao again pointed out: The establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, marked the basic end of the stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the socialist revolution.

On the eve of the victory of the people's democratic revolution in China, when the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China was about to rise in the East, Chairman Mao scientifically foresaw the enormous role of the proletarian state and advanced socialist production relations in promoting the development of productive forces. In March 1949, in the report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao severely criticized those who were pessimistic about China's future due to China's economic backwardness. In this report, Chairman Mao pointed out that with the leadership of the Communist Party of China adhering to Marxism-Leninism, with a powerful proletarian state power, with brave and hardworking revolutionary people, and with the aid of the working class of various countries in the world, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, "the speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in a short period." In this report, Chairman Mao issued a great call to the people of the whole country: "Build China into a great socialist country."

Chairman Mao's wise proposition thoroughly refuted China's Khrushchev's capitalist dream and reactionary teachings from a theoretical perspective.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction have, in fact, thoroughly refuted China's Khrushchev's capitalist dream and reactionary teachings.

After the victory of the people's democratic revolution in China, China's Khrushchev relentlessly promoted the already bankrupt 'theory of productive forces,' his wolfish ambition is clear: to use the counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces' to oppose proletarian dictatorship and socialist revolution. His butt is on the same bench as the capitalists; he thinks of developing capitalism and does what he thinks; he thinks of establishing bourgeois dictatorship and does what he thinks. He attempts to drag post-liberation New China back to the old path of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China. He is walking the path of Chiang Kai-shek, the path of Wang Jingwei.

"An ant trying to shake a tree is futile," we must warn China's Khrushchev, all your jumping around, reactionary teachings, are in vain and futile! The iron broom of the proletarian revolutionaries will definitely sweep you, this pile of filth unworthy of humanity, along with your trash—counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces'—clean out completely.

Let China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary 'theory of productive forces' go to hell!

### 清除中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义破烂

　　清除中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义破烂
　　红学
    《红旗》杂志编辑部、《人民日报》编辑部文章《走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？》中指出：中国的赫鲁晓夫，“竭力反对中国走社会主义道路。他说什么：‘在中国采取相当严重的社会主义的步骤，还是相当长久的将来的事情’，要花二十年、三十年，时间说法不一，反正要和资本家合伙几十年，先实现工业化，再搞工业国有化和农业集体化，‘将来工业化了，工厂多了，出产的东西也就多了，那就要搞社会主义了。’总之，‘将来到中国的工业生产过剩的时候，就是要搞社会主义的时候’。好一个‘工业生产过剩的时候’！工业生产过剩，是资本主义的特征。这里，一语道破了他发展资本主义的狼子野心！事实上，他这一套并不是什么新鲜货色，正是苏联建国初期被列宁、斯大林粉碎了的托洛茨基、布哈林、李可夫等老修正主义者的‘生产力论’的破烂。”
      “生产力论”的发明人是第二国际修正主义者伯恩斯坦。这个反革命理论一经炮制出来，就为无产阶级革命的叛徒考茨基，以及钻进苏联党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、布哈林、李可夫之流所继承和发展。他们代代相传，拚命鼓吹，用它来反对社会主义革命。
      “心有灵犀一点通”，修正主义者从来都是一脉相通的。陈独秀曾经拾起“生产力论”这个破烂，作为他的反革命“二次革命论”的“理论”根据。中国的赫鲁晓夫拚命宣扬的一套货色，也完全是从这些机会主义、修正主义的垃圾箱里捡来的。
    按照反革命的“生产力论”的说法，社会发展只是生产力发展的自然结果，而且主要是生产工具和生产技术发展的自然结果。生产力高度发展了，新的社会制度就会自然而然地产生。如果生产力没有高度的发展，先进的革命的阶级就不应该、也不可能进行社会革命。
    按照反革命的“生产力论”的说法，一个国家在资本主义没有充分的高度的发展的情况下，在生产力没有达到很高的水平，农村经济还很分散落后的情况下，无产阶级和革命人民就不应该、也不可能进行社会主义革命。
    按照反革命的“生产力论”的说法，社会生产力高度发展了，资本主义就可以“和平长入社会主义”，根本不需要经过阶级斗争，根本不需要实行无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
    按照反革命的“生产力论”的说法，无产阶级即使夺取了政权，也要先发展资本主义。只有在资本主义得到充分发展，社会生产力发展到很高水平之后，才有可能建立社会主义社会。
    总之，反革命的“生产力论”，是要劳动人民安心受剥削、受压迫，等待生产力发展成熟，然后资本主义“和平长入社会主义”，不要去搞阶级斗争，不要去搞革命。这是赤裸裸的、彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的谬论。
    列宁曾经严厉地批判了这种反革命修正主义的谬论。十月革命胜利后，孟什维克苏汉诺夫之流搬出了第二国际“英雄”们唱过千百次的陈词滥调，说什么：“我们还没有成长到实现社会主义的地步”，“我们还没有实现社会主义的经济前提”，“俄国生产力还没有发展到足以实现社会主义的水平”。列宁尖锐地指出，苏汉诺夫之流根本不懂得马克思主义的革命辩证法，根本不懂得革命对于促进生产发展的巨大作用。列宁指出：“你们说，为了建设社会主义就需要文明。好极了。那末，我们为什么不能首先在我国创造这种文明的前提如驱逐地主，驱逐俄国资本家，然后开始走向社会主义呢？你们究竟在哪些书上看到，说普通历史程序是不容有或不可能有这类变化的呢？”
    毛主席在他的光辉的哲学著作《矛盾论》中，精辟地阐明了生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑之间的革命的辩证关系，他指出：“诚然，生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者。然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用，这也是必须承认的。当着不变更生产关系，生产力就不能发展的时候，生产关系的变更就起了主要的决定的作用。……当着政治文化等等上层建筑阻碍着经济基础的发展的时候，对于政治上和文化上的革新就成为主要的决定的东西了。”
    毛主席这个马克思列宁主义的论断，从根本上摧毁了只讲生产力发展水平、实际上是要取消革命的“生产力论”。
    早在一九四○年一月，毛主席在《新民主主义论》一书中，就严厉地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的这种谬论。毛主席说：“现在的世界，是处在革命和战争的新时代，是资本主义决然死灭和社会主义决然兴盛的时代。在这种情形下，要在中国反帝反封建胜利之后，再建立资产阶级专政的资本主义社会，岂非是完全的梦呓？”同时，毛主席指出，我国的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段，“第一个为第二个准备条件，而两个阶段必须衔接，不容横插一个资产阶级专政的阶段”。以后，在关于党在过渡时期的总路线的讲话中，毛主席又指出：一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国的成立，标志了新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命的开始。
    在中国人民民主革命取得全国胜利的前夕，当中华人民共和国的五星红旗即将在东方升起的时候，毛主席就科学地预见到无产阶级的国家和先进的社会主义生产关系对发展生产力的巨大促进作用。一九四九年三月，在党的七届二中全会的报告中，毛主席严厉地批判了那种认为中国经济落后而对于中国前途抱有悲观论调的人们。在这个报告中，毛主席指出，有中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的领导，有强大的无产阶级的国家政权，有勇敢而勤劳的革命人民，有世界各国工人阶级的援助，在人民民主革命胜利后，“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。”在这个报告中，毛主席向全国人民发出伟大号召：“把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。”
    毛主席的英明论断，从理论上彻底地粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫走资本主义道路的梦呓和反动说教。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得的伟大胜利，从事实上彻底地粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫走资本主义道路的梦呓和反动说教。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，在我国人民民主革命取得全国胜利后，拚命地宣扬早已破产了的“生产力论”，其狼子野心是昭然若揭的。这就是：用反革命的“生产力论”，反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义革命。他的屁股是和资本家坐在一条板凳上的，他想的是发展资本主义，干的是发展资本主义；想的是建立资产阶级专政，干的是建立资产阶级专政。他企图把人民民主革命胜利后的新中国，拉回半殖民地半封建旧中国的老路上去。他走的是蒋介石的道路，汪精卫的道路。
      “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，我们要正告中国的赫鲁晓夫，你的全部跳梁表演，反动说教，都是无济于事、枉费心机的！无产阶级革命派的铁扫帚，一定要把你这个不齿于人类的狗屎堆，连同你那个破烂——反革命的“生产力论”，通通扫除干净。
    让中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命的“生产力论”见鬼去吧！
