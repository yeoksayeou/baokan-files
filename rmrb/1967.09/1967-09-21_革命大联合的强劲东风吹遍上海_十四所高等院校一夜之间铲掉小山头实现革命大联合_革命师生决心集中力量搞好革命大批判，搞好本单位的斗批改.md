The powerful east wind of revolutionary great unity sweeps across Shanghai. In one night, fourteen institutions of higher learning have eliminated their small factions and achieved revolutionary great unity. Revolutionary teachers and students are determined to concentrate their efforts on carrying out a thorough revolutionary criticism, and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 20th, our correspondent comments: Following the revolutionary great unity movement initiated by the working class of Shanghai, the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shanghai's institutions of higher learning, following the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, have learned from the revolutionary spirit of the working class. In the midst of revolutionary criticism, they have launched a new wave of revolutionary great unity, further advancing the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanghai.

On the night of the 18th to the 19th, in just one night, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Fudan University, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai University of Science and Technology, Shanghai First Medical College, Shanghai Institute of Technology, East China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Physical Education, Shanghai Railway Medical College, Shanghai Railway College, Shanghai Second Medical College, and Shanghai Foreign Language Institute—14 institutions of higher learning—successively achieved revolutionary great unity. Together with Tongji University, East China Normal University, Shanghai Fisheries College, Shanghai Maritime College, Shanghai Drama Academy, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and other institutions that had previously achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," Shanghai now has 20 institutions of higher learning that have achieved revolutionary great unity, accounting for more than four-fifths of the total number of full-time institutions of higher learning. This is a brilliant victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

On the 14th, the People's Daily published a commentary conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. This instruction, like a powerful east wind, swept across Shanghai. The working class took the lead, standing at the forefront of the revolutionary great unity movement. Shanghai Normal University, which had the most intense "internal strife" among Shanghai's institutions of higher learning, was the first to learn from the shining example of the working class of Shanghai. Both revolutionary mass organizations abandoned their prejudices, had an open and frank discussion, and successfully reached an agreement in one night to implement great unity. That night, they convened a meeting of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff from the entire school and established a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire school. This news gave a great boost and inspiration to the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of all institutions of higher learning in the city. Representatives of revolutionary mass organizations from many schools who attended the meeting to establish the unified revolutionary mass organization of Shanghai Normal University returned to their schools and, with a sense of urgency, immediately began negotiations with each other and unconditionally united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The new surge of revolutionary great unity in Shanghai's institutions of higher learning is a great achievement of the proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards of Shanghai's institutions of higher learning in resolutely and swiftly implementing the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. Many Red Guards of institutions of higher learning, in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity this time, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They understood that achieving revolutionary great unity is the most crucial issue at present.

The exemplary actions of the Shanghai working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, in the new surge of revolutionary great unity, had a great inspirational and encouraging effect on the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shanghai's institutions of higher learning. The Red Guards of Fudan University said: The workers of Shanghai are following Chairman Mao's latest instructions and launching a new surge of revolutionary great unity. In such a good situation, we must make a great leap forward. On the morning of the 19th, the leaders of the two Red Guard organizations of this university gathered together, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and immediately expressed their determination to achieve revolutionary great unity. That evening, they established a unified Red Guard organization for the entire school.

The new surge of revolutionary great unity in Shanghai's institutions of higher learning is the result of the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, strengthening their proletarian party spirit, and overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism. The leaders of the "Fight to the End" Brigade of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticized their past erroneous view of wanting to be the "core" in the issue of revolutionary great unity. The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Red Guard Teachers' (preparatory) organization, which had previously had differences with the "Fight to the End" Brigade, also criticized itself. In this way, the two Red Guard organizations united under the great call of Chairman Mao and established a unified Red Guard organization. The entire school also established a unified revolutionary mass organization. Many revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of institutions of higher learning said that overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism is a "battle of breakthroughs" to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit. One must free oneself from the "self" and abandon the infatuation with small factions. The leaders of the two originally opposing Red Guard organizations of Shanghai Mechanical Engineering Institute went to the masses in the opposing organizations who had the most objections to them, listened to sharp criticisms, and corrected their shortcomings and errors. In the meetings discussing revolutionary great unity, many leaders of Red Guard organizations and revolutionary mass organizations of schools, after intense struggles between "public" and "private," decided to eliminate small factions and, in the great unity, not to calculate positions and not to compete for quotas. The new storm of revolutionary great unity has raised the political and ideological level of the proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai's institutions of higher learning to a new height.

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shanghai's institutions of higher learning expressed that after achieving revolutionary great unity in organization, they must also continuously consolidate and improve it in thought. Only by achieving great unity in thought can organizational great unity withstand the test of storms and waves. We must see that a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and all class enemies are most afraid of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. We must be a hundred times more vigilant against the class enemies' sabotage of our revolutionary great unity and never let their plots succeed. Many revolutionary teachers and students expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, and thoroughly criticize and expose politically, ideologically, and theoretically the Chinese Khrushchev, combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, further carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　革命大联合的强劲东风吹遍上海
    十四所高等院校一夜之间铲掉小山头实现革命大联合
　　革命师生决心集中力量搞好革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改
    据新华社上海二十日电　本社记者述评：继上海工人阶级掀起革命大联合高潮之后，上海高等学校的红卫兵小将和广大革命师生员工，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署，学习工人阶级的革命精神，在革命大批判中，掀起了革命大联合的新高潮，使上海无产阶级革命派大联合又大大跃进了一步。
    十八日晚至十九日，一夜之间，就有上海交通大学、复旦大学、上海师范学院、上海科学技术大学、上海第一医学院、上海工学院、华东政法学院、上海财经学院、上海机械学院、上海体育学院、上海铁道医学院、上海铁道学院、上海第二医学院、上海外国语学院等十四所高等院校，相继实现了革命的大联合。至此，连同过去已经实现革命大联合和革命“三结合”的同济大学、华东师范大学、上海水产学院、上海海运学院、上海戏剧学院、上海音乐学院，上海已有二十所高等院校实现了革命的大联合，占全日制高等院校总数的五分之四以上。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    《人民日报》在十四日社论中传达了毛主席的最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。这一指示象强劲的东风吹遍了上海。工人阶级一马当先，走在革命大联合高潮的最前面，曾经是上海高等学校“内战”最为剧烈的上海师范学院，两大革命群众组织首先学习上海工人阶级的光辉榜样，双方抛弃成见，开诚布公，一夜之间协商成功，实行了大联合，并于当夜就召开了全校革命师生员工大会，成立了全校统一的革命群众组织。这个喜讯，给全市高等院校广大革命师生员工以巨大的推动和鼓舞。参加上海师范学院成立全校统一革命群众组织大会的许多学校的革命群众组织的代表，一回到学校，就以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，雷厉风行，相互立即进行协商，无条件地在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来。
    上海高等学校出现的革命大联合的新高涨，是上海高等学校无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将坚决、迅速地执行伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的巨大成果。许多高等学校的红卫兵小将，在这次实现革命大联合的过程中，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示。他们理解到：实现革命的大联合，是当前最关键的问题。
    具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级在革命大联合新的高涨中的模范行动，对上海高等学校的红卫兵小将和广大革命师生员工，起了极大的激励和鼓舞作用。复旦大学的红卫兵小将说：上海工人紧跟毛主席最新指示，掀起革命大联合新高潮。在这样一派大好形势下，我们一定要来一个大飞跃。十九日清晨，这个大学的两个红卫兵组织的负责人共聚一堂，学习了毛主席的最新指示后，立刻表示要实现革命大联合。他们当晚就成立了全校统一的红卫兵组织。
    上海高等学校出现的革命大联合的新高涨，是红卫兵小将和广大革命师生员工活学活用毛主席著作，增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性的结果。交通大学“反到底”兵团的负责人，听到毛主席的最新指示后，对过去在革命大联合问题上要“以我为核心”的错误观点，作了自我批评。原来和“反到底”兵团有分歧的交通大学红卫兵师（筹），也作了自我批评。这样，两个红卫兵组织在毛主席的伟大号召下，终于联合起来，成立了统一的红卫兵组织。全校也成立了统一的革命群众组织。许多高等学校的革命师生员工说，克服小资产阶级的派性，是一场破私立公的“攻坚战”，要从“私”字中解放出来，抛弃对小山头的“迷恋”，必须勇于自我革命。上海机械学院两个原来对立的红卫兵组织的负责人，都到对方组织中对自己意见最大的群众中去，听取尖锐的批评，改正自己的缺点错误。在讨论革命大联合的会议上，不少学校的红卫兵组织和革命群众组织的负责人，经过激烈的“公”与“私”的斗争，决心铲除小山头，在大联合中不计席位，不争名额。革命大联合的新风暴，使上海高等学校的无产阶级革命派，在政治上、思想上又大大提高了一步。
    上海高等学校广大革命师生员工表示，在组织上实现了革命的大联合以后，还必须在思想上不断地巩固和提高。只有实现思想上的大联合，组织上的大联合才能经得起大风大浪的考验。我们必须看到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切阶级敌人，最害怕无产阶级革命派的大联合。我们要百倍警惕阶级敌人破坏我们的革命大联合，绝不能让他们的阴谋得逞。许多学校革命师生员工表示要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，深入开展革命的大批判，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把中国赫鲁晓夫批深批透，批倒批臭，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，进一步搞好复课闹革命，就地闹革命，节约闹革命，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
