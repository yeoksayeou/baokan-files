Under the guidance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, the two revolutionary mass organizations of Beijing Department Store have achieved revolutionary great unity, establishing the "Beijing Department Store Revolutionary Staff Great United Committee." This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! We enthusiastically cheer: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have illuminated the hearts of all revolutionary staff, expressing the thoughts of all revolutionary staff. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has made us deeply realize that only by uniting and joining forces can various revolutionary organizations defeat our common enemy and accomplish the historical tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation assigned by Chairman Mao. Without achieving revolutionary great unity, with each faction on its own, constantly waging "internal wars" and arguing endlessly, it will only cause pain to our friends and joy to our enemies.

Today, the two major factions of Beijing Department Store have achieved revolutionary great unity, adding new splendor to the capital's celebration of National Day!

The two major factions of Beijing Department Store have united! We must continue to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the soul to consolidate our revolutionary great unity. Our current task is to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate our firepower and targets, fiercely struggle and criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit, achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and in the high tide of revolutionary criticism, promote revolution and production, create new achievements for the revolution, and build new labor.

　　团结起来搞好斗批改
　　北京市百货大楼革命职工大联合委员会
    在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示下，北京市百货大楼两大派革命群众组织实现了革命的大联合，成立了“百货大楼革命职工大联合委员会”。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们热烈欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席的最新指示，照亮了我们全体革命职工的心，说出了我们全体革命职工的心里话。一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我们深深地体会到，各个革命组织只有联合起来，团结起来，才能战胜我们共同的敌人，才能完成毛主席交给我们的一斗二批三改的历史任务；不实行革命的大联合，你一个山头，我一个山头，整天打“内战”，争吵不休，只能使亲者痛，仇者快。
    今天，我们百货大楼两大派群众组织实现了革命大联合，为首都人民欢度国庆增添了新的光彩！
    我们百货大楼两大派组织联合起来了！我们还要继续努力活学活用毛主席著作，克服小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为我们巩固革命大联合的灵魂，以思想革命化来巩固组织上的联合。当前，摆在我们面前的任务，就是牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，集中火力，集中目标，猛斗狠批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，搞好本单位的斗批改，实现革命的“三结合”，并在革命的大批判的高潮中，抓革命，促生产，为革命立新功，建新劳。
