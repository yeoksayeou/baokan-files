The Lao People's Patriotic Front strongly supports the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and resolutely stands shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors.

The Albanian newspaper "Luftetari" praises the political program of South Vietnam and supports the Vietnamese people to fight to the end.

	KANPAI, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the Central Committee of the Lao People's Patriotic Front issued a statement on September 7, strongly supporting the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	The statement said that the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam reflects the spirit of the South Vietnamese people's resolute struggle for the freedom and liberation of their homeland. It meets the interests and aspirations of the Vietnamese people. This program is an important document that points out the path to victory for the heroic South Vietnamese people.

	The statement said that the close comrades-in-arms of the South Vietnamese people, the Lao patriotic soldiers and people who stand on the front line of the anti-American struggle together with the South Vietnamese people, are ready to make any sacrifice and are determined to defeat the U.S. imperialists' "special war" to support the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to support their struggle for an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and ultimately for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

	The Pathet Lao radio station also issued a commentary on September 8, saying, "The political program adopted by the extraordinary conference of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam marks a new development in the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. It fully reflects the South Vietnamese people's various classes' aspirations and determination to defeat the American aggressors, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

	The commentary said that the Lao people enthusiastically support the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with their Vietnamese brothers and sisters at all times, determined to overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and fight against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

	TIRANA, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) - The Albanian newspaper "Luftetari" recently published a commentary saying that the political program recently adopted by the extraordinary conference of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a new pledge by the National Liberation Front and all the people of South Vietnam to resolutely carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its Saigon puppets to the end.

	The commentary said that this historic document highly praises the power of the people's war, once again emphasizing that only through armed struggle can the homeland be liberated, and firmly refuting the imperialists' and revisionists' "peace talks" tricks.

	The commentary said that U.S. imperialism is exerting pressure and engaging in various conspiracies. They are trying to convene an "international conference" to discuss the Vietnamese issue through the United Nations, which is manipulated by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique, in an attempt to maintain U.S. imperialist rule in South Vietnam.

	The commentary said that the conspiracy planned by the Johnson administration, with the support of the Soviet revisionists, will deceive no one. As for the U.S. imperialists' escalation of the war in South Vietnam and the "escalation" of bombing in North Vietnam, they will inevitably suffer even more severe defeats.

    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会九月七日发表声明，热烈支持越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领，体现了越南南方人民为争取祖国的自由和解放而坚决斗争的精神，它符合越南人民的利益和愿望。这个纲领是给英勇的越南南方人民指出了胜利道路的重要文件。
    声明说，越南南方人民的亲密战友、同越南南方人民一起站在反美斗争最前线的老挝爱国军民，不惜作出任何牺牲，决心打败美帝国主义的“特种战争”，以支持越南南方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，支持他们争取建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一越南的斗争。
    巴特寮电台在九月八日也发表评论说，“越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议通过的政治纲领，标志着越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争的新发展，充分地体现了越南南方各阶层人民战胜美国强盗，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国的目的和愿望。”
    评论说，老挝人民热烈支持越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领，并且愿同兄弟的越南南方人民时刻并肩战斗，决心克服一切困难，不怕任何牺牲，抗击共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》最近发表评论说，越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议不久前通过的政治纲领，是民族解放阵线和全体越南南方人民把反对美帝国主义者及其西贡仆从的斗争坚决进行到底的新的誓言。
    评论说，这一历史文件高度赞扬人民战争的威力，再次强调指出，只有通过武装斗争才能解放祖国，坚决驳斥了帝国主义、修正主义者的“和谈”的阴谋诡计。
    评论说，美帝国主义正在施加压力，进行各种阴谋活动，他们正在竭力想通过被美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团操纵的联大，召开讨论越南问题的“国际会议”，妄图维持美帝国主义在越南南方的统治。
    评论说，约翰逊政府策划的、并得到苏修支持的这一阴谋也骗不了任何人。至于美帝国主义在越南南方的战争升级和在越南北方的轰炸“升级”，也不可避免地将遭到更加惨重的失败。
