In the radiant light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the great revolutionary alliance in Nanchang is surging forward, with triumphant songs echoing everywhere. In just a few days, over a hundred units across the city have achieved great revolutionary unity.

Upon receiving Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," revolutionary comrades in Nanchang immediately began studying it earnestly and implementing it resolutely. A high tide of great revolutionary unity swept through the city. From factories and enterprises to government offices and schools, joyous celebrations of revolutionary unity could be seen everywhere. Revolutionary comrades expressed their boundless excitement, saying: Chairman Mao's latest instruction is like a brilliant red lamp, illuminating our path forward. We resolutely unite for the revolution, and unite to carry out the revolution!

In the previous period, the working class in Nanchang had already achieved relatively good results in revolutionary unity, with over 65% of factories and enterprises realizing great revolutionary unity. In this new wave of revolutionary unity, the working class, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took the lead once again. They said: With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can prioritize proletarian party spirit, free ourselves from petty-bourgeois factionalism, and become promoters of great revolutionary unity. The Jiangxi Metal Factory originally had three revolutionary mass organizations. Due to erroneous thoughts such as "demanding conditions" and "competing for positions," they had held three negotiations but failed to unite. This time, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to seize control of the "self" in their minds, criticizing sectarianism and localism, and quickly achieved great revolutionary unity. They deeply felt that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental guarantee for achieving great revolutionary unity.

Jiangxi University had two revolutionary mass organizations that had been in conflict for a long time. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, members of both organizations actively engaged in self-criticism, striving to be promoters of great unity, and quickly united within a day. The provincial and municipal cultural circles, with over forty units and nearly seventy revolutionary mass organizations, had not united in the past. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the leaders of various organizations held a meeting on great unity. During the meeting, everyone conducted self-criticism, looked forward, saw the main aspects of the other side, and exchanged hearts. As a result, an agreement was reached at the meeting, achieving great revolutionary unity in the cultural circles.

On the evening of the 22nd, the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the province and municipality held a swearing-in ceremony for achieving great revolutionary unity. Leaders from the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Jiangxi Military Region attended the meeting and spoke. They called on the revolutionary masses of the province and municipality to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and be models and achieve new victories in the great criticism and great unity.

　　团结起来，共同对敌
　　南昌革命大联合凯歌阵阵
　　几天之内，全市一百多个单位的革命派实现了大联合
    据新华社南昌二十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，南昌市革命大联合的洪流奔腾，凯歌阵阵。几天之间，全市有一百多个单位实现了革命的大联合。
    毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示一传到南昌，广大革命派就认真学习，坚决照办，迅速地掀起了革命大联合的高潮。从工厂、企业到机关、学校，到处都有欢庆革命大联合的人群。广大革命派无比激动地说：毛主席的最新指示，象一盏光芒万丈的红灯，照亮了我们前进的道路。我们坚决为革命而联合，联合起来干革命！
    南昌市工人阶级在前一个时期革命大联合就搞得比较好，百分之六十五以上的厂矿企业实现了革命的大联合。在这次革命大联合的高潮中，工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，又一马当先。他们说：头脑里有了毛泽东思想，就能把无产阶级党性摆在首位，从小资产阶级的派性中解放出来，成为革命大联合的促进派。江西五金厂原来有三个革命群众组织，前一时期由于“讲条件”、“争席位”等错误思想作怪，协商了三次都没有联合起来。这一次，他们学习了毛主席的最新指示和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，夺头脑里“私”字的权，批判了小团体主义、山头主义，迅速实现了革命大联合。他们深有体会地说：活学活用毛主席著作，大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威，是实现革命大联合的根本保证。
    江西大学有两个革命群众组织，长期闹对立。在学习了毛主席的最新指示后，两个组织的同志都主动作自我批评，争做大联合的促进派，在一天中，很快就联合起来了。省、市文艺界有四十多个单位、近七十个革命群众组织，过去一直没有联合起来。在毛主席最新指示的指引下，各组织负责人举行了大联合的座谈会。在会上，各人进行了自我批评，都向前看，看对方的主流，相互交心。结果，就在座谈会上达成了协议，实现了文艺界的革命大联合。
    二十二日晚上，省、市各革命群众组织负责人举行了实现革命大联合的誓师大会。江西省革命委员会筹备小组和江西省军区负责人出席了大会，并且讲了话。他们号召省市无产阶级革命派更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，在革命大批判、大联合中当模范，立新功。
