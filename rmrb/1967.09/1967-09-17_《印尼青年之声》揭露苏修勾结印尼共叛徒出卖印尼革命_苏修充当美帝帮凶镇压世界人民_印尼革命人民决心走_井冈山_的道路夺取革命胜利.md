The Voice of Indonesian Youth recently published an article exposing how the Soviet revisionist leadership colluded with the notorious Indonesian Communist traitor Suma Temin to curry favor with the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, thereby further betraying the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people.

The article states that Suma Temin, who serves as the chairman of the Yellow Union—the Indonesian Republic Central Labor Federation—has been invited by the Soviet Union's trade unions to visit Moscow.

The article notes that the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime is now promoting Suma Temin as a labor leader to travel abroad as its showcase. Suma Temin is indeed the perfect fit for the Suharto-Nasution bandits.

The article explains that around 1920, Suma Temin infiltrated the Indonesian Communist Party. However, in 1923, he surrendered to the Dutch colonial government and was allowed to leave Indonesia. Abroad, he conspired with the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie figure Hatta and later went to Moscow. In the lead-up to the 1955 Indonesian general election, he returned to Indonesia and ran as a candidate for the Masyumi Party. As soon as the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime was established, Suma Temin issued a statement praising and currying favor with this regime, which has sucked the blood of tens of thousands of Indonesian Communists and patriots. Therefore, the most fitting title for Suma Temin is "old traitor."

The article states: "This old traitor is a tame tool of Indonesian fascists and Soviet revisionists. Suma Temin is a good channel for Soviet revisionists to spread revisionist ideas among the Indonesian people, disrupting and splitting the Indonesian revolutionary ranks. Soviet revisionists intend to use Suma Temin to rally as many Indonesian traitors as possible to extinguish the flames of armed struggle among the Indonesian people."

The article further states that Suma Temin is also carrying letters from the fascist leader Suharto to Moscow. Suharto will seek further assistance from the Soviet authorities to save the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, which is facing severe economic difficulties and growing popular resistance.

The article states that Soviet revisionists always spare no effort to act as loyal henchmen and tame slaves of American imperialism. In the early days of the white terror that raged after September 30, 1965, Soviet official newspapers referred to Nasution as a "patriot" and "revolutionary." This means that Soviet revisionists agree with the massacre of the Indonesian people carried out by the Suharto-Nasution bandits.

The article states: "Due to internal and external difficulties, the Indonesian fascist military regime is intensifying the sale of the people's interests to exchange for the support and assistance of its two 'saviors,' American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. One of the actions taken by the fascist regime in this regard is to open the doors wide for foreign capital to flood into Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist clique, unwilling to lag behind American imperialism, is also investing in Indonesia, jointly plundering and exploiting."

The article emphasizes: "The Soviet revisionist clique attempts to deceive the people of the world with its revisionist 'theory,' claiming that they support the national liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples of various countries. However, now the revolutionary people of the world have already clearly seen that the Soviet revisionist clique is a henchman of American imperialism in suppressing the people of the world."

The article concludes by stating that all revolutionary youth in Indonesia will remain highly vigilant, continue to expose Suma Temin's treacherous activities during this visit, firmly stand on the side of Indonesian Marxist-Leninists who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely take the "Jinggangshan" road to achieve victory in the Indonesian revolution.

    《印尼青年之声》揭露苏修勾结印尼共叛徒出卖印尼革命
    苏修充当美帝帮凶镇压世界人民
    印尼革命人民决心走“井冈山”的道路夺取革命胜利
    据新华社十六日讯　《印尼青年之声》最近发表文章，揭露苏联修正主义领导集团勾结臭名远扬的印尼共老牌叛徒司马温，讨好苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，以便进一步出卖印尼人民的革命事业。
    文章说，担任黄色工会——印尼共和国中央职工会总主席的司马温，应苏联工会的邀请，将去莫斯科活动。
    文章说，现在，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权把司马温抬出来，以工会领袖人物身份出国，作为它的展览品。司马温确实是最合苏哈托—纳苏蒂安匪徒胃口的人。
    文章说，司马温约在一九二○年左右混入印尼共产党，但是，在一九二三年，他就投降荷兰殖民政府，被批准离开印尼。在国外，他同印尼反动资产阶级人物哈达勾结在一起，后来到了莫斯科。一九五五年印尼普选前夕，他回到印尼。当时他当了平民党的候选人。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权一成立，司马温就发表声明，赞扬和讨好这个吮吸了几十万印尼共产党人和爱国者鲜血的政权，表示要效忠于它。因此，给司马温最合适的名字是老牌叛徒。
    文章说：“这个老牌叛徒是印尼法西斯分子和苏联修正主义者的驯服工具。司马温是苏联修正主义者在印尼人民中间散布修正主义思想，扰乱和分裂印尼革命队伍的好渠道。苏联修正主义者妄图利用司马温纠集尽可能多的印尼叛徒，来扑灭印尼人民的武装斗争烽火。”
    文章说，司马温还带着法西斯将领苏哈托的信件去莫斯科。苏哈托将向苏联当局讨取进一步的援助，来挽救经济上重重困难和日益增长的人民反抗的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的地位。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者总是竭尽全力充当美帝国主义者的忠实帮凶和驯服奴才。在一九六五年九月三十日以后白色恐怖猖狂的最初日子里，苏联官方报纸就称纳苏蒂安为“爱国者”和“革命者”。这就是说，苏联修正主义者同意苏哈托—纳苏蒂安匪徒对印尼人民所进行的大屠杀。
    文章说：“由于内外交困，印尼法西斯军人政权正在加紧出卖人民的利益，来换取它的两个‘救世主’美帝国主义和苏联修正主义统治集团的援助和支持。法西斯政权在这方面所采取的一个行动是，为外国资本涌入印尼大开方便之门。苏联修正主义集团不甘落后于美帝国主义，也在印尼投资，共同进行掠夺和剥削。”
    文章强调说：“苏联修正主义集团企图以它的修正主义‘理论’，蒙骗世界人民，说他们是支持各国被压迫人民的民族解放斗争的。但是现在，世界革命人民都已经清楚地知道，苏联修正主义集团是美帝国主义镇压世界人民的帮凶。”
    文章最后表示，印尼全体革命青年将以高度的警惕性，继续揭露司马温这次出访的叛卖活动，坚定地站在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的印尼马克思列宁主义者一边，决心走“井冈山”的道路，夺取印尼革命的胜利。
