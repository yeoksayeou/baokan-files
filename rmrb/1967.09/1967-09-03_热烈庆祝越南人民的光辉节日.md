Comrade Vu Minh Quan, the Ambassador, said: The Vietnamese people have demonstrated the power of people's war in the anti-American national salvation struggle, fighting stronger and winning more with each battle.

Comrade Li Xiannian, the Vice Premier, said: The Chinese people will fully support the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle until final victory.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, September 2 — Tonight, Vu Minh Quan, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, hosted a reception to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	Central leaders and other responsible comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Guo Moruo, and Yang Chengwu attended the reception at the invitation.

	At the reception, filled with the atmosphere of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Vietnam, Ambassador Vu Minh Quan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian both spoke. Ambassador Vu Minh Quan emphasized that in the anti-American national salvation struggle, the Vietnamese people have demonstrated the power of people's war, fighting stronger and winning more with each battle. The Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end for their sacred national rights.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that the Chinese people firmly follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, always regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle as our internationalist duty. We are closely watching the developments in Vietnam, ready to take all necessary actions in the highest interests of the peoples of China and Vietnam and the world revolutionary people, fully supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle until final victory.

	The delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by team leader Nguyen Van Huy and deputy team leader Ho Kwei, and the deputy head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's permanent representative office in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, as well as Vietnamese comrades in Beijing, attended the reception.

	Ambassador Vu Minh Quan said that the 22-year history of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a history of a nation that prefers to sacrifice everything rather than be enslaved, fighting tirelessly. Currently, under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Vietnamese people have demonstrated the power of people's war, achieving brilliant victories and delivering fatal blows to the American aggressors. The Vietnamese people are fighting stronger and winning more with each battle.

	Ambassador Vu Minh Quan strongly condemned the American imperialists' "peace talks" deception, attempting to deceive the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. He said, the Vietnamese people cannot be deceived. No matter how great the sacrifices and hardships, the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end for their sacred national rights.

	Ambassador Vu Minh Quan said that the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people have a long history of fighting friendship, and this friendship has become even closer in the struggle against the common enemy of American imperialist aggression. On behalf of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people, he expressed heartfelt and sincere thanks to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the 700 million Chinese people for their great support and assistance to Vietnam.

	Ambassador Vu Minh Quan said that the Vietnamese people highly value the position and role of the Chinese revolution in the world revolution, believing that China's increasingly great achievements greatly inspire the struggles of all oppressed nations against imperialism led by American imperialism. The Vietnamese people sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said in his speech that the 22 years since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been 22 years of high anti-imperialist revolutionary war, 22 years of moving from victory to victory. The Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is a true people's war. The great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war have become a source of inspiration and a shining example for the peoples of all countries engaged in revolutionary struggle.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian strongly condemned the Johnson administration's escalation of the war in Vietnam while intensifying political deception. He pointed out that no matter how the American imperialists escalate the war or play "peace talks" tricks, the Vietnamese people, tempered by long experience, are not to be intimidated or deceived. The four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are unshakable. The Vietnamese people's desire to defend the north, liberate the south, and unify the country will certainly be realized.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression has received the full support of all true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples. However, the modern revisionists have gone even further in serving the American imperialists' counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. They engage in secret talks, provide intelligence, offer black schemes, and make secret agreements, attempting to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle. The modern revisionists once colluded with the Americans to sabotage the anti-aggression struggle of the Arab people, and recently, they have joined forces with the Americans to propose a so-called "non-proliferation treaty" draft, aiming to deprive peace-loving countries of the right to develop self-defense nuclear weapons. Undeniable facts prove that the modern revisionist leadership has become the number one accomplice of the American imperialists in executing their counter-revolutionary global strategy, and their traitorous faces are more exposed than ever.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the current world revolutionary situation is very good. Especially in the Southeast Asian region adjacent to China and Vietnam, the flames of people's armed struggle are burning more fiercely. The Lao People's Liberation Army is persisting in a long-term struggle, directly striking at the American imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression in Indochina. The armed struggle of the Thai people is spreading nationwide like wildfire. The Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, is firmly adhering to the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power," becoming the core force uniting various ethnic peoples to overthrow the Nay Win reactionary government. The armed struggle of the Indian people is on the rise. Indonesian revolutionaries have broken through the white terror of the fascist military regime and are regrouping forces to launch armed struggles based in the countryside. All of this indicates that the revolutionary movement in Asia is entering a new stage, and a greater revolutionary storm is about to come. The rapid development of armed struggles in Asia is a powerful support and assistance to the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian, speaking of the current great revolutionary situation in our country, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has already achieved great victories. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed; the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of the proletarian dictatorship have been smashed; the reactionary line that prepared political conditions for capitalist restoration has been defeated. Our people are advancing with confidence along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	Vice Premier Li Xiannian praised the friendly, united, and mutually supportive relationship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Vietnam. He said that imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are most afraid of our two countries' rock-solid unity and cooperation. They stir up trouble, spread rumors, and maliciously slander in an attempt to sabotage. Their conspiracies will not succeed now and will never succeed in the future.

	Envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

	To celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Du Van Minh, the Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, and Yang Wen Zhong, the Consul General in Kunming, held receptions and banquets on September 1 and 2, respectively.

    新华社二日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十二周年。
    中央领导同志和其他方面负责同志周恩来、康生、李先念、谢富治、郭沫若、杨成武等，应邀出席了招待会。
    在洋溢着中越两国人民团结战斗友谊气氛的招待会上，吴明鸾大使和李先念副总理先后讲了话。吴明鸾大使强调说，越南人民在抗美救国战争中发挥了人民战争的威力，越打越强，越打越胜。越南人民坚决为争取自己神圣的民族权利战斗到底。
    李先念副总理强调说，中国人民坚决遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己应尽的国际主义义务。我们正密切注视越南局势的发展，随时准备采取符合中、越两国人民和世界革命人民最高利益的一切必要行动，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    由团长阮文煊、副团长何桂率领的越中友协代表团全体成员，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳，以及在北京的越南同志参加了招待会。
    吴明鸾大使说，越南民主共和国二十二年来的历史，是一个宁肯牺牲一切而坚决不作奴隶的民族进行艰苦不懈的斗争的历史。目前，越南人民在越南劳动党的英明领导下，发挥了人民战争的威力，取得了辉煌的胜利，给了美国侵略者致命的打击。越南人民越打越强，越打越胜。
    吴明鸾大使强烈谴责美帝国主义玩弄“和谈”阴谋，企图蒙骗越南人民和全世界人民。他说，越南人民是骗不了的。越南人民不管要承担多大的牺牲，要经受多大的艰苦，坚决为争取自己神圣的民族权利而战斗到底。
    吴明鸾大使说，越南人民和中国人民有着悠久的战斗友谊，目前在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略的斗争中更加密切。他代表越南劳动党、越南政府和越南人民向毛主席、中国共产党、中国政府和七亿中国人民给予越南的巨大支持和援助，表示衷心的诚挚的感谢。
    吴明鸾大使说，越南人民高度评价中国革命对世界革命的地位和作用，认为中国所取得日益巨大的成就，大大地鼓舞了正在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的各被压迫民族的斗争。越南人民衷心地祝贺中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中获得巨大的胜利。
    李先念副总理在讲话中说，越南民主共和国成立以来的二十二年，是高举反帝革命战争大旗的二十二年，是从胜利走向胜利的二十二年。越南人民的抗美救国战争，是真正的人民战争。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，成为正在进行革命斗争的各国人民的鼓舞力量和光辉榜样。
    李先念副总理强烈谴责约翰逊政府在越南大搞战争升级，同时又加紧进行政治欺骗。他指出，不论美帝国主义进行什么样的战争“升级”，玩弄什么样的“和谈”阴谋，久经考验百炼成钢的越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的。越南民主共和国的四点主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明是不可动摇的。越南人民保卫北方、解放南方，统一祖国的民族愿望是一定要实现的。
    李先念副总理说，越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，得到一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和一切革命人民的全力支持。而现代修正主义者却变本加厉地为美帝国主义的反革命两手效劳，他们搞密谈，送情报，献黑计，订默契，力图扑灭越南人民抗美救国的斗争。现代修正主义者曾勾结美帝破坏阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争，最近，它们又伙同美帝抛出一个所谓“防止核扩散条约”草案，阴谋剥夺爱好和平的国家发展自卫核武器的权利。无可争辩的事实证明，现代修正主义者领导集团已变成美帝执行反革命全球战略的头号帮凶，它的叛徒面目，更加暴露无遗。
    李先念副总理说，当前世界革命形势好得很。特别是在同中、越两国邻近的东南亚地区，人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺。老挝人民解放军坚持长期抗战，直接打击了美帝国主义扩大侵略印度支那战争的阴谋。泰国人民的武装斗争，正以燎原之势向全国发展。以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的革命路线，成为团结各族人民、打倒奈温反动政府的核心力量。印度人民的武装斗争正在兴起。印尼革命者冲破了法西斯军人政权的白色恐怖，正在重新集结力量，开展以农村为根据地的武装斗争。所有这一切都表明，亚洲的革命运动正走向一个新阶段，更大的革命风暴即将来临。亚洲人民武装斗争的迅猛发展，对越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是有力的配合和支援。
    李先念副总理谈到当前我国的一片大好革命形势时说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的胜利。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已经被揪出来了；隐藏在无产阶级专政机构中的资产阶级司令部，已经被摧毁了；为资本主义复辟准备政治条件的资产阶级反动路线，已经被打垮了。我国人民正沿着毛主席指引的方向，满怀信心地胜利前进，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    李先念副总理称颂中越两党、两国人民之间友好团结、互助合作的关系。他说，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，最害怕我们两国磐石般的团结合作，它们挑拨离间，造谣中伤，妄图进行破坏。它们这种阴谋现在不能得逞，将来也决不能得逞。
    各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
    为庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十二周年，越南民主共和国驻广州总领事杜文敏和驻昆明总领事杨文忠，也分别在一日和二日举行了招待会和宴会。
