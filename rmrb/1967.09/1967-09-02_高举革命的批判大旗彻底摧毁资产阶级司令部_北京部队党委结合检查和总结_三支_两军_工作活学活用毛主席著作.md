The Beijing Military Region Party Committee, while reviewing and summarizing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. After analyzing the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution and the progress of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, they emphasized: The main enemy in revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party; the main contradiction to be resolved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party; the main means to resolve this main contradiction is to use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, not only to seize their power and remove their positions, but more importantly, to politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose them, thoroughly eliminating all their poisonous influences.

The comrades at the meeting unanimously agreed: We, the People's Liberation Army, must firmly and actively support the revolutionary masses, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and launch a great exposure, criticism, and struggle "people's war" against the main enemy—China's Khrushchev and his gang, completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters. This is the more important, more prominent, and more arduous task for the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work at present.

Grasp the Main Contradiction, Strike the Most Dangerous Enemy

Comrades discussed: In the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, various contradictions are intertwined and complex. For example, the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, the contradiction among revolutionary mass organizations, the contradiction between revolutionary mass organizations and conservative organizations, the contradiction between revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and the contradiction between the supporting-left troops and the masses, etc. Among these many contradictions, we must firmly grasp the main contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. This is an antagonistic contradiction between us and the enemy. The struggle between the proletariat and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party is the concentrated expression of the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, have secretly established a bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev within the proletarian dictatorship organs. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we must firmly direct our spearhead at this handful, concentrate our forces to smash this bourgeois headquarters, to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that the proletariat's mountain will never change color.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must use all our strength to find its main contradiction. Once we grasp the main contradiction, everything else will be resolved." The practice of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" once again proves the extraordinary wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis. At the meeting, everyone analyzed the current situation of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work in the troops. One situation is that the supporting-left troops firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, continuously guiding the revolutionary masses to focus on the main contradiction and concentrate their efforts to strike the main enemy. Another situation is that although they can grasp the general direction, their actions are often disturbed by some secondary contradictions, sometimes deviating from the direction of the struggle and getting bogged down in trivial issues. There is also a situation where some supporting-left troops, during the supporting-left process, once stood on the wrong side, suppressed the revolutionary faction, causing the movement to fluctuate.

How to grasp the main contradiction? Everyone unanimously pointed out: First, we must have a firm proletarian stance, resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and continuously improve our awareness of focusing on the main contradiction. We must use the method of class analysis, go deep among the masses, conduct extensive and meticulous investigation and research, and humbly understand the situation. In supporting-left work, once mistakes are made, we must immediately and thoroughly check and correct them according to Chairman Mao's teaching: "For the people's interests, persist in what is correct; for the people's interests, correct what is wrong." This is an important indicator of whether we can resolutely execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Completely Smash the Bourgeois Headquarters Politically, Ideologically, and Theoretically

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how to completely defeat the most dangerous enemy and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat? Everyone unanimously agreed that we must fully mobilize the broad masses, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating fallen enemies, launch the broadest, deepest, and most thorough revolutionary criticism movement, politically, ideologically, and theoretically completely defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, completely smash the bourgeois headquarters, and accomplish the main task of the Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is different from the revolution of the ownership system. This is the broadest and deepest revolution that touches people's souls. In the past seventeen years of liberation, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our country has achieved a series of great victories in the economic, political, and ideological fronts. The exploiting class has been overthrown, and we have confiscated their means of production, but we cannot confiscate their reactionary thoughts. They are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they are always dreaming of a comeback. To achieve a comeback, landlords and capitalists cannot take the lead, only through their agents who have infiltrated the Party—China's Khrushchev and the handful of ambitious and conspiratorial figures under his protection, using the positions and power organs they have usurped, they spread capitalist and revisionist poisons, support the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, ghosts, and snakes in society, implement the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and in the ideological realm, use old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits to conquer people's hearts, attempting to achieve the goal of capitalist restoration. Although they occupy a very small proportion of the population, their reactionary energy in politics is very great. The new situation and characteristics of class struggle determine that this revolution is more profound and arduous than the revolution on the economic front.

The comrades at the meeting believed that after a year of the broad revolutionary masses' magnificent exposure, criticism, and struggle, the Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have been exposed in broad daylight, their power has been seized, their positions have been removed, and their organizational means to issue counter-revolutionary orders have been stripped away. However, they are not willing to accept defeat. At the same time, these counter-revolutionary revisionists, although their organizational power has been seized, still have political and ideological command. The capitalist and revisionist poisons they have spread for decades, especially in the more than ten years since liberation, have not been thoroughly eliminated. If we only seize the power from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in power and do not politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the bourgeoisie and revisionist thoughts, not only will the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and a half not be consolidated, but even the revolutionary achievements won through decades of blood and sacrifice may be destroyed in an instant. Only by politically, ideologically, and theoretically completely defeating the enemy can we consolidate the revolutionary achievements and achieve a thorough victory.

The comrades at the meeting unanimously pointed out that grasping the revolutionary criticism is not only the main form of resolving the main contradiction but also the key to resolving other contradictions. Grasping the revolutionary criticism will make the target of the struggle clear, the target of the strike obvious, the class line clearer, and the revolutionary mass organizations will be able to recognize their common enemy. Under the premise of a unified direction of struggle, they will be ruthless to the enemy and lenient to themselves, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences, uniting to fight the enemy. Grasping the revolutionary criticism will make the deceived masses see clearly, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and clarify right and wrong, quickly raise class consciousness, see the ugly face of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power, turn against them, and consciously settle their heinous crimes, truly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Grasping the revolutionary criticism will make various different political stances, political views, and political attitudes stand out, and a handful of stubborn heads who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line will also be fully exposed, despised by the revolutionary masses. Therefore, in the current "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work with countless tasks, the most important thing is to, on the basis of supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize power, proceed from the actual situation of the local area and unit, grasp the revolutionary criticism, and complete the task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. If this is not done, it will be lost in the mist, go astray, find no center, grasp no focus, and thus find no correct method to resolve various contradictions.

The Invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the Sharpest Weapon for Carrying Out Revolutionary Criticism

How can we, in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, carry out the revolutionary criticism well? The comrades at the meeting unanimously agreed that the most fundamental thing is to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp and use Mao Zedong Thought, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and soul of the revolutionary criticism. Everyone talked about how the handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party are a bunch of conspirators and hypocrites. The counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies they spread are easy to deceive people, and their reactionary ugly faces are not easy to be seen through. However, as long as we use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to observe, analyze, and handle problems, we can stand high and see far, see through the phenomena, and see the essence. No matter how cunning and treacherous the enemy is, no matter if they are wolves in sheep's clothing, poisonous snakes disguised as beauties, or smiling tigers and chameleons, they cannot escape the "golden eyes" of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how "persuasive" the revisionist goods they spread are, they will be exposed, criticized, and thrown into the garbage heap of history.

Using Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline to carry out the revolutionary criticism can cultivate and foster a new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the fundamental measure to resolve the main contradiction under the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent revisionism. Everyone talked about how Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow up in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses." The current nationwide wave of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought is a great classroom for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a great school and crucible for fostering the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, in the revolutionary criticism, will better understand and execute Chairman Mao's line, policy, and theory on carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, improve the ability to distinguish between flowers and weeds, enhance immunity, and make every comrade thoroughly understand what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, what is the bourgeois reactionary line, what is the socialist road, what is the capitalist road, what is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and what is revisionism. The new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought and grown in the revolutionary criticism is not only the main force to launch a general offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in the current stage, completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters, but also, in the long run, the iron wall to prevent revisionism in China. With this new generation, we can ensure that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down from generation to generation, from thousands of years to tens of thousands of years, making Mao Zedong Thought forever the unified action program for the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country to struggle for socialism and communism.

The comrades at the meeting pointed out that in the mass movement of revolutionary criticism, a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is rising extensively and deeply. The cadres and soldiers on the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" front must resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, put actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything, stand at the forefront of the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, dare to insist on the truth, bravely correct mistakes, learn new levels in the great criticism and struggle, use new levels, and raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and create new achievements for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

　　高举革命的批判大旗彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
　　——北京部队党委结合检查和总结“三支”“两军”工作活学活用毛主席著作
    中国人民解放军北京部队党委，结合检查和总结“三支”“两军”工作，活学活用毛主席著作。他们在分析了文化大革命的大好形势和“三支”“两军”工作的进展情况后，强调指出：在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的最主要的敌人，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；无产阶级文化大革命要解决的主要矛盾，是无产阶级同钻进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾；解决这个主要矛盾的主要手段，是运用无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，不仅从组织上夺他们的权，罢他们的官，更重要的是从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他们的一切流毒和影响。
    到会同志一致认为：我们人民解放军，要坚定地、积极地帮助无产阶级革命派，高举革命的批判大旗，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向最主要的敌人——中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，展开一场大揭发、大批判、大斗争的“人民战争”，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，这是当前“三支”“两军”工作更为重要，更为突出，更为艰巨的任务。
    抓住主要矛盾，狠狠打击最危险的敌人
    同志们谈到：在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，各种矛盾错综复杂。例如，无产阶级和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，革命群众组织之间的矛盾，革命群众组织和保守组织之间的矛盾，革命群众和革命干部之间的矛盾，以及支左部队和群众之间的矛盾等等。在这许多矛盾中，我们应该紧紧抓住无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的这一主要矛盾，这是对抗性的敌我矛盾。无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间生死斗争的集中表现。钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物，打着红旗反红旗，在无产阶级专政机构中，隐蔽地设置了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。因此，紧紧地把矛头对准这一小撮，集中力量摧毁这个资产阶级司令部，才能巩固和加强无产阶级专政，保证无产阶级的江山永不变色。
    毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”“三支”“两军”的实践，再次证明了毛主席这一论断的无比英明和正确。会上，大家分析了当前部队“三支”“两军”工作的几种状况。一种是支左部队紧紧掌握斗争大方向，不断引导无产阶级革命派狠抓主要矛盾，集中力量打击了主要敌人；另一种情况是，虽然也能够掌握大方向，但他们的行动常常被一些次要矛盾所干扰，有时离开斗争大方向，在一些枝节问题上纠缠不清；也还有一种情况，个别支左部队在支左过程中，一度站错了队，压制了革命派，使运动出现了反复。
    如何抓住主要矛盾呢？大家一致指出：首先要有坚定的无产阶级立场，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，不断提高狠抓主要矛盾的自觉性；要运用阶级分析的方法，深入群众，进行大量的艰苦细致的调查研究工作，虚心地体察情况。在支左工作中，一旦产生了缺点错误，就一定要按照毛主席“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的教导，迅速、彻底地检查和改正错误。这是检验我们能否坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。
    从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样彻底打倒最危险的敌人，巩固无产阶级专政呢？大家一致认为，必须充分发动广大群众，高高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的精神，开展最广泛、最深刻、最彻底的革命大批判运动，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，完成文化大革命的主要任务。无产阶级文化大革命和所有制的革命有所不同。这是一场最广泛、最深刻的触及人们灵魂的大革命。解放十七年来，在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我国在经济、政治、思想战线上取得了一系列的伟大胜利。剥削阶级被打倒了，我们没收了他们的生产资料，但没收不了他们的反动思想。他们人还在，心不死，随时随地都在梦想复辟。他们要实现复辟，地主、资本家不能挂帅了，只有通过钻进党内的代理人——中国的赫鲁晓夫及其卵翼下的一小撮野心家、阴谋家，利用他们窃据的职务和把持的权力机构，极力散布资本主义、修正主义毒素，扶持社会上的地富反坏右、牛鬼蛇神，推行反革命修正主义路线，在意识形态领域，以旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，征服人心，妄图达到资本主义复辟的目的。他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是，他们在政治上的反动能量很大。阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，决定了这场革命比经济战线上的革命更为深刻、更为艰巨。
    到会同志认为，经过一年来广大革命群众波澜壮阔的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，文化大革命已经取得了巨大的胜利。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，被揪在光天化日之下，夺了他们的权，罢了他们的官，剥夺了他们发反革命之号、施反革命之令的组织手段。但是，他们并不甘心于失败。同时，这些反革命修正主义分子，虽然组织上被夺了权，还有政治上、思想上、理论上的指挥权。他们几十年来，特别是解放十多年来，散布的资本主义、修正主义流毒，还远远没有肃清。如果仅仅把印把子从走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回来，而对资产阶级、修正主义思想不批倒批臭，不仅一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果不能巩固，就连几十年流血牺牲夺来的一切革命成果，也可能毁于一旦。只有从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把敌人打倒，才能巩固革命胜利成果，夺取革命的彻底胜利。
    到会同志一致指出，抓好革命的大批判，不仅是解决主要矛盾的主要形式，而且也是解决其它矛盾的一把钥匙。抓好革命的大批判，斗争的目标就亮得清，打击的“靶子”就显得明，阶级阵线就会更加清楚，革命群众组织之间就能认清共同的敌人，在斗争大方向一致的前提下，对敌狠，对己和，求大同，存小异，团结对敌。抓好革命的大批判，受蒙蔽的群众就能擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，明辨是非，就能迅速提高阶级觉悟，看清一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的狰狞面目，反戈一击，自觉地清算敌人的滔天罪行，真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来。抓好革命的大批判，各种不同的政治立场、政治观点、政治态度就会显示出来，一小撮顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，也可以充分暴露出来，遭到革命群众的唾弃。因此，在当前“三支”“两军”千头万绪的工作中，最重要的就是要在支持无产阶级革命派夺权的基础上，从本地区本单位实际情况出发，抓好革命的大批判，胜利完成斗批改任务。如果不这样做，就会堕入烟海，走入迷途，找不到中心，抓不住重点，也就找不到解决各种矛盾的正确方法。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是开展革命大批判最锐利的武器
    怎样才能在“三支”“两军”中和无产阶级革命派一起搞好革命的大批判呢？到会同志一致认为，最根本的根本，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，掌握和运用毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为革命大批判的指导方针和灵魂。大家谈到，钻进党内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，是一伙阴谋家、伪君子。他们散布的反革命修正主义谬论很容易迷惑人，他们反动的丑恶面目也不容易被人识破。然而，只要我们运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，观察问题，分析问题，处理问题，就能够站得高，看得远，透过现象，看清本质。不管敌人多么狡猾、阴险，不管他们是披着羊皮的恶狼，化成美女的毒蛇，还是笑面虎、变色龙，都逃不脱用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众的“火眼金睛”，不管他们散布的修正主义货色多么“娓娓动听”，都会被革命群众揪出来，批倒批臭，扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    以毛泽东思想为指针搞好革命的大批判，就能培养和造就一代用毛泽东思想武装起来的新人，这是解决无产阶级专政条件下的主要矛盾和防止修正主义的根本措施。大家谈到，毛主席一再教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”当前全国掀起的波澜壮阔的以毛泽东思想为指针的革命大批判，就是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大学校、大熔炉。我们和无产阶级革命派一起，在革命大批判中，会更快更好地领会和执行毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的路线、方针、政策和理论，能提高辨别香花毒草的能力，增强免疫力，能使每一个同志彻底了解什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线，什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路，什么是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义。在革命大批判中成长的用毛泽东思想武装起来的一代新人，不仅是现阶段向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的有生力量，从长远来看，也是在中国防止修正主义的铜墙铁壁。有了这一代新人，就能保证战无不胜的毛泽东思想在我国子子孙孙、千秋万代传下去，使毛泽东思想永远成为全党全军全国人民为社会主义和共产主义而奋斗的统一的行动纲领。
    到会同志指出，在革命大批判的群众运动中，一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，正在广泛深入地兴起。在“三支”“两军”战线上的指战员，一定要坚决响应林副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作放在大于一切、高于一切、重于一切、先于一切的位置，站在活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的最前列，敢于坚持真理，勇于修正错误，在大批判、大斗争中学出新水平，用出新水平，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为无产阶级革命事业，创立新功。　（新华社一日讯）
