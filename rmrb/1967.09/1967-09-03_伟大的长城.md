The great Wall

Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao personally created and led the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. This army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is an unparalleled heroic force and a great wall.

It is a great wall defending against imperialist aggression and safeguarding our national defense security.

It is a great wall consolidating our proletarian dictatorship and safeguarding the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

This great wall was built by Chairman Mao leading hundreds of millions of revolutionary people through long-term revolutionary struggles. It was built with the lives and blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. It is a wall that no powerful enemy can break through or destroy.

Under the personal command of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, this great wall has become even more fortified. Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the Military Commission, he has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively proposing a series of policies and major measures to strengthen the army, vigorously promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts, emphasizing proletarian politics, promoting the Three-Eight Style, practicing the Three Great Democracies, and carrying out the Four Good Campaigns, etc. This has made our army more revolutionary and more combat-ready. This great wall has never been as solid as it is now.

The success of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is first and foremost because of the highest prestige of our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. It is also because we have the People's Liberation Army, this great wall.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has given our army the great strategic tasks of "three supports, two militaries." This is the greatest trust and greatest care for our army. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have also shown their unwavering trust in our army.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul.

Our army is able to become a solid wall and gain the trust of the Party and the masses because it is armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army. Our broad cadres and soldiers love Chairman Mao limitlessly, worship Mao Zedong Thought limitlessly, and are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. In the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and further establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. In this way, our great wall will become even more fortified, even stronger, and play an even greater role.

Chairman Mao also teaches us: "What is the true iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who genuinely support the revolution. This is the true iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries."

Our People's Liberation Army stands firmly with the Chinese people, wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people. We have formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses, a relationship of fish and water. Therefore, we have truly become a great wall that no force can break, gaining the trust of the Party and the masses. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must unwaveringly rely on the revolutionary leftists, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. We rely on the broad masses to help us carry out the "three supports, two militaries" work. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people," launching a larger-scale people-loving movement, further strengthening military-civilian relations, and strengthening military-civilian unity. We must take all responsibilities to resolutely support and cherish all proletarian revolutionaries, resolutely support and cherish all Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and resolutely support and cherish all revolutionary masses. Our words and deeds must be accountable to the people. Whatever benefits the people, we must insist on doing; whatever goes against the people's interests, we must resolutely fight against and resist. If we have any shortcomings or mistakes, we must welcome the people's criticism and correction, and resolutely correct them to serve the people completely and thoroughly. In this way, the broad masses will love and support us even more, trusting and supporting us even more. Our army will have boundless strength and be able to establish new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Loving, strengthening, and fortifying the People's Liberation Army, this great wall, is the common responsibility of the entire military and civilian population. However, domestic and foreign class enemies, driven by their class nature, fear and hate this great wall to the core. They will inevitably try every means to sabotage our army's prestige and stir up trouble between the military and the civilians, attempting to fish in troubled waters. But as long as all cadres and soldiers of our army and all revolutionary masses remain highly vigilant, the enemy's plots will never succeed. In the face of this great wall, all class enemies will be defeated, meeting their inevitable fate of complete failure.

Comrades in the entire army, let us resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, not disappoint Chairman Mao and the people's trust and expectations in us. Let us hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," forever be models of loving the people, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unite closely with the people of the entire nation, fight together, and win new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　伟大的长城
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的，林彪副主席亲自指挥的中国人民解放军，是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的举世无双的英雄的军队，是一个伟大的长城。
    它是防御帝国主义侵略、保卫我国国防安全的伟大的长城。
    它是巩固我国无产阶级专政、保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大的长城。
    这个伟大的长城，是毛主席亲自领导亿万革命人民，在长期革命斗争中构筑起来的，是无数革命先烈用生命和鲜血构筑起来的，是任何强大的敌人也攻不破、摧不毁的。
    这个伟大的长城，在毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自指挥下更加巩固了。林副主席主持军委工作以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造性地提出加强军队建设的一系列方针政策和重大措施，大力开展群众性的活学活用毛主席著作运动，坚持四个第一，突出无产阶级政治，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等等，使我军更加无产阶级革命化，更加战斗化了。这个伟大的长城，从来没有象现在这样坚固。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命能够顺利地进行，首先是因为有伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的最崇高的威望，同时也因为有人民解放军这样一个伟大的长城。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席交给我军“三支”“两军”的伟大的战略任务，这是对我军的最大的信任，最大的关怀。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在这场大革命中，也表现了对我军的无比信赖。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。
    我军之所以能够成为坚固的长城，能够得到党和人民群众的信任，是因为有着伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的武装。毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂。我军广大指战员无限热爱毛主席，无限崇拜毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，进一步树立起毛主席的绝对权威，毛泽东思想的绝对权威，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，毛主席的无产阶级司令部的绝对权威。这样，我们伟大的长城就越来越巩固，越来越坚强，发挥越来越大的作用。
    毛主席还教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    我们人民解放军是紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务的人民的子弟兵，同人民群众结成了血肉相联的关系，鱼水相依的关系，所以我们真正成为任何力量也打不破的伟大长城，得到党和人民群众的信任。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要坚定不移地依靠革命左派，要相信和依靠广大革命群众，相信和依靠干部的大多数。依靠广大群众协助我们搞好“三支”“两军”的工作。要坚决响应毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，更大规模地展开一个热烈的爱民运动，进一步密切军民关系，加强军民团结。我们要尽一切责任，坚决支持和爱护一切无产阶级革命派，坚决支持和爱护一切红卫兵革命小将，坚决支持和爱护一切革命群众。我们的一言一行，都要向人民负责。凡是符合人民利益的，我们就要坚持去做；凡是违背人民利益的，我们就要坚决斗争，坚决抵制。我们如果有缺点错误，就要欢迎人民群众批评指出，坚决改正，做到完全、彻底为人民服务。这样，广大人民群众就会更加热爱和拥护我们，更加信任和支持我们。我们这支军队就会有无穷无尽的力量，就能在无产阶级文化大革命运动中建立新的功勋。
    爱护、加强和巩固人民解放军这个伟大的长城，是全国军民的共同责任。而国内外的阶级敌人，从他们的阶级本性出发，对人民解放军这个伟大的长城，怕得要死，恨之入骨。他们必然要处心积虑地妄图破坏我们军队的威信，挑拨军民之间的关系，妄图混水摸鱼。但是，只要我军的全体指战员和一切革命群众，保持高度的警惕，敌人的阴谋是绝对不可能得逞的。在伟大的长城面前，一切阶级敌人都会碰得头破血流，避免不了他们彻底失败的命运。
    全军同志们，让我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，决不辜负毛主席和人民群众对我们的信赖和期望，高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，永远做爱民的模范，在毛主席革命路线的指导下，同全国人民紧密地团结起来，共同战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
