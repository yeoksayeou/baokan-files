Over the past year, the soldiers of the Xinjiang Red Second Headquarters have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Under the care of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, and with the support and assistance of revolutionary comrades from the proletariat in the capital and across the country, we have resolutely fought against the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Xinjiang, achieving one victory after another.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionaries in Xinjiang, with the support of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, are gradually forming a new situation of revolutionary great unity. In this favorable situation, the revolutionary comrades from the Xinjiang Red Second Headquarters and other revolutionary factions who came to Beijing will immediately return to their respective regions and units to make revolution. We are determined, together with our comrades back home, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and swear to criticize and expose the biggest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Xinjiang. We will strive to seize the initiative in both revolution and production, achieving double victories in revolution and production. We will be model supporters of the military, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, heightening our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and preventing sabotage activities by domestic and foreign class enemies to defend the borders of our motherland and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We also hope that proletarian revolutionary comrades from other regions in Beijing will resolutely respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Party, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and return to their respective regions as soon as possible to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    一年来，我们新疆红二司的战士，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席和党中央的关怀下，在首都和全国无产阶级革命派战友的支持和帮助下，同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在新疆的代理人进行了坚决的斗争，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    目前，我们新疆无产阶级革命派，正在伟大的中国人民解放军支持下，逐步形成革命的大联合的新局面。在这样大好形势下，我们新疆红二司等革命派来京人员，坚决响应党中央号召，立即回到本地区、本单位闹革命。我们决心和家里战友一道，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起一个革命大批判的新高潮，誓把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在新疆的代理人批倒、批臭。我们要努力抓革命促生产，夺取革命生产双胜利。我们要做拥军的模范，和伟大的中国人民解放军在一起并肩战斗，百倍提高革命警惕性，严防国内外阶级敌人的破坏活动，保卫祖国边疆，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    我们也希望在京的其他地区的无产阶级革命派战友，坚决响应党中央号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，尽快返回本地区，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
