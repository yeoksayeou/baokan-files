While Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, in defiance of the strong opposition from the peoples of China and Japan, was in Taiwan colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the Japanese reactionary government on the 8th and 9th manufactured incidents, dispatching a large number of police, secret agents, and thugs to attack our country's Liaozhengzhi Office personnel, Chinese journalists, and staff in Japan, committing another extremely serious anti-China fascist atrocity.

On the afternoon of the 8th, the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo held a press conference to protest Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan. A "journalist" from the most reactionary Jiji Press, who was not invited, insisted on entering the venue and was immediately rejected by the Chinese personnel in Japan.

At 7 PM that evening, two more self-proclaimed "journalists" from Jiji Press came to the Liaozhengzhi Office's residence to pick a fight. They arrogantly shouted, "Why wasn't Jiji Press invited to the press conference?" and demanded to see the responsible person at the Liaozhengzhi Office, threatening to "investigate the reason." Chinese staff members firmly rejected this unreasonable provocation. These two individuals also shouted, "We want to take photos of the Liaozhengzhi Office's residence," and Chinese staff members repeatedly warned them, "You are not allowed to take photos without our permission." Ignoring the warnings from Chinese staff members, they not only took photos of the office building but also took photos of the Chinese staff members.

Around 8 PM, the Japanese authorities sent more plainclothes agents. At this time, the public security chief of the Shibuya Police Station, Takahashi, vigorously defended these two "journalists" and attempted to let the provocateurs go.

Around 10 PM, the Japanese reactionary government dispatched a large number of police and plainclothes agents to the residence of Chinese personnel in Japan to provoke and beat up two drivers.

At 11 PM, the representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office informed the responsible person at the Takasugi Office to convey the Liaozhengzhi Office's strongest protest to the Sato government.

On the morning of the 9th, Chinese journalists in Japan received reliable information that right-wing thugs, under the protection of the Japanese police authorities, were preparing to provoke incidents at the residence of Chinese personnel in Japan. The responsible person for Chinese journalists in Japan, on behalf of all Chinese personnel in Japan, immediately protested through the Takasugi Office to the Japanese police authorities, demanding that they stop the thugs' provocations and guarantee the normal activities of Chinese personnel in Japan. Otherwise, all consequences arising from this must be borne by the Sato government.

However, the Japanese police authorities completely ignored the warnings from Chinese personnel in Japan and took no measures.

At 2 PM, cars loaded with fascist thugs wielding sticks, playing Japanese militaristic songs, under the protection of the Japanese police, came to the residence of Chinese personnel in Japan to provoke. The head of the "Japanese Patriotic Party" violence gang, Akabane Toshio, stood on the car and shamelessly slandered the great leader of the Chinese people and the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the People's Republic of China. Chinese personnel in Japan and Japanese friends who rushed to the scene were furious and immediately protested to the Japanese police who were indulging the thugs, demanding that they immediately stop the thugs' atrocities. However, the police not only ignored this but also committed fascist atrocities against the unarmed Chinese personnel in Japan, suppressing their legitimate protests. Many Chinese personnel in Japan were injured.

Under the indulgence of the Japanese police, the right-wing thugs provoked incidents in front of the residence of Chinese personnel in Japan for one and a half hours.

Chinese personnel in Japan, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, fearlessly fought back. Under the swinging sticks of the right-wing thugs and the police, they stood fearlessly, shouting, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" While resisting and counterattacking the police's atrocities, they sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and sternly rebuked the enemy's slander and defamation.

Japanese friends from various circles and patriotic overseas Chinese rushed to the scene to support the just struggle of Chinese personnel in Japan. Japanese friends and Chinese personnel in Japan held hands and fought side by side, demonstrating the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and the high internationalist spirit of the Japanese revolutionary people.

Due to the resolute counterattack of Chinese personnel in Japan and the strong protests and condemnations of Japanese friends, the right-wing thugs fled in disarray under the protection of the police at 3:30 PM. At this time, two police officers from the Shibuya Police Station in Tokyo, who were responsible for commanding the scene and had not yet escaped, admitted their crimes of sheltering the thugs under the stern reproach of Chinese personnel in Japan and the broad friends in Japan. At this time, Takasugi Office's Dajunbo and others were also present.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tokyo on the 10th, the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo and Chinese journalists in Japan held a press conference in the evening of the 9th.

The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo, Wu Xudong, pointed out at the press conference: "The events of the 8th and 9th show that the Sato government's evil deeds of obstructing and destroying the normal work of Chinese personnel in Japan and persecuting them have reached an intolerable level of arrogance. This is a serious step in the Sato government's reactionary policy of being pro-American, pro-Soviet, anti-China, anti-people, and destroying Sino-Japanese friendship and Sino-Japanese trade. It is a new escalation of its frenzied anti-China actions."

Wu Xudong said: "The Sato government must bear all the serious consequences arising from its anti-China actions."

Wu Xudong also announced that the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo and Chinese journalists in Japan, through the Takasugi Office, have made the following three demands to the Sato government:

1. The Japanese authorities must publicly admit their mistakes and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future;
2. Severely punish the Japanese police and their instigators who committed atrocities against Chinese personnel;
3. Reserve the right to make further demands on the Sato government.

Wu Xudong sternly demanded that the Japanese government respond promptly.

    一面加紧勾结蒋匪帮一面公然制造反华挑衅事件
    佐藤政府竟出动警察暴徒打伤
    我驻日人员我驻日人员英勇斗争得到日本朋友声援　吴曙东最强烈抗议日本当局的暴行
    据新华社东京十日电正当日本首相佐藤荣作不顾中日两国人民的强烈反对去台湾同蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结的时候，日本反动政府于八、九两日竟制造事端，出动大批警察、特务和暴徒，打伤我国廖承志办事处驻日人员、中国驻日记者和工作人员多人，又一次制造了极其严重的反华法西斯暴行事件。
    八日下午五点，廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所为抗议佐藤荣作“访问”台湾举行记者招待会时，为美帝效劳的最反动的时事通讯社的“记者”，在未被我邀请的情况下，硬要钻进会场，当即被中国驻日人员拒绝。
    当晚七点，另有两名自称时事通讯社的“记者”，到廖承志办事处驻地寻衅。蛮横无理地叫嚣“为什么记者招待会不请时事通讯社”，并且强求会见廖承志办事处负责人，扬言要“追究原因”。中国工作人员对这种无理取闹的挑衅行为，当即予以顶回。这两个人还叫嚷“要拍摄廖承志办事处住所照片”，中国工作人员一再提出警告：未经中国工作人员同意，不得拍摄。他们不顾中国工作人员劝阻，不仅拍摄了驻所楼房，并拍摄了中国工作人员头像。
    八点多，日本政府当局增派了便衣特务。这时，涩谷警察署公安股长高桥，竭力为这两个“记者”辩护，并企图放走挑衅者。
    十点多钟，日本反动政府竟派了大批警察和便衣特务来中国驻日人员住所挑衅，殴打了两名司机。
    十一点钟，廖承志办事处代表向高碕办事处负责人提出，要他转告廖承志办事处对佐藤政府当局提出最强烈的抗议。
    九日上午，中国驻日记者得到确切的情报，日本右翼暴徒，在日本警察当局的庇护下，准备来中国驻日人员住处挑衅。中国驻日记者负责人，代表中国驻日全体人员当即通过高碕办事处向日本警察当局提出抗议，要求它阻止暴徒的挑衅，保证中国驻日人员正常活动，否则由此引起的一切后果必须由佐藤政府负责。
    但是日本警察当局完全无视中国驻日人员的警告，竟未采取任何措施。
    下午二时，载着手执棍棒的法西斯暴徒的汽车，播送着日本军国主义歌曲，在日本警察的保护下，来到中国驻日人员住所挑衅。“日本爱国党”暴力团头目赤尾敏站在汽车上，肆无忌惮地诬蔑中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席、中国共产党和中华人民共和国。中国驻日工作人员和闻讯赶来的日本朋友怒不可遏，立即向在场纵容暴徒的日本警察提出抗议，愤怒要求他们马上制止暴徒的暴行。但是，警察不仅置之不理，反而对赤手空拳的中国驻日工作人员施加法西斯暴行，镇压中国驻日人员的正当的抗议行动。打伤中国驻日人员多人。
    在日本警察的纵容下，右翼暴徒竟在中国驻日人员住处前面挑衅达一个半小时之久。
    中国驻日人员遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不畏强暴，英勇战斗。他们在右翼暴徒和警察的棍棒挥舞下，面无惧色，高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”，一面抵抗和反击警察的暴行，一面齐声高唱毛主席语录歌，并义正词严地怒斥敌人的诽谤和诬蔑。
    日本各界朋友和爱国华侨闻讯后纷纷赶来声援中国驻日人员的正义斗争。日本朋友和中国驻日人员紧挽着手，并肩斗争，表现了日中两国人民的战斗友谊和日本革命人民崇高的国际主义精神。
    由于中国驻日人员的坚决反击和日本朋友们的强烈抗议和谴责，右翼暴徒于下午三时半在警察的保护下狼狈逃窜。这时，还来不及溜掉的负责指挥现场的东京涩谷警察署的两名警官，在中国驻日人员和日本广大朋友的严词指责下不得不供认了他们庇护暴徒的罪行。这时，高碕办事处大久保任晴等人也在场。
    据新华社东京十日电廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所和中国驻日记者九日晚间举行记者招待会。
    廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表吴曙东在记者招待会上指出：“八日和九日发生的事件表明，日本佐藤政府阻挠和破坏中国驻日工作人员的正常工作，并对他们进行迫害的罪恶行径已经发展到令人不能容忍的猖狂地步。这是佐藤政府推行亲美、联苏、反华、反人民、破坏中日友好和中日贸易的反动政策的一个严重步骤，是它疯狂反华的一个新的升级。”
    吴曙东说：“佐藤政府必须全部承担由它反华而引起的一切严重后果。”
    吴曙东还宣布廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所和中国驻日记者通过高碕办事处向佐藤政府严正地提出了下列三项要求：
    一、日本政府当局必须公开承认错误，并保证今后不再发生类似事件；
    二、严惩对中国工作人员施加暴行的日本警察及其指使者；
    三、保留对佐藤政府进一步提出要求的权利。
    吴曙东严正要求日本政府必须迅速作出答复。
