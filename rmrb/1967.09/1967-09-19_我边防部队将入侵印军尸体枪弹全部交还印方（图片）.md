Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Border Defense Forces, in accordance with the notice from the Chinese government, out of the desire to maintain friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, on the afternoon of September 16, on the Chinese side of the Sino-Indian border, handed over to Indian representatives the 14 bodies of Indian soldiers and their weapons and ammunition left behind when they intruded into China. These bodies and military supplies were abandoned by Indian soldiers on September 11 when they crossed the Sino-Indian border to launch armed provocations against China and were repulsed by Chinese border defense forces.

Indian representative Major Chankara signed the handover list after checking the bodies of Indian soldiers and their weapons and ammunition. The list, written in both Chinese and Indian languages, states: "On September 11, 1967, the Indian military intruded into Chinese territory to carry out military provocations, leaving behind bodies and military supplies in Chinese territory."

Following Chinese regulations, the Indian personnel carrying the Red Cross flag collected and signed for the 14 bodies of Indian soldiers killed in the intrusion into Chinese territory. After signing, they carried the bodies out of Chinese territory.
