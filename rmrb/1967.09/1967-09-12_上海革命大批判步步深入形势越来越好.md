Mao Zedong's revolutionary line is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; the Chinese Khrushchev is surrounded on all sides

The revolutionary criticism in Shanghai is deepening step by step, and the situation is getting better and better. Broad revolutionary masses are actively participating in the revolutionary criticism, forming a magnificent "people's war." In the revolutionary criticism, they are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, reaching a new level in understanding and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They are closely combining the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units, making it both spectacular and solid, promoting revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The situation of revolutionary criticism in Shanghai is excellent and getting better. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the proletarian headquarters has issued an important battle order: closely following the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai immediately responded and, with the most resolute, enthusiastic, active, and swift fighting posture, launched a broader and deeper new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

The excellent situation of revolutionary criticism in Shanghai is first manifested in the fact that the masses have been truly mobilized, forming a magnificent "people's war." Streets are filled with countless revolutionary criticism columns, and units are echoing with angry slogans denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad masses of workers and peasants in Shanghai are the main force of this "people's war," and the million workers with glorious revolutionary traditions are at the forefront of the struggle.

The main feature of this magnificent "people's war" is the high level of consciousness of the revolutionary masses towards this criticism. This high level of consciousness comes from the correct understanding of the strategic significance of the criticism. Through the great practice of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary people of Shanghai deeply understand that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The proletarian revolutionary faction not only needs to seize power organizationally but also needs to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Criticism is a top priority for the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize and use power properly. Without criticism, the seized power may be lost again. An old worker said well: "Where there is no good criticism, there will be revisionism; whoever does not engage in criticism, revisionism will emerge in their mind." This is a profound truth!

The second feature of this "people's war" of criticism is that the criticism movement is both spectacular and solid. Meetings to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai have been held continuously for several months without interruption. These criticism meetings are grand in scale, powerful in force, factual, reasonable, hitting the target, and deeply critical. More notably, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai have created various new forms of criticism in their revolutionary practice, such as team criticism, field criticism, and shop criticism. These criticism activities are small in scale, flexible, and everyone can participate, criticizing deeply and thoroughly, solidly and persistently. In addition, mass criticism is combined with professional personnel writing key criticism articles. A series of criticism articles jointly published by the editorial departments of Wenhui Daily, Liberation Daily, and Branch Life are based on mass criticism and, in turn, have raised the level of mass criticism.

The third feature of this criticism is that leaders at all levels from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee to the grassroots, and the heads of revolutionary mass organizations, take the lead in participating in the criticism. "Leaders lead the way, and the masses are enthusiastic." Since early August, various levels of leadership organs have held criticism study meetings, and many heads of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary leading cadres have gone to the grassroots to participate in criticism with the masses.

The excellent situation of revolutionary criticism in Shanghai is also manifested in the fact that intensive study promotes criticism, and criticism promotes intensive study. "To fight wolves, you need a stick; to fight tigers, you need a gun; to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, you need Mao Zedong Thought." This is the personal experience of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai in the revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary criticism has become a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; revolutionary criticism has brought about the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, and the people's understanding and application of Mao Zedong Thought have reached a new level.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai, through the intensive study and application of Chairman Mao's series of brilliant works, has greatly enhanced the consciousness of revolutionary criticism and overcome various confused thoughts.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There must be comparison to distinguish. With distinction, there is struggle, and with struggle, there is development." The proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai is exactly like this, learning in struggle and using in struggle, universally using the "four comparisons" method, that is: learning what Chairman Mao teaches, comparing what the Chinese Khrushchev poisons, finding out what the unit does, and then comparing what one thought in the past. The more they criticize, the more energetic they become, and the deeper they criticize. They realize that to distinguish between socialism and capitalism; between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionist thought; between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, one must honestly sit down and seriously study Chairman Mao's works. They say: "Chairman Mao's teachings are in our hearts, and we can distinguish between the red line and the black line."

Looking at today's Shanghai, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the entire city!

The excellent situation of revolutionary criticism in Shanghai is also manifested in the fact that the proletarian revolutionary faction and the revolutionary masses are seriously summarizing experiences and gradually deepening the criticism movement.

First, they are working hard on the key issues. The revolutionary armies on various fronts in Shanghai are wielding the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to seize the key issues of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai usurping the party and the government, and the issue of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road, pursuing and investigating deeply. Many units have formed special investigation teams to understand the evil activities of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, in order to eliminate the poison of revisionism.

Second, they are closely combining criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. The proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai, in the criticism, closely combines it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. They believe that the black hand of the Chinese Khrushchev reaches far, and the poison spreads widely. To carry out the criticism deeply and thoroughly, it is necessary to eliminate his poison in their own units. They start from the severe facts of class struggle in their own units, directly attacking the bourgeois headquarters represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. The masses reflect that this criticism is "clear to see, fierce to criticize, easy to listen to, easy to remember, and easy to apply."

Third, they are using criticism as the main line to promote various work. Revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The number of units achieving great unity is increasing, and the good news of establishing revolutionary committees is coming in continuously.

The revolutionary criticism movement in Shanghai has achieved remarkable results and brilliant victories, but the development of the movement is uneven, and the road ahead is not smooth. Currently, to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism movement, it is necessary to always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to mobilize the masses more broadly and deeply, to continuously enhance the understanding of the significance of criticism in the struggle, to enhance the consciousness of criticism, and to enhance the level of criticism. It is necessary to overcome the relaxation, complacency, and "good enough" mentality towards criticism. Recently, some comrades have begun to harbor the complacent thoughts of "criticism is good enough," "revolution is at its peak," etc. These comrades do not understand that if the revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev is not criticized deeply, thoroughly, overturned, and exposed, the revolution will be half-hearted. Therefore, for this key link of the revolutionary criticism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it must be grasped tightly, unshakably, and without the slightest relaxation or complacency.

"Let us pursue the fleeing enemy with our remaining strength," let the storm of revolutionary criticism be even more fierce!

### 上海革命大批判步步深入形势越来越好

    毛主席的革命路线深入人心　中国赫鲁晓夫陷入重重包围
    上海革命大批判步步深入形势越来越好
    广大革命群众积极投入革命的大批判，形成了一场气势磅礴的“人民战争”；在革命大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想的理解和运用达到了新水平；紧密结合本单位的斗批改，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，推动了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    据新华社上海讯《文汇报》记者述评：上海革命大批判形势大好，越来越好。
    以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出了重要战斗号令：紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向以后，上海无产阶级革命派立即闻风而动，以最坚定、最热忱、最积极、最迅速的战斗姿态，更广泛、更深入地掀起革命大批判的新高潮。
    上海革命大批判形势大好，首先表现在：真正把群众发动起来了，形成了一场气势磅礴的“人民战争”。大街上设立了数不尽的大批判专栏，各单位纷纷传来声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的愤怒口号声。上海的广大工农群众，是这场“人民战争”的主力军，具有光荣革命传统的百万工人冲在斗争的最前列。
    这场声势浩大的“人民战争”的主要特点，首先表现在革命群众对这场大批判的高度自觉性。这种高度的自觉性来源于对大批判的战略意义的正确认识。通过伟大的“一月革命”的实践，无产阶级革命派和全上海广大革命人民深深懂得，革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级革命派不仅要在组织上夺权，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。大批判，是无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权的头等重要的大事。不搞大批判，夺得的权就有重新失去的危险。有一位老工人说得好：“那个地方不搞好大批判，那个地方就要出修正主义；谁不搞大批判，谁的头脑里就要出修正主义。”这是何等深刻的道理！
    这场大批判的“人民战争”的第二个特点是：大批判运动既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。各条战线批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人的大会，几个月来没有一天中断过。这些批判大会声势大，火力猛，摆事实，讲道理，击中要害，批得深刻。更值得注意的是，上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在革命实践中创造了班组批判、田头批判、店堂批判等多种多样的新形式，这些大批判活动，小型灵活，人人都可批判，批得深，批得透，扎扎实实，深入持久。另外，群众性的批判与专业人员写重点批判文章相结合。《文汇报》、《解放日报》、《支部生活》编辑部联合发表的一系列批判文章就是在群众性大批判的基础上产生的，这些批判文章的发表，又反过来提高了群众性大批判的水平。
    这场大批判的第三个特点是：从上海市革命委员会起到基层的各级领导和革命群众组织的负责人带头参加大批判。“头头带了头，群众有劲头”。八月初以来，各级领导机关相继举行了大批判学习会，许多革命群众组织的负责人和各级革命领导干部纷纷到基层去同群众一起搞大批判。
    上海革命大批判形势大好，还表现在：大学习推动了大批判，大批判促进了大学习。“打狼要有棒，打虎要有枪，批判中国赫鲁晓夫，靠的是毛泽东思想。”这是上海无产阶级革命派在革命大批判中的切身体会。革命的大批判，成了活学活用毛主席著作的大学校；革命的大批判，带来了毛泽东思想的大普及，人民群众对毛泽东思想的理解和运用，达到了新的水平。
    上海无产阶级革命派通过活学活用毛主席的一系列光辉著作，大大提高了革命大批判的自觉性，克服了种种糊涂思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“有比较才能鉴别。有鉴别，有斗争，才能发展。”上海无产阶级革命派正是这样，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，普遍使用“四对照”的方法，即：学一学毛主席是怎么教导的，比一比中国赫鲁晓夫是怎么放毒的，找一找本单位是怎么做的，再照一照自己过去是怎么想的。越批越有劲，越批越深刻。他们体会到，要分清什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义；什么是马列主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义思想；什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，就必须老老实实，坐定下来，认真学习毛主席著作。他们说：“毛主席教导记在心，红线黑线分得清。”
    喜看今日之上海，毛主席的革命路线，深入人心；毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，普照全城！
    上海革命大批判形势大好，又表现在：上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众正在认真总结经验，把大批判运动逐步引向深入。
    第一，在抓要害问题上狠下功夫。上海各条战线上的革命大军奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，抓住中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人篡党、篡政的要害问题，走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题，穷追深究。许多单位为了肃清修正主义的流毒，组成了专题调查组，深入实际，深入群众，了解中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在上海的罪恶活动。
    第二，大批判和本单位斗批改紧密结合起来。上海无产阶级革命派在大批判中密切结合本单位的斗批改，他们认为，中国赫鲁晓夫的黑手伸得很长，流毒散布得很广，要把大批判搞深搞透，必须肃清他在本单位的流毒。他们从本单位阶级斗争的严峻事实出发，直捣以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级司令部。群众反映，这种批判是“看得清，批得狠，听得进，记得牢，用得上。”
    第三，以大批判为纲，带动各项工作。革命的大批判推动了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。实现大联合的单位越来越多，建立革命委员会的喜讯纷纷传来。
    上海的革命大批判运动已经取得了显著成绩和辉煌的战果，但运动的发展是不平衡的，前进的道路也是不平坦的。当前，要深入、持久地开展革命的大批判运动，必须时时刻刻紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更广泛、更深入地发动群众，在斗争中不断提高对大批判的意义的认识，提高大批判的自觉性，提高大批判的水平。必须克服对大批判的松劲麻痹和“差不多”思想。最近，有些同志开始滋长了“大批判差不多了”、“革命到顶了”等等自满思想。这些同志不懂得对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线不批深、批透、批倒、批臭，革命将会半途而废，因此，对革命大批判这个文化大革命的中心环节，必须抓紧，不可动摇，不能有一丝一毫的麻痹松懈。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，让革命大批判的风暴来得更猛烈些吧！
