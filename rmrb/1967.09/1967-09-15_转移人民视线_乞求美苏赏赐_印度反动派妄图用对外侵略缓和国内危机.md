According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 14th, our correspondent reports: The Indian reactionaries recently brazenly dispatched invading troops to provoke Chinese border defense forces with armed provocations on the Sino-Indian border. One of their purposes is to divert the attention of the Indian people and to attempt to ease the anti-government and anti-hunger struggles that the broad masses of the Indian people have launched in various places.

The reactionary government of the Indian National Congress has long been dependent on the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists abroad, and has been oppressing the people with heavy taxes and extortion at home. After suffering a crushing defeat in the large-scale armed invasion against China in 1962, it has increased military spending by nearly fourfold in the past five years. India has now become the country with the most debt in the world, and its debts will not be paid off until the next century. India is also the country with the most starving people in the world. Every year, tens of millions of people die of starvation.

In recent years, India's economy has been deteriorating. Coupled with consecutive years of poor harvests, devaluation of the rupee, and further price increases, in the past year, India's prices have risen by 20%. Various oppressive taxes have also weighed heavily on the people. The total tax revenue of the Indian government, which was approximately 6.6% of national income in the 1950-1951 fiscal year, has increased to 19% in the 1966-1967 fiscal year. In this fiscal year, the Indian reactionary government has also stipulated an increase in taxes on various daily necessities closely related to the lives of the working people, causing the expenses of ordinary households to increase by about 30%.

After consecutive years of poor harvests, India's factories are also closing down and halting production one after another. More and more workers and agricultural laborers are unemployed and in debt. It is revealed that in Calcutta alone, about 50,000 workers from machinery manufacturing companies are wandering the streets due to factory closures and layoffs. Among nearly 100 million agricultural laborers in India, 85% cannot find long-term employment, and 91% of households are in debt. In Punjab alone, nearly 200,000 agricultural laborers have become debt slaves.

Recently, in eight of India's 17 states, there have been major floods, destroying crops over vast areas and leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.

Economic stagnation, soaring prices, famine, and widespread suffering, with the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer, have made the broad masses of the Indian people recognize the true nature of the Indian reactionary government and have risen up to launch anti-government and anti-hunger struggles.

In particular, the armed struggle of the farmers in Darjeeling County and its impact across India have made the Indian reactionary government extremely panicked. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Although the Indian reactionaries have used all their counter-revolutionary tricks, even resorting to armed suppression, the Indian people's struggle against tyranny continues in various forms across the country and is expanding and developing. Recently, the situation has made the Indian reactionaries' days even more difficult.

In August, the people of West Bengal and Kerala held large-scale anti-government and anti-hunger demonstrations for many consecutive days. In August, the number of strikes across India reached a peak. On August 23, in the Coromandel district of Madras, 50,000 textile workers went on strike, opposing the closure of six textile mills, causing 65 of the 82 textile mills in the county to be paralyzed. In the Indian capital of New Delhi, 30,000 teachers went on strike on August 21, demanding a wage increase. In Punjab and Haryana, more than 17,000 truck drivers have been on strike since August 5, opposing the Haryana government's tax increase.

It is precisely in the face of the serious domestic crisis that the Indian reactionary government is attempting to divert the attention of the Indian people and once again launch armed provocations against China. It also uses this to cater to the anti-China needs of the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists, begging for more handouts.

The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, has long taught us: "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet" is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of fools. If the Indian reactionaries do not learn from the lessons of their crushing defeat in 1962 and dare to launch another large-scale armed attack, then the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will certainly give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade!

### 转移人民视线  乞求美苏赏赐  印度反动派妄图用对外侵略缓和国内危机

    转移人民视线  乞求美苏赏赐
    印度反动派妄图用对外侵略缓和国内危机
    据新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：印度反动派最近悍然出动侵略军，在中锡边界向中国边防部队进行武装挑衅，其目的之一，就是为了转移国内人民的视线，妄图缓和印度广大人民在各地掀起的反暴政、反饥饿斗争。
    印度国大党反动政府长期以来，对外投靠美帝、苏修，对内横征暴敛。在一九六二年对中国的大规模武装进攻遭到惨败之后，又大量增加军费开支，五年里已经增加了将近四倍。印度现在已经成了世界上负债最多的国家，所欠外债到下一个世纪也还不清。印度也是世界上饿肚子的人最多的国家。每年总有上千万的人被活活饿死。
    最近几年来，印度经济每况愈下。加以连年农业歉收，卢比贬值，物价进一步上涨。在去年一年中，印度的物价上涨了百分之二十。而名目繁多的苛捐杂税，又压得人民痛苦不堪。印度政府的税收总数，在一九五○——一九五一年度约占国民收入的百分之六点六，到一九六六——一九六七年度已占到百分之十九。这个财政年度，印度反动政府又规定增加同劳动人民生活最密切有关的多种日用品的税收，使一般家庭的开支增加百分之三十左右。
    在农业连年歉收之后，印度的工厂也在纷纷倒闭和停工。越来越多的工人和农业劳动者失业，负债累累。据透露，仅在加尔各答一地，就大约有五万多名机器制造公司的工人由于关厂和解雇而在大街上流浪。在印度将近一亿农业劳动者中，竟有百分之八十五的人不能长期就业，百分之九十一的家庭负债。仅在旁遮普邦一个邦，就将近有二十万农业劳动者变成了债务奴隶。
    最近，在印度全国十七个邦中，又有八个邦发生了大水灾，广大地区庄稼被毁坏，成千上万的人无家可归。
    经济萧条，物价飞涨，饿殍遍野，民不聊生，富的更富，穷的更穷，使得印度广大人民认清了印度反动政府的本质，纷纷起来开展反暴政、反饥饿的斗争。
    特别是印度大吉岭县农民武装斗争及其在印度全国所产生的影响，更使印度反动政府十分恐慌。“星星之火，可以燎原。”尽管印度反动派耍尽了反革命两手，甚至进行武装镇压，印度人民反抗暴政的斗争，仍在各地以各种形式进行，而且在不断发展扩大。最近，形势的发展使得印度反动派的日子越来越不好过。
    西孟加拉邦、喀拉拉邦人民八月间连续许多天举行了规模盛大的反暴政、反饥饿示威。八月份，印度各地罢工事件达到了高峰。八月二十三日，在马德拉斯邦的哥印拜陀县，五万名纺织工人举行罢工，反对关闭六家纺织厂，使这个县的八十二家纺织厂中的六十五家厂子瘫痪。在印度首都新德里，三万名教师在八月二十一日举行罢教，要求当局增加工资。旁遮普邦和哈里亚纳邦的一万七千多名卡车司机从八月五日起一直举行了十一天的罢工，反对哈里亚纳政府增税。
    印度反动政府就是在国内的严重危机面前，妄图转移国内人民的视线，又一次向中国发动武装挑衅的。它还以此来迎合美帝、苏修反华的需要，乞求更多的赏赐。
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席早就教导我们说：““搬起石头打自己的脚”，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”如果印度反动派不吸取一九六二年的惨败的教训，胆敢再次挑起大规模的武装进攻，那么，伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军，对任何敢于来犯的敌人必将给予毁灭性打击！
