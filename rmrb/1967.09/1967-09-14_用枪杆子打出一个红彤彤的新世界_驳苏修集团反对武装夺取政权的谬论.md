Title: Use the Gun to Forge a Red New World – Refuting the Soviet Revisionist Group’s Fallacies Against Armed Seizure of Power

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally applicable."

The fundamental question of all revolutions is the question of state power.

The reactionary ruling class holds the state power apparatus in its hands. When the revolutionary movement develops to the point where it threatens their rule, they always resort to violence against the revolutionary masses, launching civil wars, and placing armed suppression on the agenda. Therefore, the revolutionary people can only, through armed struggle, completely smash the reactionary ruling class's counter-revolutionary armed forces, and seize power from the hands of the reactionary ruling class.

The Soviet revisionist clique is frantically attacking the brilliant proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Recently, the Soviet Union's *Red Star* newspaper published an article titled "On the Relationship Between War and Revolution," claiming that "there is no inherent functional relationship between war and revolution." "War and revolution are fundamentally different in nature."

This view, which completely opposes revolution and revolutionary war, is a thoroughgoing revisionist view. In history, all revisionists, without exception, have shouted for revolution while opposing revolutionary war. The traitor Kautsky, when attacking Leninism, proposed, "We must distinguish between social revolution, political revolution, and civil war." He attacked, saying: "Some people confuse civil war with social revolution, regarding civil war as the form of social revolution, and tend to justify the violence that is inevitable in civil war with the following reasons: that there has never been a revolution without violence in the past, and there will never be one in the future."

Lenin severely criticized Kautsky's fallacies.

Lenin said: "There has never been a great revolution in history without a civil war, and no true Marxist has ever thought that it is possible to transition from capitalism to socialism without a civil war." Lenin even more clearly said: "Revolution is war."

Revolution is war, Lenin's words are so clear and profound! Are you a true Marxist-Leninist? Then you must enthusiastically sing the praises of and support the armed struggle of the oppressed people; are you a revisionist? Then you must obstruct and sabotage the armed struggle of the oppressed people in every way.

Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is picking up Kautsky's old trash, attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, which fully exposes them as Kautsky's loyal disciples, as traitors no different from Kautsky.

The Soviet revisionist clique attempts to use the tactic of changing concepts to castrate the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism. The *Red Star* article says: "The socialist revolution is linked with revolutionary violence, with the use of violence to overthrow the capitalist system. However, this violence does not necessarily have to be linked with the use of weapons, with civil war."

What a "violence without weapons," "violence without civil war" revolution! Violence without weapons is not violence at all, and a "violent revolution" without civil war cannot be called a violent revolution. In fact, your tricks are nothing new, just a "peaceful transition" revisionist rag with a "violence" label stuck on it.

What is violence, what is violent revolution, the classic works of Marxism-Leninism have precise meanings, not something that can be arbitrarily changed by anyone. Engels said: "Revolution is the use of guns and cannons, that is, the use of extremely authoritative means, to force one part of the people to submit to the will of another part." Lenin said: "In the 20th century (and in the entire civilized era), violence is not a fist, not a club, but the army. To include 'disarmament' in the program is tantamount to saying: we are against the use of weapons. This has no Marxist flavor at all!"

Here, Engels and Lenin make it clear that violence is linked with the use of weapons and the establishment of armies. The Soviet revisionist clique's slogan of "not using weapons" and "not conducting civil war" can only show that they are scoundrels who have lost all Marxist flavor.

The Soviet revisionist clique is at their wit's end, resorting to insults instead of fighting. The article says to the Chinese people, who stand at the forefront of the world revolution: you "reduce the entire revolution to armed struggle," you propose "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," therefore you are "bellicose." Dear gentlemen, you are right, we are indeed the people who love revolution, this shows that we are completely loyal to the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Marx and Engels said: "The Communists do not conceal their views and aims. They openly declare: their goal can only be achieved by forcibly overthrowing all existing social institutions."

Chairman Mao, based on the principles of violent revolution revealed by Marx and Engels, and on the basis of summing up the experience of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, proposed the famous proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Now, this brilliant proposition is used by you as evidence to attack the Chinese people as "bellicose." This proves that you are not Marxist-Leninists at all, but thoroughgoing revisionists. Revisionists have always, together with imperialism and reactionaries of all countries, attacked communists who dare to raise the banner of armed seizure of power as "bellicose." They want to use such hysterical shouting to cover up their revisionist line of opposing revolution and strangling revolution. The logic of revisionists is that only the reactionary ruling class is allowed to wield the knife and kill, but the oppressed people are not allowed to defend themselves and counterattack. Do you want to resist? Then you are "bellicose." This is truly a reactionary logic that is outrageously absurd. A handful of revisionists want to use such a "tightening spell" to make the oppressed people stand still and wait to be slaughtered, which is completely a foolish dream.

"The seas are in turmoil, the clouds are angry, the five continents are shaking, the winds and thunder are roaring." Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the flames of armed struggle are burning more and more fiercely, a red new world must be realized!

    用枪杆子打出一个红彤彤的新世界
    ——驳苏修集团反对武装夺取政权的谬论		钟霄汉
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权。”“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题。
    反动统治阶级手里掌握着国家政权机器。当革命运动发展到足以威胁它的统治时，它总是对革命群众使用武力，发动内战，把武装镇压提到日程上来。因此，革命的人民只有通过武装斗争，彻底粉碎反动统治阶级的反革命武装力量，才能把政权从反动统治阶级的手里夺过来。
    苏修集团疯狂攻击“枪杆子里面出政权”这个光辉论断。最近苏联《红星报》刊登了一篇题为《论战争与革命的相互关系》的文章，胡说什么：“战争与革命之间没有内在的机能性的从属关系的联系。”“战争与革命首先在本质上是有区别的。”
    这种把革命与革命战争完全对立起来的观点，是彻头彻尾的修正主义观点。历史上一切修正主义者，都无一例外地空喊革命而反对革命战争。叛徒考茨基在攻击列宁主义时，就曾经提出，“必须把社会革命、政治革命和内战区别开。”他攻击说：“有些人把内战同社会革命混淆起来，认为内战是社会革命的形式，并且倾向于用下列理由来替那种在内战中不可避免的暴力行动辩解：即没有暴力行动就不可能有革命。据说在任何革命中过去总是如此，而且今后将永远如此。”
    列宁严厉地批判了考茨基的这类谬论。
    列宁说：“历史上从来没有过一次不经过国内战争的大革命，并且也没有一个真正的马克思主义者会认为，不经过国内战争就能从资本主义过渡到社会主义。”列宁甚至更加明确地说：“革命就是战争。”
    革命就是战争，列宁这话讲得多么的鲜明，多么的深刻啊！你是一个真正的马克思列宁主义者吗？那你就必然满腔热情地歌颂和支持被压迫人民的武装斗争；你是一个修正主义者吗？那你就必然百般阻挠和破坏被压迫人民的武装斗争。
    现在，苏修集团竟然重新拣起考茨基的破烂货，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，这就充分暴露了他们是考茨基的忠实门徒，是和考茨基一模一样的可耻叛徒。
    苏修集团妄想用偷换概念的手法，阉割马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂。《红星报》文章说：“社会主义革命是同革命的暴力，同用暴力推翻资本主义制度联系在一起的。但是，这种暴力不一定必须同使用武器，同国内战争联系在一起。”
    好一个“不使用武器”，“不进行国内战争”的“暴力革命”。不使用武器的“暴力”，根本就不是什么暴力，不进行国内战争的“暴力革命”，也不能算什么暴力革命。事实上，你们这一套并不是什么新鲜玩艺儿，不过是在“和平过渡”这个修正主义破烂货上贴上一张“暴力”标签罢了。
    什么是暴力，什么是暴力革命，马克思列宁主义的经典著作有其确切的含义，不是谁所能任意篡改的。恩格斯说：“革命就是一部分人用枪炮，即用非常权威的手段迫使另一部分人服从自己的意志。”列宁说：“在二十世纪（以及在整个文明时代），暴力不是拳头，不是木棍，而是军队。把‘废除武装’列到纲领中去，也就等于笼统地说：我们反对使用武器。这也和我们说我们反对使用暴力一样没有一点马克思主义的气味！”
    在这里，恩格斯和列宁说的明明白白，暴力是同使用武器，建立军队联系在一起的。苏修集团提出“不使用武器”，“不进行国内战争”的口号，只能说明他们已是没有一点马克思主义气味的下流工贼。
    苏修集团，已是黔驴技穷，只好用谩骂代替战斗。文章对站在世界革命最前列的中国人民说：你们“把整个革命归结于武装斗争”，你们提出
  “枪杆子里面出政权”，因此你们“好战”。可爱的先生们，你们说对了，我们就是好革命人民之战，这表明我们完全忠于马克思列宁主义的革命原则。
    马克思和恩格斯说：“共产党人不屑于隐瞒自己的观点和意图。他们公开宣布：他们的目的只有用暴力推翻全部现存的社会制度才能达到。”
    毛主席正是根据马克思、恩格斯揭示的暴力革命原则，在总结中国革命和世界革命经验的基础上，提出了
  “枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断。现在，这个光辉论断竟然被你们当做攻击中国人民“好战”的论据。这就证明，你们根本不是什么马克思列宁主义者，而是彻头彻尾的修正主义者。修正主义者从来就是这样伙同帝国主义和各国反动派，攻击敢于高举武装夺取政权的革命大旗的共产党人为“好战”的。他们想用这种歇斯底里的叫嚣，掩护他们反对革命，扼杀革命的修正主义路线。修正主义者的逻辑就是，只许反动统治阶级执刀杀人，不许被压迫人民自卫还击。你要反抗吗？那你就是“好战”。这真是混账透顶的反动逻辑。一小撮修正主义者，想用这样一个“紧箍咒”使被压迫人民束手待毙，完全是痴心妄想。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，武装斗争的烈火正越烧越旺，一个红彤彤的新世界一定要实现！
