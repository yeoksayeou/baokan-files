The armed struggle recently launched by farmers in Darjeeling District, India, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, marks a significant new development in the Indian peasant movement since India's independence. Indian farmers, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have broken through the frenzied suppression of the Indian reactionaries and the treacherous betrayal of the revisionists, and are pushing their heroic struggle to a new high tide.

Over the past twenty years, the Indian peasant movement has experienced three major waves of struggle, each with a broad scope and significant impact:

1. The armed peasant struggle centered in Telangana from 1946 to 1951.
2. The anti-eviction struggle from 1953 to 1955.
3. The struggle for land and against oppressive taxes from 1959 to 1962.

In the southeastern part of India, Telangana and other regions, farmers established a red regime in an area with over ten million people and waged a large-scale armed struggle for five years. Although this struggle was eventually suppressed by the reactionaries due to the betrayal of the Indian revisionist leaders, it provided rich revolutionary experience and left an indelible mark in the history of the Indian revolution. The insurgent farmers, with their blood, proved that the Congress Party government is the mortal enemy of the Indian people. Once in power, it stood on the side of the princes, nobles, and feudal landlords, ruthlessly suppressing the people.

Starting in 1948, the Congress reactionary government implemented a deceptive "land reform." In this so-called "land reform," the Congress Party not only failed to confiscate the landlords' land and distribute it to the farmers but also encouraged landlords to evict tenants on a large scale. Landlords, using excuses such as "self-cultivation" or farmers owing rent, taxes, or debts, arbitrarily expelled farmers. The broad masses of impoverished farmers were forced to rise up in the anti-eviction struggle.

This struggle began in parts of present-day Punjab and spread almost nationwide. When landlords attempted to evict tenants, entire villages or even groups of villages united to drive back the landlords, demonstrating a fearless fighting spirit. Farmers in West Bengal temporarily secured 30,000 acres of land, and in Bihar, they temporarily secured 50,000 acres. However, due to the power being in the hands of the landlords and the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, these lands were eventually seized back by the landlords under the reactionary government's brutal suppression.

Due to the influence of the revisionist line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the consistent opposition of the Indian revisionists to working among the peasants, the Indian peasant movement temporarily subsided from 1956 to 1958. However, by 1959, Indian farmers, oppressed by feudal exploitation and heavy taxes, spontaneously launched a new wave of struggle for land and against taxes. The center of this struggle was in West Bengal. Farmers rose up to harvest the rice on the land seized by landlords, refused to pay rent to landlords, and demanded genuine land reform. In Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, the most oppressed landless and poor peasants also launched struggles to reclaim wasteland and resist the government's seizure of land reclaimed by farmers. In early 1959, the anti-tax struggle in Punjab involved tens of thousands of people. The reactionary government carried out bloody suppression, arresting over 12,000 people and injuring thousands. The Indian revisionist leaders also helped the Indian reactionaries to disintegrate and suppress this movement.

By 1962, Indian farmers launched another wave of anti-tax struggles. At that time, the traitorous Deng Xiaoping clique had seized the leadership of the CPI, acting as a faithful running dog of the Congress reactionary government, and relentlessly betraying the peasant struggle. After the Indian reactionary government launched a large-scale attack on China, the Deng clique used reactionary nationalist slogans to deceive the peasant masses, urging them to cooperate with the landlord class to supposedly "strengthen national defense" and "increase production" as the "main tasks" of the peasant movement. Members of the Deng clique went to the countryside, propagating the idea of "farmers increasing production, landlords not demanding more," and calling on farmers to "eat one meal a day" and "donate" to the reactionary government's so-called "national defense fund." The brutal suppression of the Congress reactionary government and the betrayal of the Deng clique pushed the peasant movement into another temporary lull.

In 1964 and 1965, spontaneous struggles by farmers in various parts of India continued unabated. The reactionary policies of the Indian government led to increasingly severe food shortages. Farmers rose up to seize grain by force, distribute land, punish reactionary officials and landlords, and resist the persecution of reactionary police. Such incidents became more frequent.

These facts show that because the feudal exploitation system still exists in Indian villages, the contradictions between the landlord class and the peasants have not been resolved, and the land issue has not been resolved. The resistance struggles of Indian peasants and the land revolution will inevitably erupt and expand. Temporary setbacks will inevitably be followed by new surges. The armed struggle in Telangana was betrayed and suppressed, but after more than ten years, the farmers in Darjeeling District rose up again, establishing red armed struggle zones. After a long and tortuous struggle, the Indian peasant movement, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, will certainly achieve final victory. No matter whether it is the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, the Indian reactionaries, the traitorous Deng clique, or the Indian revisionists, they will not be able to suppress it but will ultimately be suppressed by it. This is the law of history. As the great leader Chairman Mao taught: "Struggle, defeat, struggle again, defeat again, struggle again, until victory—this is the logic of the people." The peasant struggle in India will certainly not deviate from this logic.

　　斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利
　　印度农民运动跨过曲折路程向前猛进
　　美帝苏修印度反动派丹吉叛徒集团和印修分子绝不能阻挡农民运动发展
    新华社讯　印度大吉岭县农民最近在印共革命派领导下开展的武装斗争，是印度独立以来印度农民运动的一个重大的新发展。具有光荣的革命斗争传统的印度农民，冲破印度反动派的疯狂镇压和修正主义分子的卑鄙叛卖，正在把他们的英勇斗争推向一个新的高潮。
    二十年来，印度农民运动已经出现过三次规模较大、范围较广的高潮，即：一九四六——一九五一年以特仑甘纳为中心的农民武装斗争；一九五三——一九五五年的反夺佃斗争；一九五九——一九六二年争取土地和反苛捐杂税斗争。
    印度东南部的特仑甘纳和其它一些地区的农民，曾经在一千多万人口的地区建立了红色政权，进行了长达五年的大规模的农民武装斗争。后来，它虽然由于印度修正主义头目的叛卖而被反动派镇压下去，但是它提供了丰富的革命经验，在印度革命史上留下了不可磨灭的一页。起义农民以鲜血证明，国大党政府是印度人民的死敌，它一上台就站在王公贵族和封建地主一边，残酷地镇压人民。
    国大党反动政府从一九四八年开始实行欺骗人民的“土地改革”。国大党在所谓“土改”中不但不没收地主的土地分配给农民，反而鼓励地主大规模向佃农夺佃。地主以“自耕”或以农民欠租、欠税、欠债为借口，任意驱逐农民。广大贫苦农民被迫起来进行反夺佃斗争。
    这个斗争，从现在的旁遮普邦的一部分地区开始，发展到几乎遍及全国。当地主夺佃时，整个村甚至几个村的农民集合起来，打退地主的进攻，表现了不畏强暴的战斗精神。农民们在西孟加拉邦暂时保住了三万英亩土地，比哈尔邦暂时保住了五万英亩土地。但是，由于政权掌握在地主和官僚买办资产阶级手里，因此，在反动政权的疯狂镇压下，这些土地终于被地主夺去。
    由于苏共二十大修正主义路线的影响，由于印度修正主义者一贯反对在农民中进行工作，印度农民运动在一九五六——一九五八年暂时低沉。但是，到一九五九年，被封建剥削和苛捐杂税压得活不下去的印度农民又自发地掀起了争取土地和抗税的新高潮。这次斗争的中心在西孟加拉邦。农民起来收割地主霸占的土地上的稻谷，拒绝向地主交租，要求实行真正的土改。在安得拉邦和马哈拉施特拉邦，受压迫最重的贫雇农也开展了争取荒地、反对政府夺取农民开垦的荒地的斗争。一九五九年初旁遮普邦的抗税斗争，参加的有十几万人。反动政府对他们进行血腥镇压，逮捕了一万二千多人，打伤数千人。印度修正主义头目也帮助印度反动派，瓦解和制止了这个运动。
    到一九六二年，印度农民又一次掀起了抗税的浪潮。当时叛徒丹吉集团篡夺了印共的领导权，它充当国大党反动政府的忠实走狗，竭力出卖农民斗争。在印度反动政府向中国发动大规模进攻以后，丹吉集团用反动民族主义的口号欺骗农民群众，要他们同地主阶级合作，以所谓“巩固国防”和“增加生产”作为农民运动的“主要任务”。丹吉集团分子到农村中宣传什么“农民增产，地主不多要”，号召农民“一天吃一顿饭”，向反动政府“捐献”所谓“国防基金”。国大党反动政府的疯狂镇压和丹吉集团的叛卖，使农民运动又暂时转入低潮。
    在一九六四和一九六五年，印度各地农民的自发性斗争仍然不断发生。印度政府的反动政策造成的粮荒日益严重。农民起来用暴力抢粮、分地，惩戒反动官吏和地主，抵抗反动警察的迫害等事件愈来愈多。
    这些事实说明，由于印度农村中封建剥削制度仍然存在，地主阶级和农民的矛盾根本没有解决，土地问题根本没有解决，印度农民的反抗斗争和土地革命总是要爆发，要扩展的。暂时的挫折以后必然又出现新的高涨。特仑甘纳的武装斗争被出卖和扑灭了，但是，过了十多年，大吉岭县的农民又揭竿而起，建立起红色武装斗争地区。经过长期曲折的斗争，具有光荣革命传统的印度农民运动一定要取得最后胜利。不论是美帝、苏修、印度反动派，不论是叛徒丹吉集团和印度修正主义分子，都不能压倒它，而终于要被它所压倒。这是历史的规律。正象伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”，印度的农民斗争是决不会违背这个逻辑的。
