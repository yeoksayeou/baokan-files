The speech given by a central leader at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee on September 1 is a new battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters to us. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Jiangtai Commune, are determined to respond to this great call from the Party Central Committee with practical actions. We will deepen the revolutionary criticism movement, be models in supporting the military, and achieve victories in both revolution and production.

In February of this year, the People's Liberation Army, in response to Chairman Mao's call, came to our Jiangtai Commune to "support agriculture." As soon as they arrived, they joined us in criticizing the reactionary fallacies of the capitalist roaders within the Party who opposed our study of Chairman Mao's works. They helped us establish "Mao Zedong Thought Study Groups" and the practice of reading Chairman Mao's works daily in our commune, production brigades, and production teams. The soldiers' mouths never leave Chairman Mao's words, and their hands never leave Chairman Mao's books. They constantly propagate Mao Zedong Thought and handle everything with Mao Zedong Thought, powerfully arousing the enthusiasm and initiative of our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works.

In the past, some bad elements of the old Beijing Municipal Committee spread the revisionist goods of material incentives and wage-based management here, fostering the idea of prioritizing sideline industries over agriculture among some people, seriously affecting agricultural production. After the PLA comrades arrived at our commune, they joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in severely criticizing the various counter-revolutionary fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev. At the same time, they went deep into the production frontline, participating in labor and helping to solve various problems. For example, our commune has a "Northern Wasteland" with over 2,000 mu of land. In the past, the capitalist roaders within the Party did not pay attention to it, the cultivation was rough, and the yield was always low. This time, the PLA comrades helped us transform over 1,000 mu of land. Currently, the corn in these fields is growing very well, presenting a scene of bumper harvest.

Now, domestic and foreign class enemies attempt to sow discord between the PLA and the people, which is a futile attempt! We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, love our soldiers most, and we will forever fight together with them, achieve victory together with them, and forever be heart-to-heart with the PLA.

　　贫下中农誓夺革命生产双胜利
　　北京市将台公社“抓革命，促生产”第一线指挥部
    九月一日，中央负责同志在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上的讲话，是无产阶级司令部向我们发出的新的战斗号令。我们将台公社的贫下中农和革命干部，决心以实际行动响应党中央的这一伟大号召，深入开展革命的大批判运动，做拥军的模范，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    今年二月份，人民解放军响应毛主席的号召，来到我们将台公社“支农”。他们一到公社，就和我们一起，共同批判党内走资本主义道路当权派反对我们学习毛主席著作的种种反动谬论，帮助我们公社、各生产大队、生产队建立了“毛泽东思想讲习所”，建立了毛主席著作天天读制度。战士们口不离毛主席的话，手不离毛主席的书，时时宣传毛泽东思想，事事用毛泽东思想来处理，有力地激发了我们广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作的积极性和自觉性。
    过去，旧北京市委一些坏家伙，在我们这里大肆宣扬物质刺激、工分挂帅的修正主义黑货，助长了一些人轻农业重副业的思想，严重地影响了农业生产。解放军同志来到我们公社后，和广大贫下中农一起，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种反革命谬论。同时，他们又深入生产第一线，一方面参加劳动，一方面帮助解决各种问题。如我们公社有个“北大荒”，有两千多亩地，过去党内走资本主义道路的当权派对它不重视，耕作粗放，产量一直很低。这次解放军同志帮助我们改造了一千多亩地。目前这些地里的玉米长得很好，呈现一片丰收景象。
    现在，国内外的阶级敌人妄图挑拨解放军和人民群众的关系，这是痴心妄想！我们广大贫下中农最爱自己的子弟兵，永远和他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起，永远和解放军心连心。
