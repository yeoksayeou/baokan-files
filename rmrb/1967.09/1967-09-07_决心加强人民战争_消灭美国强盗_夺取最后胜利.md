The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in its extraordinary conference, adopted a political program.

The current tasks and goals of the South Vietnamese people in their struggle for national salvation are: to unite all the people, resolutely defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, overthrow the puppet regime, establish a national democratic coalition government, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then achieve the peaceful reunification of the nation.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 6th – The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently held an extraordinary conference and adopted a political program.

The program states that in 1960, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was born and proposed a ten-point program aimed at uniting all the people to oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Since then, the National Liberation Front has united the broad masses of various classes, parties, organizations, ethnic groups, religions, and patriotic individuals to jointly wage the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The National Liberation Front has consistently received the wholehearted encouragement and support of the people in the North and overseas. The National Liberation Front has also consistently received the sympathy and increasingly powerful support of the peoples of the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos, the peoples of socialist countries, the peoples of nationalist countries, and the progressive peoples of many other countries, including the United States.

Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the people of the South have achieved one victory after another. The prestige of the National Liberation Front has continuously increased both domestically and internationally. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has become the sole true representative of the heroic people of South Vietnam.

The above-mentioned great achievements prove that the line and policies of the National Liberation Front are correct, and that the power of our people united in struggle is invincible.

The program states that although U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it still refuses to abandon its ambition to invade Vietnam. It is intensifying the war, ravaging the South, and increasing its bombing of our North. The heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism can only deepen and strengthen our nation's hatred and unyielding will against it. The people of South Vietnam have recognized the true face of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, hate them, and hope to contribute their strength to the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation.

In our nation's history, the momentum of the entire people uniting to kill the enemy and save the nation has never been as mighty as it is now. Our people are in a position of victory, initiative, and offense. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are increasingly in a passive, flustered, helpless, and failing position.

In this situation, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in the spirit of developing the past program, has put forward this political program to further expand national unity, mobilize and inspire all the people to press forward bravely, decisively defeat and annihilate the American aggressors, and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South.

Regarding the unity of all the people and the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the program states that since our country was occupied by French colonialists, our nation has waged an unyielding struggle for its own liberation. In 1945, our people, from north to south, rose up and won the August Revolution, seizing power from the Japanese military clique and its lackeys, and establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

When the French colonialists returned to invade our country, our entire people waged nearly nine years of heroic struggle, leading the sacred war of resistance to the great victory at Dien Bien Phu, shattering the invasion plots of the French colonialists and the intervention policies of U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism violated the Geneva Agreement, establishing an extremely brutal puppet regime in South Vietnam, plotting to turn South Vietnam into its new type of colony and military base, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam, and then invade the entire country, as well as establish its rule in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

U.S. imperialism is not afraid to use various brutal means to achieve its sinister plots. After suffering defeats in "special warfare," it launched "limited warfare," using more than fifty thousand U.S. troops and mercenary armies, as well as more than fifty thousand puppet troops to invade the South, while simultaneously waging a war of destruction against our North. It also intensified "special warfare" in Laos and continuously provoked Cambodia, aiming to destroy the independence and neutrality of that country.

U.S. imperialism uses various modern warfare tools and weapons, including strategic bombers, napalm, chemical poisons, and poison gas, to massacre our compatriots. It has launched successive "sweeps," implementing a policy of "kill all, burn all, destroy all."

It is clear that U.S. imperialism is the most brutal aggressor in history, the destroyer of the 1954 Geneva Agreement, the destroyer of peace and security in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world, and the number one enemy of our people and humanity.

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has continuously escalated the war but has been incessantly clamoring for "peace talks," attempting to deceive the American people and the people of the world.

The Saigon puppet regime has sold out South Vietnam to U.S. imperialism. They have brutally oppressed and exploited our compatriots in the South. They have forced South Vietnamese youth to fight for the Americans, killing their compatriots. They have also staged the farce of "constitution-making" and "elections" to deceive the people. They are merely a group of traitors who betray the nation, are tools of U.S. imperialism in enslaving our people in the South, permanently dividing our country, and serving the U.S. war of aggression.

The program states that the American aggressors and their lackeys thought that they could threaten our people with violence and deceive our people with tricks. However, they were greatly mistaken. Our people will never yield to violence and will never be deceived by them!

From south to north, our 31 million compatriots have inherited the tradition of our nation's indomitable spirit, resolutely stood up, and united as one to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation.

On the frontlines of our country, our compatriots in the South have, for the past thirteen years, displayed an indomitable spirit. All classes of people and all ethnic groups, regardless of gender, age, political affiliation, or religious belief, and regardless of whether they are in the mountains or the plains, have shoulder to shoulder resolutely waged the struggle to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the nation.

The program states that since 1965, despite the American aggressors sending tens of thousands of expeditionary forces to directly invade the South, our military and people have continuously achieved great victories, shattering the two dry-season strategic counteroffensives of the Americans, defeating more than a million enemy troops (including U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops). The liberated areas have continuously expanded, now occupying four-fifths of the land and two-thirds of the population in the South. In the liberated areas, national democratic power is being established, and a new life is emerging. While achieving great military victories, we have also achieved many significant victories in politics, economics, culture, and diplomacy.

In the beloved North, our 17 million compatriots are bravely defeating the U.S. imperialists' war of destruction, defending and promoting production, wholeheartedly encouraging and aiding the cause of liberating the South, and fulfilling the duty of the rear to the front.

The peoples of various countries, including the progressive people of the United States, are severely condemning the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression and sympathizing with, supporting, and aiding our people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Facts show that the more stubbornly U.S. imperialism strengthens and expands its war of aggression against our country, the more heavily it fails and the more isolated it becomes; conversely, the greater our people's victories, the more friends we have.

The program states that our people's most dangerous enemy at present is the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the traitorous puppet regime.

The current tasks and goals of the South Vietnamese people in their struggle for national salvation are: to unite all the people, resolutely defeat the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression, overthrow their puppet regime, establish a broad national democratic coalition government, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then achieve the peaceful reunification of the nation.

The force that guarantees the completion of the above-mentioned tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation is national unity. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has consistently advocated uniting all classes and strata of the people, all ethnic groups, all parties, all organizations, all religions, all patriotic individuals, and all patriotic and progressive people and forces, regardless of political affiliation, to jointly oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, reclaim various sacred national rights, and build the nation.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is always ready to welcome anti-American patriotic forces and individuals to join the National Liberation Front and jointly shoulder common responsibilities. Forces that, for some reason, do not join the National Liberation Front, the National Liberation Front suggests taking united action to oppose the common enemy, the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Fatherland Front of Vietnam, gloriously completing the common tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation, liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the nation.

The people of South Vietnam, while fighting for their sacred national rights, actively fulfill their international duties. The struggle of the people of South Vietnam against U.S. aggression is an inseparable part of the revolutionary struggle of all the peoples of the world.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is determined to stand united with the peoples of Indochina to oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackey groups, defending the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is determined to actively participate in the common struggle of the peoples of the world against imperialism, led by U.S. imperialism, which is warlike and aggressive by nature, to strive for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress.

The program states that the savage and brutal American aggressors are trampling on the mountains and rivers of our homeland. The people of the South must rise up to make a revolution, wage a people's war, annihilate them, and drive them out of our country, reclaiming national independence and sovereignty.

After more than twenty years of war, our compatriots in the South yearn for a peaceful life and the reconstruction of our ravaged homeland. However, U.S. imperialism has trampled on this legitimate wish. Therefore, our people must fight the Americans to achieve peace based on independence. Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. Only true independence can bring true peace.

Our nation's enemies are brutal and stubborn. However, our entire people are determined to fight and defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys. As long as U.S. imperialism has not stopped its war of aggression, has not completely withdrawn all U.S. troops and all mercenary troops from our country, and has not allowed the people of the South to resolve South Vietnam's internal affairs without foreign interference, our people will resolutely fight to the end. The liberation war of the people of South Vietnam is long and arduous, but it will definitely be victorious.

Our people rely mainly on their own strength, while striving to win the sympathy, support, and aid of the peoples of the world.

To defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, our people are willing to make any sacrifice, with the spirit of everything for the frontline and everything for victory, enthusiastically contributing manpower, material resources, talent, and wisdom to the national liberation war.

The National Liberation Front advocates the development of liberation armed forces, including main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units, to strengthen the people's war, combining guerrilla warfare and regular warfare, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, shattering their invasion plots, and achieving final victory.

The National Liberation Front advocates the establishment and development of the political power of the masses, developing political struggle movements, combining armed struggle with political struggle and enemy work, forming a three-pronged attack, and thus defeating the enemy.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam advocates mobilizing the people of all classes in the cities and villages temporarily occupied by the enemy to wage the struggle in various forms, shatter the rule of the American aggressors and their lackeys, destroy "strategic hamlets" and "strategic villages," demand freedom, democracy, and national sovereignty, demand the improvement of people's livelihoods, oppose conscription, oppose slavery, and oppose decadent culture, and ultimately, together with all the people, overthrow their rule and seize power.

At the same time, the National Liberation Front advocates that the people of all classes in the liberated areas unite closely to establish a system of self-government, gradually realize local national democratic power, build bases; actively engage in production and struggle for national salvation; continue to resolve the land problem; build a new economy and new culture in the liberated areas, enhance the people's physique, to support the frontline and fight to final victory.

Regarding the building of an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, the program states that the people of South Vietnam are determined to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, and strive to establish a political system that guarantees the independence and sovereignty of the nation, the freedom and happiness of the people, heal the wounds of war, eliminate the social evils left by the American puppet regime, restore normal life, and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam. To achieve this goal, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam proposes the following specific policies:

　　越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议通过政治纲领
　　决心加强人民战争　消灭美国强盗　夺取最后胜利
    当前南越人民的救国任务和目标是：团结全体人民，坚决打败美帝侵略战争，推翻傀儡政权，成立民族民主联合政权，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国
    新华社河内六日电　越南南方民族解放阵线在最近举行的非常会议上通过了政治纲领。
    纲领说，一九六○年，越南南方民族解放阵线诞生，并且提出了目的在团结全体人民，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的十点纲领。
    从那时起，民族解放阵线团结了广大的各阶层人民，各个党派、团体、民族、宗教和爱国人士，一起进行抗美救国斗争。
    民族解放阵线一贯得到北方同胞和海外侨胞全心全意的鼓舞和帮助。民族解放阵线也一贯得到柬埔寨和老挝两个邻邦的人民、社会主义国家人民、民族主义国家人民和包括美国进步人民在内的世界上其他许多国家人民的同情和日益有力的支持。
    我们南方人民在民族解放阵线的领导下，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。民族解放阵线在国内和国外的威信不断提高。越南南方民族解放阵线已经成为英雄的越南南方人民的唯一真正代表。
    上述巨大成就证明，民族解放阵线的路线和政策是正确的，我们人民团结斗争的力量是无敌的。
    纲领说，目前，美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨重的失败，但是，它仍然不肯放弃侵略越南的野心。它正在加强战争，蹂躏南方，加紧轰炸我国北方。美帝国主义的滔天罪行只能更进一步地加深和增强我们民族对它的仇恨和坚强不屈的意志。越南南方人民都认清了美帝国主义及其走狗的真面目，都仇恨它们，并且希望在抗美救国事业中贡献出自己的力量。
    在我们民族的历史上，全体人民团结杀敌救国的气势从来没有象现在这样磅礴。我们人民正处于胜利的、主动的、进攻的优势。美帝国主义及其走狗日益陷于被动、手忙脚乱、一筹莫展和失败。
    在这种情况下，越南南方民族解放阵线本着发展过去的纲领的精神，提出了这个政治纲领，以便进一步扩大民族大团结，动员和鼓舞全体人民勇往直前，决战决胜美国侵略强盗，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的南方。
    关于团结全体人民，抗美救国。纲领说，自从我国被法国殖民主义者侵占起，我们民族为了求得自身的解放而进行了不懈的战斗。一九四五年，我国人民，从北至南，奋起胜利地进行了八月革命，从日本军阀集团和它的走狗的手里夺取了政权，建立起越南民主共和国。
    当法国殖民主义者卷土重来侵略我国的时候，我们全体人民进行了近九年的英勇战斗，把民族的神圣抗战引向奠边府的伟大胜利，粉碎了法国殖民主义者的侵略阴谋和美帝国主义的干涉政策。
    美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议，在越南南方扶植起一个极端残暴的走狗政权，阴谋把越南南方变成它的新型殖民地和军事基地，妄图长期分割越南，进而侵占整个越南，以及在印度支那和东南亚建立它的统治枷锁。
    美帝国主义不惜采用各种残暴手段来实现它的不可告人的阴谋。它在“特种战争”中遭到失败之后，就进而进行“局部战争”，使用五十多万美军和帮凶军队以及五十多万伪军侵略南方，同时对我国北方进行破坏性战争。它还加强在老挝的“特种战争”，不断地对柬埔寨进行挑衅，以破坏这个国家的独立和中立。
    美帝国主义使用各种现代化的战争工具和武器，包括战略飞机、凝固汽油弹、化学毒药和毒气，来屠杀我们同胞。它接连发动各次“扫荡”，推行杀光、烧光、毁光政策。
    很明显，美帝国主义是历史上最残暴的侵略者，是一九五四年日内瓦协议的破坏者，是印度支那、东南亚和世界各民族的和平与安全的破坏者，是我国人民和人类的头号敌人。
    几年来，美帝国主义接连进行战争升级，但又喋喋不休地叫嚷“和平谈判”，企图欺骗美国人民和世界人民。
    西贡伪政权把越南南方出卖给美帝国主义。它们极端残暴地压迫和剥削我们南方同胞。它们强迫南方青年给美国当兵，杀害同胞。它们还玩弄“制定宪法”、“选举”丑剧来欺骗人民。它们只不过是一群祸国殃民的越奸，是美帝国主义奴役我们南方人民，长期分割我国，为美国的侵略战争效劳的工具。
    纲领说，美国强盗及其走狗以为，使用暴力就可以威胁我国人民，玩弄手段就可以欺骗我国人民。但是，它们大错特错了。我国人民决不在暴力面前屈服，决不受它们欺骗！
    从南到北的我国三千一百万同胞，发扬民族顽强不屈的传统，坚决站起来，团结一致，抗美救国。
    在祖国的前线，我们南方同胞十三年来发扬英勇卓绝的精神。所有各阶层人民和各民族，不分男女老少，不分政治倾向和宗教信仰，不分山区和平原，都肩并肩地坚决进行斗争，以便解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    纲领说，一九六五年以来，尽管美国强盗派遣数十万远征军直接侵略南方，我们军民仍然接连取得巨大的胜利，粉碎了美国的两次旱季战略反攻，战胜了一百多万敌人（包括美军、伪军和帮凶军）。解放区不断扩大，至今已经占南方的五分之四土地和三分之二人口。在解放区里，民族民主政权正在形成，新生活正在出现。我们在取得军事上的巨大胜利的同时，还在政治、经济、文化和外交上取得许多重大的胜利。
    在祖国可爱的北方，我们一千七百万同胞正在英勇地打败美帝国主义的破坏性战争，保卫和促进生产，全心全力地鼓舞和帮助解放南方的事业，完成大后方对大前线的义务。
    世界各国人民，包括美国进步人民，正在严厉谴责美帝国主义的侵略战争，并且同情、支持和帮助我国人民的抗美救国事业。
    事实表明，美帝国主义越顽固地加强和扩大侵略我国的战争，它的失败就越惨重，它就越孤立；相反，我国人民的胜利越大，我们的朋友越多。
    纲领说，我们人民当前最危险的敌人是美帝国主义侵略者和卖国走狗伪政权。
    我们越南南方人民当前的救国任务和目标是：团结全体人民，坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻它的走狗伪政权，成立广泛的民族民主联合政权，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国。
    保证完成上述抗美救国任务的力量是民族大团结。越南南方民族解放阵线一贯主张团结人民中的所有各阶层和阶级、各民族、各党派、各团体、各宗教、各爱国人士，一切爱国和进步的人和力量，不分政治倾向，共同反对美帝国主义及其走狗，夺回各种神圣的民族权利，建设国家。
    越南南方民族解放阵线随时准备欢迎抗美爱国的力量和个人参加民族解放阵线，一起承担共同的义务。由于某种原因不参加民族解放阵线的力量，民族解放阵线建议实行团结行动，反对共同敌人美国侵略者及其走狗。
    越南南方民族解放阵线誓与越南祖国战线并肩在一起，光荣地完成抗美救国，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国的共同任务。
    越南南方人民在为自己神圣的民族权利而战斗的时候，积极履行自己的国际义务。越南南方人民的抗美战争，是全世界人民革命斗争的密切不可分割的一部分。
    越南南方民族解放阵线誓与印度支那各民族团结在一起，反对美帝国主义及其走狗集团，保卫越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    越南南方民族解放阵线决心积极参加世界人民反对以美帝国主义为首的好战和侵略成性的帝国主义，争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的共同斗争。
    纲领说，凶恶和残暴的美国强盗正在蹂躏我们祖国的山河。我们南方人民必须起来干革命，进行人民战争，消灭它们，把它们赶出我国的国土，夺回民族的独立和主权。
    经过二十多年的战争，我们南方同胞渴望过和平的生活，重新建设被摧残的祖国。但是，美帝国主义践踏了这种正当的愿望。因此，我们人民必须打美国佬，以便夺取在独立基础上的和平。没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。只有真正的独立，才有真正的和平。
    我们民族的敌人是残暴和顽固的。但是，我们全体人民决心战斗和战胜美国强盗及其走狗。只要美帝国主义还没有停止侵略战争，没有把美国军队和所有仆从军队全部撤离我国，让南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，自己解决越南南方的内部事务，我们人民就坚决战斗到彻底胜利。越南南方人民的解放战争是长期和艰苦的，但一定会胜利。
    我们人民以依靠自己的力量为主，同时努力争取世界人民的同情、支持和帮助。
    为了战胜美国强盗及其走狗，我们人民不惜任何牺牲，以一切为了前线、一切为了胜利的精神，踊跃地为民族解放战争贡献人力、物力、才能和智慧。
    越南南方民族解放阵线主张发展解放武装力量，包括主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队，以加强人民战争，使游击战和正规战结合起来，消灭敌人大量有生力量，粉碎它的侵略野心，夺取最后胜利。
