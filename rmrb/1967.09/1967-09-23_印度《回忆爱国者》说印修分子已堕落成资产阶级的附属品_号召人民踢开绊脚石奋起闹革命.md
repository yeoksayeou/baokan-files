Indian progressive weekly "Remembering Patriots" recently published an article condemning Indian revisionists for degenerating into appendages of the bourgeoisie. It calls on the broad masses of Indian laborers to rise up like a storm, sweep away, and thoroughly smash the existing reactionary ruling system in India.

The article says that during the twenty years of rule by the Indian National Congress government, its policies have tightened the noose of famine, price increases, corruption, and black markets around the neck of our country. This is reflected in the widespread discontent that lurks throughout the country, which has erupted into sharp class struggles in some places. The struggles of the Nagas, Mizos, and Santals in Naxalbari prove this.

The article says that the leaders who led the landless peasants' struggle against landlords are praiseworthy in their heroism, but the "left" Communist Party (referring to the CPI) newspapers and leaders condemn them as "extremists," "disruptors of party discipline," and have already begun expelling them from the party. The party leaders have also publicly stated that they have no connection with the developments in Naxalbari.

The article says that the behavior of these leaders is thoroughly non-Marxist-Leninist and contrary to the revolutionary spirit. They have been separated from the Dange clique for three years, but during these years, they have not even touched the peasant question and have not initiated any peasant struggles within the country. Today, the government is suppressing the starving people of Naxalbari. It is full of irony that those who pride themselves as Marxist-Leninists today support the stance taken by this government, which is controlled by monopolistic capitalists, capitalists, and landlords. They accuse the revolutionary faction within the party of "disrupting party discipline," using the same methods as the Dange clique to expel those comrades who criticized Nehru's role during the Sino-Indian border conflict on the grounds of "disrupting party discipline."

The article says that those who claim to be Marxist-Leninists today even condemn broadcasts from Beijing Radio, saying that Beijing does not understand the actual situation in Naxalbari. This is an old tune from the Indian bourgeois press. Everyone knows that during the struggle for freedom, when the Indian revolutionary spirit was high in the fight against the British, the Soviet Union did a lot of propaganda in favor of Indian revolutionaries to boost their morale. At that time, Britain and its Indian lackeys exerted great efforts to denounce the Soviet Union and made crazy accusations against it. Today, we cannot understand how those who shamelessly claim to be Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries can loudly oppose Beijing Radio's support for the Indian revolutionary faction.

The article says that we must remind the Indian laboring people that those who like to call themselves leaders of Indian Marxist-Leninists, whether from the right-wing Communist Party (referring to the Dange clique) or the "left" Communist Party, have abandoned the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line and have become appendages of the bourgeoisie. It is futile to hope that these so-called Marxist-Leninist leaders will lead the domestic struggles of workers and peasants. Therefore, for the Indian people who are suffering from famine, the only path left is to rise up like the people of Naxalbari and initiate struggles everywhere. It should also be clearly told to the masses that unless the central government and the constitution are thoroughly smashed and a government of the laboring people is established, no concrete results will be achieved in our country, no matter how "democratic" the governments established in various states are.

Similarly, the administrative machinery established and perfected by Britain remains unchanged. However, those so-called communists and Marxist-Leninists who claim to be loyal to the laboring people have not led any powerful movement to oppose the continued existence of this oppressive state machine.

The article says that the leaders of the Indian Communist Party have not done anything for the people, only maintaining their leadership positions. The fact is that most of the leadership of the Indian Communist Party is composed of people from non-worker or non-peasant families; on the other hand, their lives and lifestyles are quite comfortable and easy. Therefore, they cannot lead a revolutionary struggle in the true spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

The article says that the Indian laboring people should understand that unless they unite and rise up like a storm to sweep away and thoroughly smash the existing system, there is no hope of escaping their current miserable existence, and they will continue to be trapped in the parliamentary trap of the current leaders.

The article says that these "revolutionary" leaders, in the party magazines they publish, propagate Marxist-Leninist theory, but in reality, they are leading the people down the same path as Dange or Joshi and his ilk.

The article points out that as long as the bourgeois constitution and bourgeois laws exist, poverty, hunger, and corruption cannot be eliminated. The true way of liberation lies in revolution.

The article says that the practice of the so-called Marxist Communist Party, which has split from the Dange faction for several years, shows that they are no different from the Dange faction. They are equally infatuated with state legislative seats, central legislative seats, and ministerial seats. They do not cooperate with the struggles of workers and peasants and express indifference to these struggles, thereby tying themselves to the bourgeoisie to serve them.

The article calls on Indian workers, peasants, students, government employees, and intellectuals to be vigilant against the policies of these leaders that worship the bourgeoisie and to learn from the historical experiences of socialist countries to further strengthen the struggle.

    印度《回忆爱国者》说印修分子已堕落成资产阶级的附属品
　　号召人民踢开绊脚石奋起闹革命
    据新华社二十二日讯　印度旁遮普文进步周刊《回忆爱国者》不久前发表文章，谴责印度修正主义分子堕落成为资产阶级的附属品。它号召印度广大劳动人民象飓风般地奋起，扫荡和彻底粉碎现存的印度反动统治制度。
    文章说，印度国大党政府在它统治的二十年期间奉行的政策，勒紧了套在我国脖子上的饥荒、物价上涨、贪污腐化和黑市的绞索，这反映在全国普遍潜伏的不满情绪中，这种不满在有些地方爆发成了尖锐的阶级斗争。那加人，米佐人和纳萨尔巴里的桑塔尔人所进行的斗争证实了这一点。
    文章说，领导这场无地者反对地主的斗争的那些领导人的英雄气概是值得赞扬的，但是，“左”派共产党（指印共）报纸和领导人谴责他们是“极端主义分子”，“破坏党纪”，并且已经开始把他们开除出党。党的领导人还公开发表声明，不承认与纳萨尔巴里的事态发展有任何关系。
    文章说，这些领导人的行为是彻头彻尾非马克思列宁主义的，与革命精神相违背的。他们脱离丹吉集团已经有三年了，可是在这几年中，他们甚至都没有碰一碰农民问题，在国内没有发动任何农民斗争。今天，政府正在镇压挨饿的纳萨尔巴里人民。充分具有讽刺意义的事实是，以自称为马克思列宁主义者而自豪的那些人，今天竟支持了受垄断资本家、资本家和地主支配的这个政府所采取的立场。他们指责党内的革命派“破坏党纪”，使用了丹吉集团开除在中印边界冲突期间批评尼赫鲁所扮演的角色的那些同志的同样的方法，以“破坏党纪”为由把他们开除出党。
    文章说，那些自称是马克思列宁主义者的人，今天竟谴责北京电台的广播，说北京一点也不了解纳萨尔巴里的实际情况。这是印度资产阶级报刊的老调。大家知道，在争取自由斗争的岁月里印度革命派斗志昂扬地进行着反英斗争的时候，苏联作了大量有利于印度革命者的宣传来增强他们的斗志。在那时候，英国以及他们在印度的走狗也尽了很大力量来申斥苏联，并对它提出了疯狂的指责。今天，我们不能理解那些厚着脸皮地自称为马克思列宁主义革命者的人怎么竟大声反对北京电台给印度革命派的支持。
    文章说，我们要提醒印度劳动人民，那些喜欢自称为印度的马克思列宁主义者的领导人，不管是右派共产党（指丹吉集团）的，还是“左”派共产党的，都已经抛弃了马克思列宁主义的革命路线，变成了资产阶级的附属品，希望这些所谓的马克思列宁主义领导人来领导国内的工农斗争是枉然的。因此，对于被饥荒折磨着苦难的印度人民来说，留下的唯一道路是象纳萨尔巴里人民一样起来，在各处发动斗争。也应当明确地告诉群众，除非彻底砸烂中央政府和宪法，建立起劳动人民的政府，否则在我国就不会取得任何具体的成果，不管各邦所建立的政府是多么的“民主”。
    同样，英国所建立并使之完善的行政机器原封未动。但是，自称忠于劳动人民的那些所谓的共产党人和马克思列宁主义者并没有带头发动任何强大的运动来反对这个进行压迫的国家机器的继续存在。
    文章说，印度共产党领导人未能为人民做任何事情，只是维持他们的领导地位。事实是，印度共产党的领导机构大部分是非工人或农民家庭出身的人组成；另一方面，他们的生活和生活方式等等十分舒适安逸。因此他们是不可能以真正的马克思列宁主义的精神来发动革命斗争的。
    文章说，印度劳动人民应当了解，除非他们齐心协力，象飓风般地奋起扫荡和彻底粉碎现存的制度，否则，就没有希望摆脱他们目前生存的悲惨境况，他们将继续陷入现领导人的议会圈套。
    文章说，这些“革命”领导人在他们出版的党刊上大事宣传马克思列宁主义理论，但实际上他们在引导人民走上和丹吉或乔希之流所走的同样道路。
    文章指出，只要存在资产阶级宪法和资产阶级法律，就不能消除贫困、饥饿、腐化等弊病。真正的解放办法在于革命。
    文章说，所谓马克思主义共产党人同丹吉派分裂几年来的实践表明，他们同丹吉派毫无区别。他们同样迷恋于邦议会席位、中央议会席位和部长席位。他们不同工人农民的斗争合作，并且表示同这些斗争毫不相干，从而把自己系在资产阶级的裙带上为其效劳。
    文章呼吁印度工人、农民、学生、政府雇员和知识分子警惕这些领导人采取的崇拜资产阶级的政策，并且学习社会主义国家的历史经验以便进一步加强斗争。
