    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Our dictatorship is called the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This means that in the people's internal affairs, a democratic system is implemented, and the working class, together with all citizens who have the right to vote, primarily the peasants, exercises dictatorship over the reactionary classes, the reactionaries, and the elements that resist socialist transformation and socialist construction.

    毛主席语录
    我们的专政，叫做工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这就表明，在人民内部实行民主制度，而由工人阶级团结全体有公民权的人民，首先是农民，向着反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义改造和社会主义建设的分子实行专政。
