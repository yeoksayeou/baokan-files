The revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, and Anhui are earnestly studying Comrade Jiang Qing's speech. They resolutely carry out the important battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, focusing on revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and supporting the army and loving the people.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, after the Central Committee's Office issued a notice to earnestly study Comrade Jiang Qing's speech on September 5th at the Anhui delegation meeting in Beijing, the revolutionary masses in the capital enthusiastically supported it and took immediate action. They launched extensive study and discussion sessions, determined to unyieldingly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity, and do a good job in supporting the army and loving the people.

	The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Stamp Factory, who are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, earnestly studied and discussed Comrade Jiang Qing's speech. Everyone unanimously agreed that Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is the latest directive from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Comrade Jiang Qing's analysis of the current revolutionary situation is completely correct, proving that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. This is the greatest encouragement for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people engaged in revolutionary criticism and the heaviest blow to the domestic and foreign class enemies. We must earnestly study and resolutely implement it, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and do a good job in revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity.

	The broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers, and revolutionary cadres in various departments also launched study and discussion activities. They unanimously supported Comrade Jiang Qing's correct analysis of the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They stated that to consolidate the victories already achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to develop these victories, we must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down private interests and establish public interests. On the basis of a unified direction, we must quickly achieve revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," while doing a good job in supporting the army and loving the people. Throughout the city, we will form a more united and powerful cultural revolution army, launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and achieve new and more brilliant victories in the Cultural Revolution.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 17th, Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech on September 5th greatly inspired the revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai. They excitedly said: Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is a battle call from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and it is the voice of our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao. We firmly support this important speech and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely completing the battle tasks assigned to the revolutionary masses by Comrade Jiang Qing in her speech.

	Recently, the revolutionary masses of the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters" Zhabei Liaison Station, who have achieved revolutionary unity, said in their study and discussion of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech: Comrade Jiang Qing correctly analyzed the current good situation, which greatly inspired us and gave us tremendous fighting strength. Currently, the counter-revolutionary line led by the Chinese Khrushchev is heading towards total collapse, which is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must cherish this good situation, resolutely repel the class enemies' various plots to sow discord, create divisions, and shift our direction of struggle within our ranks. We must carry out revolutionary criticism, promote revolutionary unity, do a good job in supporting the army, concentrate our firepower, and direct our spears at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must criticize them deeply and thoroughly, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and overthrow and expose them!

	The comrades of the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee earnestly studied Comrade Jiang Qing's speech. They said: The class enemies want to destroy the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, want to destroy the great People's Liberation Army, and want to destroy the newly born revolutionary committees. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash their plots, firmly defend the proletarian headquarters and the People's Liberation Army, and defend and consolidate the newly born revolutionary committees. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, go to the masses, go to the front lines of revolutionary criticism, and together with the masses, achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	After studying Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, the Red Guards and all revolutionary teachers and staff of Shanghai Mechanical Institute immediately took action. Two Red Guard organizations that had been fighting for half a year formed a preparatory committee for revolutionary unity. They said: Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech provides us Red Guards with a powerful ideological weapon to defeat the enemy. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, forever following Chairman Mao. Whatever he says, we will do. We resolutely and thoroughly abandon the erroneous idea of "putting myself at the center," overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and vow to be the vanguards of revolutionary criticism and models of revolutionary unity.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hefei on the 17th, the revolutionary masses in Anhui Province have been earnestly studying Comrade Jiang Qing's speech on September 5th at the Anhui delegation meeting in Beijing. The broad revolutionary masses in the Hefei region unanimously agreed: Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is an important battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, pointing out the most important and critical issues in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and has extremely significant implications for promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui and throughout the country. Revolutionary comrades said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui, like in other parts of the country, has achieved great successes, and the situation is excellent! However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are unwilling to accept their failure. They collude with the ghosts and snakes in society, sow discord, use various vile means, spread rumors, and create divisions within the working class, disrupting revolutionary unity, attempting to protect themselves. Comrade Jiang Qing's speech sharply exposes the class enemies' plots of destruction in this good situation, arming the revolutionary masses with the keen insight of Mao Zedong Thought. We, the revolutionary masses in Anhui, will most resolutely carry out the call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, break through all obstacles, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, raise high the banners of revolutionary criticism and unity, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, creating a new Anhui that is red with Mao Zedong Thought!

	Comrade Jiang Qing's speech has become the action guide for the broad revolutionary masses in Anhui, and it is turning into a great material force. In the Hefei region, the situation of revolutionary criticism and unity in schools, offices, and factories is getting better and better. Some schools' revolutionary teachers and students warmly welcome students who have left school to return and make revolution. Some factory workers are uniting to carry out the movement of seizing revolution and promoting production, striving for victories in both revolution and production.
