The great news of Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing has stirred up the long border and coastal defense lines of our motherland. From last midnight to tonight, all the border outposts and coastal defense units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been immersed in the joyous atmosphere of celebrating a great festival. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live!" The cheers echo thousands of times from the decks of ships, frontline airfields, and forward positions, resonating through the seas and skies, and shaking the valleys.

The soldiers who have been guarding the coastal and border defense lines day and night over the past year have made tremendous efforts and contributions to defend the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The heroic air force and naval aviation soldiers have shot down invading American bandit planes and Chiang Kai-shek's American-made planes that have been harassing the mainland time and again. The heroic naval soldiers have repeatedly struck back at the enemies harassing at sea and have excellently completed the tasks of protecting fishing and escorting ships. The heroic coastal and border defense soldiers, together with the militia and the people, have repeatedly captured American and Chiang Kai-shek's spies, building an iron wall along the long coastal and border defense lines. The soldiers of the Tibet border defense units have bravely fought back against the Indian reactionaries' serious military provocations. In celebrating Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing, they passionately pointed out that our battle positions are thousands of miles away from Beijing, but every soldier's heart beats for Chairman Mao. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight there.

In the southeastern coastal areas, the land, sea, and air forces stationed on the front lines of Fujian, which are separated by a narrow strip of water from the islands occupied by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, have been holding celebration activities for days. The naval fleet on patrol at sea held a celebration meeting on the deck. Soldiers who returned from night patrols, soaked by the rain, rushed to the celebration meeting without changing out of their wet uniforms. Pilots waiting on the airfield to intercept the enemy held a lively discussion under the wings of their planes. Everyone discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, amidst the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They shared the boundless happiness of receiving the great care of the great helmsman Mao Zedong and expressed their boundless loyalty to the great leader Mao Zedong. On the front lines of the East China Sea and the South China Sea, many land, sea, and air forces that have made outstanding achievements in punishing the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits' harassment activities, and the broad ranks of soldiers and heroes, expressed their high morale at the celebration meetings, vowing to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote war preparedness. They will forge the coastal defense lines into an iron wall armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an impregnable Great Wall that no enemy can break through.

The soldiers guarding the coastal and border defense lines connected with the mountains and rivers of heroic Vietnam were extremely excited to hear the great news of Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing over the radio. The land, sea, and air forces in Nanning, Haikou, and other places held celebration meetings, and some marched in the rain. The soldiers who created a brilliant record of three victories in three battles in shooting down invading American bandit planes said, "Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing has given us boundless strength. We must do a better job of seizing the revolution and promoting war preparedness, and achieve new victories in defending the motherland's airspace, defending the Cultural Revolution, and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation." In the southwestern border region of the motherland, the soldiers known as the "Steel Sentry Post of Yamao Sort" were in high spirits. Here, the clouds and fog are dense, there is no grass or trees, the wind and snow are fierce, and there are no human settlements for dozens of miles around, making it extremely harsh. They solemnly swore on the mountain: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are forever your loyal red sentinels. Whatever you say, we will do; if you order us to stand guard at the windy and snowy Yamao Pass, we will definitely turn the Yamao Pass sentry post into a steel sentry post; if you order us to stand for how long, we will stand for as long as you order, and we will willingly stand guard for the people here for a lifetime."

In recent days, the border defense soldiers in Tibet, the Karakorum Mountains, the Ili River Valley, and the banks of the Heilongjiang River have been exceptionally excited. The soldiers of a certain unit, composed of eleven brotherly nationalities, beat drums and gongs to spread the good news everywhere. They wrote in their pledge: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are the people's army created and led by you, the revolutionary soldiers nurtured by your thoughts. Our hearts are forever loyal to you, to your revolutionary line, and to the proletarian headquarters headed by you." The units that won honors in the self-defense counterattack battle on the Sino-Indian border and the soldiers fighting sharply with the enemy on the border defense lines, the sentries patrolling day and night, were more spirited and high-moraled in the celebration activities, more vigilant, and strengthened their war preparedness. They expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve new victories in defending the great motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
