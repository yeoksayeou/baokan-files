	Capital revolutionary masses today gathered at the capital airport to warmly welcome the return of our embassy's charge d'affaires in Indonesia, Lü Zibo, and Second Secretary and Consul Su Sheng. They strongly protested the unreasonable expulsion of our diplomatic personnel by the fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution.

	Today, the capital airport was adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. The revolutionary masses waiting to welcome the red diplomats held up portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, and a large banner reading "Warmly Welcome the Return of Our Red Diplomats." They repeatedly chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" and "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" They declared: Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are determined to fight to the end against the Indonesian reactionaries and firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

	At 6:40 PM, the red diplomats Lü Zibo and Su Sheng, holding up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, and waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stepped off the plane. Relevant department heads Han Nianlong, Lu Xuzhang, and Zhou Yiping, along with representatives of the revolutionary masses, stepped forward to shake hands and greet them warmly. Comrades Yao Dengshan, Xu Ren, Zhao Xiaoshou, Chen Luzhi, and Cao Dalin, who had bravely fought against the reactionaries of Indonesia, India, and Burma, also came to the airport to welcome their comrades. Representatives of the revolutionary masses presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges to the returning Lü Zibo and Su Sheng. Lü Zibo and Su Sheng, together with the welcoming masses, waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly chanted: "Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
