A red thread has connected our hearts.

Chairman Mao said: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a spring thunder, resonating through every corner of the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill. Revolutionary workers throughout the mill, holding Chairman Mao's latest directive in their hands, with tears of excitement in their eyes, said: "Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a red thread that connects the hearts of all revolutionary workers in our mill. We will do as Chairman Mao says. We will level the mountains and quickly unite!"

Under the unified demand of the revolutionary masses and with the assistance of the Beijing Military Region Air Force's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the entire mill immediately launched a wave of revolutionary great unity.

The revolutionary great unity at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill has gone through a tortuous process. The mill has more than eight thousand workers and over twenty revolutionary mass organizations, divided into two major factions. In the past, each faction claimed to be the revolutionary faction, and unity required "me" as the core. On the issue of the number of standing committee members in the revolutionary committee, there were sharp disagreements, with each organization wanting to occupy more seats. Thus, after months of discussion, unity was not achieved.

This time, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, with the enthusiastic help of the stationed soldiers and the supervision of the revolutionary workers, the leaders of each faction sat together. They first studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and the "Three Articles," critically examined the "self" deep in their hearts, and conducted self-criticism.

The leader of the "Revolutionary Alliance" said excitedly: "In the past, we could not unite because our selfishness was too heavy, our mountains too high. That kind of 'only I am revolutionary,' 'only I am leftist,' and 'me as the core' mountainism became the stumbling block to great unity."

The leader of the "Revolutionary Committee" also criticized: "In the past, we were not satisfied with large organizations and looked down on small organizations, deliberately finding others' faults, and grabbing others' weaknesses to twist them. All this is unacceptable. In the future, we must firmly act according to Mao Zedong Thought."

At this meeting to discuss unity, everyone no longer boasted of their achievements or contested seats, but followed Chairman Mao's teachings, each speaking of their own shortcomings and conducting more self-criticism.

As the minds of the people were filled with more Mao Zedong Thought and less "self," problems that were once difficult to solve were easily resolved. Representatives of the "Revolutionary Committee" and other organizations said: "'Revolutionary Alliance' has more people and greater achievements, so the number of standing committee members should be more." The "Revolutionary Alliance" said: "The revolutionary cause is everyone's business, and it should be jointly consulted and treated equally. The number of standing committee members for the 'Revolutionary Committee' and 'Revolutionary Alliance' should not be less." As a result, with the help of the soldiers, the organizations discussed and, in just one night, the number of standing committee members was determined.

In the past, when discussing unity, the two factions sat across from each other, each devising their own strategies; now, in the negotiations, the barriers were removed, and everyone sat together, laughing and chatting, becoming more and more intimate and united. The great unity that had not been achieved in several months was realized in forty-eight hours.

At the end of the meeting, the leaders of the revolutionary organizations unanimously said: "Our process of unity is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the process of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. On this issue, we have all won."

### 一根红线把我们的心连起来了

　　一根红线把我们的心连起来了
    毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的最新指示，象一声春雷，响彻了天津市国棉二厂的每一个角落。广大革命职工双手捧着毛主席的最新指示，两眼含着激动的泪花说：“毛主席的最新指示象一根红线一样，把我们全厂革命职工的心连在一起了。毛主席怎么说，我们工人就怎么做，我们要铲平山头，迅速联合起来！”在广大革命群众的一致要求下，在北京部队空军直属队毛泽东思想宣传队的协助下，全厂立刻掀起了一个革命大联合的高潮。
    国棉二厂的革命大联合，是经过了一番曲折的。这个厂里有八千多名职工，二十多个革命群众组织，分为两大派。过去，各派都说自己是造反派，要联合就要以“我”为核心。在厂革委会常委名额问题上，一直存在着尖锐分歧，各个组织都想多占两个席位。就这样，谈了几个月，也没有联合起来。
    这次，在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，在驻厂解放军同志的热情帮助和广大革命职工的督促下，各派组织的负责人坐在一起，首先学习了毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，狠斗灵魂深处的“私”字，各自进行自我批评。
      “联革”负责人激动地说：“过去联合不起来，归根结底就是因为我们的私心太重，山头太高，那种‘唯我独革’、‘唯我独左’、以‘我’为核心的山头主义，成了大联合的绊脚石。”
      “革委”负责人也检讨说：“过去，我们对大组织不服气，对小组织看不起，专门找人家的缺点，抓住人家的小辫子还要往手上缠三遭。这一切都要不得。今后，我们一定要坚决按照毛泽东思想办事。”
    在这次谈联合的会上，大家不再是摆功绩、争席位，而是按照毛主席的教导，各说自己的缺点，多作自我批评。
    头脑里的毛泽东思想多了，“私”字少了，过去很难解决的问题，也迎刃而解。“革委”等组织的代表说：“‘联革’人数多，功劳大，常委人数应该多些。”“联革”就说：“革命事业是大家的事，应该共同协商，平等相待，‘革委’、‘联筹’的常委名额不能少。”结果，在解放军同志的帮助下，各个组织经过协商，只一个晚上，常委的名额就定下来了。
    过去在谈联合的时候，两派隔桌而坐，各商对策；现在在谈判中消除了隔阂，大家共坐一起，谈笑风生，越谈越亲热，越谈越团结。几个月没有实现的大联合，在四十八小时内就实现了。
    在会议结束时，革命组织的负责人异口同声地说：“我们联合的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，就是灵魂深处破私立公的过程，在这个问题上，我们大家都胜利了。”
