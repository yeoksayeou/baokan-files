The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China, strongly protesting the Indian military's crossing of the Sino-Bhutan border and infiltrating Chinese territory, as well as their outrageous provocations that resulted in injuries to Chinese border guards.

The note pointed out: Since the end of July, Indian troops have repeatedly infiltrated Chinese territory in the Naku La Pass, Cho La Pass, and Daji Pass areas along the Sino-Bhutan border, conducting reconnaissance activities, setting up iron stakes, and erecting barbed wire. They have even opened fire and provoked Chinese border personnel, insulting them. The most serious incident occurred on September 7 at 8:00 AM, when more than sixty Indian troops crossed the Naku La Pass, infiltrated Chinese territory, and set up barbed wire. Despite multiple warnings from Chinese border forces, they stabbed two Chinese border guards with bayonets.

The note pointed out that the Indian military's brazen infiltration activities are part of the current international anti-China chorus orchestrated by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, along with reactionary forces from various countries. The Indian reactionaries have repeatedly taken the stage in this anti-China chorus, performing with great enthusiasm. However, they also employ counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, recently releasing statements about resolving Sino-Indian disputes through negotiations and peaceful means, feigning a conciliatory attitude to deceive the Indian people and world public opinion. The Indian reactionaries' clumsy tactics are old tricks. They still attempt to deceive people, which only shows that they are at their wits' end.

The note pointed out: The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has taught us: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Indian reactionaries will also not deviate from this logic. The Chinese government solemnly warns the Indian government: The Chinese border forces are closely monitoring the situation along the Sino-Bhutan border. If Indian troops continue to infiltrate and provoke, all serious consequences will be borne by the Indian government.

### 我外交部强烈抗议印军侵入中国境内  印军如继续挑衅，印政府必须承担一切严重后果

    我外交部强烈抗议印军侵入中国境内
    印军如继续挑衅，印政府必须承担一切严重后果
    新华社十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天照会印度驻华大使馆，强烈抗议印军越过中锡边界，侵入中国境内，并刺伤我边防战士的疯狂挑衅行为。
    照会指出：七月底以来，印军在中锡边界乃堆拉山口、卓拉山口和达吉山口，多次侵入中国境内进行侦察活动，埋设铁桩，架设铁丝网，甚至开枪挑衅，辱骂中国边防人员。特别严重的是，九月七日八时，印军六十余人，越过乃堆拉山口，侵入中国境内架设铁丝网，并且不顾中国边防部队的多次警告，竟然用刺刀刺伤两名中国边防战士。
    照会指出，印度军队这种猖狂的入侵活动，是当前美帝苏修伙同各国反动派掀起的国际反华大合唱的一个组成部分。印度反动派在这个反华大合唱中一再登台表演，十分卖力。但是，它又玩弄反革命的两面手法，最近放出什么愿意通过谈判、和平解决中印争端的调子，装出一副要和缓的姿态，以欺骗印度人民和世界舆论。印度反动派这种拙劣的手法是老一套了，还想用这一套骗人，只能说明你们黔驴技穷而已。
    照会指出：中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”印度反动派也决不会违背这个逻辑。中国政府严正警告印度政府：中国边防部队正在密切注视着中锡边界事态的发展。如果印度部队仍然继续入侵挑衅，则一切严重后果应由印度政府承担。
