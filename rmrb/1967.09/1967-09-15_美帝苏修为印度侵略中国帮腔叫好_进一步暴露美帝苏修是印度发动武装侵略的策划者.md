The Indian reactionaries launched a military attack on China on September 11. Following this, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists activated their propaganda machines to cheer for the Indian reactionaries' aggressive crimes and to create counter-revolutionary public opinion for the Indian reactionaries to expand their aggression.

The U.S. imperialists and the Indian reactionaries have been singing in unison, strenuously defending the Indian aggressor army and viciously slandering China. According to a September 14 report by the Associated Press, the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, the *New York Times*, actually turned black into white, claiming that the fact of India's armed attack on China was China "inflicting harm on" India, and further slandering China as "war-mongering."

The United Press International on September 12 issued a dispatch, falsely claiming that the self-defense counterattack by Chinese border troops was a "manufactured foreign adventure." This news agency did not mention the truth that the Indian reactionaries launched an armed attack on China to beg for U.S. and Soviet aid and to divert domestic public opinion, but instead falsely claimed that China's counterattack against Indian aggression was to "divert domestic attention." The U.S. imperialists attempt to use these lies to confuse public opinion worldwide and to shift the blame for the Indian reactionaries' armed attack onto China. This can only further expose them as the planners behind India's armed provocations against China.

In this incident, the Soviet revisionists' TASS news agency once again played the shameful role of colluding with the U.S. and India to oppose China. Clearly, it was India that launched an armed invasion of China, but TASS on September 9 issued a report fabricating that "after a Chinese soldier shot at an Indian, there was an exchange of fire between Chinese and Indian troops." People still remember that eight years ago, it was on this very day, September 9, that TASS openly issued a statement supporting the Indian reactionaries' anti-China stance. This time, TASS fabricated that China fired the first shot, attempting to exonerate the Indian reactionaries of their anti-China crimes. After the Chinese Foreign Ministry on September 10 issued a note strongly protesting the Indian reactionaries' armed invasion of China and exposing the truth of the Indian reactionaries' aggression against China, TASS slandered China for "placing the entire responsibility for the incident on the Indian government." TASS also defended Indian expansionism. The Indian army's presence in Sikkim is based on an unequal treaty to enslave the Sikkimese people. However, TASS claimed that the "Indian army is in Sikkim to defend its borders." These shameless fabrications by TASS are another blatant exposure of the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the U.S. and India to oppose China.

    美帝苏修为印度侵略中国帮腔叫好
    进一步暴露美帝苏修是印度发动武装侵略的策划者
    新华社十四日讯　印度反动派在十一日向中国发动武装进攻以后，美帝苏修开动宣传机器，为印度反动派的侵略罪行帮腔叫好，并为印度反动派扩大侵略制造反革命舆论。
    美帝国主义同印度反动派一唱一和，竭力为印度侵略军辩护，恶毒诽谤中国。据美联社十四日透露，美国垄断资本的喉舌《纽约时报》竟颠倒黑白，把印度武装进攻中国的事实硬说成是中国“加害于”印度，并诬蔑中国“好战”。
    美国合众国际社十二日发出电讯，胡说什么中国边防部队的自卫反击是“制造对外冒险行动”。这家通讯社只字不提印度反动派为了乞求美苏施舍和转移国内人民的视线而向中国发动武装进攻的真相，竟胡说什么中国反击印度侵略是为了“转移国内视线”。美帝国主义企图用这些谎言在全世界混淆视听，把印度反动派发动武装进攻的罪责推到中国身上，这只能进一步暴露它是印度向中国进行武装挑衅的策划者。
    苏修的塔斯社在这次事件中又一次扮演了勾结美帝联印反华的可耻角色。明明是印度向中国发动武装侵略，可是，塔斯社却在九日发表消息造谣说：“在一个中国士兵射击了印度人之后发生了中国军队和印度军队之间的射击”。人们还清楚记得，八年前，正是这个塔斯社在九月九日这一天，公开发表了支持印度反动派反华的声明。这次塔斯社又捏造中国先开第一枪，妄图为印度反动派反华开脱罪责。中国外交部在九月十日发表照会，强烈抗议印度反动派武装侵略中国，并揭露了印度反动派侵略中国的真相以后，塔斯社竟诬蔑中国把“事件的全部责任都加之于印度政府。”塔斯社还为印度的扩张主义辩护。印度军队呆在锡金是根据不平等条约奴役锡金人民的。但是，塔斯社却说什么“印度军队在锡金是为了保卫它的边界。”塔斯社这些无耻谰言，是苏修伙同美帝联印反华的又一次大暴露。
