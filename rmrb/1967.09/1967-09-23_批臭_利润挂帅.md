The top echelon of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai have consistently advocated the fallacy of "profit first," claiming that "an enterprise without profits is an enterprise without vitality." They say, "A factory must make money; if it does not contribute profits to the state, it should shut down and stop paying wages." This is actually a rejection of political leadership, turning our socialist enterprises into capitalist ones that pursue profits by any means necessary, thereby undermining the economic foundation of our socialist country. Following the black directives of Chinese Khrushchev and others, the capitalist roaders within our factory have implemented a "profit first" management system, which has had very negative effects in practice.

In the pursuit of profits and contributions to the state, they resort to bourgeois methods. For example, making oil drums could use ordinary thin steel plates. However, since the price difference between ordinary plates and high-quality plates is nearly double, our factory insists that sister factories use our high-quality plates and does not supply ordinary plates. To promote the sale of high-quality plates, they even undermine sister factories by claiming their products are inferior to ours. For certain products with small batch quantities and thin profits, they are unwilling to accept orders. For some new products, they see trial production as an opportunity to make money, arbitrarily increasing trial production costs and burdening the state and sister factories. For raw materials entering the factory, they adopt price-cutting tactics to "reduce costs." This capitalist management ideology and style, which only cares about oneself and not others, seriously disrupts the state's economic plan and harms cooperation with sister factories.

To implement the "profit first" policy, they also introduced an "independent economic accounting system" within the enterprise, which means "all levels of the factory, workshops, and teams must implement economic accounting." Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our factory workshops have adhered to political leadership, promoting a communist cooperative spirit, mutual assistance, and support. However, after implementing the "independent economic accounting system," communist spirit and mutual cooperation and support were thrown out the window. The steel ingots from the steelmaking workshop had to be paid for when sent to the rolling workshop, and the maintenance workshop had to charge for processing a part for the production workshop. They even stipulated that workers in the workshop had to use "voucher tickets" to purchase tools and screws. The result of "profit first" is that the socialist cooperative relationships between workshops and workers have been reduced to naked monetary relationships, completely contrary to the nature of socialist enterprises.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the "profit first" black goods advocated by Chinese Khrushchev, insist on political leadership, and turn our factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 批臭“利润挂帅”
上钢三厂无产阶级革命派

　　批臭“利润挂帅”
　　上钢三厂无产阶级革命派
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人，一贯鼓吹“利润挂帅”的谬论，胡说什么“没有盈利的企业，是没有生命力的企业。”“一个工厂一定要赚钱，不给国家上缴利润，那就应该关门，应该停发工资。”这实际上是反对政治挂帅，把我们社会主义企业变成不择手段一味追求利润的资本主义企业，瓦解我国的社会主义经济基础。按照中国赫鲁晓夫等的黑指示，我厂党内走资本主义道路当权派在厂里推行了一套“利润挂帅”的经营管理制度，在实际工作中起了很坏的作用。
    为了赚钱，追求上缴利润，他们不惜采取资产阶级的手段。如做油桶本来是可以用普通的薄钢板的。但是，由于普通板和优质板的价格相差将近两倍，我厂就一定要兄弟厂用我厂的优质板，不供应普通板。为了多推销优质板，还挖兄弟厂墙脚，宣扬他们的产品不如我厂。对某些批发量小、利润薄的品种，却不愿接受。某些新产品的试制，也当作“发财”的好机会，任意加大试制费用，增加国家和兄弟厂负担。对进厂的原料，则采取杀价的办法，以“降低成本”。这种只顾自己不顾别人的资本主义经营思想、经营作风，严重地破坏了国家的经济计划，损害了同兄弟厂的协作。
    为了贯彻“利润挂帅”，他们还在企业内部推行了一套“独立经济核算制”，也就是所谓“企业的厂部、车间、小组，三级都要实行经济核算。”一九五八年大跃进以来，我厂各车间坚持政治挂帅，发扬了共产主义协作精神，相互协作，相互支援。可是，推行了“独立经济核算制”以后，什么共产主义风格，相互之间的协作、支援，都被抛到九霄云外。炼钢车间的钢锭运到轧钢车间要收钱，检修车间为生产车间加工一个零件也要收钱。他们还规定，在车间里工人领一样工具、一个螺丝钉，要用“代价券”购买。“利润挂帅”的结果，使车间与车间、工人与工人之间的社会主义相互协作关系，变成了赤裸裸的金钱关系，同社会主义企业性质背道而驰。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“利润挂帅”的黑货，坚持政治挂帅，把我们的工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
