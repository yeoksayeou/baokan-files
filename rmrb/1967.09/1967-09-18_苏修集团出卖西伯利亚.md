Recently, the Soviet revisionist leaders, through the Italian monopoly capitalist organization Fiat Company, have struck a dirty deal with the American imperialists. This company, using American loans and equipment, is building a factory in Ukraine that will produce 600,000 small cars annually.

Following this deal, the Soviet revisionists, through the American boss's lackey, the Japanese financial clique, are now making an even larger deal. This is the so-called "Soviet-Japanese joint development" of Siberia's oil, iron sand, copper mines, natural gas, forests, and other resources.

Since the end of the war, American capital has thoroughly infiltrated Japan's national economy. Most of the new technologies imported into Japan's various important industrial sectors come from the United States. It is precisely due to the support of American monopoly capital that the Japanese financial clique has been able to rise again. Therefore, the so-called "Soviet-Japanese joint development" of Siberia is actually a variant of the Soviet-American collusion. In the eyes of the Soviet revisionist leaders, by bringing in the Japanese monopoly capitalist group as a partner, they can deceive people, secretly introduce American capital and technology, and through the Japanese monopoly capitalist group, tighten their collusion with American imperialism and jointly oppose China. The Soviet revisionist leaders think that by using the Japanese intermediary, it will be more concealed than direct trading. In reality, this is a case of trying to cover up the truth, and the traitors' wolfish ambitions have long been known to all.

In order to attract customers in the grand auction of Siberia's sovereignty, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has shown an unusual enthusiasm. They have provided unprecedented concessions to the Japanese financial clique in trade and other areas. This year, the Soviet side did not insist on a trade surplus with Japan as in the past, but instead agreed to a Japanese trade surplus of $11 million. In April of this year, they also signed a Soviet-Japanese aviation agreement, agreeing to open Siberia's airspace to Japanese aircraft and personnel. Look! The Soviet revisionist leaders, in order to collude with American and Japanese monopoly capital, have become so heartless and servile, selling out the sacred sovereignty of Siberia behind the backs of the Soviet people, and have fallen to such a degree!

The Japanese financial clique and their American imperialist masters have long coveted the rich resources of Siberia. American imperialism intends to use Japan to extend its claws into the heart of Siberia, seize a large amount of wealth, and through this, plans to collude with the Soviet revisionists to turn Siberia into a base for invading socialist China.

The so-called "Soviet-Japanese joint development" of Siberia is actually a sinister deal where the Soviet revisionists sell out Siberia behind the people's backs. In this deal, the Soviet revisionist traitors can only get a few crumbs left over by American and Japanese monopoly capital, while the door to Siberia is wide open to American and Japanese monopoly capital. The forces of imperialism will then march straight in, and Siberia will fall into the sphere of influence of American and Japanese monopoly capital.

The "Soviet-Japanese joint development" of Siberia is an undeniable piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Soviet people and their collusion with imperialism, and it is another major exposure of their counter-revolutionary revisionist stance.

However, Siberia belongs to the various peoples of the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, to eliminate the White Guard forces of Kolchak that were entrenched in Siberia and to smash the invasion of Japanese fascists landing in Vladivostok, the outstanding sons and daughters of the various peoples of the Soviet Union fought in the vast snows, using their blood to defend Siberia. Today, the various peoples of the Soviet Union, who have the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will never allow a small group of traitors to sell the land they have watered with their blood and sweat. They will certainly rise up to resist the Soviet revisionist clique.

    苏修集团出卖西伯利亚	魏茂　洪琪
    最近，苏修头目通过意大利的垄断资本组织菲亚特公司，同美帝做成了一笔肮脏交易。由这家公司利用美国提供的贷款和装备，在乌克兰建立一座年产六十万辆小轿车的工厂。
    继这笔交易之后，苏修又通过美国老板的小伙计日本财阀，正在做一笔规模更大的交易，即所谓苏日联合开发西伯利亚的石油、铁砂、铜矿、天然气、森林资源等等。
    战后以来，美国资本全面地渗入了日本的国民经济。日本一系列重要工业部门所输入的新技术，绝大部分来自美国。正是由于美国垄断资本的扶植，日本财阀得以东山再起。因此所谓苏日联合开发西伯利亚，实际上是苏美勾结的一个变种。在苏修头目看来，拉拢日本垄断资本集团搭股入伙，既可掩人耳目，暗中引入美国的资本和技术，又能通过日本垄断资本集团，加紧勾结美帝，联合反华。苏修头目以为通过日本掮客，比起直接交易要隐蔽些，其实这是欲盖弥彰，叛徒的狼子野心，早已尽人皆知。
    为了在西伯利亚主权的大拍卖中招揽顾客，苏修叛徒集团表现出一种异乎寻常的热情。他们在贸易和其他方面向日本财阀提供了罕见的优惠。今年苏联方面没有象过去那样坚持要对日出超，反而同意日本对苏出超一千一百万美元。今年四月又签订了日苏航空协定，同意向日本飞机和人员开放西伯利亚的领空。看！苏修头目为了同美日垄断资本勾结，竟丧心病狂，奴颜婢膝地背着苏联人民，拍卖西伯利亚的神圣主权，堕落到了何等地步！
    日本财阀及其主子美帝国主义对地大物博的西伯利亚早就垂涎已久。美帝国主义企图通过日本把魔爪伸入西伯利亚腹地，攫取大量财富，而且借此想同苏修勾结起来，把西伯利亚变成进攻社会主义中国的侵略基地。
    所谓苏日联合开发西伯利亚的计划，实际上是苏修背着人民出卖西伯利亚的一笔罪恶交易。苏修叛徒在这笔交易中所能得到的，只是美日垄断资本吃剩的一杯残羹，而西伯利亚的大门却向美日垄断资本敞开了。帝国主义的势力就将长驱直入，西伯利亚将沦为美日垄断资本的势力范围。
    苏日“联合开发”西伯利亚的交易，是苏修背叛苏联人民勾结帝国主义的一个抵赖不掉的罪证，是他们反革命修正主义立场的又一次大暴露。
    但是，西伯利亚是属于苏联各族人民的。当年在列宁和斯大林的领导下，为了消灭盘踞在西伯利亚的高尔察克白匪军，为了粉碎从海参崴登陆的日本法西斯的侵略，苏联各族人民的优秀儿女曾经转战在茫茫的风雪中，用自己的鲜血保卫住了西伯利亚。今天，具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联各族人民，决不会允许一小撮叛徒出卖他们用血汗灌溉过的土地，他们一定会起来大造苏修集团的反。
