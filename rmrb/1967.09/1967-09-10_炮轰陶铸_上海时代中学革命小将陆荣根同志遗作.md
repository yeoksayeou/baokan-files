Edition: 3

The editors of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily note: The billion people of our country are now successfully carrying out an unprecedented, large-scale revolutionary criticism movement. This movement has exposed the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist-roaders within the Party to the light of day. The important article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" by Comrade Yao Wenyuan has politically judged the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu, a faithful follower of Chinese Khrushchev. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

"The Bombarding Tao Zhu" is an article compiled by the Southern Daily based on the big-character posters written by revolutionary youngster Lu Ronggen last year to bombard Tao Zhu. The entire text is in the original words. The author uses a large amount of irrefutable material and employs Mao Zedong Thought, the most sharp weapon of struggle, to expose and criticize Tao Zhu's persistent, frenzied opposition to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and to the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. His heinous crimes are laid bare.

Lu Ronggen is a second-year high school student in Shanghai. Like thousands of other revolutionary youngsters, he has a heart full of determination to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to defend the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. He has displayed the great, fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse." He fearlessly faced attacks and criticism, repeatedly exposing Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary words and deeds to Chairman Mao, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the newspapers. Later, he broke through numerous obstacles and came to Beijing, where on November 20 last year, he posted the first batch of big-character posters to bombard Tao Zhu. At that time, Tao Zhu was terrified and hated it to the core. On one hand, he personally organized people to write big-character posters to attack Lu Ronggen, and on the other hand, he instructed the old Shanghai Municipal Committee to investigate Lu Ronggen's materials and carry out political persecution. However, Lu Ronggen was unyielding and continued the struggle. On December 1, he posted the second batch of long big-character posters to bombard Tao Zhu in Beijing. Due to the suppression and persecution of the capitalist reactionary line, Lu Ronggen's body and mind suffered serious damage. On his way back to Shanghai, he fell ill and, despite rescue efforts, passed away on February 12 this year. Lu Ronggen sacrificed his young life to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the earth-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of previously unknown revolutionary youth have courageously taken the stage of politics. They not only dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel, but they are also good at learning, good at thinking, and good at struggling. In the practice of the Cultural Revolution, they have further mastered the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They have combined the fearless revolutionary spirit of rebellion with a strict scientific attitude, and thus, in the great criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they can, like Comrade Lu Ronggen's article "Bombarding Tao Zhu," with a heart full of love for Chairman Mao, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, solidly grasp the key points, strike at the heart, and launch a devastating attack on the bourgeois headquarters.

Revolutionary, brave "little people" defeating reactionary, decayed "big people" is an irresistible law of historical dialectics. Not long ago, the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu, who claimed to be "basically a proletarian revolutionary" and was once a prominent figure, has been thrown into the dustbin of history along with his stubbornly pursued capitalist reactionary line. History has proven that those who play tricks will not have a good ending.

Comrade Lu Ronggen may have left us, but his proletarian revolutionary spirit will forever live in people's hearts. Let us hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and, in the revolutionary criticism, achieve new merits for the people!

Foreword

Lenin teaches us: The victory of Marxism in theory forces its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists. Such is the dialectic of history.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution."

Tao Zhu himself said he does not work for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He complains that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have "mistakes," that the Great Leap Forward is "excessive," and that people should discuss the "errors" of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. He says the socialist system is "grim" and "has no future." He opposes class struggle and promotes the revisionist literary line, doing everything possible to corrupt the youth and make them into successors of the bourgeoisie. Such a person must be bombarded with heavy artillery.

"The Glory of the Sun" is ironclad evidence of Tao Zhu's frenzied opposition to Chairman Mao, the Party, and socialism. It is the first major poisonous weed in the book "Ideals, Morals, and Spiritual Life." This article calls for the nation to discuss, and even for newspapers and magazines to discuss the "errors" of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China.

Tao Zhu said: The broad masses of the people "use 'The East is Red, the Sun Rises' to describe the vigorous spirit of our great cause," "use the sun to praise our great, glorious, and correct Party." But he asks, "Has anyone ever said the sun has no flaws? Although the sun is indispensable for human survival, people still criticize some of the sun's faults. For example, during the hottest days of summer, when the sun is scorching, people will complain that the sun's light and heat are too intense. Moreover, everyone knows and points out that the sun itself has sunspots."

Comparing the leader to the sun can only refer to Chairman Mao. Perhaps Tao Zhu felt it was not clear enough, so he used "The East is Red, the Sun Rises," because everyone knows this song, and the next line is "China has given birth to Mao Zedong." It is clear that Tao Zhu is directing his attack at Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao.

The Chinese people love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China boundlessly and would never complain about Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. This is the truth. Tao Zhu's talk of "flaws" and "the sun's light and heat being too intense" is a vicious attack on Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The Communist Party of China and socialism have the support of 650 million people. The Communist Party of China and socialism are excellent! Tao Zhu boasts that the broad masses should openly discuss the "flaws" and "errors" of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. All this can only show that Tao Zhu is against Chairman Mao, against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Can the broad masses allow him to do this? No! A thousand times no!

Tao Zhu, on the one hand, attacks Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for having "errors," and on the other hand, attacks certain comrades for "not wanting to hear others point out their flaws and errors" and for lacking "the broad-mindedness that a revolutionary must have," and so on.

From his words, we can see that Tao Zhu is attacking Chairman Mao and other Party members who hold high the three red banners. Chairman Mao's revolutionary spirit is the broadest. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and is with the masses. Chairman Mao is also the most humble and best at listening to the masses' opinions. Chairman Mao is the model for the entire Party. The vast majority of Party members have acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Everyone knows that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China are selflessly dedicated.

Tao Zhu's attacks on Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and socialism cannot block the radiant light, but only expose Tao Zhu's true colors.

The Chinese people's resolve to follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party cannot be changed by anyone. All those who oppose Chairman Mao and the Communist Party will not have a good ending!

In the major poisonous weed "On Prospering Creation," Tao Zhu said: "The Party's leadership... is not about leading everything, big and small." "If you want writers to create completely according to your ideas, to have writers modify their work according to your wishes, and even to create a 'theory' that 'I lead the thoughts, and you provide the skills,' how can this not lead to chaotic command? How can it achieve 'a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend'?"

Listen to the words of the rightist element Zhu Anping: "But in the entire country, whether big or small units, even a single department or group, a Party member must be arranged to be the head, and everything, big and small, must be done according to the Party member's wishes, and only then is it considered valid. Is this method too extreme?"

The two people's language is from the same mold, abstractly "affirming" and concretely "denying," both loving to look at faces and hating the Communist Party.

Tao Zhu attacks Party comrades, saying: "Not very familiar with history, not very understanding of life, and not very proficient in literary creation, but still loves to issue orders and commands, wanting others to create according to his ideas. In this situation, it is difficult to create good works." This is the famous high-sounding phrase: "outsiders cannot lead insiders."

Tao Zhu used the black gang member Xia Yan's cross-talk "Guan Yu Fights Qin Qiong" three times to attack the Party's leadership. This cross-talk is about how, before liberation, the family of the Nationalist warlord Han Fuquan invited people to perform. When the actor performed Guan Yu passing through five passes and slaying six generals, Han Fuquan's father said that Guan Yu is from Shanxi and is a subordinate of Yan Xishan and should not be allowed to kill people in the area his son governs in Shandong. The Shandong hero Qin Qiong, his son's subordinate, must defeat Guan Yu. Tao Zhu compares those who execute the Party's literary policy, but are said to "not respect the 'ownership' of creation," "not respect writers," and "interfere too much, give blind commands" to Han Fuquan's father.

Tao Zhu said: "The biggest flaw of these departments (personnel departments) is in their view of non-Party cadres and the serious deviation in the issue of uniting non-Party members. Our view of cadres should be based on both virtue and talent. Cadres must be politically reliable and also have talent, otherwise, what use is a person with no talent at all?"

That Zhu Anping said: "In recent years, many Party members' abilities do not match the positions they hold. They have not done a good job, causing harm to the country, and cannot make people submit, exacerbating the tension in Party-people relations." "This has become a problem that urgently needs to be adjusted in our country's current political life."

One says it is an urgent need for adjustment, one says there is a serious deviation, one says it does not match, and one says talent is needed. Their words are very compatible; they are all of the same ilk.

Tao Zhu said: "Having power but not connecting well with the masses can also make us cultivate bureaucratism. We must be alert to this. Do not let having power produce a sense of privilege." He attacks Party leaders, saying, "not truly treating people as equals, not truly promoting democracy," "always having a bit of 'superiority,'" "looking down on others," "full of airs," "practicing special privileges," "acting arrogantly," "understanding Party policies as very empty things, not reasoning, and still insisting that others submit, how can that be!"

These things are wholesale from the rightists in 1957.

Tao Zhu said: "You can't think that talking about work flaws is opposing the three red banners. Once a hat is put on, no one dares to speak. Where is the enthusiasm of the broad masses? What kind of Party leadership is this?"

This is a duet with the rightists attacking us for "stifling atmosphere, arbitrarily labeling political hats, and no one daring to speak"! No wonder Tao Zhu deleted this passage when he included the article in his book.

Tao Zhu said: "The work we are doing today is not for the Communist Party, of course, not for individuals, but for the people's cause."

Everyone knows that working for the Party and for the people is completely consistent, and the Communist Party and the people are inseparable. Tao Zhu's "individuals" refer to our most beloved Chairman Mao. Tao Zhu opposes Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the people, how vicious! Let's listen to Zhu Anping's words: "I think the Party leading the country does not mean that the country belongs to the Party." From Zhu Anping's words, it can also be heard that individuals refer to Chairman Mao. Let's also listen to the rightist element Qu Beiwei's words: "I strongly doubt whether the power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people or whether all the power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the Communist Party? Does the Communist Party serve the people or do the people serve the Communist Party?" This is the best annotation of Tao Zhu's words.

The major poisonous weed "The Glory of the Sun" was written in 1959, during the Great Leap Forward. The article says: "During the hottest days of summer, when the sun is scorching, people will complain that the sun's light and heat are too intense."

"The hottest days" is a euphemism for the Great Leap Forward. According to Tao Zhu's absurd logic, it is the Great Leap Forward that makes people sweat too much, that makes people too bitter. We can discover that the nouns used in the metaphor itself have strong political connotations. "Some flaws," "the sun's light and heat being too intense," refer to the Great Leap Forward being "excessive." Tao Zhu is indeed bold, openly and shamelessly saying that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have "flaws," that the Great Leap Forward is "excessive," and that the "errors" of the Great Leap Forward should be discussed. Isn't this the tune of the right-opportunists and Deng Tuo? Tao Zhu and they are in cahoots!

Tao Zhu's "The Style of the Pine Tree" also attacks the Great Leap Forward and the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. He compares the Chinese people's sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm during the Great Leap Forward to the "style of the pine tree." The pine tree's style is full of "shattering the body," "never surrendering to harsh environments," "eating grass," "not caring about personal health" (note "how many people"), "working hard," and so on. What strange language, what vicious attacks and slanders! Was the Great Leap Forward a time when the Chinese people lived in harsh environments? Patching together and hinting at things, he has enough seniority.

Tao Zhu also uses the four characters "Heavenly Official Bestows Blessings" on a farmer's wall to say that there are still "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher" from the play "Recruiting Soldiers" in the countryside, attacking the ten-plus years of liberation and the eight years of the people's commune for our ideological work being too poor. He also says that incense burning at the Three Immortals Temple in Guangzhou, with the Sun Yat-sen Hall in front and the Science Museum explaining scientific and revolutionary principles, while the reactionary and superstitious Three Immortals Temple "prevails," to the point of saying this is a "great satire." The great satire is directed at the people? No. It is directed at the enemy. Tao Zhu hates the people so much, where is there any proletarian thought and feeling!

Tao Zhu turns the true socialist system reflected in revolutionary modern plays into "pessimistic, hopeless, grim," a pitch-black mess. Tao Zhu says the socialist system is "hopeless, grim," so the capitalist system must be "hopeful" and "bright," right? Tao Zhu has the face of someone who is determined to walk the capitalist road!

In the major poisonous weed "The Firmness of Revolution," Tao Zhu also spread doubts about the three red banners and socialism. He said: "Indeed, there is a part of people who lack confidence in the socialist revolution and construction, and doubt whether we can quickly build a highly developed socialist society in our country." He said: "Even if they are firmly resisting imperialism and feudalism, they vaguely believe in socialism." This is Tao Zhu's confession of opposing the three red banners and socialism.

In "The Style of the Pine Tree," Tao Zhu again talks about the pine tree's "not being frozen to death," "not being ruined by drought," "not being drowned," "not being blown down," regardless of "severe cold and snow," "intense summer heat," "not knowing what sadness and fear are," "never surrendering to harsh environments." He promotes counter-revolutionary spirit, using this to boost the morale of the rightists.

Tao Zhu tries to incite writers to oppose our regime. He first says that the lack of prosperity in creation is caused by the three years of natural disasters. Immediately, he says that the ancient poet Du Fu wrote more tragic poems and was more sympathetic to the people in times of greater hardship. Then he says, "Our regime is the people's regime, and we cannot incite the people to hate and oppose our own regime." Immediately, he turns around and says that the economy is not prosperous, affected by the three years of natural disasters, and it is difficult to prosper in creation. He talks in such a confused manner, wanting to spit it out but not daring to. When it was included in the book, a large middle section was deleted, truly having ghosts in his heart!

Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." In the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, Chairman Mao issued a call to the people of the whole country: "Never forget class struggle." Chairman Mao also said, "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective."

Tao Zhu said in the book "Thought, Emotion, Literary Talent": "Since the basic completion of the socialist revolution, the private ownership of land in the countryside and the exploiting classes have basically been eliminated."

The socialist revolution has been basically completed? The exploiting classes have been basically eliminated? These are two big questions! According to Tao Zhu's words, we can live in peace.

In the preface to "The Westward Journey" in this book, Tao Zhu actually said that developing production is the center of all problems. He said: "At present, in the period of socialist construction, developing production is the most direct and main interest of the masses." Without a production viewpoint, "it is difficult to clearly and acutely distinguish between beauty and ugliness, good and evil, right and wrong, correct and incorrect, what is allowed and what is not allowed, and it is also difficult to consciously and bravely carry out the Party's policies, and it is easy to be deceived by subjective idealism (in fact, attacking Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle) or influenced by bourgeois ideology to do some stupid or bad things."

Tao Zhu's words were said in December 1, 1960, when class struggle was very sharp. After Chairman Mao emphasized this issue again at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, Tao Zhu, when publishing the book in 1964, made many additions and deletions to other articles, but did not touch this, of course, it was an intentional opposition to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." If we follow Tao Zhu's teachings, it becomes "production struggle, once grasped, is effective." This is a more dangerous tune than "only focusing on grain, cotton, and oil, not on enemies and friends." Everyone knows that the boundaries of beauty and ugliness, good and evil, right and wrong, correct and incorrect, what should and should not be done, can only be distinguished with a class viewpoint. Because the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have completely different views on this. Then why do some comrades do bad things? Why do some people not understand Party policies? Because they have not firmly stood on the proletarian standpoint, have not used the proletarian viewpoint, have relaxed class struggle, and have also done a poor job in production. Don't we all hear examples of this? If we act according to Tao Zhu's words, there will be no way to mess things up. Tao Zhu has pulled everything into developing production, saying that production is the center of all problems. He makes these absurd statements to make the Party and the people forget class struggle, to let the class enemies attack the Party and socialism, to overthrow socialism, and to carry out a capitalist restoration in China!

In the January 1966 edition of "Ideals, Morals, and Spiritual Life," Tao Zhu has this passage: "As for always carrying out movements, it depends on how you understand it. If you carry out movements at every opportunity, it is not good (but denying movements is wrong)." In the April 1962 first edition, the eleven words in the parentheses were not there, but were: "In the future, we should try to carry out fewer movements, but completely denying movements is also inappropriate."

These words are directed at whom? Look at the words before this: "Some teachers have this opinion: 'I am not afraid of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, I am not a counter-revolutionary, I know my own situation; it is the Communist Party that always carries out movements, which is not good. Carrying out movements, ideological criticism, always having to make self-criticisms. The ancient Chinese saying goes: 'A scholar can be killed, but cannot be humiliated.' This way of doing things, I can't stand it, I can't bear it.'"

Tao Zhu raised the black flag of "liberty, equality, fraternity." In socialist New China, shouting "a scholar can be killed, but cannot be humiliated" for what? Isn't this a sign that they oppose the Communist Party? A scholar can be killed—the anti-Communist intellectuals do not want to be led by the Communist Party, preferring to die, also "cannot be humiliated"—the Communist Party should not carry out movements, should not criticize, and let them freely poison the souls of China's next generation and the Chinese people. Since they are not counter-revolutionaries, why are they afraid of movements? Isn't Hu Feng a typical example? This group is very similar. "A scholar can be killed, but cannot be humiliated" is the poisonous gas of hatred towards the Party and socialism. The film "The Peony Pavilion" is full of this poisonous gas. Tao Zhu and this group are in cahoots, shouting with these extreme rightists to carry out fewer movements and so-called "liberty, equality, fraternity," showing what? Tao Zhu is protecting them to pass.

Tao Zhu said: "Always carrying out movements," "carrying out movements at every opportunity," "is not good." In fact, after liberation, it is indeed "always carrying out movements," "carrying out movements at every opportunity." The Party has undergone three major struggles. Our country has carried out land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Antis and Five-Antis, the socialist transformation of the means of production, the Rectification Campaign and Anti-Rightist Campaign, the Great Leap Forward, the General Line, the people's commune, the Socialist Education Movement, and now the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The people of the whole country unanimously shout that it is very good! The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary cadres have exposed one capitalist-roader after another, armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. They have greatly consolidated the Party's leadership and proletarian dictatorship, and have successfully promoted the socialist revolution and construction. We say it is very good, but Tao Zhu says "it is not good," meaning it is very bad. Tao Zhu's opposition to carrying out class struggle has been exposed!

IV

On the literary front, Tao Zhu collaborated with the Zhou Yang group to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. He opposed literature serving proletarian politics and promoted the revisionist literary line.

On March 5, 1962, Tao Zhu's speech at the National Drama and Opera Creation Conference, "On Prospering Creation," is a thorough revisionist literary program. Later, it was included in the book "Thought, Emotion, Literary Talent," with many deletions and changes, totaling dozens of places, two to three thousand words. How can this not arouse suspicion?

At the beginning, he changed "Comrade Tian Han" to "the responsible comrades of the National Drama Federation," "I must talk about some problems related to drama." In the same book, in a speech in December 1957, he said that the reports by Zhou Yang and Lu Dingyi were very important and that everyone should study them carefully. Why did he delete Tian Han's name but not Zhou Yang and Lu Dingyi's names? According to common sense, Tian Han invited Tao Zhu to speak, if the two had an inside connection, there would be no need to delete, because Tao Zhu's speech was accurate and had little to do with the relationship; while saying Zhou Yang and Lu Dingyi's speeches were very important, it showed a certain degree of Tao Zhu's support. This can only show that Tao Zhu has ghosts in his heart. Tao Zhu wants to hide this line, especially the line during the 1962 meeting period. On April 30, 1966, the Yangcheng Evening News had fake criticism materials on Tian Han. Tao Zhu thought that Zhou Yang and Lu Dingyi might not be exposed. But he wants to hide, he can't hide from the Monkey King's fiery eyes.

Chairman Mao pointed out in December 1963: Various art forms—drama, storytelling, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and the socialist transformation in many departments has been ineffective so far. Many departments are still ruled by "dead people." Chairman Mao also said that many communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art, which is strange.

In June 1964, Chairman Mao again pointed out at the rectification of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations: "These associations and the magazines they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have basically (not all) not implemented the Party's policies, acted as officials and lords, not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the edge of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become like the Petofi Club in Hungary on a certain day in the future."

Tao Zhu opposed Chairman Mao's instructions on literary issues. In March 1963, he said in "On Literature Going to the Countryside": "In the past twenty-plus years, our literary and art workers have been doing what Chairman Mao pointed out." On February 20, 1965, Tao Zhu said in a speech: "We are a proletarian dictatorship, and all cultural tools are in our hands."

The book was printed in February 1964, and the words were said in February 1965. Did he not hear Chairman Mao's instructions? Definitely not.

Tao Zhu followed in Zhou Yang's footsteps. Zhou Yang said: "I think our literary and art troops are revolutionary classes, proletarian, not bourgeois." Tao Zhu also said that intellectuals from the old society "many of whom have already become intellectuals of the laboring people," meaning that writers are intellectuals of the laboring people. This is a complete lie. Regarding those in the literary circle who were criticized and struggled against, Zhou Yang said: "They are good comrades." Tao Zhu also said: "Writers demand reasonable political treatment. What's wrong with that? This is a manifestation of many writers' political progress." "Those who meet the standards of a communist can be recruited into the Party. Among them, those who were criticized unfairly in various movements should be corrected in a realistic manner."

Isn't this clearly attacking our Party for not giving writers reasonable treatment and oppressing writers? During this Cultural Revolution, the literary circle has exposed so many ghosts and monsters, some of whom have infiltrated the Party. Tao Zhu still thinks that not enough have infiltrated and wants to pull in another batch. What "changing the original decision" is, is to overturn the rightists' cases. For those who cannot be defended, they should all be pulled into the ranks.

Tao Zhu advocates bourgeois liberalization and opposes literary criticism. He proposes: "First of all, respect the freedom of writers in creation." Later, it was changed to first propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and then divide works into beneficial, harmless, and harmful. In fact, it is opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Tao Zhu raised Mao Zedong's six political criteria and immediately proposed breaking through all frameworks. In fact, it is to break through Mao Zedong's six criteria. Tao Zhu also said that we should prepare a "suitable climate and soil" for "a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend," "form a creation atmosphere suitable for creation." Why? Because literary work has its special nature, literary work leadership is "simple and rough," "arbitrarily labeling political hats." This is closing one's eyes to the facts. From 1959 to 1963, enough weeds were spread, but Tao Zhu still felt it was not enough, seeming to particularly love dirty things. "Simple and rough," "arbitrarily labeling political hats," "not considering special nature," etc., are exactly what Zhou Yang uses to attack revolutionary comrades.

What kind of criticism does Tao Zhu propose? "Write something first, and then let some experts in a small circle have a look." The Party secretary and the people can only give suggestions, and the author has the right not to follow your suggestions. This way, literary criticism is as good as abolished. Literary criticism is a struggle between the two classes and two lines on the literary front. Only by insisting on criticism can we defend Chairman Mao's literary line. Abandoning literary criticism will let bourgeois ideology find a suitable climate and soil. This struggle must be continued.

Tao Zhu does not mention creating for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the whole text does not contain the words "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" or "writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes." The original text only mentions "studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, going deep into life, and blending with workers, peasants, and soldiers" in one sentence, and then says: "Write about what you are familiar with, write about your true feelings," negating the previous sentence. Because the "true feelings" he proposes do not need to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers' true feelings, do not need to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Writing about what you are familiar with is not writing much about workers, peasants, and soldiers. Tao Zhu opposes writers undergoing ideological remolding, talking nonsense about going to factories and villages to "enrich life according to one's needs and strengths." In a speech in March 1963, he said to the performers going to the countryside: "Do not participate too much in physical labor, or do not participate at all, because the performance itself is a kind of labor with considerable intensity." Tao Zhu is against blending with workers and peasants.

Tao Zhu said: "We cannot understand serving politics too narrowly," "the themes of works should be broader." "The Party committee issues a decision, gives an instruction, and immediately writes a script or a novel to serve it, this is not acceptable." Tao Zhu also strongly promoted the three categories of "beneficial, harmless, harmful" works. He opposed literature serving proletarian politics and, with Zhou Yang, promoted the "broad theme theory" and "indirect cooperation theory." This is a reactionary theory that must be thoroughly criticized.

Starting from 1964, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, some literary and art workers engaged in drama reform, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, brought about a great revolution in drama. A large number of revolutionary modern dramas appeared. The socialist and fiery class struggle life was reflected on the stage. The emperors, generals, and talented scholars and beauties, these ghosts and monsters, were driven off the stage. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, took the stage as masters. Tao Zhu, who used to like watching plays, now finds the "taste not so good."

He said: "Some of our plays have bad lyrics, all about 'producing,' 'socialism,' 'how to build socialism,' etc. Ordinary speech is fine, but lyrics should strive to be accurate and beautiful, with thought, emotion, and literary talent." "Some of our plays are not like this, with many slogans and empty concepts."

Those who generally call socialism and other politically charged words "empty concepts, slogans" are the Zhou Yang group. Tao Zhu is in tune with them. Singing about socialism, is that slogan-style? If there are slogan-style words in the play (in fact, at least Tao Zhu and his group forced them on), it is just lacking artistic power, but the political viewpoint is correct. Tao Zhu thinks it is incorrect (not distinguishing the two words). Singing about socialism, of course, has thought and emotion—love for socialism. Saying that socialism has no thought and emotion, isn't that a kind of thought and emotion that opposes socialism? Tao Zhu even frames our ordinary speech: saying socialism is "still okay," of course, it is even more unnecessary to hang on the lips and keep in the mind. Singing about socialism in the play, Tao Zhu opposes even more. Tao Zhu hates and fears socialism so much, what for?

He said: At this time, it is generally not allowed to perform traditional plays, forcing everyone to perform modern plays. The 108 heroes of Liangshan were all forced up, who was willing? Tao Zhu went on to talk about the measures and brutal means taken by rulers of all dynasties in culture, adding a section that we should promote our own claims and thoughts for the interests of the revolutionary class, meaning that it was also brutal. Tao Zhu's words are truly vicious.

Tao Zhu compared Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to "the rulers of the Song Dynasty," compared literary and art workers to the oppressed, and called Chairman Mao's call to perform revolutionary modern plays "forced up the mountain." He said that everyone was unwilling to perform modern plays, no one was willing to take this path, no one was "conscious," but everyone was forced to take the socialist path because they were not allowed to perform ghosts and monsters.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome modern plays. A part of revolutionary literary and art workers are conscious, and they responded to Chairman Mao's call, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. The literary circle has a group of rightists who, whether forced or not, whether stimulated or not, cannot change their nature of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. They want to attempt a rebellion, and we will suppress them resolutely. Now their beautiful dreams are bursting like soap bubbles one by one.

Tao Zhu had another purpose in reprinting "Ideals, Morals, and Spiritual Life" in January 1966: to lead the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" into the trap of pure academic discussion and to cover up for the "Three Family Village."

On page 67, it is indeed interesting: "Someone said: 'Regarding the problem of 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' Yu Pingbo only wrote one article, but you wrote one article after another, why do you criticize Yu Pingbo, who has studied 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' so harshly, making Yu Pingbo almost unable to live?' We also think that Professor Yu Pingbo has studied 'Dream of the Red Chamber'; but his ideological viewpoint is wrong and must be criticized. Of course, this is only a problem of ideological method, a problem of academic debate, a problem within the people. If Professor Yu Pingbo wants to speak again, he can speak; if he wants to publish an article, he can publish it; if he does not agree, he can refute it."

Those bourgeois academic "authorities" thundered, and Tao Zhu rained. In the front, he said there was research and nodded in agreement; in the back, he said the criticism was harsh. Tao Zhu secretly responded: the problem is not big, it is also a problem within the people and can still be refuted. This is truly considerate. This can be said to be a pure academic problem, and similarly, "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" is also like this.

Tao Zhu also listed the affairs of the two counter-revolutionaries Hu Feng and Hu Shi as "ideological method" and "people's internal" problems. Since Tao Zhu published this book with his personal agreement, and he must have known the discussion that was being carried out at that time, if he wanted to correct the mistake, it was still possible. Why insist on going on at this time? Isn't it wearing the same pants as Wu Han!

Tao Zhu said: "Before Hu Feng was exposed as a counter-revolutionary... At that time, we still treated it as a people's internal problem, as an academic debate." "A teacher from Sun Yat-sen University said: 'Hu Shi's point of view is whether it is wrong, we have to wait twenty years to see clearly.' I think it is okay, even if it is thirty years or forty years." "Academic debate is a personal opinion in the field of academic thought."

Hu Feng spread a large number of counter-revolutionary statements before being exposed. Hu Shi is an old anti-communist and anti-people scoundrel. Their thoughts are all anti-communist and anti-people. In Tao Zhu's mouth, they immediately become problems of ideological method and people's internal problems. That Sun Yat-sen University teacher said Hu Shi's viewpoint was not wrong, of course, including anti-communist and anti-people. That teacher wanted to insist on a reactionary position for one or twenty years. Because they all do not work for the Communist Party, so they open their mouths wide, three or four decades can also be. Tao Zhu added a particularly important condition: academic problems are personal small matters, not related to national affairs. Hu Feng and Hu Shi can be treated as pure academic problems, and of course, Wu Han is also a pure academic problem, not worth mobilizing troops, denouncing ghosts and monsters. This way, Tao Zhu's friends can pass. Let ghosts and monsters run wild, won't China change color?

V

Chairman Mao is most concerned about and loves the youth, letting them grow in storms and waves, becoming successors of the proletariat. Tao Zhu does everything possible to corrupt the youth, making them into successors of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said in the "Three Articles": We must establish the "public" spirit, serve the people wholeheartedly, and everyone should take care of national affairs. Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. "Without the correct political viewpoint, it is as if there is no soul." Chairman Mao proposed the policy of "education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor." "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

Tao Zhu, however, desperately wants to establish the "private" spirit, letting the youth and people be confined in personal small circles, not caring about the state and collective, and vigorously promoting the old clichés of personal fame and fortune and not needing ideological remolding.

Recently, everyone knows the story of Cai Yongxiang saving the train, right! But Tao Zhu thinks it is okay not to save it. At the "Ouyang Hai Class" naming meeting on February 5, 1964, he said: "Comrade Ouyang Hai is neither a driver nor a member of the artillery battalion. If he had not gone to save the train, he would not have been responsible, and the leadership would not have criticized him for this." "Such an excellent young man... has the potential to become a general in our army."

According to this logic, Cai Yongxiang also does not need to save the train. If Ouyang Hai keeps thinking about becoming a general, he will not be responsible, will not be criticized, will he go to save it? Will Cai Yongxiang go to save it? Nonsense! This is individualism!

Tao Zhu promotes the revisionist educational line, openly and shamelessly opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

Everyone must establish a proletarian worldview from a young age. Tao Zhu wants to make the next generation not accept proletarian thought, letting bourgeois thought run wild among the next generation. He said: "Establishing a communist worldview. This problem cannot be raised in primary school, it is a bit early in middle school, and it is time to raise this problem in university..."

Chairman Mao said: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and every thought is stamped with the class mark." Tao Zhu sings the opposite: "Youths are different from adults," "youths are relatively pure (pure—1961 edition), although some people (their—1962 edition) come from landlord or bourgeois families," "students from Hong Kong and Macau... most of them are pure, progressive youths." Landlord, bourgeois families, youths from the capitalist world are "pure," right? In "Ideals, Morals, and Spiritual Life," whenever it talks about youths, it always says they are pure. This is a bourgeois rumor company releasing it, why does Tao Zhu also release this gas? It is only to achieve the goal of not changing the youth's thoughts, so as to achieve a peaceful evolution.

Tao Zhu turns Chairman Mao's proposal to study well into studying well in school, advocating that reading is the first priority, saying that politics is not good, but schoolwork can be studied well, at most "not completely." This is an old fossil that only values reading. Participating in a little physical labor and not letting it be too much is called combining with productive labor? Even this little time, he also opposes blending with workers and peasants, going to study the most important productive knowledge to invent and create. Labor is good, only some "encouragement laws." What nonsense? People educated this way cannot serve proletarian politics. According to Tao Zhu's words, university students are of a higher class than laboring people, are "Confucius" (this is a satire on the old education system), all want to become famous and successful, all are free-loving liberalists. This is a white expert road, a dead-end road, and it must not be taken!

After seeing the above, do you think Tao Zhu is a leftist? Can we tolerate him openly opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the Party, and opposing socialism? No! A thousand times no! I say Tao Zhu is an anti-Party, anti-socialism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought element. He must be overthrown!

　　炮轰陶铸
　　——上海时代中学革命小将陆荣根同志遗作
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》编者按：我国亿万人民正在胜利地开展着空前的声势浩大的革命大批判运动。这个运动，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派暴露在光天化日之下了。姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》的重要文章的发表，从政治上对反革命两面派陶铸，这个中国赫鲁晓夫的忠实追随者，作了历史的判决。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    《炮轰陶铸》这篇文章，是《南方日报》根据革命小将陆荣根同志去年炮轰陶铸的几张大字报整理而成的。全文都是原话。作者以大量无可辩驳的材料，运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的战斗武器，一针见血地揭露和批判了陶铸一贯疯狂地反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的滔天罪行。
    陆荣根同志是上海市一个高中二年级学生。他同千百万革命小将一样，怀着誓死保卫毛主席、誓死保卫毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一颗红心，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏革命精神，不怕围攻，不怕打击，向毛主席、中央文革小组和报刊一再揭发陶铸的反革命言行。后来，他又冲破重重阻力，来到北京，于去年十一月二十日贴出了第一批炮轰陶铸的革命大字报。当时，陶铸怕得要死，恨之入骨，一面亲自组织人写大字报对他围攻，一面指使旧上海市委调查他的材料，进行政治迫害。但是，陆荣根同志英勇不屈，坚持斗争，十二月一日在北京又贴出了第二批炮轰陶铸的长篇大字报。由于资产阶级反动路线的压制和迫害，使陆荣根同志的身心遭受了严重损害。在他被迫离京的途中，就病倒了，经抢救无效，于今年二月十二日在上海逝世。陆荣根同志为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，献出了自己年轻的生命。
    在惊天动地的无产阶级文化大革命中，一大批本来不出名的革命青少年，威武雄壮地登上了政治舞台。他们不仅敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反，而且还善于学习、善于思考、善于斗争，在文化大革命的实践中进一步掌握了光焰无际的毛泽东思想。他们把大无畏的革命造反精神和严格的科学态度很好地结合起来，因而在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判中，能够象陆荣根同志《炮轰陶铸》一文那样，怀着一颗热爱毛主席的红心，以毛泽东思想为武器，扎扎实实，抓住中心，击中要害，以摧毁性的火力，向资产阶级司令部发动猛烈的进攻。
    革命的、勇敢的“小人物”战胜反动的、腐朽的“大人物”，这是不可抗拒的历史辩证法。曾几何时，自称“基本上是无产阶级革命家”、风云一时的反革命两面派陶铸，已经连同他顽固推行的资产阶级反动路线一起，被扔进了历史的垃圾箱。事实证明，玩弄阴谋的人，决没有好下场。
    陆荣根同志虽然离开了我们，但是他的无产阶级革命精神，却永远活在人们的心里。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中，为人民立新功！
　　前言
    列宁教导我们：马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者，历史的辩证法就是如此。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    陶铸自己说不替共产党和毛主席做事。他埋怨毛主席和共产党有“过失”，大跃进“过火”，要人们议论毛主席和共产党的“错误”，说社会主义制度“阴森森”、“没前途”。他反对搞阶级斗争，推行修正主义的文艺路线，千方百计地腐蚀青年，使青年去做资产阶级接班人。对于这样的人，必须重炮猛轰。
　　一
    《太阳的光辉》是陶铸猖狂反对毛主席、反党、反社会主义的铁证，是《理想，情操，精神生活》一书里第一号大毒草。这篇文章要全国人民议论，还要在报刊上议论毛主席和中国共产党的“错误”。
    陶铸说：广大人民群众“以‘东方红，太阳升’来形容我们伟大事业的朝气勃勃”，“以太阳来歌颂我们伟大的、光荣的、正确的党”，“但是，又有谁说过太阳毫无缺点呢？尽管太阳是人类生存不可缺少的，但总还是有人批评太阳的某些过失。譬如当大暑天骄阳似火，晒得人们流汗的时候，人们就会埋怨，说太阳的光和热发射得过分了。而且大家都知道并且也都指出过，太阳本身上还有黑点。”
    把领袖比作太阳，只有毛主席。大概陶铸觉得还不够明显，用了“东方红，太阳升”，因为谁都知道这首歌，跟着的一句就是“中国出了个毛泽东”。可以很清楚地看出，陶铸把矛头直接指向毛主席和以毛主席为首的中国共产党。
    中国人民无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱中国共产党，绝对不会埋怨毛主席和中国共产党，这才是事实。陶铸说的“过失”、“光和热发射得过分了”，这是对毛主席和共产党的恶毒攻击。中国共产党和社会主义受到了六亿五千万人民的拥护。中国共产党和社会主义好得很！陶铸扬言要广大人民公开议论毛主席和中国共产党的“过失”、“错误”，这一切只能表明陶铸反毛主席反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，广大人民能允许他这样做吗？不能！一万个不能！
    陶铸一面攻击毛主席、共产党有“错误”，一方面又攻击某些同志“不愿听别人讲自己的缺点和错误”，“缺少一种革命者所必须具有的宽阔胸襟”，等等。
    我们可以从字里行间看见，陶铸攻击的是毛主席和其他高举三面红旗的党员同志。毛主席的革命胸襟是最最宽阔的。毛主席最信任群众，和群众在一起，毛主席也最最谦虚，最善于听群众的意见。毛主席是全党的模范。中国共产党的绝大部分党员都按毛主席的指示做了。谁都心里明白，毛主席和中国共产党是最大公无私的。
    陶铸对毛主席、中国共产党、社会主义的攻击，丝毫挡不住万丈光芒，只能暴露陶铸的本来面目。
    中国人民跟毛主席和共产党走的决心，谁也改变不了。一切反对毛主席和共产党的人，都不会有好下场的！
    在大毒草《对繁荣创作的意见》中，陶铸说：“党的领导……并不是不论什么东西，事无巨细都来领导。”“如果要作家完全按照你的想法去创作，要作家看着你的眼色去修改，甚至创造出‘我领导出思想，你作家出技巧’的‘理论’来，这怎么能不乱指挥？怎么能做到‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’呢？”
    听一听右派分子储安平的话：“但是在全国范围内，不论大小单位，甚至一个科一个组，都要安排一个党员做头儿，事无巨细，都要看党员的颜色行事，都要党员点了头才算数，这样的做法，是不是太过分了一点？”
    两个人的语言是一个模子里造出来的，抽象地“肯定”，具体地否定，都爱看眼色，都恨共产党。
    陶铸攻击党员同志说：“对历史并不很熟悉，对生活并不很理解，对文艺创作也并不那么内行，却偏偏爱乱发号施令，要人家照着他的想法来创作。在这种情况下，要创作出好作品来是有困难的。”这就是有名的高调：“外行不能领导内行”。
    陶铸三次用了黑帮分子夏衍用来攻击党的领导的相声《关公战秦琼》。这个相声说的是解放前，国民党军阀韩复榘的家请人演戏。当演员演到关公过五关斩六将时，韩复榘的父亲说，关公是山西人，是阎锡山的部下，不准到山东他儿子管辖的地方去杀人。山东好汉秦琼，是他儿子的部下，一定要秦琼打败关公。陶铸把那些执行党的文艺方针的，而所谓“不尊重创作的‘所有权’，不尊重作家，干预太多，瞎指挥”的同志，比喻成韩复榘的父亲。
    陶铸说：“这些部门（人事部门）最大的缺点是在对非党干部的看法上，对非党的团结问题上有严重的偏差。我们对干部的看法，要建立在德、才兼备上面。干部当然要政治可靠，也要有才能才行，反之，一点才能也没有，这个人有什么大用呢？”
    那位储安平说：“这几年来，很多党员的才能和他们所担当的职务很不相称。既没有做好工作，使国家受到损害，又不能使人心服，加剧了党群关系的紧张。”“成为目前我国政治生活中急须调整的一个问题。”
    一位要急需调整，一个说有严重偏差，一位说不相称，一个说要才能，话挺投机，都是一丘之貉。
    陶铸说：“有了政权而不很好联系群众，也可以使我们滋长官僚主义。对于这点，我们不能不有所警惕。不要因为有了政权便产生特权思想。”他攻击党的领导同志，“不真正以平等态度待人，不真正发扬民主”，“总是有那么一点‘优越感’”，“高人一等”，“架子十足”，“搞特殊化”，“盛气凌人”，“把党的政策理解为很空洞的东西，又不讲道理，还硬是要人家信服，那怎么能够呢！”
    这些东西是从一九五七年右派分子那里批发下来的。
    陶铸说：“不能人家一谈工作上的缺点就认为是反对三面红旗。帽子一扣，谁也不敢说话了。这还有什么广大人民的积极性呢？这还叫什么党的领导呢？”
    这和右派分子攻击我们“空气沉闷、乱扣政治帽子，大家不敢讲话”唱了一出双簧戏！怪不得陶铸把这篇文章收进书时，把这段话删掉了。
  陶铸说：“今天我们做的事业，不是替共产党做的，当然更不是替个人做的，做的都是人民的事业。”
    大家都明白，为党为人民是完全一致的，共产党和人民是血肉不可分离的。陶铸所谓的“个人”指的就是我们最最敬爱的毛主席。陶铸把毛主席、共产党和人民对立起来，多么恶毒！让我们听一听右派分子储安平的话：“我认为党领导国家并不等于这个国家即为党所有”。从储安平的话里也可以听出个人是指毛主席。再听一听右派分子曲北韦的话：“我十分怀疑，中华人民共和国的权力属于人民呢，还是中华人民共和国的一切权力属于共产党？共产党是为人民服务的呢，还是人民为共产党服务？”这是对陶铸的话的最好的注解。
　　二
    大毒草《太阳的光辉》是一九五九年写的，正是大跃进时期。文章里说：“大暑天骄阳似火，晒得人们流汗的时候，人们就会埋怨，说太阳的光和热发射得过分了。”
      “大暑天”就是大跃进的代名词。按照陶铸的那个混账逻辑，就是大跃进使人们流汗太多，太苦了。我们可以发现，那个比喻上用的名词本身带有强烈的政治性。“某些过失”，“光和热发射得过分了”，指的就是大跃进“过火”。陶铸胆子倒真不小，竟然明目张胆地说毛主席和共产党有“过失”，大跃进“过火”，要议论大跃进的“错误”。这不正是右倾机会主义者和邓拓的论调？陶铸和他们一伙一个鼻孔出气！
    陶铸的《松树的风格》也攻击了大跃进和中国人民的革命朝气。他把中国人民在大跃进时期冲天的革命干劲，都比成“松树的风格”。而其松树的风格充满了“粉身碎骨”，“永不屈服于恶劣环境”，“吃的是草”，“不顾个人的健康”（注意“多少人”）“苦干着”，等等，等等。多么奇妙的语言，多么恶毒的攻击和诽谤！难道在大跃进时期，中国人民就生活在恶劣环境中吗？七拼八凑，指桑骂槐，资格够老的了。
    陶铸还借一个农民家里墙上“天官赐福”四个字，说现在农村还有《抓壮丁》戏里地主李老栓的“天地君亲师”，攻击解放十几年和人民公社八年来我们思想工作太差。他还说广州三元宫烧香，前面中山堂，科学馆讲科学和革命道理，而反动的迷信的三元宫“吃得开”，以致说这是个“极大的讽刺”。极大的讽刺是针对人民的吗？不是。是针对敌人的。陶铸对人民如此恨之入骨，哪有一点无产阶级的思想感情！
    陶铸把革命现代戏里所反映出来的真正的社会主义制度说成是“悲观，没前途，阴森森”，一团漆黑。陶铸说社会主义制度“没前途，阴森森”，资本主义制度岂不是“有前途”、“光明”了吗？陶铸长着的正是一副死心塌地走资本主义道路的面孔！
    在大毒草《革命的坚定性》中，陶铸还散播了对三面红旗和社会主义的怀疑。他说：“确实有一部分人，他们对社会主义革命和建设缺乏信心，对能不能在我们这样一个国家里尽快地建成高度发达的社会主义社会表示怀疑。这主要是表现在对总路线、大跃进与人民公社的看法上。”又说：“哪怕他是坚决反抗过帝国主义、封建主义的，也模糊地有点相信社会主义”。这是陶铸反对三面红旗和社会主义的供状。
    在《松树的风格》中，陶铸又大谈松树的“冻不死”，“旱不坏”，“淹不没”，“吹不倒”，不管“严寒霜雪”、“盛夏烈日”，“不知道什么叫做忧郁和畏惧”，“永不屈服于恶劣环境”。宣扬反革命气节，借此给右派分子打气。
    陶铸企图鼓动作家反对我们的政权，他先说创作不繁荣是三年自然灾害造成的。马上又说古代杜甫在越苦时越悲愤，越同情人民，越能写出文章来。随后就说，“我们的政权是人民的政权，我们不能鼓动人民起来憎恨和反对我们自己的政权。”马上又反过来说经济不繁荣，受三年自然灾害，创作繁荣很困难。就这样颠三倒四，欲吐又不吐。收进书时删了中间一大段，真是心中有鬼！
　　三
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中说：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”毛主席在一九六二年党的八届十中全会上，向全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的号召，毛主席还说，“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”
    陶铸在《思想·感情·文采》一书中说：“自从社会主义革命基本完成以后，农村中的土地私有制、剥削阶级，基本上是被消灭了。”
    社会主义革命基本完成了？剥削阶级基本消灭了？这是两个大问题！照陶铸的说法，可以过太平日子了。
    在这本书的《〈西行纪谈〉序言》上，陶铸竟胡说发展生产是一切问题的中心。他说：“目前，在社会主义建设时期，发展生产就是最直接最主要的群众利益。”没有生产观点“就难于明晰地和锐敏地分辨美与丑、善与恶、好与坏、正确与谬误、许可做与不许可做的界限，也就难于自觉地和勇敢地去执行党的方针、政策，也就极容易为主观主义（按：实际上攻击毛主席关于阶级斗争的理论）的思想所蒙蔽，或受到资产阶级思想的影响而做出一些蠢事或坏事来。”
    陶铸的话是一九六○年十二月一日阶级斗争十分尖锐时说的。毛主席在一九六二年八届十中全会上再次着重提出这个问题后，陶铸在一九六四年出书时，对其它文章进行了大量增删，而对此却不动不删，当然是有意对抗毛主席的指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”我们如果按照陶铸的说教，成了“生产斗争，一抓就灵。”这是一种比“只抓粮棉油，不抓敌我友”更危险的调子。谁都知道，美与丑，善与恶，好与坏，正确与错误，应不应该做的界限，只有用阶级观点才能分清。因为无产阶级与资产阶级对此有截然不同的看法。那末为什么有些同志办了坏事呢？为什么有些人不理解党的政策？因为他们没有牢牢地站在无产阶级立场上，没有用无产阶级的观点，放松了阶级斗争，生产也搞不好，难道这种例子大家听到的还少吗？如果照陶铸说法去做，没有不把事情闹坏的。陶铸把一切都拉到发展生产中去了，把生产说成了一切问题的中心。他之所以制造这些荒唐的言论，就是要使党和人民忘掉阶级斗争，让阶级敌人放手向党向社会主义进攻，推翻社会主义，在中国实行资本主义复辟！
    在一九六六年一月出版的《理想，情操，精神生活》一书中，陶铸有这么一段话：“至于说老是搞运动，这要看怎样理解。动不动就是搞运动，当然不好（但是否定运动，这是错误的）。”而在一九六二年四月第一版时，括号内十一个字是没有的，却是：“今后应当尽量少搞运动，但是完全否定运动，也是不妥当的。”
    这些话针对谁说的呢？请看此话的前面：“有些教师有这样的意见：‘肃清反革命斗争我不怕，我又不是反革命分子，我心中有数；就是共产党老是搞运动不好。搞运动，思想批判，老是要检讨。中国古语说：士可杀，不可辱。这样搞，我便吃不消，受不了。’”
    陶铸举起了“自由、平等、博爱”的黑旗。在社会主义的新中国里，大喊大叫“士可杀，不可辱”干什么？这不是标明他们反对共产党？士可杀——反革命知识分子不愿受共产党领导，宁可死，也“不可辱”——共产党不要搞运动，不要批判，让他们自由自在地去毒害中国下一代和中国人民的灵魂。既然不是反革命，为何怕运动？胡风不就是一个典型例子吗？和这一伙相似极了。“士可杀，不可辱”是仇视党和社会主义的毒气，影片《桃花扇》充满了这种毒气。陶铸和他们一伙一个鼻孔出气，和这些极右分子一齐叫嚷少搞运动和所谓“自由、平等、博爱”，说明了什么？陶铸保护他们过关。
    陶铸说：“老是搞运动”、“动不动就是搞运动”、“当然不好”。实际上，解放后，的的确确是“老是搞运动”，“动不动就是搞运动”。党内经历了三次重大的斗争。我国进行了土地改革、镇压反革命、三反五反、生产资料所有制的社会主义改造、整风反右、大跃进、总路线、人民公社化、社会主义教育运动以至这次无产阶级文化大革命。全国人民齐声欢呼好得很！广大工农兵、学生、革命干部揪出了一个个走资本主义道路当权派，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑。大大地巩固了党的领导和无产阶级专政，胜利地推进了社会主义革命和建设。我们说好得很，陶铸却说“当然不好”，意思是糟得很。陶铸反对搞阶级斗争的面目露出来了！
    四
    在文艺战线上，陶铸配合了周扬一伙，向党向社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。他反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，推行修正主义的文艺路线。
    一九六二年三月五日，陶铸在全国话剧歌剧创作会议上的讲话——《对繁荣创作的意见》，就是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义文艺纲领。后来收入《思想·感情·文采》一书中，作了许多删改，达几十处，二、三千字之多。怎么不令人怀疑？
    一开头，就把“田汉同志”改成了“全国剧协的负责同志”，“一定要我谈谈有关戏剧方面的问题。”在同本书里，一九五七年十二月一次讲话里说周扬、陆定一两个人报告很重要，要大家好好学习。为什么把田汉的名字划掉，而没把周扬、陆定一的名字划掉？按照常识来说，田汉请陶铸讲话，如果两人没有内线，不必划掉，因陶铸讲话准确，和其关系不大，理解为一般的请人发言；而说周扬、陆定一讲话很重要，标明了一定程度上陶铸的支持。这只能表明陶铸心中有鬼。陶铸要隐掉这条线，特别是一九六二年开会时期的线。一九六六年四月三十日《羊城晚报》上，有对田汉的假批判材料。陶铸以为大约周扬、陆定一揪不出来。但是他想瞒，瞒不过孙猴子的火眼金睛。
    毛主席一九六三年十二月指出：各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。毛主席还说，许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。
    一九六四年六月，毛主席在全国文联和所属各协会整风时又指出：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”
    陶铸对抗毛主席关于文艺问题的指示。他在一九六三年三月作的《关于文艺下乡》中说：“这二十多年来，我们的文艺工作者，是按照毛主席指出的这个方向去做的”。一九六五年二月二十日，陶铸在一次讲话里说：“我们是无产阶级专政，一切文化工具都掌握在我们手里。”
    书是一九六四年二月印的，话是一九六五年二月说的，会没有听到毛主席指示吗？肯定不会的。
    陶铸沿周扬的脚印走路。周扬说：“我看我们的文艺队伍是革命阶级的，是无产阶级的，不是资产阶级的。”陶铸也说，旧社会来的知识分子“其中有不少人已经是属于劳动人民的知识分子了”，意思是作家是劳动人民的作家。这是十足的谎言。对于文艺界那些受批评、挨斗争的资产阶级分子，周扬说：“他们是好同志。”陶铸也说：“作家要求有合理的政治待遇。这有什么不好呢？这正是许多作家政治上要求进步的表现。”“合乎共产党员标准的，就可以吸收到党内来。他们当中，在历次运动中有批判得不当的，就应当实事求是地改变原来的决定。”
    这不是明明在攻击我们党没有给作家合理待遇，压迫作家吗？这次文化大革命中，文艺界揪出那么些牛鬼蛇神，其中有的是混入党内的。陶铸还嫌混进不够多，还要拉进一批来。什么“改变原来的决定”，就是替右派分子翻案。对于那些实在没法为之辩护者，也一律得拉进队伍之中。
    陶铸提倡资产阶级自由化，反对文艺批评。他提出：“首先，要尊重作家创作上的自由。”后来改成了首先宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想，而又把作品分成有益、无害、有害三种。实际上正是反对毛泽东思想。陶铸把毛主席说的六条政治标准提了一提，马上又提出打破条条框框。其实正是要打破毛主席说的六条标准。陶铸还说要给“百花齐放，百家争鸣”准备一个“适宜的气候和土壤”，“形成一种宜于创作的‘创作气氛’”。为什么呢？因为文艺工作有特殊性，文艺工作的领导“简单粗暴”，“乱扣帽子”。这是闭眼不看事实。一九五九——一九六三年，毒草放得够多了，陶铸还觉得不够，似乎特别爱脏东西。“简单粗暴”、“乱扣政治帽子”、“不顾特殊性”，等等，正是周扬攻击革命同志时惯用的。
    陶铸提出一种什么样的批评呢？“写出东西来，先在小范围内请些专家来看看”。党委书记和人民，提意见只能作参考，作者有不按你的意见办的权利。这样一来，文艺批评等于取消了。文艺批评是两个阶级、两条道路在文艺战线上的斗争。只有坚持批评，才能捍卫毛主席的文艺路线。放弃文艺批评，就会让资产阶级思想找到合适的气候和土壤。这个斗争必须要坚持下去。
    陶铸不提为工农兵创作，全文找不到为工农兵服务，写工农兵英雄人物的字样。原文里只提到“学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，要深入生活，与工农兵打成一片”一句，随后又说：“要写自己所熟悉的东西，写自己真实的感情”，把前面否定掉了。因为他所提出的“自己真实的感情”，就不必写工农兵真实的感情，就不必宣传毛泽东思想。写自己熟悉的东西，就是不多写工农兵。陶铸反对作家进行思想改造，胡说什么到工厂、农村去是为了“根据自己的需要和所长来充实生活”。他在一九六三年三月一次讲话里，对下乡演出人员说：“不要过多地参加体力劳动，或者就不参加也可以，因为演出本身就是一种相当强度的劳动了。”陶铸就是反对和工农结合。
    陶铸说：“不能把为政治服务理解得太狭窄”，“作品的题材要广泛一些”。“党委写一个决定，发一个指示，就马上写个剧本、写篇小说为它服务，这是不行的。”陶铸还大力宣传“有益、无害、有害”三类作品。他反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，而和周扬在一起鼓吹“题材广泛论”与“间接配合论”。这是反动的理论，必须彻底批判。
    从一九六四年开始，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，部分从事戏剧改革工作的文艺工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，让戏剧来了个大革命。大批革命现代戏出现了。社会主义和火热的阶级斗争生活在舞台上得到了反映。帝王将相、才子佳人等牛鬼蛇神被赶下了台。广大用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵上台做了主人。本来很喜欢看戏的陶铸却觉得“味道不大”。
    他说：“我们有些戏的词就不好，尽是什么‘搞生产’，‘搞社会主义’，‘社会主义怎么搞’等等。平常说话还可以，唱词就应该力求准确、优美，要有思想、感情、文采。”“我们有些戏就不是这样，有不少标语口号和空洞的概念。”
    常把社会主义等带有政治性的词一概叫做“空洞的概念、标语口号”的，是周扬一伙。陶铸和他们同音。戏里唱社会主义，难道就是标语口号式？戏里有标语口号式的话（事实上至少是陶铸一伙硬给安上的），只是没有艺术力量，但政治观点是正确的，陶铸却认为不正确（不去分辨两词）。唱社会主义，当然有思想感情——热爱社会主义。说社会主义没有思想感情，不就是有那么一种反对社会主义的思想感情吗？陶铸连我们平常说话都定了框框：说社会主义“还可以”，当然更不用挂在嘴上，记在脑子里。戏里唱社会主义，陶铸更反对。陶铸对社会主义如此恨，如此怕干什么？
    他说：现在舞台上有两种倾向，一是脱离现实，再就是把现实作自然主义的理解。《红灯记》里正面人物衣服“尽是灰的黑的有什么好看？”“《红鸾禧》中的叫化头子，也穿绸的衣服……为什么有些现代戏把劳动人民总是打扮得那么难看呢？”
    乍一看，陶铸真关心劳动人民，衣服穿得差一点，就提意见了，其实是扯蛋！一九六二年三月五日陶铸在全国话剧歌剧创作会议上说的话，才是他内心话。他替大毒草《胆剑篇》里侮辱劳动人民的行为——使劳动人民下跪作辩护。叫化子穿绸衣服，严重脱离了现实，抹煞了阶级差别。在革命现代戏里，劳动人民打扮得并不难看，只是穿了合乎生活的朴素的衣服，这不很好吗？布景化装也是这样，非如此怎么能反映劳动人民的本色，怎么能体现他们的革命精神！解放前铁路工人李玉和家穿灰的黑的不合乎事实吗？不，合乎事实。他的家也应贫苦一些，否则还象穷工人、象革命者吗？……穿好衣服，住好房子，就是美，这是资产阶级的美。现代戏很好地反映了现实。我们做了很多艺术加工和处理，陶铸诬之为“自然主义”。陶铸从有色眼镜看出来，“社会主义制度下的新人物”——工农兵是不美的，陶铸的“耳朵眼睛都不舒畅”。
    陶铸还说：“这个时候一般就是不让演传统戏，逼大家演现代戏。梁山一百零八将都是逼上去的，有哪个是自觉的？”陶铸在下边还大谈其历代统治者在文化上所采取的措施和残暴手段，又加了一段我们为革命阶级利益应该宣传自己的主张、思想，意思是也粗暴了。陶铸的说法真是太恶毒了。
    陶铸把毛主席和共产党比做“宋朝的统治者”，把文艺工作者比做受压迫者，把毛主席演革命现代戏的号召称为“逼上梁山”，而把大家都说成不喜欢现代戏，都不愿意走这条路，没有一个是“自觉的”，都是一个个走投无路，因为不准演牛鬼蛇神，被逼着走社会主义的路。
    广大工农兵欢迎现代戏。一部分革命的文艺工作者是自觉的，他们响应了毛主席的号召，高高地举起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。文艺界有一批右派分子，逼与不逼，刺激与否，都改变不了他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的本性。他们一伙右派分子要妄想翻天，我们就坚决镇压。现在他们的美梦正在一个个地象肥皂泡一样破灭了。
    陶铸在一九六六年一月再版《理想，情操，精神生活》还有一个目的：把对《海瑞罢官》的批判引入纯学术讨论的圈套，为“三家村”打掩护。
    在六十七页上确是妙趣横生：“有人说：‘关于《红楼梦》问题，俞平伯只写一篇文章，你们写了一篇又一篇，为什么你们把对《红楼梦》有研究的俞平伯骂得这样，把俞平伯搞得几乎混不下去？’我们也认为，俞平伯先生对《红楼梦》是有研究的；但他的思想观点是错误的，必须批判的。当然，这只是思想方法问题，是学术思想论争问题，这是人民内部的问题。如果俞平伯先生愿意再讲，他可以讲的，愿意发表文章，他可以发表的，如果他不服，也可以反驳的。”
    那些资产阶级学术“权威”打雷，陶铸就下大雨。前面说有研究，点头称是；后面说骂得厉害。陶铸暗里应声：问题不大，人民内部问题也还可反驳。真太照顾。这可以说纯学术问题，同理可得《海瑞罢官》也是这样。
    陶铸把胡风、胡适这两个反革命分子的事也列入“思想方法”和“人民内部”问题。既然陶铸出版此书是经过本人同意的，而当时正在开展的讨论他一定知道的，如果改正错误还来得及，为什么这时要坚持下去呢？岂非和吴晗穿一条裤子！
    陶铸说：“在还未揭发胡风是反革命以前……这时我们还是作为人民内部问题，作为学术思想问题来对待的。”“中山大学一个教师说：‘胡适的论点是否错误，要等到二十年后才看得清楚。’我认为可以，就是等三十年、四十年也可以。”“学术思想论争，是作为学术思想上个人的意见。”
    胡风在暴露以前就散播了大量反革命言论。胡适是老牌反共反人民的家伙。他们的思想全是反共反人民。在陶铸嘴里一化，马上变为思想方法和人民内部问题。那位中山大学先生说胡适观点不错误，当然包括反共反人民。那位先生要坚持一、二十年反动立场。因为都是不替共产党做事的，所以狮子大开口，三、四十年也可以。陶铸还加了一个特别重要条件：学术问题是个人的小事，不关系到国家大事。胡风、胡适可以作为纯学术问题，吴晗当然也是纯学术问题，不必兴师动众，声讨牛鬼蛇神，这样，陶铸的朋友就过关了。让牛鬼蛇神自由泛滥，中国不就是要变颜色了吗？
    五
    毛主席最关心和爱护青年，让他们在大风大浪中成长，成为无产阶级接班人。陶铸千方百计地腐蚀青年，使青年去做资产阶级接班人。
    毛主席在“老三篇”里要我们大立“公”字，全心全意为人民服务，国家的事应该管，每个人要管。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”毛主席提出了“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。”“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”
    陶铸却拚命要立“私”字，让青年和人们圈在个人小圈子里，不管国家集体，大力宣扬个人成名成家和不要思想改造的陈腔滥调。
    最近大家都知道蔡永祥同志抢救列车的事迹吧！可陶铸却认为不救也可以。他在一九六四年二月五日命名“欧阳海班”会上说：“欧阳海同志既不是驭手，也不是炮兵连的人，要是他没有去抢救，也不会负什么责任，领导上也不会因此批评他。”“象他这样的优秀青年……有可能成为我们部队的将军。”
    照此逻辑，蔡永祥也根本不用去救列车。欧阳海如果老念着当将军，不会负责任，不会受批评，会去救吗？蔡永祥会去救吗？混账话！这是个人主义！
    陶铸推行修正主义教育路线，明目张胆地和毛泽东思想对抗。
    每一个人必须从小就树立无产阶级世界观。陶铸妄想使下一代不去接受无产阶级思想，让资产阶级思想在下一代中间自由泛滥，他说：“树立共产主义的世界观。这在小学不可能提出这个问题，中学也早了一些，到了大学……是提出这个问题的时候了。”
    毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”陶铸唱反调：“青年人与成年人不同”，“青年人是比较单纯的（纯洁的——一九六一年版），尽管有些人（他们的——一九六二年版）家庭是地主阶级或资产阶级的家庭”，“港澳来的学生……他们之中绝大多数都是纯洁的、力求进步的青年人。”地主、资产阶级家庭，资本主义世界出来的青年人“纯洁”得了吗？在《理想，情操，精神生活》里，一说到青年人，总是纯洁的。这种东西是资产阶级谣言公司放出来的，陶铸为什么也放此气？只有为了达到使青年不改造思想，以便实现和平演变。
    陶铸把毛主席提出的学习好变为功课好，鼓吹读书第一位，说政治不好，功课可以学好，至多“不完全”。这是唯有读书高的老古董。参加一点体力劳动，并且不让多，叫做和生产劳动相结合吗？就连这点时间，也反对和工农结合，去专心学最重要的生产知识，以便发明创造。劳动好只是一些“鼓励法”。算什么话？这样教育出来的人不能为无产阶级政治服务。照陶铸的话，大学生是高劳动人民一等的，是“孔夫子”（这恰好是对旧教育制度的讽刺），都是要成名成家，都是讲私人感情的自由主义者。这是一条白专道路，是走向死胡同里的，万万不可走！
    看了上面这些东西，你们觉得陶铸是一个左派吗？我们能容忍他公开地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反党反社会主义吗？不能！一万个不能！我说陶铸是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的分子。必须把他打倒！
