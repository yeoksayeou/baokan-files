	The Shining Plaques of Quotations

	A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, which had been assisting in agricultural work in Guan Zhuang, was about to receive a new mission and leave.

	"The soldiers are leaving," the news spread like wildfire in Guan Zhuang. Soon, the residence of the propaganda team was filled with people, both inside and outside the house. Everyone was reluctant to see their loved ones leave! No one could forget: when the evil winds blew and dark clouds hung over Guan Zhuang, it was the comrades of the propaganda team who brought the precious books and vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought, giving them the strength to resist the evil winds and fight the waves. During the critical moments of the production peak, it was the comrades of the propaganda team who armed the broad masses of commune members with Mao Zedong Thought, "seizing the revolution and promoting production," achieving a bumper harvest in the wheat season and better autumn crop growth than in previous years. When internal conflicts just began among various revolutionary organizations, it was again the comrades of the propaganda team who unified their thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, forming an iron fist to strike at the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Suddenly, a young man approached the leader of the propaganda team, the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Yu Tian Song, and earnestly said, "Old Yu, please leave us a photograph as a keepsake!" Everyone agreed with this request.

	At this moment, the comrades of the propaganda team felt very uneasy. They thought: coming to Guan Zhuang, the path was led by Chairman Mao; the achievements were made by the poor and lower-middle peasants following Chairman Mao's instructions; in Guan Zhuang, people's thoughts changed, and production increased, all due to the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. All the merits should go to Chairman Mao, how could they leave their own photographs, letting the poor and lower-middle peasants remember them! They had only one heart and one sacred duty, which was to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. If they were to leave a keepsake, it should be the most precious one, so that the poor and lower-middle peasants would remember our great leader Chairman Mao for life, with their red hearts forever turned towards the reddest sun in our hearts.

	Yu Tian Song and his two comrades discussed and decided that since Chairman Mao's portraits and precious books had already been distributed to every household, what else could they give? They thought and thought, finally remembering the quotation plaques at their bedside. It was these shining quotation plaques that hung like mirrors on their beds. They looked at them every day, used them every moment, kept their minds clear, and their direction right, with a burning heart and a single-minded dedication to revolution. They decided to use their own hands to make a bedhead quotation plaque for each of the over three hundred households of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	That night, Yu Tian Song and his comrades got busy. The night was very quiet. People who had worked hard during the day had already entered sweet dreams. The small kerosene lamp flickered, casting a dim light. They huddled around the lamp, cutting, pasting, writing, working with great enthusiasm. As the night deepened, sleepiness came, but they remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "The correct ideology of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." They seemed to see these bedhead quotation plaques in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, already transformed into a great force for "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and seemed to hear the footsteps of the poor and lower-middle peasants following Chairman Mao in revolution. Suddenly, sleepiness disappeared, and they continued their work with renewed spirit. The whole night passed without anyone closing their eyes. As soon as it was light, they picked up their hoes and went to the fields as usual.

	The landlord's old woman and some young men all advised them to rest, but Yu Tian Song and his comrades said, "Promoting Mao Zedong Thought, even if it means staying up all night, we will do it! Even if it costs our lives, we will do it!" In this way, they fought for three whole nights and finally rushed to make over three hundred quotation plaques.

	The day of separation, the sun was particularly red. The commune members held the shining plaques of Chairman Mao's quotations, gazing at the golden characters, with tears welling up in their eyes. These over three hundred shining plaques of quotations expressed the boundless loyalty of the people's children in arms to the great leader Chairman Mao, and also expressed the boundless class feelings between the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses.

	The commune members said to Yu Tian Song and his comrades, "You can rest assured and go. Our poor and lower-middle peasants' hearts will forever be with Chairman Mao, and we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

　　金光闪闪的语录牌
    在官庄支农的解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传组，接受新的任务，就要离开了。
      “解放军要走啦。”这消息象长上翅膀，在官庄传开来。不一会，宣传组的住处，屋里屋外挤满了人。大家从心底里舍不得亲人走！谁也不能忘记：当妖风四起，官庄上空飘着一片乌云的时候，是宣传组的同志送来宝书，大力宣传毛泽东思想，给他们增强了顶妖风、战恶浪的力量；在生产大忙的关键时刻，是宣传组的同志用毛泽东思想武装了广大社员群众，“抓革命，促生产”，赢得了麦季大丰收，秋苗长势胜往年；在各革命组织之间“内战”刚起的时候，又是宣传组的同志，用毛泽东思想统一了他们的思想，使他们形成一个铁拳头，对准中国赫鲁晓夫痛击。
    突然，有个小青年凑到宣传组的负责人、学习毛主席著作积极分子于天松跟前，恳切地说：“老于，你们留张像片作纪念吧！”这个要求大家都非常赞成。
    此刻，宣传组的同志心里很不安。他们想：来到官庄，路，是毛主席他老人家领着走的；成绩，是贫下中农按毛主席的指示办事取得的；在官庄，人变思想地增产，是毛泽东思想的无穷威力。一切功劳只能归于毛主席，怎么能留自己的像片，让贫下中农记着自己呢！我们只有一颗心，只有一个崇高职责，就是要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。要留纪念，就要留下最珍贵的纪念，让贫下中农一辈子想着我们伟大领袖毛主席，颗颗红心永远向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳。
    于天松和两个战友一商量，毛主席像每家已经送过了，宝书每家也已经送过了，再送什么好呢？他们想了又想，最后想到自己的床头语录牌。就是这个金光闪闪的语录牌，象面镜子挂在床头。他们天天照，时时用，头脑清，方向明，心里烧着一团火，一个心眼干革命。他们决定，用自己的双手，为三百多户贫下中农每家作一个炕头语录牌。
    这天晚上，于天松和他的战友就忙开了。夜，静极了。忙碌了一天的人们早已进入甜蜜的梦乡。小煤油灯忽闪忽闪，发着微弱的光亮，他们紧凑在灯下，剪呀，贴呀，写呀，干的可带劲。夜深了，睡意袭来，他们想起毛主席的教导：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”他们仿佛看到，这些炕头语录牌送到贫下中农手里，已经变成“抓革命，促生产”的巨大力量，也仿佛听见贫下中农紧跟毛主席干革命的脚步声。顿时，睡意没有了，精神抖擞地继续投入战斗。整整一夜，谁也没合一合眼，天一亮，他们又照例扛起锄头下地了。
    房东老大娘和一些青年小伙子都劝他们休息，于天松和他的战友说：“宣传毛泽东思想，别说打几个通宵，就是拚上命咱也干！”就这样，他们战斗了整整三夜，终于赶制出三百多块语录牌。
    分别的那天，太阳格外红。社员们手捧金光闪闪的毛主席语录牌，注视着上面的金字，泪珠在眼眶里转动。这三百多个金光闪闪的语录牌，表达了人民子弟兵对伟大统帅毛主席无限忠诚的红心，也表达了人民解放军和广大群众之间无限深厚的阶级感情。
    社员们对于天松和他的战友说：“你们放心走吧，我们贫下中农的心永远向着毛主席，一定把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”　（洪而流、兵声）
