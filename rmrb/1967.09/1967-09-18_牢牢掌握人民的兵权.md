Title: Firmly Grasp the People's Military Power

Chairman Mao has taught us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." The historical experience of the proletarian revolution has proven: the people's mountains and rivers are won by the gun, and the people's mountains and rivers are protected by the gun. Without a revolutionary gun, there is nothing for the people.

We deeply understand that in the old society, the landlord bourgeoisie could ride roughshod over the people and act tyrannically because they had counter-revolutionary guns. We, the broad masses of laboring people, suffered oppression and exploitation because we did not have revolutionary guns. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates surrendering the people's military power. In fact, he is not ignorant of the importance of the gun, but rather wants to dismantle the revolutionary ranks, seize our guns, and establish a dictatorship of the landlord bourgeoisie. His intentions are so sinister!

We warn the number one capitalist-roaders within the Party: we are the great People's Liberation Army of China, personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. The landlord bourgeoisie's attempt to seize our guns is more difficult than climbing to the sky. Our oath is: our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but the revolutionary gun cannot be lost. If the landlord bourgeoisie dares to attempt to seize the revolutionary gun, we will smash them to the ground and stomp on them with our feet, making sure they never rise again!

    牢牢掌握人民的兵权
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”无产阶级革命的历史经验已经证明：人民的江山靠枪杆子打，人民的江山靠枪杆子保。没有革命的枪杆子，就没有人民的一切。
    我们深深懂得，在旧社会里，地主资产阶级能够骑在人民头上作威作福，就是仗着他们有反革命的枪杆子，我们广大劳动人民受压迫受剥削，就是因为没有革命的枪杆子。中国赫鲁晓夫主张交出人民的兵权，其实他并不是不懂得枪杆子的重要性，而是要瓦解革命的队伍，夺取我们的枪杆子，建立地主资产阶级专政。其居心多么险恶！
    正告党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，我们是毛主席亲自缔造，林副统帅直接指挥的伟大的中国人民解放军，地主资产阶级想夺取我们的枪杆子，比登天还难。我们的誓言是头可断，血可流，革命的枪杆子不可丢。地主资产阶级妄想夺取革命的枪杆子，我们就要把它打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫它永世不得翻身！
