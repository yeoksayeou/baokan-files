Do not engage in factionalism, do not settle old scores, and make more self-criticisms. Unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary masses of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System have achieved revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, in the past three months, the revolutionary masses of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System have followed the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, launching a broad and deep wave of revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the arts world and their own units. Revolutionary criticism has rapidly promoted revolutionary unity, and revolutionary unity has greatly advanced revolutionary criticism. Their brilliant achievements in carrying out revolutionary criticism and the successes they have achieved in implementing revolutionary unity demonstrate the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and resound with the inspiring victory song of Mao Zedong Thought!

Seek common ground while reserving differences, achieve revolutionary unity

In the course of revolutionary criticism, can revolutionary mass organizations with differing views unite? How can revolutionary unity be consolidated and developed?

The revolutionary mass organizations of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System have extensively discussed the issue of revolutionary unity in the process of revolutionary criticism.

Some comrades in revolutionary mass organizations believe that the differences between themselves and the other side are "major issues of principle" that must be resolved completely before unity can be discussed; otherwise, it would be "compromising" and "opportunism." Some even believe that such unity would be a loss of "principle" and "collusion" with the other side.

Other comrades believe that the differences between revolutionary mass organizations are internal contradictions among the people, contradictions based on the fundamental unity of the people's interests. In the course of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary mass organizations should actively unite to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and further promote revolutionary unity through revolutionary criticism.

In the discussion, everyone, with questions in mind, repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related instructions on the Cultural Revolution, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, most revolutionary cultural warriors unified their thoughts, believing that the latter view and attitude are correct.

Revolutionary cultural warriors pointed out that we must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the direction of the struggle, and first of all, do a good job of revolutionary criticism. This is the "common ground" among revolutionary mass organizations at present, and this is the major issue of principle. In the face of this great historical task of revolutionary criticism, the differences among revolutionary mass organizations can only be minor issues.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System, based on this understanding, united from the beginning in the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Their practice over the past three months has proven that as long as various revolutionary mass organizations, with invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their soul, fight shoulder to shoulder in the course of carrying out revolutionary criticism, they will definitely deepen their mutual understanding and friendship, gradually eliminate existing differences, and firmly advance toward revolutionary unity.

Correctly treat oneself and correctly treat others

Many revolutionary mass organizations of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System have increasingly deeply realized the importance of correctly treating oneself and correctly treating others in the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism and implementing revolutionary unity. Correctly treating oneself means to adopt an attitude of seeking truth from facts, seeing both one's achievements and one's shortcomings and mistakes. If there are shortcomings and mistakes, admit and correct them, and conduct serious self-criticism. Correctly treating others means to see more of others' strengths and achievements. For the shortcomings and mistakes of the other side, one should view them with a historical and developmental perspective. For shortcomings and mistakes that the other side has already overcome, one should not go back to "old accounts" or "pull hair." One should believe that the revolutionary masses of the other side can educate themselves. In one unit, two revolutionary mass organizations originally used loudspeakers to wage "internal warfare" against each other, but after both sides correctly treated themselves, they stopped the "internal warfare" and united to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, focused on the thought reform of people, and the revolutionary criticism, unity, and promotion of production all showed a good situation.

To solve the problem of correctly treating oneself, the revolutionary mass organizations of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System, in the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism and implementing revolutionary unity, launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Revolutionary mass organization leaders should be promoters of revolutionary unity

The practice of revolutionary unity in the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System in the previous stage indicates that the attitude of the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations is a key issue in whether revolutionary unity can be accelerated.

However, in the previous stage, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations did not see or underestimated the great enthusiasm for unity among the revolutionary masses. These comrades were always concerned with their own "small hilltops." They spoke of small-group interests rather than revolutionary fundamental interests; they reflected the opinions of a part of the backward masses rather than the correct views of the advanced masses. These comrades had little proletarian party spirit and were heavily influenced by petty-bourgeois factionalism. Their words and deeds became obstacles to the advancement of revolutionary unity.

More leaders of revolutionary mass organizations have a clear understanding of the great significance of revolutionary criticism and unity. They went deep among the masses to listen carefully to the voices of the masses, using invincible Mao Zedong Thought to enlighten and raise the awareness of the masses, and actively and enthusiastically led the masses to promote revolutionary criticism and unity, achieving good results. Many units' struggle-criticism-unity liaison service groups did just that. They believed, through studying Chairman Mao's works, that the members of the service group did not represent any headquarters or faction, but were entrusted by various revolutionary mass organizations to represent the broad revolutionary masses and work for the development of revolutionary criticism and the promotion of revolutionary unity. They went deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and did in-depth and detailed ideological work among the masses, playing an active role in promoting revolutionary unity in various units.

### 在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来

    不要搞派性　不要算旧账　多作自我批评
    在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来
    中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派在革命大批判中实现了革命大联合
    据新华社十三日讯　最近三个月来，中央直属文艺系统的无产阶级革命派，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及文艺界和本单位的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，掀起了一个广泛而深入的革命大批判的高潮。革命的大批判迅速促进了革命的大联合，革命的大联合又极大地推动了革命的大批判。他们开展革命大批判的辉煌战果和实行革命大联合所获得的成绩，显示了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的强大威力，响彻着光焰无际的毛泽东思想的动人凯歌！
      求大同存小异，实现革命大联合
    在革命的大批判中，相互间存在着分歧的革命群众组织，能不能联合起来？怎样才能不断巩固和发展大联合？
    中央直属文艺系统各革命群众组织，在革命大批判的过程中，都曾就革命的大联合问题进行了广泛的讨论。
    一些革命群众组织的同志认为，自己和对方的分歧是“大是大非”问题，必须弄个“水落石出”，完全解决，才能谈联合，否则就是“抹稀泥”，是“折衷主义”。有的甚至认为，这样的联合就是丧失“原则”、和对方“同流合污”。
    另一些同志则认为，各革命群众组织之间的分歧，是人民内部矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾，在革命大批判中，各革命群众组织应该积极联合起来斗批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并且通过革命的大批判进一步促进革命的大联合。
    在讨论中，大家带着问题反复学习和领会毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作以及有关文化大革命的指示，在毛泽东思想的统帅下，大部分革命文艺战士统一了思想，认为后一种认识和态度是正确的。
    广大革命文艺战士指出，我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握斗争大方向，首先就要搞好革命大批判，这是当前各革命群众组织之间的“大同”，这是最大的是非问题。在革命大批判这一伟大历史任务面前，革命群众组织之间的分歧只能是小是小非。
    中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派就是基于这样的认识，一开始就在批斗党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的战斗中联合了起来。他们三个月来的实践证明，各革命群众组织在开展革命大批判的过程中，只要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为灵魂，并肩战斗，就一定会不断增进相互间的了解和友谊，逐步消除存在的分歧，朝着革命大联合的方向坚定地走下去。
    正确地对待自己，正确地对待别人
    中央直属文艺系统的许多革命群众组织，在进行革命大批判，实行革命大联合的过程中，越来越深刻地认识到正确地对待自己和正确地对待别人的重要性。正确地对待自己，就是要对自己的组织采取一分为二的实事求是的态度，既要看到自己的成绩又要看到自己的缺点、错误，有缺点有错误，就承认就改正，要进行认真的自我批评。正确地对待别人，就是更多地看到人家的优点和成绩。对对方的缺点、错误，要用历史的发展的眼光去看，对人家已经克服了的缺点和错误，不应该再去翻“老账”，揪辫子。应当相信对方的革命群众完全能够自己教育自己。有一个单位的两个革命群众组织，原先都用高音喇叭对着打“内战”，可是在双方都正确地对待了自己之后，就停止了“内战”，从此联合起来狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们大抓毛主席著作学习，大抓人的思想革命化，革命的大批判、大联合和抓革命、促生产都出现一片大好形势。
    为了解决正确对待自己的问题，中央直属文艺系统的各革命群众组织，在进行革命大批判和实行革命大联合的过程中，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。
    革命群众组织负责人要作大联合促进派
    中央直属文艺系统前一阶段革命大联合的实践表明，各革命群众组织的负责人的态度，是能否加速实现革命大联合的一个关键问题。
    但是，在前一阶段，有些革命群众组织的负责人，对于革命群众中蕴藏的要求联合的极大的积极性看不见，或者对于这种积极性估计过低。这些同志念念不忘的，还是自己的小山头。他们讲的是小团体主义的义气，而不是革命的根本利益；他们反映的是一部分落后群众的意见，而不是先进群众的正确看法。这些同志无产阶级党性不多，小资产阶级派性很浓，他们的言行成了推进革命大联合的阻力。
    更多的革命群众组织的负责人对于革命的大批判、大联合的重大意义是有认识的。他们深入到群众中细心倾听群众的呼声，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去启发和提高群众的觉悟，积极热情地领导群众，推动革命的大批判大联合，结果做出了很好的成绩。有许多单位的斗批联络站勤务组同志就是这样做的。他们通过学习毛主席著作，一致认为，勤务组的成员既不代表哪一个总部，也不代表哪一个派别，而是受各革命群众组织的委托，代表广大革命群众，为着开展革命的大批判和促进革命的大联合来工作的。他们深入基层了解情况，向群众做深入细致的思想工作，对促进各单位的革命大联合起了积极作用。
