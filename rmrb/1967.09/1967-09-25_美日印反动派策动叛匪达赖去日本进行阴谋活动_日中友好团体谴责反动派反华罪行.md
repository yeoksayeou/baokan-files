The U.S., Japan, and India reactionaries have orchestrated the visit of the Tibetan rebel Dalai Lama to Japan to engage in conspiracy activities. Japanese pro-China friendship organizations condemn the reactionaries' anti-China crimes.

	New China News Agency, September 24th: According to a report by the Oriental News Agency, the Japan-China Friendship Religious Conference issued a statement on the 20th, strongly condemning the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries colluding with the Indian reactionaries to jointly plot the visit of the Tibetan rebel Dalai Lama to Japan for activities.

	According to the report, the Dalai Lama, at the "invitation" of the reactionary organization "Japanese Buddhist Missionary Association," will arrive in Tokyo on the 25th to attend the opening ceremony of the "Tibet Exhibition" hosted by the Yomiuri Shimbun on the 26th. He will then stay in Japan for a week, conspiring with reactionary scholars in the Buddhist community to engage in anti-China activities.

	The statement from the Japan-China Friendship Religious Conference condemns the recent armed attacks by the Indian reactionary government on the China-Sikkim border and the visit of Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku to Taiwan and various Southeast Asian countries to plot anti-China activities. The statement points out that in such a situation, allowing the Dalai Lama to use the pretext of "Buddhist friendship" to engage in conspiracy activities in Japan is obviously a link in the U.S. imperialism's policy of "containing" China.

	The statement expresses: We will not allow the reactionaries of the U.S., Japan, and India to bring the reactionary element Dalai to Japan to engage in conspiracy activities, attempting to lead the Japanese Buddhist community down the evil path of anti-China sentiment.

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, September 24th: According to a report by the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Sato reactionary government of Japan, in collusion with the U.S. and Indian reactionaries, has plotted for the Tibetan rebel Dalai Lama, who fled to India, to come to Japan on September 25th to engage in conspiracy activities.

	It is revealed that the rebel Dalai was "invited" by the chairman of the "Japanese Buddhist Missionary Association" and former president of Ritsumeikan University, Morikawa Tomonori. However, in reality, it is the Yomiuri Shimbun that bears all the expenses. It is understood that this "Japanese Buddhist Missionary Association" is colluding with the U.S. imperialists, and its funding mainly comes from the United States.

	The Japanese reactionary forces have long planned to bring the rebel leader Dalai to Japan. After Sato's activities in Taiwan, they hurriedly want Dalai to engage in activities in Japan, which is clearly another crime of the Japanese and Indian reactionaries following the U.S. imperialists in their hostility towards China.

　　美日印反动派策动叛匪达赖去日本进行阴谋活动
　　日中友好团体谴责反动派反华罪行
    新华社二十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好宗教者恳谈会二十日发表声明，强烈谴责美日反动派勾结印度反动派，共同策划让中国西藏叛匪达赖喇嘛到日本进行活动。
    据报道，达赖喇嘛应
  “日本佛教传道协会”这个反动团体的“邀请”，将于二十五日抵达东京，出席二十六日由读卖新闻社主办的“西藏地方展览会”的开幕式，然后在日本逗留一星期，同佛教界的反动学者一起策划反华活动。
    日中友好宗教者恳谈会的声明，谴责印度反动政府最近在中国—锡金边境向中国发动武装进攻以及日本首相佐藤荣作“访问”台湾和到东南亚各地策划反华活动。声明指出，在这样的形势下，让达赖喇嘛借口“佛教亲善”到日本进行阴谋活动，显然这是美帝国主义“遏制”中国政策的一个环节。
    声明表示：我们决不允许美、日、印反动派让反动分子达赖来日本进行阴谋活动，妄图把日本佛教界引入反华的邪路上去。
    新华社东京二十四日电　据《读卖新闻》报道，日本佐藤反动政府勾结美印反动派，策划让逃亡到印度的中国西藏叛匪达赖喇嘛，于九月二十五日到日本进行阴谋活动。
    据透露，叛匪达赖是由“日本佛教传道协会”理事长、前龙谷大学校长森川智德出面“邀请”，但是，实际上是由读卖新闻社担负全部费用。据了解，这个“日本佛教传道协会”同美帝有勾结，它的经费来源主要靠美国。
    日本反动势力把叛匪头目达赖叫到日本来，是蓄谋已久的。在佐藤到台湾活动之后，又急忙要达赖到日本活动，十分明显，这是日本和印度反动派追随美帝国主义敌视中国的又一罪行。
