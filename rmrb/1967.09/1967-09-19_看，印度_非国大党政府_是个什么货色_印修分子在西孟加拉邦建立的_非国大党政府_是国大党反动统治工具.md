The so-called "Non-Congress Party Government" in West Bengal, India, since it took office in early March this year, has consistently followed the directives of the Indian National Congress Central Government, playing a counter-revolutionary double game, protecting the interests of imperialism, the landlord class, and the comprador bourgeoisie, deceiving and suppressing the revolutionary masses of workers and peasants, and committing heinous crimes. In just over half a year, the reactionary and ferocious face of this government, which was praised by the traitor Deng as a "Non-Congress People's Government," has been fully exposed.

The Chief Minister is Ajoy Mukherjee, who recently split from the Congress Party and is a member of the Bengal Congress Party, having previously served as the Congress Party Chairman and government minister of this state; the Deputy Chief Minister is Jyoti Basu, a revisionist of the Communist Party of India. In this state government, there are three members of the Communist Party of India and two members of the traitor Deng group serving as ministers.

After the appearance of such a "Non-Congress State Government," the reactionary clique of the Indian National Congress has been boasting about bourgeois "democracy," attempting to use the deceptive role of this state government to ease the increasingly sharpening class contradictions within the country. The traitor Deng group shamelessly claims that this is a "Non-Congress People's Government." Jyoti Basu and other Indian revisionists are determined to turn the West Bengal "Non-Congress Government" into an example of "peaceful transition."

However, the actions of this state government over the past half year have completely exposed the lies of these reactionaries.

The Watchdog of Capitalists

West Bengal is the region where American and British imperialism has the most concentrated capital in India. Important factories, mines, banks, transportation enterprises, tea plantations, and other economic lifelines are all controlled by American and British capitalists and their Indian comprador monopolists. The countryside still suffers from severe feudal exploitation. However, in the "Common Program of the United Front," which serves as the governing platform of the West Bengal government, there is not a single word about striking or limiting foreign imperialism, domestic monopolies, and feudal forces; it only talks about working for the "welfare of the people."

This state government is doing the work of supporting foreign and domestic big capitalists in ruthlessly exploiting and enslaving workers. Due to capitalists continuously firing workers, the workers of West Bengal, unable to endure it any longer, launched a form of demonstration known as the "surrounding movement." From early March to May 1st, workers had already conducted 144 "surrounding movements," surrounding the offices and residences of capitalists, with 500 capitalists being besieged. To suppress the workers' "surrounding movement," the state government has repeatedly dispatched police, released tear gas, and even opened fire on workers to "rescue" capitalists. Deputy Chief Minister and Indian Communist Party revisionist Jyoti Basu even publicly declared that capitalists "have the right to appropriate police protection."

The so-called "working for the welfare of the people" that this state government boasts about is actually serving the interests of imperialism, comprador capitalists, and feudal landlords, acting as their watchdog.

The Executioner of Revolution

When this state government first took office, it hypocritically promised the people that the "United Front Government will not suppress the people's democratic and legitimate struggles" and "will respect and protect basic civil rights."

However, the West Bengal government's bloody suppression of the armed peasant revolution in the Nasalbari region of Darjeeling District has fully exposed the true nature of this "Non-Congress State Government."

Indian revisionists Jyoti Basu and the Minister of Land and Revenue, Harekrishna Konar, both participated in the police suppression of the armed peasant struggle in Nasalbari.

This state government is the executioner of the revolutionary people. Its so-called "protection of basic civil rights" is the protection of the rights of imperialism, monopolies, and feudal landlords.

Making People More Hungry

When the West Bengal government took office, it boasted about solving the food problem as the main measure to "improve people's lives." However, in reality, this "Non-Congress Government" has not solved the food shortage in West Bengal in the half year since it took office; instead, it has become even more severe.

Among the 36 million people in this state, 27 million are starving. Hungry people are forced to engage in struggles to seize grain. Recently, almost every day there are incidents of the masses violently seizing grain shops and grain-carrying trains and trucks.

"Peaceful Transition" is All Lies

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize political power."

The actions of the so-called "Non-Congress State Government" of West Bengal in the half year since it took office prove that the "peaceful transition" advocated by the traitor Deng group and Indian revisionists is all lies.

The working people of West Bengal have seen through the reactionary nature of this so-called "Non-Congress People's Government," recognizing that it is of the same root as the Congress Central Government and that it, like the Congress Government, is a tool for the Indian big landlords and comprador bourgeoisie to implement counter-revolutionary dictatorship over the working people.

### 看，印度“非国大党政府”是个什么货色  印修分子在西孟加拉邦建立的“非国大党政府”是国大党反动统治工具

    看，印度“非国大党政府”是个什么货色
    印修分子在西孟加拉邦建立的“非国大党政府”是国大党反动统治工具
    据新华社十八日讯本社记者报道：印度西孟加拉邦的所谓“非国大党政府”，自今年三月初上台后，一贯秉承印度国大党中央政府的意旨，玩弄反革命两手，保护帝国主义地主阶级和官僚买办资产阶级利益，欺骗和镇压工农革命群众，罪恶昭彰。半年多的时间，这个被叛徒丹吉吹捧为“非国大党的人民政府”的反革命的狰狞面目，已经暴露无遗。
    首席部长是最近从国大党分裂出来的孟加拉大会党人阿·慕克吉，曾当过这个邦的国大党主席和政府部长；副首席部长是印共修正主义分子乔蒂·巴苏。在这个邦政府中，共有三名印共党员和两名叛徒丹吉集团分子充当部长。
    印度国大党反动统治集团，在这种“非国大党邦政府”出现后，大肆吹嘘资产阶级“民主”，企图利用这种邦政府的欺骗作用，来缓和国内日益激化的阶级矛盾。叛徒丹吉集团跟着厚颜无耻地说，这是“非国大党的人民政府”。乔蒂·巴苏等印度修正主义分子一心要把西孟加拉邦“非国大党政府”搞成和平过渡的“榜样”。
    但是，这个邦政府上台半年多来的所作所为，完全戳穿了这些反动家伙的谎言。	  资本家的看家狗
    西孟加拉邦是美英帝国主义在印度的资本最集中的地区，重要的工厂、矿山、银行、交通运输企业、茶园等经济命脉，都控制在美英资本家和他们的代理人印度买办垄断资本家手中。农村中依然存在着严重的封建剥削制度。但是，在作为西孟加拉邦政府施政纲领的“联合阵线共同纲领”中，却没有一个字提到要打击或限制外国帝国主义、本国垄断资本和封建势力，只是空谈要“为人民福利而工作”。
    这个邦政府干的是支持外国和本国大资本家残酷剥削和奴役工人。由于资本家不断解雇工人，西孟加拉邦的工人忍无可忍，展开了一种叫做“包围运动”的示威活动。从三月初开始到五月一日，工人已先后举行了一百四十四起“包围运动”，包围资本家的办事处和住宅，被围困过的资本家达到五百人。为了镇压工人的“包围运动”，邦政府曾多次出动警察，施放催泪弹并且开枪镇压工人，“营救”资本家、副首席部长、印共修正主义分子乔蒂·巴苏，甚至公然叫嚣，资本家“有权得到适当的警察保护”。
    这个邦政府所吹嘘的“为人民福利而工作”，就是为帝国主义、官僚买办资本家、封建地主的利益效劳，做它们的看家狗。
  镇压革命的刽子手
    这个邦政府刚上台时，曾假惺惺地向人民许下诺言，说什么“联合阵线政府将不会镇压人民的民主和正当的斗争”，“将尊重和保护基本民权。”
    但是，西孟加拉邦政府对大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区农民革命武装的血腥镇压，集中地暴露了这个“非国大党邦政府”的真面目。
    印度修正主义分子乔蒂·巴苏和土地和税收部长哈雷·里希勒·科纳，都参与了警察镇压纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争的活动。
    这个邦政府是镇压革命人民的刽子手。它所谓的“保护基本民权”就是保护帝国主义、垄断资本和封建地主的权利。	  使人民更加饥饿
    西孟加拉邦政府上台时，曾吹嘘要把解决粮食问题作为“改善人民生活”的主要措施。但是，实际上，这个“非国大党政府”上台半年来，西孟加拉邦的粮荒非但没有解决，反而更加严重了。
    在这个邦的三千六百万人中，有两千七百万人挨饿。饥饿的人民被迫开展抢粮斗争。最近几乎每天都发生群众暴力抢粮店和运粮火车、卡车的事件。“和平过渡”全是鬼话
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    西孟加拉邦所谓“非国大党邦政府”上台半年来的所作所为证明，叛徒丹吉集团和印度修正主义分子极力鼓吹的“和平过渡”完全是骗人的鬼话。
    西孟加拉邦的劳动人民已经看透了这个所谓的“非国大党的人民政府”的反动本质，认识到它和国大党中央政府本是同根生，它和国大党政府一样是印度大地主和官僚买办资产阶级手中对劳动人民实行反革命专政的工具。
