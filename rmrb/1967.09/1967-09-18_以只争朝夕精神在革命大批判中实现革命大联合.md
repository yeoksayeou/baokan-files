With the spirit of seizing the day, achieve great unity in the revolutionary criticism
Revolutionary masses across the country seriously study the editorial of "Red Flag" magazine, determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment
Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are determined to unite the broad masses with the greatest political enthusiasm to promote revolutionary great unity

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, after the publication of the editorial "Achieving Revolutionary Great Unity in the High Tide of Revolutionary Criticism" in the 14th issue of "Red Flag" magazine, revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, and revolutionary students across the country have seriously studied and enthusiastically discussed it. They have immediately taken action, with the revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and swiftly achieving revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary criticism. They are fighting to thoroughly smash the clique of capitalism within the party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and to achieve new and more brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat, revolutionary youths, and broad revolutionary masses in the capital have expressed their determination to achieve new victories in realizing revolutionary great unity during the high tide of revolutionary criticism, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao. The responsible comrades of the "East Red Sun Commune" of Beijing Gas and Heat Company, who are actively striving for revolutionary great unity in the entire company, said, "Revolutionary great unity is in the fundamental interests of the proletariat. We, the working class, have no reason to split into this faction or that faction, allowing the class enemy to muddy the waters, shift the direction of the struggle, and disrupt our class lines. We, the warriors of the 'East Red Sun Commune,' are determined to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and make contributions to revolutionary great unity." Many schools in the capital that have not yet achieved revolutionary great unity are making new efforts to realize it; schools that have already achieved revolutionary great unity are continuing to fight to develop and consolidate it.

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanghai said, "In the current unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has issued new instructions: 'Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions.' This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out the revolutionary criticism well, and develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary criticism."

The Revolutionary Headquarters of the Workers in Jinan, affiliated with the Revolutionary Headquarters of the Workers in Shandong, decided to hold a meeting from the 18th to the 23rd, inviting the responsible comrades of grassroots organizations and key factories and mines to study Chairman Mao's works, Comrade Jiang Qing's speech on September 5, and the editorials of "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily." They will conduct criticism and self-criticism in the spirit of being strict with themselves. Representatives attending the revolutionary criticism work conference in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, immediately called their revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations after hearing the broadcast of the "Red Flag" magazine editorial, urging them to immediately organize the study of this important document, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and contribute to swiftly achieving and consolidating revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary warriors of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Shanxi Province said at a meeting: "Whether or not to achieve revolutionary great unity is an important test of whether our revolutionary factions can overcome the 'self' and use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. We must put Chairman Mao's latest instructions into our minds, dissolve them into our blood, and implement them in action, resolutely executing them without any deviation." Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Mountain and River Machine Tool Casting Factory in Qinghai Province said, "The three revolutionary mass organizations in our factory have always been united and fought together, forming a deep combat friendship in the revolutionary criticism. Based on revolutionary great unity and the 'three-in-one combination,' we established the Revolutionary Committee. With unified leadership, our steps are more coordinated, our strength is greater, and we are pushing the revolutionary criticism into a new high tide." Revolutionary workers of the steelmaking workshop in the Guiyang Steel Plant said, "In achieving revolutionary great unity, we must look forward and not settle old scores. We must engage in more self-criticism so that we can unite the majority and form a mighty revolutionary army."

Revolutionary workers of the proletariat in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei said, "We, the workers, as the main force of the cultural revolution, must set an example in revolutionary criticism and great unity. We must lead by example and influence and mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to form a mighty revolutionary army and launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev." Warriors of "Steel Workers General" in Wuhan said, "There are no fundamental conflicts of interest within the working class. Through revolutionary criticism, we can unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary youths of "New Lake University" said, "The working class is the most advanced class. We must humbly learn from them and sincerely be their students. We will make new contributions in revolutionary criticism and great unity."

The reason why the working class split into two factions is ultimately the result of China's Khrushchev's implementation of the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country believe that this obstacle must be removed to achieve revolutionary great unity. Workers of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Jiangxi Tractor Factory, who have already achieved revolutionary great unity in the criticism, said with deep feelings, "It is in the struggle against the clique of capitalism within the party, headed by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road, and their capitalist reactionary line that we achieved revolutionary great unity. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity." Revolutionary masses and Red Guards in Changchun, Jilin Province, said, "The clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, headed by China's Khrushchev, is our most vicious and dangerous enemy. These bad guys are most afraid of and oppose our unity. We must resolutely expose and smash their plots to sabotage revolutionary great unity, and accelerate the achievement of revolutionary great unity in Jilin Province and Changchun City in the high tide of revolutionary criticism." Warriors of the "Red Second Headquarters" in Xinjiang and the "Red Third Headquarters" in Gansu said, "We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, always expose and smash the plots of the class enemy to sabotage revolutionary great unity; we must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to victory."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, following the instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorial "Achieving Revolutionary Great Unity in the High Tide of Revolutionary Criticism" in the 14th issue of "Red Flag" magazine and the editorial "Achieving New Merits for the People in Revolutionary Great Unity" in the "Liberation Army Daily." They expressed with the greatest determination, the greatest political enthusiasm, and the newest combat posture that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, be models in uniting the broad masses, be advanced elements in promoting revolutionary great unity, and achieve new merits for the people in realizing revolutionary great unity and carrying out revolutionary criticism well.

Cadres and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in factories, rural areas, schools, and organs, and the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, started listening to the broadcasts of these two important editorials one after another this morning. They held discussions, analyzed the situation, talked about their understanding, found problems, clarified the direction, and looked at their tasks. They deeply understood the spirit of the editorials. Cadres and soldiers of the Anshan garrison, who have always firmly supported the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, said excitedly, "At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out the direction for us. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and make new contributions to quickly achieving, consolidating, and developing revolutionary great unity." Many cadres and soldiers of the Wuhan garrison said, "We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be the vanguard of revolutionary criticism in the 'three supports and two militaries' work, and be models in uniting the majority and promoting revolutionary great unity." The Party Committee of the Jilin Military Region and the Changchun garrison proposed three measures to implement the spirit of the editorial. Comrade Han Shuangxi, a representative of the "Four Good" platoon of a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, and many comrades said, "Only great unity based on Mao Zedong Thought is true revolutionary great unity. The essence of petty-bourgeois factionalism is an 'ego.' Our current important task is to propagate Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to the revolutionary masses, help them study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and truly do as Chairman Mao says." Cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the Air Force stationed in Hangzhou unanimously pointed out in their study that they must seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, together with the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, better use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. They must resolutely use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and achieve revolutionary great unity. Many cadres and soldiers of the Qinghai garrison said in connection with their support-left practice that in revolutionary mass organizations, we must firmly support and promote the implementation of actions that conform to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and the requirements of the "three-in-one combination"; we must not support and must help correct actions that go against Mao Zedong Thought, cause splits, and engage in factional struggles. Cadres and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the Tianjin Rubber Factory today, after seriously studying the editorial, immediately formulated a plan of action to further launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism throughout the factory and promote revolutionary great unity.

    把毛主席的最新指示印在脑子里落实在行动上
    以只争朝夕精神在革命大批判中实现革命大联合
    全国各地革命派认真学习《红旗》杂志社论决心紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署解放军指战员决心以最大的政治热情团结广大群众大力促进革命大联合
    据新华社十七日讯　《红旗》杂志第十四期社论《在革命大批判的高潮中，实现革命的大联合》发表后，全国各地无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众认真学习，热烈讨论，并且立即纷纷行动起来，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的伟大战略部署，尽快地在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，为彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命新的更加辉煌的胜利而斗争！
    首都无产阶级革命派、革命小将和广大革命群众纷纷表示，一定要按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在革命大批判高潮中为实现革命的大联合立新功。正在为全公司实现革命大联合积极努力的北京煤气热力公司“东方红公社”负责人说，革命的大联合，是无产阶级的根本利益。我们工人阶级没有任何理由分成这个派那个派，让阶级敌人混水摸鱼，转移斗争大方向，搅乱我们的阶级阵线。我们“东方红公社”战士，决心牢牢掌握斗争大方向，在革命大联合中作出贡献。首都大、中学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，学习和座谈了《红旗》杂志十四期社论。许多尚未实现革命大联合的学校，革命群众组织正在为实现革命大联合作出新的努力；一些已经实现革命大联合的学校，也为发展和巩固革命大联合继续战斗。
    上海无产阶级革命派说，在当前无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，伟大领袖毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这是毛主席对我们无产阶级革命派最大的关怀，我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命的大批判搞得好上加好，在革命大批判中发展和巩固革命的大联合。
    山东革命工人造反总指挥部所属济南总指挥部决定从十八日到二十三日，召集基层组织和重点厂矿革命群众组织负责人开会，认真学习毛主席著作、江青同志九月五日讲话以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》社论，本着严于责己的精神，开展批评和自我批评。正在哈尔滨参加黑龙江省革命大批判工作会议的代表们，听了《红旗》杂志社论广播后，立即打电话给自己所在的革命委员会和革命群众组织，要求他们立即组织学习这一重要的文件，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为在革命大批判中，迅速实现和巩固革命的大联合作出贡献。山西省太原机车车辆工厂革命派战士在座谈会上说：搞不搞革命的大联合，是考验我们革命派能否斗倒“私”字，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级派性的一个重要标志。我们要把毛主席的最新指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，不折不扣坚决执行。青海省山川机床铸造厂革命委员会成员说，我们厂的三个革命群众组织，一直就团结在一起，战斗在一起，在革命的大批判中，结下了深厚的战斗友谊，在革命大联合和“三结合”基础上，成立了革命委员会。有了统一的领导，步调更加一致了，力量更大了，推动革命大批判进入一个新高潮。贵阳钢铁厂炼钢车间的革命工人说，在实现革命的大联合中，我们要向前看，不要算旧账，要多作自我批评，这样才能团结大多数人，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    浙江、湖南、湖北的广大无产阶级革命派工人说，我们工人作为文化大革命的主力军，一定要做革命大批判、大联合的模范，要以身作则，影响和带动广大革命群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。武汉“钢工总”战士说，我们工人阶级内部没有根本的利害冲突，通过革命的大批判，完全可以在毛泽东思想的旗帜下联合起来，团结起来。“新湖大”革命小将说：工人阶级是最先进的阶级，我们要虚心向他们学习，老老实实做工人阶级的小学生，在革命大批判和革命大联合中作出新贡献。
    工人阶级内部所以分裂成两派，追根求源，是中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线遗留下来的恶果。各地无产阶级革命派认为，必须扫除这个障碍，实现革命的大联合。已经在大批判中实现了革命大联合的江西拖拉机厂工人革命造反队指挥部的工人深有体会地说，我们就是在同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其推行的资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，实现了革命的大联合的。我们一定遵循毛主席的指示，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合。吉林省长春市广大革命群众和红卫兵小将说，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是我们无产阶级革命派最凶恶、最危险的敌人，这些坏家伙最害怕、最反对我们联合起来。我们一定要针锋相对地揭露和粉碎这一小撮坏家伙破坏革命大联合的阴谋诡计，在革命大批判的高潮中，加速实现吉林省和长春市的革命的大联合。新疆“红二司”、甘肃“红三司”的战士说，我们要百倍提高革命警惕，随时识破和粉碎阶级敌人破坏革命大联合的阴谋诡计；要努力活学活用毛主席著作，克服小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    据新华社十七日讯　遵照伟大统帅毛主席的指示，战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，在热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十四期社论《在革命大批判的高潮中，实现革命的大联合》和《解放军报》社论《在革命大联合中为人民立新功》的发表时，满怀革命豪情，最坚定地表示：一定以最大的决心，最大的政治热情和最新的战斗姿态，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓做团结广大群众的模范，誓做促进革命大联合的先进分子，誓在实现革命大联合、搞好革命大批判中，为人民创立新功。
    正在工厂、农村、学校、机关执行“三支”“两军”任务的陆海空三军指战员和毛泽东思想宣传队，今天清晨起，一遍又一遍地收听了这两篇重要社论的广播，纷纷举行座谈，摆形势、谈认识、找问题、明方向、看任务，深刻领会社论的精神。始终坚定地支持无产阶级革命派的鞍山驻军指战员激动地说，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席一次又一次地给我们指出了前进的方向。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为尽快实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合做出新的贡献。武汉驻军许多指战员说，我们坚决遵循毛主席的教导，在“三支”“两军”工作中坚决做革命大批判的先锋，做团结大多数，促进革命大联合的模范。吉林省军区、长春驻军部队党委，为了贯彻执行社论精神，还专门提出了三点措施。内蒙古军区某部四好连队代表韩双喜和许多战友说：只有在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合，才是真正的革命大联合。小资产阶级派性的实质是一个“私”字。我们当前的重要任务，就是要向革命群众宣传毛主席的伟大战略部署，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级的派性，真正做到毛主席怎样说，自己就怎样做。驻杭州空军某部指战员在学习中一致指出：我们一定要认真贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，和无产阶级革命派一道，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在头脑里大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，更好地用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，坚决用无产阶级的党性，克服小资产阶级的派性，实现革命大联合。青海驻军许多指战员结合支左实践说，在革命群众组织中，凡是符合毛主席无产阶级革命路线，符合革命的大批判，符合革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”要求的言行，我们就坚决支持，全力促其实现；凡是违背毛泽东思想，闹分裂，搞派别斗争的言行，我们就不支持，就要帮助他们纠正。天津驻军进驻天津市乳胶厂的毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们今天在认真学习社论后，当即制定了更深入地在全厂掀起革命大批判的高潮，促进革命大联合的行动计划。
