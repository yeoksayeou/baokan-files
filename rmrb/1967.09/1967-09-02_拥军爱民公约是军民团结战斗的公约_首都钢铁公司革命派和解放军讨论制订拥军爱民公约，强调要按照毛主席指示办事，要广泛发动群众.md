The People's Liberation Army stationed at the Capital Steel Company and the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary mass organizations of the company have enthusiastically responded to the great call of Chairman Mao to "love the military and the people." In recent days, they have been earnestly discussing and drafting a military-loving and people-loving pact. They said: The military-loving and people-loving pact must be drafted on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, on the basis of mobilizing the masses widely and fully discussing and brewing it, so that every clause in the pact is truly imprinted in the minds of the revolutionary masses and implemented in their actions.

In the recent discussions, the soldiers and officers of the support-left troops and the revolutionary masses unanimously agreed that loving the military and the people is a strategic slogan for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and the revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's great call must be fully discussed and deeply understood in all its aspects. Only on this basis can the military-loving and people-loving pact drafted become a pact for military-civilian unity, a battle pact, and a pact to promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve greater victories.

In the process of discussing and drafting the military-loving and people-loving pact, the proletarian revolutionary factions of this company and the soldiers and officers supporting the left in the company reviewed the situation of the Cultural Revolution in this company and the achievements and shortcomings of the work of the People's Liberation Army supporting the left. Both sides, with boundless loyalty, love, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, and with confidence in the victory of the Cultural Revolution, sincerely proposed criticisms and suggestions.

The side of the People's Liberation Army supporting the left in the factory demanded that they follow Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, wholeheartedly support the proletarian revolutionary factions, humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions. They welcomed the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of cadres to criticize and point out the shortcomings in the past work of supporting the left, and resolutely correct them.

The representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations of the Capital Steel Company unanimously agreed: The People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao is the most reliable pillar of the proletarian revolutionary factions. They enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army for its firm and clear stance in supporting the left. Especially when the People's Liberation Army entered the company, they vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, propagated Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, propagated the policies of the Party, and organized everyone to study the works of Chairman Mao. They expressed that the first clause of the military-loving pact is to learn from the People's Liberation Army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to arm one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, to break down private interests and establish public interests, and to temper oneself to serve the people wholeheartedly like the People's Liberation Army.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of this company and the People's Liberation Army supporting the left in the factory believe that the military-loving and people-loving pact must be drafted on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought to be well drafted. Therefore, they decided to first study the "Three Articles" and relevant documents on the Cultural Revolution, hold various meetings, listen to opinions and suggestions, and both sides carry out self-criticism, and then jointly discuss and draft the military-loving and people-loving pact, so that the pact is truly known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

　　拥军爱民公约是军民团结战斗的公约
　　首都钢铁公司革命派和解放军讨论制订拥军爱民公约，强调要按照毛主席指示办事，要广泛发动群众
    据新华社一日讯　驻首都钢铁公司支左的人民解放军和这个公司的无产阶级革命派、革命群众组织，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，最近几天，正在认真酝酿讨论制订拥军爱民公约。他们说：拥军爱民公约，一定要在毛泽东思想基础上，在广泛发动群众，充分酝酿讨论的基础上制订出来，使公约中每一条真正印在革命群众的脑子里，落实在革命群众的行动中。
    在最近几天的讨论中，支左部队指战员和革命群众一致认为，拥军爱民，是推进无产阶级文化大革命的战略口号，是正确处理无产阶级文化大革命中军队和革命群众关系的总原则。对毛主席这一伟大号召，一定要充分讨论，全面地深刻地理解。在这个基础上，制定出来的拥军爱民公约，才能成为军民团结的公约，战斗的公约，促进无产阶级文化大革命取得更大胜利的公约。
    在酝酿讨论制订拥军爱民公约的过程中，这个公司的无产阶级革命派同驻公司支左的指战员，一起回顾了这个公司文化大革命的情况和解放军支左工作的成绩和缺点，双方都怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，无限热爱，无限崇拜的心情，和对文化大革命必胜的信心，诚恳地提出批评和建议。
    驻厂支左解放军方面要求自己做到紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟中央文革小组，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派，虚心向无产阶级革命派学习，过去支左工作中出现的缺点，欢迎无产阶级革命派和广大群众、干部批评指出，坚决改正。
    首都钢铁公司的革命群众组织代表一致认为：毛主席派来的解放军，是无产阶级革命派最可靠的柱石。他们热情地赞扬解放军支左立场坚定，旗帜鲜明。特别是解放军一进公司就大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，宣传党的政策，组织大家学习毛主席著作。他们表示，拥军公约的第一条，就是要象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，破私立公，把自己锻炼得象解放军一样全心全意为人民服务。
    这个公司的无产阶级革命派和驻厂支左解放军认为，拥军爱民公约，一定要在毛泽东思想基础上制订才能订好。因此决定首先学习“老三篇”和有关文化大革命的文件，举行各种会议，听取意见和建议，双方都展开自我批评之后，共同讨论制订拥军爱民公约，使公约真正家喻户晓，深入人心。
