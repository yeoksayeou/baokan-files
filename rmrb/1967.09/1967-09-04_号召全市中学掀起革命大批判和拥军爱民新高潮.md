The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison Military Training Command held a site visit at No. 23 Middle School, calling for a new wave of revolutionary criticism and support for the military among all middle schools in the city.

The meeting pointed out that revolutionary teachers and students should learn well from the People's Liberation Army, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow the course set by Chairman Mao, and carry out thorough revolutionary criticism. This is the greatest way to support the military. The soldiers executing the military training mission should also learn from the revolutionary teachers and students, further help them politically, and together carry out thorough revolutionary criticism. This is the greatest way to serve the people.

New China News Agency, September 3rd: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison Military Political Training Command held a site visit at No. 23 Middle School in Beijing on September 1st, where No. 23 Middle School shared their experiences in revolutionary criticism. The meeting called on the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards of all middle schools in the capital to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and further launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism and support for the military, becoming models of revolutionary criticism and support for the military.

The meeting emphasized that the People's Liberation Army units executing military political training tasks in the capital's middle schools have achieved great results. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital's middle schools has continuously achieved new victories. Currently, it is particularly important to resolutely and enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and serve the people," combining the revolutionary criticism movement with the "support the military and serve the people" movement. Revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards should learn well from the People's Liberation Army, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly follow the course set by Chairman Mao, and carry out thorough revolutionary criticism. This is the greatest way to support the military. Soldiers executing military political training tasks should also learn from revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards, further help them politically, and together carry out thorough revolutionary criticism. This is the greatest way to serve the people.

Members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Zhou Jingfang and Ding Guoyu, attended the site visit and spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "support the military and serve the people," which we must resolutely respond to and immediately carry out. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Without the great People's Liberation Army of China, we would not be able to carry out this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. The People's Liberation Army has achieved great results in the "three supports, two militaries" work. We should pay tribute to them and learn from them! All schools and revolutionary mass organizations must establish "support the military" pacts and do a good job of supporting the military. They hope that middle school revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards will study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to carry out revolutionary criticism. They require that school leaders and revolutionary mass organization leaders focus all their energy on revolutionary criticism. As long as the leadership is determined to grasp revolutionary criticism, mobilize the masses, and do a good job of political and ideological education for the masses, revolutionary criticism will definitely be carried out better. They hope that middle school revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards will be determined to overcome petty-bourgeois thinking, achieve revolutionary great unity with leftists as the core, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the revolution while resuming classes.

Deputy Commander Li Zhongqi of the Beijing Garrison also spoke at the meeting. He said that the revolutionary teachers and students of No. 23 Middle School have vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism and achieved good results. He hopes that all middle schools in the city will learn from them and carry out revolutionary criticism even better. He particularly emphasized that to carry out revolutionary criticism, one must not be disturbed and must resolutely stop armed struggles. He pointed out that although armed struggles are few and individual, they are highly disruptive and destructive, and we must resolutely oppose and stop them. He said that as long as we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, we can carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of No. 23 Middle School introduced at the meeting the experiences of the broad revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards in their school, who raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and became revolutionary critics in the revolutionary criticism. Representatives from the third year of junior high and senior high classes also made typical speeches.

They introduced that in the current complex class struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we, regardless of wind and waves, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, eliminated various disturbances, and insisted on the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle at China's Khrushchev. In the process of criticism, various ideologies from society continuously invaded us. Some people in society mistakenly proposed to engage in large-scale linkage, and some students in the school could not sit still and did not want to "think more." They saw that some schools were in fierce "internal wars," even engaging in armed struggles, and thought that No. 23 Middle School was a "paradise on earth," doubting whether the direction of the struggle was wrong. We timely grasped these active thoughts, organized everyone to study the relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," making revolutionary teachers and students realize that firmly grasping revolutionary criticism, the direction is correct. Recognizing this issue, the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school enhanced their fighting spirit and pushed revolutionary criticism to a new stage.

They deeply felt in their introduction of experiences that revolutionary struggle teaches us that to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the masses, fully carry forward the spirit of revolutionary youngsters who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to revolutionize, and dare to rebel, and fight a people's war. This is the key to carrying out revolutionary criticism. Some people once doubted whether middle school students with low levels could carry out good criticism. However, we firmly believe in the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can all become critics, and middle school students can also carry out good criticism. The revolutionary youngsters of Class 2, Grade 3, in the process of criticism, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can the war be waged, only by relying on the masses can the war be waged." They thought, why can workers and peasants write articles criticizing the bourgeoisie? The key is that they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and participate in the criticism with deep class feelings. An article, a big-character poster, is a cannon shot at China's Khrushchev. Once the youngsters recognized the power of the people's war, they studied materials day and night, discussed issues, rushed to write big-character posters, and carried out criticism. In a few days, big-character posters filled the school, and a people's war was launched. The youngsters, with the problems in the criticism, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, greatly enhancing their fighting spirit and criticism level.

After a period of criticism, teachers and students felt that the front was too long, the target was not concentrated, the firepower was not strong, the criticism was not accurate or fierce, and the criticism was not deep or thorough. The students of Class 2, Grade 1, with this problem, studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Concentrate superior forces, annihilate the enemy one by one." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, they adopted the method of thematic criticism, focusing on one issue, organizing investigations and visits, collecting materials, everyone participating, analyzing and criticizing, immediately achieving relatively good results. Practice has proven that as long as we continuously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, revolutionary youngsters not only dare to charge and fight but also can carry out thorough revolutionary criticism and continuously improve the quality of criticism.

They introduced that fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers is an important condition for carrying out good criticism. The school revolutionary committee and the PLA firmly acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, daringly used revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers, actively created conditions for them, enthusiastically helped them to revolutionize, and for relatively good cadres, we daringly combined and used them, absorbing them into various levels of leadership. The vast majority of teachers also fought with students in their classes, playing an active role in promoting the school's criticism movement, and at the same time promoting the revolutionization of the teaching staff.

They also emphasized introducing the experience of raising high the banner of "supporting the military and serving the people" in the criticism, believing in and relying on the PLA, and learning from the PLA. They said that the PLA comrades studied Chairman Mao's works well and used them flexibly, setting an example for us revolutionary teachers and students. Under the help and influence of the PLA comrades, the school's criticism movement developed with the deepening of the study of Chairman Mao's works, launching wave after wave. In the revolutionary criticism, the PLA comrades and us together criticized verbally and in writing, fighting on the front line of criticism, fiercely attacking the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, playing a significant role in improving the quality of criticism. Experience has proven that to carry out good revolutionary criticism, we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and serve the people," firmly believe in, learn from, support, and rely on the People's Liberation Army.

They also said that revolutionary criticism has strongly consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Due to the firm grasp of criticism, "internal wars" were stopped, and unity was strengthened. Revolutionary criticism also promoted the proletarian revolutionary faction to better grasp and use power. Through criticism, we deeply felt that the newly established school revolutionary committee must have a clear banner, follow Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great strategic deployment, always stand at the forefront of criticism, directing the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Only in this way can we grasp and use power well.

The PLA representative executing the military political training task at No. 23 Middle School also spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to always listen to Chairman Mao's words, humbly be the students of revolutionary teachers and students, resolutely complete the glorious military political training task, and fight shoulder to shoulder with revolutionary teachers and students to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

On September 1st, the schoolyard of No. 23 Middle School was filled with big-character posters for revolutionary criticism, and the entire school became a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. In the afternoon, representatives from various schools participating in the site visit attended the criticism meetings in various classes. The revolutionary teachers and students of this school held criticism meetings and study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works in nine places. More than fifty students, teachers, and PLA soldiers executing military political training in this school spoke, deeply exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev against the party and socialism.

The responsible person of the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of the capital's middle schools, Li Dongmin, also participated in the site visit. On September 1st, the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of the capital's middle schools issued an appeal to all middle schools in the city, calling on middle school revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards to learn from No. 23 Middle School and further launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism and support for the military.

　　北京市革命委员会和北京卫戍区军训指挥部在二十三中召开现场会
　　号召全市中学掀起革命大批判和拥军爱民新高潮
    会议指出，革命师生要很好地向解放军学习，活学活用毛主席著作，沿着毛主席指引的航向前进，搞好革命的大批判，这就是最大的拥军。执行军训任务的指战员，也要向革命师生学习，进一步从政治思想上帮助他们，和他们一起搞好革命的大批判，这就是最大的爱民。
    新华社三日讯　北京市革命委员会和人民解放军北京卫戍区军政训练指挥部，九月一日在北京二十三中召开北京市中学革命大批判现场会，由北京二十三中介绍了革命大批判的经验。会议号召首都中等学校的广大革命师生和红卫兵小将，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步掀起革命大批判和“拥军爱民”的新高潮，做革命大批判的模范，做“拥军爱民”的模范。
    会议强调指出，在首都中等学校执行军政训练任务的中国人民解放军各部队做出了很大的成绩。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在解放军的帮助下，首都中等学校的无产阶级文化大革命运动不断取得新的胜利。当前，特别要最坚决最热烈地响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，把开展革命大批判运动和“拥军爱民”运动结合起来。广大革命师生和红卫兵小将，要很好地向解放军学习，活学活用毛主席著作，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的航向前进，搞好革命的大批判，这就是最大的“拥军”。执行军政训练任务的解放军指战员，也要向革命师生和红卫兵小将学习，并进一步从政治思想上帮助他们，和他们一起搞好革命的大批判，这就是最大的“爱民”。
    北京市革命委员会常委周景方、丁国钰参加了现场会，并在会上讲了话。
    他们指出，伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出了“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，我们应该坚决响应，立即执行。毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”没有伟大的中国人民解放军，我们就不可能进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。中国人民解放军在“三支”、“两军”工作中做出了很大成绩，我们应该向他们致敬，向他们学习！各学校各革命群众组织都要订立“拥军”公约，做好“拥军”工作。他们希望中学革命师生和红卫兵小将活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想搞好革命大批判。他们要求各学校的领导和革命群众组织负责人要把全部精力放在革命大批判上，只要领导下决心抓好革命大批判，放手发动群众，做好群众的政治思想教育工作，革命大批判就一定能够搞得更好。他们希望中学革命师生和红卫兵小将要下定决心克服小资产阶级思想，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，实现以左派为核心的革命大联合，搞好复课闹革命。
    北京卫戍区副司令员李钟奇也在会上讲了话。他说，北京二十三中革命师生生气勃勃地搞革命大批判，作出了很好的成绩，希望全市中学向他们学习，把中学的革命大批判搞得好上加好。他特别强调说，要搞好革命大批判，就要不受干扰，坚决制止武斗。他指出，武斗虽然是少数的和个别的事件，但干扰性很大，破坏性很大，我们必须坚决反对，坚决制止。他说，只要我们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，搞好革命大批判、革命大联合和革命“三结合”，我们就能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    北京二十三中革命委员会代表在会上介绍了他们学校广大革命师生和红卫兵小将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命大批判中人人争当革命批判家的经验。初三和高中各班级的代表还分别作了典型发言。
    他们介绍说，在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的复杂的阶级斗争中，我们不管风吹浪打，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，排除种种干扰，坚持了斗争大方向，把斗争矛头直指中国赫鲁晓夫。在大批判的过程中，社会上的各种思潮不断侵袭我们。社会上有人错误地提出要搞大串连，校内一些同学便坐不下来，不愿“多思”。他们看到有的学校“内战”激烈，甚至发生武斗，就认为二十三中是“世外桃源”，怀疑斗争大方向是否错了。我们及时抓住这些活思想，组织大家学习《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关社论，使革命师生认识到，狠抓革命大批判，大方向就是正确的。认清了这个问题，全校革命师生增强了斗志，把革命大批判推向一个新阶段。
    他们在介绍经验中深有体会地说，革命斗争教育我们，要想紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，必须认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想发动群众，充分发扬革命小将敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的精神，打好一场人民战争，这是搞好革命大批判的关键。有人曾经怀疑中学生水平低，能不能搞好大批判。但是我们坚信毛泽东思想威力无穷，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人都可以当批判家，中学生同样可以搞好大批判。初三（二）班革命小将在大批判中学习了毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们想工人农民为什么能写文章批判资产阶级呢？关键在于他们毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，带着深厚的阶级感情参加大批判。一篇文章、一张大字报，就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一发炮弹，小将们一旦认识了人民战争的威力后，就夜以继日地研究材料，讨论问题，赶写大字报，进行大批判，不到几天，大字报便贴满了校园，一场人民战争打响了。小将们带着大批判中的问题活学活用毛主席著作，大大提高了斗志和批判水平。
    大批判进行一段时期以后，师生们又感到战线太长，目标不集中，火力不猛，打得不准、不狠，批得不深、不透。高一（二）班的同学带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”。根据毛主席的教导，他们采用专题批判的方法，抓住一个问题，组织调查访问，收集材料，人人动手，分析批判，马上收到了比较好的效果。实践证明：只要不断地活学活用毛主席著作，革命小将不但善于横刀策马，能冲能闯，而且也能扎扎实实地开展革命的大批判，并不断提高批判质量。
    他们介绍说，充分调动革命干部和革命教师的积极性是搞好大批判的一个重要条件。校革委会和解放军坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，大胆使用革命干部和革命教师，积极为他们创造条件，热情帮助他们起来革命，对于比较好的干部，我们大胆结合，放手使用，吸收他们参加各级领导班子。绝大多数教师也在班上和学生一起战斗，对推动全校的大批判运动起了积极作用，同时促进了教师队伍的革命化。
    他们还着重介绍了在大批判中高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，相信和依靠解放军，向解放军学习的经验。他们说，解放军同志对毛主席著作，学得好，用得活，为我们革命师生作出了榜样。在解放军同志的帮助和带动下，学校的大批判运动随着学习毛主席著作运动的深入发展，掀起了一个又一个高潮。在革命大批判中，解放军同志们和我们一起口诛笔伐，“杀”上大批判的第一线，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，对提高批判的质量起了很大的作用。经验证明，要搞好革命的大批判，就要坚决响应毛主席提出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决相信、学习、拥护、依靠人民解放军。
    他们还说，革命的大批判，有力地巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。由于狠抓了大批判，就制止了“内战”，加强了团结。革命的大批判，也促进了无产阶级革命派进一步掌好权、用好权。通过大批判，我们深深体会到：刚刚建立起来的校革命委员会，必须旗帜鲜明，紧跟毛主席和党中央的伟大战略部署，永远站在大批判的最前列，把斗争的矛头指向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，只有这样，才能掌好权，用好权。
    在二十三中执行军政训练任务的解放军代表也在会上讲话，表示要永远听毛主席的话，虚心做革命师生的小学生，坚决完成军政训练的光荣任务，并且和革命师生并肩战斗，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    一日，北京二十三中校园里贴满了革命大批判的大字报，整个学校成了革命大批判的战场。下午，参加现场会的各学校代表分别到各班参加了批判会。这个学校的革命师生分别在九个场所举行批判会和活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。五十多名学生、教师和在这个学校执行军政训练的解放军纷纷发言，深刻地揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反党反社会主义的滔天罪行。
    首都中等学校红代会负责人李冬民也参加了现场会。一日首都中等学校红代会向全市中等学校红卫兵发出倡议书，号召中学革命师生和红卫兵小将向二十三中学习，进一步掀起革命大批判和“拥军爱民”的新高潮。
