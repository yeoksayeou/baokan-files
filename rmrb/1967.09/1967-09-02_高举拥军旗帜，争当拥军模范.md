To advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further and achieve even more brilliant victories, all revolutionary factions of the proletariat, all Red Guards, and all revolutionary masses must always "believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army," always love the People's Liberation Army, always learn from the People's Liberation Army, and always support the People's Liberation Army. We must closely unite with the People's Liberation Army. We must extensively and deeply propagate the great significance of Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," making it known to every household and deeply ingrained in people's hearts. We must launch a mass movement of "supporting the army and loving the people," mobilizing the broad revolutionary masses to sign new covenants with the PLA to support the army and love the people, striving to be models of supporting the army, creating a strong atmosphere of supporting the army, and fostering excellent military-civilian relations.

In the "support the army and love the people" movement, we must humbly learn from the PLA. We must learn from their unwavering political direction in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must learn from their fine revolutionary traditions of emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style. We must learn from their proletarian qualities of firm stance, clear distinction between love and hate, being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to oneself, and infinitely loving the people. We must learn from their high revolutionary consciousness and organizational discipline in resolutely implementing the Party's policies and strictly observing the three disciplines and eight points of attention. We must learn from their communist spirit of "seeking no personal gain but dedicating oneself to the people." We must master all the good thoughts, good styles, and good experiences of the PLA.

In the "support the army and love the people" movement, our greatest support for the army is to enthusiastically assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" work. We must actively reflect the situation of the local proletarian cultural revolution to them, create favorable conditions for their work, and actively support all revolutionary measures they take. We must strictly examine our shortcomings and mistakes in supporting the army, practice open and mass self-criticism, and rectify our past shortcomings and mistakes. Regarding the PLA, we can also offer suggestions when necessary, but we must follow Chairman Mao's principles for handling contradictions among the people and adopt appropriate and unity-promoting methods.

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

　　高举拥军旗帜，争当拥军模范
    为着把无产阶级文化大革命更推向前进，取得更辉煌的新胜利，一切无产阶级革命派，一切红卫兵革命小将，一切革命群众，都要永远“相信和依靠人民解放军”，永远热爱人民解放军，永远学习人民解放军，永远拥护人民解放军，同人民解放军更亲密地团结起来。我们一定要广泛深入地宣传毛主席关于“拥军爱民”号召的伟大意义，做到家喻户晓，深入人心，掀起“拥军爱民”的群众运动，发动广大革命人民与解放军共订新的拥军爱民公约，争当拥军模范，把拥军的空气搞得浓浓的，把军民关系搞得好好的。
    在“拥军爱民”运动中，我们要虚心向解放军学习。学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚定正确的政治方向。学习他们突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良革命传统。学习他们立场坚定，爱憎分明，对敌狠，对己和，无限热爱人民的无产阶级品质。学习他们坚决执行党的政策，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意的高度的革命自觉性和组织纪律性。学习他们“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义精神。把解放军的一切好思想、好作风、好经验学到手。
    在“拥军爱民”运动中，我们最大的拥军，就是要满腔热情地协助人民解放军搞好“三支”、“两军”工作，积极向他们反映地方无产阶级文化大革命的情况，为他们的工作创造有利条件，积极支持他们采取的一切革命措施。要严格检查自己在拥军方面的缺点错误，实行公开的、群众性的自我批评，处理自己发生过的缺点和错误。对于解放军，在必要时也可以提意见，但必须按照毛主席的处理人民内部矛盾的原则，采取适当的有利于团结的方式。
