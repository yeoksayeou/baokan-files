The theoretical journal of the Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction), "Revolutionary Warrior," in its 12th issue, published a notice from the Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction) regarding the study of Chairman Mao's great works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

The notice stated that Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," these two brilliant philosophical works, summarize the great Chinese revolution and world revolution in terms of ideology, and are extremely important documents that elevate dialectical materialism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. To study Mao Zedong Thought, one must study these two works.

Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" summarizes the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, applies "On Contradiction" to the reality of socialist society, creatively develops the theory of class and class struggle in socialist society, and enriches the treasury of historical materialism. This work is a programmatic document for the Cultural Revolution that no one has ever undertaken before, and is a great historical document that elevates the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat to a new stage.

The notice said that the Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction) has decided to elevate the study of Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage by launching a movement to deeply study Chairman Mao's works throughout the prefecture, and has decided to open a party school in early September. The study content includes: (1) "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism" as well as the mass line; (2) the theory of the international anti-revisionist struggle centered on "On the General Line of the International Communist Movement"; (3) "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." When studying these three philosophical works, it is necessary to combine them with the study of the second part "Class and Class Struggle," the fourth part "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People," the twenty-second part "Thought Methods and Work Methods," and the thirty-third part "Study" of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

"Revolutionary Warrior" also published three study guides for studying Chairman Mao's three works.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee of Japan decided at a recent board meeting to launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's works under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to advance the Asian-African people's solidarity movement.

    毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部著作总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，把《矛盾论》运用于社会主义社会的现实，创造性地发展了社会主义社会中阶级和阶级斗争的理论，丰富了历史唯物主义的宝库。这部著作是前人从未进行过的文化大革命的纲领性文件，是把无产阶级专政的理论提高到崭新阶段的伟大历史文献。
    通知说，日共山口县委员会（左派）为了把学习毛泽东思想运动提高到更新的阶段，决定在全县范围内开展一个大学毛主席著作的运动，并且决定在九月上旬开办党校。学习内容是：（一）“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》以及群众路线；（二）以《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的论战》为中心的国际反修斗争的理论；（三）《实践论》、《矛盾论》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。在学习这三部哲学著作的时候，需要结合学习《毛主席语录》的第二部分《阶级和阶级斗争》、第四部分《正确处理人民内部矛盾》、第二十二部分《思想方法和工作方法》、第三十三部分《学习》。
    《革命战士》同时刊登了学习毛主席的这三部著作的三篇学习辅导材料。
