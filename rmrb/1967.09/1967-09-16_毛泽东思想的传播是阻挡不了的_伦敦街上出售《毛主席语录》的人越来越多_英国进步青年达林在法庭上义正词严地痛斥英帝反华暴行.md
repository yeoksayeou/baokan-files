	The spread of Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. The number of people selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the streets of London is increasing. British progressive youth Martin Darling sternly denounced the anti-China atrocities of British imperialism in court.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from London dated September 12, the London police, terrified and enraged by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, once again brazenly arrested three British youths and one African youth on the night of September 11 for selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the streets of London. They plan to send them to the so-called "Magistrates' Court" for an unreasonable trial.

	These four youths have been voluntarily selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other revolutionary books published in China every evening for the past month. Their actions have been welcomed by the masses, and the sales volume of the books has rapidly increased.

	In August, the London police had twice arrested progressive individuals selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" outside Hyde Park, which is touted as a "window of democracy." However, the fascist suppression of British imperialism cannot block the spread of truth. Over the past month, every Sunday, more people have come to Hyde Park to sell "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and the number of buyers has also increased.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from London dated September 8, the London authorities once again unreasonably "tried" British progressive youth teacher Martin Darling for selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of Hyde Park. Darling sternly denounced the British imperialists' despicable anti-China actions in court. Due to the absurdity of the charges against Darling, the court was ultimately forced to declare him not guilty. This "trial" once again exposed the ugly face of British imperialism's hatred and fear of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Darling was arrested by the police on August 28 for the second time while selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other Chinese publications in front of Hyde Park. This was the second time in a month that he was arrested by British police for selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	This time, the British police, just like the first time, made absurd accusations against Darling, claiming that he caused "traffic congestion" outside Hyde Park.

	Darling sternly refuted the police's unreasonable accusations in court. He also solemnly declared in court that as a friend of the Chinese people, he strongly protests against the British authorities' hostile actions towards the People's Republic of China.

	Darling's powerful exposure made the judge extremely flustered. He hurriedly interrupted the "trial" and ordered the police to forcibly drag Darling out of the courtroom.

	In the afternoon, when the court resumed the "trial," Darling once again refuted the police's unreasonable accusations. Three witnesses also used their eyewitness accounts to prove that the police's arrest of Darling was completely unjustified.

	Faced with the ironclad facts, the judge and the police had nothing to say. The court ultimately had no choice but to withdraw the charges against Darling and declare him not guilty and released.

    毛泽东思想的传播是阻挡不了的
    伦敦街上出售《毛主席语录》的人越来越多
    英国进步青年达林在法庭上义正词严地痛斥英帝反华暴行
    新华社伦敦十二日电　伦敦警察当局由于对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死、恨得要命，十一日晚上又一次悍然逮捕了在伦敦街上出售《毛主席语录》的三名英国青年和一名非洲青年，并要把他们送到所谓“治安法院”去进行无理审讯。
    这四名青年从一个月以前开始，每天晚间义务出售《毛主席语录》和中国出版的其他革命书籍。他们的行动受到了群众的欢迎，书籍销售量迅速增加。
    八月间，伦敦警察当局曾经两次在被标榜为“民主橱窗”的海德公园外面，逮捕出售《毛主席语录》的进步人士。但是，英帝国主义的法西斯镇压，封锁不住真理的传播。近一个多月来，每逢星期天，反而有更多的人到海德公园去出售《毛主席语录》，买的人也越来越多。
    据新华社伦敦电　英国伦敦当局八日又一次无理“审讯”在海德公园前出售《毛主席语录》的英国进步青年教师马丁·达林。达林在法庭上义正词严地痛斥英帝国主义反华的卑劣行径。由于指控达林的“罪名”十分荒唐，法庭最后被迫宣布达林无罪。这次“审讯”，再次暴露了英帝国主义仇视和害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想的丑恶面目。
    达林是八月二十八日在海德公园前出售《毛主席语录》和其他中国出版物时再次被警察逮捕的。这是他在一个月之内第二次由于出售《毛主席语录》横遭英国警察逮捕。
    英国警察这次逮捕达林时同第一次一样，对他提出了荒唐的指控，说什么他在海德公园外面引起了“交通阻塞”。
    达林在法庭上义正词严地驳斥了警察的无理指控。他还在法庭上庄严声明，作为中国人民的朋友，他对英国当局对中华人民共和国的敌视行为表示强烈抗议。
    达林的有力揭露使法官极为狼狈。他慌慌张张地立刻中断“审讯”，命令警察把达林硬拉出法庭。
    下午开庭“审讯”时，达林再次驳斥了警察对他的无理指控。三个证人也用他们目击的事实证明警察对达林的逮捕是毫无道理的。
    在铁的事实面前，法官和警察无话可说。法庭最后只好撤销对达林的指控，宣布他无罪释放。
