	Editorial

	The revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have charged into the current vigorous mass revolutionary criticism movement. With their own hands that have changed heaven and earth, they have written out their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev.

	They have proven with facts that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest feelings about the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, have the deepest emotions for Chairman Mao, and have the most right to speak in the rural revolutionary criticism.

	They have also proven with facts that the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought can hit the target in revolutionary criticism. Their articles are like sharp swords, striking directly at the heart of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Let us take Dazhai as an example, launch a new high tide of mass revolutionary criticism, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly from political, ideological, and theoretical aspects. We must also take Dazhai as an example, seize the revolution, promote production, and strive for new and greater victories in both revolution and production.

　　编后
　　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大寨大队的革命干部和贫下中农，在当前轰轰烈烈的群众性革命大批判运动中，横刀跃马，杀上阵来。他们用自己改天换地的双手，写出了对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，写出了对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨。
    他们用事实证明，广大贫下中农对农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争感受最深，对毛主席的感情最浓，在农村革命大批判中最有发言权。
    他们还用事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农进行革命大批判，能够击中要害。他们的文章如一把把利剑，直刺中国赫鲁晓夫的心脏。
    让我们以大寨为榜样，掀起一个群众性的革命大批判的新高潮，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭。我们还要以大寨为榜样，抓革命，促生产，争取革命和生产的新的更大的胜利。
