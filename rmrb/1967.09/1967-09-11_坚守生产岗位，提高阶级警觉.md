Just as our Zigong City Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Congress was opening, a battle cry from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao came from Beijing, followed by the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu." This article thoroughly exposed the ugly face of the Khrushchev-style conspirator under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, providing us poor and lower-middle peasants with new weapons for carrying out revolutionary criticism.

We poor and lower-middle peasants in Zigong City, in conjunction with studying this article, reviewed the year's struggle process, which further boosted our morale and heightened our revolutionary vigilance. As early as April and May this year, when the revolutionary masses were launching a full-scale counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line, a handful of malicious elements, in order to disrupt our class line, attempted to incite some peasants who were unaware of the truth to go to the city to engage in armed struggles, attack the revolutionary masses, and shift our direction of struggle. We poor and lower-middle peasants used the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose their ugly true colors, thoroughly foiling their conspiracies. We held fast to our production posts, did a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units, promoted revolutionary great unity, and achieved great victories in both revolution and production.

As the revolutionary criticism became more extensive and profound, and the proletarian revolutionary masses were concentrating their firepower to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, a handful of counter-revolutionaries stirred up another gust of evil wind. They deliberately confused the boundaries between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, directing their spearheads at the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, protecting the bourgeois headquarters, and helping a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road to slip through. These fellows are a bunch of demons that cannot stand the sunlight. They dare not come out in the open but only operate in the dark, sometimes disrupting our direction of struggle from the right, and sometimes appearing in an ultra-"leftist" guise to deceive the masses, instigate armed struggles, create divisions among the revolutionary masses, and disrupt our ranks. Although these fellows are cunning and vicious, as long as we use the class analysis method taught by Chairman Mao, we can see through them and recognize who they really are.

We poor and lower-middle peasants, at this critical moment of class struggle, must resolutely carry out the strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, consolidate the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, strengthen the unity of the revolutionary masses, guard against the sabotage and disruption by Tao Zhu-like figures, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚守生产岗位，提高阶级警觉	四川自贡市农代会
    正当我们自贡市贫下中农代表会议开幕的时候，从北京传来了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，接着又发表了姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》。这篇文章把赫鲁晓夫式阴谋家的丑恶嘴脸，彻底暴露在毛泽东思想的阳光之下，给我们贫下中农提供了进行革命大批判的新的武器。
    我们自贡市贫下中农结合学习这篇文章，回忆了一年的斗争过程，更加鼓舞了斗志，更加提高了革命警惕性。早在今年四、五月，当革命派向资产阶级反动路线全面反击的时候，一小撮别有用心的坏家伙，为了扰乱我们的阶级阵线，企图调动不明真相的一些农民进城搞武斗，围攻革命派，转移我们的斗争大方向。我们贫下中农用毛泽东思想这面照妖镜，照出了他们的丑恶原形，彻底挫败了他们的阴谋诡计。我们坚守生产岗位，搞好本单位的斗批改，促进了革命的大联合，在革命和生产上都取得了巨大的胜利。
    当革命的大批判更加广泛深入地开展，无产阶级革命派正集中火力向中国赫鲁晓夫及党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火时，一小撮反革命分子又刮起了一阵妖风。他们极力混淆无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的界限，把矛头指向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，保护资产阶级司令部，保护一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派蒙混过关。这些家伙是一群见不得阳光的魔鬼。他们不敢公开出面，只是在暗中活动，一会从右的方面来扰乱我们的斗争大方向，一会又以极“左”的面目出现来迷惑群众，挑起武斗，在革命派中间制造分裂，扰乱我们的阵线。这些家伙虽然诡计多端，手段恶毒，但是，只要用毛主席教导我们的阶级分析方法，就能认清他们到底是人还是鬼。
    我们贫下中农在这场阶级斗争的关键时刻，一定要坚决执行毛主席和党中央的战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，加强革命派的团结，严防陶铸式的人物的捣乱和破坏，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
