The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka has lodged a protest with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs against the Sri Lankan government's insistence on colluding with the Chinese People's Public Enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and following the U.S. in deliberately creating "Two Chinas." The embassy warned the Sri Lankan government to halt its actions immediately.

The New China News Agency reported from Colombo on the 14th that the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka sent a note to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on the 13th, expressing strong indignation over the Sri Lankan government's disregard for multiple consultations and protests from the Chinese Embassy. The Sri Lankan government insisted on colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and following the U.S. in deliberately creating "Two Chinas."

The note pointed out that this is a serious provocation by the Sri Lankan government against the Chinese people, a gross interference in China's internal affairs, and a serious step towards worsening relations between the two countries.

The note pointed out that after the Chinese Embassy submitted a protest note to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on August 22 regarding the Sri Lankan government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and cooperation with the U.S. in creating "Two Chinas," six more members of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were recently invited to Sri Lanka to inspect government-sponsored water conservancy projects. Among them was a "government official" from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

The note said that prior to this, the chairman of the Sri Lankan United Newspaper Company, Wickremesinghe, and two members of the United National Party visited Taiwan. The two members even invited the deputy foreign minister of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Yang Xikun, to visit Sri Lanka. In addition, the parliamentary secretaries of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Agriculture and Food and the Ministry of Public Works, Posts and Telecommunications, as well as the secretary of the Sri Lankan Chamber of Commerce, were invited to visit Taiwan.

The note said that the Sri Lankan government, led by the United National Party, has always played a two-faced game, saying one thing and doing another. After receiving the Chinese Embassy's protest note on August 22, you quickly issued a statement saying that the Sri Lankan government's position is that it only recognizes the People's Republic of China. In reality, you continue to closely collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Where do you intend to lead Sino-Sri Lankan relations?

The note once again warned the Sri Lankan government: You must stop immediately, cut off all ties with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and not participate in any activities that create "Two Chinas." If you persist in your delusion and continue your mad anti-China actions, you must bear all the serious consequences that follow.

    我大使馆抗议锡兰政府坚持追随美帝制造“两个中国”
    警告锡兰政府必须悬崖勒马
    新华社科伦坡十四日电中国驻锡兰大使馆十三日照会锡兰国防、外交部，对锡兰政府不顾中国大使馆的多次交涉和抗议，坚持要与中国人民的公敌蒋匪帮勾结，追随美帝，蓄意制造“两个中国”，表示极大的愤慨。中国大使馆奉命再次向锡兰政府提出强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，这是锡兰政府对中国人民的严重挑衅，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是恶化中锡两国关系的严重步骤。
    照会指出，在中国大使馆八月二十二日向锡兰国防、外交部递交了关于锡兰政府与蒋匪帮勾结、配合美帝制造“两个中国”的抗议照会之后，最近又有六名蒋匪帮分子应邀来锡兰，视察官方主办的水利工程，其中还有一名蒋匪帮“政府官员”。
    照会说，在此以前，锡兰联合报业公司董事长威克伦辛格和两名统一国民党议员访问了台湾，该两名议员还竟然邀请蒋匪帮伪外交部次长杨西昆访锡。此外，锡兰农粮部和公共工程邮电部议会秘书以及锡兰商会秘书等应邀将访问台湾等。
    照会说，以统一国民党为首的锡兰政府一贯玩弄反革命的两面手法，说的是一套，做的是另一套。你们在收到中国大使馆八月二十二日抗议照会之后，赶忙发表公告，说锡兰政府的立场是“它只承认中华人民共和国”，实际上你们又继续与蒋匪帮密切勾结。你们这样做，究竟要把中锡关系引向何处？
    照会再一次警告锡兰政府：你们必须悬崖勒马，立即断绝与蒋匪帮的一切联系，不参与任何制造“两个中国”的罪恶活动。如果你们执迷不悟，继续疯狂反华，必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
