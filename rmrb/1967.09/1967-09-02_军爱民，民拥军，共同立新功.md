All revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary groups in Hubei Province and the Wuhan area are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call. We are raising the banner of supporting the army even higher, firmly believing in, supporting, and learning from the People's Liberation Army. Based on the specific situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our locality, we will formulate new military-civilian mutual support agreements. The army loves the people, the people support the army, and the army and people together achieve new victories.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army." Ironclad facts prove that the People's Liberation Army is absolutely trustworthy and reliable.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei and Wuhan is advancing victoriously according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The vast people's war of criticizing Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei and Wuhan is unfolding. The proletarian revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The situation demands that we cherish the blood-bonded, fish-in-water relationship between the army and the people as we would our own eyes. We must be a thousand times more vigilant against the class enemy's attempts to sow discord, fish in troubled waters, and sabotage military-civilian unity. All proletarian revolutionary masses, all revolutionary Red Guards, all revolutionary groups, and the People's Liberation Army must unite more closely and fight together.

The proletarian revolutionary masses should actively and extensively propagate the strategic significance of Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people." In the great criticism, we should enhance the combat friendship between the army and the people and actively assist the army in carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work.

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

　　军爱民，民拥军，共同立新功
    我们湖北全省、武汉地区一切无产阶级革命派、一切革命的红卫兵、一切革命群众，最最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，更高地举起拥军的旗帜，坚定不移地相信解放军，拥护解放军，支持解放军，最诚恳地向解放军学习。根据本地无产阶级文化大革命运动的具体情况，制定好新的拥军爱民公约。军爱民，民拥军，军民共同立新功。
    毛主席教导我们，要“相信和依靠人民解放军”。铁的事实证明：人民解放军是绝对可以相信和依靠的。
    湖北、武汉的无产阶级文化大革命正按照毛主席的伟大战略部署胜利前进。对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北、武汉的代理人进行革命大批判的波澜壮阔的人民战争正在展开。无产阶级革命派正在联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。
    形势要求我们要象爱护自己眼珠一样地爱护血肉相连、鱼水相亲的军民关系。我们要千百倍地警惕阶级敌人挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，破坏军民团结。一切无产阶级革命派、一切革命红卫兵、一切革命群众和人民解放军要更加紧密地团结起来，共同战斗。
    无产阶级革命派要积极地广泛深入地宣传毛主席发出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召的战略意义，在革命大批判中增进军民的战斗友谊，主动协助解放军搞好“三支”“两军”工作。
