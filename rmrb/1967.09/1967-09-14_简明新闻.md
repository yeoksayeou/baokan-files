		Algeria Protests U.S. Fleet's Violation of Its Territorial Waters

		On September 11, the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Swiss chargé d'affaires in Algeria, who represents U.S. interests, and handed him a note from the Algerian government to the U.S. government, strongly protesting the intrusion of the U.S. Sixth Fleet into Algerian territorial waters.

		At 3:40 a.m. on September 7, a supply ship, three minesweepers, and several submarines of the U.S. Sixth Fleet intruded from the sea east of Algiers into a place seven nautical miles off the Algerian coast. When Algerian warships discovered the U.S. warships had intruded into Algerian territorial waters and immediately went to intercept them, these U.S. pirate ships immediately turned around and fled to the high seas.

		Egyptian Forces Continue to Strike Israeli Aggressors

		The Egyptian Armed Forces General Command announced in a battle report issued in Cairo on September 12 that Egyptian forces had shot down an invading Israeli warplane that day, destroyed five half-tracked vehicles, three military vehicles, and an observation post of Israel, and blew up an ammunition depot.

		The battle report said that two Israeli warplanes had intruded into Egyptian airspace near Kantara City, about 40 kilometers south of Suez, that morning. Egyptian forces shot down one of the enemy planes with anti-aircraft artillery and forced the other to flee back to the Israeli-occupied area east of the Suez Canal.
