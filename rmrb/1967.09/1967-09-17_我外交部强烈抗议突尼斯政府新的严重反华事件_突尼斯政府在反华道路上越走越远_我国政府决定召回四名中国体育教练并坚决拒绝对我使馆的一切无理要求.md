Tunisian government is going further and further down the anti-China path
Chinese government decides to recall four Chinese sports coaches and firmly rejects all unreasonable demands on our embassy

	BEIJING, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Embassy in Tunis handed over a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, dated September 14, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Tunisian government on September 15. The note strongly protested the Tunisian President's defamation of China and the great leader of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, as well as the Tunisian government's illegal detention of Chinese table tennis coaches and embassy personnel, and unreasonable restrictions on the normal activities of Chinese embassy personnel, among other serious anti-China incidents. The note sternly pointed out that the Chinese government "has decided to immediately recall the four Chinese sports coaches who were sent to help Tunisia develop its sports industry, and at the same time firmly reject all unreasonable restrictions and demands by the Tunisian authorities that discriminate against the Chinese Embassy."

	The note said that Hua Zhengde, a Chinese table tennis coach invited by the Tunisian government, was accompanied by Zhang Jiaxiang, a member of the Chinese Embassy, to Bizerte for a routine coaching activity on July 14 this year. The Bizerte Police Bureau illegally detained Hua Zhengde and Zhang Jiaxiang. The Chinese Embassy had previously made oral representations and protests to the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this incident. The Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs not only did not admit its mistake but also refused to acknowledge its responsibility for guaranteeing the personal safety of Chinese Embassy personnel and Chinese coaches. Instead, it openly discriminated against the Chinese Embassy and arbitrarily demanded that embassy personnel, starting from August 1, must obtain approval from the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs before traveling to regions outside Tunis Province. Moreover, there have been continuous serious incidents of unreasonable harassment and obstruction of Chinese Embassy personnel conducting normal activities.

	The note said: "What is even more outrageous is that President Bourguiba personally jumped out on August 23 to engage in anti-China rhetoric, defaming the Chinese people and the great leader of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao Zedong, to an extreme degree."

	The note said: "The undeniable facts prove that the Tunisian government has taken new, serious anti-China steps in a planned and continuous manner. For this, the Chinese government has made a strong protest to the Tunisian government."

	The note pointed out that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tunisia, the Chinese side has consistently actively sought to develop friendly relations between the two peoples. However, the Tunisian government has repeatedly engaged in activities to sabotage the friendly relations between the two peoples, including participating in the conspiracy by U.S. imperialism to perpetually occupy China's Taiwan Province to create the "two Chinas" plot, which has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs and violated China's sovereignty. Regarding the normal activities and diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy, the Tunisian government, disregarding international customs, has arbitrarily interfered with and discriminated against it, such as prohibiting the issuance of news bulletins, obstructing the holding of film screenings, and detaining mail sent to the embassy, etc. As for the Tunisian government's direct and through its reactionary newspapers' malicious defamation and shameless slander of China, it has become increasingly severe.

	The note emphasized: "The Tunisian government, disregarding the warnings from the Chinese side, has persisted in its course and gone further and further down the anti-China path. This is something that the peoples of China and Tunisia cannot tolerate."

	The note said: "The Tunisian government's anti-China activities have intensified at this time, which is not accidental. The Tunisian people and the peoples of the Arab countries have once again proven in their struggle against U.S., British, and Israeli aggression and Soviet revisionist betrayal that the Chinese people are their most reliable friends, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for liberation. Especially Chairman Mao's great call to 'unite all the peoples of the world, defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs' and his brilliant exposition on achieving final victory through people's revolutionary war are being used by the Tunisian people and the peoples of the Arab countries as the most powerful weapon to arm themselves. U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are terrified by this, launching a new wave of anti-China sentiment, attempting to extinguish the Tunisian people's and the peoples of the Arab countries' anger against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The Tunisian government, standing on the side of U.S. imperialism, is splitting and disintegrating the anti-imperialist front of the Arab people, thereby arousing the extreme anger and resolute opposition of the Tunisian people and the peoples of the Arab countries. The Tunisian government's days are getting worse. Now, the Tunisian government is even trying to use anti-China sentiment to divert the attention of the Tunisian people and to cover up its crimes of further aligning with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and betraying the interests of the Tunisian people and the peoples of the Arab countries, which will not end well."

    我外交部强烈抗议突尼斯政府新的严重反华事件
    突尼斯政府在反华道路上越走越远
    我国政府决定召回四名中国体育教练并坚决拒绝对我使馆的一切无理要求
    新华社十六日讯　突尼斯消息：中国驻突尼斯大使馆十五日向突尼斯政府外交部递交了一份中华人民共和国外交部十四日的照会，强烈抗议突尼斯总统污蔑中国和世界人民伟大领袖毛主席以及突尼斯政府非法扣留中国乒乓球教练和使馆人员，无理限制中国使馆人员进行正常活动等一系列严重的反华事件。照会严正指出，中国政府“决定立即召回为了帮助突尼斯发展体育事业而派出的四名中国体育教练，同时坚决拒绝突尼斯当局歧视中国大使馆的一切无理限制和要求”。
    照会说，应突尼斯政府聘请的中国乒乓球教练华正德，于今年七月十四日，在中国大使馆人员张家祥陪同下，前往比塞大从事例行教练活动时，比塞大警察局竟悍然非法扣留华正德和张家祥。中国大使馆为此曾向突尼斯外交部提出口头交涉和抗议。突尼斯外交部既不承认错误，又拒不承认保证中国大使馆人员和中国教练人身安全的责任，反而公然歧视中国大使馆，蛮横无理地要求使馆人员自八月十日起须经突尼斯外交部同意，方得去突尼斯省以外地区，而且接连发生无理刁难和阻拦中国使馆人员外出进行正常活动的严重事件。
    照会说：“更有甚者，布尔吉巴总统竟于八月二十三日亲自跳出来进行反华叫嚣，污蔑中国人民和世界人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，猖狂到了极点。”
    照会说，无可抵赖的事实证明，突尼斯政府有计划地、连续地采取了新的严重反华步骤。为此，中国政府向突尼斯政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会指出，中突两国建立外交关系以来，中国方面一贯积极争取发展两国人民的友好关系。然而，突尼斯政府却不断进行破坏两国人民友好关系的活动，其中包括参与美帝国主义为了长期霸占中国领土台湾省而策划的制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，严重地干涉了中国内政，侵犯了中国主权。对于中国大使馆的正常活动和外交特权，突尼斯政府不顾国际惯例，横加干涉和歧视，例如，禁止发行新闻公报，阻挠电影招待会的举行，扣押寄往大使馆的邮件等等。至于突尼斯政府直接并通过其反动报刊对中国进行恶毒污蔑和无耻诽谤，则日甚一日。
    照会强调指出：“突尼斯政府不顾中国方面的警告，一意孤行，在反华的道路上越走越远。这是中突两国人民决不能容忍的。”
    照会说：“突尼斯政府的反华活动，在这个时期加紧升级，绝非偶然。突尼斯人民和阿拉伯各国人民在反对美、英、以侵略和苏修叛卖的斗争中，又一次证实了中国人民是他们最可靠的朋友，毛泽东思想是争取解放的指路明灯。特别是毛泽东主席关于‘全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗’的伟大号召，以及用人民革命战争夺取最后胜利的光辉论述，正在被突尼斯人民和阿拉伯各国人民作为最强有力的武器武装着自己。美帝国主义和各国反动派为此吓破了胆，掀起了新的反华浪潮，妄图借此把突尼斯人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的怒火扑灭下去。突尼斯政府站在美帝国主义一边，分化瓦解阿拉伯人民的反帝阵线，从而引起了突尼斯人民和阿拉伯各国人民的无比愤怒和坚决反对。突尼斯政府的日子越来越不好过。现在，突尼斯政府竟然妄图用反华来转移突尼斯人民的视线，来掩盖自己进一步投靠美帝苏修和出卖突尼斯和阿拉伯各国人民利益的罪行，这是绝不会有好下场的。”
