Chairman Mao says: "We are now in a new great era of world revolution."

The world has entered a new era of great Mao Zedong Thought.

The glorious 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China has arrived amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On this brilliant occasion, as we survey the world, we see a magnificent revolutionary situation, which fills us with great inspiration and boundless enthusiasm.

The current characteristics of the world situation are as follows: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is sweeping across the entire world with irresistible force; the victorious clarion call of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is echoing around the globe; the strength of Marxism-Leninism worldwide is growing and becoming stronger through struggle; the armed struggles of oppressed peoples and nations for liberation and the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of the world are surging forward; imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are facing grave difficulties and are hastening towards their doom. The overall balance of forces and the trend of development in the international class struggle are such that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind.

Over the past year, the great Mao Zedong Thought has been more widely propagated throughout the world and has penetrated deeper into the hearts of the people. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the powerful inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the revolutionary people of the world have launched wave after wave of fierce attacks against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, achieving one great victory after another. The arming of hundreds of millions of people with Mao Zedong Thought to engage in revolutionary struggles is an important sign that the world has entered a new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. A revolutionary storm that will sweep away the entire old world is on the horizon. As long as the revolutionary people of the world raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen their unity, and fight bravely, they will surely be able to create a brilliant new world in the midst of the revolutionary storm!

    伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年，在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中到来了。在这光辉的节日里，我们环顾世界，看到了一片大好的革命形势，感到极大的鼓舞，无比的振奋。
    目前世界形势的特点是：战无不胜的毛泽东思想正在以雷霆万钧之力磅礴于整个世界；中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利号角响彻全球；全世界马克思列宁主义的力量正在斗争中发展壮大；被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的武装斗争和全世界人民的反美斗争蓬勃高涨；帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派困难重重，正在加速地走向自己的末日。整个国际阶级斗争的力量对比和发展趋势是东风压倒西风。
    一年来，伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界得到更加广泛的传播，日益深入人心。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下和中国无产阶级文化大革命的有力鼓舞下，全世界革命人民向帝修反进行了冲锋陷阵的斗争，取得了一个又一个的巨大胜利。亿万人民用毛泽东思想武装起来进行革命斗争，是世界进入伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代的重要标志。一场涤荡整个旧世界的革命风暴正在来临。全世界革命人民只要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，加强团结，英勇战斗，就一定能够在革命的风暴中创造一个红彤彤的新世界！
