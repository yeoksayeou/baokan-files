On the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great leader Chairman Mao, representatives from eight Red Army companies of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region held a symposium. By recalling their companies' combat histories, studying Chairman Mao's great teachings on armed seizure of power, and studying Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war and people's army, they shared their learning experiences.

The Glorious and Victorious Path

Vice Political Instructor Yang Dazhang of the Iron Red Second Company said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing and consolidating power." On the question of whether to seize power and how to seize it, there has long been a struggle between two lines within our party: one is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the other is the reactionary bourgeois line represented by Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and the Chinese Khrushchev.

Forty years ago, Chen Duxiu's right opportunism opposed Chairman Mao's correct line, abandoned armed struggle, and handed over the people's armed forces to the enemy, thus ruining a great revolution. At this critical moment in the revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao, with the great courage of a proletarian revolutionary, ignited the flames of armed struggle on the basis of the peasant movement in Hunan, led the historic Autumn Harvest Uprising, established the Jinggangshan base area, and created our unique people's army. At that time, our Red Second Company was led by Comrade Lin Biao up to Jinggangshan. On the majestic Jinggangshan, the troops were nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, rapidly grew and strengthened, went deep into the countryside, and mobilized the peasants to engage in armed struggle. Later, whether in the famous Long March, the flames of the Anti-Japanese War, or the decisive battle to bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime, our company followed Chairman Mao closely and, together with the brother units, conducted long-term armed struggle. Finally, we marched from Northeast China all the way to Hainan Island, planting the flag of victory on Wuzhishan.

From the path our company has taken, we deeply feel that: from the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the march to Jinggangshan, the path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed struggle opened by Chairman Mao is a glorious and victorious path. It is not only the correct path for the Chinese revolution but also the path for the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world to strive for liberation.

Vice Political Instructor Zhu Jinhai of the Heroic Red First Company said: The proletarian revolution must take the path of armed seizure of power. How can we advance victoriously on this path? Chairman Mao pointed out to the whole party: The vanguard of the proletariat must go deep into the countryside, mobilize, organize, and arm the peasants, rely on the peasants, establish rural base areas, and implement the strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside, ultimately seizing national power. This is a path that no one has ever taken before, a great development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao not only correctly solved this problem in theory but also set a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world in practice.

Chairman Mao personally led the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the march to Jinggangshan, establishing the first red base area. Our company was born under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. In the work "Care for the Masses' Livelihood and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," Chairman Mao once praised the work of the armed peasants in Xingguo, Jiangxi. The predecessor of our company was a peasant guerrilla force led by the Communist Party in the Xingguo area of Jiangxi, which was incorporated into the Red Army in 1929. Later, we always followed Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilized the masses wherever we went, fought the local tyrants and distributed land, established revolutionary base areas, and received the enthusiastic support of the people. Once, our company mobilized the masses to fight the local tyrants in a certain place, and a poor peasant received a vegetable bowl, which he did not want to use and gave it to our company as a souvenir, expressing his deep affection for his own children-in-arms. Later, the great leader Chairman Mao came to our company, and the kitchen used this vegetable bowl to serve Chairman Mao. To commemorate this glorious history and to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to establish revolutionary base areas, we call this vegetable bowl the "Red Vegetable Bowl." Carrying this "Red Vegetable Bowl," our company followed the great commander Chairman Mao from Jinggangshan to Shaanxi, from the Songhua River to Hainan Island, mobilizing the masses and arming the masses wherever we went. The "Red Vegetable Bowl" became our company's heirloom. Every time we see this heirloom, we think of the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary path he led us on. In the future, we will forever follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize to the end along the path he points out.

Building the People's Army with Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Political Instructor Yang Dazhang of the Iron Red Second Company said: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The people's army is the lifeline of the people, the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory. Seizing power relies on it, and consolidating power also relies on it. The forty-year history of our army from the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the present proves that to make this people's army a powerful weapon for the proletariat to seize and consolidate power, we must hold high the military line established by Chairman Mao during the Autumn Harvest Uprising and arm our troops with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Our company is an old Red Army company nurtured by Comrade Lin Biao with Mao Zedong Thought. As early as 1928, Chairman Mao sent a party representative to our company, established a party branch, organized a soldiers' committee, and established regular political and ideological work. Soon after the Red Army united, on a clear morning after the rain, Chairman Mao, accompanied by Comrade Lin Biao, personally inspected our company. Chairman Mao was very satisfied with our company's exemplary implementation of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and instructed the party representative: "To build the army, first build the party, and pay attention to developing party members." In this way, our company was placed under the absolute leadership of the party. In the long-term struggle that followed, our company always followed Chairman Mao's instructions and advanced along the military line formulated by Chairman Mao, achieving one victory after another. During the Long March, our company was the spearhead, leading the charge, marching 240 li in one day. Twenty-two heroes, led by Company Commander Liao Dazhu, braved the gunfire and crossed the iron chain bridge to capture the Luding Bridge. What was the key to this victory? It was the prominence of proletarian politics and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Liaoxi Campaign, the "Iron Warrior" Deng Zhanshan of our company had both legs and his right hand blown off by the enemy, but he fearlessly defended the position until he died a heroic death. What was his strength? It was still politics, his unlimited loyalty to the party and Chairman Mao, his unlimited love for the people, and his deep hatred for the class enemies. Countless facts make us deeply feel that: politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all our work. We rely on politics to build the army, rely on politics to fight, and rely on Mao Zedong Thought to be invincible. If we forget politics and depart from Mao Zedong Thought, the army will lose its direction, make mistakes, and even change its color.

Class Leader Su Fuyuan of the Heroic Red Fifth Company and Deputy Company Commander Long Haiyun of the Heroic Red First Company said: The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have always opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's military line. Peng Dehuai, this old counter-revolutionary revisionist, under the guise of "regularization" and "modernization," promoted a set of revisionist goods imported from abroad, attempting to cancel the party's absolute leadership over the military, cancel military political work, and lead our army onto the path of a bourgeois army, realizing his plot to usurp the party and the military. Another counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, like Peng Dehuai, fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on the "Four Firsts" and emphasizing politics, and stubbornly promoted the revisionist bourgeois military line, organizing military "competitions," attempting to impact proletarian politics, change the nature of our army, and ultimately realize the goal of usurping the party and the military. At that time, many cadres and soldiers proposed to maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of the Red Army companies, and someone said, "Why emphasize the Red Army companies? As long as the army can fight, it's fine!" This is completely the fallacy criticized by Chairman Mao in the Resolution of the Gutian Conference, that the task of the Red Army is simply to fight. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, these two big conspirators and big dreamers, wanted to remodel our people's army in the image of the bourgeoisie, turning the army into a tool for their counter-revolutionary restoration. This is completely a pipe dream! Our company, through serious study of Chairman Mao's Gutian Conference Resolution and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics, recalled the company's glorious tradition of building the army and fighting with politics, eliminated the influence of pure military thought, and greatly strengthened the company's revolutionary and combat readiness.

In the past, we followed the great commander Chairman Mao through the great storms of war. Today, the great leader Chairman Mao calls on us to carry out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," learn the skills of class struggle in the great storms of class struggle, accept new revolutionary baptisms, and accept the examination of the broad revolutionary masses. This is an examination without tests. This is the greatest concern of Chairman Mao for us. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country, unite with the revolutionary masses of the whole country, fight together, and win together. With revolutionary spirit, we will carry out the revolutionary spirit of beating down the "fallen dogs," thoroughly criticize and repudiate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, overthrow and expose them, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and ensure that our great motherland and great army forever remain red.

Let the Fire of the Autumn Harvest Uprising Burn Across the Globe

The representatives, in their symposium, looked forward to the current great situation of the world revolution and said with great emotion: The flames of the Autumn Harvest Uprising are burning across the globe, and the boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought are illuminating the whole world.

Platoon Leader Yang Diti of the Assault Red Ninth Company, Medical Assistant Zhang Kedi of the Model Red Medical Team, Deputy Political Instructor Zhang Minghai of the Red Second Company, and Deputy Political Instructor Luo Shixun of the Red Third Company said: During the Jinggangshan struggle, the revolutionary forces were small, and the struggle was very arduous. Our great leader Chairman Mao, with great confidence, brilliantly pointed out: "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Chairman Mao's wise foresight has become a great reality. The flames of the Autumn Harvest Uprising have already spread across the whole of China and are now spreading across the globe. The revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly recognizing that to break the shackles of imperialism and domestic reactionaries and achieve the thorough liberation of oppressed nations and peoples, they must take the path of the Chinese revolution, that is, the path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed struggle. Now, more and more countries and regions' revolutionary peoples are taking up arms and walking the path of armed struggle. As Comrade Lin Biao said in the article "Long Live the Victory of People's War": "If North America and Western Europe are the 'cities of the world,' then Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the 'countryside of the world.'" Now, the revolutionary peoples of these "countryside of the world" are, under the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce attack on the "cities of the world" led by American imperialism. The "spark" of armed struggle will inevitably burn across the globe, burying the old world and building a new world.

The representatives also mentioned: In the current world revolutionary situation, the tasks facing our army are more arduous and heavy. In the past, the hopes of the whole nation were placed on Jinggangshan; today, the hearts of revolutionary peoples of the whole world are turned towards Chairman Mao and this red base area of China. To ensure that this world revolutionary base area never changes color, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the past, our revolutionary forebears followed Chairman Mao through the great storms of revolutionary war, spreading the sparks of the Autumn Harvest Uprising across the whole of China. Today, we follow Chairman Mao through the great storms of class struggle, determined to inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the Jinggangshan struggle, build new achievements for the people, and contribute all our strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

　　让秋收起义的烈火燃遍全世界
　　——广州部队某部八个红军连队代表座谈纪要
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义四十周年的时候，广州部队某部八个红军连队的代表举行了座谈。他们通过回忆自己连队的战斗历史，学习毛主席关于武装夺取政权的伟大学说，学习毛主席关于人民战争、人民军队的伟大思想，畅谈了自己的学习体会。
    光荣的道路　胜利的道路
    钢铁红二连副指导员杨达璋说：毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在要不要夺取政权和怎样夺取政权的问题上，我们党内长期存在着两条路线的斗争：一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，一条是以陈独秀、王明、中国赫鲁晓夫等为代表的资产阶级反动路线。
    四十年前，陈独秀右倾机会主义对抗毛主席的正确路线，放弃武装斗争，把人民武装力量拱手送给敌人，把一场轰轰烈烈的大革命断送了。在这革命的紧要关头，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，以无产阶级革命家的伟大胆略，在湖南农民运动的基础上，亲手点燃了武装斗争的熊熊烈火，领导了具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义，创立了井冈山根据地，缔造了我们这支举世无双的人民军队。当时，我们红二连就是在林彪同志的率领下上了井冈山。在巍峨的井冈山上，部队受到毛泽东思想的哺育，迅速地成长壮大，深入农村，发动农民进行武装斗争。以后，无论是在举世闻名的长征中，在抗日战争的烽火里，还是在埋葬蒋家王朝的决战中，我们连紧紧跟着毛主席，和兄弟部队一起，进行了长期的武装斗争。最后，从东北一直打到海南岛，把胜利的旗帜插上了五指山。
    从我们连队走过的道路，我们深深体会到：从秋收起义到向井冈山进军，毛主席开辟的这一条农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路，是光荣的道路、胜利的道路。它不仅是中国革命唯一正确的道路，而且是全世界无产阶级和革命人民争取解放的道路。
    英勇红一连副指导员朱金海说：无产阶级革命要走武装夺取政权的道路。怎样才能在这条道路上胜利前进呢？毛主席向全党指出：无产阶级先锋队要深入农村，发动、组织和武装农民，依靠农民，建立农村根据地，实行农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。这是前人从来没有走过的道路，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。毛主席不但在理论上正确地解决了这个问题，而且在实践上也为世界革命人民做出了光辉的榜样。
    毛主席亲自领导了秋收起义和向井冈山进军，建立了第一个红色根据地。我们连就是在毛主席的正确路线领导下诞生的。在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇著作里，毛主席曾经表扬江西兴国武装农民的工作做得好。我们连队的前身，就是江西兴国地区一支由共产党领导的农民游击队，一九二九年编入红军。后来，一直遵照毛主席的指示，走到那里就在那里发动群众，打土豪分田地，建立革命根据地，受到人民群众的热烈拥护。有一次，我们连在某地发动群众打土豪，一个贫农分到一个菜盆，他舍不得用，送给我们连作纪念，表示对自己的子弟兵衷心拥护的深情厚谊。后来，伟大领袖毛主席来到我们连，炊事班就用这个菜盆给毛主席盛菜。为了纪念这段光荣历史，为了坚决执行毛主席建立革命根据地的指示，我们把这个菜盆叫做“红菜盆”。带着这个“红菜盆”，我们连紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，从井冈山到陕北，从松花江到海南岛，走到那里就在那里发动群众、组织群众和武装群众。“红菜盆”成了我们连的传家宝。每当我们看到这个传家宝，就想起伟大领袖毛主席对我们的教导，就想起毛主席领导我们走过的这一条革命的道路。今后，我们要永远跟着毛主席，沿着毛主席指引的道路革命到底。
    用毛泽东思想建设人民军队
    钢铁红二连副指导员杨达璋说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民军队是人民的命根子，是革命胜利的根本保证。夺取政权依靠它，巩固政权也要依靠它。从秋收起义到现在，我军四十年的历史经验证明，要想使这支人民军队成为无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权的强大武器，就必须高举毛主席在秋收起义时规定的建军路线，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装我们的部队。
    我们连是林彪副主席亲自用毛泽东思想培育起来的老红军连队。早在一九二八年，毛主席就向我们连派来了党代表，在连队建立了党支部，组织了士兵委员会，建立了经常性的政治思想工作。红军会师不久，一个雨后初晴的早晨，毛主席在林彪同志的陪同下，亲自视察了我们连队。毛主席对我们连模范地执行了“三大纪律六项注意”很满意，并指示党代表：要建军，先建党，要重视发展党员工作。这样，就使我们连队置于党的绝对领导下。在以后的长期斗争中，我们连一直遵照毛主席的指示，沿着毛主席制定的建军路线前进，取得一个又一个的胜利。万里长征，我们连当尖刀，打头阵，一天走了二百四十里，二十二位勇士，在连长廖大珠的率领下，冒着枪林弹雨，从铁索桥上爬过去，夺取了泸定桥。这场战斗的胜利靠什么？靠突出无产阶级政治，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在辽西会战中，我们连“钢铁战士”邓占山两条大腿和右手被敌人炸掉了，但他无所畏惧，坚守阵地，直到壮烈牺牲。他凭什么？还是凭政治，凭对党、对毛主席的无限忠诚，对人民的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。无数事实使我们深刻体会到：政治是统帅，是灵魂，是我军一切工作的生命线。我们靠政治建军，靠政治打仗，靠毛泽东思想，就无往而不胜。如果忘记了政治，离开了毛泽东思想，部队就会迷失方向，就会犯错误，甚至会使我们的军队改变颜色。
    渡海英雄红五连班长苏福元、英雄红一连副连长龙海云说：中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，一贯反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的建军路线。彭德怀这个老反革命修正主义分子，打着什么“正规化”、“现代化”的幌子，推行从外国搬来的一套修正主义货色，妄图取消党对军队的绝对领导，取消军队的政治工作，把我军引上资产阶级军队的道路，实现他篡党篡军的阴谋。另一个反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，和彭德怀一样，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对林副主席提出的四个第一和突出政治的指示，顽固地推行反革命修正主义的资产阶级军事路线，搞什么军事“大比武”，妄图冲击无产阶级的政治，改变我军的性质，最后实现篡党篡军的目的。当时，广大干部、战士提出要保持和发扬红军连队的光荣传统，有人就说：“强调红军连队干啥，只要军队能打仗就行！”这完全是毛主席在古田会议决议中所批判的那种红军的任务只是单纯地打仗的谬论。彭德怀、罗瑞卿这两个大阴谋家，大野心家，就是要按照资产阶级的面貌改造我们的人民军队，使军队变成他们实行反革命复辟的工具。这完全是白日做梦！我们连队通过认真学习毛主席古田会议决议和林副主席关于突出政治的指示，回忆连队靠政治建军，靠政治打仗的光荣传统，肃清了单纯军事思想的影响，大大地加强了连队的革命化、战斗化。
    过去，我们跟着伟大统帅毛主席从战争的大风大浪中闯过来了。今天，伟大领袖毛主席号召我们执行“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里学习阶级斗争的本领，接受新的战斗的革命洗礼，接受广大革命群众的检验。这是一场不考试的考试。这是毛主席他老人家对我们最大的关怀。我们一定不辜负毛主席和全国人民的期望，和全国无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，拿出革命的劲头，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们伟大的祖国和伟大的军队，永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    让秋收起义之火燃遍全球
    代表们在座谈中，展望了当前世界革命的大好形势，满怀激情地说：秋收起义的熊熊烈火正在燃遍全球，光焰无际的毛泽东思想正照耀着全世界。
    突击红九连排长杨迪锐、模范红色卫生队医助张克迪、红二连副指导员张明海、红三连副指导员罗时训等同志说：在井冈山斗争时期，革命力量很小，斗争十分艰苦，我们伟大领袖毛主席满怀信心地天才地指出：“星星之火，可以燎原”。毛主席英明的预见已经成了伟大的现实。秋收起义的烈火已经燃遍了全中国，正在燃遍全世界。亚非拉革命人民越来越清楚地认识到：要打掉帝国主义和国内反动派的枷锁，取得被压迫民族和被压迫人民的彻底解放，必须走中国革命的道路，就是以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路。现在，已经有越来越多的国家和地区的革命人民拿起枪杆子，走上武装斗争的道路。正象林彪副主席在《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中所说：“如果说北美、西欧是‘世界的城市’，那么，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲就是‘世界的农村’。”现在，这些“世界的农村”的革命人民，正在我国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向美帝国主义为首的“世界的城市”展开猛烈的进攻，武装斗争的“星星之火”，必将燃遍全球，埋葬旧世界，建设新世界。
    代表们还谈到：在当前的世界革命形势下，摆在我军面前的任务更加繁重、艰巨。当年，全国人民的希望寄托在井冈山；今天，全世界革命人民的心都向着毛主席，向着中国这块红色的根据地。为了使这块世界的革命根据地永不变色，毛主席亲自发动和领导了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。过去，我们的革命前辈跟着毛主席在革命战争的大风大浪中前进，把秋收起义的火种燃遍全中国，今天，我们跟着毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中前进，一定要继承和发扬秋收起义、井冈山斗争的光荣传统，为人民建新功、立新劳，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己的全部力量。
