According to the New China News Agency on September 29, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with African Countries held a reception today to warmly celebrate the national day of the Republic of Guinea.

At the reception filled with a friendly atmosphere, Vice Chairman Ding Xilin of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with African Countries and Chargé d'Affaires Kamara of the Guinean Embassy in China spoke successively.

Ding Xilin, in his speech, denounced U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism for sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the African people.

Ding Xilin said that the Chinese people, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will more resolutely support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggles of the African people and the people of the world.

Chargé d'Affaires Kamara expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for their sincere, friendly, selfless, and unconditional assistance to the Guinean people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He said that this brotherly assistance embodies the principle of proletarian internationalism that the Chinese people are implementing under the leadership of the great Communist Party. The Chinese experts and technicians assisting Guinea, educated under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are reliable friends of the Guinean people.

The Chargé d'Affaires praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, makes the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America increasingly happy to see the great achievements brought by this movement. It promotes the spirit of thorough revolution among the people and provides strong support to the people of various countries in their fierce struggles against imperialism and colonialism. Every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is not only a victory for Mao Zedong Thought but also a victory for the people of various countries fighting against imperialism and colonialism.

Guests invited to the reception also included Guinean friends in Beijing.
