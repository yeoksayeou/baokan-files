A new wave of revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party has swept across the country! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved a new victory. Columns of revolutionary criticism are everywhere in the streets, like daggers piercing the vital points of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party; like magic mirrors revealing the true faces of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, leaving them with nowhere to hide. They are already engulfed in the vast ocean of the people's war.

"Against any and all who dare to resist, we must be ruthless, thorough, clean, and complete in our annihilation of them."

The revolutionary workers of Shanghai are filled with indignation and fury against the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in his anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. The textile workers of the No. 31 Cotton Mill have taken up their pens as swords and guns to launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev.		Photographer: Yang Puyang

"Drown the enemy in an ocean of disaster."

The columns of big-character posters for revolutionary criticism on the streets of Shanghai are a vast battlefield for opening fire on China's Khrushchev. This is a good form of self-education by the masses, warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

"You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The revolutionary masses of Beijing, following the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, are hoisting high the banner of revolutionary criticism, determined to criticize China's Khrushchev deeply and thoroughly, to criticize him down and stink him up, politically, ideologically, and theoretically!

"Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war."

The revolutionary masses of Shanghai, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev, have been posting batch after batch of revolutionary big-character posters on the streets, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev.

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, they seem terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful."

Pick up the pen as a sword and gun, expose and criticize China's Khrushchev thoroughly, making him a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat him.

"Pursue the fleeing enemy to the end, do not be like King Xiang Yu who sought fame by learning from the past."

Revolutionary students and teachers in Beijing resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a high tide of criticism within the school, concentrating firepower on China's Khrushchev, and resolutely smashing the bourgeois headquarters to pieces.
