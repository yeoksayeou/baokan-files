The Indian reactionary government has turned Sikkim into a base for aggressing against China, tightening its control over Sikkim and more brutally enslaving the Sikkimese people.

Gangtok, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) — Before and after the Indian reactionary government launched armed attacks on the China-Sikkim border, it adopted various measures to tighten its control over Sikkim and more brutally enslave the Sikkimese people.

Before launching the attack on China, the Indian reactionary government sent more invading troops into Sikkim. These troops have imposed an even heavier burden on Sikkim, which has a population of only 160,000.

After the Indian invading troops launched an attack on the China-Sikkim border on the 11th, they intensified their brutal rule in Sikkim and imposed even stricter control over the Sikkimese people. According to Western news agencies, the Indian reactionaries have divided the Sikkimese capital, Gangtok, into 17 so-called "civil defense" zones, each controlled by a person who is obviously under the command of the Indian rulers. It is reported that "the Sikkimese people have been ordered to close their windows and stay indoors to study civil defense regulations."

The Indian reactionaries shamelessly spread rumors, claiming that the Chinese border defense forces have broadcasted that they will send aircraft to bomb the Indian troops and Sikkimese people on the China-Sikkim border. Based on this, New Delhi issued an order to Sikkim to implement a blackout starting from the night of the 13th, forcing all vehicles and residences to cover their lights. The Indian reactionaries have thus viciously spread lies, attempting to incite anti-China sentiments among the Sikkimese people.

According to a report by the United Press International on the 15th, "Gangtok is busy preparing for a possible war. Even primary school students have been included in the rapidly expanding war preparedness campaign." This exposes the Indian reactionaries' plot to force the Sikkimese people to become cannon fodder for their aggression against China.

The Indian reactionary government's "political agent" in Sikkim, who controls Sikkim's foreign affairs, defense, and other powers, B. Mehta, delivered a speech in Gangtok on the 15th, spouting anti-China nonsense and distorting the Indian reactionaries' barefaced aggression as a "limited response" to China's "attack." The Indian reactionaries have used force to turn Sikkim into their "protectorate" and a military base for aggression against China. The Indian invading troops' rampage in Sikkim has brought immense suffering to the Sikkimese people. The Chinese people have great sympathy for the Sikkimese people. The Indian reactionaries' malicious actions to sow discord between the Chinese and Sikkimese peoples will not succeed.

### 印度反动政府把锡金变为侵略中国基地  加紧控制锡金，更加残暴地奴役锡金人民

    印度反动政府把锡金变为侵略中国基地
    加紧控制锡金，更加残暴地奴役锡金人民
    新华社十六日讯　甘托克消息：印度反动政府在中国—锡金边境向中国发动武装进攻前后，采取种种办法加紧控制锡金，更加残暴地奴役锡金人民。
    印度反动政府在向中国发动进攻以前，就把更多侵略军队开进锡金。这些军队给只有十六万人口的锡金造成更加沉重的负担。
    印度侵略军十一日在中锡边境发动进攻以后，就在锡金加强它的残暴统治，更加严密地控制锡金人民。据西方通讯社透露，印度反动派把锡金首都甘托克划分为十七个所谓“民防”区，每区由一名显然受印度统治者指挥的人员来控制。据报道：“锡金人奉命关上窗子在屋里学习民防规定”。
    印度反动派无耻地散布谣言，说什么中国边防部队广播说要出动空军轰炸中锡边境上的印度军队和锡金。新德里据此向锡金下了命令，从十三日晚上起实行灯火管制，硬要所有车辆和住宅把灯光罩起来。印度反动派就这样卑鄙地造谣，妄图在锡金人民中煽起反华情绪。
    据合众国际社十五日报道，“甘托克正在忙于准备一场可能的战争。”“甚至小学生也被列入迅速开展的备战运动的名单中。”这暴露出，印度反动派阴谋迫使锡金人民充当它侵略中国的炮灰。
    印度反动政府驻在锡金并控制锡金外交、国防等权力的“政治专员”巴·梅农，十五日在甘托克发表反华谬论，颠倒黑白地把印度反动派赤裸裸的侵略行径，歪曲为对中国“进攻”的“有限的回答”。印度反动派用武力强行把锡金变成它的“保护国”和侵略中国的军事基地，印度侵略军在锡金横行霸道给锡金人民带来了巨大的苦难。中国人民对锡金人民是很同情的。印度反动派挑拨中锡两国人民关系的恶劣做法，是不能得逞的。
