		Rome, September 14th - The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, "New Unity" newspaper, recently published an article praising the revolutionary spirit demonstrated by the crew of the Chinese distant-water cargo ship "Dawn" in their brave resistance against the anti-China political provocations by the Italian authorities. The article pointed out that once the broad masses of workers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will become an invincible revolutionary force.

		The article said, "The crew of the 'Dawn' is not alone. The Italian people's support for the courageous actions and firm stance of the Chinese sailors is growing stronger. The struggle of the 'Dawn' crew has received active support and solidarity from the workers of Genoa. In recent days, numerous big-character posters, declarations, and large banners reading 'Long Live Chairman Mao' have appeared in Genoa. In the ports and factories, large banners have been hung, all of which praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

		The article said, the quotations and slogans of Chairman Mao hung on the 'Dawn' have made the Italian authorities tremble with fear. The reaction of the workers in Genoa, however, is completely different. Especially the dock workers, their fighting spirit resonates with the firm and brave actions of the 'Dawn' crew. The quotation from Comrade Mao Zedong hung on the ship: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools," is also applicable to the Italian reactionaries. This reflects the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

		The article said, through this new experience, our party once again saw that the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong have a great attraction for workers, arousing their great enthusiasm. When the loudspeakers broadcast the quotations of Chairman Mao in the squares, streets, and in front of factories in Genoa, people applauded. "All this shows that once workers, youth, and the broad masses of laborers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will become an invincible revolutionary force capable of transforming themselves and the world."

		The article concluded, "Just as the crew of the 'Dawn' quoted the teachings of Chairman Mao, any provocation against the people can only increase the people's revolutionary spirit."

		"New Unity" also published a letter from the National Committee of the Italian Anti-Imperialist Front to the crew of the "Dawn."

		The letter expressed respect for the brave struggle of the Chinese sailors and thanked them for their friendship and solidarity with the Italian people. The letter also strongly condemned the atrocities committed by the Italian authorities in following the U.S. imperialists against the "Dawn," and highly praised the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

    意《新团结报》盛赞我“黎明”号船员英勇斗争的革命精神
    毛泽东思想被群众掌握就变成不可战胜的力量
    我船员的斗争得到意人民积极支持，热那亚出现许多大字报和“毛主席万岁！”的标语
    新华社十四日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《新团结报》最近发表评论，热烈赞扬中国远洋货轮“黎明”号全体船员在英勇抗击意大利当局的反华政治挑衅时所表现的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。评论指出，广大劳动群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就会变成一股不可战胜的革命力量。
    评论说，“黎明”号船员并不是孤立的。意大利人民群众对中国船员的英勇行为和坚定态度的支持日益增强。“黎明”号船员的斗争，得到了热那亚劳动者的积极声援和支持。这几天，在热那亚出现了许多大字报、声明和“毛泽东万岁”的巨幅标语。在港口和工厂都悬挂了巨幅标语，所有这些标语都赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    评论说，“黎明”号船上悬挂的毛主席语录和标语，使意大利当局胆战心惊。热那亚劳动者的反应则完全是另一样。特别是码头工人，他们的斗志同“黎明”号船员坚定而英勇的行动交相辉映。船上悬挂的毛泽东同志的语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。”也适用于意大利的反动派。这反映出马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理。
    评论说，我们党通过这次新的经历，又一次地看到毛泽东同志的思想对劳动者有着巨大的吸引力，能引起劳动者的巨大热情。在热那亚广场、街道和工厂前，当扩音器广播毛主席语录时，人们就鼓掌。“这一切说明，一旦工人、青年和广大劳动群众掌握毛泽东思想时，就会变成一股不可战胜的、能改造自己和世界的革命力量。”
    评论最后说，“正象‘黎明’号船员引用的毛主席语录所教导的那样，任何反对人民的挑衅，只能增长人民的革命精神。”
    《新团结报》同时刊登了意大利反帝阵线全国委员会给“黎明”号船员的一封信。
    信中对中国船员的英勇斗争表示敬意，并对他们同意大利人民友好和团结表示感谢。信中还严厉谴责意大利当局追随美帝国主义对“黎明”号犯下的暴行，并高度赞扬了战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
