On September 11, the Indian aggressor troops brazenly crossed the border at Nathu La Pass into the China-Sikkim border and launched a fierce attack on our border defense forces. Until yesterday, the Indian aggressor troops continued to bombard our territory with heavy artillery. This is a serious armed provocation by the Indian reactionaries against our country, a military adventure they have long planned. The Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation.

The propaganda machine of the Indian reactionary government claims, “This is just an accidental incident.” They are lying in public and trying to shirk responsibility. But the facts are clear, how can they deny them?

The Indian government has long been amassing troops along the China-Sikkim border. Since August, despite repeated warnings from our country, Indian troops have repeatedly invaded our border areas. On September 11, Indian troops launched a large-scale military attack, firing guns and cannons at our border defense forces for several days. After the Chinese government lodged a protest and warning with the Indian government, the Indian troops' armed provocations not only did not stop but intensified their bombardment of our border defense forces. How can this be called an “accidental incident”? This is clearly a planned, prepared, and deliberate military attack.

The Indian reactionaries' aggression and provocation are instigated by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Everyone knows that the weapons and equipment of the Indian aggressor troops are provided by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. In recent times, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have been continuously inciting their lackeys to engage in rampant anti-China activities. The Indian reactionaries are one of their anti-China henchmen. After the Indian reactionaries launched their aggression and provocation, the propaganda machines of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism immediately attacked China for escalating the “border tension,” defending the Indian aggressors. Whose orders the Indian reactionaries are following is now crystal clear.

The Indian reactionaries have been creating incidents on the China-India border, inciting anti-China sentiment to get out of their internal and external predicaments. This is their usual trick. This time, launching a large-scale armed provocation is also out of their urgent need to maintain their reactionary rule.

Currently, the Indian reactionary government is facing deep political and economic crises. The national famine is becoming increasingly severe. Anti-hunger and anti-oppression struggles are rising everywhere. In particular, the armed peasant struggle starting from Naxalbari has shaken the reactionary rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. The Indian reactionaries want to use the launching of armed aggression against China to divert the attention of the domestic people, making it easier for them to suppress the peasant revolutionary struggle.

The Indian reactionary government's launching of armed aggression against China is also to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai is currently active in the United States. Indian Defense Minister Singh is also going to Moscow to seek aid. The Indian reactionary government's large-scale armed provocation against China at this time is to beg their masters for more dollars and rubles.

The Indian reactionaries' creation of this armed provocation incident on the China-Sikkim border has another ulterior motive, which is to use this to fabricate the lie of China's “threat” to Sikkim, to sow discord between the Chinese and Sikkimese people, to strengthen their control over Sikkim, and to try to make Sikkim permanently their protectorate.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “Our enemies are the backward, rotten, and reactionary forces. They are doomed to perish. They do not understand the laws of the objective world. They use subjective and metaphysical methods to think about things, so their estimates are always wrong.”

The Indian reactionaries are exactly like this. They always misjudge the situation. In 1962, they brazenly launched a large-scale armed attack on our country, resulting in a bloody defeat. But it seems that they have completely forgotten the lesson of that defeat.

We must warn the Indian reactionaries: you have miscalculated again. You will not be able to gain anything from your military provocation against China. Debts must be repaid. Our consistent policy is: “If others do not offend us, we will not offend them; if others offend us, we will certainly offend them.” If you insist on fighting, then you will have to taste the iron fist of the Chinese people again!

    印度反动派又错打了算盘		本报评论员
    九月十一日，印度侵略军公然在乃堆拉山口越过中锡边界，向我国边防部队发起猛烈进攻。直到昨天，印度侵略军仍继续以重炮向我国境内进行疯狂轰击。这是印度反动派对我国进行的严重的武装挑衅，是他们策划已久的一次军事冒险行动。中国人民正在密切注视着局势的发展。
    印度反动当局的宣传机器扬言，“这不过是一次偶然事件”。他们当众撒谎，妄图抵赖罪责。但是事实俱在，怎么能够赖得掉呢？
    印度政府早就在中锡边境集结了大量军队。八月份以来，印军不顾我国一再警告，连续多次侵入我国边境地区。九月十一日，印军就发动了大规模的军事进攻，向我边防部队开枪打炮，为时达几天之久。当中国政府向印度政府提出抗议和警告之后，印军的武装挑衅非但没有停止，反而加剧了对中国边防部队的炮击。这哪里是什么“偶然事件”？这明明是有计划、有准备、蓄意进行的军事进攻。
    印度反动派的侵略挑衅，是美帝苏修策动的。谁都知道，印度侵略军的武器装备，是由美帝苏修提供的。最近时期，美帝苏修不断鼓动它们的仆从，进行猖狂的反华活动，印度反动派就是它们的一名反华打手。在印度反动派发动侵略挑衅以后，美帝苏修的宣传机器立即攻击中国加剧“边境紧张局势”，为印度侵略者辩护。印度反动派是奉谁之命行事的，这难道还不一清二楚吗？
    印度反动派制造中印边境事件，煽动反华，来摆脱它内外交困的处境，已经是他们的惯技了。这次发动大规模的武装挑衅，也是出于维护他们反动统治的迫切需要。
    目前，印度反动政府面临着深刻的政治、经济危机。全国饥荒越来越严重。反饥饿反暴政的斗争此伏彼起。特别是从纳萨尔巴里开始的农民武装斗争，震撼了大地主大资产阶级的反动统治。印度反动派妄想用发动对中国的武装侵略来转移国内人民的视线，便于他们镇压农民革命斗争。
    印度反动政府发动对中国的武装侵略，也是为了向美帝苏修邀功请赏。印度副总理兼财政部长德赛目前正在美国活动。印度国防部长辛格也将要去莫斯科求援。印度反动政府在这个时候对中国大规模武装挑衅，就是要向他们的主子乞讨更多的美元和卢布。
    印度反动派在中锡边境制造这一武装挑衅事件，还有一个不可告人的目的，就是借此编造中国“威胁”锡金的谰言，挑拨中锡人民的友好关系，便于加强它对锡金的控制，企图使锡金永远作为它的保护国。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们的敌人是落后的腐朽的反动派，他们是注定要灭亡的，他们不懂得客观世界的规律，他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。”
    印度反动派正是这样。他们总是错误估计形势。一九六二年，他们悍然向我国发动大规模武装进攻，结果碰得头破血流。但是看来，他们现在已经把那一次惨败的教训忘得一干二净了。
    我们要正告印度反动派，你们又一次错打了算盘。你们休想在对中国的军事挑衅中，捞到任何稻草。欠债是一定要还的。我们的一贯方针是：“人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。”如果你们一定要打下去，那就要让你们再一次尝尝中国人民铁拳头的滋味！
