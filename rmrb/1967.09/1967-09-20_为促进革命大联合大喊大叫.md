The administrative office's "One·Two·Two Revolutionary Rebel Corps" has taken a thrilling first step towards achieving revolutionary great unity within the unit—issuing an open letter to the Red Rebels and frankly criticizing the non-proletarian thoughts in their minds that hinder great unity. This is a revolutionary action!

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class must change the whole of society in the struggle against the class enemy and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time change itself. The working class must learn in the course of work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." At present, we should even more firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, constantly analyze ourselves, criticize ourselves, overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and strive to promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Are there contradictions between the two revolutionary mass organizations in the administrative office? Yes, there are. Are there right and wrong issues? Yes, there are. But these contradictions and right and wrong issues are fundamentally incomparable with the great right and wrong issues of the decisive struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Why should we, because of internal right and wrong issues among the people, remain split for a long time and weaken the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party?

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces: Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions! Let us quickly unite! According to Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, unify our thoughts, actions, and steps, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

We eagerly look forward to the day when the administrative office achieves revolutionary great unity.

    为促进革命大联合大喊大叫
    行政办公室一·二二革命造反兵团，为实现本单位的革命大联合，迈出了令人兴奋的第一步——发表致红色造反者的一封公开信，并且坦率地检讨了自己头脑中妨碍大联合的非无产阶级思想。这是一个革命的行动！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”当前，我们应该更加牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，不断对自己一分为二，检讨自己，破私立公，努力促进无产阶级革命派的大联合。　　
    行政办公室的两大革命群众组织之间有矛盾吗？有矛盾。有是非吗？有是非。但是这些矛盾和是非，同当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的大是大非，是根本不能相比的。我们有什么理由因为人民内部的是非问题，而长期分裂下去，削弱对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的力量呢？
    无产阶级革命派的战友们：坚决执行毛主席的指示，让我们赶快联合起来吧！按照毛主席的战略部署，统一思想，统一行动，统一步伐，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们热烈期待行政办公室实现革命大联合的一天尽快地到来。
