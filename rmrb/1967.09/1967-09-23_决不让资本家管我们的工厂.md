Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. 'Without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed.'"

China's Khrushchev, in order to realize his plot to restore capitalism, has always opposed Chairman Mao's instructions. He shamelessly advocates that 'capitalists and foremen should be able to manage factories' and fawningly praises 'their submission to socialism and service to socialism.' Under the protection of China's Khrushchev's counterrevolutionary fallacies, the capitalists in our factory became arrogant after the public-private partnership. They used the banner of 'managing the factory' and 'serving socialism' to seize various powers in the factory. After these bloodsuckers took power, did they really 'manage the factory' and 'serve socialism' for us? No, absolutely not. Let me share my personal experience!

I am an electric welder. In 1963, I noticed that a circular cutting machine in the workshop was very bulky and difficult to raise and lower. Inspired by Chairman Mao's revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, I wanted to convert it into an automated machine. The conversion required a few old equipment parts, and I happened to find an old piece of equipment in the warehouse that could be used. So, I went to discuss it with the capitalist section chief in charge of equipment. This capitalist, upon hearing that I wanted to innovate technology, frowned and harshly said to me: "I have to manage the factory well. Equipment cannot be used at will. Technological innovation requires a report first, design drawings, cost calculations, approval from the factory, and then submission to the company for approval. Otherwise, if you act recklessly, who will be responsible for the waste of money?" After hearing this, my enthusiasm was dampened by half, and I had no choice but to return.

However, a few days later, I accidentally discovered that the old equipment I originally wanted had been dismantled into pieces and thrown into the scrap pile. Seeing this, I was so angry that my teeth chattered. These guys were clearly obstructing us! I secretly resolved to succeed and show them! So, I didn't hesitate to personally search through the scrap pile, piecing together the dismantled parts, and with the help of my comrades, finally succeeded in converting the circular cutting machine into an automated one. However, this bastard capitalist was extremely hostile to this. He colluded with the capitalist-roaders in the party within the factory to scold me severely and used administrative authority to criticize me in front of the entire factory, labeling me with all sorts of baseless accusations such as 'disregarding the organization' and 'disregarding leadership,' 'arbitrary and undisciplined,' and 'violating regulations,' etc. While this cunning capitalist seemed to be a 'model of upholding principles,' it was simply outrageous!

In a socialist enterprise, not exposing the various plots and sabotage activities of capitalists, not fighting against capitalist forces, but instead suppressing the enthusiasm of the working class to build socialism and fighting against the working class, what is this if not bourgeois dictatorship?

This is the result of China's Khrushchev advocating that capitalists should 'manage factories.' The heinous crime of China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism and reverse historical progress must be settled!

### 决不让资本家管我们的工厂

　　决不让资本家管我们的工厂

    毛主席教导我们：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。”“没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，为了实现他复辟资本主义的阴谋，一直和毛主席的指示相对抗，无耻地叫嚷要“使资本家、工头能够管理工厂”，肉麻地吹捧“他们服从社会主义，为社会主义服务”。在中国赫鲁晓夫这种反革命谬论的庇护下，我们厂里的资本家在公私合营后一个个都趾高气扬。他们打着“管理工厂”“为社会主义服务”的招牌，窃踞厂里的各种大权。这些吸血鬼掌了权以后，真的是为我们“管理工厂”、在“为社会主义服务”吗？不，绝对不是。就拿我个人的亲身经历来看一看吧！
    我是一个电焊割刀工，一九六三年，我看到车间里一台圆周割刀机很笨重，升降又困难，于是我在毛主席教导的敢想、敢说、敢做的革命精神鼓舞下，就想把它改装成自动化。改装需要几样旧设备零件，正好我发现仓库里有一台旧设备可利用，于是我就去找管设备的资本家科长商量。这个资本家听说我要搞技术革新，把脸一沉，恶狠狠地对我说：“我要管好工厂，设备不能随便动用，技术革新要先打报告，要有设计图样，然后算好成本，经过厂部批准，上报公司同意，才准动。否则乱来一通，浪费钞票谁负责？”听他这么一说，我满腔热情被泼冷了一半，无可奈何，只得回去。
    可是过了两天，我无意中发现，我原来要的这台旧设备，已被拆得七零八落，全部扔进了废铁堆。看到了这些，我气得牙齿都格格响，这些家伙不是明明在刁难我们吗？我暗暗下定决心，非得搞出来给他们看看不可！于是我就不管三七二十一，自己动手在废铁堆里七拼八凑，把拆散的零件全部捡回来，在同志们的帮助下，终于改装成功自动圆周割刀机。可是这个混蛋资本家却对此极端仇恨。他和厂里的党内走资本主义道路当权派串通一气，狠狠地骂了我一通，还利用行政名义向全厂通报批评，什么“目无组织，目无领导”，什么“自由散漫，违反制度”等等，莫须有的帽子重重压来，而这个阴险的资本家却似乎成了“坚持原则”的“模范”，简直混蛋透顶！
    在社会主义的企业中，不去揭露资本家的各种阴谋破坏活动，不去和资本主义势力作斗争，却去打击工人阶级建设社会主义的积极性，却去和工人阶级作斗争，这不是资产阶级专政又是什么？
    这就是中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹要资本家“管理工厂”的结果。中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义，妄图实现历史大倒退的滔天罪行，一定要清算！
