The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently being carried out in-depth in our country, is an unprecedentedly great revolutionary mass movement in human history, a triumphant song of communism that resonates through the clouds! This triumphant song was composed by the masses in the billions under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, and thus it is so surging and majestic, inspiring the entire Chinese nation and shaking the entire world.

The great proletarian democracy that has developed in our country during the Cultural Revolution is a great creation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary mass movement. Once it emerged, it demonstrated unparalleled power in destroying the old world and creating the new. For this reason, all revolutionary peoples of the world are thrilled and inspired, while a small handful of imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary forces fear it like a flood or a wild beast, desperately opposing it. In particular, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is in a state of hysteria, screaming and cursing our Cultural Revolution army, armed with the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, as a "bunch of hooligans" and "acting recklessly"! They spread rumors and slander, claiming that the Chinese people have no democracy or freedom, that the Red Guards are "creating a terrifying atmosphere everywhere," and that cadres and residents have suffered a "great disaster"! "The current political life in China is a terrifying and bizarre picture, a gloomy work of fantasy." This is a wonderful picture of a chorus of clowns.

Indeed:

"The small globe has a few flies bumping into the wall.
Buzzing, a few shrill cries, a few sobs."
The enemy is so eager to oppose our proletarian democracy, precisely because our proletarian democracy is too good, excellent!

We not only need to practice proletarian democracy now but also need to correctly use it in the future under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

The unprecedented true great democracy in human history

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy, no abstract freedom and abstract democracy. In a class struggle society, if there is the freedom of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, there is no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, there is no proletarian and laboring people's democracy." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, standing on the bourgeois position, claims that the Chinese people have no democracy or freedom at all, which precisely proves that our proletarian and broad laboring people enjoy an unprecedented true great democracy in human history!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always been the most trusting of the masses, the most understanding of the masses' wishes, the most able to see the great role of the masses, the most skilled in discovering and mobilizing the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity hidden within the masses, and the most respectful of the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, a prominent feature of our party and our country is the emphasis on the masses and the adherence to the mass line in everything. In the past year and more of the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's thorough mass line has been developed to a great extent with epoch-making significance. It is under the guidance of this revolutionary line that in our country, a vigorous revolutionary mass movement has emerged. Billions of revolutionary people have responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, caring about state affairs. They enjoy democratic freedom of speech, assembly, and publication of periodicals; they can freely associate; they can engage in big debates, post big-character posters, and conduct revolutionary tours. Thus, the great creativity hidden among ordinary revolutionary people has erupted like a volcano, burning fiercely, frightening all reactionary forces at home and abroad, and stunning a large number of political mediocrities. Turning over the pages of human civilization history of several thousand years, which dynasty, which country has ever practiced such great democracy? Have capitalist countries? Have revisionist countries? No, absolutely not! Monopoly capitalism and modern revisionism shamelessly sing praises of "democracy" and "freedom" every day, but for the proletariat and the broad laboring people, these are nothing but euphemisms for exploitation, oppression, destruction, and massacre!

In this Cultural Revolution, our country indeed has a small number of people who feel that disaster is imminent, trembling with fear every night, and in constant anxiety. These are the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and ghosts and monsters in society. For such a handful of people, not only is there no small democracy, but there is not even a bit of it! The characteristic of great democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is to exercise dictatorship over a small handful of counter-revolutionary forces and to give full democracy to the broad revolutionary people. Dictatorship over the enemy is precisely to ensure that the people have true democracy. Without a strong proletarian dictatorship as a backing, the proletariat and the broad laboring people cannot even protect their heads, let alone talk about democracy. In the Cultural Revolution, it is precisely because we have exercised ruthless dictatorship over a small handful of counter-revolutionary forces that we have ensured that revolutionary people enjoy true great democracy. Two classes, two democracies, one devouring the other, either you devour me or I devour you, it has always been like this.

Brezhnev and Kosygin shout that the Chinese people have no democracy or freedom, boasting that the Soviet Union has achieved the supposedly most wonderful "true all-people's democracy" in the world today, which can only be appreciated as a fairy tale of the 20th century. Looking back at the ancestors, the so-called "all-people's democracy" turns out to be the resurrection of the corpse of Trotsky's "pure democracy," which has long been denounced by Lenin. Where in the world is there such a monster of "pure democracy" or "all-people's democracy" that does not distinguish between classes? The current reality in the Soviet Union does not even mention this democracy or that democracy, but is a genuine fascist dictatorship and unadulterated white terror. In the great Lenin's hometown, on the Red Square of Moscow, where the blood of the heroes of the October Revolution was shed, today, whoever dares to uphold Marxism-Leninism, dare to speak, dare to struggle, will be surveilled, followed, summoned, or even arrested and imprisoned, or be labeled as a "mental patient" and thrown into the "madhouse," or suddenly "disappear" for no reason... This is the "true all-people's democracy" boasted by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique!

A great achievement of communism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This thing called democracy, sometimes seems to be a goal, but in reality, it is only a means. Marxism tells us that democracy belongs to the superstructure, belongs to the category of politics. This means, in the final analysis, it serves the economic base." The great democracy that has developed in our country during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a means, not a goal. Our goal is to solve the problem of how to ensure that our party and state will never change color and successfully complete the transition to a communist society.

The historical experience of international proletarian dictatorship proves: For the proletariat, seizing power is only the beginning of the revolution, not the end of the revolution. How to continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat? How to prevent capitalist restoration and firmly carry out the socialist revolution to the end in the face of sharp and complex class struggle? This great problem is one that all previous Marxist-Leninists either did not encounter, or did not have time to solve, or were unable to solve. It is precisely the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our brilliant leader Chairman Mao, who has solved this great problem not only in theory and practice but also in method. This method is to carry out a great revolution from the bottom up, that is, great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought.

Such great democracy is a decisive attack on the most dangerous enemies of the proletarian dictatorship—the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, dragging out all the people hidden in the bourgeois command department within the party, thoroughly criticizing and thoroughly overthrowing them, thoroughly uprooting the roots of revisionism, and ensuring that our country advances along the broad road to socialism and communism.

Such great democracy is an unprecedented profound examination and tempering for the broad revolutionary cadres. A handful of bad people have been overthrown, and a large number of good people have been discovered. They have the deepest understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the most resolute implementation, and the most courageous defense. They are the hope of our country. In addition, a number of half-good, half-bad people who were about to slip down have been saved. They have experienced a great shock, immediately pulled themselves back from the brink, and quickly caught up.

Such great democracy is the best classroom for the broad revolutionary people to learn revolution. The people have never been as spirited and enthusiastic as they are now. Their socialist enthusiasm and wisdom have been fully developed. They dare to transform the objective world and are also brave in transforming the subjective world, determined to gradually forge themselves into new people of communism.

In a large country with a vast population, in the current situation of such sharp and complex class struggle both internationally and domestically, to carry out such extensive proletarian great democracy, one needs the great courage and grandeur of a proletarian revolutionary! It proves how strong our proletarian dictatorship is! Would Brezhnev and Kosygin dare to do this? Would other revisionist countries dare to do this? They would not, none of them would. Without proletarian dictatorship, there is no proletarian democracy. In your countries of bourgeois dictatorship, it is impossible and you will never dare to practice any great democracy. If you don't believe it, just try it! You will all fall from your "thrones" within twenty-four hours. Only the greatest proletarian revolutionary who has experienced the longest, most complex, most intense, and most multifaceted tempering in history, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, only the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the unique Great Wall of the People's Liberation Army of China, and with the unshakable proletarian dictatorship of China, dare to make such a great decision and boldly shoulder this historical burden. Chairman Mao personally decided to publish the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster nationwide, Chairman Mao enthusiastically supported the Red Guards who had just emerged, Chairman Mao personally received more than ten million cultural revolutionaries... He always issues timely and wise instructions at the most critical moments, pushing the Cultural Revolution to develop to higher stages, keeping the millions of cultural revolutionaries in a state of high revolutionary enthusiasm. Proletarian great democracy has developed the mass line of our party and the Marxist-Leninist theory of the people creating history to new heights. Proletarian great democracy is Chairman Mao's great creation of how to carry out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a great contribution of Chairman Mao to Marxism-Leninism, and an unprecedented great achievement of socialism and communism! All revolutionary peoples of the world are delighted to see that after undergoing this great movement, the Communist Party of China, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, is more united and stronger than ever; as a beacon of the international communist movement, it is shining more brilliantly than ever! All revolutionary peoples of the world firmly believe that the existence of New China is the hope of the whole world; China's today is the world's tomorrow; the struggle of the Chinese people has opened up a bright road to communism for the peoples of the world!

The triumphant song of communism and the death knell of revisionism

The various slanders and defamations of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique against our proletarian great democracy only prove that it is in a state of extreme fear. The proletarian great democracy that has developed in our country during the Cultural Revolution has long since gone beyond the influence of one country and has sounded the death knell of international revisionism.

Listen to the confession of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique:

"The situation in China indeed not only affects this country but also affects the entire world socialist movement, affecting all communists... This fact cannot but cause understandable concern."

Why should the "situation" that occurred on Chinese soil cause "concern" in a small group of people in Moscow, and moreover, it is "understandable"?

Exactly one hundred years ago, Marx wrote in the preface to the first edition of "Capital": "The special nature of the materials studied by political economy will summon to the battlefield the most violent, most base, and most evil sentiments in the human heart, the demon of private interests." It is precisely so. The proletarian great democracy that has developed in our country during the Cultural Revolution is like a shining sword that mercilessly exposes the dark curtain of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's rule and persecution of the Soviet people, thus provoking the "most base and most evil sentiments" of this group of tyrants to scream and resist. Once the dark curtain is lifted, people clearly see that in China, the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are only a handful and have never occupied the ruling position; in the Soviet Union, since Khrushchev came to power, a privileged stratum has already formed, ruling over the laboring people. This privileged stratum plunders the labor results of the Soviet people, possessing income tens of times or even hundreds of times higher than that of ordinary Soviet workers and peasants. They cruelly persecute the people politically, exploit the people economically, and poison the people ideologically with decadent culture. It is they who have thrown the great Soviet proletariat and laboring people, who had established great achievements for the international communist movement under Lenin's guidance and Stalin's leadership, back into the dark abyss of suffering. The proletarian great democracy has risen in our country, and the eyes of hundreds of millions of people have been further enlightened, and the traitorous faces of the Soviet revisionist clique have been further exposed. This small group of people are panicked, desperate, and thus "naturally" fall into the "concern" of being unable to end the day.

Exactly fifty years ago, a cannon shot from the "Aurora" cruiser announced the beginning of a great new era in human history, and the proletarians and revolutionary peoples of the whole world felt so inspired and encouraged! While all the imperialists and reactionary forces in the world gnashed their teeth in fury, even launching armed interventions, trying to strangle the Soviet in its cradle. Why? Because the Russian proletariat had set a brilliant example for all the starving and freezing slaves in the world, and the October Revolution had pronounced the death sentence on the capitalist system. Stalin wrote: "Now it is no longer possible to regard the laboring masses of the world as a 'blind crowd' wandering in the dark, for the October Revolution has established a lighthouse for them, illuminating the road and pointing the way forward." Similarly, the great democracy that has developed in our country during the Cultural Revolution provides a road for the broad Soviet people of the great birthplace of the October Revolution to liberate their motherland from dark rule once again. With a thunderous roar, the Chinese Khrushchev has fallen in the general offensive of tens of millions of cultural revolutionaries! The Soviet people are so happy! They have seen with their own eyes that revisionism is nothing but a paper tiger. As long as tens of millions of people unite under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, display the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse," and carry out a great revolution from the bottom up, the fate of socialism and the fate of the motherland can be firmly grasped in their own hands. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is so terrified! The fall of the Chinese Khrushchev is a harbinger of their impending doom, and they naturally become more panicked and desperate, thus "naturally" falling into the "concern" of being unable to end the day.

It should be clearly told to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and warned to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like: Your estimate is wrong again! The "situation" in China "naturally" causes not your "concern" but your doom!

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, the revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably be victorious."

The doomsday of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is approaching. The day when the Soviet people thoroughly carry out a great revolution from the bottom up will be the day of the doom of this traitor clique. At that time, the people of the world will see that the red star on the Kremlin, which has lost its luster, will shine brightly again!

    无产阶级大民主就是好！
    ——驳斥苏修叛徒集团对我国无产阶级大民主的污蔑		丁学雷
    正在深入进行的我国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上空前伟大的革命群众运动，是响彻云霄的共产主义凯歌！这首凯歌是在无产阶级专政的条件下，在毛泽东思想的统帅下，亿万群众用大民主的方式谱写出来的，因而显得如此汹涌澎湃、威武雄壮，它振奋了全中国，震撼了全世界。
    我国在文化大革命中充分发展起来的无产阶级大民主，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想和革命的群众运动相结合的伟大创造，它一经出世，就在摧毁旧世界、创造新世界方面表现了无可匹敌的威力。正因为这样，全世界革命人民无不为之欢欣鼓舞，而一小撮帝、修、反反动势力惧之犹如洪水猛兽，拚死命地反对。尤其是苏修叛徒集团，他们歇斯底里大发作，破口大骂我们用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的文化革命大军是什么“一群流氓”、“胡作非为”！他们造谣污蔑，胡说什么中国人民已经享受不到一点民主自由，红卫兵“到处制造恐怖气氛”，干部和居民遭到了“大灾难”！“当前中国的政治生活是一幅可怕的古怪画、阴郁的幻想作品”。这是一幅极妙的群丑悲鸣图。
    正是：“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”敌人如此起劲地反对我们的无产阶级大民主，恰恰证明我们的无产阶级大民主太好了，好极了！我们不仅现在要搞无产阶级大民主，今后也要正确地运用在无产阶级专政条件下的大民主。
  人类历史上空前未有的真正大民主
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”苏修叛徒集团，站在资产阶级立场上，硬说中国人民享受不到一点民主自由，这恰恰证明我国无产阶级和广大劳动人民享有人类历史上空前未有的真正大民主！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席从来是最相信群众，最了解群众的心愿，最能看到群众的伟大作用，最善于发现和调动群众中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的革命积极性和创造力，最尊重群众的革命首创精神。在毛主席的领导下，我们党我们国家的一个显著特点，就是突出群众，一切走群众路线。在一年多来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席的彻底的群众路线得到了具有划时代意义的伟大发展。就在这条革命路线的指引下，在我国，出现了生气蓬勃的革命群众运动。亿万革命人民，纷纷起来响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，关心国家大事。他们享有言论上的民主，集会游行的民主，出版刊物的民主，自由结社的民主；可以大鸣大放大辩论，可以贴大字报，可以进行革命大串连。于是，蕴藏在普通革命人民中间伟大的创造力，犹如火山爆发，一下子烈焰熊熊地迸发了出来，吓死了中外一切反动势力，吓呆了一大批政治庸人。翻开人类几千年的文明史，哪一个朝代，哪一个国家实行过这样的大民主？资本主义国家有吗？修正主义国家有吗？没有，绝对没有！垄断资本主义和现代修正主义恬不知耻地天天在那里高唱“民主”、“自由”的赞美诗，但对无产阶级和广大劳动人民来说，不过是遭受剥削、压迫、摧残和屠杀的代名词！
    在这次文化大革命中，我国确实有一小部分人感到大难临头，夜夜心惊肉跳，惶惶不可终日。这就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，社会上的地、富、反、坏、右、牛鬼蛇神。对这样一小撮人，莫说大民主，连小民主也一点不给，半点不给！无产阶级专政条件下大民主的特点，就是对一小撮反革命势力实行专政，给广大革命人民以充分民主。对敌人的专政，正是为了让人民有真正的民主。没有强大的无产阶级专政做靠山，无产阶级和广大劳动人民连脑袋也保不住了，还谈得上什么民主。在文化大革命中，正是因为我们对一小撮反革命势力进行了无情的专政，才保证了革命人民享有真正的大民主。两个阶级，两种民主，一个吃掉一个，不是你吃掉我，便是我吃掉你，从来都是如此。
    勃列日涅夫和柯西金老爷大叫中国人民享受不到一点民主自由，吹嘘苏联实现了据说是当今世界上最美妙的“真正的全民民主”，这只能当作二十世纪的天方夜谭来欣赏。查一查老祖宗，所谓的全民牌“民主”，原来就是早已被列宁批臭了的托洛茨基的“纯粹民主”这具僵尸的复活。世界上哪里有不分阶级的“纯粹民主”或“全民民主”这个怪物呢？当前苏联的现实，根本谈不上这个民主，那个民主，而是地地道道的法西斯专政，不折不扣的白色恐怖。在伟大列宁的故乡，在洒满了十月革命英雄鲜血的莫斯科红场上，今天，谁要是敢于坚持马克思列宁主义，敢于说话，敢于斗争，谁就会被监视、盯梢、传讯以至逮捕和监禁，或者硬被说成是“精神病患者”而被抛进“疯人院”，或是莫名其妙地忽然“失踪”……这就是苏修叛徒集团所吹嘘的“真正的全民民主”！
        共产主义的伟大创举
    毛主席教导我们说：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。马克思主义告诉我们，民主属于上层建筑，属于政治这个范畴。这就是说，归根结蒂，它是为经济基础服务的。”我国在无产阶级文化大革命中充分发展起来的大民主，也是一种手段，不是目的。我们的目的是要解决怎样保证我们的党和国家永不变色，胜利地完成向共产主义社会过渡这样一个大问题。
    国际无产阶级专政的历史经验证明：对于无产阶级说来，夺取政权只是革命的开始，而不是革命的终结。在无产阶级专政下如何继续进行革命？如何在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中防止资本主义复辟、坚持把社会主义革命进行到底？这个大问题，是所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者，或者没有遇到过，或者没有来得及解决，或者没有能够解决的。正是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们天才的领袖毛主席，不仅从理论上、实践上，也从方法上解决了这个大问题。这个方法，就是实行自下而上的大革命，就是无产阶级专政条件下、毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主。
    这样的大民主，对无产阶级政权最危险的敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是一次歼灭性的总攻击，把他们隐蔽地设置在党内的资产阶级司令部里的人统统揪出来，彻底批臭，彻底打倒，彻底挖掉修正主义根子，保证我国沿着社会主义、共产主义康庄大道前进。
    这样的大民主，对广大革命干部是一次空前深刻的大审查，大锻炼。打倒了一小撮坏人，发现了一大批好人。他们对毛主席的革命路线领会最深刻，贯彻最坚决，捍卫最勇敢。他们是我们国家的希望所在。除此以外，还挽救了一批半好半坏、差一点要滑下去的人。他们受了一次大震动，立即悬崖勒马，迅速赶了上来。
    这样的大民主，对广大革命人民是一个学习革命最好的大课堂。人民群众从来没有象现在这样意气风发、斗志昂扬，他们的社会主义积极性，他们的聪明才智，得到了最充分的发扬。他们敢于改造客观世界，也勇于改造主观世界，决心把自己逐步锻炼成为共产主义新人。
    在一个人口众多的大国里，在当前国际国内阶级斗争如此尖锐复杂的形势下，实行这样广泛的无产阶级大民主，需要有多么伟大的无产阶级革命家的胆略和气魄啊！证明了我们无产阶级专政是多么强大啊！勃列日涅夫、柯西金敢这样做吗？其他修正主义国家敢这样做吗？不敢，都不敢。没有无产阶级专政便没有无产阶级民主。在你们这些资产阶级专政的国家里，根本不可能也永远不敢搞什么大民主。不信，就请你们试试吧！保险不到二十四小时，就都一个一个从“宝座”上掉下来。只有在历史上经历了最长期最复杂最激烈最多方面锻炼的伟大的无产阶级革命家、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，有了举世无双的中国人民解放军这样的伟大长城，有了坚如磐石的中国无产阶级政权，才敢于下这样大的决心，勇于挑起这副历史的重担。毛主席亲自决定发表全国第一张马列主义大字报，毛主席用最大的热情支持了刚刚出现的红卫兵，毛主席先后亲自接见了一千多万文化革命大军……他老人家总是在最关键时刻最及时发出英明指示，推动文化大革命不断向更高阶段发展，使亿万文化大军始终处于高昂的革命激情之中。无产阶级大民主把我们党的群众路线，把马克思列宁主义关于人民群众创造历史的理论发展到新的高峰。无产阶级大民主是毛主席解决如何在无产阶级专政下进行革命的一个伟大创造，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义又一伟大贡献，是社会主义、共产主义一个空前伟大的创举！全世界革命人民都高兴地看到，经受了这次伟大运动的严峻考验，以毛泽东思想为指南的中国共产党，空前团结，空前壮大；作为国际共产主义运动的灯塔，正在发出更加灿烂的光芒！全世界革命人民坚信，新中国的存在，是全世界的希望；中国的今天，就是世界的明天；中国人民的斗争，为世界人民开辟了一条通向共产主义的光明大道！	  共产主义的凯歌和修正主义的丧钟
    苏修叛徒集团对我国无产阶级大民主的种种诽谤、污蔑，只能证明它正处在极度恐惧之中。我国在文化大革命中发展起来的无产阶级大民主，早已远远超出了一国的影响，敲响了国际上修正主义的丧钟。
    请听苏修叛徒集团的供词：
    “中国的事态确实不只涉及到这个国家，而且涉及到整个世界社会主义，涉及到所有共产党人……这一事实不能不引起理所当然的忧虑。”
    发生在中国大地上的“事态”，何以会引起莫斯科一小撮人的“忧虑”，而且又是“理所当然”的呢？
    整整一百年前，马克思为《资本论》作初版序言的时候写道：“政治经济学所研究的材料的特殊性质，会把人心中最激烈最卑鄙最恶劣的感情，代表私人利益的仇神，召唤到战场上来反对它。”正是这样，我国在文化大革命中发展起来的无产阶级大民主，象是一柄闪光的利剑，无情地揭开了苏修叛徒集团统治、迫害苏联人民的黑幕，因而激起了这一撮暴君“最卑鄙最恶劣的感情”的叫骂和反抗。黑幕一揭开，人们清楚地看到，在中国，党内走资本主义道路当权派还只是一小撮，从来没有占据过统治地位；在苏联，自从赫鲁晓夫上台后，就已经形成一个特权阶层，骑在劳动人民头上作威作福。这个特权阶层，侵吞苏联人民的劳动成果，占有远比苏联一般工人和农民高过几十倍甚至上百倍的收入。他们政治上残酷地迫害人民，经济上敲骨吸髓地剥削人民，思想上用腐朽的文化毒害人民，就是他们，把曾经在列宁的教导下和斯大林的领导下为国际共产主义运动建立了丰功伟绩的伟大的苏联无产阶级和劳动人民，又抛入了暗无天日的苦难深渊。我国无产阶级大民主起来了，亿万人民的眼睛进一步擦亮了，苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸进一步暴露出来了，这一小撮人惊慌了，绝望了，于是便“理所当然”地堕入了惶惶不可终日的“忧虑”。
    整整五十年前，“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰上一声炮响，宣告了人类历史上一个伟大的新纪元的开始，全世界无产者和革命人民感到多么振奋和鼓舞啊！而全世界帝国主义和一切反动势力都咬牙切齿地发狂叫骂，甚至发动武装干涉，企图把苏维埃扼死在摇篮之中。为什么？就因为俄国无产阶级为全世界饥寒交迫的奴隶做出了光辉的榜样，十月革命宣判了资本主义制度的死刑。斯大林写道：“现在已经不能再把世界劳动群众看做在黑暗中徘徊的前途茫然的‘盲目人群’了，因为十月革命给他们建立了一座照耀道路并指出前途的灯塔。”同样，我国在文化大革命中发展起来的大民主，为伟大的十月革命发源地的广大苏联人民，提供了一条重新把祖国从黑暗统治下解放出来的道路。轰然一声，中国的赫鲁晓夫在亿万文化大军的总攻战中倒台了！苏联人民多么高兴呵！他们亲眼看到，修正主义也不过是纸老虎，只要亿万群众在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的旗帜下联合起来，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命大无畏精神，自下而上地来一个大革命，社会主义的命运，祖国前途的命运，完全可以紧紧地掌握在自己手里。苏修叛徒集团多么恐慌呵！唇亡齿寒，兔死狐悲，中国赫鲁晓夫的倒台，对他们来说，就是自己行将遭受灭顶之灾的预兆，他们自然要更加惊慌了，更加绝望了，于是便“理所当然”地更加堕入了惶惶不可终日的“忧虑”。
    应当明白地告诉苏修叛徒集团，警告勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流：你们的估计又错了！中国大地上的“事态”，“理所当然”地引起的不是你们的“忧虑”，而是你们的灭亡！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说道：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    苏修叛徒集团的末日即将来临了，苏联人民彻底实行自下而上的大革命之日，就是这个叛徒集团灭亡之时。到那时，世界人民将看到，克里姆林宫上已经失去了光泽的红星将重新放射出夺目的光辉！
