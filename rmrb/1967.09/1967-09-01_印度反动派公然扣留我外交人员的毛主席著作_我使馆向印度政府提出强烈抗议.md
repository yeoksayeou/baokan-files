Indian reactionaries brazenly detained Mao Zedong's works belonging to our diplomatic personnel. Our embassy lodges a strong protest with the Indian government.

New Delhi, August 31 (Xinhua) - The Chinese Embassy in India's acting charge d'affaires, Chen Shaoyuan, on August 26 handed over a note of protest to the Indian reactionary government regarding the Indian customs' detention of Mao Zedong's works carried by Chinese embassy personnel. The note strongly protested the Indian reactionary government's new anti-China crime of blatantly violating international norms and attempting to deprive our diplomatic personnel of their sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

The note pointed out that since the Indian authorities detained the Mao Zedong works of Chinese diplomatic personnel, the Chinese Embassy has repeatedly lodged representations with the Indian authorities. However, the Indian authorities have not provided any justification and continue to refuse to return the items. This brazen and unreasonable behavior blatantly violates international norms and customs, seriously affecting the study and work of Chinese diplomatic personnel.

The note also pointed out that the Indian reactionary government's continuous creation of anti-China incidents is not accidental. For a long time, especially since the beginning of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Indian government has been terrified and enraged by the Indian people's love for Mao Zedong Thought. The Indian government, in order to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and to maintain its shaky reactionary rule, has repeatedly staged anti-China farces, attempting to obstruct the Indian people from learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of China's Cultural Revolution. Now, it has gone so far as to attempt to deprive and interfere with the sacred and inviolable right of Chinese diplomatic personnel to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. This fully exposes the reactionary nature and ugly face of the Indian government.

The note emphasized that the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is irresistible. All the social dregs that obstruct the progress of history will ultimately be crushed by the wheels of history.

The note finally demands that the Indian authorities immediately return all the Mao Zedong works and other books belonging to Chinese diplomatic personnel and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again.

　　印度反动派公然扣留我外交人员的毛主席著作
    我使馆向印度政府提出强烈抗议
    新华社三十一日讯　新德里消息：中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源二十六日就印度海关扣留中国大使馆人员携带的毛主席著作事向印度反动政府递交一份抗议照会，强烈抗议印度反动政府不顾国际关系准则，妄图剥夺我国外交人员学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利的新的反华罪行。照会指出，这是印度反动政府对伟大的七亿中国人民的又一次严重挑衅。
    照会指出，自从印度政府当局扣留中国外交人员的毛主席著作以后，中国大使馆曾经多次向印度当局提出交涉，但是印度当局提不出任何理由，仍然拒绝归还。这种粗暴无理的行径明目张胆地破坏了国际关系准则和国际惯例，严重影响了中国外交人员的学习和工作。
    照会还指出，印度反动政府连续制造反华事件绝不是偶然的。长期以来，特别是中国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，印度政府对印度人民热爱毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命。印度政府为了适应美帝、苏修的需要，为了维持自己摇摇欲坠的反动统治，不惜出卖印度人民的利益，再三制造反华丑剧，妄图以此来阻止印度人民学习和运用毛泽东思想和中国文化大革命的影响。现在，它又进而妄图剥夺、干预中国外交人员学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣不可侵犯的权利。这正暴露了印度政府的反动本质和丑恶嘴脸。
    照会强调说，光焰无际的毛泽东思想是不可阻挡的。一切阻挡历史前进的社会渣滓到头来只会被历史车轮辗得粉碎。
    照会最后要求印度当局立即如数归还中国外交人员的毛主席著作等书籍，并保证不再发生类似事件。
