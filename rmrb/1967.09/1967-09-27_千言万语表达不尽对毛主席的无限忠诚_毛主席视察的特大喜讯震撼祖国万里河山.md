Words cannot express the boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. The tremendous news of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Cultural Revolution shakes the entire country.

September 26, Beijing: The joyous news that our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao has inspected the Cultural Revolution in North China, Central China, and East China has electrified the entire nation. The news has reverberated across the country like a thunderclap, greatly inspiring the revolutionary masses and people of all ethnic groups nationwide. Today, from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall, millions of revolutionary masses continue to hold grand rallies, parades, and various celebrations. The revolutionary masses shout in unison: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The revolutionary masses across the country unanimously vow: Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will achieve revolutionary unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. We will further carry out revolutionary criticism, improve our units through struggle, criticism, and transformation, implement the "three-in-one combination," consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary masses in the capital say: Last year, Chairman Mao received the Red Guards in Beijing eight times, and this year, he personally inspected North China, Central China, and East China. Our great leader trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most, always keeping his heart connected with the masses. Wherever he points, we will strike. We must redouble our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, step by step following his great strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The railway workers in Beijing, who have already achieved revolutionary unity, proudly declare that we will unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, further carry out revolutionary criticism and unit struggle, criticism, and transformation, seize the revolution, and promote production to ensure the completion of railway transportation tasks.

The revolutionary masses and Red Guards in provinces and cities such as Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, where Chairman Mao has personally inspected, are immersed in boundless joy and happiness. In the central plains, along the Yangtze River, at the foot of Jinggang Mountain, and by the Huangpu River, red flags flutter, drums beat, and people sing and dance, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!" They say, Chairman Mao came to inspect the Cultural Revolution in our area, which has given us boundless strength. We must follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and strive for new victories in the Cultural Revolution!

Following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers in Shanghai's Zhabei District, who have quickly achieved revolutionary unity, on the day the tremendous news of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Cultural Revolution was announced, together with revolutionary cadres from various industries, formed the Zhabei District Revolutionary Committee after discussions and research. Many revolutionary workers excitedly say, following Chairman Mao means victory! The railway and coal mine workers in Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xinxiang, Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Hebi in Henan Province, while celebrating Chairman Mao's inspection of Henan, held up banners of revolutionary unity to report the good news to Chairman Mao. They declare that in the future, they will unite as one, jointly carry out revolutionary unity and unit struggle, criticism, and transformation, seize the revolution, and promote production to create new achievements for the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants in the revolutionary cradle of Jinggang Mountain and the revolutionary base areas of Xingguo and Rujin in Jiangxi Province have held grand celebrations in recent days. The people excitedly say, in the past, Chairman Mao ignited the flames of revolution on Jinggang Mountain, leading us to establish a proletarian heaven; today, to ensure that our proletarian iron heaven remains unchanged, Chairman Mao has personally initiated and led the unprecedented Cultural Revolution. We must let the red flag raised by Chairman Mao fly high forever on the red land!

The revolutionary masses and people of all ethnic groups in Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Qinghai continue to hold large-scale celebrations, parades, symposiums, and other activities today, enthusiastically welcoming Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China amid the unprecedented good situation of the Cultural Revolution. The chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, Liu Geping, said at the celebration: The revolutionary masses of Shanxi will definitely print Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds and implement them in action, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the high tide of revolutionary criticism and unity, and be the vanguard of revolutionary unity and the model of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary masses of the Qingdao and Jinan divisions of the Jinan Railway Bureau and the stations along the line have achieved revolutionary unity. They declare: We railway workers will definitely prioritize revolutionary and national interests, firmly guard our posts, seize the revolution, and promote production, reporting our revolutionary and production achievements to Chairman Mao!

The revolutionary masses in Tianjin, Baoding, Hohhot, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Urumqi, Changchun, Anshan, Yanji, Nanjing, Hefei, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanning, Guilin, Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Lhasa have held meetings, parades, and symposiums in the past two days, expressing their determination: Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever advancing along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses of Anshan Steel Company, Baotou Steel Company, and Tianjin Steel Plant, who have achieved new victories in revolution and production, immediately held lively discussions in the workshops and by the steel furnaces upon hearing the news. The steel workers declare that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidate revolutionary unity in thought, and achieve new victories in revolution and production, reporting to Chairman Mao and presenting gifts for National Day.

September 26, Beijing: "Closely follow the great strategic deployment of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, and achieve new victories in revolutionary criticism and unity." This is the most resounding vow made by the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in recent days as they enthusiastically welcome the tremendous news of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Cultural Revolution in North China, Central China, and East China.

The revolutionary masses of the Chemical Defense, Artillery, Engineering, Communications, and Railway Corps in Beijing and their subordinate units held celebration meetings, holding high the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," facing Chairman Mao's portrait, and solemnly vowing: Revolutionary soldiers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will definitely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, further carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job of "three supports, two militaries," and "love the people" work, and carry out war preparedness work solidly. The revolutionary masses of the Artillery Corps in Beijing also collectively decided to turn the battlefield of revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party into a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning and using them in the struggle, achieving new levels of learning and use, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, building the Artillery Corps into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The tremendous news of Chairman Mao's return to Beijing reached the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," and the soldiers and officers who are fighting alongside the revolutionary masses were extremely excited, with countless words converging into the strongest call to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They say, Chairman Mao's deep involvement with the masses, personal inspection, and investigation of the Cultural Revolution situation are the greatest care, encouragement, and motivation for us. We must take Chairman Mao's great practice as an example, always keep our hearts connected with the revolutionary masses, and vow to be the promoters of revolutionary unity, the vanguard of revolutionary criticism, and the models of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and "love the people." The soldiers and officers of the units executing support-left tasks in Zhejiang, upon hearing the news, were all overjoyed, with everyone's heart blooming with joy, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in Hangzhou, together with the revolutionary workers of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau, jointly declared that they will use their good work in railway transportation to respond to Chairman Mao's greatest care for Zhejiang's Cultural Revolution. In Poyang Lake and along the Ganjiang River, the soldiers and officers of the 6th Company, 4th Platoon of the 601st Division, who were praised as "support-left and love-the-people models" for protecting the safety of the Red Guards with their lives, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, collectively vowing: Chairman Mao, we promise you that in the current struggle of revolutionary criticism and unity, we will unswervingly follow your great strategic deployment, do an even better job of support-left work, and create new achievements for the people!

In recent days, many soldiers and officers of the "three supports, two militaries" units have also formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into factories, rural areas, and schools to spread the tremendous news of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Cultural Revolution. The propaganda team active in the Anshan area turned this tremendous news into poems, singing and spreading it everywhere. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain "four-good" squadron of the Air Force in Lanzhou brought this news to the production brigades engaged in the "three autumns" production, greatly inspiring the commune members, significantly speeding up the autumn harvest progress, and making the "six-goods" even more solid.

The border guards on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, have been listening to the tremendous news of Chairman Mao's return to Beijing. They say, border guards love Chairman Mao the most, miss Chairman Mao the most, and sincerely wish our most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Recently, in the struggle to defend the border, the soldiers who smashed the armed provocations of Indian invaders were so excited that they stayed up all night, their joyous hearts seeming to fly to Beijing, to Chairman Mao's side. They declare that they will heighten their vigilance a thousand times, better seize the revolution and war preparedness, and fiercely strike and annihilate any invading aggressors, vowing to be the iron Great Wall defending the Cultural Revolution.
