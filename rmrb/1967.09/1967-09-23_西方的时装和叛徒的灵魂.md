More than twenty years ago, the famous Soviet writer Gorky once denounced American monopoly capitalism's civilization as "the most hideous civilization on our planet." Yet, more than twenty years later, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, this "most hideous civilization" has sprouted like mold, spreading a stench of decay everywhere. The recent "International Fashion Exhibition" and "International Fashion Show" held in Moscow are a most hideous performance of this "most hideous civilization."

In a period of over half a month, more than a thousand fashion companies from over twenty countries, including the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, and Japan, exhibited a large number of bizarre Western garments. There were evening gowns that exposed the chest and back, "mini-skirts" that hung at the knees, coats as wide as sacks, and pants as tight as chicken legs, etc. The shapes were grotesque and varied. The Soviet revisionist press, radio, television, and cinemas loudly praised these decadent bourgeois goods, making the entire Moscow chaotic and foul-smelling.

The Soviet revisionist nouveaux riches are so enthusiastic about appreciating and promoting these bizarre Western garments, reflecting their ugly souls and bourgeois nature. People's clothing styles not only change with the times but also differ according to class. Engels once said: "The working class has a different set of habits, thoughts, and ideas, customs, and moral principles... They are so different from each other that it is as if they belong to different races."

During the years of the October Revolution, the combat uniforms of the Petrograd Red Guards represented the image of the revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers. During the difficult years of building the Magnitogorsk Steel Plant and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the work clothes of the Soviet working class were a symbol of Soviet socialist construction. But today, the bizarre garments imported from the West by the privileged classes in Moscow are a mark of the degeneration of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and also evidence of their crime of promoting "peaceful evolution" and restoring capitalism. A certain way of life is always linked to a certain economic base and a certain political system. Since the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has politically degenerated into the servants of imperialism, they will inevitably bow down to the Western bourgeois lifestyle, using Western lifestyles to corrupt and poison the Soviet people, as a tool for carrying out the restoration of capitalism.

Those who opened the door to Western lifestyles are none other than the Soviet revisionist leaders who have usurped the Kremlin throne. People remember that shortly after Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, the West German "World Newspaper" wrote: In the Soviet Union, "there has never been a party leader as fashionable as Brezhnev," who "wears a silver-gray tie, a flawless, finely made black suit, and is so meticulously dressed that he doesn't even think about Lenin's attire."

However, the more those high-ranking officials and ladies in Moscow flaunt their fashionable Western attire to show off their trendiness, wealth, and "nobility," the more they reveal the filth and baseness of their souls and the ugliness of their traitorous faces. When these "fat and comfortable communists," as described by the British Conservative Party leader Home, wear the latest Italian fashions, drink French Martinis, and dance to the "Cha-Cha-Cha" popular in the United States, do they still think of the warriors in the jungles of South Vietnam, the starving villagers in India, and the black people in New York's Harlem?! These traitors, who are not afraid to trade the interests of the world's revolutionary people with the executioners of Washington, helping American imperialism delay its doom, is it not precisely because they fear that the revolutionary flames will also burn down their revisionist little court's nest of comfort?

However, history is always progressing. "The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod, the jade sky clears the ten-thousand-mile dust." In the homeland of the October Revolution, one day, the revolutionary surging waves will rise again, sweeping away this group of clowns and their bizarre garments that have polluted the Soviet land!

### 西方的时装和叛徒的灵魂

　　西方的时装和叛徒的灵魂
    二十多年前，苏联著名作家高尔基曾经把美国垄断资本主义的文明斥为“我们星球上最丑恶的文明”。可是，二十多年后的今天，在苏修集团统治下的苏联，这种“最丑恶的文明”，却象霉菌一样滋长起来，到处散发出腐烂的臭味。最近在莫斯科举行的所谓“国际服装展览会”和“国际时装表演会”，就是这种“最丑恶的文明”的一场最丑恶的表演。
    在为期半个多月的时间里，美国、英国、法国、西德、意大利、日本等二十多个国家的一千多家服装公司展出了大量的西方奇装异服。什么袒胸露背的晚礼服啊，吊在膝盖上的“超短女裙”啊，什么宽得象麻袋似的外套啊，紧得象鸡腿似的长裤啊，等等，真是妖形怪状，五花八门。苏修的报刊、电台、电视和电影院居然大吹大擂地宣扬这些腐朽没落的资产阶级货色，把整个莫斯科闹得乌烟瘴气，臭不可闻。
    苏修新贵们这样狂热地欣赏和推销西方的奇装异服，反映了他们的丑恶灵魂和资产阶级本性。人的服式，不但因时代的变异而变异，而且也因阶级的不同而不同。恩格斯曾经说过：“工人阶级比起资产阶级来，说的是另一种习惯语，有另一套思想和观念，另一套习俗和道德原则……他们彼此是这样地不相同，就好象他们是属于不同的种族一样。”
    在十月革命的烽火年月里，彼得格勒赤卫队的战斗服装代表了革命的工农兵的形象。在建设马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂和第聂伯水电站的艰难岁月里，苏联工人阶级的劳动服装是苏联社会主义建设的象征。而今天莫斯科那些特权阶级从西方贩卖来的奇装异服，则是苏修统治集团堕落的一种标记，也是他们推行“和平演变”和复辟资本主义的一个罪证。一定的生活方式总跟一定的经济基础和一定的政治制度相联系的。苏修叛徒集团既然在政治上堕落成为帝国主义的奴仆，他们就必然会在生活方式上拜倒在西方资产阶级的脚下，利用西方生活方式来腐蚀和毒害苏联人民群众，作为实行资本主义复辟的工具。
    为西方生活方式大开门户的不是别人，正是那些窃据着克里姆林宫宝座的苏修头目们。人们记得，当勃列日涅夫和柯西金上台不久的时候，西德《世界报》就写道：在苏联，“从来没有象勃列日涅夫这样时髦的党的首脑”，他“系着银灰色的领带，穿着无懈可击、精工巧制的黑色西服，他穿戴得这样考究，对列宁的装束根本连想都不想了”。
    可是，莫斯科那些达官贵人、老爷太太们愈是用西方的服饰来炫耀自己的时髦、阔绰和“高贵”，就愈显得自己的灵魂的肮脏卑鄙，愈暴露出自己的叛徒嘴脸的丑恶。当这些被英国保守党头子霍姆称为“肥胖和舒适的共产党人”穿着意大利式的时新服装，喝着法国的马蒂尼酒，踏着风靡美国的“查，查，查”舞步时，他们的心里那儿还想得到南越丛林中的战士，印度乡村中的饥民和纽约哈莱姆区的黑人？！这些叛徒们之所以不惜拿世界革命人民的利益来同华盛顿的刽子手做交易，帮助美帝国主义延缓自己的末日的到来，难道不正是因为害怕革命的烈火也将把他们的修正主义小朝廷的安乐窝付之一炬吗？
    然而，历史总是前进的。“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在十月革命的故乡，终有一天，会重新卷起革命的滚滚怒涛，把玷污苏维埃大地的这一群跳梁小丑连同他们那些乌七八糟的奇装异服荡涤干净！
