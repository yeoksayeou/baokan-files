	China's Khrushchev is our mortal enemy
	Jiā Chéngràng

	The biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, at a time when our country's economy is temporarily facing difficulties, breathes in the same direction as the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries abroad, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists at home, spreading a black wind of capitalism and revisionism. "Three Freedoms and One Contract" is a big black commodity he personally concocted, an iron-clad proof of his conspiracy to restore capitalism.

	Who loves and supports "Three Freedoms and One Contract" the most? Who hates and opposes it the most? We poor and lower-middle peasants know best and have the right to speak.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." After the liberation of Dazhai in 1945, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's wise instructions and organized themselves to take the road of collectivization. Over the past twenty-two years, we have been walking this road, and it has become wider and more promising with each step, and more prosperous with each passing year.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have deeply felt from their own experiences: Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao; everything is good, but not as good as socialism. In the old society, Dazhai Village was poor, the land was poor, and the people were poor. At that time, 60% of the land in the entire village belonged to landlords and rich peasants, and most of the few oxen were also in their pens. The poor brothers worked hard all year round, but they couldn't eat their fill or keep warm. After liberation, we took the road of socialist collectivization, and production developed faster each year, changes were greater each year, and life was better each year. From the initial agricultural cooperatives in 1953 to now, grain yield per mu and total yield have increased every year. In the first year of establishing the initial cooperative, the average yield per mu was 240 jin, which was double that of the individual farming period. By 1958, when the people's communes were established, the average yield per mu increased to 542 jin, more than double that of the initial cooperative. After the establishment of the people's communes, production developed even faster. By 1962, the yield per mu reached 774 jin. In 1963, although we suffered a once-in-a-century flood disaster, after a year of recovery, the yield per mu in 1964 increased to 809 jin. In 1966, although Dazhai suffered from five disasters—water, drought, wind, hail, and pests—we still achieved a bumper harvest. Calculated by the area with harvest, the yield per mu reached over 820 jin. This year, Dazhai's summer grain crops achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in history, with the yield per mu doubling compared to last year. All of this fully proves that only by taking the road of collectivization is the correct and bright path. With the development of the collective economy, not only has Dazhai undergone earth-shaking changes, but the vast rural areas of the country are also rapidly changing their backward faces of "poverty and blankness."

	"The enemy will not be eliminated by itself." Our victory has aroused the hatred of the class enemies. The biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party hates the great changes in our rural areas to the core. He stubbornly stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, wearing the same pants and singing the same tune as the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, vigorously promoting the "Three Freedoms and One Contract" black commodity, claiming that only "contracting production to households" can promote production development, shouting that "free markets must still be operated," "even if new bourgeois elements emerge, it is not to be feared," "do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," and so on. Pfft! China's Khrushchev, you are indeed audacious and extremely reactionary. You openly call for the restoration of capitalism, attempting to drag us back to the old society, to make us slaves to the landlords again, to suffer twice, this is completely a pipe dream, a foolish fantasy!

	Where there is stench, flies swarm. When the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party spread this "Three Freedoms and One Contract" evil wind, the landlords and rich peasants in Dazhai also stirred. They engaged in free trade and speculation, attempting to dismantle the collective economy and undermine the foundations of socialism. The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We saw through the tricks of these bad guys. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "We cannot make a fortune during the disaster. We are a socialist collective economy and cannot do capitalist things." Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly resisted this evil wind, and struck down the sabotage activities of the class enemies. During the difficult times, we did not sell a single jin of high-priced grain, but instead supported other production teams with a lot of grain and hay. This incident made us poor and lower-middle peasants deeply realize that at any time, the poor and lower-middle peasants and the landlords and rich peasants are sworn enemies, forever unable to sit together, speak together, or sing in harmony. Through this struggle, our confidence in taking the socialist road was further strengthened. We poor and lower-middle peasants united as one, with one heart for the collective, making the collective economy more solid and stronger.

	To strike a snake, you must hit its head; to uproot a tree, you must dig up its roots. China's Khrushchev is the representative of capitalism and revisionism in China, the backer of all ghosts and monsters, and our mortal enemy. We must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating "falling dogs," and fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink, ensuring that he never rises again, and guaranteeing that the iron mountain of the proletariat remains unshakable for eternity.

　　中国的赫鲁晓夫是我们的死对头
　　贾承让
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在我国经济暂时遭到困难的时候，同国际上的帝、修、反，和国内的地、富、反、坏、右，一个鼻孔出气，大刮资本主义、修正主义的黑风。“三自一包”就是他亲自炮制出来的一个大黑货，是他阴谋复辟资本主义的铁证。
    对待“三自一包”，谁最喜欢、最拥护？谁最愤恨、最反对？我们贫下中农最清楚，最有发言权。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”一九四五年大寨解放后，广大贫下中农就遵照毛主席的英明指示，组织起来，走集体化的道路。二十二年来，我们一直沿着这条道路，越走越宽，越走越有奔头，越走越繁荣兴旺。
    大寨贫下中农从自己的亲身经历中深深体会到：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如社会主义好。旧社会，大寨村穷、地穷、人穷。那时，全村百分之六十的土地是地主、富农的，仅有的几条牛也大多数圈在他们圈里。穷哥儿们一年到头，累死累活，吃不饱，穿不暖。解放后，我们走上了社会主义集体化的道路，生产发展一年比一年快，变化一年比一年大，生活一年比一年好。从一九五三年初级农业社到现在，粮食亩产和总产年年上升。办初级社的第一年，平均亩产二百四十斤，比单干时期提高了一倍。到人民公社化的一九五八年，平均亩产上升到五百四十二斤，比初级社提高了一倍还多。人民公社化以后，生产发展更快。到一九六二年亩产就达到七百七十四斤。一九六三年虽然遭到了百年不遇的洪水灾害，但经过一年的恢复，一九六四年的亩产又增长到八百零九斤。一九六六年大寨虽然水、旱、风、雹、虫五灾俱全，仍然获得了大丰收，按有收获的面积计算，亩产达到了八百二十多斤。今年大寨的夏粮作物又获得了历史上从没有过的大丰收，亩产量比去年增加二倍。这一切都充分说明，只有走集体化的道路，才是唯一正确的光明大道。随着集体经济的发展，不仅大寨发生了翻天覆地的变化，全国广大农村也正在迅速改变着“一穷二白”的落后面貌。
    “敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们的胜利，引起了阶级敌人的憎恨。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对我国农村发生的巨大变化恨之入骨。他顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，和地主、富农、资本家穿一条裤子，唱一个调子，极力推销“三自一包”大黑货，胡说什么只有“包产到户”才能促进生产发展，叫嚷“自由市场还是要搞下去的”，“即使产生新的资产阶级分子也不可怕”，“不要怕资本主义泛滥”等等。呸！中国的赫鲁晓夫，你真是胆大包天，反动到了极点。你公开号召复辟资本主义，妄图把我们拉到旧社会，重新给地主当牛作马，吃二遍苦，这完全是白日作梦，痴心妄想！
    哪里发臭，哪里的苍蝇就活动得厉害。当党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派刮起这股“三自一包”妖风的时候，我们大寨的地主、富农也蠢蠢欲动，大搞自由贸易，进行投机倒把，企图拆集体经济的台，挖社会主义的墙脚。用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，心最红，眼最亮。我们识破了这些坏家伙的阴谋。贫下中农说：“我们不能趁灾荒发财。我们是社会主义的集体经济，不能办资本主义的事情。”大伙儿按照毛主席的教导，坚决顶住了这股妖风，打击了阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动。困难时期，我们不仅没有卖一斤高价粮，还支援了别的生产队不少粮食和谷草。这件事，使我们贫下中农深深地认识到，什么时候，贫下中农和地主、富农都是冤家对头，永远坐不在一块，说不到一起，弹不在一根弦上。通过这场斗争，更加坚定了我们走社会主义道路的信心。我们贫下中农齐心合力，一个心眼为集体，把集体经济办得更加巩固，更加壮大了。
    打蛇要打头，刨树要刨根。中国的赫鲁晓夫是资本主义、修正主义在中国的总代表，是一切牛鬼蛇神的总后台，是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打“落水狗”的精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，使他永世不得翻身，保证无产阶级铁打的江山千秋万代永不变色。
