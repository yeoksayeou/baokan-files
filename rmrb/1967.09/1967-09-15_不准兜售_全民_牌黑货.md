	No Selling of "All-People's" Black Goods		Congzhong Xiao
	When the rabbit dies, the fox mourns; when the lips are gone, the teeth feel the cold. Khrushchev's downfall made the Chinese Khrushchev deeply saddened. He desperately tried to rehabilitate his fallen comrade and summon his spirit. In 1965, he openly stated: "It is very difficult to conclude what kind of country the Soviet Union is. It is also very difficult to conclude what kind of party the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is."

	This black talk is full of hidden meanings and has a lot to say.

	"What kind of country is the Soviet Union?" Khrushchev answered bluntly: "A state of the whole people." Our party, in the 1964 publication "On Khrushchev's Phony Communism and Its Historical Lessons to the World" (Nine Criticisms), clearly concluded: "His so-called 'state of the whole people' is indeed not a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but a state where the Khrushchev revisionist clique of a few people exercises dictatorship over the vast majority of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in the Soviet Union."

	"What kind of party is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union?" Khrushchev also answered clearly: "A party of the whole people." The "Nine Criticisms" also made a concrete conclusion: The so-called "party of the whole people" is to fundamentally change the proletarian nature of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, transforming a Marxist-Leninist party into a revisionist party.

	After Khrushchev usurped the party and government power in the Soviet Union, he internally carried out a large-scale capitalist restoration and implemented bourgeois dictatorship. From then on, the Soviet Union became a state of bourgeois dictatorship; the CPSU became a party that betrayed Marxism-Leninism. Although the conclusion has been made, the Chinese Khrushchev, in 1965, still feigned: "It is very difficult to conclude." In fact, it is not that it is "very difficult to conclude," but he had already concluded that Khrushchev's "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people" were correct. It is just that he is cunning and did not blatantly say it, so there is the phrase "very difficult."

	After Khrushchev's downfall, before the opening of the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, the Chinese Khrushchev eagerly jumped out to rehabilitate Khrushchev and summon his spirit, which had internal and external political purposes.

	Externally, he saw that Khrushchev had become stinkingly infamous, so he placed his hopes on Khrushchev's successors, hoping they would implement a Khrushchev revisionism without Khrushchev. To rehabilitate the fallen, is to encourage the successors. He shouted and cheered for the "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people," wanting the successors to continue sliding down the road of the "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people."

	Internally, he wanted to restore capitalism in China. The black goods he peddled were Khrushchev's revisionist goods, only with a different label. Therefore, to rehabilitate Khrushchev is to give himself courage, dreaming of peddling the black goods of the "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people" in China, attempting to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism.

	"Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot." Those who rehabilitate revisionism will never have a good ending. Trotsky, who rehabilitated Kautsky, was like this; Khrushchev, who rehabilitated Trotsky, was also like this; the Chinese Khrushchev, who rehabilitated Khrushchev, is even more like this!

    不准兜售“全民”牌黑货		丛中笑
    兔死狐悲，唇亡齿寒。赫鲁晓夫的垮台，使中国赫鲁晓夫无比伤怀。他竭力要为其难兄翻案、招魂。在一九六五年，他公然说：“苏联究竟是个什么样的国家，你就很难下结论。苏联共产党到底是什么性质的党，现在很难下结论。”
    这段黑话，话中有话，大有文章。
    “苏联究竟是个什么样的国家”？赫鲁晓夫回答得很干脆：“全民国家”。我们党早在一九六四年发表的《关于赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义及其在世界历史上的教训》（九评）中，就对此作了明确的结论：“他的所谓‘全民国家’，的的确确不是无产阶级专政的国家，而是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团一小撮人对苏联广大的工人、农民和革命知识分子实行专政的国家。”
    “苏联共产党到底是什么性质的党”？赫鲁晓夫回答得也很清楚：“全民党”。《九评》对此也作了切实的结论：所谓“全民党”，“就是要根本改变苏联共产党的无产阶级性质，把马克思列宁主义的党改造成为修正主义的党”。
    赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党政大权之后，在国内大搞资本主义复辟，实行了资产阶级专政，从此苏联就变成了资产阶级专政的国家；苏共就变成了背叛马列主义的修正主义党。明明结论已定，可是，中国赫鲁晓夫到了一九六五年，对此还佯称：“很难下结论”。其实，不是什么“很难下结论”，而是他早已下了肯定赫鲁晓夫的“全民国家”、“全民党”的结论，只不过因为他老奸巨猾，没有赤裸裸讲出来，因此，才有“很难”之云罢了。
    赫鲁晓夫垮台之后，苏共二十三大开场之前，中国赫鲁晓夫迫不及待地跳出来为赫鲁晓夫翻案、招魂，是有其内外政治目的的。
    对外，他看到赫鲁晓夫已臭不可闻了，于是将希望寄托于赫鲁晓夫的继承者们，希望他们实行一个没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。为垮台者翻案，就是为继承者打气。他为“全民国家”、“全民党”呐喊助威，就是要继承者们沿着“全民国家”、“全民党”的道路继续滑下去。
    对内，他一心想在中国复辟资本主义，他所贩卖的就是赫鲁晓夫那套修正主义黑货，只不过是换了个商标罢了。因此，为赫鲁晓夫翻案，就是为他自己壮胆，梦想在中国兜售“全民国家”、“全民党”的黑货，妄图取消无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    “搬起石头打自己的脚”。为修正主义翻案的人绝没有好下场。为考茨基翻案的托洛茨基如此，为托洛茨基翻案的赫鲁晓夫也如此，为赫鲁晓夫翻案的中国赫鲁晓夫更是如此！
