The Japanese Socialist Party held its 29th Extraordinary Congress in Tokyo on August 19th and 20th. This congress was convened amidst a fierce assault by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique led by Kyuichi Tokuda, and the right-wing faction of the Socialist Party against the Socialist Party's Sasaki faction.

During the two-day congress, representatives of the Socialist Party's Sasaki faction engaged in heated debates with right-wing representatives over the policy of strengthening and expanding the Japan-China friendship movement.

The congress decided that Seiichi Seikanda (former Wada faction) of the right-wing would replace Moritaro Sasaki as chairman, while the right-wing leaders Sadakichi Eda and Mitsu Harano (former Kawakami faction) would serve as vice-chairmen. Kazuo Yamamoto of the Sasaki faction would replace Tomonari Narita as secretary-general. Juman Kuroda was removed from his position as chairman of the inspection committee.

The struggle between the Socialist Party's Sasaki faction and the right-wing has a long history. In particular, in May of this year, after the Socialist Party's central committee decided to condemn the anti-China activities of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique and expressed support for the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, the right-wing led by Sadakichi Eda, in coordination with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique, intensified their attacks on the Socialist Party's central committee's Sasaki faction. They openly demanded the withdrawal of the Socialist Party's central committee's correct policy of supporting the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters. They also attacked the Socialist Party's inspection committee chairman Juman Kuroda for making a speech praising China's successful hydrogen bomb test, claiming it violated the Socialist Party's policy. On the eve of this congress, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique published a series of articles in the Akahata newspaper, encouraging the Socialist Party's right-wing to push the Socialist Party to the right.

At this congress, when the Socialist Party's central executive committee proposed a policy of strengthening and expanding the Japan-China friendship movement, condemning the anti-China activities of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique, supporting the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, and expanding and strengthening the Japan-China friendship movement, right-wing representatives demanded the cancellation of the Socialist Party's policy of supporting the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters. At this point, representatives of the Sasaki faction, especially local representatives, took the stage one after another to engage in a point-by-point struggle with the right-wing.

The congress passed, by a majority vote, the policy of strengthening and expanding the Japan-China friendship movement proposed by the Socialist Party's central executive committee.

　　日本社会党召开临时党代表大会
    大会围绕加强和扩大日中友好运动方针展开激烈斗争
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党八月十九日和二十日在东京召开了第二十九次临时党代表大会。这次大会是在美日反动派、日共宫本修正主义集团和社会党右派联合向社会党佐佐木派进行猖狂进攻的情况下召开的。
    在两天的大会上，社会党佐佐木派的代表同右派代表围绕着加强和扩大日中友好运动的方针展开了激烈的斗争。
    大会确定社会党右派的胜间田清一（旧和田派）代替佐佐木更三担任委员长，右派总头目江田三郎和河野密（旧河上派）担任副委员长，佐佐木派的山本幸一代替成田知已担任书记长。黑田寿男被解除了监察委员长的职务。
    社会党佐佐木派同右派之间的斗争由来已久。特别是今年五月，社会党中央决定谴责日共宫本修正主义集团的反华活动并表示支持日中友好协会（正统）总部的方针后，以江田为首的右派配合美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团的反华活动，加强了对社会党中央佐佐木派的攻击，公然要求撤销社会党中央支持日中友好协会（正统）总部的正确方针。他们还攻击社会党监察委员长黑田寿男发表赞扬中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的谈话是违反社会党的方针。在这次大会前夕，日共宫本修正主义集团在《赤旗报》上连续发表文章，鼓励社会党右派把社会党拉向右转。
    在这次大会上，当社会党中央执行委员会提出加强和扩大日中友好运动的方针，主张谴责日共宫本修正主义集团的反华活动、支持日中友好协会（正统）总部、扩大和加强日中友好运动时，右派代表要求取消社会党支持日中友好协会（正统）总部的方针。这时，佐佐木派的代表特别是地方代表纷纷上台发言，同右派进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    大会以多数通过了社会党中央执行委员会提出的加强和扩大日中友好运动的方针。
