Australian revolutionary people are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview and guide their revolutionary struggles.

The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), *Vanguard*, recently published several letters from readers, reflecting the situation of Australian revolutionary people actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. These letters indicate that an increasing number of Australian revolutionary people are using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews and engage in practical struggles.

An old warrior who has participated in the Australian revolutionary struggle for thirty years wrote in a letter about how he used Chairman Mao's works to transform his own thoughts. He said that he had once been influenced by reformism and lost his way. He wrote: "I neglected the actual conditions of life in Australia and neglected my own personal experiences in some fierce class struggles."

He said, "Studying Mao Zedong's works, especially 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction,' and applying them to my past and present life, proved that I had taken the wrong path in the past." He said, "I gradually realized that the only way is to rebel."

He believed that studying Chairman Mao's two brilliant philosophical works and the "Three Constantly Read Articles" helped him understand the Communist Party and love it even more. He pointed out that studying Chairman Mao's works is not just about learning from books, but more importantly, learning from revolutionary struggles.

He said, "Mao Zedong Thought has changed my life, enabling me to contribute my strength to the victory of communism."

A reader who does mass work wrote: "A great achievement I gained from studying Mao Zedong's works is a clearer understanding of the role of an individual in the revolutionary mass movement."

He said that after studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized "how one can transform oneself by serving the people, and that one can only transform oneself by serving the people in the actual struggle of the revolutionary cause."

Another reader who does mass work wrote: "Mao Zedong Thought helped me overcome the difficulties and setbacks I encountered in my mass work."

He said that in Chairman Mao's essay "Oppose Bookism," there is a passage: "Can't you solve that problem? Then go and investigate the current state and history of that problem!" After studying this passage, he began to conduct an investigation and research on his work.

He said, "The investigation and research helped me examine my mass perspective and my own level of understanding, as well as the level of understanding of the masses. It helped me understand why I previously thought that the mass organizations were advanced in some issues but backward in others."

He said, "Previously, I felt helpless and disappointed about the backward aspects of the mass organizations and happy about the progressive aspects. Now I understand their mutual influence. In terms of understanding mass work, I have only touched the surface and need to conduct extensive investigations and deeper applications of Mao Zedong's works."

A housewife wrote in a letter that she used to think only workers could participate in class struggles. However, after studying Chairman Mao's work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and some of Chairman Mao's quotations, she had a completely different view and realized that she could also participate in the struggle.

She said, "I can rearrange my household chores. I try to ensure that I read some of Mao Zedong's works every day... I am establishing completely different relationships with my neighbors... I think they and I are all victims of the capitalist system, and in the struggle against the capitalist system, I can help them. I think I am beginning to 'serve the people.'"

### 澳大利亚革命人民在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作　用毛泽东思想改造世界观指导革命斗争

　　澳大利亚革命人民在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作
　　用毛泽东思想改造世界观指导革命斗争
    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》最近刊登一些读者来信，反映了澳大利亚革命人民活学活用毛主席著作的情况。这些读者来信表明，越来越多的澳大利亚革命人民正在运用毛泽东思想进行思想改造和从事实际斗争。
    一位参加澳大利亚革命斗争已经有三十年历史的老战士，在来信中谈到他运用毛主席著作改造自己思想的情况。他说，他曾经受改良主义的影响，迷失了方向。他写道：“我忽视了澳大利亚生活的实际，忽视了我自己在一些激烈的阶级斗争中的亲身经验。”
    他说，“学习毛泽东的著作，特别是学习《实践论》和《矛盾论》，并且运用到我过去和现在的生活中，就证明了我过去走上了错误的道路。”他说：“我逐渐觉悟到，唯一的办法是起来造反。”
    他认为，学习毛主席这两篇光辉的哲学著作和“老三篇”，使他了解了共产党，更加热爱共产党。他指出，学习毛主席著作不仅要在书本中学，而更重要的是在革命斗争中学。
    他说，“毛泽东思想已经改变了我的生活，使我能够以我的力量为共产主义胜利作出贡献”。
    一位做群众工作的读者在信中说：“我从学习毛泽东著作中所获得的一个巨大的成绩是，更加清楚地懂得了个人在革命的群众运动中的作用。”
    他说，在学习毛主席著作以后，使他认识到“一个人怎样才能在为人民服务中改造自己，而且只有在革命事业的实际斗争过程中为人民服务才能改造自己”。
    另一位做群众工作的读者写道：“毛泽东思想帮助我克服了我在群众工作中遇到的困难和挫折。”
    他说，毛主席在《反对本本主义》一文中有这样一段话：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！”他学习了这段话以后，就开始对他的工作做了一次调查研究。
    他说，调查研究“帮助我检查了我的群众观点和我自己的认识水平以及群众的认识水平，帮助我懂得了为什么我过去会认为群众组织在一些问题上是先进的，而在另一些问题上是落后的。”
    他说：“以前，我对群众组织的落后方面只感到毫无办法和失望，对进步就感到高兴。现在我懂得了它们之间的相互影响，在了解群众工作方面，我仅仅触及了表面，还需要进行广泛的调查研究和更深入地应用毛泽东著作。”
    一位家庭妇女的信中说，她以前认为只有工人才能参加阶级斗争，但是在学习了毛主席著作《为人民服务》和一些毛主席语录以后，就有了完全不同的看法，认识到自己也可以参加斗争。
    她说：“我可以重新安排家务。我试图保证每天读一些毛泽东的著作……我正在和我的邻居建立完全不同的关系。……我认为他们和我自己一样，都是资本主义制度的受害者，在反对资本主义制度的斗争中，我可以帮助他们。我认为，我正在开始‘为人民服务’。”
