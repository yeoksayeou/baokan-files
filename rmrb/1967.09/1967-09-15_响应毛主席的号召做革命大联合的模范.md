Responding to Chairman Mao's call to be a model of revolutionary unity

Revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres across the country are enthusiastically studying the editorial of the People's Daily, unanimously agreeing that revolutionary unity is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and a crucial condition for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary clique headed by China's Khrushchev, the proletarian revolutionaries must unite and cannot split.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 14th, amidst the nationwide surge of revolutionary criticism, the People's Daily published the important editorial "In the Great Criticism, Promote Revolutionary Unity" and a report on Shanghai's Zhabei District workers overcoming divisions to form a unified organization. This has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses across the country. Filled with revolutionary fervor, they are studying the editorial repeatedly, especially the latest instructions from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They say, this is the great commander Chairman Mao's new call to arms, the greatest concern for us proletarian revolutionaries. We must firmly engrave it in our minds, implement it without deviation, and strive to be models of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity.

Today, after hearing the editorial and the report on the revolutionary unity of Shanghai's Zhabei District workers on the radio, the proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and Qinghai immediately organized study sessions, discussions, and propaganda activities.

Revolutionary workers and cadres from factories and enterprises in the capital held study sessions and symposiums today, expressing that promoting revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and a crucial condition for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries can only unite, not split. Revolutionary comrades from Beijing Steel Wire Factory, who recently achieved revolutionary unity, believe that achieving revolutionary unity can concentrate forces to carry out revolutionary criticism. Factionalism, cliques, and even armed conflicts are all deviations from Mao Zedong Thought. We must put the interests of the revolution and the proletarian party spirit first, and strive to be models of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity. Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, revolutionary cadres from government agencies, and poor and lower-middle peasants from the suburbs also expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's new great call, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and welcome a new high tide of revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary comrades and masses in Shanghai, who are advancing in the revolutionary criticism, expressed their determination to respond to the new call to arms from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism. Workers from Zhabei District, after hearing the editorial and the report on their overcoming divisions to form a unified district-wide organization on the radio, were overjoyed and spread the news. The standing committee members of the newly established district-wide workers' revolutionary organization said excitedly, "This is the greatest concern, encouragement, and exhortation from our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We must study Chairman Mao's works more seriously and unyieldingly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, consolidating the revolutionary unity of workers across the district."

Some leaders from the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters held a discussion after listening to the editorial on the radio. They said, achieving and strengthening revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism is a need of the current revolutionary situation, a need to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a need for "revolution and production." We, the working class of Shandong Province, will definitely respond to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, further expand and consolidate revolutionary unity in the criticism, and strive for victory in both revolution and production. Leaders from the Revolutionary Rebel Command of Jinan Diesel Engine Factory said: Chairman Mao's words have struck the hearts of us proletarian revolutionaries. Within the working class, there are a thousand reasons to unite and no reason to split. We revolutionary workers will definitely follow the words of the great commander Chairman Mao, carry out thorough ideological revolutionization, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, and raise high the banners of revolutionary criticism and unity. We will direct our class hatred towards China's Khrushchev and his agents, fight them down and expose them, and in the struggle, further expand and consolidate revolutionary unity.

The United Revolutionary Command of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps, the Shanxi Provincial Red Headquarters, and the Taiyuan Revolutionary Rebel Command held a study session on the editorial. Everyone agreed that the situation of the Shanxi Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better. In this excellent situation, we must firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out revolutionary criticism, and further promote and develop revolutionary unity. The class enemy fears our unity the most. They sow discord, spread rumors, and try to split us. We must not fall for their tricks and must raise high the banner of revolutionary unity, carry out revolutionary criticism. At the same time, we must criticize and overcome non-proletarian trends and consolidate our unity.

Revolutionary comrades and masses in Harbin expressed after studying the editorial that the primary task facing us proletarian revolutionaries is to concentrate our firepower and targets to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary clique within the Party. We have a thousand reasons and ten thousand reasons to unite and fight the enemy together, and not a single reason to split and fight "internal wars." Red Guards from Harbin Vehicle Factory pointed out that in the old society, we workers were all class brothers oppressed and exploited by imperialism and capitalism; today, in the Cultural Revolution, we have a common revolutionary goal, which is to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. We have no reason not to unite.

Revolutionary comrades from Guiyang expressed that the experience of Shanghai's Zhabei District workers overcoming divisions and achieving revolutionary unity is excellent! We, the proletarian revolutionaries of Guizhou, will definitely learn from them. They said, the proletarian revolutionaries of Guizhou, like those across the country, are currently focusing on the counter-revolutionary clique within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, carrying out extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle. For this common revolutionary goal, we must mobilize millions of people to form a mighty army, isolate the counter-revolutionary clique within the Party to the greatest extent, and criticize and expose them.

The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary comrades from the industrial and transportation system in Qinghai Province said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have been able to move from one victory to another because we follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and under the premise of unity in the great direction of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seek common ground while reserving differences, uniting all forces that can be united, and isolating the enemy to the greatest extent. In the future, we will definitely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, be models of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity.

    把革命的全局利益和无产阶级的党性放在首要地位
    响应毛主席的号召做革命大联合的模范
    全国各地无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众热烈学习《人民日报》社论，一致认为，革命的大联合是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要内容，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的重要条件。在彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，无产阶级革命派只能联合，不能分裂。
    据新华社十四日讯　在全国范围内蓬勃兴起革命大批判的高潮中，《人民日报》发表了《在革命的大批判中大力促进革命的大联合》重要社论和上海闸北区工人克服分裂、成立统一组织的报道，给各地无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众以极大鼓舞。他们满怀革命激情，一遍又一遍地学习社论中传达的我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。他们说，这是伟大统帅毛主席对我们发出的新的战斗号召，是对我们无产阶级革命派最大的关怀，我们一定要牢牢地铭刻在脑中，不折不扣地贯彻到行动上，坚决争取做革命大批判的模范，做革命大联合的模范。
    北京、上海、山东、山西、黑龙江、贵州、青海等地的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众，今天在广播中听到《人民日报》这篇社论和上海闸北区工人实现革命的大联合的报道后，立即认真地组织学习、讨论和开展宣传活动。
    首都厂矿企业的广大革命职工和革命群众组织负责人在今天举行的学习会、座谈会上表示：在革命大批判中大力促进革命的大联合，这是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要内容，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的重要条件。我们无产阶级革命派只能联合，不能分裂。最近实现革命大联合的北京钢丝厂革命派战士认为，搞好革命大联合，就能集中力量搞好革命的大批判。搞派性，搞山头，甚至搞武斗，都是背离毛泽东思想的。我们一定要把革命的利益，把无产阶级的党性，放在第一位，做革命大批判的模范，做革命大联合的模范。首都大中学校的红卫兵小将、革命教师和机关革命干部、郊区的广大贫下中农也纷纷表示，一定要响应毛主席的新的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命大批判中迎接革命大联合的新高潮。
    在革命大批判中阔步前进的上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众表示：坚决响应最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的新的战斗号召，在革命的大批判中进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合。闸北区革命派工人，从广播里听到《人民日报》社论和介绍他们克服分裂成立全区统一组织的报道后，欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。新成立的全区性工人革命派组织的常委们万分激动地说，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓励和最大的鞭策。我们一定要更加认真地读毛主席的书，更加坚定不移地照毛主席的指示办事，巩固全区革命派工人的革命大联合。
    山东革命工人造反总指挥部的一些负责人从广播中收听到《人民日报》社论后，马上进行了座谈。他们说，在革命的大批判中，实现和加强革命的大联合，是当前革命形势的需要，是巩固和加强无产阶级专政的需要，是“抓革命，促生产”的需要。我们山东省的工人阶级一定坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，努力活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字，大立公字，在大批判中进一步扩大和巩固革命大联合，争取革命、生产双胜利。济南柴油机厂革命造反指挥部的负责人说：毛主席的话说到我们无产阶级革命派心坎上了。我们工人阶级内部，有一千条理由联合，没有一条理由分裂。我们革命工人一定听伟大统帅毛主席的话，大搞思想革命化，破私立公，更高地举起革命大批判、大联合的旗帜，把阶级仇恨集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人身上，把他们斗倒斗臭，并在斗争中进一步扩大和巩固革命的大联合。
    山西革命造反兵团、山西省红总站、太原革命造反司令部联合组成的无产阶级革命派联合指挥部，组织革命战士学习了这篇社论，大家认为：当前山西文化大革命形势大好，而且愈来愈好。在大好形势下，我们必须坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，进一步促进和发展革命的大联合。阶级敌人最害怕我们联合，他们挑拨离间，造谣惑众，企图分裂我们。我们绝不能上他们的当，一定要更高地举起革命大联合的旗帜，搞好革命的大批判。同时，批判和克服非无产阶级思潮，巩固我们的大联合。
    哈尔滨市无产阶级革命派和革命群众学习了社论后纷纷表示：当前，摆在我们无产阶级革命派面前的首要任务，就是集中火力，集中目标，彻底批倒批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。我们有一千个理由、一万个理由联合起来，共同对敌，没有半点理由闹分裂、打“内战”。哈尔滨车辆厂的红色造反者指出，在旧社会我们工人都是受帝国主义、资本主义的压迫、剥削的阶级兄弟；今天，在文化大革命中，我们又有一个共同的革命目标，就是彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。我们没有理由不联合起来。
    贵阳市无产阶级革命派广大战士，今天也以极大的注意力学习了《人民日报》的社论。他们纷纷指出，上海闸北区工人克服分裂，实现革命大联合的经验，好得很！我们贵州无产阶级革命派坚决向他们学习。他们说，贵州省无产阶级革命派同全国一样，目前正对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争。为了这个共同的革命目标，我们必须调动千千万万的群众，组成浩浩荡荡的大军，最大限度地把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派孤立起来，把他们批倒批臭。
    在革命的大批判中不断巩固和发展革命大联合的青海省工交系统“八·一八”无产阶级革命派说，我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，之所以能从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，就是因为听毛主席的话，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，在执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线这个大方向一致的前提下，求大同，存小异，把一切能够联合的力量都联合了起来，把敌人最大限度地孤立了起来。今后，我们更要响应毛主席、党中央的号召，当革命大批判的模范，作革命大联合的模范。
