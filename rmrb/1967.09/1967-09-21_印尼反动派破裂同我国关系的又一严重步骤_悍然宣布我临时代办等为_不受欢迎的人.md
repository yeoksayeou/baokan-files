The Indonesian reactionary forces, led by Suharto and Nasution, on the orders of their American masters, brazenly declared China's chargé d'affaires, Lü Zibo, and Second Secretary and Consul Su Sheng as "unwelcome persons," demanding that they leave the country by the 18th. This is another serious step by the Indonesian fascist military regime to completely sever relations with China, and a grave provocation against the 700 million Chinese people.

On the 14th, Su Sheng, Second Secretary and Consul at the Chinese Embassy, was summoned by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry. He refused to accept the unreasonable expulsion of Chinese diplomatic personnel by the Indonesian fascist military regime, immediately listing the facts, strongly refuting the accusations, and lodging the strongest protest.

To create a pretext for this anti-China crime, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime resorted to the already discredited lie that the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia opened fire on August 5, injuring three Indonesian thugs and one reactionary soldier.

It is well known that on August 5, when the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime mobilized armed police and thugs to launch a frenzied attack on the Chinese Embassy, it was the Indonesian thugs who set fire to the embassy building and injured four Chinese diplomatic personnel. It was the Indonesian reactionary police who stormed the Chinese Embassy, firing hundreds of shots, deliberately causing chaos to injure Indonesian thugs and reactionary soldiers, attempting to frame the Chinese Embassy with this vicious scheme to create further anti-China pretexts. To achieve this conspiracy, the Indonesian fascist military regime mobilized all its propaganda machines, causing a stir. However, lies cannot cover up the facts. The Chief of Staff of the Jakarta Military Region, Naseri, inadvertently admitted that the thugs were shot by Indonesian armed forces while they were rushing into the Chinese Embassy compound. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials, who were forced to inspect the scene at the Chinese Embassy, also had to admit in the face of facts: "The direction of the bullet shots was from outside to inside."

More than a month later, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime once again picked up this already thoroughly discredited lie as a pretext to expel Chinese diplomatic personnel and further anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, which is indeed despicable and laughable.

　　印尼反动派破裂同我国关系的又一严重步骤
　　悍然宣布我临时代办等为“不受欢迎的人”
    新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权，十四日奉美国主子之命，悍然宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波和二等秘书兼领事苏生为“不受欢迎的人”，限期于十八日前离境。这是印尼法西斯军人政权完全破裂两国关系的又一严重步骤，是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。
    十四日被印尼外交部召见的中国大使馆二等秘书兼领事苏生，拒绝接受印尼法西斯军人政权无理驱赶我国外交人员的照会，当场列举事实，痛加驳斥，并提出最强烈抗议。
    为了给这一反华罪行制造借口，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权竟然捧出早已破产的谎言，胡说中国驻印尼大使馆在八月五日开枪打伤三名印尼暴徒和一名反动军人。
    众所周知，八月五日，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权调动武装军警和暴徒对中国大使馆进行疯狂袭击的时候，正是印尼暴徒纵火焚烧了大使馆房屋，打伤了四名中国外交人员；正是印尼反动军警冲进中国大使馆，开枪数百发，有计划地在混乱中打伤印尼暴徒和反动军人，妄图用这种毒辣手段嫁祸于中国大使馆，为进一步反华制造口实。为了实现这一阴谋，印尼法西斯军人政权开动全部宣传机器，喧嚣一时。但是，谎言总是掩盖不了事实。雅加达军区参谋长纳赛里就不打自招地供认，暴徒是在印尼武装部队对冲进中国大使馆院内的暴徒们进行低射击的时候倒下去的。被迫到中国大使馆院内观看现场的印尼外交部官员在事实面前也不得不承认：“子弹射击的方向是从外向里射击的。”
    事隔一个多月的今天，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权又重新拣起这个早已彻底破产的谎言做为驱赶我国外交人员、进一步反华排华的借口，实在可鄙，可笑。
