A thunderous clap of spring thunder shook the land of China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the August 1st Nanchang Uprising fired the first shot against the reactionary Kuomintang. Our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the great and meaningful Autumn Harvest Uprising and the march to Jinggangshan, opening up the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. After 22 years of bloody struggle, the Chinese people finally achieved victory nationwide in 1949. From then on, our long-suffering motherland stood up like a giant.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power, resolving issues through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally applicable." The victory of the Chinese revolution is a victory of violent revolution, a victory of armed struggle. It once again demonstrates to all oppressed nations and peoples of the world that the armed seizure of power is the central task and highest form of revolution, a universal truth applicable everywhere, and the inevitable path to victory for all oppressed nations and peoples.

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party has, for decades, stood on the reactionary bourgeois position and consistently opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on armed struggle. At every critical moment of the revolution, he would jump out, attempting to dismantle the people's armed forces and betray the Chinese and world revolution. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he openly advocated handing over the people's army to Chiang Kai-shek for "leadership." After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he fervently advocated the "parliamentary road," surrendering to the Kuomintang. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, just as all oppressed nations and peoples around the world were following Chairman Mao's teachings, taking up arms, and walking the path of armed struggle; just as the revolutionary guns were striking fear into the hearts of imperialists and reactionaries worldwide, making them panic and lose their souls, China's Khrushchev eagerly jumped out, using the excuse of "different specific situations in various nations" to claim that "not all countries and places can engage in armed struggle." This is the most vicious attack on the universal law of proletarian violent revolution, a blatant denial of the international significance of China's armed struggle experience, and the greatest betrayal of the world's peoples and world revolution.

China's Khrushchev uses the excuse of "different specific situations in various nations" to cover up the most important and fundamental fact that all reactionary ruling classes in various countries hold state power and wield knives. Thus, he completely and thoroughly betrays Marxist-Leninist state theory. Marxism-Leninism holds that although the specific situations of various countries and nations differ greatly, the reactionary ruling classes of all countries, to maintain their reactionary rule, all have massive military, police, courts, and other violent organs. This is true throughout history, both in China and abroad. Since the Second World War, due to the intensification of class struggle, all capitalist countries have strengthened their state machinery, especially their military. What is a state? Why do the reactionary rulers of various countries strengthen their state machinery? Chairman Mao points out: "The state is a tool of oppression against hostile classes; it is violence, not something 'benevolent.' The reactionary ruling class's state is counter-revolutionary violence. They strengthen the state machinery to more brutally massacre revolutionary people.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. The revolution of all oppressed nations and peoples is to seize power from the reactionary ruling class. However, the reactionary ruling class, which holds powerful violent organs, will not change its nature of devouring people, nor will it lay down its butcher's knife and become a Buddha instantly. They always use violence first, using bayonets to massacre revolutionary people. This is the common nature of all reactionary ruling classes throughout history, an objective law that does not change with people's will. Therefore, oppressed nations and peoples seeking liberation have only one path: armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. Regardless of how "specific the situations in various nations" are, or how many thousands or tens of thousands of reasons there are, on the issue of armed seizure of power, all countries are exceptions.

History is the best witness. The entire history of the proletarian struggle, especially the series of events that have occurred in the international communist movement since the Second World War, completely prove this truth and declare the bankruptcy of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of opposing armed seizure of power.

After the Second World War, the revolutionary victories of countries like China and Vietnam, which were achieved through armed struggle? At the same time that countries like China achieved revolutionary victories through armed struggle, in France and Italy, they slid down another opposite path. During the Second World War, the French Communist Party led tens of thousands of guerrillas, liberating Paris and half of France, with a revolutionary situation looking very promising. But the traitor Thorez is a contemporary "parliamentary fool," insisting on taking the "parliamentary road." He completely met the needs of the big bourgeoisie, handing over all the military and exchanging it for the position of "Vice Premier" and a few "Minister" and "Deputy Minister" positions. According to China's Khrushchev's view, in such a country with a so-called "democratic" tradition, according to this nation's "specific situation," armed struggle should not be necessary to seize power, right? However, soon the French Communist Party was kicked out of the bourgeois government. Twenty years passed, and the French Communist Party not only did not touch a single hair of the French bourgeois political power but also became a insignificant appendage of the bourgeoisie. It is truly shameful and tragic!

In Italy, another great traitor Togliatti also handed over more than twenty thousand troops in exchange for the position of "Vice Premier." To please the bourgeoisie, he shamelessly praised the Italian bourgeois state as the most "democratic." According to China's Khrushchev's view, based on this nation's "specific situation," the Italian bourgeoisie should hand over power to the Communist Party, right? However, the power in Italy is still in the hands of the bourgeoisie, and Togliatti ended up with the same shameful and tragic fate as Thorez.

China's Khrushchev believes that in a country like Burma with such "specific situations," the Communist Party does not need to engage in armed struggle and can lay down their weapons to cooperate with the extremely reactionary Ne Win government to build "socialism" together. However, the Burmese Communist Party saw through China's Khrushchev's treacherous plot to sell them out, did not fall for it, and insisted on armed struggle, thus ensuring the continuous victory of the Burmese people's revolution. As the first vice chairman of the Burmese Communist Party, Comrade Ba Tin said: "We were able to persist in the struggle because we upheld Chairman Mao's thought of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' because we used the gun to oppose China's Khrushchev and the Soviet revisionist leadership's idea and program of cooperating with Ne Win and becoming Ne Win's disciples."

After the Second World War, the Indonesian Communist Party's strength grew significantly, with party members once reaching three million, becoming the largest Communist Party in a capitalist country. According to China's Khrushchev's view, based on Indonesia's "specific situation," the Indonesian Communist Party could peacefully seize power, right? But what happened? As the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee's Political Bureau document said, due to the party leadership's deviation from Marxist-Leninist state theory in the past, emphasizing the so-called peaceful path and parliamentary path, actually abandoning armed struggle, and harboring illusions about "peaceful transition," when the right-wing military clique launched a counter-revolutionary coup, the entire party's work was in a completely passive position. A large number of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses were massacred, causing the Indonesian people to pay a very heavy price. Now, the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee's Political Bureau has summarized the experience and lessons, criticized the right-opportunist errors made by the party leadership in the past, and correctly pointed out: Only by following the path of armed struggle indicated by Chairman Mao can the Indonesian people find their only way out.

The above facts eloquently show that regardless of how different the specific situations in various countries are, proletarian revolution can only achieve victory by taking the path of armed struggle.

Whether or not to acknowledge that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution has always been the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. All Marxist-Leninists have always insisted on armed seizure of power, while the counter-revolutionary revisionists in various countries have always tried every means to abolish the people's revolutionary armed struggle. What "new situation," what "different specific situations in various nations," all these are just excuses made by revisionists. They only use these to attack and oppose proletarian violent revolution, aiming to extinguish the flames of armed struggle of oppressed nations and peoples. The old revisionists did this, Tito and Khrushchev did this, and China's Khrushchev is doing this.

"The four seas are in turmoil, clouds and waters are angry, and the five continents are shaken by thunder and lightning." The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of proletarian armed seizure of power. China's Khrushchev's evil plot to sabotage the world people's armed revolution has completely failed. The oppressed nations and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, under the leadership of the proletarian vanguard, have broken the shackles of modern revisionism, shattered all the nets that bind them, and taken the path of armed struggle. We can confidently say: The flames of armed struggle will surely spread to every corner of the world. The revolutionary gun will definitely create a bright red new world!

    武装夺取政权是革命的普遍规律
    ——驳中国赫鲁晓夫的“各民族中的具体情况”不同的谬论	山东师范学院文革串连红卫兵指挥部
    霹雳一声春雷，震撼着中国的大地。在毛泽东思想的指引下，八一南昌武装起义，打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义和向井冈山进军，开辟了以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路。中国人民经过二十二年的浴血奋战，终于在一九四九年取得了全国的胜利。从此，灾难深重的祖国象巨人一样地站了起来。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”中国革命的胜利，是暴力革命的胜利，是武装斗争的胜利。它再一次向全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民表明，武装夺取政权是革命的中心任务和最高形式，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命胜利的必由之路。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，几十年来，站在资产阶级反动立场上，一贯反对毛主席关于武装斗争的光辉思想。每到革命的关键时刻，他总要跳出来，妄图取消人民武装，出卖中国革命和世界革命。在抗日战争时期，他公然主张把人民的军队交给蒋介石去“领导”。抗日战争胜利后，他又狂热地鼓吹“议会道路”，向国民党缴枪投降。中国革命胜利以后，正当世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民以中国为榜样，遵照毛主席的教导，拿起枪杆子，走武装斗争道路的时候；正当革命的枪杆子把帝国主义和各国反动派打得惊慌失措，丧魂落魄的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫又迫不及待地跳了出来，借口世界“各民族中的具体情况”不同，胡说什么“不是一切国家一切地方都可以进行武装斗争”。这是对无产阶级暴力革命的普遍规律的最恶毒的攻击，是对中国武装斗争经验的国际意义明目张胆的否定，是对世界人民和世界革命的最大背叛。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫借口世界“各民族中的具体情况”不同，来掩盖各国反动统治阶级都掌握着国家政权、手里都拿着刀这一共同的最重要的基本事实。这样，他就完全彻底地背叛了马克思列宁主义国家学说。马克思列宁主义认为，各个国家，各个民族，尽管“具体情况”千差万别，但是各国的反动统治阶级，为了维护它们的反动统治，都有庞大的军队、警察、法院等暴力机关，这一条，古今中外概莫能外。第二次世界大战以来，由于阶级斗争的激烈发展，一切资本主义国家都毫无例外地在加强它们的国家机器，特别是军队。国家是什么？各国反动派如此强化它们的国家机器又是为了什么？毛主席指出：国家“对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”反动统治阶级的国家就是反革命暴力。他们加强国家机器，目的就是为了更残酷地屠杀革命人民。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命，就是要从反动统治阶级手里夺取政权。但是，掌握着强大的暴力机关的反动统治阶级，不会改变吃人的本性，也不会放下屠刀，立地成佛。他们总是首先使用暴力，用刺刀来屠杀革命人民。这是古今中外一切反动统治阶级的共同本性，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。因此，被压迫民族和被压迫人民要获得解放，唯一的出路就是以武装的革命反对武装的反革命。不管
  “各民族中的具体情况”多么特殊，也不管你有几千条几万条理由，在武装夺取政权这一点上，一切国家都毫不例外。
    历史是最好的见证人。无产阶级斗争的全部历史，特别是第二次世界大战以来国际共产主义运动中所发生的一系列的事件，完全证明了这个真理，宣布了中国的赫鲁晓夫反对武装夺取政权的反革命谬论的破产。
    第二次世界大战以后，中国、越南等国家的革命胜利，有哪一个不是通过武装斗争取得的呢？
    就在中国等国家通过武装斗争取得革命胜利的同时，在法国和意大利，却沿着另一条相反的道路滑下去。法国共产党在第二次世界大战时，领导了几十万游击队，解放了巴黎和大半个法国，革命的形势一片大好。但叛徒多列士是当代的“议会迷”，他非要走“议会道路”不可。他完全投合大资产阶级的需要，把军队全部交了出去，换得了一个“副总理”和几个正副“部长”的职位。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的观点，在这样一个所谓具有“民主”传统的国家，按照这个民族的“具体情况”，该是不要武装斗争就可能取得政权了吧！然而不久，法共全被赶出了资产阶级的政府。二十年过去了，法共不仅没触动法国资产阶级政权的一根毫毛，本身也变成了资产阶级的微不足道的附庸。实在可耻可悲！
    在意大利，另一个大叛徒陶里亚蒂，也交出二十多万军队，换得了一个“副总理”。他为了讨资产阶级的欢心，竟然无耻地把意大利的资产阶级国家吹嘘成最“民主”的国家。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，根据这个民族的“具体情况”，意大利的资产阶级就可以把政权拱手让给共产党了吧！然而意大利的政权依然掌握在资产阶级手里，陶里亚蒂只落得同多列士一样可耻可悲的下场。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫认为，在象缅甸这样“具体情况”的国家，共产党不用搞武装斗争，可以放下武器，同反动透顶的奈温政府合作，一同建设“社会主义”。然而缅甸共产党识破了中国赫鲁晓夫出卖他们的罪恶阴谋，不上他的当，坚持了武装斗争，从而保证了缅甸人民革命不断胜利前进。正如缅甸共产党中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶同志所指出的：“我们所以能够坚持斗争，是由于我们树立了毛主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的思想，是由于我们使用了枪杆子、反对了中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏修领导集团要我们同奈温合作、并做奈温门徒的思想和纲领的结果。”
    第二次世界大战以后，印度尼西亚共产党的力量有了很大的发展，共产党员一度达到三百万，成为资本主义国家中最大的共产党。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，根据印尼的“具体情况”，印尼共产党满可以和平取得政权了吧！可是事情又是怎样的呢？正如印尼共产党中央政治局的文件所说的那样，由于过去党的领导背离了马克思列宁主义的国家学说，片面地强调所谓和平道路、议会道路的可能性，实际上放弃了武装斗争，对“和平过渡”存有幻想，因此，当右派军人集团发动反革命政变时，整个党的工作便处于完全被动的地位，大批的共产党员和革命群众惨遭杀害，使印尼人民付出了极为惨痛的代价。现在印尼共产党中央政治局总结了经验教训，批判了过去党的领导所犯的右倾机会主义错误，正确地指出：必须走毛主席指出的武装斗争的道路，才是印尼人民唯一的出路。
    上述事实雄辩地说明，不管各国家中的具体情况多么不同，无产阶级革命要取得胜利，都只有走武装斗争的道路。
    承认不承认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，历来是革命和反革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭。一切马克思列宁主义者，从来都坚持武装夺取政权，各国的反革命修正主义者总是千方百计地要取消人民的革命武装斗争。什么“新形势”啊，什么“各民族中的具体情况”不同啊，统统是修正主义者的借口。他们只不过是以此来攻击和反对无产阶级暴力革命，达到他们扑灭被压迫民族和被压迫人民武装斗争烈火的罪恶目的。老修正主义者是这样干的，铁托、赫鲁晓夫是这样干的，中国的赫鲁晓夫也是这样干的。
      “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”。光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮了无产阶级武装夺取政权的道路。中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图破坏世界人民武装革命的罪恶阴谋彻底破产了。亚非拉被压迫民族和被压迫人民，在无产阶级先锋队的领导下，打碎了现代修正主义的枷锁，冲破了一切束缚他们的罗网，走上了武装斗争的道路。我们完全可以满怀信心地说：武装斗争的烈火必将燃遍全世界的每一个角落。革命的枪杆子一定能打出一个红彤彤的新世界！
