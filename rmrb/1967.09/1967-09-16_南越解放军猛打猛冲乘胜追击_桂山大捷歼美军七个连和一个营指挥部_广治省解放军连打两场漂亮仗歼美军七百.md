The South Vietnamese Liberation Army, undaunted by fatigue, has been fighting continuously and has achieved a significant victory in the Khe Sanh area from September 4th to 6th, annihilating and severely damaging seven companies and a battalion command of the U.S. forces.

The Vietnamese "People's Army" newspaper reported on September 15th the details of the Khe Sanh victory. On the morning of September 4th, a company of U.S. Marines advanced from the Khe Sanh town towards the Chau Ru area. The leading platoon, having just crossed the river, fell into an ambush set by the Liberation Army. Within a few minutes, the entire platoon was annihilated, and the remaining enemy forces were scattered, suffering heavy casualties.

In the afternoon of September 4th, the American aggressors used helicopters to airlift a large number of Marines to the Thuan Yen area, five kilometers southwest of the Thuong Dien town, and then advanced in two columns along Highway 46 towards the Chau Ru area, attempting to surround the Liberation Army there. The Liberation Army, anticipating the enemy's plot, had already prepared for battle. As soon as the enemy entered the ambush, the Liberation Army launched a fierce attack, immediately disrupting the enemy's formation. After just fifteen minutes of fighting, the Liberation Army annihilated two companies of Marines and a battalion command, shot down four enemy planes, and pursued the fleeing enemy, severely damaging another company.

The U.S. aggressors, in their desperate struggle, gathered five companies of Marines from the Le Mountain base southwest of Khe Sanh on the morning of September 6th, attempting to retake the southeastern region of Khe Sanh County. After suffering continuous attacks from the Liberation Army, the U.S. aggressors were timid and moved slowly, constantly harassed by guerrilla forces along the way. With great difficulty, they occupied the 47 Hill and Yong Hoi market, six kilometers southeast of Khe Sanh. That night, the Liberation Army, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of footing, launched a sudden and fierce attack on these two places. The Liberation Army's spearhead units infiltrated the enemy's ranks from multiple directions, splitting and surrounding the enemy in groups. After more than an hour of intense battle, the Liberation Army controlled the entire battlefield, annihilating three companies of Marines and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies. The remaining enemy forces, terrified, fled in all directions. The Liberation Army pursued and annihilated another batch of U.S. forces.

The clever and brave Liberation Army of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam, following a series of brilliant victories south of the demilitarized zone, fought two more decisive battles in An Xa and Huong Xa on September 7th and 10th, annihilating nearly seven hundred U.S. aggressors, destroying more than ten tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down three enemy planes. On September 10th alone, the Liberation Army killed and wounded more than five hundred U.S. aggressors.

In the afternoon of September 7th, a company of U.S. Marines advanced from Trung An towards the east of An Xa and was fiercely intercepted by the Liberation Army, resulting in the annihilation of more than one hundred enemy forces. On the same day, the Liberation Army also intercepted a batch of Marines who had just left New Forest four kilometers away and pursued them to their base, killing fifty U.S. aggressors, wounding many, and destroying one tank and four GMC military vehicles.

In the afternoon of September 10th, the U.S. imperialists dispatched a battalion of Marines from Bai Mountain, dividing into two columns to advance towards the Huong Xa area, attempting to surround the Liberation Army. The enemy, fearing attacks, moved extremely slowly along the way. Once the enemy entered the ambush, the well-prepared Liberation Army launched a barrage of bullets, catching the enemy off guard and initially annihilating hundreds of enemy forces, destroying and burning multiple tanks and armored vehicles. The remaining enemy forces were terrified and huddled together. At this point, the Liberation Army's artillery units, in coordination with the infantry, launched a fierce assault on the remaining enemy forces, killing and wounding many more.

Another column of enemy forces, in an attempt to rescue their comrades, advanced with the cover of six tanks. The Liberation Army's artillery and infantry units closely coordinated and launched a fierce attack on the advancing enemy forces, almost annihilating them. The enemy's battalion command post and communication center were also paralyzed under the artillery fire. After this day's battle, the Liberation Army annihilated more than five hundred U.S. forces, destroyed more than ten tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down three enemy planes.

    南越解放军猛打猛冲乘胜追击
    桂山大捷歼美军七个连和一个营指挥部
    广治省解放军连打两场漂亮仗歼美军七百
    新华社河内十五日电　越南南方广南省解放武装力量不怕疲劳，连续作战，从四日到六日在桂山地区取得了歼灭和重创美军七个连和一个营指挥部的重大胜利。
    越南《人民军队报》十五日报道桂山大捷的经过情形说，四日上午，美国海军陆战队一个连从桂山县城向州儒地区进犯，走在前面的一个排刚刚渡过河，就陷入了解放武装力量的伏击阵地，几分钟内就被解放武装力量全部歼灭，残余敌人也被打得七零八落，伤亡惨重。
    四日下午，美国强盗又使用直升飞机，向升平县城西南五公里的同阳地区空投大批美国海军陆战队，然后分两路沿四十六号公路向州儒地区推进，妄图包围那里的解放武装力量。解放武装力量看穿了敌人的阴谋，早已严阵以待，敌人刚刚进入伏击圈，就一阵猛冲猛打，顿时把敌人打乱。只经过十五分钟的战斗，解放武装力量就全歼美国海军陆战队两个连和一个营指挥部，击落敌机四架，并且乘胜追击残敌，重创另一个连。
    美国侵略军进行垂死挣扎，六日清晨又纠集美国海军陆战队五个连的敌军，从桂山西南的乐山基地出发，妄图重占桂山县东南地区。美国侵略军在连遭解放武装力量的打击之后，胆小如鼠，行动缓慢，一路上又被游击队不断袭扰，好不容易才占领了桂山东南六公里的四七高地和永辉市集。当天晚上，解放武装力量趁敌人还未站稳脚跟，突然向这两个地方发起猛烈攻击。解放武装力量的各个尖刀组从许多方向插入敌阵，一股一股把敌人分割包围，经过一个多小时的激烈战斗，解放武装力量就控制了整个战场，歼灭美国海军陆战队三个连，缴获大批武器和军用物资。残余敌人胆战心惊，四散逃窜，解放武装力量穷追猛打，又消灭美军一批。
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，机智勇敢的越南南方广治省解放武装力量，继最近在非军事区以南取得一系列辉煌战果后，七日和十日在安溪、胡溪等地又打了两场漂亮仗，共歼灭美国侵略军近七百名，击毁坦克和装甲车十多辆，击落敌机三架。仅十日这一天，解放武装力量就打死打伤美国强盗五百多名。
    七日下午，美国海军陆战队一个连从忠安向安溪东面进发，遭到解放武装力量的猛烈截击，被消灭一百多名。同日，解放武装力量还截击刚离开新林四公里的一批美国海军陆战队，一直追击到它们的驻地，打死美国侵略军五十名，打伤多名，击毁坦克一辆和GMC型军车四辆。
    十日下午，美帝国主义又出动一个营的美国海军陆战队从拜山分兵两路，向胡溪地区推进，妄图包围解放武装力量。敌人生怕挨揍，一路上胆战心惊，非常缓慢地摸索前进。到敌人陷入伏击圈后，严阵以待的解放武装力量向敌人发射出雨点般的子弹，打得敌人措手不及，一开始就消灭了成百名敌人，击毁和烧毁坦克和装甲车多辆。残存敌人惊恐万状，缩作一团。这时，解放军炮兵部队配合步兵向这股残敌发起猛烈轰击，又打死打伤许多敌人。
    另一路敌人为了给同伙解危，在六辆坦克的掩护下，慌忙地前往救援。解放军炮兵和步兵部队又密切配合，协同作战，向前来增援的敌人猛烈袭击，这股敌人几乎全部被消灭。敌人的营部指挥所和通讯联络站在炮火的轰击下，也陷于瘫痪。经过这天战斗，解放武装力量共歼灭美军五百多名，击毁坦克和装甲车十多辆，击落敌机三架。
