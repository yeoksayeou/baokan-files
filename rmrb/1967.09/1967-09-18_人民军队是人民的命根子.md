The people's army is the people's lifeline. In the old society, the people of Baiyangdian, like the poor people across the country, had their heads on their necks, right under the enemy's blade. Even the landlords in our village could arrest and kill people at will. Why was this? It was because we had no guns.

In 1939, Chairman Mao sent underground party organizations to us, showing us a bright path forward and helping us organize guerrilla forces. From then on, we poor people took up big knives and bird guns, cooperating with the Eighth Route Army, fighting stronger and stronger, and finally drove the Japanese devils out of Baiyangdian. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we, along with the people of the whole country, followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "keep every gun and every bullet, and not hand them over." We used our guns to liberate Baiyangdian. But at that time, the Chinese Khrushchev wanted us to put down our guns and join the "national army" and "security forces." Pah! What "national army" and "security forces," they were just tools for the Kuomintang to slaughter the people! The more I think about it, the angrier I get, it makes my lungs want to burst! The gun is the lifeline of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is the lifeline of us poor people. If we follow his trickery, there would be no dictatorship of the proletariat today. After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev's wolfish ambitions flared up again. Through his black henchmen Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, he attempted to turn our army into a tool for his capitalist restoration. We will not allow it. We must thoroughly criticize and expose his counter-revolutionary fallacies, and defeat him completely!

    人民军队是人民的命根子
    旧社会我们白洋淀人民和全国广大穷人一样，是脑袋长在脖子上，贴在敌人的刀刃上，就连我们村的地主也可以随便抓人，随便杀人。这是为什么？就是因为我们没有枪杆子。
    一九三九年，毛主席派来了地下党组织，给我们指出一条光明大道，帮助我们组织起了游击队。从此我们穷人举起大刀、拿起鸟枪，配合八路军，越打越强，终于把日本鬼子赶出了白洋淀。抗战胜利后，我们和全国人民一道根据毛主席“一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去”的教导，用枪杆子解放了白洋淀。可是中国赫鲁晓夫，在那时却要我们放下枪杆子，叫我们去当
  “国军”、“保安队”。呸！什么“国军”、“保安队”，还不是去当国民党屠杀人民的工具！我越想越气，肺都要气炸了！枪杆子是无产阶级专政的命根子，是我们穷人的命根子，要按他的诡计去做，那还有什么今天的无产阶级专政。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心又恶性大发作了，通过他的黑干将彭德怀、罗瑞卿，妄图使我们军队变成他复辟资本主义的工具，我们决不答应。我们一定要把他的反革命谬论批倒批臭，杀他个人仰马翻！
