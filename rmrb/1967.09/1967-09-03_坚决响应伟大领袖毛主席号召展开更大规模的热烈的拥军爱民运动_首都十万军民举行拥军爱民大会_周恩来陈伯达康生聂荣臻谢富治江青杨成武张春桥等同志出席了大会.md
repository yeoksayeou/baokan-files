Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: Ten thousand revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, revolutionary youngsters, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing held a grand meeting to support the army and love the people at the Beijing Workers' Stadium today. They responded most firmly and enthusiastically to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, raised the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and launched a larger-scale and more enthusiastic movement of supporting the army and loving the people.

The meeting emphasized that "supporting the army and loving the people" is a consistent and brilliant idea of Chairman Mao, a glorious tradition of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, and a priceless treasure for victory. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao once again issued the call to "support the army and love the people," which has new content and even greater and more profound significance. It is a strategic slogan and powerful driving force for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Central leaders, members of the Central Military Commission, and responsible comrades from various aspects of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, such as Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Jiang Qing, Yang Chengwu, and Zhang Chunqiao, attended today's meeting.

When the central leaders arrived at the venue, ten thousand military and civilian personnel held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and cheered enthusiastically for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Today, the Workers' Stadium was filled with a fighting spirit of mutual support between the army and the people. The entire venue was adorned with red flags and echoed with songs. A giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed on the stage, and a large banner in the center of the green lawn read: "Launch a larger-scale and more enthusiastic movement of supporting the army and loving the people! Hold high the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" During the meeting, revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the capital continuously shouted: "Firmly respond to the great call of supporting the army and loving the people! Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army! Firmly support the local proletarian revolutionary factions! Firmly support the revolutionary youngsters of the Red Guards! Long live the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!"

At 4:30 PM, the meeting began. Ten thousand people in the venue stood up to pay tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao, and the orchestra played the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." Following this, the military and civilian personnel read aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao: "The army must blend with the people, so that the army appears to the people as their own army. Such an army is invincible in the world." "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people."

Representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards of Higher Education Institutions, and Red Guards of Middle Schools all spoke at the meeting. They expressed their most enthusiastic response to the great call of Great Leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people," raised the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and vowed to always believe in, support, rely on, and learn from the People's Liberation Army, striving to be models of supporting the army. They said, the People's Liberation Army is the army personally created and led by Chairman Mao, personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and is an unparalleled people's army. It is an army of heroes armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great pillar for defending our socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Without the great People's Liberation Army, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would not have achieved such great victories. They said, learning from the People's Liberation Army, we must first be as loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao as the People's Liberation Army is. They pointed out: The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are most afraid of the People's Liberation Army supporting the revolutionary leftists and most afraid of the unity between the army and the people. They use every means to sow discord between the army and the people, directly pointing their arrows at the great People's Liberation Army. We must be highly vigilant and never fall for the tricks of the class enemy. We must cherish the unity between the army and the people as we cherish our eyes, not saying anything that is detrimental to the unity between the army and the people, and not doing anything that is detrimental to the unity between the army and the people. Whoever dares to sow discord between the army and the people and point their arrows at the great People's Liberation Army, we will fight to the end with them. We will hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought, unite closely with the People's Liberation Army, fight shoulder to shoulder, follow the strategic deployment of Great Leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, push the revolutionary criticism to a new high, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev.

Representatives of the revolutionary factions of the People's Liberation Army's various headquarters, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, and the revolutionary factions of the army, navy, air force, and various units stationed in Beijing, such as military academies, research institutes, and cultural and sports organizations, said at the meeting: Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" is the greatest trust, the greatest care, the greatest support, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us, the People's Liberation Army. We fully support it and will definitely carry it out. We must hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," vow to be models of loving the people, and forever be models of loving the people. They said, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," we must be infinitely loyal to Great Leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At present, we must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively respond to Vice Chairman Lin's latest battle call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," eliminate various interferences, and actively participate in the mass movement of revolutionary criticism. We must stand firmly and clearly on the side of all proletarian revolutionary factions, love and support all Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and love and support all revolutionary masses. They said, in the past, we and the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the capital trusted and supported each other, cared for and helped each other, and forged a deep bond of friendship. In the future, we will stand more firmly on the side of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the capital, steadfastly, unambiguously, and wholeheartedly support you, and in any situation, be your loyal comrades-in-arms and your strong backing.

They emphasized that in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," we must truly love what the leftists love, hate what the leftists hate, think what the leftists think, worry about what the leftists worry about, and help with what the leftists need. We must honestly be students of the broad leftist masses in the locality, share the same breath and destiny with the broad leftist masses, and unite in thought and emotion. We must humbly learn from the comrades of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the capital, from the Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and from the revolutionary masses, and definitely learn all their good thoughts, good styles, and good experiences.

The meeting, amidst enthusiastic applause, read the "Agreement to Support the Army" from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards of Higher Education Institutions, and Red Guards of Middle Schools, and the "Agreement to Love the People" from the revolutionary factions of the People's Liberation Army's various headquarters, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, and the army, navy, air force, and various units stationed in Beijing, such as military academies, research institutes, and cultural and sports organizations.

Attending today's meeting were also responsible comrades from various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and various military branches: Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chuming, Zhang Lingbin, Liu Huacheng, Xiao Jinguang, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Xiuquan, Wu Faxian, Wang Huichu, Li Tianhuan, Huang Zhiyong, Tan Furen, Chen Renqi, Li Zhen, Jiang Wen, Luo Huasheng, Beijing Military District responsible comrades Zheng Weishan, Luo Yuanfa, Chen Xianrui, and Beijing Garrison responsible comrades Huang Zuozhen, Liu Shaowen, and others.
