	Warmly Welcoming the Artistic Warriors from the Anti-American Front: The Vietnam Democratic Republic Acrobatic Troupe Arrives in Beijing

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, the capital's artistic warriors warmly welcomed the Vietnam Democratic Republic Acrobatic Troupe, who came from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, to visit our country this evening at Beijing Station.

	The capital's artistic warriors held high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, as well as Chairman Mao's quotations and banners reading "Warmly Welcome the Vietnam Democratic Republic Acrobatic Troupe," gathering at Beijing Station to await the arrival of their Vietnamese comrades. At half past eleven at night, the train carrying the Vietnamese comrades slowly pulled into the station. At this moment, drums beat loudly, and applause thundered. The members of the Vietnam Acrobatic Troupe, led by Director Vu Ngoc Anh, stepped off the train. Representatives from relevant departments, including Zhou Yiping, went forward to shake hands warmly with the Vietnamese comrades, expressing their warm welcome. Representatives of revolutionary artistic warriors presented the Vietnamese comrades with Vietnamese-language editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shining Mao badges. Holding hands and waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they together shouted: "Long live the combat friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Victory to Vietnam, defeat to American imperialism!" "Seven hundred million Chinese people are determined to be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people!"

	Those who came to the station to welcome the troupe also included Deputy Chief of Mission Ly Chung Thuy of the Embassy of the Vietnam Democratic Republic in China and member of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China, Nguyen Thuan.
