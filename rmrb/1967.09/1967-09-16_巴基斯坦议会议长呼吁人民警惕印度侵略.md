Pakistani Parliament Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan on the 13th reminded the people to be vigilant against India's war preparations and the danger of another invasion of Pakistan. At a rally held by the ruling party, the Muslim League, in the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka, he said that India, under the pretext of containing China, is receiving large quantities of weapons from the Soviet Union as well as its Western allies, the United States and Britain. In fact, India is using these weapons against Pakistan, just as it did in September 1965.

    巴基斯坦议会议长呼吁人民警惕印度侵略
    据新华社讯　巴基斯坦国民议会议长阿卜杜勒·贾巴尔·汗十三日提醒人民警惕印度的战争准备和可能再次入侵巴基斯坦的危险。他在东巴基斯坦首府达卡由执政党穆斯林联盟举行的一个集会上说，印度借口遏制中国，正在接受苏联以及它的西方盟国美国和英国的大量武器。事实上，印度正在用这些武器来对付巴基斯坦，就象它在一九六五年九月已经干的那样。
