The Italian reactionary authorities have blockaded the Chinese "Lihming" cargo ship in the port of Genoa, attempting to isolate the ship completely from the outside world with a police force. However, they have completely failed.

A wave of people's support has swept through Genoa. Despite the police's various forms of persecution, large banners, leaflets, and big-character posters have appeared. The streets and squares are adorned with banners reading "Long live Mao Zedong!" and "Long live the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution!" Factories and ports proudly display giant banners praising Mao Zedong. At rallies organized by the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the crowd enthusiastically applauds every quote from Chairman Mao. After the rallies, those who do not have the "Little Red Book" rush in groups to buy it.

What does this enthusiastic scene signify? It signifies that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has transcended Chinese borders and spread throughout the world. The great victories of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution are having an increasingly profound and immense impact internationally, inspiring the fighting spirit of revolutionary people around the world.

Since the beginning of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, the liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have intensified; the revolutionary forces of the European proletariat have risen more resolutely to fight. Revolutionaries around the world have understood in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles: armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will surely achieve victory.

Italian revolutionaries have understood this truth from real struggles. After Togliatti disarmed the people's guerrilla forces that had once defeated the fascist Nazis, the leadership of the Italian Communist Party has increasingly degenerated, deeply mired in the quagmire of "peaceful transition" and class collaboration—collaboration between the exploiters and the exploited, the oppressors and the oppressed. Without a revolutionary leadership, the proletariat and the working masses suffer increasingly brutal capitalist exploitation.

When Khrushchev usurped power in the Soviet Union, pushing the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, onto the path of capitalist restoration, when the red star on the Kremlin, which had once shown the way to revolutionaries around the world, lost its luster, Italian revolutionaries asked themselves: what is to be done? But the sun rose over Tiananmen Square, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought dispelled the darkness. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has shown Italian revolutionaries, as it has revolutionaries in other countries, the path to defeating imperialism and the number one accomplice of the reactionaries in every country—revisionism. It is the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution—in this unprecedented great revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has elevated Marxism-Leninism to an entirely new stage—that has brought the slogan "Rebellion is justified" to Italy, pushing revolutionaries who have been fighting under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to break with the rule of revisionism and establish a new Marxist-Leninist party.

When the "Lihming" ship, having defeated the Italian reactionary authorities, set sail from the port, enthusiastic crowds surged towards the harbor to see off the brave crew, waving goodbye. The ship displayed a giant banner with a quote from Chairman Mao that had made the Italian authorities tremble: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries in various countries are precisely such a bunch of fools." The Italian reactionaries have lifted the rock only to drop it on their own feet. This once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere.

The "Lihming" cargo ship left the Italian port, with millions of eyes watching it depart, and millions of revolutionary hearts beating in unison with the hearts of the Chinese crew. The "Lihming" sailed eastward, towards the place where the sun rises, towards the birthplace of the great man who opened a new era for humanity—the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　太阳从天安门上升起
　　意大利　曼利奥·迪努齐
    意大利反动当局把中国“黎明”号货轮封锁在热那亚港口，妄想用一支警察部队把这艘货轮和外界完全隔绝起来，但是他们完全失败了。
    热那亚市掀起了一个人民声援的浪潮。尽管警察进行种种迫害，但是仍然出现了巨幅标语、传单和大字报。街道和广场上可以看到“毛泽东万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”的标语。工厂和港口高高地悬挂起歌颂毛泽东的巨幅标语。在意大利共产党（马列）所组织的声援集会上，每读到一段毛主席语录，群众都热烈鼓掌。集会结束后，那些还没有《毛主席语录》的人们成群结队地去争购小红书。
    这种热情的场面表明了什么呢？它表明中国无产阶级文化大革命已经越过了中国国界，传播到全世界。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，在国际上产生了越来越深刻而巨大的影响，它鼓舞着世界革命人民的斗争意志。
    从中国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的解放斗争加强了；欧洲无产阶级革命力量已经起来更坚决地进行斗争。全世界革命者在他们反帝反修的斗争中懂得了：用毛泽东思想武装起来，他们就一定会取得胜利。
    意大利革命者从现实的斗争中懂得了这个真理。从陶里亚蒂解除了曾经击败过法西斯纳粹分子的人民游击队的武装之后，意大利共产党的领导就日益蜕化变质，深深地陷入了“和平过渡”和阶级合作——剥削者和被剥削者、压迫者和被压迫者之间合作的泥潭里。无产阶级和劳动群众没有革命领导，遭受到越来越残酷的资本主义剥削。
    当赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党政大权，把第一个社会主义国家苏联推上了复辟资本主义道路的时候，当那颗曾经向全世界革命者指出过道路的克里姆林宫上的红星熄灭了光辉的时候，意大利革命者给自己提出了一个问题：怎么办？但是，太阳从天安门广场上升起来了，毛泽东思想的光辉驱散了黑暗。正是毛泽东思想给意大利革命者，就象给其他国家的革命者一样，指出了击败帝国主义和各国反动派的头号帮凶修正主义所应该走的道路。正是中国无产阶级文化大革命——在这场史无前例的大革命中，毛泽东思想把马克思列宁主义提高到一个完全崭新的阶段——将“造反有理”的口号送到了意大利，推动了已经在毛泽东思想红旗下进行斗争的革命者同修正主义的统治决裂，建立一个马克思列宁主义新党。
    当“黎明”号战胜了意大利反动当局之后起锚离港的时候，热情的人群涌向港口，向英勇的船员送行，挥手告别。货轮上悬挂了巨幅标语，上面写着曾使意大利当局胆战心惊的毛主席语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”意大利反动派也就是搬起了石头打了自己的脚。这又一次证明了毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
      “黎明”号货轮驶离了意大利港口，千万双眼睛目送着它，千万颗革命的心和中国船员的心一起跳动着。“黎明”号驶向东方，驶向太阳升起的地方，驶向开辟人类新纪元的伟人——当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志诞生的地方。
