The Voice of the People Newspaper of Albania published an editorial warmly hailing Comrade Xiehu's visit to China with a delegation.

The enduring friendship between the peoples of Albania and China will last forever.

The brilliant victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has great historical significance for the world revolution.

	NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) - The Voice of the People Newspaper of Albania published an editorial on September 24 titled "The Combat Friendship Between the Peoples of Albania and China Is Continuously Strengthened." The full text of the editorial is as follows:

	The delegation led by Comrade Muhammad Xiehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, will soon visit the People's Republic of China on a friendly visit and participate in the celebrations of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This news has filled the Albanian people with joy and excitement. This is a major event in the fraternal, combatant, and friendly relations between our two countries, parties, and governments. This visit once again embodies the noble will of the comrades-in-arms, the peoples of Albania and China, to further strengthen and temper the friendship established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism by the parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. This is a friendship between revolutionaries and comrades-in-arms who are fighting against common enemies—imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leaders—to achieve the lofty ideals of socialism and communism.

	It has been nearly a year and a half since the historic visit of the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Muhammad Xiehu in April and May of last year. The Albanian people, party, and government enthusiastically hailed this visit and unanimously supported the Albanian-Chinese Joint Statement signed in Beijing on May 11 of last year. The warm and cordial reception given to the representatives of the Albanian people in the People's Republic of China was a review of the fraternal friendship and ardent love that the Chinese people have for our people, party, and government.

	Our fraternal friendship and revolutionary cooperation have been tempered and strengthened. The mutual visits between the representatives of our two brotherly peoples have become a good tradition, which has made a great contribution to further developing and strengthening the comprehensive political, economic, and cultural ties between the two countries. The friendly visit of the Chinese party and government delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai in June last year in our country is still fresh in the hearts of our people. This visit was another great contribution to strengthening the fraternal friendship between the peoples of Albania and China, and the unity of our two parties and governments based on Marxism-Leninism.

	During the visit to the fraternal People's Republic of China, the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Muhammad Xiehu will once again express the deep friendship, boundless love, and fiery revolutionary greetings of the entire Albanian people to the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, a close friend of the Albanian people and an outstanding Marxist-Leninist. The Albanian people are proud to have such a great, loyal friend, brother, and comrade-in-arms, the great Chinese people. The friendship and comprehensive relations between our two countries are a shining example of the true internationalist fraternal ties that socialist countries should have. The fraternal friendship and close unity between our two parties, governments, and peoples are a great victory for the Albanian people and an important factor in the construction of socialism and the defense of our homeland, the preservation of Marxism-Leninism, and the revolutionary cause. Comrade Enver Hoxha said at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front, "The unbreakable Marxist-Leninist friendship binds the Albanian people, party, and government to the great People's China, to the glorious Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. Our two parties and peoples maintain this ever-strengthening friendship... We are proud to have such loyal and powerful allies and friends. No matter what storms and tempests come from anywhere, they cannot weaken and damage the unbreakable friendship between our two countries and parties, which is based on the iron principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

	The great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong also have the same friendly feelings towards our people, our party, and socialist Albania. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his congratulatory message to our Fifth Party Congress, "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe... Our revolutionary, combatant friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests. Please believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

	The Albanian party and government delegation is about to visit the People's Republic of China at a time when the great Chinese people have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the role and status of People's China on the international stage have reached unprecedented heights. The brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which began a year ago, is the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought. This cultural revolution, which is against open and covert bourgeois revisionists and all class enemies to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, is proceeding very smoothly. The flames of this revolution are sweeping away all class enemies, the Chinese Khrushchev, and are making the dreams and hopes of imperialists and modern revisionists to seize the Chinese fortress through the "Trojan Horse" from within come to naught. This revolution has become a great example of blocking the road to the restoration of capitalism and revisionism and overthrowing revisionist cliques in power anywhere. Therefore, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the victory of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought in China, not only has important historical significance for the socialist destiny of People's China but also has important historical significance for the revolution and socialist cause of the whole world. It is precisely because the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are consuming all class enemies and turning the plans of the United States and the Soviet Union to change the color of Red China into bubbles, because People's China has become an indestructible main fortress of revolution and socialism, that the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists hysterically attack, slander, and curse this revolution. This most vile slander shows their weakness and their fear and terror of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China.

	In the surging tide and victory songs of this revolution, the great Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in further strengthening the national economy and on all production fronts, further strengthening national defense potential. Evidence of this is not only the high targets achieved in the development of productive forces and the overfulfillment of industrial and agricultural production plans but also the fact that China has made significant progress in the field of nuclear weapons even during the course of the cultural revolution. The People's Republic of China's possession of nuclear weapons, hydrogen bombs, and missiles is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for all revolutionary peoples around the world who are fighting for national and social liberation, against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. With this victory, the nuclear and thermonuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism has ended, and the enemy's hope of "containing" great People's China has been buried.

	The People's Republic of China has become an impregnable main fortress of revolution and socialism in Asia and the world, a great guarantee of the freedom of all peoples, a reliable rear base and staunch supporter of the heroic Vietnamese people, and an insurmountable obstacle to the aggressive plans and shameless conspiracies of imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists. People's China stands like a giant on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, becoming the strongest supporter and great inspirer of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting in the trenches against imperialism, colonialism, and reactionary enemies for freedom, national independence, and social progress. It is precisely for this reason that the People's Republic of China is an insurmountable obstacle to American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, the number one enemy of American imperialists and Soviet revisionists. This is the reason why they are directing their arrows at great People's China today. The Johnson-Kosygin Glassboro talks are dominated by the main point of the American-Soviet plot to invade and strengthen the "encirclement" against the People's Republic of China. The political deals made during this meeting show that the Khrushchev revisionists can do any treacherous act to achieve Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. The anti-revolutionary holy alliance of the United States and the Soviet Union is first and foremost directed against China. According to the coordinated plans concocted between Washington and Moscow, American imperialists are stepping up military provocations against the People's Republic of China, while the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is frenziedly launching a comprehensive anti-China movement. The continuous violations of Chinese airspace by American military aircraft, the aggressive activities of the Indian reactionaries on the Chinese border at the instigation of the American imperialist boss and Soviet revisionist leaders, and the joint anti-China movement of international reactionaries will not frighten the Chinese giant. The enemies will suffer shameful defeats as before.

	But the Chinese giant with a population of 700 million will turn all the enemies' conspiracies and provocations into ashes. The Chinese giant is advancing victoriously on the road of revolution and socialism. No force in the world can stop the Chinese giant from marching forward. Let all the enemies of China, let the enemies of the peoples and socialism of all countries, go and be afraid, go and tremble!

	The Albanian people warmly hail the brilliant victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Our people highly appreciate the victories achieved by the People's Republic of China in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction, in the struggle for the revolutionary and peaceful cause of Asia and the world, and against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and regard them as their own victories. This sentiment and will of our people will be conveyed to the brotherly Chinese people by the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Muhammad Xiehu. Our people hail this visit and once again wish that the friendship between Albania and China will be further strengthened and last forever, for the benefit of the common cause of socialism and communism.

　　阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈欢呼谢胡同志率代表团访华
　　久经考验的阿中人民友谊万古长青
　　中国文化大革命的光辉胜利对世界革命具有重大历史意义
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十四日就阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访华发表了题为《阿中两国兄弟人民之间的战斗友谊不断巩固》的社论。社论全文如下：
    由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，即将到中华人民共和国进行友好访问，并参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的消息，使阿尔巴尼亚人民欢欣鼓舞，高兴万分。这是我们两国人民、两党和我们两个社会主义国家政府之间兄弟般的战斗的和友好关系中的一件大事。这次访问又一次体现了战友——阿中两国人民——为了进一步加强和锤炼建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的、由以恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的我们两党缔造起来的友谊的崇高意愿。这是在反对共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏联叛徒领导为中心的现代修正主义——的斗争中，争取社会主义和共产主义崇高理想取得胜利的革命者和战友之间的友谊。
    自去年四、五月份由穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团进行了历史性的访问后，已经过去将近一年半了。阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府满怀热情地欢呼这次访问，并一致拥护去年五月十一日在北京签署的阿中联合声明。阿尔巴尼亚人民的代表在中华人民共和国受到的那样热烈和亲切的接待，是中国人民对我国人民、党和政府怀有的兄弟友谊和炽烈热爱的一次检阅。
    我们的兄弟友谊和革命合作，锤炼得越来越巩固。我们两国兄弟人民的代表之间的互相访问，已经形成了良好的传统，它为进一步发展和加强两国之间政治、经济和文化的全面联系，做出了极大的贡献。由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团去年六月在我国进行的友好访问，在我国人民的心灵中仍然记忆犹新。这次访问是对加强阿中两国兄弟般的友谊、我们两党和两国政府之间的革命的、马克思列宁主义的团结一致的又一巨大贡献。
    由穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团，在访问兄弟的中华人民共和国期间，将再次向伟大的中国人民，光荣的中国共产党及其领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的知心朋友、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志，表达阿尔巴尼亚全国人民深厚的友好感情、无限的热爱和火热的革命敬礼。我国人民为有伟大的中国人民这样伟大的忠实朋友、兄弟和战友而自豪。我们两国之间的友谊和全面关系，是社会主义国家之间的关系所应该具有的、真正的国际主义兄弟般联系的光辉范例。我们两党、两国政府和两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和亲密无间的团结，是阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大胜利，是社会主义建设和保卫我们的祖国、维护马克思列宁主义和革命事业的重要因素。恩维尔
  ·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上说，“牢不可破的马克思列宁主义友谊，把阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府同伟大的人民中国，同由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的光荣的中国共产党联结在一起。我们两党和两国人民维护着这种日益增强的友谊。……我们为有这样忠实、强大的盟友和朋友而感到自豪。不管来自那里的惊涛骇浪和风暴，都不能削弱和损害我们两国和两党建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则钢铁般的基础上的牢不可破的友谊。”
    伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东主席也对我国人民、我们党、社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚怀有同样的友好感情。毛泽东同志在给我党第五次代表大会的贺电中说，“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”“我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团是在这样的时候即将前往访问中华人民共和国的：伟大的中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利，人民中国在国际舞台上的巨大作用和地位空前提高。一年前开始的无产阶级文化大革命在中国的光辉胜利，是毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。这场反对公开和隐蔽的资产阶级修正主义分子、反对所有的阶级敌人，以进一步加强无产阶级专政的无产阶级文化大革命，正在十分顺利地开展。这场革命的烈火正在从大地上吞噬、横扫一切阶级敌人、中国的赫鲁晓夫，正在使帝国主义者和现代修正主义者妄图通过“特洛伊木马”从内部夺取中国堡垒的梦想和希望遭到破灭。这场革命成为堵塞复辟资本主义和修正主义道路、推翻不管在何地当权的修正主义集团的伟大榜样。正是因为这样，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想在中国的胜利，不仅对人民中国的社会主义命运具有重要的历史意义，而且对全世界的革命和社会主义事业也具有重要的历史意义。正是因为中国无产阶级文化大革命的烈火正在吞噬所有阶级敌人，正在把美苏企图使红色中国改变颜色的计划化为泡影，因为人民中国变成了革命和社会主义的不可摧毁的主要堡垒，所以美国帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者才歇斯底里地攻击、诬蔑和咒骂这场革命。这种最下流不过的诬蔑表明了它们的虚弱，表明它们对中国共产党的无产阶级革命路线的胜利吓得要命，怕得要死。
    在这场革命的汹涌洪流和胜利的凯歌声中，伟大的中国人民在进一步加强国民经济方面、在所有生产战线上，都取得了辉煌的胜利，进一步加强了国防潜力。这方面的明证是，不仅在发展生产力和超额完成工农业生产计划方面出现了高指标，而且仅仅在文化革命的进行中间，中国就在核武器领域中又取得了重大的进展。中华人民共和国掌握了核武器、氢弹和导弹，不仅是中国人民的伟大胜利，而且是世界上所有为争取民族和社会解放、为反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派而斗争的革命人民的伟大胜利。由于这一胜利，结束了帝国主义和修正主义的核垄断和热核垄断，埋葬了敌人“遏制”伟大人民中国的希望。
    中华人民共和国已经成为亚洲和世界革命和社会主义的坚不可摧的主要堡垒，是各国人民的希望和各国人民自由的最最伟大的保障，是英雄的越南人民可靠的后方和最坚决的支持者，是帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的侵略计划和无耻阴谋的不可逾越的障碍。人民中国象巨人一样屹立在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争最前线，成了争取自由、民族独立和社会进步而在战壕中与帝国主义、殖民主义敌人进行战斗的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的最强大的支持者和伟大的鼓舞者。正是因为这样，中华人民共和国是美国帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者不可逾越的障碍，是美国帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的头号敌人。这是它们今天把矛头指向伟大人民中国的原因所在。苏美策划侵略计划、妄图扩大和加强反对中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”，是约翰逊—柯西金葛拉斯堡罗会谈压倒一切的主要点。在这次会晤中进行的政治交易表明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了实现苏美合作主宰世界，可以干出任何的背叛勾当。美苏反革命神圣同盟首先是针对中国。根据华盛顿、莫斯科之间炮制的协调计划，美国帝国主义者加紧对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团则疯狂地掀起全面的反华运动。美国军用飞机对中华人民共和国领空的连续侵犯，在美帝头子和苏修领导唆使下，印度反动派在中国边界进行的侵略活动，以及国际反动派的联合反华运动，吓不倒中国巨人。敌人将一如既往地遭到可耻失败。
    而七亿人口的中国巨人却使敌人的所有阴谋和挑衅都化为灰烬。中国巨人在革命和社会主义道路上胜利地前进。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡中国巨人向前迈进。让中国的所有敌人，让各国人民和社会主义的敌人去害怕，去颤抖吧！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心欢呼兄弟的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下所取得的辉煌胜利。我国人民高度评价中华人民共和国在无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设中、在争取亚洲和世界的革命与和平事业、反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的斗争中所取得的胜利，并把它看作是自己的胜利。我国人民的这种感情和意愿将由穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团带给兄弟的中国人民。我国人民欢呼这次访问，再次祝愿阿中两国友谊愈益加强，万古长青，以造福于社会主义和共产主义的共同事业。
