The Pakistani newspaper *Jang* today published an editorial stating that the recent armed conflict initiated by Indian troops on the Sino-Indian border is a blatant act of aggression by the Indian side.

The editorial pointed out that the Indian rulers are attempting to create such anti-China border incidents to gain substantial rewards from their foreign masters and "protectors." However, at the same time, this incident will further deteriorate the situation within India.

The editorial said that famine, soaring prices, and unemployment have already impoverished the Indian people, and the Indian rulers can no longer expect to divert the public's attention from their life-and-death issues by provoking border conflicts with China.

The editorial said that the Indian rulers' creation of such border incidents can only make the domestic situation more unstable, and the people will further rise up to oppose their rule.

The editorial in *Dawn* published in Karachi on the 11th said: The Indian rulers are playing with fire again. In 1962, when the Indian army invaded Chinese territory, China had already given the Indian ruling clique a lesson. Indira Gandhi is now repeating Nehru's mistakes, and the result is clear.

The editorial in *The Daily Times* published in Lahore yesterday pointed out: "Whenever India's economic situation worsens and the Indian ruling class feels unable to suppress the anger of the Indian people, they start shouting about the so-called threat from China or Pakistan. This has become a routine for India."

The editorial said that the Indian rulers "want to calm their starving people by fabricating the claim that the Chinese have launched an attack, attempting to prevent the people from rising up against their rulers." At the same time, the Indian rulers are trying to spread rumors about a new Chinese attack "to obtain more military and economic aid from the United States and other Western countries at an unusually fast pace."

The editorial emphasized that the Indian rulers' expansionist tactics will not succeed and will not be able to deceive the world's people for long.

According to a report by *The Pakistan Times* on the 13th, Pakistani political observers said that the Indian ruling clique's military provocations on the Sino-Indian border starting on the 11th of this month are aimed at obtaining more military aid from the United States and the Soviet Union.

They pointed out that Indian Deputy Prime Minister Desai is currently in the United States holding talks with US President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk. The United States has already promised to provide India with an additional 100 million tons of grain. This way, the United States has agreed to provide India with a total of 610 million tons of grain this year, allowing India to divert its financial resources to military purposes.

The observers said that to obtain more weapons from the Soviet Union, Indian Defense Minister Swaran Singh will soon depart for Moscow.

The editorial in *The Nation* published in Rawalpindi on the 13th said that the Indian rulers' military provocations against China are aimed at justifying their continued implementation of martial law and the suppression of the Indian people who are organizing to resist reactionary rule. The Indian rulers are trying to create a tense situation similar to the 1962 Sino-Indian border conflict to obtain large amounts of funds, weapons, and other equipment from Western countries.

The editorial said that India's war on the Sino-Indian border is also an excuse to increase troops in Sikkim, thereby further controlling this small country.

The editorial warned that the Indian rulers' military provocations against China are playing with fire and are doomed to fail.

    巴基斯坦舆论谴责印军向中国边防部队发动进攻
    印度反动派的武装挑衅是赤裸裸的侵略
    印度政府猖狂反华目的是向美帝苏修邀功领赏
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十二日电　拉瓦尔品第《战斗报》今天发表社论说，印度军队最近在中锡边境挑起的武装冲突，是印度方面进行的赤裸裸的侵略。
    社论指出，印度统治者企图通过制造这种反华的边境事件，从他们的外国主子和“保护人”那里得到一大笔犒赏，但是，与此同时，这一事件将使印度国内的情况进一步恶化。
    社论说，饥荒、物价飞涨、失业，已经使印度人民贫困不堪，印度统治者再也不能指望通过挑起同中国的边境冲突，来转移群众对他们的生死攸关问题的注意力。
    社论说，印度统治者制造这种边境事件，只能使其国内情况更加动荡不安，人民将进一步起来反对他们的统治。
    卡拉奇《自由报》十一日发表社论说：印度统治者又在玩火了。一九六二年印度军队入侵中国领土时，中国已经教训过印度统治集团。英迪拉·甘地现在重复尼赫鲁的错误，其结果是很清楚的。
    拉合尔《东方报》昨天发表社论指出：“每当印度经济状况的恶化无法抑制，印度统治阶级感到无法平息印度人民的愤怒时，便开始叫嚷所谓中国或巴基斯坦的威胁，这对印度来说已经成为惯例了。”
    社论说，印度统治者“想通过捏造中国人发动进攻的说法使它的正在挨饿的人民平静下来，妄图使人民不会想到起来造他们的统治者的反。”同时，印度统治者企图通过散布关于中国发动新的进攻的谣言，“以异乎寻常的速度从美国和其他西方国家得到更多的军事和经济援助。”
    社论强调说，印度统治者玩弄的扩张主义手法，决不能得逞，也决不能长期欺骗世界人民。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十三日电　据《巴基斯坦时报》十三日报道，巴基斯坦的政治观察家们说，印度统治集团九月十一日起在中锡边界向中国进行军事挑衅，是为了从美国和苏联得到更多的军事援助。
    他们指出，印度副总理德赛正在美国同美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克进行会谈。美国已经保证再向印度提供一百万吨谷物。这样一来，美国今年总共答应向印度提供六百一十万吨谷物，使印度能够把它的财源转用于军事目的。
    观察家们说，为了从苏联得到更多的武器，印度国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格不久将动身去莫斯科。
    拉瓦尔品第《建设报》十三日发表社论说，印度统治者对中国进行军事挑衅，是为了证明它在国内继续实行紧急状态，镇压正在组织起来反抗反动统治的印度人民是有理的。印度统治者竭力制造类似一九六二年中印边界的紧张局势，以便从西方国家获得大量资金、武器及其他装备。
    社论说，印度在中锡边界对中国发动战争，也是为了找借口增兵锡金，从而进一步控制这个小国。
    社论警告说，印度统治者对中国进行军事挑衅，是玩火，是注定要失败的。
