Mobilize to Win the Battle of the Autumn Harvest!

The autumn harvest season in China's rural areas has arrived. Early autumn crops are being harvested, and it is shaping up to be a bountiful year. Late autumn crops are growing well, and a good harvest is in sight.

This is a glorious victory on the agricultural front, following the great victory of the summer grain harvest, amidst the triumphant songs of the great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

This brilliant victory is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country. It is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism in the Soviet Union, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

We are filled with revolutionary fervor as we celebrate this great victory. We extend our revolutionary greetings to the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside who have made significant contributions in implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Now, the task for the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside is to use the great criticism of the revolution as a driving force, to emphasize proletarian politics, to boost revolutionary enthusiasm, to concentrate efforts, to do a good job in the autumn harvest, and to ensure that the harvest is good, the sowing is good, and the plowing is good. We must resolutely secure this year's bountiful harvest and lay a solid foundation for next year's summer grain harvest.

We must focus on grain, cotton, and cloth. Focusing on these three items is of great significance for promoting the development of the country's overall production and construction and for achieving "preparation for war, preparation for famine, and for the people." To focus on these three items, we must concentrate our efforts on the autumn harvest at this time.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not miss the agricultural season, which means allowing farmers to stop all meetings and mobilizations unrelated to agriculture during the busy agricultural season."

During the busy autumn harvest season, the revolutionary criticism in the countryside should be conducted outside of production time. We must insist on working during the day and engaging in revolution during the evening and spare time, and not go to the cities to interfere with the Cultural Revolution there. Other units and factions in the cities should not interfere with the Cultural Revolution in the countryside.

The leadership of production at all levels in the countryside must take on the responsibility of leading the revolution and promoting production. They must seriously consult with the poor and lower-middle peasants and all laborers to organize the autumn harvest work well. All revolutionary mass organizations in the countryside must support the work of the production leadership at all levels.

All policies in the countryside that have not been newly regulated by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council should continue to be implemented according to the original regulations.

Workers in the financial and commercial sectors and the transportation sector must vigorously support the autumn harvest, do a good job in purchasing agricultural products, and do a good job in transporting industrial products to the countryside.

In short, we must have a good revolution, good production, good harvesting, good preservation, and good distribution.

Winning the autumn harvest is not only a struggle against nature but also a serious class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Create havoc, fail, create more havoc, fail again, until they are utterly ruined—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

The class enemies are indeed acting according to this logic, making their final struggles. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in collusion with the ghosts and snakes in society, are plotting various schemes to resist the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and to sabotage agricultural production. They deliberately incite antagonistic sentiments among the laboring masses and deliberately disrupt the production order. In some places, capitalist forces are fanning the winds of counter-revolutionary economism, attempting to damage the great achievements of socialist construction. The masses in the people's communes, production brigades, and production teams must be highly vigilant against the class enemies' sabotage activities, maintain a clear mind, and expose the enemies' plots at any time.

The People's Liberation Army soldiers who have made great achievements in supporting agriculture must create new merits for the people in supporting and protecting the autumn harvest.

"Look at the rippling waves of rice and millet, heroes everywhere at dusk." Comrades, poor and lower-middle peasants, and comrades, revolutionary cadres in the countryside, let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, mobilize all forces, seriously grasp the revolution, promote production, win the battle of the autumn harvest, and welcome the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and socialist construction in the countryside.

### 动员起来，打好三秋这一仗！

    动员起来，打好三秋这一仗！
    我国农村三秋大忙季节已经到来。早秋作物正在收割，是一个较大的丰产年景。晚秋作物长势良好，丰产在望。
    这是在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大批判、大斗争取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，继夏粮大丰收以后，农业战线上取得的又一辉煌的胜利。
    这个光辉的胜利对全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众是一个极大的鼓舞，对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义以及蒋介石匪帮和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是一个沉重的打击。
    我们满怀革命的激情欢呼这一伟大的胜利。我们向在贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，作出了重大贡献的贫下中农和农村革命干部，致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼。
    现在，贫下中农和农村革命干部的任务是，以革命的大批判为动力，突出无产阶级政治，鼓足革命干劲，集中力量，搞好三秋，作到收好、种好、耕好，坚决把今年的丰收果实全部拿到手，并为明年的夏粮丰收打下坚实可靠的基础。
    我们必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧。抓紧这三项，对于促进我国整个生产建设的发展，对于实现“备战、备荒、为人民”，具有极为重大的意义。要抓紧这三项，在当前，就要集中力量，搞好三秋。
    毛主席教导我们：“不违农时，即在农忙时允许农民停止一切无关农业的开会与动员。”
    在三秋大忙季节，农村革命的大批判，要在生产以外的时间进行，要坚持白天搞生产，业余闹革命，晚上闹革命，就地闹革命，不要进城去干预那里的文化大革命。外单位和城里各派别也不要到农村去干预那里的文化大革命。
    农村各级生产领导班子，要切实担负起抓革命、促生产的领导责任，认真同贫下中农商量，同一切劳动群众商量，把三秋工作组织好。农村各革命群众组织要支持各级生产领导班子的工作。
    农村中的各项政策，凡是党中央、国务院没有作出新规定的，一律按照原来的规定执行。
    财贸、交通部门的职工，要大力支援三秋，做好农产品的收购工作，做好调运工业品下乡的工作。
    总之，要革命得好，生产得好，收割得好，保存得好，分配得好。
    搞好三秋不仅是一场同自然的斗争，也是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    阶级敌人正是按照这个逻辑行事的，他们正在作垂死的挣扎。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，施展种种阴谋诡计，妄图对抗无产阶级文化大革命，妄图破坏农业生产。他们故意要煽动劳动群众之间的对立情绪，故意要扰乱生产秩序。有的地方，资本主义势力又在煽动反革命经济主义的歪风，妄想损害社会主义建设的伟大成果。对于阶级敌人的这些破坏活动，人民公社、生产大队、生产队的群众必须百倍提高革命警惕，保持清醒的头脑，随时揭穿敌人的阴谋。
    在支援农业的工作中做出了巨大成绩的人民解放军指战员，要在支援三秋和保护三秋的工作中为人民立新功。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”贫下中农同志们，农村革命干部同志们，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，动员一切力量，认真地抓革命，促生产，打好三秋这一仗，迎接农村无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义生产建设的新高潮。
