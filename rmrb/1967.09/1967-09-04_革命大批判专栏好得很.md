The Revolutionary Criticism Column is Excellent

In the midst of the nationwide campaign to criticize the leading clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary masses of the three military units stationed in Beijing, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have used the sharp weapon of big-character posters to launch a fierce criticism against the leading clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have turned the criticism columns into classrooms for learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the revolutionary criticism columns set up by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. These columns are magnificent and fully display the united hatred of the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people against the leading clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They fervently express the boundless love and reverence of the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone praises the criticism columns as excellent.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Chairman Mao calls on us: the army and all sectors should criticize the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary criticism is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao. It is the key to thoroughly criticizing, exposing, and overthrowing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on all fronts, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary criticism columns are a great invention by the broad revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are another sign of the extensive and in-depth development of the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is the basis for construction. With destruction as the priority, construction is also included." The revolutionary criticism columns are good classrooms for thoroughly establishing proletarian thought and Mao Zedong Thought, for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, for propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and for establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary criticism columns have the broadest mass character. They organize and mobilize hundreds of millions of critics to point out the way, write passionately, concentrate firepower, and launch a large-scale encirclement of the leading clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, exposing their heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought in broad daylight, making them sink into the vast sea of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary criticism columns are rich in content, large in capacity, lively in form, and varied in style. They combine the serious political, ideological, and theoretical struggle with forms that the masses love to see, making everyone willing to set them up, willing to read them, and concerned about them, and benefiting from them.

In the revolutionary criticism, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and set up and run well the revolutionary criticism columns. Under the principle of thrift in revolution, we must make the revolutionary criticism columns more solid and more effective.

The revolutionary masses of the three military units stationed in Beijing set up and run well the criticism columns, relying on the millions of red hearts that are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and have launched a mass revolutionary criticism against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, setting an example for all units of our army. The broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army should enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's latest call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dog," and with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, throw themselves into the revolutionary criticism movement and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

专栏：解放军报社论

　　革命大批判专栏好得很
    在全国展开对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判高潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的驻京三军无产阶级革命派，以革命大字报的锋利武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开猛烈批判，把大批判专栏变成学习和宣传毛泽东思想的课堂。现在，首都无产阶级革命派举办的街头大批判专栏，如雨后春笋般地涌现出来。这些专栏，气势磅礴，充分展现了亿万军民对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的同仇敌忾；热烈地表达了亿万军民对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限崇敬。人人称赞大批判专栏好得很。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”毛主席号召我们：军队和各行各业都要批判资产阶级。革命的大批判，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在各条战线上的代理人批深、批透、批倒、批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的关键所在。革命大批判专栏，是广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命运动中的一个发明创造，是文化大革命广泛深入地向前发展的又一个标志。
    毛主席经常教导我们：不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。革命的大批判专栏，是大立无产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席著作的好课堂，是宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的有力武器，是树立毛泽东思想绝对权威的重要阵地。
    革命的大批判专栏，具有最广泛的群众性，它组织动员起亿万个群众批判家，指点江山，激扬文字，集中火力，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开规模巨大的围剿，把他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行暴露在光天化日之下，使他们陷进无产阶级文化大革命的汪洋大海。
    革命的大批判专栏内容丰富容量大，形式活泼花样多，千字文，诗画配，使严肃的政治、思想、理论的斗争同群众喜闻乐见的形式得到了统一，大家爱办，大家爱看，大家都关心，大家受教育。
    我们在革命大批判中，要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大办革命大批判专栏，办好革命大批判专栏。在节约闹革命的原则下，把革命大批判专栏办得更扎实，更讲究实效。
    驻京三军无产阶级革命派大办大批判专栏，办好大批判专栏，靠的是无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的千万颗红心。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，展开了群众性的革命大批判，为我军各部队作出了榜样。我军广大指战员，要热烈响应林彪副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的最新号召，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，以最大的革命热情，投入革命的大批判运动，为无产阶级文化大革命作出新的贡献！
                                              （九月四日）
