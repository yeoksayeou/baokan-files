	The Australian "Vanguard" Newspaper Condemns Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal of the World Revolution, Emphasizes that Anti-Imperialism Must Include Anti-Revisionism
	The World Revolution Will Advance Rapidly Through the Struggle Against Revisionism

	New China News Agency (Xinhua) reports from Melbourne: The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the "Vanguard" newspaper, published an article in its August 31 issue stating that the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the world revolutionary people is becoming increasingly apparent. This further underscores the necessity of anti-revisionism in the struggle against imperialism, particularly American imperialism. The article emphasizes that the struggle against revisionism must be an indispensable part of the struggle against imperialism.

	The article points out that Soviet revisionists, using the banner of Lenin's party, "serve imperialism in the most disgusting and shameless way on an international scale. ... However, undoubtedly, their capital of deception is disappearing. To sabotage the revolutionary and national liberation movements, they have to come out more openly and reveal their true selves. Now, few people deny the collusion between American imperialism and Soviet revisionism."

	The article states, "The betrayal of the Soviet revisionists against the liberation struggle of the Arab people is still fresh in everyone's memory. Under the so-called 'Tashkent spirit,' they sold out the Pakistani people to the Indian ruling class supported by American imperialism. Another example is Soviet revisionist Podgorny's public praise of the ruthless exploitation by the Italian monopoly capital Fiat, which is directly supported by the Soviet Union to exploit the Soviet people. In the frontline of the struggle against American imperialism, Vietnam, Soviet revisionists have never stopped their treacherous plots against the Vietnamese people. Johnson and Kosygin have shown themselves to be brothers."

	The article says, "The Soviet revisionist leadership not only betrays the world revolutionary people and the Soviet people by restoring capitalism at home but also, to help the American imperialists, supports revisionist parties in many countries, obstructing and sabotaging the revolutionary movements in these countries. The article cites the example of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique: 'The revisionist clique within the Japanese Communist Party insists on a pure parliamentary line. That is, implementing Khrushchev's theory of peaceful transition to socialism. This means long-term American control over Japan. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique attacks Japanese Marxist-Leninists, expels them from the party, slanders them, and beats them. The Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique takes an anti-China stance. This can only paralyze the revolutionary activities of the Japanese people. These revisionists, in the name of legality, seek 'peace' and take the parliamentary road to capitalism.'"

	The article states, "The correct line in opposition to this revisionist line is to promote and welcome the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. The article points out that this struggle is developing. In the process of this development, more and more people are freeing themselves from the influence of revisionism. The article concludes: 'The revolutionary movement is advancing and will advance rapidly through the lively practical struggle against revisionism.'

    澳《先锋报》谴责苏修背叛世界革命，强调反帝必须反修
    世界革命将在反修斗争中飞速前进
    新华社讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》在八月三十一日出版的一期中发表文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团对世界革命人民的背叛行径越来越明显，这就更加说明，反帝必须反修。文章强调必须把反修斗争作为反对帝国主义，首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争的不可缺少的一部分。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义者利用列宁党的旗帜，“以最令人作呕和最无耻的方式在国际规模上为帝国主义效劳。……但是，无疑，他们骗人的资本正在消失。为了破坏革命和民族解放事业，他们不得不更公开地、以他们本来的面目跳出来。现在，很少有人否认美帝国主义和苏联修正主义之间的勾结”。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者“对阿拉伯人民解放斗争的背叛，对每一个人说来都是记忆犹新的。在所谓‘塔什干精神’之下向美帝国主义支持的印度统治阶级出卖巴基斯坦人民是又一个例子。苏联修正主义者波德戈尔内公开赞扬意大利大垄断资本菲亚特的无情剥削，而正是这个垄断资本得到苏联的直接支持来剥削苏联人民。在反对美帝国主义斗争的最前哨越南，苏联修正主义者一刻也没有停止过背叛越南人民的阴谋。约翰逊和柯西金已经表明是一对亲兄弟。”
    文章说，苏修领导集团不仅自己背叛世界革命人民和苏联人民，在国内实行资本主义复辟，而且为了帮助美帝，还在许多国家扶植修正主义的党，阻挠和破坏这些国家的革命运动。文章举日共修正主义集团为例说：“日共党内的修正主义集团坚持奉行一条不折不扣的议会路线。那就是，把赫鲁晓夫关于向社会主义和平过渡的那一套付诸实施。这就意味着美帝长期控制日本。日共修正主义集团攻击日本的马列主义者，把他们‘开除’出党，诽谤他们，殴打他们。日共修正主义集团采取了反华立场。这只能瘫痪日本人民的革命活动。这些修正主义者本着合法主义，谋求‘和平’，走资本主义的议会道路。”
    文章说，与这条修正主义路线针锋相对的正确路线是推动和欢迎各国人民的革命斗争。文章指出，这场斗争正在发展。在斗争发展的过程中，越来越多的人摆脱修正主义的影响。文章最后说：“革命运动在前进，并将在反对修正主义的生动的实际斗争中飞速前进。”
