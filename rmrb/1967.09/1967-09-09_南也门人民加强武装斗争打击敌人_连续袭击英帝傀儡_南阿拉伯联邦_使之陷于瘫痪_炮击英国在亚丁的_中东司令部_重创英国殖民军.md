South Yemen people strengthen armed struggle to strike the enemy
Continuous attacks on the British puppet "Federation of South Arabia" paralyze it
Shelling of the British "Middle East Command" in Aden severely damages British colonial forces

According to a report from Cairo by Xinhua News Agency, the nationalists in occupied South Yemen have recently launched consecutive attacks on the "Federation of South Arabia" backed by British imperialism, effectively paralyzing this puppet "federation." On August 28, the nationalists in occupied South Yemen arrested the chairman of the "Federation of South Arabia Supreme Council," Karadi, in the capital of the Lower Yafa Sultanate, Jarr, and seized the "government" institutions in Jarr. At the same time, the nationalists have taken control of the Aden radio station and the situation in eight member states of the "federation."

Not long ago, the nationalists in South Yemen also took over the capital of the Fadhli Sultanate, Zinjibar.

The "Federation of South Arabia" is a puppet entity pieced together by British imperialism since 1959, consisting of 16 sultanates and sheikhdoms in the "Aden Colony" and the "Aden Protectorate."

British imperialism's plot to grant this "federation" a false "independence" to maintain its shaky colonial rule in the region has been strongly opposed by the people of South Yemen. In recent years, the people of South Yemen have intensified their armed struggle in Aden and other parts of South Yemen, dealing heavy blows to the British colonialists. On August 26, the nationalists also used mortars to attack the British "Middle East Command" in Aden, and previously shelled the residence of the British High Commissioner in Aden, Duvalier.

　　南也门人民加强武装斗争打击敌人
　　连续袭击英帝傀儡“南阿拉伯联邦”使之陷于瘫痪
　　炮击英国在亚丁的“中东司令部”重创英国殖民军
    据新华社开罗电　被占领的南也门民族主义者最近接连袭击英帝国主义扶植的“南阿拉伯联邦”，使这个傀儡“联邦”实际上陷于瘫痪。被占领的南也门民族主义者八月二十八日在下雅法苏丹国首府贾尔逮捕了“南阿拉伯联邦最高委员会”主席卡拉迪，并占领贾尔的“政府”机构。同时，民族主义者已经控制了亚丁电台，并控制了“联邦”八个成员国的局势。
    不久前，南也门的民族主义者还接管了法兹利苏丹国首府津吉巴尔。
    “南阿拉伯联邦”是英帝国主义从一九五九年起陆续拼凑起来的，它包括“亚丁殖民地”和“亚丁保护地”的十六个苏丹国和酋长国。
    英帝国主义为了维护它在这个地区的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治而加紧策划的给这个“联邦”以假“独立”的阴谋，遭到了南也门人民的强烈反对。今年来南也门人民在亚丁和南也门其他地区加强了武装斗争，给英国殖民者以沉重打击。八月二十六日，民族主义者还用迫击炮袭击英国在亚丁的“中东司令部”，并在这以前炮击英国驻亚丁高级专员杜维廉的住所。
