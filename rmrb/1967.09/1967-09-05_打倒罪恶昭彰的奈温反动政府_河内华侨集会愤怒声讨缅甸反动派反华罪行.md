	Overthrow the Criminally Obvious Ne Win Reactionary Government
	Hanoi Overseas Chinese Hold Meeting to Angrily Denounce the Anti-Chinese Crimes of the Myanmar Reactionaries

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi — Recently, representatives from various circles of overseas Chinese in Hanoi held a meeting to angrily denounce the anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese policies of the Ne Win reactionary government in Myanmar, which has carried out mass killings, mass arrests, and mass persecutions of patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar.

	The responsible person from the Hanoi Overseas Chinese Association emphasized in his speech at the meeting that it is completely correct for patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar to study the works of Chairman Mao, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is their right and their duty. He said that the just struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar will surely achieve final victory, and the Ne Win reactionary government will surely suffer a disgraceful defeat.

	The representatives at the meeting spoke one after another, strongly protesting against the mad anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government in Myanmar. At the same time, they expressed their determination to learn from the brave fighting spirit of the overseas Chinese in Myanmar, to study the works of Chairman Mao diligently, to promote the revolutionization of their thoughts, and to contribute to the cause of resisting America and saving the nation in Vietnam.

	At the end of the meeting, the representatives, filled with indignation, raised their arms and shouted slogans such as: "Firmly support the just struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar against the persecution of the Ne Win reactionary government!" "Overthrow the criminally obvious Ne Win reactionary government!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!"

	The representatives from various circles also shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
