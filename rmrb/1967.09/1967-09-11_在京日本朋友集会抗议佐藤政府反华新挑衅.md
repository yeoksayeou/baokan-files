More than 200 Japanese friends and Japanese Red Guards in Beijing held a rally today to strongly protest against Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan and the Sato government's dispatch of police and right-wing thugs to assault staff of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Japan and Chinese journalists in Japan. The Japanese friends participating in the rally solemnly pointed out that the anti-China incident in Tokyo this time by the Sato government is not accidental but a planned and organized new provocation against China, which is an important part of the Sato government's following the U.S. imperialists and collaborating with Soviet revisionists to oppose China.

The resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that this incident in Tokyo further exposed the Sato government's face of following the U.S. imperialists, collaborating with Soviet revisionists, and opposing China. The Sato government, together with the Japanese Communist Party revisionists who cater to them, are at the forefront of opposing China. This incident is a conspiracy plotted by those who fear the great thought of Mao Zedong and fear that the Japanese people will understand the truth about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The resolution strongly demands that the Sato government immediately apologize publicly to the Chinese people; punish the police and commanders who instigated this incident; ensure that similar incidents do not happen again; and immediately stop all anti-China activities.

Seven representatives of Japanese friends visiting and working in Beijing and a representative of the Japanese Red Guards in Beijing spoke at the meeting. They strongly condemned the Sato government's new crimes against China, expressed sympathy to the Chinese staff in Japan who bravely fought against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and expressed their resolute support for the strong protest made by the Liaozhengzhi Office's Liaison Office in Tokyo to the Sato government.

During the rally, the Japanese friends repeatedly shouted slogans: "Down with the Sato government of Japan!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with the Japanese revisionist group of Miyamoto!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

    在京日本朋友集会抗议佐藤政府反华新挑衅
    据新华社十日讯　在北京的日本朋友和日本红卫兵共二百多人今天举行集会，强烈抗议日本政府首相佐藤荣作“访问”台湾，强烈抗议佐藤政府派出警察和右翼暴徒，殴打廖承志办事处驻日人员和中国驻日记者的法西斯暴行。参加集会的日本朋友严正指出，日本佐藤政府这次在东京制造的反华事件，绝不是偶然的，是在佐藤“访问”台湾时进行的一次有计划、有组织的新的反华挑衅，是日本佐藤政府追随美帝、联合苏修反华的一个重要组成部分。会上通过的决议指出，这次在东京发生的事件，进一步暴露了佐藤政府追随美帝、联合苏修、敌视中国的面目；佐藤政府正与迎合他们的日共修正主义分子一起，走在反华的最前列。这次事件就是那些害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，害怕日本人民了解中国无产阶级文化大革命真相的人所策划的阴谋。决议强烈要求佐藤政府立刻向中国人民公开赔礼道歉；惩罚制造这次事件的警察与指挥者；保证今后不再发生类似事件；立刻停止一切反华活动。
    在北京访问和工作的日本朋友们的七位代表和在北京的日本红卫兵代表，在会上讲了话。他们强烈谴责日本佐藤政府的反华新罪行，向英勇抗击美日反动派的中国驻日人员表示慰问，表示坚决支持廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所向日本佐藤政府提出的强烈抗议。
    大会进行中，日本朋友不断地高呼：“打倒日本佐藤政府！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒日本宫本修正主义集团！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
