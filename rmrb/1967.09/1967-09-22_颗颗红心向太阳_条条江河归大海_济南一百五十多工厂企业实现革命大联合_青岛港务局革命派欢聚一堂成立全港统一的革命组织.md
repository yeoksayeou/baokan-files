Every red heart turns to the sun, every river and stream flows into the sea. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the factories and enterprises of Jinan resolutely carry out the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, with a spirit of "seizing the day and the hour," swiftly launching a new high tide of revolutionary great unity to welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the past three days, the city has seen a surge of triumphant songs and joyous reports, with 159 factories and enterprises achieving revolutionary great unity.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a beacon, illuminating the path forward for the working class of Jinan. They immediately studied and discussed, resolutely carrying out the instructions. The Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters Jinan General Headquarters convened a meeting of the leaders of the grassroots revolutionary mass organizations to deeply study and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly smashing the "self" and establishing the "public," removing ideological obstacles for achieving revolutionary great unity. "We will do as Chairman Mao says." This is the common vow of the working class in Jinan. A new high tide of revolutionary great unity quickly swept through the factories and enterprises. In recent days, the city has been filled with joy and excitement, with drums beating and teams reporting revolutionary great unity one after another. The leader of the "Red Storm" in Jinan Plastic Factory No. 1 previously believed that his team was large and powerful, insisting that revolutionary great unity must be achieved with him as the main force; the leader of another revolutionary mass organization, the "United Brigade," feared that his team would be "swallowed" by others and refused to participate. As a result, the two revolutionary mass organizations remained split for a long time. This time, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the leader of the "Red Storm" realized that his views did not align with Mao Zedong Thought and actively checked his erroneous thoughts of sectarianism and factionalism with the leader of the "United Brigade." The leader of the "United Brigade" was deeply moved and immediately made a self-criticism. The two revolutionary mass organizations finally united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Some revolutionary mass organizations in Jinan Hardware Company and the Jinan Shoes and Hats Garment System previously had erroneous tendencies such as "contesting seats," and revolutionary great unity could not be achieved for a long time. Now, they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overcome selfish thoughts and quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. They deeply feel that we revolutionaries have a common enemy and a common struggle goal. Only by uniting and closely rallying around each other, fighting together, can we better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fiercely strike the enemy, and ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses eagerly demand revolutionary great unity, and the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations resolutely stand at the forefront of the mass movement. This is a characteristic of the factories and enterprises in Jinan achieving revolutionary great unity. Many leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in factories and enterprises repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and expressed their determination to stand at the forefront of the masses, leading the masses forward, and being models in executing Chairman Mao's instructions. The three revolutionary mass organizations in Jinan Egg Products Factory previously had differing views and practices on certain specific issues and had been at odds for a long time. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary masses eagerly demanded great unity. The leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations in this factory also sat together, jointly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," using Mao Zedong Thought to examine and check their erroneous thoughts of "only my revolution," unanimously expressing their determination to be promoters of revolutionary great unity. As a result, the revolutionary great unity of the entire factory was quickly achieved.

Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Shandong Tractor Repair Factory, who have achieved revolutionary great unity, said in summarizing their experiences and lessons: The reason why our factory's revolutionary mass organizations have been in a state of opposition for a long time is that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party have fanned the winds of evil and kindled the fires of heresy. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold and not be fooled by the class enemy again. We must unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, do a good job of revolutionary great criticism, consolidate revolutionary great unity, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Tonight, more than 3,000 proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers from the factories and enterprises in Jinan held a grand rally to launch a new high tide of revolutionary great criticism and revolutionary great unity. Leaders from the Shandong Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan, and the Shandong Military Region, as well as the Jinan Revolutionary Committee, attended the meeting. Yang Dezhi, the first deputy director of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee and the leader of the Jinan forces, spoke at the meeting. He called on the working class of Jinan to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He urged them to be models in consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and achieve new victories. The meeting issued an initiative to the broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses throughout the province, calling on them to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and swiftly launch a new high tide of revolutionary great unity.

According to a report from the *Qingdao Daily*, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Qingdao Port Bureau have acted most swiftly and resolutely in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under the impetus of the high tide of revolutionary great unity among the working class in Shanghai and with the concern and assistance of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army, they have, with a spirit of "seizing the day and the hour," achieved revolutionary great unity today. They have established a unified revolutionary organization for the entire port—the Qingdao Revolutionary Workers' Headquarters Port Bureau Joint Command Department. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

During the "January Revolution" storm, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Qingdao Port Bureau united to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, shouldering the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. Revolution and production have shown a prosperous and flourishing situation. Later, due to differences in views on certain issues within the revolutionary ranks that were not promptly resolved, they split into two factions, resulting in a long-term "internal war" situation.

After the People's Liberation Army entered Qingdao Port, on the one hand, they conducted in-depth investigations and meticulous research among the masses, and on the other hand, they organized revolutionary workers, especially the leaders of the two factions, to study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" and relevant editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, carrying out active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works. Through active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary ranks throughout the port, especially the old workers, eagerly demanded revolutionary great unity. They said: The two factions are only fighting "internal wars," revolution cannot be done well, and production cannot be improved, letting the enemy laugh at us, we are very distressed, and as revolutionaries, we should quickly unite.

After the latest instructions of our great commander Chairman Mao were conveyed, they greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionaries of Qingdao Port. They wrote Chairman Mao's latest instructions on big-character posters and posted them all over Qingdao Port. Many revolutionary workers also copied Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their red *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and studied and read them every day. The stationed People's Liberation Army organized everyone, especially the leaders of the two factions, to repeatedly and seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many revolutionary workers said at the study and discussion meetings that Chairman Mao best understands our feelings, and Chairman Mao's words have touched our hearts. The fundamental interests of the working class are the same, and there is not even half a reason not to unite. Everyone broke away from selfishness and established public-mindedness, checked their erroneous thoughts of insisting on "me as the core" to achieve great unity, and resolutely expressed their determination to overcome sectarianism and factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, prioritize revolutionary interests, and swiftly achieve revolutionary great unity. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the two factions quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

Today, the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the port held a grand rally on the wharf to celebrate the revolutionary great unity of the entire port. The port was filled with red flags and drums, and the atmosphere was festive.

    颗颗红心向太阳　条条江河归大海
　　济南一百五十多工厂企业实现革命大联合
　　青岛港务局革命派欢聚一堂成立全港统一的革命组织
    新华社济南二十一日电　颗颗红心向太阳，条条江河归大海。济南市工厂企业广大无产阶级革命派最坚决地贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速掀起了革命大联合的新高潮，迎接中华人民共和国成立十八周年。最近三天来，凯歌阵阵，喜报频传，全市已经有一百五十九个工厂企业实现了革命大联合。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的这一最新指示象一盏指路明灯，照亮了济南市工人阶级的前进道路。他们立即学习讨论，坚决贯彻执行。山东革命工人造反总指挥部济南总指挥部，召开了基层革命群众组织负责人会议，深入学习、领会毛主席的最新指示，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，为实现革命的大联合扫除了思想上的障碍。“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干。”这是济南市工人阶级的共同誓言。一个革命大联合的新高潮很快在工厂企业中掀了起来。连日来，全市到处喜气洋洋，锣鼓喧天，大联合报喜队络绎不绝。济南塑料一厂“红色风暴”的负责人，过去认为自己的队伍大，力量强，一直坚持实现革命大联合必须以自己为主；厂里另一个革命群众组织“联合兵团”的负责人，则怕自己队伍被别人“吃”掉，拒绝参加。结果，两个革命群众组织长期处于分裂状态。这次，大家学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，“红色风暴”的负责人认识到自己的观点不符合毛泽东思想，便主动地向“联合兵团”的负责人检查了自己的小团体主义和宗派主义等错误思想。“联合兵团”的负责人很受感动，也立即作了自我批评。两个革命群众组织，终于在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来了。济南市五金公司和济南鞋帽服装系统的一些革命群众组织，前一时期都存在“争席位”等错误倾向，大联合迟迟不能实现。现在，他们都以毛泽东思想为武器，克服私心杂念，迅速地实现了革命的大联合。他们深有体会地说：我们革命派有共同的敌人，共同的斗争目标，只有联合起来，紧密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，才能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠狠地打击敌人，保证无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
      广大革命群众迫切要求实现革命大联合，革命群众组织负责人坚决站在群众运动的前头，这是济南市工厂企业实现革命大联合的一个特点。许多工厂企业的革命群众组织负责人反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，纷纷表示要站在群众前头，领导群众前进，做执行毛主席指示的模范。济南蛋品厂的三个革命群众组织，以前在某些具体问题上看法和做法不一致，长期闹对立。在学习毛主席的最新指示以后，广大革命群众迫切要求实现大联合。这个厂的三个革命群众组织负责人也坐到一起，共同学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，用毛泽东思想对照检查了自己“唯我革命”等错误思想，一致表示，坚决做革命大联合的促进派。结果，很快实现了全厂的革命大联合。
    在毛主席最新指示光辉照耀下，实现了革命大联合的山东拖拉机修配厂的无产阶级革命派，在总结经验教训时说：我们厂的革命群众组织所以长期处于对立局面，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽阴风、点邪火所造成的。我们必须百倍提高革命警惕性，再不要上阶级敌人的当。我们一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，搞好革命的大批判，巩固革命的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    今晚，济南市工厂企业的三千多名无产阶级革命派和革命职工，隆重举行了掀起革命大批判和革命大联合新高潮的誓师大会。山东省革命委员会、人民解放军驻济南部队和山东省军区以及济南市革命委员会负责人出席了大会。山东省革命委员会第一副主任、济南部队负责人杨得志在会上讲了话。他号召济南市工人阶级更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，在巩固和发展革命的大联合中当模范，立新功。会议向全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众发出了紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，迅速掀起革命大联合新高潮的倡议书。
    新华社济南二十一日电　据《青岛日报》报道：青岛港务局的无产阶级革命派最迅速、最坚决地按照毛主席的最新指示办事，在上海工人阶级革命大联合高潮的推动下，在青岛市革命委员会和驻港中国人民解放军的关怀和帮助下，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在今天实现革命的大联合，成立了全港统一的革命组织——青岛市革命职工总司令部港务局联合司令部，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    青岛港务局无产阶级革命派，在“一月革命”风暴中，联合夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，挑起革命、生产两副重担，革命和生产出现了欣欣向荣的大好景象。后来，由于革命派内部在某些问题的看法上存在分歧，没有及时得到解决，就分裂成为两派，形成了长期“打内战”的局面。
    人民解放军进驻青岛港后，一方面深入群众，做艰苦细致的调查研究工作，一方面组织革命职工，特别是两派的负责人，带着活思想学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作，学习《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》的有关社论。通过活学活用毛主席著作，全港革命派特别是老工人迫切要求实现革命大联合。他们说：两派光打“内战”，革命搞不好，生产上不去，让敌人看笑话，我们很痛心，是革命派就应该很快联合起来。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席的最新指示传来后，极大地鼓舞了青岛港的无产阶级革命派。他们把毛主席的最新指示写成大字报，贴遍了青岛港。许多革命职工还把毛主席的最新指示抄在红彤彤的《毛主席语录》本上，天天学，天天读。驻港人民解放军组织大家尤其是两派的负责人反复认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示。许多革命职工在学习讨论会上说，毛主席最理解我们的心情，毛主席的话，说到了我们的心坎里。我们工人阶级根本利益是一致的，没有半条理由不联合。大家破私立公，检查了自己坚持“以我为核心”实行大联合的错误思想，坚决表示要克服山头主义、小团体主义，加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，以革命利益为重，迅速实现革命的大联合。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，两派组织迅速地实现了革命的大联合。
    今天，全港无产阶级革命派在码头上隆重举行了庆祝全港革命大联合的大会。全港红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，一片欢腾。
