Japanese friends involved in promoting friendly trade between Japan and China held a massive rally and demonstration in Tokyo on August 29, with over 1,500 participants. They strongly opposed Prime Minister Sato's planned visits to Taiwan and South Vietnam, demanding the abolition of the "Yoshida Letter" that harms Sino-Japanese trade, and the immediate and unconditional issuance of entry visas for the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association.

The main stage of the rally was adorned with a portrait of Chairman Mao. The meeting unanimously passed three resolutions: condemning the Sato government, opposing Sato's visits to Taiwan and South Vietnam, demanding the immediate and unconditional issuance of entry visas for the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association, and calling for the immediate abolition of the "Yoshida Letter."

Uchihara Teiji, Executive Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, addressed the rally, calling for a large-scale mass movement to oppose Sato's visit to Taiwan, and to remove all obstacles to further the political, economic, cultural, and academic exchanges between the peoples of Japan and China.

Seven representatives from central and local organizations, including Kawase Kazuo, spoke at the rally. Young representative Sasakura Susumu and West Japan representative Nihonobu Shuichiro also addressed the crowd.

Nihonobu Shuichiro said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. We must be determined to fight for the liberation of the Japanese nation to the end." He shouted, "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" The audience responded with thunderous applause.

After the rally, the participants formed three protest groups and marched to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Justice to hold protests.

On the same morning, about 1,000 people from the Sino-Japanese trade community gathered at Rokugo Bridge, which connects Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture, to warmly welcome over 300 people who had traveled from western Japan, Kansai, Tokai, and Hokuriku regions to participate in the demonstration. They led a procession of 36 large buses, covering a distance of 60 kilometers. The buses were adorned with large banners reading "Resolutely Oppose Sato's Visits to Taiwan and South Vietnam" and "Do Not Allow the Soviet Revisionists and Japanese Revisionists to Sabotage Sino-Japanese Friendship!" The procession was accompanied by four broadcast vehicles playing revolutionary songs from Japan and China, and the demonstrators continuously exposed the Sato government's anti-China policies through loudspeakers.

The demonstrators repeatedly chanted slogans such as "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China!" and "Long live the great Chairman Mao!"

The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade held its 13th Standing Committee meeting on August 31 and issued a statement protesting the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to extend the stay of six members of the Chinese Technical Import Corporation's inspection team in Japan.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese government's unreasonable decision is closely related to Prime Minister Sato's active participation in the U.S. imperialist's expansion of the Vietnam War and his planned visit to Taiwan.

The statement said that the Standing Committee strongly protests the new crime committed by the Sato government against China and will further expose the Sato government's anti-people and anti-China conspiracies to the Japanese people.

The statement emphasized that without a resolute struggle against the Sato government, it would be impossible to maintain and develop friendly trade between Japan and China.

Toyoshima Shokai, the friendly company hosting the inspection team, held a press conference on August 31 and issued a statement pointing out that this incident, along with the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to issue entry visas for the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association and the restriction on the exhibition of scientific instruments from Tianjin, are all manifestations of the Sato government's anti-China policy. The statement condemned a small group of reactionaries, Japanese Communist Party revisionists, and the Sato government for colluding to obstruct and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship and trade.

　　日本朋友举行声势浩大集会游行反对佐藤政府反华
　　坚决维护日中两国人民的战斗友谊
　　日本国际贸易促进会发表声明强烈抗议佐藤政府敌视中国的新罪行
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京从事日中友好贸易事业的日本朋友一千五百多人，八月二十九日举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，强烈反对佐藤即将到台湾和南越活动，要求废除损害日中贸易的“吉田书简”，立即无条件地签发中日友协访日代表团的入境签证。
    大会会场正面挂着毛主席的语录。大会一致通过谴责佐藤政府的宣言和反对佐藤荣作到台湾和南越活动；要求立即无条件签发中日友协访日代表团入境签证；要求立即废除“吉田书简”等三个决议。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事荻原定司在大会上发言，号召掀起一个大规模的反对佐藤到台湾活动的群众运动，排除一切障碍，进一步开展日中两国人民政治、经济、文化、学术方面的交流。
    在大会上发言的还有川濑一贯等七名中央和地方的代表，青年代表佐佐木进和西日本代表仁保修二郎等。
    仁保修二郎说，我们要牢记毛主席的帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的教导，下定决心为日本民族的解放而奋斗到底。他高呼：“祝伟大的毛主席万寿无疆！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”这时候，会场上响起了经久不息的掌声。
    大会结束后，参加会议的人组成三个抗议团，分路前往外务省、通产省、法务省举行抗议示威。
    同一天的清晨，约一千名日中贸易界人士齐集于东京都和神奈川县交界的六乡大桥，热烈欢迎三百多名从西日本、关西、东海、北陆各地乘车前来参加示威游行的队伍。他们以四辆广播宣传车为先导，乘坐三十六辆大轿车，浩浩荡荡地进行了六十公里的示威游行。大轿车上挂着巨幅的坚决反对佐藤到台湾和南越活动和“不许苏修、日修集团破坏日中友好！”等大字标语。广播车上不断播送《大海航行靠舵手》等日本和中国的革命歌曲，示威者还不断通过广播演说揭露佐藤政府的反华政策。
    游行的人们不断振臂高呼“日中两国人民战斗友谊万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东主席万岁！”等口号。
    新华社东京二日电日本国际贸易促进会第十三次常任理事会八月三十一日发表声明，抗议佐藤政府无理拒绝中国技术进口总公司实习检验工作组六人延长在日停留期限的粗暴行为。
    声明指出，日本政府这一无理决定，是同日本首相佐藤积极参加美帝扩大侵越战争和佐藤将去台湾活动的罪恶行动分不开的。
    声明说，常任理事会强烈抗议佐藤政府所犯下的敌视中国的新罪行，同时，要进一步向日本人民揭露佐藤政府所进行的反人民的反华阴谋。
    声明表示，这一事件再次证明，不同佐藤政府进行坚决的斗争，就不能维护和发展日中友好贸易。
    接待我实习检验工作组的友好商社丰岛商会三十一日举行记者招待会发表声明指出，这一事件和佐藤政府无理拒绝签发中日友协代表团入境签证和限制中国天津科学仪器展览展品等事件，都是佐藤政府推行反华政策的表现。声明谴责一小撮反动分子、日共修正主义分子和佐藤政府勾结在一起，企图阻挠和破坏日中友好和日中贸易。
