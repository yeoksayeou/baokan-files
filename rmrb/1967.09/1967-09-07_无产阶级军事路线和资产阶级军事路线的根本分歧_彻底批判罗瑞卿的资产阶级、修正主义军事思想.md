The proletariat must seize power, consolidate power, and achieve a thorough victory in the revolutionary struggle. "We not only need a correct Marxist political line, but also a correct Marxist military line." Without a correct political line to guide us, it is impossible to have a correct military line; without a correct military line, it is also impossible to implement and realize a correct political line. However, "the correct political and military lines are not produced and developed peacefully and naturally. They are produced and developed through struggle. On the one hand, they must struggle against 'Left' opportunism, and on the other hand, they must struggle against 'Right' opportunism. Without struggling against these harmful tendencies that harm the revolution and revolutionary war, and thoroughly overcoming them, the construction of the correct line and the victory of the revolutionary war are impossible."

Over the past few decades, in the various historical stages of the Chinese revolution, there have always been two fundamentally opposed military lines within our party and military, engaging in sharp and intense struggles. One is the proletarian military line represented by Chairman Mao, and the other is the bourgeois military line promoted by 'Left' and 'Right' opportunists. Chairman Mao's proletarian military line has been developed and perfected through struggles against the bourgeois military line.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has brilliantly created the most complete, most scientific, and greatest proletarian military theory. Chairman Mao personally drafted the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and in other series of military works, formulated the most correct proletarian military line. This is the highest peak of Marxist-Leninist military thought. This is the most powerful and sharpest weapon for the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The great victories of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and the magnificent achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that shocked the world are the great victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, and the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, has always been the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought. Over the past forty years, at every major historical juncture, Vice Chairman Lin Biao has always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and engaging in irreconcilable struggles against erroneous lines within the party and the military, making outstanding contributions.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Ro Ruisong have always opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and crazily promoted the bourgeois military line. After the Party's Lushan Conference exposed Peng Dehuai, Ro Ruisong became the vanguard of promoting the reactionary bourgeois military line. He and Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun formed an anti-party conspiracy group, under the protection and support of the Chinese Khrushchev, desperately fighting for the bourgeois command to seize military power. They coordinated military and civilian efforts, and once the time was ripe, they would launch a counter-revolutionary coup, overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship.

Throughout the socialist period, the struggle between the two military lines is essentially a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for control of the military. This is an important part of the struggle between the proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie's attempt to restore capitalism.

The focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's military line and the bourgeois military line in the construction of our army is whether to emphasize proletarian politics.

Over the past forty years, the struggle between Chairman Mao's military line and the bourgeois military line has always centered on whether to prioritize politics over military affairs, whether to emphasize politics or military affairs.

The core of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line is that the construction of the people's army must emphasize proletarian politics and must first and foremost build the army politically.

As early as the founding of our army, Chairman Mao pointed out in the resolutions of the Gutian Conference, which he personally drafted and which have great historical significance, "Military affairs are only one of the tools for completing political tasks." "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks." This correctly expounds the relationship between military affairs and politics, which is that military affairs must be subordinate to politics, and politics must command military affairs.

Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party, such as Peng Dehuai and Ro Ruisong, have always opposed Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics and advocating military first, technology first.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was a fundamental struggle over how to correctly handle the issue of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and the united front. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao advocated "independence within the united front, both unity and independence." It insisted on the principle of the Communist Party's absolute leadership over the Eighth Route Army. The capitulationist line represented by Wang Ming and the Chinese Khrushchev advocated handing over the leadership of the anti-Japanese united front to the Kuomintang. The Chinese Khrushchev even fawned on Chiang Kai-shek as the "banner of revolution," wanting to hand over the Communist Party-led army to the "National Government" to lead. Ro Ruisong, in line with the needs of the capitulationist line, published the book "Political Work in the Anti-Japanese Army." In this book, he did not mention class struggle at all, did not mention the proletariat seizing power, but instead vigorously propagated the reactionary politics of the Kuomintang, shamelessly using Chiang Kai-shek's biography, "wisdom, benevolence, courage," "loyalty, filial piety, love" as the basis for army political work, even requiring political commissars to "ensure that the troops absolutely obey" Chiang Kai-shek's command, handing over the proletarian gun to Chiang Kai-shek. Ro Ruisong also propagated war terror, spreading defeatism, saying that "casualties in war are the greatest threat to the human spirit!" Attempting to undermine the morale of our army, making the Chinese people lay down their weapons and be slaughtered by the Japanese invaders. Ro Ruisong's line is a thorough capitulationism, completely serving the capitulationist line of Wang Ming and the Chinese Khrushchev.

During the War of Liberation, Ro Ruisong, in his report "How to Strengthen Political Work in the Army," listed political, military, and logistical work on an equal footing, opposing the placement of political work in the first position. He said: "It is wrong to especially emphasize and overly stress political work." In fact, his so-called not overly stressing political work is to abolish proletarian politics and replace it with bourgeois politics.

Our Vice Chairman Lin Biao has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always been the most loyal and resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's military line, emphasizing the political construction of the army. Especially after he took charge of the Military Commission, based on Chairman Mao's military thought and the historical experience of our army, he summarized the experience of the struggle between the two military lines since the founding of the country, personally presided over the formulation of the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army," creatively proposed the idea of the "Four Firsts," proposed to vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, insist on the "Four Firsts," promote the "Three-Eight Style," develop the "Three Democracies," launch the "Four Good" movement, and other series of policies, principles, and major measures, bringing the construction of our army into a new stage.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The "Four Firsts" are good, this is a creation. The ideological and political work and military work of the Liberation Army, after Vice Chairman Lin Biao proposed the "Four Firsts" and the "Three-Eight Style," have developed greatly compared to the past, becoming more concrete and theoretical.

Emphasizing politics is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the broad cadres and soldiers, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army, the foundation of our army's construction, and the fundamental guarantee that our army will never change its nature. Ro Ruisong, out of his personal ambition and class instinct, fears and hates Mao Zedong Thought to death. He has always opposed Vice Chairman Lin Biao, who vigorously advocates the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, and has used every means to obstruct the broad cadres and soldiers from actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, he treats the Chinese Khrushchev's "Cultivation" as a sacred text, personally ordering the entire army to study it as a compulsory course, and emphasizing "serious, repeated study," "active learning and application," "self-examination." His purpose is to use the revisionist "Cultivation" to corrupt the soul of our army, making us lose our direction, deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, making us forget class and class struggle, forget proletarian dictatorship, and attempting to fundamentally change the proletarian nature of our army.

Ro Ruisong also used large-scale competitions to undermine politics and the study of Chairman Mao's works. Large-scale competitions emphasize military affairs, emphasize technology, engage in formalism, championshipism, and individualism, and in reality, emphasize bourgeois politics. Large-scale competitions are a great exposure of Ro Ruisong's bourgeois military thought and a great exposure of his conspiracy to seize the military and oppose the party.

Vice Chairman Lin corrected the errors of the large-scale competitions in time and once again issued instructions to emphasize politics. Ro Ruisong still stubbornly resisted, saying: "Military training is politics, is the greatest politics," "military affairs are thoroughly politics." This view of equating politics and military affairs, using military affairs to replace politics, is a thorough bourgeois military view. Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, is the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all work. Ro Ruisong spreads his revisionist fallacies, wanting politics to be subordinate to military affairs, military affairs to lead politics, removing the soul of our army, turning our proletarian army into a bourgeois army.

In a society where classes and class struggle exist, no field will be a vacuum, not guided by proletarian thought, and will be guided by bourgeois thought. The army is a tool of class struggle, either serving proletarian politics or bourgeois politics, and there has never been and will never be an army that is detached from politics.

All Khrushchev-like figures who want to seize proletarian power and restore capitalism, an important means is to first corrupt the army ideologically, seize military power, and grab the gun. Therefore, whether to emphasize proletarian politics, whether to carry out the ideological revolution of the people, is a major issue related to whether the proletarian army will change its nature, a major issue related to whether the gun is in the hands of the proletariat or the bourgeoisie. Ultimately, it is a major issue related to whether the proletariat can consolidate power after seizing it. Ro Ruisong desperately opposes emphasizing proletarian politics, opposes Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, attempting to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our army, turning our army into a bourgeois army, as a tool for them to seize proletarian power and restore capitalism.

Whether or not to carry out the people's war is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's military thought and bourgeois military thought.

Chairman Mao's great theory on the people's war has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. It not only opened up the only correct path for the Chinese people to achieve national victory but also pointed out the broad and smooth road to complete liberation for all oppressed nations and classes in the world.

All oppressed nations and classes must complete their liberation cause, the most important thing is to arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory on the people's war, use the gun to smash the old state machine, use the gun to overthrow imperialism and its running dogs, use the gun to transform the whole world.

Whether or not to carry out the people's war, whether or not to dare to carry out the people's war, is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's military thought and bourgeois military thought, and is also the touchstone for distinguishing Marxism-Leninism from revisionism, true revolution from false revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." "Around the revolutionary government, we must unite tens of millions of people to develop our revolutionary war, and we will be able to annihilate all counter-revolutionaries."

Chairman Mao's people's war thought is based on the idea of fully trusting and relying on the masses, mobilizing, organizing, and arming the broad masses of the people, using the people's war to annihilate counter-revolutionary war, seize national power; after seizing power, always be prepared to use the people's war to oppose imperialism and its running dogs launching wars of aggression, defending the proletarian dictatorship.

Like all opportunists, Ro Ruisong's military thought is based on weaponry. He does not believe in the masses, does not rely on the masses, opposes arming the masses, opposes the militia system, and opposes Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of the people's war.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates that technology is in the leading position and determines everything. Ro Ruisong advocates that with new technological equipment, we can "annihilate any invading enemy army in the ocean, in the sky, and at the enemy's base of attack." They use the theory of victory through weapons to oppose arming the masses of the people, oppose using the people's war to deal with imperialist aggression, and foolishly believe that they can rely solely on technological equipment to defeat the enemy. This is a typical bourgeois military thought. In modern conditions, is it not necessary to rely on the masses of the people, not to carry out the people's war? No, not at all. "The comparison of strength is not only the comparison of military and economic strength, but also the comparison of manpower and morale. Military and economic strength must be grasped by people." No matter how modern weapons and equipment develop, no matter how complex modern warfare is, to win the victory of the war, it still depends on the support and struggle of the masses of the people, it still depends on the people's struggle, ultimately, it still depends on the people's war, which is the most important and reliable guarantee for defeating the enemy.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has most fully and deeply expounded the importance of arming the people. After national victory, Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "Imperialism bullies us like this, this needs to be seriously dealt with. We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish militia regiments. In this way, when imperialism invades our country, they will find it difficult to move an inch." "If imperialism dares to launch an aggressive war against our country, then we will realize the mobilization of the entire people, the militia will cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and continuously supplement the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly defeating the invaders."

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: Militia work is a fundamental issue in our national defense construction, an important component of strategic issues, and a specific application of the party's mass line in war. Combining the construction of a modernized revolutionary army with the establishment of militia regiments is the application of the "two-legged" policy in national defense construction, a major development of Chairman Mao's people's war thought under modern conditions.

The militia has always been an important component of our armed forces and a solid foundation for carrying out the people's war. Without the militia, our main force army would be like a tree without roots, like a one-armed general, and it would be impossible to fight a true people's war.

The militia is also a tool of our proletarian dictatorship. Whether or not to have a militia is actually a major issue of whether to weaken or strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Ro Ruisong regard the militia organized according to Mao Zedong Thought as a major obstacle to their seizure of the party and the army, realizing the restoration of capitalism. On the one hand, they use every means to sabotage the construction of the militia, opposing the arming of the people; on the other hand, they promote a purely military viewpoint in the construction of the militia, opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics, attempting to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our militia, turning the militia into a tool for them to realize their personal ambitions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army is powerful because it divides itself into main force units and local units. The former can execute supra-regional combat missions at any time, while the latter's task is fixed in coordinating with the militia and self-defense corps to defend the locality and attack local enemies." "If there is no such correct division, ... only paying attention to the role of the main force units and neglecting the role of the local units, ... it is impossible to defeat the enemy." After national victory, Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed to strengthen the construction of local armed forces. In addition to strengthening their own construction, local armed forces should coordinate with local areas to strengthen mass work, build a good militia, and supplement and expand it in wartime to fight against the enemy.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplice Ro Ruisong, while opposing the militia system, strongly opposed the construction of local armed forces. The Chinese Khrushchev said, "Should we do a little? Half-detached from production, return home during busy farming seasons." This is a fallacy of not wanting local armed forces. Ro Ruisong, according to his master's instructions, first blocked and refused to execute Chairman Mao's instructions on strengthening the construction of local armed forces for a full five years; later, he pretended to comply but acted against the instructions, using every means to sabotage the construction of local armed forces.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Our army not only has its own main force army but also its own local army, and vigorously establishes and develops militia organizations, implementing a combined armed forces system of main force army, local army, and militia." Implementing the combined armed forces system can mobilize the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people, forming a combat entity, fully displaying the power of the people's war. When imperialism invades our country, the militia is not only a continuous reserve force for our army but can also lead the broad masses of the people to widely carry out guerrilla warfare, with everyone as a soldier, every household as a fortress, every village as a battlefield, laying a net of heaven and earth for the enemy. Local armed forces are the backbone of regional anti-enemy struggles, leading the broad militia to effectively cooperate with the main force army in combat, and continuously expanding and upgrading, strengthening the main force army. With the cooperation of local armed forces and the broad militia, the main force army can free its hands, forming a powerful "fist," seeking and creating favorable opportunities, and mobilizing and concentrating to fight annihilation battles at any time.

The Chinese Khrushchev and Ro Ruisong want to cut off the militia and cut off the local armed forces, destroying our traditional system of combining the main force army, local army, and militia, destroying the foundation of carrying out the people's war. They oppose arming the people, oppose using the people's war to deal with imperialist wars of aggression, and bet the fate of the country on technological equipment, fundamentally negating the people's war thought. If we believe in Ro Ruisong's line, we will bury the hard-won victory fruits and bury the entire proletarian revolutionary cause.

Whether to adopt an active defense or a passive defense is the two fundamentally opposed strategic guidelines of Chairman Mao's military line and the bourgeois military line.

Active defense is Chairman Mao's consistent strategic thought, the fundamental guiding thought for our victory in every revolutionary war and for dealing with imperialist aggression, and is also the only correct guiding thought for the victory of revolutionary wars by the people of all countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Active defense, also called offensive defense, also called decisive defense. Passive defense, also called pure defense, also called single defense. Passive defense is actually false defense, only active defense is true defense, is defense for counterattack and offense." In strategic guidance, whether to adopt the strategic guideline of active defense or the strategic guideline of passive defense is a fundamental issue related to the victory or defeat of the revolutionary war.

Active defense is based on the thought of thorough proletarian revolution and thorough annihilation of the enemy, and its core is to fight annihilation battles. Only by fighting annihilation battles can we continuously consume and weaken the enemy, develop and strengthen our own forces, and ultimately defeat the enemy. Annihilation battles are our basic guiding thought for combat. Whether we mainly rely on guerrilla warfare or mainly rely on mobile warfare; whether in strategic guidance or in combat actions, we should implement this guiding thought.

The history of the Chinese people's revolutionary war proves that as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's correct strategic guideline of active defense, we will definitely win battles and make the revolutionary cause develop smoothly; otherwise, we will definitely lose battles and make the revolutionary cause suffer setbacks.

Our Vice Chairman Lin Biao has always been the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in defending and implementing Chairman Mao's correct guideline of active defense, opposing the erroneous guideline of passive defense. Vice Chairman Lin Biao has repeatedly instructed us to seriously study Chairman Mao's great strategic thought and resolutely ensure the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's strategic guideline of active defense.

Ro Ruisong has always opposed Chairman Mao's strategic thought, opposed the strategic guideline of active defense, and advocated passive defense, single defense, and fighting to the bitter end. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Ro Ruisong followed Peng Dehuai in opposing Chairman Mao's correct guideline of boldly mobilizing the masses in the enemy's rear, carrying out independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, establishing anti-Japanese base areas, and developing and strengthening the people's anti-Japanese armed forces. They arbitrarily launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive, concentrating the main force of the Eighth Route Army to fight a war of attrition with the Japanese devils, causing serious setbacks to the anti-Japanese base areas in North China and the development of our army. In reality, they were propping up the Kuomintang. After Ro Ruisong seized an important position in our army, in line with the needs of the Chinese Khrushchev's class capitulationism and national capitulationism, he vigorously advocated the erroneous guideline of passive defense. The Chinese Khrushchev said: "We must hold back the enemy," "it will be difficult if the enemy comes in." Ro Ruisong also said: "The conditions are different now," and we can only adopt the "method of blocking water." Their fallacies are not new tricks but are the rotten goods of passive defense that Chairman Mao criticized in the 1930s.

They advocate "holding back" and "blocking water," fearing to lose territory, fearing to "break the pots and pans," fearing to offend American imperialism. This is a common psychological characteristic of the heirs of Khrushchev revisionism who surrender to imperialism and fear war. The Chinese people are a great people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, daring to lure the enemy deep into our territory, daring to adopt the strategic guideline of active defense. To annihilate a large number of enemies, we will actively and planfully temporarily give up some territory, lure the enemy in, force the enemy to disperse their forces, force the enemy to carry their burdens, force the enemy to make mistakes; let the enemy be happy, let the enemy stretch out all ten fingers, let the enemy's two feet sink into the mud. In this way, we can concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one. Only by annihilating the enemy's combat effectiveness can we ultimately hold the territory. Ro Ruisong fears to lose territory, fears to break the pots and pans, clings to passive defense as a treasure, wanting to set up defenses everywhere, divide forces to guard the mouth, stretch out five fingers, and take a stance to fight a war of attrition with the enemy. If we follow this strategic guideline that brings disaster to the country, we will be weak everywhere, passively take blows, let the enemy pick us off one by one, turning adventurism into capitulationism, and betraying our proletarian state.

They shout "the conditions are different now." What conditions are different? It is just that imperialism has atomic bombs and nuclear weapons. What's so great about that! Marxists have always believed that no matter how technology and equipment change, the basic laws of revolutionary war will not change. "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor, the decisive factor is people, not things." The final victory or defeat of the war still depends on the continuous combat of ground troops, the political awareness of the people, the bravery and spirit of sacrifice of the people, the rifles, grenades, bayonet charges, night battles, and close combat within a few dozen meters. In opposing imperialist wars of aggression, no matter what weapons the enemy uses, as long as they dare to enter our territory, we will have the greatest initiative, fully exploiting our strengths and advantages, using various methods to strike the enemy, displaying the magic of the people's war, making them come and not return.

They say "it will be difficult if the enemy comes in." This is a public spread of defeatism and capitulationism. Their fallacies, in essence, are fear of war, fear of imperialism, fear of revolution, fear of losing their heads. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In front of the beast, we must not show the slightest cowardice." Imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries are all paper tigers, appearing fierce but actually the weakest. If they dare to launch an aggressive war against us, bringing "goods" to our doorstep, then let them come! The more enemies come, the more are annihilated, the greater our contribution to the world revolution, this is a great thing that we can't ask for!

The Chinese Khrushchev and Ro Ruisong crazily oppose Chairman Mao's strategic guideline of active defense, vigorously promoting the strategic guideline of passive defense, completely in line with the political needs of imperialism and modern revisionism, completely betraying the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world, completely betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause.

On the eve of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Ruisong opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed Chairman Mao's military line, and his conspiracy to seize the military and oppose the party has been thoroughly exposed. The reactionary bourgeois military line he promoted, along with himself, has been unanimously condemned by the broad cadres and soldiers of the entire army. In the high tide of criticizing the revisionist line led by the Chinese Khrushchev, we must thoroughly criticize and expose the bourgeois military line, and thoroughly eliminate their poison, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line, forever emphasize proletarian politics, further promote the ideological and organizational revolution of the entire army, forever keep the gun in the hands of the proletariat, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and make our proletarian iron state last forever, never changing color!

　　无产阶级军事路线和资产阶级军事路线的根本分歧
　　——彻底批判罗瑞卿的资产阶级、修正主义军事思想
　　中国人民解放军总参谋部机关无产阶级革命派
    无产阶级要夺取政权，巩固政权，取得革命斗争的彻底胜利，“不但需要一个马克思主义的正确的政治路线，而且需要一个马克思主义的正确的军事路线。”没有正确的政治路线作指导，就不可能有正确的军事路线；没有正确的军事路线，也就不可能贯彻、实现正确的政治路线。但是，“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。一方面，它要同‘左’倾机会主义作斗争，另一方面，它又要同右倾机会主义作斗争。不同这些危害革命和革命战争的有害的倾向作斗争，并且彻底地克服它们，正确路线的建设和革命战争的胜利，是不可能的。”
    几十年来，在中国革命发展的各个历史阶段，在我们党内军内一直存在着两条根本对立的军事路线，进行着尖锐激烈的斗争。一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级军事路线，另一条是“左”、右倾机会主义者所推行的资产阶级军事路线。毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，就是在同资产阶级军事路线的斗争中不断发展和完善起来的。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，天才地创立了最完整、最科学、最伟大的无产阶级军事理论。毛主席亲自起草的古田会议决议和在其他一系列的军事著作中，制定了一条最正确的无产阶级军事路线。这是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰。这是全世界无产阶级和革命人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大、最锐利的武器。
    中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，中国人民解放军所取得的震惊世界的丰功伟绩，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级军事路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席最亲密的战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志，一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想。四十年来，在每个重大历史关头，林彪同志总是旗帜鲜明地、最坚定地站在毛主席的正确路线一边，捍卫毛泽东思想，同党内军内的错误路线进行不调和的斗争，作出了卓越的贡献。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线。党的庐山会议揪出彭德怀以后，罗瑞卿就成了推行反动资产阶级军事路线的急先锋。他和彭真、陆定一、杨尚昆结成反党阴谋集团，在中国赫鲁晓夫的包庇和支持下，拚死命地为资产阶级司令部篡夺军权。他们文武相配合，一旦时机成熟，就要发动反革命政变，颠覆无产阶级专政。
    在整个社会主义时期，两条军事路线的斗争，实质上就是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺兵权的斗争。这是无产阶级专政条件下资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    突出不突出无产阶级政治，是毛主席的军事路线和资产阶级军事路线在我军建设上斗争的焦点
    四十年来，毛主席的建军路线同资产阶级建军路线的斗争，一直是集中在政治第一还是军事第一，突出政治还是突出军事这个根本问题上。
    毛主席的建军思想和建军路线的核心，就是人民军队的建设要突出无产阶级政治，要首先和着重地从政治上建军。
    早在我军创建初期，毛主席就在他亲自起草的具有伟大历史意义的古田会议决议中指出，“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一。”“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”正确地阐明了军事和政治的关系。这就是军事必须服从政治，政治统帅军事。
    彭德怀、罗瑞卿这样的混入党内的资产阶级代表人物，总是同毛主席的建军思想和建军路线相对抗，反对突出无产阶级政治，提倡军事第一，技术第一。
    抗日战争期间，在如何正确对待国共合作和统一战线的问题上，形成了两条根本对立的路线。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，主张“统一战线中的独立自主，既统一，又独立。”坚持“共产党绝对领导八路军的原则。”以王明和中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的投降主义路线，主张把抗日统一战线的领导权交给国民党。中国赫鲁晓夫还奴颜婢膝地吹捧蒋介石是“革命的旗帜”，要把共产党领导的军队交给“国民政府”去领导。罗瑞卿适应投降主义路线的需要，抛出了《抗日军队中的政治工作》一书。在这本书中，他根本不讲阶级斗争，根本不讲无产阶级夺取政权，而是竭力宣扬国民党的反动政治，恬不知耻地把蒋介石的生平，“智、仁、勇”，“忠孝、仁爱”作为军队政治工作的基础，甚至要政治委员“保证部队绝对听从”蒋介石的指挥，把无产阶级的枪杆子交给蒋介石。罗瑞卿还宣传战争恐怖，散布亡国论，说什么“战争中的死伤，这是对于人的精神上的最大的威胁”！妄图瓦解我军士气，要中国人民放下武器，在日本侵略者面前听任宰割。罗瑞卿的这一套，是彻头彻尾的投降主义政治，完全是为王明和中国赫鲁晓夫投降主义路线服务的。
    解放战争时期，罗瑞卿在《如何加强军队政治工作》的报告中，把政治、军事、后勤等项工作平列起来，反对把政治工作放在第一位。他说：“喜欢特别突出的过分强调”政治工作，“是错误的。”实际上，他的所谓不要过分强调政治工作就是要取消无产阶级政治，而代之以资产阶级政治。
    我们的副统帅林彪同志，一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一贯最忠实、最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线，强调从政治上建军。特别是他主持军委工作以后，根据毛主席的建军思想，我军的历史经验，总结了建国以来两条军事路线斗争的经验，亲自主持制定了《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，创造性地提出了四个第一的思想，提出了大力突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好运动等一系列方针、原则和重大措施，使我军的建设进入了一个崭新的阶段。
    毛主席指出：四个第一好，这是个创造。解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。
    突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大指战员的头脑，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。伟大的毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我军建设的根本，是我军永不变质的根本保证。罗瑞卿出于他的个人野心和反动阶级本能，对毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命，一贯反对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志，一贯反对林彪同志在全军、全党和全国积极倡导活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，千方百计地阻挠广大指战员活学活用毛主席著作。与此同时，他把中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》奉若神明，亲自下令全军当作必修课，并强调“认真地、反复地学”，“活学活用”，“对照检查”。他的目的就是用修正主义的《修养》腐蚀我军的灵魂，使我们迷失方向，离开毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，要我们忘掉阶级和阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，妄图从根本上改变我军的无产阶级性质。
    罗瑞卿还用大比武冲击政治，冲击毛主席著作学习。大比武是突出军事，突出技术，搞形式主义、锦标主义、个人主义，实际上就是突出资产阶级政治。大比武是罗瑞卿的资产阶级建军思想的大暴露，是他篡军反党阴谋的大暴露。
    林副主席及时纠正了大比武的错误，再次作了突出政治的指示。罗瑞卿仍然负隅顽抗，胡说什么：“军事训练就是政治，就是最大的政治”，“军事就是彻头彻尾的政治”。这种把政治和军事等同起来，用军事代替政治的说法，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的军事观点。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是一切工作的生命线。罗瑞卿散布他那一套修正主义谬论，就是要政治服从军事，军事领导政治，抽去我军的灵魂，把我们无产阶级军队变成资产阶级军队。
    在存在阶级和阶级斗争的社会中，社会的各个领域都不会是真空的，不受无产阶级思想指导，就要受资产阶级思想指导。军队是阶级斗争的工具，不是为无产阶级政治服务，就是为资产阶级政治服务，从来没有也不可能有脱离政治的军队。
    一切赫鲁晓夫式的人物要篡夺无产阶级政权，实行资本主义复辟，很重要的一手就是首先从思想上腐蚀军队，篡夺军权，抓枪杆子。因此，突出不突出无产阶级政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，是关系到无产阶级军队会不会变质的大问题，关系到枪杆子掌握在无产阶级还是资产阶级手里的大问题。归根结底，就是关系到无产阶级夺取政权之后，能不能巩固政权的大问题。罗瑞卿拚命地反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，就是妄图用资产阶级世界观来改造我们的军队，把我军演变为资产阶级军队，作为他们篡夺无产阶级政权、复辟资本主义的工具。
    要不要实行人民战争，是毛主席的军事思想和资产阶级军事思想的分水岭
    毛主席关于人民战争的伟大理论，天才地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。它不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国胜利的唯一正确的道路，而且为全世界被压迫民族和被压迫阶级指出了争取彻底解放的康庄大道。
    一切被压迫民族和被压迫阶级要完成自己的解放事业，最重要的，就是用毛主席关于人民战争的理论武装起来，用枪杆子打碎旧的国家机器，用枪杆子打倒帝国主义及其走狗，用枪杆子改造整个世界。
    要不要实行人民战争，敢不敢实行人民战争，是毛主席的军事思想和资产阶级军事思想的分水岭，也是马克思列宁主义和修正主义、真革命和假革命的试金石。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命”。
    毛主席的人民战争思想，是建立在充分相信群众，依靠群众的思想基础上的，就是把广大人民群众动员起来，组织起来，武装起来，用人民战争消灭反革命战争，夺取全国政权；在夺取政权以后，时刻准备用人民战争反对帝国主义及其走狗发动侵略战争，保卫无产阶级政权。
    同一切机会主义者一样，罗瑞卿的军事思想是建立在唯武器论的基础上的。他根本不相信群众，不依靠群众，反对武装群众，反对民兵制度，反对毛主席的人民战争的伟大战略思想。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬什么技术占首要地位，技术决定一切。罗瑞卿则鼓吹有了新的技术装备，就可以“把任何侵犯的敌军消灭在海洋、在天空、在敌人发起进攻的基地上。”他们用武器制胜论来反对武装人民群众，反对用人民战争来对付帝国主义的侵略，妄想单纯依靠技术装备来战胜敌人。这是典型的资产阶级军事思想。在现代条件下作战，是不是不要依靠人民群众，不要人民战争了呢？不是，完全不是。“力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”不管现代武器和技术装备怎样发展，不管现代战争的打法怎么复杂，要赢得战争的胜利，还是决定于人民群众的拥护和支持，决定于人民群众的斗争，归根到底，还是靠人民战争，这是战胜敌人的最重要最可靠的保证。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最充分、最深刻地阐明了武装群众的重要性。全国胜利以后，毛主席一再教导我们：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”“帝国主义如果竟敢发动对我国的侵略战争，那时我们就将实现全民皆兵，民兵就将配合人民解放军，并且随时补充人民解放军，彻底打败侵略者。”
    林副主席指出：民兵工作是我国国防建设的一个根本性问题，是战略问题的一个重要组成部分，是党的群众路线在战争上的具体运用。把建设现代化革命军队和大办民兵师结合起来，这是“两条腿走路”的方针在国防建设上的具体运用，是毛主席人民战争思想在现代条件下的重大发展。
    民兵历来是我们武装力量的一个重要组成部分，是实行人民战争的坚实基础。如果没有民兵，我们的主力军就会是无源之水，无本之木，就象一个独臂将军，就不可能打真正的人民战争。
    民兵又是我们无产阶级专政的工具。要不要民兵，实际上也是削弱还是加强无产阶级专政的大问题。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人罗瑞卿，把按照毛泽东思想组织起来的民兵，看成是他们篡党、篡军，实现资本主义复辟的一大障碍。他们一方面千方百计地破坏民兵建设，反对武装人民群众；一方面又在民兵建设中搞单纯军事观点，反对突出无产阶级政治，妄图用资产阶级世界观来改造我们的民兵，把民兵也变成他们实现个人野心的工具。
    毛主席教导我们：“这个军队之所以有力量，还由于它将自己划分为主力兵团和地方兵团两部分，前者可以随时执行超地方的作战任务，后者的任务则固定在协同民兵、自卫军保卫地方和进攻当地敌人方面。”“如果没有这种正确的划分，……只注意主力兵团的作用，忽视地方兵团的作用，……要战胜敌人也是不可能的。”全国胜利以后，毛主席又一再指示，要大力加强地方武装建设。地方武装除加强本身的建设外，平时协同地方加强群众工作，把民兵搞好，战时用民兵补充扩大，对敌作战。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的帮凶罗瑞卿，在反对民兵制度的同时，极力反对建设地方武装。中国赫鲁晓夫说，地方武装“是否搞一点？半脱离生产，农忙时回家。”这完全是不要地方武装的谬论。罗瑞卿根据他主子的意旨，对毛主席关于加强地方武装建设的指示，先是极力封锁，拒不执行，整整拖了五年之久；后是阳奉阴违，两面三刀，一再大打折扣，千方百计地破坏地方武装的建设。
    林副主席指出：“我们的军队不仅有自己的主力军，还有自己的地方军，并且大力建立和发展民兵组织，实行主力军、地方军和民兵三结合的武装力量体制。”实行三结合的武装力量体制，就能够调动起亿万人民群众的积极性，组成一个战斗整体，最充分地发挥人民战争的威力。当帝国主义侵略我国的时候，民兵不仅是我军的源源不断的后备力量，而且可以带领广大人民群众，广泛地开展游击战，人人是战士，户户是堡垒，村村是战场，给敌人布下天罗地网。地方武装就是坚持地区对敌斗争的骨干，带领广大民兵有力地配合主力军作战，并不断扩编、升级，壮大主力军。主力军有了地方武装和广大民兵的配合作战，就可以腾出手来，形成强有力的“拳头”，寻找和创造有利战机，随时机动和集中打歼灭战。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿，要把民兵砍掉，又要把地方武装砍掉，破坏我们的主力军、地方军和民兵三结合的传统体制，破坏实行人民战争的基础。他们反对武装人民群众，反对用人民战争对付帝国主义的侵略战争，把国家的命运压在技术装备的赌注上，从根本上否定人民战争思想。如果我们相信罗瑞卿的那一套，就要葬送我们艰苦奋斗得来的胜利成果，葬送整个无产阶级革命事业。
    积极防御还是消极防御，是毛主席的军事路线和资产阶级军事路线在战略指导上两种根本对立的方针
    积极防御是毛主席一贯的战略思想，是我们取得历次革命战争胜利和对付帝国主义侵略的根本指导思想，也是各国人民赢得革命战争胜利的唯一正确的指导思想。
    毛主席教导我们说：“积极防御，又叫攻势防御，又叫决战防御。消极防御，又叫专守防御，又叫单纯防御。消极防御实际上是假防御，只有积极防御才是真防御，才是为了反攻和进攻的防御。”在战略指导上，采取积极防御的战略方针，还是消极防御的战略方针，这是关系到革命战争胜败的一个根本问题。
    积极防御是建立在无产阶级彻底革命、彻底消灭敌人的思想基础上的，它的核心就是打歼灭战。只有打歼灭战，才能不断消耗和削弱敌人，发展和壮大自己的力量，最后战胜敌人。歼灭战，是我们作战的基本指导思想。不论以游击战为主，还是以运动战为主；不论在战略指导上，还是在战斗行动上，都应当贯彻这个指导思想。
    中国人民革命战争的历史证明，只要坚决贯彻执行我们伟大统帅毛主席的积极防御的战略方针，就一定能够打胜仗，使革命事业顺利发展，反之，就一定打败仗，使革命事业遭受挫折。
    我们的副统帅林彪同志一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地捍卫和执行毛主席积极防御的正确方针，反对消极防御的错误方针。林彪同志一再指示我们，要认真学习毛主席的伟大战略思想，坚决保证毛主席的积极防御战略方针的彻底实现。
    罗瑞卿一贯反对毛主席的战略思想，反对积极防御的战略方针，主张消极防御、单纯防御，打烂仗。早在抗日战争时期，罗瑞卿就追随彭德怀反对毛主席关于在敌后放手发动群众，开展独立自主的游击战，创建抗日根据地，发展壮大人民抗日武装力量的正确方针。他们擅自发动百团大战，集中八路军的主力同日本鬼子拚消耗，使华北抗日根据地和我军的发展遭受严重挫折。实际上是撑国民党的腰，帮国民党的忙。罗瑞卿在窃取我军的重要职位以后，适应中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义路线的需要，竭力主张推行消极防御的错误方针。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“要把敌人顶住”，“敌人进来就不好办了。”罗瑞卿也跟着说：“现在条件不同了”，只能采取“堵水的办法”。他们的这些谬论，并不是什么新玩艺，而是毛主席早在三十年代就批判了的“御敌于国门之外”的消极防御的破烂货。
    他们主张“顶住”和“堵水”，就是害怕丢掉地方，害怕“打烂坛坛罐罐”，害怕触怒美帝国主义。这是赫鲁晓夫修正主义继承者们屈服于帝国主义、害怕战争的共同的心理特征。中国人民是用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的人民，敢于诱敌深入，敢于采取积极防御的战略方针。为了大量消灭敌人，主动地有计划地暂时放弃一些地方，把敌人放进来，逼着敌人分散兵力，逼着敌人背起包袱，逼着敌人犯错误；让敌人兴高采烈，让敌人十个指头都伸开，让敌人的两只脚都陷在泥坑里。这样，我们就可以集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人，一口一口地把敌人吃掉。只有歼灭了敌人的有生力量，才能最后保住地方。罗瑞卿害怕丢掉地方，害怕打烂坛坛罐罐，死捧着消极防御当法宝，要处处设防，分兵把口，伸开五指，摆开架势，去同敌人拚消耗。照这种祸国殃民的战略方针去做，必然处处薄弱，被动挨打，让敌人各个击破，由冒险主义变成投降主义，断送我们的无产阶级江山。
    他们叫嚷“条件不同了”。什么条件不同了？无非是帝国主义有原子弹、核武器。这有什么了不起！马克思主义者从来认为，不管技术装备发生什么变化，革命战争的基本规律不会改变。“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”战争的最后胜负，还是靠地面部队的连续战斗，靠人的政治觉悟，靠人的勇敢和牺牲精神，靠步枪、手榴弹，靠拚刺刀，靠近战、夜战，靠几十米内的搏斗。在反对帝国主义的侵略战争中，不管敌人使用什么武器，只要他们敢于深入我国境以内，我们就有了最大的主动权，充分发挥我们的长处和优势，用各种方法打击敌人，大显人民战争的神通，叫他们有来无回。
    他们胡说“敌人进来就不好办了”。这是公开散布失败主义、投降主义的滥调。他们的这种谬论，说穿了，就是怕战争，怕帝国主义，怕革命，怕丢脑袋。毛主席教导我们：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”帝国主义和各国反动派统统是纸老虎，看起来其势汹汹，实际上是最虚弱的。如果他们有胆量对我们发动侵略战争，自己“送货”上门，那就请吧！敌人来得越多，被消灭得越多，我们对世界革命的贡献就越大，这是一件求之不得的天大的好事！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿，疯狂地反对毛主席的积极防御的战略方针，竭力推行消极防御的战略方针，完全是为了适应帝国主义和现代修正主义的政治需要，完全违背了中国人民和世界人民的根本利益，完全背叛了无产阶级革命事业。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的前夕，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的军事路线，进行篡军反党的阴谋已经彻底破产。他所推行的反动资产阶级军事路线，连同他自己，遭到全军广大指战员一致的唾弃。在举国上下高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起革命大批判的高潮，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派中，我们一定要大破资产阶级军事路线，并彻底肃清他们的流毒，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席军事路线的绝对权威，永远突出无产阶级政治，进一步促进全军的思想革命化和组织革命化，永远把枪杆子牢牢掌握在无产阶级手中，保卫无产阶级专政，使我们的无产阶级的铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色！
