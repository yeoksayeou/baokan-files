The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee passed a resolution on September 1, outlining eight specific tasks for the current period: deepening, broadening, and thoroughly carrying out the revolutionary criticism; further developing and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance; seizing power at the district and county levels; launching a larger-scale campaign to support the army and love the people; combining revolution with production; mobilizing the masses to stop armed struggles; strictly prohibiting the incitement of peasants to engage in armed struggles in the city; and relying on the masses to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

New China News Agency, September 10: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee passed a resolution titled "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Achieve New Victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" on September 1, 1967.

The resolution first analyzes the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation currently facing Beijing.

The resolution states: The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents—headed by Peng Zhen—the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee—are being criticized and denounced by the broad revolutionary masses. Their plot to restore capitalism has been smashed. The revolutionary masses of the entire city are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united in their hatred of the enemy, and have launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism. The proletarian revolutionaries have developed from political superiority to organizational superiority and have seized leadership in many departments and units. The great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries is further consolidating, and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" has made great progress. In the Beijing area, the People's Liberation Army has firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and made tremendous efforts and achieved outstanding results in the "three supports, two militaries" work. The revolutionary masses of the entire city have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote production. The situation in industrial production is good. In the suburban rural areas, the summer grain harvest has been a great success, and the autumn crops are also on track for a great harvest.

Most importantly, with the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely disseminated and has penetrated deeper into the hearts of the people, being grasped by more and more people.

The resolution points out that the main task at hand is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrate firepower, focus on targets, and criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. We must carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units and, in the course of the revolutionary criticism, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and complete the various tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The resolution then outlines the eight specific tasks for the current period, which are:

1. Deepen, broaden, and thoroughly carry out the revolutionary criticism;
2. Further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance;
3. Seize power at the district and county levels;
4. Launch a larger-scale campaign to support the army and love the people;
5. Combine revolution with production;
6. Mobilize the masses to stop armed struggles;
7. Strictly prohibit the incitement of peasants to engage in armed struggles in the city;
8. Rely on the masses to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In discussing the deepening, broadening, and thorough carrying out of the revolutionary criticism, the resolution points out that based on the current situation, to carry out the revolutionary criticism well, attention should be paid to the following points:

1. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon for the revolutionary criticism;
2. Mobilize the masses politically and ideologically on a broad and deep scale, and maximize their enthusiasm by adopting various forms and methods of criticism;
3. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the revolutionary criticism, and the Red Guards are the vanguard. Their roles should be fully utilized in the revolutionary criticism;
4. Strengthen leadership, organize a strong leadership team, and carry out the revolutionary criticism in a planned, organized, and prepared manner. The main responsible persons should personally lead the revolutionary criticism and make it the center of all work;
5. Focus on the key issues, emphasize politics, and deepen the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines;
6. Combine the revolutionary criticism with the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in one's own unit, and with promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking;
7. Properly combine revolutionary spirit with scientific spirit.

All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must resolutely implement the regulations of the Central Committee and the Municipal Revolutionary Committee on stopping external connections. Except for those specially permitted by the Central Committee, no students or masses from any unit should go out to make connections, and those who have already gone out should immediately and unconditionally return to their original units.

In discussing the further development and consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance, the resolution states: Proletarian revolutionaries should be models of the revolutionary great alliance. Differences of opinion within the proletarian revolutionaries are normal phenomena and are contradictions within the people, which must be resolved by presenting facts, reasoning, and conducting normal discussions. Methods such as consultation and joint meetings should be adopted, and the issues should be resolved through rectification and self-criticism.

Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries. Proletarian revolutionaries should, on the basis of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seriously carry out rectification, overcome erroneous thoughts such as sectarianism, anarchism, cliquism, regionalism, and individualism.

The class enemy uses various means to sabotage and provoke conflicts among revolutionaries. Proletarian revolutionaries must have a sense of class struggle, prioritize the overall situation, and put revolutionary interests first, and must not fall into the traps set by the class enemy.

In the task of seizing power at the district and county levels, the resolution requires units at the district and county levels (including municipal-affiliated factories, mines, and enterprises, as well as institutions of higher learning) that have not established a "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ to carry out the struggle to seize power and establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. In the struggle to seize power, proletarian revolutionaries must correctly handle the cadre issue and seriously implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

The resolution proposes to launch a larger-scale campaign to support the army and love the people throughout the city. The People's Liberation Army and all proletarian revolutionary organizations, Red Guards, and revolutionary young people should, based on the specific situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in each unit, formulate new agreements to support the army and love the people. Proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses must be vigilant, keep their eyes open, and smash the class enemy's evil plots to sabotage military-civilian relations. Strict measures must be taken against the sabotage activities of active counter-revolutionaries.

The resolution emphasizes the need to take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, use the deep criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road as the driving force, and launch a new wave of the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The resolution states: Proletarian revolutionaries should be models of combining revolution with production. They should insist on local revolution, part-time revolution, and economical revolution, firmly hold their production posts, observe labor discipline, adhere to the eight-hour workday, and strive to increase production, improve quality, save costs, reduce expenses, and strive to fully and over-fulfill the production plan. Workers who have left their production posts should immediately return to their original units to participate in production.

The suburban rural areas should do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest, prevent sabotage by class enemies, and do a good job in autumn harvesting and sowing to ensure a bumper harvest and prepare for a great harvest in the coming year.

In discussing the issue of stopping armed struggles, the resolution states: Armed struggles are often instigated by class enemies. The masses should be mobilized to expose the tricks and conspiracies of the handful of bad elements who instigate armed struggles and completely isolate them. The handful of bad elements who instigate armed struggles and the serious offenders who beat people should be punished by the laws of the proletarian state.

The resolution requires that no one and no organization should, under any pretext, incite peasants to engage in armed struggles in the city. The ringleaders who incite peasants to engage in armed struggles in the city must be thoroughly exposed, resolutely fought against, and punished according to law.

The resolution also points out that the masses should be fully mobilized to rely on the masses to severely crack down on the activities of a handful of criminal elements. Those who are stubborn and unrepentant and those who are extremely wicked should be resolutely punished. The speculation and profiteering activities must be severely cracked down. All revolutionary masses must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from stirring up trouble and fishing in troubled waters. The counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must be resolutely suppressed, and the counter-revolutionary organization "May 16 Corps," which is manipulated by a handful of bad leaders, must be resolutely banned.

In the final section "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought," the resolution requires that the study and application of Chairman Mao's works be placed in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Mao Zedong Thought should truly guide everything, direct everything, criticize everything, and transform everything. In the revolutionary criticism, the bourgeois ideology should be thoroughly criticized, and Mao Zedong Thought should be firmly established. The bourgeois reactionary line should be thoroughly criticized, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line should be firmly established. Mao Zedong Thought should occupy all positions; the masses should be fully mobilized to continuously summarize the experience of the struggle, achieve discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress; Mao Zedong Thought should be used to criticize petty-bourgeois ideology, resist and overcome the vacillation of petty-bourgeois elements, thoroughly criticize selfishness, and firmly establish public spirit. The revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat should be strengthened to achieve the revolutionary transformation of thought; revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, college and university students, and middle school students should, in combination with the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, truly learn Mao Zedong Thought and gradually establish a proletarian worldview; closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry out his instructions without any deviation. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations should, in the course of the struggle, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage and launch a new wave.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利
    北京市革命委员会九月一日通过决议提出当前的八项具体任务：把革命的大批判搞深搞透搞彻底；进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合；搞好区县级单位的夺权斗争；更大规模地开展拥军爱民运动；抓革命，促生产；发动群众，制止武斗；严禁挑动农民进城武斗；依靠群众，加强无产阶级专政。
    新华社十日讯　北京市革命委员会于一九六七年九月一日通过一个题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利》的决议。
    决议首先分析了北京市当前面临着的空前大好的革命形势。
    决议说：中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人——以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团正在受到广大革命群众的批判和声讨。他们复辟资本主义的阴谋被粉碎了。全市革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同仇敌忾，口诛笔伐，掀起了革命的大批判的新高潮。无产阶级革命派从政治上的优势已发展到组织上的优势，在许多部门和单位掌握了领导权。无产阶级革命派的大联合正在进一步巩固，革命的“三结合”得到了很大的发展。在北京地区，人民解放军坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在“三支”、“两军”的工作中作出了巨大的努力，取得了杰出的成绩。全市广大革命群众坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产。工业生产的形势是好的。在郊区农村，夏粮获得了大丰收，秋季作物也是大丰收的局面。
    特别重要的是，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，毛泽东思想得到了广泛的传播，更加深入人心，为越来越多的群众所掌握。
    决议指出，当前，我们面临的主要任务是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，搞好各单位的斗批改，并在革命的大批判中，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，加强无产阶级专政，完成无产阶级文化大革命的各项任务。
    决议接着提出了当前的八项具体任务，这就是：
  （一）把革命的大批判搞深搞透搞彻底；（二）进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合；（三）搞好区县级单位的夺权斗争；（四）更大规模地开展拥军爱民运动；（五）抓革命，促生产；（六）发动群众，制止武斗；（七）严禁挑动农民进城武斗；（八）依靠群众，加强无产阶级专政。
    决议在谈到把革命的大批判搞深搞透搞彻底时指出，根据当前的情况，搞好革命的大批判，要注意以下几点：（1）高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想作大批判的武器；（2）从政治上、思想上广泛地深入地发动群众，最大限度地调动群众的积极性，采用多种形式，人人口诛笔伐；（3）工农兵是革命大批判的主力军，红卫兵小将是革命大批判的急先锋。在革命的大批判中，要充分发挥他们的作用；（4）加强领导，组织坚强的领导班子，有计划、有组织、有准备地进行革命的大批判。主要负责人要亲自挂帅抓革命的大批判，把搞好革命的大批判作为一切工作的中心；（5）抓住要害，突出政治，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争搞深搞透；（6）把革命的大批判同对旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的批判结合起来，同本单位的斗批改结合起来，同促进人的思想革命化结合起来；（7）把革命精神和科学精神很好地统一起来。
    各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织，必须坚决执行中央以及市革命委员会关于停止外出串连的规定，除中央特许的以外，任何单位的学生和群众都不得外出串连，已经外出的应该立即无条件地全部返回原单位。
    决议在谈到进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合时说：无产阶级革命派要成为革命大联合的模范。无产阶级革命派内部存在着这样或那样的意见分歧是正常的现象，是人民内部的矛盾，必须摆事实，讲道理，进行正常的讨论，采取协商和召开联席会议的方式，通过整风和自我批评的方法去解决。
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命派大联合的灵魂。无产阶级革命派要在活学活用毛主席著作的基础上，认真地进行整风，克服小团体主义、无政府主义、宗派主义、山头主义和个人主义等错误思想。
    阶级敌人用各种方式破坏和挑拨革命派之间的关系。无产阶级革命派一定要有敌情观念，顾大局，识大体，以革命利益为重，千万不要上阶级敌人的当。
    在搞好区县级单位的夺权斗争这项任务中，决议要求一些没有建立“三结合”的临时权力机构的区、县级单位（包括市属厂矿企业、高等院校）搞好夺权斗争，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。在夺权斗争中，无产阶级革命派要正确对待干部问题，认真执行毛主席的干部政策。
    决议提出要在全市范围内更大规模地开展一个热烈的拥军爱民的运动。人民解放军同一切无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和一切群众组织，要根据各单位无产阶级文化大革命的具体情况，制定新的拥军爱民公约。无产阶级革命派和广大群众一定要提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，粉碎阶级敌人破坏军民关系的罪恶阴谋。对于现行反革命分子的破坏活动，必须采取专政措施。
    决议强调要以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，以深入批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为动力，进一步掀起增产节约运动的新高潮。
    决议说：无产阶级革命派要做抓革命，促生产的模范。要坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命，坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，坚持八小时工作制，鼓足最大干劲，努力增加产量，提高质量，节约开支，降低成本，力争全面完成和超额完成生产计划。离开生产岗位的职工同志，应该立即返回原单位参加生产。
    郊区农村要做好护秋工作，严防阶级敌人破坏。要搞好秋收秋种，争取丰产丰收，颗粒还仓，并为明年农业的大丰收准备条件。
    决议在谈到制止武斗问题时说：武斗往往是阶级敌人挑起的。要发动群众，戳穿一小撮挑动武斗的坏人的一切阴谋诡计，把这一小撮坏人彻底孤立起来。煽动武斗的一小撮坏人和情节严重的打人凶手，要受到无产阶级国家的法律制裁。
    决议要求任何人和任何组织都一律不准以任何借口，挑动农民进城武斗。对于煽动农民进城武斗的首恶者，一定要彻底揭露，坚决斗争，依法惩办。
    决议还指出，要充分发动群众，依靠群众，狠狠打击一小撮犯罪分子的活动。对那些屡教不改的顽固分子以及罪大恶极的分子，应该坚决予以制裁。要坚决打击投机倒把活动。一切革命群众必须保持高度的革命警惕性，严防国内外阶级敌人挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。必须坚决镇压美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右的反革命破坏活动，坚决取缔“五·一六兵团”这个被一小撮坏头头操纵的反革命组织。
    决议在最后一部分“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗”中，要求把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，真正做到用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，批判一切，改造一切。在革命的大批判中，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，大破资产阶级反动路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，让毛泽东思想占领各个阵地；充分发动群众，不断总结斗争的经验，做到有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进；用毛泽东思想批判小资产阶级思想，抵制和克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，大破私字，大立公字，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，实现思想革命化；革命干部、革命知识分子、大专院校和中等学校的学生，要结合革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，真正学到毛泽东思想，逐步树立无产阶级世界观；紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事。各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织应该在斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，掀起新的高潮。
