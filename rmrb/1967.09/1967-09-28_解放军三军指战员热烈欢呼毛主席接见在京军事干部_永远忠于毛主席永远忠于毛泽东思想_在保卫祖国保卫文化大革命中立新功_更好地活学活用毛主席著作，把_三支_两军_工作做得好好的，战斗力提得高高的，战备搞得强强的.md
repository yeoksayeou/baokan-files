The PLA troops warmly celebrate Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing. They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought. They will achieve new victories in defending the motherland and the Cultural Revolution. They will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, excel in the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks, enhance combat readiness, and strengthen military preparedness.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, the news that our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, after inspecting North China, Central China, and East China, has received military cadres in Beijing on the eve of National Day, has brought immense encouragement and joy to the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed across the country. The entire army, from headquarters to platoons, from officers to soldiers, has been filled with boundless excitement, joy, and happiness all day. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" "Forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!" "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike!" "Carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" and songs like "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" have echoed through the barracks and battlefields.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the PLA, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, pointed out excitedly during the celebrations for Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing that this is another great piece of news following Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. It is a double blessing, truly a double joy. Chairman Mao's reception is the most intimate care, the greatest encouragement, and the strongest motivation for our army. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao closely, listen to every word of Chairman Mao, and carry out every instruction of Chairman Mao. We will definitely firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, excel in the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks, enhance combat readiness, and strengthen military preparedness. In the great struggle to defend the motherland and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution, we will continuously achieve new victories for the people.

Today, from dawn to midnight, troops across the country have held grand meetings, parades, and various celebratory activities with boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. The capital's troops were in a frenzy from early morning. The various headquarters of the PLA, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, the Air Force, the Navy, and the various branches of the military, as well as the Beijing Garrison troops, immediately posted large character posters and held celebration meetings, broadcast meetings, or discussion meetings to celebrate Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres in Beijing upon hearing the broadcast. The soldiers of a certain unit in the Beijing troops, who were about to set out on duty, also hastily prepared cultural performances to spread this great piece of news to all passengers on the train. The troops in Shanghai, Wuhan, Jinan, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, and other places were also in a state of extreme excitement from morning to night. Some held grand celebration meetings and lively discussion meetings, some sent out propaganda teams and joyous teams to report the good news to the revolutionary masses and soldiers in the units, and some quickly spread the great news of Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres through various communication means to dispersed duty units and soldiers executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks in factories and rural areas, so that everyone could share this greatest happiness.

In these exciting celebrations, countless old Red Army soldiers, combat heroes, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, and advanced soldiers who have emerged from the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks have, with the deepest class feelings, the highest reverence, and the most beautiful words of praise, warmly praised the great leader Chairman Mao and expressed their infinite loyalty to him. The officers who participated in this reception in the Beijing troops returned and were so excited that they could not sleep all night. They expressed that they would definitely forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, study until old age, transform until old age, and revolutionize until old age, becoming old soldiers who forever advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and continuously achieve new victories for the people on the magnificent journey of the great communist cause.

The broad masses of soldiers on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks, during the celebrations for Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres, spoke with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm about the great victories and unprecedented good situation of the Cultural Revolution over the past year. They said, "The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today's victory surpasses the past, the world is turned upside down, and the situation is stirring." The Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has brought about earth-shaking changes in our country, achieved the greatest, greatest, and greatest results, and presented an unprecedented good situation.

The soldiers in Tianjin, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Changsha, Hefei, Anshan, Taiyuan, Xining, Guilin, and other places recalled the army's progress over the past year and said that we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and went to the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks. In the sharp and complex struggle, we have greatly deepened our class feelings for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We have greatly enhanced our awareness of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, further strengthened our relationship with the revolutionary masses, washed away the old thoughts and habits in our minds, and greatly advanced the revolutionization of the army's thinking. This army of the people will be even more invincible. Everyone talked more and more happily, more and more excitedly, and unanimously pointed out: Looking back at the past, our confidence is increased a hundredfold; looking forward to the future, the prospects are limitless. Ten thousand victories, a hundred thousand victories, are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The broad masses of soldiers, with high fighting spirit, excitedly expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, do a good job in defending the motherland and supporting the left and loving the people, help the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply, promote revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, grasp the revolution, and promote production, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. The soldiers of the second battalion of a certain unit in the Nanchang garrison said, "We revolutionary soldiers do not believe in heaven, do not believe in earth, and believe most in Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao cares for us like this, and in our future work, we will definitely, like the hero Li Wentong, firmly do as 'Chairman Mao loves me, I love; Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao praises me, I praise; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow.' We will defend Chairman Mao with our lives, and our hearts will never change even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble." The soldiers of the garrisons in Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Kunming, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places have written pledge books and guarantee books. They wrote in their pledge books and guarantee books: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, even the vast East China Sea cannot contain our boundless love for you, and ten thousand words cannot express our boundless loyalty to you. We solemnly swear to forever fight forward with you. You command, and we fight; you point, and we strike!"
