The fundamental question of all revolutions is the question of state power. To run schools well, the first thing to do is to solve the problem of leadership in schools. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." Higher education institutions must also be led by the Party. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party spouts nonsense, saying, "The question of who decides everything in schools is the teachers." Another big capitalist-roader in the Party is even more blatant, saying, "Rightist teachers can also play a leading role." They use every means to oppose the Party's leadership over higher education institutions, relying on a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois intellectuals to impose bourgeois dictatorship on our schools, cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie, and attempt to achieve the evil goal of restoring capitalism in China.

The old Peking University is a typical example of bourgeois dictatorship.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party does not make class analysis and says nonsense like, "Intellectual workers are also part of the working class." Therefore, bourgeois professors are also listed as the "leading class." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Ping, in Peking University, faithfully carries out the intentions of his master. As soon as he arrived at Peking University, under the pretext of "fully utilizing the role of old teachers," he colluded with bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." He openly declared, "The intellectuals of Peking University are basically a proletarian intellectual contingent. According to the standard of supporting the Party and supporting socialism, they are not only red but red in excess." He praised bourgeois professors as having "deep knowledge and expertise," calling them "the treasures of Peking University, the treasures of the state." The notorious revisionist Feng Ding was praised as a "red theorist." The anti-communist veteran Jian Bozhan was praised as an "old Marxist historian." Even more infuriating, the Lu Ping clique "restored the reputation" of a bourgeois reactionary academic "authority" who was thoroughly criticized in the 1958 educational revolution, organizing a thousand-person meeting to celebrate his "teaching" for thirty years. In the fifty-person school affairs committee pieced together by Lu Ping, the majority were bourgeois professors, some of whom were bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities."

Bourgeois intellectuals monopolized the administrative, teaching, and research powers of the school. Their dream of "professors running the school" was realized under the "big red umbrella" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and his lackey Lu Ping. In this way, the Lu Ping clique tightly colluded with them, turning Peking University into a stronghold against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. The bourgeois reactionary academic authority Feng Youlan declared, "Chairman Mao does not solve all problems; academic problems should be decided by professors." The anti-communist veteran Jian Bozhan raised the black flag of "historicism," singing in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and viciously attacking historical materialism. It was extremely arrogant!

However, darkness cannot cover the sun. Under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, a nationwide movement to study Chairman Mao's works surged forward. Revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University broke through numerous obstacles and studied Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm. They organized study groups and held lectures, among other activities. This frightened the Lu Ping clique. They maliciously cursed the revolutionary teachers and students as having "hot-headedness," as being "a sudden surge," and as "forcing others to accept Mao Zedong Thought," and so on. They also wielded the big sticks of "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism" from the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, attempting to suppress the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works.

The Lu Ping clique had extreme hostility towards workers' and peasants' children and revolutionary students, attacking them in every way. From admissions to graduation allocation, from lectures to experiments and exams, they set up numerous barriers for workers' and peasants' children. In admissions, the Lu Ping clique, under the pretext of "selecting the best," emphasized "scores above all," keeping out a large number of workers' and peasants' children. They slandered worker-peasant students as "climbing ladders and adding stools to enter Peking University," and insulted worker-peasant students as "coarse porcelain teacups that cannot be carved with fine patterns," and so on. Not only that, they used methods like "flushing out" to set difficult, strange, and tricky questions, launching "surprise attacks," creating shocking class persecution incidents of "three major areas" (large areas of failure, large areas of retention, and large areas of expulsion), striking and expelling worker-peasant students.

On the contrary, the Lu Ping clique showed great care and meticulous cultivation for those who were the sons and grandsons of landlords and bourgeoisie and rightist students. In the Chinese Department, there was a student from a big capitalist family with extremely reactionary thoughts. The Lu Ping clique treated him as a treasure, cultivating him as a model, and even had the Youth League branch recruit him.

The issue of cultivating and fostering successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause is an extremely important issue concerning the fate of our Party and state. The proletariat must cultivate and foster millions of successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, while the Lu Ping clique strives to cultivate young people into successors of the bourgeoisie. Lu Ping openly declared that Peking University should cultivate a group of "scholars" and "authorities" with "speaking rights" on the international stage, and instructed young teachers to "match up" with bourgeois "authorities" and to arrange successors for bourgeois "authorities." Under the encouragement and indulgence of the Lu Ping clique, bourgeois professors openly used classrooms and textbooks to systematically spread the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. The Lu Ping clique also vigorously promoted "individual struggle," luring young people to follow the white specialist road of burying their heads in books and not asking about politics.

There is oppression, and there is resistance. The broad revolutionary teachers and students resolutely fought against the bourgeois dictatorship of the Lu Ping clique. The Lu Ping clique saw them as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones, mercilessly persecuting and brutally suppressing them. In July 1965, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party instructed the Lu Ping clique to suppress the socialist education movement at Peking University. Later, the Lu Ping clique also carried out a brutal struggle against the proletarian revolutionary faction for seven months.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned down the bourgeois rule of the Lu Ping clique over Peking University, and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party also became rats that everyone wants to beat. We must take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, completely smash the old Peking University, this stubborn bourgeois reactionary stronghold, and create a new Peking University that is red and shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

    彻底摧毁资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治	新北大公社○七六三支队
    一切革命的根本问题是政权问题。要办好学校，首先要解决学校领导权的问题。毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”高等学校也必须由党来领导。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却胡说什么“在学校内决定一切的问题是教员”。党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派说得更露骨，他说：“右派教师也可以起主导作用。”他们千方百计反对党对高等学校的领导，依靠一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级知识分子，对我们学校实行资产阶级专政，培养资产阶级的接班人，妄图达到在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    旧北京大学就是这种资产阶级专政的一个典型。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派不作阶级分析，胡说什么“脑力劳动者也是工人阶级的一部分”。因此，资产阶级教授也被列入“领导阶级”。反革命修正主义分子陆平在北京大学，忠实地贯彻他主子的意旨。他一到北大就在“要充分发挥老教师作用”的幌子下，同资产阶级反动学术“权威”互相勾结。他公然叫嚣：“北大知识分子队伍基本上是无产阶级知识分子队伍。按拥护党、拥护社会主义的标准来说，他们不但红，而且红得有余了。”他吹捧资产阶级教授是“造诣较深、学有专长”的，称他们为“北大的宝贝，国家的宝贝”。臭名昭著的修正主义分子冯定，被吹捧为“红色理论家”。反共老手翦伯赞，被吹捧为“老马克思主义史学家”。更令人气愤的是，陆平一伙还为一个在一九五八年教育革命中被批判得体无完肤的资产阶级反动学术“权威”“恢复名誉”，组织千人大会，庆祝他“任教”三十年。在陆平一手拼凑的五十人校务委员会中，绝大多数是资产阶级教授，有的还是资产阶级反动学术“权威”。
    资产阶级知识分子垄断了学校行政、教学和科研的大权。他们梦寐以求的“教授治校”的幻想，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其奴才陆平的“大红伞”下，得到了实现。就是这样，陆平一伙同他们紧紧地勾结在一起，把北大变成了反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的顽固堡垒。资产阶级反动学术“权威”冯友兰叫嚷：“毛主席也不解决一切问题，学术问题应由教授决定。”反共老手翦伯赞扯起了“历史主义”的黑旗，同毛泽东思想大唱反调，恶毒地攻击历史唯物主义。真是猖狂之极！
    但是，黑手遮不住太阳。在林彪同志的号召下，全国掀起了轰轰烈烈的毛主席著作学习运动。北京大学广大革命师生冲破重重阻力，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。他们组织了学习小组，举办了讲用会，等等。这可吓坏了陆平一伙。他们恶毒地咒骂革命师生是“头脑发热”，是“一哄而起”，是“强迫别人接受毛泽东思想”，等等。他们还挥舞起党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的“简单化”、“庸俗化”和“形式主义”等大棒，妄图把学习毛主席著作的群众运动打下去。
    陆平一伙对于工农子弟、革命学生极端仇视，百般打击。他们从招生培养到毕业分配，从讲课辅导到实验考试，给工农子弟设下了重重关卡。在招生方面，陆平一伙打着“择优录取”的幌子，大搞“分数挂帅”，把大批工农子弟拒于门外。他们污蔑工农同学是“搭梯子、加板凳进入北大的”，辱骂工农同学是“不能雕细花的粗瓷茶碗”，等等。不仅如此，他们还采用“泻肚子”的办法，出偏题、怪题和难题，“突然袭击”，制造了触目惊心的“三大面积”（大面积不及格，大面积留级，大面积退学）的阶级迫害事件，打击和排挤工农同学。
    与此相反，陆平一伙对于那些地主、资产阶级的孝子贤孙和右派学生，却关怀备至，精心培养。中文系有一个出身于大资本家的家庭的学生，思想极端反动。陆平一伙把他视为珍宝，培养他为典型，还要团支部吸收他入团。
    培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题，是关系到我们党和国家命运的极其重大的问题。无产阶级必须培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而陆平一伙则竭力要把青年培养成为资产阶级接班人。陆平公开叫嚷北大要培养一批在国际上“有发言权”的“学者”、“权威”，并指示青年教师跟资产阶级“权威”“对号入座”，要给资产阶级“权威”配备接班人。在陆平一伙的鼓励和纵容下，资产阶级教授公开利用课堂、教材，系统地散布封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货。陆平一伙还大肆鼓吹“个人奋斗”，诱骗青年走埋头读书、不问政治的白专道路。
    有压迫，就有反抗。广大的革命师生对陆平一伙的资产阶级专政进行了坚决斗争。陆平一伙视他们为眼中钉、肉中刺，对他们无情摧残，残酷镇压。一九六五年七月，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派指使陆平一伙扼杀了北大社会主义教育运动。后来，陆平一伙又对无产阶级革命派进行了长达七个月之久的残酷斗争。
    毛主席指出：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，烧毁了陆平一伙对北京大学的资产阶级统治，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派也成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底粉碎旧北大这个顽固的资产阶级反动堡垒，创建一个红彤彤的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新北大！
