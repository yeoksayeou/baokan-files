A fierce battle to "beat the fallen dogs" is unfolding extensively on Shanghai's literary and artistic front. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, with high revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm, are vigorously exposing and criticizing the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his accomplices in their frenzied opposition to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and arts, and their dream of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. They never forget Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not pity snake-like evil people," and vow to smash the revisionist literary and artistic black line thoroughly; to bury the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the vast ocean of the people's war.

This fierce battle to "beat the fallen dogs" is powerful and intense, pushing the revolutionary criticism on Shanghai's film, literature, drama, music, dance, folk art, and fine arts to a new high. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, in the course of the criticism, firmly grasp the key issues of China's Khrushchev betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocating the theory of "extinction of class struggle," and scheming to restore capitalism. They thoroughly expose and criticize his collusion with Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Lin Moquan, and a handful of revisionist counter-revolutionaries in peddling the evil intentions and reactionary nature of revisionist "all-people's literature and arts." They also, in conjunction with the concrete facts of the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines in their units over the past seventeen years, carried out activities to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionist "all-people's literature and arts." Through criticism, they further consolidated and developed the great alliance of the revolutionary forces and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in Shanghai's literary and artistic system; powerfully promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and pushed this great criticism to victory at a higher level.

Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry out revolutionary criticism

In the course of criticism, revolutionary literary and artistic workers never forget to closely unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, forming a vast army of revolutionary critics, with all guns blazing at the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. This is a successful experience of Shanghai's revolutionary literary and artistic workers in carrying out this criticism.

Many literary and artistic units in Shanghai, without affecting the cultural revolution and production in factories and rural areas, use the method of "inviting in" to invite representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers to participate in criticism struggle meetings, criticizing together the revisionist literary and artistic black line and its backstage; or use the method of "going down" to have comrades from literary and artistic units bring poisonous works and related exposure materials to factories, rural areas, and military units, criticizing together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and jointly condemning with pen and mouth.

The violin concerto "The Butterfly Lovers," which was praised by Zhou Yang and his ilk as a model of "nationalization" in China's music world, is a black model of revisionist "all-people's literature and arts." This time, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, criticized "The Butterfly Lovers," forcefully exposing its disguise and revealing the reactionary essence of Zhou Yang and his gang advocating "all-people's literature and arts." The strong class feelings and clear class standpoint shown by the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the criticism made the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music have a deeper understanding of the class nature of literature and arts, and also more clearly recognize that China's Khrushchev and Zhou Yang's gang advocating "all-people's literature and arts" is a version of the theory of "extinction of class struggle" in the literary and artistic field, and is a thorough revisionist product.

Many literary and artistic units have proven with the results of using the method of "open criticism" that workers, peasants, and soldiers are indeed the masters of literature and arts and the main force of the cultural revolution. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have the firmest class standpoint and the clearest class viewpoint. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers to jointly carry out revolutionary criticism make the criticism more convincing, and the key issues are easier to hit. Shanghai's revolutionary literary and artistic workers deeply feel that doing so also makes them further understand what workers, peasants, and soldiers love and hate; doing so also makes them deeply educated, touching their souls, and determined to constantly change their worldview, truly shifting their standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and firmly advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao for literature and arts.

Achieving revolutionary great unity to better criticize China's Khrushchev

Achieving revolutionary great unity is the key to better criticizing the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and to thoroughly eliminating the poison of the revisionist literary and artistic black line. This is another important experience summarized by Shanghai's revolutionary literary and artistic workers from their personal practice.

"Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries." Revolutionary literary and artistic workers on Shanghai's literary and artistic front firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and, to thoroughly overthrow the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and to carry the cultural revolution of the proletariat through to the end, in this high tide of criticism to "beat the fallen dogs," revolutionary literary and artistic workers and revolutionary masses on Shanghai's literary and artistic front have united one after another. The ranks of revolutionary great unity have become more consolidated and stronger. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, with the broad-mindedness of liberating all mankind, unite with all who can be united and mobilize all positive factors, organizing a powerful army of revolutionary great unity, concentrating firepower to fiercely attack the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

In the Shanghai People's Art Theater and the Shanghai Yue Opera Theater, after the revolutionary literary and artistic workers seized power from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, various revolutionary mass organizations, due to different views on some specific issues and the influence of non-proletarian thoughts such as "mountainism" and "small groupism," did not truly unite in their minds, and the "internal war" was quite intense. While the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and reactionary academic "authorities" in these two units took the opportunity to stir up trouble, attempting to stage a comeback. The serious class struggle facts deeply educated the revolutionary literary and artistic workers in these two units, making them realize that: organizational seizure of power is only the first step of the long march, and class enemies will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage. The struggle between seizure of power and counter-seizure of power is still severe. Therefore, if the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line and the literary and artistic black line is not thoroughly eliminated, and China's Khrushchev is not thoroughly criticized and overthrown politically, theoretically, and ideologically, the cultural revolution may be aborted, and capitalist restoration is possible at any time. Thus, various revolutionary mass organizations, based on the spirit of "unity-criticism-unity," sat down together to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of contradictions, have heart-to-heart talks, sincerely exchange views, and make more self-criticisms. In this way, they stopped the "internal war" and truly united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They directed their arrows together at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in their units, launching a high tide of criticism. In every battle of criticism, they closely cooperated, each showing their strengths, and jointly studied materials, mutually learning from and helping each other, continuously pushing the criticism forward.

The proletarian revolutionary forces in the literary and artistic system also patiently helped those cadres who made mistakes but were willing to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, creating conditions for them to "appear on the front line" and "achieve merits on the front line," uniting with them to jointly criticize the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the revisionist literary and artistic black line. Many of them have started to make contributions in the revolutionary criticism, firing "returning arrows."

Combining the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit to thoroughly uproot the social basis of revisionist literature and arts

Shanghai's revolutionary literary and artistic workers have another good experience in this battle to "beat the fallen dogs": they grasp the representative revisionist literary and artistic black line works in their units, expose and criticize them, trace the source, and bring out all the revisionist counter-revolutionaries who promoted and implemented this literary and artistic black line to be exposed. They also directly attack their backstage—the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road—and eliminate all their poison. In this way, they closely combine the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units. Shanghai's literary and artistic workers call this approach: "cutting open the black melon," "finding the black vine," and "digging out the black root."

Over the past seventeen years, a handful of revisionist counter-revolutionaries in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles, at different times, for the restoration of capitalism, have produced batch after batch of feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist "black melons." Such as the reactionary and obscene dramas "Li Huiniang" and "Killing the Son for Revenge" in Peking opera, and "The Young Madam's Fan" in Shanghai opera, were performed on stage by a handful of revisionist counter-revolutionaries as "refined traditional good plays." Even the Peking opera "Hai Rui's Memorial," the animated film "The Proud General," the storytelling "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and "The First Fast Train of Socialism" and other big poisonous weeds that attack the Party and the Three Red Banners, were "enfeoffed" by Zhou Yang and his ilk as "excellent works," strutting on the socialist stage, rampant for a time. What is even more infuriating is that, under the instruction of China's Khrushchev, the reactionary film "Sparking the Plains" and the film "City That Never Sleeps" that glorify the "merits of exploitation" by the bourgeoisie, were screened again and again, poisoning the whole country. This is intolerable! Revolutionary literary and artistic workers on Shanghai's literary and artistic front have raised the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, smashing the "black melons," pulling out the "black vines," and digging out the "black roots" one by one. They deeply realized from their own battle practice that only by closely combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units can revolutionary literary and artistic workers see the reactionary nature of the revisionist literary and artistic black line, see the reactionary face of China's Khrushchev and Zhou Yang's gang in restoring capitalism, and thus arouse the greatest class hatred, thoroughly overthrow this handful of revisionist counter-revolutionaries, and smash the bourgeois headquarters; at the same time, only by closely combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units can the social basis of the revisionist literary and artistic black line be uprooted, its poison eliminated, and each literary and artistic unit built into a completely red propaganda station that serves workers, peasants, and soldiers, letting the boundless flame of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought forever shine on Shanghai's literary and artistic front.

The Shanghai Pioneer Storytelling and Ballad Troupe, which has only been established for a short six or seven years, has performed more than a hundred poisonous and problematic storytelling and ballad programs due to the dominance of the revisionist literary and artistic black line. How should the criticism be carried out? The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Pioneer Storytelling and Ballad Troupe, following Chairman Mao's teachings, "Once the main contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved," decided to systematically sort out the problems within the troupe, see how these problems are related to the revisionist literary and artistic black line and its backstage, and what the key issues are. After careful investigation and research, comparison and analysis, the problems finally came out one by one. They clarified the focus, grasped the key issues, and decided to start with the big poisonous weed "The First Fast Train of Socialism" that attacks the Great Leap Forward, thus pushing the revolutionary criticism to a new high. The revolutionary comrades of the Pioneer Storytelling and Ballad Troupe further realized in the criticism the importance of literary and artistic workers going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They decided to live a lifetime among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, shifting their thoughts, feelings, and class standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating and performing storytelling and ballad programs that truly reflect the new era of socialism and praise Mao Zedong Thought.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary criticism is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in criticism

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for the vast revolutionary forces to "beat the fallen dogs." Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary criticism is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in criticism.

Revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai, in the course of criticism, place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. In this way, they continuously push this criticism from one high tide to another, from one victory to another. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, on the one hand, use the demon-revealing mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, exposing their reactionary true colors in broad daylight. On the other hand, they, in the course of criticism, aim at the problems existing in themselves, and study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively and pertinently, firing at the "self" in their minds, touching their souls, changing their worldview, and forging themselves into steadfast revolutionary fighters of the proletariat and loyal red propagandists of Chairman Mao, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The proletarian revolutionary forces in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively organize big-character poster columns, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the revisionist literary and artistic black line politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

　　组成浩浩荡荡的批判大军直捣文艺黑线总后台
　　——本报记者评述上海文艺战线革命大批判形势
    本报讯　本报记者述评：一场痛打“落水狗”的“人民战争”，正在上海文艺战线上深入广泛地开展。广大革命文艺工作者以高昂的革命斗志，饱满的革命干劲，猛揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙疯狂对抗毛主席革命文艺路线，梦想颠覆无产阶级专政的滔天罪行。他们念念不忘伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”，誓把反革命修正主义文艺黑线彻底砸烂；把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海里。
    这场痛打“落水狗”的“人民战争”，声势大，火力猛，把上海电影、文学、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈和曲艺、美术等各条文艺战线上的革命大批判推向了一个新的高潮。广大革命文艺工作者在大批判中，紧紧抓住中国的赫鲁晓夫背叛无产阶级专政、鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”、处心积虑地妄图复辟资本主义等要害，彻底揭发批判他同周扬、夏衍、田汉、林默涵等一小撮反革命修正主义分子贩卖修正主义“全民文艺”的罪恶目的和反动本质，并结合本单位十七年来两个阶级、两条路线剧烈斗争的具体事实，开展了大力清除修正主义“全民文艺”流毒的活动。通过大批判，进一步巩固和发展了上海文艺系统无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”；有力地推动了活学活用毛主席著作的群众性运动，促使这场大批判在更高的水平上胜利进行。
    革命的文艺工作者同工农兵在一起，进行革命的大批判
    革命的文艺工作者在大批判中，时刻不忘与工农兵紧密结合，组成浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，万炮齐轰党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，这是上海广大革命文艺工作者在开展这场大批判中的一条成功经验。
    上海许多文艺单位的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在不影响工厂、农村文化大革命和生产劳动的前提下，有的采用“请进来”的办法，邀请工农兵代表参加批判斗争会，一起批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台；有的采取“带下去”的办法，由文艺单位的同志带着毒草作品和有关的揭发材料，下厂、下乡、下部队，同工农兵一起批判，一起口诛笔伐。
    被周扬之流吹捧为中国乐坛上的“民族化样板”的大毒草小提琴协奏曲《梁山伯与祝英台》，是修正主义“全民文艺”的黑样板。这次，上海音乐学院的革命师生和工农兵共同批判《梁祝》，有力地剥开了它的画皮，暴露了周扬一伙鼓吹“全民文艺”的反动实质。工农兵群众在批判中表现出来的强烈的阶级感情和鲜明的阶级观点，使上海音乐学院的革命师生对文艺的阶级性有了更加深刻的理解，也更加清楚地认识到中国的赫鲁晓夫和周扬一伙鼓吹的“全民文艺”，就是“阶级斗争熄灭论”在文艺界的翻版，是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。
    许多文艺单位采用“开门批判”办法所取得的效果雄辩地证明：工农兵不愧为文艺的主人，不愧为文化大革命的主力军。工农兵阶级立场最坚定，阶级观点最鲜明，革命文艺工作者同工农兵相结合，共同开展革命的大批判，批判就更有说服力，要害问题就更容易击中。上海广大革命文艺工作者深深体会到，这样做，也使自己进一步认识了工农兵爱什么，恨什么；这样做，更使自己深受教育，触到了灵魂，决心不断改造世界观，把立足点真正移到工农兵方面来，坚定不移地朝着毛主席指引的文艺方向前进。
    实现革命的大联合，才能更好地批判中国的赫鲁晓夫
    实现革命的大联合，才能更好地批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，才能肃清修正主义文艺黑线的流毒。这是上海的革命文艺工作者从亲身实践中总结出来的又一条重要经验。
    “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”上海文艺战线上的无产阶级革命派牢记毛主席这一教导，为了彻底打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在这场痛打“落水狗”的大批判高潮中，上海文艺战线上的无产阶级革命派、革命群众纷纷联合起来，革命大联合的队伍越来越巩固、越来越强大。无产阶级革命派以解放全人类的宽阔胸怀，团结一切可以团结的人，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，组织起革命大联合的强大队伍，集中火力向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。
    在上海人民艺术剧院、上海越剧院，无产阶级革命派夺了本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大权之后，各个革命群众组织由于对一些具体问题有不同看法，加上“山头主义”“小团体主义”等非无产阶级思想的影响，因此思想上没有能真正联合起来，“内战”一直打得比较激烈。而这两个单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反动学术“权威”，趁机兴风作浪，妄图反攻倒算。严重的阶级斗争事实，深刻地教育了这两个单位的无产阶级革命派，使他们认识到：组织上的夺权，只是万里长征的第一步，阶级敌人绝不会自动退出历史舞台，夺权与反夺权的阶级斗争仍然严重存在。因此，不把资产阶级反动路线和文艺黑线的流毒彻底肃清，不把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、理论上、思想上彻底批深批倒，文化大革命就有夭折的危险，资本主义复辟是随时可能的。于是，各个革命群众组织都本着“团结——批评——团结”的精神，坐下来共同学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作，严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，相互谈心，真诚交换意见，多作自我批评，从而停止了“内战”，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下真正团结起来。他们把矛头共同指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在本单位的代理人，掀起了大批判高潮。在每场批判的战斗中，他们密切配合、各展所长，并且共同研究材料，互相学习帮助，把大批判不断地推向前进。
    文艺系统的无产阶级革命派还耐心帮助那些犯有错误但真心愿意回到毛主席革命路线上来的干部，为他们创造“火线亮相”、“火线立功”的条件，团结他们一起大造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反。他们中不少人大杀“回马枪”，在革命大批判中开始作出了贡献。
    把大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，彻底铲除修正主义文艺的社会基础
    上海广大革命文艺工作者，在这场痛打“落水狗”的战斗中的另一条好经验是：抓住本单位有代表意义的修正主义文艺黑线作品，进行揭发批判，追根溯源，把推行和贯彻这条文艺黑线的一小撮反革命修正主义分子统统揪出来示众，并且直捣他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，肃清他们的一切流毒。这样，就把大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来了。上海的文艺工作者把这种做法叫作：抓住“黑瓜”开刀，顺瓜摸到“黑藤”，顺藤挖出“黑根”。
    十七年来，上海文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在不同的时期，为复辟资本主义，结出了一批批封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的“黑瓜”。如京剧《李慧娘》和《杀子报》，沪剧《少奶奶的扇子》等反动的和黄色的戏剧，都被一小撮反革命修正主义分子当作“提炼过的传统好戏”搬上舞台。甚至连攻击党和三面红旗的京剧《海瑞上疏》、美术片《骄傲的将军》、评话《海瑞骂皇帝》、《社会主义第一列飞快车》等等大毒草，也被周扬之流“晋封”为“优秀作品”，在社会主义的舞台上，张牙舞爪，嚣张一时。更令人气愤的是，在中国的赫鲁晓夫的授意下，为其篡党、篡军、篡政和复辟资本主义制造舆论准备的反动影片《燎原》和美化资产阶级“剥削有功”的影片《不夜城》，一映再映，流毒全国，是可忍，孰不可忍！上海文艺战线上的广大无产阶级革命派，奋起了毛泽东思想千钧棒，狠狠砸烂“黑瓜”，一一拉出“黑藤”，连连挖掉“黑根”。他们从自己的战斗实践中深刻地认识到，只有把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密地结合起来，才能使革命文艺工作者看清楚反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反动本质，看清楚中国赫鲁晓夫及周扬之流复辟资本主义的反动嘴脸，从而激起最大的阶级仇恨，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子彻底打倒，把资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁；同时，也只有把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，才能铲除修正主义文艺黑线的社会基础，肃清它的流毒，把每个文艺单位建设成为完全彻底为工农兵服务的红色宣传站，让光焰无际的毛泽东文艺思想，永远普照在上海文艺阵地上。
    建团只有短短六七年的上海先锋评弹团，由于反革命修正主义文艺黑线占了统治地位，上演的毒草和有严重问题的评弹节目就达一百多部。大批判究竟如何着手进行？先锋评弹团的革命文艺工作者遵循毛主席“捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”的教导，决定系统地排一下团内的问题，看看这些问题和反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台到底有多大关系，要害问题究竟是什么。经过细致的调查研究，分析比较，问题终于一个个地排出来了。他们明确了重点，抓住了要害，决定首先从攻击大跃进的大毒草评话《社会主义第一列飞快车》开刀，这样就把革命的大批判推向了新高潮。先锋评弹团的革命同志在大批判中进一步体会到文艺工作者深入工农兵群众的重要性，他们决心在工农兵群众中生活一辈子，把思想感情、阶级立场彻底移到工农兵这方面来，创作和演出真正能反映社会主义新时代和歌颂毛泽东思想的评弹节目。
    用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判，是搞好大批判的根本保证
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是广大无产阶级革命派痛打“落水狗”的最锐利的武器。活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅革命的大批判，是搞好大批判的根本保证。
    上海的革命文艺工作者，在大批判中把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。这样就把这场大批判不断地从一个高潮推向一个高潮，从一个胜利引向一个胜利。广大革命文艺工作者一方面用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，来揭发批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命言行，把他们的反动原形暴露在光天化日之下。另一方面，他们在大批判中针对本身存在的问题，有的放矢地活学活用毛主席著作，向头脑里的“私”字开火，狠触灵魂，改造世界观，按照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》所指出的方向，把自己锻炼成坚定的无产阶级革命战士，锻炼成永远忠于毛主席的红色宣传员。（附图片）
    上海文艺界无产阶级革命派，为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，积极组织大字报专栏，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭修正主义文艺黑线。
