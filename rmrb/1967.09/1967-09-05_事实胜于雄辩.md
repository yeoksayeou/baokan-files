Recently, the Soviet revisionist journalist Koshkov, who was expelled from our country, spread lies in the Soviet revisionist weekly "New Times," claiming that the Cultural Revolution has caused "adverse effects" on China's economy, that "many Chinese people cannot eat meat or drink milk, and even dare not look at sugar, eggs, and oil," and that in the countryside, it is suggested that farmers only eat vegetables and wild roots, and so on. The lies Koshkov fabricated are not new; they are just some old rubbish taken from the bag of lies of the revisionist leader Khrushchev.

The wings of a crow cannot block the sun. Koshkov's clumsy lies can only be "lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet," and they do not harm the glory of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the slightest.

Our people have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," with high spirits and ardent fighting will. In the triumphant songs of the Cultural Revolution, industry and agriculture have achieved one great victory after another. This year, China's grain, cotton, oil, sugar, pork, vegetables, and fruits, and other agricultural and pastoral production have again seen a bumper harvest. In the first half of the year, not only did summer grain and rapeseed increase by about 10%, but the procurement of pigs, cattle, and sheep also increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last year. These facts eloquently demonstrate that the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up an extremely broad prospect for the continuous leap in China's industrial and agricultural production, and the urban and rural markets present a thriving scene.

Take the grain situation, for example. On the basis of consecutive increases in recent years, 1966 saw a significant increase over 1965. The grain harvest was the best since liberation. The living standards of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside have generally improved. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's wise instructions to "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." While over-fulfilling the state's procurement plan, they have planned to increase the collective grain reserves and correspondingly improved the lives of the commune members. Koshkov's so-called "suggestion that farmers only eat vegetables and wild roots" is a complete lie.

Now let's look at China's production of subsidiary foodstuffs. The sales of meat, vegetables, and fruits are better than ever. In 1966, the year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, compared to 1965, the sales of pigs, poultry, milk powder, and sugar increased by 14% to 25%. Vegetable oil increased by 5.4%. The increase in fruits is particularly notable, with the sales of major fruits such as apples, pears, and oranges in 1966 increasing by 50% compared to 1965. The per capita consumption of pork increased by 9% in urban areas and 18% in rural areas. The supply of eggs has also increased. These living facts have given Koshkov a resounding slap in the face!

In China's food markets, people can freely choose the food they like. China's food is not only abundant in quantity, diverse in variety, rich in color, and good in quality, but also cheap in price. The subsidiary food markets are filled with pork, eggs, and fresh vegetables. Such abundant supply is something the Soviet revisionists can only dream of. All foreign visitors to China have seen with their own eyes the rich and varied commodities on China's markets. Koshkov, who lived in China for five years, in order to curry favor with his masters, deliberately distorted the true situation of China's markets and spread lies, which only further exposed his ugly face as a Soviet revisionist lackey.

Shameless slander cannot harm the Chinese people even a little, and lies repeated a thousand times will not become the truth, nor can they cover the eyes of the Soviet people.

Looking through the reports in Soviet newspapers and magazines over the past few years, one can see a series of helpless confessions and lamentations, "grain production is far from completing the plan" and "the speed of agricultural development is rapidly declining," so "it is necessary to go to the international market to purchase a large amount of wheat." Recently, the Soviet revisionists have signed an agreement with Canada to import 400 million jin of wheat. It is these Soviet revisionist wastrels who have reduced the Soviet Union, with its vast and fertile land, to the point of relying on foreign imports for grain, bringing serious difficulties to the lives of the Soviet people.

Khrushchev had a notorious "theory," that is, the "communism" of "potatoes with beef." The successors of Khrushchev, Brezhnev and Kosygin, are going further and further down the road of surrendering to imperialism abroad and restoring capitalism at home, and their days are getting harder and harder. On the dining tables of the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union, they can't even eat vegetables, and "potatoes with beef" is just a pie in the sky. On November 22 last year, a special correspondent of "Pravda" reported: "Many farms failed to complete the potato procurement plan. The city party committee held a meeting of leaders of various organs to 'urge' the delivery of potatoes," stipulating that "students and doctors must each deliver a sack. Those who do not have potatoes must pay money. Some people buy potatoes from other regions and then 'deliver' them to the state." This "robbing Peter to pay Paul" practice reflects that Soviet agricultural production has reached a dead end. The Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich also admitted that from 1961 to 1965, the production of potatoes decreased. "Now, the production of beef is far from meeting the needs of the state, and the current cattle are extremely insufficient to produce meat." Killing the hen to get the egg, lacking potatoes, and not enough beef, Khrushchev's "communism" has failed. This is a great irony for his successors!

Currently, the privileged class of the Soviet revisionists is living a decadent bourgeois life, while the laboring people are becoming more and more miserable. "Labor" reported: "There are no potatoes and macaroni in the workers' canteens, no meat and canned meat." In the hotel's comment book, someone wrote: "We have not eaten vegetables and potatoes for a long time." The broad masses of the Soviet people cannot buy vegetables, fresh meat, and dairy products. In May of this year, "Moscow Evening News" published a dialogue between a customer and a saleswoman that is worth pondering:

"Are there apples?"
"No."
"Lemons and oranges?"
"No."
"Carrots are probably available, right?"
"No," the female saleswoman answered habitually.

This is not an isolated case. This situation, where even daily necessities are in short supply, is the inevitable result of the rampant capitalism of the Soviet revisionists. Today, in the Soviet Union, although the season of abundant vegetables has arrived, "the shelves of vegetable stores are still empty." They have to travel far and wide to bring in garlic from the UAE, green beans from Bulgaria, and tomatoes from Eastern European countries to decorate those embarrassing shelves. These foreign goods are indeed "too expensive" for ordinary residents, "they even dare not look at them." On June 27, "Moscow Evening News" published a piece of "good news" about vegetable price reductions: tomatoes are 2 rubles per kilogram (equivalent to 1.28 yuan for more than a jin in China). At the same time, in Beijing, tomatoes can be bought for 0.10 yuan for three jin.

On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, on the day when the "seven-year plan" boasted by the traitorous leadership of the Soviet revisionists has been completed, in the Soviet Union, in Lenin's hometown, such a desolate and desperate scene has appeared, how can it not make people think deeply?! Due to the implementation of a series of revisionist policies such as "profit-first," "material incentives," "open free markets," and "encourage private economy" by the Soviet revisionist leadership, the socialist economy of the Soviet Union has already degenerated into a capitalist economy, and capitalist forces in cities and countryside are becoming more and more rampant, exacerbating class division. The Soviet people are suffering twice and enduring twice the hardship. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to cover up the fact of capitalist restoration, blames the poor situation in agricultural production on "bad weather." This is sheer nonsense! The president of the All-Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lobanov, once frankly admitted in "Pravda": "It is incorrect to attribute the low grain yield in many regions of the state solely to the insufficiency of mineral fertilizers and poor weather conditions."

Chairman Mao pointed out, "Opportunists who try to block the tide are almost everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable, socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, throwing all obstacles behind its back." The glorious people of the Soviet Union will certainly overthrow the Soviet revisionist leadership and trample all those parasites and bloodsuckers under their feet. The red flag of Leninism will once again fly over the Kremlin. Let the storm of revolution be more violent!

　　事实胜于雄辩
　　农业部革命造反总部
    不久前，被我国驱逐出境的苏修记者科修科夫，在苏修《新时代》周刊上大造谣言，胡说什么文化大革命对中国经济造成了“恶果”，“许多中国人既吃不到肉也喝不到牛奶，甚至不敢看一看糖、鸡蛋和油”，在农村里“建议农民只吃蔬菜和野菜根”，等等。科修科夫编造的这套谣言，并不是什么新鲜货色，不过是从修正主义头目赫鲁晓夫的造谣皮包中拣来的一些破烂而已。
    乌鸦的翅膀遮不住太阳。科修科夫的拙劣造谣，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，丝毫无损于我国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉。
    我国人民响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在文化大革命的凯歌声中，工农业生产取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。今年，我国的粮、棉、油、糖及猪肉、蔬菜、水果等农牧业生产又是一个丰收的年景。上半年，不仅夏粮和油菜籽增产百分之十左右，猪、牛、羊的收购量也比去年同期增加百分之十以上。这些事实雄辩地说明了无产阶级文化大革命的逐步深入，为我国工农业生产的持续跃进，开辟了无限广阔的前途，城乡市场呈现一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    以粮食情况来说，在近几年连续增产的基础上，一九六六年比一九六五年又有大幅度的增长。粮食收成是解放以来最好的一年。广大农村的贫下中农生活普遍提高。他们坚决贯彻毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的英明指示，在超额完成国家征购计划的同时，有计划地增加了集体粮食的贮备，并相应地改善了社员的生活。科修科夫的所谓“建议农民只吃蔬菜和野菜根”，是彻头彻尾的造谣。
    再看一下我国的副食品生产。肉类、蔬菜和水果的购销情况空前大好。无产阶级文化大革命的一九六六年与一九六五年比较，生猪、家禽、奶粉、食糖等销售量分别增加百分之十四至百分之二十五。植物油增加百分之五点四。水果的增加尤为突出，苹果、梨、柑橘等主要水果的销售量一九六六年比一九六五年增长百分之五十。猪肉按人口计算，平均每人年消费量，城镇增加百分之九，乡村增加百分之十八。鸡蛋的供应量也增加了。这些活生生的事实给了科修科夫一记响亮的耳光！
    在我国食品商场里，人们可以任意选购所喜爱的食品。我国的食品不仅数量足、品种多、花色全、质量好，而且价钱便宜。副食商场上摆满着猪肉、鸡蛋和色泽鲜嫩的蔬菜。这样充沛的供应情况是苏修望尘莫及的。凡是访问过中国的外国客人，都亲眼看到了我国市场上丰富多样的商品。曾经在中国住了五年之久的科修科夫，仰承其主子的鼻息，为了勾结美帝和反华的需要，故意歪曲我国市场的真实情况，散布谎言，这只能进一步暴露他作为一个苏修御用文人出卖灵魂的丑恶面目。
    无耻的诽谤损伤不了中国人民的半根毫毛，谎言重复千百遍也成不了真理，也遮掩不住苏联人民的耳目。
    翻开近几年来苏联报刊的报道，人们就可以看到一篇篇无可奈何的自供状，一声声怨天尤人的哀叹，“谷物产量远远没有完成计划”和“农业发展速度急剧下降”，因而“不得不去国外市场大量购买小麦”。最近苏修又与加拿大签署了一项进口四十亿斤小麦的协定。正是这些苏修败家子，把拥有广阔肥沃土地的苏联沦落到依赖国外进口粮食的地步，给苏联人民的生活带来了严重的困难。
    赫鲁晓夫有个臭名昭著的“理论”，就是“土豆烧牛肉”的“共产主义”。继承赫鲁晓夫衣钵的勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，在对外投靠帝国主义，对内复辟资本主义的道路上正越走越远，日子也越来越难过。在苏联广大劳动人民的饭桌上蔬菜尚且吃不到，“土豆烧牛肉”更是画饼充饥。去年十一月二十二日《真理报》特派记者曾报道说：“许多农庄完不成马铃薯采购计划。市党委召开各机关领导人会议，‘催促’交售马铃薯”，规定“学生、医生每人都要交一麻袋。没有马铃薯就交钱。有的人从别的地区买来马铃薯再‘交售’给国家”。这种“拆东墙补西墙”的做法，正是反映了苏联农业生产已经到了山穷水尽的地步。苏修农业部长马茨凯维奇也供认，一九六一年至一九六五年期间，土豆的生产量下降了。“现在，牛肉产量远未满足国家的需要，用现有的牛来产肉是极其不够的。”杀鸡取不了蛋，土豆缺乏，牛肉不够，赫鲁晓夫的“共产主义”落了空。这对他的继承者来说真是一个莫大的讽刺！
    目前，苏修的特权阶层过着腐朽的资产阶级生活，而劳动人民则愈来愈苦。《劳动报》报道：“工人的食堂里没有马铃薯和通心粉，没有肉和罐头肉”。在饭店的意见簿上，有人写道：“我们已经有很长时间没有吃蔬菜和马铃薯了。”广大的苏联人民买不到蔬菜，买不到鲜肉和奶制品。今年五月《莫斯科晚报》上曾刊登过一段顾客与售货员之间的耐人寻味的对话：
    “有苹果吗？”
    “没有。”
    “柠檬和柑橘呢？”
    “没有。”
    “胡萝卜大概有吧？”
    “没有。”女售货员习惯地答道。
    这绝不是个别现象。这种连一般日常生活食用品都感到缺乏的情况，正是苏修资本主义泛滥的必然恶果。在今天的苏联，尽管盛产蔬菜的夏季到来了，“但是蔬菜商店的货架上仍然是空的”。因而不得不跋涉远洋，运来了阿联的大蒜、保加利亚的豆角、东欧国家的西红柿，来点缀那些令人难堪的货架。这些外国商品，对一般居民来说，确实是“过于昂贵”了，“甚至不敢看一看”。《莫斯科晚报》六月二十七日刊登了一则蔬菜降价的“好消息”：西红柿每公斤为二卢布（折合人民币为一元二角多一斤）。同一时期，在北京的西红柿一角钱却可买到三斤。
    正当十月革命五十周年的前夕，正当苏修叛徒领导集团所一再吹嘘的“七年计划”期满的今天，在苏联，列宁的故乡，却出现了这样光景萧条，日暮途穷的惨景，怎不发人深省？！由于苏修领导集团实行“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“开放自由市场”、“鼓励私人经济”等一系列修正主义政策，使苏联的社会主义经济已经蜕化成为资本主义的经济，城乡资本主义势力日益猖獗，加剧了阶级分化，苏联人民正在受二遍罪，吃二遍苦。苏修领导集团为了掩饰其资本主义复辟的事实，把农业生产上的不景气，归罪于“天气不好”。这纯粹是欺人之谈！全苏农业科学院院长洛巴诺夫在《真理报》上就曾经直言不讳地供认：“仅仅用矿肥不足和天气条件不好来作为国家许多地区的谷物产量低的原因，是不正确的”。
    毛主席指出，“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”具有光荣历史的苏联人民终将打倒苏修领导集团，把那些寄生虫、吸血鬼统统踩在脚底下，列宁主义的红旗将重新飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空。让革命的暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！
