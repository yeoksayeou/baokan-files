	Despite Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Strongest Protest, Indian Troops Launch More Fierce Attacks on Our Forces; Revolutionary Masses in Lhasa Condemn Indian Reactionaries' Provocations

	Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 12th – According to continuous reports from our Tibet border defense forces: The Indian invading troops, which on the 11th launched a serious military provocation against our Tibet border defense forces, today became even more rampant in their artillery attacks on our border defense forces at the Naiqula Pass and Zela Pass on the Sino-Indian border.

	From 11:00 PM on the 11th to 7:00 PM today when this dispatch was sent, the Indian reactionary government, disregarding the most urgent and serious protest lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday with the Indian side, continued to order the Indian invading troops to launch even more serious military provocations against our border patrol units. They have been relentlessly shelling our side with heavy artillery. As of the time of this dispatch, the Indian military provocations show no signs of stopping, and the situation continues to develop. Our relevant authorities are continuing to closely monitor the situation.

	In response to the Indian invading troops' even more rampant military provocations, our border patrol units, unable to endure it any longer, were forced to retaliate in self-defense.

	The Indian reactionary government, which has aligned itself with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has made itself a mess at home and abroad. In the face of domestic unrest and rebellion, in order to maintain its shaky rule, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, it has launched military provocations against our country, which will not save it from its internal and external troubles. We once again warn the Indian reactionary government: Do not miscalculate. You must stop at the brink and immediately cease your military provocations and war adventures against China. Otherwise, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will not let you off easily and will surely give the invading enemy a crushing blow.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 12th – The proletarian revolutionary forces, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in Lhasa have held rallies and parades, expressing their indignation and strong condemnation of the Indian reactionaries' military provocations on the Sino-Indian border, which have resulted in the deaths and injuries of our border guards. They have declared: We will hold high the banner of "Supporting the Army and Loving the People," strengthen military-civilian unity, promote revolution, prepare for war, and promote production and work, ready at any time to fight shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Tibet border defense forces to thoroughly and completely annihilate all invading enemies.

	Today, the streets of Lhasa are plastered with large banners reading "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Down with Soviet Revisionism!" "Down with the Indian Reactionaries!" The proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups, as well as the militia, who attended the rally, were filled with righteous indignation and burning anger at the Indian reactionaries' military provocations. In their speeches, they pointed out that we proletarian revolutionaries not only have to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road but also have to rebel against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. After the Indian invading troops injured two of our border guards by crossing the border on the 7th, they continued to provoke us with gunfire and artillery on the 11th, killing and injuring 36 of our border guards. The Indian reactionaries, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have launched military provocations. If they do not stop their adventurism immediately, they will once again suffer a crushing defeat. The militia warriors also swore to Chairman Mao: "Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but not an inch of our motherland's territory will be lost. As soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will fight side by side with the PLA and leave the Indian reactionaries without a single piece of armor!"

    不顾我外交部提出最严重抗议
    印军更疯狂地向我军进行炮击
    拉萨革命群众愤怒声讨印度反动派挑衅罪行
    新华社拉萨十二日电　据我西藏边防部队继续报告：十一日向我西藏边防部队进行严重军事挑衅的印度侵略军，今天在中锡边界乃堆拉山口、则里拉山口更加猖狂地向我边防部队进行炮击。
    从十一日二十三时至今天十九时发电时止，印度反动政府不顾我国外交部昨天向印方提出的最紧急、最严重的抗议，继续命令印度侵略军向我边防执勤分队进行更加严重的军事挑衅，以重炮向我方疯狂射击，炮火一直持续不断。截至发电时止，印军的军事挑衅毫无停止迹象，事态仍在进一步发展。对此，我有关方面正在继续密切注视。
    对于印度侵略军这种更加疯狂的军事挑衅，我边防执勤分队忍无可忍，被迫进行了自卫还击。
    由于投靠美帝苏修，把自己弄得焦头烂额的印度反动政府，在国内人民纷纷起来造反的情况下，为了维持其摇摇欲坠的统治，在美帝、苏修的唆使下，向我国进行军事挑衅，绝不能挽救其内外交困的处境。我们再次警告印度反动政府，你们不要错打了算盘，必须悬崖勒马，立即停止对中国的军事挑衅和战争冒险。否则，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，是不会轻饶你们的，必将给予来犯之敌以毁灭性的打击。
    据新华社拉萨十二日电　拉萨无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和各族革命群众纷纷集会游行，愤怒声讨和强烈谴责印度反动派在中锡边界进行军事挑衅，打死打伤我边防战士的滔天罪行。他们表示：决心更高地举起“拥军爱民”旗帜，加强军民团结，抓革命，促战备、促生产、促工作，随时准备和英雄的西藏边防部队并肩战斗，坚决彻底干净全部消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    今天，拉萨街头贴满了“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒印度反动派！”等大幅标语。集会的拉萨无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众、民兵等，对印度反动派的军事挑衅，个个义愤填膺，怒火万丈。他们在发言中指出，我们无产阶级革命派，不仅要造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，还要造帝国主义的反，造修正主义的反，造一切反动派的反。印度侵略军在七日越境刺伤我边防战士二名后，又在十一日打枪打炮，继续向我边境挑衅，打死打伤我边防战士三十六名。印度反动派在美帝苏修指使下，猖狂地发动军事挑衅，如不立即停止冒险，必将再次碰得头破血流。集会的民兵战士还向毛主席宣誓：头可断，血可流，祖国领土一寸不能丢，只要毛主席一声令下，我们就立即同解放军并肩战斗，把印度反动派打个片甲不留！
