	I love Chairman Mao, I love him,
	I support Chairman Mao, I support him,
	I praise Chairman Mao, I praise him,
	I follow Chairman Mao's instructions, I follow them.
		— Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong

	Fighting the Rapids, Heroically Sacrificing Themselves
	This heroic deed took place in the revolutionary cradle—northeast of Jinggangshan, in the lower reaches of the Gan River.

	Following the orders of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the 6011 unit, which had been sent to Jiangxi to support the left, dispatched a small team on August 19, 1967, to cross the Gan River with some local revolutionary rebels. They escorted the revolutionary rebels from Changchun District back to the countryside to make revolution.

	This small team was the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of a certain unit, which, following Chairman Mao's teachings, held high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people."

	Before the team set out, the young platoon leader and Communist Party member, Comrade Li Wenzhong, and the ten soldiers who were to carry out the escort mission, recited together the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is a people's army. It is entirely for the people. It is completely for the people's interests." He excitedly told the soldiers, "The mission we are undertaking is arduous and glorious. We are protecting the revolutionary masses, protecting the young revolutionaries, which is to protect Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At critical moments, we must stand up, and if necessary, we must be willing to sacrifice our lives." With the utmost trust, he asked the soldiers, "Comrades, do you have the resolve?"

	The soldiers, who had just studied Vice Chairman Lin Biao's latest instructions on August 9 and were greatly inspired, decided to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They responded with the firmest and loudest voices:
		"Yes!"

	The truck carrying the revolutionary youngsters and the Fourth Platoon soldiers sped towards the ferry. At the ferry, everyone got off the car and looked at the river. They saw the vast waters of the Gan River, with boats sailing smoothly. However, after Li Wenzhong organized the soldiers of his platoon and dozens of female Red Guards and some revolutionary rebels to board the boat, he still reminded everyone, "Sit steady and pay attention to safety." He also designated a few soldiers who were good swimmers to take off their uniforms in case of an emergency.

	The boat headed steadily towards the north bank of the Gan River. However, no one expected that in the rapids less than half a mile from the shore, the boat suddenly began to sway. Water splashed onto the boat, and Li Wenzhong, while calmly using a pole to deflect the water, raised everyone's courage with the powerful words of Chairman Mao, "Be determined, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At this moment, the bow of the boat suddenly sank. Li Wenzhong, who was sitting at the bow, had half his body submerged in the water. He immediately stretched out his hands to block the Red Guards next to him to prevent them from falling into the water. He encouraged everyone to "stay calm!" and issued an emergency order to the soldiers to rescue the Red Guards. However, before he could finish speaking, due to the rapid sinking of the bow, fifty or sixty Red Guards and revolutionary rebel soldiers had already fallen into the rapids.

	The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were fearless in the face of danger, selfless, and brave. They fought heroically against the raging currents.

	Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong, who loved the little Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought infinitely, fearlessly rushed towards one Red Guard after another, successfully rescuing four young revolutionaries and a middle-aged woman. At this time, some soldiers saw that Li Wenzhong could no longer hold on, so they swam over to save him. However, he ordered in a commanding tone:
		"Don't worry about me, save the Red Guards first, quickly—quickly!" Saying this, he used his last bit of strength to swim towards another group of Red Guards awaiting rescue....

	Communist Party member and deputy squad leader Li Congquan, although he was not a good swimmer, disregarded his own safety and pushed a small wooden board, rescuing Red Guards over and over again.

	Communist Party member and soldier Chen Diankui, who had been discharged from the hospital only three days ago and was not yet fully recovered, also rushed into the rapids and rescued Red Guards multiple times.

	Communist Party member and squad leader Pang Chaosheng, with his infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and his heart full of love for the revolutionary youngsters, with his fearless revolutionary spirit of sailing ten thousand miles in the vast ocean, cut through the waves, eager to rescue all the Red Guards who had fallen into the water in one breath. He reached back and pushed a Red Guard to the side of the boat, letting her grab the side. Then, he quickly swam to the side of five or six Red Guards who were being swept away by the rapids, pulling this one and that one, quickly getting them out of danger. Then he looked back and saw a revolutionary rebel comrade struggling to save someone with a small piece of wood, so he went over to help the comrade save the person to the shore.

	After the heroic struggle of the Fourth Platoon and the local revolutionary rebels, more than fifty Red Guards and revolutionary masses were saved. However, the good soldiers of Chairman Mao, Comrades Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui, sacrificed their lives to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to protect the proletarian revolutionary masses.

	The rescued Red Guards sat on the riverbank, gazing at the river for a long time, an hour passed, two hours, three hours... They could not drink water, could not eat, and how they hoped that Comrade Li and the others could return safely! When Li Wenzhong's body was fished out of the water, the Red Guards wept uncontrollably, and some burst into tears. With boundless respect and profound sorrow, they covered the body of Comrade Li Wenzhong with the red banner that had inspired them to advance....

	Rain and Dew Nourish the Seedlings, Revolutionaries Rely on Mao Zedong Thought

	The Fourth Platoon created touching deeds of loving the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, relying on their infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on the invincible proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and relying on the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	When the world-shaking Chinese Red Guards movement just began, and some soldiers could not yet deeply understand it, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong, who loved, was loyal to, believed in, and worshipped Chairman Mao infinitely, said to the soldiers in the platoon:
		"Our great leader Chairman Mao supports and loves the Red Guards. Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao praises me, I praise him; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow his instructions." Li Wenzhong's lofty belief inspired all the soldiers in the platoon. From then on, they loved the Red Guards from the bottom of their hearts. During the days when the Red Guards were making revolutionary long marches on foot, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon provided water for the passing Red Guards, gave them quotations from Chairman Mao, learned from them, and paid tribute to them. On the Gan River, Chen Diankui, who sacrificed his life to rescue the Red Guards, saw a young Red Guard with a backpack and blisters on his feet, struggling to walk on the long march. He carried the backpack for him, walked a few miles, and then walked a few more miles, a total of seven or eight miles. The young revolutionary was full of revolutionary optimism and repeatedly expressed his determination to overcome difficulties with the spirit of the Red Army not fearing the hardships of the long march. Only then did Comrade Chen Diankui return to the company with peace of mind.

	In April of this year, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong brought Chairman Mao's instructions on "military training" to a certain middle school to help with military and political training, studying and fighting alongside the Red Guards. There was a Red Guard who had a good revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and the ghosts and snakes were afraid of him. Those with conservative thoughts seized on his individual shortcomings and said he was an "adventurist." However, Comrade Li Wenzhong firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, enthusiastically praised this revolutionary youngster, humbly learned from him, and encouraged him to always maintain his revolutionary spirit of rebellion.

	At the end of July, the Fourth Platoon was stationed in a certain factory to support the left. In the storm of class struggle, they took Chairman Mao's great instruction, "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses," as the highest criterion for all their actions. They said, "Chairman Mao entrusted us with the task of supporting the left, which is the greatest trust and care for us. We must do a good job of supporting the left and bring glory to Chairman Mao!" "To do a good job of supporting the left, we must have the stance, thoughts, feelings, and actions of the left. We have only one heart with the left, not two hearts." In the factory, they always stood firmly and clearly, resolutely standing on the side of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary youngsters. The sweet words and tears of the conservative forces could not deceive the keen eyes of the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon; the criticisms and attacks of the conservative forces could not shake the soldiers' determination to support the left.

	After Comrades Li Wenzhong and others sacrificed their lives, the revolutionary rebels in the factory and the broad revolutionary youngsters in the local area were all deeply saddened. After the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon left the factory to carry out new tasks, many revolutionary rebels and Red Guards traveled over mountains and rivers, walking more than a hundred miles, to visit and learn from the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon.

　　无限忠于毛主席的好战士
　　——记6011部队某部六连四排奋勇抢救红卫兵小将的英雄事迹
　　毛主席热爱我热爱，
　　毛主席支持我支持，
　　毛主席称赞我称赞，
　　毛主席指示我照办。
            ——排长　李文忠
　　奋战激流　英勇献身
    英雄事迹发生在革命摇篮——井冈山东北的赣江下游。
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席和林彪副主席的命令，进驻江西支左的六○一一部队，于一九六七年八月十九日，派出一支无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的小分队，和当地部分革命造反派一起，横渡赣江，护送蒋巷区革命造反派，由南昌市返回农村闹革命。
    这支小分队，就是遵照毛主席的教导，高举“拥军爱民”伟大旗帜的某部六连四排。
    小分队出发前，年轻的四排长、共产党员李文忠同志和前去执行护送任务的十名战士，同声背诵伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”他心情激动地对战士们说：“我们担负的护送任务是艰巨的、光荣的。我们保卫无产阶级革命派，保卫革命小将，也就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在紧要关头，我们要挺身而出，必要的时候，我们不惜献出自己的生命。”他怀着最大的信任，问战士们：“同志们，有没有决心？”
    刚刚学习了林彪副统帅八月九日的最新指示，受到极大鼓舞，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功的战士们，最坚决、最响亮地回答：
      “有！”
    载着革命小将和四排战士的汽车，向渡口飞驰。在渡口处，大家下了车，了望江面，只见赣水苍茫，一艘艘木船，安然地航行着。但是，李文忠同志在组织本排战士和数十名女红卫兵以及部分革命造反派上船后，还是提醒大家：“要坐稳，注意安全。”并且指定水性好的几个战士，脱下军衣，预防发生意外。
    渡船朝着赣江北岸平稳地驶去。可是，谁都没有想到，就在离对岸不到半里的激流处，船身竟突然摇晃起来。江水溅上船，李文忠一面镇定地用扁担拦水，一面用“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这段威力无穷的毛主席语录，提高大家的勇气。就在这时，船头陡然下沉。坐在船头的李文忠，半个身子淹没在水中。他立即伸展双手，拦住身边的红卫兵小将，以防她们跌到船外去，一面鼓励大家“要沉着！”一面向战士们发出了抢救红卫兵的紧急命令。可是，话音未落，由于船头急速下沉，五六十名红卫兵小将和革命造反派战士，已掉进了激流之中。
      用毛泽东思想武装起来的四排指战员，个个临危不惧，不怕牺牲，舍己救人，英勇地和急流展开了搏斗。
    无限热爱毛主席的红小兵的排长李文忠同志，奋不顾身，扑向一个又一个红卫兵小将，连续救起了四个小将和一个中年妇女。这时，有的战士看到李文忠已经支持不住了，便游过去救他。可是，他以命令的口吻说：
  “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧，快——快！”说着，他用尽最后的气力，游向了另一批待救的红卫兵。……
    共产党员、副班长李从全同志，虽然不大会水，但他把个人安危置之度外，推着小木板，一次又一次地抢救红卫兵小将。
    共产党员、战士陈佃奎同志，出院才三天，病还没有完全好，也冲进激流，多次抢救了红卫兵小将。
    共产党员、班长庞朝胜同志，凭着无限忠于毛主席的革命路线、无限热爱革命小将的一颗红心，以他曾在惊涛骇浪的大海里遨游万米的大无畏的革命气概，斩波劈浪，恨不得一口气把所有失水的红卫兵小将全部救上来。他反手一把，将他身后的一个红卫兵托到船边，让她抓住船帮。接着，他飞速游到正在被激流冲走的五六个红卫兵身边，拉这个一把，拉那个一把，使她们很快脱了险。然后他回头望望，看到一位革命造反派战友，正在艰难地用一块小木板救人，便过去协助这位战友把人救到岸上。
    经过四排同志和当地革命造反派的英勇奋战，五十多个红卫兵和革命群众得救了。但是，毛主席的好战士李文忠、李从全和陈佃奎三位同志，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为保卫无产阶级革命派，献出了自己的生命。
    被救的红卫兵小将，坐在江岸上，久久地久久地凝视着江面，一个小时过去了，两个小时、三个小时……过去了。她们喝不下水，吃不下饭，多么希望李排长他们能够安全地回来啊！当李文忠同志的遗体被打捞上来的时候，红卫兵小将个个泣不成声，有的失声痛哭起来。她们怀着无限崇敬和无比沉痛的心情，把鼓舞自己前进的鲜红的战旗，轻轻地盖在李文忠烈士的身上……。
　  雨露滋润禾苗壮干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
    四排在无产阶级文化大革命中，创造出感人的爱民事迹，靠的是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，靠的是战无不胜的毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引，靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育。
      当震撼世界的中国红卫兵运动刚刚兴起，有的战士一时还不能深刻理解的时候，对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的排长李文忠，就对排里同志说：
  “我们伟大领袖毛主席，支持、热爱红卫兵。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席称赞我称赞，毛主席指示我照办。”李文忠这个崇高的信念，感召着全排的战士。从那时起，他们就从心眼里热爱着红卫兵。在红卫兵进行革命的步行大串连的日子里，四排的战士们为路过的红卫兵送开水，赠毛主席语录，向他们学习，向他们致敬。在赣江为抢救红卫兵而光荣牺牲的陈佃奎同志，当时看到一个年幼的红卫兵，背着背包，脚上打了很多泡，在长征路上艰难地行走着，便替他背背包，送了一程又一程，一直送了七八里。那位小将充满了革命乐观主义精神，一再表示要用红军不怕远征难的精神去战胜困难。陈佃奎同志这才放心地返回连队。
    今年四月，排长李文忠带着毛主席关于
  “军训”的指示，来到某中学帮助搞军政训练，和红卫兵小将学习在一起，战斗在一起。有一位红卫兵小将，革命造反精神好得很，牛鬼蛇神见了他怕得要死，有保守思想的人抓住他的个别缺点，说他是“盲动主义者”。而李文忠同志却坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，热情地赞扬这位革命小将，虚心地向他学习，并且和他一起学习毛主席著作，勉励他永葆革命造反精神。
    七月底，四排进驻某工厂支左。在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，他们把毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，当作自己一切行动的最高准则。他们说：“毛主席他老人家把支左任务交给我们，这是对我们最大的信任，最大的关怀。我们一定要支好左，为毛主席争光！”“要支好左，就要有左派的立场，左派的思想，左派的感情，左派的行动。”“我们和左派只有一颗心，没有两颗心”。在厂内，他们始终立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决地站在革命造反派、革命小将一边。保守势力的甜言蜜语和诉“苦”的眼泪，蒙蔽不了四排战士敏锐的眼睛；保守势力的责难和攻击，丝毫动摇不了四排战士支左的决心。
    李文忠等同志光荣牺牲后，厂内的革命造反派和当地的广大革命小将无不痛惜万分。当四排的战士远离工厂去执行新的任务后，许多革命造反派和红卫兵小将跋山涉水，步行百余里，向四排战士慰问、学习。
