The Philippine Liberation Army, led by the Communist Party of the Philippines, has recently achieved continuous victories by leveraging its guerrilla warfare tactics.

On September 5, the Philippine Liberation Army ambushed a patrol unit of the Philippine government's "security forces" in the province of Bulacan, north of Manila, killing several enemy soldiers. Although the Philippine authorities later mobilized a large number of troops for a "suppression campaign," they found nothing but empty air.

According to incomplete statistics published in Philippine newspapers, from January to August this year, the Philippine Liberation Army initiated fourteen offensive operations, annihilating a significant number of enemy forces and seizing a large amount of weapons.

While striking against reactionary military and police forces, the Liberation Army also supports peasants in their struggle against traitors and tyrants in the countryside. In the past eight months, Liberation Army soldiers have executed approximately thirty landlord tyrants on behalf of the people, earning the support and backing of the broad masses of impoverished peasants.

Philippine newspapers also reported that at the beginning of this year, three hundred peasants joined the Liberation Army to engage in armed struggle.

    新华社八日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾共产党领导的菲律宾人民解放军，发挥游击战的特长，最近不断出击获胜。
    九月五日，菲律宾人民解放军在马尼拉以北的打拉省伏击一支菲律宾政府“保安军”巡逻队，打死敌人数名。菲律宾当局后来虽然调动大批部队“围剿”，但是扑了一个空。
    据菲律宾报纸发表的不完全统计，今年一月到八月，菲律宾人民解放军主动出击达十四次，在战斗中歼灭了不少敌人，缴获了大批武器。
    人民解放军在打击反动军警的同时，还在农村中支持农民锄奸反霸的斗争，在今年的八个月中，解放军战士为人民处决了约三十名地主恶霸，受到广大贫苦农民的拥护和支持。
    菲律宾报纸还报道，今年初就有三百名农民参加了人民解放军，进行武装斗争。
