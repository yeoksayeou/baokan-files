The warehouse I helped build in Kathmandu is inaugurated

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The warehouse in Kathmandu, built with Chinese aid, was inaugurated today. Attending the ceremony were Nepal's Queen Ratna, Prime Minister Suriya Bahadur Thapa, Charge d'Affaires Li Zhonghe of the Chinese Embassy, Chinese experts, Nepalese workers, and about 500 people from various walks of life.

Nepal's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Gunjeshwari Prasad Singh, said in his speech, "The warehouse built with Chinese assistance is a symbol of the development of Nepal-China friendship. Neighboring China has always been concerned about Nepal's economic development." The successful completion of the Kathmandu warehouse is the result of close cooperation and joint efforts between Chinese experts armed with Mao Zedong Thought and the hardworking Nepalese people. It is a crystallization of the friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

Chinese workers and technicians, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, displayed internationalism in their work, fearing neither hardship nor difficulty, and selflessly imparted their skills to Nepalese workers, forging deep friendships with them. In July, when the Chinese experts returned home, Nepalese workers traveled from afar to see them off, wishing long life to the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao!

The opening ceremony for the Sana'a-Sada road is held

Yemeni President Saleh, accompanied by Charge d'Affaires Zheng Kangping of the Chinese Embassy, laid the foundation stone for the road and delivered a speech. Saleh said: "The construction of this road is a very great and important project. In the past, the Yemeni people have cooperated well with Chinese experts. We hope that the Yemeni people will cooperate even better with Chinese experts in the construction of the Sana'a-Sada road."

Charge d'Affaires Zheng Kangping and the head of the Chinese expert group, Yang Bin, also spoke at the meeting. When they mentioned the name of the great leader Chairman Mao in their speeches, the vast crowd waved their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China!"

Training Yemeni Sailors

DAR ES SALAAM, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- With Chinese assistance, Tanzania has begun training its own sailors. The first batch of 11 Tanzanian trainees have recently boarded the "Cooperation" cargo ship of the China-Tanzania Joint Shipping Company to receive training in navigation technology.

When these Tanzanian trainees boarded the ship, a Chinese sailor, on behalf of all Chinese sailors, expressed his welcome, saying that passing on navigation technology and experience to Tanzanian brothers is the internationalist duty of Chinese sailors.

The Tanzanian director of the shipping company, Buhatiwa, in his speech, thanked China for its selfless aid to Tanzania. He said that now, independent Tanzania has established its own shipping lines and begun training its own sailors to develop Tanzania's shipping industry, so that it will no longer be controlled by imperialism. Tanzanian trainee representative Ruvyanzija praised the internationalist spirit shown by Chinese sailors under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

Later, the Chinese color documentary "East Is Red" was shown to entertain the Tanzanian trainees, and the film was warmly received by them.
