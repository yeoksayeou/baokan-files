The Vietnamese people in the southern provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Tri have been actively leveraging their initiative on the battlefield to turn the area south of the demilitarized zone into a graveyard for U.S. aggressors.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province, active in the area south of the demilitarized zone, have been continuously striking the enemy from August 1 to September 10 over the course of 40 days. They have annihilated and disbanded over 8,000 enemy forces, including nearly 4,500 U.S. aggressors. They have also destroyed and severely damaged six enemy battalions, 21 companies, 29 platoons, and five "pacification" units.

In addition, the military and civilians of this province have also destroyed 214 enemy vehicles, 36 cannons and mortars, shot down or destroyed 127 enemy aircraft, blown up 20 bridges, burned down eight ammunition depots, five fuel depots, and nearly 300 barracks.

The report states that in this period of over a month, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province have launched a series of fierce attacks on the enemy's headquarters and other military bases in Tam Ky, Hoi An, and Da Nang, killing and wounding many American aggressors and inflicting heavy losses on them. In the battle of shelling the Norman U.S. military airfield on August 27 alone, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province destroyed 40 enemy aircraft and killed or wounded 150 U.S. aggressors. During this period, the local military and civilians also fought several very successful counter-"sweeping" battles, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On August 1 and 12, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province bravely intercepted the enemy's "sweeping" forces in the vicinity of Vinh Dien County and Thuan Phuoc County, annihilating two enemy main force battalions. Following this great victory, the military and civilians of this province fiercely counterattacked the U.S. Marine Corps' "sweeping" in the Giai Son area from September 4 to 6, achieving the glorious results of annihilating and severely damaging seven companies and one battalion command of the U.S. forces.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on September 27, the liberation armed forces of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam launched a full day of fierce artillery attacks on the U.S. military base in Kon Tum south of the demilitarized zone on September 25, causing the enemy to fall into chaos and suffer heavy casualties. According to a U.S. military spokesman, at least 200 American aggressors were killed or wounded.

Western news agencies reported in shock that this was the most concentrated and fierce bombardment of Kon Tum by the liberation armed forces in recent times. "The shells came so fast, it was as if they were falling from the sky. They fell like rain." "In just 15 minutes, 200 to 500 shells hit Kon Tum."

    发挥主动优势　把非军事区以南变成美国侵略者的坟场
  　南越广南省军民四十天歼敌八千多
    广治省解放武装力量再次猛轰昆天美军据点打得敌人一片混乱死伤累累
    新华社河内二十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，活跃在非军事区以南的越南南方广南省军民大力发挥战场上的主动优势，从八月一日到九月十日的四十天中连续打击敌人，共消灭和瓦解敌人八千多名，其中包括美国侵略军近四千五百名，歼灭和重创敌军六个营、二十一个连、二十九个排和五个“绥靖”队。
    此外，这个省的军民还击毁敌人军车二百一十四辆、大炮和迫击炮三十六门，击落击毁敌机一百二十七架，炸毁桥梁二十座，烧毁弹药库八座、汽油库五座和营房近三百间。
    报道说，广南省军民在这一个多月里，先后向三岐、会安、岘港等敌军首脑机构和其他军事基地发动了一系列的猛烈攻击，杀得美国强盗死伤累累，损失惨重。仅在八月二十七日炮击诺曼美军机场的战斗中，广南省军民就一举击毁敌机四十架，打死打伤美国侵略军一百五十名。在这期间，当地军民还打了几场非常漂亮的反“扫荡”战，给敌人以大量杀伤。八月一日和十二日，广南省军民在维川县和先福县附近英勇截击前来“扫荡”的敌人，共歼灭伪军两个主力营。继这个巨大胜利之后，这个省军民九月四日到六日在桂山地区又猛烈反击美国海军陆战队的“扫荡”，取得了歼灭和重创美军七个连和一个营指挥部的辉煌战果。
    据新华社二十七日讯西贡消息：越南南方广治省解放武装力量二十五日又对非军事区以南的昆天美军据点进行了一整天猛烈的炮击，打得敌人一片混乱，死伤累累。据美国军方发言人透露，至少有二百多名美国强盗被打死打伤。
    西方通讯社的消息惊呼，这是最近以来解放武装力量对昆天“最集中和最猛烈的一次轰击”。“炮弹来得如此之快，就好象从天上来的一样。它们象雨点一样地落了下来。”“在仅仅十五分钟内，就有二百发至五百发炮弹击中了昆天。”
