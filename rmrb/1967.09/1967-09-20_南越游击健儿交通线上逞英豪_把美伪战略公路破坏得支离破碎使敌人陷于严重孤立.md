According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 18, according to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, in late August to early September, the Liberation Army and guerrillas in the southern region of South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on the enemy's transportation lines, annihilating over a thousand enemy troops, and destroying or damaging numerous enemy vehicles and ships.

In My Tho Province, the military and civilians from August 31 to September 6 in one week almost completely cut off all enemy transportation lines within the province, especially the Fourth Highway. They continuously attacked enemy forces along the highway, ambushed road repair and "sweeping" enemy forces, annihilating and dismantling nearly 800 enemy troops.

Guerrillas also frequently attacked enemy forces on waterways. On August 29, the guerrillas in Vinh Thanh Commune, Chau Thanh District, Dinh Tuong Province intercepted an enemy ship convoy, sinking four motorboats and damaging one. On August 23 and 24, the guerrillas in Kien Giang Province also sank two enemy patrol boats.

Guerrillas are the most active force in conducting transportation warfare. From August 27 to 31, the guerrillas in Can Tho Province consecutively blew up four important highway bridges over four nights.

In the first week of August, the guerrillas in An Xuyen Province launched consecutive attacks on the inter-provincial highway, cutting off multiple sections of the road and blowing up two large bridges. The enemy's major strategic highways, such as the First Highway running north-south and the Ninth Highway south of the Demilitarized Zone, were all severely damaged by the guerrillas. The enemy's transportation lines near their stronghold in Saigon were also frequently cut off by the guerrillas, causing the enemy-occupied cities and bases to be severely isolated, and military transportation and supplies to be extremely difficult.

On August 21, the guerrillas in Quang Nam Province ambushed an enemy convoy with landmines on a road near Da Nang, flipping over two military vehicles, resulting in the complete annihilation of the enemy troops on the vehicles.

In the two provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien south of the Demilitarized Zone, and in the central and southern provinces of South Vietnam, the guerrillas and local forces continuously surrounded and attacked enemy outposts and sentry posts on transportation lines, ambushed passing American and puppet troops, and annihilated a large number of enemy troops.

    把美伪战略公路破坏得支离破碎使敌人陷于严重孤立
    据新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方南部地区各省解放军和游击队，在八月底到九月初猛烈袭击敌人的交通线，歼灭上千名敌军，并击毁击伤敌军许多军车和船只。
    美萩省军民在八月三十一日到九月六日一周内，几乎切断了省内敌人的全部交通线，特别是第四号公路，同时连续进攻公路沿线的守敌，袭击修路和“扫荡”的敌人，共消灭和瓦解敌人近八百名。
    游击队还在河道上频频袭击敌人。迪石省周城县永盛乡游击队，八月二十九日截击敌人的一个船队，击沉汽艇四艘，击伤一艘。金瓯省游击队八月二十三日和二十四日也击沉敌机动艇两艘。
    游击队是打交通战的最活跃的力量。芹苴省游击队在八月二十七日到三十一日的四个晚上接连炸毁重要公路桥梁四座。
    槟椥省游击队八月初在省际公路上接连出击，切断公路多段和炸毁大桥两座。敌人的横贯南北的交通大动脉第一号公路、非军事区以南的第九号公路等重要战略公路，都被游击队搞得支离破碎，敌人老巢西贡附近的交通线也经常被游击队切断，使敌人占领的城市和基地陷于严重孤立，军事运输供应非常困难。
    八月二十一日，广南省游击队在岘港附近的公路上用地雷伏击敌人的车队，炸翻军车两辆，车上敌人全部伤亡。
    在非军事区以南的广治、承天两省和南越中部和南部各省，游击队和地方部队都不断在交通线上包围和袭击敌人的据点和哨所，伏击过往的美伪军，消灭了大量敌人。
