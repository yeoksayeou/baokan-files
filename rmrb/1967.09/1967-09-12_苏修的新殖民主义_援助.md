The Soviet revisionists' "aid" to Asian and African countries is nothing but a new form of colonialism. The facts in India provide the most obvious evidence.

The Soviet "aid" is just like the American "aid," a policy of buying off the Indian reactionaries. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique provides large amounts of rubles and weapons, encouraging and supporting the Indian reactionaries in their frenzied anti-China activities. The more fervently the Indian reactionaries engage in anti-China activities, the more rewards they receive from the Soviet revisionist clique.

The Soviet "aid" is just like the American "aid," aimed at propping up the Indian reactionaries and suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the Indian people. The reactionary rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, represented by the Indian National Congress, has fallen into a serious crisis. It is under these circumstances that the Soviet revisionist clique provides large-scale financial support to the Indian reactionaries, helping them maintain their shaky reactionary rule.

The Soviet "aid" is just like the American "aid," aimed at turning the recipient countries into their puppets. Through "aid," the Soviet revisionist clique has taken control of many key sectors of India's economy, creating a severe dependence of India on the Soviet revisionist clique in terms of funds, technology, equipment, and trade. The Indian government borrows new debts to repay old ones, owing the Soviet revisionist clique an insurmountable debt. The more "aid" India accepts from the Soviet Union, the more it damages its independence and sovereignty, and the more it becomes colonized.

The Soviet "aid" is just like the American "aid," a means of exploiting and plundering the recipient countries. Under the guise of "aid," the Soviet revisionist clique uses high-interest loans, dumping of goods, arms sales, unequal trade, and even establishing so-called "Soviet-Indian joint ventures" to plunder India's resources and exploit the blood and sweat of the Indian people. The Soviet revisionist clique's tactics are no different from those of imperialism and are entirely learned from imperialism.

The Soviet revisionist clique often boasts that economically backward countries, by relying on their "aid," can take the "non-capitalist path." How nice it sounds! But what is the reality after they have "experimented" in India for ten years? The Indian reactionaries are not taking the "non-capitalist path" but are clearly following the path of colonialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "American imperialist 'aid' is like the legendary fisherman who uses a baited hook. Those who take the bait will suffer stomachaches."

The Soviet "aid" is just like the American "aid," both are new colonialist goods. Accepting American "aid" and relying on it will bring misfortune; accepting Soviet "aid" and relying on it will likewise bring disaster.

For countries like India, the urgent task facing their people is to resolutely oppose the new colonialism of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Only by driving out the colonialist forces of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism and overthrowing the reactionary rule propped up by American imperialism and Soviet revisionism can they achieve true independence.

### 苏修的新殖民主义“援助”

    苏修的新殖民主义“援助”
    苏修集团对亚非国家的“援助”，究竟是什么货色？印度的事实提供了最明显的例证。
    苏“援”同美“援”一样，是对印度反动派实行的一种收买政策。苏修叛徒集团拿出大量的卢布和军火，鼓励和支持印度反动派疯狂反华。印度反动派反华越起劲，苏修集团给的犒赏也就越多。
    苏“援”同美“援”一样，是为了扶植印度反动派，阻止和镇压印度人民的革命斗争。以印度国大党为代表的大地主、大资产阶级的反动统治，已经陷于严重危机。正是在这种情况下，苏修集团给印度反动派大量输血，帮助他们维持摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    苏“援”同美“援”一样，是为了把受“援”国变为自己的附庸。苏修集团通过“援助”，控制了印度经济的许多要害部门，造成印度在资金、技术、装备和贸易方面对苏修集团的严重依赖。印度政府借新债，还旧债，欠了苏修集团一屁股还不清的阎王债。印度接受苏“援”越多，就越损害自己的独立主权，就越殖民地化。
    苏“援”同美“援”一样，是对受“援”国进行剥削和掠夺的一种手段。苏修集团以“援助”为名，通过高利息的贷款，商品倾销，军火输出，不等价贸易，直到建立所谓“苏印合营”企业，掠夺印度的资源，榨取印度人民的血汗。苏修集团搞的这一套，同帝国主义没有区别，而且完全是从帝国主义那里学来的。
    苏修集团经常吹嘘说，经济落后国家，只要依靠他们的“援助”，就可以走上“非资本主义道路”。说得多么好听！可是，他们在印度已经“试验”了十年之久，事实是怎样的呢？印度反动派走的哪里是什么“非资本主义道路”，而是不折不扣的殖民地的道路。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：美帝国主义的“援助”，是“太公钓鱼，愿者上钩。嗟来之食，吃下去肚子要痛的。”
    苏“援”同美“援”，都是新殖民主义的货色。接受美“援”，依赖美“援”，是要倒霉的；接受苏“援”，依赖苏“援”，同样要遭殃。
    象印度这样国家的人民面临的迫切任务，就是要坚决反对美帝和苏修的新殖民主义。只有把美帝和苏修的殖民主义势力统统赶走，推翻美帝苏修所扶植的反动派的统治，才能够取得真正的独立。
