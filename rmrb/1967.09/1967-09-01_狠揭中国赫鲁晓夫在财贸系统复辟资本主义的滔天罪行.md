The revolutionary cadres of the financial and commercial departments of the State Council, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters.

Determined to overthrow and thoroughly expose the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, closely linking the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, and thoroughly eliminating his revisionist poison.

Reported by our newspaper: The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of the financial and commercial departments of the State Council, in response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, concentrate their firepower and targets to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Committee of the financial and commercial departments of the State Council has held several meetings to systematically criticize the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Attacking Socialism and Promoting Capitalism

The proletarian revolutionary fighters of the Ministry of Commerce and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation angrily exposed that after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the Chinese Khrushchev put forward a counter-revolutionary revisionist line against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which aimed to develop capitalism. He vigorously resisted Chairman Mao's economic work policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and issued a series of black directives in commercial work, vigorously promoting the capitalist line and methods of operation. He sang high praises for the so-called "progressiveness" of commercial capitalists and openly advocated that socialist commerce should learn from the capitalist's profit-seeking business practices. In 1957, during a discussion with the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee on commercial work, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously attacked socialism, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, saying, "The current methods show that capitalism is superior to socialism. Our costs, labor productivity, and profit rates are all lagging behind. Do not be deluded that socialism will definitely progress more than capitalism. The result is that we are not as good as capitalism in many ways, and thus socialism will perish." He also said, "Now we should learn from private merchants and peddlers. Company managers should lead the way to the countryside to buy a few chickens, and responsible persons and Party members should set an example." The Chinese Khrushchev issued these absurd statements to alter the nature of socialist commerce. After the Party's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce achieved decisive victory in 1956, he impatiently advocated "absorbing capitalists to form an advisory council," letting them "serve as advisors and strategists," and allowing them to direct the work. In the commercial system of our country, he established so-called "business improvement committees," letting capitalists study our country's commercial plans and settings, and allowing them to "inspect" the work and propose "improvement" suggestions. At the same time, he demanded that the commercial departments "learn from capitalists, learn capitalist management methods," saying "socialism is becoming more and more stagnant." "We should vigorously promote deferred sales" and "buy one, get one free," etc., so that "we can make more money." In short, in his mind, there is only one word: "money." The proletarian revolutionary comrades of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative also exposed that the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, vigorously promoted "cooperativeism," saying that "rich peasants can join consumer cooperatives as consumers, and landlords, merchants, and capitalists can also be consumers. They should be treated like cooperative members to promote their products, supply materials to them, and distribute dividends." He attempted to turn the socialist supply and marketing business into a capitalist "cooperative." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses indignantly pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev has extended his black hand into the commercial departments, attempting to change the color of socialist commerce. We will not agree to this in a thousand ways, nor in ten thousand ways.

While the Chinese Khrushchev was trying to make socialist commerce "peacefully evolve," he vigorously promoted the opening of free markets, saying, "It seems that the larger the free market, the better.... The free market is beneficial to us." He eliminated class struggle in the market, allowing capitalist forces to spread freely, which was another of his conspiracies to restore capitalism. The proletarian revolutionary fighters of the Central Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Administration exposed a large number of facts, proving that the Chinese Khrushchev was the protector of speculators in the market. In the autumn of 1962, after Chairman Mao issued the great call of "never forget class struggle" at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, revolutionary cadres and masses across the country enthusiastically responded to this call and resolutely struck down the speculators who appeared in the market at that time. However, the biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party jumped out to speak for the speculators, saying, "Licenses can be issued to speculators, and they can be helped to transport goods." He hurriedly issued the black directive of "levying income tax on speculation," allowing speculators to exist legally. His agents in the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Administration immediately held meetings to formulate the "accumulation of illegal profits" taxation method, carefully considering for the speculators, leaving them a portion of the illegal profits to continue their speculative activities. This is a piece of evidence of the biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao taught us: "To maintain social order and the interests of the broad masses of the people, we must also practice dictatorship over those who steal, cheat, kill, arson, and various serious criminals who disrupt social order." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen market management, and thoroughly strike down all speculative activities to consolidate the socialist commercial front.

Opposing Chairman Mao's Foreign Trade Policy and Vigorously Promoting His "Red Buyer" Plan

The Chinese Khrushchev also attempted to make our country's socialist foreign trade "peacefully evolve." The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Foreign Trade exposed that in the early days of liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev resisted Chairman Mao's wise decision to immediately control foreign trade and reform the customs system, and jumped out to become the protector of the customs system as a tool for imperialist aggression. He issued a black directive saying, "Do not disturb the original setup of the customs, accept it as it is, and all rules and regulations are to be executed as before." This was a major exposure of his conspiracy to become a "red buyer" for imperialism. In 1956, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, after our country's socialist transformation achieved decisive victory, the biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party jumped out again, desperately maintaining his "red buyer" plan. In his twelve black directives to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, he completely erased the essential differences between socialist foreign trade and capitalist foreign trade; in the reform of foreign trading companies and old fake trading agencies, he adopted a policy of class surrender, openly advocating "letting capitalists exist and develop for several decades." He castrated Chairman Mao's policy of "restricting, utilizing, and transforming" capitalist industry and commerce, shouting "the main issue with private merchants is utilization," and saying, "For the reform of private import and export merchants, some of their signs can be left." He praised the comprador capitalists of import and export companies as "treasures," demanding that state-owned foreign trade departments absorb them in large quantities. He even went so far as to defend these running dogs, saying, "They can serve the British Jardine Matheson, so why can't they serve the motherland?" Chairman Mao taught us: "The comprador big bourgeoisie in China is a class that directly serves imperialism and is nurtured by them. Therefore, the comprador big bourgeoisie in China has always been the object of the revolution." The proletarian revolutionary fighters of the Ministry of Foreign Trade pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev openly opposed Chairman Mao, fully exposing that he is a thorough and thorough bourgeois representative in the Party.

Promoting "High Price" Policy and Sabotaging the Worker-Peasant Alliance

The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Food exposed a large number of facts, showing that the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices adopted a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in solving our country's food problem, which was to mechanize without revolutionizing. They took advantage of our country's temporary difficulties to spread a cold wind, advocating "twenty years of tension," advocating the development of rich peasant economy, opposing agricultural cooperativization, opposing the collectivization of rural people's communes and the revolutionization of peasants' ideology, advocating "chemical salvation," and "following the path of Japan and West Germany." The revolutionary fighters of the Ministry of Food pointed out that this counter-revolutionary revisionist line to solve our country's food problem directly opposed the revolutionary line of "revolution plus production can solve the food problem" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. The facts have proven that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the only correct way to solve our country's food problem, and the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev has completely failed, once again exposing his ugly face of opposing Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Food also exposed that during our country's temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated the reactionary policy of "choking the peasants' necks," saying, "Peasants are choking our necks in the food problem.... If peasants do not sell you agricultural products, you will not sell them salt to eat." He also vigorously advocated "industrial products sold to peasants can also be sold at high prices," to realize his repeatedly advocated reactionary commodity exchange policy of "high price for high price, low price for low price," in order to destroy our country's worker-peasant alliance, destroy the socialist economic foundation, and make the relationship between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants seriously opposed, paving the way for the restoration and development of capitalism.

In order to restore capitalism, the Chinese Khrushchev extended his black hand into the financial and banking departments, attempting to usurp the socialist direction of these key departments that hold the financial power of the state. He, together with another biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party, successively formulated two thoroughly revisionist regulations on financial work, which are clear evidence of his crimes. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Finance criticized this evil regulation. They pointed out: Chairman Mao taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "As long as we relax our ideological and political work a little, economic work and technical work will definitely go astray." However, the formulators of these two revisionist financial work regulations did not mention the real class struggle on the financial and banking front, did not mention the prominence of proletarian politics, but only emphasized "control," "restrict," "supervise," and "inspect," emphasizing the expert line, institutional supremacy, and profit supremacy. The biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party issued these two regulations that highlighted bourgeois politics in 1954 and 1962, precisely to cooperate with the sharp class struggle in society at that time, to serve his conspiracy to develop and restore capitalism. He also attempted to make the broad financial and banking cadres forget the overall policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, forget the fundamental principle that socialist finance and banking must serve proletarian politics, and lead the broad cadres to the wrong path of a single financial viewpoint that emphasizes business over politics and sees things but not people.

The proletarian revolutionaries of the People's Bank of China exposed a large number of facts, showing that the Chinese Khrushchev, through his agents in the bank, vigorously supported the development of capitalist forces in urban and rural loans, foreign exchange, and currency business, and restricted and sabotaged the socialist economy. He openly said: "Capitalist exploitation is legal, the more the better, dividends should be increased," and said, "...I think earning how much (dividends) is legal." He attempted to turn the state bank, which serves the dictatorship of the proletariat, into a criminal tool for their restoration of capitalism. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Finance also exposed that the Chinese Khrushchev, as early as the early days of liberation, emphasized "equal taxation for public and private," which was actually to support the private sector and suppress the public sector, which was another piece of evidence of his conspiracy to develop capitalism in China.

The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of the financial and commercial departments of the State Council have expressed that they will definitely hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen dog, politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrow and thoroughly expose the biggest capitalist-roadier in the Party, and fight him to the end. They will also closely link the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, thoroughly eliminating all the revisionist poison he has spread in the department.

　　国务院财贸部门革命派高举革命大批判的旗帜向资产阶级司令部发起猛攻
　　狠揭中国赫鲁晓夫在财贸系统复辟资本主义的滔天罪行
　　决心从政治、思想、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，紧密结合本单位斗批改，彻底肃清他的修正主义流毒
    本报讯　国务院财贸系统无产阶级革命派和革命职工，响应我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，集中火力，集中目标，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起猛烈进攻。国务院财贸系统革命造反联络委员会几次召集大会，系统地从政治上、思想上、理论上批判中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    攻击社会主义　鼓吹资本主义
    商业部和供销合作总社的无产阶级革命派战士们，愤怒地揭发了中国的赫鲁晓夫在党的七届二中全会之后，就抛出了一条同毛主席革命路线相对抗的、发展资本主义的反革命修正主义路线。他竭力抵制毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”这个经济工作的总方针，在商业工作上做了一系列黑指示，大力鼓吹资本主义的经营路线和经营方式，为商业资本家的所谓“进步性”大唱赞歌，公然要社会主义商业学习资本家唯利是图的生意经。一九五七年，中国赫鲁晓夫在同广东省委的一次关于商业工作的谈话中，还公然恶毒地攻击社会主义，为复辟资本主义制造舆论，说什么：“现在的办法说明资本主义比社会主义优越。我们的成本、劳动生产率、利润率都显得落后，不要迷信社会主义一定会比资本主义进步，做的结果，我们很多不如资本主义，这样社会主义就要灭亡。”他还说：“现在要向私商、小贩学，公司经理带头下乡买几个鸡，要负责人、党员干部做模范。”中国赫鲁晓夫发出这些胡言乱语，就是为了篡改社会主义商业的性质。一九五六年党对私营工商业的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利之后，他又迫不及待地叫嚷“要把资本家吸收进来，成立顾问团”，让他们“作顾问，作参谋”，听他们指挥，在我国商业系统中，建立了所谓“业务改进委员会”，让资本家去研究我国商业的计划和设置等“业务”问题，并让他们“检查”工作，提出“改进”意见。同时，要商业部门“向资本家学习，学习资本主义经营方式”，说“社会主义越搞越死”。“要大力推行赊销”“买一送一”等等，这样，可以“多赚钱”。一句话，在他的心目中只有一个字：“钱”。供销社的无产阶级革命派同志还揭露，中国的赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，还大肆鼓吹“合作主义”，说什么“富农加入消费社，当个消费者是可以的，地主、商人、资本家当个消费者也是可以的，要象社员一样推销他们的产品，供应物资给他们，分取红利。”企图把社会主义的供销事业变成资本主义的“合作社”。无产阶级革命派和革命群众激愤地指出：中国赫鲁晓夫把黑手伸进商业部门，企图改变社会主义商业的颜色，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在力图使社会主义商业“和平演变”的同时，大力鼓吹开放自由市场，说什么“看来自由市场搞大一点好，……自由市场对我们有利。”取消市场上的阶级斗争，让资本主义势力自由泛滥，这是他复辟资本主义的又一阴谋。中央工商行政管理局的无产阶级革命派战士揭发了大量事实，证明中国赫鲁晓夫是市场上投机倒把分子的庇护人。一九六二年秋，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，各地广大革命干部和群众热烈响应这个号召，对当时市场上出现的投机倒把分子进行了坚决的打击。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟然跳出来替投机倒把分子讲话，说什么“投机的人可以发照，替他运”。还急忙发出“对投机倒把要抽所得税”的黑指示，让投机倒把分子合法存在。他在财政部和中央工商行政管理局的代理人立即召开会议，制订了“积蓄暴利”的征税办法，替投机倒把分子设想得很周到，给他们留下一部分暴利以便继续从事投机倒把活动。这是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的一个罪证。毛主席教导我们：“为了维护社会秩序和广大人民的利益，对于那些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，加强市场管理，彻底打击一切投机倒把活动，巩固社会主义商业阵地。
    对抗毛主席的对外贸易政策大肆推行他的“红色买办”计划
    中国赫鲁晓夫还力图使我国社会主义的对外贸易“和平演变”。外贸部无产阶级革命派揭露，解放初期，中国赫鲁晓夫就抗拒毛主席关于立即统制对外贸易，改革海关制度的英明决策，公然跳出来要充当帝国主义侵华工具的海关制度的保护人。他发出黑指示说：“对海关不要打乱原来的摊子，原封不动地接受下来，一切规章制度也照旧执行。”这是他要给帝国主义充当“红色买办”阴谋的一次大暴露。一九五六年，在毛主席革命路线指引下，我国社会主义改造取得了决定性胜利之后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派又跳出来，拚命维护他的“红色买办”计划。他在给外贸部的十二点黑指示中，完全抹煞了社会主义对外贸易和资本主义对外贸易的本质区别；在对待洋行和旧伪贸易机构的改造上，更是采取阶级投降政策，公然主张“让资本家存在和发展几十年”。他阉割了毛主席规定的对资本主义工商业实行“限制、利用、改造”的政策，叫嚣“对私商主要是利用问题”，还说什么“对私营进出口商的改造，可以留一些挂他们的牌子。”他吹捧进出口商行的买办资本家是“宝贝”，要国营对外贸易部门大量吸收他们。甚至不惜为这些洋奴辩解说：“他们能为英国的怡和洋行服务，为什么不能为祖国服务？”毛主席教导我们：“中国的带买办性的大资产阶级，是直接为帝国主义服务并为它们所豢养的阶级。因此，中国的带买办性的大资产阶级历来都是革命的对象。”外贸部无产阶级革命派的战士们指出：中国赫鲁晓夫公开同毛主席唱反调，充分暴露了他是一个彻头彻尾的资产阶级在党内的代理人。
    鼓吹“高价”政策　破坏工农联盟
    粮食部无产阶级革命派揭露了大量事实，说明中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，在解决我国粮食问题上采取了一条只要机械化，不要革命化的反革命修正主义路线。他们利用我国的暂时困难，大刮阴风，鼓吹什么“二十年紧张论”，主张发展富农经济，反对农业合作化，反对农村人民公社化和农民的思想革命化，鼓吹“化学救国”，“走日本、西德的道路”。粮食部革命派的战士们指出，这条解决我国粮食问题的反革命修正主义路线，是同我们伟大的领袖毛主席提出的“革命加生产即能解决吃饭问题”的革命路线直接相对抗的。事实证明，毛主席的革命路线是解决我国粮食问题的唯一正确的道路，中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线已经彻底破产，又一次暴露了他反对毛主席的丑恶嘴脸。粮食部的无产阶级革命派还揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫在我国暂时困难时期，极力主张“卡农民脖子”的反动政策，说什么“农民在粮食问题上卡住我们的脖子，……农民不卖给你农产品，你就不卖给他盐吃。”还竭力主张“卖给农民的工业品，也可以高价出售”，以实现他一再鼓吹的“高价对高价、低价对低价”的反动的商品交换政策，以便破坏我国的工农联盟，破坏社会主义经济基础，使城乡关系、工农关系严重地对立起来，为复辟和发展资本主义铺平道路。
    为了复辟资本主义，中国赫鲁晓夫把他的黑手伸进了财政金融部门，妄图篡改这些掌握国家财政大权的要害部门的社会主义方向。他伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，先后两次炮制了两个彻头彻尾的修正主义的财政工作的规定，就是明显的罪证。财政部无产阶级革命派批判了这个罪恶的规定。他们指出：毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“只要我们的思想工作和政治工作稍为一放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。”而这两个修正主义的财政工作规定的炮制者，却根本不谈财政金融战线上现实的阶级斗争，不提突出无产阶级政治，只是一味地单纯强调“管”、“卡”、“督”、“查”，强调专家路线、制度挂帅和利润挂帅。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在一九五四年和一九六二年抛出这两个突出资产阶级政治的规定，正是为了配合当时社会上尖锐的阶级斗争，为他发展和复辟资本主义的阴谋服务的。他还企图使广大财政金融干部忘记毛主席亲自制定的“发展经济，保障供给”这个经济工作和财政工作的总方针，忘记社会主义财政金融必须服从无产阶级政治的根本原则，而把广大干部引向重业务轻政治、见物不见人的单纯财政观点的邪路上去。
    中国人民银行总行的无产阶级革命派揭发的大量事实，说明中国赫鲁晓夫通过他在银行的代理人，在城乡贷款、外汇、货币等项业务中，极力扶植资本主义势力发展，限制和破坏社会主义经济，他公然说：“资本主义剥削是合法的，愈多愈好，股息应该提高”，并说：“……我认为赚多少（股息）都合法。”妄图把为无产阶级专政服务的国家银行演变成为他们复辟资本主义的罪恶工具。财政部的无产阶级革命派也揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫早在解放初期就强调“公私同税”，实际上是扶私压公，这是他阴谋在中国发展资本主义的又一罪证。
    国务院财贸系统的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众纷纷表示，一定要高举革命大批判的旗帜，以痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，并且同本单位的斗批改密切结合起来，彻底肃清他在本部门散布的一切修正主义流毒。
