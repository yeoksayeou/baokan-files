Party Central Committee leaders issued a battle call at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee

	Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment
	Firmly Grasp the Direction of Revolutionary Struggle

	Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Yang Chengwu, and Zhang Chunqiao, representing the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, made extremely important speeches. Comrades Li Fuchun and Li Tianyou also attended the meeting. Comrade Xie Fuzhi presided over the meeting.

	The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is exceptionally good. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices. We must carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" and "grasp revolution, promote production." Students and other revolutionary masses who are traveling to other places should immediately return to their original units to make revolution. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance and prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from stirring up trouble and taking advantage of the chaos.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 2, 1967: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting on September 1. Central leaders made extremely important speeches at the meeting. This is a crucial moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao, issued an important battle call based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

	Central leaders attending the meeting included Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and other members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Comrades Yang Chengwu and Li Tianyou also attended the meeting.

	Comrade Xie Fuzhi, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, presided over the meeting.

	Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Yang Chengwu, and Zhang Chunqiao, representing the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, made important speeches.

	The central leaders unanimously pointed out that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is exceptionally good. The counter-revolutionary line led by the Chinese Khrushchev is on the verge of complete collapse, and the revolutionary movements in various places are advancing towards victory. Our current main task is: to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation, to concentrate firepower and targets, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, to criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and in the process of thorough criticism and repudiation, to further develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The central leaders called on the revolutionary masses to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and to further implement Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" and "grasp revolution, promote production." All students and other revolutionary masses who are traveling to other places should immediately return to their original regions and units to make revolution.

	The central leaders pointed out that all revolutionary masses must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from stirring up trouble and taking advantage of the chaos. They must resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and resolutely disband the "May 16 Corps," a counter-revolutionary organization manipulated by a handful of bad leaders.

	All comrades attending the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.
