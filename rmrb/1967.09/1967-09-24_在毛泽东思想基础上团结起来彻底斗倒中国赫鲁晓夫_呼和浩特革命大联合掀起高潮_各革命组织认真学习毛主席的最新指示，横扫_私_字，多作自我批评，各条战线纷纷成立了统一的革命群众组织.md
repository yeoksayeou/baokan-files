	Unite on the Basis of Mao Zedong Thought to Thoroughly Defeat the Chinese Khrushchev
	The Great Revolutionary Unity Wave Sweeps Across Hohhot
	All Revolutionary Organizations Seriously Study Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions, Sweep Away "Selfishness," and Engage in Self-Criticism; Revolutionary Mass Organizations Are Established Across All Fronts

	According to Xinhua News Agency Hohhot, September 23rd: The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached Hohhot City, and the proletarian revolutionary masses immediately studied them seriously and carried them out resolutely, sparking a new wave of revolutionary unity across the city. On September 18th, the headquarters of twelve revolutionary mass organizations in Hohhot's industrial and transportation sectors jointly established the preparatory committee for the workers' congress. Nearly 200 basic-level revolutionary mass organizations in factories and enterprises also achieved revolutionary unity. Out of the 56 colleges and universities and secondary schools in the city, 43 had already achieved revolutionary unity, and in the past two days, another five schools achieved revolutionary unity, with five more schools preparing to establish unified revolutionary mass organizations.

	In the great historical tide of revolutionary unity, the working class of Hohhot is at the forefront. They repeatedly study and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They study and apply Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's policy of unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in the process of revolutionary unity. Workers expressed: Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations had the idea that "our headquarters has more people, we rebelled against the capitalist-roaders within the party earlier, and unity should be based on us." After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they realized that precisely because of this, they should be more aware, have stronger proletarian party spirit, and promote revolutionary unity, achieving new merits. The strong desire of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the industrial and transportation sectors to achieve unity drove the unity of the headquarters of various revolutionary mass organizations, and after the headquarters achieved unity, they further promoted the revolutionary unity of basic-level revolutionary mass organizations.

	The proletarian revolutionary masses of Hohhot City believe that to achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity, the key is to listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, break away from selfishness, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and handle internal contradictions within the revolutionary ranks by engaging in self-criticism. The leaders of the two major revolutionary mass organizations of Hohhot First Normal School not only engaged in self-criticism at the leadership core meeting but also went to each other's groups to engage in self-criticism and listen to the opinions of the masses. On the evening of the 21st, the entire school formed a unified revolutionary mass organization. The revolutionary youngsters unanimously expressed: After achieving revolutionary unity, they will concentrate their firepower and targets to carry out a thorough criticism, improve the revolution's "three-in-one combination," and seize the complete victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来彻底斗倒中国赫鲁晓夫
　　呼和浩特革命大联合掀起高潮
    各革命组织认真学习毛主席的最新指示，横扫“私”字，多作自我批评，各条战线纷纷成立了统一的革命群众组织
    据新华社呼和浩特二十三日电　伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示传到呼和浩特市，无产阶级革命派立即认真学习，坚决照办，在全市掀起了革命大联合的新高潮。呼和浩特市工交系统的十二个革命群众组织的总部，在九月十八日联合成立了工代会筹备委员会，工厂企业的近二百个基层革命群众组织，也实现了革命的大联合。全市五十六个大专院校和中等学校，过去已经有四十三个实现了革命的大联合，最近两天，又有五个学校实现了革命大联合，另有五个学校准备成立全校统一的革命群众组织。
    在革命大联合的伟大历史潮流中，呼和浩特工人阶级走在最前面。他们反复学习领会毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”他们活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛主席团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方针，在革命大联合的过程中，碰到问题，就重温“老三篇”，破私立公。工人们表示：毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。有些革命群众组织的负责人，在大联合的过程中，曾经有“自己的总部人数多，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派造反早，联合应以我为主”的想法。他们学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，认识到正因为这样，就应该觉悟高，无产阶级党性强，作革命大联合的促进派，在革命大联合中立新功。工交系统无产阶级革命派要求实现大联合的强烈愿望，推动了各革命群众组织总部之间的大联合，各总部实现了革命大联合后，又促进了基层革命群众组织的革命大联合。
    呼和浩特市无产阶级革命派认为，要实现和巩固革命的大联合，关键是听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，破私立公，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，处理革命队伍内部的矛盾要多作自我批评。呼和浩特第一师范学校的两大派革命群众组织的负责人，不只在领导核心会上作自我批评，他们还互相到对方群众中间去作自我批评，听取群众意见，二十一日晚，全校组成了统一的革命群众组织。革命小将们一致表示：在实现革命大联合以后，集中火力，集中目标搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，促进革命的“三结合”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
