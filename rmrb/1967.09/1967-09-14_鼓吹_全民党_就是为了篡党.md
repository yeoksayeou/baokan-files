Title: Advocating for a "Mass Party" is Aimed at Usurping the Party

Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao says: “To make a revolution, a revolutionary party is needed. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the principles and in the style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs.”

Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and creatively put forward the theory, line, policy, and tasks of building a proletarian revolutionary party. Chairman Mao said, the Communist Party of China is the “vanguard of the Chinese proletariat” and should be built into “a disciplined party, a party armed with Marxism-Leninism, a party that practices self-criticism, and a party that is linked with the masses.”

The Chinese Khrushchev proposes a counter-revolutionary revisionist line on party building. He blathers on about how “the Chinese Party is the most intelligent and outstanding organization of men and women of the Chinese nation,” and “is the most advanced detachment of the Chinese people.” In a word, he denies the class nature of the party and negates that the Communist Party is the advanced detachment of the proletariat.

What he advocates here is nothing but the revival of the old revisionist Bernstein’s “people’s party,” a replica of Khrushchev’s “mass party.” The CPSU Program states: “With the victory of socialism in the USSR and the strengthening of the unity of Soviet society, the Communist Party of the working class has become the vanguard of the entire Soviet people and has become the party of all the people.” The CPSU Central Committee’s open letter states, “The CPSU has become a political organization of the entire people.”

Marxists-Leninists have long since refuted the “mass party” to the point of complete exposure. The founders of the international communist movement, Marx and Engels, stressed: “To oppose the proletarian nature of the party is to sell oneself out.” The great teacher Lenin pointed out: “The party should only be the vanguard and leader of the broad masses of the working class.” “The party, as the vanguard of the working class, must not be confused with the entire class.” Stalin said: “The party should first of all be the vanguard of the working class.” “The party is the highest form of organization of the proletariat. The party is the organized detachment of the working class.” The profound analyses and scientific judgments of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have exposed the fraud of the “mass party” so deeply and forcefully, and refuted it so thoroughly! It has given the Chinese Khrushchev a hard blow. The self-proclaimed “student of Marx and Lenin” in China is actually a great traitor to Marxism-Leninism, a great traitor to the interests of the proletarian party, and the advocacy of a supra-class “mass party” is a great exposure of his counter-revolutionary ugly face.

Let’s uncover the Chinese Khrushchev’s “mass party” gourd and see what poison he is selling?

The “mass party” advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev aims to change the color of the party, allowing class enemies to infiltrate the organs of proletarian dictatorship, burrow into the party’s liver, open up a breach from within, and realize the wolfish ambition of usurping the party and the state. As early as the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Khrushchev spared no effort to shield traitors, saying that surrendering was just “a formality,” “a momentary lapse,” and bringing a batch of big traitors into the party, promoting and using them. What is even more intolerable is that he even proposed that the party constitution should clearly stipulate: “Those who have surrendered and betrayed can also be elected as Central Committee members,” truly a scoundrel to the extreme! The Chinese Khrushchev’s shielding and using of traitors, on the one hand, is his need to usurp the party; on the other hand, it also shows that he himself is a despicable great traitor.

After national liberation, the reactionary theory of the Chinese Khrushchev’s “mass party” was further developed, and he further proposed that rich peasants can join the party, capitalists can join the party, blathering on about how party members who become rich peasants “still retain their party membership,” and “it’s not a problem if there are ten thousand rich peasant party members in the Northeast.” He even fawned over the vampire capitalists, boasting about how “capitalists have also joined,” and “it’s even better if they join the party.” He also shouted, “The party rules allow individual farming, allow hiring people, and not allowing exploitation is dogmatism.” What a wonderful scene! Exploiting on one side and joining the party on the other; holding “fixed interest” in one hand and paying party dues in the other, having the best of both worlds. This is the “mass party” advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev! This is a genuine bourgeois party!

Allowing the exploiting class to infiltrate the party of the working class is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The party constitution clearly stipulates, “The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat,” whose purpose is to “completely eliminate the system of exploitation in China” and “realize communism.” The exploiting class is the object of the working class’s revolution, how can enemies be treated as equals, shaking hands and making friends? If, as the biggest capitalist-roader in the party said, rich peasants, capitalists, and other exploiting classes can join the party, and party members lead the exploitation, wouldn’t the Communist Party of China become the party of rich peasants, the party of capitalists, the party of the exploiting class? There has never been a proletarian party’s “party rules” that allow party members to hire people and allow exploitation. Only the “party rules” of a bourgeois party allow party members to hire people and allow exploitation.

Now the Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown. His bourgeois agents planted in the party have also been exposed one by one. Let us rise up with a “thousand-catty club,” and politically, ideologically, and theoretically, completely overthrow and expose the tiny handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, so that they never rise again! Let the party and the state remain red forever!

Let the Chinese Khrushchev’s “mass party” nonsense go to hell!

### 鼓吹“全民党”就是为了篡党

    鼓吹“全民党”就是为了篡党 	人大三红　“浪滔天”纵队东辉战斗队
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    毛主席全面地、系统地、创造性地提出了建设无产阶级革命政党的理论、路线、方针和任务。毛主席说，中国共产党是“中国无产阶级的先锋队”，应当建设成为“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫提出一条不折不扣的反革命修正主义建党路线。他胡说什么：“中国党是中华民族最聪明的最优秀的男女组织起来的”，“是中国人民中最先进的部队”。一句话，他抹煞政党的阶级性，否定共产党是无产阶级的先进部队。
    他在这里所鼓吹的一套货色，正是老牌修正主义伯恩斯坦之流鼓吹的“人民党”的复活，是赫鲁晓夫宣称的“全民党”的翻版。苏共纲领说：“由于社会主义在苏联的胜利，由于苏维埃社会的一致的加强，工人阶级的共产党已经变成苏联人民的先锋队，成了全体人民的党”。苏共中央公开信说，“苏共已经成为全民政治组织”。
    对于“全民党”的破烂货，马列主义者早已将它批驳得体无完肤。国际共产主义运动奠基人马克思、恩格斯强调指出：“反对党的无产阶级性质”就是“自己出卖自己”。伟大的导师列宁指出：“党应当只是工人阶级广大群众的先进部队和领导者。”“绝对不能把作为工人阶级先进部队的党和整个阶级混为一谈。”斯大林说：“党首先应当是工人阶级的先进部队”。“党是无产阶级阶级组织的最高形式。党是工人阶级的有组织的部队”。马、恩、列、斯的精辟分析和科学论断，对“全民党”的欺人魔术揭露得何等深刻有力，批驳得多么淋漓尽致！它给了中国的赫鲁晓夫当头一棒。自称“要作马克思、列宁的学生”的中国的赫鲁晓夫，实际上是马列主义的大叛逆，是出卖工人阶级政党利益的大工贼，鼓吹超阶级的“全民党”是他反革命丑恶嘴脸的一次大暴露。
    揭开中国赫鲁晓夫“全民党”的鬼葫芦，看他卖的究竟是什么毒药？
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“全民党”，目的是改变党的颜色，让阶级敌人混入无产阶级专政的机构，钻进党的肝脏，从内部打开缺口，实现篡党、篡国的狼子野心。早在抗日战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫就千方百计地包庇叛徒，说什么自首只是“一种形式”，是“一念之差”，将一批大叛徒拉入党内，提拔重用。尤其不能容忍的是，他竟然提出要党章明文规定：“有自首变节行为的人，也可以选为中央委员”，真是混蛋透顶！中国的赫鲁晓夫如此包庇叛徒，重用叛徒，一方面是他篡党的需要；另一方面，也说明他自己就是一个可耻的大叛徒。
    全国解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”的反动理论更有所发挥，进一步地提出富农可以入党，资本家可以入党，胡说什么党员成为富农“仍保留党籍”，“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”。他甚至对吸血鬼资本家献媚取宠，叫嚣什么“资本家也当了”，“又入了党，则更好了”。他还叫嚷“党规党法上允许单干，允许雇人，不能剥削是教条主义”。好一幅绝妙的图景！一面剥削，一面入党；右手拿“定息”，左手交党费，两全其美。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“全民党”的货色！这是不折不扣的资产阶级政党！
    允许剥削阶级钻入工人阶级的政党内，这是对马列主义、毛泽东思想彻头彻尾的背叛。党章明确规定，“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队”，其目的是在中国“彻底消灭剥削制度”，“实现共产主义”。剥削阶级是工人阶级的革命对象，敌我之间怎能平起平坐，握手言欢呢？如果象党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所说的那样，富农、资本家等剥削阶级可以入党，党员带头剥削，中国共产党岂不成了富农的党、资本家的党、剥削阶级的党了吗？从来没有一个无产阶级政党的“党规党法”允许党员雇人，允许党员剥削。允许党员雇人，允许剥削的，只能是资产阶级政党的“党规党法”。
    现在中国赫鲁晓夫垮台了。他安插到党内的资产阶级代理人也一个个被揪了出来。让我们奋起“千钧棒”，从政治上、思想上、理论上将党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底批倒、斗臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！永保党和国家千秋万代永不变色！
    让中国赫鲁晓夫“全民党”的滥调见鬼去吧！
