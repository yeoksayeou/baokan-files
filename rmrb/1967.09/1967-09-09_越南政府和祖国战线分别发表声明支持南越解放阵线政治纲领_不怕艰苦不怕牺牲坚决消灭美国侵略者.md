	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 8th — The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government recently issued a statement expressing enthusiastic support and resolute backing for the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front.

	The statement said: "At present, U.S. imperialism is frantically intensifying its war of aggression in the South and is blatantly escalating its destructive war against the North to a highly dangerous level. Unprecedented fierce battles and unprecedented glorious victories are unfolding before the entire military and civilian population. At this moment, the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front has issued its political program. It inherits and develops the previous ten-point program, carries forward the victories already achieved, and will lead the people of the South to further seize even greater victories until final victory."

	The statement said: "The political program of the Front marks a new development in the patriotic struggle of the people of the South, setting forth the goals of struggle for all classes of people in the South: to defeat the American bandits and their lackeys, to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and to achieve national reunification in peace. This is the legitimate aspiration of the 14 million people of the South. The political program embodies the extremely wise and reasonable line and policies of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front in its struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. It is the banner of great national unity and an invincible weapon for the people of the South to defeat the American aggressors. The political program of the Front is a lofty and powerful expression of the iron will of South-North solidarity and national reunification."

	The statement said: "The political program of the Front more clearly embodies the role of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, the only true representative of the heroic people of South Vietnam who are defeating and will thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys."

	The statement concluded: "The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government and the people of the North enthusiastically welcome and resolutely support the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front. The 17 million military and civilian population of the North are determined to stand united at all times, shoulder to shoulder with our brothers and sisters in the South, to wage a courageous and tenacious struggle, fearing no hardship, fearing no sacrifice, to decisively defeat the American aggressors, to defend the North, to liberate the South, and to achieve national reunification in peace, thereby contributing to the defense of peace in Asia and the world."

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 8th — According to reports from local newspapers, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front held an extraordinary meeting on September 7th and issued a statement expressing resolute support for the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front.

	The statement said that the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, in its glorious August meeting, unanimously adopted the political program of the Front. This is a historic event of great significance.

	The statement pointed out that the political program of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, under the banner of great national unity and the banner of decisive victory, embodies the extremely wise and reasonable line of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front in its struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. It will form an invincible force, rallying, mobilizing, inspiring, organizing, and leading all the people of the South to advance victoriously, resolutely to annihilate the aggressors and the traitorous Vietnamese puppet clique, and to achieve a thorough victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.
