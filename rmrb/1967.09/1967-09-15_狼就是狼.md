		A Wolf Is Still a Wolf	Xia Wuyang

	Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hold that imperialism is the root cause of modern wars. It cannot survive without aggression and war.

	However, the Chinese Khrushchev goes against this principle. He absurdly claims that "the Americans don't particularly like war." This is sheer nonsense!

	Everyone knows that since the Second World War, American imperialism has never stopped its aggression and war. The heinous crimes it has committed against the people of the world are so numerous that "even if all the bamboo in the Southern Mountains were used to write them down, the crimes would still not be fully recorded; even if all the waves of the Eastern Sea were used to wash them away, the evil would still not be cleansed." It launched the criminal war of aggression against Korea and the inhuman war of aggression against Vietnam, sent troops to Lebanon, invaded Iraq, assassinated Lumumba, armed invasion of Cuba, armed intervention in the Dominican Republic, massacred the people of Panama, supported Israel's aggression against Arab countries... Can these actions be seen as evidence that American imperialism "doesn't particularly like war"?

	American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people, the butcher who massacres the Chinese people. Before liberation, which of the aggressions and enslavements the Chinese people suffered was not linked to American imperialism? It was this very same American imperialism that provided money and guns to arm the Kuomintang bandits, launching a nationwide civil war in China; it was this same American imperialism that, soon after the founding of the People's Republic of China, launched the war of aggression against Korea aimed at China, and occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan; it is this same American imperialism that is now hastening to arm the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, attempting to invade the mainland, while also personally dispatching aircraft and warships to repeatedly violate our airspace and territorial waters, madly provoking war; it is this same American imperialism that colludes with the Soviet revisionists, joining reactionaries from various countries to attempt to establish an encirclement of China... American imperialism has piled up a mountain of blood debts to the Chinese people, yet the Chinese Khrushchev is there, whitewashing the bloodthirsty American imperialism. Is this not a clear exposure of him as a complete traitor to the nation?

	Without aggression and war, imperialism cannot survive. Even the leaders of American imperialism do not hide their love for war. Kennedy once publicly roared, "Prepare for the final battle for our country (America), and mean it." His successor, Johnson, was even more frank, saying that the hope of achieving American goals "depends on the strength of our weapons." Here, the Chinese Khrushchev has been slapped in the face. Alas! A slave willing to serve American imperialism is "loyal but gets into trouble," how unjust!

	In fact, the Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense is not some "old revolutionary's" new discovery, but rather something he picked up from his fellow traitor, Khrushchev. Khrushchev once said, "The American president also does not want to start a war." It's as if they were cut from the same cloth.

	The Chinese Khrushchev's beautification of American imperialism is an attempt to lull the revolutionary people of the world into complacency. This fully exposes his traitorous face.

	However, no matter how hard the Chinese Khrushchev tries to beautify American imperialism, American imperialism will never become a gentle lamb. A wolf is still a wolf, imperialism is still imperialism. A wolf cannot change its nature of eating people, and American imperialism cannot change its nature of aggression. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher's knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their demise."

    狼就是狼	夏五洋
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想认为，帝国主义是现代战争的根源，它不进行侵略和发动战争，就活不下去。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之。他胡说什么“美国也不那么喜欢”战争。简直是睁眼说瞎话！
    大家知道，第二次世界大战以来，美帝国主义一刻也没有停止过进行侵略和发动战争。它对世界人民所犯下的滔天罪行，真是“罄南山之竹，书罪未穷；决东海之波，流恶难尽。”发动罪恶的侵朝战争和灭绝人性的侵越战争，出兵黎巴嫩，侵犯伊拉克，杀害卢蒙巴，武装入侵古巴，武装干涉多米尼加，屠杀巴拿马人民，支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家……这一切难道是美帝国主义“不那么喜欢”战争的表现吗？
    美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，是屠杀中国人民的刽子手。解放前，中国人民遭到的帝国主义的侵略和奴役，哪一件离开了美帝国主义？就是这个美帝，出钱出枪，武装蒋匪帮，在中国发动全国规模的内战；又是这个美帝，在中华人民共和国刚刚成立后不久，就发动了矛头指向中国的侵朝战争，并且侵占了我国神圣领土台湾；也是这个美帝，现在正加紧武装蒋介石残匪，妄图窜犯大陆，同时又亲自出动飞机、军舰，不断侵犯我国的领空领海，疯狂地进行战争挑衅；还是这个美帝，勾结苏修，联合各国反动派，妄图建立一个对中国的包围圈……。美帝国主义欠下中国人民的血债累累，而中国赫鲁晓夫却在那里为嗜血成性的美帝涂脂抹粉，岂不恰恰暴露了他是个十足的民族败类吗？
    离开了侵略和战争，帝国主义就不能生存。就连美帝国主义的头目们也不讳言自己是喜欢战争的。肯尼迪曾公开吼叫：“准备最终为我国（美国）而战，并且说到做到。”他的继承者约翰逊更加坦率地说，实现美国目标的希望“取决于我们的武器的力量”。在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫挨了一记响亮的耳光。呜呼！甘愿为美帝国主义效劳的奴才，反倒“忠而获咎”，岂不冤哉！
    其实，中国赫鲁晓夫的这句鬼话，并不是什么“老革命”的新发现，而是从难兄赫鲁晓夫那儿捡来的“牙慧”。赫鲁晓夫就说过“美国总统先生也不希望引起战争”。真是如出一辙。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之所以美化美帝国主义，就是妄图麻痹世界革命人民的斗志。这就充分暴露了他的叛徒嘴脸。
    但是，不管中国赫鲁晓夫怎样大卖气力地美化美帝国主义，美帝国主义也绝不会变成温良的羔羊。狼就是狼，帝国主义就是帝国主义。狼改变不了吃人的本性，美帝国主义改变不了侵略的本性。正如毛主席所指出的，“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
