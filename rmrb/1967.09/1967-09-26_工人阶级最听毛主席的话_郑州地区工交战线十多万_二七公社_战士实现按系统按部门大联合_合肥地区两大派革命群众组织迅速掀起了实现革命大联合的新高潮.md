The working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words. Over ten million "August 7th Commune" soldiers in the industrial and transportation sectors of the Zhengzhou region have achieved great unity by system and department.

A new wave of revolutionary great unity has quickly swept through the two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Hefei region.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 25th: Over ten million "August 7th Commune" soldiers in eleven industrial and transportation systems, including transportation, coal, metallurgy, electricity, postal services, urban construction, geology, textiles, machinery, light industry, and construction installation in the Zhengzhou region, have quickly achieved revolutionary great unity by system and department after studying the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary great unity of the working class has set an example for revolutionary great unity on other fronts.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres in the industrial and transportation systems of the Zhengzhou region are all revolutionary factions that have fought their way out from under the reactionary bourgeois line. Although they all belong to the "August 7th Commune" of Henan Province, due to differences in the timing of their rebellions and the size of their units, they have each established their own revolutionary mass organizations. These revolutionary mass organizations have fought side by side in the past, jointly waging a resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the reactionary bourgeois line. However, after the victory of the struggle, due to the instigation and sowing of discord by class enemies and the development of petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks, some organizations have engaged in "internal warfare."

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao has issued new instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The proletarian revolutionary cadres in the industrial and transportation systems of the Zhengzhou region have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a wave of revolutionary great unity. They said excitedly, "We, the working class, were all oppressed and exploited by landlords and capitalists in the old society; in the Cultural Revolution, we all suffered persecution from the reactionary bourgeois line; today we have a common battle task. Why should we split and engage in 'internal warfare'? Achieving revolutionary great unity is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must, with the spirit of 'seizing the day,' quickly achieve revolutionary great unity by system and department in the course of revolutionary criticism and struggle."

Many units' proletarian revolutionary cadres have, in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, overcome selfishness and established public-mindedness, using proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. During the preparation for achieving revolutionary great unity in the transportation system, there was a phenomenon of "contesting the core"; in the grassroots organizations of the machinery system, some were unwilling to yield, causing factionalism that affected revolutionary great unity. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recognizing that contesting factions, contesting the core, and unwillingness to yield are all manifestations of petty-bourgeois factionalism, which are harmful to the revolution. Thus, they actively leveled the factions, looked at each other's strengths, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. The proletarian revolutionary cadres in the textile system, through jointly denouncing and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Henan, further recognized the power of revolutionary great unity and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. They also expressed their determination to truly achieve revolutionary great unity in thought, to continuously consolidate and expand revolutionary great unity, and to win new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

Many grassroots revolutionary mass organizations in the industrial and transportation systems have, in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, actively examined and corrected past errors of contesting positions and factionalism, promoting revolutionary great unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 25th: Under the guidance of the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of the working class, proletarian revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards in the Hefei region of Anhui Province have quickly launched a new wave of revolutionary great unity. By the evening of the 24th, over 180 units had achieved revolutionary great unity. The broad revolutionary masses, with their actual actions of quickly achieving revolutionary great unity, welcomed the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

The two major revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in the Hefei region, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," recognized that the common enemy of the proletarian revolutionary cadres is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their agents in Anhui. The proletarian revolutionary cadres have no reason not to unite and jointly fight against the enemy. After the two revolutionary mass organizations in the Hefei region jointly held their first rally to support the army and love the people on September 12th, they jointly held a rally for the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations on September 18th. Many factories, offices, and schools' two factions of revolutionary masses immediately posted big-character posters proposing great unity or sat down together to discuss the issue of great unity. In some factories, while the leaders of the two factions at the factory level were still discussing the issue of unity, the grassroots workers of the two factions in the workshops had already quickly united by workgroup. The workers of the first workshop in the Hefei Steel Plant, due to the instigation of the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, had previously caused serious opposition. Recently, after studying the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, the two factions of workers first united. They also fought side by side on the day commemorating Chairman Mao's inspection of the factory nine years ago, smelting a furnace of "unity" steel, becoming one of the earliest units in the city to achieve revolutionary great unity for the two factions.

In the past two days, eight out of nine colleges and universities in Hefei City have achieved revolutionary great unity across the entire school. Previously, due to the instigation of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the sowing of discord by a few bad elements, the revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in these schools not only split into two factions but also engaged in unending "internal warfare." They have now quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. The revolutionary young warriors said excitedly: Now we are not this faction or that faction, but all belong to the Mao Zedong Thought faction. After achieving revolutionary great unity, many schools immediately jointly held revolutionary criticism columns.

    工人阶级最听毛主席的话
　　郑州地区工交战线十多万“二七公社”战士实现按系统按部门大联合
　　合肥地区两大派革命群众组织迅速掀起了实现革命大联合的新高潮
    新华社郑州二十五日电　郑州地区交通、煤炭、冶金、电业、邮电、城建、地质、纺织、机械、轻化工、建筑安装等十一个工交系统的十多万名“二七公社”的战士，学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，迅速地按系统、按部门实现了革命的大联合。工人阶级的革命大联合，为其他各条战线上的革命大联合，树立了榜样。
    郑州地区工业、交通系统的无产阶级革命派战士，都是从资产阶级反动路线下冲杀出来的革命派，他们虽然同属河南省“二七公社”，但由于造反时间的早晚不同，单位的大小不同，各自建立了自己的革命群众组织。这些革命群众组织，过去曾经并肩战斗，共同向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。但是，在斗争胜利后，由于阶级敌人的挑拨离间，加上革命队伍中小资产阶级派性的发展，一些组织之间打起了“内战”。
    最近，伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”郑州地区工交系统的无产阶级革命派坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了革命大联合的高潮。他们无限激动地说，我们工人阶级，在旧社会都受地主、资本家的压迫、剥削；在文化大革命中又都遭受资产阶级反动路线的迫害；今天我们有共同的战斗任务。我们有什么理由闹分裂，打“内战”？实现革命的大联合，是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，我们要以“只争朝夕”的精神，在革命大批判中，迅速实现按系统、按部门的革命大联合。
    许多单位的无产阶级革命派在实现革命大联合的过程中，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级的派性。交通系统在筹备实现革命大联合时，曾出现过“争核心”的现象；机械系统的基层组织中有的互不服气，闹山头主义，影响革命大联合。他们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，认识到争山头、争核心、互不服气，都是小资产阶级派性的表现，对革命有百害而无一利。于是，他们主动削平了山头，互相看优点，看长处，很快实现了革命的大联合。纺织系统的无产阶级革命派，通过一起声讨和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南代理人，进一步认识到革命大联合的威力，很快实现了革命的大联合，他们并且表示要从思想上真正做到革命的大联合，不断巩固和扩大革命的大联合，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。
    工交系统很多基层革命群众组织的负责人，在实现革命大联合中，主动检查过去争席位、闹派性的错误，促进了革命的大联合。
    新华社合肥二十五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示的指引下，安徽省合肥地区广大工人阶级、无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，迅速掀起革命大联合的新高潮。到二十四日晚上，实现了革命大联合的单位已有一百八十多个。广大革命群众以迅速实现革命大联合的实际行动，迎接伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    合肥地区两大派革命群众组织和广大革命群众，学习了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”他们认识到，无产阶级革命派的共同敌人是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在安徽的代理人，无产阶级革命派，没有任何理由不联合起来，共同对敌。合肥地区两大革命群众组织继九月十二日第一次联合召开拥军爱民大会以后，九月十八日又联合召开了两大革命群众组织各级负责人的团结大会。许多工厂、机关、学校两大派组织的革命群众立即贴出大字报，提出大联合的倡议，或者马上坐到一起研究大联合的问题，有的工厂当两派组织的厂一级的头头还在研究联合问题的时候，基层车间的两派工人已按班组很快地联合起来了。合肥钢厂第一车间的两派工人，由于党内走资本主义道路当权派的挑动，曾经造成严重的对立，最近学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，两派工人首先联合了起来，他们还在毛主席视察这个工厂的九周年纪念日那天并肩战斗，炼出了一炉“团结”钢，成为全市两大派组织实现革命大联合最早的单位之一。
    合肥市九所高等院校的两大派组织，两天来已有八所院校实现了全校范围的革命大联合。前一时期，这些学校的革命师生和红卫兵小将，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑动和少数坏人的挑拨离间，不仅分成两派，而且“内战”不停，最近都迅速实现了革命的大联合。革命小将们十分兴奋地说：现在我们不是这个派，那个派，都是毛泽东思想派啦。许多学校在实现了革命大联合之后，立即共同举办了革命大批判专栏。
