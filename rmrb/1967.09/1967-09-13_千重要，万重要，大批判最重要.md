Over the past year, we have followed the great strategic deployment and wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, striking directly at the headquarters of the bourgeoisie and exposing its ringleader—China's Khrushchev. This is a great victory for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

However, for a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party has used his position to gather all sorts of evil elements, concentrating them at the headquarters of the bourgeoisie. Through various channels, he has spread a whole set of revisionist theories. Have we thoroughly criticized and exposed these? No. Have we completely eliminated the entire set of revisionist systems he has implemented wherever possible? No.

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party is not a "dead tiger" but a living one, a wolf that wants to devour people. If the revolution stops here and does not deeply develop the great criticism, the fruits of the revolution will be in vain. Therefore, we must launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, mobilizing hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to expose, criticize, and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, to politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose him, making him infamous for eternity and ensuring he never rises again. Launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism means cleansing all the filth of the old world represented by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, thoroughly destroying the base of revisionism, and building a bright red world of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the great historical mission bestowed upon us in the Mao Zedong era.

Currently, whether or not to carry out revolutionary criticism is a matter of loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a matter of loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Without criticizing the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and stray from the direction of the struggle.

Above all, it is most important to carry out revolutionary criticism.

Let us, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, concentrate our firepower and targets, further deeply and widely criticize, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and make new contributions to thoroughly smashing the headquarters of the bourgeoisie!

    千重要，万重要，大批判最重要
    一年多来，我们按照伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署和英明领导，直捣资产阶级司令部，揪出了它的总头目——中国的赫鲁晓夫，这是中国革命和世界革命的重大胜利。
    但是，长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派利用他窃踞的地位，网罗牛鬼蛇神，聚集于资产阶级司令部，通过各个渠道，散布了一整套修正主义的理论都批深批透了没有呢？没有。他在一切力所能及的地方所推行的一整套修正主义制度都彻底清除了没有呢？没有。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派决不是“死老虎”，还是活老虎，是要吃人的豺狼。如果革命就此止步，不深入开展革命的大批判，革命的成果必将废于一旦。因此，掀起革命的大批判的新高潮，就是发动亿万革命群众，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派开展大揭发、大批判、大斗争，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他批倒、批臭，让他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。掀起革命的大批判的新高潮，就是要荡涤党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的旧世界一切污泥浊水，彻底地摧毁修正主义的基地，建立起一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。这是毛泽东时代赋予我们的伟大的历史使命。
    当前，搞不搞革命的大批判，是忠不忠于毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的问题，是忠不忠于无产阶级革命事业的问题。脱离了对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，就违背了毛泽东思想，脱离了斗争大方向。
    千重要，万重要，开展革命的大批判最重要。
    让我们同全国的无产阶级革命派一道，集中火力，集中目标，进一步深入地、广泛地从政治上、思想上、理论上，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，开展革命的大批判，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部作出我们的新贡献！		  （南开大学《卫东》）
