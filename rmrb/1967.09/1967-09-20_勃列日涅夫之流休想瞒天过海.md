The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to fully restore capitalism domestically, has turned Soviet education into an important tool for instilling revisionist ideology in the younger generation, poisoning and corrupting Soviet youth. In Soviet schools, various scandals and juvenile delinquency incidents are rampant. These phenomena cannot but arouse the serious discontent of the broad masses of the Soviet people.

However, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, *Pravda*, has come out to defend itself, saying: "In our country, criminal phenomena are not the result of the state system and social nature," but are due to "low cultural level," because "we have not exerted all our efforts to educate the youth." This is truly absurd!

Everyone clearly remembers that it was this very *Pravda* that shouted at the top of its lungs about how "Soviet culture" had reached its "zenith." Now, it is this very *Pravda* that suddenly makes a U-turn, saying that the increase in juvenile delinquency in the Soviet Union is due to a "low cultural level." This is truly a case of slapping oneself in the face!

To say that juvenile delinquency is due to a "low cultural level" is sheer sophistry. Everyone knows that the educational level of the American people is not low, but the phenomenon of juvenile delinquency in the United States is precisely very serious. Obviously, the problem is not one of high or low cultural level, but of the capitalist system.

As Lenin pointed out: "The capitalist system is the root of all evil." Today's Soviet Union, where juvenile delinquency is on the rise, is precisely the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist clique's full-scale restoration of capitalism.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is trying to blame the cause of crime on a "low cultural level" in order to cover up the essence of the problem and deceive the Soviet people. In essence, they are most afraid of linking the cause of crime to the social system, because once this is done, once it is analyzed and pursued, it will inevitably lead to them, and it will necessarily arouse people to rebel and overthrow their rule.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and to a certain political line." The question is not one of how much education there is, but of which class the education serves, what kind of content the education has, and which class's successors it cultivates. The gentlemen of *Pravda* say that they have not "exerted all their efforts to educate the youth," and thus have caused juvenile delinquency in the Soviet Union. This is simply lying through one's teeth.

Have you really not "exerted all your efforts" to educate Soviet youth? Not at all.

Your newspapers peddle revisionist wares every day, spreading reactionary bourgeois ideology and the decadent lifestyle of the Western bourgeoisie; your stages perform tales of talented scholars and beautiful women, and dance the twist; your radio broadcasts decadent and degenerate jazz music; three-quarters of the movie theaters in your capital, Moscow, screen American films; your bookstores are filled with works that reek of bourgeois filth and low taste; isn't all this "propaganda" and "education" for youth? You do this to poison youth, as needed for your full-scale restoration of capitalism and revisionist rule.

It is clear that even your newspapers have to admit that Soviet youth are increasingly influenced by bourgeois ideology. It is precisely under the long-term poisoning of the Soviet revisionist leaders that Soviet youth have taken to the path of crime.

The Brezhnev clique has committed unforgivable crimes against the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist leadership cannot deceive heaven and earth!

    勃列日涅夫之流休想瞒天过海	程鹏  风雷
    苏修领导集团为了在国内全面复辟资本主义，把苏联的教育变成了向青年一代灌输修正主义思想的重要工具，毒害和腐蚀苏联青年。在苏联的学校里，各种丑事和青少年犯罪事件层出不穷。这些现象不能不引起广大苏联人民的严重不满。
    但是，苏修集团的喉舌《消息报》却跑出来辩解说：“在我国，犯罪现象不是国家制度和社会性质所引起的后果”，而是“文化水平低”，“因为我们远远没尽一切力量对青少年进行教育”造成的。
    这真可谓奇谈怪论！
    人们都清楚地记得，正是这个《消息报》声嘶力竭地吹嘘“苏联文化”已经到了“全盛时期”。现在，又是这个《消息报》突然来了个大转弯，却说苏联青少年犯罪多是由于“文化水平低”。真是自己打自己耳光！
    说青少年犯罪多是由于“文化水平低”，完全是诡辩。谁都知道，美国的国民教育水平并不低，但是美国青少年犯罪的现象恰恰是极其严重的。显然，问题不在文化水平高低，而在于资本主义制度。
    正如列宁所指出：“资本主义制度是一切罪恶的根源。”今日之苏联，青少年犯罪现象日益增多，正是苏修集团全面复辟资本主义的必然结果。
    苏修统治集团竭力想把犯罪的原因归咎于“文化水平低”，是为了要掩盖问题的实质，借以欺骗苏联人民。说穿了，他们最害怕把犯罪原因同社会制度联系起来，因为这样一联系，一分析，一追究，势必追到他们头上，势必要唤起人们起来造反，推翻他们的统治。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”问题不在于教育多少，而在于教育为那个阶级服务，教育的内容是什么性质的，培养那个阶级的接班人。《消息报》的先生们说什么“没尽一切力量对青少年进行教育”，因而造成苏联青少年犯罪。这简直是瞪着两眼说瞎话。
    你们真的“没尽一切力量”对苏联青少年进行教育吗？根本不是。
    你们的报刊，天天贩卖修正主义黑货，宣扬反动的资产阶级思想和糜烂不堪的西方资产阶级生活方式；你们的舞台上，演的是才子佳人，跳的是摇摆舞；你们的电台，广播腐朽颓废的爵士音乐；你们首都莫斯科三分之二的电影院，放映着美国电影；你们的书店里，摆满着散发资产阶级臭气的低级趣味的“作品”；难道这些不是对青少年进行“宣传”“教育”？你们这样做，就是为了毒害青少年，为你们全面复辟资本主义和修正主义统治所需要的。
    很清楚，就连你们的报刊也不得不承认，苏联青少年受资产阶级思想影响越来越严重。正是在苏修头子们的长期毒害下，苏联青少年走上了犯罪的道路。
    勃列日涅夫之流对苏联人民犯下了不可饶恕的滔天罪行。苏修领导集团休想瞒天过海！
