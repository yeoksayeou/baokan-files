	With Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline and the great revolutionary criticism as the motive force, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary workers in the capital's transportation system have launched a new high tide of studying, criticizing, uniting, and producing. Through the intensive study of Chairman Mao's works, they have promoted revolutionary criticism; through revolutionary criticism, they have achieved revolutionary unity within the system; and revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity have, in turn, vigorously promoted production, exceeding the various transportation tasks.

	Intensive Study Promotes Revolutionary Criticism

	The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary workers in the five companies and fifty-eight units under the Beijing Municipal Transportation Bureau, with the help of the PLA comrades, have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first position, further mastering Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful theoretical weapon, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism.

	The revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company, the Beijing Municipal Bus Company, the Repair Company, and other enterprises have studied Chairman Mao's works such as "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have universally combined the class struggle situation in their units and the issues in criticism to discuss. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "concentrating absolutely superior forces in each battle" and "dealing the enemy a crushing blow," they have determined the focus of criticism for each period and used Mao Zedong Thought as a microscope to organize large-scale criticism of the key issues of the counter-revolutionary revisionists. For example, using Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, they criticized the "exploitation merits" and the theory of the extinction of class struggle by the Chinese Khrushchev; using Chairman Mao's statements on politics being the commander and the soul, they criticized the material incentives and bonus system advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and so on. Because the targets were clear, the preparations were adequate, and the firepower was concentrated, their level of struggle continued to improve. There was exposure, struggle, criticism, and analysis, turning the criticism meeting into a battlefield for smashing bourgeois ideology and a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	To exchange experiences in the great criticism of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, cultivate and temper the activists of studying Chairman Mao's works, and continuously strengthen and develop the active forces of the great revolutionary criticism, the Beijing Municipal Transportation System has also held many lectures on the use of Chairman Mao's works by unit, by company, and by system to solve the problems in the current struggle.

	Achieving Revolutionary Unity in the Great Criticism

	In the great revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Beijing Municipal Transportation System have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, achieved and developed revolutionary unity on the basis of unity against the enemy. The revolutionary organizations of the Tram Company started from class education, held denunciation meetings and criticism meetings, guiding the broad revolutionary workers to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, making everyone realize that the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev is the root cause of the ideological estrangement and emotional opposition among the workers. Some deceived masses quickly awakened and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some warriors of the revolutionary organizations also clearly realized that the workers who were persecuted and deceived were all victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. In this way, opposition and estrangement were gradually eliminated, greatly promoting the unity of the workers and laying the ideological foundation for achieving revolutionary unity.

	How to correctly treat other revolutionary organizations is an important issue in achieving revolutionary unity. The "Rebellion Line" of the Automobile Repair Factory of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company had once united with the conservative organization to create friction with the revolutionary factions. Through the great criticism, the members of this organization awakened and expressed their determination to firmly support the revolutionary organization Red Rebel Corps. However, some warriors of the Red Rebel Corps advocated "absorbing" this organization. Regarding this issue, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must also be good at uniting those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." Everyone examined the erroneous thoughts of sectarianism and "only I am revolutionary," adhering to the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, actively seeking the other party to negotiate, and uniting to join the battle of great criticism.

	Selfishness is the great enemy in the thoughts of revolutionary unity. Only by breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, putting public interests first, can revolutionary unity be achieved and consolidated. The revolutionary faction of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Bureau once united with the revolutionary organizations of the five companies to seize the power from the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road from the bottom up. However, with the change of status, some comrades in the revolutionary faction of the municipal bureau had disagreements with the revolutionary worker representatives of the grassroots organizations on the issue of who should be the core group leader, and they fought for dozens of days of "internal war," causing losses to the revolution and production in the system. Later, with the help of the PLA comrades, the revolutionary faction of the bureau carried out rectification, examined selfishness, and corrected their understanding. Both sides also eliminated estrangement through self-criticism and achieved revolutionary unity again, establishing a revolutionary "three-in-one" preparatory group.

	Great Criticism and Great Unity Promote Production

	The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Beijing Municipal Transportation System, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have become models of seizing the revolution and promoting production, using the revolution to lead production, making the passenger and freight volume and the profit remittance plan of the whole city significantly increase compared to the same period last year.

	In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road in the Tram and Bus Companies were not willing to admit their defeat and had once instigated a part of the deceived masses to deliberately set up obstacles in production. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat bravely took on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production, ensuring timely departures and quickly establishing a new revolutionary order.

	To strive for the deceived masses and the cadres who made mistakes to do a good job in production, the Red Rebel Sub-branch of the Fourth Transportation Yard combined the great revolutionary criticism with production activities, extensively carried out heart-to-heart mutual assistance activities, and actively and patiently did in-depth and detailed ideological and political work for them. They successively absorbed more than a thousand people to join the revolutionary organization and achieved revolutionary unity throughout the yard. Originally, some people, due to different viewpoints, did not cooperate in production, affecting the unified command of production. Through great criticism and great unity, everyone actively did a good job in production cooperation, voluntarily obeyed and maintained the new order of revolution and production, solved some problems that had not been solved for a long time, and vigorously promoted the development of production.

　　以毛泽东思想为指针  以革命大批判为动力
　　首都交通运输系统实现革命大联合
　　广大革命职工勇挑革命和生产两副重担，做到按时出车，超额完成了各项交通运输任务
    本报讯　北京市交通运输系统无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，掀起了大学习、大批判、大联合、大生产的新高潮。通过大学毛主席著作，推动了革命的大批判；通过革命的大批判，实现了本系统的革命大联合；革命的大批判和革命的大联合又有力地促进了生产，超额完成了各项交通运输任务。
    大学习推动革命的大批判
    北京市交通运输局所属人民汽车、首都汽车、电车、运输、修理等五个公司、五十八个单位的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在解放军同志帮助下，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在第一位，进一步掌握毛泽东思想这一强大的理论武器，深入开展革命的大批判。
    北京市运输公司、人民汽车公司、修理公司等企业的革命群众组织，学习了毛主席的《目前形势和我们的任务》、《将革命进行到底》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等著作和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示以后，普遍结合本单位的阶级斗争形势和大批判中的问题进行讨论。他们根据毛主席关于“每战集中绝对优势兵力”、“给敌以歼灭性打击”的教导，确定每个时期的批判中心，并用毛泽东思想为显微镜，针对反革命修正主义分子的要害问题，组织大批判。例如，以毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的理论，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”；以毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂的论述，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的物质刺激、奖金挂帅，等等。由于目标明确，准备充分，火力集中，他们的斗争水平不断提高，有揭发，有斗争，有批判，有分析，把批判会变成大破资产阶级思想的战场，变成活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    为了交流大批判中活学活用毛主席著作的经验，培养和锻炼学习毛主席著作积极分子，不断壮大和发展革命大批判的积极分子队伍，北京市交通运输系统还多次按单位、按公司、按系统举办毛主席著作讲用会，解决当前斗争中的问题。
    在大批判中实现革命大联合
    在革命的大批判中，北京市交通运输系统的无产阶级革命派，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，在团结对敌的基础上，巩固和发展革命的大联合。电车公司的革命组织，从阶级教育入手，开控诉会、批判会，引导广大革命职工揭发和批判资产阶级反动路线，使大家认清中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线，是造成职工之间思想隔阂、感情对立的总根子。一些受蒙蔽的群众很快觉悟过来，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。一些革命组织的战士也清楚认识到：受迫害的和受蒙蔽的职工，都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。这样，就逐步消除了对立和隔阂，大大促进了职工的团结，为实现革命大联合打下了思想基础。
    如何正确地对待其他革命组织，是实现革命大联合的重要问题。北京市运输公司汽车修理厂的“造反战线”，过去曾一度和保守组织联合起来，与革命派闹磨擦。通过大批判，这个组织的成员觉醒过来，表示要坚决支持革命组织红色造反团。但是，红色造反团中有的战士却主张“吃”掉这个组织。针对这个问题，他们重温毛主席的教导：“还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”。大家检查了山头主义和“唯我革命”的错误思想，本着求大同、存小异的精神，主动找对方协商，联合起来投入大批判的战斗。
    私字是革命大联合中思想上的大敌。只有破私立公，打倒私字，公字当头，才能实现和巩固革命的大联合。北京市交通运输局机关革命派，曾经联合所属五个公司的革命组织，自下而上地夺了交通运输局党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。但是，随着地位的变化，市局机关革命派的少数同志，与基层组织的革命职工代表，在该谁当核心组长的问题上发生了分歧，并打了几十天的“内战”，给本系统的革命和生产造成了损失。后来，在解放军同志帮助下，机关革命派进行了整风，检查了私字，端正了认识。双方还通过自我批评，消除了隔阂，重新实现了革命的大联合，成立了革命的“三结合”筹备小组。
　　大批判、大联合推动了生产
    北京市交通运输系统的无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席的教导，做抓革命、促生产的模范，以革命统帅生产，使全市客运量、货运量和利润上缴计划，都比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，电车、汽车公司的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不甘心自己的失败，曾经挑动一部分受蒙蔽的群众，故意在生产中设置障碍。无产阶级革命派勇敢挑起革命、生产两副重担，保证按时出车，迅速建立起革命的新秩序。
    为争取受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部搞好生产，运输四场的红色造反分部，结合革命的大批判，在生产活动中广泛开展谈心互助活动，积极耐心地向他们做深入细致的思想政治工作，先后吸收一千多人参加了革命组织，在全场实现了革命的大联合。原来有些人由于观点不同，在生产上不合作，影响生产的统一指挥，通过大批判、大联合，大家都主动搞好生产协作，自觉遵守和维护革命和生产的新秩序，解决了一些过去长期解决不了的问题，有力地推动了生产的发展。
