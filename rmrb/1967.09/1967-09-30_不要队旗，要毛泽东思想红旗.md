The Tianjin City Thrift Cap Factory Revolutionary Rebel Group has been established for a long time. They have neither made a team flag nor armbands, and they do not even have an office.

At a meeting, some comrades suggested making a team flag as a symbol of their organization, to look impressive when going out. The majority of the comrades did not agree with this proposal. They believed:

Whether a mass organization is revolutionary or not is not determined by whether it has a flag, but by whether it holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and stands on the side of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. Someone said, "Making a team flag won't make us poor. We are making a revolution, so why be so stingy?" The leader of the rebel group recited a passage from Chairman Mao's teachings to everyone: "Run factories, shops, and all state and cooperative enterprises thriftily, and run all other undertakings thriftily. Everything should be done according to the principle of thrift." He continued, "Although we do not have a team flag, as long as we firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and hold it high, unshakably carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we can criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end." An old worker also spoke from the heart:

"Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have always fought hard in our revolution, and we have overthrown the three major mountains and achieved great victories in socialist construction. Our factory is called the Thrift Cap Factory, and we must never forget Chairman Mao's teaching of 'building the country through thrift.' Now, in carrying out the Cultural Revolution, we should even more vigorously promote the spirit of thrift and revolution, and we must not 'go astray'!"

One after another, everyone used Chairman Mao's teachings to unify their understanding. Although they did not make a team flag, the ideological awareness of each team member has been raised a step higher.

### 不要队旗，要毛泽东思想红旗

    不要队旗，要毛泽东思想红旗
    天津市勤俭制帽厂捍卫毛泽东思想造反队成立好久了，一没做队旗，二没做袖章，甚至连个办公室都没有。
    在一次会议上，有的同志提议做面队旗，作为自己组织的标志，打出去也显得威风。大多数同志不同意这个建议。他们认为：
  一个群众组织是不是革命的，不是看有没有旗子，而是看它是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。有人说：“做一面队旗，也穷不了，我们这是闹革命，何必这样小里小气的。”造反队的负责人就给大家背诵了一段毛主席语录：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。”他接着说：“我们虽然没有队旗，但是，只要我们在思想上把毛泽东思想伟大红旗扎得牢牢的，举得高高的，坚定不移地执行毛主席的革命路线，就能把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”一位老工人也深有感触地说：
  “毛主席领导我们闹革命，从来都是艰苦奋斗，照样推翻了三座大山，取得了社会主义建设的伟大胜利。我们厂叫勤俭制帽厂，就是要永远不忘毛主席‘勤俭建国’的教导。现在搞无产阶级文化大革命，更应该发扬节约闹革命的精神，可不要‘走线’啊！”
    你一言，我一语，用毛主席的教导统一了大家的认识。队旗虽然没有做，每个队员的思想认识却提高了一步。
