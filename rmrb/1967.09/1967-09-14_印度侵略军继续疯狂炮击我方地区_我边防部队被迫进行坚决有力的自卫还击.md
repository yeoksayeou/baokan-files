Indian aggressors stationed along the China-Sikkim border have continued to madly shell our side of the border at Nai Dala, Xie Pa Si, and Chun Pu Tang since around 4 AM today. They have extended their artillery fire to the depths of the Gawu Temple area, causing damage to local residents and property. Our Tibet border defense forces have been forced to carry out resolute and powerful counterattacks in self-defense.

Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the Indian reactionaries have been escalating serious military provocations against us along the China-Sikkim border. This has been strongly condemned by the Chinese people and will certainly be strongly opposed by the people of the world, including the people of India and Sikkim. The Indian reactionary government, in order to deceive the people of the world, has hypocritically "proposed" a ceasefire on the 13th, specifying that it would take effect at 5:30 AM Indian time. This is nothing but a lie. Even before the so-called ceasefire time proposed by the Indian reactionary government, they ordered their artillery to concentrate firepower and madly shell our frontline and deep areas, continuing until 8 PM tonight without stopping. The Indian reactionaries' aggression and military provocations against our country must be immediately stopped; otherwise, the Chinese people and the people of the world will not let you off.

    印度侵略军继续疯狂炮击我方地区
    我边防部队被迫进行坚决有力的自卫还击
    新华社拉萨十三日电　据我西藏边防部队报告：盘踞在中锡边境的印度侵略军，从今天凌晨四时许，又继续用重炮向中锡边界我侧的乃堆拉和斜帕司、春丕塘等地炮击，并疯狂地把炮火延伸到我嘎觉寺附近纵深地区，使我当地居民和财产受到损失。我西藏边防部队被迫进行了坚决有力的自卫还击。
    在美帝、苏修的阴谋策动下，印度反动派在中锡边境对我加紧进行严重的军事挑衅，受到了中国人民的强烈谴责，也一定会受到世界人民包括印度和锡金人民的强烈反对。印度反动政府为了欺骗世界人民，装模作样地“建议”在十三日“双方停火”，并具体规定于印度时间五时三十分起“生效”。这完全是骗人的鬼话。就在印度反动政府提出的所谓停火时间以前，却命令它的炮兵更加集中火力向我前沿和纵深地区疯狂炮击，直到今晚八时仍未停止。印度反动派对我国的侵略和军事挑衅，必须立即停止，否则，中国人民和世界人民是决不会饶过你们的。
