Dear Comrade Ly Quoc Vong, Comrade Nguyen Huu Huan, Comrade Nguyen Van Dan, and dear comrades and friends:

In the midst of the great victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, the delegation of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic led by Comrade Ly Quoc Vong and Comrade Nguyen Huu Huan, and the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam led by Comrade Nguyen Van Dan, have come to our country for a friendly visit and to participate in the celebrations of the 18th anniversary of the founding of our country. We are greatly delighted. You have brought to the Chinese people the fraternal fighting friendship of the entire Vietnamese people, which is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest welcome and heartfelt thanks to the heroic Vietnamese people's representatives from the front lines of the anti-American war. We also express our highest respect to the heroic Vietnamese people through you.

Over the past few years, the heroic Vietnamese people have, in their anti-American national salvation war, united as one, fought against the enemy with indomitable spirit, and creatively unleashed the immense power of people's war. They have repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, creating an unprecedentedly favorable situation. The people of South Vietnam have annihilated a large number of the enemy's forces, turning vast liberated areas into unshakable revolutionary bases, and putting more than a million American and puppet troops in a passive and defensive position. The people of North Vietnam have annihilated a large number of American air pirates, shooting down more than 2,300 enemy planes, providing powerful support to their compatriots in the south. The Chinese people rejoice in and take pride in every victory achieved by the Vietnamese people.

The heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated by bombs nor deceived by cunning words. Last July, Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a stirring call. Recently, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam published its political program, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared, "The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is not a single American aggressor on our beloved land." Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho also clearly stated, "We will continue to intensify our sacred war of national salvation against the Americans until not a single American aggressor remains in our beloved South Vietnam." These just declarations fully express the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to carry the anti-American national salvation war to the end. We believe that, with the spirit of fighting to the end and winning, the Vietnamese people will, with renewed efforts and perseverance, certainly defeat the American aggressors thoroughly and achieve final victory.

The victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation war have not only set a great example of daring to fight and daring to win for all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, but also created a brilliant example of a country using the strategy and tactics of people's war to single-handedly resist and defeat American imperialist aggression after World War II. The victories of the Vietnamese people have disrupted the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism, supported the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and made extremely valuable contributions to the common struggle of all peoples in the world against American imperialism.

At present, American imperialism is intensifying its military adventures and continuing to play the "peace talks" trick. The Soviet revisionist leadership has been actively collaborating, running errands for the American imperialists' "peace talks" trick. Recently, the Americans and Soviets are plotting a new "bombing halt and peace talks" deception, attempting to use the United Nations to intervene in the Vietnamese question. The Vietnamese government has already issued a statement, firmly opposing United Nations intervention. We have always maintained that the Vietnamese question has nothing to do with the United Nations, the United Nations has no right to meddle in the Vietnamese question, and the Vietnamese question can only be resolved in accordance with the four-point proposal of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Any attempt to use the United Nations to betray the sacred cause of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war will be firmly opposed by the Vietnamese people, firmly opposed by the Chinese people, and will not be tolerated by the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Comrades and friends, at present, our country is also facing a great revolutionary situation. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has already achieved great victories. The people of the whole country are now high-spiritedly holding aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launching a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. We will criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our country will be more consolidated and stronger than ever before. We will better implement Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "being prepared for war, being prepared for famine, and serving the people," more powerfully carry out our country's general line of foreign policy, and more effectively support the anti-American national salvation war of our fraternal Vietnamese people and the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

Imperialism and modern revisionism are terrified by our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are joining forces to launch a new wave of anti-China hysteria. But they will not be able to save themselves from their inevitable doom. They are but a handful and do not represent the will of the vast majority of the people in their countries. They are paper tigers and have no real power. The more they oppose China, the more they prove the invincible might of Mao Zedong Thought and the closer they are to their own doom.

China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other. The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are close comrades and brothers. American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of China and Vietnam. Your struggle is our struggle, your difficulties are our difficulties, and your victories are our victories. The Chinese people have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, and firmly providing China as a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people. No matter how frantically American imperialism expands the war, the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will unswervingly fight side by side with the Vietnamese people until the final victory of the anti-American national salvation war is achieved.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war,
To the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China,
To the indestructible fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam,
To the health of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh,
To the health of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam,
To the health of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong,
To the health of Comrade Ly Quoc Vong, Comrade Nguyen Huu Huan, and Comrade Nguyen Van Dan,
To the health of the envoys and their spouses present,
To the health of the comrades and friends present,

Cheers!

    周总理在欢迎越南党政代表团和南越民族解放阵线代表团宴会上讲话
　　中国人民遵循毛主席教导坚决支持越南抗美救国战争
　　美帝苏修阴谋通过联合国出卖越南人民抗美救国神圣事业，越南人民和中国人民坚决反对，世界革命人民也不会通过亲爱的黎清毅同志、黄文欢同志，亲爱的黄文旦团长，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，在越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争取得节节胜利的时候，由黎清毅同志和黄文欢同志率领的越南民主共和国党政代表团和以黄文旦团长为首的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团，来到我国进行友好访问，并且参加我国国庆十八周年的庆祝活动，我们感到无限兴奋。你们给中国人民带来了全越南人民的兄弟般的战斗友谊，这是对中国人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，对来自抗美战争前线的英雄的越南人民的代表，表示最热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢，并且通过你们向英雄的越南人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    几年来，英雄的越南人民在抗美救国战争中，南北一心，同仇敌忾，创造性地发挥了人民战争的无比威力，一次又一次地给敌人以重大挫伤，打出了一片空前大好的形势。越南南方人民大量地消灭了敌人的有生力量。把广大解放区建成了坚不可摧的革命根据地，使一百多万美伪军队处于被动挨打的困境。越南北方军民大量地歼灭了美国空中强盗，击落敌机两千三百架之多，给南方同胞以有力支援。中国人民对越南人民所取得的每一个胜利，都感到欢欣鼓舞，并且引以自豪。
    英雄的越南人民是炸弹吓不倒、狡猾言辞骗不了的。去年七月，胡志明主席发表了气壮山河的号召书。最近，越南南方民族解放阵线公布了它的政治纲领，胡志明主席又庄严宣布：“越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”阮友寿主席也明确指出，要“继续加紧进行抗美救国的神圣战争，直到我们可爱的越南南方连一个美国侵略者也不剩时为止。”这些正义的表示，充分表达了三千一百万越南人民誓把抗美救国战争进行到底的钢铁般的决心。我们相信，越南人民发扬决战决胜的精神，再接再厉，坚持战斗，一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，夺取最后的胜利。
    越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的胜利，不仅为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大榜样，而且创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家运用人民战争的战略战术，单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的光辉范例。越南人民的胜利，打乱了美帝国主义反革命全球战略的部署，支持了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝革命斗争，为全世界人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争，作出了非常宝贵的贡献。
    目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大军事冒险，同时，继续玩弄“和谈”阴谋。苏修领导集团一直积极配合，为美帝的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。最近，美苏正在策划“停炸诱和”的新骗局，妄图利用联合国插手越南问题。越南政府已经发表声明，坚决反对联合国的干预。我们一贯认为，越南问题同联合国根本无关，联合国根本无权过问越南问题，越南问题只能按照越南民主共和国的四点主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明解决。任何人企图通过联合国来出卖越南人民抗美救国神圣事业的阴谋，越南人民坚决反对，中国人民坚决反对，世界革命人民也不会通过。
    同志们，朋友们，当前，我们的国家也面临一片大好的革命形势。由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的胜利。全国人民正在高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起一个革命大批判、革命大联合、革命“三结合”的新高潮，更深入、更广泛地把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    经过这场文化大革命，我国将比过去任何时候都更加巩固，更加强大。我们将更好地贯彻毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，更有力地执行我国对外政策总路线，更有效地支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国战争和世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义被我们的文化大革命吓破了胆，正在加紧勾结，掀起一个新的反华高潮。但是，它们这样做，绝对挽救不了它们必然灭亡的命运。它们只是一小撮，根本代表不了它们国家绝大多数人民的意志。它们是纸老虎，并没有什么了不起的力量。它们越是反华，越加证明毛泽东思想的威力强大无比，越加证明它们的末日快到了。
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦。中国人民和越南人民是亲密的战友和兄弟。美帝国主义是中、越两国人民不共戴天的共同敌人。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的困难就是我们的困难，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。中国人民一向遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，坚决把中国提供作越南人民的可靠后方。不论美帝国主义怎样疯狂地扩大战争，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民都将坚定不渝地同越南人民并肩战斗，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    现在我提议：
    为越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，
    为中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，
    为中、越两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊，
    为越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的身体健康，
    为越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席的身体健康，
    为我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的身体健康，
    为黎清毅同志、黄文欢同志和黄文旦团长的身体健康，
    为在座的使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的同志们和朋友们的身体健康，
    干杯！
