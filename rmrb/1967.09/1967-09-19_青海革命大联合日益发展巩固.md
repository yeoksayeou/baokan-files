Following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle

The great revolutionary alliance in Qinghai continues to develop and consolidate. In the Xining region, unified revolutionary mass organizations have been established in various systems, and revolutionary alliance organizations have been formed in various prefectures and counties, uniting the vast majority of the masses and cadres, concentrating firepower to carry out a great revolutionary criticism, and the Qinghai Plateau presents a great and good situation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 18—The August 18th proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai Province, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, and in the great revolutionary criticism, further develops and consolidates the great revolutionary alliance, achieves and strengthens the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," making the proletarian cultural revolution on the Qinghai Plateau present a great and inspiring situation.

"Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a surging revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." In the struggle against Khrushchev in China and his agents in Qinghai, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai deeply understands the great significance of achieving a great revolutionary alliance, and therefore they spare no effort to achieve, develop, and consolidate the great revolutionary alliance. The revolutionary faction has never split into two irreconcilable factions. As early as January this year, the August 18th and more than forty other revolutionary mass organizations united to jointly fight against the enemy. After smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration tide in February, the proletarian revolutionary faction further achieved a great alliance by department and system. By the end of June, various factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools in the Xining region had established unified revolutionary mass organizations, and had established the August 18th Revolutionary Rebel Alliance Committee in eight systems, including industry and transportation, finance and trade, agriculture and animal husbandry, education and health, and political and legal affairs. On the basis of the great revolutionary alliance, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee—was officially established in mid-August. This is a great victory for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

After the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, further developed and consolidated the great revolutionary alliance in the great revolutionary criticism. In the Xining region, units that had not previously participated in the great alliance have joined the great alliance by system and department. Various autonomous prefectures and counties have also established August 18th revolutionary faction alliance organizations. At the same time, in the grassroots units of the Xining region, more than twenty factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools have respectively achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and established revolutionary committees. The preparatory committees for the revolutionary committees of Xining City and some prefectures and counties have also been successively established. On the vast Qinghai Plateau, an organized and led, closely united revolutionary army has been established in the stormy waves of class struggle and is continuously developing and growing.

The great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai Province has been able to continuously develop and consolidate because they listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road led by Khrushchev in China, and put the development of the great revolutionary criticism in the first place. Before seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai had already directed the spearhead against Khrushchev in China and his agents in Qinghai, and achieved the great revolutionary alliance in the process of launching a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against Khrushchev in China and his agents in Qinghai. After the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, they further pushed the great revolutionary criticism to a new high tide. Now, revolutionary criticism columns are everywhere in the streets of Xining, and various systems and units are holding large and small criticism meetings and struggle meetings, drawing the broad revolutionary masses into the revolutionary tide of great criticism. In the great revolutionary criticism, the broad August 18th revolutionary faction fighters and revolutionary masses are further united, and more and more units achieve or consolidate the great revolutionary alliance in the great revolutionary criticism, and more revolutionary masses join the ranks of the August 18th revolutionary faction.

In the process of achieving, consolidating, and developing the great revolutionary alliance, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Qinghai Province always remembers Chairman Mao's great teaching that the proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all mankind, and actively and enthusiastically unites, wins over, and educates the deceived masses. They do not calculate personal grudges with the deceived masses, do not retaliate, but patiently help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, enthusiastically encourage them to make a comeback and perform new deeds for the people. In this way, the vast majority of the masses are closely united around the revolutionary faction.

In the process of promoting the great revolutionary alliance through the great revolutionary criticism, the August 18th revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses in Qinghai, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of believing in and relying on the majority of the cadres, make a comprehensive and historical analysis of the cadres, and adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" for cadres who have made mistakes. On the one hand, they patiently help them actively participate in the great revolutionary criticism, and on the other hand, they boldly use them in work and let them undergo new tests, thus uniting the majority of the cadres and promoting the great revolutionary alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Within the working class under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions. The broad proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses in Qinghai Province, in combination with their own struggle practice, studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction. Everyone was extremely excited and said: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao once again pointed out the road to victory for us at the critical moment of struggle. Chairman Mao has spoken our hearts. They deeply felt that in the process of achieving and consolidating the great revolutionary alliance, there will also be this or that disagreement and contradiction within the revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses. However, when these problems are still in their infancy, the responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations should sit together to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," conduct rectification, and engage in self-criticism. On the basis of a unified direction, some ideological problems that are temporarily not unified should be sought for common ground while reserving differences. In handling the mutual relationships of various revolutionary mass organizations, regardless of the size of the organization, the method of equal consultation should be adopted, and full fermentation should be carried out. The revolutionary faction organizations of many units in Qinghai Province have done this, and some have even established a regular small rectification system, widely soliciting the opinions of the masses. Therefore, they can firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, clear away the ideological obstacles in the great revolutionary alliance, and strengthen unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 青海革命大联合日益发展巩固

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    青海革命大联合日益发展巩固
    西宁地区各系统都建立了统一革命群众组织，各州县成立了革命派联合组织，团结了绝大多数群众和干部，集中火力开展革命大批判，青海高原一派大好形势
    据新华社西宁十八日电　青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，在革命的大批判中进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合，实现和加强革命的“三结合”，使青海高原的无产阶级文化大革命呈现出一派令人振奋的大好形势。
    “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”在同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人的斗争中，青海省无产阶级革命派深深认识到实现革命大联合的重大意义，因而他们不遗余力地为实现、发展和巩固革命的大联合而努力，革命派一直没有分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。早在今年一月，“八·一八”等四十多个革命群众组织，就联合起来，共同对敌。今年二月粉碎反革命复辟逆流以后，无产阶级革命派又进一步实现了按部门、按系统的大联合。到今年六月底，西宁地区的各厂矿企业、机关和学校，都建立了统一的革命群众组织，并且按工业交通、财贸、农牧、文教卫生、政法等八个系统，分别建立了“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会。在革命大联合基础上，八月中旬正式成立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——青海省革命委员会。这是无产阶级革命派大联合的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    在青海省革命委员会成立以后，广大革命群众在省革命委员会的领导下，进一步在革命的大批判中发展和巩固革命的大联合。在西宁地区，原来没有参加大联合的一些单位，纷纷参加按系统、按部门的大联合。各自治州和县，也都成立了“八·一八”革命派的联合组织。与此同时，在西宁地区的基层单位中，已有二十多个厂矿企业、机关和学校分别实现了革命的“三结合”，建立了革命委员会。西宁市和一些州、县的革命委员会筹备小组，也先后成立。在广阔的青海高原上，一支有组织有领导的、紧密团结的革命大军，已经在阶级斗争的大风大浪中建立起来，并且正在不断地发展和壮大。
    青海省无产阶级革命派的大联合所以能够得到不断的发展和巩固，最根本的原因是他们最听毛主席的话，始终把斗争矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把开展革命的大批判放在第一位。青海省的无产阶级革命派在夺权之前，就把矛头对准了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人，在对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争的过程中实现了革命的大联合。在青海省革命委员会成立以后，又进一步把革命的大批判推向新的高潮。现在，西宁街头革命大批判专栏林立，各系统各单位纷纷召开大大小小的批判会、斗争会，把广大革命群众都卷入大批判的革命潮流。在革命的大批判中，广大“八·一八”革命派战士和革命群众进一步团结起来，越来越多的单位在革命的大批判中实现或巩固了革命的大联合，更多的革命群众参加了“八·一八”革命派的队伍。
    在实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合的过程中，青海省无产阶级革命派牢记毛主席无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的伟大教导，主动地积极地团结、争取和教育受蒙蔽的群众。他们对受蒙蔽的群众不计个人恩怨，不打击报复，而是耐心地帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，热情地鼓励他们大杀回马枪，为人民立新功。这样，绝大多数群众紧密地团结在革命派的周围。
    在通过革命大批判推进革命大联合的过程中，青海“八·一八”革命派和革命群众遵照毛主席相信和依靠干部的大多数的伟大教导，对干部作全面的历史的分析，对犯错误的干部采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，一方面耐心地帮助他们积极投入革命的大批判，一方面在工作中大胆地使用他们，让他们接受新的考验，从而团结了干部的大多数，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。青海省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，结合自己的斗争实践学习了毛主席的这个最新指示。大家都万分激动地说：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席又一次在斗争的关键时刻给我们指明了胜利的道路。毛主席他老人家说出了我们的心里话。他们深有体会地说，在实现和巩固革命的大联合的过程中，在革命派和革命群众内部也会出现这样或那样的分歧和矛盾。但是，当这些问题还处于萌芽状态的时候，革命群众组织的负责人，就应该坐在一起学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的光辉著作，进行整风，互相多作自我批评。在大方向一致的基础上，有些思想问题暂时得不到统一，就求大同，存小异。在处理各革命群众组织的相互关系时，不论组织大小，都采取平等协商的办法，充分酝酿。青海省不少单位的革命派组织都是这样做的，有的还建立了定期小整风制度，广泛征求群众意见。因此他们能够牢牢掌握斗争大方向，扫清革命大联合中的思想障碍，在毛泽东思想的基础上，加强团结。
