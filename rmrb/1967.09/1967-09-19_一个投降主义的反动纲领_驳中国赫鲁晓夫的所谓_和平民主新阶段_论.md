The torrential flow of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought the number one capitalist-roader in the Party to the judgment of history.

When you tear off his disguise as an "old revolutionary," you will find the old revisionist marks of Bernstein, Kautsky, and the like on his buttocks. As early as more than twenty years ago, when the Chinese people, after eight years of bloody struggle, had won the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of a peaceful democratic new stage" had already vividly sketched out his old counter-revolutionary ugly face.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China faced a great decisive battle between two destinies and two futures:

"Was it to establish a new democratic state led by the proletariat and for the people, or to establish a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie?"

On this fundamental issue concerning the Chinese revolution and world revolution, there were two diametrically opposed lines within the Chinese Communist Party.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong was to mobilize the masses, expand the people's strength, and engage in a struggle of tit-for-tat and inch-by-inch resistance against the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries to thoroughly complete the democratic revolution and thus establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat.

The right-opportunist, capitulationist line represented by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party was to oppose violent revolution, abolish armed struggle, and in the face of the rampant attacks of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, "retreat three steps," advocating the establishment of a "peaceful state" through the "parliamentary road" to "cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek in building the country," pushing the Chinese people, who had just stood up from under the colonial yoke of Japanese fascism, back into the abyss of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of a peaceful democratic new stage" was precisely such a thoroughgoing revisionist political program, a thoroughgoing program of class capitulationism and national capitulationism.

The Myth of Pacifism

Just after the end of World War II, the Chinese Khrushchev hurriedly made reports and wrote articles. In his "Report to Comrades Going to Work in the Northeast," "The Current Situation and Tasks," and "Report on the Political Situation," he fabricated a set of pacifist myths.

He believed: "After the war, 'the whole world is a world of peace, democracy, and unity,' 'the stage of world peace construction has come, there will be no more wars, and it will be a lasting peace.'"

He believed: "Imperialism has not only changed its nature of aggression and war, but will also sympathize with and aid the people's revolution." He smugly said: "The U.S. government also 'needs' peace, 'the U.S. does not want China to have a civil war,'" and the U.S. will "aid the Chinese democratic movement."

He believed: "The Chinese people do not need to carry out a domestic revolutionary war to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, but should engage in 'peaceful state-building' with Chiang Kai-shek." He went around advocating: "The civil war will not be fought," "the three major parties should cooperate," "Chiang Kai-shek also wants to 'really discuss a few issues,'" "the three major classes of the Chinese people want democracy," and so on.

Did the development of history really go as the Chinese Khrushchev imagined? We need to look back at the history of the late 1940s to expose the Chinese Khrushchev's lies.

After the end of World War II, Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound analysis of the world situation. He said: "After the defeat of the fascist aggressor countries, the end of World War II, and the realization of international peace, it does not mean that there will be no more struggles. The widespread remnants of fascism will definitely cause trouble; the anti-democratic and oppressive forces of other nations within the anti-fascist invasion war camp still want to oppress the peoples of various countries and the colonies and semi-colonies. Therefore, after the realization of international peace, the struggle between the people's anti-fascist masses and the remnants of fascism, the struggle between democracy and anti-democracy, and the struggle between national liberation and national oppression will still fill most parts of the world."

For imperialism, peace is only a continuation of its wartime policy. Imperialist peace is maintained by continuous wars of plunder against the colonies and semi-colonies. And the revolutionary people must use just revolutionary wars to oppose unjust counter-revolutionary wars. As long as imperialism exists for one more day, the people's revolutionary wars will not stop for one more day. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "lasting world peace," isn't it equivalent to saying that imperialism has put down its butcher's knife and become a Buddhist? Isn't it equivalent to saying that the peoples of the colonies and semi-colonies do not need to carry out national liberation wars? Isn't it equivalent to saying that the proletariat of the capitalist world should not carry out domestic revolutionary wars? It is very clear that the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "lasting world peace" is a thoroughly reactionary theory of abolishing revolution. It is not only a deception of the proletariat but also a service to the two-handed counter-revolutionary policy of imperialism.

While the Chinese Khrushchev was chanting the scriptures of peace, he also effortlessly declared on behalf of the U.S. government that it "needs" peace and that it would "aid the Chinese democratic movement." Let's see the "aid" that the Chinese Khrushchev loves to talk about!

From September 1945 to June 1946, the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek transport 540,000 troops to surround and attack the liberated areas. From 1945 to 1949, the U.S. provided Chiang Kai-shek with military aid worth more than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars. During the same period, the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek equip 840,000 troops. In addition, U.S. imperialism also sent troops to invade China. This is the "aid" of the U.S.! All this "aid" was completely used by Chiang Kai-shek for the counter-revolutionary civil war to massacre the Chinese people. What "aid to the Chinese democratic movement" is this? It is all nonsense.

What is clearly U.S. imperialist naked aggression, the Chinese Khrushchev says is the U.S. "needing" peace; what is clearly U.S. imperialism providing money and guns to support Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, the Chinese Khrushchev says is "the U.S. does not want China to have a civil war." Isn't this recognizing the enemy as the father?!

The Chinese Khrushchev is not only a missionary of bourgeois pacifism but also an abolitionist of domestic revolutionary wars. He played tricks with opportunism, constantly releasing smoke bombs of peace.

First, he said: "peaceful state-building." Building what kind of state? Is it to build a bourgeois state or a proletarian state? If it is to build a bourgeois state, at that time the big landlords and big bourgeoisie represented by Chiang Kai-shek had already usurped state power, so what "state-building" is there to speak of? If it is to build a proletarian dictatorship, then it is necessary to seize power by force, so how can "peace" be discussed?

Second, he said: "The civil war will not be fought again." This is just the Chinese Khrushchev's one-sided wishful thinking. Even when he was happily whitewashing Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Kai-shek was mobilizing troops and launching a large-scale attack on the liberated areas. In July 1945, the Kuomintang bandit army of Hu Zongnan attacked the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region. In September, the bandit army of Yan Xishan attacked the Shangdang area of Shanxi. In September and October, the Kuomintang bandit army attacked the Handan area of Hebei. From August to October, the Kuomintang bandit army attacked the Hubei-Henan liberated area. And so on. Are these bloody facts the "civil war will not be fought again" that the Chinese Khrushchev talked about?

Third, he said: "The three major parties should cooperate," and it should be "long-term cooperation," and Chiang Kai-shek also "wants to really discuss a few issues." This is a typical class capitulationism! The Chinese Communist Party, which represents the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, how can it "long-term cooperate" with the Kuomintang reactionaries, who represent the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie and rely on imperialism? How can we forget the Kuomintang reactionaries' April 12 bloody massacre? How can we forget the Kuomintang reactionaries dragging the people into a decade of civil war? How can we forget the Kuomintang reactionaries launching three waves of anti-communist campaigns during the War of Resistance Against Japan? How can the revolutionary people have a common language to "discuss issues" with Chiang Kai-shek, who is a triad of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war?

Fourth, he said: "The three major classes of the Chinese people want democracy, the laboring people, the intermediate bourgeoisie, and a part of the big bourgeoisie demand Chinese democracy." Here, the Chinese Khrushchev once again brought out the reactionary old goods of "general democracy" from Kautsky and the like. Marxism tells us that democracy has always been class-based. Can the big landlords and big bourgeoisie share "general democracy" with the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people? No, the "democracy" of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie is the oppression and dictatorship over the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, it is to implement the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship of fascism! In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, the big landlords and big bourgeoisie have also become the people, this is a great insult to the Chinese people!

The Chinese Khrushchev would vigorously defend himself, saying: "The people need peace." Yes, the people need peace. But the peace you need is fundamentally different from the peace you talk about. The people know very well: true peace can only be fought for, and it will never be like you, with a servile and flattering attitude, to beg for peace.

A Traitor to Violent Revolution

In the great practice of the Chinese people's eight-year war of resistance, the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on violent revolution shone with brilliant light.

Just after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong sounded the alarm for the whole Party and the people of the whole country. He said: "Chiang Kai-shek always wants to force the people to accept war, he holds a knife in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. We will follow his method and also pick up the knife."

At that time, the Chinese Communist Party led a million-strong army and two million militiamen. At the critical moment when Chiang Kai-shek was about to launch a full-scale civil war, it was necessary to persist in defeating the armed counter-revolutionaries with armed revolution, this was the only correct path for the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to win the victory of the proletarian revolution.

On the fundamental issue of armed struggle, what role did the number one capitalist-roader in the Party play?

Look at him, in the face of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries sharpening their knives, he kept playing the tune of the "theory of conditions for armed struggle," saying that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, "the main form of struggle of the Chinese revolution has currently changed from armed struggle to non-armed, mass, and parliamentary struggle," "armed struggle has generally stopped."

Look at him, he was like a slave kneeling at the feet of his master, vigorously advocating the abolition of our Party's leadership over the army, wanting to hand over the people's armed forces to the tyrant and bandit Chiang Kai-shek. He said: "Our army will soon be reorganized into regular national armies and local self-defense corps and guards. After the reorganization, political commissars, Party branches, Party committees, etc., will be abolished, the Party will stop directly guiding the army, (after a few months, it will begin to be implemented) and will no longer issue direct orders to the army."

On the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek had said: "The Communist Party must hand over the army to have a legal position." The words had not yet fallen, and the Chinese Khrushchev had already understood. He said: "The relationship between our Party and the army will be modeled after the relationship between the Kuomintang and the army," "only in this way can the army created by our Party in eighteen years be legal and preserved."

This is truly a master-servant duet, things of the same kind. The Chinese Khrushchev's bizarre talk against armed struggle is precisely his confession of selling himself to the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.

Marxism-Leninism tells us that violent revolution is the universal law of the proletarian revolution. Whether or not to recognize this has always been the dividing line between proletarian revolutionaries and all traitors to the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of violent revolution. Chairman Mao particularly pointed out: "The main method of the Chinese revolution, the main form of the Chinese revolution, cannot be peaceful, but must be armed." "In China, without armed struggle, there will be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, no victory for the revolution.... This experience bought with blood, all comrades in the Party must not forget."

"In China, without armed struggle, there will be no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, no victory for the revolution.... This experience bought with blood, all comrades in the Party must not forget."

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party insisted that "armed struggle has generally stopped." This means that he openly declared that the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on violent revolution have become outdated. This means that he has completely abandoned the great teachings of Marxism-Leninism and has become a traitor to the violent revolution of the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in the article "On the Chongqing Talks": "The people's armed forces, one gun, one bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." In the face of the armed attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's hundreds of thousands of reactionary troops, "stopping" the armed struggle of the revolutionary people is not to sit and wait for death, but to seek annihilation? In this situation, "abolishing" our Party's leadership over the army and handing over the people's armed forces, is it not equivalent to handing over the knife to Chiang Kai-shek and then asking Chiang Kai-shek to come and chop off our heads?

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party's proposal to "reorganize" and "nationalize" the army is to "reorganize" our Party-led people's army into Chiang Kai-shek's "national army," it is to "nationalize" the people's army into the property of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Isn't this the same as the fascist leader Chiang Kai-shek's constant cry of "you first hand over the army, I will give you democracy"?

This faithful spokesman for the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries also used the vulgar and despicable language of a petty bourgeois to say: "The army takes a step back, the whole country makes great progress," "this step back... is profitable, it is money-making." Look, he is clearly trying to make a great historical retreat, but he says "great progress of the whole country"; he is clearly trying to make a great political sale, but he says "profitable," "money-making."

What a "profitable," "money-making"! This is the typical language of political speculators.

A Dead-End Road to Destroy the Revolution

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party so deeply hated violent revolution, so what was he infatuated with and yearned for?

Let's look at his own answer!

In February 1946, the Chinese Khrushchev, in the two infamous reports he made on the same day, repeatedly emphasized: "The main form of struggle of the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary, the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle," "all political issues must be peacefully resolved." In China, "it is possible to achieve success in the democratic revolution without going through a civil war, the basic success is through the constitution, the establishment of a parliament."

This greedy fellow still could not forget to share the leftovers of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries. With astonishing madness, he advocated: "You must know how to make propaganda, make speeches, make election campaigns, and get everyone to vote for you," "in Beijing and Tianjin, we have not yet entered with our guns, but if we do well in parliamentary struggle, we can enter with votes." He drooled and shouted: "After the Political Consultative Conference, ... we will become one of the government parties, not in the opposition but in the government, some people will go to be officials. Central government officials, ... it is possible to participate for a long time."

Enough! Enough! The Chinese Khrushchev was originally such a genuine parliamentary fanatic!

In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, the convening of the old Political Consultative Conference "made the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek unable to continue its one-party dictatorship and began to implement national democratization." Therefore, the work of the whole Party should and could "transform into non-armed, mass, and parliamentary struggle." In the eyes of this parliamentary fanatic, the "parliamentary road" has become a panacea for the victory of the Chinese revolution.

Facts cannot be distorted, history cannot be falsified! Those who try to manipulate history at will will eventually become criminals of history.

Our great leader Chairman Mao had long ago clearly pointed out that in the old China under the brutal rule of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, "there is no democratic system inside, but oppression by the feudal system; there is no national independence outside, but oppression by imperialism. Therefore, there is no parliament that can be utilized, no legal right for workers to organize strikes. Here, the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter the uprising and war through long-term legal struggle, nor is it to first occupy the cities and then take the countryside, but to take the opposite road."

From the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, so-called parliaments are only decorative items and screens of bourgeois dictatorship, tools for the bourgeoisie to rule the proletariat. And the so-called "parliamentary road" is a reactionary political proposition put forward by traitors to the proletariat to cater to the needs of the bourgeoisie, it is a thoroughgoing revisionist commodity.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, where could the Chinese Khrushchev find the kind of "peace, democracy, and unity" atmosphere he described in China? And where could he find half a point of sincerity in the Kuomintang reactionaries' "abandoning one-party dictatorship" and implementing national democratization?

The reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek implemented the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Its main components of the state machine did not exist at all, but were armed to the teeth with hundreds of thousands of reactionary troops equipped by the U.S. In the conditions of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship, to want to achieve revolutionary victory through the "parliamentary road," that is a shameless deception of the proletariat and revolutionary people, just as Lenin said: "If the class struggle is limited to parliamentary struggle, or if parliamentary struggle is considered the highest, decisive, and controlling all other forms of struggle, that is to actually go to the side of the bourgeoisie and against the proletariat."

The Chinese Khrushchev painstakingly created a fantasy of a road to the "parliamentary palace," that is, to solve the problem of the Chinese democratic revolution through "election campaigns" and "votes"; that is to "reorganize the government," "formulate the constitution," and send Communist Party members to the Kuomintang reactionary government to "be officials" to "destroy" the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and implement "peaceful transition."

This is simply a dream of a madman!

How can one imagine, under the fascist dictatorship of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, that with a three-inch tongue, one can launch a democratic "election campaign," and formulate a constitution that reflects the will of the proletariat?

Even if one gets a half-official position and a few votes, but loses the Party's leadership and abandons the people's armed forces, how can one touch a hair of the Chiang family dynasty with votes and official hats?

Lenin had long ago scolded such opportunist clowns: "Only a scoundrel or a fool would think that the proletariat should first utilize the voting method under the oppression of the bourgeoisie and wage slavery to obtain a majority, and then go to seize power. This is the height of stupidity or the height of hypocrisy, this is to replace class struggle and revolution with voting under the old system of power."

The Chinese Khrushchev is precisely the kind of big scoundrel that Lenin talked about. He advocated the "parliamentary road" precisely to curry favor with the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, precisely to escape the revolutionary battlefield of cannon fire and run to the Kuomintang government to sit in a comfortable chair and enjoy the fat positions of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. This shameless person, precisely for the sake of this "small convenience," betrayed the fundamental interests of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

If we followed him, it would be to surrender to the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, and our Party would become an election party, a parliamentary party, and would become a pitiful tool for maintaining bourgeois rule.

If we followed him, it would make the Chinese revolution half-hearted, and China would forever be the extremely dark old China under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and it would never have today's bright new China under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to find a cover for his capitulationist line, actually learned the tone of Kautsky and Trotsky, accusing our Party of "not believing that the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek, under pressure from all sides, can also implement democratic reforms and can continue to cooperate with our Party to build the country, not believing that the peaceful democratic new stage has arrived, and therefore taking a skeptical attitude," committing "narrow 'left' sectarianism." He shouted in a rage: "This tendency is dangerous."

This is truly a pig's paw hitting a monkey's bottom.

According to the logic of the Chinese Khrushchev, whoever goes against his will and does not want to go to the Kuomintang reactionary government to "be an official" is "narrow"; whoever opposes him handing over the people's army and abandoning armed struggle to engage in dirty political transactions is "left-opportunism"; whoever does not listen to his nonsense and does not let the Kuomintang and other parties also come to the liberated areas to set up news agencies, publish newspapers, set up party branches, and talk about unity, and not "come to participate in our government," is the so-called "sectarianism."

Who is it, the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao, that has insisted on the Marxist-Leninist line, or you, the Chinese Khrushchev, who has suffered from incurable right-opportunist capitulationism?

No need for further proof. History has already given the correct answer.

The Historical Lesson

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party so vigorously advocated the reactionary fallacy of the "peaceful democratic new stage" and so fervently promoted the line of class capitulationism and national capitulationism, this was not an accidental, isolated phenomenon.

Lenin, in criticizing the revisionists of the Second International, once said: "Opportunism is not an accidental phenomenon, not the sin, negligence, and betrayal of individual persons, but the social product of a whole historical period."

During World War II, while the international communist movement achieved great development, it also produced its opposite, that is, a counter-revolutionary revisionist current emerged. The main feature of this current was to abolish violent revolution and advocate the parliamentary road. This current brought great losses to the international communist movement. The setbacks of the revolutions in France, Italy, and other countries were the most prominent examples.

The French Communist Party, during the anti-fascist war, organized a people's armed force of 500,000, once liberated Paris.

But the general secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, regarded the people's armed forces as a flood of disaster. In November 1944, this coward who had long been hiding in a foreign harbor, returned to France and handed over all the people's armed forces in exchange for a vice-premier's hat. In November 1945, the French Communist Party participated in the first National Assembly elections of the de Gaulle government and once formed the so-called "leftist majority" in the parliament. But the French bourgeoisie easily amended the election law. By the time of the 1958 parliamentary elections, the seats obtained by the French Communist Party were only a few dozen.

This is just as a conscious French Communist Party member said, the French bourgeoisie treated the French Communist Party like squeezing a lemon, squeezing it dry and then throwing away the dregs.

The situation in Italy was similar. Before and after the end of World War II, the armed struggle in Italy developed vigorously, forming a guerrilla force and an insurgent workers' force of 256,000 people, liberating more than 200 large and small cities, capturing the fascist leader Mussolini and executing him.

But the general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, who had been living abroad for eighteen years, returned to Italy and proposed a line of capitulationism that was "not to resort to the use of force and uprising," but to realize socialism by reforming the social structure, forcing the guerrillas in northern Italy to accept the unified command of the Badoglio reactionary government and the "Allies," and disarming the guerrillas and patriotic police. Togliatti betrayed the fundamental interests of the proletariat in exchange for the titles of minister and vice-premier, but the victory fruits of the Italian people's anti-fascist armed struggle were all turned into nothing.

In addition to France and Italy, similar things happened in some other countries in Europe and Asia, and the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs became the wine in the enemy's cup!

Comrades, think about it, in the face of the butcher's knife of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, if our Party and the people of our country had believed the "peaceful democratic new stage" myth fabricated by the Chinese Khrushchev and gone down the "parliamentary road," what serious consequences would have been produced?

History mercilessly mocked the "parliamentary fanatics" like Thorez, Togliatti, and the Chinese Khrushchev. The painful historical lessons have enlightened the eyes of Marxist-Leninists all over the world. The revolutionary peoples of the world have increasingly deeply realized from their own struggle experience that the gun in the hands of the people is the lifeblood of the people's revolution; the road of armed struggle is the only correct road for the proletariat to seize power. Whoever denies violent revolution is fundamentally betraying Marxism-Leninism, fundamentally betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause; whoever is infatuated with the "parliamentary road" will only end up with the shameful fate of Thorez, Togliatti, and the like. As Stalin said: "If one thinks that such a revolution can be carried out in a peaceful way within the framework of bourgeois democracy suitable for the rule of the bourgeoisie, that is either mental derangement, nervous breakdown, or a blatant betrayal of the proletarian revolution."

The new and old revisionists, along with their fabricated "theory" of the "parliamentary road," are only snowmen in the sun, which will all melt away once they are tested by history. But the Marxist-Leninist theory of violent revolution is like an evergreen pine tree, standing tall and firm.

The greatest happiness of the Chinese people is that we have the great helmsman Chairman Mao leading the revolutionary ship. At the critical moment when the evil winds were rising and the great river was shrouded in fog, Chairman Mao led the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to resolutely resist the "surrender of arms" current and smashed the reactionary line of class capitulationism and national capitulationism of the Chinese Khrushchev. The great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party raised the banner of armed struggle, won the great victory of the Chinese revolution, and set up an eternal monument in the history of the international communist movement.

    一个投降主义的反动纲领
    ——驳中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“和平民主新阶段”论	任立新
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派推上了历史的审判台。
    撕开他“老革命”的外衣，人们便会发现，他的臀部带有伯恩施坦、考茨基之流的老修正主义印记。早在二十多年前，当中国人民经过八年烽火漫天的浴血斗争，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利的时候，这个中国赫鲁晓夫提出的“和平民主新阶段”论，就已经维妙维肖地勾划出他老反革命的丑恶嘴脸。
    抗日战争胜利后，中国面临着两种命运、两个前途的大决战：
    “是建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家呢，还是建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？”
    在这个关系中国革命和世界革命的根本问题上，中国共产党内存在着两条根本对立的路线。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是要放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，同美蒋反动派进行针锋相对、寸土必争的斗争，彻底完成民主革命，从而建立一个无产阶级领导的人民民主专政的国家。
    以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的右倾投降主义路线，则是反对暴力革命，取消武装斗争，在美蒋反动派的猖狂进攻面前“退避三舍”，主张通过合法的“议会道路”，去同蒋介石“合作建国”，把刚从日本法西斯殖民枷锁下站起来的中国人民重新推到半殖民地半封建的深渊。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“和平民主新阶段”论，就是这样一个彻头彻尾的修正主义政治纲领，一个彻头彻尾的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的反动纲领。
        和　平　主　义　的　神　话
    第二次世界大战刚结束，中国赫鲁晓夫就匆匆忙忙作报告、写文章。他在《对出发东北工作同志的报告》，《目前形势与任务》及《时局问题的报告》中，编造了一套和平主义的神话。
    他认为：战后“全世界是个和平民主团结的世界”，“全世界的和平建设阶段来了，不打仗了，要搞和平，还是持久的和平”①。
    他认为：帝国主义不仅已经改变了侵略和战争的本性，而且会同情和援助人民革命。他美滋滋地说：美国政府也“同样需要”和平，“美国也不愿意中国打内战”②，美国也会“援助中国民主运动”③。
    他认为：中国人民没有必要进行国内革命战争，推翻国民党的反动政权，而要和蒋介石搞什么“和平建国”。他到处游说：“内战是不会打了”④，“三个主要政党要合作”⑤，蒋介石也要“真正商量几个问题”⑥，“中国人民三个主要阶级要民主”⑦，等等。
    历史的发展难道真是中国赫鲁晓夫所设想的那样吗？我们有必要来翻一翻四十年代后期的历史，揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫的这些谎言。
    第二次世界大战后，毛主席对世界形势作了精辟的分析。他说：“法西斯侵略国家被打败、第二次世界大战结束、国际和平实现以后，并不是说就没有了斗争。广泛地散布着的法西斯残余势力，一定还要捣乱；反法西斯侵略战争的阵营中存在着反民主的和压迫其他民族的势力，他们仍然要压迫各国人民和各殖民地半殖民地。所以，国际和平实现以后，反法西斯的人民大众和法西斯残余势力之争，民主和反民主之争，民族解放和民族压迫之争仍将充满世界的大部分地方。”⑧
    和平，对于帝国主义来说，只不过是它的战时政策的继续。帝国主义的和平是靠对殖民地半殖民地连绵不断的战争掠夺来维持着的。而革命人民要获得真正的和平，就必须用革命的正义战争来反对反革命的非正义战争。只要帝国主义还存在一天，人民的革命战争就一天也不能停止。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的世界“持久和平”论，那岂不是等于说，帝国主义已经放下屠刀、立地成佛了吗？那岂不是等于说，殖民地半殖民地人民不要进行民族解放战争了吗？那岂不是等于说，资本主义世界各国无产阶级也不要发动国内革命战争了吗？很清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫的世界“持久和平”论是地地道道的取消革命的反动理论。它不只是对无产阶级的欺骗，而且是在为帝国主义的反革命两手政策效劳。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在大念和平经的同时，又毫不费劲地代替美国政府宣布了“需要”和平，宣布了要“援助中国的民主运动”。那就让我们看看中国赫鲁晓夫津津乐道地谈论的“美国援助”吧！
    从一九四五年九月到一九四六年六月，美国帮助蒋介石运兵五十四万包围和进攻解放区。从一九四五年到一九四九年美国给蒋介石总值五十九亿多美元的军事援助。同一时期，美国帮助蒋介石先后装备了八十四万军队。除此以外，美帝国主义还亲自出兵侵略中国。这就是美国的“援助”！这些“美援”完全给了蒋介石用于反革命内战，屠杀中国人民。什么“援助中国的民主运动”，完完全全是鬼话。
    明明是美帝国主义赤裸裸的侵略，中国赫鲁晓夫却说是美国“需要”和平；明明是美帝国主义出钱出枪支持蒋介石打内战，中国赫鲁晓夫却说是“美国也不愿意中国打内战”。这不是认贼作父又是什么！？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫不仅是一个资产阶级和平主义的传教士，而且是国内革命战争的取消主义者。他大耍机会主义的邪术，连连施放和平烟幕弹。
    其一曰：“和平建国”。建国，建什么样的国？是建资产阶级之国，还是建无产阶级之国？如果要建资产阶级之国，在当时以蒋介石为代表的大地主、大资产阶级早已窃取了国家政权，有何“建国”可言？如果要建无产阶级专政之国，那就非用暴力夺取政权不可，“和平”又从何谈起？
    其二曰：“内战不会再打了”。这只不过是中国赫鲁晓夫一厢情愿的单相思罢了。就是在他喜气洋洋地为蒋介石粉饰升平的时候，蒋介石正在调兵遣将，大举进攻解放区。一九四五年七月国民党胡宗南匪军进攻陕甘宁边区。九月，阎锡山匪军进攻山西上党地区。九、十月间国民党匪军进攻河北邯郸地区。从八月到十月，国民党匪军进攻鄂豫解放区。如此等等。这些血淋淋的事实难道就是中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“内战不会再打了”吗？
    其三曰：“三个主要政党要合作”，而且是“长期合作”，蒋介石也“要真正商量几个问题”。这是典型的阶级投降主义！代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民利益的中国共产党，怎么能够和代表大地主大资产阶级利益、投靠帝国主义的国民党反动派“长期合作”呢？我们怎么能够忘记国民党反动派的“四·一二”血腥大屠杀呢？我们怎么能够忘记国民党反动派把人民拖进十年内战的血海呢？我们怎么能够忘记国民党反动派在抗日战争时期先后发动的三次反共高潮呢？革命的人民同卖国、独裁、内战三位一体的蒋介石，怎么能有共同语言来“商量问题”呢？
    其四曰：“中国人民三个主要阶层要民主，劳动人民，中等资产阶级中间派，一部分大资产阶级要求中国民主”。在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫又一次搬出了考茨基之流的“一般民主”的反动陈货。马克思主义告诉我们，民主从来是有阶级性的。大地主大资产阶级难道可以同无产阶级和广大劳动人民共享什么“一般民主”吗？不，大地主大资产阶级所谓的“民主”，就是对无产阶级和广大劳动人民的压迫和专政，就是要实行国民党“一党专政”的法西斯独裁！在中国赫鲁晓夫眼里，大地主大资产阶级也变成了人民，这真是对中国人民的莫大侮辱！
    中国赫鲁晓夫会振振有词地辩解说：“人民需要和平”。是的，人民是需要和平的。但是，人民所需要的和平同你说的和平有着本质的不同。人民十分懂得：真正的和平只能用斗争来争取，而决不会象你那样奴颜媚骨地去乞求和平。
      暴力革命的可耻叛徒
    在中国人民八年抗战的伟大实践中，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于暴力革命的学说，放射出万丈光焰。
    抗日战争刚一结束，毛主席就给全党和全国人民敲起了警钟。他说：“蒋介石总是要强迫人民接受战争，他左手拿着刀，右手也拿着刀。我们就按照他的办法，也拿起刀来。”⑨
    当时，中国共产党领导着一支一百万人的军队和二百万人的民兵。在蒋介石即将发动全面内战的严重时刻，坚持用武装的革命击败武装的反革命，这就是中国共产党和中国人民争取无产阶级革命胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    在武装斗争这一根本问题上，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，扮演了什么角色呢？
    你看他，在美蒋反动派磨刀霍霍声中，一个劲地弹着“武装斗争条件论”的滥调，说什么抗日战争胜利以后，“中国革命的主要斗争形式目前已由武装斗争变为非武装的、群众的与议会的斗争”，“武装斗争是一般的停止了”⑩。
    你看他，活象一个跪倒在主子脚下的奴才，竭力主张取消我们党对军队的领导，要把人民武装拱手交给独夫民贼蒋介石。他说：“我们的军队即将整编为正式国军及地方保安队自卫队等。在整编后的军队中，政治委员、党的支部、党务委员会等即将取消，党将停止对军队的直接指导，（在几个月之后开始实行）不再向军队发出直接指令。”?
    抗日战争胜利前夕，蒋介石曾经说过：“共产党交出军队，才有合法地位。”话音未落，中国赫鲁晓夫就心领神会了。他说：“我党与军队的关系将仿照国民党与军队的关系”?，“只有这样改变，我们党十八年创造的这支军队，才能合法，才能保存。”?
    这真是主唱仆和，物从其类。中国赫鲁晓夫这一段反对武装斗争的奇谈，就是他卖身投靠大地主、大资产阶级的绝妙的自供状。
    马克思列宁主义告诉我们，暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律。承认不承认这一点，从来是无产阶级革命家同一切无产阶级叛徒的分水岭。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于暴力革命的理论。毛主席特别强调指出：“中国革命的主要方法，中国革命的主要形式，不能是和平的，而必须是武装的”?。“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。……这个拿血换来的经验，全党同志都不要忘记。”?
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，一口咬定“武装斗争是一般地停止了”。这就是说，他公然宣称马克思列宁主义关于暴力革命的基本原理已经过时了。这就是说，他已经完全抛弃了马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，成了无产阶级暴力革命的可耻叛徒。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在《关于重庆谈判》一文中明确指出：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”在蒋介石几百万反动军队的武装进攻面前，“停止”革命人民的武装斗争，那不是坐以待毙，自取灭亡吗？在这种情况下“取消”我们党对军队的领导，把人民武装交出去，那不是等于把刀子送给蒋介石，再请蒋介石来砍我们的脑袋吗？
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所提出的军队要“整编”、要“国家化”，就是要把我们党所领导的人民军队“整编”到蒋介石的“国军”里去，就是要“化”人民军队为国民党反动政府所有。这和法西斯头子蒋介石一贯叫嚣的“你先交出军队，我就给你民主”不是如出一辙吗？
    这个美蒋反动派的忠实代言人，还用庸俗不堪的市侩的口吻说：“军队让一步，全国大进步”，“这一让步……是划得来的，是赚钱的”?。你看，他明明是要搞历史大倒退，却说什么“全国大进步”；他明明是要搞政治大拍卖，却说什么“划得来”、“赚钱”。
    好一个“划得来”、“赚钱”！这完全是政治投机商特有的行话。
        葬送革命的一条绝路
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，这样刻骨铭心地仇视暴力革命，那么，他所迷恋和向往的又是什么呢？
    让我们来看看他自己的回答吧！
    一九四六年二月，中国赫鲁晓夫在他同一天所做的那两个臭名昭著的报告中，三番五次地强调说：“中国革命主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”，“一切政治问题要和平解决”。在中国，“可能不再经过内战达到民主革命成功，基本成功是经过宪法，成立议会”?。
    这个利欲熏心的家伙，还念念不忘去分享美蒋反动派的残羹剩饭。他以令人吃惊的疯颠劲儿鼓吹说：“要会作宣传会演说，会作选举运动，要大家投你的票”，“平津我们枪杆子未打进去，要议会斗争弄得好，可以用选票进去”。他垂涎欲滴地叫道：“政协会后，……我们成为政府党之一，不是在野而是在朝了，有些人要去作官。中央政府的官，……可能长期参加”?。
    够了！够了！中国赫鲁晓夫原来就是这样一个货真价实的议会迷！
    在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，旧政治协商会议的召开“使得蒋介石国民党不得不放弃其一党独裁，并开始实行国家民主化”?。因此，全党的工作应当而且可能“转变到非武装的、群众的与议会的斗争中去”?。在这个议会迷的眼中，“议会道路”简直成了使中国革命取得胜利的一付万应灵药。
    事实不容歪曲，历史不容篡改！那些妄图任意摆布历史的人，到头来总是要变成历史的罪人。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就明确指出，在美蒋反动派残暴统治之下的旧中国，“在内部没有民主制度，而受封建制度压迫；在外部没有民族独立，而受帝国主义压迫。因此，无议会可以利用，无组织工人举行罢工的合法权利。在这里，共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”?
    从马克思列宁主义观点看来，所谓议会，只不过是资产阶级专政的装饰品和屏风，是资产阶级统治无产阶级的工具。而所谓“议会道路”，就是无产阶级的叛徒为了迎合资产阶级需要而提出的一种反动的政治主张，是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。
    抗日战争胜利以后的中国，哪里找得到中国赫鲁晓夫所描绘的那种充满着“和平、民主、团结”气氛的太平盛世呢？又哪里找得到国民党反动派“放弃一党独裁”、实现国家民主化的半点诚意呢？
    蒋介石反动政府，实行的是大地主大资产阶级专政。其国家机器的主要组成部分，根本就不存在什么议会，而是用美武装备武装到牙齿的几百万反动军队。在蒋介石法西斯独裁的条件下想要通过什么“议会道路”取得革命胜利，那完全是对无产阶级和革命人民无耻的欺骗，正如列宁所说：“如果把阶级斗争局限于议会斗争，或者认为议会斗争是最高的、决定性的、支配着其余一切斗争形式的斗争，那就是实际上转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级。”?
    中国赫鲁晓夫煞费苦心地创作了一支通往“议会之宫”的狂想曲，那就是，要通过“选举运动”，“用选票”解决中国民主革命的问题；那就是要通过“改组政府”，“制定宪法”，派共产党员到国民党反动政府里去“作官”，来“破坏”国民党一党独裁制度，实行“和平过渡”。
    简直是痴人说梦话！
    怎么能够设想，在美蒋反动派的法西斯专政之下，凭三寸不烂之舌，就能发动起什么民主的“选举运动”，就能制订出体现无产阶级意志的宪法呢？
    就算捞到了一官半职，抓到了几张选票，而丧失了党的领导，放弃了人民的武装，又能够用选票和乌纱帽去触动蒋家王朝的一根毫毛吗？
    列宁早就冲着这种机会主义小丑痛斥道：“只有坏蛋或者傻瓜才会认为，无产阶级应当首先利用资产阶级压迫下和雇佣奴隶制压迫下进行的投票方式取得多数，然后才去夺取政权。这是绝顶的愚蠢或绝顶的虚伪，这是用旧制度政权下的投票来代替阶级斗争和革命。”?
      中国赫鲁晓夫就是列宁所说的这种大坏蛋。他鼓吹“议会道路”，就是为了向大地主、大资产阶级献媚，就是为了逃脱炮火连天的革命阵地，跑到国民党政府里去坐一把安乐椅，去享受大地主、大资产阶级的肥缺。这个无耻之徒，就是为了占这点“小便宜”而出卖无产阶级革命事业的根本利益。
    如果依了他，那就是投降美蒋反动派，我们的党就会变成选举党、议会党，就会变成维护资产阶级统治的可怜巴巴的工具。
    如果依了他，那就会使中国革命半途而废，中国就永远是大地主、大资产阶级专政的无比黑暗的旧中国，而决不会有今天这样的无产阶级专政的无限光明的新中国。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，为了替他的投降主义路线找一块遮羞布，竟然学着考茨基和托洛茨基的腔调，指责我们党“不相信蒋介石国民党在各方面逼迫之下，也能实行民主改革，并能继续与我党合作建国，不相信和平民主新阶段已经到来，因而采取怀疑态度”?，犯了“狭隘的‘左’的关门主义”。他气急败坏地叫喊道：“这倾向是危险的”?。
    这真是猪八戒倒打一耙。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的这种逻辑，谁要是违背了他的心意，不愿到国民党反动政府里去“作官”，谁就是“狭隘”；谁要是反对他交出人民军队、放弃武装斗争，去进行肮脏的政治交易，谁就是“左倾”机会主义；谁要是不听他的鬼话，不让国民党各党派也到解放区来活动，设通讯社，办报纸，设党部，讲统一”，不也“来参加我们的政府”?，谁就是所谓“关门主义”。
    究竟是以毛主席为首的中国共产党坚持了马克思列宁主义路线，还是你中国赫鲁晓夫患了不可救药的右倾投降主义的顽症呢？
    无须多加证明。历史早已做出了正确的结论。
        历　史　的　教　训
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派这样大肆地宣扬“和平民主新阶段”的反动谬论，这样狂热地推行阶级投降主义和民族投降主义路线，决不是偶然的、孤立的现象。
    列宁在批判第二国际的修正主义者时曾经说过：“机会主义不是偶然的现象，不是个别人物的罪孽、疏忽和叛变，而是整个历史时代的社会产物。”?
    第二次世界大战期间，国际共产主义运动在获得了巨大的发展的同时，产生了自己的对立物，即冒出了一股反革命的修正主义逆流。这股逆流的主要特点就是取消暴力革命，鼓吹议会道路。这股逆流，给国际共产主义运动带来了巨大的损失。法国、意大利等国革命遭受挫折的事实，就是最突出的例子。
    法国共产党在反法西斯战争期间，曾经组织了一支拥有五十万人的人民武装，一度解放了巴黎。
    但是，法国共产党中央总书记多列士却视人民式装如洪水猛兽。一九四四年十一月，这个长期躲在国外避风港里的怕死鬼，回到了法国，就拱手交出了全部人民武装，换到了一顶副总理的乌纱帽。一九四五年十一月，法国共产党参加了戴高乐政府的第一次国民议会选举，曾一度形成了议会中的所谓“左派多数”。但是，法国资产阶级毫不费力地修改了选举法。到一九五八年的议会选举时，法国共产党所获得的席位就只有寥寥的十席了。
    这正象一个觉悟的法国共产党党员所说的，法国资产阶级对待法国共产党，就象挤柠檬一样，挤干了就把残渣扔掉。
    意大利的情形也是这样。第二次世界大战结束前后，意大利的武装斗争获得了蓬勃发展，形成了一支有二十五万六千人参加的游击队和起义工人队伍，解放了米兰、威尼斯等二百多个大小城市，俘获了法西斯头子墨索里尼并处以死刑。
    可是，侨居国外十八年的意大利共产党中央总书记陶里亚蒂回到意大利以后，就提出了一条“不是诉诸使用武力和举行起义”，而是通过改革社会结构来实现社会主义的投降主义路线，强迫北意大利的游击队接受了巴多里奥反动政府与“盟军”的统一指挥，解除了游击队和爱国警察的武装。陶里亚蒂出卖了无产阶级的根本利益，换得了部长、副总理的头衔，可是意大利人民反法西斯武装斗争的胜利果实，却统统化为了乌有。
    除法、意两国以外，在欧洲和亚洲的另一些国家里，也发生了类似的事情，多少革命烈士的鲜血变成了敌人杯里的酒浆！
    请同志们想一想，在美蒋反动派的屠刀面前，我们党和我国人民如果听信了中国赫鲁晓夫编造的“和平民主新阶段”的神话，也去走什么“议会道路”，那又将产生什么样的严重后果呢？
    历史无情地嘲弄了多列士、陶里亚蒂和中国赫鲁晓夫之流的“议会迷”。惨痛的历史教训，擦亮了全世界马克思列宁主义者的眼睛。世界各国革命人民从自己切身的斗争经验中越来越深刻地认识到：人民手中的枪杆子，就是人民革命的命根子；武装斗争的道路是无产阶级夺取政权的唯一正确的道路。谁否定暴力革命，谁就是从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义，谁就是从根本上出卖了无产阶级革命事业；谁迷恋“议会道路”，谁就只能落得多列士、陶里亚蒂之流的可耻下场。正如斯大林所说：“如果以为可以在适合于资产阶级统治的资产阶级民主制范围内，用和平方式来进行这样的革命，那不是精神错乱，神经失常，就是公然无耻地背叛了无产阶级革命。”?
    新老修正主义者连同他们所捏造的“议会道路”的“理论”，只不过是阳光下的雪人，一经历史的检验，便都冰消瓦解了。而马克思列宁主义的暴力革命学说，却象顶天立地的松柏，万古长青。
    中国人民最大最大的幸福，就是我们有伟大舵手毛主席在革命的航船上掌舵。在那妖风四起，大雾迷江的紧要关头，毛主席为首的中国共产党领导中国人民，坚决顶住了“交枪”的逆流，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义反动路线。伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党高举武装斗争的革命大旗，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利，在国际共产主义运动的历史上树立了一块万古不朽的丰碑。注释：
