	Pulling Out Two Poisonous Arrows
	Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Nán Yùjié

	The reactionary film "Stormy Waves" uses the mouth of the old fisherman to sing two interludes, which are two poisonous arrows shot at the Party and Chairman Mao.

	The first poisonous arrow: The old fisherman sings in a low voice, "In the past, the tiger went to learn the Dao, the tiger in the deep mountains suddenly encountered a cat, the cat taught the tiger the Dao, the tiger obtained the Dao and bit the cat." This is extremely obscure black talk. This interlude appears to be about the betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but in reality, it curses the Party for being "ungrateful," advocating for the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai, who was dismissed from office, and expressing indignation. The song implies that Peng Dehuai is the "cat" teaching the "tiger" the Dao, and today the "tiger" has obtained the "Dao" and bites the "cat," directly pointing at the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, who dismissed Peng Dehuai at the Lushan Conference. How malicious their intentions are! When Peng Dehuai was trying to rehabilitate himself, he arrogantly shouted, "I am 'half right, half wrong,' with mistakes and also merits"; he also said, "The Chairman's speech is too extreme," "How can I accept it?" This black song is in tune with Peng Dehuai's, exactly advocating for Peng Dehuai's rehabilitation and encouraging him to make a fierce comeback.

	The second poisonous arrow: In the film, when Old Fisherman accompanies the dismissed officer Luo Dacheng on his way, he sings in a sorrowful tone, "I send you off to the side of the road, your kindness will never be forgotten, the hearts of the villagers are bright, separated by mountains and rivers, forever looking at each other." This black song is not the same as the fabricated "clean official" Hai Rui in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," who, after being removed from his "official hat," is sent off by the people singing "Hai Qingtian"? There is also, "Which sharp sword can split water, which sharp knife can cut sorrow," "In the wind and waves, you sail the ship, I hold the spear and wait for your return." This is openly inciting a small group of dismissed right-opportunists not to forget their "grievances" and "hatred," to take up arms again, and to prepare for the day when Peng Dehuai will sail his revolutionary wreck of a "ship" back in the "wind and waves," continuing their evil schemes of capitalist restoration.

	We must firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, wield the thousand-catty rod of Mao Zedong Thought, pull out these two poisonous arrows, and smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai and the reactionary film "Stormy Waves" to smithereens!

	Do Not Allow the Beautification of the Opportunist Line
	Xīn Rènlì

	Is the Chinese revolution to take the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside, or the opposite path? This question has long been settled by history. However, the Chinese Khrushchev harbors evil intentions, saying, "The victory of the revolution, whether from the cities to the countryside or from the countryside to the cities, the result is the same, this is not a matter of principle." He blatantly distorts the history of the Chinese revolution and attacks Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Following his master's orders, some of the Chinese Khrushchev's lackeys have risen up, extensively beautifying the opportunist line. The reactionary film "Stormy Waves" is such a poisonous weed that viciously attacks Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, beautifies the "left" opportunist line, and erects a monument for the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai, who attempted to seize the Party and the army.

	The film "Stormy Waves" depicts the revolutionary struggle in Pingjiang after the "March 21 Incident" in 1927. At that time, Chairman Mao personally led the armed workers and peasants in Xiuming, Lianhua, Pingjiang, and Pingxiang, launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and marched towards Jinggangshan, establishing a revolutionary base area and opening up the correct path for the Chinese revolution to surround the cities from the countryside. However, the film praises the "left" opportunist line of attacking cities at all costs, carried out by Peng Dehuai and his ilk in Pingjiang at that time, extensively describing the "victory" of the "storming the city" battle. The film exaggerates the originally failed "storming the city" into an "exciting victory scene," attempting to make people believe that this adventurist line is the path to the success of the Chinese revolution. This is a vicious attack on the proletarian revolutionary line proposed by Chairman Mao that the Chinese revolution is "not to first occupy the cities and then take the countryside, but to take the opposite path"!

	Even more viciously, the creators of the film attribute the adventurist order to attack cities to Chairman Mao, falsely claiming it as Chairman Mao's "return letter instruction." They fabricated such a plot: Su Da Po brought a so-called "reply letter" from Chairman Mao, urging Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin to rise up and attack the city blindly. This is completely a reversal of black and white, confusing right and wrong, directly pointing the attack at Chairman Mao, truly reactionary to the extreme!

	The Poisonous Film "Stormy Waves" Sings Praises for the Dismissed Peng Dehuai
	Shī Hóng

	The poisonous film "Stormy Waves" blatantly advocates for the erroneous military line of opportunism, openly attacking Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with extremely malicious intentions.

	The film seems to depict the struggle between two lines from beginning to end. The special envoy Wang Huai Zhi is portrayed as the representative of the right-opportunist line, while Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin seem to be the representatives of the correct line. This is purely a deceptive trick. In fact, the struggle between Luo Dacheng, Qiu Jin, and Wang Huai Zhi is a struggle between erroneous lines, all of the same ilk. Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin initially had a close relationship with the Kuomintang warlord Yan Zishan, even flattering the reactionary officer Yan Zishan for his "righteousness in eliminating kin," harboring great illusions about the reactionaries. Isn't this the manifestation of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line? When the Kuomintang reactionaries openly betrayed, they fell from the right-opportunist extreme to the "left" opportunist extreme. Qiu Jin is a hot-headed adventurist. He single-handedly, hacking and killing indiscriminately, heard that his mother was captured by the local bully Liu Ruifu, and was so angry that his eyes flashed with gold stars, grabbing an axe to fight to the death. He was purely driven by a vengeful emotion, blindly attacking the towns.

	The film, under the banner of criticizing erroneous lines, is actually singing praises for the erroneous line. The film extensively depicts the activities of Qiu Jin and others blindly attacking towns after the "March 21 Incident," disregarding the specific conditions of enemy strength and our weakness. At that time, after Qiu Jin and others obtained the weapons of a Kuomintang platoon, they boasted, "Now we have more people and more guns," and decided to immediately attack the local bullies and evil gentry at Liujiatou; later, hearing that "the city is empty," they immediately took the risk to attack the city. The film's directors not only do not criticize this "left" adventurism but even beautify it, writing that they "achieved success," won a "victory" in one go, and even sing praises:

	"The sun comes out with a little red, the Yangtze River leaps up with a dragon, a strong and powerful force, causing the southern mountains to turn red" and so on, trying to depict adventurism as the correct line.

	The film distorts history, openly beautifying Peng Dehuai's opportunist line in the Pingjiang area at that time. This is singing praises for the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai, who was dismissed from office, and is a fierce attack on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

	With the golden monkey wielding the thousand-catty rod, the sky will be clear of all dust. Let us sweep the reactionary film "Stormy Waves" and all opportunists into the dustbin of history!

    反动影片《怒潮》借渔鼓老人之口唱出来的两支插曲，是射向党和毛主席的两支毒箭。
    一支毒箭：渔鼓老人用低沉的调子唱什么“昔日猛虎去学道，虎在深山乍遇猫，猫儿对虎把道教，猛虎得道反咬猫”。这是极其隐晦的黑话。这支插曲表面上是写国民党反动派的背叛，但实际上是咒骂党“忘恩负义”，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀喊冤叫屈，鸣不平。曲中影射彭德怀是教“虎”学道的“猫”，而今天“虎”得了“道”却反咬“猫”，把矛头直指在庐山会议上罢了彭德怀官的以毛主席为首的党中央，其用心何其毒也！彭德怀在替自己翻案时曾狂妄地叫嚣什么，我是“一半对一半，有错误，也有功劳”；又说：“主席讲话太过分了”，“我怎能接受得了呢？”这支黑曲子同彭德怀唱的是一个调子，正是为彭德怀喊冤叫屈，并鼓励他猖狂反扑的。
    另一支毒箭：影片里邱金在为被罢了官的罗大成送行的路上，渔鼓老人用悲愤的心情唱什么“送君送到大路旁，君的恩情永不忘，农友乡亲心里亮，隔山隔水永相望。”这支黑曲子，不正同《海瑞罢官》里捏造的那个“清官”海瑞被摘掉“乌纱帽”之后，群众送行时高唱“海青天”如出一辙吗？还有什么“哪有利剑能劈水，哪有利刀能斩愁”，“风里浪里你行船，我持梭标望君还”。这是明目张胆地煽动一小撮被罢官的右倾机会主义分子，不要忘记他们的“仇”和“恨”，要他们拿起武器再干，准备有朝一日，彭德怀在“风里浪里”把他的反革命破“船”划回，好接着干他们资本主义复辟的罪恶勾当。
    我们一定要高举革命大批判的旗帜，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，拔掉这两支毒箭，把反革命修正主义分子彭德怀和为他翻案的反动影片《怒潮》砸个稀巴烂！
　　不许美化机会主义路线
　　辛任立
    中国革命是走农村包围城市的道路，还是走相反的道路？这个问题，本来历史早就作了结论。中国赫鲁晓夫却包藏祸心地说：“革命的胜利，是从城市到农村，还是从农村到城市，其结果都是一样，这不是原则问题。”他公然篡改中国革命的历史，攻击毛主席的革命路线。主令仆从，中国赫鲁晓夫的一些奴才，纷纷而起，大肆美化机会主义路线。反动影片《怒潮》就是这样一株恶毒地攻击毛主席的革命路线，美化“左”倾机会主义路线，为反党篡军的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀树碑立传的大毒草。
    影片《怒潮》描写的是一九二七年“马日事变”后平江的革命斗争。当时毛主席亲自领导了修水、浏阳、平江、萍乡一带的工农武装，举行了秋收起义，并向井冈山进军，建立了革命根据地，开创了中国革命由农村包围城市的正确道路。但是影片却歌颂彭德怀之流当时在平江执行的一味攻打城市的“左”倾机会主义路线，大肆描写“扑城”之役的胜利。影片把本来失败了的“扑城”，大肆渲染成“激动人心的胜利场面”，妄图使人相信：这条盲动主义的路线是使中国革命成功的道路。这是公然对毛主席提出的中国革命“不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路”的无产阶级革命路线的恶毒攻击！
    更加恶毒的是，影片的炮制者还把“左”倾机会主义的攻打城市的冒险命令，强加在毛主席的头上，硬说成是毛主席的“来信指示”。他们捏造了这样一个情节：苏大嫂带来一封所谓毛主席的“回信”，促使了罗大成、邱金一哄而起，盲目攻城。这完全是颠倒黑白，混淆是非，把攻击的矛头直接对着毛主席，真是反动透顶！
　　反动影片《怒潮》为罢了官的彭德怀唱赞歌
　　师红
    毒草影片《怒潮》露骨地宣扬机会主义的错误军事路线，公然攻击毛主席的革命路线，其用心恶毒之极。
    影片似乎从始至终都在表现两条路线的斗争。特派员王怀志被描写为右倾机会主义路线的代表，而罗大成、邱金则好象是正确路线的代表。这纯粹是骗人的鬼花招。其实罗大成、邱金和王怀志的斗争，是用错误路线反对错误路线，都是一路货色。罗大成、邱金开始也和国民党军阀阎紫剑亲同手足，甚至还肉麻地吹捧反动军官阎紫剑能大义灭亲，对反动派存在莫大的幻想。这不正是陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的表现吗？等到国民党反动派公开叛变，他们又从右倾机会主义这一个极端跌到了“左”倾机会主义另一个极端。邱金就是一个头脑发热的冒险主义者。他单枪匹马，乱砍乱杀，一听到母亲被土豪刘瑞甫抓去，就气得眼冒金星，拿把柴刀硬拚。他就是单纯带着复仇情绪盲目地去攻打城镇的。
    影片打着批判错误路线的招牌，实际上在为错误路线唱赞歌。影片大写特写“马日事变”以后，邱金等人不顾敌强我弱的具体条件盲目攻打城镇的活动。当时邱金等人在搞到国民党一个班的武装之后，就吹嘘“现在我们枪多人多”，“当机立断”，马上去打土豪劣绅盘踞的刘家桥；以后听说“城内空虚”，又立刻冒险进攻。影片编导者对于这种“左”倾盲动主义不但不加批判，反而加以美化，写他们“马到成功”，一举而得“胜利”，并且还大唱赞歌：
  “太阳出来一点红，大江跃起一条龙，一支人马强又壮，闹得南山一片红”等等，极力把盲动主义描绘成正确的路线。
    影片歪曲历史，公然美化彭德怀当时在平江地区所执行的机会主义路线，这是为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀唱赞歌，这是对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的猖狂进攻。
    金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。让我们把反动影片《怒潮》和一切机会主义分子，统统扫进历史的垃圾堆里去吧！
