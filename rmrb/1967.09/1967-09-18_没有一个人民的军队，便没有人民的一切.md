Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people. Combat hero Zha Shunyì.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the revolutionary people's guns. Shortly after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he raised the banner of "peaceful democratic new stage," demanding that the people hand over their guns to Chiang Kai-shek. He absurdly claimed that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle," and "non-military struggle should be the main form." He also vigorously advocated for "reorganizing the army, turning our army into the national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense corps," and so on. In short, he wanted us to surrender the people's weapons. Chairman Mao had long taught us: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our army maintained a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, developed and strengthened the people's armed forces, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's highest directive to "preserve every gun and bullet of the people's weapons and not hand them over." We smashed the Chinese Khrushchev's thoroughly capitulationist counter-revolutionary line and engaged in a head-on struggle with Chiang Kai-shek, using revolutionary weapons to oppose counter-revolutionary weapons, liberating all of China. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line over the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, the victory of the workers and peasants' children with their guns, and the brilliant victory of the proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"!

In the past, seizing power was inseparable from the people's army; today, defending power is also inseparable from the people's army. Losing the people's army means losing the people's power; changing the nature of the people's army means changing the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Although the Chinese Khrushchev's historical line of surrendering weapons has failed, he is still not reconciled. After liberation, he attempted to alter the nature of our army through his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. The most fundamental point is his opposition to the entire army carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They vigorously promoted cultural and technical studies, emphasizing military first, technology first, using technology to undermine politics, and opposing the building of our army with Mao Zedong Thought. They imported a set of foreign revisionist practices, advocating for regularization and rank systems to alienate the soldier-civilian relationship. In short, their evil goal of altering the nature of our army is to seize military power and implement capitalist restoration. Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms and our deputy commander, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, exposed the evil plots of Peng and Luo, and took a series of major measures to formulate a series of principles and policies that emphasize proletarian politics, maintaining our army's unlimited loyalty to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. Our army has become an invincible people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Our Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has in the past tightly grasped the gun to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule; today, it tightly grasps the gun to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and support world revolution.

    没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切	战斗英雄　郅顺义
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯地反对革命人民的枪杆子。抗日战争胜利不久，他就打起“和平民主新阶段”的破旗，要人民把枪杆子交给蒋介石，胡说什么“中国革命主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”，“以非武装斗争为主”。他还竭力主张“军队也要整编，我们的军队成为国军、国防军、保安军、自卫队”等等。一句话，就是要我们交出人民的武装。毛主席早就教导我们说：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”在毛主席的英明领导下，我军保持了高度的革命警惕性，发展壮大了人民的武装力量，坚决执行了毛主席的“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去”的最高指示，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫彻底投降主义的反革命路线；又与蒋介石展开了针锋相对的斗争，以革命的武装反对反革命的武装，解放了全中国。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，就是毛主席的革命路线与中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线斗争的胜利，就是工农子弟兵用枪杆子打出来的胜利，也就是“枪杆子里面出政权”这一英明论断的光辉胜利！
    过去，夺取政权离不开人民的军队；今天，保卫政权也离不开人民的军队。失去了人民的军队，就失去了人民的政权；改变了人民军队的性质，就改变了无产阶级专政的性质。中国赫鲁晓夫虽然在历史上交枪投降的反动路线破了产，但仍不死心，解放后，他通过在军队里的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，极力妄图篡改我军的性质。其中最根本的一点，就是反对全军开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们大搞文化技术学习，大搞军事第一，技术第一，用技术来冲击政治，反对用毛泽东思想建设我军。他们大搬外国修正主义的一套，搞什么正规化、军衔制来疏远军民的鱼水关系。总之，他们妄图改变我军性质的罪恶目的，就是为了篡夺军权，实行资本主义复辟。毛主席的亲密战友、我们的副统帅林彪同志，坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，揭穿了彭、罗的罪恶阴谋，进行了坚决的抵制和斗争，采取了一系列的重大措施，制定了一系列突出无产阶级政治的原则和方针，保持了我军无限忠于人民，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想的革命本质，使我军成为一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、无敌于天下的人民的军队。
    我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，过去，紧紧握住枪杆子，推翻了蒋介石的反动统治；今天，紧紧握住枪杆子，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政，支援世界革命。
