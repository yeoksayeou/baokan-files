Revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University and soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army executing military training tasks have formulated "Military Support Pacts" and "Civilian Love Pacts" respectively.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 31st, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University and soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army executing military training tasks have, in the midst of a thriving and expanding military support and civilian love movement, formulated "Military Support Pacts" and "Civilian Love Pacts" respectively, in accordance with the new characteristics of the school's criticism movement and the specific circumstances of various tasks. This has pushed the "Military Support and Civilian Love" movement to new heights, sounding a new battle cry for the thorough destruction of the bourgeois headquarters.

In the process of formulating the "Military Support Pacts" and "Civilian Love Pacts," the broad revolutionary teachers, students, staff, and soldiers and officers unanimously believe that the process of formulating the pacts is a process of studying Chairman Mao's works, studying Chairman Mao's great call for "Military Support and Civilian Love," deeply understanding the great strategic significance of "Military Support and Civilian Love," a process of summarizing military support and civilian love experiences and lessons, a process of praising advanced figures in military support and civilian love, finding weak links in military support and civilian love, and improving military support and civilian love work, and a process of further deepening and popularizing military support and civilian love education. They say: Only such pacts can truly be imprinted in the mind and implemented in action.

In order to make the military support and civilian love movement develop vigorously and make the military support pacts practical and feasible, the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Normal University held a mobilization meeting, calling on all teachers, students, and staff to seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on "Military Support and Civilian Love," deeply understand the great strategic significance of "Military Support and Civilian Love," and launch a new high tide of learning from the People's Liberation Army. They should also, based on the specific circumstances of their school, department, and class, formulate "Military Support Pacts" in a solid and practical manner. In recent days, various departments and classes have held discussions with the People's Liberation Army, inviting soldiers and officers to share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and their experiences in emphasizing politics and grasping living thoughts. They have actively sought opinions from soldiers and officers on improving work and accelerating the transformation of their worldview. Some departments and classes have also conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on what to learn from the People's Liberation Army and how to learn from them. The Revolutionary Committee of the Foreign Languages Department, based on the needs of the Cultural Revolution and the actual situation of the students, used the People's Liberation Army's experience of "Two Remembrances and Three Inspections" to carry out a new "Two Remembrances and Three Inspections" activity, focusing on remembering class bitterness, remembering the bitterness of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, inspecting the study of Chairman Mao's works, inspecting performance in the great criticism, and inspecting new revolutionary fighting spirit. This has made the military support activities lively and vivid, and the "Military Support Pacts" solid and practical.

In recent days, soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison executing military training tasks at Beijing Normal University have, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "the army must blend with the people, so that the army is seen by the people as their own army, and this army will be invincible in the world," repeatedly understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's call for "Military Support and Civilian Love" in the process of formulating the "Civilian Love Pacts." They regard the process of formulating the "Civilian Love Pacts" as a process of learning from revolutionary youngsters, raising proletarian awareness, and preparing to achieve new merits for the people. Many soldiers and officers have actively sought the opinions of revolutionary youngsters, conducted open rectification, and found weak links. Some soldiers and officers have also carried out activities to learn from revolutionary youngsters, sharing their experiences and insights on learning from revolutionary youngsters. The "Civilian Love Pacts" they have initially formulated are relatively practical and solid.

　　以毛泽东思想为指针订好拥军爱民公约
　　北师大革命师生和执行军训任务的解放军指战员，分别制定“拥军公约”和“爱民公约”
    据新华社三十一日讯　北京师范大学革命师生和正在执行军训任务的解放军某部指战员，在蓬勃发展的更大规模的拥军爱民运动中，针对学校大批判运动逐步深入的新特点和各项工作的具体情况，正在分别制定“拥军公约”和“爱民公约”，把“拥军爱民”运动推向了新的高峰，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部吹响了新的战斗号角。
    在制定“拥军公约”和“爱民公约”的活动中，广大革命师生员工和部队指战员一致认为：制定公约的过程，是学习毛主席著作、学习毛主席发出的“拥军爱民”伟大号召，深刻理解“拥军爱民”的伟大战略意义的过程，是群众性的总结拥军爱民经验教训的过程，是表扬拥军爱民先进人物、寻找拥军爱民薄弱环节并据以改进拥军爱民工作的过程，是一次更加深入、更加普及拥军爱民教育的过程。他们说：这样订出来的公约，才能真正印在脑子里，落实在行动上。
    为了使拥军爱民运动开展得轰轰烈烈，使拥军公约订得切实可行，北京师范大学革命委员会，召开了动员大会，号召全体师生员工，认真学习毛主席有关“拥军爱民”的指示，深刻理解“拥军爱民”的伟大战略意义，深入开展向解放军学习的新高潮，并要根据本校、本系、本班的具体情况，扎扎实实地订出“拥军公约”。这几天，各系、班，纷纷与解放军一起举行座谈会，请指战员介绍活学活用毛主席著作的体会和突出政治、抓活思想的经验，主动地向指战员们征求改进工作，加速改造世界观的意见。有些系、班还围绕着向解放军学习什么和怎样学习等，展开了广泛而深入的讨论。外语系革命委员会根据文化大革命发展形势的需要和同学们的实际情况，运用解放军“两忆三查”的经验，开展了忆阶级苦、忆受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，查学习毛主席著作的情况、查大批判中的表现、查革命斗志的新的“两忆三查”活动，把拥军活动开展得生动活泼，把“拥军公约”订得扎扎实实。
    在北京师范大学执行军训任务的北京部队某部指战员，这几天，根据毛主席“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”的教导，在制定“爱民公约”过程中，反复领会毛主席“拥军爱民”号召的伟大意义。他们把制定“爱民公约”的过程，作为向革命小将学习、提高无产阶级觉悟，准备为人民大立新功的过程。许多指战员主动征求革命小将的意见，进行开门整风，狠找薄弱环节；还有的指战员开展了向革命小将学习的活动，畅谈了向革命小将学习的心得体会。他们初步制定出来的“爱民公约”都比较切合实际，扎扎实实。
