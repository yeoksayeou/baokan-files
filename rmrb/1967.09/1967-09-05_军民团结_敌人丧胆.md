The current situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is extremely favorable. The tide of revolutionary criticism is surging forward, and the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev is on the verge of complete collapse. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are being drowned in the vast ocean of criticism from hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

At this crucial moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has issued an extremely important battle command. We, the revolutionary faction of the Beijing Military District, enthusiastically respond to and resolutely carry out this command.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is a great revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our People's Liberation Army is the great wall of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses" has given our army a glorious and arduous task. We must hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," resolutely support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and be their steadfast rear guard.

The broad revolutionary faction of the proletariat, tempered in the stormy waves of the Cultural Revolution, are the most loyal executors and bravest defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They represent the revolutionary will of the broad masses of the people and the direction of social progress. We resolutely support all their revolutionary actions and vow to share their breath, fate, and tightly unite with them to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev and fight shoulder to shoulder to the end.

"Enemies will not disappear on their own. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." All class enemies are most afraid of the unity between the military and the civilians, and therefore they always try to sabotage this unity. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and guard against class enemies stirring up trouble and taking advantage of the chaos. We must firmly suppress those who engage in sabotage activities, such as American and KMT spies, Soviet revisionist spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Only in this way can we ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution goes all the way and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　军民团结　敌人丧胆
　　北京部队机关无产阶级革命派
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，革命大批判的洪流汹涌澎湃，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部正在走向全面崩溃，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，陷入了亿万工农兵群众口诛笔伐的汪洋大海之中。
    在这无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部又发出了极为重要的战斗号令。我们北京部队机关无产阶级革命派，最热烈地响应、最坚决地执行。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是在无产阶级专政条件下的大革命。我们解放军是无产阶级专政的伟大长城。毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大教导，给我军提出了光荣而艰巨的任务。我们一定要更加高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，誓作他们的坚强后盾。
    在文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中锻炼成长起来的广大无产阶级革命派，是毛主席革命路线的最忠实的执行者和最勇敢的捍卫者。他们代表着广大人民群众的革命意志，代表着社会前进的方向。我们坚决支持他们的一切革命行动，誓和他们同呼吸，共命运，紧密团结，为彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，并肩战斗到底。
    “敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”一切阶级敌人最害怕军民团结，因此他们总是力图破坏这个团结。我们必须保持高度的革命警惕，严防阶级敌人挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。对那些搞破坏活动的美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右分子，要坚决镇压。只有这样，才能保障无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
