Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Sato Eisaku blatantly carried out the orders of his American imperialist master, brazenly invading our sacred territory of Taiwan today. This is the Sato government's active role as an accomplice to U.S. and Soviet anti-China aggression, brazenly engaging in crazy political provocation against the Chinese people, and is a serious crime of direct interference in our domestic affairs.

According to a message from Taipei by the Associated Press today, Sato was "welcomed" by the "Vice President" of the Kuomintang bandit group, Yen Chia-kan, at the Taipei Songshan Airport. During his stay in Taiwan, he will have two "meetings" with the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. The message revealed that after his "visit" to some countries and regions in Southeast Asia, Sato will go to the United States to report to the war-monger Johnson.

The plan for Sato, the running dog of American imperialism, to go to Taiwan for conspiracy activities was decided when the head of the Soviet revisionists, Kosygin, paid a visit to the head of American imperialism, Johnson, and engaged in a global counter-revolutionary conspiracy and great betrayal. According to reports, Sato's visit to Taiwan is inseparable from the hastening of the "Northeast Asia Military Alliance." The Sato reactionary government follows American imperialism and deliberately makes an enemy of the Chinese people. In his written statement at the Taipei Songshan Airport today, he openly shouted that Japan and the Kuomintang bandits should "maintain close and friendly relations" and expressed his willingness to have an "open and frank discussion" on matters of "common concern."

Since Sato took office, he has acted as a henchman for American imperialism, hastening the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He and his accomplices have been frantically shouting that "Taiwan's status is undetermined" and absurdly claiming that Taiwan is Japan's "buffer zone." All of this nakedly exposes the wolfish ambitions of Japanese militarism to reoccupy Chinese territory in Taiwan and to relive the illusory dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the American monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be hanged by the people of the whole world. Other American accomplices will also meet the same fate." The Sato reactionary government, willingly serving as the biggest accomplice of American imperialism in Asia, wholeheartedly serving its American master's policy of aggression and war, will ultimately perish along with American imperialism.

### 积极充当美苏反华帮凶　明目张胆制造“两个中国”　佐藤窜入我神圣领土台湾进行挑衅

　　积极充当美苏反华帮凶　明目张胆制造“两个中国”
　　佐藤窜入我神圣领土台湾进行挑衅
    据新华社七日讯　日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作公然秉承他主子美帝国主义的意旨，在今天猖狂地窜入我国神圣领土台湾。这是佐藤政府积极充当美苏反华帮凶、明目张胆地对中国人民进行疯狂政治挑衅，是佐藤政府直接干涉我国内政的严重罪行。
    据美联社今天从台北发出的消息说，佐藤在台北松山机场上受到了蒋匪帮“副总统”严家淦的“欢迎”。他在台湾期间，将同匪首蒋介石进行两次“会谈”。消息透露，佐藤在“访问”东南亚一些地区和国家后，将前往美国向战争贩子约翰逊汇报。
    美帝国主义的走狗佐藤到台湾进行阴谋活动计划，早在苏修头目柯西金朝拜美帝头子约翰逊，大搞全球性反革命大勾结、大叛卖的时候就定下来了。据报道，佐藤这次到台湾，是同加紧拼凑“东北亚军事同盟”分不开的。佐藤反动政府追随美帝国主义，蓄意与中国人民为敌。他今天在台北松山机场发表书面谈话时，公然叫嚷日本与蒋匪帮之间“彼此保持密切亲近的关系”，还表示要对他们“共同关切的事项，开诚畅谈”。
    佐藤上台伊始，就充当美帝国主义的打手，加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他和他的同伙疯狂地叫嚣“台湾归属未定”，胡说什么台湾是日本的“防波堤”。这一切，赤裸裸地暴露了日本军国主义妄图重新霸占中国领土台湾和重温“大东亚共荣圈”黄粱美梦的狼子野心。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”佐藤反动政府，甘心充当美帝国主义在亚洲的最大帮凶，死心塌地为其美国主子的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，到头来，只能替美帝国主义殉葬。
