Implementing the "Revolution and Production" Policy, Foiling the Sabotage Plots of Class Enemies

The Da Shiqiao Magnesium Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, represented by the "Anshan Steel Defending Mao Zedong Thought Battle Headquarters," with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, has resolutely implemented the great policy of "Revolution and Production." They have successfully completed the national production plan for the first eight months of this year.

Over the past eight months, the main products of this mine have exceeded the national production plan by 2% to 5%. The variety of products has significantly increased, with 34 more varieties of magnesia bricks compared to last year. The rate of first-class products has increased by more than 14%, and the consumption of raw materials and fuel has also been reduced compared to last year.

In late January of this year, a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, responding to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," entered the Da Shiqiao Magnesium Mine of Anshan Steel to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party were pushing the bourgeois reactionary line in the mine, inciting the masses to fight against each other and against cadres, which affected production. Facing this situation, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, remembering Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should strongly assist the local areas and support industrial production work, decided to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the Da Shiqiao Magnesium Mine. After arriving at the mine, they, with the attitude of being willing to be small students, conducted a comprehensive investigation and research among the masses. They discovered that a combat team of more than ten people in the magnesia brick workshop criticized the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his agent in Anshan Steel for pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, destroying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and committing heinous crimes against production. This approach was highly praised by the masses, so they actively supported and promoted it, launching a revolutionary criticism throughout the mine. Through the criticism, the political awareness of the masses was greatly enhanced. Batch after batch of people emerged from the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the leftist forces rapidly expanded, with both revolution and production showing a very good situation.

However, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party were not willing to give up. They used more vicious means to sabotage the cultural revolution and production in the magnesium mine. By the end of April, they used various tricks to make things difficult for revolutionary workers in production, attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great policy of "Revolution and Production." The proletarian revolutionary forces of the magnesium mine, who had emerged from the persecution of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Anshan Steel Party, were tough in revolution and daring in production. When they did not provide raw materials, the workers on one hand practiced thrift and on the other hand sought help from sister units; when they did not provide machinery and equipment, the workers made and repaired them themselves. Every time a piece of machinery was made, they held a revealing criticism meeting; every time a machine was repaired, they held a criticism meeting. They advanced in the face of numerous difficulties, exceeding the national production plan every month.

In late May, the mine was hit by floods and hail. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and intense hatred for the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, worked together with all their might and perseverance. They finally overcame the floods and fully exceeded the national production plan for May.

    贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针，粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋
    大石桥镁矿出色完成头八个月生产计划
    主要产品超额完成国家计划，产品品种大幅度增加，一级品率提高百分之十四以上，原料、燃料消耗比去年降低
    据新华社沈阳十二日电　鞍山钢铁公司大石桥镁矿以“鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部”为代表的无产阶级革命派，在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，出色地完成了今年头八个月的国家生产计划。
    八个月来，这个矿的主要产品分别超额百分之二到百分之五完成了国家生产计划。产品品种大幅度增加，其中镁砖品种比去年增加了三十四种，一级品率提高百分之十四以上，原料、燃料消耗也比去年有所降低。
    今年一月下旬，解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，进驻鞍钢大石桥镁矿宣传毛泽东思想。当时鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在矿里推行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，挑动群众斗干部，使生产受到影响。面对这种情况，毛泽东思想宣传队牢记毛主席和党中央关于人民解放军要大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作的指示，决心以毛泽东思想武装群众，在大石桥镁矿大树毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。他们来矿后，就以甘当小学生的态度深入到群众中去全面调查研究。他们发现镁砖车间一个十多人的战斗队批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他在鞍钢的代理人推行资产阶级反动路线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，被坏生产的滔天罪行的做法，很受群众好评，就积极支持，并且加以推广，在全矿展开革命的大批判。通过大批判，群众政治觉悟大大提高，一批又一批群众从资产阶级反动路线的毒害中杀了出来，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，左派队伍迅速壮大，革命和生产出现一派大好形势。
    但是鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派贼心不死，他们破坏镁矿文化大革命和生产，一招不成又来一招。四月底，他们以更加毒辣的手段在生产上百般刁难革命工人，妄图破坏毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。从鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的迫害下杀出来的镁矿无产阶级革命派，在革命中是硬汉子，在生产上是闯将。不给原料，工人一方面搞节约，一方面向兄弟单位求援；不给机件设备，工人自己造，自己修。每造出一种机件，开一次揭露批判会；每修好一台机器，开一次批判会。他们迎着重重困难前进，月月超额完成国家生产计划。
    五月下旬，这个矿遭到洪水、冰雹的袭击。广大军民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派无比愤恨，同心协力，实干苦干，终于战胜了洪水，全面超额完成了五月份国家生产计划。
