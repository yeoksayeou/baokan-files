Wherever Chairman Mao Points, We Rush There!

Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters

Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao recently inspected the North China, Central China, and East China regions, investigated the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and gave important instructions. This great piece of news, like a spring thunder, shook the earth. The news spread, and the whole country rejoiced.

Under Chairman Mao's intimate care, our Shanghai proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved extremely great victories, and the situation is getting better and better. At this unprecedentedly good juncture, at this crucial moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, Chairman Mao personally came to Shanghai to inspect, which is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for the Shanghai working class and the revolutionary masses of the whole city; it inspires us to be even more confident and even more enthusiastic in fighting new battles and seizing new victories!

Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat in our time. At every important juncture in the victory and development of the proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is always Chairman Mao who personally steers the course for us proletarian revolutionaries and points out the way forward. Chairman Mao recently gave us important instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." It is under the great encouragement of this latest instruction from our great leader Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, that the wind of revolutionary unity quickly swept across Shanghai and across the whole country, forming an irresistible great historical trend, powerfully smashing the plots of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and fiercely striking against bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and continuously strengthen and develop revolutionary unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. Units that have already achieved revolutionary unity must further use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to constantly overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, using proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and truly unite in thought. A few units that have not yet achieved revolutionary unity must act decisively and quickly achieve revolutionary unity. Only by truly uniting in thought can there be a reliable basis for organizational unity. Only by truly uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought can we complete the great historical mission given to us by the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We must unite in battle and fight unitedly. Raise higher the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism led by Chairman Mao, with the work team as the base, extensively and deeply improve the level of revolutionary criticism, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev, making them never be able to rise again!

We must combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our own units, thoroughly purge the poison spread by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev on the industrial and transportation front, uproot the source of revisionism, and truly turn industrial and transportation enterprises into strong fortresses of socialism and into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought!

We must, on the basis of achieving revolutionary unity, with a responsible attitude towards the proletarian revolutionary cause, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," boldly use revolutionary cadres, and quickly achieve revolutionary "three-in-one combination," firmly grasping the reins in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries.

We must shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, grasp revolution firmly, promote production vigorously, put forth great efforts, strive to be the best, and greatly promote the further development of industrial and transportation undertakings!

    毛主席指向那里，我们就奔向那里！
　　上海工人革命造反总司令部
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，最近视察了华北、中南、华东地区，调查了河南、湖北、湖南、江西、浙江、上海等省市文化大革命的情况，并作了重要指示。这个特大的喜讯，象一声春雷，震撼大地。喜讯传开，全国欢腾。
    在毛主席的亲切关怀下，我们上海的无产阶级文化大革命取得了极其伟大的胜利，形势越来越好。在这空前大好的形势下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，毛主席亲自来到上海视察，这是对我们上海工人阶级和全市无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策；激励我们更加信心百倍、更加斗志昂扬地去进行新的战斗，去夺取新的胜利！
    毛主席是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家。在无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的每一个重要关头，总是毛主席他老人家亲自为我们无产阶级革命派拨正航向，指明前进的道路。毛主席最近向我们发出了重要的指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”正是在伟大领袖毛主席这一最新指示的巨大鼓舞下，在光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的指引下，革命大联合的东风迅速吹遍全上海，吹遍全中国，形成不可抗拒的伟大的历史潮流，最有力地粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计，最猛烈地冲击了资产阶级思想和小资产阶级派性。
    我们一定坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断加强和发展在毛泽东思想原则基础上的革命大联合。已经实现大联合的单位，要进一步以毛泽东思想为武器，不断破私立公，用无产阶级的党性克服小资产阶级的派性，真正从思想上联合起来。还没有实现革命大联合的少数单位，要最坚决地行动起来，迅速实现革命的大联合。只有在思想上真正联合起来，组织上的联合才有可靠的基础。只有真正在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，才能完成无产阶级文化大革命给予我们工人阶级的伟大历史使命。
    我们一定要在战斗中联合，联合起来战斗。更高地举起毛主席的无产阶级的革命批判的旗帜，以班组为基础，广泛深入地提高革命大批判的水平，集中火力，集中目标，从政治、思想、理论上把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！
    我们一定要把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，彻底肃清以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在工业交通战线散布的流毒，挖掉产生修正主义的根子，真正把工业交通企业办成社会主义的坚强堡垒，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
    我们一定要在实现革命大联合的基础上，以对无产阶级革命事业负责的态度，坚决遵循毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，大胆使用革命干部，尽速实现革命的“三结合”，把印把子牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里。
    我们一定要挑起革命和生产的两副重担，狠抓革命，猛促生产，鼓足干劲，力争上游，大力促进工交事业的更大发展！
