The people's armed forces in Quang Ngai Province of South Vietnam have reported another victory. In an eight-day battle from August 2 to 9, they successfully repelled a large-scale "sweeping" operation launched by U.S. and puppet forces, along with South Korean mercenaries. Simultaneously, they conducted deep strikes into enemy territory, continuously attacking enemy strongholds. In these battles, they annihilated nearly a thousand enemy troops, including nearly 300 U.S. invaders. They also shot down 14 enemy aircraft, destroyed one fuel depot and one ammunition depot, demolished numerous barracks, sank or damaged 12 patrol boats, and seized a large amount of ammunition and military supplies.

During this heroic anti-"sweeping" battle, the liberation armed forces fought many brilliant battles. In the counterattack in the western regions of Tuy Hoa and Son Ha counties, the liberation armed forces annihilated over 420 U.S. and puppet troops and South Korean mercenaries, and destroyed two M-113 type armored vehicles. On the 9th, the liberation armed forces attacked the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division's 2nd Brigade stationed in the Da Nang area, annihilating nearly 160 enemy troops, including an entire company of U.S. troops, and shot down 11 enemy aircraft.

On the east side of Highway 1, when the enemy left their nests to conduct "sweeping" operations, the liberation armed forces took the opportunity to launch a fierce assault on the enemy's defensive lines. They successfully leveled six enemy strongholds, annihilating hundreds of U.S. and puppet troops.
