The revolutionary masses of Shanghai Transport Company No. 9, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, held study classes on Chairman Mao's works, actively applying Mao Zedong Thought, overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. They quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

This unit has twelve revolutionary mass organizations. Due to some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations not thoroughly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, petty-bourgeois factionalism has grown, focusing on minor issues and attacking each other, making it difficult to achieve revolutionary great unity for a long time. The PLA support-leftist comrades, after careful investigation and research, found that the general direction of these revolutionary mass organizations is consistent. However, some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations do not distinguish between the two types of contradictions, some are influenced by personal interests, and some focus more on the shortcomings and errors of others, leading to increasingly intense "internal strife."

In this situation, how can revolutionary great unity be achieved? The PLA comrades deeply felt that it is necessary to strongly emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, raise the awareness of the revolutionary masses, and first help the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations to improve their understanding, making them the backbone of promoting great unity. The PLA comrades helped the revolutionary masses to establish study classes on Chairman Mao's works, gathering more than 120 key members from all revolutionary mass organizations in the company for periodic rotations to study.

The study classes adopted a method of self-education, self-criticism, and praise and encouragement. After two sessions, many leaders of the revolutionary organizations realized that only by achieving revolutionary great unity can the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party be maximally isolated and thoroughly overthrown.

With a unified ideology and the desire for great unity, the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations went to do ideological and political work among the members. They organized the revolutionary masses to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Two previously opposed revolutionary organizations, after studying, had a unified understanding and jointly wrote a big-character poster titled "Resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, eliminate differences, and unite against the enemy." Upon returning to their teams, they studied Chairman Mao's works with the members, unified their thoughts, and achieved revolutionary great unity within the team in just three days.

At the beginning of the study classes on Chairman Mao's works, some comrades thought this was an opportunity to expand their influence and defeat the opposition. With the help of the PLA comrades, everyone studied Mao Zedong's teachings on criticism and self-criticism. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations launched a campaign of self-criticism, gradually eliminating misunderstandings. Those who originally prepared to defeat the opposition sincerely opened their hearts and voluntarily made self-criticisms.

After studying Mao Zedong's instructions on considering the overall situation, the comrades of various revolutionary organizations also realized that the proletarian revolutionary masses should always consider the overall situation. The current overall situation is to carry out revolutionary criticism according to Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and absolutely not to settle old scores among revolutionary mass organizations. They must abandon individualism and groupism, achieve revolutionary great unity. Once they considered this, many differences of opinion were eliminated. Soon, the twelve revolutionary organizations in the company reached a consensus and quickly established a unified revolutionary organization—the Shanghai Transport Company No. 9 Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps. Based on Mao Zedong Thought, they achieved revolutionary great unity. They planned and acted in unison, concentrated their efforts, launched a new wave of revolutionary criticism, and effectively promoted production.

    毛泽东思想是革命大联合的灵魂
    解放军支左部队帮助上海运输九场举办毛主席著作学习班，促进革命派实现了大联合
    本报讯　上海运输九场无产阶级革命派，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，举办毛主席著作学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    这个单位有十二个革命群众组织。由于有些革命群众组织的负责人没有很好地活学活用毛主席著作，小资产阶级的派性有所滋长，彼此抓住一些枝节问题，互相攻击，长时期不能实现革命的大联合。来运输九场支左的解放军同志经过细致的调查研究，感到这些革命群众组织的大方向是一致的，但是有些革命群众组织负责人对两类不同性质的矛盾分不清，有的“私”字作怪，有的看对方的大方向少、看缺点错误多，因而“内战”越打越激烈。
    在这种情况下，怎样才能实现革命的大联合呢？解放军同志深深感到必须大力突出毛泽东思想，提高革命派的觉悟，而且首先要帮助革命群众组织负责人提高认识，使他们成为促进大联合的骨干。解放军同志帮助革命派成立了毛主席著作学习班，把全场革命群众组织的骨干一百二十多人集中起来，分期轮流学习。
    学习班采取了以自我教育为主、自我批评为主、表扬鼓励为主的学习方法。经过两期学习，许多革命组织负责人认识到，只有实现革命的大联合，才能够把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派最大限度地孤立起来，才能彻底把他们打倒。
    各革命群众组织的负责人有了统一的思想，有了大联合的愿望，就分别去做队员的思想政治工作。他们针对各种活思想组织革命群众活学活用毛主席著作。有两个原来对立得很厉害的革命组织的负责人，学习以后，思想认识一致了，共同写出“坚决听毛主席的话，消除分歧，团结对敌”的大字报。回到车队后，他们就和队员一起学习毛主席著作，统一了思想，结果三天内就实现了车队的革命大联合。
    在毛主席著作学习班上，开始的时候，有的同志以为这是扩大自己影响，把对方辩倒压服的好机会，带去了大批攻击对方的资料。在解放军同志帮助下，大家学习了毛主席有关批评和自我批评的论述。各革命群众组织负责人大兴自我批评之风，逐步消除了隔阂。那些原来准备辩倒压服对方的同志，在会上诚恳地交了心，主动作了检查。
    各革命组织的同志学习了毛主席有关顾全大局的指示以后，也认识到无产阶级革命派应该时刻胸怀全局。当前的全局就是按照毛主席的战略部署，进行革命的大批判，绝不能只在革命群众组织之间算旧账，一定要抛弃个人主义、小团体主义，实现革命的大联合。大家这样一考虑，许多分歧意见也就消除了。不久，全场十二个革命组织取得了一致协议，很快就成立了统一的革命组织——上海运输九场工人革命造反大队，在毛泽东思想基础上实现了革命大联合。他们统一计划，统一行动，集中力量，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，并且有力地推动了生产。
