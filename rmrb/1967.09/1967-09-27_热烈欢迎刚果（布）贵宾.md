The delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) and the government, led by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement, Prime Minister, and Head of Government, Alphonse Massemba-Débat, arrived in our capital today for a friendly visit and to celebrate the National Day with our people. The Chinese people warmly welcome the Congolese guests.

The peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) have always been mutually inspiring in their common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Congo (Brazzaville) in 1964, the friendly cooperation between the two countries has developed rapidly. We have signed economic and cultural cooperation agreements, and government and civilian delegations from both countries have frequently visited each other. In our joint struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, we have supported each other and made active contributions to the cause of Asian and African unity and anti-imperialism.

The people of Congo (Brazzaville) have a glorious revolutionary tradition. For nearly a century, they have bravely fought against colonial rule and oppression to win national independence. Congo (Brazzaville) declared independence in 1960. In 1963, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) rose up in rebellion, overthrowing the reactionary puppet regime in the famous "August Revolution." They then repeatedly struck down and crushed the interventions, invasions, subversions, and sabotage by imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys. Currently, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) are vigilantly safeguarding their national independence and continuously advancing their anti-imperialist revolutionary cause.

The struggle of the Congolese people is part of the broader struggle of the African people against imperialism and colonialism. Imperialism led by the United States is intensifying its neo-colonialism, attempting to plunder and enslave the peoples of African countries, and to destroy and extinguish national liberation movements. They seek to keep unliberated countries under their control forever and to turn already independent countries back into their colonies. These arrogant attempts will certainly be crushed by the African people. Currently, the entire African continent is in the midst of a wave of resistance against imperialism and colonialism, and the anti-imperialist struggle is in a favorable position. More and more African people are awakening, taking up arms, and joining the armed struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. Africa belongs to the African people. The African people will ultimately drive out all imperialist and old and new colonialist forces from Africa.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out when receiving African friends: "We must strengthen our unity and jointly oppose imperialism, colonialism, and their lackeys, and struggle for complete and thorough national independence and liberation."

The friendly cooperation between China and Congo (Brazzaville) and the friendship between our peoples have deep foundations. We have united in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and in the principles of mutual respect and mutual support. As long as the Asian and African peoples and the peoples of the world unite, form a broad international anti-American united front, and engage in unyielding struggle, we will certainly achieve victory in the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of all peoples.

At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved brilliant victories, the Congolese guests have come to our midst. We are very pleased to see that the Congolese people enthusiastically praise our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is an encouragement and support for our people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt thanks.

We believe that the visit of the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and the government of Congo (Brazzaville) will further enhance the friendship between our two peoples and promote the friendly cooperation between our two countries. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the great struggle of the Congolese people to oppose imperialism and colonialism, consolidate national independence, and safeguard state sovereignty. Let us, the peoples of the two countries, advance shoulder to shoulder in our common struggle against imperialism!

### 热烈欢迎刚果（布）贵宾

　　热烈欢迎刚果（布）贵宾
    刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团在刚果（布）全国革命运动中央委员会第一书记、总理、政府首脑努马扎莱的率领下，今天来到我国首都，进行友好访问，并同我国人民一起欢度国庆佳节。中国人民对刚果（布）贵宾的到来，表示热烈的欢迎。
    中国和刚果（布）两国人民，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中，一直是相互鼓舞的。一九六四年中国和刚果（布）建交以后，两国的友好合作关系得到了迅速的发展。我们两国签订了经济合作和文化合作协定，两国的政府代表团和民间代表团进行了频繁的相互访问。我们两国在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中互相支持，为亚非团结反帝事业做出积极的贡献。
    刚果（布）人民是具有光荣革命传统的人民。近百年来，他们为反对殖民主义的统治和压迫、争取民族独立进行了英勇的斗争。刚果（布）在一九六○年宣布独立。一九六三年刚果（布）人民举行起义，通过著名的“八月革命”，推翻了反动的傀儡政权。他们接着又打击了和粉碎了以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的一次又一次对刚果
  （布）的干涉、侵略、颠覆和破坏。目前刚果（布）人民正在警惕地维护着民族独立，不断地把反帝革命事业推向前进。
    刚果（布）人民的斗争，是整个非洲人民反帝反殖斗争的一部分。以美国为首的帝国主义正在加紧推行新殖民主义，力图掠夺和奴役非洲各国人民，破坏和扑灭民族解放运动。它们妄图使未独立的国家永远置于它们的统治之下，把已经取得独立的国家重新变为它们的殖民地。它们的这种狂妄企图，一定会被非洲人民所粉碎。目前整个非洲都处在反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的浪潮中，反帝斗争的形势大好。越来越多的非洲人民觉醒起来，拿起枪杆子，走上了反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争的道路。非洲是属于非洲人民的。非洲人民终将把帝国主义和新老殖民主义势力统统赶出非洲去。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在接见非洲朋友时指出：“我们要加强团结，共同反对帝国主义、殖民主义和他们的走狗，为争取完全彻底的民族独立和解放而斗争。”
    中国和刚果（布）两国的友好合作和两国人民的友谊，是有着深厚基础的。我们是在反对帝国主义、殖民主义的共同斗争中团结起来的，是在互相尊重、互相支援的原则下团结起来的。只要亚非人民和全世界人民团结起来，结成广泛的国际反美统一战线，进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够赢得各国人民反帝革命事业的胜利。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌胜利的时候，刚果（布）贵宾来到我们中间。我们非常高兴地看到，刚果（布）人民热情赞扬我国的无产阶级文化大革命。这是对我国人民的鼓舞和支持。中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    我们相信，刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团的访问，将进一步增进我们两国人民的友谊，促进我们两国的友好合作关系。中国人民将一如既往，坚定不移地支持刚果（布）人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、巩固民族独立、维护国家主权的伟大斗争。让我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，肩并肩地携手前进！
