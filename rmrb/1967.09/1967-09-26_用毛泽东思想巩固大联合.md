The news of Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China has spread like a spring breeze to our Beijing Second General Machinery Factory. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the entire factory are jumping and cheering: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

Recently, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary unity have shone like a beacon, illuminating our path forward. The two major factions in our factory have been engaged in internal strife for some time, with significant opposing sentiments. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the leaders of each organization sat down calmly and conducted serious self-criticism. With the spirit of being strict with oneself and lenient with others, they proactively pointed out the achievements and strengths of the opposing side and strictly examined their own shortcomings and errors. The revolutionary masses of each organization also sat down together for heart-to-heart talks. Everyone said: "Chairman Mao's words have touched our hearts. We, the working class, have no fundamental conflicts of interest and have no reason to split. Only by uniting to fight the enemy together is the right path." In this way, everyone eliminated the opposing sentiments. On September 20, each organization voluntarily removed the faction signs from their doors and replaced them with a new sign reading "Revolutionary Committee."

We deeply understand that achieving organizational unity is just the first step. To consolidate and develop the revolutionary unity and complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit, we must further implement ideological unity. Currently, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, we have thoroughly studied the various active thoughts among the masses after the revolutionary unity and arranged the work plan for the future. We plan to fight while rectifying, overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, sweep the "self" out of our minds, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The news of Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central China, and East China has once again greatly inspired us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We are all spirited and determined to follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　用毛泽东思想巩固大联合
　　北京第二通用机械厂革命委员会筹备委员会
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的消息，象春风一样，吹到了我们北京第二通用机械厂。全厂无产阶级革命派跳跃欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    最近，毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，象一座光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。我们厂的两大派组织，前一个时期互相打“内战”，对立情绪很大。学习了毛主席的最新指示之后，各组织负责人就冷静地坐了下来，认真地进行了自我批评，本着严于责己，宽以待人的精神，主动指出对方的成绩和优点，严格检查自己的缺点和错误。各组织的革命群众，也坐在一起谈心。大家说：“毛主席的话说到了我们心坎里，我们工人阶级本来没有根本的利害冲突，完全没有理由闹分裂，只有联合起来共同对敌，才是正道。”就这样，大家消除了对立情绪，九月二十日，各组织都自动摘掉了大门口的“派牌”，换上了一块写着“革命委员会”的新牌。
    我们深深懂得，组织上实现了革命大联合，这只是第一步，要巩固和发展革命的大联合，完成本单位斗批改的伟大历史使命，还必须进一步实行思想上的大联合。目前，我们在解放军的帮助下，详细地研究了革命大联合后群众中的各种活思想，安排了今后的工作计划。我们准备一面战斗，一面整风，克服派性，加强党性，把头脑中的“私”字扫地出门，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的消息，又一次极大地鼓舞了我们无产阶级革命派。我们个个精神焕发，决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，进一步掀起革命大批判和斗批改的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
