	The morale of U.S. troops in Vietnam is plummeting, with soldiers openly refusing to fight. Incidents of U.S. soldiers throwing away their guns, going on strike, starving themselves, injuring themselves, and even opening fire in protest are becoming increasingly common.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, as the U.S. aggressors suffer continuous defeats in South Vietnam and the anti-war movement in the United States grows stronger, more and more U.S. soldiers are realizing that the war in Vietnam is a futile and unjust one. Their morale is waning, and their anti-war sentiments are growing stronger. Some are even openly refusing to fight, despite the brutal suppression by their commanders.

	Reports indicate that since 1965, there have been over 50 incidents involving thousands of U.S. soldiers refusing to fight in South Vietnam. On May 19 of this year, a large number of soldiers from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division at the Phu Loi base in Tuy Hoa Province defied their commanders' orders and refused to participate in a "sweep" operation in the D sector. When helicopters arrived to transport them to the operation area, many threw away their guns and refused to board. Others went on a hunger strike to protest.

	Fearful of punishment from the Vietnamese people, U.S. soldiers are constantly on edge, hating the war and fearing death. Many count down the days until they can return home, hoping to leave the battlefield as soon as possible. Some try to avoid combat, using every means possible to make themselves sick before a battle, even injuring themselves with knives or other weapons. Just in the Phu My district of My Tho Province, about 100 U.S. soldiers shot themselves in May to avoid participating in combat.

	The U.S. ruling class is extremely anxious and fearful of the growing anti-war sentiment among U.S. soldiers. They are using every means possible to boost morale, such as giving generous "allowances" to troops in Vietnam, exempting them from taxes, sending them on regular vacations to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Tokyo, and other places, and even recruiting a group of pastors to tour U.S. bases in Vietnam on helicopters, chanting spells to numb the soldiers' souls. On the other hand, the U.S. military authorities in Vietnam are brutally suppressing soldiers who refuse to fight. Reports indicate that by March of this year, hundreds of U.S. soldiers with anti-war behavior had been imprisoned in a special prison set up by the U.S. aggressors in the An Khe district of Tuy Hoa Province. A group of U.S. soldiers at the Lai Khe base were brutally tortured by their commanders on May 13 for refusing to participate in a "sweep" operation. Six soldiers were hanged from a helicopter and left to die in mid-air.

	However, the brutal suppression by the U.S. military authorities has only sparked stronger resistance from the soldiers. In April of this year, there were two major shootouts between U.S. soldiers refusing to fight and military police at the O Long base in Tuy Hoa Province and the Phu My base in My Tho Province.

　　侵越美军士气低落公开罢战拒战
    美军士兵扔枪罢战、绝食自伤以至开火对抗的事件不断发生
    据新华社讯　随着美国侵略者在南越战场上连遭惨败和美国人民反对侵越战争的运动日益高涨，越来越多的美军士兵意识到侵越战争是一场没有出路的不义之战。他们士气不振，厌战、反战情绪越来越强烈，甚至不顾指挥官的残酷镇压，公然拒绝参战。
    据报道，根据不完全统计，从一九六五年起，在南越战场上已经发生五十多起包括数以千计的美军士兵拒战的事件。今年五月十九日土龙木省富利基地上的美军第一步兵师的大批士兵违抗他们的指挥官的命令，拒绝到D战区“扫荡”。当直升飞机前来把他们送往“扫荡”地区时，许多人把枪扔掉，不上飞机。还有许多人绝食，以表示抗议。
    由于害怕越南人民的惩罚，美国士兵终日胆战心惊，厌战怕死。许多美军士兵日夜屈指计算归国日期，盼望早日离开战场，有的想逃避战斗，千方百计使自己在打仗前病倒，甚至用匕首或其他武器弄坏本人的肢体。仅仅美萩省平德地区，就有大约一百名美军在今年五月份用枪打伤自己，以免除参加战斗。
    美国统治集团对美军士兵日益滋长的厌战反战情绪十分惊慌害怕。他们千方百计地采取种种办法，妄图提高美军士气。如给侵越美军发优厚的“津贴”，免征他们的税，让他们定期到香港、曼谷、东京等地“休假”，甚至还收罗一批牧师，让他们乘着直升飞机到南越各地美军驻地巡回念咒，以麻醉美军士兵的灵魂。另一方面，侵越美军当局对拒战士兵实行残酷的镇压。据报道，美国侵略者在土龙木省安和地区特设的监狱里，到今年三月，已经关押了数百名有反战行为的美国士兵。驻在莱溪基地的一批美军士兵，五月十三日由于拒绝外出“扫荡”，而受到他们指挥官的灭绝人性的虐待。六个士兵被吊在一架直升飞机下面，在空中盘旋致死。
    但是，美军当局的残暴镇压更激起了美军士兵强烈的反抗。今年四月，在土龙木省油汀基地和美萩省平德基地曾先后发生两起拒战美军士兵同宪兵的大规模火并事件。（附图片）
