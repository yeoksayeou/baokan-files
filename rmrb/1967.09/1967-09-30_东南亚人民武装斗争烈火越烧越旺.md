Chairman Mao said: “The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct.”

The fierce flames of armed struggle in Southeast Asia burn brighter.

Over the past year, the armed struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia have burned brighter and brighter.

In Laos, the patriotic military and civilians have achieved great victories in the war against American aggression and for national salvation. In just the first half of this year, they have annihilated over five thousand enemy troops and shot down or destroyed more than one hundred and eighty enemy aircraft. While waging a people's war, the people of Laos have been continuously consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, creating conditions for greater victories.

The Communist Party of Burma has led the Burmese people in a revolutionary armed struggle for twenty years. After smashing the plots of domestic and foreign modern revisionists, it is now developing victoriously. Currently, in more than fifty counties across Burma, the activities of the people's armed forces have spread to over thirty counties. The victory of the people's revolutionary armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party is a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

In Thailand, the people's armed struggle has achieved brilliant results in the first half of this year, annihilating more than one hundred and ninety Thai reactionary military and police in the first five months. Now, in seventy-one provinces of Thailand, guerrilla warfare and armed propaganda teams are active in more than twenty provinces.

The armed struggles of the peoples of the Philippines and North Kalimantan have dealt new blows to the American imperialists and their lackeys.

In India, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has broken the shackles of the "parliamentary road" imposed by the Soviet and Indian revisionists, taken up arms, and resolved to follow the path of the Chinese revolution. Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, the revolutionary peasants of the Nasalbari region in Darjeeling district rose up in March this year to wage armed struggle. Currently, a storm of peasant land revolution is sweeping across the land of India.

The heroic Communist Party members and people of Indonesia have summed up the experiences and lessons of the revolutionary struggle, are overcoming all difficulties, and are engaged in new battles. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and are determined to follow the "Jinggangshan" road.
