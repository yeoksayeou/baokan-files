	Malaysian Political Prisoners Stage Hunger Strike Against Persecution

	Political prisoners in Malaysia (including Singapore) recently went on a hunger strike to strongly protest against the barbaric beatings and cruel persecution carried out by the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime at the instigation of American and British imperialism.

	It is reported that the authorities of the Changi Prison in Singapore, after careful planning, arbitrarily transferred a political prisoner to the "Central Prison" for solitary confinement on August 28, subjecting him to new forms of physical and mental torture. This fascist atrocity by the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime aroused the intense indignation of the political prisoners in the prison, who immediately protested to the prison authorities. The prison authorities, using fascist tactics, sent in a large number of "riot police" to brutally suppress the political prisoners. The political prisoners then announced that they would go on a hunger strike starting from August 31 to protest against the persecution by the puppet regime.

	Sudanese Finance Minister Condemns U.S. Economic Pressure

	Sudanese Minister of Finance and Economy Sharif Hussein Khindi issued a statement in Khartoum on September 14, condemning the series of economic pressures exerted by the U.S. government on Sudan, aiming to force Sudan to become a puppet of Washington. He said that the U.S. government had notified Sudan that unless Sudan resumed diplomatic relations with the United States, it would stop so-called "aid" to Sudan. He said that the pressure and economic blockade that the United States is attempting to impose on Sudan will not achieve its goals.

It is reported that Riad was satisfied with the talks he held separately with Brezhnev and Kosygin.

	During his visit to the Soviet Union, Riad went to Yugoslavia from September 6 to 9, where he exchanged views with Tito and Tito's Foreign Minister Nikic on the current situation in the Middle East.
