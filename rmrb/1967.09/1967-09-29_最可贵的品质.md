Editor's Note: The following short stories, from different angles, reflect the new ideological landscape of our people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Marx said, "Revolution is the locomotive of history." The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to engage in this class struggle in the political and ideological realm, cleansing the filth from the depths of people's souls, and propelling our great motherland forward at a rapid pace. Under the nurturing of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the great criticism and struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party, and in the great storms of class struggle, a new generation of communists is growing vigorously, new revolutionary thoughts and winds are being widely promoted, and the spiritual face of our people is undergoing tremendous and profound changes.

This is the most important achievement and the most precious gain of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country; it is also the fundamental condition to prevent the restoration of capitalism, prevent the infiltration of revisionism, and ensure that the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country will never change color.

As we enthusiastically celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and enthusiastically hail the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Let us closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further unite and combine our forces, and seize new and greater victories!

The Most Precious Quality

One morning, in Beijing No. 89 Middle School, a member of the active group studying Chairman Mao's works from the Navy, Eu Qingwei, entered the classroom of Class 2, Grade 3. The classroom was empty, and only one student was sitting there alone. What was he doing? Eu Qingwei walked over to take a look. It turned out that the student was carefully and gently wiping a plaster statue of the great leader Chairman Mao with a clean cloth. He was so focused on his work that he didn't even hear Eu Qingwei's footsteps.

This incident gave Eu Qingwei a great deal of inspiration, making him think about a series of issues.

Originally, in this school, Class 2, Grade 3 was considered relatively backward. After Eu Qingwei was assigned to work with this class, he indeed saw many shortcomings. Eu Qingwei was originally prepared to give them a harsh criticism. However, the incident before him presented him with a sharp question: Was the past view of this class correct in grasping the essence and mainstream? Does a relatively backward class have no good points at all?

Take this student who was wiping the statue of Chairman Mao, for example! He was precisely the one whom Eu Qingwei considered relatively "naughty" and was prepared to criticize. But now, he was sitting upright in front of the statue of Chairman Mao, concentrating on this serious task, showing his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao! This point had not been noticed before.

Afterward, Eu Qingwei continued to pay attention to observations. He discovered that this statue of Chairman Mao originally belonged to the entire school. During the Cultural Revolution, the students of Class 2, Grade 3, fearing that it might be damaged or defiled, solemnly moved it into the classroom for protection. This statue was not wiped by just one person; many students did so. Before wiping, some people would wash their hands clean, fearing that even a speck of dust might fall on Chairman Mao's statue....

All of this deeply moved Eu Qingwei. The revolutionary youths' intense feelings of love for Chairman Mao deeply educated him. He felt that although the students in this class had various shortcomings, their boundless faith, admiration, and love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought were the most precious. This is the essence and mainstream of the revolutionary youths, and it is also the most worthy of learning from.

From then on, Eu Qingwei seriously learned from the good points of the students in Class 2, Grade 3 from all aspects. After a period of time, he summarized the ten good points of the revolutionary youths, each with specific facts, and wrote a big-character poster titled "What I Have Learned from the Revolutionary Youths?" and posted it in this class's classroom.

This big-character poster caused a great stir among the students. Everyone discussed it. Some said, "They say our class is the worst, but we have so many good points!" Others said, "I've been in this class for more than three years, only hearing others talk about our shortcomings. The soldiers have only been here for two months and have learned ten good points." Some people suggested, "The soldiers have learned our good points, but how many of the soldiers' good points have we learned?" Thus, the students discussed and summarized under the theme of "What Have We Learned from the Soldiers?" and quickly launched a wave of learning from the soldiers.

Through mutual learning, the feelings between the soldiers and the revolutionary youths grew deeper, and the requirements for doing a good job in military and political training and resuming classes and making revolution became stronger. In late May, this class began to resume classes and make revolution, becoming the first among the seven classes in Grade 3 to achieve this, playing a leading role in other classes.

    编者按：这里发表的几篇小故事，从几个不同的侧面，反映了我国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中的崭新的思想面貌。
    马克思说：“革命是历史的火车头”。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，动员亿万革命群众，投入这场政治思想领域里的阶级斗争，涤荡着人们灵魂深处的污泥浊水，推动我们伟大的祖国飞速前进。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育下，在对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判大斗争中，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，一代共产主义新人正在茁壮地成长，革命的新思想、新风气正在普遍发扬，我国人民的精神面貌正在发生巨大的深刻的变化。
    这是我国无产阶级文化大革命最重要的成就，最可贵的收获；也是防止资本主义复辟，防止修正主义侵蚀，保证我国的无产阶级专政永不变色的最根本的条件。
    在我们热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，我们热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步团结起来，联合起来，夺取新的更大的胜利！
    最可贵的品质
    一天清晨，在北京市八十九中参加军训工作的海军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子欧庆伟同志，走进了三年级二班的教室。教室里空荡荡的，只见一位同学独自坐在那里。他在干什么？欧庆伟走近一看，原来这位同学正在用一块干净的布，细心地轻轻地擦拭着伟大领袖毛主席的石膏塑像。他工作得那么全神贯注，连欧庆伟的脚步声都没有听到。
    这件事给了欧庆伟同志很大启发，使他想到了一系列的问题。
    原来，在这个学校里，三年级二班一向被认为是比较落后的。欧庆伟分工负责这个班的工作以后，也确实看到了不少缺点。欧庆伟本来准备把他们狠狠批评一通。可是，眼前的这件事，却给他提出了一个尖锐的问题：过去对这个班的看法，是不是抓住了本质和主流？比较落后的班是不是就没有一点优点？
    就拿这位擦拭毛主席塑像的同学来说吧！正是自己认为比较“调皮”，准备进行批评的一个对象。可现在呢，他端端正正地坐在毛主席塑像前面，专心致志地从事这件严肃的工作，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱！这一点，过去自己就没有注意到。
    以后，欧庆伟就继续注意观察。他发现这座毛主席塑像原来是全校的。在文化大革命中，三年级二班同学害怕碰坏了，污损了，才隆重地搬到教室里保护起来。这座塑像也不只是一个人擦拭，很多同学都这样做。擦拭以前，有些人还要把手洗干净，生怕毛主席的塑像上沾上一点灰迹。……
    所有这一切，都使欧庆伟十分感动。革命小将无限热爱毛主席的强烈感情，深深地教育了他。他感到：尽管这个班的同学存在着这样或那样的缺点，然而，他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限热爱，却是最可贵的。这才是革命小将的本质和主流，也是最值得自己学习的。
    从此，欧庆伟认真地从各方面学习三年级二班同学的优点。经过一段时间，他总结了革命小将的十条优点，每一条都列举了具体事实，写成一张《我向革命小将学到了些什么？》的大字报，贴在这个班的教室里。
    这张大字报在同学中引起了很大震动。大家纷纷议论。有的说：“人家都说咱们班最差劲，没想到还有这么多优点哩！”有的说：“我在这个班呆了三年多，只听到别人讲我们的缺点。解放军才来两个多月，就学到了十大优点。”还有的人提出：“我们的优点解放军学去了，解放军的优点我们学到了多少？”于是，同学们以“向解放军学到了什么？”为题，进行讨论、总结，很快掀起了一个向解放军学习的热潮。
    通过相互学习，解放军同革命小将的感情越来越深，搞好军政训练、复课闹革命的要求越来越强烈。五月下旬，这个班开始了复课闹革命，成为三年级七个班里最早实现复课闹革命的班，对其他各班起了推动作用。
