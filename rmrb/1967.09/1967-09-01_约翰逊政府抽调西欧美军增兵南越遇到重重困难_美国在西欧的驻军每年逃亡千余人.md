The Johnson administration, in an effort to make up for the shortage of U.S. troops in Vietnam, has been continually redeploying American forces from Western Europe to the battlefields of South Vietnam. However, just as the anti-war sentiment among U.S. troops in Vietnam is growing, many soldiers in the U.S. forces stationed in Western Europe are also taking advantage of various opportunities to desert and avoid being sent to Vietnam. According to a report published by the British newspaper *The Times* on August 17, the number of deserters from U.S. forces in Western Europe reaches over a thousand each year, with an average of sixty deserters per month who refuse to go to Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder.

*The Times* report states that these American soldiers, for the most part, have been helped by underground anti-war organizations scattered throughout various countries in Western Europe to desert.

*The Times* report quotes a representative from one of these underground organizations as saying that their group was established a year ago. The main members include French residents and American expatriates living in Paris. The task of this underground organization is to assist soldiers in the U.S. military who do not want to go to Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder by helping them find hiding places and suitable work. After deserting, American soldiers dare not return to their home country, and are forced to hide under assumed names in Western Europe because, according to the reactionary laws of the U.S. government, deserters face a minimum sentence of ten years in prison.

According to the report, with the exception of Portugal, almost every country in Western Europe has such underground networks operating. Due to the French government's refusal to recognize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's agreement on deserters and its refusal to hand over American soldiers who have fled to France to the U.S. military police, the work of assisting American deserters has been relatively smooth in France. Over the past two years, several such groups have been active in France.

According to an American deserter who goes by the name of Buster, he was conscripted into the U.S. Army at the age of seventeen. After being stationed in West Germany, he learned from some old soldiers who had served in South Vietnam about the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam, and decided not to go to Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder. When he was ordered to be transferred to Vietnam, he deserted with the help of the underground organization. Now Buster works on a construction site in a country in Western Europe.

*The Times* also reported on the situation of a black soldier named Jones. Jones believes that "Americans treat Vietnamese people the same way they treat black people." When Jones was stationed with the U.S. forces in Nuremberg, West Germany, and heard the news that he was to be transferred to Vietnam, he decided to desert. With the help of others, he escaped from West Germany, passed through Denmark, and went to Sweden to make a living.

*The Times* reports that the Netherlands is also an active center for these underground organizations. According to a recent disclosure by a Dutch parliamentarian, the number of American soldiers who have fled to the Netherlands has reached several hundred.

### 约翰逊政府抽调西欧美军增兵南越遇到重重困难　美国在西欧的驻军每年逃亡千余人

　　约翰逊政府抽调西欧美军增兵南越遇到重重困难
　　美国在西欧的驻军每年逃亡千余人
    本报讯　约翰逊政府为了弥补美国侵越兵力的不足，不断抽调西欧美国驻军到南越战场。但是，同侵越美军厌战拒战的情绪日益增长一样，美国驻西欧军队中的许多士兵，也在利用各种机会纷纷开小差，逃避到南越去卖命。据英国《泰晤士报》八月十七日发表的一篇报道透露，西欧美国驻军每年开小差的人数达到一千多人，其中由于不愿去南越充当侵略炮灰而逃亡的，平均每个月有六十多人。
    《泰晤士报》的报道说，这些美国士兵，大部分都是通过分布在西欧各国的一些反战地下组织的帮助而逃亡的。
    《泰晤士报》的报道引用了一个这种地下组织的代表的话说，他们这个组织是在一年以前成立的。主要成员包括居住在巴黎的一些法国人和美国侨民，这个地下组织的任务是协助美军中不愿去越南当炮灰的人开小差，为他们找到藏身的地方和适当的工作。美国士兵逃亡以后不敢回国，被迫隐姓匿名在西欧流亡，因为根据美国反动政府的法律，开小差的士兵至少要被判处十年的徒刑。
    据报道，除了葡萄牙以外，在西欧每一个国家几乎都有这样的地下网在活动。由于法国政府不再承认北大西洋公约组织关于逃兵的协定，不把从国外逃到法国来的美军士兵送回原来驻地的美军宪兵，所以协助美军逃兵的工作在法国进行比较顺利。两年以来，在法国有好几个这类团体在活动。
    据一个化名为巴斯特的美国逃兵说，他是在十七岁的时候被征参加美国陆军的。派驻西德以后，他从驻西欧美军的一些曾在南越服役的老兵那里，知道了美国侵略军在南越无恶不作的滔天罪行，就决心不到南越去充当炮灰。当他奉命调到南越去的时候，他就在地下组织的帮助下开了小差。现在巴斯特在西欧一个国家的建筑工地上做工。
    《泰晤士报》还报道了一个名叫琼斯的黑人士兵的情况。琼斯认为，“美国人对待越南人，就象他们对待黑人一样。”当琼斯随美军驻在西德纽伦堡的时候，听到他自己即将被调往南越的消息，就决心开小差。他在别人的帮助下逃离西德，经过丹麦到瑞典谋生。
    《泰晤士报》说，荷兰也是这种地下组织的一个活跃的中心。据一个荷兰议员最近透露，逃亡到荷兰的美国兵士已经达到数百人。
