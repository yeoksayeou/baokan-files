The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a torrential flood, is surging forward, irresistible. In this great situation, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" has been published. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, and revolutionary people all over the country, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and initiating a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. The Chinese Khrushchev and his gang have fallen into the vast ocean of people's war. However, they are still alive and unwilling to admit defeat, and will surely make various counterattacks to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Tao Zhu is a Khrushchev-like figure. Sometimes he is extremely rightist, using every means to protect the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, desperately trying to pull the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the right. Sometimes he appears in an extremely "leftist" guise, running around giving speeches, peddling anarchist goods, and attacking the proletarian headquarters. The handful of ringleaders and behind-the-scenes manipulators of the "May 16 Corps" have inherited the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Tao Zhu and his gang. They use seemingly extremely "leftist" but actually extremely rightist slogans to stir up the wind of "doubt everything," attacking the proletarian headquarters, sowing discord, and fishing in troubled waters, attempting to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to sabotage and split the main pillar of the proletarian dictatorship—the great People's Liberation Army of China. This is truly laughable and presumptuous.

Chairman Mao said, "Without a people's army, people have nothing." The several decades of revolutionary struggle in China have proven this great and unshakable truth, and the more than one year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further proven this great truth. The handful of ringleaders and behind-the-scenes manipulators of the "May 16 Corps" want to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and thus must direct their spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army of China. We must be highly vigilant and give them a resolute counterattack.

Our unit has been guarding by Chairman Mao's side since the Yan'an days, carrying out the glorious task of protecting the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The guardsmen by Chairman Mao's side are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For more than twenty years, we have followed the great commander Chairman Mao in battles north and south, driven away the Japanese invaders, overthrown the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and established New China. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The practice of struggle has made us realize that at every crucial moment of the proletarian revolution, we must resolutely defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only in this way can we ensure the victory of the revolution. Today, at this crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of bravely fighting and fearing no sacrifice, and pledge to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to strive for the complete victory of this great struggle.

    在毛主席身边的警卫战士最忠于毛主席的革命路线	北京卫戍区某部警卫连
    震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，如一泻千里的洪流，滚滚向前，势不可挡。就在这个大好形势下，姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》一文发表了。全国无产阶级革命派，红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开猛烈进攻，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，已陷入人民战争的汪洋大海之中。但是，他们人还在，心不死，决不甘心于他们的失败，还会进行种种反扑，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    陶铸就是赫鲁晓夫式的人物。他时而极右，千方百计地保护党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，拚命把无产阶级文化大革命拉向右转。他忽而以极“左”的面貌出现，奔走呼叫，到处做报告，大肆贩卖无政府主义黑货，炮打无产阶级司令部。“五·一六兵团”这个反革命组织的一小撮坏头头和幕后操纵者，就是继承了陶铸一伙反革命修正主义的一套。他们用貌似极“左”而实质极右的口号，又刮起“怀疑一切”的妖风，炮打无产阶级司令部，挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，妄想动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，破坏和分裂无产阶级专政的主要支柱——伟大的中国人民解放军。这真是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”中国几十年的革命斗争的实践证明了这个颠扑不破的伟大真理，一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命更证明了这一伟大真理。“五·一六兵团”的一小撮坏头头及其幕后操纵者要破坏无产阶级文化大革命，就必然要把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军，我们一定要百倍警惕，予以坚决的还击。
    我们连队，从延安时起就一直守卫在毛主席的身边，担负着保卫伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的光荣任务。守卫在毛主席身边的警卫战士，最忠于毛主席，最忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。二十几年来，我们跟着伟大统帅毛主席南征北战，赶走了日本侵略者，消灭了蒋家王朝，建立了新中国。解放以后，又在毛主席的英明领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。斗争的实践使我们体会到：在无产阶级革命的每一个关键时刻，都必须坚决捍卫毛主席的伟大战略部署，只有这样，才能保证革命的胜利发展。今天，在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，我们要继续发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲的革命精神，誓死捍卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，捍卫毛主席的伟大战略部署，捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，争取这场伟大斗争的彻底胜利。
