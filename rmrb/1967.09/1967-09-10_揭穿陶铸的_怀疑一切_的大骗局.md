The Cultural Revolution is deepening, and the proletarian revolutionary masses are achieving victory after victory. The situation in Guizhou is also very good.

The new situation forces the class enemies to adopt new counter-revolutionary strategies. They sometimes appear extremely rightist, but more often they appear in the guise of extreme "leftists," waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, donning the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to frenziedly sabotage the Cultural Revolution. The old revisionist Tao Zhu is a typical example of such a counter-revolutionary two-faced person.

Last August, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. The proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards across the country responded to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. The bourgeois headquarters quickly collapsed, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were driven to the point of having nowhere to hide. This old revisionist Tao Zhu, feeling that his doom was approaching, resorted to his usual two-faced tricks, transforming himself into an extreme "leftist" anarchist, shouting slogans like "In the Cultural Revolution, doubting everything is correct" and "Anyone can oppose anyone," vigorously advocating so-called "universal bombardment." He used the reactionary slogans of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything," which are "left" in form but right in essence, to cover up the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few," thereby deceiving a section of the masses and attempting to turn the spearhead against the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

Tao Zhu's "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything" is a very cunning but also very clumsy big deception.

Does he really advocate "universal bombardment"? Of course not. He has never advocated bombarding the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev; on the contrary, he strongly opposes Chairman Mao's great big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." What he wants to bombard is the proletarian headquarters.

Does he really advocate "doubting everything"? Of course not. He does not allow others to doubt him. Has he not shamelessly boasted, "I am basically a revolutionary of the proletariat"?

What "doubt everything," what "anyone can oppose," all lies! All lies! These are all deceptive tricks! Tao Zhu's purpose in playing this clumsy trick is just one: to attempt to overthrow the proletarian headquarters and carry out a capitalist restoration.

However, no matter how cunning the fox is, it cannot escape the clever hunter. The proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the cleverest hunters. The counter-revolutionary two-faced person Tao Zhu has finally been dragged before the masses, exposing his ugly true face.

The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" further peeled off Tao Zhu's disguise, dealing a fatal blow to the bourgeois headquarters. We proletarian revolutionaries must, like Comrade Yao Wenyuan, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and join the great criticism, achieving new victories in the great battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

　　揭穿陶铸的“怀疑一切”的大骗局
　　贵阳红代会新贵工九一五战斗团
    文化大革命正在深入发展，无产阶级革命派取得了一个又一个的胜利。贵州也是一派大好形势。
    新的形势，迫使阶级敌人采取了新的反革命策略。他们忽而显出极右，更多的是以极“左”的面孔出现，打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思主义的外衣，疯狂地破坏文化大革命。老修正主义者陶铸，就是这样一个最典型的反革命两面派。
    去年八月，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“炮打司令部”的大字报，全国无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将响应毛主席的伟大号召，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起了猛烈的进攻。资产阶级司令部迅速土崩瓦解，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，被轰得无处藏身。陶铸这个老修正主义者，感到灭亡的命运即将来临，便使出了他惯于玩弄的两面手法，摇身一变，以极“左”的无政府主义的面貌出现，大叫什么“在文化大革命中，怀疑一切是正确的”，“任何人都可以反对”，极力主张所谓“普遍轰”。他用“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”这个形“左”实右的反动口号，给“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，涂上了一层保护色，从而蒙骗一部分群众，妄图把矛头转向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    陶铸提出的“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”，是一个十分阴险然而又十分拙劣的大骗局。
    他是真的主张“普遍轰”吗？当然不是，他从来不主张炮轰以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，相反，他是死命反对毛主席的“炮打司令部”这张伟大的大字报的。他所要轰的是无产阶级司令部。
    他是真的主张“怀疑一切”吗？当然不是，他就不准别人怀疑他，他不是恬不知耻地吹嘘“我基本上是无产阶级革命家”吗？
    什么“怀疑一切”，什么“任何人都可以反对”，骗人！骗人！统统是骗人的鬼话！陶铸玩弄这套拙劣把戏的目的只有一个，这就是妄图推翻无产阶级司令部，实行资本主义复辟。
    但是，狐狸再狡猾，也逃不过聪明的猎人。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，就是最聪明的猎人。反革命两面派陶铸，终于被揪到了广大群众面前，露出了他丑恶的本来面目。
    姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》的发表，进一步剥下了陶铸的画皮，给了资产阶级司令部以致命的一击。我们无产阶级革命派一定要象姚文元同志那样，活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，投入革命的大批判，在彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战役中立新功。
