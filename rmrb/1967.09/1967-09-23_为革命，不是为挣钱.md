	For the Revolution, Not for Money
	Li Yinchí

	In July and August 1961, during his more than twenty-day visit to the forests of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, the Chinese Khrushchev never mentioned promoting proletarian politics, never mentioned planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never mentioned breaking private interests and establishing public interests. Instead, he relentlessly peddled the stench of money, advocating "material incentives." The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly said, "Don't be afraid of workers earning more money. If workers earn more, production will develop, which is beneficial for both the country and the people." "Without more money, production enthusiasm will not be enough, and you won't work hard to produce." He even blatantly said, "We must emphasize material incentives, especially the form of wages and the determination of quotas, which should be considered from the perspective of stimulating the enthusiasm of the workers." According to the Chinese Khrushchev, workers will have high enthusiasm only if they earn more money. This is a great slander against forestry workers. Listen to the forestry workers' resounding response: "We are here to make revolution, not to earn money to feed our families." Lenin said, "To work for money—that is the morality of the capitalist world." The Chinese Khrushchev exudes the smell of money from every pore, truly a worthy descendant of the bourgeoisie. His mind is filled with ideas like "money can make the devil push the millstone" and "if you don't work for yourself, heaven and earth will punish you."

	All things grow with the help of the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. To mobilize the enthusiasm of revolutionary workers, we cannot rely on material incentives but must rely on the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics. In the flames of revolution and on the enemy's execution grounds, revolutionary fighters have shed blood and sacrificed their lives, persevered in struggle, and achieved great revolutionary victories, all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. In the eighteen years since the founding of the country, every achievement in our socialist revolution and socialist construction has been the result of emphasizing proletarian politics and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev does not understand the noble character of the proletariat's dedication to revolution. He portrays the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers as being for "earning more money." This is entirely out of his reactionary class instincts. During his visit to the forest area, the Chinese Khrushchev personally intervened in the formulation of numerous bonus and subsidy systems, promoting material incentives, and attempting to lead the broad masses of workers in the forest area down the path of "peaceful evolution." His intentions are truly sinister! We warn the Chinese Khrushchev: we do not want your "material incentive" junk. We want revolution!

　　为革命，不是为挣钱
　　李荫池
    一九六一年七、八月间，中国赫鲁晓夫在东北、内蒙古林区之行的二十多天中，闭口不谈突出无产阶级政治，闭口不谈大树毛泽东思想，闭口不谈破“私”立“公”，却极力贩卖铜臭熏天的“物质刺激”。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“不要怕工人多挣钱，工人多挣钱了，生产就发展，这是对国对民都有利。”“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产。”他还明目张胆地说：“要强调物质刺激，特别是工资的形式、定额的确定，要从有利于发挥职工积极性这方面考虑。”按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，工人多挣了钱，才能积极性高。这是对林业工人的莫大污蔑。请听林业工人们响亮的回答：“我们是为了干革命，不是为了挣钱养家糊口。”列宁说：“做事就是为了拿钱，——这是资本主义世界的道德。”中国赫鲁晓夫的每个汗毛孔都散发着铜臭味，真不愧是资产阶级的孝子贤孙。他满脑子都是“有钱能使鬼推磨”，“人不为己，天诛地灭”。
    万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。调动革命职工的积极性，不能靠物质刺激，而只能靠光焰无际的毛泽东思想，靠突出无产阶级政治。在革命的烽火中，在敌人的刑场上，革命战士们抛头颅，洒热血，坚持斗争，并取得革命的伟大胜利，都是靠毛泽东思想。建国十八年来，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的辉煌成就，哪一项不是靠突出无产阶级的政治，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想？中国赫鲁晓夫根本不理解无产阶级一心为革命的高尚品德。他把广大职工群众的革命积极性，说成是为了“多挣钱”。这完全是出于他的反动阶级本能。中国赫鲁晓夫在林区之行中，还亲自插手制定了名目繁多的奖金和津贴制度，大搞物质刺激，妄图把林区的广大职工，引上“和平演变”的道路，其用心何其毒也！正告中国赫鲁晓夫，我们不要你这套“物质刺激”的黑货，我们要革命！
