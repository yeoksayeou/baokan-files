“All the trees are red in the frost of autumn, the heavenly soldiers' fury pierces the heavens.” The People's Liberation Army Air Force and Navy Air Force units, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, remembering Chairman Mao's great instruction to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," riding the strong east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have, in the struggle to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to defend the skies of our motherland, struck down and damaged fourteen enemy aircraft invading our airspace in the past year (including twelve shot down), creating brilliant achievements.

This is the greatest achievement in our military's air defense in recent years. It vividly shows that the great spiritual power unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly enhanced our military's combat power to defend the skies of our motherland. After being tempered and tested by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our military's air defense combat capabilities have been further enhanced. Our great motherland's aerial Great Wall is now stronger, more solid, and more invincible than ever.

The great victory of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has shaken the world. The U.S. imperialists, the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries have heard the death knell of their doom in the roaring waves of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are terrified to death and hate it to the core, and with tenfold hatred and a hundredfold madness, they have launched frequent war provocations and sabotage activities from land, air, and sea against our country. The U.S. imperialists not only instigate their lackeys, the Indian reactionaries and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, to constantly harass our coastal defenses and borders, but also dispatch their so-called "most advanced aircraft" and old flying thieves to constantly invade our airspace, provoking war. Among the fourteen enemy aircraft shot down and damaged in the past year, twelve were directly dispatched by U.S. imperialism, piloted and controlled by Americans themselves. "How can an ant shake a tree?" Even if they dispatch more aircraft, they cannot stop the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The only result of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs' frequent movements is to leave a record in the recent glorious history of the People's Liberation Army: during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army shot down and damaged the most enemy aircraft, shot down the most U.S. aggressor aircraft, and shot down the most U.S. new-type aircraft.

Among those who shot down these U.S. aircraft, many are young soldiers and newcomers. What did they rely on to defeat the enemy and achieve such brilliant achievements?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people and not things that are decisive." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb; the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat power is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." The brilliant achievement of shooting down and damaging fourteen enemy aircraft in the past year is the result of the heroic air force and navy air force soldiers following Chairman Mao's great teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, relying on emphasizing proletarian politics, relying on the Four Firsts, relying on the revolutionization of people's thinking—in a word, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The brilliant achievement of shooting down and damaging fourteen enemy aircraft in the past year is, first of all, the result of planting the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao deeply in the minds of the soldiers. Over the past year, the soldiers and officers of the air force and navy air force units, together with the revolutionary masses of the whole country, have, in the great struggle of criticism, severely criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by China's Khrushchev, exposed their counter-revolutionary faces, and further cultivated and strengthened their deep feelings of boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. Through the criticism of China's Khrushchev, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have come to a deeper understanding that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the great savior of the people of the world. Some soldiers, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, solemnly swear that to defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will shed their blood in the sky to write the words "loyal to Chairman Mao" in their own blood. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao means unlimited combat power.

The brilliant achievement of shooting down and damaging fourteen enemy aircraft in the past year is also the result of planting the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and carrying out thorough ideological revolutionization, composing a magnificent song of victory with the character "public." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers, with the revolutionary spirit of "pounding the U.S. wolf in the air and beating the fallen dog on the ground" and "shooting down enemy aircraft when they come and criticizing 'Self-Cultivation' when they don't," have severely criticized China's Khrushchev's representative work "Self-Cultivation," thoroughly stripping off its disguise, and recognizing that "Self-Cultivation" is a thorough anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed, and the black program for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism. Breaking comes first, and establishing follows. Through the criticism of "Self-Cultivation," a new high tide of studying the "Three Articles" and carrying out thorough ideological revolutionization has been set off. In this way, when fighting, thousands of people form a combat unit, sparing no effort, fighting for the same goal of annihilating the invading enemy, and thus winning every battle. In one battle, the co-pilot of a certain navy air force unit, Lü Jiliang, found that the leader had entered the smoke layer, and pulling out white smoke would easily expose himself, so he promptly reminded the leader to change altitude and hide to engage the enemy. When the leader Wang Zhushu opened fire and hit the enemy aircraft, he chased after it and added a burst of cannon fire, blowing up the enemy aircraft in mid-air.

The brilliant achievement of shooting down and damaging fourteen enemy aircraft in the past year is also the result of planting the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line. For many years, the struggle between Chairman Mao's line of building the army and the bourgeois line of building the army has been concentrated on the fundamental question of whether to emphasize politics or military affairs, whether to emphasize proletarian politics or bourgeois politics. Emphasizing politics is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and to let Mao Zedong Thought command everything. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, set off an unprecedented tide of criticizing the bourgeois military line, severely criticized Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's military-first and technology-first, using bourgeois regularization and modernization to oppose proletarian revolutionization, engaging in large-scale competitions, eclecticism, political impact, and the militarist and purely military views of not relying on the people's war and not relying on the masses, and thoroughly smashed all the old rules and foreign frameworks that violate Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly established the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought command the battle and command everything. Recently, the air force unit that shot down the enemy U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft used Chairman Mao's quotations to command the battle in the battle, and the soldiers used Chairman Mao's quotations to encourage each other, with extremely high morale, fighting bravely and strongly, and finally shot down the enemy aircraft. Mao Zedong Thought has truly become the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb commanding the entire battle process.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Chairman Mao's words have the highest level, the highest prestige, and the greatest power. Every sentence is a truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences." The soldiers and officers deeply feel that this is an absolutely true truth.

　　毛泽东思想武装的人是最大的战斗力
　　我空军和海军航空兵乘文化大革命东风一年来创造击落击伤敌机十四架的光辉战绩
    据新华社二十九日讯　本社记者述评：“万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”人民解放军空军部队和海军航空兵部队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的伟大教导，乘无产阶级文化大革命的强劲东风，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和保卫祖国万里长空的战斗中，一年来连续击落击伤入侵我领空敌机十四架（其中击落十二架），创造了光辉的战绩。
    这是近几年来我军在国土防空中战绩最大的一年。它生动地表明，无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的巨大精神力量，大大增强了我军保卫祖国领空的战斗威力。经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，我军防空作战的能力更加提高了。我们伟大祖国的空中长城，比过去更加坚强、更加巩固、更加不可逾越了。
    由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利，震撼了全世界。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，从中国汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的怒涛声中，听到了他们末日来临的丧钟。他们怕得要死，恨得要命，以十倍的仇恨，百倍的疯狂，从陆地、天空和海上向我国发起了频繁的战争挑衅和捣乱活动。美帝国主义不但唆使其奴才——印度反动派和蒋介石匪帮不断窜扰我海防和边疆，而且派遣所谓“最新式的飞机”和老牌飞贼，不断侵入我领空，进行战争挑衅。过去一年中，被我击落击伤的十四架敌机中，就有十二架是美帝国主义直接派遣，由美国人亲自驾驶和控制的。“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。他们即使派遣更多的飞机也无法阻挡无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚巨流。美帝国主义及其走狗如此频繁蠢动的唯一结果，只能是在中国人民解放军最近几年的光辉战史上，留下一页这样的记录：无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军打落打伤敌机最多，打落美国强盗飞机最多，打落美国新式飞机最多。
    击落这些美国飞机的我军有功人员，有不少是小将，是新手。他们是靠什么战胜敌人，创造如此辉煌战绩的呢？
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”林副主席指示我们：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”一年来击落击伤敌机十四架的光辉战绩，就是英雄的空军和海军航空兵战士们，遵循毛主席的伟大教导和林副主席的指示，靠突出无产阶级政治，靠四个第一，靠人的思想革命化，一句话，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想取得的。
    一年来击落击伤敌机十四架的光辉战绩，首先是指战员们在头脑里大树特树伟大领袖毛主席绝对权威的结果。一年多来，空军和海军航空兵部队的指战员们和全国的无产阶级革命派一起，在革命的大批判中，狠狠地批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，认清了他们的反革命嘴脸，进一步培养和增强了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的深厚感情。通过对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判，广大指战员越来越深刻地认识到，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全世界人民的大救星。有些指战员面对毛主席像庄严宣誓，为保卫毛主席，为保卫毛泽东思想，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，即使血洒长空，也要用自己的鲜血写成“忠于毛主席”五个大字。无限忠于毛主席，就有无限的战斗力。
    一年来击落击伤敌机十四架的光辉战绩，也是大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威，破私立公，大搞思想革命化的结果，是“公”字谱成的壮丽凯歌。在无产阶级文化大革命中，指战员们以“空中狠揍美国狼，地面痛打落水狗”，“敌机来了打敌机，敌机不来批《修养》”的革命气概，对中国赫鲁晓夫的代表作《修养》进行了大张旗鼓的口诛笔伐，彻底剥掉了《修养》的画皮，认清了《修养》是彻头彻尾的反马列主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草，是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的黑纲领。破字当头，立在其中。通过大批《修养》，掀起了大学“老三篇”、大闹思想革命化的新高潮。这样，打起仗来，千百人构成一个战斗的整体，全力以赴，为着务歼入侵之敌的同一个目标而战，就每战必胜。在一次战斗中，海军航空兵某部僚机飞行员吕纪良，发现长机进入拉烟层，拉出白烟容易暴露自己，及时提醒长机改变高度，隐蔽接敌。当长机王柱书开炮击中敌机时，他又追上去补上一串炮弹，把敌机打得空中开花。
    一年来击落击伤敌机十四架的光辉战绩，还是大树特树毛主席军事路线绝对权威的结果。多年来，毛主席的建军路线同资产阶级建军路线的斗争，一直是集中在政治第一还是军事第一，突出政治还是突出军事这个根本问题上。突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。无产阶级文化大革命中，指战员们遵照林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起了批判资产阶级军事路线的空前热潮，狠批了彭德怀、罗瑞卿军事第一、技术第一，以资产阶级的正规化现代化反对无产阶级革命化，搞大比武、折衷主义、冲击政治，以及不要人民战争、不依靠人民群众的军阀主义和单纯军事观点等等一套修正主义货色，大破了一切违反毛泽东思想的旧条条、洋框框，大立了毛主席军事路线的绝对权威，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想统帅作战、统帅一切。最近击落敌人Ｕ—2型高空侦察机的空军部队在战斗中，指挥员始终用毛主席语录指挥作战，战斗员用毛主席语录互相鼓励，斗志极其高昂，愈战愈勇，愈战愈强，终于把敌机揍了下来。毛泽东思想真正成了统帅作战全过程的最强大的精神原子弹。
    林副主席说：“毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。”指战员们深切体会到这是千真万确的真理。
