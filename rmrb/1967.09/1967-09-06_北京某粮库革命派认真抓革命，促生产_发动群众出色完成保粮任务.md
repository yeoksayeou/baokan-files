Editor's Note: Properly preserving grain is a major task in implementing Chairman Mao's call for "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." This summer's grain harvest was abundant, and this autumn is expected to yield another good harvest. Additionally, this year has seen more rain, higher temperatures, and greater humidity, making the grain preservation task particularly arduous.

Revolutionary factions of the proletariat on the grain front should, like the revolutionary faction of a certain grain depot in Beijing, mobilize the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm through meticulous political and ideological work to excellently complete the grain preservation task.

Revolutionary comrades on the grain front should prioritize the overall and national interests. Regardless of the differences between this organization and that, they should unite as one to properly preserve the grain for the nation without missing the opportunity.

Report: After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction of a certain grain depot in Beijing has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promoting the revolution, and vigorously advancing production, excellently completing the grain preservation task.

This summer's grain harvest was abundant, making the grain preservation task particularly arduous. In the first eight months of this year, the warehouse preservation task increased significantly compared to previous years. Class struggle in society was sharp and complex, making the work even more arduous. However, the proletarian revolutionary faction is not afraid of difficulties. They said: Doing a good job in grain preservation is a major issue of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and it is a major task related to the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must firmly and unwaveringly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grabbing the revolution and promoting production." On one hand, they exposed the plots and tricks of the capitalist-roaders within the Party who attempted to sabotage production. On the other hand, they conducted extensive political and ideological work among the broad masses who had been deceived, winning over the majority of workers and cadres. They insisted on conducting the revolution in their spare time and "saving to conduct the revolution," ensuring the completion of storage, release, and supply tasks under any circumstances.

This year, with more rain, higher humidity, and higher temperatures, pests bred rapidly, bringing many difficulties to the preservation work. Revolutionary comrades demonstrated a high sense of responsibility, treating the depot as their home, checking and covering grain in the rain. An old worker fell and broke his teeth during a night patrol but still insisted on working. During a violent storm on July 15, revolutionary comrades bravely covered the grain positions, fighting the storm for over two hours, ensuring that the national grain was not damaged. The masses deceived by a handful of capitalist-roaders were deeply moved by the revolutionary faction's exemplary behavior and actively joined the revolutionary comrades in the battle to cover the grain. The revolutionary faction also mobilized the masses to insist on grain preservation regulations, timely organizing several mass inspections to ensure that grain conditions were known and that grain was safely stored through the summer. They also organized specialized pest control teams to thoroughly eradicate pests.

With the increase in grain storage, there was a shortage of covering materials. The revolutionary faction responded to Chairman Mao's call to "save to conduct the revolution," using stones and bricks to replace sleepers and mobilizing the masses to use wooden poles, sackcloth, and repair old, discarded sackcloth to solve the problem of insufficient materials, excellently completing the grain reception task.

During the summer grain collection and storage work, the loading and unloading speed broke the highest record ever. The grain depot also actively accepted part of the damp wheat that production teams could not dry, taking over the drying. The peasants said, "Only the proletarian revolutionary faction truly serves agricultural production!"

　　北京某粮库革命派认真抓革命，促生产
　　发动群众出色完成保粮任务
    编者按：保管好粮食，是实现毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”伟大号召的大事。今年夏粮丰收，秋季又将有一个好收成，加上今年雨水多、气温高、湿度大，粮食保管任务十分繁重。
    粮食战线上的无产阶级革命派，应当象北京某粮库的革命派那样，通过深入细致的政治思想工作，把广大群众的革命积极性调动起来，出色地完成粮食保管任务。
    粮食战线上的革命同志，应该以全局利益为重，以国家利益为重，不管这个组织和那个组织之间有多少分歧，在为国家保管好粮食这个问题上应当团结一致，不误时机地把粮食管好。
    本报讯　北京市某粮库无产阶级革命派，在掌权以后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，出色地完成了保粮任务。
    今年夏粮大丰收，粮食保管任务十分繁重。今年头八个月，仓库保管任务比往年增长幅度比较大，社会上的阶级斗争又是尖锐复杂的，工作更加艰巨。但是无产阶级革命派是不怕困难的，他们说：做好粮食保管工作，是“备战、备荒、为人民”的大问题，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命顺利进行的大事，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们一方面揭穿了党内走资本主义道路当权派企图破坏生产的阴谋诡计，一方面对广大受蒙蔽的群众，进行了大量的政治思想工作，争取团结了职工和干部的大多数。他们坚持业余闹革命和“要节约闹革命”，在任何情况下，都能保证完成入库、出库、供应的任务。
    今年雨水多，湿度大，气温高，害虫繁殖快，给保管工作带来了不少困难。革命派的同志们发扬了高度的负责精神，以库为家，冒雨检查、抢苫粮食。一个老工人夜间巡逻时摔坏了牙齿，仍然坚持工作。在七月十五日的一次暴风雨中，革命派的同志奋勇抢苫货位，同暴风雨进行了两个多小时的大搏斗，保卫了国家粮食没受任何损失。受一小撮走资本主义道路当权派蒙蔽的群众，深深为革命派的这种模范行为所感动，也主动跑到现场和革命派的同志一起投入抢苫粮食的战斗。革命派还发动广大群众坚持了保粮制度，不失时机地组织了几次群众性的大普查，做到粮情心中有数，保证了粮食安全度夏。他们还组织了专门防治队伍，认真除治虫害。
    粮食库存加大，遇到了苫垫器材不足的困难。革命派响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，没有枕木，用石头和砖代替，没有茓子作囤，就发动群众利用木杆、草袋和缝补废旧茓子，解决了器材不足的问题，很好地完成了接粮任务。
    在夏征入库工作中，抢装抢卸，装卸速度打破了历来的最高纪录。粮库还主动接收了生产队无法晾晒的部分湿小麦，代替烘干。社员说：“无产阶级革命派才真正是为农业生产服务啊！”
