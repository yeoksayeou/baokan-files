The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in order to earn foreign exchange, has in recent years been actively promoting tourism for Western capitalist tourists and has widely established "foreign exchange shops."

Soviet revisionist publications have repeatedly proclaimed 1967 as the "International Tourism Year," planning to "receive 15 million foreign tourists to visit the Soviet Union." To attract tourists, as early as last October 24, the Soviet "International Tourism Service" invited nearly 50 countries' tourism organizations and representatives from 300 travel agencies to Moscow to hold a "Conference of Foreign Travel Agencies and Transportation Companies." The Soviet revisionists have created every convenience for Western tourists, increasing flights and simplifying entry procedures. Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, Zaporozhye, Yalta, and other Soviet cities are undergoing major construction to build high-class hotels, even constructing so-called "car hotels" and "outdoor hotels" to cater to Western dignitaries.

According to reports, Moscow has newly built hotels with 4,500 rooms and 8,100 beds. The hotel area in the city center is expected to double. At the same time, the Soviet revisionist authorities are hastening to train reception personnel. Currently, a large number of hotel workers are learning foreign languages, and this year, 3,500 "reception experts" will be trained.

The Soviet revisionists have opened many foreign exchange shops in various major cities in the Soviet Union, especially in Moscow. Foreign exchange shops and small stores are also set up at airports and large hotels. In May of this year, at the "Food Exhibition of 22 Countries" held in Sokolniki Park in Moscow, the Soviet revisionists did not forget to set up a large temporary foreign exchange shop. The foreign exchange shops or small stores opened by the Soviet revisionists all have signs saying "Foreign Exchange Only." Usually, they only accept dollars, pounds, francs, and West German marks. Some places also accept Japanese and Yugoslav currencies. Ordinary Soviet citizens are barred from entering.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, by opening the door, is making every effort to attract Western capitalist tourists. Apart from seeking economic benefits, it is also a means of tightening ties and collusion with imperialism.

    招徕西方游客　广设外汇商店　兴建高级旅馆
　　苏修煞费苦心捞取外汇
    新华社讯　莫斯科消息：苏修统治集团为了捞取外汇，近年来大做起招徕西方资产阶级游客的生意，并广设“外汇商店”。
    苏修报刊一再宣扬一九六七年是“国际旅行年”，计划“接待一百五十万外国旅行者访问苏联”。为了吸引游客，早在去年十月二十四日，苏联的“国际旅行服务社”就邀请了近五十个国家的旅行社和组织的三百名代表，在莫斯科举行“外国旅行社和运输公司代表会议”。苏修并为西方游客创造一切方便条件，增设班机，简化入境手续。莫斯科、基辅、哈尔科夫、敖德萨、扎波罗热、雅尔塔和其它一些苏联城市，正在大兴土木，修建高级旅馆，甚至还建造了纯粹迎合西方显贵们的什么“汽车旅馆和野外旅馆”。
    据报道，莫斯科已新建了包括四千五百个房间、拥有八千一百个床位的旅馆。市中心的旅馆面积大约将增加一倍。与此同时，苏修当局正在加紧训练招待人员。现在大批旅馆工作人员正学外语，今年还将训练出三千五百名“招待工作专家”。
    苏修在苏联的各大城市，尤其在莫斯科，开设了许多专收外汇的商店。在机场和大旅馆也都设有外汇商店和小卖部。今年五月，在莫斯科索科利尼基公园举行的“二十二国食品展览会”上，苏修也不忘记设立一个巨大的临时外汇商店。苏修开设的外汇商店或外汇小卖部都挂着“只收外汇”的牌子。通常情况下，只收美元、英镑、法郎和西德的马克。有的地方也收日本和南斯拉夫的货币。普通的苏联人被拒之门外。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团开放门户，极力招徕西方资产阶级游客，除了捞取经济实惠外，也是同帝国主义加紧勾结和来往的一个途径。
