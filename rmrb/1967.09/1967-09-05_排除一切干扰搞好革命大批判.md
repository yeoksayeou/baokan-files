At a crucial moment when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is achieving victory after victory across the country, and when the clique of capitalists within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, is on the verge of total collapse, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has issued an important battle command.

We, the Red Guards of Hohhot, solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts: We will immediately take action, root the Party Central Committee's orders in our minds, and implement them in our actions. We will swiftly push the revolutionary criticism to a new high, concentrate our firepower, and focus our targets to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Of all the tasks, revolutionary criticism is the first; of all the efforts, if we do not focus on revolutionary criticism, all other efforts are in vain. Revolutionary criticism is an essential part of the struggle for power. Only by thoroughly eliminating the poison of China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically can we fundamentally consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without political, ideological, and theoretical seizure of power, organizational seizure of power cannot be guaranteed, and even if it is achieved, it cannot be consolidated. Chairman Mao said: "A new social system must be established on the basis of the old system, and it must clear away this basis." Only by uprooting the poison of revisionism can Chairman Mao's revolutionary line be carried out to the end, the power of the proletariat be consolidated, and the new socialist system be consolidated and developed.

Therefore, we must regard revolutionary criticism as a continuation of the struggle for power. Some comrades think that once power is seized organizationally, the revolution is successful, and they can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Some comrades think that once the handful of capitalists within the party are exposed, they are defeated, and thus do not pay much attention to their criticism and struggle. In short, they do not fully understand the great significance of revolutionary criticism and do not realize that without a good revolutionary criticism, the power seized by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is in danger of being taken away at any time. Therefore, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, highlight proletarian politics, exclude all disturbances, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate our firepower, focus our targets, and conduct a thorough revolutionary criticism.

Especially, we must see that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is on the front line of anti-revisionism. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and guard against all sabotage by class enemies. China's Khrushchev and foreign Khrushchev are poisonous gourds on the same vine. Striking China's Khrushchev hurts foreign Khrushchev. Therefore, we must use criticism to respond to the provocations of the running dogs of Soviet revisionism, and submerge the handful of capitalists within the party and their agents in Inner Mongolia in the vast sea of criticism.

Revolutionary comrades, let us seize the current favorable revolutionary situation, together with the revolutionary masses across the country, exclude all disturbances, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois headquarters, and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

　　排除一切干扰搞好革命大批判
　　呼和浩特大中（专）院校红卫兵第三司令部
    正当以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派走向全面崩溃，全国各地的无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的重要关头，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，发出了重要的战斗号令。
    我们呼和浩特市全体红卫兵，向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席宣誓：我们一定立即行动起来，把党中央的号令扎根到思想上，落实到行动中，迅速地把革命的大批判推向一个新的高潮，集中火力，集中目标，从政治、思想、理论上批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人。
    千条万条，革命大批判是第一条；千抓万抓，不抓革命大批判就是瞎抓。革命的大批判是夺权斗争的重要组成部分，只有从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，才能从根本上巩固无产阶级专政。没有政治上、思想上、理论上的夺权，就不能保证组织上夺权的胜利，胜利了也不可能巩固。毛主席说：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。”只有铲除修正主义毒根，毛主席的革命路线才能贯彻到底，无产阶级的政权才能巩固，崭新的社会主义制度才能巩固和发展。
    因此，我们必须把革命的大批判看作夺权斗争的继续。我们有的同志认为，组织上夺了权，革命就算成功了，可以坐下来吃老本了；有的同志认为，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，这就等于把他们打倒了，因而就不再重视对他们的批判和斗争了。总之，他们对革命大批判的重大意义不很理解，不懂得不搞好革命的大批判，无产阶级革命派夺来的权，随时都有重新被人夺走的危险。因此，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，排除一切干扰，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，集中火力，集中目标，搞好革命的大批判。
    特别要看到，内蒙古自治区处于反修前线。我们务必要提高革命警惕性，严防一切阶级敌人的破坏。中国赫鲁晓夫和外国赫鲁晓夫是一条藤上的毒瓜，打在中国赫鲁晓夫的身上，痛在外国赫鲁晓夫的心上。因而，我们一定要用大批判来回答苏联修正主义的走狗的挑衅，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他在内蒙古的代理人通通淹没在大批判的汪洋大海中。
    革命的战友们，让我们乘当前一派大好革命形势，同全国革命派一起，排除一切干扰，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向资产阶级司令部发起全面的攻击，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
