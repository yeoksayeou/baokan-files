Advocating the "Parliamentary Road" is a Betrayal of the Revolution
Hong Ren Da

In 1960, China's Khrushchev blatantly said: "Some revolutionary parties in Latin American countries still have legal status and can engage in legal activities, and do not need to wage armed struggle." Here, the so-called "legal activities" refer to the "parliamentary struggle" that he advocates. This is the prescription that China's Khrushchev offers for the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

The bourgeois parliament has always been a decoration for bourgeois dictatorship. The proletariat cannot seize power through the "parliamentary road" but must rely on the gun, using revolutionary violence to overthrow bourgeois dictatorship. Because all reactionary ruling classes will not voluntarily exit the historical stage; they always rely on violence to maintain their rule.

The historical experience of the international communist movement has already declared the bankruptcy of the "parliamentary road." After World War II, the revisionists in France and Italy followed a line of compromise and surrender, handing over the hundreds of thousands of people's armed forces established during the anti-fascist war to the bourgeoisie in exchange for the temporary positions of "deputy prime minister," "minister," and "member of parliament." The result was a total loss, which is a clear example. Since the "parliamentary road" does not work in capitalist countries, it is even more a dead end for countries that have not yet achieved complete independence and do not even have a bourgeois parliament.

Chairman Mao once pointed out that in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, "the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter into insurrection and war through long-term legal struggle, nor is it to first seize cities and then rural areas, but to take the opposite road."

Many countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have political and economic conditions similar to those of old China. Chairman Mao's revolutionary truth is completely applicable to the revolutions in these countries and regions.

The United States imperialism, which has always regarded Latin America as its "backyard," is everywhere in Latin American countries, instigating subversive activities, establishing military dictatorships, and using armed forces to suppress the people's revolutionary struggles.

In such circumstances, China's Khrushchev shamelessly talks about how some revolutionary parties in Latin American countries can engage in legal activities and do not need to wage armed struggle. This is not only whitewashing U.S. imperialism and its running dogs but also a shameful betrayal of the national liberation cause!

China's Khrushchev completely inherits the mantle of the Second International revisionism and wears the same pants as the Soviet modern revisionists. It is precisely the Soviet modern revisionists who vigorously advocate that Asian, African, and Latin American countries can gain liberation from imperialist shackles through peaceful struggle means, that the value of the masses in Asia, Africa, and Latin America using universal suffrage and parliamentary systems to engage in political struggle should not be underestimated, and so on. China's Khrushchev sings in harmony with them, and their traitorous faces are so similar!

The revisionist goods that China's Khrushchev advocates are in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism. People still remember that after the great traitor Khrushchev threw out the "peaceful transition" line at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, U.S. imperialism felt "satisfied." The role that China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies play in U.S. imperialism's implementation of its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy is not obvious?

China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the fallacies of "legalism" and the "parliamentary road" has deep historical roots. During the entire democratic revolution period in our country, he has always opposed Chairman Mao's line of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed force, advocating a line of surrenderism, and promoting the "parliamentary road." In 1946, he again proposed the infamous fallacy of the "new stage of peaceful democracy," advocating "not going through civil war," entering the city through "ballots," "establishing a parliament," and "building a parliamentary system" to "achieve the success of the democratic revolution." This fully illustrates that China's Khrushchev is a die-hard "parliamentary fanatic." The practice of the Chinese revolution has already proven that his fallacies have completely failed. His revisionist trash will also be burned to ashes by the blazing flames of the armed struggles of the people's revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

　　鼓吹“议会道路”就是背叛革命
　　宏任达
    中国赫鲁晓夫在一九六○年曾露骨地说过：“有些拉丁美洲国家革命的政党还有合法地位，可以进行合法活动，可以不搞武装斗争”。这里所谓的“合法活动”，就是他所鼓吹的“议会斗争”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫为殖民地、半殖民地民族解放运动所开的药方。
    资产阶级议会从来是资产阶级专政的装饰品。无产阶级不可能通过“议会道路”取得政权，而必须靠枪杆子，用革命的暴力推翻资产阶级专政。因为一切反动统治阶级都不会自动地退出历史舞台，他们总是要依靠暴力维持自己的统治。
    国际共产主义运动的历史经验，早就宣告了“议会道路”的破产。第二次世界大战后，法国和意大利的修正主义者实行妥协投降的路线，把在反法西斯战争中建立起来的几十万人民武装拱手交给资产阶级，暂时换取了“副总理”、“部长”和“议员”的席位，结果是鸡飞蛋打，就是明显的例证。既然“议会道路”在资本主义国家走不通，对于那些尚未取得完全独立、甚至连资产阶级议会也还没有的国家，更是一条绝路。
    毛主席曾经指出，在半殖民地、半封建的中国，“共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区不少国家的政治、经济的基本状况，同旧中国有许多共同点。毛主席的这一革命真理，完全适用于这些国家和地区的革命。
    一向把拉丁美洲当成自己“后院”的美帝国主义，在拉丁美洲各国到处策动颠覆活动，建立军事独裁政权，武装镇压人民革命斗争。
    在这种情况下，中国赫鲁晓夫竟无耻地胡说什么有些拉丁美洲国家革命的政党可以进行合法活动，可以不搞武装斗争，这不仅是为美帝国主义及其走狗涂脂抹粉，而且是对民族解放事业的可耻背叛！
    中国赫鲁晓夫完全继承了第二国际修正主义的衣钵，并且同苏联现代修正主义者穿一条连裆裤。正是苏联现代修正主义者，竭力鼓吹什么亚、非、拉国家“可以借助于和平斗争手段”从帝国主义的枷锁下获得解放，什么不应低估亚、非、拉群众“利用普选和议会制”进行政治斗争的“价值”，等等。而中国的赫鲁晓夫和他们一唱一和，其叛徒嘴脸何其相似！
    中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的这一套修正主义货色，是适应美帝国主义的需要的。人们还记得，大叛徒赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十次代表大会上抛出“和平过渡”的纲领以后，就曾使美帝国主义深感“满意”。中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的修正主义谬论在美帝国主义推行其反革命两手策略方面，所扮演的是什么角色，不是昭然若揭吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“合法主义”、“议会道路”的谬论是有其深刻的历史根源的。在我国整个民主革命时期，他一贯同毛主席关于农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的路线相对抗，鼓吹投降主义路线，宣扬“议会道路”。一九四六年，他又提出臭名昭著的“和平民主新阶段”的谬论，主张“不经过内战”，通过“选票进城”、“成立议会”、“建立议会制度”，来“达到民主革命成功”。这就充分说明了中国赫鲁晓夫是一个地地道道的老牌“议会迷”。中国革命的实践早已证明他的这套谬论彻底破产了。他的这套修正主义破烂货，也必将被亚、非、拉各国人民革命武装斗争的熊熊烈火烧成灰烬。
