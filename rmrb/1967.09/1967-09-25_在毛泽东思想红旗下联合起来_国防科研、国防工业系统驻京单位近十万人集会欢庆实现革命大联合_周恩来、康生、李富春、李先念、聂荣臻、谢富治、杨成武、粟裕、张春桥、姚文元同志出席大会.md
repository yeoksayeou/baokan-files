		Xinhua News Agency, September 24th — Nearly 100,000 revolutionary masses from the defense science and technology and defense industry systems stationed in Beijing held a rally at the Beijing Workers' Stadium on the afternoon of the 23rd to celebrate their great victory in achieving revolutionary unity under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. This vast proletarian revolutionary army, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, will concentrate their firepower and targets, fiercely criticize and struggle against the capitalist roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. In the great criticism of the revolution, they will break with the private and establish the public, promote the revolutionization of thought, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		Comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan attended the meeting.

		On that day, the Beijing Workers' Stadium was filled with a warm atmosphere of unity and struggle. Inside the stadium, there were large banners reading: "Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionaries unite!" and "Firmly complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation!" The revolutionary masses who have created glory in the battle to scale the heights of defense science and technology gathered together, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, to celebrate the new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The meeting began with the song "The East Is Red," followed by the entire audience reciting Chairman Mao's quotations: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees of our cause's victory."

		Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen spoke at the meeting. He said that the revolutionary masses of the defense science and technology and defense industry systems stationed in Beijing have learned the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and in the high tide of revolutionary criticism, on the eve of National Day, insisted on revolutionary principles and achieved revolutionary unity. This is a brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a brilliant victory of the proletarian revolutionary line, and a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

		He said that revolutionary unity has a common ideological foundation. Only by achieving revolutionary unity in thought can organizational unity be consolidated and developed. Revolutionary masses must further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate petty-bourgeois factionalism, firmly establish proletarian party spirit, and resolutely safeguard the overall interests, the interests of the proletariat, and the interests of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must resolutely be revolutionaries of Mao Zedong Thought!

		Vice Premier Nie said that in the process of achieving revolutionary unity, many new problems and new things will emerge. This requires the left-supporting personnel of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary leading cadres to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and humbly learn and summarize the new experiences created by the masses in the movement. They must grasp living thoughts, timely correct those erroneous thoughts that do not meet the requirements of revolutionary unity and do not conform to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

		Central Military Commission member and Deputy Minister of Defense Su Yu delivered the opening speech. He said that over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres of the defense science and technology and defense industry systems stationed in Beijing have achieved great results and major victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, we proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have united and combined our forces. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launch an unprecedented scale of revolutionary criticism. We must grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, science and technology, preparedness, and work, and make the defense science and technology and defense industry systems into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

		Representatives of the revolutionary masses from the defense science and technology and defense industry systems stationed in Beijing spoke at the meeting. They said that in the face of a great situation across the country, our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao issued new instructions to the proletarian revolutionaries nationwide: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's new battle cry is a guiding light for the proletarian revolutionaries to achieve revolutionary unity and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With immense excitement, we report to our great leader and to our comrades in the proletarian revolutionary ranks: We have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings with the most resolute determination and the fastest pace, insisted on the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, and achieved revolutionary unity. This victory embodies the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. Chairman Mao's words are the highest, most authoritative, and most powerful. Every word is the truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. As soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will act immediately and resolutely carry it out. To defend the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we proletarian revolutionaries dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire! The sea may dry up, and the rocks may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! Our heads may be cut off, and our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned!

		Amidst thunderous applause, the meeting passed a message of respect to Chairman Mao.

		Representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries from the PLA's army, navy, and air force units in Beijing attended the meeting to extend warm congratulations.

		Also present at the meeting were PLA leaders Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chiming, Wu Faxian, Chang Qinkun, Li Zuopeng, Zhang Xiuquan, Chen Renqing, Li Tianhuan, Chen Shipeng, Tan Furen, Huang Zhiyong, Li Zhen, Jiang Wen, Luo Huasheng, Liu Zhong, Song Weizhi, Zheng Weishan, Chen Xianrui, Fu Chongbi, Huang Yongsheng, Chen Xilian, Xiang Zhonghua, Luo Xunzhi, Cai Shunli, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhenhan, and others.
