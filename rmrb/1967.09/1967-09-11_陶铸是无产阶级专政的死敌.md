Tao Zhu, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, has for over a decade consistently followed the party's top capitalist-roaders, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, with tenfold frenzy and hundredfold hatred, striving to oppose and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, plotting to restore capitalism. He advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle, propagating the capitalist road. He opposes the great thought of Mao Zedong, spreading poisonous ideas of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, creating public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration. He is the vanguard of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, opposing the party, opposing socialism, opposing the thought of Mao Zedong, and is an enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must fight him to the end and overthrow and expose him!

	In socialist society, do classes and class struggle still exist? Is the dictatorship of the proletariat still necessary? This is a key issue that relates to whether the socialist revolution will be carried through to the end, and it is a major issue concerning the future of our socialist country.

	As early as 1949, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that after the nationwide victory, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is the fundamental contradiction within our country; the people must exercise dictatorship over the reactionary classes and reactionaries. In February 1957, in the brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense."

	In April of that year, China's Khrushchev openly contradicted Chairman Mao, claiming that "now, domestic enemies have been basically eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated, and counter-revolutionaries have been basically eliminated. We say that the class struggle among the main classes within the country has basically ended." Tao Zhu immediately followed suit, parroting China's Khrushchev's tune, repeatedly emphasizing in his speeches after April that year that "class contradictions have basically been eliminated" and "class struggle has basically ended."

	Tao Zhu and his master, China's Khrushchev, thus vigorously advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, deliberately obscuring the objective reality of class and class struggle, intending to lull the revolutionary will of the proletariat, so that they, this group of counter-revolutionaries, can boldly and freely peddle capitalist and revisionist goods, ultimately achieving the evil goal of turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

	Tao Zhu has consistently opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whenever class struggle becomes sharp and intense, he jumps out to advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, standing on the side of the class enemy, fiercely attacking the party and maliciously attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	In 1955, when we exposed the heinous crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and launched a nationwide rectification movement, Tao Zhu openly sympathized with the counter-revolutionaries, claiming that "the current situation of hidden counter-revolutionaries on the Chinese mainland is miserable, their mood is painful, not very pleasant." This is truly the sentiment and logic of a counter-revolutionary! To make counter-revolutionaries "feel pleasant," it is necessary to throw the working people into the abyss! Tao Zhu, standing on the counter-revolutionary side, feels pity for the fallen fox, so he repeatedly shouted, "We should first be lenient with counter-revolutionaries." He wants counter-revolutionaries to go free, waiting for the opportunity to return and drown the dictatorship of the proletariat in blood, achieving counter-revolutionary restoration.

	In 1957, when the bourgeois rightists began to fiercely attack the party and socialism, Tao Zhu came out and shouted, "Now the enemy has been defeated, there is no need for revolution, now the main task is to focus on production," "class struggle has basically been eliminated." He vigorously advocated "weakening the dictatorial power of the government, shifting to leading production, organizing the economic life of the people, and adjusting contradictions among the people"; he also said, "The Hungarian incident will definitely not happen in our China,... everyone can sleep well," "even if there are slogans like 'overthrow the Communist Party,' we should first check if we have any mistakes." People have seen all kinds of traitors, but such a traitor as Tao Zhu, who kneels before the enemy and says that the revolutionaries are wrong, has not been seen before. Truly, if traitors were compared to lice, even lice would feel humiliated.

	After Chairman Mao issued the call, when the people of the entire country were counter-attacking the rightists, Tao Zhu still openly said, "The struggle against the rightists cannot be said to be a struggle between enemies and us." Of course, for Tao Zhu, rightists and all reactionaries are "internal contradictions" rather than "enemy" issues, because Tao Zhu himself is a big boss of the bourgeois rightists! So he so brazenly encouraged and covered up the rightists' attacks on the party.

	In 1959, when the right-opportunists Peng Dehuai and others fiercely attacked the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the three red banners, Tao Zhu came out to encourage them, telling them to "never yield to adverse conditions" and to "endure the storms and rains." Later, when China's Khrushchev blew the wind of rehabilitation for the right-opportunists, he jumped out again and shouted, "After making mistakes, these three red banners should be said to have faded," maliciously attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat for "breeding bureaucracy"; on the other hand, he also winked at the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, saying, "After the anti-rightist struggle, the issue of the two roads has basically been resolved, in the future, the party should trust each other, strengthen unity, and work together," "We should make friends." He made friends with the class enemies, so he bluntly declared, "We have no class contradictions, it is a contradiction between subjectivity and objectivity." Tao Zhu's theory of the extinction of class struggle is truly at its peak, far surpassing the level of general new and old revisionists.

	In 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao made a report on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society, issuing the great battle call to "never forget class struggle," completely exposing the conspiracy of Tao Zhu and his ilk. However, after this, Tao Zhu still openly opposed Chairman Mao, claiming that "the exploiting class has basically been eliminated," "anyone who engages in class struggle and affects and hinders production is wrong," "the bourgeoisie is no longer a complete class, it is a residual class." He also praised this "residual" class, saying that China's bourgeoisie is "revolutionary," is "socialist," is the "most beautiful bourgeoisie in the world." He is such a slave who kneels before the bourgeoisie!

	Enough, from these materials, we can see clearly that Tao Zhu advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle to allow a handful of counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and capitalist-roaders within the party to "feel pleasant" and brazenly engage in restoration activities, allowing Tao Zhu and his ilk to "work together," secretly turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

	After the founding of New China, the most fundamental and important question facing the people of the entire country is: Where is China heading? Chairman Mao pointed out: "The facts have already answered this question: Only socialism can save China."

	The establishment of the People's Republic of China marked the basic end of the stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao timely put forward the general line for the transitional period, requiring us to immediately carry out socialist transformation after the completion of land reform, develop the socialist economy, establish a new economic foundation for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and push the revolution forward. In contrast, the top capitalist-roader within the party said, "China is not short of capitalism, but lacks capitalism," proposing slogans such as "consolidating the new democratic order" and "guaranteeing private property," vigorously resisting the socialist transformation of the means of production. Tao Zhu closely followed his master, proposing in 1953 that "we must stabilize the new production relations, protect the initiative of private ownership, and develop productive forces." For this, he vigorously advocated "getting rich through hard work," vigorously promoting the "four freedoms" of buying and selling land, lending, hiring labor, and trade, and absurdly proposing that party members and cadres should take the lead in lending money, not fearing the "hat of exploitation," desperately resisting socialist transformation, attempting to stop the Chinese revolution, gradually realizing his dream of bourgeois dictatorship.

	After the national implementation of cooperativization, regarding this newly established socialist economic system, should we wholeheartedly support it, consolidate it, and develop it, or attack it and sabotage it? This is another sharp struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines on the economic front.

	Chairman Mao timely pointed out: "The new social system has just been established and needs a period of consolidation." Chairman Mao called on the people of the entire country to continue the socialist revolution on the economic front and resolutely strike down capitalist tendencies. At this time, the top capitalist-roader within the party again advocated the free competition and free development of capitalist economy and socialist economy, and began to slash agricultural producers' cooperatives. Tao Zhu also followed his master, undermining the foundations of socialism. In 1957, taking advantage of the opportunity when the bourgeois rightists fiercely attacked the party and socialism, he stirred up a black wind of withdrawing from cooperatives. He vigorously advocated that "agricultural producers' cooperative members who want to withdraw should be completely allowed to withdraw, they have complete freedom, and it is also legal." Attempting to disintegrate and sabotage the socialist collective economy.

	In 1958, a brilliant and glorious page was opened in the history of our great motherland's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The people's communes, like a red sun, rose from the eastern horizon. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the three red banners, fluttered in the wind, displaying the great determination and great wisdom of the laboring people of our country under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, displaying the tremendous power of revolutionary mass movements.

	Tao Zhu jumped out at this time, together with the top capitalist-roader within the party and the right-opportunists Peng Dehuai and others, in coordination with the fierce attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies, maliciously slandering the Central Committee of the party as "having lost their minds," "moving too fast." After 1960, he fiercely launched a comprehensive attack on the three red banners. This mad counter-revolutionary revisionist, with his eyes closed, did not see the promotion of the thought revolution of the people of the entire country by the three red banners, did not see the great achievements made under the guidance of the three red banners, did not see the rich experience created by the three red banners for our socialist revolution and socialist construction, did not see the great role played by the three red banners in resisting the three-year natural disasters and in resisting the sabotage of the Soviet revisionists against us, and maliciously slandered and defamed our great socialist cause, saying that we were building "a poor and painful socialism." At the same time, he actively advocated building a so-called "rich and happy socialism." How to achieve the "rich and happy socialism" he wanted? Look at the prescription he opened: On November 10, 1960, at a telephone conference held by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, he said, "We are not afraid of spontaneous forces, now it is not that there are too many spontaneous forces, but that we are controlling too tightly." This is to let capitalist economy spread rampantly.

	In December of the same year, at the three-level cadres' conference in Guangdong Province, he said, "Even if there is some capitalist spontaneous activity, at most it will produce a few 'petty capitalist merchants,' what is there to be afraid of!" This is to cultivate new bourgeois elements.

	Under this guidance, he vigorously promoted "contracting production to households," actively "restored rural markets," encouraged "unrestricted private reclamation," and even openly proposed the slogan of "single farming is allowed."

	It is clear that Tao Zhu's prescription is a thorough prescription for restoring capitalism!

	In the prosperous development of the socialist economy, is it proletarian politics in command, or is it advocating material incentives, making the socialist economy degenerate into a capitalist economy? This is the key issue in the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines on the economic front.

	Like all new and old revisionists, Tao Zhu has consistently opposed emphasizing politics. Soon after the land reform, he had proposed the slogan of "production above all" and "full force to production." When the socialist collective economy was increasingly developing and consolidating, he, like the top capitalist-roader within the party, in order to make the socialist economy degenerate and change its nature, even more vigorously advocated "production first" and material incentives. In 1961, he openly declared, "In the past, we did things through political means,... not only did we not achieve anything, but we also destroyed production, the more we did, the less we had, now we should adopt economic means." He slandered political work as "talking nonsense," "firing blanks," "cannot be eaten as food." He advocated that "the production viewpoint is the concentrated expression of our mass viewpoint, whether there is a production viewpoint or not is the touchstone of whether there is a mass viewpoint." Like another top capitalist-roader within the party, he also advocated "a black cat or a white cat, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," "increasing production is Marxism-Leninism, decreasing production is subjectivism." In the "eight points" proposed by Tao Zhu himself for building a new socialist countryside, there was not a single point about politics. Even the great socialist education movement, he put "cleaning up politics" in an extremely secondary position. Tao Zhu's opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics inevitably emphasized bourgeois politics, making "material incentives," "profit incentives," "bonus incentives" rampant, leading to the restoration of capitalism.

	In fact, Tao Zhu, starting from the viewpoint of "production first," brought over the entire set of Soviet revisionist methods. He encouraged party committees at all levels to focus on production, to become "pig-raising party committees," "grain party committees," "greening party committees." If we were to follow Tao Zhu's methods, our factories and villages would become breeding grounds for revisionism and nests for the restoration of capitalism, our party would become a bourgeois, revisionist party; the socialist system of ownership would change its nature, and the economic foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat would be hollowed out by parasites, vampires, speculators, and other vermin. Tao Zhu's sinister intentions are here!

	Chairman Mao taught us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion, one must first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Tao Zhu, this cunning bourgeois agent, is very aware of the power of "killing with a soft knife." He vigorously promoted literature, art, news, education, and other fields, attempting to use these positions to spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, resist the great thought of Mao Zedong, and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

	First, he resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, distorting Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: We must make culture and art a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking down the enemy, and annihilating the enemy. Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is a firm class policy of the proletariat. It serves to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and to carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in the ideological sphere. However, Tao Zhu used the method of "stealing heaven and changing day" to remove its class content, stuffing in the black goods of bourgeois liberalization to meet the needs of the bourgeoisie. He repeatedly advocated: "What ideology, what school of thought, what arguments, should all be allowed to exist, let them 'bloom' and 'contend,'" and "cannot 'bloom' only for you, not for me, cannot 'contend' only for you, not for me." He used every means to fight for the position and speaking rights of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and to cancel the struggle of the proletariat against these ideological enemies. Under his advocacy and support, the literary and art circles in Guangdong and Central South were filled with dark clouds, and demons danced wildly. On the stage, the main characters were not workers, peasants, and soldiers, not the creators of world history, the people, but emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and monsters. In literary and art works, poisonous weeds such as "Three Families Lane," "Struggle," "Gems from the Sea of Art," "Flower City," "Notes on Tang Poetry," and "Festival in Shaoshan" sprouted and spread poison nationwide. In the film industry, reactionary films such as "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles," "The King of Qi Seeks Generals," "Liu Mingzhu," and "South China Tide" flooded the screens, poisoning the audience. Tao Zhu also, following the instructions of the top capitalist-roader within the party, advocated the "spirit of Hai Rui," praising "Bao Zheng seeking justice for the people," cheering for the right-opportunists, and rehabilitating the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai who had been removed from office, directly pointing the spearhead at the Central Committee of the party and Chairman Mao. Tao Zhu also personally went into battle, firing two poisonous arrows, "Ideal, Morality, Spiritual Life" and "Thought, Emotion, Literary Talent." When Tao Zhu's evil conspiracy to let ghosts and monsters come out was resisted and criticized by the broad revolutionary masses, he immediately revealed a ferocious appearance, claiming, "Some of our comrades have a face of 'autumn wind is chilly,'" "when the autumn wind blows, the leaves fall off, what is there to 'let a hundred flowers bloom'?" Tao Zhu's so-called "blooming" and "contending" actually allowed ghosts and monsters to bark and shout wildly for the restoration of capitalism, but did not allow the proletariat to criticize and counterattack the landlord bourgeoisie. Tao Zhu's vicious methods not only thoroughly exposed his position, love, and hate, but also once again exposed the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie's so-called "freedom": only the prefect can set fires, but the common people cannot light lamps. We must do the opposite, not allowing poisonous weeds to spread freely!

	Tao Zhu also tightly grasped the news front, which can most influence the thoughts and political emotions of the masses, to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. He openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary newspaper policy, publicly putting forward the reactionary newspaper policy of "changing customs and guiding life," opening the door wide for the promotion of bourgeois goods. Under the guidance of Tao Zhu's black newspaper policy, the "Yangcheng Evening News" long-term did not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, did not publish news reflecting major class struggles at home and abroad, but vigorously promoted the decadent and corrupt lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, such as customs, folk tales, jokes, anecdotes, flowers, birds, insects, fish, calligraphy, chess, books, and paintings, and other low-level and vulgar things, filling the pages. This newspaper's supplement "Evening Party" became a gathering place for ghosts and monsters; "Flower Land" became a breeding ground for poisonous weeds; "Five Stories Down" took the opportunity to fully distort and vilify the socialist system. For more than a decade, many newspapers and periodicals in the Central South region, according to Tao Zhu's black policy and black guidelines, fired one poisonous arrow after another, shot one colorful sugar-coated bullet after another, turning the newspaper, this tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat, into a tool for the bourgeoisie to peacefully transform the socialist system, into a position for opposing the party and opposing socialism. After the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" in November 1965, newspapers and periodicals across the country successively reprinted it, but only the "Hunan Daily" under Tao Zhu's leadership refused to reprint; last April, when the conspiracy of the "Three Family Village" to oppose the party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought was exposed, the old "Beijing Daily" hurriedly published fake criticism and true cover-up black materials, but newspapers across the country did not reprint, only the "Guangzhou Daily" under Tao Zhu's protection exclusively reprinted. All this, from another aspect, further tells us: the conspirators' anti-party activities are everywhere. Tao Zhu attempted to use the newspaper, this tool that meets the people every day, to gradually stuff bourgeois ideas into the minds of the people, which is extremely vicious!

	Tao Zhu also extended his black hand to the educational sector, competing with the proletariat for the younger generation. He opposed Chairman Mao's policy of "serving proletarian politics with education and combining education with productive labor," promoting the revisionist educational line, openly opposing party leadership. He vigorously advocated reading first, scores first. He claimed that improving teaching quality is "making junior high school able to enter senior high school, senior high school able to enter college." He said that becoming an "expert," a "leader" is a great future, becoming a worker, mining coal is "wasting abilities," vigorously spreading the reactionary fallacy of "those who work with their brains rule others, those who work with their strength are ruled by others." He often put on a face of a "youth mentor," instilling the decadent bourgeois individualist worldview into the youth, selling China's Khrushchev's philosophy of "suffering a small loss for a big gain," saying, "If one looks at personal interests lightly, the country will value him, trust him. Such a person, the less he makes a fuss about personal interests and reputation, the more he will definitely have a good reputation and position." Tao Zhu's advocacy of this decadent bourgeois worldview makes the youth become short-sighted individualists, becoming the "tame tools" for Tao Zhu and his ilk to restore capitalism, becoming the successors of the bourgeoisie.

	Tao Zhu's series of crimes in the ideological sphere, concentrated in one point, like China's Khrushchev, is to fiercely oppose the occupation of the ideological sphere by Mao Zedong Thought. They know that once the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by hundreds of millions of people, their dream of restoring capitalism will not come true. Therefore, Tao Zhu has for many years not allowed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, not advocated the study of Chairman Mao's works. Even publishing Chairman Mao's quotations and poems in newspapers, holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on stage performances, he fiercely opposed. He waved the big stick of "vulgarization," slandering the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as "monks chanting scriptures every day," "what use is there." He fiercely attacked the brilliant "Three Articles," claiming, "'The Three Articles' are very simple, cadres have nothing to learn." Tao Zhu's desperate opposition to the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, in the end, is to prevent the proletariat from grasping powerful ideological weapons, making the proletariat completely disarmed ideologically in the face of the bourgeoisie's attacks.

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" deeply sketched Tao Zhu's political image: "Tao Zhu is completely a big rightist who escaped the net, a revisionist, a loyal executor and propagandist of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by China's Khrushchev, a counter-revolutionary two-faced person who sneaked in." "Tao Zhu is a Khrushchev-style ambitious person. He stubbornly insists on the capitalist political direction. He extremely hates socialism, he yearns for capitalism day and night. From politics, culture to life, his 'ideal' is to restore capitalism in China."

	For such a person, we must dig him out and throw him into the garbage heap of history!

专栏：

    陶铸是无产阶级专政的死敌	任志左
    陶铸这个反革命修正主义分子，十多年来，一贯紧跟党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨，竭力反对和破坏无产阶级专政，阴谋复辟资本主义。他鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，宣扬走资本主义道路。他反对伟大的毛泽东思想，大肆散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，为反革命复辟制造舆论。他是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的急先锋，是无产阶级专政的死敌。我们一定要和他斗争到底，把他斗倒批臭！		一
    社会主义社会里，还有没有阶级和阶级斗争？还要不要无产阶级专政？这是一个关系到是否把社会主义革命进行到底的关键问题，是关系到我国社会主义前途的大问题。
    早在一九四九年，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出，在全国胜利以后，无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，就是我们国内的基本矛盾；人民对于反动阶级和反动派，必须实行专政。一九五七年二月，在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作中，毛主席明确指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    当年四月，中国赫鲁晓夫就公开和毛主席大唱反调，胡说什么“现在国内敌人已经基本被消灭，地主阶级早已被消灭了，资产阶级也基本上被消灭，反革命也基本上被消灭了。我们说国内的主要阶级的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了。”陶铸紧紧跟上，学着中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调，在当年四月以后的多次讲话中，大谈特谈“阶级矛盾已经基本消灭了”，“阶级斗争基本结束了”。
    陶铸和他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫，这样竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，故意抹煞阶级和阶级斗争的客观现实，是妄想麻痹无产阶级的革命意志，以便他们这一伙反革命分子，大胆放手地推销资本主义和修正主义的货色，最后达到变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的罪恶目的。
    陶铸反对无产阶级专政是一贯的。每当阶级斗争尖锐激烈的时候，他都要跳出来，鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，站在阶级敌人的立场上，猖狂地向党进攻，恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政。
    一九五五年，我们揭露了胡风反革命集团的滔天罪行，在全国范围展开了轰轰烈烈的肃反运动的时候，陶铸公然为反革命分子喊冤叫屈，胡说什么：“目前中国大陆上潜伏的反革命分子的精神状态和他们的处境是可怜的，心情是痛苦的，不是很愉快的。”这真是反革命的感情和逻辑！要让反革命分子“心情愉快”，就必然要把劳动人民打入十八层地狱！陶铸站在反革命立场上，兔死狐悲，所以一再叫嚣，“对反革命分子我们首先讲宽大”。他就是要让反革命分子逍遥法外，等待时机，卷土重来，把无产阶级专政淹没在血泊中，实现反革命复辟。
    一九五七年，资产阶级右派已经开始向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，陶铸却出来大叫，“现在敌人打倒了，不要革命了，现在主要的任务是搞生产”，“阶级斗争已经基本消灭了”。他竭力鼓吹“政权的专政职权要削弱，从而转到领导生产，组织人民的经济生活和调整人民内部的矛盾方面去”；他还说什么“匈牙利事件肯定不会在我们中国发生，……大家可以好好睡觉”，“就是看到有‘打倒共产党’的口号，也要首先检查我们有没有不对的地方”。人们看见过各种各样的叛徒，但是象陶铸这样跪倒在敌人面前，说你们反革命是因为革命人民有错误，这样的叛卖行为还没有见识过。真是，如果把叛徒比作虱子，虱子也会感到屈辱的。
    在毛主席发出号召，全国人民已经向右派进行反击以后，陶铸还公然说：“对右派的斗争不能说是敌我之间的斗争”。当然，对于陶铸来说，右派分子以及一切反动派都是“内部矛盾”而不是“敌我”问题，因为陶铸自己就是一个资产阶级右派的大头目！所以他这样明目张胆地鼓励和掩护右派向党进攻。
    一九五九年，右倾机会主义分子彭德怀等猖狂地攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗时，陶铸又出来为他们打气，要他们“永不屈服于恶劣的环境”，要“经得起狂风暴雨的侵袭”。后来，当中国赫鲁晓夫为右倾机会主义刮起“翻案风”时，他又跳出来大叫“犯了错误，这三面红旗应该讲褪了色了”，恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政“使我们滋长官僚主义”；另一方面，又向地富反坏右频送秋波，说什么“反右派以后，两条道路问题基本解决了，今后党内外应互相信赖，加强团结，同舟共济”，“我们应该交交朋友”。他和阶级敌人交上了“朋友”，所以干脆宣告：“我们没有阶级矛盾，是主观与客观的矛盾”。陶铸的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，真是登峰造极，大大超出一般新老修正主义的水平。
    一九六二年，在党的八届十中全会上，毛主席作了社会主义社会中阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的报告，发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大战斗号召，完全揭穿了陶铸之流的阴谋。但是，在这之后，陶铸仍然公开和毛主席唱反调，胡说什么“剥削阶级，基本上被消灭了”，“凡是搞阶级斗争而影响和妨碍了生产的，都是错误的”，“资产阶级已不是完整的阶级了，是残余的阶级。”他并且对这“残余”的阶级，大肆吹捧，说中国的资产阶级是“搞革命”的，是“搞社会主义”的，是“世界上最漂亮的资产阶级”。他就是这样一个拜倒在资产阶级脚下的奴才！
    够了，从这些材料中，我们可以看清楚陶铸宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，为的是可以让一小撮反革命分子、右派分子、党内走资本主义道路当权派“心情愉快”地放肆地搞复辟活动，让陶铸之流和他们“同舟共济”，把无产阶级专政偷偷地改为资产阶级专政。		二
    新中国诞生之后，在全国人民面前摆着一个最根本最重要的问题：中国向何处去？毛主席指出：“事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志了新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命阶段的开始。毛主席及时地提出了过渡时期的总路线，要求我们在土地改革完成以后，立即进行社会主义改造，发展社会主义经济，建立无产阶级专政的新的经济基础，把革命推向前进。与此相反，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却说什么“中国不是资本主义多了，而是资本主义少了”，提出“巩固新民主主义秩序”，“确保私有财产”等口号，竭力抗拒生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。陶铸紧紧追随他的主子，在一九五三年，提出“要稳定新的生产关系，保护私有制的积极性，发展生产力”。为此，他大肆鼓吹“勤劳致富”，大力宣扬买卖土地、借贷、雇工、贸易等“四大自由”，并且荒唐地提出党员和干部要带头放债，不要怕“戴剥削的帽子”，拚命抵制社会主义改造，妄图使中国革命停顿下来，以便逐步实现他的资产阶级专政的美梦。
    在全国实现合作化以后，对于这个新建立起来的社会主义经济制度，是满腔热情地支持它、巩固它、发展它，还是攻击它、破坏它？这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线在经济战线上的又一次尖锐的斗争。
    毛主席及时指出：“新的社会制度还刚刚建立，还需要有一个巩固的时间。”毛主席号召全国人民继续坚持经济战线上的社会主义革命，坚决打击资本主义倾向。这时党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派又提倡资本主义经济和社会主义经济自由竞争，自由发展，动手大砍农业生产合作社。陶铸也跟随其主子，大挖社会主义的墙脚，一九五七年，趁着资产阶级右派向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的机会，煽起一股退社的黑风。他大肆宣传“农业生产合作社社员闹退社，我们完全让他们退，他们完全有自由，也是合法的。”妄图瓦解和破坏社会主义的集体经济。
    一九五八年，揭开了我们伟大祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设史上灿烂辉煌的一页。人民公社象一轮红日，从东方地平线上喷薄而出。总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，迎风招展，显示了在毛泽东思想指引下的我国劳动人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧，显示了革命的群众运动的巨大威力。
    陶铸这时候又迫不及待地跳了出来，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和彭德怀等右倾机会主义分子一起，配合国内外阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，恶毒地污蔑党中央“头脑发热了”，“搞得太快了”。一九六○年以后，他猖狂地对三面红旗发起了全面攻击。这个丧心病狂的反革命修正主义分子，闭眼不看三面红旗对全国人民的思想革命化的促进，不看在三面红旗指引下取得的伟大成就，不看三面红旗为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设创造的丰富经验，不看三面红旗在抗御三年自然灾害和在抵抗苏修对我们的破坏中所起到的伟大作用，胡说什么“搞总路线、大跃进、人民公社犯了严重错误”，恶毒地攻击和诬蔑我们的伟大的社会主义事业，说我们搞的是“贫困的痛苦的社会主义”。与此同时，他积极鼓吹要建设所谓“富裕的快乐的社会主义”。怎样达到他所要的“富裕的快乐的社会主义”呢？请看他所开的一张药方：一九六○年十一月十日，他在广东省委召开的电话会议上说：“我们不怕自发势力，现在不是自发太多，而是统得太死。”这就是要让资本主义经济大肆泛滥。
    同年十二月，在广东省三级干部会议上又说：“即使有点资本主义自发势力活动，最多也是出几个‘小贩资本家’，这有什么可怕！”这就是要培养新的资产阶级分子。
    就在这种思想指导下，他大力推行“包产到户”，积极“恢复农村集市”，鼓励“私人开荒不受限制”，甚至公然提出“单干可以”的号召。
    很清楚，陶铸鼓吹的这个药方，是彻头彻尾的复辟资本主义的药方！
    在社会主义经济蓬勃发展的时候，是无产阶级的政治挂帅，还是鼓吹物质刺激，使社会主义经济蜕化为资本主义经济？这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线在经济战线上斗争的关键问题。
    和一切新老修正主义分子一样，陶铸一贯反对突出政治。早在土改后不久，他就曾提出过“生产压倒一切”，“全力转向生产”的口号。当社会主义集体经济日益发展，日益巩固的时候，他同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一样，为了使社会主义经济蜕化变质，便更加起劲地鼓吹起“生产第一”和物质刺激来了。一九六一年他公开宣称：“过去我们搞东西靠政治的办法，……那样不仅搞不到，而且破坏生产，越搞越少，现在要采取经济的办法。”他污蔑政治工作是“说空话”，“放大炮”，“不能当饭吃”。宣传什么“生产观点就是我们的群众观点的集中表现，有无生产观点，就是有无群众观点的试金石。”和党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派一样，他也提倡什么“黑猫、白猫能捉老鼠就是好猫”，“增产就是马列主义，减产就是主观主义”。在陶铸亲自提出的所谓建设社会主义新农村的“八条”中，竟没有一条讲的是政治。甚至连伟大的社会主义教育运动，他也把“清政治”放在了极其次要的地位。陶铸反对突出无产阶级政治，必然突出资产阶级政治，使“物质刺激”，“利润刺激”，“奖金刺激”这一套泛滥成灾，从而导致资本主义的复辟。
    事实上，陶铸从“生产第一”的观点出发，把苏修的一套一古脑儿搬过来了。他鼓励各级党委全力抓生产，要变成“养猪党委”、“粮食党委”、“绿化党委”。如果按照陶铸这一套去办，我们的工厂、农村就要变成繁殖修正主义的摇篮、复辟资本主义的温床，我们的党就要变成资产阶级、修正主义的党；社会主义的所有制就要变质，无产阶级专政的经济基础就会被寄生虫、吸血鬼、投机商等这些蛀虫所蛀空。陶铸的险毒用心在此！		三
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”陶铸这个老谋深算的资产阶级代理人，是很懂得“软刀子杀人”的厉害的。他大力抓文学、艺术、新闻、教育等，就是企图利用这些阵地，散布封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒素，抗拒伟大的毛泽东思想，以便为复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    首先，他抵制毛主席的革命路线，歪曲毛主席的
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策。毛主席一再教导我们：要使文化艺术很好地成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器。毛主席提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，就是无产阶级的坚定的阶级政策，它是为巩固无产阶级专政，为在意识形态领域里开展灭资兴无的斗争服务的。但是陶铸却采取偷天换日的手法，抽掉它的阶级内容，塞进资产阶级自由化的黑货，以适应资产阶级的需要。他一再鼓吹：“什么主义，什么派别，什么论调，都应该允许它存在，让它‘齐放’与‘争鸣’”，不能“只准你‘放’，不准我
  ‘放’，只准你‘鸣’，不准我‘鸣’”。千方百计地为封建主义、资本主义和修正主义争地位，争发言权，千方百计地取消无产阶级对于这些思想敌人的斗争。在他的鼓吹和支持下，广东和中南地区文艺界乌云翻滚，群魔乱舞。在戏剧舞台上，占主要地位的不是工农兵，不是世界历史的创造者人民群众，而是帝王将相、才子佳人、地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神。在文学艺术作品方面，《三家巷》、《苦斗》、《艺海拾贝》、《花城》、《唐诗小札》、《韶山的节日》等毒草纷纷破土而出，流毒全国。在电影界，《逆风千里》、《齐王求将》、《刘明珠》、《南海潮》等反动影片充斥银幕，毒害观众。陶铸还秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，通过鼓吹“海瑞精神”，宣扬“包公替民伸冤”，替右倾机会主义分子叫好，替被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀翻案，把矛头直接指向党中央和毛主席。陶铸还赤膊上阵，亲自出马，向党射出了《理想，情操，精神生活》、《思想·感情·文采》两支大毒箭。当陶铸放手叫牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼的恶毒阴谋遭到广大无产阶级革命派的抵制和批判的时候，他立刻露出了一副凶煞相，胡说“我们有些同志一脸的‘秋风萧瑟’”，
  “秋风一来，树叶脱尽，还有什么百花齐放呢？”陶铸的所谓“放”和“鸣”，实际是只许牛鬼蛇神为复辟资本主义狂吠乱叫，而不许无产阶级对地主资产阶级进行批判和反击。陶铸这种恶毒的手段，不仅彻底暴露他究竟是站在什么立场上，爱谁恨谁，而且也再一次暴露了资产阶级所谓的“自由”的虚伪性：只许州官放火，不准百姓点灯。我们必须反其道而行之，不许毒草自由泛滥！
    陶铸还紧紧抓住最能影响群众思想和政治情绪的新闻阵地，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。他公然反对毛主席的无产阶级的革命的办报方针，公开抛出“移风易俗，指导生活”的反动的办报纲领，为宣扬资产阶级的货色，大开方便之门。在陶铸这条办报黑纲领指导下的《羊城晚报》，长期以来不宣传毛泽东思想，不刊登反映国内外重大阶级斗争的新闻，而是大肆宣扬吟风弄月、吃喝玩乐等资产阶级腐朽糜烂的生活情调，什么风俗人情、笑话掌故、花鸟虫鱼、琴棋书画等低级而庸俗的东西，充塞版面。这张报纸的副刊《晚会》成了牛鬼蛇神的大集会；《花地》成了毒花莠草的丛生地；《五层楼下》借题发挥，极尽丑化社会主义制度之能事。十几年来，中南地区许多报纸刊物，根据陶铸规定的黑方针、黑纲领，射出一支支的毒箭，打出一颗颗五颜六色的糖衣炮弹，把报纸这个无产阶级专政的工具变成了资产阶级对社会主义制度实行和平演变的工具，变成了反党反社会主义的阵地。一九六五年十一月，姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文发表后，全国报刊先后都加以转载，唯独陶铸领导下的《湖南日报》拒不转载；去年四月，当“三家村”反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的阴谋败露，旧《北京日报》匆忙发表了假批判、真包庇的黑材料之后，全国报纸都不加转载，唯独在陶铸卵翼下的《广州日报》独家转载。这一切，又从另一个方面向我们进一步说明：阴谋家的反党活动是无孔不入的。陶铸妄图利用报纸这一天天同群众见面的工具，一点一点地把资产阶级思想塞到人民群众的脑子中去，真是恶毒极了！
    陶铸还把他的黑手伸向了教育界，同无产阶级争夺青年一代。他反对毛主席的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，推行修正主义的教育路线，吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的专家治校的黑思想，明目张胆地反对党的领导。他大肆提倡读书第一，分数第一。胡说什么提高教学质量就是“使初中能够升高中，高中能够升大学”。说什么当“专家”，当“领导者”才是远大前途，当工人、挖煤炭就是“浪费能力”，大肆传播“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的封建主义反动谬论。他还经常摆出一副“青年导师”的面孔，向青年灌输腐朽的资产阶级个人主义人生观，推销中国赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏占大便宜”的市侩哲学，说什么“把个人利益看得很轻，国家便会重视他，信任他。这样的人，愈不闹个人利益与名誉地位，那他就一定会有很好的荣誉和地位。”陶铸宣扬这一套腐朽的资产阶级人生观，使青年变成鼠目寸光的个人主义者，成为陶铸之流复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”，成为资产阶级的接班人。
    陶铸在意识形态领域中干的这一系列罪行，集中到一点，同中国赫鲁晓夫一样，就是疯狂地反对毛泽东思想占领意识形态领域。他们知道，光焰无际的毛泽东思想一经亿万群众所掌握，他们复辟资本主义的美梦就做不成了。所以陶铸多年来根本不让宣传毛泽东思想，不提倡学习毛主席著作。甚至连报纸上刊登毛主席语录和毛主席诗词，在舞台表演中手拿《毛主席语录》，他都疯狂地反对。他挥舞“庸俗化”的大棒，污蔑广大工农兵群众学习毛主席著作是“和尚天天念经”，“有啥用”。他疯狂地攻击光芒万丈的“老三篇”，胡说“‘老三篇’很简单，干部没有什么可学”。陶铸拚命地反对宣传毛泽东思想，归根到底，就是不让无产阶级掌握强大的思想武器，使无产阶级在资产阶级的进攻面前完全解除思想武装。
    姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》的文章，深刻地勾画了陶铸的政治面目：“陶铸完全是一个漏网的大右派，是一个修正主义者，是以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线忠实的执行者和宣传者，是一个混进来的反革命两面派”。“陶铸是一个赫鲁晓夫式的野心家。他顽固地坚持资本主义的政治方向。他极端仇恨社会主义，他日夜向往着资本主义。从政治上、文化上到生活上，他的‘理想’都是在中国搞资本主义复辟。”
    对于这样的人，只有把他挖出来，扔进历史的垃圾堆！
