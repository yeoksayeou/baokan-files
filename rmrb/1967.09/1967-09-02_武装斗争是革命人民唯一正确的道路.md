On this glorious occasion of celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we are filled with immense excitement as we enthusiastically cheer for the brilliant victories achieved by our Vietnamese brothers in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation!

The heroic Vietnamese people have raised the banner of anti-imperialism, firmly grasped their rifles, and risen up to fight. They have beaten back the American aggressors who invaded the south and the American air pirates who bombed the north, leaving them in disarray and suffering a crushing defeat. This people's war is fought brilliantly and magnificently! It greatly boosts the morale of revolutionary people and thoroughly crushes the arrogance of American imperialism. The heroic Vietnamese people have set a shining example for all oppressed peoples and nations.

However, driven by its aggressive nature, American imperialism is not willing to perish. It continues to play the "war" and "peace" tricks. On one hand, it ruthlessly bombs from south to north, trying to force surrender through war; on the other hand, it waves the "peace" flag, attempting to deceive the Vietnamese people into accepting its "peace talks" trap and surrendering. At this moment when the Americans are suffering one defeat after another, the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique jumps out to act as the faithful henchman of American imperialism, running around and shouting on behalf of the Americans. They scream at the top of their lungs, advocating that American imperialism is "wise," saying that as long as they accept American imperialism's "peace talks" and sign some "treaty," the Vietnamese people can end the "disaster" of war! They want the Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and shake hands with the enemy who is killing them, which in reality means giving up the victory fruits won through 22 years of blood and sacrifice, and willingly submitting to the oppression and exploitation of American imperialism and its lackeys. Anyone with a bit of political sense can see clearly that the Soviet revisionist clique's advocacy of American "wisdom" and Vietnam-American "peace talks" is nothing but opium to numb the revolutionary will of the people, a chain to bind the hands and feet of the revolutionary people. Facts speak louder than words. American imperialism, despite being thousands of miles away, has sent over 460,000 troops to invade South Vietnam, using a large number of tactical air forces to carry out inhuman bombing. Is this the "wisdom" advocated by the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique? American imperialism has used all modern weapons and chemical poisons, except nuclear weapons, in South Vietnam to ruthlessly massacre the Vietnamese people. Is this the "peaceful" intention advocated by the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique?

Four years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Statement Opposing the Aggression and Massacre of the People of South Vietnam by the American-Bao Dai Clique": "The oppressed peoples and nations cannot rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." This is an absolute truth of Marxism-Leninism, the only path for all oppressed peoples and nations to defeat imperialism and its lackeys and strive for liberation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," "Their nature cannot be changed, imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their annihilation." A dog's nature cannot be changed, nor can a tiger's nature of eating people. Imperialism relies on aggression for its livelihood, and on war for its livelihood. The aggressive nature of American imperialism will not change. Therefore, our response to the enemy's aggression should be, and can only be: to fight fiercely! To fight continuously! To decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them!

Can revolutionary people thoroughly defeat the armed-to-the-teeth, ferocious, and evil imperialism? The answer is: Yes! Definitely yes! The revolution of the Chinese people has proven this, and the revolution of the Vietnamese people has proven this again. Our own personal experiences have also proven this. Among us, Comrade Han Chunlin, in the Iron Triangle Battle of the Korean War, with five comrades, blocked an enemy battalion, fought for three days and nights, repelled dozens of enemy assaults supported by aircraft and artillery, and annihilated more than 200 enemies. Our weapons were far inferior to the enemy's, but we were able to achieve such a great victory by relying on what? It was relying on people's awareness, bravery, and spirit of sacrifice. On the contrary, if we are not daring to struggle and persist in struggle, if we follow the Soviet revisionist clique's advocacy and put our hopes on the "wisdom" of imperialism and a piece of paper signed with imperialism, then the liberation of the oppressed and invaded peoples would only be "a basket of water, a futile effort."

The heroic Vietnamese people are creatively applying the great strategic thought of people's war, bravely pursuing and attacking the American aggressors. We, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end. We are not afraid of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique shouting at the top of their lungs, accusing us of being warlike. We are indeed fighting for revolution. War is initiated by imperialism. It imposes war on us, and we have no choice but to fight back. We must use revolutionary war to annihilate counter-revolutionary war. Not supporting a just revolutionary war is the greatest betrayal of the revolution.

We are convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people, as long as they persist in armed struggle, will definitely, as predicted by the great leader of the Chinese and world peoples, Chairman Mao, four years ago: "The people of South Vietnam will definitely achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

Vietnam will win! America will lose!

　　武装斗争是革命人民唯一正确的道路
　　北京部队某师　韩春林　张振东　张登顺　姜正福　郑风仪
    在这庆祝越南民主共和国成立二十二周年的光辉时刻，我们怀着无比激动的心情，为兄弟的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利热烈欢呼！
    英雄的越南人民高举反帝大旗，紧握枪杆子，奋起斗争，把闯进南方的美国强盗和侵入北方天空的美国飞贼打得丢盔弃甲，一败涂地。这场人民战争打得好，打得漂亮！大长革命人民的志气，大灭美帝国主义的威风。英雄的越南人民为一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了光辉的榜样。
    但是，美帝国主义出于侵略本性，并不甘心灭亡，仍然三番五次地加紧玩弄战、“和”反革命两手。一方面，它灭绝人性地从南到北，狂轰滥炸，以战压降；一方面，又大摇“和平”破旗，企图诱使越南人民接受它的“和谈”骗局，俯首投降。正在美帝节节惨败的时刻，苏修叛徒集团却充当美帝国主义的忠实帮凶，跳将出来，为美帝奔走呼号，甘效犬马之劳。他们声嘶力竭地鼓吹什么美帝国主义是“明智”的，说什么只要接受美帝国主义的“和谈”，签订个什么“条约”，越南人民就可以结束战争的“灾难”！他们要越南人民放下武器，与屠杀自己的敌人握手谈“和”，实际上就是要越南人民放弃二十二年流血牺牲换来的胜利果实，甘受美帝国主义及其走狗的压榨和剥削。稍有政治头脑的人一看就清楚，苏修集团鼓吹美帝“明智”和美越“和谈”，只不过是贩卖麻醉人民革命意志的鸦片烟，是抛出一条束缚人民革命手足的锁链。事实胜于雄辩，美帝国主义远隔重洋，调兵遣将，入侵南越的美军增加到四十六万多，动用大量战术空军力量，进行惨无人道的狂轰滥炸，难道这就是苏修叛徒集团鼓吹的“明智”吗？美帝在南越使用了除核武器以外的一切现代化武器和化学毒药，灭绝人性地残杀越南人民。难道这就是苏修叛徒集团鼓吹的“和平”诚意吗？
    毛主席四年前在《反对美国—吴庭艳集团侵略和屠杀越南南方人民的声明》中指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”这是一条千真万确的马克思列宁主义真理，是一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族打败帝国主义及其走狗、争取解放的唯一道路。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，“它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”狗性难改，老虎吃人的本性难移。帝国主义就是靠侵略吃饭，靠战争吃饭。美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。因此，我们对敌人侵略的回答就应该是，也只能是：狠狠打！连续打！坚决、彻底、干净、全部消灭之！
    革命人民能不能彻底打败武装到牙齿的穷凶极恶的帝国主义呢？回答是：能！一定能！中国人民的革命证明了这点，越南人民的革命又证明了这点。我们自己的切身经历，同样证明了这点。我们中的韩春林同志，在朝鲜战场的铁原阻击战中，和五位战友阻击了一个营的敌人，三天三夜，击退了敌人有飞机大炮配合的数十次冲锋，消灭了二百多名敌人。我们的武器远远不如敌人，却能以少胜多，取得了如此巨大的胜利，靠的是什么？靠的就是人的觉悟、勇敢和牺牲精神。与此相反，如果不是敢于斗争、坚持斗争，如果象苏修集团鼓吹的那样，把希望寄托在帝国主义的“明智”和与帝国主义签订的一纸条约上，那末，被压迫和被侵略的人民的解放，就只能是“竹箩筐打水，一场空”。
    英雄的越南人民正在创造性地运用人民战争的伟大战略思想，英勇地穷追猛打美国侵略者。我们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决支持越南人民打到底。我们决不怕美帝国主义和苏修集团扯破喉咙诬蔑我们“好战”。我们就是好革命之战。战争，是帝国主义发动的。它把战争强加在我们头上，不打是不行的。我们就是要用革命战争消灭反革命战争。对正义的革命战争不支持，就是对革命的最大背叛。
    我们确信，英雄的越南人民，只要坚持武装斗争，就一定会象中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席四年前预言的那样：“越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献。”
    越南必胜！美帝必败！
