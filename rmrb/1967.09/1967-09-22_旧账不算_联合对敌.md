In the days leading up to the glorious and brilliant National Day, the revolutionary masses of the capital's automobile company have united.

After seizing power, we revolutionary masses of the proletariat have not sufficiently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Our minds are filled with selfish thoughts, leading to the formation of two major factions. During the summer harvest, one faction sent food, but the other faction would rather go hungry than eat it. Even the study sessions organized by the military control committee saw the two factions unable to sit together.

Just as the petty-bourgeois factionalism in our minds was hindering our realization of revolutionary unity, Chairman Mao, in his infinite wisdom, issued new instructions: Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions. This instruction is like a lighthouse in the sea, illuminating our path forward. Various revolutionary mass organizations in our company engaged in extensive study and discussion, deeply understanding and internalizing this instruction. During the discussions, everyone expressed that there are no fundamental conflicts of interest between us, no reason to split into two factions, and certainly no reason not to unite. Great unity is Chairman Mao's grand strategic deployment, and we must follow it closely. We must execute Chairman Mao's instructions whether we understand them or not, and understand them through execution. Chairman Mao told us to rebel against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and we rebelled; he told us to seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and we seized it; now he tells us to unite, and we must resolutely carry it out to move from one victory to another. After the discussions, everyone agreed to settle old scores, not to bring up old matters, and not to pursue responsibilities. We must unite to fight the enemy together. Once our thoughts were unified, everyone expressed a willingness to be a model of great unity. On September 19, both sides issued a call for great unity. Upon hearing this good news, the revolutionary masses were overjoyed and spread the word. The entire company was in an uproar! Some comrades, tears streaming down their faces, said: We haven't spoken for over eight months. It was the biggest capitalist-roader in the party who divided us into two factions, weakening our fighting spirit. We fell for his trick. This account must be settled with the Chinese Khrushchev.

The great revolutionary unity is not the end of the struggle but the beginning of a better struggle. In the future, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, focus our efforts on the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit, and vow to thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and annihilate the Chinese Khrushchev!

　　旧账不算  联合对敌
　　首都汽车公司革命联合委员会
    在迎接光辉灿烂的伟大国庆的日子里，我们首都汽车公司的无产阶级革命派联合起来了。
    我们无产阶级革命派夺权以后，由于学习毛主席著作不够，用得不好，脑子里有“私”字，一直形成两大派，学习和工作都弄不到一块儿。如今年夏收期间，这一派送去的饭，另一派宁愿饿着肚子都不吃。军管会同志组织的毛主席著作学习会，两派也坐不到一起。
    正当我们脑子里小资产阶级派性阻碍着我们实现革命大联合的关键时刻，毛主席他老人家又给我们发出了最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。这个指示象大海里的灯塔一样，照亮了我们前进的航程。我们公司各个革命群众组织展开了大学习，大讨论，认真体会，深刻理解。在讨论过程中，大家纷纷表示，我们之间没有根本的利害冲突，没有理由分成两大派组织，更没有理由不联合起来。大联合是毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们应当紧跟再紧跟。毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行的过程中去理解。毛主席叫我们造走资本主义道路当权派的反，我们造了；叫我们夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，我们也夺了；现在又叫我们大联合，我们更应当坚决照办，才能从胜利走向新的胜利。经过讨论，大家认为旧账不要算了，旧事不要提了，责任不必追了，要团结起来共同对敌。大家的思想统一起来后，都表示要作大联合的模范。九月十九日，双方发出了大联合倡议。当广大革命群众听到这大好喜讯之后，无不欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。整个公司沸腾起来了！有的同志激动得热泪盈眶地说：我们八个多月不说话了，这是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派把我们分成了两派，削弱了我们的斗争意志，我们上了他的当。这笔账，一定要记在中国赫鲁晓夫头上。
    革命的大联合决不是战斗的终结，而是为了更好的战斗。我们今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，集中力量搞好本单位的斗批改，誓把中国的赫鲁晓夫批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
