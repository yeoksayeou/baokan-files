	Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and tigers.
	Recently, victory reports from North and South Vietnam have been frequent. In the South, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, undaunted by fatigue, have been fighting continuously, annihilating and severely damaging seven companies and a battalion command post of the U.S. troops in the Khe Sanh area. In the North, the Vietnamese people have given the U.S. bandits a severe beating. The military and civilian population of Vinh Linh District shot down two U.S. B-52 strategic bombers in one day, adding a glorious page to the great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people.

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on September 19, solemnly declaring that the Vietnamese people have an iron will and are determined to give the U.S. aggressors the punishment they deserve.

	Brave Vietnamese brothers, you have fought well! We cheer for your victories and are proud of your victories.

	U.S. imperialism has already fallen into the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war. However, it is still struggling desperately. Every time its aggressive plots are thwarted by the Vietnamese people and fail, it escalates the war, trying to reverse the situation. But the result is only more severe defeats. Every time the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, it marks the escalation of their failure in the Vietnam War. Now, the U.S. aggressors have brought out B-52 strategic bombers to bomb North Vietnam indiscriminately and are shouting about "expanding bombing targets." It looks fierce, but in fact, it is at its wits' end, indicating that its capital for gambling in Vietnam is running out.

	In the Vietnam War, hasn't U.S. imperialism always boasted about its "air superiority"? It has hyped up its B-52 strategic bombers as if they were something extraordinary. However, in South Vietnam, it cannot save the lives of U.S. aggressors; in North Vietnam, it still ends up crashing. The myth of U.S. imperialism's "air superiority" has long been shattered by the heroic Vietnamese people.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things."

	The modern weapons in the hands of U.S. imperialism can only intimidate those who are cowardly and afraid of death. However, the Vietnamese people, who do not want to be slaves and are fighting for national liberation, are towering heroes. They dare to struggle and dare to win. In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, the "air superiority" and "weapon superiority" of U.S. imperialism are nothing but a pile of dung.

	The Vietnamese people are advancing in victory, and they will not rest until they have thoroughly driven out the U.S. aggressors. The great Vietnamese people will definitely overcome all obstacles, cross all difficulties, and achieve the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war.

　　欢呼越南兄弟打得好！

    独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。
    最近，越南南北捷报频传。在南方，南越解放武装力量不怕疲劳，连续作战，在桂山地区歼灭和重创美军七个连和一个营指挥部。在北方，越南人民痛揍美国飞贼，永灵区军民在一天内击落了两架美国B—52型战略轰炸机，为越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争增添了一页光辉的战绩。
    越南民主共和国外交部九月十九日发表声明，严正宣告：越南人民有着钢铁般的决心，坚决给予美国侵略者以应得的惩罚。
    英勇的越南兄弟，你们打得好！我们为你们的胜利而欢呼，为你们的胜利而骄傲。
    美帝国主义已经陷于越南人民战争的汪洋大海之中。可是，它还在进行绝望的挣扎。每当它的侵略阴谋遭到越南人民的沉重打击而失败之后，它就来一次战争
  “升级”，企图挽回败局。但是，结果只能遭到更惨重的失败。美帝国主义的每一次战争“升级”，标志着它侵越战争失败的“升级”。现在，美国侵略强盗搬出B—52型战略轰炸机到越南北方狂轰滥炸，并狂叫什么要
  “扩大轰炸目标”。看起来气势汹汹，其实是黔驴技穷，表明它在越南进行绝望赌博的本钱已经不多了。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中，不是一直吹嘘它的“空中优势”吗？把它的B—52型战略轰炸机说得神乎其神，好象了不起。但是，它在越南南方，救不了美国侵略者的命；在越南北方，照样变成倒栽葱。美帝国主义所谓的“空中优势”的神话，早就被英雄的越南人民打得粉碎。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”
    美帝国主义手里的现代化武器，只能吓唬一些贪生怕死的胆小鬼。但是，不愿做奴隶的、为祖国解放而战的越南人民是顶天立地的英雄。他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利。在英雄的越南人民面前，美帝国主义的那些“空中优势”、“武器优势”只不过是一堆粪土。
    越南人民正在乘胜前进，不把美国侵略强盗彻底赶走，他们誓不罢休。伟大的越南人民，一定能够排除一切障碍，跨过一切艰险，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
