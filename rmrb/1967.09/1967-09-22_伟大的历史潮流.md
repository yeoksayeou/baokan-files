The latest instructions from Chairman Mao have spread throughout the country, from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall. The tide of great revolutionary unity is surging forward!

The working class of Beijing, Shanghai, and all parts of the country, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and the Red Guards have all reported their new victories in revolutionary unity to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The drums of celebration echo across the land, and countless reports of joy light up the sky.

Revolutionary unity is an irresistible great historical tide.

This tide is a heavier blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

This tide is a fierce assault on petty-bourgeois factionalism.

This tide will mobilize hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to form a mighty army, ensuring that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat advances swiftly along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

Every revolutionary fighter should rejoice at the arrival of this tide and contribute their strength to its development.

Revolutionary unity is an inevitable trend in the development of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the common wish of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary masses across the country. We must promote revolutionary unity through the revolutionary great criticism. Only by uniting can we carry out the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units. Any thoughts that do not meet the requirements of revolutionary unity and the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao must be quickly corrected and overcome.

On the path of revolutionary unity, some of our comrades are like a woman with bound feet, wobbling along, always complaining to others: "You're walking too fast, too fast." They hold onto their old grudges like a heavy bundle, cling to their petty interests like a mountain, and not only can't move forward themselves but also want to drag others down. However, the historical tide always develops according to its own laws. Those who insist on their own superiority, think that the conditions for revolutionary unity are not ripe, and only advocate "slowly, slowly" without creating conditions, will fall far behind the historical tide if they do not change their course.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have given us a key to achieving revolutionary unity. Those who are still infatuated with their petty interests should break free from the limitations of "self" and liberate themselves from the petty-bourgeois factionalism. Only in this way can we see the overall interests, the interests of the proletariat, and the interests of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Our ideological horizon will then be broadened.

Let us, in the high tide of revolutionary great criticism, vigorously promote and achieve revolutionary unity!

The working class across the country should unite swiftly, the Red Guards should unite swiftly, and the revolutionary factions of all fronts should unite swiftly. In the historical tide of revolutionary unity, let us build new merits and welcome new victories!

　　伟大的历史潮流
    毛主席的最新指示，传遍了大江南北，长城内外。革命大联合的洪流奔腾起来了！
    北京、上海和全国各地的工人阶级，无产阶级革命派，红卫兵小将，纷纷用革命大联合的新胜利，向我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央报喜。欢庆的锣鼓响彻着大地，数不清的喜报映红了天空。
    革命的大联合，是一股不可抗拒的伟大的历史潮流。
    这股潮流，是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的更加沉重的打击。
    这股潮流，是对小资产阶级派性的最猛烈的冲击。
    这股潮流，将调动亿万革命群众，组成浩浩荡荡的大军，保证无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线迅跑。
    每一个革命战士，都应当为这个潮流的到来而欢呼，为这个潮流的发展而贡献出自己的力量。
    革命的大联合，是无产阶级文化大革命发展的必然趋势，是全国工农兵和广大革命群众的共同心愿。我们要在革命的大批判中促进革命的大联合。只有联合起来，才能搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改。一切不符合革命大联合要求的，不符合毛主席伟大战略部署要求的错误思想，必须迅速纠正，及时克服。
    在革命大联合的道路上，我们的某些同志却象一个小脚女人，东摇西摆地在那里走路，老是埋怨旁人说：走快了，走快了。他们抱着旧账的大包袱不放，抱着小山头的大包袱不放，自己走不动路，还想把别人拖着。但是，历史的潮流总是按着自己的规律向前发展，那种唯我独尊、认为革命大联合的条件不成熟，只是主张“慢慢来”而不去创造条件的人，如果不改弦易辙，就会远远落在历史潮流的后头。
    毛主席教导我们：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
    毛主席的这个最新指示，给了我们实现革命大联合一把开窍的钥匙。那些还在迷恋小山头的人们，应当打破“私”字的局限，从小资产阶级派性的小天地里解放出来，只有这样，我们才能看到全局的利益，无产阶级的利益，无产阶级文化大革命的利益，我们的思想境界才会豁然开朗。
    让我们在革命大批判的高潮中，大力促进和实现革命的大联合！
    全国的工人阶级迅速地联合起来，红卫兵小将迅速地联合起来，条条战线的无产阶级革命派迅速地联合起来，在革命大联合的历史潮流中，建立新的功勋，迎接新的胜利！
