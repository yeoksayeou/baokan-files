Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Shanghai has launched a new wave of supporting the army and loving the people. The military and civilians are determined to unite more closely, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, SHANGHAI, SEPTEMBER 1 - In China's largest industrial city, Shanghai, a magnificent and surging new wave of supporting the army and loving the people has been launched. Today, Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, broad revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai held a grand rally. They enthusiastically responded to and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to further develop the movement of supporting the army and loving the people. They decided, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, to unite the military and civilians more closely, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

	The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee today made a decision to launch a larger-scale campaign to support the army and love the people. It called on all proletarian revolutionary factions, all Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, all revolutionary masses and patriotic people in the city, as well as all officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, to raise high the great banner of supporting the army and loving the people, to unite forever, fight together, and win together.

	Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Wang Shaoyong, Ma Shui, Gao Zhrong, Ji Yingwu, and responsible comrades of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, Li Shiyin, Liu Wenxue, Rao Shoukun, Wang Weiguo, as well as leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the city, attended today's meeting.

	Wang Shaoyong, a member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, said in his speech: The call issued by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to launch the movement of supporting the army and loving the people is another great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, a very important and latest directive. The proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary Red Guards, broad revolutionary masses, and all officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai in our city will enthusiastically respond to and resolutely implement this great call, resolutely carry out the decision of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee to launch the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, and immediately launch a larger-scale new wave of supporting the army and loving the people.

	He said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a great pillar for safeguarding the national defense security of our socialist motherland, and the most reliable guarantee for safeguarding our country's proletarian cultural revolution. Without the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, there would be no dictatorship of the proletariat, and there would be no proletarian cultural revolution. The proletarian revolutionary factions and all revolutionary masses must resolutely believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army. No matter what storms and rains may come, we must never waver in our firm trust in the People's Liberation Army.

	He called on all officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, all revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary people to unite more closely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to heighten their revolutionary vigilance a thousandfold, to guard against class enemies stirring up trouble and taking advantage of the chaos. For the destructive activities of active counter-revolutionaries, we must implement the dictatorship of the proletariat and suppress them severely.

	Li Shiyin, a representative of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, said in his speech, We, the officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, are filled with boundless enthusiasm as we most enthusiastically support and respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and most resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's great call. We will definitely raise high the banner of loving the people, carry forward the tradition of loving the people, and take immediate action to launch a more extensive, deeper, and larger-scale movement of loving the people.

	He said, We love the people, and the most fundamental thing is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We love the people, and we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," firmly support the leftists, cherish the leftists, and protect the leftists, unite with the leftists, fight with the leftists, and win with the leftists. We love the people, and we must also follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes," humbly regard the revolutionary leftists as our teachers, diligently and conscientiously be the students of the masses, and learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions, learn from the revolutionary youngsters of the Red Guards, and learn from the broad revolutionary masses. We love the people, and we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching to correctly treat ourselves, "persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests." We love the people, and we must definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, safeguard national defense, safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat, and safeguard the proletarian cultural revolution. We must resolutely safeguard the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, obey the correct leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and modelly carry out the various directives and resolutions of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Following Chairman Mao's teaching and responding to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, we will achieve new merits for the people in the proletarian cultural revolution.

	Representatives of Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, as well as representatives of the Red Guards youngsters, spoke one after another at the meeting. They said, Since the proletarian cultural revolution, we have felt the warm care, full support, and assistance of the People's Liberation Army everywhere. It is the People's Liberation Army that has set us an active example of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, it is the People's Liberation Army that has brought us good experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in struggle, it is the People's Liberation Army that has brought us the good style of revolutionization and militarization, and it is the People's Liberation Army that has brought us the hard-boned spirit of proletarian revolutionary heroism. To push the proletarian cultural revolution forward, we will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," learn from and implement the decision of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee to launch the movement of supporting the army and loving the people. We will unswervingly do a good job of supporting the army and strive to be the vanguard and model of supporting the army.

	The meeting, amidst warm applause, read out the draft of the covenant for supporting the army by Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and people from all walks of life, and the draft of the covenant for loving the government and the people by the PLA stationed in Shanghai. In the evening, dozens of proletarian revolutionary factions in the city, broad revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of the PLA stationed in Shanghai held a grand "supporting the army and loving the people" joint performance.
