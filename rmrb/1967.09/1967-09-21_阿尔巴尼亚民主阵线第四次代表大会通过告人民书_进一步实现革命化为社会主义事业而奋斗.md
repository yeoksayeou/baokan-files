The Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front adopted a message to the Albanian people on September 16.

The message to the people said, today, the socialist revolution is advancing victoriously in all aspects along the path set by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania. The people's consciousness, worldview, life, and work are further revolutionized. Deep political, ideological, and economic changes are taking place in the life of the state and among the entire people.

The message to the people said, the People's Republic of China, which has a fraternal, sincere, and internationalist friendship with our people, is successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and has become an indestructible bastion of world revolution and socialism.

The message to the people said, the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has dealt a fatal blow to the American imperialists. The struggle of the Arab people, the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing and expanding, striking heavy blows at the imperialist forces and exposing the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists. The Albanian people fully support the struggle of all the peoples of the world against exploitation and oppression, for freedom, independence, and socialism, and believe that the flames of the great liberation struggle will reduce the imperialists and revisionists to ashes.

The message to the people said, the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front once again fully reflected the fighting unity of our people and their determination to strengthen this unity.

The message to the people said, the Democratic Front, in its daily activities, inherits and embodies the patriotic revolutionary traditions of our people from generation to generation. The younger generation must always maintain and develop the vitality of loving freedom and revolutionary spirit.

The message to the people pointed out, the task of the Democratic Front is to always maintain the high revolutionary vigilance of our people and the concept of readiness to defend the socialist homeland. Never forget that our country is advancing along the path of revolution and socialism under the conditions of being surrounded and blockaded by imperialists and revisionists. Our people and the enemies of socialism—imperialists, Khrushchev and Tito revisionists, Greek monarchist fascists, and reactionaries of various countries—are constantly plotting against our people and our country.

For this reason, the Democratic Front calls on workers, peasants, intellectuals, male and female youth, and all members of the Front to consciously carry out the sacred task of defending the motherland, actively participate in physical training and military training, and be ready to respond to the Party's call to hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other.

The message to the people appeals to the members of the Democratic Front to actively participate in all activities of the state organs, widely implement socialist democracy, express their opinions on every matter, supervise the state organs and the people working in them, and wage an uncompromising struggle against any manifestation of bureaucracy, and always maintain high vigilance against any behavior and manifestations that weaken proletarian dictatorship and harm the thoroughly people-oriented and democratic nature of our state power.

The message to the people calls on all the people to spare no effort to fulfill the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Workers should always stand at the forefront of the struggle to build socialism, resolutely implement the Party's instructions to produce more, faster, better, and of higher quality, adhere to the great principle of self-reliance, and overfulfill production plans. Promote and support advanced production experience. Socialism's property should be protected like the apple of one's eye, and actively and bravely participate in the management and supervision of production. Members of cooperatives should further strive to develop agricultural production, reclaim wasteland, implement the Party's great call to transform hills and mountains into fertile land, and persistently struggle to ensure food self-sufficiency for each cooperative, each commune, and each district. Ensuring national food self-sufficiency is a great task of national economic and political significance. Intellectuals should dedicate all their talents to the motherland, closely link with the people, with the broad masses of workers and peasants, listen to their opinions, and be deserving students of the working people.

The message to the people finally said, without waging a struggle against all the forces and traditions of the old society, we cannot advance towards socialism. Every member of the Democratic Front should become a passionate warrior for breaking with the old and establishing the new, constantly wage class struggle, and become an unyielding fighter for establishing new things and for the cause of revolution and socialism.

    阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会通过告人民书
　　进一步实现革命化为社会主义事业而奋斗
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会十六日通过了告阿尔巴尼亚人民书。
    告人民书说，今天，社会主义革命正在沿着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会确定的道路在各个方面胜利地深入开展。人民的觉悟、世界观、生活和工作进一步革命化。在国家生活和全国人民当中正在发生政治、思想和经济上的深刻变化。
    告人民书说，同我国人民有着兄弟般的、真诚的和国际主义友谊的中华人民共和国，在毛泽东同志的领导下，正在胜利地开展无产阶级文化大革命，成了世界革命和社会主义的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    告人民书说，越南人民神奇般的英勇战斗给美帝国主义者以致命打击。阿拉伯人民的斗争，亚非拉人民的斗争日益发展和扩大，给予帝国主义势力以沉重的打击，并揭露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛。阿尔巴尼亚人民毫无保留地支持全世界人民反对剥削和压迫，争取自由、独立和社会主义的斗争，并且相信伟大的解放斗争的烈火，将把帝国主义者和修正主义者烧成灰烬。
    告人民书说，民主阵线第四次代表大会再一次充分地体现了我国人民的战斗团结和他们巩固、加强这一团结的决心。
    告人民书说，民主阵线在日常活动中继承和体现了我国人民世代以来的爱国主义革命传统。年轻一代要始终保持热爱自由和革命精神的活力并加以发扬。
    告人民书指出，民主阵线的任务是要经常保持我国人民的高度的革命警惕性和捍卫社会主义祖国的战备观念。时刻都不要忘记，我们的国家是在帝国主义和修正主义者的包围和封锁的条件下进行革命和在社会主义道路上前进的，我国人民和社会主义的死敌——帝国主义者，赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义者，希腊保皇法西斯和各国反动派，制造各种阴谋诡计，反对我国人民和我们的国家。
    为此，民主阵线号召工人、农民、知识分子、男女青年和阵线的全体成员，要自觉地厉行捍卫祖国的神圣任务，积极参加体力锻炼和军事训练，随时准备响应党的一手拿镐，一手拿枪的号召。
    告人民书呼吁民主阵线成员积极参加国家机关的一切活动，广泛地贯彻社会主义民主，对每件事物发表自己的意见，对国家机关和在机关工作的人进行人民的监督，对不管是何人何地的官僚主义表现进行无情的斗争，对任何稍能削弱无产阶级专政和侵害富有彻底人民性和民主性的我国政权的各种行为和表现经常保持高度的警惕。
    告人民书号召全体人民竭尽全力完成第四个五年计划。工人们应当永远站在建设社会主义斗争的前列，坚决贯彻党的多、快、省、高质量地进行生产的指示，坚持贯彻自力更生的伟大原则，超额完成生产计划。推广和支持先进的生产经验。应该象保护眼珠一样保护社会主义财产，积极地和勇敢地参加对生产的管理和监督。合作社社员应当进一步努力发展农业生产，开垦荒地，贯彻党提出的把丘陵和高山改变成富饶的土地的伟大号召，坚持不渝地为使每个合作社，每个乡和每个区保证粮食自给而斗争。保证国家粮食自给，是具有伟大经济和政治意义的全国性任务。知识分子应当把自己的一切才能献给祖国，同人民、同广大工农群众紧密联系，听取他们的意见，做劳动人民当之无愧的学生。
    告人民书最后说，不进行反对旧社会的一切势力和传统的斗争，我们向社会主义迈进就不可能实现。民主阵线的每个成员应当成为破旧立新的热情战士，不断开展阶级斗争，成为树立新事物、为革命和社会主义事业而斗争的坚强不屈的战士。
