The Internationale (Song)

Words by Eugène Pottier
Music by Pierre Degeyter
Solemn and majestic

Note: The term “Internationale” is a phonetic transcription from French. In many countries around the world, the translations of “The Internationale” use this phonetic transcription. “The Internationale will be realized” means that the ideal of international communism will definitely be realized worldwide.

Editor's Note:

Drums roll, victory after victory, amid the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the glorious year of 1967 is approaching its National Day.

This year's National Day comes amid the new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle.

This year's National Day comes amid the new high tide of revolutionary great alliance.

This year's National Day comes amid the new high tide of the broad revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao's teachings to launch the movement of "grasp revolution, promote production."

This year's National Day comes amid the new high tide of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians following Chairman Mao's instructions to enthusiastically launch the "support the army, love the people" movement.

This year's National Day comes amid the new high tide of the broad revolutionary masses responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to launch the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and applying them to practice.

In all good things, it is Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership that is good; in all victories, it is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Let us sing loudly in praise of the great leader Chairman Mao, and joyfully celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, our newspaper publishes the recommended song for the 1967 National Day. Tomorrow, we will continue to publish more. Please, comrades, actively learn and sing them.

    国际歌（歌曲）
　　鲍狄埃  词
    狄盖特  曲
    庄严、雄伟
    注：“英特纳雄耐尔”一词是按法文音译的，世界上许多国家翻译的《国际歌》，对这个词都用音译。“英特纳雄耐尔就一定要实现”，意思是说国际共产主义的理想一定要在全世界实现。
    编者的话：
    锣鼓喧天，捷报频传，在无产阶级文化大革命的阵阵凯歌声中，伟大的一九六七年国庆节就要到来了。
    今年的国庆节，是在革命的大批判的新高潮中到来的。
    今年的国庆节，是在革命的大联合的新高潮中到来的。
    今年的国庆节，是在广大革命群众遵循毛主席的教导，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮中到来的。
    今年的国庆节，是在广大军民遵循毛主席的指示，热烈展开“拥军爱民”运动的新高潮中到来的。
    今年的国庆节，是在广大革命群众响应林彪同志的号召，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮中到来的。
    千好万好，都是毛主席的英明领导好；千胜利万胜利，都是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。让我们放声歌唱伟大的领袖毛主席，纵情欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    今天本报发表了一九六七年国庆节推荐歌曲，明天将继续发表，请同志们积极学唱。
