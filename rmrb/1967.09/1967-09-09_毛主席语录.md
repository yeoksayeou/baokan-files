To distinguish between the reactionaries and the revolutionaries, to expose the reactionaries' plots and tricks, to arouse the vigilance and attention of the revolutionaries, to boost our morale and shatter the enemy's arrogance, we must isolate the reactionaries and defeat them or replace them.

　　毛主席语录
    划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之。
                                      《论人民民主专政》
