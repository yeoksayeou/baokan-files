The investigation report published in today's newspaper about the "Four Cleans" campaign in the Taoyuan Brigade exposes the crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, who advocates a pseudo-left, rightist bourgeois reactionary line, sabotages the socialist education movement, and attempts to restore capitalism.

This investigation report is a blood-stained indictment by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan Brigade. It is another ironclad piece of evidence of the treacherous anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The socialist education movement in cities and countryside was initiated by our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao personally drafted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Current Questions in Rural Work" (the Ten Points) and the "Several Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the Twenty-three Points), which set forth a series of correct policies and guidelines for the "Four Cleans" campaign. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the "Four Cleans" campaign has achieved great successes.

In these two documents of great historical significance, Chairman Mao pointed out: This great socialist education movement aims to mobilize the masses, focus on rectifying those within the Party who take the capitalist road, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao's line is to solve the extremely important question of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line and a creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

The Chinese Khrushchev stands on the reactionary position of the overthrown landlord and bourgeois classes, representing the interests of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power. He is terrified and hates to the core the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and this great revolution. He advocates a pseudo-left, rightist bourgeois reactionary line, launching a full-scale attack on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He dispatched his wife, the bourgeois element Wang XX, to Taoyuan to conduct so-called "on-the-spot investigation," aiming to turn Taoyuan into a black experimental ground for his pseudo-left, rightist bourgeois reactionary line, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He also meticulously fabricated a so-called "Taoyuan Experience," blowing it up and shamelessly peddling it everywhere; even usurping the name of the Central Committee to promote it nationwide. This is a well-planned, purposeful, and organized conspiracy to usurp the Party and the state.

In the socialist education movement, the pseudo-left, rightist bourgeois reactionary line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is fully exposed in the "Four Cleans" campaign in the Taoyuan Brigade.

The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "contradictions between the Four Cleans and the Four Uncleans" is a blatant distortion of the nature of the "Four Cleans" campaign, deliberately covering up the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, diverting the direction of the struggle, attacking a broad swath, and protecting a handful.

The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "solving whatever problems exist" is to create excuses to persecute cadres and community members, suppress revolutionary masses, and lead the "Four Cleans" campaign astray.

The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "rooting and linking up" is a frenzied opposition to Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy and practice of using class analysis to conduct social investigations, a frenzied opposition to revolutionary mass movements, so that they can form cliques, win over defectors, cultivate, and develop the social base for the restoration of capitalism.

All of these are aimed at protecting a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and rescuing the doomed exploiting classes.

This is a set of thorough and unadulterated counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also for the purpose of maintaining their power." After the proletariat's victory in the revolution, the overthrown exploiting classes and the counter-revolutionary forces representing them will always try every means and seize every opportunity to snatch the power back from the proletariat. The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the backer of a handful of capitalist-roaders nationwide and the representative of the overthrown exploiting classes within the Party. He advocates a pseudo-left, rightist reactionary line, attacking a broad swath and protecting a handful, aiming to seize the proletariat's power, turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and restore capitalism.

Under the meticulous planning of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, the power in the Taoyuan Brigade fell into the hands of the bad elements, who acted at will and imposed fascist rule. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres were in a position of being attacked and persecuted. This is a genuine example of the restoration of capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to promote such "Taoyuan Experience" nationwide. It is not difficult to imagine that if his conspiracy succeeds, our socialist country will suffer a great setback, our country will change color, and millions and millions of working people will be pushed back into the sea of suffering. How can we not be highly alert and take this lightly!

The struggle between the two lines in the socialist education movement is an extremely fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, and between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters. In this great struggle, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has triumphed, and the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line has failed.

The facts fully prove that the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, with the Chinese Khrushchev as the ringleader, are the most important and dangerous enemies of the proletariat. They are a group of ferocious counter-revolutionary revisionists who, at every critical juncture of the proletarian revolution, jump out to stir up trouble and sabotage. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overthrow them, to thoroughly defeat them. Not only must we seize their power organizationally, but we must also defeat them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Only in this way can we prevent the historical regression of the restoration of capitalism by the Soviet revisionist clique from being repeated in our country.

Currently, the whole country is launching a comprehensive revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. For such a heinous capitalist-roader, we must settle his accounts one by one. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the revolutionary criticism movement, and strive for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 揭开一个复辟资本主义的大阴谋

　　揭开一个复辟资本主义的大阴谋
    今天，本报发表的关于桃园大队“四清”情况的调查报告，揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，破坏社会主义教育运动，实行资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。
    这个调查报告，是桃园大队贫下中农的一份血泪控诉书，是中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的又一个铁的罪证。
    城乡社会主义教育运动，是我们伟大领袖毛主席提出来的。毛主席亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》（即十条）和《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条），为四清运动规定了一系列正确的方针政策。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，四清运动取得了伟大的成就。
    在毛主席制定的这两个具有伟大历史意义的文件中指出：这一场伟大的社会主义教育运动，就是要放手发动群众，重点整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派，进一步加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。
    毛主席制定的这条路线，就是要解决在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的极端重要的问题，是一条马克思列宁主义的革命路线，是对马克思列宁主义的创造性的发展。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，他站在被推翻的地主阶级和资产阶级的反动立场上，代表了那些一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的利益，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对这一场伟大的革命，怕得要死，恨得要命，拚命地反对这场革命。他抛出了一条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进行全面的进攻。他指派他的老婆资产阶级分子王××到桃园搞所谓“蹲点”，就是要把桃园变成他推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线、反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的黑试验场。他还精心地炮制了一个所谓“桃园经验”，大吹大擂，敲锣打鼓，恬不知耻地到处兜售；甚至盗用中央的名义，把它向全国推广。这完全是一个有计划、有目的、有组织地篡党篡国的大阴谋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在社会主义教育运动中，所推行的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，究竟是什么货色，在桃园大队的“四清”运动中，暴露得最彻底。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓什么“四清和四不清的矛盾”，就是明目张胆地篡改四清运动的性质，故意掩盖无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，转移斗争大方向，打击一大片，保护一小撮。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓什么“有什么问题解决什么问题”，就是要制造借口，大整干部，大整社员，镇压革命群众，把四清运动引到邪路上去。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓什么“扎根串连”，就是疯狂反对毛主席历来主张、历来实行的用阶级分析方法去向社会作调查，疯狂反对革命群众运动，以便他们结党营私，招降纳叛，培植和发展复辟资本主义的社会基础。
    所有这些，都是为了要保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，挽救剥削阶级的最后灭亡。
    这是一套彻头彻尾不折不扣的反革命修正主义的黑货。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”无产阶级取得革命胜利以后，失去了政权的剥削阶级和代表他们的反革命势力，总是要千方百计，利用一切机会，从无产阶级手里把政权夺回去。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是全国一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的总后台，是被打倒的剥削阶级在党内的总代表。他所以要推行形“左”实右的反动路线，打击一大片，保护一小撮，其目的就是为了夺取无产阶级的政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的精心策划下，桃园大队政权落到了坏人手里，他们为所欲为，实行法西斯统治。贫下中农和革命干部处于受打击受迫害的地位。这是一个地地道道的资本主义复辟的活样板。中国的赫鲁晓夫还要把这样的“桃园经验”推广到全国。不难设想，他的这个阴谋一旦得逞，我们的社会主义国家就要出现大倒退，我们国家就要改变颜色，千千万万劳动人民就要重新被推到苦海之中。这是多么危险的情景呀！我们怎能不引起高度的警惕，怎能掉以轻心！
    社会主义教育运动中这一场两条路线的激烈斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间的一场极其激烈的大搏斗，是无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部两个司令部之间的一场极其激烈的大搏斗。在这一场大搏斗中，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利了，中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线失败了。
    事实完全证明：隐藏在我们党内的、以中国赫鲁晓夫为总头目的最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是无产阶级最主要最危险的敌人。他们是一群凶恶的反革命修正主义分子，在无产阶级革命的每个重要关头，他们都要跳出来，兴风作浪，破坏捣乱。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要革他们的命，就是要把他们彻底打倒。不仅要从组织上夺他们的权，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们斗倒斗臭。只有这样，才能使苏联修正主义集团篡夺党和国家的领导权、实行资本主义复辟的历史大倒退，不致在我国重演。
    当前，全国正在展开对中国赫鲁晓夫全面的革命大批判，对于这样恶贯满盈的最大的走资本主义道路当权派，他的黑账我们必须一笔一笔地清算。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加革命的大批判运动，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命全面的彻底的胜利！
                                              （九月六日）
