	The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the whole world should have courage, dare to fight, be not afraid of difficulties and sacrifice, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed.

		From the "Statement in Support of the Congolese (L.) People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression"
