Indian aggressor troops, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, brazenly crossed the border to attack our border defense forces.

China's Most Severe Protest Against Indian Reactionary Armed Invasion

We solemnly warn the Indian reactionary government: Do not misjudge the situation and repeat the mistake of 1962. The great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to defend the sacred territory of the motherland, will give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade. The Indian government must immediately stop and turn back from the brink, halt the aggression, otherwise it must bear full responsibility.

New China News Agency, September 11th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China tonight sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China, expressing the most urgent and severe protest against the Indian aggressor troops crossing the China-Sikkim border at the Natu La Pass and attacking Chinese border defense forces.

The note pointed out: On the morning of September 11, 1967, at 7:40 AM, more than 60 Indian aggressor troops crossed the China-Sikkim border at the Natu La Pass and invaded Chinese territory. Under the cover of heavy artillery fire, the Indian troops launched an attack on the Chinese border defense forces. Subsequently, the Indian troops also opened fire on the Chinese border defense forces at the Zeli La Pass. By noon, the Indian aggressor troops had killed and wounded 25 Chinese border defense personnel, and the Indian troops had also destroyed Chinese civilian houses and temples. At present, the Indian aggressor troops' attack on the Chinese border defense forces is still ongoing. The Chinese government and people are extremely indignant at this extremely serious armed aggression crime plotted by the Indian reactionary government. The Chinese government expresses the most urgent and severe protest to the Indian government.

The note said: After suffering a crushing defeat in the large-scale armed invasion against China in 1962, the Indian reactionary government has never stopped its aggression and provocation against China along the Sino-Indian and Sino-Sikkim borders. Especially recently, under the conspiracy and instigation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the Indian reactionaries have further intensified their military provocations against China, to the point of brazenly launching armed attacks on Chinese border defense forces, which is extremely arrogant.

The note said: The Chinese government solemnly warns the Indian reactionary government: Do not misjudge the situation and repeat the mistake of 1962. The great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to defend the sacred territory of the motherland, will give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade. The Indian government must immediately stop and turn back from the brink, halt the aggression and provocation and military adventurism against China. Otherwise, the Indian government must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences that may arise. The Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands.

This afternoon at 3 PM, the responsible person from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Indian Embassy in China, Shati, to express the most urgent and severe protest against this extremely serious armed aggression crime plotted by the Indian reactionary government.

    印度侵略军在美帝苏修策动下明目张胆越境进攻我边防部队
    我国最严重抗议印度反动派武装侵略
    严重警告印度反动政府：你们不要错误估计了形势，重蹈一九六二年覆辙。伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军为了保卫祖国神圣领土，对于任何敢于来犯敌人，必将给予毁灭性打击。印度政府必须立即悬崖勒马，停止侵略，否则必须承担全部责任
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天晚上照会印度驻华大使馆，对印度侵略军在乃堆拉山口越过中锡边界，向中国边防部队发起攻击，提出最紧急、最严重的抗议。
    照会指出：一九六七年九月十一日上午七时四十分，印度侵略军六十余人在乃堆拉山口越过中国—锡金边界，侵入中国境内。印军在猛烈炮火掩护下，向中国边防部队发起攻击。接着，印军又向则里拉山口的中国边防部队开炮射击。截至中午，印度侵略军已打死打伤中国边防部队二十五人，印军还击毁了中国的民房和寺庙。现在印度侵略军对中国边防部队的进攻还在继续进行。对于印度反动政府一手策划的这一极其严重的武装侵略罪行，中国政府和中国人民表示万分愤慨。中国政府向印度政府提出最紧急、最严重的抗议。
    照会说：印度反动政府在一九六二年对中国的大规模武装进攻遭到惨败之后，一直没有停止过它在中印、中锡边境对中国的侵略和挑衅。尤其是最近，在美帝、苏修的阴谋策动之下，印度反动派进一步加紧了对中国的军事挑衅活动，以至明目张胆地对中国边防部队发动武装进攻，真是猖狂已极。
    照会说：中国政府严重警告印度反动政府：你们不要错误估计了形势，重蹈一九六二年的覆辙。伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军为了保卫祖国的神圣领土，对于任何敢于来犯的敌人，必将给予毁灭性的打击。印度政府必须立即悬崖勒马，停止对中国的侵略挑衅和军事冒险。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，印度政府必须承担全部责任。
    中国政府保留提出进一步要求的权利。
    今天下午三时，我外交部第一亚洲司负责人曾召见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，就印度反动政府一手策划的这一极其严重的武装侵略罪行，提出最紧急、最严重的抗议。
