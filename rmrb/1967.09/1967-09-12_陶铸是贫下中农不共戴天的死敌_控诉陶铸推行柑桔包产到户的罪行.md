Thunderclaps open the new era, and the east wind sweeps away the remnants of the clouds. The great enemy of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the agent of Khrushchev in China in the Central South region, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu has been exposed. We cheer a thousand times and applaud a million times! We shout: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us to advance, speaking the words in our hearts. We poor and lower-middle peasants follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have embarked on the bright path of socialism. However, the tyrant Tao Zhu tries every means to drag us back to the capitalist road. He seizes the temporary economic difficulties of the state as a rare opportunity for capitalist restoration, colluding with Khrushchev in China, and stirring up a black wind of household contract responsibility system (essentially individual farming) in the countryside, attempting to undermine the socialist system in the countryside and topple the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao severely criticized some places that, with the support of Khrushchev in China, stirred up a black wind of individual farming. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu did not take this as a warning to reform himself. Instead, immediately after the meeting ended, in October 1962, he hurriedly slipped into our Huancheng Commune and even more brazenly peddled the household contract responsibility system of his master Khrushchev in China.

Tao Zhu, in order to restore capitalism in all aspects of agricultural production, openly declared: It is not enough to just implement the household contract responsibility system for grain crops; citrus, sugarcane, and other economic crops must also follow the example of rice and implement the household contract responsibility system.

Our commune is the main citrus-producing area in Xinhui County, with a total citrus cultivation area of over ten thousand mu. Tao Zhu actually took our commune as a pilot for implementing the household contract responsibility system for citrus. He rolled up his sleeves and personally attended "discussion meetings" in the citrus-producing villages of Chaqian, Tianlu, and Dongjia, spreading poisonous winds and igniting ghost fires, peddling his black goods. He was afraid that the attendees would not respond to the household contract responsibility system, so he specially invited some upper-middle peasants to participate in the meeting. At the meeting, he distorted black and white, attributing the poor citrus production at that time, which was due to a lack of fertilizer and natural disasters, to the "systemic problems" of the people's commune. He slandered the collective labor of the people's commune as "duck in a basket" and "poor production." He believed that to restore citrus production, the household contract responsibility system must be implemented. He even said, "It can be contracted for one year, or five years, or even ten years."

We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered the most and were oppressed the heaviest in the old society; we hate the evil old society the most; we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and firmly walk the path of socialist collectivization as indicated by Chairman Mao. Therefore, as soon as Tao Zhu proposed the reactionary suggestion of the household contract responsibility system, it was immediately opposed by us poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the two-faced Tao Zhu, using his usurped power, used both soft and hard tactics, saying that as long as one is willing to implement the household contract responsibility system, he can "approve" it, and if there are problems, he will "take responsibility." He even openly issued orders to the county committee: "In the future, chemical fertilizers supported by the state for collective production 'must not be issued to the production teams' and must be directly issued to individual commune members to 'solve the difficulties in the household contract responsibility system.'" Under his instructions, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the original county committee organized a "work team" to forcibly implement the household contract responsibility system in our commune. Thus, a black wind of citrus household contract responsibility system swept through the entire commune. Most of the citrus in various villages were contracted for one year, some for a few years, and even some for ten years.

Once the citrus household contract responsibility system was implemented, it brought extremely serious consequences. It "mobilized" the capitalist individual production enthusiasm, suppressed the socialist collective production enthusiasm, and undermined the collective economy of the people's commune. Due to the citrus household contract responsibility system, the base crops were also contracted for individual production, with more or less harvest belonging to oneself. Many villages' landlords, rich peasants, and upper-middle peasants, in order to obtain the maximum "overproduction" and the highest income, adopted the method of "filling every gap and fighting for every inch of land," arbitrarily expanding the base crop planting area, planting a large number of intercropped crops, and not hesitating to injure or kill the citrus trees. At the same time, in management, they neglected the long-term for the short-term, resulting in a large number of citrus trees dying due to poor management, seriously harming the development of the collective economy. In just one year, the entire commune destroyed more than four thousand mu of citrus and other fruit trees, causing a loss of over two hundred ten thousand yuan. If we continue to contract according to Tao Zhu's black directive of "contracting for ten years," would our collective economy not collapse? Tao Zhu's heart is so poisonous!

What does Tao Zhu's promotion of the citrus household contract responsibility system serve? The facts speak for themselves. Landlords, rich peasants, and some rich peasants with serious spontaneous capitalist tendencies, as soon as they heard about the household contract responsibility system, cheered and clapped their hands, saying, "Fields follow people, citrus and vegetables return to their original homes, each person's quick hands reap their own." They seized this opportunity to make a fortune. While the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were the victims, especially those with many people and weak labor, whose lives were difficult, suffered even more. Tianlu Village had a poor peasant family of five, who in 1963 contracted seven mu and nine fen of citrus land. Due to weak labor, lack of production funds, and pest damage, the citrus failed, and they were fined 170 yuan, bringing great difficulties to the family's life. While the same village had a rich peasant family of nineteen, with ten laborers. In 1963, they contracted two mu and one fen of citrus and other economic crops. Due to strong labor and sufficient production funds, they achieved "overproduction." This rich peasant family also transported the "overproduction" part of the products to the free market for high-price sales, illegally making huge profits. Therefore, the family's total income for the year (including the year-end distribution income) reached 12,000 yuan, accounting for 17% of the total income of 112 households and 570 people in the entire village. Thus, polarization appeared in the countryside, greatly boosting the momentum of capitalist forces in the countryside and dampening the spirit of poor and lower-middle peasants. Ironclad facts show that Tao Zhu is the "great benefactor" of the class enemies and the blood enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the struggle between socialism and capitalism, no matter how great the evil winds and waves, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line always guides us from victory to victory. While Khrushchev in China and the likes of Tao Zhu want us to take the backward road of household contract responsibility system and individual farming, it is the death road for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we cannot take it by any means. Therefore, after one year of citrus household contract responsibility system, this reactionary system was overthrown by the poor and lower-middle peasants of various villages in our commune. However, the root of the disaster has not been removed, and the poison has not been purged. Now, the culprits who promoted the household contract responsibility system in our commune, Khrushchev in China and Tao Zhu, have been exposed. We must rise up with the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, knock down Khrushchev in China and Tao Zhu, and stomp on them with another foot, making them never able to rise again. We must thoroughly purge all the poison of the household contract responsibility system they advocated, uproot the roots of revisionism, further consolidate and develop the collective economy of the people's commune, and build our great motherland's countryside into an ever-shining land of Mao Zedong Thought, a bright red, and unchanging proletarian iron fortress.

    陶铸是贫下中农不共戴天的死敌
    ——控诉陶铸推行柑桔包产到户的罪行
    新会县环城公社贫下中农革命造反派联合委员会
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。
    广大贫下中农的死敌、中国赫鲁晓夫在中南地区的代理人、反革命修正主义分子陶铸被揪出来了，我们一千个叫好！一万个叫好！我们欢呼：毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”毛主席给我们指明了前进的方向，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。我们贫下中农按照毛主席的教导走上了社会主义的光明大道。可是，南霸天陶铸，却千方百计要把我们拉回资本主义的邪路上去。他把国家的暂时经济困难当作资本主义复辟的千载难逢之机，与中国赫鲁晓夫北呼南应，在农村刮起一股包产到户（实质是单干）的黑风，妄图在农村瓦解社会主义制度，搞垮无产阶级专政。
    一九六二年，在党的八届十中全会上，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，严厉地批判了当时一些地方在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下刮起单干的黑风。但是，反革命修正主义分子陶铸没有引以为戒，洗心革面，反而在会议结束以后，即一九六二年十月，急忙地溜到我们环城公社，更加变本加厉地兜售他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫包产到户的黑货。
    陶铸为了在农业生产各个方面复辟资本主义，公然叫嚣：光搞粮食作物包产到户还不行，柑桔、甘蔗以及其他经济作物也要向水稻看齐，实行包产到户。
    我们公社是新会县柑桔的主要产区，柑桔种植总面积达一万多亩。陶铸居然把我们公社作为实行柑桔包产到户的试点。他赤膊上阵，亲自到全社盛产柑桔的茶坑、天禄、东甲等大队开“座谈会”，煽阴风，点鬼火，贩卖他的黑货。他做贼心虚，害怕到会的人不响应包产到户，特地请一些上中农来参加会议。会上，他颠倒黑白，把当时由于缺乏肥料和自然灾害造成柑桔生产不好的现象，歪曲为是人民公社的“体制问题”所造成的。他污蔑人民公社的集体劳动是“大笼鸭”，“搞不好生产”。他认为要恢复柑桔生产，就要实行包产到户。还说什么“包一年也可以，包五年、十年也可以”。
    我们贫下中农在旧社会受苦最深、受压迫最重，最仇恨万恶的旧社会；最听毛主席的话，最坚定地走毛主席所指引的社会主义集体化道路。因此，陶铸一提出包产到户的反动主张，当即遭到我们贫下中农的反对。但是，两面三刀的陶铸，利用他所窃踞的职权，软硬兼施，说什么只要愿意包产到户，可以由他“批准”，如果出了问题由他“负责”。他甚至公然向县委发出命令：以后国家支援集体生产的化肥，“不准发到生产队”，要直接发给社员个人“解决包产到户中的困难”。在他的指使下，原县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就专门组织了一支包产到户的“工作队”，来我社强制执行。这样，一股柑桔包产到户的黑风就在全社刮起来了。各大队的柑桔绝大部分都实行包产到户。有的包一年，有的包几年，甚至有的包十年。
    柑桔包产到户一经实行，就带来了极其严重的恶果。它“调动”了资本主义个体生产积极性，打击了社会主义集体生产积极性，瓦解着人民公社集体经济。由于柑桔包产到户，基面作物也同样包产到户，收多收少归自己。许多大队的地主、富农和上中农，为了取得最大的“超产”和最高的收入，采取“见缝插针，寸土必争”的手段，任意扩大基地种植面积，大量间种作物，不惜把柑树锄伤、锄死。同时，在管理上又顾短轻长，致使大量柑桔因管理不周而死亡，严重地危害了集体经济的发展。仅仅一年时间，全社一共搞垮柑桔等果树四千多亩，损失二百多万元。如果按照陶铸“一包十年”的黑指示继续包下去，我们的集体经济不就垮台了吗？陶铸之心，何其毒也！
    陶铸推行柑桔包产到户究竟为谁服务？看看事实就一清二楚。地主、富农和一些具有严重的资本主义自发倾向的富裕农民，一听到要包产到户，就齐声叫好，拍手称快。他们说：“田跟人，柑葵还老家，各人手快各人扒”。他们就乘这个机会大发横财。而广大贫下中农则是受害者，特别是那些人多劳力弱、生活有困难的贫下中农，受害更为严重。天禄大队有一户贫农，全家五口人，一九六三年承包柑桔七分九厘地，由于劳动力弱，生产资金少，又遇虫害，结果柑桔失收，被罚款一百七十元，给家庭生活带来了很大的困难。而该大队有一户富农，全家十九个人，有十个劳动力。一九六三年承包柑桔等经济作物二亩一分地，由于劳动力强，生产资金又足，获得“超产”。这户富农还把“超产”部分的产品运到自由市场高价出售，非法牟取暴利，因此，全家一年总收入（包括年终分配收入数）就达一万二千元，占全队一百一十二户、五百七十人总收入的百分之十七。这样，在农村就出现了两极分化，大长了农村资本主义势力的威风，大灭了贫下中农的志气。铁的事实说明，陶铸是阶级敌人的“大恩人”，是我们贫下中农不共戴天的死敌。
    在社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争中，无论遇到多大的妖风恶浪，毛主席的革命路线始终引导着我们从胜利走向胜利。而中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸之流要我们走包产到户和单干的回头路，是我们贫下中农的断头路，我们贫下中农一千个不能走，一万个不能走。因此，柑桔包产到户一年后，这个反动的制度就被我们公社各大队的贫下中农推翻了。但是，祸根未除，流毒还未肃清。现在把在我社推行包产到户的罪魁祸首中国的赫鲁晓夫和陶铸揪出来了。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和陶铸打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身。我们一定要彻底肃清他们鼓吹的包产到户的一切流毒，拔掉修正主义的根子，进一步巩固和发展人民公社的集体经济，把伟大祖国的农村建设成为一个永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的、红彤彤的、永不变色的无产阶级铁打江山。		　（原载《南方日报》）
