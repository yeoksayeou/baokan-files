	The Myth of "Peaceful Transition" Exposed
	Wu Zaichi

	Twenty years ago, the Chinese Khrushchev, who donned the cloak of an "old revolutionary," adapted to the needs of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Amidst Chiang Kai-shek's active preparations for civil war and the clamor of sharpening swords, he spread the poisonous weed of a "new stage of peaceful democracy" and hoisted the banner of "peaceful transition." However, the thunderous cannon fire of Chiang Kai-shek's full-scale civil war shattered this "old revolutionary's" dream of becoming an official in Chiang's central government. This lucrative deal was thus completely ruined!

	However, this "old revolutionary" did not change his reactionary nature. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, he once again peddled his already bankrupt theory of "peaceful transition" everywhere, selling the tattered remnants of "non-violent revolution" he had picked up from his mentor Bernstein, Kautsky, and his fellow traitor Khrushchev.

	In the spring of 1963, the Chinese Khrushchev visited Burma and actually believed that this country could undergo a "peaceful transition," claiming that this country had the "possibility of moving from pseudo-socialism to true socialism." However, the Ne Win reactionary government, which this "old revolutionary" boasted could "possibly move towards true socialism," is precisely the extremely reactionary fascist military clique that has never stopped "exterminating the communists" and is today even more brutally suppressing the revolutionary forces within Burma and frenziedly anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese. This "old revolutionary's" concocted myth of "peaceful transition" was once again shattered by the blood-curdling gunshots of the reactionary ruling class!

	Whether it is violent revolution or "peaceful transition," it has always been the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in the international communist movement and the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in the post-war national liberation movement. The facts are clear: in countries where the bourgeoisie and reactionaries continually strengthen the bourgeois dictatorship and frenziedly suppress the revolutionary movements of the people, there has not been a single country in the world that has achieved revolutionary victory without armed struggle. On the contrary, there are many examples of those who have suffered bitter defeats due to the implementation of Khrushchev and his disciples' revisionist line of "peaceful transition."

	For example, the Iraqi Communist Party, under external pressure, was forced to accept Khrushchev's revisionist line of "peaceful transition." As a result, they were caught off guard in a counter-revolutionary coup, and a part of the party's leadership and tens of thousands of party members and revolutionary masses were brutally massacred.

	For example, the Indonesian Communist Party, influenced by Khrushchev's advocacy of the revisionist line of "peaceful transition," relaxed its vigilance against the growing right-wing forces. As a result, a powerful party organization was destroyed, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses were beheaded, rivers of blood flowed, and the revolutionary cause suffered a severe setback.

	Enough! Are these bloody realities not enough to show that the "peaceful transition" peddled by this "old revolutionary" is a poison that kills the revolutions of the people of various countries?!

	We must never forget the tragic and profound slogan shouted by the leaders of the Iraqi Communist Party before their execution: "Down with Khrushchev! Long live Mao Zedong!" This is the truth they learned with their blood!

	The revolutionaries of Indonesia have realized that, "based on the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, especially Mao Zedong's thesis that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,'" "we must take the road of armed revolution against armed counter-revolution."

	Today, the flames of national liberation wars and people's armed struggles are burning in the lands of South Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, Congo (Kinshasa), and other countries. The great revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, through their personal revolutionary practices, increasingly clearly understand the great truth summarized by Chairman Mao that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and understand that armed struggle is the only correct road for the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to struggle for liberation. At the same time, they also understand that the so-called revisionist road of "peaceful transition" is a road of party destruction, national destruction, and beheading!

	"By the wrecked ship, a thousand sails pass by; before the withered tree, ten thousand flowers bloom."

	The revolutionary peoples of the world, while throwing this great traitor of the world proletarian revolutionary camp, along with his myth of "peaceful transition," into the garbage bin of history, are advancing victoriously along the broad and smooth road indicated by the great teacher Chairman Mao!

　　“和平过渡”神话的破产
　　伍再驰
    早在二十年前，披着“老革命”外衣的中国的赫鲁晓夫，就适应美帝国主义和国民党反动派的需要，在蒋介石积极准备内战的磨刀霍霍声中，放出了“和平民主新阶段”的大毒草，打出了“和平过渡”的招牌。然而蒋介石发动全面内战的隆隆炮声，打破了这个“老革命”想到蒋介石的中央政府“当官”的美梦。这一笔“赚钱”的买卖也就彻底告吹了！
    可是这个“老革命”的反动本性不改。中华人民共和国成立以后，他又四出推销他的那套早已破产了的“和平过渡”的谬论，到处贩卖从他的祖师爷伯恩斯坦、考茨基以及他的难兄赫鲁晓夫那儿拣来的“非暴力革命”的破烂。
    一九六三年春，中国的赫鲁晓夫访问缅甸时，居然认为这个国家可以“和平过渡”，说什么这个国家“有可能从假社会主义走向真社会主义”。但是，被这个“老革命”吹嘘为“可能走向真社会主义”的奈温反动政府，正是多年来没有停止“剿共”，而今天又更加残酷镇压缅甸国内革命力量，疯狂反华排华的极端反动的法西斯军人集团。这个“老革命”炮制的“和平过渡”的神话，又一次被反动统治阶级血腥的枪声所粉碎！
    是暴力革命还是“和平过渡”，从来就是国际共产主义运动中两条路线斗争的集中点，也是战后民族解放运动中两条路线斗争的焦点。事实很清楚，在各国资产阶级及反动派不断强化资产阶级专政的国家机器、疯狂镇压各国人民的革命运动的情况下，在全世界，还没有任何一个不经过武装斗争而取得革命胜利的国家。相反，因执行赫鲁晓夫及其门徒的“和平过渡”修正主义路线而惨遭失败的，却不乏其例。
    象伊拉克共产党，由于外来的压力，强使他们接受了赫鲁晓夫的“和平过渡”修正主义路线，结果，在反革命武装政变中措手不及，使一部分党的领导人和成千上万的党员和革命群众惨遭杀害。
    象印尼共产党，也是因为受到赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“和平过渡”的修正主义路线的影响，而对日益增长的右派势力的进攻放松警惕，结果，使强大的党组织遭到破坏，数十万革命群众的头颅落地，血流成河，革命事业遭受严重挫折。
    够了！难道这些血淋淋的现实还不足以说明这个“老革命”所推销的“和平过渡”，是一剂毒杀各国人民革命的砒霜吗？！
    我们决不要忘记，伊拉克共产党领导人在就义前高呼“打倒赫鲁晓夫”、“毛泽东万岁”的悲壮而深刻的口号！这是他们用鲜血悟得的真理啊！
    印尼的革命者认识到，“根据伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，特别是毛泽东同志关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的论断，”“必须走武装的革命反对武装的反革命的道路。”
    今天，民族解放战争和人民武装斗争的烽火，正在南越、老挝、泰国、缅甸、印尼、刚果（金）等国家的土地上燃烧。亚非拉广大革命人民通过亲身的革命实践，越来越清楚地认识到毛主席所总结出的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一伟大的真理，认识到武装斗争的道路是被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的唯一正确的道路。同时，他们也认识到，所谓“和平过渡”的修正主义道路，乃是一条亡党、亡国、亡头的道路！
    “沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春”。
    世界革命人民在把“老革命”这个世界无产阶级革命阵营内部的大叛徒，连同他的“和平过渡”的神话扔进历史的垃圾箱的同时，正沿着伟大导师毛主席所指引的康庄大道胜利前进！
