Albanian Newspaper Severely Condemns Indian Reactionaries for Military Provocations Against Our Country

Indian Reactionaries' Continued Aggression Will Surely Meet with More Humiliating Defeat

BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on Sept. 13 severely condemning the Indian reactionaries for their shameless military provocations against China along the China-Sikkim border. The editorial pointed out that if the Indian reactionaries continue their adventurism, they will surely meet with an even more humiliating defeat than in 1962.

The editorial said that the Albanian people, with extreme indignation, strongly condemn the Indian military's aggression against China along the China-Sikkim border. The editorial pointed out that this serious military provocation is not an isolated incident. It is a continuation of the Indian reactionaries' unrestrained anti-China campaign over the past few years, directly instigated by U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists.

The editorial said: The Indian aggressors suffered a powerful counterattack from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in their 1962 military provocation. However, the enemies of the Chinese people have not learned from their defeat. The Indian reactionaries, following the instructions of their masters, the U.S. imperialists and the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, crossed the China-Sikkim border on Sept. 7 and 11, invading Chinese territory and attacking Chinese border outposts, killing and injuring Chinese border guards. This is a serious and planned military provocation by the Indian reactionary government.

The editorial pointed out: Since 1962, the Indian reactionary government, out of internal and external difficulties, has been continuously provoking China. Due to the Indian reactionaries' eagerness to engage in anti-China activities, the Indian government has received rewards from the U.S. and Soviet revisionists. The full support and aid from the U.S. and Soviet revisionists to the Indian reactionaries are part of the U.S.-Soviet counterrevolutionary global strategy.

The editorial pointed out: The Indian reactionaries' military provocations against China are concurrent with the frenzied anti-China actions by the U.S., Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. They launch anti-China campaigns because China has become a powerful defender of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, a fighter on the front lines for the revolutionary and socialist cause; because China is a reliable backer and the strongest supporter of the heroic Vietnamese people, an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialist-revisionist hegemonic plan.

The editorial said: The enemies of the Chinese people—imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries—are terrified by the magnificent achievements of the Chinese people. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions of eliminating socialist China and changing its color, turning it into a revisionist, capitalist country. The Chinese people are advancing more rapidly on the socialist road, achieving new brilliant victories in the economic and cultural fields, and further strengthening national defense. China has become an indestructible force, an impregnable fortress of socialism and peace, and an insurmountable obstacle to the evil plans of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Indian reactionaries.

The editorial said: The great Chinese people stand as an iron fortress for revolution and socialism. The enemies of the Chinese people have already suffered humiliating defeats. The Chinese people possess all the necessary means to defeat any aggressor.

The editorial finally warned: If the Indian reactionaries continue their dangerous adventurism, they will surely meet with an even more humiliating defeat than in 1962.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸严厉谴责印度反动派向我国进行军事挑衅
    印度反动派继续侵略必将遭到更可耻失败
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十三日发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责印度反动派在中锡边界对中国进行无耻的军事挑衅，并指出如果印度反动派继续进行冒险，必将遭到比一九六二年更加可耻的失败。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民以极其愤怒的心情强烈谴责印军在中锡边界对中国的侵略。文章指出，这一严重的军事挑衅绝不是偶然的。它是印度反动派最近几年来，在美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者直接唆使下掀起的肆无忌惮的反华运动的继续。
    文章说：印度侵略者在一九六二年的军事挑衅中受到了中国人民和中国人民解放军的有力回击。但是，中国人民的敌人并没有从失败中吸取教训。印度反动派仍遵照它的主子美帝国主义者和苏联勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团的指示行动，并在九月七日和十一日，越过中锡边界，侵入中国领土，袭击中国边防哨所，打死打伤中国边防人员。这是印度反动政府有计划、有准备的严重军事挑衅。
    文章指出：自一九六二年以来，印度反动政府就出于内外交困的需要，不断对中国进行挑衅。由于印度反动派热衷于进行反华活动，印度政府得到了美帝苏修的犒赏。美帝苏修对印度反动派的全面支持和援助，是美苏反革命全球战略的一个组成部分。
    文章指出：印度反动派向中国进行的军事挑衅是同美帝、苏修和各国反动派的疯狂反华同时发生的。它们之所以联合掀起反华运动，是因为中国已经成为各国人民自由和独立的强大保卫者，是为革命和社会主义事业而斗争的第一线战士；是因为中国是英雄的越南人民可靠的后盾和最强大的支持者，是帝修霸权计划的不可逾越的障碍。
    文章说：中国人民的敌人——帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，被中国人民的宏伟成就吓破了胆。在毛泽东同志领导下的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进，粉碎了帝国主义者和现代修正主义者妄图消灭社会主义中国、使中国改变颜色，从而变为修正主义、资本主义国家的计划和希望。中国人民在社会主义道路上更加迅速地大踏步前进着，在经济和文化领域里，在进一步加强国防方面取得了新的辉煌胜利。中国已经变成了一支不可摧毁的力量，变成了社会主义与和平的牢不可破的堡垒，变成了美帝、苏修和印度反动派的罪恶计划不能得逞的障碍。
    文章说：伟大的中国人民作为革命和社会主义的钢铁堡垒巍然屹立。中国人民的敌人已经遭到了可耻的失败。中国人民拥有打败任何侵略者的一切必要手段。
    文章最后警告说：如果印度反动派继续进行危险的冒险，它们必将遭到比一九六二年更加可耻的失败。
