	Do Not Allow the Color of the Communist Party to Change
	Sheli Brigade, Sheli Commune, Alcheng County	Ma Cai

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core of leadership for our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis that guides our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." Our party constitution clearly stipulates that "the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class," and its goal is to "completely eliminate the system of exploitation" in China and "achieve communism." However, China's Khrushchev shamelessly shouts, "Even if there are ten thousand rich peasants in the party, it doesn't matter," and even more shamelessly wants party members to lead in hiring workers and leading in exploitation. His goal is to change the nature of our party, turning the proletarian party into a bourgeois party, and realizing his wolfish ambition to restore capitalism in China.

	Under the poisonous influence of this counter-revolutionary fallacy, a few party members of peasant origin in our brigade once took the capitalist road. There is a peasant in our brigade who was an active participant in the land reform and one of the first batch of party members to join the party openly in 1948. He was active and hardworking. However, under the influence of the fallacies of the party's top leader who took the capitalist road, such as leading in hiring workers, leading in exploitation, and allowing individual farming, he gradually changed. During the great socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this comrade who had taken the wrong path received the education of Mao Zedong Thought and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He excitedly denounced:

	"The mistake is on me, but the root cause is with China's Khrushchev. If I continued to follow China's Khrushchev's line of developing rich peasant party members, I would have become a rich peasant, a landlord. This time, Chairman Mao liberated me again. I will forever follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road!"

	This spring, he voluntarily handed over the excess land and small plots he had cultivated, and actively participated in collective production labor.

	If we really follow what China's Khrushchev said, with party members leading in hiring workers, leading in exploitation, and leading in developing rich peasant economy, it would inevitably lead to what our great leader Chairman Mao has already pointed out: "It would not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, a few dozen years at the most, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party would definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China would definitely change color."

	We warn China's Khrushchev that the foundation of our proletarian dictatorship must not be shaken, and the nature of the party must not be changed. We must resolutely take up the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating the "falling dog," thoroughly criticize and expose the party's top leader who took the capitalist road, overthrow and disgrace him, throw him into the garbage heap of history, and make him stink for eternity, never to rise again. We will forever follow the bright socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao, and forever preserve the socialist mountains and rivers for thousands of years without changing color.

### 不许改变共产党的颜色

    不许改变共产党的颜色	阿城县舍利公社舍利大队　马才
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”我们的党纲还明确规定“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队”，目的是在中国
  “彻底消灭剥削制度”，“实现共产主义”。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却大肆叫嚷
  “东北有一万富农党员也不怕”，甚至无耻地要党员带头雇工，带头剥削。他的目的，就是要改变我们党的性质，使无产阶级的政党，变成资产阶级的政党，实现他在中国复辟资本主义的狼子野心。
    在这种反革命谬论的毒害下，我们大队有少数贫农出身的党员，曾一度走上了资本主义道路。我队有个贫农是土改时的积极分子，是一九四八年公开建党时第一批入党的党员，工作积极肯干。可是，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的党员要带头雇工、带头剥削、允许单干等谬论的毒害下，他逐渐演变了。在伟大的社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命中，这个走错了路的同志受到毛泽东思想的教育，重新回到了毛主席革命路线上来，大杀了中国赫鲁晓夫的回马枪。他激动地控诉说：
  “错误在我身上，根子在中国的赫鲁晓夫那里。若继续按中国赫鲁晓夫发展富农党员的路线干下去，我就成了富农、地主。这次是毛主席第二次解放了我，我要永远跟毛主席走社会主义道路！”今年春天，他主动地交出了过杠的园田地、小开荒，积极参加集体生产劳动。
    如果真的按中国赫鲁晓夫说的那样，党员带头雇工、带头剥削、带头发展富农经济，就势必会出现象我们伟大领袖毛主席早已指出的那样：“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    警告中国的赫鲁晓夫，我们无产阶级专政的基础决不允许动摇，党的性质决不允许改变。我们要坚决奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，批倒批臭，抛进历史的垃圾堆，叫他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。我们要永远沿着毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道奋勇前进，永保社会主义江山千秋万代不变色。
