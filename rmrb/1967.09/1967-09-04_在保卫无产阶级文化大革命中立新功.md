	In defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must achieve new merits. This is the resolute call from the Central Committee of the Party. We, the revolutionary factions of the air force leadership, firmly support and will unhesitatingly carry out this call.

	The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is excellent. However, "we must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the desperate counter-revolutionary plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs." We must closely watch for any attempts by domestic and foreign class enemies to sow discord and fish in troubled waters, and thoroughly smash any attacks by the class enemies. We completely support the wise decision to resolutely disband the counter-revolutionary organization "May 16 Corps" controlled by a small handful of bad leaders. Anyone who dares to oppose Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will firmly overthrow them.

	Over the past few months, we have resolutely joined our comrades from the army and navy revolutionary factions, closely following the great strategist's deployment, concentrating our firepower and targets, deeply carrying out the great criticism, aiming directly at the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, launching a fierce attack on them, and further criticizing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically to overthrow, expose, and criticize them thoroughly. We have also combined this with carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our own units.

	We have extensively and deeply carried out activities to support the people. With the most reverent hearts, we respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people," and we are determined to raise high the great banner of "support the army and love the people" and vow to be models of loving the people. Recently, the air force leadership, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on carrying out the "support the army and love the people" movement, has formulated a people-loving pact.

	We must resolutely support and defend the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, resolutely support and defend the Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and resolutely support and defend all revolutionary masses. They are the backbone of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the vanguard in opposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Without them, we cannot achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution. We will forever be heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with them, sharing the same fate and breathing the same air, uniting together, fighting together, and winning together.

	The local revolutionary factions of the proletariat have established great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must humbly learn from them, regard them as our teachers, and learn all their good experiences.

	We, the People's Liberation Army, will most resolutely carry out the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote preparedness for war," firmly guard our posts, stand in battle array, and be ready at any time to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," giving the daring invaders the most resolute and heavy blows, and achieving new merits in defending national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　在保卫无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
　　空军领导机关无产阶级革命派
    党中央负责同志九月一日在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上的重要讲话，完全正确，非常及时，说出了我们的心里话。这是党中央对我们发出的最新的战斗动员令。我们空军领导机关无产阶级革命派，坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很。但是，“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。我们要密切注视国内外阶级敌人挑拨离间、混水摸鱼的阴谋，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的任何进攻。我们完全拥护关于坚决取缔被一小撮坏头头操纵的反革命组织“五·一六兵团”的英明决定。谁敢反对毛主席，反对党中央，反对中央文革小组，我们就坚决打倒谁。
    几个月来，我们坚决和陆、海军无产阶级革命派战友一起，紧跟伟大统帅的战略部署，集中火力，集中目标，深入地开展了革命的大批判，对准以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部猛烈开火，正在进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭批透，并且结合搞好本单位的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们广泛地、深入地开展了爱民活动。我们以最崇敬的心情响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，决心更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，誓作爱民模范。我们空军领导机关最近遵照中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组关于开展“拥军爱民”运动的指示，制订了爱民公约。
    我们一定要坚决支持和保卫无产阶级革命派，坚决支持和保卫红卫兵革命小将，坚决支持和保卫一切革命群众。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的中坚力量，是反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的先锋。没有他们，便不能取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。我们永远和他们心连心，肩并肩，同命运，共呼吸，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    地方无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了伟大功勋，我们要虚心地向他们学习，拜他们为师，把他们的一切好经验都学到手。
    我们人民解放军最坚决地贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促战备”的伟大号召，坚守岗位，严阵以待，随时准备“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”，给敢于入侵的敌人以最坚决最沉重的打击，为保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
