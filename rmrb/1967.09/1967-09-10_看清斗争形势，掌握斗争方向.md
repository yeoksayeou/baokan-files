At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in a great situation, and when hundreds of millions of people are launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism, the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" is another heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev clique, and a great encouragement to us proletarian revolutionaries. We must expose and thoroughly criticize Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary face of being "left" in form but right in essence.

Over the past year, through the practice of the Cultural Revolution, we have come to realize that to thoroughly purge the poison spread by Tao Zhu, especially his "left" in form but right in essence poison, we proletarian revolutionaries must learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and always be on guard against petty-bourgeois thinking and vacillation within the revolutionary ranks.

Petty-bourgeois thinking belongs to the category of bourgeois thinking. Its existence will also make us deviate from the direction of the struggle to varying degrees. As Comrade Yao Wenyuan said in his article: "The left makes mistakes, the right takes advantage, it has always been like this." With petty-bourgeois thinking, it is easy to put "I" at the center of everything, placing the interests of one's own small group above those of other brother organizations and even the entire revolutionary cause. Other people's opinions are not listened to, and one's own opinions are imposed on others. When encountering problems, there is no self-criticism, only blame on the other side. This will inevitably disperse the fighting strength within the revolutionary ranks and affect the direction of the struggle.

With petty-bourgeois thinking, one cannot correctly use the method of class analysis to distinguish between the two headquarters and two different kinds of contradictions. One may not fully understand the significance of politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrowing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, making the great criticism weak and powerless.

With petty-bourgeois thinking, one often makes various wrong judgments about the revolutionary situation. For example, some people think that the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution are merely the result of "reform"; some people even think that only "chaos again" is a thorough "revolution," and label those who do not agree with this view as "half-revolutionaries" and "new conservatives." Some people even set up their own factions and act independently across industries. This will inevitably affect the direction of the struggle.

People with petty-bourgeois thinking are also prone to replace the Party's policies with their own feelings. For example, some people think that being "left" is just a minor flaw, not a big deal; being right is a serious mistake, unacceptable. Therefore, they do not fully implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy and cadre line, the policy of educating, winning over, and uniting the deceived masses, and even Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people."

We believe that the harm of this petty-bourgeois thinking and its vacillation to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not to be underestimated. Tao Zhu's actions clearly show that there is no insurmountable gap between "left" and right; they are connected. Whether it is right or "left," it can only be beneficial to the bourgeois headquarters and detrimental to the proletarian headquarters. Only by overcoming various petty-bourgeois thoughts within our ranks can the proletarian revolutionaries follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

In the past, the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction of our Transportation Department has been guided by this understanding, eliminating various influences at all times, and following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. No matter when, no matter what issue, as long as we discover some abnormal signs, the core members of our leadership sit down, study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, engage in self-criticism from both sides, and unify everyone's thinking with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, our past work has achieved some results. Now the entire transportation system has achieved revolutionary great unity, and many grassroots units have also achieved revolutionary "three-in-one combination." A mass movement to expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit is being carried out on an unprecedented scale. At the same time, many grassroots units have united a large number of deceived masses, liberated a large number of revolutionary cadres, and established "military support agreements," elevating military-civilian relations to a new level.

However, what we have done is far from enough. The influence of petty-bourgeois thinking among our leading members still exists. At the same time, we are also aware that the class enemy will continue to play tricks and spread poison, using the petty-bourgeois thinking that still exists in everyone's mind to disrupt the direction of the struggle and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works in the future, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, on the one hand, be vigilant against the tricks of Tao Zhu-like figures, and on the other hand, be vigilant against the infiltration of petty-bourgeois thinking at all times. This way, we can better follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out the great criticism thoroughly, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

　　看清斗争形势，掌握斗争方向
　　青海省交通厅系统“八·一八”革命造反派联合委员会
    在无产阶级文化大革命处于一派大好形势之下，在亿万人民开展革命大批判的高潮中，发表姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》这篇文章，这是对中国赫鲁晓夫一伙的又一次沉重打击，是对我们无产阶级革命派的巨大鼓舞。我们必须把陶铸的形“左”实右的反革命嘴脸揭露出来，批深批透。
    一年多来，在文化大革命的实践中我们体会到，要彻底肃清陶铸所散布的流毒，特别是他那套形“左”实右的流毒，我们无产阶级革命派应该通过活学活用毛主席著作，随时注意克服革命队伍内部的小资产阶级思想和摇摆性。
    小资产阶级思想，是属于资产阶级的思想范畴。它的存在同样会使我们在不同程度上背离斗争大方向。正象姚文元同志在他文章中所说的：“左派犯错误，右派利用，历来如此。”有了小资产阶级思想，就容易处处以“我”为中心，把自己小团体的利益放在其他兄弟组织甚至整个革命利益之上。别人的意见听不进去，自己的意见要强加于人。遇事不作自我批评，一味指责对方。这样，势必会涣散革命派内部的战斗力，影响斗争大方向。
    有了小资产阶级思想，就不能正确地运用阶级分析方法，区分两个司令部、两种不同性质的矛盾。就有可能对于从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的意义认识不足，使大批判搞得软弱无力。
    有了小资产阶级思想，对于革命形势总是作出种种错误的估计。例如有的人，对于文化大革命的伟大成果，也认为只是“改良”的结果；有人甚至认为只有“重新大乱”，才是彻底的“革命”，而把不同意这种看法的人说成是“半截子”革命，是新“保字号”。有的人甚至因此而另立门户，跨行业自成体统。这也势必会影响斗争的大方向。
    有小资产阶级思想的人，还容易以感想代替党的政策。比如，有人就认为“左”了只是缺点，不要紧；右了是大错误，不得了。因而对于毛主席的干部路线和干部政策，对于教育、争取和团结受蒙蔽的群众的政策，甚至对于毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，就贯彻执行得不够有力。
    我们认为，这种小资产阶级思想和它的摇摆性，对于无产阶级文化大革命的危害是不容忽视的。陶铸的所作所为，清楚地说明“左”和右之间并没有什么不可逾越的鸿沟，它们是一脉相通的。不管是右还是“左”，都只能是有利于资产阶级司令部，不利于无产阶级司令部。无产阶级革命派只有克服自己队伍中各种小资产阶级思想，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    过去我们交通厅系统的“八·一八”无产阶级革命派正是本着这样的认识，随时排除各种影响，而紧跟毛主席的战略部署的。不管什么时候，不管在什么问题上，只要我们开始发现一些不正常的苗头，我们的领导核心成员就坐下来，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，由双方多作自我批评，用毛泽东思想统一大家的思想认识，因而使我们过去的工作取得了一些成绩。现在整个交通系统已经实现了革命的大联合，许多基层单位还实现了革命的“三结合”。一个群众性的从政治上、思想上、理论上揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位的代理人的运动，正在空前规模地开展起来。与此同时，许多基层单位已经团结了大批受蒙蔽的群众，解放了大批革命干部，订立了“拥军公约”，把军民关系提高到了一个新的阶段。
    但是，我们作的还非常不够，我们领导成员中的小资产阶级思想影响仍然存在。同时，我们也深知阶级敌人还会继续耍阴谋，放暗毒，利用我们每个人头脑中仍然存在着的小资产阶级思想，扰乱斗争大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。因此，我们今后一定要更加努力学习毛主席著作，根据毛主席的教导，一方面警惕陶铸式人物的阴谋，一方面随时警惕小资产阶级思想的侵袭，以便使我们能够更好地紧跟毛主席的战略部署，掌握斗争大方向，把大批判搞深搞透，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
