Sun De-sheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, said at an emergency meeting of this front held on September 7 that the people of North and South Vietnam are currently facing an unprecedentedly arduous and fierce period of struggle, but also a period of unprecedented great and glorious victories. All compatriots and soldiers in the country must carry forward the tradition of unity, overcome all difficulties, with the momentum of victors, resolutely advance bravely, liberate the South, defend the North, and then achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This will contribute to the building of a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

Sun De-sheng, on behalf of the 17 million people in the North, expressed his resolute support for the political program recently adopted by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and his determination to fight side by side with the 14 million people in the South to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, including Le Duan, as well as representatives from various parties, organizations, and ethnic groups, attended the meeting.

Nguyen Van Tien, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the North, was invited to attend the meeting.

Sun De-sheng said in his speech that the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam inherits the ten-point program of the National Liberation Front. It is the banner of great national unity and the banner of decisive victory for the heroic 14 million compatriots in the South. It powerfully expresses the will of the people in the South to defeat the American aggressors and to push the cause of liberating the South to complete victory.

Sun De-sheng said that the people in the North firmly believe that the political program of the National Liberation Front will certainly be realized, and they are determined to contribute to its realization together with the people in the South.

Nguyen Van Tien, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the North, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will become the guiding principle for all revolutionary actions of the 14 million people in the South. It will mobilize and inspire the people in the South to continue to promote the sacred struggle until there is no trace of American aggressors on the beloved land of South Vietnam. This is the ironclad pledge of the 14 million compatriots in the South to fulfill their duty to the front line. At the same time, the political program will also inspire the 17 million people in the North to fulfill their duty to their flesh-and-blood compatriots in the South.

Nguyen Van Tien said that for the independence and freedom of the motherland, the entire nation is determined to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their traitorous clique.

Eighteen representatives from various parties, organizations, and religions also spoke at the meeting, expressing their warm welcome and thorough support for the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Le Duan finally called on the military and people in the North to strive to carry out production and combat competitions, and to support the political program of the National Liberation Front with practical actions.

    孙德胜在讲话中说，越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领继承了民族解放阵线的十点纲领，它是民族大团结的旗帜，是英雄的一千四百万南方同胞的决战决胜的旗帜。它强有力地表达了南方人民决心战胜美国侵略强盗和把解放南方的事业推进到彻底胜利的意志。
