	Strive for Revolution, Promote Production
	Increase Coal Output, Achieve New Merits
	All Mines in Jingxing Bureau Exceed Production Plans Month After Month

	According to a report, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Jingxing Mining Bureau in Hebei Province has been earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." By the end of August, they achieved the glorious success of exceeding the coal production plan month after month and mine after mine across the entire bureau. The total coal output completed 106% of the state plan, an increase of 2.7% compared to the same period last year.

	Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this bureau, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, has launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They consistently follow Chairman Mao's teachings, placing revolution first and using revolution to promote production. During the movement, they firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, always directing their efforts against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, initiating a deep and widespread wave of exposure, criticism, and struggle. They insisted on carrying out the revolution during their spare time, never using production time. In this way, they repeatedly foiled the schemes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who were inciting workers to fight each other, stirring up workers to leave their production posts, and disrupting labor discipline. They united the broad masses of workers, helped erroneous cadres return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieved the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions across the entire bureau.

	Niu Xintai Coal Mine Insists on Revolution During Spare Time

	According to a report, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Niu Xintai Coal Mine in the Benxi Mining Bureau has, while doing a good job of revolution, vigorously promoted production. From January to August, the coal output completed 108% of the state plan, the tunneling advance completed 106% of the state plan, and the overall efficiency reached the highest level since liberation. The consumption of pit props was lower than in any year since liberation.

	This is the result of the revolutionary workers of this mine strictly implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." Since Chairman Mao issued this call to the nation, the revolutionary workers of Niu Xintai Mine have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly guarded their production posts and used their spare time to carry out the revolution. For differing opinions among the masses, they have, under the premise of grasping the direction of the struggle, sincerely consulted and united more than 90% of the workers, achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the mine. Revolutionary workers always have revolution and production in mind. Once, several revolutionary mass organizations held a meeting together, and as the time to go to work approached, the meeting did not disperse. Many veteran workers immediately raised objections: "People cannot go without food, and industry cannot do without grain. Coal is the grain of industry. We are coal miners and must grasp revolution, promote production, produce more coal to support industrial production, and not affect production in any way."

	They also paid attention to the work of the cadres, daring to use revolutionary leading cadres, and helping erroneous cadres to put down their burdens and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, achieving the liberation of a large area and the severe suppression of a handful.

	"Thrift for revolution" is also the action guideline for all the workers of this mine. In the first eight months of this year, they successfully experimented with nearly 30 innovation projects, mostly using waste materials, striving to spend less or no money. The underground mining team launched an activity to sweep floating coal, and a preparation class swept more than 700 tons of floating coal in one month. The miners on the production frontline actively recovered pit props, using old ones instead of new ones, saving the state 456 cubic meters of pit props from January to August. Currently, all the workers of the mine are welcoming the National Day with a hundredfold enthusiasm and are determined to achieve new victories in revolution and production.

	Huangtupo Mine Establishes a Good Order of Revolutionary Production

	According to a report, from January to August, Huangtupo Coal Mine in Datong, Shanxi Province completed 104% of the coal production plan and independently developed a new ventilation shaft 200 meters deep, which has been officially put into production.

	The broad masses of workers of this mine are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have always directed their struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and have consistently insisted on "going up to the surface to carry out the revolution, going down to the mine to carry out production, carrying out the revolution on the spot, carrying out the revolution during spare time, and carrying out the revolution with thrift." The entire mine has not had anyone go out to link up, has not participated in any armed struggles, and has not used production time for the revolution.

	At the height of the struggle between the two lines, the revolutionary mass organizations of the mine were once divided into two factions. However, they were able to correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, using the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to resolve differences, quickly achieving revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and establishing a normal order of revolution and production. Now, this mine has launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism, combining the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and is preparing to achieve new merits in "grasping revolution, promoting production."

	Xinghuo Mine Overcomes Various Difficulties to Maintain Eight-Hour Production

	According to a report, under the great banner of Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," the proletarian revolutionary faction of Xinghuo Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province completed the annual coal production task four months ahead of schedule.

	By the end of August, this coal mine's coal output completed 105% of the annual plan, an increase of 19.2% compared to the same period last year. Various economic and technical indicators also saw significant improvements.

	The reason Xinghuo Coal Mine was able to achieve this brilliant result is that the proletarian revolutionary faction, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's words in everything, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." They firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, overcame various difficulties, ensured eight hours of labor production, and insisted on carrying out the revolution during spare time. In March of this year, the handful of power-holders within the Party at the mine incited some uninformed masses to disrupt the revolution and production, causing the coal output in mid-March to drop. At this time, the proletarian revolutionary faction bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, exposed the enemy's schemes, mobilized the masses to insist on carrying out the revolution on the spot, during spare time, and with thrift, and finally exceeded the production plan for March.

	Now, the entire mine has launched a high tide of criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The proletarian revolutionary faction is determined to achieve new victories in revolution and production and to turn Xinghuo Coal Mine into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

　　狠抓革命　猛促生产
　　多产原煤　大立新功
　　井陉局各矿月月超额完成生产计划
    本报讯河北井陉矿务局的无产阶级革命派，认真执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，截至八月底止，取得了全局范围内月月、矿矿都超额完成煤炭生产计划的光辉成就。全局原煤产量完成国家计划的百分之一百零六，比去年同期提高百分之二点七。
    自无产阶级文化大革命以来，这个局的无产阶级革命派，在解放军同志的支持和帮助下，开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，时刻遵循毛主席的教导，把革命放在第一位，用革命猛促生产。在运动中，他们紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，掀起了深入的广泛的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮。他们坚持业余时间闹革命，决不占用生产时间。这样，他们一次又一次地粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动群众斗群众、煽动工人离开生产岗位、破坏劳动纪律的阴谋，团结了广大职工，帮助犯错误的干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来，实现了全局范围的无产阶级革命派的大联合。
　　牛心台煤矿坚持业余时间闹革命
    本报讯　本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿无产阶级革命派，在搞好革命的同时，大力促生产。一至八月份，原煤产量完成国家计划百分之一百零八，掘进进尺完成国家计划百分之一百零六，全员效率达到解放以来的最高水平，坑木消耗低于解放以来任何一年。
    这是这个矿上的革命职工，不折不扣地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的结果。自从毛主席向全国发出这一号召以后，牛心台矿的革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，坚守生产岗位，利用业余时间闹革命。对于群众间的不同意见，都能在掌握斗争大方向的前提下，通过真诚的协商，团结百分之九十以上的职工，实现了矿上的无产阶级革命派大联合。革命工人心里时刻有革命，时刻有生产。一次，几个革命群众组织在一起开会，眼看要上班了，还不散会，许多老工人马上提出意见：“人不吃饭不行，工业离开了粮食也不行。煤炭是工业的粮食，我们是煤矿工人，一定要抓革命，促生产，生产更多的煤支援工业生产，决不能丝毫影响生产。”
    他们还注意做干部的工作，大胆使用革命领导干部，帮助犯错误的干部放下包袱，站到毛主席革命路线上来，做到了勇敢解放一大片，狠狠打击一小撮。
    “节约闹革命”，也是这个矿全体职工的行动准则。今年头八个月，他们试验成功近三十项革新项目，大都利用废旧料，力求少花钱或不花钱。井下采煤队开展了扫浮煤的活动，有一个整备班一个月里就扫浮煤七百多吨。战斗在生产第一线的采煤职工，积极回收坑木，以旧代新，一至八月已为国家节省坑木四百五十六立方米。目前，全矿职工以百倍的热情迎接国庆，决心夺取革命、生产的新胜利。
　　黄土坡矿建立良好的革命生产秩序
    本报讯　山西大同黄土坡煤矿，一至八月份完成原煤生产计划百分之一百零四，还自力更生开出一个深达二百米的新风井，已正式投入生产。
    这个矿的广大职工，无限忠于毛主席，最坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，自开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，始终把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并且一直坚持“上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命”。全矿没有人外出串连，没有参加过一次武斗，没有占用生产时间闹革命。
    在两条路线斗争最激烈的时候，矿上的革命群众组织曾分成两派。但是，他们能正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，采用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，解决了分歧，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，建立了正常的革命秩序和生产秩序。现在，这个矿已掀起革命大批判的高潮，结合搞好本单位的斗、批、改，准备在“抓革命，促生产”中立新功。
　　星火矿排除各种困难坚持八小时生产
    本报讯　在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针鼓舞下，陕西省星火煤矿无产阶级革命派提前四个月完成了全年的煤炭生产任务。
    一至八月底，这个煤矿原煤产量完成全年计划的百分之一百零五，比去年同期增长百分之十九点二。各项经济技术指标也有大幅度的提高。
    星火煤矿所以能取得这一辉煌成绩，是由于无产阶级革命派在解放军帮助下活学活用毛主席著作，事事听毛主席的话，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的结果。他们紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，排除各种困难，保证八小时劳动生产，坚持业余时间闹革命。今年三月份，矿上的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，极力煽动一些不明真相的群众破坏革命，破坏生产，一度使三月中旬的煤炭产量降低。这时，无产阶级革命派勇敢挑起革命、生产两副重担，揭露了敌人的阴谋，发动群众坚持就地闹革命、业余时间闹革命、节约闹革命，最后超额完成了三月份的生产任务。
    现在，全矿已掀起一个向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的高潮。无产阶级革命派决心夺取革命、生产的新胜利，把星火煤矿办成一座红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
