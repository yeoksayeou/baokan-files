On the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, led personally by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's people, revolutionary people around the world highly praise Chairman Mao's glorious thoughts on the people's army. Revolutionary parties of the proletariat in some countries have decided to build new-type people's armies according to Chairman Mao's military thoughts and to take the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao, as their example, and to wage people's wars.

Chairman Mao said, "Without an army of the people, there can be no everything of the people." "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a powerful army." Revolutionary people of the world praise these scientific propositions by Chairman Mao as having pointed out a glorious road of victory for the world's revolutionary people.

The Thoughts of Chairman Mao's People's Army Are Universally Applicable

The struggles of the Albanian people fighting on the anti-revisionist front, the Vietnamese people fighting on the front of resistance against American aggression and aid to the nation, and the people of other countries have vividly proved that Chairman Mao's teachings on building a people's army are extremely important and absolutely correct. The first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, De Zhen Ba Deng Ding, pointed out in an article titled "The Armed Struggle of the Burmese People Will Surely Win" that the Burmese Communist Party has built a people's army and waged a people's war according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and therefore the armed struggle of the Burmese people has achieved great victories. The article said, "The history of the armed struggle in Burma is a history of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a history that proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere." The member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the Secretariat of the Ceylon Communist Party, San Mu Jia Da San, wrote in an article titled "The Chinese People's Liberation Army - A Great School of Mao Zedong Thought" that "The experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shows all the people struggling to break free from the shackles of imperialism and capitalism that without armed struggle and a people's army, the people cannot achieve victory." The organ of the Colombian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), "Revolutionary News," published an article emphasizing Mao's theories on building a people's army, the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, and the establishment of rural revolutionary base areas. It said that these are the greatest achievements of the Chinese Revolution and have great significance in guiding the revolutionary struggle in Colombia. The organ of the Revolutionary Youth League of the Congo (Leopoldville), "Lightning," emphasized in an article that the urgent task for Congolese revolutionaries is to truly grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and to establish a Marxist-Leninist party, a people's army under the leadership of this party, and a broad revolutionary united front according to Mao Zedong Thought. The article said, "The three magic weapons pointed out by Chairman Mao are decisive weapons for the Congolese people to win revolutionary victory." The French "New Humanity" pointed out that Mao's three magic weapons "are applicable to the whole world, especially under current conditions."

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Is a Model for the Oppressed People to Learn From

Revolutionary people of the world enthusiastically praise the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and directly commanded by the great helmsman Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as "the model revolutionary army of the world's people" and "the best example for building new-type people's armies in various countries." The editorial of the Albanian "Soldier's News" praised, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new-type proletarian army created, educated, tempered, and led by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong." The editorial of the Vietnamese "People's News" pointed out that it is a great revolutionary army that comes from the people, fights for the people's interests, is closely connected with the people, and enjoys the wholehearted support of the people. "In the revolutionary struggle, the Vietnamese military and people have learned many precious experiences about revolutionary war and people's war from the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army." The responsible person of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and the General Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, established under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is the most revolutionary and powerful army.

Many revolutionaries in Japan pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and cultivated by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "is an unprecedented proletarian army in the history of class struggle, a new-type people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought that serves the people wholeheartedly; it is a completely new-type army that the world has never had before; it is an invincible proletarian army established according to Chairman Mao's military thoughts, unparalleled in the world," and therefore, it "is a brilliant model for the revolutionary people of Japan and the world to learn from." A representative of the Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique also pointed out, "Chairman Mao's great military thoughts on the people's army and people's war are universally applicable to the oppressed people, and the People's Liberation Army is a great model for the oppressed people to learn from."

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Is a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought

Many revolutionaries in various countries enthusiastically acclaim, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought." The Chinese People's Liberation Army has firmly established Mao Zedong Thought and, according to Chairman Mao's great military thoughts, has built "an armed group that executes revolutionary political tasks." The core of Mao Zedong's military thoughts is to emphasize proletarian politics, to build the army politically, to fully value the decisive role of human and political thought factors, and to fully mobilize the initiative of the soldier masses and the people in war.

The Ceylon "Worker's News" published an article saying that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a political force. This army is led and mobilized by a Marxist-Leninist party. This army acts according to the party's political policies. This army has the love, cooperation, and support of the people. Therefore, this army is invincible. Pakistani revolutionaries praised that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasps the "four firsts" and promotes the "three-eighths" style, and thus becomes an invincible force.

Build People's Armed Forces According to Chairman Mao's Military Thoughts

Through their own struggles, the revolutionary people of the world have increasingly deeply felt that to build a powerful people's armed force, only by following Chairman Mao's military thoughts can one achieve results. In an article, the first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, De Zhen Ba Deng Ding, detailed the struggles of the Burmese people in building a people's army and waging a people's war, where Chairman Mao's proletarian military thoughts had fierce struggles with bourgeois military thoughts and achieved victory. He said: According to our experience, Chairman Mao's teaching that "our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the party" is extremely precious. He also pointed out that the Burmese people's army, by grasping the Mao Zedong Thought that in the relationship between people and weapons, the human factor comes first, has developed the people's war vigorously; by strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously, has grasped and executed Chairman Mao's teachings on concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy, and annihilative battles have appeared all over the country. This army also executes the three basic tasks of fighting, mass work, and production, practices political, military, and economic democracy within the army, puts political and ideological work in the first place, and implements the principle of self-reliance. Therefore, the revolution is constantly developing. In Laos, the patriotic armed forces also list armed struggle, mobilizing the masses, and developing production as the three major important tasks and correctly execute the policy of a broad united front. Now, this people's army has gradually grown from weak to strong and, on the basis of self-reliance, is striving to build liberated areas into politically and economically consolidated revolutionary base areas. The representative of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Nuo Ha, pointed out that all these are the results of the Lao people using Chairman Mao's thoughts on the people's army and people's war. The armed forces of many countries, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, especially emphasize the close blood relationship between the people's army and the people. Some leaders of the patriotic armed forces fighting in the forests and mountains of the Congo carry Chairman Mao's military works with them and often explain to the soldiers the "three rules of discipline and eight points for attention" formulated by Chairman Mao. Some guerrilla fighters in Latin America proudly wear copper badges with the "three rules of discipline and eight points for attention" on their chests. The people's armed forces of many countries take the Chinese People's Liberation Army as an example to improve the political quality of the troops, continuously strengthening the troops' combat effectiveness.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's glorious thoughts on the people's army and people's war, armed struggles in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. Revolutionaries of many countries have decided to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and let the fire of the Autumn Harvest Uprising burn throughout the world!

　　各国革命人民在秋收起义四十周年之际盛赞毛主席人民军队的光辉思想
　　建立人民军队　开展人民战争　夺取革命胜利
　　决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，让秋收起义之火燃遍全球
    据新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：在世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义四十周年的时候，世界革命人民高度赞扬毛主席关于人民军队的光辉思想，一些国家无产阶级革命政党决心按照毛主席建军思想和以毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军为榜样建立新型的人民军队，开展人民战争。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”世界革命人民称赞毛主席的这些科学论断为世界革命人民指出了一条光辉的胜利道路。
    毛主席人民军队的思想放之四海而皆准
    战斗在反修前哨的阿尔巴尼亚人民和战斗在抗美救国前线的越南人民以及其他国家人民的斗争实践，都生动地证明了毛主席关于建立一支人民军队的教导是非常重要、绝对正确的。缅共中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶在题为《缅甸人民革命武装斗争必胜》的文章中指出，缅共就是按照毛主席的教导建设人民军队和开展人民战争的，因此缅甸人民的武装斗争取得了伟大胜利。文章说：“缅甸武装斗争的历史，是伟大的毛泽东思想取得胜利的历史，也是证明毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理的历史。”锡共中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑在一篇题为《中国人民解放军——毛泽东思想的大学校》的文章中说：“中国人民解放军的经历向所有为摆脱帝国主义和资本主义的枷锁而斗争的人民表明，没有武装斗争，没有人民的军队，人民是不可能取得胜利的。”哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《革命报》发表文章，着重阐述了毛主席的关于建立人民军队、建立党对军队的绝对领导、以及建立农村革命根据地的理论。它说，这些都是中国革命最伟大的成就。它对指导哥伦比亚革命斗争具有重大意义。刚果（金）革命青年联盟机关刊物《闪电》著文强调，刚果（金）革命者的当务之急是真正地掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，并遵循毛泽东思想建立一个马克思列宁主义政党、一个在这个党领导下的人民军队和一个广泛的革命统一战线。文章说：“毛主席指出的这三件法宝对刚果（金）人民争取革命胜利来说是决定性的武器。”法国《新人道报》指出，毛主席的这三大法宝“适用于全世界，特别是在目前条件下更是这样”。
    中国人民解放军是被压迫人民学习的榜样
    世界革命人民热情称颂由伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的、由林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军是“世界人民模范的革命军队”，是各国人民“建立新型的人民军队的最好榜样”。阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》社论赞扬说：“中国人民解放军是中国共产党和毛泽东同志缔造、教育、锻炼和领导的一支新型的无产阶级的军队”。越南《人民报》的社论指出，这是一支从人民中来，为人民的利益而战斗，同人民血肉相连，得到人民全心全意拥护的伟大的革命军队。“在革命斗争中，越南军民从中国共产党和中国人民解放军学习到许多关于革命战争和人民战争的宝贵经验。”老挝爱国战线党中央和老挝人民解放军最高指挥部负责人指出，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导方针建立起来的中国人民解放军是最革命最强大的军队。
    日本的许多革命者指出，由毛主席亲手缔造和培育、由林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，“是在阶级斗争历史上举世无双的无产阶级的军队，是以毛泽东思想武装起来的全心全意地为人民服务的新型的人民军队”；“是一支世界上从来没有过的完全新型的军队”；“是一支根据毛主席建军思想建立起来的举世无双的无敌于天下的无产阶级军队”，因此，它“是日本和世界各国革命人民学习的光辉榜样”。莫三鼻给革命委员会一位代表也指出：“毛主席关于人民军队和人民战争的伟大的军事思想，对被压迫人民是普遍适用的，人民解放军是被压迫人民学习的伟大榜样。”
    中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想的大学校
    许多国家的革命者热烈地欢呼“中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想的大学校”。中国人民解放军大立毛泽东思想，根据毛主席的伟大的建军思想，建成了“一支执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”。毛泽东军事思想的核心，就是突出无产阶级政治，着重从政治上建军，就是充分重视人的因素、政治思想因素的决定作用，充分发挥士兵群众和人民群众在战争中的能动作用。
    锡兰《劳工报》发表文章说，中国人民解放军是一支政治力量。这支军队是以马克思列宁主义政党领导和动员起来的。这支军队按照党的政治方针办事。这支军队得到了人民的爱护、合作和支援。因此，这支军队无敌于天下。巴基斯坦革命者称颂，中国人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢掌握“四个第一”和大兴“三八作风”，因而成为一支战无不胜的力量。
    按照毛主席建军思想建立人民武装力量
    世界革命人民通过自己的斗争实践，越来越深刻地体会到，要建立一支强大的人民武装力量，只有按照毛主席的建军思想才能取得成效。缅共中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶在一篇文章中详细地谈到了缅甸人民在建设人民军队和开展人民战争的问题上，毛主席的无产阶级军事思想同资产阶级军事思想进行了激烈的斗争，并且取得了胜利。他说：根据我们的经验，毛主席关于“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”的教导，是极其宝贵的。他还指出，缅甸人民军由于掌握了在人与武器的关系上，人的因素第一这一毛泽东思想，人民战争蓬勃发展起来了；由于战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人，掌握和执行了毛主席的关于集中优势兵力歼灭敌人的教导，在全国出现了歼灭性的战斗。这支军队还执行了战斗、群众工作和生产三项基本任务，在军内实行政治、军事和经济民主，把政治思想工作放在第一位，并且贯彻了以自力更生为主的原则。因此革命不断发展。在老挝，爱国武装力量也是把武装斗争、动员群众、发展生产列为三大重要任务，并且正确地执行了广泛的统一战线政策。现在，这支人民军队已逐步由弱变强，在自力更生的基础上，努力建设解放区，把它建成为在政治、经济上巩固的革命根据地。老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈指出，所有这些，都是由于老挝人民运用了毛主席关于人民军队、人民战争思想的结果。不少国家的人民武装力量根据毛主席的教导，特别重视密切人民军队同人民群众的血肉关系。战斗在森林和山区的刚果（金）爱国武装力量的一些领导干部，随身带着毛主席的军事著作，他们经常给战士们讲解毛主席所制订的“三大纪律、八项注意”。拉丁美洲一些游击战士还自豪地在胸前佩戴刻着“三大纪律、八项注意”的铜章。许多国家的人民武装都以中国人民解放军为榜样来提高部队的政治素质，使部队的战斗力不断得到加强。
    在毛主席关于人民军队、人民战争的光辉思想照耀下，亚非拉广大地区的武装斗争正在蓬勃发展，许多国家的革命者都决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，让秋收起义之火燃遍全球！
