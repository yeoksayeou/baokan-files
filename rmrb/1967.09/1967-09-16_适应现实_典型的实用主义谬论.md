Like all old and new revisionists, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Communist Party are typical brokers of bourgeois utilitarianism.

Utilitarianism is the most reactionary bourgeois philosophy of the imperialist era, born in the United States. It denies the objective laws of development, denies objective truth, and denies the class nature of truth. Its fundamental tenet is: "What is useful is truth." Therefore, it is a form of subjective idealism. Based on this reactionary view of truth, it declares the system of exploitation and oppression of monopoly capitalism, the policy of aggression and war of imperialism, to be "truth." Hence, it is elevated to the status of "national philosophy" by the American monopoly bourgeoisie. This philosophy is also regarded as a treasure by old and new revisionists, becoming their theoretical tool for promoting opportunism and capitulationism in the international communist movement and restoring capitalism in socialist countries.

During the May Fourth Movement, the cultural comprador and running dog of imperialism, Hu Shi, brought utilitarianism to China, serving the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the party faithfully inherited Hu Shi's utilitarian legacy, using it to serve his bourgeois reactionary line. As early as 1939, when he first published "Self-Cultivation," he shamelessly spread the poison of utilitarianism.

In his brilliant work "On Practice" written in 1937, Chairman Mao taught us: "The task of correctly recognizing and transforming the world has fallen historically on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party.... This means completely overthrowing the dark side of the world and China, transforming them into an unprecedentedly bright world." The "transformation of the world" that Chairman Mao spoke of means completely overthrowing the old world and establishing a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without a system of exploitation. Two years later, "Self-Cultivation" came out, openly distorting, falsifying, and opposing Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on transforming the world, turning "transforming the world" into "adapting to reality, recognizing reality, and seeking survival and development within reality."

"Adapting to reality," "seeking survival and development within reality," are typical utilitarian slogans, completely in tune with the utilitarian master Charles Sanders Peirce's advocacy of "the only standard of truth is what best adapts to life" and the big comprador Hu Shi's advocacy of "truth is merely a tool to deal with the environment."

Bourgeois utilitarians advocate "adapting to life" to maintain the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie, making people adapt to the bourgeois order, bow their heads, and become slaves of capitalism, and get a few crumbs from the bourgeoisie. The author of "Self-Cultivation" advocates "adapting to reality" to prevent the proletariat from rebelling, to prevent the proletariat from using violence to overthrow the old world. The purpose is the same: to maintain the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie and to seek their own survival.

To "adapt to reality" and "seek survival and development within reality," in 1922, when he went to Anshan to "lead" the workers' movement, he repeatedly emphasized that workers must "maintain order," "be content with their lot," and ordered workers to "obey" the rules of the mine authorities, "strive to maintain" mine production, and "not to frequently gather and make noise to coerce, and not to frequently strike to disrupt work." He helped imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie, attempting to suppress the roaring workers' movement.

To "adapt to reality" and "seek survival and development within reality," on the eve of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously promoted the philosophy of survival and the philosophy of traitors, under the pretext of "lack of cadres in the white areas," ordering some captured "Communist Party members" to write anti-Communist statements, surrender, and betray the class enemy. After these traitors were released from prison, he promoted and used them extensively, making them the backbone of his conspiracy to seize the party.

To "adapt to reality" and "seek survival and development within reality," during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously promoted Wang Ming's rightist capitulationist line, treating the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang as "revolutionary flags," advocating "everything through the united front, everything subordinate to the united front," and wanting our party-led anti-Japanese army to "be led by the Central Military Commission of the National Government." He openly opposed Chairman Mao's principle of independence within the united front, attempting to hand over our party's leadership of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the Kuomintang reactionaries.

To "adapt to reality" and "seek survival and development within reality," after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he openly advocated the "parliamentary road," wanting our party to hand over the army to the Kuomintang and go to the Kuomintang reactionary government to "be officials"; he even said: "The Americans must find a comprador in China, we can also be compradors, red compradors!" This is to sell off the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance, completely surrendering to the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek.

To "adapt to reality" and "seek survival and development within reality," during the three years of difficulty, when imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries abroad were rampant in their anti-China activities, and class enemies at home were stirring, he proposed the revisionist line of "three autonomies and one contract" and "three harmonies and one reduction"....

And so on, the list goes on. His so-called "adapting to reality" and "seeking survival and development within reality" is to oppose the proletarian violent revolution, to oppose socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is to surrender, betray, sell out, disarm, and capitulate!

To defend the capitalist system of exploitation, the bourgeois utilitarians created a "theory": "Truth is originally man-made, made for man, made by man for man to use." Based on this extremely reactionary fallacy, they declare that the bourgeois oppression and exploitation of the proletariat is "truth." The main representative of utilitarianism, Dewey, even claimed that the imperialist system should "enjoy the greatest respect in all human institutions." After national liberation, the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, to oppose the socialist revolution, to plot to strangle the newly born dictatorship of the proletariat, the People's Republic of China, and to drag our country back to the old capitalist road, he again took out these reactionary fallacies of utilitarianism to peddle extensively.

Chairman Mao pointed out, "Only socialism can save China." This is the objective law of the development of our society, the scientific truth of the proletarian revolution. The biggest capitalist-roader within the party, however, preached to the capitalists about how "today, capitalism in China is progressive," "today, capitalist exploitation is not only not evil but also has merit," "the broader the scope of exploitation, the more workers are exploited, the greater the merit," "now everyone wants you to exploit. These issues are not deliberately said by us, because this is the truth, the truth must be propagated." His fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is truth" is a blatant peddling of bourgeois utilitarianism, a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. His shameless words are, as Marx pointed out when criticizing the bourgeois lackeys, nothing more than the barking of the "anointed watchdogs" of the bourgeoisie.

Bourgeois utilitarianism is the "official philosophy of the American way of life." It openly advocates: "We must seek truth because we must all do profitable things." "Truth mostly exists in a credit system, we trade in truth with each other." Truth is just a "cash value."

The Chinese Khrushchev also peddled this philosophy reeking of copper coins, wanting people to "cultivate themselves" according to this. Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people completely, selflessly, to be "a person of high moral character, a pure person, a person with virtue, a person free from vulgar interests, a person beneficial to the people." The Chinese Khrushchev, however, said: "Suffer a small loss, gain a big advantage, this is in line with the Marxist-Leninist worldview." He obliquely advocates the bourgeois individualist philosophy of life, wanting to corrupt and poison our party members, cadres, and youth, wanting people to "cultivate" and "do profitable things" according to the specifications of speculators, to hunt for "cash value," and thus degenerate into revisionists.

In criticizing the old revisionists, Lenin pointed out: "Temporary expedients, yielding to the circumstances of the moment.... sacrificing the fundamental interests of the proletariat for the sake of actual or imagined temporary interests—this is the policy of revisionism." Lenin's comment outlines the ugly face of old revisionists practicing bourgeois utilitarianism. The Chinese Khrushchev is even worse than the old revisionists. He openly took the notorious utilitarian slogan of "adapting to reality" and "seeking survival and development within reality" as the basic principle of "self-cultivation." For decades, he has done nothing but oppose the proletarian revolution, betray the interests of the proletariat, and betray the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must thoroughly criticize him politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrow and expose him, and completely eliminate the poison of his counter-revolutionary revisionist line and his bourgeois utilitarian reactionary worldview.

    “适应现实”——典型的实用主义谬论中共		中央华北局“红联”宣传部井冈山纵队
    同一切新老修正主义者一样，中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是一个典型的贩卖资产阶级实用主义的政治掮客。
    实用主义是帝国主义时代在美国产生的一种最反动的资产阶级哲学。它否认事物发展的客观规律，否认客观真理，否认真理的阶级性。它的基本信条是：“有用就是真理”。所以它是一种主观唯心论。根据这种反动的真理观，它把垄断资本主义的剥削和压迫制度，把帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，通通宣布为“真理”，因而它被美国垄断资产阶级推崇到“国家哲学”的地位。这种哲学，也被新老修正主义者奉为至宝，成为他们在国际共产主义运动中推行机会主义、投降主义路线，在社会主义国家中复辟资本主义的理论工具。
    在五四运动前后，文化买办、洋奴才胡适把实用主义贩运到中国，为帝国主义及其走狗官僚买办资产阶级的反动统治服务。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，忠实地继承了胡适的实用主义的衣钵，为他推行资产阶级反动路线服务。早在一九三九年，他第一次抛出《修养》的时候，就肆无忌惮地散布实用主义的毒素。
    毛主席一九三七年写的光辉著作《实践论》一文教导我们：“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。……这就是整个儿地推翻世界和中国的黑暗面，把它们转变过来成为前所未有的光明世界。”毛主席所说的改造世界，就是要整个儿地推翻旧世界，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。两年之后出笼的《修养》，却公然歪曲、篡改和反对毛主席关于改造世界的光辉思想，把“改造世界”说成是要我们去“适应现实，认识现实，在现实中求得生存发展”。
    “适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，这是典型的实用主义的格言，同实用主义的祖师爷皮尔士所鼓吹的“真理的唯一标准，就是看哪个最能适应生活”，同大买办胡适所鼓吹的“真理不过是对付环境的一种工具”，完全是一个腔调。
    资产阶级实用主义者鼓吹“适应生活”，是为了维护资产阶级的反动统治，让人们适应资产阶级的统治秩序，俯首帖耳地充当资本主义的奴隶，并从资产阶级那里分得一碗残羹剩饭。《修养》的作者鼓吹“适应现实”，是不准无产阶级造反，不准无产阶级用暴力推翻旧世界，其目的同样是为了维护资产阶级的反动统治，并求得自己的苟且偷生。
    为了“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，他在一九二二年到安源“领导”工人运动时，就一再强调工人要“严守秩序”，“安分守己”，勒令工人“遵守”路矿当局的“规则”，“竭力维持”矿局生产，“不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟，并不得动辄罢工妨碍工作”。帮助帝国主义和买办资产阶级，企图把轰轰烈烈的工人运动打下去。
    为了“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，他在抗日战争爆发前夕，大肆鼓吹活命哲学、叛徒哲学，借口“白区干部很缺乏”，要“保存革命的力量”，指使某些被捕的“共产党员”写反共启事，自首变节，投降阶级敌人。这批叛徒出狱后，他大加提拔重用，成为他阴谋篡党的骨干力量。
    为了“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，他在抗日战争时期，竭力推行王明的右倾投降主义路线，把人民公敌蒋介石、国民党奉为“革命的旗帜”，鼓吹“一切经过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”，要我们党领导的抗日军队去“受国民政府中央军事委员会的领导”。他公然反对毛主席关于统一战线中独立自主的原则，妄图把我们党对抗日战争的领导权拱手交给国民党反动派。
    为了“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，他在抗日战争胜利后，又公开鼓吹“议会道路”，要我们党把军队交给国民党，到国民党反动政府里去“做官”；还说什么：“美国非要在中国找买办不可，我们也可以给他当买办，红色买办嘛！”这是要将抗战胜利的革命果实进行大拍卖，向美帝及其走狗蒋介石彻底投降。
    为了“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，在三年困难时期，在国外帝、修、反猖狂反华，国内阶级敌人蠢蠢欲动的情况下，他提出了“三自一包”“三和一少”的修正主义路线。……
    如此等等，不一而足。他所谓的“适应现实”，“在现实中求得生存发展”，就是反对无产阶级暴力革命，反对社会主义和无产阶级专政，就是自首、变节、叛变、出卖、缴枪、投降！
    资产阶级实用主义者为了替资本主义剥削制度辩护，制造了一条“理论”，叫做：“真理原来是人造的，是为了人造的，是人造出来供人用的”。根据这个极端反动的谬论，他们宣称资产阶级压迫剥削无产阶级是“真理”。实用主义的主要代表人杜威甚至声称，帝国主义制度应“在所有人类制度中享有社会的最大的尊敬”。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在全国解放后，为了反对社会主义革命，阴谋扼杀刚刚诞生的无产阶级专政的中华人民共和国，把我国拖回到资本主义的老路上去，又把实用主义这些反动谬论拿来大肆推销。
    毛主席指出，“只有社会主义能够救中国”。这是我国社会发展的客观规律，是无产阶级革命的科学真理。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却对着资本家大肆宣扬什么“今天资本主义在中国是进步的”，“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”，“剥削范围愈广，剥削工人愈多，功劳愈大”，“现在大家要请你剥削。这些问题不是我们故意这样讲，因为这是真理，真理就要宣传。”他的这种“剥削有功”、“剥削是真理”的谬论，是他露骨地贩卖资产阶级实用主义，彻底地背叛马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一个突出表现。他的这种无耻谰言，正象马克思批判资产阶级御用学者时所指出的，不过是资产阶级豢养的“涂了圣油的警犬”的狂吠。
    资产阶级实用主义是“美国生活方式的官方哲学”。它赤裸裸地宣扬：“我们所以必须寻求真理，是因为我们都必须做合算的事”。“真理大半存在于一种信贷系统上，我们彼此在真理上做买卖。”真理只是一种“兑现价值”。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫把这种铜臭熏天的市侩哲学也拿来贩卖，要人们照此进行“自我修养”。毛主席教导我们，要完全、彻底地为人民服务，要毫不利己专门利人，要做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。中国的赫鲁晓夫却说什么：“吃点小亏，占个大便宜，这是符合马列主义世界观的。”他拐弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义的处世哲学，就是要腐蚀、毒害我们的党员、干部和青年，要人们按照投机商的规格去“修养”，去“做合算的事”，去猎取“兑现价值”，从而蜕变成为修正主义者。
    列宁在批判老修正主义者时指出：“临时应付，迁就眼前的事变，……为谋取实际的或可以设想的一时的利益而牺牲无产阶级的根本利益，——这就是修正主义的政策。”列宁的这个评语，勾划出了老修正主义者奉行资产阶级实用主义的丑恶嘴脸。中国的赫鲁晓夫比老修正主义者有过之而无不及，他公开把“适应现实”、“在现实中求得生存发展”这个臭名昭著的实用主义信条，作为“修养”的基本准则，数十年来，干尽了反对无产阶级革命，出卖无产阶级利益，背叛无产阶级专政的勾当。我们必须把他从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底清除他的反革命修正主义路线及其资产阶级实用主义反动世界观的流毒。
