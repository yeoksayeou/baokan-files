The great People's Liberation Army is a steel wall defending our motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our heroic air force has shot down a U.S. imperialist unmanned reconnaissance plane.

The Central Military Commission issued a commendation order, stating that this battle victory is the result of the participating units holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is hoped that the participating units will remain vigilant, strengthen preparedness, and achieve new victories in defending the country and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: This noon, a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance plane intruded into the airspace over a certain area in Guangxi to conduct reconnaissance and provocation. It was immediately shot down by our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force units. This is the tenth U.S. bandit plane shot down by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, since April this year.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The Central Military Commission today issued a commendation order, praising the certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force for shooting down a U.S. imperialist military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance plane over a certain area in Guangxi today.

The commendation order states: This is another punishment for the U.S. imperialist air pirates invading our country to cause destruction and trouble. It is a new encouragement for our country's revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses. It is the actual action of the participating units to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The commendation order points out: This battle victory is the result of the participating units holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness and support the army and love the people. It is the result of your insistence on being prepared at all times and fighting a battle of annihilation bravely and wisely.

The commendation order states: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our national defense will be consolidated, and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again." At present, our country is at a critical moment of a great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Domestic and foreign class enemies will still engage in various forms of sabotage and disruption. Therefore, it is hoped that you will remain vigilant, strengthen preparedness, and achieve new victories in defending the country and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
