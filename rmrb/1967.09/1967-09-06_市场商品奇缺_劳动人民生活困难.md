According to Soviet publications, there is a severe shortage of goods in various parts of the Soviet Union, and many daily necessities are often in short supply. Meat and fruits have become "luxury items." The lives of the working people are becoming increasingly difficult.

In Moscow's Store No. 84, there are no apples, lemons, or oranges, and even carrots are unavailable.

The situation in Store No. 83 is the same. If someone wants to buy oranges, apples, or carrots, they are bound to be disappointed. Even sauerkraut is out of stock; every half hour, about twenty customers ask if there is any sauerkraut. The salesperson always responds, "None," "None." However, the display window still features pickled cucumbers.

In the city of Talsi in the Latvian Republic, matches have been out of stock for over three months. Not only are matches scarce, but electric irons, floor lamps, and blankets are also rarely seen on the shelves. Even "Little Bear" brand candies are hard to find.

Stores place orders for these items every month, specifying large quantities needed. However, the results always fall far short of meeting the demand. The trading base always says: "Not enough goods."

In the first quarter of this year, the Talsi city consumer cooperative union received only 620 boxes of matches. Additionally, not all stores, and certainly not at any random time, sell matches. Even when they do, it is rationed.

In some regions of the Azerbaijan Republic, rural stores lack sufficient quantities of student uniforms, dresses, and cotton pants. Overcoats and jackets are only available for very tall men, but there are none for young students.

The supply of shoes in rural commercial networks is insufficient, and children's leather shoes are scarce.

Rural cultural supplies and household items are also in short supply. Even switches, sockets, electric irons, and small electric stoves are not enough to go around. Even light bulbs are hard to come by.

### 市场商品奇缺　劳动人民生活困难

　　市场商品奇缺　劳动人民生活困难
    据苏联报刊透露，苏联各地商品奇缺，许多日常生活用品经常供不应求。至于肉类和水果，则已经成为“贵重商品”了。劳动人民生活越来越困苦。
    在莫斯科第八十四号商店，不但没有苹果、柠檬和桔子，而且连胡萝卜也没有。
    第八十三号商店情况也一样。有人要是想买桔子、苹果或者胡萝卜，就得非碰钉子不可。这里连酸白菜都缺货，每半小时就有二十来位顾客问有没有酸白菜。售货员总是习惯地回答：“没有”，“没有”。然而在橱窗里却还点缀着腌黄瓜。
    在拉脱维亚共和国的塔尔塞城，火柴已脱销三个多月了。不光火柴少，柜台上也很少看到电熨斗、落地大灯、毛毯。甚至连“小熊牌”的糖也很少见。
    商店每月都去订这些货，并注明需要量很大。但结果总是远远不能完全满足要求。贸易基地总是一个劲的说：货不够。
    今年第一季度，塔尔塞城的消费合作社区联合社一共才领到了六百二十匣火柴。此外，也不是所有的商店，更不是随便什么时候都卖火柴的，即使有卖，也得定量。
    在阿塞拜疆共和国的一些地区，农村商店里没有足够数量的学生制服、连衣裙、棉布裤。大衣和外套只有个子很高的男人才能穿，少年学生能穿的却没有。
    农村商业网的鞋供应不足，儿童皮鞋也少得可怜。
    农村文化用品、家务用具也很缺，甚至开关、插座、电熨斗、小电炉都不够卖。连电灯泡也买不着。
