Editor's Note: The Soviet revisionist leadership has fully restored capitalism at home and is fully implementing the revisionist line in education. Their so-called "education reform" has turned Soviet education into one that completely serves the bourgeois privileged class.

From the materials published in today's newspaper, it is clear that the educational system implemented by the Soviet revisionists is thoroughly a bourgeois educational system, a breeding ground for spiritual aristocrats and revisionist successors.

The Soviet revisionist leadership often uses some grand and lofty phrases to cover up the bourgeois nature of Soviet education, such as "educating the youth in communism" and "cultivating all-around communist builders." All these are deceitful lies. The Soviet schools indoctrinate students with revisionist ideas, aiming to cultivate a generation of young people who are detached from the laboring masses, stand above the laboring people, and have a bourgeois worldview, to maintain and consolidate their revisionist rule.

Moreover, it is evident that there is a stark contrast between the rich and the poor, and extreme inequality in Soviet education. On one hand, the children of the bourgeois privileged class enjoy various superior conditions, do as they please, and rise to prominence. On the other hand, the children of the working class and peasants suffer discrimination and suppression. In the Soviet educational and academic circles, scholars monopolize knowledge, act arrogantly, and engage in factional struggles. All these are reflections of the capitalist system of human exploitation in the cultural and educational sphere.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's heinous crimes in restoring capitalism and poisoning the younger generation will surely be settled by the Soviet people.

As an important component of the superstructure, education is an important tool of class struggle. The Soviet revisionist ruling class, through "reforming" education, peddles revisionist goods in education, making education an important stronghold for their fake communism and true capitalism in the Soviet Union.

	Encouraging the White Specialist Road

The Soviet revisionists vigorously advocate that knowledge is the "highest arbiter." In Soviet revisionist educational thought, it is everywhere evident that "academic education comes first," and academic performance is the sole criterion for evaluating students, leading students to a path of detachment from reality and labor, pursuing only book knowledge, the white specialist road.

The Soviet revisionists use the scholarship system as a means of material incentive to encourage white specialists. If the grades are not good, no scholarship is given; the better the grades, the higher the scholarship. In this way, children from the privileged class with a good cultural foundation, with a little effort, can achieve good grades, obtain high scholarships and the title of "excellent student," and enjoy various preferential treatments upon graduation.

Under the slogan of "knowledge is the highest arbiter," Soviet higher education institutions vigorously exclude the children of the working class. Soviet publications even openly disparage labor youth, saying they are "people who lack both ability and the willingness to devote themselves to science." In addition, the Soviet revisionists use the elimination system to drive working-class and peasant youth out of school. According to the *Soviet Russia* newspaper, the number of students eliminated from the Ural University in the past five years has nearly doubled, with "those with work experience" making up the majority.

	Indoctrinating Revisionist Thought

The Soviet revisionists, with the full restoration of capitalism as their guideline, indoctrinate students with revisionist ideas.

The Soviet revisionist group has edited and published a large number of revisionist textbooks, distorting Soviet history, fiercely attacking Stalin, and criticizing the dictatorship of the proletariat, stuffing in the revisionist goods of "three harmonies and two integrities." Among them, *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union*, *Principles of Marxism*, and *Principles of Marxist Philosophy* are their carefully crafted anti-Marxist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisons.

To strengthen ideological control, the Soviet revisionist group, after deciding in 1963 to offer *Sociology* in the senior high school classes, decided in 1964 to offer *Principles of Communism* in higher education institutions. These courses vigorously advocate Khrushchev's revisionist line and fiercely attack Marxism-Leninism.

The Soviet revisionists also advocate bourgeois humanitarianism in education, advocating that "treating people as friends, comrades, and brothers should be the principle that young people always follow." They even claim that "communism, we believe, is also benevolence." In addition, the Soviet revisionist group vigorously indoctrinates young people with the revisionist black goods of a "world without weapons and war," shamelessly saying, "The Soviet Union will not tolerate giving children textbooks that propagate war, because all wars will bring disasters to the people," and so on.

	Corrupting Youth with Fame and Wealth

The Soviet educational system widens the social gap and is a ladder for the privileged class to ascend to the upper echelons of society. A university diploma is a pass to officialdom and wealth; with a diploma, one has everything. The Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, openly advocates the bourgeois view of "those who labor with their minds rule over others," saying that the task of higher education institutions is to "cultivate production organizers and experts," and the difference in educational attainment determines the difference in young people's future social status.

University graduates can climb to the ranks of scientists, professors, and managers, with their treatment vastly different from that of workers and peasants. Engineers earn 100 to 300 rubles per month, factory directors 300 to 1,000 rubles, and professors 350 to 2,500 rubles. While ordinary workers earn only 35 to 90 rubles per month.

Soviet university students, after enduring two years, start from the third year to work on their annual thesis with a mentor, preparing for their graduation thesis. If considered a "genius," they will then be promoted to do graduate work. Once they graduate with a candidate of sciences degree, the "genius" cultivation phase is over, and they can then rely on their own "abilities" to strive for higher positions.

The Soviet revisionist rulers thus corrupt the youth with fame and wealth, cultivating their so-called "geniuses" into successors who will serve their revisionist rule.

Under this educational system, young people only know how to strive in various ways to pursue fame and wealth. Cheating in exams is widespread and open. Some classes in Moscow University even have the Communist Youth League branches leading members to cheat in an organized manner.

The reactionary educational system of the Soviet revisionists has caused serious discontent among the people. The Soviet people, with their revolutionary traditions, will surely rise up to overthrow the Soviet revisionist ruling class and smash the current revisionist educational system.

    苏修在教育方面全力推行修正主义路线
    培养修正主义接班人　为苏修反动统治服务
    编者按　苏修领导集团在国内全面复辟资本主义，在教育方面全力推行修正主义路线。他们进行的所谓教育“改革”，已把苏联教育改成完全为资产阶级特权阶层服务的了。
    从本报今天发表的一些材料中就可以看清楚，苏修所推行的教育制度，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级教育制度，是培养精神贵族、培养修正主义接班人的温床。
    苏修领导集团经常用一些冠冕堂皇的词句，来掩盖苏联教育的资产阶级性质，什么“以共产主义教育青年”呀，“培养全面发展的共产主义建设者”呀，这些通通都是骗人的鬼话。苏联的学校向学生灌输的是修正主义的一套，其目的就是把苏联年青的一代培养成为脱离劳动人民、高居于劳动人民之上、满脑袋资产阶级世界观的修正主义者，来维护和巩固他们的修正主义统治。
    不仅如此，人们还可以清楚地看到，在苏联的教育中，明显地存在着贫富悬殊，存在着极端的不平等。一方面是资产阶级特权阶层的子弟享受着种种优越条件，为所欲为，飞黄腾达，一方面是工农劳动人民的子弟遭受排挤和打击。在苏联的教育界学术界，学阀垄断知识，飞扬跋扈，割据纷争。所有这一切，都是人剥削人的资本主义制度在文化教育领域的反映。
    苏修领导集团在复辟资本主义和毒害苏联青年一代方面犯下的滔天罪行，必将受到苏联人民的清算。
    作为上层建筑重要组成部分的教育，是阶级斗争的重要工具。苏修统治集团通过“改革”教育，在教育中大肆贩卖修正主义货色，使教育成为他们在苏联搞假共产主义真资本主义的重要阵地。	  鼓励走白专道路
    苏修大力宣扬什么知识是“最高仲裁者”。在苏修教育思想上，处处表现为“智育第一”，学习成绩是衡量学生的唯一标准，使学生走上脱离实际、脱离劳动，单纯追求书本知识的白专道路。
    苏修把助学金制度作为对学生进行物质刺激，鼓励白专的手段。成绩不好，就不给助学金，成绩愈好，助学金愈高。这样，文化基础好的特权阶层子女，只要稍加努力，取得较好的成绩，就能获得高额助学金和“优等生”的称号，并且在毕业分配时能够享受种种优惠待遇。
    在知识是“最高仲裁者”的口号下，苏修高等学校极力排斥劳动人民子女。苏修报刊甚至公开贬低劳动青年，说他们是“既没有能力，又不愿献身于科学的人”。此外，苏修还利用淘汰制，把工农青年赶出学校。据《苏维埃俄罗斯报》透露，乌拉尔大学最近五年淘汰的人数几乎增加了二倍，其中“有工龄的人占多数”。	  灌输修正主义思想
    苏修以全面复辟资本主义的苏共纲领为纲，向学生灌输修正主义思想。
    苏修集团编辑出版了大批修正主义的教科书，篡改苏联历史，大反斯大林、攻击无产阶级专政，把“三和两全”的修正主义货色一古脑儿塞了进去。其中，《苏联共产党历史》、《马克思主义原理》、《马克思主义哲学原理》就是他们精心炮制的反马克思主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草。
    为了加强思想控制，苏修集团继一九六三年决定在中学毕业班开设《社会学》之后，一九六四年又决定在高等学校开设《共产主义原理》课。这种课程大肆宣扬赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，猖狂地攻击马克思列宁主义。
    苏修在教育中还宣扬资产阶级人道主义，鼓吹“把人与人是朋友、同志和兄弟当作青年们永远遵循的原则”。他们甚至宣称“共产主义，我们认为也就是仁慈。”此外，苏修集团还极力向青年灌输“没有武器，没有战争的世界”的修正主义黑货，公然无耻地说：“苏联决不容忍把宣传战争的教科书给儿童看，因为凡是战争都会给人民带来灾难”等等。用名利地位腐蚀青年
    苏修的教育制度使社会差距扩大，是特权阶层子女登上上层社会的阶梯。大学文凭是升官发财的通行证，有了文凭就有了一切。苏修高教部长叶留金公开宣扬“劳心者治人”的资产阶级观点，说什么“高等学校的任务培养生产组织者和专家”，受教育程度的差别决定了青年未来社会地位的差别。
    大学毕业生可以爬上科学家、教授和经理阶层，他们的待遇与工农相差悬殊，工程师工资每月一百至三百卢布，厂长三百至一千卢布，教授三百五十至二千五百卢布。而一般工人工资每月仅三十五至九十卢布。
    苏联的大学生在熬过两个学年以后，从三年级开始，就得跟一个导师开始作学年论文，为以后的毕业论文作准备。如果被认为有“天才”，以后就会被提为作研究生。只要研究生毕业，得到副博士学位，则“天才”的培养阶段就算结束，以后就可以靠自己的“本领”努力向上爬了。
    苏修统治者就是这样用名利地位来腐蚀青年，把他们所谓的“天才”培养成继承他们衣钵的、为他们的修正主义统治服务的“人才”。
    在这种教育制度下，青年人只知道千方百计地为追逐名利而“努力”。考试作弊现象是普遍而且公开的。莫斯科大学有些班级的共青团支部还领导团员有组织地作弊。
    苏修反动的教育制度引起人民的严重不满。具有革命传统的苏联人民，终将起来推翻苏修统治集团，砸烂现行的修正主义教育制度。
