According to preliminary statistics from early September, the national salt production has completed 73.4% of the annual plan. Major production areas such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai have all seen significant increases in salt production compared to the same period last year. Salt fields in Xinjiang, Zhejiang, as well as parts of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Inner Mongolia have all completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

	The main products of the Capital Iron and Steel Company, including pig iron, metallurgical coke, high-quality steel, cast pipes, and chemical products, have all completed the third-quarter production plan ahead of schedule. Among these, high-quality steel has completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule. Steelworkers have also successfully completed the production tasks for new steel varieties such as high-strength chain steel and bearing steel.

	The New Anjiang Hydropower Plant has exceeded its annual plan. China's first large-scale hydropower plant designed, equipped, and constructed independently—New Anjiang Hydropower Plant—completed and exceeded the 1967 national electricity generation plan by four months ahead of schedule by the end of August, setting a new record for daily electricity generation.
