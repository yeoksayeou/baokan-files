Title: Implementing the "New System" and Promoting Free Competition: The Soviet Revisionists Fully Restore Capitalism in Commerce

	Editor's Note: Lenin pointed out: "Free trade is the development of capitalism," "Free trade is capitalism, and capitalism is speculation. Ignoring this is very laughable."

	How is the situation in the Soviet Union today?

	Since the new leadership of the Soviet revisionists came to power, they have fully restored capitalism, and in commerce, just like in industry and agriculture, they have vigorously promoted the "new system" with profits as the guiding principle. Currently, Soviet commercial enterprises have implemented the "new system," completely regressing to the capitalist path.

	The ultimate goal of commercial enterprises implementing the "new system" is to make money. The managers of these enterprises have the power to freely dispose of the enterprise's funds. To make money, commercial enterprises can freely link up with industrial enterprises and "freely choose their partners"; to make money, they engage in free competition and freely raise prices based on market conditions. These enterprises, which hang the "state-owned" sign, have essentially become the turf for new and old bourgeois elements to get rich.

	On one hand, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique fully promotes the "new system" in commercial enterprises, and on the other hand, they vigorously develop urban and rural free markets. Due to these retrograde actions, speculation, corruption, fraud, and extortion have become rampant in the Soviet commercial system. In state-owned stores, goods are scarce, and working people cannot buy necessary items, while the prices of goods in free markets are exorbitant. The lives of the broad Soviet working people are getting worse day by day.

	The Soviet revisionist ruling clique loudly proclaims that implementing the "new system" and developing free markets is to stimulate production and "advance towards communism." Ironclad facts prove that this is all a pack of lies. What they are doing, as Lenin said, is pure and simple free trade, pure and simple capitalism.

	While the Soviet revisionist leadership restores capitalism in industry and agriculture, they also strive to promote the "new system" centered on profits in commerce and vigorously promote free competition.

	According to reports in Soviet publications, by June of this year, approximately 400,000 stores and restaurants had implemented the "new system," which is nearly half of all commercial enterprises in the country. Commercial units in the republics of Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all fully implemented the "new system."

	This "new system," which completely restores capitalism in commerce, was proposed as early as the spring of 1965. According to the "new system," the state only sets the turnover amount and profit targets for stores, that is, it only manages how much is sold and how much profit is made, while everything else is decided by the store managers.

	Soviet leader Kosygin emphasized that the "new system" should "fully strengthen economic incentives for production" and that "industrial enterprises should establish direct links with commercial organizations." Soviet publications proclaim this as "free choice of partners" and as "allowing industrial, agricultural, and commercial enterprises, as well as all other enterprise units, to independently and autonomously establish economic relations with each other." Soviet newspapers also extensively advocate the importance of the market and market conditions, promoting free competition among enterprises and freely adjusting prices based on market conditions.

	The "new system" further expands the power of store managers to control enterprises. Store managers can "control the funds of commercial enterprises," have "greater independence in formulating commodity turnover plans," can "directly sign contracts with suppliers," and have the power to "hire, fire, encourage, discipline, and adjust staff."

	Commercial enterprises implementing the "new system" pursue profits through free competition, engage in deception, speculation, fraud, extortion, embezzlement, and bribery, exhibiting all the capitalist commercial phenomena. According to reports in Soviet publications, "speculators live freely in stores." Some store leaders also extort customers to fill their own pockets. For example, the manager of the Ninth Consumer Store in Riga privately raised the price of cotton fabric from 2 rubles 60 kopecks per meter to 3 rubles 2 kopecks. The manager of the 34th Meat Market in Leninabad arbitrarily sold pork at a high price. Some stores deduct half a kilogram from every 10 kilograms of bread sold.

	These retrograde actions of pursuing profits through free competition have caused chaos in the supply of goods. According to Soviet newspapers, after direct ordering between industry and commerce, commerce complains that factories cannot meet the ordering needs of the commercial sector, while factories complain that there are too many scattered ordering units, "causing chaos," and the vast majority of customers cannot buy the items they need.

	The "new system" further strengthens the oppression and exploitation of the broad masses of workers in commerce, turning them into hired slaves of the privileged class. More seriously, some store managers embezzle public funds but frame others, persecuting sales clerks.

	This capitalist commercial system has been resisted and opposed by the broad masses of workers in commercial enterprises since its implementation. The Soviet revisionist leadership cries out for "strengthening discipline" and "implementing administrative measures." A leader of a food store, for example, imposed administrative penalties on 150 out of 500 employees in the first nine months of 1966 alone. However, where there is oppression, there is necessarily resistance. The Soviet working people will surely rise up to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

### 推行“新体制”　大搞自由竞争  苏修在商业中全面复辟资本主义

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

　　推行“新体制”　大搞自由竞争
    苏修在商业中全面复辟资本主义
    编者按　列宁指出：“自由贸易就是资本主义的发展”，“贸易自由就是资本主义，资本主义就是投机活动，忽视这一点是很可笑的。”
    今天苏联的状况如何呢？
    自从苏修新领导上台以来，全面复辟资本主义，在商业中也同工农业一样，大力推行利润挂帅的“新体制”。目前苏联的商业企业实行了“新体制”，完全倒退到资本主义的道路上去了。
    实行“新体制”的商业企业，最高的目的就是赚钱，企业经理握有自由支配企业基金的大权。为了赚钱，商业企业可以自由同工业企业挂钩，可以“自由选择对方”；为了赚钱，它们大搞自由竞争，根据行情自由抬高物价。这些挂着“国营”招牌的商业企业，实质上已完全变成了新旧资产阶级分子发财致富的地盘。
    苏修统治集团一方面在商业企业中全面推行“新体制”，一方面大力发展城乡自由市场。由于这些倒行逆施，苏联商业系统中投机倒把、营私舞弊、欺诈勒索泛滥成灾。在国营商店里，商品奇缺，劳动人民买不到生活必需品，而自由市场上的商品价格昂贵，苏联广大劳动人民的日子一天比一天更不好过了。
    苏修统治集团口口声声叫嚷什么，实行“新体制”和发展自由市场是为了刺激生产，“向共产主义迈进”。铁的事实证明，这完全是骗人的鬼话。他们搞的这一套，正如列宁所说的那样，是不折不扣的自由贸易，不折不扣的资本主义。
    苏修领导集团在工农业中复辟资本主义的同时，在商业中也极力推行以利润为核心的“新体制”，大搞自由竞争。
    据苏联报刊报道，到今年六月为止，已有约四十万个商店和饭馆实行“新体制”，这几乎占全国商业企业的二分之一。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛等加盟共和国的商业单位，已全部实行“新体制”。
    这个在商业中彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”，早在一九六五年春就提出来了。根据“新体制”，国家只给商店规定商品周转额和利润指标，也就是说只管卖多少钱和赚多少钱，而其他一切都由商店经理自行决定。
    苏修头目柯西金强调，“新体制”要“全力加强对生产的经济刺激”，“工业企业同商业组织建立直接联系”。苏联报刊宣扬这是“自由选择对方”，是“使工农商企业以及一切其他企业单位能够独立自主地建立它们彼此之间的经济关系”。苏联报纸还大肆鼓吹市场和行情的“重要性”，提倡企业之间自由竞争，根据行情自由调整价格。
      “新体制”进一步扩大商店经理操纵企业的权力。商店经理可以“支配商业企业的基金”，“在拟定商品周转计划时有更大的独立性”，可以“同供应者直接签订合同”，“有雇佣、解雇、鼓励、处分及调整工作人员的权力”。
    实行“新体制”的商业企业，为追逐利润大搞自由竞争，弄虚作假，投机倒把，欺诈勒索，贪污行贿等资本主义商业现象无所不有。据苏联报刊透露，商店里的“投机倒把分子自由自在地生活着”。有的商店领导人还敲诈顾客，以饱私囊。例如里加市消费第九商店主任私自将棉布的价格从每米两个卢布六十戈比提高到三个卢布二个戈比。列宁纳巴德第三十四肉类门市部主任擅自以高价出卖猪肉。有的商店出售每十公斤面包就从中克扣半公斤。
    这种为追逐利润而自由竞争的倒行逆施给商品供应造成混乱。据苏联报纸透露，工商业实行直接订货后，商业抱怨工厂不能满足商业部门的订货需要，工厂则埋怨分散订货单位太多，“造成混乱”，而广大顾客则买不到自己所需要的物品。
      “新体制”进一步加强了对商业中广大职工的压迫和剥削，把职工变成特权阶层的雇佣奴隶。更严重的是一些商店经理贪污盗窃公款，却嫁祸于人，对售货员进行迫害。
    这个资本主义的商业制度，从一开始推行就遭到商业企业中广大职工的抵制和反对。苏修领导集团大叫要“加强纪律”，要执行“行政措施”。有一个食品商店的领导人仅在一九六六年的头九个月中，“就对五百个工作人员中的一百五十人作了行政处分”。但是，有压迫就必然有反抗。苏联劳动人民必将奋起彻底摧毁苏修领导集团的反动统治。
