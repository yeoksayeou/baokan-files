	Never Pity Snake-Like Villains

	The Chinese Khrushchev advocates "three independences and one contract" with extremely evil intentions. He wants us to disregard state planning and revolutionary interests, to produce whatever we want and sell to whomever we want. He aims to deceive us into boarding the capitalist bandwagon, to sabotage the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. Let me tell the Chinese Khrushchev: your scheme is miscalculated. We poor and lower-middle peasants have studied the "Three Articles," cast off selfish thoughts, and established the idea of farming for the revolution. During the time when you were spreading the "three independences and one contract" black wind, we insisted on the socialist collective economy and firmly walked the socialist path. Not a single household in our brigade fell for your tricks or was deceived by you. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev has already been exposed by all revolutionary people across the country, dragged down into the mud, and become a "drowning dog." However, he is still struggling desperately, trying to climb back up and bite people. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "Never pity snake-like villains," and must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating "drowning dogs." We will deeply develop the great criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev!

　　决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人
    中国赫鲁晓夫提倡“三自一包”的用心是极其恶毒的。他要我们不要国家计划，不顾革命利益，想生产什么就生产什么，生产出来的东西想卖给啥人就卖给啥人。他想用这个办法骗我们上资本主义贼船，破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设，达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。老实告诉中国赫鲁晓夫：你这套如意算盘打错了。我们贫下中农学了“老三篇”，斗掉了一事当前先替自己打算的私心，树立了为革命种田的思想。在你大刮“三自一包”黑风的时候，我们坚持社会主义集体经济，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，全队没有一户上你的当，受你的骗。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫已经被我们全国革命人民揪了出来，打下了水，成了一只“落水狗”，但是他还在作垂死的挣扎，还想跳上岸来咬人。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”，一定要发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，深入开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫批深、斗臭！
