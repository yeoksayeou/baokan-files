Rangoon, September 3 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Embassy in Burma issued a strong protest to the Burmese Foreign Ministry on September 2, condemning the brutal murder of the patriotic overseas Chinese Lin Hongzhu by the reactionary government of Ne Win.

The protest demanded that the Burmese reactionary government immediately punish the murderers and those who ordered the killing; immediately compensate the family of the victim; hold a solemn memorial and burial ceremony for Lin Hongzhu, and publicly apologize to the Chinese people and patriotic overseas Chinese.

Lin Hongzhu was murdered by the Burmese reactionary government for wearing a badge of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and attending the Chinese Embassy's National Day reception. Before his murder, he was illegally summoned by the Burmese reactionary military authorities. On July 3, he was illegally arrested and subjected to inhuman torture, and was killed in prison the next day.

After Lin Hongzhu's murder, the Burmese reactionary government, in order to cover up its fascist atrocities, arbitrarily restricted his family from examining the body, allowing them to see only his face and not the rest of the body.

The protest stated that under the fascist dictatorship of Ne Win in Burma, the rights of overseas Chinese to love their great leader and their motherland have been stripped away. All these patriotic activities of overseas Chinese have become "crimes," which is indeed a strange thing! In short, the Burmese reactionary government's extreme hatred towards patriotic overseas Chinese wearing Chairman Mao's badge and its arbitrary prohibition of patriotic overseas Chinese from having normal contact with the Chinese Embassy is because it is extremely afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and extremely afraid that the patriotic actions of overseas Chinese in loving Chairman Mao and their motherland will have a revolutionary impact on the Burmese people.

The protest said: "The Chinese people will forever remember the new blood debt owed by the Burmese reactionary government. The Chinese people will definitely avenge the heroic martyr Lin Hongzhu who sacrificed his life under the fascist butcher's knife of the Burmese reactionary government!"

The protest once again sternly warned the Burmese reactionary government: "Murder must be avenged. You are so lawless, committing crimes, and arbitrarily killing overseas Chinese. The Chinese people will never forgive you. You will surely be severely punished by the people of both China and Burma!"

　　我驻缅使馆最强烈抗议缅反动派杀害爱国华侨林鸿珠
　　中国人民绝不饶恕奈温反动政府的罪行
    新华社三日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二日照会缅甸外交部，最强烈地抗议奈温反动政府残酷杀害缅甸勃生爱国华侨林鸿珠的血腥罪行。
    照会强烈要求缅甸反动政府立即惩办杀害林鸿珠的凶手和指使者；立即抚恤被害者家属；为林鸿珠烈士举行隆重追悼和安葬仪式并公开向中国人民和爱国华侨低头认罪。
    林鸿珠是因为爱国华侨佩戴中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像章和出席中国大使馆国庆招待会遭到缅甸反动政府杀害的。他在被杀害以前，曾被缅甸反动军事当局非法传讯。今年七月三日，缅甸反动军事当局非法逮捕了他，并对他施以惨无人道的酷刑，第二天即将他杀害在狱中。
    林鸿珠被害以后，缅甸反动政府为了掩盖其法西斯暴行，在林鸿珠家属前往认尸时，竟蛮横地限定家属只能看面部，不准察看遗体的其他部分。
    照会说，在法西斯独裁者奈温统治下的缅甸，华侨热爱自己伟大领袖和热爱祖国的权利遭到剥夺，所有这些华侨的爱国活动都成了“罪状”，这岂非天下之怪事！说穿了，缅甸反动政府如此疯狂地反对爱国华侨佩戴毛主席像章，蛮横禁止爱国华侨同中国大使馆的正当来往，是因为它极端地惧怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，极端地惧怕爱国华侨热爱毛主席和热爱祖国的正当行动在缅甸人民中产生革命的影响。
    照会说：“中国人民将永远记住缅甸反动政府新欠下的这一笔新的血债，中国人民一定要为光荣牺牲在缅甸反动政府法西斯屠刀下的林鸿珠烈士报仇！”
    照会再一次严正警告缅甸反动政府：“杀人必须偿命。你们如此无法无天，为非作歹，任意杀害华侨，中国人民绝对饶不了你们。你们定将受到中缅两国人民严厉的惩罚！”
