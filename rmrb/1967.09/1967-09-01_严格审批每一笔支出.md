Title: Strictly Approve Every Expenditure

I am temporarily in charge of financial approval work at a factory in Wuhu, Anhui. Recently, I encountered the following situation in my work: This year's funds for preventing heatstroke and cooling down, after consultation with relevant departments, were decided to be executed according to the past standards, that is, the funds for workers engaged in high-temperature operations are higher than those for cadres. However, during the execution, someone proposed that such a distinction is unnecessary and that the standard for cadres' funds for preventing heatstroke and cooling down should be raised. Some even labeled this necessary distinction as the "reactionary bourgeois line."

Faced with this situation, I thought that although I am temporarily in charge of financial approval work, I cannot be careless. Every expenditure must be approved with a sense of responsibility to the people. I carefully studied the relevant documents and believed that the current system for funds to prevent heatstroke and cooling down is basically reasonable and in line with the principle of "frugality for revolution." Therefore, I continued to approve according to the past standards. Afterwards, some people said I was a "dogmatist." I think that for the sake of the country's interests and the people's interests, a revolutionary financial worker should be able to withstand such idle talk.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has called on us to "be frugal and make revolution." We, who work in the financial department, must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, put the public interest first, and not be extravagant or wasteful.

　　严格审批每一笔支出
    我在安徽芜湖一个工厂临时负责财务审批工作。最近在工作中碰到这样一件事情：今年防暑降温经费，经和有关部门协商，决定仍按过去的标准执行，即从事高温操作工人的费用高于干部。但在执行过程中有人提出：这种区别是不必要的，应该提高干部防暑降温经费的标准。甚至有人把这种必要的区分说成是“资产阶级反动路线”。
    面对这一情况，我想虽然自己临时负责财务审批工作，也不能马马虎虎，每审批一笔开支，必须向人民负责。我认真学习了有关文件，认为目前执行的防暑降温经费制度基本上是合理的，是符合节约闹革命的原则的。于是我就仍按过去的标准审批。事后有人说我是“教条主义”。我想为了国家利益，为了人民的利益，一个革命财会人员应该顶得住这些闲言蜚语。
    伟大领袖毛主席号召我们“要节约闹革命”。我们在财务部门工作的同志，一定要按毛主席的指示办事，公字当头，不要大手大脚，慷国家之慨。
