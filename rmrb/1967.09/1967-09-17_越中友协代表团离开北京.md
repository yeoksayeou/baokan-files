A delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Nguyen Van Huan and Ho Kwei, departed Beijing this morning. The delegation, carrying the fighting friendship of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people, boarded a special plane.

Relevant officials from China, including Zhang Siyi, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, and Han Nianlong, as well as revolutionary masses from the capital, were at the airport to see them off.

As the Vietnamese friends boarded the plane, the revolutionary masses of the capital waved and shouted slogans: "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression for national salvation!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism of the Soviet Union!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

The acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, Le Chung Chi, and the representative of the Vietnam National Liberation Front's permanent delegation in China, Le Thong San, were also at the airport to see them off.
