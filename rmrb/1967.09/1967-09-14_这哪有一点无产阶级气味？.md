Where is there any whiff of the proletariat?

The Chinese Khrushchev has long harbored the ambition to usurp the Party, usurp the government, and restore capitalism. The so-called "whole people's party" is just a facade for his plot to usurp the Party. In the black book *Self-Cultivation*, he loudly proclaims: "Those who join our Party are not only from different family backgrounds and personal classes, but they come with all sorts of different purposes and motives.... We welcome these people." What kind of talk is this? According to his words, our Party is not an instrument of proletarian dictatorship, but rather a social institution for finding jobs, finding work, and finding books to read. According to his words, joining the Communist Party is not for the cause of communism, but for "getting ahead," "having a way out," and becoming a stepping stone for climbing up. According to his words, people from different classes can join the Party with various purposes and motives, then landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists can all rush in.... In this way, the Communist Party would not be a vanguard of the proletariat, but a motley crowd, a chaotic social organization! Where is there any whiff of the proletariat vanguard? Such a Party would only be a genuine party of the landlords and the bourgeoisie! For the Chinese Khrushchev to spout such words is not accidental. Because he himself is a representative of the bourgeoisie who mixed into the Party to "get ahead" and "find a way out." Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!

    这哪有一点无产阶级气味？
    中国赫鲁晓夫，阴谋篡党、篡政、复辟资本主义的野心由来已久。所谓“全民党”，就是他阴谋篡党的一个幌子。在黑《修养》中，他就大肆叫嚷什么：“加入我们党的人，不只是家庭出身和本人成份各不相同，而且是带着各种各色不同的目的和动机而来的。……我们对于这些人是欢迎的。”这是什么话？按照他的说法，我们的党，不是无产阶级专政的工具，而是为人找职业、找工作、找书读的社会机构；按照他的说法，加入共产党不是为了共产主义事业，而是为了“吃得开”、“有出路”，成为向上爬的阶梯；按照他的说法，各个不同阶级的人可抱着各种不同目的和动机而进党，那末，地主、富农、资本家也就都可蜂拥而入，……这样，共产党岂不成了一群乌合之众，成了一个乌七八糟的社会团体了吗？这哪里还有一点无产阶级先锋队的气味？这样的党只能是地地道道的地主、资产阶级的政党！从中国赫鲁晓夫嘴里吐出这样的话，绝不是偶然的。因为他本来就是为了“吃得开”、“找出路”而混进党里来的资产阶级代表人物。打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！
