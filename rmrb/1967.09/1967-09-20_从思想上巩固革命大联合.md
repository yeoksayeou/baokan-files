Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached Shanghai during the height of the revolutionary criticism movement, and the revolutionary great alliance within Shanghai's working class has taken on an unprecedented new situation, adding new luster to Shanghai's excellent conditions.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions spoke the hearts of Shanghai's million workers. Through over a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers and the revolutionary masses of all fronts have deeply felt that only by uniting and joining forces can we defeat our common enemy. If we do not achieve a revolutionary great alliance, each forming our own factions, constantly engaging in "internal warfare," and fighting, we will only cause pain to our friends and joy to our enemies. Therefore, achieving a revolutionary great alliance is the trend of the times and the will of the people, and no force can stop this surging revolutionary tide.

After achieving organizational unity in the revolutionary great alliance, we must continually strengthen and elevate it in thought. Only through ideological unity can organizational unity withstand any difficulties and storms; only then can we unleash our greatest fighting power, concentrate our forces, focus our targets, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units; only then can we smoothly achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; only then can we seize power and use power properly.

How can we strengthen the revolutionary great alliance in thought? The most fundamental principle is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, enhance proletarian party spirit, and overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of strengthening the revolutionary great alliance in thought.

Even after achieving the revolutionary great alliance, new setbacks and twists may still arise. However, as long as we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, with the broad-mindedness of the proletariat, consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, not dwell on old scores, not hold onto minor issues, and insist that revolutionary interests are paramount, and frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism, there will be no insurmountable contradictions.

    从思想上巩固革命大联合
    在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示传到革命大批判高潮中的上海，上海工人阶级队伍革命的大联合，出现了空前未有的新局面，为上海的大好形势增添了新的光彩。
    毛主席的最新指示，说出了上海百万工人的心里话。我们工人阶级和各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，深深地体会到各个革命群众组织只有联合起来，团结起来，才能战胜共同的敌人；不实行革命大联合，你一个山头，我一个山头，整天打“内战”，搞武斗，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。所以实现革命的大联合，是大势所趋，人心所向，任何力量也阻挡不住这股革命洪流汹涌前进。
    在组织上实现革命的大联合后，还必须从思想上不断地加以巩固和提高。只有思想上的大联合，组织上的大联合才能经得起任何艰难险阻，经得起任何惊涛骇浪；才能发挥最大的战斗力，集中力量，集中目标，狠狠地向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，搞好本单位的斗批改；才能顺利地实现革命的“三结合”；才能掌好权、用好权。
    怎样才能从思想上巩固革命的大联合呢？最根本的一条，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，破私立公，增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性。战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们从思想上巩固革命大联合的灵魂。
    在实现革命大联合后，也还可能出现新的反复和曲折，但是，只要我们最坚决地听毛主席的话，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以无产阶级应有的宽阔胸怀，顾大局，识大体，不算老账，不揪住枝节问题不放，坚持革命利益高于一切，经常开展批评和自我批评，就没有不可克服的矛盾。
