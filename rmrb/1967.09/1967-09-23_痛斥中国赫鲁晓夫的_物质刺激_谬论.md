The revolutionary workers of the Ceramics Factory No. 3 in Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, are vigorously criticizing the fallacies of "material incentives" advocated by China's Khrushchev in the current wave of deepening revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and with the help of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in supporting the left and supporting production, they have criticized China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "material incentives."

Since 1964, under the direct control of a small clique of capitalists within the original county committee who were taking the capitalist road, this factory, following China's Khrushchev's black directive to "implement material incentives" and "have a reward system, not necessarily rewarding with products, money can also be used as a reward," used the excuse that production was not increasing to forcefully implement a set of "bonus-based" black systems. They said, "If production does not increase, this method can motivate the workers' enthusiasm, can complete the state plan, and increase the welfare of the workers, which is beneficial to both the state and the workers." They cut the time for workers to study Chairman Mao's works before starting work each day, abolished the study and discussion sessions of Chairman Mao's works, disbanded the organizations studying Chairman Mao's works, and opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, saying, "Studying Chairman Mao's works is not as effective as getting bonuses," "Now production is the key, if the task is not completed, politics is of no use."

The result of implementing the black systems of "material incentives" and "bonus-based" was to corrupt and poison the souls of many workers, making some workers constantly calculate how much bonus they can get and how much money they can earn. With more money in their minds, politics became less, "self" became more, and "public" became less. They only cared about their personal and immediate interests, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat, forgetting Chairman Mao's teaching: "Serve the people of the whole of China and the whole world." Some workers, in order to get more over-quota bonuses, rushed to work, only caring about quantity and ignoring quality. Some workers quarreled and had disagreements over bonuses. Some workers, because they had more money, began to pay attention to eating and drinking, and to pursue fashionable clothing, becoming captives of the bourgeoisie. Workers at the criticism meeting angrily said: China's Khrushchev's implementation of "material incentives," "bonus-based" and other systems has greatly corrupted and poisoned us workers. "Material incentives" are like opium; once you take it, your intestines will turn black, you will change color, you will forget Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and you will comfortably and peacefully transform. We, the working class, will not be fooled by him.

    痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”谬论
    辽宁省海城县陶瓷三厂广大革命职工，在当前深入开展革命大批判的新高潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在支左支工的中国人民解放军帮助下，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“物质刺激”的谬论。
    这个工厂从一九六四年起，在原县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派直接控制下，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫要搞“物质刺激”“要有奖励制度，不一定奖产品，奖钱也可以”的黑指示，以产量上不去为理由，不顾革命职工的坚决反对，强制推行了一套“奖金挂帅”的黑制度，说什么“产量上不来，用这个办法可以调动工人的积极性，能够完成国家计划，增加职工的福利，对国家对职工都有好处。”他们砍去了职工每天上班前学习毛主席著作的时间，砍去了学习毛主席著作讲用会等制度，解散了学习毛主席著作的组织，反对突出无产阶级政治，说什么“学习毛主席著作没有奖金来的快”，“现在生产是硬头货，任务完不成，什么政治也没有用了。”
    实行“物质刺激，奖金挂帅”等一套黑制度的结果，腐蚀和毒害了不少工人的灵魂，使一些工人整天盘算能领多少奖金，能多得多少钞票。头脑里钞票多了，政治就少了，“私”字多了，“公”字就少了。他们只顾个人眼前利益，局部利益，忘记了无产阶级的根本利益，忘记了毛主席教导的：“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。”有的工人为了自己多得超额奖金，上班拚命打“冲锋”，只顾数量，不顾质量。有的工人为了评奖吵嘴、闹意见。有的工人由于钱多了，也开始讲究吃喝、追求穿戴，做了资产阶级的俘虏。职工们在批判会上愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫搞“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等种种制度，对我们工人的腐蚀、毒害很大。“物质刺激”和鸦片一样，吃了它就会肠子黑，就会变颜色，就会忘记毛主席的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，就会舒舒服服地和平演变过去。我们工人阶级决不上他的当。
