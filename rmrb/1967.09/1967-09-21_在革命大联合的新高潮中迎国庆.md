In the new high tide of revolutionary great unity, we welcome National Day.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding light for the revolutionary masses to achieve revolutionary great unity. All revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses should act swiftly, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the utmost enthusiasm, propagate them widely, and implement them resolutely. Let Chairman Mao's latest instructions be known to every household, understood by every child, truly become our soul, and further ignite a new high tide of revolutionary great unity. This is the best tribute to the brilliant National Day.

Strengthening and developing revolutionary great unity is an important measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses unite and consolidate under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a fatal blow to a handful of class enemies. "The walls have long been firmly built, and the resolve is even stronger." No matter how the enemy appears, whether as rightists or ultra-"leftists," they will be smashed to pieces in front of the revolutionary masses' iron wall. Where there has been long-term serious division, "internal warfare" becoming more intense, and constant escalation of armed struggles, there is often a handful of class enemies instigating. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses should calm down, open their eyes, and expose the bad elements. Revolutionary great unity will then be guaranteed.

In units where there is no great unity, all organizations should, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seriously examine their thoughts and work, especially conduct self-criticism. Both sides should seriously reflect: Why can't great unity be achieved? Once the real reason is found, measures to achieve revolutionary great unity in the unit should be immediately taken, and great strides should be made to catch up with the revolutionary situation. There can be no more lagging behind.

Let us carry out a more in-depth great criticism and achieve a broader great unity! Let us raise high the banner of revolutionary great unity and welcome the brilliant and great National Day with practical actions!

　　在革命大联合的新高潮中迎国庆
    毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合的指路明灯。一切革命群众组织，一切革命群众，火速行动起来，最热忱地学习最新指示，最广泛地宣传最新指示，最坚决地贯彻最新指示。让毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，妇孺皆知，真正化为我们的灵魂，进一步掀起革命大联合的新高潮，这是对光辉灿烂的国庆节的最好的献礼。
    巩固和发展革命大联合，是当前加强无产阶级专政的重要措施。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下大联合、大团结，这是对一小撮阶级敌人最沉重的致命打击。“早已森严壁垒，更加众志成城。”不管敌人以右或极“左”的面貌出现，都会在革命群众的铜墙铁壁面前碰得头破血流。凡是长期严重分裂，“内战”越搞越凶，武斗不断“升级”的地方，往往有一小撮阶级敌人在挑动。无产阶级革命派和革命群众应该冷静下来，擦亮眼睛，揪出坏人，革命大联合就有可靠的保证。
    凡是没有大联合的单位，各个组织都要按照毛主席的最新指示，认真检查自己的思想和工作，特别要进行自我批评。双方都要认真想一想：为什么不能实现大联合？找到了真正原因，就应立即采取实现本单位革命大联合的措施，大踏步地赶上革命形势，再也不能继续落后下去了。
    让我们更深入地开展大批判，更广泛地实现大联合！让我们高举革命大联合的旗帜，用实际行动迎接光辉伟大的国庆节！　（《文汇报》九月十五日社论）
