	Hundreds of Americans March Against the Vietnam War

	Hundreds of Americans are currently participating in a seven-week, 4,800-kilometer march across the United States to protest the Vietnam War. They set out from San Francisco on the west coast in late August and plan to pass through 190 cities, large and small, before arriving in Washington on October 21st to hold a large-scale protest against the war.

	Protest Against Recruitment for the War

	On the 11th, a crowd in New York City demonstrated in front of the U.S. government's "International Development Agency" office, protesting the agency's recruitment drive aimed at sending 1,500 civilian personnel to South Vietnam to serve in the U.S. invasion.

	90,000 Signatures Collected for Anti-War Petition

	Recently, active participants in the anti-Vietnam struggle launched a signature-collecting campaign in several important U.S. cities, demanding that the U.S. government hold a referendum on the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam during next year's elections. By early September, the "New York City Committee for an Immediate Withdrawal Referendum" had collected over 93,000 signatures through various means, including door-to-door visits and setting up stalls in busy areas.

	Demand for Immediate End to the War

	A group of American veterans who participated in the Vietnam War recently formed an organization in New York and issued a declaration stating, "We believe that the war in Vietnam is wrong, an unjust war. We join millions of Americans in protesting this war. We demand that our youth be immediately withdrawn from Vietnam. We demand an immediate end to this war."

	Black Soldier Refuses to Fight

	American Black soldier Ronald Lockman recently announced in New York that he refuses to obey orders to go to the Vietnam battlefield. In his statement, he said, "I don't want to go. I can't go. I don't want to be used again. I should go back home, back to where I was born and raised—Philadelphia's Black community. I will not travel ten thousand miles to be a tool for those oppressing the Vietnamese people."

	Veteran Self-Immolation in Protest

	An American veteran named John Copin self-immolated in mid-August in a city in California to protest the Vietnam War. In his will, he wrote, "I self-immolated to protest Johnson's war in Vietnam. This war... is a hopeless war."

    美国人民反对侵越战争
    五千公里长途进军
    数百名美国人为抗议美国侵越战争，目前正在进行持续七星期、全长四千八百公里、横穿美国的长途进军。他们是八月末从美国西海岸的旧金山市出发的，计划穿越一百九十个大小城市，并且在十月二十一日到达华盛顿后，举行一次大规模反侵越战争的抗议集会。
    不为侵越美军服务
    纽约市群众十一日在美国政府的“国际开发署”办事处门前举行示威，抗议这个机构大肆进行“招募”活动，妄图诱骗一千五百名文职人员去南越为美国的侵略战争服务。
    九万多人反战签名
    一些反侵越斗争的积极参加者不久前在美国一系列重要城市中发动了征集签名的运动，要求美国政府在明年大选时就美国侵略军立即撤出南越的问题举行公民投票。到九月初为止，“纽约市争取立即撤出（南越）公民投票委员会”通过登门访问、到闹市地区摆摊子等多种方式，已经征集到九万三千多人的签名。
    要求立即结束战争
    一批参加过侵越战争的美国退伍军人最近在纽约成立了组织，并发表宣言说：“我们认为美国在越南的战争是错误的，是一场不正义的战争。我们同千百万美国人一起，抗议这场战争。我们要求把我们的青年立即从越南撤回来。我们要求立即结束这场战争。”
    黑人士兵拒绝参战
    美国黑人士兵罗纳德·洛克曼几天前在纽约公开宣布，他拒绝接受随部队开赴侵越战场的命令。他在声明中说：“我不愿去。我不能去。我不愿再被人利用。我应该回到老家去，回到我出生和成长的地方——费城黑人区去战斗。我决不跋涉到万里之外去给压迫越南人民的人充当工具。”
    退伍军人自焚抗议
    一个名叫约翰·科平的美国退伍军人，为了抗议美国侵越战争，八月中旬在加利福尼亚州某城市自焚而死。他在留下的遗书中写道：“我实行自焚是为了抗议约翰逊在越南的战争。这场战争……是一场绝望的战争。”　（据新华社讯）
