The U.S. and the Soviet Union Utilize the United Nations General Assembly to Plot a New "Peace Talks" Deception
Deceptive Words Cannot Fool the Heroic Vietnamese People

	NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) — The U.S. imperialists, who are facing increasing internal and external difficulties due to their worsening defeat in the Vietnam War, are currently colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to use the recently convened 22nd United Nations General Assembly to launch a new "peace offensive" against the heroic Vietnamese people. They aim to force the Vietnamese people to accept the "peace talks" deception while preparing public opinion for the U.S. to further escalate the war in Vietnam.

	U.S. representative Arthur Goldberg's speech at the UN General Assembly on Sept. 21 revealed this new plot. His speech was filled with bandit-like justifications for U.S. aggression in Vietnam, cheap "peace" rhetoric, and a shabby "political solution" plan, such as "UN intervention," "bombing halt," "gradual reduction," and even "reconvening the Geneva Conference." All these old tricks have long been rejected by the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world. However, Goldberg, the salesman of U.S. Vietnam policy, was still shouting hoarsely at the UN General Assembly: "We Americans know the nature of a fair deal; no one needs to be afraid to negotiate with us."

	When Goldberg was peddling various U.S. "peace talks" plans, he emphasized the so-called "reconvening the Geneva Conference" plan. As usual, he avoided the fundamental fact that the U.S. sent nearly 500,000 troops across the ocean to Vietnam to kill and burn, and also carried out more than two years of intense bombing and other military aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, thereby completely tearing up the Geneva Agreement. He shamelessly talked about using the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements as the "basis" for "solving" the Vietnam problem and brought out the Geneva Agreement clauses that had been completely destroyed by the U.S., attempting to use this to promote "peace talks," to extricate the U.S. aggressors from their predicament in the South Vietnamese battlefield, and to achieve the U.S. imperialists' evil goal of permanently dividing Vietnam and continuing to occupy South Vietnam.

	The so-called "reconvening the Geneva Conference" plan is nothing new. However, it is noteworthy that this plan emerged in the context of further collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue. On Sept. 22, in another speech at the UN General Assembly, Goldberg blatantly stated that the U.S., whether playing the "bombing halt to induce peace" trick or plotting the "reconvening the Geneva Conference" deception, relies on the help of the Soviet side. On the same day, in a television interview, he publicly appealed to the Soviet revisionist group to "use its strength and influence" to help "achieve a political solution" to the Vietnam problem and expressed his hope to hold "several talks" with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for this purpose.

	Goldberg's remarks were not groundless. The Soviet revisionists have always been trying every means to serve the various "peace talks" deceptions of U.S. imperialism, especially since Soviet leader Alexei Kosygin personally went to the U.S. to hold the Glassboro Summit with Johnson in June this year, there have been continuous reports that the Soviet revisionists are helping the U.S. imperialists to carry out the plot to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

	Before the opening of the UN General Assembly, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were in collusion, intensifying the planning of a new round of "peace talks" deception. On Sept. 15, Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Dobrynin, who had just returned from a "vacation" in his home country, immediately held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk on the Vietnam issue and other matters, preparing for the scheduled Rusk-Gromyko talks. On the same day, Soviet Ambassador to the UK Vasily Vasilyev called on British Foreign Secretary George Brown, reportedly to discuss the Vietnam issue. On Sept. 21, Johnson personally met with the newly returned U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Llewellyn Thompson to discuss "all outstanding issues" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It was announced that during the UN General Assembly, foreign ministers of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and other countries would hold a series of intense talks. Western news agencies revealed that the Vietnam issue and the Middle East issue would be the central topics of the talks.

	Surrounding the intense collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, other lackeys of the U.S. imperialists, such as UN Secretary-General U Thant, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeo Miki, and the Tito clique, were also actively promoting the so-called "reopening of the Geneva Conference" plan.

	However, no matter how carefully the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists plot, and no matter how hard U Thant and his ilk promote, the U.S. imperialists' new "peace talks" plot will not succeed in the face of the Vietnamese people who are determined to fight to the end. In a recent letter to the people of South Vietnam, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the 31 million Vietnamese people, clearly and firmly declared: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Deceptive words cannot fool our compatriots." The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, whether they pressure or deceive, will ultimately only make themselves suffer!

### 美苏利用联合国大会加紧策划新的“和谈”骗局　狡猾的言词骗不了英雄的越南人民

　　美苏利用联合国大会加紧策划新的“和谈”骗局
　　狡猾的言词骗不了英雄的越南人民
    新华社二十三日讯　由于侵越战争越败越惨而陷于内外交困的美帝国主义，目前正在勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，利用新近召开的第二十二届联合国大会，对英雄的越南人民发动新的“和平攻势”，妄图诱迫他们接受“和谈”骗局，同时为美帝进一步扩大侵越战争准备舆论。
    美国代表戈德堡在联大二十一日会议上的演说透露了这一新阴谋。在他的演说里，充满了为美国侵越罪行辩解的强盗语言、廉价的“和平”词藻以及破烂不堪的“政治解决”方案，如“联合国干预”、“停炸”、“逐步降级”，直到“重新召开日内瓦会议”，等等。所有这些陈旧货色，本来早已为越南人民和世界革命人民所唾弃。然而，戈德堡这个美国侵越政策推销员，仍然在联合国大会上声嘶力竭地叫喊：“我们美国人知道一项公平交易的性质；谁都不必害怕同我们谈判。”
    戈德堡在兜售美国的各种“和谈”方案时，着重鼓吹所谓“重新召开日内瓦会议”的方案。他照例按照美国的强盗逻辑，回避了这样一个基本事实：美国派遣了近五十万侵略军，远涉重洋跑到南越去杀人放火，并且对越南民主共和国进行了两年多的狂轰滥炸和其他军事侵略，从而彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议。他恬不知耻地大谈什么以一九五四年和一九六二年的日内瓦协议作为“解决”越南问题的“基础”，并且把已被美国破坏无遗的日内瓦协议条款搬了出来，妄想借此来推动“和谈”，解脱美国侵略者在南越战场上的困境，实现美帝永久分裂越南和继续霸占南越的罪恶目的。
    所谓“重新召开日内瓦会议”的“方案”根本不是什么新鲜玩艺。但是值得注意的是，这是在美苏就越南问题进一步加紧勾结的背景下出笼的。戈德堡二十二日在联大会议上的又一次发言中，就露骨地表示，美国无论是玩弄“停炸诱和”的阴谋还是策划“重新召开日内瓦会议”的骗局，都指望着苏联方面的帮忙。同一天，他在一次电视谈话中，又公开呼吁苏修集团“以它的力量和影响”来帮助“实现（越南问题的）政治解决”，并且表示希望同苏修外长葛罗米柯为此“举行几次会谈”。
    戈德堡的这番话并非无的放矢。苏修本来就一直在千方百计地为美帝的种种“和谈”骗局效劳，特别是在今年六月苏修头目柯西金亲自跑到美国去同约翰逊举行葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后，不断有消息透露，苏修正在更加积极地帮助美帝推行诱迫越南人民投降的阴谋。
    在联合国大会开幕前，美苏更是串通一气，加紧策划新的一轮“和谈”骗局。九月十五日，回国“休假”多日的苏联驻美大使多勃雷宁刚刚返任，就立即同美国国务卿腊斯克会谈了越南等问题，为预定的腊斯克—葛罗米柯会谈作准备。同一天，苏联驻英公使瓦谢夫拜会了英国外交大臣布朗，据报道，也是会谈越南问题。二十一日，约翰逊亲自接见刚回国的美国驻苏大使汤普森，讨论了美苏间“一切悬而未决的问题”。据宣布，在联大开会期间，美苏等国外长即将举行一系列的紧张会谈，西方通讯社透露，越南问题和中东问题将是会谈的中心议题。
    环绕美苏的紧张勾结，美帝的其它一些仆从走卒，如联合国秘书长吴丹、英国首相威尔逊、加拿大总理皮尔逊、日本外相三木武夫，以及铁托叛徒集团等等，也在起劲地为所谓“重开日内瓦会议”的方案奔走鼓吹。
    但是，不管美帝苏修怎样精心策划，也不管吴丹之流多么卖力地鼓吹，美帝的“新的”“和谈”阴谋，在决心抗战到底的越南人民面前，是决不会得逞的。胡志明主席在最近给越南南方人民的一封信中，代表三千一百万越南人民明确而坚定地声明：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。”美帝、苏修勾结一起，压也罢，骗也罢，到头来只能使它们自己碰得头破血流！
