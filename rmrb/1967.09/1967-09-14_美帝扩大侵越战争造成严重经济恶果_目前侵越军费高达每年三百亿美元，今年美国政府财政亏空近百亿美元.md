The U.S. Empire's expansion of the Vietnam War has caused severe economic consequences. Currently, the military expenditure for the Vietnam War has reached $30 billion per year, and this year the U.S. government's fiscal deficit is nearly $10 billion.

Our correspondent reports: The escalation of the Vietnam War and the rapid increase in military spending have plunged the Johnson administration into increasingly severe financial difficulties, increasingly exposing the weakness of U.S. imperialism.

Seven years ago, the cost of the Vietnam War was only $3 billion per year. However, the current U.S. military expenditure in Vietnam has increased to $30 billion per year. The rapid increase in U.S. military spending in Vietnam has brought serious consequences to the U.S. economy, with the federal budget deficit surging. According to reports, the total budget deficit over the past seven years has exceeded $40 billion. By the end of June this year, the deficit for the 1967 fiscal year has reached $9.9 billion, the largest deficit in eight years. However, according to Johnson's own estimates, the deficit for next year will exceed $28 billion. Therefore, he had to announce on August 3 that the initial decision to increase taxes by 6% would be raised to 10%, and that the current automobile and telephone consumption taxes would be extended. However, Johnson's tax increase can at most increase U.S. revenue by $10 billion next year, and the federal budget will still face a deficit of $18 billion, which will continue to cause serious fiscal deficits and even more severe inflation.

Why doesn't the Johnson administration raise taxes more to finance its military spending in Vietnam and achieve a balanced budget? It's not that they don't want to do this; it's that they dare not. Since last autumn, the U.S. economy has been in a state of overproduction and has seen a decline. Industrial production from last December to this June has declined five times, with a decline of nearly 3%. The unemployment rate has increased from 3.5% to 4%. Corporate profits have declined in both the first and second quarters of this year. The deteriorating economic situation has forced the Johnson administration to repeatedly postpone the tax increase date. Johnson, on the one hand, is pressured by the enormous military spending in Vietnam and has to use tax increases to finance the military, but on the other hand, he fears that excessive tax increases will harm the shaky economy, leading to a serious economic downturn. Therefore, he has repeatedly hesitated and vacillated.

However, under the pressure of enormous military spending, the Johnson administration has had to curb inflation and reaffirmed at the beginning of this year that "restoring price stability" is one of the main tasks of the U.S. government. However, recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor show that the rate of price increases in the U.S. this year is 3.6%, an increase of 3.3% over last year.

The increase in military spending in Vietnam is also exacerbating the large outflow of U.S. gold and dollars. The U.S. international payments deficit for the first half of this year has reached $1.1 billion, approaching last year's deficit of $1.4 billion. Treasury Secretary Fowler admits that "the situation may worsen in the second half of the year." He said, "The Vietnam problem is an important reason for the deterioration of the U.S. international payments situation. The U.S. now spends approximately $1.3 billion annually in Asia to purchase oil, cement, steel, grain, and other supplies used in the war."

Obviously, as long as the Vietnam War does not stop, the U.S. ruling authorities will not be able to balance their international payments and plug the leaks in the outflow of gold and dollars. This will inevitably lead to further loss of confidence in the dollar, making it even more difficult for the U.S. to maintain its position as the financial hegemon in the capitalist world.

    美帝扩大侵越战争造成严重经济恶果
    目前侵越军费高达每年三百亿美元，今年美国政府财政亏空近百亿美元
    本报讯　侵越战争不断“升级”和侵越军费迅速增长，使约翰逊政府陷入越来越大的财政困难，日益暴露了美帝国主义的虚弱本质。
    七年前，美国侵越战费一年不过三亿美元，但是目前美国侵略越南的军费已增加到一年三百亿美元，美国侵越军费的急剧增加，给美国财政带来了严重恶果，联邦预算赤字大增。据报道，七年来的预算赤字总额已超过了四百亿美元。今年六月底为止的一九六七财政年度的亏空，高达九十九亿美元，为八年以来最大的赤字。但是，根据约翰逊自己的估计，明年的赤字将超过二百八十亿美元。因此，他不得不于八月三日紧急宣布，把年初增税百分之六的决定，升级为百分之十，同时把现行的汽车和电话消费税加以延长。但是，约翰逊这次增税充其量只能使美国明年的财政收入增加一百亿美元，联邦预算还要出现一百八十亿美元的惊人赤字，这就仍然要造成严重的财政亏空和更加惊人的通货膨胀。
    约翰逊政府为什么不以更大的增税来筹措它的侵越军费并求得预算的平衡呢？这倒不是因为它不想这样做，而是因为它不敢这样做。从去年秋天起，美国经济由于生产“过剩”，又出现下跌。工业生产从去年十二月到今年六月连续下跌了五次，下跌幅度近百分之三。失业人数的比例从百分之三点五增加到百分之四。公司利润在今年第一季和第二季都连续下降。经济情况的不妙，使约翰逊政府不得不一再推迟增税日期。约翰逊一方面迫于侵越军费的庞大，不得不用增税来筹措军费，另一方面又害怕过大的增税会伤及摇摇欲坠的经济，导致一场严重的经济下跌，因此不得不一再犹豫、踌躇。
    但是，在庞大军费压力下，约翰逊政府不得不遏止通货膨胀，于今年年初重申把“恢复物价稳定”列为美国政府当前的主要任务之一。可是，最近，美国劳工部的统计表明，今年美国物价上涨速度是百分之三点六，又比去年增长百分之三点三。
    侵越军费的增大也在加剧着美国黄金和美元的大量外流。今年上半年的美国国际收支亏空达到十一亿美元，接近于去年的十四亿美元的亏空。财政部长福勒承认，“下半年同样可能恶化”。他说，“越南问题是（美国）国际收支情况恶化的一个重要原因。美国现在每年在亚洲花费大约十三亿美元来购买石油、水泥、钢、粮食和用于战争的其他供应品”。
    显然，侵越战争一天不停止，美国统治当局就一天不能平衡它的国际收支，堵塞它的黄金和美元外流的漏洞。这就必然会使美元的信用更加丧失，从而使美国在资本主义世界的金融霸主地位更加不能保持。
