In the Soviet Union under the rule of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, today's broad masses of laboring youth, like the workers and peasants, are suffering cruel oppression and exploitation at the hands of the privileged class.

The traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin shamelessly proclaim that they are "building communism," and that "caring for people" and "improving people's welfare" are their "sacred tasks," and so on. But the iron facts show that they are thoroughly restoring capitalism in every sphere of Soviet society.

Recently, a young woman from Penza, Shura Yegornikova, wrote a letter angrily denouncing the persecution she suffered at the hands of the new capitalists fostered by the Soviet revisionist leadership. Yegornikova's plight is by no means an isolated or accidental phenomenon; it reflects the fate of "tens of thousands of young men and women" in the Soviet Union today.

Yegornikova said: "In June 1966, after graduating from a commercial school, I began my working life at the 10th Commercial Store in Penza City... From July, money began to run short. The store manager thought I was a bold and restless girl. She often scolded me and threatened to fire me. Later, the shortages here became more and more frequent... and I couldn't understand the trickery here... because I hadn't seen the delivery notes even once; the manager told me the weight of the incoming goods. But the shortages increased during sales. The last time, when I received my advance pay, the manager said: 'Hey, can't you give us some money from your advance pay? You owe us a lot of money.'...

"On February 28, I paid the small change. I was still short 35 rubles—the price of two boxes of dried peaches. The manager said: 'You took the money. It was you.' But I never took any money. And she almost always said this... Finally, she warned: 'You owe 210 rubles.' I silently walked back to my residence. Tears of grievance choked me: where could I get so much money to pay? After all, my entire salary—55 rubles—I hardly ever saw. The rent was overdue because I had no money to pay. No one helped me. My mother and we five people together. So I decided—it's better to die."

Yegornikova, driven to desperation, attempted suicide and was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. She vowed that she would never return to the store.

In the eyes of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, which is restoring capitalism, this is entirely in line with their policy of "money first," "profit first," and turning workers into wage slaves under the "new system." In their view, a manager who knows how to squeeze every last ruble out of young sales clerks is a "talented expert." They are further strengthening the privileges of the privileged class.

However, the reactionary policies of the Soviet revisionist leadership at home are accelerating the awakening of Soviet youth and the broad masses. In the denunciations of many Soviet youths, a tremendous force of resistance is already brewing. In the history of the Soviet revolution, youth have written brilliant pages. In the struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of the new tsars in the Kremlin, Soviet revolutionary youth will certainly make new contributions.

    特权阶层胡作非为　劳动青年备受迫害
    苏联青年愤怒控诉苏修新沙皇
    据新华社讯　莫斯科消息：在勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团统治下的苏联，今天广大劳动青年同工农群众一样，受着特权阶层的残酷压迫和剥削。
    叛徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，恬不知耻地叫嚷他们在“建设共产主义”，把“关心人”和“提高人们的福利”作为“神圣的任务”等等。但是铁的事实表明，他们是在苏联社会的各领域内彻头彻尾地复辟资本主义。
    苏联奔萨市女青年舒拉·叶戈尔尼科娃，不久前写信愤怒控诉在苏修领导集团扶植下的新资本家对她的迫害。叶戈尔尼科娃的困难处境，绝不是个别的或偶然的现象，而是反映了苏联今天“成千上万的男女青年的命运”。
    叶戈尔尼科娃说：“一九六六年六月我从商业学校毕业后，在奔萨市第十商店开始了劳动生涯……从七月份起，钱开始经常少。商店经理认为我是一个胆子大和不安分的女孩子。她经常骂我，并扬言要把我赶走。以后，我这儿缺款现象越来越多……而我是不能理解这里的骗局的……因为提货单我没有看过一眼，经理把来货重量告诉我。但是在销货时缺款越来越多。最后一次，当我领到预支的钱时，经理说：“喂，你能不能从预支款里给我们些钱呢？你欠了好多钱了。”……
    “二月二十八日我还了零头。我又缺三十五卢布—两箱桃脯的价钱。经理说：‘是你拿了钱了。是你。’但是，我从未拿过钱。而她几乎每次都这样说……最后她警告说：‘你欠了二百一十卢布了。’“我默默地走回住所。由于委屈，泪水噎住了我：我到哪里去弄这么多钱来付款？要知道，我全部的薪金——五十五卢布——我几乎没看见过。房租欠着，因为我没钱付。没有任何人给我援助。妈妈和我们共五口人。于是我索性决定——最好一死。”
    叶戈尔尼科娃被逼得无法生活而自杀后，被送到医院急救脱险。她起誓，无论如何再也不回商店去了。
    在复辟资本主义的勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团看来，这完全合乎他们推行的“卢布挂帅”、“利润第一”，把职工沦为雇佣奴隶的“新体制”。在他们的眼中，善于千方百计敲榨勒索青年售货员的经理倒是“有才能的专家”。他们正在进一步加强特权阶层的“权限”。
    但是，苏修领导集团在国内的倒行逆施，正在加速苏联青年和广大群众的觉醒。在苏联许多青年的控诉声中，已经蕴藏着一股巨大的反抗力量。在苏联革命史上，青年曾写下光辉的篇页。在摧毁克里姆林宫新沙皇反动统治的斗争中，苏联革命青年也必将作出新的贡献。
