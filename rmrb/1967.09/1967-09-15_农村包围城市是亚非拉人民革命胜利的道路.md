The Chinese Khrushchev vehemently denies Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on surrounding the cities from the countryside. He is so audacious that he openly spreads the idea to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America that "whether the revolution's victory comes from the cities to the countryside or from the countryside to the cities, the result is the same. This is not a matter of principle."

This is sheer nonsense!

Twenty-nine years ago, Chairman Mao analyzed the social characteristics of old China and clearly pointed out: "Here, the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter into insurrection and war through long-term legal struggles, nor is it to first seize the cities and then the countryside. Instead, it is to take the opposite path."

On this fundamental issue of the road to take, the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in sharp struggle with the right and "left" opportunist lines. During the First Civil War, the right opportunist Chen Duxiu opposed mobilizing the peasants and arming them; during the Second Civil War, the "left" opportunist Wang Ming opposed establishing revolutionary base areas in the countryside and fantasized about quickly seizing major cities to achieve national revolutionary victory. The result was that the revolution suffered serious setbacks. Only under Chairman Mao's correct leadership did the Chinese revolution advance from victory to victory, ultimately achieving national liberation. History has ruthlessly declared the complete failure of the opportunist line. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev still says that "this is not a matter of principle" and "the result is the same," which is obviously a malicious and shameless lie.

The path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power by force, pioneered by Chairman Mao, is the only correct path that led to the victory of the Chinese revolution. It is also a brilliant path for the proletariat and all oppressed peoples and nations worldwide to strive for liberation. It has universal and practical significance for the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The living struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America vividly prove the immense power of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on surrounding the cities from the countryside. The armed struggles of the people in South Vietnam and Laos, by following Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on surrounding the cities from the countryside, arming the peasants, establishing base areas, and implementing the strategy and tactics of people's war, have achieved great victories; the peoples of countries like Burma and Thailand, by advancing along the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside, have also made significant progress in their revolutionary struggles. In the face of the surging and powerful armed struggles of the peoples of various countries, the Chinese Khrushchev's hysterical screams against Chairman Mao's thought on surrounding the cities from the countryside are nothing but the pitiful wails of a fly.

The Chinese Khrushchev's opposition to surrounding the cities from the countryside has deep historical roots. As early as the Second Civil War, he openly advocated "avoiding or reducing the bloody means of peasants directly seizing land," brazenly opposing the arming of peasants and peasant wars. He has always stubbornly opposed the establishment of rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside. After the victory of the Chinese revolution shattered his opportunist schemes, he shamelessly peddled his black goods internationally.

The essence and crux of the Chinese Khrushchev's opposition to surrounding the cities from the countryside is fundamentally opposing the seizure of power by force.

Chairman Mao's propositions on surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power by force are closely linked. Only by arming the peasants, establishing solid rural base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside can one achieve victory in armed struggles and victory in the national democratic revolution. Today, if the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America do not take this revolutionary path, they will inevitably lead to the failure of the revolution.

The liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations worldwide are advancing to victory along the path indicated by Chairman Mao! Let the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies go to hell!

    农村包围城市是亚非拉人民革命胜利的道路	山红
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力否定毛主席关于农村包围城市的光辉思想。他贼胆包天，竟公然对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民散布说：“革命的胜利是从城市到农村，还是从农村到城市，其结果都是一样，这不是原则问题。”
    完全是胡说八道！
    毛主席在二十九年前分析旧中国的社会特点时，就明确指出：“在这里，共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”
    在这个根本道路问题上，以毛主席为代表的革命路线同“左”、右倾机会主义路线一直进行着尖锐的斗争。在第一次国内革命战争时期，陈独秀右倾机会主义者反对发动农民和武装农民；在第二次国内革命战争时期，王明“左”倾机会主义者反对在农村建立革命根据地，幻想迅速夺取大城市取得全国革命胜利，其结果都使革命遭到了严重挫折。而只有在毛主席的正确路线指引下，中国革命才从胜利走向胜利，最后取得了全国的解放。历史无情地宣告了机会主义路线的彻底破产。而中国赫鲁晓夫却仍然说什么“这不是什么原则问题”，“其结果都是一样”，这显然是别有用心的无耻谰言。
    毛主席开创的农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路，是中国革命之所以能取得胜利的唯一正确道路，也是全世界无产阶级和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族争取解放的光辉道路。它对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族和被压迫人民，更是具有普遍的现实意义。
    亚、非、拉地区活生生的斗争现实无比雄辩地证明了毛主席关于农村包围城市的光辉思想具有无穷的威力。越南南方和老挝人民的武装斗争，由于按照毛主席关于农村包围城市的光辉思想，武装了农民，建立了根据地，实行了人民战争的战略战术，取得了巨大的胜利；缅甸、泰国等国人民，也由于沿着农村包围城市的革命道路前进，使革命斗争获得了很大的发展。在波澜壮阔、汹涌澎湃的各国人民胜利的武装斗争面前，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席关于农村包围城市的歇斯底里狂叫，不过是苍蝇的几声凄厉的抽泣而已。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对农村包围城市是有其深远的历史根源的。远在第二次国内革命战争时期，他就曾经公开宣扬，要“避免或减少农民直接夺取土地之流血的手段”，明目张胆地反对武装农民和农民战争，他始终顽固地反对建立农村根据地和以农村包围城市。当中国革命的胜利粉碎了他这一套机会主义货色之后，他又恬不知耻地在国际上兜售他的黑货。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对农村包围城市的实质和要害，是从根本上反对武装夺取政权。
    毛主席提出的关于农村包围城市和武装夺取政权这两个问题是紧密联系在一起的。只有武装农民，建立巩固的农村根据地，以农村包围城市，才能取得武装斗争的胜利，取得民族民主革命的胜利。今天，亚、非、拉革命人民如果不走这条革命道路，就必然导致革命的失败。
    全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放斗争正沿着毛主席所指引的道路胜利前进！让中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论统统见鬼去吧！
