Nguyen Minh Huong, acting head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam resident in China, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists today. He introduced the political program adopted by the extraordinary conference of the National Liberation Front and stated that the people of South Vietnam are determined to fight American imperialism to the end and achieve final victory.

In his speech, Nguyen Minh Huong first expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for their support for the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. He also thanked Premier Zhou Enlai for receiving him on September 4. Nguyen Minh Huong said that during this reception, Premier Zhou Enlai once again expressed the sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China for the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people under the leadership of the National Liberation Front. We highly appreciate this sympathy and support and regard it as a great encouragement to the South Vietnamese people.

Nguyen Minh Huong pointed out that the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a sign of new progress in the liberation war of the South Vietnamese people. It reflects the urgent desire of the South Vietnamese people to fight against the American invaders and their lackeys. Nguyen Minh Huong said that this program once again affirms the political tasks and national salvation goals of the South Vietnamese people: to strengthen national unity, decisively defeat the imperialist aggression of American imperialism, overthrow the puppet regime of the American imperialists, establish a broad national democratic united government, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and ultimately reunite the country. Nguyen Minh Huong stated that the South Vietnamese people are determined to struggle to the end to realize the political program of the National Liberation Front.

At the press conference, Nguyen Minh Huong also introduced the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people in the war of resistance against American aggression. He strongly condemned the new escalation of the war by American imperialism and its "peace talks" deception. He said that although American imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it still refuses to give up its ambition to invade Vietnam. On the one hand, it intensifies the bombing of North Vietnam, and on the other hand, it sings the tune of "peace talks," holding so-called "presidential and parliamentary elections" in the South, attempting to maintain the forces of those traitors and reactionaries who bring disaster to the country, serving American imperialism's goal of strengthening and prolonging the war of aggression. Nguyen Minh Huong emphasized that no matter how brutal and cunning the plots of American imperialism are, they cannot make the South Vietnamese people yield or be deceived. The South Vietnamese people will always adhere to their just position, endure any sacrifice, and face any hardship, determined to fight to the end and defeat the aggressive war of American imperialism.

　　阮明芳代理团长在中外记者招待会上重申
　　越南南方人民坚决战斗到底打败美帝
　　感谢中国人民对南越人民抗美救国战争的支持
    新华社五日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳今天举行中外记者招待会，介绍越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议通过的解放阵线的政治纲领，表示越南南方人民坚决同美帝国主义战斗到底，直到取得最后的胜利。
    阮明芳代理团长在讲话中首先表示感谢中国人民对越南南方人民抗美救国战争的支持，感谢周恩来总理九月四日对他的接见。阮明芳说，周恩来总理在这次接见中，对越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的领导下进行的正义斗争，再一次表达了中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的同情和支持。我们高度评价这种同情和支持，并把它看作是对越南南方人民的巨大鼓舞力量。
    阮明芳指出，越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领，是越南南方人民在解放战争道路上取得新的进展的标志，它反映了越南南方人民决心为反对美国侵略者及其走狗而战斗的迫切愿望。阮明芳说，这个纲领再一次肯定越南南方人民的政治任务和救国目标，是加强全民团结，坚决打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻美帝的走狗伪政权，成立广泛的民族民主联合政权，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而统一祖国。阮明芳表示，越南南方人民决心为实现民族解放阵线的政治纲领而奋斗到底。
    阮明芳在记者招待会上还介绍了越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。并且强烈谴责美帝国主义进行新的战争“升级”以及玩弄“和谈”骗局。他说，目前，美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨重的失败，但是，仍然不肯放弃侵略越南的野心。它一方面加紧轰炸越南北方，另一方面却高唱“和平谈判”的滥调，在南方进行所谓“总统、议院选举”，企图维持那些祸国殃民的卖国贼和反动派的势力，为美帝加强和延长侵略战争服务。阮明芳强调指出，不管美帝国主义的阴谋手段如何残暴狡猾，都无法使越南南方人民屈服和受蒙骗。越南南方人民始终坚持自己的正义立场，不管承担多大的牺牲，经受何等的艰苦，坚决战斗到底，打败美帝国主义的侵略战争。
