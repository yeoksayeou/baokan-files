About two hundred students from North Bengal University recently surrounded a police escort squad in India and rescued thirteen leaders of the Nasalbari movement from the police.

The report said that when a police escort squad led by officials from the Siliguri district was taking the thirteen arrested leaders of the Nasalbari uprising to Siliguri, these students surrounded them and rescued all the leaders being escorted by the police. The students also ordered the police to release another leader who had been arrested earlier by the reactionary government and subjected to severe torture. They took three policemen as hostages. They said that the authorities would have to return another leader to them before they would release these three policemen.

    印度北孟加拉学生包围警察押送队英勇救出革命者
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十六日电　据卡拉奇《每日新闻》引用西里古里消息报道：印度北孟加拉大学的约两百名大学生，最近包围了印度警察押送队，从警察手中营救了十三名纳萨尔巴里运动的领导人。
    消息说，当一支由西里古里大区官员带领的警察押送队，正在把被逮捕的十三名纳萨尔巴里起义领导人押往西里古里时，这些大学生包围了他们，并从警察押送队中营救了全部被押送的领导人。大学生还命令警察把早些时候被反动政府抓走并遭到严刑拷打的另一个领导人释放出来。他们带走了三名警察作为人质。他们说，官方把另一个领导人交还他们，他们才释放这三名警察。
