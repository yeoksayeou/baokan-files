The head of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, Brezhnev, recently rushed to Hungary and let out a frenzied anti-China howl at the so-called "Sino-Soviet Friendship Conference." He gnashed his teeth and cursed our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as "counter-revolutionary," viciously attacking the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and even crying for the fallen counter-revolutionary revisionists in China.

Brezhnev's hysterical outburst precisely proves that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has struck a painful blow to this gang of traitors, arousing their deep hatred and extreme panic.

Brezhnev and his ilk are thorough counter-revolutionaries. These traitors see things completely opposite to revolutionary people. They call counter-revolution "revolution," so naturally, they call revolution "counter-revolution." Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great innovation in the socialist revolution and the international communist movement, making the revolutionary people of the world rejoice. Only a small clique of imperialists, reactionaries, and shameful traitors of Marxism-Leninism hate and curse China's Cultural Revolution to death. Brezhnev's slander of this unprecedented great revolution as "counter-revolutionary" is a blatant confession of a great traitor.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." The Chinese Khrushchevs have been exposed, eliminating the biggest hidden danger within the Party, ensuring that the socialist state remains unchanged. This is a great joy for the Chinese people and the people of the world. However, Brezhnev refers to the fallen counter-revolutionary revisionists in China as "outstanding representatives" and "distinguished activists" of the Party and the state, crying and mourning for these fallen villains. This is truly a case of "mourning for the dead rabbit." Brezhnev's ugly performance once again reveals an open secret: the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China are kin to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, birds of a feather.

All reactionaries, the closer they are to their doom, the more frantically they struggle. The victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is something that domestic and foreign class enemies cannot accept. Brezhnev openly incites the fallen counter-revolutionary revisionists in China to "regain their strength" and rise again. This is a case of the thief crying "stop thief." However, these traitors are merely dreaming in broad daylight. The surging tide of China's Cultural Revolution will sweep away anyone who tries to block the historical current, leading them to their doom.

All traitors in the history of the international communist movement always direct their attacks at the revolutionary leaders of the world proletariat and the authority of proletarian revolutionary thought. The contemporary great traitor of the international communist movement, Brezhnev, is no exception. He attacks the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Mao Zedong, with a hundredfold hatred and a thousandfold frenzy, attacking the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is a necessary phenomenon of class struggle. However, the traitors' howls do not diminish the sun's brilliance. Under the invincible sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, all demons and pests hiding in the dark corners will be exposed and hasten their own death.

Why did Brezhnev rush to Hungary to put on this anti-China show? In a word, it is because China's Cultural Revolution has shaken the "throne" of the Soviet revisionist leadership and their lackeys; it is because the Soviet revisionist ruling clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin is in dire straits both domestically and internationally; it is to cooperate with the anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China global conspiracy of the United States and the Soviet Union. Brezhnev's bare-chested anti-China performance is an attempt to divert the attention of the Soviet people, resist the profound influence of China's Cultural Revolution, maintain the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, boost the morale of their followers, and serve the most vicious enemy of the world's people, American imperialism. Amidst the anti-China clamor, the likes of Kadar follow their master's lead, cheering and shouting. The Soviet revisionist leadership and their followers, singing and dancing together, are stirring up anti-China waves.

Well! If these anti-China "heroes" still want to perform, let them perform. History is ruthless. The more fiercely someone opposes China, the faster they will fall. This has been proven time and again. Brezhnev's anti-China howls are nothing but a funeral dirge they sing for themselves as they head to the grave.

    勃列日涅夫的反华嚎叫	本报评论员
    苏修叛徒集团头目勃列日涅夫，最近跑到匈牙利，在所谓“苏匈友好大会”上，发出了一阵疯狂的反华嚎叫。他咬牙切齿地咒骂我国无产阶级文化大革命是“反革命”，恶毒地攻击光焰无际的毛泽东思想，并且为被打倒了的中国的反革命修正主义分子鸣冤叫屈。
    勃列日涅夫这样歇斯底里大发作，恰恰证明了我国无产阶级文化大革命狠狠地戳痛了这伙叛徒，引起了他们的刻骨仇恨和极端恐慌。
    勃列日涅夫之流，是彻头彻尾的反革命。这伙叛徒看问题，同革命人民看问题，完全是相反的。他们把反革命叫做“革命”，当然就把革命叫做“反革命”。我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义革命和国际共产主义运动的伟大创举，全世界革命人民为之欢欣鼓舞。只有一小撮帝国主义、反动派和马克思列宁主义的可耻的叛徒，才对中国文化大革命恨得要命，破口大骂。勃列日涅夫把这场史无前例的大革命诬之为“反革命”，这正是大叛徒的赤裸裸的自白。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”中国的赫鲁晓夫们被揪了出来，除掉了埋藏在党内的最大的隐患，保证社会主义的江山不变颜色，这是中国人民和世界人民的大喜事。勃列日涅夫却把中国的反革命修正主义分子称之为党和国家的什么“优秀代表”、“杰出的活动家”，为这些被打倒了的坏家伙痛哭、致哀、吊丧。这真是兔死狐悲。勃列日涅夫的这一丑恶的表演，又一次道破了一个公开的秘密：中国的反革命修正主义分子同苏修叛徒集团是一家人，是一路货。
    一切反动派越是接近灭亡，就越是要作疯狂的挣扎。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是国内外阶级敌人绝对不甘心的。勃列日涅夫公然煽动中国的反革命修正主义分子重新“找到力量”，东山再起。真是贼心不死。然而，这伙叛徒不过是在白日做梦。中国文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，一切企图阻止历史潮流的人，都只能遭到灭顶之灾。
    国际共产主义运动历史上的一切叛徒，总是把攻击的矛头集中到世界无产阶级的革命导师，集中到无产阶级革命思想的权威。当代国际共产主义运动的大叛徒勃列日涅夫当然不会例外。他以百倍的仇恨、千倍的疯狂攻击中国人民和世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想，这是阶级斗争的必然现象。但是，叛徒的狂叫，丝毫无损于太阳的光辉。在威力无比的毛泽东思想阳光下，一切隐藏在阴暗角落里的妖魔鬼怪，苍蝇臭虫，都会暴露出原形，加速自己的死亡。
    勃列日涅夫急急忙忙跑到匈牙利做了这样一番反华表演，到底是为什么呢？说穿了，是由于中国的文化大革命震动了苏修领导集团及其娄罗们的“宝座”；是由于以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修统治集团正处于内外交困，日子很不好过；是由于为了配合美苏葛拉斯堡罗反共、反人民、反华的反革命全球大勾结。勃列日涅夫再一次赤膊上阵，大肆反华，是企图借此转移苏联人民的视线，抵制中国文化大革命的深远影响，维护苏修领导集团的反动统治，给他们的追随者打气，并且为世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义效劳。在这反华的喧嚣声中，卡达尔之流跟在主子后面，亦步亦趋，摇旗呐喊。苏修领导集团及其追随者有唱有和，兴风作浪，正在极力掀动反华逆流。
    好吧！你们这些反华的“英雄”既然还要表演，那就表演下去吧。历史是无情的。任何人反华越凶，垮台也就越快。这已是屡经证明了的真理。勃列日涅夫之流的反华嚎叫，不过是他们为自己走向坟墓而唱的一支送葬曲而已。
