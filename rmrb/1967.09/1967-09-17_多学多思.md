At a crucial juncture in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a highly significant speech by a responsible comrade of the Party Central Committee and the important article "On the Two Books by Tao Zhu" by Comrade Yao Wenyuan have great guiding significance for fully carrying out Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Revolutionary Red Guards must sit down and study seriously, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out these instructions. This is the key to ensuring that we steadfastly advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao. We must always remember Comrade Lin Biao's teaching: "We must always pay attention to and care about political situations, policies, and line-oriented issues, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and avoid wavering and losing our way in the face of major issues."

What should guide our analysis of the situation?

Comrade Lenin clearly pointed out: "Marxism has given us a basic thread that enables us to find regularity in what appears to be a state of confusion. This thread is the theory of class struggle." This means that we must use Mao Zedong Thought and the method of class analysis to observe and analyze everything in order to draw correct conclusions. Some comrades also analyze things, but they forget this fundamental point. In the face of complex and sharp class struggles, they do not use Mao Zedong Thought and the perspective of class struggle as the core of analyzing everything. They do not combine revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, nor do they adopt a serious attitude of high responsibility towards the revolution to investigate and analyze the situation. Instead, they are not interested in studying the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions. At the slightest sign of trouble, they run around here and there, believing in and being swayed by things they happen to hear or see on the streets, making hasty conclusions without thinking. In this way, they cannot grasp the essence and mainstream of things and will make wrong judgments or adopt wrong policies. To these comrades, we earnestly hope: stop these sneaky activities and sit down to study seriously! Only by relying on the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee can we correctly analyze the situation, dispel the fog, and see the direction. Without Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will become politically shortsighted and blind, straying from the path and falling hard.

How do we overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism? What should we use to overcome it? How can we overcome it? The most important thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves. Mao Zedong Thought can enhance our understanding of the future and direction, broaden our horizons, and liberate our thoughts from narrow confines. Mao Zedong Thought can help us look forward instead of backward and help us see problems comprehensively and objectively rather than one-sidedly and subjectively.

Is it about truly understanding Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in terms of ideology? This is a major issue directly related to whether we develop petty-bourgeois factionalism or overcome it. Without seriously understanding Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, we will not use Chairman Mao's strategic deployment to guide our actions; we will often adopt a pragmatic attitude towards the instructions of the proletarian headquarters, supporting and executing what is beneficial to our small groups and factions; conversely, we will be in low spirits and passive. They regard the maintenance of the interests of small groups and factions as more important than the maintenance of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; they regard the future of small groups and factions as more important than the development of the Cultural Revolution. If this continues, there is a possibility of being used by class enemies, even doing things that hurt friends and please enemies.

Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guiding ideology of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The correct political direction can only come from Mao Zedong Thought. What attitude to take towards Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is a major issue of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a major issue of whether the proletarian revolutionary forces can continue to advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao in the new situation. Especially at this crucial juncture of the Cultural Revolution, the primary issue for the proletarian revolutionary forces to focus on is Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and the spirit of the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We must be good at learning and good at thinking. We must highly unite revolutionary spirit with scientific spirit.

    在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，党中央的负责同志最近作的极为重要的讲话，以及姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》，对当前全面贯彻毛主席的伟大战略部署具有重大的指导意义。革命的红卫兵小将要坐下来认真学习，深刻领会，坚决贯彻，这是保证我们能够坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进的关键。我们要牢记林彪同志的教导：“要时时刻刻关心和注意政治形势、政策、路线等方向性的问题，站稳立场，分清是非，避免在大是大非面前摇摆不定，迷失方向。”
    用什么来指导我们分析形势呢？
    列宁同志明确指出：“马克思主义给我们指出了一条基本线索，使我们能在这种看来迷离混沌的状态中找出规律性来。这条线索就是阶级斗争的理论。”这就是说，我们要用毛泽东思想，用阶级分析的方法，来观察和分析一切事物，才能得出正确的结论。有些同学也在那里分析来分析去，可恰恰忘了这个根本。他们在复杂尖锐的阶级斗争面前，不是用毛泽东思想、用阶级斗争的观点，作为分析一切事物的核心，不是把革命性和科学性紧紧地结合起来，不是本着对革命高度负责的严肃态度去调查研究，分析形势。而是对学习中央指示精神不感兴趣，一有风吹草动，便东串串，西走走，把凑巧碰到偶然听到的较为“公开地”叫喊的东西等等信以为真，被马路新闻左右，不加思索地做出“轻率”的结论。这样，就不可能抓住事物的本质和主流，就会作出错误的判断或采取错误的方针。对于这部分同学，我们热切地希望：停止这些探头探脑的活动，坐下来好好学习吧！只有依据毛主席、党中央的指示精神，才能正确地分析形势，拨开迷雾，认清方向。离开毛主席的伟大战略部署，就会变成政治上的近视和瞎子，误入歧途，跌大跟头。
    要克服小资产阶级的派性吗？用什么来克服呢？怎样才能克服掉呢？最重要的是用毛泽东思想改造自己。毛泽东思想可以提高我们对前途和方向的认识，开阔我们的眼界，使我们的思想从狭隘的范围解放出来。毛泽东思想能够帮助我们朝前看而不是朝后看，帮助我们全面地、客观地看问题而不是片面地、主观地看问题。
    是不是从思想上对毛主席的伟大战略部署真正理解了，这是直接关系到是发展小资产阶级派性还是克服小资产阶级派性的重大问题。不认真体会毛主席的战略部署，就不会用毛主席的战略部署统帅自己的行动；就往往会用实用主义的态度来对待无产阶级司令部的指示，认为对自己的小团体、小派别有利的就拥护，就执行；反之，则情绪低落，消极厌倦。他们把关心维护小团体、小派别的利益看得比维护毛主席的伟大战略部署还重要；把小团体、小派别的出路看得比文化大革命的发展还重要。这样下去，就有可能被阶级敌人所利用，以至做出使亲者痛、仇者快的事来。
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命唯一正确的指导思想。正确的政治方向，只能从毛泽东思想来。对毛主席伟大战略部署采取什么态度，是忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题，是关系到无产阶级革命派在新形势下，能否继续沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进的大问题。尤其在目前文化大革命已发展到重要关头，无产阶级革命派集中思考的问题，首先是毛主席的战略部署，首先是领会毛主席、党中央的指示精神。要善于学习，善于多思。要把革命气概与科学精神高度地统一起来。
