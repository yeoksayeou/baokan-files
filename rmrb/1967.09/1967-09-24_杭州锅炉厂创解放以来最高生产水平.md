On the eve of National Day, Hangzhou Boiler Factory reported a production triumph: boiler production volume reached an all-time high since liberation, and the number of new products was the highest in a single year since liberation. From January to August, the factory's production continued to rise month by month, with production plans exceeded in every quarter. Product quality has also significantly improved. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses criticized the reactionary "authorities" and their capitalist and revisionist junk. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," concentrated the wisdom of the masses, overcame various difficulties, and successfully designed and manufactured five different types of coal-saving, lightweight, quick-installation boilers. These boilers consume less coal and are easy to install. Previously produced boilers took three to six months to install before they could be used at the receiving units. These new boilers can be put into use in just six to seven days.

    杭州锅炉厂创解放以来最高生产水平
    国庆节前夕，杭州锅炉厂传出生产捷报：锅炉生产产量创造了解放以来的最高纪录，新产品数量也是解放以来最多的一年。从一月到八月，这个工厂的生产逐月上升，生产计划季季超额完成。产品质量也有显著提高。在文化大革命运动中，无产阶级革命派批判了反动“权威”的资本主义、修正主义黑货，他们认真学习毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大指示，集中群众的智慧，克服种种困难，设计和试制成功了五种不同型号的省煤、轻型快装锅炉。这种锅炉耗煤量小，安装方便。过去生产的锅炉，送到使用单位要安装三至六个月才能使用，这种锅炉只要安装六至七天就可以使用了。
