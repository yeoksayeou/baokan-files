War Educates the People, the People Will Win the War

Vietnamese Militia Grows Stronger in the Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation

Citizens and Soldiers in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Other Places Bravely Fight, Shooting Down 14 U.S. Aircraft

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on September 1, our correspondent reports: The Vietnamese militia self-defense forces have grown stronger and more numerous in the more than two years of fighting against U.S. aggression for national salvation. They have become an indispensable and important force in coordinating with the Vietnamese People's Army to destroy U.S. air pirates and sea bandits, as well as in various tasks serving the battle.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "On Coalition Government" on April 24, 1945, spoke of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, saying, "This army is powerful because it has a broad mass armed organization of self-defense forces and militias to coordinate and fight with it.... Without the coordination of these mass armed forces, it is impossible to defeat the enemy."

	During our correspondent's visit to North Vietnam, we saw that from the mountains to the islands, from the coastal areas to the interior, from cities to villages, there are militia self-defense positions everywhere. Wherever there are sounds of U.S. pirate planes, there are the sounds of militia self-defense gunfire.

	The militia self-defense forces not only coordinate with the air defense forces to form a low-altitude fire network, contributing to the shooting down of U.S. pirate planes, but also, in independent battles, have achieved brilliant victories. In the past two years, the militia self-defense forces have shot down hundreds of enemy planes, including fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, and helicopters. On June 16 this year, a female militia platoon in the rear of Thanh Hoa Province shot down a U.S. A-4 type pirate plane with just 27 bullets. In Quang Binh Province, Quang Tri District, Quang Long Commune, militias used French colonialist rifles captured during the anti-French war, shooting down a U.S. F-105 type pirate plane with 12 bullets. In addition, the militia self-defense forces have made great contributions in assisting the artillery units in constructing fortifications, transporting shells, providing medical aid, and in capturing U.S. air pirates and ensuring transportation.

	To thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressor pirates, liberate the South, and unify the country, the broad ranks of militia self-defense forces are actively learning various military techniques, and their combat skills are constantly improving. Now, many militia self-defense forces can use anti-aircraft guns. The Fourth Military Region's militia self-defense forces have established artillery platoons, assisting the People's Army artillery in severely punishing U.S. sea bandits and U.S. aggressor forces south of the 17th parallel. In a certain commune in Ha Dong District, Hanoi, most of the militias are young women, all of whom have learned to operate anti-aircraft guns. Recently, whenever U.S. pirate planes attacked Hanoi, they would rush to the positions in time to assist the People's Army artillery units in battle. In a certain commune in Ninh Binh Province, 200 militia self-defense forces can serve as various types of gunners. In Quang Binh Province, two militia artillery platoons, together with other units, damaged a U.S. destroyer. Many militia artillery platoons in Quang Binh, Nghe An, and other provinces have also participated in many battles to shell U.S. sea bandits.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on September 1, it was announced here that on August 31, the military and people of North Vietnam shot down nine invading U.S. pirate planes, capturing many U.S. air pirates. Among them, the military and people of Haiphong shot down five planes, and the military and people of Hanoi shot down two planes. The military and people of Quang Binh Province and Hai Duong Province each shot down one plane.

	According to supplementary reports, the military and people of Quang Binh Province, Quang Binh District, Vinh Linh District, and Nghe An Province shot down a total of five enemy planes on August 27, 28, and 30.

	The Vietnamese People's Army artillery damaged a U.S. ship intruding into the waters of Quang Binh Province on August 27. (Accompanying photo)

　　战争教育了人民　人民将赢得战争
　　越南民兵在抗美救国斗争中成长壮大
　　河内海防等地军民英勇战斗击落美机十四架
    据新华社河内一日电  本社记者报道：越南北方民兵自卫队，在两年多的抗美救国战斗中，不断成长壮大。他们在配合越南人民军消灭美国空中强盗和海盗的战斗中，以及在为战斗服务的各项工作中，已经成为一支不可缺少的重要力量。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席一九四五年四月二十四日在《论联合政府》这部光辉著作中谈到八路军和新四军时指出，“这个军队之所以有力量，还由于有人民自卫军和民兵这样广大的群众武装组织，和它一道配合作战。……没有这些群众武装力量的配合，要战胜敌人是不可能的。”
    记者在越南北方采访时看到，从山区到海岛，从沿海地区到内地，从城市到乡村，到处都有民兵自卫队阵地。哪里有美国强盗飞机的声音，哪里就有民兵自卫队的枪声。
    民兵自卫队不仅配合防空部队组成低空火力网，为击落美国强盗飞机作出了贡献，而且在单独作战中，也立下了辉煌的战功。两年多来，民兵自卫队共击落包括战斗机、侦察机和直升飞机在内的成百架敌机。清化省后禄地方的女民兵中队，在今年六月十六日用二十七发子弹就击落美国A—4型强盗飞机一架。广平省广泽县广龙乡民兵使用在抗法战争时缴获的法国殖民者的步枪，以十二发子弹击落美国F—105型强盗飞机一架。此外，民兵自卫队在帮助高炮部队修筑工事、搬运炮弹、进行救护等方面，以及在搜捕美国飞贼和保证交通运输方面也作出了巨大的贡献。
    为了彻底战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，统一祖国，广大民兵自卫队员积极学习各种军事技术，战斗本领日益提高。现在，许多民兵自卫队员都能使用高射炮。第四联区的民兵自卫队还成立起炮兵分队，协助人民军炮兵狠狠惩罚美国海盗和在十七度线以南的美国侵略军。河内嘉林县某乡民兵，大部分是女青年，她们全都学会了操纵高射炮。最近，美国强盗飞机袭击河内时，她们每次都及时赶到阵地，协助人民军炮兵部队作战。宁平省某乡有二百名民兵自卫队员可以担任各种炮手。河静省两个民兵炮兵分队，同其他单位协同作战，击伤美国驱逐舰一艘。广平、义安等省的许多民兵炮兵分队，也曾多次参加炮击美国海盗的战斗。
    新华社河内一日电  据这里公布，越南北方军民八月三十一日击落入侵的美国强盗飞机九架，活捉美国飞贼多名，其中海防市军民击落五架，河内市军民击落两架，富寿省和海阳省军民各击落一架。
    据补充报道，河静省、广平省、永灵区和义安省军民在八月二十七日、二十八日和三十日共击落敌机五架。
