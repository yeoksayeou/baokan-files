We have heard the news that Chairman Mao has inspected the great situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the North China, Central South, and East China regions. We are truly excited and overjoyed! Words cannot express our boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao. Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal youth!"

Chairman Mao has once again gone deep into the masses to investigate the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, once again showing that he trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the masses' revolutionary movement the most. He is forever united with the broad revolutionary masses.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is an important strategic measure to prevent our socialist state from changing color. Now, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants in the Beijing suburbs are widely carrying out revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and have achieved great victories in eliminating the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Looking back, we deeply feel that at every critical moment in revolutionary history, Chairman Mao has always been concerned about what we are concerned about, thinking about what we are thinking about, leading us from victory to victory. Chairman Mao is forever the reddest red sun in our hearts.

Chairman Mao's inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the North China, Central South, and East China regions is the greatest encouragement and greatest spur for the workers, peasants, soldiers, and broad revolutionary masses across the country. It is the greatest impetus for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. We feel that Chairman Mao is also by our side, caring about our situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and kindly teaching us how to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely not disappoint your expectations. We will definitely seriously study and apply your works, resolutely carry out your instructions: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses, to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." We will definitely not become officials and lords, resolutely go among the masses, learn from the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, closely follow your great strategic deployment, widely and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job in revolutionary great alliance, revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units, grasp the revolution, promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　毛主席在我们身边
　　北京市农代会常设委员会核心组
    我们听到毛主席在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，视察了华北、中南和华东地区的喜讯，真是激动极了，兴奋极了！千言万语难以表达我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬爱，让我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：
  “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席又一次深入到群众中调查无产阶级文化大革命的情况，再一次说明他老人家最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，永远和广大革命群众心连心。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是防止我们社会主义江山改变颜色的重要战略措施。现在，北京郊区广大贫下中农，正在广泛地开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团猛烈开火，肃清反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒，已取得了很大胜利。回忆过去，我们深深感到，在每一个革命历史关头，毛主席都是急我们所急，想我们所想，领导我们从胜利走向胜利，毛主席永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区无产阶级文化大革命，这是对全国工农兵和广大革命群众的最大鼓舞，最大鞭策，是对全国无产阶级文化大革命的最大推动。我们感到毛主席就象也来到了我们身边，关心地询问我们无产阶级文化大革命的情况，亲切地教导我们怎样把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定不辜负您的期望，一定认真地活学活用您的著作，坚决执行您的指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”一定不当官做老爷，坚决深入群众，向广大贫下中农学习，和广大贫下中农一起，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，搞好革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”和本单位的斗批改，抓好革命，促好生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
