The path of Naxalbari is our path!” This is a correct conclusion drawn by Indian revolutionary peasants from their long history of struggle.

Since India declared “independence” twenty years ago, there have been three high tides of peasant movements. One was the large-scale armed struggle of peasants centered in the Telangana region that shook the whole of India. Another was the mass struggle of peasants against landlords seizing their land. The third was the mass struggle of peasants for land and against various oppressive taxes. Due to the brutal suppression of the reactionary regime and the betrayal of revisionist elements, all major peasant struggles in India have failed. However, “learning from failure,” more and more revolutionary peasants have learned from the history of past struggles.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” and “the experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of guns.”

The experience of multiple peasant revolutionary movements in Indian history can be summed up in one point: under the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary faction, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take the path of armed seizure of power and encircling the cities from the countryside. This is the key to determining the success or failure of the revolution. With revolutionary armed forces, there will be land for the peasants, rights for the peasants, and liberation for the peasants. Without revolutionary armed forces, there will be nothing for the peasants. Stopping armed struggle will result in the loss of all achievements of the peasant revolution.

The poor peasants in India engaging in mass struggles against landlord seizures, for land, and against oppressive taxes is entirely necessary. However, various forms of mass struggles must be combined with the overall struggle for armed seizure of power and must take armed struggle as the main form of struggle. Otherwise, it is impossible to fundamentally overthrow the feudal system and achieve the complete liberation of the peasants. The land revolution is a basic task of the current stage of the Indian new democratic revolution, and this revolution inevitably is an armed revolution of the peasants.

For thousands of years, both domestic and foreign ruling classes have always deceived the Indian laboring people, not allowing them to understand the necessity of taking up arms. Once the Indian workers and peasants become aware and take up arms, they must not put them down. The armed struggle of Telangana peasants was betrayed by Indian revisionists, which is a bloody lesson for the Indian people. Once revolutionary people who have taken the path of armed struggle put down their weapons, what follows will not be any “concessions” or “reforms” from the ruling class, but only savage suppression, bloody massacres, and mad counterattacks. In a word, it is the extremely cruel class revenge of the class enemy. Revolutionary armed struggle cannot be half-hearted; revolutionary people must overcome all difficulties, remain unyielding, and persist for a long time until final victory is achieved.

The history of the Indian peasant revolutionary movement proves that the Dange clique and other Indian revisionists are traitors who have consistently betrayed the Indian peasant revolution and are henchmen and running dogs serving the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie. These despicable and shameless individuals use every means to try to bring the peasant movement into the track of the revisionist political line of the “parliamentary road” and “peaceful transition.” When the peasant revolutionary struggle breaks through the barriers they set up, especially when the armed struggle of peasants threatens the reactionary rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, they use all their strength to sabotage the revolutionary movement, deceive revolutionary peasants into putting down their weapons and stopping armed struggle. The armed struggle of Telangana peasants was buried in this way. Now, they are also plotting against the armed struggle of Naxalbari peasants, attempting to extinguish this spark of revolution. The Indian proletarian revolutionary faction must heighten class vigilance a hundredfold and resolutely fight against the betrayal and sabotage of revisionist elements to advance and lead the peasant revolution to victory.

The Soviet revisionist clique and the Chinese Khrushchev have consistently advocated the “parliamentary road,” that is, the so-called “Indian road,” to prevent the Indian people and other oppressed nations and peoples from taking the path of victory of the Chinese revolution. All revolutionary peoples must thoroughly criticize and eliminate the poisonous influence of such counter-revolutionary fallacies propagated by the Soviet revisionist clique and the Chinese Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The road of revolution, like all other things and phenomena in the world, is tortuous and not straight.” “Certain setbacks in the revolutionary process and possible reverses can only be overcome through struggle and effort, and require long-term struggle and effort.”

The Indian peasant revolution is advancing through twists and turns. As long as the Indian proletarian revolutionary faction is good at summing up historical experience and advances along the path of armed seizure of power indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao, it will definitely be able to turn the armed struggle starting from Naxalbari into a surging revolutionary tide through long-term arduous struggle and effort, overthrow the sinister rule of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and achieve the thorough victory of the Indian new democratic revolution.

　　印度农民用鲜血换来的经验
　　本报评论员
    “纳萨尔巴里的道路就是我们的道路！”这是印度革命农民从长期斗争的历史经验中得出的一个正确结论。
    自从印度宣布“独立”二十年以来，出现过三次农民运动的高潮。一次是震动印度全国的以特仑甘纳地区为中心的大规模的农民武装斗争。另一次是农民反对地主夺佃的群众斗争。再一次是农民争取土地和反对苛捐杂税的群众斗争。由于反动政权的残酷镇压和修正主义分子的叛卖，印度农民的历次重大斗争都失败了。但是，“吃一堑长一智”，越来越多的革命农民从过去的斗争历史中学到了经验。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主”。
    印度历史上多次农民革命运动的经验，归结到一点，就是要在无产阶级革命派的领导下，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南，走武装夺取政权、农村包围城市的道路。这是决定革命成败的关键。有了革命的武装，就会有农民的土地，有农民的权利，有农民的解放。没有革命的武装，就没有农民的一切。停止武装斗争，就会丧失农民革命所取得的一切成果。
    印度贫苦的农民进行反夺佃、争取土地和减租抗税的群众斗争，是完全必要的。但是，各种形式的群众性斗争，必须同武装夺取政权的总斗争结合起来，必须以武装斗争为主要斗争形式。否则，想要从根本上推翻封建制度，取得农民的彻底解放，是不可能的。土地革命是现阶段印度新民主主义革命的一个基本任务，这个革命不可避免地是一场农民的武装革命。
    几千年来，本国和外国的统治阶级总是愚弄印度劳动人民，不让他们懂得拿起武器的必要性。一旦印度工农大众觉悟了，拿起了武器，就决不能放下武器。特仑甘纳农民武装斗争被印修分子所出卖，这对印度人民来说，是一个血的教训。已经走上武装斗争道路的革命人民，如果放下武器，接踵而来的，决不会是统治阶级的什么“让步”和“改革”，而只能是野蛮的镇压、血腥的屠杀和疯狂的反攻倒算。一句话，是阶级敌人的极其残酷的阶级报复。革命武装斗争决不能半途而废，革命人民一定要排除万难，不屈不挠，长期坚持下去，直到取得最后胜利。
    印度农民革命运动的历史证明，丹吉集团和其他印度修正主义分子，是一贯出卖印度农民革命的叛徒，是为印度大地主大资产阶级效劳的帮凶和走狗。这些卑鄙无耻的家伙，千方百计地要把农民运动纳入“议会道路”、“和平过渡”的修正主义政治路线的轨道。当着农民革命斗争冲破他们所设下的藩篱，特别是当农民武装斗争危及大地主大资产阶级的反动统治的时候，他们就用尽气力去破坏革命运动，诳骗革命农民放下武器和停止武装斗争。当年的特仑甘纳农民武装斗争，就是被他们这样葬送掉的。现在，他们又对纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争下毒手，企图扑灭这场革命的星星之火。印度的无产阶级革命派要把农民革命推向前进，引向胜利，就必须百倍提高阶级警惕性，同修正主义分子的叛卖和破坏进行坚决斗争。
    苏修叛徒集团和中国赫鲁晓夫，也一贯地宣扬“议会道路”，即所谓“印度道路”，借以阻止印度人民和其他被压迫民族和被压迫人民走中国革命胜利的道路。一切革命的人民，对苏修集团和中国赫鲁晓夫的这种反革命谬论，必须加以彻底批判，并肃清其流毒。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的道路，同世界上一切事物活动的道路一样，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。”“革命进程中的某些波折，以及可能的回头路，只有斗争和努力才能够克服，而且需要长期的斗争和努力。”
    印度的农民革命就是在曲折的斗争中前进的。印度的无产阶级革命派只要善于总结历史经验，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席所指引的武装夺取政权的道路前进，就一定能够通过长期艰苦的斗争和努力，把从纳萨尔巴里开始的武装斗争变成翻江倒海的革命洪流，推翻印度大地主大资产阶级的罪恶统治，取得印度新民主主义革命的彻底胜利。
