    The nature of dogs is not easily changed... If one thinks that after falling into the water, they are particularly pitiful, then among harmful creatures, the pitiful ones are numerous. Even cholera bacteria, although they reproduce quickly, have such an honest nature. However, doctors will never let them go.
