Bulgarian revolutionaries say: With Chairman Mao's leadership, we have hope

According to Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: Bulgarian revolutionary masses have an infinite love for the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, and they praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Once, a Bulgarian old Communist Party member saw a Chinese comrade wearing a shining gold Mao Chairman badge on his chest. He firmly grasped the Chinese comrade's hand and said, "I love Chairman Mao very much. Can you give me this badge?" The Chinese comrade gave the Mao Chairman badge to him. The old Communist Party member excitedly said, "We miss Chairman Mao very much. I am an old Communist Party member. During the period of German fascist rule, I shed blood for socialism. Now our party leaders have betrayed socialism. They are learning from capitalism and opening the door wide to the West, making our country completely different. As an old Communist Party member, seeing these phenomena, I feel very heartbroken."

He looked at the Mao Chairman badge and said, "Our hope lies with Comrade Mao Zedong. The Chinese people led by Mao Zedong adhere to Marxism-Leninism, and we have hope. Socialism will surely triumph in Bulgaria."

A Bulgarian old revolutionary often teaches his children, "Read Chairman Mao's books well. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He is not only the great teacher and leader of the Chinese people but also the great teacher and leader of the Bulgarian people." Under his guidance, the whole family reads Chairman Mao's books.

　　保加利亚革命者说：
　　有毛主席领导，我们就有了希望
    据新华社讯　索非亚消息：保加利亚革命群众无限热爱世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席和赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    有一次，保加利亚一位老共产党员看到中国同志胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，他用力地握着中国同志的手说：“我非常热爱毛主席，你能否将这枚像章转给我。”中国同志把毛主席像章送给了他。这位老共产党员激动地说：“我们很想念毛主席。我是一个老共产党员，在德国法西斯统治时期，我为了社会主义曾流过血。现在我们党的领导人背叛了社会主义，他们极力向资本主义学习，向西方大开方便之门，使我们的国家完全变了样。作为一个老共产党员，看到这些现象我感到很痛心。”
    他望着毛主席像章说：“我们的希望寄托在毛泽东同志身上。毛泽东同志领导的中国人民坚持马克思列宁主义，我们就有希望。社会主义早晚将会在保加利亚取得胜利。”
    一位保加利亚的老革命者经常教育自己的子女说：“要好好读毛主席的书。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他不仅是中国人民的伟大导师和领袖，也是我们保加利亚人民的伟大导师和领袖。”在他的教导下，全家人人都读毛主席的书。
