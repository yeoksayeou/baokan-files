Indian troops invaded our territory and provoked our border guards, injuring them. Our troops were forced to counterattack in self-defense, causing the Indian troops to flee in disarray. Our border defense forces are on high alert and ready to punish any invading Indian troops at any time.

	New Delhi, September 8 (Xinhua) — According to a report from our Tibet border defense forces, on September 7, Indian troops crossed the Sino-Indian border at the Natu La Pass, invaded our territory, set up barbed wire, and injured our border guards, engaging in military provocation.

	On September 7 at 8 AM, approximately sixty Indian troops invaded our territory by about ten meters and set up barbed wire. Our border defense forces immediately issued a warning, ordering them to withdraw. The Indian troops not only did not withdraw but also continued to reinforce their troops within their territory, attempting to provoke a larger-scale border incident. When we issued another warning, the invading Indian troops actually stabbed two of our border guards with bayonets. Our border guards were forced to counterattack in self-defense, causing the Indian troops to flee in disarray.

	In recent days, Indian troops at the Natu La Pass on the Sino-Indian border have repeatedly invaded our territory despite our repeated warnings, setting up iron stakes and barbed wire. On September 7, they even went so far as to invade our territory to forcibly set up barbed wire and stab our border guards. In response to the Indian troops' increasingly brazen military provocations, our border defense forces are on high alert and ready to give the Indian troops who dare to invade our territory the punishment they deserve at any time.

　　印军侵入我境内挑衅打伤我边防战士
　　我军被迫自卫反击　印军狼狈逃窜
　　我边防部队严阵以待随时准备惩罚来犯印军
    新华社拉萨八日电  据我西藏边防部队报告，九月七日印军越过中锡边界乃堆拉山口，侵入我境架设铁丝网，打伤我边防战士，进行军事挑衅。
    九月七日八时，印军六十余人，侵入我境十余米架设铁丝网。我边防部队当即提出警告，令其退出我境。印军不仅未退出境外，反而在其境内继续增兵，妄图挑起更大规模的边境事件。当我再次提出警告时，入侵印军竟用刺刀刺伤我边防战士两名。我边防战士被迫自卫反击，印军狼狈逃窜。
    最近以来，印军在中锡边境乃堆拉山口，不顾我方多次警告，接二连三地入侵我境，埋设铁桩，架设铁丝网。九月七日竟然发展到不仅侵入我境强行架设铁丝网，还刺伤我边防战士。对印军越来越多的猖狂的军事挑衅活动，我边防部队正严阵以待，并随时准备给予敢于侵犯我国领土的印军以应得的惩罚。
