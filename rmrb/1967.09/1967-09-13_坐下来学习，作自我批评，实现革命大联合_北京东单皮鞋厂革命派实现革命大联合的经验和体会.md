The revolutionary rebel corps of the Beijing Dongdan Leather Shoe Factory and the Red Rebel Corps, after jointly seizing power in January this year, split again within a month. The "internal war" lasted from February to May, and it was not until June that the two revolutionary organizations reunited, establishing a unified revolutionary organization for the entire factory, the "June 10th" Revolutionary Rebel Corps. They gained some important experiences and lessons in this process of unity, split, and reunification.

	Never Relax Self-Reform

The Revolutionary Rebel Corps and the Red Rebel Corps, after their establishment last winter, directed their struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. At that time, since their general direction was the same, they jointly acted and fought side by side in the struggle for power, forging revolutionary friendship. However, after the victory in the struggle for power, some people forgot what Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." They relaxed their self-reform, and bourgeois individualism, sectarianism, and other non-proletarian thoughts gradually grew. In February this year, during the joint criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, due to differing views on some minor issues, the Revolutionary Rebel Corps, believing they had the advantage of numbers, expelled the Red Rebel Corps and seized power alone; while the Red Rebel Corps adopted a non-recognition attitude. Both sides' antagonistic sentiments became increasingly intense.

	Self-Criticism on the Basis of Rectification

When contradictions arose within the revolutionary factions, they should be resolved according to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" through open rectification.

The leading core of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps studied the article "Where Is Our Lu Xun Corps Going?" and carried out open rectification. At the beginning, they were not mentally prepared and, upon hearing sharp opinions from the masses, thought it was an attack on themselves and could not accept it. The more they reacted this way, the more opinions the masses had. What should they do? They brought this problem to their study of Chairman Mao's works. "Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and pointing out of our shortcomings." Chairman Mao's words made them reflect deeply: usually, they said they would serve the people as servants after seizing power, but why could they not accept even a little criticism from the masses? No! They should regard the masses' opinions as the greatest care and concern for the new power-holders. They decided to adopt a correct attitude towards the masses' opinions and publicly admitted their shortcomings and mistakes in front of the masses. Soon after, the Red Rebel Corps also, in the spirit of self-criticism, admitted their shortcomings of over-criticizing the Revolutionary Rebel Corps and sometimes "raising issues to the extreme." Through rectification, both revolutionary organizations improved their understanding. They began to stop attacking each other, sat down, studied Chairman Mao's works, and calmly examined their past shortcomings and deviations.

Both revolutionary organizations took stock: they found that most of their time and energy had been spent on the "internal war." Over the past few months, they had consumed a lot of manpower and delayed production. Most of the propaganda materials were used for the "internal war," wasting a lot of paper and ink. Such a calculation alerted everyone. They thought that although everyone claimed to be a proletarian revolutionary faction, some of the things they were doing now went against Mao Zedong Thought, and they felt very sorry about it.

	Achieving Revolutionary Unity Through Criticism

Although the two revolutionary organizations had the desire to unite, due to the long-term "internal war," mutual suspicion had not been eliminated. For example, when one side mentioned unity, the other side suspected it lacked sincerity. When one side proposed holding a meeting, the other side suspected it was a plot. Thus, both sides could not sit together to discuss issues. How to solve this problem? The Revolutionary Rebel Corps, through study, clearly realized that they were the largest mass organization in the entire factory and were in power. Today, if they could not unite, the main aspect of the contradiction was on their side, and they should first eliminate suspicion and promote unity. After the Revolutionary Rebel Corps adopted this attitude, the Red Rebel Corps' attitude also changed. Thus, there were more common languages between them, and their thoughts became closer. Soon, both sides jointly held several struggle meetings, criticizing the handful of power-holders within the factory who were taking the capitalist road. During the criticism, both revolutionary organizations combined their study of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the editorial of the Red Flag magazine. Everyone's understanding improved significantly. In the past, they considered some minor issues of disagreement to be the most important, but now, compared to the issues exposed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, they thought those were nothing and should immediately direct their hatred towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. Everyone agreed that the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road had not yet been criticized down, criticized to pieces, and criticized to stink. The poison of the bourgeois reactionary line had not been eliminated. If left to develop, although the power had been seized by the revolutionary factions, in a few years, it might still be seized by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. With the enemy at hand, both sides had a thousand, ten thousand reasons to unite, but no reason to split. Thus, through consultation, they reunited and established a unified revolutionary organization for the entire factory, the "June 10th" Revolutionary Rebel Corps.

	Several Experiences from the Struggle

In the process of unity, split, and reunification, the two revolutionary organizations had the following common experiences:

1.	When the revolutionary factions firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and aim at the power-holders taking the capitalist road, they will unite; when the revolutionary factions within the faction are entangled in minor issues and attack each other, they will definitely split. Therefore, revolutionary factions must be good at seeking common ground while reserving differences and grasping the direction of the struggle, which is the key to achieving revolutionary unity.

2.	After the victory in the struggle for power, revolutionary factions must strengthen self-reform and fight against selfishness. With selfish thoughts, one cannot correctly treat oneself and others. Therefore, revolutionary factions should use the method of rectification to carry out self-criticism, conduct a revolution of breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, and guide the petty-bourgeois thoughts within their ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution.

3.	When the "internal war" is intense, both sides think their direction of struggle is correct and the other side's is wrong. This requires both sides to first calmly sit down, use the spirit of self-criticism to recall and summarize their past work, see how much time and energy was spent on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, and how much was spent on the "internal war." Practice has proven that recalling and summarizing, letting the masses educate themselves with living facts, is a good way to promote unity.

4.	Both sides of the "internal war" must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly distinguish and handle two types of contradictions of different natures. This study should be combined with the criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road. In this way, people can clearly understand the nature of the differences among revolutionary factions and the nature of the differences between revolutionary factions and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, and thus direct their hatred towards the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, unite as one, and fight the enemy together.

5.	After revolutionary factions unite organizationally, if they neglect unity in thought, the unity will be formalistic. Revolutionary factions must seriously deal with this issue and continue to use the method of rectification, promote democratic methods, and truly resolve the contradictions and differences within the organization in thought. In this way, revolutionary unity can be consolidated.

    坐下来学习，作自我批评，实现革命大联合
    北京东单皮鞋厂革命派实现革命大联合的经验和体会
    北京东单皮鞋厂无产阶级革命派革命造反者大队和红色造反者大队，在今年一月份联合夺权后，不到一个月便又分裂了。“内战”从二月打到五月，到了六月，两个革命组织才又重新联合起来，建立了全厂统一的革命组织“六一○”革命造反兵团。他们在这个联合——分裂——又联合的过程中，有些重要的经验教训，值得汲取。
          绝不能放松了自我改造
    革命造反者大队和红色造反者大队在去冬成立后，斗争的矛头都对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。当时由于大方向一致，他们在夺权斗争中，联合行动，并肩战斗，结下了革命的友谊。但是，夺权斗争胜利后，有些人忘记了林彪同志指出的：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”他们放松了自我改造，个人主义、山头主义等非无产阶级思想逐渐滋长起来。今年二月，两个革命组织在共同批判资产阶级反动路线时，由于对一些枝节问题认识不一致，革命造反者大队以为自己人多势众，便把红色造反者大队排除出去，单独掌权；而红色造反者大队则采取不予承认的态度。双方对立情绪越来越激烈。
      在整风的基础上，双方作自我批评
    革命派内部发生了矛盾，要按照“团结——批评——团结”的原则，通过开门整风来解决。
    革命造反者大队的领导核心学习了《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去》这篇文章，实行开门整风。开始他们因为思想准备不足，听到群众提出比较尖锐的意见，竟认为是对自己的攻击，听不进去。越这样，群众对他们的意见就更多。怎么办呢？他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”毛主席的这段教导引起了他们的深思：平时说掌权后要当人民的勤务员，为人民服务，为什么群众提出一点意见就受不了呢？不对！应该把群众提意见当作对新掌权者最大的爱护和关怀。他们决定用正确的态度对待群众的意见，在群众面前公开检讨了自己的缺点和错误。接着，红色造反者大队也以自我批评的精神检讨了对革命造反者大队提意见过火、有时“无限上纲”的缺点。通过整风，两个革命组织认识都有所提高。他们开始停止互相攻击，各自坐下来，一面学习毛主席著作，一面冷静地检查过去的缺点和偏差。
    两个革命组织各自算了账：都认为大部分的时间和精力用在打“内战”上了。几个月来，消耗了很多人力，耽误了不少生产。绝大部分宣传品都是用于打“内战”，浪费了国家许多纸张笔墨。这样一算，引起了大家的警惕。他们认为，大家都自称无产阶级革命派，但是，现在干的一些事，违背了毛泽东思想，想起来感到很痛心。
    在大批判的推动下，实现革命大联合
    两个革命组织虽然有了联合的愿望，但由于长时间打“内战”，彼此的相互怀疑还没有消除。例如一方提到大联合，对方就怀疑缺乏诚意。一方倡议开个什么会，对方也怀疑是搞阴谋。这样，双方还不能坐在一条板凳上商议问题。怎样解决这个问题？革命造反者大队经过学习，明确认识到自己是全厂最大的群众组织，又是掌权的，今天联合不起来，矛盾的主要方面在自己这边，自己应该首先消除怀疑，促进联合。革命造反者大队采取这种态度后，红色造反者大队的态度也有了转变。于是，相互之间的共同语言越来越多，思想上越来越接近。不久，双方就联合召开了几次斗争大会，批判厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。在批判过程中，两个革命组织都结合学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《红旗》杂志评论员的文章，大家的认识有了很大提高。过去，他们把一些枝节问题的分歧看得比什么都大，现在，和揭露出的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题一比较，都认为那简直算不了什么，应该立即把仇恨集中到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上。大家一致认为，现在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还没有批倒、批垮、批臭，资产阶级反动路线的流毒还没有肃清，如果任其发展下去，虽然大权被革命派夺回来了，再过几年又难免会被一小撮反革命修正主义分子夺过去。大敌当前，双方有一千条、一万条理由联合起来，而没有一条理由搞分裂。于是，经过协商，重新联合起来，建立了全厂统一的革命组织“六一○”革命造反兵团。
          斗争中的几点体会
    两个革命组织在联合——分裂——又联合过程中，共同的体会是：
    一、什么时候紧紧掌握斗争大方向，目标对着走资本主义道路的当权派，革命派就会联合起来；什么时候革命派内部在枝节问题上纠缠不休，互相攻击，就一定会走向分裂。因此革命派必须善于求大同存小异，掌握斗争的大方向，这是实现革命大联合的关键。
    二、革命派在夺权斗争胜利以后，必须加强自我改造，狠斗“私”字。有私心杂念，不仅不能正确对待自己，也不能正确对待别人。因此革命派应该用整风的方法，开展自我批评，进行破私立公的革命，把自己队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。
    三、革命派在“内战”打得火热的时候，谁都认为自己的斗争大方向是正确的，别人的斗争大方向是错误的。这就需要双方首先冷静地坐下来，用自我批评的精神，把过去的工作加以回忆总结，看一看用了多少时间和精力对待一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，用了多少时间和精力对待打“内战”。实践证明，通过回忆总结，让群众用活生生的事实自己教育自己，是促进大联合的好办法。
    四、打“内战”的双方，必须认真学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，根据毛主席的指示，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。这种学习，应该和批判斗争一小撮走资本主义道路当权派结合起来。这样，人们就能明确认识到革命派之间的分歧是什么性质，革命派和一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的分歧又是什么性质，从而把仇恨集中到一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上，团结一致，共同对敌。
    五、革命派在组织上联合起来后，如果忽视思想上的联合，联合就会流于形式，革命派必须认真对待这个问题，继续用整风的方法，发扬民主的方法，使组织内部的矛盾和分歧真正从思想上得到解决。这样，革命的大联合才能巩固。
