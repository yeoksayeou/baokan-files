Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the celebration of the full realization of the revolutionary great alliance in the financial and commercial system of the State Council. He conveyed the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao after his return to Beijing. He extended greetings on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to everyone, and offered congratulations.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated September 27, under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more than ten thousand revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from the financial and commercial system of the State Council gathered on September 26 to celebrate the full realization of the revolutionary great alliance and to promote both revolution and production. The revolutionary masses unanimously declared at the meeting that they would cherish the revolutionary great alliance as they cherish their own eyes, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fight against selfishness, and uphold selflessness. They would overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They would also seize the revolution and promote production, striving for victories in both revolution and production.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the celebration. He conveyed the latest instructions from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao after his inspection of the cultural revolution in North China, Central China, and East China. He also extended greetings on behalf of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary cadres of the financial and commercial system of the State Council, and offered congratulations. Premier Zhou said, you have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to arms, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved revolutionary great alliance in the revolutionary criticism. Congratulations! I hope you will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate your firepower and targets, direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of your own units. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance.

Premier Zhou hoped that all revolutionary mass organizations would, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handle contradictions among the people, and follow the policy of unity-criticism-unity, making more self-criticisms, eliminating selfishness, learning from each other, and further uniting politically and ideologically.

Attending the meeting today were also Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and comrades Zhang Chunqiao and Chen Boda.

The celebration was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The venue was filled with a warm atmosphere of unity and struggle. The meeting began with the solemn song "The East Is Red." More than ten thousand revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres opened their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause." They also recited Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke in the midst of enthusiastic applause. He said, on the eve of National Day, our financial and commercial units have responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, quickly achieving the revolutionary great alliance. This is an expression of our boundless love for Chairman Mao and a new contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the best gift to the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, the revolutionary great alliance has created good conditions for us to carry out the revolutionary criticism. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Khrushchev and his accomplices have been promoting in the financial and commercial sector for 17 years has deep roots and wide influence. We must, on the basis of the revolutionary great alliance, concentrate our firepower and targets, carry out the revolutionary criticism, and through solid and detailed work, resolutely eliminate its poisonous influence.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian hoped that the revolutionary cadres of the financial and commercial sector would further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." They should bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. At present, the main task is to do everything possible to do a good job, support the autumn harvest, and strive to achieve six excellences in agriculture. At the same time, we must also do a good job in the procurement of agricultural products and the distribution of industrial products to the countryside. The revolutionary comrades in the financial and commercial sector must use great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, cooperate with relevant departments, mobilize the masses, seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, implement the relevant policies of the Central Committee, complete and overfulfill the procurement tasks of agricultural products. We must work hard and strive for a double harvest of revolution and production in the financial and commercial sector, making the financial and commercial sector a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and ensuring that the financial and commercial work of our country will forever advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

The Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee of the Financial and Commercial System of the State Council and the revolutionary cadres from ten organs and three colleges and universities of the financial and commercial sector also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and a letter to the revolutionary workers of the financial and commercial system nationwide in the midst of thunderous applause. (Accompanying pictures)

　　传达伟大领袖毛主席回京后最新指示
　　代表毛主席、林副主席、中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组向大家问好，向大家祝贺
    据新华社二十七日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，国务院财贸系统的一万多名无产阶级革命派和革命群众，二十六日欢聚一堂，举行庆祝国务院财贸口无产阶级革命派全面实现革命大联合和抓革命、促生产大会。广大革命群众在会上一致表示，一定要象爱护眼珠一样爱护革命的大联合，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，巩固和发展革命的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；一定要抓好革命，搞好生产，争取革命生产双胜利。
    周恩来总理出席了庆祝大会。他在会上传达了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在视察华北、中南和华东地区文化大革命情况回京后所作的最新指示。他还代表我们伟大领袖毛主席和林副主席，代表中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组，向国务院财贸口的无产阶级革命派问好，向他们表示祝贺。周总理说，你们响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中实现了革命的大联合，庆贺你们！希望你们紧紧跟随毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，集中火力，集中目标，把斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，搞好本单位的斗批改，在毛泽东思想基础上，巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    周总理希望各革命群众组织根据毛主席的指示，正确处理人民内部矛盾，用团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方针，多作自我批评，把“私”字去掉，取长补短，相互学习，在政治上、思想上进一步联合起来。
    出席今天大会的还有李富春副总理、李先念副总理和张春桥、戚本禹等同志。
    庆祝大会在北京工人体育馆举行。会场上洋溢着团结战斗的热烈气氛。大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始，一万多名无产阶级革命派和革命群众打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”他们还共同背诵毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    李先念副总理在热烈的掌声中讲了话。他说，在国庆前夕，我们财贸口各单位坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，迅速实现了革命的大联合，这是对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，是对无产阶级文化大革命的新贡献，是向中华人民共和国成立十八周年最好的献礼。李先念副总理说，革命的大联合，为我们更好地进行革命大批判创造了良好的条件。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，十七年来在财贸部门推行的反革命修正主义路线，流毒很深，影响很广。我们要在革命大联合的基础上，集中火力，集中目标，搞好革命的大批判，通过扎实细致的工作，坚决地肃清其流毒。
    李先念副总理希望财贸口的无产阶级革命派，要进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，巩固和发展革命的大联合，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。在当前，主要是千方百计做好工作，支援三秋，努力做到农业六好。同时还必须做好农产品收购和工业品下乡工作。财贸部门的革命同志们必须以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，协同有关部门，发动广大群众，认真学习毛主席的各项有关指示，贯彻中央的有关政策，完成和超额完成农产品收购任务。必须积极努力，艰苦奋斗，争取财贸战线上革命和生产双丰收，把财贸部门办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，使我国的财贸工作永远沿着毛主席指示的方向胜利前进！
    国务院财贸口革命大联合委员会和财贸口十个机关、三个大专院校的无产阶级革命派代表，也在大会上分别讲了话。
    大会在暴风雨般的掌声中通过了给毛主席的致敬电，通过了告全国财贸系统革命职工书。（附图片）
