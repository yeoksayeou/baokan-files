The Majialing Coal Mine of the Datong Coal Mine has seen its revolutionary workers resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They insist on "doing revolution well when going up the shaft and doing production well when going down the shaft." From the 1st to the 26th of August, the average daily production completed 110.7% of the plan. They say, coal production is related to the socialist construction of the country, related to the lives of urban and rural people, and related to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, all the workers of the mine have been insisting on eight-hour production, voluntarily observing the revolutionary order of the proletariat, grasping revolution, and vigorously promoting production. The revolution and production have presented a new situation.
