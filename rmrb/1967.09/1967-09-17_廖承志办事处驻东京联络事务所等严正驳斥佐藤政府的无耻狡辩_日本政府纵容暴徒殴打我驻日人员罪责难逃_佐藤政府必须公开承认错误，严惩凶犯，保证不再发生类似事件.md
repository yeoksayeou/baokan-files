Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office and Chinese journalists in Japan held a press conference on September 14th, issuing a statement that strongly refutes the Japanese reactionary government's various defenses regarding the fascist atrocity of assaulting Chinese personnel in Japan.

The statement said that the response from the Japanese government, conveyed through the Gaoqi Office representative on September 13th regarding our three demands to the Japanese government, as well as the statement made by the Japanese government's police authorities on September 12th by the National Public Safety Commission Chairman Fujieda Izumi, are inconsistent with the actual situation. They distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, and intentionally evade responsibility.

The statement said that Fujieda's so-called response reveals the Japanese government's guilty conscience. Not only do they dare not admit that the Japanese police colluded with, incited, and sheltered right-wing thugs to engage in anti-China provocations and violence against Chinese personnel in Japan on the 9th, but they also intentionally avoid the fact that a large number of fully armed police were dispatched to create trouble and assault Chinese personnel on the evening of the 8th.

The statement said that on the evening of the 8th, when we were reasoning with the two provocateurs—"reporters" from the Jiji Press— the Japanese government suddenly sent out fifty or sixty fully armed police officers, armed with batons, along with a large number of plainclothes agents, to attack Chinese personnel in Japan. Not only did they protect and release the two "reporters" who were engaged in provocative activities, but they also acted arrogantly and unreasonably towards Chinese personnel in Japan who protested on the spot, injuring two of our drivers. Can these ironclad facts be erased?

The statement pointed out that Fujieda Izumi shamelessly claimed that "right-wing thugs are the objects of suppression, and the Japanese police would never collude with thugs." Fujieda, as the highest-ranking official of the National Public Safety Commission and the Japanese police, made such a hypocritical statement, attempting to deny the facts of our protest, which is utterly laughable.

The statement said that on the morning of the 9th, Japanese armed police drove to the vicinity of the residence of Chinese personnel in Japan, threatening us. In the afternoon at 2 PM, right-wing thugs rushed to our residence. Since the Japanese police already knew that the thugs were going to provoke us and considered the thugs to be "objects of suppression," why did the Japanese police authorities not immediately arrest and prosecute the thugs to prevent the incident from happening? In fact, the deputy chief of the Shibuya Police Station's security division cleared the way for the thug leader Akabane Toshiaki, holding a megaphone for him, standing obediently by his side, allowing him to maliciously defame our great leader Chairman Mao, and turning his back on the thugs to stand guard, allowing the thugs to wield sticks and commit violence for as long as an hour.

The statement said that what is even more intolerable is that when Chinese personnel in Japan sent representatives to protest to the police and demand that they immediately stop the thugs' rampant violence, the police not only did not intervene with the thugs but also committed violence against Chinese personnel in Japan, injuring six of us. Does this not fully prove that the Japanese police are closely colluding with right-wing thugs?

The statement said that Fujieda openly shouted that "we have taken necessary measures to restrain the Chinese," and "this is always the police's legitimate duty," etc. Their so-called execution of "legitimate duties" is to dispatch a large number of armed police, release provocateurs, incite right-wing thugs to maliciously defame the great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party of China, and the People's Republic of China, and to brutally assault Chinese personnel in Japan.

The statement also exposed a huge conspiracy hidden in Fujieda's speech, pointing out that his statement about "continuing the investigation of the obstruction of official duties suspected in connection with this incident" indicates that the Sato government of Japan is creating a "legal" basis for further intensifying the persecution of Chinese personnel in Japan. This is completely contradictory to Fujieda's claim of "full protection" for Chinese personnel in Japan.

The statement solemnly pointed out that at a time when Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, despite the strong opposition of the people of China and Japan, went to Taiwan to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, directly and rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, the armed police and plainclothes agents of Japan committed fascist atrocities against Chinese personnel in Japan. This is obviously a serious anti-China political incident premeditated by the Sato government.

The statement clearly stated: The response from the Japanese government and Fujieda Izumi's defenses are inconsistent with the facts. The three demands we made to the Japanese government through the Gaoqi Office are completely reasonable and legitimate. We still insist on these three demands.

The statement reaffirms:

1. The Sato government of Japan must publicly admit its mistakes and genuinely guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again;
2. Those who committed violence against Chinese personnel in Japan and their instigators must be severely punished;
3. We reserve the right to make further demands to the Japanese government.

The statement finally pointed out once again that all anti-China elements will meet a bad end. They will surely lift a stone to drop it on their own feet.

### 廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所等严正驳斥佐藤政府的无耻狡辩  日本政府纵容暴徒殴打我驻日人员罪责难逃  佐藤政府必须公开承认错误，严惩凶犯，保证不再发生类似事件

    廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所等严正驳斥佐藤政府的无耻狡辩
    日本政府纵容暴徒殴打我驻日人员罪责难逃
    佐藤政府必须公开承认错误，严惩凶犯，保证不再发生类似事件
    新华社东京十五日电廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所和中国驻日记者，在十四日举行的记者招待会上发表一项声明，严正驳斥日本反动政府关于殴打中国驻日人员法西斯暴行事件的种种狡辩。
    声明说，九月十三日，日本政府通过高碕办事处代表向我们转达的关于我们向日本政府提出的三项要求的答复，以及日本政府警察当局九月十二日发表的国家公安委员长藤枝泉介的谈话，是不符合实际情况的，是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，有意逃脱罪责。
    声明说，藤枝的所谓答复，表明了日本政府作贼心虚，不仅不敢承认日本警察在九日勾结、纵容和庇护右翼暴徒进行反华叫嚣，并向中国驻日人员施加暴力的罪行，而且有意回避八日晚制造事端出动大批全副武装的警察殴打中国人员的事实。
    声明说，八日晚，正当我们对两名挑衅者——时事通讯社的“记者”据理交涉时，日本政府突然派出五、六十名手执警棒的全副武装的警察，在大批便衣特务的配合下，袭击了中国驻日人员，不仅包庇和放走了进行挑衅活动的两名“记者”，而且对当场提出抗议的中国驻日人员蛮横无理，并打伤了我们的两名司机。难道这一铁的事实能够抹煞得了吗？
    声明指出，藤枝泉介狡辩说什么“右翼暴徒是被取缔的对象，日本警察绝对不会和暴徒勾结起来”。藤枝作为国家公安委员长、日本警察的最高负责人竟然作出这种冠冕堂皇的欺人之谈，企图否认我们抗议的事实，简直是滑天下之大稽。
    声明说，九日上午，日本武装警察乘坐警车开到中国驻日人员住所周围，对我进行恫吓。下午二时，右翼暴徒闯至我住所前。既然日本警察早就知道暴徒到我处挑衅，而且认为暴徒是“被取缔的对象”，为什么日本警察当局不立即把暴徒逮捕法办而防止事件于未然呢？事实上，涩谷警察署警备科长为暴徒头子赤尾敏开路，给他拿着扩音器，规规矩矩地站在赤尾敏的身旁，放纵他恶毒地诬蔑我们的伟大的领袖毛主席，并且背向着暴徒给它站岗放哨，纵容暴徒挥舞棍棒行凶，时间长达一小时之久。
    声明说，更加令人不能容忍的是，当中国驻日人员派出代表向警察提出抗议，要求他们立即制止暴徒猖狂暴行时，警察不仅不干预暴徒，反而对中国驻日人员施加暴行，打伤踢伤我六人。难道这不充分地证明了日本警察同右翼暴徒紧密地勾结在一起吗？
    声明说，藤枝公然叫嚷什么“我们对中国人采取了必要的制止行动”，“这始终是警察的正当职务”等等。他们的所谓执行“正当职务”，就是出动大批武装警察，放走挑衅者，纵容右翼暴徒疯狂污蔑中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党、中华人民共和国，就是野蛮地殴打中国驻日人员。
    声明还揭露了藤枝谈话中隐藏了一个巨大的阴谋，指出他所说的对于“围绕这一事件发生的妨碍公务执行嫌疑事件，继续进行搜查”，就预示着日本佐藤政府正在为进一步变本加厉地迫害中国驻日人员制造“合法”的根据。这同藤枝所谈的什么对中国驻日人员的“万全的保护”，岂不是完全自相矛盾吗？
    声明严正指出，正当日本首相佐藤荣作不顾中日两国人民的强烈反对，去台湾与蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结、直接地粗暴地干涉中国内政的时候，日本武装警察和便衣特务，对中国驻日人员施加法西斯暴行，显然是佐藤政府预谋制造的严重的反华政治事件。
    声明明确地表示：日本政府所作的答复和藤枝泉介的狡辩，是不符合事实的。我们通过高碕办事处向日本政府提出的三项要求是完全合理、完全正当的，现在我们仍然坚持这三项要求。
    声明重申：
    一、日本佐藤政府必须公开承认错误，切实保证不再发生类似事件；
    二、必须严惩向中国驻日人员施以暴行的警察及其指使者；
    三、保留向日本政府进一步提出要求的权利。
    声明最后再一次指出，一切反华分子决没有好下场，他们必将搬起石头打自己的脚。
