Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the beacon for the proletarian revolutionaries to advance victoriously. Tianjin and Hangzhou have swiftly launched a high tide of revolutionary unity.

Tianjin: Over 800 factories and enterprises and more than 150 schools have achieved revolutionary unity.

Hangzhou: Over 90% of factories and enterprises have achieved revolutionary unity.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 22nd: The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions have shown the Tianjin workers, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards the direction forward. From yesterday to today, over 800 factories, enterprises, and more than 150 schools in the city have achieved revolutionary unity according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In these two days, from the banks of the Haihe River to the Tanggu New Port on the Bohai Gulf, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses who have achieved unity, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait, beating drums and gongs, rushed to the Tianjin Military Support Leftist Liaison Station, Tianjin Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, and various district production command centers to report their successes. The entire city is filled with a moving scene of revolutionary unity.

Chairman Mao said: Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached Tianjin, revolutionary workers, masses, and Red Guards immediately studied and discussed them, expressing their determination to achieve revolutionary unity in the great criticism and to be models of revolutionary unity. Some factory and school revolutionary mass organizations' leaders were still discussing the issue of unity, but the masses below had already united. In this way, from the bottom up, the masses urged the leaders, quickly pushing revolutionary unity to a high tide.

The two major factions in Tianjin's Anti-Revision Nylon Factory studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, exchanged views, and expressed their determination to unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and fight together. In this way, the two factions quickly united. The workers said: We not only unite in organization but also in thought and action, thoroughly achieving revolutionary unity. Like the revolutionary workers of Anti-Revision Nylon Factory, the revolutionary workers of 130 chemical system factories and enterprises are striving to be models of revolutionary unity. Now, 99 units have achieved revolutionary unity.

Tianjin Cotton Textile Mill has five mass organizations. In the past, some organizations lacked the spirit of self-criticism, entangled in minor issues, and affected unity. In these two days, several organizations, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, started from the overall situation, conducted strict self-criticism, and finally united to form a unified organization for the entire factory.

The "August 18" Red Rebel Corps and the "Wei Dong" Red Guards of Nankai University, who made important contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, recently studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions repeatedly, conducted serious self-criticism, eliminated petty-bourgeois factionalism, and focused on revolutionary criticism and unity. Finally, they eliminated the estrangement and achieved school-wide revolutionary unity on the 21st. At the same time, Hebei University, Tianjin Institute of Technology, and ten other higher education institutions, as well as more than 100 middle and primary schools, also achieved revolutionary unity.

Currently, the revolutionary unity in Tianjin is developing vigorously. Revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to achieve city-wide revolutionary unity before National Day to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 22nd: The Hangzhou working class is resolutely carrying out the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, launching a new high tide of revolutionary unity. So far, over 90% of the factories and enterprises in the city have achieved revolutionary unity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached Hangzhou, many factory and enterprise revolutionary workers acted swiftly. They said, we workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Chairman Mao says how, we do how! We must be models of revolutionary unity. The four revolutionary mass organizations of Hangzhou Silk Dyeing and Printing United Factory, which had been in a state of opposition for a long time, decided to eliminate small factions after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, merging the four revolutionary mass organizations into one, and establishing the Hangzhou Silk Dyeing and Printing United Factory Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters. The proletarian revolutionaries of Zhejiang Cotton Textile Mill and Zhejiang Provincial Navigation Company Hangzhou Branch, and other units, quickly achieved the broadest revolutionary unity based on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Since April this year, the proletarian revolutionaries of Hangzhou's factories and enterprises have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a mass movement of revolutionary criticism. Through criticism, they promoted the unity of revolutionary mass organizations. Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers further understood the significance of revolutionary unity. Many workers said: The reason why there is a situation of two factions within the working class is due to the capitalist roaders in power. This account should be settled with the Chinese Khrushchev.

In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, the proletarian revolutionaries of factories and enterprises modelly executed the party's policies, helped the deceived masses to get rid of the influence of the capitalist reactionary line, and together advanced victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Some deceived workers in units such as Zhejiang Cotton Textile Mill, who had left their production posts under the manipulation of the capitalist roaders in power, took up the production burden on one hand and conducted detailed political and ideological work on the deceived masses on the other, helping them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

　　毛主席最新指示是无产阶级革命派乘胜前进的指路明灯
　　天津杭州迅速掀起革命大联合高潮
　　天津：八百多工厂企业一百五十多所学校实现了革命大联合
　　杭州：百分之九十以上的工厂企业已经实现了革命大联合
    据新华社天津二十二日电　伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，给天津市工人阶级和广大革命群众、红卫兵小将指明了前进的航向。从昨天到今天，全市已有八百多个工厂、企业和一百五十多所学校，照毛主席的指示实现了革命大联合。这两天，从海河两岸到渤海湾的塘沽新港，成千上万的实现了大联合的革命群众，抬着毛主席的画像，敲锣打鼓，拥向天津驻军支左联络站、天津市革命委员会筹备小组和各区生产指挥部报喜，全市到处都是一片革命大联合的动人景象。
    毛主席说：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的这一最新指示传到天津以后，广大革命工人、革命群众、红卫兵小将立即学习、讨论，纷纷表示一定要在革命的大批判中实现革命大联合，誓作革命大联合的模范。有的工厂、学校的革命群众组织的负责人还正在一起讨论大联合的问题，下面的群众就已联合起来。这样自下而上，群众促头头，很快就推动革命大联合进入了高潮。
    天津反修锦纶厂的两大派组织都学习了毛主席的最新指示，双方工人在一起谈心，交换意见，都表示要在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下联合起来，共同战斗。这样，两大派很快就联合起来了。工人们说：我们不仅在组织上联合，还要做到思想上、行动上联合，彻底地实现革命大联合。象反修锦纶厂的革命工人一样，化工系统一百三十个工厂企业的革命工人都争做革命大联合的模范，现在已有九十九个单位实现了革命大联合。
    天津麻纺织厂有五个群众组织，过去有的组织缺乏自我批评精神，纠缠一些枝节问题，影响了大联合。这两天，几个组织都根据毛主席的指示，从大局出发，做了严格的自我批评，最后联合起来成立了全厂性的统一组织。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了重要贡献的南开大学“八一八”红色造反团和“卫东”红卫兵，最近，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，认真开展自我批评，铲除小资产阶级的派性，以革命的大批判、大联合为重，终于消除了隔阂，在二十一日实现了全校革命大联合。与此同时，河北大学、天津工学院等十所高等院校和一百多所中、小学校也实现了革命大联合。
    目前，天津市的革命大联合正在蓬勃发展，广大革命群众表示决心在国庆节前实现全市革命大联合，迎接中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    据新华社杭州二十二日电　杭州市工人阶级最坚决地执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，掀起了革命大联合的新高潮。到目前为止，全市实现革命大联合的工厂企业，已经达到百分之九十以上。
    毛主席教导我们：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的这一最新指示传到杭州以后，许多工厂企业的革命工人闻风而动。他们说，我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干！我们一定要当革命大联合的模范。杭州丝绸印染联合厂的四个革命群众组织，过去长期处于对立状态，在学习毛主席的最新指示后，决定铲除小山头，把四个革命群众组织合成一个组织，成立了杭州丝绸印染联合厂革命造反联合总部。浙江麻纺织厂、浙江省航运公司杭州分公司等单位的无产阶级革命派，都在学习毛主席最新指示的基础上，迅速实现了最广泛的革命大联合。
    今年四月份以后，杭州市工厂企业的无产阶级革命派就紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展了革命大批判的群众运动。通过大批判，促进了革命群众组织的团结。最近学习了毛主席的最新指示，工人群众进一步认识到了革命大联合的意义。许多工人说：我们工人阶级内部所以出现两派对立的局面，是资产阶级反动路线造成的，这笔账要向中国赫鲁晓夫去算。
    在实现革命大联合的过程中，工厂企业的无产阶级革命派模范地执行了党的政策，帮助受蒙蔽的群众摆脱资产阶级反动路线的影响，共同沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。浙江麻纺织厂等单位一些受蒙蔽的工人，前一时期在党内走资本主义道路当权派操纵下，曾擅自离开生产岗位。这些工厂的无产阶级革命派一面挑起生产重担，一面对受蒙蔽群众进行细致的政治思想工作，帮助他们迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。（附图片）
