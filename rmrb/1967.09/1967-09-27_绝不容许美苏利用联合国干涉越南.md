The twenty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly has just begun, and a farce of the U.S. and Soviet Union colluding to interfere in Vietnam through the United Nations is already being staged. The U.S. representative Goldberg has been frequently active both inside and outside the United Nations. The Soviet revisionist foreign minister Gromyko is closely coordinating. Their tunes are different, but the melody is the same: to push a new "peace talks" deception in the Vietnam issue.

The farce being staged at the United Nations is part of the conspiracy plan agreed upon at the Glassboro talks between the U.S. and Soviet Union to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. In this new "peace offensive," not only are the U.S. and Soviet Union in collusion, personally taking the stage, but their various big and small lackeys and accomplices are also rushing out to run errands and cheer. Figures such as U.N. Secretary-General U Thant, British Prime Minister Wilson, Canadian Prime Minister Pearson, Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo, and the Tito clique of traitors are all engaged in unusually intense activities, putting in a lot of effort to participate in this evil scheme, making a mess of things.

The U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to interfere in the Vietnam issue through the United Nations has a long history. Their goal is to shove the Vietnam issue into the United Nations and rally some people to serve their "peace talks" deception. However, no matter how hard they try, playing whatever tricks, each time they end up in a shameful failure. Currently, the U.S. imperialists are in an increasingly dire situation in their war of aggression against Vietnam. They have exhausted all kinds of tricks, but still cannot reverse the tide of defeat. Thus, the Johnson administration has once again raised the tattered flag of the United Nations, hoping to find a way out.

Goldberg's speech at the twenty-first session of the General Assembly on the 21st was like a poor salesman, hoarsely peddling old goods such as "political solution," "stopping the bombing," "gradual de-escalation," "reconvening the Geneva Conference," and so on. In essence, it is to coerce the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms in the face of American aggressors, stop the struggle, and make the already victorious Vietnam anti-American struggle for national salvation come to a halt halfway, thus achieving the evil goal of the U.S. permanently occupying South Vietnam and splitting Vietnam.

The U.S. imperialists put up the United Nations sign, thinking that this can make their "peace talks" deception look more attractive, to deceive world public opinion and lull the peoples of various countries. This is completely in vain.

Everyone knows that the United Nations is a tool of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the big boss of the United Nations. U.S. imperialism has always used the United Nations to interfere in and invade various places around the world, doing all sorts of evil deeds. The United Nations has long been infamous and stinking in the eyes of the peoples of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out with penetrating insight: "In the eyes of U.S. imperialism, what is the United Nations, what is the Organization of American States, what are other things, all are tools in its palm. When it needs these tools, it uses them; when it does not need them, it kicks them away. Kicked away, it can pick them up again. Whether to use or kick away, it all depends on what is beneficial to its aggressive purposes." The Johnson administration's use of the United Nations to stage a big "peace talks" deception this time again proves this point.

The Soviet revisionist clique is an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in using the United Nations to interfere in Vietnamese affairs. After Goldberg's speech at the General Assembly, Gromyko came out the next day to echo, talking about the "danger" of the Vietnam issue and creating public opinion for "bombing halt and deception." At that time, Goldberg did not hide the fact that when the U.S. staged the "peace talks" deception, it "mainly" hoped for the help of the Soviet revisionists. During the General Assembly session, the foreign ministers of the U.S., Soviet Union, and other countries will also arrange a series of new meetings to discuss the Vietnam issue. The Soviet revisionist newspaper *Izvestia* in its commentary on the first day of this General Assembly session, blatantly stated that if the U.S. stops bombing North Vietnam, it can open up the path to a "peaceful solution" to the Vietnam issue. This has exposed the content of the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy.

The peoples of the world all know that the Vietnam issue has nothing to do with the United Nations. Vietnamese affairs must be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves, and no outsiders are allowed to interfere. The United Nations has no right to meddle in the Vietnam issue. U.S. imperialism is the criminal who invaded Vietnam. Goldberg actually advocates that the United Nations, which is controlled by the U.S., should "actively participate in seeking peace in Vietnam," and the Soviet revisionist clique also collaborates with this, truly shameless!

The Vietnamese people have always firmly opposed the United Nations meddling in the Vietnam issue. Recently, the *People's Daily* of Vietnam published a commentary on the U.S. using the twenty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly to plot a new "peace talks" deception, once again clearly reaffirming the Vietnamese people's solemn position. The commentary pointed out, "The United Nations has no right to interfere in Vietnam. The Vietnam issue can only be resolved on the basis of the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh recently wrote in a letter to the people of South Vietnam: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is no trace of American aggressors on our beloved land!" This is the solemn vow of the 31 million Vietnamese people! U.S. imperialism has already been defeated on the battlefield. The heroic Vietnamese people will continue to fight, definitely drive out the American aggressors and their accomplices, and achieve a complete victory in national liberation and national reunification!

At this critical moment in the Vietnam anti-American struggle for national salvation, anyone who participates in the United Nations' interference in Vietnam is serving the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, is betraying the Vietnamese people. This is absolutely unacceptable.

### 绝不容许美苏利用联合国干涉越南

    绝不容许美苏利用联合国干涉越南
    第二十二届联合国大会刚刚召开，一个美苏联合串演的利用联合国干涉越南问题的丑剧，马上紧锣密鼓地上演了。美国代表戈德堡在联合国会内会外，频繁活动。苏修外长葛罗米柯密切配合。双方唱腔不同，调子却是一样，要在越南问题上推行新的“和谈”骗局。
    正在联合国上演的这场丑剧，是美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈合谋扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争烈火的阴谋计划的一个组成部分。在这次新的“和平攻势”中，不仅美苏串通一气，亲自出马，而且他们的大大小小的仆从和帮凶，也纷纷出来奔走效劳，呐喊助威。什么联合国秘书长吴丹，什么英国首相威尔逊，什么加拿大总理皮尔逊，什么日本外相三木武夫，以及铁托叛徒集团等等，都在进行非同寻常的紧张活动，为参与这一罪恶勾当大卖力气，搞得乌烟瘴气。
    美帝国主义利用联合国插手越南问题的阴谋活动，由来已久。其目的就是要把越南问题塞进联合国，拉拢一些人来为其推行“和谈”骗局服务。但是，不管他们挖空心思，玩弄什么花样，每次都以可耻的失败而告终。目前，美帝国主义在侵越战争中处境越来越不妙，各种各样的法术都已使尽，仍然挽回不了败局。于是，约翰逊政府重新打起了联合国这面破烂不堪的旗帜，妄想找到一条出路。
    戈德堡在联大二十一日会议上的演说，象一个蹩脚的商品推销员，声调嘶哑地叫卖什么“政治解决”，“停炸”，“逐步降级”，“重新召开日内瓦会议”等等陈旧货色。说穿了，无非是要诱迫越南人民在美国侵略者面前放下武器，停止斗争，使已经取得伟大胜利的越南抗美救国战争半途而废，以实现美国永久霸占越南南方、分裂越南的罪恶目的。
    美帝国主义端出联合国这块招牌，以为这样可以把它的“和谈”骗局装潢得漂亮一些，来欺骗世界舆论，麻痹各国人民。这完全是徒劳的。
    谁都知道，联合国是美帝国主义的工具。美帝国主义是联合国的大老板。美帝国主义一贯利用联合国在世界各地进行干涉和侵略活动，做尽了坏事。联合国在世界人民中，早就声名狼藉，臭不可闻了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经一针见血地指出：“在美帝国主义眼里，什么联合国，什么美洲国家组织，什么别的玩意儿，统统都是它手掌里的工具。对于这些工具，它用得着就用，用不着的时候就一脚踢开。踢开了，还可以拣起来再用。用也好，踢开也好，都是以有利于它的侵略目的为转移。”约翰逊政府这次利用联合国大搞
  “和谈”骗局，又一次证明了这一点。
    苏修叛徒集团是美帝国主义利用联合国干涉越南事务的同谋犯。戈德堡在联大发言以后，葛罗米柯第二天就出来帮腔，大谈其越南问题的“危险”，为搞“停炸诱和”大造舆论。当时，戈德堡毫不隐讳地表示，美国搞“和谈”骗局时，“心中想到的主要”就是指望苏修方面的帮忙。在联大开会期间，美苏等国外长还将安排一系列新的会议来讨论越南问题。苏修《消息报》在对这届联大第一天会议的评论中，露骨地表示，美国停止对越南北方的轰炸，就可以开辟“和平解决”越南问题的道路。这就把美苏密谋的内容和盘托出来了。
    全世界人民都清楚地知道，越南问题与联合国根本无关。越南的事务必须由越南人民自己解决，决不容许任何外人干涉。联合国没有丝毫权利来过问越南问题。美帝国主义是侵略越南的罪犯，戈德堡居然还鼓吹由美国一手控制的联合国来“积极参加寻求越南和平的工作”，苏修集团也居然加以配合，真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    越南人民从来都坚决反对联合国插手越南问题。最近，越南《人民报》就美国利用二十二届联合国大会策划新的“和谈”骗局发表评论，又一次明确地重申了越南人民的这一严正立场。评论指出，“联合国无权干涉越南。越南问题只能在越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明的基础上解决。”
    胡志明主席在最近给越南南方人民的信里坚定宣告：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”这是三千一百万越南人民的庄严誓言！美帝国主义在战场上已经被打得一败涂地。英雄的越南人民坚持打下去，一定能够把美国侵略者及其帮凶统统赶出去，取得民族解放和祖国统一的彻底胜利！
    在越南抗美救国战争进入关键时刻的今天，任何人如果参与联合国干涉越南的活动，那就是为美国侵略越南效劳，那就是对越南人民的出卖。这是绝对不能容许的。
