We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We have appeared in the stormy waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with a fighting posture. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, raise high the banner of "Rebellion is Justified," and rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, rebel against all ghosts and monsters, and rebel against all ideological remnants of the exploiting classes. We strictly demand of ourselves the conditions of being successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, growing and strengthening ourselves in the great waves of class struggle.

Our revolutionary actions have frightened the gentlemen in the Kremlin. They are on high alert and hurriedly mobilize all their propaganda machines to slander and defame our Cultural Revolution. Amidst a chorus of abuse, these fellows blather on about how in China today, "knowledge is being banned," the people "have no right to education." They even say that one of the results of the Cultural Revolution in China is "the closure of all schools."

The Soviet revisionist clique has thoroughly betrayed Marxism-Leninism. They dream of rubles and profits all day and engage in selling out the revolution. Now, they are pretending to be high and mighty, talking about knowledge issues and the education of the younger generation, which is truly shameless!

Is "knowledge being banned"? These Soviet revisionist gentlemen are truly the most laughable "experts" in the world, not even knowing the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.

What is knowledge? The greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, our great leader Chairman Mao, said: "Since the existence of class society, there have been only two kinds of knowledge in the world: one is the knowledge of production struggle, and the other is the knowledge of class struggle." Marxism-Leninism is a high-level summary and generalization of the knowledge of production struggle and class struggle. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. In revolutionary practice, we deeply understand: this knowledge, that knowledge, Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious knowledge; above all, it is most important to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We revolutionary youth have an infinite love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought.

Of course, in our proletarian dictatorship country, there is also knowledge that is "banned," and that is the so-called "knowledge" of the bourgeoisie and revisionists. The class enemies attempt to use these filthy things to pollute our bodies and corrupt our souls, making us undergo a "peaceful evolution." We must criticize and ban these "knowledges" thoroughly. Chairman Mao said: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao's great directive has sentenced the old educational system to death. In the Cultural Revolution, we must smash the old educational system. The trash peddled by the bourgeois "scholars," "authorities," and "educators" is all in the banned category.

Our great leader Chairman Mao clearly proposed the educational policy of "serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Chairman Mao also emphasized: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn."

The great proletarian cultural revolution is the best opportunity for us to receive education. Our millions of young people are full of vigor and vitality, with high morale, breaking free from the shackles of feudalism and capitalism that have been on our heads for thousands of years, stepping out of the classroom, charging into society, sweeping away the Four Olds, and launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and all ghosts and monsters. We use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously raise and transform ourselves, seizing the power of the "self" in our minds. As Lenin said: "In the revolutionary period, what thousands and tens of thousands of people learn in a week is more than what they learn in a year of confused life." Today, we do not go to class precisely so that we can go to class better tomorrow; not going to class for a year is precisely so that we can go to class well for thousands and tens of thousands of years in the future. The Soviet revisionist leadership viciously slanders us, saying that we "close all schools," do not want "knowledge," do not want "learning," and that Chinese youth "do not have the right to receive education," and so on. In fact, what they are attacking is precisely the Marxist-Leninist educational policy that we advocate: "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." In their view, youth should only listen to the nonsense of bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in an orderly and disciplined manner, which is a matter of course.

The Soviet revisionist _Teacher's Newspaper_ slanders that China's "teaching and education of the younger generation is not considered from the interests of the Cultural Revolution, but from the private interests of the upper echelon." This is sheer nonsense. In class society, teaching and education are all for the political service of their own class. Our Chinese younger generation's teaching and education must conform to the interests of the proletariat. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest interest of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. We firmly carry out and implement Chairman Mao's educational policy, which is to serve the people and be loyal to the greatest interests of the absolute majority of the people in the world.

It is truly a case of self-exposure. The Soviet revisionist leadership's teaching and education are indeed purely for the private interests of the Soviet revisionist "upper echelon." Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, in order to cultivate slaves for their small upper echelon, use "material incentives" and "personal fame and fortune" as bait to corrupt the souls of the youth and erode the revolutionary will of the youth. The Soviet revisionist leadership is the chief culprit in poisoning Soviet youth. One day, Soviet revolutionary youth will launch a fierce attack on the traitors of Lenin.

    反面教员的“教育理论”可以休矣	山西大学中文系　反修兵
    我们是毛主席的红小兵。我们以战斗的姿态出现在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨中。我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，遵照毛主席的教导，高举“造反有理”的大旗，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造一切牛鬼蛇神的反，造一切剥削阶级意识形态的反。我们以无产阶级革命事业接班人的条件严格要求自己，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里不断成长壮大。
    我们的革命行动，吓坏了克里姆林宫里的老爷们。他们如临大敌，赶忙发动所有的宣传机器，对我们的文化大革命极尽其诋毁诬蔑之能事。在一片骂声里，这些家伙胡说什么今天在中国，“知识在被禁之列”，人民“没有受教育的权利”。还说什么中国“文化大革命的结果之一”是“关闭所有学校”。
    苏修集团彻底背叛了马列主义，他们成天做的是卢布、利润的梦，干的是出卖革命的事，现在，竟然装腔作势大谈什么知识问题，对青年一代的教育问题，真是恬不知耻！
    “知识在被禁之列”吗？苏修老爷们真是世界上最可笑的“知识里手”，竟连马克思列宁主义的起码知识都不知道。
    什么叫做知识？当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。”马克思列宁主义是生产斗争和阶级斗争知识的高度概括和总结。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。在革命实践中我们深深懂得：这知识，那知识，毛泽东思想才是最宝贵的知识；千重要，万重要，活学活用毛主席著作最重要。我们革命青年对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜。
    当然，在我们无产阶级专政的国家里，也有属于“被禁之列”的“知识”，那就是资产阶级和修正主义的一套所谓“知识”。阶级敌人妄图利用这些乌七八糟的东西玷污我们的肌体，腐蚀我们的灵魂，使我们“和平演变”。对于这些“知识”，我们就是要大批特批，大禁特禁。毛主席说：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的这一伟大指示，宣判了旧教育制度的死刑。在文化大革命中，我们就是要砸烂旧教育制度，资产阶级的什么“学者”、“权威”和“教育家”所兜售的那一摊子破烂货，统统在被禁之列。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席明确地提出了“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针。毛主席还强调指出：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们受教育的最好机会。我们的千百万青年朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬，冲破了千百年封建主义和资本主义束缚在我们头上的枷锁，走出课堂，冲向社会，横扫四旧，向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火。我们用毛泽东思想不断提高自己，改造自己，夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。正如列宁所说：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。”我们今天不上课，正是为了明天更好地上课；一年不上课，正是为了今后千年万年上好课。苏修领导集团恶毒诬蔑我们“关闭所有学校”，不要“知识”，不要“学问”，我国青年“没有实行受教育的权利”等等。其实，他们攻击的，正是我们所主张的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的马列主义的教育方针。在他们看来，青年只有按部就班，循规蹈矩地去听那些资产阶级反动“权威”的鬼话才是天经地义的事。
    苏修《教师报》诬蔑说什么中国“对青年一代的教学和教育，不是从文化大革命的利益考虑的，而是从上层集团的私利考虑的。”这完全是胡说八道。在阶级社会中，教学和教育都是为本阶级的政治服务的。我们中国青年一代的教学和教育，就是要符合无产阶级的利益。毛泽东思想是中国人民和世界革命人民的最高利益，我们坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的教育方针，就是为人民服务，也就是忠于世界绝大多数人民的最大利益。
    真是不打自招。苏修领导集团的教学和教育，正是地地道道从苏修“上层集团的私利考虑的”。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为了培植替他们一小撮上层集团效劳的奴才，他们利用“物质刺激”和“个人名利”为诱饵，腐蚀青年的灵魂，消磨青年的革命意志。苏修领导集团是毒害苏联青年的罪魁祸首。总有一天，苏联革命青年会向列宁的叛徒发起猛烈的冲击。
