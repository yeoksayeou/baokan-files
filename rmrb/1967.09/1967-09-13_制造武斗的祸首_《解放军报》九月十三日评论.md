The infamous "squatting" in Taoyuan, directed by the Chinese Khrushchev, is a notorious example of using fascist methods to create white terror and implement bourgeois dictatorship.

In this regard, they have employed many barbaric practices. "Yanfei" (also known as "jet plane") was created by the bourgeois element Wang XX.

During her "squatting" in Taoyuan, Wang XX conducted brutal struggles and merciless suppression against revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. She repeatedly personally "increased the temperature" and "increased the pressure," engaging in what she called "slow-cooking fish," "wheel tactics," forcing people to stand, kneel, bow their heads, endure heat, cold, "Yanfei," detention, and even threatening with a handgun. She extensively used methods of coercion, forced confessions, and false accusations. It is clear that the Chinese Khrushchev and Wang XX are the chief culprits behind armed struggles.

In the "Twenty-Three Articles" for the Four Clean-ups movement, personally directed by Chairman Mao, it is stated: "Facts must be presented, and reasons must be given. Simple and rough methods must be prevented. Physical punishment and other forms of corporal punishment are strictly forbidden. Coercion, forced confessions, and false accusations must be prevented."

In the "Sixteen Points" for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally directed by Chairman Mao, it is stated: "Struggles should be conducted through words, not through violence."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Party Central Committee, led by Chairman Mao, has never advocated armed struggles or approved of them. Because the truth is on our side, the proletarian revolutionary faction. We have the great Mao Zedong Thought, which allows us to defeat the enemy through struggles conducted through words and through revolutionary criticism and struggle. Armed struggles can only affect the surface, while struggles conducted through words can touch the soul, thoroughly exposing the counter-revolutionary face of the enemy, isolating them to the greatest extent, and overthrowing, smashing, and disgracing them. Only struggles conducted through words can educate the masses to see clearly and raise their consciousness.

In the Cultural Revolution, advocating armed struggles is the proposal of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They not only personally suppress and engage in armed struggles against revolutionary masses but also use every means to instigate the masses to engage in armed struggles, aiming to sabotage the Party's policies and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They vainly attempt to pin the blame for armed struggles on the proletarian revolutionary faction, which is in vain.

All proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. Insist on struggles conducted through words and do not engage in armed struggles. We must throw all bourgeois elements, along with their "inventions" like "Yanfei," into the garbage heap of history!

    制造武斗的祸首
    ——《解放军报》九月十三日评论
    中国赫鲁晓夫导演的臭名昭著的桃园“蹲点”，是采用法西斯手段，搞白色恐怖，实行资产阶级专政的一个丑恶典型。
    在这方面，他们搞了许多野蛮的做法。“燕飞”（又称“喷气式”），就是资产阶级分子王××一手创造出来的。
    王××在桃园“蹲点”时，对革命干部和革命群众，进行残酷斗争，无情打击。她一再亲自“加温”“加压”，大搞什么“慢火煎鱼”，“车轮战术”，罚站罚跪，低头弯腰，火烤，冷冻，“燕飞”，拘留，甚至用手枪威胁，大搞逼、供、信。可见，中国赫鲁晓夫和王××，是进行武斗的罪魁祸首。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的四清运动的“二十三条”中指出：“要摆事实，讲道理，防止简单、粗暴的做法，严禁打人和其他形式的体罚，防止逼、供、信。”
    毛主席亲自主持制定的文化大革命的“十六条”中指出：“要用文斗，不用武斗。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为首的党中央从来不主张武斗，不赞成武斗。因为真理在我们无产阶级革命派一边。我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，完全可以用文斗的办法，用革命大批判的办法，战胜敌人。武斗只能触及皮肉，文斗才能触其灵魂，才能彻底暴露敌人的反革命面目，把他们最大限度地孤立起来，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。也只有文斗，才能教育群众擦亮眼睛，提高觉悟。
    在文化大革命中进行武斗，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的主张。他们不但自己动手对革命群众进行残酷的镇压和武斗，而且千方百计地挑动群众进行武斗，来破坏党的政策，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们妄图把武斗的罪名加到无产阶级革命派头上，完全是徒劳的。
    一切无产阶级革命派和革命群众，必须保持高度的革命警惕。坚持文斗，不用武斗。我们要把一切资产阶级的东西，连同他们“发明”的“燕飞”等等，一起抛进历史的垃圾堆！
