The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat at Uda Leap Forward Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's directive to be both "officials" and "common people," going to the production front lines. They have led the way in studying Chairman Mao's works, leading the way in carrying out criticism, and directing production on the front lines, thereby promoting rapid development in production. In August, the monthly output of raw coal reached the highest level of the year, with the average daily output increasing by more than 30% compared to before the seizure of power. The tunneling and development progress completed 137% of the state plan.

After the proletarian revolutionaries took power at this mine, they selected a group of cadres from the grassroots level to strengthen the leadership teams for both revolution and production. This seemed to strengthen the leadership, but in reality, it increased the number of people floating above, weakening the leadership at the grassroots level. The workers had opinions about this approach.

The opinions of the broad masses of workers attracted the attention and vigilance of the revolutionary cadres. They studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. They believed that although they spent 24 hours a day eating and sleeping in the office, they had less contact with the masses and production reality, and their relationship with the masses was not as close. Problems reflected from the mine could not be solved in a timely manner. The revolutionary cadre members decided to conduct a rectification campaign. Through the rectification, they further realized that the opinions raised by the masses were a criticism of themselves, indicating that the masses had higher expectations for cadres. Therefore, after the revolutionaries took power, they should change the situation where cadres were detached from the masses. Thus, the military control committee and the revolutionary organization jointly decided that, except for those on duty, all cadres from the mine-level revolutionary and production leadership teams and the original department heads should go to the production front lines, serving as both leaders and workers. This decision was warmly welcomed by the workers. The day after the decision was announced, the coal output of the entire mine saw a new leap.

After the leading cadres went to the production front lines, they organized the workers to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and closely combined learning with criticism. The workers of this mine have already ensured that they hold a one-hour study session before each shift. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadre leaders, masses who were once deceived, and cadres who had made mistakes all sit together to study, inspire each other, and help each other. These meetings are also small-scale criticism and struggle sessions. After each criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, the workers were full of energy and worked like dragons and tigers as soon as they entered the mine.

Through learning, everyone's view of cadres also changed. For cadres who had made mistakes, as long as they were internal contradictions within the people, they were helped, trusted, and boldly used. Now, 90% of the cadres who made mistakes have returned to work, and many continue to hold leadership positions. Now, cadres work together with the workers, and the masses feel that the cadres are of one heart with them. Therefore, when cadres speak, the masses are willing to listen, and production problems are solved promptly.

Now, a new production upsurge is rising at Leap Forward Mine. The entire mine is filled with the roar of machinery, spinning wheels, and the sound of picks and shovels. Good news is frequently reported, and many moving examples have emerged. Many workers use their days off to participate in voluntary labor, and some workers, after completing their shift's production tasks, voluntarily help the next shift's workers. Revolutionary workers say: "Chairman Mao cares about us the most. Now the country needs coal, and we must produce more coal." (Accompanying picture)

### 无产阶级革命派负责人深入第一线　乌达跃进煤矿煤炭生产出现新局面　八月份原煤产量创今年最高水平，掘进、开拓进尺完成计划百分之一百三十七

　　无产阶级革命派负责人深入第一线
　　乌达跃进煤矿煤炭生产出现新局面
　　八月份原煤产量创今年最高水平，掘进、开拓进尺完成计划百分之一百三十七
    本报讯　内蒙古乌达矿区跃进煤矿的无产阶级革命派负责人，坚决执行毛主席提出的既当“官”，又当老百姓的伟大指示，到生产第一线去，带头学习毛主席著作，带头搞大批判，在生产中指挥生产，推动了生产的迅猛发展。八月份原煤月产量创造了今年以来的最高水平，平均日产量比夺权前提高百分之三十以上，掘进、开拓进尺完成国家计划的百分之一百三十七。
    这个矿的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，从基层抽调了一批骨干，充实革命、生产两个领导班子的力量。这样做，看来领导力量似乎增强了，但实际上浮在上面的人多了，削弱了基层的领导力量。工人群众对这种作法有意见。
    广大工人群众的意见，引起了革命派负责人的重视和警惕。他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。他们认为，虽然自己一天二十四小时吃在办公室，睡在办公室，忙得不可开交，但接触群众和生产实际少了，领导和群众的关系不那么亲近了，井下反映上来的问题也不能及时解决。革命派的领导成员决定进行整风。通过整风，他们进一步认识到，群众提出的意见，是对自己的鞭策，说明了群众对干部要求得更严格了。因此，革命派掌权以后，就应该改变过去干部脱离群众的情况。于是，军管会和革命派组织共同研究决定：矿一级革命和生产两个领导班子的干部和原科室的干部除值班的以外，一律到生产第一线去，既当领导，又当工人。这个决定受到工人们热烈的欢迎。决定公布的第二天，全矿煤炭产量出现了新的跃进。
    领导骨干到生产第一线后，认真组织工人活学活用毛主席著作，同时把学习同大批判紧密结合起来。这个矿的工人已经做到每天坚持班前一小时的学习会。革命派工人、革命领导干部、一度受过蒙蔽的群众以及犯过错误的干部，每天坐在一起学习，相互启发，相互帮助。这种会议又是小型的批判斗争会。每次批判了中国赫鲁晓夫后，工人们浑身是劲，一下矿井就生龙活虎般地干起来。
    通过学习，大家对干部的看法也改变了。对于犯过错误的干部，只要是属于人民内部的矛盾，就帮助他们，信任他们，大胆地使用他们。现在百分之九十犯错误的干部已参加了工作，很多人继续担负了领导工作。现在干部同工人一起劳动，群众感到干部同他们是一条心，因而干部讲话，群众乐意听，生产问题解决得又及时。
    现在，一个新的生产高潮正在跃进矿兴起，全矿机器轰鸣，车轮飞转，镐起锹落，捷报频传，涌现了大批动人的事例。许多工人利用假日时间参加义务劳动，有的工人在完成本班生产任务后，又主动地帮助下一班工人。革命工人说：“毛主席最关心我们，现在国家需要煤，我们一定要多出煤。”（附图片）
