Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam delivered an important speech at the extraordinary conference of the Front held in August. Nguyen Huu Tho spoke at length about the excellent situation in South Vietnam, calling on the 14 million people of South Vietnam to continue to strengthen their sacred anti-American, national salvation war until there is not a single American aggressor left on South Vietnamese soil.

Nguyen Huu Tho said in his report that since the birth of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam seven years ago, people from all walks of life in the South have broadly and closely united under the just banner of the National Liberation Front, achieving one strategic victory after another, bringing about profound changes in the situation in the South. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, despite using all sorts of brutal and cunning methods, have attempted to make our people submit, but they have suffered one defeat after another and are increasingly in a passive and desperate situation, and are on the verge of collapse.

He said that the ever-growing victories of the military and people of the South prove that the fighting power of the 14 million people of the South is invincible. In the face of this united force, the desperate struggles of the U.S. imperialists and their lackey clique are like a madman banging his head against a copper wall.

Nguyen Huu Tho said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the leader and organizer of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. It has the ability to rally and unite all patriotic forces in the South under its banner to fulfill the historical mission of defeating the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, overthrowing its puppet regime, establishing a broad national democratic united government, building an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the country.

Nguyen Huu Tho exposed the U.S. imperialists' current plots and actions to intensify their war of aggression and emphasized that the U.S. imperialists are still continuing to use brutal and vicious methods of war in an attempt to make our people submit and maintain their rule. The people of the South, on their way to final victory, must constantly strengthen their fighting will, heighten their vigilance, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and consolidate and expand the great unity of all the people, mobilizing all forces to press forward and defeat the enemy.

Nguyen Huu Tho then elaborated on the five characteristics of the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which was recently adopted. These are: first, a fighting, anti-American, national salvation, and liberation program; second, a program of great unity of all the people; third, a program of nation-building; fourth, a program for the peaceful reunification of the country; fifth, a program of solidarity with the peoples of the world, opposing imperialism led by U.S. imperialism, and striving for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress.

Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that the fighting goal of the people of the South under the leadership of the National Liberation Front is: independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity, and ultimately the peaceful reunification of the country. This is the most urgent and just wish and iron will of the 14 million compatriots in the South. When exposing and condemning the "peace" deception of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, Nguyen Huu Tho said: The American bandits and their lackeys keep shouting about seeking so-called "peace." But the facts show: every time the U.S. imperialists talk about "peace," they strengthen and expand the war. As for the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, they have done nothing but serve the U.S. imperialists' aggression plots.

He said, we love peace very much, but we will never beg for a slave-like "peace." As long as U.S. imperialism still tramples on our country's mountains and rivers, there can be no peace. Therefore, the people of South Vietnam are united and have long been prepared to endure all hardships and sacrifices, resolutely take up arms to fight the enemy and save the country, to struggle for peace. As long as U.S. imperialism still tries to force our people to submit by violence, we will continue to fight until we achieve complete victory.

Nguyen Huu Tho said that U.S. imperialism must understand: for a people who have sworn to sacrifice everything to struggle for independence and freedom, there is no force of brutality that can frighten or overwhelm them. In this long and arduous life-and-death struggle, the victors will surely be the people of South Vietnam.

Nguyen Huu Tho concluded by saying that we, the people of South Vietnam, must vigorously carry forward the great victories we have already achieved, hoist high the banner of great unity of all the people and struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, resolutely press forward to victory, and achieve even greater victories, thereby realizing the liberation of the South, the defense of the North, and ultimately the peaceful reunification of the country.

Nguyen Huu Tho's report was warmly welcomed by the more than 200 representatives present at the conference.

Huynh Tan Phat, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, read the draft political program on behalf of the Central Committee and introduced the spirit of the draft.

The representatives, in their speeches, expressed complete agreement with the draft political program of the National Liberation Front. At the closing meeting, all the representatives present unanimously adopted the political program and the conference communiqué. The conference ended in a festive atmosphere, fully expressing the dauntless spirit and unshakable belief in victory of the people of South Vietnam.

　　阮友寿主席在南越民族解放阵线非常会议上作重要报告
　　号召人民万众一心乘胜前进打败美帝
    新华社河内六日电　据越南南方《解放报》报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿在解放阵线八月间举行的非常会议上作了长篇的重要报告。阮友寿畅谈了越南南方的一片大好形势，他号召一千四百万越南南方人民，继续加强神圣的抗美救国战争，直到在越南南方的土地上，没有一名美国侵略者的时候为止。
    阮友寿在报告中说，自南方民族解放阵线诞生七年来，南方各阶层人民广泛和紧密地团结在民族解放阵线的正义旗帜下，接连取得了具有战略意义的巨大胜利，使南方局势发生了深刻的变化。美帝国主义及其走狗尽管玩弄了一切残暴和狡猾的手段，妄图使我们人民屈服，但它们仍然接连遭到了惨败，日益陷于被动的窘境，并且正在崩溃。
    他说，南方军民取得的日益巨大的胜利，证明了一千四百万南方人民的团结战斗力量是无敌的。在这种团结力量面前，美帝国主义及其走狗集团的一切疯狂挣扎，只能是象疯子一样把头撞在铜墙铁壁上而已。
    阮友寿说，越南南方民族解放阵线是南方人民抗美救国斗争的胜利的领导者和组织者，具有足够能力把南方的所有爱国力量广泛地集合和团结在自己的旗帜下，以便完成历史使命，即打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻它的走狗伪政权，成立广泛的民族民主联合政府，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一自己的祖国。
    阮友寿揭露了美帝国主义目前加强侵略战争的阴谋和行动，并且强调指出，美帝国主义还在继续加紧使用残暴、恶毒的战争手段，妄图使我们的人民屈服，维持它们的统治。南方人民在走向最后胜利的道路上，必须不断增强战斗意志，提高警惕，克服一切艰难困苦，大力巩固和扩大全体人民的大团结，动员一切力量乘胜前进，打败敌人。
    阮友寿接着阐明了最近通过的越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的五个特点，那就是：一、战斗的、抗美救国的、解放民族的纲领；二、全体人民大团结的纲领；三、建国的纲领；四、走向和平统一祖国的纲领；五、同世界人民团结，反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，争取和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的纲领。
    阮友寿指出，南方人民在民族解放阵线领导下的战斗目标是：独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣，进而和平统一祖国。这是南方一千四百万同胞最迫切最正当的愿望和钢铁意志。阮友寿在揭露和谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的“和平”欺骗手段时说：美国强盗及其走狗不断叫嚷要寻求所谓“和平”。但事实表明：美帝国主义每讲一次“和平”，就加强和扩大一次战争。至于阮文绍—阮高其集团，他们除了竭力为美帝国主义的侵略阴谋效劳以外，没有别的作为。
    他说，我们十分热爱和平，但绝不乞求奴隶式的“和平”，只要美帝国主义还蹂躏我们祖国的山河，就不可能有和平，因此，越南南方人民万众一心，早已准备忍受一切艰苦和牺牲，坚决拿起武器杀敌救国，以争取和平。只要美帝国主义还妄图用暴力使我们的人民屈服，我们就要继续战斗到彻底胜利。
    阮友寿说，美帝国主义必须懂得：对于一个已经宣誓准备牺牲一切来争取独立和自由的民族，是没有任何一种残暴势力可以把他们吓倒和压倒的。在这场长期和充满艰苦与牺牲的你死我活的斗争中，胜利者必定是越南南方人民。
    阮友寿最后说，我们越南南方人民，要大力发扬已经取得的巨大胜利，高举全体人民大团结、抗美救国的旗帜，坚决乘胜前进，夺取更加巨大的胜利，从而实现解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
    阮友寿的报告受到出席会议的二百多位代表的热烈欢迎。
    越南南方民族解放阵线主席团副主席兼总书记黄晋发代表中央委员会宣读了政治纲领草案，并且介绍了草案的精神。
    代表们在发言中对民族解放阵线政治纲领草案表示完全赞同。在闭幕会议上，参加会议的全体代表一致通过了政治纲领和会议公报。会议结束时，整个会场一片欢腾，充分表现了越南南方人民决战决胜的大无畏气势和必胜的信念。
