	Firmly and unwaveringly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" uses the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the dialectical materialist viewpoint, and a scientific, combative, and dagger-like style of writing to analyze the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu and his clique, exposing their true colors. This is a crucial battle in the current revolutionary criticism and struggle.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is like the surging current of the Yangtze River, rolling forward. However, the class enemies are desperately struggling in their death throes. Recently, the exposed "May 16" counter-revolutionary organization and its manipulators have inherited Tao Zhu's legacy, using the guise of ultra-leftism to deceive and mislead a portion of the masses influenced by anarchist thinking, secretly engaging in sabotage activities. They attempt to split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to undermine our great People's Liberation Army, to shake the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and to disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. This is absolutely unacceptable to the proletarian revolutionaries.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be particularly vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels." Tao Zhu-like figures and the organizers and manipulators of the "May 16" organization are Khrushchev-like personal careerists and conspirators. They are two-faced; they act like humans during the day and like ghosts at night; they are thieves but pretend to be saints. This is the two-faced tactic of Tao Zhu-like figures and the organizers and manipulators of the "May 16" organization. However, their reactionary essence of opposing the proletarian headquarters and the revolutionary people is impossible to conceal. Their disguised faces not only fail to deceive the revolutionary people but also create the conditions for their own downfall.

	Currently, the class enemies' sabotage of the Cultural Revolution is characterized by diverting the direction of the struggle, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and making the Cultural Revolution deviate from the proletarian revolutionary line. They use ultra-leftist or rightist ideologies to infiltrate the proletarian revolutionaries and attack the proletarian headquarters. They exploit anarchism and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks, using the banner of ultra-leftism but actually rightism, attempting to make the revolutionaries err, and using this as a means to attack the proletarian revolutionaries and bombard the proletarian headquarters. The proletarian revolutionaries must maintain a hundredfold vigilance.

	Lu Xun once said: "One must not be deceived by the cosmetics smeared on the surface, but look at the bones and spine." This is a deeply meaningful statement made by Lu Xun in his struggle against the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Zhou Yang.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In all work departments, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance, be good at identifying those who disguise themselves as supporters of the revolution but are actually against the revolution, and expel them from our various fronts to safeguard the great victories we have already won and will win." Tao Zhu-like figures and the organizers and manipulators of the "May 16" organization are our negative examples for identifying counter-revolutionary two-faced characters now and in the future. The proletarian revolutionaries, armed with the Mao Zedong Thought mirror that can see through everything, will surely learn to identify this type of special creature.

	The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article is an important step in Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must study Chairman Mao's works diligently, seriously study and deeply understand the spirit of this article, firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hold high the banner of "Support the Army and Love the People," firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, focus on the center, and thoroughly and deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle. With revolutionary criticism and struggle as the key, we will do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our unit, and achieve a good revolutionary alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	The proletarian revolutionaries unite, break through all disturbances from the ultra-left and right, and steadfastly, steadfastly, and unwaveringly advance according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

　　坚定不移地紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署
　　北京航空学院“红旗”战斗队
    姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》一文，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用辩证唯物主义观点，用科学的、战斗的、匕首式的文笔，剖析了反革命两面派陶铸及其一伙，使其原形毕露。这是当前革命大批判的总决战中一场极其重要的战役。
    无产阶级文化大革命如长江的洪流，滚滚向前。但是，阶级敌人拚命在作垂死的挣扎。最近，揭发出来的“五·一六”反革命组织及其操纵者，继承了陶铸的衣钵，挂起极“左”的幌子，招摇撞骗，蒙蔽了一部分受无政府主义思潮影响的群众，在暗地里进行阴谋破坏活动，妄图分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，妄图搞垮我们伟大的人民解放军，妄图动摇毛主席和党中央的领导，妄图搅乱毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是我们无产阶级革命派绝对不能容许的。
    毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”陶铸式的人物以及“五·一六”的组织者和操纵者，就是赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家和阴谋家。他们阴一套，阳一套；白天装人，黑夜是鬼；明明是贼，偏装圣贤。这就是陶铸式的人物以及“五·一六”的组织者和操纵者的阴阳手法。但是，他们反对无产阶级司令部，反对革命人民的反动本质是掩盖不住的，他们伪装的面孔，不但不能欺骗革命人民，反而为他们自己的垮台造成条件。
    当前，阶级敌人破坏文化大革命的特点，就是转移斗争大方向，打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署，使文化大革命背离无产阶级革命路线。他们用极“左”的或右的思潮，侵蚀无产阶级革命派，冲击无产阶级司令部。他们利用革命队伍中的无政府主义和小资产阶级派性，打着极“左”而实质极右的旗号，妄图使革命派犯错误，以此作为攻击无产阶级革命派，炮打无产阶级司令部的手段，无产阶级革命派对此必须保持百倍警惕。
    鲁迅曾经说过：“必须不被搽在表面的自欺欺人的脂粉所诓骗，却看看他的筋骨和脊梁。”这是鲁迅在同反革命两面派周扬的斗争中说出的含意极其深刻的话。
    毛主席教导我们说：“必须在各个工作部门中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去，这样来保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利。”陶铸式的人物及“五·一六”的组织者和操纵者是我们现在和今后识别反革命两面派的反面教员。无产阶级革命派掌握了能够明察秋毫的毛泽东思想的照妖镜，一定能够学会识别这一类特殊动物的“本领”。
    姚文元同志文章的发表，是毛主席的伟大战略部署的一个重要步骤，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，认真学习和深刻领会这篇文章的精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，抓住中心，扎扎实实，深入地开展革命的大批判。以革命的大批判为纲，搞好本单位的斗批改，搞好革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，冲破一切从极“左”和右的方面来的扰乱，坚定，坚定，坚定不移地按照毛主席的伟大战略部署乘胜前进。
