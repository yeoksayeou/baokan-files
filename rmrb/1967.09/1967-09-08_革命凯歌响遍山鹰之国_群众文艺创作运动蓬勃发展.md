The song of victory echoes through the land of the eagle
The mass art creation movement flourishes

With the rapid development of the revolutionization movement, mass literary and artistic creation has become increasingly prosperous. Recently, the Writers and Artists Association admitted fifty-eight new members and established many literary groups among the masses. For example, the Ferri Cultural Palace set up a literary group composed of workers, peasants, and students. The city of Berat established a troupe for satirical plays. The "Stalin Textile Factory" in Tirana set up a literary group of twenty workers and published a literary newsletter called "Literary Youth," among other initiatives.

In the "Sickle and Hammer Woolen Mill" in Korça, three hundred fifty workers participated in literary and musical creation, producing two hundred poems and songs, six satirical plays, and five one-act or multi-act dramas in a short period. The long poem "Turning Barren Mountains into Fertile Fields" by Dedë Jonu, a member of the agricultural cooperative and a folk singer, is widely circulated in rural areas and has powerfully promoted the agricultural collectivization movement in the mountainous regions. The twenty-year-old youth member Xhevat Morosi wrote the novel "Birds Spread Their Wings," reflecting the construction of new rural villages by young people in the mountains; the young worker Rilind Duka completed the libretto for the opera "Sunlight of the East," enthusiastically praising the laborers building the Logar-Ferri railway. Additionally, Peshkopi published a collection of amateur works by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the satirical play troupe successfully wrote the play "Stars Shining Bright." The Skodra Cable Factory held an exhibition of workers' artworks, displaying sixty-one excellent pieces.

Since the start of the Logar-Ferri railway project, the "Voice of Youth" newspaper added a special edition for "Volunteer Laborers." The youth can both work and write poems and articles. Many excellent works praising labor and the Labor Party are continuously published in the newspaper, with some works like "The Red Flag of Labor Flutters Everywhere" receiving high praise.

Today, in heroic Albania, a beautiful scene of revolutionization is presented everywhere. The song of victory echoes through the land of the eagle!

　　革命凯歌响遍山鹰之国
    群众文艺创作运动蓬勃发展
    随着革命化运动的迅速发展，群众性的文艺创作也日益繁荣。不久前，作家艺术家协会发展了五十八名新会员，在群众中间建立了许多文学小组。例如，费里文化宫成立了由工人、农民和学生组成的文学小组。培拉特市成立了杂剧队。地拉那“斯大林纺织厂”成立了由二十名工人组成的文学小组，办了文学小报《文学青年》等等。
    在科尔察“镰刀与锤子毛纺织厂”组织的文艺创作队伍里，有三百五十名工人参加了文学、音乐创作，在很短的时间里他们写出了二百首诗和歌曲、六组杂剧、五出独幕或多幕的话剧。农业社社员、民间歌手戴代·焦尼写的长诗《把荒山变良田》在农村中广泛流传，有力地推动了山区的农业合作化运动。二十岁的青年社员薛区里·茂罗斯写出了反映山村青年建设新农村的长篇小说《群鸟展翅》；青年工人里尔密·都卡伊完成了歌剧本《东方的阳光》，热情地歌颂了建设洛格齐恩—费里铁路的劳动者。此外，彼什可比也出版了工农兵业余创作小册子，杂剧团成功地写出了话剧《星光闪闪》。斯库台市电缆厂举办工人美术作品展览会，展出优秀作品六十一件。
    自从洛格齐恩—费里铁路工程开工以来，《青年之声报》增加了《义务劳动者》专刊，青年们既能劳动，又能写诗作文章，许多歌颂劳动、劳动党的优秀作品源源不绝地发表在报纸上，有的作品如《劳动的红旗漫天飘扬》得到了极高评价。
    今天，在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚到处都呈现出一片革命化的美好景象。革命的凯歌响遍了山鹰之国！
