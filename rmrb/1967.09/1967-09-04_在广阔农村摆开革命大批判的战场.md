The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved brilliant victories. At this crucial juncture in the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee, at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, analyzed the excellent revolutionary situation for us and issued the important battle command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters.

After more than a year of proletarian cultural revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices have been exposed. The counter-revolutionary line headed by the Chinese Khrushchev is on the verge of total collapse. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. However, the political, ideological, and theoretical poison left by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices has not yet been thoroughly eliminated. The thorough criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and the thorough elimination of their poison, is a major issue concerning whether our country will take the socialist road or the capitalist road, and a major issue concerning the world revolution. Therefore, whether we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism is a serious test for every poor and lower-middle peasant. As long as the revolutionary masses of every unit concentrate their firepower and carry out revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will have no place to hide and will be thoroughly finished.

We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to firmly follow the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, eliminate all interference, and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism on a larger scale throughout the suburbs, making every commune, production brigade, village, street, and field a battlefield for criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. We will wage a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrow and expose them, and eliminate the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the agricultural front, turning the entire countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

While carrying out revolutionary criticism, we poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," using revolutionary criticism as a driving force to engage in the intense battle of the "three autumns," seize a bumper harvest for the entire year, and strive to implement Chairman Mao's great decision of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggles against the revolutionary forces." When we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry out revolutionary criticism, we must not forget the class enemies. They sense that their death is imminent and will undoubtedly try every means to counterattack. At present, they are attempting to shake the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao from the right or the ultra-"left" side. They instigate armed struggles, sow discord between the military and the people, and direct their spears at the great People's Liberation Army of China.

We must remain highly vigilant against all this, be ready to smash their plots at any time, and defend to the death the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, defend to the death our great leader Chairman Mao, defend to the death Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, defend to the death the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

　　在广阔农村摆开革命大批判的战场
　　北京市贫下中农代表会议常设委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了辉煌胜利。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的重要关头，党中央负责同志在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上，给我们分析了革命的大好形势，发出了毛主席的无产阶级司令部的重要战斗号令。
    经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙被揪出来了，以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命阵线正走向全面崩溃。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙在政治上、思想上、理论上的流毒还远没有肃清。对以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的彻底批判，彻底肃清他们的流毒，是关系到我国走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题，是关系到世界革命的大事情。因此，能不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，是对我们每个贫下中农的严重考验。只要每个单位的革命群众，都集中火力，开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，中国的赫鲁晓夫以及党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就毫无藏身之地，就会彻底完蛋。
    我们贫下中农，决心坚定不移地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，排除一切干扰，在整个郊区掀起一个更大规模的革命大批判的新高潮，让所有社、队，让村庄、街头、地头，都成为批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内走资本主义道路当权派的战场，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”，彻底把中国的赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透，斗倒、斗臭，肃清他们在农业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，把整个农村变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    在革命大批判的同时，我们贫下中农坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以革命的大批判为动力，投入“三秋”大忙的紧张战斗，夺取全年农业生产大丰收，努力实现毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大决策。
    毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。我们在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展革命大批判的时候，决不能忘记阶级敌人。他们预感到自己的死亡即将到来，一定会千方百计进行反扑。目前，他们正企图从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。他们挑起武斗，挑拨军民关系，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军。
    对这一切，我们一定要保持高度的革命警惕，要随时粉碎他们的阴谋，誓死保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，誓死保卫伟大领袖毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
