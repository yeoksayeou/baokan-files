Approximately seven thousand workers, students, and other people from various walks of life in Sudan held a demonstration march in Khartoum on August 30, shouting slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with the running dogs of the United States!" "Armed struggle is the only way to defeat American imperialism and Israel!" and so on.

The demonstrators marched from the southern part of Khartoum to the Constitutional Assembly Building, where they handed a memorandum to the Secretariat of the Arab Summit Conference, demanding that they take active measures to oppose the aggression of imperialism and Israel.

A leader of a mass organization told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "The urgent task facing the Arab world at present is to mobilize the broad masses to wage a protracted people's war against U.S.-Israeli aggression. He said, "We must carry the struggle through to the end. There is absolutely no room for compromise."

A student named Sara told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "Although we suffered setbacks in the military field during the recent war, the political consciousness and fighting spirit of the people have reached a higher level. This is more important than weapons." He emphasized, "The recent difficulties have tested who are true friends and who are false friends. The Arab people have become more aware that American imperialism is their main enemy, and the Soviet revisionist leaders are accomplices of the U.S. imperialists. It is most important to distinguish between enemies and friends, as Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of primary importance in the revolution.'"

An old worker said, "Apart from following the road of Mao Zedong, there is no other way for us Arab people to eliminate the U.S.-Israeli aggressors." He then took out a red "Little Red Book" of Chairman Mao's quotations from his pocket and read a passage: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war."

On August 29, thousands of students in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum held an anti-American demonstration march on the streets a few hours before the opening of the Arab Summit Conference. The demonstrators held up signs reading "American imperialism is the enemy of the Arab people" and shouted slogans such as "Down with American and British imperialism!" and "Down with Israel!"

A student who participated in the demonstration told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "The only way for the Arab people to deal with aggression is armed struggle, not peace talks." An older government official said, "During the recent imperialist aggression against the Arab people, the Soviet Union colluded with the United States to jointly plot aggression, while China stood up for us Arab people with great justice. Comparing these facts, all the Sudanese people deeply believe that China is a true friend of the Arab people." A Palestinian journalist covering the conference emphasized, "We Palestinian people believe that the revolutionary road of China—people's war—is also the road to our victory."

When the demonstrators saw the Chinese journalists wearing Chairman Mao badges, they enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Republic of China!"

　　打倒美帝国主义！打倒以色列！
　　苏丹人民连日举行大规模反美示威游行
　　示威群众高呼“毛主席万岁！人民中国万岁！”
    据新华社喀土穆电　约七千苏丹工人、学生和其他阶层人民八月三十日在这里举行示威游行，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒美国走狗！”“武装斗争是打败美帝国主义和以色列的唯一道路！”等口号。
    示威者从喀土穆的城南游行到制宪议会大厦，他们向在那里正在开会的阿拉伯国家首脑会议的秘书处递交了一份备忘录，要求采取积极行动，反对帝国主义和以色列的侵略。
    一位群众团体的负责人向新华社记者说，当前阿拉伯世界面临的紧急任务是动员广大群众进行反对美国—以色列侵略的持久的人民战争。他说：“我们应该把斗争坚持到底，根本没有妥协的余地。”
    一位名叫萨拉的学生向新华社记者说：“虽然我们在最近战争期间，在军事方面遭受到挫折，但是，人民的政治觉悟和战斗精神已经达到更高的水平。这是比武器更重要的。”他强调说：“最近的困难考验了谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。阿拉伯人民更加清楚地认识到美帝国主义是他们的主要敌人，苏修领导人是美帝的帮凶。划清敌友界限是最重要的事，正如毛主席教导我们的：‘谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。’”
    一位老工人说：“我们阿拉伯人民除了走毛泽东的道路外，没有别的办法消灭美国—以色列侵略者。”他然后从口袋里拿出一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，并读了一段语录：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    八月二十九日苏丹首都喀土穆数千名学生群众，在阿拉伯国家首脑会议开幕前几小时在大街上举行反美示威游行。示威者手持“美帝国主义是阿拉伯人的敌人”的标语牌，高呼“打倒美英帝国主义！”和“打倒以色列！”等口号。
    一个参加示威的学生对新华社记者说：“我们阿拉伯人民对付侵略的唯一途径是武装斗争，而不是和平谈判”。一位上年纪的政府工作人员说：“在最近帝国主义侵略阿拉伯人民时，苏联同美国勾结在一起，共同密谋侵略，而中国则大义凛然地支持我们阿拉伯人民。拿这些事实一比较，全体苏丹人民深深相信，中国是阿拉伯人民的真朋友。”一位采访会议消息的巴勒斯坦记者强调指出：“我们巴勒斯坦人民相信，中国革命的道路——人民战争——也是我们走向胜利的道路。”
    示威群众看到中国记者佩戴的毛主席像章时，热情地高呼“毛主席万岁！人民中国万岁！”
