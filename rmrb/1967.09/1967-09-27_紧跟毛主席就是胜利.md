The surging tide of revolutionary unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism sweeps across the country, from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall, and is unstoppable. Amidst this excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have received the joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao's successful inspection tour of North China, Central China, and East China. Chairman Mao has once again come among the people, showing his greatest concern and encouragement to all the military and civilian personnel of the nation. We feel the greatest happiness. We shout with all our might a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. At every critical moment, it is our great helmsman Chairman Mao who repeatedly corrects our course, steering the revolutionary ship through stormy seas, advancing steadily toward victory.

Last June and July, the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party launched a bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to extinguish the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this crucial moment, our great leader Chairman Mao timely convened the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, declaring the failure of the bourgeois reactionary line and guiding the hundreds of millions of revolutionary soldiers and civilians to advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line.

As soon as the "January Revolution" storm arose in Shanghai, our great leader Chairman Mao immediately, with the greatest resolve, pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage—seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party—and achieved great victories.

We must pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength. Chairman Mao has called on us to launch a revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and exposing Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters, uprooting the source of revisionism, and ensuring that the socialist state will never change color. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary soldiers and civilians have executed Chairman Mao's instructions most resolutely and followed him most closely. Everyone takes up the pen as a weapon and marches to the battlefield of revolutionary criticism.

The class enemy will not accept defeat. They change their appearance and launch attacks from both the "ultra-left" and right sides, attempting to shake the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, split and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, and disrupt our revolutionary struggle's direction. At this crucial moment, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has issued an important battle order, calling on us to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply launch revolutionary criticism, develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our units. The hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians further follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing victoriously and smashing the plots of the domestic and foreign class enemies.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have expressed the hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries. Everyone resolutely implements them, and a new high tide of revolutionary unity has quickly surged across the country. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is getting better and better.

Looking back at these battles, we are deeply moved, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" from the bottom of our hearts a thousand times. Event after event tells us an unshakable truth: What is victory? Following our great leader Chairman Mao is victory! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are our supreme commander, you are the eternal red sun in our hearts. We revolutionary soldiers resolutely listen to your words, and we are determined to follow the path you point out. We will definitely follow your guidance, bravely forge ahead, and pledge to be your most loyal and brave guards, the strongest support for the proletarian revolutionaries, and the strongest defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
　　驻京三军无产阶级革命派　兵颂东
    大江南北，长城内外，在革命大批判中实现革命大联合的洪流，汹涌澎湃，不可阻挡。就在这无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势下，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区胜利归来的大喜讯。毛主席又一次来到群众中间，这是对我们全国军民最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞。我们感到最大的幸福。我们一千遍一万遍地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    伟大的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的，是在毛主席亲自领导下进行的。在每一个关键时刻，都是伟大舵手毛主席一次又一次为我们端正航向，使革命巨轮冲破惊涛骇浪，不停地胜利前进。
    去年六、七月间，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派抛出资产阶级反动路线，妄图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。在这个关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席及时召开了党的八届十一中全会，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，指引着亿万革命军民沿着无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
      “一月革命”风暴刚从上海兴起，我们伟大领袖毛主席立即以最伟大的气魄把无产阶级文化大革命推进到新的阶段，就是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的阶段，取得了伟大的胜利。
    宜将剩勇追穷寇。毛主席又号召我们开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，挖掉修正主义根子，保证社会主义江山永不变色。亿万革命军民，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的指示，执行得最坚决，跟得最紧。人人拿起笔作刀枪，杀向革命大批判的战场。
    阶级敌人是不会甘心失败的。他们改头换装，从极“左”和右的两方面发动进攻，妄图动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，分化瓦解革命队伍，扰乱我们革命斗争的大方向。正在这个重要关头，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部又发出重要的战斗号令，号召我们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，深入开展革命的大批判，发展和巩固革命的大联合和“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改。亿万军民进一步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署乘胜前进，粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的阴谋。
    最近，我们伟大领袖毛主席又发出了最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的最新指示，说出了无产阶级革命派的心里话。大家坚决照办，很快就在全国范围内掀起了革命大联合的新高潮，无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。
    回想这些战斗的历程，我们激动万分，“毛主席万岁！”从心底呼了千万遍。一桩桩一件件事情汇集起来，告诉了我们这样一个颠扑不破的真理：什么是胜利？紧跟我们伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！毛主席呵，毛主席！您是我们的最高司令，您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳，您的话我们革命战士坚决听，您指的道路我们走定了。我们一定要沿着您指引的航向，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，披荆斩棘，奋勇向前，誓作您的最忠诚最勇敢的卫士，誓作无产阶级革命派最坚强的后盾，誓作无产阶级文化大革命最强大的捍卫者！
