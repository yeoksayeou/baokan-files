The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing, which have been carrying out the task of supporting the left in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises, recently held two political work conferences under the leadership of the Beijing Garrison. These conferences extensively exchanged experiences on how to help the proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres in these enterprises to carry out revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary great alliance, and implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Since early March, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison and the units stationed in Beijing have arrived at industrial and mining enterprises in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Over the past six months, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely supported the broad masses of the left, and made new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises. Currently, revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously in many units, and revolutionary great alliance has been developed and consolidated in many departments during the revolutionary criticism. In many large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises such as the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant, Beijing Wire Factory, Shijingshan Power Plant, Water Supply Company, Jingxi Coal Mine, and the No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, which have nearly a thousand or several thousand workers, revolutionary great alliance has been achieved or initially achieved. Some have already established revolutionary committees, achieving revolutionary great alliance based on workshops, shifts, and departments.

At the political work conference, the officers and soldiers who have fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions spoke from their personal experiences about the great significance of promoting revolutionary great alliance during the revolutionary criticism. They said that revolutionary great alliance is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and a crucial condition for ensuring the completion of all tasks of the proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao teaches: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." Without revolutionary great alliance, it is impossible to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, complete the glorious task of struggle-criticism-transformation in the unit, or achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The officers and soldiers believe that to do this work well, a lot of painstaking and meticulous work must be done. They introduced many good experiences in this regard at the meeting.

Before March of this year, the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant had strong opposition between the two major factions. After the supporting-left officers and soldiers entered the factory, they first conducted in-depth and meticulous investigations and research, distinguishing that one side was a revolutionary mass organization, while the other side's many masses had not clearly drawn a line with the bourgeois reactionary line and had not clearly recognized the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party in the unit. The officers and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, first educated the proletarian revolutionary factions to stop "internal warfare," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively participate in revolutionary criticism, and deeply expose the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and the capitalist-roaders within the factory. Due to the in-depth and meticulous investigations and research by the proletarian revolutionary factions, each criticism and struggle meeting peeled off a layer of the disguise of the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, immediately causing a batch of masses to withdraw from their original organizations and join the revolutionary mass organizations. With the strong support and help of the officers and soldiers, the criticism meetings were held continuously for more than ten times, finally making the vast majority of masses draw a clear line with the capitalist-roaders and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, the factory has established a unified revolutionary organization and is working to unite based on workshops, shifts, and teams, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

Before March, the Beijing Wire Factory had three mass organizations in opposition to each other, fighting incessantly. After the officers and soldiers entered the factory, to promote the revolutionary great alliance of the entire factory, they immediately went to the workshops, worked alongside the workers, and had heart-to-heart talks with them, learning that the masses in the three mass organizations all hoped to achieve revolutionary great alliance. They then called the leaders of each organization to a joint meeting, using Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism to inspire and guide them to conduct self-criticism. At the meeting, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations that had emerged from the bourgeois reactionary line first took the initiative to check their errors of "only I am left" and arrogance. The leader of another organization also admitted the errors made in the struggle between the two lines. By the fourth joint meeting, the two organizations united based on the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, establishing a unified revolutionary mass organization. The unification of these two organizations had a great impact on the masses in the other organization. When they learned that the reason for not uniting was the leaders of their organization, they all requested to rectify their organization. The officers and soldiers firmly supported the revolutionary masses' request and conducted education and specific help on the two-line struggle, finally making their leaders recognize their serious errors and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. During this period, the proletarian revolutionary faction fighters, to support their class brothers in raising their consciousness early, took the initiative to replace them in production, allowing them to hold good rectification meetings. Now, the Beijing Wire Factory, in the midst of deepening revolutionary criticism, has established a revolutionary organization throughout the factory, uniting from bottom to top based on workshops and teams.

The "Red Rebel Corps" of the No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, emerged from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, seized power in the January revolutionary storm, and bravely shouldered the dual burden of revolution and production. The revolutionary situation was excellent, and production gradually increased, with the monthly output of locomotives and freight cars both exceeding historical highs. However, the "Red Rebel Corps" also made serious errors in the power seizure struggle, fighting many masses, causing serious opposition between some worker masses and the "Red Rebel Corps." Facing this situation, the supporting-left officers and soldiers first studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and Chairman Mao's brilliant works on the five conditions for successors with the "Red Rebel Corps," helping them rectify their organization, making them recognize the serious errors made after seizing power, and inspiring them to actively check with the broad masses and apologize to the masses they had persecuted. The leaders of this organization visited the homes of those they had persecuted three or five times, checking their errors and expressing their desire to strengthen unity and jointly fight the enemy. At the same time, with the help of the officers and soldiers, they did painstaking and meticulous ideological work on the deceived masses, studying "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and Vice Chairman Lin's related instructions with them, greatly raising the consciousness of the two-line struggle among the deceived masses, and making them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in droves.

At the political work conference, the officers and soldiers introduced many good experiences of industrial and mining enterprises achieving revolutionary great alliance. The officers and soldiers seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. They are determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, work together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary workers in industrial and mining enterprises, do a good job in revolutionary criticism, further develop and consolidate revolutionary great alliance, be models of revolutionary criticism, models of revolutionary great alliance, and models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

    北京卫戍区召开政工会议，总结帮助工矿企业
    实现革命大联合经验实现革命大联合，进一步搞好斗批改
    据新华社十六日讯在首都工矿企业中执行支左任务的中国人民解放军各部队，最近在北京卫戍区的领导下，连续举行了两次政治工作会议，广泛交流了如何帮助工矿企业无产阶级革命派、革命职工、革命干部开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命“三结合”的经验。
    北京卫戍区和驻京部队广大指战员，是三月初遵照毛主席的指示分别到达工矿企业的。在这半年多的时间里，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决地支持了左派广大群众，为首都工矿企业的无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的贡献。现在，许多单位革命的大批判开展得轰轰烈烈，许多部门在革命大批判中发展和巩固了革命大联合。北京外文印刷厂、北京钢丝厂、石景山发电厂、自来水公司、京西长沟峪煤矿、二七机车车辆工厂等许多拥有近千人或几千人的大中型工矿企业，已经实现和初步实现了革命的大联合，其中有的已经成立了革命委员会，实现了按车间、班组、部门为基础的革命大联合。
    在政工会议上，与无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的指战员们，都以切身的体会，畅谈了在革命的大批判中大力促进革命大联合的伟大意义。他们说，革命的大联合，是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，是保证无产阶级文化大革命的各项任务能够胜利完成的重要条件。毛主席教导说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”没有革命的大联合，就不能深入地进行革命的大批判，完成本单位斗批改的光荣任务；就不能实现革命的“三结合”。指战员们认为，要做好这方面的工作，必须进行许多艰苦细致的工作。他们在会上介绍了许多这方面的好经验。
    北京外文印刷厂今年三月以前，两大派组织对立情绪很大。支左的指战员进厂后，首先作了深入细致的调查研究，分清了一方是革命群众组织，另一方的许多群众同资产阶级反动路线划不清界限，对本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派认识不清。指战员们根据毛主席的教导，首先教育无产阶级革命派停止“内战”，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极投入革命的大批判，深入揭发中国赫鲁晓夫、彭真反革命修正主义集团和本厂走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。由于无产阶级革命派调查研究深入细致，每开一次批判斗争会，就剥掉一层党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，立即就有一批群众退出原来的组织，参加革命群众组织。在指战员的大力支持和帮助下，大批判会连续开了十多次，终于使绝大多数群众同走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。现在，这个厂已经建立了统一的革命组织，正在按车间、班、组联合起来，掀起革命大批判的新高潮。
    北京钢丝厂在三月份以前，有三个群众组织互相对立，“内战”打个不休。指战员进厂后，为了促进全厂的革命大联合，立即深入到车间，一边劳动，一边同职工群众谈心，了解到三个群众组织中的群众都是希望实现革命大联合的。他们就把各个组织的负责人召集在一起开联席会，用毛主席关于开展批评与自我批评的教导，启发诱导他们进行自我批评。会上，从资产阶级反动路线下冲杀出来的革命群众组织负责人，首先主动检查了“唯我独左”、骄傲自满等错误。另一个组织的负责人也承认了过去在两条路线斗争中所犯的一些错误。联席会开到第四次，这两个组织就本着求大同存小异的原则，联合起来建立了统一的革命群众组织。这两个组织统一起来，对另一个组织中的群众震动很大，当他们了解到不能联合的原因在于他们组织的负责人以后，就纷纷要求在内部整风。指战员们坚决支持了革命群众的要求，并且对他们进行了两条路线斗争教育和具体帮助，终于使他们的负责人认识到自己所犯的严重错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。在这期间，无产阶级革命派战士为了支持阶级兄弟早日提高觉悟，主动顶替他们生产，让他们开好整风会。现在，北京钢丝厂在深入开展的革命大批判中，已经成立了全厂的革命组织，从下到上按车间、班组联合起来了。
    二七机车车辆工厂的“红色造反团”在毛主席的革命路线指引下，从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中冲杀了出来，在一月革命风暴中夺了权，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，革命形势大好，生产逐步上升，机车、货车的月产量都超过了历史的最高水平。但是“红色造反团”在夺权斗争中也犯了严重的错误，斗了许多群众，造成一些工人群众和“红色造反团”之间的严重对立。支左的指战员面对着这种情况，首先同“红色造反团”一起学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《将革命进行到底》和毛主席关于接班人五个条件等光辉著作，帮助他们整风，使他们认识夺权以后所犯的严重错误，并且启发他们主动地向广大群众作检查，向被自己整过的群众赔礼道歉。这个组织的负责人有的三番五次地到被自己整过的群众家里访问，检查错误，表示要加强团结，共同对敌。同时，在指战员的帮助下，对受蒙蔽的群众作了艰苦细致的思想工作，和他们一起学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》和林副主席的有关指示，使受蒙蔽的群众大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，纷纷回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    在政工会议上，指战员们介绍了不少工矿企业实现革命大联合的好经验。指战员们认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。决心按照伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，同工矿企业无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工一道，搞好革命的大批判，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合，作革命大批判的模范，作革命大联合的模范，作“抓革命，促生产”的模范。
