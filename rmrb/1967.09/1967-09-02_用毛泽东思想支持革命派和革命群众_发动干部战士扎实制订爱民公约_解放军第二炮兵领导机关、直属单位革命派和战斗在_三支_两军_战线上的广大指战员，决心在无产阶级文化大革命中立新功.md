In the fervent movement of supporting the army and loving the people, the revolutionary cadres and soldiers of the leadership organs and directly affiliated units of the Second Artillery Corps of the People's Liberation Army, as well as those engaged in the "Three Supports, Two Military" front, are seriously formulating "Love for the People Pacts."

The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers of this unit, in the process of formulating the "Love for the People Pacts," are making even greater efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's instructions on "supporting the army and loving the people." They are mobilizing the masses more extensively, summarizing experiences and lessons in loving the people, so as to formulate solid and practical "Love for the People Pacts." They say that the process of formulating the "Love for the People Pacts" is a process of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively applying Chairman Mao's works; it is a process of summarizing experiences and lessons in loving the people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is a process of promoting ideological revolutionization and transforming one's world outlook. Therefore, in the past few days, they have been even more diligent in actively applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, mobilizing the masses deeply, analyzing situations, finding problems, and summarizing experiences and lessons. The cadres and soldiers engaged in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work and the revolutionary mass organizations in the factories, schools, and other places where they are stationed, hold discussion meetings and heart-to-heart talks, humbly listening to the criticisms of the masses. In a middle school in Beijing where the cadres and soldiers are carrying out military training tasks, in addition to mobilizing revolutionary teachers and students to give opinions on the basis of teaching classes, they also specially convened a discussion meeting attended by Red Guards revolutionary little generals, revolutionary teachers, and staff, soliciting opinions. They classified and sorted out the opinions from all directions, summarizing several aspects of the problems. Then, with these problems in mind, they further actively applied Chairman Mao's works, deeply understood the brilliant thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao on "supporting the army and loving the people," discussed views, expressed opinions, revealed viewpoints, dug out the roots, found the causes, carried out criticism and self-criticism, raised awareness, and raised political consciousness to formulate a good "Love for the People Pact."

On the basis of raising awareness and consciousness, the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers, in accordance with the main problems existing in the work of loving the people, combined with the specific tasks undertaken by their units or individuals, formulated practical and feasible "Love for the People Pacts." The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit executing military training tasks also handed over their "Love for the People Pacts" to revolutionary teachers and students, extensively soliciting opinions. They also, according to the opinions of revolutionary teachers and students, stipulated that the implementation of the "Love for the People Pacts" be checked once a month.

In the process of formulating the "Love for the People Pacts," the revolutionary cadres and soldiers of the leadership organs and directly affiliated units of the Second Artillery Corps, and those engaged in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, have received a vivid education in Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone deeply feels that the most important thing in formulating the "Love for the People Pacts" is to support all proletarian revolutionary cadres, all Red Guards revolutionary little generals, and all revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers expressed that they would resolutely respond to the great call of Comrade Lin Biao, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," urgently addressing the concerns of the revolutionary cadres, thinking about the needs of the revolutionary cadres, helping the revolutionary cadres with what they need, and closely uniting with and fighting alongside the broad masses of the left, striving to achieve new victories in loving the people, striving to be models in loving the people, and swearing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    新华社三十一日讯　在热烈的拥军爱民运动中，中国人民解放军第二炮兵领导机关、直属单位无产阶级革命派，和战斗在“三支”“两军”战线上的广大指战员，正在十分认真地制定“爱民公约”。
    这个部队的广大指战员，在制定“爱民公约”的过程中，更加努力学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席“拥军爱民”的指示，更加广泛地发动群众，总结爱民的经验教训，以便订出扎扎实实、切实可行的“爱民公约”。他们说，制订“爱民公约”的过程，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的过程；是总结无产阶级文化大革命中爱民的经验、教训的过程；是促进思想革命化、改造世界观的过程。因此，几天来，他们更加勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入发动群众，摆情况，找问题，总结经验教训。参加“三支”“两军”工作的指战员和所在的工厂、学校等的革命群众组织，召开座谈会，谈心会，虚心听取群众的批评。在北京市一个中学执行军训任务的指战员，除以教学班为单位，广泛发动革命师生提意见外，还专门召开有红卫兵革命小将、革命教师、员工等参加的座谈会，征求意见。他们把来自四面八方的意见，分类排队，归纳几个方面的问题。然后带着这些问题，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，深入领会伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的光辉思想，谈认识，摆看法，亮观点，挖根子，找原因，开展批评与自我批评，提高认识，提高政治觉悟，来订好“爱民公约”。
    广大指战员在提高认识和觉悟的基础上，针对爱民工作中存在的主要问题，结合本单位或个人所担负的具体任务，制订了切实可行的“爱民公约”。执行军训任务的某部指战员，还把自己的“爱民公约”交给革命师生，广泛征求意见。并根据革命师生的意见，规定每月检查一次“爱民公约”执行情况。
    在制订“爱民公约”的过程中，第二炮兵领导机关、直属单位的无产阶级革命派和参加“三支”“两军”工作的干部战士，受到了一次活生生的毛泽东思想的教育。大家深深的体会到：制订爱民公约，最重要的，是用毛泽东思想支持一切无产阶级革命派、一切红卫兵革命小将和一切革命群众。指战员们表示，要坚决响应林副统帅“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召，急革命派所急，想革命派所想，帮革命派所需，和左派广大群众紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，争立爱民新功，争当爱民模范，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
