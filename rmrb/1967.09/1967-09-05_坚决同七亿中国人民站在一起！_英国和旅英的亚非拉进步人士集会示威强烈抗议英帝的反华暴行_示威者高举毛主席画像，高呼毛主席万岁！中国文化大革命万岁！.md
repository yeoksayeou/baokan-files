Resolutely Stand with the 700 Million People of China!
British and Overseas Asian, African, and Latin American Progressives Hold Rally and Demonstration to Strongly Protest British Imperialism's Anti-China Atrocities
Demonstrators Hold Up Portraits of Chairman Mao, Chant "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live the Chinese Cultural Revolution!"

	According to Xinhua News Agency, London, September 4th: Several hundred progressive individuals from Britain and Asia, Africa, and Latin America residing in Britain held a rally today and marched through the streets of London, strongly protesting the savage suppression by British imperialism of Hong Kong's Chinese residents and the beating of personnel at the Chinese Office in London. The demonstrators carried numerous large portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and chanted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!", "Down with British Imperialism!", "Down with American Imperialism!", "Down with Soviet Revisionism!", "Hong Kong is Chinese territory!", "British workers condemn the fascist actions of British police!", and "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

	When the demonstration reached the vicinity of the Chinese Office, they were blocked by a large number of British police surrounding the office. At this point, the demonstrators waved copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted in unison, "Down with British Imperialism!", "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

	After a struggle, representatives of the demonstrators finally entered the Chinese Office and handed over a resolution passed earlier at the mass meeting, expressing their most resolute support for the Chinese people. They were warmly received by the staff of the Chinese Office in London, led by Acting Head of Office Shen Ping, and together they read quotations from Chairman Mao and chanted revolutionary slogans.

	The demonstration then proceeded to 10 Downing Street to deliver their resolution condemning British imperialism's anti-China fascist atrocities to the British Prime Minister.

	The rally and march were organized by the "Friends of China Society", the "Indian Workers Association in Britain", and other organizations, as well as individuals friendly to China. The participants, from beginning to end, demonstrated their boundless love for Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and the solid unity between the British people and the Chinese people, as well as between the revolutionary peoples of various countries.

	Before the march, a mass meeting was held. The meeting began with all participants reciting a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world must have courage to oppose and must not fear difficulties. They must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

	Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned British imperialism's anti-China atrocities. They pointed out that British imperialism's frenzied anti-China actions in Hong Kong and London were due to their extreme fear of the great thought of Mao Zedong.

	The meeting passed a resolution strongly condemning the British authorities for dispatching fascist police to beat Chinese diplomatic personnel, and noted that this atrocity had aroused the anger of progressive individuals and all revolutionary people in Britain. The resolution stated: "The fascist actions of the British imperialist authorities are a new crime of escalating anti-China movements and serving U.S. imperialism, thereby incurring new blood debts to the 700 million Chinese people."

	The resolution expressed respect for revolutionary Chinese diplomats, saying: "Chinese diplomats armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong have waged a struggle against fascist thugs. Their great heroism and indomitable spirit are a great inspiration to all revolutionary people, especially to the British working class who are fighting against the attacks of the monopolistic capitalists and their mouthpiece, the Labour government." The resolution also fully supported the four serious demands made by Acting Head of Office Shen Ping to the British government regarding the serious incident of British police beating Chinese diplomatic personnel.

	The resolution emphasized that the cowardly British colonial authorities were attempting to obstruct the spread of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

	The resolution expressed "strong condemnation of the brutal fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities and full support for the struggle and demands of the heroic Chinese people." The resolution sternly stated: "Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the 'New Territories' are inseparable parts of China, which were forcibly seized by British imperialism hundreds of years ago.

	"The meeting resolutely demands that these Chinese territories be returned to the People's Republic of China and that British imperialism withdraw from these Chinese territories." (Accompanied by photographs)

　　坚决同七亿中国人民站在一起！
　　英国和旅英的亚非拉进步人士集会示威强烈抗议英帝的反华暴行
　　示威者高举毛主席画像，高呼毛主席万岁！中国文化大革命万岁！
    据新华社伦敦四日电  英国和侨居英国的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的几百名进步人士今天举行集会，并在伦敦大街上游行示威，强烈抗议英帝国主义野蛮镇压香港中国居民和殴打中国驻伦敦代办处人员的法西斯暴行。
    示威游行队伍高举着许多幅中国人民和全世界革命人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的巨幅画像，沿途高呼“毛主席万岁！”、“打倒英帝国主义！”、“打倒美帝国主义！”、“打倒苏联修正主义！”、“香港是中国的领土！”、“英国工人谴责英国法西斯警察的暴行！”、“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”等口号。
    当示威队伍到达中国代办处附近时，被包围代办处的大批英国警察挡住。这时，示威群众挥动着《毛主席语录》，齐声高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”、“毛主席万岁！”
    经过斗争，示威群众的代表终于进入了中国代办处，递交了早些时候在群众大会上通过的一项表示最坚决支持中国人民的决议。他们受到了以临时代办沈平为首的中国驻英代办处工作人员的热情接待，并一起朗读毛主席语录和高呼革命口号。
    接着，示威队伍到唐宁街十号，向英国首相递交了他们谴责英帝国主义反华法西斯暴行的决议。
    集会和游行是由“中国之友协会”，“旅英印度工人协会”，和其他组织以及同中国友好的人士组织的。出席集会和参加游行示威的群众，自始至终都表现了他们对中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，表现了英国人民同中国人民之间，以及各国革命人民之间的牢固团结。
    在游行之前举行了群众大会。会议开始时，全体与会者同声朗诵了一段毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    在大会上发言的人一致谴责英帝国主义的反华暴行。他们指出，英帝国主义在香港和伦敦疯狂反华，这是因为他们极端害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。
    大会通过决议，愤怒谴责英国当局派遣法西斯警察殴打中国外交人员的野蛮暴行，并指出，这一暴行已经激起了英国各界进步人士及所有革命人民的愤怒。决议指出：“英帝国主义当局的这种法西斯行径，是变本加厉推行反华运动和为美帝国主义效劳的新罪行，从而对七亿中国人民欠下了新的血债。”
    决议对革命的中国外交官员表示敬意说：“用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国外交官员，对法西斯暴徒展开了针锋相对的斗争。他们伟大的英雄主义和顽强的精神，对于一切革命人民，特别是对于正在同垄断资本及其代言人工党政府的进攻进行斗争的英国工人阶级，是巨大的鼓舞。”决议还表示完全支持中国驻英代办处临时代办沈平就英国警察殴打我外交人员的严重事件向英国政府提出的四项严正要求。
    决议强调指出，吓破了胆的英国殖民当局，妄图阻挠战无不胜的毛泽东思想的传播。
    决议表示“强烈谴责英国殖民当局残酷的法西斯暴行，完全支持英雄的中国人民的斗争和要求”。决议严正指出：“香港、九龙和‘新界’是中国的不可剥夺的部分，这些地方在几百年以前被英帝国主义用暴力强占了。
      “大会坚决要求必须把这些中国领土归还给中华人民共和国，英帝国主义必须从这些中国领土上滚出去。”（附图片）
