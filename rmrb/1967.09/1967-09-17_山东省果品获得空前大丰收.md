Shandong Province has achieved an unprecedented fruit harvest, with the total yield expected to increase by 25 percent compared to last year. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful outcome of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This year, both the "old areas" of Shandong, historically known for their fruit production, and the "new areas" with newly planted fruit trees have seen a bumper harvest. The Linyi and Changwei regions, which traditionally produced few apples, have seen apple yields more than double compared to last year. Famous fruits like the Yantai apples and the yellow pears from Pingyi's Tianbao Mountain have all seen significant increases in production.

    山东省果品获得空前大丰收
    山东省的果品获得空前大丰收，总产量将比去年增长百分之二十五。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    今年，山东历史上盛产果品的“老区”和新栽植果树的“新区”，都获得了丰收。往年很少产苹果的临沂、昌潍两个专区，今年苹果比去年增产一倍多。著名的烟台苹果，平邑天宝山地区的黄梨等，都比去年有大幅度的增产。
