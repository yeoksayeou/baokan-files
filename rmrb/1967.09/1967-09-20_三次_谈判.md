In the midst of the revolutionary criticism and unity, I personally experienced an event that made me deeply realize: only by starting from the desire for unity and seriously conducting self-criticism can we unite with the majority of comrades to fight together and jointly confront the enemy.

Some time ago, our combat team and another organization were engaged in a fierce "internal war," resulting in serious antagonism. Later, with the help of the PLA comrades who were in charge of military training, we began to sit down for "negotiations."

In the first "negotiation," I accused the leader of the other organization of directing their attacks at us. Before I could finish speaking, the other side left. The first "negotiation" failed, and I felt very upset. At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be rich in the spirit of self-criticism, and be brave in correcting the shortcomings and errors in your work." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for me. We are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards, and we listen most to Chairman Mao's words. In handling relations with brother organizations, we should have the courage to be strict with ourselves and lenient with others, and bravely conduct serious self-criticism.

However, recognizing something does not necessarily mean being able to fully achieve it. During the second "negotiation," when it came to my own "critical issues," I thought about the other side's shortcomings and hit the brakes. Seeing that I was just going through the motions, the other side also just paid lip service, and the result was still a failure.

Why did it fail again? I opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and saw that Chairman Mao taught: "Whether or not there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent signs that distinguish us from other political parties." I thought about it and drew two big red circles next to the word "serious." "Serious" means daring to criticize one's own key problems, touching one's soul, and not just going through the motions; "serious" means eliminating selfish thoughts and firmly believing that the masses are reasonable; seriously criticizing one's own shortcomings and errors is a manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the third "negotiation," I first severely touched my own soul, examined my selfish thoughts and factionalism, and sincerely asked the other side to criticize me and help me correct my mistakes. After several exchanges and with the help of the PLA comrades, both sides conducted serious self-criticism, mutually understood each other, and exchanged opinions in good faith. On this new basis, we achieved new unity.

### 三次“谈判”

    三次“谈判”
    在革命的大批判、大联合中，我亲身经历的一件事使我深刻地体会到：只有从团结的愿望出发，认真开展自我批评，才能团结大多数同志一道战斗，共同对敌。
    前些时候，我们战斗队和另一个组织“内战”打得很凶，造成了严重的对立。后来，在主持军训的解放军同志的帮助下，我们开始坐下来“谈判”了。
    第一次“谈判”，我就冲着另一个组织的负责人，责怪他们把矛头指向了我们。我的话没有说完，对方就走了。第一次“谈判”失败，我心里很难过。这时，我记起了毛主席的教导：“富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。”毛主席的话给我指明了前进的方向。我们是毛主席的红小兵，最听毛主席的话，在处理同兄弟组织的关系时，应该有对己严、对人宽的气魄，勇于进行认真的自我批评。
    但是，认识到的东西，还不一定能完全做到。第二次“谈判”时，当谈到自己的“要害”时，一想到对方还有缺点，就又“刹车”了。对方见我走了过场，也就只敷衍了几句，结果还是不欢而散。
    为什么又失败了呢？我翻开了《毛主席语录》，毛主席教导说：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”我想了想，在“认真”二字旁边使劲画上了两个红圈圈。“认真”，就是敢于批评自己的关键问题，触及自己的灵魂，而不能搞形式、走过场；“认真”，就必须排除私心杂念，坚定不移地相信群众是通情达理的；认真地批评自己的缺点错误，就是忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的表现。
    第三次“谈判”，我首先狠触自己的灵魂，检查了自己的私心杂念和山头主义，又诚恳地要求对方批评我，帮助我改正错误。双方经过几次接触，又经过解放军同志的帮助，都认真地做了自我批评，彼此取得了谅解，又善意地互相交换了意见，在新的基础上实现了新的团结。			　四川璧山丁家中学一红卫兵
