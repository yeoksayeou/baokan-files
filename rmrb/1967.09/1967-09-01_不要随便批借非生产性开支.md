Eliminate waste and economize on expenditures; financial supervision must be done well. This requires that all revolutionary masses must guard the financial gate and consciously economize for the revolution. At the same time, we must respect the work of financial personnel and actively assist them in exercising their authority.

However, financial personnel, especially those in charge of approvals, bear direct responsibility for financial supervision. When approving each expenditure, they must keep in mind the interests of the people of the entire nation and the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, adhere to principles, and dare to fight against wasteful practices. They must not shrink from responsibilities by passing the buck to others and playing the role of a "good guy" by standing on the sidelines. We hope that all financial and economic workers will strive to be models of economizing for the revolution and not play the role of a "good guy" who spends the state's money recklessly.

Do Not Arbitrarily Approve Non-Productive Expenditures

I am an accountant. During the great economic wind of this year, our factory, under the instigation of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, spent a large amount of non-productive funds. Recently, in accordance with the principle of economizing for the revolution, with the approval of relevant departments, it was decided to gradually recover the debts. For this, we have been attacked by a part of the people. However, those in charge of approvals have taken an ambiguous attitude, passing the buck to the financial personnel.

Not only that, but some people, disregarding the central government's call to economize for the revolution, continue to approve loans for non-productive expenditures. We financial personnel must guard our posts and strictly implement the state's financial system. At the same time, we hope that those in charge of approving financial expenditures will definitely adhere to principles.

### 不要随便批借非生产性开支

专栏：革命群众来信

    杜绝浪费，节约开支，一定要做好财政监督工作。这就首先要求广大革命群众都来把好财政关，自觉地节约闹革命。同时要尊重财政人员的工作，积极协助他们行使职权。
    但是，财政人员，特别是负责审批的同志，对财政监督负有直接的责任。在审批每笔开支时，都要胸中装着全国人民和无产阶级的革命利益，坚持原则，敢于同浪费现象作斗争；不能遇事退避三舍，把矛盾下放给别人，自己在一边当“好人”。我们希望一切财政经济工作人员，都要争当节约闹革命的模范，不当慷国家之慨的“好人”。

　　不要随便批借非生产性开支
    我是一个会计员。在今年大刮经济主义黑风时，我厂在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的策动下，支出了大批非生产性开支。最近根据节约闹革命的原则，经有关方面的同意，决定酌情逐步收回欠款。为此我们遭到一部分人的围攻。而负责审批的同志却采取了模棱两可的态度，把矛盾下放给财会人员。
    不仅如此，有些人不顾中央提出的节约闹革命的号召，还在不断批借非生产性开支的款项。我们财会人员要坚守自己的岗位，严格执行国家的财政制度，同时希望有关负责审批财政支出的同志，一定要坚持原则。
