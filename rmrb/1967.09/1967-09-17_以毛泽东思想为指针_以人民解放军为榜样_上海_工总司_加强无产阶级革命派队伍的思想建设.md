Editor's Note: The experience of the Shanghai "Workers' General Headquarters" (Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters) in strengthening the ideological construction of the revolutionary masses by taking the People's Liberation Army as an example is very good. We hope that all revolutionary mass organizations will pay attention to this experience and learn from it.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although the work of the proletarian revolutionary masses is complex and varied, at any time we must always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and always emphasize proletarian politics. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve one great victory after another; only in this way can we build the revolutionary masses into a revolutionary army that is highly revolutionary, scientific, and disciplined, extremely proletarianized, and extremely combat-ready.

"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it." This is a very important characteristic and experience of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must, like the PLA, firmly support and strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

At present, every proletarian revolutionary should regard carrying out revolutionary criticism, achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and doing well in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units as the top political task, and strive to put it into practice and achieve the expected results.

According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary from Shanghai on the 16th: The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters (hereinafter referred to as "Workers' Headquarters"), which created heroic deeds in the "January Revolution," enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from the People's Liberation Army nationwide," "trust and rely on the People's Liberation Army," and "support the army and love the people." In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, they took the PLA as an example, with the strong support and enthusiastic help of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, actively carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, and strove to build a revolutionary army of two million soldiers that is highly revolutionary, scientific, disciplined, extremely proletarianized, and extremely combat-ready. The important measures taken by the "Workers' Headquarters" have great significance for achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and provide good experience for the ideological revolutionization of revolutionary masses in other places.

A Major Measure to Achieve a Thorough Victory in the Cultural Revolution

As early as 1929, Chairman Mao pointed out: "There exist various non-proletarian thoughts within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly rectified, the great revolutionary struggle entrusted to the Fourth Red Army by the Chinese revolution will inevitably not be able to be undertaken." Since the "January Revolution," the "Workers' Headquarters" has realized that there are various non-proletarian thoughts within their ranks, hindering the further implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the better completion of the historical tasks given to the Shanghai working class by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the Cultural Revolution enters the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the "Workers' Headquarters" timely proposed to take the People's Liberation Army as an example and, in accordance with the relevant instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the ideological construction of the proletarian revolutionary masses. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, requiring the broad masses of soldiers to be models of supporting and learning from the PLA, and repeatedly requested the leadership of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai to send PLA comrades to help with the work of the "Workers' Headquarters." In late February, the Shanghai Garrison Command sent a small team, mainly consisting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works, to assist the "Workers' Headquarters" in carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and strengthening political and ideological work. Since then, the "Workers' Headquarters" has taken solid steps, with the help of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, to build this army into a revolutionary army that is highly revolutionary, scientific, and disciplined.

Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought is the Fundamental and Great

The invincible People's Liberation Army is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the People's Liberation Army and the fundamental of its construction. The leaders of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai and the leaders of the "Workers' Headquarters" both clearly realized: No matter how much support, the greatest support for the revolutionary masses is to support them with Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how important, the most important thing for the revolutionary masses is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and learn from the PLA's experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The "Workers' Headquarters" took the PLA as an example, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the most important position, requiring Mao Zedong Thought to be the unified guiding ideology, and using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the two million soldiers, especially the leading cadres of the "Workers' Headquarters."

The proletarian revolutionary masses in Shanghai deeply love Chairman Mao and have an extremely profound class sentiment towards Chairman Mao's works. When they rose up in rebellion against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, they eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works, drawing immense fighting strength from Mao Zedong Thought. After seizing power in the "January Revolution," their status changed, their power increased, their tasks multiplied, and their burdens grew heavier. Many leading cadres were eager to do a good job but lacked experience, sitting down all day, buried in affairs, and neglecting the study of Chairman Mao's works. The PLA small team felt this was a serious problem. With their active supervision and enthusiastic assistance, the standing committee and committee members of the "Workers' Headquarters" began to establish a system for studying Chairman Mao's works. At the beginning, the study often suffered from the impact of busy specific affairs, and the study system could not be guaranteed.

Can the study be sustained? The key is whether the study of Chairman Mao's works can be closely combined with the current actual struggle. Under the help and influence of the leaders of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai and the PLA small team, the standing committee and committee members of the "Workers' Headquarters" studied Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to "study with problems, study actively and apply, study and use in combination, study urgently what is needed immediately, and achieve immediate results by focusing on the 'use' aspect," and invited the Shanghai Garrison's model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences. The comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" also held study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works with the PLA soldiers and officers several times. Everyone deeply felt: Only by taking Chairman Mao's works as weapons, food, and steering wheel, like the PLA, and frequently and consciously using the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the targets of actual struggles, can one truly grasp the fundamental of strengthening the ideological construction of the proletarian revolutionary ranks. The busier the work, the more contradictions, the more one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Only by earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works, seriously grasping Mao Zedong Thought, and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's instructions, can one raise ideological awareness, grasp the main contradictions, correctly solve problems, and overcome blind busyness. Otherwise, even if one makes mistakes, one will not know how they were made. Therefore, everyone made a firm decision to strictly implement the study system and do their utmost to master Mao Zedong Thought. Starting from late May, the standing committee, committee members, and headquarters staff of the "Workers' Headquarters," except in extremely special circumstances, insisted on half a day of concentrated study every day. Due to serious study and deep understanding, they understood and acted, thus achieving remarkable results.

Under the leadership of the municipal revolutionary committee and the assistance of PLA comrades, in June, the "Workers' Headquarters" drew on the good experiences of the grassroots and decided to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing the backbone of the workers' revolutionary masses (including the responsible persons of the liaison stations and command posts of various districts and systems and some grassroots organizations) to participate, study Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and further implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Two sessions of the Mao Zedong Thought study class have been held. Under the leadership of the headquarters, many districts, systems, and grassroots factories' revolutionary mass organizations affiliated with the "Workers' Headquarters" also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the help of the PLA, greatly promoting the widespread and in-depth development of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Now, in the ranks of the "Workers' Headquarters," the atmosphere of "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao" has initially formed, and Mao Zedong Thought has begun to establish absolute authority in thought and action.

Emphasizing Politics and Firmly Grasping the Direction of the Struggle

The "Workers' Headquarters" regards emphasizing proletarian politics and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle as the central link in strengthening the ideological construction of the proletarian revolutionary masses at present. For this purpose, they organized the soldiers of the "Workers' Headquarters" to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas." The responsible persons of the "Workers' Headquarters" increasingly clearly realized through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works: The ranks of the "Workers' Headquarters" are revolutionary ranks under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. The main object of the revolution is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The proletarian revolutionary masses must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and strictly act according to the theory, line, policy, and methods formulated by Chairman Mao for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At present, the revolutionary criticism is being further deepened, the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit are increasingly closely combined, the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" are further developing and consolidating, and the policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" is being earnestly implemented. The "Workers' Headquarters" should firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Under the help of the PLA, the comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" seriously examined the erroneous tendencies in their ranks of subjective analysis of the political situation and subjective guidance of work. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, striving to "analyze the political situation and estimate the class forces with the method of Marxism-Leninism," and paying attention to investigation and study, "thereby deciding the strategy of struggle and the methods of work," to prevent "falling into the pit of fantasy and adventurism." They firmly implemented a principle: Whatever is in line with the direction of the struggle should be done thoroughly; whatever is against the direction of the struggle should be firmly not done.

Some comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" used to handle problems without first looking at the direction, nor patiently doing detailed political and ideological work, but dealt with things superficially, expressed opinions lightly, and even supported one side and suppressed the other, affecting revolutionary unity and hindering revolutionary criticism. After learning, they changed this approach and handled problems by emphasizing politics. Once, two comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" went to a factory to handle a dispute between two factions. As soon as they entered the factory, both factions tried to pull them into their offices. When they held a meeting with both factions' representatives in the canteen, both sides insisted on their own views, and the atmosphere was quite tense. They did not handle specific problems first but studied Chairman Mao's quotations and relevant documents with both factions' representatives, and then shared their thoughts on the current situation and tasks, and represented the headquarters to conduct self-criticism. Their approach educated both factions' representatives, who immediately conducted self-criticism on the spot and expressed their willingness to stop the "internal war." Soon, after discussion and consultation, the two factions of the revolutionary mass organization in the factory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the help of the "Workers' Headquarters," jointly established a revolutionary criticism liaison station, promoting revolutionary unity and carrying out revolutionary criticism.

Some comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" used to lack class analysis in dealing with cadres and could not well implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. Under the help of the PLA, these comrades, through learning and practice, understood that revolutionary cadres are precious wealth of the proletarian revolutionary cause and should believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. They quickly changed their views, daring to support and protect cadres who rose up in revolution, and daring to absorb revolutionary cadres into various levels of leadership positions. Hearing that the grassroots revolutionary mass organizations absorbed cadres to participate, they not only thought they did the right thing but also helped them do the work better. Many factories' revolutionary mass organizations, with the support and help of the "Workers' Headquarters," did a lot of work on cadres, accelerating the process of realizing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and establishing temporary power organs.

Breaking Private Interests and Achieving Ideological Revolutionization

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Party, our ranks, although the majority is pure, in order to lead the revolutionary movement to develop better and faster, to complete it, we must seriously rectify it in terms of ideology and organization. And in order to rectify it in terms of organization, we must first rectify it in terms of ideology, and carry out a struggle of proletarian ideology against non-proletarian ideology." While carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the "Workers' Headquarters" implemented an open rectification.

The "Workers' Headquarters" had rectified several times. Due to not seriously studying Chairman Mao's works and not emphasizing politics enough, those rectifications only laid out the problems but did not truly solve them. This time, with the specific help of PLA comrades, the "Workers' Headquarters" decided to rectify while learning, fighting, and rectifying, making the rectification movement truly a "universal Marxist educational movement" to achieve the goals of rectifying ideology, style, and organization. To widely listen to opinions from all sides, the "Workers' Headquarters" also requested the municipal revolutionary committee to help invite representatives from some brother organizations that have the same or similar views with the "Workers' Headquarters," especially inviting those who had different views from the "Workers' Headquarters" and even opposed the "Workers' Headquarters" and had been proven wrong by practice to participate in the rectification meeting, sincerely welcoming them to raise sharp criticisms. The comrades of the "Workers' Headquarters" also seized the opportunity to rectify and summarized and organized the criticisms raised by all sides in the rectification meeting, distributing them to the relevant comrades as a mirror to constantly examine and check their thoughts and actions.

The responsible persons of the Shanghai "Workers' Headquarters" said that their ranks are still far from the standard of the People's Liberation Army, and now they have only taken the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles. They believe that the sharp and complex class struggle will inevitably continue to reflect in the ranks of the "Workers' Headquarters"; bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts will always infiltrate their ranks. They must make a firm decision to always follow the great leader Chairman Mao, always believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, strive to achieve what Vice Chairman Lin requires, to raise the political awareness of the proletariat high, to make the atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought thick, to boost morale, to strengthen unity, to deepen hatred towards the enemy, and truly build the ranks of two million people into a revolutionary army that is highly revolutionary, scientific, disciplined, extremely proletarianized, and extremely combat-ready, like the People's Liberation Army, and play the role that the proletarian revolutionary masses should play in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    以毛泽东思想为指针　以人民解放军为榜样
    上海“工总司”加强无产阶级革命派队伍的思想建设
    编者按：上海“工总司”以人民解放军为榜样，加强无产阶级革命派队伍的思想建设的经验很好。我们希望各个革命群众组织重视这个经验，学习这个经验。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派，要做的工作，尽管千头万绪，但是，任何时候都要念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治。只有这样，才能牢牢掌握斗争大方向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取一个又一个伟大胜利；才能把革命群众队伍建设成一支具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军。
    “毛主席怎么说，就怎么做”。这是人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的一个极其重要的特点和经验。我们一定要象解放军那样，对毛主席的指示，坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    当前，每个无产阶级革命派，就应当把开展革命的大批判，实现革命的大联合和三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，作为头等政治任务，并且努力付诸实践，达到预期的效果。
    据新华社上海十六日电　本社记者述评：在“一月革命”中创造了英雄业绩的上海工人革命造反总司令部（简称“工总司”），热烈响应毛主席发出的“全国学人民解放军”、“相信和依靠人民解放军”和“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决按照毛主席的指示，以解放军为榜样，在中国人民解放军驻沪部队的有力支持和热情帮助下，积极开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，坚持突出无产阶级政治，努力把拥有二百万战士的革命群众队伍，建设成为一支具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性和非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军。“工总司”采取的这一重要措施，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利具有重大的意义，为各地无产阶级革命派的思想革命化提供了好经验。
    夺取文化大革命彻底胜利的重大措施
    毛主席早在一九二九年就曾指出：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”上海“工总司”从“一月革命”以来，意识到自己队伍里存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，妨碍进一步贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，妨碍更好地完成无产阶级文化大革命给予上海工人阶级的历史任务。随着文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，“工总司”及时明确提出要以人民解放军为榜样，按照毛主席和林副主席的有关指示，加强无产阶级革命派队伍的思想建设。他们遵循毛主席的教导，要求广大战士做拥护解放军、学习解放军的模范，并多次向驻沪部队领导机关提出请解放军同志进入“工总司”帮助工作的要求。二月下旬，上海警备区党委派出了以学习毛主席著作积极分子为主体的一支小分队，协助“工总司”开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，加强政治思想工作。从此，“工总司”就在人民解放军驻沪部队的帮助下，为把这支队伍建设成为具有高度革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的革命大军，迈出了坚实的步伐。
    活学活用毛泽东思想是根本的根本伟大的中国人民解放军是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是中国人民解放军的灵魂，是解放军建设的根本。驻沪部队负责人和“工总司”负责人都明确认识到：千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想支持革命派，是解放军最大的“爱民”，是对无产阶级革命派最大的支援；千重要，万重要，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，是革命派最大的“拥军”，是向人民解放军最重要的学习。“工总司”以解放军为榜样，把活学活用毛主席著作放在头等重要的地位，要求以毛泽东思想作为统一的指导思想，用毛泽东思想把二百万战士、首先把“工总司”的领导骨干武装起来。
    上海无产阶级革命派衷心热爱毛主席，对毛主席著作有着无比深厚的阶级感情。他们在奋起向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派造反的时候，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，从毛泽东思想中汲取了巨大的战斗力量。“一月革命”夺权以后，他们地位变了，权力大了，任务多了，担子重了，许多领导骨干急于搞好工作，但又缺乏经验，整天坐不下来，陷在事务堆里，放松了毛主席著作的学习。解放军小分队感到这是一个严重的问题。在他们的积极督促和热情协助下，“工总司”的常委和委员开始建立了学习毛主席著作的制度。开始一段时间，学习往往受到繁忙的具体事务的冲击，学习制度无法得到保证。
    能不能把学习坚持下去，关键在于能不能把学习毛主席著作同当前实际斗争紧密结合起来。“工总司”的常委和委员在驻沪部队负责人和解放军小分队的帮助和影响下，学习了林副主席“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示，并请上海警备区活学活用毛主席著作标兵介绍经验，“工总司”的同志还和解放军指战员一起，多次举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。大家深切地感受到：只有象解放军那样把毛主席著作当成武器、粮食和方向盘，经常地自觉地以毛泽东思想之矢，射实际斗争之的，才是真正抓住了加强无产阶级革命队伍思想建设的根本。工作越忙，矛盾越多，就越要活学活用毛主席著作。只有努力学习毛主席著作，认真掌握毛泽东思想，深刻领会毛主席的指示，才能提高思想觉悟，抓住主要矛盾，正确解决问题，克服盲目忙乱。不然的话，连犯了错误也会不知道是怎么犯的。因此，大家下定决心，坚决执行学习制度，尽最大努力把毛泽东思想学到手。从五月下旬开始，“工总司”的常委、委员和总部工作人员，除极为特殊的情况以外，坚持每天半天集中学习。由于认真学习，深刻领会，懂了就干，因而收到了显著的效果。
    在市革命委员会的领导和解放军同志的协助下，六月份，“工总司”吸取基层的好经验，决定举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织工人革命派的骨干（包括所属各区、各系统联络站、指挥部的负责人和部分基层组织负责人）参加，学习毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步贯彻毛主席的革命路线。毛泽东思想学习班已经举办两期。在总部的带动下，“工总司”所属的不少区、系统和基层工厂的革命群众组织，也都在解放军的帮助下，先后分别举办了毛泽东思想学习班，大大推动了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动广泛深入的发展。现在，在“工总司”的队伍里，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，初步蔚成风气，在思想上和行动上，开始树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    突出政治，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向
    上海“工总司”把突出无产阶级政治，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，作为当前加强无产阶级革命派队伍思想建设的中心环节。为此，他们组织“工总司”战士活学活用毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作。“工总司”的负责人通过活学活用毛主席著作，越来越明确认识到：“工总司”的队伍是在无产阶级专政条件下干革命的队伍。革命的主要对象，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。无产阶级革命派必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地按照毛主席制定的关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和方法办事。当前，革命的大批判正在进一步深入展开，大批判和各单位的斗批改日益紧密结合起来，革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”正在进一步发展和巩固，“抓革命，促生产”的方针在认真地贯彻执行。“工总司”应当牢牢把握斗争的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “工总司”的同志在解放军的帮助下，认真检查了自己队伍中存在着的对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导的错误倾向。他们遵循毛主席的教导，努力“用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量”，并且注意调查研究，“由此来决定斗争的策略和工作的方法”，防止“堕入空想和盲动的深坑”。他们坚定不移地实行一条原则：凡是符合斗争大方向的事，大做特做；凡是违背斗争大方向的事，坚决不干。
    “工总司”的少数同志，过去处理问题，往往是不先看大方向，又不耐心做细致的政治思想工作，而是就事论事，轻率表态，甚至支持一方，压制另一方，影响革命的大联合，妨碍革命的大批判。以后，经过学习，他们改变了这种做法，处理问题重视突出政治。有一次，“工总司”的两个同志到一个工厂处理两派纠纷。人一进厂，两派都把他们往自己的办公室里拉。他们同双方代表在食堂开会时，双方又各执一词，气氛相当紧张。他们就先不处理具体问题，而是同双方代表一道学习毛主席语录和有关文件，又结合当前形势和任务谈了自己的体会，并代表总部进行自我批评。他们这样做，使双方代表很受教育，当场都做了自我批评，表示要停止“内战”。不久，经过讨论和协商，这个厂革命群众组织的两派就在毛泽东思想的指引下，在“工总司”的帮助下，共同建立了大批判联络站，促进了革命的大联合，开展了革命的大批判。
    “工总司”的少数同志，过去对待干部缺乏阶级分析，不能很好地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。在解放军的帮助下，这些同志通过学习和实践，懂得了革命干部是无产阶级革命事业的宝贵财富，应当相信和依靠干部的大多数。他们很快就改变了自己的看法，对起来革命的干部敢于支持和保护，对革命的干部敢于吸收到各级领导岗位。听到基层革命群众组织吸收干部参加，不但觉得他们做得对，而且帮助他们把工作做得更好。不少工厂的革命群众组织在“工总司”的支持帮助下，对干部做了大量的工作，加快了实现革命的“三结合”、建立临时权力机构的进程。
        破私立公，实现思想革命化
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的党，我们的队伍，虽然其中的大部分是纯洁的，但是为要领导革命运动更好地发展，更快地完成，就必须从思想上组织上认真地整顿一番。而为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”“工总司”在开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的同时，实行了开门整风。
    “工总司”曾经几次整风。由于没有认真地学习毛主席著作，突出政治不够，因而那几次整风都只是把问题摊开来，并没有真正得到解决。这一次，在解放军同志的具体帮助下，“工总司”决定边学习，边战斗，边整风，使整风运动真正成为一个“普遍的马克思主义的教育运动”，达到整顿思想，整顿作风，整顿组织的目的。为了广泛听取各方面的意见，“工总司”还请市革命委员会帮助邀请了一些同“工总司”观点相同和接近的兄弟组织的代表，特别邀请了同“工总司”观点不同的、甚至反对过“工总司”并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人参加整风会议，诚恳地欢迎他们提出尖锐的批评。“工总司”的同志还抓紧整改，并把各方面在整风会上提出的批评意见，归纳整理，印发给有关同志，作为一面镜子，随时对照和检点自己的思想行动。
    上海“工总司”的负责人说，我们这支队伍距离人民解放军的标准还很远，现在只是万里长征迈出了第一步。他们认为：尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，一定还会不断地反映到“工总司”的队伍中来；资产阶级和小资产阶级思想随时都会侵蚀我们的队伍。一定要下定决心，永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，永远相信和依靠人民解放军，努力做到林彪副主席所要求的，把无产阶级的政治觉悟提得高高的，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把士气鼓得足足的，把团结搞得好好的，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，真正把二百万人的队伍，建设成一支象人民解放军一样具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性和非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中发挥无产阶级革命派应有的作用。
