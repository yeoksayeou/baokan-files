The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, is surging forward with an irresistible momentum, like a mighty wave. The bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev has collapsed and is facing imminent doom. The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has entered the decisive phase. At this critical moment, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" has been published. This is a heavy artillery shell aimed at the bourgeois headquarters. It accurately hits the vital points of the bourgeois headquarters. It embodies Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, pointing out the battlefield and the target of the struggle for the billion-strong cultural revolution army, guiding the cultural revolution army to throw itself into this decisive battle with all its might.

Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment scientifically reflects the objective laws of class struggle, represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, and is the beacon illuminating the victorious advance of our revolutionary cause. It is the fundamental guarantee for defeating the enemy and achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must absolutely use Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to unify our thoughts and actions, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to advance courageously.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggles." Now, a handful of counter-revolutionaries, using ultra-leftist slogans in appearance but ultra-rightist in essence, are spreading the evil wind of "doubt everything," directing their spears at the proletarian headquarters and at the pillar of proletarian dictatorship—the great People's Liberation Army. The notorious "May 16 Corps" is such a counter-revolutionary organization.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the General Staff Department Political Department resolutely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously studies Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article, and with the most resolute, most active, swiftest, and bravest fighting posture, launches a fierce counterattack against this handful of counter-revolutionaries, thoroughly exposing their conspiracies. In the high tide of revolutionary criticism, we launch the most fierce attacks on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We vow to defend our great leader Chairman Mao, to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and to defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must act swiftly, be highly vigilant, and timely detect the enemy's conspiracies to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, whether they come from the ultra-left or the right, and give them resolute blows and suppression. Wherever the enemy's hand reaches, we will cut it off there.

　　誓死保卫毛主席的伟大战略部署
　　中国人民解放军总参谋部政治部无产阶级革命派
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导之下，正以排山倒海之势，波涛汹涌，滚滚向前。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，已土崩瓦解，面临着灭顶之灾。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争已进入决战阶段。在这个关键时刻，姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》一文发表了。这是投向资产阶级司令部的重型炮弹。它准确地击中了资产阶级司令部的要害。它体现了伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，向亿万文化革命大军指明了战斗的目标和战场的中心，引导文化革命大军全力投入这场决战。
    毛主席的伟大战略部署，科学地反映了阶级斗争的客观规律，代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，它是照耀我们革命事业胜利前进的灯塔，它是战胜敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的根本保证。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，革命就胜利，就前进；稍微背离了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和伟大战略部署，就会使革命遭到挫折和失败。我们要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就一定要用毛主席的伟大战略部署来统一思想，统一行动，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”现在有一小撮反革命分子用貌似极“左”而实质极右的口号，刮起“怀疑一切”的妖风，把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，指向无产阶级专政的坚强柱石——伟大的中国人民解放军。臭名昭著的“五·一六兵团”，就是这样的反革命组织。
    我们总参谋部政治部无产阶级革命派，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习姚文元同志的重要文章，以最坚决、最积极、最迅速、最勇敢的战斗姿态，迎头痛击这一小撮反革命分子的挑战，彻底揭露他们的阴谋。在革命大批判的高潮中，向着党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开最猛烈的进攻。誓死保卫伟大领袖毛主席，誓死捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级司令部，誓死保卫毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们要紧急行动起来，高度警惕并及时察觉阶级敌人破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的阴谋，不管它从极“左”的方面来，还是从右的方面来，都要给予坚决的打击和镇压，敌人的黑手伸向那里，就把它斩断在那里。
