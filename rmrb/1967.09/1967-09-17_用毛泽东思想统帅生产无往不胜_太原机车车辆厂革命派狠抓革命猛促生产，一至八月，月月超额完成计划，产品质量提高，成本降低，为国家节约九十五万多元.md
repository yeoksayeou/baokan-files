The revolutionary cadres of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have been vigorously promoting the revolution and production. From January to August, they have exceeded the production plan every month, improved product quality, reduced costs, and saved the state over 950,000 yuan.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 16th: After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant united with the broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres to promote the revolution and production. From January to August this year, they have exceeded the state plan every month, significantly improved product quality, greatly reduced costs, and saved the state over 950,000 yuan.

On January 18th, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this plant seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The next day, conservative forces, using the difficulties caused by the capitalist-roaders' sabotage of production, put pressure on the revolutionary cadres, shouting, "No coal, no iron, no people!" They created all sorts of obstacles. Facing Chairman Mao's portrait, the revolutionary cadres solemnly swore: They would definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to vigorously promote the revolution and production. They issued three "Open Letters to All Workers of the Plant," exposing and criticizing the capitalist-roaders' evil plots to sabotage production, and vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp the revolution and promote production." They also convened plant-wide and workshop-level meetings to promote revolution and production, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all revolutionary workers in the plant. When coal was scarce, they saved heating coal for production; when iron was scarce, they used their spare time to collect scrap iron; when labor was insufficient, base-level cadres went to the front lines to work, and revolutionary youngsters from the affiliated middle school also came to support. As a result, they excellently completed the production plan for January, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary cadres and striking a heavy blow to the capitalist-roaders.

Under the help of the stationed PLA, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant have always insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide and direct production. They thoroughly changed the past practice of the capitalist-roaders within the party, who only issued production targets, only reported figures, and only talked about production in meetings. When arranging, inspecting, reporting, and summarizing work, they first arranged, inspected, reported, and summarized the study of Chairman Mao's works. They also established the "Daily Reading" system, studying Chairman Mao's works for one hour each day, and frequently holding "Study and Application" meetings. This practice promoted the self-awareness of revolutionary workers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, accelerating the revolutionization of people's thinking.

According to Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. We must also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice," the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this plant corrected their attitude towards the masses and actively united with the broad masses of workers to vigorously promote the revolution and production.

    用毛泽东思想统帅生产无往不胜
    太原机车车辆厂革命派狠抓革命猛促生产，一至八月，月月超额完成计划，产品质量提高，成本降低，为国家节约九十五万多元
    据新华社太原十六日电太原机车车辆厂的无产阶级革命派夺权后，团结广大革命群众和干部，抓革命，促生产，今年一至八月，月月超额完成国家计划，产品质量显著提高，成本大大降低，为国家节约九十五万多元。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派在一月十八日夺了工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。夺权的第二天，保守势力就利用党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏生产所造成的困难，对革命派施加压力，大喊大叫：“没有煤了，没有铁了，没有人了！”百般刁难。无产阶级革命派对着毛主席像，庄严宣誓：一定要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们连续三次发出《告全厂职工书》，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏生产的罪恶阴谋，大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，同时分别召开全厂和各车间的抓革命促生产誓师大会，进行大动员，调动全厂革命职工的积极性。缺少煤，他们节省烤火煤，用于生产；缺少铁，他们利用业余时间拣废铁；人力不足，基层干部到第一线参加劳动，子弟中学的革命小将也来支援。结果，出色地完成了一月份的生产计划，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风。
    太原机车车辆厂无产阶级革命派在驻厂解放军的帮助下，一直坚持用毛泽东思想统帅生产，指挥生产。他们彻底改变过去厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派下达任务，只下达指标；汇报情况，只报数字；开会只讲生产的修正主义作法。在布置、检查、汇报、总结工作时，首先布置、检查、汇报、总结学习毛主席著作的安排、情况、收获和经验。他们还建立了“天天读”的制度，每天学习一小时毛主席著作，并经常召开“讲用会”。这样做，促进了广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性，加速了人的思想革命化。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派根据毛主席“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的教导，端正了对待群众的态度，主动团结广大职工一同狠抓革命，猛促生产。
