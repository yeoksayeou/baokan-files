Huong Van Dan, the leader of the delegation, spoke at the welcome banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai. He declared that the people of South Vietnam are determined to hold their guns firmly and persist in the war of resistance against America until they achieve complete victory. The imperialist schemes of the United States will never subdue the people of South Vietnam. The people of Vietnam and China will forever stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting and winning together.

	Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, respected Vice Premier Li Fuchun, respected Comrade Kang Sheng, respected Deputy Premier Le Quoc Vui, the head of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's party and government delegation, respected ambassadors, charge d'affaires, and their spouses, dear friends:

	At a time when the people and soldiers of South Vietnam are launching a vigorous campaign to kill the enemy and achieve merit, celebrating the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, we, at the invitation of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, have the great honor of being sent by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to participate in the glorious National Day celebrations of the People's Republic of China and to visit China for friendly exchanges. We bring the deep camaraderie and gratitude of the people and armed forces of South Vietnam to the people and the People's Liberation Army of China. Especially, allow us to convey the warmest greetings and respect from Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, the leaders of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam, and the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, Premier Zhou, the leaders of the Chinese party and state, and the fraternal people and People's Liberation Army of China. We also take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to the Chinese leaders and people for their warm reception of our delegation.

	Friends,

	The people and soldiers of South Vietnam, who are fighting against American imperialism with weapons in hand, together with the seven hundred million fraternal people of China, joyfully celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The victory of China and the birth of New China came after decades of fierce struggle against the Kuomintang clique, which collaborated with Japanese fascism and American imperialism. This was a thunderous spring thunder that shook Asia. From then on, the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa took China's revolution as an example, stood up one after another, smashed the shackles of imperialism, and struggled for national independence, democracy, and peace.

	For eighteen years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, striven for self-improvement, worked hard, and engaged in creative labor to build a new China with modern industry, agriculture, and national defense, and advanced science. Recently, the successful test of the hydrogen bomb marks the tremendous progress made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao. The people and soldiers of South Vietnam are extremely delighted and inspired by the brilliant achievements of the fraternal Chinese people in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. We are fully convinced that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve even greater victories in their revolutionary struggle and in the cause of building their country.

	Friends,

	The people and soldiers of South Vietnam will never forget the full support and tremendous assistance provided by the Chinese Communist Party, government, and people in our struggle against American imperialism. The Chinese people are not only reliable neighbors and close brothers of the Vietnamese people but also comrades-in-arms in the same trench. Our shared fate of life and death binds our two nations closely together. Facing the common enemy—the warlike American invaders, the people of Vietnam and China will forever stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting and winning together. In the current war of resistance against American imperialism, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam have consistently received tremendous and effective assistance from the fraternal Chinese people. The people and soldiers of South Vietnam will forever cherish Chairman Mao's statement on August 29, 1963: "We Chinese people are firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. I am deeply convinced that the people of South Vietnam will be able to achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful reunification of the motherland." The Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's instructions, regard their own territory as a vast rear base for the Vietnamese people and spare no effort to assist the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism. The people and soldiers of South Vietnam highly value the heartfelt support of the fraternal Chinese people and regard it as a powerful encouragement and significant contribution to the sacred cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation. On behalf of all the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, we once again express our deep gratitude to the respected Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the fraternal Chinese people.

	Friends,

	Although American imperialism has suffered heavy defeats in South Vietnam, they stubbornly continue to intensify and expand their war of aggression in South Vietnam and escalate the war in North Vietnam. They have increased the number of American troops in South Vietnam to four hundred and ninety thousand and use various modern weapons, such as B-52 strategic bombers, rapid-fire cannons, poison gas bombs, and more, to continuously carry out sweeps and massacres of the people of South Vietnam. While continuing to commit heinous crimes in South Vietnam, they are also shouting "peace talks," attempting to achieve their evil intentions through the United Nations. However, the imperialist schemes of the United States will never subdue the people of South Vietnam. The people and soldiers of South Vietnam firmly declare: The United Nations has no right to interfere in Vietnamese affairs. In the face of the United States intensifying and expanding the war, we, the people of South Vietnam, will continue to resolutely and vigorously advance the war of resistance against American imperialism. The political program issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on September 1, 1967, clearly reflects the high determination of the people of South Vietnam: No matter what sacrifices and hardships, no matter how many years of fighting, the people of South Vietnam will resolutely hold their guns and press forward to victory, resolutely and thoroughly defeat the American invaders, and resolutely achieve the basic goals proposed in the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, namely independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, prosperity, and ultimately the reunification of the motherland.

	On this occasion, we extend our greetings to the party and government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as fellow countrymen from the north and south. Please convey our deep conviction, boundless longing, and determination to defeat the American aggressors to Chairman Huu and the dear seventeen million people of the north.

	With the support of the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the progressive people of the world, and with the close cooperation of the fraternal people of the north, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with the tight unity of the entire nation, and with the powerful armed forces that have won every battle, we will surely win. The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will surely be fully realized, and glorious victory will surely belong to the people of South Vietnam.

	We wish the fraternal Chinese people great achievements in their revolutionary struggle and in the cause of building their country.

	On this joyous and inspiring day of celebrating the glorious National Day of the Chinese people and filled with camaraderie and fighting spirit, we propose a toast:

	To the brilliant victories of the Chinese people,
	To the ever-greater victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism,
	To the eternal solidarity between Vietnam and China,
	To the good health of the respected Chairman Mao,
	To the good health of the respected Chairman Huu,
	To the good health of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho,
	To the good health of Premier Zhou Enlai,
	To the good health of Deputy Premier Le Quoc Vui,
	To the good health of the ambassadors, charge d'affaires, and their spouses,
	To the good health of all the guests and friends present today.

	Cheers!

　　美帝国主义的一切阴谋手段丝毫不能压服越南南方人民，越、中两国人民将永远肩并肩地战斗在一起，胜利在一起敬爱的周恩来总理，敬爱的李富春副总理，敬爱的康生同志，敬爱的越南民主共和国党政代表团团长黎清毅副总理，敬爱的各国大使、代办和夫人，亲爱的朋友们：
    正当越南南方军民发动了轰轰烈烈的杀敌立功竞赛运动以祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的时候，我们应中国政府和中国共产党的邀请，十分光荣地受越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的派遣，前来参加中华人民共和国光辉的国庆节并在中国进行友好访问。我们代表团从抗美救国的枪炮轰鸣的越南南方，来到了英雄的中国，给中国人民和中国人民解放军带来了越南南方人民和越南南方解放武装力量深厚的团结战斗友情和最深切的谢意。特别是请允许我们向毛主席、林副主席、周总理、中国党和国家领导人、兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军转达阮友寿主席、越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会领导人，越南南方人民和南方解放武装力量的热烈祝贺和敬意。也请允许我们在这里对中国的领导人和中国人民给予我们代表团的亲切接待表示真诚的感谢。
    诸位，诸位朋友，
    手拿武器正在抗击美帝国主义的越南南方全体军民，同兄弟的七亿中国人民一起，欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国国庆。中国的胜利和新中国的诞生，经过了几十年反对同日本法西斯和美国帝国主义相勾结的蒋介石军阀集团的激烈斗争，这是震撼亚洲的春雷。从此以后，亚洲、非洲的革命人民以中国人民的革命为榜样，站了起来，接二连三地砸碎了帝国主义的镣铐，争取民族独立、民主和和平。
    十八年来，在毛主席的领导下，中国人民发扬了不断革命的精神，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，进行了创造性的辛勤劳动，建设着一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代国防，具有先进科学的强大的新中国。最近，中国氢弹试验成功，这标志着中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，所取得的飞跃进步。越南南方全体军民对兄弟的中国人民在政治、军事、经济、文化方面取得的辉煌成就，感到极为欢欣鼓舞，并且完全相信，中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，将在革命斗争和建设祖国的事业中取得更加巨大的成就。
    诸位，诸位朋友，
    越南南方军民永远不会忘记中国共产党、中国政府和人民对我们的抗美救国斗争的全力支持和巨大援助。中国人民不但是越南人民的可靠邻邦，亲密兄弟，而且是同一战壕里的战友。我们两国同生死共患难的命运把我们两个民族紧紧地连系在一起。面对着共同的敌人——好战的美国侵略者，越、中两国人民将永远肩并肩地战斗在一起，胜利在一起。越南南方人民在目前的抗美救国战争中，一贯得到兄弟的中国人民的巨大、有效的援助。越南南方军民永远牢记毛主席一九六三年八月二十九日的声明：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。我深信，越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献。”中国人民遵照毛主席的指示，把自己的国土看做是越南人民的巨大后方，并不惜做出一切努力援助越南人民的抗美救国斗争。越南南方军民高度地估价兄弟的中国人民尽心竭力的支持，并把它看做是对越南人民神圣的救国事业的有力鼓舞和重大贡献。我们谨再一次代表越南南方的全体军民，向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民表示深切的感谢。
    诸位、诸位朋友，
    当前，美帝国主义虽然在越南南方遭到沉重的失败，但他们仍顽固地在越南南方强化和扩大侵略战争，同时在越南北方加紧战争升级。他们把侵入越南南方的美军增加到四十九万人，并使用多种现代化的杀人武器，如Ｂ52战略轰炸机、快速火炮、毒气弹等等，不停地进行扫荡，残杀越南南方人民。他们继续在越南南方犯下滔天罪行的同时，又在叫喊“和平协商”，妄想通过联合国实现他们的罪恶意图。然而，美帝国主义的一切阴谋手段丝毫不能压服越南南方人民，越南南方军民肯定地说：联合国无权干涉越南问题。在美帝国主义强化和扩大战争的情况下，我们越南南方人民将继续坚决大力推动抗美救国的战争。越南南方民族解放阵线一九六七年九月一日发表的政治纲领，已明确体现了越南南方人民的高度决心：这就是不管任何牺牲和艰苦，不管需要战斗多少年，越南南方人民将坚决紧握手中枪，乘胜前进，坚决彻底打败美国侵略者，坚决实现越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领中所提出的基本目标，即独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣，进而实现祖国的统一。
    趁此机会，我们谨向越南民主共和国的党、政府代表团致以南北骨肉同胞的敬礼，请你们向敬爱的胡主席和亲爱的一千七百万北方同胞转达阮友寿主席，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和一千四百万南方同胞的深刻信念、无限怀念和战胜美国侵略强盗的决心。
    越南南方人民得到中国人民、社会主义各国人民和世界进步人民的支持，同骨肉般的北方人民同心协力，并有着越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导，有着全国人民紧密的团结，有着百战百胜的强大武装力量，我们就一定胜利，越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领就一定能够完满实现，辉煌的胜利一定属于越南南方人民。
    敬祝兄弟的中国人民在革命斗争和祖国的建设事业中取得许多伟大的成就。
    在这兴高采烈、欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中国人民光荣的国庆节和洋溢着团结战斗友谊的今天，我们建议诸位、诸位朋友举杯：
    祝贺中国人民的辉煌胜利，
    祝贺越南人民在抗美救国事业中取得日益巨大的胜利，
    祝越中两国的战斗团结万古长青，
    祝敬爱的毛主席身体健康，
    祝敬爱的胡主席身体健康，
    祝阮友寿主席身体健康，
    祝周恩来总理身体健康，
    祝黎清毅副总理身体健康，
    祝外交使团各位大使、代办和夫人身体健康，
    祝今天在座的各位和朋友们的身体健康
    干杯！
