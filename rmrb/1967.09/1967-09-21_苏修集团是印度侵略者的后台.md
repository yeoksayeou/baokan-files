On September 11th to 13th, the Indian reactionaries launched a serious military provocation against China along the Sino-Indian border. On the 14th, Indian Defense Minister Singh went to Moscow to report to his masters and seek rewards. There, Singh reported on the "situation on the Sino-Indian border" and received substantial rewards from his masters. This fact further exposed the Soviet revisionists as the backers behind the Indian reactionaries' military provocations against China.

Before the Indian military attacked China, the Soviet revisionists had already started their propaganda machine, spreading lies and claiming that China was strengthening its military along the Tibetan border, creating public opinion for India's armed provocations. As soon as the Indian invading forces opened fire on the Chinese border troops, the Soviet revisionists eagerly jumped out, distorting facts and falsely accusing China of firing the first shot, attempting to shift the blame onto the Indian aggressors. However, the Indian aggressors left irrefutable evidence in this military adventure. Indian military officers have taken back the bodies of several Indian soldiers and some weapons and ammunition left in Chinese territory, and have signed and sealed a document acknowledging that "Indian troops entered Chinese territory and conducted military provocations." This has given the Soviet revisionists a resounding slap in the face.

For a long time, the Soviet revisionists have followed the lead of U.S. imperialism, vigorously supporting and inciting the Indian reactionaries to engage in frenzied anti-China activities. This group of Soviet revisionist traitors not only politically supports the Indian reactionaries but also provides them with substantial economic aid and large-scale military assistance. In recent years, the Soviet revisionists have provided the Indian reactionary military with a large number of tanks, aircraft, missiles, and other modern weapons, and have helped India establish a series of military industries, including fighter aircraft assembly and manufacturing plants. The total value of military aid has reached nine billion dollars, surpassing U.S. military aid to India. This time, the Indian reactionary government sent its Defense Minister to Moscow, obviously to seek more weapons from its backers.

The Soviet revisionists claim that they are "supporting" the Indian people. But by giving the Indian reactionaries so many weapons, aren't you clearly supporting the Indian reactionaries in suppressing and massacring the revolutionary people within the country?

The Soviet revisionists claim that they are helping India "fight imperialism." But by giving the Indian reactionaries so many weapons, allowing them to invade Pakistan, aren't you clearly helping them pursue expansionism?

The Soviet revisionists loudly proclaim "peaceful coexistence," but this is also a lie. You provide the money and guns, and the Indian reactionaries provide the cannon fodder to attack socialist China. Aren't you, just like U.S. imperialism, driving Asians to fight Asians and vigorously undermining peaceful coexistence among Asian countries?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All parasites who depend on imperialism for their existence, no matter how they struggle for a while, their backers are ultimately unreliable."

No matter how much "aid" the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists give to the Indian reactionaries, the Indian reactionaries are still like a weakling who cannot be propped up. No matter how the Indian reactionaries sell themselves out to the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, they cannot escape their ultimate collapse. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists and all the parasites they raise will ultimately be buried by the revolutionary people of the world!

　　苏修集团是印度侵略者的后台
　　　　本报评论员
    十一日到十三日，印度反动派在中锡边境向中国进行严重军事挑衅。十四日，印度国防部长辛格就在众目睽睽之下，跑到莫斯科向它的主子邀功请赏去了。在那里，辛格向苏修集团汇报了“中印边境局势”，得到主子的大大奖励。这个事实，更加赤裸裸地暴露了苏修集团是策动印度反动派向中国发动军事挑衅的一个后台老板。
    在这一次印度军队进攻中国之前，苏修集团就开动宣传机器，大肆造谣，胡说什么中国正在加强西藏边境的军队，为印度的武装挑衅制造舆论。印度侵略军刚刚向中国边防部队开火，苏修集团就迫不及待地跳了出来，颠倒黑白，诬蔑中国先开第一枪，为印度侵略者推卸罪责。但是，印度侵略者在这次军事冒险活动中，留下了无可抵赖的罪证。印度军官已经把丢弃在中国境内的十几具印军尸体和一些武器弹药，如数领回，并且签字画押，承认“印度军队越入中国境内，进行军事挑衅”。这就狠狠地打了苏修集团一记响亮的耳光。
    长期以来，苏修集团一直追随美帝国主义，极力支持和怂恿印度反动派疯狂反华。这一伙苏修叛徒不仅在政治上扶植印度反动派，在经济上给它大量输血，而且还给它提供大规模的军事援助。近几年来，苏修集团给印度反动军队提供了大量的坦克、飞机、导弹等现代化武器，并且帮助印度建立了包括战斗机装配制造厂在内的一系列军事工业。军援总值达到九亿美元之多，超过了美国对印度的军援。这一次印度反动政府派遣国防部长到莫斯科去，显然又是为了向它的后台老板讨取更多的军火。
    苏修集团口口声声说，他们是“支持”印度人民的。但是，你们给印度反动派那么多武器，这不明明是支持印度反动派镇压和屠杀国内革命人民吗？
    苏修集团口口声声说，他们是帮助印度“反殖民主义”的。但是，你们给印度反动派那么多武器，让它侵略巴基斯坦，这不明明是帮助它推行扩张主义吗？
    苏修集团口口声声宣扬什么“和平共处”，这也是骗人的。你们出钱出枪，让印度反动派出炮灰，来进攻社会主义的中国，你们难道不是同美帝国主义一样，驱使亚洲人打亚洲人，极力破坏亚洲国家之间的和平共处吗？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一切依靠帝国主义过活的寄生虫，不论如何蠢动于一时，他们的后台总是靠不住的”。
    不管美帝和苏修给印度反动派多少“援助”，印度反动派还是扶不起来的阿斗。不管印度反动派怎样卖身投靠美帝苏修，他们终究逃避不了最后崩溃的命运。美帝苏修和它们所豢养的一切寄生虫，到头来通通要被世界革命人民彻底埋葬！
