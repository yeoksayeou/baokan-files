Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, elevate the revolutionary criticism to a new level. Resolutely defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Resolutely support the People's Liberation Army, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Revolutionary masses across the country continue to study the article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices. They unanimously agree that criticizing Tao Zhu, the loyal follower of the Chinese Khrushchev and a counter-revolutionary two-faced person, is an important step in thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 9th, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres across the country continue to seriously study and discuss the important article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, "On the Two Books by Tao Zhu." They expressed their determination to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to carry out the unified battle deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to resolutely support the People's Liberation Army, the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to guard against tendencies that disrupt our struggle direction from the ultra-"left" and right, and to advance resolutely along the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao!

Revolutionary masses pointed out that Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article provides a scientific and systematic criticism of Tao Zhu, which is a great impetus for better grasping the direction of the struggle and conducting a thorough revolutionary criticism. They are determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the revolutionary criticism, to strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, to guide petty-bourgeois thoughts onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, and to prevent a handful of counter-revolutionaries from using anarchist tendencies and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to sow discord, fish in troubled waters, divert the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in the capital said that the most important key to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. We are determined to throw ourselves into the revolutionary criticism and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics said that we guarantee to stop going out to make connections, and all those who went out will return to Beijing to conduct revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and reform of our school, making new contributions to the great unity of the revolutionary cadres of Beijing. The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Institute of Geology said that only by recognizing the direction of the struggle can we grasp the direction of the struggle. Revolutionary cadres must use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and prevent anyone from diverting the direction of the struggle from the ultra-"left" and right. The responsible person of the core group of the Beijing Workers' Congress said that we will not allow the class enemy to shake Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment even a bit. He said that a handful of bad leaders who manipulate the "May 16" counter-revolutionary organization are attempting to sabotage and split the leadership of the Party Central Committee led by the great leader Chairman Mao and to sabotage and split the great People's Liberation Army. We revolutionary cadres must resolutely counterattack.

Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, revolutionary cadres in Shanghai, who are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, continue to hold meetings and discussions today, denouncing the counter-revolutionary two-faced person and revisionist Tao Zhu. Revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Port said after studying Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article that Tao Zhu-style counter-revolutionary two-faced persons are adept at playing both sides. If we have small-groupism, individualism, and other petty-bourgeois ideas in our minds, we will easily be deceived and tricked by them. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break private interests and establish public interests, constantly reform our worldview, and forever follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance bravely. Revolutionary cadres in Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Qinghai, and other provinces pointed out that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and thoroughly criticizing and exposing the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a great historical task for revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Guizhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army jointly issued a notice, calling on all levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary mass organizations, and all cadres and soldiers to seriously study Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. The Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province held a standing committee meeting on the 9th, specially studying Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article. Everyone expressed their determination to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and elevate the revolutionary criticism in the province to a new level.

Revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in Ningxia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Henan, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Sichuan, Jilin, and other places continue to carry out activities to study Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article today. They expressed that if the class enemy wants to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must resolutely defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; if the enemy wants to sabotage the unity between the military and the people, we must especially strengthen the unity between the military and the people; if the enemy wants to use some anarchist tendencies and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to disrupt our struggle direction, we must resolutely overcome anarchist tendencies and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and advance resolutely along the direction of the struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao, pushing the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide and elevating it to a new level.

More than twenty thousand warriors of the Revolutionary Command Headquarters of the proletariat in Ningxia and the People's Liberation Army cadres and soldiers fighting side by side with them held a grand rally and parade on the 9th. The responsible person of the Revolutionary Command Headquarters said in his speech that we are determined to defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with practical actions, forever unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and win together. The class enemy's conspiracy to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord will definitely be smashed to pieces in front of the iron wall of military-civilian unity! Members of the preparatory group of the Revolutionary Committee of Henan Province, responsible persons of the provincial military region and stationed troops, held a special meeting to study and discuss Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article in the afternoon of the 9th. They expressed that they would defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment as they would protect their eyes, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Some revolutionary cadres of the "August 7th Commune" said that we love the People's Liberation Army the most. The fighting friendship between us and the Liberation Army cannot be blown down by a typhoon of level 12, nor can it be destroyed by thunder of ten thousand jin. The Great Wall of military-civilian unity will forever stand on the central plain. Revolutionary warriors of the "Red Second Headquarters" in Xinjiang said that Xinjiang is on the front line of the anti-revisionist struggle, and the class enemy will definitely try every means to disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and sabotage the unity between the military and the people. We must engage in a head-on struggle with the enemy. Some responsible persons of the Revolutionary United Command Headquarters of Zhejiang Province expressed that they would use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, take the lead in overcoming "only I am left," "only I am revolutionary," and other non-proletarian thoughts, break private interests and establish public interests, start from the overall situation, start from the interests of the state, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and contribute all their strength to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary mass organizations such as "Three Steel," "Three New," and "Three Headquarters Revolutionary Alliance" in Wuhan, "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" in Hunan Province, "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" in Jiangxi Province, as well as revolutionary cadres in Guangzhou, Nanning, and other places, today all angrily exposed and denounced the crimes of Tao Zhu, Wang Renzhong, and others in sabotaging the cultural revolution in these regions. They expressed that they would definitely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, conduct a thorough revolutionary criticism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Soldiers of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region held a criticism meeting and wrote big-character posters immediately after listening to the broadcast of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of Tao Zhu.
