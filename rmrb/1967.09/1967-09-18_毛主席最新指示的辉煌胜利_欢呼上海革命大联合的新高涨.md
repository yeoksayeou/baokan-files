The banks of the Huangpu River resound with songs, red flags flutter, and countless small teams of revolutionary mass organizations converge into an unprecedentedly magnificent and surging tide of the great army of the Cultural Revolution. The birthplace of the "January Revolution" - Shanghai - has seen a new surge in revolutionary great unity amidst the revolutionary criticism, once again setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary masses across the nation. We enthusiastically cheer for this new surge in revolutionary great unity!

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest directive: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions.

Chairman Mao's latest directive is the guiding principle for achieving revolutionary great unity.

Chairman Mao's latest directive is the code of conduct for correctly handling the relationships between revolutionary mass organizations.

Chairman Mao's latest directive is a crucial guarantee for achieving new victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The Shanghai working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from various fronts, have swiftly and resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's latest directive. In just a few days, the main industrial systems and ten districts in the city have basically achieved revolutionary great unity. Many revolutionary masses of the proletariat from various fronts have also united.

Achieving revolutionary great unity is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Today, whether we can resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's latest directive is the key to mobilizing tens of millions of people, forming a vast army, and achieving revolutionary great unity. It is the decisive factor in carrying out revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform. This is also a stern test for every revolutionary mass organization and every revolutionary fighter on whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and whether they are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The Shanghai working class has said it well: "Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do."

Chairman Mao's latest directive, we must execute it without any deviation or condition. Those who understand must execute it resolutely, and those who do not understand temporarily must also execute it resolutely and deepen their understanding through execution. Between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, if one faction does not understand, the other faction must actively promote them to achieve revolutionary great unity. If the leaders do not understand, the broad masses of fighters must actively push them to achieve revolutionary great unity.

Chairman Mao's latest directive, we must say what we do and do what we say. It is not just about verbally supporting it, but more importantly, about implementing it in action. Engels said well, "One judges a person not by his declarations but by his actions; not by what he says he is but by what he does and actually is." To talk but not to act, to have inconsistent words and deeds, is a manifestation of impure party spirit and work style, and it is the small-bourgeois factionalism at work. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, must not be "giants in words, dwarfs in action."

Whether Chairman Mao's latest directive can be truly executed and put into practice is crucial. It requires a great struggle in the mind to overcome private interests and establish public interests. We must use the proletarian party spirit to overcome anarchism, sectarianism, and small-groupism, and use the proletarian revolutionary program of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to replace the programs of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie that are centered on "self" and small hills. If a person carries the heavy burden of "self" and small-groupism and treats it as a treasure, he will be weighed down and unable to see the path guided by Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, in the revolutionary great unity, he can only play a hindering role and cannot play a promoting role.

"Many things are urgent; the earth turns, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment."

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we must gather in the great ranks of revolutionary great unity with the fastest steps, concentrate our strength, focus our targets, and open fire on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as the chief, promote the struggle, criticism, and reform of various units, and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

### 毛主席最新指示的辉煌胜利——欢呼上海革命大联合的新高涨

    毛主席最新指示的辉煌胜利
    ——欢呼上海革命大联合的新高涨
    黄浦江畔，歌声震天，红旗飞舞，千万支革命群众组织的小分队，汇合成空前雄伟、波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化革命大军的洪流。“一月革命”风暴的发源地——上海，在革命的大批判中出现了革命大联合的新高涨，又一次为全国的无产阶级革命派作出了光辉的榜样。我们为这个革命大联合的新高涨热烈欢呼！
    最近，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新的指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
    毛主席的最新指示，是实现革命大联合的指导方针。
    毛主席的最新指示，是正确处理革命群众组织之间关系的行动准则。
    毛主席的最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命新胜利的重要保证。
    具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级和各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，最迅速、最坚决地按照毛主席的这个最新指示办事。在短短的几天内，全市主要的产业系统和十个区的工人革命群众组织，基本上实现了革命大联合。许多战线上的无产阶级革命派，也联合起来了。
    实现革命的大联合，是毛主席的伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分。在今天，能否坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，是能否调动千千万万群众，组成浩浩荡荡的大军，实现革命大联合的关键，是能否搞好革命的大批判和斗批改的决定性因素。这也是对于每一个革命群众组织和每一个革命战士，是否忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是否紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的一个严峻考验。
    上海的工人阶级说得好：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干。”
    毛主席的最新指示，我们就是要不折不扣地、无条件地执行。理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，并在执行中加深理解。在无产阶级革命派之间，这一派不通，另一派就要主动地促进他们搞革命的大联合。头头思想不通，广大战士就要积极地推动他们搞革命的大联合。
    毛主席的最新指示，我们要说到做到，言行一致。不仅只在口头上拥护，更重要的是落实在行动上。恩格斯说得好，“判断一个人当然不是看他的声明，而是看他的行为；不是看他自称如何如何，而是看他做些什么和实际是怎样一个人。”只说不干，言论和行动不一致，这是党性不纯、作风不纯的表现，这是小资产阶级的派性在作怪。我们无产阶级革命派，我们无产阶级革命事业的接班人，切切不可做“言语的巨人，行动的矮子”。
    毛主席的最新指示，能否真正得到执行，付之实践，关键是必须在头脑里展开一场破私立公的大决战。我们要用无产阶级的党性战胜无政府主义、宗派主义、小团体主义等小资产阶级的派性，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命纲领，去代替资产阶级、小资产阶级的“私”字的纲领、小山头的纲领。一个人如果背着“私”字这块大石头、小团体主义这块大石头，还当作宝贝不放，就会使自己压得抬不起头来，看不见毛泽东思想指引的路。这样，在革命的大联合中，就只能起阻碍的作用，而不能够起促进的作用。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，我们要以最迅速的步伐，集结在革命大联合的伟大行列里，集中力量，集中目标，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火，推动各单位的斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
