Go to the students, bravely join the great criticism ranks.

Chairman Mao says: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat even better." Through the help of my fellow students and by engaging in heart-to-heart talks and revolutionary criticism with them, I have come to understand: revolutionary teachers must go to the students and work together with them to carry out the great criticism.

Due to the suppression and persecution by the bourgeois reactionary line, I was once isolated from my fellow students. In the early stages of the movement, when the situation in the school turned into one of the masses fighting the masses, my fellow students had doubts: Isn't it that most cadres are good or relatively good? Isn't it that we should unite with ninety-five percent? But those who implemented the reactionary line in our school said things like: "Didn't your class just fight against one teacher? The ninety-five percent might not apply to your school!" They deceived and misled the students in this way.

Later, my fellow students angrily criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and unanimously directed their hatred towards the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. I also joined my fellow students in angrily denouncing the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line against me and my fellow students; I denounced the harm caused by "Cultivation of the Self." The fighting friendship and the actions of the great criticism have bound me closely with my fellow students, and I have come to be among them.

Going to the students also involved a struggle within myself to overcome selfish thoughts. The class organized the "Sea Swallow" combat team, and my fellow students, in order to better help me, urged me to join the combat team. At first, due to my insufficient revolutionary spirit, I had many reservations: on one hand, I wanted to fight alongside my fellow students, but on the other hand, I was afraid that if the combat team ran into problems, they might trace it back to me. Therefore, I hesitated and did not dare to join. My fellow students noticed my conflicting thoughts and wholeheartedly helped me, pointing out sharply: "Are you afraid of being blamed for being the 'backstage manipulator'? This is not being extremely responsible to the revolutionary cause; this is the 'self' at work, planning for oneself." Under the sincere help of my fellow students, I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must serve the people's interests. If there are mistakes, they must be corrected; this is what it means to be responsible to the people." I realized that my thoughts were wrong. My fellow students organized the combat team, but I put 'self' first and 'fear' first, not daring to fight alongside them, not daring to support them wholeheartedly. This action did not serve the people's interests and did not align with Chairman Mao's teachings. I could no longer hesitate, so I joined the "Sea Swallow" combat team and, together with my fellow students, wrote big-character posters, held criticism meetings, organized classes to make revolution, and together launched a great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Through the joint struggle with my fellow students and the great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, I deeply felt that revolutionary teachers must combine with revolutionary youngsters. The youngsters are full of vigor and have a strong revolutionary spirit, with many admirable qualities worth learning from. Revolutionary teachers must go to the students to better reform themselves and to criticize deeply and thoroughly the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

### 到同学中去，勇敢地加入大批判的行列

　　到同学中去，勇敢地加入大批判的行列
    毛主席说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”通过同学们的帮助，通过和同学们一块开展谈心活动，一块开展革命的大批判，我认识到：革命教师一定要到同学中去，和同学一道把革命大批判搞好。
    由于资产阶级反动路线的打击、迫害，曾经把我和同学隔离开了。在运动初期，当学校里出现群众斗群众的局面时，同学们曾经提出怀疑：不是干部多数是好的和比较好的吗？不是要团结百分之九十五吗？可是在我校执行反动路线的人却说什么：“你们班不是就斗争了一位老师嘛！百分之九十五在你们学校不一定适用！”他们就是这样欺骗、蒙蔽同学。
    后来，同学们愤怒地批判了资产阶级反动路线，一致把仇恨集中到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上。我也和同学一起愤怒地控诉了资产阶级反动路线对我和同学们的迫害；控诉了《修养》对我的毒害。战斗的友谊、大批判的行动，把我和同学紧紧联在一起，我到同学中间来了。
    到同学中去，我也是经历了一番克服私心杂念的斗争的。班里组织了“海燕”战斗队，同学们为了更好地帮助我，动员我参加战斗队。开始，由于我革命造反劲头不足，有不少顾虑：一方面愿意和同学一起战斗，另一方面又怕将来战斗队出了问题，揪后台揪到我这儿。所以我一直犹犹豫豫，不敢参加。同学们发现了我的活思想，就满腔热忱地帮助我，一针见血地向我指出：你是不是怕揪后台，这可不是对革命事业极端地负责任，这是“私”字作怪，是在替自己打算。在同学们的诚恳帮助下，我又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”我认识到自己的思想是很不对头的。同学们组织战斗队，自己却“私”字当头，“怕”字当头，不敢和同学一起战斗，不敢热情地支持他们，这个行动是不符合人民利益的，是不符合毛主席的教导的。我再也不能犹豫了，于是参加了“海燕”战斗队，和同学一起写大字报，开批判会，组织复课闹革命，一块向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大批判。
    通过和同学们的共同战斗，通过对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，我深深地体会到，革命教师必须和革命小将结合起来。小将们朝气蓬勃，革命造反劲头十足，有许许多多值得我们学习的优点。革命教师只有到同学中去，才能更好地改造自己，才能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批深批臭。
