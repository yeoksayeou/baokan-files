British imperialism's recent illegal measures and fascist atrocities against the Chinese Embassy and other institutions in Britain have aroused the extreme indignation of the British people and Asian, African, and Latin American friends in Britain. They strongly condemn the British authorities' anti-China crimes and express their resolute support for the Chinese government's principled stance and the just struggle of Chinese personnel in Britain.

On the afternoon of the 27th, dozens of British and Asian, African, and Latin American progressives, despite threats from British police, gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy, which was surrounded by a large number of British police and plainclothes agents. They held up copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," read aloud from some passages, and enthusiastically shouted, "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand years!" The Chinese acting ambassador, Shen Ping, and many colleagues from the embassy came to the door, joining the foreign friends in loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and raising their fists to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand years!" The British police and plainclothes agents standing by were stunned and bewildered by the scene.

The embassy staff held a discussion with the foreign friends. Hosts and guests sang revolutionary songs in different languages, including "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "The Internationale."

When these foreign friends entered the embassy, a reactionary bourgeois newspaper reporter attempted to sneak in but was immediately exposed and dragged out. A young friend angrily accused him of being an enemy of the Chinese and British peoples. The man, enraged and stammering, threatened, "Y-you dare to stand with the Chinese people?!" The young friend, with a stern face, replied loudly, "We stand with the seven hundred million Chinese people!"

Despite the British police and plainclothes agents completely surrounding the Chinese embassy on the 30th, attempting to cut off its contact with the outside world, many people still came in a continuous stream to express their condolences and support.

A group of British progressive young workers came to the Chinese embassy on the 30th, expressing their solidarity with the Chinese people. They eagerly listened to Wang Zhenpu, an embassy staff member who was injured in the struggle against British police violence on the 29th, recount the details of the anti-violence struggle. One friend, after listening, said excitedly, "Your struggle has greatly inspired the fighting will of all oppressed peoples in the world!" Another young friend said, "Because of your struggle, people have seen more clearly that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" They emphasized that no matter how the British Empire opposes China, the British people and the British working class will show their solidarity with the great Chinese people in every way.

At the end of the meeting, the British workers and embassy staff shouted in unison, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of Britain and China!" "Long live the world revolution!" "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!"

Some leaders of the Indian Workers' Association in Britain also visited the Chinese embassy in the afternoon of the 30th, expressing their warm regards and presenting a resolution to the embassy's leaders. The resolution stated that the Central Executive Committee of the Indian Workers' Association in Britain, representing Indian workers in Britain, pays tribute to the heroic Chinese comrades who defend the great dignity of the People's Republic of China.

In recent days, the Chinese embassy has also received a large number of letters from the British people. They enthusiastically requested copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and strongly condemned the British government's fascist atrocities.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英帝国主义最近对中国驻英代办处等机构所采取的一系列非法措施和法西斯暴行，激起了英国广大人民和在英国的亚、非、拉朋友的无比愤慨，他们强烈谴责英国当局的反华罪行，并且表示坚决支持中国政府的严正立场和中国驻英人员进行的正义斗争。
    二十七日下午，数十名英国和在英国的亚、非、拉进步人士不顾英国警察的威胁，来到被大批英国警察和便衣特务包围的中国驻英代办处门前，他们高举《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读其中的一些段落，并激昂慷慨地高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”中国驻英临时代办沈平同代办处的许多同志来到门前，同外国朋友们一起高声朗诵毛主席语录并振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”站在旁边的英国警察和便衣特务被这种场面吓得目瞪口呆、张惶失措。
    代办处的同志们同外国朋友进行了座谈。宾主用不同的语言高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《国际歌》等革命歌曲。
    当这些外国朋友进入代办处时，一个反动的资产阶级报纸记者企图混进去，但是当场就被揪了出来，一位青年朋友愤怒地指责他是中国人民和英国人民的敌人。这个家伙老羞成怒，结结巴巴地威胁说，“你、你敢和中国人站在一起？！”这位青年朋友横眉冷对，高声回答说，“我们就是要同七亿中国人民站在一起！”
    尽管英国警察和便衣特务三十日已完全包围了中国代办处，企图隔绝它同外界的联系，但是许多人还是络绎不绝地前往中国代办处表示慰问和支持。
    一群英国进步青年工人三十日集体来到中国代办处，表示他们同中国人民的坚强的团结。他们还以兴奋的心情听取了二十九日在反击英国警察暴行斗争中受伤的代办处工作人员王振谱介绍抗暴斗争的情况。一位朋友听了后激动地说：“你们的斗争极大地鼓舞了世界上一切被压迫人民的战斗意志！”另一位青年朋友说，“由于你们的斗争，使人们更加清楚地看到帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”他们强调指出，不管英帝如何反对中国，英国人民和英国工人阶级将通过一切方式显示他们同伟大的中国人民的团结。
    在会见结束时，英国工人和代办处的工作人员同声高呼：“英中两国人民友谊万岁！”“世界人民革命万岁！”“世界人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    在英国的印度工人协会的一些负责人三十日下午也前往中国代办处，亲切慰问，并向代办处的负责人递交了一项决议。决议说，在英国的印度工人协会中央执行委员会，代表在英国的印度工人，向维护中华人民共和国伟大尊严的代办处的英雄的中国同志致敬。
    连日来，中国代办处还收到了大批英国人民的来信。他们热情要求得到《毛主席语录》，并强烈谴责英国政府的法西斯暴行。
