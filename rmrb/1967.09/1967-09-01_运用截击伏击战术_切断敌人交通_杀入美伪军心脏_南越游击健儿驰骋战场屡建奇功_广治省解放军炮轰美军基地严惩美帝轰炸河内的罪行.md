In the vast battlefields of South Vietnam, guerrilla fighters are displaying their prowess. They have recently achieved new and outstanding victories in many battles.

Guerrilla units in various regions have flexibly employed tactics of ambush, interception, and surprise attacks, frequently launching offensives against the enemy, annihilating many enemy forces, and foiling the enemy's numerous "sweeping" operations. The guerrilla units of the three counties of Quảng Điền, Phú Điền, and Hương Trà in Thừa Thiên Province alone killed more than 110 U.S.-puppet soldiers from August 14 to 24. On August 18, two battalions of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division were sent to "sweep" through the area of Cần Đước District in Bình Dương Province. As soon as these U.S. troops set foot on the land of the village of Cần Đước, they fell into a minefield that the guerrillas had already laid, with more than 100 of them being blown to pieces on the spot. The remaining U.S. aggressors were so terrified that they dared not advance a single step and camped on the spot for three days. On the fourth day, they fled with their tails between their legs.

Guerrilla units in many places have also repeatedly infiltrated into the enemy's heartland, severely punishing the U.S. aggressors and puppet thugs, striking fear into the enemy's hearts. On July 13, the guerrilla unit of Huế City in Thừa Thiên Province bravely attacked the 209 Restaurant set up by the U.S. aggressors on the Chợ Lớn Road, throwing grenades at the dining table of the U.S. intelligence agency's spy officers, killing 30 U.S. aggressors. This outstanding raid by the guerrilla unit greatly boosted the morale of the people of Huế City. In mid-July, the guerrilla units of the counties of Hương Trà, Quảng Điền, and Phú Điền in Thừa Thiên Province had repeatedly infiltrated into enemy-occupied areas, killing and capturing more than ten bloodthirsty puppet thugs and local puppet government officials, seriously disrupting the enemy's "pacification" schemes in Thừa Thiên and Quảng Trị Provinces.

Guerrilla units are also very active on various water and land transportation routes, causing the enemy heavy losses. In early August, the guerrilla unit of Ninh Thuận Province fought more than ten battles on the road from Ninh Thuận City to Ninh Hải County, blowing up a large bridge, cutting off enemy communications, and annihilating 78 U.S. soldiers and 25 puppet soldiers. On July 30, the guerrilla unit of Châu Thành County in Châu Đốc Province blew up the Chợ Rẫy Bridge and the Chợ Rẫy Bridge on National Highway 4, cutting off the road from Châu Đốc to Cần Thơ, annihilating many enemy forces. The guerrilla units of Mỹ Tho and Gò Công Provinces coordinated their actions from August 7 to 15, cutting off many road sections. Along National Highway 24 from Mỹ Tho to Gò Công alone, more than ten sections were cut off, and dozens of defending enemy forces were annihilated.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, to punish the U.S. bandits for their mad bombing of Hanoi as part of their "escalation" of the war, the artillery units of the Liberation Army of Quảng Trị Province launched fierce artillery bombardments on the U.S. military bases at Đông Hà, Dư Lễ, and Dư Lăng, which are located near the 17th parallel, from 5:07 to 9:50 on August 28, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

According to preliminary reports, at the Đông Hà base, the artillery shells of the Liberation Army accurately hit the command center, airport, fuel depot, ammunition depot, and the camp of the U.S. Marine Corps. The fuel depot caught fire, and the ammunition depot exploded for an hour. Many helicopters and armored vehicles were destroyed, and many U.S. soldiers were killed or wounded.

At the Dư Lễ and Dư Lăng bases, the artillery fire of the Liberation Army immediately silenced the enemy's cannons, and many shells hit the enemy who were fleeing in panic, killing and wounding many.

　　运用截击伏击战术  切断敌人交通  杀入美伪军心脏
　　南越游击健儿驰骋战场屡建奇功
　　广治省解放军炮轰美军基地严惩美帝轰炸河内的罪行
    新华社河内三十一日电　在越南南方广阔的战场上，游击健儿大显身手，他们最近在许多次战斗中，又建立了新的出色战功。
    各地游击队灵活地运用袭击、截击和伏击等战术，向敌人频频发动进攻，歼灭了许多敌人，同时粉碎了敌人发动的多次“扫荡”。承天省广田、丰田和香茶三个县的游击队，仅在八月十四日到二十四日期间就消灭美伪军一百一十多名。八月十八日，美国第一步兵师出动两个营的兵力到土龙木省边葛县“扫荡”。这批美军刚踏上龙源乡卡那村的土地，就落入了游击队早已布下的地雷阵，当场被炸死一百多名。残存的美国侵略军吓得丧魂失魄，一步也不敢继续前进，就地宿营三天，第四天，夹着尾巴灰溜溜地逃跑了。
    许多地方的游击队还多次深入敌人心脏地区，严惩美国侵略军和伪军恶棍，打得敌人惶惶不可终日。承天省顺化市游击队七月十三日在芝陵路英勇袭击为美国侵略军开设的第二○九餐馆，把手榴弹扔在坐满美国情报机构的特务军官的餐桌旁，炸死美国侵略军三十名。游击队的这一出色的袭击战，使顺化市人民万分振奋。在七月中旬，承天省香水、广田和丰田等县游击队曾多次潜入敌占区，打死和活捉十多名血债累累的伪军恶棍和地方伪政权头目，严重打击了敌人对承天和广治两省的“绥靖”阴谋。
    在各条水陆交通线上游击队也十分活跃，给敌人造成许多严重损失。新安省游击队八月初在新安市到新柱县城的公路上，接连战斗十多次，炸毁一座大桥，切断敌人交通，消灭美军七十八名和伪军二十五名。朔庄省周城县胡德健乡游击队，七月三十日在第四号公路上炸毁茶更桥和茶桂桥，切断了从朔庄到芹苴的公路，消灭许多敌人。美萩、鹅贡两省游击队，在八月七日到十五日期间配合作战，切断许多路段。仅从美萩到鹅贡的二十四号公路，就被切断十多段，数十名守敌被歼灭。
    新华社河内三十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：为了惩罚美国强盗疯狂轰炸河内的战争“升级”罪行，越南南方广治省解放军炮兵部队，八月二十八日五时七分到九时五十分，接连向美国侵略军设在紧临十七度线的东河、育庙和犹灵等军事基地发动猛烈炮轰，使敌人遭到严重损失。
    据初步消息，在东河基地，解放军的炮弹准确地击中基地的指挥所、机场、汽油库、弹药库和美国海军陆战队的营地。汽油库被击中起火，弹药库的爆炸声延续一个小时之久。许多直升飞机和装甲车被击毁，许多美军被炸死炸伤。
    在育庙和犹灵基地，解放军的炮火一开始就把敌人的大炮打哑，多发炮弹击中正在抱头鼠窜的敌人，打死打伤许多名。
