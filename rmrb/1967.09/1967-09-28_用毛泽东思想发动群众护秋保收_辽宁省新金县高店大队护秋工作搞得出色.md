The People's Daily reports: The revolutionary and production promotion leadership group of Gaodian Brigade in Zanzhehe Commune, Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, has used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to propagate and organize the masses, doing an excellent job in protecting the autumn harvest.

Gaodian Brigade is the granary of Xinjin County. This year, with the help of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, this brigade has earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." The crops are flourishing and the harvest is bountiful, presenting a scene of abundance everywhere.

The better the harvest, the more envious the enemy becomes. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party will not readily admit defeat. They will surely spread malicious rumors and incite trouble, colluding with the ghosts and snakes in society to sabotage the autumn harvest. The revolutionary masses and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants must be highly vigilant and guard against the enemy's sabotage.

The revolutionary and production promotion leadership group of Gaodian Brigade analyzed the current class struggle situation and realized that protecting the autumn harvest is to safeguard the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. How to do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest? They studied Chairman Mao's relevant works, reviewed the past experiences and lessons of protecting the autumn harvest, and believed that only by emphasizing politics, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, trusting the masses, and relying on the masses, can the broad revolutionary masses be mobilized to monitor the enemy's plots and sabotage activities, and thus do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest.

Gaodian Brigade selected a group of backbone personnel to form Mao Zedong Thought autumn harvest protection propaganda teams or propaganda groups, which went deep into the production teams to conduct extensive propaganda. In addition to propagating the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to the broad masses, they also compiled fast-talking, catchy phrases, and lyrics about the importance of protecting the autumn harvest and loving the collective, and performed them throughout the brigade, making them known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Once, a propagandist from Wangtun Production Team saw a herdsman not properly taking care of the livestock and conducted propaganda and education for him. The herdsman was moved and said, "You can rest assured, I will definitely take good care of the livestock from now on." Since then, this herdsman not only took good care of the livestock himself but also educated other herdsmen to take good care of the livestock.

Gaodian Brigade used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the work of protecting the autumn harvest, greatly enhancing the broad masses' understanding of the work of protecting the autumn harvest. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest, held family meetings several times to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate their children to care for the collective and love the crops. Many poor and lower-middle peasants also formulated agreements for protecting the autumn harvest, often going out at night to monitor the movements of class enemies. Under the efforts of the broad revolutionary masses, the work of protecting the autumn harvest in Gaodian Brigade was done excellently.

　　用毛泽东思想发动群众护秋保收
　　辽宁省新金县高店大队护秋工作搞得出色
    本报讯　辽宁省新金县赞子河公社高店大队抓革命促生产领导小组，以毛泽东思想为武器，宣传群众，组织群众，做好护秋的工作。
    高店大队是新金县的粮仓。今年，这个大队在人民解放军某部的帮助下，认真贯彻执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，满山遍野的庄稼长的棵壮穗粗，到处呈现出一派丰收景象。
    年景越好，敌人越眼红。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决不甘心失败，必然地要煽阴风，点邪火，同社会上牛鬼蛇神串通一气，破坏秋收。无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农必须百倍提高警惕，严防敌人的破坏。
    高店大队抓革命促生产领导小组分析了当前的阶级斗争形势，认识到护秋保收，就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的成果。怎样把护秋工作做好呢？他们学习了毛主席的有关著作，回顾了过去护秋工作的经验教训，认为只有突出政治，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，宣传群众，组织群众，相信群众，依靠群众，让广大革命群众都来监视敌人的阴谋破坏活动，才能把护秋工作搞好。
    高店大队抓革命促生产领导小组选拔了一批骨干人员，组成毛泽东思想护秋宣传队或宣传组，深入生产队大张旗鼓地进行宣传。除向广大社员宣传“老三篇”外，还把护秋保收的重要意义和热爱集体、关心集体的新人新事，编成快板、顺口溜、唱词等演唱材料，在全大队宣传演出，做到家喻户晓，深入人心。有一次，王屯生产队的宣传员看见一个放牧员不好好看管牲畜，就对他进行宣传教育，放牧员听了感动地说：“你放心吧，俺今后一定把牲畜看管好。”从此，这个放牧员不但自己把牲畜看管的很严，同时还教育别的放牧员也把牲畜看管好。
    高店大队用毛泽东思想统帅护秋工作，大大提高了广大社员对护秋工作的认识。不少贫下中农为了把护秋工作搞好，几次召开家庭会，用毛泽东思想教育子女关心集体，爱护庄稼。不少贫下中农还制定了护秋保收公约，经常在晚间走出家门监视阶级敌人的一举一动。在广大革命群众的努力下，高店大队的护秋工作搞得很出色。
