People in the world who have the hearts of beasts but the faces of humans are most afraid of having their ugly natures exposed. The counter-revolutionary revisionist scum like Zhou Yang are exactly like this. Zhou Yang has a piece of black jargon that fully exposes this point. He viciously cursed, “If you’re not careful, you’ll fall into the rightist abyss, reactionary abyss, right-opportunist abyss, revisionist abyss. There are too many abysses, and if you fall in, you’ll be doomed forever. In the future, let’s make fewer abysses, and if you fall in, don’t say it’s falling into revisionism, just say it’s falling into a small mistake, then you won’t be afraid.”

Black jargon needs to be analyzed. Zhou Yang’s so-called “falling into the abyss” is, in essence, referring to their counter-revolutionary faces being exposed by the revolutionary people. Zhou Yang, the head of the literary and artistic black line, has been rolling in the revisionist abyss for a long time, thoroughly promoting capitalist restoration, but he puts on a rogue’s face, cursing “too many abysses” and not allowing people to expose his old tricks, which is truly outrageous! Behind the rogue, there must be a conspiracy. We must expose Zhou Yang’s old tricks of cursing “too many abysses”!

Let’s not talk about Zhou Yang himself, but in the past seventeen years, under the orders of his master, Zhou Yang has used “small mistakes” to protect how many bad guys! For example, the extremely reactionary traitor Zhou Zuoren has “never opposed communism,” Xia Yan’s anti-party activities are “issues of understanding,” Shao Quanlin’s vicious attacks on the Three Red Banners are just “issues of literary thought” and so on. The crimes of these groups of scoundrels were all wiped out by Zhou Yang with “small mistakes,” and one by one, they climbed up the soft ladder of “small mistakes,” rising to high positions and being highly valued.

Why is Zhou Yang afraid of “too many abysses” and desperately protecting his comrades? The reason lies in the eight characters Zhou Yang himself said, “once you fall in, you’ll be doomed forever.” “Restoration” means restoration. This sentence should be interpreted as “once exposed, restoration is impossible.” Zhou Yang has worked hard for nothing but restoration! In order to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration, a line of surrender and betrayal must be promoted, and various methods must be used to protect all the ghosts and snakes, social dregs, and use them as their crusaders to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. If the revolutionary people expose their counter-revolutionary faces and throw them into the garbage heap of history, Zhou Yang and his master Liu Shaoqi’s capitalist restoration dream will not be completely shattered? No wonder Zhou Yang sees our criticism of revisionism and is terrified, screaming “too many abysses!”

　　“深渊”与复辟
　　李广大
    世上凡人面兽心的家伙，最害怕人家揭穿他的丑恶本质，反革命修正主义分子周扬之流便是如此。周扬有一段黑话充分暴露了这一点。他恶狠狠地骂道：“一不小心掉入右派深渊，反动深渊，右倾机会主义深渊，修正主义深渊。深渊太多了，一下跌入，万劫不复。以后少搞点深渊，掉进去也不要说成是掉入修正主义了，就说是掉入一个小小的错误，这样子就不会害怕了。”
    黑话要分析着看。周扬的所谓“掉入深渊”，说穿了，就是指他们的反革命嘴脸被革命人民揭露。周扬这个文艺黑线的头目，长期以来在修正主义深渊里打滚，大搞资本主义复辟，却摆出一副无赖相，咒骂“深渊太多”，不准人家揭他的老底，真是岂有此理！无赖的背后必有阴谋。我们偏要揭揭周扬痛骂“深渊太多”的老底！
    且不说周扬自己，单说十七年来周扬在其主子的指使下，用“小小的错误”庇护了多少坏家伙！什么反动透顶的大汉奸周作人“从来不曾反对过共产主义”啦，夏衍反党是“认识问题”啦，邵荃麟恶毒地攻击三面红旗只是“文艺思想”有问题啦……如此等等。这些狐群狗党的累累罪恶不仅被周扬用“小小的错误”一笔勾销，而且一个个踩着“小小的错误”的软梯爬了上来，青云直上，备受重用。
    周扬为什么害怕“深渊太多”，拚命地保护他的同伙？原因就在周扬自己说的“一下跌入，万劫不复”这八个字上。“复”，就是复辟。这句话应解作“一旦暴露，无法复辟”。周扬辛辛苦苦不就是为了一个复辟么？既要实现反革命复辟，就要推行一条招降纳叛的反革命组织路线，采取种种办法，把那些牛鬼蛇神、社会渣滓统统保护起来，作为他们颠覆无产阶级专政的十字军。倘若革命人民揭穿了他们的反革命嘴脸，把他们扔到历史的垃圾堆里，周扬之流及其主子中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦不就彻底破灭了？难怪周扬一见到我们批判修正主义就丧魂落魄，狂呼“深渊太多了”！
