The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's mouthpiece, *Izvestia*, recently published an article on the occasion of Indonesia's 22nd anniversary of independence. The article lavishly praised the fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution, openly exposing the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with the Indonesian reactionaries and their betrayal of the Indonesian people's revolutionary cause.

The article did not mention how the fascist military clique, which has been acting as a loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism since the 1965 counter-revolutionary coup, has carried out unprecedented white terror domestically, massacring hundreds of thousands of Communists and revolutionary people. Internationally, they have closely coordinated with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their anti-China chorus, repeatedly launching large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns. Instead, the article absurdly claimed that under this fascist military regime, Indonesia is an "independent country actively opposing imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism," and therefore, it has always received "sympathy and support" from the Soviet Union.

The article turned black into white, portraying the fascist military regime in Indonesia, which actively colludes with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, betrays national interests, and has ruined the Indonesian economy, as a regime that "cares about maintaining and strengthening its national independence, and the comprehensive rise of its economy and culture." The article extolled the Soviet revisionists as "loyal friends" of the Indonesian fascist military regime, boasting about the Soviet revisionists' so-called "aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries, and expressing a determination to further tightly collude with this fascist military regime.

　　苏修同印尼反动派何其亲也
　　大肆吹捧印尼反动政府是什么“积极反帝”的国家
    公然表示自己是印尼法西斯军人政权的“忠实朋友”
    据新华社讯　莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义领导集团的喉舌《消息报》，最近就印度尼西亚独立二十二周年发表文章，大肆吹捧以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼法西斯军人政权，不打自招地暴露了苏修领导集团勾结印尼反动派，出卖印尼人民革命事业的叛徒嘴脸。
    这篇文章，只字不提充当美帝苏修的忠实走狗的印尼法西斯军人集团从一九六五年发动反革命政变以来，在国内实行史无前例的白色恐怖，屠杀几十万共产党人和革命人民；在国际上密切配合美帝苏修反华大合唱，再三掀起大规模的反华排华浪潮的反革命罪行。相反，它胡说什么在这个法西斯军人政权统治下的印尼，是“积极反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的独立国家”，因此，它始终得到苏联的“同情和支持”。
    文章颠倒黑白，把积极投靠美帝苏修，出卖民族利益，把印尼经济搞得一团糟的印尼法西斯军人政权，说成是它“关心于维护和加强自己的民族独立、全面的经济和文化高涨”。文章大肆宣扬苏修是印尼法西斯军人政权的“忠实朋友”，吹嘘苏修对印尼反动派的所谓“援助”，并表示要坚决同这个法西斯军人政权更加紧密地勾结在一起。
