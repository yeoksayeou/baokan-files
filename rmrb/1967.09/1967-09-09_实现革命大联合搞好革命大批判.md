The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" has sounded the new charge for revolutionary great criticism.

Over the past year, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has convincingly proven that the great strategic deployment formulated by Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, most scientifically reflects the objective laws of class struggle and is the fundamental guarantee of our victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Now, the warriors of the Dongfanghong Commune in our factory are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a high tide of revolutionary great criticism throughout the factory. We are concentrating our firepower and targets to systematically criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, while closely combining this with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our unit.

However, in our victorious advance, some obstacles have appeared, disrupting our direction of struggle and affecting our revolutionary great unity. When the service team of the Dongfanghong Commune proposed to achieve revolutionary great unity in the midst of revolutionary great criticism, some comrades were unwilling to unite according to administrative teams, fearing that the reputation of their own fighting squads would be diminished. Because of these selfish thoughts, it not only affected revolutionary great unity but also weakened the fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

To conduct revolutionary great criticism well, we must solve these problems. Under the guidance and help of the PLA comrades, we have conducted extensive ideological education among the Dongfanghong warriors, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of revolutionary great unity. This has enabled everyone to recognize that anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, regardless of where it comes from, we should discard, oppose, and resolutely resist. In this way, on the basis of raising awareness, we have removed ideological obstacles in the revolutionary great criticism and achieved revolutionary great unity.

For those who have been deceived, we have done painstaking and meticulous ideological work. When they were used and deceived by a handful of bad leaders and wrongly left their production posts, we adopted an attitude of patient help, making these comrades understand that our fundamental interests as workers are the same, and our common enemy is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Under the appeal of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the deceived masses have awakened and have even turned against their deceivers, exposing the ugly faces of the handful of bad leaders.

Now, our Dongfanghong Automobile Factory presents a great situation of revolutionary great criticism. Criticism columns stand along both sides of the roads, and revolutionary big-character posters, like bullets, are aimed at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The warriors of the fighting squads, who have united according to their teams, are charging forward on the battlefield of revolutionary great criticism.

    姚文元同志的《评陶铸的两本书》一文的发表，吹响了革命大批判的新的进军号角。
    一年多来，我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，雄辩地证明了，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席所制定的伟大战略部署，最科学地反映了阶级斗争的客观规律，是我们取得无产阶级文化大革命胜利的根本保证。
    现在，我们东方红公社的战士正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在全厂掀起一个革命的大批判的高潮，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了系统的批判，同时和本单位的斗批改紧密地结合起来。
    但是，在我们胜利前进的道路上，也出现了一些障碍，扰乱着我们的斗争大方向，影响着我们的革命的大联合。当东方红公社勤务组提出，要在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合的时候，有的同志不愿意按行政班组联合，怕自己战斗队的名气没有了。因为有这些私心杂念作祟，既影响了革命的大联合，也减弱了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的猛烈进攻的火力。
    要搞好革命大批判，必须解决这些问题。我们在解放军同志的指导和帮助下，对东方红战士普遍进行了思想教育工作，反复强调革命大联合的重要的意义。使大家认识到，凡是不符合毛主席伟大战略部署的东西，不管来自哪一方面，我们都应该丢掉，都应该反对，都应该坚决抵制。这样，在提高认识的基础上，在革命的大批判中，就扫除了思想障碍，实现了革命的大联合。
    对于受蒙蔽的同志，我们做了艰苦细致的思想工作。当他们受一小撮坏头头的利用和蒙蔽，错误地脱离了生产岗位的时候，我们采取了耐心帮助的态度，使这些同志明白我们工人的根本利益是一致的，我们共同的敌人是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的感召下，受蒙蔽的群众觉悟了，并且还反戈一击，揭发了一小撮坏头头的丑恶面目。
    现在，我们东方红汽车制造厂呈现出一派革命大批判的大好形势。大批判专栏林立在马路两旁，一张张革命的大字报，象一颗颗子弹射向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的胸膛。按班组联合起来的战斗队的战士们，正跃马横刀冲杀在革命的大批判的战场上。
