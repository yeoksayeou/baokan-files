Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a new high tide of revolutionary criticism sweeps across the region. The military and people of Central-South China angrily expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary two-faced character, the Khrushchev-style careerist Tao Zhu. Schools, offices, factories, and rural areas are holding criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, and setting up special columns for criticism. The military and people are determined to thoroughly criticize and expose Tao Zhu and his henchman Wang Renzhong, who have faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, aiming to restore capitalism. They vow to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in the Central-South region have drawn immense inspiration and new fighting strength from Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "Criticizing Tao Zhu's Two Books." In recent days, a new high tide of revolutionary criticism has emerged in the Central-South region. The broad masses of military and people are denouncing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary two-faced character, the "South Tyrant" Tao Zhu, and his henchmen like Wang Renzhong, who have long faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev in the Central-South region, aiming to restore capitalism. They unanimously declare: We must more firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and resolutely criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as their agents in the Central-South region, politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must achieve new victories in the great struggle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

In recent days, Wuhan's three towns have presented a thriving scene of revolutionary criticism. Various units are holding criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, and symposiums. Big-character posters are springing up like mushrooms after rain, attracting tens of thousands of people. Schools, offices, factories, rural areas, and alleys are all battlefields of revolutionary criticism; from the Red Guards to revolutionary cadres, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, everyone is striving to be a pioneer in revolutionary criticism. The soldiers and officers of the Wuhan Garrison have, with a large amount of facts, exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionists Tao Zhu and Wang Renzhong and their collusion in attempting to turn the Central-South region into an important base for the restoration of capitalism. They firmly declare: We must use Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to unify our thoughts and actions, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, advance victoriously, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. The old workers of the Hubei Diesel Engine Factory have, with their personal experiences, denounced Tao Zhu's reactionary fallacies such as "China's past hundred-plus years of history are all about being beaten, the reason being that we did not have industry ourselves." Machinist Wu Xubin said: "In the old society, workers were oppressed and bullied. My father was once beaten half to death by the Japanese devils. Why? Because the power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese invaders and traitors." Old machinist Mao Jinlou, who had suffered from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, said with deep feeling: "Unless we overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, even if the factory is run very large, workers will not be able to live a good life." The Red Guards said, the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu has been advocating the path of individualism to the youth, spreading bourgeois ideas, aiming to drag the youth into the mire of individualism and pull socialist China backward. This is absolutely not allowed. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era. Realizing communism throughout the world is our lifelong mission and our greatest ideal. Let Tao Zhu's old rightist advocacy of hedonism, fame, and fortune... all go to hell!

The basic organizations of the "Erqi Commune" in Henan, including Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and the proletarian revolutionaries of Kaifeng's "August 24th," together with the local People's Liberation Army, held meetings and set up special columns for criticism, exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu. They revealed that in 1962, when imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries launched an anti-China chorus, ghosts and monsters came out, and a capitalist restoration gale blew, Tao Zhu, this counter-revolutionary two-faced character, personally went to Henan, toured the eastern part of Henan, and upon returning to Zhengzhou, spread poison and blew a "single farming" wind, proposing the so-called "six restorations" black program for the restoration of capitalism, loudly advocating for individual farming in mountainous areas, "lending" collective farmland to farmers, and mainly developing trees individually, and so on. In short, what Tao Zhu thought, said, and did was to restore capitalism. They said, the people of Henan, like the people of other provinces in Central-South China, were directly and severely harmed by Tao Zhu. We must thoroughly fight him down and expose his poison in Henan!

Li Yuan, the head of the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Hunan Province and a responsible person of the 69000th Unit, said, Tao Zhu, this "South Tyrant," used his usurped position to collude with a handful of power-holders within the Hunan Party who are taking the capitalist road, actively promoting the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, causing serious damage to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Hunan Province. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he also sat in Beijing, remotely controlling Hunan, supporting and shielding a handful of power-holders within the Hunan Party who are taking the capitalist road, creating white terror, and suppressing the revolutionary mass movement. Tao Zhu's heinous crimes in Hunan must be thoroughly settled. The proletarian revolutionary fighters of the Hunan Provincial Committee angrily said, Tao Zhu not only instructed a handful of power-holders within the Hunan Party who are taking the capitalist road to promote many reactionary revisionist black goods such as the "three autonomies and one contract" and the "production responsibility system," destroying the socialist education movement, but also personally came to Hunan many times to spread poison. His account is not to be evaded, and his counter-revolutionary conspiracy will never succeed.

The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the Guangzhou region have long been exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes committed by Tao Zhu. After the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary youngsters, and revolutionary masses were greatly inspired. They said, Tao Zhu, this evil-doing Khrushchev-style careerist, has been exposed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and his counter-revolutionary two-faced ugly face has been exposed in broad daylight. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses declared that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the "South Tyrant" Tao Zhu, making them never be able to rise again!

The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and garrison soldiers and officers in Nanning, Guangxi, held a rally and demonstration in the rain on the morning of the 11th. People held high the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted "Down with the South Tyrant Tao Zhu!" over and over again. Representatives speaking at the rally denounced Tao Zhu's heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought from various aspects. The representatives said, Tao Zhu, this jumping jack on the historical stage, wearing the mask of an "old revolutionary" and the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, has been deceiving people everywhere, faithfully serving as an agent of the bourgeoisie, madly opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought, committing countless crimes. We warn the "South Tyrant" Tao Zhu, the sea may dry up, and the stones may rot, but our loyalty to Chairman Mao will never change! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end with them!

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署掀起革命大批判新高潮
    中南军民愤怒揭发批判“南霸天”陶铸
    学校、机关、工厂、农村，纷纷举行批判会、控诉会，办起大批判专栏，军民决心把反革命两面派、赫鲁晓夫式的野心家陶铸彻底批倒批臭，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部
    据新华社十二日讯　中南地区广大无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，从姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》中获得了巨大的鼓舞和新的战斗力量。连日来，中南地区出现了革命大批判的新高潮，广大军民口诛笔伐，愤怒地揭发和批判反革命两面派、“南霸天”陶铸及其心腹王任重之流长期来在中南地区忠实执行以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线、复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们一致表示：要更坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，坚决把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在中南地区的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭，在彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗中立新功。
    近几天来，武汉三镇呈现一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命大批判的大好形势。各单位纷纷召开批判会、控诉会、座谈会，大字报专栏象雨后春笋般地建立起来，吸引着成千上万的群众。学校、机关、工厂、农村和街道里巷，到处是革命大批判的战场；从红卫兵小将到革命干部、革命工人、革命的贫下中农，人人争做大批判的先锋。武汉警备区广大指战员以大量事实，揭发和批判了反革命修正主义分子陶铸、王任重之流互相勾结，妄图把中南地区变成资本主义复辟的重要基地的滔天罪行。他们坚决表示：一定要用毛主席的伟大战略部署来统一思想，统一行动，高举革命大批判的旗帜，乘胜前进，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。湖北柴油机厂革命派老工人，以亲身经历痛斥了陶铸的所谓“中国过去一百多年的历史，尽是挨打的历史，原因就是自己没有工业”等反动谬论。钳工吴绪斌说：“在旧社会，工人受压迫受欺侮，我父亲就曾经被日本鬼子打得死去活来，为什么？就是因为权掌握在蒋介石和日本侵略者、汉奸手里。”受到资产阶级反动路线迫害的老钳工毛金楼深有体会地说：“不把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打倒，不树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，工厂办得再大，工人也莫想过好日子。”红卫兵革命小将说，反革命两面派陶铸一直向青年鼓吹个人主义道路，宣扬资产阶级的思想，就是要把青年拖向个人主义的泥坑，把社会主义中国拉向后退，这万万办不到。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，在全世界实现共产主义是我们毕生的战斗任务，也是我们最大的理想。让陶铸这个老右派所宣扬的享乐主义的理想、成名成家的理想……，统统见鬼去吧！
    河南“二七公社”所属郑州、洛阳、开封等地的基层组织和开封“八二四”的无产阶级革命派，同当地人民解放军一起，举行集会、办大批判专栏，揭发和批判反革命两面派陶铸。他们揭露说，一九六二年，正当帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派掀起反华大合唱，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，刮起一股资本主义复辟妖风的时候，陶铸这个反革命两面派亲自出马，来到河南，去豫东地区绕了一圈，回到郑州就大肆放毒，刮起了一股“单干风”，提出了所谓“六恢复”的复辟资本主义的黑纲领，大肆叫嚷山区包产到户，把集体耕地“借”给农民，发展树木以个体为主，等等。一句话，陶铸所想的所说的所干的就是复辟资本主义。他们说，河南人民同中南其他各省人民一样，受陶铸的毒害最直接最厉害，我们一定要把这个反革命两面派彻底斗倒斗臭，肃清他在河南的流毒！
    湖南省革命委员会筹备小组组长、六九○○部队负责人黎源说，陶铸这个“南霸天”利用他所窃踞的要职，勾结湖南省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，积极推行中国赫鲁晓夫的一套修正主义路线，使湖南省社会主义革命和社会主义建设遭到严重的破坏。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他又坐在北京，遥控湖南，支持和包庇湖南省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，制造白色恐怖，镇压革命群众运动。陶铸在湖南犯下的滔天罪行，一定要彻底清算。湖南省委机关无产阶级革命派战士愤怒地说，陶铸不仅指使湖南省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，推行“三自一包”、“产量责任制”等许多反革命修正主义黑货，破坏社会主义教育运动，还多次亲自来湖南放毒。他的这笔账是赖不掉的，他的反革命阴谋也是永远不能得逞的。
    广州地区的无产阶级革命派和革命群众对陶铸所犯下的滔天罪行恨之入骨，早就展开了揭发批判活动。姚文元同志的重要文章发表以后，广大无产阶级革命派、革命小将和革命群众无限振奋。他们说，陶铸这个作恶多端的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家在无产阶级文化大革命中被揪出来了，他的反革命两面派的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。广大革命群众表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握革命斗争的大方向，把中国赫鲁晓夫和“南霸天”陶铸彻底批倒批臭，使他们永世不得翻身！
    广西南宁的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和驻军指战员，十一日上午冒雨举行了大会和示威游行。人们高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，挥舞着红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“打倒南霸天陶铸！”在大会上发言的代表从各方面愤怒揭发了陶铸反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。代表们说，陶铸这个在历史舞台上耍尽花招的跳梁小丑，带着“老革命”的脸谱，披着马列主义的外衣，到处招摇撞骗，忠实地充当资产阶级的代理人，疯狂地反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，罪行累累。我们正告“南霸天”陶铸，海可枯，石可烂，我们忠于毛主席的心永不变！谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就和他坚决拚到底！
