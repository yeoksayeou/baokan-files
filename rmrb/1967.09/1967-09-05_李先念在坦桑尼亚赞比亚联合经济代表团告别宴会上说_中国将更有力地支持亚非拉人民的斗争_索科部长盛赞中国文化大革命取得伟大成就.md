Li Xiannian, at the farewell banquet for the Tanzanian-Zambian Joint Economic Delegation, said that China will more powerfully support the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Minister Sokko praised the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, September 4th: Zambian Minister of State Sokko said at the farewell banquet held by the Tanzanian-Zambian Joint Economic Delegation in Beijing tonight, "We wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China victory, because your achievements are our achievements, and they are also the achievements of all peace-loving people in the world. To lead the Chinese people to continue advancing and thereby add strength to the cause of human progress, we wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Minister Sokko spoke in his own name and on behalf of the other leader of the joint economic delegation, Tanzanian Minister of Finance Jamal.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian and relevant officials from our country were invited to attend this farewell banquet.

Minister Sokko said in his speech, "We are very proud to be able to come to your great country during the high tide of your Cultural Revolution. Wherever we went, we saw a vibrant revolutionary scene. From what we have seen, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought great achievements to the Chinese people and the people of the world in all fields. These achievements have left an indelible impression on us and are a source of inspiration for the people."

He enthusiastically pointed out in his speech that the friendship between the peoples of Zambia, Tanzania, and China is growing stronger day by day. He also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their assistance in their economic construction. He said, "The unity and strength of the People's Republic of China are very important for the revolutionary progress of developing countries like us and for world peace."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said in his speech that he hoped the delegation would take the fighting friendship of the 700 million Chinese people to the hardworking and brave people of Tanzania and Zambia. He said, "Through our sincere and friendly discussions, we have exchanged views on relevant issues regarding further strengthening the friendly relations and economic and technological cooperation between China, Tanzania, and Zambia, deepened our mutual understanding, and reached a consensus. All of this fully reflects the deep friendship of mutual support and cooperation among the peoples of China, Tanzania, and Zambia in their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles and their efforts to build their own countries."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, "We are very grateful to Minister Jamal and Minister Sokko and all the friends in the delegation for their evaluation of the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the achievements of our socialist economic construction, and the economic and technological aid from China. The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao that 'the people who have already won the revolution should support the struggles of those who are still fighting for liberation' and 'China should make greater contributions to humanity,' are honored to be able to make some contributions to the cause of developing independent and self-reliant national economies for the people of Tanzania and Zambia. Through this great proletarian cultural revolution that has shaken the world, China will be even more prosperous. All the people of China resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to 'grasp revolution, promote production' and will definitely make greater internationalist contributions and more powerfully support the just struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and against imperialism and colonialism."

He said, "Currently, imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism are stirring up an anti-China wave. They will definitely try to sabotage the friendly relations that already exist and are developing between the governments and peoples of China, Tanzania, and Zambia. Under these circumstances, the strengthening of friendly relations between the Chinese people and the peoples of Tanzania and Zambia is a heavy blow to our common enemy—imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism."

The Tanzanian Ambassador to China, Mwaluko, and envoys from other African countries to China also attended the banquet.

    新华社四日讯　赞比亚国务部长索科，今晚在坦桑尼亚、赞比亚联合经济代表团在北京举行的告别宴会上说，我们祝愿中国文化大革命获得胜利，因为你们的成就，就是我们的成就，也是世界一切爱好和平人民的成就。为了领导中国人民不断前进，从而给人类进步事业普遍增添力量，我们祝愿伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    索科部长是以他的名义，并代表联合经济代表团的另一位领导人、坦桑尼亚财政部长贾马勒讲这些话的。
    李先念副总理和我国各有关方面的负责人，应邀出席了这个告别宴会。
    索科部长在讲话中说，我们代表团能在你们文化大革命的高潮中，来到你们伟大的国家，感到十分骄傲。我们所到之处，都看到了生气勃勃的革命景象。就我们所见，中国文化大革命在各个领域为中国人民和世界人民带来了很大成就。这些成就给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象，是给人们带来鼓舞的源泉。
    他在讲话中热情地指出，赞比亚、坦桑尼亚和中国三国人民之间的友谊正在日益加强，他并且表示感谢中国政府和人民对他们经济建设的援助。他说，坦桑尼亚、赞比亚人民相信，中华人民共和国的团结和力量，对于象我们这样的发展中的国家的革命进步，对世界和平，都是十分重要的。
    李先念副总理在讲话中请代表团把七亿中国人民的战斗友谊，带给勤劳勇敢的坦桑尼亚人民和赞比亚人民。他说，我们双方这次通过诚挚友好的会谈，就进一步加强中国、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚三国友好关系和经济技术合作的有关问题，交换了意见，加深了相互了解，取得了一致的看法。所有这一切，充分体现了中国、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚三国人民在反帝反殖斗争和努力建设各自国家的崇高事业中互相支持、友好合作的深厚友谊。
    李先念副总理说，我们很感谢贾马勒部长和索科部长以及代表团全体朋友对我国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，对我国社会主义经济建设的成就，对中国的经济技术援助所给予的评价。中国人民遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席关于“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”和“中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献”的教导，能够在坦桑尼亚人民和赞比亚人民发展独立自主的民族经济的事业中作出一点贡献，感到十分光荣。经过我国这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，中国将更加欣欣向荣，全中国人民坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一定能够作出更大的国际主义贡献，一定能够更有力地支持亚、非、拉美各国人民争取和维护民族独立和反帝反殖的正义斗争。
    他说，当前，帝国主义、新老殖民主义、现代修正主义正在掀起一个反华浪潮，他们也一定会对中国、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚三国政府和人民之间已经存在的并且正在发展的友好关系进行破坏。在这种情况下，中国人民和坦桑尼亚、赞比亚两国人民的友好关系的加强，就是对我们的共同的敌人——帝国主义、新老殖民主义、现代修正主义的沉重打击。
    坦桑尼亚驻中国大使姆瓦卢科和非洲国家驻中国的使节，也出席了宴会。
