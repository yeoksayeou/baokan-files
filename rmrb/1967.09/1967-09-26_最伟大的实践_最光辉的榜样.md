The greatest practice and the most brilliant example

The entire personnel of the air force unit that shot down the U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek

Chairman Mao, our most beloved and great commander-in-chief! With unparalleled greatness, you personally led and initiated the world-shaking, fate-of-mankind-determining, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. You created a brilliant example of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and achieved great victories. Now, amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity, to further advance the proletarian cultural revolution, you, despite all hardships, have gone deep into the masses to conduct meticulous investigations and research. This is your greatest revolutionary practice, setting the most brilliant example for us to fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses!

Chairman Mao, your great action is like a strong east wind, blowing through every place; like a dazzling beacon, guiding the actions of hundreds of millions of people. The proletarian cultural revolution will surely usher in another new high tide. In this new situation, we will definitely follow your great strategic deployment, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate our firepower, focus our targets, thoroughly smash the headquarters of the bourgeoisie, and completely criticize, expose, and overthrow China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically! We will make sure he never rises again!

We will definitely follow your call to "grasp revolution, promote preparedness for war," strengthen our preparedness, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and be ready at any time to annihilate all invading enemies and suppress the activities of local landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and U.S.-Chiang spies. We vow to create new merits for the people!
