"In the frost of a thousand trees, red flowers bloom brilliantly. The sky is filled with the anger of the heavenly soldiers." A campaign to criticize the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is sweeping through the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province like a storm. Whether in the mountains, forests, or along the rivers, revolutionary criticism battlefields are set up everywhere. The vast majority of peasants in the province have formed a mighty revolutionary army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united in hatred of the enemy, and with high morale, they are thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses

Mao Zedong Thought is the guide and weapon for this criticism campaign. Revolutionary cadres in the campaign use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, mobilizing the masses to join this great "people's war."

At the beginning, some masses did not fully understand the great significance of this criticism campaign, thinking it was "the cadres' business, intellectuals' business," "too busy with production to engage in it," or "China's Khrushchev has already been overthrown, why criticize further?" To address these active thoughts, various places widely carried out extensive study, discussion, propaganda, and mobilization. First, they organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve the masses' ideological and cognitive problems. For example, after studying Chairman Mao's teaching, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution," the masses recognized that China's Khrushchev is the most dangerous enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat; after studying Chairman Mao's teaching, "The main force in the countryside that has been fighting hard for a long time is the poor peasants," "Without poor peasants, there is no revolution," the poor and lower-middle peasants realized that they are the main force in this criticism campaign; after studying Chairman Mao's teaching, "Carry the revolution through to the end," everyone realized that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are like poisonous snakes, "Although they have felt the threat of winter, they have not yet frozen stiff," and they must be thoroughly criticized politically, ideologically, and theoretically. After repeated study, the masses' ideological problems were resolved, and they actively joined the battle. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Bayan County discussed the following questions during their study: "Why launch a mass criticism campaign?" "Is overthrowing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party organizationally equivalent to overthrowing them politically and ideologically?" "How can we overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically?" Through discussion, they realized that whether or not to carry out revolutionary criticism is a major issue concerning whether the proletariat's helm can be kept and is a major issue concerning the future of the country and the world revolution. Only by carrying out revolutionary criticism well, thoroughly overthrowing and exposing China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, and eliminating their poison, can the restoration of capitalism be prevented.

In this revolutionary criticism campaign, the rural areas of Heilongjiang also focused on class education and carried out activities to recall and compare. For example, recalling bitterness and sweetness to conduct education comparing the old and new societies; recalling the history of cooperation and people's communes to conduct education comparing the two roads; recalling the history of class struggle since liberation to conduct education comparing power and loss of power; recalling the history of Chairman Mao's guidance of the democratic revolution and socialist revolution to conduct education comparing the two lines. Through these educations, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and intense hatred for China's Khrushchev. Many communes and production teams simultaneously enthusiastically carried out activities to praise Chairman Mao's great achievements. The more they praised Chairman Mao, the more they loved Chairman Mao, the more they loved Mao Zedong Thought, the more they loved socialism, and the more resolutely they wanted to follow Chairman Mao forever and resolutely take the socialist road.

Achieving great unity in the criticism campaign, uniting to carry out mass criticism

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Heilongjiang Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions, strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions and clarified friends and enemies. Everyone concentrated their hatred on China's Khrushchev, directing their fire at him, hating him, settling accounts with him, and digging up his roots. In this way, they firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Before the criticism campaign in Lindian County, only 25% of the revolutionary mass organizations had united. After the criticism campaign deepened, "internal wars" gradually stopped, and more than 90% of the mass organizations united. Before the criticism campaign in Huojian Commune of Wangkui County, there were two or three mass organizations in each of the ten production brigades, opposing each other. Through the criticism campaign, they found the root of their differences, mainly influenced by China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few," having different opinions about some cadres, with one side insisting on overthrowing and the other side helping them stand up. Through studying Chairman Mao's cadre policy, presenting facts, and reasoning, they conducted a comprehensive class analysis of the cadres, gradually unifying their understanding and eliminating differences. Now, all ten production brigades have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

Mass criticism is closely linked with struggle, criticism, and transformation; struggle, criticism, and transformation vigorously promote mass criticism

For many years, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, have had a very bad influence among the masses. Although their power has been seized organizationally, they still have command politically and ideologically. To thoroughly seize this command, it is necessary to link mass criticism with the class struggle in the local area and unit, carrying out mass exposure and criticism to eliminate their poison among the masses.

At the beginning of the criticism campaign, there was a thought among the commune members that "it has nothing to do with our local area," and the criticism could not deepen. Later, everyone focused on the main points of China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside, compared them with local realities, and found many problems. These problems were combed into braids and matched with China's Khrushchev's fallacies one by one, clearly proving that China's Khrushchev is the mastermind behind the restoration of capitalism. For example, in Decheng Commune of Yian County, the following issues were investigated: the phenomenon of relaxing supervision and reform of landlords and rich peasants was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "the extinction of class struggle"; the production teams were divided smaller and smaller, directly related to his fallacy of advocating "contracting to households" and "individual farming"; bonus points, full-attendance rewards, etc., were exactly the poison of "money as the commander" and "material incentives" ... In this way, the class struggle reality in the local area was linked with China's Khrushchev's crimes. The broad masses saw, touched, and deeply felt China's Khrushchev's evil deeds, arousing deep hatred for him.

After exposing the cover and investigating the poison, it is necessary to criticize. How to criticize? The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, took the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party as live targets, using the method of "study, present, criticize" to thoroughly criticize and expose revisionist fallacies, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. They used Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat as a weapon, through presenting the facts of local class struggle, criticized the fallacy of "the extinction of class struggle"; used Chairman Mao's theory of cooperation and commune as a weapon, through presenting the advantages of collective economy and the harm of individual economy, criticized the fallacies of "developing the rich peasant economy" and "four freedoms, three selfs, and one contract"; used Chairman Mao's theory of class exploitation and class oppression as a weapon, through presenting the sweetness of the new society and the bitterness of the old society, criticized the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "welcome exploitation"; used Chairman Mao's theory of the Communist Party as the vanguard of the proletariat as a weapon, through presenting the harm of the peaceful evolution of party members, criticized the fallacy of "there is no fear of having ten thousand rich peasant party members in Northeast China." In this way, through repeated study, repeated criticism, and repeated reasoning, the broad masses saw the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines more clearly, their determination to criticize and expose was greater, their confidence to establish was stronger, their criticism of revisionist fallacies was more thorough, and Mao Zedong Thought was more firmly established.

In the process of "study, present, criticize," there was once a problem of who the criticism was directed at. Some commune members said that the past affairs were done under the leadership of brigade and team cadres, and county and commune cadres commanded them to do it, so the accounts should also be settled with the county, commune, and brigade cadres. Some masses were afraid of being "sifted layer by layer" and eventually burning themselves. To address this situation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants adopted the method of "investigating the poison from top to bottom and digging up the roots from bottom to top, directing the fire upwards, digging up the roots upwards, and settling accounts upwards." Everyone realized that the ringleader is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, the fire should be directed at him, the roots should be dug up from him, and the total accounts should be settled with him!

Putting the public first, daring to lead and participate in the criticism campaign

Chairman Mao pointed out: "It is extremely important for the committees of the Party at all levels to do their leadership work well." The practice of rural revolutionary criticism proves: it is extremely important for the revolutionary leading cadres at all levels to do a good job in leading the criticism campaign to promote the criticism campaign extensively and deeply.

To lead the criticism campaign well, the leading cadres must first solve their own understanding of the criticism campaign. Some revolutionary leading cadres were afraid that the criticism campaign would involve themselves; some revolutionary leading cadres were afraid that the criticism campaign would "drag" the masses and make them commit line errors again; some leading cadres of revolutionary mass organizations participating in the leadership were eager to fight "internal wars" and neglected to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. These are all the result of the private character in their minds. Through repeated study of the "Old Three Articles," everyone realized that they must thoroughly criticize and expose the private character and firmly establish the public character. With the private character gone and the public character in mind, there is no fear in action, and there is daring to lead the criticism campaign.

Are revolutionary leading cadres standing above the masses, pointing fingers, and issuing orders? Or are they "going among the masses and staying with the masses" to participate in and promote the criticism campaign? This is the key to whether they can lead the criticism campaign well. Many revolutionary leading cadres in the rural areas of Heilongjiang seriously followed Chairman Mao's instructions on the mass line. They were both students and teachers of the masses, constantly learning from the masses and constantly propagating, organizing, and summarizing the masses' experiences, promoting the criticism campaign. Led by the leading comrades of the Bayan County Revolutionary Committee, more than five hundred Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team members were sent to the countryside in succession, joining the front line of the criticism campaign with the masses, studying together, laboring together, and criticizing together, playing a very good role.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Heilongjiang Province, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and successfully carried out the rural criticism campaign. The revolutionary criticism campaign, in turn, greatly promoted the new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, becoming a great movement to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 以毛泽东思想为武器开展群众性大批判　黑龙江省广大农村万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫

    以毛泽东思想为武器开展群众性大批判
　　黑龙江省广大农村万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫
    “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”一场围剿党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，正以暴风骤雨之势，在黑龙江省农村迅猛开展。无论是山村、林区、江滨，到处都摆下了革命大批判的战场。全省广大农民组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同仇敌忾，斗志昂扬，正在从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭。
　　用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众
    毛泽东思想是这场大批判的指南和武器。广大革命干部在大批判中用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，放手发动群众投入这场伟大的“人民战争”。
    开始，有些群众对这场大批判的伟大意义认识不足，认为这是“干部的事，知识分子的事”，“生产忙，没时间搞”，“已经把中国赫鲁晓夫拉下了马，还批判啥？”针对这些活思想，各地普遍开展了大学习、大讨论、大宣传、大发动，首先组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，有的放矢地用毛泽东思想去解决群众中的思想认识问题。例如：学习了毛主席的“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，群众就认清了中国的赫鲁晓夫是无产阶级专政最危险的敌人；学习了毛主席的“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”，“没有贫农，便没有革命”的教导，贫下中农认识到自己是这场大批判的主力军；学习了毛主席的“将革命进行到底”的教导，大家认识到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派象毒蛇一样，“虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢”，必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深、批透、批倒、批臭。经过反复学习，群众的思想问题迎刃而解，积极投入战斗。巴彦县的贫下中农和革命干部在学习中讨论了这样一些问题：“为什么要开展大批判？”“对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从组织上夺了权，是否就等于从思想上、政治上打倒了？”“怎样才能从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、斗臭，彻底打倒？”经过讨论，他们认识到搞不搞革命的大批判，这是关系到能不能保住无产阶级印把子的大事，是关系到国家前途和世界革命的大事。只有搞好革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙彻底批倒批臭，肃清他们的流毒，才能防止资本主义复辟。
    在这场革命的大批判中，黑龙江农村还狠抓阶级教育，开展回忆对比活动。如：忆苦思甜，进行新旧社会对比教育；忆合作化和人民公社化史，进行两条道路对比教育；忆解放以来阶级斗争史，进行掌权和失权对比教育；忆毛主席指导民主革命和社会主义革命的历史，进行两条路线对比教育。通过这些教育，广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对中国的赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨。许多社、队同时热烈地开展了颂扬毛主席的丰功伟绩的活动。大家越颂扬毛主席，越热爱毛主席，越热爱毛泽东思想，越热爱社会主义，更加坚决地要永远跟着毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路。
　　在大批判中实现大联合，联合起来进行大批判
    黑龙江省广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌友我。大家把千仇万恨，集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫身上，火往他身上烧，恨往他身上引，账往他身上算，根往他身上挖。这样，就紧紧掌握了斗争大方向，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。林甸县开展大批判之前，联合起来的革命群众组织只有百分之二十五。大批判深入开展之后，“内战”逐渐停止，百分之九十以上的群众组织都联合了起来。望奎县火箭公社十个大队，在大批判之前都有两、三个群众组织，互相对立。通过大批判，他们找到了分歧的根源，主要是受了中国赫鲁晓夫的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的影响，对某些干部的看法不一致，这一派要坚持打倒，那一派要帮他站起来。通过学习毛主席的干部政策，摆事实，讲道理，对干部作了全面的阶级分析，两派之间逐步统一了认识，消除了分歧。现在十个大队全部实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
　　大批判紧密结合斗批改　斗批改大力推进大批判
    多少年来，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，打着“红旗”反红旗，在群众中散布了极坏的影响。虽然从组织上夺他们的权，但是他们在政治上、思想上还有指挥权。要彻底夺取这个指挥权，必须把大批判与本地区、本单位的阶级斗争紧密结合起来，开展群众性的大揭露、大批判，肃清他们在群众中的流毒。
    大批判开始时，社员群众中有“与本地无关”的思想，批判深入不下去。后来，大家抓住中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图在农村复辟资本主义的几个主要论点，对照本地实际，查出许多问题。把这些问题，梳成辫子，与中国的赫鲁晓夫的谬论逐条对号，就清楚地证明中国的赫鲁晓夫是复辟资本主义的总后台。例如依安县德胜公社保安大队，就清查出：放松对地主、富农监督改造的阶级混乱现象，是受了中国的赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭论”的毒害；生产队越分越小，同他鼓吹“包产到户”、“单干”的谬论直接有关；加工分、满勤奖等等，正是“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”的流毒……。这样一来，就把本地区的阶级斗争实际与中国赫鲁晓夫的罪状挂上了钩。广大群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶就看得见、摸得着、体会得深切，从而激起了对他的深仇大恨。
    揭开盖子，查出流毒，就要批判。怎样批判呢？广大贫下中农以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为活靶子，运用“学、摆、批”的办法，大破修正主义谬论，大立毛泽东思想。他们以毛主席关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的理论为武器，通过摆本地阶级斗争的事实，批判“阶级斗争熄灭论”；以毛主席关于合作化、公社化的理论为武器，通过摆集体经济的好处和个体经济的危害，批判“发展富农经济”和“四大自由”、“三自一包”的谬论；以毛主席关于阶级剥削和阶级压迫的理论为武器，通过摆新社会的甜和旧社会的苦，批判“剥削有功”、“欢迎剥削”的谬论；以毛主席关于共产党是无产阶级先锋队的理论为武器，通过摆党员和平演变的危害，批判“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”的谬论。这样反复学习、反复批判、反复讲道理，广大群众对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争就看得越清楚，破的决心越大，立的信心越强，批判修正主义谬论就越彻底，毛泽东思想就树立得越牢固。
    在“学、摆、批”的过程中，曾经出现过矛头指向谁的问题。有些社员说，过去的事情是大、小队干部领着干的，县、社干部指挥干的，账也要算到县、社、队干部身上。有些群众怕“层层过筛子”，早晚烧到自己头上。针对这种情况，广大贫下中农采取了“由上往下查流毒，由下往上挖毒根”、“火往上引、根往上挖、账往上算”的办法。大家认识到，罪魁祸首是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，烈火要烧到他身上，老根要挖到他身上，总账要算到他身上！
　　公字当头，敢字当头，领导大批判，参加大批判
    毛主席指出：“党的各级委员会把自己的领导工作做好，是极为重要的。”农村革命大批判的实践证明：各级革命的领导班子做好对大批判的领导工作，对广泛地、深入地推进大批判运动，具有极其重要的作用。
    要领导好大批判，领导班子首先要解决自己对大批判的认识问题。曾经有些革命的领导干部怕大批判牵涉到自己；有些革命的领导干部怕大批判“刮拉”着群众，重新犯路线错误；也有的参加领导班子的革命群众组织的负责人，热衷于打“内战”，忽视了紧紧掌握斗争大方向。这些都是头脑里的私字在作怪。通过反复学习“老三篇”，大家认识到，必须大破私字，大立公字。头脑里去了私字，有了公字，行动上便没了怕字，有了敢字，敢于领导大批判。
    革命的领导干部是高踞于群众之上，指手划脚，发号施令？还是“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”，参加大批判，搞好大批判？这是能否领导好大批判的关键。黑龙江农村的许多革命领导干部，都认真地按照毛主席的群众路线的指示办事。他们既做群众的学生，又做群众的先生，不断地向群众学习，又不断地宣传群众，组织群众，总结群众的经验，把大批判运动推向前进。巴彦县以县革命委员会的领导同志为首，先后带领了五百多名毛泽东思想宣传队员，深入农村，杀上大批判的火线，和群众学习在一起，劳动在一起，批判在一起，起了很好的作用。
    黑龙江省广大贫下中农高举革命的批判旗帜，活学活用毛主席著作，胜利地开展了农村大批判运动。革命的大批判运动，又大大地推动了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，成了大树毛泽东思想绝对权威的伟大运动。　（本报记者）
