American monopolistic capital is hastening to control and plunder Indonesia's oil resources, exploiting the Indonesian people to the bone, and turning Indonesia into a base for U.S. imperialism's aggressive wars in Southeast Asia.

Since the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique came to power, in order to please its American masters, it has adopted a series of reactionary measures to sell out national interests. On December 24 last year, its puppet parliament passed a new "Foreign Investment Law," openly throwing the door wide open to foreign capital. On January 3 this year, it announced the lifting of restrictions on companies like Mobil, Standard Oil, Pan American, and Shell; and on July 7, the two governments of the U.S. and Indonesia signed an agreement guaranteeing the safety of U.S. monopolistic capital investments.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, on the one hand, agreed to raise the domestic gasoline prices for foreign oil companies; on the other hand, it also agreed to the demand of the Standard Oil Company to reduce the export price of Indonesian oil by $0.15 per barrel, allowing American oil companies to reap even greater profits. Due to the reduction in oil export prices, Indonesia suffers an annual loss of at least $15 million.

Indonesia is a country rich in oil resources, with estimated reserves exceeding 1.2 billion tons. However, 90% of Indonesia's oil resources are controlled by imperialist countries, with the majority being monopolized by U.S. capital. Before the war, Mobil Oil Company invested $90 million, and now its investment in Indonesia has exceeded $300 million. Standard Oil Company's investment has increased from $100 million pre-war to over $300 million today. The Shell Oil Company, originally a Dutch-British capital, has long been infiltrated by U.S. capital. In the West Irian Dutch New Guinea Oil Company, U.S. capital holds 60%. The total U.S. oil investment in Indonesia has far exceeded $700 million, ranking first among foreign oil investments in Indonesia.

Most of the oil produced in Indonesia is exported by American oil companies to reap huge profits, with only about one-fourth supplied for domestic consumption. As a result, oil-rich Indonesia often faces severe oil shortages, and essential kerosene frequently disappears from the market. The thick oil pipelines of American oil companies, like blood-sucking tubes, penetrate deep into the Indonesian hinterland, sucking oil from hundreds of kilometers away to refineries on the coast, and then shipping it abroad.

The foreign exchange and profits plundered by American oil companies from Indonesia are astonishing. It is revealed that from 1954 to 1961, the capital invested by Shell Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company, and Standard Oil Company was approximately $222 million, while their foreign exchange earnings from oil exports during this period were $2.285 billion, about ten times the total investment during the same period. Foreign oil companies enjoy special privileges, and they can dispose of foreign exchange at will.

In February and March 1965, the previous Indonesian government, under strong pressure from the Indonesian people, was forced to take over American enterprises. However, American oil companies, in collusion with right-wing military cliques, continued to reap huge profits.

American oil monopolies not only plunder Indonesia on a large scale but have long been engaged in subversive activities, openly supporting counter-revolutionary armed rebellions. In 1956, when armed rebellions broke out in Sumatra, Indonesia, American oil capital openly supported them, providing large amounts of money and materials to the rebels. Mobil Oil Company used its planes to transport the rebel leader Sharifuddin from Jakarta to Sumatra; Standard Oil Company used its oil extraction area's dock facilities and ships to help the rebels transport weapons and communicate with the outside world.

Mobil Oil Company has built oil depots in various important ports in Indonesia to supply oil needs in Southeast Asia, especially to support the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. According to officials of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, "the Middle East crisis will not cause a gasoline shortage in South Vietnam," because "the gasoline used in Vietnam comes from Indonesia."

### 美国吸血鬼吸尽印尼石油资源  印尼正沦为美国在东南亚的战争基地

　　美国吸血鬼吸尽印尼石油资源
　　印尼正沦为美国在东南亚的战争基地
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：美国垄断资本正加紧控制和掠夺印尼的石油资源，对印尼人民进行敲骨吸髓的剥削，并把印尼变成美帝国主义在东南亚进行侵略战争的基地。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团上台以来，为了讨好它的美国主子，采取了一系列出卖民族利益的反动措施。去年十二月二十四日，它的御用议会通过了新的“外国投资法案”，公然为外资敞开大门。今年一月三日，它宣布撤销对美孚、德士古、泛美及壳牌等石油公司的管制；七日美印（尼）两国政府又签订一项保证美国垄断资本投资安全的协定。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权一方面答应外国石油公司，提高在印尼国内销售的汽油价格；另一方面又同意德士古石油公司的要求，把印尼石油出口价格每桶降低美元一角五分，使美国石油公司得以牟取更大的利润。由于降低石油出口价格，印尼方面每年至少损失一千五百万美元。
    印尼是一个石油资源丰富的国家，据估计蕴藏量在十二亿吨以上。但是，印尼的石油资源百分之九十控制在帝国主义国家手里，其中绝大部分又为美国资本所垄断。美孚石油公司战前投资九千万美元，目前这个公司在印尼投资已达三亿美元以上。德士古石油公司的投资也由战前的一千万美元增加到目前的三亿多美元。原为荷英资本的壳牌石油公司，早已被美国资本渗入。在西伊里安荷兰新几内亚石油公司中，美国资本占百分之六十。美国在印尼的全部石油投资已大大超过七亿美元，居外国在印尼石油投资的首位。
    印尼所产石油大部分被美国石油公司输往国外牟取暴利，供应印尼国内消费的只占四分之一左右。以至盛产石油的印尼居然常常大闹石油荒，民间必需的煤油也经常从市场上绝迹。而美国石油公司一根根粗大的输油管就象吸血管一样，深入印尼内地，从几百公里远的地方把石油吸到滨海地区的炼油厂，然后一船船地运往国外。
    美国石油公司从印尼掠夺的外汇和利润是十分惊人的。据透露，从一九五四年起的七年中，壳牌石油公司、美孚石油公司和德士古石油公司所投资本约二亿二千二百万美元，而它们在这期间输出石油所得外汇收入是二十二亿八千五百万美元，约为同时期投资总数的十倍。外国石油公司享有特权，它们可以自行支配外汇。
    一九六五年二、三月间，印尼前政府在印尼人民的强烈要求下被迫接管了美国企业，但是美国石油公司勾结右派将领集团仍在攫取巨额利润。
    美石油垄断资本不但在印尼大肆进行掠夺，而且早就从事颠覆活动，公开支持反革命武装叛乱。一九五六年印尼苏门答腊发生武装叛乱时，美国石油资本就公然加以支持，除向叛党提供大量金钱和物资外，美孚石油公司还利用它的飞机运载叛党头子沙佛鲁丁从雅加达逃到苏门答腊；德士古石油公司也利用它的采油区的码头设备和船只帮助叛党运输武器和与外国联系。
    美孚石油公司在印尼各重要港口，均建有油库，供应东南亚区石油需要，特别是供应美国在越南的侵略战争的需要。据南越傀儡政权官员供认：“中东危机不会引起南越的汽油缺乏”，因为“在越南使用的汽油是从印度尼西亚来的”。
