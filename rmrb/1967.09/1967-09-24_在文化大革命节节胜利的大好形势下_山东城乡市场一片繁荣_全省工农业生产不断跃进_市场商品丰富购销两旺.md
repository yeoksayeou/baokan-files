Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and driven by the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the exchange of materials in urban and rural areas of Shandong Province is smooth, with brisk buying and selling and stable prices. From cities like Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo to the vast rural markets, cotton cloth, daily necessities, and various types of goods are abundant, and the supply of pork, mutton, poultry, and eggs is sufficient. The urban and rural markets are bustling with prosperity.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in Shandong Province resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production." They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works diligently, with revolutionary enthusiasm surging, driving industrial and agricultural production to continuously leap forward, creating a solid material foundation for the market. After the summer harvest, the autumn harvest of grain, cotton, tobacco, and hemp is also a bumper year. Industrial production is booming, with the total industrial output value for the first eight months increasing by 12.81% compared to the same period last year. Currently, new cotton and flue-cured tobacco are being harvested in large quantities. By mid-September, the procurement volume of new cotton, hemp, and flue-cured tobacco has all increased significantly compared to the same period last year.

To prepare for the upcoming autumn market boom, the revolutionary workers in the commercial and supply departments of Shandong Province are striving to organize industrial products to go to the countryside. Currently, the daily industrial products sent to the countryside have increased by 20% to 50% compared to the same period last year. Agricultural machinery, rubber-wheeled carts, fertilizers, and small agricultural tools, and other means of production are also being continuously transported to the countryside. This year, due to the production of a batch of small fertilizer plants within the province, the sales volume of fertilizers from January to August has increased by 25% compared to the same period last year. The industrial sector's broad revolutionary masses have firmly established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and wholeheartedly serving the broad masses of peasants, sparing no effort to produce durable, beautiful, and inexpensive products to supply the countryside. Cotton mills have increased the production of various types of thick, wide, and low-priced coarse cloth. Knitting factories have this year designed and produced various types of towels for rural use. These economical and practical products are deeply loved by the broad masses of rural community members. From January to August, the total sales volume of various commodities in the province has all increased compared to the same period last year, with a significant increase in the sales volume of daily necessities for the people. The thriving market scene in urban and rural areas of Shandong Province is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful result of the Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses on the commercial and supply front in Shandong Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and exposing the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the commercial front. They thoroughly exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's financial and economic work policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and the great strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." During the Cultural Revolution, they, together with the Red Guards, broke with the old and established the new, emphasizing proletarian politics, and made the urban and rural markets take on a new look. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers on the commercial front truly realized that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that the countryside is the main body of the industrial market. With deep class feelings, they went deep into the countryside, understood the needs of the peasants, and genuinely did their best to produce and supply the commodities needed by the rural market, prioritizing the arrangement and supply of these commodities to wholeheartedly serve the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Through the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers on the commercial front also criticized the narrow-minded localism that only considered the interests of their own units and established the global perspective of serving the development of the socialist economy. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses on the commercial front also severely criticized the crimes of "three autonomies and one contract" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong, strengthened proletarian dictatorship, severely cracked down on speculation, and consolidated and developed the socialist commercial front.

    新华社济南二十二日电　在光焰无际的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的推动下，山东省城乡物资交流畅通，购销两旺，物价稳定。从济南、青岛、淄博等城市到广大农村市场，棉布、日用百货花色品种齐全，猪肉、羊肉、禽、蛋等副食品供应充分，城乡市场一片欣欣向荣。

    为迎接即将到来的秋后旺季市场，山东省商业、供销部门的革命职工正在努力组织工业品下乡。目前已下到农村的日用工业品，比去年同期增加二成至五成。农业机械、胶轮马车、化肥、小农具等生产资料，也源源运往农村。今年由于省内一批小化肥厂投产，一至八月份，化肥销售量比去年同期增加百分之二十五。工业部门广大革命职工，坚定地树立了以农业为基础，全心全意为广大农民服务的思想，千方百计生产坚固耐用、物美价廉的产品供应农村。棉纺织厂大力增产了各种质地厚实、幅面宽、价钱低的粗布。针织品厂今年新设计和生产了各种花色品种的农村用的毛巾。这些经济实惠的产品，深受广大农村社员的喜爱。一至八月份，全省各类商品购销总值都比去年同期有所增长，人民日常生活用品的销售量有较大幅度的增加。山东城乡市场一片繁荣景象，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    山东省商业、供销战线上的广大无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，揭开了商业战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，彻底揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的财经工作总方针和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针。在文化大革命中，他们和红卫兵小将一起，破旧立新，突出无产阶级政治，使城乡市场焕然一新。通过革命的大批判，商业战线上的广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，真正认识到农业是国民经济的基础，农村是工业市场的主体。他们带着深厚的阶级感情，深入农村，了解农民需要，切实做到凡是农村市场需要的商品，尽可能地优先安排增产，优先调拨供应，做到全心全意为广大贫下中农服务。通过革命的大批判，商业战线上的革命职工，还批判了单纯从本单位狭小利益出发的本位主义思想，树立了为发展社会主义经济服务的全局观点。通过革命的大批判，商业战线上的广大革命职工，还狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人推行的“三自一包”的罪行，加强了无产阶级专政，狠狠打击了投机倒把活动，巩固和发展了社会主义商业阵地。
