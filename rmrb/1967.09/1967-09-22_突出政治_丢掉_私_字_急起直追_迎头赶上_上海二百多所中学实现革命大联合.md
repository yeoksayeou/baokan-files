In the high tide of revolutionary unity, the Red Guards and the revolutionary teachers and staff of more than 270 middle schools in Shanghai have risen to the challenge and are striving to catch up and surpass others. As of September 21, 273 middle schools in the Shanghai urban area have achieved revolutionary unity.

The latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," have had a tremendous impact in the middle schools of all ten districts in the city. The revolutionary youngsters have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions carefully and have expressed their determination to implement them with the spirit of "seizing the day." Under the mighty influence of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, some organizations that were fighting "internal wars" have ceased hostilities, and many "old, difficult problems" have been resolved, leading to a new high tide of revolutionary unity in the city's middle schools.

In this new high tide of revolutionary unity, the young revolutionaries, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a fierce struggle against the "self," striving to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and bravely engaging in self-criticism. In many schools, Red Guards have discussed the leadership core of the new unified organization, emphasizing politics and declaring that they will not compete for positions. They have studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his latest instructions, proposing that the leadership core of the newly established unified revolutionary organization must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and they will support whoever holds it highest.

In this new high tide of revolutionary unity, many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers and staff in various schools have sat down with the revolutionary youngsters to study "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, helping to solve problems related to the great unity. This has played a very good role in promoting the rapid achievement of great unity among the Red Guards in various schools.

    伟大领袖毛主席发出的最新指示“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”，象一声春雷，在全市十个区的中学里引起了巨大的反响。革命小将认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，纷纷表示：革命的大联合是毛主席的伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，我们一定要以“只争朝夕”的精神立即贯彻执行。在毛主席最新指示的巨大威力下，正在打“内战”的一些组织“罢战”了，许多“老大难”的问题迎刃而解，全市中学迅速出现了革命大联合的新高潮。
    在革命大联合的新高潮中，革命小将以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗“私”字，努力克服小资产阶级派性，勇敢地进行自我批评。不少学校的红卫兵小将在讨论新的统一组织的领导核心时，突出政治，表示坚决不争席位。他们通过学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和最新指示，提出：新成立的统一革命组织的领导核心，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，谁的毛泽东思想红旗举得高，我们就选谁。
    不少学校的革命干部和革命教职员工，在革命大联合的新高潮中，同革命小将一起坐下来学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，帮助大家解决大联合中的有关问题，对推动各校红卫兵小将迅速实现大联合起了很好的推动作用。
