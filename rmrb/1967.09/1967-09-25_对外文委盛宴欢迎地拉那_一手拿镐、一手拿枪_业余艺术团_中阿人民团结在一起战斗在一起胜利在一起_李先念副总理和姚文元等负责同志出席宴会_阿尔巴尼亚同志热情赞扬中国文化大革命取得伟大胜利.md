The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a grand banquet this evening to warmly welcome the entire troupe of cultural warriors from the "One Hand a Pickaxe, One Hand a Gun" amateur art troupe from Tirana, Albania, led by Mu. Gerchali. The entire delegation of the Albanian News Delegation, led by Na. Natneli, and the entire delegation of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association, led by Lei. Pedo, who are currently visiting Beijing, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian of the State Council, member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Yao Wenyuan, and other relevant responsible comrades attended the banquet.

Zhang Qixiao, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke first at the banquet. He enthusiastically praised the Albanian people for firmly holding high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of their beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, and under the radiant guidance of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, for wielding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and fervor, to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving great successes. He said, the experiences of the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially in carrying out the ideological and cultural revolution movement, have enriched the treasury of Marxism-Leninism and made new contributions to the great cause of the world proletarian revolution.

Zhang Qixiao said, at present, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country are following the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, closely following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, rapidly achieving revolutionary great unity, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary nature of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, to uproot the poisonous roots of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and ensure that the new China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will remain red forever. Our great leader Chairman Mao's great development of the Marxist-Leninist theory on the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship will have an immeasurably profound influence on the world proletarian revolution.

In his speech, Zhang Qixiao enthusiastically praised the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. He said, the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, is unbreakable by any enemy. To overthrow American imperialism, to overthrow Soviet modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and to carry the socialist revolution and the world proletarian revolution to the end, the peoples of China and Albania will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

Mu. Gerchali, the leader of the delegation, then spoke at the banquet. He said, the Albanian people unreservedly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This cultural revolution has cleared out the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, uprooted the roots of revisionism, consolidated the victory of the socialist cause, and pushed the socialist cause forward. It is a great international historical task to defend and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese people, under the guidance of the thoughts of Chairman Mao, are accomplishing this task.

He said, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has brought joy to all revolutionaries, all Marxist-Leninists, and the people of the world, because it is a great support to them. Only the imperialist clique led by the United States, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries are terrified and hysterically slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. However, as Comrade Enver Hoxha said, "Let the enemies go mad and tremble. No force in the world can stop the 700 million Chinese people from advancing along the socialist and communist road. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will cleanse China of the likes of Khrushchev, and turn the beautiful dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sets a great example for overthrowing the revisionist cliques in power in all parts of the world."

Mu. Gerchali strongly condemned the treacherous acts of the Soviet modern revisionist clique in betraying the revolutionary interests of the peoples of various countries and serving the "global strategy" of American imperialism.

He said, the Khrushchev revisionist clique is the biggest traitorous clique, the biggest counter-revolutionary clique, and the tame tool and faithful dog of imperialism. Therefore, the struggle against modern revisionism is simultaneously a struggle against imperialism led by the United States.

He said, the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Albanian people share weal and woe with the Chinese people and will forever stand together, fight together, and win together. The proletarian revolution will surely achieve victory throughout the world, and our communist ideal will certainly be realized.

The banquet was filled with a revolutionary and friendly atmosphere. The comrades from China and Albania repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" At the end of the banquet, everyone sang "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and Albanian revolutionary songs. The Albanian comrades also sang a song of Chairman Mao's quotations in Chinese.

Albanian Ambassador to China Natneli was invited to attend the banquet.

Before the banquet, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Comrade Yao Wenyuan met with the leaders and some members of the "One Hand a Pickaxe, One Hand a Gun" amateur art troupe from Tirana, Albania, the Albanian News Delegation, and the Albanian Writers and Artists Association Delegation, and had a very cordial conversation with them.

　　中阿人民团结在一起战斗在一起胜利在一起
　　李先念副总理和姚文元等负责同志出席宴会
　　阿尔巴尼亚同志热情赞扬中国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    新华社二十四日讯　对外文委今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎由穆·格尔查利率领的阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团的全体文艺战士。正在北京访问的由纳·纳特奈利率领的阿尔巴尼亚新闻代表团和由莱·培多率领的阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会代表团的全体同志，也应邀出席了宴会。
    国务院副总理李先念，中央文革小组成员姚文元和其他有关方面的负责人，出席了宴会。
    对外文委主任张奚若在宴会上首先讲话。他热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命大旗，在敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的光辉照耀下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，正以冲天的革命干劲和满腔的革命热情，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，取得了伟大的成就。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的经验，特别是开展思想文化革命运动的经验，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库，为推进无产阶级世界革命的伟大事业，作出了新的贡献。
    张奚若说，当前，我国亿万革命群众，正在沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速地实现革命大联合，深入开展革命的大批判，要从政治上、思想上、理论上把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，彻底挖掉修正主义的毒根，防止资本主义复辟，使毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民的新中国，千秋万代，永不变色。我们伟大领袖毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的重大发展，必将对无产阶级世界革命起无限深远的影响。
    张奚若在讲话中热烈赞扬中阿两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊。他说，由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志共同缔造的中阿两国人民的战斗友谊，是任何敌人也破坏不了的。为了打倒美帝国主义，打倒苏联现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为了把社会主义革命和无产阶级世界革命进行到底，中阿两国人民永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    穆·格尔查利团长接着在宴会上讲话。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民毫无保留地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。这场文化大革命清除了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，挖掉了修正主义根子，巩固了社会主义事业的胜利果实。将社会主义事业推向前进，捍卫和加强无产阶级专政，这是伟大的国际历史任务，中国人民正在毛泽东主席的思想的指引下完成着这项任务。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的胜利，使一切革命者，一切马克思列宁主义者和世界人民感到高兴，因为这是对他们的巨大支持。只有以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联修正主义叛徒集团和一切反动派，却怕得要死，歇斯底里地诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命。但是，正如恩维尔·霍查同志所说的，“让敌人发疯发抖吧。世界上没有任何力量能阻拦七亿中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。”
    穆·格尔查利在讲话中强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义集团出卖各国人民革命利益，为美帝国主义的“全球战略”效劳的叛徒行径。
    他说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，是最大的叛徒集团，最大的反革命集团，是帝国主义的驯服工具和忠实走狗。因此，反对现代修正主义的斗争同时也是反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争。
    他说，中阿两国人民之间的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的友谊，阿尔巴尼亚人民同中国人民同甘苦共患难，永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。无产阶级革命必将在全世界取得胜利，我们的共产主义理想必将实现。
    宴会上充满了革命的友好的气氛。中阿两国同志不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”宴会结束时，大家齐唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和阿尔巴尼亚革命歌曲，阿尔巴尼亚同志还用中国话唱了毛主席语录歌。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会以前，李先念副总理和姚文元同志接见了阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团、阿尔巴尼亚新闻代表团、阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会代表团的正副团长和部分成员，同他们进行了十分亲切的谈话。
