Our beloved Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao calls on us: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We Red Guards must achieve new merits in the revolutionary criticism campaign. The revolutionary criticism campaign is a great call from our Commander-in-Chief Mao, a decisive battle to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and thoroughly bury the bourgeois headquarters, a long-term plan for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years to uproot revisionism and advance the world communist movement. In the past, we were able to be daring and bold revolutionary pioneers. Today, we must also be the vanguard of the revolutionary criticism campaign. If there are differences among Red Guard organizations, we should seek common ground while reserving differences, promote revolutionary great unity, strengthen unity, and jointly fight the enemy. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev clique politically, ideologically, and theoretically!

The working class and peasant masses are the main force of the revolutionary criticism campaign. "Intellectuals must unite with the workers and peasants, or they will achieve nothing." Whether one is willing to and actually unites with the workers and peasants is the touchstone of being revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Those who impose their views on the workers and peasants and direct them with a finger are extremely dangerous. Their danger lies in the fact that today they dare to direct the workers and peasants, and tomorrow they will dare to be officials and lords over the workers. Can revolutionary Red Guards be such dangerous people? No, no! We loudly declare: We are forever the good sons of the working people, and we are forever the little students of the workers and peasants! The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for the revolutionary criticism campaign. The Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, summarize experiences, and raise their ideological and combat levels. To consciously carry out the revolutionary criticism campaign, we must study the "Three Articles" well and carry out the ideological revolutionization. We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat.

In the revolutionary criticism campaign, we must have a clear understanding of the current situation. Currently, the situation nationwide is excellent, and the revolutionary criticism campaign is entering an unprecedented new stage. However, we must be aware that the class enemy will extend their black hands from the gutters, stir up trouble, incite splits, create armed conflicts, and bombard the proletarian headquarters, disrupting the revolutionary criticism campaign and attempting to obstruct the victory of the Cultural Revolution. We must dig out this evil black hand and cut it off.

    红卫兵要在革命大批判中立新功
    我们敬爱的林彪副统帅号召我们：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”我们红卫兵一定要在革命大批判中立新功。革命大批判是我们红司令毛主席的伟大号召，是巩固无产阶级专政、彻底埋葬资产阶级司令部的总战役，是彻底挖掉修正主义根子、推进世界共产主义运动的百年大计、千年大计、万年大计。过去我们能够作敢打敢冲的革命闯将，今天我们同样要作革命大批判的急先锋。红卫兵组织之间，如果有分歧，应当在革命大批判中，求同存异，促进革命大联合，加强团结，共同对敌，把中国赫鲁晓夫一伙从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭！
    工农群众是革命大批判的主力军。“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合是革命和不革命或反革命的试金石。那些把自己的观点强加于工农群众，指手划脚地运动工农群众的作法是十分危险的。它的危险在于，他今天敢于在工农群众头上指手划脚，明天他就敢于骑在工农头上做官当老爷。革命红卫兵能够作这样危险的人物吗？不能，不能！我们响亮地回答：我们永远是劳动人民的好儿子，我们永远作工农群众的小学生！战无不胜的毛泽东思想是革命大批判的最锐利武器。毛主席的红小兵要努力学习毛主席著作，总结经验，提高思想水平和斗争水平。要自觉地搞好大批判，就必须学好“老三篇”，搞好思想革命化，“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”。
    在革命大批判运动中，必须清醒地估计当前的形势。当前，全国是一片大好形势，革命大批判运动正进入一个史无前例的新阶段。但是，必须注意，阶级敌人会从阴沟里伸出黑手，播弄是非，煽动分裂，制造武斗，炮打无产阶级司令部，破坏革命大批判，妄想阻挡文化大革命胜利进行。我们一定要把这只罪恶的黑手挖出来，斩断它。
