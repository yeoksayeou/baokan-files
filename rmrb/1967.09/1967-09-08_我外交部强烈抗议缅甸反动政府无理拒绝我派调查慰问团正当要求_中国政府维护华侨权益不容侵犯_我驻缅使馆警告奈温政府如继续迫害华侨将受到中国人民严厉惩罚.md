The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests the unreasonable rejection by the Myanmar reactionary government of the legitimate request to dispatch an investigation and condolence team.

The Chinese government will not tolerate the infringement of the rights of overseas Chinese.

The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar warns the Ne Win government that if it continues to persecute overseas Chinese, it will face severe punishment from the Chinese people.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 6, the responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on September 6, strongly protested to U Mo Mo Kyi, Counselor of the Myanmar Embassy in China, regarding the Myanmar reactionary government's unreasonable rejection of the Chinese government's request to dispatch an investigation and condolence team to Myanmar to comfort the broad masses of affected overseas Chinese.

	In a note from the Myanmar Embassy in China, the Myanmar government, under the pretext of "fulfilling its duty to maintain national sovereignty," unreasonably rejected the Chinese government's request to dispatch an investigation and condolence team to Myanmar and once again refused to allow the Chinese government to transport relief supplies to overseas Chinese.

	The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau solemnly pointed out that the Myanmar reactionary government is continuing to brutally persecute overseas Chinese. The Chinese government absolutely cannot stand idly by. The Chinese government's dispatch of an investigation and condolence team is completely legitimate and reasonable. However, the Myanmar reactionary government, fearing that the Chinese government's investigation and condolence team would expose to the world the heinous crimes of the Myanmar government's brutal persecution of overseas Chinese, arbitrarily and unreasonably rejected the Chinese government's representative team from entering Myanmar. This can only arouse greater indignation from the Chinese government and people. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the Myanmar government.

	The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau sternly refuted the Myanmar government's extremely absurd pretext of "fulfilling its duty to maintain national sovereignty." He pointed out that the Chinese government has the right to protect the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese from being infringed upon. The Chinese government's dispatch of an investigation and condolence team is a matter of relations between the two countries and is absolutely not a matter of "national sovereignty" as the Myanmar government claims.

	The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau solemnly warned that the Ne Win government, time and time again, has rejected the series of legitimate demands made by the Chinese government to protect the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government and people. The Ne Win government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 6, Yangon news: On September 4, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar sent a note to the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the new crimes of the Myanmar reactionary government in illegally arresting 13 patriotic overseas Chinese in Yangon, Mogok, and Kyaukme, and strongly demanding the immediate release of the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese and the immediate cessation of all persecution against them.

	According to the Chinese Embassy, the Myanmar reactionary government illegally arrested the patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Youtao and Chen Zhongxin in Mogok on June 27, Chen Guifu in Yangon on July 1, and Huang Yubing (Huang Hanbo) in Kyaukme. On August 21 and 22, nine more patriotic overseas Chinese, including Wu Shouping, Zhang Shaochun, Zhuo Jifa, Wan Yibin, Wei Binghong, Li Qirong, Shi Zhenfa, Liu Shirong, and Zeng Baozhen, were illegally arrested in Mogok.

	Before arresting these patriotic overseas Chinese, the Myanmar reactionary government could not come up with a single so-called "charge." After the arrests, the Myanmar reactionary military police and secret police subjected them to various forms of torture. The Chinese Embassy warned in the note: "If you ignore the embassy's warning and continue to persecute the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese and even go so far as to harm them, the Chinese people will severely punish you."

　　我外交部强烈抗议缅甸反动政府无理拒绝我派调查慰问团正当要求
　　中国政府维护华侨权益不容侵犯
　　我驻缅使馆警告奈温政府如继续迫害华侨将受到中国人民严厉惩罚
    据新华社六日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人九月六日就缅甸反动政府无理拒绝中国政府派遣调查慰问团前往缅甸对广大受害华侨进行慰问，向缅甸驻华大使馆参赞吴貌貌基提出最强烈的抗议。
    在吴貌貌基交来的缅甸驻华大使馆的一个照会中，缅甸政府竟然以所谓“为了履行其维护国家主权的职责”作为借口，无理拒绝中国政府关于派遣调查慰问团去缅甸的要求，再次拒绝中国政府运送救济物品救济华侨。
    第一亚洲司负责人严正指出，缅甸反动政府正在继续残酷迫害华侨。对此，中国政府绝对不能坐视不理。中国政府派遣调查慰问团是完全正当合理的。但是缅甸反动政府深怕中国政府调查慰问团把缅甸政府残酷迫害华侨的滔天罪行向全世界揭露，蛮横无理地拒绝中国政府代表团前往缅甸。这只能激起中国政府和中国人民更大的愤慨。中国政府就此向缅甸政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    第一亚洲司负责人严词驳斥了缅甸政府所谓“履行其维护国家主权的职责”这种极端荒谬的借口。他指出，中国政府完全有权维护华侨的正当权益不受侵犯。中国政府派遣调查慰问团是属于两国关系的问题，绝不是象缅甸政府所说的什么“国家主权”问题。
    第一亚洲司负责人严正警告说，奈温政府一而再、再而三地拒绝了中国政府为了维护华侨的正当权益所提出的一系列正当要求，这是中国政府和中国人民绝对不能容忍的，奈温政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    据新华社六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆四日照会缅甸外交部，强烈抗议缅甸反动政府在仰光、毛礼和吉叨等地非法逮捕爱国华侨十三人的新罪行，强烈要求立即释放被捕的爱国华侨和立即停止对他们的一切迫害。
    据中国大使馆了解，缅甸反动政府六月二十七日非法逮捕了毛礼爱国华侨陈友涛、陈忠信和仰光爱国华侨陈贵发，七月一日非法逮捕了吉叨爱国华侨黄奕鎗（黄汉波），八月二十一日和二十二日，在毛礼非法逮捕了爱国华侨巫授平、张少春、卓继发、万义斌、魏炳焜、李启荣、施振发、刘仕荣、曾保真等九人。
    缅甸反动政府在逮捕这些爱国华侨前，根本提不出一条所谓“罪状”。在逮捕后，缅甸反动军警特务对他们百般虐待。中国大使馆在照会中严正警告缅甸反动政府：“假如你们竟不顾大使馆警告，继续迫害被捕爱国华侨并进而对他们狠下毒手，中国人民将最严厉地惩罚你们。”
