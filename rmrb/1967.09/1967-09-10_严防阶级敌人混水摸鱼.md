	Guard Against Class Enemies Taking Advantage of the Chaos
	Beijing Pinggu County Farmers' Representative Assembly, Li Shulin, Zhang Fengying

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article is excellent. It layer by layer peels off the false facade of Tao Zhu, thoroughly exposing and criticizing his anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary essence. In this article, Comrade Yao Wenyuan also raises a very important issue for us: we must not allow Tao Zhu-like figures to disrupt our ranks from the right or "left" sides, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. He reminds us to maintain high revolutionary vigilance and guard against class enemies taking advantage of the chaos.

	The situation of the Cultural Revolution in Pinggu County is as excellent as the nationwide situation, getting better and better. Currently, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in our county are, according to the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism. Each production brigade uses blackboard newspapers, radio stations, big-character posters, criticism columns, and various forms of art to set up battlefields in the fields, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Pinggu County's various counter-revolutionary fallacies from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev, and make him never be able to turn over a new leaf.

	Regarding the massive revolutionary criticism participated in by hundreds of millions of people, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party are terrified and hateful. Because the vast majority of people participate in revolutionary criticism, it is to thoroughly expose their conspiracy to restore capitalism and thoroughly eliminate all the poison of revisionism they spread. Therefore, they are still not reconciled and further collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all ghosts and snakes, using various despicable means from the extreme "left" or right sides to sabotage the revolutionary criticism. They stir up trouble within the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat, sow discord, create splits; they spread rumors, confuse the masses, create chaos; they instigate armed struggles, sabotage production; they incite some uninformed masses to direct their spears at the great People's Liberation Army of China, and so on. The actions of the class enemies sound an alarm for us: the enemy is not sleeping!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggle." In the current excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must keep a clear head, closely watch the movements of the class enemies, and guard against the class enemies disrupting our direction of struggle from the extreme "left" and right sides. We will not give the enemy any opportunity, not even a single straw.

　　严防阶级敌人混水摸鱼
　　北京平谷县农代会　李树林　张凤英
    姚文元同志的文章写得好极了，一层一层地剥开了陶铸伪装的画皮，彻底揭露和批判了他反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反动本质。姚文元同志在这篇文章中，还向我们提出了一个很重要的问题，就是决不能让陶铸式的人物从右的方面或“左”的方面来搅乱我们的阵线，打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署。提醒我们保持高度的革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人混水摸鱼。
    我们平谷县文化大革命的形势，同全国文化大革命的形势一样，空前大好，越来越好。当前，我们县的广大贫下中农，正按照伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。各社队利用黑板报、广播站、大字报、批判专栏和召开批判会、控诉会及各种文艺形式，在田间地头，摆开了战场，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在平谷县的代理人的各种反革命谬论。决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，让他永世不得翻身。
    对于亿万群众参加的声势浩大的革命大批判，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派怕得要死，恨得要命。因为广大群众参加革命大批判，就是要彻底揭发他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，彻底肃清他们散布的一切修正主义流毒。所以他们还不死心，进而勾结地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神，利用各种卑鄙的手段从极“左”的或右的方面，来破坏革命的大批判。他们在无产阶级革命派内部煽阴风，点鬼火，挑拨离间，制造分裂；他们散布谣言，迷惑群众，制造混乱；他们挑起武斗，破坏生产；他们煽动一些不明真相的群众，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军，等等。阶级敌人的这些行动，向我们敲起了警钟：敌人没有睡觉！
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，我们无产阶级革命派一定要保持清醒的头脑，密切注视阶级敌人的动向，严防阶级敌人从极“左”的方面和右的方面来搅乱我们斗争的大方向。我们决不给敌人以任何可乘之机，让他们一根稻草也捞不到。
