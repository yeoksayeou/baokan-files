The broad masses of community members and cadres in the cotton-growing regions of northern and southern China have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and directed the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the struggle to develop cotton production. They have achieved inspiring results: the cotton-growing regions of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Northeast, Northwest, and South China all have cotton growth that is generally better than the bumper harvest of last year. Currently, the early cotton bolls are gradually opening, and the broad masses of community members are confidently strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields, striving for an even greater cotton harvest this year. Some places have already started picking the first flowers, and in some places, new cotton has already hit the market. The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are actively engaged in procurement. Recently, the State Council has dispatched "Revolution and Production" cotton teams to various major cotton-producing areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and assist local areas in doing a good job of cotton production and procurement.

This year, China's cotton production presents a very good situation. This is the result of the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-growing regions raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "Revolution and Production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the result of the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is also the result of the active support of the People's Liberation Army for agriculture.

During this year's cotton production period, it was precisely when the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in China took up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a total offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-growing regions actively participated in this great struggle. Based on their personal experiences and feelings, they conducted in-depth exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," and "four freedoms" advocated by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This greatly raised the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres, effectively promoting cotton production.

Various cotton-growing regions have established and improved cotton production specialist teams to lead community members in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide cotton production. During the intense sowing period, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "making a firm decision, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" to actively overcome various unfavorable factors, ensuring the quality and quantity of the sowing task.

The southern cotton-growing regions faced low temperatures and heavy rain during the sowing period, which brought many difficulties to sowing. However, the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres were not afraid of difficulties or hardships and used every possible means to overcome the unfavorable climate conditions, finally completing the sowing task successfully. Some regions even exceeded the original plan. The northern cotton-growing regions, with slightly better climate conditions, completed sowing earlier than last year, and the degree of dense planting was also higher than last year. After the cotton entered the growth period, many cotton-growing regions in the north and some in the south successively encountered pest infestations. The broad masses of community members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, used the method of "people's war" to launch a mass campaign to exterminate pests and eliminate hazards, conducting pest extermination five or six times in succession. They timely controlled the spread of pests, ensuring the normal growth of cotton.

    革命大批判调动了广大社员和干部的生产积极性
    全国棉花长势普遍比去年好
    新华社十二日讯　我国南北棉区的广大社员和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到发展棉花生产的斗争中去，取得了令人鼓舞的战绩：黄河流域、长江流域和东北、西北、华南的广大棉区，棉花长势普遍好于丰收的去年。目前，早期棉铃正陆续吐絮，广大社员群众正满怀信心地加强棉田后期管理，争取今年棉花更大丰收。有些地方已经开始采摘头喷花，有些地方新棉已经上市，基层供销社正在积极进行收购。最近国务院已派出“抓革命，促生产”棉花小组，分赴各棉花集中产区宣传毛泽东思想，协助各地做好棉花生产和收购工作。
    今年我国棉花生产呈现一派大好形势，是在无产阶级文化大革命中棉区广大社员和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果，是广大社员和革命干部进一步活学活用毛主席著作的结果，也是人民解放军积极支援农业的结果。
    今年棉花生产期间，正是我国亿万革命群众奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的时候。棉区的广大社员和革命干部，积极投入了这一伟大斗争。他们根据自己的切身经历和体会，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论，进行深入的大揭发、大批判，从而大大地提高了广大社员、革命干部的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性，有力地促进了棉花生产。
    各棉区普遍建立和健全了棉花生产专业班子，领导社员用毛泽东思想统帅棉花生产。在紧张的播种期间里，他们按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，积极克服各种不利因素，保质、保量地完成了播种任务。
    南方棉区在播种时期低温多雨，给播种带来不少困难，但广大社员和革命干部不怕难、不怕苦，千方百计地克服不利的气候条件，终于胜利地完成了播种任务，部分地区播种面积还超过了原订计划。气候条件稍好的北方棉区，完成播种的时间普遍比去年有所提前，密植的程度也比去年又有所提高。棉花进入生长期后，北方许多棉区和南方部分棉区先后发生虫害，广大社员又遵照毛主席的教导，用打“人民战争”的方法，掀起了群众性的灭虫除害的斗争，连续灭虫达五六次，及时地控制了虫害的蔓延，保证了棉花的正常生长。
