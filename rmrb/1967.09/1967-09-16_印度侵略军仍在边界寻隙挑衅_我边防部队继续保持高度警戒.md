Indian aggressor troops stationed along the Sino-Indian border have been persistently provoking incidents at Naidongla, Qunpu Tang, and Gawu Si. After our heroic People's Liberation Army in Tibet conducted resolute and powerful self-defense counterattacks, the Indian troops ceased their artillery shelling on the 14th. However, the Indian military commanders still ordered their soldiers to fire rifles and submachine guns into our territory around 8 PM on the same day. On the 15th, two high-ranking Indian military officers were seen active at the forward positions of the Indian troops at Naidongla Pass. Our People's Liberation Army continues to maintain high alert. We must once again warn the reactionary Indian government: you will not gain anything from your military provocations against China. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, will give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade in order to defend our sacred territory.

    印度侵略军仍在边界寻隙挑衅  我边防部队继续保持高度警戒
    新华社拉萨十五日电　据我西藏边防部队报告：盘踞在中锡边境向我侧乃堆拉、春丕塘、嘎觉寺等地疯狂炮击的印度侵略军，经我英雄的人民解放军西藏边防部队进行坚决有力的自卫还击以后，十四日暂时停止了炮击，但是，印军指挥官仍然命令士兵在当天下午八时许用步枪、冲锋枪向我境内进行射击。十五日下午，两名印度高级军官到乃堆拉山口印军前沿阵地进行活动。我人民解放军继续保持着高度的警戒。我们要再次警告印度反动政府，你们休想在对中国的军事挑衅中，捞到任何稻草。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，为了保卫祖国神圣领土，对于任何敢于来犯的敌人，必将给予毁灭性的打击。
