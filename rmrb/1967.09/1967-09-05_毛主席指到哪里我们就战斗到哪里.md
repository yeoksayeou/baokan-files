Wherever Chairman Mao Points, We Will Fight There

In the current excellent revolutionary situation, at this crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing, the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao, based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has issued an important battle command. We feel extremely excited and full of energy. We immediately convened a meeting and arranged for the factory to further carry out the revolutionary great criticism battle task. We are determined to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and push the Cultural Revolution to victory.

We believe that how closely we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and how firmly we execute the commands of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters is the touchstone to test whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, and it is a new test for us proletarian revolutionaries. We proletarian revolutionaries listen most to Chairman Mao's words, and we execute the commands of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters most firmly. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we fight there. The battle command issued by the Proletarian Headquarters this time has further clarified the direction of struggle for us proletarian revolutionaries, is a great driving force for the victory of the Cultural Revolution, and is a powerful ideological weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must become a model in executing this important battle command.

We deeply feel that only by closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle can the Cultural Revolution advance from one victory to another. The proletarian revolutionaries in our factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, quickly realized the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Through this stage of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out the revolutionary great criticism, the political consciousness of the revolutionary masses in the entire factory has greatly improved, truly achieving "grasp revolution, promote production." In the first seven months of this year compared to the same period last year, production increased by 22%, output value increased by 26%, cost decreased by 7%, and profit remittance increased by 29%. This is the rich fruit of the Cultural Revolution, and it is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in our factory.

We must further, according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out the revolutionary great criticism more broadly and deeply, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, everyone takes action, verbally and in writing, fight a "people's war," and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the Party, overthrow and thoroughly criticize them, and do a good job of fighting, criticizing, and transforming our factory. We are determined, in the struggle, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, with higher revolutionary enthusiasm, firmly grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　毛主席指到哪里我们就战斗到哪里
　　上海异型钢管厂革命委员会
    在当前大好的革命形势下，在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，从无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，传来了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部根据毛主席的伟大战略部署发出的重要战斗号令。我们感到非常兴奋，浑身是劲。我们立即召开会议，布置了本厂进一步开展革命大批判的战斗任务。我们决心紧紧跟上伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，把文化大革命胜利推向前进。
    我们认为，对毛主席的伟大战略部署，跟得紧不紧，对毛主席无产阶级司令部的号令执行坚决不坚决，是检验我们是不是忠于毛主席和毛主席的革命路线的试金石，是对我们无产阶级革命派的新考验。我们无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，对毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令，执行最坚决。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。毛主席指到哪里，我们就战斗到哪里。无产阶级司令部这次发出的战斗号令，给我们无产阶级革命派进一步指明了斗争方向，是推动文化大革命胜利前进的巨大动力，是彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的强大思想武器。我们一定要成为执行这个重要战斗号令的模范。
    我们深深体会到，只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，文化大革命才能从一个胜利走向一个新的胜利。我们厂的无产阶级革命派，就是在毛主席的革命路线指引下，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，才迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。通过这一阶段活学活用毛主席著作和开展革命的大批判，全厂革命群众的政治觉悟大大提高，真正做到了“抓革命，促生产”。今年头七个月与去年同期相比，产量增长百分之二十二，产值增长百分之二十六，成本下降百分之七，利润上缴增长百分之二十九。这是文化大革命的丰硕成果，这是毛泽东思想在我厂的巨大胜利。
    我们一定要进一步按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命大批判更广泛更深入地开展起来，集中火力，集中目标，人人动手，口诛笔伐，打一场“人民战争”，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，批倒批臭，搞好本厂的斗批改。我们决心在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以更高的战斗热情狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取更多更快更好更省地完成国家交给我们的任务。
