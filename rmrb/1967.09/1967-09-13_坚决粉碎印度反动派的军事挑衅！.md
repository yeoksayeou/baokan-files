Title: Resolutely Crush the Military Provocations of the Indian Reactionaries!

On September 11, the Indian aggressor army crossed the China-Sikkim border and launched a military provocation against us, killing and injuring 36 of our border defense soldiers. The Indian reactionary government's extremely serious armed aggression has been met with resolute counterattacks from our border defense troops and has aroused the indignation of all the military and civilian people of our country. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already lodged the most serious protest and warning with the Indian reactionary government. We fully support our government's just stance and are standing by, ready to fight, to be the backbone of our brotherly troops guarding the border of our motherland.

The Indian reactionary government's crazed provocation of large-scale military aggression at this time is not accidental. This does not indicate the strength of the Indian reactionaries but rather their internal and external difficulties, their desperation, and their attempt to divert the attention of their people through new anti-China provocations, to beg for more "aid" from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and to maintain their shaky reactionary rule.

Due to the Indian National Congress reactionary government's intensified exploitation of the laboring people at home and its reliance on the U.S. and Soviet masters abroad, pursuing a treacherous and dictatorial policy of selling out the country, class contradictions in India are becoming increasingly sharp, and political and economic crises are becoming increasingly severe. The broad masses of the Indian people can no longer live, and they are rising up to fight against violence and to overthrow the National Congress government. In recent years, the workers', peasants', and students' movements in India have been surging and developing vigorously. In particular, the broad masses of peasants in the Nasalbari region of Darjeeling County, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have taken up arms and ignited the spark of armed struggle of the Indian people, striking a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the National Congress government. Today's India is full of dry wood everywhere, and everywhere there is a situation of imminent explosion. The National Congress reactionary government is like sitting on a volcano about to erupt, living in constant fear.

It is precisely because the National Congress government of India can no longer rule that it wants to grab a lifeline from anti-China provocations. The facts prove that the Indian reactionary government's creation of this Sino-Indian border incident is entirely premeditated. As early as two months ago, the Indian Defense Minister Swaran Singh was shouting about the need to "strengthen forces" to "bravely deal with China." And two days before this border provocation incident, the New Delhi "Lightning" weekly openly clamored that the "Sino-Indian (border) dispute must be re-examined," and the Indian armed forces must "take all steps to recover" the so-called "Northeast Frontier Agency territory forcibly occupied by China." Such naked war cries, do they not clearly expose the Indian reactionary government's aggressive plot? The facts are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable. Even if the Indian reactionary government plays the trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief,'" it can absolutely not cover up its evil face.

Of course, the Indian reactionaries have the audacity to carry out anti-China provocations because they think they have two backers, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, in order to realize their dream of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," have long since established the infamous "Three N Company" in India. Now the founders of the "Three N Company" have either died or been ousted, but the "Three N Company" is still struggling to survive. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists have long regarded India as an important stronghold in their anti-China military encirclement, closely coordinating and vigorously supporting the Indian reactionaries. They spare no effort to beautify the Indian reactionaries and to boost their morale. And the Indian reactionaries, in order to beg for a few scraps from their masters and to maintain their reactionary rule, are willing to sell national interests, making India increasingly a new colony of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and are determined to be the vanguard of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in anti-China actions.

As early as 1959, the Indian reactionaries acted as the vanguard of U.S.-Soviet anti-China actions, provoking border conflicts with China. In October 1962, the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on our border. Before the attack, the U.S. imperialists provided their lackeys with a large amount of loans, food, and weapons, and actively plotted and schemed. The Soviet revisionists also cooperated with the U.S. imperialists, providing the Indian reactionaries with a large number of MiG-21 fighter jets and military helicopters, and sending pilots under the pretext of "testing helicopters" to secretly reconnoiter the Sino-Indian border with the Indian aggressor commander Kaul. It was with the help and support of the U.S. and the Soviet Union that the Indian reactionaries launched a large-scale attack on our border.

However, even if the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists arm the Indian reactionaries to the teeth, they will not be able to touch a single hair of the Chinese people. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We once defeated the Indian aggressor army in the self-defense counterattack war of 1962, not only capturing U.S. tanks and cannons and shooting down Soviet helicopters but also capturing a large number of Indian aggressor troops. Our self-defense counterattack war achieved great victory.

We warn the Indian reactionaries: Do not forget the lesson of 1962, do not miscalculate, and if you do not stop in time, you will repeat the fate of 1962. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out that for those who come to attack, "our party will definitely stand on the self-defense position and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them." If the Indian aggressors ignore the solemn warning of the Chinese government and people and continue to act recklessly, then let them taste the iron fist of the Chinese people again!

### 坚决粉碎印度反动派的军事挑衅！

    坚决粉碎印度反动派的军事挑衅！
    中国人民解放军成都部队  某连副指导员、战斗英雄  陈代富
    九月十一日，印度侵略军越过中国—锡金边界向我进行军事挑衅，打死打伤我边防战士三十六人。印度反动政府的这个极其严重的武装侵略罪行，遭到了我边防部队战士的坚决反击，激起了我全国军民的无比愤慨。我国外交部已经向印度反动政府提出最严重的抗议和警告。我们完全支持我国政府的严正立场，并且严阵以待，誓作守卫在祖国边防的兄弟部队的后盾。
    印度反动政府在这个时候疯狂地挑起大规模的军事挑衅，这决不是偶然的。这并不说明印度反动派的强大，而是说明它的内外交困，走投无路，妄想通过新的反华挑衅来转移国内人民的视线，向美帝苏修乞求更多的“援助”，来维持它摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    由于印度国大党反动政府对内加紧压榨劳动人民、对外投靠美苏主子，奉行卖国独裁的反动政策，印度国内的阶级矛盾越来越尖锐，政治经济危机越来越严重。广大的印度人民活不下去了，纷纷起来进行抗暴斗争，大造国大党政府的反。近年来，印度的工人运动，农民运动和学生运动风起云涌，蓬勃发展。特别是最近大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里的广大农民，在印共革命派的领导之下，拿起武器，燃起了印度人民武装斗争的星星之火，沉重地打击了国大党政府的反动统治。今天的印度，到处都布满了干柴，到处都有一触即发之势，国大党反动政府好比坐在一座喷焰欲燃的火山上一样，惶惶不可终日。
    正是因为印度国大党政府统治不下去了，它才想从反华挑衅中来捞一根救命稻草。事实证明，印度反动政府制造这次中印边境事件，完全是预谋的。早在两个月前，印度国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格就高喊什么要“加强力量”来“勇敢地对付中国”。而在这次边境挑衅事件发生之前两天，新德里的《闪电》周报又公然叫嚷“中印（边界）争端必须重新研究”，印度武装部队必须“采取一切步骤收复”所谓“被中国强行占领的东北边境特区领土”。这种赤裸裸的战争叫嚣难道不是清楚地暴露出印度反动政府的侵略阴谋吗？事实俱在，铁证如山。印度反动政府即使玩弄“贼喊捉贼”的手法，也是绝对掩盖不了它的凶恶面目。
    当然，印度反动派之所以有这样大的狗胆来进行反华挑衅，是因为它自以为有美帝苏修两个后台老板在撑腰。美帝苏修为了实现“美苏合作主宰世界”的迷梦，早就在印度创办了臭名昭著的“三尼公司”。现在“三尼公司”的创始人有的死了，有的下台了。但“三尼公司”却还在惨淡经营。美帝苏修早就把印度看成他们反华军事包围圈的一个重要据点，一直紧密配合，大力扶植印度反动派。他们千方百计地为印度反动派涂脂抹粉，不遗余力地为印度反动派打气输血。而印度反动派为了向主子讨得一点残汤剩饭，维持自己的反动统治，不惜出卖民族利益，使印度日益沦为美帝苏修的新殖民地，并死心塌地的充当美帝苏修的反华急先锋。
    早在一九五九年，印度反动派就充当了美苏反华的马前卒，挑起与中国的边界冲突。一九六二年十月，印度反动派又向我国边境发动了大规模进攻。在进攻之前，美帝向其奴才提供了大量的贷款、粮食和武器装备，并积极出谋划策。苏修也配合美帝，向印度反动派提供了大量的米格—21型战斗机和军用直升飞机，并派驾驶员以“试验直升飞机”为名，把印度侵略军司令考尔载到中印边界上空进行秘密侦察。印度反动派正是在美苏的帮助和支持之下向我国边境发动大规模进攻的。
    但是，美帝苏修即使把印度反动派武装到牙齿，也休想触动中国人民的一根毫毛。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民决不是好惹的。我们曾经在一九六二年的自卫反击战中把印度侵略军队打得落花流水，不但缴获了美帝的坦克大炮，击落了苏修的直升飞机，而且俘虏了大量的印度侵略军队。我们的自卫反击战取得了伟大的胜利。
    我们警告印度反动派：你们不要忘记一九六二年的教训，不要打错了算盘，如再不悬崖勒马，必将重蹈一九六二年的覆辙。我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出，有来犯者，“我党必定站在自卫立场上坚决彻底干净全部消灭之”。印度侵略者如果对中国政府和人民的严正警告置若罔闻，继续一意孤行，那就请它再一次尝尝中国人民的铁拳吧！
