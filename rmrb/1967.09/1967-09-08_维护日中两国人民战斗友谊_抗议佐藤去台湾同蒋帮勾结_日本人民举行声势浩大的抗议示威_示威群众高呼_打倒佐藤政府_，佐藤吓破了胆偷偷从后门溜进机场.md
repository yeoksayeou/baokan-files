	Maintaining the Combat Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Japan; Protesting Sato's Visit to Taiwan to Collude with the Chiang Kai-shek Clique
	Japanese People Hold a Massive Protest Demonstration
	Protesters Shout "Down with the Sato Government," Sato Flees in Fear Through the Back Door of the Airport

	New China News Agency, September 7th: According to the Oriental News Agency: Five hundred revolutionary youth and patriotic individuals from various sectors in Japan held a massive protest rally at Tokyo International Airport on the 7th, strongly protesting against Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, visiting Taiwan to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and plot new anti-China schemes. They maintained the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan with their actual actions.

	Kuroda Juman, Chairman of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), participated in the protest rally. The protesters shouted slogans such as "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Smash the Sato government's policy of hostility towards China!" "Down with the Sato government!" "U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan!" "Strengthen the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" They bravely and tenaciously fought against the armed police who came to suppress them.

	Sato Eisaku was frightened by the roars and struggles of the protesters. He dared not enter through the main gate of the airport and had to sneak in through the back door. Just as Sato was about to board the plane, he was discovered by a group of Japanese youth waiting inside the airport. Despite the police's baton beatings, they bravely rushed towards Sato, holding up a giant banner reading "Oppose Sato's Visit to Taiwan," denouncing the despicable actions of the Sato government's pro-U.S., anti-Soviet, and anti-China policies, and shouting in unison "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" They expressed their deep hatred for the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Japanese Sato government, and at the same time expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao.

	In the afternoon, around 1:00 PM, Sato Eisaku hastily flew to Taipei amidst the angry denunciations of the Japanese people.

	New China News Agency, September 5th: According to the Oriental News Agency: A protest delegation consisting of more than 100 members of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association held a demonstration in front of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence on the 4th, strongly protesting against Sato Eisaku's decision to "visit" Taiwan and South Vietnam, following the U.S. imperialist's plot to create "two Chinas."

	The protest delegation angrily shouted slogans such as "Oppose the Sato government's anti-China policy!" "Do not allow Sato to go to Taiwan!" and so on.

	The reactionary Sato government dispatched the mobile police to suppress the protest. The protest delegation broke through the difficulties and sent 13 representatives to meet with the Vice-Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, handing over a letter of protest from the Director of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Hagiwara Teiji, to Sato Eisaku.

	The protest letter stated that Sato, on this occasion, is carrying out the task of creating "two Chinas" and expanding the war in Vietnam, which was given to him by the United States, to engage in conspiracy activities in Taiwan and South Vietnam. We express our most resolute opposition to this.

	The protest letter stated that we firmly demand that Prime Minister Sato cancel his trip to Taiwan and South Vietnam, abolish the "Kishida Letter," and immediately issue entry visas to the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association visiting Japan without any conditions.

    新华社七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命青年和各界爱国人士五百人，七日在东京国际机场举行了声势浩大的示威集会，强烈抗议日本首相佐藤荣作在美帝国主义的指使下，去台湾勾结蒋介石匪帮策划反华新阴谋。他们用实际行动维护着日中两国人民的战斗友谊。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部会长黑田寿男等参加了示威集会。示威群众高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“粉碎佐藤政府敌视中国的政策！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”“加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊！”等口号。他们同前来镇压的武装警察进行了英勇顽强的搏斗。
    佐藤荣作被示威群众的怒吼和斗争吓破了胆。他不敢从机场的正门进去，不得不偷偷地从后门溜进机场。当佐藤刚要爬上飞机时，又被等待在机场里面的一群日本青年发现。他们不顾警察的棍棒殴打，立即勇敢地冲向佐藤，举着“反对佐藤访问台湾”的巨型横幅，怒斥佐藤政府的亲美联苏反华的卑劣行径，并齐声高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”表达了他们对美帝走狗日本佐藤政府的无比憎恨，同时也表达了日本人民对毛主席的无限热爱。
    下午一点多钟，佐藤荣作在日本人民的愤怒声讨中匆匆飞向台北。
    新华社五日讯　据东方通讯社报道：由日本国际贸易促进协会一百多名会员组成的抗议团，四日在日本首相官邸前面举行示威，强烈抗议佐藤荣作决定“访问”台湾和南越，追随美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。
    抗议团愤怒地高呼“反对佐藤政府实行反华政策！”“不许佐藤去台湾！”等口号。
    佐藤反动政府出动了机动队进行镇压。抗议团冲破困难，派出十三名代表会见了日本政府官房副长官，并递交了日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事萩原定司给佐藤荣作的一封抗议信。
    抗议信说，佐藤这次带着美国交给他的制造“两个中国”和扩大侵越战争的任务，去台湾和南越搞阴谋活动，对此我们表示最坚决的反对。
    抗议信说，我们坚决要求佐藤首相取消台湾和南越之行，废除“吉田书简”，并立即无条件地发给中日友好协会访日代表团入境签证。
