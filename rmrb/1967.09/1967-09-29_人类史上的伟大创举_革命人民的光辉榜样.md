The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has made a tremendous contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism and the promotion of the world revolution, exerting a tremendous influence internationally.

The Communist Party of Thailand, in its December 1, 1966, letter to compatriots commemorating the 24th anniversary of the party's founding, gave a high evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. It pointed out: "The great proletarian cultural revolution now vigorously unfolding in China is a great initiative of the Communist Party of China under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong; it is an unprecedented revolutionary movement; it has raised Marxism-Leninism to a new and higher stage; it is a measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to uproot the social roots of revisionism, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to open the road for a smooth transition from a socialist society to a communist society. The strength of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and the achievements they have won have a great impact on the revolutionary movement of the people of the world." "China is the strongest revolutionary bulwark. It is the most reliable and trustworthy friend of the revolutionary peoples and oppressed nations of the world. Therefore, to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people and defend the People's Republic of China from the sabotage of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is a duty of the revolutionary peoples of the world, including the Thai people."

Chairman Mao summed up the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, mobilized hundreds of millions of people, and launched an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thus solving the problem of how to carry out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the problem of preventing the restoration of capitalism in theory and practice. This is a reliable guarantee that the Communist Party of China and the state will never change color.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has set a brilliant example for the revolutionary peoples of the whole world. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, making a great contribution to the theoretical treasury of Marxism-Leninism and the world communist movement. Mao Zedong Thought is the third great milestone in the development of Marxism.

In leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao fully relied on the masses, fully believed in the masses, and fully mobilized the masses, respecting the masses' initiative. During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people enjoyed the broadest democracy, such as the "four bigs": speaking out freely, airing views fully, writing big-character posters, and holding great debates. The target was concentrated, and the firepower was concentrated to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticizing and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is the reliable defender and powerful pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is excellent. The broad revolutionary masses are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carrying out mass revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary great unity, so as to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. At present, the struggle between the two lines and the two roads has entered the decisive stage. The proletarian revolutionary factions on all fronts are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, overcoming factionalism, strengthening party spirit, achieving and consolidating revolutionary great unity, and uniting as one to smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and strive for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The broad proletarian revolutionary factions, while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, also seize the power of the "self" in their minds, carry out self-revolution, and transform their worldview, making themselves into thorough revolutionaries.

The broad revolutionary masses in China have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," achieving brilliant successes in the cause of building socialism.

The triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries in the world tremble with fear, because they have seen their doom approaching. However, all the people of the world are jubilant and enthusiastic in welcoming the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Just as the revolutionary peoples of the whole world, the Thai people see that socialist China is guaranteed not to change color and has become a strong base for the world revolution, which has greatly boosted their fighting spirit and given them tremendous encouragement. Although the imperialists, modern revisionists, and the Thanom-Prapas sellout clique are sparing no effort to operate all their propaganda machines and using every means to slander and attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, attempting to diminish its influence. But all this is in vain. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people have firmly resisted Soviet Khrushchev revisionism and the "parliamentary road" of the Chinese Khrushchev; they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely chosen the road of armed seizure of power; taken up arms to oppose U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Prapas sellout clique, established rural base areas, and surrounded the cities with the countryside, ultimately seizing power nationwide. Now we are more steadfast than ever in adhering to the completely correct road indicated by Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the revolutionary fighters and patriots in Thailand realize more deeply that Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible and powerful ideological weapon. Chairman Mao's great image and lofty prestige are increasingly entering the hearts of revolutionary masses, especially the hearts of the fighters in the Thai people's armed forces. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the number of fighters who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works is increasing. Chairman Mao's works have given the cadres and fighters of the Thai people's armed forces tremendous strength, educating and training them to become good fighters who are not afraid of hardship and not afraid of death.

Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "In Memory of Dr. Norman Bethune," and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are the most sharp ideological weapons of all fighters. Under the condition of lacking books, fighters and masses listen to the Thai-language broadcasts of Beijing Radio, record the broadcasted works of Chairman Mao, and then memorize and study them, applying what they have learned. When facing the brutal suppression of the enemy, the burning of houses, and the massacre of relatives and friends, the masses are in the most difficult times, a passage from Chairman Mao's works: "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." gives the masses great encouragement. In the most difficult times, Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, raise our morale." inspire the morale of fighters and masses, making them fight with full confidence and revolutionary enthusiasm. In battle, the people's armed forces flexibly apply Chairman Mao's military thought, achieving brilliant victories.

Let the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries cry and tremble in the face of the revolutionary storm of the peoples of the world and the triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China! The revolutionary peoples of the whole world, including the Thai people, will, under the great encouragement of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, march forward with heroic strides toward a brilliant future!

    人类史上的伟大创举　革命人民的光辉榜样
    泰国　倪密特
    由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，对发展马克思列宁主义和促进世界革命作出了伟大的贡献，在国际上产生了巨大的影响。
    泰国共产党在一九六六年十二月一日纪念党成立二十四周年告同胞书中，对中国无产阶级文化大革命作过高度的评价。它指出：“正在中国轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是毛泽东同志亲自领导下的中国共产党的伟大创举；是史无前例的革命运动；是把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段；是巩固无产阶级专政的措施，挖掉修正主义的社会根子，防止资本主义势力复辟，为从社会主义社会胜利地过渡到共产主义社会开辟道路。中国人民和中国共产党的强大和所取得的成就，对于世界人民革命运动产生巨大的影响。”“中国是最坚强的革命堡垒，是世界革命人民和被压迫民族的最忠实、最可靠的朋友。因此，同中国人民并肩作战，保卫人民中国不受帝、修、反的破坏，是世界革命人民包括我们泰国人民在内的一项义务。”
    毛主席总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，发动亿万群众，进行了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从而解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命和如何进行革命的问题，解决了防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践的问题，这是使中国共产党和国家永不变色的可靠保证。
    毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命为全世界革命人民作出了光辉的榜样。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，为马克思列宁主义的理论宝库和世界共产主义运动作出了伟大的贡献。毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上的第三个伟大的里程碑。
    毛主席在领导无产阶级文化大革命运动中，充分依靠群众，充分相信群众，充分发动群众，尊重群众首创精神。在文化大革命中，中国人民享受了最广泛的民主，如大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大批判。集中目标，集中火力，向中国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们彻底批透、批臭。
    毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的可靠保卫者和强大支柱。
    当前中国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。广大的革命群众紧跟毛泽东主席的伟大战略部署，开展了群众性的革命大批判。革命的大批判推动了革命的大联合，以便把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。目前，两条路线、两条道路斗争已进入决战阶段。各条战线上的无产阶级革命派正在紧跟毛泽东主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，克服派性，加强党性，实现和巩固革命大联合，团结一致地摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，争取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    广大无产阶级革命派在夺中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，还夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，进行自我革命，改造世界观，使自己成为一个彻底的革命者。
    中国广大革命群众响应毛泽东主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，在建设社会主义的事业中获得了辉煌成就。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命响彻云霄的凯歌，使得以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及世界上一切反动派惊恐万状，胆战心惊，因为他们已经看到自己的末日日益迫近了。但是，全世界人民无不欢欣鼓舞地欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    如同全世界革命人民一样，泰国人民看到社会主义中国保证不改变颜色，成为世界革命强大的基地而增强了斗争信心，得到了巨大鼓舞。尽管帝国主义、现代修正主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团使劲地开动所有宣传机器，用尽一切方法来诬蔑、攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，企图缩小它的影响。但是，这一切都是徒劳的。在泰国共产党领导下，泰国人民曾经坚决抵制过苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义和中国赫鲁晓夫的“议会道路”，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毅然选择了武装夺取政权的道路；拿起武器反对美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后在全国范围内夺取政权。现在我们更加坚定不移地坚持毛泽东思想所指引的这条完全正确的道路。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，使泰国革命者和爱国者更深刻地认识到：毛泽东思想是战无不胜的强大的思想武器。毛主席的伟大形象和崇高威望日益深入革命群众的内心，特别是深入泰国人民武装力量的战士的内心。在泰国共产党的领导下，活学活用毛主席著作的战士日益增多。毛泽东主席的著作给予泰国人民武装力量干部和战士以巨大的力量，培养和教育他们成为不怕苦，不怕死的好战士。
    毛泽东主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》和《毛主席语录》是所有战士最锐利的思想武器。在缺乏书籍的条件下，战士和群众就收听北京电台泰语广播，记下口播的毛主席著作，然后背诵学习，学后就用。当遭受敌人残酷镇压，房屋被烧毁，亲友被惨杀，群众正处在最艰苦的时刻，毛主席的一段语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”给群众以莫大的鼓舞。在最困难的时候，毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”又鼓舞战士和群众的士气，使他们满怀信心和革命豪情坚持战斗。在战斗中，人民武装力量机动灵活地运用毛泽东主席的军事思想，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    让帝、修、反在全世界人民的革命风暴面前和中国无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中去哭泣，去发抖吧！全世界革命人民，包括泰国人民在内，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利的鼓舞下，将以豪迈的步伐走向光辉灿烂的未来！
