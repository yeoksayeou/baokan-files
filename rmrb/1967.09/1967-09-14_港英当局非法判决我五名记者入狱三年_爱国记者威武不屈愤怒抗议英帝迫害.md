The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong today, under the pretext of fabricated "charges," brazenly handed down an illegal "sentence" of three years in prison to five patriotic journalists. Among them are Ro Yuhe of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, Huang Yilu of the Wen Wei Po, Wang Ning of the Ta Kung Pao, Chen Zifeng of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and Wu Zaicheng of the Jing Bao. This is another serious provocation by the British authorities in Hong Kong against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China.

During the illegal "trial" of the five patriotic journalists, the British fascist authorities also brutally beat and illegally arrested Li Ruowen and Liang Shuhua of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, and Zhang Shufen of the Ta Kung Pao, and handed down an illegal "sentence" of 14 days in prison to each of them. That same morning, the Hong Kong police also beat and illegally arrested Shao Ganliang of the Ta Kung Pao outside the "courtroom."

Ro Yuhe, Huang Yilu, Wang Ning, Chen Zifeng, and Wu Zaicheng were abducted by the British fascist authorities on July 29 while conducting interviews in the Kowloon Heung To district. The British authorities had planned to persecute them politically, shamelessly fabricating charges of "participating in intimidating assemblies," "making inflammatory speeches," and "hiding inflammatory slogans." They subjected them to multiple illegal "interrogations" and a seven-day illegal "trial," deliberately delaying the "sentencing" and unreasonably detaining them for a total of 45 days.

Throughout the illegal detention and "trial," Ro Yuhe and the other four journalists stood firm, engaging in a head-on struggle with the enemy and displaying the heroic spirit of the Chinese people. The journalists expressed their indignation, exposing the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong and strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the British authorities in persecuting patriotic journalists.

In the afternoon of the 13th, when the British "judge" handed down the illegal "sentence," Ro Yuhe, Huang Yilu, Wang Ning, Chen Zifeng, and Wu Zaicheng all defiantly protested the political persecution by British imperialism, declaring that the enemy's illegal "sentence" was null and void.

    港英当局非法判决我五名记者入狱三年
    爱国记者威武不屈愤怒抗议英帝迫害
    据新华社香港十三日电　港英法西斯当局今天以莫须有的“罪名”悍然非法“判决”五名爱国记者入狱三年，其中有新华社香港分社记者罗玉和、《文汇报》记者黄一溜、《大公报》记者王宁、《香港商报》记者陈子峰、《晶报》记者吴在城。这是港英当局对香港爱国同胞和七亿中国人民的又一次严重挑衅。
    港英法西斯当局在对我五名爱国记者进行非法“判决”时，还在“法庭”内野蛮毒打和非法逮捕了新华社香港分社工作人员李若文、梁淑荷和《大公报》工作人员张淑芬，并且非法“判决”她们三人各入狱十四天。当天上午，港英警察还在“法庭”门外毒打和非法逮捕了《大公报》工作人员邵干鎏。
    罗玉和、黄一溜、王宁、陈子峰、吴在城等五人是七月二十九日在九龙横头磡区进行采访工作时被港英法西斯当局非法绑架的。港英蓄谋对他们进行政治迫害，无耻地捏造了所谓“参加恐吓性集会”、“发表煽动性言论”、“藏有煽动性标语”等荒诞“罪名”，对他们进行了多次非法“提讯”和长达七天的非法“审讯”，并故意拖延“判决”，无理扣押时间长达四十五天。
    在整个非法扣押和非法“审讯”过程中，罗玉和等五人大义凛然，与敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，表现了中华儿女的英雄气概。记者们满腔愤怒地揭露了港英当局的法西斯暴行，强烈谴责港英当局迫害爱国新闻工作者的滔天罪行。
    十三日下午，当港英“法官”进行非法“判决”时，罗玉和、黄一溜、王宁、陈子峰、吴在城都威武不屈的强烈抗议港英帝国主义的政治迫害，宣告敌人的非法“判决”一概无效。
