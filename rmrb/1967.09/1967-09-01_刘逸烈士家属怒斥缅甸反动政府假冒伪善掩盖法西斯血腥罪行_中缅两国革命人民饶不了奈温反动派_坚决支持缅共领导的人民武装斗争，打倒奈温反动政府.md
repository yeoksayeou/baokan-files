According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 31st, Liu Yaqin, the wife of the martyred Red Aid Worker Liu Yi, expressed her indignation upon learning of the so-called "condolences to the family of the late Mr. Liu Yi" from the Myanmar reactionary government. She told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the Ne Win reactionary government, in order to divert attention from class struggles at home, has stirred up a wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, orchestrating a series of horrifying fascist atrocities. My relative, Liu Yi, was brutally murdered in this series of savage fascist acts and died a heroic death. The Ne Win reactionary government attempts to turn the murder of Chinese expert Liu Yi, a shocking political event of global significance, into a mere accidental and ordinary legal case. This is intolerable! The Ne Win reactionary government not only owes a blood debt to the great people of China but also to the revolutionary people of the world! This blood debt cannot be settled with a few words of regret or a few lousy dollars.

Liu Yi was a great internationalist warrior nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. He sacrificed his blood and life to defend the dignity of his country and the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. For this blood crime, the great Chinese people will not forgive you, and neither will the Burmese people and the revolutionary people of the world!

Liu Yi went to Myanmar to work under the economic aid agreement between the two countries, commissioned by the Chinese people. He held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always worked at the forefront, endured hardships first, and blended in with the Burmese workers. However, the Ne Win reactionary government murdered this Chinese expert, who was regarded as a close friend by the Burmese working people. This clearly shows that you are a bunch of the most savage, brutal, and shameless fascist thugs! You have reached the height of madness, and the principles of Sino-Burmese relations have been trampled upon to such an extent! In your telegram, you talk about how "the clauses regarding the services of Chinese experts and technicians in Myanmar have not specifically stipulated how to handle such incidents." This is utterly absurd. Chinese experts and technicians went to your country entirely based on the agreement to aid the Burmese people, not to be employed by you, and certainly not to be brutally murdered by you. Therefore, in the clauses regarding the services of our experts and technicians, there is no need to add a condition stating what to do if a Chinese expert is murdered. You bring this up in your telegram, which only shows that you are at your wits' end and pathetic to the extreme!

The brutal murder of my aid worker to Myanmar, Liu Yi, and the savage massacre of many patriotic overseas Chinese by you are heinous crimes that cannot be forgiven by the Chinese people. Your crimes are also inciting strong condemnation from the revolutionary people of the world. To evade responsibility and deceive the Burmese people and the world's fair public opinion, you hypocritically express your willingness to offer some money "to condole the family of the late Mr. Liu Yi." You are simply dreaming! Do you think that by spending a few lousy dollars, you can silence us? Do you think that by spending a few lousy dollars, you can wash away the bloodstains on your hands? Listen up: The Chinese people, armed with the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, will not fall for your tricks. You think you can buy the dignity of our great motherland with money? You think you can stop us from exposing your fascist nature with money? This is sheer fantasy and stupidity! Even more despicable is that you dare to talk about "business transactions" and make a deal out of the condolences for Martyr Liu Yi. This is the greatest insult to the martyrs and the greatest insult to the great Chinese people, which is absolutely unacceptable!

In your telegram, you boast about "traditional friendship between the two countries," attempting to further deceive the Burmese people and the world's fair public opinion and escape responsibility. This is truly shameful! The "traditional friendship between the two countries" has long been destroyed by you, and who doesn't know that? The Chinese government's five solemn demands must be fully met, and not a single one can be missed! You must admit your guilt, severely punish the culprits, and stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities! Trying to cover it up and slip away easily is even more unacceptable!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests and bravely marched ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their bloodstained path!" The blood of Martyr Liu Yi was not shed in vain. His heroic sacrifice has ignited greater hatred among the Chinese and Burmese peoples towards the Ne Win reactionary government. As a relative and comrade of Martyr Liu Yi, I firmly support the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party, and I call for the overthrow of the Ne Win reactionary government!

　　刘逸烈士家属怒斥缅甸反动政府假冒伪善掩盖法西斯血腥罪行
　　中缅两国革命人民饶不了奈温反动派
　　坚决支持缅共领导的人民武装斗争，打倒奈温反动政府
    据新华社三十一日讯  红色援外战士刘逸烈士的妻子刘亚芸同志，在得知缅甸反动政府所谓“抚恤已故的刘逸先生的家属”的来照之后，义愤填膺。她向新华社记者发表谈话指出，奈温反动政府为了转移国内阶级斗争的视线，掀起了反华排华的妖风狂潮，策划了一系列骇人听闻的法西斯暴行。我的亲人刘逸同志，就是在这一系列野蛮的法西斯暴行中，惨遭杀害，壮烈牺牲的。奈温反动政府阴谋把杀害中国专家刘逸同志的这一世界上骇人听闻的严重政治事件，化作一个偶然的、普通的司法案件，是可忍，孰不可忍？奈温反动政府不仅对伟大的七亿中国人民欠下了一笔血债，而且对世界革命人民欠下了一笔血债！对于这笔血债，决不是可以由你们轻描淡写地说上几声“遗憾”就能了事的，也决不是可以由你们出几个臭钱来还清的。刘逸同志是毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的伟大的国际主义战士。他为捍卫祖国的尊严，为中缅人民之间的友谊，贡献出了自己的鲜血和生命。对于你们的这一血腥罪行，伟大的中国人民饶恕不了你们，缅甸人民和全世界革命人民也饶恕不了你们！
    刘逸同志是根据中缅两国的经济援助协定，受了中国人民的委托，去缅甸工作的。他高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处工作在前，吃苦在先，和缅甸的民工们打成了一片。然而，奈温反动政府竟把这个被缅甸劳动人民视作亲人的中国专家杀害，这不正好说明了你们是一伙最野蛮、最残暴、最无耻的法西斯暴徒吗！你们丧心病狂到了极点，中缅两国关系的准则被你们践踏到何等的地步！你们在来照中，说什么“关于中国在缅甸的专家和技术人员服务的条款并未作具体规定如何处理此类事件”，这实在是太荒唐了。中国专家和技术人员到你们国家来，完全是根据协定来援助缅甸人民的，并不是受你们雇佣，更不是来被你们野蛮杀害的。因此，在签订关于我国专家和技术人员服务的条款中，根本无需加上中国专家如遭杀害，应作如何规定这一条。你们在来照中把这一点也搬出来，这只能说明你们黔驴技穷，可悲到极点了！
    我援缅专家刘逸同志被你们野蛮杀害，广大爱国华侨被你们残酷屠杀，这是对中国人民犯下了不可饶恕的滔天罪行。你们的这一罪行，也正在激起全世界革命人民对你们的强力声讨。为了逃避罪责，为了欺骗缅甸人民和世界公正舆论，你们假惺惺地表示愿意拿出几个钱，“供抚恤已故刘逸先生的家属。”你们简直是白日作梦！你们以为只要花上这么几个臭钱就能封住我们的嘴？你们以为只要花上这么几个臭钱就能洗掉沾满了你们双手的血迹？竖起你们的狗耳听着：用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不吃你们这一套的。你们企图以金钱来收买我们伟大祖国的尊严，你们企图以金钱来制止我们对你们的法西斯本质的无情揭露，这完全是痴心妄想，愚蠢极了！更可恨的是，你们竟然在对刘逸烈士的抚恤问题上，大讲“交易经”，大作起买卖，这是对死难烈士的最大污辱，这是对伟大的中国人民的最大污辱，是绝对不能容忍的！
    在来照中，你们侈谈“两国传统友谊”，企图更进一步欺骗缅甸人民和世界公正舆论，逃脱罪责，实在可耻！“两国传统友谊”早已被你们破坏不堪，这谁个不知道？中国政府的五项严正要求，你们必须一一照办，缺一项也不行！你们必须低头认罪，必须严惩凶手，必须停止一切反华排华活动！企图蒙混过关，轻易地滑过去，这更不行！
    毛主席教导我们说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”刘逸烈士的鲜血没有白流。他的壮烈牺牲激起了中缅人民对奈温反动政府更大的仇恨。作为刘逸烈士的亲人和战友，我最坚决地支持由缅甸共产党领导的、正在胜利发展着的缅甸人民革命武装斗争，打倒奈温反动政府！
