Japanese progressive mass organizations' leaders strongly condemn Sato's reactionary government's anti-China crimes. Whoever opposes China is the enemy of the world's revolutionary people. The Japanese people will surely rise up to thoroughly smash the anti-China plots of the Sato government and the Japanese revisionists.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, the East Asia News Agency reported: Leaders of Japanese progressive mass organizations spoke to reporters from the East Asia News Agency, strongly condemning the anti-China crimes of the Sato reactionary government, and expressed their determination to fight to the end to overthrow the Sato government.

The General Secretary of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity, Banji Shosaku, pointed out that the Sato government can absolutely not destroy the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. Their anti-China plots will surely be thoroughly smashed by the peoples of Japan and China. Banji said that Sato's recent "visit" to Taiwan and the violence against the staff of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Tokyo and Chinese journalists in Japan were done under the direction of U.S. imperialism and in collusion with the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon Miyamoto.

After exposing Sato's stupid anti-China plots, Banji pointed out: "This does not show their strength but rather their weakness. It shows how they fear the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and how they fear the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa. It shows how they are terrified of the growth of revolutionary forces in Japan." Banji said, we firmly oppose Sato's reactionary policies of anti-China, anti-revolution, and anti-people. The revolutionary people of Japan will always stand on the side of the Chinese people. We will fight to the end to overthrow the Sato government. Banji emphasized: We are in the great era of Mao Zedong. No matter how hard the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries struggle, the final victory is ours.

The principal of the Osaka China-Japan Friendship Academy, Otsuka Yuzuo, said, I want to issue a stern warning to the Sato government, which colludes with the Chiang Kai-shek gang and commits fascist violence against Chinese personnel in Japan: The 700 million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not to be trifled with. Whoever underestimates the great power of the peoples of Japan and China will surely meet with self-destruction.

The General Secretary of the Japanese Federation of Publishers and Booksellers Unions, Iioka Kunihiro, pointed out: "Sato Eisaku has taken up his blood-stained big knife again, acting on the orders of U.S. imperialism and serving as a vanguard for the invasion of China and various Asian countries." Iioka said: "If Sato colludes with the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists to invade China, the Japanese people will surely rise up to thoroughly defeat them."

Iioka strongly condemned the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon Miyamoto for openly following the Soviet revisionists and colluding with the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in their anti-China activities. Iioka pointed out that the broad masses of the Japanese people are increasingly seeing through the counter-revolutionary ugly face of the Japanese revisionist group, and their plots will surely end in failure.

The secretary-general of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch, Koya Shosaku, said in great indignation, "Sato Eisaku and many of his ministers have recently made a series of 'visits' to South Korea, the Soviet Union, Taiwan, and will soon go to many places in Southeast Asia, which is completely in accordance with the U.S. arrangements, and is a planned activity to strengthen the anti-China encirclement. This is absolutely unacceptable. We must organize and fight to thoroughly smash all their plots."

Tokyo Federation of Youth and Students for China, Tsuchiya Kyuuichi, said, just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is continuously achieving new victories, U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their running dogs have launched an international anti-China wave. The recent anti-China violence initiated by the Sato reactionary government is one of its components.

Tsuchiya said, under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the new China has grown up and is the base of world revolution. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong thought and engages in anti-China activities is the enemy of the world's revolutionary people.

    日本进步群众团体领导人强烈谴责佐藤反动政府的反华罪行
    谁反华谁就是世界革命人民的公敌
    日本人民必将奋起彻底粉碎佐藤政府和日修的反华阴谋
    据新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本进步群众团体领导人向东方通讯社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责佐藤反动政府的反华罪行，表示要为打倒佐藤政府而斗争到底。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会事务局长板井庄作指出，佐藤政府绝对破坏不了日中两国人民的友谊，它们的反华阴谋必将被日中两国人民彻底粉碎。板井说，佐藤最近“访问”台湾，又对中国廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所的驻日人员和中国驻日记者等施加暴行，是在美帝国主义的指挥棒下干出来的，也是在苏修和日共宫本修正主义集团的共谋之下进行的。
    板井揭露了佐藤愚蠢的反华阴谋之后指出：“这件事并不表明他们的强大，恰恰表明了他们的虚弱，表明了他们是怎样害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命，怎样害怕亚非各国人民的斗争，对于日本革命势力的成长是怎样怕得要死。”板井说，我们坚决反对佐藤的反华、反革命、反人民的反动政策。日本的革命人民永远站在中国人民一边。我们要为打倒佐藤政府而斗争到底。板井强调说：我们正处在伟大的毛泽东时代。不管帝国主义和各国反动派怎样挣扎，最后胜利是属于我们的。
    大阪日中学院院长大塚有章说，我要向勾结蒋介石匪帮、制造殴打中国驻日工作人员法西斯暴行的佐藤政府，提出严正的警告：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，不是好惹的。谁要是轻视日中两国人民的伟大力量，就必然是自取灭亡。
    日本出版工会协议会总书记饭冈邦辅指出：“佐藤荣作又拿起沾满鲜血的大刀上阵了，他秉承美帝国主义的意旨，充当侵略中国和亚洲各国的马前卒。”饭冈说：“如果佐藤勾结美帝和苏修对中国进行侵略的话，日本人民一定会站起来彻底打倒他们。”
    饭冈强烈谴责日共宫本修正主义集团公开追随苏修，和美帝、日本反动派同流合污，在反华活动中大打出手。饭冈指出，广大的日本人民越来越看清了日修集团的反革命的丑恶嘴脸，它们的阴谋必定以失败而告终。
    日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部理事长古谷庄一郎极为愤慨地说，“佐藤荣作和他的许多大臣，最近一连串地‘访问’南朝鲜、苏联、台湾，不久还要到东南亚许多地方活动，这完全是按照美帝的部署，有计划地加强反华包围圈的阴谋活动。”古谷庄一郎说，佐藤政府和日共修正主义集团企图破坏日中人民的友谊，这是绝对不能得逞的。我们要组织起来投入战斗，彻底粉碎他们的一切阴谋。
    东京工会青年活动家土屋恭一说，正当中国无产阶级文化大革命不断取得新胜利的时候，美帝、苏修及其走狗又掀起一个国际范围的反华浪潮。佐藤反动政府最近挑起的反华暴行事件，就是其中的一个组成部分。
    土屋说，在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下成长起来的新中国，是世界革命的根据地。谁反对毛泽东思想和搞反华活动，谁就是世界革命人民的公敌。
