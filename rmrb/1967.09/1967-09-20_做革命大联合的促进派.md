In the midst of the revolutionary criticism, promoting, consolidating, and developing the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and pushing forward the struggle-criticism-transformation in one's own department or unit, is the key link to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat today, and it is also where the greatest revolutionary interests lie.

Some of our comrades often consciously or unconsciously deviate from the direction of the struggle. One of the reasons is that sectarianism and factionalism are at work. These comrades cling to their own little hilltop and do not put revolutionary interests first, but rather the interests of their small group. They say things like "only I am revolutionary," and accuse others of being "hypocritical," even holding onto mistakes that others have already admitted and corrected, always trying to bring others down. If they want to unite, they must listen to "me" and agree to the conditions "I" propose. Otherwise, they say there is "no common language" and "no conditions for unity." These wrong thoughts are serious obstacles to achieving revolutionary great unity. If revolutionary great unity is not achieved, revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in one's own unit will not be successful, and the struggle to promote production will also be seriously affected.

True proletarian revolutionaries should be promoters of revolutionary great unity, should prioritize revolutionary interests, and consciously struggle against the tendencies of sectarianism and factionalism. We must always think about the affairs of 700 million people, always think about the interests of the people of the whole country and the world, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Only by always keeping this in mind can we correctly handle and resolve various problems encountered in achieving revolutionary great unity, and promote and develop revolutionary great unity.

    做革命大联合的促进派
    在革命的大批判中，促进、巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，推动本部门、本单位的斗批改，这是今天巩固无产阶级专政的中心环节，也是最大的革命利益所在。
    我们有些同志常常自觉或不自觉地离开斗争大方向，其原因之一是小团体主义、山头主义在作怪。这些同志死抱着自己的小山头不放，不是把革命利益放在第一位，而是小团体的利益第一。什么“唯我是革命的”，说别人是“阳奉阴违”，甚至抓住人家已经承认、改正了的错误不放，总想把人家攻垮。如果要联合的话，也得听“我”的，答应“我”提出的条件。否则，就“没有共同语言”、“没有联合条件”。这些错误思想是当前实现革命大联合的严重障碍。革命的大联合搞不好，革命的大批判、本单位的斗批改也搞不好，抓革命，促生产也会受到严重影响。
    真正的无产阶级革命派应该做革命大联合的促进派，应该以革命利益为重，自觉地和小团体主义、山头主义的思想倾向作斗争。我们一定要经常想到七亿人民的大事，一定要经常想到全国人民、世界人民的利益，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。只有经常想到这一点，才能正确对待和处理革命大联合中所遇到的种种问题，促进和发展革命的大联合。
