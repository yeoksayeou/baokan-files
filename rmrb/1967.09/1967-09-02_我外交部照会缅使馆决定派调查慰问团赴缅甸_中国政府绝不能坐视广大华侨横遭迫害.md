	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Burmese Embassy on September 1st that it has decided to send an investigation and condolence mission to Burma. The Chinese government absolutely cannot stand idly by while the vast number of overseas Chinese are being persecuted.

	New China News Agency, September 1st: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Burmese Embassy in China on September 1st, firmly stating that the Chinese government absolutely cannot stand idly by while the vast number of overseas Chinese are being persecuted.

	The notification informed the Burmese reactionary government: "Given that the vast number of overseas Chinese in Burma are currently suffering under a white terror, many of the deceased have not been properly buried, many are still illegally detained and subjected to severe interrogations, countless people are displaced and homeless, and many are destitute and without means of livelihood, the Chinese government, out of concern for the vast number of overseas Chinese and to protect their legitimate rights from being infringed upon, has decided to send a delegation from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China. Representing the Chinese government and people, the delegation will bring relief supplies to Burma in mid-September to conduct investigations and offer condolences. The Chinese government demands that the Burmese government respond promptly and make the necessary arrangements."

	The notification states: "Over the past two months, the Chinese government has, on multiple occasions, strongly protested to the Burmese government regarding the large-scale savage persecution of overseas Chinese, urgently and strongly demanding that the Burmese government immediately take effective measures to stop the persecution of overseas Chinese, ensure the safety of their lives and property, release detained overseas Chinese, severely punish the instigators and perpetrators of the persecution of overseas Chinese, compensate the families of the victims, and compensate for all losses suffered by overseas Chinese. The Chinese government also demanded that the Chinese Embassy send personnel to investigate the persecution of overseas Chinese and that Chinese civilian aircraft be used to repatriate seriously injured overseas Chinese for treatment, among other things. It is extremely infuriating that the Ne Win reactionary government not only unreasonably rejected these legitimate and reasonable demands from the Chinese government, making various excuses and attempting to shirk responsibility for this blood debt; but also, with even greater impunity, carried out even larger-scale persecutions of overseas Chinese nationwide. Recently, they even publicly executed Liu Yingchao, a patriotic overseas Chinese leader in Burma and the chairman of the Burma Overseas Chinese Workers' Union, in prison. At the same time, they threatened to confiscate relief supplies sent by the Chinese government to Burma for overseas Chinese, attempting to cut off the lifeline of the suffering overseas Chinese."

	The notification states: "The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterates the aforementioned serious demands of the Chinese government and the five demands made by the Chinese Embassy regarding the Liu Yingchao incident."

　　我外交部照会缅使馆决定派调查慰问团赴缅甸
    中国政府绝不能坐视广大华侨横遭迫害
    新华社一日讯　中国外交部一日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，再次坚决表示，中国政府绝不能坐视广大华侨横遭迫害。
    照会通知缅甸反动政府：“鉴于目前缅甸广大华侨正处在水深火热的白色恐怖中，他们当中很多死者至今不得安葬，不少人仍被非法关押遭受严刑审讯，无数人流离失所，无家可归，生活无着，中国政府出于对广大华侨的关怀，维护华侨的正当权益不受侵犯，决定派遣一个由中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会组成的调查慰问团，代表中国政府和中国人民携带救济物品于九月中旬前往缅甸进行调查慰问。中国政府要求缅甸政府迅速答复，并作出安排。”
    照会说：“两个多月来，中国政府曾就缅甸反动政府大规模野蛮地迫害华侨事，多次向缅甸政府提出最紧急最强烈的抗议，严正要求缅甸政府立即采取有效措施，停止迫害华侨，切实保证华侨生命财产的安全，释放被捕华侨，严惩迫害华侨的主使者和凶手，抚恤受害华侨家属，赔偿华侨一切损失，并要求由中国大使馆派人调查华侨受迫害情况，以中国民航班机接运重伤华侨回国治疗等等。令人十分愤慨的是，奈温反动政府不但无理拒绝中国政府这些正当合理的要求，多方狡辩，妄图推卸罪责，赖掉这笔血债；而且更加肆无忌惮地在全国范围内，对华侨进行更大规模的迫害，最近又公然在狱中杀害中国旅缅爱国侨领、缅甸华侨工人联合会主席刘应超。同时竟然来照威胁说要没收中国政府运往缅甸救济华侨的物品，企图断绝受难华侨的生路。”
    照会说：“中国外交部重申中国政府的上述各项严正要求和中国大使馆就刘应超被害事件所提出的五项要求。”
