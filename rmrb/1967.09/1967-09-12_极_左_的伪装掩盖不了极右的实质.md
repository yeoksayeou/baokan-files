The revisionist Tao Zhu, from extreme right to extreme "left," has provided us with a living example of a counter-revolutionary two-faced character.

Tao Zhu has always been extremely right-wing, an old-fashioned right-opportunist. For a long time, he has viciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao, frantically opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the Party's leadership, distorted, attacked, and slandered the socialist system. He vigorously advocated the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," shamelessly praising the Chinese bourgeoisie for "building socialism," which is "the most beautiful bourgeoisie in the world"; he absurdly claimed that the "rich peasant economy can develop because there are fewer idle people"; he shouted that the "functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat should be weakened," and that "first and foremost, we should be lenient towards counter-revolutionaries," inciting them to "write reactionary slogans" and "speak reactionary words." He advocated the "four freedoms," pushed the "three autonomies and one contract," and spread the "wind of individual farming," paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. He exaggerated the "dark side" of our socialist society, portraying our socialist countryside as pitch-black, inciting ghosts and monsters to "have the courage" to expose "shortcomings," "difficulties," and "mistakes," launching a ferocious attack on the Party and socialism. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Tao Zhu infiltrated the Party Central Committee, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist document "February Outline" by Peng Zhen, denying that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power and counter-power, attempting to lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution astray. He stubbornly adhered to the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, collaborating with the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party to concoct and actively promote the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, sending out large numbers of work teams, implementing "work team dictatorship," arresting so-called "fake leftists, real rightists," enforcing bourgeois dictatorship, besieging revolutionary masses, suppressing revolutionary mass movements, and fiercely protecting a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, attempting to strangle the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He maliciously incited "you paste on me, I paste on you," "you expose me, I expose you," "you refute me, I refute you," stirring up masses to fight against masses, diverting the direction of the struggle. For a long time, Tao Zhu has stubbornly stood on the side of the bourgeois rightists, executing a reactionary line of the bourgeoisie that is anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

However, when millions of revolutionary masses rose up to denounce and criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, Tao Zhu suddenly made a 180-degree turn, changing from extreme right to extreme "left." He shouted loudly to "doubt everything," spreading the black wind of anarchism, inciting the masses to "universally attack," "everyone can expose," "every leader should be suspected," maliciously blurring the distinction between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, the proletarian leaders in power and the bourgeois leaders in power, greatly developing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to "strike a large area and protect a small clique."

The counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu is like a devil, sometimes extreme right, sometimes extreme "left," seemingly changing unpredictably and elusive. However, when this devil jumps from the extreme right to the extreme "left," people carefully observe and analyze, finally discovering that he is always consistent, always directing his spearhead against socialism, against the dictatorship of the proletariat, and against the proletarian headquarters. Thus, the true class face of this old rightist is fully exposed.

Leftists and rightists are determined by their class positions and political attitudes. Leftists are leftists, and rightists are rightists. False cannot become true. Pretending to be true and mixing in the crowd will not last long. So-called two-faced characters, in the end, are still one-faced, that is, counter-revolutionaries. The "left" with quotation marks is fake and deceiving, a rightist disguised in extreme "left" clothing.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise give people a false impression while hiding their true nature. However, since they want to be counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide their true nature."

"Doubt everything is correct," "I advocate a universal attack." This is the old rightist, great traitor Tao Zhu, at the moment when the black headquarters of the bourgeoisie is on the verge of collapse and the end is near, throwing out a genuine reactionary slogan of the bourgeoisie. It is his desperate struggle to continue stubbornly promoting the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, frantically opposing the revolutionary line of the proletariat, desperately protecting the bourgeois headquarters, and attacking the proletarian headquarters.

Tao Zhu, do you really want to "doubt everything"? Then why do you not doubt the great conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to usurp the Party and restore capitalism in our country? Is it not you, Tao Zhu, who once praised the Chinese Khrushchev to the skies, shamelessly praising him as "consistently correct," shouting loudly that whoever opposes him is anti-Party? Why do you not doubt the Chinese Khrushchev's stubborn promotion of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and his frantic suppression of revolutionary masses? Is it not you, Tao Zhu, who shouted for "work team dictatorship," to "shoot the leading bird," to arrest "fake leftists, real rightists," vigorously opposing the great democracy of the proletariat, opposing the great linkage of the revolution, and frantically suppressing the revolutionary mass movement? Why do you not doubt the reactionary propaganda preparation of the bourgeoisie's representatives to occupy the ideological and cultural front, to prepare for the restoration of capitalism? Is it not you, Tao Zhu, who praised the revisionist literary theories of the likes of Zhou Yang, praising them again and again, affirming them again and again, singing their praises again and again? Why do you never doubt your own consistent anti-Chairman Mao, anti-Party, anti-socialist words and deeds? Is it not you, Tao Zhu, who boasted that "you are following Chairman Mao closely," "basically a revolutionary of the proletariat"?

Tao Zhu, do you really want to "overthrow everything"? Then why do you try every means to protect a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and your pack of wolves and dogs everywhere? Why do you exonerate the Chinese Khrushchev from all blame, shamelessly protecting him, vigorously opposing Chairman Mao's great big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," covering up and overturning the criticism of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee against him? Why do you value your head full of reactionary thoughts of imperialism, feudalism, bourgeoisie, Chiang Kai-shek, and Khrushchev so highly, not overthrowing yourself, but frantically persecuting those who have posted big-character posters on you?

The decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (i.e., the "Sixteen Points") clearly states: "The focus of this movement is to criticize those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." This, Tao Zhu is very clear about. "Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party," this slogan, the newspapers have published it, the rebels have written it on big-character posters, shouted it in large and small meetings, this, Tao Zhu is also very clear about. It is under these circumstances that Tao Zhu maliciously incites people to "doubt everything," "overthrow everything." What does Tao Zhu really want to do? Who does he really want to doubt and overthrow? Isn't it clear?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." The objective law of class struggle is like this, either you overthrow me or I overthrow you. The so-called "doubt everything," "overthrow everything" is just a method of the bourgeoisie to carry out counter-revolution! The bourgeoisie not only never doubts itself, never overthrows itself, but also tries every means to consolidate its reactionary rule; similarly, the proletariat never doubts its political propositions, resolutely wants to eliminate capitalism. Tao Zhu's so-called "doubt everything," "overthrow everything," are all hypocritical, deceiving ghost talk. In a word, "doubt everything" is false, protecting oneself and keeping the bourgeois headquarters is true; "overthrow everything" is false, attempting to overthrow the proletarian headquarters is true!

Tao Zhu's set of reactionary slogans and tricks of "doubt everything," "overthrow everything" is not something new, just a bunch of junk picked up from the bourgeoisie and his revisionist ancestors. In the history of the international communist movement, whenever the revolutionary high tide comes, the proletariat launches a powerful attack on the bourgeoisie, the enemies of the proletariat always use various opportunist theories, from the right and also from the extreme "left," frantically opposing the proletariat, opposing the proletarian revolution, opposing the proletarian dictatorship. Bakunin, who was refuted by Marx, advocated this. The Machlo gang in the Soviet Union also played this trick when they opposed the newly born Soviet power. Khrushchev's opposition to the so-called "cult of personality," and the traitor Tito's various nonsense about the proletarian dictatorship, are all of this kind. The Chinese Khrushchev, when forging the experience of restoring capitalism in "Peach Garden," also openly advocated to "doubt boldly," "regardless of whether the cadres are good or bad, fight them a few times first." Tao Zhu and they are singing the same tune. His reactionary slogans of "doubt everything," "overthrow everything" are the counter-revolutionary program of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and all class enemies at home and abroad, attacking the proletarian headquarters, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Counter-revolutionaries are not so clumsy. Their strategies are very cunning and vicious. All revolutionary party members must not underestimate them, must not be complacent, must greatly raise the political vigilance of the people, in order to deal with and eliminate them." In this regard, Tao Zhu, this counter-revolutionary two-faced character, is a very good negative example for us. To thoroughly expose and criticize him will help to improve our ability to identify counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, help to improve our political vigilance.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved brilliant victories, the situation is good and getting better. The bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev is facing complete collapse. As the class struggle deepens, Tao Zhu-like two-faced characters will inevitably use more cunning and sinister methods to fight to the death with us. The "May 16" counter-revolutionary organization is the one that jumped out from the dark corners under this situation. They inherited the legacy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu, appearing in the guise of extreme "left," diverting the direction of the struggle, attacking the proletarian headquarters, attempting to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao from the extreme "left" side, and directing their spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army, destroying the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship.

However, no matter how cleverly the enemy disguises himself, as long as we use the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought, look at their attitude towards the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, look at whose class their slogans and actions benefit, look at whom they direct their spearhead at, look at their history, we can peel off their disguise, grab their black hands, and expose their true nature in broad daylight. Their conspiracies will never succeed, they will definitely not escape the fate of being overthrown like Tao Zhu.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out the revolutionary great criticism more deeply and widely, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, criticize them down and stink them up, do well in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our unit, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to seize the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, victory will definitely belong to the proletarian revolutionary faction!

    极“左”的伪装掩盖不了极右的实质		海军直属机关“红联总”
    修正主义者陶铸从极右到极“左”，为我们提供了一个活生生的反革命两面派的典型。
    陶铸一贯极端右倾，是一个老牌的右倾机会主义者。长期以来，他恶毒地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对党的领导，歪曲、攻击和诬蔑社会主义制度。他极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，无耻地吹捧中国的资产阶级“搞社会主义”，“是世界上最漂亮的资产阶级”；胡说“富农经济能发展，是因为吃闲饭的少”；叫嚷无产阶级“专政职能要减弱”，对反革命“首先要宽大”，鼓动他们“写反动标语”，“讲反动话”。他鼓吹“四大自由”，大搞“三自一包”，大刮“单干风”，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。他极力夸大我国社会主义社会的“黑暗面”，把我国社会主义的农村说得一团漆黑，煽动牛鬼蛇神“要有勇气”揭发“缺点”、“困难”、“错误”，向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻。无产阶级文化大革命开始，陶铸钻进党中央以后，他极力推销反革命修正主义分子彭真的《二月提纲》，否认无产阶级文化大革命是无产阶级同资产阶级夺权与反夺权的斗争，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命引上邪路。他顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派合伙炮制并积极推行了资产阶级反动路线，大派工作组，大搞“工作组专政”，大抓所谓“假左派，真右派”，实行资产阶级专政，围剿革命群众，镇压革命群众运动，死保党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图扼杀轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动。他恶意地煽动“你贴我、我贴你”，“你揭我、我揭你”，“你驳我、我驳你”，挑动群众斗群众，转移斗争大方向。陶铸长期以来顽固地站在资产阶级右派的立场上，执行着一条反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的资产阶级反动路线。
    可是，当千百万革命群众起来声讨和批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，陶铸忽然来了一个一百八十度的大转弯，由一贯极右，一变而以极“左”的面貌出现。他大喊大叫要“怀疑一切”，大刮无政府主义的黑风，煽动群众“普遍轰”、“谁都可以揭”、“每个领导都要被怀疑”，恶意抹煞无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部、无产阶级当权派和资产阶级当权派的本质区别，大大发展了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。
    反革命两面派陶铸活似一个魔鬼，忽而极右，忽而极“左”，右时右得可憎，“左”时“左”得出奇，似乎是变化莫测，不可捉摸。但是，当这个魔鬼从极右的一端到极“左”的一端跳来跳去的时候，人们留意地观察分析，终于发现他万变不离其宗，始终把矛头对着社会主义，对着无产阶级专政和无产阶级司令部。这样，他这个老右派的真实的阶级面貌就暴露无遗了。
    左派和右派是根据人们的阶级地位及其政治态度决定的。左派就是左派，右派就是右派，是假变不了真，以假冒真，混水摸鱼，是长不了的。所谓两面派，归根结底还是一面派，即反革命派。形“左”实右的“左”是带引号的，是假的、骗人的，是用极“左”的外衣掩盖起来的右派。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”
    “怀疑一切是正确的”，“我是主张普遍轰一下的”。这是老右派、大叛徒陶铸，在资产阶级黑司令部面临崩溃、末日即将到来的时刻，抛出的一个地地道道的资产阶级的反动口号，是他继续顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂反对无产阶级革命路线，死保资产阶级司令部，炮打无产阶级司令部所作的垂死挣扎。
    你陶铸果真是“怀疑一切”吗？那么，为什么你对中国的赫鲁晓夫在我国篡党篡政复辟资本主义的大阴谋却一点不怀疑呢？不正是你这个陶铸，曾经把中国的赫鲁晓夫捧上了天，无耻地吹捧他“一贯正确”，大嚷大叫谁反对他，谁就是反党吗！为什么你对中国的赫鲁晓夫顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂地镇压革命群众也是一点不怀疑呢？不正是你这个陶铸大叫要“工作组专政”，要“枪打出头鸟”，大抓“假左派，真右派”，竭力反对无产阶级的大民主，反对革命的大串连，疯狂镇压革命群众运动的吗！为什么你对资产阶级代表人物霸占思想文艺阵地，大搞资本主义复辟的舆论准备一点也不怀疑呢？不正是你这个陶铸，对周扬之流的反革命修正主义文艺理论，捧了又捧，肯定又肯定，歌颂又歌颂的吗！为什么你对自己的一贯反毛主席反党反社会主义的言行也从来不怀疑呢？不正是你这个陶铸吹嘘“自己是紧跟毛主席的”，“基本上是无产阶级革命家”的吗！
    你陶铸果真是要“打倒一切”吗？那么，为什么你千方百计地到处去包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和你的狐群狗党？为什么你对中国的赫鲁晓夫百般开脱罪责，卑鄙无耻地包庇他，竭力反对毛主席《炮打司令部》这张伟大的大字报，掩盖和推翻党的八届十一中全会对他的批判？你为什么把你那个装满了帝国主义、封建主义、资产阶级、蒋介石、赫鲁晓夫的反动思想大杂烩的臭脑袋看得如此宝贵，不把自己打倒，而对那些给你贴过大字报的人们进行疯狂的迫害？
    党的八届十一中全会通过的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》（即《十六条》）中明明白白写着：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”这一点，陶铸是清清楚楚的。“紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派”，这个口号，报纸上登了，造反派在大字报上写了，在大会小会上喊了，这一点，陶铸也是清清楚楚的。正是在这种情况下，陶铸却别有用心地煽动人们“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”。陶铸到底要干什么？他所要怀疑的、打倒的究竟是谁，难道不是一清二楚了吗！
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”阶级斗争的客观规律就是这样，不是你打倒我，就是我打倒你，所谓“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”只不过是资产阶级进行反革命的一种手法而已！资产阶级不仅从来不怀疑自己，不打倒自己，而且千方百计巩固自己的反动统治；同样，无产阶级也从来不怀疑自己的政治主张，坚决要消灭资本主义。陶铸的所谓“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”，统统是虚伪的、骗人的鬼话。说穿了，就是一句话，“怀疑一切”是假，保护自己，保住资产阶级司令部是真；“打倒一切”是假，妄图推翻无产阶级司令部是真！
    陶铸的这一套“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的反动口号和伎俩，并不是什么新鲜玩意，不过是从资产阶级和他的修正主义老祖宗那里拣来的破烂。在国际共产主义运动史上，每当革命高潮到来，无产阶级以不可阻挡之势向资产阶级发起猛力进攻的时候，无产阶级的敌人总是以各种机会主义的理论，从右的方面、也从极“左”的方面疯狂地反对无产阶级，反对无产阶级革命，反对无产阶级专政。被马克思驳得体无完肤的巴枯宁之流就是这样主张的。苏联的马赫洛匪帮在反对新生的苏维埃政权的时候也耍过这种鬼把戏。赫鲁晓夫的反对所谓“个人迷信”，以及叛徒铁托对无产阶级专政的种种胡言乱语，都是这一类货色。中国赫鲁晓夫在炮制复辟资本主义的“桃园经验”的时候，也公然鼓吹要“大胆怀疑”，“不论干部好坏，先斗他几次再说”。陶铸和他们唱的是一个调子，他的“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的反动口号，就是代表地富反坏右和国内外一切阶级敌人向无产阶级司令部发起进攻的反革命纲领，就是煽动一切反动分子炮打无产阶级司令部，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的黑号令。
    毛主席教导我们：“反革命分子不是那样笨拙的，他们的这些策略，是很狡猾很毒辣的。一切革命党人决不能轻视他们，决不能麻痹大意，必须大大提高人民的政治警惕性，才能对付和肃清他们。”在这方面，陶铸这个反革命两面派，就是我们的一个很好的反面教员。对他进行彻底的揭发批判，将有助于提高我们识别反革命两面派的能力，有助于提高我们的政治警惕性。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌的胜利，形势大好，越来越好。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部正面临着彻底的崩溃。阶级斗争的深入，陶铸式的两面派，必然会用更狡猾、更阴险的手法来同我们作拚死的斗争。“五·一六”这个反革命组织，就是在这种形势下从阴暗角落里跳出来的。他们继承了反革命修正主义分子陶铸的衣钵，以极“左”的面目出现，转移斗争大方向，炮打无产阶级司令部，妄想从极“左”的方面动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，并把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军，破坏无产阶级专政的强大支柱。
    但是，不管敌人伪装得多么巧妙，只要我们运用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜，看一看他们对待资产阶级和无产阶级的态度，看一看他们的口号和行动对哪一个阶级有利，看一看他们把斗争矛头指向谁，看一看他们的历史，就可以剥开他们的伪装，抓住他们的黑手，把他们的真相暴露在光天化日之下。他们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的，他们绝对逃不脱陶铸之流的覆灭命运。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，更深入、更广泛地开展革命的大批判，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透，批倒批臭，搞好本单位的斗批改，为保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而战斗！
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派！　（原载《解放军报》）
