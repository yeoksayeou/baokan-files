The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country faces an unprecedentedly good situation. Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on us to carry out a thorough criticism of the revolution, develop and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, promote production while carrying out the revolution, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and guard against sabotage by domestic and foreign class enemies. This is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The great victories of the people's revolutionary wars in our country have been achieved by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country have been achieved by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country over the past more than a year have also been achieved by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

To resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is to win victory. To deviate even slightly from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and great strategic deployment will cause the revolution to suffer setbacks and failures. The decades-long struggle of the Chinese revolution has repeatedly proved this unshakable truth.

To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must use Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to unify our thinking, actions, and steps, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment forward!

To closely follow means to act promptly and decisively, to move at the slightest signal. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we rush there.

To closely follow means to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions word for word and letter for letter, honestly and without the slightest deviation. We must carry out what we understand and also what we do not understand for the time being. We must carry out what is in accordance with our own ideas and also what is not in accordance with our own ideas. We must carry out what is in accordance with local interests and also what is not in accordance with local interests.

To closely follow means to use every possible means to overcome all difficulties, remove all interference, and ensure that Chairman Mao's instructions are carried out one hundred percent. Whatever does not conform to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, no matter where it comes from, must be firmly opposed, firmly resisted, and firmly stood up against. To defend and carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and realize Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.

We must protect Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment as we protect our eyes. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and guard against domestic and foreign class enemies who try to sow discord and fish in troubled waters. The counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must be firmly suppressed.

Comrades of the entire army, let us advance bravely under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core! Following Chairman Mao is victory!

　　紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，面临着空前大好的形势。我们伟大领袖毛主席号召我们，要搞好革命的大批判，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，开展拥军爱民运动，抓革命促生产，提高革命警惕，严防国内外阶级敌人破坏。这是毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席所制定的一切伟大战略部署，科学地反映了阶级斗争的客观规律，代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益，它是照耀我们革命事业胜利前进的灯塔。
    我国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，是按照毛主席的伟大战略部署取得的。
    我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，是按照毛主席的伟大战略部署取得的。
    一年多来我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，也是按照毛主席的伟大战略部署取得的。
    坚决地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是胜利，稍微背离了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和伟大战略部署，就会使革命遭到挫折和失败。中国革命几十年来的斗争实践，反复证明了这样一个颠扑不破的真理。
    我们要把无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行到底，就一定要用毛主席的伟大战略部署来统一思想，统一行动，统一步伐，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进！
    紧跟，就是要雷厉风行，闻风而动，一声令下，立即行动。毛主席指到那里，我们就奔向那里。
    紧跟，就是对毛主席指示要句句照办，字字照办，老老实实、不折不扣地照办。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行。合乎自己想法的要执行，不合自己想法的也要执行。符合局部利益的要执行，不符合局部利益的也要执行。
    紧跟，就是要想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，排除一切干扰，保证毛主席指示百分之百地实现。凡是不符合毛主席的伟大战略部署的东西，不管来自那一方面，都要坚决反对，坚决抵制，坚决顶住。为了保卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，实现毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，排除万难，去争取胜利。
    我们要象保护眼珠一样，保护毛主席的伟大战略部署。要保持高度的革命警惕性，严防国内外阶级敌人挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。对美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右的反革命破坏活动，必须坚决镇压。
    全军同志们，让我们在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，奋勇前进！跟着毛主席就是胜利！　（九月七日）
