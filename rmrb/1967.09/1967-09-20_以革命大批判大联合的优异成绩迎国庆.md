The capital's garrison troops and revolutionary masses of the proletariat held a grand rally to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's latest battle call. They will welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with outstanding achievements in revolutionary criticism and great unity.

Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi attended the meeting and encouraged everyone to seriously study the speech by Comrade Jiang Qing, making the capital a model of revolutionary unity.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on the 19th: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the capital, carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the PLA's land, sea, and air forces' leadership organs, as well as the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the capital's industrial and mining enterprises, suburban villages, universities, and secondary schools, gathered together today to hold a grand meeting to firmly respond to the latest battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. At the meeting, they unanimously expressed their determination to strictly follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unite as one, and do a good job in revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units. They will welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with the fastest actions and the best results.

This meeting was convened by the Beijing Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army. At the meeting, the broad masses of soldiers and officers who have forged deep revolutionary friendship in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, fully demonstrated the atmosphere of close unity, mutual reliance, mutual learning, and mutual assistance. They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Achieve new victories in revolutionary unity!" "Learn from the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital and forever be a model of loving the people!" "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army and forever be a model of supporting the army!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years live to our great leader Chairman Mao!"

Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He pointed out that doing a good job in revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the struggle-criticism-transformation of one's unit is the most important task at present. Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech on September 5 is the latest instruction and call from the proletarian headquarters led by our great leader Chairman Mao. We must study it seriously and carry it out actively. The troops in Beijing are troops under the direct leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They have made great contributions in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work. The left-support work of the Beijing Garrison Command is well done. The People's Liberation Army firmly supports the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat who resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and does not support division. This is completely correct. He called on the broad masses of soldiers and officers and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital to respond with concrete actions to the latest call of the proletarian headquarters led by our great leader Chairman Mao. He said that the capital should become a model of revolutionary unity.

Recently, the soldiers and officers of the capital's troops and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from various fronts have repeatedly and deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Comrade Jiang Qing's speech on September 5. A good situation of revolutionary unity has emerged. So far, more than 160 middle schools in the city have achieved revolutionary unity, and 107 middle schools have established revolutionary committees. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses from industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, and universities are now determined to achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity with the greatest resolve and the fastest actions. They are joyfully welcoming the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Today's meeting was held under this good situation.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Li Tianyou and Commander of the Air Force Wu Faxian both spoke at today's meeting. They called on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the various headquarters, military branches, and military academies of the PLA, as well as the broad masses of soldiers and officers carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks in Beijing, to firmly respond to the latest battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They should follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, further strengthen, consolidate, and develop the relationship of fish and water, flesh and blood between the military and the people. They should strongly support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital in deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, achieving revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and doing a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units. They should achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives of the Beijing Workers' Congress and the Beijing Peasants' Congress said at the meeting that on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, at the moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the proletarian headquarters led by our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a new battle order to us. This has enabled us to further clarify the current revolutionary situation and the direction of our struggle. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two hostile factions. This really speaks to our hearts. We must closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further do a good job in revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," further do a good job in supporting the army, and launch a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production. We will welcome the National Day with the latest achievements in revolution and production.

Representatives of the Beijing Higher Education Red Guards Association and the Beijing Middle School Red Guards Association firmly stated in their speeches that they would unconditionally carry out the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, quickly unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the capital present a new situation of great unity and great solidarity among the revolutionary masses before the National Day. They requested the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the three services to provide assistance and supervision, do a good job in the great unity of various revolutionary organizations before the National Day, and accept the inspection of our great leader Chairman Mao with concrete actions.

Commander of the Beijing Garrison Command Fu Chongbi presided over today's meeting. He, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison Command, thanked the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital and the leadership organs and brother units of the various military branches of the PLA for their support for the left-support work in the Beijing region. He also expressed that under any circumstances, they would firmly follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. He said, whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we support; whatever causes division, we firmly do not support. We must be vigilant and prevent all tricks and conspiracies of the domestic and foreign class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Leaders from the various headquarters and military branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the Beijing Garrison Command, attended today's meeting.

Those who attended today's meeting also included representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the army, navy, and air force, and responsible comrades from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, the Workers' Congress, the Peasants' Congress, the Higher Education Red Guards Association, and the Middle School Red Guards Association.
