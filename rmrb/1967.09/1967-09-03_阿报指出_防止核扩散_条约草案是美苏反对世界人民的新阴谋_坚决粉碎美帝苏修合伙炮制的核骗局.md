The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on August 26, stating that the draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" proposed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the 17-nation "disarmament" conference in Geneva on August 24 is a new conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism against the people of various countries. The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the draft is to shackle the hands and feet of the people and sovereign states of various countries, forcing them to submit to the will of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and to help U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism play the despicable role of international police.

The commentary said: Following the infamous Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed in Moscow, the leaders of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have been engaged in secret talks behind the scenes to find various ways and means to implement their conspiracy to maintain nuclear monopoly. The dealings between the U.S. and the Soviet Union reached their peak during the Johnson-Kosygin meeting in Glassboro. They determined further ways to implement the expansionist and colonial plans of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Glassboro and concocted new plans regarding nuclear weapons. Now, people have seen the results of this new betrayal by the Soviet revisionists.

The commentary said: The root cause of the current threat to international peace and security is not the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The real danger comes from the hegemonic and aggressive policies of the United States, with the support and assistance of the Soviet revisionists, who are the closest accomplices of U.S. imperialism. Faced with such a situation, the interests of the people of sovereign states require strengthening their national defense to counter all aggressors. The possession of nuclear weapons by peace-loving countries will reduce the possibility of nuclear threats and blackmail by the two "superpowers." This is why all the freedom-loving people of the world and all anti-imperialist progressive forces enthusiastically applaud the successful conduct of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests by the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China's possession of atomic weapons, missiles, and hydrogen bombs has shattered the hopes of the enemies of the people, revolution, and socialism, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, who sought to maintain and prolong their nuclear monopoly and use it to pressure and blackmail the people of various countries.

The commentary concluded by saying that the people of various countries will not be deceived by the new tricks of the imperialists and revisionists in Geneva.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on August 27, pointing out that the recent "escalation" of the war by the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam and their armed provocations against China are part of the joint plan of Johnson and Kosygin in Glassboro, and are also aimed at appeasing their tame lackeys in Asia.

The commentary said: The more frenziedly the governments of countries like India, Burma, and Indonesia attack China, the more the people of these countries rise up against their reactionary governments. It is in this context that imperialism and revisionism, while using their propaganda machines to attack China, Johnson and Kosygin have planned to escalate the aggression against the Vietnamese people and strengthen armed provocations against China.

The commentary pointed out: However, the imperialists and modern revisionists are reaping what they sow. Within a few days of the U.S. aggressors escalating the war, they were beaten black and blue. Their bandit attacks and shameless schemes have aroused greater anger and hatred among the people of various countries towards the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists, and have further strengthened the resolve of the people of various countries to bravely join the revolutionary struggle. The revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries will sweep away these scum of humanity from the face of the earth like a mighty storm.

　　阿报指出“防止核扩散”条约草案是美苏反对世界人民的新阴谋
　　坚决粉碎美帝苏修合伙炮制的核骗局
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八月二十六日发表评论说，美苏在二十四日举行的日内瓦十七国“裁军”会议上，提出了它们合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案，这是美帝和苏修反对各国人民的一个新阴谋。评论指出，草案的目的在于束缚各国人民和主权国家的手脚，强迫他们屈从美苏的意志，帮助美帝和苏修履行国际宪兵的可恶角色。
    评论说：继臭名远扬的莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约签订之后，美帝头子和苏修领导人不断在幕后进行秘密会谈，以便寻找不同的方式方法实现美苏维持核垄断的阴谋计划。美苏之间的交易在约翰逊—柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会晤期间达到了顶峰。他们在葛拉斯堡罗确定了彻底实现美苏扩张主义和殖民计划的进一步途径，并且炮制了核武器方面的新计划。现在人们看到了苏修这次新背叛的成果。
    评论说：当前威胁国际和平与安全的根源不是核武器的扩散。真正的危险来自在美帝最亲密的帮凶和伙伴苏联修正主义者支持和帮助下的美国霸权政策和侵略政策。面对这样的局势，各主权国家人民的利益要求加强他们的国防，以便回击一切侵略者。爱好和平的国家掌握了核武器将减少两个“超级大国”对他们进行核威胁和核讹诈的可能性。这就是全世界所有爱好自由的人民、一切反帝进步力量热烈欢呼中华人民共和国成功地进行原子爆炸和第一颗氢弹试验的原因。中华人民共和国掌握了原子武器、导弹和氢弹，粉碎了各国人民、革命和社会主义的敌人美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者妄图保持和延长他们的核垄断、借以对各国人民施加压力和讹诈的希望。
    评论最后说，各国人民不会被帝修在日内瓦的新伎俩所欺骗。
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》八月二十七日发表评论指出，美国侵略者最近在越南进行的新的战争“升级”和对中国的武装挑衅，是约翰逊、柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗策划的美苏共同计划的一个组成部分，同时也是为了安抚它们在亚洲的驯服走狗。
    评论说，印度、缅甸、印尼等国政府越是疯狂地反华，这些国家的人民反对本国反动政府的斗争就越高涨。正是在这种情况下，帝国主义、修正主义在使用宣传机器对中国进行攻击的同时，约翰逊和柯西金策划了对越南人民进行侵略“升级”和加强对中国的武装挑衅。
    评论指出，但是帝国主义者和现代修正主义者自作自受，自讨苦吃。美国侵略者在它进行新的战争“升级”的几天之内，就被碰得头破血流。他们的强盗袭击和无耻计划激起了各国人民对帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的更大愤怒和仇恨，更加增强了各国人民勇敢地投入革命斗争的决心。各国人民的革命斗争将象排山倒海的暴风巨浪一样把人类的这些渣滓从地球上扫除干净。
