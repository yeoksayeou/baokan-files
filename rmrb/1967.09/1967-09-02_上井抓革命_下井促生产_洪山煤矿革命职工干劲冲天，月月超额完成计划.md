	Editor's Note: Reports of increased coal production have come from the Hongshan, Wujing, and Donggou coal mines. We extend our warm congratulations to the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front for their achievements in implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production."

	Coal is the grain of industry. Striving to improve coal production is of great significance in ensuring the needs of industrial production, meeting the needs of urban and rural people's lives, and ensuring the victory of the Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

	All revolutionary workers on the coal industry front should, like the revolutionary workers of the Hongshan, Wujing, and Donggou coal mines, actively respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the workers on the coal industry front. They should firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote coal production. With the high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the Cultural Revolution and the high sense of responsibility as masters of the state, they should make their own contributions to the resolute completion of coal production tasks.

	Revolution Above Ground, Production Below Ground

	The revolutionary workers of Hongshan Coal Mine are full of enthusiasm, exceeding the plan every month.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on August 1, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers of Hongshan Coal Mine, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. They insist on revolution above ground and production below ground, making the revolution vigorous and production booming. Since the seizure of power, they have exceeded the state plan every month, and the entire mine presents a lively and prosperous situation.

	The broad proletarian revolutionary factions of Hongshan Coal Mine, in the struggle to expose, criticize, and fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the mine party, united more than 85% of the workers, achieving revolutionary great unity. They established the "Red Worker-Soldier Corps" and seized all power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the mine party on February 1. After seizing power, they raised the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, and used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They carried out deeper exposure and criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the mine party in terms of politics, ideology, and theory, further consolidating the revolutionary great unity. While firmly grasping the revolution, they always remember Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production." They insist on eight hours of production and use the surging enthusiasm released in the great criticism and struggle to production. In the first half of this year, the raw coal output completed 106.5% of the state plan, and the total advance meters completed 112.5% of the state plan. The raw coal output and total advance meters from July 1 to August 20 also exceeded the state plan.

	In the process of "grasp revolution, promote production," the soldiers of the "Red Worker-Soldier Corps" always insist on the eight-hour work system, making revolution in their spare time and saving time for revolution. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, in order to sabotage production, incited some deceived masses and cadres to create incidents and stir up arguments on the production front. The revolutionary faction of the "Red Worker-Soldier Corps," armed with Mao Zedong Thought, promptly carried out resolute criticism and struggle against these bad elements. At the same time, they persuaded and educated the deceived masses and cadres, explaining to them that different opinions can be discussed with facts and reasoning, but only in spare time, and they must not leave their posts to affect production.

    编者按：洪山、五井和东沟等煤矿，纷纷传来了煤炭增产的捷报。我们对煤炭工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工群众，贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针所取得的成就，表示热烈的祝贺。
    煤炭是工业的粮食。努力搞好煤炭生产，对于保证工业生产的需要，保证城乡人民生活的需要，保证无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的胜利进行，都有着极为重要的意义。
      煤炭工业战线广大革命职工，都应当象洪山、五井、东沟等煤矿的革命职工那样，积极响应中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组对煤炭工业战线职工的号召，狠抓革命，猛促煤炭生产，以无产阶级文化大革命所激发出来的高度的革命热情，以国家主人翁的高度责任感，为坚决完成煤炭生产任务作出自己的贡献。
　　上井抓革命　下井促生产
    洪山煤矿革命职工干劲冲天，月月超额完成计划
    据新华社济南一日电　山东淄博矿务局洪山煤矿无产阶级革命派和革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，坚持上井抓革命，下井促生产，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。自夺权以来，月月超额完成国家计划，全矿呈现出一片生气勃勃的大好形势。
    洪山煤矿广大无产阶级革命派，在向这个矿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争中，团结了百分之八十五以上的职工，实现了革命的大联合，成立了“红工兵团”，于二月一日夺了这个矿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切大权。夺权之后，他们更高地举起革命的批判大旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上对矿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开了更深入的揭发批判，进一步巩固了革命的大联合。在狠抓革命的同时，他们牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，始终坚持八小时生产，把在大批判、大斗争中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去。今年上半年，原煤产量完成了国家计划的百分之一百零六点五，掘进总进尺完成了国家计划的百分之一百一十二点五。七月一日至八月二十日的原煤产量和掘进总进尺，也都超额完成了国家计划。
    在“抓革命，促生产”中，“红工兵团”的战士们始终坚持八小时工作制，在业余闹革命，节约闹革命。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了破坏生产，曾挑动一些受蒙蔽的群众和干部，到生产岗位上制造事端，挑起争论。用毛泽东思想武装起来的“红工兵团”革命派及时对这些坏家伙进行了坚决的批判斗争。对受蒙蔽的群众和干部，同时进行了说服教育，向他们说明，对不同的观点可以摆事实、讲道理，进行辩论，但只能在业余时间进行，决不能离开岗位影响生产。
