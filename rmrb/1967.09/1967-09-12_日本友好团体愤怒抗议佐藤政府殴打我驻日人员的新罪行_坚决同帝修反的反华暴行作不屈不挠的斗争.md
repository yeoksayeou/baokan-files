Japanese friendly organizations angrily protest the new crime of the Sato government beating Chinese personnel in Japan and resolutely fight against the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary anti-China atrocities.

BEIJING, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: On the morning of the 10th, Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Okada Haruo, representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters Morioka Shinichiro, and representative of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity Sakamoto Tokumatsu, visited the Prime Minister's Office to meet with Sato government's Secretary-General Kimura. They strongly protested the Japanese reactionary government's dispatch of police, secret agents, and thugs to carry out fascist atrocities against the Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office and Chinese journalists in Tokyo on the 8th and 9th. They also demanded that the Sato government protect the Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office and the offices of Chinese journalists and workers in Japan.

Okada Haruo and Morioka Shinichiro listed evidence to prove that this serious anti-China atrocity was planned by the Japanese police authorities and immediately held the Sato government responsible.

In the face of facts, Sato government's Secretary-General Kimura not only did not admit his guilt but also engaged in sophistry and denial, claiming that "the reports received by the government do not match the facts (listed by the representatives)." Even more despicable, he even turned the tables, saying that the representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office, Wu Shudong, issued a statement condemning Sato's "visit" to Taiwan, "violating their purpose of staying in Japan." However, he admitted, "Wu Shudong's issued statement is the cause of a series of incidents," which exposed the Sato government's extreme fear and hatred of Wu Shudong's issued statement. For this, they planned to dispatch police and fascist thugs to carry out violent actions against Chinese personnel in Japan.

Vice Chairman Ito Takeo and Chairman Miyazaki Seiken of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, on the evening of the 9th, had a meeting with Takasaki Kahei of the Takasaki Office, demanding that he protest to the Sato government about the violence of the Japanese police and thugs.

BEIJING, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: The Standing Committee of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association issued a statement on the 11th, condemning the Sato government's dispatch of police and right-wing thugs to beat Chinese personnel of the Liaozhengzhi Office in Japan, Chinese journalists, and workers, and fully supporting the strong protest of the Liaozhengzhi Office's Tokyo Liaison Office to the Sato government regarding this incident.

The statement pointed out: "This anti-China fascist atrocity is part of the joint anti-China farce staged by the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, reactionaries of various countries, the Sato reactionary government, and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto. At the same time, it is a mad provocation and attack by the Sato government against us who are engaged in Japan-China friendly trade and the broad masses of the Japanese people."

The statement demands that the Sato government severely punish the police authorities and right-wing thug leaders who instigated this incident; apologize to the Chinese personnel and journalists in Japan; and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

The statement finally expresses: We will, with unyielding will, resolutely fight against the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Sato reactionary government, and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Miyamoto, who are intent on destroying the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, until we achieve final victory.

    日本友好团体愤怒抗议佐藤政府殴打我驻日人员的新罪行
    坚决同帝修反的反华暴行作不屈不挠的斗争
    新华社十日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本社会党国会议员冈田春夫、日中友好协会（正统）总部代表大森真一郎、亚非人民团结日本委员会代表坂本德松等人，十日上午到首相府会见佐藤政府的秘书长木村，就日本反动政府出动警察、特务和暴徒，在八日和九日连续向廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所和中国驻日记者施行法西斯暴行，提出强烈的抗议，并且要求佐藤政府保护廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所和中国驻日记者办公处及中国驻日工作人员的安全。
    冈田春夫和大森真一郎向木村列举事实证明，这一严重反华暴行，是日本警察当局一手策划的，并且当场追究佐藤政府的责任。
    佐藤政府的秘书长木村在事实面前不但不低头认罪，反而进行诡辩和抵赖，胡说什么“政府收到的报告同（各代表列举的）事实不相符合”。更为恶劣的是，他甚至倒打一耙，说什么廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表吴曙东发表声明谴责佐藤“访问”台湾，“违反他们驻在日本的目的”。但是，他供认，“吴曙东发表的声明是发生一系列事件的原因”，这就暴露了佐藤政府对于吴曙东发表的声明怕得要命，恨得要死，为此它就有计划地出动警察和法西斯暴徒对中国驻日人员施加暴力行动。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部副会长伊藤武雄和理事长宫崎世民等，在九日晚间曾经会见高碕事务所代表冈崎嘉平太，要求他就日本警察和暴徒的暴行向佐藤政府提出抗议。
    新华社十一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本国际贸易促进协会常任理事会，十一日发表声明，谴责日本佐藤政府出动警察和右翼暴徒，殴打中国廖承志办事处驻日人员、中国驻日记者和工作人员的法西斯暴行，并且全力支持廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所就此事件对佐藤政府提出的强烈抗议。
    声明指出：“这次反华法西斯暴行，是美帝、苏修、各国反动派和佐藤反动政府、宫本修正主义集团所上演的联合反华丑剧的一个组成部分。同时，也是佐藤政府对于我们从事日中友好贸易人士和广大日本人民的疯狂的挑衅和攻击。”
    声明要求佐藤政府严厉惩罚挑起这次事件的警察当局和右翼暴徒头目；向中国驻日工作人员和记者低头认罪；保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    声明最后表示：我们要以不屈不挠的意志，向蓄意破坏日中两国人民友谊的美帝、苏修、佐藤反动政府和日共宫本修正主义集团，进行坚决的斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
