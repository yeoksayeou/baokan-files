The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has, over the past year and more, won very great victories and achieved splendid results, presenting a very fine revolutionary situation.

This unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution has thoroughly swept away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and has widely popularized Mao Zedong Thought. This movement, from east to west and from north to south, has fully mobilized the hundreds of millions of people of our country, greatly promoting the ideological transformation of the hundreds of millions of people of our country. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "This movement is on a very large scale and has indeed roused the masses. It has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country."

This surging great revolution has exposed the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They have gone bankrupt and have been overthrown in the face of the awakening power of the people. Their dream of restoring capitalism on this piece of Chinese soil has been shattered by us. How gratifying this is!

Through this stormy mass struggle, a large number of new proletarian cadres have emerged. Through the test of fierce class struggle, a large number of good cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been discovered. This is a matter of great importance for ensuring the prosperity and development of our revolutionary cause and socialist construction. Through this mass criticism and help from below, many cadres who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, have been saved.

In the struggle to participate in and defend the great proletarian cultural revolution, the People's Liberation Army has undergone a new test, has been tempered and raised to a new level. At the same time, it has fully proved that the army created, personally led by the great commander Chairman Mao, and personally commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is unparalleled in the world, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is invincibly strong and reliable, is a great pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is a great wall defending the victorious advance of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

This revolutionary victory is a victory of the Chinese proletariat over the bourgeoisie, over the landlord class and all exploiting classes, and a victory over imperialism and modern revisionism. It is a great victory of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Our victory in 1949 was a great victory in seizing proletarian political power. This victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution is a great victory in defending and consolidating proletarian political power. This victory has, for the first time in theory and practice, correctly solved the major issue of how to carry out a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Of course, in such an unprecedented great revolution involving hundreds of millions of people, it is impossible not to pay some price, impossible not to have some shortcomings and errors, and impossible not to suffer some losses. However, as Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman, has correctly pointed out, in such an unprecedented great revolution, our losses are the smallest, smallest, smallest, while our achievements are the greatest, greatest, greatest.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us to use the Marxist-Leninist method to analyze political situations and estimate class forces. At this crucial moment when the great proletarian cultural revolution is entering the final showdown between the two classes, the two roads, the two lines, and the two headquarters, we must especially recognize the fine situation and advance in victory with unshakable determination.

We must look at the situation from its essence and main trend. The development of the revolution will not be smooth sailing, straight up. It will inevitably encounter various obstacles and problems, and the masses will also produce this or that shortcoming in the struggle. But we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the reliable People's Liberation Army, and the united efforts of the broad revolutionary masses. On our road ahead, there are no fortresses that cannot be stormed and no difficulties that cannot be overcome. In leading us in the revolutionary struggle, our great teacher Chairman Mao has always fully considered the difficulties, but has always been full of confidence in victory. We must forever take our great leader Chairman Mao as our shining example.

We must look at the situation comparatively and developmentally, that is, we must look at problems historically and comprehensively. Today's situation, compared with last year, has undergone earth-shaking changes. At this time last year, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, although they were a small handful, still had some power. But now, they are paralyzed. Their sabotage is nothing but the last struggles of the dying.

We must look at the situation as a whole. We are advancing victoriously, and on the road of victory, the situation is excellent. However, the development of the whole country is uneven, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, it is advancing in waves. We must not make erroneous estimates of the overall situation just because there are some twists and turns.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "think more." We must think more when looking at the situation, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, grasp and use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, and use the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism to think, observe, and analyze problems. Without Mao Zedong Thought, the method of looking at problems will inevitably be wrong, and the situation cannot be scientifically analyzed.

The class enemies at home and abroad, including the handful of the biggest bourgeois representatives within our Party, hate and fear our great proletarian cultural revolution to death. They are doing everything they can to slander this great revolution and defame this great mass movement. "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Their abuse proves that we have done well, very well, and can only further inspire our confidence and determination to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: to believe in and rely on the masses, to believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, to believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. All comrades in the army, together with all proletarian revolutionaries, all Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and all revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, let us unite more closely, and on a larger scale, launch a movement to support the army and love the people. We will certainly be able to push the great proletarian cultural revolution further forward and achieve even more splendid new victories!

### 形势大好，乘胜前进

　　形势大好，乘胜前进
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，一年多来，打了很大很大的胜仗，取得了辉煌的战果，呈现出一片大好的革命形势。
    这个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，来了一个彻底的大破除，毛泽东思想来了一个空前的大普及。这个运动，从东到西，从北到南，充分地发动了我国几亿人民群众，大大促进了我国几亿人民群众的思想革命化。正象伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    这场汹涌澎湃的大革命，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来了。他们在人民群众觉醒的威力面前，已经破产了，已经垮台了。他们幻想在中国这块土地上复辟资本主义的美梦被我们粉碎了，这是多么大快人心，人心大快的事啊！
    经过这样一场轰轰烈烈的群众斗争的大风暴，无产阶级的新生骨干力量，正在大量地涌现出来。经过激烈的阶级斗争的考验，发现了一大批无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的好干部。这是保证我们革命事业和社会主义建设事业的兴旺和发展的百年大计。通过这次自下而上的群众性的批评和帮助，也挽救了不少犯有错误甚至严重错误的干部。
    在参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，人民解放军经受了新的考验，得到了新的锻炼和提高。同时，也充分证明，伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导和林彪同志亲自指挥的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的这支军队，是举世无双的，是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的，是无比坚强，无比可靠的，是无产阶级专政的伟大支柱，是保卫无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行的伟大长城。
    这个革命的胜利，是中国无产阶级对资产阶级的胜利，对地主阶级及一切剥削阶级的胜利，是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的胜利。这是伟大的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们一九四九年的胜利，是取得无产阶级政权的伟大胜利。这一次无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是保卫无产阶级政权、巩固无产阶级政权的伟大胜利。这个胜利，在理论上、实践上第一次正确地解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的重大课题。
    当然，在这样一场空前规模的亿万群众的大革命中，不可能不付出一些代价，不可能不出现一些缺点错误，不可能不遭受一些损失。但是，正如林彪副主席所正确指出的，在这样一个史无前例的大革命中，我们的损失是最小最小最小，而得到的成绩是最大最大最大。
    伟大领袖毛主席历来教导我们：要用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量。在当前无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线、两个司令部最后决战的关键时刻，我们尤其要认清大好形势，坚定不移地乘胜前进。
    我们看形势，要看本质，看主流。革命的发展，不会是一帆风顺，直线上升的，总会遇到各种阻力和问题，群众在斗争中也会产生这样那样的缺点。但我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有坚强可靠的人民解放军，有广大革命群众的团结努力，在我们前进的道路上，没有攻不破的堡垒，没有克服不了的困难。我们的伟大导师毛主席在领导我们进行革命斗争的过程中，既充分想到困难的一面，又总是满怀胜利的信心的。我们要永远以伟大领袖毛主席为光辉的榜样。
    我们看形势，要作比较，要看发展，也就是要历史地、全面地看问题。今天的形势，同去年相比，有着翻天覆地的变化。去年这个时候，党内走资本主义道路当权派，虽然是一小撮，但是有一定的权。而现在，他们是瘫痪了。他们的捣乱，不过是接近于死亡的最后挣扎罢了。
    我们看形势，要看全局。我们是在胜利地前进着，在前进的道路上，在胜利的道路上，形势大好。但是，全国的发展又是不平衡的，正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的，是波浪式的前进。我们决不能因为出现一些曲折，就对全局的形势作出错误的估计。
    毛主席教导我们，要“多思”。我们看形势，要多多地思考，要坚定地站在无产阶级的立场，掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，运用辩证唯物论的观点和方法去思考，去观察问题和分析问题。离开了毛泽东思想，看问题的方法就必然不对头，对形势就不可能作出科学分析。
    国内外的阶级敌人，包括我们党内那些最大的一小撮资产阶级代理人，对我们的无产阶级文化大革命，恨得要死，怕得要命，千方百计地诋毁这场大革命，诬蔑这场伟大的群众运动。“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。他们的叫骂，证明了我们做得好，好得很，只能进一步激发我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的信心和决心。
    毛主席教导我们：要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。全军同志们，同一切无产阶级革命派、一切红卫兵革命小将和一切革命群众、革命干部，更亲密地团结起来，更大规模地展开一个拥军爱民运动，我们就一定能够把无产阶级文化大革命更加推向前进，取得更辉煌的新胜利！
                                                （九月一日）
