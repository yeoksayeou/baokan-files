The Thai Patriotic Front's overseas representative, Colonel Paron Chularat, today issued a statement strongly protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the U.S.-Thanom dictatorship in carrying out mass arrests and attempting to murder seven detained patriotic democrats. The statement warns the U.S.-Thanom clique that the Thai people will certainly respond to the enemy's atrocities with resolute struggle, and blood debts will be repaid with blood.

On September 5, the Thai Patriotic Front had appealed to all the people of Thailand and revolutionary people around the world to take decisive action, strongly protesting and opposing the fascist atrocities of the U.S.-Thanom dictatorship. Paron Chularat today issued a supplementary statement. The supplementary statement said that the Thanom puppet government, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, on August 31, brazenly carried out mass arrests in the capital Bangkok and in central, northern, and northeastern Thailand. This mass arrest of patriotic democrats is a savage fascist measure taken by the U.S.-Thanom clique after suffering repeated defeats at the hands of the people's armed forces in the northeast, south, and north, in order to terrorize the people and boost morale.

The statement severely condemned the series of fascist atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist running dogs—the Sarit-Thanom-Praphat gang—since they seized power on October 20, 1958. For example, in 1961, they murdered the former representative of the people of Sakhon Nakhon, Khong Chandawong. In 1962, they murdered Len Wongpan. In particular, on September 4 of this year, they brazenly announced that they would carry out the most severe atrocities against the detainees of August 31, intending to shoot seven innocent patriotic democrats: Tong Chanthong, Ping Muan, Weichai Wongpanchak, Chaiyawut Danayaphatsak, Basit Sisupong, Lek Chutao, and Sommai Jitdet.

The statement emphasized that Chairman Mao Zedong taught us: "In the history of mankind, every reactionary force that is about to perish always makes a last-ditch struggle against the revolutionary force." Six years ago, the U.S. ordered Sarit to murder Khong Chandawong of Sakhon Nakhon, but today, the flames of people's war are burning fiercely in Khong Chandawong's hometown, becoming a fire that the U.S.-Thanom clique cannot extinguish. The statement said that the end of the Thanom traitorous clique is accelerating. The Chinese people, following the teachings of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao Zedong, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," the Thai people have learned this spirit of the Chinese people and will engage in persistent, head-on struggle with the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The statement solemnly declared: If the U.S.-Thanom clique dares to torture, persecute, and massacre patriotic democrats, they must bear all the consequences that arise from it. Blood debts will be repaid with blood.

New China News Agency, September 11—Today, the Thai Patriotic Front's overseas representative, Paron Chularat, held a press conference in Beijing, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the U.S. imperialist running dogs, the Thanom traitorous clique, in arresting and persecuting Thai patriotic democrats.

On August 31, the Thanom traitorous clique, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, brazenly arrested 33 patriotic democrats and plotted to kill them. On September 5, the Thai Patriotic Front issued a statement, strongly condemning this atrocity of the Thanom traitorous clique. On September 9, the Thai Patriotic Front's overseas representative office also issued a statement in Beijing.

Paron Chularat said at today's press conference that the fascist atrocities of the Thanom traitorous dictatorship are their desperate struggles under the heavy blows of the Thai people's armed forces. This once again exposes the paper tiger face of the Thanom traitorous clique. Paron Chularat pointed out that the struggle of the Thai people, with the support of the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, will certainly achieve final victory.

Paron Chularat, in answering questions from reporters, strongly condemned the crimes of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique in colluding with the Thai reactionary government and using Thai traitors and social scum to betray Thai patriots and revolutionary organizations. He said that the facts have proven that Soviet modern revisionism is not only the enemy of the Thai people but also the common enemy of the people of the world. Therefore, anti-imperialism must also be anti-revisionism.

    泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表强烈谴责美泰反动派迫害爱国者
    号召泰国人民同敌人展开针锋相对斗争
    苏修勾结美泰反动派出卖泰国人民革命，是泰国人民的敌人
    据新华社九日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖中校今天发表声明，强烈抗议美国—他侬独裁集团进行大逮捕并妄图杀害七位被捕的爱国民主人士的法西斯暴行。声明警告美国—他侬集团，泰国人民一定要用针锋相对的斗争来回答敌人的暴行，血债一定要用血来还。
    泰国爱国阵线于九月五日曾向全泰国人民和全世界革命人民发出呼吁：共同采取坚决行动，强烈抗议和反对美国—他侬独裁集团的法西斯暴行，帕荣·朱拉暖今天发表了补充声明。补充声明说，他侬卖国傀儡政府在美帝国主义的指使下，于八月三十一日悍然在首都曼谷和中部、北部进行大逮捕。这次对爱国民主人士进行大逮捕，是美国—他侬集团在东北部、南部和北部受到人民武装力量的袭击，屡遭惨败之后，为了恐吓人民、鼓起士气而采取的野蛮的法西斯手段。
    声明严厉谴责了美帝国主义走狗——沙立—他侬—巴博强盗集团从一九五八年十月二十日篡夺政权以来的一系列法西斯暴行，例如，一九六一年他们杀害了前沙功那空府人民代表空·赞达翁。一九六二年，他们又杀害了伦·汪攀。特别是在今年九月四日，竟悍然宣布要对八月三十一日被捕人士施行最严重的暴行，要枪杀七位无辜的爱国民主人士，即：通·璋诗，平·磨翁，威猜·汪潘乍仑，猜耶哇·丹耶巴实提猜，巴实·司素蓬，勒·初多，颂迈·吉滴坛。
    声明强调指出，毛泽东主席教导我们说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。六年前，美帝指使沙立杀害沙功那空府的空·赞达翁，然而，今天人民战争的烈火已在空·赞达翁的故乡熊熊燃烧起来了，成为美国—他侬集团无法扑灭的火焰。声明说，他侬卖国集团的末日已加速来临。中国人民遵循世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所教导的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，泰国人民学习了中国人民的这种精神，将和美国—他侬集团作坚持不懈的针锋相对的斗争。
    声明最后庄严宣布：如果美国—他侬集团敢于对爱国民主人士进行折磨、迫害和屠杀，他们必须承担由此所产生的一切后果。血债一定要用血来还。
    新华社十一日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖今天在北京举行记者招待会，强烈谴责美帝国主义走狗泰国他侬卖国集团逮捕和迫害泰国爱国民主人士的法西斯暴行。
    八月三十一日，泰国他侬卖国集团在美帝国主义指使下，悍然逮捕了三十三名爱国民主人士，并阴谋杀害他们。泰国爱国阵线在九月五日发表声明，强烈谴责他侬卖国集团的这一暴行。九日，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表办事处，也在北京发表了声明。
    帕荣·朱拉暖在今天举行的记者招待会上说，他侬卖国独裁政府的这一法西斯暴行，是它们在泰国人民武装力量的沉重打击下所进行的垂死挣扎。这再一次暴露了他侬卖国集团的纸老虎的面目。帕荣·朱拉暖指出，泰国人民的斗争，在中国人民和世界革命人民的支援下，一定能够取得最后胜利。
    帕荣·朱拉暖在答记者问时，强烈谴责了苏联现代修正主义领导集团加紧勾结泰国反动政府，并且利用泰国叛徒和社会渣滓，出卖泰国爱国人士和革命组织的罪行。他说，事实证明，苏联现代修正主义不仅是泰国人民的敌人，也是世界人民的共同敌人。因此，反帝必反修。
