Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "Criticizing Tao Zhu's Two Books" is a heavy blow against the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

This article points out an extremely important issue to us: in the current acute and complex class struggle, we must use the penetrating Mao Zedong Thought to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and expose the enemy's new tricks.

Grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle is the most important task in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The class enemy always tries in every possible way, from the right or the extreme "left" or both simultaneously, to divert our direction and disrupt our ranks. Tao Zhu, this counter-revolutionary two-faced character, this counter-revolutionary chameleon, is an example of someone who sabotages the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the extreme right to the extreme "left".

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in unfavorable situations, in order to protect their current existence and facilitate future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves."

Currently, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the collapse of the bourgeois headquarters force the dying class enemies to frequently change their strategies. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, together with the ghosts and snakes in society, appear in various forms to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They use Tao Zhu's tricks to incite the evil winds of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything," to sow discord and fish in troubled waters. This handful of bad elements attempt to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao; they attempt to sabotage and split the People's Liberation Army, the great pillar of proletarian dictatorship; they attempt to sabotage and split the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries.

All proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses should be enlightened and educated by Comrade Yao Wenyuan's extremely important article. We must understand that the class enemies are not so clumsy. Their fighting strategies are very cunning and vicious. We must always stay alert, strengthen our enemy awareness a hundredfold, firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought as our telescope and microscope, and expose the enemy's tricks and cut off their black hands at any time. The so-called "May 16" organization and its manipulators, this counter-revolutionary clique manipulated by a handful of bad leaders, must be thoroughly exposed and smashed.

The petty-bourgeois ideology within the mass ranks is most easily exploited by the class enemies. When the enemy attacks us from the right or the extreme "left," they often find weaknesses and break through gaps here. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. Only in this way can we firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

In the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly tempered, and class consciousness has reached an unprecedented height. As long as we further grasp Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, use the method of class analysis to observe and analyze problems, and advance according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, no matter what cunning strategies the enemy adopts or what tricks they play, they will not escape being buried.

The People's Liberation Army is a great wall for defending the nation and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad cadres and soldiers of our army are determined to unite and fight with the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses across the country, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and strive to the end to defend Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Let the enemy tremble before us! The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely break through all obstacles and march towards complete victory!

### 在毛主席指引的无产阶级革命轨道上前进

    在毛主席指引的无产阶级革命轨道上前进
    姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》的文章，是投向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的一颗重磅炸弹。
    这篇文章向我们指出了一个极端重要的问题，这就是，在当前尖锐复杂的阶级大搏斗中，一定要用明察秋毫的毛泽东思想，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，识破敌人的新阴谋。
    掌握革命斗争大方向，是无产阶级文化大革命中最最重要的课题。阶级敌人总是千方百计，从右的方面或极“左”的方面或同时从两个方面，妄图转移我们的大方向，搅乱我们的阵线。陶铸这个反革命两面派，这条反革命的变色龙，就是这样干的。他是从极右的方面到极“左”的方面破坏无产阶级文化大革命的一个例子。
    毛主席教导我们：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展，资产阶级司令部的土崩瓦解，迫使那些垂死挣扎的阶级敌人经常改变自己的策略。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同社会上的牛鬼蛇神正在勾结起来，以种种面貌出现，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们用陶铸的那套鬼把戏，极力煽起“怀疑一切”“打倒一切”的妖风，挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。这一小撮坏人妄图破坏和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部；妄图破坏和分裂人民解放军这个无产阶级专政的伟大支柱；妄图破坏和分裂无产阶级革命派的大团结。
    一切无产阶级革命派，一切革命群众，都应该从姚文元同志这篇极其重要的文章中，得到启发，受到教育。要懂得阶级敌人并不是那样笨拙的。他们的斗争策略，是很狡猾、很毒辣的。我们必须时刻保持清醒的头脑，百倍地加强敌情观念，牢牢地掌握毛泽东思想这个望远镜、显微镜，随时揭穿敌人的阴谋，斩断敌人的黑手。对于所谓“五·一六”的组织者和操纵者，这样被一小撮坏头头操纵的搞阴谋的反革命小集团，必须彻底揭露，彻底粉碎。
    群众队伍内部的小资产阶级思潮，最容易被阶级敌人利用。敌人从右的方面或极“左”方面向我们进攻的时候，常常从这里寻找弱点，冲破缺口。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。这样，才能坚定地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向。
    在一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，得到了很大的锻炼，阶级觉悟空前提高。只要我们进一步掌握毛泽东思想这个强大武器，用阶级分析的方法观察和分析问题，紧紧跟着毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，敌人不管采取什么狡猾的策略，玩弄什么花招，都逃脱不了被埋葬的命运。
    人民解放军是保卫国防和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大长城。我军广大指战员誓同全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众团结战斗在一起，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，为保卫毛主席的伟大战略部署，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋斗到底！
    让敌人在我们面前发抖吧！无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，必将冲破一切阻拦，走向彻底胜利！　　（九月十一日）
