	Comrade Le Duan, in his speech at the banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai, stated that the Vietnamese people, armed with Chairman Hu's call, are resolutely and thoroughly defeating American imperialism. American imperialism, using both force and the pretext of "peaceful resolution," cannot suppress or deceive the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people is filled with boundless fraternal and comradely affection.

	Comrades and Friends,

	The task and honor of our delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to represent the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to represent the Vietnamese people in coming to the capital, Beijing, to participate in the grand celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. First of all, we convey the most enthusiastic, united, and fraternal greetings and respect from the entire Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Chairman Hu Zhiming to the Communist Party of China, the government of the People's Republic of China, our beloved Chairman Mao, and the seven hundred million brothers and sisters of China.

	Eighteen years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by our beloved Chairman Mao, the Chinese people triumphantly defeated American imperialism, eliminated the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, feudalism, and other reactionary forces, and completed the cause of national liberation on the vast land of great China.

	Today, as we celebrate this historic and glorious day of the Chinese people, we congratulate the victory of the Chinese revolution, which is a fatal blow to imperialism in an important region of Asia and has made a tremendous contribution to the favorable changes in the balance of power in the world. After the October Revolution, the victory of the Chinese revolution has provided new and powerful impetus to the national liberation movement and has had a great influence on the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	On this occasion of celebrating the National Day of the Chinese people, we congratulate our brotherly Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and our beloved Chairman Mao, on their heroic struggles and the great victories achieved in the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The hardworking and creative Chinese people, with a thorough revolutionary spirit and unwavering determination, have fully demonstrated the spirit of self-reliance, daring to think and daring to act, and the spirit of "moving mountains." They have rapidly transformed China, which was once "poor and blank," into a powerful country with the foundations of modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern national defense. In the field of science and technology, China has basically solved the problem of researching, manufacturing, and launching the most modern nuclear weapons to their destinations using the most modern tools in just two years and eight months through six consecutive successful tests. This victory has brought joy to friends and fear to enemies, and it is a tremendous encouragement to the people of the world, especially to the oppressed nations.

	At present, the Chinese people, based on their victories, are deeply and extensively carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across their vast land to prevent the restoration of capitalism and ensure that China will never change its color. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is being vigorously and powerfully carried out. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have raised their revolutionary consciousness, determined to seize the revolution and promote production, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strive for victory on all fronts of thought, culture, agriculture, industrial production, and national defense consolidation. They are building and consolidating the People's Republic of China, making it more prosperous and powerful. The Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people are loyal to the ideals of communism and the revolutionary cause, and have consistently and resolutely fought against imperialism led by American imperialism. They have consistently and strongly supported the national liberation movements of the people of all countries, and actively defended world peace.

	The great victories achieved by the Chinese people in all aspects of the construction and development of their motherland are the great victories of the socialist system and the victories of the glorious Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong, who is deeply respected by the Chinese people.

	The Vietnamese people highly evaluate the position and role of the Chinese revolution in the world revolution and the influence of the victories of the Chinese people in the socialist construction on the world revolution. They believe that the victories of the Chinese people are a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and the people of the world who are fighting for freedom, liberation, peace, democracy, and socialism.

	The Vietnamese people, who are delighted and inspired by the brilliant achievements of their brotherly Chinese people over the past eighteen years and regard this victory as their own, sincerely congratulate the great Chinese people. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, under the radiance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we sincerely wish the brotherly Chinese people more and greater victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We sincerely wish the brotherly Chinese people a thorough victory in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, building and consolidating the People's Republic of China to be more powerful.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai,
	Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun,
	Dear Comrades and Friends,

	The anti-American national salvation war of our Vietnamese people is developing victoriously and is entering a stage of fierce fighting but will surely achieve a glorious victory.

	American imperialism suffered heavy defeats in the first phase of its partial war against the Vietnamese people and in the destructive war it waged against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam using its air and naval forces. However, the stubborn and cunning American imperialism is still unwilling to give up its mad desires and is strengthening and expanding its war of aggression, continuing to escalate the war to a higher stage, which is fraught with immeasurable dangers for them. They are still using extremely barbaric means of war, committing heinous crimes against the people of both North and South Vietnam. But these mad war actions not only cannot save American imperialism and its lackeys from defeat but will make them sink deeper into a quagmire from which they cannot extricate themselves, facing a more serious and passive predicament. They not only suffer fatal blows from the military and people of both North and South Vietnam but are also firmly condemned and fought against by the broad masses of the world, including the American people, demanding that they stop their war of aggression against Vietnam. It is in this predicament, from which they cannot extricate themselves, that American imperialism recently had to stage the farce of elections in South Vietnam. But the result is that the contradictions within the puppet government and army are becoming increasingly acute, leading to their disintegration. It is in this predicament, from which they cannot extricate themselves, that they continue to repeat the old lies about "peace talks," which have been thoroughly exposed and condemned by the people of the world. Recently, American imperialism and its puppet states, together with the Quat and Ky cliques, have put forward some supposedly "new" arguments for a "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnamese problem, attempting to cover up their facts of escalating the war in the North, especially in Hanoi, Haiphong, and the Demilitarized Zone, and their facts of strengthening the war of aggression in South Vietnam. The essence of American imperialism's intrigues has not changed at all: they still stubbornly insist on staying in South Vietnam, refusing to stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, demanding compensation, "give and take," and trying to force the Vietnamese people to accept their conditions.

	Since American imperialism cannot suppress the Vietnamese people with force, with planes and bombs, nor can they deceive the Vietnamese people with cunning words.

	The military and people of South Vietnam are defeating more than a hundred thousand American, puppet, and allied troops, advancing victoriously, full of strength, and armed with the new political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which is extremely important in the life of the people of South Vietnam. No matter how many troops American imperialism and its lackeys increase, no matter how barbaric and cunning their methods, the military and people of South Vietnam will surely defeat them thoroughly.

	In North Vietnam, the destructive war of American imperialism has been defeated and will surely be thoroughly defeated by the military and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, no matter how madly they escalate the war. The military and people of North Vietnam are fighting while producing, ensuring that the socialist construction and all aspects of life in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam continue to develop, while wholeheartedly serving the liberation revolutionary struggle of their flesh-and-blood compatriots in the South.

	Under any circumstances, the 31 million Vietnamese people will resolutely uphold the pledge of independence, resolutely fight and win. United as one, the entire Vietnamese people are armed with the iron will in Chairman Hu Zhiming's call of July 17, 1966, resolutely fighting to final victory, steadfastly fighting, fighting for a long time, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, resolutely and thoroughly defeating the American aggressors, defending the North, liberating the South, and ultimately reunifying the country. "There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country more magnificently and more splendidly!"

	Since American imperialism has started the war of aggression against Vietnam, the road to peace in Vietnam lies in the United States stopping its aggression. The U.S. government must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; U.S. troops and allied troops must withdraw from South Vietnam; the National Liberation Front must be recognized as the sole genuine representative of the people of South Vietnam; the Vietnamese people must be allowed to settle their internal affairs themselves. There is no other way! The United States has no right to demand any so-called "give and take."

	The Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is a just revolutionary war, a people's war of an extremely high level of development, fighting against the most reactionary imperialist forces of our time, the unjust and counter-revolutionary war of aggression of American imperialism. Therefore, through our own efforts and with the increasing support and assistance of our brotherly Chinese people and the people of socialist countries, and with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people will surely defeat American imperialism and its lackeys, fulfill their mission to their nation, and fulfill their internationalist duties to the socialist camp, the national liberation movement, and the cause of defending world peace. The entire Vietnamese people are resolutely and actively supporting, through their decisive fighting actions against American imperialist aggression, the struggles of the peoples of Indochina, the Arab countries, Asia, Africa, and Latin America against old and new colonialism, for national liberation, and for the defense of national independence and sovereignty.

	Comrade Zhou Enlai,
	Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun,
	Dear Comrades and Friends,

	The Vietnamese people are very proud to have a great neighbor, a strong comrade-in-arms, and a close brother like the Chinese people, as our respected Chairman Hu Zhiming said: "The friendship between Vietnam and China is deep, comrades and brothers." The brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the two parties and the two peoples of Vietnam and China, born and tempered in the revolutionary struggle, are being continuously consolidated and developed. Under the leadership and education of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by our respected Chairman Hu Zhiming, the Vietnamese people are determined to do their utmost to make the friendship and unity between Vietnam and China last forever.

	In the past war against French imperialism and the current war against American imperialism, as well as in the socialist construction in North Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have continuously received the full sympathy, support, and sincere and great assistance of their brotherly Chinese people. The Chinese people, with a high sense of proletarian internationalism, regard the anti-American national salvation cause of the Vietnamese people as their own revolutionary cause and have taken it as a sacred internationalist duty to be a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people. Since the Vietnamese people started their anti-American war of resistance, the support and assistance of the Chinese people to the people of both North and South Vietnam have indeed been immense and powerful. The Chinese Party and government have clearly expressed their resolute stand on the side of the Vietnamese people against every plot of American imperialism, firmly pointing out that they will support and assist the Vietnamese people in carrying out their struggle against American imperialism to a thorough victory.

	Four years ago, in August 1963, when talking about the patriotic struggle of the people of South Vietnam, Chairman Mao had already firmly pointed out: "We Chinese people are firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam." In August 1964, immediately after American imperialism sent planes to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Chinese government issued a statement warning American imperialism in no uncertain terms: "The aggression of the United States against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an aggression against China." Vice Chairman Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai have repeatedly pointed out that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle as their lofty internationalist duty and will closely watch the developments in Vietnam, ready to take necessary actions at any time according to the requirements of the Vietnamese people and government. No matter how much American imperialism escalates its aggression and expands the scope of its war of aggression, the Chinese people are determined to support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their great anti-American national salvation struggle to the end. The Chinese people all over the country, from enterprises to communes, from schools to the army, from the grasslands of Xinjiang to the industrial areas of Northeast China, from the capital Beijing to the islands, ... everywhere, they condemn American imperialism with iron voices. They are filled with boundless fraternal and comradely affection, adhering to the spirit of "suffering together, fighting together, and winning together," using various rich forms to resolutely support the Vietnamese people.

	The Chinese Party, government, and people not only resolutely support the anti-American national salvation cause of the Vietnamese people but have also provided immense and precious assistance to the Vietnamese people in economic and military aspects and have made continuous efforts to fully meet all the necessary requirements of the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle. The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle in recent years and in the socialist construction continuing in the North are inseparable from the assistance of China and other brotherly countries. The agreement signed in August this year for China to provide aid to Vietnam without compensation once again eloquently demonstrates the enthusiastic, immense, and precious support and assistance to the Vietnamese people; it has a great inspiring effect on the people of Vietnam, helping to strengthen our country's economic and national defense forces to defeat the American aggressors. This agreement is another outstanding manifestation of the unbreakable brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the two peoples of Vietnam and China.

	Our delegation, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and people of Vietnam, sincerely expresses our gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the government, and people headed by our respected Chairman Mao for this wholehearted support and precious assistance.

	The Vietnamese people, holding high the banner of unity and struggle, resolutely support the cause of liberating China's sacred territory—Taiwan, strongly condemn American imperialism for sending planes and warships to provoke the People's Republic of China, and strongly condemn the British authorities for brutally suppressing the Chinese people in Hong Kong. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that in today's era, no major international issue can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China.

	To celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I propose that comrades, friends, and we raise our glasses together:

	To the unbreakable brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the two parties and the two peoples of Vietnam and China, may they be continuously consolidated and developed,

	To the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by our respected Chairman Mao Zedong, may they achieve more great victories in the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

	To the great leader of the seven hundred million Chinese people, the dear friend of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, may he live forever,

	To Vice Chairman Lin Biao, may he enjoy good health,

	To Premier Zhou Enlai, may he enjoy good health,

	To Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuchun, may they enjoy good health,

	To the leaders of the Chinese Party and state, may they enjoy good health,

	To all comrades of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, may they enjoy good health,

	To all members of the diplomatic corps, may they enjoy good health,

	To all comrades and friends present, may they enjoy good health.

　　黎清毅同志在周恩来总理欢迎宴会上讲话
　　越南人民以胡主席号召书武装自己坚决彻底打败美帝
　　美帝用武力用“和平解决”，压不倒骗不了越南人民。中国人民对越南人民的支援，怀着兄弟般的同志式的无限情谊敬爱的周恩来同志，敬爱的康生、李富春同志，亲爱的越南南方民族解放阵线代表团同志们，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们越南民主共和国党政代表团的任务和荣誉是代表越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府，代表越南人民来到首都北京参加伟大的中华人民共和国建国十八周年庆典。首先，我们谨向中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府、敬爱的毛主席和兄弟的七亿中国人民转达全体越南人民、越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的最热烈的、团结战斗的和兄弟般深情的祝贺和敬意。
    十八年前，中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，光荣地战胜了美帝国主义，肃清了官僚买办资产阶级、封建主义和其他反动派，在伟大的中国的广阔土地上完成了民族解放的事业。
    今天，在庆祝中国人民这个具有历史意义的光辉节日的时候，我们祝贺中国人民革命的胜利，这次革命是对帝国主义在亚洲的重要地带的一个致命打击，对世界力量对比发生有利于社会主义的变化作出了巨大贡献。在十月革命之后，中国革命的胜利对民族解放运动具有新的强大的推动力，对世界人民，尤其是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民具有巨大的影响。
    值此欢庆中国人民的国庆节之际，我们祝贺兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席领导下，经过英勇奋斗，在社会主义革命、社会主义建设事业中以及无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的巨大胜利。勤劳而富有创造性的中国人民，以彻底革命和坚定不移的精神，高度发扬了自力更生，敢想敢干的精神和“愚公移山”的精神，已经迅速地把以前“一穷二白”的中国变成了一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代国防的基础的强盛的中国。在科学技术领域中，中国仅仅在两年零八个月的很短的时间内，通过接连六次成功的试验，已经基本上解决了最现代化的核武器的研究、制造和用最现代化的工具将核武器发射到目的地的问题。这一胜利使朋友欢欣，敌人恐惧，对于世界人民特别是对于被压迫各国人民是一个极其巨大的鼓舞。
    目前，中国人民在既得胜利的基础上，为了防止资本主义复辟，保证中国永远不变颜色，正在自己的整个广阔的国土上深入而广泛地进行着无产阶级文化大革命。在无产阶级文化大革命中，热火朝天地、有力地开展了学习和运用毛泽东思想的运动。广大工农兵群众提高了革命觉悟，决心抓革命，促生产，加强无产阶级专政，为在思想、文化、农业、工业生产和巩固国防的所有各条战线上取得胜利而努力奋斗，建设和巩固中华人民共和国，使之日益繁荣和富强。中国共产党，中国政府和中国人民忠于共产主义理想和革命斗争事业，一贯为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义而坚决斗争，一贯坚决有力地支持各国人民的民族解放运动，积极保卫世界和平。
    中国人民在祖国的建设和发展事业各方面所取得的伟大胜利，是社会主义制度的伟大胜利，是以中国人民无限敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导的胜利。
    越南人民对中国革命在世界革命中所占的地位和所起的作用，中国人民在社会主义建设事业中的胜利对世界革命所产生的影响给予很高的评价，并且认为，中国人民的胜利对于被压迫民族和世界上争取自由解放、争取和平、民主和社会主义的人民的革命斗争是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    为兄弟的中国人民十八年来的光辉成就感到欢欣鼓舞并把这一胜利看作是自己本身胜利的越南人民，真诚地祝贺伟大的中国人民，在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得越来越多的更加巨大的胜利。越南人民真诚地祝愿兄弟的中国人民在当前无产阶级文化大革命中取得彻底胜利，把中华人民共和国建设和巩固得日益强盛。
    敬爱的周恩来同志，
    敬爱的康生、李富春同志，
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我们越南人民的反美救国抗战正在胜利地发展着，并且正在进入一个战斗十分激烈但肯定将获得光荣胜利的阶段。
    美帝国主义在作为反对越南人民的局部战争重要阶段的头一阶段中遭到了惨重失败，又在使用空军海军对越南民主共和国所进行的破坏性战争中遭到了惨重失败，但顽固狡猾的美帝国主义仍然不甘心放弃其疯狂的欲望，正在大力强化和扩大侵略战争，继续把战争升级到更高的、然而对他们充满了不可估量的危险后果的阶段。他们仍然在采取极端野蛮的战争手段，对越南南北两方人民不断犯下滔天罪行。但这些疯狂的战争行动不但不能把美帝国主义及其走狗从失败中挽救出来，相反地，将使他们更深地陷入不能自拔的泥沼，面临更严重的被动的绝境。他们不但遭到越南南北两方军民接二连三的致命打击，而且包括美国人民在内的世界广大人民也坚决谴责他们，并进行斗争，要求他们停止侵略越南的战争。正是在这种不能自拔的、被动的处境下，美帝国主义最近不得不在越南南方演出了选举的丑剧。但结果是伪政权伪军内部的矛盾日益激化，使他们陷于四分五裂。正是在这种不能自拔的、被动的处境下，他们又继续重弹起已被世界人民彻底揭穿和谴责的“和平谈判”的骗人陈词滥调。最近，美帝国主义和他们的仆从国家伙同阮文绍、阮高其走狗集团一起抛出了“和平解决”越南问题的貌似“新颖的”某些论调，企图以此掩饰他们在北方，特别是在河内、海防和永灵地区加强战争升级的事实，掩饰其强化侵略越南南方战争的事实。美帝国主义阴谋的实质基本上没有任何改变：他们仍然拚命赖在越南南方，不肯停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，要求换取代价，“有来有往”，企图迫使越南人民接受他们提出的条件。
    美帝国主义既然用武力、用飞机和炸弹压不倒越南人民，用狡诈的言词也休想骗得了越南人民。
    越南南方军民正在打败一百多万美军、伪军和仆从国军队，正在胜利前进，正充满着力量，又得到越南南方民族解放阵线新政治纲领这一在越南南方人民生活中极为重要的政治文件的武装；不管美帝国主义及其走狗增加多少军队，使用多么野蛮、狡猾的手段，越南南方军民一定将会把他们彻底击败。
    在越南北方，美帝国主义的破坏性战争已被击败，而且必将被越南民主共和国军民彻底击败，不管他们怎样疯狂地进行战争升级。越南北方军民边生产，边战斗，坚决保证使越南民主共和国的社会主义建设事业和各方面的生活仍然不断发展，与此同时，全心全力为骨肉南方同胞的解放革命斗争服务。
    不管在任何情况下，三千一百万越南人民坚决坚持独立誓言，坚决战斗和战胜。万众一心，全国一致，全体越南人民以一九六六年七月十七日胡志明主席号召书中的钢铁意志武装自己，坚决打到彻底胜利，坚韧不拔地打，持久地打，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，坚决彻底打败美国侵略者，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国。“没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”
    美帝国主义既已挑起侵略越南的战争，那么导致越南和平的道路就是美国必须停止侵略。美国政府必须永远地、无条件地停止轰炸和一切反对越南民主共和国的其他战争行动；美军和帮凶军必须撤出越南南方；必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民真正唯一的代表者；必须由越南人民自己解决内部的事务。除此以外，没有其他别的办法！美国无权要求任何所谓“有来有往”。
    越南人民的抗美救国战争是一场正义的革命的战争，是一场具有极其高度发展水平的人民战争，它正在抗击着我们时代的最反动的帝国主义势力的代表者，美帝国主义的非正义的反革命的侵略战争。因此通过我们自己的努力，并在兄弟的中国人民和社会主义各国人民的日益增加的援助和世界人民的同情与支援下，越南人民必将战胜美帝国主义及其走狗，必将完成它对本民族的使命，并完成它对社会主义阵营、对民族解放运动和对保卫世界和平事业的国际主义的义务。全体越南人民正以反对美帝国主义侵略的坚决战斗行动来彻底地和积极地支持印度支那人民、阿拉伯各国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对新老殖民主义、争取民族解放、保卫国家独立和主权的斗争。
    敬爱的周恩来同志，
    敬爱的康生、李富春同志，
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们，
    越南人民能有象中国人民这样的与自己唇齿相依、息息相关的伟大的邻邦、坚强的战友、亲密的兄弟而感到非常自豪，诚如我们敬爱的胡志明主席所说：“越中情谊深，同志加兄弟。”在革命斗争过程中诞生和受到锤炼的越中两党和两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结正在不断得到良好的巩固和发展。越南人民在以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导和教育下，决心做出自己的一切努力，促使越中之间的团结友谊万古长青。
    在过去抗击法帝国主义的战争和今天抗击美帝国主义的战争中，以及在越南北方的社会主义建设事业中，越南人民不断得到兄弟的中国人民全力的同情、支援和真诚的巨大援助。具有高度的无产阶级国际主义精神的中国人民把越南人民的抗美救国事业看作是自己的革命斗争事业一样，并为自己提出一项神圣的国际主义义务即愿做越南人民巩固的后方。自从越南人民进行反对美帝国主义的抗战以来，中国人民对越南南、北两方的人民的支持和援助的确是无比巨大和强而有力的。中国党和政府对于美帝国主义的每个阴谋都明确表示了坚决站在越南人民一边的立场，肯定地指出，将支持和援助越南人民把抗击美帝国主义的斗争进行到彻底胜利。
    四年以前，在一九六三年八月，当谈到越南南方人民的爱国斗争时，毛主席早已肯定地指出：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。”一九六四年八月，就在美帝国主义派遣飞机进攻越南民主共和国之后，中国政府发表声明斩钉截铁地警告美帝国主义：“美国对越南民主共和国的侵犯，就是对中国的侵犯”。林彪副主席、周恩来总理曾多次肯定地指出：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军一向把支援越南人民抗美救国斗争看作是自己的崇高的国际主义义务并将密切注视越南局势的发展，时刻准备根据越南人民和政府的要求，采取必要的行动。不管美帝国主义把侵略升到多少级，把侵略战火扩大到多大范围，中国人民都决心支持越南人民把伟大的抗美救国斗争进行到底。遍及全国各地的中国人民，从企业到公社，从学校到部队，从新疆草原到东北工业区，从首都北京到海岛，……到处都发出谴责美帝国主义的钢铁般的声音，他们怀着兄弟般的同志式的无限的情谊，本着“艰苦在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起”的精神，用各种丰富的形式，来坚决支持越南人民。
    中国党、政府和人民不仅坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国事业，而且对越南人民在经济和军事方面给予了十分巨大和宝贵的援助，并不断作出努力，充分满足越南人民在抗美救国战斗中的一切必需的要求。越南人民在最近几年的抗美救国战斗中和在北方继续进行的社会主义的建设中所取得的十分巨大的胜利，是与中国和其他兄弟国家的援助分不开的。今年八月签订的中国给与越南无偿援助的协定，再一次雄辩地显示了给与越南人民的充满热情的巨大和宝贵的支持和援助；对越南人民具有巨大的鼓舞作用，帮助我国人民加强了打败美国侵略强盗的经济力量和国防力量。这一协定是越中两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和战斗团结不断巩固和发展的又一次突出的表现。
    我们代表团谨代表越南劳动党、越南政府和人民对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、中国政府和人民给予这一全心全意的支持和巨大宝贵的援助表示真诚的感谢。
    越南人民高举团结战斗的旗帜，坚决支持解放中国神圣领土——台湾的事业，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣飞机和军舰向中华人民共和国挑衅，强烈谴责英国当局野蛮镇压香港的中国人民。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为：在今天的时代里，没有中华人民共和国的参加，任何重大的国际问题都不能得到解决。
    为了庆祝中华人民共和国建国十八周年，我建议：同志们、朋友们和我们一起举杯：
    祝越、中两党和两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊和战斗团结不断巩固和发展，
    祝伟大的中国人民在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义革命、社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中取得更多的巨大胜利，
    祝七亿中国人民的伟大领袖、越南人民十分敬爱的朋友毛泽东主席万寿无疆，
    祝林彪副主席身体健康，
    祝周恩来总理身体健康，
    祝康生同志、李富春同志身体健康，
    祝中国党和国家领导同志身体健康，
    祝越南南方民族解放阵线代表团全体同志身体健康，
    祝外交使团的各位身体健康，
    祝在座的各位同志和各位朋友身体健康。
