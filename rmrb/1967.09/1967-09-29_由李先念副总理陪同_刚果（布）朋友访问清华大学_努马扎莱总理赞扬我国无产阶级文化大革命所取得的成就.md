	Ambrosius Nzanga Nzamba, Prime Minister of the People's Republic of the Congo, and the delegation led by him, visited Tsinghua University this afternoon accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. They were warmly welcomed by thousands of revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University.

	When Prime Minister Nzanga Nzamba and other Congolese (Brazzaville) friends arrived at Tsinghua University, the welcoming crowd had already lined up on both sides of the road. People held high portraits of Chairman Mao, portraits of President Massemba-Debat of the Congo (Brazzaville), and waved the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," shouting slogans such as "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville)!"

Representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations of Tsinghua University introduced to the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends how the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, had achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to contribute to the support of the revolutionary struggles of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and the people of all countries in the world.

	During the exchange, Prime Minister Nzanga Nzamba said, "This visit allows us to see with our own eyes the achievements China has made in various aspects and the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which makes me very happy." He pointed out that all the reactionaries in the world are wrong in their statements about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The Congolese (Brazzaville) friends also visited the big-character posters and teaching facilities at Tsinghua University.

	Today, those who accompanied Prime Minister Nzanga Nzamba on the visit included Bazanga, Ambassador of the Congo (Brazzaville) to China.
