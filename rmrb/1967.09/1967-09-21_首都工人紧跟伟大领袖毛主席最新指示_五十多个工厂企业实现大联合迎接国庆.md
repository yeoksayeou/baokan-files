Reporting to Chairman Mao! Reporting to the Party Central Committee! Reporting to the Central Cultural Revolution Group!

The capital workers are closely following the latest instructions of Great Leader Chairman Mao. More than fifty factories and enterprises have achieved great unity to welcome National Day.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, the working class of the capital, in the new high tide of revolutionary great unity, is taking the lead. They have taken concrete actions to resolutely respond to the latest call of Great Leader Chairman Mao, welcoming the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. On the 19th and 20th, a large number of factories and enterprises in the capital's industrial, transportation, urban construction, and financial sectors achieved revolutionary great unity by eliminating factionalism under the shining guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Factories and enterprises that achieved revolutionary great unity include Beijing Third General Machinery Factory, Beijing Radio and Television Factory, Beijing Rubber Factory, Beijing Brewing Factory, Beijing First Cotton Textile Mill, Beijing Third Cotton Textile Mill, Beijing Knitting Factory, Beijing Dyeing Factory, Beijing City Telephone Bureau, Capital Automobile Company, Beijing Gas and Heat Supply Company, Beijing Hotel, and more than fifty other important factories and enterprises.

The financial and commercial system in Dongcheng District, after several days of preparation, has already united the proletarian revolutionary factions of grain, banking, department stores, and coal construction today.

In the past two days, at the gate of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the gate of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison Command, revolutionary masses who achieved revolutionary great unity carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red flags, beat gongs and drums, reporting to Chairman Mao! Reporting to the Party Central Committee! Reporting to the Central Cultural Revolution Group! Reporting to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee! Reporting to the People's Liberation Army supporting the left! The revolutionary masses joyfully said: In the past, the capitalist reactionary line fabricated and promoted by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with Liu Shaoqi as the head divided us. Now, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and his latest instructions have united us again.

In just a few days, the working class of the capital has solved problems that have not been solved for several months. One factory after another quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the capital. They have studied and discussed them repeatedly and put them into action. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers of the two factions in Beijing Knitting Factory said: We are workers by Chairman Mao's side. We should execute his instructions the fastest and most resolutely. They overcame the erroneous thoughts of "self-centeredness" and "only I am leftist," and achieved revolutionary great unity on the evening of the 19th. The twelve units and fifteen revolutionary mass organizations under Beijing Rubber Factory were previously split into two factions and had been fighting "internal wars" for a long time. Recently, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, with the help of the army, made self-criticisms, eliminated factionalism, and swept away selfishness with the spirit of "seizing the day." They quickly established a unified revolutionary great unity committee. After the twenty-two factories and two administrative units of Beijing Radio and Television Factory achieved great unity, some workers excitedly said: We can unite quickly. This is the path led by Great Leader Chairman Mao. We must cherish, consolidate, and develop great unity. With the power of our revolutionary great unity, we will criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with Liu Shaoqi as the head, and do a good job in fighting, criticizing, and transforming our units.

In the high tide of revolutionary great unity, many units have seen a new situation where the upper levels promote, the upper and lower levels combine, and mutually promote each other. Before the responsible persons of the two factions in Beijing Third Cotton Textile Mill decided to establish a unified revolutionary mass organization, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams belonging to the two factions took the initiative to unite, and the revolutionary masses in the sanitation department and other departments also took the initiative to unite. Under the pressure of the masses, the responsible persons of the two factions immediately reached an agreement and established a revolutionary great unity committee.

Now, more factories and enterprises in the capital are preparing to achieve revolutionary great unity. The unanimous call of the revolutionary masses is: Do not fight "internal wars," do not fight "private wars." The responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations should take the lead in executing Chairman Mao's instructions and achieve revolutionary great unity throughout the city as soon as possible.

At the gate of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary masses who achieved revolutionary great unity carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red flags, beat gongs and drums, reporting to Chairman Mao! Reporting to the Party Central Committee! Reporting to the Central Cultural Revolution Group!

　　向毛主席报喜！向党中央报喜！向中央文革报喜！
　　首都工人紧跟伟大领袖毛主席最新指示
　　五十多个工厂企业实现大联合迎接国庆
    据新华社二十日讯　首都工人阶级在革命大联合的新高潮中，一马当先。他们以坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席最新号召的实际行动，迎接伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年。十九日到二十日两天之间，首都工业、交通、城市建设、财贸各条战线的一大批工厂企业中的两大派革命群众组织，在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，铲除山头，实现了革命的大联合。
    实现革命大联合的，包括北京第三通用机械厂、北京市无线电联合厂、北京橡胶总厂、北京酿酒总厂、北京第一棉纺织厂、北京第三棉纺织厂、北京针织总厂、北京印染厂、北京市市内电话局、首都汽车公司、北京市煤气热力公司、北京饭店等五十多个重要工厂企业。
    东城区财贸系统经过几天的酝酿，今天已有粮油、银行、百货、煤建等四个口的无产阶级革命派联合起来了。
    最近两天，在中共中央所在地，在北京市革命委员会和北京卫戍区领导机关门口，实现了革命大联合的革命群众，抬着毛主席画像，高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，向毛主席报喜！向党中央报喜！向中央文革小组报喜！向北京市革命委员会报喜！向支左的人民解放军报喜！革命群众兴高采烈地说：过去以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派炮制和推行的资产阶级反动路线把我们分了家，现在毛主席的革命路线、毛主席的最新指示使我们重新联合起来了。
    首都工人阶级在短短的几天时间里，解决了好几个月没有解决的问题，一个工厂接着一个工厂迅速实现了革命的大联合。这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的这一最新指示，极大地鼓舞了首都广大革命工人。他们一遍又一遍地学习、讨论，并落实到行动上。北京针织总厂两大派组织的工人学习了毛主席的最新指示以后说：我们是毛主席身边的工人，他老人家的指示，我们应该执行得最迅速、最坚决。他们克服了“以我为核心”、“唯我独左”等错误思想，在十九日晚上实现了革命的大联合。北京橡胶总厂所属十二个单位的十五个革命群众组织，过去分裂成两大派，长期打“内战”。最近，他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，在解放军的帮助下，各自作自我批评，以“只争朝夕”的精神，铲除山头，横扫“私”字，终于迅速成立了统一的革命大联合委员会。北京市无线电联合厂的二十二个厂和两个行政单位实现大联合后，有的工人兴奋地说：我们能够迅速联合起来，这是伟大领袖毛主席给我们领的路。我们一定要爱护大联合，巩固大联合，发展大联合。用我们革命大联合的力量，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，搞好本单位的斗批改。
    在革命大联合的高潮中，不少单位出现了以下促上，上下结合，互相促进的新局面。北京第三棉纺织厂两大派革命群众组织的负责人，还没有决定建立全厂统一的革命群众组织的时候，分属两大派组织的毛泽东思想宣传队就主动统一起来了，厂里卫生科等部门的革命群众也主动联合起来了。在群众的推动下，两大派组织的负责人立即达成协议，建立了革命大联合委员会。
    现在，首都有更多的工厂企业在酝酿实现革命大联合。广大革命群众的一致呼声是：不要打“内战”，不要打“私战”，革命群众组织的负责人要带头执行毛主席的指示，使革命大联合早日在全市范围内实现。（附图片）
