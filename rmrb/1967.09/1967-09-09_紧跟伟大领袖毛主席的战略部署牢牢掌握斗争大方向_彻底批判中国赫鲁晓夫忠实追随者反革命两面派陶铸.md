In order to organize the study and discussion of this article, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee issued an urgent notice on the 7th. The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and Beijing Institute of Geology, and other colleges and universities, all expressed that they must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation with new achievements in revolutionary criticism and new situations in revolutionary great alliances.

The revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai called Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "Critique of Tao Zhu's Two Books" a revolutionary battle manifesto. They expressed that they must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously improve the level of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, making them never be able to turn over a new leaf! The revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards of some schools in Guiyang, Harbin, Jinan, and Qingdao also expressed their most resolute response to Chairman Mao's great battle call when studying Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article, concentrating firepower and targets, directing the spearhead of the struggle at the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminating all their poisonous influences.

After the meeting, a demonstration parade was held. The broad revolutionary cadres of the revolutionary cadres organization in Wuhan said that Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article is another heavy artillery shell fired at the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and at the same time, it also sounds the alarm for us revolutionary cadres.

The revolutionary cadres of the "Changsha Workers' Federation" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" in Hunan angrily exposed the heinous crimes of Tao Zhu, this Khrushchev-like careerist, who brazenly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said that we revolutionary cadres are infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For such careerists like Tao Zhu, we must not only seize their power organizationally but also thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The members of the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the revolutionary cadres of the "Red Three Commands" in Hohhot studied and discussed Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article. They said that at this decisive moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, studying Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article, we must especially remember the six "pay close attention to," raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, guide petty-bourgeois ideology onto the track of proletarian revolution, concentrate forces, concentrate targets, and thoroughly criticize and expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

Some leaders of the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters of Zhejiang Province and the broad revolutionary cadres of the "Red Three Commands" in Gansu pointed out in their discussions and debates that after studying Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article, we have further recognized the complexity of class struggle, further heightened our revolutionary vigilance, and further solidified our direction of struggle. The revolutionary cadres of the "Red Second Command" in Xinjiang said that Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article is like a heavy artillery shell, accurately and powerfully striking the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. We revolutionary cadres must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, think deeply, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences they have spread.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, at this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, two lines, and two headquarters, the publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "Critique of Tao Zhu's Two Books" has brought great encouragement and new fighting strength to the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China.

The cadres and soldiers shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and push the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide!" Many units' revolutionary cadres wrote big-character posters overnight and pasted them everywhere, distributing leaflets and slogans to propagate the great significance of this article. The revolutionary cadres of the General Staff Department said in their discussion that we must carry out revolutionary criticism with higher political enthusiasm and achieve new merits in this great battle. The revolutionary cadres of the air force leadership emphasized that the deepening of class struggle and the victory of the revolutionary cadres force the class enemy to constantly change their struggle strategies. We must pay close attention to the direction of the struggle, pay close attention to defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, pay close attention to executing the unified battle deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, pay close attention to mastering policies and strategies, pay close attention to uniting the majority, and pay close attention to not allowing Tao Zhu-like figures to disrupt our ranks from the right or "left" or both sides simultaneously.

The news reached the banks of the Huangpu River, and the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai immediately organized study and discussion. The cadres and soldiers of the "August 1st Road Good Eighth Company" and the certain unit's Seventh Company, which is responsible for guarding the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, expressed that they must further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible sharp weapon, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and thoroughly criticize and expose Tao Zhu and his backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, making them never be able to turn over a new leaf.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article was broadcast to the coastal defense, border defense front lines, air force bases, and various units carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, and the broad cadres and soldiers were all inspired and encouraged. The broad cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the Shanxi garrison excitedly said that this article speaks to our hearts. The focus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overthrow the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Directing the spearhead at whom is a matter of principle.

The military region and garrison of many units, companies, and sentries in Qinghai, as well as the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams (groups) fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," expressed in their discussions: Most resolutely execute the battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fight shoulder to shoulder with the August 18th revolutionary cadres, immediately launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. The broad cadres and soldiers of the Heilongjiang Military Region and garrison organized night study and discussion. The former company commander of the unit where Liu Yingjun was stationed, Zhang Buyuan, said that we must raise the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize and expose Tao Zhu and his backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, making them never be able to turn over a new leaf! The active cadre Bo Youzhi of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Jinan Garrison, who studies Chairman Mao's works, said that Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article has set a brilliant example for us to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and achieve new merits in thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters in the revolutionary criticism.
