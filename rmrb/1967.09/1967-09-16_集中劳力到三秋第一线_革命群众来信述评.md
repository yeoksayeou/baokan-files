The busy season of the three autumn harvests has arrived. Concentrating the available labor force on the production front is a crucial measure to ensure victory in the three autumn harvests. Recently, our newspaper has received many letters from readers, reflecting the active arrangements made by various places to prepare for the three autumn harvests. A letter from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Bridgehead Brigade, Pinggu County, Beijing, states: To welcome the busy season of the three autumn harvests, all the labor force in our brigade has been firmly stationed at their respective production posts, and no one has left their post without a valid reason. The entire brigade has also made good arrangements for studying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out various activities of the Cultural Revolution, without occupying production time. A letter from a reader on the Qinghai Plateau reports: In accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "not fighting a battle without preparation and not fighting a battle without assurance," many communes have made good preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and material for the harvest. Many communes in Guide County have put forward the slogans of concentrating labor, animal power, and tools, and have made arrangements and deployments for the three autumn harvests.

To achieve complete victory in the three autumn harvests, letters from readers also point out: It is necessary to promptly rectify the current situation where some communes have dispersed and wasted labor. A letter from a reader in Gaoling County, Shaanxi, states: Currently, cotton picking has begun, and corn is about to be harvested. However, a farmers' organization in the county has held four county-wide mass meetings in half a month, affecting the participation of many farmers in the three autumn harvests. Letters from readers in Weishi, Henan, Zaoyang, Hubei, and Donghai, Jiangsu, report: Some production teams in these places have withdrawn young and strong labor force to rehearse large-scale dramas. Some places have purchased costumes and props for performances, wasting collective funds and affecting production. A reader from Dan Yang, Jiangsu, also reported: During the busy season of the three autumn harvests, some communes have made it a trend to compete in ball games, which has a significant impact on current production.

Many letters from readers emphasize: At this time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, revolutionary peasants must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, guard against the instigation and sabotage of class enemies, and not arbitrarily enter the city or set up liaison stations to support one faction and oppose another. They must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the great criticism as a driving force, and achieve new victories in the three autumn harvests.

    集中劳力到三秋第一线
    ——革命群众来信述评
    三秋大忙季节已经到来，把可以调动的劳动力，集中到生产第一线，这是保证三秋取得胜利的一个重要措施。最近本报接到不少读者来信，反映了各地积极安排劳力，做好三秋准备工作的情况。北京平谷桥头营大队贫下中农的来信中说：为了迎接三秋大忙，我们队的劳动力都坚守在各自的生产岗位上，没有一个人无故离开生产岗位。全大队学习毛主席著作、开展文化大革命的各种活动也都作了很好的安排，不占生产时间。青海高原的读者来信反映：根据毛主席“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的教导，许多社队积极从思想上、组织上、物质上作好了收割准备。贵德县许多社队提出了劳力集中、畜力集中、机具集中的口号，对三秋工作进行了安排部署。
    为了取得三秋工作的完全胜利，读者来信中还指出：要及时纠正目前少数社队存在的分散劳力和浪费劳力的情况。陕西高陵县读者来信说：当前，棉花开始采拾，玉米将要收获，但县里有一个农民群众组织，在半个月内就连续召开了四次全县性群众大会，影响了广大农民参加三秋生产。河南尉氏、湖北枣阳、江苏东海等地读者来信反映：当地有些生产队抽调青壮劳力脱产排演大型戏剧。有的地方为了演戏购置服装道具，既浪费了集体的资金，也影响了生产。江苏丹阳读者还反映：在三秋大忙期间，有一些公社赛球成风，对当前生产有很大影响。
    许多读者来信都强调指出：在当前无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，革命的农民一定要提高革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的挑拨和破坏。不要随便进城；不要到处设置联络站，支持一派，反对一派。要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以革命的大批判为动力，在三秋生产中夺取新的胜利。
