Broad masses of agricultural workers in Albania, responding enthusiastically to the battle call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour to increase grain production and ensure self-sufficiency, have, while striving to boost grain output, voluntarily delivered their summer grain to the state with high socialist consciousness and patriotism.

By August 20, the national grain procurement plan for the first nine months of this year in Albania had been completed one month and ten days ahead of schedule.

This year, under the leadership of party organizations at various levels, the broad masses of members of agricultural cooperatives and workers of state farms have, while carrying out ideological revolutionization, focused on grain production. They have actively attended work and adopted a series of production-increasing measures, including expanding the sowing area, leveling the land, building irrigation facilities, planting densely, deep plowing, crop rotation, and using fertilizers. The 75 hectares of wheat sown by the Spiton Agricultural Cooperative in Lezhe District yielded an average of about 29 hundredweight per hectare. The average yield of wheat per hectare in the Agricultural Cooperative of Albanian-Chinese Friendship in Durres District was about 21 hundredweight. By early August, on the basis of a bumper wheat harvest, Lezhe District had delivered over 5,400 hundredweight of grain above the plan to the state. The entire Durres District had delivered 21.9 percent more wheat to the state than in the same period last year.

After actively fulfilling the state grain procurement task and voluntarily selling surplus grain, the broad masses of agricultural workers in Albania are now energetically harvesting cotton.

It is expected that this year's cotton output will reach a record high, increasing by more than 50 percent over 1960. Albania began large-scale cotton planting only after liberation, but it has developed rapidly, with output increasing year by year.

    广大农业劳动者以思想革命化带动生产
    阿尔巴尼亚粮食棉花双丰收
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者，热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党“五大”关于增加粮食生产和保证粮食自给的战斗号召，在增产粮食的同时，以高度的社会主义觉悟和爱国主义精神，踊跃向国家交售夏粮。
    到八月二十日，阿尔巴尼亚全国今年头九个月的粮食征购计划已提前一个月零十天完成。
    今年，广大农业合作社社员和国营农场工人在各级党组织的领导下，在开展思想革命化的同时，紧抓粮食生产。他们积极出勤，并采取了扩大播种面积、平整土地、兴修水利、密植、深耕、轮作和使用化肥等一系列增产措施。莱希区斯比顿农业合作社播种的七十五公顷小麦，获得了每公顷平均约二十九公担的大面积丰收。都拉斯区阿中友好农业社平均每公顷小麦产量约二十一公担。到八月初为止，在小麦丰收的基础上，莱希区已向国家超计划交售粮食五千四百多公担。都拉斯全区农业社向国家交售小麦的数量比去年同期增长了百分之二十一点九。
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者在积极完成交公粮任务和踊跃出售余粮后，目前正在大力收获棉花。
    预料今年的棉花产量将达历年最高纪录，比一九六○年增产百分之五十多。阿尔巴尼亚在解放后才开始大面积种植棉花，但发展很快，产量逐年增长。
