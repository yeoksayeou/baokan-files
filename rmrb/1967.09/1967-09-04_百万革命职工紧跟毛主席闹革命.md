On September 1, at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, a central leader delivered an extremely important speech. This is a crucial moment in the great proletarian cultural revolution, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has issued a new battle command to the revolutionary masses. We, the millions of revolutionary workers in the capital, must immediately disseminate and seriously discuss these instructions, and resolutely, unhesitatingly, and without any deviation, execute these instructions.

Currently, our country's proletarian cultural revolution is facing an unprecedentedly favorable situation. The counter-revolutionary clique led by China's Khrushchev is heading towards complete collapse, and the cultural revolutionary movements across the country are advancing towards victory. We are determined and confident that under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will complete the arduous yet glorious tasks assigned to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We vow to achieve new feats and build new achievements in the revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary criticism is the direction of our struggle and an important part of the great strategic deployment of our beloved leader Chairman Mao. It is the key to all our work at present. Only by carrying out thorough revolutionary criticism and completely exposing and overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, can we distinguish between socialism and capitalism, between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism. Only in this way can we consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that our country will never change color. Therefore, at this moment, whether we can firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism is the crucial dividing line between thorough revolution and half-hearted revolution, and it is also the crucial dividing line between following or not following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We, the working class, are the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will follow Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great strategic deployment and achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

At the same time, we are determined to, in the high tide of revolutionary criticism, further implement Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people" and "grasp revolution, promote production."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." We, the millions of workers in the capital, will forever believe in, support, and learn from the People's Liberation Army, and vow to be models in supporting the army.

We revolutionary masses of the proletariat listen most to Chairman Mao, care most about production, and love our country's property the most. We have always regarded completing and overfulfilling production tasks as our greatest responsibility. We must grasp the revolution and promote production, overfulfilling production tasks. We must vigorously advocate for "frugality in revolution," conducting revolution in our spare time, and resolutely fight against all phenomena that disrupt production, protecting the revolution and production.

Comrades and fellow fighters in the revolution! At this crucial moment when the proletarian cultural revolution is achieving decisive victories, we must never forget class struggle, never relax our revolutionary vigilance, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, and guard against domestic and foreign class enemies who try to sow discord, fish in troubled waters, disrupt the revolution, and disrupt production. We will resolutely use the powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat to suppress and show no mercy to all destructive activities of the class enemies.

Beloved Chairman Mao! Please rest assured. We, the working class of the capital, will follow and defend your great strategic deployment to the death, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over all of China and the world!

　　百万革命职工紧跟毛主席闹革命
　　北京市革命职工代表会议常设委员会
    九月一日，在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上，中央负责同志作了极为重要的讲话。这是在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，向无产阶级革命派发出的新的战斗号令。我们首都的百万革命职工，一定立即广泛传达和认真讨论这些指示，并且坚定不移地、毫不含糊地、不折不扣地执行这些指示。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正面临着空前的大好形势。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命阵线正走向全面崩溃，各地的文化大革命运动正在胜利前进。我们有决心、有信心在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，完成毛主席和党中央交给我们的艰巨而又光荣的任务，誓在革命的大批判中立新劳、建新功。
    革命的大批判就是斗争的大方向，就是我们敬爱的领袖毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，是当前我们一切工作的纲。只有搞好革命的大批判，只有彻底批臭、斗倒以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能分清什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，什么是马列主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义。这样，才能巩固和加强无产阶级专政，保证我们的国家永远不变颜色。因此，在目前能不能高高举起革命的大批判的旗帜，是彻底革命和半截革命的重要分界线，也是紧跟不紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的重要分界线。我们工人阶级是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。我们永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席、党中央的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    同时，我们决心在革命大批判的高潮中，进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”我们首都百万职工一定永远相信人民解放军，拥护人民解放军，依靠和学习人民解放军，誓作拥军的模范。
    我们无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，最关心生产，最热爱我们国家的财产。我们从来都是把完成和超额完成生产任务当成自己的最大职责。我们一定要抓好革命，促进生产，超额完成生产任务。我们要大力提倡“要节约闹革命”，业余闹革命，并且坚决同一切破坏生产的现象进行斗争，保卫革命，保卫生产。
    革命的同志们，战友们！在这无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，决不能放松革命的警惕性，要加强敌情观念，严防国内外阶级敌人挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，破坏革命，破坏生产。对阶级敌人种种破坏活动，我们坚决利用强大的无产阶级专政的工具，加以镇压，毫不留情。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！请您放心。我们首都工人阶级誓死紧跟和保卫您的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗飘扬全中国、全世界！
