**Fake "Four Clean-Ups" and True Restoration**

**An Investigation into the "Four Clean-Ups" in Taoyuan Brigade Directed by the Biggest Capitalist-Roader in the Party**

**Preface**

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in May 1963, personally formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work (Draft)" (the "Ten Points"). This is the first great Marxist-Leninist programmatic document for the socialist education movement in China's rural areas. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party openly proposed and promoted a counter-revolutionary line that was "left" in form but right in essence, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao resolutely fought against this counter-revolutionary line. The "Some Current Problems in the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the "Twenty-Three Points") is the result of the victory over this counter-revolutionary line.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party, in order to promote his counter-revolutionary line that was "left" in form but right in essence, and to restore capitalism, dispatched his wife, the bourgeois element Wang ××, to Luwangzhuang Commune, Taoyuan Brigade in Hebei Province to carry out what was called a "work point."

Wang ×× stayed in Taoyuan for the so-called "work point" from late November 1963 to late April 1964, a total of five months. During this period, Wang ×× performed on stage, while the biggest capitalist-roader in the party directed from behind the scenes, giving instructions, exchanging letters, and controlling remotely. From principles to specifics, from steps to methods, from who to attack to who to protect, everything was meticulously planned and specifically deployed.

After leaving the village, Wang ×× returned to Taoyuan twice for inspections. The "consolidation team" she left behind continued for two years and four months, until late August 1966, when Wang ×× was driven out of Tsinghua University in Beijing, she hastily withdrew.

The so-called "work point" in Taoyuan is a typical example of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party promoting a counter-revolutionary line that was "left" in form but right in essence. It is a black experimental field for restoring capitalism, a fake "four clean-ups," and a true restoration.

The so-called "Taoyuan experience" meticulously concocted by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party is a big poisonous weed against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. This black experience, after being hyped and poisoned by Wang ×× in Beijing and Tianjin, was then peddled to many provinces and cities. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party also stole the name of the central authorities to wholesale this black "experience" nationwide. This is a well-planned, purposeful, and organized plot to usurp the party and the country, and to carry out the restoration of capitalism. It must be thoroughly exposed and thoroughly criticized.

Let us see what they actually did in Taoyuan.

**1. Painting the Socialist Countryside as Pitch Black**

In May 1963, Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work (Draft)," which pointed out: "The overall situation in the countryside has greatly improved," and "now, in many places, a new high tide of agricultural production has emerged." At the same time, it pointed out: "Currently, there is a serious and sharp class struggle in Chinese society."

Before Wang ××, the bourgeois element, came to Taoyuan Brigade to carry out the fake "four clean-ups," the main class struggle in Taoyuan Brigade was manifested in:

1. The overthrown landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements were unwilling to accept defeat. They maliciously attacked socialism, attacked the people's commune, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities to sabotage collective production. For example: The rich farmer Yu ×× attacked the people's commune, saying it was not as good as individual farming, and deliberately drove a cart to damage the crops in the team's field; the counter-revolutionary Zhao ××, under the pretext of low work points, secretly incited the masses to go on strike; the rich farmer Guo ×× arbitrarily sold the house that had been confiscated during the land reform. In addition, a few landlords and rich farmers concealed their class status for a long time, and some even infiltrated the cadre ranks.

2. During the three years of natural disasters and difficulties, some well-off farmers had spontaneous capitalist tendencies, enthusiastically engaging in small-scale reclamation and small-scale freedom, and some even envied individual farming, discussing the good points of contracting production to households.

3. In 1961, under the commune system, Guan Jingdong and his cousin Guan ××, who had always been involved in embezzlement, theft, speculation, gambling, and profiteering, returned to Taoyuan. They infiltrated the party branch committee (Guan Jingdong served as a branch committee member, brigade security chief, and militia company commander, while Guan ×× served as deputy branch secretary and brigade leader), continuing their activities of embezzlement, theft, and speculation. They also stirred up trouble, undermined the party's unity, and conspired to seize the leadership of the party branch.

In the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, the Taoyuan Brigade Party Branch, with Wu Chen, Zhao Shuzhen, and others as the core, united and led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and party members and cadres to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and adhere to the socialist road. This was mainly manifested in:

1. Emphasizing the good points of the people's commune, emphasizing hard work and self-reliance, and emphasizing love for the country and the collective. During the three years of difficulties, they overcame the difficulties, successfully survived the disasters, withstood the trend of individual farming, consolidated and developed the collective economy.

2. Mobilizing the masses to hold debate meetings and struggle meetings to expose and fight against the sabotage activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. They retrieved the property that the rich farmers had used for counter-revolutionary activities and strengthened the control over them.

3. Within the party, in July 1962 and May 1963, special meetings were held to concentrate on exposing, criticizing, and fighting against Guan Jingdong's behavior of taking the capitalist road. In March 1963, through elections, Guan ×× was removed from his position as brigade leader, and his position as deputy branch secretary was also revoked within the party.

However, the party branch still had some problems: some party members and cadres had weak class struggle awareness and did not fight against the capitalist-roader Guan Jingdong; they did not discover the hidden landlords and rich farmers in time; some party members and cadres were infiltrated by bourgeois ideology and had shortcomings and errors such as small-scale embezzlement, eating more than they should, and beating and scolding people.

In terms of production, the party branch relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, united the broad masses of commune members, worked hard, and developed production actively. The collective economy was increasingly consolidated.

1. Agricultural production continued to rise: the grain yield per mu in 1963 was about 20% higher than in 1957 during the high-level cooperative, and more than doubled compared to the early days of liberation.

2. The state grain procurement task was exceeded year after year: from 1961 to 1963, a total of 76,000 jin was exceeded. At the same time, from 1959 to 1961, the state's vegetable delivery task at that time was also exceeded. It was one of the few brigades in Luannan that completed the grain procurement task.

3. Large livestock was well-raised and reproduced in large numbers. From 1959 to 1961, 31 horses, mules, and cattle were reproduced. By 1961, the collective and commune members had an average of one and a half pigs per household.

4. Public accumulation correspondingly increased. Among them, the public fund was 3,809 yuan in 1961, 6,684 yuan in 1962, and 6,342 yuan in 1963.

With the development of production, the living standards of the commune members continued to improve. Especially during the three years of economic difficulties, the living arrangements for the commune members were relatively good.

The Taoyuan Brigade Party Branch, from its establishment in 1959 to the "four clean-ups" in 1963, was always one of the advanced party branches in Luannan. It had received multiple commendations and rewards from the county, district, commune, and higher authorities, and had attended the representative meeting of advanced units in the county.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party saw the situation in China's socialist countryside as pitch black and also described the situation in Taoyuan Brigade as pitch black. In a letter to Wang ××, he insisted: "The Taoyuan Party Branch is basically not a Communist Party," and "basically it is a counter-revolutionary dual power." Wang ×× also said: "This party branch in Taoyuan... is not a matter of changing color, it is fundamentally not red." It was all nonsense.

According to Chairman Mao's teachings, the "four clean-ups" in Taoyuan should have boldly and thoroughly mobilized the masses, relied on the majority of the masses, relied on the majority of the cadres, concentrated their efforts, and severely attacked the small group of capitalist-roaders who had infiltrated the party, such as Guan Jingdong. They should have united and educated the cadres who had made mistakes, raised the socialist awareness of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and Wang ×× directed their arrows at the good and relatively good cadres and the broad masses of commune members, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

**2. Engaging in Secretive and Mysterious Activities, Furiously Opposing the Use of Class Analysis Methods for Social Investigation, and Furiously Opposing the Revolutionary Mass Movement**

Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work (Draft)," which pointed out: "This movement must have strong leadership, rely on the organization of poor and lower-middle peasants, conduct good investigation and research among the masses, and mobilize the masses thoroughly."

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party did not trust the grassroots party organizations, let alone the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members. He furiously opposed Chairman Mao's advocacy of the mass line, opposed using class analysis methods for investigation and research, and said nonsense such as "the poor and lower-middle peasants do not tell us the truth," and "in many cases, the method of holding investigation meetings is not effective.... Investigation meetings cannot uncover problems." He also said: "After the work team enters the village, some secret work must be done. Only by taking root and connecting, will they dare to speak."

The bourgeois element Wang ××, upon entering Taoyuan, acted as if she had entered an "enemy-occupied area." She used an alias, Bo Dongpu, disguised herself, wore a large mask, wrapped a large headscarf, and had security personnel secretly following her. She conducted secret investigations, acted stealthily, and engaged in secret activities. Sometimes, meetings were held inside the house, and sentries were placed outside. Anyone who wanted to see Wang ×× had to be reported by the security personnel, like entering a government office. The entire process of "taking root," "examining root," "determining root," and "using root" was decided by her alone. She turned the lively socialist education movement into a cold and mysterious affair. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "After more than ten years of liberation, they still treat our Taoyuan as if it were under the rule of the Kuomintang!"

Wang ××, through taking root and connecting, selected and cultivated her trusted followers as her tools for carrying out the fake "four clean-ups" and true restoration. The active counter-revolutionary Yuan Shaotian was the first "main root" she planted after entering the village. Yuan Shaotian, since childhood, was lazy, did not like to work, cheated, and was a hooligan. In 1958, he was criticized by the masses for destroying the team's seedlings. In 1962, he forged official seals, impersonated a military supply officer from a certain unit, and went to Harbin to sell oil and grain crops, and was detained by the local public security department. In the same year, he also colluded with the four-class elements to sell the more than 1,000 jin of grain he had stolen. In addition, he beat and scolded the masses multiple times, acted arrogantly, and the masses called him "the hated one." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was arrested and punished for writing reactionary leaflets and viciously attacking the great leader Chairman Mao. Such a scoundrel, Wang ×× particularly favored and cultivated him, using him as a henchman during the "four clean-ups," and promoting him to be the deputy security chief of the brigade and the deputy chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of the small team.

During the "four clean-ups," Wang ×× manipulated a few "roots" to act as her henchmen. Whether in large or small meetings, it was always a few pre-arranged people who spoke. It was completely a work team dictatorship, a takeover, a movement of the masses, and a package deal.

**3. Using the Contradiction Between "Four Clean-Ups" and "Four Unclean-Ups" to Cover Up the Struggle Between the Two Classes and the Two Roads**

Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work (Draft)," which emphasized that in the historical stage of socialism, there is a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

The focus of the "four clean-ups" movement is to rectify the capitalist-roaders within the party.

The nature of the "four clean-ups" movement is the contradiction between socialism and capitalism.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party openly opposed Chairman Mao's great instructions, saying nonsense such as: "The 'four clean-ups' movement is the contradiction between 'four clean-ups' and 'four unclean-ups'." Wang ×× also said in Taoyuan: "We must use 'four clean-ups' to transform 'four unclean-ups'." "Solve whatever problems there are." She also said: "We have seriously studied the struggle situation in Taoyuan Brigade. More than twenty major and minor team leaders are connected by their common 'four unclean-up' interests." She slandered the broad masses of cadres and the people in Taoyuan as: "The brigade leaders cover up, the team leaders steal, and the commune members just sew two big pockets." When mobilizing cadres to confess their problems, she also said: "Are you loyal to the 'four clean-ups' or to the 'four unclean-ups'?" In this way, she used the "four unclean-up" big stick to attack the broad masses of cadres and the people, regardless of the size or nature of the problems.

From the beginning of the movement, they implemented the policy of "money and grain as the commanders." They focused on "grain, funds, materials, jin, yuan, and meters." To pursue money and grain, they drove all the cadres upstairs, saying: "Whether there are dates or not, beat three sticks; whether there are fish or not, drain the pond and see." The masses reflected: "Those with a little rank will be criticized," and "after the coarse sieve and the fine sieve, after the big sieve and the small sieve."

Wang ××, as soon as she entered the village, said: "Poor teams have problems, rich teams must have bigger problems." She also said: "This village is so rich, let's make it a big one of eighteen thousand!" Later, she proposed the "double ten thousand" (ten thousand yuan, ten thousand jin of grain) target.

She also promised the masses: "As long as everyone works hard, each family can get sixty or seventy yuan, sixty or seventy jin of grain." Before the Spring Festival, she proposed: "Distribute the fruits, boost morale, and have a revolutionary year."

Wang ×× also engaged in absurd "estimations," subjectively estimating the amount of embezzlement for each cadre. For example, she estimated how many eggplants a mu of land could produce, how many eggplants a single eggplant plant could produce, the total yield, and the selling price. In this way, a deputy team leader managing five mu of vegetable fields was estimated to have embezzled more than ten thousand yuan in three years.

To complete the predetermined target, Wang ×× personally supervised the battle, putting pressure on the work team members and heating up the objects of struggle. For the cadres: "First attack the periphery, then attack the stronghold," "strip skin in large meetings, attack the heart in small meetings," "slowly fry the fish, use the car wheel tactic," "shake the mountain to scare the tiger, follow the vine to find the melon," force them to stand and kneel, bow their heads, "swallow the swallow," detain them, and even threatened the cadres with a pistol, engaging in coercion, forced confessions, and fabricated evidence.

In this way, the two types of contradictions were confused, the class lines were disrupted, the broad masses of cadres and the people were attacked, and the struggle between the two classes and the two roads was led onto the wrong path of simply pursuing money and grain. The true capitalist-roaders in power were covered up and passed.

**4. Attacking a Large Number, Directing the Arrows at Good and Relatively Good Cadres**

Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Current Problems in Rural Work (Draft)," which pointed out: "The vast majority of our cadres are good. Some of them have made some mistakes, but with the help of the leadership and the masses, they can be corrected. We should and can unite these comrades to do a good job together, so as to further isolate the enemy elements," and emphasized: "We must unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres."

The bourgeois element Wang ××, according to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party's black directive of "putting pressure on cadres," openly opposed Chairman Mao's cadre policy and treated the broad masses of good and relatively good cadres as objects of attack. She said nonsense such as: "The 'four unclean-ups' of cadres are universally present, big and small cadres all have problems, and they cannot be trusted." "Regardless of whether the cadres are good or bad, fight them a few times first and then say."

There were originally 47 brigade and team cadres in Taoyuan Brigade (including those who had stepped down before the "four clean-ups"), and 40 of them were criticized during the "four clean-ups," accounting for 85% of the total number of cadres.

While Wang ×× was thoroughly criticizing the cadres, she also, under the name of "the masses taking a bath," thoroughly criticized the commune members. The entire brigade had 155 people making inspections, making Taoyuan Brigade a place where everyone was in danger.

Here, we can give a few examples to fully illustrate who Wang ×× was mainly attacking when she carried out the so-called "work point" in Taoyuan:

**(1) Wu Chen**

The bourgeois element Wang ××, according to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party's black directive, took the branch secretary Wu Chen as the primary target of attack.

Wu Chen, although he had some shortcomings and errors, was generally recognized by the masses as a relatively good cadre.

During the land reform, he was one of the main responsible persons of the farmers' association and actively led the poor and lower-middle peasants to resolutely fight against the evil landlords, seizing the weapons and a large amount of hidden wealth hidden by the landlords. At the end of the land reform, he was honored to join the Communist Party of China, becoming one of the earliest party members in Taoyuan. During the cooperative movement, he was active. In 1954, he organized a mutual aid team and was elected as the team leader. At that time, some team members did not want to accept the labor-weak households into the team. Wu Chen then mobilized and said: "We cannot leave our class brothers outside." This poor peasant, after joining the team, movedly said: "Without the mutual aid team, my land would not be well cultivated." When establishing the primary cooperative, a few well-off middle peasants and middle peasants wanted to see for a year before deciding. Wu Chen repeatedly propagated the superiority of the cooperative to them and mobilized them to join. Then, he was elected as the director of the primary cooperative. When transitioning to the advanced cooperative, some commune members said: "There are too many people, and it might not be done well." Wu Chen said: "The more people, the greater the strength." Later, these households happily transitioned. Wu Chen was elected as the team leader.

When establishing the people's commune, he served as the preparatory committee member, working day and night with enthusiasm. After the commune was established, he was elected as the brigade leader of Taoyuan. In 1959, he was elected as the branch secretary of Taoyuan Brigade.

After Wu Chen took office as the branch secretary, he worked diligently and responsibly for five years, caring for the people's hardships. Especially during the three years of natural disasters and economic difficulties, he actively carried out political and ideological work among the commune members, explaining that the difficulties were temporary and were caused by natural disasters and the Soviet revisionists. At the most difficult time, he withstood the trend of individual farming and, together with the commune members, shared weal and woe, insisted on self-reliance and hard work, overcame the difficulties, and survived the disasters. Wu Chen worked hard from dawn to dusk, deeply involved in the fields, tightly grasped and well-directed the collective production, full of energy and decisive. One year, during the wheat harvest season, due to a part of the labor force supporting national basic construction, the brigade had very few young laborers, and it also encountered waterlogging. Wu Chen led the male and female commune members to brave the continuous rain, working day and night, and finally rushed to harvest 800 mu of wheat and timely completed the summer sowing task. In the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, he led the commune members to fight against the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who attacked the party and socialism, and those with spontaneous capitalist tendencies. He criticized and fought against the rich farmer Yu ×× for attacking the people's commune and damaging the crops in the field with a cart; he severely rebuked the counter-revolutionary Zhao ×× for inciting the masses to go on strike. Within the party, Wu Chen also repeatedly fought against Guan Jingdong, who had infiltrated the branch committee. Guan Jingdong tried to pull Wu Chen down, saying to Wu Chen: "Using machines to roll noodles and sell them, it makes more money." He persuaded Wu Chen to open a noodle shop with him. Wu Chen immediately angrily criticized Guan Jingdong, saying: "What are you talking about! Wanting to get rich personally? I won't do it!" making Guan Jingdong's evil plan unsuccessful. Not long after, Guan Jingdong, when buying small pigs on behalf of the commune members, again falsely used public funds for private gain, getting a big pig for himself. To pull Wu Chen down, he also got a pig for Wu Chen. Wu Chen, after knowing this, again severely criticized Guan Jingdong and firmly refused to accept the pig. After this, Wu Chen repeatedly fought against Guan Jingdong's embezzlement, theft, gambling, and profiteering behaviors and actively reflected to the higher party committee. It was precisely because of the struggle and resistance of Wu Chen, Zhao Shuzhen, and other revolutionary cadres, broad party members, and poor and lower-middle peasants against Guan Jingdong and a small group of people, that Guan Jingdong's conspiracy to usurp the leadership of Taoyuan Brigade had not succeeded before the "four clean-ups."

However, the bourgeois element Wang ××, in accordance with the biggest capitalist-roader in the party's intentions, did not hesitate to use various treacherous and vicious means to carry out political frame-ups against Wu Chen.

1. Altering his class status. Wu Chen was born into a poor peasant family, suffered hardships since childhood, pulled a big net, carried a small load, worked as a carpenter, and was a small peddler. However, Wang ×× spread rumors, saying: "Wu Chen was originally a bad element, a hooligan," and forcibly changed his peddler class status to "hooligan" class status.

2. Exaggerating his mistakes. Wu Chen had shortcomings and errors in his work, such as being simple and rough, beating and scolding the masses, but Wang ×× arbitrarily exaggerated, distorted the nature of the errors, and said that Wu Chen was carrying out "class revenge." The commune members entrusted Wu Chen to buy a few sewing machines, and Wu Chen did not take an extra penny, but Wang ×× said this was a speculative activity.

The deputy district head Su ×× was Wu Chen's party introduction person, but later he degenerated and became corrupt. Wang ×× said that Su was Wu Chen's "root" above.

The brigade cashier Zhao ××, during the late period of the "four clean-ups," was exposed by the masses as a landlord who had escaped from the Northeast and was not classified. Wu Chen and Zhao only had a working relationship, but Wang ×× said that Zhao was Wu Chen's "backer."

3. Reversing right and wrong. Before the work team entered the village, the capitalist-roader in the Hebei Provincial Party Committee ×× carried out the so-called "four clean-ups" pilot point in the nearby Pulan Brigade, and Wu Chen, during the opening of the commune party committee meeting and the brigade cadre meeting, discussed with others the problems of attacking a large number of cadres and messing up production in Pulan's "four clean-ups." Wang ×× confused right and wrong, saying that "Wu Chen spread rumors and slandered Pulan's 'four clean-ups,'" and forcibly labeled Wu Chen with the hat of "resisting the 'four clean-ups' in every possible way."

4. Fabricating evidence. Wang ×× instructed her henchman Guan Jingdong to say: "You should boldly expose Wu Chen's problems and think about his problems politically." Thus, Guan Jingdong fabricated the charge of "Wu Chen, in 1951, when he was a cadre, let a counter-revolutionary escape." The fact was that Wu Chen was not a cadre at that time, and this counter-revolutionary was not released by him. Guan Jingdong also actively spread false evidence, framing and harming Wu Chen. He also instructed others to write anonymous letters slandering that Wu Chen had five mistresses in Taoyuan.

Wang ×× also sent people to other places to fabricate some false investigation materials, falsely accusing "Wu Chen colluded with fake police and opened an opium den." The fact was that Wu Chen neither colluded with fake police nor opened an opium den, but only set up a small cigarette stall.

5. Torturing to force confessions. Wang ××'s work team also forced Wu Chen to admit that he had released counter-revolutionaries, been a special agent, and worn "foreign handcuffs" around his waist. Wang ×× specially found Wu Chen six times to force him to confess the so-called political problems. Wu Chen said: "The party's policy is to seek truth from facts, and I cannot lie about things that did not happen." Wang ×× said: "What seeking truth from facts, you are resisting the 'four clean-ups,' you are Kuomintang style, your branch is a Kuomintang branch, it is a black branch." Wu Chen sternly refuted: "For more than ten years, our branch party members have taken the lead in organizing mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and people's communes, the procurement tasks have been exceeded year after year, and various works have always been at the forefront. We have also received multiple rewards and commendations from the higher party committee and government. How can you say we are a Kuomintang branch, a black branch?" Wang ×× said: "You are not honest!" Wu Chen said: "Does admitting make one honest? Not admitting make one dishonest?" Later, Wang ××'s work team organized a siege struggle, forcing Wu Chen to bow his head, bend his waist, and even forcing him to put his head near the stove to roast. Roasting until he fainted and then dragging him outside to freeze. Using coercion and deception, Wu Chen still did not surrender. Wang ×× then criticized the work team, saying: "The firepower is not strong, too rightist, strengthen the firepower and struggle again!" In this way, they struggled for 45 days in a row. The son of a military family, Chen Grandma, returned home on leave and saw this scene, expressing dissatisfaction with Wang ××'s method, saying to the work team: "You need to understand the situation, this will cause deviations." Wang ××, after hearing this, became furious and said: "This guy has forgotten his roots, his consciousness is too low, if he cannot turn around his thoughts, I will write to his unit."

6. Placing him in a desperate situation. In the late period of the "four clean-ups," during the party member meeting to discuss the candidates for brigade cadres, Wu Chen disagreed with Wang ××'s pre-arranged henchman Guan Jingdong to be the brigade leader. Wu Chen said: "Guan Jingdong has big problems, how can he be the brigade leader?" He proposed another candidate who had prestige among the masses. This greatly enraged Wang ××. She reported Wu Chen's situation to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party, on March 27 and April 11, sent two consecutive letters, specially giving black directives on the issue of "subduing Wu Chen." In the letter, he viciously said: "Wu Chen and his gang want to restore power, to thoroughly overturn the achievements of the 'four clean-ups.'" "It is a kind of actual counter-revolutionary activity," and to "deprive him of his right to speak," and "if he incites in the future, expose and struggle against him at any time." Wang ××, according to these black directives, announced: "Wu Chen, wearing the hat of a party member, wants to play a destructive role in the branch, which can cause greater destructive effects than any counter-revolutionary." She also said: "If he is not expelled from the party, he will rise again in a few years." "If he is not defined as a bad element, it is like leaving a time bomb for us." Thus, without discussing with all party members, she announced the expulsion of Wu Chen from the party and forcibly labeled him with the hat of a bad element.

Wang ××'s attack on Wu Chen was: first remove his position, then find materials, first label him as a bad element, then fabricate evidence. On January 15, 1964, she removed all of Wu Chen's party and non-party positions, and half a month later, she formulated the so-called "plan to clarify Wu Chen's problem." On April 11, she labeled Wu Chen with the hat of a bad element. Due to her guilty conscience, after five months, she returned to Taoyuan and personally directed the work team to continue fabricating evidence.

Although Wu Chen was illiterate, during the period when he was framed as a bad element by Wang ××, he, with the help of his 12-year-old daughter, actively studied Chairman Mao's works, reformed his thoughts. He could already recite dozens of quotations from Chairman Mao and often applied them, showing his limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

**(2) Zhao Shuzhen**

While attacking and framing Wu Chen, Wang ×× also ruthlessly attacked the deputy branch secretary Zhao Shuzhen. Zhao Shuzhen was also a relatively good cadre, but Wang ×× said nonsense such as: "The branch secretary has problems, the deputy branch secretary also has problems." During the "four clean-ups," Zhao Shuzhen, due to gallstones, was bedridden. Wang ×× said: "Zhao Shuzhen intentionally resisted the work team and pretended to be sick." She also said: "This person is not honest, he must have problems." She directed the work team to ruthlessly struggle against Zhao Shuzhen, torturing him in various ways, and without any reason, gave him a two-year probation within the party, and finally expelled him from the party.

Five months after the "four clean-ups" in Taoyuan ended, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party saw in a social education briefing that there was a person named Zhao Shuzhen who was selling watches and bicycles in Guangxi. This exposure material was originally false, and the exposure material clearly stated "not verified, for reference only," but the biggest capitalist-roader in the party immediately ordered his wife Wang ×× to return to Taoyuan to re-investigate Zhao Shuzhen's problem. Wang ×× urgently recalled all members of the original work team, saying: "There is still a big embezzler in Taoyuan who has not been exposed. This big embezzler is Zhao Shuzhen." Then, she organized a special case team to force Zhao to confess the facts of speculation and profiteering, struggling for more than half a month. From Zhao Shuzhen's birth history to social relations, they repeatedly investigated, but did not find any suspicious points. Later, the work team called the unit that issued the briefing to verify, and it was discovered that it was a person from Wei County in Hebei Province who had nothing to do with Taoyuan's Zhao Shuzhen. Wang ×× then quietly withdrew the special case team and secretly returned to Beijing.

Zhao Shuzhen, after being framed and attacked by them in such a ruthless manner, worsened his condition and died unjustly in 1966. When Zhao Shuzhen was dying, he repeatedly instructed his daughter to always listen to Chairman Mao, to always believe in the party, and to study Chairman Mao's works from generation to generation. A party member who loved the party and Chairman Mao died unjustly under the threats of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and his wife Wang ××.

**(3) Yuan Xiuying**

The original brigade leader and branch committee member Yuan Xiuying (female) was targeted for attack and persecution because she exposed to Wang ××, who came to Taoyuan under an alias, the fact that Guan Jingdong falsely reported production to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party in 1958, boasting and exaggerating. She said: "Guan Jingdong is the best at boasting, he boasted ×× (referring to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party) and Wang ×× to come." This offended Wang ××, and she became the target of attack and persecution from then on. She was attacked for two months and finally removed from her position as brigade leader.

**(4) Zhao Pinsan**

The original first team leader and branch committee member Zhao Pinsan, in the late stage of the movement, Wang ×× wanted him to be the branch secretary. Zhao, because he disagreed with Wang ××'s support for her henchman Guan Jingdong to take the stage as the brigade leader, did not want to work with Guan, saying: "With Guan Jingdong, there is no me; with me, there is no Guan Jingdong. If he does it, I won't do it." Wang ×× became very angry, first pulling and then beating. She said: "Zhao Pinsan does not do it, he cannot go down easily, he must be smeared." The biggest capitalist-roader in the party also sent a letter to Wang ××, saying: "Zhao Pinsan insists on not being the branch secretary... is it already a serious anti-party activity?" Thus, Wang ×× organized a special person to collect materials on Zhao Pinsan and removed his position as team leader.

**5. Protecting a Small Group, Supporting Bad Elements to Take Power**

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. While the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, they are also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the bourgeois element Wang ×× attacked a large number of good cadres, aiming to protect a small group of capitalist-roaders within the party, support bad elements to take power, and prepare a social foundation for their restoration of capitalism.

The key figure they protected in Taoyuan was the capitalist-roader Guan Jingdong.

Guan Jingdong was born into a middle peasant family, his father was a broker, and he became a cadre as soon as he graduated from school. In 1954, he joined the party with a strong tendency towards spontaneous capitalism.

In 1955, when he served as the director of the primary cooperative, he was warned within the party for disrupting spring plowing production and privately killing draft cattle. When the primary cooperative transitioned to the advanced cooperative, he again violated the party's policy, selling production materials, and privately dividing the money from selling two mules and a rubber-wheeled cart. When he served as the director of the advanced cooperative, he again used his power to privately draw cooperative capital. His repeated disruption of the cooperative movement was opposed by the broad masses. Some people said: "Guan Jingdong is digging the foundations of socialism, he is not sincere about doing socialism."

In 1958, Guan Jingdong hooked up with the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. That autumn, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party came to the Luwangzhuang Advanced Cooperative and blew up a big wind of exaggeration. He pointed to the sorghum in the field and asked Guan Jingdong: "How many jin can the highest-yielding sorghum produce per mu?" Guan Jingdong answered: "It can produce ten thousand jin." He asked again: "Can it be even higher? Can it produce fifteen thousand jin?" Guan Jingdong said: "Strive for it." Thus, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, the ancestor of the wind of exaggeration, nodded and praised: "That would be good." At this time, his wife Wang ×× immediately took out her notebook and wrote down the names of Guan Jingdong and others. Soon, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party sent a movie projector and pigs, rabbits, and other seeds, claiming them as "capital," and the whole family joined the advanced cooperative where Guan was, obtaining the title of an "honorary member."

That year, after the people's commune was established, Guan Jingdong went to Beijing to report the establishment of the commune to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and became a guest at his home. The biggest capitalist-roader in the party spoke to Guan Jingdong about black words, fiercely attacking the people's commune. He said: "Was the people's commune built too hastily?" "Too hasty is bound to fall. Without a mass base, it will eventually collapse." "Do things without being impulsive." These black words fully exposed that the biggest capitalist-roader in the party was the chief culprit opposing the people's commune.

After Guan Jingdong returned from receiving black directives from the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, his reactionary arrogance became even more rampant, and he viciously attacked the people's commune. He said nonsense such as: "The commune is not as good as the cooperative, the cooperative is not as good as the mutual aid team." He also said: "When my family was farming individually, there was plenty of grain, and I could sell as much as I wanted, and I never had money problems." He also said: "The smaller the team, the better. Many people have different hearts, many fields do not produce grain, many people produce lazy people."

From 1959 to before the "four clean-ups," Guan Jingdong successively held the positions of deputy branch secretary of a branch of Luwangzhuang Commune (equivalent to a brigade branch), commune procurement officer, Taoyuan Brigade militia company commander, and security chief. During this period, he often used the biggest capitalist-roader in the party's name, using his power, and did many bad things:

1. Embezzlement and theft. Guan Jingdong's embezzlement and theft were not only the largest in quantity among the brigade cadres but also extremely evil in nature. When he was the deputy director of the advanced cooperative, he stole oil and flour multiple times. Once after stealing oil, in order to cover up his crime, he ordered the deputy security chief to solve the case within five days. When he was the militia company commander, he colluded with the brigade leader and deputy branch secretary Guan ×× to steal a large amount of corn. He also colluded with the counter-revolutionary Yuan Shaotian to steal cotton from a neighboring team. During his tenure as the commune procurement officer, he stole 100 jin of copper wire from the commune, and after being caught, he was suspended from his post for 18 days for reflection. During the three years of economic difficulties, he used his power to openly rob and secretly steal, sending carts to his home to pull grain and vegetables. The fine grain for pregnant women and patients in the production team was also taken by him. He even took the wheat that the children in the kindergarten picked from the fields. He also forcibly occupied two and a half rooms of the landlord's house, which had already become collective property of the production team, at an extremely low price.

2. Speculation and profiteering. In 1960, Guan Jingdong colluded with the big embezzler Zu ××, using the name of the commune, deceived the Tangshan Railway Construction Section to support the commune with wood, and sold it at a high price to divide the profits. In 1961, when the team bought small pigs for the commune members to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer, he took the opportunity to engage in speculation and profiteering. In the same year, he also took the opportunity to sell the potato seedlings of the brigade, engaging in speculation and profiteering, gaining a profit of more than 500 yuan.

3. Gambling and profiteering. Guan Jingdong started gambling and profiteering in 1953. He gambled the most times and the largest amounts. In 1961 and 1962 alone, he gambled more than 200 times, profiting hundreds of yuan. In 1957, when he served as the deputy director of the advanced cooperative, he also used his power to set up gambling dens and arrest gamblers, recovering the money he had lost. When the higher authorities warned him, he said: "I can't stop gambling, I'd rather give up my party membership and gamble."

4. Acting arrogantly and oppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants. Guan Jingdong, relying on his power, beat and scolded many people. Once, he and his cousin Guan ×× organized a few four-class elements to severely beat the poor peasant Wang Zhaorong, beating him until his body was covered with bruises, and his flesh was bloody and swollen.

5. Corrupting and pulling cadres, conspiring to seize the leadership of the branch. Guan Jingdong flattered and fawned on his superiors, gave gifts and bribes, and corrupted and pulled cadres below. In order to curry favor with an upper-level cadre, he invited him to eat and drink multiple times and sent peanuts, soybeans, and pork. After infiltrating the Taoyuan branch, he often pulled a few cadres from the brigade to eat oil and flour, eating and drinking extravagantly. As the security chief, he did not hold a single re-education meeting for the four-class elements for three years. The branch secretary Wu Chen worked hard, but he attacked Wu Chen for "having too much power." Within the branch, he played tricks, sowed discord, pulled a group of people, attacked a group of people, and used every means to try to remove Wu Chen from his position. He once said to someone: "If I don't remove Wu Chen from his position, I won't be Guan."

For such a bad guy, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and his wife Wang ×× spared no effort to protect him and support him to take power.

Not long after Wang ×× arrived in Taoyuan, in a heavily guarded small room, she took off her headscarf and mask and met with Guan Jingdong. Guan Jingdong said: "I made mistakes and let down ××× (referring to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party)." Wang ×× said: "Don't be afraid, I know your past situation, I trust you, I will protect you and give you a light sentence."

To protect Guan Jingdong and support him to take power, Wang ×× played the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick:

Set the tone. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Guan Jingdong is the pest of Taoyuan, his problems are the biggest." Wang ×× said: "The problem should not be looked at that way, the biggest problem is still Wu Chen." Some people reported to the work team about some serious problems of Guan Jingdong, but Wang ×× not only did not let them pursue and struggle, but also told the work team to keep it secret from the broad masses.

Give advice. Wang ×× told Guan Jingdong: "Can the problems you confess stand? Prepare, I will send people who have opinions about you to investigate, let them hit their own mouths." Guan Jingdong understood her meaning and quickly made an alliance with his partners to engage in speculation and profiteering.

Build a ladder. As soon as the masses began to expose Guan Jingdong's problems, Wang ×× hurriedly called Guan Jingdong to lead the way in checking in at the commune's three-level cadre meeting, helping him to pass. Wang ×× personally revised his confession draft for him.

Pull him up. When the election of cadres began, Wang ×× proposed to arrange Guan Jingdong as the brigade leader, which was strongly opposed by the broad masses of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. She then brought out the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, saying: "This issue, I have written to ××. ×× said, 'It's still Guan Jingdong as the brigade leader.'" Then, she convened three branch party committee meetings, forcing the party members to guarantee Guan Jingdong's election.

After Guan Jingdong became the brigade leader, with Wang ××'s approval, he reinstated his cousin Guan ××, who had been removed from his position for serious mistakes before the "four clean-ups," and made him the brigade security chief again. He also promoted Yuan Shaotian, who was extremely unpopular, to be the deputy brigade security chief. From then on, Guan Jingdong and a small group of people, with the support of Wang ××'s work team, monopolized the party and government power in Taoyuan, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the poor and lower-middle peasants.

**6. Building an Independent Kingdom, Implementing Bourgeois Dictatorship**

1. Under the black flag of the bourgeois headquarters, spreading revisionist poison

Wang ××, in Taoyuan, did not miss any opportunity to vigorously praise the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. Whether in large or small meetings, she opened her mouth with "××'s instructions," "×× sent me," "×× cares about everyone," "×× supports you." The commune members were very angry about Wang ××'s shameless praise, saying: "Wang ×× came to Taoyuan to carry out the 'four clean-ups,' opening her mouth and closing it, it's always ××× (referring to the biggest capitalist-roader in the party), but she never mentions our great leader Chairman Mao."

Throughout the "work point" process, Wang ×× never organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's works but spread the black goods of "Cultivation" everywhere. She often spread the biggest capitalist-roader in the party's bourgeois philosophy of life, "eat a small loss, gain a big profit." When she mobilized cadres to return money, she said: "After returning a few yuan, it's a small loss economically, but it gains the support and trust of the masses, and you can still be elected as a cadre, and in the end, you gain a big profit."

Wang ×× shamelessly boasted everywhere about her "three together" with the commune members, "eating together, living together, working together," but her so-called "three together" was all a lie. She picked and chose, selected a clean and quiet side room as a dormitory, and specially assigned the director of the public security bureau and three others to escort her. When she ate at the commune members' homes, she "touched the water surface of a dragonfly," had two bites, and returned to the dormitory to eat eggs, peanuts, and high-grade snacks. She pretended to "work" a bit, but she had to follow a photographer, here and there, and after taking the photo, she left. She also distributed these fake "three together" photos in large quantities to the commune members. In the offices of the brigade, commune, and county leadership, she also hung her photos. Wherever she pretended to "work" a bit and wherever she stayed were respectively erected with memorial tablets. She attracted nearly ten thousand domestic and foreign visitors to visit, building monuments for the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and herself, and gaining political capital.

2. Strictly sealing off from the outside, strengthening control within

Wang ×× was afraid that her plot of fake "four clean-ups" and true restoration would be exposed. After leaving Taoyuan, she specially set up a "consolidation team" to guard her "point" and monopolize the party and government power in Taoyuan. The "consolidation team" had a direct line to Beijing, accepting the remote control and instructions from the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and Wang ××.

Wang ×× specially instructed the "consolidation team" and her trusted followers, saying: "Taoyuan is the 'central' point, it is ××'s point," "I and ×× support you, we are backing you up." "The 'four clean-ups' experience in Taoyuan has been spread, I am afraid you can't withstand it." "In the future, no matter which level of cadres come, if they do not trust the 'masses' of Taoyuan, just push them back!"

Under Wang ××'s one-man rule, others could only speak well of Taoyuan's affairs and could not speak ill. Many cadres in the county and district did not dare to ask. When arranging work, they often had to add a sentence: "Taoyuan can arrange according to the village's situation."

The issue of Wu Chen has always been a thorn in Wang ××'s side. An important task of the "consolidation team" was to suppress Wu Chen and not allow him to be rehabilitated. Every time the four-class elements were reviewed, they took Wu Chen as the key and arranged for the four-class elements to closely monitor him. In the autumn of 1964, Wang ×× specially found the original leader of the "four clean-ups" work team in Taoyuan, saying: "In the future, the longer the time, the bad elements may be rehabilitated. You must pay attention to this, if you forget, Taoyuan will have problems, and my report has already gone out, there will be problems." She also said: "You must not let them be rehabilitated!"

The county and district supervision committees sent people to Taoyuan to verify Wu Chen's problem. Wang ××, after knowing this, became furious and said: "These people eat and drink but do not work, they are just helping the 'four unclean-ups' to be rehabilitated!" The cadres of the county supervision committee were forced to make multiple inspections.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party also personally took action and, regarding the "four clean-ups" re-inspection issue, told the Central Supervision Committee: "The supervision committee's approval can only agree, not allow rehabilitation, some can be aggravated, not allowed to be mitigated. Doing this, some people may be wronged, if wronged, let them be wronged for another one or two years."

3. Cultivating trusted henchmen, striving to consolidate bourgeois reactionary rule

Guan Jingdong and a small group of bad guys, after being supported by Wang ×× to take power, were strongly opposed by the commune members.

Wang ××, knowing that her henchman Guan Jingdong was very unpopular, specially instructed him, saying: "In the future, you must unite a group of people."

After the "four clean-ups," some "roots" who did not even meet the conditions for party membership quickly developed into the party. The brigade poor and lower-middle peasants' association chairman, who was supported by Wang ××, originally had no prestige among the masses, but under Wang ××'s repeated orders, he was forcibly pulled into the party.

Wang ×× and her trusted followers adopted various means to attack and persecute the revolutionary masses who dared to struggle and resist.

There was a Communist Party member who, in 1962, wrote a letter to the higher authorities to expose Guan Jingdong's problems, and during the "four clean-ups," further exposed them. After the "four clean-ups," he was labeled with the crime of attacking "good cadres," struggled for three nights, and was given a warning within the party.

There was a commune member who was dissatisfied with Guan Jingdong's use of power to oppress the masses. In February 1965, a cow died in the team, and Guan Jingdong took the opportunity to frame him, saying with ulterior motives that his family's class status had problems, it was intentional sabotage, secretly inciting people to raise his class status from middle peasant to rich peasant, suppressing many who dared to resist.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wang ××'s henchman Guan Jingdong fiercely carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary masses.

To divert the direction of the struggle, they used the landlord elements to frame and slander, pulling out a cadre who had made mistakes and had already been dealt with, and using him as a capitalist-roader to struggle against. They set up a court, tortured and beat him, struggling for 38 days. They also stripped a 70-year-old aunt of her clothes, beat and tortured her to death.

Revolutionary young people from Beijing and other places came to Taoyuan to connect, and Wang ××'s trusted followers threatened the masses, saying that when the students asked about the "four clean-ups" situation, they could only say good things and could not say bad things, whoever said wrong would be responsible. They also followed and monitored the revolutionary young people.

Wang ××'s henchman Guan Jingdong arrogantly shouted: "This is Taoyuan, not Beijing, in Taoyuan, you have to listen to me!"

**7. Blowing a Black Wind of Economism, Beautifying Taoyuan, Opposing Dazhai, and Destroying the Socialist Economy**

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the bourgeois element Wang ×× also blew a black wind of economism in Taoyuan, destroying the socialist economy. They attempted to dress Taoyuan in a false prosperity, using their so-called "Taoyuan point" to oppose the Dazhai spirit and sing a counter-song to Chairman Mao's great call of "learning agriculture from Dazhai."

Wang ×× once arrogantly said: "The whole country is learning from Dazhai, Taoyuan must surpass Dazhai politically and let the whole country learn from Taoyuan."

They used the stolen political privileges to forcibly take the state's money and things to Taoyuan, turning public property into the property of a small collective.

To beautify Wang ××'s "Taoyuan point," they successively built two electric power irrigation stations, two electric power irrigation points, and three machine wells. At the same time, they laid 42 miles of high-voltage power transmission lines and 34 miles of low-voltage power distribution lines to Taoyuan, and dug a six-mile-long irrigation main canal. To attract outsiders to visit and for Wang ××'s convenience in traveling, they specially built a nine-mile-long "Queen's Road." These projects used a total of 644,000 yuan of state construction funds. The masses said: "Wang ××'s work point is a point with money in her pocket."

The water conservancy construction of Taoyuan Brigade should have been carried out according to the principle of self-reliance and self-financing. After Wang ×× came to Taoyuan, she heard that no water conservancy investment had been arranged for Taoyuan and was very dissatisfied, criticizing the county water conservancy bureau for "not supporting the 'four clean-ups' and opposing the 'four clean-ups'." The original director of the water conservancy bureau only made a little explanation, saying behind his back that "even the leaders from the central authorities have to act according to the policy," which offended Wang ××'s "dignity," and he was politically persecuted, wearing the hat of "blowing cold wind for the 'four clean-ups,'" suspended from his post for nine months for reflection, and finally removed from his post.

Due to Wang ××'s "work point" in Taoyuan, in terms of material supply, there appeared a strange regulation: "Meet the needs, supply on time, prioritize Taoyuan."

The chemical fertilizer allocated by the state, in addition to being specially treated when distributed in the county, was also directly allocated from the province. The commune members of the neighboring team said: "Taoyuan fertilizes with a big handful, we fertilize with a pinch." "The chemical fertilizer water in Taoyuan's fields also grows good crops in our fields."

When Taoyuan needed to plow, the tractors that were supposed to be plowing the fields of the neighboring team according to the contract were also called in; when Taoyuan needed to thresh, the threshers that were being used by the neighboring team were also called in; when Taoyuan needed to exterminate pests, the sprayers that were being used by the neighboring team were also called in to "support." The reason was: "Other teams can reduce production, but Taoyuan can't, or it will be difficult to explain." "We must protect Wang ××'s point."

The reactionary economism seriously corrupted the revolutionary will of the masses and fostered the idea of relying solely on the state. From 1964 to 1966, although the state invested heavily, all kinds of water and electricity equipment were complete, but the production was very unstable. In 1966, the output dropped significantly, decreasing by one-third compared to 1965.

Before the "four clean-ups," Taoyuan Brigade exceeded the state grain procurement task year after year. However, in the three years after the "four clean-ups," it did not complete the state procurement task for two years. The fourth production team where Wang ×× carried out the "work point" was a surplus grain team before the "four clean-ups." In 1964, due to the reduction in grain production, the ration decreased, and Wang ×× forced the state grain station to return 18,000 jin of grain that had already been procured and stored.

The depreciation fee of the state-invested equipment could not be deducted annually in proportion, and the state loans increased year by year. The commune members said, "This is actually dividing the state's money as dividends."

The commune members of Taoyuan Brigade, suffering from the harm of reactionary economism, saw through the reactionary face of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the bourgeois element Wang ××. They said: "The witch Wang ×× carried out the 'four clean-ups,' the production was worse and worse. Only material incentives were given, the state's money was scattered in Taoyuan, the socialist economy was destroyed, the commune members were harmed, the collective was damaged, and the state was cheated."

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which sounded the death knell for a small group of capitalist-roaders within the party. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses and cadres of Taoyuan Brigade rose up in rebellion! They rebelled against the biggest capitalist-roader in the party! They rebelled against the bourgeois element Wang ××! They rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line!

The revolutionary rebels of Taoyuan Brigade exposed Guan Jingdong, the capitalist-roader within the party, who was supported by Wang ×× to take power.

Not long ago, with the support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist and agricultural support troops, a mass rally was held in Taoyuan. The revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary cadres and masses who were persecuted angrily denounced the crimes committed by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and Wang ×× in Taoyuan.

The revolutionary masses completely rehabilitated comrades Wu Chen and Zhao Shuzhen.

The revolutionary masses of Taoyuan Brigade are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seize the revolution and promote production, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, thoroughly eliminate the poison of Wang ××'s "Taoyuan experience," thoroughly smash their plot to restore capitalism, and are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, building Taoyuan Brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

　　假四清　真复辟
　　——关于党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派导演的桃园大队“四清”情况的调查
　　前言
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在一九六三年五月亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》（即十条），是我国农村社会主义教育运动第一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文件。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派公然提出和推行了一条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。毛主席同这条反动路线进行了坚决的斗争，《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条），就是同这条反动路线斗争胜利的结果。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了推行他的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，复辟资本主义，曾经指派他的老婆、资产阶级分子王××，到河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队搞所谓“蹲点”。
    王××在桃园搞所谓“蹲点”，从一九六三年十一月底到一九六四年四月底，先后五个月。在这期间，王××前台表演，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派幕后指挥，通过面授机宜、书信往来、电话遥控，从原则到具体，从步骤到方法，从整谁到保谁，都作了精心策划、具体部署。
    出村后，王××还两次重返桃园复查。她留下的“巩固组”，又搞了两年零四个月，直到一九六六年八月底，王××在北京被赶出清华大学后，才仓惶撤走。
    所谓桃园“蹲点”，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派推行形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线的典型，是复辟资本主义的黑试验场，是假四清，真复辟。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派煞费苦心炮制的所谓“桃园经验”，是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大毒草。这个黑经验，由王××在北京、天津吹嘘放毒之后，接着，他们又到许多省市兜售。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派还盗用中央名义，把这个黑“经验”批发全国。这是一个有计划、有目的、有组织地篡党篡国、实行资本主义复辟的大阴谋。必须彻底揭穿，彻底批判。
    让我们看看他们在桃园究竟干了些什么。
    一、把社会主义农村形势说得漆黑一团
    一九六三年五月，毛主席亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中指出：“整个农村的形势已经大大好转”，“现在，有很多地方，已经出现了农业生产的新高潮。”同时指出：“当前中国社会中出现了严重的尖锐的阶级斗争情况。”
    资产阶级分子王××到桃园大队搞假四清以前，桃园大队的阶级斗争主要表现在：
    一、被推翻的地富反坏分子不甘心失败，恶毒地攻击社会主义、攻击人民公社，进行反攻倒算，破坏集体生产。例如：富农分子岳××攻击人民公社不如单干好，故意赶大车压坏队里庄稼；反革命分子赵××借口工分少，暗中煽动群众罢工；富农分子郭××擅自拆卖了土改时已被没收的房屋。此外，有几个地主、富农分子长期隐瞒成份，有的还混进了干部队伍。
    二、一些富裕农民在三年自然灾害困难时期，自发资本主义倾向抬头，热心于小开荒小自由，有的还羡慕单干，议论包产到户好。
    三、一九六一年公社体制下放，一贯贪污盗窃、投机倒把、聚赌抽头的关景东和他的堂兄关××，回到桃园，钻进党支部委员会（关景东任支部委员、大队治保主任兼民兵连长，关××任副支部书记兼大队长），继续进行贪污盗窃等活动，并且挑拨离间，破坏党的团结，阴谋夺取党支部的领导权。
    在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中，以支部书记吴臣、副支部书记赵树椿等为核心的桃园大队党支部，团结和带领广大贫下中农和党员、干部，贯彻执行了毛主席的革命路线，保卫了无产阶级专政，坚持了社会主义道路。主要表现在：
    一、大讲人民公社好，大讲艰苦奋斗、自力更生，大讲热爱国家、热爱集体。在三年困难时期，克服困难，胜利度过了灾荒，顶住了单干风，巩固和发展了集体经济。
    二、发动群众，通过辩论会和斗争会，对地富反坏的破坏活动，进行了揭露和斗争。追回了富农分子反攻倒算的财产，加强了对他们的管制。
    三、在党内，一九六二年七月、一九六三年五月，专门召开会议，集中地对关景东走资本主义道路的行为，进行了揭发、批判和斗争。一九六三年三月，通过选举罢免了关××的大队长职务，并在党内撤销了他的副支部书记职务。
    但是，党支部还存在着一些问题：有些党员干部阶级斗争观念不够强，对走资本主义道路当权派关景东斗争不力；对隐蔽较深的漏划地主富农分子，未能及早发现；有些党员干部受资产阶级思想侵蚀，存在着小量贪污、多吃多占、打人骂人等缺点和错误。
    在生产方面，党支部依靠贫下中农，团结广大社员群众，奋发图强，自力更生，积极发展生产，集体经济日益巩固。
    一、农业生产不断上升：粮食亩产量，一九六三年比一九五七年高级社时提高百分之二十左右，比解放初期提高一倍以上。
    二、连年超额完成国家粮食征购任务：一九六一年到一九六三年共超额七万六千多斤。同时，从一九五九年到一九六一年，还超额完成国家当时规定的蔬菜交售任务，是抚宁地区完成粮食征购任务比较突出的几个大队之一。
    三、大牲畜饲养好、繁殖多。一九五九年到一九六一年，繁殖三十一头马、骡、牛。到一九六一年，集体和社员养猪达到每户平均一头半。
    四、公共积累相应增加。其中公积金一九六一年三千八百零九元，一九六二年六千六百八十四元，一九六三年六千三百四十二元。
    随着生产的发展，社员生活不断改善。特别是三年经济困难时期，社员生活安排得比较好。
    桃园大队党支部从一九五九年成立到一九六三年“四清”前，一直是抚宁地区先进的支部之一，曾获得地（市）、县、区、公社的多次表扬和奖励，出席过地（市）先进单位的代表会议。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把我国社会主义农村形势看得漆黑一团，也把桃园大队形势说得漆黑一团。他在给王××的信中硬说：“桃园党支部基本上不是共产党”，“基本上是反革命两面政权”。王××也说：“桃园这个支部……不是变颜色的问题，根本它就不是红色的。”完全是一派胡说八道。
    按照毛主席的教导，桃园四清应当大胆放手发动群众，依靠群众大多数，依靠干部大多数，集中力量，狠狠打击混入党内的走资本主义道路当权派关景东等一小撮人，团结和教育犯有错误的干部，提高广大干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和王××，却把矛头指向好的和比较好的干部，指向广大社员群众，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。
    二、大搞神秘化扎根串连，疯狂反对用阶级分析方法作社会调查，疯狂反对革命的群众运动
    毛主席亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中指出：“这次运动要有坚强的领导，要依靠贫下中农组织，要在群众中做好调查研究，要放手发动群众。”
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，既不相信基层的党组织，更不相信广大的贫下中农和社员群众，他疯狂反对毛主席倡导的群众路线，反对用阶级分析方法进行调查研究，胡说什么“贫下中农不向我们说真话”，“用开调查会的办法在很多情况下是不行了。……调查会调查不出问题来。”还说：“工作队进村以后，要进行一些秘密工作，只有扎根串连，他们不怕了，才能讲话。”
    资产阶级分子王××，一进桃园，就象到了“敌占区”一样，化名董朴，乔装打扮，捂个大口罩，包个大头巾，保卫人员暗中随从，私查暗访，鬼鬼祟祟，进行扎根串连，大搞秘密活动。有时屋里开会，屋外还放“暗哨”。谁要去见王××，还得由警卫人员通报，象进衙门一样。整个的“选根”、“审根”、“定根”、“用根”，都由她一人独断。把轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动搞得冷冷清清、神乎其神。贫下中农愤怒地说：“解放十多年了，还把我们桃园看成和国民党统治区一样！”
    王××通过扎根串连，物色和培植了亲信，作为她进行假四清、真复辟的御用工具。现行反革命分子岳绍田，就是她入村后最先扎下的一个“主根”。岳绍田从小游手好闲，不爱劳动，招摇撞骗，流氓成性，思想反动。一九五八年因毁坏队里禾苗，在村里受到群众批判。一九六二年，私刻公章，冒充解放军某部军需科长，到哈尔滨倒卖油粮作物，被当地公安部门拘留。同年，还把偷盗的上千斤粮食，和四类分子勾结倒卖。此外，多次打骂群众，横行霸道，群众称他“万人恨”。无产阶级文化大革命中，因写反动传单，恶毒攻击伟大领袖毛主席，被逮捕法办。这样一个坏蛋，王××竟分外喜爱，倍加栽培，“四清”中用他当打手，又一手提拔他当大队治保副主任、小队贫协副主任。
    王××在“四清”中，操纵几个“根子”替她当打手。无论大会小会，都是预先布置好的少数人发言。完全是工作组专政，包办代替，运动群众，包打天下。
    三、用“四清”和“四不清”的矛盾，掩盖两个阶级、两条道路的斗争
    毛主席亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中强调指出，在社会主义这个历史阶段中，存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。
    四清运动的重点，是整党内走资本主义道路当权派。
    四清运动的性质，是社会主义和资本主义的矛盾。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派公然同毛主席的伟大指示相对抗，胡说什么：“四清运动是‘四清’和‘四不清’的矛盾。”王××到桃园也说：“我们必须用‘四清’去改造‘四不清’。”“有什么问题解决什么问题。”她还说：“我们认真研究了桃园大队的斗争形势，二十几个主要的大小队干部，他们由共同的四不清利益连结在一起。”她污蔑桃园广大干部和群众是：“大队干部搂，小队干部偷，社员就缝了两个大裤兜。”在动员干部交代问题时也说：“你是忠于四清，还是忠于四不清？”这样，就把广大干部和群众，不论问题大小、性质如何，都用“四不清”大棒加以打击。
    运动一开始，他们就实行钱粮挂帅。大抓“粮、款、物、斤、元、尺”。为了追钱追粮，把干部通通赶上楼，说什么“有枣没枣打三竿，有鱼没鱼淘干了看。”群众反映：“挂点‘衔’的都得挨整”，“过了粗罗过细罗，过了大筛过小筛”。
      王××一进村就说：“穷队有问题，富队问题一定更大。”又说：“这个村这么富，还不搞它个一万八千的！”后来，又提出了“双两万”（两万块钱、两万斤粮）的指标。
      她还向群众许愿：“只要大家好好干，每家能分到六七十块钱，六七十斤粮。”春节前又提出：“分果实，鼓斗志，过个革命年。”
      王××还搞荒谬的“估产”，主观估计每个干部的贪污数字。例如，估计一亩地种多少棵茄秧，一棵茄秧结多少茄子，总共能产多少斤，卖多少钱。这样，一个管理五亩菜地的生产队副队长，三年就被估计贪污上万元。
    为了完成既定指标，王××亲自督战，给工作队员“加压”，给被斗对象“加温”。对干部：“先打外围，后打攻坚”，“大会剥皮，小会攻心”，“慢火煎鱼，车轮战术”，“敲山震虎，顺藤摸瓜”，罚站罚跪，低头弯腰，“燕飞”，拘留，甚至还用手枪对干部进行威胁，大搞逼、供、信。
    这样做的结果，混淆了两类矛盾，搅乱了阶级阵线，打击了广大干部和群众，把两个阶级、两条道路的斗争引上了单纯追钱追粮的邪路，把真正走资本主义道路的当权派包庇过了关。
    四、打击一大片，把矛头指向好的和比较好的干部
    毛主席亲自制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中指出：“我们绝大多数的干部是好的。其中有些人犯了一些毛病，经过领导和群众的帮助，是可以改好的。应当而且可以团结这些同志共同做好工作，以利进一步地孤立敌对分子”，并强调指出：“要团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部”。
    资产阶级分子王××根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“对干部得有压力”的黑指示，公然对抗毛主席的干部政策，把广大好的和比较好的干部都当作打击对象。她胡说：“干部的四不清是普遍存在的，大大小小的干部都有问题，不可相信。”“不论干部好坏先斗他几次再说。”
    桃园大队原有大小队干部四十七人（包括“四清”前下台的在内），在“四清”中挨批斗的共四十人，占干部总数的百分之八十五。
    王××在大整干部的同时，又借“群众洗澡”之名，大整社员。全大队有一百五十五人作了检查，搞得桃园大队人人自危。
    这里，我们举几个例子，就可以充分说明王××在桃园搞所谓“蹲点”时，她的主要矛头是指向谁的：
    （一）吴臣
    资产阶级分子王××按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的黑指示，把支部书记吴臣当作头号打击目标。
    吴臣虽有缺点和错误，但群众公认，他是一个比较好的干部。
    土改时，他是农会主要负责人之一，积极领导贫下中农坚决斗争恶霸地主，清出了地主窝藏的武器和大量浮财。土改末期，他光荣地加入中国共产党，是桃园最早入党的党员之一。合作化运动中，他表现积极。一九五四年他组织了互助组，被选为组长。当时有的组员不愿吸收劳力弱的困难户入组。吴臣便动员说：“不能把阶级兄弟甩在外边。”这户贫农入组后感动地说：“没有互助组，我的地怎么也种不好。”办初级社时，有几户富裕中农和中农要看一年再说，吴臣反复向他们宣传合作社的优越性，动员他们入社。接着，他被选为初级社主任。转高级社时，有的社员说：“人多了怕干不好。”吴臣说：“人多力量大。”以后，这些户都愉快地转了社。吴臣被选为生产队长。
    在建立人民公社时，他担任筹备委员，满腔热情夜以继日地工作。公社建立后，被选为桃园大队队长。一九五九年，被选为桃园大队党支部书记。
    在他担任支部书记以后的五年中，工作认真负责，关心群众疾苦。特别是在三年自然灾害、经济困难时期，他积极向社员进行政治思想工作，说明困难是暂时的，是自然灾害和苏修造成的。在最困难时，他顶住了单干风，和社员一道同甘共苦，坚持自力更生，艰苦奋斗，战胜困难，度过灾荒。吴臣起早贪黑，深入田间，对集体生产抓得紧，指挥得好，干劲十足，雷厉风行。有一年，麦收季节，因一部分劳力支援国家基本建设，队里壮年劳力很少，又遇涝灾，吴臣带领男女社员，冒着连日阴雨，昼夜奋战，终于抢收了八百亩地的小麦，并及时完成了夏种任务。在两个阶级、两条道路斗争中，他领导社员向攻击党和社会主义的地富反坏分子和自发资本主义倾向进行了斗争。他对富农分子岳××攻击人民公社、赶大车压坏地里庄稼的破坏行为，立即组织社员进行了批判和斗争；对煽动群众罢工的反革命分子赵××进行了严厉的斥责。在党内，吴臣对钻进支委会的关景东等也进行了反复的斗争。关景东想拉吴臣下水，对吴臣说：用机器轧挂面卖，赚钱多。他劝吴臣和他一起开挂面房。吴臣立即愤怒地批评关景东说：“你这是什么话！想个人发财？我不干！”使关景东的坏主意没有得逞。过不久，关景东在代社员买小猪的时候，又假公济私，为
  自己搞了头大猪，为了拉吴臣下水，也给吴臣搞了一头。吴臣知道后，又对关景东进行了严厉的批评，坚决拒绝收下这头猪。在这以后，吴臣多次对关景东贪污盗窃、聚赌抽头等行为作了斗争，并积极向上级党委反映。正是由于吴臣、赵树椿等革命干部、广大党员和贫下中农对关景东等一小撮的斗争和抵制，关景东等妄图篡夺桃园大队领导权的阴谋在“四清”前才没有得逞。
    但是，资产阶级分子王××秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，不惜采取种种阴险毒辣的手段，对吴臣进行残酷的政治陷害。
      一、篡改成份。吴臣出身贫农，从小受苦，拉过大网，扛过小活，当过木工，做过小贩。而王××却造谣说：“吴臣原来就是一个坏分子，是一个流氓”，硬把他小贩成份篡改为“流氓”成份。
    二、无限上纲。吴臣在工作中存在着简单粗暴、打骂群众的缺点和错误，王××却任意上纲，歪曲错误性质，硬说吴臣是在进行“阶级报复”。社员托吴臣代买了几台缝纫机，吴臣没有多要一分钱，王××硬说这是投机倒把的活动。
    副区长苏××是吴臣入党的介绍人，后来蜕化变质，王××就说苏是吴臣上面的根子。
    大队现金保管赵××，“四清”后期群众揭发出来他是一个从东北逃回的漏划地主。吴臣和赵仅是工作关系，而王××却硬说，赵是吴臣的后台。
    三、颠倒黑白。在工作组进村前，河北省委内走资本主义道路当权派××在附近普兰大队搞所谓四清试点，吴臣在开公社党委会和大队干部会时和别人议论过普兰“四清”中打击一大片干部，把生产搞糟了的一些问题。王××混淆是非，说“吴臣到处散布流言蜚语，污蔑普兰的‘四清’”，硬给吴臣扣上“千方百计抵抗四清运动”的帽子。
    四、捏造罪证。王××授意她的爪牙关景东说：“你应当大胆揭发吴臣的问题，要从政治上想他的问题。”于是，关景东就捏造“吴臣在一九五一年当干部时放走了一个反革命分子”的罪状。事实是吴臣当时并没有当干部，这个反革命分子不是他放走的。关景东还四处活动，唆使别人写假证明，诬告陷害吴臣。他还指使人写匿名信造谣吴臣在桃园有五个姘头。
    王××还派人跑到外地制造了一些假调查材料，诬赖“吴臣勾结过伪警察，开过大烟馆”。事实是吴臣既没有勾结过伪警察，也没有开过大烟馆，仅仅摆过小纸烟摊。
    五、体罚逼供。王××工作组还硬逼吴臣承认放走过反革命，当过特务，腰里挂过“洋手铐”。王××六次专找吴臣，逼他交代所谓政治问题。吴臣说：“党的政策是实事求是，没有的事我不能瞎说。”王××说：“什么实事求是，你就是抵抗‘四清’，你就是国民党作风，你们的支部就是国民党支部，是黑支部。”吴臣义正词严地反驳说：“十多年来，我们支部党员搞互助组、合作社、人民公社都带头，征购任务年年超额完成，各项工作一直走在前头，还得到上级党委和政府多次奖励，怎能说我们是国民党支部、黑支部呢？”王××说：“你很不老实！”吴臣说：“难道承认就老实？不承认就不老实？”以后，王××工作组又组织了围斗，逼吴臣低头、弯腰，甚至还要他把头低到火炉上去烤，烤昏了再拉到屋外去冻。连压带诈，吴臣仍不屈服。王××就批评工作组说：“火力不猛，太右，加强火力再斗！”这样连续围斗了四十五天。军属陈大娘的儿子回家探亲，看了这般情景，对王××的这种做法，表示不满，他对工作组说：“你们要了解情况，这样要出偏差的。”王××听了大怒说：“这小子忘本了，觉悟太低，假如他思想扭不过来，就给他所在单位去信。”
    六、置于死地。“四清”后期，在党员大会讨论大队干部候选人时，吴臣不同意王××内定她的爪牙关景东当大队长，吴臣说：“关景东问题不小，怎么能当大队长？”他提出另外一个在群众中有威信的候选人。这就大大激怒了王××。她向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派汇报了吴臣的情况。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，于三月二十七日和四月十一日连续两次去信，就“制服吴臣”问题，专门作了黑指示。他在信中恶狠狠地说：“吴臣一伙要复辟，以便彻底推翻四清成果。”“是一种实际上的反革命活动”，要“剥夺发言权”，“以后煽动，随时加以揭露和斗争”。王××按照这些黑指示，就宣布说：“吴臣戴着党员的帽子，在支部里要起破坏作用，就可能比任何反革命分子所起的破坏作用都要大。”又说：“要不开除他的党籍，过几年他又上去了。”“要不定成坏分子，就是给我们留下了一个定时炸弹。”于是，未经全体党员讨论，就宣布开除吴臣党籍，硬给吴臣戴上坏分子的帽子。
      王××整吴臣是：先撤职，后找材料，先戴坏分子帽子，后捏造罪证。一九六四年一月十五日撤了吴臣的党内外一切职务，半个月后才制定出所谓“搞清吴臣问题工作计划”。四月十一日给吴臣戴上坏分子帽子，由于做贼心虚，过了五个月，她又再进桃园，亲自指挥工作组继续捏造罪证。
      吴臣虽然不识字，在被王××打成坏分子期间，还在他十二岁小女儿的帮助下，积极学习毛主席著作，改造思想。他已能背诵几十条毛主席语录并经常应用，表现了他对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
      （二）赵树椿
      王××在打击陷害吴臣的同时，还残酷打击了副支部书记赵树椿。赵树椿也是比较好的干部，王××却胡说：“支部书记有问题，副支书问题也少不了。”赵树椿在“四清”中，因胆结石病，卧床不起，王××就说：“赵树椿有意对抗工作组，装病。”并捕风捉影地说：“这个人不老实，肯定有问题。”她指挥工作组对赵树椿进行残酷围斗，百般折磨，并毫无理由地给他留党察看两年处分，最后干脆开除了他的党籍。
      桃园“四清”结束五个月后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派从一份社教简报中，看到有个叫赵树椿的，在广西倒卖手表、自行车的事。这个揭发材料本来就是假的，揭发材料上也明明写着“未经查对，仅供参考”的字样，而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却立即要他的老婆王××赶回桃园重新追查赵树椿的问题。王××星夜召回了原工作组的全体人员，说：“桃园还有一个大贪污犯没有搞出来。这个大贪污犯就是赵树椿。”接着就组织了专案组，逼赵交代投机倒把事实，整整搞了半个多月。从赵树椿的出身历史到社会关系反复追查，都没有发现任何疑点。后来，工作组打电话到出简报的单位查对，这才发现，是把河北省威县的一个毫不相干的人，毫不相干的事，硬拉到桃园的赵树椿头上。王××才悄悄地撤了专案组，偷偷溜回北京。
    赵树椿经过他们这样残酷的陷害和打击，病情恶化，终于在一九六六年含冤死去。赵树椿临死的时候还再三嘱咐他的女儿，要永远听毛主席的话，要永远相信党，世世代代学习毛主席著作。一个热爱党、热爱毛主席的党员，就这样屈死在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他老婆王××的威逼之下。
    （三）袁秀英
    原大队长、党支部委员袁秀英（女），由于在化名来桃园的王××面前，揭露了关景东在一九五八年向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派假报产量，浮夸吹牛的事实，说：“关景东最能吹牛，把××（指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派）和王××都吹来了。”这就触犯了王××，从此，便成了被打击迫害的对象，整了她两个月，最后搞掉了她的大队长职务。
    （四）赵品三
    原一队队长、党支部委员赵品三，在运动后期，王××要让他当支部书记。赵因不同意王××扶植她的爪牙关景东上台当大队长，不愿和关搭班子，说：“有关景东就没有我，有我就没有关景东，他干我就不干。”王××就大为恼火，先拉后打。说：“赵品三不干，不能让他白白下去，非把他搞臭不可。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派也给王××来信说：“赵品三坚决不当支书……是否已经是一种严重的反党活动。”于是，王××就组织专人搜集整赵品三的材料，并撤了他生产队长的职务。
    五、保护一小撮，扶植坏人当政
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级分子王××打击一大片好干部，目的就是为了保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，扶植坏人上台当政，为他复辟资本主义准备社会基础。
    他们在桃园保护的重点人物就是党内走资本主义道路的当权派关景东。
    关景东出身中农，父亲是个经纪人，本人从学校出来就当干部。一九五四年带着浓厚的自发资本主义倾向混进了党内。
    一九五五年任初级社主任时，因破坏春耕生产，违反政府法令私杀耕牛，受到党内警告处分。在初级社转高级社时，又违反党的政策，变卖生产资料，把两头骡子，一辆胶轮大车，卖款私分。当高级社主任时，他又利用职权，私抽入社股金。他一再破坏合作化运动的行为，遭到广大群众的反对。有人说：“关景东这样挖社会主义墙脚，是无心干社会主义的。”
    一九五八年，关景东和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派挂上了钩。这年秋天，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，来到卢王庄高级社，大刮浮夸风。他指着地里的高粱问关景东：“多穗高粱最高每亩能产多少斤？”关景东答：“能产一万斤。”又问：“还能不能再高些，能产一万五千斤吗？”关景东说：“尽量争取。”于是这个浮夸风的祖师爷、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派连连点头称赞说：“那就好了。”这时，他的老婆王××立即掏出笔记本，把关景东等人的名字记了下来。不久，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派送来了电影机和种猪、种兔等，声称作为“股金”，全家入了关所在的高级社，捞了一个“名誉社员”的头衔。
    同年，人民公社建立后，关景东去北京向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派汇报建社情况，成了他家的座上客。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派向关景东大讲黑话，疯狂攻击人民公社。他说：“人民公社是不是建得太匆忙了？”“太匆忙是要跌跤的。没有群众基础，早晚也要垮台。”“办事不要凭脑子一热就办。”这些黑话，充分暴露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是反对人民公社的罪魁祸首。
    关景东从党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派那里领受黑指示回来之后，反动气焰格外嚣张，恶毒攻击人民公社。他胡说什么：“公社不如合作社，合作社不如互助组。”又说：“我家单干的时候，粮食有的是，愿意卖多少就卖多少，钱没有憋住过。”他还说：“队越小越好，人多心不齐，地多不长粮，人多出懒蛋。”
    一九五九年到“四清”以前，关景东先后窃踞了卢王庄公社一分支（相当于大队支部）副书记、公社采购员、桃园大队民兵连长、治保主任等职。在这期间，他常常打着党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的招牌，利用职权，大干坏事：
    1、贪污盗窃。关景东的贪污盗窃不仅是大队干部中数量最大的，而且情节极其恶劣。在高级社当副主任时，他多次偷油偷面，有一次偷油之后，为了洗刷罪责，竟限令治保副股长五天破案。在当民兵连长时，和大队长、副支书关××勾结，大偷玉米。还和反革命分子岳绍田跑到邻队去偷棉花。在任公社采购员期间，偷公社的铜线一百多斤，被抓住后，停职反省了十八天。在三年经济困难时期，利用职权明抢暗偷，派大车往家里拉粮拉菜，生产队里照顾孕妇、病人的细粮他也拿走，甚至幼儿园小孩田间拣回的小麦也要去吃了。他还以极低的代价，强行霸占已归生产队集体所有的地主房屋两间半。
    2、投机倒把。一九六○年，关景东勾结大贪污犯祖××，盗用公社名义，骗取唐山铁路工务段支援公社木材，高价变卖分赃。一九六一年，队里买小猪给社员养猪积肥，他乘机从中倒卖牟利。同年，又借卖大队薯秧的机会，进行投机倒把，获暴利五百多元。
    3、聚赌抽头。关景东从一九五三年起就聚赌抽头。他赌的次数最多，款数最大。仅一九六一年、一九六二年就赌博二百余次，抽头达数百元。一九五七年任高级社副主任时，他还利用职权，设赌抓赌，把自己输掉的钱捞回来。当上级警告他时，他说：“我不耍钱不行，宁可不要党籍也要耍钱。”
    4、横行霸道，欺压贫下中农。关景东依仗权势，打骂群众多人。有一次他竟和他的堂兄关××一起组织几个四类分子毒打贫农王兆荣，打得王身上青一块紫一块，血肉模糊。
    5、拉拢腐蚀干部，阴谋篡夺支部领导权。关景东对上吹拍逢迎，送礼行贿，对下腐蚀拉拢。为了巴结上边的一个干部，他多次请吃请喝，还送去花生、豆子、猪肉等。他钻进桃园支部以后，经常拉拢几个干部，从大队拿油拿面，大吃大喝。他身为治保主任，对四类分子竟然三年不开一次训话会。支部书记吴臣埋头苦干，他反而攻击吴臣“揽权过多”。在支部内，他两面三刀，挑拨离间，拉一批人，打一批人，千方百计要把吴臣整下台。他曾对人说：“不把吴臣整下台，我不姓关。”
    对关景东这样一个坏家伙，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的老婆王××，却是不遗余力地保他过关，扶他上台。
    王××到桃园不久，在一个戒备森严的小屋里，取下了头巾和大口罩，和关景东见面。关景东说：“我犯了错误，对不起×××（指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派）。”王××说：“你不要怕，你过去的情况，我都知道，我很信任你，我保你下楼，从轻处理。”
    为保关景东过关上台当政，王××大耍反革命两面手法：
    定调子。广大贫下中农说：“关景东是桃园的害人虫，他的问题最大。”王××却说：“看问题不能那么看，问题大的还是吴臣。”有些人向工作组检举了关景东的一些严重问题，王××不仅不让追，不让斗，还叫工作组向广大群众保密。
    出点子。王××对关景东说：“你交代的问题能不能站住脚？你准备准备，我要派对你有意见的人去调查，让他们自己打自己的嘴巴。”关景东领会了她的意思，赶忙同合伙搞投机倒把的人订了攻守同盟。
    搭梯子。群众刚刚开始揭发关景东的问题，王××就急急忙忙叫关景东带头在公社三级干部会上检查，帮他下楼过关。王××亲自替他修改检讨稿。
    拉上台。选举干部开始，王××提出要安排关景东当大队长，遭到了广大干部和贫下中农的激烈反对。她就抬出党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派来说：“这个问题，我给××去过信。××说，‘还是关景东当大队长’。”接着召开了三次党支部大会，强令党员保证关景东当选。
    关景东当上大队长以后，又经王××批准，把因犯了严重错误，在“四清”前夕已被撤职的他的堂兄关××，重新拉上台，当上了大队治保主任。又把民愤极大的岳绍田，提拔为大队治保副主任。从此，关景东等一小撮在王××工作组的支撑之下，把持了桃园的党政大权，对贫下中农实行资产阶级专政。
    六、大搞独立王国，实行资产阶级专政
    一、打着资产阶级司令部的黑旗，散布修正主义毒素
    王××在桃园，不放过一切机会大肆吹捧党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。无论大会小会，她开口就是“××指示”，“××派我来的”，“××对大家很关心”，“××给你们撑腰”。对于王××这种无耻吹捧，社员们非常愤怒，他们说：“王××来桃园搞四清，张口闭口总是×××（指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派），就是不提我们伟大领袖毛主席。”
    王××在整个“蹲点”过程中，从来不组织社员学习毛主席著作，却到处贩卖《修养》黑货。她经常散布党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级人生哲学。她动员干部退赔时说：“退赔了几个钱，经济上吃点小亏，取得了群众的拥护和信任，还选你当干部，到头来占个大便宜。”
    王××厚颜无耻地到处吹嘘她同社员“同吃、同住、同劳动”，其实她的所谓“三同”，完全是骗人的鬼话。她东挑西拣，选了一栋清洁僻静的厢房作宿舍，专派了公安处长等四个人给她保驾。她在社员家吃饭，“蜻蜓点水”，应付两口，回到宿舍，大吃鸡蛋、花生、高级点心。装装样子“劳动”一下，也要跟上一个照相的，这里摸摸，那里转转，照完相就走。并把这些假“三同”的相片大量散发给社员。在大队、公社以及县领导机关的办公室，也挂起了王××的照片。凡是她装模作样“劳动”过一下的地方，以及她住过的地方都分别竖起了纪念牌。招徕了国内外近万人的参观，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和她自己树碑立传，捞取政治资本。
    二、对外严密封锁，对内加强控制
    王××唯恐她搞的假四清、真复辟阴谋败露，离开桃园以后，专门搞了个“巩固组”，为她看“点”，把持桃园党政大权。“巩固组”设有专线电话，直通北京，接受党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和王××的遥控指挥。
    王××特别关照“巩固组”和她的亲信说：“桃园是‘中央’的点，是××的点”，“我和××是支持你们的，是给你们撑腰的。”“桃园的四清经验传出去了，我怕的就是你们顶不住。”“今后不论哪级干部来，他们要是不信任桃园‘群众’，就把他顶回去！”
    在王××一手遮天的反动统治下，对桃园的事情，别人只能说好，不能说坏。县、区很多干部都不敢过问。在布置工作的时候，往往要加上一句话：“桃园可根据本村情况自行安排。”
    吴臣问题始终是王××的一块心病。“巩固组”的一个重要任务，就是镇压吴臣不准翻案。每次评审四类分子，都把吴臣作为重点，并布置四类分子对他严密监视。一九六四年秋天，王××专门找原桃园“四清”工作组长说：“今后时间长了，坏分子可能翻案，这个问题你可得注意，要是忘记，桃园出了问题，我那报告已经出去了，就会出问题的。”又说：“千万不能让他们翻案呀！”
    地、县监委派人到桃园核实吴臣的问题，王××知道后勃然大怒说：“这些人吃了喝了不干事，就是给四不清翻案！”县监委的干部，竟因此被迫作了多次检讨。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派还亲自出马，就“四清”复查问题，对中央监委说：“监委审批只有同意，不许翻案，有的可以加重，不许减轻。这样做，有的人可能冤枉些，如果冤枉就再让他冤枉一两年再说。”
    三、培植亲信爪牙，竭力巩固资产阶级反动统治
    关景东等一小撮坏人，在王××扶植上台以后，遭到社员们强烈反对。
    王××明知她的爪牙关景东很不得人心，便格外嘱咐他说：“今后你要把一帮人团结住。”
    “四清”后，有的根本不够党员条件的“根子”，很快发展入党。由王××一手扶植起来的大队贫协主席，本来在群众中没有威信，但在王××的一再指令下，硬是拉入党内。
    王××和她的亲信对敢于斗争和反抗的革命群众，采取了种种手段，进行打击和迫害。
    有一个共产党员在一九六二年就写信向上级检举过关景东的问题，“四清”中又进一步作了揭发。“四清”后，被加上了打击“好干部”的罪名，整了三个晚上，并给了党内警告处分。
    有一个社员对关景东倚仗职权欺压群众不满。一九六五年二月，队里死了一头牛，关景东就趁机嫁祸于他，别有用心地说他的家庭成份有问题，是有意破坏，暗中煽动人要把他的成份由中农提高到富农，借以压制许多敢于反抗的人。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，王××的爪牙关景东等疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，残酷镇压革命群众。
    为了转移斗争大方向，他们利用地主分子栽赃诬陷，把一个犯有错误早已作了处理的下台干部拉出来，当作走资本主义道路当权派来斗。私设公堂，严刑吊打，整了三十八天。并把他七十多岁的姑妈扒光衣服，毒打逼供，致使重伤，终于死亡。
    北京等地革命小将来桃园串连，王××的亲信威胁群众说，学生问到“四清”情况，只准说好，不准说坏，谁说错了谁负责任。他们还对革命小将盯梢监视。
    王××的爪牙关景东狂妄叫嚣：“这里是桃园，不是北京，在桃园就得听我的！”
    七、大刮经济主义黑风，美化桃园，对抗大寨，破坏社会主义经济
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级分子王××，在桃园还大刮经济主义黑风，破坏社会主义经济。企图给桃园披上一件虚假繁荣的外衣，以他们的所谓“桃园点”，对抗大寨精神，同毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召唱对台戏。
    王××曾狂妄地说：“全国都在学大寨，桃园要在政治上超过大寨，叫全国也要学习桃园。”
    他们利用窃取的政治特权，硬把国家的钱，国家的东西，拿到桃园来。把全民所有，变为小集体所有。
    为了美化王××的“桃园点”，先后修了两个电力扬水站，两个电力扬水点，三眼机井。同时，架设了通向桃园的高压输电线四十二里，低压配电线三十四里，开挖了一条六里长的灌溉干渠。为了招揽外人参观和王××行车方便，还专修了一条九里长的“娘娘路”。这些工程，共占用国家建设资金六十四万四千元。群众说：“王××蹲点，是腰里揣着钱来的。”
    桃园大队的水利建设，本来应该按自力更生、经费自筹的方针办事。王××来桃园后，听说没有给桃园安排水利投资，大为不满，指责县水利科“不支持四清，与四清对抗”。原水利科长仅仅做了一点解释，背后说了一句“中央来的首长也得按政策办事”，就触犯了王××的“尊严”，遭到政治迫害，扣上“给四清刮冷风”的帽子，停职反省九个月，最后被撤职。
    由于王××在桃园“蹲点”，在物资供应上，竟然出现了这样一条奇怪的规定：“满足需要，及时供应，优先桃园。”
    国家调拨的化肥，除了在县里分配时就已经特殊照顾以外，还从省里直接调拨。邻队社员说：“桃园施肥大把抓，我们施肥用手掐。”“桃园地里的化肥水，流到我们地里也长好庄稼。”
    桃园要耕地，按合同正在给邻队耕地的拖拉机也要调来；桃园要打麦子，邻队正在使用的打麦机也要抽来；桃园要灭虫，邻队正在使用的喷雾器也要调来“支援”。理由是：“别的队减产没关系，桃园减产就交代不了。”“要保王××的点。”
    反革命经济主义严重腐蚀了群众的革命意志，助长了单纯依赖国家的思想。在一九六四年到一九六六年的三年中，虽然国家大量投资，水电设备样样俱全，但生产很不稳定。一九六六年产量大幅度下降，比一九六五年减产三成。
    “四清”前，桃园大队年年超额完成国家粮食征购任务。而在“四清”后的三年中，有两年没有完成国家征购任务。王××“蹲点”所在的第四生产队，“四清”前是个余粮队，一九六四年因粮食减产，口粮下降，王××逼着国家粮站，把已经征购入库的粮食又退回了一万八千斤。
    国家投资设备的折旧费无力按比例逐年扣除，国家贷款还逐年增加。社员们说，“这实际上是把国家的钱拿来分红了。”
    桃园大队社员们，身受反革命经济主义的祸害，看穿了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级分子王××的反动面目。他们说：“王妖婆搞四清，生产越搞越不中。光搞物质刺激打强心针，把国家钱撒在桃园，破坏社会主义经济，害了社员，损了集体，坑了国家。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。桃园大队贫下中农和革命群众、革命干部起来造反了！造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反！造资产阶级分子王××的反！造资产阶级反动路线的反！
    桃园大队的革命造反派揪出了王××一手扶植上台的桃园大队党内走资本主义道路的当权派关景东。
    不久前，在解放军支左、支农部队的支援下，在桃园举行了万人大会。革命造反派和受到迫害的革命干部、革命群众，愤怒控诉了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和王××在桃园犯下的滔天罪行。
    革命群众为吴臣、赵树椿同志彻底平了反。
    桃园大队的革命群众决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，抓革命促生产，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派推行的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清王××“桃园经验”的流毒，彻底粉碎他们复辟资本主义的大阴谋，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把桃园大队建设成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。　《解放军报》记者　新华社记者
