Revolutionary masses of the foreign trade system held a rally today to strongly protest against the Japanese Sato reactionary government's sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendly trade and to warmly welcome the return of the equipment inspection and training group from Japan. Some Japanese friends in Beijing also attended the meeting.

China Technology Import Corporation, in accordance with the contract signed with two Japanese trading companies, sent the equipment inspection and training group to Japan in June this year. The Sato government of Japan brazenly refused to extend the stay of the training group in Japan on August 29. Our training group comrades have already returned to Beijing.

Today's meeting was organized by China Technology Import Corporation. The responsible person of China Technology Import Corporation, representatives of the training group to Japan, and representatives from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the China-Japan Friendship Association, the Liaozhengzhi Office, and the capital's trade circles spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the Sato government of Japan's unreasonable refusal to handle the extension of the stay visa for our training group is another new crime of their madly pursuing a pro-American, pro-Soviet, anti-China policy, sabotaging friendly exchanges and economic exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. They said that the peoples of China and Japan must join hands and resolutely fight against the Sato reactionary government to safeguard and develop friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

Representatives from various organizations of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and representatives from friendly Japanese trading companies also spoke at the meeting. They strongly protested against the Sato government's sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendly trade and expressed their determination to join the broad masses of the Japanese people in resolutely fighting against the Sato government that sabotages Sino-Japanese friendship and defending Sino-Japanese friendly trade.

During the meeting, the entire audience repeatedly shouted slogans such as: "Down with the Sato government!" "Strongly protest against the Sato government's sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendly trade!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

    我对外贸易系统革命群众集会抗议佐藤政府破坏中日贸易罪行
    热烈欢迎赴日设备检验实习组同志胜利归来
    新华社十六日讯　对外贸易系统革命群众今天集会强烈抗议日本佐藤反动政府破坏中日友好贸易的罪行，热烈欢迎赴日设备检验实习组的同志胜利回到北京。在北京的一些日本朋友也出席了大会。
    中国技术进口总公司根据和日本两个商社签订的合同规定，曾在今年六月派出设备检验实习组赴日本。日本佐藤政府在八月二十九日悍然拒绝日本两商社要求延长实习组在日本居留的期限。我实习组同志已于日前回到北京。
    今天的大会是由中国技术进口总公司主办。中国技术进口总公司负责人，赴日本实习组代表和中国国际贸易促进委员会、中日友协、廖承志办事处、首都贸易界的代表先后在大会上讲话。他们指出，日本佐藤政府无理拒绝办理我实习组延长居留签证手续，是它们疯狂奉行亲美联苏反华政策，破坏中日两国人民友好往来和经济往来的又一新的罪行。他们说，中日两国人民一定要携起手来，和佐藤反动政府进行坚决斗争，为维护和发展中日两国人民友好往来而奋斗。
    在北京的日本国际贸易促进协会各团体代表和日本友好商社代表也在大会上讲话。他们强烈抗议佐藤政府破坏日中友好贸易的罪行，表示要同日本广大人民一起，向破坏日中友好的佐藤政府展开坚决斗争，捍卫日中友好贸易。
    在大会进行中，全场不断高呼：“打倒佐藤政府！”“强烈抗议佐藤政府破坏中日友好贸易！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
