Revolutionary masses of the State Sports Commission have raised the banner of revolution and launched a total attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in the sports world, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist sports line they have been pushing.

For the past seventeen years, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the sports world has been sharp and intense. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always shown deep concern for the people's sports and has given many extremely important instructions on sports work. As early as 1952, Chairman Mao called on the whole nation to "develop sports and strengthen the people's physique." In 1953, he again clearly instructed that "sports are a major issue concerning the health of 600 million people." In 1960, he proposed that "as long as it is possible, we should promote physical exercises, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming, Tai Chi, and various other sports." Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on sports have laid down a brilliant revolutionary line for proletarian sports, pointed out the correct direction for sports to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the people at large, and proposed the fundamental principles and tasks of socialist sports. Whether or not these instructions are firmly carried out is the dividing line between whether sports work is on the socialist road or the capitalist road. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with their agents in the sports world, have always fiercely resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On March 9, 1956, China's Khrushchev gathered the counter-revolutionary revisionists who had taken over the sports world and peddled the theory of the extinction of class struggle, saying such things as "because of the high prestige of our Party among the masses and the victory of the Chinese revolution, the problem of losing leadership among the masses no longer exists today." He also said, "Now, sports have developed into a national affair." He advocated class cooperation with the bourgeoisie, proposing that "as long as they are not counter-revolutionaries or other bad elements, we should cooperate well with them." He openly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, turning sports into a bourgeois pastime, saying things like "seeing athletes makes one's heart happy." He did everything he could to limit the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from participating in sports activities, maliciously saying, "Mass movements must be careful, first solve the problem of the masses' livelihood, otherwise, the more enthusiastically you play, the louder their cries will be." For more than a decade, the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party in the sports world, following the instructions of their chief backer, have vigorously pushed the revisionist sports line, attempting to bring proletarian sports into the track of capitalist restoration.

The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party who have taken over the sports world, under the "instructions" of their chief backer, openly defied Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on strengthening the people's physique and did everything they could to limit and strangle mass sports. They only promoted "elite" sports teams serving a small handful of people, not mass sports serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The State Sports Commission had only three or four cadres in charge of mass sports work. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the sports world fiercely opposed the development of rural sports, slandering the correct opinion of actively promoting rural sports as an "anti-Party program." In 1958, under the guidance of the Party's general line, mass sports saw an unprecedentedly vigorous and gratifying situation, but they slandered it as "mobilizing the masses" and "going too far," shouting that "the success of sports work should be measured by how many world records and world championships you have. 'Broadcast gymnastics can be done as well as possible, but it won't produce international results.'" They used this to stubbornly resist Chairman Mao's fundamental principle of "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique."

During the past revolutionary war period, Chairman Mao taught us, "The whole Party must pay attention to war, learn military affairs, and prepare for battle." After victory, we still need to strengthen our preparedness and prevent imperialist aggression. In January 1960, the Military Commission held a meeting to discuss national defense sports work and proposed that "the National Defense Sports Association is a mass sports organization serving national construction and national defense construction. Carrying out national defense sports work is an important part of realizing the goal of universal military training; widely carrying out mass national defense sports activities can cultivate and reserve a large number of technical soldiers and technical cadres for the army..." However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, through their agents in the sports world, fiercely resisted and attacked Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking and the Military Commission's resolutions, causing national defense sports to be discriminated against, squeezed out, and strangled. Since 1960, nearly 80% of the national defense sports grassroots organizations across the country have been cut. They also set frames and rules, tightly binding national defense sports within cities, not allowing them to go to the countryside or factories, doing everything they could to limit the broad masses of workers and peasants from participating in national defense sports activities, causing the national defense sports cause to suffer huge losses.

Chairman Mao taught us, "In addition to studying professional subjects, one must make progress in thought and politics, which requires studying Marxism and current affairs. Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." The handful of power-holders within the Party in the sports world who are taking the capitalist road, however, did the opposite, fiercely opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics and vigorously promoting the cult of victory, spreading the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of "just play ball, don't ask about politics" among the athletes. They openly shouted, "Politics without results is just blowing hot air," "What is the main contradiction here? First, it is the problem of how to improve results. Once this problem is solved, all other problems will be solved." In other words, with results, everything is solved. To make the teams achieve results, to achieve the despicable purpose of gaining political capital, they have always been promoting material incentives among the athletes, spreading the thoroughly revisionist ideas of "technique first," "fame first," and "money first," to corrupt our young generation; using "technique first," "victory first," "money first" to replace political leadership, using "results first," "elite first," "material first," and "ability first" to resist Comrade Lin Biao's proposal of the "four firsts," seriously hindering the ideological revolution and healthy growth of the youth.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with their agents in the sports world, have been vigorously pushing the revisionist sports line, plotting to restore capitalism, and committing countless crimes. In the current great criticism of the revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries of the State Sports Commission are determined to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, closely combining the great criticism of the revolution with the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, closely combining the enthusiastic mass criticism activities with the solid thematic criticism, thoroughly eliminating the poison of the revisionist sports line, and planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the entire sports world, flying it high and forever!

    国家体委系统革命群众向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发起总攻击
    狠揭狠批修正主义体育路线
    本报讯　国家体委系统的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举革命的批判大旗，向以中国赫鲁晓夫及其在体育界的代理人发起了总攻击，彻底批判他们所推行的修正主义体育路线。
    十七年来，体育界的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一直在尖锐地、激烈地进行着。我们伟大的领袖毛主席无限关怀人民的体育事业，对体育工作做了许多极其重要的指示。早在一九五二年，毛主席就向全国人民发出“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的伟大号召。一九五三年，毛主席再次明确指示：体育是关系六亿人民健康的大事。一九六○年，毛主席又提出：凡能做到的，都要提倡做体操，打球类，跑跑步，爬山，游水，打太极拳及各种各色的体育运动。毛主席关于体育运动的一系列英明指示，为无产阶级体育事业制定了一条光辉的革命路线，指明了体育为工农兵、为人民大众服务的正确方向，提出了社会主义体育运动的根本方针和任务。是不是坚决执行这些指示，是区别体育工作走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的分界线。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在体育界的代理人，一贯疯狂地抵制、对抗毛主席的革命路线。一九五六年三月九日，中国的赫鲁晓夫召集盘踞在体育界的反革命修正主义分子，大肆贩卖阶级斗争熄灭论，胡说什么“由于我们党在群众中的崇高威信和中国革命的胜利，今天在人民群众中丧失领导权的问题已经没有了。”又说：“现在体育已发展成为全民的事业。”他还鼓吹和资产阶级搞阶级合作，提出“只要不是反革命分子和其他坏分子都要很好地合作”。他公然对抗毛主席的革命路线，把体育变成资产阶级寻欢作乐的玩艺，如说什么“看到运动员，它使人心中愉快。”他竭力限制广大工农兵群众参加体育活动，恶毒地说：“群众运动要注意，先解决群众的生活问题，否则有人就会叫，你越玩得起劲，他们的叫声越高。”十多年来，体育界的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子依据这些黑指示，极力推行修正主义体育路线，妄图把无产阶级体育事业纳入资本主义复辟的轨道。
    盘踞在体育界的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在他们总后台的“指示”下，公然抗拒毛主席关于增强人民体质的一系列英明指示，千方百计地限制和扼杀群众体育。他们只搞为一小撮人服务的“尖子”运动队伍，不搞为工农兵而服务，为工农兵所利用的群众体育。国家体委只有三、四名干部负责经管群众体育工作。体育界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，疯狂反对开展农村体育运动，把主张积极开展农村体育运动的正确意见，诬为“反党纲领”。一九五八年，在党的总路线照耀下，群众性体育运动出现了空前蓬勃的可喜局面，他们却诬蔑说“这是运动群众”，“搞过头了”，大叫什么“体育工作有没有成绩，要看你有几个世界纪录，几个世界冠军。”“广播操搞得再好，也出不了国。”以此来顽固地抵制毛主席所制定的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的根本方针。
    在过去革命战争时期，毛主席曾教导我们：“全党都要注重战争，学习军事，准备打仗。”胜利以后，我们仍然需要加强战备，防止帝国主义侵略。一九六○年一月，军委召开会议讨论了国防体育工作，提出“国防体育协会是为国家建设和国防建设服务的群众性体育组织，开展国防体育工作，是实现全民皆兵的重要内容之一；广泛开展群众性的国防体育活动，可以为部队培养、储备大批技术兵员和技术干部……。”可是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，通过他们在体育界的代理人，对毛主席的伟大战略思想，对军委的决议疯狂抵制，横加攻击，使国防体育遭到歧视、排挤和扼杀。从一九六○年以来，全国的国防体育基层组织被砍掉了近百分之八十。他们还划框框、定条条，把国防体育死死地束缚在城市里，不许下农村，进工厂，千方百计限制广大工农群众参加国防体育活动，使国防体育事业受到巨大损失。
    毛主席教导我们：“除了学习专业之外，在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步，这就需要学习马克思主义，学习时事政治。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”盘踞在体育界的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派却反其道而行之，极力反对突出无产阶级政治，大肆宣扬锦标主义，在运动员队伍中极力宣扬“只打球，不问政治”的反革命修正主义谬论。公然叫嚣：“不出成绩的政治是瞎吹牛”，“我们这里的主要矛盾是什么？首先是解决如何提高成绩的问题，这个问题解决了，其它一切问题就迎刃而解了。”一句话，有了成绩就有了一切。他们为了使运动队出成绩，以达到捞取政治资本的卑劣目的，一向在运动员队伍中大搞物质刺激，宣扬技术挂帅、名利第一的彻头彻尾的修正主义思想，来腐蚀我们的青年一代；用“技术挂帅”、“锦标挂帅”、“金钱挂帅”去取代政治挂帅，以“成绩第一”、“尖子第一”、“物质第一”、“才能第一”去抵制林彪同志提出的“四个第一”，严重阻碍了青年的思想革命化和健康成长。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在体育界的代理人，疯狂推行修正主义体育路线，阴谋复辟资本主义，罪行累累。在当前革命的大批判中，国家体委系统的无产阶级革命派，决心把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，使革命的大批判和活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动紧密结合起来，把轰轰烈烈的群众性的批判活动和扎扎实实的专题批判紧密结合起来，彻底肃清修正主义体育路线的流毒，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍整个体育界，高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
