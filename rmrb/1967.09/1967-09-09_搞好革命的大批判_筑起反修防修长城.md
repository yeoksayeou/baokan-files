	Conducting a thorough criticism of the revolution and building a great wall against revisionism
	China Medical University Red Guards Red Flag Commune

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "Criticizing Tao Zhu's Two Books" is like a sharp scalpel, stripping away the layers of disguise of the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu, exposing his ugly counter-revolutionary face in broad daylight. This is another heavy artillery shell in the complete destruction of the bourgeois headquarters. We, the revolutionary cadres of the medical system, have fought resolutely against this counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article has given us great encouragement and strength.

	The vast army of the proletarian cultural revolution, following the direction indicated by the great helmsman and the strategic deployment of the great commander, surges forward like a mighty torrent. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us:
	"In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make a last struggle against the revolutionary forces." The biggest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road do not resign themselves to their demise. They always stand on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, from the extreme "left" or right, to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, attempting to reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, and shift the direction of the struggle. But their plots will not succeed. They will always be crushed by the wheel of history. The counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu's performance in the cultural revolution once again proves this truth.

	Under the brilliant guidance of the May 16 Notification and under the personal leadership and initiation of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great proletarian cultural revolution has been launched nationwide. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have clearly directed their struggle at the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Just as the flames of the mass movement were sweeping towards the bourgeois headquarters, just as the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road were hating it to death, fearing it to death, and at a loss, the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu, with the mission of stabilizing the bourgeois headquarters, jumped out. As soon as he appeared, he brandished the big stick of the bourgeois reactionary line, openly appearing with a rightist face, advocating the slave mentality repeatedly advocated by the black book "Self-Cultivation." Even worse, on June 25 last year, Tao Zhu, in a notorious black report to the medical system, actually labeled the revolutionary masses as "fake leftists, real rightists," and slapped them with the "anti-party" hat; and in accordance with the will of the second biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, representing the bourgeois headquarters, usurping the name of the Party Central Committee, announced that the handful of power-holders within the Ministry of Health who are taking the capitalist road are "not a gang of black elements." He vouched for this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. He openly opposed Chairman Mao's great call to "shell the headquarters," attempting to disrupt Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, pulling the just-launched proletarian cultural revolution to the right, leading it astray.

	The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee declared the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved great victory. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses launched a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. The disadvantaged Tao Zhu, a representative of the exploiting class, "in order to protect their present existence for the sake of future development," again adopted the strategy of attacking to defend, eagerly jumping out, appearing with an extreme "leftist" face, everywhere deceiving and cheating. On August 23 last year, he came to the Medical University, spreading the reactionary idea of "doubt everything." He rambled on about how "doubting everything is correct in the cultural revolution," "anyone can oppose," attempting to stir up a current of shelling the proletarian headquarters, disrupting the direction of the struggle, muddying the waters, covering up the bourgeois headquarters, so that the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road could slip through.

	When his counter-revolutionary plot was foiled and his counter-revolutionary face was about to be exposed, Tao Zhu, in order to conceal his extremely empty mind, carefully tried to beautify himself, appearing everywhere with the posture of a very important "great figure" to scare people. On December 13 last year, in his speech to the medical system, he boasted, "I am basically a revolutionary of the proletariat," attempting to wash himself clean and escape. But the fox's tail cannot be hidden, and Mao Zedong Thought, which can discern the finest details, is a mirror that reveals demons! This counter-revolutionary two-faced person was finally exposed and knocked down by us.

	We, the revolutionary cadres of the medical system, have deeply felt from the struggle practice of the past year: closely following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is the most fundamental guarantee of our victory. Chairman Mao's strategic deployment has grasped the objective laws of acute and complex class struggle, embodying the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers. We, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, must closely follow it, not leaving it by an inch, and must firmly protect it as we protect our eyes.

	We, the broad revolutionary fighters, in the bloody struggle against Tao Zhu, this chameleon, have deeply felt: the most fundamental issue in the cultural revolution is the issue of the direction of the struggle, that is, the issue of whom the spearhead of the struggle is aimed at. The issue of whom the spearhead is aimed at is the most important issue in the cultural revolution. Only by aiming the spearhead correctly can we follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, not be used by class enemies, and always advance victoriously along the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Today, although Tao Zhu has been overthrown, the poison he spread of "doubting everything" has not been thoroughly eradicated. The "May 16" clique is the follower of Khrushchev and Tao Zhu in China. This handful of counter-revolutionaries use the slogan of "left in form, right in essence" to deceive some people, shelling the proletarian headquarters, attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Such reactionary organizations must be thoroughly exposed, immediately banned, and resolutely suppressed!

	We, the Red Guards and all revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, are determined to resolutely carry out the great battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters of Chairman Mao, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly fight down and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu and their agents in the medical system, building a great wall of steel against revisionism on the political and ideological front!

　　搞好革命的大批判　筑起反修防修长城

    姚文元同志的文章《评陶铸的两本书》，象一把犀利的解剖刀，剥去了陶铸这个反革命两面派的层层画皮，把他反革命的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下。这是彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的又一发重型炮弹。我们卫生系统无产阶级革命派和这个反革命两面派陶铸进行了坚决的战斗，姚文元同志的文章，给了我们极大的鼓舞和力量。
    浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，沿着伟大舵手指引的方向，按照伟大统帅的战略部署，如滚滚洪流，汹涌向前。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：
  “在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不甘心于自己的灭亡，总是站在资产阶级的反动立场上，从极“左”的或右的方面，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，妄想颠倒是非，混淆黑白，转移斗争的大方向。但是，他们的阴谋是不能得逞的，他们总是要被历史的巨轮碾得粉碎。反革命两面派陶铸在文化革命中的表演，又一次证明了这一真理。
    在五·一六《通知》的光辉照耀下，在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导和发动下，全国无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。亿万革命群众把斗争矛头明确地指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。正当群众运动的熊熊烈火扑向资产阶级司令部的时候，正当党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派恨得要死，怕得要命，手足无措的时候，反革命两面派陶铸，他担负着稳住资产阶级司令部阵脚的反革命使命跳了出来。他一露面，就挥舞资产阶级反动路线的大棒，公开以右的面目出现，提倡黑《修养》所一再提倡的奴隶主义。更甚的，到去年六月二十五日，陶铸在对卫生系统的一个臭名昭著的黑报告中，竟把革命群众打成“假左派、真右派”，扣上“反党”的帽子；并且秉承第二号党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，代表资产阶级司令部，盗用了党中央的名义，宣布卫生部党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“不是黑帮”。他为这一小撮反革命修正主义分子大打保票。他明目张胆地对抗毛主席发出的“炮打司令部”的伟大号召，企图打乱毛主席的战略部署，把刚刚发动起来的无产阶级文化大革命拉向右转，引入歧途。
    党的八届十一中全会，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大胜利。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众展开了对资产阶级反动路线的群众性大批判。处于不利地位的陶铸这个剥削阶级的代表人物，“为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展”，又采取了以攻为守的策略，迫不及待地跳了出来，以极“左”的面目，到处招摇撞骗。去年八月二十三日，他来到医大，大肆散布“怀疑一切”的反动思想。他胡说什么“文化大革命中，怀疑一切是正确的”，“任何人都可以反对”，企图掀起一股炮打无产阶级司令部的逆流，扰乱斗争大方向，把水搅混，掩护资产阶级司令部，好使党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派蒙混过关。
    当他的反革命阴谋遭到破产以后，在他的反革命面目即将暴露的时候，陶铸又极力掩饰他无比空虚的心理，处心积虑地美化自己，以很了不起的“大人物”姿态到处吓人。去年十二月十三日，他在对卫生系统的讲话中，自诩“我基本上是无产阶级革命家”，妄图洗刷自己，溜之大吉。但是，狐狸的尾巴是藏不住的，能够明察秋毫的毛泽东思想是照妖镜，一切魑魅魍魉都统统逃脱不掉！这个反革命两面派，终于被我们揪出来，打翻在地了。
    我们卫生系统的无产阶级革命派，从一年来斗争实践中深深地体会到：紧跟毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，是我们取得胜利的最根本保证。毛主席的战略部署抓住了尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的客观规律，体现了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益。我们无产阶级革命派必须紧紧跟上，要寸步不离，并且要象保护眼睛一样坚决保护它。
    我们广大革命战士，在同陶铸这个变色龙的浴血战斗中，还深深地体会到：文化大革命中最根本的一个问题是斗争大方向的问题，也就是斗争矛头指向谁的问题。矛头对准谁，这个大是大非的问题，是文化大革命最最重要的问题。斗争矛头指准了，才能紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，才能不为阶级敌人所利用，永远沿着毛主席所指引的航道胜利前进。
    今天，虽然陶铸被打倒了，但是他所散布的“怀疑一切”的流毒还没有彻底肃清。“五·一六”这个阴谋小集团，就是中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸的追随者。这一小撮反革命分子用形“左”实右的口号，蒙蔽了一些人，炮打无产阶级司令部，妄想破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。对这样的反动组织必须彻底揭露，立即取缔，坚决镇压！
    我们红卫兵小将和全体无产阶级革命派决心最最坚决地执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部发出的伟大战斗号令，集中火力，集中目标，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国的赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸以及他们在卫生系统的代理人彻底斗倒斗臭，批深批透，在政治思想战线上筑起一道反修防修的钢铁长城！
