In the midst of the high tide of revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside of Shandong Province are full of vigor and vitality. They have responded to the great call of Chairman Mao, the great leader, to "grasp revolution and promote production," and with high revolutionary enthusiasm, they have actively engaged in the current busy autumn production, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year and laying a solid foundation for the bumper harvest of summer grain next year.

This year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside of Shandong Province have, through the Cultural Revolution, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasping revolution and promoting production." Based on the relatively good harvest in the summer, they have achieved a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops in the autumn. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To ensure the smooth progress of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, the provincial revolutionary committee's production command department and many county and municipal revolutionary committees (preparatory groups) have recently held autumn production meetings to further implement autumn production work. At present, the majority of the labor force in various communes across the province has been organized in an orderly manner to engage in autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. They adhere to the principle of working during the day and engaging in revolution during leisure time, getting up early and working late, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," striving for quick harvest, quick threshing, and quick delivery, and completing the autumn sowing task on time. Leading cadres at all levels have also organized a large number of cadres to go to the front lines of autumn production, vigorously promoting revolution and production. Some places have even established autumn production leading groups composed of stationed troops, revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary leading cadres to strengthen the leadership of autumn production. Various places have also paid special attention to strengthening the work of the militia to protect the autumn harvest and prevent the sabotage activities of class enemies.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong Province has provided strong support for local autumn production. Many agricultural support troops have sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the front lines of agricultural production, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and the great line of "grasping revolution and promoting production," greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in autumn production. Industrial, commercial, and financial departments are also providing strong support for autumn production.

Now, the early autumn crops in the province have all been harvested, and the late autumn crops have also begun to be harvested one after another. The area of autumn plowing has reached more than 80 million mu, and the northern regions of Dezhou, Huimin, and others have begun to sow.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Harbin on the 20th, following the bumper harvest of spring wheat this year, Heilongjiang Province has now brought good news from the autumn harvest front: the province's more than 80 million mu of soybeans, corn, millet, sorghum, and other autumn crops have also been harvested. According to preliminary investigations, the total production of grain, beans, and potatoes is approximately 10% higher than last year. This is a victory of Chairman Mao's great line of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This year, the members of the people's communes in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province and the workers of state farms have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasping revolution and promoting production," and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, overcome various natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region recently issued instructions, calling on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, farm workers, and revolutionary cadres in the countryside across the province to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the great criticism as a driving force, and concentrate all efforts on the autumn harvest. They are to harvest carefully, collect every grain, and complete the autumn harvest production tasks at high standards, high quality, high speed, and on time and comprehensively. The instructions especially point out: the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, farm workers, and revolutionary cadres in the countryside across the province should closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide autumn production, and ensure that with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," all efforts are concentrated on rushing to harvest; seriously propagate and implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "frugality in revolution," be thrifty and oppose waste; and while engaging in autumn production, do a good job in preparing for next year's production and agricultural infrastructure construction.

　　毛泽东思想的胜利　文化大革命的硕果
　　山东省粮食棉花和油料作物大丰收

    据新华社济南十八日电　在革命大批判的高潮中，山东广大贫下中农和农村革命干部英姿焕发，以实际行动响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，鼓足革命干劲，积极投入当前繁忙的三秋生产，力争今年秋季农作物的大丰收，并为明年的夏粮丰收打下坚实可靠的基础。
    今年，山东广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，由于在文化大革命中，坚决贯彻执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在取得夏季较好收成的基础上，今年秋季又取得了粮、棉、油料作物的大丰收。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    为了切实做好秋收、秋耕、秋种工作，省革委会生产指挥部和很多地、县革委会（筹备小组），最近都召开了三秋工作会议，进一步落实了三秋工作。目前，各地人民公社的绝大部分劳力都有秩序地投入秋收、秋耕、秋种前线。他们坚持白天搞生产，业余闹革命，起早贪黑，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，力争快收快打快交售和适时完成秋播任务。各级领导班子也都组织了大批干部，深入三秋生产第一线，狠抓革命，猛促生产。有的地方还建立了由驻军、革命群众组织和革命领导干部组成的三秋生产领导班子，加强对三秋工作的领导。各地还特别注意加强民兵工作，保卫秋收，严防阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    驻山东省的人民解放军大力支援当地的三秋生产。由许多支农部队派出的毛泽东思想宣传队深入到农业生产第一线，大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的革命路线和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大大调动了广大贫下中农搞好三秋生产的积极性。工交、财贸等部门也在大力支援三秋生产。
    现在，全省早秋作物已经全部登场，晚秋作物也相继开始收割，秋耕面积已达八百多万亩，北部的德州、惠民等地已开始播种。
    新华社哈尔滨二十日电　黑龙江省继夺得今年春小麦丰收之后，现在秋收第一线又传来振奋人心的喜讯：全省八千多万亩大豆、玉米、谷子、高粱等大秋作物，又获得了好收成。据初步调查，粮、豆、薯总产量约比去年增产一成左右。这是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
