Revolutionary masses across the country, including the proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses, continue to earnestly study and discuss the important editorial published in the People's Daily on September 14, "In the Great Criticism, Greatly Promote the Great Unity." The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses are excited and declare: At this crucial moment when a great wave of revolutionary criticism is sweeping the nation, our great leader Chairman Mao has once again timely pointed out the direction for our victory. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, learn from the example of the proletarian workers of Shanghai's Zhabei District, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, eliminate factionalism, sweep away selfishness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve and strengthen revolutionary unity in the great criticism, and seize even greater victories in the Cultural Revolution!

Revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses across the country point out that the editorial of the People's Daily conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which are an extremely important call to us by our great leader in the current favorable situation. We must earnestly study, thoroughly understand, and resolutely implement them. The leader of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Defense of Mao Zedong Thought Combat Headquarters excitedly said: We fully support and will implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We will not pursue those who were previously misled and opposed us. To thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, we must further promote revolutionary unity and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The fighters of Henan's "September 7th Commune," Kaifeng's "August 24th," Changsha's "Hunan Workers' Union," and "Xiangjiang Thunder" have resolved to take the revolutionary workers of Shanghai's Zhabei District as their example and achieve revolutionary unity as quickly as possible in the wave of great criticism. The workers of Changsha Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant's Workers' Union said: We, the working class, have a common enemy, common goals, and common tasks. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, we, the working class, must unite, march in step, and jointly complete the glorious task of revolutionary criticism. After studying the editorial, the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards of Nanning region have made decisions related to promoting unity, with comrades of different views writing to each other and holding discussions, expressing their determination to promote revolutionary unity in the great criticism.

Class enemies are most afraid of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries and always try to sabotage our revolutionary unity. Revolutionary masses across the country declare that the more the enemy fears the revolutionary masses uniting and rallying together, the more we must vigorously promote revolutionary unity in the great criticism. The broad proletarian revolutionary fighters of Wuhan region say that China's Khrushchev and the likes of Tao Zhu and Wang Renzhong are not "dead tigers." We must remember Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unite more closely, launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism, concentrate our firepower, focus our targets, and criticize and expose these elements thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory. Overcoming numerous obstacles, the fighters of the Jingan Mountain Corps of Nanchang's Hongdu Machinery Factory, which has formed a unified revolutionary organization across the entire factory, said in a discussion: There are no irreconcilable conflicts of interest within the working class. Our real enemies are the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. This handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of us, the working class, uniting. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support," we proletarian revolutionaries must unite and bury this handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in the vast sea of the people's war of revolutionary criticism. The broad proletarian revolutionary fighters of Hefei region say that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the primary task at present is to carry out the great criticism and further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity. The split and opposition among revolutionary mass organizations are the result of the sabotage, manipulation, and incitement by the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. In our ranks, there are also people who put factional interests above party interests and small group interests above proletarian interests. We must stay vigilant and never fall for the enemy's tricks.

Revolutionary masses and revolutionary fighters across the country emphasize that to carry out the great criticism and further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity, we must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, prioritize the overall interests of the revolution and proletarian party spirit, and strive to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. The revolutionary fighters of the Dongfanghong Combat Column of Inner Mongolia Normal University said: The process of achieving revolutionary unity in our school is also a process of continually overcoming the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, a process of breaking down "selfishness" and establishing "public spirit." Only by continually arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and continually carrying out self-revolution can we effectively resist the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies and timely expose the enemy's sabotage plots. The fighters of Gansu's "Red Three Commands" Workers' United Combat Headquarters said that the working class must have a sense of the whole, must have high morale and high posture, and carry out the revolution according to Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, striving to be models of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and "grasp the revolution, promote production." The revolutionary fighters of Hangzhou said that internal strife within the working class only causes pain to friends and joy to enemies. No matter how many reasons you have, you must submit to the great logic of revolutionary criticism and unity, submit to the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought. In addition to being vigilant against the enemy's sabotage and plots at all times, the proletarian revolutionaries especially need to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, break down "selfishness," establish "public spirit," overcome factionalism, enhance party spirit, and fiercely struggle against the "I" in our minds—"I am the center," "I am the core," "I am the old revolutionary"—and expose the wind of seeking fame, factionalism, sectarianism, and small-groupism.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army engaged in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" frontline, after studying the great leader Chairman Mao's latest teachings, excitedly said: The new battle call issued by the highest commander Chairman Mao to the proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses is also a new battle mobilization order for us participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. We must widely and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's battle call, widely and deeply propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought, and make new contributions to promoting the proletarian revolutionaries to achieve and strengthen revolutionary unity and further carry out the great criticism. In Shanghai's Third Steel Plant, the propaganda team of a certain unit supporting the leftist cause has made contributions to promoting the unity of the factory's revolutionaries. After entering the factory, they often studied "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with the leaders and revolutionary masses of the ten revolutionary mass organizations in the factory, helping the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to consciously use the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to break down the "selfishness" in their minds, raise class consciousness, achieve revolutionary unity, and launch a more vigorous and practical new wave of revolutionary criticism. They linked their work in the previous stage, earnestly studied the editorial of the People's Daily, and deeply felt that: No matter how much support there is, the greatest and most fundamental support is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Once the broad revolutionary masses are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will follow the course set by Chairman Mao and seize one victory after another.

    各地无产阶级革命派决心向上海闸北区工人阶级学习
    铲除山头，横扫“私”字，争当革命大联合的模范
    据新华社十五日讯　全国各地广大无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众继续认真学习、讨论《人民日报》九月十四日发表的重要社论《在革命的大批判中大力促进革命的大联合》。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众激动地表示：在全国兴起革命大批判高潮的重要时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席又一次及时地向我们指明了胜利前进的方向。我们一定坚决按照毛主席的伟大教导，学习上海闸北区工人阶级的榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，铲除山头，横扫“私”字，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命的大批判中实现和加强革命的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命更加辉煌的新胜利！
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众指出，《人民日报》社论传达的毛主席的最新指示，是我们伟大领袖在当前大好形势下向我们发出的极为重要的号召。我们一定要认真学习，好好领会，坚决照办。鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部负责人兴奋地说：毛主席的最新指示，我们一千个拥护，一万个照办。过去受蒙蔽的群众和我们闹对立，我们一概不究。为了彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人，我们要进一步搞好革命的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。河南“二七公社”、开封“八二四”和“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”的战士，决心以上海闸北区的革命工人为榜样，在大批判的高潮中尽快实现革命的大联合。长沙汽车配件制造厂的工联战士说：我们工人阶级有共同的敌人、共同的目标、共同的任务，在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，我们工人阶级必须联合起来，步调一致，共同完成革命大批判的光荣任务。南宁地区无产阶级革命派和红卫兵革命小将学习了社论以后，纷纷作出有关促进大联合的“决定”，不同观点的同志相互写信，在一起座谈，表示决心要在革命大批判中促进革命大联合。
    阶级敌人最害怕无产阶级革命派的大联合，他们总是想方设法要破坏我们的革命大联合。各地无产阶级革命派表示，敌人越是害怕革命群众联合起来团结起来，我们就越是要在革命大批判中大力促进革命的大联合。武汉地区广大无产阶级革命派战士说，中国的赫鲁晓夫及陶铸、王任重之流决不是“死老虎”。我们只有牢记毛主席的最新指示，更加紧密地团结起来，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，才能集中火力，集中目标，把这些家伙从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透斗倒斗臭。冲破重重障碍，成立了全厂革命大联合统一组织的南昌国营洪都机械厂井冈山兵团战士，在座谈时说，我们工人阶级内部决没有什么不可调和的利害冲突，我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才是势不两立的死对头。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，最害怕我们工人阶级联合起来。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”，我们无产阶级革命派一定要联合起来，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派埋葬在革命大批判的“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。合肥地区广大无产阶级革命派的战士说，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在当前首要的就是搞好革命的大批判，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合。革命群众组织之间出现分裂，形成对立，这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地富反坏右挑拨、操纵和煽动的结果；在我们的队伍里也有的人派性高于党性、小团体利益高于无产阶级利益。我们必须提高警惕，切切不可上阶级敌人的当。
    各地无产阶级革命派、革命小将强调指出，要搞好革命的大批判，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合，必须进一步活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，把革命的全局利益和无产阶级的党性放在首要的地位，努力克服小资产阶级的派性。内蒙古师范学院东方红战斗纵队的革命小将说：我们学院实现革命大联合的过程，也是不断克服资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮侵蚀的过程，是大破“私”字、大立“公”字的过程。只有不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑，不断进行自我革命，才能有效地抵制资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮的侵蚀，及时识破阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。甘肃“红三司”工人联合战斗总部的战士说，我们工人阶级一定要有整体观念，一定要有高风格，高姿态，按照毛主席的战略部署闹革命，争作革命大批判的模范，革命大联合的模范，“抓革命，促生产”的模范。杭州无产阶级革命派战士说，工人阶级内部打“内战”，只能使亲者痛，仇者快，你有千条理、万条理，也要服从革命大批判、大联合这个大道理，服从毛泽东思想这个伟大真理。无产阶级革命派除了时刻警惕阶级敌人的挑拨、破坏阴谋以外，特别需要加强毛主席著作的学习，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，克服派性，增强党性，狠斗自己头脑中“以我为主”、“以我为核心”、“我是老造反”这个“我”字，搞臭风头主义、山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义。
    战斗在“三支”“ 两军”第一线的人民解放军各部队指战员，学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新教导，激动地说：最高统帅毛主席向无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众发出的新的战斗号召，也是给我们参加“三支”“两军”工作的指战员发出的新的战斗动员令。我们一定广泛、深入地宣传毛主席的这一战斗号召，广泛、深入地宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，为促进无产阶级革命派实现和加强革命大联合，进一步开展革命大批判，作出新的贡献。在上海第三钢铁厂支左的某部毛泽东思想宣传队，在促进这个厂实现革命大联合中作出了贡献。他们进厂以后，同厂里十个革命群众组织的负责人和革命群众一起，经常认真地、反复地学习“老三篇”和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，帮助无产阶级革命派和革命群众自觉地用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，大破头脑中的“私”字，提高阶级觉悟，实现了革命的大联合，全厂掀起了更加轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的革命大批判运动的新高潮。他们联系前一阶段工作实际，认真学习了《人民日报》社论，深有体会地说：千支援，万支援，宣传毛泽东思想是最大、最根本的支援。广大革命群众一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就会按照毛主席指明的航向，夺取一个又一个胜利。
