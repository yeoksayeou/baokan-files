Reporting Joy to Chairman Mao—The Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Has United!

We, the Red Guards, are overjoyed to report that the proletarian revolutionary factions have united! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a significant step forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we have overcome numerous obstacles and finally achieved this historic unity. This unity strengthens our revolutionary cause and ensures that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will triumph.

We pledge to continue fighting alongside Chairman Mao, following his teachings, and carrying out his revolutionary line. We will smash all counter-revolutionary elements and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proceeds smoothly. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
