From the revolutionary cradle of central Jichangping in Jinggangshan, traveling northwest for over a hundred li, one reaches the border of Ninggang, Yongxing, Lianhua, and Chaoling counties, the world-renowned Sanwan, nestled in a small valley surrounded by mountains. Forty years ago, it was here that our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the historic Sanwan reorganization, which had great significance. From here, under the great military thought of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people built an unparalleled new-type people's army.

Recently, we visited Sanwan. The villagers still often sing a folk song that has been passed down for forty years: “Sanwan brought down the Northern Dipper, illuminating the mountains and valleys; in 1927, Mao the commander came to Sanwan; Mao the commander came to Sanwan, bringing officers and soldiers; the red flag fluttered into Sanwan, and Sanwan became revolutionary.”

We first visited “Xieshenghe.” This is a small tiled house rebuilt to resemble the one from forty years ago. In 1927, on the fourth day of the ninth lunar month, Chairman Mao led the Hunan Autumn Harvest Uprising troops to Sanwan and stayed here. It was in this small tiled house that the great leader Chairman Mao formulated the plan for reorganizing the Red Army and began the creation of a new-type people's army.

The old Red Guards told us that the “Zhongjia Temple,” adjacent to the small room where Chairman Mao stayed, was the location of the regiment headquarters at that time. At that time, due to the complex composition and chaotic thoughts of the troops participating in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, Chairman Mao, after gathering the troops in Wenjiashi and arriving in Sanwan, resolutely carried out a rectification, reducing a division to a regiment—the First Regiment of the First Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. After the reorganization, the troops' consciousness was raised, the organization was streamlined, and combat effectiveness was greatly enhanced.

During the Sanwan reorganization, Chairman Mao proposed the brilliant idea of building the army politically and strengthening the political thought work of the army, issuing the great call to strengthen the party's construction in the army, “establishing party branches at the company level.” From then on, all levels of the army had party organizations, with squads in each platoon, party branches in each company, and party committees at the battalion level and above; from then on, all levels of the army established the system of party representatives, and the party's front committee was established, with Chairman Mao personally serving as the secretary. It was from this time that our army, under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China, which takes Mao Zedong Thought as its guide, determined the absolute leadership of the party over the army, and laid the organizational foundation for a new-type revolutionary army.

A newly built tiled house to the east of the village is the former site of the “Taihexiang” small grocery store, which was the location of the Red Army officers' meeting at that time and also the location of the soldiers' committee. Here, Chairman Mao brilliantly solved the issue of the officer-soldier relationship in the new-type people's army, teaching the cadres and soldiers that our army fights not just with weapons and technology, but mainly with politics, with people's consciousness and revolutionary spirit, with unity between officers and soldiers, and with unity between superiors and subordinates. Under Chairman Mao's personal guidance and leadership, soldiers' committees were established in the companies, implementing political equality between officers and soldiers, equal treatment between officers and soldiers, and a new-type officer-soldier relationship of mutual care, mutual help, mutual learning, and mutual encouragement, laying the foundation for the later three great democracies of politics, military, and economy under leadership.

During the Sanwan reorganization, Chairman Mao not only emphasized unity between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates within the army, but also emphasized unity between the army and the people. The old Red Guards told us that in Sanwan, Chairman Mao often went deep into the masses, took the lead in doing mass work, and established close army-people relations. Under Chairman Mao's guidance, cadres and soldiers actively carried out mass work. Some visited the homes of the locals, inquiring about their well-being and explaining that our army is the army of the poor, the proletarian army. Some visited every household, explaining revolutionary principles, inspiring them to overthrow the tyrants and distribute the land, and revolt, and provided relief to the helpless and impoverished farmers. The people of Sanwan recognized that Chairman Mao is the great savior of the poor people of the world, and the Red Army is truly their own children's army, and immediately bravely stood up to revolt with the Red Army. The army and the people quickly established a close and inseparable combat friendship.

Under the guidance of the old Red Guards, we came to the “Fengshuping” to the east of the village. Beside the platform stand two large maple trees and a large camphor tree, with thick trunks and tall branches, lush with leaves. The people of Sanwan wrote on the trees: “Big maple tree, big camphor tree, Chairman Mao gave a speech to the troops under these trees forty years ago.” The old Red Guards told us that forty years ago, on the eighth day of the ninth lunar month in the morning, as the sun just rose, the reorganized Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, carrying red flags, gathered neatly under the big trees in “Fengshuping” to listen to Chairman Mao's political mobilization report for the march to Jinggangshan. Subsequently, the great commander Chairman Mao led this new-type people's army, marching proudly and confidently up Jinggangshan, establishing China's first rural revolutionary base, and opening up the only correct path for the development of the Chinese revolution.

From then on, this unparalleled new-type people's army has grown and prospered under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, defeating powerful domestic and foreign enemies, and has made great contributions to the Chinese people and the people of the world. It has become a great wall for our country to defend against imperialist aggression and safeguard our national defense security, and the strongest support for all oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

　　新型人民军队的伟大开端
　　——三湾访问记
    从革命摇篮井冈山中心的茨坪，向西北走百余里，就是宁冈、永新、莲花、茶陵四县交界的九陇山，举世闻名的三湾，就座落在这丛山环抱的一个小山凹里。四十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的具有伟大历史意义的三湾改编，就是在这里进行的。从这里开始，中国人民在毛主席伟大的军事思想指引下，建设了一支举世无双的新型人民军队。
    最近，我们访问了三湾。山村的人民依然常常唱起四十年前在这里流传的一首歌谣：“三湾降了北斗星，满山遍野通通明；一九二七那一年，三湾来了毛司令；三湾来了毛司令，带来将官带来兵；红旗飘飘进三湾，九雄三湾闹革命。”
    我们首先参观了“协盛和”。这是按四十年前的模样修建起来的一所小瓦房。一九二七年农历九月初四，毛主席带领湖南秋收起义部队，来到三湾，就住在这里。伟大领袖毛主席就是在这所小瓦房里，制订改编红军的计划，着手创建新型人民军队的。
    当年的老赤卫队员告诉我们，和毛主席住过的这间小房子紧邻的“钟家祠”，就是当时改编部队的团部所在地。当时，由于参加秋收起义的部队的成份比较复杂，思想比较混乱，毛主席在文家市集合部队到达三湾后，便毅然决然进行整顿，将一个师缩编成一个团——中国工农革命军第一师第一团。整编后，部队的觉悟提高了，机构精简了，战斗力大大地提高了。
    在三湾改编中，毛主席提出了从政治上建军、加强军队政治思想工作的光辉思想，发出了在部队加强党的建设，“支部建在连上”的伟大号召。从此，全军各级都有了党的组织，班有小组，连有支部，营以上建立党委；从此，全军各级都建立了党代表制度，并且成立了党的前敌委员会，毛主席亲自担任书记。也就是从这时开始，我军在以毛泽东思想为指南的中国共产党的绝对领导之下，确定了党对军队的绝对领导，从组织上奠定了新型的革命军队的基础。
    村东一栋崭新的瓦房是“太和祥”小杂货铺的旧址，是当年红军军官会议的所在地，也是士兵委员会的所在地。在这里，毛主席天才地解决了新型人民军队的官兵关系，教导干部和战士，我军打仗决不是单靠武器和技术，而主要是靠政治，靠人的觉悟和革命精神，靠官兵一致，靠上下一致。在毛主席亲自教导和领导下，连队成立了士兵委员会，实行政治上官兵平等，待遇上官兵一致，官兵之间出现了互相爱护，互相帮助，互相学习，互相鼓励的新型的官兵关系，为后来的有领导的政治、军事、经济三大民主奠定了基础。
    在三湾改编时，毛主席不仅强调军内要官兵一致，上下一致，在军民关系上，则强调军民一致。老赤卫队员告诉我们，毛主席在三湾，经常深入劳苦群众之中，带头做群众工作，建立密切的军民关系。在毛主席的教导下，干部战士纷纷展开了群众工作。有的到老乡家里，问寒问暖，说明我军是穷人的队伍，无产阶级的军队。有的挨家逐户登门拜访，讲革命道理，启发他们打土豪分田地，闹革命，并对无依无靠、生活困难的农民进行了救济。三湾的群众认识到毛主席是天下穷人的大救星，红军真正是自己的子弟兵，立即勇敢地起来跟着红军闹革命。军民迅速建立起了生死与共、亲如鱼水的战斗友谊。
    我们在老赤卫队员的带领下，又来到村东的“枫树坪”。坪旁长着两棵大枫树和一棵大樟树，树粗数围，树高几丈，枝叶繁茂。三湾人民在大树上写道：“大枫树、大樟树，当年毛主席就在树底下向部队讲话。”老赤卫队员告诉我们，四十年前的农历九月初八日早晨，太阳刚刚出山，改编好的工农红军就打着红旗，整整齐齐地集合在这“枫树坪”的大树下听毛主席的向井冈山进军的政治动员报告。随后，伟大统帅毛主席，便率领这支新型的人民军队，雄赳赳气昂昂地上了井冈山，创建了中国农村第一个革命根据地，开辟了中国革命胜利发展的唯一正确的前进道路。
    从此，这支举世无双的新型人民军队，就一直在光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大，战胜了国内外强大敌人，为中国人民和世界人民立下了赫赫战功，成为我国防御帝国主义侵略、保卫我国国防安全的伟大的长城，成为全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的最强大的后盾。
