In the midst of the nationwide victory march of the proletarian cultural revolution army, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, another thrilling report has come from the front lines of the East China Sea defense. On September 8, our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force shot down one U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft belonging to the U.S.-made Kuomintang bandits.

This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a splendid achievement of the People's Liberation Army in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote preparedness," and a heavy blow to the conspiracies and sabotage activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Kuomintang bandits. This achievement is our great People's Liberation Army's tribute to the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great commander, Chairman Mao.

We joyfully celebrate this brilliant victory and extend our warmest congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the Air Force who participated in this battle!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must never relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory. Anyone who relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position."

The proletarian cultural revolution in our country has sounded the death knell for the class enemies at home and abroad, and their doom is even closer. However, the enemy is not willing to perish and will make desperate struggles. Now, U.S. imperialism, together with its accomplice, the Soviet revisionist clique, is escalating the war in Vietnam to force a "peace" and expand the invasion of Vietnam. At the same time, they are constantly provoking wars against our country. In the face of the enemy's various conspiracies and sabotage activities, the revolutionary masses and the broad masses of revolutionary people must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, learn from the glorious example of the People's Liberation Army, severely punish all sabotage activities of the class enemies, and be ready at any time to annihilate the invading enemies.

The brilliant victory of our People's Liberation Army Air Force in shooting down the U.S.-made Kuomintang bandits' U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft once again proves that the great People's Liberation Army is an invincible hero army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the most reliable defender of the proletarian cultural revolution, and a great and solid Great Wall. The class enemies at home and abroad are terrified and hate this great wall to the core. They are trying every means to sabotage our People's Liberation Army and disrupt military-civilian relations, attempting to fish in troubled waters. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launch a more extensive and enthusiastic campaign to support the army and love the people, further strengthen and consolidate this great wall of the People's Liberation Army, and make all class enemies suffer a crushing defeat against this wall.

We are advancing victoriously on the course of the proletarian cultural revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao. Anyone who dares to obstruct the rolling wheels of the revolution will be like a grasshopper trying to stop a chariot, crushed to pieces. We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang bandits: if you dare to cause trouble and sabotage, we will definitely make sure you come to no good end and meet complete annihilation.

### 敌人胆敢来捣乱就叫它彻底灭亡

　　敌人胆敢来捣乱就叫它彻底灭亡
    在全国无产阶级文化革命大军，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，举行胜利大进军的战鼓声中，从华东海防前线又传来了振奋人心的捷报。九月八日，我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，击落美制蒋匪帮U—2型高空侦察机一架。
    这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是人民解放军响应毛主席“抓革命，促战备”伟大号召新建立的辉煌战功，是对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的阴谋破坏活动又一个沉重的打击。这一个战功，是我们伟大的人民解放军对我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义四十周年的献礼。
    我们纵情欢呼这一光辉的胜利，我们向参加这次战斗的解放军空军部队指战员致以最热烈的祝贺！
    毛主席教导我们：“决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了国内外阶级敌人的丧钟，他们的末日更加临近了。但是，敌人是不甘心灭亡的，他们要作垂死的挣扎。现在，美帝国主义伙同它的帮凶苏修集团，一面在越南搞战争“升级”，以炸迫“和”，扩大侵越战争；一面又不断对我国进行战争挑衅。面对敌人的各种阴谋破坏活动，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众必须保持高度的革命警惕性，学习中国人民解放军的光辉榜样，严惩阶级敌人的一切破坏活动，随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。
    我解放军空军部队击落美制蒋匪帮U—2型高空侦察机的光辉胜利，再一次证明了伟大的人民解放军是用毛泽东思想武装起来的举世无双的英雄军队，是无产阶级文化大革命最可靠的保卫者，是一个伟大的、坚固的长城。国内外阶级敌人对这个伟大的长城，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们千方百计地破坏我人民解放军，挑拨军民关系，妄图混水摸鱼。无产阶级革命派，广大革命群众，必须响应毛主席的伟大号召，更大规模地展开热烈的拥军爱民运动，进一步加强和巩固人民解放军这个伟大的长城，让一切阶级敌人在这个长城面前碰得头破血流。
    我们正在毛主席指引的无产阶级文化大革命的航道上胜利前进。谁如果妄图阻挡滚滚向前的革命车轮，只能是螳臂挡车，被轧得粉身碎骨。我们严正警告美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、蒋介石匪帮，你们如果胆敢来捣乱、破坏，我们就一定叫你们有来无回，彻底灭亡。
