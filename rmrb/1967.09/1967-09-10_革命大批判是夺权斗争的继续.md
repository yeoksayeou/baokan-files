At a crucial juncture in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" was published. Using great Mao Zedong Thought, he exposed and criticized, without mercy, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their head. The publication of this article is part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and has extremely important significance for the entire Party, the entire army, and the revolutionary masses of the whole country in deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their head. To bombard the headquarters is to bombard the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Only by directing the spearhead of struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road can we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle. If the spearhead of struggle is directed at the wrong target, mistakes will be made. Therefore, at whom the spearhead of struggle is directed is a matter of principle. The counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu wants to confuse our revolutionary direction from the "left" or the right and direct the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be particularly vigilant against individuals like Khrushchev who have personal ambitions and engage in intrigues, and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at various levels." We must bear in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and promptly expose the intrigues of counter-revolutionary two-faced characters. We must not allow them to use the anarchist ideas of certain people to direct the spearhead of struggle at the proletarian headquarters and the great People's Liberation Army. Recently, a very small number of people in our school, with ulterior motives, have appeared in the guise of the "left" to try to overthrow the revolutionary committee. They have also taken advantage of certain shortcomings and errors of the leftists to fish in troubled waters. The facts have made us deeply realize: revolutionary criticism is the continuation of the struggle for power. The revolutionary masses must grasp and use power well; they must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, study and apply Chairman Mao's works conscientiously, and carry out revolutionary criticism thoroughly; otherwise, the political power seized by the proletariat may be lost again.

Revolutionary criticism is the most important political task at present, the most important principle, and the touchstone for testing everyone. All the revolutionary masses in our school are determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, pay great attention to the general direction of the struggle, pay great attention to safeguarding the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, pay great attention to carrying out the unified battle deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, pay great attention to grasping policies and strategies, pay great attention to uniting the majority, and pay great attention to preventing characters like Tao Zhu from confusing our ranks from the right or the "left" or from both sides at the same time. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, criticize and expose thoroughly the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their head. In the course of revolutionary criticism, we must develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolutionaries and the "three-in-one combination," consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve a thorough victory in the cultural revolution.

　　革命大批判是夺权斗争的继续

    在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，姚文元同志的《评陶铸的两本书》发表了。他用伟大的毛泽东思想，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，进行了无情的揭露和深刻的批判。这篇文章的发表，是毛主席伟大战略部署的组成部分，对全党全军全国无产阶级革命派深入开展革命的大批判有着极为重要的意义。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是要革以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命。炮打司令部，就是炮打以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。我们只有把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。如果把斗争的矛头指错了，就会犯错误。所以斗争的矛头指向谁，是大是大非问题。反革命两面派陶铸，就是妄想从“左”的方面或右的方面扰乱我们革命的大方向，把矛头指向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    毛主席教导我们说：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”我们必须牢记毛主席的教导，提高革命的警惕性，及时地识破反革命两面派的阴谋，决不能让他们利用某些人的无政府主义思潮，把斗争的矛头指向无产阶级司令部，指向伟大的人民解放军。最近，我校极少数别有用心的人，就是以“左”的面貌出现，企图搞垮革命委员会。他们还利用左派的某些缺点错误，混水摸鱼。事实使我们深刻地认识到：革命的大批判是夺权斗争的继续，无产阶级革命派要掌好权、用好权，就必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展革命的大批判，不然无产阶级夺到手的政权还会丧失掉。
    革命的大批判，是当前最大的政治，最重要的原则，是检验一切人的试金石。我们全校无产阶级革命派，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，十分注意斗争的大方向，十分注意维护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，十分注意执行毛主席和党中央统一的作战部署，十分注意掌握政策和策略，十分注意团结大多数，十分注意不让陶铸式的人物从右的方面或“左”的方面或同时从两方面搅乱我们的阵线。要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，从政治上、思想上、理论上把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭。要在革命的大批判中，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固无产阶级专政，夺取文化革命的彻底胜利。
