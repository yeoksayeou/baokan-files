Title: The Old Counter-Revolutionary Who Abolishes Armed Struggle

New and old revisionists often use the tone of a hypocrite to discuss armed struggle. China's Khrushchev is no exception. In 1966, when a foreign guest mentioned to him "achieving independence through armed struggle and taking the socialist road," he shook his head and said, "This needs to be carefully considered." "Because conducting armed struggle involves sacrifices and cannot be done lightly."

According to China's Khrushchev's reasoning, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America should not engage in armed struggle; they should only "cultivate themselves" behind closed doors—"carefully consider"; or engage in "profitable" business—give up military power to "become officials." It seems that by doing so, they can avoid sacrifices and "gain a lot."

However, historical facts are just the opposite. The sacrifices caused by armed struggle are far fewer than the deaths caused by hunger, cold, and illness among the impoverished masses who labored for exploiters all their lives in the old society. The fact that millions of people die of hunger every year under the rule of the Indian National Congress is a good example. Lenin was right: under the capitalist system, "even in the most peaceful days, workers will inevitably suffer countless sacrifices."

It is clear that China's Khrushchev, under the pretext of avoiding sacrifices, abolishes armed struggle, which in essence is to make the people forever slaves, forever endure endless pain and sacrifices, and forever take the road of "losing the party, losing the country, and losing one's head." How malicious his intentions are!

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought tell us that the proletariat can only seize power through armed struggle; and armed struggle is a bloody political struggle. Although conducting armed struggle will involve sacrifices, this is the only correct path for the oppressed people to achieve thorough liberation and avoid greater sacrifices. If one is afraid of bloodshed and sacrifices, the oppressed people will never achieve thorough liberation and will inevitably suffer greater sacrifices. As Lenin said on the eve of the October Revolution, "Without a great and heroic mass struggle involving many sacrifices, there can be no socialist revolution." The October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution fully prove this truth. If there were armed struggles in the world that did not involve bloodshed, then the creation of world history would be too easy.

Anyone who thinks that armed struggle can be smooth sailing and that there is a guarantee of no sacrifices beforehand can engage in armed struggle, is not a revolutionary at all, but merely a "thoroughly rotten Kerensky-style hypocrite," as Lenin said, "no matter how he calls himself, no matter what title he uses to disguise himself."

The self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" China's Khrushchev, although he also talks about "armed struggle" verbally, is completely a hypocrite's disguise. In reality, he is a thorough counter-revolutionary who abolishes armed struggle.

    取消武装斗争的老反革命		尚天
    新老修正主义者们往往以伪善者的腔调去谈论武装斗争。中国的赫鲁晓夫也是如此。一九六六年，当一位外宾向他谈到“通过武装斗争取得独立，走社会主义道路”时，他摇着脑袋说：“这要好好考虑。”“因为进行武装斗争，要有牺牲，不能轻率进行。”
    照中国赫鲁晓夫的经学推理，亚、非、拉人民不应该去进行武装斗争，只应该去闭门“修养”——“好好考虑”；或者去做“划得来”的“赚钱”的买卖——放弃兵权“去做官”。似乎如此就可以避免牺牲，就可以“占大便宜”。
    但是，历史的事实却恰恰相反，武装斗争所引起的牺牲，比起在旧社会里千千万万终身为剥削者而劳动的贫苦大众，由于饥寒交迫和贫病缠身所引起的死亡要少得多。印度人民在国大党政府的统治下，每年饿死上千万人，就是一个很好的例证。列宁说得对：在资本主义制度下，“即使在最平静的日子里，也经常地而且不可避免地会使工人阶级遭到无数的牺牲”。
    很显然，中国的赫鲁晓夫借口避免牺牲，而取消武装斗争，说穿了就是要人民永远当奴隶，永远忍受无限的痛苦和牺牲，永远走亡党、亡国、亡头的道路。其用心何其毒也！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想告诉我们，无产阶级只有用武装斗争才能夺得政权；而武装斗争是流血的政治。虽然进行武装斗争会有牺牲，但这却是被压迫人民获得彻底解放，从而免除更大牺牲的唯一正确的道路。如果害怕流血，害怕牺牲，被压迫人民就不可能获得彻底解放，就一定要遭受更大的牺牲。正如列宁在十月革命的前夕所说的，“没有付出许多牺牲的艰巨的群众性的革命斗争，就不可能有社会主义革命。”十月革命和中国革命都充分证明了这一真理。如果世界上存在着在不流血的条件下进行的武装斗争，那么世界历史的创造就未免太容易了。
    谁如果认为只有武装斗争一帆风顺，而且事先得到不会遭受牺牲的保票，才可以进行武装斗争，那他就根本不是革命者，而只不过是象列宁所说的“坏透了的高尔察克式的伪善者，不管他怎样称呼自己，不管他用什么称号把自己掩饰起来”。
    自称“老革命”的中国赫鲁晓夫虽然口头上也讲几句“武装斗争”，但这完全是伪善者的外衣，实际上，他是一个地地道道的取消武装斗争的老反革命。
