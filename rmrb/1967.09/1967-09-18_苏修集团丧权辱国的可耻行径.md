The Soviet revisionist group has recently made another shameful deal with the Japanese monopoly capitalist group.

At the second meeting of the "Sino-Soviet Economic Joint Committee" held in Moscow, the two sides reached an agreement for the Japanese monopoly capitalist group to provide "aid" and "jointly develop" the resources of Siberia and the Soviet Far East, including oil, copper mines, forests, and the expansion of Far Eastern ports, among others. On September 6, the Japanese monopoly organization held a "Sino-Soviet Economic Committee" meeting in Tokyo, enthusiastically discussing the "development of Siberia" plan, and decided to send a "survey team" to the area for "survey" before the end of the month.

The so-called "development of Siberia" is a major step for the Soviet revisionist traitor group to collude with the Japanese monopoly capitalist group. Before this, the two sides had already made a series of deals in fisheries, aviation, and the development of natural gas on Sakhalin Island. From land to sea, from sky to underground, the Soviet revisionist group has opened the door wide for the Japanese monopoly capital to infiltrate the Soviet Union.

The so-called "aid" and "joint development" of imperialism have always been euphemisms for aggression and plunder, and are their usual methods of promoting colonialism. The Soviet revisionist group, which claims to be "socialist" and "communist," actually allows imperialist countries to carry out capital exports in their own country, plunder resources, and exploit cheap labor to extract high profits. This is a shocking betrayal of the great Soviet people and a great disgrace to the Soviet Union!

Japanese imperialism has long coveted the vast and resource-rich land of Siberia. The Soviet people will never forget that soon after the victory of the October Revolution, fourteen capitalist countries launched armed interventions against the newly born Soviet state. Japanese imperialism then sent troops to Siberia, and the Soviet people paid a bloody price to defend their homeland's Siberia. However, half a century later, the traitor group that usurped the power of the Soviet Union actually opened the door voluntarily and handed over the right to exploit Siberia's resources to the Japanese financial clique, making Japanese imperialism's long-standing dream of meddling in Siberia come true without any effort. The Soviet revisionist group's auction of Siberia's natural resources proves that they are a bunch of national traitors and sellouts.

In fact, everyone knows that today's Japanese monopoly capital is largely controlled by American monopoly capital. The large-scale infiltration of Japanese monopoly capital into the Soviet Union means that American monopoly capital will also infiltrate the Soviet Union. Therefore, the dirty deal between the Soviet Union and Japan on the Siberian issue is essentially a variant of the so-called "U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

Comrade Stalin once denounced the Trotskyites for hating the revolution so much that they were willing to "directly betray their own country." Today, the Soviet revisionist traitor group led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, in order to collude with Japanese militarism to carry out anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people activities, is willing to sell out the national interests of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet revisionists are carrying out a capitalist restoration at home, making the economy riddled with holes and facing numerous difficulties. In order to maintain the increasingly bankrupt economy, they even beg for "aid" from the monopoly capital of imperialist countries led by the United States, attempting to build "communism" by relying on foreign monopoly capital. This shameful act of inviting thieves in and surrendering national rights and humiliating the nation not only exposes the extreme degeneration of this small group of Soviet revisionist traitors and exposes their fake communist goods; it also fully shows that this group of traitors has reached a dead end.

Siberia is the sacred territory of the Soviet people, and Siberia's resources are the precious wealth of the Soviet people. The Soviet people will never forgive this group of traitors who are full of crimes. One day, the Soviet people will rise up and smash the reactionary rule of this group of traitors!

### 苏修集团丧权辱国的可耻行径

    苏修集团丧权辱国的可耻行径
    不久前，苏修领导集团同日本垄断资本集团又做了一笔可耻的交易。
    在莫斯科举行的“苏日经济联合委员会”第二次会议上，苏日双方达成协议，由日本垄断资本集团提供“援助”，“联合开发”西伯利亚和苏联远东地区的资源，包括石油、铜矿、森林，以及扩建远东港口等等。九月六日，日本垄断组织在东京召开了“日苏经济委员会”，兴致勃勃地讨论了“开发西伯利亚”的计划，并决定月底前派遣“考察团”去当地进行“考察”。
    所谓“开发西伯利亚”，是苏修叛徒集团加紧勾结日本垄断资本集团的一个重大步骤。在这之前，苏日已在渔业、航空、开发库页岛天然煤气等方面做成了一连串交易。从陆地到海洋，从天空到地下，苏修集团为日本垄断资本的渗入苏联，大开方便之门。
    帝国主义的所谓“援助”，所谓“联合开发”，从来都是侵略和掠夺的代名词，是它们推行殖民主义的惯用的手法。打着
  “社会主义”、“共产主义”招牌的苏修集团，竟然死气白赖地让帝国主义国家对本国实行资本输出，掠夺资源，利用廉价的劳动力榨取高额利润。这真是对伟大的苏联人民惊人的大叛卖，是苏联的奇耻大辱！
    日本帝国主义早就对西伯利亚这块幅员辽阔、资源丰富的土地垂涎三尺。苏联人民绝不会忘记，十月革命胜利之初，十四个资本主义国家对新生的苏维埃国家进行武装干涉。日本帝国主义当时出兵西伯利亚，苏维埃人民为了保卫祖国的西伯利亚而付出了鲜血的代价。但是，半个世纪以后，篡夺了苏联政权的叛徒集团竟然主动开放门户，拱手把西伯利亚资源的开采权交给日本财阀，使日本帝国主义多年来企图染指西伯利亚的梦想，不费吹灰之力就得以实现。苏修集团对西伯利亚自然资源的大拍卖，证明了他们是一伙民族败类和卖国贼。
    事实上，谁都知道，今天的日本垄断资本在很大程度上是受美国垄断资本控制的。日本垄断资本大举渗入苏联的结果，美国垄断资本也就随之渗入苏联。因此，苏日在西伯利亚问题上达成的肮脏交易，实质上也就是所谓“美苏合作”的变种。
    斯大林同志曾经斥责托洛茨基分子，由于敌视革命，不惜“直接背叛自己的祖国”。今天，以勃列日?夫和柯西金为首的苏修叛徒集团为了勾结日本军国主义进行反华反共反人民的勾当，不惜出卖苏联的国家权益。同时，苏修在国内大搞资本主义复辟，弄得经济上百孔千疮，困难重重。为了维持日益破产的经济，他们甚至向以美国为首的帝国主义国家的垄断资本乞求“援助”，企图依靠外国垄断资本来建设“共产主义”。这种开门揖盗、丧权辱国的可耻行径，不仅暴露了这一小撮苏修叛徒的极端堕落，暴露了他们的假共产主义的黑货；同时也充分说明了他们这伙叛徒已经走到了穷途末路。
    西伯利亚是苏联人民的神圣疆土，西伯利亚的资源是苏联人民的珍贵财富。苏联人民是绝对饶不过这伙罪恶累累的叛徒集团的。终有一天，苏联人民要起来砸碎这伙叛徒集团的反动统治！
