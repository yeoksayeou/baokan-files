Facing the morning sun, I feel exhilarated, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in my hands, my heart sings! Ah! So much blood surges to my heart, in my heart stands a lofty figure, he is the great leader Chairman Mao—the hope of the proletariat of the whole world. How fortunate! When I read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations. A few short lines cannot express my feelings for Chairman Mao! His lofty spirit makes people extremely excited! The Eastern sun illuminates the revolutionary path!

"Workers of the world, unite!" Forever hold high the red flag and march forward bravely! Apply the great thought of Mao Zedong! Thoroughly smash the shackles and strive for liberation! The proletariat of Asia, Africa, and Latin America unite as one, resolutely smash all unreasonable systems, stand up bravely, and dare to make revolution! Chairman Mao's intentions are the intentions of billions of people! We are on the front lines fighting the Americans, conducting revolutionary struggles, determined to annihilate the American invaders. From the Friendship Pass to the Golden Horn, our motherland is one whole. If the invaders plot to divide her, our people will resolutely fight a protracted war! Remember the words of Chairman Hu! A few pages of paper cannot express the lofty friendship! Cheers for the great Communist Party of China! Cheers for the glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!
