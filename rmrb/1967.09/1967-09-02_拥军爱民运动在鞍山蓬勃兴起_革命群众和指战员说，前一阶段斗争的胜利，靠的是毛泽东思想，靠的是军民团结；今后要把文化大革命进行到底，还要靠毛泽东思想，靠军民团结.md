A mass movement to support the army and love the people is sweeping across Anshan, the steel city of the motherland. The revolutionary masses and soldiers have been passionately discussing the great significance of supporting the army and loving the people. They say: Chairman Mao's call to support the army and love the people has extremely important historical and contemporary significance. It is the signal to advance and the order to mobilize for accelerating the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They unanimously declared that they will hold high the great banner of supporting the army and loving the people, set an example in supporting the army and loving the people, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of soldiers stationed in Anshan have been closely watching the developments since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in the steel city. At the critical moment when the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Anshan City and Anshan Steel Works were persecuting the "Anshan Steel Works Guarding Mao Zedong Thought Battle Headquarters," they resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses. They stood up and firmly supported this strong revolutionary organization, joining it and other revolutionary organizations to fight shoulder to shoulder, exposing the class struggle in Anshan City and Anshan Steel Works, and putting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anshan on the correct track as guided by Chairman Mao.

In the new high tide of supporting the army and loving the people, the revolutionary masses of Anshan, who have forged deep battle friendships with the stationed troops, are enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some recalled how, at the most difficult times, the PLA stood up and firmly supported the revolutionary masses, protected them, and fought side by side with them in eating, living, and studying together. Others introduced how, during smooth times of struggle, the PLA educated them to heighten their vigilance, strengthen their fighting spirit, and learn together Chairman Mao's teaching that "whoever only sees the bright side and not the difficult side will not be able to fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks." In this high tide of supporting the army and loving the people, the revolutionary masses all deeply felt that Chairman Mao's teaching that "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people" is a great truth. Without the great support of the People's Liberation Army for the revolutionary masses of Anshan, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anshan would not have such a good situation.

In the thriving movement of supporting the army and loving the people, the broad masses of soldiers also enthusiastically praised the support and care of the revolutionary masses for the troops. They said: Without the support of the revolutionary masses, we could not well accomplish the "three supports and two militaries" tasks, and we could not guarantee the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the days of supporting the army and loving the people, whenever the revolutionary masses and soldiers talk about the current good situation in Anshan, they all say: The victories achieved in the previous stage of struggle rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and on the unity between the army and the people; to carry the Cultural Revolution in Anshan to the end, we still need Mao Zedong Thought and the unity between the army and the people. They unanimously declared that they will inspire and learn from each other, unite more closely, and fight together against the enemy.

Today, the revolutionary masses of Anshan held a grand meeting, determined to hold high the great banner of supporting the army and loving the people, and carry out the movement more extensively and deeply. The responsible person of the "Anshan Steel Works Guarding Mao Zedong Thought Battle Headquarters" and the representative of the PLA firmly declared at the meeting that they will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the high tide of revolutionary criticism and in the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, they will be more closely united and fight shoulder to shoulder to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and strive to build Anshan into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

　　拥军爱民运动在鞍山蓬勃兴起
    革命群众和指战员说，前一阶段斗争的胜利，靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是军民团结；今后要把文化大革命进行到底，还要靠毛泽东思想，靠军民团结
    新华社鞍山一日电 在祖国钢城——鞍山，一个群众性的拥军爱民运动正在广泛地开展起来。坚决捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的鞍山驻军和“鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部”等革命组织的无产阶级革命派，连日来满怀革命的深情，畅谈拥军爱民的伟大意义。他们说：毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，具有非常重大的历史意义和现实意义，它是加速无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的进军号、动员令。他们一致表示，要把“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜举得高高的，作拥军爱民的模范，在无产阶级文化大革命中再立新功。
    鞍山驻军的广大指战员，从无产阶级文化大革命在钢都兴起以后，就密切注视着形势的发展。就在鞍山市和鞍钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派迫害“鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部”的关键时刻，他们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，挺身而出，坚决支持这个坚强的革命组织，同它和其他革命组织一起，并肩战斗，揭开了鞍山市和鞍钢阶级斗争的盖子，使鞍山的无产阶级文化大革命走上了毛主席指引的正确轨道。
    在拥军爱民的新高潮中，和驻军结下了深厚战斗友谊的鞍山无产阶级革命派，怀着革命的激情，热烈歌颂人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中的丰功伟绩。他们有的回顾了在他们处境最困难的时候，解放军挺身而出，坚决支持革命派，保护革命派，和革命派同吃同住同学习、并肩战斗时的情形；有的介绍了在斗争顺利的时候，解放军又怎样教育他们提高警惕，加强斗志，和他们一起学习毛主席“谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争”的教导的情况。在这拥军爱民的高潮中，革命群众都深有体会地说，毛主席的教导“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，是伟大的真理。没有伟大的人民解放军对鞍山无产阶级革命派的支持，鞍山的无产阶级文化大革命就不会有这样的大好形势。
    在蓬勃兴起的拥军爱民运动中，广大指战员也以激动的心情，赞扬了革命群众对部队的支援和爱护。他们说：没有无产阶级革命派的支持，就不能很好地完成“三支”“两军”任务，就不能保证无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。
    在军爱民、民拥军的日子里，革命群众和指战员们每当谈到今天鞍山的大好形势，都说：前一阶段斗争取得的胜利，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是军民团结；今后要把鞍山文化大革命进行到底，还要靠毛泽东思想，靠军民团结。他们一致表示，要互相鼓舞，互相学习，更好地团结一致，共同对敌。
    今天，鞍山无产阶级革命派隆重集会，决心更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，把拥军爱民运动更广泛更深入地开展起来。“鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部”负责人和解放军代表，在会上坚定地表示，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，在革命大批判的高潮中，在拥军爱民的运动中，更加亲密团结，并肩战斗，为彻底摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，为把鞍山建设成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
