In the palm groves, pursuing the enemy to the end; by the Mekong River, triumphant songs of victory. The military and civilians of My Tho Province in South Vietnam annihilated more than a thousand American troops in three days.

According to New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 25th. Just as the military and civilians in many places in South Vietnam are continuously winning battles, the military and civilians in My Tho Province in the Mekong Delta have recently inflicted a heavy defeat on the enemy, annihilating more than a thousand American invaders in three days.

According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of My Tho Province, on the 13th, 15th, and 16th, bravely smashed a large-scale "sweeping operation" launched by 15,000 American and puppet troops in the area south of Highway 4 and on the Ba Lai River. At the same time, they attacked the American military base on the outskirts of My Tho City, annihilating more than a thousand American invaders, sinking or damaging 26 American naval vessels, shooting down 8 American planes, and destroying or damaging 16 armored vehicles.

The victory of the military and civilians of My Tho Province has once again exposed the shameful failure of the American bandits' boasted "helicopter tactics," "armored vehicle tactics," and "naval tactics."

The report said that on the morning of September 13th, four battalions of the American 9th Infantry Division, under the cover of a large number of planes, cannons, armored vehicles, and warships, advanced in three columns towards several villages in the Cai Lay District of My Tho Province south of Highway 4. The local liberation armed forces, with high vigilance, had long been ready for battle. As soon as the enemy fell into the ambush, the liberation armed forces immediately launched a fierce attack from all sides, annihilating more than 270 American bandits and destroying 5 armored vehicles, damaging many more.

On the 15th, the American bandits again sent eight battalions of American and puppet troops to "sweep" through the villages of My Tho, My Xuan, and Long Thanh in Cai Lay District. As soon as the enemy's fleet entered the Ba Lai River from the Mekong River and had not yet landed, the liberation armed forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack, sinking 16 of their ships and damaging 10, causing more than 400 American invaders on board to suffer casualties. Nine of the armored vehicles on the ships were hit and set on fire.

Other American troops who managed to land also suffered heavy losses from the attacks by the liberation army and guerrilla forces, with 150 killed or wounded. The liberation armed forces also shot down 7 helicopters and one F-105 jet fighter. That night, the liberation armed forces, riding on the momentum of victory, launched a fierce artillery attack on the American base in Phuoc Tho Village, Chau Thanh District, annihilating more than 200 enemy troops.

　　椰林丛中征穷寇　湄公河畔奏凯歌
　　南越美萩省军民三天歼美军一千多
    据新华社河内二十五日电　正当南越许多地方的军民接连不断地打胜仗的时候，战斗在南越湄公河三角洲的美萩省军民最近又痛歼敌人，三天内共消灭美国侵略军一千多名。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美萩省军民十三日、十五日和十六日，在第四号公路南面地区和巴莱河上，英勇地粉碎了由一万五千名美伪军发动的一次陆海空联合大“扫荡”，同时袭击了美萩市郊的美军基地，消灭美国侵略军一千多名，击沉击伤美国海军船只二十六艘，击落美机八架，击毁击伤装甲车十六辆。
    美萩省军民这次胜利，使美国强盗吹嘘的“直升飞机战术”，“装甲车战术”，“海军战术”又一次遭到可耻破产。
    报道说，九月十三日上午，美国第九步兵师四个营的敌人，在大批飞机、大炮、装甲车和战船的掩护下，分成三路，向第四号公路南面的美萩省丐礼县的一些乡进犯。具有高度警惕性的当地解放武装力量早已严阵以待。当敌人陷入埋伏阵地以后，解放武装力量立即从四面八方向敌人进行猛烈射击，一举消灭美国强盗二百七十多名，击毁装甲车五辆，击伤多辆。
    十五日，美国强盗又出动八个营美伪军，向丐礼县绵山乡、春山乡和隆忠乡发动“扫荡”。当敌人的船队从湄公河进入巴莱河还来不及登陆的时候，解放武装力量就立即给以迎头痛击，当场击沉其中的十六艘，击伤十艘，使船上的四百多名美国侵略军遭到伤亡，船上载运的装甲车有九辆被击中起火燃烧。
    另一些侥幸登陆的美军，也遭到解放军和游击队的痛击，被打死打伤一百五十名。解放武装力量还击落直升飞机七架和F—105型喷气式战斗机一架。当天夜间，解放武装力量乘胜前进，又猛烈炮击周城县平德乡美军基地，消灭敌人二百多名。
