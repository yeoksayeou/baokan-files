In triumphant songs, we welcome our comrades
— Welcoming the Tirana, Albania “One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun” Amateur Art Troupe
Navy Political Work Troupe, Military Band “Red Rebel Fleet”

With the East Wind blowing strongly and good news arriving frequently, at a time when the people of our country are resolutely implementing the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity, and joyfully celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we welcome with immense joy the artistic envoys of the Albanian people from the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism—the Tirana, Albania “One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun” Amateur Art Troupe visiting our country for performances!

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered the decisive battle stage of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. Revolutionary masses, following the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, are achieving great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought in the great criticism, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and concentrating forces to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have fallen into the vast sea of people's war. The Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted the socialist construction in our country. Revolutionary masses are implementing Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," causing our country's industrial and agricultural production to rise to new heights. Under this excellent situation, we welcome the arrival of our heroic Albanian comrades with revolutionary enthusiasm!

We are very happy to see that under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party headed by the great communist fighter Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have further carried out proletarian democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the mass revolutionary movement, promoted the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses, and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is an important contribution to the development of the socialist revolution and the prevention of capitalist restoration.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “Heroic people's Albania has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe.” We are very happy to see that under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have smashed the imperialist and modern revisionist blockade, sabotage, and plots to overthrow the People's Republic of Albania. Your great achievements in the class struggle at home and abroad and in the cause of socialist construction have made this beacon of socialism even more brilliant.

As cultural workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we are also very happy to see that Comrade Hoxha's call at the Fifth Party Congress for literature and art to become a powerful weapon for the Party to educate workers with socialist and communist spirit has been warmly supported and actively responded to by professional and amateur artists throughout Albania, launching a high tide of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with art. You, professional and amateur artists, have rushed to factories, rural areas, and units, combined with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, performed and created while working, making Albanian socialist art present a prosperous scene. Dear comrades, your great achievements have greatly inspired us. You have brought the latest and richest fruits of the Albanian ideological and cultural revolution, and we will definitely learn well from you.

The two parties and peoples of China and Albania have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship in the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and in the struggle for the cause of socialism and communism. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “'The world is wide, but there are friends; distant as the horizon, but we are neighbors.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected.” Comrade Hoxha pointed out that our two parties and peoples will always “stand shoulder to shoulder” on the common revolutionary road, whether in peaceful times or in stormy moments. In the years to come, the great friendship between our two parties and peoples will be further consolidated and developed, shining with even more brilliant light.

We wish our dear comrades to raise the banner of ideological and cultural revolution higher and achieve success in their performances in our country!

　　凯歌声中迎亲人
　　——欢迎阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团
　　海政文工团、军乐队“红色造反舰队”
    东风劲吹，喜讯频传。在我国人民以实际行动坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，掀起革命大批判和革命大联合新高潮的时候，在我国人民欢欣鼓舞迎接中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，我们以万分喜悦的心情，热烈欢迎来自反帝反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚人民的艺术使者——阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团来我国访问演出！
    目前我国无产阶级文化大革命已经进入到彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的决战阶段。广大革命群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，在革命的大批判中，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现大联合，促进革命的三结合，集中力量进行斗批改。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海中。文化大革命有力地推动了我国社会主义建设。广大革命群众执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的战略方针，使我国工农业生产出现了新的高涨。在一片大好形势下，我们满怀革命豪情，欢迎英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友的到来！
    我们十分高兴地看到，在以伟大的共产主义战士恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民在群众性的革命化运动中，进一步发扬了无产阶级专政下的大民主，促进了广大人民的思想革命化，巩固了无产阶级专政。这对于发展社会主义革命和防止资本主义复辟是重要的贡献。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”我们十分高兴地看到，阿尔巴尼亚人民在恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义的封锁、破坏和企图颠覆阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的阴谋。你们在国内外阶级斗争中和社会主义建设事业中取得的伟大成就，使这盏社会主义的明灯更加光辉灿烂了。
    作为中国人民解放军的文艺工作者，我们也十分高兴地看到：霍查同志在党的第五次代表大会上所发出的文学和艺术必须成为党以社会主义和共产主义精神教育劳动者的有力武器的号召，已经得到阿尔巴尼亚全国专业和业余文艺工作者的热烈拥护和积极响应，在全国掀起了一个文艺为工农兵服务的高潮。你们专业和业余文艺工作者纷纷奔向工厂、农村和连队，和广大的工农兵结合，边演出，边创作，使阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义文艺呈现出一派繁荣景象。亲爱的战友们，你们的伟大成就极大地鼓舞了我们。你们带来了阿尔巴尼亚思想文化革命最新的丰硕成果，我们一定很好地向你们学习。
    中阿两党、两国人民，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争中，在为社会主义和共产主义事业的斗争中，结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”霍查同志指出，我们两党、两国人民“在共同的革命道路上前进，无论在和平的日子里，还是在暴风雨的时刻”，都将永远“肩并肩地站在一起”。在今后的岁月里，我们两党、两国人民之间的伟大友谊，必将获得进一步的巩固和发展，放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
    预祝亲爱的战友们更高地举起思想文化革命的大旗，在我国演出成功！
