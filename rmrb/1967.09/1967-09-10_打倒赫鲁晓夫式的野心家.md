The important article "Criticizing Tao Zhu's Two Books" by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, published at this crucial juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is an important component of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It is the important policy currently guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and another great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The publication of this important article is a major battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. It is like an atomic bomb, striking the heart of the bourgeois headquarters and delivering another fatal blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be particularly vigilant against personal ambitionists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at various levels." The Chinese Khrushchev is such an ambitious plotter, and so is Tao Zhu. Exposing their ugly faces completely in broad daylight greatly helps us to identify Khrushchev-like figures. Such ambitious plotters as Tao Zhu always play all kinds of tricks to achieve their evil goals of usurping the Party, usurping the government, and usurping the military. They use two counter-revolutionary tactics alternately as the class struggle situation changes, sometimes from the right and sometimes from the "left," launching frenzied attacks on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary comrades must heighten their vigilance, open their eyes wide, and wield the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize and denounce this handful of elements, making sure they never rise again.

At this crucial juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in this sharp and complex class struggle, we must be highly vigilant against a handful of class enemies who use the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to split the ranks of the revolutionary masses, confuse the class lines, and achieve their evil, unspoken goals. The revolutionary masses must see through their tricks and launch a counterattack.

The left makes mistakes, and the right takes advantage of them—this has always been the case. To fundamentally eliminate this phenomenon, we must firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. Our current important task is to thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, such as Tao Zhu, who advocate "doubt everything, overthrow everything." We must thoroughly overcome the vacillation of petty-bourgeois ideology and overcome anti-proletarian factionalism, achieve great unity, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and deliver a heavy blow to that handful of ambitious plotters, conspirators, and two-faced individuals like Tao Zhu!

A new high tide of revolutionary criticism has risen, and a new battle has begun. Comrades of the revolutionary masses on all fronts, act quickly! More firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, march in step, unite in will, and under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite all forces that can be united, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and to fight for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 打倒赫鲁晓夫式的野心家

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

　　打倒赫鲁晓夫式的野心家
    姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》，在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头发表，这是毛主席伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分，是毛主席和党中央目前指导无产阶级文化大革命的重要方针，是毛主席革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    这篇重要文章的发表，是彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的重要一战。它象一颗原子弹，击中了资产阶级司令部的心脏，给党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又一致命的打击。
    毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”中国赫鲁晓夫是这样的野心家，陶铸也是这样的野心家。把他们的丑恶嘴脸彻底暴露在光天化日之下，大大有助于我们去识别赫鲁晓夫式的人物。陶铸这样的野心家，总是要玩弄种种阴谋，以便达到篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶目的。他们随着阶级斗争形势的变化，交替使用反革命的两手，时而从右的方面，时而又从“左”的方面，疯狂地向毛主席的革命路线进攻。革命的同志必须提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，把这一小撮彻底批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    当前，在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，在这样尖锐复杂的阶级大搏斗中，我们必须高度警惕一小撮阶级敌人，利用我们队伍中的小资产阶级思潮，分裂无产阶级革命派队伍，搅乱阶级阵线，达到其不可告人的罪恶目的。无产阶级革命派要识破他们的阴谋，展开针锋相对的斗争。
    左派犯错误，右派利用，历来如此。为了从根本上杜绝这种现象，我们要坚决遵循毛主席的教导，必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。当前，我们的重要任务，就是要在我们队伍中彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派陶铸之流所散布的“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的毒素，彻底克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，克服反无产阶级的派性，实现革命大联合，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，给那一小撮陶铸式的野心家、阴谋家、两面派，以沉重的打击！
    革命大批判的新高潮兴起来了，新的战役打响了。各条战线上的无产阶级革命派的战友们，火速行动起来，更坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，整齐步伐，统一意志，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，团结一切可以团结的力量，为彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而战斗吧！（《文汇报》九月八日社论）
