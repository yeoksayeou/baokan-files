Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" politically, ideologically, and theoretically exposes and deeply criticizes the most reactionary clique within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, who are taking the capitalist road.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article actively applies Mao Zedong Thought, using a bold, vivid, and powerful pen to depict the true face of the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu. Tao Zhu is a key figure in the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev. After the historic Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Tao Zhu stubbornly persisted in the bourgeois reactionary line. Tao Zhu sometimes appeared extremely right-wing and sometimes pretended to be extremely "left-wing." Criticizing Tao Zhu, criticizing this loyal follower of China's Khrushchev, is a great impetus for the current focus on concentrating firepower and targets to carry out a good revolutionary criticism. This is an important deployment for thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev.

The most crucial aspect of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. The focus of the struggle is directed at whom, which is a principle issue of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a matter of right and wrong. If the focus of the struggle is correct, we can achieve one victory after another. If the focus of the struggle is wrong, we will go astray.

The current revolutionary situation is better than ever because, in the first year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses' struggle focus was always directed at the Party's largest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road, causing their counter-revolutionary line to collapse completely in the face of the awakening of the masses. The current strategic task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to persistently grasp the direction of the struggle, to further carry out the great criticism, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units, and in the process of the great criticism, to develop and consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to achieve decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the stench of China's largest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road, to make them stink more than Trotsky did and more than Khrushchev does now, to make them stink for eternity and never be able to turn over a new leaf, this is the great historical task of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres.

The great criticism is the greatest politics at present.

The great criticism is the most important principle at present.

The great criticism is the touchstone for testing everyone.

Are you a revolutionary of the proletariat? Then you must necessarily be concerned with the greatest politics, be responsible to the proletariat, be responsible for the future of the motherland, be responsible for the world revolution, and unshakably carry the great criticism to the end.

Are you a small-bourgeois revolutionary? Then you will waver, run east when the wind blows from the east and run west when the wind blows from the west, be swayed by the factionalism of small groups, and neglect the greatest politics of the great criticism, deviating from the direction of the struggle.

At present, we must especially be on guard against tendencies that disrupt the direction of the struggle from the "extreme left" and from the right.

The continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the deepening of class struggle force a small clique of class enemies to constantly change their tactics. Currently, one of their methods is to use certain anarchist tendencies and factionalism within the revolutionary ranks, appearing in the guise of being extremely "left" but actually extremely right, to sow discord, fish in troubled waters, and attempt to sabotage and split the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and to sabotage and split the great pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the People's Liberation Army. They do this to divert the direction of the revolutionary struggle, disrupt our class lines, and attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The recent "May 16" counter-revolutionary clique, which was exposed by the revolutionary masses and manipulated by a small clique of bad leaders, is such a counter-revolutionary group. All revolutionary comrades must fully heighten their revolutionary vigilance and never be careless.

We must guard against and be alert to disruptive activities from the right and the "extreme left." We must not allow the small clique of power-holders within the Party who have been overthrown and are taking the capitalist road, as well as the conservative forces insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, to strike back at and retaliate against the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Distinguish between the reactionaries and the revolutionaries, expose the reactionaries' plots, arouse the revolutionaries' alertness and attention, boost our morale, and demoralize the enemy. Only then can we isolate the reactionaries, defeat them, or replace them."

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary comrades! In the current great victory situation, let us closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, unite the majority of cadres and masses, pay attention to the Party's policies and strategies, and with a hundredfold fighting spirit, vigorously invest in the extremely magnificent cause of the great criticism!

### 掌握革命斗争的大方向  深入开展革命的大批判

　　掌握革命斗争的大方向
　　深入开展革命的大批判
    姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》一文，从政治上、思想上、理论上，无情地揭露和深刻地批判了党内以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    姚文元同志这篇文章，活学活用毛泽东思想，以泼辣、生动、有力的笔，刻画出了反革命两面派陶铸的鬼脸。陶铸，是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的重要头目。在具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会之后，陶铸继续顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线。陶铸时而显得极右，时而装作极“左”。批判陶铸，批判这个中国赫鲁晓夫的忠实追随者，对于当前集中火力，集中目标，搞好革命的大批判，是一个极大的推动。这是彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个重要部署。
    无产阶级文化大革命最重要的关键，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。斗争的锋芒对准什么人，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则问题，是大是大非问题。斗争的锋芒对了，就能够取得一个又一个的胜利。斗争的锋芒错了，就会走错路。
    当前革命形势之所以空前大好，主要是因为在无产阶级文化大革命的第一个年头，广大革命群众的斗争锋芒始终指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使他们的反革命阵线在群众觉醒的威力面前，全面崩溃了。当前无产阶级文化大革命的战略性任务，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持不懈地掌握斗争大方向，进一步搞好革命的大批判，搞好各单位的斗批改，并在革命的大批判中，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭中国最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，批得他们比当年的托洛茨基还臭，比眼前的赫鲁晓夫还臭，让他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身，这是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的伟大历史任务。
    革命的大批判，这是当前最大的政治。
    革命的大批判，这是当前最重要的原则。
    革命的大批判，这是检验一切人们的试金石。
    你是无产阶级革命派吗？你就必然关心最大的政治，对无产阶级负责，对祖国的前途负责，对世界革命负责，毫不动摇地将革命大批判进行到底。
    你是小资产阶级革命家吗？你就会摇摆不定，东刮一股风往东跑，西刮一股风往西跑，被小团体的派性所左右，把革命大批判这个最大的政治置之脑后，背离斗争的大方向。
    目前，我们要特别注意防止从极“左”的方面和从右的方面来搅乱斗争大方向的倾向。
    无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，阶级斗争的不断深入，迫使一小撮阶级敌人，经常改变他们的做法。目前，他们所使用的手段之一，就是利用革命队伍中的某些无政府主义思潮和小资产阶级的派性，以貌似极“左”实质极右的面目出现，挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，妄图破坏和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，妄图破坏和分裂伟大的中国人民解放军这个无产阶级专政的伟大支柱。他们这样做，就是为了转移革命斗争的大方向，搅乱我们的阶级阵线，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。最近被广大革命群众揭露出来的、被一小撮坏头头操纵的“五·一六”，就是这样的一个反革命小集团。一切革命同志，务必充分提高革命警惕性，万万不可粗心大意。
    我们要防止和警惕来自右的方面和极“左”的方面的破坏活动，我们绝不能允许党内已被打倒的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以及坚持资产阶级反动路线的保守势力，对无产阶级革命派进行打击报复，反攻倒算。
    毛主席教导我们：“划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之。”
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，革命的同志们！在当前大好的胜利形势下，让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，团结干部和群众的大多数，注意党的政策和策略，以百倍昂扬的斗志，精神抖擞地投入革命大批判的极其雄伟的事业中去吧！
