Chairman Mao said, “People’s communes are good.” This statement is absolutely true and resonates deeply with us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Over the past decade, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have progressed from mutual aid teams to primary cooperatives, then to advanced cooperatives, and now we have embarked on the path to communism through people’s communes. The socialist economy in rural areas has developed rapidly, our enthusiasm has grown stronger, and our lives have improved. However, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, seeing that we broad masses of peasants have taken the road to common prosperity under socialism, is furious and openly opposes it.

Taking advantage of our country’s temporary economic difficulties, he represents the interests of the landlord class and has come out to advocate the “three freedoms and one contract.” At that time, in our Heilonggong Brigade, a whirlwind of evil ideas blew through, such as “contract production to the team,” “distribute more land for private plots and engage in small-scale free enterprise,” “divide livestock for individual feeding and return them to households,” and so on. The fox is paying a New Year’s visit to the chicken—it has no good intentions. It aims to sabotage the collective economy and make us engage in small-scale reclamation, cultivate small plots of land, and take the capitalist road. Every small plot of land reclaimed means one more private interest, leading to community members and the collective having divided loyalties, with individuals and the collective competing for labor. At that time, some community members put all their effort into small-scale free enterprise. Most of the brigade’s land was only plowed once, resulting in weeds and crops growing together. By autumn, the yield per mu was only over eighty jin, not only contributing nothing to the state but also relying on state relief to get by.

It wasn’t just that. Our brigade also once sold collective oxen to individual community members for private breeding, developing individual economies and opening free markets. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party crazily promoted “contract production to households,” making us “match strong with strong, weak with weak,” and voluntarily form groups. They forcibly divided our brigade of over 200 households into 18 groups, excluding over 30 households of poor and lower-middle peasants, forcing them into individual farming and pushing them back into misery.

These facts are ironclad evidence of Liu Shaoqi’s attempt to restore capitalism. He wants us poor and lower-middle peasants to retrace our steps and suffer again; he also wants landlords and rich peasants to revive and exploit us poor and lower-middle peasants even more cruelly. Our personal experiences have made us see more clearly that the “three freedoms and one contract” advocated by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party is nothing but a poisoned arrow aimed at socialism; it is a big poisonous knife that cuts off the collective economy of the people’s communes; it is a corrosive agent that dissolves the collective consciousness of the community members. In a word: it aims to make socialism retreat and capitalism fully restored.

Chairman Mao said, “Apart from socialism, there is no other way out.” The glorious history and bright future of agricultural cooperatives make us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that only by following Chairman Mao and adhering to the socialist direction can we achieve complete liberation. We resolutely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao and advance through storms and waves, carrying the revolution through to the end.

　　“三自一包”就是复辟资本主义
　　尚志县黑龙宫公社黑龙宫大队党支部书记　何玉清
    毛主席说：“人民公社好”。这句话千真万确，正说在我们贫下中农心坎上。
    十几年来，我们在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，由互助组到初级社、高级社，又走上了通向共产主义的天桥——人民公社。农村的社会主义经济迅速发展，我们的干劲越来越足，日子越过越好。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，看到我们广大农民走上共同富裕的社会主义道路，恨得要命，公然反对。
    他乘我们国家经济发生暂时困难的时候，代表地主阶级的利益，跳了出来，抛出了“三自一包”的黑货。当时，在我们黑龙宫大队也刮起了一阵妖风，什么
  “包产到组”，“多分多留自留地、大搞小自由”，“牲畜分槽饲养，下放到户”等等鬼点子都出来了。黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心，就是要搞垮集体经济，让我们大搞小开荒，多种小块地，走资本主义道路。搞一块小开荒，就多一份私心，弄得社员和集体分心眼，个人、集体争劳力。当时有些社员把劲都用到小自由上去了。队里的地大部分只铲趟一遍，结果草苗一齐长，到秋亩产才八十多斤，不但对国家没贡献，还得靠着国家救济过日子。
    不光是这样，我们大队还曾把集体耕牛卖给社员个人饲养，发展个体经济，开辟自由市场。一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派还疯狂推行“包产到户”，让我们“人合心，马合套，强找强，弱找弱”，自愿编组。硬把我们大队二百多户，分成十八个组，把三十几户贫下中农排挤在外，逼成单干，重新打入苦海。
    这些事实就是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的铁证。妄想让我们贫农下中农重走回头路，再吃二遍苦的是他；妄想让地主、富农重新复活，更加残酷地剥削我们贫下中农的也是他。亲身经历使我们更加看清了，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所推行的“三自一包”不是别的，就是射向社会主义的一支毒箭；就是砍掉人民公社集体经济的一把大毒刀；就是瓦解社员集体主义思想的一服腐蚀剂。归根到底一句话：就是要使社会主义倒退，资本主义大复辟。
    毛主席说：“除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”农业合作化的光辉历史，远大前程，使我们广大贫下中农深深体会到，只有紧跟毛主席，坚持社会主义方向，才能获得彻底解放。我们坚决跟定伟大舵手毛主席，在大风大浪中前进，把革命进行到底。
