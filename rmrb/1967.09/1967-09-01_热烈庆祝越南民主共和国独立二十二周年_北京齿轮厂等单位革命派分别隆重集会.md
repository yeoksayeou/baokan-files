In recent days, revolutionary workers of the Beijing Gear Factory, Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers of the Beijing Institute of Politics and Law, and members of the Beijing-China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune have held grand meetings to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, vowing to be a strong backing for the Vietnamese people and to stand shoulder to shoulder with them to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

The delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, led by Chairman Nguyen Van Hien and Vice Chairman He Kui, participated in the celebrations.

Lai Chung Shi, Lai Guang Xiang, and Su An from the Vietnamese Embassy in China, and representatives Li Song Shan and Nguan Shun He from the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, also attended the celebrations.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the three units warmly welcomed the Vietnamese comrades from the front lines of the anti-American struggle, celebrating the glorious holiday of the Vietnamese people. When the Vietnamese guests arrived, they were joyous, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" They beat drums and gongs, lining the streets to welcome them.

Representatives from the Beijing Gear Factory, the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Institute of Politics and Law, and the responsible persons of the Beijing-China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune spoke at the celebrations, praising the great victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. They set a brilliant example for the struggle of oppressed nations and peoples around the world to gain freedom and liberation, and also provided great support and encouragement to the Chinese people. They said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao said: 'The U.S. imperialists and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The Chinese people's struggle has proved this. The Vietnamese people's struggle is proving this.' No matter how the U.S. imperialists play the trick of 'escalating the war' or the fraud of 'ceasefire and talks,' they cannot shake the iron will and confidence in victory of the Vietnamese military and people to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism."

Nguyen Van Hien and He Kui spoke at these meetings, introducing the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. They said, "No matter how long the U.S. imperialists want to fight, we will definitely defeat them and complete the sacred cause of defending the North, liberating the South, and reunifying the country. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the Vietnamese people."

Nguyen Van Hien presented gifts made from the wreckage of downed American planes to the revolutionary masses. Revolutionary cultural performances or film screenings were also held at these celebrations.

　　热烈庆祝越南民主共和国独立二十二周年
　　北京齿轮厂等单位革命派分别隆重集会
    据新华社三十一日讯 连日来，北京齿轮厂革命职工，北京政法学院红卫兵小将、革命师生和北京中越友好人民公社社员，分别隆重集会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立二十二周年。他们共同表示：坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，随时准备和越南人民并肩战斗，彻底消灭美国侵略者。
    由阮文煊团长、何桂副团长率领的越中友协代表团参加了庆祝会。
    越南驻华大使馆参赞黎终始、黎光相、苏安，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表黎松山、阮顺和也分别参加了庆祝会。
    三个单位的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，热烈欢迎来自抗美斗争最前线的越南同志，庆祝越南人民的光辉节日。当越南客人来到时，他们喜气洋洋，捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”敲锣打鼓，夹道欢迎。
    齿轮厂革命职工代表、政法学院革命委员会主任、中越友好人民公社负责人在庆祝会上讲话中，热情赞扬了英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的伟大胜利，为世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取自由和解放的斗争树立了光辉榜样，也给了中国人民以巨大支持和鼓舞。他们说，我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“美帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎。中国人民的斗争证明了这一点。越南人民的斗争正在证明这一点。”不管美帝国主义玩弄“战争升级”的讹诈和“停战和谈”的骗局，都动摇不了越南军民彻底打败美帝国主义的钢铁意志和必胜信心。
    阮文煊团长和何桂副团长分别在这些会上讲话，介绍了越南人民抗美救国斗争所取得的伟大胜利。他们说，不管美帝国主义要打多久，我们要坚决战胜他们，坚决完成保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国的神圣事业，我们坚信最后胜利一定属于越南人民。
    阮文煊团长把越南人民用打下的美国飞机残骸制成的礼品送给了革命群众。在这些庆祝会上还演出了革命文艺节目或放映了电影。
