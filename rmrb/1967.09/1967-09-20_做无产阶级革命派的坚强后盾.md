The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with an unparalleled momentum, surges forward in the direction pointed by the greatest and most brilliant helmsman of human history, Chairman Mao.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is the pillar of our proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is not only adept at fighting enemies with guns but also at fighting enemies with pens. This is a truly proletarian revolutionary army that excels in both military and cultural affairs, unmatched in the world. In the complex and acute environment of domestic and international class struggle, without the great wall of the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no solid national defense, no strong proletarian dictatorship, no great socialist democracy, and no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary armed group that performs political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting; apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it also has to undertake major tasks such as propaganda, organization, arming the masses, helping the masses establish revolutionary governments, and even building Communist Party organizations." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our army, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively engages in the "three supports, two militaries" work. The "three supports, two militaries" are the glorious missions entrusted to our army by Chairman Mao under new historical conditions, the greatest trust, care, and protection for our army. The broad cadre and soldiers of our army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary forces, unite with the broad masses, and bravely charge against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, delivering a devastating blow to the bourgeois headquarters. At the same time, we actively implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Vice Chairman Lin says: "The surging mass movement, in turn, greatly inspires and educates the army, becoming a revolutionary crucible for tempering and raising the political awareness of the army." The fiery struggles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have provided the broad cadre and soldiers of our army with the best and greatest tempering, greatly enhancing their class struggle perspective and mass perspective, greatly strengthening the military-civilian relations, greatly increasing the consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and greatly accelerating the process of becoming more proletarian and more combat-ready, pushing the construction of our army to a new stage and greatly enhancing our army's combat effectiveness.

In the "three supports, two militaries" work, our army has accumulated rich experience. These experiences, in a nutshell, are to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and steadfastly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, becoming the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

The proletarian revolutionary forces are the backbone of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the vanguard against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Without them, it would be impossible to create a magnificent revolutionary momentum and achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To deny them is to deny the revolution. To attack them is to attack the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has always been correct.

The attitude towards the proletarian revolutionary forces is, in essence, the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought can one, in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, see clearly the political direction of various mass organizations and truly stand with the proletarian revolutionary forces. Loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means closeness to the proletarian revolutionary forces, regardless of their numbers or difficulties, and with proletarian revolutionary courage, stepping forward and firmly supporting them without wavering.

Supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces will inevitably face opposition and sabotage from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. They incite a part of the deceived masses to exert various pressures on the army, attempting to make us deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the right or "left" or both sides, split and destroy our revolutionary ranks, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The line is the concentrated expression of class interests. "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." We firmly believe that as long as we steadfastly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will stand high, see far, stand firm, and withstand the pressure. Firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces is an important manifestation of upholding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Arming the proletarian revolutionary forces with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental, key, and central task of the "three supports, two militaries" work. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual force and the source of all victories. The process of "three supports, two militaries" is the process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, helping the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and planting Mao Zedong Thought deeply in the minds of the broad masses. Vice Chairman Lin says: "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power," "they can be invincible, conquer all, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

"Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution." In the complex class struggle, we and the proletarian revolutionary forces together study and apply Chairman Mao's works, clarify the direction, identify the enemy, correctly distinguish and properly handle the two types of contradictions, grasp the overall direction of the struggle, launch a revolutionary criticism, concentrate firepower, concentrate targets, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, helping the proletarian revolutionary forces to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

For revolutionary mass organizations with different viewpoints, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, explain to them that the fundamental interests of the proletariat are the same, promote their revolutionary great alliance, rather than favoring one side and alienating another, pulling one side and attacking another. We support them when they are right and persuade them when they are wrong. We help the proletarian revolutionary forces correctly treat organizations with some differences and deceived masses and erring cadres, through the model actions of the proletarian revolutionary forces and in-depth and detailed political and ideological work, unite the broad masses and the majority of cadres, "strive to unite all those who can be united," organize a mighty revolutionary army, achieve and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" in the revolutionary great criticism, consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship.

In the "three supports, two militaries" work, helping the proletarian revolutionary forces to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative leadership team of the proletariat is a very important issue. Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor. Therefore, it is our combat task to train a large number of new cadres in a planned way." Vice Chairman Lin also points out: "Power is the issue of this leadership team. If the leadership team is good, it can guarantee the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the interests of the proletariat will be guaranteed." We help the leadership team of the proletarian revolutionary forces to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, strictly demand of themselves with the five conditions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. We spread to them the experience of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and doing good political and ideological work, helping them to hold power properly and use power properly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." Only by following from above and relying on the masses below can we implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to our army by Chairman Mao. Following from above means closely following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Chairman Mao is the greatest genius, far-sighted, and confident. For Chairman Mao's instructions and deployments, we will firmly execute what we understand and also firmly execute what we temporarily do not understand, and under any circumstances, we will not deviate or interfere. We should report more and report more, always placing ourselves under the absolute leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Relying on the masses below means believing in and relying on the broad revolutionary masses. The core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. In the "three supports, two militaries," for the revolutionary actions of the broad masses, we will firmly support them; for the new things that emerge in the movement, we will cherish them with enthusiasm; for different opinions, we will listen to them seriously; for their shortcomings and errors, we will patiently and kindly enlighten them to recognize and correct them themselves. When encountering problems, we should not take over and replace them, but let them do it themselves, so that they can be tempered in actual work and grow in the fiery class struggle.

The process of "three supports, two militaries" is also the best process for us to learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces, Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and revolutionary masses. The proletarian revolutionary forces are our best teachers. Their boundless love for Chairman Mao, their revolutionary rebellious spirit, and their heroic deeds in the struggle between the two lines have deeply educated us, making us more determined to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. In front of the revolutionary masses, we are forever students who have not graduated.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable, we ask for fewer. Once mistakes are made, we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." "Three supports, two militaries" is a new topic, and due to the lack of experience in the complex class struggle, it is inevitable that there will be various shortcomings and errors. Once there are errors, we should welcome the people's criticism, frankly admit, publicly reflect, and firmly, quickly, happily, seriously, and thoroughly correct them. As long as we correct them seriously, we can gain experience and win the trust and support of the broad revolutionary masses. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "As long as we persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely thrive."

The People's Liberation Army most supports the proletarian revolutionary forces, and the proletarian revolutionary forces most love their army. The broad revolutionary masses remember Chairman Mao's teachings of believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, supporting the army's revolutionary actions. For the shortcomings and errors in our work, they always enthusiastically help us correct them. They regard cherishing the army and maintaining the army's prestige as maintaining the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, maintaining the proletarian dictatorship, and maintaining the fundamental interests of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. The support and trust of the broad revolutionary masses are the source of our strength to defeat the class enemies and an important guarantee for doing the "three supports, two militaries" work well.

Our great leader Chairman Mao issues the call of "support the army and love the people," which is the strategic slogan to promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the general principle to correctly handle military-civilian relations, and the great force to inspire us to win new victories. Faithfully executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces, bravely defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the greatest love for the people. We will forever stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, take the greatest responsibility, cherish and support all proletarian revolutionary forces, all Red Guards revolutionary youngsters, and all revolutionary masses, unite with them, fight with them, and win with them, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, and with practical actions, respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement."

    做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾	吴法宪
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，以无与伦比的气势，沿着人类历史上最伟大最天才的舵手毛主席指引的方向，奔腾向前。
    由伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是我国无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命的坚强柱石。它不仅善于同拿枪杆子的敌人作战，而且善于同拿笔杆子的敌人作战。这是一支文武双全、举世无双的真正的无产阶级革命军队。在国内外阶级斗争尖锐复杂的环境下，没有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军这座伟大的长城，就不可能有巩固的国防，就不可能有坚强的无产阶级专政，就不可能有社会主义大民主，就不可能有无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛主席教导说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我军遵照毛主席的教导，积极投入“三支”“两军”工作。“三支”“两军”，是毛主席在新的历史条件下赋予我军的光荣使命，是对我军最大的信任、最大的关怀、最大的爱护。我军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，团结广大群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了英勇的冲杀，给资产阶级司令部以毁灭性的打击。同时，积极贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大大推动了工农业生产的发展。
    林副主席说：“汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是反过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。”无产阶级文化大革命的火热斗争，使我军广大指战员，获得最大和最好的锻炼，大大增强了阶级斗争观点和群众观点，大大密切了军民关系，大大提高了执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，大大加速了非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的进程，把我军建设推进到一个新的阶段，极大地加强了我军的战斗力。
    在“三支”“两军”工作中，我军积累了丰富的经验。这些经验，集中到一点，就是必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。
    无产阶级革命派，是无产阶级文化大革命的中坚，是反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的先锋。没有他们，便不能造成轰轰烈烈的革命声势，便不能取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。
    对待无产阶级革命派的态度，实质上就是对待毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度，就是对待无产阶级文化大革命的态度。只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，看清各个群众组织的政治方向，才能真正同无产阶级革命派站在一起。对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠，就会对无产阶级革命派亲，不管他们人数多少，困难多大，都会以无产阶级的革命胆略，挺身而出，毫不动摇地坚决支持他们。
    支持无产阶级革命派，必然会遭到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反对和破坏，他们煽动一部分受蒙蔽的群众，对军队施加种种压力，妄图从右的方面或“左”的方面或同时从两方面，拉我们背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，分裂和破坏我们的革命队伍，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。路线是阶级利益的集中表现。“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”我们坚信，只要坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，就会站得高，看得远，立得稳，顶得住。坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，就是坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要表现。
    用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，这是“三支”“两军”工作中根本的根本，关键的关键，中心的中心。毛泽东思想是最强大的精神力量，是一切胜利的源泉。“三支”“两军”的过程，就是宣传毛泽东思想的过程，就是要帮助广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，使毛泽东思想在广大群众的头脑里扎下根来。林副主席说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量”，“就能够所向披靡，攻无不克，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利”。
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，我们和无产阶级革命派一起活学活用毛主席著作，辨明方向，认清敌人，严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，掌握斗争的大方向，开展革命的大批判，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，帮助无产阶级革命派搞好本单位的斗批改。
    对待持有不同观点的革命群众组织，我们遵循毛主席的教导，向他们说明无产阶级的根本利益是一致的，促进他们的革命大联合，而不是亲一派，疏一派，拉一派，打一派。他们做得对的，就支持，做得不对的，就劝阻。帮助无产阶级革命派正确对待同自己有某些分歧的组织，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部，通过无产阶级革命派的模范行动和深入细致的政治思想工作，团结广大群众，团结干部的大多数，“争取团结一切可以团结的人们”，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，在革命的大批判中，实现和巩固革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    在“三支”“两军”工作中，帮助无产阶级革命派建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的领导班子，这是一个很重要的问题。毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。因此，有计划地培养大批的新干部，就是我们的战斗任务。”林副主席也指出：“政权就是这个班子的问题，班子搞好了，能保证毛主席革命路线的执行，无产阶级的利益就有保证。”我们帮助无产阶级革命派的领导班子，加强毛主席著作的学习，以无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件严格要求自己，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。我们把人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，做好政治思想工作的经验传播给他们，帮助他们掌好权、用好权。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”只有跟上靠下，才能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能完成毛主席赋予我军的光荣任务。跟上，就是紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。毛主席是最伟大的天才，高瞻远瞩，成竹在胸。对毛主席的指示和部署，我们理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在任何情况下都决不背离，决不干扰。要多请示，多报告，时刻把自己置于毛主席的无产阶级司令部的绝对领导之下。靠下，就是相信和依靠广大革命群众。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心，就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。在“三支”“两军”中，对广大群众的革命行动，要坚定不移地支持；对运动中出现的新生事物，要满腔热情地爱护；对不同意见，要认真地听取；对他们的缺点和错误，要谆谆善诱地启发他们自己认识和纠正。遇到问题，不要包办代替，放手让他们去做，使他们在实际工作中经受锻炼，在火热的阶级斗争中成长。
    “三支”“两军”的过程，也就是我们向无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和革命群众学习的最好的过程。无产阶级革命派是我们最好的老师。他们对毛主席的无限热爱，他们的革命造反精神，他们在两条路线斗争中的英勇事迹，深深地教育了我们，使我们更加坚定了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。在革命群众面前，我们永远是没有毕业的小学生。
    毛主席教导说：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”“三支”“两军”是一个崭新的课题，在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，由于缺乏经验，难免发生这样那样的缺点和错误。有了错误，就要欢迎人民群众批评指出，爽直承认，公开检讨，并且坚决地改，迅速地改，痛痛快快地改，认真地改，彻底地改。只要认真改了，就可以取得经验，取得广大革命群众的信任和拥护。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”
    人民解放军最支持无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派最热爱自己的军队。广大革命群众牢记毛主席相信和依靠人民解放军的教导，支持解放军的一切革命行动。对我们工作中的缺点和错误，他们总是满腔热情地帮助我们改正。他们把爱护解放军，维护解放军的威信，看成就是维护无产阶级文化大革命，维护无产阶级专政，维护亿万革命人民的根本利益。广大革命群众的支持和信任，是我们战胜阶级敌人的力量源泉，是做好“三支”“两军”工作的重要保证。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“拥军爱民”的号召，是推进无产阶级文化大革命的战略口号，是正确处理军民关系的总原则，是鼓舞我们夺取新胜利的巨大力量。忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，勇敢保卫无产阶级文化大革命，是最大的爱民。我们要永远站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，尽最大责任，爱护和支持一切无产阶级革命派、一切红卫兵革命小将和一切革命群众，同他们紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底打倒以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以实际行动响应林副主席的号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”。
