At a critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Shanghai working class and the revolutionary masses from all fronts have set a brilliant example of great unity. We must learn from the Shanghai working class, unite swiftly, and follow the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The practice of the revolutionary great unity in Shanghai tells us: the working class has a heart that loves Chairman Mao, a heart that is determined to follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do. Wherever the great leader points, they follow.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions teach us: within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

Before liberation, workers were like bitter gourds on the same vine, all suffering from exploitation and oppression. To fight for freedom and liberation, to overthrow the common enemy, the working class often risked their lives to unite and join together. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they bravely fought against the enemy. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the persecution of the capitalist roaders, the working class and the revolutionary masses from all fronts united tightly, smashed the various tricks of the class enemies, and exposed the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Every revolutionary comrade, as long as they think of the revolutionary interests of the entire working class and the interests of the Party, will throw away all sectarianism, cliquism, and the like, and will voluntarily free themselves from factions and small groups, contributing their strength to promote revolutionary great unity.

At present, it is the time to organize a mighty army to launch a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. No organization can find any reason to split further. Whoever still creates factions and sectarianism will inevitably be despised by the masses. We must, like the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai proletariat, swiftly gather in the great ranks of revolutionary great unity, concentrate our forces, focus our targets, and launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    向上海工人阶级学习，联合起来闹革命
    正当无产阶级文化大革命进入到最关键的时刻，具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级和各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，给我们作出了革命大联合的光辉榜样。我们一定要向上海工人阶级学习，迅速地联合起来，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    上海革命大联合的实践告诉我们：工人阶级有一颗热爱毛主席的红心，有一颗要永远紧跟毛主席革命到底的决心。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么干。伟大领袖指向哪里，他们就跟向哪里。
    毛主席最新指示教导我们说：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
    解放前，工人是一根藤上的苦瓜，都是受剥削受压迫的。为了争取自由和解放，为了打倒共同的敌人，工人阶级常常冒着生命的危险联合在一起，团结在一起，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，同敌人展开了英勇的战斗。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在资产阶级反动路线的迫害下，工人阶级和各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，也是紧紧地联合在一起，粉碎了阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。每个革命同志只要想到整个工人阶级的革命利益、党的利益，什么山头主义、小团体主义等等，都会统统丢得一干二净，就会自觉地从山头上、小团体中解放出来，为促进革命的大联合贡献自己的力量。
    当前，正是组织浩浩荡荡大军向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的时候，任何一个组织都找不出任何理由再闹分裂。谁还搞山头、闹宗派，谁就必然遭到群众的唾弃。我们要象上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众那样，以最迅速的步伐，集结在革命大联合的伟大行列里，集中力量，集中目标，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部猛烈开火，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
