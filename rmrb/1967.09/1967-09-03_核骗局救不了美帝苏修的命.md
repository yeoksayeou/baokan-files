The draft of the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" concocted by the United States and the Soviet Union has finally been thrown out at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. This is a concrete result of the secret talks between the heads of the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists, Glasburg and Rommel, and a major step in their intensified global counter-revolutionary collusion. It is also another treacherous act by the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique in betraying the interests of the peoples of the world.

Currently, international class struggle is becoming increasingly fierce, and the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world are surging. The days of the United States and the Soviet Union are getting worse. In this situation, they hurriedly put forward this treaty draft, hyping it up, in order to create an atmosphere of "US-Soviet cooperation" to facilitate their global collusion. Especially on the Vietnam issue, US imperialism and Soviet revisionism are intensifying their plot of "bombing to force negotiations." They want to create conditions for further dirty deals on the Vietnam issue. Obviously, the actions of the United States and the Soviet Union are to use this "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" to promote their anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary, and anti-China evil activities, in order to resist the revolutionary tide of the world.

The United States and the Soviet Union have been plotting the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" for several years. Initially, one of their main purposes was to attempt to restrain China's hands and prevent China from mastering nuclear weapons. However, before the treaty was even finalized, China had already developed the atomic bomb, missiles, and even the hydrogen bomb. The great achievements of the Chinese people in this regard have dealt a fatal blow to the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail policies of the United States and the Soviet Union, and have greatly encouraged the revolutionary peoples of the world. The United States and the Soviet Union are hastening to concoct the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" precisely to use it to incite anti-China sentiment and limit the international influence of socialist China.

The treaty draft proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union stipulates that non-nuclear countries are not allowed to develop and possess nuclear weapons, and even prohibits them from developing nuclear explosive devices in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This means giving the United States and the Soviet Union the privilege of nuclear blackmail for aggression, while those non-nuclear countries that are threatened and invaded are not only deprived of the right to develop nuclear weapons to resist US-Soviet nuclear threats but also have their development of peaceful nuclear industry subject to unreasonable interference and control by the United States and the Soviet Union. Obviously, the United States and the Soviet Union are using this treaty to place all non-nuclear countries in a "protected" and subordinate position, while they can maintain the special status of nuclear powers and continue to act as "nuclear bullies."

The United States and the Soviet Union are vigorously advocating that signing the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" will "achieve nuclear disarmament" and will "contribute to the cause of preventing nuclear war threats." Is this really the case?

Everyone knows that the source of contemporary war is the imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys. The threat of nuclear war comes from US imperialism and its accomplices. The so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" does not hinder the United States and the Soviet Union from manufacturing and stockpiling nuclear weapons, nor does it hinder them from using nuclear weapons in war. Moreover, the United States has already established many nuclear bases around the world. US aircraft and submarines carrying nuclear warheads are roaming around various continents and oceans. US nuclear weapons have already spread all over the world. Furthermore, the US-Soviet "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" draft does not hinder German militarism from obtaining nuclear weapons through the "nuclear defense" committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Where is there any sign of "nuclear disarmament" in this? Where is there any "prevention of nuclear war threats"? If they really want to prevent nuclear war, then why don't they propose a complete ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons?

The US-Soviet "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" is purely a fraud. They just want to use this treaty to lull people's vigilance, so that under the cover of this treaty, they can more brazenly engage in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, control and bully other countries, and sabotage the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, in order to realize their dream of world domination.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that the US imperialists have in their hands are not enough to frighten all the people who do not want to be slaves." Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is colluding with US imperialism, attempting to use the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" to maintain their already bankrupt nuclear monopoly position, using the few atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in their hands to jointly confront the revolutionary peoples of the world. However, the nuclear fraud will not help them, and atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs will not save their lives. Since they have made enemies of all the peoples of the world, they will inevitably meet their doom.

　　核骗局救不了美帝苏修的命
　　本报评论员
    美苏合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约草案，终于在日内瓦裁军会议上抛出来了。这是美帝苏修头子葛拉斯堡罗密谈的一个具体结果，是它们加紧实行全球反革命勾结的一个重大步骤，也是勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团出卖世界人民利益的又一叛卖罪行。
    当前，国际阶级斗争日趋激烈，世界人民革命运动日益高涨。美苏两家的日子越来越不好混了。在这种情况下，它们急急忙忙地端出这个条约草案来，加以大吹大擂，是要竭力制造美苏“合作”的气氛，便于它们进行全球性大勾结。特别是在越南问题上，美帝苏修正在加紧策划“以炸迫和”的新阴谋。它们要为在越南问题上进一步达成肮脏的交易创造条件。很显然，美苏的这种做法，是想借这一纸“防止核扩散”条约来推动它们的反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的罪恶活动，以抵挡世界的革命潮流。
    美苏策划“防止核扩散”条约已经有好几年了。当初，它们的一个主要目的，是妄图束缚中国的手脚，阻止中国掌握核武器。可是，条约还没搞成，中国就有了原子弹，有了导弹，还有了氢弹。中国人民在这方面的伟大成就，给美苏的核垄断和核讹诈政策以致命的打击，而使世界革命人民感到极大的鼓舞。美苏加紧炮制“防止核扩散”条约，就是想用它来煽动反华，限制社会主义中国的国际影响。
    美苏提出的条约草案规定，无核国家不得发展和拥有核武器，甚至不得在和平利用原子能方面发展核爆炸装置。这样，就等于是给了美苏进行核讹诈的侵略特权，而那些遭受威胁和侵略的无核国家，不但被剥夺了发展核武器以抵抗美苏核威胁的权利，而且连它们发展和平核工业，也要受美苏的无理干预和控制。显然，美苏搞这个条约，就是要把一切无核国家置于被“保护”的、从属的地位，而它们却可以保持核大国的特殊地位，继续充当“核霸王”。
    美苏竭力鼓吹，签订“防止核扩散”条约，就能“实现核裁军”，并且会“对防止核战争威胁事业作出贡献”。事情果真是这样吗？
    人们都知道，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗是当代战争的根源。核战争威胁是来自美帝国主义及其帮凶。所谓“防止核扩散”条约，既不妨碍美苏制造和储存核武器，也不妨碍它们在战争中使用核武器。不仅如此，美国早在世界各地建立了许多核基地，带核弹头的美国飞机和潜艇，在各大洲、各大洋窜来窜去，美国的核武器已经扩散到了全世界。而且，美苏的“防止核扩散”条约草案，也不妨碍西德军国主义通过北大西洋集团“核防务”委员会染指核武器。这哪里有一点点什么“核裁军”的影子呢？这哪里是什么“防止核战争的威胁”呢？如果它们真想防止核战争，那么，为什么它们不提出全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器呢？
    美苏的“防止核扩散”条约纯粹是个骗局。它们不过是要用这一纸条约来麻痹人们的警惕，以便在这个条约的掩盖下，更加放手地大搞核讹诈和核威胁，控制和欺侮别的国家，破坏世界人民革命运动，以实现它们称霸世界的迷梦。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。”现在，苏修集团同美帝串通一气，妄图用“防止核扩散”条约来维持它们已经破产的核垄断地位，用它们手中的几颗原子弹、氢弹共同对付世界革命人民。但是，核骗局帮不了它们的忙，原子弹、氢弹也救不了它们的命。它们既然同全世界人民为敌，就绝对逃脱不了必然灭亡的命运。
