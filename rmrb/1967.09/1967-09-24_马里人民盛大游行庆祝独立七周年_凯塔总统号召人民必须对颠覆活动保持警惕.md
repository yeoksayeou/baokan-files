Malians held a grand parade in the capital, Bamako, on September 22 to celebrate the 7th anniversary of their independence. The parade demonstrated their firm resolve to defend national independence and fight against imperialism.

Participants in the parade carried banners and marched past the reviewing stand. The banners read: "We must always be vigilant against the cunning tactics of imperialism!" "We will block the way for domestic and foreign reactionaries!" The reviewing stand was occupied by Mali's President and Chairman of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Modibo Keita, as well as members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution and government ministers.

Before the parade began, Keita inspected the Malian troops and delivered a speech. In his address, he called on the Malian people to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, which are tools of imperialism, and to destroy the enemy. He emphasized that the Malian people must remain vigilant against subversive activities.

Keita reiterated that the Malian people firmly support and stand in solidarity with the brothers and heroes of Angola, Mozambique, Southern Rhodesia, South West Africa, South Africa (Azania), and Vietnam.

Participants in the parade included citizens of Bamako, male and female militia members in uniform carrying guns, and the Malian army.
