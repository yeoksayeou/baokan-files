The revolutionary factions of the twenty-four units under the Beijing Radio and Television Factory have responded swiftly to the call and achieved great unity in revolution. According to a report from our newspaper, "Follow closely, follow closely, follow even more closely, unite, unite, and achieve great unity." The proletarian revolutionary factions of the twenty-four units under the Beijing Radio and Television Factory have responded swiftly to the call, earnestly studied, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. On the 20th, they held a unity meeting, joyfully achieving revolutionary great unity. The entire factory's workers are enthusiastically seizing the revolution and promoting production, determined to create even greater achievements to welcome National Day.

This combined enterprise has twenty-two factories and two administrative departments. In the past, due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the influence of their bourgeois reactionary line, the workers in each factory were divided into two opposing factions, seriously hindering the smooth progress of the revolutionary criticism and production. Recently, Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. All units immediately launched a wave of extensive study and great unity. The workers were very excited and said, "Chairman Mao has spoken the words of our working class. We must resolutely follow his teachings." "A thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, without following Chairman Mao's teachings to achieve revolutionary great unity, there is no reason." The workers discussed and debated, reflecting their strong desire to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity.

However, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations could not immediately change their minds, allowing selfishness to prevail, and still saying to their brother organizations, "If you want to unite, you must admit your mistakes," "Past differences must be settled first," and so on. The stationed soldiers immediately organized the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations to sit together, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related works, guiding both sides to consciously engage in more self-criticism and mutual understanding. They said: We revolutionary mass organizations can find ten contradictions, a hundred contradictions, but none are greater than the contradictions with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; among our class brothers, we can find ten accounts, a hundred accounts, but none are greater than the class struggle accounts with Chinese Khrushchev. The broad masses of workers also actively urged the leaders of their own organizations to eliminate factionalism and unite against the enemy. As a result, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary mass organizations of the twenty-four units quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

　　北京无线电联合厂二十四个单位革命派
　　闻风而动实现革命大联合
    本报讯“紧跟、紧跟、再紧跟，联合、联合、大联合”，北京无线电联合厂所属二十四个单位的无产阶级革命派，闻风而动，认真学习和坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，二十日召开了团结大会，欢欣鼓舞地实现了革命的大联合。全厂职工高高兴兴地抓革命促生产，决心创造更大的成绩迎接国庆节。
    这个联合企业下属有二十二个工厂，两个行政部门。过去，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑动和他们推行的资产阶级反动路线的影响，每个厂的工人都分成对立的两大派，严重地妨碍了革命大批判和生产的顺利进行。最近，毛主席发出了最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。所有单位都立刻掀起了一个大学习、大联合的高潮。工人们十分兴奋地说：“毛主席说出了咱们工人阶级的心里话，我们要坚决照办。”“千条理，万条理，不按照毛主席的教导实现革命大联合就没有理。”工人们谈心串连，酝酿讨论，反映了要求迅速实现革命大联合的强烈愿望。
    但是，有的革命群众组织负责人的思想一时转不过弯来，任凭私字作怪，还对兄弟组织说什么“要联合，你们就得认错”，“过去的分歧必须先弄个水落石出”，等等。驻厂的解放军同志，立即组织各革命群众组织负责人坐在一起，学习毛主席的最新指示和有关著作，引导双方自觉地多作自我批评，互相取得谅解。他们说：我们革命群众组织之间可以找出十条矛盾、百条矛盾，但没有一条大过与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾；我们阶级兄弟之间，可以找到十笔账，百笔账，但没有一笔能大过与中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级斗争账。广大工人也积极督促本组织的负责人铲除山头，团结对敌。结果，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，二十四个单位的革命群众组织迅速实现了革命的大联合。
