Sikkim is a country in the Himalayas, bordering China, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Imperialists once used Sikkim as a bridgehead to invade China. Now, the Indian reactionaries, under the orders of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are using Sikkim's territory to continually carry out aggressive activities against China.

Sikkim is a hereditary monarchy, with the head of state being the Chogyal. Its area is 7,100 square kilometers, with a population of over 160,000. As early as the 19th century, British imperialists invaded Sikkim. In 1887, Britain forcibly occupied Sikkim and subsequently declared that Sikkim was under British "protection," sending a "political officer" to Sikkim. After India's independence in 1947, the Indian reactionaries inherited the legacy of British imperialism, forcing Sikkim to sign the "Agreement to Maintain the Status Quo." In June 1949, the Indian reactionaries openly sent troops to occupy Sikkim. On December 5, 1950, the Indian reactionaries further forced Sikkim to sign the so-called "Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Sikkim," openly stipulating that Sikkim is an "Indian protectorate." Thus, India became the only country in Asia to have a "protectorate."

India forcibly sent a so-called "Chief Executive of Sikkim," who actually exercises the powers of a prime minister. India also sent a "political officer" to Sikkim to represent the Indian government in controlling Sikkim's defense, foreign affairs, and transportation. India also has the right to station troops in Sikkim.

The Indian reactionaries' control and enslavement of Sikkim have deepened the suffering of the Sikkimese people, leading to increasing discontent and resistance among the people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    印度对锡金的控制
    锡金是喜马拉雅山麓的一个国家，分别和中国、不丹、印度、尼泊尔接壤。帝国主义曾经以锡金作为侵略中国的桥头堡。现在，印度反动派又在美帝和苏修的指使下，利用锡金的领土，不断对中国进行侵略活动。
    锡金是一个世袭的君主国，国家元首是大君。面积为七千一百平方公里，人口十六万多人。早在十九世纪，英国殖民主义者就侵入锡金。一八八七年，英国强占锡金，随后悍然宣布锡金受英国“保护”，并向锡金派驻“政治专员”。一九四七年印度独立后，印度反动派继承英帝国主义的衣钵，强迫锡金同它签订“维持现状协定”。一九四九年六月，印度反动派公然派兵进驻锡金。一九五○年十二月五日，印度反动派进一步强迫锡金签订所谓“印度和锡金和平条约”，公然规定锡金是印度的“保护国”。这样，印度成了亚洲唯一有“保护国”的国家。
    印度向锡金强行派出所谓“锡金首席行政官”，实际上执行首相的职权。印度并在锡金派驻“政治专员”，代表印度政府控制锡金的国防、外交和交通等大权。印度还有权在锡金境内驻军。
    印度反动派对锡金的控制和奴役，加深了锡金人民的痛苦，引起了锡金人民的日益不满和反抗。（新华社）
