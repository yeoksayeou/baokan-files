The U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam, due to increasing failures, has fallen into an inescapable predicament. From the wails emanating recently from within the U.S. ruling class and U.S. bourgeois newspapers, one can fully see the desperate situation Johnson's government faces in the Vietnam War.

In an attempt to reverse the passive situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam and to strike and annihilate the main force of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, U.S. imperialism and its puppets launched a large-scale dry-season offensive in the winter and spring of 1966-1967. Particularly in the areas south of the demilitarized zone, they concentrated their forces for a frenzied attack. However, after several months of confrontation, this offensive by the U.S. invading forces and the Saigon puppet army, after suffering a loss of 175,000 casualties (including 70,000 U.S. troops), has completely failed. U.S. news agencies and newspapers admit that in the first few months of this year, "the proportion of U.S. casualties far exceeded that of 1966 and was even higher than during the Korean War." In the fierce battles south of the demilitarized zone, U.S. newspapers admit that the U.S. Marine Corps alone suffered 10,000 casualties, while the combat capability of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army "has not been damaged" and it can still "attack very powerfully."

The more troops they send, the more they fail.

The U.S. imperialist military defeat shows the bankruptcy of its strategy and tactics, and fully exposes the fatal weakness of the long and thin U.S. war front in Vietnam, with insufficient troops. The Wall Street Journal laments, "This is a war of attrition, not annihilation," and the U.S. invading forces "cannot fight this war in the usual way." U.S. News and World Report admits, "Many tactical concepts taught in U.S. military academies like a religion do not work at all in the jungles and mountains of Vietnam." Some U.S. newspapers reveal that although the U.S. forces in South Vietnam have increased to 460,000, in reality, only 80 combat battalions (80,000 troops) and 20,000 artillery troops can actually be deployed, accounting for only four to five percent of the total U.S. forces in Vietnam. In fact, the more U.S. troops are sent, the more the front line is stretched, the more they are divided, and the more they are in a passive position, taking blows.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in 1946 in his "Three-Month Summary of the Chinese People's Liberation War" that the 190-plus regiments of the Kuomintang forces attacking the liberated areas "must use nearly half of them for defense, with only a little more than half available for mobile warfare. And these mobile forces, when they advance to a certain area, inevitably have to use part or most of them for defense. The enemy's mobile forces, on the one hand, are constantly being annihilated by us, and on the other hand, are largely engaged in defense. Therefore, they must become fewer and fewer the more they fight." Today, the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam, divided and isolated in the sea of people's war, are in a similar situation.

To make up for the shortage of U.S. forces in Vietnam, Johnson recently, after sending Defense Secretary McNamara, envoy Taylor, and Army Chief of Staff Harold Johnson to Vietnam to assess the situation and troop strength, has decided to send an additional 40,000-plus troops. Of course, this is just a drop in the bucket. What is now greatly troubling the Washington authorities is not only that the U.S. has no more troops to send but also that even a large increase in troops will still be of no avail. The U.S. propaganda machine, when discussing the issue of further troop increases, helplessly admits, "Those who now say 600,000 is enough are the same people who once said 400,000 was enough." The only difference is that "we are sending more and more troops (alive) and bringing back more and more troops (wounded or dead)." The New York Times recently even made such an estimate: to stabilize the invasion position in South Vietnam, the U.S. "needs at least 8 million troops," which is more than three times the current total strength of the three services. This is equivalent to admitting that U.S. imperialism cannot possibly win in South Vietnam.

Air "escalation" also has no way out.

It is precisely because of the desperate situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam that some people in Washington are now advocating against U.S. troops "catching up to the enemy in man-to-man, bayonet-to-bayonet, and grenade-to-grenade combat," attempting to realize the "negotiation" plot through intensifying and expanding the air war against North Vietnam to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and stop the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end. The International Herald Tribune says, "The smaller the results the U.S. achieves in the Vietnam War, the more the White House seems to believe that the solution can only be further escalation." The recent frenzied bombing of Hanoi by the Johnson administration and the further expansion of bombing to areas near the Vietnam-China border are manifestations of U.S. imperialism's desperate struggle and war adventurism.

But can Johnson find a way out from this adventurous action? Even some U.S. bourgeois newspapers and influential figures within the U.S. ruling class express doubts about this. The International Herald Tribune's August 14 commentary says, "The U.S. cannot easily win through air bombing or intensified naval blockade. In fact, the escalation of aircraft is no more effective than the escalation of infantry, tanks, or trucks." Senate Democratic leader Mansfield also admits, "In escalation, the enemy can fight us to a standstill and even surpass us."

In fact, Johnson's adventurous war policy, due to the possibility of bringing extremely serious consequences to the U.S., has sparked a fierce debate within the U.S. ruling class. Recently, some U.S. congressmen have even publicly proposed to revoke the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress in 1964 after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, authorizing Johnson to expand the aggression in Southeast Asia. This resolution, at the time when U.S. aggression was very arrogant, was almost unanimously passed by the entire U.S. Congress. Due to this situation, Johnson has already anxiously admitted that the longer the fighting in Vietnam continues, the more sacrifices in personnel and materials are needed, the more different opinions there are, and the greater the difficulties. And the more difficult the situation becomes, the harder it is for some people to go along with us. Johnson's desperate and hopeless wails fully reflect the obvious weakness of U.S. imperialism in its frenzied adventurous aggression.

Of course, although the Johnson administration is in a desperate situation in the Vietnam War dead end, it will not accept defeat. Currently, it is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to continue playing the trick of "bombing to force negotiations" and "stopping bombing to lure negotiations," attempting to grab a lifeline from the already bankrupt "war escalation" action. However, it can be assured that the Vietnamese people, who have already achieved great victories in the anti-U.S. national salvation war, will not be intimidated or deceived by U.S. imperialism's aggression plots. The more Johnson struggles in his death throes, the faster his complete failure will come.

### 美帝“战争升级”救不了约翰逊的命

　　美帝“战争升级”救不了约翰逊的命
    美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，由于遭到越来越大的失败，已经陷入了不可解脱的困境。从美国统治集团内部和美国资产阶级报刊最近发出的一片哀鸣中，可以充分看出约翰逊政府今天在侵越战争中面临的走投无路的绝境。
    为了扭转在南越战场上被动挨打的局面，妄图打击和消灭南越解放军的主力，美帝国主义及其走狗曾在一九六六——一九六七年的冬春季节倾巢而出，发动大规模的旱季攻势，特别是在非军事区以南一带地区集结重兵发动疯狂进攻。但是，经过连续几个月的较量，美国侵略军和南越伪军的这个攻势，在付出了伤亡十七万五千人（包括美军七万人）的惨重代价以后，已经遭到了彻底的破产。美国通讯社和报刊承认，在今年头几个月内，“美军伤亡的比例数远远超过了一九六六年，并且比朝鲜战争时期还要高”。在非军事区以南的激战中，美国报刊承认美国海军陆战队就被歼灭了一万人，而南越解放军的“作战能力并没有遭到损害”，仍然能够“非常有力地进行攻击”。
　　增兵越多，败得越惨
    美帝国主义在军事上的惨败，说明了它的战略战术的破产，也充分暴露了侵越美军战线漫长、兵力不足的致命弱点。《华尔街日报》哀叹“这是一场消耗战而不是歼灭战”，美国侵略军“不能按常规的办法打这场战争”。《美国新闻与世界报道》承认，“在美国高级军校中象宗教那样教导的许多战术概念在越南的丛林和荒山中是根本不起作用的。”有的美国报刊透露，尽管美国在南越的兵力已经增加到四十六万人，但是实际上能够真正投入作战的部队，只有八十个战斗营（八万人）和炮兵两万人，只占侵越美军总数的四、五分之一。事实上，美军越是增兵扩战，就越要拉开战线，化整为零，处处陷于被动挨打的境地。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九四六年关于中国人民解放战争《三个月总结》中曾经指出，蒋介石国民党进攻解放区的一百九十几个旅兵力，“须以差不多半数任守备，能任野战者不过半数多一点。而这些任野战的兵力进到一定地区，又必不可免地要以一部至大部改任守备。敌人的野战军，一方面，不断地被我歼灭，另方面，大量地担任守备，因此，它就必定越打越少。”今天在南越人民战争的海洋中被东分西割的侵越美军，也是同样的情况。
    为了弥补美国侵越兵力的不足，约翰逊最近在连续派出国防部长麦克纳马拉、特使泰勒和陆军参谋长哈·约翰逊等人去南越了解战局和兵力情况以后，已经决定再增兵四万多人。当然，这不过是杯水车薪而已。现在使华盛顿当局大为困扰不安的不仅是美国无兵可增，而且是即使大量增兵也仍然无济于事。美国宣传机器在谈到进一步增兵的问题时，无可奈何地承认，“那些现在说六十万人就够了的人，就是那些一度说四十万就够了的人”，“唯一的差别是，我们派去越来越多的部队（活的），运回越来越多的部队（死伤的）”。《纽约时报》最近甚至作出这样的估计：为了稳住在南越的侵略阵地，美国“至少需要八百万军队”，也就是现有三军总数的三倍多。这等于承认，美帝国主义在南越是根本不可能取胜的。
　　空中“升级”，也无出路
    正是因为在南越战场上走投无路，华盛顿现在有人喊出了反对美军“在人对人、刺刀对刺刀和手榴弹对手榴弹方面赶上敌人”的主张，妄图通过加紧扩大轰炸越南北方的战争“升级”行动来实现“和谈”阴谋，迫使越南人民放下武器，停止把抗美救国战争进行到底。美国《国际先驱论坛报》说，美国在侵越战争中“取得的成果越小，白宫似乎越发相信，解决的办法就只有更进一步的升级”。约翰逊政府最近疯狂轰炸河内并且把轰炸进一步向中越交界附近地区扩展，就是美帝国主义这种绝望挣扎和战争冒险的表现。
    但是，约翰逊从这种冒险行动中难道就能找到出路吗？即使是美国的一些资产阶级报刊和美国统治集团内部的一些有影响人士也是对此表示怀疑的。《国际先驱论坛报》八月十四日的一篇评论说，美国“通过空中轰炸或加紧海军封锁”并不能轻易取胜，实际上“飞机的升级同步兵、坦克或卡车的升级一样，都没有什么可以显示的好处”。美国参议院民主党头子曼斯菲尔德也承认，“在升级方面敌人能够同我们打平手，并且胜过我们”。
　　“以炸迫和”，必然失败
    事实上，约翰逊的这种战争冒险政策，由于可能给美国带来极为严重的后果，已经在美国统治集团内部引起了一场激烈的争吵。最近有些美国议员甚至公开提出要撤销美国国会在一九六四年北部湾事件后授权约翰逊放手扩大侵略东南亚的决议。这个决议在美国侵略气焰十分嚣张的当时，几乎是经美国国会全体一致通过的。由于这种情况，约翰逊已经忧心忡忡地承认，在越南的“战斗持续得越长，在人员和物资方面所需要作出的牺牲就越多，不同的意见就越多，困难也就越大”，而“局势变得越困难，有些人就越难同我们一道走下去”。约翰逊的这种悲观失望的哀鸣，充分反映了美帝国主义在疯狂侵略的冒险性中表现出来的明显的虚弱性。
    当然，约翰逊政府尽管在侵越战争的死胡同中走投无路，它是决不会甘心失败的。目前，它勾结苏修领导集团一起，还在加紧玩弄“以炸迫和”与“停炸诱和”的阴谋，妄想从早已破产了的“战争升级”行动中捞一根救命草。但是，可以肯定，在抗美救国战争中已经赢得了伟大胜利的越南人民，是决不会被美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋所吓倒和蒙骗的。约翰逊越是进行垂死的挣扎，就越是会加速它的彻底失败的到来。
