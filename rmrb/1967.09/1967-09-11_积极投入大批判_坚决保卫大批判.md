The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. It is another heavy artillery shell that has struck the bourgeois headquarters, including Tao Zhu. We must unify our thoughts and actions with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively engage in the revolutionary great criticism, and resolutely defend the revolutionary great criticism!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." How do we support the broad masses of the left? At present, it is to help the left firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further ignite a new high tide of revolutionary great criticism, concentrate firepower, focus on targets, and from a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint, criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the Wuhan area. We must do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, and achieve, develop, and consolidate the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

To support the left, one must first be leftist; to help the left carry out the revolutionary great criticism, one must first be a model of revolutionary great criticism. In recent times, in addition to frequently engaging in great criticism with the revolutionary youngsters, our company's great criticism has also been getting better and better. Comrades, whether speaking at meetings or writing for wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, all aim at China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Wang Renzhong. Especially when linking to the ambitious and conspiratorial figures Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's promotion of the revisionist military line, comrades are passionate and enthusiastic, with greater momentum to thoroughly smash the bourgeois military line and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line.

The revolutionary great criticism has promoted the ideological revolutionization of all officers and soldiers in the company and has also improved our level of supporting the left. It is precisely because of this that the class enemy is terrified and hates the revolutionary great criticism. They use Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, attempting to disrupt the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, and attempting to act like the manipulators of the "May 16" counter-revolutionary organization to sabotage and split the great People's Liberation Army of China. This is simply a pipe dream! The People's Liberation Army of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never agree! We will never agree! We will forever not agree!

The revolutionary great criticism has also greatly strengthened our sense of preparedness. Our eyes are even more keen, and we are even more vigilant against the plots and sabotage activities of imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionists. If they dare to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate them. We are determined to defend the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, defend the full development of the revolutionary great criticism, and defend the complete realization of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment!

    积极投入大批判  坚决保卫大批判	武汉空军某部九连
    姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》的发表，大长无产阶级志气，大灭资产阶级威风。它是又一颗重型炮弹，狠狠地击中了包括陶铸在内的资产阶级司令部。我们一定要用毛主席的伟大战略部署来统一我们的思想，来统一我们的行动，积极投入革命的大批判，坚决保卫革命的大批判！
    毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”怎样支持左派广大群众呢？在当前就是要帮助左派牢牢掌握好斗争的大方向，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和武汉地区的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，搞好本单位的斗批改，实现、发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    要支持左派，首先自己要是左派；要帮助左派开展革命的大批判，首先自己要做革命大批判的模范。最近一个时期，我们除了经常和革命小将一起进行大批判外，连队的大批判也搞得越来越好。同志们不论在会上发言，或是给墙报、黑板报写稿，矛头都对准中国的赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子王任重。特别是联系到大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的修正主义军事路线时，同志们慷慨激昂，越批劲头越大，决心大破特破资产阶级的军事路线，大树特树毛主席军事路线的绝对权威。
    革命的大批判，促进了全连干部和战士的思想革命化，也提高了我们支左的水平。正因为这样，阶级敌人对革命的大批判怕得要死，恨得要命。他们玩弄陶铸式的反革命两面手法，妄图打乱我们伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，妄图象“五·一六”反革命组织的操纵者一样，破坏和分裂伟大的中国人民解放军。这简直是白日作梦！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，一千个不答应！一万个不答应！永远不答应！
    革命的大批判，还大大地加强了我们的战备观念。我们的眼睛更加雪亮了，对于帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者的阴谋破坏活动，更加百倍警惕。如果他们敢于来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净地把他们消灭掉。我们下定决心，一定要保卫我国无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行，保卫革命的大批判全面开展，保卫毛主席的伟大战略部署全部实现！
