Comrade Xhehu and the entire delegation of the Party and government of Albania, accompanied by Comrade Xie Fuzhi, visited Beijing Normal University this afternoon. They were greeted enthusiastically by several thousand revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards.

Comrade Xhehu and others inspected the big-character posters written by the revolutionary teachers and students of this university during the great criticism movement. They inscribed a message of congratulations for the revolutionary committee, the Red Guards, and the revolutionary teachers and students. The message read: "We congratulate the Red Guards and revolutionary masses on their victories in exposing the capitalist roaders in power, in the struggle for seizing power and the three-in-one combination, and in the great criticism of China's Khrushchev and his cohorts."

This afternoon, the campus of Beijing Normal University was filled with joy. The revolutionary teachers and students and the Red Guards, with hearts full of joy, held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha, waved red flags, sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and formed long lines to welcome the Albanian comrades from the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

Around four o'clock in the afternoon, Comrade Xhehu arrived. The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the national flags of both countries, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Salute to the heroic people of Albania!" The orchestra played the song "We Are True Friends," composed by Albanian comrades based on Chairman Mao's quotations, and the Albanian song "Song of Red Friendship."

The Red Guards held a meeting to welcome the Albanian comrades. At the meeting, filled with the atmosphere of revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two countries, Comrade Xhehu, Comrade Aliya, and Comrade Mero delivered impassioned speeches, wishing that the eternal friendship between the peoples of Albania and China would be as everlasting as the mountains of Albania and as deep as the seas of China. Comrade Tan Houlan, the head of the revolutionary committee of Beijing Normal University, introduced the history and achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Beijing Normal University to the guests.

Then, the Albanian comrades presented a banner symbolizing the combat friendship between the peoples of the two countries to Beijing Normal University. The banner was embroidered with the national emblem of the People's Republic of Albania and the words "Long Live the Eternal Friendship Between Albania and China." The Red Guards were extremely moved and raised their arms, shouting:

"Long live the great teacher, the great leader, the great supreme commander, and the great helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the two countries!" The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University presented the most brilliant contemporary works of Marxism-Leninism, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," to the heroic Albanian comrades. At this moment, the entire audience repeatedly shouted: "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

    新华社二十八日讯　谢胡同志和阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，今天下午由谢富治同志陪同访问了北京师范大学，受到了数千名革命师生和红卫兵小将极为热烈的欢迎。
    谢胡等同志参观了这所大学的革命师生在革命大批判中写的大字报，为校革命委员会、红卫兵和革命师生题词祝贺。题词写道：“我们祝贺红卫兵和革命群众在揭露走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，在夺权和三结合的斗争中，在对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的大批判中所取得的胜利。”
    今天下午，北京师范大学校园内外，喜气洋洋，全校革命师生和红卫兵小将怀着万分喜悦的心情，高举着我们最伟大的领袖毛主席画像和霍查同志画像，举着红旗，唱着《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，排成长长的队伍迎候来自反帝反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚亲人。
    下午四时许，谢胡同志到达，革命师生和红卫兵小将们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和中阿两国国旗，热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！”乐队奏起了由阿尔巴尼亚同志谱曲的毛主席语录歌《我们是真正的朋友》和阿尔巴尼亚歌曲《红色友谊之歌》。
    红卫兵小将为欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友举行了座谈会。谢胡同志、阿利雅同志和梅罗同志，在充满了中阿两国人民战斗团结和革命友谊气氛的座谈会上，发表了热情洋溢的讲话，祝愿阿中两国人民之间永恒的友谊象阿尔巴尼亚的群山一样万古长青，象中国的大海一样无比深厚。北京师范大学革命委员会主任谭厚兰同志向客人们介绍了北师大无产阶级文化大革命的历史和所取得的成就。
    接着，阿尔巴尼亚同志把一面象征中阿两国人民战斗友谊的锦旗献给了北京师范大学。锦旗上绣着阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国徽和“阿中永恒的友谊万岁”的字样。红卫兵小将们万分激动，振臂高呼：
  “伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”“阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中阿两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”北师大的革命师生把当代最光辉的马列主义著作——《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》，献给英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友们。这时，全场不断高呼：“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
