The People's Liberation Army's Tibet Border Defense Forces, in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese government, and in the spirit of maintaining friendship between the peoples of China and India, today in the afternoon, at the Chinese side of the Natu La Pass on the Sino-Indian border, returned the bodies of fourteen Indian soldiers who were killed and abandoned after crossing the Sino-Indian border and launching armed provocations on September 11, along with their personal weapons and ammunition, to the Indian representatives.

The Indian representative, Major Chankra, led a team of thirteen Indian personnel. According to our regulations, they carried the Red Cross flag and arrived at the designated handover location at 2:10 PM (Beijing time). Our border defense forces representative handed over the fourteen bodies of Indian soldiers, twenty-four rifles and submachine guns, and some ammunition to the Indian side on the spot. After Chankra verified and signed the handover list, the list, written in both Chinese and Indian languages, stated: "On September 11, 1967, the Indian military invaded Chinese territory and carried out military provocations, abandoning bodies and military supplies in Chinese territory." At 3:10 PM, the Indian personnel, carrying the bodies of Indian soldiers and weapons and ammunition, withdrew from our territory.

After the Indian reactionaries launched military provocations and invasions against us on September 11 in order to please and seek aid from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, they have been spreading lies out of a guilty conscience, attempting to cover up their crimes of aggression. Indian Defense Minister Swaran Singh claimed that "the aggression was initiated by the Chinese side, and the Indian military was merely defending itself." Now, our border defense forces have returned the abandoned bodies of Indian soldiers and weapons to the Indian side, once again thoroughly exposing the Indian reactionaries' deceitful tricks.

    从维护中印两国人民友好的愿望出发
    我军将入侵印军尸体枪弹全部交还印方
    新华社拉萨十六日电　我人民解放军西藏边防部队，按照我国政府的通知，从维护中印两国人民友好的愿望出发，今天下午，在中锡边界乃堆拉山口我侧，将九月十一日越过中锡边界发动武装挑衅、被我边防部队击毙遗弃的十四具印军尸体和他们随身携带的枪支弹药，全部交给印方代表。
    印方代表钱克拉少校率领十三名印方人员，按照我方规定，打着红十字会的旗子，在下午二时十分（北京时间），来到我方指定的交接地点。我边防部队代表当场将印军尸体十四具、步枪和冲锋枪二十四支以及弹药一部，交给印方。钱克拉一一点收后，在移交清单上签名认领。清单用中印两国文字注明：“在一九六七年九月十一日，印度军队越入中国境内，进行军事挑衅时遗弃在中国境内的尸体及军用物资”。下午三时十分，印方人员，抬着印军尸体和枪支弹药，退出我境。
    印度反动派为着讨好乞援于美帝、苏修，十一日向我发动军事挑衅和侵略以后，作贼心虚，一直散布谎言，企图掩盖其侵略罪责。印度国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格，说什么“侵略行动是中国方面采取的，印度军队只是进行自卫而已”云云。现我边防部队将遗弃在我境内的印军尸体和武器交还给印方，再一次彻底揭穿了印度反动派的骗人伎俩。
