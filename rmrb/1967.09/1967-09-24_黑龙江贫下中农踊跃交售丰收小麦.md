The spring wheat harvest in Heilongjiang Province has been bountiful. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary workers of various state farms in the province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and have eagerly sold or turned in the new wheat. By September 15, the province's wheat procurement task had been completed by about 70 percent. The wheat turned in by various places is equivalent to the total amount of wheat sold last year, more than double the amount received at the same time last year, and the quality is also better than last year's.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with the great revolutionary criticism as the guideline, have been criticizing and denouncing in both words and writing, and have been eliminating the poison spread by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Heilongjiang Province on the grain issue, such as "keeping more, eating more, and selling less." They have put forward the slogan, "In times of plenty, do not forget Chairman Mao, do not forget the Communist Party, do not forget the People's Liberation Army, do not forget the working class, do not forget the state," and with actual actions of sending more and better grain, they have supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supported socialist construction, and supported the world people's revolution.

    黑龙江贫下中农踊跃交售丰收小麦
    春小麦获得大丰收的黑龙江省，广大贫下中农和各国营农场革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者之间的关系，踊跃交售或上缴新麦。截至九月十五日为止，全省小麦征购任务已完成百分之七十左右，各地交售的小麦相当于去年全年小麦的总交售量，比去年同期入库量增加一倍多，质量也比去年好。
    广大贫下中农和革命干部，以革命的大批判为纲，口诛笔伐，肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在黑龙江省的代理人在粮食问题上推行的“多留、多吃、少交售”等的流毒，针锋相对地提出“丰收不忘毛主席，丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘解放军，丰收不忘工人阶级，丰收不忘国家”的口号，以多送粮、送好粮的实际行动，支援无产阶级文化大革命，支援社会主义建设，支援世界人民革命。
