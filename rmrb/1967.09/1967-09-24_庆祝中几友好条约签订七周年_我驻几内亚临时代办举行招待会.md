Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Guinea Hosts Reception

According to Xinhua News Agency, Konakry, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Guinea, Lin Bingnan, hosted a reception on the evening of the 13th in Konakry to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty with Guinean friends.

More than a hundred guests, including Guinea's Minister of Labor and Social Legislation, Barry Sory, Minister of Justice, Sedu Gonte, and Guinean workers who work with Chinese experts, attended the reception.

At the reception, both hosts and guests enthusiastically praised the growing friendship and friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Guinea in their joint struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Many Guinean friends unanimously praised China's aid to Guinea as selfless, stating that China is a sincere and reliable friend in Guinea's struggle against imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence.

Guests eagerly took copies of Chairman Mao's works, the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," large color portraits of Chairman Mao, and Mao badges displayed in the hall. A Guinean friend, upon receiving a portrait of Chairman Mao he had long desired, excitedly said, "On this day of celebrating the common festival of the peoples of China and Guinea, this is the most precious gift from my Chinese friends."

Guinean friends enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao, the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Young official Tomboya said, "Chairman Mao is not only the greatest revolutionary in the world, but also the greatest leader of the world revolution. He is the Lenin of our time. His brilliant thoughts illuminate the path of revolutionary peoples forward." He added, "We should act as Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Only in this way can we become true revolutionaries." Another Guinean youth friend who often listens to Beijing Radio and reads Xinhua News Agency dispatches said, "The new victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have greatly inspired us. We wholeheartedly cheer for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

　　庆祝中几友好条约签订七周年
　　我驻几内亚临时代办举行招待会
    据新华社科纳克里电　中国驻几内亚大使馆临时代办林秉南十三日晚上在科纳克里举行招待会，同几内亚朋友一起热烈庆祝中几友好条约签订七周年。
    几内亚劳工和社会法律部长巴里·索里、司法部长塞杜·贡特以及同中国专家一起工作的几内亚工人一百多位客人，出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，宾主双方热情赞扬几中两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，日益发展的友谊和友好合作关系。很多几内亚朋友一致称赞中国对几内亚的援助是无私的，中国是几内亚反对帝国主义和维护民族独立斗争的真挚、可靠的朋友。
    客人们纷纷索取陈列在大厅中的毛主席著作，红色宝书《毛主席语录》，大幅的毛主席彩色像以及毛主席像章。一位几内亚朋友得到他渴望已久的毛主席像时激动地说：“在欢庆中几两国人民共同节日的今天，这是中国朋友给我的最珍贵的礼物。”
    几内亚朋友们热情颂扬毛主席、颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。青年职员顿博亚说：“毛主席不仅是世界最伟大的革命者，而且是世界革命的最伟大的导师。他是当代的列宁。他的光辉思想象太阳一样照亮了革命人民前进的道路。”他又说：“我们应该按照林彪同志指出的那样去作：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。只有这样，我们才能成为真正的革命者。”另一位经常收听北京广播和阅读新华社新闻稿的几内亚青年朋友说：“兄弟的中国人民在文化大革命中取得的新胜利，给我们很大的鼓舞。我们衷心欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
