The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a crucial juncture. Revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses are all facing new and severe tests. At this moment, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a new call to arms, pointing the way forward for us.

Looking back at the history of revolutionary struggles over the past few decades, whenever the revolution reached a critical point, it was our wise helmsman, Chairman Mao, who showed us the way forward and led the revolution to victory. The practice of the Chinese revolution has taught us an unshakable truth: follow Chairman Mao, and we will always be victorious.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we need to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more than ever, and resolutely and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. We Red Guards are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to his great strategic deployment. We must protect Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment as we protect our own eyes.

A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society, in a desperate attempt to save their dying fate, are trying every means to muddy the waters and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are like flies, seeking out the slightest gaps between the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the great People's Liberation Army, stirring up trouble between the military and the people, and directing their arrows at the great People's Liberation Army. The class enemies are doing this to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and shake the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

However, within our ranks, there are also some people who "cannot see that the enemy is about to be defeated and that we are about to win." They view problems from a bourgeois worldview and therefore cannot see that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is facing an unprecedentedly good situation, and they make various wrong judgments. As a result, they abandon the great criticism, struggle, and reform, and start a "link-up wind." This completely deviates from Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and does a disservice to the proletarian headquarters.

Last year, the Red Guards of the capital went all over the country to spread the revolutionary wind and ignite the revolutionary fire, making their due contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Whatever is in line with Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, we will do it resolutely; whatever deviates from Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, we will resolutely not do it. Today, the hopes of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and the situation of class struggle, require us to make new contributions on new battlefronts. This is: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party from a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, and to do a good job of struggle, criticism, and reform in our own units, and to develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is the extremely glorious historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

The Red Guards of the capital will definitely be models of revolutionary great criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform, and pioneers in smashing the bourgeois headquarters. To better carry out the revolutionary great criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform in our own units, we will resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, requiring all students who are linking up outside to immediately return to Beijing and to their own units, and not to engage in activities in the name of the Revolutionary Committee outside Beijing. In this great battle of criticism, we will take up our pens and fight, showing the new spirit of revolutionary youths, and making the class enemies' dream of restoring capitalism completely shatter.

The Red Guards of the capital will definitely be models of revolutionary great unity. Revolutionary great unity is an inevitable trend of the revolution, which no one can stop. Above all else, there can only be the revolutionary nature of the proletariat, only the interests of the Party and the people, and not the interests of individuals or small groups.

The Red Guards of the capital will definitely be models of stopping armed struggles. Our actions must be unified on the basis of the Party's policies and strategies. We Red Guards will never let a handful of troublemakers who deliberately instigate armed struggles get away with it.

The Red Guards of the capital will definitely be models of supporting the military. The great People's Liberation Army is personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. Such a good army is unparalleled in the world. We Red Guards swear to be the reliable reserve force of the PLA, and resolutely smash the evil plots of a handful of class enemies who direct their arrows at the PLA and attempt to shake and disintegrate the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Red Guards of the capital resolutely support the Party Central Committee's ban on the "May 16 Corps," a counter-revolutionary organization manipulated by a handful of bad leaders, and resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

In the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution, we—Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought—will definitely be clear-headed revolutionaries and not fall for the class enemies' tricks. We will definitely, with the greatest loyalty, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance steadfastly!

　　以最大的忠诚执行伟大的战略部署
　　首都大专院校红代会
    无产阶级文化大革命发展到一个重要关头。无产阶级革命派战士、红卫兵小将和革命群众都面临着新的严峻的考验。就在这个时候，毛主席、党中央向我们发出了新的战斗号召，给我们指明了前进的方向。
    回顾几十年来的革命斗争历史，每当革命发展到一个重要关头，总是我们英明的舵手毛主席给我们指明航向，把革命引向前进。中国革命斗争的实践告诉我们一个颠扑不破的真理：紧跟毛主席，就永远胜利。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们更需要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决地、不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事。我们红卫兵小将无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的伟大战略部署，要象保护眼睛一样保卫毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，为了挽救他们垂死的命运，总是千方百计地企图把水搅浑，使无产阶级文化大革命脱离毛主席的革命路线的轨道。他们象苍蝇一样，寻找无产阶级革命派和伟大的中国人民解放军之间的缝隙，挑拨军民关系，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军。阶级敌人这样做，就是要破坏文化大革命，颠覆无产阶级专政，动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    但是，在我们队伍中，也有一些人，他们“看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质”。他们用资产阶级世界观看问题，因此就看不出当前我国无产阶级文化大革命正面临着空前的大好形势，而作出种种错误的估计。于是就放弃了大批判、斗批改，刮起“串连风”。这就完全背离了毛主席的战略部署，给无产阶级司令部帮了倒忙。
    我们首都红卫兵战士，去年到全国煽革命之风，点革命之火，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了应有的贡献。作为毛主席身边的红卫兵，我们最听毛主席的话，凡是符合毛主席战略部署的事，就坚决地干；凡是背离毛主席战略部署的事，就坚决不干。今天，毛主席、党中央的希望、阶级斗争的形势，要求我们在新的战斗岗位上，作出新的贡献。这就是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命批判的旗帜，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，搞好本单位的斗批改，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。这是毛主席交给我们的极其光荣的历史任务。
    我们首都红卫兵一定做革命的大批判、斗批改的模范，做摧毁资产阶级司令部的先锋。为了更好地搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，我们坚决响应党中央的号召，要求所有在外地串连的同学立即返回北京，返回本单位，更不要随便以红代会的名义在外地活动。我们要在这场大批判的硬仗中，挥笔上阵，杀出革命小将的新威风来，使阶级敌人复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦彻底破灭。
    我们首都红卫兵一定做革命的大联合的模范。革命的大联合，是革命发展的必然趋势，是谁也阻挡不住的。高于一切的，只能是无产阶级的革命性，只能是党和人民的利益，决不是个人的、小团体的派性的利益。
    我们首都红卫兵一定要做制止武斗的模范。我们的行动必须统一在党的政策和策略的基础上。一小撮蓄意挑起武斗的坏家伙，我们红卫兵小将是绝对饶不过他们的。
    我们首都红卫兵一定要做拥军的模范。伟大的中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、是林副主席直接指挥的。这样好的军队，举世无双。我们红卫兵誓做解放军忠实可靠的后备军，坚决粉碎一小撮阶级敌人把矛头指向解放军，企图动摇和瓦解无产阶级专政基石的罪恶阴谋。
    我们首都红卫兵坚决拥护党中央取缔“五·一六兵团”这个被一小撮坏头头操纵的反革命组织，坚决镇压美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右的反革命活动。
    在文化大革命的新高潮中，我们——用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵，一定要做一个清醒的革命者，而不上阶级敌人的当。我们一定要以最大的忠诚，按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地向前进！
