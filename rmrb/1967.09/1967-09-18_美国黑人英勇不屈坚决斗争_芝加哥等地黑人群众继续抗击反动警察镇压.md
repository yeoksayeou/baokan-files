	American black people in Chicago and other places have recently launched armed resistance against oppression.

	On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 300 black youth gathered in front of a middle school in Chicago's black neighborhood to hold a mass meeting, protesting the police's unreasonable harassment of a black female youth. The meeting distributed a large number of leaflets, denouncing the police's atrocities and calling on blacks to rise up and fight. The reactionary municipal authorities sent a large number of police and also mobilized a group of hired thugs to attack the meeting, forcibly arresting people. The brave black youth used bricks and stones as weapons to resist. They smashed police cars and injured many police officers. Black snipers also engaged in a gun battle with the police, dealing a heavy blow to the fascist police.

	On the 15th, a large number of blacks in Richmond, Virginia, held a demonstration and march outside the city jail and threw stones at the jail, strongly protesting the reactionary ruling authorities' persecution of young black leader Brown. The reactionary authorities, in order to intensify the suppression of the black struggle, illegally arrested Brown on the 13th and imprisoned him in the Richmond jail on the 15th. After Brown was arrested, he remained unyielding and continued to study Chairman Mao's quotations while in detention.

	In East St. Louis, Illinois, from the 10th to the 12th, there were three consecutive days of black anti-oppression struggles. During the struggle, blacks held mass meetings and demonstrations, and set fire to police barricades and smashed some stores owned by whites; snipers also fired at the police suppressing the blacks.

    芝加哥等地黑人群众继续抗击反动警察镇压
    新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国第二大城市芝加哥和其他一些地方，最近又爆发了黑人武装抗暴斗争。
    十四日下午，三百多名黑人青年在芝加哥市黑人区一所中学前面，举行群众大会，抗议警察无理迫害一名黑人女青年。会场上散发了大量传单，控诉警察的暴行，号召黑人起来斗争。反动的市当局竟然开去大批警察，还纠集了一批雇佣来的流氓，冲击会场，强行抓人。英勇的黑人青年用砖头、石块作武器，奋起抵抗。他们砸了警车，打伤警察多人。黑人狙击手还同警察展开了枪击战，给了法西斯警察以沉重的打击。
    十五日，弗吉尼亚州里士满市的大批黑人在市监狱外面举行示威游行，并向监狱投掷石头，强烈抗议美国反动统治当局对青年黑人领袖布朗的迫害。反动当局为了加紧镇压黑人的斗争，曾在十三日非法逮捕了布朗，并在十五日把他关进了里士满市的监狱。布朗被捕以后，毫不屈服，并且还在拘留所里抓紧时间学习毛主席语录。
    在伊利诺斯州的东圣路易市，从十日到十二日，一连三天爆发了黑人抗暴斗争。在斗争中，黑人举行群众大会和示威游行，并且放火烧了警察设置的路障，砸了一些白人开设的商店；狙击手还向镇压黑人的警察开枪射击。
