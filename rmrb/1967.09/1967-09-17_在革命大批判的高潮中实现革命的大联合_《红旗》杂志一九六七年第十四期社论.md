The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "Critique of Tao Zhu's Two Books" is a heavy artillery shell aimed at thoroughly smashing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their head. This powerful and forceful call to arms has, throughout the country, promoted the deepening of the revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary criticism is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, a driving force for promoting revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," and for pushing forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. It is a crucial step in carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is better than ever. The most important task at present is to deepen the revolutionary criticism, push forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. The most crucial issue is to achieve revolutionary great unity.

Revolutionary great unity is in the fundamental interests of the proletariat and is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

More than a hundred years ago, when the proletariat first stepped onto the political stage, Marx and Engels issued the great call in the Communist Manifesto: "Workers of the world, unite!"

From the very beginning of leading the Chinese revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has held high the banner of revolutionary great unity, greatly enriching and developing this basic Marxist thought in both theory and practice.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only through the unity of the Communist Party can the unity of the whole class and the whole nation be achieved. Only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can the enemy be defeated and the tasks of the national and democratic revolution be completed." This is true for the democratic revolution, true for the socialist revolution, and true for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as well.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

The working class and all revolutionary factions of the proletariat must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions and set an example in achieving revolutionary great unity.

The working class and all revolutionary factions of the proletariat have a common enemy and a common revolutionary goal. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as their head, are the most ferocious and dangerous enemies of the working class, our mortal foe. We must unite, concentrate our firepower, and focus our targets to carry out revolutionary criticism and push forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various regions and units, so as to thoroughly overthrow them.

In the face of this serious struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the state, what reason do we have not to unite and fight the enemy together? What reason do we have to split into two irreconcilable factions?

Unity is strength. The working class has every reason to unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to achieve revolutionary great unity amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism, and has no reason to cause splits.

Why, then, in some places, does the working class split into two factions and fail to unite? The main reasons are threefold.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of revolutionary great unity. If the working class unites, they will inevitably become isolated and collapse completely. To evade the criticism and struggle of the revolutionary masses, to sabotage the revolution and production, and to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they resort to conspiracies, tricks, incitement, deception, manipulation, and the creation of splits within the working class.

The handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are unwilling to perish. They always resort to various despicable means to incite and create splits, spread poison, and stir up trouble, aiming to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The working class is the most revolutionary class, but it can also be influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies. Due to the infiltration of anarchist, sectarian, and cliquish tendencies, as well as the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies that appear in rightist or ultra-leftist forms such as "doubt everything," the working class has phenomena where petty-bourgeois factionalism replaces proletarian party spirit, hindering revolutionary great unity.

Tracing the roots, the split within the working class into two factions is the evil result of China's Khrushchev's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Only by removing these obstacles can revolutionary great unity be achieved. We must further arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, expose and smash the conspiracies of the class enemies, overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies within our ranks, and achieve revolutionary great unity amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism.

It is worth noting that currently, a handful of counter-revolutionaries, appearing in ultra-leftist guise, are using petty-bourgeois thoughts within our ranks to engage in conspiratorial activities, attempting to sabotage and split the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and to sabotage and split the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the great People's Liberation Army. The organizers and manipulators of the so-called "May 16" group are such a conspiratorial counter-revolutionary group. This counter-revolutionary group must be thoroughly exposed and smashed.

The working class should be the revolutionary faction of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening proletarian party spirit, uniting under Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and not splitting into this faction or that faction, causing factionalism. Factionalism is an expanded form of individualism, for oneself and one's own sect or clique, not for the people, not for the proletariat. Causing factionalism and splits is un-revolutionary and can be exploited by class enemies, leading one astray.

In achieving revolutionary great unity, the working class should look forward, not settle old scores, and engage in more self-criticism. Chairman Mao teaches us: The proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If it cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated. The working class should have such foresight and a broad mind, be good at uniting the vast majority, especially those whose opinions differ from ours, even those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice, to form a surging revolutionary army.

The working class has different levels of awareness, which is an objective phenomenon. This contradiction can be completely resolved through Chairman Mao's policy of unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity, without the need to split into two irreconcilable factions. Revolutionary masses with higher revolutionary consciousness should conduct patient and detailed ideological and political work, helping their class brothers who have been deceived to shake off bourgeois influence, and together advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to victory.

The current high tide of revolutionary criticism will surely promote revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary great unity will in turn promote the deepening of revolutionary criticism, creating good conditions for the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various regions and units. Revolutionary great unity is an urgent need of the current revolutionary situation and the common aspiration of the working class and all revolutionary factions of the proletariat.

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, long live revolutionary great unity!

    在革命大批判的高潮中实现革命的大联合
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十四期社论
    姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》的发表，是彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一颗重型炮弹。这篇雄伟有力的讨敌檄文，在全国范围内，推动了革命大批判的深入开展。
    革命的大批判，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是促进革命大联合和革命“三结合”，搞好各单位斗、批、改的推动力，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重大步骤。
    无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好。当前，最重大的任务是深入开展革命的大批判，推动各单位斗、批、改，最关键的问题是实现革命的大联合。
    革命的大联合，是无产阶级的根本利益，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一个基本原理。
    马克思和恩格斯早在一百多年前，在无产阶级刚刚登上政治舞台的时候，就在《共产党宣言》中发出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的伟大号召。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席从领导中国革命的第一天起，就高举革命大联合的旗帜，在理论上和实践上，极大地丰富和发展了马克思主义的这个基本思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有经过共产党的团结，才能达到全阶级和全民族的团结，只有经过全阶级全民族的团结，才能战胜敌人，完成民族和民主革命的任务。”民主革命是这样，社会主义革命是这样，当前无产阶级文化大革命也是这样。
    毛主席最近指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
    工人阶级和一切无产阶级革命派，要坚决地执行毛主席的这个最新指示，做革命大联合的模范。
    工人阶级和一切无产阶级革命派，有共同的敌人，有共同的革命目标。在无产阶级专政下，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是工人阶级最凶恶、最危险的敌人，是我们的心腹大患。我们只有联合起来，集中火力，集中目标，搞好革命的大批判，搞好各地区和各单位的斗、批、改，才能彻底打倒他们。
    在这场关系到党和国家命运的严重斗争面前，我们有什么理由不联合起来共同对敌？我们有什么理由分成势不两立的两大派组织？
    团结就是力量。工人阶级有一切理由在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下团结起来，在革命大批判的高潮中，实行革命的大联合，而没有任何道理闹分裂。
    现在，有些地方，为什么工人阶级内部分裂成为两派，联合不起来呢？主要有三个方面的原因。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派最害怕革命的大联合。工人阶级联合起来，他们就必然成为孤家寡人，彻底垮台。为了逃避革命群众的批判和斗争，破坏抓革命、促生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，他们耍阴谋，施诡计，挑拨离间，欺骗蒙蔽，操纵利用，制造工人阶级内部的分裂。
    一小撮地富反坏右是不甘心灭亡的。他们总是要施展各种卑劣手段，进行煽动，制造分裂，煽阴风，点鬼火，破坏革命的大联合，妄图达到颠覆无产阶级专政的罪恶目的。
    工人阶级是最革命的阶级，但是，它也会受到资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮的影响。由于社会上的无政府主义、宗派主义、小团体主义以及“怀疑一切”等等以右的或极“左”的形式出现的资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮的侵蚀，在工人阶级内部就出现了以小资产阶级派性代替无产阶级党性的现象，妨碍了革命的大联合。
    追根溯源，工人阶级内部分裂成两派，是中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线遗留下来的恶果。
    只有扫除这些障碍，才能实现革命的大联合。我们必须进一步用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，识破和粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，克服自己队伍中的资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮，在革命大批判的高潮中，实现革命的大联合。
    值得注意的是，当前有一小撮反革命分子，以极“左”的面貌出现，利用我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想，进行阴谋活动，妄图破坏和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，破坏和分裂无产阶级专政的主要支柱——伟大的中国人民解放军。所谓“五·一六”集团的组织者和操纵者，就是这样一个搞阴谋的反革命集团。这个反革命集团必须予以彻底揭露，彻底粉碎。
    工人阶级应该是毛泽东思想的革命派，要增强无产阶级党性，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上联合起来，而不应该分成这个派那个派，闹派性。派性是扩大了的个人主义，是为了自己和自己的宗派小团体，不是为了人民，不是为了无产阶级。闹派性，闹分裂，就是不革命，就可能被阶级敌人所利用，走到邪路上去。
    在实现革命的大联合中，工人阶级要向前看，不要算旧账，多作自我批评。毛主席教导我们：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。工人阶级应该具有这种远见卓识和宽阔胸怀，善于团结绝大多数人，特别是团结那些和自己的意见不同、甚至反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军。
    工人阶级群众中，觉悟不同，是一种客观存在的现象。这种矛盾，完全可以用毛主席团结——批评和自我批评——团结的方针来解决，不需要分成势不两立的两大派。革命觉悟比较高的革命群众，应当进行耐心、细致的思想政治工作，帮助受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄摆脱资产阶级的影响，共同沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    目前正在掀起的革命大批判的高潮，必将促进革命的大联合，而革命的大联合，又必将推动革命大批判的深入开展，为各地区和各单位的斗、批、改创造良好的条件。革命的大联合，是当前革命形势的迫切需要，是工人阶级和一切无产阶级革命派的共同愿望。
    在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下，革命的大联合万岁！
