Title: We Are Resolutely Taking the Socialist Road

We are resolutely taking the socialist road. The Chinese Khrushchev opposes us poor and lower-middle peasants taking the socialist collectivization road, claiming that after liberation, "premature nationalization and collectivization are against the interests of the majority of the people and against progress." This is a smear on our poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered greatly from "individual farming." Take my family for example: after land reform, due to my father's poor health and lack of labor, we faced economic difficulties and had to sell some of our land. Small-scale farming is like a narrow bridge; it can't withstand the slightest disturbance. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "If this situation is allowed to continue, the phenomenon of polarization in the countryside will inevitably become more and more serious day by day." Just at this critical moment, we poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, established cooperatives, and later achieved people's communes. From then on, the collective economy has only gotten better, and we poor and lower-middle peasants have taken the socialist road. The collective economy is good! Even if we encounter great difficulties, we can withstand them. In the second year of establishing the cooperative, I contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized for five months. Due to the care and help from the state and the collective, I recovered from my illness. If this had happened during the time of small-scale farming, not only would the fields have been sold, but I would have had to sit at home waiting to die. It is clear that the collectivization that the Chinese Khrushchev says "goes against the interests of the majority of the people" is complete nonsense. The "majority of the people" he refers to are not us poor and lower-middle peasants, but landlords and rich peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev's words are completely from the standpoint of landlords and rich peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the Chinese Khrushchev opposes us taking the socialist road, the more vigorously we will work for socialism. We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao and take the socialist road for generations to come.

### 社会主义道路我们走定了

　　社会主义道路我们走定了
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对我们贫下中农走社会主义集体化的道路，胡说什么解放后“过早地国有化、集体化是违背大多数人民利益，违背进步的。”这是在我们贫下中农的脸上抹黑。
    过去，我们贫下中农吃够了“单干”的苦头。就拿我家来说，土改以后，由于我父亲身体不好，缺乏劳力，经济困难，只好卖掉了一些地。小农经济真好比独木桥，经不起风吹草动。正如毛主席所指出的：“这种情况如果让它发展下去，农村中向两极分化的现象必然一天一天地严重起来。”就在这紧要关头，我们贫下中农坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，办起了合作社，后来又实现了人民公社化，从此集体经济越办越好，我们贫下中农走上了社会主义的道路。集体经济就是好！就是碰到天大的困难也能顶住。办合作社的第二年，我生了肺病，在医院里住了五个月，由于国家和集体的照顾，帮助我看好了病。这要是在小农经济的时候，不仅田要卖光，人也只好坐在家里等死。可见中国赫鲁晓夫所说的集体化“违背大多数人民利益”，完全是胡说八道。他说的“大多数人”，根本不是我们贫下中农，而是地主、富农。中国赫鲁晓夫这番话，完全是站在地主、富农立场上说的。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫越是反对我们走社会主义道路，我们就越是起劲地干社会主义，我们贫下中农世世代代都要跟着伟大的舵手毛主席走社会主义道路。
