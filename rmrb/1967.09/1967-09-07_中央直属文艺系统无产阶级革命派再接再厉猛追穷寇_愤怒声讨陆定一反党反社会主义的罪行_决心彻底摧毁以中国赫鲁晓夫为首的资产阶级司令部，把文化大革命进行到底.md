The revolutionary faction of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System, advancing bravely in the great criticism movement, recently gathered again to unite in indignation and systematically expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, who has consistently opposed the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the support and direction of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, Lu Dingyi, the counter-revolutionary revisionist, colluded with Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, and Yang Shangkun to fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought for a long time, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The revolutionary arts warriors present cited numerous facts to vehemently denounce Lu Dingyi's outrageous crimes of madly opposing Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary arts warriors of the proletariat said with immense emotion that Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of all the people of China and the world, and Mao Zedong Thought is the sunlight, dew, air, and food, the sole guarantee for the victory of our revolutionary cause. To carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end, we must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi, in order to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism, madly opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed the revolutionary people from grasping Mao Zedong Thought. Today, the revolutionary people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought as their political microscope, telescope, and mirror, have exposed these counter-revolutionaries' true faces under the bright sunlight, thoroughly shattering their dreams of seizing the Party, the army, and the government to restore capitalism!

The revolutionary arts warriors of the proletariat, with unyielding facts, exposed Lu Dingyi's numerous crimes of using his usurped position in the cultural and ideological front to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The speakers pointed out that whenever class struggle intensified and whenever the socialist revolution advanced, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, under the command of his chief backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, would jump out to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resist, and sabotage the socialist revolution. In 1950, he resisted Chairman Mao's directive to criticize the reactionary films "The Last Days of the Dynasty" and "Wu Xun." In 1957, he jumped out again to rehabilitate "Wu Xun." Before the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, Lu Dingyi did everything he could to incite the rightists to attack the Party. Soon after the anti-rightist struggle, he jumped out again to rehabilitate the rightists and express his indignation, openly opposing Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led anti-rightist struggle. During the few years when our country's economy faced temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev, in collusion with domestic and foreign ghosts and snakes, viciously attacked the Three Red Banners, vigorously promoting the revisionist line of "three autonomies and one contract," "three reductions and one elimination," and "three harmonies and one less," attempting to seize the Party and the government and fully restore capitalism. Lu Dingyi, who held the cultural and ideological front for the Chinese Khrushchev, was in perfect harmony with the Chinese Khrushchev, directing his spearhead straight at Chairman Mao. In 1963 and 1964, our great leader Chairman Mao's two important directives on literary and artistic issues sharply pointed out the serious problems in the literary and artistic circles. The Chinese Khrushchev personally took charge, convening a black meeting to resist Chairman Mao's directives. After the meeting, Lu Dingyi immediately donned his armor, collaborating with the black leaders in the literary and artistic and film circles, organizing "new film screenings" and "symposiums," issuing so-called "reports on the new situation in the literary and artistic circles," and conducting fake rectifications and fake criticisms. The revolutionary arts warriors pointed out that under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, Lu Dingyi so madly opposed Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, their goal was to continue to seize the literary and artistic ideological front and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism in China.

The revolutionary arts warriors of the proletariat also focused on exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, who vigorously promoted the theory of "the extinction of class struggle" and advocated and implemented "art for all the people." The speakers pointed out that as early as November 1948, on the eve of national liberation, Lu Dingyi advocated that "films unrelated to politics, as long as they are harmless in propaganda and have artistic value, can be made," and the scope of film scripts' stories "can include those from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, foreign countries, and ancient times," "ancient historical stories can also be selected," without mentioning class struggle or serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In 1956, the Chinese Khrushchev said: "Now our country has been established, class struggle has basically ended, and the most important task for the country in the future is to organize social life." In 1957, Lu Dingyi blatantly said: "Marx's theory of class struggle has become outdated, and the only thing left useful is dialectics." They sang in unison to create a counter-revolutionary theoretical basis for peddling "art for all the people." In 1959, at the National Conference on Cultural Work, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi threw out the so-called "theory of harmless art," further madly promoting the reactionary proposal of "art for all the people." He ranted that "we should not kick out the harmless ones just because we advocate the beneficial ones," and "in the field of literature and art, our experience is that we should not just divide them into good and bad, but into three categories: beneficial, harmless, and harmful." In 1962, Lu Dingyi threw out the poisonous weed "Serving the Broadest Masses of the People," blatantly shouting that literature and art should serve everyone, "even including prisoners in jail." The revolutionary arts warriors said that Lu Dingyi so blatantly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, opposed literature and art serving proletarian politics, his goal was to lead the literary and artistic circles of New China into the quagmire of feudalism and capitalism, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism in China.

The revolutionary faction of the literary and artistic circles pointed out that the crimes committed by Lu Dingyi are heinous and innumerable. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, resolutely fight him down and expose him thoroughly! Completely smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派再接再厉猛追穷寇
　　愤怒声讨陆定一反党反社会主义的罪行
　　决心彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把文化大革命进行到底
    新华社五日讯　在革命的大批判中奋勇前进的中央直属文艺系统的无产阶级革命派，最近再次聚集一堂，同仇敌忾，全面、系统地揭发批判反革命修正主义分子陆定一一贯反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持和指使下，与彭真、罗瑞卿、杨尚昆勾结在一起，长期以来猖狂反对毛泽东思想，妄图推翻无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。到会的革命文艺战士举出大量事实愤怒声讨陆定一疯狂反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。无产阶级革命派文艺战士怀着无比激动的心情说，毛主席是全中国和全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是阳光、雨露、空气和粮食，是我们革命事业胜利的唯一保证。要把中国革命和世界革命进行到底，就必须大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。中国的赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流为了达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，疯狂地反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，反对革命人民掌握毛泽东思想。今天，革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜、望远镜、照妖镜，已经把这些家伙的反革命真面目暴露在光天化日之下，彻底粉碎了他们篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义的美梦！
    无产阶级革命派文艺战士，以无情的事实揭发了陆定一利用他窃踞的文化思想战线上的职权，为复辟资本主义制造舆论的累累罪行。发言的人指出，每当阶级斗争尖锐的时刻，每当社会主义革命向前深入发展一步的时候，反革命修正主义分子陆定一就在他的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫的指挥下跳出来，疯狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，抗拒和破坏社会主义革命。一九五○年，他抗拒毛主席关于批判反动影片《清宫秘史》和《武训传》的批示，一九五七年又跳出来为《武训传》翻案。一九五七年反右斗争前，陆定一千方百计地鼓动右派向党进攻，在反右派斗争后不久，他又跳出来为右派翻案、鸣不平，公开反对毛主席亲自发动和领导的反右派斗争。在我国经济遇到暂时困难的几年，中国赫鲁晓夫与国内外牛鬼蛇神遥相呼应，恶毒地攻击三面红旗，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”、“三降一灭”、“三和一少”的修正主义路线，妄图篡党篡政，全面实行资本主义复辟。为中国赫鲁晓夫把持文化思想阵地的陆定一，更是同中国的赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，把矛头直指毛主席。一九六三年和一九六四年，我们伟大的领袖毛主席关于文艺问题的两次重要批示尖锐地指出了文艺界的严重问题。中国赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，召开黑会，对抗毛主席的批示。会后陆定一立即披挂上阵，伙同文艺界、电影界的黑头目，又搞“新片观摩”“座谈”，又搞所谓“文艺界新气象的报告”，又搞假整风、假批判。革命文艺战士们指出，陆定一在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，如此疯狂反对毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，他们的目的就是为了继续窃踞文艺思想阵地，为在中国复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    无产阶级革命文艺战士，还着重揭发和批判了反革命修正主义分子陆定一大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，宣扬和推行“全民文艺”的反革命罪行。发言者指出，早在一九四八年十一月全国解放前夕，陆定一就鼓吹什么“与政治无关的影片，只要在宣传上无害处，有艺术性上的价值的就可以”，电影剧本故事的范围“可掺合国民党统治区的、外国的、古代的”，“古代历史故事亦可以选择”等等，只字不提阶级斗争，不提为工农兵服务。一九五六年，中国的赫鲁晓夫说：“现在我们的国家已经组成了，阶级斗争基本结束，今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活。”一九五七年，陆定一就明目张胆地说：“马克思的阶级斗争理论已经过时了，剩下还有用处的只是辩证法。”他们一唱一和地为贩卖“全民文艺”制造反革命理论根据。一九五九年，在全国文化工作会议上，反革命修正主义分子陆定一又抛出了所谓“无害文艺论”，进一步疯狂地推行“全民文艺”的反动主张。他胡说什么“不要因为提倡有益的，便把无害的一脚踢开”，“文艺方面的东西，我们的经验是，不要只分好、坏两种，而是分三种，有益的、无害的和有害的”。一九六二年，陆定一抛出大毒草《为最广大的人民群众服务》，赤裸裸地叫嚷文艺要为一切人服务，“甚而至于包括牢里的囚犯”。革命文艺战士们说，陆定一如此明目张胆地反对毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，他的目的就是要把新中国的文艺界引入封建主义、资本主义的泥坑，为在中国推行资本主义鸣锣开道。
    文艺界无产阶级革命派指出，陆定一所犯的罪恶，令人发指，罄竹难书。我们必须发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，坚决把他斗倒、斗臭，批深、批透！彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把文化大革命进行到底！
