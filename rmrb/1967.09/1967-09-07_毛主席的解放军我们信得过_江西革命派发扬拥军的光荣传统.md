In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary mass organizations of Jiangxi Province, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Masses' Great Alliance Preparatory Committee, have inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of supporting the army from the revolutionary base areas. They have enthusiastically assisted and supported the People's Liberation Army, maintained their high prestige, and helped them carry out the "three supports, two militaries" work, thus powerfully promoting the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres in Jiangxi Province will never forget that at the crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was entering the decisive battle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the great leader Chairman Mao dispatched support-left troops. These support-left troops stood firmly on the side of the revolution, held high the banner of revolution, and unambiguously supported the revolutionary mass organizations such as the Jiangxi Provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee," greatly encouraging the broad masses of revolutionary cadres. The revolutionary comrades said: Chairman Mao has sent troops to support us. We must cherish the PLA as we cherish our own eyes, believe in and rely on the PLA. Therefore, wherever the troops went, the organizations affiliated with the "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" formed reception teams, propaganda teams, and reporting groups, enthusiastically and proactively going to the troops' stations to report situations, reflect problems, and propose suggestions for doing a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work. A responsible comrade from a revolutionary organization at the Nanchang Steel Plant, who was hospitalized, rushed back to Nanchang from dozens of miles away upon hearing that the support-left troops had arrived. He told the troops in detail about his personal experiences in the two-line struggle during the Cultural Revolution, greatly helping the troops' support-left work.

The various revolutionary organizations affiliated with the "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "without a people's army, there is no people's everything." They actively maintain the high prestige of the PLA, writing slogans, making decisions, issuing notices, and emphasizing the great significance of supporting the army and loving the people. They also dispatched dozens of propaganda teams to various places to vigorously publicize the good deeds of the PLA in their support-left work, making the broad revolutionary masses deeply understand that the PLA is the great army personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a unique heroic army in the world, the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, and the strongest support for the revolutionary cadres. When a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party incited the deceived masses to direct their attacks at the PLA, the broad revolutionary masses actively exposed and unmasked the enemies' plots, educating the masses to distinguish right from wrong and draw clear lines. The masses declared, "The PLA sent by Chairman Mao, we trust them a thousand times, ten thousand times! We will not fall for the enemies' tricks!"

The revolutionary cadres of the Jiangxi "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" worked tirelessly, day and night, fearlessly, and shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers to undertake patrol, sentry, and guard duties, strictly preventing the sabotage activities of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

The broad revolutionary masses of the Jiangxi "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" love and support the PLA so much that the support-left troops are deeply moved. The soldiers said: The revolutionary masses love and care for the PLA so much. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to believe in and rely on the masses, and do the "three supports, two militaries" work even better.

　　毛主席的解放军我们信得过
    江西革命派发扬拥军的光荣传统
    据新华社南昌五日电　在无产阶级文化大革命中，江西省革命群众组织江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹委会继承和发扬了当年革命根据地人民拥军的光荣传统，满腔热情地帮助和支持人民解放军，维护他们的崇高威信，帮助他们作好“三支”“两军”工作，有力地推动了江西省无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行。
    江西省广大无产阶级革命派最难忘的是，正当无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席派来了支左部队。这些支左部队立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地支持江西省“大联筹”等革命群众组织，给了广大无产阶级革命派极大的鼓舞。革命派的同志们说：毛主席派部队来给我们撑腰，我们一定象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护解放军，相信和依靠解放军。因此，部队所到之处，“大联筹”的所属组织，就组成慰问团、宣传队、汇报组等，满腔热情地主动地来到部队驻地，汇报情况，反映问题，提出作好“三支”“两军”工作的建议。南昌钢铁厂一个革命组织的负责人，正在住医院，听说支左部队来了，从几十里以外赶回南昌，把他在文化大革命中亲身经历的两条路线斗争的情况，原原本本地告诉部队，给部队支左工作以很大帮助。
      “大联筹”所属各革命组织，牢记毛主席“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的教导，积极维护解放军的崇高威信，他们写标语，作决定，出通知，大讲拥军爱民的伟大意义，并派出数十个宣传分队，分赴各地大力宣传人民解放军在支左工作中涌现出来的好人好事，使广大革命群众深刻认识到，人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的，是林副主席亲自指挥的伟大军队，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的，举世无双的英雄军队，是我们无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级革命派最坚强的后盾。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽动受蒙蔽群众把矛头指向解放军时，广大革命群众主动揭露和戳穿阶级敌人的阴谋，教育广大群众明辨是非，划清界限。广大群众表示，毛主席派来的解放军，我们一千个放心，一万个信得过！我们决不上阶级敌人的当！
    江西“大联筹”的无产阶级革命派战士，在协助解放军作好支左工作中，废寝忘食，夜以继日，不畏艰险，同指战员们并肩战斗，共同担负巡逻、放哨、警戒任务，严防党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地富反坏右等反革命破坏活动。
    “大联筹”广大革命群众这样热爱解放军、拥护解放军，使支左部队同志深受感动。指战员们说：革命群众这样热爱和关怀解放军，我们一定按照毛主席相信和依靠群众的教导，把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好。
