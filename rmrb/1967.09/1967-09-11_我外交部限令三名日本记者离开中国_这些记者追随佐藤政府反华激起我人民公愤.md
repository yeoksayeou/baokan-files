	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders Three Japanese Journalists to Leave China
	These Journalists Followed the Sato Government's Anti-China Stance, Provoking Public Outrage

	New China News Agency, September 10th — Today, a responsible official from the News Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned nine Japanese journalists stationed in Beijing. The official announced that three journalists from the Japanese newspapers "Mainichi Shimbun," "Sankei Shimbun," and "Tokyo Shimbun" must leave China within a specified period.

	The official stated that the Sato Cabinet is the most reactionary government in Japan's history. It has consistently followed the policies of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, implementing a reactionary policy of pro-American, pro-Soviet, anti-China, and anti-people. Recently, Sato has gone even further, ignoring the strong opposition of the Chinese people, Japanese people, and Asian people. He personally engaged in collusion with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, blatantly and brutally interfering in China's internal affairs and launching a serious political provocation against the seven hundred million Chinese people.

	The official further pointed out that the aforementioned newspapers and their journalists in Beijing have been actively supporting the reactionary Sato government's anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people activities. Despite our serious warnings, they have repeatedly published articles and cartoons in their newspapers, shamelessly defaming China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, distorting the situation in China, and engaging in anti-China activities. What is particularly intolerable is that they have viciously directed their attacks at the red sun in the hearts of people worldwide, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese people are extremely indignant about this.

	The official stated that their actions have completely violated the spirit of the agreement between the Liaozhengzhi and Takasaki offices for the exchange of journalists, severely damaging the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. Therefore, the News Department announces that effective immediately, the journalist credentials of the aforementioned three newspapers in China are revoked, and they must leave China within the specified period. At the same time, we will not consider the issue of these three newspapers sending new journalists to China for the time being.

    我外交部限令三名日本记者离开中国
    这些记者追随佐藤政府反华激起我人民公愤
    新华社十日讯　我国外交部新闻司负责人今天召见日本驻京的九名记者，正式宣布日本《每日新闻》、《产经新闻》和《东京新闻》三家报社的三名驻京记者，应在限期内离开中国。
    新闻司负责人指出，日本佐藤内阁是日本历届内阁中最反动的内阁。它一贯追随美帝苏修，执行亲美联苏反华反人民的反动政策。最近以来，佐藤更变本加厉，竟不顾中国人民、日本人民和亚洲人民的强烈反对，亲自出马，同中国人民公敌蒋介石集团加紧勾结。这是公然粗暴干涉我国的内政，公然与七亿中国人民为敌的严重的政治挑衅。
    新闻司负责人又指出，上述三家报社和它们的驻京记者一直替反动的佐藤政府反共反华反人民的罪恶勾当摇旗呐喊，甚至不顾我们提出的严重警告，多次在报上刊登通讯和漫画，肆无忌惮地诬蔑我国文化大革命，歪曲报道我国国内的情况，进行反华活动。特别令人不能容忍的是，他们竟然恶毒地把矛头指向全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。中国人民对此表示万分愤慨。
    新闻司负责人指出，他们的这种行动已经完完全全违背了廖承志、高碕两办事处交换记者协议的精神，大大地破坏了中日两国人民间的友好关系。为此，新闻司宣布，自即日起，取消上述三家报社记者在华常驻的资格，限期离开中国。同时，目前我们将不考虑这三家报社派新记者来华的问题。
