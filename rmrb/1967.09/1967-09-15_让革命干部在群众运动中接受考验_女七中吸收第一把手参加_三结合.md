According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 14th, the revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers of Beijing Female Seventh Middle School, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army carrying out military training tasks, actively helped the revolutionary cadre, the former Party branch secretary and school administrator Shen Yan, to stand up and make revolution. They absorbed her into the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ to serve as the director of the school revolutionary committee. This school, with the support of the broad revolutionary masses, has established a leadership core, achieved the resumption of classes and revolution, and brought the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a high tide. The revolutionary great criticism is being carried out vigorously.

Beijing Female Seventh Middle School is a junior middle school with over 1,100 teachers and students, with four leading cadres. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, as soon as they entered the school gate, made them all step aside. They also spread the idea that "the old Beijing Municipal Committee is rotten, and the cadres below are all rotten," inciting the masses to fight against the cadres.

In early March, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who came to carry out military training arrived. The entire school held a debate on whether Shen Yan should participate in military and political training. Initially, five revolutionary students from a revolutionary mass organization posted a big-character poster proposing that Shen Yan should participate in military training. Everyone expressed different opinions regarding this poster. Some thought that Shen Yan's error nature had not been determined, and she should not participate in military training; others, on the contrary, thought that Shen Yan was made into a "monster" by the bourgeois reactionary line, and there was no conclusive evidence to prove she was an enemy, so she should not be deprived of the right to participate in political activities. Just as the debate was heating up, Chairman Mao's instructions on military and political training were transmitted. Chairman Mao taught: "We must also persuade the students to follow Marx's teaching that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself. During military training, do not exclude teachers and cadres who have made mistakes, except for the elderly and the sick. Let these people participate, so as to facilitate their reform." The broad revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically welcomed Chairman Mao's timely instructions. Under the patient guidance of the soldiers and officers, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, analyzed the different opinions of both sides in the debate, and realized that whether to kick out cadres who have made mistakes or to test and give them a chance to reform in the mass movement is a matter of principle concerning whether to implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, whether to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and whether to unite all those who can be united. Revolutionary teachers and students analyzed Shen Yan's situation and believed that to help Shen Yan recognize and correct her mistakes, she must be allowed to participate in the mass movement to accept the test and education of the masses. With the support and encouragement of revolutionary teachers and students, Shen Yan participated in military training.

After Shen Yan participated in military training, some people still had doubts about whether she was a capitalist-roader in power or a revolutionary cadre. Under the support of the soldiers and officers, the broad teachers and students once again launched a debate. Teachers and students, with the spirit of speaking without reservation, exposed Shen Yan's various shortcomings and mistakes, some of which were quite serious. Revolutionary teachers and students, in order to help and educate her, held three small meetings among teachers and three large meetings throughout the school, with Shen Yan making self-criticisms and the broad teachers and students providing criticism and help. Shen Yan made three self-criticisms to the entire school of revolutionary teachers and students. Because her self-criticisms touched the soul, deeply analyzed and criticized her own mistakes and shortcomings, and in the process of self-criticism and criticism drew a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, revolutionary teachers and students warmly welcomed her.

The Cultural Revolution at Beijing Female Seventh Middle School is advancing along the track indicated by Chairman Mao. The conditions for the "three-in-one combination" are relatively mature. Revolutionary teachers and students once again debated whether to combine with Shen Yan. Some said that although Shen Yan is not an anti-Party element, the old Beijing Municipal Committee had implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in Female Seventh Middle School, and Shen Yan was the first-in-command, so they did not agree to combine with her immediately. The majority of teachers and students believed that Shen Yan had implemented the revisionist educational line, which was a mistake. However, from an overall perspective, this was not the main aspect of Shen Yan. Shen Yan's integrity is good; she loves the Party and Chairman Mao. Such a cadre can be combined. They said: We proletarian revolutionaries must implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, enthusiastically help Shen Yan correct her mistakes, and with the spirit of "seizing the day," quickly achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Finally, at a school-wide teachers and students meeting, the vast majority of revolutionary teachers and students welcomed Shen Yan to participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership organ, and after the Revolutionary Committee's Standing Committee's research and decision, she was appointed as the director.

After the proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing Female Seventh Middle School achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," they boldly used revolutionary cadres, greatly enhanced the authority of the Revolutionary Committee, and played its core role, further consolidating the achievements of the "three-in-one combination." In the revolutionary great criticism, the Revolutionary Committee of this school held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, mobilized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," and verbally and in writing, severely criticized the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Since August, the entire school has held seven large criticism meetings, over a hundred small criticism meetings in classes, and big-character posters filled the school. They also opened a special criticism column outside the school. Revolutionary teachers and students are full of fighting spirit, determined to criticize and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the same time, with the help of the soldiers and officers, revolutionary teachers and students continuously use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to break down private thoughts, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to turn Female Seventh Middle School into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    让革命干部在群众运动中接受考验  女七中吸收第一把手参加“三结合”
    据新华社十四日讯  北京女七中革命小将和革命教师，在执行军训任务的人民解放军的协助下，积极帮助革命干部、原党支部书记兼学校行政负责人沈言站起来闹革命，吸收她参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，担任校革命委员会主任。这个学校由于有了广大革命群众支持的领导核心，实现了复课闹革命，活学活用毛主席著作群众运动形成高潮，革命的大批判开展得轰轰烈烈。
    女七中是一个拥有一千一百多名师生的初级中学，共有四个领导干部。文化大革命初期，执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组，一进校门就让他们全部靠边站。并且散布“旧北京市委烂了，下边干部也全烂了”，挑动群众斗争干部。
    三月初，执行军训任务的解放军指战员来了，全校围绕着沈言能不能参加军政训练展开了辩论。起初，一个革命群众组织的五个革命小将，贴出一张大字报，提出应该让沈言参加军训。大家针对着这张大字报提出各种不同看法。有的认为，沈言的错误性质没定，不能参加军训；有的则相反，认为沈言是被资产阶级反动路线打成“牛鬼蛇神”的，到现在没有确凿证据证明她是敌人，不应剥夺她参加政治活动的权利。正在激烈争论的时刻，毛主席有关军政训练问题的指示传达下来了。毛主席教导：“还要说服学生，实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己的教导，在军训时不要排斥犯错误的教师和干部。除老年和生病的以外，要让这些人参加，以利改造。”广大革命师生热烈欢呼毛主席的英明指示是“及时雨”。他们在指战员们耐心帮助下，遵循毛主席的教导，分析了争论双方的不同意见，认识到对犯错误干部是一脚踢开，还是在群众运动中对他们进行考验，给以改过的机会，这是关系到是不是执行毛主席的干部政策，是不是执行毛主席的革命路线，是不是团结一切能够团结的人的原则问题。革命师生分析了沈言的情况，认为要帮助沈言认识错误，改正错误，就必须让她到群众运动中来，接受群众的考验和教育。沈言在革命师生的支持和鼓励下参加了军训。
    在沈言参加军训以后，一些人对沈言究竟是走资本主义道路当权派，还是革命领导干部，抱有疑问。广大师生在指战员们的支持下，又一次展开了鸣放辩论。师生们本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神，揭发出沈言这样或那样的缺点和错误，有的甚至还是比较严重的错误。革命师生为了帮助和教育她，在教师中开了三次小会，全校召开三次大会，由沈言检查，广大师生进行批评帮助。沈言先后向全校革命师生作了三次检查。由于她的检查触及了灵魂，深刻分析批判自己的错误和缺点，并在检查和批判中划清了和资产阶级反动路线的界限，革命师生对她表示热烈欢迎。
    女七中的文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的轨道滚滚向前。革命“三结合”的条件比较成熟了。革命师生又对能不能结合沈言展开了新的辩论。有人说，沈言虽然不是反党分子，但是旧北京市委在女七中推行了反革命修正主义教育路线，沈言是女七中的第一把手，不同意立即结合。大多数师生认为，沈言执行过修正主义教育路线，是有错误的。但是从全面来看，这不是沈言的主流，沈言的大节是好的，是热爱党、热爱毛主席的，对这样的干部可以结合。他们说：我们无产阶级革命派要贯彻毛主席的干部政策，热情地帮助沈言改正错误，以“只争朝夕”的精神，尽快实现革命的“三结合”。最后，在全校师生大会上，绝大多数革命师生欢迎沈言参加革命“三结合”的领导机构，并经过革委会常委研究决定，由她担任了主任委员。
    北京女七中的无产阶级革命派，实现革命“三结合”以后，大胆使用革命干部，大树革委会的权威，发挥了它的核心作用，进一步巩固了“三结合”的成果。在革命的大批判中，这个学校的革委会高举革命的批判大旗，发动群众活学活用毛主席著作，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，口诛笔伐，狠狠批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。八月份以来，全校就开了批判大会七次，班级开的小型批判会一百多次，大字报满校园，并在校外开辟大批判专栏。革命师生斗志昂扬，决心把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭。同时，在指战员的帮助下，革命师生不断用战无不胜的毛泽东思想破私立公，克服各种非无产阶级思想，大树毛泽东思想绝对权威，决心把女七中办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
