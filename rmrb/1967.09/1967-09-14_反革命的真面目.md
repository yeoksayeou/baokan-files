The true face of counter-revolutionaries

China's Khrushchev has always harbored hatred and opposition towards the leadership of the Communist Party. In 1942, when our Party was leading the nation in a heroic struggle against Japanese imperialism, he openly declared, "The Party cannot directly lead mass organizations," and that the Party's role in mass organizations and struggles "can only be to assist, not to lead." At a crucial moment in the decisive battle between two destinies and two futures for our country in 1946, he attempted to abolish our Party's leadership over the people's army, claiming, "The (Party) branches, Party committees, and political committees in our army should be abolished, which means abolishing Party organizations in the army." In 1956, he gritted his teeth and cursed us, saying, "There is now a view that without Party members, one cannot work, as if without Party members, one cannot survive the day." By 1962, in a conversation with foreign guests, he even more brazenly proposed the extremely reactionary fallacy that "revolution does not necessarily require the leadership of the Communist Party."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." The reason China's Khrushchev harbors such hatred and opposition towards the Communist Party and its leadership is not for any other reason but because he has always stood on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, hating and opposing the revolution. He is a thorough and through counter-revolutionary.

    反革命的真面目
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯仇视、反对共产党的领导。在我党领导全国人民英勇抗击日本帝国主义的一九四二年，他就公开叫嚷“党不能直接领导群众团体”，党对群众团体、群众斗争
  “只能帮助，不能领导”。在我国两种命运、两个前途决战的关键时刻——一九四六年，他又妄图取消我党对人民军队的领导，胡说什么“我军的（党）支部、党委会、政治委员会取消，在军队中是取消党的组织”。一九五六年，他咬牙切齿地咒骂我们：“现在有这样一种看法：没有党员就不能工作，似乎没有党员便不可终日”。到了一九六二年，他在一次同外宾的谈话中，更明目张胆地提出“革命不一定要共产党来领导”的极其反动的谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”中国赫鲁晓夫之所以如此仇视共产党，反对共产党的领导，不是因为别的，而是因为他一贯站在反动的资产阶级立场上，仇视革命，反对革命。他是一个彻头彻尾的老反革命。
