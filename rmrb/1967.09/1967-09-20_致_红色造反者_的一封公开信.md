Title: An Open Letter to the "Red Rebels"

We have excerpted and published two big-character posters. These two posters demonstrate the proletarian class's consideration of the bigger picture, understanding of the larger context, and active promotion of revolutionary unity in two exemplary ways: One is to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, abandon small groups, eliminate selfish thoughts, first conduct self-criticism, and proactively admit mistakes, thus creating a good start for the revolutionary unity of the two factions. The other is to actively support all speech and actions that benefit revolutionary unity, acting as a bridge and facilitator for the two opposing factions, promoting revolutionary unity.

This high attitude of striving to be a promoter of revolutionary unity is very worthy of learning.

	An Open Letter to the "Red Rebels"

	Comrades and Fellow Rebels,

	Why have we been fighting "internal wars" for so long without being able to unite? We bear the primary responsibility. In our minds, petty-bourgeois factionalism has overshadowed proletarian party spirit. We emphasize that we are the formidable rebels, emphasizing that our general direction has always been correct, but we cannot timely, boldly, and openly acknowledge the errors and shortcomings, sometimes even serious ones, in our work to our comrades and fellow rebels, resulting in your inability to understand us. At the same time, we have not seen that your general direction since joining the great criticism of the revolution is also correct. Today, we make this public self-criticism here.

	Comrades and Fellow Rebels! The vast majority of comrades in our two organizations are eager to achieve revolutionary unity. A small number of comrades do not yet fully understand the significance of revolutionary unity. We hope they will act as Comrade Lin Biao has said: "Execute the instructions of Chairman Mao that you understand, and also execute those you do not yet understand."

	Comrades and Fellow Rebels! Let us join hands, with the spirit of "seizing the day," quickly unite, and direct our guns at the same target to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev.

### 致“红色造反者”的一封公开信

专栏：革命大字报选

    我们摘要发表了两张大字报。这两张大字报表现了工人阶级顾大局，识大体，积极促进革命大联合的两种高姿态：一种是，克服小资产阶级派性，放弃小山头，排除私心杂念，首先检讨错误，主动进行自我批评，为实现两派革命大联合作出良好的开端。一种是，积极支持一切有利于革命大联合的言论和行动，为对立中的两派搭桥拉线，促进革命大联合。
    这种争当革命大联合的促进派的高姿态，很值得学习。
                                          ——编者
    致“红色造反者”的一封公开信战友们，同志们！
    我们之间为什么长期打“内战”，而久久不能联合呢？我们应负主要责任。在我们头脑里小资产阶级派性高于无产阶级党性。我们强调自己是响当当的造反派，强调自己大方向始终是正确的，而不能向你们——我们的战友和同志，及时地、大胆地、公开地承认我们工作中存在着的，有时甚至是十分严重的错误和缺点，以致造成你们对我们不能谅解的情况。同时，我们没有看到你们投入革命大批判以来的大方向也是正确的。今天，我们在这里向你们公开检讨。
    战友们，同志们！我们两个组织中的绝大多数同志都迫切地要求实现革命的大联合。极少数同志对革命大联合的意义，暂时不够理解。希望他们按照林副主席所说的那样做：对毛主席的指示理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行。
    战友们，同志们！让我们携起手来，以“只争朝夕”的精神，迅速地联合起来，枪口一致，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。		工代会北京无线电联合厂		元件楼行政办公室一·二二革命造反兵团
