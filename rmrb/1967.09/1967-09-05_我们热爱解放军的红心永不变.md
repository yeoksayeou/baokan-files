At the enlarged meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, a responsible comrade from the Party Central Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, issued an important battle order from the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao. We firmly support it, firmly endorse it, and will definitely carry it out!

In more than a year of intense struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army have established a deep bond of friendship. During the days when the capitalist reactionary line was rampant, the great People's Liberation Army, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to the proletarian revolutionary line, most resolutely and powerfully supported us in raising the banner of revolutionary rebellion and engaged in brave and arduous struggles. At the critical moment of the "February 3" seizure of power, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong Provincial Committee, unwilling to accept their defeat, rallied the ghosts and snakes of society, deceived and manipulated some of the masses who were unaware of the truth, and launched a fierce attack on the newly established Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee. At this critical moment, it was the People's Liberation Army that stood up, took a firm stand, and clearly sided with the proletarian revolutionary masses, defending the red political power of Shandong and establishing an immortal merit for the people.

The battle history of the past year shows that in every critical moment, the People's Liberation Army has stood firmly with us. Countless facts have made us deeply realize that without the People's Liberation Army as our strong backbone, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be carried through to the end. As Chairman Mao teaches: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

The great merits of the People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are indelible. We proletarian revolutionaries and the PLA are heart to heart. Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our red hearts for the PLA will never change!

All class enemies are most afraid of the ironclad unity between the military and the people. To save their dying fate, they are trying every means to sow discord and destroy this unity. Their despicable tricks will only backfire.

When the military and the people are united as one, let's see who in the world can defeat us!

　　我们热爱解放军的红心永不变
　　山东红卫兵文艺革命造反司令部
    在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上，党中央负责同志，根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，发出了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的重要战斗号令。我们坚决拥护，坚决支持，坚决照办！
    在一年多的严重斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派和中国人民解放军建立了鱼水相依的战斗友谊。在资产阶级反动路线还十分猖獗的日子里，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于无产阶级革命路线的伟大的中国人民解放军，最坚决、最有力地支持我们高举革命造反的大旗，进行了勇敢、艰苦的斗争。在“二·三”夺权的关键时刻，山东省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，不甘心于他们的失败，纠集了社会上的牛鬼蛇神，蒙蔽和操纵了一部分不明真相的群众，向新生的山东省革命委员会猛扑了过来。在这个关键时刻，又是人民解放军挺身而出，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，捍卫山东红色政权，为人民立下了不朽的功勋。
    一年来的战斗历程表明，在每一个关键时刻，人民解放军都是和我们紧紧地站在一起的。无数事实使我们深深地体会到：没有中国人民解放军作我们强大的后盾，无产阶级文化大革命就不能进行到底。正如毛主席所教导的：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的伟大功勋，是任何人也抹煞不了的。我们无产阶级革命派和解放军心贴着心，就是天作纸，海作墨，也写不尽我们对毛主席亲自缔造和领导、林副统帅亲自指挥的人民军队的无限信赖，无限敬佩，无限热爱的心情。
    海可枯，石可烂，我们热爱解放军的红心永不变！
    一切阶级敌人最怕军民磐石般的团结。他们为了挽救死亡的命运，正在千方百计地挑拨和破坏这种团结。他们的卑鄙伎俩，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌！
