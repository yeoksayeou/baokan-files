Japanese revolutionary workers and progressive friends enthusiastically praise the resounding victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution that has shaken the world, and sing the praises of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

A revolutionary worker from Fukuoka Prefecture's Yabuseki City, Ni no Miya Yoshifumi, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He said, "The great proletarian cultural revolution in China has shaken the world. This great revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionaries in various countries." He said that through the great proletarian cultural revolution, the attempt to restore capitalism in China by the Khrushchev of China will be thoroughly defeated, ensuring that China will never change color, making the world revolutionary base of China even stronger. This is a great support and encouragement to the revolutionary people of all countries. He warmly praised the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to struggle, daring to win, breaking private interests, and thoroughly rebelling for the people's revolution.

This revolutionary worker, who has long been a miner and a truck driver and has suffered much oppression and exploitation from the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, has long been particularly fond of reading Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao warms our hearts like the sun." "Chairman Mao is the greatest genius leader. He believes in the people the most and relies on the people. The people also trust Chairman Mao the most."

Ni no Miya told the reporter that he looks at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in his home every day before and after work, and uses the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to examine his actions of the day. He said, "Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of the laboring people's revolution." This revolutionary worker, who is in an irreconcilable struggle with the Miyamoto faction of the Japanese Communist Party, said that it is Chairman Mao's brilliant works that have given him the wisdom to struggle, and have given him unlimited courage, confidence, and strength. He said, Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in the hearts of revolutionary workers in Japan and the world. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the world will resolutely fight to the end.

Ni no Miya, with the most sincere proletarian feelings, sincerely wishes the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

Professor Noma Kiyoshi of Aichi University highly praised the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao as an unprecedented great innovation of world historical significance. Chairman Mao has added new treasures to the theoretical treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Noma said, after the proletariat seizes power, it must carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution to reach communism.
