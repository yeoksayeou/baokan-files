On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, amidst the joyous celebrations of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by our people, our closest brothers and comrades-in-arms, led by Comrade Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, have arrived in our country for a friendly visit and to participate in the festivities of our people's glorious national day. The entire Chinese people, with hearts filled with boundless excitement, extend the warmest welcome and highest respect to the envoys of the heroic people from the shores of the Adriatic Sea!

China and Albania are separated by vast distances, but the hearts of our two peoples are closely united. Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and in the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism, our two peoples have fought shoulder to shoulder as true friends and comrades. The visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation to our country once again vividly demonstrates the unbreakable fraternal friendship and combat unity based on Marxism-Leninism between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples. This is also a great demonstration against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his congratulatory message last October to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, enthusiastically praised: "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Today, this great beacon of socialism is shining ever more brilliantly across Europe and the world.

Under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great Marxist-Leninist, and the Party of Labour of Albania, the heroic Albanian people have resolutely withstood the counter-revolutionary revisionist tide and smashed the evil plots of international reactionary forces to overthrow the People's Republic of Albania. Facing the encirclement of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, Albania stands like a towering mountain, steadfastly upholding the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the socialist path. The Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people are indeed fearless fighters against imperialism and revisionism, and a strong vanguard of the world proletarian revolution.

The Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people stand at the forefront of the world people's anti-imperialist struggle. They resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism led by the United States, firmly support the just war of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation, firmly support the struggle of the Arab people against aggression, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Albania's role and influence in international affairs are growing, and it enjoys high prestige among the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people have raised the banner of struggle against modern revisionism, engaging in an uncompromising and irreconcilable struggle against Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, the Tito clique, and all kinds of traitors and scabs. They have deeply exposed and criticized the treacherous deeds of modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionists, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, and firmly supported the Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations of various countries, achieving immortal historical merits in the international communist movement.

Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Party of Labour of Albania has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Albania. They have insisted on the dictatorship of the proletariat, carried out class struggle, emphasized proletarian politics, stressed the mass line, and resolutely carried the socialist revolution to the end. Today, the Albanian people have entered the second year of their fourth five-year plan for building socialism. They adhere to the principle of self-reliance, work hard, strive for progress, and have achieved brilliant successes in industry, agriculture, and cultural education, while continuously strengthening their national defense and victoriously defending their socialist motherland.

Currently, under the call of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the entire party and people of Albania are carrying out a vigorous campaign of ideological revolutionization. Whether in coastal cities or mountainous villages, whether in party and government organs or factories and schools, the entire land of the eagles is filled with a new revolutionary atmosphere. The broad masses of the people, armed with Marxism-Leninism, are launching a fierce attack on the ideology of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes. The great campaign of ideological revolutionization of the Albanian people has already achieved significant results. This campaign is of great significance in preventing the restoration of capitalism and enriching the historical experience of the international dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, has, after more than a year of powerful mass movements, achieved a great victory of historic significance. This unprecedented and world-shaking revolution has been warmly praised by the brotherly Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people. Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out: "The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will cleanse China of the Khrushchevs, turning the beautiful dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sets a great example for overthrowing the revisionist cliques in power around the world." The high evaluation given by the Albanian comrades to the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries and the Chinese people.

The friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania was forged by our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is a revolutionary and combat-friendly relationship that has withstood the test of storms and tempests, and is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. As Chairman Mao said: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." As Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out: "No matter what storms and waves come from where, they cannot weaken or damage the unbreakable friendship between our two countries and parties, which is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

Mutual visits between representatives of the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania have become a good tradition. We are confident that this visit by the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu will further strengthen our fraternal unity, deepen our combat friendship, and make new contributions to the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world against imperialism and revisionism.

The great unity of the peoples of China and Albania, the great unity of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples around the world, is invincible. The peoples of China and Albania and the revolutionary peoples of the world will forge ahead, riding the waves of the world revolution!

　　最热烈地欢迎来自阿尔巴尼亚的亲密战友
    在中华人民共和国成立十八周年的节日前夕，在我国人民热烈庆祝无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的欢乐声中，我们最亲密的兄弟和战友，由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，来到我国进行友好访问，并且参加我国人民光辉节日的庆祝活动。全中国人民，怀着无比兴奋的心情，对来自亚得里亚海畔的英雄人民的使者，表示最热烈的欢迎和最崇高的敬意！
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚远隔万里，但是我们两国人民的心是紧紧相连的。我们两国人民是在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，在反帝反修的共同斗争中，并肩战斗的真正的朋友和同志。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团到我国进行友好访问，又一次生动地表现了中阿两党、两国和两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊和马克思列宁主义的战斗团结。这也是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的又一次大示威。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在去年十月给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中热情地赞扬说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”今天，这盏伟大的社会主义明灯，正在向欧洲和全世界放出更加灿烂的光辉。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，坚决顶住了反革命修正主义的逆流，粉碎了国际反革命势力颠覆阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的罪恶阴谋。面对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的重重包围，阿尔巴尼亚象耸入云霄的高山一样，巍然屹立，坚持了马克思列宁主义的革命原则，坚持了无产阶级国际主义，坚持了社会主义道路。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，不愧为反帝反修的大无畏战士，不愧为无产阶级世界革命的一支坚强的突击队。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，站在世界人民反帝斗争的最前列。他们坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义战争，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争，坚决支持亚非拉各国人民的革命斗争。阿尔巴尼亚在国际事务中的作用和影响越来越大，在全世界革命人民中间享有崇高的威望。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反对现代修正主义的战斗旗帜，同赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，同铁托集团和形形色色的叛徒、工贼，进行了针锋相对的不可调和的斗争。他们深刻地揭露和批判了以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义的叛徒行径，捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，并且坚决支持各国马克思列宁主义政党和组织，在国际共产主义运动中建立了不朽的历史功勋。
    以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。他们坚持无产阶级专政，开展阶级斗争，突出无产阶级政治，强调群众路线，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民进入了建设社会主义的第四个五年计划的第二个年头。他们坚持自力更生的方针，艰苦奋斗，奋发图强，在工业、农业和文化教育各个战线上取得了辉煌的成就，并且不断地加强国防力量，胜利地捍卫了自己的社会主义祖国。
    目前，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的号召下，阿尔巴尼亚全党全国正在开展一个轰轰烈烈的思想革命化运动。无论是沿海的城市或山区的乡村，无论是党政机关或工厂学校，整个山鹰之国到处都呈现出一片革命化的新气象。广大的人民群众以马克思列宁主义为思想武器，向资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的意识形态发动猛烈的进攻。阿尔巴尼亚人民的这场伟大的思想革命化运动，已经取得了重大的成就。这个运动，对于防止资本主义复辟具有重大意义，丰富了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，经过一年多气势磅礴的群众运动，取得了具有历史意义的伟大胜利。这场史无前例的、震撼世界的大革命，受到兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的热烈赞扬。霍查同志指出：中国“无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。”阿尔巴尼亚同志给予中国文化大革命的高度评价，是对中国无产阶级革命派和中国人民的极大鼓舞和支持。
    中阿两党和两国人民之间的友谊，是我们伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的，是经历过急风暴雨考验的革命的战斗的友谊，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。正如毛主席所说：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”也正如霍查同志所指出：“不管来自那里的惊涛骇浪和风暴，都不能削弱和损害我们两国和两党建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则钢铁般的基础上的牢不可破的友谊。”
    中阿两党、两国和两国人民的代表之间的互相访问，已经形成了良好的传统。我们深信，这次由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的访问，一定会进一步加强我们兄弟般的团结，增进我们的战斗友谊，并对国际无产阶级和全世界人民反帝反修的革命事业作出新的贡献。
    中阿两国人民的伟大团结，全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的伟大团结，是不可战胜的。中阿两国人民和全世界的革命人民，将在世界革命的大洪流中，乘风破浪，胜利前进！
