Premier Zhou Enlai of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council hosted a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania.

Central leaders, members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and responsible comrades from various sectors, including Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuquan, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Jiang Qing, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Guo Moruo, Zhang Chunqiao, Cheng Benyu, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Dongxing, attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with the moving atmosphere of proletarian internationalist friendship and unity. As Comrade Shehu, Comrade Aliya, and other Albanian comrades entered the banquet hall accompanied by Comrade Zhou Enlai and others, the entire hall erupted in enthusiastic applause. The orchestra played "We Are on the Road."

Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu both delivered important speeches at the banquet.

In his speech (full text on the second page), Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, extended the warmest welcome to the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu. He also paid revolutionary respects to the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people. Comrade Zhou Enlai highly praised the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people for consistently adhering to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, maintaining the dictatorship of the proletariat, and adhering to the policy of "one hand holding a hoe, the other hand holding a gun" and self-reliance. He praised the revolutionary movement in Albania, which has significant theoretical and practical implications for preventing the restoration of capitalism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and has made valuable contributions to enriching the experience of the international dictatorship of the proletariat. He said that the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people have established immortal merits for the international proletarian revolutionary cause and set a brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary peoples around the world.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the Party of Labour of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a glorious and tested Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party. The Albanian people are heroic and great. We feel greatly honored and proud to have such a party and such a people as our closest comrades-in-arms.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved great victories, and the situation is better than ever. Currently, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of the policy of "criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness," a high tide of great criticism, great unity, and the "three-in-one combination" is forming. Hundreds of millions of people are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," further promoting the prosperity and development of our country's industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological progress.

Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, and a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that we are now in a great new era of world revolution. The current international situation is very favorable for Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of all countries. When talking about the Vietnam issue, he strongly condemned that the United States, the Soviet Union, and their followers are plotting to create a new "peace talk" fraud and are brewing for the United Nations to intervene in the Vietnam issue.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that countless facts have proven that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and a great traitor to the international communist movement. All Marxist-Leninists in the world who oppose U.S. imperialism must firmly oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania were formed in the struggle against common enemies, have been tested by the storms of international class struggle, and are truly based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and are eternal and unbreakable. In the future, no matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter in the struggle for common causes, we will always hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, stand together with our Albanian comrades, fight together, and win together.

Comrade Shehu, in his speech at the banquet (full text to be published separately), enthusiastically praised the fraternal fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries. He said that our friendship is great and unbreakable because it is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, because the creators of this friendship are our two parties, our glorious leaders Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Shehu highly evaluated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the historic decision made at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened by Chairman Mao last August, has opened a new stage of great significance in the revolutionary development of the people's China and on the road to socialism and communism. The fundamental significance of the decision of the Eleventh Plenary Session lies in determining, in accordance with the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, the road to be followed to ensure that great socialist China will never change its bright red revolutionary face, and determining the road to be followed by the greatest event since the victory of October 1, 1949—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Party of Labour of Albania and the people of Albania support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and sincerely wish for its victory. This is the will and stance of our people and our party.

When talking about the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Albania, Comrade Shehu said that the people of Albania are united as one, rallying around the Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, and are firmly working and fighting to implement the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour and the grand program for further continuous revolutionization of national life. The movement for further comprehensive revolutionization of national life is advancing successfully.

Comrade Shehu strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists colluding with the Soviet revisionist clique led by Kossygin and Brezhnev to form a counter-revolutionary criminal alliance, attempting to eliminate world socialism, extinguish the flames of liberation struggles of peoples of all countries, and engage in criminal activities to dominate the world by the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. Comrade Shehu said that it is a great fortune for all humanity and the world revolution that the socialist power of the People's Republic of China exists.

Comrade Shehu enthusiastically praised the unbreakable friendship between the peoples, parties, and countries of the two countries. He said that no force in the world can destroy this great friendship. Today, we fight together, and in the future, we will continue to fight together; today, we win together, and in the future, we will continue to win together.

The speeches by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu sparked wave after wave of thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Members of the Tirana "One Hand Holding a Hoe, One Hand Holding a Gun" amateur art troupe, the Albanian news delegation, the delegation of the Writers and Artists Association, the delegation of the Consumer Cooperative, the Tirana volleyball team and shooting team, who are currently visiting our country, as well as other Albanian comrades in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet.

Also in attendance were responsible comrades from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and government departments, responsible comrades from the various headquarters, various military branches, and garrison troops in Beijing, and responsible comrades from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    据新华社二十七日讯　中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，最热烈地欢迎由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。

    宴会上洋溢着无产阶级国际主义友谊和团结的感人气氛。当谢胡同志、阿利雅同志和其他阿尔巴尼亚战友，由周恩来等同志陪同进入宴会厅时，全场响起热烈的掌声。乐队高奏《我们走在大路上》。
    周恩来同志和谢胡同志先后在宴会上发表了极其重要的长篇讲话。
    周恩来同志在讲话（全文见第二版）中首先代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团表示最热烈的欢迎，并向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民，致以战斗的敬意。周恩来同志热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持一手拿镐、一手拿枪、自力更生的方针；赞扬阿尔巴尼亚掀起的革命化运动，对于防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政，具有重大的理论意义和实践意义，为丰富国际无产阶级专政的经验作出了宝贵的贡献。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民为国际无产阶级革命事业建立了不朽的功勋，为全世界马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    周恩来同志说，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是光荣的、久经考验的马克思列宁主义的革命党。阿尔巴尼亚人民是英雄的、伟大的人民。我们有这样的党和这样的人民作为自己最亲密的战友，感到极大的光荣和自豪。
    周恩来同志说，我国无产阶级文化大革命在毛泽东同志的亲自领导下，取得了伟大的胜利，形势空前大好。目前，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，在“批修、斗私”的方针指引下，一个革命大批判、革命大联合、革命“三结合”的高潮正在形成。亿万群众响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”，进一步促进着我国工农业生产和科学技术的繁荣和发展。
    周恩来同志强调说，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。
    周恩来同志说，我们正处在世界革命的一个伟大的新时代。目前的国际形势，对各国马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，是十分有利的。他在谈到越南问题时，强烈谴责美国、苏联和他们的追随者正在策划制造新的“和谈”骗局，并且酝酿由联合国插手越南问题。
    周恩来同志说，无数事实证明，苏修领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是国际共产主义运动的大叛徒。全世界马克思列宁主义者要反对美帝国主义，就必须坚决反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    周恩来同志说，中阿两党、两国和两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结，是在反对共同敌人的斗争中形成的，是经过国际阶级斗争的大风大浪考验的，是真正建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。今后，在为共同事业而进行的斗争中，不论遇到什么样的艰难险阻，我们将永远高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同阿尔巴尼亚战友们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    谢胡同志在宴会上讲话（全文另发），热烈赞扬中阿两国人民之间兄弟般的战斗友谊。他说，我们的友谊是伟大的，是牢不可破的，因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的，因为这一友谊的缔造者是我们两党，是我们的光荣领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志。
    谢胡同志高度评价了中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，去年八月毛泽东主席主持召开的中国共产党十一中全会的历史性决定，在人民中国的革命发展的历史上，在社会主义和共产主义的道路上，开辟了具有特殊意义的新阶段。十一中全会决定的根本意义，在于根据毛泽东同志的思想，马克思列宁主义地确定了保证伟大的社会主义中国永不改变鲜红的革命面貌所应遵循的道路，确定了一九四九年十月一日胜利以来最伟大的事件——无产阶级文化大革命所应遵循的道路。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚全国人民支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，并衷心祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利。这就是我国人民和我们党的意志和立场。
    在谈到阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设时，谢胡同志说，阿尔巴尼亚人民万众一心，团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党周围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，为胜利贯彻劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议和使国家生活进一步不断革命化的宏伟纲领而坚定地进行着劳动和战斗，国家生活的进一步全面革命化运动正在卓有成效地向前发展。
    谢胡同志强烈谴责美帝国主义勾结以柯西金和勃列日涅夫为首的苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，结成反革命罪恶联盟，妄图消灭世界社会主义，扑灭各国人民解放斗争的烈火，由美苏两大国主宰世界的罪恶活动。谢胡同志说，全人类和世界革命感到十分幸运的是，中华人民共和国这个社会主义大国的存在。
    谢胡同志热烈赞颂中阿两国人民、两党和两国之间的牢不可破的友谊。他说，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这个伟大的友谊。今天，我们战斗在一起，今后仍将战斗在一起；今天，我们胜利在一起，今后仍将胜利在一起。
    周恩来同志和谢胡同志的讲话，激起全场一阵又一阵的雷鸣般的热烈掌声。
    正在我国访问的阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”业余艺术团、阿尔巴尼亚新闻代表团、作家艺术家协会代表团、消费合作社代表团、地拉那排球队和射击队的成员，以及在北京的其他阿尔巴尼亚同志，应邀出席了宴会。
