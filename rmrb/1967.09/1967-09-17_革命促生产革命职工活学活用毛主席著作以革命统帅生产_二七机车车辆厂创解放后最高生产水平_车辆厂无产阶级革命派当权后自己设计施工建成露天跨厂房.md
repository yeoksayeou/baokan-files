From Beijing's Changxindian No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, a series of brand-new locomotives and freight cars are rolling on various railway lines. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of this factory with a glorious revolutionary tradition have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Under the armed guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have led production with revolution and promoted production, creating the highest production level since liberation.

The No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory is one of the largest railway factories in China. However, for a long time, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have engaged in collusion and factionalism, seizing control of the entire factory. They have vigorously peddled the black goods of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, fiercely resisting and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. They have promoted material incentives and bonus systems, attempting to lead the enterprise down the capitalist path. Since the start of the Cultural Revolution, they have stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing revolutionary masses and striking at revolutionary cadres. They have also promoted economism, inciting workers to leave their production posts to resist the revolution and sabotage production. At this critical moment, the proletarian revolutionaries, represented by the Red Rebel Corps, seized their power and bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. Over the past half year, they have firmly grasped the overall direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents, launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism, and holding hundreds of large and small criticism and struggle meetings. They thoroughly exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Through criticism and struggle, the class consciousness of the workers has been greatly heightened. More than 80% of the workers in the entire factory have joined the Red Rebel Corps, this revolutionary organization, basically achieving revolutionary great unity. Although there are differences and disputes among the revolutionary mass organizations, they generally follow Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, adopting the method of presenting facts and reasoning to resolve them. The class enemies have tried every means to incite the masses to fight each other, but under the efforts of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, the order within the factory has remained relatively good. The establishment of the new revolutionary order has effectively ensured the normal progress of production.

Under the help of the PLA, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Rolling Stock Factory have decided to turn the factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. They have combined the vigorous promotion of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" with the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, establishing a "daily reading" learning system. The broad revolutionary masses, with deep class feelings, have extensively carried out activities such as "study quotations before class, observe actions during class, and check effectiveness after class," and large-scale reading, discussion, and application of the "Three Old Articles," greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the workers. Many workers say: Grasping revolution and promoting production is not only a production struggle but also a serious political struggle. We must support the revolution with our actual work of improving production. They voluntarily observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, insist on revolutionary activities during their spare time, and exert their boundless enthusiasm to complete the state's production tasks. To improve the process and equipment, the various workshops of the freight car system have universally launched mass technical innovation activities, creating various innovative tools, and exponentially increasing labor productivity. Under the same equipment and manpower conditions, due to the full mobilization of the workers' production enthusiasm, the entire factory has produced more than twenty additional freight cars compared to the same period last year.

The Red Rebel Corps of the No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, to organize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, strengthen revolutionary great unity, and production cooperation, have established revolutionary production joint committees from the bottom up in the locomotive, operation, and manufacturing systems. These committees unify the leadership and deployment of the work of grasping revolution and promoting production in each system. Locomotive production is the key to the entire factory. However, in the past, due to the lack of cooperation and coordination among the relevant workshops, the repair and assembly of locomotives were often affected. Now, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary production joint committee of the locomotive system, the locomotive, wheel, component, and coal-water car workshops, among others, closely cooperate with each other, timely solve problems, and maintain a high production level for locomotives for four consecutive months. Now, the broad revolutionary masses of the entire factory are full of vigor, pursuing each other, and using their outstanding achievements in "grasping revolution and promoting production" to welcome the glorious and great 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

A brand-new, tall, and bright open-air workshop stands on the construction site of the freight car dismantling workshop of Beijing's No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. This high-speed, high-quality, low-cost workshop, built by the factory's construction workshop, is the first major project designed and constructed by the factory's proletarian revolutionaries since they took power.

The workers of this factory's freight car dismantling workshop, under the control of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, have long been working outdoors, seriously affecting production and the health of the workers. Workers have repeatedly suggested building a workshop, but they have been ignored. After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, they actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and decided to build this open-air workshop themselves.

At that time, some people thought that the construction workshop had only been responsible for general repairs within the factory, and the construction of workshops had always been handled by construction companies. Therefore, they lacked confidence in completing this large, technically complex tall building. However, the great Mao Zedong Thought brought them boundless confidence and strength. They took the heroic figure Lü Xiangbi as an example, insisting on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, closely combining the universal truths of Mao Zedong Thought with the current specific work and struggle tasks, turning the study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works into propaganda meetings for spreading Mao Zedong Thought, into struggle meetings for criticizing the capitalist-roaders, and into promotion meetings for grasping revolution and promoting production. Through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses have been significantly heightened.

In the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses carried out activities to recall national sufferings, class sufferings, and the sufferings of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line. Through these activities, they aroused their hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents and turned this hatred into the strength to build the workshop quickly, efficiently, and economically. They have inscribed Chairman Mao's great call to "save money for the revolution" in their hearts and put it into action, saving building materials, cherishing every brick and wood, and reasonably using cement and steel. Therefore, this project has saved more than 90,000 yuan compared to the original plan. Due to the selfless labor of the revolutionary workers and the close cooperation of the relevant parties, this tall open-air workshop with an area of more than 4,500 square meters was completed in less than three months, two months ahead of schedule.

    革命促生产革命职工活学活用毛主席著作以革命统帅生产
    二七机车车辆厂创解放后最高生产水平
    车辆厂无产阶级革命派当权后自己设计施工建成露天跨厂房
    本报讯　从北京长辛店二七机车车辆厂开出的一台台崭新的火车头和货车车辆，奔驰在各条铁路线上。这个具有光荣革命传统的工厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想武装下，以革命来统帅生产，带动生产，机车车辆生产创造解放以来的最高生产水平。
    二七机车车辆厂是我国最大的铁路工厂之一。但是，长期以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，招降纳叛，结党营私，控制了全厂的大权。他们大肆贩卖党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团的黑货，疯狂抵制和反对毛泽东思想，大搞物质刺激、奖金挂帅，妄图把企业引上资本主义邪路。文化大革命开始后，他们顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众，打击革命干部。他们还大搞经济主义，煽动工人离开生产岗位，借以抵制革命，破坏生产。在这紧要关头，以红色造反团为代表的无产阶级革命派夺了他们的权，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。半年多来，他们一直牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头指向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，掀起革命大批判的高潮，举行了上百次的大大小小的批判会、斗争会，彻底揭发、批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。通过批判和斗争，大大提高了职工的阶级觉悟，全厂百分之八十以上的职工参加了红色造反团这个革命组织，基本上实现了革命大联合。群众革命组织之间虽然也存在着意见和争论，但一般都能遵循毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的教导，采取摆事实、讲道理的方法加以解决。阶级敌人曾千方百计挑动群众斗群众，但在无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工的努力下，厂内秩序一直较好。革命新秩序的建立，有力地保证了生产的正常进行。
    车辆厂无产阶级革命派在解放军帮助下，决心把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。他们结合大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，建立起“天天读”的学习制度。广大革命职工带着深厚的阶级感情，广泛开展“班前学语录，班中看行动，班后查实效”和大读、大议、大用“老三篇”的活动，大大促进了职工的思想革命化。许多工人说：抓革命，促生产，不仅是一场生产斗争，也是一场严重的政治斗争。我们一定要用搞好生产的实际行动支持革命。他们自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，坚持业余时间闹革命，发挥冲天干劲，完成国家生产任务。为改进工艺设备，货车系统各车间普遍开展了群众性的技术革新活动，创造了多种革新机具，成倍地提高了劳动生产率。在同样设备和人力条件下，由于充分调动了职工生产积极性，全厂比去年同期多出二十多辆货车。
    二七机车车辆厂的红色造反团，为把广大职工群众的积极性组织起来，加强革命的大联合和生产大协作，在机车、经营、制配等三个系统内，自下而上建立了革命生产联合委员会，统一领导部署各系统抓革命、促生产的工作。机车生产是全厂的重点。但是过去由于有关车间缺乏协作配合，往往影响机车的修理和装配。现在在机车系统革命生产联合委员会的统一领导下，机车、车轮、部件、煤水车等八个车间，相互密切协作，及时解决问题，机车生产连续四个月保持高产水平。现在全厂广大革命职工，意气风发，你追我赶，用“抓革命，促生产”的出色成绩，迎接光辉的、伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    本报讯　一座崭新的、高大明亮的露天跨厂房，矗立在北京二七机车车辆厂货车解体车间的工地上。这座由本厂建筑车间建造的高速度、高质量、低成本厂房，是这个厂无产阶级革命派掌权后自己设计施工的第一项大工程。
    这个厂的货车解体车间职工，过去，在党内走资本主义道路当权派把持下，长期以来在露天中进行作业，严重影响生产和职工身体健康。工人们多次建议修盖厂房，但他们不加理睬。无产阶级革命派掌权后，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，决定自己动手，兴建这座露天跨厂房。
    当时有人认为，建筑车间过去只担负厂内一般的修缮任务，兴建厂房的工程都是由建筑公司搞的。因此，对完成这座面积大、工程技术比较复杂的高大建筑，缺乏信心。但是，伟大的毛泽东思想给他们带来了无穷的信心和力量。他们以英雄人物吕祥璧为榜样，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想的普遍真理和当前具体工作与斗争任务紧密结合起来，把活学活用毛主席著作讲用会变成传播毛泽东思想的宣传会，变成批判走资本主义道路当权派的战斗会变成抓革命、促生产的促进会。通过活学活用毛主席著作，广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和革命热情有了显著的提高。
    在革命的大批判中，广大革命职工开展了忆民族苦、忆阶级苦、忆资产阶级反动路线迫害苦的活动。通过这些活动，激发了大家对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的仇恨，并把仇恨化为多快好省建造厂房的力量。他们把毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，铭刻在心坎上，落实到行动中，节约建筑材料，爱护一砖一木，合理使用水泥、钢材，因此，这项工程投资比原计划节约了九万多元。由于革命职工的忘我劳动和有关方面的密切协作，这座面积达四千五百多平方米的高大露天跨厂房，在不到三个月的时间就胜利完工了，比原计划提前两个月。
