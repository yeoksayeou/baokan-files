The heroic Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, have greatly demonstrated the power of people's war, creating a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialist aggression since the end of World War II.

The 700 million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have become even stronger. They are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

New China News Agency, September 1st: The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Biao, as well as Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai, sent a telegram today to Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other Vietnamese party and government leaders, warmly congratulating the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Hanoi, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Chairman Le Duan of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Premier Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China, extend our warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The heroic Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, have achieved one victory after another in the war of resistance against American aggression, annihilating a large number of American aggressors. The brave struggle of the Vietnamese people has greatly dampened the arrogance of American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by our Vietnamese brothers.

The reason why American imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat in Vietnam is that it is waging a naked war of aggression, while facing the people's war of the Vietnamese people for national liberation. The Vietnamese people, unyielding and courageous, have greatly demonstrated the power of people's war, plunging the American aggressors into a sea of disaster, and creating a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialist aggression since the end of World War II. The victories of the Vietnamese people have proven to the world that American imperialism, this paper tiger, can be thoroughly defeated.

American imperialism has already fallen into the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war. However, it is still making its final desperate struggles. Currently, American imperialism is intensifying its aggression against Vietnam and continuing to play tricks with peace talks, attempting to salvage its failure. Soviet modern revisionism is also intensifying its collusion with American imperialism, trying to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. However, the heroic Vietnamese people are not to be intimidated or deceived. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh has pointed out, the Vietnamese people "are united, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and will resolutely fight to the end for victory." We believe that the Vietnamese people will smash all the enemy's tricks and overcome all difficulties, carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end. Final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people who dare to struggle and dare to win.

The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own. They are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. The 700 million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have become even stronger and more capable of supporting our Vietnamese brothers. The Chinese people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

　　毛主席林副主席周总理热烈电贺越南国庆
    英雄的越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党英明领导下，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝侵略的光辉典范。
    七亿中国人民经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，更加强大，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民抗美救国战争，同越南人民并肩战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    新华社一日讯　中国人民的伟大领袖、中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友、中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志以及国务院总理周恩来同志，今天打电报给越南劳动党中央委员会主席、越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志等越南党政领导人，热烈祝贺越南民主共和国成立二十二周年。电报全文如下：河内越南劳动党中央委员会主席、越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征同志，越南民主共和国政府总理范文同同志：
    在越南民主共和国宣布独立二十二周年的时候，我们代表中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，向越南人民、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府致以最热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，在抗美救国战争中，消灭了美国侵略者大量有生力量，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。越南人民的英勇斗争大灭了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，大长了世界革命人民的志气。中国人民热烈地祝贺兄弟的越南人民所取得的伟大胜利。
      美帝国主义在越南遭到惨败，就是因为他们所进行的是一场赤裸裸的侵略战争；他们所面临的是越南人民争取民族解放的人民战争。越南人民坚强不屈、英勇奋战，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，使美国侵略者陷入灭顶之灾，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的光辉典范。越南人民的胜利向全世界证明，美帝国主义这个外强中干的纸老虎是完全能够被打败的。
    美帝国主义已经陷入越南人民战争的汪洋大海之中。但是，它还要作最后的垂死挣扎。当前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，并且继续玩弄和谈阴谋，妄图挽救它的失败。苏联现代修正主义也在加紧同美帝国主义勾结，力图破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。但是，英雄的越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的。正如胡志明主席所指出的，越南人民“团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”我们相信，越南人民必将粉碎敌人的各种阴谋诡计，克服各种困难，将抗美救国战争进行到底。最后胜利一定属于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的越南人民。
    中国人民一向把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，是更加强大了，更有力量支援兄弟的越南人民。中国人民决心同越南人民并肩战斗在一起，彻底打败美国侵略者。
