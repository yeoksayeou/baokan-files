Just as the revolutionary criticism in Zigong City reached a new high, an important battle order was issued by the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao from the capital. The proletarian revolutionaries of our Yandu are filled with immense joy and enthusiasm, holding rallies and parading day after day. We study repeatedly and discuss time and time again. Our vision is clearer, our hearts are brighter, and our spirits are more vigorous. The proletarian revolutionaries are determined to join all the officers and soldiers of the Zigong City People's Armed Forces Department to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and push the revolutionary criticism in Zigong City and the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units to a more profound new stage. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have come to Zigong City several times, spreading a large amount of capitalist poison in various fields. This account, we must settle thoroughly. This direction of struggle, we revolutionaries must grasp it tightly at all times.

However, at this critical moment of class struggle, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, in collusion with the ghosts and snakes in society and class enemies, take the opportunity to stir up trouble, fish in troubled waters, and plot to shift the direction of the struggle. They point their spears at the proletarian headquarters and the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the People's Liberation Army of China, attempting to shake the proletarian dictatorship to its roots and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. But it is easy to shake the mountains, but difficult to shake the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army of China is an army of the people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the most loyal to Chairman Mao, and the most beloved by the people, invincible under heaven. The People's Liberation Army of China has defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionaries will forever stand together with the heroic People's Liberation Army, sharing the same breath, the same fate, and always maintaining high revolutionary vigilance. Whether it is the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, or the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, as long as they dare to collide with the iron wall of the People's Liberation Army of China, they will be smashed to pieces and meet with utter failure.

Now, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zigong City is excellent. The fields, courtyards, workshops, and docks have all become battlefields for revolutionary criticism. Everyone is criticizing with both mouth and pen, concentrating firepower, with a unified target, determined to criticize deeply and thoroughly, to criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev.

We must respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry out "supporting the military and loving the people" activities, rely on the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and strive to become exemplary supporters of the military. (Accompanying picture)

The Zigong City Military District stands shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the revolutionary leftists, fighting together. This is the comrades from the Military District propagating Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and love the people" in the suburbs of the city.

　　争做拥军模范
　　四川省自贡市无产阶级工人造反司令部、贫下中农革命造反司令部、机关革命造反司令部、红色公安革命造反司令部、毛泽东思想红卫兵代表大会
    正当自贡市的革命大批判进入了一个新高潮的时候，从首都传来了以伟大领袖毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的重要战斗号令。我们盐都的无产阶级革命派无比欢欣鼓舞，连日集会游行。我们一遍又一遍的学习，一次又一次的讨论，我们眼更明，心更亮，劲更足。我们无产阶级革命派决心同自贡市人民武装部全体指战员一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把我们自贡市革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，推向一个更加深入的新阶段。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，曾几次来到自贡市，在各个领域里散播了大量的资本主义毒素，这笔账，我们必须彻底清算。这个斗争大方向，我们革命派每时每刻都要把握得很紧很紧。
    可是，在这阶级斗争关键时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神和阶级敌人，趁机兴妖作怪，混水摸鱼，阴谋转移斗争大方向，把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，指向无产阶级专政的坚强支柱中国人民解放军，妄想从根本上动摇无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。但是，撼山易，撼解放军难。中国人民解放军是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，最忠于毛主席，最受人民爱戴，无敌于天下。中国人民解放军捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，捍卫了无产阶级文化大革命。我们革命派就是永远和英雄的人民解放军团结在一起，同呼吸，共命运，随时提高革命警惕性，管你地富反坏右，管你美帝苏修，只要胆敢撞上中国人民解放军这条钢铁长城，就叫他碰得头破血流，逃不脱彻底失败的命运。
    现在自贡市文化大革命形势大好，田头、院坝、车间、码头，都成了革命的大批判的战场。人人口诛笔伐，火力集中，目标一致，决心把中国的赫鲁晓夫批深批透，批倒批臭。
    我们一定响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，开展“拥军爱民”活动，依靠人民解放军，学习人民解放军，争做拥军模范。（附图片）
