In the course of revolution and construction, the question of relying on which class is, in essence, the key to building what kind of state and following what path. Do you want to establish a state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to build socialism and communism? You can only rely on the working class and all laboring people. Do you want to establish a state under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, to develop capitalism? You can only rely on the bourgeoisie. The question of relying on whom is thus sharply posed before us, and there is no room for ambiguity.

The working class represents the new productive forces of society and is the leading and reliable force of the revolution. It is the core and pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out: "We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class." "The Chinese revolution, if it is not led by the proletariat, will inevitably fail."

However, the Khrushchev of China goes in the opposite direction. After the Chinese working class and revolutionary people, under the leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, seized power with guns, the bourgeoisie attempted to seize the fruits of the revolution. At this time, the biggest power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road openly attacks and insults the working class, saying it is "unreliable," and "do not think that relying on the working class will solve all problems." At the same time, he shamelessly praises the capitalists, saying they "know more about production than workers," and that the working class cannot lead production, "cannot defeat the capitalists," and that if the working class manages factories, "production will be ruined." In his endless "Tianjin Speech," he maliciously depicts the great working class as a "mob" that cannot produce or live without capitalists. This is a perverted and reactionary bourgeois logic that turns black into white!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people have limitless creativity." "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals."

The dictatorship of the proletariat is to have the working class fully and firmly grasp the power of the state in all aspects. The working class is the master of the state and must lead production and is fully capable of leading production. However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road advocates that without capitalists, there is nothing.

To slander the working class and the Communist Party as unable to manage the economy and the state, and to curse that the dictatorship of the proletariat will collapse as a result, is the anti-communist propaganda of imperialism and all reactionaries. The opportunists of the Second International also concocted a traitorous fallacy: using the supposed lack of "sufficient personnel to manage the state" among the working class to oppose the working class seizing power and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin and Stalin refuted this fallacy. Stalin pointed out: "First, seize power, create favorable conditions for the development of the proletariat, and then advance by leaps and bounds." The Khrushchev of China, in tune with imperialism and all reactionaries, changes the face of those hackneyed phrases of the Second International revisionists, which have long been smashed by Lenin and Stalin, and can only expose himself as the spokesperson for imperialism and all reactionaries, and as a faithful disciple of Bernstein and Kautsky.

Chairman Mao says: "We can learn what we did not originally understand. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." This is a great truth that history has proven and will continue to prove. The great Chinese working class and the people of the entire nation, under the wise leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, relying on the great thought of Mao Zedong, working hard and self-reliant, with their own hands, have built a powerful state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and have pushed the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction forward by leaps and bounds, creating unprecedented and unparalleled great achievements. The relentless wheel of history has crushed the Khrushchev of China and his shameless propaganda into dust!

The biggest power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road, in his frenzied cries against relying on the working class, exposes his heinous crime of surrendering to the bourgeoisie. This Khrushchev of China has always dreamed of capitalism, viewing capitalist "democracy," "freedom," capitalist "parliamentary system," capitalist "way of life," and even capitalist exploitation as "self-evident." Therefore, he entrusts the "great task" of "national revival" to the reactionary capitalist Song Qiying and his ilk, wanting to rely on the bourgeoisie to implement bourgeois dictatorship in China. He went to Tianjin to mingle with Song Qiying and a small clique of big bloodsuckers and old parasites, calling each other brothers, pouring out their hearts, and getting along like a house on fire. This clown, who has prostrated himself before the bourgeoisie, in order to please the capitalists and make them smile, shamelessly plots for them and incites them to "struggle" against the working class. Look, the biggest power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road has a clear distinction between love and hate. He has boundless love for the bourgeoisie and deep hatred for the working class, fully exposing his traitorous face of betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    依靠工人阶级捍卫无产阶级专政		南卫东
    在革命和建设中，依靠什么阶级的问题，实质上是建设一个什么国家和走什么道路的关键问题。你要建立无产阶级专政的国家，建设社会主义和共产主义吗？你当然只能依靠工人阶级和全体劳动人民。你要建立资产阶级专政的国家，发展资本主义吗？你当然只能依靠资产阶级。依靠谁的问题，就是这样尖锐地摆在我们面前，一点也含混不得的。
    工人阶级是新的社会生产力的代表者，是革命的领导力量和依靠力量，是无产阶级专政的核心与支柱。
    伟大领袖毛主席明确指出：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。“中国革命如果没有无产阶级的领导，就必然不能胜利。”
    但是中国的赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之。当中国工人阶级、革命人民在伟大统帅毛主席领导下，用枪杆子打下江山以后，资产阶级妄图乘机篡夺革命胜利果实。这时，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就赤膊上阵，攻击、辱骂工人阶级“不可靠”，“不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题。”同时他无耻地吹捧资本家在生产上“比工人知道的多”，胡说工人阶级领导不了生产，“搞不赢资本家”，工人阶级管理工厂“就把生产破坏了”。在他连篇累牍的“天津讲话”中，恶毒地把伟大的工人阶级，描绘成为离开资本家就不能生产、不能生活的“群氓”。真是颠倒黑白，反动透顶的资产阶级混蛋逻辑！
    毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。”
    无产阶级专政就是要由工人阶级全面地、牢固地掌握国家的各方面的大权。工人阶级是国家的主人，必须领导生产，也完全能够领导生产。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却鼓吹没有资本家就没有一切。
    污蔑工人阶级和共产党不能管理经济，不能管理国家，诅咒无产阶级专政会因此而垮台，这是帝国主义和一切反动派的反共谰言。第二国际机会主义者还炮制出一种叛徒谬论：以所谓工人阶级“还没有足够的管理国家的干部”，来反对工人阶级夺取政权和建立无产阶级专政。列宁、斯大林痛斥了这种谬论。斯大林指出：“先夺取政权，为无产阶级的发展造成有利条件，然后一日千里地前进”。中国赫鲁晓夫同帝国主义和一切反动派一个腔调，他改头换面地搬出那些早已被列宁、斯大林粉碎了的第二国际修正主义者的陈词滥调，只能暴露他正是帝国主义和一切反动派的代言人，正是伯恩施坦、考茨基之流的忠实门徒。
    毛主席说：“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”这是历史已经证明了并将继续证明的颠扑不破的伟大真理。伟大的中国工人阶级和全国人民，在我们伟大舵手毛主席的英明领导下，依靠伟大的毛泽东思想，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，用自己的双手，建立了强大的无产阶级专政的国家，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业一日千里地推向前进，创造出史无前例、举世无双的丰功伟绩。无情的历史车轮把中国赫鲁晓夫及其无耻谰言碾得粉碎！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反对依靠工人阶级的疯狂叫嚣，就是他投降资产阶级的滔天罪行的大暴露。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫一向梦寐以求的就是资本主义，什么资本主义的“民主”、“自由”呀，资本主义的“议会制”呀，资本主义的“生活方式”呀，以至资本主义的剥削呀……，在他看来都是“天经地义”的。所以，他把“国家民族之复兴”的“大任”寄托在反动资本家宋棐卿之流的身上，他要依靠资产阶级在中国实行资产阶级专政。他跑到天津同宋棐卿之流一小撮大吸血鬼、老寄生虫鬼混在一起，称兄道弟，倾吐衷肠，打得一团火热。这个拜倒在资产阶级脚下的小丑，为了博得资本家的眉开眼笑，竟然无耻地为他们出谋划策，鼓动他们向工人阶级作“斗争”。看，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派爱憎是何等的分明，他对资产阶级有着无限的爱，对工人阶级有着刻骨的恨，一副背叛无产阶级专政的叛徒嘴脸暴露无遗！
