The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held an extraordinary meeting in mid-August in a liberated area. The permanent representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in the North held a press conference on the evening of the 4th, announcing the extraordinary meeting's communiqué and the political program adopted by the meeting.

The communiqué said that this meeting symbolizes the rapid growth and strengthening of the South Vietnamese people in the seven years since the birth of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, especially after the two major victories in the winter and spring campaigns against the American aggressors. At the meeting, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, made a comprehensive report on the situation and tasks. Huang Jinfa, Vice Chairman and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, read the draft political program of the National Liberation Front. The meeting discussed and adopted the political program of the National Liberation Front.

The communiqué said that since the U.S. imperialists invaded South Vietnam, the heroic people of the South have fought with unparalleled bravery, overcoming numerous difficulties and frustrations, and repeatedly defeating the extremely brutal and vicious plots and means of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, achieving tremendous victories, making more than a hundred thousand U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenaries seriously bogged down and in a predicament. The people of North Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in their struggle against the destructive war of the American aggressors.

The communiqué said that after a long and fierce struggle, the people of South Vietnam have highly developed the people's war, established powerful political and military forces, and are in a position of victory, initiative, and offensive advantage. The people of the South have never achieved such great and comprehensive victories as they have today, and they have never had such favorable conditions as they have today to thoroughly defeat the U.S. invading forces and their lackeys.

The communiqué said that the prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is increasingly enhanced both domestically and internationally. The National Liberation Front has truly become the sole genuine representative of the people of South Vietnam.

The extraordinary meeting of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam warmly praised and commended the merits of various liberation armed forces, and warmly praised the unyielding spirit of unity and struggle of the people of various regions, plains, and cities in the South.

The communiqué pointed out that although the stubborn U.S. imperialists have suffered heavy defeats militarily and politically, they still refuse to abandon their aggressive ambitions. They are strengthening the war in the South and escalating the destructive war against the North, while incessantly clamoring for "peace talks" and staging the farce of "elections for president and parliament" in the South, attempting to deceive public opinion and cover up their war escalation plots.

The communiqué said that the crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the people of various strata in South Vietnam are as high as mountains. The contradictions between the Vietnamese people and U.S. imperialism have never been as profound and sharp as they are now. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are the sworn enemies of the Vietnamese nation.

The communiqué said that the extraordinary meeting of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam unanimously adopted the political program drafted by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front to further expand national unity, further mobilize the entire people and army, strive forward, and achieve a complete victory, building an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then peacefully unifying the country.

The extraordinary meeting of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam called on the liberation armed forces to highly uphold the spirit of revolutionary heroism, continuously develop the offensive, launch larger and more widespread continuous attacks, annihilate, wear down, and disintegrate more U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenaries, vigorously develop guerrilla warfare in all battlefields, continuously attack the enemy's various logistics bases, warehouses, airports, seaports, headquarters, and water and land transportation lines, frustrate the enemy's "sweeping" and "pacification" plans, maintain and expand the liberated areas, protect the people's lives and property, vigorously promote the construction of the three armed forces (main forces, local forces, and guerrilla forces), and meet the huge requirements and tasks of the current stage in a timely manner. The meeting called on the people of the liberated areas to strengthen political and armed struggles, promote production, protect production, improve living conditions, develop health and cultural education, and actively provide manpower and material resources for the anti-American war, consolidating and building a strong liberated area from all aspects. The meeting called on the people of the cities under enemy occupation, as well as patriotic compatriots and religious believers of various nationalities, to further strengthen unity and fight together with the entire people against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The meeting also called on the officers and soldiers of the puppet army and the personnel of the puppet government to recognize the aggressive and traitorous nature of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, abandon darkness for light, and join the people in resisting the Americans and saving the country.

The extraordinary meeting finally said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam represents the 14 million compatriots in the South, determined to vigorously launch an anti-American and national salvation competition with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and the 17 million compatriots in the North, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and gloriously complete the tasks of liberating the South, defending the North, and then unifying the country.

　　越南南方民族解放阵线举行非常会议
　　号召军民克服一切艰难困苦，光荣地完成解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的任务
    新华社河内四日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会八月中旬在解放区某地召开了越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团一日晚举行记者招待会，公布了非常会议公报和会议通过的政治纲领。
    会议公报说，这次会议象征着南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线诞生以来的七年中，尤其是在战胜美国侵略强盗的两个冬春季大捷之后的飞跃成长和壮大。在会议上，民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿作了关于形势和任务的总报告。民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团副主席兼中央委员会总书记黄晋发宣读了民族解放阵线的政治纲领草案。会议讨论和通过了民族解放阵线的政治纲领。

    公报说，经过长期和激烈斗争的越南南方人民，高度发展了人民战争，建立了强有力的政治和武装力量，正处于胜利的、主动的和进攻的优势地位。南方人民从来没有取得过象今天这样巨大和全面的胜利，从来没有具备过象今天这样多的进一步彻底打败美国侵略军及其走狗集团的有利条件。

    会议公报指出，目前，顽固的美帝国主义虽然在军事上和政治上遭到了惨重失败。但是，它仍然不肯放弃侵略野心。它一面加强在南方的战争，加紧对北方的破坏性战争“升级”，一面喋喋不休地叫嚷“和平谈判”和在南方扮演“选举总统、议院”丑剧，妄图欺骗舆论，掩盖其加强战争的阴谋。
    公报说，美帝国主义对越南南方各阶层人民所犯下的罪行比山还高。越南人民同美帝国主义之间的矛盾从没有象现在这样深刻和尖锐。美帝国主义及其走狗，是越南民族的不共戴天的敌人。
    公报说，越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议一致通过由民族解放阵线中央委员会起草的政治纲领，以便进一步扩大民族大团结，进一步大力动员全民全军，努力冲向前去，夺取彻底的胜利，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国。
    越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议号召解放武装力量高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，不断发展主动攻势，发动规模更大、更普遍的连续进攻，消灭、消耗和瓦解更多的美军、伪军和帮凶军，在各个战场上大力发展游击战争，连续袭击敌人的各个后勤基地、仓库、机场、海港、首脑机关和水陆交通线，挫败敌人的“扫荡”和“绥靖”计划，保持和扩大解放区，保护人民的生命财产，大力促进三种武装力量（主力部队、地方部队和游击队）的建军工作，以便及时地满足目前阶段的巨大要求和任务。会议号召解放区人民加强政治斗争和武装斗争，促进生产，保卫生产，改善生活，发展卫生和文化教育事业，踊跃为抗美战争提供人力和物力，从各方面巩固和建设强大的解放区。会议号召敌占区城市人民以及各民族爱国同胞和宗教徒进一步加强团结，同全民一起进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。会议还号召伪军官兵和伪政权人员认清美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和卖国面目，弃暗投明，同人民一起抗美救国。
    非常会议最后说，越南南方民族解放阵线代表一千四百万南方同胞，决心同越南祖国战线和一千七百万北方骨肉同胞大力展开抗美救国竞赛，克服一切艰难困苦，光荣地完成解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的任务。
