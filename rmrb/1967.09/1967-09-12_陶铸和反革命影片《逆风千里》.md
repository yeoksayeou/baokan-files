"Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" is a film that crazily advocates for the counter-revolutionary restoration. Who approved the release of this extremely reactionary, counter-revolutionary film? Who is its main backer? It is the Chinese Khrushchev and Tao Zhu and other top capitalism-roaders within the party.

After the literary script of "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" was published, in the winter of 1961, the counter-revolutionary revisionist and former Film Bureau chief of the Ministry of Culture, Chen Huangmei, went to the Zhujiang Film Studio. He affirmed the film script, saying, "The theme and foundation are good," and that "with a few minor changes, it can be filmed."

In March 1962, with the support of the top capitalist-roader within the party, a so-called National Drama and Opera Creation Conference was held in Guangzhou. At this black meeting, Tao Zhu, as the host and party leader, openly incited the demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles to emerge. "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" was decided as a film project for the Zhujiang Film Studio by Tao Zhu's trusted subordinates according to his instructions during the conference.

During the filming process, this reactionary film faced strong opposition from both inside and outside the studio. Some comrades believed that if the film were made, "Chiang Kai-shek would award it a commemorative medal." The military advisor sent by the army also refused to have the army participate in the filming of scenes that defamed our army and refused to serve as the military advisor for the film. However, the capitalist-roader within the party at the Zhujiang Film Studio paid no heed to these criticisms and refused to consider them, saying, "The film has already started shooting, so let's finish it first." They also put pressure on the masses. However, the masses continued to criticize them severely. Under these circumstances, the filming was forced to stop for a while. Soon, the old Ministry of Culture, under the control of Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and Qi Yanming, issued an order to "resume filming immediately," forcing this poisonous weed to be completed in October 1963.

At the end of 1963, soon after Chairman Mao's instructions on literary and artistic work were issued, Tao Zhu reviewed "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" for the first time and affirmed the film, saying, "The whole play looks pretty good." He also maliciously suggested, "It's just that the victory came too easily. In the confrontation between the enemy and us, our army had no casualties. Were the enemies that incompetent?"

The old Film Bureau and a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party at the Zhujiang Film Studio, following Tao Zhu's black instructions, modified the film and added a scene where a nameless soldier sacrifices himself. After the modification, Tao Zhu reviewed the film for the second time and still felt that it was not perfect. He criticized, "The sacrificed soldier is nameless, and the audience has no impression." He ordered that a relatively important character in the film, our soldier Ji Pengfei, should sacrifice himself in the bridge-blowing scene to leave a deep impression on the audience. After further modification, Tao Zhu finally signed the "pass" with satisfaction.

Tao Zhu's malicious arrangement of Ji Pengfei's sacrifice in the bridge-blowing scene greatly propagandized the revisionist view of the cruelty of war, adding another poisonous arrow aimed at the People's Liberation Army to this reactionary film that erects a monument to Chiang Kai-shek's army. How evil his intentions were!

The film was sent to Beijing, where the counter-revolutionary revisionists Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and Luo Ruiqing reviewed it again and unanimously approved it. Finally, Chen Huangmei issued an order, and the counter-revolutionary film "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" was released.

Soon, a central leader reviewed the film and felt very angry. In his comments on the review opinion of the Guangdong Provincial Cultural Bureau, he sternly pointed out that the film did not expose the ugly face of the reactionaries but instead praised the Nationalist Party's officers as "firm and unyielding, actively fighting," and praised the enemy's army as "undaunted by difficulties, clever and brave." He also pointed out that the film was not meaningful for revolutionary tradition education but had guiding significance for Chiang's spies and saboteurs. He sternly pointed out that the film was "stirring up the anger of the Communist Party and the hearts of the Nationalist Party." He instructed that the film should be stopped from being distributed. Tao Zhu, however, resisted, saying, "The film is not good, but the problem is not that serious; it can still be modified."

Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and others also strongly resisted the criticism of the central leader and, in the name of the old Ministry of Culture Party Group, submitted a report to the central leader, proposing that the film "can be temporarily stopped from being distributed and then distributed after research and modification." The central leader commented on this report, saying, "It is not about stopping distribution but about prohibiting distribution." "The title 'Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles' is reactionary," "This film is for the Nationalist Party's propaganda," "Boosting the morale of the enemy and undermining our prestige." He pointed out sharply, "The reason for writing this thing is not about whether it is true or not, but it is done with ulterior motives."

However, Tao Zhu's evil intentions did not die. He personally went to the Zhujiang Film Studio to stabilize "morale" and resist stubbornly. He told the capitalist-roaders within the party at the studio, "You can modify it a bit! You don't need to make big changes; just add a little to the tail, have the prisoners arrive at the destination, and they will admit defeat. I think it can be modified and distributed!" In June 1964, Chairman Mao criticized the literary and artistic circles again. The old Ministry of Culture, under pressure, once planned to publicly criticize "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles." Seeing that the situation was bad, Tao Zhu played a two-faced trick, instructing the Guangdong Provincial Propaganda Department to write a self-criticism and report it to the old Propaganda Department to get by, while at the same time issuing black instructions to the capitalist-roaders within the party at the studio, saying, "Don't rush to conclude on 'Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles' this film. I think the problem is not that serious. You study it and see if it can be modified.... You propose modification opinions for this film, and it can still be distributed after modification." Until 1965, Tao Zhu personally went to the studio to ask, "Can 'Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles' not be modified?!"

However, all of Tao Zhu's "encouraging" and "bolstering" words were in vain. "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" ultimately could not escape the denunciation and criticism of the revolutionary people, and the backer who supported the emergence of this big poisonous weed, Tao Zhu, also fell from power in the denunciation of the revolutionary masses.

    陶铸和反革命影片《逆风千里》		边切
    《逆风千里》是一部疯狂鼓吹反革命复辟的影片。是谁批准这部极端反动的反革命影片出笼的？它的总后台是谁？就是中国赫鲁晓夫和陶铸等党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    《逆风千里》的文学剧本发表后，即一九六一年冬，反革命修正主义分子、旧文化部电影局长陈荒煤来到珠江电影制片厂，肯定了这个电影剧本，认为“题材、基础都好”，“小改一下就可以拍”。
    一九六二年三月，由党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派支持，在广州开了一个所谓全国话剧歌剧创作会议。在这个黑会上，陶铸以东道主和党的领导者的身份公开煽动文艺界的牛鬼蛇神出笼。《逆风千里》正是陶铸的得力干将根据陶铸的旨意，在会议期间正式决定作为珠江电影制片厂的影片选题。
    在拍摄过程中，这部反动影片不断遭到厂内外群众的激烈反对。有些同志认为这部影片要是拍出来，“蒋介石看了会发给纪念奖章的”。部队派来的军事顾问也拒绝派部队参加拍摄丑化我军的镜头，拒绝担任该片的军事顾问。但珠江电影制片厂党内走资本主义道路的当权派对这些批评却置若罔闻，拒不考虑，竟然说：“片子已经开拍了，就把它拍完再说。”并对群众施加压力。可是群众继续向他们提出严厉的批评。在这种情况下，片子曾一度被迫停止拍摄。不久，在夏衍、陈荒煤、齐燕铭控制下的旧文化部却又发下了“立即恢复拍摄”的命令，强使这株毒草于一九六三年十月拍完。
    一九六三年底，毛主席对文艺工作的批示下达后不久，陶铸第一次审查《逆风千里》，就对这部片子加以肯定，说“整个戏看来还不错”。他还别有用心地提出：“就是胜利得来太容易了。敌我交锋，我军牺牲的一个也没有，难道敌人是那么草包？”
    旧电影局和珠江电影制片厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，根据陶铸的黑指示对这部影片进行修改后，加进了无名战士牺牲的情节。修改后，陶铸第二次审查，还感到“美”中不足。他指责说：“牺牲的战士是个没名没姓的，观众没印象。”并下令要让片中较重要的角色、我军战士纪鹏飞在炸桥中牺牲，以便给观众留下深刻的印象。经过再次修改之后，陶铸才心满意足地签发了“通行证”。
    陶铸恶毒地安排纪鹏飞炸桥牺牲一节，大肆宣扬战争残酷的修正主义观点，使这部为蒋介石军队树碑立传的反动影片，又增添了一支射向中国人民解放军的毒箭，用心何其毒也！
    影片送到北京，反革命修正主义分子夏衍、陈荒煤及罗瑞卿再次审查，一致通过，最后由陈荒煤一纸令下，反革命影片《逆风千里》便破门而出了。
    不久，中央一位领导同志审查了这部影片，感到十分气愤。他在对广东省文化局的审查意见的批语中严厉地指出：这部影片不是揭露反动派丑恶面貌，而是宣扬国民党匪军官“坚强不屈，积极斗争”，是歌颂敌军“不惧困难，机智勇敢”。不是对“革命传统教育有意义的”，而是对蒋匪特务、破坏分子有指导作用。他还严正指出这部影片是“动共产党之愤，动国民党之心。”并指示应停止发行。陶铸却抗拒说：“影片是不好，但问题没那么严重，修改一下还是可以的。”
    夏衍、陈荒煤等对中央领导同志的批评也竭力抗拒，并以旧文化部党组的名义给中央领导同志打报告，提出该片“可暂停发行，等研究修改后再发行”等等。中央领导同志在这个报告上又批示“不是暂停发行，而应该是禁止发行。”“《逆风千里》这个名字就是反动的”，“这部影片是为国民党宣传的”，“长敌人的志气，灭自己的威风”。他一针见血地指出：“为什么写这个东西，根本不是真实不真实的问题，而是别有用心”。
    但是，陶铸贼心不死，又亲自到珠江电影制片厂稳定“军心”，负隅顽抗。他对制片厂党内走资本主义道路的当权派说：“你们可以改一下嘛！不必大改，只把尾巴加一点，把俘虏押到目的地，他们低头认输就可以了嘛！”“我看可以改一改再发行嘛！”
    一九六四年六月，毛主席对文艺界又一次提出严厉的批评。旧文化部迫于形势，一度拟将《逆风千里》拿来公开批判。陶铸看到大势不好，便又耍弄两面派的手法，一方面授意广东省委宣传部写一个检查上报旧中宣部蒙混过关，一方面又向制片厂党内走资本主义道路的当权派发黑指示，说什么：“对《逆风千里》这片子先不要急于下结论，我看问题没有那么严重，你们研究一下，能不能修改。……这部片子你们提出修改意见，改了还是可以发行的。”直到一九六五年，陶铸还亲自跑到制片厂来责问：“《逆风千里》不能改了吗？！”
    但是，陶铸的这一切“鼓气”“壮胆”的话，都是徒劳的。《逆风千里》终究逃脱不了革命人民的声讨、批判，而支持这株大毒草出笼的后台老板陶铸，也在革命群众的讨伐声中倒台了。
