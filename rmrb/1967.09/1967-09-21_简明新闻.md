	The "Defense Agency" director of the reactionary Sato government, Masuda Koji, on the 19th brazenly called for "strengthening" Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" and military bases, blatantly exposing the Japanese reactionaries' increasing efforts to revive Japanese militarism to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism's further expansion of aggression in Asia.

	According to reports, Japan's "Defense Agency" held a high-level meeting of the "Self-Defense Forces" on the 19th to discuss "important issues" facing the "Self-Defense Forces."
