The Bottomless Pit That America Cannot Fill

Helicopters in Short Supply

Due to a shortage of helicopters and pilots, the U.S. Marine Corps in South Vietnam often cannot receive supplies of water and rations, cannot promptly evacuate the dead, and cannot even timely dispatch reinforcements.

The U.S. aggressor forces in South Vietnam possess nearly 2,500 helicopters. Why is there still a helicopter shortage? This is because in the vast ocean of the South Vietnamese people's war, the U.S. aggressors cannot get by for a single day without helicopters. Currently, all heavy weapons, sandbags, hot food, and water supplies for the U.S. invaders in Vietnam, as well as rotations and even trips back to the base for showers, all depend on helicopters for transport. However, under the dense anti-aircraft fire of the South Vietnamese armed forces, U.S. helicopters are the most easily shot down and suffer the greatest losses.

Ship Transport Extremely Tense

The massive consumption of personnel and materials by the U.S. in the South Vietnamese battlefield has already pushed U.S. maritime transport to the brink of being unable to meet the demand. According to a report recently released by the U.S. Senate, the shortage of U.S. ships and crew is causing a "serious transportation situation." It demands that "161 cargo ships be drawn from the idle fleet" to help transport supplies to South Vietnam. Additionally, from May 1966 to February 1967, due to a lack of engineers and deckhands, an average of nine ships per week could not depart from U.S. ports on time.

30 Million Pounds of Copper Exhausted

The massive ammunition consumption by the U.S. in South Vietnam has caused a sharp decline in U.S. copper strategic reserves. The U.S. Department of Defense recently had to issue an emergency order to "use more iron and less copper" in ammunition production.

According to a Pentagon spokesperson, from January 1966 to May of this year, the invading U.S. forces in Vietnam fired approximately 1,500,000 90mm and 155mm artillery shells. Calculating two pounds of copper per shell, the U.S. has consumed a total of 30 million pounds of copper.

Sandbags Cannot Save Lives

The U.S. Supply Command in Saigon recently reported that the cowardly U.S. invaders in Vietnam, fearing attacks by the South Vietnamese armed forces, use 146 million sandbags annually just for constructing defensive fortifications. It is said that so far, 425 million sandbags have been transported for the U.S. troops in Vietnam. If these sandbags were lined up, they would circle the Earth five times.

It is estimated that by June next year, the sandbags used by the invading U.S. forces in Vietnam could build a tower reaching the moon. However, no matter how many sandbags there are, they cannot save lives. The heavy casualties of the invading U.S. forces are setting new records every day.

### 美帝填不满的无底洞

    美帝填不满的无底洞
    直升飞机供应不足
    由于缺乏直升飞机和直升飞机的驾驶人员，在南越战场上的美国海军陆战队常常得不到水和口粮的供应，不能及时运走尸体，甚至连增援部队也不能及时到达。
    美国侵略军在南越拥有近二千五百架的直升飞机，为什么还是发生飞机荒呢？这是因为在南越人民战争的汪洋大海中，美国侵略者离开了直升飞机就一天也混不下去。现在侵越美军在战场上使用的所有重型武器、沙袋、热食、饮水的供应，以及换防、甚至连回营地洗澡，都要依靠直升飞机来运输。而在南越人民武装力量对空射击的密集火网之下，美国的直升飞机又最容易被击落，遭到最大的损失。
    船只运输十分紧张
    美国在南越战场上的巨大人员和物资消耗，已经使美国的海上运输力量，陷入了越来越不足应付需要的地步。据不久前美国参议院发表的一项报告说，美国船只和船员的缺乏，正在造成“严重的运输形势”。它要求
  “从闲置的船队中”抽调一百六十一艘货船去帮助向南越运送供应品。另外，从一九六六年五月到一九六七年二月一日期间，由于缺乏轮机手和舱面人员，每周不能从美国港口按时开出的船只，已达九艘之多。
    三千万磅铜消耗干净
    美国在南越的巨大弹药消耗，已经使美国铜的战略储备剧烈下降。美国国防部最近为此不得不发出制造弹药“多用些铁，少用些铜”的紧急“节约”命令。
    据五角大楼发言人说，从一九六六年一月到今年五月，侵越美军共打了大约一千五百万发九十毫米和一百五十五毫米的炮弹。按一发炮弹耗铜两磅计算，美国总共消耗了三千万磅铜。
    沙袋再多也救不了命
    美国驻西贡补给司令部不久前发表报告说，胆小怕死的侵越美军为了防备南越人民武装的袭击，每年单是为筑构防御工事就要用掉一亿四千六百万只沙袋。据说迄今已经为在南越的美军运去了四亿二千五百万只沙袋。如果把这些沙袋排列起来，其长度可以绕地球五圈。
    据估计，到明年六月为止，侵越美军所用的沙袋将可以用来建造一座通到月球的高塔。但是，沙袋尽管多，仍然救不了命，侵越美军伤亡的惨重，每天都在创造着新的纪录。
