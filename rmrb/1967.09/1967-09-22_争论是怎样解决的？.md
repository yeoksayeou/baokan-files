On the streets and in public places of Bamako, the capital of Mali, it is common to see workers, students, and cadres with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their pockets, with the red cover partially visible. During meetings, on sports fields, or in theaters, one often sees participants and spectators reading this precious book.

Once, a few Malian friends were discussing whether it is possible to rely on aid from imperialism. The debate was intense. One friend quoted Chairman Mao's words: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never hope to achieve their liberation by relying on the 'goodwill' of imperialism and its lackeys. They can only achieve victory by strengthening their unity and persisting in their struggle." Everyone agreed with Chairman Mao's words, and the dispute was resolved.

    争论是怎样解决的？
    在马里首都巴马科的街道上和公共场所，往往可以看到工人、学生和干部口袋里带着《毛主席语录》，语录的红封皮有一部分露在衣袋外面。在集会时、在运动场上或者在剧场里，常常可以看到一些与会者和观众在阅读《毛主席语录》这本宝书。
    有一次，几位马里朋友讨论是否可以依靠帝国主义援助的问题，争论很激烈。一位朋友引用毛主席的语录说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”所有的人都赞同毛主席的话，争论得到了解决。（据新华社讯）
