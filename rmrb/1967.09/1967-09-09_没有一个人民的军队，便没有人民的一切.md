The great proletarian cultural revolution in our country is advancing victoriously under the guidance of Chairman Mao. In the face of the surging waves of the great revolution, the counter-revolutionary clique led by China's Khrushchev has been scattered and is heading towards total collapse.

The great struggle of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past year has once again forcefully proven: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." This is an unshakable great truth.

Class struggle, in essence, is about the question of state power. With state power, the proletariat and the working people have everything. Without state power, everything is lost, and the interests of the people and the future of the nation become illusions. Seizing and consolidating state power is the fundamental task of the proletariat in revolutionary struggle.

Chairman Mao wisely points out: "From the standpoint of Marxism on the state, the army is the chief component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to keep it must have a strong army."

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally created and leads, and Vice Chairman Lin personally commands, the unparalleled People's Liberation Army of China, is the great pillar of our proletarian state power.

It is precisely with the support of this heroic people's army that, under the leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, after more than twenty years of bloody struggle, we smashed the reactionary state machine, seized power, and achieved the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

It is precisely with the support of this heroic people's army, using the gun as a guarantee and relying on the strong dictatorship of the proletariat, that our Party dares to and is able to launch this unprecedented great revolution, thoroughly smash the headquarters of the bourgeoisie hidden within our Party, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend everything for the people.

It is precisely with the support of this heroic people's army that the iron fist of the proletariat has smashed the repeated arrogant provocations of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, safeguarding the victorious progress of our country's great proletarian cultural revolution.

It is precisely with the support of this heroic people's army that the leftist masses have been firmly supported, ensuring the great victory of the "three-in-one combination" power seizure struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

It is precisely with the support of this heroic people's army that industry and agriculture have been greatly supported, promoting the vigorous development of the "grasp revolution, promote production" movement, making the industrial and agricultural fronts present a prosperous scene.

In the heroic struggle of the Chinese people to seize and consolidate state power, the People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits for the people.

The domestic and foreign reactionaries who at every moment attempt to restore capitalism in China have a deep hatred and irreconcilable enmity with our people's army. They want to overthrow our proletarian state power and must inevitably direct their spearheads at the great People's Liberation Army, attempting to shake the pillar of proletarian dictatorship and destroy the blood-and-flesh relationship between the army and the people.

In such a sharp and complex class struggle situation at home and abroad, if there were no People's Liberation Army as the faithful defender of the proletarian state power, no such an impregnable Great Wall, the great proletarian cultural revolution could not be carried out for a single day, and the proletarian state power could not exist for a single day. If vigilance is lost and the Great Wall is "self-destroyed," weakening or even shaking the army of the proletariat, then capitalist restoration could occur at any time. At that time, the system of the state and the relations of production would change, the mountains and rivers would change color, heads would roll, the people would be drowned in a sea of blood, and history would suffer a great setback.

Regarding such a major matter that concerns the interests of the people and the future of the nation, all revolutionary comrades must not be careless or complacent. All revolutionary mass organizations must correctly understand the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, heighten class vigilance a hundredfold, prevent the use by class enemies, prevent the instigation and division by domestic and foreign class enemies, prevent the sabotage of the fighting strength and reputation of the People's Liberation Army by American, Chiang Kai-shek, Soviet revisionist, and Japanese spies and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Loving and supporting the People's Liberation Army is the common task of all revolutionary masses and all patriotic people. True comrades of the proletarian revolution should especially set an example in this regard, fulfill all responsibilities, and assist the People's Liberation Army in completing the glorious and arduous task of defending the nation and the great proletarian cultural revolution.

"Support the army and love the people" is the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army should closely unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launch a new, greater, and more enthusiastic wave of supporting the army and loving the people, so that all domestic and foreign ghosts and monsters will be smashed to pieces in front of the copper wall and iron wall built by our army and people!

　　没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切
　　任立新
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命正在毛主席指引的航道上胜利前进。在大革命怒涛的冲击下，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命阵线已经七零八落，正在走向全面崩溃。
    一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争实践，再一次雄辩地证明了：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是政权问题。有了政权，无产阶级，劳动人民就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切，人民的利益，国家的前途，只能是泡影。夺取政权和巩固政权，这是无产阶级进行革命斗争的根本任务。
    毛主席英明地指出：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，林彪副统帅亲自指挥的举世无双的中国人民解放军，是我们无产阶级国家政权的伟大支柱。
    正是依靠这支英雄的人民军队，在伟大统帅毛主席的率领下，经过二十余年的浴血奋战，我们打碎了反动的国家机器，夺取了政权，获得了中国人民大革命的伟大胜利。
    正是依靠这支英雄的人民军队，以枪杆子作保障，以强大的无产阶级专政作靠山，我们党才敢于和能够发动这场史无前例的大革命，彻底摧毁隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级司令部，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，保卫人民的一切。
    正是依靠这支英雄的人民军队，无产阶级的铁拳粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派一次又一次的猖狂挑衅，保卫着我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。
    正是依靠这支英雄的人民军队，坚决支持左派广大群众，保证了无产阶级革命派“三结合”夺权斗争的伟大胜利。
    正是依靠这支英雄的人民军队，大力支援工农业生产，推动了“抓革命，促生产”运动的蓬勃开展，使工农业战线呈现一片兴旺景象。
    在我国无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权的英勇斗争中，中国人民解放军为人民立下了不朽的功勋。
    每时每刻企图在中国复辟的国内外反动派，与我们的人民军队有着切齿之恨，不共戴天之仇。他们要颠覆我们的无产阶级政权，就必然要把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军，妄图动摇无产阶级专政的擎天柱石，破坏军民血肉相连、鱼水相依的关系。
    在国内外这样极其尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争形势下，如果没有人民解放军作为无产阶级政权的忠实保卫者，没有这样一个坚不可摧的万里长城，无产阶级文化大革命一天也不能进行，无产阶级政权一天也不能存在。如果丧失警惕，“自毁长城”，削弱甚至动摇了无产阶级的军队，那么，资本主义复辟将是随时可能发生的。那时，国家制度和生产关系就会改变，江山变色，人头落地，人民将淹没在血泊中，历史将发生大倒退。
    对于这样关系人民的利益，国家的前途的大事，一切革命同志切切不可粗心大意，掉以轻心。各革命群众组织一定要正确理解无产阶级专政下的大民主，百倍地提高阶级的警惕性，防止阶级敌人利用，防止国内外阶级敌人的挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，严防美蒋、苏修、日本特务和地富反坏右破坏人民解放军的战斗力和声誉。
    爱护人民解放军，拥护人民解放军，这是一切革命群众和一切爱国的人们的共同任务，真正的无产阶级革命派的同志尤应在这方面做出模范，尽一切责任，协助人民解放军完成保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣艰巨的任务。
    “拥军爱民”是我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要部分。无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员，在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下紧密地团结起来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起一个更大规模的热烈的拥军爱民的新高潮，让国内外一切牛鬼蛇神，在我们军民筑成的铜墙铁壁前面碰得头破血流！
