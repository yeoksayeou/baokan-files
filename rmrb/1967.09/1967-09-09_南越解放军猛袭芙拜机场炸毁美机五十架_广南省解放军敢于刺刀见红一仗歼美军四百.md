The South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the Phu Bai American airbase near Hue City to the southwest, destroying more than fifty enemy aircraft, according to an initial count.

At the same time, the Liberation Army also breached the enemy's barbed wire and barracks, launching a fierce assault on the American intelligence and technical center at Phu Bai. After more than an hour of fighting, the Liberation Army destroyed this outpost, annihilating all defending enemy forces, including approximately one hundred and fifty American and puppet spies and officers. The Liberation Army also destroyed all machinery, equipment, and forty vehicles in the center, and burned down an ammunition depot and a fuel depot.

According to a report from Saigon, the brave and skilled Liberation Army of South Vietnam's Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on American troops stationed near the Cu Mgar Valley on the 7th, annihilating four hundred American soldiers.

The report states that the battle was extremely fierce. After a volley of shots, the Liberation Army cleverly maneuvered through the rice fields, infiltrating the enemy's ranks, and engaged in close combat with the invaders, killing and wounding many American aggressors. Under the heavy blows of the Liberation Army, "American helicopters were unable to fly into the battlefield to evacuate the wounded for several hours." The battle raged throughout the night and only ended at dawn on the 8th.

Prior to this, the Liberation Army of this province had twice attacked the city of Cu Mgar on the 2nd and 6th. They launched fierce assaults on the American advisory group, the puppet provincial government, the puppet military headquarters, the puppet police station, the prison, the radio station, and other important enemy strongholds. During the assaults, the Liberation Army charged into the streets and engaged in fierce street battles with the enemy, causing significant casualties and losses.

The guerrilla forces in Thua Thien Province attacked enemy troops stationed near the Upper Le military support zone on August 10th, annihilating an entire company of the Self-Defense Corps and the 7th "Pacification" unit, killing and wounding one hundred and fifty enemy soldiers, and seizing a batch of weapons. The guerrilla forces in the two districts of My Hao and My Thuan in this province, on August 14th, closely coordinated to intercept a sweep of one thousand two hundred puppet soldiers, repulsing the enemy's multiple assaults, and luring the enemy into traps and minefields, annihilating fifty-seven enemy soldiers, including three American "advisors."

The guerrilla forces in the districts of Dien Ban and Vi Thuan in Quang Nam Province launched consecutive attacks and ambushes on the enemy on August 14th and 17th, annihilating an entire platoon of American and puppet soldiers each, and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.
