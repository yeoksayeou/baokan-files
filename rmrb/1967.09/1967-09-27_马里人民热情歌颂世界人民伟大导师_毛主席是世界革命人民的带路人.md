"The Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts." This is the heartfelt expression of the people of Mali when they talk about China or the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

In Mali, Chairman Mao's badges and portraits have become the most precious items. In a teacher's study room, three portraits of Chairman Mao are carefully arranged. This Malian friend said: Chairman Mao has brilliantly inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. He is the great leader of the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world today. Whenever I see his portrait, I am inspired and feel full of strength. I will strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and use it to change our world.

The Chinese songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," have become the favorite songs of many people in Mali. They sing these songs with deep feelings, learning the Chinese pronunciation and singing them everywhere. In a small school in a city 600 kilometers away from Bamako, the students have all learned these two songs. Every day after school, the students form a line and sing their way home. Once, a reporter visited a Malian friend's home, and this friend's aunt, who was over fifty years old, saw the Chinese friend and sang in Chinese, "The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." When the reporter asked who taught her, she replied: Many people in the city know how to sing this song.

There is a 13-year-old Malian child named Fa Jima who drew a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform with a red badge, with a red sun next to Chairman Mao's portrait, and wrote "Long Live Mao Zedong Ten Thousand Times!" Below the portrait. A child in Bamako also drew two portraits of Chairman Mao and gave them to the Chinese Embassy in Mali. In a school, some students drew a portrait of Chairman Mao on the first page of their exercise books, and some even wrote below the portrait: "Long Live the Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander, and Great Helmsman Chairman Mao!"

A Malian youth worker named Bu Diya Bat wrote a poem praising Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, which says:

Chairman Mao! Wherever we go,
We will propagate your brilliant works,
We will spread the truth of your thoughts....
Great Teacher,
The guide of the revolutionary people of all countries.
You belong not only to the Chinese people,
But also to the people of Africa.

　　马里人民热情歌颂世界人民伟大导师
　　毛主席是世界革命人民的带路人
    据新华社讯　“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”。这是马里人民谈到中国或中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的时候，发自内心深处的语言。
    在马里，毛主席的像章和像片成为最珍贵的物品。在一位马里教师的书房里，精心布置了三张毛主席像。这位马里朋友说：毛主席天才地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，他是当代全世界无产阶级和革命人民的伟大领袖。我一看到他的像片，就受到鼓舞，浑身充满了力量。我要努力学习毛泽东思想，用它来改造我们的世界。
    歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的中国歌曲《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》成为许多马里人民最爱唱的歌曲。他们怀着深厚的感情，学会了这两支歌曲的汉语音节，到处唱起来。在离巴马科六百公里的一座城市的一所小学校里，学生们都学会了这两支歌。每天放学时，学生们自己排成队，在大街上一路唱着回家。有一次，记者到一位马里朋友家去访问，这位朋友的一位五十多岁的姑姑一看到中国朋友来了，就用中国话高唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”当记者问她是谁教给她时，她回答说：城里的许多人都会唱这支歌。
    有一位名叫法·吉姆的十三岁的马里儿童，画了一幅身着军装、戴着红领章的毛主席的彩色画像，在毛主席像旁边画了一个红太阳，画像下边写着“毛泽东万万岁！”巴马科还有一位小朋友，画了两幅毛主席像送给中国驻马里大使馆。在一所学校里，有的学生在他们的练习本的第一页上，自己画一幅毛主席像，有的还在像下面写上：“伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”
    一位名叫布·迪亚巴特的马里青年工人写了一首歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想的诗，诗中写道：
    毛主席！我们不管走到那里，
    都要宣传您的光辉的著作，
    都要传播您的思想的真理。……
    伟大的导师，
    各国革命人民的带路人。
    您不仅属于中国人民，
    也属于非洲人民。
