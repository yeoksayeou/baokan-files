Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai, during his activities in the US from the 10th to the 17th, not only engaged in frenzied anti-China rhetoric but also shamelessly peddled Indian national interests, further opening the door for US monopolies to plunder the Indian people.

Desai went to the US at a time when the financial and economic situation of the Indian reactionary government was extremely dire, the domestic political situation was chaotic, and there was an urgent need for more US grain, dollars, and military aid to maintain its rule.

During his stay in the US, Desai held talks with US President Johnson, Secretary of Defense McNamara, Secretary of the Treasury Fowler, Secretary of Agriculture Freeman, and the head of US aid, Gaud. On one hand, he received anti-China directives from his US masters, and on the other, he begged for money, grain, and weapons.

To seal this dirty deal with the US imperialists, Desai sold off Indian national interests at a low price, inviting US monopolies to invest in India.

According to reports, on the 14th, Desai attended a luncheon hosted by the Far East-American Business Council for him, where he met with the chairmen and general managers of the three hundred largest companies and banks in the US. In his speech, Desai once again assured these foreign investors: "India welcomes foreign private investment" and will maintain the tradition of "allowing the full repatriation of profits and capital." Desai assured US capitalists that he would "continue to implement various measures in our tax system to encourage and guarantee Indian and foreign private investment."

Desai's activities were a blatant attempt to lure US monopolies to plunder the Indian people according to their principle of maximizing profits.

In recent years, US imperialism has used so-called "aid" to intensify its infiltration, plunder, and control of India from all angles. The Indian reactionary government, represented by the Congress Party, which is the representative of the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and feudal landlords, has adopted a completely dependent policy on US imperialism, vigorously peddling national interests, making India increasingly a new type of US colony in Asia.

Since 1951, the Indian reactionary government has begged for US "aid" totaling $787 million and 50 million tons of US grain from its US masters, while selling various Indian sovereign rights to the US, allowing US capitalists to set up factories in India and ruthlessly exploit the blood and sweat of the Indian people.

Desai's trip to the US once again proved that the Indian reactionary government is a faithful hound and agent of US imperialism in India.

### 妄想以乞讨美“援”缓和国内政治经济危机　印度财政部长在美国拍卖民族利益

　  妄想以乞讨美“援”缓和国内政治经济危机
　　印度财政部长在美国拍卖民族利益
　  据新华社讯　印度副总理兼财政部长德赛，由十日至十七日在美国活动期间，除了疯狂反华外，还大力拍卖印度民族利益，为美国垄断资本家掠夺印度劳动人民进一步敞开大门。
    德赛是在印度反动政府财政经济极端恶化，国内政局动荡不定，急需更多的美粮、美元来维持它的统治的情况下去美国的。
    德赛在美国期间，和美国总统约翰逊、国防部长麦克纳马拉、财政部长福勒、农业部长弗里曼、美援总负责人高德都举行了会谈。他一手向美国主子领取反华旨意，一手向美国主子要钱、要粮要军火。
    为了要同美帝做成这笔肮脏的交易，德赛还贱价拍卖印度民族利益，招揽美国垄断资本家向印度进行资本输出。
    据报道，德赛在十四日出席远东—美国工商业理事会为他设的午宴会上，会见了美国最大公司和最大银行的三百名董事长和总经理。德赛在讲话中再次向这些外国投资商保证：“印度欢迎外国私人投资”，并将保持毫无限制地“允许把利润和资本全部汇回国的传统”。德赛向美国资本家保证要“继续实行在我国的捐税制度中鼓励和保障印度和外国私人投资的其他许多办法”。
    德赛的这些活动，是最露骨地招揽美国垄断资本家按照他们攫取最大限度利润的原则到印度去放手掠夺印度人民。
    近年来，美帝国主义利用所谓“援助”从各方面加紧对印度的渗透、掠夺和控制。而印度官僚买办资产阶级、封建地主的代表国大党政府，则采取了完全依附美帝，大力拍卖民族利益的反动政策，使印度正在日益沦为美帝在亚洲的新型殖民地。
    自一九五一年到现在，印度反动政府一手向美国主子乞讨了美“援”七十八亿七千多万美元，美粮五千多万吨，一手把印度的种种主权出卖给美帝，让美国资本家到印度设立工厂，残酷地榨取印度人民血汗。
    德赛这次美国之行，又一次证明印度反动政府是美帝国主义在印度的忠实走狗和代理人。
