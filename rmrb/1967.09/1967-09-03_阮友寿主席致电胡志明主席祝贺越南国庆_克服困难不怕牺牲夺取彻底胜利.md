Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho Cables Chairman Ho Chi Minh to Congratulate Vietnam’s National Day
Overcome Difficulties, Fear No Sacrifice, and Achieve Complete Victory

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 2 — According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, on September 1, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam cabled Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the National Assembly, the Government, and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to warmly congratulate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The telegram said: “On the occasion of celebrating the great national festival, the people and liberation armed forces of the South pledge to the 17 million compatriots in the North that, under any circumstances, we will resolutely and perfectly fulfill the sacred mission of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately reunifying the country.”

	The telegram said: “History and the nation have entrusted the people of the South with the task of defeating the U.S. imperialist war of aggression. The South guarantees to resolutely and gloriously complete this historical task.”

	The telegram pointed out that the U.S. aggressors are suffering heavy defeats. The Vietnamese people are achieving great victories in both the South and the North. The new military adventures and extremely barbaric and cunning tactics of U.S. imperialism cannot save it from its desperate and failing situation. The recent heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressors, such as bombing the center of Hanoi, can only arouse greater anger among the military and people of the South, and thus make them more determined to defeat it.

	The telegram finally expressed that the military and people of South Vietnam are determined to thoroughly carry forward the spirit of the August Revolution and the spirit of resolute and thorough revolution. They will overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, unite as one, and resolutely advance to victory. They will continuously attack the enemy in both military and political terms, defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, and achieve complete victory.

　　阮友寿主席致电胡志明主席祝贺越南国庆
　　克服困难不怕牺牲夺取彻底胜利
    新华社河内二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，一日打电报给胡志明主席、越南民主共和国国会、政府和越南祖国战线中央委员会，热烈祝贺越南民主共和国成立二十二周年。
    电报说：“在庆祝民族的伟大节日时，南方人民和解放武装力量向一千七百万北方骨肉同胞保证，不论在任何情况下坚决最圆满地完成解放南方、保卫北方进而统一祖国的神圣任务。”
    电报说：“历史和民族赋予南方人民战胜美帝国主义侵略战争的任务。南方保证坚决和光荣地完成这个历史任务。”
    电报指出，美国强盗正在遭到惨败。越南人民正在祖国南北两方取得巨大胜利。美帝国主义新的军事冒险和极其野蛮和狡猾的手段，决不能挽救它走投无路和失败的窘境。美国强盗最近轰炸河内市中心等的滔天罪行，只能激起南方军民更大的愤怒，从而更坚决地冲上前去打败它。
    电报最后表示，越南南方军民决心彻底发扬八月革命和坚决彻底革命的精神，克服一切困难，不怕牺牲，团结一致，坚决乘胜前进，在军事和政治上连续进攻敌人，打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，夺取彻底的胜利。
