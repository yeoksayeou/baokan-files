The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to victory for revolutionary people around the world. Through their own revolutionary struggles, the broad revolutionary masses of the world are increasingly recognizing that "studying Chairman Mao's works and following the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao" is the only correct and bright road to victory.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had a tremendous impact on the world. An African friend said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China is advancing from one victory to another. China is a model of courage, confidence, and determination for us African people." A reader from Congo (Leopoldville) wrote to say that in the past, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, overthrew the "three big mountains." Today, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they have become a powerful force against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. We, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can eliminate both old and new colonialism.

For this reason, in the more than a year since the start of the Cultural Revolution, the number of Chairman Mao's works published abroad has exceeded the total for the previous fourteen years. Especially, in less than a year since the formal publication abroad of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," the number of copies issued has reached more than 1.3 million, distributed in 128 countries and regions around the world. In addition, in the past year, sixteen countries have published translations of Chairman Mao's works in their own languages. In dozens of countries, many revolutionary groups have organized special study groups to systematically study Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world.

Revolutionary people around the world have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Every day, we receive hundreds and thousands of letters from readers all over the world. These are not ordinary letters but the sincere hearts of revolutionaries. They express their deepest feelings and use the most beautiful language to praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A reader from Morocco, Lailes Ahamed, wrote enthusiastically: "Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts are like an boundless ocean. There is only one correct thought in the world, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. It has illuminated China and also illuminated the whole world." A reader from Venezuela, Brad, said: "Chairman Mao's books and his spirit, thoughts, and teachings are the enriched, developed, and proven Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is an ever-burning torch, illuminating the path forward for the people of the world in their struggle for liberation and true freedom." A revolutionary fighter from Argentina, Ace Mario, wrote: "I have read many of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao is the finest communist after Marx and Lenin. China is a model for Latin America."

The working people of the world love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and have unlimited trust in the great leader Chairman Mao. An Austrian, Charles, said: "Chairman Mao is the leader of the oppressed and exploited peoples of all countries." The working people of West Germany praised him with passionate poems:

	Mao Zedong, star in the sky,
	Your radiant light shines brightly;
	In this turbulent world, you are the hope of the proletariat of the world. No one can separate us; what unites us is our common ideal; Mao Zedong, you are our hope! You are the eagle standing on the peak!

The revolutionary treasure—Chairman Mao's works—is indispensable spiritual nourishment, a compass, and the most powerful weapon for revolutionary people. Therefore, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are terrified and enraged by the spread of Chairman Mao's works in their countries and frantically try to block and destroy them.

In India, the reactionary Congress Party government, with the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is frenziedly anti-China, using the so-called "Defense of India Act" to explicitly ban the import of Chinese publications. However, Indian revolutionary people, in their quest for truth, travel hundreds of miles to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi to obtain Chairman Mao's works. Some, arrested and imprisoned by the reactionaries, still find ways to bring Chairman Mao's works into prison. Why? An Indian university student said well: "Today's India is like pre-liberation China. The people can no longer endure it. Believe my words, India will soon have a revolution and follow the path of China." A reader in Japan was arrested and imprisoned by the reactionaries and eventually died in prison from illness. Before his death, he insisted on studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and in his last moments, he wrote a poem expressing his determination: "Hearing the truth in the morning and dying in the evening is not too late; with a single heart and mind, seek the truth; even in illness, do not forget your lifelong wish, carefully read the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.'"

In countries controlled by the Soviet revisionist clique, openly reading Chairman Mao's works can lead to surveillance or expulsion; some may even be secretly arrested or sent to mental asylums. However, in these countries, there are still many revolutionaries who read Chairman Mao's works, hang portraits of Chairman Mao, and wear Chairman Mao badges. A reader from the Soviet Union wrote from prison: "I believe in the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. I had hoped that one day someone would speak out. You were the first to do so, and it is wonderful!" He also specially stated: "Please forgive me for writing so simply, but I am currently in prison. Please believe that the vast majority of Russians support China."

The revolutionary treasure of the world's people—Chairman Mao's works—is not easy to obtain abroad. During the Algerian War of Independence, a few copies of Chairman Mao's works were circulated among the people's army. A combat unit was fortunate to obtain one, and they specially chose a careful soldier to keep it. This soldier carried the precious book with him, and in one battle, an enemy bullet took his life. Other soldiers, discovering this, rushed to the fallen comrade and retrieved the book. Today, on the front lines of the anti-American struggle in Vietnam, a peasant family obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao and a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." From then on, every time American aggressor planes came to bomb, they would hear the air raid alarm, not first taking their belongings, but grabbing Chairman Mao's portrait and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

In Laos, during a battle against American air raids, a young soldier unfortunately fell in a pool of blood. With his last strength, he handed over the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," stained red with his blood, to a comrade beside him, and instructed, "You must read it well."

Mao Zedong Thought inspires the people to fight.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an infinite and invincible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of tremendous power." Every time we read this profound scientific statement, the moving deeds of countless people abroad who study and apply Chairman Mao's works in class struggle and production struggle come to our minds.

In Japan, the broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teachings, hold up banners reading "Rebellion is justified" and march in demonstrations, fiercely attacking U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese revisionist Miyamoto clique. For example, an old Communist Party member, Takashi Takahashi, wrote: "I am a Communist Party member with twenty years of party experience, fifty-six years old. Because I opposed the Japanese Communist Party's downward slide into revisionism, I was expelled from the party." "But with the help of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, I can gradually raise the banner of revolution and firmly fight against the revisionists, and I have firm confidence and courage in the revolutionary future."

In war-torn Vietnam, commanders say: "The greatest help the Chinese people have given to the Vietnamese people is Chairman Mao's military thought." Soldiers say: "Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp weapon to defeat U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. If we act according to Chairman Mao's words, we will surely defeat U.S. imperialism!" Not only soldiers but also workers and peasants are striving to study Mao Zedong Thought. For example, a young worker in a salt field said: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal red sun." Some peasants, in their anti-drought struggle, not only use Chairman Mao's thoughts on concentrating forces to win decisive battles to mobilize manpower and resources but also sing the song of "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" while working.

On both banks of the Congo River in Africa, Mao Zedong Thought has brought great inspiration and fighting spirit to the people. In Congo (Brazzaville), a person with paralyzed legs lives more than a hundred miles from the capital Brazzaville, but to obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's works, he moved step by step to the capital. He said, "Seeing Chairman Mao's portrait gives me strength and courage," "Reading Chairman Mao's books can overcome all difficulties." A soldier from Congo (Brazzaville) said: "What I need first is Mao Zedong Thought, second is a gun."

Congo (Leopoldville) is currently under the white terror of colonialism, and reading Chairman Mao's works and Chinese newspapers is extremely difficult. However, prison bars, batons, and butcher knives can never stop revolutionaries from seeking truth and learning contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the living Marxism-Leninism of Mao Zedong Thought. A reader named Fawus wrote enthusiastically: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the revolutionary people of the world. My most beloved Chairman Mao is the lighthouse of the world revolution." Soldiers imprisoned with Lumumba also wrote letters, asking us to send them Chairman Mao's works and the "Beijing Weekly."

A student from Africa studying in Eastern Europe was expelled by the revisionist authorities for loving New China and agreeing with the views of the Communist Party of China on the international communist movement. Surrounding students sympathized with him. But he was not concerned, as if everything was expected, and said calmly: "Expelling me is nothing. Going back is just for the revolution. Chairman Mao said: 'The people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history.' This time I go back, I will go to the people, and with them, take up arms to fight."

Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread around the world.

The brilliant works of Chairman Mao are being published in increasingly large quantities around the world. Mao Zedong Thought, crossing mountains and rivers, is widely spread around the world, and more and more revolutionary masses are striving to study Chairman Mao's works and grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Burmese communists say: "We have experienced nearly twenty years of military struggle. We believe that with Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we fear no enemy." "We should all be Mao Zedong-style communists." Indonesian communists, through the "September 30th" incident, drew a bloody lesson, saying: "For Indonesian Marxist-Leninists who are determined to defend Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism, studying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, especially Mao Zedong Thought, is of great importance."

German revolutionaries issued a call to arms for the publication and distribution of the German edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." The first task in the call to arms is: "Spread the red pocketbook to our great homeland—the German Democratic Republic, occupied West Berlin, and West Germany where public opinion is suppressed." The second task requires "studying and applying this red pocketbook with workers, peasants, and soldiers!" The sixth task is "to strive for the mastery, proficiency, defense, and application of true Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" They also called for "deeply studying Comrade Lin Biao's 'Preface to the Second Edition,' and arming ourselves with the knowledge learned." In the call to arms, they proposed revolutionary battle slogans such as: "Support Comrade Mao Zedong and the red pocketbook! Oppose China's Khrushchev and 'Cultivation'! Strive for the complete victory of Mao Zedong's revolutionary thoughts in East and West Germany!"

The revolutionary faction in Venezuela issued a call to study Chairman Mao's works, especially emphasizing the "Three Articles," and quoted Comrade Lin Biao's words: "Take the 'Three Articles' as a motto to study."

Revolutionary people around the world are striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. With an open mind, looking to the future, the development of human history will definitely advance to victory under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    读毛主席的书，走毛主席指出的革命道
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀着全世界革命人民胜利的道路。世界广大革命人民通过自己的亲身革命斗争实践，越来越认识到“读毛主席的书，走毛主席指出的革命道路”，这是唯一正确的光明大道。
    在毛泽东思想指引下的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，对全世界产生了巨大的影响。一位非洲朋友说：“中国在毛主席领导下前进，从一个胜利走向一个胜利，中国是我们非洲人民勇敢、信心和决心的榜样”。刚果（金）的读者来信说，过去中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，推翻了三座大山，今天掌握了毛泽东思想，成了反对美帝、苏修的强大力量，我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就能消灭新老殖民主义。
    正因为这样，文化大革命一年多来，毛主席著作对外发行量超过了十四年来的总和，尤其是《毛主席语录》正式对外发行不到一年，发行量即达到一百三十余万册，遍及全世界一百二十八个国家和地区。此外，在这一年多来，还有十六个国家一些出版社用本国文字翻译出版了毛主席著作。有数十个国家许多革命群众组织了专门的小组，有组织、有计划地学习毛主席著作。
    毛主席是世界革命人民心中的红太阳
    全世界革命人民无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。我们每天都收到来自世界各地的成百成千封读者来信，这不是普通的信，而是革命者的一颗颗热诚的心。他们用最真挚的感情，最美好的语言歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。摩洛哥读者莱尔斯·阿哈迈德来信热情洋溢地说：“毛主席的光辉思想象无边无际的海洋。世界上只有一个思想正确，这就是毛泽东思想。它照亮了中国，也照亮了全世界。”委内瑞拉的布拉达说：“毛主席的书和他的精神、思想以及他的教导都是丰富、发展了并且经过人民群众实践而证明了的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是一盏永不熄灭的明灯，为世界人民争取解放和真正的自由照亮了前进的道路。”阿根廷革命战士阿塞·马里奥来信说：“我读过许多毛主席著作。毛主席是继马克思、列宁之后最优秀的共产主义者，中国是拉丁美洲的榜样。”
    全世界劳动人民热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想，对伟大领袖毛主席无限信赖。奥地利查理德说：毛主席“是各国被压迫被剥削人民的领袖。”西德的劳动人民用充满激情的诗篇赞颂：
    毛泽东啊，天上的星，
    你灿烂光辉放光明；
    在这动荡的世界上，你是全世界无产者的希望。谁也不能把我们拆散，团结我们的是共同的理想；毛泽东，你是我们的希望！你是屹立高峰的雄鹰！毛主席著作是革命的宝
    革命的宝书——毛主席著作，对革命人民来说是不可缺少的精神食粮，是方向盘，是最有力的武器。因此帝、修、反对于毛主席著作在当地流传怕得要死，恨得要命，疯狂地进行封锁、破坏。
    在印度，反动的国大党政府在美帝苏修支持下疯狂反华，以所谓《保卫印度法》明令禁止中国出版物进口。但是印度革命人民为了寻求真理，有的跋涉数百里到新德里中国大使馆去要毛主席著作；有的人遭反动派逮捕入狱，可是却仍然想方设法寻亲托友把毛主席著作带进监狱去。为什么？一位印度大学生说得好：“今天的印度，就象解放前的中国一样，人民再也忍受不下去了。请相信我的话，印度很快就会爆发革命，走中国的道路。”日本有一位读者被反动派逮捕入狱，最后病死在狱中，生前他一直坚持学习《毛泽东选集》，临死前还写了一首诗表示自己的决心：“朝闻夕死不为迟，一心一意寻真理；病中不忘终身愿，细读《毛泽东选集》。”
    在苏修集团控制的国家里，公开阅读毛主席著作就要受到监视或开除；有的甚至会遭到秘密逮捕，或送进疯人院。但是在这些国家仍然有许许多多革命者阅读毛主席著作，悬挂毛主席的画像，佩戴毛主席的像章。有一位苏联读者自狱中来信说：“我相信马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的理论。我曾期待有朝一日总会有人发出自己的声音。你们第一个这样做了，真太好了！”他还特地声明说：“请原谅，我给你们写得非常简单，要知道我目前是在监狱里。请相信，绝大多数俄罗斯人是支持中国的。”
    世界人民革命的宝书——毛主席著作，在国外要得到一本是很不容易的。在阿尔及利亚抗法战争时期，在人民军里传阅着少数几本毛主席著作。一个战斗组有幸得到一本，他们特地选了一位比较细心的战士保管。这个战士随身携带着这本宝书，在一次战斗中，敌人的子弹夺去了他的生命，其他战士发现这个情况，便奋身冲到那位牺牲的战友身边，抢出了这本书。今天，战斗在抗美最前线的越南，有一家农民得到了一张毛主席像和一本《毛主席语录》。从此以后，每次美国强盗飞机来轰炸的时候，他们听到空袭警报，不是先拿自己的财物，而是首先拿上毛主席像和《毛主席语录》。
    在老挝，一次抗击美国空中强盗轰炸的战斗中，有一位年青的战士不幸中弹倒在血泊中，他用尽最后的力量，把揣在怀中已被鲜血染得通红的《毛泽东选集》递给身边的战友，还一字一句地嘱咐战友：“一定要好好地读。”
    毛泽东思想鼓舞人民战斗
    林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”每当我们读到这段精辟的科学论述时，国外无数在阶级斗争、生产斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹就浮现在我们的眼前。
    在日本，广大的革命群众，根据毛主席的教导，他们高举“造反有理”的标语牌游行示威，大造美日反动派和日修宫本集团的反。如老共产党员高桥勇来信说：“我是已有二十年党龄，五十六岁的老共产党员，由于我反对日本共产党走向修正主义的下坡路，被开除出党了”。“但由于战无不胜的毛泽东思想帮助我，我能逐渐举起鲜明的革命大旗，同修正主义分子进行坚决的斗争，而且对革命的前途抱有坚定的信心和勇气。”
    在战火纷飞的越南，指挥员说：“中国人民对越南人民的最大援助是毛主席的军事思想。”战士们说：“毛泽东思想是战胜美帝国主义和现代修正主义的锐利武器，我们按照毛主席的话去做，就一定能够打败美帝国主义！”不仅战士如此，工人、农民也在努力学习毛泽东思想，如一位盐场的青年工人说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，毛泽东思想是永远不落的红太阳。”有的农民在抗旱斗争中不仅运用毛主席关于集中力量打歼灭战的思想调动人力、物力，而且在劳动中高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌。
    在非洲刚果河两岸，毛泽东思想给人民带来巨大的鼓舞和战斗力。刚果（布）有一位下肢瘫痪的人，居住在离首都布拉柴维尔一百多里之外，但他为了得到一张毛主席像和毛主席著作，便一点一点地移步到首都。他说，“看到毛主席像就增添了力量和勇气”，“读了毛主席的书能够战胜一切困难。”刚果（布）一位战士说：“我需要的第一是毛泽东思想，第二是枪。”
    刚果（金）目前仍然处在殖民主义的白色恐怖之中，阅读毛主席著作和中国报刊那是十分困难的。但是铁窗、警棍、屠刀终究无法阻止革命者寻找真理的意志，无法阻止他们学习当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。有一位叫法乌斯的读者来信极其热情地说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的指路明灯。我最敬爱的毛主席是全世界革命的灯塔。”被关在监牢里的卢蒙巴的士兵，也千方百计写信来，要求我们设法寄去毛主席著作和《北京周报》。
    一位在东欧留学的非洲学生，由于热爱新中国，同意中国共产党关于国际共产主义运动的观点，被修正主义当局无理宣布勒令退学。周围一些同学都很同情他。而他却毫不在乎，好象一切都在意料中，很坦然地说：“赶我回去，没有什么。回去，正好闹革命。毛主席说：‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。’我这次回去，就是要到人民中去，和他们一起，拿起枪去战斗。”
    毛泽东思想在世界广泛传播
    毛主席的光辉著作在全世界的发行，数量越来越大。毛泽东思想越过重山峻岭在世界广泛传播，越来越多的革命群众努力学习毛主席著作，掌握了毛泽东思想。缅甸的共产党人说：“我们经历了近二十年的军事斗争。我们认为，有了毛泽东思想做我们的指南，什么敌人我们都不怕。”“我们都应该做毛泽东式的共产党。”印尼共产党人通过“九·卅”事件得出了血的教训，他们说：“对于决心捍卫马克思列宁主义和反对现代修正主义的印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说，特别是学习毛泽东思想具有非常重要的意义。”
    德国的革命者则为德文版《毛主席语录》的出版发行，发出号召书。号召书第一项任务就是：“把红色袖珍书散发到我们伟大祖国——德意志民主共和国，被占领的西柏林和舆论受到箝制的西德——的各地。”第二项任务，要求“同工人、农民、士兵一起活学活用这本红色袖珍书！”第六项任务是“为掌握、精通、捍卫和运用真正的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想而奋斗！”还号召“深入学习林彪同志的《再版前言》，并用所学到的知识武装自己。”在号召书里提出了：“拥护毛泽东同志和红色袖珍书！反对中国的赫鲁晓夫和《修养》！争取毛泽东革命思想在民主德国和西德的完全胜利而奋斗！”等革命的战斗口号。
    委内瑞拉的革命派发出号召学习毛主席著作，特别提到“老三篇”，而且引证了林彪同志的话：“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学。”
    世界各国的革命人民都在努力活学活用毛主席著作。放开眼界看未来，人类历史的发展一定会按照伟大舵手毛主席指引的方向胜利前进！
