	The military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam eliminated nearly 2,200 enemy forces in one month, from July 26 to August 26. Among the casualties were 790 American soldiers and nearly 100 South Korean mercenaries. They also shot down or damaged 18 enemy aircraft and destroyed 19 military vehicles.

	According to the report, during this month, guerrilla forces in some counties eliminated and demoralized nearly 600 enemy forces, including 462 American soldiers.

	During this period, the liberation armed forces conducted several large-scale battles and achieved brilliant victories. For example, on August 21, in the battles at Ho Mountain and Chi Mountain, the liberation armed forces annihilated over 200 invading troops from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, completely wiping out an American company.

	The liberation armed forces in the northern part of Quang Nam Province, South Vietnam, launched a fierce artillery attack on the Noman American airbase near Da Nang on the night of August 27 and the early morning of August 28. They destroyed 40 enemy aircraft and killed or wounded 150 American invaders. According to the report, within a few minutes after the battle began, the artillery shells of the liberation armed forces accurately hit the airfield's parking lot and enemy barracks, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

	This was the fourth attack by the liberation armed forces on the Noman airbase since October 1965. In these four attacks, the liberation armed forces destroyed or damaged 250 enemy aircraft and eliminated 713 American soldiers.
