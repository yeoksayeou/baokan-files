The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China strongly protests the Indonesian reactionary government's brazen expulsion of our diplomatic personnel. The Indonesian reactionary government's wanton destruction of bilateral relations is inexcusable. We declare the Indonesian Acting Charge d'Affaires and Second Secretary as persona non grata and order them to leave the country within a specified time.

	New China News Agency, September 25th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on the 25th, strongly protesting the Indonesian reactionary government's brazen expulsion of the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Lü Zibo, and the Second Secretary and Consul, Su Sheng, as anti-China atrocities.

	The note announced that due to the Indonesian reactionary government's rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, bilateral relations have been severely damaged. The Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Nahar, and the Second Secretary, Rumanbi, have engaged in activities that harm bilateral relations during their tenure. Therefore, the Chinese government declares the aforementioned individuals as persona non grata and orders them to leave Chinese territory by September 29th.

	The note states: The Indonesian reactionary government brazenly announced on September 14th that the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Lü Zibo, and the Second Secretary and Consul, Su Sheng, are "persona non grata" and ordered them to leave the country within a specified time. This is another serious step by the Indonesian reactionary government to completely sever bilateral relations and is a serious provocation against the 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese government and people express great indignation and strongly protest against this.

	The note states: The reactionary government led by Suharto and Nasution has always sold out to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, implementing counter-revolutionary policies of selling out the country, dictatorship, anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-China. With the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought increasingly illuminates the path forward for the revolutionary people of Indonesia. The Indonesian reactionary government senses the approaching end of its days. Therefore, it further intensifies anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, systematically and step-by-step pushing bilateral relations to the brink of complete rupture. Following the August 5th savage attack on the Chinese Embassy, the top leaders of the Indonesian reactionary government, led by Suharto, have taken the lead in inciting anti-China sentiments, continuously spreading rumors, slandering, threatening, and provoking the Chinese Embassy, creating public opinion to expel Chinese diplomatic personnel and sever diplomatic relations with China. At the same time, they have intensified their full-scale collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, even inviting the so-called "trade delegation" of the Chiang clique to Indonesia to engage in conspiratorial activities. Notably, the Indonesian reactionary government's Foreign Minister Malik has even boasted about establishing a relationship higher than the trade representative level with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and absurdly claiming that it can recognize the so-called "Republic of Taiwan."

	The note points out: Numerous facts show that the Indonesian reactionary government has long decided to sever diplomatic relations with China. However, you are also afraid to take responsibility for severing bilateral relations, fearing to fully expose your reactionary face to the Indonesian people and the people of the world, thereby accelerating your own doom. Therefore, you have come up with the absurd idea of trying to shift the responsibility for severing bilateral relations onto China.

	The note states: For this evil purpose, you have fabricated a full of loopholes lie and used it as an excuse to expel the Chinese Acting Charge d'Affaires and Second Secretary and Consul. You absurdly claim that the Chinese Embassy opened fire on August 5th, injuring three Indonesian thugs and one soldier, which is purely absurd fabrication. The people of the world see clearly that on August 5th, the armed military police and thugs sent by the Indonesian reactionary government launched a savage attack on the Chinese Embassy. It was the Indonesian thugs who set fire to the embassy building and injured four Chinese diplomatic personnel; it was the Indonesian reactionary military police who stormed into the embassy, firing hundreds of shots, deliberately injuring Indonesian thugs and soldiers in the chaos, intending to use this vicious method to frame the Chinese Embassy, creating a bigger anti-China atrocity. At that time, the Indonesian propaganda machine, to cooperate with this conspiracy, also indeed made a big fuss for a while. However, lies can never cover up the truth. The Chief of Staff of the Jakarta Military Region, Naseri, admitted that someone saw that the thugs were shot down by the Indonesian armed forces' low-angle fire. The official of the Protocol Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also had to admit in the face of facts that "the direction of the bullet shooting was from outside to inside." This is a resounding slap in the face that the Indonesian side gave itself, making your lies exposed and completely bankrupt. More than a month later, you picked up this lie that cannot deceive anyone again. Don't you feel that you are too stupid and laughably childish?

	The note warns the Indonesian reactionary government: Your reliance on lies to live proves how far you have fallen. You frantically engage in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, wantonly destroying bilateral relations, committing countless crimes, and the ironclad evidence is overwhelming. You cannot shirk responsibility. You are determined to act as the anti-China running dogs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and will absolutely not escape the righteous condemnation of the people of the world, and the severe punishment of the Chinese and Indonesian people.

　　我外交部强烈抗议印尼反动政府悍然驱赶我外交人员
　　印尼反动政府肆意破坏两国关系罪责难逃
　　我宣布印尼驻华临时代办和二等秘书为不受欢迎的人并限期离境
    新华社二十五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部二十五日照会印尼驻华大使馆，对印尼反动政府悍然驱赶中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波和二等秘书兼领事苏生的反华暴行，提出最强烈的抗议。
  照会宣布，由于印尼反动政府猖狂反华排华，使两国关系遭到严重破坏，而印尼驻华大使馆临时代办纳哈尔和二等秘书鲁曼比在任职期间进行了损害两国关系的活动，因此中国政府宣布上述二人为不受欢迎的人，并限定他们在九月二十九日以前离开中国国境。
    照会说：印尼反动政府悍然于九月十四日宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波和二等秘书兼领事苏生为“不受欢迎的人”，并限期离境。这是印尼反动政府完全破裂两国关系的又一严重步骤，是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动政府，一贯卖身投靠美帝、苏修，执行卖国、独裁、反共、反人民、反华的反革命政策。随着震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，光焰无际的毛泽东思想日益照亮着印尼革命人民的前进道路。印尼反动政府从这里预感到自己末日的临近。因此，进一步加剧反华、排华活动，有计划、有步骤地把两国关系推到完全破裂的境地。继八月五日疯狂袭击中国大使馆之后，印尼反动政府的最大头目苏哈托就带头猖狂煽动反华情绪，不断对中国大使馆进行造谣、诬蔑、恫吓和挑衅，制造驱赶中国外交人员和同中国断绝外交关系的舆论。与此同时，又加紧同蒋介石匪帮全面勾结，甚至邀请蒋帮的所谓“贸易代表团”到印尼进行阴谋活动。尤其值得注意的是，印尼反动政府的外交部长马利克竟然叫嚣要同蒋介石匪帮建立“比贸易代表机构高一级的关系”，还胡说什么可以承认所谓“台湾共和国”。
    照会指出：无数事实表明，印尼反动政府早就决心同中国断绝外交关系。但是，你们又作贼心虚，不敢承担断绝两国关系的罪责，害怕在印尼人民和世界人民面前彻底暴露你们的反动面目，从而加速自己的灭亡。因此，你们异想天开，千方百计地企图把断绝两国关系的责任，转嫁给中国。
    照会说：为了这个罪恶目的，你们竟然制造了一个破绽百出的谎言，并以此为借口驱赶中国临时代办和二等秘书兼领事。你们胡说什么中国大使馆于八月五日开枪打伤三名印尼暴徒和一名军人，这纯粹是荒诞无稽的捏造。世界人民看得很清楚，在八月五日，印尼反动政府指使的武装军警和暴徒对中国大使馆进行疯狂的袭击时，正是印尼暴徒纵火焚烧了大使馆房屋，打伤了四名中国外交人员；正是印尼的反动军警冲进大使馆，开枪数百发，有计划地在混乱中打伤印尼暴徒和军人，蓄意制造事件，妄图用这个毒辣手段嫁祸于中国大使馆，制造更大的反华暴行。当时，印尼的宣传机器，为了配合这一阴谋，也的确象煞有介事地喧嚣一时。但是，谎言总是掩盖不了事实，雅加达军区参谋长纳赛里就不打自招，承认有人看到，暴徒是在印尼武装部队对院内暴徒实行低射击的时候倒下去的。印尼外交部礼宾司官员在事实面前，也不得不承认“子弹射击的方向是从外面向内射击的”。这是印尼方面自己给自己打的一记响亮耳光，使你们的谣言不揭自穿，彻底破产。事隔一个多月，你们又重新拣起这个骗不了人的谎言，难道你们不感到自己太愚蠢，太幼稚可笑了吗？
    照会正告印尼反动政府：你们靠谎言过日子恰恰证明你们已堕落到何等地步。你们拚命反华排华，肆意破坏两国关系，罪行累累，铁证如山，要赖是赖不掉的。你们死心塌地充当美帝、苏修反华小走卒，绝对逃脱不了世界人民的正义谴责，逃脱不了中国和印尼人民的严厉惩罚。
