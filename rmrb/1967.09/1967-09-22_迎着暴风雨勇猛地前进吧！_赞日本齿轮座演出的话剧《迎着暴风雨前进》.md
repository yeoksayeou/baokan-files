March Forward Bravely Against the Storm!
—In Praise of the Japanese Gear Theater's Performance of "March Forward Against the Storm"
Temporary Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Military Region's Friendship Troupe

In the midst of the great victory songs of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Japanese Gear Theater visiting performance troupe presented us with a series of excellent performances on the stage of our great capital, Beijing. Following the performance of the historical drama "Wildfire," which reflects the famous peasant armed struggle in Japanese history, they performed the contemporary drama "March Forward Against the Storm," which praises the heroic anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle of the Japanese working class. We warmly congratulate the success of this performance.

The creation and performance of "March Forward Against the Storm" is a great victory for the Japanese working class in uniting with the broad masses of peasants, raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and hoisting the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism; it is a great victory for Japanese revolutionary artists in adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of literature and art and fighting against all decadent, declining, and various forms of bourgeois literary and artistic trends, especially revisionist literary and artistic trends.

"March Forward Against the Storm" depicts the young workers of the Suo Public Bus Company's Iwakuni Branch in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, who are united under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party's leftist Suo Public Bus Company Branch, with Hamaoka Satoshi and Midori as the core, using Chairman Mao's books as their guide and Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, firmly defending the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and waging an unyielding struggle against the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Japanese reactionaries, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists.

The revolutionary leftists of the Japanese Communist Party in Yamaguchi Prefecture took the lead in rebelling against the Miyamoto clique in September last year (1966) and established the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist). Under the leadership of this leftist organization, the true Marxist-Leninists in Japan have, through practical actions, thoroughly smashed the revisionist line of the Miyamoto clique, which collaborates with the Soviet Union, capitulates to the United States, opposes China, and betrays the interests of the Japanese people, and firmly established the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They have ignited the revolutionary fire and fanned the revolutionary wind in various mass organizations in Japan. The struggle of the Iwakuni workers and the struggle of the farmers in Ono, as reflected in "March Forward Against the Storm," are but waves in this vast and surging struggle. The play tightly grasps the most contemporary and most revealing plot elements, centering on the Japanese workers' destruction of the so-called "third rationalization" and their struggle to realize the Great Friendship Festival between Chinese and Japanese youth, and deeply exposes a major issue in Japan and the world today: the attitude towards the great People's Republic of China, the attitude towards the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, the attitude towards the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the attitude towards China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the dividing line and touchstone between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists. This play powerfully answers this question through its vivid depiction of the fiery reality of the struggle and its true portrayal of the characters.

"March Forward Against the Storm" also passionately praises the heroic figures advancing in the storm of the times, successfully creating a group of heroes with the spirit of a storm petrel, centered around the "Wildfire Society." Among them are the daring and victorious, calm and experienced Hamaoka Satoshi; the vigorous and fearless, yet skilled in mobilizing the masses, Midori; the disabled but spirited West River, who carries the revolutionary spark wherever he goes; the Shinya, who remembers the class hatred of three generations; the brave and somewhat naive Hironaka, who pursues truth; the Ando, who harbors deep hatred for the American imperialists; and the honest Daff, the old driver Matsuda, the just and truth-seeking Kuwahara, and the temporarily deceived by the Japanese revisionists, but once awakened, fiercely fighting Eiko, and so on, all of whom left a deep impression on the audience. The common characteristic of these characters is their strong spirit of rebellion, fearlessness of difficulties, and daring to struggle. Each of them is like a flame, a revolutionary flame, an unquenchable flame, a flame that will soon spread across the whole of Japan. This revolutionary spirit of rebellion is forged from their social struggle practice, and more importantly, from the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. These young people have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and regard reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in their struggle life. The red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is always with them, and they actively learn and apply it at all times. Chairman Mao's words have increased their fighting courage and guided their direction of struggle.

In "March Forward Against the Storm," we see the Japanese working class, especially the younger generation, standing up and taking action under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the leftist Japanese Communist Party. As the theme song sings, "The struggle begins here, the struggle begins now." These new generations are the hope of the Japanese working class and the hope of the entire Japanese nation and people. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his "Talk on Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against American Imperialism and for National Independence": "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." The Japanese people will not long endure the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese reactionaries, nor will they long be deceived and cheated by the Soviet revisionists and Japanese revisionists. Now they have awakened and are fighting.

"March Forward Against the Storm" is also a success in terms of art. It starts from the theme, content, characters, and the needs of the struggle, using bold brushstrokes to reveal the theme of struggle, portray new characters, and form a unique style.

Comrades of the Japanese Gear Theater troupe, strong anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist fighters, let us join hands and march forward bravely against the storm!

　　迎着暴风雨勇猛地前进吧！
　　——赞日本齿轮座演出的话剧《迎着暴风雨前进》
    北京部队战友文工团革命委员会临时筹委会
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命的一片凯歌声中，日本齿轮座访华演出团在我们伟大的首都——北京的舞台上，演出了连台好戏。继演出反映日本历史上著名的农民武装斗争的话剧《野火》之后，又给我们演出了歌颂日本当代工人阶级英勇反帝反修斗争的话剧《迎着暴风雨前进》。我们热烈地祝贺这次演出的成功。
    《迎着暴风雨前进》的创作和演出是日本工人阶级联合广大农民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举反帝反修旗帜的重大胜利；是日本革命的文艺工作者坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线同一切腐朽的、没落的、形形色色的资产阶级文艺思潮，特别是修正主义文艺思潮斗争的重大胜利。
    《迎着暴风雨前进》描写的是日本山口县日美合资的周防公共汽车公司岩国营业所的青年工人同志们，团结在以滨口哲、翠子为核心的日本共产党左派周防公共汽车公司党总支的周围，以毛主席的书为指南，以毛泽东思想为武器，坚决捍卫日中两国人民的战斗友谊，与美帝、苏修、日本反动派、日共修正主义分子展开不屈不挠的斗争的故事。
    日共山口县的革命左派，早在去年（一九六六年）九月首先造了宫本集团的反，成立了日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）。在这个左派组织的领导下，日本真正的马列主义者以实际行动大破宫本集团联苏、降美、反华、叛卖日本人民利益的修正主义路线，大立马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，在日本各个群众团体中点革命之火，煽革命之风。《迎着暴风雨前进》所反映的岩国工人斗争与小野的农民斗争，就是这个波澜壮阔的斗争中的一个浪花。这个戏紧紧地抓住了最有时代特征，最能反映问题本质的情节，以日本工人摧毁所谓第三次合理化和争取实现日中青年友好大联欢运动为中心，比较深刻地揭示了目前在日本，也是在全世界一个重大的问题：即对待伟大的中华人民共和国的态度问题，对待日中两国人民的战斗友谊的态度问题，对待伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的态度问题，对待中国的无产阶级文化大革命的态度问题。用什么态度对待毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化大革命，这是马列主义者和修正主义者的分水岭与试金石。这出戏，以火热的现实斗争生活的描绘和人物形象的真实刻划有力地回答了这个问题。
    《迎着暴风雨前进》还热情洋溢地歌颂了在时代的暴风雨中前进的英雄人物，成功地塑造了以“野火会”为中心的一组具有海燕一样坚强性格的英雄群象。其中有敢于斗争、敢于胜利、沉着而老练的滨口哲，有朝气勃勃不畏强暴而又善于联系群众的翠子，有身残志不残，走到哪里把革命火种带到哪里的西川，有牢记三代阶级仇的伸一，有勇于追求真理而又稍带一些稚气的弘子，有满怀着对美帝深仇大恨的和枝以及朴实的达夫，老司机松田，富于正义、敢于追求真理的桑原和暂时受了日修蒙蔽、一旦觉悟就奋身战斗的惠子等等，都给观众留下了深刻的印象。这一组人物在性格上的共同特征是具有强烈的造反精神，不怕困难，敢于斗争。他们每个人都象一团火，革命的火，扑不灭的火，将要燃遍整个日本的燎原之火。这种革命造反精神的铸成，是来自他们的社会斗争实践，更主要的是来自伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这些青年无限热爱毛主席，把读毛主席的书当作自己斗争生活的第一需要。红彤彤的《毛主席语录》随身带，随时随地地活学活用。毛主席的话增强了他们战斗的勇气，指引着他们斗争的方向。
    在《迎着暴风雨前进》中，我们看到了日本工人阶级特别是年青的一代，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在日本共产党左派的领导下，站起来了，行动起来了。正如主题歌中所唱的“斗争就从这里开始，斗争就从现在开始”。这些新的一代是日本工人阶级的希望，也是整个日本民族、日本人民的希望。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席在《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》中所指出的：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”日本人民绝不会长期忍受日本反动派的压榨与剥削，也绝不会长期受苏修与日修的蒙蔽和欺骗。如今他们已经觉醒起来战斗了。
    《迎着暴风雨前进》在艺术上也是成功的，它从主题出发，从内容出发，从人物出发，从斗争的需要出发，以泼辣的笔触揭示了战斗的主题，刻划了崭新的人物，构成了独特的风格。
    日本齿轮座剧团的全体革命文艺战友们，坚强的反帝、反修的战士们，让我们携起手来，迎着暴风雨勇猛地前进吧！
