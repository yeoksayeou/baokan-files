In the face of an unprecedentedly good situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a mass trial of counter-revolutionaries on September 12, boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and striking a blow against the reactionary forces of the domestic and foreign class enemies, demonstrating the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship.

At the trial, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, with the approval of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China, sentenced four active counter-revolutionary murderers and robbers to death, to be executed immediately; sentenced one criminal murderer to death with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to observe his behavior; sentenced one spy to life imprisonment; and sentenced one counter-revolutionary arsonist to ten years in prison.

The presiding officer of the meeting pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital is in an excellent situation. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us, "The enemy will not perish of itself." "The imperialists and the domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their failure. They will make their last struggle." In the current great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, along with the American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and hooligans, are colluding and cooperating to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is absolutely intolerable and must be resolutely suppressed! Today, the world belongs to the proletarian dictatorship. We are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship. If the class enemies dare to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will resolutely strike them down and severely punish them, showing no mercy!

More than ten thousand proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary masses attending the trial enthusiastically supported the stern judgment of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. They repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Resolutely strike down the sabotage activities of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to maintain the revolutionary order in the capital!" "Heighten revolutionary vigilance and smash all the conspiracies and sabotage activities of the class enemies!" "Rely on the masses and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship!" "The People's Liberation Army is a mighty pillar of the proletarian dictatorship!" "Defend Chairman Mao to the death!" "Defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to the death!" "Defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death!" "Defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death!"

Huang Zuozhen, a standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the second political commissar of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. He said, our great motherland's capital, Beijing, is facing an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation. Revolutionary forces are thriving and becoming increasingly consolidated; the counter-revolutionary front is on the verge of total collapse. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Beijing—headed by Peng Zhen—the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, are being criticized and denounced by the broad revolutionary masses, and their plot to restore capitalism has been smashed. Currently, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society are attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right or the ultra-"left." They deceive the masses, instigate armed struggles, disrupt production, and even commit murder and other heinous crimes, taking revenge on the class enemy and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, are frantically carrying out sabotage activities. Today, we are sentencing seven active counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders, which is the shameful end of these jumping jacks!

The meeting believed that we should adopt the policy of combining suppression with leniency towards all counter-revolutionaries and a handful of bandits, being lenient to those who confess and strict to those who resist. Those who have done wrong but confess and are willing to reform should be treated leniently.

The meeting called on the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses of Beijing to heighten their revolutionary vigilance, strengthen their awareness of the enemy, and always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: never forget class struggle, never forget the proletarian dictatorship. All revolutionary organizations and the broad revolutionary masses must actively cooperate with the proletarian dictatorship organs to exercise dictatorship over the class enemies. If the class enemies dare to carry out sabotage activities, we will resolutely suppress them and exercise dictatorship over them, showing no mercy. The proletarian dictatorship organs must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions in the struggle against the enemy, relying on the masses to exercise dictatorship over the enemy. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line can we set up a net from heaven to earth, build an iron wall, fully display the power of the proletarian dictatorship, and defeat all enemies.

Representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, the Beijing Peasants' Congress, the Red Guards of the Capital's Universities and Colleges, and the Red Guards of Secondary Schools also spoke at the meeting.

Those attending today's trial included responsible officials from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supreme People's Court.

    大长无产阶级革命派志气　大灭国内外阶级敌人气焰
    北京市召开镇压反革命宣判大会
    在万人大会上，北京市中级人民法院经中华人民共和国最高人民法院核准，依法宣布判处了一批现行反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子
    新华社十二日讯　在首都无产阶级文化大革命面临空前大好的形势下，北京市革命委员会十二日召开“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决镇压反革命宣判大会”，大长了无产阶级的革命志气，打击了国内外阶级敌人的反动气焰，显示了无产阶级专政的强大威力。
    宣判大会上，北京市中级人民法院经中华人民共和国最高人民法院核准，依法宣布判处四名现行反革命杀人犯、抢劫杀人犯死刑，立即执行；判处一名刑事杀人犯死刑，缓期两年执行，强迫劳动，以观后效；判处一名派遣敌特分子无期徒刑；判处一名反革命纵火犯有期徒刑十年。
    大会的主持人在讲话中指出，首都无产阶级文化大革命是一派大好形势。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派与美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右分子和流氓盗窃分子，互相勾结，互相配合，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，这是我们绝对不能容忍的，必须坚决镇压！今日的天下，是无产阶级专政的天下，我们是在无产阶级专政的条件下进行无产阶级文化大革命的。阶级敌人胆敢破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们就坚决打击，严加惩办，决不宽容！
    参加宣判大会的一万多名无产阶级革命派战士和革命群众，极其热烈地拥护北京市中级人民法院的严正判决。他们不断振臂高呼：“坚决打击地富反坏右的破坏活动，维护首都革命秩序！”“提高革命警惕性，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏活动！”“依靠群众，加强无产阶级专政！”“中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大柱石！”“誓死保卫毛主席！”“誓死保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部！”“誓死保卫中央文革！”“誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线！”
    北京市革命委员会常委、人民解放军北京卫戍区第二政委黄作珍在会上讲了话。他说，我们伟大祖国首都北京，面临着空前大好的革命形势。革命力量蓬勃发展，并且日益巩固；反革命阵线已走向全面崩溃。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在北京的代理人——以彭真为首的反革命修正主义集团，正在受到广大革命群众的批判和声讨，他们复辟资本主义的阴谋被粉碎了。当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的地富反坏右分子，妄图从右的方面或极“左”的方面破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，他们蒙蔽群众，挑动武斗，破坏生产，甚至行凶杀人，无恶不作，进行阶级报复，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。美蒋特务，苏修特务，疯狂地进行破坏活动。今天我们宣判的七个现行反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子，就是这一小撮跳梁小丑的可耻下场！
    大会认为，我们对待一切反革命分子和一小撮匪徒，应当实行镇压与宽大相结合的方针，坦白从宽，抗拒从严，对于那些干过坏事，但能坦白交待，愿意改过自新的，予以从宽处理。
    大会号召北京市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众务必提高革命警惕性，加强敌情观念，要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。各革命组织和广大革命群众必须积极主动配合无产阶级专政机关，对阶级敌人实行专政，如果阶级敌人胆敢进行破坏活动，我们就坚决镇压，坚决专政，决不宽容。无产阶级专政机关在对敌斗争中要坚决执行毛主席的伟大指示，依靠群众对敌专政。只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，才能布下天罗地网，筑成铜墙铁壁，充分发挥无产阶级专政的威力，战胜一切敌人。
    北京市工代会、农代会、首都大专院校红代会、中等学校红代会的代表，也在大会上讲了话。
    参加今天宣判大会的有北京市革命委员会、人民解放军北京卫戍区和公安部、最高人民检察院、最高人民法院等单位的负责人。
