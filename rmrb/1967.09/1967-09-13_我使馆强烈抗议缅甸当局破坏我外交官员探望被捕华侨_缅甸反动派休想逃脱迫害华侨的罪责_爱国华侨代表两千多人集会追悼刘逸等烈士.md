Our Embassy Strongly Protests Myanmar Authorities' Disruption of Our Diplomats Visiting Detained Overseas Chinese
Myanmar Reactionaries Will Not Escape Responsibility for Persecuting Overseas Chinese
Over 2,000 Overseas Chinese Representatives Hold Memorial Service for Martyrs Liu Yi and Others

	BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- YANGON -- Diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar strongly protested to Myanmar officials over the reactionary government's deliberate disruption of Chinese diplomats' visit to detained overseas Chinese.

	On the afternoon of September 5, diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar visited Yangon Central Prison to see Yang Laoqing, a leader of overseas Chinese in Myanmar, and Yang Derong, an overseas Chinese student, who were illegally arrested and detained by the Myanmar reactionary government. They expressed their warm regards and praised their courage in the struggle.

	Yang Laoqing and Yang Derong, during their meeting with the diplomats from their homeland, reported the torture and persecution they and other overseas Chinese had suffered in prison after being illegally arrested by the Myanmar reactionary government, as well as the attempts by the prison authorities to force them to confess.

	However, just as Yang Laoqing and Yang Derong were revealing these facts to the Chinese diplomats, U Tin, the Deputy Director of the Consular Section of the Myanmar Foreign Ministry, and a Myanmar major who was supposedly the prison warden, rudely interrupted the visit. Ignoring the strong protests and warnings from the Chinese diplomats, they ordered soldiers to forcibly remove Yang Laoqing and Yang Derong after only five minutes.

	The Chinese diplomats immediately protested strongly to U Tin and the Myanmar prison warden, condemning their rude and unreasonable disruption of the visit. They pointed out that this unreasonable and violent act by the Myanmar authorities further proved their cruel persecution of the detained overseas Chinese, exposing their guilty conscience.

	BEIJING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- YANGON -- Over 2,000 representatives of overseas Chinese from Yangon and other parts of Myanmar held a solemn memorial service at the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar on September 9 to honor Liu Yi, a Red Overseas Volunteer, martyrs from the Myanmar Overseas Chinese Teachers' Association, the Izaw Singing Group, and the Overseas Chinese Employees' Union, Liu Yingchao, Lin Hongzhu, and other martyrs who sacrificed their lives defending the great thoughts of Mao Zedong and the dignity of the motherland in the face of the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government in Myanmar.

	The memorial service began at 2 PM. The hall was solemnly decorated. Inside the hall, there were quotations from Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "To struggle means to sacrifice. The death of comrades is a common occurrence. ... We die for the people, and that is a worthy death." On the front wall, there were portraits of the martyrs, and on both sides, there were hundreds of couplets sent by over a hundred overseas Chinese organizations and revolutionary youth, filled with revolutionary passion.

	All staff of the Chinese Embassy, Chinese experts in Yangon, and staff from other Chinese institutions in Myanmar attended the memorial service and laid wreaths and flowers in front of the portraits of the martyrs.

	Xiao Ming, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, spoke on behalf of all Chinese comrades working in Myanmar. He said: This memorial service not only expresses our deep sorrow for the martyrs who are "great in life and glorious in death," but also serves as a strong protest against the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government in Myanmar.

	Representatives of Chinese experts working in Myanmar, representatives of the martyrs' families, and representatives of various overseas Chinese organizations unanimously vowed to demand blood debt from the Ne Win reactionary government and fight to the end with the Myanmar reactionaries.

	During the speeches by Xiao Ming and other representatives, the crowd repeatedly chanted: Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest sun in our hearts! Long live the great motherland, the strong backing of the overseas Chinese! Blood debt must be repaid! Down with the Myanmar reactionaries! Long live the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar!

    我使馆强烈抗议缅甸当局破坏我外交官员探望被捕华侨
    缅甸反动派休想逃脱迫害华侨的罪责
    爱国华侨代表两千多人集会追悼刘逸等烈士
    新华社讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆外交官员就缅甸反动当局肆意破坏中国外交官员探望被缅甸反动政府非法逮捕和拘禁的爱国华侨一事，向缅甸官员提出强烈抗议。
    五日下午，中国驻缅甸大使馆外交官员前去探望被缅甸反动政府非法逮捕拘禁在仰光附近的一个监狱中的缅甸爱国华侨领袖杨老清和爱国华侨学生杨德荣，向他们表示亲切慰问，并且赞扬了他们在斗争中表现的英勇气概。
    杨老清和杨德荣在会见来自祖国的亲人的时候，向中国大使馆外交官员控诉了他们和其他爱国华侨被缅甸反动政府非法逮捕之后在监狱里遭到折磨和迫害的情况，以及缅甸监狱当局企图对他们进行逼“供”的情况。
    但是，正当杨老清和杨德荣向中国大使馆外交官员揭露这些情况的时候，缅甸外交部领事司副司长吴丁和一个据说是监狱长的缅甸少校，竟蛮不讲理地破坏了这次探视。他们不顾中国外交官员的强烈抗议和警告，在探视只进行了五分钟，就命令士兵把杨老清和杨德荣强行拉走。
    中国大使馆外交官员立即向吴丁和缅甸监狱长提出强烈抗议，谴责他们蛮横无理地破坏探视，并且指出缅甸当局的这一无理的粗暴行动，进一步证明他们对被捕华侨进行了残酷迫害，暴露了他们做贼心虚的丑态。
    据新华社讯　仰光消息：仰光和缅甸其他地区爱国华侨代表二千多人九日在中国驻缅甸大使馆隆重举行追悼会，悼念红色援外战士刘逸烈士，缅甸华侨教师联合会、伊江合唱团和华侨职员工会的烈士们，刘应超烈士、林鸿珠烈士以及在缅甸奈温反动政府反华排华的法西斯暴行中为捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想和祖国尊严而英勇牺牲的其他烈士。
    追悼会在下午二时举行。追悼会堂布置得极其庄严。会堂内挂着毛主席的语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。……我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”正面墙上挂着烈士们的遗像，两旁挂着百来个华侨团体和革命青少年送的充满着革命激情的数百个挽联。
    中国大使馆的全体人员以及在仰光的中国专家和在缅甸的其他中国机构的全体人员参加了追悼会，并在烈士像前敬献了挽联和花圈。
    中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明代表在缅甸工作的全体中国同志在追悼会上讲话。他说：这个追悼会不仅表示我们对“生的伟大，死的光荣”的烈士们的沉痛哀悼，而且是我们最强烈抗议缅甸奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行的一次声讨会。
    在缅甸工作的中国专家代表、烈士家属的代表和各华侨团体的代表一致表示要向奈温反动政府讨还血债，同缅甸反动派斗争到底。
    肖明和其他代表讲话时，人们一再高呼：我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！强大的祖国是华侨的坚强后盾！血债必须偿还！打倒缅甸反动派！中缅两国人民之间的传统友谊万岁！
