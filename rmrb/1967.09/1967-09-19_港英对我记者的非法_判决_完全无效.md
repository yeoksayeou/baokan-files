	All-China Journalists Association, People's Daily, and Xinhua News Agency Joint Statement
	Hong Kong British Authorities' Illegal "Sentencing" of Our Journalists is Completely Invalid

	Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release our patriotic journalists and compatriots, revoke the illegal "sentencing" of the three patriotic newspapers, compensate for damages, and severely punish the perpetrators.

	According to Xinhua News Agency on September 15, the All-China Journalists Association, People's Daily, and Xinhua News Agency issued a joint statement today, strongly protesting the fascist atrocity of the Hong Kong British authorities' illegal "sentencing" of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Luo Yuhe and four reporters from Wen Hui Bao, Ta Kung Pao, Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and Jing Bao to three years in prison. The statement emphasizes that the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, ignoring the repeated protests of the Chinese government and people, have continued to escalate their persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry and journalists. This is a serious political provocation against Hong Kong patriots and the great Chinese people, and it is absolutely intolerable. We strongly protest against this.

	The statement points out that the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, in order to suppress the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and stifle Hong Kong's patriotic public opinion, have recently focused their attacks on Hong Kong's patriotic news industry and journalists. On September 13, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, after illegally detaining and brutally persecuting Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Yuhe, Wen Hui Bao reporter Huang Yilu, Ta Kung Pao reporter Wang Ning, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reporter Chen Zifeng, and Jing Bao reporter Wu Zaicheng for forty-five days, brazenly handed down an illegal "sentence" of three years in prison. Moreover, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities have recently also illegally arrested Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch staff members Li Ruowen and Liang Shuhua, Ta Kung Pao staff members Zhang Shufen and Shao Ganliang, and dispatched military police and secret agents to launch brazen provocations against the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and other patriotic news organizations.

	The statement points out that the large-scale persecution of Hong Kong's patriotic news industry and journalists by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities has completely torn off their "democratic" and "free" masks. Their evil purpose is to attempt to suppress the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to extinguish the blazing flames of the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle. This is sheer fantasy. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be suppressed, and the sacred right of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots to love their motherland and to love and propagate Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely inviolable. Hong Kong patriots understand: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

	The more the enemy fears and opposes the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, the more Hong Kong compatriots must loudly propagate it and widely organize the study of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	The statement emphasizes that in history, any reactionary who attempted to suppress revolutionary public opinion has met a bad end. The British imperialists in Hong Kong, by attacking the patriotic press, can only further expose the fascist face of this reactionary and decadent British imperialism, only further arouse the hatred of Hong Kong patriots towards British imperialism and their resolve to resist British fascism, and more broadly and deeply learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. Recently, hundreds of anti-British and anti-fascist small newspapers have appeared in Hong Kong. They expose the fascist crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities, boost the fighting spirit of patriots, and spread Mao Zedong Thought. This is a powerful response to the enemy and a great creation of Hong Kong compatriots. "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Hong Kong patriots will definitely produce more and better of these fighting newspapers, and give a devastating political blow to British imperialism!

	The statement sternly warns the Hong Kong British fascist authorities: all your "sentences" against Hong Kong patriotic journalists are absurd and completely invalid! The Hong Kong authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all detained Hong Kong patriotic journalists and compatriots, revoke the illegal "sentences" against the three patriotic newspapers, compensate for all damages, and severely punish the perpetrators.

    全国记协、《人民日报》、新华通讯社联合声明
    港英对我记者的非法“判决”完全无效
    港英必须立即释放我爱国新闻工作者和爱国同胞，撤销对三家爱国报纸的非法“判决”，赔偿损失，严惩肇事者
    据新华社十五日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会、《人民日报》、新华通讯社今天发表联合声明，最强烈地抗议港英法西斯当局非法“判决”新华社香港分社记者罗玉和以及《文汇报》、《大公报》、《香港商报》和《晶报》的四名记者入狱三年的法西斯暴行。声明强调指出，港英法西斯当局，无视我国政府和人民的多次抗议，继续变本加厉地迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者，这是对香港爱国同胞和伟大的中国人民的严重政治挑衅，是绝对不能容忍的。对此，我们提出最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，港英法西斯当局为了遏阻毛泽东思想的传播，扼杀香港爱国舆论，最近集中矛头，又一次向香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者发动了猖狂进攻。九月十三日，港英法西斯当局对非法扣押了四十五天并进行残酷迫害的新华社记者罗玉和、《文汇报》记者黄一溜、《大公报》记者王宁、《香港商报》记者陈子峰、《晶报》记者吴在城等五人，又悍然非法“判决”入狱三年。不仅如此，港英法西斯当局最近还非法逮捕了新华社香港分社工作人员李若文、梁淑荷，《大公报》工作人员张淑芬、邵干鎏，并派遣军警和特务对新华社香港分社和其他爱国新闻机构进行猖狂挑衅。
    声明指出，港英法西斯当局对香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者进行的大规模迫害，彻底撕破了它的“民主”、“自由”的假面具。它的罪恶目的就是妄图遏制我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的传播，妄图扑灭反英抗暴斗争的熊熊烈火。这完全是痴人作梦。光焰无际的毛泽东思想是遏制不了的，香港中国同胞热爱自己的祖国、热爱和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，是绝对不容侵犯的。香港爱国同胞懂得：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    敌人越害怕和反对宣传毛泽东思想，香港同胞就越要大张旗鼓地宣传、越要广泛地组织学习伟大的毛泽东思想。
    声明强调说，历史上任何企图扼杀革命舆论的反动派，都没有好下场。港英帝国主义在香港向爱国舆论界开刀，只能进一步暴露这个反动腐朽的英帝国主义的法西斯面目，只能更加激起香港爱国同胞对英帝国主义的仇恨和反英抗暴的决心，更加广泛深入地在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想。最近香港出现了数百种反英抗暴小报，它们大揭港英的法西斯罪行，大鼓爱国同胞的斗志，大讲毛泽东思想。这是对敌人的有力回击，是香港同胞的伟大创造。“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”香港爱国同胞一定会把这些战斗的小报办得更多更好，从政治上给港英帝国主义以毁灭性的打击！
    声明严重警告港英法西斯当局：你们对香港爱国新闻工作者的一切“判决”，都是荒谬的，完全无效的！港英当局必须立即无条件释放所有被捕的香港爱国新闻工作者和爱国同胞，撤销对三家爱国报纸的非法“判决”，赔偿一切损失，并严惩肇事者。
