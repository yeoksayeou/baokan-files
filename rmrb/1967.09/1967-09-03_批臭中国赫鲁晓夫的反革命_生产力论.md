Like the old revisionists, one of the weapons that the Chinese Khrushchev uses to oppose the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the counter-revolutionary "productive forces theory."

Now, let us examine the double act performed by the old revisionists and the Chinese Khrushchev:

Kautsky said in 1918: "The idea that a socialist economy can be built on the current basis of Russian agriculture is a fantasy." He also said that in a country where the productive forces are underdeveloped and the proletariat is in the minority, the conditions for a proletarian revolution "cannot mature."

After the victory of the October Revolution, Trotsky also vigorously advocated the reactionary "productive forces theory" and opposed the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union. He said: "We have not yet reached, nor even approached, the stage of building a socialist society... Socialism is only possible on the basis of developed and flourishing productive forces." He also said: "Only by making the productive forces of this isolated country surpass those of capitalism, can that new social form be consolidated not just for one or ten years, but for half a century or even a century."

The likes of Bukharin also vigorously promoted the "productive forces theory." Bukharin had a "witty" remark: "A little less administrative influence, more economic struggle, and more development of economic turnover." He also said that the transition from private capitalist economy to socialist planned economy "will be a long process." We should adopt an "open economic turnover" for a series of economic components, allowing them to promote each other and thus aid economic growth.

The Chinese Khrushchev regards the old revisionist "theories" as his bible. After the Chinese proletariat seized power, he used the excuse of backward industrial production to say that socialism is "premature" and is "a matter for the future." He vigorously advocated the "parallel development" and "mutual prosperity" of public and private economies.

In the 1920s, Bukharin used the excuse of underdeveloped productive forces to oppose the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union. He shouted: "If there is no increase in productive forces, then there is no question of so-called socialism," and that agricultural collectivization "is simply not possible." He advocated lifting "many restrictions" on rich peasants, "developing the economy of rich peasant households," and giving more freedom to the capitalist elements in the countryside.

In the 1950s, the Chinese Khrushchev also opposed the realization of agricultural cooperativization in our country, shouting that "if there is no development of industry and industrialization, agricultural collectivization is simply not possible." He also said that "prematurely" restricting rich peasants and implementing nationalization and collectivization would "hinder the development of productive forces." Therefore, he advocated the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style rich peasant economy and the long-term preservation of the rich peasant economy in the countryside.

Look, how similar the statements of the Chinese Khrushchev are to those of the old revisionists!

Great Lenin had long ago refuted this kind of outdated "theory" thoroughly. Lenin denounced the old revisionists, saying: "All their actions expose them as timid reformists, afraid to take a step away from the bourgeoisie, more afraid to break with the bourgeoisie."

Stalin also pointed out: The essence of Trotsky's fallacy is to pave the way for the establishment of a bourgeois democratic republic. Bukharin's fallacy is to lull the working class to sleep, disperse the working class, and facilitate the attack of capitalist elements on the Soviet power.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the unadulterated revisionist that Lenin and Stalin criticized.

After the proletariat won the democratic revolution, the question of whether or not and whether it is possible to immediately carry out a socialist revolution was answered affirmatively by Chairman Mao as early as 1939. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The growth of the proletariat and the Communist Party in the national political power structure, the nationalized economy and the cooperative economy of the laboring people in a democratic republic, all these are socialist factors. Coupled with the favorable international environment, it makes it possible for the final outcome of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution to avoid the capitalist future and realize the socialist future..."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, using the excuse of underdeveloped industry in our country, fiercely opposed the socialist revolution and advocated the vigorous development of capitalism. To develop capitalism, he shamelessly praised capitalist exploitation as having "not only no guilt but also merit." He said that if socialist steps were taken now, it would be "not in the interests of the people," would "injure the initiative of private industrialists and individual producers," and would "hinder the development of productive forces," and so on. According to his reactionary theory, it is only capitalism that can save China and promote the development of productive forces, while socialism is "hindering the development of productive forces"! This is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: The purpose of the socialist revolution is to liberate the productive forces. The transformation of agriculture and handicrafts from individual ownership to socialist collective ownership, and of private capitalist industry and commerce from capitalist ownership to socialist ownership, will necessarily greatly liberate the productive forces. This will create the social conditions for the great development of industrial and agricultural production. The facts of our country's socialist revolution have already proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "Only socialism can save China." The socialist revolution has liberated the productive forces of our country and promoted the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production.

It is clear that if we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy, we will not touch a hair of the old productive relations and superstructure, but will vigorously develop capitalism. In that case, even the productive forces that have just been liberated will be destroyed, and it will lead to the loss of power by the proletariat, the restoration of capitalism in China, and the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people will suffer twice the hardship, living a life worse than cattle.

It must be seen that this black cargo is not only a stumbling block for the Chinese revolution but also for the world revolution.

According to the teachings of the Chinese Khrushchev, if the productive forces are underdeveloped, socialist revolution cannot be carried out. Then, today's broad masses of people in the economically backward countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, should they not just submit to fate and endure the slavery and exploitation of imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the reactionaries of their own countries?

According to the teachings of the Chinese Khrushchev, countries with developed productive forces can "peacefully enter socialism." Then, the people of capitalist countries with "overproduction" also do not need to carry out a socialist revolution, and socialism can "peacefully" come!

This extremely reactionary "theory" must be thoroughly criticized! Otherwise, the proletariat will not be able to rise up, and the laboring people will not be able to be liberated!

History has mercilessly mocked these donkeys. World history has proven that the socialist revolution was not first successful in the capitalist countries of Europe with developed production, but in the Eastern countries with underdeveloped capitalist production.

Chairman Mao said: "When one is poor, one thinks of change, one wants to do, one wants revolution." Currently, the broad masses of people in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are enslaved and exploited, are rising up in revolution, resisting the rule of the old and new colonialism and the reactionaries of their own countries. This fact once again proves the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao, and also gives the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk another resounding slap in the face!

In a socialist society, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, should we insist on class struggle, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and promote production and construction through revolution; or should we abolish the socialist revolution, abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and devote ourselves to the so-called "economic construction"? This is the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and all revisionism, and it is also a focal point in the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line.

The fundamental question of all revolutions is the question of state power. After the proletariat seizes power, the entire transitional period is characterized by class struggle. The power of the overthrown bourgeoisie is still considerable, and they are always trying to restore power and overthrow the state power of the proletariat. At the same time, new bourgeois elements will emerge under socialist conditions, threatening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat over a long historical period. If the proletariat does not consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, then "technical revolution," "economic construction," "industrialization," "mechanization," and so on, are all empty talk.

However, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out and shouted that the main task of the Chinese people from now on is to "carry out socialist construction," to carry out "technical revolution," and to "create the material conditions for the transition to communism." The central task of the Party and the state is to "lead production" and "organize social life." In his view, what socialist revolution, what dictatorship of the proletariat, all are unnecessary, production is everything!

Revolution is the locomotive of history. Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. After the proletariat seizes state power, it must certainly engage in economic construction. However, only revolution can drive construction, and only by emphasizing politics can the economy be developed. The proletariat's economic construction is also entirely for the purpose of consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the revolution of the country and the world.

Lenin said: "The development of communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot go through any other path, because there is no other person and no other path that can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist class." This means that it is not possible, as all revisionists say, to reach communism through some "development of productive forces," "peaceful competition," "economic competition."

Lenin also emphasized: "Politics, compared to economics, cannot but occupy the first position. Not to affirm this is to forget the most basic common sense of Marxism." He also said: "If a class does not correctly handle political issues, it cannot maintain its rule, and thus cannot solve its production tasks."

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao developed Marxism-Leninism, solved the problems of the relationship between revolution and construction, class struggle and production struggle, political work and economic work under the dictatorship of the proletariat, solved the theoretical and practical problems of preventing the restoration of capitalism, and made the great and wise judgments that "politics is the commander, is the soul," "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," "grasp revolution, promote production," etc. This is a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism theory, and it is also the most thorough and powerful criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's "productive forces theory."

Based on the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, the work of our Party and state, no matter how complicated it may be, must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must carry out a thorough ideological revolution and a socialist revolution, and absolutely not bury our heads in business, focusing on the so-called "pure" economic construction, and falling into the quagmire of economism.

Indeed, a state under the dictatorship of the proletariat must develop the national economy at a high speed and establish a powerful material and technological foundation. However, our economic construction is fundamentally different from the "economic construction" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. His "economic construction" is to abolish the socialist revolution, abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restore capitalism, which is to oppose political leadership over business and allow capitalism to corrupt and disintegrate the socialist economic foundation.

The Chinese Khrushchev throws out the counter-revolutionary "productive forces theory" to oppose the socialist revolution. However, as the saying goes, all fools lift a stone to hit their own feet. The Cultural Revolution has sounded the alarm, announcing the failure of the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism. Let us wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly denounce the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary "productive forces theory"!

　　批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命“生产力论”
　　《首都红卫兵》报编辑部
    一
    同老修正主义者一样，中国赫鲁晓夫用来反对社会主义革命，反对无产阶级专政的武器之一，就是反革命的“生产力论”。
    现在，我们就来看看老修正主义者和中国赫鲁晓夫演出的这出双簧戏吧：
    考茨基在一九一八年说：“在目前俄国农业的基础上可以建立社会主义经济的说法是一种幻想。”他还说，在生产力不发达，无产阶级只占少数的一个国家中，无产阶级革命的条件是“不可能达到成熟的”。
    十月革命胜利以后，托洛茨基也极力鼓吹反动的“生产力论”，反对苏联进行社会主义革命。他说：“我们并没有达到甚至还没有走近建立社会主义社会的阶段……只有在生产力发展和繁荣的基础上，社会主义才是可能的。”他还说：“只有使这个孤立的国家的生产力超过资本主义的生产力”，“那种新的社会形态才会不止巩固一年或十年，而会巩固半世纪甚至一世纪。”
    布哈林之流也竭力宣扬“生产力论”。布哈林有一句“妙语”：“少加一点行政影响，多搞一点经济斗争，更多地发展经济周转。”他还说，从私人资本主义经济走向社会主义计划经济，“将是一个长时间的过程”。我们对一系列经济成分都要采取“开放的经济周转，使他们能够互相促进，从而有助于经济的增长”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫把老修正主义的“理论”奉为法宝。在中国无产阶级夺取政权以后，他借口工业生产落后，胡说什么社会主义“现在提得过早”，“是将来的事情”，工业“要发展到百分之四十，五十”，“才能搞社会主义革命”。他极力鼓吹公私经济“平行发展”、“互相繁荣”。
    二十世纪二十年代的布哈林，曾以生产力不发达为借口，反对苏联开展农业集体化运动。他叫嚣：“假如没有生产力的增长，那就根本谈不上所谓社会主义的问题”，农业集体化“简直没有可能”。他主张取消对富裕农民的“许多限制”，“发展富裕农户的经济”，“让农村的资产阶级分子有更多的活动的自由”。
    二十世纪五十年代的中国赫鲁晓夫，也反对我国实现农业合作化，大叫什么“如果没有工业的发展，不实现工业化，农业根本不可能实现集体化”。还说什么“过早地”限制富农，实行国有化、集体化，会“妨碍生产力的提高”。因此，他主张在农村发展“三马一犁一车”式的富农经济和长期保存富农经济。
    看，中国赫鲁晓夫的言论同老牌修正主义者的言论何其相似乃尔！
    伟大的列宁早已把这一类陈腐的“理论”驳得体无完肤了。列宁斥责老修正主义者说：“他们的一举一动都暴露出他们是些畏首畏尾的改良主义者，惟恐离开资产阶级一步，更怕跟资产阶级决裂”。
    斯大林也指出：托洛茨基谬论的实质，是为建立资产阶级民主共和国扫清道路。布哈林的谬论是麻痹工人阶级，涣散工人阶级，便利资本主义分子向苏维埃政权进攻。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫就是列宁和斯大林所抨击的不折不扣的修正主义者。
    二
    无产阶级取得了民主革命胜利以后，要不要和能不能立即进行社会主义革命，这个问题毛主席早就作了肯定的回答。
    毛主席在一九三九年就指出：“无产阶级和共产党在全国政治势力中的比重的增长”，“民主共和国的国营经济和劳动人民的合作经济”，“所有这一切，都是社会主义的因素。加以国际环境的有利，便使中国资产阶级民主革命的最后结果，避免资本主义的前途，实现社会主义的前途，……”
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫以我国工业不发达为借口，疯狂反对社会主义革命，主张大力发展资本主义。为了发展资本主义，他无耻地颂扬资本主义剥削“不仅没有罪恶，而且有功劳”。胡说什么“如果现在就采取社会主义步骤”，“对人民没有利益”，要“伤害私人工业家和个体生产者的积极性”，会“妨碍生产力的提高”等等。按照他的反动理论，就是只有资本主义才能够救中国，才能促进生产力的发展，而社会主义倒是“妨碍生产力的提高”了！这是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的背叛。
    毛主席说：社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力。农业和手工业由个体所有制变为社会主义的集体所有制，私营工商业由资本主义所有制变为社会主义所有制，必然使生产力大大地获得解放。这样就为大大地发展工业和农业的生产创造了社会条件。我国社会主义革命的事实已经证实了毛主席的英明论断：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”社会主义革命解放了我国的生产力，促进了我国工农业生产的突飞猛进的发展。
    很显然，如果我们按照中国赫鲁晓夫的主张去做，根本不去触动旧生产关系和上层建筑的一根毫毛，而是大力发展资本主义，那就连刚刚解放了的生产力也会遭到破坏，并且导致无产阶级丧失政权，资本主义在中国复辟，无产阶级和广大劳动人民重受二遍苦，过牛马不如的生活。
    必须看到，这套黑货，不仅是中国革命，而且是世界革命的绊脚石。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说教，生产力不发达就不能进行社会主义革命，那么，今天广大亚、非、拉经济落后国家的人民，不就只好听天由命，忍受帝国主义、新老殖民主义和本国反动派的奴役和剥削了吗？
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说教，生产力发达的国家就可以“和平进入社会主义”，那么，生产“过剩”的资本主义国家的人民，也就不需要进行社会主义革命了，社会主义可以“和平”地到来了！
    这种反动透顶的“理论”，必须彻底批判！否则，无产阶级就不能翻身，劳动人民就不能得到解放！
    历史无情地嘲弄了这班蠢驴。世界历史证明，社会主义革命不是首先在欧洲那些资本主义生产发达的国家成功，而是首先在东方那些资本主义生产不发达的国家成功。
    毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”目前，亚、非、拉广大地区被奴役被剥削的人民纷纷起来革命，反抗新老殖民主义和本国反动派的统治，这一事实再次证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断，也给了中国赫鲁晓夫之流又一记响亮的耳光！
    三
    在社会主义社会里，特别是在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，是坚持阶级斗争，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，以革命带动生产建设；还是取消社会主义革命，取消无产阶级专政，致力于单纯的“经济建设”？这是马克思列宁主义同一切修正主义的分水岭，也是毛主席的革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线斗争的一个焦点。
    一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题。无产阶级夺取政权以后，整个过渡时期都存在着阶级和阶级斗争。被推翻的资产阶级的力量还相当强大，他们时时企图复辟，妄图推翻无产阶级的国家政权。同时，在社会主义条件下还会产生新的资产阶级分子，威胁无产阶级专政。因此，就必须在一个很长的历史时期内巩固和强化无产阶级专政。无产阶级若不巩固和加强无产阶级专政，什么“技术革命”、“经济建设”、“工业化”、“机械化”，都是一句空话。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫在我国生产资料的社会主义改造基本完成以后，却跳出来大叫大嚷，说什么今后我国人民的主要任务就是“进行社会主义建设”，搞“技术革命”，“创造过渡到共产主义的物质条件”。党和国家的中心任务就是“领导生产”和“组织社会生活”。在他看来，什么社会主义革命，什么无产阶级专政，通通不要了，生产就是一切！
    革命是历史的火车头。政治是经济的集中表现。无产阶级掌握国家政权以后，固然要搞经济建设，但是，只有革命才能带动建设，只有突出政治才能发展经济。而无产阶级进行经济建设，也完全是为着巩固和加强无产阶级专政，为着本国的革命和世界的革命。
    列宁说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”这就是说，不能象一切修正主义者所说的那样，通过什么“发展生产力”、“和平竞赛”、“经济竞赛”的道路达到共产主义。
    列宁还强调指出：“政治同经济相比不能不占首位。不肯定这一点，就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。”又说：“一个阶级如果不从政治上正确地处理问题，就不能维持它的统治，因而也就不能解决它的生产任务。”
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政下革命和建设、阶级斗争和生产斗争、政治工作和经济工作的相互关系问题，解决了防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，作出了政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，“抓革命，促生产”等伟大的、英明的论断。这是对马克思列宁主义理论宝库的巨大贡献，也是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“生产力论”最彻底最有力的批判。
    根据毛主席的光辉思想，我们党和国家的工作，无论怎样千头万绪，都要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。要大搞人的思想革命化，大搞社会主义革命，而绝不能埋头业务，把注意力集中于所谓单纯的“经济建设”，陷入经济主义的泥坑。
    诚然，无产阶级专政的国家要高速度地发展国民经济，建立强大的物质技术基础。但是我们的经济建设同中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“经济建设”有着本质的不同。他的“经济建设”是取消社会主义革命，取消无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的“经济建设”，是反对政治统帅业务，任凭资本主义腐蚀和瓦解社会主义经济基础。
    中国赫鲁晓夫抛出反革命的“生产力论”，来反对社会主义革命，但是，象俗话中所说的一切蠢人一样，他搬起石头打了自己的脚。文化大革命一声炮响，宣告中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义阴谋的破产。让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命“生产力论”！
