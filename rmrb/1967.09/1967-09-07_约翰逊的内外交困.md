American imperialism, which is hostile to the American people and the people of the world, is now surrounded both by the people of various countries and by the American people. Whether abroad or at home, American imperialism has fallen into an unprecedentedly serious predicament and finds no way out.

The plight of the Johnson administration is so glaring that even American bourgeois newspapers find it hard to conceal.

They say that in the White House, "it seems as if the roof is about to cave in," "bad news is pouring in from all directions," "the accumulated problems are too numerous to count," and "later, more and more problems have no solutions."

They say that the Johnson administration is "simultaneously facing urgent domestic crises and urgent international crises," "turmoil is everywhere," and "the problems are so immense that they almost suffocate people."

This is indeed an admission by American imperialism of its domestic and foreign troubles and its encirclement.

The American imperialists have stretched their claws of aggression all over the world, which inevitably provokes the resistance of the people of various countries and makes the American bandits themselves fall into a situation where they are beaten everywhere. Currently, especially in Vietnam, 14 million people in South Vietnam have beaten this American giant to a pulp. The American aggressors have already deployed over 400,000 troops on this battlefield, yet they are defeated more and more miserably and are at their wits' end. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, more and more revolutionary people are taking up arms to strike at American imperialism and its lackeys. More Vietnams will definitely emerge in the world.

The more the American imperialists engage in external aggression, the more they will attack the American people and the more they will strengthen fascist rule and exploit the American people at home. The current Vietnam War has already become a bottomless pit consuming American manpower, resources, and finances. The American economy, which is already in deep crisis, is becoming increasingly perilous. The American authorities openly admit that there will be the highest fiscal deficit since World War II. Higher taxes, faster price increases, and more conscripts are all piled onto the American working people. This inevitably provokes the resistance of the American people. This year, strikes by workers in many industries in the United States have surged, and the scale of nationwide strikes in the first half of the year reached the highest level in 15 years, which is a manifestation of the growing resistance of the American working people.

In particular, since this summer, armed anti-violence struggles by African Americans have swept across more than 100 cities in the United States. African Americans have taken up arms and engaged in large-scale battles with American reactionary military police. The rapid momentum, broad scale, and intense nature of the African American struggle are unprecedented in American history over the past 100 years. The African Americans, who are at the bottom of American society, have become the vanguard of the American people's revolution. The rise of the African American struggle will inevitably promote the rise of the struggle of the American working people nationwide.

American imperialism is in dire straits both domestically and internationally, further exposing the great contradiction between its arrogant ambitions and its actual strength. The United States wants to dominate the world, but one battlefield in Vietnam has already bogged down a large number of American troops. The U.S. troops in Vietnam still need reinforcements from home, and the United States can only send 40,000 to 50,000 more troops by next June. At this very moment, the armed anti-violence struggles by African Americans erupting all over the United States have made the American reactionaries exhausted and overwhelmed. Just in the city of Detroit, nearly 20,000 troops were dispatched to suppress the struggle. The military strength that American imperialism relies on is so limited that it cannot cover everything, guard the head while neglecting the tail, and completely exposes its paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own doom. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the masses of the people in imperialist countries themselves is such a condition. Imperialism drives the masses of the people all over the world into the great struggle to eliminate imperialism in the historical era."

American imperialism's bullying and domination all over the world have produced the opposite result, which is to rapidly promote the awakening of the people of various countries in the world and the awakening of the American people. American imperialism's policy of aggression has linked the struggles of the people of various countries in the world with the struggles of the American people, mutually inspiring and supporting each other, forming an irresistible torrent. In the face of this revolutionary torrent, no matter how desperately American imperialism struggles to survive, and no matter how its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionists, helps it, it cannot save American imperialism from its doomed fate.

The people of the world and the American people should unite, continue to fight bravely, and definitely make the situation of American imperialism's domestic and foreign troubles more and more serious until its final downfall.

　　约翰逊的内外交困
　　新华社国际评论
    同美国人民和世界人民为敌的美帝国主义，现在既处在世界各国人民的包围中，又处在美国人民的包围中。无论是在国外，还是在国内，美帝国主义都陷入了空前严重的困境，并且找不到逃脱的方法。
    约翰逊政府的狼狈景况，连美国资产阶级报刊也难以掩饰。
    它们说，在白宫，“看来好象屋顶要塌下来了”，“坏消息从四面八方向政府涌来”，“累积起来的问题多得不得了”，“后来有越来越多的问题找不出解决办法”。
    它们说，约翰逊政府“同时面临紧迫的国内危机和紧迫的国际危机”，“到处是动乱”，“问题大得几乎把人压得透不过气来”。
    这确是美帝国主义内外交困，四面楚歌的自供状。
    美帝国主义者把侵略魔掌伸到世界各地，这就不能不激起各国人民的反抗，不能不使得美国强盗自己陷入到处挨打的境地。当前，特别是在越南，一千四百万越南南方人民就把美帝这个庞然大物打得焦头烂额。美国侵略者在这样一个战场上，投入的兵力已经增加到四十多万人，然而越败越惨，一筹莫展。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，越来越多的革命人民正在拿起枪杆子，来打击美帝国主义及其走狗。更多的越南，一定会在世界上出现。
    美帝国主义者越是对外侵略，就越要进攻美国人民，越要在国内加强法西斯统治，加紧压榨美国人民。当前一场侵越战争，已经成为消耗美国人力物力财力的无底洞。美国危机深重的经济更加险象丛生，美国当局公开承认要出现第二次世界大战以来财政赤字的最高纪录。更高的苛捐杂税，更快的物价上涨，更多的炮灰搜罗，种种重担一齐压向美国劳动人民。这样，也就不能不激起美国人民的反抗。今年美国许多行业工人罢工急剧上升，上半年全国罢工规模创十五年来的最高纪录，就是美国劳动人民反抗增长的一个表现。
    特别是今年夏天来，美国黑人武装抗暴斗争席卷全国一百多个城市。黑人拿起枪杆子，同美国反动军警展开大规模的搏斗。黑人斗争来势之迅猛，规模之广泛，程度之激烈，为近一百多年来美国历史上前所未有。处在美国社会最底层的黑人，成为美国人民革命的先锋。黑人斗争的高涨，不可避免地要促进美国全国劳动人民斗争的高涨。
    美帝国主义在国内外同时告急，更加暴露出它的狂妄野心和实际力量之间的极大矛盾。美帝要独霸世界，然而一个越南战场，已经陷进了美国大量兵力，侵越美军还不断要国内增兵，美国国内凑来凑去到明年六月以前才能增派四、五万人去。正在这个时候，美国国内到处爆发的黑人武装抗暴斗争，又弄得美国反动派疲于奔命，穷于应付。仅仅一个底特律城，就派遣了近两万军队前去镇压。美帝国主义所依仗的兵力就那末一点，顾了这顾不了那，防了脑袋防不了屁股，完全戳穿它一副外强中干的纸老虎原形。
    毛主席指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”
    美帝国主义在世界上到处横行霸道，造成一个相反的结果，这就是迅速地促进世界各国人民的觉悟和美国人民的觉悟。美帝国主义的侵略政策把世界各国人民的斗争同美国人民的斗争接连起来，互相鼓舞，互相支持，汇成一股不可阻挡的洪流。在这股革命的洪流面前，不管美帝怎样进行垂死的挣扎，也不管它的头号帮凶苏修怎样为它帮忙效劳，都挽救不了美帝国主义灭顶的命运。
    全世界人民同美国人民团结起来，再接再厉，英勇奋战，一定会使得美帝国主义内外交困的局面越来越严重，直至它最后灭亡。
