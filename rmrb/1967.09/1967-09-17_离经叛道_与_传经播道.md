Title: “Departing from the Canon and Rebelling Against the Doctrine” vs. “Transmitting and Spreading the Doctrine”

In 1959, China's Khrushchev's important agent in the literary and artistic circles, Xia Yan, once said in a ferocious manner: "Our current films are the old 'revolutionary canon' and 'warfare doctrine.' If we depart from this 'canon' and 'doctrine,' there will be nothing left." He blatantly proposed the theory of "departing from the canon and rebelling against the doctrine"!

The reason why Zhou Yang and his gang proposed "departing from the canon and rebelling against the doctrine" is to make our revolutionary literature and art depart from the canon of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and rebel against the doctrine of people's war; it is to oppose revolutionary literature and art depicting people's war, singing the praises of the revolutionary "gunpowder smell," and celebrating the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. For this purpose, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Tian Han shamelessly shouted: "Foreigners see our machine guns and cannons firing, and they get scared. If it's always cannons firing, they won't watch, they get annoyed.... We are used to it and don't find it strange, but they can't stand it, they get annoyed, they don't welcome it, and the play won't be watched." He shouted hoarsely: "Don't focus on making cannons," because it "involves our direction issue." Look! How deeply this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists hates works that depict revolutionary wars!

This is indeed a matter of direction, a matter of whether it is a revolutionary or counter-revolutionary direction. So, who is it that fears the sound of machine guns and cannons in people's wars? Who gets annoyed by it?

It is the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries. Because the machine guns and cannons of the revolutionary people will annihilate them all, so they are afraid, curse, and get annoyed!

It is the Soviet revisionist leadership. Because the machine guns and cannons of the revolutionary people have shattered their beautiful dream of US-Soviet cooperation to rule the world, so they are afraid, curse, and get annoyed!

It is the small clique within the party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road, along with their backer, China's Khrushchev. Because the machine guns and cannons of the revolutionary people have caused their plot to restore capitalism to suffer a shameful failure, so they are afraid, curse, and get annoyed!

As for the sound of machine guns and cannons in people's wars, the revolutionary people welcome it, love to hear it, and are happy about it. Because it is the sound of revolutionary guns and cannons, the sound of guns and cannons for the oppressed people to fight for liberation, the sound of guns and cannons to thoroughly bury imperialism and create a new world. Our revolutionary literature and art should write in big, bold letters about the sound of revolutionary guns and cannons, should sing with fervent enthusiasm about the revolutionary "gunpowder smell," should praise the immortal poems of people's wars, and should sing a thousand and ten thousand times about the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought around the world!

The reason why Zhou Yang and Xia Yan's gang proposed "departing from the canon and rebelling against the doctrine" is ultimately to realize China's Khrushchev's "transmitting and spreading the doctrine." This is to make our literature and art transmit the canon of revisionism and spread the doctrine of capitalism, to make revolutionary literature and art degenerate and actively peddle the revisionist line of "three surrenders and one destruction." For this purpose, they sing in harmony with Soviet Khrushchev, loudly advocating the revisionist fallacies of "pacifism" and "love for humanity." Khrushchev advocates "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition," and Zhou Yang says: "Pacifism is better than advocating war," slandering revolutionary literature and art that advocates Chairman Mao's people's war thought as "advocating war," attempting to oppose just wars under the pretext of opposing all wars, and extinguish the revolution of the people of the world. Khrushchev advocates "people are friends, comrades, and brothers," and Zhou Yang's gang advocates "love for humanity," slandering revolutionary literature and art that sings the praises of just wars as advocating "hatred for humanity," attempting to make us, like Khrushchev, hug and kiss, shake hands and make friends with the war-mongering American imperialists, cancel class struggle, and maintain the evil rule of the capitalist world.

What Zhou Yang and Xia Yan's gang "transmit and spread" is precisely what Soviet Khrushchev vigorously advocates. This is: no class struggle, no revolution, no armed seizure of power, no dictatorship of the proletariat. Regarding the revisionist black goods advocated by Khrushchev, China's Khrushchev has always been very appreciative. He instructed Zhou Yang and Xia Yan's gang: "Foreign things, if they can introduce the situation and help understand the situation, can be imported, and reformist things can also be imported." In 1959, after watching the ballet "The Little Mermaid," he slavishly praised the "expert" who "guided" the performance of the ballet as the "ancestor of Chinese dance art," and compared him to a "Buddha," encouraging him to "transmit and spread the doctrine" in China, that is, to transmit the canon of revisionism and spread the doctrine of capitalism in China, to realize his counter-revolutionary ambition of restoring capitalism.

This clearly tells us that the canon of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely indispensable, and the doctrine of people's war is absolutely not to be rebelled against. Chairman Mao's brilliant proposition of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an unshakable revolutionary truth. In China, if we depart from Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war, if we take the opportunist road of Chen Duxiu, if we let China's Khrushchev's "peaceful democratic new stage" succeed, it will be impossible to achieve victory in the revolution! In the world, if we depart from Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war, take the "parliamentary road" of the Italian and French Communist Parties, and engage in the "Nasakom" of Indonesia, it will also be impossible to achieve victory in the revolution.

Let the reactionary fallacy of "departing from the canon and rebelling against the doctrine" go to hell! Looking at the global situation, it will surely be a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought!

    “离经叛道”与“传经播道”	文晋军
    一九五九年，中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的一个重要代理人夏衍，曾经凶神恶煞地说：“我们现在的影片是老一套的‘革命经’、‘战争道’，离开了这一‘经’一‘道’，就没有东西。”明目张胆地提出了“离经叛道”论！
    周扬一伙所以提出“离经叛道”，就是要我们的革命文艺，离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之“经”，叛人民战争之“道”；就是反对革命文艺描写人民战争，歌颂革命的“火药味”，歌颂毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。为此，反革命修正主义分子田汉竟厚颜无耻地叫嚷道：外国人“看到我们机关枪、大炮响，他就害怕。老是大炮响，他就不看，他一看就恼火。……我们听惯了不以为奇，他就听不得，一听他就恼火，他不欢迎，戏就不看。”他声嘶力竭地叫嚣：“不要专门搞大炮这个东西”，因为它“涉及到我们的方向问题”。请看！这伙反革命修正主义分子对描写革命战争的作品，多么刻骨地仇恨！
    这确实是个方向问题，是涉及革命还是反革命的方向问题。那么，究竟是什么人害怕人民战争的机关枪、大炮响？是什么人一听就恼火呢？
    是帝国主义和各国反动派。因为革命人民的机关枪和大炮要把他们统统消灭干净，所以他们害怕、咒骂、恼火！
    是苏联修正主义领导集团。因为革命人民的机关枪和大炮，打破了美苏合作主宰世界的美梦，所以他们害怕、咒骂、恼火！
    是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其后台中国的赫鲁晓夫。因为革命人民的机关枪和大炮，使他们复辟资本主义的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败，所以他们害怕、咒骂、恼火！
    对于人民战争的机关枪、大炮声，革命人民则是欢迎得很，爱听得很，高兴得很。因为它是革命的枪炮声，是被压迫人民争取解放的枪炮声，是彻底埋葬帝国主义、创造新世界的枪炮声。我们的革命文艺就是要大写特写革命的枪炮声，就是要满腔热情地歌颂革命的“火药味”，就是要赞颂人民战争的不朽诗篇，就是要千遍万遍地讴歌毛泽东思想在全世界的伟大胜利！
    周扬、夏衍一伙所以提出“离经叛道”，归根到底是为了实现中国赫鲁晓夫的“传经播道”。这就是要我们的文艺传修正主义之“经”，播资本主义之“道”，就是要使革命文艺蜕化变质，积极兜售“三降一灭”的修正主义路线。为此，他们和苏联赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，大肆鼓吹“和平主义”和“人类之爱”等修正主义谬论。赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”，周扬就说：“和平主义比宣传战争好”，污蔑革命文艺宣传毛主席的人民战争思想是“宣传战争”，妄图在反对一切战争的幌子下，反对正义战争，扑灭世界人民的革命。赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“人与人是朋友、同志和兄弟”，周扬一伙就提倡“人类之爱”，污蔑革命文艺歌颂正义战争是宣传“人类之恨”，妄图要我们和赫鲁晓夫一样，去同美帝国主义战争贩子拥抱接吻，握手言欢，取消阶级斗争，维护资本主义世界的罪恶统治。
    周扬、夏衍一伙所“传播”的，也正是苏联赫鲁晓夫所极力鼓吹的。这就是：不要阶级斗争，不要革命，不要武装夺取政权，不要无产阶级专政。对于赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的修正主义黑货，中国的赫鲁晓夫向来是十分欣赏的。他指示周扬、夏衍一伙：“外国的东西，能介绍情况，帮助了解情况的，都可以进口，改良主义的也可以进口。”一九五九年，他在看了舞剧《鱼美人》之后，竟奴颜婢膝地把“指导”该剧演出的苏修“专家”吹捧为“中国舞蹈艺术的始祖”，并把他比作“佛”，鼓励他在中国“传经播道”，也就是在中国传修正主义之“经”，播资本主义之“道”，以实现其复辟资本主义的反革命野心。
    这就清楚地告诉我们，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之“经”是绝对离不得的，人民战争之“道”是绝对叛不得的。毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断，是颠扑不破的革命真理。在中国，如果离开了毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想，如果走陈独秀的机会主义道路，如果让中国赫鲁晓夫的“和平民主新阶段”得逞，要取得革命的胜利，那是永远不可能的！在全世界，如果离开了毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想，走意大利、法国共产党的“议会道路”，搞印尼的“纳沙贡”，要取得革命的胜利也是永远不可能的。
    让“离经叛道”的反动谬论见鬼去吧！放眼全球，必将是红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！
