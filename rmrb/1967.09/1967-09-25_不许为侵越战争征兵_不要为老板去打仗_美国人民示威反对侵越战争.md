	"No to Drafting for the Vietnam War" "Don't Fight for the Boss"
	American People Protest Against the Vietnam War

	Women Sing Anti-War Songs in Front of the White House

	On the 20th, approximately seven hundred women representatives from New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, and the states of Maryland, Oregon, and Washington gathered in Lafayette Square opposite the White House to hold a protest rally and demonstration. They strongly opposed the U.S. government's aggression in Vietnam and the draft, demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam. The protesters sang anti-war songs and broke through the police's heavy cordon to stage a sit-in demonstration at the White House gate. Before rushing to the White House, the women also held a demonstration march in front of the Washington draft office.

	Protest at McNamara

	On the 18th, when U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara delivered a speech in a hotel in San Francisco about the U.S. decision to establish an anti-missile system aimed at China, an American female youth stood up and faced this American warlord, shouting, "U.S. troops out of Vietnam immediately." At the same time, more than two hundred American youths demonstrated at the hotel entrance, shouting slogans such as "No to Drafting for the Vietnam War," "Don't Fight for the Boss," and "Fight the Boss Right Here."

	The Battlefield for American Blacks is in America

	On the 15th, American Black soldier Lockman held a press conference in Oakland, California, announcing his refusal to obey the order to go to Vietnam and condemning the U.S. aggression in Vietnam as "illegal and immoral." He said he would not be a "tool to suppress the Vietnamese people." His responsibility was not to fight in Vietnam but to fight in the slums of his hometown, Philadelphia.

　　“不许为侵越战争征兵”　“不要为老板去打仗”
　　美国人民示威反对侵越战争
　　白宫前妇女高唱反战歌
    二十日，来自纽约、费城、洛杉矶、华盛顿等大城市和马里兰、俄勒冈、华盛顿等州的约七百名美国妇女代表，在白宫对面的拉斐特广场举行抗议集会和示威，强烈反对美国政府的侵越战争和征兵，要求立即从南越撤回美军。示威者高唱反对侵越战争的歌曲，冲过警察的重重包围，在白宫大门口举行静坐示威。示威的妇女们在冲到白宫去以前，还在华盛顿征兵总局前面举行了示威游行。
      向麦克纳马拉示威
    十八日，当美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在旧金山的一个旅馆里，发表关于美国决定建立针对中国的反导弹系统的讲话时，一名美国女青年挺身而出，面对着这个美国强盗头目，高呼“美军立即撤出越南”。同时还有二百多名美国青年在旅馆的大门口举行示威，高呼“不许为侵越战争征兵”，“不要为老板去打仗”，“就在这里同老板斗争”等口号。
    美国黑人的战场在美国
    十五日，美国黑人士兵洛克曼在加利福尼亚州的奥克兰市举行记者招待会，宣布拒绝派他去越南打仗的命令，并且谴责美国侵越战争是“非法的和不道德的”。他说，他决不做“镇压越南人民的工具”，他的责任不是到越南去打仗，而是在他的家乡费城的贫民窟里战斗。　（新华社）
