The army loves the people, the people support the army, and the bonds between the military and civilians are as close as fish and water. In the new high tide of the movement to support the army and love the people, stories of the army loving the people, the people supporting the army, and the close bonds between the military and civilians are spreading everywhere.

Soldiers Donate Blood to Save a Young Revolutionary

On the afternoon of August 21st, in a hospital in Wuhan, a young revolutionary underwent chest surgery. In the evening, his blood pressure suddenly dropped, and he showed signs of severe internal bleeding. The doctors decided to perform a second surgery. The situation was extremely urgent, but the blood bank had run out of "AB" type blood.

At this critical moment, several dozen soldiers from the People's Liberation Army's 7212 Unit, who were on duty in the hospital, came to the door of the operating room. They all rolled up their sleeves and earnestly requested to donate blood to the young revolutionary. They said: "We are soldiers who fight side by side with the revolutionary young people. We must save our comrades with our own blood. Hurry! Hurry!"

The soldiers' sincere class feelings deeply moved the medical staff, who immediately began to check the blood types of the several dozen soldiers. At this moment, each soldier hoped so much that they were "AB" type. However, the test results showed that only three soldiers were of this blood type. Thus, the blood of three soldiers from the People's Liberation Army flowed into the veins of the revolutionary young person. This news spread quickly. Everyone said that this was not just the blood of three soldiers, but the deep class feelings of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army for the revolutionary masses.

Waves of a Thousand Li Reflect a Red Heart

Since the summer, the shipping department in Shanghai has been exceptionally busy. The East China Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy dispatched a batch of officers and soldiers to board some passenger ships, cargo ships, and oil tankers, working together with the revolutionary masses to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

The "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers No. 14" ship was fully loaded with passengers, sailing forward through the waves. Soldier Xiao Sunjian was working with the workers in the high-temperature boiler room. Xiao Sunjian, who had just boarded the ship, was not used to such an environment. His sweat was pouring down like rain, seasickness had made him vomit many times, and he had not eaten well for two days, but he still persisted. He saw the workers staring at the fiery furnace, with large beads of sweat dripping down but not having time to wipe them off. He thought: The workers dare to revolutionize and work hard, promote production with all their might, and are truly our good examples. Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army has an invincible spirit. It will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by them." He thought of this, and his whole body was filled with strength. He shoveled coal, swung the coal shovel, and added coal to the furnace. He had only one thought: to do more so that the workers could rest for a while.

When it was time to clean the furnace, Xiao Sunjian was again at the forefront. He pushed the small cart full of coal cinders and ran quickly. The ship swayed, and despite his best efforts, the cart was unmanageable. He fell, and the cart overturned. The workers all rushed over, urging him to rest for a while, but he smiled and said, "It's okay, don't mind me, hurry up and take out the cinders." He loaded the cinders into the cart and pushed it away again. The workers, looking at his back, said excitedly, "He is truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao, thinking of the people, doing the revolution, and sharing the same spirit with us revolutionaries."

"The Military-Civilian Friendship Room"

In front of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Factory, a new sentry post has been set up. There is a meaningful story behind this sentry post.

One noon, the sun was blazing, and there was not a breath of wind. Standing in the sun was like being in a steamer. Five Good Soldier Wang Yunhe was standing in the sun, guarding the factory gate.

His face was covered in sweat, and his clothes were soaked, but he was fully focused and steadfast in his position. Teams of "Steel Workers General Headquarters" and "Steel Workers Second Headquarters" passed by, all looking at him with respect and deep emotion. A few young revolutionaries from "Steel Workers Second Headquarters" kindly tried to pull Wang Yunhe to a shady spot. Wang Yunhe, however, said, "This is my battle position, and I cannot retreat!" The young revolutionaries hurriedly went to find the platoon leader, begging him to order the soldier to move to a shady spot. The platoon leader smiled and said, "I cannot give that order. Because it is a battle position, the soldier cannot leave." The young revolutionaries were deeply moved by these words. Finally, they decided to build a sentry post for their comrades.

They immediately got to work, finding wood, nails, and reed mats, working under the scorching sun. In no time, the sentry post was built. Everyone escorted Wang Yunhe into the sentry post. A soldier from "Steel Workers General Headquarters" said, "This is not just a sentry post, it is a military-civilian friendship room."

### 军爱民，民拥军，军民情谊鱼水亲

    军爱民，民拥军，军民情谊鱼水亲
    据新华社讯　在拥军爱民运动的新高潮中，到处流传着军爱民，民拥军，军民情谊鱼水亲的激动人心的故事。		战士献血救小将
    八月二十一日下午，在武汉一个医院里，一位革命小将做了胸部手术。晚上，突然血压降低，出现了严重的内出血症候。医生决定做第二次手术。情况十分紧急，但血库贮存的“AB”型血液用完了。
    就在这个关键时刻，在这个医院执行任务的人民解放军七二一二部队几十名战士来到手术室门口，一个个伸出胳膊，恳切地要求给小将输血。他们说：我们是和革命小将并肩战斗的战士，我们一定要以自己的鲜血救活我们的战友，快！快！
    战士真挚的阶级感情，深深地感动了医务人员，立即着手对几十名战士进行血型检查。这时，每一个战士是多么希望自己是“AB”型的血啊！可是，检验结果只有三名战士是这种血型的。就这样，三位解放军战士的鲜血流进了革命小将的血管里。这件事迅速传开了。大家说，这不仅是三个战士的鲜血，而是人民解放军指战员对无产阶级革命派的阶级深情。		万顷波涛映红心
    入夏以来，上海航运部门的任务空前繁忙。人民解放军海军东海舰队派出一批指战员登上一部分客轮、货轮和油船，同无产阶级革命派一起共挑革命、生产两副重担。
    “工农兵十四号”轮船满载着旅客破浪前进。解放军战士肖孙典正和工人们战斗在高温的锅炉舱里。上船不久的肖孙典很不适应这样的环境，他身上的汗水象下雨似的，晕船已经使他呕吐了好多次，两天没有很好吃饭了，但他还是坚持着。他看到工人们凝视着火红的炉膛，豆大的汗珠往下淌却顾不得擦一下，心想：工人们闹革命敢闯敢干，促生产猛冲猛打，真是我们的好榜样。毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”他想到这里，浑身充满了力量。他一会儿运煤，一会儿挥起煤锹，往炉膛里加煤。他只是一个念头：自己多干些，好让工人多休息一会儿。
    清炉膛的时候，肖孙典又是干在前头。他推着装满煤碴的小车呼呼地跑起来了。船不停地摇晃，尽管他使足力气，小车还是不听使唤，一个跟头，人滑倒了，车子也翻了。工人们都围上来，劝他休息一会儿，可他笑着说：“不要紧，不要管我，赶快出炉碴。”他把煤碴装进了车子，又推车跑开了。工人们看着他的背影激动地说：“真是毛主席的好战士，想的是人民，干的是革命，和我们革命派是一个脾气。”		“军民友谊室”
    在武汉重型机床厂的门前，新搭了一个哨棚。提起这个哨棚，有一段很有意义的故事。
    一天中午，烈日当空，没有一丝风，站在太阳底下，就象钻进了蒸笼。五好战士王运和顶着火热的太阳，正在厂门口值勤。
    他脸上汗水直淌，衣服全湿透了，但他却全神贯注，坚守在自己的岗位上。一队队“钢工总”、“钢二司”的战士从这里经过，都用敬佩的眼光看着他，心里异常激动。“钢二司”的几个革命小将，好心地将王运和往荫凉地方拉。王运和却说：“这里就是我的战斗岗位，我不能随便退后啊！”小将们又急忙去找指导员，恳求他下令，让战士换个荫凉处。指导员笑着说：“我可不能下这个命令。因为是战斗岗位，战士不能离开。”小将们听了这一席话，十分感动。最后，他们决定给亲人们搭一个哨棚。
    说干就干，一齐动手，有的找木料，有的找钉子，有的找芦席，顶着烈日干起来了。不一会儿，哨棚就搭好了。大家把王运和拥进了哨棚。“钢工总”一位战士说：“这不是哨棚，这是军民友谊室”。
