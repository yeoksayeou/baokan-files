The boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, the two major factions in our Beijing Cotton Mill No. 3 swiftly achieved revolutionary unity with the spirit of "seizing the day."

Due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and petty-bourgeois factionalism, our factory workers were split into two major factions over a period of time, constantly engaging in "internal warfare," which seriously affected the revolution and production. The majority of revolutionary workers were very dissatisfied with this situation and eagerly hoped to unite. Just at this time, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

Chairman Mao's words struck a chord in our hearts. Reflecting calmly, we are all class brothers and sisters, working, studying, and making revolution together. How could there be fundamental conflicts of interest? There are none, absolutely none. We have no reason to be irreconcilable. On the morning of September 19, one organization first proposed the initiative for unity and organized the masses to drum and beat gongs to deliver the proposal to the other organization. In the afternoon, the other side issued a statement supporting unity and also organized the masses to deliver the good news to the other side. The two teams merged, and many people were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. Warm hands tightly clasped each other, and everyone together shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Some of the masses sighed, "We have been fighting 'internal wars' for a year, fighting against ourselves, but actually there is nothing significant between us!"

Over the past year, the leaders of the two factions did not speak to each other when they met. Now, for the first time, they sat together with the spirit of equal consultation to discuss the grand plan for revolutionary unity. A leader of one organization humorously said, "In the past, we did not speak when we met. Now, talking for a day and a night is not too much!" Both sides spoke openly and sincerely, using the highest directive as the standard, and reached an agreement on unity relatively smoothly. They decided to discard the original names of the two factions and establish a new organization—the Beijing Cotton Mill No. 3 Revolutionary Masses Unity Committee.

　　没有理由“势不两立”
　　北京棉纺三厂无产阶级革命派大联合委员会
    毛泽东思想威力无穷。我们京棉三厂两大派组织，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，以“只争朝夕”的精神，迅速地实现了革命的大联合。
    由于资产阶级反动路线和小资产阶级派性的影响，我厂职工在过去的一段时间里分裂成了两大派，“内战”打个不停，严重地影响了抓革命，促生产。大多数革命职工对这种情况十分不满，迫切地希望联合起来。正在这时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
    毛主席的话，句句说在我们的心坎上。冷静地想一想，我们本来都是亲如手足的阶级兄弟和阶级姐妹，在一起工作、一起学习、一起闹革命，哪有什么根本利害冲突？没有，根本没有。我们没有什么理由
  “势不两立”。九月十九日早晨，有一个组织首先提出大联合的倡议，并组织群众敲锣打鼓把倡议书送到另一个组织去；下午，对方就发表了支持大联合的声明，也组织群众把喜报送到对方去。两支队伍汇合在一起，许多人激动得热泪盈眶，一双双热情的手紧紧地握在一起，大家共同高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”有的群众感慨地说：“我们打了一年的‘内战’，自己打自己，其实互相之间并没有什么了不起的事情！”
    一年来，两派的负责人见面都不说话，现在第一次以平等协商的精神坐在一起，共同商讨革命大联合的大计。有一个组织的负责人风趣地说：“过去我们见面不说话，现在我们谈一天一夜也不算多啊！”双方开诚相见，以最高指示为准则，比较顺利地达成了大联合的协议，决定把两大派原来的组织名称抛开，成立新的组织——京棉三厂无产阶级革命派大联合委员会。
