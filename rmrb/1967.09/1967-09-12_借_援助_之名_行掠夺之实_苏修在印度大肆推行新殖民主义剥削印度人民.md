Over the past decade, the Soviet revisionist leadership has poured vast amounts of economic and military "aid" into India, buying off and propping up Indian reactionaries, and exploiting the Indian people. Now, the Soviet revisionists' plunder in India is second only to that of American and British imperialism. They have become India's second-largest creditor, the largest supplier of military "aid," and the third-largest trading partner.

The Soviet revisionists' method of plundering India through "aid" is first and foremost to control India's key economic sectors. To date, the total amount of Soviet "economic aid" to India has reached $135 million, all of which is concentrated in the heavy industry sectors controlled by Indian bureaucratic capital. In these "aid" projects, the Soviets have consistently monopolized engineering design, the supply of machinery and equipment, and parts, and have meddled in operational management. This has placed a significant portion of India's heavy industry, including a quarter of steel smelting, half of oil refining, and a fifth of electricity, under Soviet control. Take the Bokaro Steel Plant currently under construction, for example. The Soviet side not only excluded Indians from the design process but also demanded full control during the construction period. The Indian people are extremely indignant about this.

Like imperialists, the Soviet revisionists use "aid" to drive commercial exports and dump inferior goods in India at high prices. They stipulate that loans given to India must be used 100% to purchase goods from the Soviet Union. The price of Soviet "aid" equipment is usually 20% to 30% higher than the world market price. Under the Soviet dumping policy, inferior Soviet-made equipment and parts are rampant in India. According to a report published by the Indian Parliament's Public Enterprises Committee in 1966, the value of Soviet-made parts stockpiled at the Bhilai Steel Plant in 1964 was 15.7 million rupees. The efficiency of the 37 Soviet-made diesel locomotives used by this plant is very low, and maintenance costs are five times higher than normal. According to a letter to the editor published in the Indian Economic Times, "The refractory materials dumped by the Soviet Union in the Bhilai Steel Plant are of very poor quality, consuming 20 kilograms per ton of steel produced, which is one to three times more than in Soviet and American steel plants." "In the Ranchi Heavy Machinery Plant, the Soviet Union, under the guise of 'repair parts,' has dumped enough refractory materials for five years of use."

The Soviet revisionists also engage in disguised usury through "aid." All Soviet "aid" to India is in the form of loans. According to the Indian Economic Times, although the nominal interest rate on Soviet loans is only 2.5%, "the high interest rate is hidden in the high prices of the goods provided," essentially a form of "hidden usury." Moreover, the loan terms are very short, with repayment starting one year after the equipment arrives, to be repaid in full within 12 years. Currently, India needs to repay an average of 350 million rupees in Soviet "aid" principal and interest each year.

At the same time, the Soviet revisionists use barter trade to create a serious dependence of Indian trade on the Soviet market. Currently, a portion of India's exports is heavily dependent on the Soviet market, including 75% of wool exports, 57% of leather, and 35% of tobacco. To solidify this market dependence, when renewing the two countries' five-year trade agreement in 1966, the Soviet revisionists also stipulated that each country would establish factories to produce goods specifically for export to the other. The Indian magazine Habimana said that these factories would face great "risks" because "if the Soviet Union changes its mind, these goods will not be sold."

In addition, the Soviet revisionists use "aid" to demand various privileges, infringing on Indian national interests. In 1964, when India requested that the Soviet revisionists provide shrimp-catching equipment and technology, the Soviet revisionists demanded the use of Indian ports in exchange. As a result, the Indian reactionary government agreed to provide the Soviet revisionists with the following conveniences: (1) using Indian ports to unload fish from fishing boats onto refrigerated ships; (2) repairing Soviet ships and equipment in Indian ports; (3) providing fresh water and fuel for Soviet ships. The Indian Economic Situation Monthly Review said, "The Russians obtaining these conveniences will drive India out of the global fish and shrimp market."

According to a report by the British Scotsman, the Soviet revisionists, who have consistently failed to honor trade agreements, also secretly sold certain goods imported from India, such as tea, sacks, and cashews, to the West to earn foreign exchange, causing India to suffer foreign exchange losses.

It is worth noting that in recent years, the Soviet revisionists have attempted to collude with Indian private monopolies, using India as a base for their economic expansion into Asia and Africa. Like imperialists, the Soviet revisionists aim to use India's cheap labor, technology, and raw materials to invest in factories in India, producing goods for export to some Asian and African countries. In May 1965, during a visit to the Soviet Union by former Indian Prime Minister Shastri, the Soviet leadership formally proposed establishing joint ventures with Indian private capital in India, initially producing goods needed by both sides, "and then turning to exports to third countries." Currently, the Indian government is reviewing the Soviet revisionists' application to establish a joint venture with Indian private capital to produce a watch factory and a vehicle factory. The Indian big bourgeoisie's mouthpiece, the Indian Express, commented: "From the Soviet point of view, using India as a base to provide materials to Asian countries can reduce transportation costs, ease the burden on Soviet domestic industry, and pave the way for a more ambitious Southeast Asian policy for the Soviet Union"; while for India, it can also "exert a large-scale influence in Asia and Africa."

Because both the United States and the Soviet Union have a demand to jointly control India and use Indian reactionaries to counter China, the U.S. imperialists have enthusiastically endorsed the Soviet revisionists' aforementioned actions. U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Harriman publicly stated: "The Soviet Union's continued aid to India is in the interest of the United States." The director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Bell, also publicly advocated for a "U.S.-Soviet joint aid to India plan."

However, the broad masses of the Indian people are increasingly recognizing the neo-colonialist face of the Soviet revisionists. They are determined to overthrow this mountain pressing down on them. They are exposing that Soviet "aid" and American "aid" are of the same ilk, aimed at "establishing a controlling position in the Indian economy," which "harms India's national interests and prestige." They also point out that the Soviet revisionists, through "aid," "have helped the Indian bourgeoisie and landlord class strengthen their rule," oppressing and exploiting the Indian people.

### 借“援助”之名　行掠夺之实  苏修在印度大肆推行新殖民主义剥削印度人民

    借“援助”之名　行掠夺之实
    苏修在印度大肆推行新殖民主义剥削印度人民
    据新华社十日讯　本社记者报道：十年来，苏联修正主义领导集团在印度倾注了大量经济“援助”和军事“援助”，收买和扶植印度反动派，剥削印度人民。现在，苏修在印度掠夺的规模仅次于美英帝国主义，已经成为印度的第二大债权国、最大的军“援”供应国和第三位贸易国。
    苏修通过“援助”对印度进行掠夺的做法，首先是控制印度经济的要害部门。迄今，苏修对印度经“援”总数已达十三亿五千万美元，全部集中在印度官僚资本控制的重工业部门。它在“援助”工程中，一贯垄断工程设计，垄断机器装备和零件的供应，并插手经营管理。这样，就使印度相当大一部分重工业，包括钢铁冶炼的四分之一、石油提炼的二分之一和电力的五分之一，处于苏修的控制之下。以正在兴建的波卡罗钢厂为例，苏方不仅排斥印度人参加设计，而且要求在建厂期间取得全部控制权。印度人民对此十分愤慨。
    苏修同帝国主义一样用“援助”带动商品输出，在印度高价倾销劣质商品。它规定给印度的贷款必须百分之百地用于在苏采购。苏“援”装备的价格，通常比世界市场价格高百分之二十到三十。在苏修的倾销政策下，苏制劣质装备和零件在印度泛滥成灾。据一九六六年印度议会公营企业委员会发表的报告透露，比莱钢厂在一九六四年积压的苏制零件，价值一千五百七十万卢比；这个厂所用的三十七辆苏制柴油机车效率很低，维修费用竟比正常的高出五倍。另据印度《经济时报》刊登的一封读者来信说，“苏联在比莱钢厂倾销的耐火材料质量极差，每生产一吨钢就需消耗二十公斤，比苏美本国钢厂多消耗一倍至三倍”。“苏联在兰契重型机器厂以‘维修零件’名义，倾销了足以使用五年的耐火材料”。
    苏修还通过“援助”进行变相的高利贷剥削。苏修对印度的“援助”全部是贷款。据印度《经济时报》透露，虽然苏联贷款的利率在名义上只有百分之二点五，但它的“高利率被隐藏在所提供货物的高价中”，实质上是一种“隐蔽的高利贷”。而且贷款期限很短，在装备运到一年后就要开始偿还，十二年还清。目前印度需要偿还的苏“援”本息平均每年已达到三亿五千万卢比。
    同时，苏修又用以货易货的贸易方式造成印度贸易对苏联市场的严重依赖。目前印度出口商品已有一部分严重依赖苏联市场，包括毛织品出口的百分之七十五、皮革的百分之五十七、烟草的百分之三十五。苏修为使这种市场依赖关系固定下来，在一九六六年续订两国五年贸易协定时，还规定两国各设立工厂，专门生产输往对方的商品。印度《习明纳尔》杂志说，这类工厂将冒很大“风险”，因为“一旦苏联改变主意，这些商品就会卖不出去”。
    此外，苏修还利用“援助”索取种种特权，侵犯印度民族利益。一九六四年印度要求苏修提供捕虾设备和技术，苏修便以要求使用印度港口为交换条件。结果印度反动政府同意给苏修下列便利：（1）使用印度港口把捕鱼船上的鱼卸到冷藏船上；（2）在印度港口维修苏联船只和设备；（3）为苏联船只提供淡水和燃料。印度《经济情况每月评论》说，“俄国人得到这些便利将把印度排挤出世界鱼虾市场”。
    另据英国《苏格兰人报》报道，一贯不守贸易信用的苏修，还把某些从印度进口的商品如茶叶、麻袋、腰果等暗地向西方抛售，赚取外汇，使印度蒙受外汇损失。
    值得注意的是，近年来苏修还企图同印度私人垄断资本相勾结，利用印度作为它向亚非地区进行经济扩张的基地。苏修同帝国主义一样，企图利用印度的廉价劳动力、技术和原料，在印度投资设厂，生产商品向一些亚非国家输出。一九六五年五月，印度政府前总理夏斯特里访问苏联时，苏修领导就曾正式建议同印度私人资本在印度建立合营企业，最初生产双方需要的商品，“将来转向对第三国出口”。现在印度政府正在审批苏修提出的同印度私人资本合营一家钟表厂和一家车辆厂的申请。对此，印度大资产阶级的喉舌《印度快报》评论说：“从苏联的观点看，以印度为基地向亚洲国家提供物资，可以减少运费、减轻苏联国内工业的负担，并为苏联推行更加野心勃勃的东南亚政策开辟道路”；而对印度来说，也可借此在亚非地区“大规模地发挥影响”。
    由于美、苏都有联合控制印度和利用印度反动派反华的要求，美帝对苏修上述种种行径大加喝采。美国无任所大使哈里曼就公开声称：“苏联继续援助印度是符合美国利益的”。美国国际开发署署长贝尔也公开鼓吹要搞“美苏联合援印计划”。
    但是，印度广大人民越来越认清了苏修的新殖民主义面目。他们决心要推翻这座压在他们头上的大山。他们纷纷揭露苏“援”和美“援”是一路货，是为了“在印度经济中建立控制地位”，它“损害了印度的民族利益和威望”。他们还指出，苏修通过“援助”，“帮助了印度资产阶级和地主阶级加强他们的统治”，压迫和剥削印度人民。
