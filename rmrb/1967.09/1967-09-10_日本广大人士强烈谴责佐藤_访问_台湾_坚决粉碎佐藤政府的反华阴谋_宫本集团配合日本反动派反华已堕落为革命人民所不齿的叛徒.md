Japanese mass organizations and prominent figures from various circles have expressed strong condemnation to Xinhua News Agency correspondents regarding Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan and his collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to plot further anti-China schemes, aiming to undermine the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

On the 5th, Miyazaki Seiken, Chairman of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), stated that since Sato Eisaku came to power three years ago, he has consistently been hostile towards China, undermining the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. Now, he personally visits Taiwan to openly collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, revealing once again his role as a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, an enemy of the Chinese people, and a reactionary face of the "Two Chinas" plot.

Miyazaki emphasized that the awakened broad masses of the Japanese people firmly oppose being pushed back onto the path of aggressive war against China and resolutely stand with the Chinese people in unity and friendship, opposing the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. If the Sato government dares to persist, it will meet an even more tragic fate than Kishi Nobusuke.

In his remarks, Nakajima Takeshiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, stressed that Sato's "visit" to Taiwan is a wanton destruction of the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, a heinous crime against the peoples of both countries. Nakajima pointed out that the Sato government is driving the Japanese people to serve the bloody war policies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and it will inevitably reap what it sows. The Sato government's days are numbered.

On the 6th, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Chairman of the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, stated that Sato's "visit" to Taiwan, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with Chiang Kai-shek, who has long been spurned by the Chinese people, shows that the Sato government is a watchdog of U.S. imperialism in Asia. Sakamoto emphasized that the Japanese people must unite with the Chinese people, who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with the Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression, and with all the peoples of Asia and Africa who are struggling for national independence and liberation. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and march forward to victory on the path of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

Kobayashi Yuichi, Chairman of the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers' Unions, stated that the broad masses of the Japanese people firmly oppose Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan and his so-called "friendship" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Kobayashi exposed that the Sato government harbors political, military, and economic ambitions towards Taiwan. It schemes to control Taiwan, turning it back into a Japanese colony, and foolishly dreams of reviving the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Kobayashi emphasized that the world situation has undergone tremendous changes. China has become a revolutionary base for the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. The broad masses of the Japanese people firmly oppose Japanese militarism invading China again. No matter what deals Sato makes with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Japanese people will resolutely smash them.

Hagiwara Sadashi, Executive Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, pointed out that Sato's "visit" to Taiwan is in accordance with the instructions of the American master, attempting to resist the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which inspires the oppressed peoples of Asia, and further to unite with the reactionary forces of India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, and "Malaysia" to jointly oppose China, helping the U.S. to suppress the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia, serving the reactionary purpose of Japanese militarism to reoccupy Southeast Asia.

Hagiwara emphasized that while the Sato government is frenziedly hostile towards China, destroying Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, the Japanese revisionist group led by Miyamoto Kenji actively collaborates with the Japanese reactionaries, fiercely slandering and attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, and madly defaming the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world. This proves that the Japanese revisionist group led by Miyamoto Kenji has degenerated into a traitor despised by revolutionary people.

Japanese famous commentator Shiraishi Bampo pointed out that Sato, disregarding the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, insists on colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, showing that he is the most active follower of U.S. imperialism's policy of "containing China," anti-China, and anti-communism.

Japanese famous trade union leader Takano Minoru said that Sato's activities in Taiwan are a serious step for the Japanese government to further follow U.S. imperialism in implementing a policy of hostility towards China and expansionism. Takano said that today, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved brilliant victories, and the revolutionary armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are raging. The Japanese people are making a big fuss against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Famous women's activist Nakajima Chiyo said that Sato's "visit" to Taiwan and his preparations to go to South Vietnam are part of the combined actions of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries against China. She said that Japanese women cherish the friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China, and Japanese women are determined to fight against all enemies that destroy Sino-Japanese friendship.

Japanese religious figure Nishikawa Keifu said that Taiwan has been a sacred and inviolable territory of China since ancient times. Sato Eisaku, acting on behalf of U.S. imperialism, engages in activities in Taiwan, which is a serious challenge to the Chinese people and a serious challenge to the Japanese people who seek unity and friendship with the Chinese people. Nishikawa said that the Japanese reactionary forces, attempting to profit from the fires of war ignited by U.S. imperialism, will not end well.

　　日本广大人士强烈谴责佐藤“访问”台湾
　　坚决粉碎佐藤政府的反华阴谋
　　宫本集团配合日本反动派反华已堕落为革命人民所不齿的叛徒
    据新华社东京电　日本群众团体负责人和各界知名人士纷纷向新华社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责美帝国主义的忠实走卒日本首相佐藤荣作“访问”台湾，与蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结，策划进一步敌视中国和破坏日中两国人民友好的新的反华阴谋。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民五日说，佐藤荣作上台三年以来，一贯敌视中国，破坏日中两国人民友好，现在又亲自去台湾与蒋介石匪帮公开勾结，这是他甘心充当美帝反华走卒，与中国人民为敌，制造“两个中国”的反动面目的又一次大暴露。
    宫崎强调指出，已经觉醒了的日本广大人民，坚决反对再一次把日本推向以中国为敌的侵略战争的道路，坚决要同中国人民团结友好，反对共同敌人美帝国主义。佐藤政府如果胆敢一意孤行，它必定遭到比岸信介更加悲惨的命运。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏在谈话中强调指出，佐藤“访问”台湾，是对日中两国人民的友谊的疯狂破坏，是对日中两国人民犯下的滔天罪行。中岛指出，佐藤政府驱使日本人民为美日反动派的血腥的战争政策卖命，它必将自食其果，佐藤政府的寿命是长不了的。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松六日说，佐藤这次“访问”台湾，同早已被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石握手言欢，这表明佐藤政府是美帝国主义在亚洲的一条看家狗。坂本强调说，日本人民要同在毛主席领导下进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民，同与美帝国主义的侵略进行斗争的越南人民以及同一切为争取民族独立与解放而斗争的亚非各国人民团结起来，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在反帝反修的大道上胜利前进。
    日本记者同盟主席小林雄一说，日本广大人民坚决反对佐藤荣作“访问”台湾并同蒋介石集团搞什么“亲善”。
    小林揭露，佐藤政府在政治上、军事上和经济上对台湾抱有野心。它阴谋染指台湾，把台湾再度变成日本的殖民地，妄图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。
    小林强调指出，今天的世界形势已经发生了巨大变化。中国已经成为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界人民的革命根据地，日本广大人民坚决反对日本军国主义再度侵略中国。不管佐藤同蒋介石集团做成什么交易，日本人民都将坚决予以粉碎。
    日本国际贸易促进会专务理事萩原定司指出，佐藤“访问”台湾，是秉承美国主子的意旨，妄图抵制取得决定性胜利的中国无产阶级文化大革命对亚洲被压迫人民的鼓舞和影响，并进而联合印度、印尼、缅甸、泰国、“马来西亚”等反动势力共同反华，帮助美帝镇压东南亚的民族解放运动，为日本军国主义势力再次霸占东南亚的反动目的服务。
    萩原强调说，在佐藤政府猖狂敌视中国、破坏日中友好和日中贸易的时候，日修宫本集团积极配合日本反动派，大肆污蔑和攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，疯狂诋毁震撼全世界的无产阶级文化大革命。这就证明了日修宫本集团已经堕落为革命人民所不齿的叛徒。
    日本著名评论家白石凡指出，佐藤不顾广大日本人民的强烈反对，硬要同蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结，表明他最积极地追随美帝国主义的“遏制中国”、反华、反共的政策。
    日本著名工会领导人高野实说，佐藤去台湾活动，是日本政府进一步追随美帝国主义推行敌视中国政策、实行扩张主义的一个严重步骤。高野说，今天，毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着全世界，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌胜利，亚非拉人民的革命武装斗争烽火四起，日本人民正在大造帝修反的反。
    著名妇女活动家中岛千代说，佐藤“访问”台湾和准备去南越，就是帝、修、反反华联合行动的一个组成部分。她说，日本妇女最珍视日中两国人民的友好和团结，日本妇女决心同破坏日中友好的一切敌人进行斗争。
    日本宗教界知名人士西川景文说，台湾自古以来就是中国的神圣不可侵犯的领土。佐藤荣作秉承美帝意旨到台湾活动，这是对中国人民的严重挑战，是对要求与中国人民团结友好的日本人民的严重挑战。西川说，日本反动势力妄图在美帝发动的侵略战争中火中取栗，决不会有好下场。
