Chinese Journalists Delegation Arrives in Hanoi

According to the 1967 execution plan of the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Vietnam, a delegation of Chinese journalists led by Guo Longchun, a reporter from the People's Daily, recently arrived in Hanoi for a friendly visit.

North Vietnamese Military and Civilians Shoot Down Six U.S. Aircraft

Military and civilians in the northern regions of Vietnam, including Hon Market, Ha Tinh, Quang Ninh, and Quang Binh, shot down six invading U.S. aircraft in four days of counterattacks against U.S. air pirates on September 7, 8, 10, and 11.

Lao Patriotic Forces Achieve Major Victories

According to broadcasts from the Pathet Lao radio station, the patriotic military and civilians in the Nambo region of Luang Prabang Province in Laos have achieved significant victories in the initial three months of the rainy season this year (from June to August).

The report states that, according to incomplete statistics, the patriotic military and civilians in the Nambo region conducted 95 battles during this period, eliminating 912 enemy personnel. They also shot down or destroyed 13 enemy aircraft, damaged 11, sank 16 motorboats and ships, and seized 170 various types of weapons.

Additionally, the radio station reported that the guerrilla forces and armed people's forces in the Phalawi region of Vientiane Province in Laos eliminated 152 enemy personnel from July to August during anti-sweeping operations.

Pathet Lao Radio Condemns U.S. and Thai Reactionary Atrocities

The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary on September 11, strongly condemning the fascist crimes of the U.S. imperialist puppet regime of Thanom-Kittikachorn in Thailand, which plotted to kill Thai patriots.

The commentary stated that on August 31, the Thanom-Kittikachorn puppet regime arrested dozens of Thai patriots. On September 4, Thanom publicly declared at a press conference that he would kill these patriots.

The commentary said that the Thanom-Kittikachorn puppet regime's insane and barbaric actions are serious steps against the Thai people, openly and blatantly trampling on the freedom, democracy, and human rights of the Thai people.

The commentary expressed that the Lao people firmly support the urgent appeal issued by the Thai Patriotic Front on September 5 to all Thai people and revolutionary people around the world: to take decisive actions, strongly protest, and oppose the fascist atrocities of U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Kittikachorn puppet regime.

British Railway Workers' Strike Expands

Due to the expansion of the railway workers' strike, over 500 passenger and freight trains were halted in various parts of Britain on September 13.

The strike began a few days earlier in the Manchester area, sparked by the railway authorities' refusal to pay freight train workers their due overtime pay and their intention to fire workers who refused overtime and those who supported the strike.

The strike quickly spread, with some signalmen also joining.

U.S. Troops in West Germany Continue to Commit Atrocities

U.S. troops stationed in West Germany have been acting arrogantly and committing atrocities, increasingly provoking the anger of West German residents. Reports indicate that a U.S. sergeant shot and killed a West German resident in Stuttgart. The U.S. military court used various excuses to defend the culprit and recently acquitted him. The West German public strongly opposes this unreasonable verdict.

In late July in the U.S.-occupied area of Frankfurt, two U.S. soldiers beat a West German resident and then threw him into a river, drowning him.
