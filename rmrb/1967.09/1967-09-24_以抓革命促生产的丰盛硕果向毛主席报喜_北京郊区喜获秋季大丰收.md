The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing have defeated the sabotage attempts of a small handful of class enemies and overcome various natural disasters, achieving a bumper harvest of corn, millet, rice, and oil crops.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have defeated the sabotage attempts of a small handful of class enemies and overcome wind, hail, and pest disasters. Following the summer harvest, they have achieved another bumper autumn harvest.

Currently, the vast fields of the suburbs of Beijing are fully engaged in autumn harvests, and the news of a bumper harvest is spreading everywhere. From the current situation of threshing and drying the crops that have been harvested, the main crops such as corn, millet, rice, and oilseeds are all bumper harvests. According to preliminary estimates from relevant departments, the total grain output this year will see a significant increase. Many old farmers, seeing the bumper harvest, joyfully say, "This is all thanks to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. The Cultural Revolution is great!" Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with the spirit of continuous battle and fearlessness of fatigue, are harvesting one plot, plowing one plot, and leveling one plot. While harvesting autumn crops, they are timely sowing winter wheat, striving for an even better harvest next year.

Revolution leading the way, production surging forward—this is the most prominent feature of this autumn's bumper harvest. Over the past year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, and launched a fierce struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, headed by Peng Zhen. They have also struggled against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They work during the day and make revolution at night. In the fields, at the edges of the fields, in the courtyards, and on the kangs (heated beds), they have set up battlefields for great criticism and great struggle everywhere, waging a "people's war." In the mass criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants recall bitterness and sweetness, exposing the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in pushing "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," "material incentives," and "production first" to restore capitalism in the countryside. This has raised class consciousness and powerfully promoted the development of production.

Class enemies have used various tricks to sabotage agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing, attempting to disrupt agricultural production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses in the suburbs of Beijing have heightened their revolutionary vigilance in the struggle, exposed the enemies' tricks, safeguarded socialist agricultural production, and bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, achieving the autumn bumper harvest.

This year, the suburbs have suffered from continuous wind, hail, and pest disasters, causing severe damage. However, the revolutionary masses tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have shown unparalleled heroism, overcoming these difficulties and achieving victory. In Pinggu County, where the hail disaster was severe, many places held meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works on the spot of disaster relief. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the cadres and community members in the disaster-stricken areas have fought tenaciously, demonstrating a fearless spirit of overcoming difficulties. At the same time, cadres and community members in non-disaster areas have also shown the spirit of "selflessness and dedication to others," launching mass activities to support the disaster-stricken areas. Now, walking through the disaster-stricken areas of this county, everywhere is a scene of bumper harvests. The community members in the disaster-stricken areas excitedly say: Achieving a bumper harvest in a disaster year is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever love Chairman Mao, forever love the Communist Party, and follow the great leader Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

　　以抓革命促生产的丰盛硕果向毛主席报喜
　　北京郊区喜获秋季大丰收
    广大贫下中农和革命干部挫败了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏，战胜了多种自然灾害，夺得玉米、谷子、水稻、油料作物等的大好丰收年景。
    新华社二十三日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，北京郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，挫败了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏，战胜了风、雹、虫灾，继夏季丰收之后，又夺得了秋季大丰收。
    目前，京郊广阔的田野里，秋收正全面展开，到处传诵着丰收的喜讯。从目前已经上场打轧的情况看，主要作物玉米、谷子、水稻、油料等，都是丰收的年景。据有关方面初步估计，今年粮食总产量将有较大幅度的增长。许多老农看到丰收的情景，高兴地说：“这都是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的功劳，文化大革命就是好！”现在，广大贫下中农和革命干部，正以连续作战、不怕疲劳的革命精神，熟一块，收一块，耕一块，平一块，在收割秋季作物的同时，及时播种冬麦，争取明年更好的收成。
    革命带头，生产跃进，这是今年秋季丰收最主要的特点。一年来，京郊广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大造以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的反，大造地富反坏右的反。他们白天搞生产，晚上闹革命。在田间、地头、场头、炕头，处处摆下了革命大批判、大斗争的战场，展开了一场“人民战争”。在群众性的大批判中，广大贫下中农忆苦思甜，控诉了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在农村推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”、“物质刺激”、“生产第一”等复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，提高了阶级觉悟，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    阶级敌人对待京郊农业生产施展种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏农业生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。京郊无产阶级革命派在斗争中加强了革命警惕性，他们揭穿了敌人的阴谋，维护了社会主义的农业生产，奋勇挑起了革命与生产两副重担，夺得了秋季丰收。
    今年，郊区的风、雹、虫灾接连发生，为害很严重。但是经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的无产阶级革命派，以无比的英雄气概，克服了这些困难，夺取了胜利。在雹灾较重的平谷县，不少地方在抗灾现场召开了活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，灾区社员、干部顽强战斗，表现了克服困难的大无畏精神。在这同时，一些非灾区的社员、干部也发扬了“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义精神，开展了群众性的支援灾区的活动。现在走遍这个县的灾区，到处是一片丰收的好庄稼。灾区的社员兴奋地说：灾年能够大丰收，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们要永远热爱毛主席，永远热爱共产党，跟着伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。
