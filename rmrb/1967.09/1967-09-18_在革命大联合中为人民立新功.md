The great revolutionary criticism movement currently unfolding nationwide is powerfully promoting revolutionary unity. Revolutionary unity is the will of the people and the trend of the times, and has become an irresistible historical tide.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, through its own battle experiences, understands best the importance and necessity of revolutionary unity. Now, our army is carrying out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," and bears a heavy responsibility for promoting revolutionary unity. Every soldier and officer in our army should be a model of uniting the broad masses, an advanced element in promoting revolutionary unity, and achieve new merits for the people in realizing revolutionary unity.

Revolutionary unity is great unity based on the great thought of Mao Zedong.

We should be models and backbones, models and backbones in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, models and backbones in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and models and backbones in executing the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Not only should we do this ourselves, but we should also help and promote workers, peasants, and students to do the same.

Units tasked with supporting the left should uphold the party spirit of the proletariat and must not intervene in local factional struggles with petty-bourgeois factionalism. Within the same region, within the army and among different units, we should unify our understanding and actions with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we should communicate situations, consult together, and promote the broadest revolutionary unity with the revolutionary leftists as the core.

In supporting the broad leftist masses, we must first support them with Mao Zedong Thought. Any words and deeds that align with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, align with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and meet the requirements of the great criticism, great unity, and "three-in-one combination," we must firmly support and strive to achieve. Any words and deeds that go against Mao Zedong Thought, cause splits, and engage in factional struggles, we must not support, and we must help them correct, helping them, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution, onto Chairman Mao's track, and the track of the Party Central Committee. This is the true care and greatest support for the broad leftist masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The more people we unite, the better." We must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, be ruthless to the enemy, and lenient to ourselves. For revolutionary mass organizations, as long as they stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and direct their struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we should inspire them to learn from each other, help each other, and promote their unity. We should guide the revolutionary masses to look forward, not backward, and not dwell on the past mistakes or errors of others who were once deceived.

Whether or not revolutionary unity can be achieved ultimately depends on whether the proletarian worldview or the bourgeois worldview prevails. Achieving revolutionary unity requires struggle. We must struggle against the enemy's overt or covert sabotage and split activities, and constantly revolutionize the "private" in our minds and the bourgeois worldview. We must, together with the proletarian revolutionaries and all revolutionary masses, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, and resolutely struggle against all erroneous tendencies that go against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only such unity is a solid revolutionary unity.

Comrades in the entire army, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive unremittingly for the development and consolidation of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"!

### 在革命大联合中为人民立新功

    在革命大联合中为人民立新功
    正在全国展开的革命大批判运动，强有力地促进着革命的大联合。革命大联合，是人心所向，大势所趋，已经成为不可阻挡的历史潮流。
    中国人民解放军从自己经过的战斗历程中，最懂得革命大联合的重要性和必要性。现在，我军担负着“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，对促进革命大联合负有重大的责任。我军的每个指战员，应当做团结广大群众的模范，当促进革命大联合的先进分子，在实现革命大联合中为人民立新功。
    革命大联合，是在伟大的毛泽东思想基础上的大联合。
    我们当模范，做骨干，是做贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的模范和骨干，是做紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的模范和骨干，是做执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部号令的模范和骨干。我们不但自己要这样做，而且要帮助和推动工人、农民、学生也这样做。
    担负支左任务的部队，要坚持无产阶级的党性，决不能用小资产阶级的派性去介入地方上的一些派别斗争。在同一个地区，部队的内部和各个不同部队之间，要用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一行动。要在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，互通情况，共同协商，促进以无产阶级革命派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合。
    支持左派广大群众，首先要用毛泽东思想去支持他们。凡是符合毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，符合毛主席的伟大战略部署，符合革命的大批判、革命的大联合、“三结合”要求的言行，我们就坚决支持，全力促其实现。凡是违背毛泽东思想，闹分裂，搞派别斗争的言行，我们就不支持，就要帮助他们纠正，帮助他们按照毛主席的指示，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，引导到毛主席的轨道，党中央的轨道。这才是对左派广大群众的真正的爱护，最大的支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“团结广大人民，团结得越多越好。”我们要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，对敌狠，对己和。对革命群众组织，只要他们站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，把斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就应该启发他们互相学习，互相帮助，促进他们联合起来。我们要引导革命群众向前看，而不要向后看，不要扭住别人过去曾经受过蒙蔽的缺点或错误不放。
    能不能实现革命的大联合，归根到底，是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观谁战胜谁的问题。实现革命大联合是要通过斗争的。既要同阶级敌人幕前或幕后的破坏和分裂活动作斗争，又要不断地革自己头脑中“私”字的命，革资产阶级世界观的命。我们要和无产阶级革命派，和一切革命群众一起，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，用无产阶级的党性去克服小资产阶级的派性，在头脑中牢固地树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，坚决同各种违反毛主席无产阶级革命路线的错误倾向作斗争。只有这样的联合，才是巩固的革命的联合。
    全军同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，而奋斗不懈！
                                              （九月十七日）
