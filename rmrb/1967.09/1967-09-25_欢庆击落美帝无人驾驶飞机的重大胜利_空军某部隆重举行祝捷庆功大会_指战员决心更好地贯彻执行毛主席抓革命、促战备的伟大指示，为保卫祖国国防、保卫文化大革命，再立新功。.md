Celebrating the Major Victory of Shooting Down an American Imperialist Unmanned Reconnaissance Aircraft

A certain unit of the Air Force held a grand victory celebration meeting.

The combatants are determined to better implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting preparedness" to defend the country's national defense and the Cultural Revolution, and to achieve new victories.

BEIJING, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force held a grand victory celebration meeting in a certain place in the south on the evening of September 22 to celebrate the major victory of shooting down an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft by our air force on September 17. The meeting commended the units and personnel who fought in the battle. The attending combatants enthusiastically cheered: This is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The combatants are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more closely, to carry out the mass revolutionary criticism more deeply, to better implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting preparedness," to defend the country's national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to achieve new victories.

The meeting was filled with red flags, drums, and singing. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed through the venue.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East is Red." The combatants held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Long live our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao! May he live ten thousand years!" They also read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "The entire command and fighting personnel of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting will. Any relaxation of the fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong."

Attending the victory celebration meeting were the responsible comrades of the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force, Luang Daquan, the responsible comrades of the Air Force leadership, Zhu Xuzhi, and more than 700 representatives from the troops, militia, and revolutionary masses.

At the meeting, Luang Daquan read the commendation order from the Central Military Commission. Representatives from various sides read congratulatory telegrams and letters and presented banners to the participating units.

Luang Daquan spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the participating troops on their victory in raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping the revolution, and promoting preparedness to defend the country's airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He strongly condemned the heinous crimes of American imperialism in collusion with Soviet revisionism in invading everywhere. Luang Daquan sternly warned the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries: Your days of being buried by the people of all countries will not be far off! The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible in the world. No matter whether you come from the air, sea, or land, no matter when you come or how many you come, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate you!

Luang Daquan encouraged the units that fought in the battle to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more closely, to carry out the revolutionary criticism more deeply, to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the revolutionary criticism, to better implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping the revolution, promoting preparedness, promoting work, and supporting the army and loving the people," to do the preparedness work better and better, and to be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade.

Amidst warm applause, Li Hongquan, a representative of the combatants who fought in the battle, spoke. He said, The victory of this battle is entirely due to our great commander Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will definitely remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to "raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We will not be arrogant or complacent, grasp the revolution, promote preparedness, and be highly vigilant, ready to fight. If the enemy dares to invade, we will make them perish and never return!

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。指战员们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！”并齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”

    龙道权勉励作战有功部队更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更深入地开展革命大批判，在革命大批判中大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，更好地贯彻执行毛主席抓革命、促战备、促工作和拥军爱民的伟大指示，把战备工作做得好上加好，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    在热烈的掌声中，作战有功人员代表李洪泉讲话。他说，这次战斗的胜利，完全归功于我们伟大的统帅毛主席，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，归功于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们一定牢记林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的指示，不骄不躁，狠抓革命，猛促战备，百倍提高警惕，严阵以待，敌人胆敢来犯，定叫他粉身碎骨，有来无回！
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
