The capital and people in various places are swiftly and earnestly studying the spirit of the speech given by central responsible comrades at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to carry out the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units in a magnificent and solid manner. They will further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, further strengthen the unity between the military and the people, concentrate on revolution, vigorously promote production, and resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of the class enemy.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 3rd, the extremely important battle orders issued by central responsible comrades at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee have greatly inspired and encouraged the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Qinghai. They unanimously expressed that they would most enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out the revolutionary criticism, concentrate firepower and targets, and criticize and expose the anti-party clique headed by China's Khrushchev from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. They will carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units and, in the process of revolutionary criticism, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat; further implement Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people" and "grasping revolution and promoting production"; prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from sowing discord and taking advantage of the chaos, and resolutely suppress their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.

In the capital, the extremely important speech by central responsible comrades was quickly conveyed to the grassroots by the members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations attending the meeting. Various units immediately organized dissemination, study, and discussion, and some units also studied specific measures for implementation. The broad masses of Red Guards in universities and secondary schools in the capital expressed their firm support for the important battle orders issued by central responsible comrades and their determination to follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao. They said that to carry out the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, they would resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, requiring all students who are linking up outside to immediately return to Beijing and to their units to make revolution. The Red Guards expressed their firm support for the central government's dissolution of the "May 16 Corps," a counter-revolutionary organization manipulated by a small group of bad leaders, and to be highly vigilant against the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, Soviet revisionist spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and to suppress them resolutely once discovered.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army were greatly inspired upon hearing the new battle orders from the Party Central Committee. They said they would definitely fulfill their responsibilities to support the revolutionary cadres, support the revolutionary masses, and stand together, fight together, and win together with them. If imperialism, modern revisionism, the Kuomintang bandits, and the small clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road dare to cause trouble and sabotage, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate them!

Today, although it is a Sunday, many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in factories in the capital voluntarily went to the factories to discuss and study the speech by central responsible comrades, formulate new battle plans, and take practical actions to respond to the battle orders issued by the Party Central Committee. Many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the Beijing Stamp Factory, according to the battle orders of the Party Central Committee, specially held a meeting to re-study the battle deployment of the revolutionary criticism.

The Beijing Municipal Farmers' Congress held an expanded meeting of its standing committee to discuss how to follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. They passed an urgent letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary community members in the suburbs, calling on everyone to resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Peng Zhen from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the revisionist line they promoted in the countryside; better carry out support-the-army activities, grasp revolution and promote production, and strive for a great harvest in agriculture this year.

The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an emergency expanded meeting on the evening of the 3rd and issued an important notice, calling on all levels of revolutionary committees, revolutionary mass organizations, all revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary people in Shanghai to recognize the current good situation, with the most firm, enthusiastic, active, and swift battle posture, immediately follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and unconditionally implement the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. The notice said that all students and other revolutionary masses in Shanghai who are linking up outside should resolutely listen to the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and immediately return to Shanghai and their original units to make revolution on the spot. The notice said that we must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call for carrying out the "support-the-army and love-the-people" movement, unconditionally implement the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee on "carrying out the support-the-army and love-the-people movement on a larger scale," and cherish the unity between the military and the people as we cherish our own eyes, and be highly vigilant against the class enemy's attempts to take advantage of the situation. The notice called on all revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the city to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for "grasping revolution and promoting production" and further saving for revolution, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of socialism, and strive to complete and overfulfill the glorious tasks given by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the working class and revolutionary people of Shanghai.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai learned from the radio and newspapers on the 3rd that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, according to the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, issued important battle orders. They immediately conducted study and discussion sessions.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and in the process of revolutionary criticism, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." To implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "supporting the army and loving the people" and "grasping revolution and promoting production," we have already dispatched a group of revolutionary students and revolutionary cadres to work with the soldiers and officers of the PLA on the front lines of production, conducting extensive propaganda work, and striving to complete and overfulfill the national production plan.

We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people," carry out support-the-army activities, strengthen military-civilian unity, and firmly support the People's Liberation Army.

We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.
