Autumn harvest and sowing are about to begin. How to formulate the autumn sowing plan is a major issue related to the entire national plan for next year, and it is also a major issue related to the production of the production team. When we were in the Second Production Team of Shexing Brigade, Daxing Commune, Sheyang County, we saw that their practice of implementing the autumn sowing plan during the great criticism of the revolution was very good.

The soil of this production team is suitable for growing grain and cotton. How to reasonably arrange the planting area for grain and cotton? Some people advocated planting according to the national plan; some people advocated planting less grain and more cotton. They said: "Planting more cotton can earn more money." Some even said: "One picul of cotton can be exchanged for several piculs of grain. Expanding the grain planting area, the income is less, it's not worth it." Regarding this ideological situation, poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat believed that this was a few people who had been poisoned by the idea of money worship promoted by China's Khrushchev, putting "self" first, and not seeing the overall interests. Therefore, they organized cadres and community members to study the "Three Articles" and relevant quotations from Chairman Mao, using the evening rest time to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. A poor peasant member said: Capitalist management ideas are corrosive. With it, one can only see the tip of one's nose and think only of oneself. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." This is a great strategic line. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings. Revolutionary martyr's family member and old poor peasant Liang Guoxiang said: Whether or not to plant according to the national plan is an important aspect of the struggle between the two lines in the countryside. When we formulate the autumn sowing plan, we must insist on political leadership, firmly serve the national interests, and oppose the pursuit of personal and small collective interests in the short term.

Through study and criticism, everyone unanimously agreed to plant according to the national plan, appropriately increasing the sowing area of winter wheat while completing the cotton production task.

Currently, the cadres and community members of this team are using the great criticism as motivation, managing the autumn crops in the fields to welcome the autumn harvest, and vigorously promoting fertilizer production to prepare sufficient base fertilizer for autumn sowing.

### 以革命大批判为动力按国家计划落实秋播

    以革命大批判为动力按国家计划落实秋播
    秋收秋种即将开始，如何制定秋播规划，是关系明年整个国家计划的大事，也是关系到生产队生产的大事。我们在射阳县大兴公社射兴大队第二生产队时，看到他们在革命大批判中落实秋播规划的做法很好。
    这个生产队的土质宜种粮食也宜种棉花。怎样合理安排粮棉种植面积呢？有人主张按照国家计划进行种植；有人主张少种粮食，多种棉花。他们说：“多长棉花能多分钞票”。有的还说：“一担皮棉能换好几担粮食，扩大粮食面积，收入少，不上算。”对这种思想情况，贫下中农和无产阶级革命派认为，这是少数人中了中国赫鲁晓夫钞票挂帅的毒，“私”字当头，没有看到整体利益。于是，他们就组织干部和社员带着这个问题学习了“老三篇”和有关毛主席语录，利用晚上歇工时间，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。一个贫农社员说：资本主义经营思想是腐蚀剂，有了它就只能看到自己的鼻子尖，一个劲儿想自己。毛主席教导我们：“备战、备荒、为人民”，这是一个伟大战略方针，我们一定要按毛主席的教导去做。烈属老贫农梁国祥说：按不按国家计划种植，是农村两条路线斗争的一个重要方面。我们制定秋播规划时，一定要坚持政治挂帅，坚决服从国家利益，反对单纯追求个人和小集体的暂时利益。
    通过学习、批判，大家一致同意按照国家计划，在完成棉花生产任务的情况下，适当增加三麦播种面积。
    目前，这个队的干部和社员，正以大批判为动力，一面抓好秋熟作物田间管理，迎接秋收到来，一面大搞堆肥，为秋播备足基肥。　		江苏射阳县大兴公社中心通讯组
