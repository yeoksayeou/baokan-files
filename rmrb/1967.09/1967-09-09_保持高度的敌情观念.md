The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article is like a sharp sword that strikes at the vital points of the revisionist, the personal ambitions of the Ertao Zhishu. It completely exposes his counter-revolutionary two-faced nature in broad daylight. The fall of another historical clown proves a great truth: all demons and ghosts cannot escape the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought that reveals their true nature.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article raises a very important issue: we must not allow Ertao Zhishu-like figures to disrupt our ranks from the right or the "left," and disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The deepening of the class struggle situation and the continuous victories of the proletarian revolutionary masses force the class enemy to constantly change their tactics. They use various means to shift the direction of the struggle, which is the main tactic used by the class enemy to sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

The class enemy is taking advantage of the shortcomings and mistakes within the revolutionary ranks. If we do not remain highly vigilant about this, if we do not maintain a clear awareness of the enemy, and if we do not use the perspective of class struggle to analyze everything and everyone, we will deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary course and make grave mistakes.

In our ranks, the vast majority of comrades have a high level of revolutionary vigilance. However, there are some comrades whose minds are in a state of chaos all day, who cannot use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions, who follow others blindly, say wrong things, and do wrong things. For example, they say things like, "Currently, Hohhot is too quiet, we need another big chaos," or "The authority of the proletarian revolution can only be established through shelling," or they shout, "Old revolutionaries are being marginalized, the middle forces are usurping power, the fruit-pickers should get out." And so on. These comrades have fallen into the trap of the class enemy, but they are oblivious to it. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article rings another alarm bell for these comrades.

Chairman Mao said: "There are many things that, if we fall into passivity and lack self-awareness, can become our burdens and obstacles." For some comrades, the heavier the burden, the greater the passivity. "I am a genuine leftist," "I have many merits." Such burdens weigh heavily on some people, making them unable to breathe. Therefore, at the slightest dissatisfaction, they want to vent their "revolutionary" anger, pull out their troops, and raise their own banners, turning serious political struggles into factional struggles without principles, turning class struggles for power into power struggles within small groups. They unconsciously help the class enemy greatly, giving the class enemy an opportunity.

What do we have to be complacent about? Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, without the support of the People's Liberation Army led by Comrade Lin Biao, it would be impossible to carry out this great Cultural Revolution, and it would be impossible to achieve the current unprecedented good revolutionary situation. We have achieved some results, but there is nothing to be proud of. If we are not just a verbal revolutionary, but a genuine revolutionary, we will definitely put the party spirit of the proletariat in the first place, put Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, and put the interests of the people in the first place. In this way, we will put down our burdens, start our engines, and truly use Mao Zedong Thought to correctly analyze and handle various issues in the struggle. This is what the class enemy fears the most. In this way, they will have no place to hide, and their conspiracies will be exposed without a trace.

We believe that after a year of storms and waves, the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary ranks will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, smash all the conspiracies of the class enemy, prevent influences from the "left" and the right, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and strike hard at a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

　　保持高度的敌情观念
　　呼和浩特市八·一八革命造反兵团
    姚文元同志的重要文章的发表，就象一把利剑，击中了赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家陶铸的要害，把他的反革命两面派的嘴脸，完全暴露在光天化日之下。又一个历史小丑的下台，证明了一个伟大的真理：一切妖魔鬼怪都逃脱不了毛泽东思想的照妖镜。
    姚文元同志的文章提出了一个十分重要的问题，就是：决不能让陶铸式的人物从右的方面或“左”的方面来搅乱我们的阵线，打乱毛主席的伟大战略部署。阶级斗争形势的深入发展，无产阶级革命派的不断胜利，迫使阶级敌人不断改变斗争策略。用各种手段来转移斗争的大方向，这正是当前阶级敌人破坏文化大革命所采用的主要策略。
    阶级敌人正在利用革命派内部的缺点和错误。如果我们不高度警惕这一点，不保持清醒的敌情观念，不用阶级斗争的观点去分析一切事物、一切人，就会离开毛主席的革命航道，就会犯极大的错误。
    在我们的队伍中，绝大多数同志具有高度的革命警惕性，但也有一些同志终日头脑中乱哄哄的，不能很好地用毛泽东思想来指导自己的一切行动，跟着别人乱跑，说了一些错话，作了一些错事。例如，说什么“目前呼和浩特市平静得可怕，要再来一次大乱”，什么“无产阶级革命权威，只能在炮轰中建立”，还喊什么“老造反派受排挤，中间势力篡权，摘桃派滚蛋”。如此等等。这些同志上了阶级敌人的当，但他们却昏昏然毫不在意。姚文元同志的文章，又一次给这些同志敲起了警钟。
    毛主席说：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”对于某些同志来说，往往包袱越重，盲目性也就越大。“我是响当当的左派”，“我的功劳不少”。这样的包袱压得某些人喘不过气来。因而，稍不如意就要发造反派的“脾气”，拉出队伍，独树旗帜，把严肃的政治斗争变成无原则的宗派斗争，把阶级的夺权变成小团体的争权。他们不自觉地给阶级敌人帮了大忙，给阶级敌人以可乘之机。
    我们到底有什么值得自满的呢？没有毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，没有毛主席缔造的、林彪同志亲自指挥的解放军作后盾，就根本不可能进行这场伟大的文化大革命，就不可能出现今天这样空前大好的革命形势。我们有了一些成绩，根本不值得骄傲。如果我们不是一个口头革命派，而是一个真正的革命派，我们就一定会把无产阶级的党性放在第一位，把毛泽东思想放在第一位，把人民的利益放在第一位。这样，我们就会放下包袱，开动机器，真正用毛泽东思想来正确地分析和处理斗争中的各种问题。这正是阶级敌人最害怕的。这样一来，他们就无藏身之地，他们的阴谋就会暴露无遗。
    我们相信，经过一年来的大风大浪的锻炼，无产阶级革命派同志必将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，防止来自“左”的和右的影响，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，狠狠打击一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
