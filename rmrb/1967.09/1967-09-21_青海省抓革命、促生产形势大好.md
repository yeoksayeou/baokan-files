The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Qinghai Province who participated in the "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary movement have resolutely responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, achieving one victory after another in the campaign to "grasp revolution and promote production."

In the second quarter of this year, the total industrial output value of the entire province increased by 40 percent compared to the first quarter. The production in June set a new record in the history of Qinghai's industrial production. Many factories have made up for the production shortfall in the first quarter of this year, which was caused by the sabotage of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Railway and highway transportation, except for being affected by heavy rain in August, have exceeded the planned targets every month since the second quarter. In particular, the railway transportation tasks have been completed very well. The total grain production in the agricultural areas is expected to exceed the highest annual production level in history, making it a bumper harvest year. In the pastoral areas, the young livestock are thriving, and it is estimated that the net increase rate of livestock this year can reach more than 9 percent. The production plans for livestock products such as hides and wool have also been completed well. The famous "Xining wool" has set a new record for annual production this year.

　  青海省抓革命、促生产形势大好
    青海省“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和革命群众最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，在“抓革命，促生产”中取得了一个又一个新胜利。
    今年第二季度，全省工业总产值比第一季度猛增百分之四十，六月份的生产创造了青海工业生产史上的最新纪录，许多工厂补上了今年第一季度由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的破坏而造成的生产缺额。铁路和公路运输除在八月份受到暴雨影响外，第二季度以来每个月都超额完成了计划，特别是铁路运输任务完成得更好。农业区的粮食总产量将突破历史上的最高年产水平，是一个特大的丰收年。在牧业区，仔畜丰产丰收，预计今年牲畜净增率可以达到百分之九以上。皮张、羊毛等畜产品的生产计划也完成得很好，驰名世界的“西宁毛”，今年创造了年产量的历史最高纪录。
