Editor's Note: Grain production is a matter of great importance to the lives of the broad masses of people, socialist construction, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. We must seriously follow the teachings of Chairman Mao and grasp the grain issue tightly.

This year, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about a bumper harvest in agriculture. We must cherish the fruits of this harvest and pay close attention to every link from sowing to harvesting, from management to use, without the slightest relaxation. As suggested in these two letters, we must first use revolutionary criticism as a driving force to mobilize the broad masses of commune members to harvest in a timely manner and bring in all the high-yielding grains; at the same time, we must make early arrangements for autumn plowing and sowing plans to prepare for an even better harvest next year. We must make every village cadre and commune member understand that increasing grain production is a contribution to the Cultural Revolution and a contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Every Grain Collected Contributes to the Cultural Revolution

This year, our crops have grown exceptionally well. Walking into the cornfield, the corn cobs reach the shoulders; walking into the sorghum field, the sorghum heads hit the face. Poor and lower-middle peasants all say: "Following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, gold flows on the ground; the Cultural Revolution has brought a bumper harvest."

"For three days after the Autumn Equinox, there is no green field." Autumn crops are gradually ripening, and early autumn crops have already been harvested. Is the task completed? No, we must continue to beat the drums and urge the horses forward; we must not rest halfway and miss the opportunity just as the harvest is within reach. We must arrange the harvesting sequence based on the solar terms, plots, temperature, and rainfall. Recently, our brigade, in conjunction with revolutionary criticism, has implemented the harvesting plan. We have resolved the erroneous notions of "having things but not worrying about harvesting" and "seeing yellow and starting to cut, harvesting early and threshing early, rushing the process." We have corrected the tendency to focus only on harvesting early autumn crops while neglecting the field management of late autumn crops. Everyone has come to realize that timely harvesting, increasing the grain by one-tenth per ear, and collecting one more grain per plant can result in thousands upon thousands of pounds of additional grain for a production team. This is a big account! Moreover, whether it is revolution or production, every step must be taken, and every step must be solid. When harvesting early autumn crops, we must strengthen the field management of late autumn crops and add one more measure to increase production, which will result in an increase of one-tenth of the yield. This is another big account!

In summary, increasing the grain by one-tenth, adding one more measure to increase production, and collecting one more grain is a contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a contribution to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a blow to the Chinese Khrushchev.

"Three springs are not as busy as one autumn." Now is the time to test whether cadres truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and an opportunity for cadres to do new deeds for the people. Cadres must be bold and go to the masses to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly support this.

### 多收一粒粮就对文化大革命多一分贡献

专栏：革命群众来信

    编者按：粮食生产，是关系广大人民生活、社会主义建设和支援世界人民革命斗争的大事。我们必须认真地遵照毛主席的教导，把粮食问题抓得很紧很紧。
    今年，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命带来了农业的大丰收。我们必须珍视丰收果实，十分注意抓紧抓好从种到收、从管到用的每一个环节，丝毫也不能放松。要象这两封来信中提出的那样：首先以革命的大批判作为动力，发动广大社员适时收割，把丰产的粮食全部收到手；同时要尽早安排好秋耕秋播计划，为争取明年更好的收成作准备。要使每一个农村干部和社员都懂得，多收粮食，就是对文化大革命多作出贡献，就是对世界人民的革命斗争多作出贡献。
    多收一粒粮就对文化大革命多一分贡献
    今年我们这里的庄稼长得就是好。进了苞米地，苞米棒子顶肩膀；进了谷子地，谷穗打脸皮。贫下中农都说：“照毛主席指的道走，满地黄金流；文化大革命带来了大丰收。”
      “处暑三天无青田”。秋季作物逐渐成熟了，早秋作物已经开镰收割了，是不是大功告成了呢？不，还得猛擂催阵鼓，紧挥策马鞭；决不可眼看丰收果实快到手，就“半道歇晌”，误了大事。我们要根据节气、地块、气温、雨水，安排先收什么后收什么。最近我们队结合革命的大批判落实了收割计划。我们解决了“有了东西不愁收”和“见黄就动刀，早收早上场，早了心思”的错误认识，纠正了只顾早秋作物收割，不顾晚秋作物田间管理的错误倾向。大家认识到，适时收割，多拔一成籽粒，每棵庄稼多收一粒粮食，一个生产队就可多收成千上万斤粮食，这是一笔大账！再说，不管闹革命，还是搞生产，都得走这步，看下步，步步不落空。收割早秋作物的时候，加强晚秋作物的田间管理，多添一分增产措施，就会多增一成年景，这又是一笔大账！
    总之，多拔一成籽粒，多增一分增产措施，多收一粒粮食，就是对无产阶级文化大革命多一分贡献，就是为保卫毛主席的革命路线增添一分力量，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫多打出一颗炮弹。
    “三春不抵秋忙”。现在正是考验干部是不是真正站在毛主席革命路线一边的时候，也是干部为人民立新功的好机会。干部要敢字当头，到群众中去参加秋收，领导秋收，我们贫下中农坚决支持。
