Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a great revolution that touches people's souls. It is also a great opportunity to test and temper cadres. Every one of us leaders should voluntarily accept the test and actively throw ourselves into the revolutionary struggle.

Chairman Mao calls on us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." Over the past year, under Chairman Mao's great call, in the "great storm of mass struggle," I have been tested and tempered, and received profound education.

In the early stages of the movement, because I did not understand this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I once executed the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing revolutionary masses. Later, after repeated study, especially after the publication of the "Sixteen Points," by comparing my actions, I realized that my position was wrong. However, at that time, I did not dare to clearly express my attitude towards the black directives of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former provincial party committee, nor did I dare to openly resist. Towards the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction, although I knew their general direction was correct, I did not dare to support them.

Why was my attitude ambiguous, full of misgivings, and wavering? Ultimately, it was the "private" self at work. At that time, I thought: if I stand up to make a revolution, and if the capitalist-roaders in power cannot be overthrown, what if they cause trouble for me in the future? What if I lose my "official hat" and am labeled a "counter-revolutionary"? Moreover, in my past work, I had many shortcomings and errors, and since the Cultural Revolution, I had executed the bourgeois reactionary line. If I stand up, won't people say I am a "political opportunist"? Won't people seize on my mistakes and not let go?

Just as I was hesitating, the comrades of the "August 18" revolutionary faction helped me with both seriousness and warmth, encouraging me to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's teachings and intense ideological struggle, I realized: as a Communist Party member, in the life-and-death class struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of its restoration by the proletariat, one must unyieldingly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, become a vanguard fighter of the proletarian revolution, otherwise one is not worthy of being a Communist Party member. Thus, in December of last year, I made up my mind to break away from the old camp. On one hand, I publicly expressed my support for the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction; on the other hand, I launched a counterattack, exposing the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and suppression of revolution crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the province and the ministry.

My actions offended the capitalist-roaders in power within the party. They "shoot the bird that sticks its head out" and manipulated the conservative organizations to encircle and fight me. At this time, my thoughts wavered again, facing another choice between two paths. Thus, I reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must be ready at any time to stand by the truth, because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communist Party members must be ready at any time to correct errors, because any error is not in the interests of the people." I made up my mind to cast aside personal gains and losses and no longer hesitate. The comrades of the "August 18" faction also encouraged me to swim against the current and advance against the resistance. Thus, I once again publicly expressed my support for the "August 18" revolutionary faction and further exposed the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in power within the party. In February of this year, at a critical moment of intense struggle, I and several other leaders jointly issued a statement, further expressing our firm support for the "August 18" revolutionary faction, and calling on the masses within the conservative organizations who were deceived to bravely break away.

To side with the proletarian revolutionary faction, one must do so thoroughly, without dragging one's feet or being vague. At that time, some "well-meaning" people advised me to "be more pragmatic"; at the same time, the conservative organizations, under the manipulation of the capitalist-roaders in power within the party, continued to wage a ruthless struggle against me, attempting to force me to betray the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At this critical moment of class struggle, could I be afraid of death and surrender? Could I betray Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? No! Absolutely not! Therefore, I told the conservative organizations that were encircling and fighting me: even if my head is cut off, I will still support the "August 18"! I also, together with the comrades of the "August 18" revolutionary faction, denounced the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and together guarded the revolutionary *Qinghai Daily*.

The severe class struggle made me deeply realize: a revolutionary leader, in order to resolutely execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, must fight alongside the revolutionary faction against the class enemy, and voluntarily expose one's thoughts to the broad revolutionary masses, accept the masses' inspection, and seek their help.

In the movement, I had taken some revolutionary actions and stood firm on some issues. However, for a revolutionary leader, this is far from enough. In the Cultural Revolution, one must dare to criticize others and also dare to criticize oneself. The absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought must be established in the minds of every cadre.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." To stand up and make a revolution, one must go among the masses, and under the supervision and criticism of the revolutionary masses, be reformed and improved. One should not fear the masses' criticism. Even if there are opinions with factual discrepancies, one should listen patiently, with the spirit of "if there is a problem, correct it; if there is none, strive harder," calmly think, and deeply touch one's soul.

In the process of standing up to make a revolution, I paid special attention to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The fundamental reason for past mistakes was not studying Chairman Mao's works enough. Now, to recognize and correct mistakes, one must use Chairman Mao's teachings as the standard, examine oneself, and seriously go through a process of study, self-examination, further study, and further self-examination. One must resolutely ensure that mistakes are not omitted, the essence of the problem is not avoided, the root of the mistake is deeply excavated, self-criticism is strict, and in seizing the power of the "private" self, dare to "see the blade."

To carry out self-revolution, one must actively join the great tide of criticism, fiercely expose the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and in the criticism, eliminate the poison in one's mind.

Having exposed oneself among the revolutionary masses, can one think that one has passed the test and relax? Absolutely not. After standing up to make a revolution, I did two things: first, I made a summary of my ideological revolution, conducted a thorough and systematic cleansing of my thoughts, relentlessly pursued and attacked my fatal weaknesses and errors, and must always be vigilant to prevent recurrence. Second, I established an unbreakable system of studying Chairman Mao's works, especially following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "Study the 'Three Articles' as a motto." Continuously and thoroughly reform one's worldview, maintain revolutionary integrity, follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution.

Leaders standing up to make a revolution in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new starting point on the revolutionary journey. If one treats "exposing oneself" as a mere formality, "going on stage to disguise oneself and off stage to reveal one's true self," this is not the behavior of a genuine and thorough revolutionary, but merely a fleeting ugly character on the political stage. Proletarian revolutionaries must not be like this. The revolutionary road is long, and in the future, I will definitely continue to revolutionize, forever revolutionize, bravely shoulder the responsibilities of revolution and production, and with practical actions, strive to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　破私立公，勇敢地站出来革命
　　青海省革命委员会常委、原公路局局长　张秉楠
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。也是考验干部、锻炼干部的大好时机。我们每一个领导干部都应该自觉地接受考验，积极投身到革命斗争的洪流中去。
    毛主席号召我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”一年多来，我在毛主席的伟大号召下，在“群众斗争的大风雨”中，经受了考验和锻炼，受到极深刻的教育。
    运动初期，由于我对这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命很不理解，因此，曾一度执行了资产阶级反动路线，打击了革命群众。后来经过反复学习，特别是《十六条》公布以后，对照自己的行动，才认识到我的立场站错了。但是，当时我对原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派压制革命的黑指示，还不敢明确地表示自己的态度，不敢公开抵制。对“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，虽然知道他们大方向是正确的，也不敢支持。
    我为什么态度暧昧，顾虑重重，摇摇摆摆呢？归根到底是“私”字在作怪。当时我想：站出来闹革命，如果走资本主义道路当权派打不倒，将来他们给我找麻烦怎么办？丢掉“乌纱帽”、被打成“反党分子”怎么办？同时，我在过去的工作中也有不少缺点和错误，文化大革命以来又执行了资产阶级反动路线，如果站出来，人家不会说我是“政治投机”吗？不会被人家揪住小辫子不放吗？
    就在我犹豫不定的时候，“八·一八”革命派的同志，对我进行了既严肃又热情的帮助，让我反复学习毛主席的教导，鼓励我坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边。通过反复学习毛主席著作，经过激烈的思想斗争，我认识到：做为一个共产党员，在资本主义复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的阶级斗争中，一定要坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，做一名冲锋陷阵的无产阶级革命战士，不然就不配当一个共产党员。于是我在去年十二月便下定决心从旧的营垒中杀出来。一方面，我公开表示支持“八·一八”无产阶级革命派；另一方面，我狠杀回马枪，揭发省、厅党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想和压制革命的种种罪行。
    我的行动触犯了党内走资本主义道路当权派。他们“枪打出头鸟”，操纵保守组织的群众对我实行围斗。这时，我的思想又有反复，再一次面临着两条道路的抉择。于是，我重温毛主席的教导：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。”我下决心抛掉个人得失，不再犹豫徘徊。“八·一八”的战友们，也鼓励我顶着逆流走，迎着阻力行。于是，我再一次公开表示支持“八·一八”革命派，并且进一步揭发了党内走资本主义道路当权派的种种罪行。今年二月，在斗争极其激烈的关键时刻，我同其他几个领导干部联合发表了一个声明，进一步表示坚定地支持“八·一八”革命派，呼吁保守组织内受蒙蔽的群众勇敢地杀出来。
    倒向无产阶级革命派，必须倒得彻底，不能拖泥带水，含含糊糊。当时曾有些“好心”人，劝我“识时务一些”；与此同时，保守组织在党内走资本主义道路当权派的操纵下，对我继续进行残酷斗争，妄图迫使我背离“八·一八”无产阶级革命派，背叛毛主席的革命路线。在阶级斗争的关键时刻，我能贪生怕死屈膝投降吗？我能背叛毛主席的革命路线吗？不能！绝对不能！因此，我向围斗我的保守组织说：即使我的脑袋掉了，也要支持“八·一八”！我并且同“八·一八”革命派的战友们一起声讨党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一起守卫革命的《青海日报》。
    严酷的阶级斗争，使我深深体会到：一个革命的领导干部，要想坚决地执行毛主席的革命路线，就必须和革命派一起跟阶级敌人战斗，同时自觉地把自己的思想亮给广大革命群众，接受革命群众的检查，取得他们的帮助。
    在运动中，我曾有过某些革命行动，在一些问题上立场站对了。但是，对于一个革命的领导干部来说，远不应该以此为满足。在文化大革命中，既要勇于革别人的命，也要敢于革自己的命。每个干部的头脑中都要树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    毛主席教导说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”要想站出来革命，就要走到群众当中去，使自己在革命群众的监督和批评下得到改造和提高。对革命群众的批评，不要怕尖锐。即便事实有出入的意见，也要耐心地听，本着“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神，冷静思考，狠触灵魂。
    在站出来革命的过程中，我十分注意活学活用毛主席著作。过去犯错误的根本原因，就是对毛主席著作学习得不够。现在要认识和改正错误，必须以毛主席的教导做准绳，对照检查自己，认真地经历一个学习、检查，再学习、再检查的过程。要坚决做到错误事实不遗漏，问题实质不回避，错误根源要挖深，自我批判要从严，在夺“私”字的权中敢于“刺刀见红”。
    要进行自我革命，必须积极投入革命的大批判的洪流中去，狠揭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，在批判中消自己头脑中的毒。
    在革命群众中亮了相，是否可以认为已经过了关，从而松一口气呢？决不能这样想。我在站出来革命后，做了这样两件事：第一，作出自己的思想革命的小结，在思想上来一次全面系统的彻底的大扫除，对自己的致命的弱点和错误，穷追猛打，而且要时刻警惕，防止重犯。第二，建立雷打不散的学习毛主席著作的制度，特别要按照林副主席的指示：“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学”。不断地彻底地改造自己的世界观，保持革命的晚节，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    领导干部在无产阶级文化大革命中站出来革命，这是在革命征途上的一个新的起点。如果把“亮相”当作一个形式，“上台化装掩人耳目，下台卸装依然如故”，那绝不是一个真正的彻底的革命者的行为，只不过是政治舞台上一个来去匆匆的丑角。无产阶级革命派绝不应该这样。革命的道路是漫长的，今后我一定要不断革命，永远革命，勇于担起革命和生产的重担，以实际行动争取在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
