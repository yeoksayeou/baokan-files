Shanghai's revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity from the ideological standpoint, and concentrating their firepower to deepen the revolutionary criticism.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 24th, our correspondent comments: On the eve of National Day, revolutionary unity in Shanghai has greatly promoted revolutionary criticism. A mass movement of studying and deepening revolutionary criticism has become more extensive and profound. The proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating their firepower and targets, and from all sides encircling the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as their head. The study and revolutionary criticism have further consolidated and developed revolutionary unity from the ideological standpoint. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is an important sign of the current excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai.

Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. The latest instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao is like a strong east wind, stirring up a surging tide of revolutionary unity on both banks of the Huangpu River. This unprecedented situation of great unity and solidarity among the proletarian revolutionary cadres is a powerful refutation of the conspiracy by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as their head to create splits among the revolutionary masses!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The new social system has just been established and needs a period of consolidation. It is impossible to think that the new system is completely consolidated once it is established. It needs to be gradually consolidated." The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shanghai deeply understand that after achieving organizational revolutionary unity, it is even more important to continually consolidate and develop unity from the ideological standpoint. Only unity based on the great principles of Mao Zedong Thought is true unity and consolidated unity. Only ideological unity can withstand any difficulties and storms; only ideological unity can unleash the greatest fighting power, fiercely attacking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; only ideological unity can enable the proletarian revolutionary cadres to unite with all those who can be united, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, smoothly achieve revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and seize and use power well.

To consolidate revolutionary unity from the ideological standpoint, the fundamental principle is to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. We must vigorously study Mao Zedong Thought and regard it as the highest criterion for all actions. In the sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shanghai have always placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything. For every battle order from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, they carry it out resolutely and execute it resolutely. The current leap in revolutionary unity in Shanghai is precisely the result of the proletarian revolutionary cadres seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the policies and directives of the Party Central Committee. In the process of achieving revolutionary unity and after achieving revolutionary unity, the proletarian revolutionary cadres have encountered many new situations and new problems. They bring these problems to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, finding the principles, policies, and methods to solve problems from Chairman Mao's works. In the factory-concentrated Yangpu District of Shanghai, two worker revolutionary mass organizations have united, but although they have united organizationally, they have not truly united ideologically, and opposing sentiments still exist, with some even saying that this unity is "compromising." The joint command department, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related editorials in "Red Flag" and "People's Daily," receiving extremely profound education. They realized that with the great enemy in front, there is no reason for them to create friction, and disagreements must be resolved according to the principle of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity." Since they have already united and formed a new unified revolutionary mass organization, why should they still be attached to their own faction? Obviously, this is the small-bourgeois factionalism playing tricks in some people's minds. Through study, the headquarters personnel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, broke private interests and established public interests, with a more vigorous fighting posture, actively went deep into the grassroots, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and did detailed ideological and political work, helping the grassroots revolutionary mass organizations to consolidate and develop revolutionary unity. After many revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai achieved revolutionary unity, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, broke private interests and established public interests, established the idea of seizing power for the proletariat, solved the problem of the leading core, and the problem of the name of the revolutionary mass organization after unity, relatively smoothly formed a new leading cadre. Practice has proven that this is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating and developing revolutionary unity organizationally and ideologically.

To consolidate revolutionary unity from the ideological standpoint, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and more deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as their head, and thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the bourgeois reactionary line. Struggle requires unity, and unity can better fight the struggle. After achieving revolutionary unity, the new battle tasks immediately arise. The new high tide of revolutionary unity in Shanghai is just beginning, but the powerful promotion of revolutionary criticism by revolutionary unity is already evident everywhere. This is notably reflected in the revolutionary criticism columns on Shanghai's streets. Due to concentrated targets, unified steps, and strong forces, the revolutionary criticism columns' big-character posters are of increasingly high quality. The previous big-character posters fighting "internal wars" have been replaced by revolutionary criticism big-character posters. The heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as their head are further exposed in broad daylight. Especially inspiring is the fact that in Shanghai's factories, enterprises, shops, schools, and neighborhoods, there are vigorous and solid class criticism, shop criticism, class criticism, and alley criticism, with denunciations of China's Khrushchev and his agents everywhere.

The leap in revolutionary unity in Shanghai is the result of the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses overcoming small-bourgeois factionalism with proletarian party spirit. An important experience drawn by the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Shanghai from their struggle practice is that in the process of achieving revolutionary unity, it is necessary to wage an irreconcilable struggle against small-bourgeois factionalism; after achieving revolutionary unity, it is still necessary to place the task of eliminating small-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit in an important position. For the small-bourgeois ideology within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and guiding it onto the track of proletarian revolution can we consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署
　　从思想上巩固发展革命大联合
　　集中火力深入开展革命大批判
    据新华社上海二十四日电　本社记者述评：国庆前夕的上海，革命大联合极大地推动了革命的大批判，一个群众性的大学习和革命大批判运动更加广泛、更加深入地向前发展。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，集中火力，集中目标，从各个方面围剿以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。大学习和革命的大批判，又从思想上进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是当前上海无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的一个重要标志。
    在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。伟大领袖毛主席的这个最新指示，犹如强劲的东风，在黄浦江两岸卷起了革命大联合的滚滚洪流。这个前所未有的无产阶级革命派大联合、大团结的新局面雄辩地说明，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，在革命群众中制造分裂的阴谋彻底破产了！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“新的社会制度还刚刚建立，还需要有一个巩固的时间。不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。需要逐步地巩固。”上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众深深地懂得，实现了组织上的革命大联合之后，更重要的是不断在思想上巩固大联合，发展大联合。只有在伟大的毛泽东思想原则基础上的联合，才是真正的联合，巩固的联合。只有思想上的大联合，组织上的大联合才能经得起任何艰难险阻，惊涛骇浪；只有思想上的大联合，才能发挥最大的战斗力，狠狠向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火；只有思想上的大联合，无产阶级革命派才能团结一切可以团结的人们，搞好本单位的斗批改，顺利实现革命的“三结合”，掌好权，用好权。
    从思想上巩固革命大联合，根本的根本，是在无产阶级革命派和革命群众的头脑里大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。要大力学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想作为一切行动的最高准则。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐复杂斗争中，上海无产阶级革命派、革命群众始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，坚决照办，坚决执行。当前上海出现的革命大联合的飞跃，正是无产阶级革命派认真学习毛主席最新指示、党中央方针政策的结果。在革命大联合过程中和实现革命大联合以后，无产阶级革命派遇到许多新的情况和新的问题。他们带着这些问题，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中找到解决问题的方针、政策、办法来。上海工厂集中的杨浦区，两个工人革命群众组织联合起来了，虽然组织上联合了，但思想上并未真正联合，对立情绪仍然存在，甚至有人说这种联合是“和稀泥”。联合指挥部在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作以及《红旗》、《人民日报》有关社论，再次受到极其深刻的教育。他们认识到，大敌当前，彼此之间没有任何理由再闹磨擦，有意见必须本着“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的原则解决。既然已经联合起来，组成一个新的统一的革命群众组织了，为什么还要迷恋自己的那一派呢？很明显，这是小资产阶级派性在某些人的头脑中作怪。通过学习，总部人员以毛泽东思想为武器，破私立公，以更昂扬的战斗姿态，纷纷深入基层，宣传毛泽东思想，作深入细致的思想政治工作，帮助基层革命群众组织巩固和发展革命的大联合。上海许多革命群众组织实现革命大联合以后，都是这样用毛泽东思想为武器，破私立公，树立起为无产阶级掌权的思想，解决了领导核心问题，大联合后革命群众组织的名称问题，比较顺利地组成了新的领导班子。实践证明，这是从组织上、思想上巩固、发展革命大联合的根本保证。
    从思想上巩固革命大联合，必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒。斗争需要联合，联合起来就能更好地斗争。革命大联合以后，马上就面临着新的战斗任务。上海革命大联合的新高潮方兴未艾，而革命大联合强有力地推动革命大批判的效果已经到处可见。这显著地表现在上海街头革命大批判专栏上。由于目标集中，步伐整齐，力量强大，革命大批判专栏的大字报，水平越来越高。原来的一些打“内战”的大字报，已被革命大批判的大字报所代替。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行进一步暴露在光天化日之下。特别令人鼓舞的是，在上海工厂、企业、商店、学校、街道，开展了轰轰烈烈的深入扎实的班组批判、店堂批判、班级批判、里弄批判，到处是声讨中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的阵地。
    上海出现革命大联合的飞跃，是无产阶级革命派和革命群众以无产阶级党性战胜小资产阶级派性的结果。上海无产阶级革命派从斗争实践中得出一条重要经验是，在实现革命大联合的过程中，必须和小资产阶级派性作不调和的斗争；在革命大联合实现以后，仍然要把清除小资产阶级派性、加强无产阶级党性的任务放在重要的地位。对于无产阶级革命派队伍中的小资产阶级思想，只有遵照毛主席的教导，把它引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，才能巩固和发展革命的大联合，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
