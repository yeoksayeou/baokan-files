We, the Communist Party of Burma, the soldiers of the People's Army, the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all progressive forces, are greatly inspired by the news of the armed struggle that has erupted in Darjeeling, India.

We enthusiastically hail: Long live the armed struggle of the Indian revolutionary people!

We firmly believe that the armed struggle of the Indian revolutionary people will surely triumph. This is because their armed struggle concretely applies the contemporary peak of Marxism-Leninism—the universal truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" as expounded by Mao Zedong Thought. It fully meets the demands of the oppressed people of India.

The gunshots of the Indian revolutionary people's armed struggle are a heavy blow to the Indian reactionary rulers, to the reactionaries of all countries headed by U.S. imperialism, and to the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership and the Chinese Khrushchovites.

The Soviet revisionist leadership and the Chinese Khrushchovites have cunningly advocated the "Indian Road." Their so-called "Indian Road" is not the road of revolution for the oppressed people of India, nor is it the road of armed struggle of the people of Darjeeling today. It is the road of advocating the Danji traitor clique and the Indian Communist Party revisionists like Nambudripathy, who are willing to be slaves. It is the road of betraying Marxism-Leninism. They advocate a "peaceful transition" road of capitulation, which is completely contrary to the universal truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" as expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The Danji traitor clique and the Indian Communist Party revisionists have long since abandoned the banner of Marxism-Leninism. They turn a blind eye to the bloody massacres of the Indian people by the Indian National Congress government, to the exploitation by the Indian princes, nobles, landlords, and state monopolies that have caused the poverty and hunger of the Indian people, and cling to the legs of the Indian National Congress government, willingly becoming the running dogs of the reactionary government.

These traitors not only betray the Indian people but also closely collude with the Soviet leadership and the Chinese Khrushchovites, acting as their lackeys, and sabotage the revolutionary movements of various countries. They have sabotaged the armed struggle in Burma. When the Indian reactionary rulers provided money and weapons to the Burmese reactionary rulers in an attempt to extinguish the armed struggle in Burma, these traitors wanted the Communist Party of Burma to follow their "Indian Road." Khrushchov and the Chinese Khrushchovites also wanted the Communist Party of Burma to follow the "Indian Road."

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of Burma has raised the banner of armed struggle and fought against these traitors. Their echoers, however, have become the slaves of the Burmese reactionary rulers, and their prestige has been ruined among the masses, turning them into useless and lifeless entities.

Therefore, based on our experience in the armed struggle in Burma, if a Communist Party is loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, has an armed force absolutely led by the Communist Party, and relies on the broad masses of people led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, then in a long-term war, this party will never be annihilated by the class enemy who is armed to the teeth. The class enemy cannot annihilate this party, but this party can achieve one victory after another, gradually consuming the seemingly powerful counter-revolutionary armed forces with the people's revolutionary armed forces.

The reactionary ruling class, in order to deceive the broad masses of people and sabotage the revolution, has adopted the most despicable means, such as formulating a fake "socialist program," conducting fake "land reforms," fake "nationalizations," establishing fake "cooperatives," fake "unions," fake "peasant associations," declaring fake "neutralism," and so on. However, these counterfeits will eventually be exposed in broad daylight. The people can expose the true nature of these counterfeits, and the mighty Mao Zedong Thought can pierce through the "magic tricks" of these counterfeits.

Based on our own experience, we believe that the armed struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. They apply the universal truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" as expounded by Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, rely on the peasants, take the countryside as the base, and wage a protracted peasant war led by the working class. Therefore, we firmly believe that the revolution in Darjeeling will surely achieve victory.

We believe that such a revolutionary armed struggle, which is advancing on the correct path and has historical significance, is indestructible by any enemy in the world.

The people of Burma and the people of India have had very close ties. We are very excited to hear the news of the glorious Indian people's heroic struggle.

People of the world, including the Indian people, enthusiastically hail the revolutionary spark ignited under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in Darjeeling. This spark will spread throughout India, becoming a blazing inferno that will shake the world!

### 印度武装斗争的星星之火必将燎原

　　印度武装斗争的星星之火必将燎原
　　缅甸　温昂
    我们缅甸共产党人、人民军战士、广大工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切进步力量听到印度大吉岭爆发武装斗争的消息后，感到无比鼓舞。
    我们热烈欢呼：印度革命人民的武装斗争万岁！
    我们深信，印度革命人民的武装斗争必胜。因为他们的武装斗争具体地运用了当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想关于“枪杆子里面出政权”这一放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，它完全符合印度被压迫人民的要求。
    印度革命人民武装斗争的枪声，对印度反动统治者，对以美帝国主义为首的各国反动派，对以苏共领导集团为中心的各国现代修正主义者和中国的赫鲁晓夫是个非常沉重的打击。
    苏修领导集团和中国的赫鲁晓夫曾狡猾地提出过“走印度道路”的口号。他们的所谓“印度道路”，并不是印度被压迫人民革命的道路，不是今天大吉岭人民武装斗争的道路，而是鼓吹丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子南布迪里巴德之流的甘当奴才的道路，是背叛马克思列宁主义的道路。他们宣扬的是一条完全违背毛泽东同志关于“枪杆子里面出政权”这一普遍真理的“和平过渡”投降主义道路。
    丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子早就抛弃了马克思列宁主义的大旗。他们无视印度国大党政府对印度人民的血腥屠杀，无视印度王公贵族、地主和国家垄断资本对印度人民的剥削而造成的印度人民的贫困和饥饿，死抱住国大党政府的大腿不放，甘心充当反动政府的走狗。
    这些叛徒不仅背叛了印度人民，而且密切地勾结苏联领导集团和中国赫鲁晓夫，充当他们的走卒，破坏各国的革命运动。他们就曾经破坏过缅甸的武装斗争。当印度反动统治者向缅甸反动统治者提供金钱和武器援助，企图扑灭缅甸武装斗争的时候，这伙叛徒却要缅甸共产党走他们的“印度道路”，赫鲁晓夫和中国赫鲁晓夫也要缅甸共产党走“印度道路”。
    缅甸共产党在毛泽东思想的指引下，高举武装斗争的旗帜，对这些叛徒进行了斗争。而他们的应声虫，却变成了缅甸反动统治者的奴才，在群众中，他们威信扫地，变成了废物，变成了僵尸。
    因此，根据我们缅甸武装斗争的经验，一个共产党，如果它忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，又拥有一支接受共产党绝对领导的武装部队，并依靠工人阶级领导的、工农联盟为基础的广大人民群众，那么，这个党在长期的战争中就决不会被武装到牙齿的阶级敌人所消灭。阶级敌人消灭不了这个党，而这个党却能取得一个又一个的胜利，使貌似强大的反革命武装被人民革命武装一口一口地吃掉。
    反动统治阶级为了蒙蔽广大人民和破坏革命，采取了最卑劣的手段，制定假“社会主义纲领”，进行假“土地改革”、假“国有化”，成立假的“合作社”、假“工会”、假“农会”，宣布假“中立主义”等等，但是，这些冒牌货终究会暴露在光天化日之下。人民能够揭穿这些冒牌货的真相，威力无穷的毛泽东思想能够戳穿这些冒牌货的“西洋景”。
    我们从自己的经验出发，认为印度革命人民、印度共产党革命派领导的武装斗争是符合毛泽东思想的，他们运用毛泽东思想关于“枪杆子里面出政权”这一普遍真理，发动群众，依靠农民，以农村为根据地，进行由工人阶级领导的持久的农民战争。因此，我们深信，大吉岭的革命一定能够取得胜利。
    我们相信，象这样一场正在正确道路上迈进的、具有历史意义的武装革命，是世界上任何敌人也破坏不了的。
    我们缅甸人民和印度人民曾经有过非常密切的联系，我们听到光荣的印度人民进行英勇斗争的消息感到十分兴奋。
    全世界人民，包括印度人民，热烈欢呼在毛泽东思想指引下点燃起来的大吉岭革命火花。这个火花将燃遍整个印度，变成燎原大火，震撼全世界！
