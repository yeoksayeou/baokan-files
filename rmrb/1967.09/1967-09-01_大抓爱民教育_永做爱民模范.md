Carry out extensive love-the-people education and be a model in loving the people

Leaders from the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, and the three services' leading organs in Beijing held a discussion and decided to immediately launch a new wave of the love-the-people movement in all subordinate organs and troops, establish love-the-people agreements, help the people study and apply Chairman Mao's works, humbly learn from the broad leftist masses, and better complete the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries."

New China News Agency, August 31: Leaders from the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Beijing held a discussion on the morning of August 30. They earnestly studied and enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call to further develop the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement and deployed specific measures to immediately launch the love-the-people movement.

The attendees unanimously agreed that our great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on further developing the support-the-army-and-love-the-people movement have great and far-reaching strategic significance. Supporting the army and loving the people is a manifestation of our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war and people's army. At this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao issues the great call to support the army and love the people, which is a strategic slogan and powerful driving force for advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory. It is the general principle for correctly handling the relationship between the army and revolutionary masses in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of the great commander Chairman Mao, not to disappoint the expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao and the trust of the people, and to forever uphold the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, forever be models in loving the people.

The attendees unanimously agreed to immediately launch extensive and in-depth love-the-people education in all subordinate organs and troops, conduct extensive propaganda activities among the people, and quickly launch a new wave of the love-the-people movement. They require all officers and soldiers to resolutely do the following: forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the greatest way to love the people. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary factions, support the Red Guards, support the broad revolutionary masses, breathe with them, share their fate, be concerned about what they are concerned about, think about what they think about, help them with what they need, promote revolutionary great alliances, and better complete the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries."

To resolutely support the broad leftist masses, the most important thing is to arm the people with Mao Zedong Thought. We must vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the people, help the people study and apply Chairman Mao's works, jointly study and apply the brilliant works of the "Old Three Articles," actively spread the glorious traditions and fine styles of our Party and army, such as emphasizing politics, the Four Firsts, and the Three-Eight Style, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. If there are any shortcomings or errors in the support-left work, we must actively and openly conduct self-criticism, resolutely overcome them, and thoroughly correct them.

Humbly learn from the broad leftist masses in the localities, diligently and conscientiously be the students of the revolutionary masses. Through various forms, frequently visit them as teachers, invite them in as our instructors, and learn all their good ideas, good styles, and good experiences. Forever unite with them, fight with them, and achieve victory with them.

Seriously establish love-the-people agreements. Various organs and troops should formulate practical new love-the-people agreements based on different tasks and specific situations in the areas where they are located. Always be concerned about the people's hardships and do good deeds for the people. Actively help with the autumn harvest and protect the autumn harvest.

Carry out the revolution, promote preparedness, promote work, and promote production. Maintain high revolutionary vigilance, strengthen preparedness, firmly guard the posts, and do a good job. Prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from sabotage and disruption, defend national defense, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Leaders at all levels and responsible comrades must strengthen the leadership of the love-the-people movement, continuously summarize and exchange experiences, promote the in-depth development of the love-the-people movement, and make the military-civilian relationship better and better. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve new merits. (Accompanying photo)
