On the night of September 19, the lights shone brightly at the Baobai Mountain Sandstone Factory in Beijing. People were joyous and excited. The warriors of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps and the Red Rebel Corps gathered in the venue, beginning the first election after the factory achieved revolutionary unity.

Here, the atmosphere was filled with the great unity of the working class. The trust among revolutionary comrades completely replaced the sectarianism and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The two major factions that had just joined hands immediately, based on the principles of the Paris Commune, used secret ballots to elect a new leadership body—the Revolutionary United Action Committee.

The process of nominations, voting, and counting votes proceeded smoothly in a joyous atmosphere.

The election results fully met the wishes of the warriors from both factions. Seven members from the Revolutionary Rebel Corps, which held power, were elected into the leadership core; two comrades from the Red Rebel Corps also became members of the leadership.

However, as the thunderous applause subsided, the warriors of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps began to discuss among themselves: "In the new leadership core, we have more representatives than the Red Rebel Corps. This is not appropriate!"

Amidst the discussions, a squad leader from the Revolutionary Rebel Corps who had just been elected as a leadership member stood up and said: "I have a suggestion. We should change the ratio from seven to two to six to three, and give up one seat to the Red Rebel Corps..."

Before he finished speaking, the warriors of the Red Rebel Corps stood up in unison to object: "We disagree! We firmly disagree!" They said: "We have all united now, we are all one family. The elected comrades are all those we support and endorse."

The suggestion to give up a seat was not accepted; the spirit of modesty further enhanced trust and unity. Unity is strength. The proletarian revolutionary warriors of the Sandstone Factory are using this great strength to carry out the great criticism, to promote revolution and production, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production, welcoming the great National Day!

　　革命者的信任　同志式的谦虚
　　——在砂石厂实现革命大联合后第一次选举会上
    九月十九日夜晚，北京市八宝山砂石厂灯火通明，人们欢天喜地。革命造反大队的战士和红色造反团的战士，熙熙攘攘地走进会场，开始进行全厂实现革命大联合后的第一次选举。
    这里洋溢着工人阶级大团结的气氛，革命同志之间的信任，完全代替了小团体主义和小资产阶级的派性。刚刚携起手来的两大派组织，就立即根据巴黎公社原则，用无记名投票的方式，选举新的领导机构——革命造反联合委员会。
    提名，投票，开票，一直在喜气洋洋中顺利地进行。
    选举的结果，完全符合两派战士的心意。掌权的革命造反大队有七人被选入领导核心；红色造反团的两位同志也成为领导成员。
    可是，雷鸣般的掌声刚落，革命造反大队的战士们就纷纷议论开了：“在新的领导核心里面，我们大队被选上的人，比红色造反团的多得多，这样不合适！”
    在议论声中，只见新当选为领导成员的原革命造反大队的一位中队负责人，站了起来说：我提一个建议，把七比二改为六比三，我们应该让给红色造反团一个席位，……
    他的话音未落，红色造反团的战士不约而同地纷纷站起来反对：“不同意！坚决不同意！”他们说：“我们都联合起来了，都是一家人了，不能再分彼此了。当选的同志，都是我们支持的、拥护的。”
    让席位的建议，没有被接受；谦让的精神，更增进了信任和团结。团结就是力量。砂石厂的无产阶级革命派战士，正把这股巨大力量用来开展革命的大批判，用来抓革命促生产，用革命和生产的双胜利，迎接伟大的国庆节！
