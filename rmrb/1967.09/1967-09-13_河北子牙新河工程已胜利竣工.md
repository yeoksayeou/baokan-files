The triumphant melody of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought resonates across the Hebei Plain: the key project for the control of the Hai River in Hebei Province—the Ziya New River Project—has been completed swiftly, efficiently, and economically by over 300,000 river control troops since last winter. Now, an artificial river 143 kilometers long and 2.5 kilometers wide stands prominently between Xian County and the vicinity of Beidahang in Tianjin City on the central Hebei Plain. The floodwaters of the Ziya River, one of the five major water systems of the Hai River, will now flow more smoothly into the boundless Bohai Sea. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    河北子牙新河工程已胜利竣工
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌响彻了河北平原：河北省根治海河的关键性工程——子牙新河工程，在三十多万治河大军自去冬以来的辛勤劳动下，已经多快好省地胜利竣工。现在，一条长一百四十三公里、宽二点五公里的人工河，引人注目地展现在冀中平原的献县和天津市附近的北大港之间。海河五大水系之一的子牙河的洪水，从此将更加畅通地流进浩瀚无际的渤海。（据新华社）
