Revolutionary peasants of Naxalbari in Darjeeling district and other regions of India, under the leadership of the proletariat, have sounded the trumpet for armed land revolution, inspiring peasants in many other parts of India to rise up and fight for the seizure of land. The revolutionary storm among Indian peasants is forcefully striking at the extremely brutal feudal exploitation system that has long existed in India.

Revisionists attempt to mislead the revolution

The fundamental issue of the Indian revolution, like that of old China, is the peasant question.

The peasant struggles in Naxalbari and other regions have powerfully exposed the reactionary fallacies of the Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists on the issue of Indian peasant land.

The "experts," "scholars," books, and newspapers of the Soviet revisionists, as well as the Indian traitor Dange clique and other Indian revisionists, have maliciously distorted facts, claiming that the Indian countryside has undergone "fundamental changes" since independence, that the Indian National Congress's "land reform" has "struck and weakened feudalism," that feudalism no longer "occupies a dominant position" in Indian villages, and that Indian villages have already "capitalized," and so on. According to their claims, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary tasks in India have already been completed by the Indian National Congress, and now it is only necessary to transition to socialism through parliamentary elections.

The Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists spread these revisionist fallacies with the intention of downplaying the severity of the Indian peasant land issue, covering up the reactionary rule of the Indian National Congress. They praise the Indian National Congress, the maintainer of the feudal system, for "solving the peasant land issue," leading the Indian revolution astray.

They oppose the revolutionary forces of the Indian proletariat from entering the countryside, leading the peasant masses, establishing rural base areas, launching armed land revolutions, and preventing the Indian people from following the victorious path that the Chinese people have taken under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Brutal exploitation remains unchanged on the peasants

The Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists strongly praise the so-called "land reform" of the Indian reactionary government, claiming that it has "objectively weakened the feudal system." This is completely deceitful.

The "land reform" decrees of the Indian reactionary government stipulate the so-called "maximum limit" of land that each person or each peasant household can own, superficially stating that land exceeding the "limit" will be distributed by the government to peasants. However, the "limit" is set extremely high, with some states stipulating that a family of five can own 360 acres (equivalent to 2,160 mu) of land. Therefore, large landlords still own large amounts of land, and it is considered "legal." Moreover, landlords can transfer land to others' names.

The "land reform" law of the Indian National Congress reactionary government also stipulates the abolition of the "zamindari" system during the British rule ("zamindar" is a term in Hindi meaning "landlord," and "zamindari" refers to the landlords recognized or supported by the colonial government who paid a small amount of tax to the colonial government and could then collect heavy rents from peasants). The land owned by these landlords is rented by the government. In reality, this does not change the feudal exploitation relationship at all.

In addition, landlords are allowed to retain a large amount of so-called "self-cultivated land," continuing to engage in feudal exploitation. According to statistics from the Indian Parliament's Estimates Committee in 1966, 20% of the total number of peasant households own 75% of the total land area, while 80% of the total number of households own only 25% of the land. This statistic shows that after the Indian National Congress implemented its so-called "land reform," it is still the case that a small number of landlords and rich peasants own the majority of the land, while the vast majority of poor and landless peasants own very little or no land at all.

Landlords use various excuses to reclaim land rented to peasants for cultivation. This phenomenon of "eviction" was particularly serious when the Indian reactionary government began its fake "land reform," and it continued to occur throughout the country. In the former Bombay State, from 1949 to 1953, the number of evicted peasant households accounted for 47% of the total number of tenant farmers.

After the implementation of the so-called "land reform," the widespread "sharecropping" system still prevails in the vast rural areas of India, which is the system where peasants pay a certain proportion of the harvest as rent to landlords. Although the "land reform" law stipulates that the rent should be one-third, one-fourth, or even one-sixth of the total harvest, the Indian official report admits that the actual rent in various places is generally half, and in some cases it is as high as 60% or more.

The Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists attempt to prove that the "land reform" of the Indian National Congress reactionary government has an "anti-feudal" effect. Therefore, they emphasize that there are already about one-third of the population in Indian villages who are agricultural workers, and they are "wage laborers," a manifestation of the "capitalization" of Indian villages. This is complete nonsense. In fact, just like in old China, the vast majority of agricultural workers in India are merely hired peasants. They are dependent on the land of landlords or plantation owners, suffering from brutal feudal oppression and exploitation. They must obey the landlords' orders day and night, working 10 to 14 hours a day.

Usurious interest rates are a major form of feudal exploitation in Indian villages. In India, the annual interest rate for usury is generally 100%, and in some cases it is as high as 200% to 300%. The situation where poor Indian peasants are born in debt, live in debt, and die in debt, passing on the debt to their descendants, still widely exists.

Armed land revolution is the path to peasant liberation

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out when discussing the villages of colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal China: "The foundation of the feudal exploitation system—the exploitation of peasants by the landlord class—not only remains unchanged but is also combined with the exploitation of comprador capital and usury capital, occupying an obvious advantage in China's social and economic life." This statement also applies to today's India.

The deeper the oppression, the greater the resistance. Indian peasants have finally risen up, taken up arms, and engaged in revolutionary struggle. Indian peasants are the main force of the Indian revolution and the most reliable ally of the Indian proletariat. Without relying on peasants and without carrying out armed land revolution and establishing rural revolutionary base areas, the Indian revolution cannot be victorious. The revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party has already recognized this truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, beginning to enter the countryside, mobilize and organize the peasant masses, and launch armed struggles. This is a major advance in the Indian revolution.

The course of history will thoroughly shatter the various fallacies of modern revisionists. The revolutionary struggle of the Indian people will prove that the path to victory that Chairman Mao has guided the Chinese people to take is also the path for the Indian people. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "It must be emphasized that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of establishing rural revolutionary base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside has, for the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world today, especially for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and its running dogs, an exceptionally prominent and universal practical significance."

　　纳萨尔巴里革命农民吹响了武装土地革命的号角
　　印度农民革命风暴有力冲击残暴的剥削制度
　　毛主席指引中国人民取得胜利的道路也是印度人民的道路
    据新华社讯　本社记者评述：印度大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里等地区的革命农民，在无产阶级领导下，吹响了武装的土地革命的号角，鼓舞着印度其它许多地方的农民纷纷起来开展夺取土地的斗争。印度农民的革命风暴，正在冲击着长期以来在印度一直存在的极端残暴的封建剥削制度。
　　修正主义者妄想把革命引入歧途
    印度革命的基本问题，同旧中国一样，是农民问题。
    纳萨尔巴里等地区的农民斗争，有力地揭穿了苏修和印度修正主义分子在印度农民土地问题上的种种反动谬论。
    苏修的“专家”、“学者”、书籍、报刊以及印度叛徒丹吉集团和其他印修分子，别有用心地歪曲事实，瞎说什么印度农村在独立后产生了“根本变化”，印度国大党的“土地改革”“打击、削弱了封建主义”，印度农村中封建制度已经“不占主要地位”，印度农村已经“资本主义化”等等。按照他们的说法，印度反帝反封建的革命任务都已由国大党完成，现在只要通过议会选举，就可以“和平过渡”到社会主义了。
    苏修和印修散布这些修正主义谬论的目的，是为了抹煞印度的农民土地问题的严重性，替印度国大党反动统治涂脂抹粉。吹捧印度封建制度的维护者国大党“解决了农民土地问题”，把印度革命引入歧途。
    他们反对印度无产阶级的革命力量深入农村，领导农民群众，建立农村根据地，发动武装土地革命，阻止印度人民走中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下所走过的胜利道路。
　　残酷剥削原封不动地压在农民身上
    苏修和印修极力美化印度国大党反动政府的所谓“土地改革”，把它说成是“客观上削弱了封建制度”的。这完全是骗人的鬼话。
    印度反动政府的“土改”法令规定了所谓每个人或每个农户占有土地的“最高限额”，表面上说超过“限额”的土地由政府分配给农民。但是，“限额”定得非常高，有的邦规定五口之家可以占有三百六十英亩（合二千一百六十市亩）土地。因此，大地主照样占有大量土地，而且被认为是“合法”的。此外，地主可以把土地分到别人名下。
    国大党反动政府的“土改法”，还规定废除英国统治时期的“柴明达”制度（“柴明”是印地语“土地”的意思，“达”是“主人”的意思。“柴明达”是英帝国主义在印度所扶植或承认的地主，他们向殖民政府交一点税款，就可向农民征收苛重的地租），这些地主占有的土地由政府收租。实际上，这样做封建剥削关系一点没有改变。
    此外，还让地主保存大量所谓“自耕地”，继续进行封建剥削。据一九六六年印度议会概算委员会的统计，占一亿农户总数百分之二十的农户，占有土地总面积百分之七十五的土地，而占总户数百分之八十的农户，只占有百分之二十五的土地。这个统计表明，在国大党实行所谓的“土地改革”以后，仍然是占农村人口极少数的地主富农拥有最大部分土地，而占农村人口极大多数的贫雇农则土地极少或者完全没有土地。
    地主随时用种种借口，收回租给农民耕作的土地。这种“夺佃”现象在印度反动政府开始搞假“土改”时特别严重，后来继续在全国各地普遍发生。在过去的孟买邦，从一九四九年到一九五三年，被夺佃的农户竟占到原来租田农户总数的百分之四十七。
    在实行所谓“土改”以后，印度广大农村中仍然普遍实行着“分成制”，也就是农民按收成的一定比例向地主交纳实物地租的制度。尽管“土改”法令规定租额为总收成的三分之一、四分之一以至六分之一，但是印度官方报告也承认各地实际租额普遍是二分之一，有的高达百分之六十甚至更多。
    苏修和印修企图证明，国大党反动政府的“土改”有“反封建”的作用，因此他们强调说，印度农村中已经有大约占三分之一人口的农业工人，他们是“工资劳动者”，是印度农村“资本主义化”的表现。这完全是胡说。其实同旧中国一样，印度的农业工人绝大多数只不过是雇农，他们依附于地主或种植园主的土地，受着残酷的封建压迫和剥削。他们白天黑夜都必须听从地主的使唤，每天必须做十到十四小时的苦工。
    骇人听闻的高利贷是印度农村中封建剥削的重要形式之一。在印度，高利贷年利率一般是百分之一百，有的高达百分之二百至三百。印度贫苦农民生于债，长于债，死于债，把债传给后代的情况，仍然广泛地存在。
　　武装的土地革命是农民解放的道路
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在谈到殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的中国的农村时指出：“封建剥削制度的根基——地主阶级对农民的剥削，不但依旧保持着，而且同买办资本和高利贷资本的剥削结合在一起，在中国的社会经济生活中，占着显然的优势。”这个论断，也符合于今天的印度。
    压迫愈深，反抗愈大。印度农民终于起来，拿起武器，进行革命斗争。印度农民是印度革命的主力军，是印度无产阶级最可靠的同盟军。不依靠农民，不进行武装的土地革命，不建立农村革命根据地，印度的革命就不可能胜利。印度共产党革命派，已经认识了这个马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理，开始深入农村，发动和组织农民群众，开展武装斗争，这是印度革命的重大进展。
    历史的进程将要彻底粉碎现代修正主义者的种种谬论。印度人民的革命斗争必将证明，毛主席指引中国人民取得胜利的道路，也是印度人民的道路。正象林彪同志所说的：“必须着重指出，毛泽东同志关于建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市的理论，对于今天世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争，特别是对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争，更是突出地具有普遍的现实意义。”
