The Albanian volleyball team from Tirana played a friendly match against the men's volleyball team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing this evening. The shooting team also conducted friendly matches with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's August First Shooting Team yesterday and today. With this, all the friendly matches in Beijing have been concluded.

During each competition and training session, athletes from both China and Albania study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the sayings of Comrade Enver Hoxha together, sing songs based on Mao's quotations, and use the teachings of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha to guide their actions.

The Albanian athletes' visit and competitions in China have further strengthened the fraternal and combative friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, which is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.
