"The barrel of a gun is the key to political power." This irrefutable truth was proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, based on the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and summing up the experiences of international and domestic class struggles. It is guiding the world's proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations in their victorious struggles.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev has been scheming to oppose the proletariat seizing political power through the barrel of a gun.

In the autumn of 1945, after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Chinese revolution reached a new turning point. The representatives of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, came down from the mountains to seize the fruits of victory. With one hand holding a knife and the other waving the banner of "peace talks," they demanded that we hand over our guns. Chairman Mao responded sharply: "The people's armed forces, every gun and every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." "If there were opportunism at this time, it would be not to struggle for it and voluntarily hand over the fruits that the people should have to Chiang Kai-shek."

The Chinese Khrushchev is precisely the opportunist criticized by Chairman Mao. He openly advocated that "the army should also be reorganized, our army becoming the national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense corps... and canceling the party organization within the army..."

This is shameless betrayal!

To cover up his traitorous actions, he also fabricated some so-called "reasons."

First, he says: "Because our army is the 'Communist army,' 'England and America do not recognize it.'"

What does "England and America not recognizing it" mean? It simply means that the Anglo-American imperialists do not recognize us.

The Anglo-American imperialists are the sworn enemies of the Chinese people. They never forget to eliminate the revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people. They provide money and guns to fully support the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in launching a civil war. Under these circumstances, advocating the surrender of the army and begging for their recognition, what is this if not shameless betrayal?

Second, he says: "Our army can be 'legalized.'"

We must ask the Chinese Khrushchev, whose "law" do you want to follow?

In a class society, there is no such thing as a super-class law. Either you follow the bourgeoisie's "law" and oppose the proletariat, or you follow the proletariat's "law" and oppose the bourgeoisie; either you follow Chiang Kai-shek's "law," surrender the army, abandon the revolution, and conspire with Chiang Kai-shek, or you follow the law of the revolutionary people, carry the revolution to the end, and establish a new China for the people.

Chairman Mao's words represent the voice of hundreds of millions of people: "We did not hand over the army, so we have no legal status; we are 'lawless and heaven-defying.' Our responsibility is to the people."

To the people, that is our law!

Third, he says: "We can achieve the 'nationalization' of the army."

What kind of nation? At that time, China faced two futures: either to establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat, or to return to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal nation under the rule of big landlords and big bourgeoisie; there is no middle way. To establish a people's democratic dictatorship, we must insist on the people's army and armed struggle. This is the wish of the revolutionary people across the nation and the expectation of the revolutionary people around the world.

What kind of "nationalization" of the army does the Chinese Khrushchev propose? It is to "cancel the party organization within the army" and "the party stops directly commanding the army, unified under the Ministry of Defense."

The Ministry of Defense that the Chinese Khrushchev refers to here is the "Ministry of Defense of the Central Government of the Kuomintang," with at most a few so-called "Communist Party members" like the Chinese Khrushchev going in to "hold office." Such a Ministry of Defense, of course, would obey Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Such "nationalization" is nothing but complete class surrender!

The Chinese Khrushchev defends himself by saying: "By making this concession, we can make the Kuomintang army break away from Chiang Kai-shek." This is a shameless lie. The reactionary army is the lifeline of Chiang Kai-shek. After the end of the War of Resistance, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, boasted that they would completely eliminate the revolutionary forces within three to six months. How can one imagine that this counter-revolutionary leader would give up his army?

The "nationalization" of the army by the Chinese Khrushchev is a complete and thorough class surrender.

Fourth, he says: "In exchange for national 'democratization,' that is, 'the army takes a step back, the nation makes great progress.'"

We have seen this "democratization." During the First Civil War, Chen Duxiu did not want leadership and handed over the army. Did this bring "democracy"? But what Chiang Kai-shek gave was the April 12 massacre, giving the Communists' heads for "democracy"!

This "democratization" has also occurred in the world. After World War II, the leader of the French Communist Party, Maurice Thorez, handed over the army and in exchange got the position of vice premier, but the broad masses got nothing but unadulterated bourgeois dictatorship. Thorez's vice premier position did not last long.

This step cannot be taken. If the revolutionary army takes this step, it will be the failure of the revolution, a great historical retreat!

"The barrel of a gun is the key to political power." "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." In a class society, this is an eternal truth. Whoever betrays this truth betrays the proletarian revolution. No matter how much the Chinese Khrushchev argues, he cannot cover up his traitorous stance!

    痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的无耻背叛	蒋家羚　江见鲸
    “枪杆子里面出政权”。这个颠扑不破的真理，是我们伟大的领袖毛主席，根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，总结了国际、国内阶级斗争的经验，提出的著名论断。它正在指引着世界无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族胜利战斗。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却处心积虑地反对无产阶级用枪杆子夺取政权。
    一九四五年秋天，抗日战争胜利结束，中国革命到了一个新的转折关头。大地主大资产阶级的代表蒋介石反动派下山来抢夺胜利果实了。他一手拿着刀，一手却打着“和谈”的幌子，要我们交枪。毛主席针锋相对地指出：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫就是毛主席所批判的机会主义者。他公然鼓吹什么“军队也要整编，我们的军队成为国军、国防军、保安军、自卫队……，在军队中是取消党的组织……”。
    这是无耻的背叛！
    为了掩盖叛徒行径，他还制造了一些所谓“理由”。
    一曰：因为我们的军队是“共产军”，“英美不承认”。
    什么“英美不承认”，无非是英美帝国主义不承认我们罢了。
    美英帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的死敌。他们念念不忘消灭中国人民的革命武装力量。他们出钱出枪全力支持蒋介石反动派发动内战。在这种情况下，主张交出军队，乞求他们的承认，这不是无耻的背叛又是什么？
    二曰：我军就可以“合法化”。
    我们要质问中国赫鲁晓夫，你要合那家的“法”？
    在阶级社会里，决不存在什么超阶级的法。要么合资产阶级的“法”，反对无产阶级，要么合无产阶级的“法”，反对资产阶级；要么合蒋介石的“法”，交出军队，放弃革命，跟蒋介石同流合污，要么合革命人民的“法”，将革命进行到底，建立人民的新中国。
    毛主席的话代表了亿万人民的心声：“我们没有交出军队，所以没有合法地位，我们是‘无法无天’。我们的责任，是向人民负责。”
    向人民负责，这就是我们的法！
    三曰：可以换得军队的“国家化”。
    什么国家？当时的中国就面临着两个前途：不是建立无产阶级领导的人民民主专政的国家，就是回到大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家，中间道路是没有的。要建立人民民主专政的国家，就得坚持人民的军队，坚持武装斗争。这是全国革命人民的愿望，也是全世界革命人民的期望。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的军队“国家化”是什么货色呢？就是“在军队中取消党的组织”，“党停止对军队的直接指挥，统一于国防部”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在这里所说的国防部，就是国民党“中央政府的国防部”，最多有几个象中国赫鲁晓夫这样的“共产党人”进去“当官”而已。这样的国防部当然是听命于蒋介石，听命于国民党反动派。这样的“国家化”不是彻头彻尾的阶级投降又是什么？
    中国赫鲁晓夫辩解说：“用这个让步换得了国民党军队脱离蒋介石。”这是无耻的谎言。反动军队是蒋介石的命根子。抗战结束以后，蒋介石反动派在美帝国主义扶植下，叫嚣要在三个月到六个月内彻底消灭革命力量。怎么能够想象这个反革命头子会放弃军队？
    中国赫鲁晓夫的军队“国家化”是完全彻底的阶级投降主义。
    四曰：换得全国“民主化”，就是“军队让一步，全国大进步”。
    这个“民主化”我们见过。第一次国内革命战争时，陈独秀不要领导权，交出了军队，这可以得到“民主”了吧！但蒋介石给的是“四·一二”大屠杀，给的是共产党员掉脑袋的“民主”！
    这个“民主化”世界上也有过。法国共产党头头多列士，在二次大战后交出了军队，结果换来了一个副总理的位子，而广大人民呢？得到的仍然是不折不扣的资产阶级专政。多列士的副总理，也没有保持多久。
    这一步让不得，如果革命军队让了这一步，那就是革命的失败，就是历史的大倒退！
    “枪杆子里面出政权”。“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在阶级社会里，这是千古永恒的真理。谁背叛这条真理，就是背叛无产阶级革命。任凭中国赫鲁晓夫百般狡辩，也无法掩盖他的叛徒立场！
