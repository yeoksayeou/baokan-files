	Mao Zedong Thought's radiant light illuminates the world.
	Some of Chairman Mao's brilliant works have been published in Pakistan.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, September 8th: Some of Chairman Mao's brilliant works have recently been translated and published in East and West Pakistan.

	In the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka, seven of Chairman Mao's brilliant works have recently been published in Bengali. These works are: "On the Question of Leadership," "On Policy," "Combat Liberalism," "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," "The Preface and Postscript to 'Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan'," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work."

	The publisher's preface to the Bengali translation of these seven works states: Chairman Mao is the shining sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. Chairman Mao "has made outstanding contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism, making Marxism-Leninism shine even brighter in the eyes of the world's proletariat."

	The preface states: "Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the 700 million people of China, but also the leader of the people of all countries who are struggling for liberation. As part of the anti-imperialist peoples of Asia and Africa, we believe it is our duty to familiarize ourselves with Mao Zedong's teachings and works to solve the various complex problems of humanity. ... We sincerely hope that our people will be able to find the correct path in Mao Zedong's works, like finding a guiding light in the dark."

	In West Pakistan, three of Chairman Mao's brilliant works have recently been translated and published in Urdu: "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work," and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas."

	The publisher's note to the Urdu translation of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" states: The contemporary Lenin—Mao Zedong—solves in this article some important problems that Marx and Lenin could not solve at their time, such as class struggle in socialist society and the distinction between the two different types of contradictions between the people and the enemy. Given the widespread betrayal of modern revisionism today, the importance and role of this article are even greater.

	The publisher's note to the Urdu translation of "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" states: "Once the proletarian party, leaders, and workers are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they will stand at such a height that they can eradicate errors and throw them all into the garbage heap of history."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi: Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has been published in Urdu in Lahore, West Pakistan, and has been warmly welcomed by the Pakistani people.

	Pakistani famous writer Muhammad Safdar Mir in the preface points out that Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest leader of the world revolutionary movement in contemporary times. His theory is the crystallization of long-term revolutionary struggle practice.

　　毛泽东思想的闪闪金光照耀全世界
    毛主席的一些光辉著作在巴基斯坦出版
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第八日电　毛主席的一些光辉著作，最近在东、西巴基斯坦陆续译成当地文字出版。
    在东巴基斯坦首府达卡，最近用孟加拉文出版了毛主席的七篇光辉著作的节译本。这些著作是：《关于领导方法的若干问题》、《论政策》、《反对自由主义》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》。
    出版者在这七篇著作的孟加拉文译本的前言中说，毛主席是革命人民心中的光辉的太阳，毛主席“对马克思列宁主义的发展作出了杰出的贡献，使马克思列宁主义在世界无产阶级眼中更加光芒四射。”
    前言说：“毛泽东不仅是七亿中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界为争取解放而斗争的各国人民的领袖。作为反帝的亚非人民的一部分，我们认为自己有义务熟悉毛泽东的教导和著作，以便解决人类的各种复杂问题，……我们热切希望我国人民将能从毛泽东著作中找到一条正确的道路，象在黑暗中找到指路明灯一样。”
    在西巴基斯坦，最近用乌尔都文翻译出版了毛主席的三篇光辉著作：《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》。
    出版者在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的译本的按语中说：当代的列宁——毛泽东在这篇文章中解决了马克思和列宁当时所不能解决的一些重要问题，如社会主义社会中的阶级斗争、区分人民内部和敌我之间这两类不同性质的矛盾等问题。鉴于目前现代修正主义的普遍叛变，这篇文章的重要性和作用是更大了。
    出版者在《关于纠正党内的错误思想》的译本的按语中说：“无产阶级的政党、领袖以及工人一旦用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的武器武装起来，就会站在这样的高度，能够根除错误和把它们通通抛进历史的垃圾堆里去。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》已在西巴基斯坦拉合尔用乌尔都文出版，受到巴基斯坦人民的热烈欢迎。
    巴基斯坦著名作家穆罕默德·萨夫达尔·米尔在序言中指出，毛泽东主席是当代世界革命运动最伟大的领袖。他的理论是长期进行革命斗争实践的结晶。
