The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1957, his reactionary theory of "everyone's dictatorship" was another piece of evidence of his attempt to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. He first maliciously attacked the proletariat, saying it also has a dark side and produces bureaucratism. Then, mimicking the tone of the Soviet Khrushchev, he said: "The dictatorship of the proletariat... we don't talk about it. If we do, people might feel it's just our dictatorship. If we don't, it makes people feel it's everyone's dictatorship."

What a "everyone's dictatorship"! The Chinese Khrushchev clearly speaks for the bourgeoisie, yet he hesitates to say "everyone"; he clearly wants to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, yet he stutters about "everyone's dictatorship." Marxism-Leninism tells us that dictatorship is the power to suppress the enemy class. If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's words, the "entire people" become "one family," so who needs "everyone's dictatorship"? Who does this "everyone" dictate to?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution." It is precisely on this primary question of the revolution that the Chinese Khrushchev completely betrays Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, creating the counter-revolutionary theory of "everyone's dictatorship." The history of class struggle tells us that since the division of classes in human society, the "everyone" in class society has always been "divided into two," never "one family." There has never been an "everyone's dictatorship." The inhuman slave owners, the wolf-like landlords, the bone-sucking capitalists—they have been the exploiting classes of thousands of years of class society. They have raised a large number of armies, set up courts and prisons, forming a reactionary state machine to carry out ruthless counter-revolutionary dictatorship over the slave class, peasant class, and working class.

In a socialist society, there are still classes and class struggle, so there certainly will not be any "everyone's dictatorship." Lenin said: "From a capitalist society developing towards communism to a communist society, one must pass through a 'political transitional period,' and the state in this period can only be the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." "Because no one else and no other path can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist class." Therefore, we must always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat and continuously strengthen it. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: The dictatorship of the proletariat, "for the victorious people, is something they cannot do without for even a moment, like cloth, beans, and grain. It is a good thing, a protective talisman, a family heirloom. Until foreign imperialism and domestic classes are completely and thoroughly eliminated, this talisman must absolutely not be discarded." Once the proletariat and the working people lose the dictatorship of the proletariat, they will lose everything and face the fate of the party's demise, the nation's demise, and personal demise.

The Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of "everyone's dictatorship" is extremely clear in its intentions. He is not advocating for the actual non-existent "everyone's dictatorship" of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, but rather to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is the essence of the whole issue. We must thoroughly criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev's "everyone's dictatorship" and fight to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    “大家专政”就是取消无产阶级专政	山东师范学院　慨而慷战斗队
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对无产阶级专政。一九五七年，他提出的“大家专政”的反动理论，便是他妄图取消无产阶级专政的又一罪证。他先是恶毒攻击无产阶级“也有阴暗的一面，产生官僚主义”，接着就学着苏联赫鲁晓夫的腔调说：“无产阶级专政……我们不讲。讲了，可能使人感到只是我们专政。不讲，就使人感到是大家专政”。
    好一个“大家专政”！中国赫鲁晓夫明明是为资产阶级说话，却偏要忸忸怩怩地说什么“大家”；明明是要取消无产阶级专政，却吞吞吐吐地说什么“大家专政”。马克思列宁主义告诉我们，专政是对敌对阶级行镇压之权。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，“全民”都成“一家”了，还要什么“大家专政”呢？这个“大家”向谁专政呢？
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”正是在这个革命的首要问题上，中国赫鲁晓夫彻头彻尾地背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，制造了“大家专政”的反革命理论。阶级斗争的历史告诉我们，自从人类分化为阶级以后，阶级社会中的“大家”从来都是“一分为二”的，从来就不是“一家”。也从来没有一个“大家专政”。绝灭人性的奴隶主，狠如豺狼的地主，敲骨吸髓的资本家，他们是几千年来阶级社会的剥削阶级，他们豢养了一大批军队，设置了法庭监狱，构成反动的国家机器，对奴隶阶级、农民阶级、工人阶级实行残酷的反革命专政。
    在社会主义社会，仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争，当然也绝对不会有什么“大家专政”。列宁说：“从向着共产主义发展的资本主义社会过渡到共产主义社会，非经过一个‘政治上的过渡时期’不可，而这个时期的国家只能是无产阶级的革命专政。”“因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”所以，我们必须念念不忘无产阶级专政，不断强化无产阶级专政。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：无产阶级专政，“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”无产阶级和劳动人民一旦丧失了无产阶级专政，就会失去一切，就要亡党、亡国、亡头。
    中国赫鲁晓夫提出“大家专政”的反革命谬论，用心是极为明显的。他并不是要搞那个实际并不存在的无产阶级和资产阶级结合的“大家专政”，而是要取消无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政。这就是全部问题的实质所在。我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫“大家专政”的黑货彻底批倒、批臭，为捍卫无产阶级专政而斗争！
