	Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength, but also a comparison of human strength and human hearts. Military and economic strength must be grasped by people.

　　毛主席语录
    武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。
                                        《论持久战》
