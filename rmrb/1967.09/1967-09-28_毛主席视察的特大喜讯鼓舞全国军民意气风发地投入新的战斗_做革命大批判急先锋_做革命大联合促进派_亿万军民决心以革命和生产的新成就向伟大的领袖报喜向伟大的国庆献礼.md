The great news of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Cultural Revolution has been met with enthusiastic celebrations by the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country. In recent days, celebrations have swept through cities and countryside nationwide. Inspired by this great news, hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel are brimming with enthusiasm and fighting spirit. The tide of revolutionary criticism is surging, the torrent of revolutionary unity is rolling forward, and both revolution and production are showing a great situation. The broad masses of revolutionaries and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, with extremely enthusiastic and excited hearts, have expressed their determination to firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to be the vanguards of revolutionary criticism, the promoters of revolutionary unity, and the models of grasping revolution, promoting production, and supporting the army and loving the people. They will use new achievements in revolution and production to report to the great leader Chairman Mao and to present gifts to the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Qinghai, and other cities and countryside, as well as the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, have been reviewing with excitement the glorious victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, the supreme commander of the people of the whole country. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do. Following Chairman Mao is victory!"

In the provinces and municipalities of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, where the great leader Chairman Mao has personally inspected, revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity have further developed in recent days, and new achievements in production have continuously emerged. By the afternoon of September 27, 79 systems and units in Changsha City had achieved revolutionary unity under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In Henan, large enterprises such as the Luoyang Tractor Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory have established unified revolutionary mass organizations on the basis of revolutionary unity. In Shanghai, many factories, schools, and institutions that have achieved revolutionary unity have established revolutionary committees in the past few days. In the past few days, the metallurgy, instrument, chemical, machinery, light industry, and textile industries have had good news frequently, with many factories completing or overfulfilling the third quarter's state plan ahead of schedule, and many factories successfully trial-producing major new products. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Wuhan Yangtze River Navigation Company have launched a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production. Since September, the company's cargo volume has significantly increased compared to the previous month, and in the past two days, the daily cargo volume has exceeded the average daily production level since September. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Pingxiang Coal Company in Jiangxi, with boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been vigorously promoting revolution and production. The labor efficiency and daily coal production of the entire mine have improved.

The great news of Chairman Mao's inspection has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Tianjin, Baotou, Hohhot, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Yinchuan, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou, and Nanning. In the past few days, in Tianjin, Xi'an, Hohhot, Kunming, and other places, batches of factories, mines, institutions, and schools have achieved revolutionary unity. After achieving revolutionary unity, the stevedores of Tianjin New Port have created new production achievements. They said excitedly: "The capitalist reactionary line proposed and promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev divided us into two factions. The latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao have guided us to unite. We will fight for Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, promote production, and complete the port's production tasks excellently." The proletarian revolutionaries of the Chengdu Postal and Telecommunications Materials Factory, who have already achieved revolutionary unity, have increased their enthusiasm after hearing the great news of Chairman Mao's inspection. On September 26, they successfully trial-produced a lead press, increasing work efficiency by eight times and solving the key production problem that had not been solved in the factory for many years. In the past two days, 11 mines under the Yunnan Provincial Coal Industry Administration have also achieved revolutionary unity throughout the system and established revolutionary committees.

The broad soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of "three-in-one" and "two supports," as well as on the border and coastal defenses, have expressed their determination in recent days' celebrations to achieve new and greater results in response to Chairman Mao's greatest concern. The soldiers and officers have written determination letters expressing a common vow: They will definitely always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite more closely with the proletarian revolutionaries, be the promoters of revolutionary unity, and the main force of revolutionary criticism, making new contributions to the Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in Kunming, guarding the southwestern border of the motherland, sent dozens of propaganda teams to the local communes and production brigades after hearing the great news of Chairman Mao's inspection, bringing the inspiring news to the poor and lower-middle peasants of all ethnic groups. The soldiers and officers stationed at the foot of Cangshan Mountain and by the shores of Erhai Lake held a rally with the local proletarian revolutionaries. At the rally, military and civilian personnel unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their actions, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, further carry out revolutionary criticism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The naval and air force front-line duty units and border guards wrote in their oaths to Chairman Mao that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said: "Dearest Chairman Mao! Your health is our greatest happiness. Defending you and defending the motherland is our greatest glory. We will increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, build an iron wall on the sea, in the air, and on the border, and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to defend the iron-clad proletarian dictatorship of the motherland and achieve new merits."
