Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" has sounded the charge for further deepening the great revolutionary criticism. At this crucial juncture in the decisive battle between the two headquarters, the Red Guards of our Shijian Middle School once again excitedly recall our close comrade Lu Ronggen and his heroic deeds in fighting against the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu.

Lu Ronggen is a classmate of ours in Class 2 of Grade 11. In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, he closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and displayed the fearless spirit of "daring to sacrifice oneself and daring to pull the emperor from his horse." He verbally and in writing denounced the number three capitalist-roader in the Party, Tao Zhu, and with irrefutable facts exposed the crimes of this counter-revolutionary revisionist.

As early as last May, Lu Ronggen discovered that Tao Zhu, who wore the label of "old revolutionary," had many articles in tune with the "Three Family Village" clique, fiercely attacking Chairman Mao, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. With the resolve to defend Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao at the cost of his life, Lu Ronggen took Mao Zedong Thought as his weapon, worked day and night to carefully examine and analyze Tao Zhu's articles "Ideals, Morals, Spiritual Life" and "Thought, Emotion, Eloquence," and from the different versions of the revisions, he caught Tao Zhu's black hand. From a large amount of materials, he saw that Tao Zhu was completely a counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag. Therefore, he wrote two batches of big-character posters totaling about twenty thousand words to attack Tao Zhu. At this time, he was persecuted, besieged, and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line. However, Lu Ronggen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, remained unshaken. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, he told his classmates, "People like Tao Zhu are very dangerous near Chairman Mao!" "As long as Tao Zhu is not overthrown, I will not rest easy." On July 29 of last year, he wrote another seven-thousand-word critical article exposing Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary face.

On August 18 of last year, our Red Commander-in-Chief Mao Zedong and Vice Commander Lin Biao received a hundred thousand Red Guards and revolutionary masses, giving Lu Ronggen immense encouragement. He decided to go to Beijing to thoroughly expose Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary face. However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee were terrified of Lu Ronggen's revolutionary actions. They threatened him and obstructed him. Nevertheless, Lu Ronggen was not intimidated. On October 12 of last year, he took his four volumes of writings, with the resolve to defend Chairman Mao's revolution, broke through numerous obstacles, and arrived at Chairman Mao's side. As soon as he arrived in Beijing, he immediately plunged into intense battle, working through the night to write big-character posters. He spent nearly a month's effort, and on November 7 of last year, he posted his first big-character poster attacking Tao Zhu at Tsinghua University. On November 20 of last year, a big-character poster written by Lu Ronggen, titled "Firing Heavy Artillery Directly at Tao Zhu," appeared in the courtyard of the Propaganda Department's "Hell of Yama." This was a proclamation denouncing Tao Zhu, breaking the stale air of the "Hell of Yama" and shocking Beijing City. Tao Zhu was taken aback, jumping with rage, and immediately launched a fierce counterattack. Just two hours after this revolutionary big-character poster appeared, the walls of the old Propaganda Department were covered with big-character posters attacking Lu Ronggen, slandering him as a "counter-revolutionary." The next day, Tao Zhu personally gave a black report, viciously attacking the revolutionary young warrior Lu Ronggen, and shamelessly patting himself on the back to protect himself.

However, all this did not shake Lu Ronggen's confidence and determination. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to fight, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," with astonishing willpower, he disregarded the onslaught of illness, and with all his heart and soul, on December 1 of last year, he posted a second batch of big-character posters, totaling more than ten thousand words, in the courtyard of the old Propaganda Department. The title was "Firing Again at Tao Zhu," striking at Tao Zhu's vital points. The two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, who was a human in the open and a ghost in the dark, played the two-faced trick of saying on the one hand, "You can post big-character posters against me, promoting democracy," and on the other hand, even more viciously sending people to tail Lu Ronggen, and calling the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee to investigate Lu Ronggen's political history and family background, fabricating black materials, intending to put this revolutionary young warrior to death.

The long-term fierce struggle caused Lu Ronggen to suffer physically. In early December, on his way back to Shanghai, he fell ill in Wuxi. Even in the hospital, he was still thinking about fighting against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Even when he was on his deathbed, he was still thinking about exposing and criticizing Tao Zhu. When classmates who came to visit him told him the news of the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu being pulled out, he said passionately, "After I recover from my illness, I will further expose Tao Zhu's counter-revolutionary crimes!" But a few days later, our comrade Lu Ronggen ended his young life.

Although Lu Ronggen has left us, his revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude will forever inspire us to move forward! We must learn well from Lu Ronggen's fearless revolutionary spirit, and forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. We must firmly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the transformation of our worldview, and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. We resolutely respond to the battle call of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary great unity, thoroughly fight down and thoroughly expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters.

Last year, the revolutionary young warriors of Shijian Middle School in Shanghai, Lu Ronggen, with his fearless revolutionary spirit, exposed the crimes of the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and was severely attacked and persecuted by Tao Zhu, suffering great harm to his body and mind, and unfortunately died of illness. Today, the revolutionary teachers and students of Shijian Middle School in Shanghai are determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of our comrade Lu Ronggen, and from a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint, thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu!

    学习陆荣根同学大无畏的革命精神
    上海市时代中学革命小将
    姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》的发表，吹响了进一步深入地开展革命的大批判的进军号。在两个司令部决战的这样重要的关头，我们时代中学的红卫兵小将又一次激动地想起我们的亲密战友陆荣根同学，想起他同反革命两面派陶铸作斗争的英勇事迹。
    陆荣根是我们高二
  （2）班的同学。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗中，他紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，高举革命的批判大旗，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，口诛笔伐党内第三号最大的走资本主义道路当权派陶铸，以无可辩驳的事实揭露了这个反革命修正主义分子的罪行。
    还在去年五月份，陆荣根同学就发现挂着“老革命”招牌的陶铸有许多文章跟“三家村”之流唱一个调子，大肆攻击毛主席，攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社。陆荣根同学怀着誓死保卫毛主席和毛主席的革命路线的豪情壮志，以毛泽东思想为武器，废寝忘食地仔细查阅和剖析了陶铸的《理想，情操，精神生活》和《思想·感情·文采》等文章，并且从不同版本的删改处抓住了陶铸的黑手。他从大量的材料中看出陶铸完全是一个打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派。于是，他先后写出了两批共约两万多字的炮轰陶铸的大字报。就在这个时候，他受到了资产阶级反动路线的迫害、围攻和打击。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的陆荣根毫不动摇。他满怀着对毛主席无限热爱的心情对同学说：“陶铸这样的人物，在毛主席身边很危险啊！”“陶铸一天不打倒，我一天不放心。”去年七月二十九日，他又写出了七千多字的批判文章，揭发陶铸的反革命面目。
    去年八月十八日，我们的红司令毛主席和林副统帅，接见了百万红卫兵小将和革命群众，给陆荣根以无比巨大的鼓舞。他决定上北京彻底揭穿陶铸的反革命嘴脸。可是，上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对陆荣根的革命行动怕得要死。他们威吓他，阻挠他。然而，陆荣根没有被吓倒。去年十月十二日，他带着雄文四卷，怀着誓死保卫毛主席的革命激情，冲破重重阻力，到了毛主席身边。他一到北京，立即投入了紧张的战斗，通宵达旦地赶写大字报。他花了将近一个月的心血，在去年十一月七日将他第一张炮轰陶铸的大字报贴在清华大学。去年十一月二十日，中宣部阎王殿大院里接着出现了陆荣根写的长达一万多字、题为《重炮口对准陶铸猛轰》的巨幅大字报。这是一张声讨陶铸的檄文，冲破了阎王殿的沉闷空气，轰动了北京城。陶铸慌了手脚，暴跳如雷，立即进行疯狂反扑。就在这张革命大字报出现两小时后，旧中宣部的墙上出现了许多围攻陆荣根的大字报，竟然诬蔑他是“反革命”。第二天陶铸又亲自出马作了一个黑报告，恶毒地攻击革命小将陆荣根，并且无耻地朝自己脸上贴金，来保护他自己。
    但是，这一切都动摇不了陆荣根的信心和决心。他遵照毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，以惊人的毅力，不顾病魔的侵袭，呕心沥血地在去年十二月一日又在旧中宣部大院内贴出第二批长一万多字的大字报，题目是《再向陶铸开炮》，猛击陶铸的要害。明里是人、暗中是鬼的陶铸，大耍两面派手法，一面假惺惺地说，“可以贴我的大字报，发扬民主”；一面变本加厉地派人跟踪陆荣根，还打电话给上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，要他们调查陆荣根的政治历史和家庭情况，大整黑材料，要将这位革命小将置于死地。
    长期的严酷斗争，使陆荣根同学身体遭到了损害。他在十二月上旬回上海途中，到无锡就病倒了。他在医院里，仍然念念不忘与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，甚至在他生命垂危的时候，还念念不忘揭发和批判陶铸。当去看望他的同学把反革命两面派陶铸被揪出来的胜利消息告诉他时，他满怀激情地说：“等病好以后，我还要进一步揭发陶铸的反革命罪行！”可是没有几天，我们的陆荣根同学就结束了他年轻的生命。
    陆荣根同学虽然离开了我们，但他的革命精神和科学态度永远激励着我们前进！我们一定要很好地学习陆荣根同学大无畏的革命精神，永远忠于伟大的领袖毛主席和毛主席的革命路线。我们一定要狠抓毛主席著作的学习，狠抓世界观的改造，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。我们坚决响应毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，实现革命的大联合，彻底斗倒斗臭中国的赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部。（附图片）
    去年，上海时代中学革命小将陆荣根以大无畏的革命精神，揭发了反革命两面派陶铸反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，因而遭到了陶铸的严重打击和迫害，身心遭到极大损害，最后不幸病逝。今天，上海时代中学的革命师生决心学习战友陆荣根同志的革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把反革命两面派陶铸彻底批倒批臭！
