The handed-over ceremony of the Sana'a Cotton Spinning and Weaving Printing and Dyeing Mill, which was built with China's aid, was grandly held here on the 25th.

Today, the Sana'a Textile Mill is filled with a festive atmosphere. The national flags of China and Yemen are flying high in the sky above the textile mill. Chinese and Yemeni builders, filled with boundless excitement, gathered together to warmly celebrate the handover of the Sana'a Textile Mill to production.

Chinese experts and more than a thousand Yemeni male and female workers, each wearing a shining Mao Zedong badge on their chests, shouted slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the people of China and Yemen!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" The textile mill was filled with these passionate voices.

High-ranking officials of the Yemeni government, high-ranking military officers, prominent figures, and the people, as well as foreign diplomats stationed in Yemen, attended the ceremony.

Yemeni President Saleh delivered a speech at the ceremony. He said, "We thank the great Chinese people for their aid in every engineering project. The Hodeidah-Sana'a road and the Sana'a Textile Mill, which were built with China's help, will never be forgotten by the people. The construction of the Sana'a Textile Mill proves that the Yemeni people can rely on their own strength to build their country."

Chinese Charge d'Affaires to Yemen Zheng Kangping, in his speech, pointed out, "The completion of the Sana'a Textile Mill is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the front of China's foreign aid. This is another heavy blow to the imperialists and reactionaries by the people of China and Yemen. The people of China and Yemen have forged deep friendship in their common struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, and now they are further deepening this friendship through economic cooperation. Today's handover of this factory is another symbol of the new development of friendship between the people of China and Yemen."

The chairman of the management committee of the textile mill and representatives of the male and female workers of the textile mill all highly praised the work of the Chinese experts and the development of Sino-Yemeni friendship. They enthusiastically sang the praises of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by the cheers and applause of the Yemeni workers. The workers shouted, "Long live the friendship between the people of China and Yemen!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Many Yemeni workers said, "Today is the happiest day of our lives. Chairman Mao sent Chinese experts to build the Sana'a Textile Mill for us. We will forever remember this."

President Saleh finally cut the ribbon to mark the start of operations for the Sana'a Textile Mill.

The Sana'a Cotton Spinning and Weaving Printing and Dyeing Mill is a modern textile printing and dyeing integrated enterprise built by the Chinese government at the request of the Yemeni government. It includes three parts: ginning, weaving, and printing and dyeing, and has self-sufficient power generation and water supply facilities.
