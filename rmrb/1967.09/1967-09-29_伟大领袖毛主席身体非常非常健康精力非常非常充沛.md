Great Leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health and full of energy

Chairman Mao was very pleased to hear the report of your downing of an American-made U-2 spy plane from the Kuomintang bandits. This is the greatest commendation and encouragement for you.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers enthusiastically shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories for the people.

New China News Agency, September 28th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force held a grand celebration meeting this afternoon in a certain place in East China to celebrate the great victory of shooting down an American-made U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft by a certain unit of the Air Force on September 8th, and to commend the units and personnel who participated in the battle. The officers and soldiers participating in the meeting and the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat enthusiastically shouted: This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is a brilliant achievement of the officers and soldiers of the participating units who responded to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness! They resolutely declared: We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement the great instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution, promote preparedness, promote work, and promote production," and achieve new victories for the people in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national defense.

The celebration meeting was filled with the joy of victory. In the center of the venue, there was a giant portrait of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao. Mao's quotations were hung on both sides of the venue. The singing of Mao's quotations and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" echoed throughout the venue.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East is Red."

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, vice director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and leader of the Nanjing Military Region, and Comrade Yu Lijin, leader of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, attended the meeting.

Also attending the meeting were leaders from the Nanjing Military Region, Nanjing Military Region Air Force, Shanghai Garrison, East China Fleet, and Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, as well as more than a thousand representatives from the troops and local revolutionary mass organizations.

At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao read the commendation order from the Central Military Commission. Comrades Zhang Chunqiao, Yu Lijin, and others presented certificates of merit, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges to the units and personnel who performed meritorious deeds in the battle. The meeting also read congratulatory telegrams and letters from higher authorities, sister units, and local revolutionary mass organizations.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao spoke first in the midst of warm applause. He reported to everyone the most exhilarating news: Our great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health and full of energy. This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and all the people of the world! Immediately, the venue erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life, eternal life!" echoed throughout the venue.

He said: Chairman Mao was very pleased to hear the report of your downing of an American-made U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft from the Kuomintang bandits. This is the greatest commendation and encouragement for you.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao pointed out: The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unprecedentedly good, and the situation of industrial and agricultural production is also very good. However, all reactionaries at home and abroad are not willing to accept their defeat and are stirring up trouble, attempting to sabotage and disrupt. He encouraged everyone to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy."

Comrade Yu Lijin then spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Air Force Party Committee, Air Force leadership, and all officers and soldiers of the Air Force, extended the warmest congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the participating units!

Comrade Yu Lijin said, Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "All our achievements and victories are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought." This battle's victory was achieved under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. This victory is the result of the officers and soldiers of the participating units resolutely following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promoting proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, carrying forward the spirit of the May 4th Movement, "holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement."

Comrade Yu Lijin emphasized that the enemies of the Chinese people—the U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries—are extremely afraid and hate the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant victories achieved by our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, the U.S. imperialists, in close collusion with the Soviet revisionist traitors, have been intensifying their aggressive deployments in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia, to form a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" against China, against communism, and against the people. The Indian reactionaries, under the instigation and incitement of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, are brazenly conducting military provocations against our country. The Kuomintang bandits are also stirring up trouble and attempting to sabotage and disrupt. Therefore, we must closely watch the enemy's movements, heighten our vigilance, and do a good job of preparedness to be ready at any time to smash the enemy's sudden attacks.

Comrade Yu Lijin strongly condemned and sternly warned the U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, reactionaries of various countries, and the Kuomintang bandits that if you dare to invade, we will annihilate you completely, thoroughly, and entirely, just as we did to the U-2 spy plane.

Comrade Yu Lijin finally encouraged all officers and soldiers of the participating units to remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to retrogression" while celebrating the victory, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, to seriously summarize the experience of the battle, to strive for new achievements, and to make new contributions to defending Chairman Mao, defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defending our socialist iron fortress.

Leaders from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Nanjing Military Region, Shanghai Garrison, East China Fleet, and representatives of local revolutionary mass organizations spoke at the meeting, extending warm congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the participating units.

Representative Shao Gang of the participating units said at the meeting: We will definitely implement Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, to launch a broader, deeper, and more solid campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to truly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds; to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, to carry out in-depth education on the two-line struggle; to heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, firmly guard our battle positions, and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade; to achieve new victories in defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Finally, the meeting ended with the song "The Boat Sails on the Sea Under the Guidance of the Helmsman" and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

    新华社二十八日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天下午在华东某地隆重举行祝捷庆功大会，欢庆空军某部九月八日一举击落美制蒋匪帮U—2型高空侦察机的重大胜利，表彰参战有功单位和人员。参加大会的指战员和无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼：这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是参战部队指战员坚决响应毛主席抓革命，促战备的伟大号召所取得的光辉成果！他们坚决表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决地贯彻执行最高统帅毛主席“抓革命，促战备，促工作，促生产”的伟大指示，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫国防中，为人民再立新功。
    祝捷庆功大会洋溢着胜利的欢乐气氛。会场正中挂着我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的巨幅画像。会场两侧悬挂着毛主席语录。毛主席语录歌声和“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声此起彼伏，响彻全场。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。
    中央文化革命小组副组长、南京部队负责人张春桥同志，中国人民解放军空军负责人余立金同志出席了大会。
    参加大会的还有南京部队、南京部队空军、上海警备区、东海舰队和上海市革命委员会的负责人以及部队指战员和当地各革命群众组织的代表一千多人。
    会上，张春桥同志宣读了中共中央军委嘉奖令。张春桥、余立金等同志将立功奖状、《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章授给作战有功单位和人员。会上还宣读了上级领导机关和兄弟部队以及当地革命群众组织的贺电、贺信。
    张春桥同志在热烈的掌声中首先讲话。他向大家报告了最最振奋人心的喜讯：我们伟大的领袖毛主席身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，这是全中国人民和全世界人民的最大幸福！顿时，全场响起了经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”的欢呼声响彻全场。
    他说：毛主席听了你们打下美制蒋匪帮U—2型高空侦察机的汇报，很高兴。这是对你们最大的嘉奖和鼓舞。
    张春桥同志指出：当前全国无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，工农业生产形势也非常好。但是，国内外一切反动派决不甘心他们的失败，他们正在蠢蠢欲动，妄图进行破坏和捣乱。他勉励大家坚决响应毛主席抓革命，促战备的伟大号召，提高警惕，加强战备，“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌。”
    接着余立金同志在大会上讲话。他代表空军党委、空军领导机关和空军全体指战员，向参战部队的全体指战员致以最热烈的祝贺！
    余立金同志说，林副主席指出：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”这次战斗的胜利，是在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下取得的。这次胜利，是参战部队指战员坚决按照林副主席的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的结果。
    余立金同志强调指出，中国人民的死敌——美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对我国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利，怕得要命，恨得要死。最近美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团紧密配合下，竭力加紧在亚洲，特别是在东南亚的侵略部署，拼凑反华、反共、反人民的反革命“神圣同盟”。印度反动派在美帝、苏修的指使和策动下，明目张胆地对我国进行猖狂的军事挑衅。蒋匪帮也在蠢蠢欲动，伺机捣乱和破坏。因此，我们必须密切注视敌人的动向，百倍提高警惕，把战备工作做得好上加好，随时准备粉碎敌人的突然袭击。
    余立金同志强烈谴责并严正警告美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者和各国反动派以及蒋介石匪帮，如果你们胆敢来侵犯，我们一定会象歼灭U—2飞贼一样，把你们彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉。
    余立金同志最后勉励参战部队全体指战员，在庆祝胜利的时候，一定要牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为指针，认真总结作战的经验，再接再厉，为保卫毛主席、保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫我国社会主义铁打江山作出新贡献。
    上海市革命委员会、南京部队、上海警备区、东海舰队的负责人，以及当地革命群众组织代表，先后在会上讲话，向参战部队全体指战员表示热烈祝贺。
    参战部队代表邵刚在会上表示：我们一定坚决贯彻林副主席关于把学习毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段的指示，更广泛、更深入、更扎实地掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，真正做到学出新水平，用出新水平，取得新成效，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威；紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，深入开展革命的大批判，深入开展两条路线教育；提高警惕，加强战备，严守战斗岗位，随时准备坚决、彻底、干净、全部歼灭一切敢于来犯的敌人；为保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
    最后，大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声和“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声中结束。（附图片）
