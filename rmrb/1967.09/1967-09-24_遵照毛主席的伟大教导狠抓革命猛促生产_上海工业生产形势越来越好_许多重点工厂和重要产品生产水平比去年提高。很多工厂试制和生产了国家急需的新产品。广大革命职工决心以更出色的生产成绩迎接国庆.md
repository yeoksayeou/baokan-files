Following Chairman Mao's great instructions, the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts are grasping the revolution and promoting production with high revolutionary fighting spirit. The industrial production situation is getting better and better. Under the current situation of a new upsurge in revolutionary great alliances during the great criticism of the revolution, the Shanghai working class is determined to welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China with even more outstanding production achievements.

The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in the January Revolution storm, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." They bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. Many factory workers insist on eight hours of production and engage in revolution during their spare time. They debate different viewpoints after work, ensuring that production proceeds normally.

The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers on the industrial and transportation fronts are grasping the revolution and promoting production. Many key factories and important products have seen new improvements in production this year. The Shanghai Iron Alloy Factory, Shanghai Special Steel Pipe Factory, Shanghai Non-Ferrous Alloy Factory, Yangshupu Power Plant, Shanghai Sixth Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7, Shanghai Radio Factory No. 8, Shanghai Bicycle Factory No. 3, Shanghai Watch Factory, and Shanghai Ink Factory, among many others, have all seen varying degrees of growth in production levels compared to the same period last year. Product quality is stable and has improved, labor productivity has increased, and costs have been reduced. Many factories have trial-produced and produced new products urgently needed by the state, researched and improved many new processes and technologies, and promoted the development of production.

The increasingly widespread and in-depth revolutionary great criticism has powerfully promoted the development of Shanghai's industrial production. Many factories, based on workshops and teams, have launched a high tide of mass revolutionary great criticism. Through the revolutionary great criticism, revolutionary workers deeply detest China's Khrushchev and his revisionist line, and love Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more. In the revolutionary great criticism, they thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of managing enterprises, break through various outdated rules that constrain the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, and remove obstacles to the development of production. The Shanghai Ink Factory, which is responsible for producing the ink used for Chairman Mao's works and portraits, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious" and "without capitalists, the factory cannot be run" by the capitalist-roaders within the party. They smashed the old production processes concocted by past capitalists that were detached from reality and full of mystification, strengthened their connection with the using departments, and successfully researched new production processes that are fast, good, and economical. The output of ink has rapidly increased, and from January to August this year, they have already completed three-quarters of the annual plan, a 32% increase over the same period last year.

Correctly identifying cadres, daring to liberate and boldly using revolutionary cadres, is an important reason for the achievements in grasping the revolution and promoting production on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts. In more than a hundred factories in the Shanghai Instrument Industry System, over three hundred factory-level revolutionary cadres are working on the production front line, playing an active role in promoting production.

The good situation of grasping the revolution and promoting production on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts is inseparable from the strongest support of the PLA's army, navy, and air force stationed in Shanghai. The broad revolutionary cadres also have unlimited trust and reliance on the PLA, learning from their high revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, promoting revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary "three-in-one combinations," and continuously achieving new victories in production.

Under the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation, the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts firmly declare: To raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to further deepen the revolutionary great criticism, to further redouble our efforts, and to complete the production tasks in a good, fast, and economical way, and to make new contributions to the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    遵照毛主席的伟大教导狠抓革命猛促生产
　　上海工业生产形势越来越好
　　许多重点工厂和重要产品生产水平比去年提高。很多工厂试制和生产了国家急需的新产品。广大革命职工决心以更出色的生产成绩迎接国庆
    据新华社上海二十三日电　上海工业交通战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，以高昂的革命战斗意志，狠抓革命，猛促生产，工业生产形势越来越好。在当前革命大批判中出现革命大联合新高涨的大好形势下，上海工人阶级决心以更出色的生产成绩，迎接伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在“一月革命”风暴中，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权以后，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。许多工厂的革命职工坚持八小时生产，业余时间闹革命，彼此之间有不同的观点也放在下班以后进行辩论，保证生产正常进行。
    工业交通战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，许多重点工厂和重要产品，今年以来的生产都有了新的提高。上海铁合金厂、上海异型钢管厂、上海有色合金厂、杨树浦发电厂、上海第六机床厂、上海无线电七厂、上海无线电八厂、上海自行车三厂、上海手表厂、上海油墨厂等许多工厂，生产水平都比去年同期有不同程度的增长。产品质量稳定，并且有所提高，劳动生产率提高，成本下降。很多工厂都试制和生产了国家急需的新产品，研究改进和创造了不少新工艺、新技术，促进了生产的发展。
    越来越广泛、越来越深入的革命大批判，强有力地推动了上海工业生产的发展。许多工厂以车间和班组为基础，掀起了群众性的革命大批判的高潮。通过革命的大批判，革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的修正主义路线深恶痛绝，对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱。他们在革命大批判中，大破修正主义办企业的路线，冲破了种种束缚群众积极性、创造性的陈规陋章，为发展生产扫除了障碍。担负着毛主席著作、毛主席画像所用油墨生产的上海油墨厂，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”和本厂党内走资本主义道路当权派“没有资本家就不能办厂”等反动谬论，大灭资产阶级威风，大长无产阶级志气。工人们砸烂了过去资本家炮制的脱离实际、故弄玄虚的工艺路线，和使用部门加强联系，研究成功了多快好省的新的生产工艺，油墨的产量迅速上升，今年一至八月，已经完成全年计划的四分之三，比去年同期增长百分之三十二。
    正确识别干部，敢于解放和大胆使用革命干部，是上海工交战线抓革命、促生产取得成绩的一个重要原因。上海仪表工业系统的一百多个工厂中，已有三百多个厂级革命干部在生产第一线抓工作，在促进生产中起了积极作用。
    上海市工交战线抓革命、促生产的形势越来越好，是和人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军的最坚强有力的支持分不开的。广大无产阶级革命派也无限相信和依靠解放军，学习他们高度的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，使生产不断取得了新的胜利。
    在空前大好的革命形势下，上海工交战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工坚定地表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步深入开展革命的大批判，更加鼓足干劲，多快好省地完成生产任务，为无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利作出新的贡献。
