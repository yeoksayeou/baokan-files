In the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, the vast majority of units in the industrial and transportation systems of Guiyang have taken Guiyang Cotton Mill as an example and achieved revolutionary great unity by department.

The latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao have echoed like thunder in the city of Guiyang. Broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have swiftly launched a new high tide of revolutionary great unity in the midst of revolutionary criticism and repudiation. In recent days, revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses from various fronts such as industry, transportation, agriculture, forestry, education, commerce, finance, and public security in the Guiyang region have learned from the advanced experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill. Over ninety percent of them have achieved revolutionary great unity by system, by unit, and by administrative department.

The experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill, which was the first in the country to achieve revolutionary great unity by administrative department, has been seriously studied by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses from various fronts in the Guiyang region. Following the path of Guiyang Cotton Mill, many units have organized themselves from the bottom up into a unified revolutionary organization by department. Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Chairman Mao's great instruction has greatly inspired the broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses. With boundless loyalty and faith in Chairman Mao, they have studied this latest instruction time and again and immediately taken action.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses on the industrial, construction, and transportation fronts in Guizhou Province have taken the lead, closely following Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, taking Guiyang Cotton Mill as an example, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their guide. They have seriously carried out rectification, combining rectification with unity and struggle, overcoming factionalism, and eliminating small cliques. In the high tide of revolutionary criticism and repudiation, they have further achieved revolutionary great unity. By September 22, over ninety percent of the bureaus and factories in the provincial industrial, construction, and transportation systems had successfully achieved and developed revolutionary great unity. The revolutionary workers of Guiyang Coal Mine, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, acted swiftly and achieved revolutionary great unity in just a few days. The number of participants in the revolutionary great unity has reached over ninety percent of the total workforce. Revolutionary great unity has promoted revolutionary criticism and repudiation and also facilitated the development of production. The daily output of raw coal in the entire mine has risen to over six hundred tons, creating a record that has never been seen before.

The working class has taken the lead, and all fronts have surged forward. The twenty-four units under the provincial agricultural and forestry system have all achieved revolutionary great unity by department on September 23. The forty-five units under the provincial propaganda and education system have completely achieved revolutionary great unity on September 22; among them, the units that had already achieved revolutionary great unity have further consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of various primary and secondary schools in Guiyang region have held a rally to solemnly pledge to carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve revolutionary great unity. Currently, over ninety percent of the primary and secondary schools in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity, and teachers and students have returned to school to carry out the revolution.

In recent days, the city of Guiyang has been filled with songs of victory and good news, with red flags flying and drums beating. Revolutionary masses have been continuously reporting to the provincial revolutionary committee and the provincial military region the good news of achieving revolutionary great unity.

　　在毛泽东思想的原则基础上联合起来
    贵阳地区工交等系统的绝大多数单位，以贵阳棉纺厂为榜样，按部门实现了革命大联合
    新华社贵阳二十四日电　伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示象春雷一般响彻在贵阳山城，广大无产阶级革命派，在革命的大批判中，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速掀起了革命大联合的新高潮。最近几天来，贵阳地区工交、农林、文教、财贸、政法等各条战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，学习贵阳棉纺厂的先进经验，有百分之九十以上分系统、按单位、按行政部门实现了革命的大联合。
    全国最早按行政部门实行革命大联合的贵阳棉纺厂的经验发表以后，贵阳地区各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众认真地学习了这个经验，走贵阳棉纺厂的道路，有不少单位自下而上地按部门组织在一个统一的革命组织之中。我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的这一伟大指示，给了广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众以巨大鼓舞。他们怀着对毛主席无限忠诚、无限信仰的心情，一遍又一遍地学习这一最新指示，并且立即行动起来。
    贵州省工业、建筑、交通战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命群众一马当先，紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央，以贵阳棉纺厂为榜样，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指南，认真进行整风，边整风、边联合、边战斗，克服派性，铲除小山头，在革命的大批判的高潮中，进一步实现了革命大联合。到二十二日为止，省工业、建筑、交通系统已有百分之九十以上的厅局和厂矿企业胜利地实现和发展了革命大联合。贵阳煤矿的革命职工在毛主席的最新指示指引下，闻风而动，在短短的几天内就实现了革命的大联合。参加革命大联合的人数已达职工总数的百分之九十以上。革命的大联合推动了革命大批判，也促进了生产的发展，全矿原煤日产量上升到六百多吨，创造了过去所没有过的纪录。
    工人阶级一马当先，各条战线万马奔腾。省农林系统所属的二十四个单位，在二十三日全部实现了按部门的革命大联合。省宣教系统四十五个单位在二十二日完全实现了革命的大联合；其中原来已经实现了革命大联合的单位，在毛主席的最新指示的鼓舞下，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合。贵阳地区各大中学校的革命师生、红卫兵小将举行了坚决执行毛主席最新指示实现革命大联合的誓师大会，向毛主席保证，要在革命大联合中立新功。目前，全市大中学校有百分之九十实现了革命大联合，师生们纷纷返校复课闹革命。
    这几天来，山城贵阳凯歌阵阵，喜报频传，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，前往省革命委员会、省军区报告实现革命大联合的喜讯的革命群众络绎不绝。
