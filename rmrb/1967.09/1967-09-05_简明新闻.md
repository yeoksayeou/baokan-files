	Military and Civilians in North Vietnam's Quang Tri Province Shoot Down Three U.S. Aircraft

	The military and civilians of Quang Tri Province in North Vietnam shot down three invading American aggressor aircraft and damaged several others on September 3.

	Malayan Newspaper Denounces "Association of Southeast Asian Nations"

	The recent issue of the Malayan newspaper *People's Forum*, published in Singapore, carried an editorial stating that the recent formation of the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" by the U.S. imperialists, using their puppets Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, "Malaysia," and "Singapore," is a genuine American product. It is part of the U.S.-Soviet collusion to establish an anti-China encirclement in Asia and another tool for U.S. aggression in Southeast Asia.

	The editorial pointed out that the establishment of this new counter-revolutionary alliance only reveals the U.S. imperialists' more blatant aggression in Southeast Asia, which will inevitably arouse broader and more intense revolutionary struggles among the people.

	Italian Anti-Imperialist Front Calls for Strengthened Anti-U.S. Struggle

	The National Committee of the Italian Anti-Imperialist Front recently issued a statement calling on the Italian people to mobilize and participate in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, encircling the American aggressors on Italian soil.

	The National Committee of the Italian Anti-Imperialist Front emphasized in the statement that while strengthening the anti-imperialist struggle, it is necessary to wage an unyielding struggle against those Italian revisionist leaders who actively advocate "peaceful coexistence" with imperialist aggressors. It pointed out that these revisionist leaders have deceived and betrayed the people for more than twenty years since the war, colluding with American bandits and scheming in parliament, rather than calling on and mobilizing the proletarian masses to engage in revolutionary struggle.

	British Workers at U.S.-Owned Factory Stage Protest Demonstration

	Nearly four thousand workers at a U.S.-owned textile machinery factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Cheshire, Britain, staged a demonstration on September 1, protesting against the American capitalists' firing of workers and refusal to recognize workers' legal rights.

	The demonstrators angrily shouted, "Yankees go home!" "American scabs get out!" They marched around the factory, throwing bottles and stones at the factory windows. They also marched through the city streets.
