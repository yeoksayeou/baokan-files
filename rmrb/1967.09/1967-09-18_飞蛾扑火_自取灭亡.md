Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force units, on the afternoon of September 17, with lightning speed, shot down an invading U.S. high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance aircraft over Guangxi. The glorious annals of our heroic People's Liberation Army have added another brilliant page of achievements.

This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant result of the People's Liberation Army's emphasis on proletarian politics, the tradition of brave fighting, fearlessness of sacrifice, and fearlessness of fatigue, and the flexible and mobile strategy and tactics of continuous combat.

This victory once again proves that the great People's Liberation Army of China is the iron wall defending our socialist motherland and the Cultural Revolution.

At present, the revolutionary people of our country are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a great criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. In the great criticism, they are achieving great unity and the "three-in-one combination" in the revolution, doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, smashing all the sabotage and disruption by the class enemies, and strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The failure of China's Khrushchev has made the bosses on Wall Street's dream of restoring capitalism in China burst like a soap bubble. While they are in endless sorrow and lamentation, driven by the instinct of a dying class, they are more frantically carrying out sabotage, disruption, and war provocations against our country. They collude with the class enemies within our country, attempting to stop the great ship of our Cultural Revolution from sailing forward against the wind and waves.

"Even an ant cannot shake a tree." The great tide of our Cultural Revolution is irresistible by any force. Those domestic and foreign class enemies who dream of extinguishing the blazing fire of our Cultural Revolution are merely a few moths flying into the flame and will surely be burned to ashes.

The People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible.

The great people of China are invincible.

    飞蛾扑火　自取灭亡	本报评论员
    我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，于九月十七日中午，在广西上空，以迅雷不及掩耳的神速，击落入侵我国的美国无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。在英雄的人民解放军的光荣史册上，又载上了一页辉煌的战绩。
    这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是人民解放军突出无产阶级政治，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，连续作战的优良传统，运用灵活机动的战略战术的光辉成果。
    这个胜利又一次证明了，伟大的中国人民解放军是保卫我们社会主义祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的钢铁长城。
    当前，我国革命人民正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命的大批判，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，粉碎阶级敌人的一切捣乱破坏，加强和巩固无产阶级专政。
    兔死狐悲，物伤其类。中国的赫鲁晓夫的破产，使得华尔街的老板们在中国复辟资本主义的梦想，如肥皂泡般地破灭了。在他们无限悲伤和哀叹的同时，出于即将灭亡的阶级的本能，更加疯狂地对我国进行破坏、捣乱，进行战争挑衅。他们与我国国内的阶级敌人互相配合，妄图阻止我国无产阶级文化大革命的航船乘风破浪的前进。
    “蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”我国无产阶级文化大革命的巨流，是任何力量不可抗拒的。梦想扑灭我国无产阶级文化大革命熊熊烈火的国内外阶级敌人，只不过是几只投火的飞蛾，必将被烧成灰烬。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军是天下无敌的。
    伟大的中国人民是不可战胜的。
