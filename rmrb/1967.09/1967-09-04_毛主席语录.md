	We will not apply benevolent policies to the reactionaries and the reactionary classes for their reactionary actions. We will only apply benevolent policies within the people, and not to the reactionaries and the reactionary classes outside the people for their reactionary actions.

	*From "On People's Democratic Dictatorship"*

　　毛主席语录
    我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为。
