The Chinese Embassy in Burma has severely condemned the reactionary government in Burma for fabricating charges and persecuting innocent patriotic overseas Chinese.

New China News Agency, September 14th: Rangoon news: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, severely condemning the reactionary government in Burma for fabricating charges and persecuting innocent patriotic overseas Chinese.

The note said that in the face of the extensive exposure of its illegal arrests and brutal persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese, the reactionary government in Burma, in order to defend itself, finally, after illegally arresting patriotic overseas Chinese for nearly two months, shamelessly fabricated a charge of "disturbing the peace" for the arrested Chinese. In the note sent on August 24th and subsequent verbal discussions, it openly used this so-called charge to justify its arrests and persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese, attempting to shift the blame and confuse the issue.

The note said that patriotic overseas Chinese residing in Burma have always respected the customs and habits of the Burmese people and have made beneficial contributions to the Burmese people's efforts to maintain national independence and develop the national economy. Patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma are sincere friends of all ethnic groups in Burma. This is known to all Burmese friends who maintain traditional friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples and respect the facts, and it is also something that the Burmese government cannot deny. At the same time, patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma are part of the Chinese people. They love their great leader Chairman Mao, read Chairman Mao's books, wear Chairman Mao's badges, and participate in patriotic activities. These legitimate activities have won the approval and admiration of the Burmese people, adding new content to the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. The patriotic activities of overseas Chinese have never caused any "disturbance of the peace" for the friendly Burmese people. However, for the old gentlemen of the reactionary government in Burma, these legitimate patriotic activities have become a great crime of "disturbing the peace." The same patriotic activities of overseas Chinese have received such different reactions from the friendly Burmese people and the reactionary government in Burma. Is this not thought-provoking?

The note pointed out that the reactionary government in Burma keeps shouting that the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese "disturbed the peace," and through notes and newspapers, it has maliciously slandered patriotic overseas Chinese and the Chinese Embassy. This is merely a despicable attempt to shift the blame and evade responsibility for destroying Sino-Burmese relations.

The note said that since the reactionary government in Burma launched its anti-communist and anti-people civil war, the peace in Burma has been disturbed for the past twenty years. Recently, the peace in Burma, the peace in Rangoon, and even the peace of the Chinese Embassy in Burma have been seriously disturbed. The culprits who disturbed the peace are none other than the reactionary government in Burma. Isn't it you who planned and organized the fascist thugs to inhumanely kill hundreds of innocent patriotic overseas Chinese, and to burn, kill, loot, and arrest throughout Burma and Rangoon? Isn't it you who, in violation of international relations norms, organized fascist thugs to brutally attack the Chinese Embassy and kill the Chinese expert Liu Yi? We ask, if killing, arson, and plundering are not disturbances of the peace, then what is? You, the planners and organizers of these fascist atrocities, are not the culprits who disturbed the peace?

The Chinese Embassy, in the note, firmly rejected the reactionary government in Burma's unreasonable accusations against patriotic overseas Chinese and reiterated: The reactionary government in Burma must immediately stop persecuting the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese and release them all immediately.

    我驻缅使馆严正谴责缅甸反动派捏造罪名迫害爱国华侨
    缅甸反动政府必须立即停止对爱国华侨的迫害
    新华社十四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十二日照会缅甸外交部，严正谴责缅甸反动政府捏造罪名，迫害无辜爱国华侨。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府在它的非法逮捕和野蛮迫害爱国华侨的罪行被大量揭发的情况下，为了替自己进行辩护，终于在非法逮捕了爱国华侨近两个月之后，厚颜无耻地给被捕华侨捏造了一条“扰乱了和平”的罪名，在八月二十四日来照中和以后的多次口头谈话中，公然拿出了这条所谓罪名来为它逮捕和迫害爱国华侨进行辩解，企图转嫁罪责，蒙混过关。
    照会说，旅居缅甸的爱国华侨多年来一贯尊重缅甸人民的风俗习惯，对缅甸人民维护民族独立和发展民族经济的事业作出有益的贡献。旅缅爱国华侨是缅甸各族人民真诚的朋友。这是所有维护中缅两国人民间传统友谊和尊重事实的缅甸朋友所共知的，也是缅甸政府无法否认的。同时，旅缅爱国华侨又是中国人民的一部分。他们热爱自己伟大的领袖毛主席，读毛主席的书，佩戴毛主席的像章，参加爱国活动。这些正当活动博得了缅甸人民的赞许和钦佩，使中缅两国人民的传统友谊增加了新的内容。华侨的爱国活动，对于友好的缅甸人民，从来也没有发生“扰乱和平”的问题。但是，华侨的这些正当爱国活动对于缅甸反动政府的老爷们来说，却成了“扰乱和平”的大罪。同样是华侨的正当爱国活动，从友好的缅甸人民那里和从缅甸反动政府那里所得到的反应竟是如此迥然不同，这岂不是发人深省的吗？
    照会指出，缅甸反动政府口口声声叫嚷被捕爱国华侨“扰乱了和平”，并且通过照会、报纸，对爱国华侨和中国大使馆大肆诬蔑。这只不过是妄图嫁祸于人，逃避你们破坏中缅关系的罪责的卑鄙的伎俩而已。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府既然在“扰乱和平”几个字上大作文章，我们就有必要老实告诉你们，缅甸的和平自从你们发动反共反人民的内战时起，迄今二十年来，早已被你们扰乱。最近，缅甸的和平，仰光的和平，甚至中国驻缅甸大使馆的和平又遭到严重的扰乱。扰乱和平的罪魁祸首不是别人，正是你们缅甸反动政府。难道不正是你们一手策划和组织了法西斯暴徒，灭绝人性地杀害了数以百计的无辜爱国华侨，在全缅甸和仰光市大肆烧、杀、抢、捕吗？难道不正是你们破坏国际关系准则，组织法西斯暴徒野蛮地袭击中国大使馆、杀害中国援缅专家刘逸吗？我们要问，假如杀人、放火和掳掠不叫扰乱和平，那还有什么才叫扰乱和平呢？你们这些法西斯暴行的策划者和组织者不正是扰乱和平的罪魁祸首吗？
    中国大使馆在照会中坚决拒绝缅甸反动政府对爱国华侨的无理指责，并且重申：缅甸反动政府必须立即停止对被捕爱国华侨的迫害，并立即全部将他们释放。
