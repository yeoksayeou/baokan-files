In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, the revolutionary masses of Anhui Province's Hefei region and the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui, firmly implementing the important battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, jointly held a rally to support the army and love the people on September 12. The holding of this rally marks the beginning of a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui Province, a good start for the great unity of the two major revolutionary mass organizations in Hefei, and the proletarian revolutionaries in Hefei advancing from victory to victory along the strategic deployments of the great leader Chairman Mao.

On September 12, the entire city of Hefei was immersed in a joyous atmosphere. In the early morning, nearly 200,000 proletarian revolutionary fighters, revolutionary masses, and cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marched towards the rally venue from all directions. The venue was filled with the sound of slogans, drums, and firecrackers, resonating through the clouds, and brimming with the fervent atmosphere of military-civilian unity and revolutionary unity.

The responsible comrade of the PLA stationed in Anhui spoke on behalf of the Hefei garrison. He said, "The national situation is excellent, and Anhui is also in an excellent situation. The new conspiracy of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party led by Li Baohua and their henchmen has been thoroughly defeated. Today, the two revolutionary mass organizations can jointly hold this rally, which is the excellent situation. All class enemies are most afraid of this excellent situation, most afraid of the close unity between the military and the people, and most afraid of the unity of the proletarian revolutionaries." He expressed: "All cadres and fighters of the Hefei garrison will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and the trust of the revolutionary masses. They will be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and will definitely breathe together, share the same fate, weather the storms together, and share life and death with the proletarian revolutionaries, and strive forward bravely to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments."

The representatives of the proletarian revolutionaries in Hefei region unanimously expressed in their speeches at the rally: "We will firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, carry out the great criticism of the revolution, and make the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev stink to the core, stink worse than Trotsky of the past, and stink worse than Khrushchev of the present, so that they will be infamous forever. In the great criticism, we will consolidate and develop the great unity of the revolution, overcome the petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in Anhui Province as soon as possible. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people,' firmly rely on the PLA, and support the PLA. We will heighten our revolutionary vigilance, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the sabotage of class enemies, and prevent Khrushchev-style careerists from attacking the proletarian headquarters from the 'left,' the right, or both sides simultaneously."

The revolutionary masses attending the rally discussed the current excellent situation in Hefei and warmly applauded the successful step taken by the two revolutionary mass organizations towards great unity. During the preparation for this rally, the proletarian revolutionaries of the two revolutionary mass organizations, with the strong support and assistance of the PLA stationed in Anhui, exposed the bad elements who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to sabotage and instigate, removed the obstacles to the development of the great criticism and great unity of the revolution, and gradually eliminated the long-standing antagonistic sentiments between the revolutionary mass organizations, greatly promoting the development of the great criticism and great unity of the revolution.

The rally read a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The rally ended with the resounding song "The Ship of State Needs a Helmsman." After the rally, a grand parade was held. The PLA cadres and fighters led the way, and the two factions of revolutionary masses marched side by side. Along the parade route, the residents who poured out of the city, crowded on both sides of the streets, and even filled the windows and balconies of high-rise buildings, joined the parade in raising their arms and shouting, "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Many workers, peasants, students, cadres, and residents who came from afar to watch the spectacle of military-civilian unity praised this rally as a rally of unity, great unity, and a rally to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

The proletarian revolutionaries from Huainan, Wuhu, Anqing, Mengcheng, and other places sent congratulatory messages to the rally.

　　坚定地依靠解放军　坚决搞好革命大批判
　　合肥地区革命大联合形势大好
　　两大革命组织和解放军联合举行拥军爱民大会，决心紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署胜利前进
    据新华社合肥十九日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势鼓舞下，安徽省合肥地区两大革命群众组织和中国人民解放军驻皖部队、省军区广大指战员，坚决执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的重要战斗号令，十二日联合举行拥军爱民大会。这次大会的召开标志着安徽省无产阶级文化大革命进入一个崭新的阶段，标志着合肥地区两大派革命群众组织走向大联合的良好开端，标志着合肥地区无产阶级革命派正沿着伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署从胜利走向新胜利。
    十二日，整个合肥市一直浸沉在欢乐的气氛中。清晨，近二十万无产阶级革命派战士、革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，斗志昂扬，英姿飒爽，从四面八方涌向大会会场。会场内口号声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声交织一片，响彻云霄，洋溢着军民大团结、革命派大联合的热烈气氛。
    中国人民解放军驻皖部队负责人代表合肥驻军指战员在会上讲了话。他说，全国形势大好，安徽也是大好形势。安徽以李葆华为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其爪牙的新阴谋彻底破产。今天，两大革命群众组织，能够联合召开这个大会，这就是大好形势。一切阶级敌人最害怕这个大好形势，最害怕军民密切团结起来，最害怕无产阶级革命派联合起来。他表示：合肥驻军全体指战员决不辜负毛主席的期望和革命群众的信任。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，一定与无产阶级革命派同呼吸，共命运，风雨同舟，生死与共，为实现毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。
    合肥地区无产阶级革命派代表在大会上讲话中一致表示：决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，批得臭臭的，批得比当年的托洛茨基还臭，批得比现在的赫鲁晓夫还臭，要他们遗臭万年。要在大批判中，巩固和发展革命的大联合，克服革命队伍中的小资产阶级派性，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，早日实现安徽省无产阶级革命派的大联合。要坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，最坚定地依靠解放军，拥护解放军。提高革命警惕，巩固无产阶级专政，严防阶级敌人的破坏，严防赫鲁晓夫式的野心家从“左”的方面和右的方面或者同时从两个方面，向无产阶级司令部的进攻。
    到会革命群众畅谈了当前合肥地区的大好形势，热烈欢呼两大革命群众组织走向大联合已经迈出了成功的一步。在筹备这次大会中，两大革命群众组织的无产阶级革命派，在中国人民解放军驻皖部队的大力支持和协助下，识破了钻进革命队伍进行破坏和挑拨的坏人，扫除了开展革命大批判、实现革命大联合的绊脚石，革命群众组织之间长期存在的对立情绪开始逐步消除，大大推进了革命大批判和革命大联合的发展。
    大会宣读了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的宏亮的歌声中结束。会后举行了声势浩大的游行。人民解放军指战员为前导，两派革命群众肩并肩地前进。游行队伍经过的沿途，倾城而出的居民，簇拥在街道两旁，连高楼的窗口和阳台上都挤满了人，他们和游行的队伍一起振臂高呼：“向中国人民解放军学习！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”许多远道赶来观看军民团结盛况的工人、农民、学生、干部、居民，无不称赞这次大会是团结的大会，大联合的大会，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大会。
    淮南、芜湖、安庆、蒙城等地的无产阶级革命派都给大会送来了贺信。
