The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper on September 21 published an editorial titled "On Class Struggle and People's Unity" in response to Comrade Enver Hoxha's report at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front.

The editorial says that the struggle against the plots of imperialists, Greek fascist monarchists, and other enemies, as well as the struggle against modern revisionists and domestic enemies, has proven the indestructible unity of the Albanian people and the Democratic Front around the Labor Party. It has also taught us that this unity can only be tempered in the sharp class struggle within the country and internationally.

The editorial points out that the teachings of the Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania on class struggle and the conduct of class struggle as the motive force of socialist society have illuminated the path for us to recognize and interpret contemporary events, phenomena, and tasks. The twenty-five-year history of our party tells us that unity is continuously tempered in the struggle to correctly resolve people's internal contradictions and in the development of class struggle. Over the past twenty-five years, our party and the Democratic Front under its leadership have achieved great success in uniting the people, and the reason is that they have faithfully adhered to the Marxist-Leninist teachings on class and class struggle. To view the issue of unity without class struggle, to deny class struggle and non-antagonistic contradictions in socialist society under the guise of unity, would mean weakening the political and ideological vigilance of the party and the working people, and undermining unity itself and the socialist cause. This teaching of the party is of great significance to all stages of socialist construction, to party organizations and Democratic Front organizations, and to every worker.

The editorial says that currently, a great thought and cultural revolution is being successfully carried out in Albania, which is a prerequisite for advancing the great cause of socialist construction. A relentless struggle is being waged to eradicate backward customs, remnants of bourgeois ideology, religious idealist worldviews, and bourgeois feudal reactionary attitudes towards women from people's minds. The party and Comrade Enver Hoxha teach us that at no time should the party's ideological work be weakened, because the class enemy is actively operating on the ideological front. Their main target is people, to lead them astray, obstruct our progress, and sow discord between the people and the party, in order to prepare the ground for counter-revolutionary, imperialist intervention, and the restoration of capitalism. The editorial concludes by saying that in the current situation, when class struggle on the ideological front is being widely conducted within the country and internationally, understanding the party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings on unity, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and class struggle is the main task of party committees and organizations, and the basic direction of the ideological work of the Democratic Front.

The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper on September 20 published an editorial titled "The People's Republic of Albania is a Reliable Bulwark for Defending Socialism and Revolution" in response to Comrade Enver Hoxha's report at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front.

The editorial says that in analyzing the international situation, Comrade Enver Hoxha's report particularly emphasizes the need to maintain vigilance and keep powder dry to counter the hostile and aggressive activities of imperialists and their accomplices, the Khrushchev revisionists. The editorial points out that one of the main features of the current international situation is that the U.S.-Soviet "holy alliance" aimed at dividing spheres of influence and dominating the world is developing in the political, economic, ideological, military, and cultural spheres, especially in Europe.

The editorial points out that "due to the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionist leadership clique seizing power, the fruits of the October Socialist Revolution are in serious crisis in the great country of Lenin and Stalin, the homeland of revolution. The Khrushchev traitor clique has led the glorious Soviet state down the path of restoring capitalism, turning the Soviet Union from a bastion of revolution and the struggle for freedom and liberation of all peoples into an imperialist state that stifles the flames of revolutionary struggle."

The editorial emphasizes that the great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, socialist construction, and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat have made imperialists and revisionists tremble with fear and anxiety, because these victories have struck and eliminated class enemies, imperialist and bourgeois agents, and open and covert revisionists. It is precisely to obstruct and sabotage the historic victory of the 700 million Chinese people that the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of countries like India have colluded to build an "anti-China wall," encircle and eliminate the great People's Republic of China. However, the Chinese giant, armed with the Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao Zedong and directly led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is turning the cunning and evil plots of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries into bubbles, transforming their great and powerful motherland into an indestructible bastion of socialism and revolution, and becoming a shining example that inspires all revolutionary peoples of Asia and the world.

In discussing Albania's foreign policy, the editorial says that Albania is a peace-loving country and an important factor in maintaining peace in the Balkans and the Adriatic region.

The editorial concludes by saying that socialist Albania is not isolated. The 700 million Chinese people stand with her, and all revolutionary peoples of the world stand with her. Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the People's Republic of Albania has become an indestructible bastion and a star and banner of socialism and revolution in the rear of the imperialist and revisionist lines in Europe.

    阿《人民之声报》强调开展阶级斗争是社会主义社会的动力
　　阿尔巴尼亚是不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒
　　中国文化大革命的伟大胜利使帝修胆颤心惊惶惶不安
    据新华社地拉那二十二日电　《人民之声报》二十一日就霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线四大的报告发表题为《论述阶级斗争和人民团结》的社论。
    社论说，反对帝国主义者和希腊法西斯保皇分子以及其它敌人的阴谋的斗争，反对现代修正主义者和反对国内敌人的斗争，证明了阿尔巴尼亚人民和民主阵线在劳动党周围的牢不可破的团结的生命力；同时也教育了我们，只有在国内和国际范围内尖锐的阶级斗争中才能锤炼这种团结。
    社论指出，劳动党和霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上关于阶级斗争、开展阶级斗争作为社会主义社会动力的教导，给我们照亮了认识和解释当代各种事件、现象和任务的道路。劳动党二十五年来的历史经验告诉我们，团结是在正确解决人民内部矛盾的斗争和努力中，在阶级斗争的发展过程中持续不断地得到锤炼的。二十五年来，我们党和在党领导之下的民主阵线在团结人民方面取得了巨大的成就，其原因就是忠实地对待马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导。离开阶级斗争来看待团结问题，以所谓团结来否认阶级斗争和社会主义社会里的非对抗性矛盾，这就意味着削弱党和劳动人民的政治和思想警惕性，破坏团结本身和社会主义事业。党的这一教导对于社会主义建设的所有阶段，对于党组织和民主阵线组织，对于每个劳动者都具有重大意义。
    社论说，目前在阿尔巴尼亚正在胜利地开展思想和文化革命，这是把社会主义建设的伟大事业推向前进的先决条件。一场为了根除人的意识中的落后习俗、资产阶级思想残余、宗教的唯心主义世界观和对妇女的资产阶级的封建反动的态度的不停斗争正在开展。党和霍查同志教导我们，任何时候都不应削弱党的思想工作，因为在思想战线上阶级敌人在积极活动。他们的主要目标是人，是使人误入歧途，阻挡我们前进，挑拨人民和党的团结，以便为反革命、帝国主义的干涉和复辟资本主义准备场所。社论最后说，在当前形势下，当国内国际范围内思想战线上的阶级斗争正在广泛开展的时候，理解党和霍查同志关于团结、加强工农联盟以及阶级斗争的教导，是党委和党组织的主要任务，是民主阵线思想工作的基本方向。
    据新华社地拉那二十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十日就霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上的报告发表了题为《阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是保卫社会主义和革命的可靠屏障》的社论。
    社论说，霍查同志的报告在分析国际形势时，特别强调要保持警惕、保持干燥的火药，以对付帝国主义者及其帮凶赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的敌对侵略活动。社论指出，当前国际形势的主要特点之一是，旨在瓜分势力范围和主宰世界的苏美“神圣同盟”，正在政治、经济、思想、军事和文化方面发展着，在欧洲尤其如此。
    社论指出，“由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒领导集团篡夺了政权，在列宁、斯大林的伟大祖国，十月社会主义革命的胜利果实处于严重的危机之中。赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团把光荣的苏维埃国家拉向了复辟资本主义的道路，把苏联从一个革命和各国人民争取自由解放的堡垒变成了窒息革命斗争烈火的帝国主义国家。”
    社论强调指出，兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命、社会主义建设、巩固无产阶级专政等方面取得的伟大胜利，使帝国主义、修正主义者胆颤心惊，惶惶不安，因为这些胜利打击和消灭了阶级敌人、帝国主义和资产阶级的代理人、公开和隐蔽的修正主义分子。正是为了阻止和破坏七亿中国人民的这一历史性胜利，美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和印度等国反动派互相勾结，企图建立“反华墙”，包围和消灭伟大的人民中国。但是，用毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义思想武装起来并在毛泽东主席直接领导下的中国巨人，正把美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和所有反动派的狡猾的罪恶阴谋化为泡影，把自己伟大而强盛的祖国变为社会主义和革命的不可摧毁的堡垒，变成鼓舞亚洲和世界所有革命人民的光辉榜样。
    社论在谈到阿尔巴尼亚的对外政策时说，阿尔巴尼亚是一个爱好和平的国家，是保持巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区和平的重要因素。
    社论最后说，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚绝不是孤立的。七亿中国人民同她站在一起，全世界革命人民同她站在一起。在劳动党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，已经成为不可摧毁的堡垒，成为欧洲、帝国主义和修正主义阵线后方的社会主义和革命的明星与旗手。
