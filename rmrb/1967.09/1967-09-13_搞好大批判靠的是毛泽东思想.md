Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and brilliant victories nationwide, and the situation is excellent.

Currently, a nationwide revolutionary criticism campaign against China's Khrushchev is underway, marking the time to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois headquarters politically, ideologically, and theoretically! In this new stage, our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has issued a new battle call to the entire army and the people of the nation: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Revolutionary criticism is a major battle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. This battle is crucial to determining whether the Cultural Revolution can achieve a thorough victory. We must keep up with this great struggle.

To achieve new merits, we must first achieve new merits in this revolutionary criticism!

Revolutionary criticism is a tough battle. We must fight our way through in this tough battle! We must use enough ammunition to hit the vital points of the bourgeois headquarters.

The poison and influence spread by the bourgeois headquarters are very deep. Every time we criticize and expose their every revisionist reactionary view, we are uprooting their every cancer of capitalist restoration in China. Dust will not disappear on its own if it is not swept away. Only through mass revolutionary criticism can we completely eliminate the reactionary poison of revisionism.

To achieve new merits, we must further strengthen the building of the revolutionary ranks. Without a highly combat-ready and proletarianized force, it is impossible to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is a very important issue pointed out to the revolutionary masses nationwide. We must, while transforming the objective world, make earnest efforts to transform the subjective world. If we do not guide petty-bourgeois ideology onto the track of proletarian revolution, we will not be able to grasp the correct political direction of the struggle, and we will not be able to keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in our thoughts and actions.

To conduct a thorough revolutionary criticism and strengthen the building of our ranks, what do we rely on? We rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought. We should, in this decisive battle, learn to use and master Mao Zedong Thought through criticism.

    搞好大批判靠的是毛泽东思想
    一年多来，无产阶级文化大革命在全国取得了伟大的、辉煌的胜利，形势一片大好。
    当前，全国掀起了对中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的时候到来了！在这个新的阶段，我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，向全军和全国人民发出了新的战斗号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”
    革命的大批判，是彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的大战役。这场战役是决定文化大革命是否能够取得彻底胜利的关键。我们一定要紧紧跟上这一伟大的斗争形势。
    立新功，首先要在这场革命大批判中立新功！
    革命的大批判是一场硬仗，我们要在这场硬仗中杀出威风来！我们要用足够的枪弹狠狠击中资产阶级司令部的要害。
    资产阶级司令部散布的毒素和影响是十分深的。我们批倒批臭他们的每一个修正主义的反动观点，就是从根本上挖掉他们在中国搞资本主义复辟的每一个毒瘤。灰尘不扫，是不会自己跑掉的。只有通过群众性的革命大批判，才能把修正主义的反动毒素，消除干净。
    立新功，必须进一步加强革命队伍的建设。没有一支非常战斗化、非常无产阶级化的队伍，要在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功是不可能的。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”这是向全国革命派指出的一个极为重要的问题。我们必须在改造客观世界的同时，认真努力地改造主观世界。不把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，我们就会在政治上掌握不好斗争大方向，就会在思想上行动上跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    要搞好这场革命的大批判，要加强我们队伍的建设，靠的是什么呢？靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想。我们应当在这场决战中，通过大批判，学会运用和掌握毛泽东思想。
