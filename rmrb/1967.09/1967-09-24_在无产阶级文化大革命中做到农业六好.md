In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve six excellence in agriculture.

Comrades of the poor and lower-middle peasants, comrades of the revolutionary cadres in the countryside, as the autumn harvest season begins, you must further implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. On the great socialist road, mobilize all forces to achieve six excellence in agriculture. These six excellence are: good production, good harvest, good seed selection, good procurement, good distribution, and good storage.

Good production means strengthening the late autumn crop management and timely and well planting of winter wheat.

Good harvest means carefully harvesting and threshing the autumn crops, ensuring every grain is collected, and achieving high yield and high harvest.

Good seed selection means selecting sufficient and good seeds locally to meet the needs of next year's planting.

Good procurement means ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of the state procurement tasks.

Good distribution means implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," understand the big picture, be broad-minded, have public evaluation by the members, distribute according to labor, and appropriately take care of the poor households.

Good storage means properly storing the harvested grains and economic crops, avoiding damage, eating and using frugally, and opposing waste and extravagance.

Achieving six excellence in agriculture is an extremely important measure to ensure a comprehensive harvest this year and a greater leap in agriculture next year.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: We must grasp grain, grasp cotton, and grasp cloth. Grain, cotton, and cloth are related to the lives of 700 million people nationwide and are related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." All these aspects must be done well.

Revolutionary cadres at all levels in the countryside must dare to take on responsibilities, work boldly, and stand on the production front line; they must be good at consulting with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, adhere to the working method of "from the masses, to the masses." Revolutionary cadres in the countryside must achieve new merits in achieving six excellence in agriculture. Cadres who have made mistakes in the past should make up for their mistakes in achieving six excellence in agriculture. Poor and lower-middle peasants should actively support the correct leadership of revolutionary cadres and help them do their work well.

Achieving six excellence in agriculture is a serious class struggle. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are unwilling to accept their defeat and collude with the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society to constantly plot various tricks, attempting to sabotage the normal production order of socialism. The broad revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army supporting agricultural production must thoroughly expose and resolutely strike down the sabotage activities of the class enemies.

Ensuring six excellence in agriculture is also the glorious combat mission of the revolutionary masses of all trades and industries nationwide. All units and departments, especially the transportation and financial departments, should be full of revolutionary enthusiasm, overcome all difficulties, and do a good job in supporting agricultural production.

Let us respond to the combat call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, mobilize immediately, and strive for a comprehensive harvest in agriculture.

　　在无产阶级文化大革命中做到农业六好
    贫下中农同志们，农村革命干部同志们，当三秋大忙季节开始的时候，你们要进一步贯彻我们的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在社会主义的伟大道路上，动员一切力量，做到农业六好。这六好是：生产好，收割好，选种好，征购好，分配好，保存好。
    生产好，就是要加强晚秋作物后期管理，适时种足、种好小麦。
    收割好，就是对秋收要细收细打，颗粒归仓，丰产丰收。
    选种好，就是要就地选足选好良种，以利明年下种时的需要。
    征购好，就是要保证完成和超额完成国家征购任务。
    分配好，就是要贯彻毛主席“兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面的利益”的指示，顾大局，识大体，社员公评，按劳分配，同时，适当地照顾困难户。
    保存好，就是要把丰收的粮食和经济作物，妥善保存起来，避免损坏，俭吃俭用，反对挥霍浪费。
    做到农业六好，是夺取今年农业全面丰收，保证明年农业更大跃进的极其重要的措施。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧。粮、棉、布关系到全国七亿人民的生活，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”。这几方面都必须努力做好。
    农村各级革命干部，要敢于挑担子，大胆工作，站到生产第一线；要善于同广大的贫下中农商量，坚持从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法。农村革命干部要在做到农业六好中立新功。过去犯有错误的干部，应当在做到农业六好中，将功补过。贫下中农要积极支持革命干部的正确领导，帮助他们做好工作。
    做到农业六好，是一场严重的阶级斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不甘心他们的失败，和社会上的地富反坏右勾结起来，总是要施展种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏社会主义的正常生产秩序。对于阶级敌人这种破坏活动，广大革命群众和支援农业生产的人民解放军，必须给予彻底揭露，坚决打击。
    保证农业六好，也是全国各行各业无产阶级革命派的光荣的战斗任务。一切单位，一切部门，特别是交通运输部门和财贸部门的革命职工，应该鼓足革命干劲，克服一切困难，做好支援农业生产的工作。
    让我们响应毛主席、党中央的战斗号召，立即动员起来，为夺取农业的全面丰收而努力。
