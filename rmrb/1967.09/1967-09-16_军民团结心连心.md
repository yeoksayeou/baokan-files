The People's Liberation Army of heroic China and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, have launched a great new wave of the movement to support the army and love the people.

The film records the grand spectacle of the September 2nd rally in the capital, attended by 100,000 people to support the army and love the people, as well as the September 8th gala evening. It also captures the extensive support activities for the army and love for the people by the troops, factories, rural areas, and the Little Red Guards. Every heart-stirring scene is imbued with the deep affection of soldiers and civilians being as close as flesh and blood, and as inseparable as fish and water. It showcases the revolutionary spirit of soldiers and civilians fighting together to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, this is a documentary film.
