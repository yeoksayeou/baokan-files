The Chinese Red Cross Issues a Solemn Declaration

Severely Denounces Some Leaders of the International Red Cross for Serving the U.S. Imperialist Plot to Create "Two Chinas"

Announces Non-Attendance at the Hague Meeting of the Red Cross Society and Resignation from the Executive Committee

New China News Agency, September 3rd: The Chinese Red Cross issued a solemn declaration regarding the 29th Council and General Assembly of the Red Cross Society to be held in The Hague, Netherlands, on September 5th. The declaration severely condemns those leaders of the International Red Cross who have consistently followed the U.S. imperialists, serving their plot to create "Two Chinas" and their aggression against Vietnam. The declaration points out that these leaders will continue their evil deeds at this meeting. Therefore, the Chinese Red Cross announces that it will not attend the Hague meeting and will no longer serve as an executive committee member of the Red Cross Society.

The declaration, issued on August 24th, points out that the leaders of the International Red Cross, composed mainly of the Permanent Committee of the International Red Cross, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Red Cross Society, have consistently, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, created "Two Chinas" at the International Red Cross Conference and in some Red Cross publications, serving U.S. imperialism's policy of occupying Chinese territory and opposing the Chinese people. Since 1965, U.S. imperialism has, through some leaders of the International Red Cross, repeatedly proposed resolutions and statements on the Vietnam issue, using every means to serve the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and the U.S.-Soviet collusion to sacrifice Vietnam in their "peace talks" plot. They have also sneaked in representatives from the Saigon puppet Red Cross to international conferences. According to the agenda of this meeting, they will continue their evil deeds. Therefore, the Chinese Red Cross solemnly declares its decision not to attend the Hague meeting. For the same reasons, the Chinese Red Cross will no longer serve as an executive committee member.

The declaration states that some leaders of the International Red Cross, despite the repeated protests of the Chinese Red Cross, have, in accordance with the intentions of U.S. imperialism, sneaked in the Chiang Kai-shek clique members, whom the Chinese people despise, into the 20th International Red Cross Conference, staging a farce of creating "Two Chinas." The declaration reaffirms that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people, and the Chinese Red Cross is the sole national Red Cross organization recognized by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Only the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Red Cross have the right to participate in the International Red Cross Conference. If the U.S. imperialists and their followers dare to use the agenda of the Hague meeting to plot any scheme aimed at creating "Two Chinas" at future International Red Cross Conferences, they must bear all the consequences that arise from it.

The declaration lists facts to denounce that some leaders of the International Red Cross have already become tools of U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and accomplices in suppressing the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist Red Cross has also actively participated in the plot of the International Red Cross leaders, colluding with U.S. imperialism to betray the interests of the Vietnamese people. All these plots are aimed at betraying the great cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and they will never succeed. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will one day be hanged by the people of the whole world. The other accomplices of the United States will also meet the same fate." The Chinese Red Cross, together with the Chinese people, firmly supports the Vietnamese people's just war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and strongly condemns the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. We firmly support the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The U.S. aggressor troops and their puppet troops must immediately and completely withdraw from Vietnam. This is the only way to solve the Vietnam problem and restore peace in Southeast Asia, and it is also the common demand of all Red Cross organizations that uphold justice.

The Chinese Red Cross solemnly declares that in the absence of the Chinese Red Cross, all resolutions passed by the 29th Council and General Assembly will not bind us, and we will not assume any obligations.

　　我红十字会发表严正声明
　　痛斥国际红十字一些领导人为美帝制造“两个中国”阴谋效劳
    宣布不出席红十字协会的海牙会议并不再担任协会执行委员
    新华社三日讯　中国红十字会对将于九月五日在荷兰海牙举行的红十字会协会第二十九届理事会和代表会发表严正声明，严厉谴责一贯追随美帝国主义的国际红十字的一些领导人，一贯为美帝国主义敌视中国人民、制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务，为美帝国主义侵略越南效劳。声明指出，国际红十字的一些领导人在这次会议上，仍将继续进行同样的罪恶勾当。为此，中国红十字会宣布不出席这次海牙会议，并不再担任红十字会协会的执行委员。
    这份在八月二十四日发出的声明指出，以国际红十字常设委员会、红十字国际委员会和红十字会协会为主体组成的国际红十字的一些领导人，在美帝国主义操纵下，一贯在国际红十字大会上和一些红十字出版物中制造“两个中国”，为美帝国主义霸占中国领土、敌视中国人民的政策服务。一九六五年以来，美帝国主义还通过国际红十字一些领导人，一再提出关于越南问题的提案和声明，千方百计为美帝侵略越南和美苏勾结牺牲越南的“和谈”阴谋效劳，并且把西贡傀儡红十字会代表塞进国际会议。根据这次会议的议程，他们仍将继续进行同样的罪恶勾当。为此，中国红十字会严正声明，决定不出席海牙会议。鉴于上述同样理由，中国红十字会不再担任协会执行委员。
    声明说，国际红十字一些领导人不顾中国红十字会的多次抗议，秉承美帝国主义的意旨，把中国人民所唾弃的蒋帮分子塞进第二十届国际红十字大会，演出了制造“两个中国”的丑剧。声明重申：中华人民共和国政府是代表中国人民的唯一的合法政府，中国红十字会是经中华人民共和国政府承认的唯一的全国性红十字组织。只有中华人民共和国政府和中国红十字会才有权参加国际红十字大会。如果美帝国主义及其追随者胆敢利用海牙会议的议程，策划旨在未来的国际红十字大会上继续制造“两个中国”的任何阴谋，他们必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    声明列举事实谴责国际红十字一些领导人已经充当了美帝国主义侵略越南的工具和镇压越南人民正义斗争的帮凶。苏联修正主义红十字会，也积极参与国际红十字领导人的阴谋活动，勾结美帝国主义出卖越南人民的利益。所有这些阴谋都是为了出卖越南人民抗美救国的伟大事业，是决不能得逞的。正象中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所指出的：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”中国红十字会和中国人民一起，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义战争，愤怒谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行。我们坚决支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，美国侵略军及其帮凶军必须立即、全部从越南撤走。这是解决越南问题、恢复东南亚和平的唯一途径，也是所有主持正义的红十字会的共同要求。
    中国红十字会郑重声明：在中国红十字会缺席的情况下，对第二十九届理事会和代表会通过的一切决议，我们不受任何约束，也不承担任何义务。
