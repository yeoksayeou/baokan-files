Title: "Exploitation Freedom" is a Bid for Power by the Landlord Class

In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants were all bitter gourds on the same vine, with each family having its own bitter history and blood debts. In the old society, my family not only suffered exploitation from landlords and rich peasants but also from usury. Once, my family borrowed 200 catties of rice, but by the time we had to repay it, it had grown to 900 catties of wheat due to compounded interest. It was only after liberation that my family was able to pay off this debt to the "King of Hell." Why was this? The fundamental question of revolution is the question of political power. In the old society, we suffered countless hardships precisely because we lacked a proletarian dictatorship; in the new society, we enjoy countless blessings precisely because we have a proletarian dictatorship. After liberation, the landlords and rich peasants saw that we poor and lower-middle peasants had taken power, and they were so enraged that their teeth itched. They dreamed of a reversal of fortune. China's Khrushchev is their loyal son and grandson, and he also hates us poor and lower-middle peasants to the core. He shouts about "exploitation freedom," attempting to restore capitalism, snatch the reins from our hands, and hand them over to the landlords and rich peasants, so they can once again ride roughshod over us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a pipe dream.

At this critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we militiamen must remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and resolutely stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev.

　　“剥削自由”是为地主阶级争“权”
    过去，我们贫下中农都是一根藤上的苦瓜，家家都有辛酸史、血泪仇。我家在旧社会里不但受地主、富农的雇工剥削，还受高利贷的剥削。有一次我家借了两百斤米，以后却要我们还九百斤小麦，利上滚利，直到解放时我家才还清这笔阎王债。这是为什么呢？革命的根本问题是政权问题。在旧社会里，我们千苦万苦，就是苦在没有无产阶级的政权；在新社会里，千甜万甜，就是甜在有了无产阶级的政权。解放以后，地主、富农看见我们贫下中农掌了权，恨得牙根痒痒的。他们连做梦也想变天。中国赫鲁晓夫是他们的孝子贤孙，也对我们贫下中农恨得要命。他就叫嚷“剥削自由”，妄图复辟资本主义，把我们贫下中农手里的印把子夺过去，交给地主、富农，让他们重新骑在我们贫下中农头上。这是痴心妄想。
    在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的时刻，我们民兵要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
