The past is not to be mentioned again, old accounts are not to be settled, responsibility is not to be pursued, and we look forward together.

Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army comrades executing military training tasks, revolutionary teachers and students of Renmin University Affiliated Middle School earnestly study the works of Chairman Mao, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, clarify the distinction between friends and enemies, and conduct sincere self-criticism. This has helped the two factions end their "internal warfare" and jointly engage in the revolutionary criticism campaign.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 16th, the People's Liberation Army executing military training tasks at Renmin University Affiliated Middle School has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Following the line of struggle between the two lines and Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, they have helped the two opposing revolutionary factions clarify the distinction between friends and enemies, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and conduct strict self-criticism. This has promoted and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and driven the revolutionary criticism campaign.

Due to the evil influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and the non-proletarian thoughts existing among the revolutionary masses, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school have been basically divided into two major factions since the beginning of this year: one represented by "Jinggangshan" and the other by "Hongqi." The two factions had strong antagonistic sentiments and often engaged in "internal warfare," hindering the progress of the revolutionary criticism campaign and the revolutionary great alliance. It was at this time that the soldiers and officers executing military training tasks arrived at the school. After a period of thorough investigation, they concluded that both factions were revolutionary mass organizations and decided to wholeheartedly support both.

During the military training, the soldiers and officers used Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and first launched a large-scale campaign to educate the entire school on the two lines, severely criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. The broad masses of teachers and students recognized the essence of the struggle between the two lines, greatly enhanced their love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and deepened their hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line and the capitalist-roaders in power within the party. The antagonistic sentiments between the two factions eased. Some teachers and students who had strong antagonistic sentiments also changed their attitudes through the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. Teachers actively went to the classrooms, and students held welcoming meetings for the teachers. In a short period, 24 out of the 36 classes in the entire school achieved a great alliance based on the classes.

However, in early April, many revolutionary teachers and students in middle schools had different opinions on military training and the great alliance, which led to heated debates. This trend also affected Renmin University Affiliated Middle School, and the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions intensified again. The soldiers and officers patiently and meticulously did political and ideological work through studying the works of Chairman Mao, heart-to-heart talks, and other means, helping the two factions conduct open rectification. After the rectification study, the political awareness of the entire school's teachers and students greatly improved. They enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and, under the affectionate care of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, after several revolutionary organizations fully prepared and jointly deliberated, formally established the "three-in-one" revolutionary committee in mid-May. The classes also basically achieved revolutionary great alliance.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, "internal warfare" was no longer fought, but sectarianism, factionalism, and other petty-bourgeois trends still affected the unity of the two factions. At this time, our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was reissued. The soldiers and officers immediately organized the revolutionary teachers and students of the two factions to bring their problems and seriously study this brilliant work again, conducting another open rectification. The leaders of the two factions held a joint meeting, analyzed the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the school, and reviewed the lessons learned from the "internal warfare" over the past few months. Both sides realized that the fundamental reason for the lack of unity was that they had not studied Chairman Mao's works well, had not clearly distinguished between friends and enemies, and still had the "self" in their minds.

To better guide the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness and conduct self-criticism, the soldiers and officers first took the lead in exposing their own shortcomings and mistakes to the masses, accepting criticism from the masses, and broadly soliciting opinions from the masses. The actions of the comrades from the People's Liberation Army set a good example of breaking with selfishness and conducting self-criticism for the revolutionary teachers and students. Immediately, various revolutionary organizations also voluntarily and sincerely conducted self-criticism. Both sides expressed: the past is not to be mentioned again, old accounts are not to be settled, past responsibilities are not to be pursued, and we look forward together. Everyone said: we do not want to distinguish between this faction and that faction; if we must talk about factions, we are all revolutionary factions of the proletariat.

On the basis of the increasingly consolidated revolutionary great alliance, the military training team comrades and revolutionary teachers and students jointly engaged in the revolutionary criticism campaign. In just one month, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, wrote more than ten thousand big-character posters and set up more than seventy big-character poster columns for criticism inside and outside the school.

### 人大附中革命大联合日益巩固

    旧话不再提　旧账不再算　责任不再追　共同朝前看
    人大附中革命大联合日益巩固
    革命师生在执行军训任务的解放军同志的帮助下，认真学习毛主席著作，破私立公，分清敌我，认真地进行自我批评，促使两派结束了“内战”，双方一道积极投入了革命的大批判
    据新华社十六日讯　在中国人民大学附属中学执行军政训练任务的人民解放军，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以两条路线斗争为纲，按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，帮助对立的两派革命师生分清敌友，破私立公，严格进行自我批评，促使两派发展和巩固了革命大联合，推动了革命大批判。
    由于资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响和革命群众中存在的非无产阶级思想作怪，这个学校的革命师生从今年年初以来，就基本上分为以“井冈山”为代表和以“红旗”为代表的两大派。这两派对立情绪很大，常打“内战”，妨碍了革命大批判和革命大联合的进行。就在这个时候，执行军政训练任务的解放军指战员来到了这个学校。他们经过一个时期的深入调查，认为两派都是革命群众组织，决定全心全意支持两派。
    指战员们在帮助这个学校搞军训的过程中，以毛泽东思想为指针，首先大张旗鼓地在全校开展两条路线教育，狠批资产阶级反动路线。广大师生认清了两条路线斗争的实质，大大增强了对毛主席革命路线的热爱，加深了对资产阶级反动路线，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨。两派对立情绪缓和了。过去有些教师和学生对立情绪也很大，通过批判资产阶级反动路线，教师主动下班级，学生举行欢迎会欢迎教师下班级。在很短时期内，全校三十六个班有二十四个班实现了以班级为基础的大联合。
    但是，四月初，许多中学革命师生由于对军训、对大联合等有不同看法，引起了激烈的争论。这股思潮也影响了人大附中，两派对立情绪又大了。指战员耐心细致地通过学习毛主席著作、谈心等方式做政治思想工作，帮助两派开门整风。经过整风学习，全校师生觉悟大大提高。他们热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，在中央文革的亲切关怀下，经过几个革命组织充分酝酿，共同协商，五月中旬正式建立了“三结合”革命委员会。各个班级也基本实现了革命的大联合。
    革命委员会成立后，“内战”不打了，但宗派主义、山头主义等小资产阶级思潮仍然影响两派团结。正在这时，我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》重新发表了。指战员们立即组织两派革命师生带着问题重新认真学习这篇光辉著作，再次进行开门整风。两派的负责人召开了联席会议，分析了学校文化大革命的形势，回顾了几个月来打“内战”的教训。双方认识到团结不好的根本原因是没有学好毛主席著作，没有很好地分清敌友，思想上还存在着“私”字。
    为了更好地引导全校革命师生破私立公，进行自我批评，指战员们首先带头把自己的缺点和错误亮给群众，接受群众批评，广泛征求群众意见。解放军同志的行动，给革命师生作出了破私立公、自我批评的好样子。紧接着各革命组织也都自觉诚恳地进行了自我批评。双方表示：旧话不再提，旧账不再算，过去的责任不再追，而是朝前看。大家说：我们不要分这一派，那一派，要说派，我们都是无产阶级革命派。
    在革命大联合日益巩固的基础上，军训团同志和革命师生一道积极投入了革命的大批判。在短短的一个月中，全校革命师生以毛泽东思想为武器，写了上万张批判大字报，在学校内外办了七十多个大批判专栏。
