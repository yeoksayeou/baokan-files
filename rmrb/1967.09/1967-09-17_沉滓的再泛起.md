In 1931, Lu Xun, in his essay "The Resurgence of Dregs," pointed out that after Japan occupied the Northeast, amidst the "national crisis cries"—that is, the so-called "new literary world" that was spreading "peaceful" sentiments—it was as if a stick had stirred a stagnant pond, causing all kinds of old and new dregs to float to the surface, turning somersaults and revealing their existence.

The so-called "patriotic" performances by the Li Pai troupe, which were singing decadent tunes under the guise of patriotism, were one such example. Lu Xun mocked these "stimulants in the midst of 'national crisis cries,'" these "stars who performed miracles," saying that they were merely new advertisements for old goods, seeking to squeeze more profits out of the "national crisis cries" or "peaceful" sentiments.

Time flies swiftly. After the tumultuous years of driving away tigers and leopards across the vast plains and the battles of crossing the Yangtze River with a million heroic troops, those so-called "patriotic song and dance performances" of the Li Pai troupe have long since disappeared.

Unexpectedly, more than twenty years later, those old and new dregs have once again floated to the surface, bustling about, clad in colorful garments, emitting a foul stench.

The "patriotic song and dance performances" of yesteryears—such as "Little Painter"—were not also hung with the banner of "excellent traditions since the May Fourth Movement," and proudly performed on the stage of the 1956 National Music Week? The manager of the Mingyue Song and Dance Troupe, who performed "patriotic song and dance" in the 1930s, and the progenitor of yellow music, was not also adorned with the laurel of "pioneer of socialist realism music," and invited as a guest of honor to the National Music Week, strutting proudly onto the dais? Those yellow songs that once swayed in the "progressive films" of the 1930s and undulated in the dance halls of wine and green lamps, were not also once rampant on the radio and in publications of New China?

How could the dregs resurface? The matter must be traced back to the "peaceful" sentiments.

In early 1956, with the 20th Congress of the CPSU in full swing, the black winds and demonic mists of modern revisionism spread everywhere. At this time, China's Khrushchev was overjoyed and immediately donned his armor, rallying in response to Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. He chattered endlessly, shouting that the landlord class had "already been eliminated," that counter-revolutionaries had been "basically resolved," and that the "active elements" of the bourgeoisie also "supported and propagated communism." Left and right, he used the word "finished," making all classes and class struggles dissipate into thin air with this word. According to China's Khrushchev, what remained was only the "organization of social life," which could also be considered a kind of "peaceful" sentiment!

In such a climate, this China's Khrushchev treated those feudalistic and black goods from the 1930s as socialist art, and obsequiously praised the Li Pai song and dance "Little Painter" as the tradition of our new operas, as the "grandfather" and "father." Thus, Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9," which sings "all humanity as brothers," the opera "Madame Butterfly," which advocates surrendering to the invading American imperialists, and the "Chinese dance drama" "The Mermaid," which uses "nationalization" as a cover to peddle Western bourgeois goods, were all staged by them to "organize" the people's "social life." It was as if: in the ancient music of the hu qin, one could hear their shouting and cursing, and on the keyboard, one could see their surging murderous intent. In this way, under the command of China's Khrushchev, all kinds of dregs resurfaced.

China's Khrushchev stirred up the dregs in the "peaceful" sentiments with malicious intent. His evil purpose was nothing more than what Lu Xun pointed out, to "squeeze more profits into their own hands." That is, into the hands of the entire bourgeoisie that had been dispossessed. Their method was to make the people lose their vigilance under the smoke screen of "peaceful" sentiments, to be gradually influenced by the foul stench of the dregs, and thus unknowingly be peacefully transformed.

However, history is ruthless. The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeps away all the dregs of the old world. Those who attempt to block the forward march of history may be able to float to the surface and perform for a while, but their ultimate fate will be the same as the dregs they stirred up—they will sink, sink, and sink to the bottom of the vast ocean!

### 沉滓的再泛起

    沉滓的再泛起	换新天
    一九三一年，鲁迅在《沉滓的泛起》一文中指出：在日本占据东三省以后的“国难声中”——即当时所谓
  “新的文艺界”所渲染的“和平声中”，“恰如用棍子搅了一下停滞多年的池塘，各种古的沉滓，新的沉滓，就都翻着筋斗漂上来，在水面上转一个身，来趁势显示自己的存在了。”
    打着爱国幌子的所谓黎派歌舞，就是在这个“国难声中”唱着靡靡之音，粉墨登场的。鲁迅嘲笑这些“真的‘国难声中’的兴奋剂”，这些“立奏奇功的大明星”，
  “不过是出卖旧货的新广告，要趁‘国难声中’或‘和平声中’将利益更多的榨到自己的手里”罢了。
    光阴急转，时光飞驰。经过千里中原驱虎豹的峥嵘岁月，百万雄师过大江的战斗年代，当年那些黎派的所谓“爱国歌舞表演”，早已销声匿迹了。
    不料事隔二十多年之后，那些古的沉滓，新的沉滓，却又翻着筋斗漂了上来，熙熙攘攘，披着五颜六色的外衣，发出腐败龌龊的臭气。
    当年的“爱国歌舞表演”——《小小画家》之类，不是又挂上“五四以来优秀传统”的招牌，堂而皇之，登上了一九五六年全国音乐周的舞台了吗？当年表演
  “爱国歌舞”的明月歌舞班经理、黄色音乐鼻祖，不是又戴上“社会主义现实主义音乐的先行者”的桂冠，奉为全国音乐周的上宾，大摇大摆地上了主席团的宝座吗？那些曾经摇曳在三十年代“进步电影”中，荡漾在酒绿灯红的舞场里的“郎呀，妹呀”的黄色歌曲，不是也一时泛滥在新中国的广播、出版物上了吗？
    沉滓怎能再泛起？事情还得从“和平声中”说起。
    一九五六年初，随着苏共二十大的紧锣密鼓，现代修正主义的黑风妖雾四处弥漫。这时，中国的赫鲁晓夫喜形于色，立即披挂上阵，与苏联赫鲁晓夫遥相呼应。他喋喋不休地叫嚷：地主阶级“早已被消灭了”，反革命“解决得差不多了”，资产阶级的“积极分子”，也“赞成共产、宣传共产”了。左一个“了”，右一个“了”，什么阶级和阶级斗争，统统在这个“了”字里烟消云散了。依照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，剩下的只有“组织社会生活”了，这也算是一种“和平声中”罢！
    在这样的声中，这个中国赫鲁晓夫把那些封建主义、三十年代文艺黑货，统统当作社会主义艺术供奉起来，并肉麻地吹捧黎派歌舞《小小画家》是我们新歌剧的传统，是“祖父”和“父亲”。于是，高歌“一切人类成兄弟”的贝多芬《第九交响乐》，宣扬投靠美帝国主义侵略者的歌剧《蝴蝶夫人》，以“民族化”为包装，贩卖西方世界资产阶级货色的“中国舞剧”《鱼美人》，等等，统统被他们搬上舞台，用来“组织”人民的“社会生活”。正是：胡笳古乐中可以听到他们的叫嚣怒骂，琴曲键盘上可以看到他们的腾腾杀气。就这样，各种沉滓在中国赫鲁晓夫的总指挥下趁势泛起了。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在“和平声中”搅起那沉滓乱翻，是包藏祸心的。他的险恶目的，也无非是鲁迅所指出的，要“将利益更多的榨到自己的手里”。也就是他所代表的整个被剥夺了的资产阶级的手里。他的手段就是要让人民在“和平声中”的烟幕下失去警觉，在沉滓的“香风”臭气包围中潜移默化，从而不知不觉地被和平演变过去。
    但是，历史是无情的。无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，荡涤着旧世界的一切残渣余孽。那些企图阻挡历史潮流前进的人，或许能漂上来在水面上转一个身，趁势表演一番，但是他们最后的命运，必然和被他们搅起来的“沉滓”一样，只能是沉下去，沉下去，沉没在汪洋大海的最底层！
