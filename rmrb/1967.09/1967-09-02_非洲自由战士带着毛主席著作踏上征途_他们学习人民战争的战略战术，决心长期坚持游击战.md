	The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of the peoples of southern and central Africa in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and in their quest for national liberation. Increasingly, more African freedom fighters are diligently studying the works of Chairman Mao, seeking in them the ideological weapons for revolution and liberation, and finding solutions to the various problems they encounter on the road to national liberation.

	Recently, the reporter met with many African freedom fighters. Some came from the forests of eastern Congo (Kinshasa), others from the plains of Mozambique and Angola, and still others from the valleys of Zimbabwe. Some had just returned from the front lines, while others were preparing to head to the battlefield. They all unanimously praised the great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, which have given them immense encouragement and shown them the way forward. They said, "Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary leader," and "Mao Zedong Thought is the compass guiding us to victory."

	A freedom fighter from Mozambique recounted to the reporter a scene he witnessed in a base area where his comrades were setting out for the front. He said, the guerrilla fighters carried with them Chairman Mao's "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" and "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and some wore Chairman Mao badges on their chests. They shouted the slogan "Resolutely advance, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, and overcome all obstacles to win victory," and marched off to battle with high spirits.

	A leader of a Zimbabwean nationalist organization told the reporter that some young Zimbabwean freedom fighters had saved up their pocket money to buy dozens of copies of the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and at the risk of their lives, brought these books to their comrades and revolutionary masses who were fighting on the front lines.

	Another African friend told the reporter that some freedom fighters from Congo (Kinshasa) who were recuperating in a hospital kept Chairman Mao's works by their bedsides. Even while recuperating, they diligently read Chairman Mao's works, combining their own combat experiences, and discussed the strategies and tactics of people's war.

	An old freedom fighter from Mozambique recalled, "We once tried to achieve independence through peaceful petitions, but we were met with a massacre. Now, the people of Mozambique have realized that only by taking up arms and waging a protracted guerrilla war can we drive out the Portuguese colonialists."

	Another freedom fighter from southern Africa had previously been deceived by the Soviet revisionists' lies about achieving national liberation through peaceful negotiations. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized he had been fooled. Reflecting on this experience, he said, "As Chairman Mao taught us, the enemy will not disappear on its own, and the enemy will not voluntarily leave the historical stage. To achieve true national independence, we must wage armed struggle."

	African freedom fighters who are currently engaged in armed struggle highly value "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" and other discussions on revolutionary war, as well as Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War." Many of them, through their struggles, increasingly understand that "revolutionary war is the people's war; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war."

	Once, a guerrilla leader told his soldiers, "We must rely on the masses. Our relationship with the masses should be like that of fish and water. Fish cannot live without water, and guerrillas cannot win without the people." Following this, the soldiers held a discussion. Some suggested that to protect the interests of the people, the guerrillas should not take things from the common people without permission. Some soldiers also made self-criticisms, reflecting on their past mistakes in dealing with the masses.

	How to deal with enemies equipped with modern weapons? Increasingly, more African freedom fighters, after understanding the correct relationship between people and weapons, have found a clear answer. They said, "The best weapons in the hands of cowards are useless." "Do not be afraid of the enemy's planes and cannons. With a fearless spirit, we can find ways to destroy them." They understand the importance of Chairman Mao's statement: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." Under the enlightenment of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, some leaders of patriotic armed forces in Congo (Kinshasa) and other countries have paid attention to the political and ideological education of soldiers and conducted political and ideological work among the broad masses of their country.

　　非洲自由战士带着毛主席著作踏上征途
　　他们学习人民战争的战略战术，决心长期坚持游击战
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　本社记者报道：毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着非洲南部和中部人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取民族解放的道路。现在，越来越多的非洲自由战士在专心致志地研读毛主席著作，从中寻找干革命求解放的思想武器，以解决他们在民族解放的道路上所遇到的各种问题。
    记者最近会见过许多非洲自由战士，他们有的来自刚果（金）东部的森林，有的来自莫三鼻给和安哥拉的草原，有的来自津巴布韦的河谷。有的刚从前线归来，有的正准备走上战场。他们都异口同声地赞扬伟大的革命导师毛主席的光辉思想给予他们以巨大的鼓舞力量，给他们的斗争指明了道路和方向。他们说：“毛主席是伟大的革命导师”，“毛泽东思想是指引我们走向胜利的指南针”。
    一位莫三鼻给自由战士对记者讲述了他曾在一个根据地看到他的战友们出发上前线的情景。他说，游击队战士们随身带着毛主席的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等著作，有些人胸前还佩戴着毛主席像章，他们高呼“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的口号，斗志昂扬地踏上征途。
    一位津巴布韦非洲民族主义组织的负责人告诉记者：一些年青的津巴布韦非洲自由战士用节省下来的零用钱买了几十本红色宝书《毛主席语录》，并冒着生命的危险把这些《毛主席语录》带给正在战斗中的战友和革命群众。
    另一位非洲朋友告诉记者：一些在医院里治疗的来自刚果（金）的自由战士在他们的病床旁边放着毛主席著作。即使在养病中，他们仍然勤奋地结合自己实际战斗经验，阅读毛主席著作，讨论关于人民战争的战略和战术问题。
    一位莫三鼻给老自由战士追述说：我们曾经想通过和平请愿取得独立，但是，我们却遭到了大屠杀。现在，莫三鼻给人民已经认识到只有拿起武器，坚持长期的游击战争，才能赶走葡萄牙殖民主义者。
    另一位非洲南部的自由战士早先曾听信苏联修正主义者散布的所谓通过和平谈判可以实现民族解放的谎言，在他学习毛主席著作之后才发现受了苏修的骗。他回顾这段经历时说：“正如毛主席教导我们的那样，敌人是不会自行消灭的，敌人是不会自行退出历史舞台的。为了实现真正的民族独立，就必须进行武装斗争。”
    正在进行武装斗争的非洲自由战士非常珍视《毛泽东军事文选》和其他关于革命战争的论述，以及林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》。他们中许多人通过斗争实践，越来越认识到毛主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    有一次，一位游击队领导人对战士们说：“我们应当依靠人民群众。我们同群众的关系应当象鱼和水一样。鱼离开水不能活，我们游击队离开人民就不能打胜仗。”接着，战士们展开了一场讨论。有的战士建议，为了保护人民的利益，游击队不应当未经允许随意拿用老百姓的东西。有的战士还作了自我批评，检讨了过去对待人民群众的错误思想。
    怎样对付用现代化武器装备起来的敌人？越来越多的非洲自由战士在认识到人和武器之间的正确关系后，便得出明确的答案。他们说：“再好的武器放在胆小鬼手中也没有用。”“不用害怕敌人的飞机大炮。只要有大无畏的精神，就能找到摧毁它们的办法。”他们认识到毛主席下述论断的重要意义：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”在毛主席这一光辉思想的启发下，刚果（金）和其他一些国家爱国武装的一些领导人已经重视对战士的政治思想教育，并向本国广大群众进行政治思想工作。（附图片）
