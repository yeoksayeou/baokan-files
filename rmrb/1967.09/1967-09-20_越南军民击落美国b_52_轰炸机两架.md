Vietnamese military and civilians in the Yongling area shot down two invading U.S. B-52 bombers on the afternoon of the 17th.

The report said that at 5:03 p.m. on the 17th, a group of U.S. B-52 bombers intruded into the skies over the Yongling area and were shot down by the highly vigilant Vietnamese air defense forces.

At 5:34 p.m., another group of B-52 bandit planes recklessly intruded into the Yongling area for bombing, but were met with a fierce counterattack from the local military and civilians, resulting in one of the planes being hit and exploding.

This is the first time that the military and civilians in North Vietnam have shot down U.S. B-52 bombers.
