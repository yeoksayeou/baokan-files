The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an unprecedented great revolution in human history

	NEW DELHI, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese newspaper "Changzhou News" reported that under the brilliant guidance of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary leftists of Fukushima Prefecture in Japan issued a declaration on August 26, announcing the establishment of the Japanese Communist Party Fukushima Prefecture Committee (Leftist). They declared that they are determined to fight bravely and resolutely to smash the traitorous revisionist group of Komoto and achieve victory in the Japanese people's revolution.

	The declaration said: "We are now in a great era of world revolution where imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory. Marxists-Leninists all over the world are holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting closely and uniting all oppressed peoples and nations, strengthening and developing the international united front against U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, and striking at the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries in various countries."

	The declaration said: "At present, 700 million Chinese people are advancing with great enthusiasm, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from victory to victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong is an unprecedented great revolution in human history that advances socialist revolution and socialist construction towards communism. At present, the revolutionary people all over the world, who are fighting against the most vicious enemy of the people of the world -- U.S. imperialism, are fighting bravely under the inspiration of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	The declaration said: "The revolutionary struggles all over the world are surging forward like a storm, while the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are frantically suppressing the people and plotting aggressive wars. Class struggle is becoming increasingly sharp and intense all over the world. It is in this situation that the Komoto Seiki group, fearing revolution and fearing war, has betrayed the people, surrendered to the enemy, and degenerated into a shameful revisionist."

	The declaration pointed out: "The Komoto Seiki group has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, degenerated into revisionism, and taken the despicable and shameful road of being pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-Chinese." The declaration said: "Against the counter-revolutionary revisionist group in the Party Central Committee -- the Komoto group, true Marxists-Leninists must resolutely rebel and thoroughly smash the revisionists."

	The declaration said that the red flags of the leftists in Yamaguchi, Aichi, Saga, Fukuoka, Hyogo, Osaka, and other places are flying in the wind, and the struggle to smash the Komoto revisionist group is surging forward. The declaration expressed: "In order to smash the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Komoto revisionist group, we are willing to unite with these advanced comrades, unite with the revolutionary comrades who will come to fight in the future, unite with the revolutionary people of the whole country, and fight to the end for the great unity of the leftists in the whole country."

	The declaration finally shouted: Down with the revisionists Komoto Seiki and others!

	Inherit the revolutionary tradition of the Japanese Communist Party, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and build a genuine revolutionary party!

	Long live the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism!

	Long live the unity of the proletariat and oppressed nations all over the world!

    继承日本共产党的革命传统，高举马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的旗帜，建设真正的革命政党！
