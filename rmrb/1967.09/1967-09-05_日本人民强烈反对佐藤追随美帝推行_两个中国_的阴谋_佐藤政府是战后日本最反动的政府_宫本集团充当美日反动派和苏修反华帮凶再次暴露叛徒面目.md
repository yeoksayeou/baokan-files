Japanese people strongly oppose Sato's scheme to follow the US Empire in pursuing "Two Chinas"
Sato government is the most reactionary government since the war
The Miyamoto group acts as the henchmen of the US-Japan reactionaries and Soviet revisionists, once again exposing their traitorous faces

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Sato Eisaku, the Japanese Prime Minister who has always followed the US imperialist policy of hostility towards China, ignoring the strong opposition of the Japanese people, after plotting anti-China and anti-communist activities with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Park Chung-hee puppet regime under the auspices of the US leader in South Korea in June this year, has decided to go to Taiwan for conspiracy activities in early September. This deliberate act of hostility towards the Chinese people has aroused the great indignation of the broad Japanese people who eagerly hope for Sino-Japanese friendship.

	Since late August, revolutionary people in Kitakyushu, Yamaguchi, Saga, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, and Ishikawa in Japan have held protest meetings and demonstrations.

	In the struggle, the broad masses have shown their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In the procession in various places, many people held high Chairman Mao's portraits and banners with Chairman Mao's quotations, sang Chairman Mao's quotation songs and songs praising Chairman Mao, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

	This large-scale protest activity was organized mainly by revolutionary left-wing organizations in various parts of Japan, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), and businessmen who truly hope for Sino-Japanese friendship, and received strong support from the broad masses of the Japanese people.

	At the West Japan People's Protest Meeting held in Kitakyushu, representatives from all walks of life angrily condemned and strongly protested against the crimes of the Sato government, which is the most pro-American and reactionary cabinet since the war.

	Representative Nakano Reizo of the Fukoka Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, speaking on behalf of the Fukoka Prefectural Committee (Left) and the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party and other organizations, angrily pointed out that Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, during his visit to South Korea in June, had held talks with US Vice President Humphrey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Park Chung-hee puppet regime aimed at plotting a new war of aggression. Now he has decided to "visit" Taiwan and South Vietnam, blatantly dragging Japan into the track of US imperialist aggression. Nakano said that the Miyamoto group of the Japanese Communist Party, which is in line with Soviet modern revisionism, not only intensifies the destruction of the pro-China movement within Japan but also frantically acts as the henchmen of US imperialism and the Sato government, intensifying anti-China activities. Nakano said that true Japanese communists will fight together with the Japanese people against the US-Japan reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party.

	The Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, which acts as the henchmen of the US-Japan reactionaries and Soviet revisionists, not only makes no condemnation of Sato's blatant criminal behavior of visiting Taiwan but, on the contrary, through its mouthpiece "Akahata," maliciously slanders and attacks the friendly trade sector and the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) that received strong support from the broad masses of the Japanese people, which once again exposes their revisionist traitorous faces.

　　日本人民强烈反对佐藤追随美帝推行“两个中国”的阴谋
　　佐藤政府是战后日本最反动的政府
　　宫本集团充当美日反动派和苏修反华帮凶再次暴露叛徒面目
    据新华社东京电　一贯追随美帝国主义敌视中国政策的日本政府首相佐藤荣作，不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，继今年六月到南朝鲜在美帝头目主持下与蒋匪帮、朴正熙傀儡集团策划反华反共的勾当之后，又决定在九月上旬去台湾进行阴谋活动。这一蓄意以中国人民为敌的行径，激起了热切期望日中友好的广大日本人民的无比愤怒。
    从八月下旬起，日本北九州、山口、佐贺、大阪、京都、神户、名古屋、石川等地的革命人民，纷纷举行抗议集会和游行示威。
    在斗争中表现了广大群众对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。各地的游行队伍中，有许多人高举着毛主席像和写有毛主席语录的标语牌，高声歌唱毛主席的语录歌和歌颂毛主席的歌曲，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    这次大规模的抗议活动是日本各地革命左派组织、日中友好协会（正统）总部和真正期望日中友好的贸易界人士等为主体组织的，得到了广大日本群众的热烈支持。
    在北九州市举行的西日本人民抗议集会上，各界代表愤怒谴责和强烈抗议战后历届内阁中最亲美最反动的佐藤政府的罪行。
      日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）代表中野礼造在代表日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）和山口县委员会（左派）等组织讲话时愤怒指出，日本首相佐藤荣作，在今年六月访问南朝鲜时，曾与美帝副总统汉弗莱、蒋匪帮和朴正熙傀儡集团举行了旨在策划新的侵略战争的“会谈”，现在又决定“访问”台湾和南越，明目张胆地把日本拖入美帝侵略战争的轨道上去。中野说，与苏联现代修正主义一脉相通的日共宫本集团不仅加紧破坏日本国内的日中友好运动，而且拚命地充当美帝国主义和佐藤政府的帮凶，加紧反华活动。中野表示，日本真正的共产党人，要和日本人民一起同美日反动派、苏联现代修正主义和日共宫本修正主义集团进行坚决斗争。
    充当美日反动派和苏修反华帮凶的日共宫本修正主义集团不仅对佐藤访台的露骨的罪恶行为，不加任何谴责，相反竟通过它的喉舌《赤旗报》大肆诽谤、攻击受到日本广大人民支持的友好贸易界和日中友协（正统）总部等二十九日在东京发起的空前规模的抗议行动，这再一次暴露了他们的修正主义叛徒面目。
