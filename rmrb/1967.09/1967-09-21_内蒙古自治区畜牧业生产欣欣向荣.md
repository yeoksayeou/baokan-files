The broad masses of herdsmen and revolutionary cadres in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have consistently followed Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, intensified class struggle, and worked hard to achieve a bumper harvest in livestock production. Statistics show that from July of last year to June of this year, the 1967 fiscal year, the entire region raised a total of over 11 million head of large and small livestock, an increase of nearly 2.6 million head compared to the previous year. The total number of livestock increased by over 1.57 million head on the basis of last year, exceeding the state plan.

The region's draft animals have reached an all-time high, with strong draft horses and mules increasing by 8% and 15% respectively compared to the previous year. Famous breeds such as the Sanhe horse, Sanhe cattle, and fine-wool sheep, as well as improved breeds, have increased by over 23% compared to the previous year. Livestock feed production and water conservancy projects in pastoral areas have also significantly surpassed previous years. The broad masses of herdsmen, with unprecedented high revolutionary enthusiasm and practical actions, have supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This year, they have provided the state with over 3 million head of draft animals, meat animals, and a large quantity of wool and furs.

　  内蒙古自治区畜牧业生产欣欣向荣
    内蒙古自治区广大牧民和革命干部，一直遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，大学毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争，艰苦奋战，夺得了畜牧业的丰收。据统计，从去年七月到今年六月的一九六七年度，全区接育大小牲畜达一千一百多万头，比上年增产将近二百六十万头。牲畜总头数在去年的基础上净增一百五十七万多头，超额完成了国家计划。
    自治区耕畜发展到历史上的最高水平，挽力强的耕马、耕骡，分别比上年增产百分之八和百分之十五。著名的三河马、三河牛和细毛羊等良种和改良种牲畜，比上年增产百分之二十三以上。牧区饲料生产、水利建设等，也大大超过了往年。广大牧民以空前高昂的革命热情和实际行动支持无产阶级文化大革命，这一年向国家提供了三百多万头耕畜、肉畜和大量绒毛皮张。
