Our Embassy Strongly Protests the Sri Lankan Government's Serious Political Provocation
The Sri Lankan Government's Anti-China Stance is Due to Fear of the Great Mao Zedong Thought
We Warn the Sri Lankan Government Again: Playing the Role of an Imperialist, Revisionist, Anti-China Jester Will Have No Good Ending

	NEW DELHI, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka sent a note to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on Sept. 1, lodging the strongest protest against the Sri Lankan government's unreasonable detention and refusal to return the badges of our great, great leader Chairman Mao to the Chinese Embassy. The note warned the Sri Lankan government again that it must stop all provocative actions against the Chinese Embassy and immediately return the badges of Chairman Mao to the Chinese Embassy.

	The note said: "The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka brought in 300 badges of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, from the mainland and completed all necessary procedures for taking delivery from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on July 10, 1967. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs unreasonably detained and refused to release them. For this reason, the Chinese Embassy's Charge d'Affaires, Xie Yisheng, had conducted two serious negotiations with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs and lodged strong protests. In reply to the Chinese Embassy's note of protest dated Aug. 15, 1967, regarding the looting of a Chinese chartered ship in the port of Colombo, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense and Foreign Affairs on Aug. 19, 1967, brazenly announced its refusal to return the badges of Chairman Mao to the Chinese Embassy. This is not only a serious infringement of our diplomatic privileges and a gross violation of the minimum norms of international relations, but also a serious political provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese people are greatly indignant about this, and the Chinese Embassy, on instructions, has lodged the strongest protest with the Sri Lankan government!"

	The note pointed out that the Chinese Embassy's receipt of badges of our great leader Chairman Mao from the mainland is a sacred right that cannot be infringed upon, and the Sri Lankan government has no right to interfere. Chairman Mao is the beloved leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people. The Chinese people and the people of the world wear the badges of Chairman Mao out of deep affection and boundless respect for him. The Chinese Embassy's presentation of Chairman Mao badges to the friendly people of Sri Lanka is a normal activity to promote friendship between the two peoples, fully in accordance with international practice. The Sri Lankan government must stop its rude interference in the normal activities of our embassy!

	The note said: "The Sri Lankan government's detention of the badges of Chairman Mao and the use of and incitement of reactionary newspapers to spread rumors and incite anti-China sentiment in an attempt to escape the responsibility for worsening relations between the two countries. China absolutely cannot tolerate this serious anti-China provocation. You are so afraid of the badges of our great leader Chairman Mao, so afraid of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, this can only show your weak nature, and can only further expose your true colors as an imperialist, revisionist, anti-China jester."

	The note finally emphasized: "The Chinese Embassy warns the Sri Lankan government again: those who are anti-China will have no good ending. You must stop all provocative actions against the Chinese Embassy and immediately instruct the Sri Lankan customs authorities to return the badges of Chairman Mao to the Chinese Embassy, not missing a single one, otherwise, the Sri Lankan government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this."

　　我使馆最强烈抗议锡兰政府的严重政治挑衅
　　锡兰政府反华是害怕伟大的毛泽东思想
　　再次警告锡兰政府充当帝修反华小丑绝没有好下场
    新华社科伦坡二日电　中国驻锡兰大使馆一日照会锡兰国防、外交部，最强烈抗议锡兰政府无理扣留和拒绝把我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席的像章交还中国大使馆的严重政治挑衅事件。照会再次警告锡兰政府必须停止对中国大使馆的一切挑衅行为，立即把毛主席像章交还中国大使馆。
    照会说：“中国驻锡兰大使馆从国内运来中国人民伟大领袖毛主席像章三百枚，于一九六七年七月十日向锡兰国防、外交部办理了一切必要的提取手续，锡兰国防、外交部无理扣压不放。为此，中国大使馆临时代办奚业胜曾两次向锡兰国防、外交部进行了严正交涉并提出了强烈抗议。锡兰国防、外交部在一九六七年八月十九日答复中国大使馆一九六七年八月十五日关于中国期租船在科伦坡港口被抢劫的抗议照会中，悍然宣布拒绝把毛主席像章交还中国大使馆。这不仅是严重侵犯我外交特权，粗暴地践踏了国际关系的起码准则，而且是对中国人民的严重政治挑衅。中国人民对此表示极大愤慨，中国大使馆奉命向锡兰政府提出最强烈的抗议！”
    照会指出，中国大使馆得到从国内寄来的我们伟大领袖毛主席像章，是神圣不可侵犯的权利，锡兰政府根本无权过问。毛主席是中国人民和世界人民敬爱的领袖，是中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳。中国人民和世界人民佩戴毛主席像章，是出于对毛主席的深厚感情和无限崇敬。中国大使馆向友好的锡兰人民赠送毛主席像章，完全是促进两国人民友谊的正常活动，完全符合国际惯例。锡兰政府必须停止它对我使馆正常活动的粗暴干涉！
    照会说：“锡兰政府扣留毛主席像章，还利用和唆使反动报纸就此造谣煽动反华，企图逃脱恶化两国关系的罪责。中国绝对不能容忍这一严重的反华挑衅事件。你们这样害怕我们伟大领袖毛主席像章，害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想，这只能表明你们虚弱的本质，只能再一次暴露你们充当帝修反的反华小丑的真面目。”
    照会最后强调说：“中国大使馆再次警告锡兰政府：反华的人绝对没有好下场。你们必须停止对中国大使馆的一切挑衅行为，立即通知锡兰海关当局把毛主席像章交还中国大使馆，一个也不能少，少一个也不行，否则，锡兰政府必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。”
