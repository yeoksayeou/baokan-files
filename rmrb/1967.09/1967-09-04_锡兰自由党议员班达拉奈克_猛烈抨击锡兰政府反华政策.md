Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP Bandaranayake strongly criticizes Sri Lankan government's anti-China policy

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Colombo, Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake delivered a speech in the parliament on August 22, strongly criticizing the Sri Lankan government's anti-China policy.

	According to a report in the Sri Lankan Daily News on August 23, Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake, wearing a Chairman Mao badge on his chest and holding a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his hand, condemned the Sri Lankan government's attempt to shift the blame for the robbery of Chinese export goods and diplomatic items from the Chinese Embassy in the port of Colombo. He pointed out that the photo of Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, was torn up, and books were destroyed. The Sri Lankan government is responsible for this. He said that obviously, this was done by the anti-China reactionary clique in Colombo, a provocation against the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and an attempt to sabotage the friendship between Sri Lanka and China.

	S.W.R.R.D. Bandaranayake also condemned the Sri Lankan government for creating the "Two Chinas" policy and colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

	According to the report, Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP and former minister Ilangaratne also condemned the Sri Lankan government in his parliamentary speech for allowing Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek clique members to attend various meetings in Sri Lanka, plotting the "Two Chinas" conspiracy.

　　猛烈抨击锡兰政府反华政策
    据新华社科伦坡电　锡兰自由党议员班达拉奈克八月二十二日在议会发表讲话，猛烈抨击锡兰政府推行反华政策。
    据锡兰《每日新闻》二十三日报道，锡兰自由党议员塞·迪·班达拉奈克胸前佩戴毛主席像章，手里拿着《毛主席语录》二十二日在众议院谴责锡兰政府企图推卸在科伦坡港口抢劫中国出口物资和中国大使馆的外交物品的责任。他指出，中国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席的照片被撕碎了，书被毁坏了，锡兰政府对此负有责任。他说，显然，那是科伦坡的反华反动集团干的，是对中国政府和中国人民的挑衅，是破坏锡兰和中国之间存在的友谊的图谋。
    塞·迪·班达拉奈克还谴责锡兰政府制造“两个中国”，同蒋帮勾勾搭搭。
    据报道，锡兰自由党议员、前部长伊兰加拉特尼在议会讲话时，也谴责锡兰政府让台湾蒋帮分子到锡兰出席各种会议，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
