Respected Prime Minister Ambrwaise Numaazale,
Respected Congolese (Brazzaville) friends,
Friends,
Comrades:

At this moment when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, and the people of the whole country are rejoicing and celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Prime Minister Numaazale and the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Revolutionary Movement and government delegation, bringing the friendship of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people, have come to our country for a friendly visit and to celebrate the National Day with us. We are very pleased. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my personal capacity, I extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Numaazale and the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends.

The people of Brazzaville, Congo, have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. After nearly a hundred years of unyielding heroic struggles, the Congolese (Brazzaville) people finally won initial independence in early 1960. Then, in August 1963, they overthrew the Yulu puppet regime and achieved victory in the August Revolution. Over the past four years, the Congolese (Brazzaville) people, in order to defend national independence and safeguard state sovereignty, have continued their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their running dogs led by the United States, foiling the enemy's numerous attempts at subversion and sabotage, and achieving one victory after another. The Congolese (Brazzaville) government and people have made active efforts in building their own country; in international affairs, they have pursued a policy of non-alignment and actively supported the struggle of African brothers for national independence and the maintenance of national independence. The Chinese people praise these achievements of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and wish them continued victories.

Imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their running dogs are not reconciled to their failures in Congo (Brazzaville). They are engaged in various plots and are making frenzied counterattacks. However, we believe that as long as the Congolese (Brazzaville) people unite as one and continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, and fight resolutely, then no matter how cunning and ferocious the enemy is, they can be defeated. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, as always, stand firmly on the side of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people and resolutely support the Congolese (Brazzaville) people in carrying the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle through to the end.

At present, the revolutionary situation of the African people's anti-imperialist struggle continues to develop. U.S. imperialism wants to throw the entire African continent, especially the newly independent African countries, back into the net of U.S. neo-colonialism. The aggression of U.S. imperialism has met with resolute resistance from the African people. The African people want independence and liberation, and this is a common demand. Although difficulties and setbacks will be encountered on the road ahead, the revolutionary tide of the African people's struggle for independence and liberation is irresistible. To defend the fruits of victory, the people of the already independent African countries are waging a tenacious struggle and continuing to advance on the road of national democratic revolution. To win national liberation, the people of Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and other countries and regions that have not yet achieved independence are continuing their armed struggle. The people of Congo (Kinshasa) have become stronger in their armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its puppet regime.

Imperialism and modern revisionism are becoming increasingly isolated among the African people. The awakened African people have drawn conclusions from their actual struggles: there can be no illusions about imperialism, no illusions about modern revisionism, and no illusions about the United Nations.

Imperialism and all reactionaries may seem formidable, but in reality, they do not have much power. The Vietnamese people, by unleashing the power of people's war, have beaten the world's most powerful imperialist, the United States, to a pulp. The glorious victories of the Vietnamese people and the deepening of the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle fully demonstrate that the truly powerful force is the awakened people, the armed people. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "What is the real iron wall? It is the people, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, which can never be broken. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution." The fate of Africa can only be decided by the African people. As long as the African people are determined, overcome all difficulties, and continue to fight resolutely, a new, independent Africa will definitely emerge. African friends can be assured that the Chinese people will forever be reliable comrades-in-arms in the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

Friends,
Comrades:

Over the past year and more, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories. The unity of our people has never been as close as it is today. The strength of our people has never been as great as it is today. Our proletarian dictatorship has never been as consolidated as it is today. As early as eleven years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Because China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people, China should make a greater contribution to humanity." We believe that after this cultural revolution, we will be able to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world more powerfully.

The peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) have always sympathized with and supported each other in the long struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, friendly relations between the two countries have developed satisfactorily. Prime Minister Numaazale and the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends' visit to our country this time will certainly make new contributions to the enhancement of friendship between our two countries. Please allow me to wish Prime Minister Numaazale and the Congolese (Brazzaville) friends a complete success in their visit this time.

Now, let us all raise our glasses,

To the health and long life of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao,
To new victories in the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations,
To the great unity of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism,
To the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Congo (Brazzaville) in the struggle against imperialism,
To the health of President Massamba-Debat,
To the health of Prime Minister Numaazale,
To the health of the Congolese (Brazzaville) guests,
To the health of the envoys and their spouses present,
To the health of the friends and comrades present,

Cheers!

    周恩来总理在欢迎努马扎莱总理宴会上讲话
    中国坚决支持刚果（布）人民把反帝斗争进行到底
    新华社二十八日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎努马扎莱总理宴会上的讲话尊敬的安布鲁瓦斯·努马扎莱总理阁下，尊敬的刚果（布）朋友们，朋友们，同志们：
    正当我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利，全国人民欢欣鼓舞，迎接中华人民共和国成立十八周年的时候，总理阁下率领刚果（布）全国革命运动和政府代表团，带着刚果（布）人民的友谊，前来我国进行友好访问，并且同我们一起欢度国庆，我们感到十分高兴。我代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    布拉柴维尔刚果人民具有反帝斗争的光荣传统。经过将近一百年前赴后继的英勇斗争，刚果（布）人民终于在一九六○年初赢得了初步的独立。接着，又在一九六三年八月推翻了尤卢傀儡政权，取得了八月革命的胜利。四年来，刚果（布）人民为了捍卫民族独立和维护国家主权，继续进行着反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗的斗争，粉碎了敌人多次的颠覆和破坏，取得了一个又一个的胜利。刚果（布）政府和人民在建设自己的国家方面，作出了积极的努力；在国际事务方面，奉行不结盟的对外政策，积极支持非洲兄弟争取和维护民族独立的斗争。中国人民赞扬刚果（布）人民的这些成就，并且祝愿他们不断取得新的胜利。
    帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗，是不甘心于他们在刚果（布）的失败的。他们进行种种阴谋活动，疯狂进行反扑。但是，我们相信，只要刚果（布）人民团结一致，继续发扬反帝反殖的光荣传统，坚决斗争，那么，不管敌人如何狡猾和凶恶，都是可以战胜的。中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，坚定地站在刚果（布）人民一边，坚决支持刚果（布）人民把反帝革命斗争进行到底。
    目前非洲人民反帝斗争的革命形势继续向前发展。美国帝国主义要把整个非洲，特别是新独立的非洲国家，重新投入美国新殖民主义的罗网。美帝国主义的侵略，遭到非洲人民的坚决抵抗。非洲人民要独立，要解放，这是共同的要求。尽管在前进的道路上会遇到困难和挫折，但是非洲人民要独立、要解放的革命潮流是不可阻挡的。为了保卫胜利果实，已经独立的非洲国家人民，正在进行着顽强的斗争，在民族民主革命的道路上继续前进。为了争取民族解放，还没有取得独立的安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚等国家和地区的人民，继续坚持武装斗争。刚果（金）人民在反对美帝国主义及其傀儡政权的武装斗争中，锻炼得更坚强了。
    帝国主义和现代修正主义在非洲人民中，越来越孤立了。觉醒了的非洲人民从实际斗争中得出结论：对帝国主义决不可存有任何幻想，对现代修正主义决不可存有任何幻想，对联合国同样决不可存有任何幻想。
    帝国主义和一切反动派看起来样子是可怕的，其实并没有什么了不起的力量。越南人民发挥人民战争的威力，把世界上最强大的帝国主义美国侵略者打得落花流水。越南人民的辉煌胜利，非洲人民反帝革命斗争的深入开展，都充分说明了真正强大的力量是觉醒了的人民，是武装起来的人民。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”非洲的命运只能由非洲人民来决定。只要非洲人民下定决心，排除万难，再接再厉地坚持斗争，一个独立自主的新非洲是一定会出现的。非洲朋友可以相信，中国人民将永远是非洲人民反帝革命斗争的可靠战友。
    朋友们，同志们：
    一年多以来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的胜利。我国人民的团结，从来没有象今天这样紧密。我国人民的力量，从来没有象今天这样强大。我国的无产阶级专政，从来没有象今天这样巩固。早在十一年前，毛主席就指出：“因为中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。”我们相信，经过这场文化大革命，我们将能够更有力地支援亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    中国和刚果（布）两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的长期斗争中，一向是互相同情、互相支持的。自从两国建交以来，两国的友好关系获得令人满意的发展。总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们这次来我国访问，必将为增进我们两国的友谊，作出新的贡献。请允许我预祝总理阁下和刚果（布）朋友们的这次访问，获得圆满成功。
    现在，请大家共同举杯，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康长寿，
    为被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的新胜利，
    为亚非人民反帝大团结，
    为中国、刚果（布）两国人民反帝斗争的战斗友谊，
    为马桑巴—代巴总统阁下的健康，
    为努马扎莱总理阁下的健康，
    为刚果（布）贵宾们的健康，
    为在座的使节和夫人的健康，
    为在座的朋友们和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
