Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanxi Province's agricultural production is flourishing. Following the bumper harvest of summer crops, the province has achieved another bumper harvest of autumn crops. Judging from the crop growth and initial harvest results, the province's grain yield will surpass any previous year.

Shanxi Province's agricultural production is thriving, a result of the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is also a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought in command, there is no failure in class struggle and production struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shanxi, while implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," have encountered attempts by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to incite peasants to leave their production posts, aiming to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, who have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have exposed and foiled their plots, firmly holding their production posts, and ensuring that agricultural work is carried out without delay.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shanxi have made revolutionary criticism the key to all rural work. They have exposed, criticized, and eradicated the revisionist line that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanxi have been promoting in various fronts in rural areas for many years. Many poor and lower-middle peasants have reflected that through revolutionary criticism, people have come to hate capitalism and revisionism even more, love the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought even more, have greater enthusiasm for collective production, more revolutionary vigor, and better production.

Since this year, a high tide of earnestly learning from and catching up with Dazhai has swept across the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province. In learning from and catching up with Dazhai, various places, like Dazhai Brigade, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, vigorously promoting the thought revolutionization of the people, which has powerfully promoted production. The entire province, in the high tide of learning from and catching up with Dazhai, has newly built various water conservancy projects totaling more than 25,000, expanded irrigated land by 780,000 mu, planted 12 million mu of trees in the spring, planted more than 140 million trees, and also made significant progress in livestock and sideline production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, September 19th: In the new high tide of revolutionary criticism in rural areas, the harvest of autumn grain crops in Guizhou has been fully launched. From the already harvested grain crops, the average yield per mu has generally increased compared to previous years, and a bumper harvest is assured.

This autumn harvest is the first autumn harvest season since the Guizhou proletarian revolutionary factions took power. The harvest area is large, the quality requirements are high, and the autumn harvest season is long with frequent rains. Class struggle is also very sharp and complex. Doing a good job in the autumn harvest is not only a tense production struggle but also a serious political struggle. The various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres across the province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have used revolutionary criticism as the driving force, turning their hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party into strength, concentrating manpower, material resources, and livestock, and launching the autumn harvest campaign. Because the broad revolutionary masses have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasized politics, and guided the autumn harvest with the great Mao Zedong Thought, they have great confidence and enthusiasm for doing a good job in autumn harvest production. The autumn harvest work is proceeding well and quickly, basically achieving the goal of harvesting as soon as it ripens. Many places have achieved fine harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain is collected.

    毛泽东思想统帅生产斗争无往而不胜
　　山西大秋作物丰收　贵州粮食产量提高
    据新华社太原二十一日电　在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，山西省农业生产呈现一派大好形势。继夏季作物大丰收之后，全省又夺得了秋收作物大丰收。从庄稼长势和初步收获情况看，全省粮食产量将超过历史上任何一年。
    山西省农业生产呈现一派大好形势，是广大社员和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步活学活用毛主席著作的结果；是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。毛泽东思想挂了帅，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中就无往而不胜。山西广大贫下中农和革命干部在按照“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针办事的过程中，有些地方，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派企图煽动农民离开生产岗位，达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的罪恶目的。但是，坚持活学活用毛主席著作、用毛泽东思想武装了头脑的广大贫下中农和革命干部，识破并且粉碎了他们的阴谋，坚守生产岗位，保证了农活不失时机地进行。
    山西广大贫下中农和革命干部把革命的大批判作为农村一切工作的纲。他们对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在山西的代理人多年来在农村各条战线上所推行的修正主义路线，进行了大揭发、大批判、大消毒。许多贫下中农反映，通过革命的大批判，人们对资本主义、修正主义更恨了，对毛主席指引的道路，对伟大的毛泽东思想更爱了，对集体生产的热情更高了，革命干劲更大了，生产搞得更好了。
    山西省广大农村今年以来掀起了踏踏实实的学赶大寨的高潮。各地在学赶大寨中，象大寨大队那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，狠抓人的思想革命化，有力地推动了生产。全省在学赶大寨的高潮中，共新修各种水利工程两万五千多处，扩大水浇地七十八万亩，春季造林一百二十万亩，植树一亿四千多万株，畜牧业和副业生产也有了显著进步。
    据新华社贵州十九日电　在农村掀起革命大批判的新高潮中，贵州大秋粮食作物的收获工作已经全面展开。从已收的粮食作物来看，平均亩产普遍比往年提高，丰收已成定局。
    今年秋收是贵州无产阶级革命派掌权后的第一个秋收季节，收获面积大，质量要求高，秋收季节绵雨又多，阶级斗争也十分尖锐复杂。搞好秋收不仅是一场紧张的生产斗争，而且是一场严重的政治斗争。全省各族贫下中农、民兵、革命群众和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以革命大批判为动力，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨化为力量，集中人力、物力、畜力，投入秋收这场战役。由于广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅秋收，因而对搞好秋收生产的信心很足，干劲很大，秋收工作进行得又好又快，基本上做到熟一块、收一块。不少地方收割时，做到细收细打，颗粒归仓。
