The Vietnamese Party and Government Delegation, in the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, came to participate in our national day activities at our invitation, once again bringing the deep brotherly friendship of the Vietnamese people. Their arrival made the capital, on the eve of the festival, filled with the atmosphere of brotherly friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards in the capital, waving the red-lit "Quotations from Chairman Mao," holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and the portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people and close friend of the Chinese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, shouted slogans that echoed through the clouds, warmly cheering for the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation war, setting a great example of daring to struggle and daring to win for the revolutionary peoples of the world; firmly declaring that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will unshakably support the Vietnamese people in fighting the anti-American national salvation war to the end, until complete victory.
