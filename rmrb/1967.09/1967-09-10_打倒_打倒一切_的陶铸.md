At times from the extreme right, at times from the extreme "left," opposing the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, this is a tactic commonly used by opportunists who have infiltrated our revolutionary ranks. Tao Zhu is a representative of this type. For a long time, he has been waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, using two-faced tactics, boasting, appearing human on the surface but being a ghost inside. He is an unmitigated conspirator and ambitious plotter in the style of Khrushchev. He is a thoroughgoing old rightist and old counter-revolutionary. Yet, when his rightist tactics no longer work, he changes his strategy, opposing the revolution from the extreme "left," advocating the anarchist idea of "overthrow everything, doubt everything," to cover up his extreme rightist reactionary essence. He attempts to use this to confuse the distinction between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, directing the spearhead towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, allowing a small clique within the party who are in power and taking the capitalist road to slip by in the chaos.

This counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu has been exposed, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. However, the poison spread by Tao Zhu using his counter-revolutionary tactics from both the extreme "left" and extreme right has not yet been completely eradicated.

In Shanghai, some people close their eyes to the current good situation, underestimate the achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and say things like "Shanghai is too quiet," "it hasn't been chaotic enough." To break the "quiet," to create a "second chaos," they even propose to "boldly doubt," directing the spearhead towards the great People's Liberation Army of China.

This extreme "left" trend disrupts our class lines, damages the revolutionary authority and discipline of the proletariat. Those with such thoughts are either malicious or politically naive, but they all disrupt Chairman Mao's strategic deployment from the extreme "left." We must remain highly vigilant and never be deceived.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan pointed out in his article "Critique of Tao Zhu's Two Books":
	"In the current victorious situation, we must pay great attention to the direction of the struggle, pay great attention to maintaining the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, pay great attention to executing the unified battle deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, pay great attention to grasping policies and strategies, pay great attention to uniting the majority, and pay great attention to not letting figures like Tao Zhu disrupt our lines from the right or 'left' or from both sides simultaneously."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now at a crucial juncture. We must remain sober-minded, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship. We must firmly remember that Mao Zedong Thought is supreme, proletarian party spirit is supreme, and the interests of the people are supreme. We must absolutely not allow the free spread of petty-bourgeois factionalism, be eager for "internal war," and let our weaknesses be exploited by class enemies.

Let us follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, fight the enemy together, criticize and expose the biggest clique within the party who are in power and taking the capitalist road, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our units, further develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship.

### 打倒“打倒一切”的陶铸

　　打倒“打倒一切”的陶铸
    时而从极右的方面，时而从极“左”的方面反对无产阶级革命，反对无产阶级专政，这是钻进我们革命队伍中的机会主义者惯用的手法。陶铸就是这样的一个代表人物。他长期以来，打着“红旗”反红旗，两面三刀，夸夸其谈，表面是人，暗里是鬼。他是一个不折不扣的赫鲁晓夫式的大阴谋家、大野心家。他是一个彻头彻尾的老右派、老反革命。可是，当右的一套混不下去的时候，他就改变策略，从极“左”的方面来反对革命，大肆鼓吹“打倒一切，怀疑一切”的无政府主义思想，掩盖他的极右的反动本质，妄图借此来混淆无产阶级司令部与资产阶级司令部的区别，把矛头引向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，能在混乱声中蒙混过去。
    陶铸这个反革命修正主义分子被揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。但是陶铸用反革命两手从极“左”和极右方面所散布的流毒还远远没有肃清。
    在上海，有的人闭眼不看当前的大好形势，低估文化大革命的成就，说什么“上海实在太平静了”，“还没有乱够”。为了打破“平静”，制造“第二次大乱”，他们竟然提出要“大胆怀疑”，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军。
    这种极“左”的思潮搅乱我们的阶级阵线，破坏无产阶级的革命权威和革命纪律。有这种思想的人，有的是别有用心，有的是政治上幼稚，但都是从极“左”的方面打乱毛主席的战略部署。对此，我们必须保持高度的警惕，千万不要上当。
    姚文元同志在《评陶铸的两本书》一文中指出：
      “在当前胜利的形势下，我们必须十分注意斗争的大方向，十分注意维护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，十分注意执行毛主席和党中央统一的作战部署，十分注意掌握政策和策略，十分注意团结大多数，十分注意不让陶铸式的人物从右的方面或‘左’的方面或同时从两方面搅乱了我们的阵线。”
    无产阶级文化大革命现在正处在重要的关头。我们一定要保持清醒的头脑，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，一定要按照毛主席的教导，必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能忘记无产阶级专政。我们一定要牢牢记住毛泽东思想高于一切，无产阶级党性高于一切，人民利益高于一切，绝对不能让小资产阶级的派性自由泛滥，热衷于打“内战”，致使我们的弱点被阶级敌人所利用。
    宜将剩勇追穷寇。让我们紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，共同对敌，批倒、批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，搞好本单位的斗批改，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
