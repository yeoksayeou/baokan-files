In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, the contemporary greatest genius, the most outstanding great leader, Chairman Mao, personally inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions. The joyous news spread, and the whole nation rejoiced. We, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, are even more elated. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the skies.

You, Chairman Mao, tirelessly inspected the vast lands of the south and north, which shows that your health is excellent. This is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the whole world. We sincerely wish you eternal life, eternal life!

Chairman Mao, you trust the masses the most, rely on the masses the most, and support the masses the most. You always have a heart-to-heart connection with us revolutionary masses.

At every critical moment of the Cultural Revolution, it is you who point out the direction for us and issue the battle cry for victory. Whenever we hear your affectionate instructions, we are full of energy. In June and July of last year, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan Radio Components Factory were brutally suppressed by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. White terror enveloped the entire factory. It was your revolutionary line that inspired us. Following your instructions, we joined the great struggle to criticize the capitalist reactionary line and emerged from the white terror.

This year in March, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by Wang Renzhong, stirred up a black wind of restoring capitalism in the Hubei region. Many revolutionary pioneers were brutally suppressed again. Later, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party manipulated a few bad leaders of the "Million Heroes" to carry out even more brutal suppression against us revolutionary masses. It was at this critical moment that we repeatedly heard your voice: "Resolve to dare to fight, dare to win, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." With great courage, we resolutely fought back against them. It was also at this critical moment that you gave us tremendous support, enabling us to gain strength.

Every victory we have achieved is the result of following your instructions, and it is the great victory of your brilliant thoughts.

Recently, based on your latest instructions, the revolutionary masses of our factory have achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and established the revolutionary committee. Chairman Mao, we are forever loyal to you, forever following you! We are determined to follow your great strategic deployment, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," seriously implement your great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　伟大领袖毛主席，我们永远忠于您
　　武汉市无线电元件厂革命委员会
    在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，当代最伟大的天才、最杰出的伟大领袖毛主席，亲自视察了华北、中南和华东地区。喜讯传来，举国欢腾。我们武汉地区的无产阶级革命派更加欢欣鼓舞。“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻云霄。
    您不辞劳苦视察大江南北，这表明您老人家的身体非常健康，这是全国人民和全世界人民的最大幸福。我们衷心祝愿您老人家万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    毛主席呀毛主席，您老人家最相信群众，最依靠群众，最支持群众，您老人家总是和我们革命群众心连心。
    在文化大革命的每一个关键时刻，总是您老人家给我们指明方向，发出胜利前进的战斗号令。我们一听到您的亲切教导，浑身都是劲。去年六、七月间，我们武汉市无线电元件厂无产阶级革命派受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的残酷镇压，白色恐怖笼罩全厂。是您老人家的革命路线鼓舞了我们。我们照您老人家的教导，投入了批判资产阶级反动路线的伟大斗争，从白色恐怖中杀了出来。
    今年三月，湖北地区以王任重为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，刮起了复辟资本主义的黑风，许多革命闯将又遭到了残酷的镇压。后来党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又操纵“百万雄师”的少数坏头头，对我们无产阶级革命派进行了更加残酷的镇压。就在这个时候，我们不断地听到您老人家的声音：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们以大无畏的气概，向他们进行了坚决的斗争。也就是在这个关键时刻，又是您老人家给我们以巨大的支持，使我们获得了力量。
    我们取得的每一个胜利，都是听您老人家的话的结果，都是您老人家的光辉思想的伟大胜利。
    最近，我们厂的无产阶级革命派根据您的最新指示，实现了革命的大联合，实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了革命委员会。毛主席呀毛主席！我们永远忠于您，永远跟着您！我们决心紧跟您的伟大战略部署，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命“三结合”，认真执行您的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
