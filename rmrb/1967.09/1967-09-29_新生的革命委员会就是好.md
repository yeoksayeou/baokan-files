The Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth Motor Vehicle Depot of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Bureau was elected by the masses after thorough discussion and deliberation. The elected comrades are not only revolutionary vanguards who charge into battle but also models in production and work, enjoying high prestige among the masses. The masses praise them, saying, "The power we have seized is in the hands of such a revolutionary committee, and we trust them and feel at ease."

The comrades of this depot's Revolutionary Committee indeed have a completely new revolutionary style.

After the Revolutionary Committee was established, the first thing they did was to require all revolutionary rebels and revolutionary comrades in the depot to place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position of primacy, making it the most important, urgent, and supreme task. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to thoroughly criticize and repudiate bourgeois ideology and to establish proletarian ideology, launching a vigorous campaign of criticism and repudiation to turn the motor vehicle depot into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they further improved the study system, with each class and group establishing Mao Zedong Thought propagandists to guide the study concretely, quickly launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the depot.

Every member of the Revolutionary Committee pays attention to acting according to Mao Zedong Thought in everything, resolutely opposing the decadent and vulgar bourgeois style. When the Revolutionary Committee was first established, some comrades addressed the committee members as "Director So-and-So" and "Commissioner So-and-So"; when they spoke on stage, the masses would applaud in welcome. Upon discovering these situations, they immediately became alert and required that comrades address the Revolutionary Committee members as "comrade" and that no one applaud for the Revolutionary Committee members at any meeting, big or small.

From the first day the Revolutionary Committee was established, they paid attention to participating in collective productive labor as ordinary laborers. Drivers still drove trucks, mechanics still wielded hammers and pliers, and other cadres also participated in physical labor on a regular basis. Workers saw their leaders often not leaving the driver's cab or workshop, with greasy hands and dirty bodies, and were overjoyed. Some comrades who did not yet fully understand their actions said, "As long as you handle the work from above, we can handle production!" In such situations, they always replied, "Being an official and a lord, giving orders and despising labor, is the stinking style of the bourgeoisie. We are stewards elected by worker comrades and must never forget our roots!"

Once, a convoy that went to Sichuan to perform transportation tasks returned to the depot. Due to the rugged roads, the vehicles were severely worn out, and more than fifty vehicles were sent to the maintenance shop at once, presenting heavy maintenance tasks and numerous difficulties. The Revolutionary Committee members participating in labor at the maintenance shop studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Resolutely deciding to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and seizing every moment to rush the repairs. When they lacked automobile parts, they made them themselves; when they encountered technical difficulties, they collectively researched and broke through. In just ten days, they repaired more than fifty vehicles and put them back into production.

The office of the Revolutionary Committee is set up in the former headquarters of the August 18 Red Guards. The equipment is very simple, with only three or four old desks and a few hard chairs in two rooms. When holding a committee meeting, most people have to squat on the ground. Someone suggested: "The office should add some desks and chairs and not be too shabby!" However, the Revolutionary Committee firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must always maintain the style of hard struggle." They said, "What the proletarian revolutionary faction wants is new ideas and new styles. What does it matter if the office equipment is a bit old?"

Because the Revolutionary Committee members set an example, the revolutionary rebel fighters and revolutionary workers also paid attention to hard struggle everywhere. Not long ago, someone proposed purchasing one hundred pairs of car horns and replacing all the fan blades on the cars with new ones. The August 18 fighters discussed it and said that this would cost a lot of money and was not in line with the principle of "frugality for revolution." Besides, there were still old ones in the warehouse that could be used. With the firm support of the Revolutionary Committee, old goods were put into use, saving a batch of funds for the state.

After the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth Motor Vehicle Depot, they vigorously promoted the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, focused on the ideological transformation of people, and began to establish a new leadership style of the proletariat. The workers' consciousness of labor increased significantly, and the entire depot was full of production enthusiasm, with tasks being overfulfilled every month.

The young Revolutionary Committee has taken its first solid step! The Revolutionary Committee will grow vigorously under the nurturing of the sun and rain of Mao Zedong Thought! (Originally published in the Qinghai Daily, this newspaper has made deletions.)

　　新生的革命委员会就是好
    青海省交通厅运输管理局第六汽车场的革命委员会，是经过群众充分酝酿选举产生的。选举出来的同志，既是冲锋陷阵的革命闯将，又是生产、工作上的模范，在群众中有很高的威信。群众夸奖说：“把夺来的权交给这样的革命委员会，我们信得过，很放心。”
    这个场的革命委员会的同志们，的确有一种全新的革命作风。
    革命委员会成立后，他们做的头一件事，就是要求全场革命造反派战士和革命同志，把学习毛主席著作放在大于一切、重于一切、先于一切、高于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，大灭资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，展开轰轰烈烈的大批判运动，把汽车场办成毛泽东思想的大学校。同时，进一步改进了学习制度，各班、组都设立了毛泽东思想宣传员，具体辅导学习，在全场迅速掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    革命委员会的每个委员，处处都注意按照毛泽东思想办事，坚决反对资产阶级腐朽庸俗的作风。革命委员会刚成立时，一些同志称呼委员会成员为“某主任”、“某委员”；上台讲话，群众便鼓掌欢迎。他们发现这些情况后，立即警惕起来，要求同志们对革命委员会成员一律称呼“同志”，大小会上都不准为革命委员会成员鼓掌。
    从革命委员会成立的第一天起，他们就注意以普通劳动者身份参加集体生产劳动。司机还是开汽车，修理工照样抡榔头、拿钳子，其他干部也定期参加体力劳动。工人们看到自己的领导人经常不离开驾驶室、车间，两手油垢，满身泥土，打心眼里高兴。一些还不太理解他们这种做法的同志说：“你们只要把上头的工作抓好，生产上我们能顶得住！”在这种情况下，他们总是回答：“做官当老爷，指手划脚，鄙视劳动，是资产阶级的臭作风。我们是工人同志推选出来的勤务员，一刻也不能忘本！”
    有一次，去四川执行运输任务的一个车队回了场。由于道路崎岖，车子耗损程度很大，五十多辆车一下送进保养场，修理任务很大，重重困难摆在面前。在保养场参加劳动的革命委员会成员，就同大家一起学习毛主席著作，遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，抓紧一切时间，突击抢修。缺少汽车配件，就自己加工制作；遇到技术难关，就集体研究突破。短短十天就将五十多辆车修好，并投入了生产。
    革命委员会的办公室，设在原先八·一八红卫战斗队的队部。设备很简单，两间房子里只有三、四张破旧的桌子，几把硬椅子。开个委员会，大部分人都要蹲在地上。有人提出：办公室应该增加一些办公桌和椅子，“不要太寒伧了！”但是，革命委员会牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”他们说：“无产阶级革命派要的是新思想，新作风，办公设备旧一点有什么关系。”
    由于革命委员会成员以身作则，革命造反派战士和革命工人也处处注意艰苦奋斗。前不久，有人提出添置一百对汽车喇叭，将车上的风扇叶子全都换成新式的。八·一八战士们一合计，这得花很多钱，不符合“要节约闹革命”的原则，再说，仓库里还有旧的，可以使用。在革命委员会坚决支持下，启用旧货，为国家节约了一批资金。
    汽车六场革命委员会诞生后，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大抓人的思想革命化，开始建立了无产阶级的新的领导作风。工人的劳动自觉性大大提高，全场生产热气腾腾，任务月月超额完成。
    年轻的革命委员会迈出了坚实的第一步！革命委员会将在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露哺育下茁壮成长！（原载《青海日报》，本报有删改）
