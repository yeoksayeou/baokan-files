Chinese sports coaches, who were subjected to unreasonable persecution by the Tunisian government, issued a written farewell message to the people and sports friends of Tunisia before leaving the country on September 16.

The message states: "Facts have proven that the Tunisian reactionary government's invitation for Chinese coaches to work in Tunisia was not at all for the purpose of developing friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples. The Tunisian reactionary government, led by Bourguiba, has pushed the relations between the two countries to an unprecedentedly deteriorating state, arousing the extreme indignation of the Chinese people. The Chinese coaches can no longer tolerate this and cannot continue their work here. The Chinese government has no choice but to recall the four Chinese coaches to express strong protest against the Tunisian reactionary government."

The message further states that the Chinese coaches came to Tunisia following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao said: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Over the past year, the Chinese coaches have followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, working diligently and earnestly, and have established a deep, brotherly friendship with the Tunisian people.

The message praises the courage shown by the Tunisian people in their struggle against the armed aggression of the U.S., Britain, and Israel on Arab countries.

The message points out that the Tunisian reactionary government, "as the anti-imperialist tide in Tunisia and Arab countries continues to rise, has intensified its hostility and sabotage of the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples. They are terrified and hateful of the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, fearing that the Tunisian people will rise up to overthrow the reactionary rule of American and British imperialism and themselves." Therefore, "they have further participated in the anti-China conspiracies instigated by American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism."

The message concludes: "We are convinced that those who oppose China will not have a good ending. The Bourguiba reactionary government, which sabotages the friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples, will not have a good ending either. The friendly relations between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples will ultimately break through all obstacles and difficulties, and achieve consolidation and development."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 19, four Chinese sports coaches, Hua Zhengde, Meng Guangcai, Chen Kaiyuan, and Zhao Wuxiong, who have been helping Tunisia develop its sports, returned to Beijing by plane this evening. They were recalled by the Chinese government after the Tunisian government recently created a series of new serious anti-China incidents.

Hua Zhengde and the other four comrades, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, stepped off the plane. Together with the welcoming crowd, they shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital presented Hua Zhengde and the other four comrades with "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges.

    我体育教练向突尼斯人民发表告别书面谈话
    突尼斯政府破坏中突人民友谊决没有好下场
    我政府召回的四名体育教练由突尼斯回到北京
    据新华社突尼斯十八日电　遭到突尼斯政府无理迫害的中国体育教练华正德等四人，在离开突尼斯之前，于十六日向突尼斯人民和体育界的朋友发表了告别的书面谈话。
    书面谈话说：“事实证明，突尼斯反动政府邀请中国教练来突尼斯工作完全不是为了发展中突两国人民的友谊。以布尔吉巴为首的突尼斯反动政府把中突两国关系推到了空前恶化的地步，激起了中国人民无比愤慨。中国教练也实在忍无可忍，根本无法在这里继续进行工作。中国政府不得不决定召回中国四名教练，以示对突尼斯反动政府的强烈抗议。”
    书面谈话说，中国教练是按照伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的教导来到突尼斯的。毛主席说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”一年多来，中国教练遵照了伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，通过他们艰苦、认真、踏实的工作，同突尼斯人民建立了兄弟般的深厚友谊。
    书面谈话在赞扬了突尼斯人民在反抗美、英、以武装侵略阿拉伯国家的斗争中所表现的英勇气概。
    书面谈话指出，突尼斯反动政府“随着突尼斯和阿拉伯国家中反帝怒潮的进一步高涨，变本加厉地敌视和破坏中国人民同突尼斯人民的团结和友谊。他们对毛泽东思想的传播和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响怕得要死，恨得要命，惟恐突尼斯人民起来造美英帝国主义和他们反动统治的反。”因而“进一步参与美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义所策动的反华阴谋活动。”
    书面谈话最后指出：“我们深信，反华的人决不会有好下场。破坏中、突两国人民友谊的布尔吉巴反动政府也决不会有好下场。中突两国人民的友好关系终将冲破重重阻力和障碍，获得巩固和发展。”
    据新华社十九日讯　帮助突尼斯发展体育事业的四名中国体育教练华正德、孟广才、陈开元、招务雄，今晚乘飞机回到北京。他们是由于突尼斯政府最近制造一系列新的严重反华事件后被我国政府召回的。
    华正德等四同志高举《毛主席语录》和伟大领袖毛主席的画像走下飞机，同欢迎群众一起高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“中突两国人民的友谊万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”首都革命群众代表，向华正德等四同志赠送了《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。
