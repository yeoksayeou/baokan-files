Edition: 2

The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "Criticizing Tao Zhu's Two Books" has completely exposed the counter-revolutionary two-faced nature of the Khrushchev-like schemer Tao Zhu and his henchman Wang Renhe. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan are greatly inspired and determined to press on with the victory, using the most powerful firepower to encircle and suppress the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, completely smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. On the 11th, the leaders and fighters of revolutionary mass organizations such as "Three Steel," "Three New," and "Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance" in the Wuhan area, who had personally suffered persecution from Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe, gathered together. With hearts filled with boundless anger, they exposed, denounced, and criticized the heinous crimes of "Southern Tyrant" Tao Zhu and his henchman Wang Renhe.

	Fiercely Implementing Bourgeois Dictatorship

Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe stood on the reactionary bourgeois position during the Cultural Revolution, implementing bourgeois dictatorship and suppressing the proletarian Cultural Revolution. They were participants, loyal executors, and staunch defenders of the reactionary bourgeois line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. They implemented this reactionary line most thoroughly, adhered to it the longest, and used the most despicable means.

Wang Renhe's "Study Notes" was a poisonous weed that opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, "Three Bureau Revolutionary Alliance" fighter Yang Jiazi criticized and exposed Wang Renhe's "Study Notes" and was expelled from the Communist Youth League and the Four Cleanups work team, sent for "labor reform." He revealed at the meeting: At that time, I saw that Wang Renhe dared to directly curse our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao in his "Study Notes," and I was extremely indignant. I wrote a letter to expose and criticize him. After seeing my letter, Wang Renhe immediately instructed his pack of wolves and dogs to organize a special case team to brutally persecute me. The head of that special case team shamelessly said during my "interrogation": "You look so strong, who fed you? You were fed by Wang Renhe." They also stopped the Four Cleanups movement in the county, organized thousands of people to struggle against me, an ordinary student, for a week, forcing me to say that Wang Renhe was Chairman Mao's good student, trying to label me as a "counter-revolutionary." Look, how poisonous are the methods of Wang Renhe and his ilk!

"Steel September 13" fighter Chen Di revealed that Wang Renhe and his ilk brought the "Peach Garden Experience" of the Chinese Khrushchev's wife Wang XX to Wuhan Steel. They not only failed to root out the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Wuhan Steel but instead implemented the reactionary bourgeois line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number," turning the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan Steel into a cold and desolate movement of persecuting the masses.

"New Farmer" leader Gao Yuzhe said, Wang Renhe is a butcher who ruthlessly suppresses the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. He labeled the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution as black gangs and black line figures. I was labeled as someone who holds a red flag in one hand and a black flag in the other, a "Dai Jitao"; they said I was the head of the anti-Party faction, a big traitor. They held meetings to struggle against me, trying to overthrow me. I suffered from a young age, and it was Chairman Mao who saved me. Now, Chairman Mao has saved me again. I will shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" ten thousand times. I am determined to always follow Chairman Mao's words and walk with Chairman Mao, carrying the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The comrades from the seven organizations present at the meeting had all personally suffered persecution from the reactionary bourgeois line. They said at the meeting, we have countless grievances, this is a class hatred. We will turn our hatred into strength and direct our struggle at the Chinese Khrushchev and his trusted aides Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article has sounded a new charge for us. We will definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, "Southern Tyrant" Tao Zhu, and his henchman Wang Renhe.

	Stubbornly Opposing Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, all for the purpose of maintaining their power." Tao Zhu and his henchman Wang Renhe loyally and stubbornly execute the reactionary bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev, fighting to the death against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, all for the purpose of maintaining the party, government, finance, and culture power they have usurped. Despite Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe playing all sorts of tricks, they absolutely cannot deceive the revolutionary masses of the proletariat armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

"New Worker" fighter Zhao Wencheng said, as soon as the Cultural Revolution began, this poisonous snake Wang Renhe sensed his doom was near and tried every means to cover himself with a layer of protective color, attempting to sneak through. In June last year, when the great proletarian Cultural Revolution reached its peak nationwide, Wang Renhe, when writing a slogan for Wuhan University, only mentioned "carrying the educational revolution to the end," attempting to shift the target of struggle and bring the fiery proletarian Cultural Revolution into his so-called educational revolution track. This is not to lead the Cultural Revolution astray? In the "Twenty-three Articles" on the socialist education movement, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." However, Wang Renhe said that the educational revolution is to rectify the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, military, police, pseudo-constitutionalists, spies, monks, Taoists, witches, nuns, and prostitutes in the cultural and educational circles, never mentioning that the focus is to rectify the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. He himself is the biggest power-holder within the Party in Hubei who is taking the capitalist road, so of course, he would not mobilize the people to rectify himself.

Wang Renhe also colluded with other power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, issuing black directives everywhere to suppress the revolutionary masses, resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. "New Lake University" leader Zhang Weirong said in his speech, as early as April 28 last year, Wang Renhe sent the first work team in the country to Wuhan University, stubbornly executing the reactionary bourgeois line, suppressing the mass movement. Subsequently, on July 3, in a letter to the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, he threw out the reactionary, student-suppressing black program. He frantically shouted: "First, strike the most rampant and vicious enemies... capture the ringleader, shoot the outspoken bird," "drag out the worst rightist students, concentrate on struggling against them." Does Wang Renhe really want to strike the rightists? No, he wants to strike the revolutionary students, directing the spearhead of struggle at the revolutionary masses. Many revolutionary comrades, especially revolutionary youth, were thus labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "rightists," "monsters and demons," and many were imprisoned, suffering brutal persecution and bloody suppression, causing great losses to the Cultural Revolution in the Central South region, especially in the Wuhan area.

	Typical Two-Faced Schemers

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Feigning obedience while secretly opposing, saying one thing and doing another, sounding good in front but scheming behind the scenes, this is the behavior of a two-faced schemer." The proletarian revolutionary fighters present at the meeting unanimously pointed out that Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe are typical counter-revolutionary two-faced schemers.

"Steel Bureau Two" fighter Cai Xiangdong angrily exposed that on October 6 last year, our seven "Steel Bureau Two" fighters, at a meeting in Beijing to criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, criticized the reactionary bourgeois line executed by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee led by Wang Renhe. Wang Renhe, upon learning this, was terrified and enraged, sending a car to bring us seven fighters in the middle of the night, first hypocritically "rehabilitating" us, then adopting the posture of a pastor, threatening and enticing us, telling us "not to overstep the bounds," obstructing and suppressing our exposure of his counter-revolutionary crimes. As the counter-revolutionary face of Wang Renhe was gradually exposed by the revolutionary young fighters, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu did everything he could to protect him. On December 2 last year, we found Tao Zhu in Beijing. This arrogant "Southern Tyrant" desperately covered for his henchman Wang Renhe, saying, "The Hubei Provincial Party Committee basically raised the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the achievements are there, and cannot be denied." When talking about Wang Renhe's anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed "Study Notes," the counter-revolutionary two-faced schemer Tao Zhu viciously said: "You are only concerned with this 'Study Notes,' not paying attention to the big picture." He also shamelessly said: "Not to mention Wang Renhe writing a few notes, even I have written some small essays!" Tao Zhu's words are a self-incrimination, showing that the two are birds of a feather. He also said: "Now some people are attacking me, saying there are still black spots on the sun. You say, are there black spots? These issues still need to be pursued? The Propaganda Department posted big-character posters about me, I am not afraid!" He was extremely arrogant and reactionary to the core.

The other fighters present also exposed that this counter-revolutionary two-faced schemer Tao Zhu, on one hand, shot "doubt everything" poisonous arrows, on the other hand, instructed Wang Renhe and his ilk in Wuhan to persecute revolutionary young fighters in the name of opposing "doubt everything," singing and dancing in unison, playing two-faced tricks. When the revolutionary young fighters rose up to strongly oppose the old Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Tao Zhu played another two-faced trick, on one hand, sending a telegram to the revolutionary young fighters, saying he had instructed the Hubei Provincial Party Committee to make a self-criticism to the broad revolutionary masses; on the other hand, instructing the Hubei Provincial Party Committee that the Hubei Provincial Party Committee basically raised the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and not to make a self-criticism. Tao Zhu was thus frantically resisting the revolutionary mass movement, sabotaging the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Wang Renhe is also an old hand at playing two-faced tricks. In March this year, Wang Renhe wrote three black letters to his henchmen, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These three black letters are Wang Renhe's black program for launching a counterattack, continuing to suppress the revolutionary mass movement, and launching a fierce counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary faction. In the letters, he maliciously attacked our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and he abusively cursed the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary cadres. Wang Renhe and his ilk carried out bloody suppression of the proletarian revolutionary faction according to this black program. "Steel Worker General" leader Xia Bangyin was a revolutionary fighter imprisoned by Wang Renhe and his ilk. He angrily denounced Wang Renhe's various crimes at the meeting. He said, Wang Renhe and his ilk attempted to suppress the revolutionary faction, this is a pipe dream! We proletarian revolutionary faction are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, victory will definitely be ours. Under the care and support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, Wang Renhe and his ilk's plot was finally foiled, and the proletarian revolutionary faction finally won the victory.

Pile after pile of facts, item after item of charges, completely exposed the hideous faces of Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe, this handful of counter-revolutionary two-faced schemers who are feigning obedience while secretly opposing, saying one thing and doing another, appearing human in front but ghostly behind the scenes. The fighters present angrily pointed out that Tao Zhu and Wang Renhe's brutal suppression of us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, is a decisive battle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. It is either the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat. No matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, no matter how they plot and shoot dark arrows, under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, they will be exposed, and the proletarian revolutionary faction armed with Mao Zedong Thought will drag them out, peel off their disguises, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, and overthrow and denounce them.

    用毛泽东思想的照妖镜照出反革命两面派的原形
    陶铸的心腹王任重何其毒也
    武汉“三钢”“三新”“三司革联”的负责人和战士，揭发控诉反革命修正主义分子陶铸、王任重的滔天罪行
    本报讯　姚文元同志《评陶铸的两本书》一文的发表，彻底戳穿了赫鲁晓夫式的野心家陶铸和他的心腹王任重的反革命两面派面目。武汉地区无产阶级革命派倍受鼓舞，决心乘胜追击，以最猛烈的火力围剿党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。十一日，亲身受过陶铸、王任重迫害的武汉地区“三钢”“三新”“三司革联”等革命群众组织的负责人和战士，聚集一堂，怀着无比愤怒的心情，揭发、控诉、批判了“南霸天”陶铸及其心腹王任重的滔天罪行。
      疯狂实行资产阶级专政
    陶铸、王任重在文化大革命中是站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去的急先锋。他们是以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的参与炮制者，忠实执行者，顽固坚持者。他们贯彻这条反动路线最彻底，坚持这条反动路线的时间最长，使用的手段也最卑鄙。
    “三司革联”战士杨家志，在文化大革命初期，由于揭发和批判了王任重写的反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的大毒草——“读书笔记”，而被开除团籍、被开除出四清工作队，并送去“劳动改造”。他在会上揭发控诉说：当时我看了王任重在“读书笔记”中，竟敢直接骂我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，心里气愤极了，就写信揭露他，批判他。王任重看到我写给他的信后，立即指示他的狐群狗党组织专案组，对我进行残酷迫害。那个专案组长在“审问”我时，竟无耻地说：“你这个小伙子长得这么壮，是吃的谁的？是吃的王任重的。”他们还把县里的四清运动停下来，组织上千人斗争我这个普通学生达一星期之久，硬逼着要我说王任重是毛主席的好学生，硬要把我打成“反革命”。请看，王任重之流的手段何其毒也！
    “钢九·一三”战士陈涤在会上控诉说，王任重之流把中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××的“桃园经验”搬到武钢来，还派了一个省委书记坐镇“蹲点”。他们不仅没有把武钢党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来，相反，搞人人过关，实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把武钢的文化大革命运动搞得冷冷落落，完全变成了整群众的运动。
    “新华农”负责人高玉泽说，王任重是残酷镇压无产阶级革命派的刽子手。他把文化大革命中的闯将都打成了黑帮、黑线人物。我就是因为给院党委提意见，被打成所谓一手举红旗、一手举黑旗的“戴季陶”；还说我是反党的头子，是大叛徒。他们开会斗争我，力图把我打倒。我从小受苦，是毛主席救了我。现在，毛主席又一次救了我。我要千遍万遍高呼：“毛主席万岁！”我决心永远听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走，把文化大革命进行到底。
    参加座谈会的七个组织的同志都曾亲身受到资产阶级反动路线的迫害。他们在会上说，我们有千仇万恨，这是阶级之仇，是阶级之恨。我们要把仇恨化为力量，把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫和他的得力干将陶铸、王任重。姚文元同志的文章向我们发出了新的进军号，我们一定高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，彻底把中国赫鲁晓夫、“南霸天”陶铸和他的心腹王任重批倒批臭。
    顽固对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”陶铸和他的心腹王任重忠实地顽固地执行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，拚死地反对毛主席的革命路线，完全是为了维护他们所窃踞的党政财文大权。尽管陶铸和王任重玩弄种种花招，但是绝对欺骗不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派。
      “新华工”战士赵文成说，文化大革命一开始，王任重这条毒蛇就预感到自己的末日已到，千方百计地把自己涂上一层保护色，企图蒙混过关。去年六月，全国掀起了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮，王任重在给武汉大学题词的时候，却只提“将教育革命进行到底”，妄图转移斗争目标，把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命纳入他的所谓教育革命的轨道，这不是要把文化大革命引上歧途又是什么呢？在关于社会主义教育运动的“二十三条”中，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。可是王任重却说教育革命是整文化教育界里的地富反坏右，军警伪宪特，僧道巫尼娼，绝口不谈重点是整党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他自己是湖北省党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，当然他不会动员人民起来整他自己。
    王任重还勾结党内其他走资本主义道路的当权派，到处发黑指示压制革命群众，来抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。“新湖大”负责人张维荣在发言中说，早在去年四月二十八日，王任重就向武汉大学派出了全国第一个工作组，顽固执行资产阶级反动路线，压制群众运动。随后在七月三日又在给湖北省委的一封信中，抛出了反动的、镇压学生运动的黑纲领。他疯狂地叫嚷：“要首先打击最猖狂最凶恶的敌人……擒贼先擒王，枪打出头鸟”，“把最坏的右派学生揪出来，集中地斗”。王任重真是要反右派吗？不是，他是要打击革命学生，把斗争矛头指向革命群众。许多革命同志，特别是革命的青少年，就这样被打成“反革命”、“右派”、“牛鬼蛇神”等等，不少人还被关进监狱，遭受残酷迫害和血腥镇压，从而给中南地区，特别是给武汉地区的文化大革命带来了重大的损失。
        典型的两面派、阴谋家
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阳奉阴违，口是心非，当面说得好听，背后又在捣鬼，这就是两面派行为的表现。”到会的无产阶级革命派战士一致指出，陶铸和王任重就是这样一些典型的反革命两面派。
    “钢二司”战士蔡向东愤怒地揭发说，去年十月六日，我们“钢二司”七位战士在北京一次批判资产阶级反动路线的大会上，批判了以王任重为首的湖北省委所执行的资产阶级反动路线。王任重知道后，怕得要死，恨得要命，连夜派小汽车把我们七位战士找去，首先假惺惺地给我们“平反”，然后摆出一副牧师的架势，进行威胁、利诱，叫我们“不要越轨”，对我们揭发他的反革命罪行进行阻挠和压制。当王任重的反革命面目一天天被革命小将揭露以后，反革命修正主义分子陶铸又千方百计地包庇他。去年十二月二日，我们在北京找到了陶铸，这个不可一世的“南霸天”极力为他的心腹王任重打掩护，说什么“湖北省委基本上是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的，成绩摆在那里，否定不了。”在谈到王任重的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草“读书笔记”时，反革命两面派陶铸恶狠狠地说：“你们只热心这‘读书笔记’，不注意搞大的方面”。还厚颜无耻地说：“别说王任重写了几篇笔记，就是我，也写了些小品文！”陶铸的这几句话，正是不打自招，说明他们俩原来是一丘之貉。他又说：“现在有些人轰我，说我说太阳上还有黑点。你们说，有没有黑点？这些问题还要揪！？中宣部贴我的大字报，我不怕！”真是猖狂之极，反动透顶。
    到会的其他战士也都揭发说，陶铸这个反革命两面派，一面自己放出“怀疑一切”的毒箭，一面又指使王任重之流在武汉借反对“怀疑一切”为名，迫害革命小将，一唱一和，两面三刀。当革命小将起来大造旧湖北省委的反的时候，陶铸又玩弄两面派手法，一面打电报给革命小将，说他已指示湖北省委，应该向广大革命群众作检查；一面又指示湖北省委，说湖北省委基本上是高举毛泽东思想红旗的，不要检查。陶铸就是这样疯狂抵制革命群众运动，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    王任重也是一个惯于玩弄两面三刀的反革命老手。今年三月份王任重曾给他的心腹、党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派写了三封黑信。这三封黑信就是王任重大搞反攻倒算，继续镇压革命群众运动，对无产阶级革命派进行疯狂反扑的黑纲领。他在信中用心极其险恶地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席和中央文革小组，他肆意谩骂革命造反派和革命干部。王任重之流就是按照这个黑纲领对无产阶级革命派进行血腥镇压的。“钢工总”负责人夏邦银就是被王任重之流抓进监狱的革命战士。他在会上愤怒地控诉了王任重的种种罪行。他说，王任重之流妄图把革命派镇压下去，这是白日作梦！我们无产阶级革命派忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，胜利一定属于我们。在毛主席和党中央的关怀与支持下，王任重之流的阴谋终于破产了，无产阶级革命派终于取得了胜利。
    一堆堆事实，一条条罪状，把陶铸、王任重这一小撮阳奉阴违，口是心非，当面是人，背后是鬼的反革命两面派的狰狞面目揭露无遗了。到会的战士们愤怒地指出，陶铸和王任重对我们无产阶级革命派的残酷镇压，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战，不是无产阶级对资产阶级的专政，就是资产阶级对无产阶级的专政。不管他们伪装得多么巧妙，不管他们怎样耍阴谋、放暗箭，在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下，都会原形毕露，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派都会把他们揪出来，剥掉他们的画皮，把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭。
