Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Tianjin's industries, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, culture and education, health, schools, and party and government agencies have basically achieved revolutionary great unity in just a few days. Currently, the broad masses of workers are advancing victoriously, studying Chairman Mao's works, deeply carrying out revolutionary great criticism, and actively promoting revolution and production. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire city is excellent.

When Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached Tianjin, the broad revolutionary workers excitedly said: As long as Chairman Mao gives the order, we, the working class, will take the lead and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The earliest area in Tianjin to see the working class's Red Guards was San Tiao Shi. On September 22, over sixty factories' revolutionary workers quickly united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Subsequently, the entire city's industrial front also achieved revolutionary great unity. Many factories' first task after achieving revolutionary great unity was for the two factions to sit together and jointly formulate plans to study Chairman Mao's works, further igniting the enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, consolidate revolutionary great unity, and unite as one to deeply carry out revolutionary great criticism. An old worker from the forge workshop of Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant said after actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works: We workers were originally one family, but a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party split us into two irreconcilable factions, causing division within the working class. Now we have united, this is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a new victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must strive to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate this victory, and develop this victory.

Achieving revolutionary great unity, the broad revolutionary staff are in high spirits and have greater revolutionary enthusiasm. They firmly hold their production positions, insist on eight-hour workdays, and go where there are difficulties. On the Tianjin New Port dock, where ten-thousand-ton ships are moored, workers originally belonging to two different organizations, on the day they achieved revolutionary great unity, fought side by side, took on each other's difficulties, gave each other convenience, and cooperated closely, creating a new daily production record since September. The workers expressed that they must create new and greater achievements in revolution and production to respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's concern for the working class. On September 23, the day Tianjin Steel Plant achieved revolutionary great unity, the No. 2 open-hearth furnace produced a batch of steel in four hours and seventeen minutes, creating a new record for the year; the No. 2 smelting plant's converter workshop completed the task of producing 509 tons of welding rod steel per day, creating a new historical record for the workshop. In recent days, open-hearth and converter production have been continuously rising. By September 23, the day the entire Tianjin Wool Textile Mill achieved revolutionary great unity, it had already overfulfilled the September production task. The workers resolved with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to achieve greater successes and welcome National Day.

　　天津市各行各业实现革命大联合后气象一新
　　工人们决心做出更大成绩迎国庆
    据新华社天津二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，天津市工业、交通、基本建设、财贸、文教、卫生、学校和党政机关，在短短几天内已基本上实现了革命大联合。目前，广大工人正乘胜前进，大学毛主席著作，深入开展革命大批判，积极抓革命、促生产。全市的革命、生产形势一片大好。
    毛主席的最新指示传到天津，广大革命工人激动地说：只要毛主席一声令下，我们工人阶级就一马当先，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。天津市最早出现工人阶级的红卫区三条石，六十多家工厂的革命工人在九月二十二日就迅速地在毛泽东思想原则的基础上联合起来了。随后，全市工业战线也实现了革命大联合。许多工厂实现革命大联合后的第一件事，就是两大派群众坐在一起，共同制订学习毛主席著作的计划，进一步掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮，以增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，巩固革命的大联合，团结一致地深入开展革命大批判。天津拖拉机制造厂锻工车间一位老工人活学活用毛主席著作以后说：我们工人本来是一家人，可是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把我们分成了势不两立的两大派，造成工人阶级内部的分裂。现在我们联合起来了，这是毛泽东思想的新胜利，是毛主席革命路线的新胜利。我们要努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利。
    实现了革命的大联合，广大革命职工心情更舒畅，革命干劲更大了。他们坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作，那里有困难，就到那里去。在停泊着万吨巨轮的天津新港码头上，原来分属于两大组织的工人在实现革命大联合的当天，就并肩战斗，互相抢困难，让方便，紧密协作，创造了九月份以来的日产最高纪录。工人们表示，一定要在革命和生产中创造出更新更大的成绩，来回答最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的关怀。天津钢厂在二十三日实现革命大联合的当天，二号平炉就用四小时十七分钟炼出一炉钢，创造了今年以来的最新纪录；二炼分厂的转炉车间完成了日产五百零九吨焊条钢的任务，创造了这个车间历史最高纪录。近几天来，平炉和转炉生产都不断上升。天津毛纺织厂截至全厂实现革命大联合的九月二十三日为止，已经超额完成九月份的生产任务。工人们决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，做出更大成绩，迎接国庆。
