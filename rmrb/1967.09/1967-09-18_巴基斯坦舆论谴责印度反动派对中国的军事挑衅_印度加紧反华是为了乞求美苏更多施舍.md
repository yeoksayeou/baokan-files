Pakistani public opinion condemns the Indian reactionaries' armed attack on China and points out that this is a premeditated action taken by the Indian ruling clique to beg for more military and economic "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and to divert the attention of the Indian people from the domestic crisis.

The correspondent of the *Pakistan Times* wrote on the 15th: "India's military provocations on the Sino-Indian border are a well-planned action aimed at obtaining political, economic, and military aid from Washington and Moscow." This newspaper pointed out that the timing of India's attack on Chinese territory coincided with the visit of Indian Deputy Prime Minister Desai to the United States, which is certainly not a coincidence. During his visit, Desai openly sang the reactionary tune of "two Chinas." Moreover, India launched its armed attack on China at the same time that Indian Defense Minister Singh was on his way to Moscow for talks with Soviet leaders.

The Chairman of the All-Pakistan Students Federation, Rashid Hasan Khan, and the General Secretary, Mahmood Alam Khan, issued a joint statement in Karachi saying that the recent provocations by the Indian reactionaries on the Chinese border clearly show that the Indian ruling clique is plotting this adventurous action "in an attempt to prove that it is a faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism, thus obtaining more handouts from Washington."

The statement said: "One hundred million Pakistani people stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people and resolutely support the Chinese people in repelling any aggression by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs."

The *Daily News* published an editorial on the 14th pointing out that the Indian ruling clique wants to use military provocations on the Sino-Indian border to divert the attention of the Indian people from the domestic crisis, in order to maintain the shaky rule of the Indira Gandhi government.

    巴基斯坦舆论谴责印度反动派对中国的军事挑衅
    印度加紧反华是为了乞求美苏更多施舍
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十六日电　巴基斯坦舆论谴责印度反动派对中国发动武装进攻，并指出这是印度统治集团为了向美帝和苏修乞讨更多的军事和经济“援助”、转移印度人民对国内危机的注意力而采取的预谋的行动。
    《巴基斯坦时报》记者十五日写道：“印度在中锡边界的军事挑衅，是一种经过周密策划的行动，目的是为了从华盛顿和莫斯科领取政治、经济和军事援助”。这家报纸指出，印度对中国领土发动进攻的时间，同印度副总理德赛访问美国的时间相一致，这绝不是偶然的巧合。德赛在访问期间公开大唱“两个中国”的反动论调。而且，印度是在印度国防部长辛格动身前往莫斯科同苏联领导人会谈的时候，向中国发动武装进攻的。
    巴基斯坦全国学生联合会主席拉希德·哈桑·汗和总书记马哈茂德·阿拉姆·汗在卡拉奇发表联合声明说，印度反动派最近在中国边界策划的挑衅事件清楚地表明，印度统治集团策划这个冒险行动，“力图证明它是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，这样就可以从华盛顿得到更多的施舍。”
    声明说：“一亿巴基斯坦人民同兄弟的中国人民并肩站在一起，坚决支持中国人民反击美帝国主义及其走狗的任何侵略。”
    《每日新闻》十四日发表社论指出，印度统治集团想要利用在中锡边界上的军事挑衅，来转移印度人民对国内危机的注意力，以维持摇摇欲坠的英迪拉·甘地政府的统治。
