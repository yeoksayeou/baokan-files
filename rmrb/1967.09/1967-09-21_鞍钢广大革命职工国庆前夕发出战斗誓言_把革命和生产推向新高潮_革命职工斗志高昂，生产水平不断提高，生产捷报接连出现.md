On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new and vibrant atmosphere is sweeping through Anshan, the largest steel base in China. The revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation have issued a battle cry, vowing to use the revolutionary critique as a driving force, to raise high the banner of "grasp revolution, promote production," to be the vanguard of the revolution, and to be the pioneers of production. They are determined to push the revolution and production to new heights and to welcome the National Day.

These battle cries were made at the Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation's rally to grasp revolution and promote production held on the 19th. Representatives from various production systems of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the production of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation is related to the socialist construction of China and to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, the people of the whole country are watching us, and the revolutionary people of the whole world are expecting us. We, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation, will not let down Chairman Mao's trust and expectations for us, nor will we let down the trust and expectations of the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world. We are determined to grasp the revolution and promote production, and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have a hundredfold confidence that no force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the heroic workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation. There are no fortresses that we cannot storm, and no difficulties that we cannot overcome. Our vows will definitely be fulfilled!

In recent days, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation, with high revolutionary spirits and new combat postures, have thrown themselves into the creation of new production achievements and the preparation of gifts for the National Day this year. From the thunderous mines to the towering blast furnaces, from the steelmaking plants to the rolling mills, the workers have been firmly guarding their production posts and adhering to the eight-hour workday. Many workers eat in the factory and sleep by the furnace. Wherever there are difficulties, they go there. Production problems are solved one after another, and production victories are continuously achieved, with production levels constantly improving.

The revolutionary workers of the mining system, who have turned Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" into practical actions, are determined to raise the production of various ores to a new level in the last ten days before the National Day, providing more "grain" for steel production. The revolutionary workers of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine, who have already fully overfulfilled the production plan for the first eight months of this year, expressed in their speech at the meeting their determination to complete the September production plan with the greatest effort and the fastest speed. Representatives from the Ironmaking Plant and the First Steelmaking Plant also expressed at the meeting their determination to raise high the banner of revolutionary critique, to unite with the broad revolutionary workers, to fight shoulder to shoulder, to grasp the revolution, and to promote production, to produce more high-quality pig iron and steel, and to support socialist construction. The revolutionary workers of the First Rolling Mill have increased their enthusiasm and have seen their output increase day by day in recent days, creating a new record for daily output on the 16th. The workers of this mill reported their victory to the meeting. Representatives from the auxiliary departments of transportation, coking, power supply, and gas supply also expressed at the meeting their determination to be the "good logistics" in the production upsurge and to ensure the needs of production.

    把革命和生产推向新高潮
　　革命职工斗志高昂，生产水平不断提高，生产捷报接连出现
    新华社鞍山二十日电　在伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年即将来临的时候，在我国最大的钢铁基地鞍山，出现一派蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。鞍钢无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，发出了战斗的誓言，决心以革命大批判为动力，高举“抓革命，促生产”的大旗，当革命的先锋，做生产的闯将，把革命、生产推向新高潮，迎接国庆节。
    这些战斗的誓言，是在十九日举行的鞍钢抓革命促生产誓师大会上提出的。鞍钢各生产系统的无产阶级革命派代表在发言中一致指出：鞍钢的生产，关系到我国的社会主义建设，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。现在，全国人民都在注视着我们，全世界革命人民在期望着我们。我们鞍钢的工人阶级，绝不辜负毛主席对我们的信任和期望，绝不辜负全国人民和全世界革命人民的信任和期望。我们坚决要狠抓革命，猛促生产，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。我们有百倍的信心，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡英雄的鞍钢工人阶级的胜利前进。在我们面前，没有攻不破的堡垒，没有克服不了的困难。我们的誓言，一定能够实现！
    连日来，鞍钢广大革命职工以高昂的革命斗志，崭新的战斗姿态，投入了创造生产新成绩，为今年国庆节献礼的活动。从炮声隆隆的矿山到巍峨矗立的高炉，从炼钢厂到轧钢厂，职工们坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作。许多工人吃在工厂，睡在炉旁，那里有困难，就到那里去。生产中的难题一个接着一个迎刃而解，生产捷报不断出现，生产水平不断提高。
    把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示变为实际行动的矿山系统广大革命职工，决心要在国庆节前的最后十天里，把各种矿石的生产提高到一个新水平，为钢铁生产提供更多的“粮食”。已经全面超额完成今年前八个月生产计划的大石桥镁矿革命职工代表，在大会的发言中表示，决心以最大的干劲，最快的速度完成九月份生产计划。炼铁厂和第一炼钢厂的代表都在会上表示，要高举革命大批判的旗帜，团结广大革命职工并肩战斗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，多炼优质的生铁和钢，支援社会主义建设。第一初轧厂的广大革命职工，干劲倍增，最近几天产量一天比一天增加，在十六日创造了班产的新纪录，这个厂的职工向大会报捷。运输、炼焦、供电、燃气等辅助部门的代表也都纷纷在会上表示一定要做生产高潮中的“好后勤”，保证生产的需要。
