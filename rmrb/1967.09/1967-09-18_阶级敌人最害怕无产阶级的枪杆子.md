The class enemy most fears the proletariat's gun barrels

Vice Commander of a PLA Unit He Youfa, Vice Chief of Staff Wu Jinhou

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to make the Communist Party hand over its military forces, aiming to eliminate our Party and our army and continue its fascist rule. Chairman Mao correctly saw through Chiang Kai-shek's evil plot and timely warned the entire Party: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." "Every gun and every bullet of the people's armed forces must be preserved and cannot be handed over." At this time, however, the Chinese Khrushchev sang the surrenderist tune of a "peaceful democratic new stage," claiming that "the Party's entire work must undergo a transformation, all our organizations must undergo a transformation, transforming to focus on non-military struggle," and that "now it is not about brandishing the gun barrel but about entering the city with ballots." "All political issues must be resolved peacefully." This tone of abandoning armed struggle to beg for peace from the enemy fully exposed his treacherous face of betraying the proletariat and the people's armed forces.

The enemy does not fall without a fight; the proletariat's power is won by the gun barrel, not begged from the enemy. At that time, we did not follow the Chinese Khrushchev's line, firmly standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we adopted the policy of "fighting back tooth and nail, not giving up an inch" against Chiang Kai-shek, firmly holding onto the gun barrel, and dealt a heavy blow to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, defending the red political power and the fruits of victory. In early 1946, our troops participated in the defense of Gubeikou. At that time, negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were underway. Chiang Kai-shek's talks were fake, and his attacks were real. While "negotiating," he seized strategic points and launched a fierce attack on our Gubeikou. Our broad masses of soldiers and officers had long anticipated the enemy's move and did not place any hope in peaceful negotiations. They stood ready in a stern formation, giving the advancing enemy a crushing blow. At that time, the comrades of the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion, who were defending the nameless hill in the northeast of Nantai, used bayonets and stones to repel the enemy's multiple assaults after running out of bullets. The 5th Company of the 3rd Battalion, in close combat with the enemy, had eight heroes who fought to the death, each killing ten enemies. This battle resulted in the enemy's loss of over 3,000 soldiers, and not an inch of Gubeikou was lost. The proletariat's power is won and defended inch by inch by the gun barrel.

In the struggle, we realized that "the central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, resolving issues through war." "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory." This is an absolute truth. The Chinese people were able to overthrow the three big mountains oppressing them and establish New China because, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, they took up the gun barrel and followed the path of armed struggle. If we had followed the "parliamentary road" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, we would have met the same fate as the French Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party, and the victory of the Chinese revolution would have been delayed for who knows how many years.

Standing on different positions, attitudes towards the people's army differ. All revisionists fear armed struggle the most and hate the people's army the most. The Chinese Khrushchev has always been against armed struggle and violent revolution. In 1935, the victory of the Long March by the Red Army greatly inspired the people nationwide and promoted the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, the Chinese Khrushchev saw the Red Army as a flood or a beast, openly "instructing" workers in the white areas not to raise political slogans such as "supporting the Soviet areas" and "supporting the Red Army." In early 1936, when the peasant uprising in southern Hebei was flourishing, he slandered the peasant uprising as "leftist adventurism" and hurriedly issued three "instructions": "hide the guns," "dispersed concealment," etc. A vigorous peasant revolutionary uprising was thus strangled. In October 1937, when the Japanese army launched a full-scale invasion of China, the Chinese Khrushchev became even more brazen, demanding that we "unite all armed forces in North China fighting against Japan, organize an anti-Japanese army, establish a unified command, and be under the leadership of the Central Military Commission of the National Government." He openly advocated handing over military power to Chiang Kai-shek, who passively resisted Japan and actively suppressed the people, the great butcher of the people. In 1946, he openly proposed the fallacy of a "peaceful democratic new stage," which was a complete exposure of his traitorous face of selling out the people's army and opposing armed struggle.

The Chinese Khrushchev's fear of armed struggle shows that he is not a true revolutionary but a fake revolutionary and a counter-revolutionary. He sells out the people's armed forces to exchange for an official position in the Kuomintang government, to maintain the cruel rule of the exploiting class over the people. He fears armed struggle to protect his dog's life, to protect the rule of the exploiting class.

The more the enemy fears the proletariat's gun barrels, the more we must firmly hold onto the proletariat's gun barrels. We must be loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings on seizing political power through armed struggle. In the past, we used the gun barrel to win a proletariat's power, and now we use the gun barrel to defend the proletariat's power.

    阶级敌人最害怕无产阶级的枪杆子	解放军某部副军长　何友发　副参谋长　武金厚
    抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派妄想要共产党交出军队，进而消灭我党我军，继续维持它的法西斯统治。毛主席英明地识破了蒋介石的罪恶阴谋，及时告诫全党：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”就在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫却唱出“和平民主新阶段”的投降主义滥调，胡说什么“党的全部工作要实行转变，我们的一切组织要转变，转变到以非武装斗争为主”，现在“不是靠枪杆子逞锋，而是靠选票进城。”“一切政治问题要和平解决”。这个用放弃武装斗争来向敌人乞求和平的腔调，充分暴露了他背叛无产阶级、背叛人民武装的反革命嘴脸。
    敌人不打不倒，无产阶级的天下是靠枪杆子打出来的，不是向敌人乞求来的。我们当时没有听中国赫鲁晓夫这一套，坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，按照毛主席的教导，对蒋介石采取“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针，牢牢掌握枪杆子，沉重打击了蒋介石匪帮，保卫了红色政权，保卫了胜利果实。一九四六年初，我们部队参加了保卫古北口的战斗。当时国共双方谈判正在进行。蒋介石和谈是假，进攻是真。他一面“和谈”，一面抢占战略要点，向我古北口发动了猖狂进攻。我军广大指战员早已料到敌人这一招，根本没有把希望寄托在和平谈判上，森严壁垒，严阵以待，给进攻的敌人以迎头痛击。当时坚守在南台东北无名高地上的一团二连的同志们，子弹打完了，就用刺刀、石块打退了敌人多次冲击。三团五连在与敌人肉搏中，出现了以一当十（一个人消灭十个敌人），壮烈牺牲的八勇士。这个战役毙伤敌人三千多人，古北口寸土未丢。无产阶级的天下就是这样用枪杆子一寸一寸地打出来，又一寸一寸地保卫下来的。
    在斗争中，我们认识到，“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”这是千真万确的真理。中国人民之所以能推翻压在头上的三座大山，建立新中国，就是在毛主席的英明领导下拿起枪杆子，走武装斗争道路的结果。如果按中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“议会道路”走下去，我们就要重蹈法共、意共的覆辙，中国革命的胜利不知还要推迟多少年。
    站在不同的立场，对人民的军队就有不同的态度。一切修正主义者，最害怕武装斗争，最仇视人民军队。中国赫鲁晓夫，从来就是反对武装斗争、反对暴力革命的。一九三五年，红军长征胜利，大大鼓舞了全国人民，推动了抗日战争。但是中国赫鲁晓夫却对工农红军视若洪水猛兽，公开“指示”白区工人不准提出“拥护苏区”、“拥护工农红军”等政治口号。一九三六年初，冀南农民暴动蓬勃发展，他却把农民暴动污蔑为“左倾冒险”，急忙发出“插枪不干（把枪藏起来）”、“分散潜伏”等三点“指示”。一场轰轰烈烈的农民革命暴动被他活活扼杀了。一九三七年十月，日军大举侵华，中国赫鲁晓夫更加明目张胆地要我们把“所有在华北抗日的武装部队联合起来，组织抗日联军，建立联军总司令部，受国民政府中央军事委员会的领导”。他公开主张把兵权送给消极抗日、积极反共的屠杀人民的大刽子手蒋介石。一九四六年，他又公然提出“和平民主新阶段”的一套谬论，那就更是出卖人民军队，反对武装斗争的叛徒嘴脸的大暴露。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这样害怕武装斗争，正说明他不是真革命，而是地地道道的假革命、反革命。他出卖人民武装，是为了换个国民党政府的官做，是为了维护剥削阶级对人民残酷的统治。他害怕武装斗争，是为了保他的狗命，是为了保剥削阶级的天下。
    敌人越是害怕无产阶级的枪杆子，我们就越要握紧无产阶级的枪杆子。我们硬是要忠于毛主席关于武装夺取政权的教导，以前用枪杆子打出了一个无产阶级的天下，现在用枪杆子保卫着无产阶级的天下。
