This is also a battle

In the criticism column jointly organized by the revolutionary workers of the Second Grain Warehouse in Qingdao and the stationed troops, a striking criticism article appeared. This was a unique criticism article, with only two simple sentences: "Down with China's Khrushchev," and "Defend Chairman Mao to the death!" The handwriting was crooked, clearly that of someone who had just started learning to write, but every stroke was very powerful. Because of the excessive force, several places on the paper were torn. Seeing this criticism article, the workers all started discussing: "Even Aunt Liu has written a criticism article, that's really something."

How did Aunt Liu's criticism article come about?

The criticism meetings at the sack warehouse were always very successful, except that Aunt Liu had never spoken. Although she was over fifty years old and illiterate, she attended the criticism meetings very seriously. The military representative, Comrade Liu Xingyuan, saw this and thought: This great criticism is related to whether the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat can achieve a thorough victory. Only when everyone becomes a critic and everyone takes up the most sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to carry out criticism, can we thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road! Therefore, he decided to put in effort to help Aunt Liu. He studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the Cultural Revolution with Aunt Liu and explained to her the great significance of this criticism. Aunt Liu listened and nodded, finally expressing that she would definitely criticize China's Khrushchev fiercely at the next criticism meeting!

However, when it came to the criticism meeting, Aunt Liu, because it was her first time on stage, started to "stutter" while speaking. After the meeting, Aunt Liu felt quite embarrassed. Liu Xingyuan then encouraged her: "This time, speaking out in criticism is already a great progress. This great criticism is indeed a battle! If we do not thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, and let him come back to power, we will have to live the bitter life of the old society again."

When reminded of the bitterness of the old society, Aunt Liu became so angry that she fumed. She recounted her tragic family history to Liu Xingyuan while pounding her fist on the caricature of China's Khrushchev. Finally, Aunt Liu said: "This fallen dog wants to come back and bite people, it must be beaten to death! Whether I can speak or not, I will definitely participate in the criticism from now on."

A person armed with Mao Zedong Thought will produce tremendous power. Aunt Liu later became a pioneer in the warehouse's great criticism, always the first to "open fire" at every criticism meeting, using ironclad facts to strongly refute China's Khrushchev's various fallacies time and time again.

One night, Aunt Liu couldn't sleep. She turned on the light, took out paper and pen, and wanted to write a criticism article. However, she felt that writing one word was more tiring than working a whole day. She remembered Chairman Mao's instruction: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Thinking that this was also a battle, she persisted in writing. She wrote one page, looked at it, and found it not good, tore it up, and wrote again. Although Aunt Liu's criticism article had only about ten words, she spent a whole four hours writing it!

This is not an ordinary criticism article; it is a cannonball fired by a revolutionary worker at the black headquarters led by China's Khrushchev! This criticism article expresses an ordinary worker's boundless love for Chairman Mao and their resolve to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death!

### 这也是战斗

专栏：

　　这也是战斗
    青岛第二粮库麻袋库的革命职工和驻军一起举办的大批判专栏上，出现了一张引人注意的批判稿。这是一张与众不同的批判稿，上面只有简单的两句话：“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫”，“誓死保卫毛主席！”字迹歪歪扭扭，一看就是个初学文化的人学写的，但是，一笔一划却都非常有力。因为用劲过大，有几处纸都划破了。看着这张批判稿，职工们都议论开了：“刘大娘也写批判稿啦，真不简单。”
    刘大娘这张批判稿是怎样写出来的呢？
    麻袋库的批判会每次都开得很好，唯独刘大娘没有发过言。她虽然年过五十，又不识字，可她参加批判会挺认真。驻军代表刘兴元同志看到这种情况，他想：这场大批判是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否取得彻底胜利的大事情。只有人人当批判家，人人都拿起毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器进行批判，才能把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批倒批臭！因此，他决心下功夫帮助刘大娘。他和刘大娘一起学习毛主席有关文化大革命的教导，给她讲这场批判的伟大意义。刘大娘一边听，一边点头，最后表示，一定要在下次批判会上，向中国赫鲁晓夫狠狠开炮！
    可是，到了批判会上，刘大娘因为第一次上台，讲着讲着就“卡壳”了。散会后，刘大娘觉得挺不好意思。刘兴元便鼓励她：“这次上台批判了，就是很大进步。这大批判可是一场战斗呀！不把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，让他重新上了台，我们就又要过旧社会的苦日子了。”
    提起旧社会的苦，大娘气得火冒三丈。她一边向刘兴元诉说自己的悲惨家史，一边用拳头狠狠打着漫画上的中国赫鲁晓夫。最后大娘说：“这落水狗爬上来还要咬人，非把它打死不可！不管会讲不会讲，今后我一定要参加批判。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就会产生巨大的力量。刘大娘以后竟成了库里大批判的闯将，每次开批判会，她总是第一个“开炮”，一次又一次用铁一般的事实，有力地批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论。
    一天晚上，刘大娘怎么也睡不着。她拧开了电灯，拿起笔和纸，想写一篇批判稿。可是，她觉得写一个字比干一天活累得多。她想起毛主席的教导“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”想起这也是战斗，就又坚持写起来。写了一张看看不行，撕了又写。别看大娘写的这张批判稿总共才十多个字，可她整整花了四个小时！
    这决不是一张普通的批判稿，这是一个革命职工对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的黑司令部射出的炮弹！这张批判稿，表达了一个普通工人对毛主席的无限热爱和誓死保卫毛主席革命路线的决心！
