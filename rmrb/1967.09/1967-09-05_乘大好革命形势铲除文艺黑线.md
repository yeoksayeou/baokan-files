The historical wheel of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in accordance with the wise foresight of our great leader Chairman Mao, is rolling forward with an irresistible force, like a thunderous avalanche. A revolutionary mass criticism movement involving hundreds of millions of people is vigorously unfolding, and everywhere a magnificent situation prevails.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Cultural Revolution, a responsible comrade from the Central Committee, at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, conveyed the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide, issuing a solemn battle cry. We, the revolutionary fighters of the Central Literary and Art System, firmly support and resolutely implement this. We are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and to carry out an even deeper criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing the revolutionary mass criticism to new heights.

In May of this year, the revolutionary fighters of the Central Literary and Art System, under the warm care and direct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, initially achieved revolutionary great unity. Over the past few months, we have resolutely fought side by side with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, according to the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, directing the spearhead of the struggle firmly at China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line, launching a mass revolutionary criticism, and achieving fruitful results. The revolutionary criticism not only severely struck the enemy but also deeply educated ourselves, and continuously expanded and consolidated the revolutionary great unity.

In this sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we literary and art fighters deeply feel that: only by using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism can we carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units; can we deeply touch the soul and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking; can we cleanse the poison left by China's Khrushchev in various fields and regain the lost ground for the proletariat, and can we thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and ensure that the socialist iron mountain will never change color.

How to deal with the revolutionary criticism is a touchstone for us to examine our attitude towards Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and it is also a new test for the proletarian revolutionaries in the new situation of struggle.

For many years, the literary and art front has been controlled by counter-revolutionary revisionists. Under the support and protection of China's Khrushchev, the clique of Zhou Yang did not implement the Party's policies, acted as officials and lords, did not approach workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not reflect the socialist revolution and construction. They not only concocted various counter-revolutionary revisionist literary theories, madly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, but also created a large number of poisonous weeds, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, if we do not carry out a deep revolutionary criticism, if we do not politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize China's Khrushchev to the point of overthrowing and exposing him, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be carried out thoroughly, and we will make a great mistake.

We firmly respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people," and extensively and deeply carry out and promote activities to support the army, with everyone striving to be a model supporter of the army, resolutely smashing the conspiracy of a handful of bad elements who direct their spears at the People's Liberation Army and attempt to shake the pillar of proletarian dictatorship.

We firmly support the Central Committee's decision to disband the "May 16 Corps," a counter-revolutionary organization manipulated by a handful of bad leaders. Whoever dares to shake the proletarian headquarters, we will resolutely overthrow them!

We are revolutionary literary and art fighters of Chairman Mao. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will definitely closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　乘大好革命形势铲除文艺黑线
　　中央直属文艺系统全体革命同志
    无产阶级文化大革命的历史车轮，按着我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明预见，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，滚滚向前。一场有亿万人民群众参加的革命大批判运动，正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开，到处呈现出空前的大好形势。
    在文化大革命的凯歌声中，中央负责同志在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上，向全国无产阶级革命派传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，发出了庄严的战斗号令，我们中央直属文艺系统的全体革命战士，坚决拥护，坚决照办。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，更深入地开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，把革命的大批判推向新高潮。
    今年五月，我们中央直属文艺系统的革命战士，在中央文革小组的亲切关怀和直接领导下，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争中，初步实现了革命的大联合。几个月来，我们坚决和首都无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，把斗争锋芒紧紧指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命修正主义文艺黑线，展开了群众性的革命大批判，取得了丰硕的战果。革命的大批判，不仅狠狠地打击了敌人，也深深地教育了自己，而且不断地扩大和巩固了革命的大联合。
    在这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐复杂的斗争中，我们文艺战士深深地体会到：只有以毛泽东思想为武器搞好革命的大批判，才能搞好本单位的斗批改；才能狠触灵魂，促进人的思想革命化；才能荡涤中国赫鲁晓夫在各个领域里的流毒，把失去的阵地重新夺回到无产阶级的手中，才能彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，保证社会主义的铁打江山永不变色。
    如何对待革命的大批判，是检验我们对待毛主席的伟大战略部署的试金石，也是在新的斗争形势下对无产阶级革命派新的考验。
    文艺战线多年来是受反革命修正主义分子所控制的。在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持和包庇下，周扬一伙不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。他们不仅炮制了种种反革命修正主义文艺理论，疯狂地反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，而且炮制了一大批毒草，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。因此，如果不深入地进行革命的大批判，不从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭，无产阶级文化大革命就不能搞彻底，我们就要犯极大的错误。
    我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，广泛深入地开展和宣传拥军活动，人人争当拥军模范，坚决粉碎一小撮坏家伙把矛头指向人民解放军，企图动摇无产阶级专政柱石的阴谋。
    我们坚决拥护中央取缔被一小撮坏头头操纵的“五·一六”兵团这一反革命组织。谁胆敢动摇无产阶级司令部，我们就坚决打倒谁！
    我们是毛主席的革命文艺战士，我们永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。我们一定紧紧跟着毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，活学活用毛主席著作，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
