The most powerful weapon for soul transformation; the fundamental course for establishing a proletarian worldview

The great "Three Articles" greatly advance the world people's revolution

The immortal and brilliant works of the great teacher of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," shine with the brilliance of communist thought in every word and sentence. They illuminate the path forward for the world's revolutionary people and set their hearts on fire with complete and thorough service to the people and a resolute dedication to the revolutionary cause. The great "Three Articles" are widely circulated in various countries around the world, greatly advancing the revolutionary cause of the world's people and having an immeasurable impact globally.

The most important classic document of communist education

The world's revolutionary people enthusiastically welcome the "Three Articles," sincerely praise the "Three Articles," and highly evaluate the "Three Articles." They regard the "Three Articles" as "the most powerful weapon for transforming people's souls," list them as "the fundamental course for establishing a proletarian worldview," and praise them as "the most important classic document of great communist education." The Japanese magazine *Revolutionary Fighter* in an article titled "Hoist High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Arm Yourself with the Thought of Serving the People" states: "The Mao Zedong Thought permeating the 'Three Articles' is the essence of proletarian thought." The Australian *Vanguard* says, "The 'Three Articles' have boundless meaning. They point out that all those who aspire to be true Marxist-Leninists and communists can only be transformed through serving the people and practicing selflessness, casting aside all selfish individualism." The Chilean *Spartacus* points out that the "Three Articles" "help millions of ordinary laborers understand the revolutionary significance of their work, linking their personal wishes with the interests of the broad masses of people and the world revolution." A responsible person from the National Committee of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization says, "The 'Three Articles' contain revolutionary wisdom and succinctly determine the basic characteristics of the proletarian worldview: wholeheartedly serving the people, eliminating self-interest, living selflessly, and being prepared to sacrifice for the revolution when necessary." The French *New Humanitarian* in an article titled "Study Mao Zedong Thought and Act According to Mao Zedong Thought" emphasizes that the "Three Articles" "teach revolutionaries to struggle against individualism, be loyal to the collective, and be loyal to the revolution."

Currently, a wave of learning and applying the "Three Articles" is surging around the world. Many countries' revolutionary organizations and progressive newspapers, at the request of the masses, repeatedly publish and print the "Three Articles." Many fraternal parties have made resolutions and published articles, calling on party members and laborers to seriously study the "Three Articles." Many revolutionaries, even under extremely difficult conditions and at the risk of their lives, eagerly read the "Three Articles." On the battlefields of South Vietnam, the heroic sons and daughters of Vietnam persist in studying the "Three Articles" in their trenches. In Lenin's hometown, Soviet revolutionary comrades bravely study the "Three Articles" under the white terror imposed by the modern revisionist leadership. The "Three Articles" are increasingly deeply imprinted in the hearts of the broad masses of black people in America, the hearts of the indigenous people of South America. In the fighting jungles of Africa, on the vast oceans, and in many regions of the world, people everywhere enthusiastically read and praise the "Three Articles."

Many revolutionaries around the world regard the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, using them as a measure to examine their thoughts, a mirror to reflect their actions, and a driving force to spur themselves forward. The New Zealand *Voice of the People* weekly points out that the "Three Articles" are a must-read for anyone engaged in or about to engage in proletarian revolution and service to the people; it is the guiding principle for all revolutionaries. The Australian *Vanguard* in an article calls on Australian revolutionaries to "study the 'Three Articles' every day, use them every day." The leftist faction of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has designated *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, and *Oppose Liberalism* as the basic documents that all party members in the prefecture must read. A young activist in Japan who studies Chairman Mao's works often writes in his diary, reflecting on Chairman Mao's teachings and recording his own insights, using Mao Zedong Thought as his guide for struggle and action. He says, we must read the "Three Articles" thousands and tens of thousands of times. We must thoroughly eliminate private interests and establish public interests to better serve the Japanese people and the Japanese revolution. A Japanese printer, through studying the "Three Articles," deeply feels that Mao Zedong Thought is more important than food, water, and air. A reader from Tanzania, Kaishi, wrote to Chinese friends saying that he reads the "Three Articles" or other works of Chairman Mao before going to bed and after waking up, using Chairman Mao's instructions to check on the day's situation and plan the day's work. Each time he reads Chairman Mao's works, it brings him great strength and courage. The teachers and students of the twelve-year Afni Lustmi School in the Fier District of Albania, through the method of studying the "Three Articles" with questions, have further raised their consciousness and decided to dedicate themselves completely and thoroughly to the great communist cause. The "Three Articles" are nurturing a new generation of people around the world. Under the guidance of the "Three Articles," countless revolutionaries around the world, while transforming the objective world, are also intensively transforming their subjective world, forging themselves into daring, victorious, fearless, and indomitable revolutionary fighters.

Learn from Zhang Zedong to serve the people wholeheartedly

*Serve the People* has educated the world's revolutionary people. Many revolutionaries learn from Zhang Zedong's good example, determined to eliminate private interests and establish public interests, serving the people wholeheartedly. A Lao soldier fighting on the anti-American patriotic front, Tongjian, after studying *Serve the People*, said: I will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and, for the sake of dedicating my strength to the national liberation cause, I am willing to sacrifice everything, even my life. A Chinese performing arts troupe visiting the liberated areas of Laos once encountered an enemy air raid. The Lao People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding the troupe, inspired by the spirit of *Serve the People*, fearlessly protected their Chinese comrades. This fearless, self-sacrificing internationalist spirit deeply moved the members of the Chinese performing arts troupe. An Australian housewife wrote to the *Vanguard* saying that she used to think only workers could participate in class struggle, but after studying Chairman Mao's work *Serve the People* and some of Chairman Mao's quotations, she realized that she too could participate in the struggle. She said: "I am establishing new friendships with my neighbors because they, like me, are victims of the capitalist system. In the struggle against the capitalist system, I can help them. I realize that I am beginning to 'serve the people.'"

Learn from Norman Bethune to carry forward the spirit of internationalism

*In Memory of Norman Bethune* has inspired the world's revolutionary people. Many revolutionaries are determined to carry forward the communist style and internationalist spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune, taking up the heavy burden of the world revolution. A member of the Uruguay-China Cultural Association visiting China had the oldest member of the delegation fall ill. He lay in bed, deeply engrossed in reading *In Memory of Norman Bethune*. He was deeply moved by Chairman Mao's words. After recovering, he enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's works throughout the visit and repeatedly asked Chinese comrades to find him Spanish translations of the "Three Articles." He said, "One of the deepest impressions I had during my visit to China is seeing the great spiritual power of the Chinese people. Here, every revolutionary connects himself with the world revolution, which is unparalleled in the world." He excitedly expressed, "My greatest gain is learning a bit of the spirit of Norman Bethune in China. After returning home, I will definitely do as Norman Bethune did." A British expert and surgeon working in Beijing, Hong Ruoshi, diligently studies the "Three Articles," taking Norman Bethune as his example, continuously raising his ideological awareness. With boundless excitement, he expressed his desire to be a revolutionary in the style of Norman Bethune. He said: "The problem of ideological transformation is the basic problem for all revolutionaries. The first step in ideological transformation is to fearlessly use Chairman Mao's 'Three Articles' as the standard to examine one's thoughts and actions. The 'Three Articles' have made me take a few steps on the long road to becoming a communist in the style of Norman Bethune. I will walk this road for life." An American friend, Ma Haide, repeatedly and seriously studied *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, gaining new insights each time. He said: "I realize that only by acting according to Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts can one make progress. Studying Chairman Mao's works must have a proletarian worldview and class perspective; otherwise, one cannot grasp it." A worker from Guinea said that Chairman Mao, in the article *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, calls on everyone to learn from Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, "I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions on this matter. Only in this way can one become a good soldier guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought."

Learn from the foolish old man to overcome difficulties and achieve victory

*The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains* has inspired the world's revolutionary people. Many revolutionaries are determined, with the spirit of the foolish old man, to overcome difficulties and achieve victory. A leader of a patriotic mass organization in the liberated areas of Laos, after studying *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, wrote on an anti-aircraft shelter construction site: "We are the descendants of the foolish old man. We create the world with our labor." The spirit of the foolish old man inspired the entire organization, and they overcame difficulties with high morale, completing their tasks. Young militiamen in Zanzibar went to the countryside to open up wasteland. Before setting out, they collectively read Chairman Mao's *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, strengthening their confidence to overcome difficulties. A friend from Azania (South Africa) said: We must, as Chairman Mao said, be like the foolish old man, working hard in our liberation struggle. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the oppressed people of Africa.

Many revolutionaries around the world, under the inspiration of the "Three Articles," which shine with the brilliance of great communist thought, enthusiastically propagate the spirit of the "Three Articles" and Mao Zedong Thought. A Japanese truck driver and his family of four live in very difficult conditions. Due to being unjustly fired by his boss, he could only find temporary work, working for more than twenty hours every other day. His wife works in a bakery to make a living and, upon returning home, still has to take care of the children and manage the household. Even under such difficult conditions, they do not miss a day of listening to Beijing Radio and also copy audio tapes, enthusiastically propagating to the Japanese people and serving the Japanese people. They often work until late at night, two or three in the morning. The driver said: The spirit of Chairman Mao's *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains* inspires me. For the revolution, for the liberation of the Japanese people, I can endure any hardship. Although it is a bit difficult now, I believe that dawn is just ahead. Four Nepalese youths recovering in the Asia-Africa Students' Sanatorium in China told Chinese friends before returning home: You love reading the "Three Articles," we also love reading the "Three Articles," you love Chairman Mao, we also love Chairman Mao. After returning, we will definitely study the "Three Articles" better and propagate the "Three Articles" and Mao Zedong Thought.

The brilliance of the "Three Articles" will forever shine upon the world. The new generation of communists nurtured under the "Three Articles" will certainly smash the old society to pieces and build a bright red new world.

    改造灵魂的最强大思想武器　树立无产阶级世界观的最根本必修课
　　伟大的“老三篇”大大推进世界人民革命
    世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的千秋万载的光辉著作《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，字字句句闪烁着共产主义思想的光辉，照亮了世界革命人民的前进道路，照红了他们完全彻底为人民服务、坚决献身于革命事业的心。伟大的“老三篇”在世界各国广泛传播，大大推进了世界人民的革命事业，在世界上发生了不可估量的作用。
      共产主义教育最重要的经典文献
    世界革命人民最热烈地欢迎“老三篇”，最衷心地赞扬“老三篇”，最崇高地评价“老三篇”。他们把“老三篇”当作“改造人们灵魂的最强大的思想武器”，列为“树立无产阶级世界观的最根本的必修课”，誉为“伟大的共产主义教育的最重要的经典文献”。日本《革命战士》杂志在一篇题为《高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，用为人民服务的思想武装起来》的文章中说：“贯穿在
  ‘老三篇’里的毛泽东思想是无产阶级思想的精髓。”澳大利亚《先锋报》说，“老三篇”的“含意无穷，它指明，一切立志成为真正的马克思列宁主义者和共产党人的人们，只有通过为人民服务和抛开一切自私的个人主义的实践才能够得到改造”。智利《斯巴达克报》指出，“老三篇”“使千千万万普通劳动者懂得了他们工作的革命意义，把他们的个人愿望与广大人民群众和世界革命的利益结合起来。”阿根廷共产主义先锋组织全国委员会一位负责人说，“老三篇”“包含了革命的智慧，扼要地确定了无产阶级世界观的基本特点：全心全意为人民服务，消除私利，忘我地生活，准备在必要时为革命而牺牲。”法国《新人道报》在题为《学习毛泽东思想，按毛泽东思想办事》的文章中强调说，“老三篇”“教导革命者同个人主义作斗争，忠于集体，忠于革命”。
    目前，一个学习和运用“老三篇”的热潮正在世界各地兴起。许多国家的革命组织和进步报刊应广大群众的要求，一再刊登和出版“老三篇”。许多兄弟党作出决议，发表文章，号召党员和劳动人民认真学习“老三篇”。许多革命者在极端困难的条件下，甚至冒着生命危险如饥似渴地阅读“老三篇”。在战火纷飞的南越战场，越南英雄儿女们在战壕中坚持学习“老三篇”。在列宁的故乡，苏联革命志士们在现代修正主义领导集团实行的白色恐怖下勇敢地学习“老三篇”。“老三篇”越来越深刻地印在美国广大黑人的心中，印在南美印第安人的心中。在战斗的非洲丛林里，在茫茫海洋的航船上，在世界许许多多地区，人们到处热情争阅和传颂“老三篇”。
    把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学
    许多国家革命者把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，当作检查自己思想的尺子，对照自己行动的镜子，鞭策自己前进的动力。新西兰《人民之声》周刊的文章指出，“老三篇”是从事或即将从事无产阶级革命和为人民服务的每一个人的必读课程；它是全体革命者的指导方针。澳大利亚《先锋报》在一篇文章中号召澳大利亚革命者对“老三篇”要“人人学，天天学，天天用”。日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《反对自由主义》这几篇光辉著作定为全县党员必读的基本文件。日本一位学习毛主席著作的青年积极分子，经常通过记日记对照毛主席的教导写自己的心得体会，以毛泽东思想作为自己斗争和行动的指南。他说，我们必须把“老三篇”读几千遍、几万遍。必须彻底破私立公，才能很好地为日本人民服务，为日本的革命服务。日本一位印刷工人通过学习“老三篇”，“深刻地感到毛泽东思想比粮食、水和空气还重要”。坦桑尼亚一位读者卡伊锡给中国朋友来信说，他每天睡觉之前和早晨起来，都要读“老三篇”或毛主席的其他著作，并用毛主席的指示来检查当天的情况和安排当天的工作。每次读毛主席的著作都给他带来极大的力量和勇气。阿尔巴尼亚发罗拉区阿弗尼·卢斯特米十二年制学校的师生们由于用带着问题学的方法，集体学习“老三篇”，进一步提高了觉悟，决心完全、彻底地献身于伟大的共产主义事业。“老三篇”正在哺育着世界上一代新人。在“老三篇”的教导下，世界上多少革命者在改造客观世界的同时加紧改造主观世界，使自己锻炼成为敢于斗争、敢于胜利、不怕牺牲、不屈不挠的大无畏革命战士。
    学习张思德完全彻底地为人民服务
    《为人民服务》教育了世界革命人民，许多革命者学习张思德的好榜样，决心破私立公，完全彻底地为人民服务。战斗在反美爱国前线的老挝战士桐坚在学习了《为人民服务》后说：我将时时刻刻记住毛主席的教导，为了把自己的力量献给民族解放事业，我甘愿牺牲自己的一切，甚至自己的生命。中国一个歌舞团在老挝解放区进行访问演出时，一次突然遇到了敌机轰炸。给歌舞团担任警卫的老挝人民解放军战士在《为人民服务》的精神鼓舞下，奋不顾身地掩护中国同志。这种临危不惧，舍己救人的国际主义精神，深深地感动了中国歌舞团同志。澳大利亚一位家庭妇女写信给《先锋报》说，她以前认为只有工人才能参加阶级斗争，但是在学习了毛主席著作《为人民服务》和一些毛主席语录以后，认识到自己也可以参加斗争。她说：“我正在和我的邻居建立新的友谊关系，因为他们和我自己一样，都是资本主义制度的受害者，在反对资本主义制度的斗争中，我可以帮助他们。我意识到，我正在开始‘为人民服务’。”
    学习白求恩决心发扬国际主义精神
    《纪念白求恩》激励了世界革命人民，许多革命者决心发扬白求恩同志的共产主义风格和国际主义精神，把世界革命的重担挑起来。乌拉圭的乌中文化协会有个代表团在中国访问时，其中一位年龄最大的团员病倒了。他躺在床上专心致志地阅读《纪念白求恩》。他被毛主席的话深深感动了。他病愈以后，在访问途中一直热情地学习毛主席著作，一再要求中国同志替他找一些“老三篇”的西班牙文译本。他说，“在中国访问期间，最深的感受之一是见到了中国人民伟大的精神力量。在这里，每一个革命者都把自己同世界革命连结在一起，这是世界上无与伦比的。”他激动地表示：“我自己最大的收获是在中国学了一点白求恩精神。回国以后，我一定要象白求恩那样去做。”在北京工作的英国专家、外科医生洪若诗孜孜不倦地学习“老三篇”，以白求恩为榜样，不断提高自己的思想觉悟。他怀着无限激动的心情表示，要做一个白求恩式的革命者。他说：“思想改造的问题是所有的革命者的基本问题，思想改造的第一步就是要毫无畏惧地以毛主席的‘老三篇’为标准，对照检查自己的思想和行动。‘老三篇’已使我在争取成为白求恩式的共产党员的漫长的道路上走了几步。我要一辈子走这条路。”美国朋友马海德反来复去认真地学习了《纪念白求恩》，每一次都有新的体会。他说：“我体会到只有按毛泽东主席的思想办事，才会取得进步。学习毛主席著作必须有无产阶级世界观，有阶级观点，否则就学不到手。”几内亚一位工人说，毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中号召大家学习白求恩毫无自私自利之心的精神，“我坚决按照毛主席的这一指示办事，只有这样，才有可能成为受伟大的毛泽东思想指导的好战士。”
      学习老愚公披荆斩棘去夺取胜利
    《愚公移山》鼓舞了世界革命人民，许多革命者决心以老愚公的精神，披荆斩棘，去夺取胜利。老挝解放区有一个爱国群众团体的负责人在学习了《愚公移山》以后，便在一处防空工事的工地上写了这样一段话：“我们是愚公的后代，我们用劳动创造世界。”愚公精神鼓舞了这个团体的全体成员，他们意气风发地战胜了困难，完成了任务。桑给巴尔的青年民兵们下乡开荒，他们在出发之前集体朗读毛主席的《愚公移山》，增强克服困难的信心。一位阿扎尼亚（南非）朋友说：我们一定要象毛主席所说的愚公那样，在我们的解放斗争中努力工作。我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于我们被压迫的非洲人民。
    世界各国许多革命者在闪耀着伟大的共产主义思想光辉的“老三篇”的感召之下，满腔热情地以“老三篇”的精神宣传“老三篇”，宣传毛泽东思想。日本有位汽车司机一家四口人，生活很困难。由于他被老板无故解雇，只找到一个临时工作，每隔一天要连续工作二十多小时。他的妻子在一家面包房谋生，回家来还要照顾孩子，料理家务。就是在这样困难的条件下，他们也一天不间断地收听北京广播，并且复制录音带，热心地向日本人民宣传，为日本人民服务。他们常常要工作到深夜两三点钟。这位司机说：毛主席的《愚公移山》的精神鼓舞着我，为了革命，为了日本人民的解放，什么苦，我都能忍受。现在虽然困苦一些，但我相信曙光就在前头。有四位在中国亚非学生疗养院治病的尼泊尔青年，在病愈归国前对中国朋友说：你们爱读“老三篇”，我们也爱读“老三篇”，你们热爱毛主席，我们也热爱毛主席。回去后，我们一定更好地学习“老三篇”，并且宣传“老三篇”，宣传毛泽东思想。
    “老三篇”的光辉必将永远普照全世界。在“老三篇”培育下成长起来的一代共产主义新人，定将彻底砸烂旧社会，创建起一个红彤彤的新世界。
