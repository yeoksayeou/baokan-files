Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Heroes Take the Stage
Large Numbers of Revolutionary Modern Plays Praising New People and New Things Performed in Tirana, Korça, and Other Places

The new trend in the revolutionary transformation of Albania's literary and artistic circles is first evident in the creation of scripts and on the stage. In a short period, revolutionary modern plays that primarily sing the praises of contemporary heroes and reflect new people and new things have taken over Albania's theater stages.

The moving story of Adam Reka, a crane operator at the port of Durres and a great communist fighter, who sacrificed his life to protect state property, has been the theme of many dramatic works. Young worker Zhuvi Chavo was deeply inspired by Reka's communist spirit and wrote the revolutionary modern play "Our Collective's Son" in less than a month. This was the first thunderclap on the stage. Following its influence, based on the same theme, plays such as "Flag in the Storm" and "The Party's Son" were subsequently created, and these plays achieved great success when performed. In addition, the "Stalin Textile Factory" also performed the musical "Adam Reka."

The great national liberation war fought against fascist aggression to win the country's freedom and liberation is also an important theme in Albanian literary and artistic creation and is a living textbook for educating youth in patriotism and revolutionary tradition. The Tirana Opera and Ballet Theater created the revolutionary modern opera "Heroine" in two acts and five scenes in a short time. This theater also staged the ballet "Partisan" in two acts and three scenes. The "Mijani Theater" in Shkodër adapted and performed the revolutionary modern play "Before Dawn" based on the famous novel by writer Sevoçet Mesaraj.

In the first half of this year, after the collectivization of Albania's mountainous rural areas, new people and new things have continuously emerged. The "An Z. Çajupi Theater" in Korça immediately staged the revolutionary modern play "Fences Cannot Stop the River," which reflects the new things in the mountain agricultural collectivization movement overcoming feudal forces and bourgeois ideology, and the play "Land on the Cliff," which praises the new life in the agricultural cooperative.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out: "Literature and art should struggle to cultivate young people who are pure in thought and morality." The "An Z. Çajupi Theater" in Korça staged the revolutionary modern play "Fire in the Home," which mercilessly criticizes the bourgeois ideology of seeking a quiet life in the "yellow shell" and yearning for comfort; it enthusiastically praises the communist ideology of the working class, which selflessly serves the people, despises difficulties, and presses forward courageously. This play is a song of praise for the revolutionary transformation movement.

Eliminating backward customs and religious remnants that hinder the progress of women is an important part of Albania's current revolutionary transformation movement. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers resolutely respond to this important decision of the Party Central Committee. The Tirana People's Theater staged the famous playwright Kol Jakova's plays "The Berkorçina Family" and "The Girl from the Mountains." The former severely criticizes the remnants of oppressive and feudal backward phenomena against women; the latter praises the heroic struggle of Albanian women for equal rights.

　　工农兵英雄人物占领舞台
　　地拉那、科尔察等地上演大批歌颂新人新事的革命现代戏
    阿尔巴尼亚文艺界革命化的新气象，首先表现在剧本创作和戏剧舞台上。在短短的时间内，以歌颂当代英雄人物、反映新人新事为主要内容的革命现代戏，就占领了阿尔巴尼亚的戏剧舞台。
    都拉斯海港浮动起重机手、伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡为保护国家财产英勇牺牲的动人事迹，是许多戏剧创作的主题。青年工人朱维·查沃深深被雷卡的共产主义精神所鼓舞，只用不到一个月的时间就写出了革命现代话剧《我们集体之子》。这是戏剧舞台上的第一声春雷。在它的影响下，根据同一个题材先后又出现了《风暴中的旗帜》、《党的儿子》等现代剧，这些剧本的上演获得了巨大的成功。此外，“斯大林纺织厂”还演出了歌舞剧《亚当·雷卡》。
    为反对法西斯侵略，争取祖国的自由和解放而进行的伟大的民族解放战争，也是阿尔巴尼亚文艺创作的重要题材，也是对青年进行爱国主义教育、革命传统教育的活教材。地拉那歌剧芭蕾舞剧院在很短的时间里创作了二幕五场革命现代歌剧《女英雄》。这个剧院还排演了二幕三场芭蕾舞剧《游击队员》。斯库台市“米杰安尼剧院”根据作家塞伏切特·默萨拉伊的著名小说改编上演了革命现代话剧《黎明之前》。
    今年上半年，阿尔巴尼亚山区农村合作化以后，新人新事不断涌现。科尔察市“安·扎·恰佑比剧院”立即上演了反映山区农业合作化运动中的新生事物战胜封建势力、资产阶级思想的革命现代话剧《栅栏挡不住河水》，和歌颂农业社新生活的话剧《悬崖上的土地》。
    霍查同志指出：“文学和艺术应该为培养在思想上和道德上纯洁的青年而斗争。”科尔察“安·扎·恰佑比剧院”上演了革命现代戏《家中的火焰》，剧中对于贪图安逸，梦想在“黄色的贝壳”中寻求宁静生活的资产阶级思想作了无情的批判；对于工人阶级毫不利己地为人民服务、蔑视困难、勇往直前的共产主义思想作了热情的歌颂。这个戏剧，是对革命化运动的一曲颂歌。
    破除阻挡妇女前进的落后习惯和宗教残余，是当前阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动的重要内容。革命的文艺工作者坚决响应劳动党中央这一重要决定。地拉那人民剧院上演了著名剧作家柯尔·雅柯瓦的话剧《别尔柯尔吉纳雅一家人》和《山里的姑娘》。前者对压迫妇女、封建落后的残余现象进行严厉批判；后者歌颂了阿尔巴尼亚妇女为争取平等权利进行的英勇斗争。
