Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao made a famous judgment about the international situation. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The direction of the world has changed. 'Now it is not the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, but the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.'"

For ten years, the situation of international class struggle has been like this, and the current situation of international class struggle is even more so.

Today, the world political stage is filled with intricate and complex contradictions and struggles. Various political forces in the world are undergoing great upheavals, great splits, and great reorganizations. This situation reflects, under the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the intensification of international class struggle and the deepening development of the world people's revolutionary movement. Just as the West Wind falls and the leaves scatter, the East Wind blows strongly, and the arrows fly. Looking around the globe, it is a scene of the East Wind blowing vigorously and the West Wind waning.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly spreading widely throughout the world, which is the most important sign of the current good international situation. Today's world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become a mass movement on a global scale, the scale of which and the depth of its influence are unprecedented in the history of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with billions of revolutionary masses around the world, generates boundless material force, pushing forward the contemporary world revolutionary movement with irresistible might.

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has shaken the world. This great revolution has destroyed the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism to restore capitalism in China, greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and built socialist China, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and an invincible and powerful base for the world revolution. This great revolution has opened a new era of proletarian socialist revolution, powerfully tolling the death knell for imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, greatly encouraging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and having an immeasurable and profound impact on the development of the entire world situation.

In the main regions of the contemporary world revolution—Asia, Africa, and Latin America—more and more peoples of various countries are recognizing the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and are taking the correct path of armed struggle. The heroic Vietnamese people, in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, have greatly demonstrated the might of people's war and set a brilliant example. In the vast Southeast Asian region, people's armed struggles against imperialism and its lackeys are blooming everywhere, and the flames of revolution are burning more fiercely. In many countries and regions of Africa and Latin America, people's armed forces are also persisting in their struggles and developing continuously. People's war and people's armed struggle are the highest form of anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in contemporary times, dealing a fatal blow to the rule of U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

A powerful anti-U.S. tide is surging worldwide. U.S. imperialism is not only mired in the Vietnam battlefield, suffering bruises and injuries, but is also surrounded by the peoples of the world, becoming the target of universal condemnation. U.S. imperialism, like a mad dog, is running amok everywhere, drawing the ire of all. Even within the United States, the mass movement opposing U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war is growing significantly. A broad and genuine, rather than narrow and hypocritical, international anti-U.S. united front is expanding day by day.

The struggle of Marxist-Leninists in various countries against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique has achieved great victories. The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique has been thoroughly exposed, and modern revisionism has fallen into great bankruptcy. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism have grown stronger and more numerous through struggle. Where there were originally no Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, a number of Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have emerged; within some parties controlled by the revisionist clique, proletarian revolutionaries have risen up in rebellion, establishing new Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations. This has extremely important significance for the world proletarian revolutionary cause.

Under the impact of the surging world revolutionary tide, the two major strongholds of world reactionary forces, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, are having an even harder time. U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war are continually suffering setbacks, intensifying class struggle within the United States and exacerbating disputes within the U.S. ruling class and the disintegration of the imperialist bloc. The Soviet revisionist clique, the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, is facing increasingly strong condemnation from the revolutionary peoples of various countries. The broad Soviet people are awakening and opposing the betrayal policies of the Soviet revisionist clique. Contradictions within the Soviet revisionist clique and between the Soviet revisionist clique and its lackeys are also developing day by day. Both U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are in a situation of being surrounded on all sides and facing internal and external difficulties.

Chairman Mao often teaches us that when looking at the situation, we must grasp the essential and mainstream aspects.

In the current world situation, the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the tremendous influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the rapid development of Marxist-Leninist forces, the flourishing of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the surging anti-U.S. tide among the world's peoples—these are the mainstream, the decisive factors in the development of the world situation. Today's world situation is more favorable to the world's revolutionary peoples and more unfavorable to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

Of course, there is a mainstream, and there is a countercurrent. The world situation has never developed in a straight line but in a wave-like manner. Why is this so? Because there are two forces in the world, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces, engaged in fierce struggle. U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries will never accept their defeat and will never willingly retire from the historical stage. They are hastily forming anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary alliances, launching frenzied counterattacks against the world revolutionary forces. They direct their arrows at China, stirring up one anti-China wave after another. They stage counter-revolutionary coups in some countries, causing political reversals there. And so on. These are the counter-revolutionary currents in the world.

How should we view this counter-revolutionary current? Chairman Mao has said that in estimating counter-revolutionary forces, "we must not look only at their appearance but must look at their essence." The black winds and waves stirred up by counter-revolutionary forces may seem formidable, but in reality, they do not signify anything significant. Instead, they reflect the fact that these forces are trembling before the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, reflecting their extreme fear of the revolution of various countries, and reflecting their inherently weak nature. Their collusion, their counterattacks, and the various plots they hatch are merely struggles to save themselves from their doomed fate.

As early as twenty-two years ago, when analyzing the post-war international situation, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The counter-revolutionary current will never become the mainstream," "the counter-revolutionary current will one day be overcome." Today's counter-revolutionary current will be no different.

We are now in the great new era of world revolution. The awareness of the world's peoples has reached an unprecedented height, and the strength of the world's peoples has reached an unprecedented scale. The decaying imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are trying every means to stop the revolution and extinguish it, which is completely a pipe dream. Even if the revolutionary struggle in some places encounters temporary setbacks, bad things can turn into good things, and the revolution will inevitably move forward.

The fundamental contradictions in the world today not only still exist but are also constantly expanding and intensifying. Only revolution can solve these contradictions. This is the law of historical development. Therefore, the rise and development of people's revolutions in various countries are inevitable; the great Mao Zedong Thought, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people around the world and combined with billions of revolutionary people, is irresistible; the influence of the victory of the Chinese revolution among the peoples of the world is invincible.

In a word, the great tide of world people's revolution will surely break through any obstacles, overcome any counter-revolutionary currents, surge forward like a torrent, and advance with irresistible momentum. Those who follow it will survive, and those who go against it will perish, burying all imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries thoroughly!

    东风压倒西风的大好形势
    本报评论员
    十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席对国际形势作出一个著名的论断。毛主席指出：“世界的风向变了。”“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”
    十年来的国际阶级斗争的形势是这样，当前国际阶级斗争的形势更是这样。
    今天，世界政治舞台上充满着错综复杂的矛盾和斗争。世界各种政治力量处在大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程中。这种局面，正是反映了在东风压倒西风的总形势下，国际阶级斗争的日益激化和世界人民革命运动的深入发展。正西风落叶下长安，飞鸣镝。环顾全球，是一派东风劲吹、西风衰微的景象。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界迅速广泛的传播，是当前国际形势大好的最重要的标志。今天的世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。学习和运用毛泽东思想，已经成为一个世界范围的群众运动，其规模之大，影响之深，是马克思列宁主义发展史上从来没有过的。毛泽东思想同世界上亿万革命群众相结合，就产生无穷无尽的物质力量，它正以雷霆万钧之力推动着当代世界革命运动的发展。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，震动了全世界。这场大革命，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦，大大地巩固了无产阶级专政，把占世界人口四分之一的社会主义中国建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校，成为世界革命的坚不可摧的、无比强大的根据地。这场大革命，开辟了无产阶级社会主义革命的新纪元，有力地敲响了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的丧钟，大大地鼓舞了全世界人民的革命斗争，对于整个世界形势的发展产生着不可估量的深远影响。
    在当代世界革命风暴主要地区的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，越来越多的国家的人民认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，走上了武装斗争的正确道路。英雄的越南人民在抗美救国战争中，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，树立了光辉的榜样。在广大的东南亚地区，反对帝国主义及其走狗的人民武装斗争遍地开花，革命烈火越烧越旺。非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家和地区的人民武装力量，也在坚持斗争，不断发展。人民战争和人民武装斗争是当代反帝革命斗争的最高形式，它给以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的统治以致命的打击。
    在全世界，强大的反美浪潮正在不断高涨。美帝国主义不仅陷在越南战场上，碰得鼻青眼肿，而且陷入全世界人民的重重包围，成为众矢之的。美帝国主义象疯狗一样到处乱窜，人人喊打。就是在美国国内，反对美帝侵略政策和战争政策的群众运动，也有很大的增长。一个最广泛的而不是狭隘的、最真实的而不是虚伪的国际反美统一战线，正在日益扩大。
    世界各国马克思列宁主义者反对以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。苏修集团的叛徒面目已经彻底暴露，现代修正主义陷入了大破产。马克思列宁主义的队伍在斗争中更加发展壮大了。原来没有马克思列宁主义政党和组织的地方，出现了一批马克思列宁主义的政党和组织；在被修正主义集团控制的一些党内，无产阶级革命派也纷纷起来造反，建立了新的马克思列宁主义的政党和组织；这对于无产阶级世界革命事业有着极其重大的意义。
    在汹涌澎湃的世界革命浪潮的冲击下，世界反动势力的两个大本营美帝国主义和苏修集团，日子更加不好混了。美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策不断遭受失败，使美国国内阶级斗争日益尖锐化，也加剧了美国统治集团内部的争吵和帝国主义集团的分崩离析。美帝的头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团，遭到各国革命人民越来越强烈的谴责。广大苏联人民正在觉醒起来，反对苏修集团的叛卖政策。苏修集团内部，以及苏修集团同它的娄罗之间的矛盾，也在日益发展。美帝苏修都陷入了四面楚歌，内外交困的境地。
    毛主席经常教导我们，看形势，要抓住本质方面，主流方面。
    在当前的世界形势中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，中国文化大革命的巨大影响，马克思列宁主义力量的迅速发展，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，世界人民的反美浪潮不断高涨，这是主流，是对世界形势的发展起决定作用的因素。今天的世界形势，是更加有利于世界革命人民，而更加不利于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    当然，有主流，也有逆流。世界形势从来不是直线发展的，而是波浪式的发展。为什么会如此呢？这是因为世界上有两种势力，革命势力和反革命势力，在进行激烈的搏斗。美帝苏修和一切反动派绝不甘心自己的失败，绝不甘心退出历史舞台。它们加紧勾结起来，拼凑反华、反共、反人民、反革命的联盟，对世界革命力量进行疯狂的反扑。它们把矛头集中地指向中国，掀起一个又一个反华浪潮。它们在一些国家策动反革命政变，造成那里政局的逆转。如此等等。这些，就是世界上的一股反革命逆流。
    对于这股反革命逆流，应当怎样认识呢？毛主席说过，对反革命力量的估计，“决不可只看它的现象，要去看它的实质”。反革命势力搅起的黑风恶浪，看上去来势汹汹，但实质上并不表明它们有什么了不起，而恰恰反映了它们在光焰无际的毛泽东思想面前吓得发抖，反映了它们对各国人民革命的极端恐惧，反映了它们的十分虚弱的本质。它们的勾结，它们的反扑，它们玩弄的种种阴谋，都不过是为了挽救自己的灭亡命运而进行的挣扎而已。
    早在二十二年前，毛主席在分析战后国际形势时就指出：“反动的逆流终究不会变为主流”，“反动逆流总有一天会要被克服下去”。今天的这股反革命逆流，更加只能是这样。
    我们正处在世界革命的伟大的新时代。世界人民的觉悟空前提高了，世界人民的力量空前壮大了。腐朽没落的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，千方百计想要阻止革命，扑灭革命，完全是白日做梦。即使某些地方的革命斗争遇到暂时的挫折，但坏事可以变为好事，革命终究是要向前发展的。
    当前世界上的各种基本矛盾，不但依然存在，而且正在不断扩大，不断激化，只有革命才能解决这些矛盾。这是历史发展的规律。因此，各国人民革命的兴起和发展，是不可避免的；伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界深入人心，同亿万革命人民相结合，是势不可挡的；中国革命胜利的道路在世界人民中的影响，是不可抵御的。
    一句话，世界人民革命运动的伟大潮流，一定要冲破任何阻拦，克服任何反动逆流，一泻千里，奔腾前进，顺之者存，违之者灭，把一切帝国主义、修正主义、反动派彻底埋葬！
