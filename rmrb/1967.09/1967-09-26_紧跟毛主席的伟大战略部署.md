Upon hearing the great news that our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao, has inspected the three major regions, the revolutionary masses of the National Defense Office and the National Defense Engineering Bureau are extremely excited and raise their fists high to shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years! We wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

This great news shows that our red sun, Chairman Mao, is in excellent health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of our country and all the revolutionary people of the world!

This great news shows that Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat, and the most brilliant teacher.

This great news shows that Chairman Mao is the most deeply rooted among the people, the most trusting of the people, the most reliant on the people, and the best at concentrating the wisdom of the people. He always breathes with the revolutionary masses, shares their fate, and is forever connected with the people at heart, setting a brilliant example for all the people of our country and all the revolutionary people of the world!

This great news shows that whenever the revolution reaches a critical moment, Chairman Mao always personally grasps the direction of the revolution, formulates strategic deployments, and guides the revolutionary people from one victory to another!

This great news gives us a new battle order: We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the overall direction of the struggle, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance in our minds, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, prepare for war, and promote work. We will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and turn the National Defense Office and the National Defense Engineering Bureau into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!
