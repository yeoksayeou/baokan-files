The Strange "Business Firm"

The son of the director of the Kurashsky rural medical station, Lingo Gergishev, grew up like a nobleman's son. From a young age, all his demands were met. The child did not want to go to school, so the family hired a private tutor. The loving father even managed to get his son a gold medal for completing primary school.

However, when it came time to enter a higher educational institution, Lingo stamped his foot and insisted, without room for argument, that he wanted to study in Moscow. The son's will was law. The father brought his son to Moscow and entrusted his fate to a "business firm" called "Bukharadze-K," which was established in the summer of 1958. The leader of the "business firm" was the head of the nutritional media experimental laboratory at a certain psychiatric research institute in Moscow, and his assistants were a group of university students. Their combined goal was to find people to take exams for the sons of wealthy families and "place" them in various higher educational institutions, making money in the process.

The person who took the exam for Lingo Gergishev was O. Sharkisov, and the "business firm" received the agreed-upon sum of four thousand rubles for this.

In three years, this "business firm" managed to "place" about forty people in thirteen higher educational institutions in Moscow and Leningrad, receiving bribes of three to five thousand rubles per person. But where did the bribe-givers get so much money? Undoubtedly, such large-scale bribery was closely linked to the embezzlement of state and social property. (According to the Soviet newspaper *Village Life*)

Rubles for Admission

The daughter of Kim, an employee at the Kazgan-Terelya supply station, Iskra, planned to take the entrance exams. The father believed in the power of carpets. The mother believed in the power of money. For insurance, the whole family decided: send both carpets and six hundred rubles. The matter was entrusted to the university student Krayushkin.

"Can you handle this?"
"Sure," the university student replied without batting an eye.

"Dear, take it, six hundred rubles, give it to the right person."

Krayushkin had just gone to find his "own people," and Iskra had already scored two fives. The six hundred rubles worked. It had to be done quickly. Krayushkin found the teachers he knew, gave them three hundred, and kept the other three hundred for himself. These teachers were not fools either, keeping one hundred fifty for themselves and giving one hundred fifty to the exam committee. (According to the Soviet newspaper *Komsomolskaya Pravda*)

    考学之道
        稀　奇　的“商　行”
    库拉什斯基农村医疗站主任的儿子林果·格格希泽象贵族的公子一样地长大。从小时候起，他的各种要求，都得到了满足。孩子不愿去学校学习，家里就请家庭补习教师。多情的爸爸还给儿子“弄到”一个小学毕业的金质奖章。
    可是，到了要上高等学校的时候，林果跺着脚，不容反驳地坚持：要在莫斯科学习。儿子的意志就是法律。爸爸带着儿子来到了莫斯科，把儿子的命运，委托给一个一九五八年夏天成立的名叫“布哈拉泽—K”的“商行”。“商行”的领导人是莫斯科某精神病科学研究所营养媒介实验室主任，他的助手是一伙大学生。这些人联合起来的目的是：找人替公子哥儿们考试，把他们“安插”在各个不同的高等学校里，从中赚钱。
    替林果·格格希泽考试的是奥·沙尔基索夫，为此，“商行”得到了预定的四千卢布。
    在三年内，这个“商行”将大约四十人“安插”在十三个莫斯科和列宁格勒的高等学校里，每个人单独受贿三千到五千卢布。那么，行贿者从那儿来的那么多钱呢？毫无疑问，这样大规模地行贿，是和占用国家和社会财产密切相联的。　（据苏联《农村生活报》）
        卢　布　保　送
    卡兹加兰捷列雅供应站营业员基姆的女儿伊斯克拉打算考学校。爸爸认为地毯神通广大。妈妈相信钱的力量。为了保险起见，全家一致决定：也送地毯，也送六百卢布。事情托给大学生克拉尤什金。
    “这个事你能办吗？”
    “能办。”大学生连眼也不眨地说。
    “亲爱的，拿去吧，六百卢布，交给应该交的人。”
    克拉尤什金刚跑去找过了“自己人”，伊斯克拉就考了两个五分啦。六百卢布生效了。应该快点。克拉尤什金找到他认识的教师们，给他们三百，另外三百自己留下。这些教师们也不是傻瓜，一百五留给自己，一百五交给考试委员。（据苏联《共青团真理报》）
