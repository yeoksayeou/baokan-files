Great news reaches the military camp,
Cadres and soldiers are in high spirits!

The east wind blows, the red flag flutters, the victory song shakes the heavens,
The bugle sounds, the drums beat fast, firecrackers explode in unison!

In the platoon, soldiers run to tell each other,
In the camp, slogans cover the walls and red bulletins are everywhere,
They enthusiastically cheer and sing with abandon,
Great Commander Chairman Mao inspects North China, Central China, and East China.

Chairman Mao personally visits the front line,
Illuminating the revolutionary journey of ten thousand miles,
Closely following Commander Chairman Mao,
We will not stop until we carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end!

Great news reaches the military camp,
Cadres and soldiers are in high spirits,
With countless words, they shout long live Chairman Mao a million times!
With countless songs, they sing "The East is Red" in unison!

　　特大喜讯传到军营，
　　干部战士万分欢腾！
　　东风吹，红旗飘，凯歌震天，
　　军号响，锣鼓急，鞭炮齐鸣！
　　连队里，战士们奔走相告，
　　营区里，标语满墙喜报通红，
　　热烈地欢呼啊，纵情地歌唱，
　　伟大统帅毛主席视察华北、中南、华东。
　　毛主席亲临第一线，
　　照亮革命万里程，
　　紧跟统帅毛主席，
　　不把文化大革命进行到底不收兵！
　　特大喜讯传到军营，
　　干部战士万分欢腾，
　　千言万语高呼毛主席万万岁！
　　千歌万曲齐唱《东方红》！
