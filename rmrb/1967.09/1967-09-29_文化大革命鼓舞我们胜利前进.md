The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented great revolutionary movement. It is sweeping across the entire country with the force of a mighty torrent and the power of thunder. In this fierce struggle between the two lines and the two roads, Chinese revolutionary women, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, are fearlessly attacking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

In the struggle, Chinese revolutionary women are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, attacking all "private" interests, and promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, they have performed immortal feats and set a brilliant example for revolutionary women around the world. We Japanese revolutionary women must learn from you, learn from your spirit of high举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, reforming our world outlook, and rebelling against all monsters and demons.

We Japanese revolutionary women in Beijing, together with Chinese comrades, have participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and received great education. Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, we are engaged in fierce struggles against the revisionist clique of Miyamoto. The Japanese Communist Party revisionist clique, like the biggest power-holders within the Chinese Party who are taking the capitalist road, has committed serious crimes in the women's movement.

The Japanese Communist Party revisionist clique in the women's movement vigorously advocates small family happiness, fashionable clothing, and propagates the brutality of war, inciting people's fear of war. In daily women's activities, it promotes petty economic interests, aiming to prevent the broad masses of women from awakening and taking the revolutionary road.

We Japanese revolutionary women in Beijing have long been influenced by the Miyamoto revisionist clique. The Japanese revisionists do not allow us to study Mao Zedong Thought, nor do they allow us to have in-depth contact with Chinese workers and peasants. They attempt to cultivate us into a new privileged class, so that we will obediently follow the parliamentary road of the Japanese revisionists and loyally fight to increase the votes for the Japanese revisionists.

However, we have personally participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and seen how the iron broom of the cultural revolution, like a sudden storm, sweeps away all dirt and filth, launching a fierce attack on the strongholds of revisionism. The revolutionary spirit of the Chinese revolutionary masses has given us great courage and support, enabling us to make up our minds to attack the Miyamoto revisionist clique. In our homeland, the flames of rebellion are burning everywhere. Eighteen counties of the New Japanese Women's Association have rebelled against the Japanese revisionists, and four central committee members of the New Japanese Women's Central Committee have also rebelled.

We deeply understand that in this thrilling struggle against revisionism, what force drives us to rebel against the Miyamoto revisionist clique is the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought.

The great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Although the Japanese women's movement will face various difficulties and setbacks, we firmly believe that in the near future, the flames of rebellion against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionist clique will spread throughout the Japanese archipelago.

　　文化大革命鼓舞我们胜利前进
　　日本　冈田春子
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场史无前例的伟大的革命运动，它正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，在全中国范围内开展着。在这场两条路线、两条道路的激烈的斗争中，中国革命妇女在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，以大无畏的革命精神，向中国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。
    中国革命妇女在斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，向一切“私”字开火，促进思想革命化。她们在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋，为世界革命妇女做出了光辉的榜样。我们日本革命妇女要向你们学习，学习你们那种高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观，向一切牛鬼蛇神造反的精神。
    我们在北京的日本革命妇女，和中国同志一起参加了无产阶级文化大革命，并受到了很大的教育。在革命造反精神的鼓舞下，我们正在同宫本修正主义集团进行激烈的斗争。日共修正主义集团同中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一样，在妇女运动中犯下了严重的罪行。
    日共修正主义集团在妇女运动中竭力宣扬小家庭的幸福，时髦的服装，宣传战争的残酷性，煽动人们害怕战争的心理。在日常的妇女活动中，推行小恩小惠的经济主义，其目的就是阻止广大妇女觉醒，走革命的道路。
    我们在北京的日本革命妇女长期受着宫本修正主义集团的影响，日修不让我们学习毛泽东思想，也不让我们同中国的工人、农民进行深入的接触，企图把我们在北京的日本革命妇女培养成新的特权阶层，以便使我们老老实实地接受日修议会的道路，使我们忠心耿耿地为增加日修选票而奋斗。
    但是，我们亲自参加了中国无产阶级文化大革命，看到文化大革命的铁扫帚，犹如暴风骤雨，荡涤着一切污泥浊水，对修正主义的堡垒猛烈开火。中国革命群众的造反精神给了我们很大勇气和支持，使我们下定决心向宫本修正主义集团开火。在我们的祖国造反之火，已经到处燃烧，已有十八个县的新日本妇女会造了日修的反，新日本妇女中央委员会的四个中央委员也造了反。
    我们深深懂得，在惊心动魄的反修斗争中，是什么力量促使我们造宫本修正主义集团的反，这就是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“星星之火，可以燎原”。尽管日本妇女运动将会面临种种困难和挫折，但我们深信，在不久的将来，向美帝国主义、日本反动派和日共修正主义集团造反的烈火，会烧遍日本全岛。
