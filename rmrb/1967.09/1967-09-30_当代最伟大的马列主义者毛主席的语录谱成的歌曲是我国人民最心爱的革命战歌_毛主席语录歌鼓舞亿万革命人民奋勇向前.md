Songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, composed from the sayings of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, have become the most beloved revolutionary battle songs of our people. These songs inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to advance courageously.

In the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, the broad revolutionary masses sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, drawing boundless wisdom and strength from them, and achieving one victory after another.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, songs composed from the sayings of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, have, since their appearance during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, immediately become the most beloved revolutionary battle songs of our hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. They have become the source of wisdom and strength for the revolutionary struggle of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. They educate and inspire people to follow the course charted by the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, to overcome all obstacles and difficulties, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to win victory for the cause of socialism and communism.

The appearance and rapid spread of songs of Chairman Mao's quotations is a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, a manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought taking root in people's hearts, and a significant event in our people's political life.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have come to realize more deeply that Chairman Mao's words are golden, that every sentence is the truth, and that one sentence is worth ten thousand. People have come to understand more deeply that to win victory in the revolutionary struggle, one must, as Comrade Lin Biao has pointed out, "study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." To meet the urgent need of the broad revolutionary masses to study Mao Zedong Thought, one song after another of Chairman Mao's quotations has been born. At present, there are several hundred songs of Chairman Mao's quotations composed by revolutionary music workers, and countless more composed by the masses themselves. Such a large-scale composition activity is unprecedented in the history of the world, both ancient and modern.

As soon as songs of Chairman Mao's quotations appeared, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country. They sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations with their mouths, imprint them in their hearts, and put Chairman Mao's instructions into action. They say, "We love to sing and listen to the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations the most. When we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we think of Chairman Mao; when we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we think of Chairman Mao's teachings; when we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, it is as if Chairman Mao is by our side; the more we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, the more our hearts burn red and our fighting spirit soars."

The mighty songs of Chairman Mao's quotations are the battle songs of the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary young people sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "The principles of Marxism are numerous, but boiled down to one sentence, it is: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, and we do socialism." And "Revolution is not like inviting people to dinner, writing an essay, painting a picture, or embroidering flowers; it cannot be so gentle, so leisurely, so polite, so yielding. Revolution is an uprising, a violent act by one class to overthrow another class." The more they sing, the more vigorous they become, the more determined they are, and the more unyielding they are. They say: When we sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, we feel that our bodies are filled with boundless strength, and we have the firm conviction to overcome all obstacles and strive for victory.

The songs of Chairman Mao's quotations have great power in educating the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xihu Brigade, Qishi Commune, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, have a deep feeling about this. Some of them, for a period of time, were influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line and adopted the wrong practice of "opposing whoever is in power." Later, after learning and singing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, such as "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary ...", and "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party; all levels of leadership must pay full attention to them and must not be careless," they realized that this practice did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings and corrected it resolutely.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, loves to sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations the most in the troops carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks. In the current struggle to criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, the officers and soldiers repeatedly chant the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, such as "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. Whatever is reactionary, if you do not beat it, it will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." And "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and snakes, must be criticized and must not be allowed to spread freely." This arouses the hatred of all officers and soldiers against the Chinese Khrushchev, and they are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, so that he will never be able to rise again.

In the face of the anti-China reverse current launched jointly by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, the overseas Chinese residing in the Soviet Union, Mongolia, India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries, and the students and personnel stationed abroad from our country who are studying and working in these countries, have written moving chapters in their heroic and tenacious struggle against the treacherous and brutal enemies. The songs of Chairman Mao's quotations are also an extremely powerful spiritual force that inspires them to charge forward and fight.

At present, the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations have become a powerful weapon for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in our country to closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, to achieve great unity, and to launch a great criticism against the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In recent days, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in various parts of the country have, based on Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions," broken down petty-bourgeois factionalism and established proletarian party spirit. The fighters of revolutionary mass organizations in various places sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, such as "We all come from the four seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they have united, thereby powerfully promoting the current great criticism to surge forward.

Comrade Lin Biao has said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, and a correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." Now, studying Mao Zedong Thought and propagating Mao Zedong Thought have become the conscious actions of our hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. Singing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations is a form of studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought that is deeply welcomed by the people. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals sing the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations thousands and tens of thousands of times, the more they sing, the more they love to sing, the more they sing, the redder their hearts become, and the brighter their eyes become. Let the people of our country sing loudly! Let the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought spread more widely with the songs! Let the people of our country, under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, fight more firmly and bravely to sweep away all harmful insects and to turn our country into a vast school of red Mao Zedong Thought!

    当代最伟大的马列主义者毛主席的语录谱成的歌曲是我国人民最心爱的革命战歌
    毛主席语录歌鼓舞亿万革命人民奋勇向前
    广大革命群众在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争中，在同帝修反斗争中，高唱毛主席语录歌，从中吸取了无穷的智慧和力量，取得了一个又一个的胜利
    据新华社二十九日讯　用当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的语录谱成的歌曲，在无产阶级文化大革命中一经出现，就立即成为我国亿万革命人民最心爱的革命战歌，成为亿万革命人民进行革命斗争的智慧和力量的源泉。它教育和鼓舞人们沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向，踏平险阻，排除万难，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为夺取社会主义和共产主义事业的胜利，而奋勇向前。
    毛主席语录歌的出现和迅速普及，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一个胜利，是毛泽东思想深入人心的表现，是我国人民政治生活中一个有重大意义的大事。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万革命人民越来越深刻地认识到：毛主席的话，句句闪金光，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。人们越来越深刻地懂得：要夺取革命斗争的胜利，就得象林彪同志指示的那样：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”为了适应广大革命人民学习毛泽东思想的迫切需要，一首又一首的毛主席语录歌诞生了。目前由广大革命音乐工作者谱曲的毛主席语录歌就有好几百首，由群众自己谱曲的更不计其数。象这样大规模谱曲活动，也是古今中外历史上所没有的。
    毛主席语录歌一经出现，立即受到我国广大工农兵群众、红卫兵革命小将、革命干部和革命知识分子的热烈欢迎。他们把毛主席语录歌唱在口上，印在心上，把毛主席的指示落实在行动上。他们说，毛主席语录歌我们最爱唱，最爱听。唱起毛主席语录歌，就想起毛主席；唱起毛主席语录歌，就想起毛主席的教导；唱起毛主席语录歌，就好象毛主席在我们身边；越唱毛主席语录歌，就越是心红眼亮，斗志昂扬。
    威力无穷的毛主席语录歌，是我国广大无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的战歌。革命小将们一遍又一遍齐声高唱毛主席语录歌：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”和“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”他们越唱越有劲，越唱越坚定，坚强不屈。他们说：我们一唱毛主席语录歌，就觉得全身充满着无穷的力量，就有了排除一切阻力去争取胜利的坚定信念。
    毛主席语录歌对于教育无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众牢牢掌握斗争大方向有巨大威力。浙江省嘉兴县栖真公社西湖大队的贫下中农社员有着深切的感受。他们中间的一些人，有个时期由于受资产阶级反动路线的影响，曾经出现“见当权派就反”的错误做法。后来，他们学唱“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派……”和“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”等毛主席语录歌后，发现这种做法不符合毛主席的教导，就坚决改正。
    无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的中国人民解放军，在担负着“三支”“两军”任务的部队中，最爱唱的是毛主席语录歌。在当前批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的斗争中，指战员们反复诵唱“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”和“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”等毛主席语录歌，激起了全体指战员对中国的赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，他们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，彻底批深批透批倒批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。
    在帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派联合掀起的反华逆流中，香港、澳门的爱国同胞，居住在苏联、蒙古、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国家的华侨和在这些国家学习、工作的我国留学生和驻外工作人员，同阴险、残暴的敌人进行英勇顽强的斗争中，毛主席语录歌同样是鼓舞他们去冲锋、去战斗的无比强大的精神力量，写下了可歌可泣的动人篇章。
    在当前，毛主席语录歌，已成为我国广大无产阶级革命派，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，实行革命大联合，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开革命大批判的有力武器。连日来，全国各地的无产阶级革命派，根据毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”的最新指示，大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性。各地革命群众组织的战士，高唱“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”等毛主席语录歌，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合起来，从而有力地推动了当前的革命大批判汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    林彪同志说过：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”现在，学习毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想，已经成为我国亿万革命人民的自觉行动。大唱毛主席语录歌，正是一种深受群众欢迎的学习和宣传毛泽东思想的好形式。广大工农兵群众、红卫兵革命小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，千遍万遍地高唱毛主席语录歌，越唱越爱唱，越唱心越红，越唱眼越亮。让我国亿万人民放声歌唱吧！让光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，随着歌声更广泛地传播！让我国人民在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，更加坚定、更加勇敢地为扫除一切害人虫，为把我国变成一所红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校而英勇斗争！
