The publication of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Arabic in the Syrian capital, Damascus, has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses.

The publisher wrote on the back cover that Chairman Mao, from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism, correctly analyzed the world situation and pointed out that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that the people will win victory. The Arab people are waging a struggle against imperialism and Israel. Chairman Mao's teachings have strengthened our confidence.

An Arab friend named Mustafa told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that the only path for the Arab people to achieve liberation is the path of people's war pointed out by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong Thought is the most important and powerful weapon for the Arab people and the people of the world. This is the most important support that the Chinese people have given to the people of the world.

He said that after the U.S. imperialists and Israel launched an aggressive war against the Arab countries, the Arab people have seen more clearly who their enemies are and who their friends are; who are their true friends and who, while claiming to be friends, actually stand on the side of U.S. imperialism and Israel, betraying the Arab people. He pointed out that it is very clear that the Chinese people are the most sincere friends of the Arab people.

The first volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Arabic was published in Syria in 1958 and reprinted in 1965. The fourth volume was published in Lebanon in 1965.

The Arabic translations of two brilliant works, "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" and "On Protracted War," from the second volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," have also been published successively in Damascus and have been warmly welcomed by the Syrian people.

On the back cover of the Arabic translation of "On Protracted War," there is a quotation from Chairman Mao: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive."

Since the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, Israel, launched an aggressive war against the Arab countries, the broad masses of the Syrian people have been even more eager to study Chairman Mao's great works on people's war. An Arab friend said that the current situation in the Arab countries is very similar to the situation analyzed by Chairman Mao in his brilliant works. Chairman Mao has pointed out to the Arab people the only correct path to victory.

　　传播毛泽东思想是对世界革命人民最大的支持
    《毛泽东选集》第三卷阿文版在叙利亚出版
    新华社大马士革五日电　《毛泽东选集》第三卷阿拉伯文版最近在叙利亚首都大马士革出版，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    出版者在封底上写道，毛主席以马克思列宁主义的观点正确地分析了世界形势，并且指出了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，人民将赢得胜利。阿拉伯人民正在进行反对帝国主义和以色列的斗争。毛主席的教导增强了我们的信心。
      一位名叫穆斯塔法的阿拉伯朋友对新华社记者说，阿拉伯人民要解放，只有一条道路，即毛泽东指出的人民战争的道路。毛泽东思想是阿拉伯人民和世界人民最重要和最强大的武器。这是中国人民对世界人民最重要的支持。
    他说，美帝国主义和以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争后，阿拉伯人民更加认清了谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友；谁是他们的真朋友，谁是自称为朋友而实际上却站在美帝国主义和以色列一边，出卖阿拉伯人民。他指出，很清楚，中国人民是阿拉伯人民的最真诚的朋友。
    《毛泽东选集》第一卷阿拉伯文版一九五八年在叙利亚出版，一九六五年再版。《毛泽东选集》第四卷阿拉伯文版一九六五年在黎巴嫩出版。
    《毛泽东选集》第二卷中的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》和《论持久战》这两篇光辉著作的阿拉伯文译本最近也相继在大马士革出版，受到叙利亚人民的热烈欢迎。
    在《论持久战》阿拉伯文译本的封底上印着毛主席的语录：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”
    自从美帝国主义及其走狗以色列发动对阿拉伯国家的侵略战争以后，叙利亚广大人民更加迫切地要求学习毛主席关于人民战争的伟大著作。一位阿拉伯朋友说，阿拉伯国家目前的形势，很象毛主席在他的光辉著作中所分析的情况。毛主席向阿拉伯人民指出了取得胜利的唯一正确的道路。
