Japanese mass organizations' leaders strongly condemn Sato's conspiracy activities in Taiwan
Japanese people will not allow the Sato government to be hostile to China
Firmly demand friendship with China, oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to create "two Chinas"

	New China News Agency, September 8th: According to the Oriental News Agency, leaders of Japanese farmers' and youth organizations issued statements on the 6th, strongly condemning Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku for acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism and colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan.

	The chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, Yasahita Masakazu, said, "Sato Eisaku's visit to Taiwan before going to the United States and his conspiracy activities in Southeast Asia only show that he wants to better serve U.S. imperialism's war and aggression policies and more blatantly participate in the U.S.-Soviet joint anti-China policy."

	He pointed out that Sato's actions will drive Japan towards militarism, intensify anti-China activities, and sabotage Sino-Japanese relations. The broad masses of the Japanese people must resolutely oppose Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan, as it harms the interests of the Japanese people.

	The head of the Social Department of the Japan Youth Federation, Mizuno Kichiro, emphasized, "At a time when U.S. imperialism is plotting to expand the war in Vietnam and provoke war against China, Sato's visit to Taiwan is a very serious matter. Obviously, its purpose is to collude with Chiang Kai-shek to participate in the U.S. 'containment' of China, attempting to create a grand conspiracy of 'two Chinas.'"

	Mizuno said, "Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Based on the view that Japan-China friendship is the pillar of Asian peace, we have consistently fought against the 'two Chinas' conspiracy and for the restoration of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Sato's 'visit' to Taiwan and his subsequent 'visits' to Southeast Asia and other anti-communist countries and regions are contrary to these wishes. This is to further advance anti-communist and anti-China activities under U.S. protection."

	Some people in Niigata Prefecture who advocate genuine Japan-China friendship, Yagi Ichiro, Sugita, and Onodera Sadao, strongly condemned Sato Eisaku for ignoring the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people and engaging in conspiracy activities in Taiwan. They pointed out that Sato's trip to Taiwan is part of the international imperialist and revisionist joint anti-China efforts and is another serious step in the Sato government's consistent policy of following U.S. imperialism's 'containment' of China.

	Yagi and others said, "Sato personally going to Taiwan to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been spat upon by the Chinese people, is a blatant act of hostility towards China and is absolutely intolerable."

	According to the New China News Agency, September 7th: According to the Oriental News Agency, the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held a national council meeting from the 2nd to the 3rd in Tokyo, deciding to launch a broad struggle to oppose U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government's intensified anti-China policy, and strongly oppose Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's activities in South Vietnam and Taiwan, which is under the control of the Chiang clique.

	The council, in its resolution, called on the broad masses of the Japanese people to struggle to smash the anti-China policies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

	The council also decided to hold a "Japan-China Friendship Month" in October and November, to widely study Mao Zedong Thought and documents related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and to engage in various forms of struggle against the Sato reactionary government.

　　日本群众团体负责人强烈谴责佐藤去台湾进行阴谋活动
　　日本人民绝不容许佐藤政府敌视中国
　　坚决要求同中国友好　反对美日反动派制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本农民团体、青年团体的负责人六日发表谈话，强烈谴责日本首相佐藤荣作充当美帝走卒去台湾同蒋介石匪帮进行勾结。
    全日本农民协会联合会会长八百板正说，佐藤荣作在访美前去台湾以及东南亚一些国家和地区进行阴谋活动，“只能说明他要更好地为美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策效劳，更加露骨地参加到美苏联合反华政策中去”。
    他指出，佐藤的这一行动将促进日本走向军国主义，加紧反华活动，破坏日中关系。广大的日本人民必须坚决反对佐藤荣作的“访问”台湾的活动，因为它是损害日本人民利益的。
    日本青年团体协议会社会部部长水野光四郎强调说：“正当美帝国主义阴谋扩大侵越战争，对中国进行战争挑衅的时候，佐藤去台湾是一个很严重的事件，很明显，其目的是要同蒋介石勾结，参与美国‘遏制’中国的活动，企图制造‘两个中国’的大阴谋。”
    水野说：“台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。我们根据日本和中国友好是亚洲和平的支柱这一观点，一贯为反对‘两个中国’阴谋、为恢复同中华人民共和国的邦交而斗争。佐藤这次‘访问’台湾及其以后‘访问’东南亚一系列反共国家和地区，是背离我们这些愿望的。这是在美国庇护下进一步推进反共反华的活动。”
    新澙县的一些主张真正日中友好的人士八木一郎、杉田和小野寺定雄，强烈谴责佐藤荣作不顾广大日本人民的坚决反对，在台湾进行阴谋活动。他们指出，佐藤到台湾去是国际上帝修反联合反华的一个组成部分，也是佐藤政府一贯追随美帝国主义“遏制”中国政策的又一严重步骤。
    八木等人说，佐藤亲自跑到台湾，同早已被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石集团进行勾结，这是敌视中国的露骨表现，因而是绝对不能容忍的。
    据新华社七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）总部于二日到三日在东京召开全国理事会会议，决定开展广泛的斗争，反对美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府加紧推行反华政策，并且强烈反对日本首相佐藤荣作去南越和蒋匪帮盘踞的台湾活动。
    理事会在通过的决议中号召广大的日本人民进行斗争，以粉碎美日反动派敌视中国的政策。
    理事会还决定在十月和十一月举行“日中友好月”，普遍地学习毛泽东思想和有关中国无产阶级文化大革命的文件，并同佐藤反动政府进行各种形式的斗争。
