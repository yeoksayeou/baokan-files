The production situation at Wuping Coal Mine is excellent. From January to August, the raw coal production exceeded the plan by 13.5 percent.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 30th: The revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of Wuping Coal Mine in Shandong Province have resolutely responded to the great call of Chairman Mao, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production, making the entire mine's revolution and production flourish.

Currently, the mine has achieved a revolutionary great alliance with the East Is Red Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters as its core. Revolutionary workers have launched a new high tide of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, represented by China's Khrushchev. In terms of production, the command channels are smooth, and the production order is well-maintained. From January to August 25th, the completed raw coal production exceeded the state plan by 13.5 percent, the total tunneling length exceeded the state plan by 12.7 percent, the overall efficiency increased by 10 percent, the cost was reduced by 5.4 percent, and the quality of raw coal has significantly improved. The proletarian revolutionary faction of this mine believes that holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," adhering to part-time revolution, adhering to the eight-hour work system, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, correctly treating the deceived masses, and boldly using revolutionary cadres are the fundamental guarantees and important experiences for achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines at Wuping Coal Mine is extremely sharp and complex. A handful of power-holders within the mine party committee who are taking the capitalist road have long been frantically opposing Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They actively peddle the black goods of China's Khrushchev, promoting material incentives and profit-seeking in the enterprise, using every means to corrupt the soul of the working class, attempting to lead Wuping Coal Mine down the road of capitalist restoration. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they used various political and economic means to manipulate some mass organizations, resist the genuine revolutionary faction, and create obstacles for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Faced with such a serious task of struggle and a complex class struggle situation, the proletarian revolutionary faction, with the East Is Red Revolutionary Fighters as its core, always remembers Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production." On the one hand, they firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle at China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the mine party committee who are taking the capitalist road. On the other hand, they insist on going down the mine and adhering to the eight-hour work system and part-time revolution, no matter what situation they encounter. They regard the completion and overfulfillment of the state's coal production plan as an extremely important aspect of carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well.

After the publication of the letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the broad revolutionary workers on the coal industry front, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers to "grasp revolution, promote production" has been further aroused. Everyone expressed that they must firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production to strive for the overfulfillment of the annual production plan.

　　五井煤矿生产形势大好
    一月到八月原煤产量超过计划百分之十三点五
    据新华社济南三十日电　山东省五井煤矿的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全矿的革命和生产出现了一片欣欣向荣的大好形势。
    目前，全矿已经实现了以东方红革命造反总部这个革命组织为核心的革命的大联合。广大革命职工掀起了对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争的新高潮。在生产方面，指挥渠道畅通，生产秩序井然。从今年一月到八月二十五日止，完成的原煤产量超过国家计划百分之十三点五，掘进总进尺超过国家计划百分之十二点七，全员效率提高百分之十，成本降低百分之五点四，原煤质量大有提高。这个矿的无产阶级革命派认为，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持业余闹革命，坚持八小时工作制，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，大胆使用革命干部，这是取得革命、生产双胜利的根本保证和重要经验。
    五井煤矿两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分尖锐、复杂。矿党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来，猖狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们积极贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，在企业中大搞物质刺激，利润挂帅，千方百计地腐蚀工人阶级的灵魂，企图把五井煤矿引向资本主义复辟的道路。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，他们又利用各种政治手段和经济手段，操纵一些群众组织，对抗真正的革命派，为无产阶级文化大革命制造障碍。
    面临这样严重的斗争任务和复杂的阶级斗争局面，以东方红革命战士为核心的无产阶级革命派，始终牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，一方面，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，对准矿党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；另一方面，他们无论遇到什么情况，都坚持下井，坚持八小时工作制，坚持业余闹革命。他们把完成和超额完成国家的煤炭生产计划，看成是搞好无产阶级文化大革命的一个极为重要的方面。
    毛主席和党中央给煤炭工业战线广大革命职工的信发表以后，更加激起了广大革命职工“抓革命，促生产”的积极性。大家表示：一定要狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取超额完成全年生产计划。
