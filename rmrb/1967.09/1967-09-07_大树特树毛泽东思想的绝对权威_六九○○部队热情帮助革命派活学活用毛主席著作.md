In the movement to support the army and love the people, the People's Liberation Army's 69000 Unit has been fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses of Changsha, Hunan. They share the revolutionary masses' joys and sorrows, and help them establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary masses trust them more, love them more, and rely on them more. The military and the people are united as one, inseparable.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers in this unit have deeply realized through struggle that to firmly support the revolutionary masses, one must humbly learn from the revolutionary masses' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For this purpose, the soldiers and officers often hold discussions and banquets with revolutionary comrades from the "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder," invite them to give reports, and together criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan. In the course of joint struggle, they have established deep class feelings with the revolutionary comrades. Soldiers and officers executing the "support left" mission in a certain factory in Changsha listened to the stories of their comrades from the "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" who, under the brutal persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, remained unyielding and continued to struggle. This further strengthened their resolve to support the leftists. The soldiers and officers declared: "Our heads may be chopped off, our blood may flow, but Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must not be abandoned." In the "support left" work, no matter how great the difficulties, they must unite with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fight together, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a thorough conclusion.

At the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, the soldiers and officers firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, clearly supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and greatly dampening the arrogance of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Therefore, this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are terrified and enraged by this unit, heaping many accusations on them. The soldiers and officers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "whatever the enemy opposes, we support," fearlessly face slander and libel, and use a wealth of facts to refute the slanders of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road against the revolutionary organizations "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder." They resolutely stand as their strong rear guard. The 9th Company of a certain unit, while protecting Changsha's Xi River Shipyard and Changsha Textile Factory, faced threats from conservative organizations. The officers and soldiers did not retreat. They insisted on propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, exposed the plots of the class enemies, won over and educated the deceived masses, and protected the broad revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses excitedly said: "With Chairman Mao backing us up and the People's Liberation Army as our rear guard, we will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!"

The soldiers and officers warmly care for the political growth and progress of the proletarian revolutionary masses, helping them establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, strengthen their Party spirit, discard factionalism, see the big picture, and consider the overall situation, concentrating the struggle on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. When there are some disagreements among the revolutionary mass organizations, the soldiers and officers study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" together with the revolutionary comrades. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." "All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

Comrades from the "Changsha Workers' Union" and "Xiangjiang Thunder" said: Only by uniting can we concentrate our firepower to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters and completely expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically. In the future, we proletarian revolutionary masses must unite more closely, fight more bravely together, and achieve more glorious victories together, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

　　大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    六九○○部队热情帮助革命派活学活用毛主席著作
    据新华社长沙五日电  在拥军爱民运动中，人民解放军六九○○部队同湖南长沙的无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，爱革命派所爱，急革命派所急，帮助革命派树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，广大革命派更加信任他们，热爱他们，依靠他们，军民之间团结一心，亲密无间。
    这个部队的广大指战员在斗争实践中深刻地认识到：要坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，就必须虚心学习革命派无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。为此，指战员们经常和“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等无产阶级革命派战友一起座谈、联欢，请他们作报告，和他们一起批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南地区的代理人，在共同的战斗中和革命派战友建立了深厚的阶级感情。在长沙某厂执行支左任务的指战员听了“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等战友们在资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害下，不屈不挠，坚持斗争的事迹，更加坚定了他们支持左派的决心。指战员们表示：头可断，血可流，毛主席的革命路线不可丢。在支左工作中，不管遇到多大困难，我们都要和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把无产阶级文化大革命搞深、搞透、搞彻底。
    指战员们在两条路线斗争的关键时刻，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，旗帜鲜明地支持无产阶级革命派，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风。因此，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派对这支部队怕得要死，恨得要命，给他们添加了许多罪名。指战员们遵照毛主席“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”的教导，不怕围攻谩骂，不怕造谣中伤，用大量的事实驳斥了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”等革命组织的诬蔑，坚决做他们的坚强后盾。某部九连在保护长沙河西船舶厂和长沙纺织厂时，面对保守组织的威胁，干部战士毫不退缩，他们坚持宣传毛主席的革命路线，揭露了阶级敌人的阴谋，争取教育了受蒙蔽群众，保护了广大革命群众。广大革命群众激动地说：“有毛主席给我们撑腰，有解放军作我们的后盾，我们一定能把文化大革命进行到底！”
    指战员们热情地关怀无产阶级革命派在政治上的成长和进步，帮助他们在头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，增强党性，丢掉派性，识大体，顾大局，把斗争矛头集中在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上。当革命群众组织之间发生一些意见分歧的时候，指战员们就和革命派战友一起学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作。毛主席教导我们：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
  “长沙工联”和“湘江风雷”的战友们说：只有团结起来才能集中火力彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭。今后，我们无产阶级革命派一定要更加紧密地团结在一起，更加勇敢地战斗在一起，更加光荣地胜利在一起，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
