	It is late at night, and the Tanzanian youth Sabri is still engrossed in reading the works of Chairman Mao. He is a driver, and since he obtained the Swahili edition of Chairman Mao's works, people often see him studying while sitting in the car during the day and under the lamp at night.

	He said: "After studying Chairman Mao's works, I have understood two things: first, how to distinguish between friends and enemies, and second, how revolutionary youth should work and live."

	He said: "There are two suns in the world, one is the sun in nature, and the other is the sun in the hearts of the people of the world—Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao's words are all truths. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates China but also illuminates the world. Revolutionary people all over the world are studying Chairman Mao's works and seeking revolutionary truth from them. There is no doubt that as long as the revolutionary people of the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought, their work will have a direction. Their revolutionary struggle will definitely achieve victory."

    夜深了，他还在学习
    夜深了，坦桑尼亚青年萨布里还在聚精会神地阅读毛主席的著作。他是一位汽车司机，自从他得到斯瓦希里文的毛主席著作之后，人们经常看见他白天坐在车上学习，晚上坐在灯下学习。
    他说：“我学了毛主席著作后，懂得了两个问题：第一是要分清敌友，第二是革命青年应如何工作和生活。”
    他说：“世界上有两个太阳，一个是自然界的太阳，一个是世界人民心中的太阳——毛泽东。毛主席的话句句是真理。毛泽东思想的光辉不仅照亮了中国，而且照亮了世界。全世界革命人民都在学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中寻求革命真理。毫无疑问，世界革命人民只要掌握了毛泽东思想，他们的工作就有了方向。他们的革命斗争就一定能取得胜利。”
