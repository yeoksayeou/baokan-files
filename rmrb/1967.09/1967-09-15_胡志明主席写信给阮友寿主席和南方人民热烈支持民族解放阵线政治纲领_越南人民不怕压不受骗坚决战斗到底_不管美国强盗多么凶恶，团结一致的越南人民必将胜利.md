To Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to the members of the Central Committee:

Dear Comrade Chairman and members of the Central Committee:

Dear compatriots, soldiers, and cadres of the South:

At a time when our military and people in both the North and the South are achieving continuous glorious victories in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has published its political program. This is a program of great national unity, a program determined to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their puppet traitor clique.

For seven years, our heroic compatriots and soldiers in the South, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front, have been closely united and bravely fighting, smashing all the enemy's plans of aggression. More than a million American troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops have suffered heavy blows. The American aggressors are suffering defeats and are in a desperate situation. The military and people of the South are advancing from victory to victory, launching frequent attacks against the enemy from all sides. These glorious victories have further consolidated and enhanced the prestige of the National Liberation Front, the sole true representative of the South Vietnamese people, both at home and abroad. We Vietnamese people, our beloved country of Vietnam, are immensely proud of the iron wall of our heroic South.

The American aggressors, mired in the South, are frantically expanding the war in the South and escalating their destructive war against the North. At the same time, they are shouting deceitful slogans of peace. However, bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land.

Unity is our invincible strength. The political program of the National Liberation Front is the banner of great unity of all the people of the South in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, until final victory. Our people, who are already united, must further broaden and strengthen our unity! We must further broaden and strengthen our unity with our brothers and friends around the world who are strongly supporting us, including the progressive people of America. No matter how ferocious the American aggressors are, our great united strength will surely defeat them.

Our compatriots, soldiers, and cadres in the South are closely united, heroic beyond measure, and have achieved great victories. Today, all the people of the South are of one heart and mind, further strengthening our unity, further fully implementing the correct political program of the National Liberation Front, further displaying our heroic spirit, and we will surely complete the cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and achieving the peaceful reunification of our country.

The seventeen million people of the North are determined to defeat the American aggressors, vigorously launching production and combat competitions, fulfilling our sacred duty to our beloved South!

We have the invincible strength of great unity and will surely emerge victorious!

On the day of national reunification,
The North and South will joyfully reunite!

On this occasion, I send my warmest kisses to the elders, mothers of soldiers, cadres, soldiers, heroes, and brave fighters who have defeated the Americans, as well as to the youth and children.

I extend my heartfelt greetings of victory to Comrade Chairman and the members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!

Ho Chi Minh
Hanoi, September 6, 1967

    胡志明主席写信给阮友寿主席和南方人民热烈支持民族解放阵线政治纲领
    越南人民不怕压不受骗坚决战斗到底
    不管美国强盗多么凶恶，团结一致的越南人民必将胜利
    新华社河内十四日电　据这里报纸报道：越南民主共和国主席胡志明，六日写信给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿、各中央委员和越南南方人民，热烈支持越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领。胡志明主席在信里表示：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”信件全文如下：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主
  席阮友寿律师和各位中央委员：亲爱的主席同志和各位委员：亲爱的南方同胞、战士和干部：
    正当我国南北两方军民在抗美救国事业中接连取得许多辉煌胜利的时候，越南南方民族解放阵线公布了政治纲领。这是全民大团结的纲领，是决心彻底战胜美国强盗及其卖国走狗集团的纲领。
    七年来，英雄的南方同胞和战士在民族解放阵线的英明领导下，紧密团结，勇敢战斗，粉碎了敌人的一切侵略计划。一百多万美军、伪军和帮凶军遭到了沉重的打击。美国强盗正在遭到失败，陷于走投无路的处境。南方军民在胜利的基础上，正在从各方面到处频繁进攻敌人。这些辉煌的胜利，使越南南方人民的唯一真正代表——南方民族解放阵线在国内和世界上的威信日益巩固和提高。我们越南民族，我们祖国越南，对祖国的铜墙铁壁——英雄的南方感到无比自豪。
    美国强盗在南方陷入泥沼，便疯狂地扩大南方战争和对北方进行破坏性战争“升级”。同时，它还叫嚷欺诈的和平论调。但是，炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。
    团结是我们的无敌力量。民族解放阵线的政治纲领，是全体南方人民大团结共同抗美救国，直到最后胜利的旗帜。已经团结的我国人民，必须进一步广泛和紧密地团结起来！我们必须进一步广泛和紧密地团结正在大力支持我们的世界上的兄弟和朋友们，包括美国进步人民。不管美国强盗多么凶恶，我们伟大的团结力量必将战胜他们。
    我们南方同胞、战士和干部紧密团结，英雄无比，所以取得了巨大胜利。今天，全体南方人民万众一心，进一步紧密团结，进一步充分实现民族解放阵线正确的政治纲领，进一步发扬英雄气概，就必将胜利地完成解放南方、保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国的事业。
    一千七百万北方同胞决心战胜美国强盗，大力展开生产和战斗竞赛，履行对骨肉南方的神圣义务！
    我们具有大团结的无敌力量，必将取得胜利！
    到了祖国统一之日，
    北南欢聚心情欢畅！
    值此机会，我多多亲吻父老们、战士母亲们、干部和战士们、英雄和歼美勇士们以及青年和儿童们。
    我亲切地向主席同志和南方民族解放阵线各位中央委员，致以决胜的敬意！
                           胡志明　一九六七年九月六日于河内
