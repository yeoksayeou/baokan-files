Currently, many Mao Zedong Thought study groups across Japan are studying the "Old Three Articles." During a recent Mao Zedong Thought study meeting in Nagoya City, a group of revolutionary youth enthusiastically discussed their urgent desire to master the "Old Three Articles."

A young worker named Mutō said: "The 'Old Three Articles' are easy to read, but to truly master them, one must fiercely struggle against the 'old self.' Especially for us living in the capitalist society of Japan, it is very easy to be infected by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, we must use the 'Old Three Articles' as a mirror, constantly examining our own thoughts, continuously waging a struggle in our minds between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies, and resolutely decide to reform our thoughts for a lifetime. Otherwise, we will become corrupt and degenerate like the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party."

Mutō once worked in a large monopoly capital electric company in Japan. He harbors deep hatred for the dark Japanese society. He said: I studied the "Old Three Articles" and began to establish the thought of fearlessly sacrificing for the revolution. Chairman Mao said: "To struggle is to make sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence." However, one must see for whom one dies. If it is for the people's cause, one should exert all efforts to fight against the enemy. In this way, even if one dies, it is a worthy death.

Through the struggles of the Japanese people against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, Japanese Communist Party revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries, one can see that the spirit taught by Chairman Mao in the "Old Three Articles"—completely and thoroughly serving the people, being selfless and dedicated, resolutely deciding to make sacrifices, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory, and daring to uphold the truth and correct errors—is increasingly taking root in the hearts of Japanese revolutionary youth and revolutionary people.

### 一定要把“老三篇”学到手

　　一定要把“老三篇”学到手
    目前，日本各地的许多毛泽东思想学习小组都在学习
  “老三篇”。名古屋市一批革命青年在最近举行的一次毛泽东思想学习会上，纷纷谈到了他们迫切要求把“老三篇”学到手的心情。
    一位名叫武藤的青年工人说：“‘老三篇’容易读，但是要学到手，就得狠斗‘旧我’。特别是我们生活在资本主义社会的日本，很容易受资产阶级思想侵蚀，所以我们要把‘老三篇’作为一面镜子，经常对照自己的思想，不断地在我们的头脑中展开无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的斗争，并且要下定决心，改造一辈子思想，否则就会象日共修正主义分子那样腐化堕落。”
    武藤曾在日本一家大垄断资本的电器公司做工，他对黑暗的日本社会充满着刻骨的仇恨。他说：我学了“老三篇”，开始树立了为革命不怕死的思想。毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。”但是，要看为谁而死。如果是为了人民的事业，就应当竭尽全力同敌人进行斗争，这样，即使死了，也是死得其所。
    通过日本人民反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日共修正主义和反对日本反动派的各种斗争，人们可以看出，毛主席在“老三篇”中所教导的完全彻底地为人民服务，毫不利己专门利人的精神；下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利的精神；勇于坚持真理、修正错误的精神，越来越在日本革命青年和革命人民的心中扎下根子。
