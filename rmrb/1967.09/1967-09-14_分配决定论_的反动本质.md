Between March and April 1957, the Chinese Khrushchev went around advocating the issue of distribution with ulterior motives. He avoided discussing the class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie, instead shouting about how the contradictions among the people were "particularly reflected in the issue of distribution." He also said, "In a socialist society, the contradictions between the production relations and productive forces are mainly reflected in the issue of distribution." "If the production relations are in line with the productive forces, that is, the distribution relations are in line with the productive forces, it will promote the development of productive forces, and everyone will work hard, and labor enthusiasm will be enhanced; if you get more and I get less, everyone will not want to work, and the productive forces will be hindered, and this will be reflected in the issue of distribution."

Here, he completely denies class struggle and regards the issue of distribution as the main contradiction in a socialist society, as the decisive driving force for either promoting or hindering the development of productive forces.

Why did the Chinese Khrushchev emphasize the issue of distribution so much? Everyone knows that in February 1957, Chairman Mao delivered the brilliant speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." In this speech, Chairman Mao creatively proposed that "in a socialist society, the basic contradiction remains that between the production relations and productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base." He also emphasized that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership system, class struggle has not ended. Throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the two classes and two roads. The struggle between the two classes and two roads is the main contradiction in a socialist society, the driving force for the advancement of socialism.

At this time, the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out to talk about the issue of distribution, precisely to sing the opposite tune of Chairman Mao, aiming directly at Chairman Mao's brilliant theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. He replaced class struggle with distribution as the main contradiction in a socialist society, intending to propagate the theory of "extinction of class struggle," attempting to make the masses ignore class struggle, and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev talked about the issue of distribution to oppose the prominence of politics, to advocate material incentives, and to create theoretical grounds for promoting the system of "profit first" and "money first." He maliciously defamed and slandered the working people, saying that in a socialist society, people "all strive to get more distribution, more wages, more housing, ... in short, they just want to get more for themselves." Since people work just to get more, to mobilize people's enthusiasm, there is only the way of material incentives. He explicitly said, "It is not yet time to do without material incentives," "some material incentives are still needed." He advocated using material incentives to mobilize people's enthusiasm, intending to promote bourgeois politics, to corrupt the souls of the working people with the exploitative class ideology of "if you do not seek personal gain, you will be punished by heaven and earth," and to create conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

Here, the Chinese Khrushchev's target is also directly at Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has always taught us to rely on the prominence of politics and the improvement of consciousness to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao once again proposed, "Now we need to strengthen ideological and political work," "without correct political views, it is like having no soul." The Chinese Khrushchev, however, sang the opposite tune at this time, attempting to replace the prominence of politics with "material incentives," and fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought. This is intolerable!

He talked about the issue of distribution to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. He claimed that the main content of the political life of the people in a socialist country is to solve the issue of distribution. He said, "The enthusiasm of the socialist people's democracy" lies in the people "caring about their economic life," "definitely having to discuss wages, housing, eating, and transportation." He absurdly said that only by discussing and solving the issue of distribution does political life have "flavor," "otherwise, holding so many meetings and practicing so much democracy has no flavor." He repeatedly claimed that solving the issue of distribution, organizing social life, and improving material welfare "is the material foundation of socialist democracy," "is the most important task of the socialist state." He even blatantly proposed that the "repressive organs of the state can be reduced," attempting to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, to turn the socialist state into a "state of the whole people," a "welfare state," that is, to turn it into a state of bourgeois dictatorship.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle ultimately boils down to the issue of power. The Chinese Khrushchev openly regarded solving the issue of distribution as the main content of the political life of a socialist state, aiming to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, directly targeting Chairman Mao's great theory on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In fact, regarding the distribution of consumer goods as the decisive factor in socialism is not something new; it is just a stinking version of the old revisionists' "distribution determinism." Marxism has long told us that the distribution of means of production determines the distribution of consumer goods. Who controls the means of production is the decisive issue. However, "distribution determinism" completely reverses this, regarding the distribution of consumer goods as the decisive driving force. Marx had already criticized this fallacy, pointing out that "to regard so-called distribution as the essence of things and to focus on it is fundamentally wrong."

In summary, the Chinese Khrushchev revived the "distribution determinism" that had long been criticized by Marx, precisely to fiercely attack the great Mao Zedong Thought, to cover up the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, to numb the class consciousness of the working class, to oppose political leadership, to promote material incentives, and to build a "welfare state." His ultimate goal is to carry out a peaceful evolution in our country, to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to restore capitalism. The "socialism" he advocates is actually false socialism and true capitalism. We must definitely rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and sweep away the Chinese Khrushchev's "distribution determinism"!

    “分配决定论”的反动本质	经洪琪
    一九五七年三、四月间，中国赫鲁晓夫到处游说，别有用心地大谈特谈分配问题。他闭口不谈工人阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争，而叫嚷什么现在人民内部矛盾“特别表现在分配问题上面”，他又说，“社会主义社会里生产关系与生产力的矛盾主要表现在分配问题上”。“如果生产关系适合生产力，就是说分配关系适合生产力，就要促进生产力的发展，大家就努力干，劳动热情就提高了；你多分了，我少分了，大家不愿意干，生产力就要受到阻碍，在分配问题上表现出来”。
    这里，他完全抹煞阶级斗争，而把分配问题看成是社会主义社会的主要矛盾，看成是促进或者阻碍生产力发展的决定性动力。
    中国赫鲁晓夫如此强调分配问题的原因何在呢？
    大家知道，一九五七年二月毛主席作了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的光辉讲话。在这篇讲话中，毛主席创造性地提出了：“在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。”并强调指出，在所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，阶级斗争并没有结束。在社会主义整个历史时期中，贯穿着无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。两个阶级和两条道路的斗争，是社会主义社会的主要矛盾，是社会主义前进的动力。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在这时候跳出来，大谈特谈分配问题，就是为了同毛主席大唱反调，其矛头就是指向毛主席关于社会主义社会矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的光辉理论。他以分配代替阶级斗争，作为社会主义社会的主要矛盾，就是要宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，妄图使群众忽视阶级斗争，为复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫大谈特谈分配问题，还为了反对突出政治，为宣扬物质刺激，推行利润挂帅、钞票挂帅制造理论根据。他恶毒地丑化和污蔑劳动人民说，在社会主义社会里，人们“都争着要分配得多一点，工资要多拿一点，房子要多住一点，……总之，无非是想自己多分一点。”既然人们都是为了多分一点而干活，那么为了调动人们的积极性，就只有搞物质刺激了。他明白地说：“现在还没有到不要物质刺激的时候”，“物质刺激还是要一点罗”。他鼓吹用物质刺激的办法调动人们的积极性，就是要突出资产阶级政治，用“人不为己，天诛地灭”的剥削阶级思想来腐蚀劳动人民的灵魂，为资本主义复辟创造条件。
    在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫的矛头也是直接指向毛主席的。毛主席一贯教导我们，要靠突出政治提高觉悟的办法来调动人民群众的革命积极性。在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中，毛主席又一次提出：“现在需要加强思想政治工作”，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。中国赫鲁晓夫却在此时大唱反调，妄图用“物质刺激”来代替突出政治，猖狂地反对毛泽东思想。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    他大谈分配问题，也是为了反对无产阶级专政。他宣称社会主义国家人民政治生活的主要内容就是解决分配问题。他说：“社会主义人民民主的积极性”就在于人民“关心自己的经济生活”，“一定要过问工资、住房、吃饭、坐车这些事”。他胡说只有议论和解决分配问题，政治生活才有“味道”，“不然开那么多会，搞那么多民主又有什么味道呢？”他不止一次地宣称：解决分配问题，组织社会生活，搞好物质福利，“就是社会主义民主的物质基础”，就是社会主义“国家最重要的任务”。他甚至明目张胆地提出“国家的专政机构可以缩小”，妄图取消无产阶级专政，把社会主义国家演变为“全民国家”、“福利国家”，即演变为资产阶级专政的国家。
    无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，归根到底仍然是政权问题。中国赫鲁晓夫公然把解决分配问题看作是社会主义国家政治生活的主要内容，其目的就是反对无产阶级专政，矛头正是指向毛主席关于无产阶级专政的伟大学说的。
    其实，把消费品的分配当作社会主义的决定性的东西，并不是什么新鲜玩艺，而是老修正主义者的腐臭不堪的“分配决定论”的翻版。马克思主义早已告诉我们，生产资料的分配决定消费品的分配。生产资料在谁手里，这是决定性的问题。而“分配决定论”却完全本末倒置，把消费品的分配当作决定性的动力。马克思早就痛斥过这种谬论，指出“把所谓分配看做事物的本质并把重点放在它上面，那也是根本错误的。”
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫重新抬出早已被马克思批判得体无完肤的“分配决定论”，就是为了猖狂地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，就是为了掩盖资产阶级对无产阶级进行的阶级斗争，麻痹工人阶级的阶级意识，反对政治挂帅，推行物质刺激，建立“福利国家”。他的最终意图，就是要在我国实行和平演变，颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。他所标榜的“社会主义”，其实不过是假社会主义，真资本主义。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的“分配决定论”！
