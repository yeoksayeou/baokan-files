The Chinese cargo ship "Dawn" triumphantly departed from Genoa after its crew of over twenty days of heroic struggle, thoroughly smashing the anti-China political provocation by the Italian authorities, and completing its unloading. On September 12, the "Dawn" ship, with the sayings of the great leader Chairman Mao prominently displayed, triumphantly sailed out of the port of Genoa.

Before the "Dawn" left the port, Captain Gu Fushan read a statement on the dock, reaffirming the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Italian people and once again protesting against the serious political provocation by the Italian authorities.

On the morning of September 12, the "Dawn" was filled with joy. All the crew members, with the excitement of victory in their struggle, gathered on the deck to bid farewell to the Italian people who had enthusiastically supported their just struggle over the past month. They held high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and vibrant red flags, loudly read the sayings of Chairman Mao, sang revolutionary songs, and shouted slogans of friendship between the Chinese and Italian peoples. Many Italian dock workers and other people on the dock enthusiastically greeted the crew members of the "Dawn."

The deputy representative of the Chinese Commercial Representative Office in Italy, Liu Ruoming, other staff members of the Commercial Representative Office, and representatives of Chinese students in Italy were on the dock to see them off.

As the "Dawn" left the port, it hoisted signal flags and sounded the horn three times to salute the people of Genoa. The tugboats in the harbor also responded to bid farewell to the "Dawn."

The evening before the "Dawn" left the port, a representative of the Genoa Provincial Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) came aboard to warmly bid farewell to the entire crew of the "Dawn" and to pay tribute to the beloved leader Mao Zedong of the world's peoples through them. The representative presented the "Dawn" with a copper sculpture featuring Mao Zedong's portrait, a flying red flag, the "Dawn" ship with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win," and a bouquet symbolizing the flag of the People's Republic of China made up of fifty-six red flowers (representing the fifty-six crew members of the "Dawn") and five yellow flowers (representing the five stars). The crew of the "Dawn" asked him to convey their friendship and gratitude to the Italian working people and presented him with a plaster statue of the great leader Chairman Mao.

In his statement before departure, Captain Gu Fushan recounted the farce of the Italian authorities' unreasonable interference with the "Dawn" crew's study and promotion of Mao Zedong Thought on their own ship after the "Dawn" arrived in Genoa on August 13. He pointed out that this twenty-three-day-long persecution incident is rare in international cargo history. This is an anti-China event deliberately plotted by the Italian authorities in pursuit of American imperialism. The Italian authorities must bear full responsibility for the consequences and compensate for all losses.

Gu Fushan said, "It is the sacred and inviolable right of Chinese sailors to study and promote Mao Zedong Thought on their own ship, which is entirely an internal affair of the Chinese ship, and no one is allowed to interfere in any way." He pointed out that through the resolute struggle of the Chinese crew, the Italian authorities finally had to abandon their unreasonable demand that the "Dawn" remove the sayings of Chairman Mao and lifted the blockade and siege of the "Dawn," which shows that the Italian authorities have admitted their mistake in action. Gu Fushan said, "We hope that the Italian authorities will not do anything else that harms the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, otherwise it will have very serious consequences."

The captain of the "Dawn" said, "During the days of our struggle against persecution, the warm support and sympathy of the Italian working people and people of all walks of life gave us great encouragement." He once again expressed his heartfelt thanks for this support and sympathy, and also thanked those Italian business people for their efforts to resolve the "Dawn" incident and maintain Sino-Italian trade. He finally emphasized, "The friendship between the peoples of China and Italy is unbreakable by anyone."

    颗颗红心向太阳　阵阵凯歌入云霄
    我“黎明”轮胜利驶离热那亚
    意大利工人和群众齐集码头向“黎明”号船员热情告别
    新华社十四日讯　热那亚消息：中国远洋货轮“黎明”号，在它的全体船员进行了二十多天英勇斗争、彻底粉碎了意大利当局反华政治挑衅，在卸货完毕之后，于十二日高悬着伟大领袖毛主席的语录，胜利地驶离热那亚港。在“黎明”号离港以前，船长顾馥山在码头上宣读了一项声明，重申中国人民对意大利人民的友谊，再次抗议意大利当局的严重政治挑衅。
    十二日上午，“黎明”号上喜气洋洋。全体船员怀着斗争胜利的激情，集合在甲板上，向一个月来热烈支持他们正义斗争的意大利人民告别。他们高举伟大领袖毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和鲜艳的红旗，高声朗读毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲，并且高呼中意人民友好的口号。许多意大利码头工人和其他群众在码头上热情地向“黎明”号船员们致意。
    中国驻意大利商务代表处副代表刘若明、商务代表处其他工作人员和中国在意大利的留学生代表在码头上送行。
    “黎明”号在驶离港口时悬挂起信号旗并高鸣汽笛三声，向热那亚人民致意，港内的拖船也回声向“黎明”号告别。
    “黎明”号离港前夕，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）热那亚省委的代表来到船上向“黎明”号全体船员热情地告别，并且通过他们向全世界人民敬爱的领袖毛主席致敬。这位代表送给“黎明”号一块铜雕，上面刻着毛主席头像，飘扬着红旗的“黎明”号船型，中文书写的“毛主席万岁”，“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”的字样，以及用五十六枝红花（代表“黎明”号上五十六名船员）和五枝黄花（代表五颗星）组成的一束象征中华人民共和国国旗的图案。“黎明”号船员请他向意大利劳动人民转达中国海员的友谊和感谢，并且回赠伟大领袖毛主席石膏像一座。
    “黎明”号船长顾馥山在离港前发表的声明中追述了“黎明”号八月十三日到达热那亚后，意大利当局对“黎明”号船员在自己船上学习和宣传毛泽东思想进行无理干涉这一反华丑剧破产的经过。他指出，这一长达二十三天的迫害事件在国际货运史上是罕见的。这是意大利当局追随美帝国主义蓄意策划的反华事件。意大利当局必须对由此造成的后果负全部责任并赔偿一切损失。
    顾馥山说，中国海员在自己船上学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是他们的神圣不可侵犯的权利，完全是中国轮船的内部事务，绝对不容许任何人以任何方式进行干涉。他指出，经过中国船员的坚决斗争，意大利当局最后不得不放弃强要“黎明”号摘除毛主席语录的无理要求，撤销了对“黎明”号的包围和封锁，这说明意大利当局已经在行动上承认了它的错误。顾馥山说，我们希望意大利当局不要再作任何损害中意两国人民友谊的事情，否则将会引起十分严重的后果。
    “黎明”号船长说：“在我们进行反迫害斗争的日子里，意大利劳动人民和各阶层人民对我们的热烈支持和同情，给了我们极大的鼓舞。”他再一次对这种支持和同情表示衷心感谢，并且也感谢那些意大利工商界人士为解决“黎明”号事件和维护中意贸易所作的努力。他最后强调说：“中意两国人民的友谊是任何人都破坏不了的。”
