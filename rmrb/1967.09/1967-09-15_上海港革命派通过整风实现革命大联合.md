    Strengthen Proletarian Party Spirit, Overcome Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism
    Shanghai Port Revolutionary Factions Achieve Great Unity Through Rectification
    Under the assistance of the PLA, by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they launched a fierce attack on the "self" in their minds, eliminated differences, strengthened unity, promoted the great criticism, and advanced production.
    According to a report from our newspaper, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai Port, with the help of the garrison troops in Shanghai, have followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "the necessity to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." During the great criticism of the revolution, they used the method of rectification while fighting, broke down the "self," established the "public," upheld the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, gradually overcame petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, correctly treated themselves, correctly treated the masses, correctly treated brother organizations, achieved great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" throughout the port, pushed the great criticism of the revolution to a new stage, and achieved great victories in both revolution and production.

    Shanghai Port has five port-wide revolutionary mass organizations: the "Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters Port Command Department," the "North China Sea Area Workers' Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters Port Liaison Station," the "Shanghai Port Red Storm Corps," the "Shanghai Port Revolutionary Committee," and the "Rebel Army Shanghai Port Committee." Their general direction is the same. However, due to the sectarianism, cliquism, small-groupism, and anarchism of some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations, mutual opposition was created. When differences arose, they criticized others but not themselves; they exposed others' wounds but not their own souls. Thus, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line could not be well implemented, and the criticism of the capitalist-roaders within the Party could not be deepened.

    To promote revolutionary great unity, the PLA comrades helped the proletarian revolutionary factions to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and achieve ideological revolutionization. Members of various revolutionary mass organizations repeatedly studied the "Three Old Articles" and reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions on some important issues during the Cultural Revolution. They conducted three rectification campaigns.

    During the rectification period, many leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations took Chairman Mao's works as the highest criterion, compared themselves with others, exposed their thoughts, spoke from the heart, and conducted serious self-criticism.

    After the proletarian revolutionary factions in the port won the power seizure struggle, some comrades neglected the transformation of their subjective world, and the ideas of "only I am revolutionary" and "only I am leftist" emerged. The idea of considering oneself a "hero" and the tendency of individualism also grew. For example, in the Port Command Department, some comrades sat in the front row more often when watching performances, sat on the stage more often during meetings, introduced experiences more often, and collected more badges; while they studied less, listened to the masses' opinions less, conducted self-criticism less, and participated in labor less. During the rectification process, they conducted a deep examination and realized that this was the growth of petty-bourgeois ideology within themselves. A standing committee member said excitedly: "The victory of the 'January Revolution' storm of power seizure is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the result of the resolute struggle of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary factions. We absolutely cannot attribute this merit to ourselves and use this victory as our political capital for 'only I am leftist' and 'only I am revolutionary.'" Many comrades recalled that when they were attacked and persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, they first thought of the revolutionary masses and always hoped to obtain the support and help of the revolutionary masses. However, now they think less of their class brothers and first think of themselves, making the circle smaller and smaller, always thinking that without "me," the big affairs of the port cannot be done. The more they thought, the more they felt the harm of petty-bourgeois ideology was great. If they did not revolutionize themselves and resolutely overcome petty-bourgeois ideology, they would not be able to correctly view themselves, correctly treat the masses, or possess thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit; only by daring to "drop one's pants" and bravely "cut off one's tail," not fearing ugliness or pain, could they enhance thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and become true thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

    During the rectification, the comrades in the Port Liaison Station also deeply examined their sectarianism, cliquism, and individualism. A leader said: "With the 'self,' it is empty talk to sincerely achieve revolutionary great unity." Many comrades voluntarily launched a fierce attack on the sectarianism and cliquism in their minds.

    Based on correctly treating themselves, correctly treating the masses, and correctly treating brother organizations, various revolutionary mass organizations eliminated differences, strengthened unity, sought common ground while reserving differences, overcame mutual suspicion and dissatisfaction, unified their thoughts, and promoted revolutionary great unity.

    Through achieving revolutionary great unity, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the port further deepened the great criticism of the revolution. Many comrades proposed during the rectification study: to eliminate the poison of "Self-Cultivation," to make a revolution in the depths of the soul. They said: "Only by constantly attacking bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought can the proletarian state remain unchanging." They started from the class struggle in the port, deeply criticized the reactionary theory of "Self-Cultivation," and criticized the revisionist cadre line. Some who had participated in the work teams also, with personal experience, exposed and criticized the harm of "Self-Cultivation" to them, expressing their determination to stand with the revolutionary rebels and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line.

    To settle accounts with the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Shanghai and to eliminate the poison of revolutionary economism, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the port also, from bottom to top, used symposiums, struggle-criticism meetings, big-character posters, and blackboard newspapers to extensively mobilize the masses and carry out the great criticism of the revolution.

    The great criticism of the revolution, the great unity of the revolution, and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" have powerfully promoted the development of production. Currently, the production situation in Shanghai Port is getting better day by day. The throughput volume completed in the second quarter of the port is 24% higher than that in the first quarter, and 4.4% higher than the same period last year.

### 上海港革命派通过整风实现革命大联合

专栏：无产阶级革命派大联合万岁！

    增强无产阶级的党性　克服小资产阶级的派性
    上海港革命派通过整风实现革命大联合
    在解放军的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，向头脑中的“私”字猛烈开火，相互之间消除了分歧，加强了团结，推动了大批判，促进了生产
    本报讯　上海港的无产阶级革命派，在驻沪部队的帮助下，遵循毛主席关于“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”的教导，在革命的大批判中，运用边战斗、边整风的方法，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，逐步克服了小资产阶级的派性，增强了无产阶级的党性，做到了正确对待自己，正确对待群众，正确对待兄弟组织，实现了全港的革命大联合和革命的“三结合”，把革命的大批判推向了新阶段，革命和生产取得了很大的胜利。
    上海港有“工总司海港指挥部”、“北方海区工人革命造反联合总部海港联络站”、“上海港红色暴动兵团”、“上海港公革会”、“造反军上海港委员会”等五个全港性的革命群众组织。他们的大方向是一致的。但是，由于革命群众组织的一些负责人有山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等小资产阶级思想倾向，造成了相互之间的对立。发生分歧时，只整别人，不整自己；只揭别人疮疤，不触自己灵魂。这样，毛主席的革命路线不能很好贯彻，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判深入不下去。
    为了促进革命的大联合，解放军同志帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，破“私”立“公”，实现思想革命化。各革命群众组织成员反复学习了“老三篇”，还重温了毛主席在文化大革命中对一些重要问题的指示，先后进行了三次整风。
    在整风期间，各革命群众组织的不少负责人以毛主席著作为最高准则，对照自己，看待别人，亮思想，说心里话，进行了认真的自我批评。
    海港无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争取得胜利后，一些同志由于忽视了对主观世界的改造，“唯我独革”、“唯我独左”的思想冒出来了，以“功臣”自居和风头主义思想也滋长了。例如，海港指挥部有些同志中，就产生了看戏坐前排多，开会坐主席台多，介绍经验多，要纪念章多；而学习少了，听群众意见少了，自我批评少了，参加劳动少了等等现象。他们在整风过程中，深刻地进行了检查，认识到这是小资产阶级思想在自己身上滋长。一位常委激动地说：“‘一月革命’风暴夺权的胜利，是毛主席革命路线的胜利，是上海无产阶级革命派坚决斗争的结果，我们绝不能把这个功劳记在自己的头上，把这一胜利作为自己‘唯我独左’‘唯我独革’的政治资本。”许多同志回想到在遭受资产阶级反动路线围攻迫害的时候，首先想到的是革命群众，总希望得到革命群众的支持和帮助。可是，现在对阶级弟兄却想得少了，首先想到的是自己，把圈子越缩越小，总以为海港的大事，少了“我”不行。大家越想越感到小资产阶级思想的危害很大，如果不革自己的命，不坚决克服小资产阶级思想，就不可能正确看待自己，就不可能正确对待群众，就不可能具有无产阶级的彻底革命性；只有敢于“脱裤子”，勇于“割尾巴”，不怕丑，不怕痛，才能增强无产阶级彻底革命性，才能做一个真正的彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    海港联络站的同志在整风中，也深刻地检查了自己的小团体主义、山头主义、个人主义。一位负责人说：“有了‘私’字，要真心实意实现革命的大联合，那是空话。”许多同志自觉地向自己头脑里的山头主义、小团体主义猛烈开火。
    各革命群众组织在正确对待自己、正确对待群众、正确对待兄弟组织的基础上，消除了分歧，加强了团结，求大同，存小异，克服了相互猜疑、互不服气的现象，统一了思想，促进了革命的大联合。
    海港无产阶级革命派通过实现革命大联合，又把革命的大批判不断引向深入。不少同志在整风学习中提出：要肃清《修养》的流毒，在灵魂深处闹革命。他们说：“只有不断地向资产阶级思想进攻，大立毛泽东思想，无产阶级的江山才能永不变色。”他们从港口的阶级斗争的实际出发，深刻地批判了《修养》的反动理论，批判了修正主义的干部路线。有些曾经参加过工作组的同志也以切身体会，揭发批判了《修养》对他们的毒害，表示坚决与革命造反派站在一起，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒。
    为了清算中国的赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人的滔天罪行，并肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，海港无产阶级革命派还从下到上用座谈会、批判斗争会、大字报、黑板报等形式，广泛发动群众，进行革命的大批判。
    革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，有力地推动了生产的发展。目前，上海港生产形势一天比一天好，第二季度全港完成的吞吐量，比第一季度提高百分之二十四，和去年同期相比，提高了百分之四点四。
