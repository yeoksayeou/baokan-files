	Brezhnev Bare-Chestedly Stages a Mad Anti-China Performance,
	Shamelessly Pleading for Chinese Counter-Revolutionary Revisionists

	BEIJING, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- BUDAPEST -- The heads of the Soviet revisionist clique, Brezhnev and Kosygin, recently visited Hungary for four days. During the visit, the traitor Brezhnev went bare-chested, staging a shameless anti-China farce.

	The Soviet revisionist leaders arrived in Hungary on September 6. The next day, Brezhnev, at a so-called "Soviet-Hungarian Friendship Meeting" in Budapest, spewed venomous anti-China rhetoric, maliciously slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and madly attacking the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sounded the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and has been warmly welcomed by revolutionary people all over the world.

	Seeing the Chinese revolutionaries drag out the capitalist-roaders in power, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and bring about their doom, Brezhnev screams and shouts for them, shamelessly pleading for their cause. He openly incites Chinese counter-revolutionary revisionists to struggle desperately, to "find the strength to defend" their counter-revolutionary "achievements," preparing to stage a comeback. This anti-China clown even claims that the criminal acts of Chinese counter-revolutionary revisionists in restoring capitalism are their "great common cause."

	The Hungarian revisionist leader Kadar and his ilk parroted at this meeting, following their master Brezhnev's tune, and also let out a burst of frenzied anti-China howls.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing victoriously with an irresistible momentum, and the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the revolutionary path for the people of the world. The shameful fate of Chinese counter-revolutionary revisionists awaits the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Brezhnev's few desperate and tearful anti-China howls are merely the death throes of their impending doom.

    勃列日涅夫赤膊上阵疯狂反华
    公然为中国的反革命修正主义分子鸣冤叫屈
    新华社十五日讯　布达佩斯消息：苏修集团头目勃列日涅夫和柯西金等，最近到匈牙利进行了四天访问。在访问期间，大叛徒勃列日涅夫赤膊上阵，表演了一场无耻的反华丑剧。
    苏修头目是六日到达匈牙利的。第二天，勃列日涅夫就在布达佩斯举行的所谓“苏匈友好大会”上，大放反华厥词，空前恶毒地诽谤我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，疯狂地攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的丧钟，受到了全世界革命人民的热烈欢呼。
    勃列日涅夫眼看着以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被中国革命群众揪了出来，遭到灭顶之灾，便声嘶力竭地为他们喊冤叫屈。他公然煽动中国的反革命修正主义分子进行垂死挣扎，“找到力量来捍卫”他们的反革命“成果”，准备东山再起。这个反华小丑，还声称把中国反革命修正主义分子复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当看成是他们“共同的伟大事业”。
    匈修头目卡达尔之流在这次会议上鹦鹉学舌，按照他们的主子勃列日涅夫的腔调，也发出了一阵猖狂的反华叫嚣。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在以排山倒海之势胜利前进，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了全世界人民的革命道路。中国反革命修正主义分子的可耻下场，正在等待着苏修叛徒集团。勃列日涅夫几声凄厉，几声抽泣的反华嚎叫，只不过是他们面临坟墓的垂死挣扎而已。
