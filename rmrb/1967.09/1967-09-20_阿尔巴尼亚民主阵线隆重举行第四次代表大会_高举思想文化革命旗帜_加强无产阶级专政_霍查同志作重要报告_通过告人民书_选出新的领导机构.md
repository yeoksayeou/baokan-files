The Albanian Democratic Front held its fourth congress in Tirana from September 14 to 16. The congress was presided over by Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people and chairman of the National Committee of the Democratic Front. Other leaders of the Party of Labor of Albania and the state, including Shehu and List, also attended the congress.

The congress was attended by 800 representatives, including famous patriotic warriors who participated in the national liberation war, advanced figures from the industrial and agricultural production fronts, and active members from various sectors who emerged during the revolutionary movement.

Comrade Hoxha delivered a report titled "On the Role and Tasks of the Democratic Front in the Struggle for the Complete Victory of Socialism in Albania." The congress unanimously adopted this important report and passed a letter to the Albanian people. The congress also elected a new leadership for the National Committee of the Democratic Front, with Comrade Hoxha re-elected as the chairman.

The congress also passed a resolution supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

In his report on September 14, Comrade Hoxha pointed out that this congress was held at a time when the socialist revolution in Albania is being carried out effectively in all fields according to the path set by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor. Throughout the country, remarkable movements and pioneering spirits have emerged, further revolutionizing people's consciousness, worldview, and their lives and work. He said that this unprecedented creativity is the result of the revolutionary people being inspired by revolutionary ideology under the leadership of the Party.

Comrade Hoxha discussed the historic role of the Democratic Front since its establishment in liberating the country, defending national independence, and building socialism. He said that the Democratic Front is still the main political link that unites the people around the Party and the people's government to build socialism and defend the country; it is a major platform for explaining the Party's line to the working class and educating the working class with the Party's line; it is a powerful means of mobilizing the broad masses of workers to actively participate in guiding and solving major social and national issues.

Comrade Hoxha emphasized the need to ensure the leadership role of the Marxist-Leninist party within the Democratic Front and refuted various fallacies of modern revisionists in this regard. Comrade Hoxha said that in our proletarian dictatorship, the only leading force is the Party of Labor. In society, as long as there is class struggle, no individual—much less an organization—can stand above class, above party, outside of politics, and detached from politics. Whether in the national liberation and democratic revolution or in the proletarian revolution and the struggle to build socialism and communism, only the Marxist-Leninist party can lead the state and the people to victory.

When discussing the current tasks of the Democratic Front in implementing the communiqué and resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party, Comrade Hoxha emphasized the role of the Democratic Front in further strengthening proletarian dictatorship and expanding socialist democracy. He said that the current struggle against bureaucracy in Albania is clearing and opening the way for the maximum development of proletarian democracy.

Comrade Hoxha then discussed the current international situation. He exposed the crimes of American imperialism in intensifying external aggression and expansion, and the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist clique in surrendering to American imperialism and restoring capitalism at home. Comrade Hoxha said that the Johnson-Kosygin talks in Glassboro marked a very dangerous new stage in the Soviet-American alliance. However, the revolution is advancing irresistibly. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the peoples of various countries have taken up arms and are fighting bravely. The peoples of various countries have awakened, their political consciousness has been raised, and they have confidence in their strength and in uniting bravely to fight imperialism head-on and defeat it. Their experience in struggle has made them deeply convinced that their common, principal, and most vicious enemy is American imperialism. The Khrushchev revisionists are slaves and allies of imperialism and reaction, and must be ruthlessly exposed and overthrown. No matter how powerful the imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries may seem on the surface, they are rotten and weak in the face of the developing power of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

Comrade Hoxha warmly praised the fighting friendship between Albania and China, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He said that an unbreakable Marxist-Leninist friendship binds the Albanian people, Party, and government with the great People's Republic of China, with the glorious Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong. Our two parties and peoples are maintaining and strengthening this ever-growing friendship. The People's Republic of China is advancing victoriously on the road of revolution and socialist construction. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is unfolding in all-round victory, striking at open and hidden revisionists and all class enemies, further strengthening proletarian dictatorship. No force in the world can stop the 700 million Chinese people from advancing along the road of socialism and communism. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will purge China of the Khrushchev-like elements, turning the imperialists' and modern revisionists' beautiful dreams into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sets a great example for overthrowing the ruling revisionist cliques in the world. People's China will forever be an unshakable bastion of socialism, a powerful base of revolution, and the Communist Party of China will forever be the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Hoxha said, "We are overjoyed to express our heartfelt respect for the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. We are proud to have such a loyal and powerful ally and friend. No matter what storms and tempests come from where, they cannot weaken or damage the unbreakable friendship between our two countries and parties, which is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We feel it is our duty to reaffirm that the ironclad unity of the forces of Marxism-Leninism and all revolutionary forces in the world with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China is an objective necessity of historical significance for the revolution of the peoples of various countries and the fate of the struggle for socialism and freedom."

Comrade Hoxha reiterated in his report that the Albanian people firmly support the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people and the just struggle of the peoples of the Arab countries against American imperialism and its tool, Israel.

Comrade Hoxha exposed the territorial ambitions of the Greek fascist regime. He sternly warned the Greek monarchist fascists: whether in the past or today, Albanians are not to be frightened. The Albanian people and the Party of Labor of Albania are defending the borders and territory of Albania. Whoever dares to touch Albania will have no way back.

Comrade Hoxha's report was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause and cheers.

During this three-day congress, the representatives had a heated discussion on Comrade Hoxha's report. In their speeches, they expressed complete agreement with Comrade Hoxha's report and resolved to further enhance and give full play to the role of the Democratic Front in the future, strengthen the ironclad unity of the people and the Party, raise the banner of the ideological and cultural revolution higher, implement the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, enhance revolutionary vigilance, and be prepared to crush any invasion by external enemies against socialist Albania at any time, defending the victory of the socialist revolution.

Comrade Kadare, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, said in his speech that one of the most important tasks that the Albanian Democratic Front should have contributed to in the past and should contribute to in the future is to oppose the influence of bourgeois and revisionist ideas, feudal patriarchal remnants, backward customs, and religious superstitions, and to fight for the complete liberation of women. He said that the revolutionary flames that have been ignited across the country to carry the socialist revolution to the end will never be extinguished, and the guarantee for this is the Party and the Party's correct line, and the people's ironclad unity with the Party.

Kadare said, "We are aware that we are building socialism under the conditions of being surrounded by imperialism and revisionism, and what kind of savage and brutal enemies we are facing. We are also aware of the tragedy that occurred in the Soviet Union, and we have seen with our own eyes what is happening there today. The ruling revisionist clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, buried the victory fruits of the October Revolution, and pushed the Soviet Union onto the capitalist road. Therefore, we must constantly enhance our revolutionary vigilance to expose and strike at anyone and any tendency that spreads the seeds of revisionism."

Comrade Balluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, said in his speech that the Party and Comrade Hoxha teach us that people with a revolutionary worldview, who are ready to devote themselves to the cause of the motherland and the people at any time, are the decisive factor in determining the fate of socialist construction and victory in war. From this teaching, our Party regards the tempering of people's spirits as the top priority. Today, the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the Albanian people, socialist patriotism, pride in the motherland and the Party of Labor, have become a very powerful force. In the face of this force, imperialists, revisionists, and all kinds of reactionaries will, as before, suffer a shameful defeat.

Balluku strongly condemned the intensifying collusion of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists against the peoples and revolutions of various countries, and strongly condemned the Greek reactionaries' restless movements on the southern border of Albania. Balluku said, "The Albanian people will maintain vigilance with the armed forces and be prepared to crush the enemy's possible invasion with tenfold strength at any time."

The congress passed a resolution on September 15 supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The resolution warmly praised the Vietnamese people's brave struggle against American imperialist aggression and strongly condemned the American imperialists' policy of "escalating" the war and the "peace talks" fraud peddled by the U.S. and Soviet revisionists. The resolution said that the Soviet revisionist leaders have done a great service in promoting the Johnson government's evil "peace talks" plan. These traitors are stabbing a knife into Vietnam and colluding with American imperialism to force the Vietnamese people to sit at the negotiating table and surrender, with the aim of prolonging American rule in Vietnam and turning Vietnam into a base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and all the peoples of Asia.

The resolution pointed out that the congress admires and fully supports the resolute and brave stance of the Vietnamese people, fully supports the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and welcomes the political program recently adopted by the extraordinary congress of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The resolution expressed confidence that no matter how long and arduous the struggle is, and no matter what storms and tempests appear before the Vietnamese people, victory will belong to the heroic Vietnamese, and the American imperialists and their accomplices will be defeated.

The new leadership of the National Committee of the Democratic Front elected by the congress includes Nushi, Peza, Alija, and Bojani, who were elected as vice-chairmen.

Comrade Hoxha delivered the closing speech in the afternoon of September 16. He said: "The Democratic Front should, together with all other mass organizations, further activate and carry forward the revolutionary spirit that is sweeping our country today, so that the entire people—the heroic working class, cooperative farmers, intellectuals, glorious youth, and brave women of our country—will redouble their efforts, initiate creative proposals, and make our country advance with even greater strides, progress in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and people's lives, and make our motherland even stronger and richer."

Comrade Hoxha said: "Under the leadership of the Party of Labor, socialist Albania has been tempered stronger than ever. Like our heroic people, socialist Albania is strong and inviolable. Our Party, with its correct line, its Marxist-Leninist principles, and its brave struggle against the shameless enemies led by American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists and Tito revisionists, has won the support, love, and solidarity of the peoples and revolutionary forces of all countries in the world. Our country has first won the friendship, love, and brotherly support of the 700 million brotherly Chinese people led by the great Marxist-Leninist leader Comrade Mao Zedong."

Comrade Hoxha said: "We must never forget that our enemies, the imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys, regard our republic and our people as a thorn in their eye. Therefore, we must keep our powder dry and enhance our revolutionary vigilance. The resolutions of our congress should help us strengthen our work of defending the motherland, educate the masses with the spirit of socialist patriotism, so that the masses fully realize that the cause of defending the freedom and independence of the motherland is the most sacred cause, and men, women, old, and young should be ready to sacrifice their lives for it at any time."

Comrade Hoxha's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous cheers from the entire audience. The delegates repeatedly stood up, shouting slogans such as "Enver Hoxha!", "Party of Labor!", "Party of Labor! We are always ready!"

    阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线隆重举行第四次代表大会
    高举思想文化革命旗帜　加强无产阶级专政
    霍查同志作重要报告　通过告人民书　选出新的领导机构
    新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会十四日至十六日在地拉那隆重举行。
    这次大会由阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖、民主阵线全国委员会主席霍查同志亲自主持。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和国家其他领导人谢胡、列希等也都出席了大会。
    出席大会的代表，有参加过民族解放战争的著名爱国战士、工农业生产战线上的先进人物以及在革命化运动中涌现出来的各界积极分子等八百人。
    霍查同志在大会上作了《关于民主阵线在争取社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚完全胜利的斗争中的作用和任务》的报告。大会一致通过了这个重要报告，并通过了告阿尔巴尼亚人民书。大会选出了民主阵线全国委员会新的领导机构，霍查同志再次当选为民主阵线全国委员会主席。
    大会还通过一项支持越南人民抗美救国的决议。
    霍查同志十四日在会上作的报告中指出，这次代表大会，是在阿尔巴尼亚社会主义革命正在按照劳动党第五次代表大会所规定的道路，在各个领域里卓有成效地深入开展的时候召开的。全国各地出现了了不起的运动和首创精神，使人们的觉悟和世界观以及他们的生活和工作进一步革命化。他说，这种空前的创造性，是革命的人民在受到革命思想鼓舞的党的领导下发挥出来的。
    霍查同志论述了民主阵线成立以来对解放祖国、保卫民族独立和建设社会主义方面所起的具有历史意义的作用。他说，民主阵线今天仍然是在政治上把人民团结在党和人民政权的周围建设社会主义和保卫祖国的主要环节；是向劳动人民阐明党的路线并以党的路线教育工人阶级的大讲台；是动员广大劳动群众积极参加指导和解决重大的社会和国家问题的强有力的手段。
    霍查同志强调在民主阵线中要确保马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，并且驳斥了现代修正主义者在这方面的种种谬论。霍查同志说，在我国无产阶级专政制度下，唯一的领导力量是劳动党。在社会上，只要还有阶级斗争，任何个人——更不用说组织了——都不能超脱阶级，超脱政党，站在政治以外和脱离政治。不论是在民族解放和民主革命中，还是在无产阶级革命和建设社会主义和共产主义社会的斗争中，只有马克思列宁主义政党才能领导国家和人民走向胜利。
    霍查同志在谈到民主阵线为实现党的第五次代表大会的公报和决议的当前任务时，强调指出民主阵线在进一步加强无产阶级专政和扩大社会主义民主的作用。他说，目前是在阿尔巴尼亚胜利开展的反对官僚主义的斗争，正在为最大限度地发展无产阶级民主扫清和开辟道路。
    霍查同志接着谈到了当前的国际形势。他揭露了美帝国主义加紧对外侵略和扩张的罪行，揭露了苏修叛徒集团对外投降美帝国主义、对内复辟资本主义的罪恶行径。霍查同志说，约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的会谈，标志着苏美联盟进入了一个非常危险的新阶段。但是，革命正在势不可挡地前进。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，各国人民已经拿起武器，进行英勇的斗争。各国人民已经觉醒了，他们的政治觉悟提高了，对自己的力量和团结起来勇敢地同帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争并战胜帝国主义有了信心。斗争的经验使他们深信，他们共同的、主要的和最凶恶的敌人，就是美帝国主义。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是帝国主义和反动派的奴仆和盟友，必须无情地予以揭露和打倒。不管表面上看来多么强大的帝国主义者、修正主义者和一切反动派，在各国人民革命斗争发展的力量面前，都是腐朽的和虚弱的。
    霍查同志热烈赞扬阿中两国的战斗友谊，赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，牢不可破的马克思列宁主义友谊，把阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府同伟大的人民中国，同由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的光荣的中国共产党联结在一起。我们两党和两国人民维护着这种日益增强的友谊。中华人民共和国正在革命和社会主义建设的道路上胜利前进。中国无产阶级文化大革命正在全面胜利中展开，抗击公开或隐藏的修正主义分子，抗击一切阶级敌人，以进一步加强无产阶级专政。世界上没有任何力量能阻挡七亿中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。人民中国将永远是社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒，将永远是革命的强大基地，中国共产党将永远是马克思列宁主义的旗手。
    霍查同志说，我们怀着喜悦的心情，对中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志领导下所取得的伟大胜利，表示衷心的敬意。我们为有这样忠实、强大的盟友和朋友而感到自豪。不管来自那里的惊涛骇浪和风暴，都不能削弱和损害我们两国和两党建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则钢铁般的基础上的牢不可破的友谊。我们认为有责任重申，马克思列宁主义力量和世界上一切革命力量同中国共产党和中华人民共和国的钢铁般的团结，对于各国人民的革命以及争取社会主义和自由的命运来说，是具有历史意义的客观需要。
    霍查同志在报告中重申，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决支持越南人民的解放斗争，支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的正义斗争。
    霍查同志揭露了希腊法西斯当局对阿尔巴尼亚的领土野心。他严正警告希腊保皇法西斯分子：不论是过去还是今天，阿尔巴尼亚人是吓不倒的。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，保卫着阿尔巴尼亚边境和阿尔巴尼亚的领土，谁胆敢碰一下阿尔巴尼亚，就有来无回。
    霍查同志的报告不断为暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声所打断。
    在这次历时三天的大会上，代表们就霍查同志的报告进行了热烈的讨论。他们在发言中表示完全同意霍查同志的报告，决心在今后进一步提高和发挥民主阵线的作用，加强人民和党的钢铁般团结，更高地举起思想文化革命的旗帜，贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议，提高革命警惕性，准备随时粉碎外来敌人对社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的任何侵犯，保卫社会主义革命的胜利果实。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记卡博在发言中指出，阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线过去和现在都应该为之做出巨大贡献的最重要工作之一，就是反对资产阶级和修正主义思想影响、封建家长制残余、落后习俗和宗教迷信，反对与社会主义社会不相容的一切格格不入的东西，并为争取妇女的彻底解放而斗争。他说，为把社会主义革命进行到底而在全国各地燃起的革命烈火，永远不会熄灭，其保证是党和党的正确路线，是人民和党的磐石般的团结。
    卡博说，我们意识到，我们是在帝国主义和修正主义包围的条件下建设社会主义，我们所面临的是何等野蛮和残暴的敌人。我们也意识到在苏联发生的悲剧，我们亲眼看到今天在那里的所作所为。执政的修正主义集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，埋葬了十月革命的胜利果实，把苏联推上了资本主义道路，因此，我们要不断提高我们的革命警惕性，以揭露和打击传播修正主义种子的任何人和任何倾向。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长巴卢库发言说，党和霍查同志教导我们，具有革命的世界观，随时准备献身于祖国和人民事业的人，是决定社会主义建设的命运和在战争中取得胜利的决定性因素，从这一教导出发，我们党把锻炼人的精神作为头等任务。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民的马克思列宁主义思想，社会主义爱国主义，对祖国和对劳动党的自豪感，已经变成了十分强大的力量。在这种力量面前，帝国主义者、修正主义者和形形色色的反动派都将一如既往地遭到可耻的失败。
    巴卢库强烈谴责美帝和苏修加紧勾结反对各国人民和革命，强烈谴责希腊反动派在阿尔巴尼亚南部边境蠢蠢欲动。巴卢库说，阿尔巴尼亚人民将同武装力量一起保持着警惕，准备随时以百倍的力量粉碎敌人的可能的侵略。
    代表大会在十五日通过了支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的决议。决议热烈赞扬越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争，并强烈谴责美帝国主义的战争“升级”政策和美帝、苏修合伙贩卖的“和谈”骗局。决议说，苏修领导人在推行约翰逊政府的罪恶的“和谈”计划中帮了大忙。这些叛徒正把尖刀插向越南，和美帝国主义互相勾结，以强迫越南人民坐到谈判桌旁，强迫越南人民投降，他们的目的是延长美国在越南的统治，把越南变为反对中华人民共和国、反对亚洲所有人民的侵略基地。
    决议指出，大会钦佩并完全支持越南人民坚决和勇敢的立场，完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，欢迎越南南方民族解放阵线最近召开的非常会议所通过的政治纲领。
    决议表示坚信，不管斗争多么长期和艰巨，不管在越南人民面前出现什么样的惊涛骇浪，胜利必将属于英雄的越南，美帝国主义者及其帮凶必败。
    大会新选出的民主阵线全国委员会领导机构成员中，努什、佩扎、阿利雅和波雅尼当选为副主席。
    霍查同志在十六日下午致闭幕词。他说：“民主阵线应该同所有其他群众组织一起，进一步活跃和发扬今天席卷我国的革命精神，以便使全国人民——英雄的工人阶级，合作社农民，人民知识分子，光荣的青年和我国勇敢的妇女加倍努力，发扬创造性的倡议，使我国以更加巨大的步伐向前迈进，使工业、农业、文教、人民生活得到进步，使我们的祖国变得更加强大和更加富裕”。
    霍查同志说：“在劳动党的领导下，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚锤炼得比任何时候都巩固。象我们英雄的人民一样，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚是坚强的和不可侵犯的。我们党以其正确的路线，以其马克思列宁主义的原则立场，以其反对以美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、铁托修正主义者为首的厚颜无耻的敌人的英勇斗争，使我国赢得了全世界各国人民和革命力量的支持、热爱和声援。我国首先赢得了在我国人民的知心朋友、伟大的马克思列宁主义领袖毛泽东同志领导下的七亿兄弟中国人民的友谊、热爱和兄弟般支持”。
    霍查同志说：“我们时刻也不要忘记，我国的敌人帝国主义者、修正主义者及其仆从把我们的共和国、我国人民视为眼中钉。因此，我们必须保持干燥的火药，提高革命警惕。我们代表大会的决议应该有助于我们加强保卫祖国的工作，有助于以社会主义爱国主义精神教育群众，以便使群众充分地意识到保卫祖国自由和独立的事业是最神圣的事业，男女老幼在任何时刻都应该准备为之献出自己的生命”。
    霍查同志的讲话不断为全场暴风雨般的欢呼声所打断，与会代表一再起立，高呼“恩维尔·霍查！”“劳动党！”“劳动党！我们时刻准备着！”等口号。
