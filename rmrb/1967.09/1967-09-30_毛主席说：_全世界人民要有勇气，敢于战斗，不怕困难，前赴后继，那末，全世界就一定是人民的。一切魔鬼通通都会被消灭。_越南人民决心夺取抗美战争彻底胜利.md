Chairman Mao says: “The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance unceasingly. Then, the whole world will certainly belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed.”

The Vietnamese people are determined to achieve a complete victory in the war against American aggression.

In the past year, the heroic Vietnamese people, who have been steadfast in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, have annihilated more of the American aggressors' fighting forces, tied down a large number of American imperialist troops, further disrupted the American imperialists' global counter-revolutionary strategic deployments, and made outstanding contributions to the anti-American struggle of the people of the world.

In South Vietnam, more than a million American, puppet, and mercenary troops are facing annihilation in the vast ocean of the people's war.

Last winter and this spring, the American imperialists exhausted all their efforts to launch the so-called "second dry season offensive," but again suffered a defeat, with 70,000 American troops annihilated. Since the rainy season, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have pressed forward, frequently launching offensive attacks, and continue to annihilate a large number of the enemy's fighting forces.

According to preliminary statistics, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have annihilated a total of 110,000 American aggressors in the first six months of this year alone, exceeding the number of American troops annihilated last year.

In North Vietnam, the American air pirates have also been severely punished. Up to now, the military and civilian people of North Vietnam have shot down more than 2,200 American pirate planes, shattering the myth of American imperialism's "air superiority."

The Vietnamese people's fighting practice has set a brilliant example for the oppressed peoples of the world to dare to struggle and dare to win, and has set a new brilliant example of how to defeat American imperialism through people's war.

The American imperialists, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, have been constantly hatching plots of "bombing to force peace" and "stopping bombing to lure peace." Recently, they have attempted to use the United Nations to intervene in the Vietnamese issue and peddle the "peace talks" scam. However, the Vietnamese people's resolve to resist American aggression and save the nation is unshakable. The recent political program issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam firmly declares that it will carry out the war of resistance against American aggression to a complete victory. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the 31 million Vietnamese people, solemnly declared: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land."

　　毛主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
　　越南人民决心夺取抗美战争彻底胜利
    一年来，坚持抗美救国战争的英雄的越南人民，消灭了更多的美国侵略者的有生力量，拖住了美帝国主义大量的侵略军队，进一步打乱了美帝国主义的全球反革命战略部署，对世界人民的反美斗争作出了卓越的贡献。
    在越南南方，一百多万美军、伪军和帮凶军在南方人民战争的汪洋大海里面临灭顶之灾。
    在去冬今春，美帝国主义费尽九牛二虎之力，发动所谓“第二个旱季攻势”，又遭到了失败，被歼美军达七万人。雨季以来，南越军民乘胜前进，频繁主动出击，继续消灭敌人的大量有生力量。
    据初步统计，南越军民仅在今年头六个月中就总共歼灭美国侵略军十一万人，超过去年全年歼灭美军的数字。
    在越南北方，美国空中强盗也受到了严厉惩罚。到最近为止，越南北方军民共打落美国强盗飞机两千二百多架，粉碎了美帝国主义“空中优势”的神话。
    越南人民的战斗实践，为全世界被压迫人民树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的光辉榜样，树立了一个依靠人民战争可以打败美帝国主义的新的光辉榜样。
    美帝勾结苏修，不断玩弄“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的阴谋。最近又企图利用联合国插手越南问题，推销“和谈”骗局。但是，越南人民抗美救国的决心是不可动摇的。越南南方民族解放阵线最近发表的政治纲领，坚定表示要把抗美救国战争进行到彻底胜利。胡志明主席代表三千一百万越南人民庄严宣布：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”
