Our Embassy Strongly Protests the Mongolian Revisionists' Brazen Sabotage of the Two Countries' Cultural Cooperation Agreement
The Mongolian Revisionists Are the Running Dogs of the Soviet Revisionists

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, ULAANBAATAR, SEPTEMBER 5 — The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia handed a note to the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 5, strongly protesting the brazen sabotage by the Mongolian revisionist authorities of the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Mongolia, their severance of cultural exchanges between the two countries, and their further aggravation of relations between the two countries.

	The note pointed out that on the afternoon of August 21, the Deputy Director of the Third Department of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the Cultural Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, attacking and slandering China for not wanting to develop cultural cooperation between the two countries and for lacking sincerity in cultural cooperation. They brazenly rejected the 1967 implementation plan for the cultural cooperation agreement between the Chinese and Mongolian governments proposed by the Chinese side and unilaterally canceled the negotiations on the 1967 implementation plan for the cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries. This is a blatant act of sabotage by the Mongolian authorities of the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Mongolia, a severance of cultural exchanges between the two countries, and a deliberate attempt to further aggravate relations between the two countries and undermine the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The Chinese Embassy strongly protests this provocative act.

	The note listed facts to refute the slanders of the Mongolian revisionist authorities against China. The note pointed out that the Chinese side had made great efforts to overcome the many obstacles created by the Mongolian side and had made great contributions to promoting friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries. The facts prove that it is not China but the Mongolian revisionist clique that lacks sincerity in cultural cooperation between the two countries!

	The note pointed out that the Mongolian revisionist clique used the incident that occurred in Beijing on August 9 as an excuse to sabotage cultural cooperation relations between the two countries, which in no way reduces their guilt. The Zedenbal revisionist clique has long been following the Soviet revisionist leadership in its frenzied anti-China campaign. The crime of insulting the portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, by the staff of the Mongolian Embassy in China was deliberately planned and instigated by the Zedenbal revisionist clique. Now they have expanded their anti-China campaign to the field of cultural exchanges, which fully exposes the Zedenbal revisionist clique's despicable intention of acting as running dogs for the Soviet revisionist leadership and creating incidents to escalate anti-China sentiments.

	The note finally warned the Mongolian authorities, saying, "You will not have a good end by following the Soviet revisionist leadership in its anti-China campaign. You must bear full responsibility for the sabotage of the cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries and all the serious consequences that follow."

　　我使馆强烈抗议蒙修悍然破坏两国文化合作协定的严重挑衅
　　蒙修是苏修的反华走卒
    新华社乌兰巴托五日电　中国驻蒙古大使馆五日向蒙古外交部递交一份照会，强烈抗议蒙修当局明目张胆破坏中蒙两国文化合作协定，断绝两国的文化往来，进一步恶化两国关系的严重挑衅事件。
    照会指出，八月二十一日下午，蒙古外交部第三司副司长接见中国驻蒙古大使馆文化秘书，攻击和诬蔑中国不愿发展两国文化合作关系，对两国文化合作没有诚意，悍然拒绝中国方面提出的中国政府和蒙古政府文化合作协定一九六七年执行计划，片面取消关于两国文化合作协定一九六七年执行计划的谈判。这是蒙古当局明目张胆地破坏中蒙两国文化合作协定，断绝两国文化往来，蓄意进一步恶化两国关系，破坏两国人民传统友谊的严重挑衅性事件。对此，中国大使馆提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会列举事实，严厉驳斥了蒙修当局对中国的诬蔑。照会指出，中国方面曾作过极大努力，克服过蒙方多次制造的障碍，为增进两国人民的友谊和相互了解作出了巨大贡献。事实证明，对两国文化合作没有诚意的不是中国，而是蒙修集团！
    照会指出，蒙修集团拿八月九日在北京发生的事件为借口，来破坏两国文化合作关系，这丝毫不能减轻他们的罪责。泽登巴尔修正主义集团追随苏修领导集团猖狂反华，由来已久。蒙古驻华使馆工作人员在中国首都侮辱中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像的罪行，正是泽登巴尔修正主义集团有意策划和唆使的。现在又把反华扩大到文化交流方面，这就更加充分暴露了泽登巴尔修正主义集团甘当苏修领导集团的走卒，千方百计制造事端来加剧反华的卑劣企图。
    照会最后正告蒙古当局说，“你们追随苏修领导集团反华决没有好下场，你们必须对破坏两国文化合作协定和由此产生的一切严重后果承担全部责任”。
