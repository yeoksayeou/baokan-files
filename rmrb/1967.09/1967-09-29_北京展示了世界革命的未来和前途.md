Beijing is bathed in the atmosphere of a festival. The streets have been adorned anew, and everywhere there is a scene of boiling and joyous activity. The songs "The East is Red," "The Boat Sails on Because of the Helmsman," and the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations rise and fall, and red flags flutter in the wind. On the streets, processions carrying bright red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and crowds of people gathering flow ceaselessly. Along the broad avenues, people are decorating the streets in a new Chinese style, giving the city a special hue. What does all this signify? It signifies that this is the grand festival of mass democracy that has never been realized in human history up to now. The Chinese people, who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to rebel, are writing their own history and deciding their own future. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing from victory to victory.

At present, a struggle of great importance to China and to the whole world is being waged. This is a struggle between two lines and two destinies, a great showdown between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. From the streets of Beijing, one can foresee the future and prospects of the world revolution.

All over China, the atmosphere is one of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity. The broad masses of the revolutionaries are preparing to welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, especially the lessons of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, which changed color. Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism and, with scientific accuracy, has put forward the brilliant proposition that the whole period of socialism is still one of class struggle and that the question of who will vanquish whom, socialism or capitalism, has not yet been settled. With this brilliant proposition, Chairman Mao has armed the Chinese people and provided them with a powerful ideological weapon to prevent capitalist restoration.

In every period of the Chinese revolution, it is Chairman Mao who has pointed out the way forward. But Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has met with the frantic resistance and opposition of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, the struggle between the two lines has always existed.

The question of seizing power and establishing proletarian dictatorship has been solved by Marxism. But how can the power already seized be consolidated and prevented from being restored to capitalism, and how can the country be prevented from changing color? How can revisionism be opposed and prevented in a country under proletarian dictatorship? Chairman Mao has correctly solved these major problems, which concern not only China but also the future and destiny of the world, both in theory and in practice.

In theory, Chairman Mao has put forward the doctrine that class struggle exists in the period of socialism and has pointed out the necessity of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In practice, Chairman Mao has personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

What I have seen and am seeing in China is scene after scene of stirring and vigorous activity. This is a sharp, serious, and profound class struggle, an unprecedented great revolutionary movement. Hundreds of millions of people have been aroused, and they are fully enjoying great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, exposing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Chinese Communist Party, and criticizing and struggling against them.

At present, the hundreds of millions of people in China are engaged in revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary criticism is a large-scale mass criticism movement aimed at thoroughly criticizing and exposing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their chief, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and at uprooting the poisonous roots of revisionism. In this mass revolutionary criticism movement, the hundreds of millions of people in China are all critics.

To carry the revolutionary criticism to a deeper level and push it forward, the broad revolutionary masses are uniting at an unprecedented pace.

At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is excellent. The masses have been fully aroused. They are engaged in mass revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity. The Communist Party of China has become stronger. The broad masses of Party members have tempered themselves in the storm of class struggle. On the economic front, a new leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has appeared. On the basis of a thorough criticism of bourgeois and feudal art, truly excellent proletarian artistic models have emerged, such as the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the revolutionary modern play "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Shajiabang," and so on. Even more inspiring is the successful explosion of the hydrogen bomb in the field of science and technology.

On the military front, because Mao Zedong Thought is used as the guiding ideology, the political level of the broad masses of soldiers has been raised, and the combat effectiveness of the great People's Liberation Army of China has been enhanced. In the "three supports and two militaries" work, the great People's Liberation Army of China is establishing and will establish new merits.

The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao firmly grasps the process of the Cultural Revolution and guides the movement wisely.

The great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has broken through national boundaries and shaken the whole world. Imperialism and modern revisionism are trembling, and all reactionaries are trembling. The peoples of the world are inspired, and especially the international proletariat, who regard the victory of the Chinese proletariat as their own victory, are laughing.

For the first time in history, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have been grasped by the broad masses in a country of seven hundred million people. Mao Zedong Thought unites all the people of China, and undoubtedly it will also unite all the people of the world. The great leader Chairman Mao has opened up a new road to revolutionary victory for the revolutionary people of the whole world. The revolutionary people of the world are proud to have a powerful revolutionary base—China.

The hearts of the people of the whole world are with China, with the center of the world revolution—Beijing, where Chairman Mao Zedong works and resides.

　　北京展示了世界革命的未来和前途
　　拉丁美洲　玛努埃尔·裴尔南德斯
    北京沐浴在节日的气氛里。街道换上新装，到处是沸腾、欢乐的景象。《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌的歌声此伏彼起，红旗迎风招展。大街上，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》的游行队伍和集会的人群川流不息，宽阔的大道两旁，人们正以一种中国独具的新形式把它布置起来，使城市染上了特殊色彩。这些说明了什么呢？说明这是迄今为止人类历史上从未实现过的群众大民主的盛大节日。敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢造反的中国人民正在谱写自己的历史，正在决定着自己的未来。中国文化大革命正在从胜利走向胜利。
    目前正在进行着一场对中国和对全世界来说都是极为重要的斗争，这是两条路线、两种前途的战斗，这是一场资产阶级和无产阶级的大决战。从北京的街头，人们能够预见到世界革命的未来和前途。
    在中国到处热气腾腾，到处都笼罩着革命大批判和革命大联合的气氛。广大革命群众正准备在文化大革命的高潮中迎接建国十八周年。
    毛主席总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是研究和总结了第一个社会主义国家苏联改变了颜色的教训。毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，以准确的科学性提出了社会主义的整个时期还存在阶级和阶级斗争，社会主义同资本主义谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决的英明论断，并以这一光辉的论断武装了中国人民，为防止资本主义复辟提供了强大的思想武器。
    在中国革命的各个时期，是毛主席指明了前进的航道。但是，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线遭到中国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的疯狂抵抗和反对。在中国革命胜利之后，两条路线的斗争一直都是存在的。
    夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政的问题是马克思主义已经解决了的。但是，怎样才能保证把已经夺得的政权巩固下来，不使资本主义复辟，国家不会改变颜色呢？怎样反对和防止在无产阶级专政的国家出现修正主义呢？毛主席从理论上和实践上正确地解决了关系着中国也关系着世界前途和命运的重大问题。
    在理论上，毛主席提出了关于社会主义时期存在着阶级和阶级斗争的学说，并指出了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的必要性。在实践上，毛主席亲自发动和领导了这场无产阶级文化大革命。
    我在中国看到的和正在看到的是一幕幕激动人心、朝气勃勃的景象。这是一场尖锐、严肃、深刻的阶级斗争，是一场史无前例的大革命运动。亿万群众发动起来了，他们充分享受了无产阶级专政下的大民主，把中国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，进行批判、斗争。
    当前中国亿万人民正在进行革命大批判。革命大批判是一场大规模的群众性批判运动，目的在于把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭，拔除修正主义的毒根。在这场群众性的革命大批判中，中国的亿万群众人人都是批判家。
    为了深刻进行革命大批判，并把它往前推进一步，广大的革命派正在以前所未有的步伐加速联合起来。
    目前，中国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。群众充分发动起来了。他们正在进行群众性的革命大批判和革命大联合。中国共产党变得更加强大了，广大的党员在阶级斗争的风浪中进一步锻炼了自己。在经济战线上，出现了工农业生产的新的跃进局面。在猛批资产阶级和封建的文艺的基础上，已经出现了真正的优秀的无产阶级的文艺样板，如革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、革命现代戏《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》等等。更令人鼓舞的是，在科技方面成功地爆炸了氢弹。
    在军事战线上，由于以毛泽东思想作为指导思想，广大战士们政治水平提高了，伟大的中国人民解放军的战斗力更加提高了。在“三支”“两军”工作中，伟大的中国人民解放军建立了和正在建立新功。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部牢牢地掌握了文化大革命进程，英明地指导着运动。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响已经冲破了国界，震撼着全世界。帝国主义和现代修正主义为之发抖，一切反动派为之发抖。世界各国人民则为之鼓舞，特别是把中国无产阶级的胜利看作自己的胜利的国际无产阶级为之欢笑。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在历史上第一次在七亿人民的国家为广大群众所掌握。毛泽东思想统一全中国人民，毫无疑问也将统一全世界人民。伟大领袖毛主席为全世界革命人民开辟了通向革命新胜利的航道，世界革命人民为有强大的革命基地——中国而感到自豪。
    全世界人民的心向着中国，向着世界革命的中心——毛泽东主席工作和居住的地方北京。
