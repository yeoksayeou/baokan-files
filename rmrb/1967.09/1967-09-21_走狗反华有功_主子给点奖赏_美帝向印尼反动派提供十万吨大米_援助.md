The imperialist United States decided on the 15th to provide ten million tons of rice to its running dog, the Indonesian fascist military regime, as a reward for its anti-China actions.

According to a broadcast by the Jakarta radio station, a pact signed by U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Green and the Indonesian fascist military regime's Foreign Minister Malik in Jakarta states that these ten million tons of rice are worth nearly $20 million, to be paid in Indonesian rupiah over a period of 40 years. Malik, in a servile manner, expressed his "great appreciation" for the "aid" from the U.S. master. He said that from 1966 to the present, the Indonesian fascist military regime has reached agreements with the United States to purchase nearly $65 million worth of goods.

The reactionary Jakarta newspaper "Social Messenger" recently published an article titled "Indonesia and U.S. Relations," openly admitting that while the Indonesian fascist military regime is fiercely anti-China and anti-Chinese, its relationship with its U.S. master is "getting better and better."

　　美帝向印尼反动派提供十万吨大米“援助”
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义十五日决定向它的走狗——印尼法西斯军人政权提供十万吨大米，作为反华奖赏。
    据雅加达电台广播，由美国驻印尼大使格林和印尼法西斯军人政权外交部长马利克在雅加达签订的一项协定说，这些大米价值近两千万美元，将用印尼盾来偿付，期限四十年。马利克在签字仪式上低三下四地表示，印尼法西斯军人政权对美国主子的这项“援助”“十分赞赏”。他说，从一九六六年到现在，印尼法西斯军人政权同美国已经达成了向美国购买差不多六千五百万美元货物的协定。
    雅加达反动报纸《社会使者报》最近以《印尼和美国的关系》为题发表文章，毫不掩饰地供认，印尼法西斯军人政权在大肆反华排华的同时，同它的美国主子之间的关系“越来越好”。
