In the glorious light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the triumphant songs of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the agricultural front has brought good news: this year, China's agricultural production has achieved tremendous successes in continuous leaps. Except for a few regions, grain crops and economic crops have generally been bountiful, with all crops yielding well. Many crops have surpassed the highest yields since the founding of the nation or in history. Now, from south to north, from east to west, from plains to mountains, the vast rural areas are surging with revolutionary waves and resounding with songs of harvest.

This year, China's summer grain crops increased by nearly 10% compared to last year, rapeseed increased by more than 10%, and early and middle-season rice also saw bountiful harvests. Following the summer crop harvest, the autumn harvest is now underway across the country. The early autumn crops that have been harvested are a significant bumper harvest. The late autumn crops are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

This year, both grain crops and economic crops are showing a prosperous scene. Not only have the total and per-unit area yields of rice, which has traditionally been high-yielding, increased significantly compared to last year, but even drought-resistant grains, which have traditionally seen less increase, have also seen significant increases in total and per-unit area yields. Oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts have also seen notable increases. Particularly heartening is the cotton crop, which has seen significant increases for four consecutive years. This year, the cotton crop is growing even better than last year's bumper harvest. Now, in the cotton fields stretching to the horizon in the north and south, the cotton plants are robust, and the cotton bolls are plump. The first blooms have already been picked and marketed, and the mid-to-late season cotton bolls are blooming one after another. Farmers across the country are busily selecting and saving seeds, picking and processing, ensuring high yields and bumper harvests. The production of hemp and silkworm cocoons has exceeded the highest levels since the founding of the nation. The production of sugar crops and flue-cured tobacco has surpassed historical highs. Tea production has also increased significantly from last year's bumper harvest. This year, not only have the high-yielding regions with better agricultural infrastructure and production conditions continued to achieve high yields, but even the northern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that were previously prone to flooding and drought, had poor production conditions, and had lower production levels, have seen significant improvements in their production conditions and yields due to extensive agricultural infrastructure construction and strengthened field management. These situations vividly demonstrate that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a powerful driving force for the rapid development of China's agricultural production.

This year, China's hundreds of millions of revolutionary peasants and the vast number of rural revolutionary cadres, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have held high the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They deeply understood that "grain must be grasped, cotton must be grasped, and cloth must be grasped," and the great significance of achieving the strategic task of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." With united efforts, they have mustered revolutionary enthusiasm, fully utilized the advantages of the people's communes, and striven to improve production. They have relied on the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist and agricultural support troops to resolutely fight against the sabotage of revolution and production by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, finally achieving double victories in revolution and production.

At the critical moment of spring production this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, in an attempt to save their failing fate, once stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism, inciting some peasants to leave their production posts, in a despicable attempt to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, sabotage the collective economy of the people's communes, and sabotage agricultural production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, following the instructions of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in the Countryside," firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. They thoroughly exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary tricks of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, repelled their ferocious counterattacks, raised their political awareness, ignited boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and production passion, and promptly engaged in spring plowing and production without missing the agricultural season. Whether in the northern regions where drought-resistant grains are mainly planted or in the southern regions and vast economic crop areas where rice is mainly planted, all completed the spring sowing tasks on schedule and with guaranteed quality. The cotton-growing regions of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong in the Yellow River basin overcame the drought difficulties of last winter and this spring, planted cotton in drought conditions, thereby increasing the national cotton planting area. The regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Shanghai along the Yangtze River overcame the adverse conditions of low temperatures and heavy rains, timely raised seedlings and transplanted rice, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

During the autumn crop growth period, the broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, established and improved the system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, raised the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, promoted ideological revolutionization, and promoted the development of the rural revolutionary criticism movement. Many regions' peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, through their criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line proposed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev, which aimed to sabotage the collective economy of the people's communes and achieve capitalist restoration, and through their exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in their own regions and units, further raised their socialist awareness and more firmly resolved to take the socialist road and consolidate the collective economy of the people's communes. Through revolutionary criticism, they promoted revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, greatly enhancing the socialist initiative of the broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres. Great spiritual power was transformed into great material power. Revolutionary criticism promoted the field management and various increase-production measures for autumn crops. Farmers in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China were more diligent than last year in strengthening weeding, irrigation, and fertilization, and agricultural infrastructure construction also expanded. Although most regions in China this year had favorable weather, many regions had more pests. Due to the high production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, pest control was done well, and most regions did not suffer from disasters. The few regions that did suffer from disasters minimized the losses.

Currently, the broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres are concentrating their efforts on the "three autumns" work. For crops that have matured, they are carefully harvesting and threshing; for crops that have not yet matured, they are further strengthening late-stage management, reasonably arranging forces, doing a good job in autumn plowing and autumn sowing, striving to achieve good production, good harvesting, good seed selection, good procurement, good distribution, good storage, and laying a solid foundation for next year's summer grain bumper harvest.

The broad masses of agricultural and pastoral workers on the livestock front, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," have self-reliantly and arduously struggled, making this year's livestock production present a prosperous scene.

Relevant departments' data show that this year, the number of large livestock such as horses, cattle, mules, and donkeys, as well as pigs and sheep, in China has increased to varying degrees compared to last year, with the increase in sheep being particularly significant. Major livestock production areas in China, such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and agricultural areas such as Hebei, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, have seen much larger increases in large livestock and pigs and sheep this year compared to last year.

Various regions have made progress in the promotion of livestock breeds and breeding management, and the quality of livestock is generally better than last year, with a significant increase in the rate of livestock increase and preservation.

The prosperous scene of China's livestock production is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the result of the broad masses of agricultural and pastoral workers, under the inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seizing the revolution, and vigorously promoting production.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of agricultural and pastoral workers actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," and conducted a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev in rural and pastoral areas. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of agricultural and pastoral workers further raised their socialist awareness and more firmly resolved to take the socialist road and manage the collective economy of the people's communes well. They transformed the boundless enthusiasm ignited in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, determined to develop livestock production rapidly, efficiently, and economically. The broad masses of pastoral workers in China's major pastoral areas, relying on the advantages of the collective economy of the people's communes, self-reliantly built water conservancy projects and strengthened grassland construction, creating good conditions for livestock increase and production, ensuring the overall increase in livestock production. Among them, the number of large and small young livestock bred in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has significantly increased compared to last year. The broad masses of agricultural commune members, following Chairman Mao's policy of combining agriculture and livestock, while doing a good job in agricultural production, also vigorously promoted livestock production, achieving remarkable results. Especially in the past few years, the regions of Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, which were severely affected by natural disasters and had relatively low production levels and slow development of livestock production, have seen significant development in livestock production this year.

This year, due to the strengthening of epidemic prevention and breeding management work, the survival rate of young livestock in various regions is high, and the loss of adult livestock is significantly reduced compared to last year. The main pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, such as the Hulunbuir Grassland, suffered a severe snowstorm last winter and this spring. The broad masses of herdsmen, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, overcame this major natural disaster, actively did a good job in livestock disease prevention, and this year the survival rate of young livestock was 8.9% higher than last year, and the survival rate of adult livestock reached more than 96%.

    毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命成为推动生产发展的强大动力
　　我国农业生产普遍丰收样样丰收
　　广大农村革命浪潮滚滚，丰收凯歌阵阵；许多作物产量超过建国以来或历史上最高水平
　　畜牧业一片大好形势，马牛骡驴猪羊头数都比去年增长
    新华社二十八日讯　在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，农业战线传来了喜讯：今年我国农业生产取得了持续跃进的巨大成就。全国粮食作物和经济作物除了少数地区以外，普遍获得丰收，而且样样丰收。有许多作物的产量，已分别超过建国以来或历史上的最高水平。现在，从南到北，从东到西，从平原到山区，喜看广大农村，革命浪潮滚滚，丰收歌声阵阵。
    今年，我国夏粮作物比去年增产将近一成，油菜籽增产一成还要多，早稻和中稻也普遍获得丰收。继夏季作物丰收之后，目前秋收已在全国各地大规模地展开。已经收割的早秋作物，是一个较大的丰收年景。晚秋作物长势也普遍喜人，丰收在望。
    今年，无论是粮食作物或经济作物，都是一派丰收景象。不仅一向高产的水稻总产量和单位面积产量比去年有较大幅度的增长，而且一向增产较少的旱粮，今年的总产量和单位面积产量也都有较大幅度的增长。大豆、花生等油料作物也有显著增长。特别振奋人心的是连续四年获得大幅度增产的棉花，今年长势比丰收的去年还要好。现在，南北棉区，一望无际的棉田，棉株茁壮，棉桃肥大。头喷花已经采摘上市，中晚期棉铃正在陆续吐絮。各地棉农正在紧张地做好选种、留种和收摘、加工等工作，保证丰产丰收。麻类和蚕茧的产量，都已超过建国以来的最高水平。糖料、烤烟产量已超过历史最高水平。茶叶也在去年丰收的基础上，又有较大幅度的增长。今年，不仅那些农田基本建设较好、生产条件较为优越的高产地区，继续获得高产，原来易涝易旱、生产条件较差、生产水平较低的北方几个省、市、自治区，由于大搞农田基本建设和加强田间管理，生产面貌也有了显著改变，产量有了较大幅度上升。这些情况生动地表明，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经成为推动我国农业生产迅速发展的强大动力。
    今年，我国亿万革命农民和广大农村革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的战斗号召，深刻认识到，“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”，对实现“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略任务的伟大意义，万众一心，鼓足革命干劲，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，努力搞好生产。他们紧紧依靠人民解放军支左、支农部队的大力支援，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏革命和生产的行为进行坚决斗争，终于取得了革命、生产双胜利。
    在今年春季生产的关键时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了挽救其失败的命运，一度刮起反革命经济主义妖风，煽动部分农民脱离生产岗位，企图达到破坏文化大革命、破坏人民公社集体经济、破坏农业生产的卑鄙目的。广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，按照《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》的指示，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，狠抓革命，猛促生产，彻底揭露和批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命伎俩，打退了他们的猖狂反扑，提高了自己的政治觉悟，激发起无比高涨的革命干劲和生产热情，不违农时地投入了春耕生产。无论是以种旱粮为主的北方地区，还是以种水稻为主的南方地区和广大经济作物区，都按计划、保质量地完成了春播任务。黄河流域的山西、陕西、河北、山东等棉区，还克服了去冬今春干旱的困难，抗旱种棉，从而使全国棉田播种面积有所扩大。长江流域的江苏、浙江、江西、湖南、上海等地，战胜了低温多雨的不利条件，及时地育秧插稻，为今年农业丰收打下了基础。
    在秋季作物生长期间，广大农民群众和农村革命干部，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，建立和健全了活学活用毛主席著作的制度，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动提高到新的水平，促进了思想革命化，推动了农村革命大批判运动的开展。不少地区的农民群众和农村革命干部，通过对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派提出的妄图破坏人民公社集体经济、实现资本主义复辟的反革命修正主义路线的批判，通过对本地区、本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的揭发、批判和斗争，进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，更加坚定了走社会主义道路、巩固人民公社集体经济的决心。通过革命的大批判，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，大大地提高了广大农民群众、农村革命干部的社会主义积极性。伟大的精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。革命的大批判推动了秋季作物的田间管理和各项增产措施的贯彻。华北、东北、西北等地农民都比去年更加勤奋地加强了夏锄、灌水、追肥等工作，农田基本建设工作也有所扩展。今年我国大部分地区虽然风调雨顺，但是不少地区虫害较多。由于广大农民生产积极性高涨，灭虫工作做得较好，绝大部分没有成灾，少数成灾的地区也把损失减轻到最低限度。
    当前，广大农民群众和农村革命干部，正在集中力量，狠抓“三秋”工作。对已成熟的作物，进行细收细打，对还未成熟的作物，进一步加强后期管理，妥善安排力量，搞好秋耕秋种，力争做到生产好，收割好，选种好，征购好，分配好，保存好，为明年夏粮丰收打下可靠基础。
    新华社二十八日讯　我国畜牧业战线的广大农牧民群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，使今年的畜牧业生产呈现一派大好形势。
    有关部门提供的资料表明，今年我国马、牛、骡、驴等大牲畜和猪、羊的头数比去年有不同程度的增长，特别是羊只的增长幅度更大。我国畜牧业主要产区的内蒙古、新疆、青海以及农业区的河北、河南、吉林、辽宁、黑龙江等地，今年大牲畜和猪、羊的增长速度都比去年要大得多。
    各地的牲畜良种推广工作和饲养管理工作都有进步，牲畜质量普遍好于去年，增畜保畜率有很大的提高。
    我国畜牧业生产的这个大好形势，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是广大农牧民群众，在无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞下，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产的结果。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大农牧民群众积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的号召，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在农村、牧区推行的反革命修正主义路线，进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，通过革命的大批判，广大农牧民进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，更加坚定了走社会主义道路、办好人民公社集体经济的决心，他们把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去，决心多快好省地发展畜牧业生产。我国主要牧业区的广大牧民，依靠人民公社集体经济的优越性，自力更生兴修水利，加强草原建设，为牧业增产创造了良好条件，保证了畜牧业的全面增产。其中，内蒙古自治区接育的大小仔畜比去年大大增加。广大农业区社员，根据毛主席提出的农牧并举的方针，在搞好农业生产的同时，也大抓了畜牧业生产，成绩也很显著。特别是前几年受自然灾害影响较大，生产水平较低，畜牧业生产发展较慢的河北、河南、辽宁、黑龙江等省，今年畜牧业生产都有了较大的发展。
    今年，广大农牧民群众由于加强了畜疫防治和饲养管理工作，各地的仔畜成活率高，成畜的损失也比去年大大减少。内蒙古自治区主要牧区的呼伦贝尔草原，去冬今春曾遭到严重的暴风雪袭击，广大牧民依靠毛泽东思想，战胜了这场特大的自然灾害，积极做好畜病防治工作，今年仔畜成活率反比去年提高百分之八点九，成畜保活率达到百分之九十六以上。
