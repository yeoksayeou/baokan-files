The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a "Rally to Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries," according to the strong demands of the revolutionary masses, a batch of active counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders were suppressed. This revolutionary measure greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat and greatly dampened the arrogance of a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary masses could not help but applaud.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent, and the movement of deepening revolutionary criticism is underway.

However, "the enemy will not perish of its own accord," and they will inevitably make a last-ditch struggle. In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, American and Kuomintang spies, Soviet revisionist spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, along with hooligans and thieves, are colluding with each other, playing tricks, and shooting from the dark, attempting to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the great People's Liberation Army of China. They spread rumors, incite armed conflicts, sabotage production and state property, and steal state secrets. A handful of social dregs, remnants of the exploiting classes, commit arson and murder, and do all kinds of evil. Against these counter-revolutionary bandits who are frantically sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely suppress them and show no mercy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To maintain social order and the interests of the broad masses, we must also practice dictatorship over thieves, swindlers, arsonists, gangsters, and all those who seriously disrupt social order."

Only by resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and a handful of extremely evil bandits can we guarantee the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, allowing us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and the broad revolutionary masses to fully enjoy the democratic rights of speaking out, airing views fully, big-character posters, and big debates, so as to concentrate our firepower, carry out revolutionary criticism, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units.

Only by resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and a handful of extremely evil bandits can we establish and consolidate the new revolutionary order of the proletariat, safeguard the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, safeguard socialist construction, and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proceeds along the course charted by Chairman Mao to achieve a thorough victory.

The revolutionary faction of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, keep our eyes open, see through the enemy's tricks, and prevent them from causing trouble and fishing in troubled waters. We must actively assist the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat to expose those who operate behind the scenes to incite armed conflicts, those who commit murder, arson, and engage in espionage activities, and implement the dictatorship and legal punishment.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We sternly warn all class enemies: you are only allowed to behave yourselves and not to cause trouble. If you dare to challenge the dictatorship of the proletariat, you will surely be smashed to pieces by the iron fist of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    巩固革命新秩序　坚决镇压反革命	本报评论员
    北京市革命委员会召开了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决镇压反革命宣判大会”，根据广大革命群众的强烈要求，镇压了一批现行反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子。这个革命措施，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的威风。广大革命群众无不拍手称快。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，革命大批判运动正在深入进行。
    但是，“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，他们必然要作垂死挣扎。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死大搏斗中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、美蒋特务、苏修特务、地富反坏右分子和流氓盗窃分子，他们相互呼应，相互配合，耍阴谋，放暗箭，妄图破坏和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，破坏和分裂伟大的中国人民解放军。他们造谣惑众，挑动武斗，破坏生产和国家财产，盗窃国家机密。一小撮社会渣滓，剥削阶级遗留下的匪徒，杀人放火，无恶不作。对于这一小撮疯狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命的反革命匪徒，我们就是要坚决镇压，绝不宽容。
    毛主席教导我们：“为了维护社会秩序和广大人民的利益，对于那些盗窃犯、诈骗犯、杀人放火犯、流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政。”
    只有坚决镇压反革命分子和罪大恶极的一小撮匪徒，才能保障无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，使我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众充分享有大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论等各项民主权利，以便集中火力，进行革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改。
    只有坚决镇压反革命分子和那些罪恶贯盈的一小撮匪徒，才能建立和巩固无产阶级的革命新秩序，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，保卫社会主义建设，保证无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的航道胜利前进，取得彻底胜利。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。一定要加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕性，擦亮眼睛，识破敌人的阴谋诡计，严防他们挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，和他们进行毫不留情的斗争。一定要积极协助无产阶级专政机关，把那些挑动武斗的幕后操纵者，把那些杀人、放火、进行特务活动的现行反革命分子揪出来，实行专政，依法惩处。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要加强和巩固无产阶级专政。我们严厉警告一切阶级敌人，只准你们老老实实，不准你们乱说乱动。如果你们胆敢向无产阶级专政挑战，必将被无产阶级专政的铁拳打得粉身碎骨。
