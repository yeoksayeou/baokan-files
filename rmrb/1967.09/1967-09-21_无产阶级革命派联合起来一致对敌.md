The proletarian revolutionaries unite and join the revolutionary great criticism and great struggle—this is our battle program.

We have every reason to unite. Because we have a common enemy, that is, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

We have every possibility to unite. Because we have a common guiding ideology, that is, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Some people think: “To carry out the great alliance, it means not to distinguish right from wrong.” Today, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle is the greatest “right,” and to go against this direction of the struggle is the greatest “wrong.” To carry out the revolutionary great alliance, to grasp the direction of the struggle, to concentrate forces, and to jointly fight the enemy, this is to distinguish the greatest “right” and “wrong.” All minor rights and wrongs must be subordinate to major rights and wrongs.

Some people think, “The conditions for carrying out the great alliance are not ripe.” To thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the most important condition for further promoting the revolutionary great alliance. Is this condition not ripe today! If what is meant by “the conditions are not ripe” is that some revolutionary organizations have had friction in the past and thus still have some antagonistic sentiments, then this situation is completely changeable. We can, in the process of revolutionary great criticism and revolutionary great alliance, through criticism and self-criticism, eliminate antagonistic sentiments and establish a fighting friendship.

### 无产阶级革命派联合起来一致对敌

　　无产阶级革命派联合起来一致对敌
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，投入革命大批判、大斗争——这是我们的战斗纲领。
    我们完全有理由联合起来。因为我们有共同的敌人，这就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    我们完全有可能联合起来。因为我们有共同的指导思想，这就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    有人认为：“实行大联合，就是不分是非。”在今天，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，就是最大的“是”，违背这个斗争大方向，就是最大的“非”。实行革命的大联合，掌握斗争的大方向，集中力量，共同对敌，这就分清了最大的“是”和“非”。一切小是小非，都要服从大是大非。
    有人认为，“实行大联合，条件不成熟。”彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是进一步促进革命大联合的最主要条件。这个条件，今天难道还不成熟吗！如果所谓“条件不成熟”指的是有些革命组织之间过去有过磨擦，因而还存在一些对立情绪的话，那么这种状况是完全可以改变的。我们可以在革命大批判和革命的大联合的过程中，通过批评和自我批评，消除对立情绪，建立起战斗友谊。　　　（山西《革命造反》报）
