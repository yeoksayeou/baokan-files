A Pakistani government friendship delegation led by Haji Shahabuddin, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, arrived in Beijing by special plane from Guangzhou this evening. Thousands of revolutionary masses from the capital gathered at the airport to warmly welcome the guests from the friendly neighboring country. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and other relevant officials went to the airport to welcome them.

The Pakistani government friendship delegation, at the invitation of the Chinese government, came to China for a friendly visit and to participate in the celebrations of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. China and Pakistan are close neighbors, and the two peoples have always respected each other and lived in friendship. In the struggle against imperialism and foreign aggression, they have supported and encouraged each other; in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and war policies, promoting Asian-African solidarity, and maintaining world peace, they have forged a fighting friendship. The visit of the Pakistani government friendship delegation to China will further strengthen the friendly cooperative relations between China and Pakistan and deepen the friendship between the two peoples.

The atmosphere at the capital airport was filled with the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. The national flags of China and Pakistan fluttered in the wind under the brilliant lights of the airport. The revolutionary masses of the capital, who came to welcome the guests, held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and held up the portraits of Pakistani President Ayub Khan, waiting for the Pakistani guests. After Minister Shahabuddin and his wife, along with the delegation members, stepped off the plane, a group of Red Guards presented the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the Pakistani friends and read aloud the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles against imperialism as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles."

The Pakistani friends, accompanied by Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen and others, walked around the airport to meet with the welcoming crowd. At this time, the airport was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the welcoming crowd repeatedly shouted, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Pakistani people!" "Firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani people against foreign aggression!" Red Guards representatives came out from the crowd and pinned Mao badges on the guests' chests, warmly welcoming the Pakistani friends to visit China at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing in an unprecedentedly good situation. Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan and diplomatic staff from the embassy also went to the airport to welcome them.

The Pakistani friends arrived in Guangzhou by plane this afternoon. When they arrived in and departed from Guangzhou, representatives of the revolutionary masses of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City and relevant officials went to the airport to welcome and see them off.
