Be the Vanguard of Revolution and Production
Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Depot “February 7th” Commune

In the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee have issued a new battle call to us revolutionary masses. We, the revolutionary fighters of the “February 7th” Commune of the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Depot, resolutely respond to this great call. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

“Revolution and production” is the consistent strategic thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. We fighters of the “February 7th” Commune listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Since the January power seizure, we have always insisted on making revolution during our spare time and firmly guarding our production posts, completing the production plan in excess every month. At the same time, we have correctly implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, believing in and relying on revolutionary cadres, daring to let them work, and a large number of cadres have gone to the production front line, becoming the backbone of “revolution and production.” Over the past half year, the revolutionary situation in our depot has been very good, and the production situation has been changing with each passing day. In July this year, the higher authorities took away 30% of the mainline locomotives from our depot to perform other tasks, which brought difficulties to the completion of the production plan. However, we revolutionary fighters have displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, overcome various difficulties, and achieved the technological innovation of changing double-traction to single-traction, greatly improving the transportation efficiency. Relying on the remaining 70% of the locomotives, we have still successfully completed the production tasks.

Now, the Party Central Committee has issued a new battle order to us. We, the revolutionary fighters of the entire “February 7th” Commune, pledge to the Party Central Committee: We will definitely not disappoint the great expectations of our great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, take immediate action, and with the great criticism as the key, vigorously promote revolution and production, be the vanguard of “revolution and production,” and make the greatest contribution to ensuring the smooth flow of national railway transportation.

　　做抓革命促生产的火车头
　　北京内燃机务段“二七”公社
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的大好形势下，党中央负责同志向我们无产阶级革命派发出了新的战斗号令。我们北京内燃机务段“二七”公社的每一个革命战士，最坚决地响应这个伟大号召，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，夺取革命、生产的双胜利。
    “抓革命，促生产”，是伟大领袖毛主席一贯的战略思想。我们“二七”公社的革命战士，最听毛主席的话，自从一月夺权以来，我们始终坚持业余时间闹革命，坚守生产岗位，月月超额完成生产计划。同时，我们正确地贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，相信和依靠革命干部，大胆放手让他们工作，大批的干部走上了生产第一线，成为“抓革命，促生产”的骨干力量。半年多来，我们机务段的革命形势一片大好，生产面貌日新月异。今年七月份，上级在我段调走了百分之三十的干线机车去执行其他任务，给完成生产计划带来了困难。但是，我们革命派战士发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，克服了各种困难，实现了全线双机牵引变单机牵引的技术革新，大大地提高了运输效率，依靠留下的百分之七十的机车，仍然圆满地完成了生产任务。
    现在，党中央向我们发出了新的战斗动员令，我们“二七”公社全体革命战士向党中央保证：我们一定不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的期望，一定紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，立即行动起来，以革命的大批判为纲，大抓革命，大促生产，做“抓革命，促生产”的火车头，为保证全国铁路运输畅通无阻，作出最大的贡献。
