Arab Summit Issues Joint Communiqué
Expresses Determination to Eradicate Israeli Aggression from Arab Lands
Rejects Consideration of PLO's "Six Principles"

KHARTOUM, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) — The Arab Summit, held here, concluded after four days of open and secret sessions on September 1.

The joint communiqué issued by the summit stated, "The Arab Summit has studied the aggression faced by Arab countries on June 5. They have decided: eradicating the traces of aggression from Arab lands is the common responsibility of all Arab countries. This will mobilize the potential of the Arab world, strongly believing that this potential is effective in eradicating the traces of aggression. The setbacks faced by the Arab world should be a powerful stimulus for unity and strengthening Arab actions."

A resolution passed by the summit said, "The kings and heads of state of Arab countries unanimously agreed, based on Arab fundamental obligations and beliefs, to unite their efforts to take common political and diplomatic actions internationally to eradicate the traces of aggression and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli aggressor forces from the Arab territories they occupied after June 5. The fundamental obligations and beliefs of the Arabs are: not to recognize Israel, not to make peace with it, not to negotiate with it, and to uphold the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homes."

The resolution also stated, "It is necessary to take all steps to strengthen military preparedness to deal with any possible situation," and "to accelerate the removal of foreign bases in Arab countries."

In discussing the oil embargo measures taken by some Arab countries during the U.S.-Israel aggression, the summit resolution said, "The resumption of oil exports can be used to serve Arab goals."

Twelve Arab countries' heads of state or representatives attended the summit. Syria did not participate.

After the summit rejected the memorandum of the "Six Principles" proposed by the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO withdrew from the summit in the afternoon of September 1. In this memorandum of the "Six Principles," the PLO pointed out that no Arab government has the right to accept any solution regarding Palestine, and any solution should be agreed upon by all Arab countries and participated in by the Palestine Liberation Organization. The "Six Principles" also include proposals to sever ties with the U.S., Britain, and West Germany, and to intensify guerrilla warfare in Arab territories occupied by Israel.

　　阿拉伯国家首脑会议发表联合公报
　　表示要从阿拉伯领土上消除以色列的侵略痕迹
    拒绝考虑巴勒斯坦解放组织提出的“六项原则”
    新华社喀土穆一日电  在这里召开的阿拉伯国家首脑会议，经过四天公开会议和秘密会议后，于九月一日闭幕。
    会议发表的联合公报说，阿拉伯国家首脑会议“研究了阿拉伯国家六月五日面临的侵略情况，他们决定：把侵略痕迹从阿拉伯领土消除是所有阿拉伯国家的共同责任，它导致动员阿拉伯的潜力，强烈相信这些潜力在消灭侵略痕迹方面是有效的，阿拉伯世界面临的挫折应当是团结和加强阿拉伯行动的强有力的刺激力量。”
    会议通过的一项决议说：“阿拉伯国家的国王和国家元首一致同意，根据阿拉伯的基本义务和信念，统一他们的努力，以便在国际上采取共同的政治和外交行动来消除侵略痕迹并确保以色列侵略军撤出它在六月五日以后所占领的阿拉伯领土，阿拉伯的基本义务和信念是：不承认以色列，不同它和解，不同它举行谈判，而维护巴勒斯坦人民返回他们家园的权利。”
    决议还说，“有必要采取一切步骤加强军事准备以对付可能发生的一切情况”，并“加速撤除设在阿拉伯国家的外国基地”。
    会议决议在谈到美以侵略期间一些阿拉伯国家采取的石油禁运措施时说，会议认为，恢复输送石油“可以利用来为阿拉伯的目标服务”。
    十二个阿拉伯国家的首脑或首脑代表参加了这次会议，叙利亚没有参加。
    在首脑会议拒绝考虑巴勒斯坦解放组织提出的“六项原则”的备忘录以后，巴勒斯坦解放组织在九月一日下午退出了会议。在这“六项原则”的备忘录中，巴勒斯坦解放组织指出，任何一个阿拉伯政府都没有权利接受关于巴勒斯坦的任何解决办法，任何解决办法都应由全体阿拉伯国家同意，并有巴勒斯坦解放组织参加。“六项原则”中还包括同美、英和西德断交以及在被以色列占领的阿拉伯领土上加紧进行游击战等建议。
