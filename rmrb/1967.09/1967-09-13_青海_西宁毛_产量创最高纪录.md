In the great triumph of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the revolutionary herdsmen of various ethnic groups in Qinghai have created a historical high in the production of "Xining Wool."

The Qinghai grasslands are one of the major wool-producing regions in China. The wool produced here is renowned for its elasticity, strength, and durability, and is famous both domestically and internationally. It is known as "Xining Wool" in both domestic and international markets. Now, the annual shearing season has basically come to an end, and wool production has increased across the province. By the end of August, the wool delivered to Xining for storage has reached 13.27 million jin, an increase of 14.49 percent over the same period last year. The quality of the wool has also improved compared to previous years.

    青海“西宁毛”产量创最高纪录
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的大好形势下，青海各族革命牧民创造了“西宁毛”产量的历史最高纪录。
    青海草原是我国的重要羊毛产地之一。这里所产的羊毛以弹性大、拉力强、耐磨擦等特点而驰名中外，在国内、国际市场上，向称“西宁毛”。现在，一年一度的剪毛季节已经基本结束，全省各地的羊毛普遍增产。到八月底，运到西宁入库的羊毛已达一千三百二十七万多斤，比去年同期增加百分之十四点四九。羊毛的质量也比往年提高。
