The British Empire is terrified of the rapid spread of Mao Zedong Thought
Illegally "interrogating" British progressive youth for selling the "Quotations from Chairman Mao"
Violently assaulting Chinese journalists who attended the "interrogation"

NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) — The British government, which is currently engaged in a frenzied anti-China campaign, on the morning of the 20th, directed a large number of British police and plainclothes agents to brutally assault journalists and other personnel from Xinhua News Agency who were lawfully covering the proceedings at the West London Magistrates' Court. This prevented them from attending the "trial" of four progressive youths who were illegally arrested for selling the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This incident is another serious provocation against the Chinese people orchestrated by the British authorities.

The British authorities are terrified and enraged by the rapid spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Britain. They have been frantically arresting progressive individuals in various parts of London under various pretexts for selling the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and subjecting them to shameless political persecution. Following the illegal arrests of Indian progressive Biju, British youth teacher Darin, and Polish worker Paulowski in front of Hyde Park on August 6, and the re-arrest of Darin on August 28, on the evening of September 11, the British police again unlawfully arrested four progressive youths who were selling the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other revolutionary publications near the Earl's Court underground station in West London. They were then subjected to an illegal "trial" on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency correspondent Yu Hang and other personnel from the Xinhua London Bureau rushed to the court on the morning of the 20th to attend the "trial." Fearing that Xinhua journalists would expose their fascist crimes, the British authorities directed the court and police to deliberately provoke the Xinhua journalists and other personnel. They then rudely ordered them to leave the court on the pretext that they refused to stand up to "pay respect" to the judge when he entered the courtroom. When Yu Hang and others engaged in a reasoned struggle with the court authorities and strongly protested, the police and plainclothes agents who were lying in wait outside rushed in and brutally assaulted the Chinese personnel. Several fascist police officers grabbed Yu Hang's arms and forcibly dragged him out of the courtroom. At the same time, other Xinhua personnel who were present to attend the trial were also brutally treated by the police and plainclothes agents and were forcibly pushed out of the courtroom. The British police and plainclothes agents also brutally pushed two Xinhua personnel to the ground outside the court, injuring their faces, hands, and feet.

Yu Hang and others immediately lodged the strongest protest against this fascist atrocity planned by the British authorities.

The fascist violence of the British police aroused great indignation among some British people present. Two British friends who were present to attend the trial were immediately subjected to savage beatings by more than ten police officers and plainclothes agents for expressing their support for the Chinese journalists and strongly condemning the fascist violence of the police. They were also illegally arrested.

After the incident, the Chinese Embassy in London and the Xinhua London Bureau separately lodged the strongest protest with the British Foreign Office. They solemnly pointed out that the British police used fascist violence to obstruct Xinhua journalists from attending the illegal "trial" of individuals who sold the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other revolutionary publications. This shows that British imperialism is afraid of Xinhua journalists exposing its fascist crimes to the world, that it is afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, afraid of the truth, and further exposes the hypocritical nature of British imperialism, which claims to be democratic but is actually fascist. They warned the British authorities that they must bear all the serious consequences that may arise from this.

In the past month, the British government has continued to impose fascist restrictions and surveillance on personnel from the Chinese Embassy in London and other Chinese institutions, including Xinhua journalists in London. Large numbers of police and agents have been surrounding the residences of Chinese institution personnel day and night, obstructing and disrupting their normal diplomatic and business activities, and constantly intensifying various political provocations. The brutal fascist violence committed by the police and agents on the 20th against Xinhua journalists and other personnel is a new serious provocation orchestrated by the British government.

### 英帝对毛泽东思想迅速传播怕得要死　竟非法“审讯”出售《毛主席语录》的英国进步青年　对旁听“审讯”的我国记者进行法西斯暴力袭击

　　英帝对毛泽东思想迅速传播怕得要死
　　竟非法“审讯”出售《毛主席语录》的英国进步青年
　　对旁听“审讯”的我国记者进行法西斯暴力袭击
    新华社伦敦二十二日电　正在猖狂反华的英国政府，二十日上午又指使大批英国警察和便衣特务，悍然对在西伦敦初级法庭进行正常采访活动的新华社记者和新华社其他人员，进行法西斯暴力袭击，阻止他们出席旁听对四位由于出售《毛主席语录》而被非法逮捕的进步青年进行的“审讯”。这次暴行是英国当局策划的又一次对中国人民的严重挑衅事件。
    英国当局对毛泽东思想在英国日益迅速地传播怕得要死、恨得要命，因此不断以种种借口在伦敦各处疯狂逮捕出售《毛主席语录》的进步人士，对他们进行无耻的政治迫害。继八月六日在海德公园前面非法逮捕印度进步人士比朱尔、英国青年教师达林和波兰工人保卢斯基以及八月二十八日再次逮捕达林之后，九月十一日晚，英国警察当局又在西伦敦厄尔斯考特地下车站附近无理逮捕了在那里出售《毛主席语录》和其他革命出版物的四位进步青年，并在二十日对他们进行非法“审讯”。
    新华社驻伦敦记者于杭和新华社伦敦分社其他人员二十日上午赶往法庭旁听这次“审讯”。英国当局害怕新华社记者揭露其法西斯罪行，于是指使法庭和警察有计划地对新华社记者和其他人员进行挑衅，并且以他们在法官进入法庭时拒绝起立向法官“致敬”为借口，蛮横地要他们退出法庭。当于杭等同法庭当局进行说理斗争并向他们提出强烈抗议时，预伏在外面的警察和便衣特务便一拥而上，对中国人员进行野蛮的人身袭击。数名法西斯警察扭住于杭的双臂，强行把他拖出法庭大门。同时在场出席旁听的新华社其他人员也受到警察和便衣特务的野蛮对待，并被强行推出法庭门外。英国警察和便衣特务还在法庭外围野蛮地把两名新华社人员推倒在地上，使他们的脸部、手部和脚部都受了伤。
    新华社记者于杭等当场对英国当局蓄谋策划的这一法西斯暴行，提出了最强烈的抗议。
    英国警察的法西斯暴行引起在场的一些英国人士的极大愤怒。两位在场旁听的英国朋友由于表示支持中国记者，并强烈谴责警察的法西斯暴行，立即遭到十多名警察和便衣特务的野蛮毒打，并被非法逮捕。
    事件发生后，中国驻英代办处和新华社伦敦分社，分别向英国外交部提出最强烈抗议。他们严正指出，英国警察使用法西斯暴力阻挠新华社记者出席旁听英国当局对出售《毛主席语录》和其他革命出版物的人士的非法“审讯”，说明英帝国主义害怕新华社记者向世界人民揭露其法西斯罪行，说明它害怕毛泽东思想，害怕真理，这是英帝国主义假民主、真法西斯面目的进一步暴露。他们警告英国当局必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    英国政府最近一个月以来，一直坚持对中国驻英代办处和其他驻英机构人员，包括新华社驻伦敦记者，进行法西斯限制和监视。大量警察和特务日夜包围中国机构人员的住处，阻挠和破坏他们的正常的外交和业务活动，不断加紧进行各种政治挑衅。警察、特务二十日对新华社记者和其他人员的野蛮法西斯暴行，是英国政府一手策划的一次新的严重挑衅。
