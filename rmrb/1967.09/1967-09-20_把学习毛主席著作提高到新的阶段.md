The People's Liberation Army resolutely implements Comrade Lin Biao's directive to raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level. Broad masses of officers and soldiers are holding meetings to summarize and exchange the major achievements and rich experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past year. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, September 18th marked the first anniversary of Comrade Lin Biao's great call to "raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level." The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, held meetings to review Comrade Lin Biao's directive, summarize, and exchange the major achievements and rich experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past year. They pointed out that in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to follow Comrade Lin Biao's teachings and place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything.

Over the past year since Comrade Lin Biao issued the great call to "raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level," the People's Liberation Army's movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has achieved brilliant results. The broad masses of officers and soldiers have never had such deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; their awareness of class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, and love for the masses has never been so strong; their posture of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and promoting ideological revolutionization has never been so high; there have never been so many advanced units and individuals; and the successors of the proletarian revolution have never grown so fast. The entire army is presenting a new situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

At the meeting to commemorate the first anniversary of Comrade Lin Biao's great call, the broad masses of officers and soldiers believe that at this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is primarily about learning Chairman Mao's great theory and practice of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Over the past year, the officers and soldiers have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and measures for revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, bringing various real problems in the Cultural Revolution. They have gained a deeper understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao and have come to recognize even more Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and greatness. The soldiers excitedly say: The sky is not as high as Chairman Mao's genius, the earth is not as vast as the power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the sea is not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness! The officers and soldiers in various units have, in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. They have greatly enhanced their class consciousness and strengthened their class feelings for the great Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, the broad masses of officers and soldiers have achieved the state of not letting go of Chairman Mao's books with their hands, not letting go of Chairman Mao's words with their mouths, not letting go of Mao Zedong Thought with their hearts, and not letting go of Chairman Mao's teachings with their actions. They are ready to face any danger to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, and on various battlefronts, they have emerged batch after batch of brave and wise soldiers of Chairman Mao.

At the meeting to commemorate the first anniversary of Comrade Lin Biao's great call, the officers and soldiers pointed out that in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, everyone has the issue of standing on which side when observing things and handling problems. Only by arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly transforming one's worldview can one be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, and consciously serve to defend and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. Many units, through the education of the struggle between the two lines, have the officers and soldiers firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" They link their personal thoughts and work with state affairs, with the direction of the struggle, and with the implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies. Some units, through severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's black "Self-Cultivation," have widely drawn portraits of "self" and exposed the harm of "self," and have built the image of "public," forming a mass movement of hating "self," loving "public," criticizing "self," and praising "public," breaking "self," and establishing "public." This has pushed the transformation of worldviews to a new stage. The officers and soldiers also pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" have deeply felt in discussions that in this sharp and complex class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is the most testing of people and the most touching of souls. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle has the deepest understanding and the best results. They often bring with them a series of problems such as how to identify the left, support the left, how to correctly treat the masses, how to carry out revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, study Chairman Mao's works, and achieve new levels of understanding and application.

To further implement Comrade Lin Biao's directive, many units are summarizing the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past year and proposing new requirements. The broad masses of officers and soldiers are determined to take practical actions to welcome the convening of the National Conference of Advanced Elements in Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works, and to report with better results to the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao.

    人民解放军坚决贯彻执行林彪副主席的指示
    把学习毛主席著作提高到新的阶段
    广大指战员纷纷集会，总结和交流一年来活学活用毛主席著作的重大成果和丰富经验，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
    据新华社讯　九月十八日，是林彪副主席发出“把学习毛主席著作提高到新的阶段”的伟大号召一周年。中国人民解放军陆海空三军指战员满怀革命豪情，纷纷集会，重温林副主席的指示，总结和交流一年来活学活用毛主席著作的重大成果和丰富经验。他们指出，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，必须遵照林副主席的教导，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。
    在林副主席发出“把学习毛主席著作提高到新的阶段”伟大号召的一年来，人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，取得了光辉的成绩。广大指战员对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无产阶级感情，从来没有象今天这样深；对阶级斗争、无产阶级专政和热爱人民群众的观念，从来没有象今天这样强；破私立公，搞好思想革命化的姿态从来没有象今天这样高；先进单位和先进人物，从来没有象今天这样多；无产阶级革命接班人，从来没有象今天成长得这样快。全军上下，到处呈现着活学活用毛主席著作的崭新局面。
    在纪念林副主席伟大号召一周年的集会上，广大指战员认为，在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻，活学活用毛主席著作，首要的是学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大理论和实践。一年来，指战员们带着文化大革命中的各种现实问题，反复认真地学习了毛主席提出的无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，更深刻地认识到毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，更加认识到毛主席无比英明，无比伟大。战士们激动地说：天高没有毛主席的天才高，地大没有毛泽东思想的威力大，海深没有毛主席的恩情深！各部队指战员在革命大批判中，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，红箭射黑靶，大大提高了阶级觉悟，增强了对伟大的毛泽东思想的阶级感情。目前，广大指战员做到了手不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，心不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的教导，他们为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，在各个战斗岗位上涌现出一批又一批大智大勇的毛主席的好战士。
    在纪念林副主席伟大号召一周年的集会上，指战员们还指出，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，每个人观察事物，处理问题，都有个站在哪一边的问题，只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，彻底改造世界观，才能无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，站稳无产阶级立场，自觉地为保卫和加强无产阶级专政服务。许多部队通过两条路线斗争的教育，指战员们牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”他们把个人的思想和工作同国家大事联系起来，同斗争大方向联系起来，同执行党的路线、方针、政策联系起来。有些单位通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》，广泛给“私”字画像，大揭“私”字的危害，大树“公”字的形象，形成一个群众性的恨私爱公，批私赞公，破私立公的自觉革命的热潮，使世界观的改造推向了一个新的阶段。指战员们还指出，无产阶级文化大革命是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。许多战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，在座谈会上深有体会地说，在无产阶级文化大革命这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，最能考验人，最能触及灵魂，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，理解最深，效果最好。他们经常带着如何识别左派、支持左派，如何正确对待群众，如何开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命的“三结合”等一系列问题，学习毛主席著作，学出了新水平，用出了新水平。
    为进一步贯彻林副主席的指示，许多部队正在总结一年来活学活用毛主席著作的情况，提出新的要求。广大指战员决心以实际行动，迎接全军活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的召开，用更优异的成绩，向伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席汇报。
