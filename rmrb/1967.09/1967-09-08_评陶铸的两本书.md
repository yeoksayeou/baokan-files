Edition: 1

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a series of sudden storms, has shaken all of China and reverberated throughout the world.

The situation is excellent. The Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which began with a great criticism in the cultural sphere, has, after a year of stirring battles, now triumphantly entered the stage of mass criticism of the handful of top party cadres who are taking the capitalist road. This mass criticism has great political significance. It is a deepening of the struggle for power by the revolutionary masses, a major step in eliminating revisionist poison, a driving force for mobilizing millions of people to engage in struggle, criticism, and transformation, and a massive struggle to thoroughly implement Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line in the political, economic, cultural, and military spheres.

The two books before us: *Ideals, Morality, and Spiritual Life* (hereafter referred to as *Ideals*), published in 1962 by the Chinese Youth Press, and *Thought, Emotion, and Eloquence* (hereafter referred to as *Thought*), published in 1964 by the Guangdong People's Press, are excellent negative teaching materials for our great criticism. They vividly portray the reactionary and ugly soul of Tao Zhu, a revisionist.

Before the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Tao Zhu was a faithful executor of the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, when the reactionary faces of the two top party cadres taking the capitalist road were exposed to the entire party, he became the main representative of the continued execution of the bourgeois reactionary line. Together with his close associates, the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Wang Renzhong, he continued to fiercely oppose and distort the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, opposed and resisted the great Mao Zedong Thought, and colluded with the party cadres taking the capitalist road to suppress revolutionary masses, support and shield counter-revolutionary revisionist elements and ghosts and monsters, attempting to use despicable means to cover up and overthrow the criticism of the party's Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee against the top party cadres taking the capitalist road.

The progress of history always makes those who overestimate the strength of the reactionaries, underestimate the strength of the people, and foolishly try to portray themselves as "heroes" quickly become laughing stocks. On July 30, 1966, when this individual, who boasted of being "basically a proletarian revolutionary," arrogantly shouted at a mass rally, "If you don't believe me, you can overthrow me too," how proud he was! He almost wanted to devour people! He wanted to intimidate the masses: Whoever dared to oppose this "old revolutionary" would be in trouble, while he, the "hero," was absolutely "unbeatable." However, the logic of history is like this: Whoever stands up to oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, oppose the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and oppose the broad revolutionary masses will definitely be overthrown. The more thoroughly the reactionaries perform, the more thoroughly they will be overthrown. Looking back, his self-proclaimed and intimidating ugly appearance was merely an additional layer of ridiculous makeup on the face of a two-faced person.

"I am a consistent revolutionary." Well, let's use these two books as the main materials to see what this "consistent revolutionary" has been "consistently" following, what "revolution" he has been "making," what "ideals" he has been upholding, what "morality" he has been advocating, what class's "thought and emotion" he has been promoting, and what kind of "spiritual life" he has been leading.

The Ideals of the Bourgeois Counter-Revolutionaries

What "faction" is Tao Zhu? The "ideals" advocated in the book are the "ideals" of which faction? Just look at his self-incriminating statements:

In August 1955, when the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts was at its peak and the proletariat was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the bourgeoisie, Tao Zhu jumped out and proudly declared: "We are all one faction, and this faction is called the Chinese People's Faction. Except for counter-revolutionaries, everyone should unite closely." The "everyone" mentioned here is divided into two: the proletariat on one side and the bourgeoisie on the other. Tao Zhu maliciously slandered the ideological remolding of intellectuals as "humiliating human dignity" and absurdly claimed that Hu Shi's reactionary ideas were merely a "problem of thinking methods" and that "in thirty or forty years" it would be clear. Obviously, the "everyone" he mentioned refers to the bourgeoisie and their agents like Hu Shi. The "Chinese People's Faction" that Tao Zhu boasted about, which should "unite closely," is actually the anti-people bourgeois reactionary faction.

In the same report, Tao Zhu also said with boundless sympathy: "The current situation of counter-revolutionaries hiding on the mainland is pitiful, and their feelings are painful." Words reveal the heart. A "pitiful" and "painful" statement cancels out the hatred and brutality of the counter-revolutionaries, vividly portraying his spiritual life of heart-to-heart communication with the counter-revolutionaries. Such a brilliant "statement" was deleted from the book as part of the "summary" when it was included.

Two years later, in May 1957, when the rightists were rampantly attacking, Tao Zhu immediately wrote an article in the newspaper shouting, "Now the classes have basically been eliminated," "the domestic contradictions between the enemy and us have been resolved," and the "dictatorial functions" of the proletarian dictatorship should be weakened and turned to "leading production" and "organizing the economic life of the people." Landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie all became members of a "big family," and the proletarian dictatorship could be abolished, with only a "people's state" that manages production. This thoroughly revisionist tune, which overturns the proletarian dictatorship, is completely the face of a bourgeois rightist leader.

Two years later, in the first half of 1959, when the socialist revolution was further deepened, Tao Zhu, in *The Style of the Pine Tree*, advocated "never yielding to adverse conditions." In *The Firmness of Revolution*, he advocated facing the sea and enduring the onslaught of "stormy winds." The magnificent Great Leap Forward and the heroic ambition of revolutionary people to change the world were called "adverse conditions" by him. The socialist revolution storm struck the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and their agents, the Peng Dehuai anti-party clique, but he shouted, "We must endure the onslaught of stormy winds." Without adding a single word, his counter-revolutionary stance is as clear as day.

Six years later, in 1965. After the great Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly pointed out that the main contradiction within the country is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, and in the "Twenty-three Articles" on the socialist education movement, he pointed out that "the focus of this movement is to rectify those party cadres who are taking the capitalist road." The Chinese Khrushchev and Tao Zhu and his ilk, however, went mad in opposing and resisting these important instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong. In November 1965, when the criticism of *The Dismissal of Hai Rui* had just begun and a life-and-death struggle with the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the Chinese Khrushchev, was imminent, Tao Zhu once again "appeared" in the mouthpiece of the counter-revolutionary literary line, *Literary Gazette*. He said: "I think that in the current stage, the task of reflecting the contradictions within the people should be placed in the most important position." He talked about the "main contradictions" of the "current stage" being "contradictions within the people," which is a blatant attempt to cover up the main contradictions within the country as the struggle between two classes and two roads, to cover up the crimes of a handful of counter-revolutionaries, traitors, rightists, and party cadres taking the capitalist road, and to shield a group of ruthless bourgeois counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the party.

What "consistent revolution"? A consistent counter-revolution! It can be said that at every critical moment in history, he openly stood on the bourgeois stance to oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and oppose socialism. The various "ideals" he boasted about are the ideals of the bourgeois counter-revolutionaries, the reactionary ideals of protecting and developing capitalism, and the delusional wish to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship in China and achieve the restoration of capitalism.

Look:

First, he says: "Socialist thought is to use all means to ensure the rapid industrialization of the country." According to this extremely reactionary "socialist" theory, isn't the United States, which has industrialized, already realized "socialism"? To "industrialize," there are two roads, two lines, and two methods: socialism and capitalism. Taking the socialist road means relying on the working class and the broad revolutionary masses, relying on politics in command, relying on the revolutionary consciousness and initiative of hundreds of millions of people aroused by Mao Zedong Thought, to truly grasp the leadership of enterprises in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries; taking the capitalist road means relying on a few bourgeois "experts," relying on material incentives, relying on conservatives, and seizing the leadership of enterprises by the privileged class representing the interests of the bourgeoisie. The so-called "all means" is to use the methods of relying on the bourgeoisie to develop the capitalist system of exploitation and resist the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

"China's history of the past hundred years has been a history of being beaten, and the reason is that we did not have industry." Tao Zhu, as if a mediocre history teacher, lectures us on modern Chinese history, of course, in a distorted way. From 1840 to 1949, these 109 years, the reason why the Chinese people were "beaten" was mainly not because they lacked industry, but because the power was in the hands of the running dogs of imperialism, from the Qing government, the Beiyang warlords to Chiang Kai-shek, these traitors. Since the proletariat and the working people of China, under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, seized national power, imperialism wants to attack us again, it must first think about how hard its pig's hooves are. The more thorough the Cultural Revolution is, the deeper Mao Zedong Thought penetrates the hearts of the people, the more consolidated the proletarian dictatorship is, the more invincible we will be in battle. This is the "ideal" of the proletarian revolutionaries. Attributing all the past "beatings" to "lack of industry" covers up the crimes of those traitors who have committed heinous crimes and beautifies those who, under the guise of "developing industry," are restoring capitalism in China, the running dogs of the international bourgeoisie. This is the same treacherous tune as that of the Chinese Khrushchev!

Second, he says: "The ideal of communism" is "a comfortable house," "to make all rooms light up at night, to make all people wear neat and beautiful clothes, to go out and be able to take a car..." In a word, it is to "eat well, dress well, and live well." It is hedonism. Whoever gives him "good food and good living," he can sell his soul and even give away a "communist" hat at a low price. This is the most despicable philosophy of traitors! The "communist" cloak, the essence of extreme individualism, that is, capitalism, is the definition of Tao Zhu's so-called "communist ideal." According to this definition, isn't the life of the American bourgeoisie the most in line with the "communist ideal"?

Third, he says: "The lofty ideal" is to always think of becoming a "navigator, aviator, scientist, writer, engineer, teacher..." Family, family, family, there is no worker, peasant, or soldier. In the eyes of this proletarian traitor, the position of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers should all be placed very "low," not only low, but should be thrown into hell and pressed to the lowest level, never to rise again. While those who are placed very high, even extremely "lofty," are a long list of bourgeois "families." "The bourgeoisie participated in the democratic movement, they have knowledge in industry, and they are not as corrupt as the landlords." Right, this exposes your "families," which are not proletarian experts, but representatives of the bourgeoisie and their cultural figures. Your so-called "knowledge" is about how capitalists cleverly and cruelly exploit workers and the like. Tao Zhu's "lofty ideal" is to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration through this group of "highly" placed bourgeois representatives. Today, a group of "highly" placed bourgeois "authorities" have been pulled down by the revolutionary youngsters.

There is another kind: The great ideal is said to be to "truly make everyone's mood pleasant." In 1962, when the bourgeoisie launched a rampant attack on the proletariat, demons danced wildly, and weeds grew rampantly, in order for the bourgeoisie to have a "pleasant mood," Tao Zhu, in the article *Opinions on Promoting Creation*, said that many bourgeois intellectuals have already become intellectuals of the working people and that the initiative of intellectuals of the working people must be fully utilized. What "San Jia Village," what Tian Han, Xiao Yan, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, what Hai Rui, Wei Zheng, Li Huiniang and the like, all "belong to the intellectuals of the working people," after this ceremony of removing and crowning, can they not be more "enthusiastic" in preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism? Everyone is in harmony and very pleasant, can they not comfortably carry out the restoration of capitalism?

The proletariat and the bourgeoisie, one of them must not be "pleasant," this is the inevitable law of class struggle. The day the proletariat is in a "pleasant" mood is the day the bourgeoisie is in trouble. The day the bourgeoisie is in a "pleasant" mood is the day the proletariat is in pain. The two must occupy one. Those who cry out for the bourgeoisie not to be "pleasant" can only prove that they themselves are breathing with the bourgeoisie.

Tao Zhu said: His "socialist ideal" is "beneficial to everyone," including the bourgeoisie. How can socialism, which is realized through the proletarian dictatorship, be beneficial to the bourgeoisie? The so-called "socialist" that is beneficial to everyone is false socialism, Khrushchev-style revisionism, Bukharin's counter-revolutionary theory that capitalism can "grow into" socialism, the reactionary theory of canceling class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, the "full people's party," "full people's state," and "full people's socialism," and the slogan of restoring capitalism in China after the great victory of socialism. Enough! The above materials are enough to make us see clearly the true face of this bourgeois agent. He insists on a capitalist road against socialism. He loves, thinks, and praises capitalism, and hates, fears, and curses socialism. The "ideals" in these articles, in a word, are to use the ugly face of the bourgeoisie to transform the country, society, and the party.

This person has a famous saying: "Establishing socialist thought" or ideals is to "at least make socialist thought occupy more than fifty percent of the whole thought." How can one's worldview be calculated in percentages? This is absurd. Unmasked, it is actually a very clumsy big swindle. This is telling the bourgeoisie to appear in a disguised form, to put the language of "more than fifty percent" on the cloak of "socialist thought" to cover up the ugly essence of capitalism. This is the most typical revisionism. These two books are written in this way. The biggest party cadre taking the capitalist road has said such words to the bourgeoisie: "The bourgeoisie" only needs to "learn Marxist phrases" and can "smile and enter socialism peacefully," gaining both fame and profit. This is the best annotation of the "socialist thought" of "more than fifty percent." "Ideals!" "Ideals!" The bourgeoisie sees such a loyal agent and must be grateful.

The Spiritual Life of a Traitor and a Lackey

Do you want to know what kind of "spiritual life" is advocated in these two books? You don't need to look much, just take the "essence" of it. That is—the reactionary philosophy of the Kuomintang plus the "thought" of a lackey.

Tao Zhu remembers very well and recites very fluently the extremely decadent and reactionary idealism of the Kuomintang and the black words of the executioner Chiang Kai-shek. These counter-revolutionary goods occupy a top position in his "spiritual life." Only the mouth of a traitor can spit out such reactionary things.

Chiang Kai-shek said in his counter-revolutionary speech: "Speaking of the meaning of politics, the late President has clearly told us: 'Politics' is the affairs of the people, 'governance' is management, managing the affairs of the people is 'politics'.... Therefore, the meaning of 'politics' is to achieve the scientific method of national mobilization to manage the affairs of the people and to seek the greatest welfare for the whole country and all the people." Tao Zhu directly copied and said: "First, we must understand what politics is. Everyone probably knows Mr. Sun Yat-sen, right? He said: 'Politics is the affairs of the people, governance is management, managing the affairs of the people is politics'.... We 'manage the affairs of the people' to make the country prosperous and the people happy.... It is to do things for the benefit of the people, to explain the truth, and to make everyone understand the truth and willingly participate in the construction of a socialist society." Tao Zhu shamelessly said: He is Chiang Kai-shek's "student." More accurately, he is a lackey. Look at his words, don't they sound like a lackey!

Calling politics the "management of the affairs of the people" is the reactionary view of the bourgeoisie exploiters. There is no abstract "people," and in a class society, "people" are divided into classes. There is also no abstract "management," and in a class society, "management" is always about handling class relations, which is the question of which class seizes and uses state power. In his speech *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out: "Politics, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, are always class struggles against class." Using Comrade Mao Zedong's viewpoint to analyze, politics is to struggle to consolidate or overthrow the state power of this class or that class; to struggle to protect or destroy this kind of ownership or that kind of ownership; to struggle to seize or maintain the interests of this class (group) or that class (group). The proletariat can only liberate all mankind to finally liberate itself, therefore, the political struggle of the proletariat to overthrow the oppression of the bourgeoisie, to establish and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, not only represents the interests of its own class but also represents the interests of the broad laboring people. While the bourgeoisie, in order to cover up the class content of its political activities and to cover up the oppression and exploitation of the proletariat and the laboring people by the bourgeoisie, abstractly calls counter-revolutionary politics "the management of the affairs of the people." This is a common trick from the bourgeoisie of the 18th century to the modern Soviet revisionists who advocate the "full people's state." Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "management of the people" is to use the bloody counter-revolutionary state machine to suppress and massacre the broad laboring people, to call the counter-revolutionary rule of the landlords and the bourgeoisie "seeking the greatest welfare for the whole country and all the people," and to use what "national mobilization" to deceive, vile and shameless to the extreme. While the lackey Tao Zhu brings out this set, it is to realize the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism, to cancel the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, and to call the servile behavior of serving the interests of the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries "doing things for the benefit of the people," and to use what "explain the truth" to deceive, equally vile to the extreme.

Chiang Kai-shek, in his counter-revolutionary speech, advocated what "sincere and united spirit" and "enlightened first." Tao Zhu directly used it:

"We do not completely deny Mr. Sun Yat-sen's so-called 'enlightened first' and 'enlightened later' saying. In society, there are such situations: some people progress faster, some people progress slower, as long as he has the heart to improve, he will eventually be able to progress...";

"Marxists should demand leniency towards others and strictness towards themselves... Towards non-party comrades, we should not demand too much, we should be like Sun Yat-sen said, 'sincerely united'...".

The saying of "enlightened first" and "enlightened later" is an idealist reactionary view that removes class content and is detached from social practice. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." Those counter-revolutionary revisionists who do not turn back and those die-hard capitalists who do not change their ways are not because they are "enlightened later," but because their social existence, that is, their class position as the bourgeoisie, determines that they stubbornly want to take the capitalist road. The American imperialist murderers and the Soviet revisionist traitors are not because they lack the "heart to improve," but because they are representatives of the reactionary bourgeoisie, and the lines they execute, no matter how many tricks they have, can only be counter-revolutionary lines serving the American monopoly bourgeoisie and the Soviet bourgeoisie privileged class. The proletarian revolutionaries are able to break through numerous obstacles, break through the various heavy and even cruel oppressions of the handful of top party cadres taking the capitalist road, and achieve victory, not because they are "enlightened first," but because they have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, grasped this theoretical weapon that concentrates the highest wisdom of the Chinese and world proletariat, represented the interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring people, so they can fight stronger and stronger, never yield to difficulties, and always maintain vigorous revolutionary optimism. Today, Tao Zhu praises this reactionary idealism, intending to make people believe that the bourgeoisie can eventually "progress," to dull the revolutionary vigilance of the people, and to help the bourgeoisie infiltrate the proletariat to carry out sabotage.

Tao Zhu's so-called "sincere unity" is purely the language of the Kuomintang reactionaries! The same words, different classes give different interpretations. We sometimes use this word, but that is to refer to unity under a certain revolutionary goal, to struggle for the revolutionary tasks of the proletariat. We have always said: unity under the socialist direction, unity based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, Tao Zhu's so-called "sincere unity" is to abandon principles, betray the socialist direction, and adapt to the requirements of the bourgeoisie "sincere unity"! Unity and struggle are two contradictory aspects of a unity, without struggle, there is no such thing as unity. Unity is relative and transitional, while struggle is absolute. Things in the world are always divided into two in development, and people's understanding is always developed in struggle. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Marxism must develop in struggle, not only in the past, but also in the present, and it will inevitably be so in the future." Where is Tao Zhu's eternal "sincere unity"? The fortune-teller hangs a sign saying: "Sincerity brings blessings," that is a trick to deceive people. Chiang Kai-shek uses what "sincere unity" to cover up the internal dog-eat-dog, as a tool to inject fascist thoughts, while Tao Zhu, for the first time, hangs the sign of "Marxism" to dissolve the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.

The book also says: "The reason why the revolution in the early period of the 1925-27 Great Revolution was able to achieve victory was because Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang and implemented the three major policies, 'conforming' to the objective laws of the revolution at that time." It attributes the victory in the early period of the first domestic revolutionary war from 1925 to 1927 to the correct leadership and correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the struggle of the revolutionary people, but instead attributes it all to the Kuomintang. This completely distorts history and reverses right and wrong, speaking from the standpoint of the Kuomintang reactionaries. To give the victory fruits won by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs to the Kuomintang as a show of support, isn't this the tone of a traitor?

Enough! Enough! These filthy words, do they not expose that Tao Zhu's "spiritual life" is deeply rooted in a world of Kuomintang reactionary philosophy?

Apart from the reactionary philosophy of the Kuomintang, the remaining "thought" is completely the garbage from the *Black Cultivation*.

The book *Ideals* is not deceiving the youth by saying that "personal interests and collective interests are inseparable," and as long as you pretend to "do the work well," you will get "attention," "respect," "praise," and even "fame all over China and the world"? This is the unaltered version of the market philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev's opportunist merchant who "takes a small loss to gain a big profit." The biggest party cadre taking the capitalist road said in February 1960 when he met with the standing committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce: "To serve the people wholeheartedly, personal interests will come." This sentence concisely summarizes the experience of this bourgeois careerist's "way of life" over the decades and encapsulates the "essence" of the life philosophy of this traitor to the proletariat. What "serving the people," what "collective interests," all these are false and deceptive, put on for others to see, are means; while grabbing "personal interests," personal power, personal enjoyment is real, is the purpose, is the essence of the ugly soul. This is the trick of the bourgeois counter-revolutionary two-faced people infiltrating the revolution to seize power. Now it is used to poison the younger generation, can we tolerate this sin of killing people with a soft knife?

The book *Ideals* is not also deceiving the youth by saying: "Our common worldview and common way of thinking" is "an attitude that starts from objective reality, is is, non is non"? This is also a commodity from the Chinese Khrushchev. In a class society, right and wrong have clear class standards. The so-called "reality" is first of all the "reality" of class struggle: are you on the side of the proletariat or on the side of the bourgeoisie? Are you on the side of imperialism or on the side of the revolutionary people? Are you on the side of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, or on the side of revisionism? Are you on the side of the proletarian headquarters led by Comrade Mao Zedong, or on the side of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters? To use abstract "right and wrong" to cover up people's class stance when looking at problems is the "common" characteristic of opportunists who sell their souls. In May 1949, the Chinese Khrushchev, in his report on his shameful act of kneeling down to the bourgeoisie in Tianjin, shamelessly said: "The capitalists said our newspaper is not good, I said it is indeed a bit bad, I also admit this mistake.... In the future, we should adopt: is is, non is non, good is good, bad is bad.... The capitalists have good things to say good, workers have bad things to say bad." Look how "objective" he is! "The capitalists have good things to say good" and "workers have bad things to say bad," what a "fair" judge! How clear his "right and wrong" is! How he never forgets the "good" of his master, the bourgeoisie! How clear his ferocious attitude towards scolding workers is! While the author of the book *Ideals* has truly memorized the philosophy of selling souls to a certain person!

Title: Criticism of the Reactionary Philosophy and Poisonous Ideas in the Books "Ideals, Morality, and Spiritual Life" and "Thought, Emotion, and Literary Talent"
Author:
Date: 1967-01-01
Edition: 1

The book "Ideals" distorts "dialectical materialism" into "existence first, thought second; objective first, subjective second." It completely negates the subjective initiative of people, completely negates the transformation of matter into spirit and spirit into matter, and completely negates the dialectical process of people's cognition—practice—cognition—practice. This is not "dialectical materialism" at all, but a reactionary metaphysics. The sole purpose of the proletariat in recognizing the objective world is to transform the objective world according to the laws of its development. If the transformation of the objective world is negated, if revolution is negated, if the struggle to advance history is negated, then "objective first" becomes an empty slogan!

However, merely criticizing it in this way is not enough. We must know that the reason they propagate this mechanical or vulgar materialism is to propagate a kind of opportunism that can go with the flow and sell out the interests of the proletariat at any time, to serve the bourgeoisie. Isn't it true? The bourgeoisie is also an "objective existence." One can start from the bourgeoisie, listen to the bourgeoisie, and take bourgeois interests as the standard. "Is is is, non is non," and thus the restoration of capitalism can be disguised as "seeking truth from facts" and "dialectical materialism." Unmasking the trick, it is just this kind of deception.

Didn't Tao Zhu also enthusiastically tell the youth: "In the world, there are men and women, and there will be love"? This immediately makes one think of the absurd "saying" of China's Khrushchev: "A cow plus a cow is still a cow... but a bull plus a cow forms a new relationship, a man plus a woman becomes a marital relationship. Everything must be a unity of opposites." In their view, the relationship between people is the relationship between a bull and a cow. In a class society, people are divided and united according to class. The relationship between men and women is no exception. Lu Xun said in his article "On the Class Nature of Literature and Hard Translation": "The famine-stricken people in the disaster area will not go to plant orchids like the rich old gentlemen, and Jia Baoyu's servant Jia Laoshi does not love Lin Daiyu." This basic fact is negated and trampled upon by them. Their vulgar language cannot harm Marxism's class analysis by a single hair, but only reflects their view of mutual relationships and their "cultivation," which is the bourgeoisie's ugly and despicable things like "bull plus cow" and "man plus woman." Don't you see that those who talk about "cultivation" are all extremely rotten hypocrites?

The book says, "In a person's several decades of life," the "success or failure" is determined by whether the "subjective" and "objective" are consistent. How did you, in the days of the Kuomintang's rule, so slavishly make the "subjective" consistent with the "objective"? In these "several decades" of "success," how did you make it consistent with American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie? Shouldn't this be brought out into the open in broad daylight?

Deep-seated hatred for the proletariat

In May 1959, just before the revisionist Peng Dehuai threw out his mad plan to restore capitalism, Tao Zhu, in his article "The Glory of the Sun," put on the air of Hai Rui, publicly and maliciously cursing our great socialist cause, our great party, and our great leader. On the one hand, he said that people use "The East is red, the sun rises" to describe the vigorous spirit of our great cause, and use the sun to praise our party and leader; on the other hand, he openly, through attacking the "faults" of the sun, used the method of hinting at things indirectly to say: "When it is extremely hot in summer and the sun scorches people to sweat, people will complain and say that the sun's light and heat are too much. Moreover, everyone knows and has pointed out that the sun itself has black spots."

"The sun itself has black spots." Is this not a naked curse against our party and great leader? In your eyes, it is not just "black spots"; socialism is simply pitch-black. Those who look at problems with bourgeois eyes have light and darkness reversed. They are even more blind than the blind. In the eyes of this revisionist, the socialist glory of the "sun" scorches those who walk the capitalist road so much that they are exposed, "sweating," and "too much," and this is the "fault" of the "sun." In fact, this is precisely the greatness of the "sun." Those demons and ghosts, bedbugs, lice, bacteria, and viruses hiding in dark corners can only die when they see the light and heat of the "sun"; the true laboring people are precisely those who are tempered strong in the glory of the sun. Without sunbathing, without sweating, how can one's body become strong? To curse the "light and heat" of the sun is actually to curse the "excess" of the proletariat, to curse socialism and people's communes "too much." This is pure bourgeois black talk, which precisely exposes oneself as a ghost that cannot see the light.

Didn't Tao Zhu in "The Style of the Pine Tree" praise the pine tree for "in summer, it uses its branches and leaves to block the scorching sun"? The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. To fight against the light is to make oneself fall from darkness into even deeper darkness.

It is worth noting that in 1965, when "Ideals" was reprinted, the sentence "using the sun to praise our party and leader" was suddenly changed to "using the sun to praise our great, glorious, and correct party." This is truly covering up and exposing the thief's heart even more. You delete the word "leader," doesn't this precisely show that from 1959 to 1962, when you wrote this article and published this book, the target was aimed at the great leader? If not, why the hurried deletion? You add "great, glorious, and correct" before "party," doesn't this precisely show that from 1959 to 1962, when you wrote this article and published this book, you thought the Communist Party of China was not great, glorious, and correct? If not, why the hurried addition? With a guilty conscience, the face changes color, and thus the hands and feet are in a hurry. In May 1959, didn't Tao Zhu in his first report in Shantou shout "Learn the style of Hai Rui" to cooperate with Peng Dehuai's attack? It seems that the "style" of this "Hai Rui" is not so "high," and the skills are also very clumsy. However, this change, cooperating with Peng Dehuai and his gang, the crimes of being anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Chairman Mao, is not only self-incriminating but also iron-clad evidence, undeniable.

In late September 1959, the Lushan Conference was over, and the anti-party clique of Peng Dehuai was exposed. The arrogant attack of the revisionists was thoroughly smashed. This revisionist, in his article "Victory Is Not Easy," had to pretend to be dissatisfied with the "enthusiasm" of "a small number of people" for the "defects" in our work. But who is this "small number of people"? Isn't it you? Isn't it you who commanded in the article that newspapers must "publish the defects and errors in our work, even if it is a minor problem, it should be published"? Isn't it you who were enthusiastic about exposing the so-called "darkness" and "black spots" of socialism? This is undeniable. Because of his share, in this article, he expressed unlimited sympathy for this "small number of people," saying what "we hope they will change their stance and first join the ranks of socialist construction with their hearts and souls." This is an exhortation to bankrupt right-opportunists to disguise themselves as "changing their stance" and infiltrate the revolutionary "ranks" to continue their anti-socialist tricks.

Deep-seated hatred for the proletariat, meticulous care for the bourgeoisie, this is Tao Zhu's "emotion." Stripped of the disguise, standing is such a demon.

Rotten literary style

Pretentious writing style, crooked and incomprehensible sentences, yet claiming to have "literary talent," it is truly hideous! It is just like those landlords who pretend to be cultured, who, although they know nothing, still shake their heads and sway their bodies to hum a few eight-legged essays.

Although there is no "literary talent," the book is full of effort in promoting a set of revisionist literary lines. Tao Zhu faithfully executed the reactionary literary program of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, and was completely in cahoots with Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang.

In the spring of 1960, the old Cultural Bureau's Xia Yan, Chen Yangmei, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, at the so-called "National Newsreel Film Creation Conference," circulated the poisonous weed "Thought, Emotion, and Literary Talent" as a conference document for everyone to "study." This shows how deeply they colluded. To oppose Chairman Mao's literary line, Tao Zhu almost collected all the reactionary viewpoints circulating in the literary world, such as the theory of human nature, the theory of "writing reality," the theory of "creative freedom," the theory of "intermediate characters," the theory of "ghosts are harmless"...

Below are a few examples, with brief refutations:

"Communist Party members are emotional... except for counter-revolutionaries, one should have emotions for everyone." In a class society, there is only class emotion, not some super-class emotion. Here, "emotion" refers to "love." "Having emotions for everyone" is the modern revisionism of "loving everyone," which is to love the exploiting class, love traitors, love lackeys, love those who walk the capitalist road. This is the most shameful act of kneeling before the reactionaries.

"We should fully give play to the freedom of writers' creation. The pen of a writer is his own, and the thoughts of a writer are his own. We should let writers create independently." This is the naked revolutionary slogan of the Petofi Club. There is no abstract freedom, only concrete freedom. In a class society, there is only class freedom, not super-class freedom. All literary creation serves the politics of a certain class. There is no and cannot be literature that is "free" from class politics. Anyone, including writers, no matter what special form their thoughts take, are not some isolated "own thoughts," but are the expression of the thoughts of a certain class, the expression of the interests and desires of a certain class, the reflection of certain social class relations. Do seven hundred million Chinese people have seven hundred million kinds of "own thoughts"? Of course not, basically there are only two kinds: one is the worldview of the proletariat, that is, Mao Zedong Thought; the other is the worldview of the bourgeoisie, that is, various forms of bourgeois individualism. Any "creative freedom" and "independent creation" apart from Mao Zedong Thought is to incite ghosts and demons to "freely" attack socialism and propagate capitalism, while depriving the revolutionary proletariat of the freedom to counterattack, serving the evil deeds of capitalist restoration. What "creative freedom" is, is just a fig leaf for those who are determined to be slaves of the bourgeoisie!

"Life is multifaceted, not confined to one format, do not draw a frame." This is the so-called "anti-theory of subject matter determination," whose purpose is to oppose the "frame" under the pretext of opposing "frames," to oppose revolutionary writers' efforts to reflect the class struggle of the socialist era, to oppose efforts to sing the praises of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to oppose efforts to create proletarian heroes. "Life is multifaceted," in fact, it is mainly two aspects: one aspect is the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of laboring people under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, pushing history forward; the other aspect is the rotten and reactionary life of the bourgeoisie resisting the advance of history. We should take the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries who truly understand their historical responsibility as the main body, direction, and center of singing and depicting, through such typical heroic figures, to reflect our unprecedented heroic era, to reflect the great power and great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Those rotten and reactionary lives of the bourgeoisie can only be objects of criticism, lashing, and exposure, and cannot be the main "aspects" of creation. "Not confined to one format," there is always a format. The "life" in your mind is actually those bourgeois vulgar emotions and decadent tunes that you praise to no end in "Three Lane Alley," which are some rotten dregs in the historical garbage dump. Isn't this clear?

"Literary works, as long as they truly reflect reality... I think, its effect is sometimes not inferior to editorials and reports." This is a direct copy of Hu Feng's "theory of writing reality." Any image created in literary works expresses the political tendency of the author, expresses the class love and hate of the author. There is no abstract, neutral "truly reflecting reality." Proletarian revolutionaries are thorough materialists. Thorough materialists are fearless. Only by standing on the side of the proletariat can one truly reflect the essence of historical progress. The reactionary literature of the bourgeoisie and revisionism distorts workers, peasants, and soldiers, distorts reality, which is the inevitable result of their reactionary historical idealist worldview. Advocating abstract "writing reality" is to oppose literary propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose literary education of the people with communist spirit, to erase and cover up the class nature of literature, to find a "theoretical" basis for those big poisonous weeds that beautify the exploiting class and vilify the proletariat. This is already the most rotten and outdated commodity in the bourgeois literary arsenal.

"One can see the good aspects, and one can also see the bad aspects... one should allow works to write about defects... one should not give people the impression that to sing the praises of people's communes, one must say that people's communes are very good at once." This is the "theory of exposing darkness," which is a reactionary theory that Chairman Mao has long condemned as "light and darkness are equal, half and half." We should distinguish between the mainstream and the side currents in life. Only by grasping the mainstream can one typically reflect the essence of social progress. Side currents can only be a kind of accompaniment to the mainstream, a means of expressing the essence, a secondary aspect of the whole, a temporary and partial twist in the process of progress, and cannot be the main content of life. We should take singing the praises of the great victories of socialist revolution and construction, that is, the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, as the main focus, take reflecting the earth-shaking heroic spirit and fighting wisdom of proletarian revolutionary warriors as the main focus, take creating the heroic figures of our era as the main focus, rather than some "good aspects" and "bad aspects" being half and half. To write about people's communes, of course, one should fully sing the praises of the superiority of people's communes. Do we still need to list all the defects and errors in the process of development? There is a song called "People's Communes Are Good," do we still need to add a sentence "People's Communes Have Defects"? Exaggerating, embellishing, and maliciously fabricating those partial and individual phenomena is an old trick of imperialism, revisionism, and the bourgeoisie to spread rumors and slander. This old rightist is just copying the trick. To sing the praises of light as the main focus, do we need to avoid contradictions? Do we need to avoid the struggles and counterattacks of the enemy? Do we need to reduce the sharpness of the conflict? No. Society advances through class struggle. The revolutionary forces of the proletariat always open up the road of progress through fierce struggle with the counter-revolutionary forces of the bourgeoisie. Only through the typical historical generalization of class contradictions and class struggle can one deeply and not superficially, majestically and not weakly, write out the light, victory, and heroic figures. Tao Zhu's "theory of exposing darkness" will, together with his dark soul, be swept into the historical garbage dump by the revolutionary people.

Identifying Khrushchev-style careerists

From the above several aspects, one can easily see that Tao Zhu is a big rightist who escaped the net, a revisionist, a loyal executor and propagandist of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by China's Khrushchev, a counter-revolutionary two-faced person who infiltrated. The poisonous weeds sold in the book must be thoroughly disinfected.

Tao Zhu is a Khrushchev-style careerist. He stubbornly insists on the political direction of capitalism. He hates socialism extremely. He yearns for capitalism day and night. From politics, culture to life, his "ideals" are all about restoring capitalism in China. His head is full of reactionary worldviews of the exploiting class, from the philosophy of traitors to "die for the one who knows you." However, in order not to be exposed under the dictatorship of the proletariat, he has to wrap himself in a revolutionary cloak to disguise himself. This person is extremely dishonest. Two-faced, boastful, sometimes passionate, sometimes evasive, is his usual performance. However, as long as it is on the fundamental issue of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road, using the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to take a look, this disguise will immediately be exposed, and the true colors will be revealed. These two books are not the iron-clad evidence of taking the capitalist road?

All Khrushchev-style careerists are conspirators who usurp the party. They use various conspiratorial means to expand the power of a small handful of revisionists, shamelessly blowing their own horns to oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose the proletarian revolutionaries. Tao Zhu threw out these two books, not only to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, but also as a means to expand the power of this small handful of revisionists. There is an article in the book called "Preface to the Discussion of Western Journey," which was originally called "Record of Accompanying Discussion." It is about him taking a few black literati to "accompany" him to travel around, and then he talks nonsense, and the black literati record it as if it were a decree, embellish it, and publish it in the newspaper. "Record of Discussion" is to "record" his "discussion." In this way, twenty-seven articles were obtained! They were all published! They were named, preface, and titled by him! This is not clearly trying to be the "Southern Tyrant"? "Ideals" and "Thought" are full of this kind of self-boasting of power when propagating those reactionary viewpoints. He wants to use these "works" as public opinion preparation to seize power from the proletarian headquarters. After Tao Zhu went from the local to the central government, his hand reached so far, and his fervor to seize power from the proletariat was so prominent in a few months, using all means to win over and buy those who had been exposed by the revolutionary people, resisting the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, suppressing the revolutionaries, to the extent that any two-faced trick cannot cover up this counter-revolutionary ambition. From this negative example, can we not find an important lesson in identifying Khrushchev-style characters?

Tao Zhu is a despicable pragmatist. He has the mouth of a speculator. To promote revisionism, to attack and oppose the so-called "dogmatism," that is, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, he sometimes shows extreme rightism, sometimes pretends to be extremely "left," to corrupt, confuse, and deceive those unstable intermediate masses, to protect himself from being exposed. After Tao Zhu took the lead in the Propaganda Department of the Party, he was the faithful executor of the Party's number one capitalist-roader in suppressing the revolutionary masses. He strenuously opposed Chairman Mao's great big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." He strenuously protected those demons and ghosts. However, when the masses rose up to criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, he suddenly transformed himself, immediately appearing in the guise of extreme "left" anarchism, shouting loudly: "In the Cultural Revolution, doubting everything is correct," "every headquarters does not know what kind of headquarters it is... I advocate general bombardment!" "Anyone can oppose!" He greatly "creatively" "developed" the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie of "striking a large area and protecting a small handful." It seems extremely "left," but it is actually "left" in form and right in essence. The purpose is still to confuse the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, to direct the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, so that a small handful of capitalist-roaders can pass through the noise. What "doubt everything," is all used to deal with the proletarian headquarters. "Doubt everything," does not doubt oneself; "overthrow everything," does not overthrow oneself, isn't it strange? Please pay attention, comrades: Now, a small handful of counter-revolutionaries also use this method. They use the appearance of extremely "left" but essentially extremely right slogans to stir up the wind of "doubt everything," bombard the proletarian headquarters, sow discord, fish in troubled waters, and try to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to achieve their unspeakable evil purposes. The organizers and manipulators of the so-called "May 16" are such a conspiratorial counter-revolutionary organization. It should be thoroughly exposed. The deceived and uninformed young people should come to their senses, turn around, and do not be fooled. The purpose of this counter-revolutionary organization is twofold: one is to sabotage and split the leadership of the Party Central Committee led by our great leader Mao Zedong; the other is to sabotage and split the main pillar of the proletarian dictatorship—the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. This counter-revolutionary organization does not dare to appear in public. For several months, they have been hiding underground in Beijing. Their members and leaders are mostly still unclear. They only come out at night to paste leaflets and write slogans. For such characters, the broad masses are investigating and studying, and soon they will be clear. For such characters, as long as we use the method of class analysis taught by Chairman Mao, look at their attitude towards the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, look at their political tendency of supporting whom and opposing whom, look at their history, we can find a counter-revolutionary black hand from the ever-changing image. The more they try to cover up the exposed part, the more they seem to be particularly "extreme" or "fair," the more they expose their careerist face, just like Tao Zhu, this revisionist, who is clearly a thief but pretends to be a saint, clearly extreme rightist, openly declaring to be "heart to heart" with the bourgeoisie, but suddenly jumps to the extreme "left" of "doubt everything." However, the spearhead is always aimed at the proletarian revolutionaries, which exposes his careerist face clearly.

The deepening of class struggle and the victory of the proletarian revolutionaries force the enemy to constantly change their fighting strategies. When one counter-revolutionary conspiracy is exposed, the enemy will use another trick, alternating between them. However, these scoundrels cannot escape the keen eyes of Mao Zedong Thought. In the current situation of victory, we must pay great attention to the direction of the struggle, pay great attention to maintaining the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, pay great attention to executing the unified battle deployment of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, pay great attention to grasping policies and strategies, pay great attention to uniting the majority, and pay great attention to not letting Tao Zhu-style characters disrupt our ranks from the right or "left" or both sides at the same time. The left makes mistakes, the right takes advantage, it has always been like this. In the great criticism, through summing up the historical experience of class struggle, we should understand this point more deeply.

In the fifth chapter of "Dream of the Red Chamber," there is a song called "Wisdom is Tiring," the first two lines are:

"Too clever by half, it brings one's own doom!" All those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and think they are "clever" Khrushchev-style careerists, in the dark, play many tricks, until Tao Zhu invented the famous "head-swapping" trick (that is, to oppose the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, in the photo, highlight the second number of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, just cut his head and paste it on someone else's body), it can be said to be the pinnacle, but in the end, it is only lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot, creating conditions for one's own downfall. The small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Wuhan area are also such simple-minded, reactionary fools. Those who play tricks have no good ending. When the broad masses come together, no evil can be hidden. Those revisionist scoundrels who oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will inevitably fall, this is the judgment of history. No matter how this small handful of Khrushchev-style careerists struggle and argue, they will never escape this judgment of history.

The great tide of the proletarian cultural revolution rolls forward. The golden light of Mao Zedong Thought shines over all of China and the world. The proletarian revolutionaries of China are brave, the revolutionary people of China are brave. We will definitely carry this great revolution to the end. The counter-attacks, attacks, rumors, and instigations from a small handful of capitalist-roaders, the slanders, distortions, defamations, and shouts from imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists cannot stop our advance, but can only prove their own extreme stupidity and desperate situation. Comrades, raise your hands and cheer for this great storm that cleanses the land of China! Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. The power of the people is boundless. The new things of the revolution are irresistible. People will see: after this great and tortuous road of the Cultural Revolution, a unprecedentedly strong, solid, and united great socialist China under the proletarian dictatorship will stand tall in the East, giving the twentieth-century cannibals a heavier blow.

　　评陶铸的两本书
　　姚文元
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，如阵阵疾风骤雨，震荡着全中国，震撼着全世界。
      形势大好。从文化领域中的大批判开始的无产阶级文化大革命，经过了一年激动人心的战斗，现在正胜利地进入对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的群众性的大批判。这个大批判具有重大的政治意义，它是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的深入发展，是清除修正主义毒素的重大步骤，是动员千百万群众投入斗、批、改的思想动力，是在政治、经济、文化、军事各个方面深入贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一场声势浩大的群众性的斗争。
    放在我们面前的这两本书：一九六二年中国青年出版社出版的《理想，情操，精神生活》（简称《理想》），和一九六四年广东人民出版社出版的《思想·感情·文采》（简称《思想》），就是我们展开大批判极好的反面教材。它们是黑《修养》的“姊妹篇”，活龙活现地刻划出陶铸这个修正主义者的反动而丑恶的灵魂。
    在八届十一中全会之前，陶铸是以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线忠实的执行者。在八届十一中全会之后，当两个最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动面目被全党揭穿之后，他就成为继续执行资产阶级反动路线的主要代表人物。他伙同他的心腹反革命修正主义分子王任重之流，继续疯狂地反对和歪曲以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，反对和抵制伟大的毛泽东思想，招降纳叛，勾结党内走资本主义道路的当权派，到处发指示压制革命群众，支持、包庇反革命修正主义分子和牛鬼蛇神，妄图用卑劣的手段，掩盖和推翻党的八届十一中全会对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判。
    历史的前进，总是使那些过高估计反动派力量、过低估计人民力量、昏头昏脑地想把自己装成“英雄”的倒行逆施的人物，很快成为令人嗤笑的小丑。一九六六年七月三十日，当这位自吹为“基本上是无产阶级革命家”的人物，在万人大会上，飞扬跋扈地向群众挥拳吼叫“你们如果不相信我，也可以把我搞垮嘛”的时候，他是多么自傲啊！简直要吃人！他是想以此来恐吓群众：谁敢反对他这个“老革命”，谁就要倒霉，而他这个“英雄”是绝对“垮”不了的。但是，历史的逻辑就是这样：谁跳出来反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对无产阶级文化大革命，反对广大革命人民，谁就一定要垮台。越是表演得充分的反动派，垮得就越彻底。回头去看，他的自我标榜、威吓群众的丑态，只不过在两面派的脸谱上增加了一道令人发笑的油彩而已。
    “我是一贯革命的。”好，我们就用这两本书为主要材料，看一看这个“一贯革命”的人物到底“一贯”跟谁走，是在“革”什么“命”，到底在坚持什么“理想”，在鼓吹什么“情操”，在宣扬哪一个阶级的“思想感情”，在过着一种什么样的“精神生活”。
    资产阶级反革命派的“理想”
    陶铸是那一“派”？书中鼓吹的“理想”是那一派的“理想”？只要看看他的自画招供就足够了：
    一九五五年八月，正当对农业、手工业的社会主义改造进入高潮，无产阶级同资产阶级进行你死我活斗争的时候，陶铸跳出来拍着胸膛宣布：“我们大家都是一派，这一派叫做中国人民派，除了反革命分子以外，大家都要很亲切地团结起来”①。
  “除了反革命分子以外”的“大家”是一分为二的：无产阶级为一方，资产阶级为一方。陶铸恶毒地诬蔑对知识分子的思想改造是“侮辱人格”，胡说什么胡适的反动思想仅仅是属于“思想方法问题”，“等三十年、四十年”以后“才看得清楚”②，很明显，他说的“我们大家”，指的是资产阶级及其代理人胡适之流的人物。陶铸所吹嘘的要“很亲切地”拥抱在一起的什么“中国人民派”，实际上就是反人民的资产阶级反动派。
    在同一个报告中，陶铸还无限同情地说：“目前大陆上潜伏的反革命分子的处境是可怜的，心情是痛苦的”，言为心声，一个“可怜”，一个“痛苦”，一笔勾销了反革命分子的可恨和残暴，把他同反革命分子心心相印的“精神生活”，活活地刻划了出来。这样精彩的“表态”，在收入本书时作为“摘要”以外的部分被删去了。
    过了两年，一九五七年五月，正当右派猖狂进攻的时候，陶铸立刻在报上写文章大叫大喊，“现在阶级已经基本消灭”，“国内敌我矛盾已经解决”，无产阶级专政的“专政职能要减弱”，要“转”到“领导生产”“组织人民的经济生活”方面去③。地主、富农、资产阶级，统统成了一个“大家庭”中的人，无产阶级专政可以取消，只管“领导生产”的“全民国家”即可实现。这种推翻无产阶级专政的彻头彻尾的修正主义腔调，完全是一付资产阶级右派头目的嘴脸。
    再过两年，一九五九年上半年，正当社会主义革命进一步深入的时候，陶铸在《松树的风格》中，鼓吹“永不屈服于恶劣环境”④；在《革命的坚定性》中鼓吹什么要“面对大海”，经得起“狂风暴雨的侵袭”⑤。轰轰烈烈的大跃进，革命人民改造世界的英雄壮志，被他叫做“恶劣的环境”；社会主义革命的风暴打击了资产阶级和地富反坏右以及他们的代理人彭德怀反党集团，他却狂叫“要经得起狂风暴雨的打击”。不须多加一字，反革命立场昭然若揭。
    再过六年，到了一九六五年。在伟大的八届十中全会之后，毛主席多次提出了国内的主要矛盾是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，并且在关于社会主义教育运动的“二十三条”中提出了“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。中国的赫鲁晓夫及陶铸之流，则发狂地反对和抵抗毛主席的这些重要指示。一九六五年十一月，正当批判《海瑞罢官》刚开始，一场同反革命修正主义分子、中国的赫鲁晓夫的生死搏斗迫在眉睫的时刻，陶铸在反革命文艺黑线的喉舌《文艺报》上又一次“亮相”。他说：“我认为，在现阶段，应当把反映人民内部矛盾的任务，摆到最重要的位置上来。”⑥说什么“现阶段”的主要矛盾是“人民内部矛盾”，这是公然抹杀国内的主要矛盾是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，把一小撮反革命分子、叛徒、右派分子、走资本主义道路的当权派，都当做“人民内部”的问题，掩盖他们篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶，好把钻进党内的一批穷凶极恶的资产阶级反革命派统统包庇下来。
    什么“一贯革命”？一贯的反革命！可以说，每个历史关键时刻，他都公开地站在资产阶级立场上反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对社会主义。吹得五花八门的什么“理想”，就是资产阶级反革命派的理想，是保护和发展资本主义的反动理想，是在中国推翻无产阶级专政、实现资本主义复辟的痴心妄想。
    请看：
    其一曰：“社会主义思想，就是要用一切办法去保证国家迅速工业化”⑦。照这种反动透顶的“社会主义”理论，岂不是工业化了的美国早就实现了“社会主义”了吗？搞“工业化”，有社会主义和资本主义两条道路，两条路线，两种“办法”。走社会主义道路，就要依靠工人阶级和广大革命群众，依靠突出政治，依靠毛泽东思想所唤起的亿万人民的革命觉悟和革命积极性，使企业的领导权真正掌握在无产阶级革命派手里；走资本主义道路，就是书中反复鼓吹的依靠少数资产阶级“专家”，依靠“物质刺激”，依靠保守派，使企业的领导权为代表资产阶级利益的特权阶层所篡夺。所谓用“一切办法”，就是要用依靠资产阶级的办法来发展资本主义的剥削制度，抗拒对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
      “中国过去一百多年的历史，尽是挨打的历史，原因就是自己没有工业”⑧。陶铸俨然以一个蹩脚的历史教师的口吻向我们讲一篇中国近代史，当然是颠倒了的历史。从一八四○年到一九四九年，这一百零九年，中国人所以“挨打”，主要并不是因为没有工业，而是因为政权掌握在帝国主义的走狗即从清朝政府、北洋军阀到蒋介石这些卖国贼手里。自从中国的无产阶级和劳动人民在伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导下夺取了全国政权，帝国主义再想打我们，就得先想想自己的猪爪子有多硬。文化大革命越搞得彻底，毛泽东思想越是深入人心，无产阶级专政越巩固，打起仗来就越无敌于天下。这就是无产阶级革命派的“理想”。把过去“挨打”统统归诸“没有工业”，这就把那些罪大恶极的卖国贼的罪行统统掩盖了，这就美化了那些在“发展工业”幌子下复辟资本主义的国际资产阶级在中国的走狗，这是同中国的赫鲁晓夫一模一样的卖国主义腔调！
    其二曰：“共产主义理想”就是“舒适的房子”，就是“使所有的房间在晚上都亮起电灯，使所有的人都穿上整齐漂亮的衣裳，出门都能坐汽车……”⑨一句话，就是“吃得好、穿得好、住得好”。就是享乐主义。什么人给他“吃得好，住得好”，他就可以出卖自己灵魂，而且还可以廉价奉送一顶“共产主义”的帽子。真是最卑鄙的叛徒哲学！“共产主义”的外衣，极端个人主义即资本主义的本质，这就是陶铸所谓“共产主义理想”的定义。照这个定义，美国资产阶级生活岂不是最符合“共产主义理想”了吗？
    其三曰：“崇高的理想”就是念念不忘地“想着自己将来成为航海家、飞行家、科学家、文学家、工程师、教师……”⑩家、家、家，就是没有工、农、兵。在这个无产阶级的叛徒眼中，革命的工人，农民，战士，地位都应当摆得很“低”，岂但低，简直应当打进地狱，压在最低层，永世不得翻身。而摆得很高很高以至极其“崇高”的，是那些一大串资产阶级的“家”。“资产阶级参加过民主运动，他们搞工业有知识，不比地主那么腐败”?。对了，这就招供出你这些“家”，并不是无产阶级的专门家，而是资产阶级及其在文化界的代表人物。你所谓的“知识”，就是资本家如何巧妙而残酷地剥削工人之类的知识。陶铸的“崇高理想”就是通过这一批爬得很“高”的资产阶级代表人物，实行反革命复辟。今天，一批很“高”的资产阶级“权威”被革命小将拉下来了。
    还有一种：伟大的理想，就是所谓要“真正做到大家心情舒畅”。一九六二年，正当资产阶级向无产阶级发动了猖狂进攻，妖魔乱舞，毒草丛生的时刻，为了资产阶级能“心情舒畅”，陶铸在《对繁荣创作的意见》一文中，就胡说什么资产阶级知识分子“有不少人已经是属于劳动人民的知识分子了”、“一定要发挥劳动知识分子的积极性。”?（按：查陶铸的报告原文为：“绝大多数知识分子现在已经是属于劳动人民的知识分子，应该给脱下资产阶级知识分子的帽子。”）好呵！什么“三家村”，什么田汉、夏衍、吴晗、翦伯赞，什么海瑞、魏征、李慧娘之流，统统“属于劳动人民知识分子”了，他们经过这一番脱帽加冕，不是就可以更“起劲”地为资本主义复辟准备舆论了吗？乐陶陶地“大家很融洽、很舒畅”，不就可以舒舒服服地搞资本主义复辟了吗？
    无产阶级同资产阶级，总有一家不“舒畅”，这是阶级斗争的必然。无产阶级心情“舒畅”之日，就是资产阶级倒霉之时。资产阶级心情“舒畅”之时，就是无产阶级痛苦之日。二者必居其一。为资产阶级不“舒畅”而喊冤叫屈的人，只能证明他自己是同资产阶级共呼吸的。
    陶铸说：他这种“社会主义理想”是“对所有的人”包括资产阶级“都是有好处的”。社会主义就是通过无产阶级专政来彻底消灭资产阶级，怎么会对资产阶级“有好处”呢？所谓“对所有的人都是有好处”的“社会主义”，是假社会主义，是赫鲁晓夫式的修正主义，是布哈林的资本主义可以“长入”社会主义的反革命理论，是取消阶级斗争、取消无产阶级专政的“全民党”“全民国家”“全民社会主义”的反动理论，是社会主义在中国取得伟大胜利之后复辟资本主义的口号。
    够了！上述这些材料，已足够使我们看清楚这位资产阶级代理人的真面目。他坚持的是一条反社会主义的资本主义道路。他爱的、想的、颂的是资本主义，他恨的、怕的、骂的是社会主义。这些文章中的“理想”，一言以蔽之，就是要以资产阶级的丑恶面貌来改造国家，改造社会，改造党。
    这位人物有一句“名言”：“确立社会主义思想”或理想，就是“起码也要使社会主义思想占整个思想的百分之五十几以上”?。人的世界观怎么可以用百分比来计算呢？真是荒谬绝伦。拆穿了，其实是一场十分拙劣的大骗局。这是在告诉资产阶级以伪装的形式出现，把“百分之五十”的语言披上“社会主义思想”的外衣，来掩盖资本主义的丑恶本质。这是最典型的修正主义。这两本书就是用此法写出的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派说过这样向资产阶级“交心”的话：“资产阶级”只要“学会马克思主义”词句，就可以“眉笑眼开”地“和平进入社会主义”，名、利双收。这就是所谓“百分之五十几”的“社会主义思想”最好的注解。“理想”！“理想”！资产阶级看见这样忠实的代理人，真要感激涕零了。
    叛徒加奴才的“精神生活”
    你要知道这两本书中宣扬一种什么“精神生活”吗？不须多看，取其“精华”就够了。这就是——国民党的反动哲学加上奴才的“思想”。
    陶铸对于国民党的那些极其腐朽反动的唯心论，以及刽子手蒋介石的黑话，是记得很牢，背得很熟的。这些反革命的货色在他“精神生活”中占有头等重要的位置。只有叛徒的嘴巴里才吐得出这样反动的东西。
    蒋介石在其反革命言论中说过：“讲到政治的意义，总理已经明白告诉我们：‘政’就是众人的事，‘治’就是管理，管理众人的事便是‘政治’。……所以‘政治’的意义：就是要达到全国总动员之科学的方法，来管理众人的事，而为整个国家和全体民众谋最大的福利。”?
    陶铸原封不动地搬过来说：“首先要了解什么是政治。大家大概都知道孙中山先生吧，他说过：‘政就是众人的事，治就是管理，管理众人的事，就是政治。’……我们‘管理众人的事’是为了使国家富强、人民幸福……就是为人民谋利益的事，讲清道理，使大家懂得道理，心悦诚服地来参加建设社会主义社会的工作。”?
    陶铸无耻地说过：他是蒋介石的“学生”。更准确一些，是奴才。你看他这种言论象不象奴才！？
    把政治叫做“管理众人之事”，这是资产阶级剥削者的反动观点。没有抽象的“众人”，“众人”在阶级社会里，是划分为阶级的。也没有什么抽象的“管理”，“管理”在阶级社会中，总是处理阶级之间的关系，是哪一个阶级掌握和运用政权的问题。毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中十分深刻地指出：“政治，不论革命的和反革命的，都是阶级对阶级的斗争”?。用毛主席这个观点去分析，政治，就是为巩固或推翻这一阶级或那一阶级的政权而斗争；为保护或摧毁这一种所有制或那一种所有制而斗争；为夺取或维护这一阶级（集团）的利益或那一阶级（集团）的利益而斗争。无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己，因此，无产阶级推翻资产阶级压迫、建立和巩固无产阶级专政的政治斗争，就不但代表了本阶级的利益，而且代表了广大劳动人民的利益。而资产阶级为了掩盖它政治活动的阶级内容，掩饰资产阶级对无产阶级和劳动人民的压迫和剥削，就把反革命政治抽象地说成是“管理众人之事”，这是从十八世纪的资产阶级直到搞“全民国家”的苏联现代修正主义者共同的手法。蒋介石所谓“管理众人”，就是血腥地使用反革命的国家机器去镇压和屠杀广大的劳动人民，把地主、资产阶级的反革命统治，说成是“为整个国家和全体民众谋幸福”，还要用什么“总动员”去欺骗，卑鄙无耻到了极点。而奴才陶铸搬出这一套，则是要实现反革命的资本主义复辟，取消无产阶级对资产阶级的专政，把为资产阶级及一切反动派利益效劳的奴才行为，说成是“为人民谋利益”，还要用什么“讲清道理”去欺骗，同样是卑鄙到了极点。
    蒋介石在其反革命言论中鼓吹什么“亲爱精诚的精神”，鼓吹什么“先知先觉”。陶铸原封不动地用上了：
    “我们并不完全否认孙中山先生的所谓‘先知先觉’、‘后知后觉’的说法，社会上是有这种情况的：有些人进步快一些，有些人进步慢一些，只要他有上进之心，终归是可以进步的……”?；
    “马克思主义者应要求人宽，要求己严……对党外人士不是要求很高，应象孙中山讲的‘精诚团结’……。”?
      “先知先觉”“后知后觉”的说法是抽去了阶级内容、脱离社会实践的历史唯心论的反动观点。毛主席指出：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”?那些死不回头的反革命修正主义分子，那些累教不改的走资本主义道路的死硬派，并不是因为他们什么“后知后觉”，而是因为他们的社会存在即资产阶级的阶级地位决定了他们顽固地要走资本主义道路。美帝国主义杀人犯和苏共叛徒集团也并不是因为他们缺少“上进之心”，而是因为他们是反动资产阶级的代表，他们所执行的路线不管有多少花招，只能是为美国垄断资产阶级和苏联资产阶级特权阶层服务的反革命路线。无产阶级革命派所以能够冲破重重障碍、突破党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的各种沉重的以至残酷的压迫而取得胜利，并不是因为他们“先知先觉”，而是因为他们掌握了毛泽东思想，掌握了这个集中了中国和世界无产阶级最高智慧的理论武器，代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的利益，所以能越战越强，万难不屈，永远保持旺盛的革命乐观主义。今天陶铸吹捧这种反动的唯心论，是要使人们相信资产阶级“终归可以进步”，麻痹人民的革命警惕，帮助资产阶级混进无产阶级内部进行破坏。
    陶铸所谓的“精诚团结”，纯粹是国民党反动派的语言！同一个词汇，不同的阶级赋予不同的解释。我们偶而也用这个词，那是指在一定革命目标下的团结，为实现无产阶级的革命任务而斗争。我们从来是讲：在社会主义方向下的团结，在马列主义、毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结。然而陶铸所谓的“精诚团结”，却是抛弃原则、背叛社会主义方向、适合资产阶级要求的“精诚团结”！团结和斗争是统一体的两个相互矛盾着的侧面，没有斗争，也就无所谓团结。团结是相对的、过渡的，斗争是绝对的。世界上的事物，总是在发展中一分为二，人们的认识，总是在斗争中发展的。正如毛主席指出的：“马克思主义必须在斗争中才能发展，不但过去是这样，现在是这样，将来也必然还是这样。”?哪里有陶铸那种永恒不变的“精诚团结”。算命先生挂出一块牌子说：“诚则灵”，那是骗人的把戏。蒋介石用什么“精诚团结”掩盖内部的狗咬狗，作为灌输法西斯思想的工具，陶铸则破天荒地挂上“马克思主义”的招牌，用来瓦解无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争。
      书中还说：“一九二五——二七年大革命初期之所以能获得胜利，是由于孙中山先生改组国民党，实行三大政策，‘顺应’了当时革命的客观规律”?。把一九二五年至一九二七年第一次国内革命战争初期的胜利，不是归于以毛泽东同志为代表的中国共产党的正确领导和正确政策，不是归于革命人民的斗争，而是统统归于国民党，这完全歪曲历史，颠倒是非，站在国民党反动派的立场上说话。把无数革命烈士的鲜血所换来的胜利果实送给国民党作捧场，这不是叛徒的腔调是什么？
    够了！够了！这些肮脏的言论，难道不是暴露出陶铸“精神生活”深处是一个国民党反动哲学的世界吗？
    除了国民党反动哲学外，剩下的“思想”完全是黑《修养》中的垃圾。
      《理想》一书不是欺骗青年说，什么“个人利益和集体利益是不可分的”，只要装做“把工作做好”，就会得到“重视”“器重”“赞扬”以至“闻名全中国、全世界”吗？这是中国的赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏占大便宜”的投机商的市侩哲学原封不动的翻版。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一九六○年二月接见民建会、工商联常务委员时，对资产阶级的代表人物献策说：“全心全意为人民服务，个人利益就会来。”?这句话相当精练地总结了这个资产阶级野心家几十年“做人”的经验，概括了这个无产阶级的叛徒人生哲学的“精髓”。什么“为人民服务”，什么“集体利益”，在他们这一小撮人统统是假的、骗人的，装出来给别人看的，是手段；而捞取“个人利益”、个人权力、个人享受则是真的，是目的，是丑恶灵魂的本质。这是资产阶级反革命两面派混进革命内部夺取权力的诡计。现在用来毒害青年一代，这种软刀子杀人的罪恶我们难道能容忍吗？   
      《理想》一书不是还欺骗青年说：“我们共同的世界观和共同的思想方法”“就是从客观实际出发的态度，是就是、非就非的态度”?吗？这也是从中国的赫鲁晓夫那里贩来的货色。在阶级社会中，是、非都有鲜明的阶级标准，所谓“实际”，首先就是阶级斗争的“实际”：你站在无产阶级一边，还是站在资产阶级一边？你站在帝国主义一边，还是站在革命人民一边？你站在马列主义、毛泽东思想一边，还是站在修正主义一边？你站在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部一边，还是站在反革命的资产阶级司令部一边？用抽象的“是非”来掩盖人们看问题时的阶级立场，是出卖灵魂的机会主义者的“共同的”特性。一九四九年五月，中国的赫鲁晓夫在报告他在天津向资产阶级屈膝跪拜的丑行时，恬不知耻地说：“资本家反映说我们的报纸不好，我说的确有点不大好，我也承认这个错误，……以后应该采取：是就是，非就非，好就好，坏就坏，……资本家有好就说好，工人不好就说不好”?。你看他多么“从实际出发”啊！“资本家有好就说好”“工人不好就说不好”，这是多么“公平”的法官啊！这个工贼的“是非”是多么鲜明啊！这个资产阶级的恶奴才对自己的主子的“好”处是多么念念不忘啊！他训斥工人“不好”的那种恶狠狠的神态又是多么清晰啊！而《理想》一书作者对某氏的出卖灵魂的哲学，真是背得熟透了啊！
    《理想》一书把“辩证唯物主义”歪曲成“存在第一、思维第二，客观第一、主观第二”?。完全抹杀人的主观能动作用，完全抹杀物质变精神、精神变物质的飞跃，完全抹杀实践——认识——再实践——再认识的人们认识发展的辩证过程。这决不是什么“辩证唯物论”，而是反动的形而上学。无产阶级认识客观世界的唯一目的，就在于按照事物本身的发展规律去改造客观世界。取消了改造客观世界，取消了革命，取消了推动历史前进的奋斗，“客观第一”岂不成了一纸空文！但仅仅这样批判，还是不够的，须知他之所以要宣传这种机械唯物论或庸俗唯物论，就是要宣传一种随波逐流、随时可以出卖无产阶级利益的机会主义，为资产阶级服务。不是吗？资产阶级也是一种“客观存在”，也可以从资产阶级出发，听资产阶级的话，以资产阶级利益为标准，“是就是，非就非”，于是搞资本主义复辟也可以冒充“实事求是”“辩证唯物主义”出现了。拆穿西洋镜，就是这么一个把戏。
    陶铸不是还眉飞色舞地向青年说：“世界上有男的，有女的，就会有恋爱”?吗？这立刻使人想起中国的赫鲁晓夫一句荒谬的“名言”：“一条牛加一条牛仍是牛……但是一条公牛加一条母牛就形成了新的关系，一个男人加一个女人便成了夫妻的关系。一切东西都必须是矛盾的统一体。”?在他们这一伙人看来，人和人的关系就是公牛同母牛的关系。在阶级社会里，人们是按阶级划分的、按阶级关系结合的。男女关系也不例外。鲁迅在《硬译与文学的阶级性》一文中就说过：“饥区的灾民，总不会去种兰花，象阔人的老太爷一样，贾府的焦大，也不爱林妹妹的。”这个基本事实，被他们抹杀了，践踏了。他们这种庸俗透顶的语言，不能够损害马克思主义阶级分析一根毫毛，只能反映出他们一伙心目中的相互关系及其“修养”，就是“公牛加母牛”“男人加女人”之类资产阶级的丑恶不堪的东西。君不见大谈“修养”的那一伙人，无一不是腐烂已极的伪君子吗？
      书中说，“一个人在几十年的生活中”决定其“成功与失败”，“就在于主观与客观的是否一致”?，你在国民党统治下究竟是怎样奴颜婢膝地把“主观”同“客观”去“一致”的，这“几十年”的“成功”中又是怎样同美帝国主义、国民党反动派、反革命资产阶级“一致”的，难道还不该拿到光天化日下来吗？
    对无产阶级刻骨仇恨的“感情”
　　一九五九年五月，正当修正主义分子彭德怀抛出他疯狂地复辟资本主义黑纲领的前夕，陶铸在《太阳的光辉》一文中，摆出一付“海瑞”的架式，公开地、恶毒地咒骂我们伟大的社会主义事业、伟大的党、伟大的领袖。他一面说，人们以“东方红，太阳升”“来形容我们伟大事业的朝气勃勃”，“以太阳来歌颂我们的党和领袖”；一面公然借攻击“太阳”的“过失”，指桑骂槐地说：“当大暑天骄阳似火，晒得人们流汗的时候，人们就会埋怨，说太阳的光和热发射得过份了。而且大家都知道并且也都指出过，太阳本身上还有黑点。”?
    “太阳本身上还有黑点”。这不是赤裸裸地咒骂我们的党和伟大的领袖吗？在你眼睛里，岂但是“黑点”，社会主义简直就是漆黑一团。用资产阶级的眼睛看问题的人，光明和黑暗是颠倒的。他们比瞎子还要瞎。在这位修正主义者看来，“太阳”的社会主义光辉晒得那些走资本主义道路的当权派受不了，现形了，“流汗了”，“过份了”，这就是“太阳”的“过失”所在。其实，这正是“太阳”伟大的地方。那些躲在阴暗角落里的牛鬼蛇神、臭虫虱子、细菌病毒，只有让它们见一见“太阳”的光和热，才会死亡；真正的劳动人民，正是在太阳光辉下锻炼得坚强起来的。不晒太阳，不流汗，身体怎么会健壮起来？咒骂“太阳”的“光和热”，其实就是咒骂无产阶级“过火了”，咒骂社会主义、人民公社“过份了”，这是十足的资产阶级的黑话，正好暴露自己是见不得阳光的鬼物。
    陶铸不是在《松树的风格》中赞美“松树”“在夏天它用自己的枝叶挡住炎炎烈日”?吗？毛泽东思想的阳光是抵挡不住的，硬要向光明宣战，只能使自己从黑暗中堕落进更黑暗的地方去。
    值得注意的是：一九六五年《理想》再版时，“以太阳来歌颂我们的党和领袖”这句话，忽然改成了“以太阳来歌颂我们伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。”这真是欲盖弥彰，绝妙地自我暴露出作贼心虚的贼子心肠！你删去“领袖”二字，岂不正说明了，一九五九年到一九六二年，你写这篇文章和出版这本书时，矛头是针对伟大的领袖的吗？如若不然，何必慌慌张张地删去？你在“党”前面添上“伟大的、光荣的、正确的”，岂不正说明
  了，一九五九年到一九六二年，你写这篇文章和出版这本书时，认为中国共产党不是伟大的、光荣的、正确的了吗？如若不然，何必急急忙忙地添上？心中有鬼，脸上变色，就这样手忙脚乱了。一九五九年五月，陶铸不是在汕头一次报告中大喊“要学习海瑞的风格”以配合彭德怀的进攻吗？看来这个“海瑞”的“风格”并不那么“高”，本事也很拙劣。然而这一改，配合彭德怀一伙，反党反社会主义反毛主席的罪行，却是不打自招，铁证如山，无可抵赖了。
    一九五九年九月下旬，庐山会议开过了，彭德怀反党集团被揭露了出来，修正主义分子的猖狂进攻被彻底粉碎了。这位修正主义者在《胜利得来不易》一文中，不得不装模作样地对“一小部分人”的“热衷于我们工作中的缺点”?表示了不满。可是，这“一小部分人”是谁呢？不就有你吗？不正是你在文章中命令报纸上必须“刊登我们工作中的缺点和错误，尽管这是一个指头的问题，也应该刊登”?吗？不就是你热衷于暴露社会主义的所谓“黑暗”“黑点”吗？这是赖不掉的。正因为有他一份，这篇文章中，他对这“一小部分人”表示了无限的同情，说什么“我们提起这些人，是希望他们转变立场，首先把身心都参加到社会主义建设的行列里来”?。这是劝告破了产的右倾机会主义分子伪装成“转变立场”，混进革命的“行列”中来继续干反社会主义的勾当。
    对无产阶级咬牙切齿的仇恨，对资产阶级无微不至的爱护，这就是陶铸的“感情”。剥去伪装的画皮，站着的就是这么一个恶鬼。
    腐朽不堪的“文采”
    装腔作势的文风，歪七歪八念都念不通的文字，硬要自封有什么“文采”，真是丑死了！活象那些附庸风雅的土地主，明明一窍不通，硬要摇头晃脑哼哼几句八股调一样。
    虽然没有什么“文采”，书中却十分卖力地宣扬了整套整套的修正主义的文艺路线。陶铸忠实地执行了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动文艺纲领，同陆定一，周扬完全是一丘之貉。
　　一九六○年春，旧文化部夏衍、陈荒煤等反革命修正主义分子在开所谓“全国新闻纪录电影创作会议”时，就把《思想·感情·文采》这棵大毒草作为大会文件印发给大家“学习”。可见他们勾结之深。为了反毛主席的文艺路线，陶铸几乎把文艺界流传的各种反动论点，什么人性论、“写真实”论、“创作自由”论、“中间人物”论、“有鬼无害”论……，统统收罗进他的黑店中。下面略举一二，稍加驳斥：
      “共产党员是讲感情的……除了反革命分子以外，对一切人都要有感情。”?在阶级社会里，只有阶级的感情，没有什么超阶级的感情。这里的“感情”指的是“爱”。“对一切人都要有感情”，就是现代修正主义的“要爱一切人”，就是要爱剥削阶级，爱叛徒，爱奴才，爱走资本主义道路的当权派，这是向反动派屈膝跪拜的最无耻的行径。
      “要充分发挥作家创作上的自由。作家的笔是他自己的，作家的思想也是他自己的，我们应该让作家独立创作。”?这是赤裸裸的裴多菲俱乐部的反革命口号。没有抽象的自由，只有具体的自由。在有阶级的社会里，只有阶级的自由，没有超阶级的自由。一切文艺创作，都是为一定的阶级的政治服务的。没有也不可能有脱离阶级的政治而“自由”的文艺。任何一个人，包括作家，他的思想不管具有何种特殊的形式，都不是什么孤立的“自己的思想”，而是一定阶级思想的表现，是一定阶级的利益、愿望的表现，是一定社会阶级关系的反映。七亿中国人民有七亿种“自己的”思想吗？当然不是，基本上只有两种，一种是无产阶级的世界观，即毛泽东思想；一种是资产阶级的世界观，即形形色色的资产阶级个人主义。离开毛泽东思想的什么“创作自由”，什么“独立创作”，就是鼓动牛鬼蛇神“自由”地去攻击社会主义，宣传资本主义，而剥夺无产阶级革命派反击他们的一切自由，为资本主义复辟的罪恶勾当服务。什么“创作自由”，不过是死心塌地当资产阶级奴才的一块遮羞布罢了！
      “生活是多方面的，不拘一格，不要划一个框框。”?这就是那个“反题材决定论”，其目的是在反对“框框”的借口下，反对革命作家努力去反映社会主义时代的阶级斗争，反对努力去歌颂工农兵，反对努力塑造无产阶级的英雄人物。“生活是多方面的”，其实主要是两个方面，一方面是无产阶级革命派和广大劳动人民在毛主席革命路线指引下的推动历史前进的革命斗争生活，一方面是资产阶级反动派抵抗历史前进的腐朽反动生活。我们应当以真正意识到自己历史责任的无产阶级革命派的斗争生活为主体，为方向，为歌颂和描绘的中心，通过这样的典型的英雄人物，来反映我们这个史无前例的英雄时代，来反映毛泽东思想的伟大力量和伟大胜利。那些资产阶级的反动腐朽生活，只能作为批判、鞭挞、揭露的对象，决不能作为创作的主要的“方面”。“不拘一格”，总有一格，你心目中的“生活”，其实就是你赞不绝口的《三家巷》中那些资产阶级的下流情绪和靡靡之音，是一些在历史的垃圾堆中霉烂了的渣滓，这难道还不清楚吗？
    文艺作品只要“真实地反映了现实，……我看，它的作用有时也不在社论与报告之下。”?这又是胡风“写真实”论原封不动的翻版。任何文艺作品所塑造的形象中，都表现着作者的政治的倾向性，表现着作者的阶级的爱和憎，没有什么抽象的、旁观的“真实地反映了现实”。无产阶级革命派是彻底的唯物主义者。彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的。只有站在无产阶级立场上，才能够从本质上真实地反映出历史的进程。资产阶级、修正主义的反动文艺歪曲工农兵、歪曲现实，则是它们反动的历史唯心主义世界观的必然结果。提倡抽象的“写真实”，就是要反对文艺宣传毛泽东思想，反对文艺用共产主义精神教育人民，抹杀和掩盖文艺的阶级性，替那些美化剥削阶级、丑化无产阶级的大毒草找一个“理论”根据。这已经是资产阶级文艺武库中最破烂最陈腐的货色了。
      “可以看好的方面，也可以看坏的方面，……要允许作品中写缺点……不要给人家一个印象，似乎要歌颂人民公社，就要把人民公社说得一下子好得很了。”?这就是“暴露黑暗”论，这是毛主席早就痛斥过的“光明与黑暗并重，一半对一半”的反动理论的翻版。我们应当区别生活中的主流和支流。只有抓住主流方面，才能典型地反映出社会前进的本质。支流只能作为主流的一种陪衬，作为表现本质的一种手段，作为全局的次要的侧面，作为前进过程中局部的、暂时的曲折，不能当作生活的主要内容。我们应当以写光明为主，以歌颂社会主义革命和建设的伟大胜利即毛泽东思想的伟大胜利为主，以反映无产阶级革命战士震天撼地的英雄气概和斗争智慧为主，以塑造我们时代的工农兵英雄形象为主，而不是什么“好的方面”“坏的方面”一半对一半。写人民公社，当然要充分歌颂人民公社的优越性，难道还需要把各种发展过程中的缺点错误统统罗列出来吗？有一支歌，叫“人民公社就是好”，难道还需要同时再加上一句“人民公社有缺点”吗？夸大、渲染和恶毒地捏造那些局部的、个别的现象，这是帝国主义、修正主义和资产阶级进行造谣诽谤的老谱，这位老右派不过依样画葫芦罢了。以歌颂光明为主需要回避矛盾吗？需要回避敌人的挣扎和反扑吗？需要降低冲突尖锐性吗？不需要。社会是在阶级斗争中前进的，无产阶级的革命力量总是在同资产阶级反革命力量剧烈斗争中开辟前进的道路的，只有通过对阶级矛盾、阶级斗争典型的历史概括，才能够深刻地而不是表面地、雄伟地而不是贫弱地把光明、胜利、英雄人物写出来。陶铸的“暴露黑暗”论，将同他黑暗的灵魂一起，被革命人民扫进历史的垃圾堆里去。
    要识别赫鲁晓夫式的野心家
    从以上的几个方面，人们不难看出，陶铸完全是一个漏网的大右派，是一个修正主义者，是以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线忠实的执行者和宣传者，是一个混进来的反革命两面派。对于书中贩卖的那一套国民党的反动哲学和其他毒素，要进行彻底的消毒。
    陶铸是一个赫鲁晓夫式的野心家。他顽固地坚持资本主义的政治方向。他极端仇恨社会主义，他日夜向往着资本主义。从政治上、文化上到生活上，他的“理想”都是在中国搞资本主义复辟。他头脑中装满了从叛徒哲学到“士为知己者死”之类剥削阶级反动的世界观。但是为了在无产阶级专政之下不被揭露，他不得不包上一点革命的外衣来伪装自己。此人极不老实。两面三刀，夸夸其谈，忽而慷慨激昂，忽而转弯抹角，是他的惯常的表演。但是，只要在走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路这个根本问题上，用毛泽东思想的照妖镜照一照，这种伪装就立刻会拆穿，原形就会毕现。这两本书，不就是走资本主义道路的铁证吗？
    凡是赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，都是篡党的阴谋家。他们为了反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级革命派，千方百计用各种阴谋手法扩大一小撮修正主义分子手中的权力，无耻地自我吹嘘。陶铸抛出这两本书，不但是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备，也是扩大他们一小撮修正主义分子权力的一种手段。书中有一篇文章，叫做《西行记谈序言》，这《西行记谈》原来叫做《随行记谈》，就是他带着几个黑秀才“随”着他出去四处游荡，然后他信口开河议论一番，黑秀才们就当作圣旨一样“记”下来，加以修饰，在报上发表。“记谈”，就是“记”他的“谈”话。这样，居然“共得二十七篇”！居然都拿出去发表！居然由他本人定名、作序、题字！这不是明明自己想当“南霸天”吗？《理想》及《思想》，在宣传那些反动观点时，充满了这类炫耀权力的自我吹嘘。他是要用这些“作品”，作为向无产阶级司令部夺权的舆论准备。陶铸从地方到中央之后，手伸得那样长，向无产阶级夺权的狂热在几个月中暴露得那样突出，不择手段地招降纳叛，收买已被革命人民揭露的坏人，抗拒以毛主席为首的党中央，打击革命派，以致任何两面派的手法也掩盖不住这种反革命野心。从这个反面教员中，我们不是可以找到识别赫鲁晓夫式人物的一个重要教训吗？
   陶铸是一个卑劣的实用主义者。他有一张投机商人的嘴巴。为了推销修正主义，为了攻击和反对所谓“教条主义”即马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，忽而显出极右，忽而装作极“左”，以腐蚀、迷惑和欺骗那些不坚定的中间群众，以保护自己不被揭露。陶铸在到中央宣传部担任领导工作以后，他是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派镇压革命群众的忠实执行者。他竭力反对毛主席《炮打司令部》这张伟大的大字报。他竭力保护那些牛鬼蛇神。可是当群众起来批判资产阶级反动路线时，他摇身一变，立刻以极“左”的无政府主义的面貌出现，大叫大喊：“在文化大革命中，怀疑一切是正确的”，“每个司令部都不知是什么司令部……我是主张普遍轰！”“任何人都可以反对”！他大大“创造性”地“发展”了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。看来“左”得出奇，其实是形“左”实右，其目的还是混淆无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的区别，把矛头引向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，使一小撮走资本主义道路当权派能在混乱声中蒙混过关。什么“怀疑一切”，统统是用来对付无产阶级司令部的。“怀疑一切”，就不怀疑他自己；“打倒一切”，就不打倒他自己，你说怪也不怪！？请同志们注意：现在有一小撮反革命分子也采用了这个办法，他们用貌似极“左”而实质极右的口号，刮起“怀疑一切”的妖风，炮打无产阶级司令部，挑拨离间，混水摸鱼，妄想动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，达到其不可告人的罪恶目的，所谓“五·一六”的组织者和操纵者，就是这样一个搞阴谋的反革命集团。应予以彻底揭露。受蒙蔽的、不明真相的青年人要猛省过来，反戈一击，切勿上当。这个反革命组织的目的是两个，一个是要破坏和分裂以我们的伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央的领导；一个是要破坏和分裂无产阶级专政的主要支柱——伟大的中国人民解放军。这个反革命组织，不敢公开见人，几个月来在北京藏在地下，他们的成员和领袖，大部分现在还不太清楚，他们只在夜深人静时派人出来贴传单，写标语。对这类人物，广大群众正在调查研究，不久就可以弄明白。对这类人物，只要用毛主席教导我们的阶级分析的方法，看一看他们对待资产阶级和无产阶级的态度，看一看他们支持谁、反对谁的政治倾向性，看一看他们的历史，便可以从变化不定的形象中发现一只反革命的黑手。他们越是要掩盖已经暴露的部分，貌似特别
  “过火”或“公平”，便越是更充分地暴露自己野心家的面貌，如陶铸这个修正主义者，明明是贼，偏要装圣贤，明明是极右的公开宣布同资产阶级“心连心”，偏要忽而跳到极“左”的“怀疑一切”。然而矛头却始终对着无产阶级革命派，这就把他野心家的面貌揭露得一清二楚了。
    阶级斗争的深入，无产阶级革命派的胜利，迫使敌人不断改变自己的斗争策略。当一种反革命阴谋被识破后，敌人又会使出另一手，交替而用之。然而这些败类是逃不过明察秋毫的毛泽东思想的。在当前胜利的形势下，我们必须十分注意斗争的大方向，十分注意维护以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，十分注意执行毛主席和党中央统一的作战部署，十分注意掌握政策和策略，十分注意团结大多数，十分注意不让陶铸式的人物从右的方面或“左”的方面或同时从两方面搅乱了我们的阵线。左派犯错误，右派利用，历来如此。在大批判中，通过总结阶级斗争的历史经验，我们是应当更深刻地懂得这一点的。
    《红楼梦》第五回里有一首曲子，叫做“聪明累”，头两句是：
  “机关算尽太聪明，反误了卿卿性命！”一切反毛泽东思想的自以为“聪明”的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，在暗底里玩弄了许多“机关”，一直到陶铸发明的“著名”的“换头术”（即为了反对八届十一中全会决议，在照片上突出第二号党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就把他的头像剪下来装到另一个人的身上），可算登峰造极了，但到头来不过是搬起石头砸自己的脚，为自己垮台创造了条件。武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也是这样一种头脑简单、思想反动的蠢人。玩弄阴谋的人是没有好下场的，广大群众一起来，什么坏事也隐藏不了。反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的修正主义坏蛋们必然垮台，这就是历史的判决。这一小撮赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，无论如何挣扎，如何诡辩，决计逃不过这个历史的判决。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。毛泽东思想的闪闪金光照耀着全中国、全世界。中国的无产阶级革命派是勇敢的，中国的革命的人民是勇敢的。我们一定要把这场大革命进行到底。来自一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反扑、攻击、造谣、挑拨，来自帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者的种种诬蔑、歪曲、诽谤、叫喊，决不能阻止我们的前进，只能够证明他们自己无比的愚蠢和日暮途穷。同志们，举起双手欢呼这涤荡中国大地的大风雨吧！毛泽东思想是无敌的。人民的力量是无穷无尽的。革命的新生事物是不可抗拒的。人们将会看见：经过文化大革命这段伟大而曲折的道路后，一个空前强大、巩固和统一的无产阶级专政的伟大的社会主义中国，将如巨人般屹立在世界的东方，给予二十世纪的吃人魔鬼们以更沉重的打击。
