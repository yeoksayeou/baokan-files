Nepali friends and writers recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, enthusiastically praising the unprecedented Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong.

Nepali friend Shreshta said, "The earth-shaking Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is the greatest event in world history." Shreshta emphasized that in the Soviet Union, because the question of who would win between socialism and capitalism was not resolved, as well as how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and how to prevent the restoration of capitalism, the likes of Khrushchev seized power in the Soviet Union. Learning from the bitter historical lessons of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, people will feel that China's proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. This revolution has added a new chapter to the history of the world proletariat.

He continued, "This revolution has confirmed Chairman Mao's assertion: in socialist society, classes and class struggle still exist." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the developed Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is collapsing and socialism is achieving one victory after another. Chairman Mao is the great teacher and leader of the world revolutionary people and the world proletariat."

Shreshta praised the profound significance of the Red Guards movement, saying, "The Red Guards movement has dashed the hopes of imperialists and reactionaries in various countries who wanted to make the younger generation deviate from the revolutionary path that China has taken."

He concluded, "We sincerely wish for the complete victory of China's proletarian cultural revolution and for the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought to fly high."

A Nepali writer stated that all revolutionary students and youth in the world should learn and apply Chairman Mao's great teachings, because Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world.

This Nepali writer said, as Chairman Mao taught, "The essence of Marxism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The revolutionary actions of tens of thousands of Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought have won the heartfelt support and admiration of all revolutionary people in the world.

This Nepali writer said, the Chinese Red Guards have become the unique exemplar for tens of millions of students and youth worldwide. They inspire all revolutionary fighters and the oppressed and exploited people to unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to make world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the only reliable and powerful weapon to eliminate exploitation and oppression and ultimately to eliminate imperialism and its lackeys.

    尼泊尔朋友说中国红卫兵是世界革命青年学习的典范
    让毛泽东思想红旗在全世界高高飘扬
    必须记取苏联赫鲁晓夫之流篡夺政权的历史教训
    据新华社加德满都电　尼泊尔朋友和作家最近向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命和战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。
    尼泊尔朋友什雷斯塔说：“震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是世界历史上最伟大的事件。”什雷斯塔强调指出：在苏联，由于没有解决社会主义和资本主义谁胜谁负的问题，以及如何巩固无产阶级专政和如何防止资本主义复辟等问题，赫鲁晓夫之流就篡夺了苏联的政权。记取南斯拉夫和苏联的惨痛的历史教训，人们就会感到中国的无产阶级文化大革命是巩固无产阶级专政和防止资本主义复辟的革命，这场革命为世界无产阶级历史增添了新的一章。
    他接着说：“这次革命证实了毛主席的论断：在社会主义社会仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争。”他说：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义崩溃和社会主义取得一个又一个胜利的时代的发展了的马克思列宁主义。毛主席是世界革命人民的导师和世界无产阶级的伟大领袖。”
    什雷斯塔赞扬了中国红卫兵运动的深远意义，他说：“红卫兵运动已经使帝国主义者和各国反动派企图使年青一代背离中国走过的革命道路的希望破灭了。”
    他最后说：“我们衷心祝愿：让中国的无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底的胜利，让毛泽东思想红旗高高飘扬。”
    一位尼泊尔作家发表谈话说，世界各国一切革命的学生和青年，要学习和运用毛主席的伟大教导，因为毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、全世界革命人民的领袖。
    这位尼泊尔作家说，正象毛主席教导的那样：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”成千上万用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国红卫兵小将的革命行动，得到了全世界一切革命人民的衷心支持和钦佩。
    这位尼泊尔作家说，中国红卫兵成为全世界千百万学生和青年学习的独一无二的典范。他们鼓舞着一切革命战士以及被剥削和被压迫的人民团结起来，在毛泽东思想的指引下，闹世界革命。毛泽东思想是消灭剥削和压迫并最后消灭帝国主义及其爪牙的唯一的最可靠和最强大的武器。
