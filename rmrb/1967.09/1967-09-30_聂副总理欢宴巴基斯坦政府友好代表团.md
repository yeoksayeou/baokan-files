He said, "Our enemies are extremely hostile and fearful of the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. They are trying every means to sow discord between us, create divisions, and achieve their nefarious goals.

Our socialist motherland has become more solid and stronger. Socialist China will unswervingly oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, and will forever be the most reliable friend of oppressed nations in their struggle for and defense of national independence, and the most loyal comrade-in-arms of the world's revolutionary people. Pakistani friends can be assured that in your struggle against imperialist interference and subversion, and in your struggle against Indian reactionary expansionism, the Chinese people will always be your friends. The friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan is unbreakable by anyone."

	Khawaja Shahabuddin, the delegation leader, thanked the Chinese government and people for their warm and enthusiastic reception of the delegation.

The Pakistani people attach great importance to this friendship. In recent years, the friendly relations between Pakistan and China have further developed. We believe that this friendship can be further strengthened."
