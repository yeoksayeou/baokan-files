The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives have greatly inspired the revolutionary masses of Qingdao, serving as a powerful driving force for their revolutionary unity. In recent days, the entire city of Qingdao has been adorned with red flags, filled with the sound of drums, and overflowing with joyous news, creating a fervent atmosphere of revolutionary unity. As of today, out of the five districts in the city, four have achieved comprehensive revolutionary unity among workers, peasants, merchants, students, government agencies, and neighborhoods.

Recently, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao issued a directive: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a lighthouse, guiding the revolutionary masses of the entire city forward. They have studied Chairman Mao's latest directive over and over again. The working class takes the lead, doing exactly as Chairman Mao says. As of today, all industrial and transportation enterprises in the city have basically achieved revolutionary unity. The working class leads the way, and all fronts follow closely behind. Revolutionary mass organizations in the fields of health, arts, commerce, and supply have also united one after another.

Many schools' Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest directive, have learned from the working class, and with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have launched a new wave of revolutionary unity. They have eliminated factionalism, swept away selfishness, and quickly united.

The wave of revolutionary unity across various fronts in Qingdao is surging forward. The momentum of the revolutionary great criticism is even more formidable. Broad revolutionary factions have formed a mighty army of the proletarian cultural revolution. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrate their firepower, and target their attacks on the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, launching even more fierce assaults, determined to achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

　　结成浩浩荡荡革命大军集中火力进行革命大批判
　　革命大联合浪潮席卷青岛
    据新华社济南二十二日电  伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，给青岛市无产阶级革命派以巨大鼓舞，成为推动他们实现革命大联合的巨大动力。连日来，青岛全城，到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，喜报频传，洋溢着革命大联合的热烈气氛。到今天为止，全市五个区，已有四个区的工、农、商、学、机关、街道全面地实现了革命的大联合。
    最近，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出了指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席这一最新指示象灯塔一样，给全市无产阶级革命派指明了前进的方向。他们一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示。工人阶级一马当先，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。到今天止，全市所有工交企业单位已经基本上实现了革命的大联合。工人阶级打先锋，各条战线紧紧跟。卫生、文艺、商业、供销等各条战线上的革命群众组织，也一个接着一个地联合起来。
    许多学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，向工人阶级学习，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，掀起了革命大联合的新高潮。他们铲除山头，横扫“私”字，迅速联合起来了。
    青岛市各条战线革命大联合的浪潮滚滚向前，革命的大批判气势更加壮阔。广大革命派组成了浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，集中火力，集中目标，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了更加猛烈的攻击，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
