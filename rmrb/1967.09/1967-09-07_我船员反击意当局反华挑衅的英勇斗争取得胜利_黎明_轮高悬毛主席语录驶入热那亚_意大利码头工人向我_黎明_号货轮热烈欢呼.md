The Chinese crew of the "Lingming" ship, after 23 days of brave struggle, thoroughly smashed the Italian authorities' anti-China political provocations. On the 5th, the Italian authorities had to withdraw their fascist measures against the "Lingming" and agreed to allow the ship, which prominently displays quotations from Chairman Mao, to enter the central area of Genoa to unload cargo. This is a major victory for our country's sailors in defending their sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought on their own ship and in defending the dignity of the motherland.

On the 4th, the representative of the Chinese Commercial Counselor's Office in Italy and the captain of the "Lingming" held a five-hour meeting with representatives of the Italian Foreign Trade Association in Genoa. They reached an agreement on the "Lingming" incident. Due to the Chinese side's resolute struggle over more than 20 days, the Italian authorities' anti-China actions became increasingly unpopular and their situation increasingly passive. The Italian side finally had to abandon its unreasonable demand that the "Lingming" remove the quotations from Chairman Mao, agreeing to withdraw the siege and blockade of the "Lingming," supply fresh water and food to the "Lingming," allow the crew of the "Lingming" to go ashore freely, and guarantee the normal operation of the "Lingming." The Chinese side agreed to remove the slogans protesting the Italian authorities' aforementioned atrocities after the Italian authorities supplied fresh water and the "Lingming" began unloading cargo.

In the early hours of the 5th, the "Lingming," which had been flying quotations from Chairman Mao and the slogans "Salute to the Italian Working People!" and "Long Live Chinese-Italian People's Friendship!" since its arrival on August 13, sailed into the central dock of Genoa. The Genoa Port Authority immediately supplied fresh water and food to the ship, connected the "Lingming" with the port's telephone, and issued visas for the crew of the "Lingming" to go ashore. The "Lingming" has begun unloading cargo. The dock workers of Genoa Harbor enthusiastically cheered for the "Lingming" and warmly welcomed the Chinese sailors who had fought bravely. The crew of some foreign ships moored in the harbor also enthusiastically waved and greeted the "Lingming."

Over the past 23 days, the crew of the "Lingming," who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the staff of the Chinese Commercial Counselor's Office in Italy have fought a resolute battle against the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities. The entire crew of the "Lingming" dropped all anchors on the deck, took an oath, and were ready to shed blood and sacrifice themselves, determined to fight to the end against the fascist atrocities of the Italian authorities, demonstrating the unyielding heroism of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The just struggle of the "Lingming" has received widespread support from the Italian people. Many progressive organizations in Italy have held mass rallies, sending representatives with letters of support to the Genoa Port to express their support for the Chinese sailors. The organization of dock workers in Genoa issued an ultimatum to the Italian authorities a few days ago, stating that if by the 5th the Italian authorities did not withdraw all hostile measures against the "Lingming," the dock workers of Genoa would go on a general strike. Representatives of many Italian enterprises that have trade relations with China also expressed their opposition to the Italian authorities' hostile actions against the Chinese people and the disruption of Sino-Italian trade to the Chinese Commercial Counselor's Office in Italy, and conducted negotiations with the relevant Italian authorities. Therefore, the victory of the "Lingming" is also a victory for all the Italian people who advocate Sino-Italian friendship and the development of trade between the two countries and support the just struggle of the "Lingming."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools." The final victory of the crew of the "Lingming" after 23 days of struggle in the port of Genoa once again proves that the quotation from Chairman Mao, which the Italian authorities fear so much and try in every way to force the "Lingming" to remove, is an unshakable truth.

　　我船员反击意当局反华挑衅的英勇斗争取得胜利
　　“黎明”轮高悬毛主席语录驶入热那亚
　　意大利码头工人向我“黎明”号货轮热烈欢呼
    据新华社六日讯　热那亚消息：中国远洋货轮“黎明”号全体船员经过二十三天英勇的斗争，彻底粉碎了意大利当局的反华政治挑衅。意大利当局五日不得不撤销它对“黎明”号采取的法西斯措施，同意高悬伟大领袖毛主席语录的“黎明”号驶入热那亚市中心区卸货。这是我国船员为维护在自己的船上学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，为维护祖国的尊严而取得的重大胜利。
    中国驻意大利商务代表处代表和“黎明”号船长四日在热那亚同意大利对外贸易协会的代表，经过五个小时的会谈，就“黎明”号事件达成了协议。由于中国方面二十多天来坚决斗争，意大利当局反华行径越来越不得人心，处境日益被动，意方最后不得不放弃强要“黎明”号摘除毛主席语录的无理要求，同意撤销对“黎明”号的包围和封锁，向“黎明”号供应淡水和粮食，让“黎明”号船员自由上岸，并且保证“黎明”号的一切正常作业。中国方面则同意在意大利当局供应淡水，“黎明”号开始卸货后取下抗议意大利当局上述暴行的标语。
    五日凌晨，“黎明”号悬挂着八月十三日进港以来一直高悬在甲板上的毛主席语录和“向意大利劳动人民致敬！”“中国意大利人民友谊万岁！”的标语驶入热那亚市中心的码头。热那亚港口当局随即向轮船供应了淡水和食品，接通了“黎明”号和港口的电话，发给了“黎明”号船员上岸的签证。“黎明”号已开始卸货。热那亚港的码头工人向“黎明”号热烈欢呼，热情欢迎进行了英勇斗争的中国船员。停泊在港内的一些外国轮船上的船员，也向“黎明”号热情地招手致意。
    二十三天来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的“黎明”号船员和中国驻意大利商务代表处的工作人员对意大利当局的法西斯暴行进行了针锋相对的斗争。“黎明”号全体船员抛下全部船锚，在甲板上宣誓，不惜流血牺牲，决心与意大利当局的法西斯暴行斗争到底，表现了以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民威武不屈的英雄气概。
      “黎明”号的正义斗争得到意大利人民广泛的支持。不少意大利进步组织纷纷举行群众集会，派出代表携带声援信到热那亚港对中国船员表示支持。热那亚码头工人的组织前几天还向意大利当局发出了最后通牒，表示如果到五日意大利当局还不撤销对“黎明”号的一切敌视措施，热那亚码头工人就要举行总罢工。许多同中国有贸易关系的意大利企业的代表也向中国驻意大利商务代表处表示反对意大利当局敌视中国人民，破坏中意贸易的行为，并向意大利有关当局进行了交涉。因此，“黎明”号的胜利也是所有主张中意人民友好和发展两国贸易，支持“黎明”号正义斗争的意大利人民的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”“黎明”号全体船员在热那亚港二十三天斗争的最后胜利，又一次证明了意大利当局怕得要死，千方百计妄想迫使“黎明”号摘除的这段毛主席语录，是颠扑不破的真理。
