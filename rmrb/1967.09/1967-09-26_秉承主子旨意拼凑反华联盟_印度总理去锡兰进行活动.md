	Carrying Out the Master's Will to Assemble an Anti-China Alliance
	Indian Prime Minister Visits Ceylon for Activities

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 23rd, our correspondent reports: The American imperialist's lackey, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, conducted four days of conspiratorial activities in Ceylon from the 18th to the 21st, attempting to lure Ceylon into joining an anti-China alliance.

	Indira Gandhi's visit to Ceylon came after the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries launched an anti-China campaign internationally and after the Indian reactionaries launched a military attack on China's Sikkim border.

	During her talks with Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Indira Gandhi vigorously attempted to lure Ceylon into joining the Indian reactionaries' efforts, under the direction of American imperialism, to form an anti-China alliance disguised as a "regional economic cooperation."

	The Indian reactionaries have long attempted to form a broader anti-China alliance than the anti-China organization "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" that the Indonesian reactionaries formed at the behest of the United States. Indira Gandhi, before her departure for Ceylon, had been vigorously anti-China, shouting about how "the Chinese threat is very real" and "the threat is always present." During her stay in Ceylon, she again launched vicious attacks against China from multiple angles.

	She did not mention the Indian reactionaries' occupation of large tracts of Chinese territory along the Sino-Indian border and their recent military provocations along the Sino-Sikkim border. Instead, she insinuated that China frequently instigates "conflicts" along the Sino-Indian border. She also viciously slandered China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Indian reactionaries follow a pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China policy, leading to internal and external difficulties and a dead end. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Deputy Prime Minister Desai, and Defense Minister Singh have separately visited the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Ceylon, all with the aim of seeking a way out and anti-China alliances.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools." The Indian reactionaries are exactly such fools, and their anti-China conspiracies will inevitably meet with a shameful failure.

### 秉承主子旨意拼凑反华联盟　印度总理去锡兰进行活动

　　秉承主子旨意拼凑反华联盟
　　印度总理去锡兰进行活动
    据新华社二十三日讯　本社记者报道：美帝走卒印度总理英迪拉·甘地，从十八日到二十一日在锡兰进行四天阴谋活动，拉拢锡兰参加反华联盟。
    英迪拉·甘地是在帝、修、反在国际上掀起反华逆流和印度反动派在中国—锡金边境向中国发动武装进攻之后跑到锡兰去进行活动的。
    英迪拉·甘地在同锡兰总理森纳那亚克会谈时，极力拉拢锡兰参加印度反动派按照美帝旨意，要拼凑一个披着“区域性经济合作”外衣的反华联盟。
    印度反动派早就企图拼凑一个比印尼反动派奉美国主子之命出面拼凑的反华组织“东南亚国家联盟”更广泛的反华联盟，为美帝苏修阴谋策划的反华包围圈效劳。英迪拉·甘地在动身去锡兰前就拚命反华，叫嚷什么“中国的威胁是非常真实的”，“威胁始终存在着”。她在锡兰期间又对中国进行了多方面的恶毒攻击。
    她闭口不谈印度反动派在中印边境占领中国的大片土地、最近又在中国—锡金边境进行军事挑衅，却含沙射影地诬蔑中国在中印边境不时挑起“冲突”。她还恶毒地对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行诬蔑。
    印度反动派奉行亲美、联苏、反华政策，弄得内外交困，走投无路。最近印度总理英迪拉·甘地、副总理德赛和国防部长辛格分别到美国、苏联、日本和锡兰等国活动，其目的都是在寻求出路和反华。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。”印度反动派也就是这样一批蠢人，它的反华阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
