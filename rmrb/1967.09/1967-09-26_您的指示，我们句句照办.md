Just as the revolutionary masses were joyfully welcoming the 18th anniversary of our great national day, a great piece of news was announced: our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, despite his old age and hardships, traveled thousands of miles to personally inspect Hunan. The mountains are cheering, the rivers are leaping, and millions of revolutionary masses are singing in unison to praise the red sun in our hearts. In countless words, all voices converge into one: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!

Great Chairman Mao! It is you, our leader, who, at every critical moment of the revolution, issue battle commands of great strategic significance; following you, the revolution is invincible.

Great Chairman Mao! It is you, our leader, who, at the critical moment of the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads in Hunan, guided us, the proletarian revolutionaries, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to relentlessly pursue and attack China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders in Hunan who are taking the capitalist road. From then on, we proletarian revolutionaries have moved from victory to victory.

Great Chairman Mao! It is you, our leader, who, at the critical moment of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in Hunan, personally inspected Changsha and gave us the latest instructions. This is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us revolutionaries.

We will carry out your latest instructions to the letter, sentence by sentence. We will study your instructions as our guiding principles, internalize them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We will firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, wield the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "hitting a fallen dog." We will organize millions of people, mobilize the vast revolutionary army, and use both words and writing to thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that they can never rise again. We will act with the spirit of "seizing the day," achieve the great unity of the revolutionaries, and quickly realize the "three-in-one combination." We will make anarchism, factionalism, and petty-bourgeois factionalism "stand aside." We, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, will definitely turn Hunan into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　您的指示，我们句句照办
　　湖南省长沙“工联”
    正当广大革命群众满怀喜悦心情，迎接我们伟大国庆十八周年的时候，公布了特大的喜讯：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，他老人家不辞辛苦，不远千里，亲临湖南视察。群山在欢呼，江水在跳跃，千万革命群众在齐声歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳。千言万语，万言千语，汇成了一个声音：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    伟大的毛主席啊！是您老人家每当革命斗争的关键时刻，就发出具有伟大战略意义的战斗号令；跟着您前进，革命就无往而不胜。
    伟大的毛主席啊！是您老人家在我们湖南地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，教导我们无产阶级革命派牢牢掌握斗争大方向，穷追猛打中国赫鲁晓夫和湖南地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从此，我们无产阶级革命派从胜利走向胜利。
    伟大的毛主席啊！是您老人家在我们湖南地区无产阶级革命派大联合的关键时刻，亲临长沙视察，给我们作了最新指示。这是对我们革命派最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。
    我们对您老人家的最新指示，坚决执行，句句照办。我们一定把您的指示当作座右铭来学，溶化在血液里，落实在行动上。我们要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命大军，口诛笔伐，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。我们要用“只争朝夕”的精神，实现革命派的大联合，尽快地实现革命的“三结合”，让无政府主义、山头主义、小资产阶级的派性“靠边站”。我们广大无产阶级革命派一定要把湖南办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
