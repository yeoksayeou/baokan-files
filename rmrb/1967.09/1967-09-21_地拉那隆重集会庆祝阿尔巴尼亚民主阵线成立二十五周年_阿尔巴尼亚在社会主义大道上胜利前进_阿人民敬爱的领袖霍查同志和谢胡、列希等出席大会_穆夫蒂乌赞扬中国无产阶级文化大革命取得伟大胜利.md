The people of Tirana, the capital of Albania, held a grand rally on September 17 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Democratic Front.

Pezë is a village on the outskirts of Tirana. On September 16, 1942, the Albanian Communist Party (the predecessor of the Albanian Labor Party) convened the National Liberation Conference there. The conference decided to establish the Albanian People's Anti-Fascist National Liberation Front and laid the foundation for the establishment of a new people's government, which greatly promoted the further development of the Albanian national liberation struggle.

At 10:30 a.m., the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the founder of the Albanian Democratic Front, and other party and government leaders, including Shehu and List, arrived at the venue. They laid a wreath at the martyrs' tomb and then ascended the platform. At this moment, the entire venue immediately became excited, and shouts of "Enver Hoxha!", "The Party!", "The Party, Enver, we are always ready!" echoed through the sky.

The celebration was attended by all representatives of the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front, old guerrillas who had fought in the Pezë area, workers, peasants, and soldiers.

After the celebration began, Muftiu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party and the first secretary of the Tirana Municipal Committee, spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, the Council of Ministers, and the National Committee of the Democratic Front.

Muftiu said that the Pezë Conference marked the first great victory of the correct line of our Party in the struggle to liberate the country, and the first heavy defeat of all reactionary forces. He said that the Party laid the foundation for uniting the people in the National Liberation Front and completed a major task at that time to achieve the fundamental strategic goal of completely liberating the country and establishing a people's government. Over the past 25 years, our people have always been closely united in the ranks of the Democratic Front and have built a new Albania on the ruins of the past, a socialist Albania that is becoming increasingly beautiful and advancing with rapid and steady steps. In this new struggle, our people have won victories and will continue to win victories because our people are following the path indicated by our glorious Labor Party.

Muftiu pointed out that we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Pezë Conference just after the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front has concluded. The Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front has further inspired the fighting spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm of all the working people, workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth in our country.

Muftiu pointed out that the experience of Albania so far has proven that only a Marxist-Leninist party that is loyal to the people and the cause of communism can lead the country to victory in the struggle for revolution and the construction of socialism and communism. After the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Marxist-Leninist party should summarize new experiences and continuously take revolutionary measures to prevent retrogression and avoid the danger of socialist countries degenerating into revisionism and capitalism.

He pointed out that the Albanian Labor Party is at the forefront of the struggle against all enemies of the people, revolution, and socialism. The prestige of the Labor Party is growing, and it has won the love of all revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists who are striving to achieve common ideals.

In discussing international issues, Muftiu pointed out that the imperialists led by the United States are the most vicious enemies of the people of all countries. The traitors and renegades of Marxism-Leninism and the international communist movement, the Khrushchev revisionists, are becoming increasingly close with the imperialist leaders and are strengthening the alliance and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, attempting to strike at the people of all countries with their poisonous knives. They are afraid of the victorious advance of the great people's China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, afraid of the great people's China's victories and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that are turning the hopes of all domestic and foreign revisionists in China into ashes. They are terrified and anxious about the developments in Vietnam, attempting to impose so-called "peace talks" on Vietnam. The betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists is not limited to Vietnam. They have betrayed the Arab people, betraying the just struggle of the Arab people against American imperialism and its lackey Israel. However, the wheel of history will not turn back. As Comrade Enver Hoxha said in his report to the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front, the revolution is brewing, developing, and strengthening like a storm.

Muftiu finally said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, Albania is steadily advancing on the socialist road. Our present is beautiful, and our future will be even more beautiful. Our enemies—the American imperialists, the Khrushchev revisionists, the Greek royalist fascists—are afraid of our achievements and are plotting tricks and conspiracies while dreaming with their eyes open. Any aggressor should think carefully before attacking Albania. Albania has a people fully mobilized to defend their country. Albania has sincere and powerful friends. Whoever opposes us will perish. Socialist Albania, heroic Albania, will last forever.

Muftiu's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic cheers.

After the celebration, Comrade Enver Hoxha and other party and government leaders visited the Pezë Conference Memorial Hall. Representatives from various regions of the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front performed wonderful artistic performances, fully demonstrating the boundless love of the Albanian people for the Labor Party and their beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

The heroic people of Albania are advancing on the road of revolutionization, with the Albanian working class at the forefront of the revolutionization movement. The picture shows the director of the Tirana Weaving Factory (right) and workers studying the quality of the products.

    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那人民，十七日在佩扎举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线成立二十五周年。
    佩扎是地拉那郊区的一个村庄。一九四二年九月十六日，阿尔巴尼亚共产党（阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的前身）在那里筹备并召开了民族解放代表会议。会议决定建立阿尔巴尼亚人民反法西斯民族解放阵线，并为建立新的人民政权奠定了基础，有力地推动了阿尔巴尼亚民族解放斗争的进一步发展。
    上午十点半钟，阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线创始人霍查同志和其他党政领导人谢胡、列希等来到会场，向烈士墓敬献花圈，并登上主席台。这时，全场立刻沸腾起来，“恩维尔·霍查！”“劳动党！”“劳动党，恩维尔，我们时刻准备着！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    出席庆祝大会的还有参加阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会的全体代表，当年在佩扎地区坚持武装斗争的老游击队员、工人、农民和战士等。
    庆祝大会开始后，劳动党中央政治局委员、地拉那市委第一书记穆夫蒂乌，代表党中央、部长会议和民主阵线全国委员会在会上讲话。
    穆夫蒂乌说，佩扎会议标志着在解放祖国的斗争中我党正确路线的第一个伟大胜利，标志着一切反动势力的第一次惨重的失败。他说，党奠定了把人民团结在民族解放阵线中的基础，完成了当时为达到彻底解放祖国和建立人民政权这一基本战略目标的一项主要任务。二十五年来，我国人民始终紧密地团结在民主阵线的队伍中，并在过去的废墟上建立起一个新的阿尔巴尼亚，一个变得日益美好、以迅速和稳健的步伐前进的社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚。在这场新的斗争中，我国人民取得了胜利，并将不断取得胜利，因为我国人民遵循着我们光荣的劳动党所指出的道路。
    穆夫蒂乌指出，我们是在民主阵线四大刚刚闭幕的时候来庆祝佩扎会议二十五周年的。民主阵线四大更加激发了我国全体劳动群众，工人、农民、知识分子、妇女和青年的战斗精神和革命干劲。
    穆夫蒂乌指出，阿尔巴尼亚迄今的经验证明，只有一个对人民和共产主义事业赤胆忠心的马克思列宁主义的党，才能在革命和建设社会主义和共产主义的斗争中把国家引向胜利。在建立无产阶级专政以后，马克思列宁主义党应当总结新的经验，不断采取具有革命性质的措施，以防止倒退，避免社会主义国家蜕化变质为修正主义和资本主义的危险。
    他指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在反对各国人民的、革命的和社会主义的一切敌人的斗争中站在第一线。劳动党的威信日益增长，得到了起来争取实现共同理想的所有革命者和马克思列宁主义者的热爱。
    穆夫蒂乌在谈到国际问题时指出，以美国为首的帝国主义者是各国人民最凶恶的敌人。马克思列宁主义和国际共产主义运动的变节分子和叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，同帝国主义头子打得越来越火热，并且正在加强苏美同盟与合作，企图把它们的毒刀砍向各国人民。它们害怕毛泽东主席领导下的伟大人民中国的胜利前进，害怕伟大人民中国的胜利和正在把中国国内外修正主义者的全部希望化为灰烬的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。它们对越南事态的发展恐慌不安，妄图把所谓的“和谈”强加给越南。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛不仅局限于越南。他们出卖了阿拉伯人民，背叛了阿拉伯人民反对美帝及其走狗以色列的正义斗争。但是，历史的车轮不会倒退。正如霍查同志在民主阵线四大的报告中所说的，革命象暴风雨一样，正在酝酿，发展和加强。
    穆夫蒂乌最后说，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚正在社会主义道路上稳步前进。我们的现在是美好的，我们的未来将更加美好。我们的敌人——美帝国主义者、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、希腊保皇法西斯分子害怕我们的成就，并且策划阴谋诡计，在睁着眼睛作梦。任何侵略者在反对阿尔巴尼亚以前都应该好好想一想。阿尔巴尼亚有着全部动员起来保卫祖国的人民。阿尔巴尼亚有着真诚和强大的朋友。谁反对我们，谁就将自取灭亡。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚将与世长存。
    穆夫蒂乌的讲话不断为热烈的欢呼声所打断。
    庆祝大会结束后，霍查同志和党政其他领导同志参观了佩扎代表会议纪念馆。来自一些地区的民主阵线四大的代表们表演了精彩的文艺节目，充分体现了阿尔巴尼亚人民对劳动党、对自己敬爱的领袖霍查同志的无限热爱。（附图片）
