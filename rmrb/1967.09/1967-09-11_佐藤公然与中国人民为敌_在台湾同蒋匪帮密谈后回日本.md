Sato, the faithful lackey of American imperialism and Prime Minister of the Japanese government, returned to Japan on the afternoon of the 9th after conducting three days of conspiratorial activities in Taiwan.

According to reports, Sato held two secret meetings with Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, in Taiwan. In his written statement upon his return to Japan, he shouted: "They exchanged views frankly in a friendly and amicable atmosphere" on issues related to Japan-Chiang relations and anti-communist, anti-China policies. The so-called "joint communiqué" issued by Japan and Chiang revealed that the reactionary Sato government of Japan will continue to intensify its political, economic, and cultural infiltration of our country's territory, Taiwan.

This time, Sato's intrusion into our country's territory, Taiwan, openly opposed the Chinese people and served the American imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas." He engaged in extensive collusion with the Chiang clique's leaders, including Yen Chia-kan, Chiang Ching-kuo, and the old-time traitor Ho Ying-chin.

    佐藤公然与中国人民为敌
    在台湾同蒋匪帮密谈后回日本
    新华社十日讯　美帝国主义的忠实走狗日本政府首相佐藤荣作，在台湾进行三天阴谋活动后，于九日下午滚回日本。
    据报道，佐藤在台湾和美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石进行了两次秘密会谈。他在滚回日本时发表的书面谈话中叫喊：他们“在亲切友好之气氛中”就日蒋关系、反共反华等问题“坦诚”地交换了“意见”。在发表的日蒋所谓“联合公报”里透露，日本佐藤反动政府，将继续加紧对我国领土台湾进行政治、经济、文化侵略。
    佐藤这次窜入我国领土台湾，明目张胆地与中国人民为敌，为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。他同蒋匪帮头目严家淦、蒋经国、老牌汉奸何应钦等进行了广泛的勾结。
