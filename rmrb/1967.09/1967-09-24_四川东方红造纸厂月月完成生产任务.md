The revolutionary cadres and workers of the Dongfanghong Paper Mill in Sichuan have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Since the beginning of this year, while engaged in fierce struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, they have completed or overfulfilled the production plan every month. From January to August, the total output of machine-made paper in the entire mill increased by 16 percent compared to the same period last year, effectively guaranteeing the need for paper in the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Chengdu region.

    四川东方红造纸厂月月完成生产任务
    四川东方红造纸厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，今年以来，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行激烈斗争的同时，月月都完成或超额完成生产计划。一到八月份全厂机制纸总产量比去年同期增长了百分之十六，有力地保证了成都地区无产阶级文化大革命深入开展对纸张的需要。　（据新华社讯）
