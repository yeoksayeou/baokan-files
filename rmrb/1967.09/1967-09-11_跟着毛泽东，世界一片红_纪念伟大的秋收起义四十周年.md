In September 1927, when the Chinese revolution was at a critical juncture, our great leader Chairman Mao raised the banner of armed struggle, based on the peasant movement in Hunan, personally organized and led the peasant uprising, launched the epoch-making Autumn Harvest Uprising and marched towards Jinggangshan. The first armed force led by the Party was established, and the first red revolutionary base area was created. From then on, the revolutionary path of the proletarian vanguard directly seizing arms, entering the countryside, leading the peasants in armed struggle, establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and seizing national power was opened.

This great initiative by Chairman Mao greatly enriched and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. It not only opened the correct path to victory for the Chinese people but also created a new path for the proletariat and oppressed nations worldwide to achieve thorough liberation.

Chairman Mao said: "Because the powerful imperialists and their reactionary allies in China have long occupied China's central cities, if the revolutionary forces do not want to compromise with imperialism and its running dogs and insist on struggling, if the revolutionary forces want to accumulate and temper their strength and avoid decisive battles with strong enemies when their strength is insufficient, they must turn backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated base areas, into great revolutionary strongholds in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, to counter the ferocious enemies who use cities to attack rural areas, and to gradually achieve complete revolutionary victory in a long-term struggle."

This tells us: To make a revolution, we must plant our roots in the countryside and rely on the countryside to grow and accumulate strength. Break through in the countryside and then push the revolution towards the cities to seize national power.

This tells us that the revolutionary war must advance in waves, gradually eliminating the enemy and seizing their positions. Absolutely avoid decisive battles with strong enemies when our strength is insufficient.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed but are produced and developed through struggle."

During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, our Party had three consecutive "Left" opportunist lines represented by Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, and Wang Ming. Without exception, they all opposed Chairman Mao's path of surrounding the cities with the countryside. They either ordered Communist Party members to lead a small number of workers to launch urban uprisings with no chance of victory or commanded the weak Red Army to attack large cities. The result was only to be defeated by the strong enemy. Especially the third "Left" opportunist line represented by Wang Ming, which caused extremely serious consequences for the Chinese revolution.

China's Khrushchev, like Chen Duxiu and Wang Ming, is a thoroughgoing old revisionist. He is both a "parliamentary fanatic" and a "city uprising" propagandist. For decades, he has consistently opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary path of first entering the countryside, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and finally seizing national power. After national victory, he still used every opportunity to spread his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. In 1962, he even absurdly said, "Whether the victory of the revolution is from the city to the countryside or from the countryside to the city, the result is the same, it is not a matter of principle."

Is it really like that? No, it is not at all.

During the Second Revolutionary Civil War in our country, Wang Ming, in order to promote his "from city to countryside" opportunist line, caused the Party in the white areas to suffer nearly 100% losses and the base areas and the Red Army to suffer 90% losses. Isn't this "not a matter of principle"?

The poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's nonsense has caused some brother parties' struggles to suffer serious setbacks. Isn't this also "not a matter of principle"?

The essence of China's Khrushchev's fallacy is to cover up his own crimes, to rehabilitate the "Left" opportunist line of Wang Ming and others, and also to adapt to the needs of American imperialism, to collude with the modern revisionist group, and attempt to lead the world revolution astray.

"Follow Mao Zedong and walk the path of the Chinese revolution." This is a conclusion drawn by the revolutionary people of the world from their own revolutionary experiences, and it is also their heartfelt call.

"The seas churn with clouds and waves, and the continents tremble with thunder."

The heroic people of South Vietnam, relying on rural base areas, have widely launched guerrilla warfare, driving more than a million modern-equipped American puppet troops into a state of confusion and difficulty.

The Burmese Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has persisted in armed struggle for more than twenty years. The flames of rural guerrilla warfare have spread over more than 70% of Burma's land.

The people of Laos have also achieved brilliant victories in their war against American imperialism and its running dogs.

The revolutionary people of Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries are vigorously developing armed struggles in the countryside.

Under the bloody rule of Nasution-Suharto, the revolutionary people of Indonesia, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, have also broken through and are deeply entering the countryside to launch a magnificent armed struggle.

The hungry peasants in Darjeeling, India, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party, have also taken up arms to rebel.

Armed struggles are surging in many countries and regions in Africa and Latin America.

Looking at the world, the situation is excellent. The lifespans of imperialism and all reactionaries will not be long. "All the people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and advance bravely. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

Following Mao Zedong, the world turns red.

    跟着毛泽东，世界一片红
    ——纪念伟大的秋收起义四十周年	高等军事学院“红联”兵团
    一九二七年九月，正当中国革命处在危急关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席高举武装斗争的革命大旗，在湖南农民运动的基础上，亲自组织和发动了农民暴动，举行了具有划时代意义的秋收起义和向井冈山进军，创建了第一支由党领导的人民军队，建立起第一块红色革命根据地。从此，开创了无产阶级先锋队直接掌握武装，深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国政权的革命道路。
    毛主席这一伟大创举，极大地丰富和创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国胜利的正确道路，也为全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族争取彻底解放，开创了一条新的航道。
    毛主席说：“因为强大的帝国主义及其在中国的反动同盟军，总是长期地占据着中国的中心城市，如果革命的队伍不愿意和帝国主义及其走狗妥协，而要坚持地奋斗下去，如果革命的队伍要准备积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，并避免在力量不够的时候和强大的敌人作决定胜负的战斗，那就必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”
    这就告诉我们：搞革命必须把根子扎在农村，依靠农村生长和积蓄力量。在农村杀出一条路来，然后将革命推向城市，夺取全国政权。
    这就告诉我们，革命战争必须波浪式地推进，一部分一部分地消灭敌人，一块一块地夺取敌人的阵地。绝对避免在力量不够时，同强大的敌人决战。
    毛主席教导我们说：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”
    在第二次国内革命战争中，我们党内曾连续出现了以瞿秋白、李立三、王明为代表的三次“左”倾机会主义路线，他们毫无例外地都是反对毛主席农村包围城市的道路。他们不是指使共产党员带领少数工人群众举行毫无胜利把握的城市暴动，就是命令弱小的红军去攻打大城市。结果，只能在强大的敌人面前碰得头破血流。特别是以王明为代表的第三次“左”倾机会主义路线，给中国革命造成了极其严重的恶果。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和陈独秀、王明一样，是一个地地道道的老修正主义者。他既是一个“议会迷”，又是一个“城市暴动”的吹鼓手。几十年来，他一贯反对毛主席的首先深入农村，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权的革命道路。全国胜利以后，他仍然利用一切机会散布他那套反革命修正主义的谬论。一九六二年，他还胡说什么“革命的胜利，是城市到乡村，还是乡村到城市，其结果都是一样，不是原则问题。”
    果真是这样的吗？不，完全不是。
    我国第二次国内革命战争时期，王明为了推行其“由城市到乡村”的机会主义路线，使白区党几乎损失百分之百，使根据地和红军损失百分之九十，难道这“不是原则问题”吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫一派胡言乱语的流毒，使有的兄弟党的斗争受到了严重的挫折，难道这也“不是原则问题”吗？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫这一谬论，实质上是为他自己的罪行开脱，为王明等人的“左”倾机会主义路线翻案，也是为了适应美帝国主义的需要，配合现代修正主义集团，妄图把世界革命引向邪路上去。
    “跟着毛泽东，走中国革命的路。”这是世界革命人民从自身的革命经历中得出的一条结论，也是他们发自肺腑的呼声。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”
    英雄的越南南方人民，依靠农村根据地，广泛地开展游击战争，把一百多万现代化装备的美伪军，打得焦头烂额，进退两难。
    高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的缅甸共产党，坚持了长达二十年的武装斗争，农村游击战争的烽火，燃遍了缅甸百分之七十以上的土地。
    老挝人民，在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的战争中，也已经取得了辉煌的胜利。
    泰国、菲律宾等国革命人民，在农村开展的武装斗争，也正在如火如荼地发展着。
    在纳苏蒂安—苏哈托血腥统治下的印度尼西亚的革命人民，在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，也杀出来了，正在深入农村，展开轰轰烈烈的武装斗争。
    印度大吉岭地区饥饿的农民，在印度共产党革命派的领导下，也拿起枪杆子造反了。
    非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家和地区的武装斗争，正风起云涌。
    展望世界，形势一片大好。帝国主义和一切反动派的寿命不会太长了。“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    跟着毛泽东，世界一片红。
