The China Foreign Affairs Committee held a banquet today to welcome the Vietnamese Acrobatics Troupe led by Wu Yuming. The delegation from the University and Secondary Specialized Department of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Chen Song, who is currently visiting Beijing, was also invited to attend the banquet.

Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, and others attended the banquet. The atmosphere at the banquet was filled with the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

Deputy Director of the China Foreign Affairs Committee Zhou Yiping gave a speech at the banquet, enthusiastically praising the heroic Vietnamese people for displaying the immense power of people's war under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, achieving brilliant victories in the anti-American national salvation war. He strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for intensifying their collusion with American imperialism, aiding the American aggressors in their "bombing to force negotiations" and "bombing to lure negotiations" schemes, attempting to sell out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people.

He said that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until they achieve final victory in the anti-American national salvation war.

Wu Yuming, the troupe leader, then spoke. He said that at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is deepening and when the Chinese people are celebrating the 18th anniversary of their national day, we have come from the anti-American frontline, bringing the deep fighting friendship of the Vietnamese people for the Chinese people, and with hearts full of admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, we are very happy to visit and perform in China.

Chen Song, the leader of the Vietnamese University and Secondary Specialized Department delegation, said in his speech, "The Communist Party of China holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and has become a staunch defender of the purity of Marxism-Leninism. We firmly believe that no matter what happens, the peoples of China and Vietnam will always be brothers, always be comrades, and always be close friends."

Also invited to the banquet were Li Zhongshi, the acting charge d'affaires of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, the acting head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in China, and other Vietnamese comrades.
