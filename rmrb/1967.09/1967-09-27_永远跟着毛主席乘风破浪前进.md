	Great Chairman Mao! In the days of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, amidst the blood and rain, you traversed the banks of the Xiang River, "arousing the thousands and millions of workers and peasants, united in heart, to act," raising the banner of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, establishing the first armed force of workers and peasants.

	Great Chairman Mao! In the years of war, you led the revolutionary army across the Five Ridges and Jinsha, through snow-capped mountains and grasslands, with long ropes in hand, subduing the dragons, defeating one enemy after another, establishing the great New China.

	Great Chairman Mao! In the years of socialist revolution and construction, you traversed the Three Mountains and Five Rivers, the Nine Rivers and Eight Lakes, leading us to change the face of our impoverished and backward country; you also called on us, "Never forget class struggle," to carry the revolution through to the end.

	Great Chairman Mao! Today, at this crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have again traversed the south of the Yangtze River and the banks of the Yellow River, issuing one great call after another, guiding the ship of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You, at your advanced age, still tirelessly inspect and investigate on the ground, day and night, caring for the great affairs of the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world, how can we not be deeply moved! You are the model for the people of the world to learn from, the example for all revolutionary people to follow!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You, at your advanced age, traverse tens of thousands of miles, full of energy, and in good health, how can we not be overjoyed! Your health is the greatest happiness for the people of China and the people of the whole world!

	Great Chairman Mao, based on your latest instructions, a new wave of revolutionary great unity has swept across the country. We, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 31 Middle School, have also achieved revolutionary great unity on this inspiring day. In the past, we only looked at problems from the perspective of small groups, so both sides were in long-term opposition. Recently, we have repeatedly studied your teachings: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has six hundred million people, and we must never forget this point." The proletariat can only liberate all of humanity to finally liberate itself. Everyone's horizons have broadened, and what we see is no longer our own small group, but all of China and the world. Some comrades said, the contradictions between our two organizations are not as great as the contradictions between us and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. The differences between our two organizations are not as deep as the differences between us and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. We must treat the current revolutionary great unity from the height of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, unite, and fight the enemy together. Your teachings are like a master key, opening the hearts of each of us, making us understand everything, with clear minds and bright eyes. Everyone held meetings overnight, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

	We deeply understand that achieving revolutionary great unity is just the first step of the long march, and serious tasks still lie before us. We are determined to immediately establish a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership cadre. We resolutely liberate and boldly use revolutionary cadres, helping them to better contribute all their efforts to the party in appropriate positions. We must continue to strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and in the process of consulting to establish a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership cadre, abandon factional consciousness, break organizational boundaries, not vie for positions, and resolutely do "appoint the virtuous," not "appoint the factional." We must respond to your great call for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in middle schools to get back on track, and do our utmost to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our school quickly get back on track.

　　永远跟着毛主席乘风破浪前进
　　北京三十一中　井冈山兵团　教工大联合
    伟大的毛主席啊！在国民党反动统治的血雨腥风的日子里，您走遍了湘江两岸，“唤起工农千百万，同心干”，举起了秋收起义的革命大旗，建立了第一支工农革命武装。
    伟大的毛主席啊！在烽火连天的岁月中，您率领着革命大军走遍了五岭金沙、雪山草地，长缨在手，缚住苍龙，战胜了一个又一个敌人，建立了伟大的新中国。
    伟大的毛主席啊！在社会主义革命和建设的年代里，您走遍了三山五岳，九江八河，率领我们改变祖国一穷二白的面貌；您同时号召我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，要将革命进行到底。
    伟大的毛主席啊！今天，在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头，您又走遍了大江南北、黄河两岸，向我们发出一个又一个的伟大号召，引导无产阶级文化大革命的航船，胜利前进。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家这么大年纪还不辞辛劳，四出视察，实地调查，为全国人民、全世界革命人民的大事日夜操心，叫我们如何不激动万分！您是世界人民学习的楷模，是一切革命人民学习的榜样！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家这么大年纪跋涉万里，精力充沛，健康过人，叫我们怎么不高兴万分！您的健康就是中国人民和全世界人民的最大幸福！
    伟大的毛主席，就是根据您的最新指示，全国掀起了革命大联合的新高潮。我们北京三十一中全体革命师生，也在这个振奋人心的日子里实现了革命的大联合。过去，我们只从小团体的角度看问题，因此双方长期对立。最近，我们反复学习了您的教导：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。大家开阔了眼界，看到的不再是自己的小团体，而是全中国、全世界。有的同志说，我们两个组织之间的矛盾再大，也大不过我们和帝、修、反的矛盾，我们两个组织之间的分歧再深，也深不过我们和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派之间的矛盾。我们一定要从中国革命和世界革命的高度来对待当前的革命大联合，团结起来，共同对敌。您的教导象一把万能的钥匙，打开了我们每一个人的心窍，使我们一通百通，心明眼亮。大家连夜开会，迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    我们深深懂得，实现革命的大联合只是万里长征第一步，严重的任务还摆在我们的面前。我们决心立即建立革命的“三结合”领导班子。我们坚决解放和大胆使用革命的领导干部，帮助他们在适当的岗位上更好地为党贡献自己的一切力量。我们一定要继续加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，在协商成立革命“三结合”的领导班子时，摒弃派别观念，打破组织界限，不争名额，坚决做到“任人唯贤”，决不“任人唯派”。我们一定要响应您的中学无产阶级文化大革命要走上正轨的伟大号召，尽最大努力，使我校的无产阶级文化大革命迅速走上正轨。
