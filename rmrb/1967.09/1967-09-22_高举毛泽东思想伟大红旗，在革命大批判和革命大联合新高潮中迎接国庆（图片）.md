	Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the new high tide of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great alliance, welcome the National Day!

	Comrades!

	The great proletarian cultural revolution is now entering a new stage of development. In the past few months, the revolutionary masses in various places have, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao as the core, launched a powerful revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great alliance, and achieved great victories. The revolutionary situation in the country is developing rapidly and in a healthy direction. The revolutionary masses are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and are actively participating in the great revolutionary criticism and revolutionary great alliance, and are striving to achieve greater victories.

	The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The great proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and is a thoroughgoing revolution. It is to overthrow those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic 'authorities' and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art, and all other parts of the superstructure that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system."
