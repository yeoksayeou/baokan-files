The revolutionary situation in Beijing and Shanghai is better than ever.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution is advancing victoriously. Revolutionary factions have formed an unprecedentedly powerful and extensive cultural revolution army, concentrating their firepower to fiercely attack the Chinese Khrushchev. Columns of big-character posters for revolutionary criticism are lined up along the streets. Revolutionary youngsters who have gone out to connect with others are resolutely responding to the call of the central party leaders, continuously returning from other places to their own units.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 5th, under the extremely important battle call issued at the enlarged meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee attended by the central party leaders, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the capital have taken swift action. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They will advance along the revolutionary course of Chairman Mao's line, striving for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At present, Beijing faces an unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation. The counter-revolutionary line is heading towards complete collapse, and revolutionary forces are thriving and becoming increasingly consolidated. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the entire city are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting in their hatred of the enemy, and launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. After the issuance of the new battle call by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately issued the resolution "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Strive for New Victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The new battle call of the central party and the resolution of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee have become new powerful driving forces for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital to advance victoriously along the course indicated by Chairman Mao. An unprecedentedly large-scale revolutionary criticism mass movement is surging forward in a magnificent manner. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the capital are organizing an unprecedentedly powerful and extensive cultural revolution army. They are launching a political, ideological, and theoretical offensive against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, concentrating their firepower and targets to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Countless columns of big-character posters for revolutionary criticism are lined up along the streets, standing side by side on major streets. In recent days, these columns of revolutionary criticism big-character posters have spread from urban areas to rural areas in the suburbs, turning the entire capital into a vast battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, and other colleges and universities have seen revolutionary youngsters who went out to connect with others returning to Beijing in recent days. Students still in school at Tsinghua University and other institutions have sent telegrams and letters to their comrades-in-arms who are connecting with others in other places, hoping they will return to Beijing as soon as possible to work together to carry out revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-reform in their own units. The Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics has issued another notice, requiring all teachers and students who are connecting with others in other places to return to school within seven days. Some revolutionary youngsters who have recently returned have, based on their personal experiences and observations in various places, studied the new orders of the central party, and have a clearer understanding of the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said that after more than a year of Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the masses in various places have been mobilized, and the movement is advancing victoriously. We should believe in the proletarian revolutionary factions in various places. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they can educate themselves and liberate themselves. In today's good situation, it is wrong for us to engage in large-scale connections again. On the afternoon of the 4th, Beijing Normal University held a mobilization meeting, expressing their determination to seriously study and resolutely implement the battle call of the central party leaders, and to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. In the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, the campus is filled with big-character posters, slogans, and cartoons, exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Various departments have held large, medium, and small-scale criticism and struggle meetings, forming a new high tide of the revolutionary criticism movement.

The revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards of Beijing No. 23 Middle School, Dongtiezhuang No. 1 Middle School, and Shijingshan Middle School, which have made significant achievements in revolutionary criticism, great alliance, and the three-in-one combination, have held study sessions and discussions. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and further carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters. Many schools have set up columns for big-character posters for revolutionary criticism, launching fierce attacks and criticism against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

The fighters of the "Smash the Old Beijing Municipal Party Committee Combat Team" have been busy in recent days, pasting big-character posters for revolutionary criticism on major streets throughout the city, launching fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev, and exposing and criticizing the crimes of the Peng Dehuai anti-revolutionary revisionist clique in usurping the party and the country and restoring capitalism.

The revolutionary cultural warriors of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, through studying the new battle call of the central party, have broken through the obstacles of small-groupism, changed the past situation where various mass organizations acted on their own and dispersed their forces, and six revolutionary organizations have jointly established a revolutionary criticism editorial group, together launching the struggle of revolutionary criticism.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in various systems such as industry, transportation, urban construction, and finance and trade in Beijing have repeatedly studied the extremely important speech of the central party leaders and the important resolution of the municipal revolutionary committee with great excitement. Representatives of the "Red East" Brigade of the Mao Zedong Thought in the Beijing Power Plant and leaders of the Red Flag Detachment of the Beijing Clock and Watch Factory have expressed that at this important juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must fully implement the instructions of the central party leaders.

In studying and discussing the new battle call of the central party, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the capital have also pointed out that at this important juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, we must never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. We must not relax our revolutionary vigilance and must strengthen our awareness of the enemy. We must prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from sowing discord and taking advantage of the chaos to sabotage the revolution and production. We must resolutely suppress the various sabotage activities of the class enemies and resolutely support the disbandment of the "May 16 Corps," which is manipulated by a handful of bad leaders, to ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 5th, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary fighters, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, who have unlimited love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, are swiftly implementing the important battle call issued by the central party leaders based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They unanimously expressed their determination to take swift action, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-reform in their own units, and further develop and consolidate the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the revolutionary criticism, consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. They will further implement Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people" and "grasping the revolution and promoting production"; prevent domestic and foreign class enemies from sowing discord and taking advantage of the chaos, resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of the class enemies, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.

After the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an emergency enlarged meeting on the evening of the 3rd and issued the "Important Notice," many revolutionary mass organizations and units such as the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters held emergency meetings overnight to seriously study the extremely important speech of the central party leaders and the "Important Notice" of the municipal revolutionary committee. In recent days, factories, schools, communes, government agencies, military units, shops, and neighborhoods throughout the city have held mobilization and oath-taking meetings. Proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary masses have published articles in newspapers, posted pledge books and determination letters in workshops, shops, campuses, barracks, and dormitories, expressing their determination to invest in the new battle with the firmest, most enthusiastic, most active, and swiftest attitude.

The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters expressed their determination to be a model in implementing the battle call of the central party, resolutely carrying out revolutionary criticism in factories, workshops, teams, and construction sites, making the revolutionary criticism more detailed and solid, and carrying out the struggle-criticism-reform in their own units. In the revolutionary criticism, they will further develop and consolidate the great alliance and the three-in-one combination. They also expressed their determination to vigorously carry out the support-the-army movement.

The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial, transportation, and financial and trade fronts in Shanghai, who are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and are fighting against the high temperatures, have also expressed their determination to further grasp the revolution and promote production in the current unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, striving for double victories in revolution and production, and working hard to complete the national plan for this year ahead of schedule and in excess.

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of the universities and colleges in Shanghai immediately took action upon hearing the battle call of the central party leaders. The "Fight to the End" Brigade of Jiaotong University held an emergency mobilization and oath-taking meeting to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and grasp the direction of the struggle.

The leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of East China Normal University and the Red Guards of New Normal University pointed out that among a thousand important things, revolutionary criticism is the most important! Among a thousand things to grasp, if you don't grasp revolutionary criticism, you are grasping at nothing! Among a thousand things to be busy with, if you don't busy yourself with revolutionary criticism, you are busy with nothing! We will take all effective measures to recall all teachers and students who have gone to other places, and withdraw our liaison agencies set up in other places.

The Red Guards of Huangpu District held a mobilization meeting yesterday afternoon, promptly conveying the speech of the central party leaders and the spirit of the emergency enlarged meeting of the municipal revolutionary committee to the Red Guard leaders of various middle schools in Huangpu District.

The officers and soldiers of the Shanghai Garrison Command and the three military departments stationed in Shanghai have expressed their determination to invest in the revolutionary criticism movement with the most resolute, enthusiastic, active, and swift combat posture, pursuing and attacking the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev; to carry out love-the-people activities more deeply and widely; to maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, strengthen war preparedness, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate any daring enemy!
