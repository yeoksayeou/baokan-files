Military and Civilians United in Struggle

The People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County and revolutionary youngsters have launched a new high tide in the movement to support the military and love the people, and have designated September as the month to support the military and love the people.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an on the 2nd, the People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County in Shaanxi Province and the "101" Revolutionary Rebel Corps and other leftist mass organizations have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and love the people," launching a new high tide in the movement to support the military and love the people.

Recently, after earnestly studying a series of editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on the need to launch a more extensive movement to support the military and love the people, the People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County and the revolutionary masses of "101" quickly pushed the activities to support the military and love the people to a new high tide. The revolutionary youngsters of "101" have been actively engaged in various activities in recent days to express their deep affection for the People's Liberation Army. They have gone to the streets and countryside to extensively publicize the moving deeds of the People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County in firmly supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The cadres and soldiers of the Armed Forces Department, in addition to performing their daily work and duties, have also joined the revolutionary fighters of "101" and others in studying the works of Chairman Mao, carrying out criticism and struggle, and helping them to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Many cadres and soldiers have worked day and night with the revolutionary youngsters in common struggle.

In recent days, the revolutionary fighters of "101" and the cadres and soldiers of the Armed Forces Department have held grand meetings. The revolutionary fighters of "101" said, "We must always believe in the PLA, rely on the PLA, and learn from the PLA's unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, unyielding loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will be models in supporting the military." The cadres and soldiers of the People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County also firmly declared to the revolutionary fighters: "We will always stand on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and be their strong backing."

The revolutionary fighters of "101" and the People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County have jointly decided to designate September as the month to support the military and love the people, and to carry out the movement to support the military and love the people in a more solid, in-depth, and extensive manner.
