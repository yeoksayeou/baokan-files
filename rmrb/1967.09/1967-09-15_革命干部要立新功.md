Revolutionary cadres must achieve new merits

Feng Guozhu, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and committed errors in direction and line. Chairman Mao said, “Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser. Our work is then done better. Any party or individual will inevitably make mistakes. We demand fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we demand that they be corrected, and the quicker and more thoroughly they are corrected, the better.” Following Chairman Mao’s teachings, I resolutely correct my mistakes. Under the education and help of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, I have returned to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and participated in the leadership work of the revolutionary “three-in-one” combination.

Looking back, my ideological transformation was a process. Initially, when I was criticized by the revolutionary masses, I felt aggrieved and unyielding, always feeling that the revolutionary masses had gone too far, wanting to lie down and not do anything, waiting for a resolution. After examining my mistakes, I thought I was useless, and my mood was very depressed. This was accepting lessons from a negative perspective, not the correct attitude. For a period after participating in the leadership work of the “three-in-one” combination, I had the attitude of not seeking merit but only avoiding blame, willing to be an assistant, willing to be a strategist, but not willing to be a leader, even less willing to be the first in command.

Why is this? Mainly because I mistakenly thought that things are hard to do now. If a problem is not handled well, if a task has flaws, or even if a meeting is not conducted well, it might lead to being “rebelled against” or “attacked.” Therefore, in my mind, the word “fear” comes first—fear of this, fear of that. Ultimately, it is the fear of taking responsibility, fear of making mistakes, actually fearing the revolution, fearing the masses.

The existence of these ideological emotions is mainly due to the fact that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been thoroughly eliminated from my mind. I do not fully understand the importance and far-reaching significance of this great proletarian cultural revolution. I am not yet accustomed to the vigorous mass movement and the lively political situation. Ultimately, it is the “self” that is at play, always revolving around the “I.”

Through further help from the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s teachings on not relying on past merits but achieving new merits. Recently, Vice Chairman Lin issued the call to “hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” These profound instructions have deeply educated me, making me realize that my ideological emotions are wrong. After intense ideological struggle, I began to replace the word “difficult” with “do,” replace the word “fear” with “dare,” replace the word “self” with “public,” and work with the revolutionary cadres to overcome difficulties, take on heavy responsibilities, promote revolution, and advance production.

Through a period of work, I deeply felt that the party and the masses have placed us in the position of revolutionary leadership work of the “three-in-one” combination. This is their trust in us and also a higher demand on us. We should dare to work, dare to lead, dare to take responsibility, not fear making mistakes, not fear being “rebelled against,” not fear the masses. If there are flaws and mistakes in our work, the revolutionary masses rising up to “rebel” is a good thing, a normal revolutionary phenomenon. This is the masses, under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, fully mobilized, a concrete manifestation of the masses’ high sense of responsibility for socialist causes, and also the masses’ supervision and education of us revolutionary cadres. As long as we follow the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, work with the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and be the students of the masses, any difficulty can be overcome. I have already tasted the sweetness of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses. The spirit of the revolutionary masses in the cultural revolution—daring to think, dare to speak, dare to venture, dare to do, dare to revolutionize, and dare to rebel—has greatly inspired and educated me. As long as we revolutionary cadres combine with the revolutionary masses, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in our work, resolutely implement Chairman Mao’s mass line, and adhere to the socialist direction, then in the revolutionary “three-in-one” combination, we can and should play a core role.

The editorial comment from the editorial board of _Wei Dong_ at Nankai University, “We Must Boldly Use Revolutionary Cadres,” is the greatest help and encouragement from the revolutionary youngsters. The revolutionary youngsters demand that we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely step forward, and throw ourselves into the great struggle to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The recent editorial in _People’s Daily_, “An Extremely Important Policy Issue,” reflects our great leader Chairman Mao’s policy on cadres. This is the party central committee’s education, encouragement, and exhortation to us.

We, all revolutionary cadres, and all cadres who want revolution and are willing to correct mistakes, should unconditionally execute Chairman Mao’s instructions, resolutely respond to the great call of the party central committee, bravely stand up, stand out, and stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, stand on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, sweep away all negative waiting emotions, all emotions of fear and retreat, and all emotions of not seeking merit but only avoiding blame. We must wholeheartedly achieve new merits and build new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 革命干部要立新功

    革命干部要立新功	上海市革命委员会常委　冯国柱
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了方向、路线错误。毛主席说，“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我按照毛主席的教导，坚决改正自己的错误，在无产阶级革命派和革命群众的教育和帮助下，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来，并且参加了革命“三结合”的领导工作。
    回想起来，我的思想转变是有一个过程的。开始，当我受到革命群众批判的时候，有委屈不服的情绪，总感到革命群众把问题搞过头了，想躺倒不干，等待处理。在检查了自己的错误以后，又以为自己什么都不行了，心情十分低沉。这是从消极方面来接受教训，不是正确的态度。在参加了“三结合”领导工作后的一段时间里，我又有不求有功、但求无过的情绪，愿当助手，愿当参谋，不愿当领导，更不愿当第一把手。
    为什么这样呢？主要是我错误地认为现在事情难办，处理一个问题不很妥当，主持一项工作有缺点，甚至一个会开得不很好，就可能被“造反”、被冲击。因此思想上“怕”字当头，怕这样，怕那样，怕来怕去，无非是怕负责任，怕犯错误，实际上是怕革命，怕群众。
    这些思想情绪的存在，主要是由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒在我的头脑里还没有彻底肃清，对这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的重要性和深远意义还理解不够，对轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动，对生动活泼的政治局面，还感到不是那么习惯。归根结底仍旧是“私”字作怪，处处离不开一个“我”字。
    经过革命派和革命群众进一步的帮助，我又反复学习了毛主席不要吃老本，要立新功的教导。最近，林副主席又发出了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的号召。这些语重心长的伟大指示，深深地教育了我，使我认识到自己的思想情绪是错误的。经过剧烈的思想斗争，开始把“难”字换成“干”字，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“私”字换成“公”字，与革命派在一起战困难，挑重担，抓革命，促生产。
    通过一段时间的工作，我深刻地体会到，党和群众把我们放到“三结合”的革命领导工作岗位上，这是对我们的信任，也是对我们的更高要求。我们就应该敢于工作，敢于领头，敢于负责任，不怕犯错误，不怕“造反”，不怕群众。我们工作中有缺点错误，革命群众起来“造反”，是个大好事，是革命的正常现象。这是群众在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下充分发动起来的表现，是群众对社会主义事业有高度责任感的具体体现，也是群众对我们革命干部的监督和教育。只要我们紧跟战无不胜的毛泽东思想，和群众在一起，虚心向群众学习，做群众的小学生，什么困难都是可以战胜的。我已经开始尝到了相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众的甜头。革命群众在文化大革命中敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，给了我极大的鼓舞和教育。只要我们革命干部和革命群众相结合，在工作中高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的群众路线，坚持社会主义方向，那么在革命的“三结合”中，是可以而且应该起到骨干作用和核心作用的。
    南开大学《卫东》编辑部评论员文章《要大胆使用革命干部》，是革命小将对我们的最大的帮助和鼓励。革命小将们要求我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，勇敢地站出来，投身到革命的大批判中来，参加彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗。《人民日报》最近发表了《一个极其重要的方针性问题》的社论，体现了我们伟大领袖毛主席的干部政策，这是党中央对我们的教育、鼓舞和鞭策。
    我们一切革命干部和一切要革命的、犯错误而愿意改正的干部，应该不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示，坚决响应党中央的伟大号召，勇敢地站起来，站出来，站到无产阶级革命派一边，站到毛主席的革命路线一边。我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，扫除一切消极等待的情绪、畏难退缩的情绪和不求有功但求无过的情绪，全心全意地在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功，建新劳。
