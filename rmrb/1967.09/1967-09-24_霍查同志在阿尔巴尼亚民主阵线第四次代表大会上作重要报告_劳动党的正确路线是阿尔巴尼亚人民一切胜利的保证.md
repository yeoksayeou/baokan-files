The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will sweep away the Chinese Khrushchev clique and set a great example for the overthrow of revisionist cliques in power all over the world. China will forever be a powerful base for world revolution. The Communist Party of China will forever be the banner bearer of Marxism-Leninism. The unbreakable Marxist-Leninist friendship binds the two parties and peoples of Albania and China together. The revolution of the peoples of all countries against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is irresistibly advancing and will achieve new victories.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: According to a report from the Albanian News Agency, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, recently delivered an important report titled "On the Role and Tasks of the Democratic Front in the Struggle for the Complete Victory of Socialism in Albania" at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front.

Comrade Hoxha said, our congress is convened at a time when the socialist revolution in our country is being carried out successfully in all fields along the road laid down by the Fifth Congress of the Party. In all parts of our country, remarkable movements and initiatives have emerged, which have further revolutionized people's consciousness and world outlook, as well as their lives and work. In our country and in the life of our people, profound political, ideological, and economic transformations are taking place. Today we live in a great and unprecedented period of creativity, a creativity that is unleashed by the revolutionary people under the inspiration of revolutionary ideas and the leadership of the Party.

Comrade Hoxha then spoke about the historic role played by the Front in the liberation of the motherland, the defense of national independence, and the construction of socialism. He pointed out that the experience accumulated by the Front over the past twenty-five years has great theoretical and practical importance.

Comrade Hoxha said: Under the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, the sole guiding and leading force is the Party of Labour. Without the Party of Labour and its leadership, the Front, like other mass organizations, would not be able to become a true democratic organization of the people that expresses and defends the interests of the masses.

Although there are specific historical circumstances in our country that have their peculiarities, our Party's policy towards the Front and our experience in this regard once again confirm some basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism, which are indispensable for the victorious realization of the national liberation, revolutionary, and socialist cause.

The experience of our country also proves that, whether in the struggle for national liberation and democratic revolution or in the struggle for proletarian revolution and the construction of socialist and communist society, only a Marxist-Leninist party—a party that is constantly revolutionary, steadfast in its ideological principles, and an organized vanguard of the working class—can lead the country and the people to victory.

The experience of our country and the experience of the world liberation and revolutionary movement confirm: In the imperialist stage, the bourgeoisie and its parties, due to their class nature, cannot carry through the struggle for genuine national liberation or democratic anti-feudal revolution. The Khrushchevites, Titoites, and other modern revisionists deny the leading role of the proletarian party in the revolution and the construction of socialism. They propagate that under the leadership of other bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties and under the leadership of trade unions serving the capitalist monopolies, the people can transition to socialism. This teaching is a complete betrayal of Marxist-Leninist principles and a betrayal of the working class and its revolutionary cause.

To achieve victory in the cause of liberation and revolution, the Marxist-Leninist party must unite all revolutionary forces under its leadership and form a broad people's front. The alliance of the working class and the laboring peasantry is the core and the foundation of the united front. Without this alliance, there is no people's front, no national liberation front.

The Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, when cooperating with other parties in the struggle for national liberation and democratic revolution, must ensure its full independence in thought, politics, and organization. It must not stand aside, must not drift with the current, and must not dissolve into the front. Instead, it must struggle to ensure leadership and fight for leadership. At the same time, it must never forget the prospects of revolutionary development and the realization of the ultimate goal.

The establishment of a broad people's front should not become the basis for spreading such opportunistic and reformist illusions that: supposedly, by obtaining a majority among the masses and in the bourgeois parliament, one can naturally and peacefully transform the existing social system and ensure the victory of the revolution and the transition to socialism. On the contrary, the front established in the process of revolutionary struggle must serve to educate, politically unite, and mobilize the people to participate in the cause of armed struggle, so as to overthrow the imperialists, occupiers, and domestic reactionary classes by force, because history has proven that the imperialists, occupiers, and domestic reactionary classes will never voluntarily give up their positions. Violent revolution is not only a universal law of proletarian revolution but also a universal law of every true democratic and liberation revolution of our time. The so-called peaceful path advocated by the Khrushchev and Tito revisionists will only lead the proletarian party, revolution, and socialism to failure.

The modern revisionists, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals of serving the bourgeoisie and imperialism, are even more frantically pushing the Communist parties and socialist states down the road of degeneration. They are canceling the proletarian class nature of the working-class party by denying it and declaring the working-class party to be a "party of the whole people." In fact, they have already turned the working-class party into a new type of bourgeois party.

The twenty-five-year experience of the Democratic Front shows that our Party has consistently pursued a correct line, successfully defending and implementing the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the laws of proletarian revolution and socialist construction. This guarantees that our Party and the people of our country have achieved all the great victories we enjoy today. The experience up to now also shows, as stipulated by the Fifth Congress of the Party, that the Front is still today the main link in politically uniting the people around the Party and the people's power to build socialism and defend the motherland; it is a great platform for explaining the Party's line to the working people and educating the working people with the Party's line; it is a powerful means of mobilizing the broad masses of workers to actively participate in supervising and solving major social and national problems.

Comrade Hoxha spoke about the current tasks of the Democratic Front in implementing the thoughts and resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party. He said, the Fifth Congress of the Party has formulated a grand program of work and struggle for all communists and all working people in our country. The realization of this program will mark a new and important step forward in the comprehensive construction of socialist society.

When talking about the role of the Democratic Front in further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and expanding socialist democracy, Comrade Hoxha said: The experience of our free and independent motherland shows that without the dictatorship of the proletariat, the achievements of the revolution cannot be guaranteed, the resistance and activities of domestic and foreign enemies cannot be crushed and suppressed, the defense of the socialist motherland cannot be guaranteed, and the task of building socialist and communist society cannot be carried out.

The struggle against bureaucracy, which is currently being successfully carried out in our country, is clearing and opening the way for the greatest development of proletarian democracy, strengthening its revolutionary and popular character, and raising this struggle to a higher stage. In this struggle, the Democratic Front must do a great deal of work to enable the people to express their opinions fearlessly on every matter.

When talking about the international situation, Comrade Hoxha said, the People's Republic of Albania stands like a rock, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, building socialism. At present, we clearly see that the American imperialists, in order to realize their global strategy of ruling the world, are expanding their aggression.

The intensified aggression of American imperialism is not only due to the nature of imperialism to invade and enslave but is also related to the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists. This betrayal has encouraged American big capitalists, reactionaries in various countries, and all anti-communist and counter-revolutionary forces in the world, giving them great hope. They fully understand that their aggressive actions will not only not be opposed by the Khrushchev revisionist clique but will even be supported. The U.S.-Soviet alliance is one of the main characteristics of the current international situation, aiming to re-divide spheres of influence and for the two "superpowers" to dominate the world.

The meeting between President Johnson and the traitor Kosygin in Glassboro marked the entry of this evil alliance into a very dangerous new stage. It was in Glassboro that new plots against socialism, peace, and the freedom of the peoples of all countries were hatched.

The consequences of this meeting are now manifest in several ways: the further escalation of the aggression against Vietnam; the intensification of pressure to impose a solution favorable to Israel and the U.S.-Soviet division of spheres of influence on the Arab countries; the joint proposal by the U.S. and the Soviet Union for a treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons; and the renewed campaign of slander and provocation against the People's Republic of China.

To achieve their common agreement, American imperialism and Soviet revisionism have used every trick. At every moment, they use their puppets and lackeys, from Pope Paul to the traitor, old spy, and conspirator Tito, and Indira Gandhi. These people directly obey the governments of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, running from one country to another, making a great deal of noise, and using various means and methods to deceive world public opinion, shake the resolve of the revolutionary peoples of various countries, and attempt to make the revolutionary peoples of various countries surrender and submit to the rule of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

However, the development of events also confirms that the revolution is irresistibly advancing. It is sweeping away all obstacles and difficulties, destroying the plans of imperialist slavery and aggression, and increasingly becoming a mortal threat to imperialism. The class struggle and the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and its tool—the modern revisionists—has almost engulfed all continents, fundamentally shaking the rotten capitalist society and colonial system, and proclaiming that a great upheaval and victory of the revolution are inevitable in all countries.

The peoples of all countries have awakened, and they are full of confidence in their strength and in bravely fighting against imperialism head-on and defeating it. The experience of struggle has taught them that their common, main, and most ferocious enemy is American imperialism. Experience tells them that the Khrushchev revisionists are not their allies and supporters but are dangerous false friends, servants, and allies of imperialism and reaction, and must be mercilessly exposed and fought against. Experience also shows that the imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries, no matter how strong they appear on the surface, are rotten and weak in the face of the increasingly strong power of the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of various countries.

The imperialist-revisionist front has also fallen into deep contradictions, which are weakening the imperialist-revisionists from within. Europe is a typical stage for these deep contradictions, chaos, and the fierce struggle of the imperialist-revisionist hyenas. The Soviet revisionists and others are loudly proclaiming their deceptive slogans: "peace in Europe," "security in Europe," "nuclear-free zones," and so on. In reality, Europe has become a vast arena where capitalist, imperialist, and revisionist groups are competing, creating conflicts, making deals, and betraying the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the peoples of Europe and the world.

Each of these groups is trying to sell others or themselves at a high price to the United Nations or others. Johnson has already built "bridges" to the Soviet Union and other countries ruled by revisionists, and now trains can pass freely. All the revisionists are selling their peoples and their countries to the imperialists and are trying to use the ostrich method to cover up their betrayal.

But what decides everything is the revolution. The revolution will once and for all smash the enemies of the peoples of all countries. Like a storm, the revolution is brewing, developing, and strengthening. The sooner, the more violent, and the more merciless the storm comes, the sooner humanity will be freed from the hands of the enemy. Therefore, we must stand up and make a revolution, smash our enemies, no matter where they are and whatever disguise they wear, we must tear off their masks and bury them with fire and revolution.

Comrade Hoxha exposed the treacherous policy of the Soviet and some Eastern European countries' revisionist leadership, which is surrendering to imperialism abroad and restoring capitalism at home.

He condemned the Soviet revisionists and the revisionist groups in power in Europe for trading the vital interests of the German Democratic Republic with imperialism. They have placed her in a position of being attacked by a secretly planned conspiracy, and every day they are constantly carrying out this conspiracy from all sides until they finally sell her out completely. He pointed out that the German Democratic Republic and the true Marxist-Leninists of Germany must oppose this betrayal. The people of Albania and their Party of Labour support and will always support the just cause of the German Democratic Republic.

He said, due to this policy of betrayal, not only the socialist system but also the national independence of some Eastern European countries are at stake. In these circumstances, the brotherly peoples of these countries cannot stand idly by waiting for disaster to strike. First and foremost, the great people of the Soviet Union cannot do so. Fifty years after the great October Socialist Revolution, which was led by Lenin and Stalin and opened the era of human liberation from all oppression and exploitation, a clique of traitors has brought the Soviet Union back to the road of capitalist restoration, turning the glorious Soviet state from a fortress of revolution and freedom for the peoples of the world in the heroic era of the Bolsheviks into an imperialist state that extinguishes the flames of revolutionary struggle.

The Soviet people cannot but be indignant at the vile lies and dirty tricks of the Khrushchevites. Because the Khrushchevites, on the one hand, have completely colluded with American imperialism and all reactionaries, and on the other hand, are frantically conspiring against the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of China, against all Marxist-Leninist parties, against the revolution and freedom of the peoples of all countries.

The Party of Labour of Albania, the Communist Party of China, the people of Albania, the people of China, and all Marxist-Leninists have bravely and resolutely smashed all the conspiracies of the Khrushchev revisionists. They will not allow these dangerous traitors and close collaborators of imperialism to realize their various vile plots against us. The supreme interests of Marxism-Leninism, world revolution, and socialism require all true revolutionaries and all communists who are loyal to the glorious doctrine of Marxism-Leninism to resolutely stand up and thoroughly expose the "anti-imperialist" and "socialist" masks of the Khrushchev revisionist leaders, so as to expose the extremely vile true face of these traitors, conspirators, and close collaborators of imperialism and reactionaries of all countries in the light of day.

The People's Republic of Albania, which consistently pursues a revolutionary foreign policy, has never been indifferent to international events, neither in the past nor in the present. Our Party and government have courageously expressed their attitude towards these international events, thus, as always, contributing to the struggle for the maintenance of peace in Europe and the world, to the denunciation of the policy of aggression and enslavement of the imperialists, and to the denunciation of the counter-revolutionary policy of betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists. Our Party and government condemn and will always condemn all the deals of the imperialists and revisionists to harm the peoples of all countries, and will unreservedly support the anti-imperialist struggle for liberation, and will unremittingly strengthen the unity with all forces that struggle against imperialism, reaction, and revisionism.

In his report, Comrade Hoxha warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and the fighting friendship between the two parties and the two countries of Albania and China. He said, the unbreakable Marxist-Leninist friendship binds the people, Party, and government of Albania with the great People's Republic of China, with the glorious Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong. We two parties and two peoples maintain this ever-strengthening friendship. The People's Republic of China is advancing victoriously on the road of revolution and socialist construction. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is being carried out with comprehensive victories, fighting against open or hidden revisionists and all class enemies, further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. China has become the main and invincible fortress of revolution and socialism in Asia and the world, and has become the banner bearer of Marxism-Leninism in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism, and against various reactionary groups. Precisely for this reason, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have directed their strategic and counter-revolutionary activities against the People's Republic of China. Therefore, they desperately surround China with the circle of reactionary forces and the fire of aggressive war, going mad and screaming, attacking and slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great and glorious teacher of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. Therefore, they are terrified of China's explosion of atomic and hydrogen bombs, of all the progress and achievements of the Chinese people on the road of revolution.

If the enemy insists on going its own way, let them go mad and tremble. No force in the world can stop the 700 million Chinese people from advancing on the road to socialism and communism. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will sweep away the Chinese Khrushchev clique, turning the beautiful dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sets a great example for the overthrow of revisionist cliques in power all over the world. The People's Republic of China will forever be an unshakable fortress of socialism and a powerful base for revolution. The Communist Party of China will forever be the banner bearer of Marxism-Leninism.

We are filled with joy at the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. We are proud to have such a loyal and powerful ally and friend. No matter what storms and waves come from anywhere, they cannot weaken or damage the unbreakable friendship between our two countries and parties, which is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We consider it our duty to reiterate that the ironclad unity of all Marxist-Leninist forces and all revolutionary forces in the world with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China is an objective necessity of historical significance for the revolution of the peoples of all countries and for the fate of the struggle for socialism and freedom.

Comrade Hoxha said, our people, our Party, and government will unremittingly and unreservedly support the struggle for liberation of the Vietnamese people. We have always regarded and will always regard this struggle as our own struggle, as a struggle for the common cause of revolution and socialism.

The armed struggle of the Vietnamese people is a heavy blow to American imperialism and a great obstacle to the implementation of its plunder plan. The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in this struggle have completely shattered the myth of military strength and the superiority of modern weapons.

The Vietnam War has also exposed the false face of the Khrushchev revisionists. This war has fully revealed their policy of surrender, deception, hypocrisy, and demagoguery. It has been proven that the purpose of the revisionists is not to aid the Vietnamese people in liberating the South and unifying the country, but to save the U.S. imperialists, helping them to stay in Vietnam and turning Vietnam into a base for attacking the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries. The Khrushchev revisionists want to play the role of the Trojan horse in Vietnam. They have plotted various evil conspiracies and tricks, applying pressure and blackmail from all sides, trying to force Vietnam to accept Johnson's "peace talks." But they could not, and will never be able to, shake the resolve of the Vietnamese people. They will never be able to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation.

We have already publicly declared that the attitude towards Vietnam is a clear dividing line between imperialists and the people, Marxist-Leninists and revisionists. Supporting and aiding the struggle of the Vietnamese people is not, as the revisionists think, an act of generosity; it is a great internationalist duty of all revolutionaries. To make the aid to Vietnam genuine and effective, it is necessary to strongly refute the deceptive and deceiving slogans put forward by the Khrushchev revisionists, such as "joint aid to Vietnam" or "anti-imperialist united front." It is necessary to resolutely and thoroughly expose and smash the policy of betrayal and deception of the Soviet revisionists. This is a prerequisite and an indispensable condition for the Vietnamese people to achieve victory in their struggle against the Americans.

Comrade Hoxha said, our people will always support the just struggle of the peoples of the Arab countries against American imperialism and its tool, Israel. We are confident that the peoples of these countries will first rely on their own strength, and at the same time rely on the support of the revolutionary peoples of all countries, not believing in the false friends, the Khrushchev revisionists and the Tito revisionists, and will thus overcome all temporary difficulties, defeat the invaders, and achieve a complete victory over the imperialists and their lackeys. Whether in times of success or difficulty, the people of Albania now and in the future will always stand by their side.

Comrade Hoxha said, the revolutionary foreign policy of our Party and government is fully supported by all the people of Albania united in the Democratic Front. Due to the pursuit of this policy, the People's Republic of Albania has gained the international prestige it deserves and has sincere friends and supporters all over the world.

Socialist Albania is a country that loves peace and does not want to threaten or intimidate anyone. The People's Republic of Albania, through its just and correct foreign policy, has always sought to maintain normal neighborly relations with its three neighboring countries. If a neighboring country does not like this normal and correct neighborly relationship, this is not our fault, and it is of no importance to us. Socialism will continue to flourish in Albania.

Comrade Hoxha exposed the territorial ambitions of the Greek monarch-fascist regime against Albania. He said: We warn the Greek monarch-fascists and their friends: behave yourselves, because history does not repeat itself. Whoever invades our sacred borders will perish.

We warn the Greek monarch-fascists: whether in the past or today, the Albanians are not afraid. The Albanian people and the Party of Albania are defending the borders and territory of Albania. Whoever dares to touch Albania will have no return.

We also have a word for the Greek monarch-fascists and the American imperialists and their accomplices and instigators of their crimes. The borders of Albania are inviolable, because they are defended by the brave people and the Party of the Land of the Eagles, which will smash the invaders; and Albania is not isolated. If you invade our borders, you must understand that the aid to socialist Albania to defend Albania knows no borders.

The modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionists are allies of American imperialism and the Greek monarch-fascist parties, therefore, shedding crocodile tears and boasting about the Warsaw Pact, this scrap of paper, to supposedly aid Albania, are all in vain. The Albanians see through you, even if you put on nuclear teeth. We are not afraid of you. In our Albania, crocodile tears, the Warsaw Pact, and your false aid in times of danger are all useless. Any danger, if it falls on us, we will successfully deal with it. If you stab us with a dagger behind your deceptive words, we will aim our guns at you, and our gunshots will be heard in the Soviet Union and your country, where the thunderous blows of the heroic Leninists and those who support Stalin, and the brave brotherly people of the Soviet Union, will strike you like lightning. Then, it will be your doomsday.

Comrade Hoxha said: Socialist Albania will live freely and independently for generations to come. She will forever be an example of the heroic spirit and vitality of the outstanding and patriotic people. The Albanian people, united around their heroic Party of Labour, have strongly united in the Democratic Front over these twenty-five years, creating a strong and inviolable new Albania. Albania has gained the love of sincere friends and the revolutionary peoples of the world.

    霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上作重要报告
　　劳动党的正确路线是阿尔巴尼亚人民一切胜利的保证
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团树立伟大的范例。中国将永远是世界革命的强大基地。中国共产党将永远是马克思列宁主义的旗手。牢不可破的马克思列宁主义友谊，把阿中两党两国人民联结在一起。各国人民反对美帝苏修的革命正在势不可挡地前进，必将取得新的胜利。
    新华社二十三日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志最近在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上作了《关于民主阵线在争取社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚完全胜利的斗争中的作用和任务》的重要报告。
    霍查同志说，我们的代表大会是在我国的社会主义革命，正沿着党第五次代表大会所规定的道路，在各个领域卓有成效地深入开展的时候召开的。我国各地出现了了不起的运动和首创精神，使人们的觉悟和世界观以及他们的生活和工作进一步革命化，在我国和我国人民的生活中，正在进行深刻的政治、思想和经济的改造。今天我们生活在伟大的空前未有的创造性的时期，这种空前的创造性，是革命的人民在受到革命思想鼓舞的党的领导下发挥出来的。
    霍查同志接着谈到了阵线对解放祖国、保卫民族独立和建设社会主义方面所起的具有历史意义的作用。他指出，阵线成立以来的二十五年所积累的经验，具有伟大的理论方面和实践方面的重要性。
    霍查同志说：在我国无产阶级专政制度下唯一的指导和领导力量是劳动党，如果没有劳动党及其领导作用，那么阵线也会和其他群众组织一样，不能成为表达和维护群众利益的真正民主的人民的组织。
    尽管我国的具体历史情况有其特殊的地方，但是我们党对阵线所采取的方针和我们在这方面的经验，再一次证实了马克思列宁主义的一些基本学说，这些基本学说是胜利实现民族解放、革命和社会主义事业所不可缺少的。
    我国的经验也证明了，不论是在民族解放和民主革命中，还是在无产阶级革命和建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会的斗争中，只有马克思列宁主义政党——不断革命的、始终忠实于我们学说的意识形态原则的、有觉悟和有组织的工人阶级先锋队，才能领导国家和人民走向胜利。
    我国的经验以及世界解放和革命运动的经验证实：在帝国主义阶段，资产阶级及其政党，由于它们的阶级本性，不可能把争取真正的民族解放的反帝斗争或者民主的反封建革命进行到底。赫鲁晓夫分子、铁托分子和其他现代修正主义者否认无产阶级政党在革命和社会主义建设中的领导作用，他们宣传，在其他资产阶级和小资产阶级政党领导下以及在为资本主义垄断集团效劳的工会领导下，人民也能过渡到社会主义，这种说教是彻头彻尾背叛马克思列宁主义的原则，背叛工人阶级及其革命事业。
    要使解放和革命事业取得胜利，马克思列宁主义政党必须把一切革命力量团结在自己的领导下，组成广泛的人民阵线。工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟是统一战线的核心，是基础的基础。没有这个联盟，就没有人民阵线，就没有民族解放阵线。
    马克思列宁主义共产党在民族解放和民主革命中同其他政党实行合作时，必须确保自己作为一个工人阶级政党在思想上、政治上和组织上的充分的独立性，不应站在一旁，不要随波逐流，决不应溶入阵线之中，而是要进行斗争，以确保领导作用，为取得领导权而斗争。同时，它必须一刻也不忘记革命发展的前景和实现最后目的的前景。
    建立广泛的人民阵线决不应该成为散播这样一些机会主义和改良主义的幻想的基础，即：所谓通过在群众中和在资产阶级议会中取得了多数，就能够自然而然地和平改造现有的社会制度，就能够确保革命的胜利和过渡到社会主义。相反，在革命斗争过程中建立起来的阵线，必须为教育、在政治上团结和动员人民参加武装斗争的事业服务，以便通过暴力手段来推翻帝国主义者、占领者、本国反动阶级，因为历史已经证明，帝国主义者、占领者和本国反动阶级是决不会自动退出他们的阵地的。暴力革命不仅是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，而且也是当代每一个真正的民主和解放革命的普遍规律。赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义者所鼓吹的所谓和平道路（他们已经把这条和平道路宣布为全世界的战略原则），只会使工人阶级政党、革命和社会主义遭受失败。
    现代修正主义者为了实现他们为资产阶级和帝国主义效劳的反革命目的，正在比以前更加狂热地使共产党和社会主义政权在变质的道路上滑下去。他们正在通过否认工人阶级政党的无产阶级的阶级性和宣布工人阶级政党为“全民党”的办法来取消工人阶级政党。事实上，他们已经使工人阶级政党变成了一种新型的资产阶级政党。
    民主阵线二十五年的经验表明，我们党一贯奉行一条正确的路线，她胜利地捍卫和贯彻了马克思列宁主义的原则和无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的规律。这就保证我们党和我国人民取得了我们今天所享有的一切伟大胜利。直到现在的经验也表明，正如党的第五次代表大会所规定的，阵线今天仍然是在政治上把人民团结在党和人民政权周围建设社会主义和保卫祖国的主要环节；是向劳动人民阐明党的路线并以党的路线教育劳动人民的大讲台；是动员广大劳动群众积极参加监督和解决重大的社会和国家问题的强有力的手段。
    霍查同志谈到了民主阵线为实现党的第五次代表大会的思想和决议的当前任务。他说，党的第五次代表大会为我国全体共产党人和全体劳动人民制定了一个宏伟的工作和战斗纲领。这一纲领的实现将标志着在全面建设社会主义社会的道路上又迈出新的重大的一步。
    霍查同志在谈到民主阵线在进一步加强无产阶级专政和扩大社会主义民主方面的作用时说：我们自由和独立的祖国的经验表明，没有无产阶级专政，就不能确保革命成果，就不能粉碎和镇压国内外敌人的反抗和活动，社会主义祖国的国防就得不到保证，建设社会主义和共产主义社会的任务就不能贯彻。
      目前正在我国胜利开展的反对官僚主义的斗争，正在为无产阶级民主的最大发展扫清和开辟道路，正在加强它的革命性和人民性，正在把这一斗争提高到一个更高的阶段。在这一斗争中，民主阵线要做大量的工作，以便让人民能无所畏惧地对每一件事情发表自己的意见。
    霍查同志在谈到国际局势的时候说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国象磐石一样屹立着，一手拿镐一手拿枪进行社会主义建设。目前，我们清楚地看到，美帝国主义者为了实现统治世界的全球战略，正在扩大它的侵略活动。
    美帝国主义者的加紧侵略，不仅出于帝国主义进行侵略和奴役的本性，而且同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛有联系，这种背叛鼓励了美国大资本家、各国反动派、全世界所有反共反革命势力，使他们抱有很大的希望。他们完全了解，他们的侵略行动不仅不遭到赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的反对，相反还会得到支持。苏美联盟是当前国际局势的主要特征之一，其目的在于重新瓜分势力范围，并由两个“超级大国”主宰世界。
    约翰逊总统和叛徒柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的会谈，标志着这个万恶的联盟进入了一个非常危险的新阶段。就是在葛拉斯堡罗策划了针对社会主义、和平和各国人民自由的新阴谋。
    这次会谈的后果现在已在几个方面表现出来：对越南侵略的进一步升级；加紧施加压力以便把有利于以色列和苏美瓜分势力范围的政策的解决办法强加于阿拉伯国家；苏美联合提出防止核扩散条约的草案；再次对中华人民共和国发动诽谤和挑衅的宣传运动。
    为了实现共同的协议，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者什么花招都使出来了。在每一个时刻，他们都利用他们的傀儡、仆从，从教皇保罗起直到叛徒、老特务、阴谋家铁托还有英迪拉·甘地。这些人直接听命于美苏两国政府，从一国跑到另一国，大肆叫嚷，采用各种方式方法来欺骗世界舆论，动摇各国革命人民的决心，企图使各国革命人民投降，并屈从于美苏的统治。
    但是事态的发展同时也证实了，革命正在势不可挡地前进。它正在扫除一切障碍和困难，摧毁帝国主义的奴役、侵略计划，并且越来越成为对帝国主义的致命威胁。阶级斗争和各国人民反对帝国主义及其工具——现代修正主义者的革命解放斗争，几乎席卷各大陆，从根本上动摇了腐朽的资本主义社会和殖民主义制度，宣告了世界各国不可避免地要发生天翻地覆的变化和革命要取得新的胜利。
    各国人民已经觉醒，他们对自己的力量和团结起来勇敢地同帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争并战胜帝国主义，满怀信心。斗争的经验使他们深信，他们共同的、主要的和最凶恶的敌人，就是美帝国主义。经验告诉他们，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不是他们的盟友和支持者，而是危险的假朋友，是帝国主义和反动派的奴仆和同盟军，必须对它进行无情的揭露和斗争。经验还表明，帝国主义者、修正主义者和一切反动派，不管表面上看来多么强大，但在各国人民革命斗争日益增强的力量面前，都是腐朽的和虚弱的。
    帝修阵线也已陷入深刻的矛盾之中，这种矛盾在从内部削弱帝修。欧洲就是充满了这种深刻矛盾、混乱和帝修豺狼们进行激烈斗争的典型舞台。苏联修正主义者和其他一些人在大肆宣扬他们的骗人口号：“欧洲平静”、“欧洲安全”、“无核地区”等等。实际上，欧洲已经成为资本主义、帝国主义和修正主义集团危害欧洲人民和世界人民的自由、主权和独立而进行竞争、闹矛盾、作交易和进行叛卖的广大角斗场所。
    这些集团中的每一个集团，都在竭力设法向联合国或其他人以高价出卖别人或出卖自己。约翰逊已在苏联和修正主义分子统治的其他国家搭了“桥”，现在火车可以畅通无阻。所有的修正主义分子都向帝国主义者出卖他们的人民和他们的国家，并竭力利用鸵鸟的方法来掩盖自己的背叛行为。
    可是，决定一切的是革命，革命将一劳永逸地粉碎各国人民的敌人。象暴风雨一样，革命正在酝酿，在发展，在加强。暴风雨来得越早、越猛烈、越无情，人类就将越加迅速地免遭敌人的毒手。因此我们要挺身而出闹革命，粉碎我们的敌人，不论他们在哪里和披着什么样的伪装，我们要撕下他们的假面具，用烈火和革命来埋葬他们。
    霍查同志揭露了苏联和东欧一些国家的修正主义领导集团对外投降帝国主义、对内复辟资本主义的背叛政策。
      他谴责苏联修正主义者和在欧洲执政的修正主义集团，拿德意志民主共和国的切身利益来同帝国主义做交易。他们把她置于受到暗中策划的一个阴谋的夹攻的地位，他们每天都在不断地从各个方面推行这一阴谋，直到他们最后把她全部出卖时为止。他指出，德意志民主共和国和德国真正的马克思列宁主义者必须反对这种背叛。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其劳动党现在和将来都永远支持德意志民主共和国的正义事业。
    他说，由于这种背叛政策，不仅社会主义制度，而且东欧某些国家的民族独立都成了问题。在这种情况下，这些国家的兄弟人民不能袖手旁观等待灾难的来临。首先，伟大的苏联人民不能这样。在列宁和斯大林领导下开创了人类从一切压迫和剥削中解放出来的时代的伟大十月社会主义革命之后五十年的今天，在社会主义和共产主义胜利的时代，一个叛徒集团竟使苏联回到资本主义复辟的道路，把光荣的苏维埃国家，从布尔什维克的英雄时代的各国人民的革命和自由的堡垒变成一个扑灭革命斗争烈火的帝国主义国家，这是一个莫大的罪行。
    苏联人民不能不对赫鲁晓夫分子的卑鄙的谎言和下流的骗人伎俩感到愤怒。因为赫鲁晓夫分子一方面已同美帝国主义和一切反动派完全勾结在一起，另一方面疯狂地阴谋反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、中华人民共和国，反对各马克思列宁主义政党，反对各国人民的革命和自由。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚人民、中国人民以及所有的马克思列宁主义者，勇敢和坚决地粉碎了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的一切阴谋活动，他们决不容许这些危险的叛徒和帝国主义的亲密合作者实现针对我们的各种卑鄙企图。马克思列宁主义、世界革命和社会主义的最高利益，要求所有真正的革命者和所有忠于马克思列宁主义的光荣学说的共产党人坚决地站出来，彻底揭穿赫鲁晓夫修正主义头目的
  “反帝”和“社会主义”的假面具，以便把这些叛徒、阴谋家、帝国主义和各国反动派的亲密合作者的卑鄙之极的真面目在全世界暴露在光天化日之下。
    坚决奉行遵循革命原则的外交政策的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，过去和现在从来就不是对国际事件无动于衷的。我们党和我国政府，对这些国际事件勇敢地表示了自己的态度，从而一如既往，对为维护欧洲与世界和平的斗争，对声讨帝国主义者的侵略与奴役政策以及赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反革命叛卖政策，作出了自己的贡献。我们党和我国政府谴责了并将永远谴责帝国主义者和修正主义者为危害各国人民而作的一切交易，将毫无保留地支持反帝解放斗争，坚持不懈地加强同为反对帝国主义、反动派和修正主义而斗争的一切力量的团结。
    霍查同志在报告中热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，赞扬阿中两党两国的战斗友谊。他说，牢不可破的马克思列宁主义友谊，把阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和政府同伟大的人民中国，同由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的光荣的中国共产党联结在一起。我们两党和两国人民维护着这种日益增强的友谊。中华人民共和国正在革命和社会主义建设的道路上胜利前进。中国无产阶级文化大革命正在全面胜利地展开，抗击公开的或隐藏的修正主义分子，抗击一切阶级敌人，以进一步加强无产阶级专政。中国已成为亚洲和全世界的革命和社会主义的不可战胜的主要堡垒，已成为反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和反对形形色色的反动集团的斗争中的马克思列宁主义旗手。恰恰是由于这个缘故，美帝和苏修把他们的战略和反革命活动的矛头指向人民中国。因此，他们拚命把反动势力和侵略战争的火力包围圈针对着她，歇斯底里大发作，攻击和诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命和中国人民的伟大和光荣的导师毛泽东同志。因此，他们对中国爆炸原子弹和氢弹，对中国人民在革命的道路上所取得的一切进步和一切成就怕得要死。
    如果敌人一意孤行，那就让他们发疯和发抖吧。世界上没有任何力量能阻挡七亿中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。人民中国将永远是社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒，将永远是革命的强大基地，中国共产党将永远是马克思列宁主义的旗手。
    我们怀着喜悦的心情，对中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志领导下所取得的伟大胜利，表示衷心的敬意。我们为有这样忠实、强大的盟友和朋友而感到自豪。不管来自那里的惊涛骇浪和风暴，都不能削弱和损害我们两国和两党建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则钢铁般的基础上的牢不可破的友谊。我们认为有责任重申，全世界马克思列宁主义力量和一切革命力量同中国共产党和中华人民共和国的钢铁般的团结，对于各国人民的革命以及争取社会主义和自由的命运来说，是具有历史意义的客观需要。
    霍查同志说，我国人民、我们的党和政府将坚持不懈地、毫无保留地支持越南人民的解放斗争，我们过去和现在都把这场斗争看作是我们自己的斗争，看作是为革命和社会主义共同事业服务的斗争。
    越南人民的武装斗争是对美帝国主义的沉重打击，是美帝实现掠夺计划的巨大障碍。越南人民在这场斗争中所取得的重大胜利，彻底粉碎了关于军事力量和现代军备优势的神话。
    越南战争也戳穿了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的假面具，这场战争彻底揭示了他们的投降政策的弄虚作假、伪善和蛊惑人心的伎俩。已经证明，修正主义者的目的不是援助越南人民解放南方和统一祖国，而是要挽救美帝，帮助它赖在越南并且把越南变成用以进攻中华人民共和国及其他亚洲国家的据点。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者想在越南扮演特洛伊木马的角色，他们策划了种种凶恶的阴谋诡计，从各方面施加压力和进行讹诈，企图迫使越南接受约翰逊的“和谈”。但是，他们过去不能、今后也永远不能动摇越南人民的决心，永远也不能扑灭越南人民的解放斗争。
    我们已经有力地公开宣告，对待越南的态度，是区分帝国主义者和人民、马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的明确的分界线。声援和支持越南人民的斗争，不是象修正主义者所认为的那样，是一种慷慨姿态；而是所有革命者的伟大国际主义义务。为了使对越南的援助名副其实，卓有成效，必须有力地驳斥赫鲁晓夫修正主义者提出的“联合援越”或“反帝共同战线”等蛊惑人心的和骗人的口号。坚决彻底揭露和摧毁苏联修正主义者的叛卖和欺骗政策，是越南人民在抗美斗争中取得胜利的前提和不可缺少的先决条件。
    霍查同志说，我国人民将始终支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的正义斗争。我们坚信，这些国家的人民将首先依靠他们自己的力量，同时也依靠各国革命人民的支持，不相信赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和铁托修正主义者这些假朋友，从而胜利地克服一切暂时的困难，消灭侵略者，取得对帝国主义者及其走狗的彻底胜利。不管是在顺利还是在困难的日子里，阿尔巴尼亚人民现在和将来都永远站在他们一边。
    霍查同志说，我们党和我国政府的革命的对外政策，是完全得到团结在民主阵线中的全体阿尔巴尼亚人民的拥护的。由于奉行了这个政策，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国获得了应有的国际威望，在全世界都有真挚的朋友和支持者。
    社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚是一个热爱和平的国家，她不想威胁和恫吓任何人。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国通过她的公正和正确的对外政策，一贯力求同她的三个邻国保持正常的邻国关系。如果一个邻国不喜欢这种正常和正确的邻国关系，这并不是由于我们的过错，这对我们来说是无关紧要的，社会主义照样在阿尔巴尼亚欣欣向荣。
    霍查同志揭露了希腊保皇法西斯当局对阿尔巴尼亚的领土的野心。他说：我们要正告希腊保皇法西斯分子及其朋友们：放老实一点，因为历史是不会重复两次的。谁侵犯我们祖国的神圣边境，就将自取灭亡。
    我们要正告希腊保皇法西斯分子：不论是过去还是今天，阿尔巴尼亚人是吓不倒的。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，保卫着阿尔巴尼亚的边境和阿尔巴尼亚的领土，谁胆敢碰一下阿尔巴尼亚，就有来无回。
    我们还要对希腊保皇法西斯分子和美帝国主义者及其帮凶和唆使他们犯罪的煽动者说一句话。阿尔巴尼亚的边境是不可侵犯的，因为她是由英勇的人民和山鹰之国的党保卫着的，将粉碎来犯者；而且阿尔巴尼亚不是孤立无援的。如果你们侵犯我们的边境，你们必须懂得，为保卫阿尔巴尼亚而给予社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的援助，就没有国界了。
    以苏联修正主义者为首的现代修正主义者是反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的美帝国主义和希腊保皇党法西斯分子的同盟军，因此，洒鳄鱼眼泪和吹嘘华沙条约这张废纸来对阿尔巴尼亚进行所谓援助，都是徒劳的。阿尔巴尼亚人看透了你们，即使你们装上了核牙齿。我们丝毫不怕你们。在我们阿尔巴尼亚，鳄鱼眼泪也好，华沙条约也好，你们在危急的时候的假援助也好，都骗不了我们。任何危险，如果它降临到我们头上，我们将成功地应付它。如果你们在骗人的鬼话背后举起匕首向我们刺过来，我们定将把枪瞄准你们，我们的枪声将在苏联和你们的国家听到，在那里，英雄的列宁主义者和拥护斯大林的人们以及英勇的兄弟的苏联人民的雷霆万钧的打击，将象闪电那样落在你们头上。那时候，就是你们的末日。
    霍查同志说：社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚将世世代代自由地、独立自主地生存下去。她将永远是杰出的和爱国的人民的英雄气概和蓬勃生气的榜样。阿尔巴尼亚人民围绕着自己的英雄的劳动党，坚强地团结在民主阵线中，在这二十五年中已造成一个强大和不可侵犯的新的阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚得到真诚的朋友们和世界革命人民的热爱。
