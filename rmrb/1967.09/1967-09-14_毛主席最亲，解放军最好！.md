The people of Zigong City, in the spirit of "supporting the army and loving the people," enthusiastically recite the moving deeds of the Zigong City Military Sub-district's "three supports, two militaries." In a thousand words, ten thousand words, it all comes down to one sentence: "Chairman Mao is the dearest, the PLA is the best!"

"The PLA is the best" because they listen to Chairman Mao the most, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions the most, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line the most, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and act according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They are models in studying the works of Chairman Mao, models in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and models in defending Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the Zigong City Military Sub-district have done a good job. They organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into workshops and fields to lecture on the "Sixteen Points"; they firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, encouraging revolutionary youngsters to charge into the forefront of the revolutionary criticism; they arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the great unity of the revolutionary masses; they pass on the glorious traditions of the PLA's "four firsts," "three-eighths style," and "three great democracies" to us, strengthening the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary mass organizations; they enthusiastically respond to the great call of "grab revolution, promote production," and fight on the front lines of supporting industry and agriculture, creating the highest production records in the history of Zigong City.

"The PLA is the best" because they have the clearest hatred and love, the firmest stance, are ruthless to the enemy, and gentle to themselves. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution last year, the leading comrades of the Zigong City Military Sub-district understood the great strategic significance of this revolution from Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." From then on, they have been in a resolute struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee and the reactionary line they implemented. They said well: "We are the people's army with Chairman Mao as the highest commander. We have only one headquarters in our hearts, and that is the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the leader. We follow the orders of this headquarters, not the 'decrees' of the bourgeois headquarters." They firmly stand and fight with the proletarian revolutionary masses, winning together. The more difficulties we face, the more the PLA supports us. They said so profoundly: "We are not just protecting a few of your organizations; we are defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

"The PLA is the best" because they are the bravest, most selfless, and fearless. The class enemies hate and fear the PLA's resolute support for the proletarian revolutionary masses to death. They use every means to persecute, instigate, and defame. But the PLA is fearless, issuing an ironclad oath: "Persecution is nothing to fear, as long as our stance is firm, we will always follow Chairman Mao and carry out thorough revolution." In the most difficult days, they recited "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with us: "With firm resolve, fearing neither hardship nor death, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." We draw endless strength from the PLA, enhancing our revolutionary spirit.

"The PLA is the best" because they are heart to heart with the masses, sharing our worries and helping us in our needs. The doors of the Military Sub-district are always open to the revolutionary masses. We work together with the Military Sub-district, and when there are problems, we study them together. They said: "Supporting the left not only means supporting correctly but also supporting well. We do not need praise; we need revolutionary criticism." How humble and profound these words are! Their humble, cautious, selfless, and wholeheartedly serving the people's spirit set a shining example for us.

"The PLA is the best" because they seriously implement the policies formulated by Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. For those who had once opposed them and were misled, they treat them all as class brothers, extending warm hands to help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"Chairman Mao is the dearest, the PLA is the best." This is the voice of our hearts, the conclusion of revolutionary practice. It expresses the most sincere and genuine class feelings of the broad revolutionary masses. Currently, the class enemies are doing their utmost to sow discord between the army and the people, damage the lofty prestige of the People's Liberation Army, and attempt to shift the direction of the struggle and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will not agree to this! We will further raise the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism, and advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

### 毛主席最亲，解放军最好！

    毛主席最亲，解放军最好！
    自贡市广大革命群众高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，竞相传诵着自贡市武装部“三支”“两军”的动人事迹。千句话、万句话，并成一句话：“毛主席最亲，解放军最好！”
    “解放军最好”，因为他们最听毛主席的话，最照毛主席的指示办事，最坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部，最按毛主席的伟大战略部署行动。他们是学习毛主席著作的模范，是宣传毛泽东思想的模范，是捍卫毛泽东思想的模范。自贡市武装部的同志就做得很好。他们组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到车间、田头宣讲“十六条”；他们紧紧把握住斗争的大方向，鼓励革命小将在革命大批判中冲锋陷阵；他们用毛泽东思想武装革命派的头脑，促成了革命派的大联合；他们把解放军的“四个第一”、“三八作风”、“三大民主”等光荣传统传授给我们，加强了革命派队伍中的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性；他们热烈响应“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，奋战在支工、支农的第一线，使自贡市的工农业生产创造了十七年来的最高纪录。
    “解放军最好”，因为他们爱憎最分明，立场最坚定，对敌狠，对己和。去年，文化大革命运动一开始，自贡市武装部的领导同志就从毛主席《炮打司令部》这张大字报中领会了这次革命的伟大战略意义。从此，他们就同旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们所执行的资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。他们说得好：“我们是以毛主席为最高统帅的人民军队，我们心中只有一个司令部，这就是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，我们听的是这个司令部的命令，决不是资产阶级司令部的‘圣旨’”。他们坚定地和无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们越困难，解放军越支持我们。他们说得多么深刻：“我们保护的不仅仅是你们几个组织，我们保卫的是毛主席的革命路线！”
    “解放军最好”，因为他们最勇敢、最无私、最无畏。阶级敌人对解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派恨得要死，怕得要命，想尽各种办法，进行迫害、挑拨、中伤。但是他们无所畏惧，发出了钢铁般誓言：“迫害不要紧，只要立场稳，永跟毛主席，彻底闹革命。”在最艰苦的日子里，他们和我们一起朗诵《毛主席语录》：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们从解放军身上吸取了无穷的力量，增强了革命斗志。
    “解放军最好”，因为他们和群众心连心，急我们之所急，帮我们之所需。武装部的大门，整天为革命派敞开着。我们和武装部，有事大家干，有问题共同研究。他们说：“解放军支左不仅要支得对，还要支得好”，“我们不需要颂扬，需要的是革命的批评。”这是何等谦虚而深刻的话啊！他们谦虚谨慎，不为名，不为利，全心全意为人民服务的精神，给我们树立了光辉的榜样。
    “解放军最好”，因为他们最认真地执行毛主席、党中央、中央军委、中央文革所制定的方针政策。对于曾经反对过他们的那些受蒙蔽的群众，他们一律视为阶级弟兄，伸出温暖的手，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线一边。
    “毛主席最亲，解放军最好。”这是我们内心的声音，是革命实践的结论。它表达了广大革命群众最朴素最真挚的阶级感情。当前，阶级敌人竭力挑拨军民关系，破坏人民解放军的崇高威望，妄图转移斗争大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们坚决不答应！我们将进一步高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，沿着毛主席的革命路线乘胜前进。		四川省自贡市		无产阶级革命造反司令部　贫下中农革命造反司令部		机关革命造反司令部　红色公安革命造反司令部
