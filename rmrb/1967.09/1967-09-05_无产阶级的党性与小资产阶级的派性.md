Currently, in some revolutionary mass organizations, there is a wrong tendency of sectarianism prevailing over party spirit, which must be immediately stopped.

Sectarianism prevailing over party spirit means using the interests of one's own group or faction as the "highest criterion" for handling issues, forgetting the overall interests of the proletarian revolution, forgetting the overall situation of the revolution, and having only one's own organization and faction in mind. They constantly engage in sectarianism, leading to various wrong actions.

Towards the directives of the proletarian headquarters, they adopt a utilitarian attitude. They listen and act only if it suits their needs; they ignore and do not act if it does not. They even use methods like cutting off the head and tail, taking sentences out of context, and using certain phrases from the directives of the proletarian headquarters to serve their own faction's interests.

Towards the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, they adopt an unprincipled attitude. Those who agree with their views are "comrades" and "revolutionary cadres"; those who disagree with their views are "enemies" and "four-category cadres." Whoever agrees with their views today is treated as a close comrade; whoever disagrees with their views tomorrow is subjected to ruthless struggle.

Towards themselves, they always think, "I am the best," "I am the most revolutionary," "I am the most radical." They only know how to organize their own faction's strength to "attack" other organizations, but they have never conducted a proper self-criticism.

If we allow this sectarian trend to spread in the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces, it will confuse right and wrong, turn serious political struggles into unprincipled factional disputes, divert the direction of the struggle, and only make friends suffer and enemies rejoice, causing great harm to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

This way of doing things seriously hinders the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity. They are always led by the nose by the interests of their own faction. They only care about a small hill in front of them, while ignoring the major affairs of the entire country. Once there is a conflict between their faction and other organizations, they do not distinguish right from wrong and immediately launch an attack, arguing endlessly. They are easily used by a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and other bad elements, causing endless "civil wars," and even serious armed clashes. Clearly, both sides are revolutionary factions, have common battle goals, and are willing to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. Just because of some disagreements on certain issues, they cannot sit together. Both sides, for the interests of their own factions, exaggerate the shortcomings and errors of the other side.

This way of doing things is not conducive to the thorough liberation of revolutionary cadres and the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Treating cadre issues from a factional perspective can only confuse the class line of cadres, giving a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road the opportunity to muddy the waters and fish in troubled waters, while for the broad revolutionary cadres, it is a spiritual constraint. If genuine revolutionary cadres are not liberated, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" will remain an empty phrase. In some units, various factions, due to their factional attitudes towards cadre issues, have created unprincipled disputes and unresolved contradictions, often becoming the spark for armed clashes.

We, the proletarian revolutionary forces, are fighting for the overall interests of the proletarian revolution and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Party spirit is the concentrated expression of class nature. In our revolutionary ranks, regardless of this group or that organization, we must regard the class interests of the proletariat as the highest interests. In any situation, when the interests of a group or a faction conflict with the overall interests of the proletarian revolution, we must unconditionally submit to the overall interests of the proletarian revolution, and never allow the opposite. The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought concentrates the highest interests of the proletariat and is the highest criterion for all our words and deeds. Therefore, anyone who places the interests of a certain faction above the class interests of the proletariat is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and violates the principles of proletarian party spirit.

Even if the other side is a genuine conservative faction, we must act according to the principles of proletarian party spirit. We must use Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to educate, win over, and unite the vast majority of the masses within it, so that they join the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces. This should be a serious ideological and political task, not unprincipled factional struggles.

So-called sectarianism, in essence, is an enlarged form of individualism, a product of the petty-bourgeois ideological kingdom. Sectarianism prevailing over party spirit is a serious corruption of our revolutionary ranks by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies. Some comrades in our ranks, due to the remnants of individualism in their minds, are easily infected by sectarianism. When suffering from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, the contradiction between factional interests and the revolutionary interests of the proletariat has not yet sharply revealed itself, and this problem has not yet fully attracted people's attention. However, when the struggle has achieved some victories, especially after taking power, the positions have changed, and the contradiction between some comrades' "self-first" thoughts and the overall revolutionary interests of the proletariat becomes prominent. If we do not pay attention to overcoming sectarianism and strengthening party spirit, but instead engage in sectarian activities, we will inevitably put the fundamental interests of the party and the proletariat aside. If this continues, it will lead to a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat." For the sectarianism in our ranks, we must also follow Chairman Mao's wise directive and seriously guide it to the track of proletarian party spirit. "Because this sectarianism is still serious in some comrades, it is still hindering the implementation of the party's line, so we must conduct extensive education within the party on this issue." All proletarian revolutionary fighters must tirelessly fight against various sectarian wrong tendencies and must put them into practice.

Opposing sectarianism prevailing over party spirit is an important part of building the proletarian revolutionary forces with Mao Zedong Thought. Here, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must take the lead. If some leaders have serious sectarian thoughts, they will inevitably lead the ranks down the wrong path of petty-bourgeois sectarianism. If this anti-proletarian sectarian trend continues for a long time, the result will inevitably harm comrades and harm themselves. Therefore, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must take the lead in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, so that the led ranks can always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and unconditionally implement every command and policy of the proletarian headquarters, becoming stronger in battle; so that they can achieve new merits and build new achievements in the great struggle of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

### 无产阶级的党性与小资产阶级的派性

　　无产阶级的党性与小资产阶级的派性
　　上海《文汇报》八月三十一日社论
    目前，在有些革命群众组织的队伍中，出现了一种派性高于党性的错误倾向，必须立即加以制止。
    派性高于党性，就是以本团体、本派别的利害为处理问题的“最高准则”，忘记了无产阶级的整个革命利益，忘记了革命的全局，心目中只有自己的组织，自己的派别，随时随地闹宗派主义，因而作出种种错误的行为来。
    对待无产阶级司令部的指示，他们采取实用主义的态度。凡是符合他们需要的就听，就办；不符合他们需要的就不听，不办。甚至采用斩头去尾，断章取义等手法，借用无产阶级司令部指示中的某一句话，为自己一派的利益服务。
    对待广大革命群众和革命干部，他们采取无原则的态度。凡是同意他们观点的，都是“同志”，都是“革命干部”；凡是不同意他们观点的，都是“仇人”，都是“四类干部”。谁今天同意他们的观点，就亲如手足；明天不同意他们的观点，就遭到残酷斗争。
    对待自己，他们总认为“老子天下第一”，“唯我独左”，“唯我独革”。只知道组织本派力量，去“轰”别的组织，而从来没有作过一次象样的自我批评。
    在我们无产阶级革命派的队伍中，如果任凭这种宗派主义思潮泛滥，就会混淆是非，使严肃的政治斗争，变成为无原则的派别纠纷，转移斗争大方向，只能使亲者痛、仇者快，对无产阶级文化大革命造成莫大的损失。
    这样做，严重地阻碍着革命大批判的深入展开，阻碍着革命大联合的巩固和发展。他们整天被本派别的利害牵着鼻子跑。关心的，只是鼻尖下的一个小山头，而对整个国家的大事则不闻不问。一旦本派别与别的组织闹了点矛盾，不分是非曲直，就要兴师问罪，争吵个不休，并且容易受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和其他坏人的利用，造成打不停的“内战”，甚至出现严重的武斗事件。明明双方都是革命派，都有共同的战斗目标，都愿意彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，仅仅因为某些问题上出现了分歧，就坐不到一块儿来。双方都为了本派别的利益，把对方的缺点、错误无限上纲。
    这样做，不利于革命干部的彻底解放，不可能实现革命的“三结合”。从派别斗争来对待干部问题，只能搞乱干部的阶级阵线，给党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派混水摸鱼大开方便之门，而对广大革命干部，则是一种精神束缚。真正的革命干部得不到解放，革命的“三结合”也就成了一句空话。在有的单位中，各派由于在干部问题上采取了宗派主义态度，造成了无原则的纠纷，搞不清的矛盾，往往变为武斗的导火线。
    我们无产阶级革命派，是为了整个无产阶级的革命利益，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗的。党性，就是阶级性的集中表现。在我们革命队伍中，不管这个团体，那个组织，都必须把无产阶级的阶级利益看作是最高利益。在任何情况下，当一个团体、一个派别的利益与整个无产阶级的革命利益发生矛盾时，就要毫无条件地服从整个无产阶级的革命利益，而决不允许相反。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，集中地代表了无产阶级的最高利益，是我们一切言行的最高准则。因此，任何把某一派别的利益放在无产阶级的阶级利益之上，都是不符合毛泽东思想的，都是违反了无产阶级的党性原则的。
    即使对方是真正的保守派组织，我们也要根据无产阶级的党性原则办事。必须用毛主席的革命路线去教育、争取、团结其中绝大多数的群众，使他们站到无产阶级革命派的队伍中来。这应该是一项严肃的思想政治工作，而决不是搞无原则的派别斗争。
    所谓派性，说穿了，是扩大了的个人主义，是属于小资产阶级思想王国里的货色。派性高于党性，这是资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮对我们革命队伍的严重腐蚀。我们队伍中有些同志，由于头脑中残存着个人主义，就往往容易受宗派主义所侵袭。在遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害时，由于派别的利益与无产阶级的革命利益之间的矛盾还没有尖锐地暴露出来，这个问题还没有充分引起人们的注意。但是，当斗争取得了一定的胜利，特别在掌权以后，地位起了变化，有些同志的个人第一的思想，与无产阶级整个革命利益的矛盾就显著地暴露出来。如果不注意克服派性，增强党性，反而大搞宗派主义活动，就必然会把党和无产阶级的根本利益置之脑后，照此发展下去，就会背叛无产阶级革命事业。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”对于我们队伍中出现的派性，也要遵循毛主席的这一英明指示，认真地将它引导到无产阶级党性的轨道上来。“因为这种宗派主义在一部分同志中还很严重，还在障碍党的路线的实行，所以我们要针对这个问题在党内进行广大的教育。”一切无产阶级革命派战士都要同形形色色的宗派主义的错误倾向作不疲倦的斗争，并且必须见之于实践。
    反对派性高于党性，这是用毛泽东思想建设无产阶级革命派队伍的重要内容。在这里，革命群众组织的负责人必须起带头作用。如果有些头头存在着严重的宗派主义思想，势必会把队伍带上小资产阶级派性的歪路上去。这种反无产阶级的派性思潮，如果长时期地闹下去，结果必然是害了同志，也害了自己。因此，革命群众组织的负责人，只有带头破私立公，才能使带领的队伍始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，不折不扣地执行无产阶级司令部的每一项命令和方针政策，越战越坚强；才能在当前无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战斗中立新功、建新劳。　　（新华社四日讯）
