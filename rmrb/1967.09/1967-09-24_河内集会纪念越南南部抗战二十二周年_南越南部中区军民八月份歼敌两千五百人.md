Hanoi Holds Rally to Mark 22nd Anniversary of Resistance in South Vietnam
South Vietnamese Mid-South Region Military and Civilians Kill 2,500 Enemy Troops in August

	HANOI, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) — According to reports from local newspapers, various sectors of Hanoi held a rally on the evening of the 22nd to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the resistance against French colonialists and American interventionists in South Vietnam (September 23). Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front National Committee, Nguyen Huu Tho, and other leaders attended the rally.

	Spring Water, a member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee, and Nguyen Van Tien, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in North Vietnam, both spoke at the rally. They expressed that the people of North and South Vietnam are determined to carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to resist America and save the country, to carry forward the heroic traditions of the nation, to strengthen unity, and to defeat the American aggressors, to complete the glorious cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and achieving the peaceful reunification of the country.

	HANOI, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) — According to reports from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of various provinces in the Mid-South region of South Vietnam achieved outstanding results in August, eliminating more than 2,500 enemy troops after a month of fierce fighting. Among the enemy casualties were over 900 American invaders, including the complete annihilation of two American companies, one platoon, six puppet companies, seven platoons, and one command post of a puppet regiment.

	During this period, the military and civilians of the Mid-South region also shot down 10 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 13 military vehicles, sunk or damaged eight warships, blew up two bridges, and forced the enemy to withdraw from 23 outposts, sentry posts, and one puppet county government office.

	In this month, the military and civilians of the Mid-South region continued to vigorously carry out guerrilla warfare, with tens of thousands of people cooperating with the liberation armed forces to cut off almost all major roads within the region and repeatedly attack the enemy on the My Tho River and other waterways.

	At the same time, the military and civilians of the Mid-South region also infiltrated enemy-occupied areas, attacking enemy forces in various towns and their surrounding areas, making the enemy tremble with fear.

	BEIJING, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) — SAIGON — The liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region of South Vietnam, which have repeatedly defeated the American invaders south of the demilitarized zone in recent months, have recently launched fierce attacks on American military bases such as Kon Tum and Yon Ling with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and chaos among the enemy. By the 21st, the liberation armed forces' artillery bombardment had continued for three days. According to reports from Western news agencies, despite the use of B-52 bombers for bombing and artillery counterattacks by the United States, they could not withstand the fierce offensive of the liberation armed forces. The firepower of the liberation armed forces is "extremely powerful," and the American invaders hurriedly transferred aircraft and other facilities from the nearby Dong Ha base, fearing they would be bombed.

	The U.S.-puppet forces are increasingly terrified of the situation in North Vietnam. In a report on the 19th, the United Press International lamented that the northern battlefield "has never been as depressing as it is now." Some local U.S.-puppet commanders are filled with pessimistic and despairing sentiments about the battlefield situation. A puppet officer said: "If we don't fight, we will fail; if we fight, we will also fail."

　　南越南部中区军民八月份歼敌两千五百人
    新华社河内二十三日电　据这里报纸二十三日报道：河内各界人民代表二十二日晚举行集会，纪念越南南部人民抗击法国殖民者和美国干涉者抗战日（九月二十三日）二十二周年。越南祖国战线全国委员会主席团主席孙德胜等出席了集会。
    越南劳动党中央委员、越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员春水和越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进分别在集会上讲话。他们都表示，越南南北两方同胞，坚决实现胡主席抗美救国伟大号召，发扬民族的英雄传统，加强团结，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，完成解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国的光荣事业。
    新华社河内二十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方南部中区各省军民，在八月份里经过一个月的英勇奋战，取得了歼敌二千五百多名的出色战绩。在被歼敌军中，包括美国侵略军九百多名，其中全歼美军两个连、一个排，伪军六个连、七个排和一个营指挥所。
    在这期间，南部中区军民还击落敌机十架，击毁击伤军车十三辆，击沉击伤战船八艘，炸毁桥梁两座，摧毁和迫使敌人撤出二十三个据点、哨所和一个伪县政权办事处。
    南部中区军民在这个月里继续大力开展交通战，数以万计的群众，配合解放武装力量，切断了境内几乎所有的重要公路，并且在西万古河等河道上接连打击敌人。
    与此同时，南部中区军民还深入敌占区，袭击各个城镇及其外围地区的敌人，使敌人胆战心惊。
    新华社二十一日讯西贡消息：几个月来接连在非军事区以南把美国侵略军打得狼狈不堪的越南南方广治—承天地区解放武装力量，最近几天又用猛烈的炮火，向美军昆天、犹灵等军事基地频频发动进攻，使敌人伤亡累累，穷于应付。到二十一日为止，解放武装力量的炮轰已连续进行了三天。据西方通讯社的消息透露，尽管美国使用了B—52型飞机进行轰炸和用大炮还击，但都抵挡不住解放武装力量的凌厉攻势。解放武装力量的炮火威力“非常强大”，美国侵略者吓得赶紧把附近的东河基地上的飞机和其它设施慌忙转移，害怕挨炸。
    美伪集团对南越北部的战局越来越感到惊恐不安。合众国际社在十九日的一篇报道中，哀叹北部战场“从来没有象现在这样令人沮丧”。当地一些美伪指挥官，对战场前景充满悲观失望情绪。一个伪军官说：“如果我们不打仗，我们会失败；如果我们打仗，也得失败。”
