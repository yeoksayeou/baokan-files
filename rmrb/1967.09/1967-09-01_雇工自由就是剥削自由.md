The highest-ranking capitalist-road element within the Party vigorously advocates for "hiring laborers and individual farming, which should be left to their own devices," while "those who do not allow hiring laborers and individual farming cannot be left to their own devices." This is completely standing on the side of landlords and rich peasants, speaking for landlords and rich peasants, attempting to develop capitalism in the countryside, and making the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants continue to be exploited.

After the land reform, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize together" and enthusiastically organized mutual aid teams to take the path of collectivization. However, the landlords and rich peasants cheered for the hiring of laborers and individual farming advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Some landlords and rich peasants went out to engage in speculation. Some well-off middle peasants took the lead, gathering the labor-strong, land-good, livestock-good, and tool-good well-off middle peasants and middle peasants in the village, hanging up a sign that read "mutual aid team" but actually practiced individual farming under the name of "good man team." Others also paired up accordingly. The remaining poor and lower-middle peasants with weak labor, few draft animals and tools, and lacking food and clothing were left out. This caused Dazhai's agricultural production to suffer losses, leading to polarization, and some beneficiaries began to borrow money at high interest rates and sell land.

The matter is clear: the essence of the freedom to hire laborers and individual farming is the freedom to exploit, the freedom to develop capitalism; it is the freedom for landlords and rich peasants to continue exploiting the poor and lower-middle peasants, not the freedom for the poor and lower-middle peasants to be free from exploitation; it is the freedom for landlords and rich peasants to get rich individually, not the freedom for the poor and lower-middle peasants to prosper together; it is the freedom for landlords and rich peasants to develop capitalism, not the freedom for the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist path. Look, how poisonous the heart of the highest-ranking capitalist-road element within the Party is! How great their crimes are!

However, the ant trying to shake a tree and the mantis trying to stop a chariot are both futile. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We firmly believe that "only socialism can save China." Under the leadership of Comrade Chen Yonggui, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, insisted on the socialist direction, and stopped the evil wind of hiring laborers and individual farming. The mutual aid team we established—“the old and young team”—had a grain yield per mu that far exceeded the "good man team." The masses of Dazhai saw with their own eyes the power of organization and tasted the sweetness of collectivization. The "old and young team" continued to expand, and the superiority of organization became more evident. The determination to take the socialist path became firmer. In 1953, Dazhai established a primary agricultural producers' cooperative. We won! The dream of the highest-ranking capitalist-road element within the Party to develop capitalism was shattered!

From our own experiences, we deeply understand that the path of collectivization is the happy road to socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai must more resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, steadfastly take the path of collectivization, and walk all the way to communism.

　　雇工自由就是剥削自由
　　贾来恒
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派极力提倡“雇工、单干，应该放任自流”，而“对于不让雇工不让单干的不能放任”，这完全是站在地主、富农的立场上，为地主、富农说话，妄图在农村发展资本主义，让广大贫下中农继续当牛做马。
    土地改革以后，我们大寨的贫下中农，响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，纷纷组织互助组，走集体化的道路。可是地主、富农对中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的雇工、单干自由拍手叫好。一些地主、富农，外出搞投机倒把。一些富裕中农也先发制人，把村子里劳力好、土地好、牲畜好、农具好的富裕中农和中农搞在一起，挂起了名为互助组、实际搞单干的“好汉组”的招牌。其他一些人也都兵对兵、将对将地搭伙起来了。剩下一些劳力弱、耕畜农具少、缺吃少穿的贫下中农，就谁也不要了。这样，使大寨的农业生产受到了损失，出现了两极分化，有些翻身户开始借高利贷、出卖土地了。
    事情很清楚了，雇工、单干自由的实质，就是剥削自由，就是发展资本主义的自由；就是只有地主、富农继续剥削贫下中农的自由，没有贫下中农不受剥削的自由；只有地主、富农个人发财致富的自由，没有贫下中农共同富裕的自由；只有地主、富农发展资本主义的自由，没有贫下中农走社会主义道路的自由。看，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的心有多毒！罪有多大！
    但是，蚍蜉撼树，螳螂挡车，都是痴心妄想。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，我们坚信：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”我们大寨的贫下中农在陈永贵同志的带领下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，坚持社会主义方向，煞住了雇工、单干自由的妖风。我们成立的互助组——“老少组”，粮食亩产大大超过了“好汉组”。大寨的群众亲眼看到了组织起来的力量，尝到了集体化的甜头，“老少组”不断扩大，组织起来的优越性更加明显，走社会主义道路的决心更加坚定。一九五三年，大寨成立了初级农业生产合作社。我们胜利了！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派企图发展资本主义的美梦破灭了！
    我们从自己的亲身经历中，深刻地认识到，集体化道路是社会主义的幸福大道，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子。我们大寨的贫下中农一定要更坚决地遵照毛主席的教导，坚定不移地走集体化的道路，一直走到共产主义。
