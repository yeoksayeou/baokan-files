The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has openly expressed its intention to further provide military aid to the Indonesian reactionaries as a reward, at a time when the fascist military regime in Indonesia is intensifying its frenzied anti-China campaign.

According to reports from Western news agencies, two weeks ago, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique held talks in Moscow with a military delegation from the Indonesian fascist military regime led by Navy Commander Murjadi. On September 9, the foreign minister of this fascist military regime, Malik, said that the negotiations between the Indonesian military delegation and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique on strengthening military collusion between the two sides were "going very smoothly."

According to the Associated Press, the Soviet revisionist clique has agreed to provide Indonesia with "necessary spare parts for the operation of Soviet-made military aircraft and warships."

It is revealed that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has already provided Indonesia with 115 jet military aircraft and 29 warships. Recently, due to a lack of spare parts, only a few aircraft can take to the skies, and only a few warships can leave the port. These weapons were provided under a long-term loan totaling approximately $800 million.

    苏修加紧供应印尼反动派杀人武器
    新华社十七日讯　莫斯科消息：在印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权正在加紧疯狂反华的时候，苏修领导集团公然表示要进一步向印尼反动派提供军事援助，做为犒赏。
    据西方通讯社报道，两个星期以前，苏修领导集团同印尼法西斯军人政权派遣的以海军司令穆尔雅迪为首的军事代表团在莫斯科举行会谈。九日，这个法西斯军人政权的外交部长马利克说，印尼军事代表团同苏修领导集团关于加强双方军事勾结的谈判“进行得很顺利”。
    据美联社报道，苏修集团答应向印尼提供“苏制军用飞机和军舰重新运转所必需的零件”。
    消息透露，苏修领导集团“已经给印尼一百一十五架喷气式军用飞机和二十九艘军舰。最近，因为缺少零件，没有几架飞机能飞上天，没有几艘军舰能离开港口”。这些武器是根据总数约为八亿美元的长期贷款提供的。
