The Japanese reactionary government's Prime Minister, Sato Eisaku, acting on the instructions of American imperialism, sneaked into our territory of Taiwan from September 7 to 9 to hold "talks" with the bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek, whom the Chinese people despise, and plot anti-Chinese conspiracies. At the same time, the Sato reactionary government dispatched armed police and plainclothes agents in Tokyo to beat up our staff members and create anti-China incidents. The Chinese people must resolutely strike back at the Sato reactionary government's various insane and hostile acts against China!

As soon as Sato arrived in Taiwan, he loudly proclaimed that he wanted to make the "understanding and friendship" between Japan and the Chiang bandits "closer," and strengthen the so-called "friendly relations." He shamelessly slandered China as a "threat to peace" and declared that he would continue to support the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek in the United Nations. Sato also proposed that the Chiang bandit military leaders visit Japan. It is clear that Sato went to Taiwan to conspire with the Chiang bandits in political, economic, and military matters, to strengthen the "Northeast Asian military alliance" aimed at China, and to act as the vanguard of the anti-China policies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Since the Sato government came to power, it has consistently followed the lead of U.S. imperialism, colluded with Soviet revisionism, and conspired to form anti-China political and military alliances. It has even drafted a series of military attack plans with China as the hypothetical enemy and is vigorously pursuing an anti-China policy. Now, at a time when U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries are launching a new wave of anti-China hysteria, Sato is getting cozy with the Chiang bandits, doing things that previous reactionary governments of Japan, such as Yoshida Shigeru and Kishi Nobusuke, have not done. This fully exposes the reactionary and aggressive nature of the Sato government.

One of the evil purposes of the Sato government's intensified collusion with the Chiang bandits is to extend its aggressive hands into our territory of Taiwan. Soon after the Sato government came to power, it arrogantly declared that "the status of Taiwan is undetermined." Japanese monopolies have even more blatantly proposed the "New Taiwan Expedition Theory," claiming that Taiwan is Japan's "breakwater" and that it cannot "abandon" Taiwan and cannot "separate the status of Taiwan from Japan," and so on. In recent years, Japanese monopoly capital has accelerated its infiltration into Taiwan, large numbers of Japanese military officers have gone to Taiwan for "inspection," and the Japanese fleet has even brazenly intruded into Taiwan, provocatively challenging the Chinese people. Sato's formal "visit" to the Chiang bandits this time has further exposed the wolfish ambition of Japanese militarism to reoccupy our territory of Taiwan.

Sato's activities in Taiwan this time are part of the anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary grand conspiracy that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are feverishly plotting in Asia. After the summit between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the leaders of the Sato reactionary government have been busy running around, from Seoul to Moscow, conducting frequent activities. After visiting Taiwan, Sato will also visit ten countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region, and finally go to the United States to pay homage to his master, Johnson. Sato's visit to Taiwan is obviously to serve U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in forging an anti-China encirclement.

Sato's activities in Taiwan and Southeast Asia are also a major step in the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital abroad. Japanese militarism, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, has already risen from the ashes. It believes that its feathers are now full and is impatiently trying to realize its plan to enslave the peoples of Southeast Asia and relive the dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

To cover up his reactionary face and aggressive ambitions, Sato, before going to Taiwan, pretended to say that the Japanese government is "not strengthening the anti-communist line" but is "adopting a line of coexistence." What nonsense! Sato's so-called "coexistence" is not the same as Tojo Hideki's "coexistence and prosperity"? The difference is that Tojo implemented Japan's imperialist policy of aggression, while the current Sato reactionary government, relying on the power of U.S. imperialism, is carrying out aggression and expansion, acting as a vicious aggressor for U.S. imperialism in Asia.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The slaves who are firmly led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will ultimately perish for U.S. imperialism."

The Sato reactionary government has tightly bound Japan to the war chariot of the United States, firmly following the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism. This is something that the Japanese people absolutely cannot allow. The Japanese people strongly demand friendship with China. They are resolutely fighting against the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism in creating "two Chinas" and fiercely opposing the Chinese people.

Regarding Sato's personal involvement in colluding with the Chiang bandits this time, people from various strata in Japan, including those with insight within the Liberal Democratic Party, have expressed dissatisfaction and opposition. Only the revisionist group led by Komoto, who claims to be a Marxist-Leninist, has not opposed it to this day, once again exposing their traitorous face.

The Japanese nation is a great nation. The Japanese people have a tradition of resisting foreign aggression. They will surely rise up to oppose the Sato reactionary government and smash the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Japan.

The Sato reactionary government's return to the old path of Japanese militarism's aggression will inevitably arouse the new and old grudges of the peoples of Asia. The peoples of Asia will surely rise up to attack it.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. The Chinese people will definitely liberate their territory of Taiwan. Anyone who attempts to create "two Chinas" and separate Taiwan from China's territory will surely meet with utter failure.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible in the world. The Sato government's insane hostile actions against China and aggression in Asia will not end well and will only meet the same fate as its predecessor, Tojo Hideki, being thoroughly buried by the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the peoples of Asia!

### 佐藤政府正在走东条的老路

　　佐藤政府正在走东条的老路
    日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作，秉承美帝国主义的意旨，在九月七日至九日钻进我国领土台湾，同中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石匪帮举行
  “会谈”，策划反对中国人民的阴谋活动。与此同时，佐藤反动政府又在东京出动武装警察和便衣特务，殴打我方工作人员，制造反华事件。对于佐藤反动政府的这种种疯狂敌视中国的罪行，中国人民一定要给予坚决的回击！
    佐藤一到台湾就大肆叫嚣，要使日本同蒋匪帮的“谅解和友谊”“更为密切”，加强所谓“亲善关系”。他放肆地诽谤中国是对“和平的威胁”，并且宣称，要在联合国继续支持蒋介石这具政治僵尸。佐藤还提出要蒋匪军事头目访问日本。事情很明显，佐藤到台湾，是为了同蒋匪帮在政治、经济、军事上加紧全面勾结，强化矛头针对中国的“东北亚军事同盟”，充当美帝苏修反华的急先锋。
    佐藤政府上台以来，一贯追随美帝，勾结苏修，拼凑反华的政治军事同盟，甚至拟订了一系列以中国为假想敌的军事进攻蓝图，并且大搞“两个中国”的阴谋，狂热地推行反华政策。现在，正当美帝、苏修和各国反动派掀起一股新的反华浪潮的时候，佐藤同蒋匪帮打得火热，干了过去吉田茂、岸信介等历届日本反动政府所没有干的坏事。这就彻底暴露出佐藤政府的反动性和侵略性。
    佐藤政府加紧同蒋匪帮进行全面勾结的一个罪恶目的，是要把它的侵略黑手伸进我国领土台湾。佐藤政府上台伊始，就曾狂妄地叫嚣什么“台湾归属未定”。日本财阀更赤裸裸地提出“新征台论”，叫嚷台湾是日本的“防波堤”，决不能“放弃”台湾，“不能把台湾的地位和日本分开”等等。近年来，日本垄断资本加速侵入台湾，日本大批军官到台湾进行“考察”，日本舰队也公然闯入台湾，向中国人民猖狂挑衅。佐藤这次正式“访问”蒋匪帮，更加暴露了日本军国主义势力妄图重新霸占我国领土台湾的狼子野心。
    佐藤这次到台湾活动，是美帝苏修正在亚洲紧张策划的反华、反共、反人民、反革命大阴谋的一个组成部分。在美帝苏修头目葛拉斯堡罗会谈之后，佐藤反动政府的头目们东奔西跑，南窜北跳，从汉城到莫斯科，进行了频繁的活动。佐藤到台湾之后，还要访问亚洲太平洋地区的十个国家和地区；最后到美国，朝拜他的主子约翰逊。佐藤这次到台湾去，显然是为美帝、苏修拼凑反华包围圈奔走效劳。
    佐藤到台湾和东南亚地区进行活动，也是日本垄断资本向外扩张的一个重大步骤。日本军国主义在美帝的扶植下，已经死灰复燃。它自以为羽毛已丰，迫不及待地妄图实现它奴役东南亚各国人民的侵略计划，重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。
    佐藤为了掩盖自己的反动面目和侵略野心，在去台湾之前装模作样地说什么日本政府“不是要加强反共路线”，而是“采取共处路线”。真是见它的鬼！佐藤的所谓“共处”，不就是东条英机的“共存共荣”的同义语吗？不同的是，当年东条实行的是日本帝国主义自己的侵略政策，而现在的佐藤反动政府则是仗美帝之势，进行侵略和扩张，充当美帝在亚洲的一名凶恶的侵略爪牙。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬”。
    佐藤反动政府把日本紧紧地绑在美国的战车上，死心塌地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，这是日本人民所绝对不能允许的。日本人民强烈要求同中国友好，他们对美帝国主义和日本军国主义制造“两个中国”、疯狂敌视中国人民的滔天罪行，进行着坚决的斗争。
    对佐藤这次亲自出马同蒋匪帮进行勾结，日本各阶层包括自由民主党内的有识之士，都纷纷表示不满和反对，唯独自称为马列主义者的宫本修正主义集团至今毫不加以反对，这又一次暴露了他们的叛徒嘴脸。
    日本民族是一个伟大的民族。日本人民是具有反对外来侵略传统的人民。他们一定会起来大造佐藤反动政府的反，打碎美帝国主义及其走狗在日本的反动统治。
    佐藤反动政府重走日本军国主义的侵略老路，必然要激起亚洲各国人民的新仇旧恨，亚洲人民必然要群起而攻之。
    台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾。任何人企图制造“两个中国”，把台湾从中国的领土分割出去的罪恶阴谋，一定要遭到彻底的失败。
    正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是天下无敌的。佐藤政府这样丧心病狂地对中国采取敌对行动，侵略亚洲，决不会有什么好结果，而只能象它的前辈东条英机一样，被中国人民、日本人民和亚洲人民彻底埋葬！
