At a crucial juncture in the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On Tao Zhu's Two Books" has been published. This is a brilliant article that shines with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, a significant article that thoroughly smashes the bourgeois headquarters with a heavy artillery shell from the political, ideological, and theoretical fronts. It is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The article expresses the feelings of the hearts of the proletarian revolutionary masses. We heartily cheer: Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article is excellent! It is excellent indeed! It has extremely important guiding significance for us to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, promote ideological revolutionization, and unite as one to fight the enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be particularly vigilant against individuals like Khrushchev who have personal ambitions and engage in conspiracies, and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at various levels." Tao Zhu, this "Southern Tyrant," is such a person. He has long worn the disguise of an "old revolutionary" while engaging in counter-revolutionary crimes of restoring capitalism, using cunning counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, being a person in front and a ghost behind, spreading the reactionary ideas of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything," and madly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the ultra-right and ultra-"left," sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat, and aiming to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. Although Tao Zhu, this two-faced person, is very cunning, he cannot escape the eyes of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary people have torn off his disguise and exposed his ugly face under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. The publication of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article is the pronouncement of his death sentence.

Chairman Mao says: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." At present, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society, inheriting the legacy of the counter-revolutionary two-faced person Tao Zhu, have once again raised the reactionary banner of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything" from the ultra-"left" to disrupt the direction of the revolutionary struggle. They direct the spearhead of the struggle at the proletarian headquarters and the great People's Liberation Army. These elements' evil purpose is to attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotage the great pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the People's Liberation Army, and attempt to shake the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao. We must not allow their plots to succeed. We proletarian revolutionaries deeply understand that directing the spearhead of the struggle at whom is a major principle of right and wrong, a major principle of standing on the side of the proletarian headquarters or the bourgeois headquarters. On this question, we must not be ambiguous. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, raise our revolutionary vigilance, resolutely resist the anarchist trend of thought, and defend to the death Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters and the dictatorship of the proletariat, ensuring the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment? Can we resolutely execute the orders of the proletarian headquarters? This is a major question of whether we adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and whether we carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end or stop halfway. We proletarian revolutionaries listen to Chairman Mao the most and follow the orders of the proletarian headquarters the most. We must seriously study and deeply understand the spirit of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article and immediately put it into action. We must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and be models of revolutionary criticism. In the struggle, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, with the greatest effort to thoroughly criticize and expose politically, ideologically, and theoretically the Chinese Khrushchev. At the same time, we must firmly grasp our own ideological revolutionization, thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters in our minds, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings, guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution, and at all times prevent the infiltration of various non-proletarian ideologies. We must carry out the revolutionary great criticism more deeply and solidly, promote revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, seize revolution and promote production, further economize for the revolution, always believe in the army, firmly rely on the army, and always be models of supporting the army.

　　斗争矛头指向谁是个大是大非问题
　　上海工人革命造反总司令部
    在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的重要关头，姚文元同志的重要文章《评陶铸的两本书》发表了。这是一篇闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的具有重大意义的文章，是从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的一颗重型炮弹，是毛主席伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分。这篇文章说出了我们无产阶级革命派的心里话。我们最热烈地欢呼：姚文元同志的文章好得很！好极了！它对于我们紧紧掌握斗争大方向、促进思想革命化，团结一致对敌，有着极其重大的指导意义。
    毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”陶铸，这个“南霸天”，就是这样的人物。他长期披着“老革命”的画皮，干着复辟资本主义的反革命罪恶勾当，大耍反革命两面派的阴谋手段，当面是人，背后是鬼，散布“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的反动思想，从极右和极“左”的方面疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政，以达到其复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。尽管陶铸这个两面派十分狡猾，但他终于逃脱不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民的眼睛，革命人民撕下了他的画皮，把他的丑恶面目暴露在毛泽东思想的阳光之下。姚文元同志这篇重要文章的发表，正是宣判了他的死刑。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，他们继承反革命两面派陶铸的衣钵，又打起“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的反动旗号，从极“左”的方面来扰乱革命斗争的大方向。他们把斗争的矛头对准无产阶级司令部，对准伟大的中国人民解放军。这些家伙的罪恶目的，是妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政的强大支柱——中国人民解放军，妄图动摇以伟大领袖毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。我们无产阶级革命派深深懂得，把斗争矛头指向谁，这是个大是大非的问题，是站在无产阶级司令部一边，还是站在资产阶级司令部一边的重大原则问题。对这个问题我们决不能含糊。我们一定要高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，提高革命警惕性，坚决抵制无政府主义思潮，誓死捍卫毛主席无产阶级司令部，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政，保证无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    能不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，能不能坚决执行无产阶级司令部的号令，这是关系到是坚持毛主席的革命路线，还是背离毛主席的革命路线的大问题，是关系到将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，还是半途而废的大问题。我们无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，最听无产阶级司令部的号令。我们一定要认真学习和深刻领会姚文元同志这篇重要文章的精神，并立即见之行动。我们一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，做革命大批判的模范。在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以最大的努力把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭。同时要狠抓自己的思想革命化，彻底砸烂我们头脑中的资产阶级司令部，按照毛主席的教导，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，时刻防止形形色色的非无产阶级思想的侵蚀。我们要更深入、更扎实地开展革命的大批判，促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，抓革命，促生产，进一步节约闹革命，永远相信解放军，坚决依靠解放军，永远做拥军的模范。
