The Japanese Kokusakuza Theater Troupe is a revolutionary and combative theater troupe. Since the troupe arrived in China, these Japanese revolutionary cultural soldiers have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, linking them to practical actions and fully demonstrating the Japanese revolutionary people's boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their deep affection for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The Most Precious Gift

On August 25, Premier Zhou and Comrade Kang Sheng watched the Kokusakuza Theater Troupe's performance of "Wildfire." After the performance, when they went on stage to congratulate, Premier Zhou gave his red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the troupe leader Fujikawa Natsuko. The troupe leader, with tears in her eyes, accepted this most precious gift and was so moved that she couldn't speak. She waved the precious book vigorously, trying to let every member of the troupe see it. People looked up at the precious book, and the applause and cheers resonated. The excited hearts could not calm down for a long time. Later, the troupe leader said, "There is no more precious gift than this. This is a great honor and an inexhaustible spiritual nourishment for our entire troupe and the Japanese revolutionary people. In the past, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought to rebel and carry out anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles. In the future, we must study Mao Zedong Thought even better and walk the revolutionary literary path pointed out by Chairman Mao for life, determined to fight to the end with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!"

Seizing Every Moment to Study

The Kokusakuza comrades have an unshakable system for studying Chairman Mao's works. In addition to scheduled discussions and self-study, they seize every opportunity to read Chairman Mao's quotations collectively before meals, before rehearsals and performances, and before other activities start. Whether in the theater, in the hotel, or in the car, one can see them holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reading aloud with great enthusiasm.

Actor Terai Tetsuyuki and Tagami Takeo, who had throat problems, went to the hospital for check-ups and treatment. Every time they went to the hospital, they brought "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied a few sections whenever they had time. Terai even insisted on studying Chairman Mao's quotations while sitting on the treatment table. Because the throat treatment used short-wave therapy, he had to sit in a fixed chair with the short-wave contactor placed near his neck for fifteen minutes. Despite feeling hot all over and sweating profusely after the short-wave treatment, he still held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with both hands, concentrating on reading. The enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works was much higher than the temperature of the physical therapy! The surrounding patients were deeply moved every time they saw this scene and resolved to learn from the Kokusakuza comrades.

Stage Art Must Serve Politics

Stage worker Kirui Koyo, combining his work with the study of Chairman Mao's works, achieved immediate results. In the first act of "Wildfire," the setting is in the silk-reeling workshop of the big landlord and capitalist Kurogane Masakichi. Originally, the stage design did not clearly reflect class relations. The butler and the female workers' workplaces had similar backgrounds, and outside the window, one could see green mountains and clear waters, a rather picturesque scene. After studying Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" multiple times, he felt that such a stage design was art for art's sake and should be boldly "broken." Since stage art must serve politics, it should first reflect class relations. Therefore, he redesigned it, removing the scenery outside the window and hanging a leisurely painting behind the butler. Outside the window facing the silk-reeling women was a slowly turning waterwheel and a gloomy, dark sky. In this way, the relationship between the oppressors and the oppressed was first impressed on the audience through stage art.

Bringing the Struggle Against Imperialism and Revisionism to the Stage

The second play by the Kokusakuza Theater Troupe, "Advancing Against the Storm," is based on the current struggle of the Japanese people under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought against imperialism, Japanese monopolies, and the royalist revisionist group. It depicts the story of the workers of the Iwakuni Automobile Company uniting around the leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party to resolutely fight against American imperialism, Japanese monopolies, and the royalist revisionist group.

After coming to China and experiencing the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, they further studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, making significant revisions to the script. To deeply and vividly reflect the fierce struggle of the Japanese people, Fukushima Kikuya, who was responsible for revising the script, studied Chairman Mao's works over and over again. Especially when encountering difficulties and being unable to write, he would seriously consult Chairman Mao's works. He said, "To bring the real struggle of the Japanese people to the stage, one must first learn Mao Zedong Thought well, because this struggle is being carried out under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." In conjunction with the current situation where revolutionary leftists in Japan are rising up to fiercely criticize the royalist revisionist group and gradually strengthening unity, he repeatedly studied relevant sections of Chairman Mao's works on people's war, armed seizure of power, and party building, especially the section: "A disciplined party armed with Marxism-Leninism, applying the method of self-criticism and maintaining close ties with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and groups led by such a party. These three are our main weapons for defeating the enemy." This section became his guide for creation. Fukushima said, "If we can master and apply these three treasures given by Chairman Mao, we can thoroughly defeat the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Therefore, we must use our play to tell the Japanese people the truth and direction indicated by Chairman Mao. In this way, our literature and art can 'serve as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.'"

Walking the Path Pointed Out by Chairman Mao

This time, Ms. Wen Gongzi of the Kokusakuza Theater Troupe did not take on any role in the play, and her health was not good, but she strictly demanded of herself, worked diligently, and contributed a great deal of labor to the troupe's performance. No matter what task she always took the lead. Every day, when tidying up the rehearsal venue, she was the most enthusiastic. Usually, sweeping the corridors, washing tea cups, and emptying ashtrays, she did the most diligently and seriously, fearing neither dirt nor fatigue. The troupe stayed at the New Overseas Hotel, and she insisted on cleaning her own room. Just a few days after arriving in Beijing, she learned the time when the service staff cleaned the rooms. Before the service staff arrived, she had already tidied and cleaned the room spotlessly. Later, the service staff came early to clean and told her, "This is our job and responsibility." She insisted on not letting the service staff do it, repeatedly saying, "You go clean other rooms, let me practice. Chairman Mao teaches us cultural workers to definitely shift our standpoint, shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This requires us to go deep among the workers and peasants, participate in practical struggles and labor. In Japan, we did this, going to factories and villages to work, experience life, and unite with the workers and peasants. Coming to China, we cannot stop, because this is the path pointed out by Chairman Mao! No matter where I go, I will firmly walk this path."

The comrades of the Kokusakuza Theater Troupe listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, advancing leaps and bounds on the revolutionary literary path pointed out by Chairman Mao. They perform revolutionary plays in the midst of fierce class struggles, forever remain revolutionary people, and set a brilliant example for revolutionary literary workers. They are indeed good soldiers loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line.

    做忠于毛主席革命文艺路线的好战士
    ——记日本齿轮座剧团在北京演出期间活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹		江培柱
    日本齿轮座剧团是一个革命的战斗的剧团。自剧团来中国后，这些日本革命派的文艺战士认真地活学活用毛主席著作，并联系实际，身体力行，充分表现了日本革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的深厚感情。
    最最珍贵的礼物
    八月二十五日，周总理和康生同志观看了齿轮座剧团演出《野火》。剧终上台祝贺时，周总理将自己的红彤彤的《毛主席语录》送给了团长藤川夏子同志。团长含着热泪接受这份最珍贵的礼物，感动得说不出一句话来。她用力挥动这本宝书，尽量让团里每一个同志都多看上几眼。人们仰望着宝书，掌声，欢呼声响成一片，激动的心，久久不得平静。事后，团长说：“再也没有比这更宝贵的礼物了。这是给予我们全团和日本革命人民的莫大荣誉和用之不竭的精神食粮。过去，我们就靠毛泽东思想起来造反，开展反帝、反修斗争，今后要更好地学习毛泽东思想，一辈子走毛主席所指出的革命文艺道路，决心和帝修反斗争到底！”
      见缝插针分秒必争
    齿轮座同志有“雷打不动”的毛主席著作学习制度，除了固定安排的讨论和自学外，还抓紧一切时机，每天坚持在饭前，排练、演出前和其他活动开始前都集体选读毛主席语录，用毛主席思想统帅一切活动。无论在剧场、在饭店、在汽车上都可以看到他们手捧《毛主席语录》，高声朗读的情景。
    演员寺尾哲之和俵武生嗓子患病去医院检查、治疗。每次到医院去，他们都带着《毛主席语录》，一有空就抓紧时间学几段。寺尾即使坐在治疗台上也坚持学习毛主席语录。因为治嗓子用的是超短波疗法，要坐在固定的椅子上，把超短波接触器放在颈部附近，烤上十五分钟。尽管通短波之后，全身发热，汗流满面，他还是双手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，聚精会神地读。物理疗法的温度那有他们学习毛主席著作的热情高啊！周围的患者同志每次看到这种情景都莫不为之感动，并且下定决心一定要向齿轮座同志学习。	  舞台美术要为政治服务
    舞台工作人员桐井孝三结合工作认真学习毛主席著作，收到了立竿见影的效果。《野火》第一幕戏地点在大地主兼资本家黑金正吉老板的缫丝车间。原来舞台布景设计体现阶级关系不明显。管家和女工工作地方的背景差不多，窗外还可以看到青山绿水，风光颇为别致。他在多次学习毛主席《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》后，感到这样的舞台设计是为艺术而艺术，应大胆地“破”。舞台美术既然要为政治服务，首先应当体现出阶级关系来。所以，他重新作了设计，撤掉了窗外的景致，在管家身后画上了一幅闲情别逸的挂画。而缫丝女工面对的窗外是慢腾腾转动的水车和一片阴沉、灰暗的天。这样，压迫和被压迫者的阶级关系首先通过舞台美术给观众留下深刻印象。	  把反帝反修斗争搬上舞台
    齿轮座剧团的第二个话剧《迎着暴风雨前进》，是以在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下日本人民当前开展的反帝反修斗争为题材的。它描写岩国汽车公司工人团结在日共左派周围同美帝国主义、日本垄断资本和宫本修正主义集团进行坚决斗争的事迹。
    剧团来中国接触到无产阶级文化大革命的实际以后，他们进一步活学活用毛主席著作，对剧本进行了较大的修改。为了深刻、生动地反映日本人民这一如火如荼的斗争，负责执笔修改剧本的福岛久嘉，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作。特别是碰到难题写不下去时，便认真向毛主席著作请教。他说：“要把日本人民的现实斗争搬上舞台，就必须首先学好毛泽东思想，因为这一斗争是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下进行的。”结合日本目前革命左派纷纷起来大造宫本修正主义集团的反，并且在斗争中逐渐加强团结的大好形势，他反复学习了有关的毛主席关于人民战争、武装夺取政权和建党的学说，特别是“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。”这一段成了他创作的指南。福岛说：“如果我们能掌握和运用好毛主席给我们的这三件法宝，就能彻底打败帝、修、反。所以一定要通过我们的剧把毛主席阐述的真理和指明的方向告诉日本人民。这样，我们的文艺才能“作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”	    走毛主席指出的道路
    齿轮座剧团的文恭子同志这次在剧中没有担任什么角色，身体也不大好，但她处处严格要求自己，兢兢业业，埋头苦干，为剧团的演出付出了大量的劳动。不管有什么活儿她总是抢在前头。每天整理排练场时她都是最积极的。平时扫走廊，洗茶碗，倒烟灰缸等杂事也干得最勤、最认真，不怕脏、不怕累。剧团住在新侨饭店，她一直坚持自己打扫房间。刚来北京不几天她就了解了服务员每天打扫房间的时间。在服务员来之前，她早把房间整理、打扫得干干净净了。后来服务员同志就提早来打扫，并告诉她：“这是我们服务员的工作和应尽的责任”。她无论如何也不肯让服务员同志干，一再地说：“你们去打扫别的房间吧，让我锻炼锻炼。毛主席他老人家教导我们文艺工作者一定要把立足点移过来，移到工农兵这方面来。这就要深入工农，参加实际斗争和劳动。在日本我们这样作了，到工厂、乡村参加劳动，体验生活，和工农相结合，到了中国也不能间断，因为这是毛主席他老人家给我们指出的道路呀！不管到那里我都要坚定不移地走下去。”
    齿轮座剧团的同志这样听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事，沿着毛主席指出的革命文艺大道飞跃前进。他们在激烈的阶级斗争风暴里，大演革命戏，永做革命人，为革命的文艺工作者树立了光辉的典范。他们不愧为忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的好战士。
