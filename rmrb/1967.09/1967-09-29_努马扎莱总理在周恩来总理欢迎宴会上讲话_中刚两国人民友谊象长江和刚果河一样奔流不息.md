Prime Minister Noumazalaye's Speech at the Welcome Banquet Hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai

The Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Congo Flows Like the Yangtze and Congo Rivers

	Xinhua News Agency, September 28th

	Prime Minister Noumazalaye, at the welcome banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai, delivered the following speech:

	Premier, Your Excellencies, Dear Comrades, Dear Friends:

	First of all, I am fulfilling the mission entrusted to me by the National Revolutionary Movement General Secretary Alphonse Massamba-Debat of my country, as well as the Congolese government and the entire Congolese people, to convey their warm and fraternal greetings to you. I extend their warm and fraternal greetings to the great leader of the Chinese people and the great friend of the Congolese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, to Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to Premier Zhou Enlai, to all the Chinese leaders, and to the heroic Chinese people.

	Premier,

	The Chinese Party and government have given me the opportunity to visit your great and beautiful country and to participate in the celebrations of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. I would like to express my gratitude to the Chinese Party and government. This joyful and grateful feeling is shared by all members of our delegation.

	Since our arrival in China, our delegation and I have received extremely warm and sincere welcomes. Your inspiring speech just now is a concrete manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese people and the Congolese (Brazzaville) people. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, our shared ideals and severe tests make our two peoples increasingly close.

	Premier,

	I should have come to visit you earlier as per your kind invitation. It was only due to my busy work schedule that I could not leave the front lines of the struggle, and I apologize for the delay. I believe that my delayed visit will not be misunderstood as a lack of concern for the vibrant and great Chinese people. On the contrary, I have often praised the vibrant and great Chinese people. Since my arrival in China, I have personally felt your friendship and sympathy for us. If anyone doubts our friendship, then your expressions of friendship and sympathy can completely dispel such doubts. Moreover, because our two peoples share the same views and are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder against imperialism led by the United States and to strive for a new order based on socialism, your expressions are very natural. On this path, Congo (Brazzaville) is happy and proud to have China as a steadfast and loyal friend and a completely reliable comrade-in-arms.

	Comrades, Friends,

	We are in an era where the world revolution is at an unprecedented high tide and the dying imperialism is making desperate struggles. Every day, countless facts prove that the revolutionary movement is advancing and the reactionary forces are retreating. Therefore, I am able to come to China at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has entered the decisive stage, and it is truly difficult to conceal my joy.

	We believe that this cultural revolution will make China a socialist country with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science, modern culture, and modern national defense.

	Of course, imperialism is fully aware of the profound revolutionary significance of this movement, and it has launched a large-scale campaign of slander against China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution internationally.

	However, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is no longer just a matter for China alone.

	The anti-propaganda launched by imperialism and its running dogs has, in fact, done the best propaganda for China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The victory of the Cultural Revolution is the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line. I am happy to extend my warm congratulations to the Chinese Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, and to the highly respected leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, for your achievements, especially in the development of production and in the field of science through the hydrogen bomb explosion.

	At a time when the U.S. puppets and their mercenary armies are making desperate struggles and venting their savage and brutal nature on our brave and fraternal Vietnamese people, who have always stood and will always stand by our side, this latest achievement is of great significance because it has shattered nuclear blackmail and encouraged the peoples of various countries who are fighting for national liberation.

	However, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shown, revolution is, and should be, a persistent and ever-developing action. I believe that under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will achieve even greater successes in the cause of socialist construction. Our delegation and I firmly believe that our visit to the fraternal Chinese people will further consolidate and strengthen our friendship.

	I wish the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China to shine brilliantly with the victory and continued development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; I wish the friendship between the peoples of China and Congo to be as everlasting as the flowing Yangtze and Congo Rivers.

	Please allow me to propose a toast:

	To the unbreakable friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville),

	To the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

	To the health of the beloved leader of the Chinese people and the great friend of the Congolese people, Chairman Mao Zedong,

	To the health of the beloved leader of the Congolese people and the great friend of the Chinese people, President Massamba-Debat,

	To the health of our friends present,

	To the victory of the socialist cause,

	Cheers!

　　努马扎莱总理在周恩来总理欢迎宴会上讲话
　　中刚两国人民友谊象长江和刚果河一样奔流不息
    新华社二十八日讯　努马扎莱总理在周恩来总理举行的欢迎宴会上的讲话总理同志，诸位阁下，亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    首先，我要完成我国全国革命运动总书记阿方斯·马桑巴—代巴兄弟以及刚果政府和全体刚果人民赋予我的使命，向你们转达他们的热烈的、兄弟般的敬意，向中国人民的伟大领袖和刚果人民的伟大朋友毛泽东主席，向林彪副主席，向周恩来总理同志，向全体中国领导人和英勇的中国人民转达他们的热烈的、兄弟般的敬意。
      总理同志，
    中国党和政府使我有机会到你们伟大、美丽的国家进行访问，并参加中华人民共和国成立十八周年的庆祝活动，我谨向中国党和政府表示谢意。我这种喜悦、感激的心情，也是我们代表团全体成员所可共有的。
    我们代表团和我本人从到达中国之日起就受到了极其热烈诚挚的欢迎，你刚才又对我国发表了十分鼓舞人心的讲话，这些都具体地体现出中国人民和刚果（布）人民之间牢不可破的友谊。我们两国人民尽管相距万里，但是，共同的理想和严峻的考验使我们两国人民日益感到亲密无间。
      总理同志，
    我本来早就应该应你的盛情邀请前来访问。只是由于工作繁忙不能离开斗争前线因而推迟了访问，我谨借此机会表示歉意。我相信，我推迟访问不会被理解为我不关心朝气蓬勃的伟大的中国人民，恰恰相反，我曾多次赞扬过朝气蓬勃的伟大的中国人民。从我到达中国之日起，我就亲身体会到你们对我们的友谊和同情；如果有人怀疑我们之间的友谊，那么，你们这种友好同情的表示就完全可以解除这样的疑虑。而且由于我们两国人民观点一致，决心为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和争取建立以社会主义为基础的新秩序而坚决并肩战斗，因此你们这种表示是十分自然的。在这条道路上，刚果（布）有中国这样一贯友好和忠诚的朋友和完全可以信赖的战友，感到高兴和自豪。
    同志们、朋友们，
    我们正处在世界革命空前高涨和垂死的帝国主义进行绝望挣扎的时代，每天都有无数的事实证明革命运动在前进，反动力量在退却。因此，我能够在由中国人民爱戴的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自英明地发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段的时候来到中国，的确很难掩盖喜悦的心情。
    我们相信，这场文化革命将使中国成为一个“具有现代农业、现代工业、现代科学、现代文化和现代国防的社会主义国家”。
    当然，帝国主义完全意识到这个运动的深刻的革命意义，它们在国际上掀起了大规模诽谤中国和无产阶级文化革命的浪潮。
    但是，中国的无产阶级文化革命已经不再是中国一国的事了。
    帝国主义及其走狗所发动的反宣传，反而为中国和中国的无产阶级文化大革命作了最好的宣传。文化大革命的胜利就是无产阶级革命路线的胜利。我高兴地向中国党、中国政府和中国人民，向中国人民的深孚众望的领袖毛泽东主席致以热烈的祝贺，祝贺你们获得的成就，特别是在发展生产和通过氢弹爆炸在科学领域内所取得的成就。
    正当美伪和仆从军队进行绝望挣扎，向我们过去和将来始终坚定地站在他们一边的英勇的、兄弟的越南人民肆意发泄野蛮残暴的兽性的时候，这一最新成就是具有极其重大意义的事件，因为这一成就粉碎了核讹诈，并且鼓舞着为争取民族解放而斗争的各国人民。
    但是，正如无产阶级文化革命所证明的那样，革命是，而且应该是坚持不懈的行动，日益发展的行动。我相信，中国人民在毛泽东同志的领导下，必将在社会主义建设事业中取得更大的成就。我们代表团和我本人坚信，我们对兄弟的中国人民的这次访问，必将进一步巩固和加强我们之间的友谊。
    祝中华人民共和国建国十八周年纪念日由于无产阶级文化革命的胜利和继续发展而放射出灿烂的光辉；祝中刚两国人民之间的友谊象奔流不息的长江和刚果河一样万古长青。
    请允许我提议：
    为中华人民共和国和刚果（布）共和国之间牢不可破的友谊，
    为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，
    为中国人民敬爱的领袖、刚果人民的伟大朋友毛泽东主席的健康，
    为刚果人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民的伟大朋友马桑巴—代巴总统的健康，
    为在座的朋友们的健康，为社会主义事业的胜利
    干杯！
