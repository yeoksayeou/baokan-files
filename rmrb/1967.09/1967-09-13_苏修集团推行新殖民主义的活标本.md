On August 27, the Soviet revisionists' _Pravda_ published an article shamelessly covering up the Soviet revisionists' new colonialism in Mongolia, eagerly praising the Zedenbal revisionist clique, and claiming that "Leninist policies are being successfully implemented in Mongolia," that "the policies of the Mongolian revisionists are correct," and that the changes occurring on Mongolian soil are the result of the Soviet revisionists' "selfless aid to the Mongolian people."

What a "result of selfless aid"!

Fake is fake, and the disguise must be stripped away.

Now let us see the true face of the Soviet revisionists' "selfless aid"!

The Soviet revisionist clique seized power, restored capitalism internally, and implemented bourgeois dictatorship. Externally, they pursued a policy of plunder and enslavement of other nations, turning some countries into their satellites and colonies. The Zedenbal revisionist clique betrayed the proletariat and became traitors to their nation. The policies they implemented inevitably pushed Mongolia onto the road to becoming a colony.

The facts are exactly like this.

Through the Mongolian revisionist clique, this small group of agents, the Soviet revisionists have, by all means, implemented colonial policies in political, economic, cultural, and military aspects, completely controlling Mongolia. Every major domestic and foreign policy of the Mongolian revisionist party and government must be decided by this Soviet revisionist overlord behind the scenes.

Every year, the Soviet revisionists send large numbers of delegations, including high-level delegations from the party, government, military, and cultural sectors, frequently to Mongolia, ostensibly for "friendly visits," but in reality, they act as "masters" personally directing and interfering in all major activities in Mongolia. The Soviet revisionists have stationed tens of thousands of troops in Mongolia.

Large numbers of Soviet "experts" have flooded into Mongolia, directly controlling various important departments. Through a series of treaties and agreements ostensibly for "friendly mutual assistance and cooperation," but in reality for enslavement and plunder, the Soviet revisionists have legalized and continuously expanded their colonial interests in Mongolia. The Soviet revisionists use every possible channel to infiltrate Mongolia. Under the pretext of "international division of labor" and "economic cooperation," the Soviet revisionists, through "aid," loans, joint ventures, and other means, tightly control Mongolia's national economy and foreign trade, turning Mongolia into a raw material supply base, commodity sales market, and capital export destination for the Soviet revisionists.

The so-called "aid" and "preferential loans" from the Soviet revisionists to Mongolia are essentially loaned capital, a high-interest debt that the Mongolian people can never repay. Every time the Soviet revisionists provide "selfless aid" to Mongolia, they reap profits several times the original amount, leaving the Mongolian people with a heavy debt that increases year by year. According to official Mongolian statistics, from 1958 to 1966, Mongolia borrowed 60 billion old rubles from the Soviet Union, averaging 5,500 old rubles per Mongolian, making Mongolia the most indebted country in the world.

The debt Mongolia owes to the Soviet revisionists, if calculated based on the price of livestock exported to the Soviet Union during the three-year plan (1958-1960), exceeds ten times the value of all current livestock in Mongolia. Even if all livestock in Mongolia were sold, this debt could not be repaid!

Because the Zedenbal clique owes the Soviet revisionists a debt that can never be repaid, the Soviet revisionists firmly control Mongolia, and Mongolia cannot develop an independent economy, only to be manipulated and exploited by the Soviet revisionist clique. Through loan exploitation, Mongolia has actually become a pasture for the Soviet revisionists, and the Mongolian working people have actually become shepherds for the Soviet revisionists.

One of the cunning methods the Soviet revisionists use to exploit Mongolia is through "trade" to squeeze profits. However, the Soviet revisionists and the Zedenbal clique eagerly praise the Mongolian-Soviet trade as "equal and reciprocal," "equivalent exchange," and so on. Let us see what the so-called equivalent exchange in Mongolian-Soviet trade is! One tire imported from the Soviet Union is equivalent to forty sheep, one meter of cloth is equivalent to fifty kilograms of wool, one bicycle is equivalent to four horses, one radio is equivalent to twenty-six sheep, one can of food is equivalent to half a sheep, and one toy sheep is equivalent to a live sheep. This is the price of Mongolian-Soviet trade. The price of beef and mutton supplied to the Soviet Union by Mongolia is only half the price of the same meat sold to other countries. According to calculations, in 1962 alone, the Soviet Union made an additional income of over 21 million rubles from importing livestock and livestock products from Mongolia, resulting in a trade deficit of over 15 million rubles for Mongolia that year, which Mongolia could not repay and had to borrow. This is the so-called "fatherly care" of the Soviet Union that the Mongolian revisionist clique eagerly praises.

To repay the Soviet revisionists' "fatherly care," live livestock is continuously driven from Mongolian pastures to Soviet processing plants: approximately 15,000 head per day, 450,000 head per month, and 5.5 million head per year. In recent years, Mongolia's adult and strong livestock cannot fill the Soviet revisionists' "tiger's den"—meat processing plants. To satisfy the master's appetite, the Mongolian revisionist clique has even adopted a "kill the hen to get the eggs" policy, driving female livestock and young livestock to the Soviet Union. As a result, a vicious cycle has occurred in livestock production, with the number of livestock significantly decreasing. The total number of livestock has decreased from over 26 million head in 1940 to about 20 million head currently.

A century ago, Marx said in _British Rule in India_ that India was the homeland of cotton textiles, but British colonialism invaded India and gradually "filled this homeland of cotton textiles with British cotton textiles." Today, this tragedy is being repeated in Mongolia. The homeland of livestock, Mongolia, is not also filled with Soviet revisionist livestock products? Taking 1963 as an example, the obviously reduced figures published by the Mongolian and Soviet governments show that the country purchased a total of 114,000 tons of live cattle and sheep, exporting 88,100 tons to the Soviet Union, accounting for 80% of the total purchase; the country purchased 117,000 horses, exporting 83,700 to the Soviet Union, accounting for 71% of the purchase. Yesterday's Mongolian horses, cattle, and sheep have become today's Soviet-branded leather shoes, wool fabrics, canned food, and milk powder; yesterday's one horse is today's one pair of leather shoes, and yesterday's one sheep is today's two cans of meat. As a result, Mongolia's limited livestock is decreasing day by day, while Mongolia's debt is increasing day by day. This is the result of the Soviet revisionists' shameless boasting of "selfless aid." This is clearly the "survival of the fittest" in the capitalist world, where is the so-called "fatherly care"?

The Soviet revisionists also say that the Mongolian-Soviet "friendship" has brought "development and prosperity" to Mongolia, which is completely a lie! In terms of Mongolia's industry, there is not even a single machine manufacturing industry, let alone a decent repair factory. Machines break down and cannot be repaired, even ordinary parts depend on the Soviet Union for supply. During Mongolia's third five-year plan, the Mongolian revisionists requested the Soviet revisionists to help build machine industries and livestock product processing industries needed for the development of livestock husbandry. However, the Soviet revisionist clique, based on its own interests, rejected these requests under the pretext of opposing so-called "individual farming" and "international division of labor." Many existing factories and mines in Mongolia are merely processing industries serving the export of raw materials and semi-finished products to the Soviet Union. Before the wool mill built with our help was put into production in 1960, Mongolia could not weave a single inch of cloth. Looking at the livestock industry, which plays a decisive role in Mongolia's national economy, according to official Mongolian statistics, the total number of livestock in Mongolia was 24.47 million head in 1956, but by 1966, ten years later, it had decreased to over 22 million head, and in reality, it was far from reaching this number. Is there any sign of "development and prosperity" here?

The Mongolian revisionist clique says that the "constant care and various great aids" from the Soviet revisionists have always been the basis for the Mongolian people's victories and achievements. This is so flattering! Does this not mean that without "Soviet aid," the Mongolian people cannot take a single step? Only traitors who sell their country for personal gain have such logic! If the Soviet revisionists' so-called "aid" is a "basis," then it is the basis for Mongolia to become a colony under the Soviet revisionists' ruthless plunder, and it is the basis for the Mongolian revisionist clique to depend on the Soviet revisionists to eke out a living.

Lenin said: "A slave who praises the beautiful life of slavery and is deeply grateful to the kind and benevolent master is a lackey, a scoundrel." The Mongolian revisionist clique, for the sake of obtaining a small share of the profits that the Soviet revisionists squeeze from the Mongolian people, disregards the independence of the Mongolian nation, and for the sake of eating a bowl of leftovers, sells the interests of the Mongolian people, and is deeply grateful to the Soviet "master." Are they not the "lackeys" and "scoundrels" that Lenin condemned?

Ironclad facts have completely exposed the lies of the Soviet revisionists. Today, Mongolia under the control of the Mongolian revisionist clique is a living example of the Soviet revisionists' new colonialism.

    苏修集团推行新殖民主义的活标本	内蒙古大学井冈山兵团　内蒙古党委机关无产阶级革命派红旗联合总部　“中十八”革命造反总部卫东战斗队
    八月二十七日，苏修《真理报》发表文章，厚颜无耻地为苏修集团在蒙古推行新殖民主义打掩护，竭力美化泽登巴尔修正主义集团，胡说什么“列宁主义方针在蒙古顺利执行”，蒙修政策“是正确的”，蒙古土地上发生的变化，也是苏修“给予人民蒙古以巨大的无私援助的结果”。
    好一个“无私援助的结果”！
    假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。
    现在让我们来看看苏修“无私援助的结果”的真相吧！
    苏联修正主义集团篡夺了政权，他们对内复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政，对外推行掠夺和奴役其它民族的殖民政策，把别的一些国家变为它的附庸和殖民地。泽登巴尔修正主义集团背叛了无产阶级，成为民族的叛徒，他们所执行的政策，必然是把蒙古推上沦为殖民地的道路。
    事实正是这样。
    苏修通过蒙修集团这一小撮代理人，从政治、经济、文化以至军事方面，不择手段地推行殖民政策，全面控制了蒙古。蒙修党、政府的每一项重大国内外政策，都要由这个苏修太上皇幕后定夺。
    苏修每年派遣大量的代表团，包括党、政、军、文各方面的高级代表团，频繁赴蒙，名为“友好访问”，实际上是以“主人”的身份亲临现场“指导”和干预蒙古的一切重大活动。苏修用数以万计的军队进驻蒙古。
    苏修的“专家”大批大批地涌入蒙古，直接控制着蒙古各个重要部门。通过一系列名为“友好互助合作”、实为奴役和掠夺的各种条约和协定，使苏修在蒙古的殖民利益合法化并不断扩大。苏修利用一切可能利用的渠道，向蒙古进行全面渗透。在“国际分工”和“经济合作”的幌子下，苏修通过“援助”、贷款、合办企业等各种途径，紧紧控制了蒙古的国民经济和对外贸易，把蒙古变成了苏修的原料供应基地、商品销售市场和资本输出场所。
    苏修集团对蒙古的所谓“援助”和“优惠贷款”，实质上是向蒙古输出的借贷资本，是蒙古人民永远偿还不清的高利贷。苏修对蒙古的每一次“无私援助”，都是以几倍于“老本”的高额利润捞了回去，而剩下的则是蒙古人民身上的重债，年复一年的增加。据蒙古官方公布的资料，粗略统计，从一九五八年——一九六六年，蒙古向苏联贷款达六十亿旧卢布，平均每个蒙古人负债五千五百旧卢布，可以说是世界上负债最重的国家。
    蒙古对苏修欠下的债务，如果按蒙古在三年（一九五八年至一九六○年）计划期间，向苏联出口牲畜的价格计算，超过了蒙古现有全部牲畜的十倍以上。就是把蒙古所有的牲畜全部卖掉也偿还不清这笔债！
    由于泽登巴尔集团对苏修欠下了世世代代还不清的债务，苏修牢牢掌握了蒙古，蒙古也就无法发展独立自主的经济，只能听任苏修集团摆布和剥削。苏修集团通过贷款的盘剥，蒙古实际上已经变成了苏修集团的牧场，蒙古劳动人民实际上成了苏修集团的羊倌。
    苏修对蒙古进行剥削的一个巧妙手法，就是通过
  “贸易”进行榨取。但是，苏修和泽登巴尔集团却竭力吹嘘什么蒙苏贸易是“平等互惠”、“等价交换”等等。让我们来看一看蒙苏贸易的所谓等价交换是什么货色！蒙古从苏联进口一个轮胎等于四十只羊，一米呢料相当于五十公斤羊毛，一辆自行车相当于四匹马，一台收音机等于二十六只羊，一盒罐头等于半只羊，一个玩具羊顶一只活羊。这就是苏蒙贸易价格。蒙古供应苏联的牛羊肉的价格，只相当于卖给其他国家的同等肉价的一半。据计算，仅一九六二年苏联从蒙古进口牲畜和畜产品原料捞取二千一百多万卢布的额外收入，使蒙古当年的蒙苏贸易出现了一千五百多万卢布的逆差，蒙古无力偿还就转入贷款。这就是蒙修集团拚命宣扬的所谓苏联对蒙古“父亲般的关怀”。
    蒙修集团为了报答苏修的“父亲般的关怀”，活牲畜源源不断地从蒙古的牧场上赶往苏联的加工厂：大约一天一万五千头，一个月四十五万头，一年五百五十万头。近几年来，蒙古的公畜和壮畜填不满苏修的“老虎洞”——肉类加工厂。蒙修集团为了满足主子的胃口，干脆采取了“杀鸡取蛋”的政策，竟将母畜连小畜一起赶往苏联。结果，在畜牧业生产中出现了严重的恶性循环，牲畜头数大大减少。使牲畜总头数从一九四○年的二千六百多万头，减少到目前的二千来万头。
    一个世纪以前，马克思在《不列颠在印度的统治》一文中曾说，印度是个棉织品的祖国，而英国殖民主义侵入印度之后，逐步地“就使这个棉织品的祖国，充满了英国的棉织品”。今天，这种悲剧在蒙古重演了。畜牧业祖国的蒙古，不也正是充满了苏修的畜产品吗？以一九六三年为例，蒙、苏官方公布的显然是缩小了的数字表明，全国共征购牛羊活畜十一万四千吨，向苏联出口达八万八千一百吨，占全国征购量的百分之八十；全国征购马十一万七千匹，向苏联出口达八万三千七百匹，占征购量的百分之七十一。昨天还是蒙古的马牛羊，今天就变成了贴上苏联商标的皮鞋、毛料、罐头和奶粉；昨天付出一匹马，今天只能买回一双皮鞋，付出一头羊，只能换回两个肉罐头。结果是，蒙古有数的牲畜一天天减少，而蒙古的债台却一天天高筑。这就是苏修集团无耻吹嘘的所谓“无私援助的结果”。这明明是资本主义世界的“弱肉强食”，那里来的什么“父亲般的关怀”！
    苏修集团还说什么苏蒙“友谊”给蒙古带来了“发展和繁荣”，这完全是骗人的鬼话！以蒙古的工业而论，不仅没有自己的机器制造业，就是一个象样的修配厂都没有，机器坏了自己不能修理，连普通零件也依靠苏联配制。在蒙古第三个五年计划期间，蒙修要求苏修帮助建设发展畜牧业所需要的机器工业和畜产品加工工业，但是苏修集团从本国利益出发，借口反对所谓“单干”，假借“国际分工”等等，一一顶回。现有的蒙古许多厂矿也只是专为向苏联输出原料和半成品服务的加工工业而已。在我国帮助新建的毛纺厂一九六○年投入生产以前，蒙古是寸布不能织的。再看在蒙古国民经济中占决定地位的畜牧业，据蒙古官方公布的资料，一九五六年蒙古牲畜总头数是二千四百四十七万头，而到十年以后的一九六六年已经下降到二千二百多万头了，而实际上远远没有达到这个数字。这里有一点“发展和繁荣”的影子吗？
    蒙修集团说什么苏修“给予的经常关怀和各种巨大援助，一向是蒙古人民取得胜利和成就的基础的基础”，这又是多么肉麻！这岂不是说，离开了“苏援”，蒙古人民就寸步难行吗？只有卖国求荣的奴才才有这样的逻辑！如果说苏修的这种所谓“援助”是什么“基础”的话，那就是蒙古在苏修的残酷掠夺下，沦为殖民地的基础，是蒙修集团依附于苏修赖以混日子的基础。
    列宁说：“津津乐道地赞赏美妙的奴隶生活并对和善的好心的主人感激不尽的奴隶，是奴才，是无耻之徒。”蒙修集团，为了从苏修集团在蒙古人民身上敲骨吸髓的利润中，得到一点零头，而置蒙古民族的独立于不顾，为了吞食一碗残羹剩饭，而拍卖蒙古人民的利益，并且对苏修“主人感激不尽”，他们不正是列宁所痛斥的这种“奴才”和“无耻之徒”吗？
    铁的事实完全揭穿了苏修集团的谎言。今天蒙修集团控制下的蒙古是苏修集团推行新殖民主义的一个不折不扣的活标本。
