The Indonesian fascist regime led by Suharto and Nasution brazenly "invited" the so-called "trade delegation" sent by the enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, to Jakarta to engage in conspiratorial activities on September 11. The Chinese chargé d'affaires, Lü Zibo, went to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the same day to lodge the strongest protest against this serious political provocation.

Lü Zibo stated: While the Indonesian government has been frantically engaging in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, it has been secretly and openly in frequent contact with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan, colluding with them and intensifying their comprehensive collusion. Now, they have even brazenly "invited" the so-called "trade delegation" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to Indonesia to engage in activities. Jakarta newspapers have been widely publicizing this, saying: "This is the first delegation in twenty years since Indonesia and Taipei have had no relations." Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik has even openly declared that Indonesia might establish a relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits that is "one level higher than commercial representation." He even more brazenly said: "If Taiwan declares the establishment of the Republic of Taiwan, then we will recognize it." Indonesian newspapers have long openly referred to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who is despised by the Chinese people, as the "head of state of Taiwan," and referred to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as the "government," and so on.

Lü Zibo pointed out that all of this clearly shows that the Indonesian government is actively working to serve the U.S. imperialist plot of creating "two Chinas," thoroughly destroying the relations between China and Indonesia. This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, an extremely serious provocation against the 700 million Chinese people, and the Chinese embassy expresses great indignation and lodges the strongest protest against the Indonesian government.

Lü Zibo sternly warned the Indonesian government: The small clique of Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupying Taiwan is a political zombie preserved by U.S. imperialism that has long been rotten and stinking, a political tool for U.S. imperialism to invade China and Asia. Your collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits only shows that you are of the same ilk as them, and it thoroughly exposes your extremely reactionary nature and your malicious intention to be enemies of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    印尼法西斯政权公然“邀请”政治僵尸蒋帮“贸易代表团”到雅加达
    我驻印尼大使馆提出最强烈抗议
    新华社十二日讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权，十一日公然“邀请”中国人民公敌蒋介石派遣的所谓“贸易代表团”到雅加达进行阴谋活动。中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办吕子波当天前往印尼外交部，就这一严重政治挑衅事件向印尼法西斯军人政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    吕子波说：印尼政府在疯狂反华排华的同时，一直同台湾蒋介石匪帮明里暗里，频频接触，狼狈为奸，加紧全面勾结。现在竟公然“邀请”蒋帮的所谓“贸易代表团”来印尼活动。雅加达报纸对此大肆宣扬说：“这是印尼和台北没有关系的二十年来第一个代表团”。印尼外交部长马利克也公然叫嚷印尼可能同蒋帮建立“比商务代表高一级”的关系。他甚至更露骨地说：“如果台湾宣布成立台湾共和国，那么我们将承认它。”印尼报刊早就公然把中国人民所唾弃了的卖国贼蒋介石称为“台湾国家元首”，称蒋介石匪帮为“政府”等。
    吕子波指出，所有这一切都清楚地表明，印尼政府正在加紧为美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋奔走效劳，彻底破坏中国和印尼的关系。这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是对七亿中国人民极端严重的挑衅，中国大使馆对此表示极大的愤慨，并向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    吕子波严厉警告印尼政府：窃踞台湾的一小撮蒋介石匪帮是美帝所保存的早已腐朽发臭的一具政治僵尸，是美帝侵略中国和亚洲的政治工具。你们和蒋帮勾结在一起，只能表明你们同他们是一路货，也彻底暴露了你们极端反动的本质和蓄意与中国人民和世界人民为敌的丑恶嘴脸。
