Only Promote Unity, Do Not Create Division

In the face of the relentless storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class enemy fears nothing more than the overwhelming force of the great revolutionary unity. Because when the proletarian revolutionary masses unite, this handful of class enemies will inevitably be isolated and thoroughly defeated. Therefore, the class enemy always tries every means to sabotage the revolutionary unity. The proletarian revolutionary masses must use the keen and penetrating Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly expose and smash the class enemy's plots and tricks. There is no fundamental conflict of interest among the revolutionary masses. Facing a common enemy, for a common revolutionary goal, the revolutionary masses should quickly achieve great revolutionary unity, unite together, fight together, and win together, and there is no reason to continue the "internal war" and create divisions.

In the final assault on the bourgeois headquarters, if the proletarian revolutionary masses do not unite but instead fight each other, not only will they fail to completely destroy the bourgeois headquarters, but they will also let the enemy escape. Can we do such a thing? No. We must not do things that cause pain to our friends and joy to our enemies.

To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must vigorously promote great revolutionary unity in the great criticism of the revolution. Those who lack sincerity in unity and continue to create divisions and wage "internal war" are deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and are sliding into a dangerous ditch.

    只能促进联合，不能制造分裂
    在摧枯拉朽的无产阶级文化大革命风暴面前，阶级敌人最惧怕的是浩浩荡荡的革命大联合。因为无产阶级革命派联合起来，他们这一小撮就必然孤立，彻底垮台。所以阶级敌人总要挖空心思地破坏革命的大联合。无产阶级革命派应该用明察秋毫的毛泽东思想，彻底揭穿和粉碎阶级敌人玩弄的阴谋诡计。革命群众之间没有根本的利害冲突。面对共同的敌人，为了一个共同的革命目标，革命派应该迅速地实现革命的大联合，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，而没有任何理由再继续打“内战”，闹分裂。
    在向资产阶级司令部发动总攻击中，无产阶级革命派如果不联合起来而互相扭打，那就不但不能彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部，反而会放走了敌人。难道我们能够这样作吗？不能。我们决不要作亲者痛、仇者快的事。
    要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是要在革命的大批判中，大力促进革命的大联合。谁若在联合上没有诚意，仍然闹分裂，打“内战”，谁就是背离毛主席的革命路线，使自己滑到危险的阴沟里。
