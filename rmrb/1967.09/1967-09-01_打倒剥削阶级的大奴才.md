Title: Overthrow the Big Lackey of the Exploiting Class

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is a big lackey of the exploiting class. He stands on the side of the landlords and rich peasants, advocating the fallacies of "exploitation is guiltless" and "exploitation is meritorious," claiming that "exploitation saves people" and "the more one exploits, the greater the merit." This is all nonsense, utterly shameless!

Is exploitation really guiltless? I say exploitation is guilty, guilty beyond measure!

In the old society, our village of Dazhai had a total of sixty-seven households, cultivating eight hundred mu of land. Among them, four households of landlords and rich peasants owned four hundred and eighty mu of land, while fifty-one households of poor and lower-middle peasants only owned one hundred and forty-four mu. We poor and lower-middle peasants could not make a living, mainly relying on being long-term or short-term laborers, selling our labor to feed our families. However, we toiled day and night, working so hard that we were exhausted, but in the end, we still could not eat our fill, could not keep warm, and lived in poverty, begging for food and clothing. Take my family, for example. In the old society, I worked as a long-term laborer for a rich peasant for twenty-five years, but in the end, I had no house to live in and no land to till. My wife, Song Liying, started working as a maid for the rich peasant Jia Dengyuan's family at the age of eleven. In the Jia household, she endured beatings and scoldings, hunger and cold. She ground grain, pushed the millstone, washed dishes, and scrubbed pots. She was small, so she had to stand on a small stool to reach the sink. The sink edge wore her already tattered clothes until her belly was exposed. When she could no longer wear them, she asked Jia Dengyuan's wife for a patch. But this she-devil said, "Are you afraid of wearing out your belly? It can grow back, so what's the big deal!"

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, you tell me, is this exploitation saving people? Is this the merit of exploitation? No, this is the heinous crime of the exploiting system!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In this world, there is no such thing as love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party loves capitalism and hates socialism. He peddles this philosophy of cannibalism, entirely to serve the development of capitalism and the maintenance of the bloody exploiting system. His voice is the voice of vampires and parasites. This is a complete exposure of his filthy and ugly bourgeois soul. We must expose his ugly face as a big lackey of the exploiting class, let him be reviled for eternity, and never allow him to rise again!

　　打倒剥削阶级的大奴才
　　贾进才
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是剥削阶级的大奴才。他站在地主、富农的立场上，宣扬“剥削无罪”、“剥削有功”的谬论，胡说什么“剥削是救人”，“剥削得越多功劳越大”。这完全是颠倒黑白的鬼话，无耻透顶！
    剥削真的无罪吗？我说剥削有罪，罪恶滔天！
    旧社会，我们大寨共有六十七户，耕种着八百亩土地。其中四户地主、富农就占有土地四百八十亩，而五十一户贫下中农只占有土地一百四十四亩。我们贫下中农无法生活，主要靠扛长工、打短工、出卖劳动力，来养家糊口。但是，我们顶着星星，披着月亮，累死累活劳动一年，到头来还是吃不饱，穿不暖，过着讨吃要喝、衣不遮体的穷苦生活。就拿我家来说吧，旧社会我给富农整整扛了二十五年长工，结果是房无一间，地无一垄。我的老伴宋立英，十一岁就给富农贾登元家当了丫头。在贾家，她挨打受骂、忍饥挨饿。她滚碾，推磨，洗锅，刷碗。她个子小，洗碗够不着锅台，要踩上小凳子洗，锅台把她本来就破烂不堪的衣服磨得露出了肚皮，实在不能穿了，她去找贾登元的老婆要一块补钉，谁知这个母老虎却说：“肚皮还怕磨破？磨破了还能长出来，怕什么！”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，你说说，这是剥削救人吗？这是剥削的功劳吗？不，这是剥削制度的滔天罪恶！
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派爱的是资本主义，恨的是社会主义。他贩卖这一套吃人的哲学，完全是为发展资本主义、维护血腥的剥削制度服务的。他这种声音是吸血鬼和寄生虫的声音，这是他自己那种肮脏丑恶的资产阶级灵魂的大暴露。我们必须戳穿他的剥削阶级大奴才的丑恶嘴脸，让他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
