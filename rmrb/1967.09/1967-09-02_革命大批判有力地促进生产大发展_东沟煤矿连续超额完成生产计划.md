The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of Donggou Coal Mine in Qinghai Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are making revolution above ground and promoting production below ground. They are both revolutionary pioneers and production models. With the support and help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai, they are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, deeply carrying out the great criticism of the revolution, and powerfully promoting the great development of production. Since the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction took power in April, coal production has exceeded the state plan every month. The coal production in August is expected to exceed the production plan by more than 10%, breaking the record of the highest monthly production in the past two years. At the same time, production costs are continuously reduced, and the quality of raw coal has significantly improved.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction fought a fierce struggle with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, seized their power, and achieved great victories in the cultural revolution. Under the support and help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qinghai, all revolutionary workers in the mine launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carried out the great criticism of the revolution.

In the great criticism of the revolution, the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers denounced the reactionary fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious" propagated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and deeply criticized the stinking goods of revisionism such as "money is the commander" and "material incentives." Through the great criticism of the revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers have further aroused their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, producing more coal and better coal for the revolution.

The "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction of Donggou Coal Mine insists on "making revolution on the spot, making revolution in spare time, and making revolution economically," and adheres to the eight-hour workday system. In mid-August, they went to Xining City to participate in the celebration of the establishment of the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee and immediately made up for the production time lost upon their return. They also pay attention to correctly handling contradictions among the people, winning over, educating, and uniting the deceived masses, and together engaging in the struggle to grasp revolution and promote production.

    革命大批判有力地促进生产大发展
　　东沟煤矿连续超额完成生产计划
    据新华社西宁一日电　青海省东沟煤矿“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，既做革命的闯将，又当生产的模范。他们在人民解放军青海驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展革命的大批判，有力地促进了生产的大发展。从四月份“八·一八”无产阶级革命派掌权以来，煤炭生产月月超额完成国家计划。八月份煤产量预计可以超额完成生产计划百分之十以上，打破两年来月产量的最高纪录。同时，生产成本不断降低，原煤质量有很大提高。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行了艰苦激烈的斗争，夺了他们的权，取得了文化大革命的巨大胜利。在青海驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，全矿革命职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，开展了革命的大批判。
    在革命的大批判中，“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和革命职工痛斥党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的“剥削有功”等反动谬论，深刻批判了“钞票挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义的臭货。通过革命的大批判，更激发了无产阶级革命派和革命职工对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线的无限热爱。他们热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，不怕苦，不怕累，为革命多产煤，产好煤。
    东沟煤矿“八·一八”无产阶级革命派坚持“就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命”，坚持八小时工作制。八月中旬，他们到西宁市去参加庆祝青海省革命委员会成立大会，回来后马上把耽误的生产补上。他们还注意正确处理人民内部矛盾，争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众，一起投入抓革命、促生产的斗争。
