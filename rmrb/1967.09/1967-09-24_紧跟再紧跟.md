The latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao is like a strong east wind that has blown into the Beijing Radio Equipment Factory, bringing immense strength to the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat.

Liu Zhenzhong from the Technology Group held the newspaper, reading the latest directive several times in one breath. As he read, he became more and more excited, repeatedly saying, "Chairman Mao's words have struck our hearts. The two factions should unite immediately." He then eagerly rushed to the Service Group and said to the service worker Kang Duqiang, "Old Kang, in the past, we held our ground and fought 'internal wars' with others, which was really wrong. Now, Chairman Mao has issued the latest directive, and we must execute it without any deviation!"

Old Kang said, "Let's wait a bit more!" Old Liu heard this and became anxious, saying, "We can't wait. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest directive closely. If we fall behind even one step, it will be hard to catch up." Saying this, he handed the *People's Daily* to him, urging him to read immediately:

"Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions."

Old Kang read Chairman Mao's latest directive word by word, becoming more and more excited. Suddenly, he grabbed Old Liu's two hands, excitedly saying, "Old Liu, you're right. We must follow Chairman Mao's directive closely and not delay!"

The next day, Old Kang and several other service workers from different organizations had a friendly discussion. During the meeting, everyone made self-criticisms, and they quickly reached an agreement on the great alliance of the revolution.

　　紧跟再紧跟
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，象一股强劲的东风，吹到了北京无线电仪器厂，给无产阶级革命派战士带来了无比的力量。
    工艺组的刘振中捧着报纸，把这段最新指示一口气看了十几遍。他边读边想，越想越兴奋，连连说：“毛主席的话说到咱们心里啦，咱们两大派应当立即联合起来才对。”说着，就兴冲冲地跑到勤务组，对勤务员康多强说：“老康，过去咱们抱山头，和人家打‘内战’，实在不对头。现在，毛主席发出了最新指示，咱们可得不折不扣地执行啊！”
    老康说：“咱们再等等吧！”老刘一听不觉急了，说：“不能等，要紧跟毛主席的最新指示。一步跟不紧，步步难跟上。”说着，便把《人民日报》给他，要他立即读：
      “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”老康一个字一个字地读着毛主席的最新指示，越看越兴奋，突然，他抓住老刘的两只手，激动地说：“老刘，你说得对，毛主席的指示咱们就得紧跟，不能迟延！”
    第二天，老康和其他几个组织的勤务员，高高兴兴地进行了友好的协商。会上，大家都作了自我批评，很快就达成了革命大联合的协议。
