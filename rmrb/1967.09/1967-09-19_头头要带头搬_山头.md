Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the working class has even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions. Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest instructions to the revolutionary masses across the nation. A new wave of revolutionary unity is surging across all fronts.

Achieving revolutionary unity requires the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to play a crucial role.

Leaders are the vanguard. If the vanguard leads well, they can guide the masses along Chairman Mao's revolutionary path; if they lead poorly, they may lead the masses astray. If a leader of a revolutionary mass organization harbors antagonistic feelings towards other revolutionary mass organizations, fails to honestly explain the true nature of the disagreements to the masses, and does not take the lead in self-criticism during the process of unity, refusing to touch the kingdom of petty-bourgeois factionalism, then it will be impossible to eliminate factionalism and anarchism within their own organization. It will also be impossible to unite the majority and organize a mighty revolutionary force to focus on criticizing and fighting against the capitalist roaders in power, headed by China's Khrushchev. Even if such a leader can deceive some masses for a certain period, the masses will eventually remove the obstacles to great unity.

"Leaders must always be at the forefront of the movement, not lagging behind." We hope that all leaders of revolutionary mass organizations will always remember Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings, strictly demand of themselves, overcome all selfish thoughts, and not become stumbling blocks to revolutionary unity. We also hope that the revolutionary masses will use Mao Zedong Thought to strictly demand of and supervise their own leaders, making every "command center" of a revolutionary mass organization a "locomotive" for revolutionary unity, charging forward in the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao.

    头头要带头搬“山头”
    在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。我们伟大领袖毛主席向全国无产阶级革命派发出了最新指示。一个革命大联合的新高潮正在全国各条战线上兴起。
    实现革命大联合，革命群众组织的头头起着重要的作用。
    头头是领队的，领队的人带得好，就能带领群众沿着毛主席的革命轨道前进；带得不好，就可能把群众引入歧途。如果一个革命群众组织的头头对其他革命群众组织持有对立情绪，自己又不如实地向群众讲明分歧的真实情况；在联合过程中自己不带头进行自我批评，不敢触动小资产阶级派性的王国，就不可能反掉自己团体中的山头主义、无政府主义，就不可能团结大多数，组织浩浩荡荡的革命军，集中力量，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判大斗争。这样的群众组织的头头即使在一定时期内会蒙蔽一些群众，但群众会起来搬掉障碍大联合的石头。
    “领导一定要走在运动的前面，不要落在它的后面。”我们希望所有革命群众组织的负责人要永远牢记毛主席的亲切教导，严格要求自己，克服一切私心杂念，不要成为革命大联合的绊脚石。我们也希望革命群众要用毛泽东思想去严格要求和帮助督促自己组织的头头，使每一个革命群众组织的“指挥部”，成为革命大联合的“火车头”，奔向伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向。
