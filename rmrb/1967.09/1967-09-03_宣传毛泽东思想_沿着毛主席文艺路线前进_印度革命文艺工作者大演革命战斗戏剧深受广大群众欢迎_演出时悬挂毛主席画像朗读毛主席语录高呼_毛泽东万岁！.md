Indian revolutionary literary workers are performing revolutionary and militant dramas that are highly popular among the masses. During the performances, they hang portraits of Chairman Mao, read quotations from Chairman Mao, and shout “Long live Mao Zedong!”

NEW DELHI, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) — Indian revolutionary literary workers, undeterred by the reactionary government’s persecution, are actively promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the masses and enthusiastically singing the praises of the revolutionary people’s armed struggle. Their revolutionary literary performances have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses.

Revolutionary literary workers in West Bengal have overcome numerous difficulties to stage a drama in the Calcutta Theater that praises the armed struggle of the peasants in Naxalbari. The performance was conducted under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought. A large portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform was prominently displayed on the stage, along with the quotation “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” During the intermission, the performers loudly read excerpts from Chairman Mao’s brilliant work “Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan.”

According to reports, this performance emphasized the “victory of the gun” and highlighted the role of the peasant movement, indicating the Indian people’s determination to revolt. Indian revolutionaries believe that this is a significant development in the cultural sphere of West Bengal, marking a step toward revolution.

Indian revolutionary literary workers are striving to advance along the revolutionary literary line guided by Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao’s brilliant work “Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art” for providing a comprehensive and profound exposition of all aspects of proletarian literary theory, considering it a guiding principle for their literary work. Recently, Indian revolutionary literary warriors also performed the play “Unconquerable Vietnam” in Calcutta, supporting the Vietnamese people’s war of resistance against American aggression and exposing the crimes of American imperialism.

This play enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The guerrillas in the play clearly state: “We will follow the principles of guerrilla warfare advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong to strike the enemy and achieve victory,” “We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and fear no difficulties; we are determined to persevere to the end.” The climax of the play is when the guerrillas annihilate the American devils, raise their weapons, celebrate victory, and shout “Long live Mao Zedong!” The performers also sing “The East Is Red” in the play.

The Indian people warmly welcome this play. On the night of the performance, it was raining heavily in Calcutta, but the theater was packed with spectators. It is said that this play has been performed in Calcutta for a long time, attracting tens of thousands of viewers.

The revolutionary people of Mali love the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. This is a photo of Malian students and Chinese experts singing “The East Is Red” together.

    新华社二日讯　新德里消息：印度革命文艺工作者不怕反动政府的迫害，积极在群众中宣传毛泽东思想，热情歌颂革命人民的武装斗争。他们的革命文艺演出，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    西孟加拉邦的革命文艺工作者冲破重重困难，在加尔各答剧院中公演歌颂纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争的戏剧。演出是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下进行的。舞台上高挂身穿军装的毛主席巨幅画像，挂着毛主席的语录“枪杆子里面出政权”。演出间歇时，演员们高声朗读毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》的主要部分。
    据报道，这次演出突出了“枪杆子的胜利”，突出了农民运动的作用，表明印度人民决心起来革命。印度革命派认为，这是西孟加拉邦文化界“走向革命的意义重大的发展”。
    印度革命文艺工作者正在努力沿着毛主席指引的革命文艺路线前进。他们颂扬毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》“把无产阶级文艺理论的各方面问题，都作了全面精辟的论述”，认为这篇著作是他们进行文艺工作的指针。最近，印度革命文艺战士还在加尔各答演出了话剧《不可征服的越南》，支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，揭露美帝侵略的罪行。
    这个话剧热情歌颂毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想。剧中的游击队战士明确地说：“要根据毛泽东同志的游击战争原则，去打击敌人，赢得胜利”，“我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，不怕任何困难，要决心坚持到底”。剧的最后高潮是：游击队消灭了美国鬼子，全体战士举起武器，欢呼胜利，高呼“毛泽东万岁！”演员们还在剧中高唱《东方红》。
    印度人民十分欢迎这个话剧。演出的当天晚上，加尔各答市下着大雨，但是，剧院里挤满了观众。据说，这个戏已经在加尔各答演了很久，观众达数十万人。（附图片）
