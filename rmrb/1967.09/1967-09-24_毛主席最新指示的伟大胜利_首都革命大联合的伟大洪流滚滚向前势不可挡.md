Chairman Mao's latest instructions have achieved great victory. The great tide of revolutionary unity in the capital is rolling forward, irresistible.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

On the occasion of National Day, the revolutionary masses of the capital resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, launching a high tide of revolutionary unity. Red flags fluttered everywhere in Beijing's streets, and drums beat loudly. They formed a vast procession to report their joy to Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and to report their joy to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the supporting People's Liberation Army.

The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Third Textile Mill, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieved revolutionary unity with the spirit of "seizing the day." This is the preparation workshop where the two revolutionary mass organizations are writing a report of joy, celebrating the victory of revolutionary unity.

The working class of the entire nation quickly united, the Red Guards quickly united, and the proletarian revolutionary factions of all fronts quickly united. In the historical tide of revolutionary unity, new merits will be established and new victories will be welcomed!

	Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, long live revolutionary unity!
