The Indian revisionist elements and the Indian reactionaries are birds of a feather. The Indian revisionist government of Kerala State openly received a "fact-finding mission" that included members of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

New Delhi, September 8 (Xinhua) — The Kerala State government, headed by Nambudiripad, a leader of the Indian Communist Party (Revisionist), recently openly received a so-called "fact-finding mission" that included members of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This is a deliberate provocation by the Indian revisionists against the Chinese people.

According to the Indian News Agency, this "fact-finding mission" of the "Asian Productivity Organization," composed of members from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and representatives from India, Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, operated in Kerala State from September 2 to 6. They inspected some state-run enterprises in the state and held talks with representatives of these enterprises.

A member of the Chiang bandits in this "fact-finding mission" even made a statement to the press, praising the "economic development" of Kerala State under the rule of the Nambudiripad government.

This "fact-finding mission" was ostensibly formed to investigate the "market technology" of India, Japan, and Taiwan. In reality, this is a step in the tightening of collusion between the Indian reactionary government and the Chiang bandits.

On the very day this "fact-finding mission" concluded its activities in Kerala State, seventy extremely reactionary members of the Congress Party, the Freedom Party, and the People's Alliance in the Indian Parliament demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with China and the establishment of "diplomatic ties" with the Chiang bandits. This once again shows that Indian revisionist leaders like Nambudiripad and those extremely pro-American reactionary politicians are in cahoots on the anti-China issue. They are nothing but birds of a feather.

　　印修分子同印度反动派是一丘之貉
　　印修喀拉拉邦政府公然接待有蒋帮分子参加的“调查组”
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：由印共修正主义分子南布迪里巴德担任首席部长的印度喀拉拉邦政府，最近公然接待了一个有蒋介石匪帮分子参加的所谓“调查组”。这是印度修正主义分子公然对中国人民进行的蓄意挑衅。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，这个由蒋匪帮分子和印度、日本、泰国、菲律宾等国代表组成的“亚洲生产组织调查组”，从二日到六日在喀拉拉邦活动了五天。它视察了邦内的一些官办企业，并且同这些企业的代表举行了会谈。
    这个“调查组”内的一名蒋帮分子居然向新闻记者发表谈话，吹捧南布迪里巴德政府统治下的喀拉拉邦的“经济发展”。
    这个“调查组”名义上是为了调查印度、日本和台湾的“市场技术”而组成的。实际上，这是印度反动政府同蒋匪帮加紧勾结的一个步骤。
    就在这个“调查组”在喀拉拉邦活动结束的那一天，在印度议会内，国大党、自由党、人民同盟等政党的七十名极端反动的议员，叫嚷要同中国断绝外交关系，同蒋匪帮“建交”。这再次表明，南布迪里巴德等印共修正主义分子，同那些极端亲美的反动政客，在反华问题上一唱一和。他们只不过是一丘之貉。
