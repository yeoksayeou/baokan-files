In the call of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, the tide of revolutionary unity in the capital surges forward, rolling on unstoppably. The working class takes the lead in revolutionary unity, and the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of various fronts closely follow. From the 19th to the 21st, within just three days, 800 units that have achieved revolutionary unity have reported to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two opposing factions," have swiftly spread to every corner of the capital. With boundless loyalty and faith in Chairman Mao, the working class has studied these latest instructions and immediately taken action. Many factories and enterprises have achieved revolutionary unity in a very short time. Today, all revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing Iron and Steel Corporation's affiliated factories, mines, engineering companies, and departments have united. The steel workers say: We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We must always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, unite like steel, and wield our iron arms and steel fists to overthrow and expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate all their poisonous influences. The ten revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing Steel Plant, which were divided into two factions, immediately took action after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and quickly achieved revolutionary unity, forming the United Front of Proletarian Revolutionaries of Beijing Steel Plant. So far, eleven units in the Beijing metallurgical industry system have united.

Chairman Mao's voice reached the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and the coal miners were overjoyed and took immediate action to achieve revolutionary unity, holding a celebration meeting. The workers expressed their determination to fully unleash the immense power of revolutionary unity, deeply launch the revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and strive for double victories in revolution and production. Most of the stations, locomotive, and passenger transport units under the Beijing Railway Bureau have achieved revolutionary unity. The railway workers proudly declared: Revolutionary unity has created excellent conditions for seizing the revolution and promoting production. We must do a good job in revolutionary criticism and ensure the completion of transportation tasks.

According to statistics from the Beijing machinery, instrumentation, chemical, light industry, and urban construction systems, by today, the units that have achieved revolutionary unity account for about 80% of the total number of their affiliated enterprises.

In the city's financial and commercial front, eleven systems, including commerce, services, grain, supply and marketing, the People's Bank, and hotels, have achieved revolutionary unity in their directly affiliated enterprises within one day. The revolutionary mass organizations of large department stores such as the Beijing Department Store, Dongfeng Market, Dongsi People's Market, and Tianqiao Market have quickly achieved revolutionary unity with the spirit of "seizing the day."

The Red Guards and revolutionary students of the capital's colleges and universities have learned from the working class and rushed forward, launching a new high tide of revolutionary unity. Following the establishment of revolutionary committees in the original sixteen colleges and universities, in the past two days, more than ten colleges and universities, including Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing Broadcasting Institute, Beijing Institute of Light Industry, Beijing Medical College, Beijing Second Medical College, Beijing Language Institute, Beijing Institute of Chemical Fiber Engineering, and Hebei Beijing Normal University, have achieved revolutionary unity. Today, the Revolutionary Committee of the Capital's Colleges and Universities held a meeting in the new high tide of revolutionary unity. Representatives from 62 colleges and universities gathered to discuss the experiences, feelings, and resolutions of revolutionary unity. At the meeting, representatives from Tsinghua University and the University of Science and Technology of China shared their experiences and insights on achieving revolutionary unity. Representatives from colleges and universities that have not yet achieved revolutionary unity expressed their determination to learn from their comrades who have already achieved revolutionary unity, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to quickly achieve revolutionary unity, welcoming the National Day with practical actions. By tonight, more than 260 middle schools in the city have achieved revolutionary unity. Many schools' two revolutionary factions have sat together to study and chat. They said, "In the past, we were blinded by petty-bourgeois factionalism, entangled in trivial matters, and entangled in 'selfishness'; Chairman Mao's latest instructions have enlightened our eyes. We resolutely use proletarian party spirit to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and will no longer be called this faction or that faction. We will firmly be the revolutionary faction of Mao Zedong Thought."

In the past two days, a batch of municipal organs in industry, transportation, postal and telecommunications, finance and commerce, education, and health have also achieved revolutionary unity. Twenty-three out of the thirty directly affiliated cultural units in Beijing have united. The medical and health system has more than sixty units, including Beijing Hospital, Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Stomatological Hospital, Children's Hospital, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Chaoyang Hospital, Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Hospital, and Tian Tan Hospital, as well as the Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health, achieving revolutionary unity. The various units of the Beijing News and Publishing System have all united today.

In these days, the streets of Beijing are filled with red flags, drums, and gongs, and the queues reporting to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and the leadership of the Beijing Garrison Command to report the good news to Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and the People's Liberation Army supporting the left are endless. The revolutionary masses who have achieved revolutionary unity excitedly said: Achieving revolutionary unity is to listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the future, we will further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity, and do a better job in revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units!

    毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”，已经迅速传遍首都的每一个角落。工人阶级怀着对毛主席无限忠诚、无限信仰的心情，学习了这一最新指示，并立即行动起来。许多工厂企业在很短时间内就实现了革命的大联合。首都钢铁公司所属各厂矿、工程公司和处、室的各革命群众组织，今天全部联合起来了。钢铁工人们说：我们工人最听毛主席的话，我们要永远记住毛主席的指示，团结得象钢铁一般，挥动铁臂钢拳，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们的一切流毒。分成两大派的北京钢厂十个革命群众组织，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，立即行动，很快实现了革命大联合，组成了统一的北京钢厂无产阶级革命派联合会。到今天为止，北京冶金工业系统已有十一个单位联合起来。

    首都大专院校和中等学校的红卫兵小将、革命师生，向工人阶级学习，急起直追，掀起了革命大联合新高潮。继原有十六所大专院校成立革命委员会之后，这两天，又有清华大学、中国人民大学、中国科学技术大学、北京广播学院、北京轻工业学院、北京医学院、北京第二医学院、北京语言学院、北京化学纤维工学院、河北北京师范学院等十多所大专院校实现了革命的大联合。今天，首都大专院校红代会在革命大联合的新高潮中召开会议。六十二所大专院校的各革命群众组织负责人欢聚在一起，畅谈革命大联合的经验、体会和决心。会上，清华大学、中国科学技术大学的代表，介绍了他们实现革命大联合的经过和体会。尚未实现革命大联合的大专院校的代表，表示要向已经实现革命大联合的战友学习，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，迅速实现革命大联合，以实际行动迎接国庆。全市中等学校到今晚为止，已有两百六十多所实现了革命大联合。许多学校的两派革命师生联合后，坐在一起学习、谈心。他们说，过去我们被小资产阶级派性蒙住了眼睛，纠缠在小是小非上，纠缠在“私”字上；毛主席的最新指示擦亮了我们的眼睛，我们坚决用无产阶级党性克服小资产阶级派性，再也不叫这个派那个派，坚决做毛泽东思想革命派。
    工业、交通、邮电、财贸、教育、卫生等一批市属机关，在这两天，也实现了革命的大联合。北京市三十个直属文艺单位，已有二十三个联合起来了。医药卫生系统，已有北京医院、中医医院、口腔医院、儿童医院、妇产医院、朝阳医院、工农兵医院、天坛医院以及卫生部生物制品研究所等六十多个单位实现了革命大联合。北京市新闻出版系统各单位，今天已全部联合起来。
