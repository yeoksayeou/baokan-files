The Royal Government of Cambodia recently issued a statement severely condemning the malicious slander of the U.S. propaganda machine against Cambodia and exposing the evil plot of U.S. imperialism to expand its war of aggression into Cambodia. The Chinese people firmly support the just stand of the Cambodian government.

U.S. imperialism has always been an enemy of the Cambodian people. For many years, U.S. imperialism has been continuously carrying out military provocations and subversive activities against Cambodia. Recently, the Johnson administration has been madly expanding the war in Vietnam, attempting to set the entire Indochina peninsula ablaze. It has been revealed that the Pentagon has already drawn up plans to invade the northeastern provinces of Cambodia. Currently, U.S. newspapers are spreading lies and slandering Cambodia, preparing public opinion for a large-scale invasion of Cambodia.

In recent times, the Johnson administration has made many "friendly" gestures towards Cambodia. It has pretended to want to hold talks with Cambodia to "improve" bilateral relations and has grandly declared that the U.S. "respects Cambodia's territorial integrity and sovereignty." However, all of this is just deceitful talk, intended to cover up its aggressive plans.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism always lies to your face, writing aggression as 'friendship.'"

Regarding the deceitful words of U.S. imperialism, one must and can only understand them from the opposite perspective. The "friendship" that the Johnson administration speaks of is precisely aggression; its talk of "respecting Cambodia's territorial integrity and sovereignty" is precisely a plan to destroy Cambodia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Talking about "justice and morality," but engaging in aggression and sabotage—this has always been the ugly nature of U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world. It is absolutely impossible for it to establish any "friendship" with the people of various countries. U.S. imperialism, for the sake of monopoly capital interests, must engage in external aggression and plunder. Its contradictions with the people of various countries are irreconcilable. The people of various countries, in order to strive for and maintain national independence and state sovereignty, must resolutely struggle against U.S. imperialism and must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about it. The Cambodian people's struggle against U.S. imperialism over the past few years has proven this point.

The Chinese people have always supported the Cambodian people's just struggle to maintain national independence and oppose U.S. imperialism. The deep friendship between our two peoples, forged in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, has stood the test of time. If U.S. imperialism dares to expand its war of aggression into Cambodia, the 700 million Chinese people will unshakably stand on the side of the Cambodian people and resolutely support them in smashing the U.S. imperialists' aggression!

　　美帝是柬埔寨人民的死敌
　　本报评论员
    柬埔寨王国政府最近发表声明，严厉谴责美国宣传机器对柬埔寨的恶毒诬蔑，揭露美帝国主义准备把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨的罪恶阴谋。中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨政府的严正立场。
    美帝国主义一贯与柬埔寨人民为敌。多年来，美帝国主义不断对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅和颠覆破坏活动。最近，约翰逊政府疯狂扩大侵越战争，企图把战火烧到整个印度支那。据揭露，五角大楼早已制订了占领柬埔寨东北省份的侵略计划。目前美国报刊大造谣言，对柬埔寨进行诬蔑和攻击，正是为对柬埔寨发动大规模侵略行动作舆论准备。
    最近以来，约翰逊政府对柬埔寨作了不少“友好”姿态。它装模作样地表示要同柬埔寨举行会谈来“改善”两国关系，冠冕堂皇地声明美国“尊重柬埔寨的领土完整和主权”。但是，这些统统都是骗人的鬼话，是掩盖其侵略阴谋的烟幕弹。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：美帝国主义总是“当面撒谎，将侵略写成了‘友谊’”。
    对于美帝国主义的花言巧语，必须而且只能从它的反面去理解。约翰逊政府所说的“友好”，恰恰就是侵略；它所说的“尊重柬埔寨领土完整和主权”，恰恰就是要破坏柬埔寨领土完整和主权。说的是“仁义道德”，干的是侵略和破坏，这从来都是美帝国主义的丑恶本性。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，它同世界各国人民是绝对不可能建立什么“友谊”的。美帝国主义为了垄断资本的利益，必然要对外侵略和掠夺。它和世界各国人民的矛盾是不可调和的。各国人民要争取和维护民族独立和国家主权，就必须同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，绝不能对它抱任何不切实际的幻想。柬埔寨人民几年来同美帝国主义进行斗争的实践，就证明了这一点。
    中国人民一贯支持柬埔寨人民维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。我们两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的深厚友谊，是经过时间的考验的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨，七亿中国人民将坚定不移地站在柬埔寨人民一边，坚决支持他们粉碎美帝国主义的侵略！
