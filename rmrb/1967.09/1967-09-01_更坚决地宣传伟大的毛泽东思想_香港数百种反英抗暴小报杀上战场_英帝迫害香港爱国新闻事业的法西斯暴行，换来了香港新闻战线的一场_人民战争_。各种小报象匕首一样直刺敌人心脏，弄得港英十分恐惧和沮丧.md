More Resolutely Promote the Great Thought of Mao Zedong

Hong Kong: Hundreds of Anti-British, Anti-Violence Small Newspapers Enter the Battlefield

The British Empire's fascist atrocities against Hong Kong's patriotic press have sparked a "people's war" on the Hong Kong news front. Various small newspapers are like daggers piercing the enemy's heart, making the British authorities in Hong Kong extremely frightened and disheartened.

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, August 31st – According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers: After the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong illegally forced the patriotic newspapers "Hong Kong Evening News," "New Midday News," and "Tianfeng Daily" to cease publication, patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have risen up to establish anti-British, anti-violence struggle small newspapers, which have developed rapidly like bamboo shoots after a rain. Currently, there are already more than 230 such small newspapers.

The British imperialists in Hong Kong are afraid of the patriotic newspapers promoting the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the surging anti-violence struggle of the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. They have adopted fascist methods to brutally suppress the patriotic press. However, the enemy's oppression has sparked a "people's war" on the news front. Hundreds of anti-British, anti-violence struggle small newspapers have engaged in a head-on struggle with the enemy. As recently published small newspaper "Masses News" stated in its inaugural editorial: "The British plots will not succeed. Closing three newspapers will result in patriotic compatriots publishing 300, 3,000, or even 30,000 patriotic publications, further promoting the great thought of Mao Zedong and more resolutely exposing the British atrocities."

The newly published small newspaper "Dagger" states: "Though small, the dagger can pierce through the British imperialists' masks of 'freedom,' 'democracy,' 'equality,' 'rule of law,' and expose their century-long evil rule to the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. Though small, the dagger can tear off the masks of the traitors and let our compatriots see their true faces. It can also pierce their chests, revealing their black hearts. Though small, the dagger is suitable for close combat and night battles, directly striking the British heart, sending them to their 'heavenly' end."

The newly published small newspaper "Thousand-Jin Stick" compiled the names of recently published small newspapers into a poem: "East wind, angry waves, snowflakes fill the sky; anti-British, anti-violence, thunderous storm. Advance, battle, new march; Hong Kong and Kowloon, masses, resist the enemy. Destroy the British, vanguard, women's militia; rebel, vanguard, Red Guards. Brave warriors, crouching tigers, Tuen Mun; level the British, expel the empire, assault team. Struggle, red, new Hong Kong; red sun, rising, red waves across the river. Sparks, wildfire, change the sky; dawn, first light, East is red."

The anti-British, anti-violence struggle small newspapers published by the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic compatriots have clear stances, diverse forms, and sharp, bold language. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people have boundless creativity." These small newspapers fully embody the wisdom of the masses and have become a powerful weapon in the struggle against British imperialism. These small newspapers, based on the needs of the struggle, expose the fascist face of the British, reveal the plots and tricks of the British authorities, and refute the fallacies of reactionary newspapers. These small newspapers prominently promote Mao Zedong Thought, regarding the defense of Mao Zedong Thought and the promotion of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle as the most glorious and proud task. The commentaries in these small newspapers are profound yet easy to understand, providing rich guidance for the anti-British, anti-violence struggle and achieving broader propaganda effects. These small newspapers are warmly welcomed and supported by the broad patriotic compatriots. Currently, the wave of establishing small newspapers in the Hong Kong and Kowloon regions is surging, making the British fascist authorities extremely frightened and disheartened.

　　更坚决地宣传伟大的毛泽东思想
　　香港数百种反英抗暴小报杀上战场
    英帝迫害香港爱国新闻事业的法西斯暴行，换来了香港新闻战线的一场“人民战争”。各种小报象匕首一样直刺敌人心脏，弄得港英十分恐惧和沮丧
    新华社香港三十一日电　据香港报纸报道：在港英法西斯当局悍然非法强迫《香港夜报》、《新午报》、《田丰日报》三家爱国报纸停刊以后，香港爱国同胞奋起创办的反英抗暴斗争小报象雨后春笋一样迅猛地发展起来，目前这种小报已经有二百三十多种。
    港英帝国主义害怕爱国报纸宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，害怕宣传港九同胞风起云涌的抗暴斗争，竟采取法西斯手段疯狂迫害爱国新闻事业。可是，敌人的压迫，却换来了新闻战线上的一场“人民战争”，数百种反英抗暴斗争的小报，与敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争。正如最近创刊的小报《大众报》在创刊词中所说的：“港英的阴谋休想得逞，封三家报纸，爱国同胞就出三百种、三千种、三万种爱国刊物，更大力地宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，更坚决地揭露港英的暴行。”
    新创刊的《匕首》小报说：“匕首虽小，可戳穿英帝国主义的‘自由’、‘民主’、‘平等’、‘法治’……等假面具，把它百年来罪恶的统治暴露在港九同胞面前。匕首虽小，可划破民族败类走狗的画皮，让我同胞看清走狗的嘴脸，还可刺破走狗的胸膛，让大家看到它的黑心肝。匕首虽小，正适合近战、夜战，可直插港英心脏，叫它魂归‘天国’。”
    新创刊的《千钧棒》小报，把新近出版的小报的报名集成一首诗歌：“东风，怒潮，漫天雪；反英，抗暴，风雷激。进军，战斗，新挺进；港九，群众，抗顽敌。灭英，尖兵，娘子军；造反，先锋，红卫兵。闯将，伏虎，文锦渡；平英，驱帝，突击队。奋斗，红色，新香港；红日，东升，满江红。星火，燎原，换新天；黎明，曙光，东方红。”
    港九爱国同胞出版的反英抗暴斗争小报，立场鲜明，形式多样，文字尖锐泼辣。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”这些小报就是充分发扬了群众的智慧，成了同港英帝国主义展开斗争的一种极为有力的武器。这些小报根据斗争的需要，揭露港英的法西斯面目，戳穿港英当局的阴谋诡计，并针对反动报纸的谬论加以驳斥。这些小报集中突出地宣传毛泽东思想，它们把誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，把在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的宣传，作为最光荣、最自豪的任务。小报的评论，深入浅出，对反英抗暴斗争富有指导意义，收到了更广泛的宣传效果。这些小报受到广大爱国同胞的热烈欢迎和支持。目前，港九地区创办小报的高潮正在方兴未艾，港英法西斯当局对此十分恐惧和沮丧。
