Workers in Shanghai's Zhabei District Eliminate Factionalism and Form a Unified Organization

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, and do a good job of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit.

*Editor's Note: Good news of revolutionary unity on the industrial and transportation fronts in Shanghai is coming in frequently. The Shanghai proletariat, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, is indeed a model of revolutionary unity and a model of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.*

Workers have no fundamental conflicts of interest among themselves. Before liberation, they were all exploited and oppressed, had a common enemy, and had a common revolutionary goal. Currently, the common revolutionary goal is to thoroughly smash the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with the Chinese Khrushchev at the helm, and to completely expose and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly and cleanly uprooting the roots of revisionism. Therefore, unity is the only way, and splittism must be opposed.

Then, why do some factory revolutionary mass organizations have endless "internal wars" and disputes? The reasons are mainly threefold: First, it is due to the instigation of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the lingering influence of the bourgeois reactionary line. They are fanning the flames and stirring up trouble, provoking "internal wars," creating splits, and attempting to fish in troubled waters for their own gain. Second, some mass organizations have a few bad leaders who stir up trouble, deceive the masses, and achieve their ulterior motives. Third, some mass organizations are influenced by extreme right-wing or extreme "left-wing" reactionary trends in society, with anarchism and sectarianism at work, and are blinded by selfishness. Workers say: "'Internal war' is actually 'private war'!" How profound these words are!

Having found the causes of "internal wars," we should treat the symptoms with the right medicine. The experiences of many advanced units have proven that the fundamental solution is to study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, carry out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, eliminate the lingering influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly expose and counter the sabotage plots of class enemies; replace the "self" in our minds with "public." In this way, the differences among revolutionary masses will definitely be eliminated, and revolutionary great unity will definitely be achieved.

Let us welcome the 18th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China with new contributions from revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity!

*Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 13th: According to today's report by Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, at this crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Zhabei District Command and the Zhabei District Branch of the Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, under the guidance of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, have eliminated small factions, swept away selfishness, and finally achieved revolutionary great unity, establishing a unified organizational structure—the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Zhabei Liaison Station.*

The Zhabei District Command and the Zhabei District Branch were both revolutionary mass organizations that emerged under the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line at almost the same time last year. In the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, they had once fought side by side. However, with the change in the status of the proletarian revolutionaries, petty-bourgeois ideology has grown in some individuals, with "self" at the forefront, only seeing their own small factions, often unable to correctly handle some specific problems in the grassroots organizations, and even starting "internal wars."

Later, these two revolutionary mass organizations studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the "June 2" resolution of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, as well as the reports by Comrades Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, raising their ideological understanding and having the desire to achieve revolutionary great unity. However, because selfishness had not been truly overcome, they could not continue when they encountered specific problems. They had talked nearly ten times without significant progress. After the Central Headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued a new battle order, they decided to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With the help of the Zhabei District Military Sub-district and the Workers' General Headquarters, they held a three-day study session on the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the important instructions given by the central leaders at the expanded meeting of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee on September 1st. In the study and discussion, everyone exposed their thoughts and conducted serious self-criticism; they also recalled the process of emerging from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They said: At that time, under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, how eagerly we longed to hear Chairman Mao's voice! It was Chairman Mao who supported us in rebelling against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Thinking back, we two brother organizations had only one wish: to follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. However, Chairman Mao has issued the great call for proletarian revolutionaries to achieve revolutionary great unity for several months now, why can't we two organizations unite? Is there any irreconcilable conflict of interests between us? No, there is no irreconcilable conflict of interests among us workers, our fundamental interests are the same. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Today, we are for a common revolutionary goal, swearing to smash the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. What reason do we have not to unite?

Responding resolutely to the battle order issued by Chairman Mao's headquarters! The Zhabei District Command and the Zhabei District Branch of the Workers' General Headquarters finally achieved revolutionary great unity. Yesterday, a grand meeting was held to celebrate the establishment of the Zhabei Liaison Station of the Workers' General Headquarters. Leaders from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the Workers' General Headquarters attended to express their warm congratulations.

    实现共同的革命目标　反对分裂主义
    上海闸北区工人铲除山头成立统一组织
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫，搞好本单位的斗批改
    《文汇报》编者按：上海工业交通战线上革命大联合的喜报频传。具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级不愧为革命大联合的模范，不愧为紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的模范。
    工人与工人之间没有根本利益的矛盾，解放前都是被剥削、被压迫者，有共同的敌人，有共同的革命目标。当前，共同的革命目标就是彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批臭、批倒，彻底、干净地挖掉修正主义根子。因此，只能联合，不能分裂。
    那末，有些工厂的革命群众组织之间为什么有打不停的“内战”，闹不完的纠纷呢？究其原因，不外乎三个方面：一是由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑拨，由于资产阶级反动路线的流毒，是他们在那里煽阴风，点鬼火，挑动“内战”，制造分裂，妄图混水摸鱼，从中得利。二是有的群众组织中混进了少数坏头头，他们兴风作浪，蒙骗群众，以达到其不可告人的目的。三是一些群众组织受到社会上极右或极“左”的反动思潮的影响，无政府主义、宗派主义作怪，被“私”字迷了心窍。工人们说：“‘内战’其实就是‘私战’”！这话说得何等深刻啊！
    找到了“内战”的原因，我们就应对症下药。许多先进单位的经验证明，最根本的办法就是学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，进行革命大批判，肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，同时，对阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，坚决给予揭露、还击；把自己头脑里的“私”字换上一个“公”字。这样，革命群众之间的分歧一定能够消除，革命的大联合一定能实现。
    让我们用革命大批判和革命大联合的新贡献，来迎接伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年吧！
    新华社上海十三日电　据上海《文汇报》今天报道：正当无产阶级文化大革命处在极其重要的关键时刻，上海工总司闸北区司令部和闸北区分部的无产阶级革命派，通过活学活用毛主席著作，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，铲除了小山头，横扫了“私”字，终于实现了革命的大联合，成立了一个统一的组织机构——上海工人革命造反总司令部闸北联络站。
    闸北区司令部和闸北区分部，差不多在去年同一个时刻，都是在资产阶级反动路线迫害下“杀”出来的革命群众组织。在和资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，也曾经并肩战斗。但是，随着无产阶级革命派的地位的变化，在个别同志身上，小资产阶级的思想有所滋长，“我”字当头，只看到自己的小山头，往往对基层组织中的一些具体问题，不能正确加以处理，甚至因而打起“内战”来。
    后来，这两个革命群众组织学习了毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和上海市革命委员会“六·二”决议，以及张春桥、姚文元同志的报告，思想认识有了提高，有了实现革命大联合的愿望。但由于“私”字并没有真正克服，一遇到具体问题便谈不下去。前后谈了近十次，没有显著的进展。以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出了新的战斗号令后，他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。在中国人民解放军闸北区武装部和工总司的帮助下，他们进行了三天的活学活用毛主席著作的学习会，学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和九月一日中央首长在北京市革命委员会扩大会议上的重要指示。在学习讨论中，大家都亮出了自己的思想，进行了认真的自我批评；还回忆了当时从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下“杀”出来的经过。他们说：当时在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，多么渴望听到毛主席的声音啊！是毛主席支持我们造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。想当初我们两个兄弟组织，只有一个心愿：要紧跟毛主席干革命。但是，毛主席发出无产阶级革命派要实现革命的大联合的伟大号召已有好几个月了，我们两个组织为什么至今还联合不起来呢？难道我们之间有什么不可调和的利害冲突吗？不，我们工人之间决没有什么不可调和的利害冲突，我们的根本利益是一致的。毛主席教导我们：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”今天，我们就是为了一个共同的革命目标，誓把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部彻底摧毁。我们还有什么理由不联合起来呢？
    坚决响应毛主席的司令部发出的战斗号令！工总司闸北区司令部和闸北区分部终于实现了革命的大联合。昨天隆重举行集会，欢庆工总司闸北联络站的成立。上海市革命委员会和工总司的负责人到会表示热烈祝贺。
