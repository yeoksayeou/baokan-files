The major political task facing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at present is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. To ensure the victory of this political task, the most crucial issue is to achieve great revolutionary unity.

Only by implementing great revolutionary unity can we mobilize tens of millions of people, form a vast army, and to the greatest extent isolate the class enemies, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

The proletariat is the most advanced and revolutionary class. The proletariat should be the model for revolutionary criticism and the model for revolutionary unity. We have thousands of reasons, tens of thousands of reasons, to unite and fight together against the enemy, and not a single reason, not half a reason, to cause splits and wage "internal wars," dividing into two irreconcilable factions.

The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will not readily accept their defeat and will always look for opportunities to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These class enemies are most pleased when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are engaged in endless "internal wars" and cannot attend to other matters. They sharpen their wits and wide open their thieving eyes, specifically looking for cracks within our revolutionary ranks. Even if there are minor disagreements or slight fissures, they will seize the opportunity, using various cunning and vicious methods to sow discord, create splits, and sabotage revolutionary unity.

Revolutionary criticism is the driving force behind revolutionary unity. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat must, through revolutionary criticism, overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, reform their worldview, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution, continuously expanding and consolidating revolutionary unity.

Comrades of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite in battle, and battle united!

　　在战斗中联合，联合起来战斗
    当前，摆在无产阶级革命派面前的重大政治任务，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改。要保证这项政治任务的胜利完成，最关键的问题是实现革命的大联合。
    只有实行革命的大联合，才能调动千千万万的群众，组成浩浩荡荡的大军，最大限度地孤立阶级敌人，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭。
    无产阶级是最先进、最革命的阶级。无产阶级应该成为革命大批判的模范，成为革命大联合的模范。我们有千条理由、万条理由，团结战斗，共同对敌，而没有一条理由、半条理由，闹分裂，打“内战”，分成势不两立的两大派组织。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮地富反坏右，决不甘心于他们的失败，总是寻机破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这些阶级敌人，最高兴无产阶级革命派内部“内战”不休，自顾不暇。他们削尖了脑袋，睁大了贼眼，专找我们革命队伍内部的缝隙。那怕你有很小的分歧，一点点裂痕，他们也会钻进去，采取各种阴险毒辣的手段，挑拨离间，制造分裂，破坏革命的大联合。
    革命的大批判，是革命大联合的动力。无产阶级革命派都要在革命的大批判中，破“私”立“公”，改造世界观，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，不断扩大和巩固革命的大联合。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在战斗中联合，联合起来战斗！　　　（《大众日报》九月十八日社论）
