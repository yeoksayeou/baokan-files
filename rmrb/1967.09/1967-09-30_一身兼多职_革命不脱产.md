One person, multiple roles, revolution without leaving work. This is the battle cry of the members of the "Defend Mao Zedong Thought Rebel Corps" at the Tianjin Thrift Hat Factory. They focus on production during work hours and engage in revolution after work, making their schedules very tight. Someone suggested setting up a full-time staff member to handle reception and printing of leaflets. The leaders of the Rebel Corps organized a study session on Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." They also told the members: Chairman Mao calls on us to save on revolution, and saving manpower is the greatest savings. After the study session, everyone's awareness was raised. The members all insisted on engaging in revolution in their spare time, and willingly took on more work. Sometimes, marches took up work time, but they would voluntarily make up for it. The leaders of the Rebel Corps were even more exemplary. One core member, who works as an accountant in the factory, in addition to his business duties, also voluntarily took on more revolutionary responsibilities, writing materials, printing leaflets, managing the wall newspaper, and handling broadcasts, always ready to take on any task, busy from morning till night. Another leader, in addition to his shift work, also conducted investigations, received visitors, organized study sessions, and was a supervisor in production. Everyone called them "multi-tasking workers."

    一身兼多职　革命不脱产
    “一人兼多职，革命不脱产”，这是天津市勤俭制帽厂捍卫毛泽东思想造反队队员们的战斗口号。他们上班抓生产，下班搞革命，很紧张。有人提议搞个脱产人员，做做接待，印印传单。造反队的负责人就组织大家学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，并且向队员们说：毛主席号召我们节约闹革命，节约人力是最大的节约。经过学习，大家认识提高，队员们个个都坚持业余搞革命，心情舒畅地主动多承担工作，有时游行占了工作时间，也主动补上。造反队的负责人更是事事带头。有个核心成员在厂里担任会计，除了业务工作外，还主动多挑革命重担，写材料，印传单，办墙报，搞广播，见工作就干，一天到晚也不闲。另一个负责人，除顶班劳动外，还搞调查，接待，组织学习，在生产上还是个监督员。大家都称他们是“一身多职的勤务员”。
