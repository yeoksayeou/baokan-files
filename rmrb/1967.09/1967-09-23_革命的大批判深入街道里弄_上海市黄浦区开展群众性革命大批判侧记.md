Recently, the standing committee of the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee in Shanghai has held large criticism meetings with the revolutionary masses for the fourth time. After studying Chairman Mao's works and the instructions of central leaders, the standing committee of the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee realized that among all tasks, conducting revolutionary criticism is the most important. A revolutionary cadre who only educates others but not himself, who only calls on others but does not act himself, cannot lead the great revolutionary criticism. Leading by example in learning and criticizing is an important condition for mobilizing the masses to further carry out revolutionary criticism. Therefore, they decided to go among the masses, participate in the criticism with the masses, and learn from the masses in the criticism to promote the revolutionization of the leadership core.

Silent Command

In a recent criticism meeting, they focused on criticizing the reactionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev advocating the parliamentary path and opposing armed struggle. In this meeting, they used Chairman Mao's teachings and their own experiences to denounce China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies. Everyone said that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek was eager to seize the fruits of the anti-Japanese victory and launched a civil war. To defend the victory, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed the policy of "fighting back inch by inch, not giving up an inch of land." Chairman Mao said, "The people's weapons, every gun and every bullet, must be preserved and not handed over." At this critical moment, China's Khrushchev openly opposed Chairman Mao, saying that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful parliamentary struggle" and proposed to hand over the people's weapons to the Kuomintang for "reorganization." Chiang Kai-shek was sharpening his knives, but he advocated handing over the people's weapons. Chiang Kai-shek was mobilizing troops in large numbers to prepare for a civil war of massacring the people, but he advocated handing over the people's weapons. China's Khrushchev thus blatantly curried favor with the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, fully exposing his traitorous face. The responsible comrade of the district military department said at the criticism meeting, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' Countless facts in history prove that parliamentary struggle is just a lie to deceive people. The gun is the lifeline of the proletarian revolutionary faction. We must firmly grasp the revolutionary gun and resolutely respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to 'support the army and love the people,' unite with the revolutionary faction heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Everyone felt that such a criticism meeting was very educational and fruitful. They said, "By conducting revolutionary criticism, the red line and black line are clearly distinguished, and the power is guaranteed to be used correctly." Some masses said, "The leadership taking the lead in criticism is a good start and sets a good example for us. This is a silent command, a powerful mobilization." The leadership took the lead, and the masses had the spirit. The masses took further action, and the revolutionary criticism was more widely and deeply carried out throughout the district.

Unrest in the Alleys

To the north of the high-rise buildings on Nanjing Road is the alleyways of the Gaoling Road area. In these relatively quiet alleyways, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses actively participated in the revolutionary criticism movement. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and, based on the living facts in the alleyways, verbally and in writing, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's vigorous promotion of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

China's Khrushchev fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, replacing heaven and earth, spreading the reactionary fallacy that "the question of who wins between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved," which aroused the extreme indignation of the revolutionary masses in the Gaoling Road area. Many retired workers, staff family members, and revolutionary masses used their personal experiences and observations in the alleyways to powerfully criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies. They exposed the reactionary remarks made by some ghosts and snakes in society during the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses and Red Guards in this area recently also exposed an old counter-revolutionary who had been hiding for nearly eighteen years. He had participated in Chiang Kai-shek's personally planned "April 12" counter-revolutionary massacre and the "May 30th" massacre in 1927, and his home still had accounts of changing the sky and murder weapons. Many retired workers said at the criticism meeting: These class enemies hide guns, bullets, murder knives, and accounts of changing the sky, which proves that these guys are still here, their hearts are not dead, and they will use their weapons to kill our comrades as soon as they have the opportunity. China's Khrushchev spreads the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," which is in cahoots with these ghosts and snakes, attempting to restore capitalism.

Through the revolutionary criticism, many alleyway revolutionary masses clearly saw that the alleyways are the battlefield of class struggle and the battlefield of criticism. Some staff family members said, "In the past, we only paid attention to children, baskets, and stoves, and did not notice that class enemies were sleeping next to us. In the future, we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and never forget class struggle."

Exhibition—Criticism Meeting

China's Khrushchev said, "Workers welcome capitalist exploitation, 'no exploitation, no food,'" which is the voice of vampires. The revolutionary masses of Huangpu District were furious upon hearing this and vowed to settle this account!

Recently, the proletarian revolutionary factions of five department stores, including Wuzhou and Jinqiao on Nanjing Road, held a small-scale exhibition during the wave of criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, linking it with examples from their own units, and severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "exploitation is meritorious" theory. Here, there are the capitalists' accounts of changing the sky and the gold-plated signs they carefully collected, dreaming of changing the sky; here, there are large amounts of gold, batches of watches, and large quantities of goods hoarded by the capitalists. There is also the history of the capitalists' exploitation of workers. However, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai went all out to praise these capitalists as "advanced producers" and awarded them "gold medals," which is how despicable and shameful!

China's Khrushchev said, "Today's capitalist exploitation is not only not a sin but also a merit." The exhibition had a book of workers' blood and tears, which exposed this counter-revolutionary's fallacy. An old worker from Wuzhou Department Store is over fifty years old, but she still does not know who her parents are. She was sold four times and suffered endless torment, giving birth to seven children but losing six. This was all caused by the capitalists' ruthless exploitation, which is the "merit" of capitalist exploitation!

China's Khrushchev also said, "Exploitation by someone is better than no exploitation, and without exploitation, workers will be unemployed." The examples exhibited at the exhibition strongly refuted this fallacy. An elderly worker surnamed Yao was forced to live in poverty by the capitalists' ruthless exploitation, and his mother and wife died of illness without money for treatment. A young worker had been an apprentice for six years, but the capitalist did not allow him to graduate, extending the time of extortion and exploitation as much as possible. These living facts gave China's Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face.

Many elderly workers, after seeing the exhibition, recalled the past and could not help but shed tears. Thinking of China's Khrushchev's ugly face, their class hatred became even stronger. They said: To avoid suffering again, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the direction of the struggle, and thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev. Some young workers said, "We grew up in the era of Mao Zedong and have never been exploited by capitalists. After seeing the exhibition, we further saw through the heavy crimes of China's Khrushchev. He dreams of restoring capitalism, which is absolutely impossible! We must criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents thoroughly."

### 革命的大批判深入街道里弄——上海市黄浦区开展群众性革命大批判侧记

　　革命的大批判深入街道里弄
　　——上海市黄浦区开展群众性革命大批判侧记
    最近，上海市黄浦区革命委员会的常委，已经第四次同革命群众在一起开大批判会了。黄浦区革委会的常委通过学习毛主席著作和中央负责同志的指示后，体会到，千件事，万件事，抓好革命大批判是最重要的事。一个革命领导干部，光教育别人，不教育自己，光号召别人，自己没有行动，是不能领导好具有伟大意义的革命大批判的。领导带头学习，带头批判，以身作则，是发动群众进一步开展革命大批判的重要条件。因此，他们决定到群众中去，与群众一起参加批判，在大批判中向群众学习，促进领导核心的思想革命化。
    无声的号令
    在最近的一次批判会上，他们着重批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹议会道路、反对武装斗争的反动谬论。在这次批判会上，他们以毛主席的教导和本身体会，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论。大家说，抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石一心抢夺抗日的胜利果实，发动内战。为了保卫胜利果实，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出了“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针。毛主席说：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”就在这关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫公然跳出来与毛主席相对抗，胡说什么“中国革命主要斗争形式已变为和平的议会的”，并提出要把人民的武装交给国民党“整编”。蒋介石在磨刀霍霍，而他却鼓吹什么“和平”呀，“议会”呀！蒋介石正在大量调兵遣将准备发动残杀人民的内战，他却主张把人民的武装交出去。中国赫鲁晓夫这样赤裸裸地讨好美蒋反动派，完全暴露了他的叛徒嘴脸。参加批判会的区武装部的负责同志说，毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”，古今中外无数事实证明，什么议会斗争，不过是一句骗人的鬼话，枪杆子是我们无产阶级革命派的命根子，我们一定要牢牢掌握革命的枪杆子，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的号召，与革命派心连心、肩并肩，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    大家感到这样的批判会很受教育，很有收获，他们说：“抓好革命大批判，红线黑线分得清，掌权用权有保证。”有些群众说：“领导带头批判，这是一个很好的开端，给我们作出了好榜样。这是无声的号令，是有力的动员。”领导带了头，群众有劲头。群众进一步行动起来了，革命大批判更广泛深入地在全区开展起来了。
　　不平静的里弄
    在南京路高楼大厦的北面，是牯岭路地区的街道，这里是一条条深深的里弄。就在这些比较安静的里弄中，成千上万的革命群众，积极投入了革命大批判运动。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，以街道上发生的活生生事实，口诛笔伐，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫极力宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，疯狂地反对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，偷天换日，散布什么“无产阶级和资产阶级谁胜谁负的问题已经解决了”的反动谬论，激起了牯岭路地区里弄革命群众无比愤恨。许多退休老工人、职工家属、革命群众，都以他们在里弄里的亲身经历和见闻，有力地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论。他们揭出了社会上一些牛鬼蛇神在文化大革命中散布的反动言论。这个地区的革命群众和红卫兵小将，最近还揭发出一个隐藏近十八年之久的老反革命，他曾经参与了蒋介石在一九二七年亲手策划的“四·一二”反革命大屠杀和“五卅”惨案，家里还收藏着变天账和杀人武器。不少退休老工人在批判会上说：这些阶级敌人藏着手枪、子弹、杀人刀、变天账，这就证明这些家伙人还在，心不死，一有机会，就要用他们的武器来杀我们的同志。中国赫鲁晓夫散布“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就是和这些牛鬼蛇神穿一条裤子，企图复辟资本主义。
    通过革命大批判，许多里弄革命群众清楚地看到：街道里弄是阶级斗争的阵地，是大批判的战场。有的职工家属说：“过去我们只注意孩子、篮子、炉子，阶级敌人就睡在我们的身边也没觉察到，今后我们一定要提高革命警惕，念念不忘阶级斗争。”
　　展览会——批判会
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“工人欢迎资本家剥削”，“不剥削就没有饭吃”，这完全是吸血鬼的声音，黄浦区的革命群众听后怒火万丈，这笔账一定要清算的！
    最近，南京路上的五洲、金桥等五家百货商店的无产阶级革命派，在大批判的热潮中，举办了一个小型展览会，以毛泽东思想为武器，联系发生在本单位的事例，狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”论。这里，有资本家的变天账，以及他们精心收藏梦想变天的金字招牌；这里，有资本家收藏的大量黄金、大批手表，囤积的大批商品。还有资本家剥削工人的发家史。可是，对这些罪恶累累的资本家，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，却极力把他们捧为“先进生产者”，奉上“金色奖章”，这是何等的卑鄙可耻啊！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫说什么“今天资本主义的剥削，不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”。展览会上，有一本工人的血泪账，就把这个反革命分子的谬论戳穿了。五洲百货商店一个老工人，今年五十多岁了，但到现在不知自己父母是谁，她先后被卖过四次，受尽折磨，曾生过七个孩子，却死了六个。这都是资本家残酷剥削她所造成的，这就是资本家的“剥削功劳”！
    中国赫鲁晓夫还胡说“有人剥削比没有人剥削好，没有人剥削工人就会失业”，展览会上展出的事例，有力地驳斥了这种谬论。一个姓姚的老年职工，就是因资本家的残酷剥削，母亲、妻子生活维持不了，生病无钱医治而死。一个青年工人已做了六年徒工，资本家也不让他出师，把敲诈剥削他的时间尽量拉长。这些活生生的事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫一记记响亮的耳光。
    不少老年职工看了展览后，忆起往事，禁不住热泪盈眶。想起中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶嘴脸，阶级仇恨更加强烈。他们说：为了不再受二遍苦，我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握斗争大方向，把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭。有的青年职工说：“我们生长在毛泽东时代，没有受过资本家的剥削。看了展览以后，我们进一步看清了中国的赫鲁晓夫的深重罪恶，他梦想复辟资本主义，这绝对办不到！我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人都批倒批臭。”
