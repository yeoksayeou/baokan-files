Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we will be close with them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight them. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is so audacious and shameless, attacking our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and opposing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is like a mantis blocking a chariot, a dead end!

This truth, that truth, every word of Chairman Mao is the truth; this power, that power, Mao Zedong Thought has the greatest power. The great changes in Dazhai over the past twenty years since liberation are the most powerful evidence. Let's not talk about other things, just take a look at our several major anti-disaster struggles under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In August 1963, Dazhai suffered a historical flood disaster that had never been seen before. The hills slipped, the land was washed away, houses collapsed, caves caved in, and roads were cut off. At that time, the landlords and rich peasants in our village were gleeful at the disaster, spreading rumors and causing trouble, saying, "Even in a hundred years, Dazhai's production will not recover." But we poor and lower-middle peasants remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results." After the disaster, everyone followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "self-reliance," relying on our iron hands and iron shoulders to rebuild the land, build houses, and construct caves. During the anti-disaster struggle, we never left Chairman Mao's books, learning and applying them simultaneously, using them and learning from them, with immediate results. The villagers said, "The more we study Chairman Mao's books, the more enthusiasm we have, the more methods we find." Indeed, spirit turns into material, and by 1964, we had basically overcome the disaster and achieved a record-breaking harvest. Last year, Dazhai experienced five disasters: water, drought, wind, hail, and pests, especially the flood, which was more severe than in 1963. But the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were steadfast in the face of difficulties, with hearts harder than iron and wills firmer than steel. Everyone said, "No matter how big the flood is, it can only wash away the embankments and land, but it cannot wash away Mao Zedong Thought from our minds." We took Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as our motto, everyone learned and applied them, taking Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and Old Yu Gong as examples, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue nor death, wholeheartedly for the collective and for the revolution, and finally achieved a great victory in the anti-disaster struggle, obtaining a bumper harvest. After several years of hard struggle, Dazhai has transformed from a poor mountain valley of "high mountains and rocky gullies, steep slopes, no flat land for three miles, and frequent disasters every year" into today's "layered terraces and rows of new houses." A new socialist Dazhai has been initially built. Comrades who come to visit Dazhai say: Dazhai changes every day, every month. We say: No matter how much Dazhai changes, ultimately it is the change in people's thoughts, it is the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai who love to read Chairman Mao's books, reading them every day and applying them every day, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, changing worldviews, realizing the revolutionization of thoughts, and promoting the great development of production.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party crazily opposes Mao Zedong Thought, maliciously cursing our workers and peasants learning Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization" and "simplification," fearing that we laboring people will master Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful spiritual atomic bomb, intending to make us follow him and obediently engage in revisionism.

China's Khrushchev, listen to the voice of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai: Chairman Mao's books are the treasure among treasures, we cannot live without them for a lifetime, we will pass them down from generation to generation, forever and ever. Chairman Mao's books guide the proletariat and laboring people in seizing and defending the power, we will read them for a thousand years, ten thousand years, forever!

　　谁反对毛主席我们就和他拚
　　梁便良　郭凤莲
    谁拥护毛主席，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟胆大包天，肆无忌惮地攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这是螳螂挡车，死路一条！
    这真理，那真理，毛主席的话句句是真理；这威力大，那威力大，毛泽东思想的威力最大。我们大寨解放后二十多年的巨大变化就是最有力的铁证。别的不说，就说说我们在毛泽东思想指导下的几次大的抗灾斗争吧。一九六三年八月，大寨遭到了历史上从没有过的洪水灾害，山溜了，地冲了，房倒了，窑塌了，路断了。那时，我们村里的地主、富农分子幸灾乐祸，造谣破坏，说什么“再有一百年，大寨的生产也恢复不了。”可是我们贫下中农牢记毛主席的一句话：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果”。灾后，大伙遵照毛主席“自力更生”的伟大教导，凭着我们的铁手、铁肩膀修土地，盖房屋，建窑洞。在抗灾斗争中，我们时刻不离毛主席的书，边学边用，边用边学，百用百灵，立竿见影。社员们说：“毛主席的书，越学干劲越大，越学办法越多。”果然，精神变物质，到一九六四年就基本战胜了灾害，获得了历史上的特大丰收。去年大寨水、旱、风、雹、虫五灾俱全，特别是洪灾，比一九六三年还严重，可是用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨贫下中农，在困难面前，心比铁硬，志比钢坚。大伙说：“洪水再大，只能冲坝、冲地，冲不了我们脑子里的毛泽东思想。”我们以毛主席的“老三篇”为座右铭，人人学，人人用，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，不怕苦，不怕累，不怕死，一心为集体，一心为革命，终于取得了抗灾斗争的伟大胜利，获得了农业大丰收。经过这几年的艰苦奋战，大寨已由过去的“山高石头沟，出门就爬坡，地无三里平，年年灾情多”的穷山沟，变为现在的“层层梯田，排排新屋”。一个社会主义新大寨已经初步建成。来大寨参观的同志们说：大寨是天天变，月月变。我们说：大寨千变万变，归根结底就是人的思想变，就是大寨的贫下中农最爱读毛主席的书，天天读，天天用，破私立公，改造世界观，实现了思想革命化，促进了生产大发展。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，恶毒地咒骂我们工农群众学习毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”，就是害怕我们劳动人民掌握毛泽东思想这个强大的精神原子弹，就是为了让我们跟着他，服服贴贴地去搞修正主义。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，你听听我们大寨贫下中农的声音：毛主席的书是宝中宝，我们一辈子离不了，我们要代代相传，永远不断。毛主席的书指导着无产阶级和劳动人民打江山、保江山，我们要读一千年，一万年，万万年！
