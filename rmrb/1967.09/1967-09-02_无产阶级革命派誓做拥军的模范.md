The proletarian revolutionaries pledge to be exemplary in supporting the army. The people of the entire nation and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are actively responding to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's solemn call to "launch a more extensive and fervent campaign of supporting the army and loving the people," and are formulating new agreements to support the army and love the people based on the specific situations of the proletarian cultural revolution in their respective localities.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Throughout the entire socialist period, there exist classes and class struggle. This class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes even very intense. Our dictatorship tools must not be weakened but should be strengthened." The proletarian cultural revolution in China is a great revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. The People's Liberation Army, as the main pillar of proletarian dictatorship, is the most important guarantee for us to carry out this great struggle and achieve a thorough victory.

The People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is a genuine proletarian army, an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that is closely linked with the people like flesh and blood and fish and water. This army is unparalleled in the world. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries dare not invade us, and the proletarian cultural revolution in our country can proceed smoothly, all because we have the People's Liberation Army as a great wall.

Each revolutionary comrade must have a high sense of enemy awareness, never forgetting the existence of class enemies at home and abroad, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting proletarian dictatorship, and never forgetting the People's Liberation Army that guards our proletarian dictatorship day and night. All proletarian revolutionaries, all Red Guards, all revolutionary masses, and all patriotic people should raise high the banner of supporting the army and loving the people, pledge to be exemplary in supporting the army, and strengthen and develop the combat friendship between the military and the people a thousand times over, cherishing the People's Liberation Army as they would their own eyes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Every comrade should understand that the words and actions of a Communist must take as their highest standard whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by them." Every proletarian revolutionary should understand the bigger picture and consider the overall situation. At all times, they must firmly believe in, rely on, and support the People's Liberation Army. This conviction must not be shaken.

We should fulfill all our responsibilities to support the People's Liberation Army and uphold its sacred authority. Doing so is upholding proletarian dictatorship, upholding the proletarian cultural revolution, and upholding the interests of the country and the people.

Supporting the army and loving the people are inseparable. The People's Liberation Army should enthusiastically support the proletarian revolutionaries, and the proletarian revolutionaries should firmly support the People's Liberation Army. In the process of the army's "three supports and two militaries" work, we proletarian revolutionaries should enthusiastically help the army understand the situation and do a good job, and absolutely not exaggerate the shortcomings in the army's leftist work. At the same time, we should heighten our revolutionary vigilance and smash any plots by class enemies to sabotage military-civilian unity.

Supporting the army and loving the people is a strategic slogan for advancing the proletarian cultural revolution and is the general principle for correctly handling military-civilian relations during the proletarian cultural revolution. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionaries should deeply understand the great significance of supporting the army and loving the people in the new situation of the proletarian cultural revolution, seriously formulate and consciously implement agreements to support the army and love the people, and push the proletarian cultural revolution from victory to new and greater victories!

　　无产阶级革命派誓做拥军的模范
    全国人民和人民解放军全体指战员，正在积极响应毛主席和党中央关于“更大规模地展开热烈的拥军爱民运动”的庄严号召，根据当地无产阶级文化大革命的具体情况，制定新的拥军爱民公约。
    毛主席教导我们：“整个社会主义阶段，存在着阶级和阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的。我们的专政工具不能削弱，还应当加强。”我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的大革命。中国人民解放军作为无产阶级专政的主要支柱，是我们进行这场伟大斗争，并取得彻底胜利的最重要的保证。
    毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导的，林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，是真正的无产阶级的军队，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，是和人民群众血肉相连、鱼水相依的军队。这个军队是举世无双的。帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派不敢侵略我们，我国的无产阶级文化大革命所以能够顺利地进行，就是因为有人民解放军这样一个伟大长城。
    我们每个革命同志都要有高度的敌情观念，千万不要忘记国内外有阶级敌人的存在，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政，千万不要忘记日夜保卫着我国无产阶级专政的人民解放军。一切无产阶级革命派，一切红卫兵革命小将，一切革命群众，一切爱国的人们，都应当高举拥军爱民的旗帜，誓做拥军的模范，千百倍地巩固和发展军民之间的战斗友谊，象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护中国人民解放军。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”每个无产阶级革命派，都应该识大体，顾大局。在任何时候，对人民解放军都要坚决相信，坚决依靠，坚决拥护。这个信念是绝不能动摇的。
    我们应该尽一切责任，拥护人民解放军，维护人民解放军的崇高权威。这样做，就是维护无产阶级专政，就是维护无产阶级文化大革命，就是维护祖国和人民的利益。
    拥军和爱民，是不可分割的关系。人民解放军要热烈地支持无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派要坚决地拥护人民解放军。在解放军进行“三支”“两军”的工作过程中，我们无产阶级革命派要热情地帮助解放军了解情况，做好工作，绝不能把人民解放军支左工作中的缺点加以夸大。同时，要提高革命警惕，粉碎阶级敌人任何形式的破坏军民团结的阴谋。
    拥军爱民，是推进无产阶级文化大革命的战略口号，是正确处理无产阶级文化大革命中军民关系的总原则。人民解放军指战员和无产阶级革命派，都应该深刻理解在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下拥军爱民的伟大意义，认真地制订并自觉地实行拥军爱民公约，把无产阶级文化大革命从胜利推向新的更大的胜利！
