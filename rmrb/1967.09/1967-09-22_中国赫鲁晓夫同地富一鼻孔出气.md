Our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, led the people of the entire nation to overthrow the "three big mountains" that had been weighing us down, and we embarked on the happy path of socialism. We poor and lower-middle peasants have stood up politically and economically, and agricultural production is flourishing like sesame plants growing taller day by day.

However, China's Khrushchev insists on opposing us. He vigorously advocates for "freedom to exploit," "preserving the rich peasant economy," and shouts slogans like "exploitation saves people, prohibiting exploitation is dogmatism," "we should welcome exploitation," and so on. In essence, he wants landlords and rich peasants to have the freedom to exploit us poor and lower-middle peasants, preventing us from standing up and liberating ourselves, and from taking the socialist path.

What kind of vine produces what kind of gourd, what kind of bottle sells what kind of medicine. China's Khrushchev is completely in cahoots with landlords and rich peasants, sitting on the same bench, wearing the same pants, singing the same tune, and walking the same path.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to thoroughly smash China's Khrushchev's evil plot to restore capitalism, and steadfastly follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path.

　　中国赫鲁晓夫同地富一鼻孔出气
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席领导全国人民推翻了压在我们头上的
  “三座大山”，走上了社会主义的幸福大道。我们贫下中农在政治上、经济上翻了身，农业生产也象芝麻开花节节高。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却硬要和我们作对。他拚命提倡什么“剥削自由”呀，“保存富农经济”呀，叫嚷什么“剥削是救人，不准剥削是教条主义”呀，
  “要欢迎剥削”呀，等等。说来说去，就是要让地主、富农有剥削我们贫下中农的自由，不准我们贫下中农翻身解放，走社会主义道路。
    啥个藤结啥瓜，啥个葫芦卖啥个药。中国赫鲁晓夫完全和地主、富农一鼻孔出气，坐一条凳子，穿一条裤子，唱一个调子，走一条路子。
    毛主席早就指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”我们一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，坚定不移地跟毛主席走社会主义道路。
