The struggle over the people's military power is a focal point in the struggle between Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and the capitulationist line of China's Khrushchev.

Mao Zedong scientifically summarized the experiences of domestic and international revolutionary struggles and pointed out with great insight: "Without an army of the people, there can be no victory for the people." Mao Zedong has consistently advocated for "struggling for the military power of the party, struggling for the military power of the people."

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, was determined to seize every inch of power and every bit of gain. On the surface, he spread a smoke screen of peace, but in reality, he was actively preparing for a nationwide civil war. At this critical moment of deciding between two destinies and two futures, Mao Zedong proposed: "Our policy is to meet force with force, to struggle for every inch of ground." On one hand, we do not reject negotiations, using them to expose the deception of the Kuomintang reactionaries, while on the other hand, we prepare to fight to defend the people's victories, firmly relying on the people to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries. Mao Zedong also clearly pointed out: "The people's weapons, every gun, every bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over."

Mao Zedong pointed out sharply: "If there were opportunism at this time, it would be to not struggle, to voluntarily hand over the fruits that the people deserve to Chiang Kai-shek." China's Khrushchev was the biggest opportunist at that time. He spread the capitulationist fallacy of "giving up the military to achieve national progress," openly opposing Mao Zedong's revolutionary line.

In February 1946, China's Khrushchev issued a "Report on the Current Situation." He said: "Our army will become the national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense forces, ... after reorganization, the party will stop directly leading and commanding the military, unified under the Ministry of Defense, ... adopting this form, we have preserved our army. ... Using this concession, we have obtained the legal status of our party, we have obtained the nationalization of the Kuomintang army, we have obtained the Kuomintang army's separation from the party, from individuals, from local cliques, we have obtained national democratization, that is, giving up the military for national progress."

Look, these words fully reveal the ugly face of China's Khrushchev's capitulationism!

"How can the people's army be preserved?" The people's army can be preserved in the hands of the Communist Party and the people, but it cannot be preserved by handing it over to the Kuomintang and the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek. This is absurd! On the Jinggang Mountains, with a population of less than 2,000 and grain production of less than 10,000 piculs, "the enemy surrounds us on all sides, but we stand firm"; the people's army not only survived but also greatly developed. In the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, despite extremely difficult conditions, the people's army could still be preserved and grow stronger. Why, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the people's armed forces were stronger than ever, could they not be preserved and had to be handed over? This fully exposes that China's Khrushchev was intimidated by the aggressive military actions of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries! Handing over the military to Chiang Kai-shek, this army could be "preserved," but it could only be preserved as a tool of the reactionary ruling class, and the people would lose their guns, falling back into the depths of suffering under the oppression of domestic and foreign reactionaries. The fate of Thorez and Togliatti, who handed over their armies, is a testament to this. If we fall for China's Khrushchev's tricks, we will inevitably lead to the same evil outcome.

"Obtaining the legal status of our party." The Communist Party is a revolutionary party.

"Revolution is an uprising, a violent act of one class overthrowing another." This is completely in line with the law of the proletariat and the law of the people, but it will never be allowed by the reactionary rule of the exploiting classes. Under the capitalist system, to be legal means not to revolutionize, and to revolutionize means not to be legal. When the Communist Party of China first stepped onto the political stage, it was "lawless," with a fearless revolutionary spirit, defying the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government, boldly mobilizing the workers and peasants, and launching armed struggles, thus achieving growth and strength. This was the move that Chiang Kai-shek, the reactionary leader of the Kuomintang, hated the most and had no way to deal with. Chiang Kai-shek day and night dreamed of using the trap of "handing over the army for legal status" to lure our party into it, achieving his evil goal of eliminating our party and our army without a fight. China's Khrushchev just happened to spout these dark words, isn't he helping the tiger and trying to extinguish the Chinese people's revolution?

"Obtaining the Kuomintang army's separation from the Kuomintang, from individuals, from local cliques." This is completely a wild and deceitful talk, how can he say such things! The Kuomintang reactionaries, from Chiang Kai-shek to the big and small warlord leaders, are all representatives of the big landlords and big capitalists. They all know the importance of controlling the military. They all rose to power and became officials and rich through guns. "With guns comes power," "whoever has more guns has more power," this principle, they hold it very tightly. To make them give up their guns, to make robbers become good people, isn't it like skinning a tiger!

The so-called "our army becoming the national army" and "the party stopping direct leadership of the military." The state has always been a tool of class oppression, either a state of the proletariat or a state of the bourgeoisie. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime is a tool of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism oppressing the people, and the reactionary military is a major component of this regime. Our people's army absolutely cannot become such a "national army" and absolutely cannot leave the direct leadership of the Communist Party. Here, China's Khrushchev sweetly propagandizes that our people's army should become the "national army" of the reactionary government, serving the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek to annex the people's army.

"Achieving national democratization." Democracy is class-based. With bourgeois democracy, there will never be proletarian democracy. Bourgeois so-called "democracy," apart from deceiving and numbing the laboring people, cannot give them anything. Chairman Mao has pointed out many times that the Kuomintang "actually wants fascist one-party dictatorship," "it will not allow the people to easily gain any power while it loses a single hair." Chiang Kai-shek, while shouting "democracy" and "peace," mobilized millions of troops to attack the liberated areas, with cannon fire and smoke rolling, a nationwide civil war was already imminent. Chiang Kai-shek's "democracy" is the prelude to his launching a large-scale civil war. China's Khrushchev, at this critical historical juncture, spread such deceitful talk, which proves that he had long since degenerated into a shameful accomplice of Chiang Kai-shek in disarming revolutionary people and massacring revolutionary people.

China's Khrushchev also shouted that "this concession is in the interest of the people, not conceding is not an option, your private army, his private army, it will lead to division and war, democratization is impossible, so concessions are necessary." This is extremely reactionary! Is the revolutionary army led by the Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, a private army? Isn't the years-long life-and-death struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in China due to class oppression? Isn't the method to eliminate civil war to eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, rather than handing over the people's army to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary state to achieve the goal? What a "clever" logic! Here, what is progressive and what is reactionary, what is proletarian and what is bourgeois, what is revolutionary and what is counter-revolutionary, these boundaries all disappear. This is language that can only be found in the confessions of traitors, and it is not the same as Khrushchev's advocacy of eliminating war through disarmament and the destruction of nuclear weapons?

Lenin, when criticizing Kautsky, said: "Kautsky needs to use all kinds of evasions, sophistry, and deceitful forgeries, precisely to avoid violent revolution, to cover up his betrayal of this revolution." The matter is indeed not unique. China's Khrushchev was frightened by the war policy of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries and was also moved by their bribery policy. He was eager to go to the Kuomintang government to "become an official," realizing his yellow calabash dream of "a lifetime of wealth and honor," so he made up a bunch of "reasons" to cover up his fear of armed struggle and betrayal of the revolution. The so-called "giving up the military" is to give up the liberated areas of 130 million people, to give up the people's armed forces of 1.2 million soldiers and 2 million militiamen, to give up the fruits of victory that the Chinese people have fought for and shed blood for over the years. This is not a "concession" but a great betrayal of the revolutionary people. This great betrayal will not bring about "national progress," but only the degeneration of the military, the failure of the revolution, the suffering of the people, and the regression of history!

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the struggle is "a struggle over what kind of country to build. Is it to build a new democratic country led by the proletariat and serving the people, or to build a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country ruled by the big landlords and big capitalists?" This struggle was then manifested as Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to seize the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance and our resistance to his seizure. And China's Khrushchev, voluntarily handed over the fruits that the people deserve to Chiang Kai-shek, helping Chiang Kai-shek to drag China back to the old road of big landlord and big capitalist rule, burying the Chinese revolution, burying the world revolution. This is more right-opportunist than Chen Duxiu.

The laws of historical development are irresistible. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, the people's revolution finally kicked aside all kinds of obstacles from China's Khrushchev and others, advancing bravely, achieving one brilliant victory after another. And China's Khrushchev, because of his betrayal of the revolution, finally became a pile of filth despised by humanity!

    痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义谬论	空军　红群文
    在对待人民的兵权的问题上，是力争还是退让，这是毛主席的革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义路线斗争的一个焦点。
    毛主席科学地总结了国内外革命斗争的经验，非常精辟地指出：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”毛主席一贯主张“要争党的兵权，争人民的兵权”。
    抗日战争胜利后，人民公敌蒋介石对于人民是寸权必夺，寸利必得，表面上施放和平烟幕，骨子里积极准备全国规模的内战。在这两种命运、两个前途的决战时刻，毛主席提出：“我们的方针是针锋相对，寸土必争”。一方面不拒绝谈判，借以揭露国民党反动派的欺骗，同时准备用战斗来保卫人民的胜利果实，坚决依靠人民，打垮一切中外反动派。毛主席还明确指出：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”
    毛主席一针见血地指出：“这个时期如果有机会主义的话，那就是不力争，自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石。”中国的赫鲁晓夫就是当时最大的机会主义者。他大肆宣传什么“军队让一步，全国大进步”的投降主义谬论，明目张胆地反对毛主席的革命路线。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在一九四六年二月，抛出了一个《时局问题报告》。他说：“我们的军队成为国军、国防军、保安队、自卫队，……整编后党停止对军队的直接领导、指挥，统一于国防部，……采用此形式，保存了我们的军队。……用这个让步换得了我党的合法地位，换得了国民党军队也国家化，换得了国民党军队脱离党，脱离个人，脱离地方派系所有，换得全国民主化，就是军队让一步，全国大进步”。
    请看，这番话完全勾划出中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义的丑恶嘴脸！
    “保存了我们的军队”。人民的军队怎样才能保存？难道在共产党和人民自己手里，不能保存，反而只有交给国民党、交给人民公敌蒋介石倒能够保存吗？真是奇谈怪论！在人口不满两千，产谷不满万担的井冈山上，“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动”；人民军队不仅保存下来，而且大大发展了。在敌伪反动势力包围封锁的敌后抗日根据地，尽管条件极端困难，人民军队也能够保存和发展壮大起来。为什么在抗日战争胜利后，人民武装力量空前壮大的条件下，反而不能保存，必须交出去？这充分暴露出中国赫鲁晓夫是被美蒋反动派声势汹汹的武装进攻吓倒了！把军队交给蒋介石，这支军队是可能“保存”下来的，但是只能作为反动统治阶级的工具而“保存”下来，人民却从此失掉了枪杆子，重新陷入内外反动派统治压迫的水深火热之中。多列士、陶里亚蒂之流交出军队的结局就是如此。我们如果上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，也必然导致同样的罪恶结果。
      “换得了我党的合法地位”。共产党是要革命的。
    “革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”这完全合无产阶级的法，合人民的法，但绝对不会被剥削阶级的反动统治所容许。在资本主义制度下，要合法就不能革命，要革命就不可能合法。中国共产党一登上政治舞台，就是“无法无天”，以大无畏的革命精神，蔑视国民党反动政府的法律，放手发动工农，展开武装斗争，才得到发展壮大的。这是国民党反动头子蒋介石最痛恨、最没有办法对付的一着。蒋介石朝思暮想要用“交出军队就给合法地位”的圈套，诱骗我党上钩，以达到其不战而消灭我党我军的罪恶目的。中国赫鲁晓夫偏偏讲出这些黑话，难道不是为虎作伥，妄想扑灭中国人民革命吗？
    “换得了国民党军队脱离国民党，脱离个人，脱离地方派系所有”。这完全是异想天开的欺人之谈，亏他说得出口！国民党反动派，从蒋介石到大大小小的军阀头子，都是大地主大资产阶级的代表，他们都很懂得抓军队的重要。他们都是靠枪杆子起家，靠枪杆子升官发财的。“有军则有权”，“谁枪多谁就势大”，这个基点，他们是抓得很紧很紧的。要他们放弃枪杆子，要强盗收心作好人，岂不等于与虎谋皮！
    所谓“我们的军队成为国军”“党停止对军队的直接领导”。国家从来就是阶级压迫阶级的工具，不是无产阶级的国家，就是资产阶级的国家。蒋介石的反动政权，就是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义压迫人民的工具，而反动军队正是这个政权的主要组成部分。我们人民军队，绝不能去当这样的“国军”，绝不能离开共产党的直接领导。在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫甜蜜蜜地宣传要我们人民军队去当反动政府的“国军”，是为蒋介石并吞人民军队的阴谋效劳。
    “换得全国民主化”。民主是有阶级性的，有了资产阶级的民主，就决不会有无产阶级的民主。资产阶级的所谓“民主”，除了欺骗和麻醉劳动人民以外，不能给劳动人民一点东西。毛主席多次指出，国民党“实际上要的是法西斯主义的一党专政”，“是决不让人民轻易获得丝毫权力而使他们自己损失一根毫毛的”。蒋介石一面高喊“民主”、“和平”，一面调动几百万军队杀向解放区，炮声隆隆，硝烟滚滚，全国规模的内战早已迫在眉睫。蒋介石所喊的“民主”，是他发动大规模内战的前奏曲。中国的赫鲁晓夫在这个重要历史关头，大肆散布这种欺人之谈，这正证明他早已堕落成为蒋介石解除革命人民武装、屠杀革命人民的可耻帮凶了。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫还大叫什么“这个让步是适合人民利益的，不让步不行，你私有军队，他也私有军队，就要分裂、战争，民主化不可能，所以非让步不可。”真是反动透顶！难道中国共产党领导的全心全意为人民服务的革命军队是私有军队吗？难道中国多年来革命和反革命的决死斗争，不是由于阶级压迫所造成的吗？难道消除内战的方法，不是消灭国民党反动派，而是把人民的军队交给蒋介石的反动国家就能达到目的的吗？多么“高明”的逻辑！在这里，什么进步和反动，什么无产阶级和资产阶级，什么革命和反革命，这些界限统统消失了。这是只能在叛徒自白书上才找得到的语言，它和赫鲁晓夫宣扬的通过裁军和销毁核武器来消灭战争的论调，不是一模一样吗？
    列宁批判考茨基时说过：“考茨基需要运用一切遁词、诡辩和骗人的伪造，正是为的避开暴力革命，为的掩盖他背弃这种革命的行为”。事情正是无独有偶。中国的赫鲁晓夫被美蒋反动派的战争政策吓破了胆，又被他们的收买政策打动了心，急于要到国民党政府去“作官”，实现其“一生富贵何可期”的黄粱美梦，便胡诌出一大堆“理由”，以掩盖其害怕武装斗争、叛变革命的罪恶目的。所谓“军队让一步”，就是让出一亿三千万人口的解放区，让出一百二十万军队、二百万民兵的人民武装，让出中国人民多少年流血奋斗得来的胜利果实。这决不是什么“让步”，而是对革命人民的大叛卖。这个大叛卖换来的不可能是什么“全国大进步”，而只能是军队大变质，革命大失败，人民大遭殃，历史大倒退！
    毛主席早就指出：抗日战争胜利后的斗争，“就是建什么国的斗争。是建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家呢，还是建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？”这个斗争当时表现为蒋介石要抢夺抗战胜利果实和我们反对他的抢夺的斗争。而中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟自愿地把人民应得的果实送给蒋介石，帮助蒋介石把中国拖回到大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的老路，葬送中国革命事业，葬送世界革命事业。这是比陈独秀更陈独秀的右倾机会主义。
    历史发展的规律是不可抗拒的。在毛主席革命路线指引下的人民大革命，终于踢开了中国赫鲁晓夫之流的种种阻挠，勇往直前，夺取了一个又一个的光辉胜利。而中国的赫鲁晓夫，由于背叛革命，终于变成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆！
