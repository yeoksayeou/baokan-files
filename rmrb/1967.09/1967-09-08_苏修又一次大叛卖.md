The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, has drafted a "treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons" and has been boasting that this treaty meets the wishes of all countries in the world and has important significance for ensuring peace and security. They have been talking nonsense.

However, the people of the world see clearly that this draft treaty is a new piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionist clique's continued capitulation to U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the people of the world. This draft treaty was thrown out at a time when U.S. imperialism was taking new steps to escalate the war in Vietnam. In the past, the Soviet revisionist clique had pretended to declare that the United States could not improve U.S.-Soviet relations on the one hand while carrying out armed attacks on Vietnam on the other. But soon they contradicted themselves by shouting that the Vietnam issue should not be an obstacle to the conclusion of a U.S.-Soviet agreement to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Later, they even shamelessly declared that precisely because of the "intensification" of the situation in Vietnam, the conclusion of a U.S.-Soviet agreement to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons was more important than ever. Now, they hurriedly throw out the draft treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons to create an atmosphere for the new "peace talks" fraud and dirty deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue. This is another shameless betrayal of the Vietnamese people by the Soviet revisionist clique.

This draft treaty was also put forward at a time when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were colluding to force Arab countries to accept a "ceasefire," while the U.S. imperialist lackey Israel continued to occupy Arab territory. The Arab people are increasingly awakening and are rising up in a powerful anti-U.S. tide. At this time, the Soviet revisionist clique is colluding with the arch-enemy of the Arab people, U.S. imperialism, to stage a new nuclear fraud and nuclear threat, using their "nuclear hegemony" to pressure Arab countries. This is another shameless betrayal of the Arab people by the Soviet revisionist clique.

This draft treaty is the product of the Soviet revisionist clique's retreat and capitulation to U.S. imperialism and West German revanchism. In the past, the Soviet revisionist clique had declared its opposition to West Germany obtaining nuclear weapons in any way, and that the treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons should not have any loopholes in this regard. But now, the U.S.-Soviet draft treaty tacitly acknowledges the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear planning committee by the United States, allowing West Germany to effectively gain access to nuclear weapons, while the Soviet revisionist clique assumes the unilateral obligation not to proliferate nuclear weapons. In this way, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has betrayed the interests of the Soviet and Eastern European peoples, further seriously threatening the security of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

The Soviet revisionist clique says that they are doing this to promote "complete and thorough disarmament." What "complete and thorough disarmament"? This is originally a deceptive thing. And their so-called treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons does not prohibit the United States from conducting underground nuclear tests, does not prohibit the United States from manufacturing nuclear weapons, does not prohibit the United States from stockpiling nuclear weapons, does not prohibit the United States from establishing nuclear bases all over the world, does not prohibit the United States' nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft from roaming freely, and does not prohibit the United States from using nuclear weapons. This treaty deprives those non-nuclear countries that are threatened and invaded of the right to develop nuclear weapons to resist U.S.-Soviet nuclear blackmail, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union can continue to engage in nuclear weapons, arbitrarily expand nuclear armaments, and brazenly carry out nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats.

It is clear that the so-called treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons will not only fail to ensure the security of the peoples of all countries in the world, but on the contrary, it greatly encourages U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, so that the U.S. and the Soviet Union can jointly suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world. The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, stages this nuclear fraud, which is a thorough and complete betrayal of the peoples of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The atom bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people."

The revolutionary people of the world are not afraid. They dare to struggle and dare to win. All oppressed peoples, through people's war, can defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices. The day when the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries are buried will not be far off.

　　苏修又一次大叛卖
　　本报评论员
    苏修集团伙同美帝炮制了“防止核扩散”条约草案之后，大肆吹嘘什么这个条约符合世界“各种国家的愿望”呀，对于保障和平安全具有“重要的意义”呀，说得天花乱坠。
    但是，世界人民看得很清楚，这个条约草案是苏修集团在美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈之后，继续投降美帝，出卖世界人民的一个新罪证。
    这个条约草案，是在美帝对越南采取新的战争“升级”行动的情况下抛出来的。过去，苏修集团曾经装模作样地扬言，美国不能一方面打算改善美苏关系，而同时却对越南进行武装袭击。但是，不久它们就自己打自己嘴巴，叫嚷越南问题不应当是美苏达成“防止核扩散”协议的障碍。后来，它们更恬不知耻地表示，正是因为越南局势的“尖锐化”，美苏达成“防止核扩散”协议就“比任何时候都更重要”。现在，它们急急忙忙地抛出“防止核扩散”条约草案，来为美苏在越南问题上推行新的“和谈”骗局和进行肮脏交易制造气氛。这是苏修集团对越南人民的又一次无耻的叛卖。
    这个条约草案，也是在美苏串通一气迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”，而美帝的走狗以色列却继续侵占着阿拉伯国家领土的情况下提出的。阿拉伯人民日益觉醒起来，正在掀起一个强大的反美浪潮。在这个时候，苏修集团却同阿拉伯人民的死敌美帝国主义进行新的勾结，大搞核骗局，进行核威胁，利用它们的“核霸王”地位，对阿拉伯国家施加压力。这是苏修集团对阿拉伯人民的又一次无耻的叛卖。
    这个条约草案，是苏修集团对美帝国主义和西德复仇主义实行退让投降的产物。过去，苏修集团曾经扬言反对西德以任何方式取得核武器，“防止核扩散”条约不得在这方面有任何漏洞。可是，现在美苏的条约草案，却默认美国成立北大西洋集团核计划委员会，使西德实际上得以染指核武器，而苏修集团却承担片面不扩散核武器的义务。这样，苏修叛徒集团就出卖了苏联人民和东欧国家人民的利益，使苏联和东欧国家的安全都进一步受到严重的威胁。
    苏修集团说，它们这样做是为了促进“全面彻底裁军”。什么“全面彻底裁军”？这本来就是骗人的东西。而它们搞的所谓“防止核扩散”条约，一不禁止美国进行地下核试验，二不禁止美国制造核武器，三不禁止美国储存核武器，四不禁止美国在世界各地建立核基地，五不禁止美国的核潜艇、核飞机到处乱窜，六不禁止美国使用核武器。这个条约，剥夺了那些遭受威胁和侵略的无核国家发展核武器抵抗美苏核讹诈的权利，而美苏却可以继续大搞核武器，任意扩张核军备，放肆地实行核讹诈和核威胁。
    可见，所谓“防止核扩散”条约，不但绝不会保障世界各国人民的安全，恰恰相反，它大大鼓励了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，以便于美苏合伙镇压世界各国人民的革命斗争。苏修集团伙同美帝炮制这个核骗局，是对全世界人民的又一次彻头彻尾的大叛卖。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎”。
    世界革命人民是吓不倒的。他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利。一切被压迫人民，用人民战争就能够打败美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶。美帝、苏修和一切反动派统统被埋葬的日子不会很远了。
