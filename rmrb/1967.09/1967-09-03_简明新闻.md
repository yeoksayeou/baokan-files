	Japanese Youth Angrily Attacks U.S. Embassy in Japan
	On the afternoon of August 31, a Japanese youth carried gasoline into the U.S. Embassy in Japan and set fire to three cars. The youth calmly walked away as Japanese police and U.S. diplomats hurried to extinguish the fire.

	This is the fourth attack on the U.S. Embassy since the assassination of former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Reischauer, in 1964. Following the incident, the Japanese government was in a state of panic. Prime Minister Sato and the Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, Fujieda, apologized to their American masters.

	Palestinians Continue Armed Resistance Against Israel
	The Arab people of occupied Palestine, despite the brutal suppression by Israeli fascists, continue their armed resistance against the Israeli invaders. On August 28, an Israeli military truck was hit by a landmine near the Gabiliya camp, about four kilometers southeast of Gaza City, injuring four soldiers. Subsequently, Israeli troops deployed a large number of soldiers for a search but found nothing.

	Algeria Nationalizes Five U.S. Oil Companies
	The Algerian government announced on August 30 that it would nationalize five U.S. oil companies operating in Algeria starting from August 29. These companies are: Esso Standard Oil Company of Algeria, Esso Africa Oil Company, Esso Sahara Oil Company, Mobil North Africa Oil Company, and Mobil France Oil Company.

	Sato's Reactionary Government Provides Aid to Indian Reactionaries
	Following the dictates of U.S. imperialism, the Sato reactionary government took advantage of India's severe economic difficulties to provide economic "aid" to India, aiming to expand Japanese monopoly capital into Southeast Asia. According to the Japan Economic Journal, during the recent visit by Desai, the Japanese Sato government decided to provide the Indian reactionary government with a seventh yen loan worth $45 million and a "special food aid loan" worth $7 million. The Japan Economic Journal openly admitted that this "special food aid loan" to India was decided upon at the special request of U.S. President's special advisor, Rostow, in early this year. U.S. imperialism is colluding with some capitalist countries and Soviet revisionists to provide food "aid" to Indian reactionaries.

	Malaysian Reactionary Regime to Take 20 Years to Repay Debts
	The Finance Minister of the Malaysian (including Singapore) Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew reactionary clique, Tan Siew Sin, recently announced that as of July 31 this year, Malaysia's accumulated internal and external debts totaled over 3.2 billion Malaysian dollars, which will not be repaid until after 1990.
