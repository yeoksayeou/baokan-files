The political work conference for support-the-left troops in industrial and mining enterprises held by the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army concluded successfully on the 20th in the midst of the triumphant songs of the great alliance of revolution in the capital. The attendees, filled with joy, firmly declared: We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively help the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses achieve a great revolutionary alliance, and be the steadfast promoters of the great alliance of revolution in the capital.

This conference summarized and exchanged experiences in helping industrial and mining enterprises carry out a great revolutionary criticism, achieve a great revolutionary alliance, and implement the "three-in-one combination." During the conference, the attendees studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions pointed the way forward for everyone. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with a "seize-the-day" revolutionary spirit, studying, propagating, and acting simultaneously. They conveyed and arranged tasks for the support-the-left personnel in their units, inviting the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to the conference venue to study together and discuss how to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, quickly achieving a great revolutionary alliance. Within three days, more than 80% of the industrial and mining enterprises reached by the support-the-left personnel achieved a great revolutionary alliance.

During the conference, Vice Premier and Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Xie Fuzhi, and Commander of the Beijing Garrison Fu Chongbi, among others, received all the attendees. Xie Fuzhi made an important speech, urging everyone to firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and accelerate the great revolutionary alliance of the working class in the capital, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing's industrial and mining enterprises to a new stage.

The attendees believed that the most fundamental and primary task of carrying out the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on the People's Liberation Army supporting the broad leftist masses is to arm the broad leftist masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The most important current task is to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and together with the broad revolutionary workers, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fight against all erroneous tendencies that disrupt the great revolutionary alliance, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and prevent the class enemy's instigation and all disruptive activities.

At the conference, the soldiers also studied the tasks of support-the-left work after achieving the great revolutionary alliance. They pointed out that achieving the great revolutionary alliance is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. After the working class unites, they must spare no effort to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, completely expose and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as the chief representative, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. In the process of revolutionary criticism, continuously develop and consolidate the great revolutionary alliance. Through revolutionary criticism, mobilize the broad working class to conduct a thorough sweep of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology, politically and ideologically building an iron wall against revisionism.

　　北京卫戍区召开工矿企业支左部队政治工作会议
　　坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示
　　积极促进革命派实现革命大联合
    据新华社二十一日讯　中国人民解放军北京卫戍区召开的工矿企业支左部队政治工作会议，二十日在首都革命大联合的凯歌声中胜利闭幕。到会人员满怀喜悦的心情，坚定地表示：坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，积极帮助无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众实现革命的大联合，做首都革命大联合的坚强促进派。
    这次会议总结和交流了帮助工矿企业开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命“三结合”的经验。会议期间，到会人员学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。毛主席的最新指示，给大家指明了前进的方向。大家紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，边学习，边宣传，边行动，纷纷向所在单位的支左人员传达布置，有的把革命群众组织的负责人请到会场来，共同学习，共同研究如何响应毛主席的伟大号召，迅速实现革命大联合。三天之内，支左人员到达的工矿企业有百分之八十以上实现了革命的大联合。
    会议期间，国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治，北京卫戍区司令员傅崇碧等接见了到会全体同志。谢富治同志作了重要指示，他要求大家一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，加紧促进首都工人阶级实现革命大联合，把北京市工矿企业的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。
    到会的同志认为，执行伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的指示，最根本最首要的，就是用毛泽东思想武装左派广大群众。当前最重要的任务，就是要大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，和广大革命工人在一起，活学活用毛主席最新指示，增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，牢固地树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，坚决同各种破坏革命大联合的错误倾向作斗争，提高革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的挑拨离间和一切破坏活动。
    会上，指战员们还研究了实现革命大联合以后支左工作的任务。他们指出，必须看到，实现革命大联合只是万里长征走完了第一步。工人阶级联合起来以后，就要全力以赴，深入地开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭，搞好本单位的斗批改。在革命的大批判中，不断发展和巩固革命的大联合。通过革命的大批判，发动广大工人阶级对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的思想进行一次大扫荡，从政治上、思想上筑起一道反修防修的铜墙铁壁。
