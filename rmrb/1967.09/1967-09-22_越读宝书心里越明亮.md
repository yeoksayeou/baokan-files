A worker from southern Sudan obtained a copy of the Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," in February this year. He carried this precious book with him at all times and read it whenever he had the chance. He said, "After reading it for a whole week, I felt much brighter inside."

Just as he was studying this book of quotations, a friend of his found out about it and immediately borrowed it to read. His friend kept the book in his pocket during the day, reading it whenever he had a moment, and placed it by his pillow at night to prevent it from getting lost. However, one day, the book went missing. It turned out that another friend, eager to read the quotations, had taken it.

Soon, more than thirty of the worker's colleagues and friends knew that he had a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." They all made appointments to borrow and read it. In the end, they had to hold a meeting and decide on a schedule for taking turns to read the book.

　  越读宝书心里越明亮
    一位苏丹南部的工人在今年二月间，得到了一本小红书——《毛主席语录》。他把这本宝书随身带着，随时阅读。他说：“我读了整整一个星期，心里就觉得明亮多了。”
    正当他学习这本语录的时候，他的一位朋友知道了这件事，立即把这本语录借去阅读。他的朋友白天把语录放在口袋里，一有空就看，晚间读后放在枕头旁边，以防丢失。可是，有一天，这本语录还是不见了。原来是被另一位急于想读这本语录的朋友拿走了。
    很快地，这位工人的三十多位同事和朋友都知道了他有一本《毛主席语录》。他们纷纷向他预约借读。最后他们只好开了个会，商定了轮流阅读的次序和时间。
