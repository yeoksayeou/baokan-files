The U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionaries are tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion. The sixth session of the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs, which began on September 13 in Washington, concluded on September 15. This meeting was held after the secret talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Glassboro and before Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato's upcoming visits to several countries and regions in Asia and the Pacific. This meeting is a further plot by U.S. imperialism to implement anti-China policies in Asia and the Pacific, to oppose the national liberation movements in Asia, and to encourage the Japanese reactionaries to more actively serve the U.S. in its expansion of the Vietnam War.

The U.S. delegation, led by Dean Rusk, and the Japanese delegation, led by Takeo Miki, held three days of secret discussions on the situation in Asia and international issues centered around the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and anti-China policies, as well as economic and trade relations between the U.S. and Japan, and U.S.-Japan cooperation in the development of Southeast Asia.

The meeting also discussed strengthening the U.S. war in Vietnam. Takeo Miki openly praised "America's efforts in South Vietnam" and expressed Japan's willingness to act as a spearhead for the U.S. war in Vietnam. During the meeting, Takeo Miki held secret talks with Dean Rusk, Hubert Humphrey, and Robert McNamara on the issue of the U.S. returning Okinawa and the Bonin Islands. According to the Asahi Shimbun, during the talks, the U.S. insisted on maintaining control over these two islands. Dean Rusk stated, "As long as the situation in the Far East remains tense, it is necessary for the U.S. to maintain administrative control over Okinawa and the Bonin Islands."

The meeting also discussed the issue of "joint cooperation" between Japan and the U.S. in economically invading Asia.

　　美帝同日本反动派加紧反革命勾结
    美日经济会议密谋侵略亚洲的阴谋计划
    据新华社十八日讯　从十三日开始在华盛顿举行的第六次美日贸易和经济事务联合委员会会议，十五日宣布收场。这次会议是美苏葛拉斯堡罗秘密会谈之后和日本首相佐藤荣作即将到亚洲和太平洋地区一系列国家和地区活动之前举行的。这是美帝国主义进一步策划在亚洲和太平洋地区推行反华政策、反对亚洲民族解放运动和促进日本反动派更积极地为美帝扩大侵越战争效劳的一次会议。
    以腊斯克为首的美国代表团和以三木武夫为首的日本代表团在三天的秘密会议上讨论了以美帝侵越战争和反华为中心的亚洲形势及国际问题、美日两国的经济贸易关系以及美日合作开发东南亚问题。
    会议还讨论了加强美帝侵越战争的问题。三木武夫露骨地称赞“美国在南越的努力”，并表示日本愿意甘当美帝侵越战争的马前卒。在会议期间，三木武夫先后同腊斯克、汉弗莱和麦克纳马拉就美国归还冲绳和小笠原群岛问题进行了秘密会谈。据《朝日新闻》报道，在会谈中，美国坚持霸占这两个群岛的态度。腊斯克表示，“只要远东形势继续紧张，美国就有必要掌握冲绳和小笠原群岛的行政权。”
    会议还讨论了日美两国“共同合作”向亚洲进行经济侵略的问题。
