The Soviet revisionist cargo ship "Svirlsk" staged an anti-China provocation at our Dalian Port on August 6. After being severely punished by our revolutionary masses, it has slunk back with its tail between its legs.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, instead of admitting their guilt for this anti-China farce they plotted and directed, has instead activated their propaganda machine, churning out anti-China articles and using lies to cover up their anti-China crimes. Major newspapers and TASS in Moscow have been publishing dispatches, articles, news, and photos one after another, distorting facts, turning black into white, and on the one hand, slandering the just struggle of our revolutionary masses as "illegal actions," while on the other hand, boasting about the so-called "resilience" and "brave and steadfast spirit" of the crew of the "Svirlsk." They truly do not know what shame is!

Lies cannot cover up the truth. The staff of the Dalian Border Inspection Station are the ones who understand, know, and have the right to speak about the truth of the "Svirlsk" incident the best. It was clearly the second mate, Ivanov, and a crew member of the "Svirlsk" who demanded a badge of our great leader Chairman Mao from us, and then in front of us, they maliciously insulted it by throwing it into the sea. This fact witnessed by all is an ironclad crime. Can the lies of the Moscow newspapers cover this up?

The more the mouthpieces of the Soviet revisionists try to shift the blame with their sophistry, the more they reveal the footprints of the directors of this anti-China farce. Look, this is how the Soviet revisionist newspapers report it:

*The Labor Newspaper* says, "A Chinese border guard soldier shoved a Mao Zedong badge into Ivanov's hand," while *Red Star Newspaper* says, "Ivanov refused to wear the badge on his chest."

*The Truth Newspaper* says, "The captain wanted to contact the Soviet embassy in Beijing, but he was not allowed to do so," while *The Labor Newspaper* admits, "The captain and the first mate called the (Soviet) embassy," and the embassy instructed them that they "had the right to do so."

Isn't all this self-contradictory and self-defeating?

Up to now, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been stuttering and dodging, not daring to let the Soviet people know the truth of the "Svirlsk" incident. This is completely because they are guilty and know that their evidence is in our hands.

The more the Soviet revisionist lords fear their own weaknesses, the more we will expose their sores and put their evidence on display. In the face of our revolutionary masses, the provocateurs of the Soviet revisionist cargo ship, due to the overwhelming evidence, have no choice but to admit their guilt and write a confession. The second mate Ivanov wrote in his confession: "My mistake was that I threw the commemorative badge of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong into the sea. I insulted Chairman Mao Zedong.... I will never do it again." The captain Korzhov also wrote in his confession: "...I obstructed you from carrying out your duties. I will never do it again." Their confessions, in black and white, signed and sealed, are something the Soviet revisionist leadership cannot cut off. You insist on puffing up your faces to boast about your "brave and steadfast spirit," which only shows how shameless and weak you are!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "The most hardened elements will never admit their defeat. This is because they need to deceive not only others but also themselves, otherwise they cannot live."

The Soviet revisionist leadership is exactly such a bunch of hardliners who rely on self-deception and deception to live. They now want to use the smoke screen of lies and slander to cover up their despicable anti-China faces and deceive the Soviet people who do not know the truth.

However, you cannot hide fire with paper. The Soviet people will not want to be used as anti-China tools by the Soviet revisionist leadership. We believe that under the great influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the shining light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of the Soviet people will break through the numerous nets set up by the Soviet revisionist leadership, rise up in rebellion, rise up in revolution, and throw this bunch of traitors into the garbage heap of history!

    可怜的撒谎者	大连边防检查站　卞　政
    苏修货船“斯维尔斯克”号八月六日在我国大连港制造反华挑衅事件，遭到我革命群众的严厉惩罚以后，已经夹着尾巴溜回去了。
    苏修领导集团对于他们所策划和导演的这出反华丑剧，不但毫不认罪，反而开动他们的宣传机器，大做反华文章，用谎言来掩盖他们的反华罪行。莫斯科的一些主要报刊和塔斯社接二连三地发表通讯、文章、消息和照片，歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，一面诬蔑我国革命群众的正义斗争是什么“非法”行动，一面又吹嘘“斯维尔斯克”号船员的所谓“毅力”和“勇敢坚定精神”。真是不知人间还有羞耻事！
    谎言是掩盖不了真相的。我们大连边防检查站的工作人员，对于“斯维尔斯克”号事件的真相最了解，最清楚，最有发言权。明明是“斯维尔斯克”号货船二副依万诺夫和一名船员出头向我们索取伟大领袖毛主席的像章，然后又当着我们的面肆意加以侮辱，把一枚像章扔入海内。这个有目共睹的事实，铁证如山的罪行，难道是莫斯科报刊的胡说八道所能抵赖得了的吗？
    苏修集团的喉舌越是想用狡辩来推卸罪责，就越是露出这一出反华丑剧的导演者的马脚来。请看，苏修的报刊是怎样说的：
    《劳动报》说，一个中国边防军战士向依万诺夫“手中塞了一个毛泽东像章”；而《红星报》却说是“依万诺夫拒绝了把像章挂在自己的胸上”。
    《真理报》说，“船长想和驻北京的苏联使馆取得联系，但是不允许他这样做”；而《劳动报》却承认，“船长和大副给（苏联）使馆挂了电话”，大使馆指示他们“有权利这样做”。
    这一切不是自相矛盾，自打嘴巴吗？
    到现在为止，苏修领导集团一直是吞吞吐吐，躲躲闪闪，不敢让苏联人民知道“斯维尔斯克”号事件的真相。这完全是因为他们做贼心虚，知道他们的把柄掌握在我们的手里。
    苏联修正主义老爷们，你们越是害怕自己的痛处，我们就越要揭你们的疮疤，把你们的罪证拿出来示众。在我国革命群众的面前，苏修货船的挑衅者由于事实俱在，无法抵赖，不得不低头认罪，并写下了认罪书。二副依万诺夫在认罪书上写道：“我的过错是，我把伟大领袖毛泽东主席像的纪念章扔到海里去了。我侮辱了毛泽东主席。……今后决不再犯。”船长柯尔若夫也在认罪书上说：“……我阻碍了你们执行任务，今后决不再犯。”他们的认罪书，白纸黑字，签字画押，苏修领导集团是砍也砍不掉的。你们硬要打肿脸充胖子，吹嘘什么“勇敢坚定精神”，这只能更加表明你们是多么的无耻，多么的虚弱！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。”
    苏修领导集团就是这样一伙专靠自欺欺人的办法来过日子的死硬分子。他们现在就是想用谎言和诽谤的烟幕来掩盖自己反华的卑劣嘴脸，欺骗不明真相的苏联人民。
    但是，纸是包不住火的。苏联人民决不会愿意充当苏修领导集团的反华工具。我们相信，在中国文化大革命的巨大影响下，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，广大的苏联人民一定会冲破苏修领导集团设置的重重罗网，起来造反，起来革命，把这一撮叛徒扔进历史的垃圾堆！
