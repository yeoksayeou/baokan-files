The Soviet revisionist group and Ilya Ehrenburg are both scum of humanity. The veteran revisionist writer and traitor Ilya Ehrenburg has died of illness. Brezhnev and his ilk are mourning as if they had lost a parent.

New China News Agency, September 11th: Moscow reports that the veteran revisionist writer of the Soviet Union and a trusted henchman of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Ilya Ehrenburg, has recently died of illness.

After Ehrenburg's death, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others, in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, issued a eulogy and sent a wreath on his behalf. The eulogy expressed "deep sorrow" over Ehrenburg's death. They also sent Georgadze, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Paletskis, Chairman of the Nationalities Council, to attend the vigil.

Ehrenburg was a complete opportunist and counter-revolutionary. During the favorable revolutionary situation in Russia from 1905 to 1907, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. In 1908, he was arrested by the tsarist authorities. This coward was terrified and, upon his release, fled to France, betraying the revolution. It was not until the 1930s that he opportunistically returned to the Soviet Union to settle down, saying he wanted to "secure his own place" in the Soviet Union. He said that at this time he had not "abandoned" the things he had previously cherished, and he used "gritting his teeth" and "silence" to conceal his hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: Those who want to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. The Soviet revisionist leadership's special appreciation for Ehrenburg is precisely because he was the first to jump out and prepare counter-revolutionary public opinion in the Soviet revisionist group's activities to restore capitalism.

This counter-revolutionary double-dealer, at the time of the death of the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, used the most beautiful words to praise Stalin. However, just half a year later, he could not wait to throw out the poisonous weed "On the Work of the Writer" he had long written but dared not publish, slandering that the revolutionary literature of the Soviet Union "did not represent people but machines," advocating writing whatever one wants to write and writing about "unhealthy phenomena" in society and other such things, launching a naked attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system.

In 1954, Ehrenburg threw out the long novel "The Thaw," which viciously attacked Stalin. Under Ehrenburg's leadership, works opposing the socialist system emerged one after another, forming a reactionary black tide known in the West as "thaw literature."

After the 20th Congress of the CPSU openly raised the black flag of anti-Stalin and restoring capitalism, Ehrenburg became the black vanguard of the Soviet revisionist group. He publicly cursed Stalin as a "tyrant" and the dictatorship of the proletariat as "tyranny." He desperately exaggerated the horror of war, saying that "war means not only killing others but also killing oneself"; he eagerly beautified imperialism, saying that people like Kennedy had "good intentions and reason"; he advocated surrendering to imperialism, saying that "this is the surrender of the dead to the living." He rampantly opposed China, viciously attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the field of literature and art, he openly advocated the bourgeoisie's so-called super-class "humanity" and "love for humanity," praising traitor writers like Pasternak and modernist, formalist, and other decadent art schools from the West. He shamelessly publicly expressed his belief in the idealist view of "I think, therefore I am."

The Soviet revisionist group praises such a reactionary bourgeois element as an "outstanding" figure, making the broad Soviet people once again clearly see that the Soviet revisionist group is a bunch of scum, just like Ehrenburg, who are despised by humanity.

### 苏修集团和爱伦堡都是不齿于人类的狗屎堆  老牌修正主义文人大叛徒爱伦堡病死　勃列日涅夫之流如丧考妣

    苏修集团和爱伦堡都是不齿于人类的狗屎堆
    老牌修正主义文人大叛徒爱伦堡病死　勃列日涅夫之流如丧考妣
    新华社十一日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联老牌修正主义文人，苏修领导集团的得力打手爱伦堡，最近病死。
    爱伦堡死后，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流以苏共中央、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联部长会议的名义，替他发了讣告并献花圈。这个讣告对爱伦堡的死表示“非常沉痛”。他们还派出了苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书格奥尔加泽、民族院主席帕列茨基斯前往守灵。
    爱伦堡是一个十足的投机分子和反革命。他在一九○五——一九○七年俄国革命形势大好时混进革命队伍。一九○八年被沙皇当局逮捕，这个胆小鬼吓破了胆，被释放后即逃往法国，背叛了革命。直到三十年代，他才又投机回到苏联定居，用他自己的话说，要在苏联“占据自己的一席地位”。他说，他这时也“并没有放弃”他“过去所珍视的东西”，他用“咬紧牙齿”、“沉默”来隐蔽他对无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的仇视。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。苏修领导集团之所以特别赏识爱伦堡，也正是因为他在苏修集团复辟资本主义的活动中，是最早跳出来进行反革命舆论准备的一个。
    这个反革命两面派在伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林逝世时，用最美好的词句来赞扬斯大林，可是刚过了半年，他就迫不及待地抛出他早已写成而迟迟不敢出笼的毒草《谈作家的工作》，诬蔑苏联的革命文艺“表现的并不是人，而是机器”，鼓吹要写什么就写什么，写社会上的“不健全现象”等等，赤裸裸地向无产阶级专政和社会主义制度进攻。
    一九五四年，爱伦堡抛出了恶毒攻击斯大林的长篇小说《解冻》。在爱伦堡带头下，反对社会主义制度的“作品”纷纷出笼，形成了被西方资产阶级称为“解冻文学”的一股反动黑潮。
    苏共二十大公开扯起大反斯大林、大搞资本主义复辟的黑旗以后，爱伦堡更是苏修集团的黑先锋。他公开咒骂斯大林是“暴君”，无产阶级专政是“暴政”。他拚命渲染战争恐怖，说什么“战争意味着不单是杀人，而且是自杀”；竭力美化帝国主义，说什么肯尼迪之流“有善良愿望和理智”；鼓吹向帝国主义投降，说什么“这是死对生的投降”。他猖狂反华，恶毒攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。在文学艺术方面，他公开鼓吹资产阶级用以骗人的、所谓超阶级的“人性”、“人类之爱”等等，赞扬帕斯捷尔纳克之流叛徒作家和现代主义、形式主义之类西方颓废艺术流派。他还恬不知耻地公开表示自己信仰“我思故我在”的唯心主义观点。
    苏修集团把这样反动的资产阶级分子吹捧为“杰出”人物，使广大苏联人民再一次看清楚，苏修集团也就是一批与爱伦堡同样货色的不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
