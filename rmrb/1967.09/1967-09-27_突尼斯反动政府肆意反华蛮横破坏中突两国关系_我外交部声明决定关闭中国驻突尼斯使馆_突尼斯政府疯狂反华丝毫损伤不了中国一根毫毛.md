The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China declares the closure of the Chinese Embassy in Tunisia
The Tunisian government's frenzied anti-China actions will not harm China in the slightest

New China News Agency, September 26th

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on September 26th, 1967, regarding the closure of the Chinese Embassy in the Tunisian Republic. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on the Closure of the Chinese Embassy in the Tunisian Republic

September 26th, 1967, Beijing

On September 19th, 1967, the Tunisian Republic's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bourguiba Jr., summoned our Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, Li Yifan, to present an ultimatum regarding the note sent by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 14th. The ultimatum made the most unreasonable demands, setting a deadline for the Chinese Embassy to submit an apology to the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Otherwise, the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy would be declared persona non grata and expelled from the country.

On September 24th, the Tunisian reactionary government further revealed Bourguiba Jr.'s unreasonable demands through its radio and newspapers, threatening that if its conditions were not met, even if the Chinese government sent new diplomatic personnel, they would not be accepted. This further escalated the pressure on the Chinese government.

The Tunisian reactionary government's arrogant and brazen attitude is a grave insult to the great People's Republic of China and its 700 million people. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government and people. We express our utmost indignation and lodge the strongest protest.

The Tunisian reactionary government's evil intentions are clear: to completely sabotage the relations between the two countries while shifting the blame onto China. This is the inevitable result of the Tunisian reactionary government's persistent pursuit of a pro-American, anti-China policy. It will not be able to escape its responsibility.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tunisia, the Tunisian reactionary government has taken a series of steps to worsen the relations between the two countries. Especially this year, the Bourguiba reactionary clique has been even more brazen in spreading anti-China rhetoric, defaming China's foreign policy and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in China, and even launching vicious attacks on Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. The Tunisian reactionary government has further adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese Embassy, prohibiting the issuance of news bulletins, restricting and obstructing the normal activities of embassy personnel, and illegally detaining a Chinese table tennis coach invited to work in Tunisia. The Tunisian reactionary government has repeatedly colluded with the political corpse Chiang Kai-shek, whom the Chinese people have long spat upon, to conspire with the American imperialists to create the "two Chinas" plot, and to rudely interfere in China's internal affairs. Can the Tunisian reactionary government deny these facts?

The Chinese government has always insisted on handling relations with Tunisia based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, making unremitting efforts to maintain normal relations between the two countries. In the face of the Tunisian reactionary government's anti-China activities, we have always adopted a restrained attitude, only responding when we can no longer bear it. The note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 14th presented facts and reasoned arguments, was just and unassailable. Bourguiba Jr. could not make any substantial rebuttal and could only nitpick about the form and wording of the note. We are completely in the right and have no need to apologize.

The Chinese government had hoped that the Tunisian government would still prioritize the interests of the peoples of the two countries, change its hostile attitude towards China, stop anti-China activities, and maintain the relations between the two countries. However, the Tunisian reactionary government not only did not change its ways but insisted on disregarding all consequences and completely sabotaging the relations between the two countries. Under these circumstances, the Chinese Embassy in Tunisia can no longer continue its work. Therefore, the Chinese government has no choice but to announce the closure of the Chinese Embassy in Tunisia and recall all diplomatic and administrative personnel.

The Chinese people have always cherished the deep friendship established with the Tunisian people in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Although the relations between the two countries have been sabotaged to this extent by the Tunisian reactionary government, the Chinese government and people will continue to make every possible effort to maintain and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian peoples. When the Tunisian government's pro-American, anti-China policy is truly changed, the Chinese government will send diplomatic personnel again to resume the work of the Chinese Embassy in Tunisia.

We solemnly warn the Tunisian reactionary government that no matter how far you go in your anti-China actions, you will not be able to harm China in the slightest. No anti-China pretext can make you escape the responsibility for completely sabotaging the relations between the two countries. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries is unbreakable by anyone.

　　突尼斯反动政府肆意反华蛮横破坏中突两国关系
　　我外交部声明决定关闭中国驻突尼斯使馆
　　突尼斯政府疯狂反华丝毫损伤不了中国一根毫毛
    新华社二十六日讯　中华人民共和国外交部九月二十六日发表了关于关闭中国驻突尼斯共和国大使馆的声明。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部关于关闭中国驻突尼斯共和国大使馆的声明
          一九六七年九月二十六日于北京
    一九六七年九月十九日，突尼斯共和国外交部长小布尔吉巴约见我国驻突尼斯共和国大使馆临时代办李一帆，以最后通牒的形式，就九月十四日中国外交部致突尼斯外交部的照会，提出了最无理的要求，限期中国大使馆向突尼斯外交部递交所谓道歉照会，否则，将宣布中国大使馆全体人员为不受欢迎的人，并驱逐出境，云云。
    九月二十四日，突尼斯反动政府又通过其电台和报纸，透露了小布尔吉巴的无理要求，并且扬言如不满足其条件，即使中国政府另派外交人员去突，也将不被接受，进一步对中国政府进行要挟。
    突尼斯反动政府这种狂妄蛮横的态度，是对伟大的中华人民共和国和七亿中国人民的莫大侮辱，是中国政府和中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。对此，我们表示极大的愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    突尼斯反动政府的罪恶目的，很明显是要彻底破坏中突两国的关系，而又把责任推给中国。这是突尼斯反动政府一贯顽固地执行亲美反华政策的必然结果。它要想逃脱其责任，那是绝对办不到的。
    自中突建交后，突尼斯反动政府采取了一系列恶化两国关系的步骤。特别是今年以来，布尔吉巴反动统治集团，更加肆意散布反华言论，诽谤中国的外交政策和中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，甚至对中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席进行恶毒的攻击。突尼斯反动政府对中国大使馆进一步采取敌视态度，禁止大使馆发行新闻公报，限制和阻挠使馆人员的正常活动，非法扣留应邀在突尼斯工作的中国乒乓球教练。突尼斯反动政府还一再同被中国人民早已唾弃的政治僵尸蒋介石匪帮勾勾搭搭，配合美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋，粗暴干涉中国内政。所有这些事实，难道是突尼斯反动政府能够抵赖得了的吗？
    中国政府始终坚持根据和平共处五项原则处理同突尼斯的关系，为维护中突两国正常关系作出了不懈的努力。对突尼斯反动政府的反华活动，我们一直采取克制的态度，只是在忍无可忍的情况下，中国政府才不得不予以必要的回答。中国外交部九月十四日的照会，摆事实，讲道理，义正词严，无懈可击。小布尔吉巴作不出任何实质性的答辩，只能在照会的所谓形式、用词上做文章。我们完全有理，无歉可道。
    中国政府原来希望，突尼斯政府还能以中突两国人民的利益为重，改变敌视中国的态度，停止反华活动，维护两国关系。但是，突尼斯反动政府不但不悬崖勒马，相反，执意不顾一切后果，彻底破坏了两国关系。在此情况下，中国驻突尼斯大使馆已经完全不可能在突尼斯继续工作下去。因此，中国政府不得不宣布关闭中国驻突尼斯大使馆，并召回大使馆所有外交官和工作人员。
    中国人民从来珍惜在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，同富有阿拉伯战斗传统的突尼斯人民建立起来的深厚友谊。尽管两国关系已被突尼斯反动政府破坏到如此地步，中国政府和中国人民仍将继续为维护和发展中突人民的友谊而作出一切可能的努力。在突尼斯政府的亲美反华政策被真正改变了的时候，中国政府将重新派出外交人员，恢复中国驻突尼斯大使馆的工作。
    我们严正警告突尼斯反动政府，无论你们反华到何等程度，都不可能损伤中国一根毫毛。任何反华借口也不可能使你们逃脱彻底破坏中突两国关系的责任。中突两国人民的友谊是任何人也破坏不了的。
