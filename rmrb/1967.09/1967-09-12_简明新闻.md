A Chinese delegation of news workers visits Vietnam

According to the 1967 implementation plan of the China-Vietnam cultural cooperation agreement, a delegation of Chinese news workers led by Guo Longchun, a reporter from the People's Daily, departed Beijing by plane on the 11th to visit Vietnam for a friendly visit.

Vietnamese military and civilians shoot down eight U.S. planes

Military and civilians in Hanoi, Haiphong, Son La, and Thanh Hoa, on the 9th and 10th, shot down a total of six invading U.S. planes in the battle against U.S. air pirates. On the 10th, the military and civilians of Hanoi alone shot down two U.S. fighter jets. Additionally, it was reported that the military and civilians of Vinh Linh and Quang Binh provinces shot down one invading U.S. plane each on the 3rd and 5th.

Pathet Lao radio station condemns Phoumi's cover-up of U.S. crimes

Recently, the Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary condemning Phoumi's attempt to cover up the crimes of U.S. air pirates bombing the liberation zones in Laos. The commentary pointed out that this further exposed Phoumi's treacherous and harmful nature.

The commentary stated that according to a report by the United Press International, U.S. military leaders recently admitted that the U.S. Air Force has been bombing Laotian territory for over three years.

Phoumi hurriedly came out to "correct" the statement, claiming that the U.S. Air Force did not bomb or strafe Laos, and that the bombing of the liberation zones was carried out by the right-wing faction of Laos. The role of the U.S. Air Force in Laos is merely to "assist" its puppets in "reconnaissance."

Cambodian Ministry of Information condemns Thailand for serving U.S. aggression against Cambodia

The Ministry of Information of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued a statement on the 9th, condemning the Thai reactionary regime for actively participating in the despicable plot initiated and directed by the United States to slander Cambodia, serving U.S. aggression against Cambodia. Recently, the Bangkok radio station, mimicking the tone of the U.S. propaganda machine, falsely claimed that there are North Vietnamese forces stationed within Cambodia, and threatened that Thailand believes it "must increase its military strength" to "counter" the so-called "communist threat" from Cambodia.

The Ministry of Information of the Kingdom of Cambodia stated that the malicious propaganda of the Bangkok radio station is a groundless fabrication.

West German workers strike against capitalists' wage cuts

On the 8th, 1,000 vehicle manufacturing workers in Cologne, West Germany, went on strike to protest the capitalists' decision to cut wages by 10%. Five hundred striking workers also held a protest demonstration in front of the headquarters of the West German monopoly capitalist company, Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz.

In North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, 5,600 construction workers have been on strike for two months since July 10, the longest strike since the war, to protest the capitalists' further wage cuts.

The annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress, controlled by the Labour Party, concludes

The annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress, controlled by the Labour Party, was held from the 4th to the 8th in Brighton. Many representatives attending the conference, despite the suppression of the reactionary leaders of the Trades Union Congress, expressed dissatisfaction with the domestic and foreign policies of the Labour Party government.

At this moment when British imperialism is facing internal and external difficulties and crises, the reactionary leaders of the Trades Union Congress are doing their best to cover up the reactionary policies of the Labour Party government. They manipulated the conference to forcibly pass a resolution supporting the Labour Party government. However, many trade union representatives sharply criticized the Labour Party government's reactionary actions of following the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam and shifting financial and economic difficulties onto the working people.

    巴特寮电台谴责富马掩盖美帝罪行
    巴特寮电台最近发表评论，谴责富马为美国强盗飞机轰炸老挝解放区的罪行狡辩，并指出，这更加暴露了富马祸国殃民的面目。
    评论说，据美国合众国际社报道，美国的军事头目们最近招认了美国空军三年多以来一直在轰炸老挝的领土。
    富马匆忙地跑出来“更正”，说什么美国空军没有对老挝进行轰炸和扫射，对解放区进行轰炸的是老挝右派集团的空军。在老挝的美国空军的任务，只是“协助”它的走狗进行“侦察”。
    柬新闻部谴责泰国为美帝侵柬效劳
    柬埔寨王国政府新闻部九日发表声明，谴责泰国反动当局积极参与由美国发动和指挥的诬蔑柬埔寨的卑鄙勾当，为美国侵略柬埔寨效劳。曼谷电台最近学着美国宣传机器的腔调，胡说什么柬埔寨境内驻有越南北方部队，等等，并且威胁说，泰国认为“不得不增加军事力量”，以便“反击”所谓来自柬埔寨的“共产党威胁”。

    英国工党控制的职工大会，从四日到八日在布赖顿举行了年会。出席会议的许多代表不顾职工大会反动头目的压制，对工党政府的内外政策表示不满。
    在目前英帝国主义处于内外交困、危机重重的时刻，职工大会的反动头目们竭力替工党政府的反动政策涂脂抹粉。他们操纵会议，强行通过了一项表示支持工党政府的决议。但是，不少工会代表对工党政府追随美国侵越政策和为转嫁财政经济困难而向劳动人民开刀的反动行径，进行了尖锐的抨击。
