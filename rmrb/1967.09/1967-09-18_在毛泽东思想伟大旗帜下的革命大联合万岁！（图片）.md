In the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, long live the great revolutionary unity!

Great helmsman Chairman Mao guides the revolutionary course,
Hundreds of millions of people are full of spirit and high in morale,
Unite to form a mighty revolutionary army,
Bury the bourgeois headquarters thoroughly.

Workers, peasants, soldiers, and students unite closely,
Advance side by side,
The revolution is going well,
Production brings good news!

Closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment,
The great criticism is in full swing,
Concentrate firepower, concentrate targets,
Resolutely overthrow Liu Shaoqi!

The people's army is a great wall,
The people are an iron fortress;
The military and the people are united as one,
See who can defeat us?

Be a model for uniting the broad revolutionary masses,
Be a vanguard in promoting great revolutionary unity,
Most resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions,
In the great revolutionary unity, achieve new merits for the people.

    在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下的革命大联合万岁！
    伟大统帅毛主席指引着革命航向，
    亿万人民意气风发斗志昂扬，
    联合起来组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，
    把资产阶级司令部彻底埋葬。
    工农兵学团结紧，
    携手并肩向前进，
    革命搞得好，
    生产传喜讯！
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，
    革命大批判如火如荼，
    集中火力，集中目标，
    坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！
    人民军队是伟大长城，
    人民群众是铜墙铁壁；
    军民团结如一人，
    试看天下谁能敌？
    做团结广大革命群众的模范，
    当促进革命大联合的先锋，
    最坚决执行毛主席最新指示，
    在革命大联合中为人民立新功。		（本版由解放军报供稿）
