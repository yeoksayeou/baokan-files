Revolutionary Spirit Roars, Production Booms: Interim Reports from the Steel City of Anshan on the Eve of National Day

The production of steel ingots, pig iron, and steel slabs has seen the most significant increases in output, with noticeable improvements in quality.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, the largest steel industrial base in China, is experiencing a great situation in both revolution and production on the eve of National Day. Amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism, the tide of revolutionary unity surges forward. In recent days, production victories have been frequently reported, with steel ingots, pig iron, and steel slabs seeing the fastest increases in output and noticeable improvements in quality. The vast Anshan Steelworks area has been filled with the sound of drums and gongs, bustling with activity, and immersed in boundless joy. Revolutionary workers are full of spirit, their enthusiasm growing, and good deeds are continually emerging.

The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel have closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and launched a revolutionary criticism. They have turned the Anshan Steelworks area into a battlefield for criticizing Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan and Anshan Steel. Many units' revolutionary workers have raised the banner of revolutionary unity in the revolutionary criticism, implementing revolutionary unity according to administrative departments. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," striving to be pioneers in revolution and models in production. The revolutionary workers of the "three brothers" blast furnaces, Number 9, Number 5, and Number 3, to increase the pig iron output of Number 5 blast furnace, they pooled their wisdom, thought of ways, and came up with ideas. Despite the high temperatures of over a thousand degrees, they took various effective measures to keep the furnace running smoothly and finally achieved their goal. To increase the output of Number 9 blast furnace, they worked together and performed "surgery" on the blast furnace. On the furnace top, several dozen meters high, they were not afraid of the interference of gas, did not fear the sand blowing into their faces, and did not mind the sweat dripping down their backs. They completed the work planned for two days in just two hours. Due to the revolutionary workers of these three blast furnaces implementing the principle of helping each other and learning from each other, the pig iron output of the three blast furnaces has increased significantly in the past five days compared to the previous ten days, with a quality qualification rate of one hundred percent.

The three steel plants of Anshan Steel, with their furnaces roaring, present a pleasant scene. The revolutionary workers of the leading Second Steel Plant have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and further launched a revolutionary criticism. They have invested the boundless enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution into production, striving to produce more and better steel for the country. Some workers have voluntarily organized production assault teams, going wherever there are difficulties to overcome obstacles and create new records of fast steelmaking.

The revolutionary workers of the First Rolling Mill have regarded rolling an extra piece of steel as adding a force to the Chinese and world revolution. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they have achieved revolutionary unity throughout the factory, concentrating their strength into a fist, and rolling steel slabs at the fastest speed and highest efficiency. In recent days, they have continuously created new daily production records. Now, the large number of steel slabs they have rolled are being continuously transported to Chongqing, Shenyang, and other places, strongly supporting the production of various departments on the industrial front.

Many factory and mine revolutionary workers have followed Chairman Mao's great directive of "thrift for revolution," exhibiting the high sense of responsibility of the working class in production, being meticulous and thrifty everywhere, and achieving production without neglecting thrift. The workers of the coal washing workshop of Anshan Steel Chemical Plant, where Lei Feng used to work, have taken Lei Feng's heroic deeds as an example, paying attention to the thrift of every bit of coal. They never let go of a broom, picking up coal before and after work, and have saved the country more than twenty tons of coal in just one month.

Inspired by the great news of Chairman Mao's recent inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel have resolutely declared: In the last quarter of this year, they will more closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, use revolutionary criticism as a driving force, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and with the fastest speed, highest output, best quality, and lowest cost, produce pig iron, steel ingots, and steel materials for the country. They will make new and greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and vow to turn Anshan Steel into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    革命轰轰烈烈　生产热气腾腾
    国庆前夕钢都鞍山频传捷报
　　钢锭、生铁、钢坯的产量提高得最快，质量也有明显的提高
    据新华社鞍山二十七日电　国庆节前夕，我国最大的钢铁工业基地鞍山，革命、生产呈现一派大好形势。在革命大批判的高潮中，革命大联合的洪流滚滚向前，连日来生产捷报频传，其中钢锭、生铁、钢坯的产量提高得最快，质量也有明显的提高。广阔的鞍钢厂区，最近几天锣鼓喧天，热气腾腾，沉浸在无限欢乐之中。广大革命职工个个精神焕发，干劲越来越足，好人好事不断涌现。
    鞍钢广大革命职工紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，展开革命大批判，把鞍钢厂区变成了批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山、鞍钢代理人的战场。许多单位的革命职工在革命大批判中，高举革命大联合的旗帜，按行政部门实行革命大联合。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，争当革命的闯将，生产的模范。被称为高炉“三兄弟”的九号、五号、三号高炉的革命职工，为了使五号高炉增加生铁产量，他们集思广益，想办法，出主意，冒着上千度的高温，采取各种有效措施，使炉况顺行，终于胜利地达到了目的。为了提高九号高炉的产量，他们同心协力，给高炉动了“手术”。在高达几十米的炉顶上，他们不怕瓦斯气的干扰，不惧大量风砂扑脸，不顾高温汗流浃背，在两个小时内就完成了原计划两天的工作。由于这三座高炉的革命职工实行一炉有事大家帮，一炉先进众炉赶，近五天来三座高炉的生铁产量比前十天有了大幅度的提高，质量合格率连续达到百分之百。
    炉火旺盛的鞍钢三座炼钢厂，更是一片喜人景象。跑在前边的第二炼钢厂革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步展开了革命的大批判。他们把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲投入生产，为国家大炼钢、炼好钢。有的工人主动组织了生产突击队，那里有困难，就到那里去突击，解决了许多障碍生产的关键，创造了快速炼钢的新纪录。
    第一初轧厂的革命职工，把多轧一块钢，看作是为中国革命和世界革命增添一份力量。他们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神实现了全厂革命的大联合，把力量集中起来，形成一个拳头，用最快的速度、最大的效率多轧钢坯，连日来不断创造出日产量新纪录。现在，他们轧出的大量钢坯，正源源不断地运往重庆、沈阳等地，有力地支援工业战线各部门的生产。
    许多厂矿的革命职工，遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，在生产中发扬了工人阶级的高度责任感，处处精打细算，做到了生产不忘节约。鞍钢化工总厂洗煤车间雷锋生前所在班的工人，时时处处以雷锋的英雄事迹为榜样，注意煤炭的点滴节约。他们手不离扫帚，班前拣，班后扫，从不放掉一块落地煤。这样，全班日积月累，仅近一个月里，就给国家节约煤炭二十多吨。
    鞍钢广大革命职工，在毛主席最近视察了华北、中南和华东地区的特大喜讯的鼓舞下，坚决表示：要在今年最后的一个季度里，更加紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，以革命大批判为动力，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，以最快的速度，最高的产量，最好的质量，最低的成本，为国家生产生铁、钢锭和钢材，为无产阶级文化大革命做出更新、更大的贡献，誓把鞍钢办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
