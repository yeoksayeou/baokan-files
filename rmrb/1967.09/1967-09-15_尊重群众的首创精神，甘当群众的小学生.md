We followed Chairman Mao's instructions and went to Tianjin's Yan'an Middle School to carry out military and political training. During the training process, we deeply felt that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, consciously standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, daring to take the lead, and wholeheartedly supporting the mass movement, can we successfully complete the military training mission.

After nearly a month of military and political training, the revolutionary teachers and students, with the struggle between the two lines as the key, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and in the joint struggle of denouncing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, generally raised their consciousness, distinguished between enemies and friends, and under the premise of a unified direction, urgently demanded unity. At that time, several organizations proposed to unite through combat groups, and we supported this. However, due to some leaders of the combat groups being selfish, it was not successful. At this time, the revolutionary youngsters of Class 9, Grade 2, first proposed the initiative to "unify the revolution based on teaching classes." As soon as the big-character poster appeared, it caused a sensation throughout the school and also attracted our attention. We believed that it was in line with the general direction and Mao Zedong Thought, and should be firmly supported. But at this time, selfish thoughts also emerged. We thought, haven't we seen other schools "unify the revolution based on teaching classes"? Is this the right path? If we make a mistake, it will be a big mistake. Why take this risk? So, the word "wait" appeared in our minds. Let's wait for others to pave the way, and then we can follow.

Should we respect the masses' initiative and firmly support new things, or should we wait for others to create successful experiences and then follow? We studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we believed that to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. The revolutionary youngsters listen to Chairman Mao's words, fear neither heaven nor earth, and have created a new path of unifying the revolution based on teaching classes. What reason do we have not to support their revolutionary actions and not to clear the way for this new thing? Therefore, we firmly supported this initiative.

After we expressed our support, the broad masses of teachers and students responded strongly and enthusiastically supported this initiative; however, there were also some people who opposed it, and some even came to our doorstep, pointing at us and saying, "You support the big-character poster of Class 9, Grade 2. Do you know what crime this is? This is sabotaging the Cultural Revolution!"

Hearing this, we felt great pressure and had intense inner struggles. Is this path correct? We studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said, "The growth of any new thing is bound to be full of twists and turns." "There is no straight road in the world. We must be prepared to take the winding road and not seek easy gains." How should we deal with the twists and turns in the growth process of this new thing? We mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students throughout the school to hold a great debate. The truth became clearer through debate. In the debate, we helped everyone repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, overcome selfishness, and eliminate small-groupism, individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts. The broad revolutionary teachers and students grasped Mao Zedong Thought and firmly believed in unifying the revolution based on teaching classes. They said well, "We have Chairman Mao to guide us, and the People's Liberation Army to support us. We will definitely walk this path!" Under the joint efforts of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, the school quickly achieved a great revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core and teaching classes as the base.

How should we deal with the few students who opposed this great unity? At that time, some people wanted to drive them out of the school. We and the revolutionary teachers and students, with this question in mind, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will definitely reflect their ideological consciousness. They will definitely express themselves in political and ideological issues in various ways. We should not use suppression to prevent them from expressing themselves, but let them express themselves and, at the same time, debate with them and make appropriate criticisms when they express themselves." Through study, everyone realized that the masses' understanding of a matter takes time, and their understanding of great unity is insufficient, which is temporary. We should wholeheartedly help them raise their consciousness. We did not suppress those with different opinions but often had heart-to-heart talks with them, studied Chairman Mao's works, sought their opinions, and made appropriate criticisms of their wrong opinions. Under the enthusiastic help of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, some students raised their consciousness and returned to the ranks of great unity.

Chairman Mao said, "Any party, any individual, is bound to make mistakes. We demand fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we demand correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." Carrying out the Cultural Revolution and military training is a new subject for us, and it is like learning to swim while swimming. Therefore, it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings and mistakes in the work. The key is how to view the shortcomings and mistakes in our work. We felt that we must dare to take the lead, humbly listen to different opinions, strictly examine ourselves, and correct mistakes. The sooner we correct, the more proactive we are; the later we correct, the less proactive we are; if we do not correct, we are not proactive.

When we first entered the school, we did not fully understand the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary youngsters, saw more of their shortcomings, and often focused on trivial issues. In this way, the revolutionary teachers and students became distant from us; some students even remembered the words and deeds of the military comrades and waited for an opportunity to "settle accounts." The military comrades also had a sense of difficulty and worked passively. With these problems in mind, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on military training and his teachings on dealing with mass movements, and corrected our attitude towards the revolutionary youngsters. We took learning from the revolutionary youngsters and being willing to be their students as an important measure to carry out military training well. We often found the shortcomings and mistakes in our work through various means and channels and corrected them in a timely manner. We often used Chairman Mao's teachings and superior instructions to examine our work and find shortcomings; when superiors praised us, we summarized our work and found shortcomings; when we saw advanced experiences, we compared our work and found shortcomings; from opposing opinions, we analyzed and studied to find our shortcomings; from the reflections of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, we found our shortcomings; from the leaflets opposing us, we also paid attention to whether we had any shortcomings. Through these "six finds," we timely discovered the loopholes and weak links in our work and conducted a serious analysis, strict examination, and firm correction of the shortcomings and mistakes we found. For example, once students brought back a leaflet from the street opposing the temporary Cultural Revolution members of Yan'an Middle School. We analyzed it and found that when the school's temporary Cultural Revolution was formed, due to the urgency of time, some members had low prestige among the masses, so we immediately proposed to supplement the members and strengthen the leading cadre.

When comrades from many places came to learn from the experience of Yan'an Middle School, how should we treat ourselves? In the midst of praise, we decided to conduct a rectification campaign. Should it be a "closed-door rectification" or an "open-door rectification"? Everyone unanimously agreed to conduct an open-door rectification and let the masses examine our work. Because only by conducting an open-door rectification and widely listening to the masses' criticisms can we touch the soul, correct mistakes, and work more proactively. Each company conducted an open-door rectification, widely listened to opinions from all sides, and publicly and sincerely made self-criticisms to the revolutionary teachers and students based on the opinions raised by the students. The revolutionary teachers and students were moved to tears while listening to our cadres' self-examination and excitedly said, "The People's Liberation Army is truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers, models of studying Chairman Mao's works, models of serving the people, and models of self-criticism." During the rectification, students reflected that our work was not deep enough. We then went deep into the masses, carried out heart-to-heart talks, timely understood the situation, grasped the active thoughts, strengthened political and ideological work, and mobilized revolutionary teachers and students and cadres to do a good job of ideological work. We passed on the experience of the army's political and ideological work to the revolutionary teachers and students, guiding students to carry out "one helps one" and "one red pair" activities. We also often held study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works with revolutionary teachers and students. In this way, the relationship between the military and the people became closer, and the revolutionary teachers and students had no words they did not say to us and no matters they did not discuss with us. Under the influence of the army, the revolutionary teachers and students also actively carried out extensive rectification activities, overcame various non-proletarian thoughts, greatly enhanced their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, further launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, further consolidated the revolutionary great unity, and promoted the revolutionary great criticism.

    尊重群众的首创精神，甘当群众的小学生	中国人民解放军驻天津部队军训九团党委会
    我们遵照毛主席的指示，到天津延安中学执行军政训练任务。我们在军训过程中深深体会到：只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自觉地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，“敢”字当头，满腔热情地对待群众运动，才能很好地完成军训任务。
    经过近一个月的军政训练，广大革命师生以两条路线斗争为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，在控诉、批判资产阶级反动路线的共同斗争中，普遍提高了觉悟，分清了敌我友，在大方向一致的前提下，迫切要求联合起来。当时有几个组织提议以战斗组搞联合，我们支持了，但是由于一些战斗组领导人头脑里“私”字作怪，因此没有成功。正在这时，二年级九班革命小将第一个提出了“以教学班为基础实现革命大联合”的倡议。大字报一出现，就轰动了全校，也引起了我们的重视。我们认为它符合大方向，符合毛泽东思想，应该坚决支持。但这时私心杂念也出现了，我们想，还没有见到其它学校“以教学班为基础实现革命大联合”的先例，走这条路对不对呢？走错了要犯大错误，何必冒这个风险呢？于是，头脑里出现了一个“等”字，还是等别人创出路来，咱们再跟着人家走吧！
    到底应该是尊重群众的首创精神，坚决支持新生事物，还是等着别人创造出成功的经验自己再跟着干呢？我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。根据毛主席的教导，我们认为要站在毛主席的革命路线一边，就要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。革命小将听毛主席的话，天不怕，地不怕，创出了以教学班为基础实现革命大联合的新路子，我们还有啥理由不支持他们的革命行动，不为这一新生事物鸣锣开道呢？于是坚决地支持了这一倡议。
    我们表态后，广大师生产生了强烈的反响，纷纷响应这一倡议；但是，也有一些人反对，有的甚至找上门来指着我们说：“你们支持二年级九班的大字报，你们知道这是什么罪过吗？这是破坏文化大革命！”
    听了这些，我们感到压力很大，思想斗争非常激烈。这条路子到底对不对呢？我们又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的”。“世界上没有直路，要准备走曲折的路，不要贪便宜。”怎样对待这新生事物成长过程中的艰难曲折呢？我们发动全校革命师生展开了一场大辩论。真理越辩越明。在辩论中，我们帮助大家反复学习了毛主席著作，破私立公，克服了小团体主义、个人主义等各种非无产阶级思想。广大革命师生掌握了毛泽东思想，坚定了以教学班为基础实现革命大联合的信心和决心。他们说得好：“我们有毛主席指路，有解放军撑腰，这条路我们走定了！”在广大革命师生的一致努力下，这个学校很快实现了以左派为核心，以教学班为基础的全校革命大联合。
    怎样对待那些反对这种大联合的少数同学呢？当时，有些人想把他们赶出校门。我们和革命师生一起，带着这个问题，重温毛主席的教导：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。我们不应当用压制的办法不让他们表现，而应当让他们表现，同时在他们表现的时候，和他们辩论，进行适当的批评。”经过学习，大家认识到，群众认识一个事物要有一个过程，他们对大联合的意义认识不足，这是暂时的。我们要满腔热情地帮助他们提高认识。我们没有压制持不同观点的人，而是多次找他们谈心，学毛主席著作，征求意见，并对他们的错误意见进行适当的批评。在广大革命师生热情帮助下，有一些同学提高了认识，回到了大联合的行列。
    毛主席说：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”搞文化大革命，搞军训，对我们来说，这是一个新课题，是在游泳中学游泳。因而，工作中产生一些缺点错误是难免的。关键是怎样看待我们工作中的缺点错误。我们体会到：必须敢字当头，虚心听取不同意见，严格检查自己，坚决改正错误，早改早主动，晚改晚主动，不改不主动。
    我们刚进校时，对革命小将的革命造反精神理解不够，看小将的缺点多，抓住枝节问题上“纲”多。这样革命师生对我们就疏远了；有的同学还记部队同志的言行，待机“算账”。部队的同志也产生了畏难情绪，工作很被动。我们带着这些问题，反复学习了毛主席关于军训的指示和对待群众运动的教导，端正了对待革命小将的态度。我们把向革命小将学习，甘当小学生，作为搞好军训的一项重要措施。我们经常通过各种方式，各种渠道，找我们工作中的缺点和错误，及时纠正。我们经常用毛主席的教导、上级的指示，来检查自己的工作，找缺点；上级表扬时，总结工作找缺点；看到了先进经验时，对照自己的工作找缺点；从反面意见中，分析研究找自己的缺点；从广大革命师生的反映中，找自己的缺点；从反对我们的传单中，也注意找自己有没有缺点。通过这“六找”，就及时地发现自己工作中的漏洞和薄弱环节，并且对找出的缺点错误，进行认真分析，严格检查，坚决改正。比如，有一次同学们从街上拿回一张反对延安中学临时文革成员的传单。我们一分析，原来校临时文革产生时，由于时间仓促，个别成员在群众中威信不高，于是立即提议补充了委员，加强了领导班子。
    在许多地方的同志都来学习延安中学的经验时，我们应当怎样对待自己呢？在一片赞扬声中，我们决定进行一次整风。是“关门整风”还是“开门整风”？大家一致认为要开门整风，让群众来检查我们的工作。因为只有开门整风，最广泛地听取群众的批评意见，才能触及灵魂，改正错误，工作才能更主动。各连普遍进行开门整风，广泛听取了各方面的意见，并针对同学们提出的意见，向革命师生做了公开的诚恳的自我批评。革命师生听我们干部检查时，感动得边听边流泪，激动地说：“解放军真不愧是毛主席的好战士，是学习毛主席著作的模范，为人民服务的模范，自我批评的模范。”整风中，同学们反映我们的工作不够深入。我们就深入群众，开展谈心活动，及时了解情况，掌握活思想，加强了政治思想工作，并发动革命师生、骨干分子做好思想工作，把部队作政治思想工作的经验传到革命师生中去，指导学生开展“一帮一”
  “一对红”活动。我们还经常和革命师生召开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。这样，军民关系更加密切了，革命师生无话不对我们说，无事不对我们谈。在部队的影响下，革命师生也自觉地展开了广泛的整风活动，克服各种非无产阶级思想，大大增强了革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，进一步巩固了革命的大联合，推动了革命的大批判。
