Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved magnificent victories that have shaken the world. In this favorable situation, as hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses launch a vigorous campaign of criticism against China's Khrushchev, we review the struggle of the past year, study Chairman Mao's teachings on combining a dauntless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude, and learn from the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms and best student of Chairman Mao, on strengthening revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. We feel more confident and more affectionate.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" He teaches us to "combine revolutionary spirit with practical spirit." Chairman Mao's brilliant works and his decades of leading the revolutionary people to achieve one glorious victory after another in political and military campaigns are the most resolute and thorough examples of combining the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat with the most scientific, flexible, and ingenious strategies and tactics of struggle. They are the highest example for all revolutionaries in the world and the fundamental guarantee for all revolutionary victories.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings and the struggle practices of tens of millions of revolutionary masses, has issued a call to arms to the revolutionary masses to strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. He has used the simplest and most straightforward language to summarize profound truths, summarize the worldview and methodology of dialectical and historical materialism, reflect the objective laws of recognizing and transforming the world, and point out the qualities that proletarian revolutionaries should have. This is another outstanding example of creatively applying Mao Zedong Thought in the new situation.

The revolutionary army of the proletariat must possess revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline in order to firmly and correctly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to transform the great thought of Mao Zedong into a great material force, to be both daring in revolution and skilled in revolution, both daring in victory and skilled in victory, to thoroughly defeat all class enemies, and to achieve the greatest victories with the smallest sacrifices.

Whether one possesses revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline is an important criterion for distinguishing proletarian revolutionaries from petty-bourgeois revolutionaries. Proletarian revolutionaries consciously take the "three spirits" as their guiding principles, not only as a guarantee for defeating the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but also as a significant and far-reaching measure for fostering a new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought in the storm of revolution and ensuring that the proletarian cause will never change color.

Revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline are an inseparable organic whole, with revolutionary spirit being the primary and guiding factor.

Marx said: "Revolution is the locomotive of history." Chairman Mao said: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development or to overthrow the ruling class of reactionaries and enable the people to seize power." He also said: "'To dare to die, to dare to kill,' we must have this spirit of daring when we struggle for socialism and communism." Today, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. Revolutionary rebellion is the spirit of this brilliant era.

Revolution is rebellion. Criticism, struggle, and revolution are the soul of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Reactionary things will not fall unless you fight them. Only by destroying the old world can you build a new world. First destroy, then construct. First chaos, then order. Without revolution, everything is empty talk. Every revolutionary must have the courage to fear neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts, to dare to climb mountains of blades and cross seas of fire. With this revolutionary spirit, you can overcome all enemies. Towards reactionary, decadent, and declining things, towards the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, towards imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, you dare to rebel against them, to overthrow them, and to sweep them all into the dustbin of history, without compromising, compromising, or reforming. With this revolutionary spirit, towards the great leader Chairman Mao, you will have boundless love, boundless faith, boundless admiration, and boundless loyalty. Towards those who dare to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter how big a "giant" they are, we will be mortal enemies with them and resolutely overthrow them. This is the fundamental criterion that distinguishes proletarian revolutionaries from opportunists and old and new revisionists, and it is the fundamental criterion that distinguishes the revolutionary masses from the conservatives in the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary spirit has a clear class nature. Revolution, first of all, is to clarify whose command to overthrow. Class and class struggle are the root of all social phenomena in class society. Without the perspective of class struggle, there can be no revolutionary spirit. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, focusing on striking at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, aiming at these most important and dangerous enemies from beginning to end. In considering and handling all problems, we must serve this great direction. Only by firmly grasping the great direction of the struggle can we stand firmly on the side of the proletariat and have true proletarian revolutionary spirit. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, and fight indiscriminately, mixing enemies with ourselves, being right-wing conservative, or mixing ourselves with enemies, appearing "left" but actually right, we will make directional errors. If the direction is wrong, the position is wrong, everything is wrong, and there can be no true revolutionary spirit. This so-called "revolutionary spirit" not only fails to hit the real enemies but also can be used by the enemies to do things that hurt friends and please enemies, causing harm to the revolutionary cause.

The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat has the tenacity and thoroughness of perseverance. The proletarian revolution is the most thorough revolution in human history. Chairman Mao teaches us: After seizing power, "this is only the first step of the long march." "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." This thorough revolutionary spirit, manifested in the Cultural Revolution, is to criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party not only by pulling them down from their horses and making them stand aside but also by thoroughly criticizing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, exposing their poison and influence, and uprooting the social basis for capitalist restoration. At present, we must follow the strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, carry out the great criticism, promote, realize, and consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution. This task is much more arduous and complex than seizing power organizationally. Those who, due to the victories already achieved and the change in their previously suppressed status, think that the revolution has reached its end and have the emotion of stopping and not seeking progress; those who pursue fame and wealth, are eager to fight "internal wars," and are not interested in the great criticism of the revolution; those who were once daring horsemen but have now become idle wanderers, sitting around without using their brains, wandering east and west, are all manifestations of petty-bourgeois vacillation and are fundamentally different from the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. If they do not change, they are not proletarian revolutionaries but only fellow travelers of the revolution. The lessons of history are: without thorough revolutionary spirit, the revolution will be half-hearted, the previous achievements will be in vain, and the victories won by the blood and sacrifices of thousands and thousands of people will be lost in an instant. Proletarian revolutionaries must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to death, showing no mercy to frozen snakes and drowning dogs, and continuing to advance and attack the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly criticizing the revolution, and thoroughly reforming the units, to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat must also be manifested in daring to overthrow the "self" in one's mind, in transforming the objective world while transforming one's subjective world. Comrade Lin Biao instructs: "Revolution also means overthrowing oneself. Without overthrowing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." The "self" is incompatible with the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. True proletarian revolutionaries are not only heroes who smash the old world but also pioneers who overthrow the "self" and establish the "public."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, capitalist restoration will be possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will bring eternal peace. Be vigilant and never relax." We proletarian revolutionaries must deeply understand this great strategic thought of Chairman Mao. To defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must continue to revolutionize and fight on without end, until communism is victorious throughout the world, and forever preserve the revolutionary spirit.

To dare to revolutionize, one must also be good at revolutionizing. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most acute and effective weapon of the proletariat is only one, that is, a serious and fighting scientific attitude." "Not only must we have the courage to overcome everything, but we must also have the ability to control the entire change and development of the war." "Not only must we propose tasks, but we must also solve the problem of how to complete the tasks." This ability and method come only from the science of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which means not only having revolutionary spirit but also having scientific attitude.

Scientific attitude is to correctly understand the laws of objective things and act according to the laws of the development of things. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest revolutionary science, a summary of the experience of class struggle at home and abroad, a crystallization of human wisdom, and a universally true principle that has been tested by long-term struggle and is invincible. The most fundamental scientific attitude is to act honestly according to Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it.

Scientific attitude is to start from the actual situation and seek truth from facts. The class struggle in the Cultural Revolution is extremely complex. The bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev is secretly set up within the organs of proletarian dictatorship. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party all wear the cloak of old revolutionaries, wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, and some are in the foreground while others are in the background. For their current survival and future development, they deliberately distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, and even spread rumors, incite, and deceive the masses, diverting the direction of the struggle. Under such circumstances, to strictly distinguish between the two classes, the two headquarters, and the two types of different nature contradictions, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not rely on subjective imagination, not on temporary enthusiasm, not on dead books, but on the objective existence of facts, to thoroughly possess materials, and under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, to draw correct conclusions from these materials." Subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality are the great enemies of scientific attitude.

Scientific attitude is to seriously carry out investigations and research. This is to fully rely on the masses, to walk the mass line, and to do the basic work of the revolution well. Only when the situation is clear can the resolve be great and the method be correct. To expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must rely on investigations and research and class analysis; to overthrow, smash, and criticize them, we must also rely on investigations and research and class analysis. The enemy is not afraid of shouting down and dismissing, but is afraid of exposing their true colors, revealing their counter-revolutionary crimes in broad daylight, and criticizing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Our army, with the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries," must support the real leftists, and must also deeply enter the masses, use the method of class analysis, and conduct thorough investigations and research. Those who do not conduct repeated and in-depth analysis and research, but make absolute affirmative or absolute negative conclusions, or first determine the nature and then collect materials, or "strike first and talk later," or do not distinguish between the main and the secondary, the phenomenon and the essence, or do not look at problems comprehensively and historically, but grab one thing and make a big deal out of it, are all not in line with scientific attitude.

Scientific attitude is to have an honest attitude. "In the world, to accomplish a few things, an honest attitude is essential." Proletarian revolutionaries must be humble, cautious, not arrogant, and not impatient. Always maintain the spirit of being a good student. Old revolutionary comrades, in particular, must humbly learn from the revolutionary youngsters who have emerged and achieved immortal merits in the Cultural Revolution. Proletarian revolutionaries must be able to withstand the test of difficulties and setbacks, not be discouraged, not be discouraged, and be unyielding; they must also be able to withstand the test of achievements and victories, not be arrogant because of victory, not regard themselves as heroes, and especially be able to correctly treat their own shortcomings and mistakes. If there are mistakes, they must be brave enough to criticize themselves, admit mistakes early, correct mistakes early, and the faster the better. Without this scientific attitude, not only can the revolution not be carried out to the end, but it may also turn to the opposite side and even repeat the mistakes of the capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Scientific attitude is to think about problems and do meticulous work. "To eliminate the thick subjectivity in our Party, we must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and cultivate the habit of analysis." Correct thinking comes from the three great revolutionary practices, but only after serious thinking, "eliminating the dross and taking the essence, eliminating the false and retaining the true, from this to that, from the surface to the inside," can there be a leap in cognition. The more you think, the wiser you become. Without investigation and research, or only investigation without research, or only paying attention to form and going through the motions, or being satisfied with superficial clamor, or not doing meticulous work, are all not scientific attitudes.

Scientific attitude and revolutionary spirit are complementary and interdependent. "A thorough materialist is fearless." Only with a high degree of revolutionary spirit and a clear proletarian standpoint can one eliminate the reactionary influence of the bourgeoisie and the limitations of small producers, correctly understand objective things, and strictly act according to science. Only with a high degree of scientific attitude can one fully exert the power of revolutionary spirit. "Without a scientific attitude... it is called no party spirit, or incomplete party spirit." "Only a scientific attitude and a sense of responsibility can lead our nation to the path of liberation," ensuring that we have the confidence to achieve the purpose of the revolution.

Having revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, we must also emphasize organizational discipline. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Unified discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory." "Strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible." "We must enhance discipline and resolutely execute orders and policies... and not allow any phenomenon of violating discipline to exist." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses that have been fully mobilized must form a vast revolutionary army, with the orderly steps of the proletarian iron army, launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and seize the final victory, which must have a high degree of organizational discipline. Otherwise, if everyone acts on their own, it will be a loose sand, without combat effectiveness, and it will be impossible to talk about revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.

The organizational discipline of the proletariat is concentrated in the unconditional implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the policies and principles formulated by Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. An organization or individual is limited by their level of thought and scope of practice and cannot have a comprehensive understanding of the essence of things and the general laws of the movement of contradictions. Only our great helmsman, the greatest genius of the contemporary world, Chairman Mao, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao can have a high vision, a comprehensive grasp, and the most profound and comprehensive revelation of the internal connections and development laws of things, make wise decisions, and implement great strategic command. Chairman Mao's line, principles, and policies are the concentrated expression of the most fundamental and long-term interests of the proletariat, the highest directive, and the highest authority. Departing from the highest directive will result in blind action like a blind man catching a fish, and the result will inevitably be failure. Therefore, for the highest directive, if understood, it must be executed; if not understood at the moment, it must also be resolutely executed. Only in this way can the revolutionary army of the proletariat have a unified will and unified action, and be invincible and unstoppable.

To strengthen organizational discipline, we must correctly understand and handle the relationship between democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline, and draw a clear line between counter-revolutionary discipline and revolutionary discipline, and between bourgeois reactionary authority and proletarian revolutionary authority. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the people's internal affairs, there must be no freedom, nor must there be no discipline; there must be no democracy, nor must there be no centralization. This unity of democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism." "The Communist Party not only needs democracy but especially needs centralization." The great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a means to smash the bourgeois restoration plot and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Slavery and anarchism are both enemies of democratic centralism. Slavery advocates blind obedience and does not speak of truth; anarchism opposes all leadership and all authority, similarly does not recognize truth, and their common ideological basis is bourgeois individualism, which is incompatible with the organizational discipline of the proletariat. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The danger of extreme democratization lies in damaging or even completely destroying the Party's organization, weakening or even completely destroying the Party's combat effectiveness, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, and thus causing the failure of the revolution." We proletarian revolutionaries must thoroughly smash the reactionary discipline of the bourgeoisie, resolutely uphold the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, thoroughly overthrow the authority of the bourgeoisie, resolutely establish the authority of the proletariat, and strengthen organizational discipline.

To strengthen organizational discipline, it is necessary to strictly report and request instructions. This is especially important for leading cadres. The unprecedented Cultural Revolution, we lack ideological preparation, often do not understand, and unconsciously use old ideas and methods to deal with new tasks of struggle, sometimes making mistakes without knowing it. Only by timely reporting and requesting instructions from Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters and obtaining instructions and help can we avoid or reduce mistakes. Never be self-righteous, self-smart, self-acting, or think that small things can be dealt with casually. Not reporting and requesting instructions will inevitably lead to serious mistakes and cause serious damage to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, strictly reporting and requesting instructions is a very important aspect of strengthening organizational discipline.

Organizational discipline based on a high degree of self-awareness is an important guarantee for fully exerting revolutionary spirit and achieving scientific attitude. Only the proletarian revolutionary army with strong organizational discipline can correctly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and be invincible.

The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and the conservative and vacillating spirit of the petty bourgeoisie, scientific attitude and subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality, organizational discipline and freedom and disorder, anarchism, are the reflections of the two worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. To strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, it is ultimately a matter of transforming worldviews.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." The essential difference between the two worldviews is whether it is for "public" or "private." With "public" as the top priority, selflessly and fearlessly, one can dare to rebel and dare to pioneer, dare to seek truth from facts, dare to uphold truth, and be a model of executing policies and disciplines, and have strong revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. On the contrary, with "private" as the top priority, "three spirits" are all absent. Selfishness will inevitably make one timid, fearing this and that, right-wing conservative, not daring to revolutionize, not daring to thoroughly revolutionize, or vacillating and recklessly charging; it will inevitably not dare to seek truth from facts, not dare to face objective truth, and words and deeds will not be consistent; it will inevitably develop cliquism, factionalism, opportunism, extreme democratization, and destroy revolutionary organizational discipline. Proletarian revolutionaries must, in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, overthrow the "private" and establish the "public," and transform worldviews.

The most fundamental key to overthrowing the "private" and establishing the "public" is to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois ideology in one's mind and thoroughly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We proletarian revolutionaries must follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as an object of revolution." Honestly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Constantly eliminate non-proletarian thoughts from one's mind, eliminate interference from the "left" and the right, and consciously strengthen the revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. Hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism, promote, realize, and consolidate the great alliance and the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution, unite more than 95% of the masses and cadres, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Following the course set by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, forever ride the wind and waves, and advance bravely!

    加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利
　　李天焕
　　（一）
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，取得震撼世界的辉煌胜利的大好形势下，在亿万革命群众，向中国的赫鲁晓夫展开轰轰烈烈的革命大批判的高潮中，回顾一年多来的斗争实践，学习毛主席关于必须把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度相结合的教导，学习毛主席的亲密战友、最好的学生林副主席关于加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的指示，更加感到信心百倍，无限亲切。
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”教导我们要“把革命气概和实际精神结合起来。”毛主席一系列的光耀万代的著作，和他几十年来统帅革命人民，取得一个又一个政治战役和军事战役光辉胜利的伟大实践，就是最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级革命精神，和最科学、最灵活、最巧妙的斗争策略和斗争艺术相结合的最卓越的典范，是全世界革命者最崇高的榜样，是一切革命胜利的源泉和根本保证。
    林副主席在无产阶级文化大革命中，根据毛主席历来的教导，和千百万革命群众的斗争实践，向无产阶级革命派发出了加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的战斗号召。他用最简明朴素的语言，概括了丰富深刻的道理，概括了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观和方法论，反映了认识世界和改造世界的客观规律，指出了无产阶级革命派应有的品质，是在新形势下创造性地活学活用毛泽东思想的又一个杰出的范例。
    无产阶级革命大军只有具备革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，才能坚定正确地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能把伟大的毛泽东思想转化为巨大的物质力量，才能既敢于革命，又善于革命，既敢于胜利，又善于胜利，彻底打倒一切阶级敌人，以最小最小最小的代价，换取最大最大最大的胜利。
    是否具有革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，是区别无产阶级革命家和小资产阶级革命家的重要标志。无产阶级革命派自觉地把“三性”作为自己行动的准则，不仅是战胜党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的重要保证，而且对于在革命的暴风雨中，造就用毛泽东思想武装起来的一代新人，保证无产阶级的江山永不变色，具有极大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。
    （二）
    革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，三者是不可分割的有机联系的整体，而首要的起主导作用的是革命性。
    马克思说：“革命是历史的火车头”。毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”又说：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”今天，世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，革命造反就是这个光辉时代的精神。
    革命就是造反。批判，斗争，革命，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的灵魂。反动的东西，你不打他就不倒。只有破坏旧世界，才能建设新世界。先破后立，先乱后治。不革命，一切都是空谈。每个革命者，必须具有天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯的顶天立地的英雄气概。有了这种革命精神，就能压倒一切敌人。对于反动、腐朽、没落的东西，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对于帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，就都敢造他们的反，革他们的命，统统把他们扫入历史的垃圾堆，而决不搞调和、折中和改良主义。有了这种革命精神，对伟大领袖毛主席，就会无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。对于胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线的家伙，不管他是什么“庞然大物”，我们都和他不共戴天，坚决把他打倒。这是无产阶级革命家区别于机会主义、新老修正主义者的根本标志，是文化大革命中无产阶级革命派区别于保守派的根本标志。
    革命性具有鲜明的阶级性。革命，首先要弄清革谁的命。阶级和阶级斗争是阶级社会所有社会现象的总根源。离开了阶级斗争的观点，就不可能有革命性。无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把矛头自始至终对准这些最主要、最危险的敌人，是斗争的大方向。我们考虑和处理一切问题，都必须服从这个大方向。牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，才是坚定地站稳了无产阶级的立场，才有真正的无产阶级的革命性。如果不分青红皂白，不分无产阶级还是资产阶级，不分无产阶级司令部还是资产阶级司令部，乱打一通，混敌为我，右倾保守，或者混我为敌，形“左”实右，就要犯方向的错误。方向错了，立场错了，一切都错了，就不可能有真正的革命性。这种所谓“革命性”，不仅打不到真正的敌人，而且会被敌人所利用，做出亲者痛、仇者快的事，给革命事业造成危害。
    无产阶级的革命性具有坚韧不拔的彻底性。无产阶级革命是人类历史上最彻底的革命。毛主席教导我们：夺取了政权，“只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”这种彻底革命的精神，表现在文化大革命中，就是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不仅把他们拉下马，让他们靠边站，而且必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒和影响，挖掉资本主义复辟的社会基础。当前，就是要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，开展革命大批判，促进、实现、巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。这个任务，比从组织上夺权，要艰巨、复杂得多。那种由于已经取得的胜利，由于原来遭受压抑的地位已经改变，以为革命已经到底，而“停顿起来不求进步的情绪”；那种追求名利，热衷于打“内战”，对革命的大批判不感兴趣；那种当日横刀纵马的闯将，却变成了坐不下来，不用脑子，东遛西串的“逍遥派”，都是小资产阶级摇摆性的表现，是和无产阶级的革命性根本不同的。如果不转变，就不是无产阶级革命派，只不过是革命的同路人。历史的教训是：没有彻底的革命性，革命就会半途而废，前功尽弃，千百万人流血牺牲得来的胜利，就会毁于一旦。无产阶级革命派，必须发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，决不怜惜冻僵的毒蛇和落水的恶狗，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要乘胜前进，穷追猛打，搞好革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    无产阶级的革命性，还要表现在敢于革自己头脑里“私”字的命，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。林副主席指示：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”“私”字同无产阶级的革命性是水火不相容的。真正的无产阶级革命派，既是砸烂旧世界的英雄，又是破“私”立“公”的先锋。
    毛主席教导我们：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”我们无产阶级革命派，要深刻领会毛主席这个伟大的战略思想，为了捍卫和巩固无产阶级专政，要不断革命，一往无前地斗下去，直到共产主义在全世界的胜利，永葆革命的青春。
    （三）
    敢于革命，还要善于革命。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。”“不但有压倒一切的勇气，而且有驾驭整个战争变化发展的能力。”“不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。”这个能力和方法，唯一的来源是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的科学，就是不仅要有革命性，而且必须具有科学性。
    科学性，就是正确认识客观事物的规律，并按照事物发展的规律办事。毛泽东思想是最高的革命科学，是国内外阶级斗争经验的总结，是人类智慧的结晶，是经过长期斗争考验的战无不胜的普遍真理。科学性，最根本的就是老老实实地按照毛泽东思想办事，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。
    科学性，就是从实际情况出发，实事求是。文化大革命中阶级斗争极其错综复杂，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，是隐蔽地设置在无产阶级专政机构内部的，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派都披着老革命的外衣，打着红旗反红旗，而且有的在台前有的在幕后。他们为了现在的生存以利将来的发展，故意颠倒是非，混淆黑白，甚至造谣生事，煽动和蒙蔽群众，转移斗争大方向。在这种情况下，要严格区分两个阶级、两个司令部、两类不同性质的矛盾，就必须按照毛主席的教导：“不凭主观想象，不凭一时的热情，不凭死的书本，而凭客观存在的事实，详细地占有材料，在马克思列宁主义一般原理的指导下，从这些材料中引出正确的结论。”主观性、片面性、表面性是科学性的大敌。
    科学性，就是要认真进行调查研究。这是充分依靠群众，大走群众路线，搞好革命的基本功。情况明，才能决心大，方法对。把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，要靠调查研究，阶级分析；把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭更要靠调查研究，阶级分析。敌人不怕空喊打倒、罢官，怕的是剥开他们的画皮，把他们的反革命罪行暴露在光天化日之下，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭。我军担负“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，要支持真正的左派，也必须深入群众，运用阶级分析的方法，作周密的调查研究。那种不作反复深入的分析研究，即做出绝对肯定或绝对否定的简单结论，甚至先定性后凑材料，“打了再说”，以及不分主流和支流，不分现象和本质，不全面地历史地看问题，抓住一时一事就大作文章，都是不符合科学性的。
    科学性，就是要有老实的态度。“在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”无产阶级革命派，必须谦虚，谨慎，不骄，不躁。永远保持甘当小学生的精神，虚心向群众学习。革命的老战士，尤其要虚心地向文化大革命中冲杀出来的、立下了不朽功勋的革命小将学习。无产阶级革命派，既要经得起困难和挫折的考验，不灰心，不泄气，百折不挠；又要经得起成绩和胜利的考验，不因胜利而骄傲，以功臣自居，尤其是要正确地对待自己的缺点错误。有了错误，就要勇于自我批评，早认错，早改错，改得越快越好。没有这种科学的态度，不仅不能革命到底，而且有可能走向反面，甚至重蹈党内走资本主义道路当权派的覆辙。
    科学性，就是要动脑筋想问题，做艰苦细致的工作。“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”正确的思想来源于三大革命实践，但是，只有经过认真思考，“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”，才能形成认识的飞跃。多想才能出智慧。不调查不研究，光调查不研究，图形式走过场，满足于表面上的轰轰烈烈，不作艰苦细致的工作，都不是科学的态度。
    科学性和革命性，是相辅相成、互为因果的。“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。有了高度的革命性，鲜明的无产阶级立场，才能排除资产阶级的反动影响和小生产者的局限性，正确地认识客观事物，严格地按照科学办事。有了高度的科学性，才能充分发挥革命性的威力。“没有科学的态度……就叫做没有党性，或叫做党性不完全。”“惟有科学的态度和负责的精神，能够引导我们民族到解放之路”，保证我们确有把握地达到革命的目的。

    有了革命性和科学性，还必须强调组织纪律性。毛主席教导我们：“统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”“加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”“必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策……不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，充分发动起来的亿万革命群众，要形成浩浩荡荡的革命队伍，以无产阶级铁军的整齐步伐，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起猛烈的攻击，夺取最后的胜利，必须有高度的组织纪律性。否则，各自为政，各行其是，就是一盘散沙，就没有战斗力，也就谈不上革命性和科学性。
    无产阶级的组织纪律性，集中地表现在要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，贯彻执行毛主席、林副主席和中央文革所制定的方针、政策。一个组织或个人，都受着思想水平和实践范围的限制，不可能通观全局，全面地认识事物的本质和矛盾运动的总的规律。只有我们伟大的舵手、当代最伟大的天才毛主席，和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，才能高瞻远瞩，统筹全局，最深刻、最全面地揭示事物内部的联系和发展的规律，做出英明的决策，实施伟大的战略指挥。毛主席的路线、方针、政策，是无产阶级最根本最长远利益的集中表现，是最高指示，最高权威。背离了最高指示，就会象“瞎子摸鱼”一样地盲目行动，其结果必然失败。因此，对最高指示，理解了要执行，一时不理解也要坚决执行。只有这样，无产阶级的革命大军才能有统一的意志、统一的行动，才能所向披靡，攻无不克。
    加强组织纪律性，要正确认识和处理民主和集中、自由和纪律的关系，划清反革命的组织纪律和革命的组织纪律、资产阶级反动权威和无产阶级革命权威的界限。毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”“共产党不但要民主，尤其要集中。”无产阶级专政下的大民主，是粉碎资产阶级的复辟阴谋，巩固无产阶级专政的手段。奴隶主义和无政府主义，都是民主集中制的敌人。奴隶主义主张盲从，不讲真理；无政府主义反对一切领导，反对一切权威，同样是不承认真理，其共同的思想基础，都是资产阶级个人主义，都是同无产阶级的组织纪律性不相容的。毛主席早就指出：“极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”我们无产阶级革命派，要彻底冲垮资产阶级反革命的纪律，坚决遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，要彻底打倒资产阶级的权威，坚决树立无产阶级的权威，加强组织纪律性。
    加强组织纪律性，必须严格请示报告。这对于领导干部来说，尤其重要。史无前例的文化大革命，我们在思想上缺乏准备，往往是很不理解，不自觉地用旧的一套思想和方法对待新的斗争任务，有时搞错了自己还不知道。只有及时地向毛主席的无产阶级司令部请示报告，得到指示和帮助，才有可能不犯或少犯错误。千万不可自以为是，自作聪明，自作主张，自以为是小事情，就想当然，随便处理。不请示不报告，必然要犯大错误，给革命事业造成严重损害。因此，严格请示报告，是加强组织纪律性的一个极为重要的方面。
    建立在高度自觉基础上的组织纪律性，是充分发挥革命性、实现科学性的重要保证。具有坚强的组织纪律性的无产阶级革命大军，才能正确地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，无往而不胜。
    （五）
    无产阶级的革命性与小资产阶级的保守性、摇摆性，科学性与主观、片面、表面性，组织纪律性与自由散漫、无政府主义，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的反映。加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，归根结底是一个世界观的改造问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。两种世界观的本质区别就是为“公”还是为“私”的问题。公字当头，一心为公，无私无畏，才能敢革敢闯，敢于实事求是，敢于坚持真理，作执行政策纪律的模范，才能具有坚强的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。反之，私字当头，“三性”皆无。一心为私，必然畏首畏尾，怕这怕那，右倾保守，不敢革命，不敢彻底革命，或者摇摆不定，乱冲蛮干；必然不敢实事求是，不敢正视客观真理，言行不一；必然要发展小团体主义，山头主义，风头主义，极端民主化，破坏革命的组织纪律。无产阶级革命派，必须在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，破私立公，改造世界观。
    破私立公最最根本的关键，是在头脑中大破特破资产阶级思想，大立特立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要遵照林副主席的指示：“要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”老老实实地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。不断破除自己头脑中的非无产阶级思想，排除来自“左”的和右的干扰，自觉地加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。高举革命的批判大旗，促进、实现、巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向，永远乘风破浪，奋勇前进！　（新华社）
