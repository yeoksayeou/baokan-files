The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique is becoming blacker by the day. The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, "Pravda," published an anti-China article on August 30, openly and shamelessly defending the American imperialists' aggression in Southeast Asia, covering up the traitorous acts of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique as the American imperialists' accomplices, and wildly slandering the Chinese people who resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia.

For many years, American imperialism has been aggressively invading and plundering Southeast Asia, which is determined by the nature of imperialism. However, the anti-China article in "Pravda" brazenly whitewashes American imperialism, absurdly claiming that the American imperialists' aggressive activities in Southeast Asia over the years are not due to their imperialist nature but are "caused" by the Chinese people who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely oppose American aggression, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the various countries in Southeast Asia.

Everyone knows that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists have been colluding for many years, using every means to support and curry favor with the reactionaries of India, Japan, and other countries, and to form an anti-China encirclement. Recently, they have joined forces with the American imperialists to establish the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" as part of the anti-China encirclement in Asia. However, the anti-China article in "Pravda" turns black into white and absurdly fabricates that "the United States particularly values India and Japan" because China has implemented a "great power chauvinist policy." It absurdly claims that the American and British imperialist lackeys of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, "Malaysia," and "Singapore" organized the so-called "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" under the American imperialists' plot due to their "concerns" about China's policy. What is even more absurd is that this anti-China article also boasts about the already tattered banner of so-called "joint action," claiming that the American imperialists' large-scale armed invasion of Vietnam and their continuous escalation of the war are because China refused to take "joint action" with the Soviet revisionists. This is a complete case of "the thief crying 'stop thief'." It is well known that the reason the American imperialists dare to wage the war of aggression against Vietnam and continuously escalate the war of aggression is, apart from being determined by their nature of aggression, precisely the result of the Soviet revisionists' comprehensive collusion with the American imperialists and betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

To defend the American imperialists, the article in "Pravda" also plays the American imperialists' anti-China tune, wantonly attacking China for developing nuclear weapons for the sake of defense. The article quotes the language of the American Pentagon gangsters, saying that the reason the United States stationed B-52 strategic bombers on Guam is that "China detonated the first atomic bomb," and thus it is "forced" and is for "consolidating security" in the Pacific region. Moreover, the article says, "Every nuclear explosion by China has triggered a similar response (from the United States)." The Soviet revisionist clique here shamelessly plays the role of the trumpet blower for the American imperialist gangsters' logic.

In recent times, especially after the Middle East incident, the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership has been more exposed than ever, and they are in a state of internal and external turmoil, in a very embarrassing situation. To get out of this predicament and to cover up their treacherous acts of pushing the Glasboro talks conspiracy and colluding with the American imperialists globally, betraying the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world, Southeast Asia, and first and foremost the Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionist clique has spared no effort, frantically anti-China, and wildly slandering and defaming China. The article in "Pravda" is precisely a piece of anti-China "masterpiece" thrown out by the Soviet revisionist clique in this context.

    苏修叛徒嘴脸愈描愈黑
    《消息报》发表反华文章大肆为美帝涂脂抹粉暴露一副奴才相
    据新华社九日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义集团的喉舌《消息报》八月三十日发表一篇反华文章，公然赤裸裸地为美帝国主义在东南亚的侵略罪行辩护，掩饰勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团充当美帝帮凶的叛徒行径，疯狂诬蔑坚决支持东南亚人民革命斗争的中国人民。
    多年来，美帝国主义在东南亚到处进行侵略和掠夺，这是帝国主义本性所决定的。然而，《消息报》这篇反华文章，却放肆地为美帝涂脂抹粉，胡说美帝多年来在东南亚的这些侵略活动，不是出于帝国主义的本性，而是由于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对美帝侵略，坚决支持东南亚各国人民革命斗争的中国人民“造成的”。
    谁都知道，苏修和美帝多年来狼狈为奸，千方百计地扶植和拉拢印度、日本等国反动派，拼凑反华包围圈。最近，它又伙同美帝，建立了作为亚洲反华包围圈一部分的“东南亚国家联盟”。而《消息报》这篇反华文章，颠倒黑白，荒谬透顶地胡诌什么“美国特别重视印度和日本”，是由于中国执行了什么“大国主义方针”。胡说什么印度尼西亚、菲律宾、泰国、“马来西亚”、“新加坡”这些美英帝国主义走狗在美帝策划下组织所谓“东南亚国家联盟”，是出于“对中国政策的担心”。尤其荒唐的是，这篇反华文章还大放厥词，打起早已破烂不堪的所谓“联合行动”的招牌，把美帝对越南发动大规模武装侵略，不断进行战争升级，说成是因为中国拒绝同苏修采取“联合行动”，是中国“请求华盛顿把东南亚冲突无节制地升级”。这完全是玩弄“贼喊捉贼”的把戏。人所共知，美帝之所以敢于进行侵越战争，并不断把侵略战争升级，除了为它的侵略本性所决定外，正是苏修全面同美帝勾结，出卖越南人民的结果。
    为了替美帝辩护，《消息报》这篇文章还弹起美帝的反华滥调，对中国为了防御需要而发展核武器恣意地进行攻击。文章援引美国五角大楼的强盗语言说，美国之所以把B—52战略轰炸机进驻关岛，是因为“中国爆炸了第一颗原子弹”，因而是“被迫的”，是为了“在太平洋地区‘巩固安全’”。而且，文章说，“中国每一次核爆炸都引起了（美国）类似的反应”。苏修集团在这里空前露骨地扮演了美帝强盗逻辑的吹鼓手的角色。
    最近一个时期以来，特别是在中东事件以后，苏修领导集团的叛徒面目空前大暴露，内外交困，处境十分狼狈。为了摆脱这种窘境，同时为掩盖他们推行葛拉斯堡罗会谈密谋的美苏全球大勾结，出卖世界人民、东南亚人民，首先是越南人民的革命事业的叛徒行径，苏修集团用尽力气，拚命反华，疯狂地中伤、诬蔑中国。《消息报》这篇文章，正是苏修集团在这种背景下抛出来的一篇反华“杰作”。
