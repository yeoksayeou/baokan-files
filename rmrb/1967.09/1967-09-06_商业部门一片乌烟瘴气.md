The commercial sector in the Soviet Union is in a state of utter chaos. After the Soviet revisionist leadership implemented the "profit first" and free competition "new system," the commercial sector has become a mess. Recently, a ordinary Soviet commercial worker, Krupenikova, wrote a letter to the *Literary Gazette*, angrily denouncing the current state of the commercial sector where corruption, embezzlement, and "nervous tension, fear, disorder, and intimidation" prevail.

Krupenikova wrote: "I planned to work as a warehouse manager at a cold drink supply station. I shared my plan with some people and sought their advice. They warned me: 'Working in the commercial sector requires skill... It's better not to go to the commercial sector.'"

"The supply station I went to is located in a dark and dirty basement of a large building, next to a canteen's warehouse."

"In the first few days, the depth of this warning became apparent. It seems that counting a few kilograms per box of ice cream is a simple task, after all, it's not like counting needles. But when you actually get down to it..."

Krupenikova went on to describe how boxes of ice cream frequently go missing, the quality of the goods is poor, and there are often "packages that are short in quantity or have already hardened." She said, "All these shortages are deducted from the warehouse manager's salary."

"From the very first days, I became familiar with the 'situation.' My colleague works alone from eight in the morning to eight at night, with no days off and no holidays. Generally, there should be four warehouse managers, with two people per shift, but except for the larger supply stations, almost all supply stations have eliminated the fourth warehouse manager position, and one person takes over the shift, with the third manager spending part of the day helping with orders and processing documents."

"Stealing ice cream is not very complicated: take a few boxes and sell them through the ice cream salesgirls, then split the proceeds. You don't even need to involve the ice cream salesgirls, because at the supply station, from the helpers to the director, many people are selling ice cream."

Krupenikova pointed out that here, extortion, theft, "greed for rubles," "stuffing rubles," "keeping rubles in contact," and only caring about making money have become the norm. "I frankly admit, I was too timid and had to leave."

Krupenikova said: "I decided to try my luck as a cashier at a supply station. During my short time as a cashier, I participated in the settlement of transportation fees, postal fees, and so on, not just once. Are there really so many letters coming and going? Are there really so many business trips? Anyway, no one will come to check, because everything is done according to the regulations. Someone hinted to me: 'In the commercial sector, if you have the ability, you can do anything, but if you don't have the ability, you'll end up without pants and give way to others.' Anything can be accounted for, as long as you can collude. Alas, I didn't learn that trick."

"What is it that makes people fear the commercial sector? Is it the dull atmosphere that outsiders feel, or the fear of the chaotic situation?"

The chaotic situation in the Soviet commercial sector today is the result of the Soviet revisionist leadership's restoration of capitalism. The Soviet revisionists' backward policies in commerce have aroused strong indignation among the broad masses. The ordinary commercial worker Krupenikova's denunciation of the Soviet revisionists through her personal experience is just one example. The increasingly awakened Soviet people will not allow such a situation to continue for long. They will definitely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership.

### 商业部门一片乌烟瘴气

　　商业部门一片乌烟瘴气
    苏修领导集团推行“利润第一”、自由竞争的“新体制”之后，苏联商业部门里闹得乌烟瘴气。不久前，苏联一位普通的商业工作者克鲁佩尼科娃写信给《文学报》，愤怒控诉目前商业部门营私舞弊、贪污盗窃、“神经紧张、恐惧、紊乱、进行恐吓”。
    克鲁佩尼科娃写道：“我打算到冷饮供应站当仓库管理员，我把自己的打算告诉一些人，征求他们的意见，他们警告我：在商业部门工作是要有本领的。……最好不要到商业部门去。”
    “我去的那个供应站设在一座大楼的阴暗而肮脏的地下室里，在一所食堂的仓库旁边。”
    “头几天就显示出了这一忠告的深刻意义。看来，没有比数几公斤一箱的冰激凌更简单的事了，要知道这不是数针。但是，真正接触到实际就……”
    克鲁佩尼科娃接着叙述了成箱的冰激凌经常丢失、货物质量差、经常出现“一包包不够数的、或者已经变硬的冰激凌”等等现象。她说，“这些缺数要全部从仓库管理员的工资中扣除”。
    “我从头几天起就熟悉‘情况’了。我的配手每天一个人从八点工作到八点，没有休息天，没有节日。一般说来，应该有四个仓库管理员，规定两个人一班，但是除了大的供应站外，几乎所有的供应站上第四个仓库管理员的职位都被裁减了，而是一个人顶一班，第三个管理员每天上班有一部分时间帮助订购，处理文件。”
      “偷冰激凌是不很复杂的事：拿几箱通过卖冰激凌的售货员卖掉，平分进款。甚至不一定找卖冰激凌的售货员，因为供应站上从帮工到主任，许多人都在卖冰激凌。”
    克鲁佩尼科娃指出，在这里，敲诈、偷盗、“对卢布不厌其多”、“塞卢布”、“保持卢布接触”、只顾赚钱等等，已“蔚然成风”。“我坦白承认，我太胆怯了，只得走开。”
    克鲁佩尼科娃说：“我决定在一个供应站当出纳员碰碰运气。在我当出纳员这个不长的时间里，不止一次地参加运费、邮费……等开支的结算。实际上信件的来往真是这么频繁吗？真有这么多因公外出吗？反正谁也不会来检查，因为一切都是按规定的条文办的。有人向我暗示：‘在商业部门只要有本领什么都能办到，要没有本领就会落得穿不上裤子，让位给别人。’什么都可以销账，只要会一起作弊。唉，我就是没有学会这一套。”
    “究竟是什么东西使人们对商业部门望而生畏呢？是那种使外行所感到的沉闷气氛，是对混乱局面的恐惧。”
    今天苏联商业部门的混乱局面，正是苏修领导集团复辟资本主义的结果。苏修在商业中的倒行逆施已引起广大群众的强烈愤慨，普通的商业工作者克鲁佩尼科娃通过亲身体验而对苏修提出的控诉，就是一个例证。日益觉醒的苏联人民是不能听任这种局面长期存在下去的，他们一定会起来造苏修领导集团的反。
