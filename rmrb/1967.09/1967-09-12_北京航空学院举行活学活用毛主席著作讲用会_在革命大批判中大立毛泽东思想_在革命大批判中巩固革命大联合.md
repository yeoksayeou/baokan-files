Beijing Institute of Aeronautics holds a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the midst of the revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought is firmly established. In the midst of the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity is strengthened.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, at a crucial moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of the Red Flag Combat Team and the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics held a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works on September 8. They resolved to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

The representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and the General Service Group of the Red Flag Combat Team spoke at the meeting: Over the past year, all the victories we have achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the victories of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be nothing for the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, and there would be no new Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. We must follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao and place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better, and achieve new levels in the high tide of revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary teachers and students from the 4411 class of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, the Red Three System, the "Rushing Forward" and "Fight to the End" combat groups of the Eighth Specialty, and the joint combat group of the Red Flag 916 Brigade of the Seventh System exchanged their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the revolutionary criticism. Their common experience is that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, overcome various difficulties, and steadfastly carry out the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units. Recently, a "link-up" wind blew through society, and some students were not focused on sitting down to carry out the revolutionary criticism. The 4411 class and other classes of revolutionary teachers and students organized timely study of Chairman Mao's works in response to this ideological trend, used Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to correctly analyze the current situation, and conducted internal rectification. Through study, they realized that revolutionary criticism is the most important political issue and principle at present, and they resolved to stop the "link-up" wind. In the revolutionary criticism movement, they also seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," correctly handled the contradictions between leaders and the masses, between Red Flag soldiers and non-Red Flag soldiers, between revolutionary rebels and the masses who had been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, and between teachers and students, further promoting and strengthening revolutionary unity. The entire institute saw the emergence of many advanced combat collectives armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics who studied and applied Chairman Mao's works during the criticism deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary criticism and the sharpest weapon. The "Rushing Forward" and "Fight to the End" combat groups composed of students from the 268 class of the Eighth Specialty and teachers from the 608 teaching and research group once chose a topic "Khrushchev of China is the defender of the exploiting class" for joint criticism. How to start the criticism, everyone was initially unsure. They first seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, clarified the direction, decided to collect materials extensively, and then analyze and research, grasping the key points for criticism. When writing the criticism article, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, continuously discussed and revised, deepening and improving step by step, and finally wrote a relatively weighty criticism article. They believed that only by sitting down, delving in, treating the battlefield of revolutionary criticism as a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning in the criticism, and using in the criticism, can we criticize the enemy deeply and thoroughly, and achieve new levels of learning and application.

The representatives of the Red Flag 916 Brigade Joint Combat Group and the Red Three System revolutionary teachers and students introduced their experiences of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units. After the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics took power, some comrades gradually developed a sense of peaceful complacency in their minds and failed to see the class struggle within the institute. Faced with this situation, the soldiers of the 916 Brigade and the revolutionary teachers and students of the Third System seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. They realized that if the political, ideological, and theoretical issues with the handful of power-holders within the party and the handful of power-holders within the institute who are taking the capitalist road are not thoroughly criticized, the danger of capitalist restoration still exists. Therefore, this struggle must be carried to the end. After clarifying the direction, they fully mobilized the masses, conducted investigations and research, and resolutely repelled the counterattack of conservative forces, insisting on combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units. In the process of exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the institute who are taking the capitalist road, the argument of simply pursuing "black line relationships" emerged, claiming that "only those with black organizational ties to the old municipal committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique are the four types of cadres," and so on, attempting to lead the masses' exposure and criticism of the power-holders taking the capitalist road astray. In response to this issue, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and firmly grasped the key issues of the handful of power-holders within the institute who are taking the capitalist road towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, conducting a systematic exposure and criticism from a political standpoint. It is through continuous study and application of Chairman Mao's works that they have achieved initial results in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the institute.

The Red Flag soldiers and revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics realized that to carry out the revolutionary criticism well, not only must the role of revolutionary students be fully played, but also the role of revolutionary teachers must be fully played. In the past, due to the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, some teachers had concerns about saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing and being criticized by students, and some still had the idea of "fighting, criticizing, and leaving." The Red Flag soldiers actively did the work of the teachers, and at the same time welcomed revolutionary teachers to come out of the teaching and research rooms and go to the students, combining with the students. Many teachers voluntarily organized to study Chairman Mao's works, overcame selfish thoughts, and resolved to go to the students. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, most of the teachers in the entire institute went down to the small classes to fight together with revolutionary students.

The revolutionary workers' representative of the affiliated 881 Factory of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics introduced their achievements and experiences in seizing the revolution and promoting production under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the direct-affiliated units of the three military branches and the soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who were guiding military and political training in Beijing Institute of Aeronautics were invited to attend this meeting. Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Comrade Chang Qunkun, spoke on behalf of the Air Force Party Committee and the proletarian revolutionary factions of the direct-affiliated units of the Air Force, congratulating the revolutionary youngsters of the Red Flag of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics on their achievements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and encouraging the revolutionary teachers and students to achieve new merits.

    北京航空学院举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会
    在革命大批判中大立毛泽东思想  在革命大批判中巩固革命大联合
    据新华社九日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命进入重要关头的时刻，北京航空学院红旗战斗队的战士和广大革命师生九月八日举行了活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署、掀起革命大批判的新高潮。
    北航革命委员会、红旗战斗队总勤务组代表在会上发言说：一年来，我们在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一个又一个的胜利，都是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。没有毛泽东思想，就没有北航革命师生的一切，就没有新北航。我们一定要遵循林彪副统帅的指示，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在革命的大批判高潮中学出新水平，用出新水平。
    北航四四一一班、红三系、第八专业“奔腾急”“干到底”战斗组、红旗九一六兵团七系联合战斗组等单位的革命师生，在会上交流了在革命的大批判中活学活用毛主席著作的心得和体会。他们的共同体会是：只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，战胜各种困难，坚定不移地搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。前些日子，社会上刮起了一股“串连风”，有些学生不安心坐下来搞革命的大批判。四四一一班和其他班级的革命师生，针对这种活思想，及时组织学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想作指针正确地分析了当前形势，并进行了内部整风。通过学习，他们认识到革命的大批判是当前最大的政治，最重要的原则，下定决心煞住了“串连风”。在革命的大批判运动中，他们还认真学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，正确处理了领导和群众之间、红旗战士和非红旗战士之间、革命造反派和受过资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众之间、教师和学生之间存在的矛盾，进一步促进和巩固了革命的大联合。全院出现了许多用毛泽东思想武装起来的先进战斗集体。
    在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作的北航革命师生深深地体会到：毛泽东思想是革命大批判的灵魂，是革命大批判的最锐利的武器。第八专业二六八班同学和六○八教研室教师组成的“奔腾急”“干到底”两个战斗组，曾经选择了一个题目《中国的赫鲁晓夫是剥削阶级的辩护士》，共同进行批判。如何入手批判，开始大家心里没有底。他们带着这个问题首先认真学习了毛主席著作，明确了方向，决定先广泛地收集资料，然后进行分析研究，抓住要害进行批判。在写批判文章时，他们又反复学习毛主席著作，不断地进行讨论和修改，步步深入，步步提高，终于写出了比较有分量的批判文章。他们认为，只有坐下来，钻进去，把革命大批判的战场当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，在大批判中学，在大批判中用，才能把敌人批深批透，才能学出新的水平，用出新的水平。
    红旗九一六兵团七系联合战斗组和红三系革命师生代表在会上介绍了用毛泽东思想指导本单位的斗批改的体会。在北航红旗战斗队掌权以后，有些同志渐渐地在思想里产生了和平麻痹思想，看不清院内的阶级斗争。面对这种情况，九一六兵团战士和三系革命师生认真学习了毛主席著作。他们认识到如果不在政治上思想上理论上把党内最大的一小撮和院内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，资本主义复辟的危险仍然存在，因此，必须将这场斗争进行到底。大方向明确以后，他们充分发动群众，进行调查研究，坚决击退了保守势力的反扑，坚持把革命的大批判和本单位斗批改结合起来。在揭发、批判院内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派过程中，曾出现了单纯追“黑线关系”的论调，说什么“与旧市委反革命修正主义集团有黑组织联系的才是四类干部”等等，企图把群众对走资本主义道路当权派的揭发批判引入歧途。针对这个问题，他们认真学习了毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争的教导，用毛泽东思想作武器，紧紧抓住院内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对无产阶级专政的态度等要害问题，从政治上进行了系统的揭发批判。他们就是这样，经过不断地活学活用毛主席著作，在本院的斗批改中取得了初步成绩。
    北航红旗战士和革命师生认识到：要搞好革命的大批判，不但要充分发挥革命学生的作用，而且要充分发挥革命教师的作用。过去由于资产阶级反动路线的压制，有些教师存在着怕说错话办错事被同学抓辫子等思想顾虑，有的还存在“斗、批、走”的思想。红旗战士针对教师的活思想积极作教师的工作，同时欢迎革命的教师走出教研室，到学生中去，跟学生结合。许多教师自动组织起来学习毛主席著作，克服私心杂念，下定决心到同学中去。在毛泽东思想指引下，全院大部分教师下到小班同革命同学共同战斗。
    北航附属八八一厂的革命工人代表介绍了他们在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下抓革命促生产取得的成就和经验。
    中国人民解放军三军直属机关无产阶级革命派的代表和在北航指导军政训练的人民解放军某部指战员等应邀出席了这次讲用会。中国人民解放军空军副司令员常乾坤代表空军党委和空军直属机关无产阶级革命派讲了话，祝贺北航红旗的革命小将活学活用毛主席著作的成就，勉励革命师生立新功。
