Japanese Gear Theater Troupe Visits Dazhai

New China News Agency, Taiyuan, September 28 — The revolutionary artists of the Japanese Gear Theater Troupe visited Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province from September 25 to 27. They were warmly received and enthusiastically welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The members of the Gear Theater Troupe visited the terraced fields built by the commune members in the rugged terrain, and saw the various crops ready for harvest. They spontaneously waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" and sang "The East Is Red" loudly. They said, "This visit has made us understand more clearly that with Mao Tse-tung's thought, anything can be done, and miracles can be created."

Chen Yung-kuei, secretary of the Party branch of Dazhai Brigade, gave a detailed account of the development of Dazhai Brigade and the application of Mao Tse-tung's works and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by the Dazhai people to the Japanese friends. Fujikawa Natsu, director of the Gear Theater Troupe, said, "All the achievements you have made are great victories of Mao Tse-tung's thought. These achievements have made me deeply realize that once Mao Tse-tung's thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force. To make revolution, one must study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will definitely do so in the future."

The members of the Gear Theater Troupe labored with the commune members in Dazhai and visited the poor and lower-middle peasants. Before leaving Dazhai, the revolutionary artists of the Gear Theater Troupe held a joint evening party with the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai. The Japanese friends performed songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao Tse-tung, such as "On the Golden Mountain in Peking" and "Long Live Chairman Mao Tse-tung Forever," which they had learned and rehearsed in China. The commune members of Dazhai also sang songs of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung and performed songs and dances praising the great leader Chairman Mao Tse-tung.

Chen Yung-kuei, secretary of the Party branch of Dazhai Brigade, on behalf of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade, presented a banner to the Gear Theater Troupe. The members of the Gear Theater Troupe, on behalf of the leftist Miyako Branch of the Japanese Communist Party and the Miyako Proletarian Alliance, presented a banner to the heroic Dazhai people.

　　日本齿轮座文艺战士访问大寨
    新华社太原二十八日电　日本齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士们，从九月二十五日到二十七日参观访问了山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，受到贫下中农社员的盛情接待和热烈欢迎。
    齿轮座剧团的同志们在大寨参观了社员们在沟壑遍地的条件下，自力更生建起的水平梯田，看到这些梯田里各种作物一片丰收在望的景象，情不自禁地挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，放声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。他们说，这次参观使我们更加明白了只要有了毛泽东思想，什么事情都能办到，什么奇迹都会出现。
    大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志向日本朋友详细介绍了大寨大队的发展过程，介绍了大寨人活学活用毛主席著作和无产阶级文化大革命的情况。齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子说，你们所取得的一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这些成就使我深深体会到，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会产生出巨大的物质力量。要干革命，就得学习毛主席著作，听毛主席话，照毛主席指示办事。今后我们一定这样做。
    齿轮座剧团的同志在大寨同社员一起参加了劳动，并访问了贫下中农社员。离开大寨前，齿轮座剧团革命文艺战士们和大寨贫下中农社员一起举行了联欢晚会。日本朋友演出了在中国学习排练的歌颂世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲《在北京的金山上》、《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》等精彩节目。大寨大队的社员也演唱了毛主席语录歌和歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌舞节目。
    大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵代表大寨大队的贫下中农社员，向齿轮座剧团赠送了锦旗。齿轮座剧团的同志代表日共山口县（左派）弥富支部、弥富无产者同盟向英雄的大寨人赠送了锦旗。
