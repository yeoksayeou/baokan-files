With hearts full of red loyalty, we pledge to Chairman Mao. We vow to achieve new merits for the people. All personnel of the Air Force stationed in Zhejiang are united in their resolve. We will follow the great leader Chairman Mao and the great proletarian revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China. We will resolutely carry out the decisions of the Central Committee and the Military Commission. We will smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. We will defend the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. We will strive to build the People's Liberation Army into an invincible revolutionary force. We will contribute all our strength to the cause of the great proletarian cultural revolution. We will achieve new victories for the people. Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution! Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!
