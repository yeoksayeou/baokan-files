	Our heroic air force shoots down a U.S.-made KMT U-12 aircraft

	The Central Military Commission issues a commendation order stating: This battle was fought extremely well, and is the result of the participating troops' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. It is hoped that the participating troops will heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strictly guard their battle positions, and let all invading enemies come to no avail, be shattered to pieces.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: This morning, a U.S.-made KMT U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft intruded into the airspace over a certain place in East China and was immediately shot down by our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force. This is the fifth U.S.-made KMT U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down by our heroic People's Liberation Army since September 1962.

	This victory was achieved in the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide billion military and civilian people following the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, launching a mass criticism of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and achieving great victories. This is another new victory achieved by our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with practical actions, in response to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote preparedness" and "support the army and love the people."

	Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: The Central Military Commission today issued a commendation order, praising the People's Liberation Army Air Force unit that shot down a U.S.-made KMT U-2 type high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over a certain place in East China this morning.

	The commendation order states: In this battle, you have implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of swift victory in campaigns and battles. This battle was fought bravely and decisively, cleverly and flexibly, and was fought extremely well. Your victory is the best tribute to the Party and Chairman Mao at the time when the nationwide military and civilian people are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great leader Chairman Mao. It is the best action in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote preparedness" and "support the army and love the people." It is a new achievement you have made in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Your victory is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses nationwide and a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the KMT bandits.

	The commendation order points out: The participating troops, under the correct leadership and command of their superiors, have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "all our military personnel must improve their military arts and advance courageously in an inevitably victorious war, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate all enemies." They have excellently completed their combat mission. This is the result of your high raising of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and greatly emphasizing proletarian politics. It is a great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	The commendation order states: Recently, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the KMT bandits have been actively stepping up their war preparations, stirring up trouble, and attempting to carry out sabotage and disruption against us. Therefore, it is hoped that the participating troops will remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "one must never relax one's fighting will even slightly," heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strictly guard their battle positions, and let all daring invading air enemies come to no avail and be shattered to pieces.
