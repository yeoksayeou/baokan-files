At a time when the revolutionary masses across the nation are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "On Two Books by Tao Zhu" has been published. This brilliant article, shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, is like a heavy artillery shell that hits the political vital spot of the counter-revolutionary two-faced character; it is like a dagger that pierces through Tao Zhu's disguise, completely exposing the counter-revolutionary face of this ambitious man who claims to be a "basically proletarian revolutionary."

Tao Zhu, this counter-revolutionary two-faced character, is a thoroughgoing Khrushchev-style conspirator. He shifts from right to "ultra-left," using various treacherous and despicable methods to fiercely oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, attempting to carry out a capitalist restoration. The "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything" evil wind he stirred up during the Cultural Revolution has spread widely and caused great harm, having created a rather bad influence in Qingdao City. Currently, Qingdao City is gradually eliminating these poisons through revolutionary criticism.

The birth and growth of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee have made a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party hate it to the core. They are always trying to sabotage this new power, aiming to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. However, they know that the situation has changed, and it is no longer feasible to act nakedly. Thus, they change their tactics, waving the banner of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything." Some people, due to the existence of mountainism, cliquism, and windism in their minds, often adapt to the needs of the class enemy, doing things that make friends and relatives suffer and enemies rejoice.

In June of this year, Qingdao City saw a surge of such countercurrents. A small handful of people with ulterior motives attempted to overthrow revolutionary leading cadres who had already come out to participate in the "three-in-one" power structure of the city, and then strike one by one, disintegrate the red power—Qingdao Revolutionary Committee—already affirmed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the same time, the class enemies maliciously directed their spears at the great People's Liberation Army, viciously stirring up military-civilian relations, attempting to disintegrate the Revolutionary Committee.

The facts of class struggle have told us that after the proletarian revolutionary masses take power, class struggle is still very intense, and the center of struggle is still the power issue. The class enemies always direct their attacks at the proletarian dictatorship, attempting to overthrow the proletarian power. It is only because of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses that the enemies are forced to change their tactics, adopting more concealed and more treacherous means to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, from the "left" or the right, to disrupt the revolutionary criticism. Not long ago, these guys shouted things like "Qingdao is ruled by conservatives," "Qingdao has no armed struggle, it doesn't look like a cultural revolution," "Qingdao must be in chaos," and they spread these "left" in form but right in essence slogans, aiming to disrupt our ranks, so that they can fish in troubled waters, benefit from it, and achieve their evil goal of weakening and destroying the proletarian dictatorship.

Of course, the class enemies' conspiracies will never succeed. "The more cunning the scheme, the more likely it is to backfire!" All those who, like Tao Zhu, think they are "clever" and play tricks will ultimately meet a bad end.

We, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary Red Guards of Qingdao City, have become stronger after more than a year of class struggle storms. Now, we are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a surging high tide of revolutionary criticism on the shores of Jiaozhou Bay, criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong and Qingdao, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. If the enemies dare to shake the new revolutionary power, they will be like an insect blocking a chariot, seeking their own destruction.

　　新生的革命政权不可动摇
　　青岛大中学校红代会
    正当全国亿万无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起革命大批判高潮的时候，姚文元同志的《评陶铸的两本书》发表了。这篇闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的好文章，象一颗重型炮弹，击中了反革命两面派的政治要害；它象一把匕首，戳穿了陶铸的画皮，把这个自称为“基本上是无产阶级革命家”的野心家的反革命面目，完全暴露在光天化日之下了。
    陶铸这个反革命两面派，是一个十足的赫鲁晓夫式的阴谋家。他忽而右，忽而极“左”，用各种阴险卑鄙的手法，疯狂地反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，妄图实行资本主义复辟。他在文化大革命中刮起的“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的妖风，流毒甚广，危害甚大，在青岛市就曾经造成了相当恶劣的影响。目前，青岛市正在通过革命的大批判，逐步肃清这方面的流毒。
    青岛市革命委员会的诞生和成长壮大，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派恨之入骨。他们无时无刻不在妄图搞垮这个新政权，实行反革命复辟。但是他们知道，形势变了，象过去那样赤膊上阵是行不通了。于是他们就改变策略，打起了“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的破旗。而有些人，由于头脑里存在着山头主义、小团体主义、风头主义等等资产阶级个人主义思想，就往往适应了阶级敌人的需要，做出了一些使亲者痛仇者快的事情。
    今年六月，青岛市就出现了一股这样的逆流。一小撮别有用心的人妄图把早已站出来参加了市“三结合”权力机构的革命领导干部打倒，进而各个击破，瓦解党中央、毛主席早已肯定的红色政权——青岛市革命委员会。与此同时，阶级敌人还别有用心地把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军，恶毒挑拨军民关系，企图瓦解革命委员会。
    阶级斗争的事实告诉了我们，无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，阶级斗争依然是十分激烈的，而斗争的中心，仍然是政权问题。阶级敌人总是把攻击的矛头指向无产阶级专政，企图颠覆无产阶级的政权。只是由于无产阶级革命派的伟大胜利，迫使敌人不得不改变策略，采取更加隐蔽，更加阴险的手段来进行反革命活动，从“左”的方面，或右的方面，来扰乱革命的大批判。不久前，这些家伙大嚷什么“青岛是保守派掌权”，“青岛没有武斗，不象文化大革命的样子”，“青岛必须大乱”等等，他们大肆散布这种形“左”实右的论调，目的就是打乱我们的阵脚，好让他们混水摸鱼，从中得利，以达到削弱和破坏无产阶级专政的罪恶目的。
    当然，阶级敌人的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。“机关算尽太聪明，反误了卿卿性命！”一切象陶铸那样自以为“聪明”，玩弄阴谋的人，最终是不会有好结果的。
    我们青岛市无产阶级革命派，革命的红卫兵小将，经过一年多来阶级斗争暴风雨的洗礼，已经越战越强。现在，我们正在按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，在胶州湾畔掀起风起云涌的革命大批判高潮，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东和青岛的代理人，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。如果敌人不自量力，胆敢动摇新生的革命政权，他们就是螳臂当车，自取灭亡。
