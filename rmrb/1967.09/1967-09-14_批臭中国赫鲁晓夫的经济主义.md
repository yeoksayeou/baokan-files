In the arsenal of China's Khrushchev, there are many weapons of reaction against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, stolen from both old and new revisionists. One of these is economicism.

Economicism has always been a reactionary tool used by the bourgeoisie to sabotage the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. Its characteristic is to replace political struggle with economic struggle, to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, to lead the masses' struggle onto the wrong path of economicism, making them pursue only personal and immediate interests, forgetting the class and long-term interests. In the workers' movement, to promote economicism is a trick used by the bourgeoisie's agents, the labor traitors—various opportunists—to sabotage the workers' revolutionary movement and betray the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.

The self-proclaimed "model of the workers' movement" and "leader of the Chinese workers' movement," China's Khrushchev, is precisely such a great labor traitor who zealously peddles the goods of economicism in the workers' movement.

It was he who, during the Anshan workers' movement from 1922 to 1925, catered to the needs of the capitalists and feudal officials, leading the workers' revolutionary struggle onto the path of "improving living conditions" and "seeking a way to live," making concessions and surrendering to the capitalists, and temporarily destroying the revolutionary fruits achieved by the great leader Chairman Mao in the Anshan workers' struggle.

It was he who, during the May 30th anti-imperialist movement, was frightened by the revolutionary fire of the workers and quickly colluded with the imperialists and comprador capitalists, attempting to lead the workers' struggle against imperialism onto the wrong path of economicism.

It was he who, during the high tide of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Great Revolution, slandered the workers' movement, accusing the workers of being "leftist" and cursing the workers for "becoming more and more radical, causing serious impacts on society, politics, economy, and public opinion." He also used the authority he stole as the deputy chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to deliver a speech at the Third National Labor Congress in 1926, openly proposing: "The future direction of the workers' movement should be various economic struggles. The development of economic struggles is the development of the Chinese workers' movement." This made the line of economicism in the workers' movement gain "legal" status in the Chinese workers' movement.

It was he who, in various historical periods of the Chinese revolution, wrote articles, gave reports, and issued instructions, vigorously advocating that "the daily economic demands of the workers should be used as a slogan to mobilize the workers"; that one should "faithfully struggle to achieve the economic demands of the masses"; that "trade unions are economic organizations, mainly solving the workers' immediate living problems, struggling for the workers' immediate living conditions"; that strikes could only raise "the most urgent demands of the workers" and so on. He also used the pretext of opposing "leftism," "sectarianism," and "adventurism" to attack the workers' movement for "struggling solely for political tasks" and opposing "adding political slogans and demands to the economic demands of the masses." Even during the period of the anti-Japanese and anti-Kuomintang struggle, workers were restricted in their strikes to raise "only the economic demands of the time and place, not high and 'leftist' political demands." His so-called high and "leftist" political demands referred to "opposing Japanese imperialism." This is how he attacked the political struggle of the working class against Japan and Kuomintang, boosting the morale of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and crushing the spirit of the working class.

It was still he who, after national liberation, continued to openly oppose the political struggle of the working class, advocating that "production movement is the workers' movement," promoting material incentives and money as the commander, vigorously promoting the all-people's trade unions and welfare trade unions, and teaching workers to "welcome" the exploitation of capitalists. He also promoted this set of revisionist goods abroad, opposing the armed struggle of the working class in various countries.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, it was he who, through his agents, used economicism as a counter-revolutionary weapon to launch a frenzied counterattack against the proletarian headquarters, attempting to save his doomed fate.

One black line, how clear! One black hand, how evil!

What "model of the workers' movement," what "leader of the Chinese workers' movement"! All are deceptions! He is a "model" who surrenders to the bourgeoisie, a "leader" of opportunism in the workers' movement, a great labor traitor who will be reviled for eternity!

To peddle this set of counter-revolutionary opportunist goods, he racked his brains and concocted various so-called reasons as bases.

First, he said: "Economic demands are the purpose of the masses," "economic problems are what workers must struggle for."

This is sheer sophistry!

Indeed, the working class in the old society suffered extremely heavy exploitation and lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Therefore, the working class faces serious economic problems and they struggle to solve "economic problems." However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, after a long period of class struggle, the working class has increasingly seen clearly: to fundamentally solve the problem of being free from exploitation, one cannot rely solely on economic struggle to achieve this, but must actively launch political struggle, seize power, and fundamentally overthrow the capitalist exploitation system. This is the key to solving the "economic problem." Lenin said: "The basic economic interests of the proletariat can only be satisfied through a political revolution that replaces the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the proletariat." China's Khrushchev, using "economic problems" as an excuse, opposes the political struggle of the working class and opposes the working class seizing power, thus fundamentally betraying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He does not place economic struggle in the appropriate position of serving and subordinating to political struggle, but according to the opportunist and capitulationist formula of "economic struggle is everything," he attempts to deceive and confuse the working masses, making them lose their way, forget the fundamentals, and thus limiting the workers' movement to the narrow scope allowed by the bourgeoisie. This fully exposes the ugly face of China's Khrushchev, the great labor traitor.

With the intensification of class struggle, the ruling class's treatment of the ruled class, the bourgeoisie's treatment of the proletariat, generally speaking, except for the fundamental issue of power, in other matters, they can "compromise" and "accommodate" when necessary. Everyone knows that using small favors to win hearts and minds, to preserve their reactionary rule, is a common tactic of the "civilized" rulers—bourgeois politicians—of the present age. Only those with shortsightedness and vulgarity will be satisfied with this, will be grateful to those who give them leftovers; while true revolutionaries will loudly denounce: "Who wants your stinking money, we want power!"

A political party of the working class, when leading the working masses in revolutionary struggle, is it building its policy on the basis of the long-term and fundamental interests of the working class, or on the basis of immediate and temporary interests? This is a matter of principle. Lenin said: "Temporary expedients, yielding to immediate events, yielding to minor political changes, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat, forgetting the basic characteristics of the entire capitalist system and the entire capitalist evolution, sacrificing the fundamental interests of the proletariat for actual or imagined temporary interests—this is the policy of revisionism." China's Khrushchev uses the ghost talk of "economic demands are the purpose of the masses" as the basis for his line of economicism in the workers' movement, thus precisely exposing his revisionist face.

Second, he said: "The Chinese proletariat is still very 'immature,' 'seizing power' is a very distant reality, and there is no need to discuss it much."

What nonsense!

The ability of the working class to seize power is determined not by whether the working masses are "immature," but by whether there is a vanguard of the working class armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—the Communist Party, and whether there is a proletarian revolutionary line grasped by the broad masses. With these conditions, the working class can quickly become mature and experienced in the test of revolutionary fire, and can defeat the enemy and seize power. On the contrary, if one is frightened by the paper tiger of the reactionaries, or is blinded by the crumbs given by the ruling class, not engaging in the struggle to seize power, contenting oneself with the status quo, waiting for the revolutionary conditions to "ripen," then one can only forever be in a position of being enslaved and butchered by others. Such lessons are not rare in the international workers' movement.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." To make a revolution and not educate the masses to recognize the necessity of "seizing power," not to mobilize and organize the masses to overthrow the reactionary government, what kind of revolution is that? To use the so-called "immaturity" of the working class to deny the necessity of the political struggle to seize power is a thoroughgoing capitulationist argument.

Third, he said: "Every economic struggle of the masses is at the same time a political struggle."

This is even more sophistry!

What is economic struggle? Lenin said: "Economic struggle is the collective struggle of workers to obtain favorable conditions for selling their labor power, to improve working and living conditions, and to struggle with the bosses. This struggle is necessarily a professional struggle." While political struggle, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, is a life-and-death struggle between classes, with the central content being the power issue. Marxists have always regarded class struggle as having three forms: economic struggle, political struggle, and ideological or theoretical struggle. The three are both related and distinct, and the most important form is political struggle. Politics is the soul, the commander. Compared to economics, politics cannot but occupy the primary position. This is the fundamental principle of Marxism. Marxists do not deny the significance of economic struggle, but they will not forget political struggle because of economic struggle. Instead, when organizing the masses' economic struggle, they use this struggle to educate the masses, raise the workers' socialist consciousness, make ideological and organizational preparations to overthrow the bourgeois reactionary government, make economic struggle serve the needs of political struggle, and quickly elevate economic struggle to the level of political struggle.

Lenin said so well: "To forget political struggle because of economic struggle is to abandon the basic principles of the entire international socialist movement, to forget everything that the entire history of the workers' movement has taught us." China's Khrushchev attempts to use this sophistry of "economic struggle is political struggle" to cancel out the political struggle of the working class and to cover up his betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause, which can only be a case of the more one covers up, the more it is exposed.

During the period of democratic revolution, the greatest political struggle facing the Chinese working class was the revolutionary war led by the Party, the establishment of revolutionary bases in the countryside, the mobilization, organization, and arming of hundreds of millions of people, using the countryside to encircle the cities and finally seizing the cities in a revolutionary war, to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to seize national power. In the period of socialist revolution, the greatest political struggle facing the Chinese working class is to firmly unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to carry the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end. China's Khrushchev does not mention proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. During the period of democratic revolution, he only called for workers to engage in "various economic struggles," and in the period of socialist revolution, he advocated that "production movement is the workers' movement," and so on. Is this not using economic struggle to replace the political struggle of the proletariat? Is this not leading the workers' revolutionary movement into the dead end of economicism?

The working class must engage in political struggle. The workers' movement must be a political movement of the working class. More than a hundred years ago, the founders of Marxism declared on behalf of the working class of the whole world: "Their goal can only be achieved by forcibly overthrowing all existing social institutions." Chairman Mao said: "The doctrines of Marxism are countless, but in the end, it is just one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this doctrine, they rebel, they struggle, they practice socialism." This is the political movement of the working class. Not engaging in the political struggle of the proletariat, not engaging in the dictatorship of the proletariat, being intoxicated with "economic struggle," and not touching the reactionary social system, such a workers' movement is one that the bourgeoisie can also accept. Limiting the class struggle of the working class to the scope of "economic struggle," leading the workers' movement onto the track of economicism, is equivalent to canceling the workers' movement, canceling the proletarian revolution, and is the greatest betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The traitors in the history of the international workers' movement did just that. Bernstein said: "The movement is everything, and the so-called ultimate goal of socialism is actually nothing." The slogan of the Russian Economists for the workers' movement was "struggle to improve economic conditions." China's Khrushchev is completely of the same tune, the same goods.

The zealous promoters of economicism, who seem to oppose political struggle on the surface, are actually engaging in political struggle. They are engaging in the political struggle of the bourgeoisie. China's Khrushchev repeatedly raises the "treasure" of economicism and imposes it on the workers' movement precisely because, like all opportunists, he is a spokesman for the bourgeoisie, he wants to promote capitalism, and he wants to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie. Before seizing power, he attempts to use this "treasure" to oppose the struggle of the working class to seize power, to maintain the reactionary rule of the big landlords and big capitalists; after the working class seizes power, he uses this "treasure" to weaken and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, to protect the bourgeoisie, to maintain the bourgeois headquarters led by him, and to achieve the goal of restoring capitalism in China. This is the essence of the matter.

History is ruthless. "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, which is an objective law that does not change with the will of people." Any attempt to reverse the course of history is doomed to fail. The so-called labor movement theory of Bernstein and his ilk has already become a laughing stock in history. The various tricks of China's Khrushchev to sabotage the proletarian revolutionary cause have been timely exposed and thoroughly smashed by our great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely sweep away all kinds of opportunist garbage, kick away the stumbling blocks on the road to progress, and with a powerful revolutionary storm, wash away the old world and build a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought!

    批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的经济主义	反修兵
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的武器库里，有许多从新老修正主义者那里搬来的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的破烂武器。其中之一，就是经济主义。
    经济主义，从来就是资产阶级破坏无产阶级革命事业的反动工具。它的特点，就是用经济斗争代替政治斗争，腐蚀群众的革命意志，把群众的斗争引向经济主义的歧途，使他们单纯地追求个人的、眼前的利益，忘记阶级的、长远的利益。在工人运动中大搞经济主义，这是资产阶级的代理人、工贼——形形色色的机会主义者破坏工人革命运动、出卖无产阶级革命事业的惯技。
    自吹为“工人运动模范”、“中国工人运动领袖”的中国赫鲁晓夫，就是这样一个在工人运动中狂热地推销经济主义货色的大工贼。
    就是他，在一九二二年至一九二五年的安源工人运动中，迎合资本家和封建官僚的需要，把工人的革命斗争引上“改善生活”、“谋生活之路”，对资本家实行妥协投降，一度破坏了我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自指挥的安源工人斗争所取得的革命果实。
    就是他，在“五卅”反帝运动中，被工人的革命烈火吓破了胆，赶忙同帝国主义分子和买办资本家勾搭，妄图把工人反对帝国主义的政治斗争，引向经济主义的歧途。
    就是他，对在反帝反封建的大革命高涨的年代里迅速发展的中国工人运动大放厥词，攻击工人“左倾”，咒骂工人“越干越厉害，在社会上、政治上、经济上、人心上要发生严重的影响”；又利用窃取的中华全国总工会副委员长的职权，在一九二六年召开的第三次全国劳动大会上发表演说，公然提出：“今后职工运动之方针，应作各种经济争斗。……经济争斗之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展。”使经济主义的工运路线在中国工人运动中取得“合法”的地位。
    就是他，在以后中国革命的各个历史时期，写文章、作报告、发指示，竭力鼓吹什么“要以工人的日常经济要求作为动员工人的口号”；要“忠实为达到群众的经济要求而斗争”；“工会是一个经济组织，主要解决工人切身生活问题，为工人切身生活而斗争”；罢工只能提“工人群众最迫切的要求”等等。他并以反对
  “左倾”、“关门主义”和“冒险主义”为借口，攻击工人运动“一味为政治任务而斗争”，反对“在群众经济要求上加上政治口号和政治要求”。甚至在抗日反蒋斗争时期，工人阶级在罢工中，也被规定“只能提当时当地的经济要求，不能提过高过‘左’的政治要求。”而他所谓的过高过“左”的政治要求，竟是指的“反对日本帝国主义”。他就是这样攻击工人阶级抗日反蒋的政治斗争，长帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的志气，灭工人阶级的威风。
    还是他，在全国解放后继续露骨地反对工人阶级的政治斗争，宣扬什么“生产运动就是工人运动”，鼓吹物质刺激和钞票挂帅，大搞全民工会、福利工会，教训工人去“欢迎”资本家的剥削。他并把这一套修正主义货色向国外推销，反对各国工人阶级进行革命的武装斗争。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，又是他，通过他的代理人，用经济主义这个反革命武器，向无产阶级司令部进行疯狂的反扑，妄图挽救他覆灭的命运。
    一条黑线，多么清楚！一双黑手，何其恶毒！
    什么“工人运动模范”、“中国工人运动领袖”！统统都是欺骗！他是一个投降资产阶级的“模范”，是工人运动中机会主义的“领袖”，是遗臭万年的大工贼！
    为了推销这一套反革命机会主义的货色，他挖空心思，胡诌了种种所谓理由来作为依据。
    一曰：“经济要求，是群众的目的”，“经济问题，工人在所必争”。
    这完全是诡辩！
    的确，工人阶级在旧社会受着极为沉重的剥削，过着牛马不如的生活，因此，工人阶级面临着严重的经济问题，他们是要为解决“经济问题”而斗争的。但是，工人阶级在共产党的领导下，经过长期的阶级斗争，越来越清楚地看到：为了从根本上解决免除剥削的“经济问题”，不能仅仅依靠经济斗争本身去实现，而必须积极展开政治斗争，夺取政权，从根本上推翻资本主义剥削制度。这就是解决“经济问题”的关键所在。列宁说：“无产阶级的基本经济利益只能经过用无产阶级专政代替资产阶级专政的政治革命来满足。”中国的赫鲁晓夫借口“经济问题”而反对工人阶级进行政治斗争，反对工人阶级夺取政权，这就从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他不是把经济斗争放在服从于并服务于政治斗争的适当的位置上，而是按照“经济斗争就是一切”这个机会主义、投降主义的公式，力图欺骗蒙蔽工人群众，使他们迷失方向，忘掉根本，从而使工人运动局限于为资产阶级所容许的狭隘范围内。这就充分暴露了中国的赫鲁晓夫的大工贼的丑恶面目。
    随着阶级斗争的日益尖锐化，统治阶级对待被统治阶级，资产阶级对待无产阶级，一般地说，除了政权这一根本问题之外，在其他问题上，必要时是可以“妥协”、“通融”的。谁都知道，用一些小恩小惠来笼络人心，以保全自己的反动统治，这是现时代那些“文明”的统治者——资产阶级政客们常用的手法。只有那些鼠目寸光的庸人、那些市侩们才会因此而心满意足，才会对那些残羹剩饭的施主感恩戴德；而真正的革命派则要大声怒斥：“谁希罕你这几个臭钱，我们要的是政权！”
    一个工人阶级的政党，在领导工人群众进行革命斗争的时候，是把自己的政策建立在工人阶级长远的、根本的利益的基础之上，还是建立在眼前的、暂时的利益基础之上？这是一个原则问题。列宁说：“临时应付，迁就眼前的事变，迁就微小的政治变动，忘记无产阶级的根本利益，忘记整个资本主义制度、整个资本主义演变的基本特点，为谋取实际的或可以设想的一时的利益而牺牲无产阶级的根本利益，——这就是修正主义的政策。”中国的赫鲁晓夫用“经济要求，是群众的目的”之类的鬼话，来作为他在工人运动中推行经济主义路线的依据，这就恰恰暴露了他的修正主义嘴脸。
    二曰：中国的无产阶级还很“幼稚”，“夺取政权”“是很远的事实，也用不着说很多的话来讨论它”。
    这是什么话？！
    工人阶级能不能夺取政权，具有决定意义的，不是什么工人群众的是否“幼稚”，而是有没有一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级先锋队——共产党，有没有一条为广大群众掌握了的无产阶级革命路线。有了这些条件，工人阶级就能够在革命烈火的考验中，迅速地从“幼稚”变得老练，从不成熟到成熟，就能够克敌制胜，夺取政权。反之，如果被反动派的纸老虎形象吓破了胆，或者被统治阶级施舍的一点儿残羹剩饭迷住了心窍，不搞夺取政权的斗争，苟安现状，坐等革命条件“成熟”，那么，他们只能永远处于被人奴役，受人宰割的地位。这样的教训， 难道在国际工人运动中还少见吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”搞革命而又不教育群众认识“夺取政权”的必要，不发动和组织群众去推翻反动政权，那还算什么革命？用所谓工人阶级的“幼稚”来否认夺取政权的政治斗争的必要，这是彻头彻尾的投降主义论调。
    三曰：“民众的每一个经济斗争，同时就是政治斗争。”
    这更是诡辩！
    什么是经济斗争？列宁说：“经济斗争是工人为争得出卖劳动力的有利条件，为改善工人劳动条件和生活条件而向厂主进行的集体斗争。这种斗争必然是职业性的斗争”。而政治斗争，不论是革命的还是反革命的，都是阶级对阶级的生死搏斗，其中心内容就是政权问题。马克思主义者从来都认为阶级斗争有三种形式：经济斗争、政治斗争、思想或理论斗争。三者是既有联系又有区别的，而最重要的形式则是政治斗争。政治是灵魂，是统帅。政治同经济比较起来，不能不占首要地位。这是马克思主义的根本原理。马克思主义者并不否认经济斗争的意义，但是决不会因为经济斗争而忘记政治斗争，而是在组织群众的经济斗争时，利用这种斗争来教育群众，提高工人的社会主义觉悟，进行推翻资产阶级反动政权的思想准备和组织准备，使经济斗争服从政治斗争的需要，并且迅速地把经济斗争提高到政治斗争的高度。
    列宁说得何其好啊！“因为经济斗争而忘掉了政治斗争，那就是背弃了全世界社会民主运动的基本原则，那就是忘掉了全部工人运动史所教导我们的一切。”中国的赫鲁晓夫企图用这种所谓“经济斗争就是政治斗争”的诡辩来取消工人阶级的政治斗争，并掩盖他对无产阶级革命事业的背叛，只能是欲盖弥彰。
    在民主革命时期，我国工人阶级面临的最大政治斗争，就是党所领导的革命战争，就是在农村建立革命的根据地，发动、组织、武装亿万群众，用农村包围城市最后夺取城市的革命战争，去推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，夺取全国政权。在社会主义革命时期，我国工人阶级面临的最大政治斗争，就是坚定地团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的周围，把无产阶级专政条件下的革命进行到底。中国的赫鲁晓夫，闭口不谈无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。在民主革命时期只叫工人去进行“各种经济斗争”，在社会主义革命时期又鼓吹什么“生产运动就是工人运动”等等，这不是用经济斗争来取代无产阶级的政治斗争又是什么呢？这不是要把工人的革命运动引入经济主义的绝路又是什么呢？
    工人阶级就是要搞政治斗争。工人运动必须是工人阶级的政治运动。早在一百多年以前，马克思主义的创始人就代表全世界工人阶级庄严宣告：“他们的目的只有用暴力推翻全部现存的社会制度才能达到。”毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”这就是工人阶级的政治运动。不搞无产阶级的政治斗争，不搞无产阶级专政，醉心于“经济斗争”，而不去触动反动的社会制度，这种工人运动，是资产阶级也可以接受的。把工人阶级的阶级斗争，局限在“经济斗争”的范围内，把工人运动引向经济主义的轨道，就等于取消工人运动，取消无产阶级革命，这是对无产阶级革命事业最大的背叛。国际工人运动史上的叛徒们就是这样干的。伯恩施坦说过：“运动就是一切，而一般所谓的社会主义的最终目的，实际上是算不得什么的”。俄国经济派宣扬的工人运动的座右铭则是“为改善经济状况而斗争”。中国赫鲁晓夫同他们完全是同一种腔调，同一路货色。
    经济主义的狂热鼓吹者，表面上看来似乎反对搞政治斗争，其实不然。他们是搞政治斗争的。他们搞的是资产阶级的政治斗争。中国的赫鲁晓夫所以一再祭起经济主义这个“法宝”，把它强加到工人运动中去，就是因为他同一切机会主义者一样，是资产阶级的代言人，他要搞的是资本主义，要维护的是资产阶级的利益。在夺取政权之前，他企图用这个“法宝”去反对工人阶级夺取政权的斗争，以维持大地主大资本家的反动统治；在工人阶级夺取政权之后，他用这个“法宝”去削弱和破坏无产阶级专政，以保护资产阶级，保持以他为首的资产阶级司令部，达到在中国复辟资本主义的目的。这就是问题的实质。
    历史是无情的。“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”倒转历史车轮的任何企图都是不能得逞的。伯恩施坦之流的所谓工运理论已经成了历史的笑柄。中国的赫鲁晓夫破坏无产阶级革命事业的种种阴谋诡计，也被我们伟大的领袖毛主席，以及用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，及时戳穿，彻底粉碎。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人阶级，必将扫除各种机会主义的垃圾，踢开前进路上的绊脚石，用强烈的革命风暴，把旧世界冲洗干净，建立起红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！
