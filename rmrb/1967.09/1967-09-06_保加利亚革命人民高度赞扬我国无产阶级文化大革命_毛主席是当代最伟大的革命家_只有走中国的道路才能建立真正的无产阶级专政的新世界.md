	Bulgarian revolutionary people have recently written multiple letters to Chinese comrades, expressing their boundless love for the great leader of the world's peoples, Chairman Mao, and their boundless admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They also highly praise China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	A resident of Sofia wrote in a letter: "Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary of our time. He will lead us to a complete victory over world imperialism. Our eyes are all turned towards Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people, and the Communist Party of China. All oppressed peoples sincerely admire and love our leader Mao Zedong and will defend him as they would their own eyes."

	This resident enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said: "The strategic and wise, brave action taken by the great Communist Party of China is an important measure to thoroughly eliminate imperialism and the running dogs of world imperialism and reactionaries—modern revisionism. We are fully convinced that the proletariat will achieve a complete victory worldwide because there is such a great Communist Party of China, which not only leads the Chinese people but also leads the proletariat and progressive people of the whole world."

	Finally, he, on behalf of the Bulgarian people, sincerely wishes "Long live Chairman Mao! May Mao Zedong Thought shine like the sun over the whole world."

	A Bulgarian worker wrote in a letter with great enthusiasm: "The great proletarian cultural revolution in China is inspiring us. It makes us realize that to overthrow the old world and build a new world of genuine proletarian dictatorship, we must follow the path of the great Chinese people. We know that the great Communist Party of China and the great, experienced, and brilliant leader, Chairman Mao, have led the Chinese people from victory to victory, setting an example for the laboring people of our country and the whole world. The Communist Party of China has saved the international communist movement and powerfully exposed those who attempt to betray the fruits of our communist movement."

	He continued: "We firmly believe that our leader, who is also your leader, Chairman Mao, will lead us to thoroughly eliminate the wolves that oppress and deceive our proletariat, so that the proletariat can achieve genuine liberation. Therefore, we laboring people day and night wish for the great savior of humanity, Chairman Mao, to live long and shine upon us like the sun forever."

	Another Bulgarian citizen wrote to Chinese comrades: "In my contact with the masses, I feel that almost all workers and peasants here love the great leader Chairman Mao. Our hearts are all with the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao."

	He said: "The Soviet revisionists have completely exposed themselves in the Arab world and Europe; they are approaching their end, and we workers and peasants are all clear about this."

	He added: "All of us say that there is no Communist Party here; there is only a bourgeois party. Our working class is in poverty. We yearn to see the works of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao."

	This citizen concluded his letter with a shout: "Long live the great Chinese people! Long live the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao!"

　　保加利亚革命人民高度赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命
　　毛主席是当代最伟大的革命家
　　只有走中国的道路才能建立真正的无产阶级专政的新世界
    新华社五日讯　索非亚消息：保加利亚革命群众最近多次写信给中国同志，表示他们对世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限崇拜，并高度赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位索非亚居民在信中说：“毛泽东是当代最伟大的革命家，他将领导着我们彻底战胜世界帝国主义。我们的眼光都在向着毛泽东、伟大的中国人民和中国共产党。一切被压迫的人民都衷心地敬仰和热爱我们的领袖毛泽东并要象保护自己的眼珠一样来保卫他。”
    这位居民热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“伟大的中国共产党采取的这一战略性的和英明、勇敢的行动，是彻底消灭帝国主义和世界帝国主义与反动派的帮凶——现代修正主义的重要措施。我们完全相信，无产阶级一定会在全世界取得彻底胜利，这是因为有了象这样伟大的中国共产党，她不仅领导着中国人民，也领导着全世界无产阶级和进步人类。”
    最后，他代表保加利亚人民衷心祝“毛泽东同志万寿无疆，毛泽东思想象太阳一样普照全世界”。
    一位保加利亚工人在信中热情洋溢地说：“中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命在鼓舞着我们，它使我们体会到，要想推翻旧世界，建立真正的无产阶级专政的新世界，只有走伟大的中国人民的道路。我们知道，伟大的中国共产党和她的久经考验的、天才的伟大统帅毛泽东同志领导的中国人民由胜利走向了胜利，这给我国和全世界劳动人民树立了榜样。中国共产党拯救了国际共产主义运动并有力地揭穿了那些企图出卖我们共产主义运动果实的人。”
    他接着说：“我们深信，你们的领袖也是我们的领袖毛泽东同志，将领导着我们彻底清除压迫和欺骗我们无产阶级的这群豺狼，使无产阶级得到真正的解放。因此我们劳动人民日夜祝愿人类的伟大救星毛泽东同志长寿，祝他象太阳一样永远照耀着我们。”
    另一个保加利亚公民写信告诉中国同志说：“我同广大群众接触中感到，我们这里几乎所有的工人、农民都热爱伟大的领袖毛泽东主席。我们的心都向着以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党。”
    他说：“苏联修正主义者在阿拉伯世界和欧洲面前已完全暴露了自己，他们已开始接近末日，我们工人、农民都清楚这一点。”
    他还说：“我们所有的人都说，我们这里不存在共产党，存在的只是资产阶级的党。我们工人阶级处于贫困之中。我们渴望见到最敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志的著作。”
    这个公民在信中最后高呼：“伟大的中国人民万岁！中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
