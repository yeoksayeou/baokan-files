New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock recently published a statement in the party's organ, the weekly *Voice of the People*, denouncing the Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to shift the blame for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Southeast Asia onto the Chinese people through its mouthpiece, *Izvestia*. The statement exposes the Soviet revisionist clique's hostility towards the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, their role as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, and their treacherous betrayal of the world's revolutionary people.

The statement says: "The Soviet revisionist leadership has reached a new depth of treachery against the world's people by covering up U.S. imperialism's actions to dominate the world. This depth has been revealed in the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia*, which shifts all the blame for U.S. aggression and the establishment of brutal regimes in East Asia onto China!"

The statement says: "*Izvestia* absurdly claims that the U.S. intensification of its rule over India, Indonesia, Thailand, 'Malaysia', the Philippines, and Japan is China's fault. *Izvestia* says that even the U.S. sending over 400,000 troops to South Vietnam and its pirate-style bombing of North Vietnam is China's fault. This newspaper even lists China's development of nuclear weapons—a defensive measure—as the cause of U.S. (war) escalation."

The statement points out: "All these deliberately deceptive absurdities mean that socialist China should not support the anti-feudal, anti-imperialist revolutions in Southeast Asia. Because it is said that this would make the CIA and the Pentagon, these two tools of U.S. imperialism, more active and more ferocious."

The statement goes on to discuss how imperialism is the root cause of modern wars and points out: "Imperialism makes socialist revolution inevitable, just as imperialist war is inevitable."

The statement exposes how U.S. imperialism, in its quest to dominate the world, pursues a policy of nuclear blackmail on the brink of war.

The statement says: "This strategy can only work by frightening its intended victims into submission. Unfortunately, it has only frightened a group of unprincipled, power-hungry usurpers who have seized control of the Soviet Union."

The statement points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership, "to cover up their cowardly desertion from the anti-imperialist battlefield, have dressed up their old theories of 'peaceful coexistence' and 'peaceful competition' as 'creative Marxism-Leninism.'"

"The Marxist-Leninists call these 'theories' revisionism."

The statement emphasizes that the role played by the Soviet revisionists in their dealings with U.S. imperialism to jointly dominate the world is, "to try to resist the truly creative Marxism-Leninism of today—Mao Zedong Thought."

The statement says: "Mao Zedong Thought is not frightened by U.S. imperialism's nuclear brinkmanship 'policy.' Mao Zedong Thought holds that 'imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers,' and nuclear weapons are also paper tigers.

"Mao Zedong Thought holds that true power belongs to the people. The people will destroy imperialism and (atomic) bombs, not the other way around."

The statement points out: "This is the background to *Izvestia*'s slander against China. It is not China's red light that incites U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression, but the green light from the Soviet revisionist leadership."

The statement concludes by saying that *Izvestia*'s slander against the great Chinese people is "just another example of the thief crying 'catch the thief,' shifting the real blame onto others."

    新共总书记威尔科克斯痛斥苏修反华的卑劣行径
    苏修的诽谤损害不了伟大的中国
    新华社墨尔本九日电　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯最近在新共机关报《人民之声》周报上发表声明，痛斥苏联修正主义领导集团通过它的喉舌《消息报》颠倒黑白，妄图把美帝国主义在东南亚的侵略罪责推到中国人民身上的卑鄙行径。声明揭露了苏修集团敌视战无不胜的毛泽东思想，充当美帝帮凶，出卖世界人民革命的叛徒嘴脸。
    声明说：“苏联修正主义领导卑鄙地背叛世界人民、掩盖美帝国主义称霸世界的行动，已经达到一个新的深度。这一深度已经从苏联报纸《消息报》透露出来，《消息报》把美国在东南亚发动侵略和扶植残暴政权的一切罪责推到中国身上！”
    声明说：“《消息报》特别离奇地说，美国加紧对印度、印度尼西亚、泰国、‘马来西亚’、菲律宾和日本的统治是中国的过错。《消息报》说，甚至连美国派四十多万军队去越南南方和对越南北方的海盗式的轰炸也是中国的过错。这家报纸还特别列举中国发展核武器——一种防御手段，说这引起了美国的（战争）升级。”
    声明指出：“所有这些蓄意骗人的荒唐话意味着，社会主义的中国不应该支持东南亚的反封建、反帝国主义的革命。因为据说这样就会使中央情报局和五角大楼这两个美帝国主义的侵略工具变得更加活跃和更加凶恶。”
    声明接着论述了帝国主义制度是现代战争的根源，并且指出：“帝国主义使得社会主义革命成为不可避免，就象帝国主义战争不可避免一样。”
    声明揭露美帝国主义为了实现称霸世界的野心而推行核讹诈的战争边缘政策。
    声明说：“这个战略只有把它预定的受害者吓呆了才能起作用。不幸，它只吓呆了那一帮篡夺了苏联领导的毫无原则的野心家。”
    声明指出，苏修领导集团“为了掩盖他们从反帝战场上开小差的怯懦行为，他们把‘和平共处’和‘和平竞赛’的旧理论梳装打扮一番，称为‘创造性的马克思列宁主义’。
    “马克思列宁主义者把这些‘理论’叫做修正主义。”
    声明强调指出，苏联修正主义者在同美帝搞共同主宰世界的交易中扮演的真正的特殊的角色是，“设法抵制当代真正的创造性的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想”。
    声明说：“毛泽东思想是美帝国主义的核边缘‘政策’所吓不倒的。毛泽东思想认为：‘帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎’，核武器也是纸老虎。
    “毛泽东思想认为，真正的力量属于人民。人民将消灭帝国主义和（原子）弹，而不是反过来。”
    声明指出：“这就是《消息报》造谣攻击中国的背景。煽动美帝国主义扩大侵略的不是中国的红灯，而是苏修领导的绿灯。”
    声明最后说，《消息报》对伟大中国人民的诽谤，“只不过是贼喊捉贼，把真正的罪责嫁祸于人的又一例而已。”
