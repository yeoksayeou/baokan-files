In just a few days since the issuance of our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a wave of revolutionary great unity has rapidly swept across the country. The Shanghai working class has taken the lead, with a "seize the day" revolutionary spirit, achieving revolutionary great unity, setting a brilliant example for us proletarian revolutionaries.

However, there are still some comrades in our revolutionary ranks who are influenced by petty-bourgeois factionalism, hindering the realization of revolutionary great unity. They "occupy the mountain and declare themselves kings," holding onto the big stone of "me as the core" and unwilling to eliminate factions, implement revolutionary great unity. We believe that comrades who engage in factionalism, sectarianism, and "internal warfare" in this way, whether intentionally or unintentionally, are helping the class enemy. Because the enemy fears nothing more than the proletarian revolutionaries uniting, fears nothing more than being isolated, and is most pleased with the proletarian revolutionaries remaining divided forever. We must shout at these people: "Comrades, you cannot do this anymore, hurting those close to you and pleasing those who hate you! You cannot help the class enemy!"

We must learn from the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries, respond most firmly and swiftly to Chairman Mao's call, stop "internal warfare," eliminate factions, and contribute the greatest effort to promote the early realization of revolutionary great unity in our units.

　　向上海工人阶级学习
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席的最新指示发布的短短几天中，一个革命大联合的热潮迅速在全国各地兴起。上海工人阶级一马当先，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，实现了革命的大联合，为我们无产阶级革命派树立了光辉的榜样。
    但是，我们革命队伍中，还有一部分同志被小资产阶级派性所左右，阻碍着革命大联合的实现。他们“占山为王”，抱着“以我为核心”的大石头不放，不愿意铲除山头，实行革命的大联合。我们认为，这样搞山头、闹宗派、打“内战”的同志，不管有意无意，都是在帮阶级敌人的忙，为阶级敌人向无产阶级反扑提供方便。因为敌人最害怕无产阶级革命派团结起来，最怕自己孤立，最喜欢无产阶级革命派永远分裂下去。我们要向这些人大喝一声：“同志，你们不能再干这种亲者痛仇者快的事，你们不能帮阶级敌人的忙！”
    我们一定要向上海无产阶级革命派学习，最坚定最迅速响应毛主席的号召，停止“内战”，铲除山头，为促进本单位革命大联合早日实现贡献最大的力量。		    河北大学一红卫兵
