Liaozhengzhi Office's Representative in Tokyo Strongly Condemns Sato's "Visit" to Taiwan
Sato's Enmity Towards the Chinese People Will Surely Lead to His Downfall
Taiwan is Sacred Chinese Territory; the Chinese People Will Definitely Liberate Taiwan and Will Not Allow Any Foreign Intervention

NEW DELHI, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) - The representative of the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo, Wu Shudong, issued a statement of protest at a press conference in Tokyo on September 8, strongly condemning Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, in defiance of the strong opposition from the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the peoples of Asia, brazenly "visited" Taiwan and colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been overthrown by the Chinese people. This is a serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people and a major crime of direct interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. We express our utmost indignation and strongly protest against this.

At present, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shakes the world, the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is achieving victory after victory, and the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. The U.S. imperialists are in a desperate situation, surrounded by the peoples of the world. Facing this favorable situation, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are terrified and are desperately trying to save their dying fate. Recently, the U.S. and Soviet heads of state made a global counter-revolutionary deal at the Glassboro talks. Sato Eisaku, following the instructions of his American masters, after "visiting" Seoul and colluding with the Park Chung-hee puppet regime, went to Taiwan to engage in activities. This is obviously to serve the U.S. imperialists in their efforts to forge an "East Asian military alliance" aimed at invading China, and to act as the vanguard of the aggressive U.S. imperialists against China. This is not only a serious provocation against the 800 million people of China and Japan but also a serious provocation against the peoples of the entire Asian continent.

It is well known that there is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan has been an inseparable part of Chinese territory since ancient times. The Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan. The liberation of Taiwan is purely an internal affair of China, and no foreign interference will be tolerated. Sato Eisaku's brazen "visit" to Taiwan is a blatant act of the Sato government following the U.S. imperialists in creating "two Chinas" and opposing the Chinese people, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

The Sato cabinet is the most pro-American and reactionary cabinet in the history of post-war Japan. Since Sato took office, he has consistently followed the U.S. imperialists, opposed China, and repeatedly conspired to create "two Chinas," attempting to encroach upon China's territory of Taiwan. Recently, he has become even more brazen. Sato has shamelessly advocated "non-interference," "peaceful coexistence," "development of trade," and other such nonsense, which are all sheer lies.

It must be pointed out that Sato Eisaku's "visit" to Taiwan is a serious step by the Sato government to completely sabotage the relations between China and Japan, and is another ugly exposure of the Sato government's active participation in the international anti-China chorus of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. The Chinese people will not stand idly by and allow this.

The series of pro-American, anti-Soviet, anti-China, and anti-people policies pursued by the Sato government are diametrically opposed to the interests of the Japanese people who demand national independence, friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The broad masses of the Japanese people will never accept this. The Japanese people will rise up to resist, to defend the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and to firmly oppose the Japanese reactionaries' hostility towards China.

The Miyamoto revisionist clique's frenzied anti-China activities have completely betrayed the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people. They are willing to act as the anti-China running dogs of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Sato government. This traitor and modern-day scab, the Miyamoto clique, will be spat upon by the Japanese people and will suffer a shameful defeat. The Japanese people will surely raise the banner of revolution and advance to victory in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reaction.

Promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, developing trade, and people-to-people exchanges are the common aspirations of the peoples of both countries. The Chinese and Japanese peoples have a long history of traditional friendship, and in the struggle against common enemies, they have forged a fighting friendship. We believe that this friendship will continue to develop in the future struggle. The friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples is unbreakable by any force. Anyone who tries to obstruct and sabotage the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples will surely suffer a crushing defeat.

We warn the Sato government: the 700 million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not to be trifled with. Your various misdeeds will surely backfire and you will not have a good end.

As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Those who are determined to follow the Americans and let the U.S. imperialists lead them by the nose will ultimately become sacrificial offerings for U.S. imperialism."

　　廖承志办事处驻东京代表强烈谴责佐藤“访问”台湾
　　佐藤与中国人民为敌必将碰得头破血流
　　台湾是中国的神圣领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾，绝不允许任何外国势力干涉
　　新华社东京八日电  廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表吴曙东，八日在东京举行的记者招待会上发表一项抗议声明，强烈谴责日本首相佐藤荣作“访问”台湾。声明全文如下：
　　日本首相佐藤荣作不顾中国人民、日本人民和亚洲人民的强烈反对，悍然“访问”台湾，同早已被中国人民推翻了的蒋匪帮加紧勾结，这是与七亿中国人民为敌的严重的政治挑衅，是直接干涉中华人民共和国内政的重大罪行。对此，我们表示极大的愤慨并提出最强烈的抗议。
    当前，伟大的毛泽东思想光辉普照全球，中国无产阶级文化大革命震撼世界，英雄的越南人民抗美救国斗争节节胜利，亚非拉人民革命蓬勃发展，美帝国主义陷于世界人民重重包围、走投无路的境地。面对着这种大好形势，世界上的帝修反怕得要死，竭力企图挽救他们垂死的命运。不久前，美苏头目在葛拉斯堡罗会谈做成一笔全球性的反革命黑交易。佐藤荣作秉承美国主子的意旨在“访问”汉城与朴正熙傀儡集团勾搭之后，又去台湾活动，这显然是为美帝国主义加紧拼凑以侵略中国为目的的“东北亚军事同盟”效劳，甘当侵略成性的美帝国主义的反华急先锋。这不仅是对八亿中日两国人民的严重挑衅，也是对整个亚洲人民的严重挑衅。
    众所周知，中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。台湾，自古以来就是中国的神圣领土不可分割的一部分。中国人民一定要解放台湾。台湾的解放完全是中国的内政问题，绝不允许任何外国势力干涉。佐藤荣作悍然“访问”台湾，是佐藤政府明目张胆地追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”、敌视中国人民的罪恶行径，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    佐藤内阁是战后日本历届内阁中最亲美最反动的内阁。自从佐藤上台以来，一贯追随美帝国主义，敌视中国，不断阴谋制造“两个中国”，妄图染指我国领土台湾。最近，更变本加厉。佐藤还恬不知耻地一再标榜什么“互不干涉”、“和平共处”、“发展贸易”等等，这完全是彻头彻尾的骗人的鬼话。
    必须指出，佐藤荣作“访问”台湾是佐藤政府蓄意全面破坏中日两国关系的严重步骤，是佐藤政府积极参加帝修反国际反华大合唱的丑恶面目的又一次大暴露。中国人民对此绝对不能置之不理。
    佐藤政府所奉行的一系列亲美联苏反华反人民的反动政策，是同要求民族独立、要求日中两国人民友好和发展日中贸易的日本人民的利益背道而驰的，广大日本人民是绝对不会答应的。日本人民必将起来反抗，为维护日中两国人民的友谊，反对日本反动派敌视中国进行坚决斗争。
    宫本修正主义集团疯狂反华，完全背叛了日本人民的革命事业，甘心充当美帝、苏修和佐藤政府的反华走卒。宫本集团这个叛徒、当代的新工贼，必将被日本人民所唾弃，遭到可耻的失败。日本人民必将高举革命的大旗，在反对帝修反的斗争中胜利前进。中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    增进中日友好，发展两国贸易和人事往来，是两国人民的共同愿望。中日两国人民有着悠久的传统的友好关系，而且在反对共同敌人的斗争中结成了战斗友谊。我们相信，这种友谊必将在今后的共同斗争中不断发展。中日两国人民的友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的，谁想阻挠和破坏中日两国人民的友谊，谁就必将碰得头破血流。
    我们正告佐藤政府，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不是好惹的。你们的种种倒行逆施，必将自食恶果，是不会有好下场的。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的，“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
