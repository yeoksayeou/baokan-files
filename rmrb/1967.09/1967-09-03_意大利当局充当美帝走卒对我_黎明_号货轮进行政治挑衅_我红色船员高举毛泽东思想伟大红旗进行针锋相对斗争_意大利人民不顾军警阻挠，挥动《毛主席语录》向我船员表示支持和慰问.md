The Italian authorities, acting as lackeys of U.S. imperialism, have provoked the Chinese cargo ship "Dawn" that arrived at the port of Genoa, Italy. This has sparked great indignation among the entire crew of the "Dawn" and the staff of the Chinese Commercial Council in Italy. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displaying a fighting spirit and engaging in a resolute struggle against the fascist actions of the Italian authorities.

The Chinese cargo ship "Dawn," loaded with goods for Sino-Italian trade and the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Italian people, arrived at the port of Genoa, Italy, on August 13. The ship was adorned with quotations from Chairman Mao and banners reading "Salute to the Italian working people!" and "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Italian people!"

The Italian authorities were enraged and terrified by the quotations from Chairman Mao and the banners on the Chinese ship. They interfered by demanding the removal of the quotations. The Chinese captain and the responsible person from the Chinese Commercial Council in Italy immediately rejected the Italian authorities' unreasonable demands, sternly pointing out that Chinese sailors have the sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought on their own ship, and this right cannot be interfered with by anyone for any reason.

The Italian authorities, enraged and humiliated, ordered the representative from the Chinese Commercial Council in Italy who was on the ship to leave immediately, and demanded that the "Dawn" leave the port immediately. After these unreasonable demands were rejected, the Italian authorities, on the afternoon of August 13, dispatched a large number of armed military police to surround the "Dawn" by land and sea, cutting off all communication with the outside world, preventing loading and unloading operations, and restricting the movement of Liu Ruoming, the deputy representative of the Chinese Commercial Council in Italy. Since August 13, the Italian authorities have continuously adopted fascist methods of refusing to supply fresh water and food to the "Dawn," attempting to force the Chinese sailors to surrender. The deputy director of the Genoa Port Authority even threatened to arrest the captain of the "Dawn" and forcibly escort the "Dawn" out of the port.

For more than twenty days, the entire crew of the "Dawn" and the staff of the Chinese Commercial Council in Italy have bravely and tenaciously fought against the fascist actions of the Italian authorities, displaying the heroic spirit of the Chinese people who are unyielding and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. On August 13, after the Italian military police surrounded the cargo ship, the entire crew of the "Dawn" immediately held a meeting, deciding to fight to the death. They unanimously declared: "Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned; studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the sacred right of Chinese sailors. It is a foolish dream to think that Chinese sailors will remove the quotations from Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, from their own ship. This is absolutely impossible." In addition to continuing to hang the original quotations and banners, they also added new banners such as "Strongly protest the illegal order to leave the port!" and "Strongly protest the Italian authorities' creation of a serious political provocation against the Chinese people!" They dropped all anchors and hung a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao on the deck, holding a protest meeting, loudly reciting quotations from Chairman Mao, singing revolutionary songs, and expressing their determination to fight to the end.

In response to the Italian authorities' fascist actions of refusing to supply food and water, the crew of the "Dawn" not only hung new banners and protested loudly through loudspeakers but also expressed solemnly through other means: The Chinese people have dignity; we would rather die standing than kneel to drink your water. To force us to remove the quotations from Chairman Mao is absolutely impossible. They also stated, "The entire crew of the 'Dawn' is prepared to pay any price to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and maintain the dignity of our motherland, ready to shed the last drop of blood, determined to fight to the end against the fascist actions of the Italian authorities."

While bravely and tenaciously fighting against the Italian reactionary authorities, the entire crew of the "Dawn" never forgot to study the works of Chairman Mao and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They seized the time to study relevant quotations from Chairman Mao and works of Chairman Mao in connection with the needs of the struggle. They broadcast quotations from Chairman Mao and revolutionary songs through loudspeakers several times a day and screened the film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" on the deck.

The brave struggle of the crew of the "Dawn" has dealt a heavy blow to the Italian authorities, making them anxious and uneasy.

The just struggle of the crew of the "Dawn" has received widespread support from the Italian people. Since August 13, when the Italian authorities unreasonably sealed off the "Dawn," every day there have been many Italian people who, despite military police obstruction, gathered at the entrance of the dock, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" or waving to the crew of the "Dawn" to express their condolences and support. On August 16, a group of people holding banners broke through the military police blockade to come and express their condolences, but were unlawfully arrested by the Italian authorities. The Chinese sailors on the deck waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang "The Internationale," and shouted slogans, paying tribute to Italian friends and strongly protesting against the atrocities of the Italian authorities.

The Italian Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist) held a mass rally in Genoa on August 21 to support the just struggle of the "Dawn." Representatives of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organization in the Aosta-Turin region brought letters of support to the port of Genoa on two separate occasions to express their support for the Chinese sailors.

On August 23, a large banner reading "Long live Mao Zedong!" appeared in the center of Genoa, expressing the friendship of the Italian people towards the Chinese people, their admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their support for the just struggle of the Chinese sailors.

The anti-China atrocities of the Italian authorities are highly unpopular. Many Italian workers, farmers, and people from all walks of life have written letters to the "Dawn," expressing their support for the struggle of the Chinese sailors and condemning the Italian authorities' provocation against the Chinese cargo ship.

Currently, the entire crew of the "Dawn" is full of confidence, continuing the struggle, determined to fight to the final victory. If the Italian authorities still do not change their ways and continue to act as lackeys of U.S. imperialism, they will only be lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet, and they will not have a good outcome.

　　意大利人民不顾军警阻挠，挥动《毛主席语录》向我船员表示支持和慰问
    新华社二日讯　热那亚消息：意大利当局充当美帝国主义的反华走卒，对到达意大利热那亚港口的中国货轮“黎明”号进行的政治挑衅，激起了“黎明”号全体船员和中国驻意大利商务代表处全体同志的极大愤怒，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬勇敢战斗的精神，对意大利当局的法西斯暴行进行了针锋相对的英勇斗争。
    中国远洋货轮“黎明”号满载着中意贸易物资和中国人民对意大利人民的友谊，于八月十三日抵达意大利北方大港热那亚。船上悬挂着毛主席语录和“向意大利劳动人民致敬！”“中国意大利人民友谊万岁！”等标语。
    意大利当局对于中国船上悬挂的毛主席语录和标语恨得要死，怕得要命，竟然横加干涉，无理要求摘掉语录。中国船长和中国驻意大利商务代表处负责人当即驳斥了意大利当局的无理要求，严正指出：中国船员在自己的船上学习和宣传毛泽东思想，是中国船员的神圣权利，不容任何人以任何借口进行干涉。
    意大利当局恼羞成怒，悍然勒令上到船上的中国驻意大利商务代表处的代表立即离船，“黎明”号“立即离港”。这些无理要求被严正拒绝后，意大利当局十三日下午竟调遣大批武装军警对“黎明”号进行水陆包围，切断它与外界的一切联系，不准进行装卸作业，并且限制中国驻意大利商务代表处副代表刘若明的行动自由。从十三日起，意大利当局一直采取拒绝向“黎明”号供应淡水和食物的法西斯手段，妄图迫使中国船员屈服。热那亚港务局副局长甚至威胁要逮捕“黎明”号船长，使用武力强行押解“黎明”号出港。
    二十多天以来，“黎明”号全体船员和中国驻意大利商务代表处全体同志，对意大利当局的法西斯暴行，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，表现了以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民威武不屈的英雄气概。十三日，意大利军警包围货轮后，“黎明”号全体船员马上举行会议，决心誓死斗争到底。他们一致表示：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢；学习、宣传毛泽东思想是中国船员的神圣权利，要中国船员从自己船上取下中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的语录是痴心妄想，绝对办不到。他们除继续悬挂原来的语录和标语外，还增挂
  “强烈抗议港口当局的非法离港命令！”“强烈抗议意大利当局制造敌视中国人民的严重政治挑衅！”等标语。他们抛下全部船锚，在甲板上挂起伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，举行抗议集会，高声朗诵毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲，表示斗争到底的决心。
    针对意大利当局拒绝供应食水和食品的法西斯暴行，“黎明”号船员除了挂出新的标语和通过高音喇叭提出强烈抗议外，还通过其他途径向意大利当局庄严表示：中国人民是有志气的，宁可站着死，也不会跪着喝你们的水，要想迫使我们取下毛主席语录，万万办不到。他们还表示，“黎明”号全体船员为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想和维护祖国的尊严，准备付出任何代价，不惜流尽最后一滴血，决心同意大利当局的法西斯暴行斗争到底。
    “黎明”号全体船员在同意大利反动当局进行英勇顽强斗争的同时，念念不忘学习毛主席著作和宣传毛泽东思想。他们抓紧时间结合斗争的需要，学习有关的毛主席语录和毛主席著作。他们用高音喇叭每天数次广播毛主席语录，播送革命歌曲，并且在甲板上放映了影片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》。
    “黎明”号船员的英勇斗争给了意大利当局沉重打击，他们的每一行动都使意大利当局惶惶不安。
    “黎明”号船员的正义斗争得到意大利人民广泛的支持。从十三日意大利当局无理封锁“黎明”号起，每天都有不少意大利群众不顾军警阻挠，拥到码头入口铁丝网外，挥动《毛主席语录》或挥手向“黎明”号船员表示慰问和支持。十六日一批群众手持标语冲破军警封锁线前来慰问，遭到意大利当局无理逮捕。中国船员在甲板上挥动《毛主席语录》，高唱国际歌，高呼口号，向意大利朋友致敬，向意大利当局的暴行表示强烈抗议。
    意大利共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）二十一日在热那亚举行群众集会，支持
  “黎明”号的正义斗争。意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）阿奥斯达—都灵地区组织的代表，先后两次带着声援信到热那亚港表示对中国船员的支持。
    二十三日在热那亚市中心出现了一幅写着“毛泽东万岁！”的巨幅标语，表达了意大利人民对中国人民的友谊，对伟大领袖毛主席的崇敬和对中国船员正义斗争的支持。
    意大利当局的反华暴行十分不得人心。不少意大利工人和农民的组织以及各界人士纷纷写信给“黎明”号，表示支持中国船员的斗争，谴责意大利当局对中国货轮的挑衅。
    目前，“黎明”号全体船员正满怀信心，坚持战斗，决心斗争到最后胜利。意大利当局如果还不悬崖勒马，一意孤行，继续充当美帝的反华走卒，那只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，绝对不会有好下场。
