The Soviet revisionist leadership, after staging a fashion show in Britain a few months ago, recently held an unprecedented "International Clothing Exhibition" and "International Fashion Show" in Moscow. They hyped the decadent "Western lifestyle" and promoted so-called "Western civilization," serving their efforts to further restore capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The "exhibition" and "show" were held separately at the "Sokolniki" Park and the "Lenin Sports Palace" in Moscow. They opened on August 22 and concluded on September 5 and 11, respectively. In the months leading up to the opening, the Soviet revisionist leadership mobilized their propaganda machines to drum up support for the "exhibition" and "show," widely publicizing them. After the opening, they published pictures and news in Soviet newspapers. Soviet revisionist leaders Voronov, Mazurov, Polyansky, and Shelepin also attended the events in person.

According to reports, nearly 1,200 clothing companies from around 20 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and West Germany, along with many "fashion models," were invited by the Soviet revisionist leadership to participate in the "exhibition" and "show." They displayed and performed a large number of bizarre Western outfits. Three days after the "exhibition" closed, the chairman of the exhibition organizing committee and the Soviet Minister of Light Industry, Tarasov, shamelessly claimed at a press conference held specifically for the exhibition that this large-scale "display" and "performance" were for the "happiness of people" and served the purpose of "developing international economics" and "consolidating world peace."

The United States is the primary target of the Soviet revisionist leadership's "cooperation" with the West, making it a natural and important "partner" at this "exhibition" and "show." According to the news materials distributed on August 27, the American exhibits were organized with funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce with the assistance of the U.S. State Department. To accompany the performances of American "fashion models," Washington specially sent a jazz band.

The more than 60 fashion shows held at the "Lenin Sports Palace" were even more nauseating.

The fact that such filthy performances were held in a venue named after the great Lenin only shows how far the traitors and scabs like Brezhnev and Kosygin have fallen, and how quickly they are sliding down the path of restoring capitalism.

　　大吹大擂推销西方生活方式　一心一意加紧复辟资本主义
　　苏修举行“时装展览会”乌烟瘴气臭不可闻
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：苏修领导集团几个月前在英国举行“时装表演”之后，最近又在莫斯科举办了一个规模空前的所谓“国际服装展览会”和“国际时装表演会”，大吹大擂地推销腐朽的“西方生活方式”，宣扬所谓“西方文明”，为他们在苏联进一步复辟资本主义效劳。
    分别在莫斯科“索科尔尼基”公园和“列宁体育宫”举行的这次“展览会”和“表演会”，在八月二十二日开幕，先后于九月五日和十一日收场。在开幕前的几个月中，苏修领导集团开动宣传机器，为“展览会”和“表演会”敲锣打鼓，广为宣传。开幕后，又在苏联报刊上登图片，发消息。苏修集团头目沃罗诺夫、马祖罗夫、波利扬斯基、谢列平等，还亲临参观。
    据报道，美、苏、英、法、日、意、西德等二十多个国家将近一千二百家服装公司和许多“服装模特儿”，应苏修集团的招徕，参加了这次“展览会”和“表演会”，展出和表演了大量西方奇装异服。在“展览会”闭幕后的第三天，展览会组织委员会主席、苏联轻工业部长塔拉索夫在为展览会专门举行的记者招待会上恬不知耻地说什么，这次大规模的“展出”和“表演”，是“为了人的幸福”，为“发展国际经济”和“巩固世界和平”的“道路”的目的服务。
    美国是苏修领导集团同西方“合作”的主要目标，在这次“展览会”和“表演会”上是当然的重要“联系”对象。据“展览会”八月二十七日散发的新闻材料报道，展出的美国展品是由美国商业部在美国国务院的协助下出资组织的。为了配合美国“时装模特儿”们的表演，华盛顿专门派来一个美国式的爵士乐队。
    在“列宁体育宫”举行的六十多场“时装表演”，更令人作呕。
    在用伟大列宁的名字命名的“体育宫”里竟然搞出这类乌七八糟的表演，这只能说明勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒、工贼，已经堕落到何等可耻的地步，说明了他们正在复辟资本主义的道路上加速滑下去。
