	When work points lead, bourgeois thought spreads

	Chairman Mao has opened up the broad road of socialist collectivization for us. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party sees this and hates it. He plays all sorts of tricks to oppose our great leader Chairman Mao. He says nonsense like "work points are worthless, the more you don't work, the better," advocating "work points leading."

	Under the influence of this fallacy, our brigade once had a gust of evil wind, with all sorts of work points. There were "toilet points," "hard work points," "additional points," "high subsidy points," "five-good member reward points," "continuous diligence reward points," and so on. This is not enough. During the busy season, work points were even increased to forty. Sometimes, in addition to work points, there were also subsidies of grain and oil, and night meals. Recently, our brigade exposed this unreasonable work point subsidy, and everyone deeply realized that these things are very harmful.

	The living facts tell us that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates work points leading, leading us poor and lower-middle peasants to the brink of disaster, pushing us into the fire pit, making us fall into the trap of work points, only caring about ourselves, and not caring about the big class struggle. This is a soft knife that kills without blood, destroying the development of the collective economy and harming many of our class brothers.

	The day work points lead is the day of peaceful evolution. When work points lead, bourgeois individualism spreads, and members begin to take steps on the capitalist wrong path, and the collective economy is no longer solid. During the three years of natural disasters, under the influence of the slogan "rely on the collective for food, rely on oneself for money" proposed by the capitalist-roader in power within the Party, some members were in the collective but thought of themselves, pursued work points, did not care about the quality of farm work, and the phenomenon of "fast piecework, slow daily work, and not working if work points are low" appeared.

	Due to being poisoned by "work points leading," some members think of various ways to make money, using one heart in ten ways, and not putting their hearts into the team. When farming, some do not apply fertilizer, some do not sow seeds, some plow the land with "thin ends, thick middle, and more careless in remote plots."

	The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates "work points leading," aiming to restore capitalism. Material incentives are a slow-acting poison. After taking this poison, the vision becomes shorter and shorter, and the private thoughts become heavier and heavier, walking further and further on the wrong path. If this goes on, the socialist economy will collapse, capitalism will be restored, and we broad poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer. The heart of the Chinese Khrushchev is so vicious!

	Through the great criticism, we broad poor and lower-middle peasants have seen through the tricks of the "work points leading" advocated by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. We have a clearer understanding that working is for the revolution, for socialism, not for work points. Work points and material inducements cannot shake our red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always highlight the politics of the proletariat, and follow Chairman Mao's broad road of socialist collectivization for life. Let the "work points leading" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

### 工分一挂帅，资产阶级思想就泛滥

　　工分一挂帅，资产阶级思想就泛滥
　　黑龙江省依安县通宽公社兴旺大队支部书记　王洪田
    毛主席给我们开辟了社会主义集体化的阳关大道。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，看在眼里，恨在心里，施展条条毒计，同我们伟大领袖毛主席唱对台戏。他胡说什么“工分不值钱，大家越不干”，鼓吹“工分挂帅”。
    在这一谬论的影响下，我们大队曾刮起一阵邪风，这个分、那个分一大堆。什么“跟腚分”，“辛苦分”，“附加分”，“高额补贴分”，“五好社员奖励分”，“连勤奖励分”等等。这还不算，一到大忙季节，工分甚至增加到四十分。有时除工分外还补助面、粮，吃夜饭。最近我们大队揭发了这种不合理的工分补贴，大家深深认识到这些东西坑人不浅。
    活生生的事实告诉我们，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹工分挂帅，是把我们贫下中农领上绝路，推进火坑，让我们钻进工分里，只顾自己，不关心阶级斗争的大事。这是一把杀人不见血的软刀子，破坏了集体经济的发展，暗害了我们不少阶级弟兄。
    工分挂帅之日，就是和平演变之时。工分一挂帅，资产阶级个人主义就泛滥，社员就开始往资本主义邪路上迈步了，集体经济也就不巩固了。在三年自然灾害期间，在党内走资本主义道路当权派提出什么“吃粮靠集体，花钱靠自己”的口号影响下，有的社员人在集体，心想自己，追求工分，不顾农活质量，出现了“包工快，日工磨，工分少了不干活”的现象。
    由于中了“工分挂帅”的毒，有的社员各想来钱道，一个心眼十下用，没心往队里用劲。种地时，有的不上粪，有的不点种，有的铲地是“两头细，中间粗，偏僻地块更马虎”。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“工分挂帅”，目的就是复辟资本主义。物质刺激是一服慢性毒药。吃了这服毒药，眼光越看越近，私心越来越重，在邪道上越走越远。这样下去，社会主义经济就要垮台，资本主义就要复辟，我们广大贫下中农就要遭殃。中国赫鲁晓夫的用心是多么狠毒！
    通过大批判，我们广大贫下中农，认清了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“工分挂帅”的鬼把戏。我们更清楚地理解到干活是为了革命，是为了干社会主义，不是为工分。工分收买，物质引诱，都动摇不了我们忠于毛主席的一颗红心，我们贫下中农就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级的政治，跟毛主席走一辈子社会主义集体化的康庄大道。让中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“工分挂帅”见鬼去吧！
