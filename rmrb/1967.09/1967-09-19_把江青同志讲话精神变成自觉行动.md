	Seriously study, widely publicize, and resolutely implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, turning it into conscious action.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, the revolutionary masses of Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, Qinghai, and Shanxi, as well as the troops stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, have all expressed their determination to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the "three-in-one combination," do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform within their units, and do a good job in supporting the army and loving the people and the "three supports and two militaries" work, to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	The revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City have issued notices, respectively, requiring all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations to seriously study and discuss Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, and carry out extensive publicity activities to make the speech's spirit known to every household and understood by people of all ages, truly turning the speech's spirit into the conscious revolutionary actions of each individual. Many factories, enterprises, rural people's communes, schools, and institutions in Harbin City have pointed out in their study and discussion sessions that Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is a great battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to us. We must seriously study, widely publicize, and resolutely implement it. The most important task facing us at present is to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism. The most crucial issue facing us is to achieve the revolutionary great alliance. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, be the vanguard in carrying out the revolutionary criticism, and be the model in promoting and achieving the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We must prevent a handful of class enemies from taking advantage of the chaos to fish in troubled waters and thoroughly smash their plots to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and sabotage and split the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the great People's Liberation Army.

	The standing committee members of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee have seriously studied and discussed Comrade Jiang Qing's speech. They believe that Comrade Jiang Qing's speech correctly analyzes the current good situation of the Cultural Revolution in our country. From the perspective of Guizhou's revolutionary situation, it is also very good. They have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance to achieve new and great victories in the Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism after studying Comrade Jiang Qing's speech.

	The revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and broad revolutionary masses in Shandong Province have expressed their firm support and resolute implementation of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech. The leaders of the Revolutionary Rebel Command of Jinan Diesel Engine Factory said that after studying Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, our direction of struggle is clearer, our confidence in victory is greater, and our determination to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end is stronger. We will definitely hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism and launch a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism throughout the factory to thoroughly criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev. The Red Guards of Shandong Normal University and Shandong Medical College have expressed their determination to further do a good job in supporting the army and always stand together with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and win together.

	The "August 18th" revolutionary cadres of Qinghai Province have discussed Comrade Jiang Qing's speech enthusiastically after listening to the recording and have expressed their determination to resolutely implement the battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, do a good job in the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and supporting the army and loving the people.

	Comrade Jiang Qing's speech has greatly inspired the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shanxi Province. The soldiers of the Shanxi Electric Power Revolutionary Rebel Corps have said that the situation of the Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province is good and getting better. To achieve more brilliant victories in the Cultural Revolution, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, do a good job in criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and production, do a good job in supporting the army and loving the people, and raise our revolutionary vigilance to prevent the sabotage activities of class enemies.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, the revolutionary cadres of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Beijing, the broad cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Beijing, and the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" in Shanghai have been studying and discussing Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech delivered on September 5 at the Anhui delegation meeting in Beijing with great excitement. They unanimously believe that Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is an important battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. The speech correctly analyzes the current good situation of the Cultural Revolution and puts forward new battle tasks for the revolutionary cadres, which is the greatest concern, encouragement, support, and urging for us. They have firmly expressed their determination to always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and together with the broad revolutionary cadres, raise the "three supports and two militaries" work to a new level and achieve new merits for the people in the Cultural Revolution.
