We have a million reasons to unite, but no reason to split;
We have a million reasons to unite, but no reason to engage in factional struggles;
We have a million reasons to overcome the petty-bourgeois factionalism that hinders the revolutionary great alliance, but no reason to let bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts run rampant.

A true proletarian revolutionary must, from the perspective of the revolutionary whole, serve the interests of the proletariat as a whole, discard the narrow personal or small-group interests, and contribute all their strength to the urgent need for a revolutionary great alliance with the leftists as the core.

Only those petty-bourgeois revolutionaries are eager to wage internal wars, seek fame, and compete for reputation. In their minds, the interests of their own organization and faction are paramount, and personal interests are paramount.

Do you disagree with my views?—No, I will take "revolutionary action" against you!
Do you want to speak a few words of justice within the revolutionary faction?—No, you are "playing the middleman," you are practicing "revisionism"!

In short, only they are the "resounding" revolutionaries, only they are the most revolutionary and correct. In their eyes, my organization is large, my numbers are many, I have status, I have reputation, without me, it won't work! I am everything! Therefore, the revolutionary great alliance can only be "with me as the core." These are all manifestations of petty-bourgeois factionalism, and are not proletarian party spirit, nor are they the attitude that a true proletarian revolutionary should have. If it retains its position in the revolutionary ranks, it will not be conducive to the realization of the revolutionary great alliance, and will inevitably drag a serious political struggle onto the wrong path of factional struggles without principles.

We have a common enemy, a common revolutionary goal, and a common combat mission. We also have an unbreakable combat friendship that has been tested by more than a year of stormy class struggle. Thinking of all this, what reason do we have to split? We should definitely unite and combine forces. Let us closely unite under the boundless red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance courageously along the proletarian revolutionary line indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 有千万个理由联合，没有一个理由分裂

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    有千万个理由联合，没有一个理由分裂
    我们有千万个理由要联合，没有一个理由闹分裂；
    我们有千万个理由要团结起来，没有一个理由搞派别斗争；
    我们有千万个理由克服妨碍革命大联合的小资产阶级的派性，没有一个理由让资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想自由泛滥。
    真正的无产阶级革命派，必然会从革命的大局出发，服从无产阶级的整体利益，抛弃个人或小集团狭隘的私利，为迫切需要实现的以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，贡献自己的全部力量。
    只有那些小资产阶级的革命者，他们才热衷于打内战，出风头，争名誉。在他们的心目中，本组织、本派别的利益高于一切，个人的利益高于一切。
    你不同意我的观点么？——不行，我对你采取“革命行动”！
    你要在革命派内部讲几句公道话么？——不行，你这是“和稀泥”，是搞“改良主义”！
    总之，只有自己才是“响当当”的革命派，只有自己才最革命、最正确。在他们看来，我的组织大，人数多，有地位，有声誉，离开了我不行！我就是一切！因此，革命的大联合只能“以我为核心”。这些都是小资产阶级派性的反映，而决不是无产阶级的党性，决不是真正的无产阶级革命派应有的态度。在革命队伍中，倘若保留了它的地位，就不利于实现革命的大联合，就必然要把一场严肃的政治斗争拉向无原则的派别斗争的邪路上去。
    我们有共同的敌人，有共同的革命目标，有共同的战斗任务，我们还有经过一年多疾风暴雨的阶级斗争考验的牢不可破的战斗友谊。想到这一些，我们还有什么理由要搞分裂呢？我们完全应该团结起来，联合起来。让我们紧密地团结在光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，沿着毛主席指引的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
