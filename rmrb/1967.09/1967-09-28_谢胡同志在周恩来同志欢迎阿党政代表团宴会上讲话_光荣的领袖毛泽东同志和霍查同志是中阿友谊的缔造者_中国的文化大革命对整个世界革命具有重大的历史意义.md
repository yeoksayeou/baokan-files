Comrade Shehu's Speech at the Banquet Hosted by Comrade Zhou Enlai to Welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation

The Glorious Leader Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha Are the Founders of Sino-Albanian Friendship

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China Has Great Historical Significance for the Entire World Revolution

New China News Agency, September 27th

Comrade Shehu's speech at the banquet hosted by Comrade Zhou Enlai to welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation is as follows:

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrade Chen Boda, Dear Comrade Kang Sheng, Dear Comrade Jiang Qing, Dear Comrades and Respected Friends:

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation is extremely pleased to have the opportunity to visit the great China, which is in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together with the 700 million Chinese people.

The extremely warm and touching welcome we have received in fraternal China, as well as Comrade Zhou Enlai's very warm words about the Albanian people, the Party of Labor of Albania, and our country at this grand banquet, reflect the great fighting friendship and unbreakable Marxist-Leninist unity between our two peoples, our two parties, and our two fraternal countries. Although we are geographically far apart, the great and unbreakable friendship unites us as one. Just as our two peoples with revolutionary ideals are great, our friendship is also great. This friendship is unbreakable because it is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The founders of this friendship are our two parties, our glorious leaders Comrade Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The two countries of China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are connected. No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." The great leader of the Chinese people and the great friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong, these words have tremendous revolutionary significance and are deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Albanian and Chinese peoples. These words have become a great material and spiritual force, further strengthening our brotherly friendship and unity.

Our Party and the leader of our people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, in speaking about the great Albanian-Chinese friendship, said: "Our unity is strong and unbreakable, our friendship is eternal, because our unity and friendship are based on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Because our two parties and peoples, in all fronts of struggle against imperialism and revisionism, are guided by the same goals and the same Marxist-Leninist thought."

On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the great victory of the Chinese revolution, at the height of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Albanian delegation has come to our ally—the great country of yours.

Eighteen years ago, the victory of the Chinese revolution was the most important event in human history after the great October Socialist Revolution because it freed a quarter of humanity from imperialist oppression and capitalist exploitation, and set the great China on the path to socialism and communism, fundamentally changing the balance of international forces in favor of socialism. The victory of the great Chinese revolution, led by the glorious Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, personally and brilliantly in accordance with the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, sounded the death knell for international imperialism and the bell for the victory of socialism throughout the world. Therefore, not only the Chinese people, but also the Albanian people, and all revolutionary people around the world who have boundless admiration and love for the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong, also celebrate this historic day.

This year's October 1st holiday has special significance because it is being celebrated in the atmosphere of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this great revolution, hundreds of millions of Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have risen up with an irresistible momentum, smashing the counter-revolutionary headquarters of the bourgeoisie and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The historic decision of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened by Chairman Mao last August, has opened a new and significant stage in the revolutionary development of people's China and on the road to socialism and communism. The fundamental significance of the decision of the Eleventh Plenum lies in determining, in accordance with the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Marxist-Leninist path to ensure that the great socialist China will never change its red revolutionary face, and determining the path to follow for the greatest event since the victory of October 1, 1949—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The struggle between socialism and capitalism, between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, is intensifying on an international scale, continually promoting the complete collapse of imperialism, the complete rot of modern revisionism, and the complete upsurge of the struggle of the peoples of all countries for freedom and independence, and the complete upsurge of revolution. At this moment, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is advancing vigorously with the momentum of millions of troops. In this international situation favorable to revolution and unfavorable to the enemies of revolution and the people, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only has great historical significance for the Chinese people but also for the peoples of all countries and for the entire world revolution.

The international significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China lies in the fact that it is sweeping away the dust and filth of bourgeois revisionism in the People's Republic of China with a revolutionary broom; in the fact that it is bombarding and smashing the headquarters of revisionism headed by China's Khrushchev, which is the last hope of international modern revisionism to "capture the fortress from within" through China's number one revisionist and his followers; in the fact that it is overthrowing and crushing the agents of the bourgeoisie and imperialism who are trying to bury the great achievements of Mao Zedong, to destroy the socialist system of China.

Therefore, the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique have formed an anti-China crusade to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. They are afraid of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought, afraid of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For us revolutionaries, this is a great thing.

Therefore, the Party of Labor of Albania and the entire Albanian people support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and sincerely wish for its victory, for the benefit of the Chinese working class and people, for the benefit of the world revolution, for the benefit of socialism and communism. This is the will and position of our people and our Party.

Dear Comrades and Friends:

The Albanian people are united as one, rallying around the Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, firmly engaged in labor and struggle to implement the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and the great program for the further continuous revolutionization of national life. In our socialist Albania, the movement for the further comprehensive revolutionization of national life is advancing successfully.

Emphasizing proletarian politics, constantly strengthening the mass line, constantly consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, correctly handling non-antagonistic contradictions within the people, conducting class struggle in accordance with the interests of the working class and along the socialist path, eliminating backward customs and religious superstitions, the laboring masses mastering Marxist-Leninist thought, further improving socialist production relations and further increasing productivity, and making the superstructure more in line with the socialist economic base—these are the main contents of the revolutionary measures that our Party has already taken and is continuing to take to further revolutionize the entire national life.

In accordance with the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and based on the specific conditions of our country, the ultimate goal of the further continuous revolutionization of national life in our country is to achieve the final victory of the socialist path in Albania, thus avoiding the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania, ensuring that the People's Republic of Albania will never change its revolutionary face, and that the banner of Marxism-Leninism will forever fly high and unfaded in socialist Albania.

Dear Comrades, Respected Friends:

The current developments in international affairs more fully demonstrate that in the face of the increasingly intense struggle of the peoples of all countries who love freedom, American imperialism, openly and secretly in collusion with the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique led by Kosygin and Brezhnev, is doing everything it can to strengthen its role as the international gendarme in all parts of the world.

In Vietnam, the American imperialists are facing imminent disaster, and they are desperately trying to use the help of the Soviet revisionist clique to get out of this disaster, forcing the heroic Vietnamese people to "surrender" to American imperialism at the "peace negotiation table." The heroic Vietnamese people have not surrendered in the past and will not surrender now; they are waging a heroic struggle. They show the world that a small nation's people can defeat the greatest imperialist power, can defeat the military might of the United States. Our people, our Party, and our government will support the heroic Vietnamese people to the end.

The criminal aggression of imperialism-Israel against the Arab countries in June this year, in front of the whole world, especially in front of the Arab people, once again exposed the bloodthirsty nature of the American aggressors and the nature of the Soviet revisionist clique as loyal servants of American imperialism, proving that the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Albania, and other anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist countries and forces in the world are the true friends of the peoples of all countries struggling for freedom and independence, especially the true friends of the Arab people. The recent events in the Middle East have made those who truly oppose imperialism more clearly understand, as the great Lenin said, that the struggle against imperialism, if separated from the struggle against revisionism, cannot be victorious.

The counter-revolutionary criminal alliance between American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique is taking increasingly open forms and contents. The purpose of the alliance between imperialism and revisionism is to annihilate world socialism, extinguish the flames of the liberation struggle of the peoples of all countries, and for the United States and the Soviet Union led by the Khrushchev revisionist clique to dominate the world.

Great China under the leadership of Mao Zedong is the number one enemy and main obstacle to the realization of the criminal plans of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. Therefore, their arrows are all aimed at the People's Republic of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. However, it is fortunate for all humanity and the world revolution that the existence of this great socialist country of China commands American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism: "Halt!" China has become a force that will make the criminal plans of imperialism and revisionism completely bankrupt. Great China is so great because it has the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. Great China, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become even stronger.

Our delegation firmly believes that the friendly visit of our delegation to our ally China will further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, our two parties, and our two countries, to the benefit of our two peoples, to the benefit of socialism and communism. No force in the world can destroy this great friendship. Imperialism cannot destroy it, the Soviet Khrushchev cannot destroy it, and the Chinese Khrushchev cannot destroy it. Today, we fight together, and in the future, we will continue to fight together; today, we win together, and in the future, we will continue to win together. Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism illuminate our common path. Time is on our side, or rather, we compel time to serve us, to serve socialism and communism.

Dear Comrades, please allow me to take this opportunity to represent our delegation, the Albanian people, the Party of Labor of Albania, and our government, and our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the great and glorious leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, on the great October 1st National Day, wishing you a happy holiday, wishing you greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, wishing you greater achievements in the construction of socialist society, and wishing Comrade Mao Zedong eternal life!

Dear Comrades, Respected Friends, please allow me to raise my glass:

To the great and eternal fighting friendship between the Albanian people and the great 700 million Chinese people,

To the great and heroic Chinese people,

To the glorious Communist Party of China,

To the great October 1st holiday,

To the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

To the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding and glorious Marxist-Leninist, and the noble friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong,

To the health of Vice Chairman Lin Biao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,

To the Government of the People's Republic of China, to the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai,

To the health of Comrade Chen Boda,

To the health of Comrade Kang Sheng,

To the health of Comrade Jiang Qing,

To the health of the envoys present,

To the health of all friends present,

To the glory of Marxism-Leninism,

Cheers!

    谢胡同志在周恩来同志欢迎阿党政代表团宴会上讲话
    光荣的领袖毛泽东同志和霍查同志是中阿友谊的缔造者
　　中国的文化大革命对整个世界革命具有重大的历史意义
    新华社二十七日讯　谢胡同志在周恩来同志欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的陈伯达同志，亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的江青同志，亲爱的同志们和尊敬的朋友们：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国党政代表团感到万分高兴能有机会来到正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的伟大中国进行友好访问，并同七亿中国人民一起欢度中华人民共和国建国十八周年这个伟大的节日。
    我们代表团在兄弟的中国受到的极为热情和极为动人的欢迎，以及周恩来同志在这个隆重的宴会上对阿尔巴尼亚人民、劳动党和我国所讲的十分热情的话，体现了我们两国人民、两党和两个兄弟国家之间的伟大的战斗友谊和牢不可破的马克思列宁主义的团结。我们在地理上相距很远，但是伟大的牢不可破的友谊把我们团结得象一个人一样。正如有着革命理想的我们两国人民是伟大的，我们的友谊也是伟大的，这一友谊是牢不可破的，因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的，因为这一友谊的缔造者是我们两党，是我们的光荣领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志。
    毛泽东同志说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。……不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大朋友毛泽东同志的这些话，有着巨大的革命意义，在阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民中间是深入人心的；这些话已经变成了巨大的物质力量和思想力量，进一步加强了我们的兄弟友谊和团结。
    我们党和我国人民的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志在谈到伟大的阿中友谊时说：“我们的团结是坚强的，牢不可破的，我们的友谊是永恒的，因为我们的团结和友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的牢固基础上的，因为我们两党和两国人民在各条战线上进行的反对帝国主义和修正主义的共同斗争，都是以共同的目标和共同的马克思列宁主义思想为指导的。”
    在中国人民的伟大节日——中华人民共和国成立十八周年前夕，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，阿尔巴尼亚代表团来到了我们的盟邦——你们伟大的国家。
    十八年前中国革命的胜利，是伟大十月社会主义革命以后人类历史上最重要的事件，因为它使人类的四分之一摆脱了帝国主义压迫和资本主义剥削，使伟大的中国走上了通向社会主义和共产主义的道路，使国际力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的彻底变化。光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义学说亲自英明领导的伟大中国革命的胜利，敲响了国际帝国主义的丧钟，敲响了社会主义在全世界取得胜利的钟声。因此，不仅中国人民，而且阿尔巴尼亚人民，以及对伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和对毛泽东同志无限敬佩和爱戴的全世界革命人民，也都庆祝这个历史性的日子。
    今年十月一日的节日有着特殊意义，因为它是在无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大胜利的气氛中来庆祝的。在这场大革命中，中国亿万工、农、兵和红卫兵，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，已经行动起来，以不可阻挡之势，摧毁反革命资产阶级修正主义司令部和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    去年八月毛泽东主席主持召开的中国共产党十一中全会的历史性决定，在人民中国的革命发展的历史上，在社会主义和共产主义的道路上，开辟了具有特殊意义的新阶段。十一中全会决定的根本意义，在于根据毛泽东同志的思想，马克思列宁主义地确定了保证伟大的社会主义中国永不改变鲜红的革命面貌所应遵循的道路，确定了一九四九年十月一日胜利以来最伟大的事件——无产阶级文化大革命所应遵循的道路。
    国际范围内社会主义和资本主义、马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间的斗争正在全面展开，并不断促使帝国主义全面崩溃，现代修正主义全面腐烂，各国人民为自由、独立的斗争全面高涨，革命全面高涨，在这样的时刻，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命正在以千军万马之势，蓬勃地向前发展着；在这种有利于革命、不利于革命和人民的敌人的国际形势下，中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅对中国人民，而且对于世界各国人民，对于整个世界革命都具有重大的历史意义。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的国际意义，在于它用革命的扫帚在中华人民共和国清除资产阶级修正主义的灰尘和污垢；在于它炮轰和摧毁以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义司令部，这个司令部是国际现代修正主义企图通过中国的头号修正主义分子及其追随者“从内部来夺取堡垒”的最后一个希望；在于它打倒和击溃妄图葬送毛泽东的伟大业绩、消灭中国的社会主义制度的资产阶级和帝国主义的代理人。
    因此，以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏联修正主义集团为中心的现代修正主义者组成了反华的大十字军，反对无产阶级文化大革命和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志。他们害怕毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想，害怕无产阶级文化大革命。对于我们革命者来说，这是一件大好事。
    因此，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚全国人民支持中国无产阶级文化大革命，并衷心祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利，以有利于中国工人阶级和中国人民，有利于世界革命，有利于社会主义和共产主义。这就是我国人民和我们党的意志和立场。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民万众一心，团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党周围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，为胜利贯彻劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议和使国家生活进一步不断革命化的宏伟纲领而坚定地进行着劳动和战斗。在我们那里，在社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，国家生活的进一步全面革命化运动正在卓有成效地向前发展。
    突出无产阶级政治，不断加强群众路线，不断巩固工人阶级专政，正确处理人民内部的非对抗性矛盾，根据工人阶级的利益和遵循社会主义的道路进行阶级斗争，消除落后习俗和宗教迷信，劳动群众掌握马克思列宁主义思想，进一步改进社会主义生产关系和进一步提高生产力，以及使上层建筑更加适应社会主义经济基础——这些都是我们党为使整个国家生活进一步不断革命化所已经采取和正在采取的革命化措施的主要内容。
    依据马克思列宁主义学说和根据我国的具体条件，我国国家生活进一步不断革命化的最终目标，是使社会主义道路在阿尔巴尼亚取得最后胜利，从而避免在阿尔巴尼亚产生修正主义和复辟资本主义，使阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国永不改变革命面貌，使马克思列宁主义的旗帜在社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚永远高高飘扬，永不褪色。
    亲爱的同志们，尊敬的朋友们：
    当前，国际事态的发展更充分地说明，面对着各国爱好自由人民日益高涨的斗争，美帝国主义公开地和秘密地勾结以柯西金和勃列日涅夫为首的苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，千方百计地在世界各地加强它的国际宪兵的作用。
    在越南，美帝国主义者面临灭顶之灾，它竭力企图依靠苏联修正主义集团的帮助，摆脱这场灾难，迫使英雄的越南人民“在和平谈判桌上”屈服于美帝国主义。英雄的越南人民，过去没有屈服，现在也没有屈服，他们正在进行英勇无比的斗争。他们向全世界人民表明，一个小国人民是能够战胜最大的帝国主义国家的，是能够战胜美国的军事力量的。我国人民，我们党和我国政府，将对英雄的越南人民支持到底。
    今年六月帝国主义—以色列对阿拉伯国家的罪恶侵略，在全世界面前，特别是在阿拉伯人民面前，再一次暴露了美国血腥侵略者的本性，暴露了苏修集团是美帝国主义的忠实奴仆的本质，证明了中华人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和世界其他反对帝国主义、反对修正主义的国家和力量是正在为自由、独立而斗争的各国人民的真正朋友，特别是阿拉伯人民的真正朋友。最近的中东事件使那些真正反对帝国主义的人更加清楚地懂得，也正如伟大列宁所说的，反对帝国主义的斗争如果同反对修正主义的斗争分开，就不可能取得胜利。
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团之间的反革命罪恶联盟，正在采取日益公开的形式和内容。帝国主义和修正主义结成这种联盟的目的就是要消灭世界社会主义，扑灭各国人民解放斗争的烈火，并由美国和以赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团为首的苏联两大国主宰世界。
    毛泽东的伟大中国是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者实现罪恶计划的头号敌人和主要障碍。所以他们的矛头都指向人民中国和毛泽东同志。但是，全人类和世界革命感到十分幸运的是，中华人民共和国这个社会主义大国的存在，它喝令美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义：“住手！”中国已经成了使帝国主义和修正主义的罪恶计划彻底破产的力量。伟大的中国所以如此，是因为有毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，伟大的中国经过无产阶级文化大革命，变得更加强大了。
    我们代表团坚定不移地相信，代表团在我们的盟友中国的友好访问，必将进一步加强我们两国人民、两党和两国之间的牢不可破的友谊，有利于我们两国人民，有利于社会主义和共产主义。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这个伟大的友谊。帝国主义破坏不了，苏联的赫鲁晓夫破坏不了，中国的赫鲁晓夫也破坏不了。今天，我们战斗在一起，今后仍将战斗在一起；今天，我们胜利在一起，今后仍将胜利在一起。马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义照耀着我们共同的道路。时间有利于我们，或者更确切地说，我们迫使时间为我们服务，为社会主义和共产主义服务。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我借此机会代表我们代表团，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚党和政府，代表我们敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，衷心祝愿兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民伟大的光荣的领袖毛泽东同志伟大的十月一日国庆节节日愉快，祝你们无产阶级文化大革命取得越来越大的胜利，祝中国在建设社会主义社会中取得日益巨大的成就，祝毛泽东同志万寿无疆！
    亲爱的同志们，尊敬的朋友们，请允许我举杯：
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的七亿中国人民之间伟大的、永恒的战斗友谊，
    为伟大的、英雄的中国人民，
    为光荣的中国共产党，
    为十月一日伟大的节日，
    为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，
    为中国人民伟大的领袖、卓越的光荣的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民的尊贵的朋友毛泽东主席的健康，
    为中国共产党中央委员会副主席林彪同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国政府，为周恩来同志的健康，
    为陈伯达同志的健康，
    为康生同志的健康，
    为江青同志的健康，
    为在座的使节们的健康，
    为全体在座的朋友们的健康，
    为马克思列宁主义的光荣，
    干杯！
