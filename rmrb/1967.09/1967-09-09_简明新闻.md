	Workers of the Ford Motor Company in the United States, numbering 160,000, began a nationwide strike on the 7th. This strike has paralyzed 93 Ford factories and parts warehouses across 25 states, severely impacting the already troubled U.S. economy, which is riddled with problems. The strike has further exposed the U.S. government's predicament as it is mired in the Vietnam War.

	The United Press International expressed grave concern, warning that the strike "will severely shock the already unstable (U.S.) economy."

	A group of West German students held a protest in Frankfurt on the Main River on the 6th, condemning U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	Former Labor Minister Sipalo has been appointed as the new Agriculture Minister. However, Sipalo immediately resigned. He announced his withdrawal from the cabinet and the United National Independence Party.

	Soviet Revisionists Curry Favor with Japanese Government by Opening Arctic Route

	The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has been intensifying its comprehensive collusion with the Japanese Sato government, recently opened a new Arctic route from Europe to Japan. The Soviet ship "Novovoronezh" has already arrived at the port of Yokohama, Japan, on this route on August 25th.

	This Arctic route follows the Soviet Arctic coast, which has not been open in the past. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique has opened this route to Japan solely to curry favor with the Sato government and to meet the needs of the developing "cooperation" between the Soviet Union and Japan.
