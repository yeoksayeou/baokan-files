Forty years ago, at a critical juncture when the Chinese revolution suffered severe setbacks, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising. The Autumn Harvest Uprising and the march to Jinggangshan established the first new-type revolutionary armed forces of workers and peasants, created the first revolutionary base area, and opened up a new revolutionary path for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. This has epoch-making significance in the history of the Chinese revolution and in the history of our army's construction.

		(One)

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

Under the white terror created by Chiang Kai-shek, the bloody facts declared the complete bankruptcy of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line. At that time, a sharp question facing people was: should revolutionary struggles be abandoned and surrender to the enemy's butcher's knife? Or should weapons be taken up to continue the fight? It was precisely at this critical juncture in the development of the Chinese revolution that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao defeated the right-opportunist line represented by Chen Duxiu, saving the Party and the Chinese revolution.

Only by taking up arms and using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution can the Chinese people be led to liberation. It was under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong that the "August 1" Nanchang Uprising fired the first shot against the reactionary Kuomintang. Subsequently, "the red flag was raised, and the serfs' spears were rolled up." Based on the peasant movement in Hunan, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Autumn Harvest Uprising. This was a great turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution and marked the great beginning of the Chinese revolutionary movement's victory under Chairman Mao's correct line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao not only thoroughly criticized Chen Duxiu's right-opportunism but also criticized the "left" adventurism. At that time, another sharp question facing our Party was: what path should the Chinese revolution take? The "left" opportunists dreamed of launching uprisings in the enemy-occupied central cities and quickly achieving revolutionary victory nationwide. Our great helmsman Chairman Mao, with the genius and wisdom of Marxism-Leninism, soberly assessed the domestic and international class struggle situation, correctly analyzed the political and economic conditions of Chinese society and the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and proposed the famous slogan of "armed struggle of workers and peasants." He also pointed out: "The task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter into insurrection and war through long-term legal struggle, nor is it to first occupy cities and then take the countryside, but to take the opposite path." The vanguard of the proletariat must go deep into the countryside, mobilize the peasants to establish revolutionary base areas, surround the cities with the countryside, and through long-term, arduous armed struggle, finally seize the cities and seize national power. This is a brilliant example of Chairman Mao combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution, and a great creative development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." One of the great historical achievements of the Autumn Harvest Uprising was the beginning of the establishment of a new-type people's army absolutely led by the Communist Party of China under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought.

How can a people's army, unprecedented in Chinese history, be built? In the early days of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, Chairman Mao, in the sharp struggle against the bourgeois military line, formulated a complete proletarian military program for our army.

From the very beginning of establishing the Red Army, Chairman Mao firmly grasped the fundamental issue of building the army with proletarian politics commanding the military and proletarian ideology arming the troops.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Military affairs are only one of the tools for completing political tasks." "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." "The Red Army is not just about fighting; apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also has to undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary governments, and even building Communist Party organizations."

Chairman Mao's series of scientific judgments fundamentally resolved the relationship between politics and the military, determining the nature and fundamental tasks of the Red Army.

From the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, the military has always been a tool of class struggle. The bourgeois army is a tool for the bourgeoisie to suppress and plunder the working people. The bourgeoisie always tries to cover this up and dare not admit the class nature of the military. The proletariat, on the other hand, must vigorously propagate this viewpoint, making every soldier understand the principle of military subordination to politics, and thus consciously and actively struggle to achieve the political tasks of the proletariat.

In the early days of the Red Army, Chairman Mao specifically stipulated for the Red Army the three major tasks of fighting, fundraising (later changed to production), and doing mass work, and formulated the famous "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, whenever the Red Army arrived at a place, it immediately went deep into the masses, carried out propaganda and organizational activities, actively mobilized the masses, established revolutionary governments and various mass organizations, established guerrilla units and Red Guards, and other people's armed forces, carried out guerrilla warfare, developed the land revolution, and continuously expanded and consolidated rural base areas. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of military subordination to politics, regarded doing mass work as the most important political task. The Red Army was both a combat unit and a work unit and a production unit. As a result, the army deeply rooted itself among the masses, completely blending with the masses, and thus gained an inexhaustible and boundless power.

To make the Red Army truly "an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," Chairman Mao emphasized the need to place the troops under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of China and to ensure that "the Party commands the gun, and the gun does not command the Party." Chairman Mao personally led the historic Sanwan reorganization, which prominently solved this fundamental issue. Chairman Mao summarized the experience of the First Revolutionary Civil War and decided to establish party branches at the company level, establish party committees at the battalion and regiment levels, and appoint party representatives at all levels above the company. This ensured the Party's absolute leadership in the Red Army and gave the troops a political soul and leadership core.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Red Army was able to fight tenaciously without collapsing because 'party branches are established at the company level.'" At that time, the entire revolutionary situation was at a low ebb, and the young Red Army, which had just been established, faced a difficult situation. Powerful enemies continuously launched "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, and various non-proletarian thoughts seriously existed within the Red Army. Due to the establishment of party branches at the company level, with party members and activists as the backbone, mobilizing the masses to carry out political and ideological work, the branches became a strong combat fortress to ensure victory in battle and complete various tasks. This ensured that the Red Army, under any difficult and challenging conditions, in the severe test of battle, could "overcome all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy," and "as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight."

Chairman Mao said: "The Red Army's material life was so meager, and battles were so frequent, yet it was able to maintain itself without collapse, apart from the role of the Party, it was also due to the implementation of democracy within the army." Implementing a democratic system within the army was a major content of Chairman Mao's political military construction in the early days of the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the Red Army. This democratic system of equality between officers and soldiers was unprecedented in Chinese history. All reactionary armies raised by exploiting classes were tools of the ruling class. Their reactionary nature determined that the relationship between officers and soldiers was one of oppression and being oppressed, forming sharp class antagonism within the army. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, starting from the nature of a people's army led by the proletariat, established a new set of democratic systems under centralized guidance. In the Red Army, cadres treated the soldier masses with the feelings and attitudes of class brothers, and officers and soldiers were politically equal. Revolutionary soldiers' committees were established at the company level, and finances were made public. The implementation of these systems quickly eliminated various bad habits brought from feudal mercenary armies, established a new revolutionary style, built a new type of officer-soldier relationship, mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of soldiers, united officers and soldiers, and fought against the enemy, making the Red Army look completely different. At that time, under the conditions of military encirclement and economic blockade by the enemy, although material life was extremely difficult, the spirit was very happy, especially for some soldiers who had just been liberated from the Kuomintang army. Comparing two fundamentally different armies, their class consciousness quickly improved, and their spirits were liberated. The same soldier, who was a coward in the Kuomintang army yesterday, became a brave soldier in the Red Army today.

		"History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought was formed and developed in the struggle against the bourgeois military line and various non-proletarian thoughts. In the history of our army, the struggle between the two military lines has always been conducted around the fundamental issue of whether politics comes first or the military comes first, and whether politics or the military is emphasized. Those who insist on the bourgeois military line always interfere with and oppose Chairman Mao's correct line. They cling to the single military viewpoint, reducing the three major tasks that Chairman Mao set for the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to just fighting. They shout about how "if the military is good, politics will naturally be good, and if the military is bad, politics will not be good." They want to replace politics first with military first, want the military to lead politics, and publicly propose the absurd slogan of "the command department faces outward," attempting to cancel the Party's leadership over the Red Army, cancel political organs and political ideological work, and lead the Red Army down the path of deviating from proletarian leadership.

Chairman Mao's proletarian military line has repeatedly defeated the bourgeois military line in the struggle. The decision of the Gutian Conference, personally drafted by Chairman Mao and of great historical significance in the history of our army's construction, is a summary of the victory of the struggle between the two military lines in the early days of the Red Army's establishment. This decision criticized various non-proletarian erroneous thoughts, pointing out their manifestations, sources, and methods of rectification. This decision made the Red Army completely established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's military thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Over the decades, the Party's work and political work in our army have developed significantly, and the basic line of military construction is still the correct line formulated by Chairman Mao at that time. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao further summarized the content of political work into the three basic principles of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the army and the people, and the dissolution of the enemy army, playing an immense role in the great struggle to defeat Japanese imperialism. During the War of Liberation, Chairman Mao personally stipulated the development of political, economic, and military democracy as the guiding principles for our army's political work and personally led the entire army to carry out the new-style military rectification movement. This is an important development of our army's political work and democratic movement, playing a major role in consolidating, strengthening, and achieving national victory for the People's Liberation Army.

Decades of struggle practice have fully proven that Chairman Mao's military thought is the most complete, most scientific, and greatest military theory in the history of the development of Marxism, the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism military theory, and the fundamental guarantee for our victory over all powerful enemies and achieving one great victory after another.

		(Three)

Throughout the entire socialist period, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is extremely sharp and complex. This struggle will inevitably be reflected within our army. Chairman Mao teaches us: "From the viewpoint of Marxism's theory of the state, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a powerful army." The bourgeoisie wants to restore power and will definitely seize the army and the gun. The proletariat wants to consolidate its power, to prevent restoration, and will definitely seize the army and the gun. The struggle between the two military thoughts and the two military lines ultimately comes down to the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for control of the military. For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing have stubbornly promoted the bourgeois military line, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. Their evil purpose is to attempt to "reform" our army with the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, making the army a tool for them to seize the Party and seize power, realizing their personal ambitions. It must be seen that after the proletariat seizes power, there is still the danger of losing power for a considerable historical period. After the proletariat seizes military power, there is also the danger of losing military power. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the bourgeois restoration plot is doomed to fail. However, as long as class and class struggle exist, the struggle between the two military thoughts and the two military lines will inevitably exist for a long time and will be particularly intense at certain times.

Since the founding of the nation, the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought and military line and the bourgeois military thought and military line has always been around the fundamental issue of whether to emphasize politics or the military, and whether politics comes first or the military comes first. The Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing have frantically opposed Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's military line. They hysterically shout: Chairman Mao's works are "outdated and no longer applicable," and absurdly say that "military is politics, and military and political should be equally important"; Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing even blatantly shout that "in modern warfare, the main thing is to fight with steel and technology, not with politics and bravery." They vigorously spread the reactionary fallacies that "politics cannot go to heaven" and "politics cannot go to sea."

Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, best student, and our vice-commander Lin Biao, learned, understood, and applied Mao Zedong Thought the best, and held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest. Over the decades, at the turning points in the development of the Chinese revolution and in each struggle between the two lines, he always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line, most bravely, loyally, and thoroughly defended and executed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and systematically expounded and creatively developed Chairman Mao's military thought. The decision of the 1960 enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, chaired by Comrade Lin Biao, inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the Gutian Conference, comprehensively summarized the rich experience of military construction and political ideological work since the founding of the nation under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly rectified the influence of bourgeois military thought and military line on our army, and further established the absolute leadership of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line in our army. Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the Military Commission, he has held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively proposed and emphasized learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, implementing the Four Firsts, advocating the Three-Eight Style, promoting the Three Democracies, and carrying out the Four Good Units movement, and a series of policies, principles, and major measures. He has made the best theoretical exposition and the most loyal and resolute implementation of the great leader Chairman Mao's political military thought and proletarian military line in theory and practice. As Chairman Mao said: "The ideological and political work and military work of the Liberation Army have developed significantly since Comrade Lin Biao proposed the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, becoming more concrete and more theoretical."

Our naval forces, under the personal care of Chairman Mao and the direct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, have vigorously emphasized politics and carried out the mass movement of learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works, changing the spiritual face of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Spiritual power is transformed into material power. Over the years, we have continuously achieved victories in air and naval battles. The facts have proven: it is precisely because we have gone to heaven with politics, gone to sea with politics, and won battles with bravery and human factors. This has thoroughly smashed the shameless lies of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing against emphasizing politics.

The experience of our army's forty years of struggle tells us: without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, without Chairman Mao's political military thought and proletarian military line, we lose our soul, lose our direction, lose our commander, and will inevitably take the wrong path and suffer defeats. We must forever learn from and apply Chairman Mao's political military thought, forever march forward on the road of proletarian military construction as indicated by Chairman Mao.

At this great moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by our great leader Chairman Mao, feeling deeply affectionate and greatly inspired. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At present, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has entered the decisive stage. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively carry out the great criticism movement, and thoroughly criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the tasks of defending national defense and defending the Cultural Revolution, in the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," and in various struggle and work tasks, strive to achieve new merits for the people.

    永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线胜利前进
    ——纪念秋收起义四十周年		张秀川
    四十年前，在中国革命遭受严重挫折的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导了著名的秋收起义。秋收起义和向井冈山的进军，建立了第一支新型的工农革命武装，创建了第一个革命根据地，为中国革命和世界革命开辟了一条崭新的革命道路，在中国革命史和我军的建军史上，具有划时代的伟大意义。
                        （一）
    毛主席教导我们：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    在蒋介石制造的白色恐怖中，血的事实宣告了陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的彻底破产。当时，摆在人们面前的一个尖锐问题是：是取消革命斗争，屈服于敌人的屠刀之下？还是拿起武器，继续战斗？正是在这个中国革命发展的生死关头，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线战胜了以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义路线即投降主义路线，挽救了党，挽救了中国革命。
    只有拿起枪杆子，以武装的革命反对武装的反革命，才能引导中国人民走向解放。正是在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，“八一”南昌起义，打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪。接着，“红旗卷起农奴戟”，在湖南农民运动基础上，毛主席亲自发动和领导了秋收起义，这是中国革命史上一个伟大的转折点，是中国革命运动在毛主席的正确路线指引下走向胜利的伟大开端。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，不但彻底批判了陈独秀右倾机会主义，同时也批判了“左”倾冒险主义的错误。当时，摆在我们党面前的另一个尖锐问题是：中国革命应该走什么道路？“左”倾机会主义者幻想在敌人长期盘踞的中心城市发动起义，迅速取得革命在全国的胜利。我们的伟大舵手毛主席，以马克思列宁主义的天才和智慧，清醒地估量了国内外的阶级斗争形势，正确地分析了中国社会的政治经济情况和中国革命的特点，提出了著名的“工农武装割据”的口号。他还指出：“共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”无产阶级先锋队必须深入农村，发动农民建立革命根据地，以农村包围城市，经过长期的艰苦的武装斗争，最后夺取城市，夺取全国政权。这是毛主席将马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的光辉典范，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的天才的创造性的伟大发展。
                        （二）
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”秋收起义的一个伟大历史功绩，就是在毛主席的建军思想指导下，开始建立了一支由中国共产党绝对领导的新型的人民军队。
    怎样才能建设一支中国历史上从来没有过的人民军队呢？毛主席在中国工农红军初建的时期里，在同资产阶级军事路线的尖锐斗争中，就为我军制定了一套完整的无产阶级的建军纲领。
    一开始建立红军，毛主席就紧紧抓住了用无产阶级政治统帅军事，用无产阶级思想武装部队这个建军的根本问题。
    毛主席指出：“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一”。“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”
    毛主席这一系列的科学论断，从根本上解决了政治和军事的关系，确定了红军的性质和根本任务。
    按照马克思列宁主义的观点，军队从来都是阶级斗争的工具。资产阶级的军队，是资产阶级镇压和掠夺劳动人民的工具。资产阶级总是千方百计地掩盖这一点，不敢承认军队的阶级本质。无产阶级却要大力宣传这个观点，使我们的每一个战士都懂得这个军事服从政治的道理，从而自觉地、积极地为实现无产阶级的政治任务而斗争。
    在红军初建时期，毛主席给红军具体规定了打仗、筹款（后改为生产）、做群众工作三大任务，制定了著名的“三大纪律八项注意”。按照毛主席的教导，当时红军每到一地，就立刻深入群众，展开宣传和组织活动，积极发动群众，建立革命政权和各种群众组织，建立游击队、赤卫队等人民武装，开展游击战争，发展土地革命，不断扩大和巩固农村根据地。当时的工农红军，正是在毛主席军事服从政治的思想指导下，把做群众工作看作头等重要的政治任务。红军既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队。结果，使军队深深扎根在群众之中，完全和群众打成一片，从而获得了取之不尽、用之不竭的无穷力量。
    为了使红军真正成为“一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，毛主席强调必须把部队放到中国共产党的绝对领导之下，必须保证“党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”。毛主席亲自领导的具有历史意义的三湾改编，突出地解决了这个根本问题。毛主席总结了第一次国内革命战争的经验，决定将支部建在连上，营、团成立党的委员会，在连以上各级组织设党代表，这就从组织上保证了党在红军中的绝对领导，使部队有了政治灵魂和领导核心。
    毛主席指出：“红军所以艰难奋战而不溃散，‘支部建在连上’是一个重要原因。”当时，整个革命形势处于低潮，创建不久的年轻的红军，面临着艰难的处境。强大的敌人不断地疯狂“围剿”，红军内部各种非无产阶级思想严重存在。由于在连队建立了党的支部，以党员和积极分子为骨干，发动群众开展政治思想工作，使支部成为保证战斗胜利和完成各项任务的坚强的战斗堡垒。这就保证了红军在无论多么艰苦困难的条件下，在严峻的战斗考验中，能够“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”，“只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”。
    毛主席说：“红军的物质生活如此菲薄，战斗如此频繁，仍能维持不敝，除党的作用外，就是靠实行军队内的民主主义。”在军队内部实行民主制度，是秋收起义和红军初建时期，毛主席从政治上建军的一项主要内容。这种官兵平等的民主制度，是中国历史上没有的事情。一切剥削阶级所豢养的反动军队，都是统治阶级的工具。他们的反动本质，决定了他们的官兵关系是压迫与被压迫的关系，在军队内部，形成了尖锐的阶级对立。毛主席创建的工农红军，从无产阶级领导的人民军队本质出发，建立了一套崭新的集中指导下的民主制度。在红军里，干部以阶级弟兄的感情和态度对待士兵群众，官兵在政治上是平等的。连队建立了革命士兵委员会，经济公开。这些制度的贯彻执行，迅速荡涤了从封建雇佣军队带来的种种恶习，树立了新的革命风气，建立了新型的官兵关系，调动了广大士兵的革命积极性和创造性，官兵一致，团结对敌，使红军部队面目一新。当时在敌人军事围攻和经济封锁的条件下，尽管物质生活极其艰苦，但是精神上却十分愉快，特别是一些刚从国民党军队解放过来的战士，对比了两种根本不同的军队，阶级觉悟迅速提高，精神上得到了解放。同样一个兵，昨天在国民党军队里是个胆小鬼，今天到了红军却变成了勇敢的战士。
      “历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”毛主席光辉的建军思想，就是在和资产阶级军事路线的斗争中，和形形色色的非无产阶级思想的斗争中形成和发展的。在我军历史上，两条军事路线的斗争，一直是围绕着政治第一还是军事第一，突出政治还是突出军事这个根本问题进行的。那些坚持资产阶级军事路线的人，总是干扰和对抗毛主席的正确路线。他们死抱住单纯军事观点不放，把毛主席给工农红军规定的三大任务缩小为单纯打仗。叫嚷什么“军事好，政治自然会好，军事不好，政治也不会好”。要以军事第一来代替政治第一，要以军事领导政治，公开提出“司令部对外”的荒谬口号，妄图取消党对红军的领导，取消政治机关和政治思想工作，把红军引向脱离无产阶级领导的邪路上去。
    毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，在斗争中不断地战胜了资产阶级军事路线。毛主席亲自起草的、在我军建军史上具有伟大历史意义的古田会议决议，就是红军初建时期两条军事路线斗争的胜利总结。这个决议批判了各种非无产阶级的错误思想，指出其表现、来源及纠正的方法。这个决议使红军完全建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上。这是毛主席建军思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    几十年来，我军党的工作和政治工作有了很大的发展，建军的基本路线，还是毛主席当时制定的这一条正确路线。抗日战争时期，毛主席进一步将政治工作内容，概括为官兵一致、军民一致、瓦解敌军这样三条基本原则，在战胜日本帝国主义的伟大斗争中，发挥了无比的威力。解放战争时期，毛主席亲自规定了开展政治、经济、军事三大民主为我军政治工作的方针，并且亲自领导全军开展了新式整军运动。这是我军政治工作和民主运动的一个重要发展，对于人民解放军的巩固、壮大和夺取全国胜利，起了重大的作用。
    几十年来的斗争实践充分证明，毛主席的军事思想，是马克思主义发展史上最完整、最科学、最伟大的军事理论，是当代马克思列宁主义军事学说的最高峰，是我们战胜一切强大的敌人，取得一个又一个伟大的胜利的根本保证。
                        （三）
    在整个社会主义时期，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，极其尖锐、复杂。这种斗争，必然地要在我们军队内反映出来。毛主席教导我们：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”资产阶级要搞复辟，一定要抓军队，抓枪杆子。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，要反复辟，也一定要抓军队，抓枪杆子。两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争，归根结底，就是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级争夺兵权的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿，长期以来，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线，反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线。他们的罪恶目的，就是妄图用资产阶级反动路线“改造”我们的军队，使军队变成他们篡党、篡政，实现个人野心的工具。必须看到无产阶级取得政权以后，在一个相当长的历史时期内，还有失去政权的危险。无产阶级掌握军权以后，也有失去军权的危险。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，资产阶级复辟阴谋是注定要失败的。但是，只要阶级和阶级斗争存在，两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争，就不可避免地长期存在，而且，在一定时期是十分激烈的。
    建国以来，毛主席的无产阶级建军思想、建军路线同资产阶级建军思想、建军路线斗争的焦点，一直围绕着突出政治还是突出军事，政治第一还是军事第一这个根本问题。中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的建军路线。他们歇斯底里地叫喊：毛主席著作“过时了，不适用了”，胡说什么“军事就是政治，军事政治应该并重”；彭德怀、罗瑞卿还公然叫嚷“在现代条件下作战主要就是打钢铁，打技术，而不是打政治，打勇敢”。极力散布“政治不能上天，政治不能出海”的反动谬论。
    毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，我们的副统帅林彪同志，对毛泽东思想学得最好、领会最深、用得最活，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高。几十年来，在中国革命发展的转变关头，在历次两条路线斗争中，他都是旗帜鲜明地、坚定地站在毛主席的正确路线一边，最英勇、最忠实、最彻底地捍卫和执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，并且系统地阐明了和创造性地发挥了毛主席的军事思想。林彪同志主持制定的一九六○年军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，继承和发扬了古田会议的优良传统，在毛泽东思想指导下，全面地总结了建国以来军队建设和政治思想工作的丰富经验，彻底清算了资产阶级建军思想和建军路线对我军的影响，进一步确立了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线在我军的绝对领导地位。林彪同志主持军委工作以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造性地提出和强调了活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，贯彻四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列方针、原则和重大措施，对伟大领袖毛主席的政治建军思想和无产阶级军事路线，从理论上作了最好的发挥，在实践中作了最忠实最坚决的贯彻。正如毛主席所说：“解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。”
    我们的海军部队，在毛主席的亲切关怀和林彪同志直接领导下，大力突出政治，大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，改变了广大官兵的精神面貌。精神力量转化为物质力量。几年来连续获得了空战和海战的胜利。事实证明：我们就是靠政治上了天，靠政治出了海，靠勇敢，靠人的因素打了胜仗。这就彻底粉碎了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿反对突出政治的无耻谰言。
    我军四十年斗争的经验告诉我们：离开了毛泽东思想的指导，离开了毛主席政治建军思想和无产阶级军事路线，就失去了灵魂，失去了方向，失去了统帅，就必然要走错路，打败仗。我们要永远地学习和运用毛主席的政治建军思想，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级建军路线胜利前进。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时候，我们来纪念伟大领袖毛主席领导的秋收起义四十周年，感到无限亲切，无比鼓舞。我们要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。目前，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进入了决战阶段。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极开展革命的大批判运动，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透、斗倒斗臭。我们要积极响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在保卫国防和保卫文化大革命的战斗任务中，在“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务中，在各项斗争和工作任务中，争取为人民立新功。
