After the victory of the democratic revolution and the completion of land reform, where should the 500 million peasants go: should they take the socialist road or the capitalist road? This is one of the focal points of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by China's Khrushchev.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "To achieve the socialist transformation of the entire agricultural sector, that is, to implement collectivization, and to eliminate the rich peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside," "this is the inevitable path for the people to be liberated and for the poor to become rich."

China's Khrushchev, however, sings a different tune, proposing to the peasants a path of "enrichment" based on individual economy, which is the path of developing capitalism.

As early as 1947, he proposed at the Jin-Sui Border Area cadre conference that peasants should "enrich themselves," and that every household should paste up a sign saying "ten thousand ounces of gold."

In the early days of liberation, he openly proposed the slogan of "enrichment," saying: "In the countryside, we have propagated labor enrichment. What is labor enrichment? It is labor to enrich, and peasants like to enrich themselves."

Thousands of years of history have proven that only through exploitation can one enrich oneself. How can one "enrich" through labor? Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years it has been individual economy, one family one household is a production unit, this scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty." Under the conditions of private economy, those who can "enrich" and "become rich" are only the exploiters. The result of the development of individual economy is inevitably the polarization of the rich and the poor, with a small number of people becoming landlords and rich peasants, while the vast majority of peasants suffer bankruptcy.

China's Khrushchev wants peasants to "labor to enrich" and develop into households with "three horses, one plow, and one cart." One household, with three horses, a plow, and a cart, may not be a landlord, but it is a rich peasant. Without exploitation, it is impossible to reach such a level. China's Khrushchev vigorously advocates "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is glorious," even openly advocating: "land rented out for cultivation" "has no restrictions," whether hiring long-term laborers or short-term laborers, or hiring ten or eight or even a hundred, as long as it is one's own land cultivated or hired labor to cultivate one's own land, we should protect it and not infringe upon it." This is his so-called secret of "labor enrichment."

It is clear that China's Khrushchev's slogan of "labor enrichment" is essentially a capitalist slogan for developing the rich peasant economy. He once bluntly declared: The policy of preserving and developing the rich peasant economy "is not a temporary policy, but a long-term policy."

Before the realization of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union, Bukharin also proposed the slogan of "enrich yourselves." He said: "We should tell all peasants, all strata of peasants: enrich yourselves! Accumulate! Develop your economy! Only a fool would say that we should always be poor."

Regarding Bukharin's reactionary fallacy, Stalin had long ago made a profound criticism. He said: "Only a few individuals or groups can enrich themselves," "a few individuals or groups enrich themselves in order to dominate the rest and exploit them." And he pointed out: "'Enrich yourselves' in essence is a call to restore capitalism." In fact, Bukharin himself did not hide his repeated shouts, not to be afraid of the capitalist peasant class, not to be afraid of hired labor, "we must develop the economy of wealthy peasant households." China's Khrushchev and Bukharin are truly birds of a feather.

China's Khrushchev advocates that "peasants like to enrich themselves," which is a great slander against our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought have great socialist enthusiasm and are determined to take the socialist road. What they pursue is not personal enrichment but the liberation of all the people of China and all the people of the world.

China's Khrushchev advocates "labor enrichment," which can only represent the rich peasants, this rural bourgeoisie. His frantic opposition to and sabotage of the agricultural cooperativization movement is a tenacious manifestation of this bourgeois stance.

The wheels of revolution roll forward. History does not change with the will of the bourgeoisie. Whether it is Bukharin of the Soviet Union or China's Khrushchev, they cannot save the doom of capitalism and block the victorious advance of socialism.

### “劳动发财”是发展资本主义的口号

    “劳动发财”是发展资本主义的口号		金川连
    在民主革命取得胜利，土地改革完成以后，五亿农民向何处去：是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点之一。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“实现对于整个农业的社会主义的改造，即实行合作化，在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度”，“这是人民群众得到解放的必由之路，由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却大唱反调，给农民提出了一条在个体经济基础上“发财”的道路，也就是发展资本主义的道路。
    还在一九四七年，他就在晋绥边区干部会议上提出：应该使农民“发财”，让家家户户都贴上“黄金万两”的字条。
    解放初期，他又公然提出“发财”的口号，说：“在农村我们曾经宣传过劳动致富。什么是劳动致富呢？就是劳动发财，农民是喜欢发财的”。
    几千年来的历史证明，只有剥削发财，何来劳动“发财”？毛主席指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。”在私有经济条件下，能够“发财”“致富”的，只有那些剥削者。个体经济发展的结果，必然引起两极分化，极少数人成为地主富农，广大农民则遭到破产。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要农民“劳动发财”，发展成为“三马一犁一车”式的农户。一户人家，发展到有三匹马，一副犁，一辆车，不够个地主，也是个富农。不通过剥削，是决不可能达到这样地步的。中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”，“剥削光荣”，甚至公然主张：“雇人耕种的土地”“没有限制”，无论雇长工也好，雇零工也好，雇十个八个甚至一百个也好，只要是自己耕种或雇人耕种自己经营的土地，我们就应该加以保护，不得侵犯。”这就是他的所谓“劳动发财”的秘诀。
    很清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫的“劳动发财”的口号，实质上就是发展富农经济的资本主义口号。他曾经直截了当地宣称：保存和发展富农经济的政策，“不是一种暂时的政策，而是一种长期的政策”。
    在苏联实现农业集体化以前，布哈林也曾提出过“发财吧”的口号。他说：“应当对全体农民，对农民的所有阶层说：发财吧！积累吧！发展自己的经济吧！只有傻瓜才会说，我们永远应当是穷。”
    对于布哈林的这个反动谬论，斯大林早就作了深刻的批判。他说：“能够发财的只是个别人或个别集团”，“个别人或个别集团发财是为了支配其余的人和剥削他们”。并且指出：“‘发财吧’的口号实质上是号召恢复资本主义。”事实上，布哈林自己也毫不隐讳地一再叫嚷，不要“害怕资本主义农民阶层”，不要“害怕雇佣劳动”，“必须发展富裕农户的经济”。中国赫鲁晓夫和布哈林真是一丘之貉。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“农民是喜欢发财的”，这是对我国广大贫下中农的莫大污蔑。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国贫下中农，有着极大的社会主义积极性，是坚决走社会主义道路的。他们追求的不是个人发财致富，而是全中国人民和全世界人民的解放。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“劳动发财”，只能是代表富农这个农村资产阶级说话。他疯狂地反对和破坏农业合作化运动，正是这种资产阶级立场的顽强表现。
    革命车轮滚滚向前。历史是不以资产阶级的意志为转移的。苏联的布哈林也好，中国赫鲁晓夫也好，都不能挽救资本主义的灭亡，阻挡社会主义的胜利前进。
