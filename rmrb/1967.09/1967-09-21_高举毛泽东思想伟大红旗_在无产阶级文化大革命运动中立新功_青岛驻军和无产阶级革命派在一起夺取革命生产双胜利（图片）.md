The People's Liberation Army garrison in Qingdao holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly supports the broad leftist masses. In the "three supports, two militaries" work, they have made tremendous achievements. This is a responsible comrade from the garrison explaining to the revolutionary youngsters how to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry out a thorough criticism of the revolution.

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit, who are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and are carrying out a powerful revolutionary criticism movement. They are determined to thoroughly expose, criticize, and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing, and to completely eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary military line.

Arming the revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the most fundamental way to serve the people. The People's Liberation Army garrison in Qingdao, while carrying out the "support the left" task, always places the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront, helping various levels of revolutionary committees and mass organizations to establish the system of studying Chairman Mao's works. This is them enthusiastically organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works in the workshops.

The broad soldiers and officers of a certain unit in Qingdao, who have made remarkable achievements in the "three supports, two militaries" work, are determined to even higher hold the great banner of Chairman Mao's "support the army, love the people," and vow to be models of loving the people. They will forever stand together with the proletarian revolutionary masses in unity, struggle, and victory. This is the soldiers signing the covenant of loving the people.

Firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The personnel of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Qingdao, who are responsible for the "support the left" task, closely unite with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fight shoulder to shoulder, and vow to achieve victories in both revolution and production.

Carrying forward the glorious tradition of the army being a fighting force, a working force, and a propaganda force. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit deeply enters the workers, peasants, and soldiers, propagates Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the great criticism, and thoroughly exposes and criticizes the Chinese Khrushchev.

In the high tide of the revolutionary criticism, the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Qingdao are filled with indignation, united in hatred, and verbally and in writing condemn the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing against the party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to wield the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, give a thorough beating to the "falling dogs," and ensure they never rise again.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功
　　——青岛驻军和无产阶级革命派在一起夺取革命生产双胜利
    人民解放军驻青岛某部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持左派广大群众，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了巨大成绩。这是驻军某部负责同志在向革命小将讲如何紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，开展革命的大批判的道理。
    忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的某部指战员，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动，决心把中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清资产阶级反动军事路线的流毒。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命群众，是对无产阶级革命派最大的支援，是最根本的爱民。人民解放军驻青岛某部在执行“支左”任务中，始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，帮助各级革命委员会和群众组织建立起了学习毛主席著作的制度。这是他们深入车间热情地组织群众学习毛主席著作。
    在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了显著成绩的驻青岛某部广大指战员，决心更高地举起毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，誓做爱民模范。永远和无产阶级革命派团结、战斗、胜利在一起。这是指战员们在订爱民公约。
    狠抓革命，猛促生产，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。人民解放军驻青岛某部担任“支左”任务人员，和无产阶级革命派紧密团结，并肩战斗，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
    发扬我军既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是宣传队的光荣传统。解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，在革命的大批判中深入工农兵群众，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫。　　张秉山摄
    在革命大批判的高潮中，人民解放军驻青岛某部广大指战员，怒火万丈，同仇敌忾，口诛笔伐中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。决心奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，痛打“落水狗”，叫它们永世不得翻身。
