The Indian reactionaries recently sent troops from Sikkim to invade the Chinese border and launch a military attack. After being struck back by our brave border defense forces, they fabricated lies to cover up their defeat and aggression. The Indian reactionary government and its propaganda machine have been spreading rumors and making wild statements, resulting in self-contradictions and numerous loopholes, exposing their true colors.

The Indian reactionary government, fearing that the morale of their invading troops would further decline, has been hiding and downplaying the casualties of their troops in this attack. According to reports from Western news agencies, when journalists asked the Indian Defense Ministry spokesman about the casualties of Indian troops, he always had a "sheepish smile" on his face, sometimes avoiding the question, sometimes vaguely saying that the casualties were minimal.

On September 11, the first day of the Indian invasion, their troops suffered heavy casualties. On that day, the Indian Defense Ministry had the audacity to announce to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur reporter that only one Indian soldier was killed and a few were injured. On the 16th, the Chinese border defense forces handed over 14 Indian corpses and weapons abandoned in Chinese territory to the Indian side. The Indian reactionary government was in a panic and on the 22nd, through its mouthpiece, the Indian News Agency, changed its statement about Indian casualties, changing "one Indian soldier" killed to "a number of Indian personnel" killed.

The incident of the Chinese border defense forces returning Indian corpses and weapons in Chinese territory made the Indian reactionaries look foolish. To save face, they immediately had the Indian United News Agency issue a statement from the capital of Sikkim, fabricating that "India and China have reached an agreement to exchange wounded and dead personnel starting today." However, only the Chinese side "returned," and there was no "exchange" from the Indian side, making this lie self-defeating.

To cover up the fact that the Indian invading troops violated Chinese territory, the Indian reactionaries fabricated various absurd statements. The Indian News Agency said on the 18th: "It seems that at 5:40 on September 11, the Chinese suddenly fired at our personnel who were setting up barbed wire, and some of them fell on the Tibetan side and were hit." By the 22nd, the mouthpiece of the Indian reactionary government suddenly changed its tune, saying that the "bodies dragged to their side by the Chinese on the 13th and 14th were lying on or near the barbed wire." According to the Indian reactionaries' statements, the Indian troops were suddenly attacked, so how did their corpses end up inside Chinese territory? The Indian reactionaries could only say one moment that they "fell over," and the next moment that they were "dragged over," truly shameless to the extreme.

The Indian reactionary government's fabrications are too absurd and self-contradictory. Even Indian bourgeois newspapers are worried that such deception will not fool people. The *Politician* newspaper published an editorial on the 21st saying: What exactly happened at the Nathu La Pass is still not clear from the continuous statements of the official spokesmen in New Delhi. The information provided to the press is not only unclear and incomplete but also inconsistent. The letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 11 said that a barbed wire fence was "obviously within Sikkim's territory," but four days later, it became a thin wire used to mark the border, which probably means that this thin wire is on the border. The letter specially mentioned that the purpose of setting up this barbed wire fence was to prevent further invasion, but the official explanation on September 15 was that this was not a defensive barrier. The newspaper is concerned that the Indian government's random statements will raise doubts about the reliability of these statements.

The Indian reactionaries' various distortions fully expose their hypocrisy, weakness, and decay, indicating that their days are numbered.

### 造谣污蔑　胡言乱语　自相矛盾　漏洞百出　印度反动派歪曲侵华真相的谎言不攻自破

　　造谣污蔑　胡言乱语　自相矛盾　漏洞百出
　　印度反动派歪曲侵华真相的谎言不攻自破
    新华社二十五日讯　本社记者报道：印度反动派最近派军队从锡金侵入中国边境，发动武装进攻，遭到我英勇的边防部队迎头痛击后，为了掩盖失败和侵略罪行，印度反动政府和宣传机器大肆造谣污蔑，胡言乱语，结果弄得自相矛盾，漏洞百出，丑态毕露。
    印度反动政府由于害怕侵略军士气更加低落，一直隐瞒和缩小这次进攻中印军的伤亡数字。据西方通讯社报道，当新闻记者询问印度国防部发言人印军伤亡情况时，他脸上总是出现“窘迫的微笑”，有时避而不答，有时含糊其词地说伤亡极少。
    九月十一日，印度侵略军向中国发动进攻的第一天即遭到惨重伤亡，当天印度国防部竟厚着脸皮向德意志新闻社记者宣布，只有一名印军士兵被打死，几名被打伤。十六日，中国边防部队把遗弃在中国境内的十四具印军尸体和武器交给印度方面。印度反动政府慌了手脚，就在二十二日通过它的喉舌印度新闻处，修改了关于印军伤亡情况的说法，把九月十一日“一名”印军士兵被打死，改为“多数印度人员”被打死。
    中国边防部队交还在中国境内的印军尸体和武器这件事，使印度反动派狼狈不堪。它为了挽回面子，当天又让印度联合新闻社从锡金首都发出消息，造谣说什么“印度和中国已经达成协议，从今天起交换死伤人员。”但是，只见中国方面“交”，不见印度方面“换”，这个谎话又不攻自破了。
    为了掩盖印度侵略军侵犯中国领土的事实，印度反动派捏造了各种荒谬不堪的说法。印度新闻处十八日说：“似乎是在九月十一日五时四十分，中国人突然朝正在架设铁丝网的我方人员开火的时候，他们之中有些人倒在西藏一边，被击中了。”到了二十二日，印度反动政府的这个喉舌忽然又改口说，那些“在十三日和十四日被中国人拖到他们那边的尸体是躺在铁丝网上面或者附近的。”按照印度反动派的说法，印度军队是遭到了突然袭击，那么他们的尸体怎么会跑到中国领土以内呢？印度反动派只好一会儿说是“倒过去的”，一会儿又说是“拖过去的”，真是无耻已极。
    印度反动政府造谣造得太荒唐，自相矛盾得太不象话。连印度资产阶级报纸也担心这样胡搞骗不了人。《政治家报》二十一日发表社论说：在乃堆拉山口究竟发生了什么事情，从新德里的官方发言人连续发表的谈话中还没有进一步弄清楚。向报界介绍的情况不仅是不清楚和不全面的，而且也是前后不一致的。外交部九月十一日的照会上所说的“显然是处于锡金领土以内的”一个带刺铁丝网，在四天之后又变成用来标出边界的一根细铁丝，这大概就是说，这根细铁丝是在边界上的。那份照会特别说明，架设这个铁丝网的目的是防止进一步入侵，但是官方在九月十五日解释说，这不是一个防御的屏障。这家报纸担心，印度政府这样乱说一气，会引起人们对这些说法的可靠性的怀疑。
    印度反动派的种种歪曲宣传，充分暴露出它的虚伪、虚弱和腐朽的本质，表明它的日子越来越不好过。
