Indian reactionaries have ripped off their masks and publicly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create "two Chinas," wholeheartedly following the U.S. imperialists in their anti-China stance. They will inevitably reap what they sow.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st

Our correspondent reports: The extremely reactionary and traitorous government of Indira Gandhi in India has recently openly declared its support for the U.S. imperialists' scheme to create "two Chinas." Thus, the Indian reactionary government has joined the ranks of some lackeys of U.S. imperialism (such as the Sato government of Japan) in their plot to create "two Chinas." This is a new and serious step in the Indian reactionaries' intensified anti-China activities.

Indian Deputy Prime Minister Morarji Desai held a press conference in Washington on the 12th. When asked whether the Indian government would support "two Chinas" within the United Nations, he replied: "Why not? There are two territories. Formosa (the term used by U.S. imperialists and reactionaries in various countries to refer to Taiwan) has already been a member of the United Nations, and it is already an independent country today."

Desai's remarks blatantly abandoned the stance of all previous Indian governments, which claimed to recognize only one China and not recognize the Taiwan-based Chiang Kai-shek clique. He openly participated in the anti-China conspiracy of his master, U.S. imperialism, to create "two Chinas" within the United Nations.

According to Indian newspapers, on September 16th, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi discussed with members of the Congress Party. Some members pointed out whether Desai's remarks on the 12th deviated from the policy already announced by the Indian government. Indira Gandhi said: What Desai said in the press conference and statement correctly represents the government's policy.

On September 15th, although the Indian government spokesman still hypocritically expressed that the Indian government's policy of recognizing only the People's Republic of China remains unchanged, when a news reporter asked him whether the Indian government still considers Taiwan to be part of China, this spokesman refused to comment. Indian reactionary newspapers also cheered for Desai's creation of "two Chinas," shouting that "this is a welcome step towards realism," "it is reasonable to say so," and so on.

Desai's remarks in the United States about "two Chinas" are a necessary exposure of the Indian reactionary government's premeditated anti-China policy. In recent years, the Indian reactionary government, following the instructions of its American master, has increasingly frequently and openly colluded with the Taiwan-based Chiang Kai-shek clique. Reactionary officials of the Chiang clique and members of the Indian ruling party and other reactionary parties have been busy shuttling between Taiwan and New Delhi. A delegation composed of leaders of the Indian National Congress and other reactionary parties recently went to Taiwan to participate in the extremely reactionary so-called "First World Anti-Communist Alliance Conference." A delegation from the so-called "China-India-Burma Cultural and Economic Promotion Association" of the Chiang clique is scheduled to go to India at the end of September. The Chiang clique plans to establish a so-called "India-China Friendship Association" in India. On September 6th, 70 Indian reactionary parliamentarians issued a joint statement, shouting to "sever diplomatic relations" with China and to "establish diplomatic relations" with the Chiang clique.

The Indian reactionary and traitorous government has already exposed itself as completely acting under the orders of U.S. imperialism in its anti-China stance and in creating "two Chinas." During a previous period, it pretended not to change its original policy towards China in order to deceive the Indian people and the people of the world. Now, Desai is eager to beg his American master, and even this mask has been thrown away. The Indian reactionary government is going further and further in its anti-China stance and will absolutely not escape the punishment of the Indian people and the people of the world!

　　印度反动派撕掉假面具公开同蒋帮勾搭制造“两个中国”
　　死心塌地追随美帝反华必将自食恶果
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：印度极端反动卖国的英迪拉·甘地政府最近公然表示追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”。这样，印度反动政府就公开参加了美帝国主义的一些走狗（如日本佐藤政府）制造“两个中国”的行列。这是印度反动派加紧反华的一个新的严重步骤。
    印度反动政府副总理德赛，十二日在华盛顿举行记者招待会，有记者问他：印度政府是否会支持“两个中国”在联合国之内？他回答说：“为什么不行？现在有两块领土。福摩萨（美帝国主义和各国反动派对台湾的称呼）既然已经是联合国的一个会员国，它今天已经是一个独立国。”
    德赛的这次谈话，公然抛弃了印度历届政府声称的只承认一个中国，不承认台湾蒋介石匪帮的立场，公然参与印度反动派的主子美帝国主义在联合国内制造“两个中国”的反华阴谋行动。
    据印度报纸报道，九月十六日，印度总理英迪拉·甘地同国大党议员们交谈时，有一些议员指出，德赛十二日的谈话是否背离印度政府已经宣布的政策。英迪拉·甘地说：德赛在记者招待会中和声明中所说的，正确地代表了政府的政策。
    九月十五日，印度政府发言人尽管还在假惺惺地表示，印度政府只承认中华人民共和国的政策不变，但是当新闻记者问他，印度政府是否继续认为台湾是中国的一部分。这个发言人竟然拒不发表意见。印度反动报纸也为德赛制造“两个中国”发出一阵喝采声，叫嚣说“这是向现实主义迈进的值得欢迎的一步”，“这样讲是合乎常情的事情”等等。
    德赛在美国发表“两个中国”的言论，是印度反动政府既定的反华政策的必然暴露。最近几年来，印度反动政府按照美国主子的意旨，同台湾蒋介石匪帮愈来愈频繁和露骨地勾搭。蒋匪帮的反动官僚和印度执政党和其它反动政党的人员往返奔忙于台湾与新德里之间。由印度国大党和其他一些反动政党头子组成的一个代表团，最近到台湾参加极端反动的所谓“世界反共联盟第一届大会”。蒋匪帮的所谓“中印缅文化经济促进会”的代表团，定于九月底去印度活动。蒋匪帮计划在印度成立一个所谓“印中友协”。九月六日，印度七十名反动议员发表联合声明，叫嚣要同中国“断交”，同蒋帮“建交”。
    印度反动卖国政府在反华和制造“两个中国”问题上，已经暴露出它完全是按照美帝国主义的指挥行事的。过去一段期间，它装出不改变固有的对华政策的样子，以便欺骗印度人民和世界人民。现在，德赛急于向美国主子求乞，连这一块假面具也索性扔掉了。印度反动政府在反华问题上愈走愈远，是绝对逃脱不了印度人民和世界人民对它的惩罚的！
