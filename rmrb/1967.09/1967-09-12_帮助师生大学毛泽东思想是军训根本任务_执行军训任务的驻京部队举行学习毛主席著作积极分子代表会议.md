In Beijing, over 300 schools, from primary to tertiary, have been assigned military training tasks by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the capital. From September 5th to 9th, these units held a conference for representatives of active learners and propagandists of Chairman Mao's works. The conference demonstrated that the PLA units in Beijing, while carrying out military and political training tasks, have been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction, promoting revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," advancing the revolutionary criticism movement, and making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

More than 300 representatives of active learners and propagandists of Chairman Mao's works, as well as representatives of advanced units, participated in this conference. Among them were representatives from military training teams in Beijing Normal University, the 23rd Middle School, Shijingshan Middle School, the 89th Middle School, Baijiazhuang Middle School, the 91st Middle School, and other primary and secondary schools, who resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary faction, achieved revolutionary unity, resumed classes and made revolution, and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism. There were also representatives from the military training team of the 7th Girls' Middle School, who actively helped cadres stand up in revolution, boldly used revolutionary cadres, and achieved certain results. Additionally, there were representatives from the military training team of the 64th Middle School, who resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, sincerely and openly admitted their mistakes to the masses, immediately corrected them, and made new contributions. There were also representatives from the military training team of Renmin University Affiliated Middle School, who correctly resolved contradictions among revolutionary mass organizations, achieved revolutionary unity, and promoted revolutionary criticism. Furthermore, there were representatives like Deputy Political Instructor Ou Qingwei from the military training team of the 89th Middle School, who were originally active learners of Chairman Mao's works and, during military training, wholeheartedly served as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, making new contributions.

At the conference, the representatives fully exchanged their advanced experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They reported on the achievements made in the past half year while carrying out military training tasks.

In the past half year, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers participating in military training have always regarded helping revolutionary teachers and students to study and establish Mao Zedong Thought as a fundamental task. They have used their model actions to pass on the precious experience of the PLA in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the broad revolutionary teachers and students, promoting the thought revolutionization of revolutionary teachers and students, and enhancing their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. Now, in many schools, with the help of the PLA, a system has been established to read Chairman Mao's books and study Chairman Mao's quotations every day. Many revolutionary youngsters, under the guidance of the soldiers and officers, have developed a deep class sentiment for Chairman Mao's works, reading them at any time and place, and skillfully using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to solve various practical problems in the Cultural Revolution. They excitedly said: Since the military and political training began, we have gradually tasted the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works. We must, like the PLA, study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and become good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Under the help of the PLA, many schools have carried out deeper and broader revolutionary criticism and rectification within their units. The broad revolutionary teachers and students are now using their utmost effort and wisdom to criticize and repudiate, in both speech and writing, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Through the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and the "three-in-one combination" have made significant progress. Currently, nearly half of the primary and secondary schools in the city that are undergoing military and political training have achieved revolutionary unity. Among them, 107 schools have established temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination," and more than 150 schools have resumed classes and made revolution.

While summarizing and exchanging experiences, the representatives seriously studied Comrade Lin Biao's great call to "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They decided, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to launch a larger-scale revolutionary criticism movement, and to guide the revolutionary teachers and students to develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," making new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    帮助师生大学毛泽东思想是军训根本任务
    执行军训任务的驻京部队举行学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议
    据新华社十日讯　在北京三百多所大中学校执行军政训练任务的人民解放军驻京部队，从五日到九日举行了学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。会议表明：驻京部队在执行军政训练任务中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，支持无产阶级革命派，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，推动了革命大批判，为无产阶级文化大革命立了新功。
    参加这次会议的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子和先进单位代表共三百多人。其中有坚决支持无产阶级革命派，实现革命大联合，复课闹革命，深入开展革命大批判的北京师范大学、二十三中、石景山中学、八十九中、白家庄中学、九十一中等大中学校军训团的代表；有积极帮助干部站出来革命，大胆使用革命干部，取得了一定成绩的女七中等军训团的代表；有坚决贯彻毛主席指示，认真诚恳地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正，立了新功的六十四中军训团的代表；有正确解决革命群众组织之间的矛盾，实现革命大联合，促进革命大批判的人民大学附属中学军训团的代表。还有原来就是学习毛主席著作积极分子，在军训中全心全意当毛泽东思想的宣传员，立了新功的八十九中军训团副指导员欧庆伟等。
    会上，代表们充分交流了在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验，汇报了半年来在执行军训任务中取得的成绩。
    半年来，参加军训的广大指战员，始终把帮助革命师生大学、大立毛泽东思想，当成军训的一项根本任务。他们以自己的模范行动，把人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的宝贵经验，传给广大革命师生，促进革命师生思想革命化，提高革命师生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。现在，许多学校，在解放军的帮助下，建立起天天读毛主席的书、会会学毛主席语录的制度。许多革命小将在指战员们的启发诱导下，对毛主席著作有了深厚的阶级感情，随时随地读毛主席的书，并善于用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，解决文化大革命中的各种现实问题。他们激动地说：军政训练以来，我们渐渐尝到了学习毛主席著作的甜头。我们一定要象解放军那样，一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    许多学校在解放军的帮助下，革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，开展得越来越深入、越来越广泛。广大革命师生正以最大的精力，最大的智慧，口诛笔伐，深揭猛批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。通过革命的大批判，革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”有了很大发展。目前，全市进行军政训练的大中学校已有近半数实现了革命的大联合。其中有一百零七所学校建立起“三结合”的临时权力机构，有一百五十多所学校已经复课闹革命。
    在总结和交流经验的同时，代表们认真学习了林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召，他们决心和革命师生一起，活学活用毛主席著作，掀起更大规模的革命大批判高潮，并引导革命师生发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，在无产阶级文化大革命中再立新功。
