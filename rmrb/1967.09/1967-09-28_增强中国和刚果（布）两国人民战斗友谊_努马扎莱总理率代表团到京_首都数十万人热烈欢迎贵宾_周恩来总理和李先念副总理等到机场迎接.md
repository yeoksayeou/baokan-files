Tens of Thousands of Capital Residents Warmly Welcome the Guests
Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Others Welcome at the Airport

New China News Agency, September 27th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement of the People's Republic of the Congo, Prime Minister, and Head of Government, Ambroise Noumazalaye, and the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo led by him, arrived in Beijing by special plane from Shanghai this afternoon. They were warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of revolutionary masses of the capital in a grand and enthusiastic procession.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Zhou Jianren, and others went to the airport to warmly welcome the Congolese guests.

The delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo, led by Prime Minister Noumazalaye, came to China at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, during the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, for a friendly visit. Accompanying Prime Minister Noumazalaye on his visit to China are Gabriel Bouka, Felix Taty-Gustave, and Minister of the Interior and Posts and Telecommunications Andre Ombesa, members of the Central Committee of the National Revolutionary Movement of the People's Republic of the Congo. The visit of the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo will further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and the People's Republic of the Congo established in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

At 3:30 PM, Prime Minister Noumazalaye and other Congolese friends stepped off the plane to a roar of cheers. Premier Zhou Enlai stepped forward to express his warm welcome. A group of Red Guards presented the revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Prime Minister Noumazalaye and other Congolese friends and read the teachings of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the peoples of the world: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world must dare to fight, must not be afraid of difficulties, must go forward unyieldingly, and then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All monsters will be annihilated."

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of the Congo and China. Prime Minister Noumazalaye, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, inspected the three-service honor guard and the honor guard of the militia and Red Guards, and circled the field to meet with the welcoming crowd. Red Guard representatives from the capital ran out of the welcoming line to pin shining Mao badges on the Congolese friends. The people gathered at the airport waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and the People's Republic of the Congo!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" Prime Minister Noumazalaye and other Congolese friends also waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and greeted the welcoming crowd.

Today, the city of Beijing was filled with the joy of welcoming distinguished guests. Along the more than twenty-li stretch from Dongcheng District's Jian Guo Men to the western suburbs' welcoming hotel, red flags fluttered in the wind like a forest. On the sides of the streets, tall buildings had huge banners hanging across them reading, "Warmly welcome the friends from the People's Republic of the Congo!" "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese people!" The welcoming revolutionary masses held high the portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the peoples of the world, the portrait of President Massamba-Debat of the People's Republic of the Congo, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" signs, and the national flags of China and the People's Republic of the Congo, lining the streets on both sides, beating drums and gongs, singing revolutionary songs, and reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When Prime Minister Noumazalaye, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, passed through the city in an open-top car, the welcoming crowd immediately became excited, and the streets were filled with singing and applause. People repeatedly shouted, "Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the Congolese people!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" Prime Minister Noumazalaye frequently waved and greeted the welcoming crowd. When Prime Minister Noumazalaye's car arrived at Tiananmen Square, a troupe of thousands of Red Guards performed lively dances to the music of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" such as "We Are the Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao," "Great Unity of the Nationalities," and "Female Militia," expressing the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Congolese people.

After the Congolese friends' car passed through Tiananmen Square, it began to rain. Although the welcoming crowd's clothes were soaked by the rain, they continued to sing and dance, shouting welcoming slogans until the Congolese friends entered the hotel.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the guests today also included leaders from various government departments, leaders from various sectors of the People's Liberation Army, and leaders from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin and Congolese Ambassador Bazanga, who went to Shanghai to welcome the guests, accompanied Prime Minister Noumazalaye to Beijing.

Diplomats from various countries in China also went to the airport to welcome the guests.

This morning, the delegation of the National Revolutionary Movement and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo, led by Prime Minister Noumazalaye, visited the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai. When they left Shanghai, leaders from various sectors of Shanghai went to the airport to see them off. (Accompanying photo)
