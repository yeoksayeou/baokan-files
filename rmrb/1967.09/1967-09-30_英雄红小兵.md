	Red Little Soldier Heroes

	In the great Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Wàng Xīn People's Commune Central School in Jiading County, Shanghai, exposed a class enemy who had infiltrated the teaching staff. This villain had once held reactionary positions such as a Kuomintang pseudo-militia, pseudo-village head, pseudo-town head, and pseudo-lieutenant liaison officer, committing heinous crimes against the people. Since liberation, he has spread reactionary remarks everywhere and taken revenge on the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, making him a vile old counter-revolutionary.

	After the revolutionary masses exposed this villain, they put him under supervised labor. However, this cunning rascal would work a bit when someone was watching but slack off when no one was around. He harbored deep hatred towards the Red Little Soldiers supervising his labor and was always plotting to take revenge.

	One day, this scoundrel pretended to be sick and stayed home. The Red Little Soldiers went to call him out to work. This old villain, driven by his evil nature, not only refused to come out but also poured boiling water out the door, scalding the necks and chests of several Red Little Soldiers, and threw bricks at them.

	The Red Little Soldiers, armed with the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong, would not let this villain go. They decided to climb in through the ventilation window and drag this villain out for struggle. The son of a poor peasant, Mao Wenyuan, rushed forward and was the first to crawl through the ventilation window, quickly opening the door. A group of Red Little Soldiers, filled with righteous indignation, rushed into the house and surrounded this villain, struggling with him until he was speechless.

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." This cunning counter-revolutionary was making his final struggle. Taking advantage of the Red Little Soldiers' lack of vigilance, he suddenly pulled out a sharp axe and swung it wildly at the Red Little Soldiers. He first aimed at Gui Jinming but missed. He missed the second and third times as well. Finally, he grabbed the small-statured Jin Huajian, ready to chop down on his head. Just at this critical moment, Mao Wenyuan, standing behind Jin Huajian, bravely threw himself forward. With hands like iron clamps, he tightly grabbed the axe in the enemy's hand and pulled it down with all his might. His fingers were cut, but he paid no heed. Several other Red Little Soldiers then fiercely beat the old villain's hand, forcing the enemy to let go. Jin Huajian thus escaped from the jaws of death.

	This old villain's evil heart did not die. He turned around and swung the axe at Mao Wenyuan from the side. Mao Wenyuan could not dodge in time, and the sharp axe cut into his waist, blood gushing out. At this moment, the heroic image of Liu Wenxue appeared before Mao Wenyuan's eyes. He endured the pain, gritted his teeth, and used his foot to trip the enemy's foot. With all his strength, he thrust the axe handle towards the enemy's chest. The old villain stumbled backward and fell flat on his back. Mao Wenyuan seized the opportunity, straddling him with both legs and pinning him down. The old villain still struggled, but the revolutionary teachers and students, hearing the news, rushed over and finally captured this counter-revolutionary.

	The brave Red Little Soldier Mao Wenyuan was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. His blood soaked through his clothes, but he did not utter a single cry. When his parents came to see him, he still comforted them, saying, "I want to learn from Liu Wenxue. This little injury is nothing."

	After this class struggle, Mao Wenyuan became even stronger. While recuperating, he never let go of the Little Red Book, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle." As soon as his injury healed, he organized the Red Little Soldiers in the production team and formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squad. During their spare time, they performed everywhere, actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

	Mao Wenyuan's heroic deeds quickly spread. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously praised him, saying, "He is truly a Red Little Soldier of Chairman Mao!"

　　英雄红小兵
    上海嘉定县望新公社中心小学的革命师生，在伟大的文化大革命中，把一个混在教师队伍里的牛鬼蛇神揪了出来。这个坏蛋，曾经任过国民党伪宪兵、伪乡长、伪镇长、伪少校联络员等反动职务，对人民犯下了滔天罪行。解放以来，他到处散布反动言论，对贫下中农子女进行阶级报复，是一个罪大恶极的老反革命分子。
    革命群众把这个坏蛋揪出来以后，对他实行监督劳动。但是，这个狡猾的家伙，有人在跟前就干两下，没人在旁边就磨洋工，并且对于监督他劳动的红小兵，十分仇恨，处心积虑地伺机进行阶级报复。
    有一天，这个家伙装病躲在家里，红小兵们就去叫他出来劳动。这老坏蛋贼性发作，非但不出来，反而往外泼开水，把几个红小兵的脖子、胸脯都烫红了，还拿砖块往外砸。
    用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的红小兵，那里能放掉这个坏家伙。他们决定从气窗口爬进去，把这个坏蛋拖出来斗争。贫农的儿子毛文元抢上前去，头一个钻进气窗口，很快地把门打开了。一群满腔怒火的红小兵涌进了屋，围住这个坏家伙，进行斗争，把他斗得哑口无言。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”这个阴险的反革命分子，就是要作垂死的挣扎。他趁红小兵们没有防备，突然抽出一把锋利的斧子，没头没脑地向红小兵们砍来。他第一个想砍归金明，没有砍中，第二个第三个也没有砍中。最后，他抓住了个子矮小的金华健，正想劈头砍下去，就在这千钧一发之际，站在金华健身后的毛文元，奋不顾身地扑了上去，两手象铁钳一样，把敌人手里的斧子紧紧钳住，拚命往下拉。手指头被割破了，也顾不得。另外几个红小兵就狠命地打老坏蛋的手，迫使敌人松了手，金华健才脱离了虎口。
    这个老坏蛋贼心不死，扭过身来，一斧子从毛文元侧面砍来，毛文元躲闪不及，锋利的斧头砍进他的腰部，鲜血直流。这时候，刘文学的英雄形象出现在毛文元眼前。他强忍着疼痛，咬紧牙关，用脚把敌人的脚绊住，使尽全身力气，用斧子柄对准敌人的胸口，猛力顶过去。老坏蛋往后一退，一个踉跄，跌了个四脚朝天。毛文元趁势两腿一跨，把他压住了。老坏蛋还想挣扎，革命师生闻讯赶来，终于把这个反革命分子逮住了。
    英勇的红小兵毛文元被送进医院急救。鲜血浸透了衣裤，他也没有叫喊一声。当他的父母去看他时，他还安慰父母亲说：“我要向刘文学学习。这点伤算得了什么。”
    经过这一场阶级斗争风浪的考验，毛文元比以前更坚强了。养伤的时候，他红色宝书不离手，反复学习毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。伤刚刚养好，就把生产队里的红小兵组织起来，成立了一个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，利用空隙时间，到处演出，积极宣传毛泽东思想。
    毛文元的英勇事迹很快就传开了。贫下中农一致赞扬他说，真不愧是毛主席的红小兵！
