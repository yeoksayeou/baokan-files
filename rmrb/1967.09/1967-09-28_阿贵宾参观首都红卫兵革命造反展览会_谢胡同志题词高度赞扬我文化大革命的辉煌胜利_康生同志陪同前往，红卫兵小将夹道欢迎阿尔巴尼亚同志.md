Albanian Guests Visit the Capital Red Guards Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition

Hoxha Comrade Highly Praises the Splendid Victory of Our Cultural Revolution

Kang Sheng Comrade Accompanies the Visit, Red Guards Welcome Albanian Comrades

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, September 27th – Comrade Hoxha, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, and the entire delegation of Albanian Party and Government officials led by him, today visited the Capital Red Guards Revolutionary Rebellion Exhibition at the Beijing Exhibition Hall, accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Hoxha and his delegation showed great interest and carefully inspected all the exhibits, and wrote an inscription for the exhibition.

	In his inscription, Comrade Hoxha wrote, "The exhibition clearly reflects the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the great leader of the 700 million Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and reflects the extremely significant victories achieved by this revolution. These victories are the victories of the Mao Zedong thought line over the traitorous, revisionist, and bourgeois black line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his clique."

	Comrade Hoxha's inscription further states, "The exhibition fully demonstrates the role played by the Red Guards in the past and present of the Cultural Revolution, their bravery and firmness, their loyalty to the revolutionary cause and communism, and to the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong."

	Comrade Hoxha wrote in his inscription, "The Albanian people and their Party of Labor congratulate the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat in the past and present. These victories further consolidate the People's Republic of China and further consolidate the position of Marxism-Leninism and socialism in China."

	The inscription continues, "The People's China led by Comrade Mao Zedong will forever be red and revolutionary, and will forever be the bastion and loyal standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism and the world revolution. Let all traitors, the Chinese Khrushchev and his handful of followers, all reactionaries, American imperialists, and Khrushchev revisionists tremble at the failures they have suffered and the miserable and shameful fate that awaits them!" The inscription points out, "The Chinese people, the Red Guards, and all Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Albanian people and Albanian youth, under the leadership of the Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, will forever hold high the pure banner of Marxism-Leninism, will forever stand together, and march forward shoulder to shoulder. The close, unbreakable, and fraternal Marxist-Leninist friendship binds us together. We will forever march forward victoriously on the revolutionary, socialist, and communist path, and in the struggle against imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, these enemies."

	This noon, when Comrade Hoxha led the Albanian Party and Government delegation to the Beijing Exhibition Hall, the Red Guards welcomed the heroic Albanian comrades from the Adriatic coast with great joy. The Albanian comrades led the chant, "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" The Red Guards followed with, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" They then sang songs like "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Beijing-Tirana." The Albanian comrades and the Red Guards warmly shook hands and embraced each other.

	When they reached the giant portrait of Chairman Mao in the exhibition hall, Comrade Hoxha was very pleased and proposed to take a photo with Chairman Mao's Red Guards. Accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng, the Albanian comrades and Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards took a photo together. At this moment, the Red Guards enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Salute to the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live the fighting friendship and revolutionary unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!" The revolutionary youths presented red-armed Red Guards armbands to the Albanian comrades and pinned bright red Chairman Mao badges on the chests of the Albanian comrades. The Albanian Party and Government delegation presented a banner embroidered with the national emblem of the People's Republic of Albania and inscribed with "Long live the eternal friendship between Albania and China" to the exhibition.

	When Comrade Hoxha led the Albanian Party and Government delegation to leave the exhibition hall, the Red Guards rushed to the door, waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting, "Mao Zedong—Enver" "Enver—Mao Zedong."

　　阿贵宾参观首都红卫兵革命造反展览会
　　谢胡同志题词高度赞扬我文化大革命的辉煌胜利
　　康生同志陪同前往，红卫兵小将夹道欢迎阿尔巴尼亚同志
    新华社二十七日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡同志和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，今天由中共中央政治局常委康生同志陪同，前往北京展览馆参观首都红卫兵革命造反展览会。谢胡等同志以极大兴趣详细地参观了全部展品，并给展览会题了词。
    谢胡同志在题词中写道，“展览会清楚地反映了由七亿中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，反映了这一革命所取得的极其重大的胜利。这些胜利是毛泽东的马克思列宁主义路线战胜中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙的叛徒的、修正主义的、资产阶级的黑线的胜利。”题词中说，“展览会充分地说明了红卫兵在文化大革命中过去和现在所起的作用，说明了他们的勇敢和坚定，对革命和共产主义事业、对毛泽东同志的思想的忠诚。”
    谢胡同志在题词中说，“阿尔巴尼亚人民及其劳动党祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命过去和现在所取得的伟大胜利。这些胜利更加巩固了中华人民共和国，更加巩固了马克思列宁主义和社会主义在中国的阵地。”
    题词继续写道，“毛泽东同志领导的人民中国将永远是红色的，革命的，将永远是马克思列宁主义和世界革命的堡垒和忠实的旗手。让所有的叛徒、中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一小撮追随者、所有的反动派、美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为他们所遭到的失败、为等待着他们的悲惨的可耻下场发抖去吧！”题词中指出，“中国人民、红卫兵和全体中国青年，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚青年，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，将永远高举纯洁的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，将永远团结在一起，并肩前进。紧密的、牢不可破的、兄弟般的马克思列宁主义的友谊把我们联结在一起。我们在革命的、社会主义的和共产主义的道路上，在同帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派这些敌人的斗争中，将永远胜利地前进。”
    今天中午，当谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团来到北京展览馆时，红卫兵小将们怀着万分高兴的心情，夹道热烈欢迎来自亚得里亚海边的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友们。阿尔巴尼亚同志带头高呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！”红卫兵小将们接着高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”随后高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《北京—地拉那》等歌曲。阿尔巴尼亚同志和红卫兵小将们亲切握手，热烈拥抱。
    当参观到展览馆大厅内的一幅巨大的毛主席彩色画像时，谢胡同志非常高兴，提议要和毛主席的红卫兵一起拍照。由康生同志陪同，阿尔巴尼亚同志和毛主席的红小兵一起照了相。这时，红卫兵小将们激动地欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！”“中阿两党、两国、两国人民之间的战斗友谊和革命团结万岁！”革命小将们把红底金字红卫兵袖章献给阿尔巴尼亚战友，把红光闪闪的毛主席像章佩戴在阿尔巴尼亚同志们胸前。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团把一面绣有阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国徽、写着“阿中永恒的友谊万岁”的锦旗献给展览会。
    当谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团离开展览馆时，红卫兵小将拥往门前，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”。
