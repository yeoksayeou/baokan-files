The General Departments of the PLA, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the Revolutionary Masses of the Three Services in Beijing Celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising Led by the Great Leader Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on armed seizure of power is a genius development of Marxism-Leninism. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have launched a great struggle and criticism against China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing for their long-standing opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and their frenzied promotion of the bourgeois military line. They are determined to remain forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, to defend our proletarian dictatorship, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to contribute everything to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

New China News Agency, September 7th: In the midst of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the General Departments of the PLA, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the leadership organs of the Three Services in Beijing have held various activities in recent days to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by the great leader Chairman Mao. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers enthusiastically acclaim the arrival of a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, and fervently praise the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and great practices on armed seizure of power, people's war, and people's army, which are a genius development of Marxism-Leninism and have pointed out the only correct road to victory for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to remain forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to forever march forward on the brilliant road opened by Chairman Mao, to defend our proletarian dictatorship, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to contribute everything to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Over the past two days, the General Departments of the PLA, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the leadership organs of the Three Services in Beijing have been filled with a festive atmosphere. The General Logistics Department, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the Navy, the Air Force, the Second Artillery, the Signal Corps, the Engineering Corps, the Armored Corps, and the Beijing Garrison Command have all held grand commemorative meetings or symposiums. Many units have also organized cadres and soldiers to review Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?", "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," and "The Spark Will Kindle a Prairie Fire," and held symposiums. Various units have also set up special columns, written big-character posters, held photo exhibitions, and performed artistic programs to enthusiastically sing the praises of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao and the great march to Jinggangshan. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have severely criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing for their frenzied opposition to Chairman Mao's great military thoughts. The Joint Performance Committee of the Three Services' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Troupe has also held grand performances on Tiananmen Square in recent days to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers and civilians.

At the commemorative meetings and symposiums held in various units, many revolutionary leaders who have experienced countless battles and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers with revolutionary vigor pointed out with great emotion that the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao 40 years ago has great historical and world significance and will forever shine with boundless brilliance. They unanimously agreed that the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao and the great march to Jinggangshan not only opened the only correct road to victory for the Chinese people but also pointed out the broad and smooth road to true liberation for the proletariat and oppressed peoples of the whole world. They excitedly said that today, Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has been accepted by more and more revolutionary peoples in countries and regions around the world. They have taken up the gun and embarked on the road of armed struggle. It can be said that under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary flame of the Autumn Harvest Uprising will surely spread throughout the globe, creating a bright red new world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power, solving problems through war. 'Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people.' The revolutionary masses of the PLA's leadership organs in Beijing, while celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, have repeatedly studied these teachings of Chairman Mao. They have launched a massive struggle and criticism against China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing for their long-standing opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and their frenzied promotion of the bourgeois military line. At the commemorative meeting of the Beijing Garrison Command for the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, an old Red Army soldier said, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought have been developed in the midst of fierce struggles against various opportunistic thoughts. It is our lifeline. China's Khrushchev wants to change the color of our army, but we will not agree. The revolutionary masses of the leadership organs of the Navy and Air Force angrily pointed out at the meeting that China's Khrushchev has long opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and promoted the revisionist line. His agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have vigorously promoted the bourgeois military line, opposed emphasizing politics, and pushed for military technology first, attempting to turn our army into a bourgeois army and achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose them! The revolutionary masses of the direct organs of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, after reviewing the situation of the two-line struggle on the national defense science and technology front, solemnly declared to Chairman Mao: We will raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly purge all the poison left by China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing on the national defense science and technology front, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must turn the national defense science and technology front into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

In the extensive commemorative activities, the officers and soldiers have seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks," and have decided to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, to highhold the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," and to more firmly unite with the revolutionary masses, fight with them, and win with them. Many officers and soldiers on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" are currently putting into practice their love for what the revolutionary masses love, their urgency for what the revolutionary masses are urgent about, and their help for what the revolutionary masses need, as a practical action to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Autumn Harvest Uprising. The revolutionary artists of the Three Services' revolutionary masses' art troupe who are propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses of the capital have expressed their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call to "highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement," to stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the broad revolutionary masses of the capital, to fight together, and to win new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On August 21st, the combat personnel of a certain unit of the Air Force who shot down two U.S. planes in one go held a symposium, enthusiastically praising the road opened by Chairman Mao himself in the Autumn Harvest Uprising as the only correct road for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    新华社七日讯　在我国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，中国人民解放军各总部、国防科委和陆海空三军驻京领导机关无产阶级革命派，连日展开各种活动，欢庆伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义四十周年。广大指战员热烈欢呼世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席关于武装夺取政权，关于人民战争、人民军队的光辉思想和伟大实践，是对马克思列宁主义的天才发展，为中国革命和世界革命指出了唯一正确的胜利道路。大家一致表示，永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，永远沿着毛主席开辟的光辉道路战斗前进，为保卫我国无产阶级专政，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，支援世界人民的革命斗争贡献自己的一切。
    这两天，在解放军各总部、国防科委和陆海空三军驻京领导机关里，到处洋溢着欢乐的节日气氛。总后勤部、国防科委、海军、空军、第二炮兵、通讯兵、工程兵、装甲兵领导机关以及北京卫戍区部队，都分别举行了隆重的纪念大会或座谈会。许多单位还分别组织干部、战士重温了毛主席《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》《井冈山的斗争》和《星星之火，可以燎原》等光辉著作，进行了座谈。各单位还出专栏，写大字报，举办图片展览，排演文艺节目，热情歌颂毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义和向井冈山的伟大进军。广大指战员狠狠批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿疯狂反对毛主席伟大军事思想的滔天罪行。三军联合演出委员会的毛泽东思想宣传队，还连日在天安门广场举行了纪念秋收起义四十周年的盛大演出，受到广大军民的热烈欢迎。
    在各单位举行的纪念大会和座谈会上，许多身经百战的革命领导干部和革命朝气蓬勃的广大指战员以无比激动的心情指出，四十年前，毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义具有划时代的伟大历史意义和世界意义，将永远放射出无限灿烂的光辉。他们一致认为，毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义和向井冈山的伟大进军，不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国胜利的唯一正确道路，而且为全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民指出了争取真正解放的康庄大道。他们兴奋地说，今天，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，已被越来越多的国家和地区的革命人民所接受。他们拿起枪杆子，走上了武装斗争的道路。可以断言，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，秋收起义的革命烈火，必将燃遍全球，打出一个红彤彤的新世界。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”解放军驻京机关无产阶级革命派在欢庆秋收起义四十周年的日子里，反复学习了毛主席的这些教导。他们对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线的滔天罪行，展开了声势浩大的大批判，大斗争。在北京卫戍区举行的纪念秋收起义四十周年大会上，一位老红军战士说，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想是在同各种机会主义思想的激烈斗争中发展起来的。它是我们的命根子。中国的赫鲁晓夫妄想改变我军的颜色，我们坚决不答应。海军、空军领导机关无产阶级革命派在大会上愤怒地指出，中国的赫鲁晓夫几十年来一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行修正主义路线。他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿，大肆推行资产阶级军事路线，反对突出政治，大搞军事技术第一，妄图把我军演变为资产阶级军队，实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们一定要把他们彻底批倒批臭！国防科委直属机关无产阶级革命派，回顾了国防科研战线上两条路线斗争的情况后，向毛主席庄严宣誓：我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿在国防科研战线上的一切流毒，树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威，一定要把国防科研战线办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    在广泛开展的纪念活动中，指战员们认真学习了毛主席关于“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”的教导，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，更加坚定地和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。许多在“三支”“两军”第一线上的指战员，当前都把爱革命派之所爱，急革命派之所急，帮革命派之所需，作为纪念秋收起义四十周年的实际行动。在向首都革命群众宣传毛泽东思想的三军无产阶级革命派文艺战士表示，坚决响应林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大号召，和首都广大革命群众肩并肩，心贴心，共同战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。（附图片）
