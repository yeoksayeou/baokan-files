Liberation armed forces in various parts of South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of people's war, employing flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to roam freely and fight bravely, striking deep into enemy strongholds and achieving great victories.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province, from July 25 to August 30, continuously attacked the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing over 3,000 enemy personnel, including more than 2,200 American invaders. They also captured three enemy strongholds, destroyed 13 "strategic hamlets," shot down 38 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or captured numerous military vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and supplies. In the northern region of this province, the guerrillas, through extensive minefields, killed over 200 enemy soldiers and destroyed or damaged eight enemy vehicles in just 20 days from August 9 to 29.

On the night of August 28, the liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province simultaneously attacked enemy forces stationed in the Tuy An area and several "strategic hamlets" in the Vung Mountain area, annihilating 110 enemy soldiers and "pacification officers." On the night of August 30, the liberation armed forces also shelled enemy military bases and "strategic hamlets" in Vung Mountain, Thua Thien, and Tuy Hoa counties, causing heavy casualties and losses to the enemy.

In August, the guerrillas and local forces in Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, and My Tho provinces successively infiltrated many towns and "strategic hamlets" under enemy control, conducting armed propaganda and punishing traitors, striking fear into the enemy.

On the night of August 5, the brave and cunning guerrillas and local forces in Phu Yen Province successfully infiltrated Vu Thuat Town, quickly capturing a group of stubborn puppets, issuing warnings, and rallying the people to propagate the victories of the liberation armed forces. They controlled the town for five hours before safely withdrawing.

On the nights of August 24 and 25, the guerrillas in Chau Thanh County, Binh Dinh Province, repeatedly entered Thanh Dien and Long Thanh communes, blowing up enemy bunkers, annihilating many enemy soldiers, and distributing thousands of leaflets.

On the nights of August 11 and 19, the guerrillas in My Tho Province infiltrated two "strategic hamlets" along the Fourth Highway, helping local people destroy enemy administrative structures and punishing traitors.

To paralyze enemy transportation lines, in the latter half of August, the military and people of the Central Highlands blew up nearly 20 bridges on the highway from Hue to Bien Hoa, guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps and South Korean mercenaries. The First Highway from Nguyen Duc to Da Nang, from Nui Thanh to Tam Ky, from Phu My to Deo, and from Quang Ngai to Tra Bong has been cut off by the liberation armed forces.

At the end of August and the beginning of September, the military and people of My Tho Province continued to sabotage the Fourth Highway, destroying 21 points on the section from Xa Mat to Xa Giai alone, and setting up numerous obstacles on the road, making it impossible for enemy vehicles to pass. During this period, the guerrillas in My Tho Province continuously ambushed the Fourth Highway, destroying 16 enemy vehicles, demolishing two bunkers, and annihilating many enemy soldiers, capturing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

On the night of August 28, the guerrillas in Phu My County, Can Tho Province, blew up a nearly 100-meter-long bridge on the Fourth Highway near Phu My Town, making the road from Can Tho to Soc Trang impassable for several days.

In the An Xuyen-Dong Thap region, the guerrillas of Ben Tre and Cho Moi counties fought bravely from August 17 to 22, thwarting a large-scale "sweep" by 5,000 U.S. and puppet troops, killing nearly 100 enemy soldiers, shooting down three helicopters, and capturing a batch of weapons.
