	Indian Progressive Weekly "Recalling the Patriot" Severely Condemns Soviet Revisionist Anti-China Crimes
	Soviet Revisionists Collaborate with U.S. Imperialists to Sabotage the World Revolution
	Pakistani Newspaper Condemns U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists for Inciting Indian Reactionaries to Provoke China

	New Delhi, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) - The Punjabi-language progressive weekly "Recalling the Patriot" recently published an article severely condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialists to oppose China and sabotage the world revolution. The article enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese Communist Party as the vanguard of the international communist movement and the struggle against revisionism.

	The article states: "The Soviet leadership and the Soviet government have deviated from Marxism-Leninism, abandoned the revolutionary path, and focused on promoting non-revolutionary parliamentary struggle, thus exposing themselves as a leadership group keen on revisionist ideology and practice."

	The article says that at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist leadership conspired to make the international communist movement deviate from the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary path. At the 22nd and 23rd Congresses of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist leadership further slid down the revisionist path and attempted to silence, intimidate, split, and suppress those in the international communist movement who resisted their revisionist line.

	The article enthusiastically praises the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. It points out: "Today, the vanguard against modern revisionism in the international communist movement is the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is the largest communist party in the world. Under its leadership, the largest country in the world, China, is following the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary path and completing the tasks that the October Revolution in the Soviet Union did not complete."

	"The Chinese today are the leaders of the international communist revolutionary movement and active supporters of all anti-imperialist struggles. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, China stands at the forefront of the struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership. In this struggle, China not only gains the support of the growing anti-revisionist forces in the international communist movement but also their trust."

	The article says that the Chinese Communist Party's struggle against revisionism has sounded the death knell for the Soviet revisionist leadership. Therefore, the Soviet revisionists are doing everything they can to make China succumb to revisionism and are fully supporting U.S. imperialism's opposition to China. Today, both the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are vigorously conducting dirty anti-China propaganda, attempting to isolate and overthrow China. Therefore, it is clear that the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are completely colluding with each other.

	The article says that U.S. imperialism is directing some countries' reactionaries to encircle China, but history has loudly refuted these conspirators who devised the encirclement policy. Future history will once again severely strike the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries who conspire to encircle China.

	According to Xinhua, Rawalpindi, Sept. 14 - The Pakistani newspaper "Construction Daily" published an article stating that the recent armed invasion by the Indian government on the China-Sikkim border is part of the U.S. imperialists' and Soviet revisionists' conspiracy to militarily encircle and provoke China.

	The article says that when the U.S. government provides various aids to the Indian government to carry out anti-China activities, the Soviet government also colludes with the Indian reactionary government, executing the same anti-China policy as U.S. imperialism.

　　印度进步周刊《回忆爱国者报》严厉谴责苏修反华罪行
　　苏修同美帝狼狈为奸破坏世界革命
　　巴基斯坦报纸谴责美帝苏修唆使印度反动派向中国挑衅
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度旁遮普文进步周刊《回忆爱国者报》最近发表文章，严厉谴责苏共修正主义领导集团勾结美帝共同反华，破坏世界革命。它热情歌颂毛主席领导的中国共产党是国际共产主义运动和反修斗争的先锋。
    文章说：“苏共领导和苏联政府背离马克思列宁主义，抛弃了革命道路，集中力量宣扬非革命的议会斗争形式，从而暴露了它是热中于修正主义思想和实践的领导集团。”
    文章说，在苏共第二十次代表大会上，苏联修正主义领导就阴谋使国际共产主义运动背离马克思列宁主义的革命道路。苏修领导在苏共第二十二次代表大会和第二十三次代表大会上沿着修正主义道路进一步滑了下去，并且力图封住国际共产主义运动中抵制它们的修正主义路线的人的嘴巴，恐吓他们，分裂他们，镇压他们。
    文章热情歌颂中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席。它指出：“今天国际共产主义运动中反对现代修正主义的先锋是中国共产党。中国共产党是世界上最大的共产党。在她的领导下，世界上最大的国家中国，正在走马克思列宁主义的革命道路，并且在完成苏联十月革命所没有完成的任务。”
    “中国今天是国际共产主义革命运动的领袖，是一切反帝斗争的积极支持者。中国在毛泽东同志领导下站在反对苏共修正主义领导集团的队伍的前列。在这场斗争中，中国不仅得到国际共产主义运动中日益壮大的反修力量的支持，而且得到他们的信任。”
    文章说，中国共产党的反对修正主义的斗争，敲响了苏联修正主义领导集团死亡的丧钟。因此，苏修千方百计要使中国受修正主义的影响，而且全力支持美帝国主义反对中国。今天美帝和苏修都在竭力进行反华的肮脏宣传，妄图孤立和搞垮中国。因此很明显，美帝和苏修完全勾结起来了。
    文章说，美帝国主义指使一些国家的反动派来包围中国，但是，过去的历史响亮地打击了这些制订包围政策的阴谋家。今后的历史将再次猛烈地打击阴谋包围中国的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　巴基斯坦《建设报》十四日发表文章指出，最近印度政府在中国—锡金边境向中国发动武装侵略，是美帝苏修对中国实行军事包围和挑衅的阴谋计划的一部分。
    文章说，当美国政府给予印度政府各种援助去进行反华活动的时候，苏联政府也同印度反动政府勾结，执行着同美帝国主义一样的反华政策。
