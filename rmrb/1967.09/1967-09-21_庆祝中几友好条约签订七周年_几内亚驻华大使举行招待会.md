Celebrating the Seventh Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty
Guinean Ambassador to China Holds Reception

According to Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Guinean Ambassador to China, Segou Kamara, said at the reception he held today to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty, "The People's Republic of China has firmly and unconditionally provided the greatest support to Guinea with the utmost enthusiasm, embodying Chairman Mao Zedong's theory that 'the people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of those who are still striving for liberation.'"

Ambassador Segou Kamara said, "The day seven years ago when the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty was signed holds special significance for the people of Guinea. After we rejected French colonial rule, they tried every means to isolate us, surround us, and strangle us. At that time, the great People's Republic of China, under the guidance of the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, brought us the invaluable aid of 700 million Chinese people and signed a historic friendship treaty with our country. This treaty has made a tremendous contribution to the defense of young, independent Guinea. We thank Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and we thank the Chinese experts working in Guinea. The people of Guinea will forever be close friends of the Chinese people."

Ambassador Segou Kamara enthusiastically said, "The People's Republic of China is making great strides in building a strong, prosperous, and red nation under the thought of Mao Zedong. Since the launch of the Cultural Revolution, these achievements have increased manifold. We congratulate these achievements, which are also our achievements."

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo said at the reception, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Chinese people regard the victories of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their anti-imperialist struggles as their own victories and give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles.'"

Luo Guibo said, "Our assistance to each other is mutual. The anti-imperialist struggle of the Guinean people is the greatest support for us. We firmly believe that as long as the people of Asia and Africa, and all oppressed nations and peoples of the world strengthen their unity, support each other, and persist in their struggles, they will definitely be able to thoroughly defeat imperialism and all reactionary forces. The Chinese people, who have gone through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will make greater contributions to the revolutionary cause of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world."

At the end of the reception, Ambassador Segou Kamara and the Chinese friends present together shouted, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Guinean people! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

　　庆祝中几友好条约签订七周年
　　几内亚驻华大使举行招待会
    据新华社二十日讯　几内亚驻中国大使塞古·卡马拉，今天在他举行的庆祝中几友好条约签订七周年的招待会上说，中华人民共和国坚定地、无条件地以最大的热情给予几内亚巨大的支援，体现了毛泽东主席关于“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”的理论。
    塞古·卡马拉大使说，七年前签订中几友好条约的日子，对几内亚人民来说有着特殊意义。因为在我们拒绝法国殖民主义统治以后，它们千方百计地孤立我们，包围我们，要扼杀我们的时候，伟大的中华人民共和国在尊敬的毛泽东主席的光辉思想指导下，给我们带来了七亿中国人民的极为宝贵的援助，同我国签订了具有历史意义的友好条约。这个条约对于维护年轻的独立的几内亚作出了巨大贡献。我们感谢中国人民的伟大导师毛主席，我们感谢在几内亚工作的中国专家。几内亚人民永远是中国人民的亲密朋友。
    塞古·卡马拉大使热情地说，中华人民共和国在建设强大繁荣和红彤彤的毛泽东思想的国家中飞跃前进。中国自从发动文化大革命以来，这些进步更是成倍地增长，我们祝贺这些成就，这些成就同样也是我们的成就。
    外交部副部长罗贵波在招待会上说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”
    罗贵波说，我们之间的援助是相互的。几内亚人民进行的反帝斗争就是对我们最大的支持。我们坚信，只要亚非人民，全世界被压迫民族和人民加强团结，相互支持，坚持斗争，就一定能够彻底打败帝国主义和一切反动势力。经过无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民，将对世界被压迫民族和人民的革命事业作出更大的贡献。
    招待会结束时，塞古·卡马拉大使和在场的中国朋友一起高呼：“中国人民和几内亚人民的友谊万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！”
