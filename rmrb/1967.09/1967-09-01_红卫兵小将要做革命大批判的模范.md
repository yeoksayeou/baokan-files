Currently, on the vast land of our great motherland, a vigorous movement of revolutionary criticism is unfolding against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is a great revolutionary movement to thoroughly bury revisionism, the most extensive, profound, and great ideological revolution in human history.

With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we must raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating down the fallen dogs, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, completely criticize and expose the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists represented by China's Khrushchev. We must thoroughly eliminate their poisonous influence, making them infamous forever and ensuring they never rise again. This has extremely significant practical and historical importance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm in our country will take a fairly long time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will persist in our country for a long time, and as a class ideology, it will persist in our country for a long time. If we do not fully recognize this situation or do not recognize it at all, we will make a great mistake and will neglect the necessary ideological struggle." We must always bear in mind these teachings from the great leaders of the proletarian revolution, fully recognize the class struggle in the ideological realm, and carry out this profound class struggle on the political, ideological, and cultural fronts. This revolutionary criticism movement is a sharp class struggle, a struggle to smash the capitalist restoration from the ideological perspective, a struggle to uproot revisionism, a struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought. This struggle must be victorious and will be victorious.

Of course, to carry out a good revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly eliminate the series of revisionist poisons spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road for a long time, we must have a high sense of political responsibility, a daring revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and at the same time, we must have a serious scientific attitude and tenacious revolutionary will.

By a high sense of political responsibility, we mean to be concerned with national affairs, to be concerned with where China is heading, where the world is heading, and the destiny and future of humanity.

By a daring revolutionary spirit of rebellion, we mean to be contemptuous of the enemy strategically and dare to criticize the "giant monsters" of the bourgeoisie. In short, we must have a revolutionary "fighting spirit" that fears neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts.

By a serious scientific attitude, we mean to be cautious of the enemy tactically, to have a scientific and realistic spirit, to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations and research on the enemy situation, to analyze it with Marxism-Leninism, to find the crux, and to criticize it thoroughly. We must not be superficial or careless.

By tenacious revolutionary will, we mean to have a fighting style of daring to struggle, fearing no difficulties, and never retreating. We must have the determination to fight to the end with the class enemy and must not lose heart or retreat halfway.

The revolutionary criticism of speaking and writing is a battle of ideas, an attack on ideological fortresses. Therefore, we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, think deeply, and think a lot. We must sit down and seriously study Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and criticize. Only by thinking deeply can we discover problems and achieve something.

We must see that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are extremely cunning and treacherous enemies with rich counter-revolutionary experience. For a long time, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, their counter-revolutionary activities are often carried out under the banner of "red," and their revisionist theories are all cloaked in Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, to expose and criticize their counter-revolutionary revisionist essence, we must work hard, use our brains, and devote our hearts to it.

Lenin teaches us: "If a communist does not exert extreme diligence, extreme hard work, and enormous effort to understand the things he must critically examine, but wants to show off his ready-made communist conclusions, such a communist is very pitiful. This attitude of not seeking thorough understanding is extremely harmful." "To analyze and examine various different situations, one must have one's own head on one's shoulders."

Shouldn't every revolutionary comrade seriously think about this passage from Lenin? Yes, absolutely! We oppose those who do not want to sit down and think deeply about problems, do not fully engage in criticism, but are interested in making a lot of noise.

We, Chairman Mao's Red Guards, are the most ruthless, thorough, and brave critics of the old world. We are the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the command of our great leader in the past, we raised high the banner of revolution, sang the songs of rebellion, and made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, we must continue to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively participate in the current revolutionary criticism movement, be exemplars of revolutionary criticism, and make new contributions and achievements for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　红卫兵小将要做革命大批判的模范
　　北京师范大学井冈山公社中文系联合大队“万水千山”战斗队
    当前，在我们伟大祖国土地上，正在轰轰烈烈地展开对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判运动，这是一场彻底埋葬修正主义的伟大革命运动，是人类历史上最广泛、最深刻、最伟大的思想革命运动。
    以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，高举革命批判的大旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的一小撮反革命修正主义分子批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒，使其遗臭万年，永世不得翻身，是有特别重大的现实意义和特别重大的历史意义的。
    毛主席教导我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”我们应当时刻记取无产阶级革命导师的这些教诲，充分地重视意识形态领域内的阶级斗争。目前，我们在政治思想文化战线上进行的这场革命大批判运动，就是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，就是从思想上粉碎资本主义复辟的斗争，是从思想上挖修正主义根子的斗争，是巩固无产阶级专政的斗争，是捍卫毛泽东思想的斗争。这场斗争一定要胜利，也一定能胜利。
    当然，要搞好革命的大批判，彻底肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派长期以来所散布的一系列的修正主义流毒，需要我们无产阶级革命派具有高度的政治责任感、大无畏的革命造反精神，同时还必须具有严肃的科学态度和顽强的革命毅力。
    所谓高度的政治责任感，就是要关心国家大事，关心中国向何处去、世界向何处去，关心人类的命运和前途。
    所谓大无畏的革命造反精神，就是在战略上要藐视敌人，敢于去批判那些资产阶级的“庞然大物”。一句话，就是要有一股子天不怕、地不怕、神不怕、鬼不怕的革命“杀劲”。
    所谓严肃的科学态度，就是要在战术上重视敌人，要有科学的求实精神，要对敌情作深入细致的调查研究，作马克思列宁主义的分析，找出要害，痛加批判。而绝不能蜻蜓点水，粗枝大叶。
    所谓顽强的革命毅力就是要有敢于斗争，不怕困难，决不退缩的战斗风格。就是要有与阶级敌人血战到底的决心，绝不能泄劲，更不能半路收兵。
    进行口诛笔伐的革命大批判，打的是思想战，攻的是思想堡垒。因此，必须遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，要善于思考，要多思。要安下心来，坐下来，认真地学习毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去分析、去批判。善于思考才能发现问题，才能有所作为。
    必须看到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是一些有着丰富的反革命经验的极端阴险狡猾的敌人。长期以来，在无产阶级专政的条件下，他们的反革命活动常常是打着“红旗”干的，他们的修正主义理论也都是披着马列主义外衣的，因此要暴露和批判他们反革命修正主义的实质，不用一番功夫，不动一番脑筋，不花一番心血，是不行的。
    列宁教导我们：“如果一个共产主义者不用一番极认真、极艰苦而浩繁的工夫，不理解他必须用批判的态度来对待的事物，便想根据自己学到的共产主义的现成结论来炫耀一番，这样的共产主义者是很可怜的。这种不求甚解的态度是极端有害的。”“为了能够分析和考察各个不同的情况，应该在肩膀上长着自己的脑袋。”
    难道我们每个革命的同志不应该认真地来想一想列宁的这一段教导吗？应该，太应该了！我们反对那些不愿很好地坐下来思考问题，不去全力以赴地进行大批判，而是对大吵大闹有兴趣的不良风气。
    我们毛主席的红卫兵是旧世界的最无情最彻底最勇敢的批判者，我们是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将。过去在我们伟大统帅的指挥下，我们高举革命的战旗，高唱造反的战歌，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。今天我们更应当继续发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极投入当前这场革命的大批判运动，做革命大批判的模范，为无产阶级文化大革命建新功，立新劳。
