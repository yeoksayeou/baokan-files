Tear Off the Mask of the Old Opportunist Tao Zhu
— A Critique of the Counter-Revolutionary Novel *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town*

Comrade Yao Wenyuan, in his article “Critique of Tao Zhu’s Two Books,” has systematically and deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu from the political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives using the penetrating Mao Zedong Thought. The publication of this article at this crucial juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an important part of Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and another great victory for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

Tao Zhu is a habitual counter-revolutionary two-faced opportunist who waves the “red flag” to oppose the red flag. He, starting from the political needs of the counter-revolutionary class, has been vigorously engaged in ideological work to prepare public opinion for the capitalist restoration plots of China’s Khrushchev. Over the years, the literary and artistic circles have produced many works that sing the praises of and erect monuments for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The novel *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town* is one of them.

*Spring and Autumn of a Small Town* is based on the Xiamen jailbreak incident in May 1930, in which Tao Zhu directly participated and took the lead. The novel portrays this incident as part of the underground struggle of the CCP in Xiamen during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and as the climax of the entire work, placing it in the latter half of the book. After the novel was published in December 1956, it attracted great attention and concern from Tao Zhu. He repeatedly commented on the novel, boasting with self-satisfaction that the jailbreak incident described in the novel was a “success” under his leadership. He also seized every opportunity to propagandize this so-called “glorious history” to gain political capital, attempting to portray himself as a “proletarian revolutionary.”

The Xiamen jailbreak incident, which Tao Zhu has been boasting about and which is praised in *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town*, was it the result of the correct line or a product of the “Left” opportunist line? Is Tao Zhu a proletarian revolutionary or an old opportunist? This major issue must be clarified.

The novel completely stands on the bourgeois standpoint, praising the wrong line as the correct one and glorifying the petty-bourgeois figures who implemented the wrong line as steadfast proletarian revolutionaries. It is a big poisonous weed that attempts to rehabilitate the “Left” opportunist line.

Let us first examine under what ideological guidance this jailbreak incident was carried out. On July 8, 1930, two months after the incident, the CCP Fujian Provincial Committee wrote a report to the Party Central Committee, which was then controlled by Li Lisan. The report clearly stated: “The Xiamen jailbreak movement was inevitably influenced by the intense mass struggle of the national revolution and the severe warning of the White Terror.” This incident, held during the time when the ruling class was on the verge of collapse and the revolutionary high tide was approaching, was a “rehearsal for armed uprisings” aimed at preparing for the proletariat to seize political power. It is clear that the basic ideology of this report (which was also the guiding ideology of the Fujian Provincial Committee for this jailbreak) was completely consistent with the “Left” opportunist line of Li Lisan, which then dominated the Party. Li Lisan and his followers completely misjudged the situation at that time, believing that the ruling class was about to collapse and that the revolutionary high tide was about to arrive. Therefore, they advocated using the Red Army to attack central cities, sparking armed uprisings in central cities to achieve the “first victory in one or several provinces,” thereby forming a so-called national revolutionary high tide and national victory.

The jailbreak incident led by Tao Zhu and others was launched under the guidance of this “Left” opportunist line. In 1930, the warlords of Chiang Kai-shek, Guan, and Yan were just beginning to fight each other, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were intensifying their fascist rule in the White Areas. In the island city of Xiamen, there were large numbers of naval forces, police, detectives, and many secret service agencies. According to Chairman Mao’s teachings, under such circumstances, the Party’s underground workers “should not adopt a rash and adventurist policy but should adopt a policy of concealment, concentration of forces, and awaiting the opportunity.” However, at that time, the Fujian Provincial Committee, led by Tao Zhu and others under the control of the Central Committee led by Li Lisan, implemented the “Left” adventurist policy, frequently organizing workers and students to hold frequent meetings and demonstrations without conditions, causing great harm to the Party’s work. Especially after the meeting held in that year to commemorate the Paris Commune on March 18, eighteen important cadres inside and outside the Party were arrested, leading to the destruction of the Fujian Provincial Committee twice. However, they not only failed to learn from the lessons of failure and organize a necessary strategic retreat but instead took more adventurous military actions in May—the armed jailbreak. Tao Zhu represented the Provincial Military Committee to participate in the Special Committee for the armed jailbreak operation and was appointed as the commander of the armed squad. He enthusiastically participated in the leadership and organization of this armed jailbreak. Under the circumstances at that time, holding such a military operation was impossible to win the sympathy and support of the broad masses, impossible to play a role in mobilizing the masses to join the revolutionary struggle, and could only cause the Party’s underground organization to lose its combat effectiveness. However, soon after this erroneous action, it was praised by the Party Central Committee, which was then controlled by Li Lisan. The novel *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town* even praised this incident with a very affirmative and approving attitude, spending a lot of ink to glorify and exaggerate this jailbreak incident, detailing the descriptions of the meetings and parades organized by the Xiamen underground party under the guidance of Li Lisan’s opportunist line. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu has been boasting about this armed jailbreak incident since 1956, saying that doing so is “correct” and “not the Li Lisan line.” This is like saying there are no silver coins here, which fully reveals his stubborn stance of adhering to the wrong line and opposing Chairman Mao’s correct line.

The consequences and impact of the jailbreak incident led by Tao Zhu are extremely harmful. Although this jailbreak incident was lucky to succeed due to the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the evaluation of a political incident should not only look at its immediate victory or defeat but must examine its essence and its impact on the overall revolutionary situation. After this incident, the enemy strengthened its vigilance and intensified the brutal suppression of the underground party and mass revolutionary activities in Xiamen, bringing great obstacles to the Party’s work in the White Areas. The report of the Fujian Provincial Committee to the Central Committee at that time also had to admit that “Xiamen was in chaos at that time, and the White Terror reached its peak.” What is even more infuriating is that Tao Zhu and others, instead of learning from this, were instead intoxicated by the temporary surface victory, claiming that this incident was a “great” and “complete” victory of the armed forces of workers and peasants. Immediately afterwards, in August, they organized an attack on the Salt Administration Bureau, a large-scale adventurist action that was openly exposed to the enemy in advance through the method of posting notices. Under the enemy’s full preparation and deployment, the revolutionary masses were suppressed, and two leading comrades were killed by the enemy on the same day. From the so-called “victory” of the Xiamen jailbreak to the failure of the attack on the Salt Administration Bureau, the underground party in Xiamen was completely exposed to the enemy, and the relationship between the Party’s peripheral organization “Mutual Aid Society” and the Party was also completely exposed. That winter, Tao Zhu was transferred from Xiamen to Zhangzhou to serve as the Secretary of the Special Committee. He still stubbornly implemented the “Left” opportunist line, leading the armed struggle in the Zhangzhou area to the wrong path of pure militarism and banditry, similarly bringing great harm to the work in that area. The jailbreak described in the novel is artistically processed. Tao Zhu and others propagated that the jailbreak had no casualties, but the book wrote that someone was killed by the enemy in the prison during the jailbreak. The protagonist of the novel, Si Min, who was fully praised, also died after being seriously injured and not rescued in time after breaking out of the prison; another protagonist, He Jianping, was almost captured by the enemy. Afterwards, the underground party organization in Xiamen was in a very difficult situation. The intention of the novel to write in this way is to praise those petty-bourgeois figures who implemented the wrong line as “heroes, tenacious, and fearless of sacrifice,” but it backfires, revealing the harm that the “Left” opportunist line necessarily brings to the revolution.

Everyone knows that after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the most important issue facing the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary people was: in semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, to achieve the victory of the new democratic revolution, should we follow the path of the vanguard of the proletariat deeply entering the countryside, leading the peasants to carry out armed struggles, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, and implementing the strategy of surrounding the cities from the countryside and then seizing national power? Or should we adopt the strategy of focusing on urban work, first occupying the central cities, and then attacking the countryside? This was the focal point of the struggle between Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and the three “Left” opportunist lines during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and it was also the fundamental issue of whether the Chinese revolution would succeed or fail. As early as January 1930, Chairman Mao, based on a scientific analysis of Chinese society, first clearly proposed the great strategic idea of “surrounding the cities from the countryside.” He said: “The establishment and development of the Red Army, guerrilla forces, and red areas are the highest form of peasant struggles under the leadership of the proletariat in semi-colonial China and the inevitable result of the development of semi-colonial peasant struggles; and undoubtedly, they are the most important factor in promoting the national revolutionary high tide.” Chairman Mao not only fought against the “Left” opportunists, such as Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and Bo Gu, who wore the cloak of “Marxism-Leninism” in theory but also corrected the harm that the “Left” opportunist line brought to the revolution in actual revolutionary struggles. The “Left” opportunists represented by Li Lisan, however, completely denied the essence of the bourgeois democratic revolution in China as a peasant war and failed to see the extreme importance of launching guerrilla wars in the countryside and establishing base areas. They always dreamed that the workers’ struggles in the cities and other mass struggles could suddenly break through the enemy’s high pressure and flourish. As soon as they encountered a favorable change in the situation for the revolution, they fantasized about promoting the national revolutionary high tide through armed uprisings in a few central cities and even attempted to achieve the overall victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution in one go. Tao Zhu and others regarded the Xiamen jailbreak incident as a “rehearsal for armed uprisings” to “welcome the arrival of the revolutionary high tide,” so this incident was completely wrong, completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought, and completely deviated from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. The reason why the Xiamen jailbreak incident led by Tao Zhu attracted such high attention from the Central Committee led by Li Lisan was that it could be used by them as a “successful example” to prove the “correctness” of the “Left” opportunist line. The novel *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town*, based on the Xiamen jailbreak incident, almost did not mention the importance of developing rural armed struggles and establishing revolutionary base areas but described in great detail the work of the underground party organization in Xiamen in the White Areas. When it came to the guerrilla areas near Xiamen, it completely wrote them as a supporting role for the struggles in the White Areas. The heroes praised in the novel were all petty-bourgeois elements detached from the workers and peasants, and fervent believers in the “Left” opportunist line. Whenever they could not stay in Xiamen, they would slip into the countryside to “avoid the wind.” The book is permeated with this thorough opportunist viewpoint.

The stern history mercilessly exposed Tao Zhu’s lies. The Xiamen jailbreak incident he participated in and led was not a victory of the correct line but a product of the Li Lisan line, which was opposed to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line; Tao Zhu was not a “proletarian revolutionary” who had “never made a line error” but an old opportunist who had always opposed Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, a fake revolutionary and counter-revolutionary.

After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the modern revisionist trend swept the world, and the forces of capitalist restoration in China were also eager to try. In May 1956, half a year before the publication of *Spring and Autumn of a Small Town*, Tao Zhu took the opportunity of the Longxi District Committee of Fujian compiling the revolutionary struggle history of Minnan to boast about his “glorious history” in Xiamen and Zhangzhou, Fujian. He shamelessly put gold on his face, saying that “we opposed the Li Lisan line. At that time, the Central Committee in Shanghai (Wang Ming, Bo Gu) sent instructions to transmit the anti-Li Lisan line, and we had basically settled the Li Lisan line.” Wang Ming, Bo Gu, and Li Lisan were all of the same breed, all old opportunists, and they could not possibly come to correct the errors of the Li Lisan line. How could Tao Zhu, who claimed to faithfully execute the instructions of Wang Ming and Bo Gu, come to settle the “Li Lisan line”? This is all nonsense and deceit! After the Xiamen jailbreak incident, Tao Zhu’s performance in Zhangzhou, with his pure military viewpoint and banditry, was enough to prove that he had not corrected the errors of the Li Lisan line but had instead intensified the execution of the “Left” opportunist line of Wang Ming and Bo Gu. However, in this conversation, Tao Zhu actually boasted about his military actions that completely violated Chairman Mao’s people’s war thought as correct experiences, saying that he was “firmly advocating armed struggle,” how he “led armed struggles to mobilize the masses,” and how “peasants benefited from the struggle.” He not only distorted history and glorified himself but also, like a vicious dog, bit back, cursing those revolutionary comrades who dared to insist on Chairman Mao’s correct line and advocated combining the land revolution with armed struggle as “mechanical” and “dogmatic.” This was a blatant attack on the great Mao Zedong Thought. Soon afterwards, the memoir *Record of the Xiamen Jailbreak*, based on Tao Zhu’s dictation, was published. The memoir described the “jailbreak” as if it were a miracle, exaggerating the role of this incident and claiming that the “achievements were enormous” and praising Tao Zhu, who was “responsible for organizing and leading” this action. This article was widely poisonous and was irrefutable evidence of Tao Zhu’s public rehabilitation of the “Left” opportunist line, a poisoned arrow shot at Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. In 1959, when the novel was translated into a foreign language, the preface written based on *Record of the Xiamen Jailbreak* spread the poison of this article again. In 1962, when the novel was reprinted, a new preface was written based on the preface of the foreign language version. The foreign language version was sold overseas, and the new version was widely circulated domestically, allowing Tao Zhu to gain a lot of political capital both domestically and internationally.

In 1961, during the sinister activities of domestic and foreign class enemies to restore capitalism, Tao Zhu, under the guise of summarizing Party history to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, allowed a small group of power-holders within the Fujian Provincial Committee who were taking the capitalist road to publish a big poisonous weed titled *Report on the Xiamen Jailbreak Work to the Party Central Committee in 1930*. In the commentary, it praised it as a “revolutionary document of great historical significance.” This commentary distorted history and glorified Tao Zhu and others, claiming that they “combined the great revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, conducted thorough investigations and meticulous arrangements, and bravely and wisely rescued the revolutionary comrades imprisoned in the Xiamen prison, writing a glorious page in the history of the revolution.”

Why did the Xiamen jailbreak incident make the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu so concerned that he repeatedly made a big deal out of it? Was Tao Zhu merely trying to settle old scores from over thirty years ago and portray himself as a hero in history? His sinister purpose was far from that. There is no history for history’s sake; history is used to serve the present struggle. Marx said well, summoning the ghosts of the past and bringing the dead back to life is to make them serve oneself. In the two major class struggles in New China, Tao Zhu eagerly jumped out to rehabilitate the wrong lines within the Party and viciously attacked Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, all to beautify the bourgeois reactionary line represented by China’s Khrushchev within the Party, aiming to oppose Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and to serve the bourgeois seizure of the Party, the army, and political power.

Tao Zhu’s stubborn adherence to the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not accidental. Tao Zhu and China’s Khrushchev are of the same ilk, both old opportunists. History is ruthless. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how well they disguise themselves, how deeply they hide, or how high they climb, will not have a good outcome. The fate of China’s Khrushchev is like this, and Tao Zhu’s fate will be no different.

    撕下老牌机会主义者陶铸的画皮
    ——评反动小说《小城春秋》		吴泰昌　马连儒　邹正贤　林心
    姚文元同志在《评陶铸的两本书》中，运用明察秋毫的毛泽东思想，从政治上、思想上、理论上对反革命两面派陶铸进行了系统的、深刻的批判。在无产阶级文化大革命的重要关头发表这篇文章，这是毛主席伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分，是毛主席革命路线的又一伟大胜利。
    陶铸是一个惯于打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派。他从反革命阶级的政治需要出发，大抓意识形态方面的工作，极力为中国的赫鲁晓夫阴谋复辟资本主义作舆论准备。多年以来，文艺界出现了不少为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派歌功颂德、树碑立传的作品，长篇小说《小城春秋》就是其中的一个。		一
    《小城春秋》是以陶铸直接参与和具体领导的一九三○年五月厦门劫狱事件为背景的。小说把这个事件作为第二次国内革命战争时期厦门党的地下斗争的一个组成部分，作为整个作品的高潮，安排在全书的后半部。作品自一九五六年十二月出版以后，引起了陶铸极大的注意和关心。他多次对小说发表意见，沾沾自喜地吹嘘说作品中所写的那次劫狱事件就是在他领导下取得“成功”的，并且一有机会就大肆宣扬这一段所谓“光荣的历史”，极力捞取政治资本，妄图把他自己打扮成一个“无产阶级革命家”。
    被陶铸拿来到处炫耀而又在《小城春秋》中得到歌颂的这一次厦门劫狱事件，到底是执行正确路线的结果，还是“左”倾机会主义路线指导下的产物？陶铸是无产阶级革命家，还是老牌的机会主义者？这个大是大非的问题我们一定要弄清楚。
    小说完全站在资产阶级的立场上，把错误路线当作正确路线来加以歌颂，把贯彻错误路线的小资产阶级人物美化成为坚定的无产阶级革命战士。这是一株为“左”倾机会主义路线翻案的大毒草。
    让我们先来看看这次劫狱事件是在什么思想指导下进行的。一九三○年七月八日，即事件发生以后两个月，中共福建省委给当时被李立三把持的党中央所写的报告，对这个问题作了明确的回答。报告中说：“厦门破狱运动的产生必然的是受了全国革命的群众斗争激烈的影响，和白色恐怖严厉的暗示”。而这次劫狱在“统治阶级日趋崩溃”、“革命高潮快到来”的时候举行，是“武装暴动的演习”，是为着准备“无产阶级起来夺取政权”。十分明显，这个报告的基本思想（也就是当时福建省委搞这次劫狱的指导思想），和那时在党内占统治地位的李立三“左”倾机会主义路线是完全一致的。李立三等人完全错误地估计了当时的斗争形势，认为统治阶级就要完蛋了，革命高潮就要到来了，因此，主张用红军攻打中心城市，掀起中心城市的武装起义，以实现夺取“一省或数省的首先胜利”，从而形成所谓全国革命高潮和全国胜利。
    陶铸等人领导的劫狱事件就是在这种“左”倾机会主义路线的指导下发动的。一九三○年，蒋桂阎军阀混战刚刚开始，国民党反动派在白区加紧实行法西斯的残酷统治。在厦门这个海岛城市里，驻有大批海军，派遣了人数众多的警察、侦探，设立了很多特务机关。按照毛主席的教导，在这种形势下，党的地下工作者“不能采取急性病的冒险主义的方针，必须采取荫蔽精干、积蓄力量、以待时机的方针。”但是，当时福建省委陶铸等人却在李立三把持的中央领导下，执行“左”倾冒险主义的政策，经常无条件地组织工人学生举行频繁的集会和示威，给党的工作造成很大的损害。特别是在当年为庆祝“三·一八”巴黎公社纪念日而举行的集会以后，就有十八个党内外重要干部被捕，导致福建省委机关两次遭受破坏。然而他们非但不接受失败的教训，组织必要的战略退却，反而在五月采取了更为冒险的军事行动——武装劫狱。陶铸代表省委军委会参加了破监武装行动特委会，并被指定为武工队队长。他十分起劲地参与了领导和组织这次武装劫狱的工作。在当时的情况下举行这种军事行动，根本不可能赢得广大群众的同情和支持，不可能起到发动群众投入革命斗争的作用，而只能使党的地下组织丧失其战斗力。可是，这一错误行动发生后不久，却得到了当时被李立三所把持的党中央的表扬。而《小城春秋》居然以十分肯定、赞扬的态度，不惜花费大量笔墨，拚命美化、渲染这次劫狱事件，把厦门地下党组织在李立三机会主义路线指导下所组织的集会游行等等，加以详细的描绘。反革命修正主义分子陶铸从一九五六年以来多次得意洋洋地吹嘘这次武装劫狱事件，说这样搞是“对的”，“不是立三路线”。这真是此地无银三百两，足以表明他坚持错误路线反对毛主席正确路线的顽固立场。
    陶铸参与和领导的这次劫狱事件的后果和影响是极其恶劣的。这次劫狱事件，虽然因为国民党反动派的腐败无能，缺乏防备，侥幸地取得成功，但是，对于一个政治事件的评价，决不能只看它一时的胜负，而必须看它的实质，并且联系它对以后整个革命形势的影响来考察。这次事件以后，引起了敌人严密的防范，再次加强了对厦门地下党和群众革命斗争活动的残酷镇压，给党的白区工作带来了巨大的障碍。福建省委当时给中央的报告也不得不承认“厦门这时简直闹得满城风雨，白色恐怖到了极高度了”。更令人气愤的是，陶铸等人非但没有从中吸取教训，相反却被一时的表面的胜利冲昏了头脑，把这个事件说成是工农武装力量“伟大”、“完满的胜利”。紧接着在八月间，组织了攻打盐管局的飞行集会，这次大规模的盲动行动，事先以贴告示的方式，公开暴露给敌人，在敌人充分准备与布置之下，革命群众遭到镇压，两个带队的领导同志当天就被敌人杀害。从厦门劫狱的所谓“胜利”到攻打盐管局的失败，厦门的地下党便完全暴露在敌人面前，党的外围组织“互济会”同党的关系也完全公开。这一年冬天，陶铸从厦门调到漳州担任特委书记，他仍然顽固执行“左”倾机会主义路线，把漳州地区的武装斗争引向了单纯军事观点和流寇主义的邪路，同样给这个地区的工作带来了极大的危害。《小城春秋》所描写的劫狱是经过艺术处理的。陶铸等人宣扬劫狱无一伤亡，而书中写劫狱时就有人被敌人打死在狱里，小说全力歌颂的主人公四敏也在冲出监狱后，因身负重伤又得不到及时的营救而死去；另一个主人公何剑平则险些被敌人抓去。此后厦门地下党组织处于很难活动的困境。小说这样写的用意是为了歌颂那些执行错误路线的小资产阶级人物的“英雄、顽强，不怕牺牲”，然而弄巧成拙，这倒说明了“左”倾机会主义路线必然给革命造成的危害。
    大家都知道，一九二七年大革命失败以后，摆在中国共产党人和革命人民面前的一个头等重大的问题，就是：在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，要取得新民主主义革命的胜利，应该走什么样的道路？是以无产阶级先锋队深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村革命根据地，实行农村包围城市而后夺取全国政权的方针呢，还是采取以城市工作为中心，首先占领中心城市，然后攻打农村的方针？这是第二次国内革命战争时期毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同三次“左”倾机会主义路线斗争的焦点，也是把中国革命引向成功或失败的根本问题。毛主席早在一九三○年一月就根据对中国社会的科学分析，第一次明确地提出了“农村包围城市”的伟大战略思想。他说：“红军、游击队和红色区域的建立和发展，是半殖民地中国在无产阶级领导之下的农民斗争的最高形式，和半殖民地农民斗争发展的必然结果；并且无疑义地是促进全国革命高潮的最重要因素。”毛主席不仅在理论上对披着“马列主义理论”外衣的李立三和后来的王明、博古等“左”倾机会主义者作了针锋相对的斗争，而且在实际革命斗争中纠正了“左”倾机会主义路线给革命带来的危害。以李立三为代表的“左”倾机会主义者却根本否认中国资产阶级民主革命的实质是农民战争，也根本看不到在农村发动游击战争、建立根据地的极端重要性，而总梦想城市的工人斗争和其它群众斗争能突然冲破敌人的高压而蓬勃发展，只要一遇到时局对革命有利的变动，就幻想通过几个中心城市的武装起义，促成全国革命的高潮，并妄图一举取得民主革命和社会主义革命的总胜利。陶铸等人就是把厦门的劫狱事件看作是“迎接革命高潮的到来”前的“武装暴动的演习”，因此这个事件是完全错误的，是完全违背毛泽东思想的，是完全背离毛主席的革命路线的。陶铸领导的厦门劫狱事件所以引起李立三的中央如此高度的重视，就是因为它可以被他们用来当作一个“胜利的范例”，证明“左”倾机会主义路线的“正确”。以厦门劫狱事件为背景而写成的《小城春秋》，几乎没有一处提到发展农村武装斗争和建立革命根据地的重要性，却以极大篇幅描写厦门地下党组织领导的白区工作，而在涉及厦门附近的农村游击区时，又完全把它写成为白区斗争服务的陪衬。小说中讴歌的一些英雄人物，尽是脱离工农群众的小资产阶级分子，“左”倾机会主义路线的狂热信徒。每当他们在厦门呆不住了，就溜到农村去“避风”。贯穿全书的，正是这种彻头彻尾的机会主义观点。
    严峻的历史无情地戳穿了陶铸的谎言。他参与领导的厦门劫狱事件，根本不是什么正确路线的胜利，而是与毛主席革命路线相对立的立三路线指导下的产物；陶铸根本不是什么“未犯过路线错误”的“一贯革命”的“无产阶级革命家”，而是一个一贯对抗毛主席的革命路线的老牌机会主义者，是一个地地道道的假革命、反革命。			二
    苏共二十大以后，国际现代修正主义思潮泛滥，国内资本主义复辟势力也跃跃欲试。一九五六年五月，也就是在《小城春秋》出笼的半年以前，陶铸乘福建龙溪地委编写闽南革命斗争史的机会，大肆吹嘘自己在福建厦门、漳州那一段“光荣历史”。他竟然厚颜无耻地往自己脸上贴金，说什么“立三路线我们是反对的。当时上海的中央（王明、博古）派来传达反立三路线的指示，我们已经基本上清算了立三路线”。王明、博古和李立三纯属一丘之貉，同样都是老牌机会主义者，他们根本不可能来纠正立三路线的错误。自称忠实地执行王明、博古指示的陶铸又怎么可能来清算“立三路线”呢？这完全是一派胡言，欺人之谈！厦门劫狱事件后，陶铸在漳州工作中表现出来的单纯军事观点和流寇主义的错误做法，就足以证明他丝毫没有改正立三路线的错误，反而变本加厉地执行了王明、博古的“左”倾机会主义路线。可是，陶铸在这次谈话中，竟然把他那一套完全违反毛主席人民战争思想的流寇主义的军事行动，当作正确的经验来炫耀，说他是“坚决主张搞武装斗争的”，如何“带着武装发动群众”，使“农民在斗争中得到利益”。他不仅歪曲历史，美化自己，而且象恶狗一样反咬一口，大骂敢于坚持毛主席正确路线、主张把土地革命和武装斗争结合起来的革命同志是“机械”的“教条主义”，这是明目张胆地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。不久以后，根据陶铸口述而写成的回忆录《厦门破监记》出笼了。回忆录把“破监”描写得神乎其神，竭力夸大这次事件的作用，胡说什么“成绩是非常巨大的”，并对“负责组织和领导”这次行动的陶铸大肆吹捧。这篇文章流毒极广，是陶铸公然为“左”倾机会主义路线翻案的铁证，是射向毛主席革命路线的一支毒箭。一九五九年小说译成外文时，根据《厦门破监记》写的序言，又一次传播了该文的毒素。一九六二年小说重版时，在外文版序的基础上又写了再版序言。外文版销售国外，新版在国内大量发行，为陶铸在国内外大捞了一笔政治资本。
    一九六一年，在国内外阶级敌人阴谋复辟资本主义的罪恶活动中，陶铸假借纪念中国共产党成立四十周年总结党史之名，在他的默许下，由福建省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，抛出了题为《一九三○年中共福建省委关于厦门破狱工作向党中央的报告》的大毒草，并且在按语中吹捧它是“一篇有重大历史意义的革命文献”。这个按语竟颠倒历史，极力美化陶铸等人，胡说什么，他们“在敌我力量悬殊的情况下，把伟大的革命精神和科学求实精神结合起来，经过充分的调查研究和周密的部署，勇敢机智，迅速而成功地拯救了被囚禁在厦门监狱的革命同志，为革命写下了光辉的史迹。”
    厦门劫狱事件为什么会使反革命修正主义分子陶铸如此重视，以致在这个问题上一再大做文章呢？陶铸真的仅仅是为了翻三十多年前的老账，把自己打扮成历史的英雄吗？他的阴险的目的决不仅如此。没有为历史而历史的，历史是用来为现实斗争服务的。马克思说得好，召唤过去的幽灵，使死人复活起来，是为了替自己效劳。陶铸在新中国成立以来两次大的阶级搏斗中，都迫不及待地跳出来为党内错误路线翻案，恶毒攻击毛主席的革命路线，就是为了美化党内以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的旨在反对毛主席革命路线的资产阶级反动路线，从而为资产阶级篡党篡政篡军效劳。
    陶铸在无产阶级文化大革命中顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线，这绝不是偶然的。陶铸和中国的赫鲁晓夫是一路货，都是老牌的机会主义者。历史是无情的。谁要反对毛主席的革命路线，反对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，不管你伪装得多好，隐藏得多深，爬得多高，都决不会有什么好下场。中国的赫鲁晓夫的命运是这样，陶铸的命运也只能是这样。
