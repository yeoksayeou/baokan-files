	Take Immediate Action to Win the Battle of Autumn Harvest and Sowing
		(I)
	Currently, the peasants in the main cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi have begun picking new cotton; other autumn crops such as corn, beans, sorghum, and millet will soon be harvested one after another. At the same time, the intense autumn sowing is about to begin. As the saying goes, "If you want a good harvest, you must plant good seeds." To ensure a good harvest of wheat next year, we must start preparing the land, conserving moisture, and fertilizing now. In short, we must win the battle of autumn harvest and sowing.

	Now, the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in our area have already taken active action. However, some people still have a complacent and relaxed attitude, which needs to be overcome. Some people oppose revolution and production, saying, "Wait until the great criticism of the revolution is over, then we will focus on production." A few leading cadres of the communes and production teams, after being criticized by the masses, cannot stand up straight and dare not lead production boldly. Especially, some capitalist roaders within the party collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, secretly inciting some uninformed masses to go to the city to engage in armed struggles, attempting to achieve their evil goal of destroying production and the Cultural Revolution.

	To do a good job in the current autumn harvest and sowing, it is a major task related to the increase in agricultural production this year and next year and the entire national economy, and it is also a major task related to consolidating the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. We poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres must strictly implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao, use the great criticism of the revolution as a driving force, and do a good job in production. Each commune and production team should make proper arrangements and mobilize the peasants who are staying in the city to immediately return to their production posts. Some cadres who have made mistakes should stand up straight and work actively to make amends for their mistakes. Those class enemies who engage in sabotage activities must be exposed mercilessly among the masses and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be firmly implemented.

	Time waits for no one. Let us take immediate action to win the battle of autumn harvest and sowing.

		(II)
	Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many places in Hubei this year have seen autumn crops grow with thick stalks, lush leaves, large ears, and full grains. Wild crops are also very lush, indicating a bumper harvest in the autumn.

	Due to the universal increase in autumn crops, the quantity is large, and the varieties are many, the harvesting period is concentrated, and it is urgent to organize labor to complete the harvesting task in a timely manner. This year's labor arrangement should be comprehensive, both large and small items should be taken care of; both domestic and wild crops should be taken care of (many wild plants are industrial raw materials and local specialties), and truly achieve the goal of "every grain into the barn, every treasure down the mountain."

	The two letters from readers today timely propose suggestions for doing a good job in autumn harvest and sowing, which are worth the attention of the revolutionary masses of peasants and cadres in rural areas. Time waits for no one. We should take immediate action to grasp this work well. Those who are still staying in the city should immediately return to their production posts and actively participate in the autumn harvest and sowing.

	"Grasp revolution, promote production," in the current situation, means to use the great criticism of the revolution as a driving force to promote autumn harvest and sowing. As long as the arrangements are appropriate and the combination is good, both the great criticism of the revolution can be done well and the production tasks can be guaranteed to be completed satisfactorily.

### 立即行动起来，打好秋收秋种这一仗

专栏：革命群众来信

    立即行动起来，打好秋收秋种这一仗
        （一）
    目前，陕西主要产棉区的社员已开始采摘新棉；其他秋作物，如玉米、豆子、高粱、谷子等，也将陆续收割。同时，紧张的秋播就要开始。俗话说：“要想收成好，就得种好苗。”为了争取明年麦子的好收成，眼前必须动手做好整地、保墒、送肥等准备工作。总之，一定要打好秋收秋播这一仗。
    现在，我们这里的广大社员和革命干部，已经积极行动起来。但是，有的人还有麻痹松劲情绪，急需克服。有的人把革命和生产对立起来，说什么“等革命大批判告一个段落，再来抓生产”。少数社队领导干部，在受到了群众批评后，挺不起腰来，不敢大胆领导生产。特别是，有的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结地、富、反、坏、右，暗地挑唆一些不明真相的群众，进城搞武斗，妄图达到他们破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。
    搞好当前的秋收秋播工作，是关系到今年和明年农业增产和整个国民经济的一件大事，也是关系到巩固文化大革命成果的一件大事。我们贫下中农和革命干部，一定要不折不扣地执行毛主席提出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把革命的大批判作为动力，搞好生产。各社队应当做出妥善安排，并动员逗留在城市里的社员，立即返回生产岗位。犯过错误的某些干部应当挺起腰杆，积极工作，将功补过。对于那些进行破坏活动的阶级敌人，一定要在群众中加以无情揭发，坚决地实行无产阶级专政。
    季节不等人，让我们立即行动起来，打好秋收秋播这一仗。

              （二）
    在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，今年湖北好多地方的秋庄稼长得秆粗叶茂，穗大粒饱。野生作物也长得很茂盛，看来秋季有个大丰收。
    由于秋庄稼普遍增产，数量大，品种多，收割期集中，组织好劳力，不失时机地完成收割任务，就成了当前很急迫的事。今年安排劳力，要做到全面兼顾，既要抓大宗的，也要抓小宗的；既要抓家生的，也要抓野生的（许多野生植物都是工业原料和土特产），要真正做到颗粒归仓，百宝下山。

    今天的两封读者来信，及时提出了搞好秋收秋种的建议，很值得农村的无产阶级革命派、贫下中农和革命干部注意。季节不等人，我们应当立即行动起来，把这项工作切实抓好。现在还逗留在城市的社员，要立即返回生产岗位，积极参加秋收秋种。
    “抓革命，促生产”，在当前来说，就是要以革命的大批判为动力，推动秋收秋种。只要安排得当，结合得好，既可以搞好革命的大批判，也一定能保证生产任务的圆满完成。
