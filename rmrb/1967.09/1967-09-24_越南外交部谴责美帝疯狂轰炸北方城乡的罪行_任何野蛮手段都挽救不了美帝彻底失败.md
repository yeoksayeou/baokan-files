Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Denounces U.S. Imperialists' Savage Bombing of Northern Cities and Villages
No Brutal Means Can Save U.S. Imperialists from Total Defeat

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 19 -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on September 19 strongly condemning the savage crimes committed by U.S. imperialists who have been using aircraft, warships, and artillery to relentlessly attack various towns and villages in the Vinh Linh district and Quang Binh province of North Vietnam. The statement said that on September 17, the military and people of Vinh Linh district shot down two invading U.S. B-52 bombers, which serves as a powerful warning to the U.S. aggressors: no matter how brutal the means, they cannot save the U.S. imperialists from total defeat.

	The statement said that in the past two months, U.S. aircraft, warships, and artillery stationed south of the demilitarized zone have been conducting extremely savage attacks on various towns and villages in the Vinh Linh district and Quang Binh province of North Vietnam, day and night.

	The statement said that especially in the demilitarized zone and the villages just north of it, the U.S. has been using B-52 bombers for increasingly severe bombing. Since mid-August this year, U.S. B-52 bombers have bombed this region more than 80 times. The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialists are still stubbornly intensifying and expanding their war of aggression against Vietnam, committing more and more new crimes against the Vietnamese people. The statement said that the more brutal and savage the U.S. imperialists become, the more the Vietnamese people hate them. The Vietnamese people are resolved with iron will to give the U.S. aggressors the punishment they deserve.
