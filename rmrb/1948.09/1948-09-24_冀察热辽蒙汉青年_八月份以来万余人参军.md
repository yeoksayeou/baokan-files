Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning, 10th. People in the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning liberated area, from the coast of the Bohai Sea to the grasslands of northern Chahar, are engaged in a widespread movement to join the army. According to incomplete statistics, more than 12,000 people have signed up to join the army since August. In Ming'an Banner of northern Chahar, after the People's Liberation Army recovered cattle and sheep for the herders from the Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, 139 young people joined the army. People in the newly recovered areas are also joining the army in large numbers to avenge themselves on the Kuomintang bandit troops. In the seventh district of Leting County, Hebei Province, which was newly recovered, more than 540 young people have enlisted.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Kuomintang soldiers liberated in Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning and East China have gradually improved their political awareness after short-term study and speaking-bitterness movements, and have requested to join the People's Liberation Army to kill enemies and make meritorious services. A unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Jidong Military Region held a welcome meeting for 266 liberated soldiers who joined the army on August 23rd at its驻地. In the Rehe-Liaoning sub-district, 254 liberated soldiers joined the People's Liberation Army. 458 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers liberated in the Jiaoji central section campaign in East China have also recently been approved to formally join a unit of the People's Liberation Army.

    【新华社冀察热辽一十日电】冀察热辽解放区从渤海沿岸到察北草原的人民正在进行普遍的参军运动。据不完全统计，八月以来报名参军者已达一万二千余人。察北草原明安旗的青年在解放军为牧民自傅作义匪军夺回牛羊后，参军者达一百三十九人。新收复区人民为向国民党匪军报仇，亦大量参军。新收复的冀东乐亭县七区已有五百四十余青年入伍。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】冀察热辽和华东各地被解放的国民党军士兵，经短期学习与诉苦运动后，政治觉悟逐渐提高，纷纷请求参加解放军杀敌立功。冀东军区解放军某部于八月二十三日在驻地举行二百六十六名解放战士入伍欢迎大会。热辽分区有二百五十四名解放战士参加了解放军。华东胶济中段战役中被解放的蒋军士兵四百五十八人，最近亦经批准正式参加解放军某部。
