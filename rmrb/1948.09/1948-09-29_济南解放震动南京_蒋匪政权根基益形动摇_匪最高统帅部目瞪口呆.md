Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: The great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinan on the 24th and completely annihilating the defending enemy has stunned the Kuomintang's Supreme Headquarters. This is how the Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 25th described it. The dispatch said that this was a "military victory that shook the foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's regime. Because its impact is so significant, the Kuomintang government and the newspapers in Nanjing controlled by the Kuomintang have suppressed the news of the loss of Jinan." The Kuomintang government, as late as the 25th, "was unwilling to officially admit its complete fall, attempting to mitigate its fatal blow to the political, military, and economic structure of China (Kuomintang-controlled areas)." The foolish Kuomintang rumor company, the Central News Agency, even on the day after Jinan was completely liberated, vigorously promoted its imaginary Wang Yaowu's troops in Jinan "fighting for every house" with the People's Liberation Army, "engaging in desperate hand-to-hand combat," and "repeatedly launching counter-attacks outward from the inner city." Even on the 26th, it was still promoting the so-called defending troops inside the city "echoing" the fighting outside the city. People here say: The panicked bandits have become so weak that they can only rely on daily lies to maintain their crumbling rule. Even if these lies only last for a day, they are necessary for them, because after people know the truth, the most dangerous impact will be relatively缓和, and they will feel like they can still survive. In the Kaifeng campaign in June, the defending enemy was completely annihilated, but the Central News Agency spread rumors that they "withdrew to the suburbs to continue to strike the stubborn bandits." In the Henan-East Campaign, the Kuomintang lost 50,000 troops, and Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian were captured, but in the Central News Agency's words, it became an "unprecedented great victory." The loss of Yanzhou was a "planned retreat"; Kang Ze's capture was also publicized as "heroic martyrdom." The Central News Agency will never admit the complete annihilation of Jinan's entire army, and the Jinan defending enemy, with no way to go to heaven and no way to go to earth, cannot "transfer to a favorable position under orders because the strategic mission has been achieved"; then, let's see how the Central News Agency will report on this unprecedented victory of the People's Liberation Army in Jinan.

### 济南解放震动南京　蒋匪政权根基益形动摇　匪最高统帅部目瞪口呆

　　济南解放震动南京
  　蒋匪政权根基益形动摇
  　匪最高统帅部目瞪口呆
    【新华社济南二十七日电】人民解放军二十四日解放济南全歼守敌的伟大胜利，已使国民党最高统帅部惊惶得目瞪口呆。这是二十五日南京美联社电讯的描写。该讯说，这是一个“动摇蒋介石政权根基的军事胜利。因为它的影响是如此重大，所以国民党政府与国民党控制下的南京各家报纸，都压下了济南丧失的消息”。国民党政府迟至二十五日，“还不愿正式承认其完全失陷，企图缓和其对中国（国民党统治区）政治、军事与经济结构的致命打击”。愚蠢的国民党造谣公司中央社在济南已被完全解放之次日，还大肆宣传其幻想中的王耀武部队在济南与解放军“逐屋争夺”，“拚死肉搏”，“自内城迭次向外反复突击”。甚至廿六日还在宣传所谓城内守军与城外“互相呼应”作战。此间人士称：惊慌失措的匪帮已经虚弱到如此程度，只能依赖每天的谎言来维持其摇摇欲坠的统治，这种谎言纵然只能维持一天的时效，对于他们也是必要的，因为等到人们都知道事实的真相以后，它的最危险的冲击力量就会比较和缓一点，他们就觉得似乎还可以活命了。在六月开封之役，守敌全歼，中央社却造谣说是“撤至郊外，续予顽匪以打击”。豫东之役，国民党丧师五万，区寿年、沈澄年被俘，在中央社口中却变成“空前大捷”。兖州的失守，则是“有计划之转进”；康泽的被俘，又宣传“壮烈殉职”。中央社是决不会承认济南的全军覆灭的，而上天无路，入地无门的济南守敌又无法“因战略任务已达，奉命转移有利阵地”；那么，我们且看中央社将如何来报导解放军这一次济南的空前大捷吧。
