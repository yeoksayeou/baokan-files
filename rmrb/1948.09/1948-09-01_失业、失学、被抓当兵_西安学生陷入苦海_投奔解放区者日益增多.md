Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: According to various sources, Xi'an students are currently trapped in an abyss of unemployment, school dropout, and forced conscription. Of the nearly one thousand students graduating from colleges and universities in the city this semester, the majority are unable to find jobs. Even in the case of the Business College, where job opportunities are relatively plentiful, less than half of the 130 graduates have employment prospects. Furthermore, the vast majority of the more than two thousand high school graduates have no opportunities for further education or employment. Tuition fees at all private primary and secondary schools have sharply increased for the next semester. Secondary school tuition fees are now collected in kind, with junior high students required to pay three bags of machine-milled flour per student, and senior high students required to pay four bags (in early July, the factory price was over 7.2 million per bag). Primary school tuition fees are over one million enemy currency. Of the more than 72,000 school-age children in the city, over 37,000 were already out of school; after this tuition increase, the number of dropouts will increase even further.

Hu Zongnan's bandit 119th Brigade openly went to the "National" 22nd Middle School to forcibly conscript students. When a student from Northwestern University was seized on the street and produced his school certificate, it was immediately torn to shreds. Although threatened by school dropout and hunger, the students still refused to sell their lives for Hu Zongnan. When Hu Zongnan asked the Law School of Northwestern University for one hundred people to train as so-called "suppression of banditry and national reconstruction" cadres, no one volunteered. Hu Zongnan sent his secretary to personally lobby and bribe, but still no one volunteered. The students said, "Who wants to go and die for Hu Zongnan?!" Before Yuncheng was liberated, students who had been lured to Xi'an under the coercion and supervision of Hu Zongnan's bandits were "welcomed" on the very first day of their arrival with posters all over the streets announcing "Recruiting Youth Army." The next day, these notices were posted on the students' doors, and the third day they were posted inside the students' rooms, but still no one signed up. So on the fourth day, Hu Zongnan sent his staff to openly threaten that "if you don't sign up, food rations will be stopped." The students immediately protested: "We would rather die than be conscripted!" As a result, food rations were immediately stopped. Five or six hundred people were crammed into the Shanxi Guild Hall at night, and roamed the streets during the day, suffering terribly under the torment of school dropout, unemployment, and hunger.

Under the persecution and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, an increasing number of students from Xi'an are voluntarily seeking refuge in the liberated areas. For example, students Song Changbin, Liu Baichuan, and others from Huayin County arrived safely in Luoyang in early July, and the democratic government has made proper arrangements for them. The students from Yuncheng who were deceived into going to Xi'an are also returning to southern Shanxi in a steady stream. The democratic government has set up reception centers to solve their living and learning problems. When Wang Lianbo, who had returned, spoke about the persecution suffered under the Kuomintang at a meeting of family members of students who had been deceived in Yuncheng, the families present all wept bitterly, demanding that the democratic government quickly rescue them. With the help of the democratic government, the number of students seeking refuge in and returning to the liberated areas is increasing daily.

### 失业、失学、被抓当兵　西安学生陷入苦海　投奔解放区者日益增多

　　失业、失学、被抓当兵
  　西安学生陷入苦海
  　投奔解放区者日益增多
    【新华社西北二十九日电】据各方消息：西安学生正陷于失业、失学及被抓去当兵的苦海中。该市本学期专科以上学校毕业的学生计近千人，大半找不到职业。即以就业机会较多的商专而论，毕业生一百三十人中，有就业机会者尚不及半数；而高中毕业的二千余学生，更绝大多数得不到升学或就业机会。各私立中小学，下学期学费均激增。中学学费改征实物，初中每生须交机器面粉三袋，高中每生四袋（七月初每袋厂价即在七百二十万以上）。小学学费在敌钞百万以上。该市学龄儿童七万二千余名中，原有三万七千余名失学，经此次学费增加后，失学人数将更增多。
    胡匪之一一九旅曾公开到“国立”二十二中学抓学生当兵。西北大学某生在街上被抓时，拿出学校证书，但立即被撕得粉碎。虽然在失学与饥饿的威胁下，学生仍拒绝为胡匪卖命，胡匪向西大法学院要一百人去训练作所谓“戡建”干部，但无人报名，胡匪派秘书去亲自活动收买，仍然无人报名，学生们说：“谁愿意去给胡宗南送死呢？！”运城未解放前在胡匪威迫监押下被诱骗至西安的学生，在到达的第一天，胡匪即在街上满贴“招收青年军”来“欢迎”他们，第二天这些布告就贴到学生门口，第三天就贴到学生房子，但还是没有一个人去报名。于是第四天胡匪即派其参谋公开以“如不报名即停发粮食”相威胁，学生们随即提出抗议：“叫当兵，我们宁死不干！”于是伙食立即被停发，五、六百人黑夜挤在山西会馆里，白天流浪街头，在失学、失业与饥饿熬煎下痛苦不堪。
    在国民党反动派迫害与摧残下，西安学生自动投奔解放区者正日益增多，如华阴县学生宋长斌、刘百川等多人即于七月初安抵洛阳，民主政府均妥为安置。而被骗到西安的运城学生，亦络绎返回晋南，民主政府特设招待所，以解决他们的生活及学习问题。当归来的王连伯在运城被骗员生家属会议上谈及受国民党迫害情形时，到会家属均嚎啕大哭，要求民主政府赶快拯救他们。现在民主政府帮助下，投奔及返回解放区的学生日众。
