A certain company of a unit in the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region conducted timely reality education in the operational marching environment of protecting the wheat harvest in northern Henan and covering the repair of the Yellow River dikes in June and July, which played a significant role in consolidating the troops. The following is a description of how they did it: When protecting the wheat harvest in the Fengqiu and Yanjin areas of northern Henan, they frequently pursued the enemy, the weather was hot, and life was hard, so everyone's morale was somewhat low. The instructor asked everyone to investigate the living conditions of the masses. In Xin'an Village, the soldiers investigated that an old man was buried alive along with his entire family of five by the bandit Wang Sanzhu because he said the Eighth Route Army was good. The bandit Wang Sanzhu forced the people to beg for food everywhere. The instructor used the above materials in three lectures, and the class discussed it once. The soldiers said, "Wang Sanzhu really doesn't let people live! We must fight him to the death." In several encounters, the soldiers of the company asked to fight a good battle.
    After Kaifeng was captured, people from the city came to the liberated areas as if they were going to a fair. The company's cadres discussed that this was a good opportunity to educate the soldiers, so in the morning they mobilized the soldiers to ask the people coming out of the city what Kaifeng was like. In the soldiers' inquiries, some said, "The Eighth Route Army's artillery is really powerful, one shot destroys a blockhouse." Some said, "The Eighth Route Army is so good! The proclamation only arrests Liu Maoen, and others who don't carry guns are fine." The fleeing landlords said, "We are going home to divide the land and live a good life." The quartermaster of the company's fellow villager was afraid of being mobilized to join the army, so he ran to Kaifeng and was wounded in the head by bombing. This time he ran back as well. People who were liberated from prison were especially affectionate to us. After this investigation, the soldiers said one after another: "Kaifeng has been opened, releasing so many 'propagandists'. After hearing what they said, I think Chiang Kai-shek will be finished in less than three years." Some said, "Running away at this time is really stupid!"
    After protecting the wheat harvest, they went to the south bank of the Yellow River to cover the repair of the dam. As soon as they were stationed in Sangcun Village, they were bombed by enemy planes. Five planes bombed the village into a mess. Some peddlers were bombed to death, and two demobilized soldiers were also injured. Although the company was not hit, some were afraid of Chiang's planes and unwilling to go to Henan to cover the repair of the dam. The instructor gave a class based on this situation, saying that if Chiang Kai-shek is not eliminated, no one can live in peace. You see that the demobilized comrades who were bombed said: "We have to go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek." After class, the soldier Shi Fu said: "This lecture is like washing your face with cold water after a nap (meaning it is refreshing). We can't live a good life without eliminating Chiang Kai-shek."
    When they went to Henan to cover the masses in repairing the dangerous works at Gao Village, they heard that more than 110 migrant workers had been injured by airplanes in the past few days, so they gave the soldiers temporary education, and the soldiers said with hatred: "How could China produce a bastard like Chiang Kai-shek, making the people so miserable!"
    After the task of covering the repair of the dike was completed, they sent the captured officers to Yongnian. At that time, the company's cadres discussed that many soldiers were from Ci County, and it was estimated that some soldiers would desert, so they decided to have the soldiers investigate the local mobilization and return to the team on the way, so as to carry out education. The troops were stationed in Nankai, Nanle, just in time for the district to hold a mobilization and return meeting. The village cadres said: "The soldiers who run back must return to the team." Stationed in Jiahai Village, the soldier Lin Huoyuan asked an old man: "Are there any recruits in your village?" The old man replied: "Three or four." He asked again: "Did anyone run back?" The old man said: "Let him fight old Chiang, what's the point of running back!" On the way, they met ten or so deserters being sent back to the troops. The instructor gave a speech to everyone at that time, explaining that deserters had to return to the team. After such education, the prisoners were sent back without a single deserter.
    From the one-month-plus bookless education of the company, two points can be proved: First, the current situation of Chiang's bandits cruelly harming the people in the border areas and guerrilla areas, and the situation of our liberated areas supporting the front line, are very good living teaching materials. As long as the company's leaders consciously and organizedly mobilize the soldiers to investigate the situation of the masses based on the ideological situation of the company, and the instructor collects and summarizes the materials and seizes the education, it is possible to improve the class consciousness of the troops. Experience has proved that the company stopped troop desertions due to timely reality education around consolidating the troops. Second, education can be carried out in the operational marching environment. It is wrong to use the excuse of a tense environment, no teaching materials, and no access to newspapers to not carry out education.

### 冀鲁豫某部在作战行军中　随时进行现实教育　提高战士觉悟巩固部队

　　冀鲁豫某部在作战行军中
  　随时进行现实教育
  　提高战士觉悟巩固部队
    冀鲁豫军区部队某连，六、七月份，在豫北保卫麦收，及掩护修黄堤等作战行军环境中，及时进行了现实教育，对于巩固部队，起了很大作用。下面是他们进行的情形：在豫北封邱、延津一带保卫麦收时，经常追击敌人，天气热，生活苦，大家情绪有些不高。指导员让大家调查群众生活情形，在新安店，战士调查出一个老百姓因为说八路军好，全家五口人被王匪三祝活埋了，匪王三祝逼着老百姓到处要饭。指导员将以上材料以讲话方式上了三课，班里讨论了一次，战士们说：“王三祝真不叫人活啦！非跟他干一火不可。”几次遭遇战斗，一连战士都要求好好干一场。
    开封打下来后，城里人象赶会似的往解放区来。一连干部商量，这是个教育战士的好机会，于是上午发动战士在公路边问问出来的人，打开封是啥样。战士询问中，有的说：“八路军炮真厉害，一炮打掉一个炮楼。”有的说：“八路军太好啦！出布告光捉刘茂恩，其他不拿枪都没有事。”逃亡地主说：“回家分地，过好日子。”一连司务长的同乡，怕动员参军，跑到开封去，头上被炸伤了，这次也跑回来。从监狱被解放出来的人，见了咱们特别亲热。战士们经过这次调查后，都纷纷的说：“开封打开，放出这样多‘宣传员’，听他们说后，我看蒋介石到不了三年就完蛋了。”有的说：“这个时候开小差，才真是傻瓜哩！”
    保卫麦收后，到黄河南岸掩护修大堤，刚驻到桑村集，遭敌机轰炸，五架飞机将集上炸的一场糊涂，有的小贩被炸死了，两个复员军人也炸伤了，一连虽未炸着，却有的因而害怕蒋机，不愿到河南去掩护修堤。指导员根据此情况上课，说蒋介石消灭不了，谁也过不了安生日子，你们看复员的同志被炸着后说：“还得到前方去与蒋介石干。”课后战士石富说：“这一讲跟午睡起来凉水洗了洗脸一样（意即清醒了），不消灭蒋介石过不了好日子。”
    到河南掩护群众修高村险工时，他们听说最近几天来被飞机打伤了一百一十多名民工，向战士又作了临时教育，恨的战士们说：“中国怎么出了个蒋介石这杂种，闹的老百姓多苦吧！”
    掩护修堤任务结束后，送俘虏军官到永年去，当时连的干部商量，很多战士是磁县的，估计会有战士逃亡，因而决定在路上让战士调查地方动员归队情形，以便进行教育，部队驻南乐南开，恰巧小区开动员归队会，村干们说：“跑回的战士都得归队。”驻在贾海村，战士林霍元问一个老乡：“你们这村有参军的没有？”答：“三四个”。又问：“跑回来了没有？”老乡说：“叫他打老蒋哩，跑回来干啥！”在路上又碰见十来个逃亡战士往部队送，指导员当时即向大家讲了话，说明逃亡还得归队，经过这样教育，将俘虏送到又回来，没有一个逃亡的。
    从一连一个多月来的没书本的教育中，可以证明两点：第一、目前在边缘区、游击区蒋匪惨害人民情形，与我们解放区人民支援前线情形，是一个很好的活教材，只要连的领导者，根据连队思想情况，有意识的，有组织的，发动战士调查群众情形，指导员收集总结材料，抓紧教育，是可以提高部队阶级觉悟的。经验证明，一连由于及时围绕着巩固部队进行现实教育，停止了部队逃亡。第二、在作战行军环境中，是可以进行教育的，借口环境紧张，没有教材，看不到报纸，不进行教育，是不对的。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（冀鲁豫电）
