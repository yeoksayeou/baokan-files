Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources indicate that the so-called European Economic Cooperation Committee, comprised of nations participating in the "Marshall Plan," has, after a month of incessant wrangling, still failed to reach an agreement on the allocation of $500 million in loans for the first six months of the "Marshall Plan." Although the plan has been in effect for five months, no loan agreements have been concluded with any country other than Iceland, which signed a $2 million loan agreement. The main point of contention is the US insistence on increasing the allocation ratio for the Western German occupied zones, which other participating countries in the "Marshall Plan" oppose. Another reason for the delay is the harshness of the US loan conditions, because according to US regulations, the dollar portion of the "Marshall Plan" that is "granted" cannot be used to purchase machinery. Only the loan portion, which comes with a high interest rate of 3 percent, can be used to purchase machinery, and the total value of machinery purchased cannot exceed one percent of the total loan amount.

　　美国贷款条件苛刻
  　马歇尔计划执行五个月
  　只订成了一个贷款协定
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：由参加“马歇尔计划”国家组成的所谓欧洲经济合作委员会，经过一个月来无休止的争吵，迄今对实行“马歇尔计划”头六个月中五亿美元贷款的分配问题，仍未获得协议。虽然该计划已执行五个月，但迄今除冰岛签订了二百万美元的贷款协定外，其他国家的贷款协定一个也没有订立。主要的争执点为美国坚持增加西德联合占领区的分配比例，而其他参加“马歇尔计划”的国家则反对这一要求。另一延迟的原因是美国贷款条件的苛刻，因为根据美国的规定，“马歇尔计划”项下“赠予”部分的美元，不能用以购买机器，只有以付出百分之三高利息得来的借款部分，才能购买机器，而购买机器的总值亦不能超过贷款总数的百分之一。
