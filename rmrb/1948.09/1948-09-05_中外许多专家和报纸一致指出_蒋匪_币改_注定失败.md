Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Chinese and foreign parties continue to comment on the Kuomintang government's "currency system reform," unanimously pointing out that its future is destined to fail. According to a TASS dispatch from Prague on the 25th, citing a Reuter's correspondent in Hong Kong: "Hong Kong financial experts generally believe that the Chinese currency will not be stable, and will not be stable even in the short term before it experiences inflation like the old currency. Chinese manufacturers, businessmen, and speculators are exchanging old currency and even large amounts of foreign currency for new currency, but then hurriedly use the new currency to purchase goods. This situation will inevitably lead to an increase in the prices of bulk commodities, which is what the "currency reform" originally wanted to avoid. The ministers of the Chiang government have no confidence in the future and are transferring large amounts of funds to the United States and Hong Kong." In reports sent to Nanjing by the Kuomintang Central News Agency's correspondent in the United States, many American newspapers' views on Chiang Kai-shek's "currency reform" were also mentioned. Even the Wall Street's New York Journal of Commerce published an editorial on the 26th, pointing out: "In fact, China's currency reform is destined to fail." "There is still no indication that the government can correct the financial situation that first caused the rampant depreciation of the legal tender." A Washington Post editorial on the 27th stated: "Currency reform is destined to fail while the civil war continues," and sarcastically said: "The implementation of this 'currency reform' may be a plea to the 'gods' of the United States." An American "government economist" said: "Currency reform can only succeed when military spending stops." Therefore, "even if sufficient reserves are set aside to support the gold yuan, if the budget deficit and trade deficit continue to exist, it will inevitably be depleted." Brown, a columnist for the Washington Star, also believes: "The gold yuan cannot solve the runaway inflation." The newspaper's editorial on the 26th further pointed out: "The stability of Chinese currency cannot be achieved by government actions." The Los Angeles Times also published an editorial on August 22nd entitled "China's New Currency Has Little Prospect," pointing out that "the so-called gold yuan new currency order" will not "transform the economic situation from chaos to order." Arnold, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, believes: "The reform is just scratching off a few zeros from the old currency numbers" (Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 29th).

According to various news reports, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to rise. In Shanghai markets, although they are "full of uniformed police and plainclothes (secret agents) monitoring prices" (United Press), according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th: "All commodities have violated the government's decree to freeze prices at the level of August 19th, with prices increasing by 20 to 40 percent." On that day, at the Seymour Road market in Shanghai, "no amount of money could buy pork. The pork merchants in the area were all arrested on the 24th for violating the price limit frozen at the August 19th level." (Associated Press) According to an Associated Press reporter's dispatch from Peiping on the 29th, "Despite the police and threats, prices in the area are still far above the fixed prices of August 19th. Many commodities have considerable increases. For example, locally made butter has doubled in price, flour has more than doubled in price, and general commodities have generally increased by 25 percent." In Xi'an, a Central News Agency message on the 30th admitted: "Some prices are struggling to rise, especially sporadic foods such as green vegetables and meat, with increases of up to 100%." The Kuomintang authorities have arrested merchants and vendors in the area for days, using violence to suppress prices, resulting in "some stores holding back inventory, causing a shortage of goods in the market and creating a situation where there are goods but no market" (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th). United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 25th believes that "the government's order to freeze prices on August 19th has been met with resistance in food markets, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, and retail stores in cities such as Shanghai, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Hankou, Chengdu, Tianjin, and Changsha." "In many cities, black market transactions are growing again."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. According to a Moscow broadcast on August 25th, Masinu commented on the Kuomintang government's "currency system reform" and pointed out: In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of China, the currency system reform has been followed by another round of price increases. On the first day after the currency system reform in Shanghai, the prices of rice, oil, flour, and coal increased by 10 percent. In Guangzhou, prices generally increased by an average of 50 percent. In Chongqing, the prices of many items increased by 30 to 50 percent. Although the "decree" restricts prices to the level of August 19th, the soaring prices have not stopped. Masinu emphasized: "This fact clearly proves that the Kuomintang's currency system reform measures not only cannot stop the economic crisis but also cannot stop its development."

　　中外许多专家和报纸一致指出
  　蒋匪“币改”注定失败
    【新华社陕北二日电】中外各方续评国民党政府的“币制改革”，一致指出其前途注定要失败。据塔斯社布拉格二十五日电引电通社香港访员报导：“香港财政专家咸信中国货币不会稳定，甚至在它如旧币一样发生通货膨胀以前的短期内都不会有稳定。中国制造家、商人与投机家，虽以旧币甚至大量外币来换取新币，但随即又匆忙以新币购买货物。这种情形将不可避免地造成大宗商品价格的上涨，而这种上涨却原是“币改”所想要避免的。蒋政府各部长都对前途没有信心，而将大量的资金输往美国与香港”。在国民党中央社驻美国记者连日发往南京的通报中，也提及许多美国报纸对蒋介石“币改”的看法。甚至华尔街的纽约商务日报亦于二十六日发表社论，指出：“事实上，中国货币改革是注定要失败的”。“现在尚无任何迹象可以证明政府能够矫正曾首先造成法币狂贬的财经情势”。华盛顿邮报二十七日社论称：“货币改革在内战继续进行时是注定要失败的”，并讽刺说：“这一‘币改’的实施，可能是向美国的‘神仙’求拜”。而一位美国“政府经济学家”则称：“币改显然只有在军费开支停止时才能成功”。因此，“即令把足够的准备金放在一边支持金圆，如果预算赤字与贸易入超继续存在，这也必定会消耗掉”。华盛顿明星报专栏作家布朗亦认为：“金圆券不可能解决狂奔不已的通货膨胀”。该报二十六日的社论又指出：“中国货币的稳定，非政府的行为所能达到。”美国洛杉矶时报亦于八月二十二日发表题为“中国新币前途不大”的社论，指出：“所谓金圆新币之命令”，不会使“经济局势由混乱而变成有秩序”。上海英国商会会长亚诺德认为：“改革只是将旧币数字划去几个零”（美联社二十九日上海电）。
    另据各方消息报导，国民党统治区各地物价继续上涨。上海各市场，虽然“布满身着制服之警察与便衣（特务）监视物价”（合众社），但据法新社二十六日上海消息：“一切商品都违背了政府冻结物价在八月十九日水准的法令，涨价百分之二十至四十”。该日，上海西摩路市场，“无论出什么价钱，都买不到猪肉。该地的猪肉商二十四日曾因违反冻结于八月十九日水平的限价而全部被捕。”（美联社）另据美联社记者二十九日自北平报导“尽管有警察和威胁，该地区的物价仍然远远超过八月十九日的限定价格。许多商品都有可观的上涨。例如当地制造的牛油涨价一倍，面粉涨价一倍多，一般商品普遍涨价百分之二十五。”在西安，中央社三十日消息承认：“部分物价挣扎上升，尤以零星食品青菜肉类等为最多，上涨一倍。”国民党当局连日在该地逮捕商人、小贩，用暴力压抑物价的结果，“若干商店存货不售，致使市场货缺，造成有行无市的现象”（中央社二十九日电）。合众社上海二十五日电认为：“政府冻结八月十九日物价的命令，已在上海、徐州、西安、汉口、成都、天津、长沙等城市的食品市场、旅馆、饭店、澡堂和零售店中碰壁”。“许多城市中，黑市交易又在滋长”。
    【新华社陕北二日电】据莫斯科八月二十五日广播，马西努评论国民党政府“币制改革”时指出：在中国国民党统治区内，随着币制改革而来的是再一次的物价高涨。在上海当币制改革后的第一天，米、油、面、煤的价格就增涨了百分之十。在广州，物价一般的平均涨了百分之五十。在重庆，有许多物品的价格增高了百分之三十至五十。虽然“法令”上限制物价于八月十九日的水平，可是物价的飞涨并未停止。马西努着重指出：“这种事实极明显的证明：国民党币制改革的措施，不仅不能停止经济危机，并且不能停止它的发展。”
