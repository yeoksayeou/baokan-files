　　Conscientiously Cultivating Land Well for Military Dependents
　　Shexian County's Xuanzhong Inspects Substitute Farming
　　[Taihang News] The Xuanzhong Production Committee of Shexian County, upon hearing reports from military dependents that this year's substitute farming was not being done well, immediately convened a meeting of all cadres to study improvement methods. Everyone unanimously agreed that a committee for inspecting substitute farming should be formed jointly by cadres and the masses, and they began to conduct door-to-door inspections the next day. There were a total of 23 military dependents' households in the village, with 143 households of the masses responsible for cultivating 88 mu of irrigated land and 32 mu of dry land. This year, 2.5 mu of irrigated land and 1.9 mu of dry land were left uncultivated. Chen Yanqing was cultivating a piece of dry land five li away for Zhang Naiyuan. In the past, the crops on this piece of land never grew well, but this year they are growing very well. Whatever work he does, he always does it for the military dependents first. The land he cultivates has already been weeded twice, and he plans to weed it a third time. The land that Li Zhengfang cultivated for Tian Qiyuan has already been weeded three times. Chen Yanqing, Li Zhengfang, and thirteen others were selected as models of substitute farming in this inspection, and they were commended at mass meetings, on the public blackboard, and on the radio station. Bad practices are to be criticized and educated. Yang Xiangyuan was cultivating 3.8 mu of irrigated land for Li Ting, but he had only weeded it once, the weeds were not killed, and no fertilizer had been applied. He received severe criticism. After the inspection, three conditions for substitute farming for military dependents were stipulated: 1. If cultivation is neglected or delayed, resulting in a failure to plant, compensation will be paid appropriately based on the average yield. 2. If weeding is neglected, and military dependents are forced to hire others to do the weeding, the substitute farmer should be criticized and compensate for wage losses. 3. For those who generally do less or cultivate poorly, public criticism and education will be conducted at mass meetings. Then, a forum for military dependents was held to ask them what difficulties they had. Everyone unanimously said: "It won't be bad to have such frequent inspections! If you do this, it doesn't matter if there are any difficulties later." The military dependents were very satisfied. (Liu Quanxun)

　　认真给军属把地种好
  　涉县悬钟检查代耕
    【太行讯】涉县悬钟生产委员会听到军属反映今年的地代耕得不好，立即召开全体干部研究改进办法。大家一致同意由干部和群众共同组成检查代耕委员会，第二天即挨户检查。全村共有军属廿三户，由一四三户群众负责代耕水地八十八亩，旱地三十二亩。今年荒了水地二亩五分，旱地一亩九分。陈彦清给张乃元代耕着一块有五里远的旱地，以往这块地庄稼总长不好，今年长的很好。他做啥活也是先给军属做，他代耕的地已经锄过两遍，还计划锄三遍。李正方给田其元代耕的地已锄过三遍。陈彦清、李正方等十三人在这次检查中被选为代耕模范，在群众会上、大众黑板和广播台受到表扬。坏的要批评教育。杨香元给李廷代耕着三亩八分水地，只锄了一遍，草都没锄死，粪也没有上，他受了严重的批评。检查以后，规定出给军属代耕条件三种：一、该种不种、耽误种地的按平均产量适当包赔损失。二、该锄不锄、军属被迫找了别人去锄的，代耕者应受到批评，并包出工资损失。三、一般做的少、耕种差点的由大会批评教育。接着又召开军属座谈会，问他们有什么困难，大家一致说：“要照这样勤检查，该不是好哩！这样做，就是以后有点困难也没啥”。军属十分满意了。（刘全勋）
