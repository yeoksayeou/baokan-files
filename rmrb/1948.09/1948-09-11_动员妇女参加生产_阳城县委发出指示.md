(Taiyue Telegram) The Yangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production. It first commended the exemplary deeds of women in production during the great participation in the war last year, such as the 65 women in Zujiahe harvesting over 600 mu of crops and planting over 70 mu of wheat, achieving early planting and early harvesting despite the excessive lack of male labor. Another example was the 106 women in Jiangli Village learning to plow and plowing 600 mu of land last autumn. The instructions then pointed out that the erroneous view of underestimating women still widely exists. For example, leadership only organizes women in emergencies during crash campaigns, lacking regular organizational work. Some mothers-in-law and men still oppose women going to the fields. Some women who return from working in the fields also have to cook and endure family grievances, and some can't even afford a hair clip after working for a year, so their enthusiasm is not high. Secondly, in organizing women's production, the phenomenon of coercion and unequal value is common. Some mutual aid teams' accounts have not been settled to this day, causing some groups to disband, and some exist only in name. In addition, the leadership's bad work style of only focusing on form and not content has led to serious spontaneous flow. Therefore, the following guidelines for organizing women's production are determined: (1) Resolutely implement the principle of voluntary and equal value, change the style of coercion, restore and rectify women's mutual aid organizations, clear old wages, implement work points based on labor, work hours based on people, and settle accounts in a timely manner. Pay attention to cultivating leading backbones to gradually form a mutual aid core. (2) Implement a 20/80 profit-sharing system (women get 20% of their labor income, and the family gets 80%). On the one hand, educate women that they eat and dress at home and should not have excessive demands. On the other hand, persuade families that women's participation in labor increases family wealth, and giving them some share can encourage them to be more active in production. (3) In terms of organizational forms, be flexible according to customs and seasons, and do not be confined to one form. It should be convenient for women to participate in production. (4) Don't neglect sideline production because of organizing women to participate in agricultural production. In sideline production, leadership should be strengthened to organize labor exchange. For example, in spinning, weaving, and raising silkworms, efforts should be made to ensure everyone does their best, learns from each other's strengths, and compensates for weaknesses, with equal exchange and no one suffering losses. Do not force weak and small-footed women to work in the fields, so as not to harm women's health. At the same time, pay attention to combining education to meet women's literacy needs. According to the principle of "learn what you do," use "little teachers" to teach women to read, read newspapers, and improve women's political awareness and culture.

　　动员妇女参加生产
  　阳城县委发出指示
    【太岳电】中共阳城县委最近发出关于组织动员妇女参加生产的指示。首先表扬了去年大参战时菹家河六十五个妇女收割六百多亩庄稼，种了七十多亩麦子，在男劳力过分缺乏的情况下，做到了早种早收；匠礼村一百零六个妇女学会犁地，去秋犁地六百亩等妇女生产模范事迹。继即指出：轻视妇女的错误观点仍普遍存在，如领导上只是在紧急时，突击组织一下，缺乏经常的组织工作。有些翁婆与男人还反对妇女下地，有些妇女上地劳动回来，又做饭、又受家庭的气，还有的劳动一年连一个头发卡子也买不上，因此情绪不高。其次在组织妇女生产时，强迫命令，不自愿，不等价的现象是普遍的，有些互助组的帐至今还没算清，闹的有些组散伙了，有些是有名无实。再加领导上只讲形式，不看内容的坏作风，形成了严重的自流。因此确定今后组织妇女生产的方针：（一）坚决贯彻自愿等价原则，改变强迫命令的作风，恢复整顿妇女互助组织，清理旧工资，实行按活记分，按人记工，及时结帐。注意培养领导骨干，使逐渐形成互助核心。（二）实行二八分红制（妇女劳动所得工资，自己得二成，家庭得八成），一方面教育妇女：吃在家，穿在家，要求不能过高。一方面说服家庭：妇女参加劳动是增加家庭财富，分给一些，能鼓励她们更积极生产。（三）在组织形式上，要根据习惯和季节，灵活组织，不应拘于一种形式。要便于妇女参加生产。（四）不能因组织妇女参加农业生产，就忽视了副业生产。在副业上、应加强领导，组织变工。如纺织，养蚕，要做到各尽所能，取长补短，等价交换，互不吃亏。不能勉强体弱脚小的妇女下地劳动，以免损害妇女健康。同时注意结合教育，满足妇女识字要求。根据“做啥学啥”的原则，利用“小先生”教妇女识字，读报，提高妇女政治和文化。
