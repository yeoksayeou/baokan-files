　　Railway Guards Should Not Bully the People
To the Editors:
    On August 26th, I took the evening train from Yangquan to Shijiazhuang. There were five people in military uniform (claiming to be from the Niangziguan section of the Railway Bureau's guard team) who occupied six seats. When an old fellow villager wanted to sit down, they refused, saying, "There's one more person coming." When the tickets were checked, it was proven that there were only five of them (free tickets). At this time, the old fellow villager said, "Weren't you six people! Why are there only five now?" The people in military uniform didn't want to listen to the old fellow villager questioning them like this, and the two sides started arguing. The old fellow villager said, "You're wearing public clothes and disgracing the country! Why are five people occupying six seats?" At this point, several people in military uniform wanted to tie up the old fellow villager, but the ticket inspector pulled them apart. After the train arrived at Niangziguan and stopped, the people in military uniform wanted to pull the old fellow villager off the train. The old fellow villager struggled and refused to get off, and one person in military uniform said, "You said we are disgracing the country, that is sabotage." They finally pulled the old fellow villager off the train.
    This incident had a very bad impact on the passengers on the train. I hope the Railway Bureau will thoroughly investigate and publish the results in the newspaper.

　　铁路警卫队员不该欺压群众编辑同志：
    我于八月二十六日由阳泉坐晚车到石家庄，同车有五个穿军衣的（自称是铁路局娘子关段警卫队）占了六个人的坐位。有一个老乡要坐，他们不让，说：“还有一个人。”等到查票的时候，证明他们只有五个人（免票）。此时老乡说：“你们不是六个人吗！现在为什么只有五个人呢？”穿军衣的不愿听老乡这样质问，双方便吵起来。老乡说：“你们穿着公家的衣服，替国家丢人呢！为什么五个人占六个人的坐位？”此时几个穿军衣的要捆这个老乡，被查票的说解拉开了。车开到娘子关停住后，穿军衣的要把老乡拉下车去，老乡挣扎着不下，一位穿军衣的说：“你说我们替国家丢人，就是破坏分子。”终把老乡拉下了车。
    这件事情给车上客人的影响很坏，我希望铁路局彻查，并在报纸上公布。
