　　Frost Prevention Methods
    [Taihang Telegram] The Limit of Heat has passed, and White Dew is approaching. Crops will soon be ripe. In the past, counties like Heshun and Xiyang in the Taihang Second District often suffered from frost disasters in autumn, leading to reduced harvests. Considering the early cold this year, in order to protect the autumn crops and avoid the damage of frost disasters, the local Xinhua News here introduces the following frost prevention methods: The first step in prevention is to be able to observe the conditions under which frost is most likely to occur, so as to be able to prevent it effectively. Generally speaking, if the sky is clear blue during the day, it will definitely frost at night. If the sky has some bluish-gray color, it will also frost at night. If the sky is more gray than blue (gray-blue), the possibility of frost is smaller. If the sky is entirely gray, there will definitely be no frost at night, because if the day is clear blue with no clouds at all, it is as if a quilt has been removed from the ground, and the climate will be particularly cold at night, making it easy to frost. The specific methods to overcome frost disasters are: (1) Smudging: Burn firewood in small piles in the fields, the more widespread the burning, the better, and the more smoke, the better. Be careful not to make the piles too large, causing flames. If there are flames, the smoke should be reduced. This method has been used in some places with great success. Because crops are generally most afraid of sudden cold during growth, if the ground is smudged with smoke, the layer of smoke can reduce heat dissipation, so that the air temperature will not drop quickly, and the crops will not be harmed in this less cold air. For burning, you can use ordinary dry firewood, such as cypress branches. Where firewood is scarce, it can be combined with late autumn fertilizer application, and the ashes can also be used as fertilizer. (2) Set up bonfire platforms. In the wild, especially in areas prone to frost, set up several bonfire platforms, each with five or six bundles of firewood. Establish necessary frost prevention organizations, adopt village-to-village joint prevention methods, and stipulate certain signals, such as setting off firecrackers or lighting fires, dispatching frost prevention watchmen. If it is discovered that frost is about to fall or has already begun to fall, quickly light the fires or set off firecrackers, and light fires everywhere at the same time, which can overcome frost disasters and save the autumn grain that is about to be harvested. Last year, Heshun, Xiyang and other counties used these methods to save tens of thousands of acres of autumn crops, with great results.

　　防霜办法
    【太行电】处暑已过，白露来临庄稼就要成熟，太行二分区和顺、昔阳等县过去每年秋天常常受到霜灾的危害以致收成减少，加以今年早寒，为保护秋禾，避免霜灾的损害，此间新华报特介绍防霜办法如下：预防办法首先要会观察在什么情况下最容易下霜，才好预防。一般的说，如果白天是青天一色，夜间必定下霜。如天空带些青灰色，夜里也会下霜，天突灰色重青色轻（灰青色）下霜的可能就小了，要是天空全是灰色，夜间决不会有霜，因为白天是青天一色，没有一点云彩，就如同地上去了一层被子一样，到夜间气候就会特别冷，容易下霜。战胜霜灾的具体办法是：（一）薰烟法：用柴火在地里分成很多小堆焚烧，烧的柴堆越普遍越好，冒烟越多越好。注意不要使柴堆大了，冒起火头，一有火头烟就要减少。这种办法有些地方已经用过，收效很大。因为一般庄稼在生长时候最怕突然转冷，如果地里用烟薰薰，地面盖一层烟，能减少热力的发散，使气温不会很快的降低，庄稼也就在这不大冷的空气中，不会受害了。烧火用的柴，可用一般的干柴，如柏枝等。缺柴的地方可与晚秋薰肥结合，烧后还可顶肥料用。（二）设焚火台。在野外，尤其是容易降霜的地区，设立若干焚火台，每台可准备柴火五六担，设必要的防霜组织，采用村与村的联防办法，并规定一定的记号，如响炮点火等，派遣防霜了望哨，发现快要落霜或已开始降落，就赶快点火或响炮，四处一齐点火，即可战胜霜灾，挽救快要吃到嘴边的秋粮禾。去年和顺昔阳等县用这些办法，救秋禾数万亩，收效极大。
