　　【Jinan Telegram】Since the implementation of correct industrial and commercial policies, Handan City has seen an increase in July of twenty-seven industrial businesses, including the cigarette, workshop, iron, and cotton weaving industries, and fifty-four commercial businesses, including general merchandise, warehouses, coal, traditional Chinese medicine, oil, and cotton industries. The pharmaceutical industry has seen particularly significant development. Before the War of Resistance, the city had only six pharmacies, with only one or two engaging in wholesale, and the rest being small retail drugstores. During the enemy's occupation, although five or six pharmacies were added, there were no trading houses. Since liberation, especially after the implementation of correct industrial and commercial policies this year, the pharmaceutical industry has developed greatly. Now, there are forty-six pharmaceutical businesses in the city, twenty-one of which are pharmaceutical trading houses. In June, the city's average daily transaction volume of medicinal materials exceeded 20,000 catties. Qingsheng Pharmacy, which started operating last year with only seven people and a capital of two million, has seen its capital grow to 52 million this year. From February to April, it gained a net profit of 17.5 million. The number of staff has also increased to forty-two. Since appropriately resolving the wage issue, Jisheng Pharmaceutical Trading House has greatly improved the workers' enthusiasm for production, increasing output by one-third in a month compared to the original output. Previously, each worker only cut an average of fifteen catties of medicine per day, but now they cut an average of twenty-two catties per day, and the quality has also improved. To encourage everyone's enthusiasm for production, the factory voluntarily bought towels, soap, and tea for the workers as rewards. The workers also respect the factory a lot. Every time they cut medicine, they first cut some for the factory to inspect the fineness before cutting the rest. They pay attention to saving when cutting medicine, and no matter how difficult it is, they always try to cut all the broken and loose medicine. The city's merchants have doubled their enthusiasm for business.

　　邯郸药材等业增加
    【冀南电】自端正工商业政策后，七月份邯郸市增加卷烟业、作坊业、铁工业、棉织业等工业廿七家，杂货业、货栈业、煤炭业、中药业、油业、棉业等商业五十四家。药材业更有显著发展。该市抗战前只有六家药店，除一、二家批发外，其余都是些零售小药铺。在敌人统治时，药材业虽增加了五、六家，但没有行栈。自解放后，特别是今年端正了工商业政策后，药材业有了很大发展。现在全市共有药业四十六家，其中有廿一家是药材行栈。六月份全市每天平均成交药材两万多斤。庆生药行去年开始经营时只七个人，二百万资金，今年资金已发展到五千二百万元，二月到四月，共得纯利一千七百五十万元。柜上人员也添到四十二人。济生药材行自从适当解决了工资问题后，大大提高了工人生产情绪，一个月内比原先产量增加三分之一。以前平均每个工人一天只切十五斤药，现在每天平均切二十二斤，在质量上也提高了。厂方为了鼓励大家生产情绪，自动给工人买毛巾、肥皂、茶叶作为奖励，工人对厂方也很尊重，每次切药时，先切出一些叫厂方检验粗细，然后再切。切药时注意节约，所有碎药零药不管怎样费劲，也总要切到里边去。该市商人经营情绪加倍提高。
