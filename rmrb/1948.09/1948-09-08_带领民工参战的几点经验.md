　　In the inner-line plain siege and assault operations, the battle time is relatively long. The task of the stretcher-bearer civilians is to assist the troops in combat through a four-in-one action: carrying the wounded, digging fortifications, transporting earthwork tools, and delivering ammunition. Wherever the troops move, the civilians also move, living a combat life similar to that of the soldiers, but also decentralized. Therefore, if the civilians can be well organized and educated, it is of great importance to winning the war. In the long-distance participation in the war, the Taihang civilians carried out a "three evaluations" (evaluating cadres, evaluating themselves, evaluating others) and "four records" (recording completed tasks, recording mutual assistance, recording performance, recording discipline) movement. During the movement, each brigade continuously carried out ideological mobilization, organizational adjustments, and disciplinary rectification, improved organizational leadership, and improved the relationship between cadres and members. Because this movement combined improving the political consciousness of the masses (ideological transformation), improving leadership, strengthening organizational discipline, and improving military knowledge (including tactical improvement), the appearance of the civilians was completely renewed, and the efficiency of completing tasks was generally improved: two people's tasks were completed by one person, one night's task was completed in half a night, and the fact that minor injuries did not leave the front line appeared everywhere. The original regulation of five people per stretcher was later changed to four, three, and two people per stretcher. Each squad went from two stretchers to four. After the emergency order was issued, each team automatically organized stretcher assault teams to go to the front line with the troops to complete the task, highly demonstrating the people's enthusiasm for supporting the war. What are the main experiences in this?

    Mobilization Equipment and Solving Production Problems

    The mobilization work in the village before departure is the basic work to consolidate the civilian laborers. Any deceitful methods or failure to mobilize in depth, and an attitude of not seriously solving problems, is a lack of responsibility and is detrimental to the war. This time in the Jinzhong participation in the war, a combination of top-down mobilization and bottom-up guarantees was adopted, and the mobilization meeting was conducted through various systems, with party members taking the lead in promoting participation in the war. The village cadres and masses who stayed at home proposed to guarantee the production in the rear, so that the front and rear encouraged each other and dispelled the concerns of the participating civilians about production. Facts have proved that where the mobilization is more thorough and the problem of production participation and labor exchange is well resolved, the civilians there are consolidated. Conversely, although mobilization is constantly carried out during the expedition, the leadership is always forced to be in a passive position.

    The participating civilians must be fully prepared in terms of equipment. For example, each company must have three large pots, one splitting axe, one saw, water buckets, knives, spoons and other utensils; each stretcher must also have a shovel, a pickaxe, and ropes, as well as personal shoes, etc., which are necessary for completing battlefield tasks.

    To solve the rear production of the participating civilians, a fair burden-sharing and unified mutual assistance method was adopted. Each participating labor force was recorded as eight points per day (because they ate public grain), and one day was counted as one day, and the land was shared by the remaining labor force for mutual assistance. Mutual assistance was recorded according to the actual labor, and the accounts were settled uniformly after returning, to ensure that no one suffered losses. When the rear labor force is too scarce, women can be strongly mobilized to participate in production. In the district and village leadership, a unified plan and division of labor were adopted. Village-level production committees were used to promote it. A special person was assigned among the village cadres to arrange the lives of the participating civilians.

    Establish Democratic Leadership and Develop Military Democracy

    The civilian laborers are peasants who have undergone land reform and production movements. Some of them have undergone several major war participations, and some are militiamen and Communist Party members who have received political training and war education. They have a fairly high political consciousness and competitive spirit. They generally demand that their achievements be known to the masses in their villages and their families, and to the higher authorities. This is the political basis for realizing democratic leadership and developing military democracy. The movement began with the launch of the three evaluations, four records, and merit-making movement. An important item in the three evaluations is to examine the leadership and style of the cadres. At the beginning, the leaders gave the members courage and boldness, guaranteeing no retaliation, and letting the members boldly expose the problems of the leaders. It was found that some team leaders had inconsistent commands; some cadres could not understand the situation in time to explain to the members, reducing fear; some cadres beat people, lived a special life, and some were afraid of death or had tailism representing backward opinions and destructive disciplinary phenomena. After examination and discussion, the opinions of the masses were concentrated, the cadres were transformed, and the leadership was strengthened. The good platoon leaders recognized by the masses were promoted to company commanders. In the democratic movement, it is necessary to correct two deviations in a timely manner: one is that some cadres are afraid of democracy and afraid of criticism, thinking that this will make it impossible to lead, that military affairs cannot be democratic, and that democracy cannot implement orders; the other is that the members find fault with the cadres, nitpicking, and extreme democracy. For example, hiding during air raids was also considered a bad attitude. The leadership carried out correct democratic education based on the specific situation and the correct opinions of the masses, promoted the correct democratic style, and overcame commandism and tailism.

    The other two contents of the three evaluations are evaluating oneself and evaluating others. This is examined from the perspective of completing tasks and obeying leadership. Some members said: "The cadres force us to hide from the planes for our own good, how can we say they are wrong?" The leadership promoted this consciousness of everyone and strengthened the members' organization and discipline, so that the movement shifted from striving for individual models to striving for collective models, so the work effect was increased to 100% to 300%. For example, when transporting door panels, one team could transport 300 pieces overnight at the beginning, but at this time, 600 pieces could be transported in the middle of the night.

    In the evaluation and recording, it is necessary to grasp the evaluation and recording standards and the principle of criticism and self-criticism: that is, being able to complete tasks, abide by discipline, and help each other (including caring for the wounded, not saying strange things, and not complaining about fatigue, etc.). These standards themselves combine commendation and merit-making with criticism, which is different from the past's pure commendation, only saying good things and not saying bad things, but evaluating good and bad merits and demerits together to promote mutual progress. Coupled with the leadership's self-reporting and public discussion, the correctness of the evaluation and recording is further guaranteed.

    For heavy work such as transporting equipment, it is necessary to add evaluation of strength and weight, otherwise, if only evaluated from the numbers, some people have great strength and carry more, and those with less strength will not be praised even if they do their best, which will weaken their energy.

    The evaluation and recording method should be that each squad leader accepts each person's work report and opinions every day or after a task is completed, laying the foundation for the overall evaluation. The results of the evaluation and recording must be submitted to the company or brigade for review and approval. If there are any inappropriate ones, a re-evaluation will be proposed, even repeated evaluations. At the conclusion of the movement, all the good and bad merits and demerits evaluated in each section are added up (good and bad cannot be offset) for a final evaluation. In addition to awarding the model workers, everyone's merits should be brought back. For erroneous behaviors such as desertion, it must also be filled in and brought back. If one has a new understanding of one's shortcomings after democratic discussion, it can be omitted. This is of great educational significance.

    Several Issues in the Political Work of Civilian Laborers

    First, to make the members change from cowardly to brave, the cadres must take the lead in supporting and encouraging them and commanding calmly. The 3rd Company of the 6th Brigade had to transport rails to the artillery position, and they had to pass through an open area. The deputy battalion commander and the deputy company commander first carried one rail over, and other members followed suit under this influence. No one retreated even when bullets hit the rails. In a stretcher activity of a detachment of the 4th Company of the 2nd Brigade, the enemy counterattacked and surrounded from the flanks. The enemy's bombs exploded on the shelter. The members were afraid and wanted to run away. The squad leader Yuan Shisheng judged the situation and immediately explained to everyone: "The troops are still in front, they will eliminate the enemy on our position, don't move around, listen to the command!" The members were not confused, and there were no casualties. Secondly, on-the-spot military knowledge education should be carried out on the battlefield. When the 2nd Brigade in Changzhi discovered enemy aircraft, it conducted air defense education to enable members to identify bombers, fighters, and transport aircraft, and told them the characteristics of various aircraft and how to avoid them, and how to move beyond the danger zone. With military knowledge, the members gradually freed themselves from fear. The third is to improve political awareness. Combine the evaluation of casualties to oppose fear of death. When the × Company of the 2nd Brigade evaluated the casualties, they found the cause of the casualties: they did not know to disperse when the shells came, and many people squeezed around, not listening to the command. After repeated discussions, it got better later.

    Second, on the issue of consciously abiding by battlefield discipline, mass discipline, and urban discipline. Before the start of the campaign, special discipline and policy education must be carried out to enlighten everyone to cherish the liberated areas and build the political awareness of the liberated areas. In action, discipline inspection must be organized. Those who perform well should be commended and encouraged, and those who violate policies and disciplines should be criticized and corrected. Those who conceal violations of policies and disciplines and those who do not change after education should be given disciplinary sanctions. Some people do not report when they see violations of discipline, or they do not care when they see enemy-abandoned machine guns. This is a liberal attitude of not cherishing revolutionary weapons and should be educated and corrected in a timely manner.

    Third, the issue of setting up branches among the participating civilians to strengthen the leadership of the party. Some places have not paid attention to this work, causing party members to lose leadership and weakening the role of the party. For example, when a certain brigade first selected models, more than 80 people were selected, but only five were party members. After the branch checked, the party members played an active role. When the models were selected for the second time, there were more than 20 party members, accounting for 40% of all party members in the branch. The task of the party branch of the civilian militia company should be to unite and consolidate the civilian militia, ensure the completion of the task, ensure the implementation of discipline, publicize the party's policies, review party members during the participation in the war, educate and transform party members, and become a political work trust. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a unified party organization such as the Party Committee and the General Branch. And strengthen the party's leadership institutions, so that the civilians can exert greater combat effectiveness under the sound unitary leadership.

　　带领民工参战的几点经验
    在内线的平原围城攻坚作战中，战役时间较长。担架民工的任务，由抬伤员到挖工事，运土工作业器材，送弹药，以四位一体的动作协助部队作战。部队运动到哪里，民工也运动到哪里，过着同战士一样的但又是分散的战斗生活。因此民工能组织和教育的好，对争取战争胜利是有极大关系的。太行民工在远征参战中，开展了三评（评干部、评自己、评别人）、四记（记完成任务、记互助、记表现、记纪律）运动。在运动过程中，各大队不断进行思想动员、组织调整和纪律整顿，健全了组织领导，改善了干部与队员的关系。由于这一运动是把提高群众政治觉悟（思想改造）、改进领导、加强组织性纪律性及提高军事常识（战术改进在内）三者结合进行的，因之民工面貌为之一新，完成任务的效率普遍提高：二人任务一人完成，一夜任务半夜完成，轻伤不下火线的事实，到处出现。原来规定五人一付担架，以后变成四人、三人、二人一付。每班由两付而变成四付。紧急命令下达后，各队自动组织担架突击队，与部队一起到前线去完成任务，高度表现出人民对支援战争的热情。在这当中有哪些主要经验呢？
    动员装备及解决生产问题
    出发前在村的动员工作，是巩固民工的基础工作。任何哄骗方式或不深入动员，不认真解决问题的态度，都是缺乏责任心，对战争不利的。此次晋中参战，采取了自上而下的动员与自下而上的保证配合，且经过各系统的动员会，党员带头推动参战。留在家的村干党员与群众，提出保证后方生产，这样前后方互相鼓舞，解除了参战民工对生产的顾虑。事实证明，那里动员比较彻底，对生产参战变工问题解决得好，那里的民工就巩固。反之，虽在出征中不断动员，领导上总是被迫处于被动地位。
    参战民工在装备上，必须有充分准备。如每一个中队要有大锅三口，劈斧一把，锯子一把，水桶、刀、杓子等用具；每付担架又要有一把洋锹，一把洋镐与绳索，以及个人的鞋子等，都是在完成战场任务时必需的。
    解决参战民工后方生产，采取了公平负担，统一助耕的办法。每个参战劳力一天按八分记工（因吃的是公粮），有一天算一天，地由留在家的劳力一负担助耕。助耕按实际劳力记工，回来后统一算帐，保证谁也不吃亏。后方劳力太缺乏时，可以大力动员妇女参加生产。在区村领导上，采取了统一计划，分工负责。运用村级生产委员进行推动。村干部中设专人负责按排参战民工的生活。
    树立民主领导开展军事民主
    民工是经过了土改与生产运动的农民，其中有一部分经过几次较大的参战锻炼，一部分是受过政治训练和战争教育的民兵和共产党员，有相当高的政治觉悟与竞胜心，普遍要求把自己的成绩让自己村群众和家里人知道，让上级知道。这就是实现民主领导和开展军事民主的政治基础。运动开始，是从开展三评四记立功运动搞起的。三评中重要一项，即是检查干部的领导和作风。开始时，领导上即给队员作主壮胆，保证不报复，让队员大胆揭发领导上的问题，检查出有的队领导指挥不一致；有的干部不能及时了解情况，给队员解释，减少恐惧心理，还吓唬民工，越吓唬越骇怕；有的干部打人，生活特殊，有的怕死或有代表落后意见的尾巴主义及破坏纪律现象等。经过检查讨论，集中群众意见，改造干部，加强了领导，群众公认的好排长提拔起来当了连长。民主运动中必须及时纠正两个偏向：一是某些干部怕民主，怕提意见，以为这样便没法领导，要军事即不能民主，要民主就不能执行命令；一是队员对干部没错找错，吹毛求疵，极端民主。如把躲飞机时干部命令隐敝也算作态度不好等。领导上根据具体情况及群众中的正确意见，进行了正确的民主教育，发扬了正确的民主作风，克服了命令主义和尾巴主义。
    三评的另两个内容是评自己，评别人。这是从完成任务与服从领导来检查的。有的队员说：“干部逼住叫咱躲飞机，是为了咱，这还能说人家不对？”领导上发扬了大家的这种自觉性，加强了队员的组织性和纪律性，使运动从争取个人模范转向争取集体模范，因而工作效果提高到百分之一百至三百。例如运门板，开始时一个队一夜运三百块，这时半夜即可运六百块。
    评记中要掌握评记标准及批评与自我批评的原则：即能完成任务，遵守纪律，互助友爱（包括爱护伤员，不说怪话，疲劳不埋怨等）。这些标准的本身，就是表模立功与批评相结合，不同于过去的单纯表功，光说好不说坏，而是好坏功过一起评，相互推动进步。加上有领导的自报公议，就更保证了评记的正确进行。
    运送器材等重活，必须加上评力评斤秤，否则只从数字上评，有些人力气大，扛运得多，力小的出尽力气也得不到表扬，即会泄劲。
    评记方法，应是每班每天或一个任务完了之后，由各班组长接受各个人的工作报告及意见，给总评打下基础。评记的结果，必须交中队或大队审查批准。有不合适的就提出复评，甚至反复的评。到运动总结时，将各段所评的好坏功过都加起来（好坏不能抵消）进行总评鉴定。除发奖给模范者外，应该把各个人的功劳都带回去。对于开小差等错误行为，也必须填上带回。如果对自己毛病经过民主讨论有了新认识，即可不填。这样教育意义很大。
    民工政治工作中几个问题
    第一，要使队员由懦怯变为勇敢，首先要求干部带头撑腰壮胆，沉着指挥。六大队三连给炮兵阵地运道轨，必须通过一段开阔地带。副大队长和副连长首先抬上一根过去了，其他队员便在这种影响下也跟了上去。子弹打到道轨上也没人后退。二大队四中队一个分队的担架一次随营活动，敌人反扑，从侧面包围上来，敌人的炸弹就在避弹洞上爆炸；队员恐惧，想逃跑，分队长袁士生判断了情况，马上给大家解释：“部队还在前边，会把敌人消灭在我们的阵地上，不要乱动，听指挥！”队员没有混乱，也没有伤亡，其次，要在战场上进行实地军事常识教育。长治二大队发现敌机时，便进行防空教育，使队员识辨轰炸机或战斗机、运输机，告诉以各种飞机的特点和如何躲避、超过危险圈等办法。队员有了军事知识，便逐渐从恐惧里解放出来。再次是提高政治觉悟。结合评定伤亡，反对怕死。二大队×中队在评定伤亡时，找出了伤亡原因、是炮弹打过来不知道分散，许多人乱挤，不听指挥。经过反复讨论，以后便好了。
    第二，关于自觉遵守战场纪律、群众纪律及城市纪律问题。战役开始前，要专门进行纪律与政策教育，启发大家爱护解放区，建设解放区的政治觉悟。行动中，必须组织纪律检查。执行好的应表扬鼓励，违犯政策与纪律的要批评纠正。对于违犯政策纪律隐瞒不报和经教育不改者，应给以纪律处分。有的看到破坏纪律不报告，或看见敌人遗弃机枪也不管，这是对革命武器不爱护的自由主义态度，也应及时教育纠正。
    第三，参战民工中设立支部，加强党的领导问题。有的地方因没重视这一工作，使党员失去领导，减弱了党的作用。如某大队第一次评选模范时，选出八十余名，只有五个党员。经过支部检查，党员发挥了积极性。第二次选模范时，即有党员二十余名，占全支部党员百分之四十。民工中队支部工作的任务，应是团结巩固民工，保证任务完成，保证执行纪律，宣传党的政策，在参战中审查党员，教育改造党员，并成为政治工作的依托。因此必须设立党的统一组织为党委会、总支部等。并强化党的领导机构，使民工在健全的一元化领导下发挥更大的战斗力。
