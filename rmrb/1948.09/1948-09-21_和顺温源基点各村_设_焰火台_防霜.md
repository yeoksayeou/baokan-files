　　Taihang Electric: The villages at the Heshun Wenyuan Base Point are actively setting up "bonfire platforms" to prevent frost. The climate in this county is relatively cold, and frost occurs every year between "White Dew" and "Autumn Equinox," which greatly damages unmatured autumn crops. On August 18th, the base point specifically convened a meeting of village cadres to discuss methods for preventing and protecting against frost. The village head of Dongnao Village said: "Prevention doesn't work; last year, the 'bonfires' in our village didn't do anything." Everyone said: "The reason your village didn't work is that you started the fires too late. Last year, the villages of Jiujing, Shengtou, and others started fires appropriately, and not even a mu of land was damaged by frost." After discussion, everyone realized that the reason some villages didn't do well last year was that they had prepared a lot of firewood and only lit the fires for two nights. By the third night, when the frost came, they had no firewood, and the effort was wasted. They immediately learned from the experience and determined the frost prevention measures. After the meeting, most of the masses in each village turned out to collect firewood. By September 3rd, the villages had collected a total of 3,520 dan of firewood. Villages also conducted mutual inspections. The five villages at the entire base point will set up thirty-six "bonfire platforms," each with one more pile of firewood than last year (a total of one hundred and eight piles). Each village organized a frost prevention command headquarters. Around the time of "White Dew," all village militia and self-defense forces were uniformly organized to take turns on guard. If frost is detected, firecrackers will be set off as a signal to light the fires together.

### 和顺温源基点各村　设“焰火台”防霜

　　和顺温源基点各村
  　设“焰火台”防霜
    【太行电】和顺温源基点各村积极设立“焰火台”进行防霜。该县气候较寒，每年“白露”“秋分”间寒霜即降，未成熟的秋禾受害甚大。八月十八日，该基点特召开各村村干会议，讨论防霜护霜办法。东瑙村长说：“防不防不顶事，去年俺村‘焰火’一点事没顶了。”大家说：“你村没顶事，是因为点火点的迟了，去年九京、升头等村点火适当，一亩也没霜死。”经过研究，大家都弄清去年有些村没搞好是因为准备的柴火多，只点了两夜，到第三夜下霜时没柴了，结果白搭了。当即接受教训，定出防霜计量。会后各村大部群众一齐出动打柴，到九月三日，各村共打柴三千五百廿担。村与村并作了互相检查，全基点五个村要设三十六个“焰火台”，每台要比去年多设一堆柴（共一百零八堆）。各村组织防霜指挥部，在白露前后，各村所有民兵自卫队统一组织轮流站岗。发现下霜时以打炮为号一齐点火。
