　　【Taiyue Telegram】The Taiyue Administrative Office and the Military Affairs Committee jointly instructed all special counties to organize the masses to eliminate wolf infestation. According to statistics from Jiyuan, Anze, Qinyuan, Fushan, and other counties, 424 people have been injured by wolves, and the damage to sheep flocks is even greater. In Xishan Village, Yangcheng, forty-two sheep were killed or injured by wolves in one night. As a result, children, women, semi-able-bodied and even fully-able-bodied laborers are afraid to go to the fields alone, which greatly affects production and causes great harm. In order to organize the masses to hunt wolves, solve the difficulties in wolf hunting, and encourage the masses to hunt wolves, the Taiyue Administrative Office and the Military Affairs Committee have issued the following instructions: (1) Counties plagued by wolves should convene meetings of hunters to exchange wolf hunting experience. Militiamen should form the backbone, with hunters participating, to organize hunting and defense. (2) Gunpowder and iron sand should be manufactured or purchased by the Military Affairs Committee and then resold to hunters. Those who buy or manufacture gunpowder can borrow funds temporarily from the local county if they have capital difficulties. (3) To reward the masses for hunting wolves, it is specifically stipulated that a reward of five dou of millet will be given for each wolf killed, and for digging out a wolf den, five dou of rice will be awarded for each adult wolf and two and a half dou of rice for each wolf pup. Individuals who kill more than five wolves will be given the honorary title of "Wolf Hunting Hero" by the government, and will also receive a heavy reward. Groups that kill more than ten wolves will also be awarded the honorary title of "Wolf Hunting Model Group" by the government, and will also receive a heavy reward. Cadres at all levels who have made outstanding achievements in organizing wolf hunting will be rewarded by governments at all levels.
