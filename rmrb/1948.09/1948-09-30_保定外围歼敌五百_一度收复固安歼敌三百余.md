(Jizhong Telegram) Our local troops are actively striking against the enemies who are looting the autumn harvest. At dawn on September 21st, Liu Huanan's troops of the 32nd Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding, carrying many civilians and carts, went to Wangxinzhuang and Caizhuang to loot the autumn harvest. They were intercepted by a unit of our army. Fierce fighting began at 2:00 PM and lasted until 6:30 PM. Under the brave attack of our army, the enemies fled in panic. Our army pursued the enemies to the ditch near Baoding City. In this battle, a total of 390 enemies were killed or wounded, 82 enemies were captured, and one mortar, four machine guns, one submachine gun, two carbines, and fifty rifles, and over 19,000 rounds of various bullets, and a portion of other military supplies were seized.

(Another Telegram) On the night of September 17th, a unit of our local armed forces in western Tianjin launched a surprise attack on Daxian Village, southeast of Huidian, near the Beining Railway, annihilating most of the 1st Company of the puppet Security 25th Regiment. Its 3rd Company was also routed in panic. In this battle, a total of 27 enemies were killed or wounded, 39 enemies were captured, and two machine guns, thirty-one rifles, and over 980 rounds of bullets were seized.

(Jizhong Telegram) A unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Gu'an County, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits located 120 li south of Beiping, on September 18th, creating a victory in the active protection of the autumn harvest. At 4:00 AM that day, our army began to launch an attack on the city. The defending enemies, Wang Fenggang's 15th and 16th Regiments, fearing annihilation, immediately fled in panic to the north of the Yongding River, leaving behind a portion of bandit troops to defend the city and cover the enemy's retreat. Our army immediately launched a fierce attack on these enemies and completely occupied the city in five hours of fighting. The defending enemies fled to Changan City, 25 li northwest of the city, and were scattered by our pursuing troops. In this battle, our army killed or wounded a total of 220 enemies, captured 93 enemies, and seized two light machine guns, seven machine gun bodies, one small cannon, ninety-two long and short guns, seventy blunderbusses, three hundred and thirty-eight broken guns, over 24,000 rounds of bullets, 653 rounds of 60mm mortar shells, over 400,000 jin of grain, 3,000 pairs of military shoes, and many other items. On the 20th, the 121st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 94th Army rushed from Beiping. On the morning of the 21st, they launched a counterattack on Gu'an City. In order to conduct mobile operations to protect the autumn harvest, our army took the initiative to withdraw from the city.
