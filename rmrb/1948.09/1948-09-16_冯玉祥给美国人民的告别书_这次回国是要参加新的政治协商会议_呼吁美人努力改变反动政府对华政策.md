　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. New York dispatch: The American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee published on the 8th of this month the farewell letter to the American people written by the late Feng Yuxiang when he left the United States. In his farewell letter, Feng expressed his deep gratitude for the sympathy and support shown by the American people over the past two years for the anti-corruption and dictatorial reactionary Nanjing regime movement by overseas Chinese in the United States, and for the movement against American aid to this regime. Regarding his return to China this time, Feng said: "I am returning to China to participate in the Political Consultative Conference. The biggest difference between this new Political Consultative Conference and the Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing in 1946 is that Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group are not included. The new Political Consultative Conference will include the Communist Party, the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the Democratic League, other democratic parties in China, and non-party leaders." In his farewell letter, Feng emphasized to the American people: "The current US government and the Republican Party's policy towards China is to sell out the Chinese people by supporting the most hateful and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime with financial and military means in order to prolong its life. As a result, the suffering of the Chinese people is prolonged, American taxpayers' money is thrown into a bottomless pit, and the traditional friendship between China and the United States is also undermined." Feng appealed: "The American people must make every effort to change these harmful policies, which are contrary to the Chinese people's desire for independence." He pointed out: "Today, most American people have no doubt about the inevitable collapse of the Nanjing regime - no matter how much aid it receives from the United States - and the final victory of the Chinese people."

　　冯玉祥给美国人民的告别书
    这次回国是要参加新的政治协商会议
    呼吁美人努力改变反动政府对华政策
    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美国民主远东政策委员会于本月八日发表故冯玉祥氏离美时写给美国人民的告别书。冯氏在告别书中对于过去两年来美国人民对在美华侨反对腐化独裁的反动的南京政权运动，以及反对美国援助这一政权的运动的同情与支持，表示深切感谢。关于他这次回国，冯氏称：“我回到中国去参加政治协商会议，这一新的政治协商会议与一九四六年在重庆举行的政治协商会议之间的最大区别，即是蒋介石与其反动集团不被包括在内。新的政治协商会议将包括共产党、国民党革命委员会、民主同盟、中国其他民主党派以及无党派的领袖。”冯氏在告别书内向美国人民强调说明：“美国现政府以及共和党的对华政策，是用在财政与军事上支持最可恨与最腐败的蒋介石政权、以便延长其寿命的方法，来出卖中国人民。其结果是中国人民的苦难被延长了，美国纳税人的金钱被掷入无底洞，中美之间的传统友谊也被破坏。”冯氏呼吁：“美国人民要尽一切努力来改变这些有害的政策，它们是违反中国人民争取独立的意愿的。”并指出：“今日大多数美国人民已毫不怀疑南京政权不可避免的垮台——不论它获得美国怎样多的援助——以及中国人民的最后胜利。”
