Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 31st: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government issued instructions on August 17th to commissioners and county (city) chiefs, stipulating a work report system to promptly grasp the real situation and correctly guide the implementation of policies. The instructions stated: Recently, the special commissioner's offices and county (city) governments have made improvements in reflecting the situation and reporting work. However, in general, the reports are not timely or frequent enough; some counties have not yet recognized that reporting the situation and work to higher levels is a regular responsibility that should be fulfilled. They only occasionally think of it, do it once in a while, or are forced to do it only when a serious situation has been exposed and adverse consequences have arisen. These are serious manifestations of indiscipline or a state of anarchy.

The instructions pointed out the following shortcomings in existing reports: (1) The situation is not comprehensive, with only isolated phenomena, failing to show the general situation, or only vague overviews, failing to show vivid facts, making it impossible to judge whether the effect is good or bad. (2) The problems are not clear. For the shortcomings, errors, and problems discovered, there is only a general description, with little effort to get to the bottom of things, clarify right and wrong responsibilities, analyze the causes and consequences, and propose practical and reasonable solutions. (3) The plans are not specific. Some plans lack connection with the work that has already been done, becoming an isolated set of history; some have many problems, no central focus, no visible allocation of forces, and no implementation methods. As a result, many reports are lengthy and verbose, but fail to explain the problem.

Based on the above shortcomings, the instructions newly stipulate the following work reporting methods:

A. If any new and important problems occur or are discovered by special commissioner's offices or county governments, they should immediately telegraph or send a letter to the government.

B. Every two months, the commissioner and county chief must personally write a report to the chairman, focusing on the basic experiences and policy implementation in this period of work, pointing out the problems and deviations that have occurred, explaining the crux of the problem, the leadership's understanding of it, and the solutions, rather than a flat narrative of the process. Each report should focus on several important issues at the time and place, and suggestions for the work of the border region and opinions on the higher levels, rather than writing about everything regardless of priority. The materials must be carefully considered and analyzed, specifically explaining the problems. This system will be implemented uniformly starting in September.

C. At the end of each piece of work, a more comprehensive summary report should be made. This report must be written after detailed discussion. The content of the report should not only include vivid and concrete real situations, but also write about the problems encountered in the work process, the handling methods, and the main experiences and lessons learned, striving to be concise and avoid being empty and lengthy.

　　怎样写工作报告？
  　陕甘宁边府指示：要及时经常全面明确
    【新华社西北三十一日电】陕甘宁边区政府于八月十七日指示各专员、县（市）长，规定工作报告制度，以便及时掌握真实情况，正确指导政策之执行。指示中称：近来各专署、县（市）在反映情况及报告工作方面，已有改进。但一般说，报告尚不及时，也不经常；部分县则迄未认识向上级反映情况与报告工作为应尽的经常的责任，仅仅偶然想到，偶一为之，或在严重情况已暴露，恶果已产生的情况下被迫为之，这都是严重的无纪律或无政府状态的表现。
    指示指出现有的报告尚存在如下缺点：（一）情况不全面，或仅有孤立现象，看不出一般情况，或仅有模糊概况，看不到生动事实，效果究属好坏，无法判断。（二）问题不明确，对发现的缺点、错误、问题，只有笼统的叙述，少追根究底、弄清是非责任、分析前因后果、提出确实的合理解决办法。（三）计划不具体，有的计划与已做的工作缺乏联系，成为割断历史的孤立一套；有的问题很多，没有中心，看不到力量配备，也看不到实施方法，因之很多报告长篇大论，却未能说明问题。
    根据以上缺点该指示从新规定工作报告办法如下：
    甲、各专署、各县政府临时发生或发现新的重要问题，应随时立即电告或函告本府。
    乙、专员、县长每两个月须亲自给主席写书面报告一次，着重于这一时期工作中的基本经验及政策的执行，指出所发生的问题和偏向，说明症结所在，领导上对此的认识及解决的办法，而不是平铺直叙讲过程。每次报告应着重写当时当地的几个重要问题，及对边区工作的建议和对上级的意见，而不是不分主次，样样都写。材料必须经过酝酿和分析，具体的说明问题。这一制度，一律于九月份开始实行。
    丙、每件工作终了时，应作较全面的总结报告。此种报告须经详细讨论后写出。报告内容不仅有生动具体的真实情况，并且应将工作过程中所发生的问题和处理办法及主要经验教训写出，力求简明扼要，切忌空洞冗长。
