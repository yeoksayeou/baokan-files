　　Problems in the Work of Fujiazhuang, Xian County
　　The County Party Committee Should Conduct a Review and Make Corrections
To the Editor:
　　Upon reading the "People's Voice" section in the August 15th newspaper, our tears flowed! Our government and our common people are of one heart, so why is there a sense of distance between us? Now, this barrier has been broken through.
　　I am a middle peasant who became well-off after the "May 1st" mopping-up operation in Central Hebei (referring to the large-scale "mopping-up" operation by the Japanese invaders in May 1942). I was very poor in the past. My family of three had only three mu of land and owed 50 yuan in debt. The policies of rent reduction and interest reduction halved the debt burden on me. Through years of labor by the whole family, I gradually accumulated some savings. From 1942 to 1947, I bought more than 12.9 mu of land, redeemed 7 mu of local land, and bought a weaving machine. I have not lent money at interest or hired long-term or short-term laborers. I have only owed money and worked for others. If it weren't for the new regime, I would not have been able to turn myself around. During the land redistribution last year, I was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant and was asked to contribute 7.7 mu of land, all of which was second-grade land (my good land). Later, the poor peasant association distributed part of it, and the rest was left uncultivated. I requested twice from the district to return it to me. The first time, the district agreed to return it, but then said it was not possible. Every time I walked to the edge of the land that I had just bought and cultivated for one season last year, I saw the weeds growing in the field, and my tears fell. I also went to the village cadres. Shao Fulin, the vice-chairman of the new peasant association, said: "I am responsible for the wasteland; if others don't cultivate it, I will." I had to endure it, watching them not cultivating it at all, and the weeds growing more than a foot tall.
　　Now I will talk about the land redistribution work in my village. At that time, the district cadres Li Shangmin and a comrade surnamed Ma were in charge. They removed all the cadres in my village, regardless of whether they were good or bad. No one who was not removed dared to speak. During the mass meeting, the district cadres pointed at the Communist Party members and said, "None of you are good people." What kind of cadres did the district cadres use to manage the land redistribution? The real poor peasants and hired laborers were suppressed in the poor peasant association. Shao Fulin, Gong Fuquan, and others in charge were not long-term laborers or upright poor peasants and hired laborers. They only sought their own interests and did not implement the policies of the Communist Party. First, they determined our class status based on wealth and lifestyle. For example, Liu Yongfa, Gong Yongtang, Wang Dianfa, Liang Xiuqing, Wang Yuanshu, and others had never engaged in any exploitation, but they were all classified as rich peasants. The heads of households were detained, and they were begging for food outside before the wheat harvest. At the same time, they lowered the average land per capita in the whole village (the average was 4.5 mu per person, but they only calculated 3.8 mu). Anyone who exceeded the average was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant and was asked to contribute land. More than 80 households were asked to contribute land. Later, the district did not allow it and reduced it to more than 30 households, selecting good land from the land of those more than 30 households. Second, the distribution of confiscated property only satisfied the interests of a few cadres. Hearing that the wrongly classified status should be corrected, and the confiscated property from the middle peasants that had not been distributed should be returned, and the distributed property should be compensated for, they quickly distributed the confiscated property. There were also problems in the distribution of confiscated property. The poor peasants were divided into ten grades, and the fruits were valued at a price. When distributing, the desperately poor were allowed to choose first. If the value of the items chosen was greater than the money they were entitled to, they had to pay the difference. As a result, honest poor peasants and hired laborers were afraid of paying money and chose fewer items, only receiving some tattered furniture. However, cadres such as Shao Fulin, Gong Sanxing, and Gong Fuquan took more items without paying the difference. Shao Fulin took a cow and should have compensated 600,000 yuan, but he didn't. They only cared about having livestock and farm tools and good land. There were still more than 60 mu of land that had not been distributed, and they didn't care. But they reported to the higher authorities that the poor peasants disliked the land being bad and were unwilling to take it, and the middle peasants disliked the burden being heavy and were unwilling to cultivate the land. In fact, the poor peasants wanted to cultivate it, but they couldn't because they didn't have livestock and farm tools. The middle peasants were afraid of the burden because the burden distribution in our village last year was unfair. More than 80 households did not pay the burden. The method of paying the burden last year was to apply the government's progressive rate, and then divide the points into grades. The first grade was 63 jin, and the fourth grade was 18 jin. As a result, more than 80 households were exempt from tax. Those who paid heavily had to hand over all the grain harvested from the land and it was still not enough. Fighting the enemy at the front and producing and handing over public grain at the rear is an obligation. As long as it is fair and reasonable, we are not afraid of being heavy, and we will just step up production. In the past, we never complained about the burden being heavy, but it was just that the village handled it too unfairly. He concealed this situation from the higher authorities.
　　Please send cadres from the higher authorities to investigate and deal with the problems in our village, and print Chairman Mao's policies into books and send them to the market for the people to voluntarily buy. Only when the people study Chairman Mao's policies can no one distort them. The government and the people are of one heart, but we people have not studied the policies and government decrees well, so we let bad people deceive those above and mislead those below, and do many bad things. I have recently read the newspaper and understand some things. I am writing this letter to you. Please reply.

　　Editor's Note: Based on the situation described by Liu Qingrui, the Xian County Party Committee should conduct an in-depth investigation of this village. If these are indeed the facts, then they are serious violations of the Party's policies. They should be corrected and dealt with in a timely manner, and a public response should be made!

### 献县富家庄工作有毛病　县委应作检查纠正

　　献县富家庄工作有毛病
  　县委应作检查纠正编辑同志：
    看到八月十五日的报纸上的群众呼声，我们的热泪都下来了！咱们的政府和咱们老百姓本是一条心，为什么当中倒象有了隔膜呢？现在这隔膜算是打穿了。
    我是一个中农，是在冀中“五一”扫荡（指一九四二年五月日寇大“扫荡”）以后才起了家的。我过去很穷，家里三口人，只有三亩地，还欠债五十元。减租减息的政策使压在我头上的债利轻了一半，全家长年劳动，慢慢有了一点积余，从一九四二年到一九四七年中，陆续买了十二亩九分多地，赎回了七亩当地，买了一架织布机。我没有放过债，也没雇长工短工，只是欠过债和给别人做过活，要不是新政权来我也翻不了身。去年平分时，说我是富裕中农，叫我出了七亩七分地，都是二等地（是我的好地）。以后给贫农团分了一部，余下的荒着没有人种，我向区上要求了两次，要求给我退回来。第一次区上已答应给退，可是以后又说不行；我每一走到我去年刚买进来才种了一季的地边上，看见地里长着草，难受的眼泪都掉了下来。我又找村干部，新农会副主任邵福林说：荒了我负责，别人不种我种。我只好忍着，看着他们一直没人种，长的草有一尺多长。
    现在我谈谈我村的平分工作吧。当时是区上的干部栗尚敏和一个姓马的同志掌握的。把我村的干部不分好坏都搬掉，一个没有搬的人也不敢说话。在群众大会中叫共产党员站出来，区干部指着共产党员说：“你们没一个好东西。”区干部用什么干部来掌握平分呢？贫农团里真正的贫雇被压下，管事的邵福林巩福全等都不是长年劳动的为人正派的贫雇农，他们只替自己谋利益，不执行共产党的政策。第一、按富力按生活订咱们的成份。如刘永法、巩永堂、王殿法、梁秀卿、王元书等根本就没有过什么剥削，都定成了富农，户主被扣，在麦收前都在外要饭吃。同时把全村每人平均土地的数字压低（每人平均四亩半，他们只算三亩八），凡是超过平均数字的都定成富裕中农，都叫出地。出地户共八十多户，后区上不准，才减到三十多户，把三十多户的地选好地抽出。第二、分浮财只能满足干部少数人利益，听到说是错订了成份要改正，没收中农的东西没分的要退回，分了的要设法补偿，他们就很快的把浮财分了。分浮财中也有毛病，把贫农分为十等，果实折价，分时让赤贫先挑，如挑的东西价值大于应分的钱时，就得把钱拿出，结果老实的贫雇农怕出钱，就少要东西，只分得了些破烂家具。邵福林、巩三兴、巩福全等干部，却是多拿了东西而不拿出钱来。邵福林拉了牛，应补六十万元就没补。他们只顾他有了牲口农具，有了好地；还有六十多亩地没分下去，他们就不管了。但他们向上级报告说：贫农嫌地不好不愿要，中农嫌负担重也不愿种地。实际是贫农想种，因为没分得牲口农具种不了。中农怕负担，是因去年我村负担不公，不拿负担的就有八十多户。去年拿负担的办法是按照政府的累进率累进后，再把分数分成等级，第一等六十三斤，四等十八斤，结果八十多户免税。拿得重的把地里打下的粮食完全交上还不够。前方打敌人，后方生产交公粮，这是义务，只要公平合理，重也不怕，加紧生产就行。过去我们没有嫌过重，只是村里办得太不公平。这种情况他又隐瞒上级不告。
    请上级派干部来调查处理我村的问题，并把毛主席的政策印成书本子，送到集上，让老百姓自愿的买下，只有老百姓学习了毛主席的政策，就谁也不能歪曲了。政府和老百姓本是一条心，只是咱老百姓没很好学习政策政府法令，就让坏人欺上瞒下，办了许多不好的事。我最近看了报纸，心里明白一些，我写这封信给你，请答复一下。
  　　　　　　　　　　献县第十一区富家庄刘庆瑞上
    编者按：根据刘庆瑞所述情况，献县县委对该村应作深入调查。这些若确属事实，则是严重的违反党的政策的现象。应及时纠正处理，并作公开答复！
