Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Comprehensive news reports: The Kuomintang reactionary government is continuing to persecute students in its controlled areas through actions such as arrests, expulsions, and forced signing of "oaths." Following the mass arrests of students in Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu and other places, according to the Associated Press: Eighteen students from Shandong University in Qingdao were arrested on September 18th and sent to the "Special Criminal Court." The Kuomintang Ministry of Education has ordered the expulsion of over two hundred university students in Nanjing who were on a blacklist. Students in colleges and universities in Nanjing and Beiping are being forced to sign "oaths" guaranteeing they will not participate in political movements upon registration for the autumn semester. Those who refuse to sign will not be allowed to enroll. According to the Tianjin Minguo Daily on July 17th: As early as this year's summer vacation recruitment, the Kuomintang Ministry of Education instructed university authorities to: "Pay special attention to the character and behavior of students when recruiting new students this year, and strengthen the responsibilities of parents and guarantors." The above series of fascist actions are a pre-planned conspiracy by the Kuomintang reactionaries to persecute students' patriotic and democratic movements.

　　青岛南京继续迫害学生
  　入学时强迫签署“誓约书”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】综合各方消息：国民党反动政府正以逮捕、开除、强迫署签“誓约书”等行动，继续迫害其统治区学生。继宁、沪、平、津、渝、蓉等地大量逮捕学生后，据美联社消息：青岛山东大学学生十八人，九月十八日被捕解往“特种刑事法庭”。在南京逮捕黑名单内的二百余名大学生，已被国民党教育部下令开除。南京、北平两地专科以上学校学生秋季始业注册时，被强迫签署“誓约书”，保证不得参加政治运动。拒绝签署时即不准入学。据七月十七日天津民国日报披露：今年早在暑假招生时，国民党教育部即指示各大学当局：“本年招考新生时，应特别注意学生之品性行为，及加强家长、保证人之责任”。上列一连串法西斯行动，原系国民党反动派迫害学生爱国民主运动的预定阴谋。
