Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: The Second Administrative Conference of the Northeast Administrative Committee was convened on July 21st and concluded on August 7th, lasting for 18 days. Those attending the meeting included the chairmen of nine provinces, namely Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Nenjiang, Liaoning, Liaobei, Hejiang, Andong, and Rehe; the directors of the Civil Affairs Departments of each province, the mayor of Harbin Special Municipality, the directors of the Social Bureaus, and the principal responsible persons of various departments, committees, institutes, and offices of the Political Committee, totaling several dozen people. The meeting successively discussed agricultural production, burden policies, organizational structures of governments at all levels, the election of people's representatives at the county and district levels and government committees at all levels, and the working style of the government. Finally, Chairman Lin Feng made a concluding report based on the discussions at the meeting.

In his report, Chairman Lin pointed out that the central task of the current government work is: production and construction, supporting the war, and elevating the production and construction of the Northeast Liberated Areas from the existing level. The report pointed out: The industrial construction in the Northeast Liberated Area has a relatively solid foundation. Therefore, restoring and developing industrial production is not only significant for the Northeast Liberation War, but also for the victory of the entire country. However, we cannot reduce the importance of agricultural production because of our attention to industrial production. Agricultural production must not be relaxed; developing agricultural production is as important as developing industrial production. Regarding agricultural production, Chairman Lin instructed: This winter, each province should hold a labor model conference to summarize this year's production experience, especially the experience of being organized; issue land deeds to determine land ownership; build water conservancy projects; select seeds; and eliminate insect pests. Each province should focus on establishing tractor farms to gain experience and train cadres. Existing tractor farms and state-owned farms should summarize experience and improve themselves. Agricultural loans should be used in a concentrated manner for repairing water conservancy projects, manufacturing and improving agricultural tools, and adjusting and improving seeds, and oppose purely relief-oriented viewpoints. Each province and county can establish agricultural experiment stations to improve varieties and establish horse farms to improve horse breeds.

Regarding the issue of government organization, the report pointed out: In the past, due to concentrating efforts on military struggle and mass work, the organizational structures of governments at all levels were not yet sound. Now that land reform has been completed, building the government should be one of the most important tasks within a certain period after the autumn harvest. From now on, we should start trial elections; each province must conduct trial elections in several villages or one district. Before the autumn harvest, hold small-scale training classes; after the autumn harvest, hold large-scale training classes to concentrate village and district cadres and students to participate in the democratic election movement. The election of the three levels of county, district, and village must be completed before next spring plowing. The organizational structures and staffing of government agencies at all levels should be handled in accordance with the three principles of being lean, necessary, and focused. Oppose extravagance, formalism, and egalitarianism. Each province should conduct an organizational consolidation. To strengthen government work, each province should establish administrative cadre schools according to its needs and possible conditions. Regarding the relationship between government departments, there should be unified leadership and responsibility at each level. Except for railways, post and telecommunications, banks, and factories, mines, and power plants of the Ministry of Industry in various localities, which are still under vertical leadership, all departments of governments at all levels are under the direct unified leadership of governments at all levels. Governments at all levels must guarantee the implementation of work tasks, work plans, and various regulations at each level, and must not change the decisions of higher levels without authorization, or even withdraw funds or allocate grain without authorization. The Party must guarantee the implementation of government laws and decrees organizationally. Lower-level Party organizations should respect and implement the decisions and instructions of higher-level governments in the same way as they respect and implement the decisions and instructions of higher-level Party committees; and make Party members become models in abiding by government policies, laws, and decrees.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: In order to implement the decision of the Political Committee's Second Administrative Conference on completing the election of three-level governments at the county, district, and village levels after this autumn harvest and before next spring plowing, the Civil Affairs Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has not only instructed each province to organize trial election groups to select areas for trial elections, but also transferred cadres to form work teams to select villages with a good work foundation, complex social strata, a large population, and relatively mobilized masses to conduct trial election work in order to gain experience and promote the democratic election movement after the autumn harvest. Before their departure, the team spent a week studying the issue of building government.

　　东北召开二次行政会议
    林枫主席指出目前中心任务是生产支前 
    明年春耕以前完成县区村三级民主选举
    【新华社东北十三日电】东北行政委员会第二次行政会议于七月二十一日召开，历时十八天，已于八月七日闭幕。出席会议者有松江、黑龙江、吉林、嫩江、辽宁、辽北、合江、安东、热河等九省主席，各省民政厅长、哈尔滨特别市市长、社会局长及政委会各部、会、院、处主要负责人等数十人。会上先后讨论了农业生产、负担政策、各级政权组织机构、县区人民代表及各级政府委员会的选举，政府工作作风等问题。最后由林枫主席根据会议讨论作出总结报告。
    林主席报告中，指出目前政权工作的中心任务是：生产建设、支援战争，把东北解放区的生产建设由现有水平上提高一步。报告指出：东北解放区工业建设比较有基础，因此恢复与发展工业生产，不仅对东北的解放战争有意义，而且对全国胜利都有意义。但是不能因为注意工业生产，就减低了农业生产的重要性。农业生产决不能放松，发展农业生产与工业生产有同样重要意义。关于农业生产，林主席指示：今冬以省为单位举行劳模大会，总结今年的生产经验，特别是组织起来的经验；发地照，确定地权；兴水利，选种，除虫灾；以省为单位，有重点的举办拖拉机农场，取得经验，训练干部。已有的拖拉机农场、公营农场应总结经验，加以提高。农贷要集中使用，用在修水利、制造与改良农具、调剂与改良种籽等方面，反对单纯救济观点。每省每县都可设立农业试验场，以改良品种；设立马场以改良马种。
    关于政权组织问题，报告指出：过去由于集中力量于军事斗争与群众工作，各级政权组织尚不健全。现在土改业已完成，秋收后在一定时期内应以建政为重要工作之一。从现在起就应开始试选工作，每个省必须试选几个村或一个区。秋收前办小规模的训练班，秋收后则办大规模的训练班集中村区干部及学生参加民主选举运动。在明年春耕前，要把县区村三级选举办完。各级政权机构及编制，应按照精干、需要和有重点三个原则办理。反对铺张、形式主义和平均主义。各省要进行一次组织上的整理。为加强政权工作，各省应根据需要与可能条件开办行政干部学校。关于政府各部门间的关系问题，应该统一领导，按级负责。除铁路、邮电、银行以及工业部在各地的工厂、矿山、电力厂等仍为垂直领导外，其他各级政府各部门，统归各级政府直接的统一领导。各级政府必须按级保证工作任务、工作计划与各种规定的执行，不能擅自改变上级的决定，甚至擅自提款、拨粮等等。党要在组织上保证政府法令的执行，下级党对上级政府的决定与指示，应该象对上级党委的决定与指示一样的予以尊重与执行；并要使党员成为遵守政府政策法令的模范。
    【新华社东北十三日电】东北行政委员会民政部，为贯彻政委会二次行政会议关于今年秋收后至明年春耕前完成县、区、村三级政权选举的决定，除已指示各省组织试选小组，选择地区进行试选外，并抽调干部组成工作队，选择工作基础好和阶层复杂、人口众多、群众发动较好的村子进行试选工作，以取得经验，推动秋收后民主选举运动。该队于出发前以一周时间学习建政问题。
