Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 13th: The Administrative Office of the Western Henan liberated area in the Central Plains, in order to facilitate trade for merchants and residents, expedite the restoration and development of industry and commerce, and promote economic prosperity, recently issued a circular to its subordinates, elaborating on the future tax policy as follows:

    First, unified collection, achieving three major unifications: region, tax rate, and system. Regional unification means that, externally, Western Henan is considered a whole for entry and exit, with each special commissioner's office planning in a unified manner, and all tax collection agencies are unified under the government or transferred to the government; internally, the principle of free trade is implemented; for goods passing through from neighboring liberated areas, the principle of not double-taxing should be implemented. Tax rate unification means that all localities must resolutely implement the stipulated tax rates and must not change them without authorization. System unification means that tax reports must be submitted on time, and all tax revenue goes into the financial income, and no locality may use it privately.

    Second, tax collection should be based on the standard of benefiting the restoration and development of industry and commerce and promoting economic prosperity. All non-prohibited goods are allowed to be imported and exported, and exports of local products and imports of necessities should be exempted or lightly taxed; goods in transit should also be lightly taxed.

    In addition, the circular also stipulates a number of specific issues related to actively organizing reasonable tax collection.

　　便利贸易发展经济
  　豫西确定税收方针
    【新华社中原十三日电】中原解放区豫西行署为便利商民贸易、尽速恢复与发展工商业、繁荣经济，顷通令所属，阐述今后税收方针为：
    首先是统一征收，做到地区、税率、制度三大统一。地区统一是对外以豫西为出入境的整体，由各专署统一筹划，所有税收机关全部统一于政府或移交政府；对内贯彻执行贸易自由；对友邻解放区过境货物应贯彻税不重征的原则。税率统一是各地必须坚决执行规定之税率，不得私自更改。制度统一则是税收表报必须按期送上，一切税款归财政收入，各地不得私自动用。
    其次是税收以有利于恢复与发展工商业、繁荣经济为标准，凡非违禁品即允许入口出口，土产的出口与必需品的入口，应予免税或轻税；对过境货物亦须轻税。
    此外，该通令中还对有关积极组织合理税收的若干具体问题作出规定。
