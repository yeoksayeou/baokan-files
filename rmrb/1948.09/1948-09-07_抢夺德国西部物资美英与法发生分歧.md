Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: The US and France have experienced serious disagreements over plundering resources in the French-occupied zone of West Germany. According to a report by a "Pravda" journalist, French monopoly capitalists are intensifying their large-scale looting of resources in the French-occupied zone of Germany, as it is about to be merged with the US and British zones. To date, almost all steel, chemical, machinery manufacturing, and other industries have become the property of French monopoly capitalists. This action by the French side has greatly dissatisfied the US side. According to a TASS report citing the "Berliner Zeitung", US Military Governor Clay recently sent an ultimatum to the French side, demanding that France immediately cease the dismantling of military factories and heavy industrial factories in the French-occupied zone, and prohibit France from transporting and utilizing resources from the French-occupied zone. The ultimatum threatened France, stating that if the French side refused the above demands, the US side would cut off all economic ties between the French-occupied zone and the Anglo-American joint zone. At the same time, Britain also submitted a memorandum to France regarding this matter. In addition, according to a Telepress report, "in order not to complicate the situation between Washington and Paris," the US government later instructed Clay to ease the pressure on France, put these issues aside temporarily, and resolve them together next spring when the French-occupied zone is merged with the Anglo-American joint zone.

　　抢夺德国西部物资美英与法发生分歧
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方报导：美、法两方为抢夺西德法占区物资发生严重分歧。据真理报记者报导：由于德境法占区即将和美英占区合并，法国独占资本家们正加紧大规模的掠夺该占区物资。截至现在为止，几乎所有钢铁工业、化学工业、机器制造业以及其他各种工业，都变成了法国独占资本家们的财产。法方此举已使美方大感不满。据塔斯社引柏林日报消息：美军总督克莱最近曾以最后通牒一件致送法方，要求法国立即停止对法占区军火工厂和重工业工厂的拆卸，并禁止法国搬运和利用法占区物资。最后通牒威胁法国称：如法方拒绝上项要求，则美方将截断法占区和英美联合占区一切经济上的联系。与此同时，英国也为此向法国提出备忘录。另据电通社消息：“为了不使华盛顿与巴黎之间的形势复杂化”，美政府后又训令克莱缓和对法国的压力，把这些问题暂时搁下，留待明年春天法占区与美英联合占区合并时一并解决。
