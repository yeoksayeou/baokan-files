Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th: The Kuomintang reactionary government has announced that the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement will expire next September. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, Dong Xian Guang, Director of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan Information Bureau, announced that the Kuomintang government had notified the Soviet Union as above. The Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement was originally signed in 1939 between the Soviet Union and the Kuomintang government to facilitate Soviet assistance to China's resistance against Japan and to develop Sino-Soviet trade. It was for a term of ten years, stipulating that both parties would jointly establish the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation to operate air routes from Alma-Ata in Soviet Central Asia to Dihua (Urumqi) and Hami in Xinjiang. Foreign news agency reports indicate that this is the result of US interference in China's internal affairs.
