[Central Hebei Dispatch] Insect plagues have occurred successively in 3,449 villages in 27 counties in central Hebei, including Renqiu, Boye, Lixian, and Shulu, devastating autumn seedlings such as cotton and corn. After the pests appeared, local leading organs immediately mobilized the masses to capture and kill them. Some areas have largely eradicated the pests, while others are still actively engaged in capturing and killing them. Preliminary experience has been gained in pest control in various places. The following is an introduction for reference:

(1) Timely break down ideological obstacles among the masses and eliminate concerns. When mobilizing the masses to capture and kill the pests at the beginning, some people had ideas of relying on heaven for harvest and fatalism. Serious insect plagues occurred in villages such as Yibao in Renqiu. Only a few people were capturing and killing, and most of the masses said passively, "There's nothing we can do." A small number of backward people considered them "divine insects," burning incense and making wishes, not daring to capture and kill them. Some cadres and masses had paralysis and fluke mentality, thinking that the crops were about to ripen, so it didn't matter whether they were killed or not. Some masses had parochialism, fearing that their efforts would be wasted if others didn't join in. Some were afraid of damaging the crops if they failed to kill the pests. Some villages were too busy distributing seized wealth, and the masses didn't go to the fields in time, so they didn't discover the pests in time, which led to the spread of the disaster. For the above ideological obstacles, we must promptly conduct propaganda and explanation, explaining the harm of insect plagues and introducing pest control methods.

(2) Cadres at all levels should attach great importance to this work, actively organize the masses, and personally go to the fields to lead the capture and killing. The party and government leading organs in the Eleventh Sub-district and counties and cities attached great importance to pest control. In Ningjin, all organs left only one or two people behind, and the rest went to the villages to help with pest control. The leading organs of the sub-district dispatched 47 cadres, led by Comrade Guo Fang, secretary of the local party committee, to personally go to the fields to capture and kill the pests, which had a great impact on the masses. Suining, Anguo and other places established district and village "Insecticide Committees" or "Pest Control Headquarters" and other organizations, and the main cadres participated in the leadership. They regularly reported on the disaster situation and inspected the work, which powerfully promoted the pest control work. However, some areas did not pay enough attention to the organization and leadership of this work, and allowed the disaster to develop. For example, after an insect plague occurred in the Ninth District of Renqiu, the central work of the district was still the distribution of seized wealth. When distributing seized wealth in Zhunzhuang, some people asked to kill the pests, but the district cadres explained to them, "Distributing seized wealth is also very important." Some cadres leading the distribution of seized wealth in the villages turned a blind eye to the insect plague and did not report to the district for several days, resulting in a more serious development of the disaster.

(3) After discovering an insect plague, we should concentrate our efforts to carry out encirclement and annihilation. If one round of killing is not clean, we should continue to capture and kill until the pests are completely eradicated to avoid regeneration. In the organization of pest control, some places mobilized all men, women, and children in the village to carry out large-scale cooperation and joint capture. However, according to the experience of various places, this large-scale cooperation method is very easy to become a formality. Many masses are concerned about their own land, and they are not careful when capturing and killing, which can easily damage the crops. Another method is to form small mutual aid groups freely combined by residents, neighbors, and family members. For example, in Liushuang Village, Anguo, the masses freely combined in groups of three or five families to jointly capture and kill the pests. The whole village organized a total of 28 groups, killing pests on more than 400 mu of land a day. This method is better. Another method is to take the household as a unit, with each family killing the pests on their own land. This method is not easy to damage the crops, and it is also easy to mobilize the whole family to kill the pests. However, to implement this method, we must strengthen leadership to prevent inconsistent steps and spontaneous phenomena. We must help some military families, cadre families, and families of martyrs who lack labor power, otherwise it will not be easy to completely eliminate the pests.

(4) In terms of specific methods of capture and killing, some use sticky insect vehicles and sticky insect boats to capture and kill; some use scissors to cut and capture; some grind ash soil that has been burned for several years into powder on a millstone and sprinkle it on the crop leaves in the early morning when there is dew. The insects will die after eating it because their stomachs will swell; some dig ditches around the fields to prevent sticky insects from spreading to other fields and kill them after they climb into the ditches.

　　冀中各地灭虫经验
    【冀中电】冀中任邱、博野、蠡县、束鹿等二十七个县三千四百四十九村先后发生虫灾，不少棉花、棒子等秋苗被咬毁吃光。害虫发生后，各地领导机关立即发动全体群众进行捕打。部分地区已大部扑灭，部分地区仍在积极捕打中。各地捕打害虫，已获得初步经验，特介绍如下，供各地参考：
    （一）及时打破群众思想障碍，消除顾虑。开始动员群众捕打时，部分群众存在着靠天收成及宿命思想。任邱议论堡等村发生了严重虫灭，只有几个人捕打，群众多消极的说：“没法拿”。少数落后群众则认为是“神虫”，烧香许愿，不敢捕打。部分干部和群众存在麻痹侥幸心理，认为庄稼快熟，打不打没关系，有的群众存在着本位思想，怕自己打别人不打白费劲。有的怕打不下来反糟踏了庄稼。还有的村因忙于分浮财，群众没到地里去，没有及时发现，以致蔓延起来。对于上述思想障碍，必须及时宣传解释。说明虫灾害处，介绍捕虫办法。
    （二）各级干部应十分重视这个工作，积极组织群众，亲自下地领导捕打。十一分区的分区及县、市党政领导机关，对捕虫非常重视；宁晋各机关只留一两个人，其余都到各村帮助捕虫。分区领导机关抽出干部四十七人，由地委书记郭芳同志带领，亲自下地捕虫，对群众影响很大。肃宁、安国等地建立区村“杀虫委员会”或“捕虫指挥部”等组织，主要干部都参加领导。经常报告灾情，检查工作，有力的推动了捕虫工作。但有些地区对这一工作的组织领导不很重视，听任灾情发展。如任邱九区发生虫灾后，区里中心工作仍是分浮财。准庄分浮财时，有的群众要求打虫，区干部还给人家解释说：“分浮财也很重要。”有些在各村领导分浮财的干部，对虫灾熟视无睹，几天中没向区里报告，结果使灾情发展的更加严重。
    （三）发现虫灾后，应集中全力实行围歼，一遍打不净，应连续捕打，作到彻底扑灭，以免再生。在捕虫的组织上，有些地方全村男女老幼一齐动员，实行大合伙，联合捕打。但根据各地经验看来，这种大合伙的办法很易流于形式。很多群众惦记自己的地，捕打的不小心，容易糟踏庄稼。另一种是按居住、地邻、本家自由结合组成小型互助组。如安国流双村群众三五家自由结合，联合捕打，全村共组织了二十八组，一天打虫四百余亩。这种办法比较好。还有一种是以户为单位，自家打自家的，这样不易糟踏庄稼，也便于动员全家去打。但实行这个办法，必须加强领导，防止步调不一致和自流现象。对一些缺乏劳动力的军、干、烈属，必须予以帮助，否则不易全部消灭。
    （四）在捕打的具体办法上，有的用粘虫车、粘虫船捕打；有的用剪刀剪拿；有的把烧过数年的灰土，在碾子上砸成面，乘早晨有露水时撒在庄稼叶上，虫子吃后会肚胀而死；有的在地的四周挖沟，使粘虫不向别的地里蔓延，爬到沟里再弄死。
