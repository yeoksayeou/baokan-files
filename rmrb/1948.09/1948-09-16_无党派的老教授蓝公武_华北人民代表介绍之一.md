Non-Party Elder Professor Lan Gongwu
One of the Representatives of the People of North China

Mr. Lan Gongwu is a non-party democratic figure in the North China People's Representative Conference, and a member of the presidium of the conference. He was elected as a member of the North China People's Government Committee in the conference election. He praised this conference as a glorious initiative in the history of Chinese democracy. In his closing speech at the conference, he believed that the conference had two major characteristics. He said: In the old democratic parliaments, all proposals were manipulated for the private interests of individuals and small groups, but in this conference, representatives made detailed discussions on important bills such as the North China People's Government Organization Outline, and seriously put forward amendments. Everyone ultimately followed the interests of the greatest number of people. This is a phenomenon that has never existed in the political history of old China. This is the first characteristic. He called the conference's receipt of more than 1,180 proposals, as well as the conference's serious review and handling of these proposals, the second characteristic of the conference. He said: Since the "National Assembly" since the second year of the Republic of China, it has never received genuine people's proposals, nor has it ever seen such careful treatment of proposals.

Mr. Lan Gongwu is from Wujiang, Jiangsu, and is 63 years old this year. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in Japan during the Xinhai Revolution, and served as a senator of the National Assembly in the second year of the Republic of China. Later, he engaged in journalism, serving as the president of the Beijing Guomin Gazette, director of the Chenbao newspaper, and editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao. After the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he once taught at Peking University. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he taught at China University in Beiping. Because he often published anti-Japanese remarks, he was finally arrested by the Japanese Kenpeitai Headquarters in 1939 and detained for one year. In the autumn of 1945, he went to the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area while ill. He served as the Director of the Education Department of the Chahar Provincial Government and the Director of the Civil Education Department of the North Yue Administrative Office. When the reporter interviewed him, he spoke freely to the reporter about his feelings about working with the Communists in the Liberated Area. He said, "The Communist Party has no secrets in its cause for the people. Whatever I ask, they tell me. Whatever I want to study, I can investigate. Similarly, I say whatever I have, without reservation. Many things that are not within my job scope, I criticize and suggest the same way if I have opinions." He also said: "In the past, what we were doing was old democracy, so we could never do it well. Now that we have New Democracy and the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party, China has embarked on a bright road."

　　无党派的老教授蓝公武
  　华北人民代表介绍之一
    蓝公武先生是华北人民代表大会中无党派的民主人士，大会主席团之一，在大会选举中当选为华北人民政府委员。他盛赞此次大会为中国民主史上光荣的创举。他在大会闭幕词中，认为大会有两大特色，他说：在旧民主的议会中，议案全为个人与小集团的私利所操纵，但在这次大会中，对华北人民政府组织大纲等重要法案，代表们均作了详细讨论，严肃提出了修正案，大家最后都以最大多数人的利益为依归，这是旧中国政治史上所没有过的现象。这是第一个特色。他把大会收到一千一百八十多件提案，以及大会认真的审查与处理了这些提案，称为大会的第二个特色。他说：从民国二年以来的“国会”中，就从来没有收到过真正的人民的提案，也从未见如此审慎的对待提案。
    蓝公武先生是江苏吴江人，今年六十三岁。辛亥时毕业于日本东京帝大，民国二年任国会参议员。以后从事新闻事业，历任北京国民公报社长、晨报董事、上海时事新报总编辑等职。民国十二年后，一度任教于北京大学。抗日战争中，他在北平中国大学任教，因经常发表反日言论，终于一九三九年为日本宪兵司令部逮捕，羁押一年。一九四五年秋，他抱病到了晋察冀解放区。曾任察哈尔省政府教育厅长和北岳行署民教厅长。当记者访问他时，他向记者畅谈在解放区与共产党人共事的感想。他说：“共产党在对人民事业上没有秘密，我问什么就告诉我什么，想研究什么就可以去调查什么。同样，我也有什么就说什么，毫无保留。许多不在我职务范围内的事情，我有意见也一样批评，一样建议。”他又说：“过去我们闹的是旧民主，所以总是闹不好。现在有了新民主主义，有了无产阶级和共产党的领导，中国就走上了光明大道。”
