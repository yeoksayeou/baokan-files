Ta Yue Electric Dispatch: The Donglu Administrative Village work team in Fushan used typical examples from among the masses to persuade them to change their old habits, achieving the application of manure to wheat fields and the mixing of wheat seeds with oil. The soil quality in this village is relatively good, but the customary practice for farming has always been not to apply manure to wheat fields, saving the manure for autumn planting the following year. Recently, when the county work team came to the village to call on the masses to accumulate and deliver fertilizer and to mix wheat seeds with oil, village cadres and the masses all said that wheat fields did not need manure, and oil was too expensive to be worthwhile for mixing with wheat seeds. If manure were applied to wheat fields, there would be no manure for autumn planting, requiring the cutting of artemisia to compost, but the composted grass manure would not be strong, so they all disagreed. After reviewing the situation, the work team immediately went deep among the masses to investigate and discovered that Zhang Fude was good at sweeping the streets to accumulate manure and cutting artemisia to compost, and his crops grew very well, with corn stalks reaching nine feet high, while the average corn stalks were only five or six feet high. Zhang Fude said, "There is no bad land, only bad manure. The land where my corn stalks are growing so well was fertilized with the artemisia compost from last year." The work team used this typical example, first having the Farmers' Association Chairman, Qiao Youde, introduce it to everyone at a cadre meeting. The cadres' thinking changed, and they returned to their respective natural villages, taking the lead in delivering manure to the wheat fields. On the other hand, they began to cut artemisia to compost. Farmers' Association Chairman Qiao Youde delivered 240 dan of manure to the fields and also cut 300 dan of artemisia. At the same time, he promoted Zhang Fude's experience of cutting artemisia to compost everywhere, gradually breaking the habit of not applying manure to wheat fields. On September 7th, various villages reported: Yao Huai, Wang Qing, and others in Juling Natural Village had already composted over 1,000 dan of artemisia manure, and the Dong Shengcai mutual aid group in Ling'er Shang Village had delivered 1,200 dan of manure to wheat fields and composted 500 dan of artemisia. Following this, the work team organized the mixing of wheat seeds with oil. First, they had the experienced old man Xu Lianke promote the benefits of mixing wheat seeds with oil to the masses during a meeting. Mixing wheat with oil is as good as applying manure, making the seeds plump, resulting in a larger harvest, and making the wheat stalks stronger. It can be mixed in the hot season, or mixed at the time of planting. In the hot season, each dou of wheat seeds should be mixed with four liang of oil, and for mixing at the time of planting, three liang of oil is enough. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are even better for mixing at the time of planting. At the village production meeting on the 30th of last month, the work team gave a specific introduction to Xu Lianke's method of mixing wheat seeds with oil, especially using Ling'er Shang Village as an example to calculate the costs for the masses: The village has 156 mu of wheat fields, using 6 shi and 4 dou of wheat seeds. Mixing all of it with oil would only require 16 jin of oil. At 2,000 yuan per jin of oil, the total cost would be 32,000 yuan. After mixing with oil, each mu can yield an additional 5 sheng, and 156 mu can yield an additional 7 shi and 8 dou. Each dou can also produce an extra half jin of flour, totaling an extra 390 jin. After this calculation, the cadres of various villages all agreed and took the lead in mixing when they returned to their villages. Ling'er Shang, Donglu Village, Jia Village, Geda Shang, and Juzhen Village have mixed a total of 10 shi and 6 dou of wheat seeds, which can be used to plant 235 mu of wheat. Currently, various villages are continuing to mix seeds.

### 用事实教育群众改变旧习　东鲁种麦上粪拌种

　　用事实教育群众改变旧习
  　东鲁种麦上粪拌种
    【太岳电】浮山东鲁行政村工作组用群众中典型事例说服群众，改变了群众旧的习惯，作到麦地上粪、麦籽油拌。该村土质较好，但历来做庄稼习惯是麦地不上粪，有粪留着明年上秋地。最近县上工作组到村号召群众积肥送粪、油拌麦籽时，村干群众都说麦地用不着上粪，油太贵，拌麦籽不上算。如果把粪上到麦地，秋地就没了粪，必须割蒿来沤，但沤的草粪又不壮，所以都不同意。工作组检讨后，立即深入到群众中访问，发现张福德好扫街积肥，割蒿沤粪，庄稼长得很好，玉菱长得有九尺高，而一般的玉菱只有五六尺高。张福德说：“有烂地没烂粪，我的玉菱地上的就是去年沤下的蒿粪。”工作组就用这个典型事实，先在干部会上由农会主席乔有德向大家介绍，干部思想有了转变，回到各自然村，以身作则，往麦地送粪。另一方面就开始割蒿沤粪。农会主席乔有德把二百四十担粪送到地里，还割了三百担蒿，同时到处宣传张福德割蒿沤粪的经验，逐渐打破了大家麦地不上粪的习惯，九月七日各村汇报：聚粮自然村姚怀、王青等已沤蒿粪一千余担，岭儿上村董盛才互助组已送麦地粪一千二百担，沤粪五百担。接着工作组组织油拌麦籽，先让有经验的徐连科老汉在开会时向群众宣传油拌麦籽的好处，油拌麦，顶上粪，籽儿肥，打的多，麦秆也硬。伏天能拌，随种随拌也能行，伏天每斗拌油四两，随种随拌三两油就行。菜籽油和棉籽油随种随拌更好。上月三十日全村生产会议上，工作组又把徐连科油拌麦籽的办法作了具体介绍，特别以岭儿上村为例，给群众算了一下帐：该村一百五十六亩麦地，用麦籽六石四斗，全部用油拌只用十六斤，一斤油二千元，共需洋三万二千元，油拌后每亩能增产五升，一百五十六亩能多打七石八斗。每斗又能多出半斤面，共多出三百九十斤。这样一计算，各村干部都同意，回村去就带头拌起来。岭儿上、东鲁村、贾庄、疙瘩上、聚畛村共拌了麦籽十石零六斗，可种麦二百三十五亩，现各村还在继续拌种。
