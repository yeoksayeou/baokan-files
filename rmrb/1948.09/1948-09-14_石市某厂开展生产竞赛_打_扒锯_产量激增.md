　　A Factory in Shijiazhuang Launches Production Competition
  　"Ba Ju" Output Surges
    [Shijiazhuang News] A factory in Shijiazhuang launched a heated competition among its forging workers to produce "Ba Ju" (a type of iron hook with curved points at both ends, used to join two pieces of wood), which also spurred some of the factory's other workers to participate in the competition. The Shijiazhuang Daily reported on August 13th that Workshop C had a production surge of Ba Ju on the 6th and 7th, with one furnace achieving a peak output of 300 pieces. Upon seeing this news, the director of Workshop A said to the workers, "They're even reporting 300 pieces in the newspaper!" The workers immediately replied, "We'll make at least 450 or 500!" Coincidentally, the next day, the factory received an order for tens of thousands of Ba Ju. The workers of Workshop A took the lead in proposing a challenge, setting a competition standard of producing 450 Ba Ju made from 3-fen iron rods (approximately 9.5 mm in diameter) within eight hours, while ensuring good quality. Workshops B, C, and D quickly responded. Workshop B proposed a competition standard of producing 360 Ba Ju made from 4-fen iron rods (approximately 12.7 mm in diameter, thicker and more difficult to forge) within eight hours. The administrative department accepted these requests and, in collaboration with the labor union, organized a judging committee to announce the competition conditions. The first condition was the aforementioned output standard. The second was to ensure good quality. The third was to use three workers per furnace using a blower, or four workers using bellows. The fourth was that any output below the set quantity, quality, or violation of the personnel number regulations would result in disqualification for commendation.

　　The competition began on the 17th and exceeded the predetermined standards on the first day. Wang Liansuo's furnace in Workshop A exceeded the 3-fen iron rod production target by 25%. Workshop B also exceeded the 4-fen iron rod production target by 25%. Output increased rapidly. By the third day, Wang Liansuo and Yu Xinfa's furnace had produced 1,000 pieces in ten hours, and a furnace in Workshop C had produced 950 pieces. During the intense labor of the competition, red-hot iron filings splashed under the heavy hammers. When worker Wu Dongxi burned his hands and feet, he immediately helped with other tasks. The workers didn't have time to drink hot water, so they cooled boiling water and drank it quickly while continuing to work. When the tong-holder went to relieve himself, someone else would pick up the tongs, unwilling to stop even for a moment. The veteran tong-holder in Workshop D, Chi Aibao, 58 years old, was also full of energy, increasing his output from 580 pieces (in ten hours) to 850 pieces, exceeding the target by 51%. By the 26th, the highest record was held by Wang Liansuo's furnace, which produced 1,340 Ba Ju made from 3-fen iron rods in nine and a half hours. The output of 4-fen iron rods from the same furnace increased from 715 pieces to 730 pieces. During the competition, Workshop C also learned the simplified method of cutting iron rods from Workshop A, reducing the number of people cutting from five (first marking the dimensions, then cutting, requiring two steps) to three. This saved labor. The judging committee initially set standards, distributed them to each workshop to follow, and regularly checked the quality to ensure that all products entering the warehouse were good. In the following days, feeling that the quantity was increasing too quickly and fearing that the workers would be overworked, the committee held three consecutive meetings to address the issue of protecting the workers' health. At the meeting on the 26th, they requested that the workers in each workshop and furnace report a number representing a normal level of output based on their specific circumstances, to be submitted to the judging committee for final evaluation. On the same day, the judging committee, along with the directors and inspectors of each workshop, conducted a major quality inspection of the products produced since the beginning of the competition at the warehouse. They found that the quality of the finished products was generally similar to that before the competition and that they were all usable. The results of the evaluation were: Workshop A was ranked first for 3-fen iron rod production, followed by Workshops D and C. Workshop B was ranked first for 4-fen iron rod production, followed by Workshop A. The overall production task is now more than halfway completed and is expected to be finished several days ahead of schedule. In addition, influenced by this Ba Ju production competition, the daily output of 6-fen bridge bolts in a certain workshop also increased from 55 pieces per shift (eight hours) to 95 pieces, exceeding the target by 73%. Staff members in the Personnel Department, Secretary's Office, and General Affairs Section also challenged each other, coming to work early and adding half an hour to one hour of voluntary labor per person, while ensuring increased work efficiency. The factory-wide competition movement is in progress. (Zhang Shen)

　　石市某厂开展生产竞赛
  　打“扒锯”产量激增
    【石家庄讯】石市某厂锻工开展打“扒锯”（即两头有湾尖的铁钩，可钉使两木相连）的火热竞赛运动，并带动厂内一部职工亦实行竞赛。八月十三日石家庄日报反映该厂丙所六七两日突击打扒锯，其中有一炉最高产量达到三百个。甲所主任看到这一新闻后，即和工友说：“人家打三百个都登报啦！”工友们当即说：“咱们至少得四百五百个！”碰巧第二天，该厂受领打扒锯数万个的任务。甲所工友首先提出挑战，决定八小时内打三分铁棍的扒锯四百五十个为竞赛标准，并保证质量要好。乙、丙、丁各所纷即响应。乙所提出打四分铁棍（较粗、难打）八小时内打三百六十个为竞赛标准。行政上接收此种要求即协同分工会组织了评判委员会，公布竞赛条件，除上述两项标准数为第一条外，第二保证质量好。第三每盘炉用鼓风炉的三人，用风箱的四人。第四出产不到以上数量、质量、或违反人员数目规定的，就取消评功资格。竞赛从十七日开始，第一天即超过预定标准，甲所王连锁炉打三分铁棍超过百分之二十五。乙所打四分铁棍亦超过百分之二十五。产量飞速增加，至第三日，王连锁、于新法炉十小时都打了一千个，丙所某炉九百五十件。竞赛中劳动紧张，烧红的铁屑在大锤下飞溅着，武东喜工友被烫坏手脚就又去帮助做别的活，工友们来不及喝热水，即把开水放凉，紧喝两口还打，掌钳的去解手，别人就拿起钳，不肯稍停。丁所掌钳的老工友池爱宝，五十八岁，也精神百倍，由五百八十件（十时）增到八百五十件，超过百分之五十一。至二十六日止，最高纪录王连锁炉，九小时半，打三分铁棍扒锯一千三百四十个。该炉打四分铁棍七时十五分增到七百三十个。竞赛中，丙所还学习了甲所＠铁棍的简便方法，使以前的五个人＠（先按尺寸划印，再＠，经两道手）减为三个人＠。节省了劳动力。开始由评委会亦订出标准，发各所照打，经常检查质量的优劣，保证入库的均是好的。后来几天，感到数量增加太快，怕工友们累坏了，乃经连续三次开会均提出保护身体健康的问题，二十六日会上，并要求各所各炉工友，均根据具体情况提报一种正常产量的数字，交评委会，做最后评判根据。当日，并由评委会及各所主任、检查员，共同到仓库进行了一次竞赛以来的质量大检查，看到成品质量与竞赛前相比，大致差不多，都能用。评定结果：三分铁棍的以甲所为第一，丁、丙次之。四分铁棍的以乙所第一，甲所次之。现总的生产任务已完成大半，预计可提前数日完成。另在此次打扒锯竞赛影响下，某所打六分桥梁螺丝也由每工（八时）五十五个的日常产量增到九十五个，超过百分之七十三。人事科、秘书室、事务股等处职员也互相挑战，提前上班，每人加义务工半小时至一小时。并保证提高工作效率。全厂竞赛运动正在进展中。（张深）
