　　Such "Democracy"!
  　American Reactionaries Hire Thugs
  　To Disrupt Wallace's Speech
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Reports from various sources: Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace has recently been giving campaign speeches in various cities in North Carolina. When he demanded equal democratic rights for black people, he was repeatedly disrupted by thugs. When Wallace gave speeches to black and white people who had gathered together, breaking the "segregation system" in cities such as Durham on August 29, Burlington and Greensboro on August 30, and Carrot and Hickory on September 1, many hired thugs rushed into the venue, throwing tomatoes and eggs at Wallace and making sharp, strange boos. In Durham and Greensboro, when the thugs committed violence, the police were present but remained bystanders. In order to shirk responsibility for favoring the thugs, the state police chief even claimed that "these attacks were all planned by the Progressive Party itself" (Associated Press). However, these thugs only accounted for a small number, "the majority of people in the South are dignified and polite people" (Wallace). In Durham, a small number of thugs were booed out of the venue by the angry audience. It is reported that these thugs' actions are a coordinated effort by American reactionaries to obstruct Wallace's tour in the South.

　　如此“民主”！
  　美反动派雇佣暴徒
  　捣乱华莱士演说
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方报导：美国进步党总统候选人华莱士于最近在北卡罗林纳州各城市发表旅行演说，要求予黑人以同等的民主权利时，曾多次遭到暴徒的捣乱。当华氏八月二十九日在该州的德汉姆、三十日在柏林顿、格林斯伯罗、九月一日在卡罗特及希科里等城向打破了“隔离制度”而聚会在一起的黑人与白人发表演说时，竟有不少受雇佣的暴徒冲入会场，以西红柿、鸡蛋投击华氏，并发出尖怪的嘘叫声。在德汉姆与格林斯伯罗等地，当暴徒行凶时，警察虽然出动，但均采袖手旁观态度。该州警察长为了推卸偏袒暴徒的责任，竟扬言“此等袭击均为进步党自己所策动的”（美联社）。然而这些暴徒仅占少数，“南方大多数人民是端庄有礼的人民”（华莱士）。在德汉姆，少数暴徒即曾被愤怒到会的群众轰出会场。据悉，此等暴徒行动，系美国反动派企图阻挠华氏在南方旅行的配合行动。
