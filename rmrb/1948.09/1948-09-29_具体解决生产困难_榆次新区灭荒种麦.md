　　Concretely Solve Production Difficulties
  　Yuci New District Eliminates Wasteland and Sows Wheat
    [Jinzhong Electric] The bandit Yan caused famine for 20% of the total population and wasteland accounting for 25% of the total land area in Yuci. After the liberation of the entire Yuci territory, the democratic government immediately began mobilizing the masses to restore production, organize self-salvation through production, eliminate wasteland, and rush to sow winter wheat. They put forward the slogan: "Sow more, sow early, and sow quickly; early is better than late; sow more wheat this year, and you won't go hungry next year." It was determined that whoever sows this year will reap next year, and every cadre was called upon to conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization to dispel the masses' concerns about sowing but not being able to eat what they harvest. In order to solve production difficulties, the county government allocated 300 shi of wheat to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor peasants solve the seed problem. During the tense wasteland elimination and wheat sowing movement in the first half of September, county and district cadres went deep into various villages to publicize the Party's land policy and burden policy, achieving considerable results. For example, in the process of mobilizing and organizing the masses to sow wheat in the 4th and 6th districts, initially, the peasants did not understand our land policy and burden policy and dared not produce boldly. The cadres of the district immediately focused on publicizing the abolition of "soldier-peasant integration," clarifying that peasant land belongs to the original owners, and affirming that whoever sows this year will reap next year, and that households with no or little land can have land adjusted from the land occupied by Yan's puppet personnel and public temples. This stabilized the people's hearts, and the masses felt that production was guaranteed, and their enthusiasm greatly increased. Donghao Village in the 4th District has now cultivated 410 mu, accounting for half of the original wheat land. Xihhao has cultivated 220 mu, accounting for 60% of the total wheat land. Central Village in the district, which has more errands, has cultivated 360 mu of its 800 mu of wheat land and is now rushing to sow. Chenkan Village in the 6th District, in addition to finishing sowing the existing 2,164 mu of wheat land, has eliminated mature wasteland and increased wheat land by 150 mu. In the process of restoring production and sowing wheat, the government appropriately adjusted a certain amount of wheat land for military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor peasants with no or little land, and tried to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. For example, launching freely combined small-scale mutual aid teams. Xishagou Village in the 1st District has 170 households, some of which cannot cultivate due to lack of livestock, so they organized mutual assistance between households with livestock and households without livestock, stipulated conditions, and specified that plowing one mu of land is equivalent to overpaying three jin of wheat. In this way, both parties are willing and both benefit. All 30 head of cattle in the village cultivated more than 1,500 mu of land in a sudden attack in ten days. Now they are starting to rush to sow winter wheat. When peasants have difficulties with wheat, they are organized to think of their own solutions, combined with leadership assistance. For example, the 6th District uses various relatives and friends to care for flexible mutual assistance. The 9th District uses fruit trees to buy wheat seeds. The district government also lent the grain left by the enemy to the masses. In addition, they paid attention to the close integration of production and support for the front. Organize all labor to participate in wheat sowing. For example, women in Niedian Village in the 8th District all went to the fields, so that men's participation in the war did not affect production. Of the 1,200 mu of wheat land in the whole district, more than 700 mu have been cultivated. The remaining 400 mu are planned to be cultivated completely in seven days.

　　具体解决生产困难
  　榆次新区灭荒种麦
    【晋中电】阎匪给榆次造下占全人口百分之二十的饥民，占总地亩百分之二十五的荒地。榆次全境解放后，民主政府立即着手发动群众恢复生产，组织生产自救，消灭荒地，抢种宿麦。提出“多种早种快种，赶早不赶晚，今年多种麦，明年不饿肚”的口号。确定今年谁种明年谁收，号召每个干部深入宣传动员，解除群众怕种上吃不上的顾虑。为了解决生产困难，县府拨出三百石小麦帮助军干烈属及贫苦农民解决种子问题。在九月上半月紧张的灭荒种麦运动中，县区干部深入各村宣传党的土地政策与负担政策，获得相当成果。如四、六区在发动与组织群众种麦当中，起初农民对我土地政策与负担政策不摸底，不敢大胆生产；该区干部即抓紧宣传废除“兵农合一”，农民土地归原主、肯定说明今年谁种明年谁收，无地少地户可由阎伪人员霸占土地及公庙产中调剂。这样安定了民心，群众觉得生产有了保障，情绪大为提高。四区东郝村现已耕过四百一十亩，占原种麦地一半。西郝已耕过二百二十亩，占总麦地的百分之六十。该区差务较多的中部村，八百亩麦地，已耕过三百六十亩，现正抢种。六区陈侃村除将现有麦地二千一百六十四亩种完外，另消灭熟荒增加麦地一百五十亩。恢复生产与种麦中，政府适当的给无地少地的军干烈属及贫苦农民调剂了一定的麦地，并设法解决劳畜力困难。如发动自由组合的小型变工。一区西沙沟村一百七十户，有些户因没有牲口不能耕种，即组织有牲口户和无牲口户互助，订出条件，规定耕一亩地顶超资麦三斤。这样双方都自愿，也都得到利益，全村三十犋牲口，十天中即突击耕地一千五百余亩。现开始抢种宿麦。农民麦子困难，即组织群众自己想办法，结合领导上的帮助。如六区是利用各种亲朋关心机动互济。九区用果木变买麦种。区政府也将敌人遗留下的粮食借给群众。此外，他们注意了生产支前密切结合。组织所有劳力参加种麦。如八区聂店村妇女一齐上地，使男人参战不影响生产。全区麦地一千二百亩，现已耕种七百多亩。剩下四百亩，计划七日全部耕种完。
