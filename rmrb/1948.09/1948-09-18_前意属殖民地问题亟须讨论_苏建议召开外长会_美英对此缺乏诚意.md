　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: TASS reports: The Soviet embassies in London, Washington, and Paris were instructed on the 4th of this month to inform the British, American, and French governments that, since the Four Powers' Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference has concluded its work on the issue of the former Italian colonies, and in accordance with the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, the Soviet government considers it necessary to consider the issue of the former Italian colonies at a Foreign Ministers' Conference, in accordance with the order prescribed by the treaty, before the expiration of the treaty-stipulated deadline, that is, before September 15th of this year. Note: According to the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, which came into effect on September 15th of last year, the issue of the Italian colonies should be resolved by the Four Powers' Foreign Ministers within one year of the treaty's entry into force; otherwise, it will be submitted to the United Nations for handling. For a year, the US and British sides have consistently adopted delaying tactics on this issue. Although the Deputy Foreign Ministers have met many times and conducted extensive investigations in the former Italian colonies, no results have been achieved, making it necessary for the Foreign Ministers' Conference to resolve the issue directly.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Since the Soviet government proposed to the United States, Britain, and France on the 4th to convene a Four Powers' Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies, the British and French governments replied to the Soviet government on the 7th and 9th respectively, expressing their agreement to hold a meeting in Paris, but did not mention the date of the meeting. In its two notes to the Soviet government on the 8th and 9th, the US government, on the one hand, disagreed with the Soviet Union's proposal to hold the meeting on September 10th, and advocated postponing it to the 13th. On the other hand, it revealed the United States' lack of sincerity towards this meeting. According to TASS: The Soviet government specifically replied to the US government on the 10th, pointing out that the section in the US note which stated "unless the Soviet government provides new proposals for consideration, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be useless" clearly constitutes an attempt by the US to impose certain preconditions on the convocation of the meeting. This arbitrary statement is unacceptable to the Soviet government. The Soviet reply continued: The US declaration that it would authorize the Secretary of State's representative to attend the meeting, and the statement that the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, and the convening of a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies, are still impossible matters. The reply finally stated that, despite this, the representatives still do not object to holding a Four Powers' Deputy meeting, nor do they object to the date of this meeting in Paris being set for September 13th. Furthermore, the British government adopted the same position as the United States in its second note to the Soviet Union on the 9th, namely that Britain would be represented by Minister of State McNeil, rather than Foreign Secretary Bevin.

　　前意属殖民地问题亟须讨论
  　苏建议召开外长会
  　美英对此缺乏诚意
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社报导：苏联驻伦敦、华盛顿及巴黎各大使馆奉命于本月四日照会英、美、法政府说：由于四强外长代表会议已结束关于前意大利殖民地问题的工作，按照意大利和约规定，苏联政府认为必须在和约所规定的期限满期以前，即是说，在本年九月十五日以前，在外长会议中按照和约所规定的次序考虑前属意大利的殖民地问题。按：依照去年九月十五日起生效的对意和约的规定，意大利殖民地问题应由四强外长于和约生效后一年以内解决，过时即提交联合国处理。一年以来，美英方面对于此一问题始终采取拖延策略，各外长代表虽曾多次集议并曾赴前意属各殖民地作广泛调查，但仍未获结果，以致必须经由外长会议直接解决。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】自苏联政府于四日向美英法三国建议召开四国外长会议讨论前意大利殖民地问题后。英法两国曾于七日及九日分别复文苏联政府，表示同意在巴黎举行会议，但未提及会议举行之日期。美国政府于其八日及九日致苏联政府的两次照会中，一方面不同意苏联于九月十日举行会议之建议，而主张延至十三日举行，另方面又透露出美国对这次会议的缺乏诚意。据塔斯社讯：苏联政府为此特于十日复文美政府，指出美国照会中所称“除非苏联政府以新的建议提供考虑，外长会议将属无用”一节，显系美国向苏联提出某种召开会议先决条件之企图。这种武断的声明不能为苏联政府接受。苏复文继指出：美国宣称将授权国务卿的代表出席会议一点，并声明对意和约的规定，并且召开外长会议讨论前意属殖民地问题，还是不可能之事。复文最后表示，虽然如此，代表们仍不反对举行四强代表会议，亦不反对这一在巴黎举行的会议之日期订为九月十三日。又讯，英政府于九日致苏联的二次照会中，采取了与美国相同的立场，即声称英国将由国务大臣麦克奈尔代表出席，而非由外相贝文出席。
