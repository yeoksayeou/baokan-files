Xinhua News Agency, North China, 24th—Livestock deaths are quite serious in some areas of North China. The governments of these areas are taking various measures to encourage livestock raising to remedy the situation. Since this spring, some areas, during land reform, confiscated surplus livestock from landlords and rich peasants and adopted unreasonable methods of distributing livestock in proportion to land acreage. For example, in Beichima Village, Huolu, five or more households had to share a mule; in some villages in Yangqu, nine households had to share an ox. Moreover, the households sharing livestock were not always voluntarily organized. Some stipulations required feeding each animal two jin of grain and fifteen jin of grass per day, which became unaffordable over time, causing the livestock to become sick. Because livestock was shared, work that people could do was also assigned to the animals, leading to a backlog of work for each household and exhaustion for the animals. Some were even used without being fed adequately, leading to their eventual death from exhaustion. In Dongguan, the urban area of Huolu, nine livestock acquired as fruits of land reform were not distributed and were cared for by hired laborers employed by the farmers' association. Due to poor care, four of them died. In some areas, the interests of middle peasants were infringed upon in the organization of production mutual aid. For example, in Xiaoyudi Village, Huolu, cadres forced the masses to form twenty-eight large mutual aid groups, stipulating the exchange of labor and animal power. Members' livestock was used on average; poor peasants (referring to those who were poor before land reform, who, although they had received land, often still lacked livestock) did work for middle peasants, while middle peasants allowed poor peasants to use their livestock. However, because middle peasants generally had little need for poor peasants to do work for them, it effectively became the middle peasants helping the poor peasants with their livestock. Moreover, some poor peasants used the middle peasants' livestock, but did not feed them after use and sent them back, causing many animals to become exhausted and sick. In terms of wartime service burdens, there were also instances of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in many villages in Yangqu, it was stipulated that households with livestock would bear wartime service burdens, while those without livestock would not. Those with good livestock would bear more burdens, and those with poor livestock would bear fewer burdens. In addition, accounts were not carefully settled, resulting in unfair burdens, causing some farmers to not cherish or be unwilling to raise livestock. Due to these reasons, coupled with natural disasters, over 200 livestock have died in Huolu since March this year. In Yangqu, about 200 livestock have been reduced this year due to illness and exhaustion (overexertion, temporary inability to use), and in Renqiu First District, 48 livestock have died since the Lunar New Year, greatly affecting production.

To protect livestock, the Jinnan Administrative Office has stipulated that breeding stock, pregnant stock (two months before and one month after birth), young stock with one pair of teeth, and livestock purchased less than three months ago are exempt from corvée labor. It encourages public and private collective breeding of livestock. County and city governments purchase breeding bulls and donkeys, advance feed, and entrust reliable farmers to feed and breed them. Those who continuously raise them for two years will have the breeding stock become the property of the feeding household. In addition, it encourages the transport of livestock and promotes the prevention and treatment of animal diseases. The Yangqu County Government, in addition to determining improved methods for wartime service burdens and rewarding livestock raising, particularly emphasized the proper handling of livestock ownership. To this end, it clearly announced: whether livestock is purchased with loans, acquired as fruits of land reform, or received as relief, whoever is given it owns it and cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or exchanged. If there are too many households sharing livestock, and the livestock is not well fed, and the masses are willing to have one or two households raise them, they can be valued according to the opinions of the masses. The households willing to raise them can compensate the remaining households sharing the livestock at the assessed price, and the livestock will be definitively owned by the household that paid the price.

　　阳曲、获鹿等地
  　牲畜死亡现象严重
  　有的地区实行奖励喂养牲畜
    【新华社华北二十四日电】华北部分地区牲畜死亡现象相当严重，各该地区政府正采取种种奖励喂养牲畜的办法，以资挽救。今春以来，某些地区在土地改革中没收地主和征收富农多余的牲口，采取了按照地亩数量伙分牲口的不合理的办法。如获鹿北郗马村五户以上才伙分到一头骡子，阳曲有些村子九户才能伙分到一头牛；而这些伙分牲口的各户又不完全是自愿组成的。伙喂时有的规定牲口喂一天用二斤料十五斤草，日久喂不起，牲口都病了。因为伙分了牲口，人能干的活也留给牲口，各户积活很多，牲口太累，有的甚至光使不喂，慢慢就累死了。获鹿城区东关有九头土改果实的牲口没有分配，由农会雇长工喂着，因照顾不好便死了四头。有些地区，在组织生产互助上侵犯了中农利益。如获鹿小于底村干部强迫群众组成二十八个大互助组，规定人力畜力变工，组员的牲口平均使用，贫农（指土地改革前的贫农，他们虽已分得土地，但多仍缺乏牲口）给中农做活，中农让贫农使牲口。但因一般中农很少用得着贫农做活，实际上成了中农用牲口帮助了贫农；更有些贫农用的中农牲口却是用完不喂就送回去，因而牲口累坏了很多。在战勤负担方面，也有侵犯中农利益的现象，如阳曲不少村庄规定有牲口的负担战勤，没有牲口的不负担，牲口好的多负担，牲口不好的少负担，又不认真结算帐目，因此负担不公，使部分农民不爱护或不愿喂牲口。由于这些原因，加上天灾等原因，获鹿自今年三月以来，牲畜死亡在二百头以上，阳曲今年因病、乏（劳动过度，一时不能使用）减少牲畜约二百头，任邱一区从旧历新年到现在，已死亡牲畜四十八头，影响生产很大。
    为了保护牲畜，冀南行署已规定种畜、孕畜（产前两月，产后一月）、一对牙的儿畜及购进不满三个月的牲畜免除差役。奖励公私伙养种畜，由县市政府购买种牛种驴，预借饲料委托可靠农户喂养交配；连续喂养二年者，种畜即归喂养户所有。此外并奖励贩运牲口，推广畜病的预防与治疗方法。阳曲县政府除确定改进战勤负担办法和奖励喂养牲畜外，特别强调妥善处理牲畜的所有权，为此明确宣布：不论是贷款购买、土改果实或救济的牲口，给了谁就是谁的，不得任意抽换；凡伙分牲口户数太多，牲口没有喂好，群众愿意给一家或两家喂养者，可根据群众意见作价，由愿喂养户按价偿还其余伙分牲口的各户，牲口即确定归出价户所有。
