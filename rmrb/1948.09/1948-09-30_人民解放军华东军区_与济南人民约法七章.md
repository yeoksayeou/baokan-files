　　III. All Chiang bandit public-owned factories, enterprises, banks, companies, warehouses, freight yards, etc., must be subject to investigation and dealt with accordingly. If they are indeed bureaucratic capital, they should be taken over by the democratic government. If there is indeed a portion of private capital, their ownership should be recognized, and they should be allowed to voluntarily engage in joint ventures with the democratic government. All personnel working in bureaucratic capital enterprises are expected to continue to work with peace of mind and be responsible for protecting assets, documents, charts, accounts, archives, etc. Await takeover. Those who have contributed to the protection will be rewarded, and those who are negligent or destructive will be punished. The democratic government will allow all the above-mentioned employees to be employed and will pay their wages as before.

　　IV. All management agencies such as tap water, electric lights, telephones, post and telecommunications, railways, automobiles, universities, middle and primary schools, civil education centers, libraries, cultural relics, historical sites, hospitals, churches, charitable organizations, and entertainment and sports venues, as well as all directors, managers, factory directors, employees, technicians, workers, principals, professors, faculty members, students, curators, deans, bishops, pastors, etc., our army will protect them all without infringement, and we hope they will continue to perform their duties as usual.

　　V. Except for the main war criminals, all officials and police of the Kuomintang provincial, municipal, and county-level government agencies, as well as personnel such as district, township, town, and bao chiefs, who do not resist with weapons, will not be captured or arrested by our army. They should all stay at their posts, obey the orders of our army and the democratic government, hand over weapons and ammunition, and be responsible for protecting the assets and archives of various agencies. They must not conceal or destroy them, and await takeover and disposition, and be employed separately.

　　VI. The consulates of various countries and their personnel, and all foreigners and their property, who abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government, do not act as enemy spies, and do not conceal war criminals or engage in any destruction, will be protected.

　　VII. Whether before or after our army enters the city, all citizens and people from all walks of life in the city must be jointly responsible for maintaining order in the city and preventing destruction. Those who have contributed to the protection will be rewarded, and those who conspire to destroy will be punished.

Our army has strict discipline, fair buying and selling, and will not take a single needle or thread from the people. We hope that all citizens will live and work in peace and contentment, and refrain from causing panic. Let people from all walks of life be informed.
