Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS Washington Dispatch: The Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission issued a statement on the 17th regarding MacArthur's violation of the Commission's two decisions on the principles of Japanese trade union organization and the basic policy toward Japan after the Japanese surrender. The statement explained that, based on the Commission's right to review the political direction taken by the Supreme Commander of the occupying forces in Japan, it demanded that MacArthur cancel the anti-strike directive and cease the suppression of Japanese workers. According to Agence France-Presse: Representatives of the Japanese trade union leaders' delegation, after visiting the Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan on the 14th, visited British representative Shaw on the 16th, requesting him to raise the issue of Japanese anti-strike legislation at the Far Eastern Commission. Shaw expressed the hope that MacArthur "will not disregard the opinions of the representatives of the Allied Council for Japan." According to Reuters dispatch on the 17th, Shaw, when meeting with representatives of the League for the Defense of Democracy on the 25th, expressed surprise at the Japanese government's anti-strike order and assured them that he would try to have the issue submitted to the Far Eastern Commission. Shaw has forwarded the petition of the League for the Defense of Democracy to the Australian government on the 17th. As for the attitude of the United States, according to the US News Service, the US representative to the Far Eastern Commission shamelessly announced on the 16th that the US government fully agrees with MacArthur's action to prohibit Japanese civil servants from striking.
