　　The Korean, Indonesian, and Japanese People are Increasingly United
　　Greek Democratic Army Wins Unprecedented Great Victory
    The Korean people victoriously completed the election of the Supreme People's Assembly of all Korea on August 25th. This election produced 572 deputies representing all strata of the Korean people, with 360 elected from South Korea and 212 from North Korea. The newly elected Supreme People's Assembly of Korea solemnly opened in Pyongyang on September 2nd, and the People's Assembly will soon approve the Korean Constitution and elect a national democratic government. From the passage of the charter of the Korean People's Democratic Republic by the North Korean People's Assembly in April this year, to the first and second joint conferences of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea in April and June, to the creation of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, all indicate an unprecedented increase in the awareness and unity of the Korean people. In the election of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, seven million voters in South Korea (half of the total population of 14 million in South Korea) bravely participated in the election campaign, overcoming numerous difficulties and persecutions, which eloquently proves the complete failure of the U.S. imperialist enslavement policy and the extreme isolation of the South Korean reactionaries.
    The Socialist Party, Labor Party, Indonesian Socialist Labor League, and the All-Indonesia Socialist Youth League, which participated in the Indonesian Democratic People's Front, merged into the Indonesian Communist Party in late August. This is an event of great political significance in the history of the Indonesian national liberation movement. The great development of the Indonesian Communist Party and the emergence of a new leading organ will undoubtedly strengthen the national revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.
    Members of the Japanese Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party, along with leaders of labor unions and farmers' associations, gathered in Tokyo in late August and decided to form a new organization that could develop into a democratic national front. Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, stated that the current situation in Japan is conducive to the establishment of a broad people's front representing workers, peasants, the middle class, and even small industrialists. This people's front will fight to defend national independence, democracy, civil rights, and the economic interests of the majority of the people.
    The Battle of Grammos, the largest since the Greek Civil War, ended on August 21 with the Democratic Army victoriously breaking through enemy lines and advancing behind enemy lines. According to the final statistics released by the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, the Democratic Army, in 70 days of heroic fighting against an enemy with ten times the manpower and fifty times the equipment, killed, wounded, and captured more than 30,000 enemy troops. This is an unprecedented and significant victory for the Democratic Army. The great significance of this victory is: first, it completely shattered the U.S.-Greek reactionaries' wishful thinking of eliminating the main force of the Democratic Army in the Grammos area, causing it to fail; second, it attracted the main force of the royalist fascist army, allowing the Democratic Army to develop in other parts of Greece, especially in Romilia, where the Democratic Army has recovered large areas occupied before this battle; third, it proved the invincible fighting will and powerful fighting strength of the Democratic Army, thereby encouraging the courage and confidence of the people of Greece in their struggle. In short, it greatly weakened the enemy and strengthened itself. Now, in the liberated areas of Greece, the Democratic Army is launching offensives everywhere; in the areas ruled by the Athens government, workers have launched waves of strikes. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party pointed out: "After the repeated battles of Grammos, a new situation has emerged throughout Greece." "The royalist fascists are now closer to their end than ever before."
    Other important international events of the past week are:
    (1) The first phase of the British imperialist war against the Malayan people – the "forest clearing campaign" – has failed. British imperialism has had to transfer reinforcements from various places to cope with the "serious threats" encountered in various regions.
    (2) The World Congress of Cultural Workers in Defense of Peace, attended by representatives from 46 countries, was held in Poland in late August. The congress adopted a declaration in defense of peace and decided to establish an international liaison committee in Paris.
    (3) The movement of the Yugoslav people against the Tito clique is growing. This movement has not only occurred among Yugoslav Communist Party members, Yugoslav students studying abroad, and Yugoslav diplomats abroad, but, more importantly, it is occurring within the Yugoslav army. The Tito clique's recent reorganization of the Yugoslav government and the large-scale replacement of opposition elements in various party, government, and military departments are proof of the growing anti-Tito movement.
    (4) Due to widespread demands for wage increases, the French workers' movement has surged again. The dire consequences of economic policies and the surge in the workers' movement have forced the Mali government to step down, and Lamadier and Schumann have successively made failed cabinet experiments amidst numerous difficulties.
    (5) To demand improved living conditions, three million Italian poor peasants and agricultural workers held a half-day national protest strike on August 21.
    (6) Comrade Zhdanov, one of the outstanding leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a great communist, passed away on August 31. The working people of the entire Soviet Union and the world deeply mourn him. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 朝鲜印尼日本人民日益团结　希腊民主军获空前伟大胜利

　　朝鲜印尼日本人民日益团结
  　希腊民主军获空前伟大胜利
    朝鲜人民于八月二十五日胜利地完成了全朝鲜最高人民议会的选举。此次选举共产生了代表全朝鲜各阶层人民的议员五百七十二人，南朝鲜选出三百六十人，北朝鲜选出二百十二人。新选出的朝鲜最高人民议会已于九月二日起在平壤隆重揭幕，人民议会即将批准朝鲜宪法与选举全国民主政府。从今年四月北朝鲜人民议会通过朝鲜人民民主共和国宪章，今年四月和六月南北朝鲜各政党及社会团体又举行第一次和第二次联席会议，到朝鲜最高人民议会的产生，都表示全朝鲜人民觉悟和团结的空前提高。朝鲜人民最高议会的选举，南朝鲜有七百万选民（即占南朝鲜总人口一千四百万之半），冲破重重困难与迫害英勇地参加了选举运动，十分雄辩地证明了美帝国主义奴役政策的完全失败和南朝鲜反动派的十分孤立。
    参加印尼民主人民阵线之社会党、劳工党、印尼社会主义劳工联盟以及全印尼社会主义青年团，已于八月底先后相偕并入印尼共产党，这是印尼民族解放运动历史上有巨大政治意义的事件。印尼共产党的大发展和新的领导机关的产生，毫无疑问，将加强印尼人民的民族革命斗争。
    日本共产党及左翼社会党议员与工会及农会领袖们于八月底在东京集会，决定组成一个可能发展为民主民族阵线的新组织。日共总书记德田球一曾发表谈话称：目前日本情势，有利于建立代表工人、农民、中产阶级甚至小工业家的广泛人民阵线。这一人民阵线将为保卫国家独立、民主、公民权利以及大多数人民的经济利益而战斗。
    希腊内战以来最大的格拉姆斯山区战役，已于八月二十一日以民主军之胜利突破敌阵并挺进敌后而宣告结束了。据希共中央公布的最后统计，民主军在与十倍的人力、五十倍的装备这样优势的敌人英勇作战的七十天中，共毙伤俘敌总数在三万人以上。这是民主军空前的大胜利，而且具有伟大意义的胜利。这一胜利的伟大意义是：第一，它完全粉碎了美希反动派妄图消灭民主军主力于格拉姆斯山区的如意算盘，并使之归于失败；第二，它吸引了保皇法西斯军的主力，而使全希腊其他各地的民主军得到了发展的机会，特别是在罗米利亚，民主军已收复了此次战役前被占的大片地区；第三，它证明了民主军不可征服的战斗意志与强大的战斗力量，从而鼓舞了全希腊人民斗争的勇气与信心。总之，它大大地削弱了敌人而加强了自己的力量。现在，在希腊解放区，民主军正到处发动进攻；在雅典政府统治区，工人已掀起了罢工浪潮。希共中央政治局指出：“在格拉斯姆一次又一次的战斗之后，全希腊已产生了新的形势。”“保皇法西斯现在比任何时候更接近于它的末日了。”
    过去一周的其他重要国际事件是：
    （一）英帝国主义反马来亚人民战争的第一阶段——“森林扫荡战”已告失败。英帝国主义不得不由各地纷调援军，以应付各地遭遇之“严重威胁”。
    （二）有四十六国代表参加的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会于八月底在波兰举行，大会通过了保卫和平宣言并决定在巴黎设立国际联络委员会。
    （三）南斯拉夫人民反对铁托集团的运动在日益增长中，这种运动不仅已经在南共留外党员、南国留外学生、南国外交人员中发生，而且特别重要的是已经在南国军队中的发生。最近，铁托集团之改组南斯拉夫政府以及大批撤换党政军各部门中的反对分子，是对于反铁托运动日益增长表现的证明。
    （四）由于普遍的增资要求，法国工人运动再度高涨。经济政策的恶果和工人运动的高涨已迫使马利政府倒台，在困难重重之下，拉马第和舒曼又相继作了失败的内阁试验。
    （五）为要求改善生活地位，三百万意大利贫农和农业工人于八月二十一日举行了半天全国性抗议罢工。
    （六）苏联共产党卓越的领袖之一，伟大的共产主义者日丹诺夫同志于八月三十一日逝世，全苏联和全世界的劳动人民都深为哀悼。（新华社）
