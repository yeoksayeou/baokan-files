【Taiyue 21st Dispatch】 Lichengpo, Jiyuan, and Mazhu villages are using reciprocal guidance and organizing "little teachers" to lead self-study, popularizing literacy education for children in mountain villages. Lichengpo and Cheng'an villages are a little over half a kilometer apart, and they jointly hired a teacher who rotates between the villages to teach every morning and afternoon. After class, "little teachers" lead self-study. To overcome the difficulty of "not being able to teach," the little teachers are first taught phonetic symbols to look up small dictionaries. Even when the teacher is not present, the "little teachers" can teach literacy. Currently, eighteen fourth-grade students have all learned to use dictionaries. Mazhu administrative village has two schools, with the branch school teacher being兼 (concurrently) held by the administrative village school teacher. Every afternoon, the teacher goes to the village to lecture the children on books and judge imitations (large characters), and correct compositions. After the lecture, the little teachers also lead tutoring. Every Sunday, they hold an achievement exhibition together, visiting each other to learn from each other. This overcomes the difficulty of small villages not being able to afford teachers, allowing children in scattered small villages to have the opportunity to learn.

　　轮回教学运用小先生制
  　立城坡普及山庄儿童教育
    【太岳二十一日电】济源立城坡马主等村用轮回轮导，组织“小先生”领导自学的办法，普及山庄小村儿童的识字教育。立城坡和成庵全村相离一里多，伙请着一个教员，每日上下午轮流到各庄上课，下课后由“小先生”领导自学。为了克服“教不了”的困难，先教小先生注音符号查小字典。教员不在，“小先生”也能教识字。现在四年级十八个学生，都已学会查字典。马主行政村，有两个学校，分校教员由行政村学校教员兼，每天下午到庄上给儿童讲书判仿（大字），改作文。讲后也由小先生领导补习。每星期日并在一块举行成绩展览，互相参观，这样克服了村小请不起教员的困难，使分散的小庄上的儿童也得到了学习的机会。
