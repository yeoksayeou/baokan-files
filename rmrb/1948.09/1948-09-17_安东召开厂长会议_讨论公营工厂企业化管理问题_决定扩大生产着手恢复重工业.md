Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th. The Liaodong Financial and Economic Office convened a conference of factory directors from the Andong region in mid-July to summarize the production work of various factories in the first half of the year. It was decided that the central task for the second half of the year would be to expand production and begin restoring heavy industry. The conference also put forward specific requirements for the production volume of each factory. According to the conference's inspection, since Andong was liberated again in June of last year, in the past year, almost all state-owned enterprises in the Andong area, except for individual factories that were completely destroyed by the enemy and certain heavy industries, have eliminated the scars of enemy destruction. The average production capacity has recovered to 90% to 95% of the Puppet Manchukuo period. Some, such as a certain textile factory, have even exceeded the number of spindles operating during the Puppet Manchukuo period by 43%. Due to the greatly increased labor enthusiasm of the workers, the production achievements in the first half of this year have made significant progress compared with the second half of last year. For example, the total amount of yarn spun by a textile factory in the first half of the year exceeded the second half of last year by 300%. The output of artificial fur from the Andong Silk Weaving Factory exceeded 165%. The Saima Coal Mine completed 84% of its annual production target in the first half of the year. In terms of factory management, there have also been many achievements in the past six months. For example, the Andong Silk Weaving Factory established a statistical reporting system and a hierarchical reporting and inspection system, and strictly implemented receipt and expenditure procedures and warehouse management. The factory director used these systems to grasp the overall production situation of the factory. The savings of various factories in the first half of the year reached more than 1.3 billion yuan for the rubber and silk weaving factories alone. However, from the perspective of enterprise management of factories, various factories still have, to varying degrees, a certain state of indiscipline, lack of planning, and handicraft-style work practices. The conference believes that the following issues urgently need to be resolved in the future:

    I. Cost Accounting

    Whether cost accounting is correct or not is the main indicator of measuring whether a factory is well-run. Cost accounting includes the accurate calculation of raw materials, material costs, labor costs, property depreciation costs, and management fees. Because some factories have not accurately investigated and assessed the actual property, and have not made a property depreciation rate, and at the same time have not established or improved a regular raw material and material inventory system, the calculation of the two elements of cost calculation—raw materials and materials—and property depreciation cannot be accurate. Secondly, some consumption is not calculated or is not calculated at the actual price in the cost, such as the raw material of iron, because it does not need to be purchased, the pricing is particularly low; parts or raw materials and materials found from the waste pile are used or consumed, and they are not included in the cost; some data does not calculate the cost at the current actual price but at the original price, thus forming the illusion that the price of raw materials and data is low and the price of finished products is particularly high. Correct cost accounting must first accurately investigate the property (including raw material and material inventory and other property) and conduct an assessment to understand the total capital of the factory, and then determine the property depreciation rate. In addition, there must be accurate work-hour statistics, and then calculate the ratio and standard profit rate of the four expenses—raw materials, materials, labor, depreciation, and management—in various finished products according to a certain price, and study ways to reduce costs from the reasons for the rise or fall of the proportion of various expenses in each period.

    II. Establish Statistical, Reporting, and Inspection Systems

    The accuracy of cost accounting must have sound statistical, reporting (hierarchical reporting), and inspection systems. Some factory cost accountants only simply keep accounts, and do not supplement them with investigation and statistical work, so they cannot understand the problems that occur in the production process, and cannot study the reasons for high or low costs. If statistical personnel are set up in each department and even each unit, a hierarchical reporting system is implemented, and a sound daily work report and timely inspection work are carried out, responsible cadres can avoid the busyness of bureaucracy and can understand the number of absences, the amount of work-hour losses, the amount of raw materials and materials entering and leaving the warehouse, the amount of finished products put into the warehouse, the amount of waste losses, what difficulties have occurred, and how to solve them in a timely manner every day; and can timely calculate the ratio of labor costs and raw material costs and the loss rate in a finished product to ensure the accuracy of cost accounting.

    III. Organization of Labor

    After having correct cost accounting, one of the important issues in reducing costs is the rationalization of labor organization and use. Some factories have increased production efficiency and saved raw materials by 50% to 100% in the past year, but they still consume too much manpower. For example, indirect production personnel in the Saima Coal Mine account for half of all production personnel. The labor cost of a finished product in the silk weaving factory accounts for 55%. The rational organization and use of labor, in addition to being familiar with the efficiency of the machine and improving labor conditions, the main thing is to organize and give play to the labor enthusiasm of the workers. There are two methods for this: one is the merit campaign; the other is the establishment of a progressive wage system and an attendance system. For example, a factory in a certain textile factory stipulates certain conditions for each grade of wages, such as how many spindles to watch, the quality standard, and caring for the machine. After watching one machine is reduced from two people to one person, the efficiency is doubled. Due to the implementation of the attendance system, which stipulates full attendance rewards, no rewards for absenteeism, and wage deductions, the attendance rate has been greatly improved, reducing preparation work.

    IV. Training Technical Workers and Cadres

    Another key to factory management is to improve and enhance technology. Generally speaking, various factories attach less importance to strengthening technology than to the political work of workers. The responsible cadres of the factory are not proficient enough in business and technology; a certain number of middle-level cadres and technical personnel have not been trained in time. Those who have been promoted are used more and educated less; a large number of new workers have poured into the workers, making skilled workers relatively reduced; therefore, technology is stagnant at a lower level and cannot be quickly improved. The number of people watching spindles in a certain spinning factory is 50% more than the general standard; some factories have very low product quality; and some have wasted raw materials and labor. On the contrary, there is an example of the Andong Silk Weaving Factory, which improved its technology, especially replacing the curved needles and triangular needles used for combing cotton, which made the combed cotton more uniform. The yarn spun reduced "big bellies" and the twist was also even. There were fewer breaks during weaving, thus reducing waste, increasing effective work hours, and improving the quantity and quality of products. Workers also increased from one person seeing less than 100 spindles to seeing 300 spindles. And because the work was smooth, the morale was high. At present, relying on schools to train technical personnel cannot completely solve the current urgent needs. Therefore, the main method is that each factory should cultivate and improve them in its own production process. This requires advocating respecting teachers and loving apprentices, strengthening the unity of new and old workers, persuading old workers to be willing to introduce technical experience, and listing taking apprentices as one of the merit conditions. The leadership should organize and summarize technical experience and disseminate it. Existing technical personnel should be respected and united, given certain work responsibilities, politically guided to progress, and given necessary preferential treatment in life, so that they are loyal to the cause and give full play to their technical abilities, and assist in training new technical personnel.

### 安东召开厂长会议  讨论公营工厂企业化管理问题　决定扩大生产着手恢复重工业

　　安东召开厂长会议
    讨论公营工厂企业化管理问题
  　决定扩大生产着手恢复重工业
    【新华社东北十四日电】辽东财经办事处于七月中旬召开所属安东区各工厂厂长会议，总结本年度上半年各厂生产工作，并决定下半年的中心任务是扩大生产及着手恢复重工业；会议并提出了对各厂生产量的具体要求。据会议检查，自去年六月安东再度解放后，一年来安东地区国营企业除个别被敌彻底破坏的工厂与某些重工业外，几乎全部工厂已消除了敌人破坏的创痕，生产力平均恢复到伪满时的百分之九十到九十五；有的如某纺织厂开动的纱锭且超过伪满时百分之四十三。由于工人的劳动热忱大大提高，本年上半年的生产成绩与去年下半年比较，均有显著进步。如某纺织厂上半年纺纱总数超过去年下半年的百分之三百；安东丝织厂人造毛皮的产量，则超过百分之一百六十五；赛马煤矿在上半年就完成全年生产任务的百分之八十四。在工厂管理方面，半年来也有很多建树。如安东丝织厂建立了统计表报制度与按级汇报检查制度，严格执行了收支手续与仓库的管理，而厂长就通过这些制度来掌握全厂生产情况。各厂上半年的节约，仅胶皮、丝织两厂即达十三亿余元。但从工厂的企业化管理来看，各厂还或多或少存在着某种无纪律、无计划的状态与手工业的工作作风。会议认为今后极需解决下列各问题：
    一、成本计算
    成本计算的正确与否是测量工厂办得好与坏的主要标志。成本计算包括对原料、材料与人工费、财产折旧费、管理费的精确计算。由于有些工厂对实际财产的调查与作价不确实，又未作出财产的折旧率，同时又没有建立或健全经常的原料、材料盘存制度，因而对计算成本的两个要素——原料、材料，与财产折旧的计算就无法确实。其次有若干消耗未计算或未以实价计算在成本内，如铁的原料，因为不用买，定价就特别低；从废品堆里找出的零件或原料、材料被使用或消耗了，也都未计入成本；有些资料则不以目前实价而按原来价格计算成本，因而形成了原料、资料价格低，而成品价格特高的假象。正确的成本计算必须首先精密地调查财产（包括原料、材料盘存及其他财产）并进行作价，以了解工厂的资本总额，再订出财产折旧率。此外必须有精确的工时统计，再按照一定的价格计算出原料、材料、人工、折旧、管理四种费用在各种不同成品中的比率及标准的利润率，并从各种费用所占比率在每个时期上升或下降的原因之中，以研究出减低成本的办法。
    二、建立统计、表报与检查制度
    成本计算的精确，必须有健全的统计、表报（按级汇报）与检查制度。有的工厂成本会计只单纯的记帐，没有辅之以调查统计工作，因而对生产过程中所发生的问题无法了解，无法研究成本高或低的原因。如果在各科甚至各股中设置统计人员、实行按级汇报制，健全工作日报与及时的检查工作，便能使负责干部避免事务主义的忙碌，而能每天及时了解缺勤多少，工时损失多少，原料材料出入多少，成品入库多少，废品损失多少，发生什么困难，需要怎样解决等问题；并能及时计算出一件成品中工费与原料材料费的比率与损失率，保证成本计算的精确。
    三、劳动力的组织
    有了正确的成本计算后，降低成本的重要问题之一便是劳动力组织与使用的合理化。有些工厂在生产效率上，在原料的节省上，一年来提高了百分之五十至百分之百，但人力仍过多耗费。如赛马煤矿的间接生产人员占全部生产人员的一半，丝织厂一件成品的成本，人工费占了百分之五十五，合理的组织使用劳动力，除必须熟悉机器的效能与改善劳动条件外，主要的是组织与发挥工人群众的劳动积极性。为此有两个方法：一个是立功运动；一个是累进工资制与考勤制度的建立。如某纺织厂一厂规定了各等工资的一定条件，如看多少锭子、质量的标准，爱护机器等后，看一架机器由两人减为一人，效率提高了一倍。由于实行了考勤制度，规定了全勤奖励缺勤不奖并扣发工资等办法，出勤比率大大提高，减少了准备工。
    四、培养技术工人与干部
    工厂管理的另一关键是改进与提高技术。一般地说：各厂对加强技术落后于对工人的政治工作。工厂的负责干部在精通业务和熟悉技术上不够；一定数量的中层干部及技术人员没有及时培养起来。已经提拔的也使用多，教育少；在工人中涌进了大批新工人，使熟练工人相对减少；因此技术停滞在较低的水平上，无法迅速提高。某纺纱厂看锭子人数比一般的标准多百分之五十；某些工厂因产品质量很低；有的则因浪费了原料和人工。相反的例子，则有安东丝织厂因改进技术，特别是更换了梳绵用的弯针和三角针，使梳出的绵均匀了，纺的纱减少了“大肚子”，捻度也匀了，织时断头少了，于是减少了浪费，增加了有效工时，提高了产品的数量和质量，工人也由一个人看不到一百锭子增加到看三百锭子，并因工作顺利，情绪高涨。在目前要依靠学校来培养技术人员是不能完全解决当前迫切需要的，因而主要的办法是各工厂应在自己生产过程中来培养提高。这就必须提倡尊师爱徒，加强新老工人团结，说服老工人乐意介绍技术经验，并把带徒弟列为立功条件之一。领导上则要组织与总结技术经验，予以传播。对现有技术人员要尊重与团结他们，给以一定工作责任，政治上引导其进步，生活上予以必要优待，使其忠于事业，发挥其技术能力，并协助培养新的技术人员。
