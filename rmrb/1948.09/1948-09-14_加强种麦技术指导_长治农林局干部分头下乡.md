　　Strengthening Wheat Planting Technical Guidance
  　Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Cadres Go to the Countryside in Groups

    [Taihang News] After studying, cadres of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau realized the importance of developing agricultural production, improving agricultural tools, selecting superior varieties, and improving agricultural technology in the future, which greatly increased their confidence in their work. In the past, some comrades were not interested in agricultural and forestry work and felt that it was not a promising field. After studying, they settled down. In order to improve their professional knowledge and skills, the bureau's agricultural experiment group and the Zuoquan branch of the Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Group, a total of 20 people, combined practical experience with academic studies to study the upcoming wheat planting issues on the 15th of last month, including the source and prevention methods of wheat diseases such as wheat smut and jaundice, as well as frost prevention, seed selection, autumn forest protection, and nursery techniques and practices. They are preparing to issue documents to local governments to uniformly deploy and guide the masses. Then, they went to the countryside in groups, to counties such as Licheng, Changzhi, Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Heshun, to carry out the following main tasks: 1. Organize and guide the masses to prevent and control wheat diseases and insect pests (jaundice, smut, black ear, etc.) to plant wheat well. Focus on selecting areas with serious smut, establish base points, provide specific guidance, and convene meetings of heroes, skilled farmers, village cadres, and technical committees to specifically study wheat disease prevention work, combining science with the practical experience of the masses. Organize specially invited farmers in Li (cheng) and Lu (cheng) and other places to conduct acclimatization experiments with improved wheat varieties. 2. Organize frost prevention. This year, thunder came early and frost will definitely come early. In severely affected areas, participate personally and organize the masses to prevent frost. 3. Organize seed selection to prepare for next year's large-scale production. Educate the masses to recognize that seed selection is an important method for increasing production and resisting diseases. If good varieties that can be promoted are discovered, select them locally and promote them locally. Organize the masses to conduct field seed selection by household or mutual aid group/team. 4. Summarize the "August 11th" millet and Golden Queen corn to determine future promotion policies. Conduct investigations and comparisons, pay attention to cost calculation, collect feedback from the masses, and be realistic and avoid subjectivism. 5. The key points of this autumn's tree planting and afforestation are mainly forest protection, especially large mountain forests. Organize the masses to protect them and prohibit random felling. In addition, pay attention to river forest protection and conduct autumn afforestation experiments on river滩. When conditions permit, mobilize the masses to collect tree seeds and conduct nursery sowing or replanting. 6. In order to further study soil pesticide insecticidal methods, three people were specially selected to go to the Qianwu Mountain area of Licheng to collect Chenopodium album and other soil medicines and absorb the masses' experience for experimentation.

　　加强种麦技术指导
  　长治农林局干部分头下乡
    【太行讯】长治农林局干部经过学习，认识到今后发展农业生产及改良农具、选择优良品种、提高农业技术等的重要，大大提高了工作信心。个别同志过去对农林工作不感兴趣，觉得吃不开。经过学习后，也安心了。为了提高业务知识与技术，上月十五日该局农业试验组与二专农林组左权分场共廿人，以实际经验与学科结合研究了即将到来的种麦问题，包括麦子乌霉、黄疸等病状来源与防治方法，及防霜、选种、秋季护林、苗圃等技术与做法。准备印发文件给各地政府，统一布置指导群众。接着即分头下乡，分至黎城、长治、襄垣、榆社、和顺等县，进行以下主要工作：一、组织指导群众防治小麦病虫害（黄疸、乌霉、黑穗等），把麦种好。有重点的选择乌霉严重地区，建立基点，具体指导，并召开英雄能手村干技委会，专门研究小麦防病工作，以科学与群众实际经验结合进行。在黎、潞等地组织特约农家，作优种小麦风土试验。二、组织防霜。今年开雷早下霜一定早，在严重地区要亲自参加，组织群众防霜。三、组织选种，为明年大生产做好准备工作。教育群众认识选种是增产抗病的重要办法。发现有可推广的好品种，就地选，就地推广，组织群众以户或互助组、队为单位，进行田间选种。四、总结“八一一”谷与金皇后玉茭，以确定今后推广方针。调查比较，注意成本计算，搜集群众反映，态度要实事求是，克服主观主义。五、今秋植树造林重点，主要是林木保护，特别是大山林。组织群众保护，禁止乱砍伐。另外注意河林保护，并做河滩秋季造林试验。有条件时，可发动群众采集树籽，进行苗圃下种或补种。六、为进一步研究土药剂杀虫办法，专门抽出三人到黎城仟仵山一带采集藜蒌等土药，并吸收群众经验试验。
