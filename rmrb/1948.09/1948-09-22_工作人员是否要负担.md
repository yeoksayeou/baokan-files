　　To the Editing Comrade:

    Are soldiers, administrative cadres, local workers, and other personnel under the supply system required to bear burdens? Is the tax exemption point deducted? Is family life taken care of?

    In addition, how are personnel in factories and shops, as well as various craftsmen and freelancers, some on a salary system, some on a profit-sharing system, required to bear burdens? Please answer.

    Answer: This question has been answered by the Border Region Government's Finance Department as follows:

    All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army under the supply system, as well as staff members of the government and mass organizations, are exempt from corvée labor. When calculating agricultural burdens, one tax exemption point is deducted for each such person in their household. As for the care of the family life of local administrative cadres, it can be handled according to the "Regulations on Substitute Farming for Revolutionary Staff Family Members" stipulated by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Administrative Committee. The families of revolutionary soldiers can be determined to be eligible for substitute farming based on the availability of labor in the family. All workers, staff members, shop assistants, and rural craftsmen in industrial and commercial enterprises, whether on a salary system or a profit-sharing system, pay war support grain and are exempt from corvée labor. The payment of war support grain can be collected uniformly by factories and shops and does not need to be paid to the village government in the original place of residence; if some factories and shops do not collect uniformly, it can be collected by the village government in the original place of residence.　　　　——Editor

　　工作人员是否要负担编辑同志：
    战士、行政干部、地方工作等人员均是供给制是否负担？免征点除不除？家庭生活上是否照顾？
    另外工厂商店等人员和各种手艺人自由职业者，有的薪金制，有的分红制，如何负担？请解答。

    答：这个问题已请边府财政厅答复如下：
    凡供给制的人民解放军之指战员、政府及群众团体的工作人员，其本人一律免除差役负担，在计算农业负担时，均在其家庭扣除其本人一个免征点。至于地方行政干部家庭生活上的照顾，可依照晋冀鲁豫边府与晋察冀行政委员会规定的革命职员家庭代耕办法处理。革命军人家属可视其家庭有无劳力情况确定与其代耕。凡工商企业部门，薪金制或分红制之工人、职员、店员及乡村手艺工人，均纳战勤米，免差役负担。战勤米之缴纳，可在工厂商店统一收，不向原籍村公所缴纳；如有的工厂商店没有统一收者，可由原籍村公所收。　　　　——编者
