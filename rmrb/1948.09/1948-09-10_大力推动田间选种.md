　　Vigorously Promote Field Seed Selection

　　"A strong mother bears fat children," good seeds grow good crops. In crops everywhere, there are those with stiff stalks and strong wind resistance, those with strong drought resistance, and those with strong resistance to pests and diseases. For example, the "72" wheat has mild jaundice, and the 811 millet (i.e., Da Zimu millet) has long awns and is not afraid of wind erosion. A kind of "Qi Si Wu" sorghum is completely unafraid of fog. If we select seeds with stronger wind resistance, drought resistance, and pest and disease resistance, we can reduce many disasters. People often see that in a field of crops, some are ripe, while others are still green, and they grow at uneven heights, making cultivation and harvesting very inconvenient. If seed selection is done well, this situation can be avoided. Seed selection is usually done in the field. If the crops are taken home or to the threshing ground for selection, it is easy to see their yield and the size of the ears, but other things are difficult to determine.

　　(1) What kind of seeds should be selected?

　　Because the geology (i.e., soil texture), climate (temperature), the needs of the masses, and planting habits vary from region to region, such as some places that are constantly plagued by wind disasters, what the masses urgently need are seeds with strong wind resistance. Some places are arid nine years out of ten, and what they urgently need are drought-resistant seeds. Some places grow one or two crops a year. The standards for seed selection cannot be uniformly enforced. Therefore, the following standards are for reference only and serve as a general basis for seed selection: 1. Select those with high yield. In the same field, select the type of crop that yields the most. For example, in good waterlogged land, 811 millet can yield more than ordinary millet by one dou per mu. 2. Select those with good harvest quality. Select those with dense grains, plump and full kernels, and heavy weight. For example, in the Ping Mountain area of the North Yue District, along the Hutuo River, there is a type of corn called Da Jinhuang, which has bright color, solid kernels, tastes good, is heavy, and produces a lot of flour. It should be the object of our selection. 3. Select those with relatively stiff stalks. For example, in Tang County, there is a type of Da Niutui millet, which has very stiff stalks. This type of crop is not easily laid down and is not easily damaged. For example, near Lingshou City, there is a type of "Qi Si Wu" sorghum, which is not afraid of fog. 4. Select those with strong resistance to pests and diseases. 5. Select those with the same ears. When selecting seeds, it is important to recognize what the original seed ears look like and select ears of the same type. If they are mixed up, the purity of the variety cannot be maintained, and the yield will become lower and lower.

　　(2) How to select?

　　1. Pick ears in the field. When corn, sorghum, etc., are ripe, two days before harvesting, first go to the field to pick the seeds and bring them home, then dry them, thresh them, and store them separately as seeds. For example, when selecting corn seeds, select ears that are neither too low nor too high from the ground. Leave the same number of leaf roots for each ear, so that they will grow to the same height in the coming year. After leaving the corn, it can be stored with the husks for a few days before husking. After the ears are dried, rub off the kernels from the upper half of the cob and also rub off the kernels from the root, leaving only the middle section. The kernels from this section will grow uniformly, neatly, and vigorously. 2. Select by plot or section. Select a plot or a section in a large field with good harvest and stiff stalks, harvest it separately, thresh it, and store it separately as seeds. Small-eared crops such as millet, rice, sorghum, and foxtail millet can be handled in this way because they require more seeds. 3. Organize the masses to visit and exchange. This year, agricultural farms in various places have promoted some seeds among the masses (811, Bai May, etc.). When harvesting, the production leaders in various places should assign special personnel to be responsible for organizing experienced old farmers to visit in the form of old farmer symposiums, especially in well-connected market towns and cities. This method of seeing the actual effect with one's own eyes has a great effect. When the masses and old farmers recognize that this seed is good through visits, they will spontaneously start exchanging it. This exchange is a very good method of seed selection. 4. Pay attention to selecting good local seeds. Various regions have some good local seeds. The production leaders in various places should propose good seeds that are popular with the local masses on the spot and appropriately lead the masses to carry out exchanges. Because they are suitable for different regional soil qualities, climates, and needs, they are often easily accepted by the masses.

　　Finally, gradually hand over the task of seed selection to the broad masses of women in practical work. One of the reasons why field seed selection has not been widely carried out despite years of advocacy is that the masses are busy with supporting the front and there is a lack of labor. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to gradually hand over this task to the broad masses of women in the future.

### 大力推动田间选种

　　大力推动田间选种
    “母壮儿肥”，种子好就能长好庄稼。各地庄稼里有秸秆硬，抗风力强的，有耐旱力强的，也有抵抗病虫害力量较强的，例如“七二”小麦生黄疸轻，八一一谷（即大孳母谷）穗头毛长，不怕风磨，有一种“气死雾”高粱完全不怕雾。如果我们挑选了抗风抗旱抗病虫害力量较强的种子，就可以减少许多灾害。人们时常看到一块地里的庄稼，有的熟老了，有的还正青，并且长得七高八低，使耕种收割很不方便，如果作好了选种工作，这种情形就可以避免。选种子通常是在地当中选，如果把庄稼拿到家里或场里选，除可以看出他收成好坏，穗头的大小外，其他都不易办到。
    （一）选什么样的种子？
    因为各个地区的地质（即土脉土性）、气候（天气的冷热）、群众的需要和种植的习惯不同，如有些地方不断的闹风灾，群众迫切需要的就是抗风力强的种子。有些地方十年九旱，他们所迫切需要的就是抗旱的种子。有些地方一年种一季或两季。选种标准，不能强求统一，因此下面所说的这些标准，只能供大家参考，作为选种的一般根据：一、选产量大的。在一样的地里，那一种庄稼打得多，就去选拔那一种。如八一一谷在好水地里，每亩就能比平常的大谷子多打一大斗多。二、选收成成色好的。粒子密的，个子肥满饱实的，分量重的，如北岳区平山一带滹沱河岸上有一种棒子名叫大金黄，色道鲜亮，粒子坚实，好吃，分量重，出面多，它就应当是我们选择的对象。三、选秸秆比较硬的。如唐县有一种大牛腿谷，秸秆就挺硬，这种庄稼不易铺倒，不易损害。如灵寿城附近有一种“气死雾”高粱，这种高粱就不怕下雾。四、选抗病虫害力量强的。五、选一样的穗。选种时应当认清原种是什么样的穗就还选什么样的穗。如果混乱了，就不能保持纯种，产量就会越来越低了。
    （二）怎样选法呢？
    一、到地里挑穗。当棒子高粱等长熟了，还未收割前两天，先到地里把种挑下收到家里，另晒另打另保存起来作种子。如选棒子种，应当选离地皮不低不高的穗，要留几个叶根的就一律留几个叶根的，这在来年也就会长的一般高。棒子留下后可以带皮存放几天再剥皮，穗子晒干了，把上半截小棒粒揉去，根部的粒子也揉去，只要当中的一段，这一段棒子粒种起来整齐、匀整、健壮。二、块选或片选。选一块或在大块地当中挑一片收成好，秸秆硬的庄稼，另收另打另外保存起来作种子。谷子、稻子、黍子、稷子等小穗庄稼，用种子较多的都可以这样办。三、组织群众参观互换。今年各地农场推广场，在群众中实际推广了一些种子（八一一、白马牙等），当收成时，我们各地的生产领导上应责成专人负责，就地以老农座谈会的形式组织有经验的老农参观，特别在四通八达的集镇和城市，这种亲眼见实效的参观方法作用很大，当通过参观、老农公认这种种子好时，就会自发的展开互换，这种互换是一种很好的选种方法。四、注意挑选本地的好种子。各个地区都有一些本地的好种子，我们各地的生产领导上应就地提出本地群众所欢迎的好种子，适当的领导群众展开互换。因适合不同地区的土质气候和需要，故往往很容易为群众所接受。
    最后，在实际工作中把选种的任务逐步交给广大妇女。田间选种虽经多年提倡，至今还没有广泛搞起来的原因之一，就是群众的支前生产忙，劳力缺乏。因此，今后逐步的把这个任务交给广大的妇女，是完全必要的。
