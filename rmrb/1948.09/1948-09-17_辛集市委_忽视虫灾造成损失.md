　　Xinji City Committee
  　Neglects Insect Plague, Causing Losses
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Xinji City Committee neglected an insect plague and failed to organize the masses to kill the insects in a timely manner, leading to the spread of the disaster. More than 6,000 mu of millet and sorghum leaves were eaten, accounting for 80% of the planted area. Corn has already been partially damaged and the plague is spreading to sorghum and bean fields. When small armyworms, the size of ants, were discovered in the rural millet fields under the city's jurisdiction on August 10th, they were not widespread. The Industry Department of the Municipal Government, together with the farm, immediately convened a forum of old farmers from various streets and villages and initially discussed methods for controlling the insects. However, because the Municipal Party Committee did not effectively lead the killing effort, it did not achieve practical results. Public Security Bureau cadres continued to go to the countryside to conduct household registration surveys, the Armed Forces Department was busy reorganizing the militia, and the Youth League and Women's Department did not break away from their departmental work. They did not participate in the killing themselves, and also occupied some of the village cadres. At that time, the leadership mostly believed that the insects were still small and harbored a mentality of taking chances. After dragging on for three days, the armyworms became larger, more numerous, and more widespread. The Municipal Party Committee then began to pay attention, and cadres began to go to the countryside to urge the masses to kill the insects. However, there was still a lack of in-depth organization and mobilization, and the groups rarely exchanged information or summarized experiences. A few days later, many people, witnessing the severity of the disaster, developed a feeling of disappointment that "nothing can be done." Some cadres showed helplessness. A civil affairs clerk of the government said: "There are so many insects, they will eat everything." But the facts proved that those who grasped the work tightly and improved the methods of killing in a timely manner suffered less losses. Xinji Farm discovered armyworms at the same time, but because they grasped the extermination tightly, various crops suffered very little damage. Wei Hengyun from Huheying Village, a family of three, worked tirelessly day and night to kill the insects, and saved more than ten mu of millet. But these experiences were not promoted in a timely manner. It was not until August 20th that the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres to examine this sluggish work style, re-allocated forces, introduced experiences, and called on everyone not to slacken and to fight to protect the existing crops.

　　辛集市委
  　忽视虫灾造成损失
    【本报讯】辛集市委忽视虫灾，未及时组织群众捕杀，致使灾情蔓延，谷黍叶子有六千余亩被吃光。占种植量的百分之八十。玉茭已一部受害，并向高粱豆地发展。该市所属农村谷地于八月十日发现蚂蚁大的黏虫时，并不普遍，市府实业科并协同农场，马上召开各街村老农座谈会，初步商讨了治虫办法；但由于市委没抓紧领导捕杀，未收实效。公安局干部照常下乡作户口调查，武装部忙于整编自卫队，青年团妇女部也没脱离部门工作，自己不参加捕打，还占住一部分村干部，当时领导上多认为虫子还小，存有侥幸心理。拖拉了三天，黏虫越大、越多、面也越广，市委才开始重视，干部也开始下乡督促群众捕杀。但仍缺乏深入的组织与动员，各组很少交流情况、总结经验。几天以后，许多群众目睹灾情严重，产生了“怎么也不行了”的失望情绪。有些干部表现束手无策。官府一个民政科员说：“虫子这么多，怎么也得吃光了。”但事实却证明：凡抓的紧和及时改进捕打方式，都少吃亏。辛集农场同一时期发现黏虫，但因抓紧扑灭，各种作物受害极小。胡合营村魏恒运，一家三口，没松劲的昼夜捕打，十来亩谷都救下了。但这些都没有及时推广。至八月二十日，市委才召开干部会议，检查这种迟缓的作风，重新配备了力量，介绍了经验，号召大家不要松劲，为保住现有的庄稼而斗争。（行军）
