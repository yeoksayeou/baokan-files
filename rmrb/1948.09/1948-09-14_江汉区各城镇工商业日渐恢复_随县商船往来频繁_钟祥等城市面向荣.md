Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th: Industry and commerce in various towns in the Jianghan District are gradually recovering. After Sui County was recovered again in early June, merchants who had left have returned one after another to resume business. Currently, the city's merchant ships are traveling frequently, business is booming, and prices have generally fallen. Firewood and salt prices have more than halved. Grain stores sell more than 500 *shi* of grain daily. After Zhongxiang was recovered for the second time, Zheng Shaowen, the director of the administrative office, personally went to guide the city's restoration work in early July and held forums with representatives from business, education, and medicine, with more than 200 representatives attending. After Director Zheng announced the democratic government's policy of earnestly protecting industry and commerce, he explained that in this war environment, *bao-jia* personnel must continue to work but must faithfully obey and execute the laws of the democratic government, maintain public order, and not engage in undermining sabotage. The representatives expressed their support. The city market has gradually returned to normal. Industry and commerce in Tianmen, Yuekou, and the towns of Xingouzu and Fengkou on the south bank of the Han River have also recovered and have seen considerable development. Xingouzu originally had 535 industrial and commercial establishments. Eleven relocated and 41 closed down before and after liberation. From the second half of April to the beginning of June, 63 new flour mills, egg shops, machine-made noodle factories, mills, and trading firms were opened, as well as a new theater, bringing the total to 547, an increase of 12 compared to before liberation. The democratic government has fully investigated, returned, or compensated industrial and commercial establishments in the city that were wrongly handled when it was first liberated. Landlord Xiao Mingzhen, after taking back his oil press, has officially resumed business and is striving to expand his operations. The industry and commerce in Fengkou Town has increased from 40 to 109, with another 15 preparing to open. Two hundred merchants and residents who were deceived by the Kuomintang army have returned to resume their old businesses.

　　江汉区各城镇工商业日渐恢复
  　随县商船往来频繁
  　钟祥等城市面向荣
    【新华社中原十一日电】江汉区各城镇工商业已日渐恢复。随县于六月初再次收复后，外出商人已纷纷回来恢复营业。现该市商船往来频繁，生意兴隆，物价普遍下落，柴火、食盐等均下跌一倍有余。粮行每日售出粮食达五百余石。钟祥二次收复后，七月初行署主任郑绍文曾亲往指导城市恢复工作，并召开商民、教育、医生各界座谈会，到会代表二百余人。郑主任宣布民主政府切实保护工商业政策后，说明在此战争环境中保甲人员仍须继续办公，但必须忠实服从与执行民主政府法令，维持治安，不得阴谋破坏。各代表表示拥护。现该市市面已渐恢复常态。天门、岳口及汉水南岸之新沟咀、峰口等城镇工商业均已恢复，并已有相当发展。新沟咀原有工商业五三五家，解放前后外迁十一家，停业转业四十一家，从四月份下半月至六月初新开设的粉行、蛋行、机器制面、磨坊、货庄等共六十三家，又新开戏院一家，现共五四七家，较解放前增加十二家。该市初解放时被错误处理之工商业，民主政府已全部予以查点退回或赔偿。地主萧明珍点收他的榨房后，已正式复业，并正力谋扩大营业。峰口镇市面工商业已由四十家增加到一百零九家，尚有十五家正准备开业。被国民党军骗走的商民已有二百人回来重理旧业。
