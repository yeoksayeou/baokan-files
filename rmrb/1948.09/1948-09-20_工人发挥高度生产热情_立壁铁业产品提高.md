　　【Taihang Dispatch】The iron industry in Libi Village, Pindin County, has begun to prosper after its recovery. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were several iron furnaces in the village, operating individually. The workers only had tools and no capital, relying entirely on selling their labor to earn a living. During the Anti-Japanese War, the iron furnaces collapsed and workers lost their jobs due to Japanese destruction. After the Japanese surrender, the government provided a loan of 300,000 to help restore them. Initially, six furnaces were organized with 34 workers, producing on a small scale. However, due to poor technology, they could only make hoe blades and sales were limited, only selling in Yu County. Later, to expand sales, they developed the production of iron shovels, wrought iron shovels, and flower cart axles. Subsequently, sales expanded to Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Xingtai and other places, and production gradually increased. In just over a year, the number of furnaces increased from six to sixteen, and the number of workers increased to eighty. In the spring of 1947, Yan Xishan's troops caused widespread disruption, and the iron furnaces were once again forced to stop. After the liberation of Pindin City last year, the government again provided a loan of 30 shi of grain to help restore business, and established the Juxing Iron Factory. A manager was democratically elected, staff were assigned, and technicians were hired to train technical personnel. It quickly developed to nineteen furnaces, and the number of workers increased to eighty again. However, due to inconvenient transportation, sales were sluggish at the time, and production was affected by a lack of capital. Under these layers of difficulties, the workers still maintained a high level of production enthusiasm. Everyone agreed that they were not afraid of not having sales, but only afraid of not being able to make goods. As long as there was inventory, sales would open up and money could be earned. With the unanimous agreement of the employees, wages were temporarily not earned, and inventory was accumulated instead (because the factory was a labor-capital cooperative with profit sharing between labor and capital). From September last year to April this year, iron shovels, wrought iron plowshares for cultivated land, hoe blades, etc., and a batch of sundries were made. After selling these finished products, they were exchanged for oil, salt, cloth, etc. for sale. During this period, after deducting all expenses, a net profit of 13,070,000 yuan was earned. The main reasons for making money were: 1. The leadership took the lead. For example, Zhang Renfu, the chairman of the trade union, set an example, was able to endure hardship, and was not selfish. The workers had a high degree of production enthusiasm, were able to start from long-term interests, and were able to actively produce and accumulate finished products without earning wages in the most difficult circumstances. 2. Good management. They were able to grasp the economic situation, find production opportunities in many ways, and organically combine industry and commerce. For example, Yue Cunjin, the purchasing and sales agent, listened to what goods were fast-moving and what agricultural tools were needed, and then had the furnaces make them. The funds from the sale of iron goods were used for reproduction, buying daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth to transport to the local area. In addition to solving the needs of the workers, a part was sold to earn money again. 3. The workers' skills gradually improved, and the output became more and more numerous and better every day.

　　工人发挥高度生产热情
  　立壁铁业产品提高
    【太行电】平定立壁村的铁工业，经过恢复，已开始走向繁荣。该村抗战前就有几家铁炉，生产方式是个体经营，工人们只有工具没有资本，完全靠出卖劳力来获得生活资料。抗战期间由于日寇摧残，铁炉垮台，工人失业。日寇投降后，政府以三十万贷款扶助，又逐渐恢复起来。先组织六盘炉，工人三十四人，小规模的进行生产。但因技术差，只能打锄板，销路不广，仅能出售盂县一地。后为扩展销路，就发展到打铁锹，熟铁锹，轧花车轴等，以后销路推广到元氏、赞皇、邢台等地，生产日渐增加。一年多光景由六盘炉发展到十六盘，工人增加到八十人。一九四七年春阎顽大肆扰乱，铁炉又一度被迫停止。去年平定城解放，政府又以三十石贷粮扶助恢复营业，成立了聚兴铁厂，民选经理，配备职员，聘请技师培养技工人员，很快就发展到十九盘炉，工人又增至八十人。但因交通不便，当时销路不畅，资本缺乏，生产受到影响。在这层层困难下，工人们仍保持高度生产热忱，大家一致认为不怕没销路，只怕做不下货，只要有存货，销路一通，钱就能赚到手，在职工一致同意下，暂且不赚工资，往起存货（因该厂是劳资合作、劳资分红的工厂）。从去年九月到今年四月，制成铁锹、耕地熟铁铧、锄板等和一部杂货。出售这些成品后，换回油盐布等出售，这期间除了一切开支，净赚红利一千三百零七万余元。赚钱的主要原因是：一、领导起带头作用。如工会主席张仁福以身作则，能吃苦，不自私。工人有高度的生产热情，能从长远利益出发，在最困难的情况下能不赚工资，积极生产，积存成品。二、善于经营。能掌握经济情况，多方找生产门路，并使工商业有机结合，如采卖员岳存金在外，听那里什么货快、需要什么农具，就让炉上打什么。并将出售铁货的款用于再生产，买成油盐布等日用品运来本地，除解决工人需用外，出售一部，再入进去赚钱。三、工人的技术逐渐提高，出品一天比一天多而且好。
