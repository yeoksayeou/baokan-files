Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th, TASS New York, September 14th: In recent weeks, American newspapers have reflected the anxiety of some important business figures regarding the American economic situation. The New York Herald Tribune's financial observer stated: "In many quarters, a considerable degree of unease and doubt prevails regarding the economic outlook." The Citibank Bulletin admitted: "The cost of living is oppressively felt," and "People are eager for relief." The bulletin continued: "Entrepreneurs are uneasy about the economic situation; they fear that the longer the boom lasts, "the greater the reaction will be." Various articles in business and economic publications point out these weaknesses in the current situation: (1) The current high levels of production, employment, and prices are artificially created by military orders and Marshall Plan expenditures; (2) The high cost of living is suppressing living standards, thereby shrinking the domestic market; (3) Despite the injection of the Marshall Plan, export markets are in decline; (4) The cost of new factory equipment shows a downward trend; (5) Certain industrial sectors have shown signs of "overproduction" and have already begun to reduce work. According to the Federal Reserve Board's recent estimates, industrial production declined in July and partially recovered in August. The industrial production index for July was 187, compared to 192 in June (based on the average of 1935-39). The Department of Commerce reported that the total inventory of manufacturers in June reached $29.8 billion, an increase of $400 million in one month. Labor Department statistics conservatively state that the cost of living in July increased by 30.3 percent compared to June 1946, when price controls ended, and by 76.2 percent compared to August 1939. "The New Republic" magazine wrote regarding rising prices: "The simple but unpleasant explanation is that we have reached the point where the business community finds it more profitable to cut production than to lower prices." "The New Republic" magazine pointed out that total corporate after-tax profits this year will reach a new record of $20 billion, four times that of 1939. Statistics from the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies reveal that profits are increasingly concentrated in the hands of the largest companies. The export situation is beginning to cause some concern. In the first half of this year, total U.S. exports, including Marshall Plan materials, totaled $6.7 billion, a decrease of 17 percent compared to the first half of last year. If price increases are taken into account, this indicates a decrease of more than 20 percent in the quantity of exports. While exports are declining, U.S. imports in the first half of this year increased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year.

　　国内及输出市场都在衰退
  　美经济情势使资本家焦虑
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：最近几周来，美国报纸上反映着某些重要企业界人士对美国经济情势的焦虑。纽约先驱论坛报金融观察家说：许多方面人士对经济的前景流行着相当程度的不安和怀疑。花旗银行公报承认：“生活费用令人感到压迫”，“人民渴望减轻”。公报继称：企业家对景气感到不安，他们害怕景气的时间愈久，“反响就更大”。企业与经济刊物上的各种论文指出目前情势的这些弱点：（一）目前的生产、就业和物价的高水平，是军事定单和马歇尔计划开支所人为地造成的；（二）生活费用的高涨压抑着生活标准，从而缩小国内市场；（三）尽管有马歇尔计划的注射，输出市场已在衰退；（四）新工厂装备的费用显出下降的趋势；（五）某些工业部门已显露出“生产过剩”的迹象，已经开始减少工作。据联邦储备局最近的估计，工业生产七月份已下降，八月份有部分的恢复。七月份工业总生产量指数为一八七，六月份为一九二（按系以一九三五至三九年的平均数为基数）。商务部报告说：六月份制造家的存货总数达二百九十八亿元，即一个月内增加了四亿元。劳工部统计数字保守地说明：七月份生活费用较物价管制结束时的一九四六年六月增加了百分之三十点三，较一九三九年八月增加了百分之七十六点二。“新共和”杂志论及物价上涨时写道：“简单但不愉快的解释，就是我们已经达到这样的地步：企业界发现削减生产比降低物价更为有利。”“新共和”杂志指出：公司纳税后的利润总数今年将达二百亿元的新纪录，为一九三九年的四倍，联邦贸易委员会和其政府机关的统计透露利润愈来愈集中在最大的公司手中。输出的情形开始引起某些关心，今年上半年美国总输出，包括马歇尔计划物资在内，共计六十七亿元，即较去年上半年降低百分之十七，如算上物价的上涨，则表示输出的数量下降百分之二十以上，一方面输出下降，另一方面，美国的输入今年上半年比去年同一时期增加百分之二十。
