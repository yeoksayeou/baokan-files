Workers and the People's Liberation Army Jointly Protect
　　Taiyuan Electric Company, Maintaining Complete and Normal Power Supply Without Interruption for a Single Day
　　[Jinzhong News] At 9:00 PM on July 12th, the Yan bandit's 9th Column prepared to flee. The workers were still working as usual in the machine room. Two or three hours later, they received the news of the Yan bandits' escape. But they still did not shut off the power. The generator was still rotating at the same speed as before. It was not until 12:00 AM that they rested. Because the house had holes, the machine room workers covered the machines with tarpaulins to prevent them from rusting in the rain. They slept in the machine room all night, never leaving their old partner of more than ten years – the generator. On the same day, some individual workers, deceived by the Yan bandit's propaganda and not understanding our Party's policies, secretly hid in villages near the city; the next day, after our army entered the city, with strict discipline and peaceful order, they especially protected the power plant, and they automatically returned to work. The next day, as before, they started the machines, supplying light to the whole city, and all the staff worked hard. The light bulbs damaged by the Yan bandits before they fled were all repaired and installed by the workers with tireless efforts, rain or shine. Sometimes, if a problem occurred somewhere, as long as a phone call was made, no matter how late it was, the workers would come immediately to fix it, not letting it affect the work. Boiler worker Liu Jinbao said, "The boiler is my life, the factory is my home, how can I eat if I don't take good care of the machines!" Machine worker Hu Xiuwen said, "This machine and I have been old partners for thirteen years, it can't leave me, and I can't leave it. Now that our People's Liberation Army is here, I have never left the machine, even if I don't work during the day, I still have to come and see it." Then he excitedly said, "When Yan Xishan was in power, we simply couldn't survive. Our People's Liberation Army is very concerned about us and treats us very well. We must work hard from now on."
　　Although it has gone through two worlds, the machines of the electric company are still intact and working as usual. The lights of Taiyuan City have not been extinguished for a single day.

　　工人和解放军合力保护
  　太谷电灯公司完整照常供电未停一天
    【晋中讯】七月十二日下午九点钟，阎匪九纵队即做逃窜的准备。工人们还在机器房里照常工作。两三个钟头以后，他们才得到阎匪逃跑的消息。但他们仍未关电门。发电机仍和以前一样速度的转动着。直至十二点钟，才休息了。因房子破了窟窿，机器房工人用油布把机器盖好，以免下雨生锈。他们就在机器房内睡了下来。整夜没离开他们十多年来的老伙伴——发电机。当天有个别工人，因受阎匪欺骗宣传，不了解我党政策，偷偷躲藏到城附近的村里；第二天我军进城后，纪律严明，秩序安然，对电厂特别加以保护，他们又自动的返回来上工了。第二天仍和以前一样，开动着机器，供应着全城的光明，所有职工，都紧张的工作着。阎匪临跑时破坏了的电灯，经过工人们不辞辛劳，风雨无阻的收拾，又都安置好了。有时一个地方发生了毛病，只要打个电话，不管天如何晚，工人都马上来给收拾好，不让影响工作。烧锅炉工人柳金保说：“锅炉是我的命，工厂是我的家，不好好保存机器，怎样吃饭！”机器工人胡修文说：“我和这部机器已是十三年的老伙伴，它离不了我，我离不开它。咱解放军来了，我就没有离开机器，白天不工作，还要来看看它”。接着他又兴奋的说：“阎锡山在时，我们简直活不下去，咱解放军来了，对我们非常关心，对我们很好，以后可要好好干哩”。
    虽然经过了两个世界，但电灯公司的机器还是完整无缺，照常工作，太谷城的电灯，没有一天熄灭过。
