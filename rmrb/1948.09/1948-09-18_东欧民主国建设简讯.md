  　Brief News on Construction
    ◇ In Czechoslovakia, more than fifty large mines, factories, and manufacturing plants have completed their two-year plans. The draft of the Czech Five-Year Plan, scheduled to be implemented next year, has been completed and will soon be submitted to the parliament for approval. The total investment of the new Five-Year Plan will reach 33 billion Czech crowns, and its goal is to increase the level of industrial and agricultural production by 50 percent each compared to this year by 1953.
    ◇ Since the Czech new government promulgated the Second Nationalization Decree, by the end of July, 2,200 of the 2,700 enterprises that should be nationalized have been nationalized. To date, 4,300 enterprises employing 93 percent of all Czech workers and employees have been nationalized.
    ◇ Bulgaria's Two-Year Plan is progressing victoriously. In the first half of this year, industrial production exceeded the same period last year by 32 percent, and agricultural production exceeded by 20 percent. More than 350 new pastures were established in the first half of the year, and the people's milk supply was therefore 45 percent more than in the same period last year.
    ◇ Since the Fatherland Front came to power in Bulgaria four years ago, kindergartens have increased by 71, primary schools have increased by 207, incomplete secondary schools have increased by 667, complete secondary schools have doubled, universities have increased by three, and the number of students enrolled in higher education institutions has increased fourfold. The government has set up scholarships of 70 million Bulgarian levs for poor students.
    ◇ Poland recently announced that the proportion of state-owned industrial production in the total national industrial output in the final year of the Three-Year Plan (i.e., 1949) will increase by 20 to 23 percent compared to this year. Next year, pig iron production will increase by 2 percent, and coal production will increase by 20 percent to reach 74 million tons.
    ◇ Since Romania announced the nationalization decree in early June, industry has developed greatly, and various sabotage and slowdowns by capitalists have been curbed. As of August, the government's investment in industry has reached 35 billion Romanian lei.
    ◇ The Romanian government has ordered another reduction in the prices of food and consumer goods, train fares, and telephone charges, etc., starting from August 23rd. The prices of non-rationed goods sold in state-owned stores have been reduced by 20 percent, textiles have been reduced by 26 percent, and the price of meat in state-owned restaurants and food stores has been reduced by 30 percent. The Romanian government has declared that it will take all necessary measures to further reduce prices of all commodities by September 15th. (Xinhua News Agency)
