　　【Ji'zhong Telegraph】Since correcting the errors of infringing upon industry and commerce and revising industrial and commercial taxes, industry and commerce in the Ji'zhong Ninth Sub-district has become increasingly developed. During the land reform in the district, a total of 1,490 industrial and commercial households were infringed upon. After repeatedly implementing the Party's industrial and commercial policies and conducting in-depth explanations and education among cadres and the masses, the entire sub-district had corrected the issues for 1,235 households by June, with the remainder being corrected. At the same time, the shortcomings of excessively broad industrial and commercial tax burden or excessive burden were corrected. It was stipulated that the levy should not exceed 25% of net profit, and the share assessment was re-evaluated, changing the past erroneous practice of "taking small businesses as the backbone to unite medium-sized businesses" in the assessment of industrial and commercial taxes. Over-collected taxes were refunded. In order to prosper industry and commerce and facilitate the exchange of goods and materials, temple fairs were restored in various places. According to incomplete statistics from eleven counties, fifty temple fairs were restored. Among them, the trade volume of the An'guo temple fair alone reached 53 million yuan, with the Chinese medicine trade accounting for 24 million yuan. Local banks also issued loans and organized inter-bank transfers to vigorously support industrial and commercial households. For example, the An'guo City Bank supported 862 industrial and commercial households with loans. Among them, Fu Shun and Shuichepu, with the help of bank loans, obtained a net profit of 1 million yuan in three months and doubled their capital. Public factories and shops in various places also actively helped private industrial and commercial households develop. For example, the iron factory of the sub-district Industrial Corporation produced a large number of waterwheel parts for private factories. The Suning Pingyuan Iron Factory supplied raw materials and capital to private factories, which provided great convenience to industrial and commercial households.
    (Editor's note: When providing loans, more should be lent to industry, and less or none to commerce, because industry produces social products; commerce does not produce products, but only completes commodity circulation. Therefore, industry should be valued over commerce. Undifferentiated lending to both industry and commerce is inappropriate.)
    Under the multifaceted support of the democratic government, industry and commerce in the sub-district became increasingly developed. According to August statistics, among the 2,490 households that were infringed upon, after correcting the deviations and returning wrongly confiscated items, 1,235 households had resumed business. Many new industrial and commercial households were also added in various places. Dingxian County's industry increased from 111 households to 146 households, and commerce added 73 new households. Gaoyang County's industry increased from 86 households to 106 households. The Gaoyang weaving industry has gradually recovered. The number of looms has increased from 500 before the land reform to 3,033. The white paper making industry in Qiaoshangpu, Suning County, has increased to 200 households, producing more than five reams of paper per day. After the resumption of business, the nationally renowned Bai Jingyu Eye Medicine Shop in Dingxian County has found its products in short supply.

　　端正政策整顿负担
  　冀中九分区工商业日益发展
    【冀中电】冀中九分区，自纠正侵犯工商业的错误及重订工商税以后，工商业日益发达。该区于土改中，共侵犯了一千四百九十户工商业。经过反复贯彻党的工商业政策，并在干部、群众中进行了深入的解释教育后，全分区到六月份已纠正了一千二百卅五户，其余正在继续纠正。同时纠正了工商税负担面太宽或负担过重的缺点，并规定征收不超过纯利百分之二十五，和重新评定了厘股，改变了过去“以小商为骨干团结中商”评议工商税的错误作法。对征收过重的实行了还补。为了繁荣工商业，便于物资交流，各地又恢复了庙会，据十一个县不完全统计，恢复庙会达五十个。其中只安国庙会交易额即达五万三千余万元，其中生药行占二万四千万元。各地银行并发放贷款、举办通支，大力扶植工商业户。如安国市银行以贷款扶植的工商户即有八百六十二户。其中在银行贷款帮助下的福顺与水车铺在三个月中得到纯利一百万元，并扩大资金两倍。各地公营工厂商店，也积极帮助私营工商户发展，如分区实业公司铁厂造出大批水车零件供给私人工厂。肃宁平原铁厂供给私营工厂原料、资本等，都给了工商户很大方便。
    （编者按：贷款时应工业多贷，商业少贷或不贷，因工业生产社会产品的；商业不生产产品，只尽商品流通后，故对工业应重视商业。工商不分，平均贷给是不妥的。）
    在民主政府多方扶植下，该分区工商业日益发达。据八月份统计，被侵犯的二千四百九十户中，经过纠正偏向，退回错斗东西后，已有一千二百三十五户复业，各地并新增不少工商户。定县工业由一百一十一户增到一百四十六户，商业新增加了七十三户。高阳工业由八十六户增到一百零六户。高阳织布业已逐渐恢复。织布机已由土改前五百张增至三千零三十三张。肃宁桥上铺白造纸业已增至二百户。每日出纸五余刀。定县全国驰名的白敬宇眼药铺厂复业后，所制成品供不应求。
