Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch of August 28th, the "Shanghai Student Federation," which is persisting in underground struggle, denounced the Kuomintang's frantic atrocities of arresting students in its mimeographed organ "Student Newspaper." The paper pointed out: The Kuomintang "oppresses and persecutes patriotic students because they launched a movement against American support for Japan." It also stated: "The Special Criminal Tribunal is illegal, and human rights have been disregarded." In addition, according to an August 20th Tianjin Minguo Daily news report: Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University and other schools in Peiping have successively protested and accused the Kuomintang of the crime of arresting students in wall posters. "There are still many wall posters on the Democracy Wall of Peking University, all of which are statements protesting the authorities' measures." Yenching University students are still publishing wall posters, reporting the situation of various schools on that day, and there are also many wall posters within the Normal University.

  　抗议逮捕暴行
    【新华社陕北三日电】据合众社上海八月二十八日电，坚持地下斗争的“上海学联”在其油印机关刊物“学生报”上斥责国民党疯狂逮捕学生的暴行。该报指出：国民党“压迫与迫害爱国学生，因为他们曾发动反对美国扶日运动。”并称：“特种刑事法庭是非法的，人权已被置于不顾。”另据八月二十日天津民国日报消息：北平北大、清华、师院、燕大等校学生，纷纷在壁报中抗议并控诉国民党逮捕学生的罪行。“北大民主墙上壁报仍多，均系抗议当局此种措施之言论。”燕大学生仍出版壁报，报告当日各校情形，师院校内壁报亦不少。
