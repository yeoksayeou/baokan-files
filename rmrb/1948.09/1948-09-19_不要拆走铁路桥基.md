　　Do Not Remove Railway Bridge Foundations

　　To the Editors:
    On August 26th, I passed by the Pinghan Railway northwest of Ding County and saw people dismantling and removing the original railway foundation stones. I asked them, "If you take these home, won't the government care?" They said, "What does the government need these for?" I think the local government should stop these things, otherwise, when we rebuild the railway, it will cost a lot of money and manpower, which is very uneconomical. I passed through several places to the north, and the same thing was happening. I hope the government and the masses will protect the transportation in the liberated areas and stop this from happening.

　　不要拆走铁路桥基编辑同志：
    八月二十六日，我经过定县城西北平汉路，见有群众正在拆毁搬走原有铁路基石。我问他们：“你们拆回家政府不管吗？”他们说：“政府还要这个干什么。”我觉得当地政府应当制止这些事，不然，我们重建铁路时将重费许多金钱人力，很不合算。我向北经过数处，都有同样事情在发生着。望政府及群众爱护解放区交通，停止此事发生。  佟坡
