The liberated women of the Third Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan demonstrated a high degree of heroism, tenacity, and unyielding spirit in the long-term struggles against "mopping-up operations," "encirclement and suppression," supporting the front, and production. They used blood, sweat, and wisdom to defeat the enemy.

(1) Before the wheat harvest, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits swept through Shibeiji Village in Jinxiang County, capturing the family of Village Chief Li Jixie. They subjected them to severe torture, demanding to know where the village cadres had gone and where the grain was hidden. She only cursed them vehemently. The bandit soldiers cut open her mouth with a knife, but she remained heroically unyielding. She did not say a word about the public grain. The bandit soldiers then subjected her to electric shock. After she passed out and regained consciousness, the evil bandit soldiers cut off her two nipples, but she still did not utter a word. The bandit soldiers left the half-dead Village Chief Li's family in the square. Then, they captured the family of clerk Zeng Guangtai. The bandit soldiers first showed her the condition of the village chief's family and asked her who the village cadres were. She was as resolute as the village chief's family. Her entire body was beaten to a pulp, but she still did not say a word. The bandit soldiers then captured a child and cut off all of its hands and feet with a knife! The child did not reveal a single grain of public grain. The bandit soldiers returned to interrogate Village Chief Li's family, but still could not get a single word out of them. The bandit soldiers then executed her and the child. Next, the bandit soldiers turned to the clerk's family: "You are truly a Communist devotee!" The clerk's family cursed loudly, "You cowardly troops, I am a Communist devotee. I will tell my child to join the Communist army when he grows up! Beat to death you cowardly troops!" The bandit soldiers then executed her. Then, they captured people to interrogate, and beat thirteen people to death (including four women). The bandit soldiers never got the grain or the village cadres. They only saw the people's heroism and sacrifice!

(2) The women's association chairperson of Xin Yangmiao in Caoliu District, Danxian County, after being captured by the bandit soldiers, frankly admitted that she was the women's association chairperson, but said nothing about other matters. The bandit soldiers asked her, "Why did you become the chairperson?"

"To liberate ourselves!"

"What else?" the bandit soldiers asked again.

"To avoid oppression!"

After beating her for a day, the bandit soldiers asked again, "Do you still want to liberate yourselves?"

She gritted her teeth and said, "Liberate! Liberate!!"

The bandit soldiers, in order to make her betray other cadres, pushed her into a pit and threatened to bury her alive, but she did not betray a single person. The enemy was helpless in the face of her righteousness.

(3) A women's federation member in Ximatai Village, Danxian County, allowed her house to be deliberately collapsed to cover the entrance of a cellar, sheltering the shells and machine guns stored there. The bandit soldiers beat her to the point of death twice, but she never confessed. The materials were not lost.

(4) In supporting the front and production, the men went to the front lines, and the women did all the work in the rear. They never lagged behind in anything. For example, last autumn, thirty young women in Xulukou Village, Huangdui District, Danxian County, harvested all the soybeans in the village on time. The old ladies all said, "If it weren't for these sisters-in-law, the crops would have been left in the fields." Women in Caoma District and Ximalou Village did all the work of grinding rice, carrying bags, and loading vehicles during the Longhai Campaign last autumn. After loading the vehicles, they sent old men to deliver them. Some women even led the way for our army at night. (Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch)

　　金乡单县妇女坚贞不屈
  　英勇反抗蒋匪暴行
    冀鲁豫三分区翻身妇女在长期的反“扫荡”、反“清剿”、支前、生产等工作中，表现了高度英勇顽强和坚贞不屈的气节。她们用血、汗、智谋，战胜了敌人。
    （一）麦前蒋匪扫荡金乡县石北集村，将村长李继偕家拉住，严刑拷打，追问村干那里去了？粮食在什么地方？她只是破口大骂，匪军用刀把她的嘴割开，她仍英勇不屈。关于公粮一句不说，匪军们又对她过电刑，她死过去醒来后，万恶的匪军又把她的两个乳头割去，她仍一字未吐。就这样匪军把半死不活的李村长家放在广场上。接着又抓来文书曾广太家，匪军首先叫她看村长家，又问她村干是谁？她和村长家一样的顽强，浑身的肉被打烂了，仍一个字也不说。匪军又抓来一个小孩，把手脚全用刀割去！小孩没有供出一粒公粮。匪军又重来审问村长家，结果仍得不出一句话，匪军便把她及小孩都枪决了。接着匪军转向文书家“你真是八路迷”文书家大骂道：“你孬种队伍，我是八路迷，俺小孩长大也叫他干八路！打死您这孬种队伍！”匪军便又把她枪决了。然后又抓人审问，一直打死了十三个人（其中四个妇女）匪军始终没得到粮食和村干。只看到了人民的英勇，壮烈！
    （二）单县蔡溜区辛羊庙妇女会长，被匪军抓住后、她自己除坦然承认妇女会长外，其他的事情一点也不说。匪军问她：“为啥当会长？”
    “为翻身！”
    “还为啥”？匪军又问
    “为的不受压迫！”
    匪军打了他一天后，又问：“还翻身不？”
    她咬着牙说：“翻！翻！！”
    匪军为使他供出别的干部，把她推到坑里，以活埋威胁，但她仍一个人也没供出，敌人在她凛然大义前毫无办法。
    （三）单县西马台村一个妇联会员，把她的屋子抓歪压住地洞口，掩护地洞里存着的炮弹和机枪，匪军把她打的死去两次，终未供出。物资毫无损失。
    （四）在支前与生产中，男人上前线，后方的事情全是妇女干。他们一切都不落后，如去年秋天，单县黄堆区徐路口村三十个青年妇女，将全村的豆子都按时收到家来。老太太都说“不是这些嫂子们的话，庄稼都得丢在地里。”曹马区、西马楼村妇女在去秋陇海战役时碾米扛口袋装车，全由妇女干，装好车，再派老头去送。还有的妇女夜晚替我军带路。（冀鲁豫电）
