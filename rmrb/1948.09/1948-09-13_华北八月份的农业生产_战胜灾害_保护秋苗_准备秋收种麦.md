　　Agricultural Production in North China in August
    ——Overcoming Disasters, Protecting Autumn Crops, Preparing for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
    [Report from this newspaper] Overcoming disasters, protecting autumn seedlings, and preparing for the autumn harvest and wheat planting are the central themes of agricultural production in the North China Liberated Area in August, and great achievements have been made in various places. The entire region has suffered various disasters to varying degrees. In mid-July, drought turned into flooding. Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, Taihang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Northern Yue regions all suffered from floods, especially Southern Hebei. According to statistics from the first, second, third, and fourth special districts of the region, 4,268,456 mu of land were flooded, accounting for more than one-eighth of the cultivated area of the entire region. Seedlings were completely submerged, resulting in no harvest on 698,000 mu of land, and 1,411 villages were affected by the disaster. The second is insect pests, which have been found to include locusts, armyworms, aphids, rice insects, white moths, etc. The insect pest area in Southern Hebei has spread from 14 counties to 41 counties, and autumn crops have been greatly damaged. In Central Hebei, more than 3,000 villages in 27 counties have suffered from insect pests. In the most severely affected Shulu County, 70% of the crops were damaged. According to statistics from ten counties in Taihang, locust plagues damaged 25,000 mu of autumn seedlings. Insect pests were also found in some areas of 14 counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. In addition, Taihang, Taiyue, Southern Chahar, Northern Yan, and other places have successively suffered from hail disasters. According to statistics from nine counties in Taihang, 32,000 mu of crops were damaged. According to hail disaster statistics from Qinyuan Anze and other five counties in the first district of Taiyue, a total of about 15,000 to 20,000 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed. Based on the above situation, leaders in various places urgently called on the masses to carry out flood prevention, pest control, replanting, and seedling protection. In terms of flood prevention and water management, the Hebei Central and Southern Hebei Administrative Offices have successively convened special flood prevention meetings. Each county has established a flood prevention headquarters or flood prevention committee. Major cadres personally went to the flooded areas to lead the masses in rushing to repair breaches and dredging and reinforcing embankments. In Pingxiang County, Southern Hebei, more than 2,000 zhang of dangerous works were repaired in three days. In various places in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, rivers were dredged and drained in advance. 1,500 qing of farmland were rescued on both sides of the Xiao River, and 1,000 qing of autumn seedlings were protected. Currently, the masses are continuing to be organized to protect embankments and prevent dangers, and the Tuhai River in Gaotang territory is being dredged, completing 160,000 cubic meters of earthwork in ten days. The Taihang and Northern Henan county governments organized the masses to rush to repair the breaches. Within a week, all the breaches in the Qin River, Mang River, Guangji River, Yunliang River, Qi River, Anyang River, Dan River, Fuyang River, and Wei River were blocked, and more than 30 qing of wasteland were opened up for disaster victims, most of which were planted with autumn vegetables. Raoyang County in Central Hebei also blocked all 44 water holes and 689 animal holes in the Hutuo River embankment in a short period of time. Currently, except for Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which are continuing to dredge and drain rivers, the floods in other areas have been overcome. In terms of pest control, party and government agencies in various affected areas are vigorously organizing, and some areas have already achieved victories. The locust plague in 17 counties in Taihang and Northern Henan was quickly eradicated due to the region's experience in locust eradication in 1944. Southern Hebei is currently launching a region-wide pest control campaign. Ideological mobilization and organizational guarantees have overcome the superstition, disorganization, and paralysis of some of the masses. Pest control teams have been formed in Pingxiang and other places. In Aixing Village alone, 1,698 jin of insects were captured in one day. In Yixian, Mancheng, Tangxian, Wanxian, Xushui and other counties in Western Hebei, after the discovery of insect pests, county and district cadres rushed to the affected areas to lead the masses in capturing and beating them. In Lingnan Village, Yixian County, men, women, old and young were mobilized to rescue 112 mu of autumn seedlings in four days. In the hail-stricken areas, in addition to allocating grain for relief, the government mainly organized the masses to replant late autumn crops, calling on the masses to help each other and engage in production for self-rescue. The Central Hebei Administrative Office allocated 1.8 million jin of loans and disaster relief grain, and organized cooperatives, promotion societies, and state-owned stores in various counties to go to the disaster areas to help the masses in production, proposing "different production methods for different regions." Renqiu County organized 31 villages including Liangou to fish, and Anping County Promotion Society purchased 22 dan of various vegetable seeds. State-owned stores allocated 6,000 jin of cotton to supply disaster victims for replanting and weaving. Jinghai even organized more than 4,000 disaster victims to dig ground pears in Wen'anwa. In various disaster areas in Taihang, the experience of overcoming famine in 1942 and 1943 was carried forward, and various sideline productions were carried out. According to statistics from 73 villages in 9 counties including Pingding, Huguan, and Xiyang, sideline production has earned more than 24 million yuan and 898 shi of rice, wheat, and sorghum in the past month. In addition, cadres and the masses in various places have also launched a movement to save and prepare for famine.
    In non-disaster areas and areas with less severe disasters, the government vigorously led the masses to hoe and topdress to increase production. The Taiyue Administrative Office specially issued 30,000 yuan in topdressing and wheat planting loans, mobilizing labor heroes, production models, and mutual aid team leaders to take the lead in implementing three hoeings and topdressing. A campaign to supplement fertilizer and hoe seedlings was launched in various parts of Taihang. Li Shunda's exemplary action in leading the hoeing and topdressing of seedlings in Pingshun promoted the universal three hoeings and topdressing in the county. According to statistics from 83 villages in the county, 40% of the 85,457 mu of autumn fields in 1,144 mutual aid teams were hoeed three times and universally topdressed. Among them, 31,000 mu of cotton have been hoeed four times.
    In addition, preparations are being made for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In terms of the autumn harvest, Taihang, Taiyue, Northern Yue and other regions have successively issued instructions, concentrating efforts to organize and lead during the autumn harvest period, especially in the border areas, where labor and military should be combined to actively attack the enemy and smash the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain. The Taihang Administrative Office and Military Region have jointly issued an autumn protection order. In the border areas such as Northern Henan, militia cadres are being trained and the autumn protection work is being specifically arranged. As for wheat planting preparation, arrangements have been made in various places early. The Taihang Third Special Office instructed various counties and farms to conduct in-depth research in rural areas on the causes of wheat diseases this year, and find seeds suitable for local soil and climate for the masses to sow. Pingshan, Huolu and other counties in Northern Yue are repairing and dredging various canals in order to provide shade for wheat planting after autumn. Most areas of Southern Hebei are actively reclaiming wasteland in preparation for expanding wheat fields. In Guangping's first and second districts alone, more than 20 qing of wasteland have been opened up. In addition, great achievements have been made in fertilizer accumulation in various places. Jinan Fourth District in Taiyue has accumulated 967 carts of manure, another 3,652 dan, cut more than 43,000 bundles of Artemisia annua, purchased 31,200 jin of sesame cakes, and prepared 295 mu of sheep bedding land.
    The achievements made in agricultural production in August in various places are closely related to the fact that various places have corrected policies, corrected deviations, concentrated on training village cadres, consolidated districts, and clearly declared the end of land reform. After training, village cadres in various places clarified the purpose of land reform and party rectification, and production work improved with the improvement of cadres' morale. In addition, some areas have rectified cooperatives and mutual aid societies, which have also played a significant role in promoting production.

　　华北八月份的农业生产
    ——战胜灾害·保护秋苗·准备秋收种麦
    【本报讯】战胜灾害保护秋苗与准备秋收种麦，为华北解放区八月份农业生产之中心课题，各地均已获得很大成绩。全区均遭程度不同的各种灾害，七月中旬转早为涝，冀南、冀中、太行、冀鲁豫及北岳等区均遭水灾，尤以冀南为最，据该区一、二、三、四四个专区统计，被淹地四百廿六万八千四百五十六亩，占全区耕地面积八分之一强，小苗被淹全无收成者达六十九万八千亩，被灾村达一千四百一十一村。其次是虫灾，已发现者有蝗虫、黏虫、蚜虫、稻虫、白蛾虫等，冀南虫灾区已由十四县蔓延至四十一县，秋禾大受损伤。冀中廿七县三千余村遭虫灾，最严重之束鹿县禾苗被咬坏十分之七。太行蝗灾，据十县统计，损坏秋苗二万五千亩。冀鲁豫区亦有十四个县部分地区发现虫灾。此外太行、太岳、察南、雁北等地先后遭雹灾，据太行九个县统计，打坏庄稼三万二千亩，据太岳一分区沁源安泽等五县雹灾统计，共打毁秋苗约一万五千亩到两万亩。根据上述情况，各地领导上紧急号召群众进行防汛、灭虫、补种保苗斗争。在防汛治水方面，冀中、冀南两行署曾先后专门召开防汛会议，各县成立防汛指挥部或防汛委员会，各主要干部亲赴泛区，率领群众抢险堵口、浚河培堤，冀南平乡县三天即修好二千多丈长险工。冀鲁豫各地，事先疏河排水，硝河两岸救出田地一千五百顷，保住千顷秋苗。现正继续组织群众拥堤防险，并将高唐境内之徒骇河浚好，十天完成了十六万方土工程。太行豫北各县政府，组织群众抢险，终在不满一周的时间内，把沁河、漭河、广济河、运粮河、淇河、安阳河、丹河、滏阳河及卫河上百处决口全部堵住，并组织灾民开熟荒三十余顷，大部种上秋菜。冀中饶阳县亦于短期内，将滹沱河堤水洞四十四个，兽穴六百八十九个全部堵死。现除冀南、冀中、冀鲁豫仍继续浚河排水外，其它地区之水灾已形克服。在扑灭虫害方面，各受害区党政机关正大力组织，并已有部分地区取得胜利，太行豫北等地十七县之蝗灾，由于该区发挥了一九四四年剿蝗经验，蝗灾迅速得到扑灭。冀南全区现正展开全区性的灭虫运动，以思想动员与组织保证克服了某些群众的迷信、涣散与麻痹等现象，平乡等地组成捕虫队，仅艾辛一村，一天即捕虫一千六百九十八斤。冀西易县、满城、唐县、完县、徐水等县，自发现虫害后，各县县区干部即赶到各受灾区，率领群众捕打，易县岭南村男女老少齐动员，四天救出秋苗一百一十二亩。在各雹灾区，政府除拨粮救济外，主要是组织群众补种晚秋作物，号召群众互济互助，生产自救。冀中行署拨发贷粮赈粮一百八十万斤外，并组织各县合作社、推进社及公营商店，到灾区去扶助群众生产，提出“不同地区组织不同生产门路”。任邱县组织梁沟等三十一村捕鱼，安平县推进社购买各种菜籽二十二石。公营商店拨出棉花六千斤，供给灾民补种和纺织。静海更组织四千余灾民到文安洼去挖地梨。太行各灾区，发扬一九四二、四三年渡荒经验，进行各种副业生产，据平定、壶关、昔阳等九县七十三个村统计，月来副业生产共赚钱二千四百余万元，米麦和高粱八百九十八石。此外，各地干部群众还展开了节约备荒运动。
    各非灾区和受灾较轻地区，政府大力领导群众多锄上追肥，以增加产量。太岳行署特发放追肥及种麦贷款三万万元，发动劳动英雄、生产模范、互助组长等带头，贯彻三锄上追肥。太行各地展开了补肥锄苗运动。平顺李顺达领导锄苗上追肥的模范行动，推动了全县普遍三锄与上追肥，据该县八十三个村统计，一千一百四十四个互助组共有秋田八万五千四百五十七亩，就有百分之四十锄了三遍，并普遍上了追肥。其中三万一千亩棉花已锄了四遍。
    此外则为准备秋收种麦。在秋收方面，太行、太岳、北岳等区，均先后发出指示，在秋收期间，集中力量进行组织与领导，特别在边沿区，要劳武结合，主动进攻敌人，粉碎敌人的抢粮阴谋，太行行署与军区已联合发出保秋令。豫北等边沿区，正集训民兵干部，具体布置保秋工作。至于种麦准备，各地亦早有布置，太行三专署指示各县及农场，深入农村研究今年小麦病害原因，找出适合各地土质气候之种籽供群众播种。北岳平山、获鹿等县正修浚各水渠，以便秋后荫地种麦，冀南大部地区积极垦荒，准备扩大麦田，仅广平一二两区，即已开出荒地二十余顷。此外，各地积肥工作亦获很大成绩，仅太岳晋城四区即已积粪九百六十七车，另三千六百五十二担，割青蒿四万三千多捆，购麻饼三万一千二百斤，卧羊地二百九十五亩。
    各地能在八月农业生产中获得如许成绩，与各地端正政策，纠正偏向集训村干巩固区明确宣布土改结束等有密切关系，各地村干经集训后，明确了土改整党目的，生产工作随干部情绪之提高而提高，其它还有些地区进行了整顿合作社与互助社，亦给生产的推进起了不少作用。
