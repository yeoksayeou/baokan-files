　　Agricultural College of China University
  　Studies Improved Farm Tools
    [Changzhi News] The Agricultural College of China University accepted the government's task of researching agricultural tools last winter. Technicians such as Hunter Yangzao began work, producing eight kinds of improved farm tools, which have been handed over to the masses at the college's work stations for trial use. In early July, Mr. Wang Chaojie, director of the Jinling University Agricultural Tool Factory, arrived at the college to design sugar industry tools, purchase raw materials, and modify power. Construction officially began on "August 1st." More than ten undergraduate students from the Department of Agricultural Machinery of the college are participating in the work. More than twenty sugar cane grinding machines are now under construction and will be completed by early November, for sale to the masses at various work stations for winter sugar production. The college has also applied to the government to modify tractors to use coal instead of gasoline. All modification materials are now prepared. If they can be installed by next spring, the college can replace the masses in plowing and other labor, which will save a lot of manpower. (Kang Xin)
