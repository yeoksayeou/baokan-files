Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The Kuomintang's farcical play about Kang Ze's "heroic martyrdom" has finally gone bankrupt in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, because the truth about Kang Ze's capture has spread everywhere, and even Nanjing's iron-clad blockade cannot stop it. Although the Shanghai Observer Weekly, published on August 7, still carried a Hankou dispatch entitled "Record of Kang Ze's Martyrdom," the New Road Weekly of Peiping, published on the same day, also carried a Hankou dispatch saying: "Initially, Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi (the so-called 'Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression') announced that Kang Ze had sacrificed himself for the country, and the Nanjing authorities also acknowledged this. However, later the newspapers suddenly revealed that Kang Ze might have been captured. On the 27th (July), Commander-in-Chief Bai also revealed the news of Kang Ze's capture when he visited Kang Ze's family in Nanjing." The Nanjing dispatch in the Peiping World Daily on September 6 further revealed the inside story: "Wang Lingji (the current chairman of Sichuan Province), when he came to Nanjing to ask for instructions on Sichuan's affairs, told his friends that Pan Wenhua (the current 'Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression') received a letter in mid-August from Guo Xunqi, deputy commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, stating that he and Kang Ze were both safe and sound, and asked friends in Sichuan to be relieved. The memorial service for Kang Ze's martyrdom was originally planned to be held in Nanjing, but it was shelved because of this." In fact, not only Guo Xunqi wrote letters, but also Kang Ze himself. On August 16, among the letters dropped by Kuomintang planes captured by the People's Liberation Army near Changchun, there was a letter from a military officer named Qi from Suzhou to Zheng Dongguo, which said: "After Kang Zhaomin (Kang Ze's courtesy name) was captured in Xiangyang, he also admitted that national affairs are everyone's business, and there is no personal grudge between individuals (?).... These words spoken by Brother Kang are generally believed to show his deep understanding of the true meaning of the civil war (?)." Although Kang Ze was talking nonsense here, he exposed the even bigger nonsense about Kang Ze's "martyrdom." Kang Ze's "martyrdom" is one of the countless rumors fabricated by the Kuomintang. The reason why the Kuomintang has made such great efforts to promote this rumor is that Jiang Jieshi's "confidant" Kang Ze has safely become a prisoner, which is a serious blow to the fighting will of all the Kuomintang's defending generals and combat troops. The officers of the Kuomintang army are now seeing more and more clearly that there is no future in their fighting, and they are generally preparing to become prisoners.

### 康泽被俘真相流传蒋区　国民党的滑稽宣传破产

　　康泽被俘真相流传蒋区
  　国民党的滑稽宣传破产
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】国民党宣传所谓康泽“壮烈殉职”的滑稽剧终于在国民党统治区破产，因为康泽被俘的真相已经到处流传，甚至南京官方铁桶似的封锁也无法阻止。尽管八月七日出版的上海观察周刊还登载着“康泽殉职记”的汉口通信，但是同月同日出版的北平新路周刊同样发自汉口的通信却已经说：“起初，白崇禧总司令（所谓‘华中剿匪总司令’）宣布，康泽已经杀身成仁，南京的官方也如此承认，但后来报纸上又忽然透露出康泽可能被俘。二十七日（七月）白总司令在南京慰问康泽家属时，也曾透露过康泽被俘的消息。”九月六日北平世界日报载南京专电进一步揭开了这一内幕：“王陵基（现任四川省主席）此次来京请示川政时，曾告其友人谓：潘文华（现任‘华中剿匪副总司令’）于八月中获十五绥靖区副司令官郭勋祺函称：彼与康泽均尚安全，请川中友好释念。京中人士原拟为康泽殉职举行追悼会，因此乃搁浅。”事实上写信出去的不但有郭勋祺，而且有康泽自己。八月十六日，长春近郊解放军缴获国民党飞机投落的信件中，有一封署名奇的军官从苏州写给郑洞国的信就说：“康兆民（康泽字）在襄阳被俘后亦承认国家大事，乃大家之事，个人之间并无恩怨（？）………此语在康兄口中道出，一般人认为其深能了解内战之真义（？）也。”康泽在这里虽然说的是鬼话，但是却拆穿了所谓康泽“殉职”的更大的鬼话。康泽“殉职”是国民党所制造的无数谣言之一。国民党所以特别努力宣传这个谣言，是因为蒋介石的“心腹”康泽安然做了俘虏，是对于国民党一切守城将领和作战军队的战斗意志的严重打击。国民党军队的军官现在一天比一天更加看清了他们作战是没有前途的，他们普遍地准备着做俘虏。
