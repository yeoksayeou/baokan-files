　　Kuomintang-Controlled Areas
  　News in Brief on the Workers' Movement
    ▲After the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Kaifeng, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang forced railway workers to repair the Bian-Zheng section of the Longhai Railway, paying each person only 4 million yuan in Chiang currency per month. More than 4,000 railway workers in Kaifeng, unable to maintain their livelihoods, went on strike on July 19 to protest.
    ▲Public buses in Beiping City were completely suspended on August 12 due to losses. Company employees, having no prior knowledge of this, decided to refuse the meager severance pay (calculated at a base of 700,000 multiplied by two months' salary). On the 13th, they held a general meeting, issued a written statement, and petitioned the municipal government.
    ▲In early August, the Pingjin Railway Workers' Union approached the bureau and sent a telegram to the puppet Ministry of Communications, demanding that real goods be distributed to Pingjin public servants and teachers monthly according to regulations. Furthermore, employees of the Changxindian Machine Factory on the Pinghan Railway have recently also requested the bureau and the puppet Ministry of Communications to adjust their compensation.
    ▲More than 300 workers at the Hangu Factory of the bureaucratic capital China Salt Company went on a work slowdown for two days on July 13 and 14 because the factory refused to adjust their compensation. The general compensation for workers in small private factories in Hangu is about 13 or 14 catties of corn per day, while the wages at China Salt are less than 5 catties of corn.
    ▲Employees of five major department stores in Shanghai, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, and China National Products Company, as well as more than ten units, including department stores and shops on Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, and Sichuan Road, went on a work slowdown in early July because the capitalists refused to fulfill the regulation to increase the base salary by 10 yuan at the end of last year. The China National Products Company was unable to open for business on July 1, and the situation remained deadlocked as of July 7.
    ▲Shanghai Western-style woodworking workers, facing soaring prices and difficult living conditions, made three demands to the capitalists: wages calculated according to the current month's index, tools provided by the factory, and wages paid weekly. When the capitalists refused, the workers held a joint strike on July 11.
    ▲All employees of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau demanded improved compensation and petitioned the puppet Ministry of Finance without result. On July 29, they held an employee representative meeting and decided to go on strike for three days starting on the 30th to protest.
