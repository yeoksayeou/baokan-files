　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd. The Women's Committee of the Jin Sui Sub-bureau of the Chinese Communist Party convened its first women's work conference since the land reform in the border region in late July. More than 30 women cadres at all levels, female labor heroes, and activists in land reform attended the meeting. The meeting unanimously agreed that in mobilizing the masses, as long as the leadership pays attention to mobilizing women, they will exert their strength and enthusiasm in various activities, increase the strength of the movement, and produce many female activists who will lead women to participate in various political and economic activities. However, in many areas at present, women have been mobilized, but the effort has not been sustained; some areas have not been mobilized at all, resulting in great losses to the work. The meeting determined that the main tasks of women's work in the future are: (1) Continue to mobilize women to participate in production, mainly agricultural production, followed by various household sideline productions, such as weaving, raising livestock, and poultry. Organize various forms of labor exchange and mutual assistance for women, commend and reward diligent women, and criticize and educate women who do not work. (2) Mobilize women to participate in various political activities. In party rectification, mobilize women to participate, cultivate and develop female party members; publicize the Party's various propositions on women, such as land ownership, property inheritance rights, freedom of marriage, and democratic freedom to participate in social activities. Ensure the establishment of women's committee members in the re-elected and newly established branch committees. In democratic political construction, mobilize women to participate in democratic elections, ensure that there are a certain number of female representatives in the People's Representative Conference and that they are elected as government committee members. Mobilize women to participate in the mobilization for joining the army and participating in the war, and enhance women's enthusiasm for supporting the front.
