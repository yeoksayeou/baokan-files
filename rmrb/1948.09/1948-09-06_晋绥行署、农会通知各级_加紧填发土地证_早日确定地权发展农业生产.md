Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 3rd. In the Jin-Sui liberated areas, the feudal land system has been eliminated and land reform has been completed in most areas. In order to determine land rights and develop agricultural production as soon as possible, the Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association issued a public notice on August 20, stipulating that villages where the majority of the masses have no objection to the distributed land, it should be considered that the land has been well distributed. All efforts should be made to restore and develop production, and land reform should no longer be carried out. County governments and farmers' associations at all levels are instructed to expedite the issuance of land certificates, determine land rights as soon as possible, and protect the land and property of all classes of people in accordance with the law. The Jin-Sui Administrative Office and the Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association also issued a notice on the issuance of land certificates, pointing out that this is the most important thing for developing production after land reform. Governments, representative conferences, and farmers' associations at all levels should widely and deeply publicize the significance of issuing land certificates among villagers, and earnestly and responsibly lead and expedite the issuance. The following points should be noted when issuing land certificates:
    1. The village government committee should personally lead the work of issuing land certificates and entrust the land distribution committee selected in the past land reform to be responsible for carrying it out. First, review the land distribution situation, allow farmers to raise different opinions on the land distribution situation, and solve them. The land that was not fully distributed locally last year should be distributed in full. Farmers are allowed to voluntarily exchange land for the convenience of cultivation. After reaching a unified opinion on the distribution of land, it should be announced to the villagers, discussed by the masses, and all original and newly distributed old contracts should be taken back and burned in public before issuing new land certificates.
    2. Before the land certificate is issued, a draft should first be filled out by household, and after carefully proofreading it household by household, it should be officially filled out in regular script with ink. Cursive or simplified characters shall not be used. After filling in, it should be announced at the villagers' meeting in the natural village, and then concentrated by administrative village, and representatives should be sent to the county government for review and stamping.
    3. For all properties related to land, such as the past practice of farmers to specify "linked to wood, soil, stone, and water" on the land deed, it must be clearly noted on the land certificate to prevent disputes.
    4. After the land certificate is stamped by the county government, a mass meeting of all male and female citizens of the whole village should be held to officially issue it to the head of the household. It should be announced that all men, women, old and young people have the right to own land, and their right to freely operate, buy, sell and lease under specific conditions is recognized. The government guarantees that it will not be violated by anyone. In the future, in the event of land transfer, sale, family division, or marriage, they are allowed to obtain or exchange land certificates from the government.
    5. Those who are confirmed by public discussion as ne'er-do-wells and are unlikely to be reformed for a while, their land certificates may be kept by the village government committee on their behalf, and issued to them after they have transferred to labor.
    6. Public land left for veterans or displaced refugees with the consent of the villagers during the land distribution last year, or滩地, alkali land, wasteland, or woodland that could not be distributed for a while due to special reasons, should also be filled out with land certificates, and the sovereignty belongs to the government. The land certificates should be handed over to the village government committee for safekeeping. Those who own land but have not returned due to special reasons (such as those fleeing famine, those fleeing, etc.) must also fill out the certificates, which will be kept by the village government committee on their behalf and handed over to them after they return.
    7. At the same time as issuing land certificates, it should also be announced that the original and distributed properties of the villagers are protected; landlords and rich peasants who still have a base should be encouraged to invest in agricultural, industrial, and commercial production, and their original and newly established industries and businesses should also be protected.
    8. Problems and experiences and lessons learned in the process of issuing land certificates must be reported at any time.

　　晋绥行署、农会通知各级
  　加紧填发土地证
  　早日确定地权发展农业生产
    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋绥解放区的绝大部分地区，封建土地制度业已消灭，土地改革业已完成，晋绥边区农会为及早确定地权，发展农业生产，特于八月廿日颁发布告，规定凡大多数群众对已分土地并无异议的村庄，即认为土地已经分好，全力恢复与发展生产，不再进行土地改革；责成各县县政府和农会，加紧填发土地证，早日确定地权，依法保护各阶层人民所有之土地财物。晋绥行署及晋绥边区农会并同时发出关于填发土地证通知。指出：这是土地改革后发展生产的头等重要事情，各级政府、代表会、农会应在村民中广泛而深入地宣传填发土地证之意义，认真负责领导，迅速填发。在填发土地证时须注意下列几点：
    一、各村政府委员会应亲自领导填发土地证的工作，并委托过去土地改革中选出的土地分配委员会负责进行。首先审查土地分配情况，允许农民对土地之分配情况提出不同意见，并加以解决。当地去年未分完之土地应一律分完。允许农民间为了耕作便利，自愿兑换土地。在对分配土地取得统一意见后向村民公布，并经过群众讨论，将原有及新分土地旧契约一律收回，当众烧毁，再发给新的土地证。
    二、土地证填发前，须首先按户填写草底，经过逐户校对清楚后，用墨笔楷字正式填写，不得使用草字、简字。填写后在自然村村民大会上宣布，再以行政村为单位集中，派代表呈请县政府审核盖印。
    三、凡与土地相关连之财产，如农民过去习惯在地契上写明“木土石水相连”，均须在土地证上批注清楚，以防纠纷。
    四、土地证由县政府盖印后，开全村男女公民群众大会，正式发给户主。宣布一切男女老少人口均有其土地所有权，承认其自由经营买卖及在特定条件下出租的权利，政府保障其不受任何人侵犯。以后遇有土地转移买卖、分家嫁娶等情形时，准予向政府分领或从新换取土地证。
    五、经公议确认为二流子，一时难望改好者，其土地证可由村政府委员会代替保存，待其转入劳动后再行发给。
    六、去年分地时经村民同意为外籍复员军人或移难民留下之公地，或因特别原因一时未能分配之滩地、碱地、荒地、或林木地，亦一律填发土地证，主权归政府，土地证交村政府委员会保存。土地所有者本人因特殊原因外出未归者（如逃荒户、逃亡户等）亦须填发，由村政府委员会代为保管，待其返回后交予本人。
    七、与发土地证同时，并宣布村民原有及已分得的财物，一律保护；地主富农之尚存有底财者，鼓励其投资农工商业生产，其原有及新营之工商业亦一律加以保护。
    八、关于在填发土地证中发生之问题及经验教训，须随时报告。
