Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's so-called "currency reform" announced on the 19th, stating: This is a massive inflation, a massive fraud, and a massive plunder. This is a gangster tactic by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to make a final struggle and prepare its own escape route, looting the wealth of the people of the whole country into the pockets of the four major families. The result will inevitably cause greater chaos in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and accelerate the final collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary rule.
　　The total amount of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Gold Yuan" is, according to those who announced it, 2 billion. Each "Gold Yuan" is equal to 3 million "Legal Tender." The amount of "Legal Tender" and "Northeast Circulation Certificates" in circulation is, according to Wang Yunwu, the Minister of Finance of the Chiang Kai-shek government, "only 200 million Gold Yuan is needed to recover them." That is to say, the "currency reform" nominally reduces the amount of currency in circulation, from 600 trillion "Legal Tender" to 2 billion "Gold Yuan," but in reality, it increases the amount of currency in circulation tenfold, from 200 million "Gold Yuan" to 2 billion "Gold Yuan," or from 600 trillion "Legal Tender" to 60 trillion "Legal Tender," which is to inflate the currency tenfold. In terms of the largest denomination of Chiang's currency, it is now 5 million "Legal Tender" per note, while Chiang Kai-shek's "Gold Yuan" is 100 yuan per note. One hundred yuan "Gold Yuan" is equal to 30 million "Legal Tender." That is to say, the "currency reform" nominally reduces the largest denomination of Chiang's currency from 5 million to 100, but in reality, it increases from 5 million to 300 million, an increase of sixtyfold. Increasing the currency tenfold and increasing the largest denomination sixtyfold, isn't this a massive currency inflation?
　　In order to realize this massive inflation, Chiang Kai-shek set up an unprecedented massive fraud, claiming that the "Gold Yuan" has "full backing," and even pretending to be serious, saying that "each yuan is legally defined to contain 0.22217 grams of pure gold," and establishing a "Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee," allocating "40 percent of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and 60 percent of the assets of state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet industries," as if there really is "full backing." In fact, foxes always have tails, and ogres always have fangs. The "Gold Yuan" cannot be cashed, nor can it be used to freely purchase foreign exchange. It is still a fictitious gold standard currency, just like the "Legal Tender." As A.E. Aczia, the owner of an American bank in Shanghai, said, this is just "exchanging one piece of paper for another." The real purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "full backing" is to use this as a pretext to defraud and attract gold, silver, and foreign currencies from the people and put them in his "Central Bank," which is to say, put them in the vaults of the four major families. On the other hand, he can also organize companies and issue stocks with the designated assets of state-owned enterprises, turning the industries that the four major families cannot move when they flee into liquid funds. This is truly killing two birds with one stone, truly an unprecedented massive fraud. To put it bluntly, Chiang Kai-shek could not even maintain the "Legal Tender" and "Northeast Circulation Certificates," which could be recovered with only one-tenth of the funds of the so-called "full backing," so how can he maintain the "Gold Yuan," which is ten times that amount? Isn't this a fraud?
　　It can be predicted that because most of the "Legal Tender" has become waste paper, the people will no longer trust Chiang's currency, even if it is called "Gold Yuan." Because no one wants to hand over gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign exchange to the four major families, Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhang Li-sheng and others will inevitably use fascist means to carry out inspection and plunder. The result will inevitably cause the wealthy to evade and hide their assets, and the market to become chaotic. Furthermore, because the Chiang Kai-shek government's issuance, taxation, and expenditures have increased more than tenfold, the income is not enough to cover the expenditures. Moreover, due to the repeated defeats of the Kuomintang reactionary army and the shrinking of the controlled areas, the economic bankruptcy will inevitably be aggravated, prices will inevitably rise, the black market will inevitably be revived, the "Gold Yuan" will inevitably depreciate, market speculation will inevitably become more uncontrollable, the lives of public employees and workers will inevitably be further deteriorated, and the army will also lose its fighting spirit. Therefore, the result of the "currency reform" will inevitably cause greater chaos in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas and accelerate the final collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Even if this "currency reform," due to Chiang Kai-shek's suppression and deception, combined with material assistance from American imperialism, may cause a temporary paralyzing effect, the entire decline of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, especially the inevitable failure of the anti-people war, no matter how much assistance American imperialism provides, cannot prevent this trend of greater chaos and final collapse. This has been repeatedly proven by the facts in the past few years.
　　Chiang Kai-shek arranged such a massive fraud to achieve disguised currency inflation, the purpose of which is to carry out unprecedented plunder. For several months before the "currency reform," the Chiang Kai-shek government deliberately accelerated the reduction of the "Legal Tender" price, issuing large amounts of banknotes three times in a row, so that the "Legal Tender" in the hands of the broad masses of the people had depreciated to less than one-tenth in three months. Once the "currency reform" came into effect, it first announced that all "Legal Tender" and "Northeast Circulation Certificates" must be exchanged before November 20th of this year. With the current transportation conditions and price fluctuations, wouldn't most of the "Legal Tender" held by the broad masses of people in vast rural areas and remote cities throughout the country become waste paper? The gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currencies held by the people are all limited to being exchanged at the Central Bank before September 30th, and foreign exchange assets are limited to being registered before December 31st, which is to plunder all the people's gold and silver treasures, including those of the bourgeoisie. Wang Yunwu said that the Chiang Kai-shek government's annual expenditure will reach 3.6 billion "Gold Yuan." Judging from the actual number of "Gold Yuan" issued, the people's burden has already increased tenfold. If they have to bear such a heavy annual expenditure again, it is unknown how many times the burden will increase in the future. However, the cost of living index for public employees and workers has been cancelled all at once. The main reason why Chiang Kai-shek implemented such an unprecedented plunder plan is to make the biggest struggle in the military, and to sweep the wealth of the people of the whole country into the vaults of the four major families, preparing to flee overseas in the event of final defeat, while throwing the Chinese people into the abyss of poverty. The Nanjing Heping Daily stated on the 21st that this currency plan was drafted by Kong Xiangxi in the United States. This makes it very clear that Chiang Kai-shek sent Soong Tzu-wen, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Zhang Li-sheng to plunder money in South China, Central China, and North China respectively, sent Kong Xiangxi to borrow money in the United States, and sent Chen Li-fu to contact reactionary leaders in the United States and Britain. All these preparations are clearly for the above-mentioned purpose.

  　评蒋匪“改革币制”
  　以变相大膨胀实行空前大掠夺
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】新华社记者评十九日蒋匪宣布的所谓“改革币制”称：这是一次大膨胀、大骗局和大掠夺。这是蒋介石匪帮为了最后挣扎并准备自己退路，把全国人民财富掳进四大家族腰包的流氓手段。其结果必定在国民党统治区引起更大混乱，促进蒋介石匪帮反动统治的最后崩溃。
    蒋匪的所谓“金圆券”，总额据宣布者为二十亿。每元“金圆券”等于“法币”三百万元。现在“法币”及“东北流通券”的发行量，据蒋匪政府财政部长王云五说：“仅需二亿元金圆券即可收回”，这就是说，“改革币制”形式上是缩小了发行量，由六百万亿“法币”改为廿亿“金圆券”，实际上却是增多了十倍发行量，由二亿“金圆券”增至二十亿“金圆券”，或由六百万亿“法币”增至六千万亿“法币”，就是把通货膨胀十倍。就蒋币最大票面额来说，现在是五百万元“法币”一张，蒋匪的“金圆券”是一百元一张。一百元“金圆券”等于“法币”三万万元。这就是说，“改革币制”形式上是把蒋币的最大票面额由五百万减至一百，实际上却是由五百万增至三万万，一下子提高了六十倍。把通货增加十倍，把最大票面额提高六十倍，这不是一次通货大膨胀是什么？
    蒋匪为了实现此次大膨胀，布置了一个空前大骗局，说什么“金圆券”有“十足准备”，并且还装腔作势，说什么“每元法定含纯金零点二二二一七公分”，成立什么“金圆券发行准备监理委员会”，拨交“百分之四十的黄金、白银与外汇，百分之六十的国营事业资产及敌伪产业”，似乎真有“十足准备”。其实，狐狸总有尾巴，夜叉总有獠牙，“金圆券”一来不能兑现，二来不能自由购买外汇，仍旧与“法币”一样，是虚金本位币，正如上海一个美商银行老板艾齐亚所说，这不过是“把一张纸换成另一张纸”。而蒋匪所谓“十足准备”的真正目的，却是打起这个幌子，一方面，好以此为圈套来骗取和吸引民间的金银外币，放到他的“央行”里去，也就是放进四大家族的金库里去；另一方面，又可以把指定的国营事业的资产，组织公司，发行股票，把四大家族将来逃走时搬不动的产业，一下子变成流动资金。这真是一箭双雕，真是空前未有的大骗局。戳穿了说，蒋匪既对只要用现在所谓“十足准备”的十分之一的基金就能收回的“法币”和“东北流通券”，都维持不了，那又何能维持十倍于此数的“金圆券”呢？这不是骗局是什么？
    可以预言：由于“法币”多数成为废纸，人民对于蒋币，即使叫“金圆券”也好，不会再有信任，由于人民谁也不愿把金、银、白洋、外汇交给四大家族，因而蒋介石、宋子文、蒋经国、张厉生等势必要用法西斯的手段施行检查与掠夺，其结果必然引起有资产者的逃避藏匿和市场的混乱。又由于蒋匪政府的发行、税收和开支都比从前增加了十倍以上，所入还不足支出之用；更由于国民党反动军队的处处失败，统治地区日益缩小，因之经济破产必将加剧，物价必将上涨，黑市必将复活，“金圆券”必将贬值，市场投机必将更加不可收拾，公教人员和工人的生活必将更加恶化，而军队也将更加丧失斗志。故“改革币制”的结果，必然引起蒋匪统治区的更大混乱，促进蒋匪统治的最后崩溃。即使这次“改革币制”，由于蒋匪的镇压和欺骗，双管齐下，加以美帝国主义的物资援助，或可引起一时的麻痹作用，但国民党反动统治的整个衰亡，尤其是反人民战争之不可避免地失败，不管美帝国主义有多大援助，都无法阻止这种更加混乱和最后崩溃的趋势，这是过去数年再三再四经过事实证明了的。
    蒋匪布置这样一个大骗局，来实现变相的通货大膨胀，其目的在于实行空前的大掠夺。“改革币制”前数月，蒋匪政府故意加速降低“法币”价格，连发三次大钞，使广大人民手中的法币在三个月内已经贬值至十倍以下。“改革币制”一来，首先宣布所有“法币”和“东北流通券”限于本年十一月二十日以前兑完。以现在这样的交通条件，这样的物价波动，三个月内全国广大乡村和偏僻城市的广大人民所持有的“法币”，岂不多数成为废纸？人民持有的黄金、白银、银币及外币，统限于九月三十日前向中央银行兑换，外汇资产限于十二月三十一日以前申请登记，这就是要把所有人民包括资产阶级在内的金银财宝都掳掠而去。王云五说，蒋匪政府岁出要达到三十六亿“金圆券”，单从“金圆券”发行的实际数目看，人民的负担已经增加十倍，若再负担这样重的岁出，今后的倍数更不知伊于胡底，而公教人员及工人的薪资的生活指数却一下子都取消了。蒋匪所以实行这样一个空前的掠夺计划，主要是为在军事上进行最大的挣扎，并把全国人民的财富席卷而入于四大家族金库，准备在最后失败时，好逃往海外，而把中国人民抛入穷困的深渊。南京和平日报二十一日称，此次货币计划，系孔祥熙在美国拟就。这就很明白，蒋匪派了宋子文、蒋经国、张厉生替他分别在华南、华中、华北掳钱，派了孔祥熙在美国借帐，派了陈立夫与美英反动头子接洽，这一切准备，显然是为着上述目的。
