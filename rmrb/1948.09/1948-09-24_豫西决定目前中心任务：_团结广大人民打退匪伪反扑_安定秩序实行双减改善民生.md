　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 21st. The joint conference of the CCP Western Henan District Committee and the military region's military rectification meeting have decided that the current central task of the district is: to unite the broad masses of the people in Western Henan and repel the counter-attack of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which is supported by force and combined with special agents, bandits, and local bullies within the liberated areas. The specific tasks are: 1. Strengthen the suppression of bandits and launch a powerful offensive with politics as the main and military as the auxiliary to eliminate the puppet bandits in the liberated areas, stabilize social order, and create the prerequisites for carrying out all other work. 2. Resolutely stop land reform, but firmly protect the vested interests of farmers; appropriate compensation should also be resolutely made for those who were wrongly struggled against and wrongly divided. 3. Initially determine the method and preparation steps for implementing rent and interest reduction in order to appropriately improve the people's living standards and provide the people with conditions for developing production. At the meeting, Zhang Xi, Secretary of the CCP Western Henan District Committee and Political Commissar of the Military Region, pointed out: The enemy's joint counter-attack is specifically manifested in armed sneak attacks, disrupting the rear, looting homes, creating rumors, and inciting people. The reason why the enemy can carry out this attempt to revive is due to certain shortcomings in our work. Many staff members, due to a series of victories of our army and the simplification of their understanding of the struggle against the enemy, have developed serious complacency and paralysis, which gave the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of and caused losses. He pointed out: Western Henan has already reached the scale of a revolutionary base area; due to the enemy's burning, killing, looting, and raping, resistance from the people has been universally aroused wherever they go; at the same time, there are sharp contradictions between the few chief culprits and the coerced followers within the bandit gangs; therefore, as long as everyone is ideologically prepared for the enemy's counter-attack, correctly grasps the policies, and organizes the forces well, we are fully confident that with the strength of the local military and civilians in Western Henan, we can eliminate the bandits and puppets in the controlled areas, repel the counter-attack, and vigorously carry out struggles in the border areas and advance outward. To this end, he called for strengthening policy study, uniting and cultivating cadres, especially cultivating a large number of local cadres, strengthening unified leadership, and overcoming the state of anarchy, disorganization, and indiscipline.

　　豫西决定目前中心任务：
    团结广大人民打退匪伪反扑
  　安定秩序实行双减改善民生
    【新华社中原二十一日电】豫西解放区中共地委联席会议与军区整军会议已决定该区目前中心任务为：团结豫西广大人民，打退国民党反动集团以武力为支柱，结合解放区内的特务、土匪、土劣的联合反攻。具体工作为：一、加强剿匪，展开以政治为主军事为辅的强大攻势，肃清解放区内的伪匪，以安定社会秩序，造成开展其他一切工作的前提条件。二、坚决停止土地改革，但坚决保障农民既得利益；对斗错和分错的也坚决地作适当补偿。三、初步确定实行减租减息办法及准备步骤，以求适当改善人民生活，使人民有发展生产的条件。会上，中共豫西区党委书记兼军区政委张玺指出：敌人的联合反攻具体表现武装偷袭，扰乱后方，打家劫舍，制造谣言，煽惑人心。敌人所以能实行这种企图死灰复燃的反攻，乃由于我工作中有着某些缺点。不少工作人员由于我军一连串的胜利和对敌斗争的认识单纯化，产生严重的轻敌麻痹情绪，致予敌有机可乘，造成损失。他指出：豫西已具有革命根据地规模；由于敌人的大烧，大杀，大抢，大奸淫，因此所到之处即普遍引起人民的反抗；同时，匪众内部少数首恶与胁从者之间存在尖锐矛盾；因此，只要大家在思想上对敌人的反攻有准备，正确掌握政策，力量组织好，就完全有把握以豫西当地军民的力量，肃清控制区的匪伪、打退反攻，并可有力地开展边沿区斗争，向外推进。为此，他号召加强政策学习，团结与培养干部，特别要培养大批地方干部，加强一元化领导，克服无政府、无组织、无纪律状态。
