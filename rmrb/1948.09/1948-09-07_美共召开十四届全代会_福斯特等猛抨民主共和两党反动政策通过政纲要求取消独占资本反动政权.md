Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: New York dispatches: The vanguard of the American working class, the Communist Party of the United States, held its 14th National Congress in New York from August 3rd to 6th. The congress heard reports from National Committee Chairman Foster, General Secretary Dennis, and Organization Secretary Winston, among others. In their reports, they fiercely criticized the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the Democratic and Republican parties, arguing that the policies of both parties, controlled by Wall Street, were leading to war, economic depression, and fascism. On August 6th, the congress adopted a program outlining the current tasks of the US Communist Party and elected a 13-member National Committee headed by Foster and Dennis. Foster and Dennis were re-elected as Chairman and General Secretary of the National Committee, respectively. The congress closed on the evening of the 6th.

The congress, in its adopted program, emphasized that no external force threatens the United States, and that the current US military buildup is an attempt by monopoly capital to establish world domination. The program also stated that the Soviet Union is the most solid pillar of peace; therefore, the Communist Party calls for a return to Roosevelt's peace policy and the implementation of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. The program calls for an end to the "Cold War," the repeal of the conscription law, the reduction of massive armaments, the consolidation of the United Nations organization as an instrument of world peace, the completion of peaceful settlements for a unified and democratic Germany and Japan based on the Yalta Agreement, the withdrawal of US troops from China, South Korea, and Greece, and the abandonment of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Regarding domestic policy, the program calls for the abolition of the rule of monopoly capital, the root cause of reactionary fascism and war, the consolidation of democratic principles, and the struggle to improve people's living standards. The program specifically demands an end to the lynching of Black people, the abolition of poll taxes, and all forms of discrimination against Black people. The program declares that the Communist Party of the United States actively supports the recently formed Progressive Party in Philadelphia and will, along with millions of other Americans, support the Progressive Party's candidates. This party is a grand alliance of workers, farmers, Black people, youth, liberal professionals, and small business owners, and is an anti-monopoly capital, anti-fascist, and anti-war party. However, the program also points out that the Communist Party and Wallace's Progressive Party have different opinions on fundamental and tactical issues. The Communist Party firmly believes that only a socialist society can bring lasting peace.

　　美共召开十四届全代会
  　福斯特等猛抨民主共和两党反动政策通过政纲要求取消独占资本反动政权
    【新华社陕北四日电】纽约迟到消息：八月三日至六日，美国工人阶级的先锋队——美国共产党于纽约召开党的第十四届全国代表大会。大会听取了全国委员会主席福斯特、总书记但尼斯及组织书记温斯顿等的报告。他们在报告中猛烈抨击民主党与共和党的反动的对内对外政策，认为两党的政策是导向战争、经济萧条及法西斯主义的政策，都是由华尔街控制的。大会于八月六日通过了规定美共当前任务的政纲，并选出以福斯特、但尼斯为首的由十三人组成的全国委员会。福斯特与但尼斯分别连任全国委员会的主席与总书记。大会于六日晚闭幕。
    大会在其通过的政纲中着重指出：没有任何外来力量威胁着美国，美国现在的备战乃是独占资本建立世界统治的企图。政纲中又指出，苏联是和平最坚固的柱石，因此，共产党号召回到罗斯福的和平政策，实行对苏友好合作。政纲要求停止“冷战”，废止征兵法，缩减庞大军备，巩固世界和平工具——联合国组织，根据雅尔塔协定为统一与民主的德国及日本完成和平解决办法，撤退中国、南朝鲜及希腊的美军，废弃马歇尔计划与杜鲁门主义。在对内政策方面，政纲中要求取消反动法西斯主义战争根源的独占资本的政权，巩固民主原则并为改进人民生活水准而斗争。政纲特别要求取消对黑人的非刑拷打，取消人头税以及一切歧视黑人的行为。政纲中声明，美国共产党积极支持不久前在费城成立的进步党，并将和千百万其他美国人一起，拥护进步党的候选人。该党是工人、农民、黑人、青年、自由职业者小企业主的大联合，又是反对独占资本的、反法西斯的，反战争的政党。但政纲同时指出：共产党和华莱士的进步党在基本的及策略的问题上，意见并不相同。共产党坚决相信，只有社会主义的社会才能有永久的和平。
