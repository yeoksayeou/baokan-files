Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: TASS reports: The Allied Council for Japan held a special meeting on August 28th. Soviet representative Major General Kislenko delivered a speech stating that on July 22nd, MacArthur sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, requesting the immediate revision of the "Civil Service Law" passed by the Japanese Parliament on October 16, 1947, and demanding the enactment of laws prohibiting government employees from striking and collectively bargaining with the government. On July 31st of this year, the Japanese government, following MacArthur's letter, promulgated a special decree prohibiting government employees and public institution employees from engaging in collective bargaining and strikes, and all previously concluded collective contracts were also canceled by the same decree. The aforementioned decree took effect immediately after its promulgation, and the Japanese government launched a widespread suppression movement against government employees based on this. Not only that, but the American occupation authorities also directly participated in the suppression of Japanese workers; the Toho Film Company incident on August 19th of this year is one example. All of the above proves that the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government have violated the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's political decisions regarding the basic policy towards Japan after surrender and the principles of Japanese trade union organization. In view of this, Kislenko suggested that MacArthur should abolish his directive to the Japanese government and cancel the decree promulgated by the Japanese government, thereby ending the suppression of government agency employees.

　　盟国对日委员会特别会议上
    苏方代表发表演说要求终止镇压职工
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：盟国对日委员会于八月廿八日举行特别会议，苏联代表基斯连科少将发表演说称，七月廿二日，麦克阿瑟曾致函日政府首相芦田均，要求立即修改日本议会一九四七年十月十六日所通过的“公务员法”，并要求制定禁止政府职工罢工及与政府集体议价的法律。今年七月卅一日，日本政府依从麦克阿瑟的信函颁布了一项特别法令，禁止政府职工及公共机关职工进行集体议价与罢工，从前所订的一切集体合同也被同一法令取消。上述法令颁布后立即生效，日本政府并据此对政府职工发动了广泛的镇压运动。不仅如此，美国占领当局亦直接参加了对日本职工的镇压，今年八月十九日东宝影片公司的事件即其一例。上述一切，证明美国占领当局及日本政府违犯了波茨顿宣言及远东委员会关于对投降后日本之基本政策及日本工会组织原则之政治决定。有鉴于此，基斯连科建议麦克阿瑟应废除他对日本政府的指令，并取消日本政府颁布的法令，从而终止对政府机关职工的镇压。
