[North Yue News] In Jia Village, Meng County, the labor substitute farming work has been rectified through democratic discussions among the masses. The village has a total of 301 households, with military, worker, and martyr dependents accounting for 56 households. Military, worker, and martyr dependents cultivated 555 mu of land themselves, while the remaining 234 mu were farmed by the masses as substitutes. Among them, 8 households relied entirely on substitute farming due to a lack of labor, 31 households relied on substitute farming for a portion of their land, and a portion was not farmed as a substitute.

In the past, the substitute farming work in the village was not done well. Both the masses and the military, worker, and martyr dependents had many opinions about the substitute farming work. For example, everyone was dissatisfied when only new military dependents received substitute farming, while old military dependents did not.

In early April, the work team held separate discussion meetings with the masses in the village to mobilize them to discuss the substitute farming work. At that time, there were two different opinions. Most people said: "The children of military dependents go to the front line to protect the masses. Without them, the masses in the rear would not be able to live peacefully, so we must do a good job in substitute farming." A few people said: "Young and middle-aged people joining the army is their duty. Preferential treatment is acceptable, but when working, they (military dependents) must take care of the food and drink for the people and livestock." The work team enlightened everyone to continue studying which principle was correct. After another argument, the former opinion gained the sympathy of the masses. Many people believed: "We cannot let the land of military dependents be wasted. People are shedding blood desperately on the front line, and it is the responsibility of the masses to farm their land as substitutes in the rear." After such discussions, the masses voluntarily signed up to participate in substitute farming and found their own targets, then determined the acreage or labor for substitute farming. Because the substitute farmers were all looking for military dependents they got along with, the relationship was relatively close, and there were fewer disputes. Jiang Sishang contracted to farm Sun Zhong's three mu of land, which was much better than when others farmed it as substitutes. The two sides seemed very harmonious; Jiang Sisheng and ten others contracted to farm Jiang Shoudu's fourteen mu of land, and when sowing, they first consulted with Shoudu's family about what crops to plant, and the work they did made Shoudu's family very satisfied.

In order to solve the difficulties of military dependents in a timely manner, four military dependents groups were formed, and the village elected a military dependents representative to regularly reflect the opinions of military dependents and check the substitute farming situation according to the season. Village cadres such as Jiang Sixiao, the village party branch secretary, and Liu Siyou, the farmers' association chairman, personally supervised and inspected the substitute farming work. They regarded the substitute farming work as very important and studied the substitute farming issue at every meeting.

After this rectification, the military dependents felt very satisfied. They reflected: "This year's planting was early and the weeding was good, which is much better than before."

(Jia Village's method of solving the substitute farming problem through democratic discussion and clarifying the masses' thinking is good. However, the point of "voluntarily signing up to participate in substitute farming" may have loopholes, because substitute farming is the duty of every citizen. While it is acceptable to find one's own target on this basis, one cannot abandon one's duty under the pretext of volunteering. --Editor)

### 贾村注意照顾军属　民主整顿代耕

　　贾村注意照顾军属
  　民主整顿代耕
    【北岳讯】孟县贾村劳力代耕工作，经群众民主讨论进行整理。该村共有三百零一户，军、工、烈属占五十六户。军、工、烈属自己养种着五百五十五亩地，其余二百三十四亩由群众代耕。其中没有劳动力全部依靠代耕者有八户，代耕一部分的有三十一户，另有一部未代耕。
    过去该村代耕工作做的不好，不论群众或军、工、烈属，对代耕工作均有不少意见，例如光给新军属代耕，不给老军属代耕，大家就不满意。
    四月初，工作组在该村分头召开群众座谈会，发动群众讨论代耕工作。当时有两种不同的意见，大部分人说：“军属子弟到前线去，是为了保护群众，没有他们，群众在后方就不能过平安日子，所以一定要做好代耕工作。”少数人说：青壮年当兵是他应尽的责任，优待可以，但做活时他们（军属）要管人和牲口的吃喝”。工作组启发大家，继续研究到底哪个道理对。经过再次的咯吵，前面的意见获得群众的同情，好多人认为：“可不能荒了军属的土地，人家前线拼命流血，在后方给他代耕是群众的责任。”经过这样讨论后，群众都自动报名参加代耕，并自找对象，再确定代耕地亩或代耕的劳力。因为代耕者都是找和自己对劲的军属，关系比较密切，纠纷也就少了。姜思尚包种了孙忠的三亩地，比别人代耕时种的强多了。双方显得很和谐；姜思圣十个人包种着姜守渡十四亩地，在播种时先找守渡家商量种什么庄稼，做的活使守渡家非常满意。
    为了及时的解决军属的困难，又组成了四个军属小组，全村又推出一个军属代表，经常反映军属意见，按季节检查代耕情形。该村支部书记姜思孝、农会主席刘四犹等村干部都亲自督促检查代耕工作，他们把代耕工作看的非常重要，每次接头会议上，都研究代耕问题。
    经过这次整顿后，军属都感到很满意，他们反映：“今年种的早锄的好，比先前强多了。”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （贾村经过民主讨论，打通群众思想，解决代耕问题，这个办法是好的。但“自动报名参加代耕”一点则可能发生漏洞。因为代耕是每个公民应有的义务，可在这个基础上自找对象，却不能借口自动而放弃义务。——编者）
