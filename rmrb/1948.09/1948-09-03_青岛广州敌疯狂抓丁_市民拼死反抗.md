Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: News from Kuomintang-controlled newspapers: Enemy troops are frantically enlisting soldiers in cities such as Qingdao and Guangzhou, arousing active or passive resistance from citizens. Since mid-June, Qingdao has been shrouded in the terror of conscription. Whenever citizens leave their homes, they join together in groups to prevent being captured alone. Some even carry stones to resist. Whenever enemy military vehicles stop or enemy troops move in groups, citizens flee far away. Those who are captured shout and scream, resisting to the death, and run away whenever they have the opportunity. A carpenter at the Qianhai Pier jumped into the sea to escape after being captured. On June 10th, a fish vendor who was captured at Haibo Bridge drew a knife, stabbed the conscriptor, and escaped. On the same day, conscriptors grabbed a military officer. After the officer's explanation of his identity proved ineffective, he ordered his subordinates to open fire, and the two sides fought for a long time. On June 12th, when the enemy was conscripting soldiers in the city, many shops closed their doors, resembling a strike, to confront them. In June and July, enemy troops in Guangzhou used both hard conscription and deceptive abduction methods in the prosperous streets of Changdi, Haizhu Bridge, and Henan. The former involved armed soldiers suddenly and forcibly beating citizens, falsely accusing them of being "deserters" or "thieves," and forcibly dragging them away. Those who were captured wailed and screamed, a tragic sight. The latter used various means to lure the victims into the military camp, then strip them of their clothes, shave their heads, and force them to "enlist." After the conscripts were caught and deceived, they were secretly transported to Taiwan and other places, making it impossible for their families to rescue them. On July 7th, Zhong Bingnan and Xie Jianyu, students of the Cultural Middle School, were lured onto a boat on the South Bank and secretly transported to the Foshan town near Guangzhou to enter the camp.

Another report: In June, when Hubei's Hefeng County received new recruits, it implemented tortures such as hanging, nose piercing, and abdominal stabbing. Six new recruits were covered in injuries on the spot, and two disappeared. One of them was found in Wangjiaping Lake in the county, his head had been cut off, his arms had been sawn off, the muscles of his right leg had been completely peeled off, and his body was covered with carrying-pole bruises. After this atrocity was discovered, it shocked the entire county, and more than seventy new recruits collectively broke through the enemy's heavy cordon and fled on the morning of June 15th.

　　青岛广州敌疯狂抓丁
  　市民拼死反抗
    【新华社陕北卅日电】综合国民党区报刊消息：敌军在青岛、广州等城市疯狂抓丁，激起市民积极或积极的反抗。六月中旬以来，青岛经常笼罩在抓丁恐怖中，市民每逢出门，即连结多人，以防势单被抓；有的更怀揣石头，以备反抗。每当敌用军汽车停下或敌军集体出动时，市民即远远逃避。被抓者大喊大叫，拼死反抗，得机会即逃跑。前海栈桥有一木匠被抓，即跳入海内逃生。六月十日海泊桥被抓的一位鱼贩，曾抽出刀子将抓丁者刺伤后逃走。同日抓丁者将一军官抓住，该军官在说明自己身份无效后，即指挥所属开枪，双方格斗多时。六月十二日敌在市内抓丁时，许多商店均关门，形同罢市，以为对抗。六、七月份，广州敌军在长堤、海珠桥及河南一带繁盛街道，使用硬抓与诱掳两种方式进行抓丁。前者是由武装士兵将市民突予强行殴打，并诬指为“逃兵”或“小偷”，强拉硬拖而去。被抓者号哭惨叫，凄惨异常。后者则用种种手段，使被诱者进入部队营地，然后进行剥衣剃头，强迫“入伍”。壮丁抓骗到手后，即偷运至台湾等地，使家属无从营救。七月七日文化中学学生钟炳南及谢建瑜，在南堤被诱上艇，偷运至广州附近的佛山镇入营。
    另息：六月间鄂西鹤峰县在接收新兵时，曾施行吊顶、穿鼻及刺腹毒等刑，当场有新兵六名遍体鳞伤，两名失踪，旋于该县王家坪湖泊中发现其中一名，头已被割去，两膀被锯断，右腿筋肉全遭剥落，满身扁担伤痕。此暴行被发现后，惊震全县，新兵七十余人于六月十五日上午集体冲破敌重重警戒线逃去。
