　　The timely capturing and reporting by the Fourth Branch of the North Yue District of the distribution of land certificates in Xin'an and Xizhuang villages, PingShan County, and the reflection of the issues that should be paid attention to during the distribution of land certificates, are very good. Many areas have now begun to revise the class status and distribute land certificates. We hope that comrades participating in this work will write and send articles about the problems found in the work and the reactions of the masses as soon as possible.

    北岳四支社及时抓紧报导平山新安、西庄两村颁发土地证情形，并反映了颁发土地证应注意的问题等，这是很好的。现不少地区都已开始改订成份，颁发土地证等工作，希参加这一工作的同志能将工作中发现的问题及群众的反映等随时写稿寄来，越快越好。
