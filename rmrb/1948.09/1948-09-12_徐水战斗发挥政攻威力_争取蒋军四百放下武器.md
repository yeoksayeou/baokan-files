[Pingbao Frontline News] In the battle to capture XuShui by the People's Liberation Army on July 20th on the Pingbao Frontline, the power of the political offensive was brought into play. Nearly 400 enemy soldiers were persuaded to lay down their arms in the city and at the train station through loudspeaker appeals. On the first day of the PLA's attack on the city, signal flares were fired into the city, and many leaflets and safety passes were distributed. The content of the leaflets, in addition to publicizing our army's victorious situation, also informed the enemy that their division commander, Chen Zhiping, had been captured in Dingxing. This pre-battle political offensive powerfully shook the enemy's determination and confidence to resist. After seeing the leaflet, the enemy regiment commander lowered his head and said nothing, and the general soldiers discussed it a lot. Some enemy regimental headquarters captains secretly changed into plain clothes after seeing the leaflets. The power of the People's Liberation Army's political offensive is based on political and military advantages. In battlefield appeals, the enemy was given a detailed explanation of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior and the aggression of American imperialism. The enemy was skeptical about the People's Liberation Army's liberation of cities such as Dingxing and the capture of their division commander, Chen Zhiping. When the PLA launched its offensive and the artillery fire landed on their positions accurately and densely, they believed it and their confidence in resisting disappeared. During the battle, the PLA also closely combined military actions with appeals. Many enemies who were resisting in bunkers or hiding in dugouts surrendered their guns after being pressured by the PLA's firepower and after hearing the appeals.

　　徐水战斗发挥政攻威力
  　争取蒋军四百放下武器
    【平保前线讯】七月二十日平保前线人民解放军攻克徐水战斗中，发挥了政治攻势的威力，在城内与车站，用喊话争取了近四百敌人放下武器。解放军攻城的头一天，曾向城内打进信号弹去，发出许多的传单与安全证。传单内容，除宣传我军胜利形势外，并告诉敌人的师长陈志平已在定兴被俘了，这种战前的政治攻势，有力的动摇了敌人的抵抗决心与信心。敌团长见传单后低头不语，一般士兵议论纷纷。一个敌团部上尉军官们见到传单后都回去偷偷换了便衣。解放军政治攻势的威力，是以政治上的优势与军事上的优势作基础的，在战场喊话中对敌人详尽的说明了蒋介石的卖国行为，与美帝国主义的侵略行为。敌人对解放军解放定兴等城，活捉其师长陈志平，有些人半信半疑。当解放军开始攻势，炮火落到他们阵地又多又准的时候，他们就相信了，抵抗的信心也消失了。在对战过程中，解放军同样把军事上的动作和喊话紧密的结合起来，许多正在地堡中抵抗和钻在地洞里藏躲的敌人，都是在解放军火力的压力下，经过喊话缴了枪。
