[Jizhong Dispatch] In Yangjia Fangbei, Shulu Eighth District, which has a total of 159 households, eight middle-peasant households had their doors sealed during last year's land reform, and some scattered furniture, bedding, chests, and cabinets were confiscated or requisitioned. Later, when the standards for class division became clearer, only the wrongly designated class status was corrected, and the confiscated items were not compensated. This caused some middle peasants to have ideological concerns and dampened their enthusiasm for production. Recently, when arranging to conclude land reform, a mass meeting was held. Yang Qinghe, the branch secretary, explained to everyone the spirit of correcting wrongly designated class status, compensating middle peasants, and developing production. This was followed by discussions. Some said, "It's unreasonable for us to divide up what people earned with their own blood and sweat." After the meeting, the unanimous opinion was: things taken from middle peasants should be returned if they should be, and compensated if necessary. Then, a careful review and examination was carried out, and all the wrongly designated were corrected. In order to convince landlords and former rich peasants, they were gathered together, and the standards for class division were explained. After the review and assessment of class status, representatives and group leaders convened a unity meeting with the households whose class status had been wrongly designated. At the meeting, the branch secretary first apologized to the middle peasants whose class status had been wrongly designated, and also advised everyone to work hard in the future and not to dwell on this matter. On the spot, middle peasant Yang Lao Ying said, "This is nothing. If mistakes are made, they are corrected. Large items like livestock and waterwheels were not touched, and now small items are being returned. This is too good." Then their clothes, bedding, and some small items were returned to their owners (because they had not yet been distributed). Only some chests and cabinets had already been distributed in January of this year. The general opinion was that everyone's life was not a problem, so no more returns or compensations were made. The middle peasants were very happy with this. Then, the fruits of the struggle were cleaned up and distributed. Among the distribution, 33 middle-peasant households received movable property, and some things were also given to landlords and former rich peasants. They were given enough houses to live in, and they were educated to work hard and produce in the future. Since the movable property was distributed, the masses have been thinking about living a good life. Middle peasant Yang Lao Zheng, after finishing his work in the fields, is also thinking about doing petty trading. His father, Yang Lao Hong, has also become diligent and thrifty, getting up in the middle of the night to collect manure, filling a basket by dawn. He also carries a manure basket when he goes to work in the fields. Middle peasant Li Lao Geng said, "Before, I just felt that working was meaningless, only thinking about eating and drinking! The poorer the better. Now I've figured it out. In the future, whoever works is honorable, and whoever doesn't live a good life and becomes poor will be ashamed. In the future, I have to be thrifty and work hard."

　　补偿错斗户结束土改
  　杨家方碑生产起了劲
    【冀中电】束鹿八区杨家方碑，共一百五十九户，去年土改时，有八户中农被封了门，把一些零星家具、被褥和箱柜等没收和征收了。以后划阶级的标准明确了，光把订错成份改了过来，没收的东西都没有补偿。这样就使得一些中农思想顾虑不能解除，生产的劲头不高。最近布置结束土改，开了群众大会，支部书记杨清合，把改正错订成份、补偿中农、发展生产等精神和大伙讲了讲，接着就展开讨论，有的说：“人家一点血一点汗做来的东西，咱们分了不合理。”会后一致的意见是：弄中农的东西，该退的就退，该补的补。接着又仔细的评议审查，把错订了的都改正过来。为了让地主旧富农们口服心服，就把他们叫到一块，讲了讲划阶级的标准。审查和评订成份作过了，代表、组长就召集错订成份户，开了一个团结会，会上，支书先向错订成份的中农道了歉，还劝大伙往后好好劳动，不要把这事搁在心里。当场中农杨老应就说：“这不算什么，错了改过来，牲口、水车大的东西都没动，零星东西又要往回退，这就太好了。”接着就把他们的衣服、被褥和一些零星东西等，都退还了本主（因还未分配），只有一部分箱柜等，今年一月里已经分配了，大家的意见，各家的生活都不成问题，就不再退补了。这样做，中农们都挺喜欢。接着就清理分配果实，分配中有三十三户中农分到了浮财，还给地主和旧富农一些东西，分给了他们够住的房子，教育他们往后好好劳动生产。自从分了浮财以后，群众都想着把日子过好。中农杨老争，做清了地里活，还想着做小买卖。他父亲杨老红，也勤俭起来，半夜里就起来拾粪，天明就拾满一筐。到地做活也背着粪筐。中农李老庚说：“以前我光觉得做活没意思，光说吃吧喝吧！越穷了越好。这时候可想开了，往后谁劳动谁光荣，谁不好好过日子，过穷了也丢人，往后可得省俭点，好好的干活。”
