　　Central Plains Unit, 3rd Company Soldiers' Committee
　　Correctly Promote Democracy and Improve Leadership
　　Rift Between Company Commander and Political Instructor Eliminated
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd] The Soldiers' Committee of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army, correctly promoted democracy under centralized leadership, provided suggestions to the leading organs, and strengthened the unity between the company's political instructor and company commander. The company commander and political instructor had mutual rifts and uncoordinated work, which made the soldiers very anxious and concerned. Wang Yucai, chairman of the Soldiers' Committee, and Chen Yutian, member of the company's Party branch committee, under the inspiration of the battalion instructor, convened a joint meeting of the Soldiers' Committee and the branch committee to specifically discuss this issue. They objectively analyzed the main strengths and weaknesses of the political instructor and company commander, and the entire Soldiers' Committee members and branch committee members signed a report to the regiment's Party committee, requesting them to send someone to help improve the leadership. In their report, they cited the political instructor's merits of turning over the spoils of war to the public, caring for the masses, and caring for food, as well as shortcomings such as poor political cultivation, disunity with superiors and subordinates, and lack of composure in combat. For the company commander, they cited advantages such as good political cultivation, going deep into the lower levels, and composure in combat, as well as shortcomings such as being fond of sarcastic remarks and complaining. At the same time, it was pointed out that both of them were wrong in their disunity. After receiving the report, the regiment committee immediately sent people to the company to understand the situation and solicited the opinions of the instructor and company commander on the contents of the report one by one. The instructor and company commander both agreed with the strengths and weaknesses listed. A full company-wide enlarged meeting of squad leaders, deputy squad leaders, soldiers' committee members, and branch committee members was then convened, where the political instructor and company commander both made self-criticisms based on the facts, resolving the issue of their disunity. They both expressed gratitude for the help of the Soldiers' Committee.

　　中原某部第三连战士委员会
  　正确发扬民主改进领导
    连长与政治指导员隔阂消除
    【新华社中原二十二日电】中原解放军某团第三连的战士委员会，正确发扬集中领导下的民主，向领导机关提供意见，加强了该连政治指导员和连长的团结。该连连长和政治指导员互有隔阂，工作上不协调，战士们都非常着急和关心。战士委员会主席王玉才和该连党的支部委员陈玉田等，在营教导员的启示下，就召开了战士委员会及支部委员会联席会议，专门讨论了这个问题。他们客观地分析了政治指导员和连长的主要优缺点，由全体战士委员会委员和支委签名报告团的党委会，要求派人来帮助改进领导。他们在报告中，举出了政治指导员的缴获归公、关心群众、关心伙食等优点和政治修养差、对上下级不团结、战斗中不大沉着等缺点。对连长则举出了政治修养好、深入下层、战斗中沉着等优点和好说怪话、发牢骚等缺点。同时提出两人在不团结上都有不对的地方。团委于接到报告后立即派人到该连了解情况，将报告内容一一征求指导员与连长的意见。指导员与连长都同意了所列举的那些优缺点。于是召开了全连正副班长、战士委员和支委的扩大会议，政治指导员和连长都根据事实，作了自我检讨，解除了两人不团结的问题。他们对战士委员会的帮助均表谢。
