　　Enforced Orders Followed by Neglect
  　Production Losses in the Eighth District of Anguo
    [Jizhong Electric] Cadres in the Eighth District of Anguo seriously neglected production leadership, causing the district's production to fall into a state of drift. In half a year, the district committee held only two production meetings, and the second meeting was not even conveyed to the villages. District cadres regarded production work as "incidental" and "supplementary," rarely going to the countryside to lead production work. Around February of the lunar calendar, Wang Shu, the district head, and two others held a meeting of party members and cadres in Xu Xin Village. Under the influence of a one-sided view of poverty at the time, they promoted and mobilized the masses for production, saying: "Organizing into mutual aid teams requires mutual assistance for a year; no one is allowed to quit halfway. Party members and cadres must be filial sons to poor peasants, and branch secretaries must play an exemplary role; those with labor power should help those without." At the time, Branch Secretary Wang Yongqing said, "I will help Ren Luoguo, a poor peasant." The village head said, "I will do farm work for Ren Zhuyun, a military family member." Others also volunteered to "help poor peasants." However, District Head Wang forced everyone to organize on the spot, saying, "No one can leave until they are organized." Under these circumstances, the masses reluctantly formed groups. District Head Wang also said, "Party members and cadres must launch a manure-cart campaign, with each person delivering a cart of manure to poor peasants." At the time, all party members and cadres echoed the call. After District Head Wang left, the so-called "mutual aid teams" and "manure-cart campaign" fell through. The branch secretary said, "I can't even finish my own family's work, how can I help poor peasants?" District cadre Jia Feixiang also sat in Nanwangmai Village urging "organization," but did not check up on it afterward. It was not until the sub-district work team inspected that they discovered not a single mutual aid team existed; some had been organized for only half a day before collapsing. This is the bad result of enforced orders. After issuing enforced orders, they no longer cared, thus forming a drift in production work. For example, some district cadres believed that the masses knew how to produce, while they themselves lacked production knowledge, so leading production was meddling. Wang Hanchen, the district committee secretary, believed that other tasks were very urgent, such as the twelve types of forms and tax collection in July, so there was no time to lead production.
    Because district cadres relaxed production leadership, many village branches also paid little attention to leading production. Many village organizations were unsound (only recently rectified), coupled with disunity between new and old cadres and low morale, which prevented the party's policies from being well implemented. The county committee's production meeting for village cadres in June was not discussed in Nanwangmai and six other villages. Therefore, the masses knew little about the party's production policies and the seven measures of the Jizhong Administrative Office for rewarding the development of production. After the North Xu Xin Village branch returned from the county meeting, they only told the branch and villagers' meeting, "Do not waste an inch of land, everyone organize to implement work-point clearing..." At the same time, they found someone who liked to eat, drink, and be lazy to lead production. As a result, the village was only lively for a while during the "blitz" of wasteland reclamation, and then it collapsed. Other village branches rarely led production. Village cadres generally held the erroneous idea that "other work must be done, but it doesn't matter if production isn't led." Due to the relaxation of production leadership by district and village cadres, production in the district was in a state of serious drift. The organization of production mutual aid was not carried out well at all. Because agricultural loan work was not checked in a timely manner, many loan recipients had the idea of borrowing without repaying. Most of the water conservancy loans were not used for production. Three villages, including Zheng Village, borrowed funds for twenty-one waterwheels, but actually only bought six, and the rest of the funds were used for other things. Because the party's policy of developing production was not widely and deeply publicized, the masses still had many ideological concerns. Some poor peasants were not active enough in production, and middle peasants still had many concerns about getting rich.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's note: The abandonment of production leadership in the Eighth District of Anguo, and some seriously enforced ordering methods that violated the principles of organizing production, not only alienated the masses but also caused great losses to the development of the great production movement. The district's self-criticism is also extremely superficial, and the problem has not been thoroughly solved ideologically. The Anguo County Committee and County Government, regarding the serious phenomenon of abandoning production leadership in the Eighth District, I wonder if they have conducted inspections? Why has this erroneous phenomenon continued for so long without being corrected? The Anguo County Committee should promptly conduct on-the-spot inspections, strengthen leadership, rectify policies, and educate village cadres and party members to reform their work style and unite the masses for production.

### 先强迫命令后放任自流　安国八区生产受损失

　　先强迫命令后放任自流
  　安国八区生产受损失
    【冀中电】安国八区干部，严重忽视生产领导，使该区生产陷于自流。半年来，区委只召开过两次生产会议，第二次还没传达到村。区干部把生产工作当作“附带”和“配备”工作，很少为领导生产工作下过乡。阴历二月间，该区区长王署等三人在徐辛庄召开党员、干部会议，在当时片面的贫困观点支配之下，宣传动员群众生产时说：“组织起来要互助一年，不许半路没了事，党员、干部要给贫雇农当孝子，支部书记要起模范作用，有人的要和没人的互助。”当场支书王永清说：“我和贫农任罗锅互助。”村长说：“我给军属任助云做地里活。”别人也自认“给贫农互助。”但王区长当场强制大家组织起来，并说：“谁组织不起来不能走。”在此种情况下，群众便勉强的结合了组。王区长又说：“党员、干部要开展一车粪运动，每人给贫雇农送一车粪。”当时全体党员、干部也都随声响应了。王区长走后，所谓“互助组”、“一车粪运动”也就流产了。支书说：“家里活还做不过来，怎么为贫雇农哩？”区干部贾飞祥也在南王买村坐催着“组织起来”，但以后也没检查过。直到分区工作组检查时，才发现一个互助组也没有，有的只组织了半天就垮了台。这是强迫命令造成的恶果。他们强迫命令之后，便再也不管了，因而又形成生产工作的自流，如有的区干部认为群众会生产，咱们缺乏生产知识，领导生产是多管。区委书记王汉臣认为别的工作一来都是很紧的，如七月里十二种表格、征收等等任务一大堆，那有时间领导生产呢？
    因为区干部放松了生产领导，所以好多村支部在领导生产上也不注意。不少的村组织不健全（最近才整顿），加之新老干部不团结，工作情绪不高，致使党的政策不能很好贯彻下去。县委六月间召开的各村干部生产会议，南王买等七村根本没开会研讨。因此党的生产政策和冀中行署奖励发展生产的七项办法，群众很少知道。北徐辛庄支部从县开会回去后，只在支部、村民大会说了说“不要荒废一寸土地，大伙组织起来实行记工清工………”，同时找了一个好吃喝懒做活的来领导生产。结果，该村除了“突击”荒地时热闹了一阵，以后就垮台了。别的村支部则很少领导生产。各村干部普遍存在着“别的工作不作不行，生产不领导不要紧”的错误思想。由于区、村干部放松生产领导，使该区生产形成严重的自流。对生产互助根本未很好进行组织。农贷工作因未及时检查，好多贷款户存在着借了不还的思想；水利贷款大部没用到生产中去。郑庄等三村，贷了二十一辆水车的款，实际上只买了六辆，其余的款就干了旁的。由于没广泛深入宣传我党发展生产的政策，所以群众还存在着不少的思想顾虑，部分贫农生产也不够积极，中农对发家致富仍有好多顾虑。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：安国八区放弃生产领导，和某些违犯组织生产原则的严重强迫命令方式，这不仅脱离了群众，而且对开展大生产运动造成了很大损失。该区检讨亦极浅薄，未从思想上彻底解决问题。安国县委、县府对八区此种放弃生产领导的严重现象，不知是否做过检查？为何使这种错误现象继续很久，而未得纠正？安国县委应迅速进行实地检查，加强领导，端正政策，并教育村干、党员改造作风，团结群众进行生产。
