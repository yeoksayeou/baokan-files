    Flee and Surrender to Us in Droves

    [Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 18th] Enemy troops along the Beining, Pinggu, and Pingsui lines are fleeing to the People's Liberation Army with their weapons in increasing numbers. The Rehe-Eastern Military Sub-district received 1,631 surrendered Kuomintang soldiers from the Jinzhou-Linyu section of the Beining Line in July, a slight increase of one-third compared to June. The 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion, 262nd Regiment, 88th Division stationed on this line had 18 men desert in one night. A squad of soldiers from the 498th Regiment of the 8th Army formerly stationed in Jinxi, after killing their squad leader, defected to the liberated areas with all their weapons. Enemy troops on the Pinggu line are also surrendering in squads. In Shunyi County alone, more than 290 enemy soldiers were received in June and July. This does not include those who were sent home immediately after being received by the county. According to surrendered enemy soldiers, over 110 men deserted from a certain battalion of the 4th Division of the 13th Army on that line within two days. In a certain battalion of the 89th Division of the 16th Army, two machine gun company commanders deserted one after the other in less than half a year, and three platoon leaders and two others from its 5th Company asked for leave and did not return. In the eastern section of the Pingsui Line, 119 men from the enemy's Provisional 4th Army and other units in Qinglongqiao, Kangzhuang and other places have fled to a certain place in the liberated area in the past 20 days. Furthermore, according to incomplete statistics, the democratic governments in various parts of eastern Hebei received 601 fugitive enemy soldiers from various parts of the Beining Line in May, June and July.
