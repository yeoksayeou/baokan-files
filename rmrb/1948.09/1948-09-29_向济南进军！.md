　　March on Jinan!
　　Yan Wu
　　On the fourteenth, at dusk, the ranks of the People's Liberation Army marching towards Jinan through a certain city grew longer and longer. Tall foreign horses and American-made ten-wheel trucks pulled giant cannons, and siege ladders were placed on the ammunition carts. The rumbling sound of countless vehicles and the cheers of the masses shook the entire city.
　　The lights on the main street were as bright as day. Pine branch arches were erected along the road, and various slogans and cartoons were posted. Beneath the huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, it was written: "Complete your mission!"
　　Distinctive flags of various heroic units, such as "Assault Model Battalion" and "People's Hero Company," passed by one after another. People who came to see them off crowded both sides of the street, and children ran into the ranks, pinning large red flowers on the chests of the warriors. The soldiers excitedly shouted slogans in response to the cheering crowd: "We are determined to plant the flag of liberation on the city of Jinan!"
　　The cultural troupe, in cooperation with the masses, set up propaganda sheds along the way. Plum blossom drums, flower drum performances, and other acrobatics shuttled through various ranks. When they met an old man transporting military grain, they sang: "The old man is fifty-one, pushing military grain to the front; capture Jinan and seize Wang Yaowu alive..." When they met a machine gun company, they sang: "...Behind them closely follows the machine gun company. If you ask them where they are going, they are covering the assault on Jinan..."
　　The horses neighed and advanced, and the soldiers wearing helmets quickened their pace. Looking at the countless crowds sending military grain, a soldier who had just been liberated patted the shoulder of the soldier next to him and said excitedly and surprisingly: "The people of the liberated areas have all come to fight Jinan!"

　　向济南进军！
    阎吾
    十四日黄昏，经过某城向济南进军的解放军行列越来越长，高大的洋马和美制十轮大卡车，拉着巨型大炮，辎重车上放着爬城脚梯。无数车辆隆隆的声音和群众欢呼声震动了全城。
    大街上灯光如昼，沿路扎着松枝牌楼，贴着各种标语漫画，在毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像下写着：“完成你们的任务！”
    “突击模范营”、“人民英雄连”等各个英雄单位的鲜明的旗帜，一个接着一个地过去。欢送出征的人民挤在大街两侧，儿童们跑向行列中，把一朵一朵的大红花插在勇士们的胸前。战士们兴奋地高呼着口号回答欢送的人群：“我们决心把解放的大旗插在济南城上去！”
    文工团协同群众在沿途设立了宣传棚，梅花大鼓、打花棍等杂耍，穿梭在各种行列里。他们碰见一位运军粮的老大爷就唱道：“老大爷五十一，推军粮，送前方；打开济南府，活捉王耀武………”。碰见机枪连就唱：“…………后面紧跟机枪连，要问他们上那里，掩护爬城攻济南…………。”
    马儿在嘶哮着前进，戴着钢盔的战士们加快着脚步。远望一旁那些无数的送军粮的人群行列，一个刚解放过来的战士拍着旁边战士的肩膀兴奋而惊异地说：“解放区的人民都来打济南了！”　　　　【新华社济南前线二十八日电】
