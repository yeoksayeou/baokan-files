Jiluyu Electricity: The Direct Hospital of the Military Region's Health Department, since the rectification of the Party and the military, has shown even greater enthusiasm for serving the wounded and sick, launching a surge of blood type testing and blood transfusion. More than 230 staff members from the First, Second, Third Departments and the hospital headquarters are all preparing for blood transfusions. Comrade Li Yucheng, a squad leader from the × regiment of the Sixth Military Sub-district, was in a coma due to excessive bleeding from an arterial injury in his thigh. Director Wang extracted 40 cc of his own blood, and Doctor Liu Zhuting also extracted 60 cc of his own fresh blood and injected it into Comrade Li's artery. Later, when Comrade Li recovered his health and learned that the director and doctor had personally transfused blood for him, he was so happy that he couldn't speak, and with tears in his eyes, he said, "When I'm fully recovered, I'll definitely make Chiang Kai-shek pay for my blood. How can I be worthy of the director saving my life if I don't demand blood from Chiang Kai-shek?" After Doctor Liu donated blood, he continued to participate in surgeries for two consecutive days, working tirelessly. Comrade Zhu Ziyu, the deputy political instructor of the First Company of the First Regiment of the Independent Brigade in the First Department, was wounded in the waist. Due to excessive blood loss and the bullet remaining lodged in his waist, his temperature was consistently between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius, and more than 100 cc of pus was discharged daily. Various medications proved ineffective, and he gradually became emaciated and unable to eat, relying solely on nutrient enemas to maintain his strength. After the first 60 cc blood transfusion, his spirit improved, and he could eat half a bowl of milk, and his temperature also decreased. After the second 60 cc blood transfusion, his temperature dropped to normal, and he was able to eat soft food. Zhang Desheng from the Second Department requested to donate 300 cc of blood to the wounded and sick, and female comrade Zhang Hong requested to donate 500 cc of blood to the wounded and sick. Comrades Zhang Desheng, Li Yan, and others have already donated once and are preparing to donate again, and these comrades have persisted in their work after donating blood, without taking a break.
    (Blood transfusions for the wounded should be encouraged, but the health of the blood donors must also be taken into account to avoid affecting their work—Editor)

    Taihang Electricity: Since launching the "Strive for Merit" campaign last year, the First and Second Health Stations of the Fourth Military Sub-district have achieved remarkable results in medical work, and the class consciousness and new treatment techniques of all comrades have improved. Under the slogan "Be a Good Hired Hand for the Wounded," the First Station has eliminated the phenomenon of wounded soldiers becoming disabled or sacrificing their lives for no reason. Stubborn injuries and illnesses are quickly cured and discharged after careful surgery by doctors. In the past six months, those cured and discharged accounted for 76 percent of the total, including more than 50 cases of stubborn injuries. Those who sacrificed accounted for 4 percent, and those currently in the hospital accounted for 20 percent. The Second Station put forward the slogan "Blitz Treatment, Early Discharge." Under the leadership of Director Zhang Dianbin, they treated patients day and night, and the wounded and sick discharged in one and a half months accounted for 47 percent of the total, creating an unprecedented treatment record for the station. Political work has played a guaranteeing role in medical work. In addition to classes, the First Station, from the director to the medical staff, frequently visited the wounded soldiers' rooms to offer comfort and solicit opinions. The Second Station also established a club, a family reception committee, and reading and study groups.

　　冀鲁豫军区直属医院
  　热烈为伤员输血
    【冀鲁豫电】军区卫生部直属医院，自整党整军后，为伤病员服务的热忱更高，发动了检查血型和输血热潮。一、二、三所及院部二百三十多个工作人员，都作输血的准备。六分区×团班长李玉成同志，因股部动脉受伤，出血过多，昏迷不醒。王院长就把自己的血取出了四十西西，医生刘竹庭同志也取出了自己的六十西西鲜血，注入李班长的动脉。后来当李班长恢复了健康，知道院长医生亲自给他输血，高兴的说不出话来，眼泪汪汪的说：“等我全好了后，一定叫蒋介石赔我的血，不和蒋介石要血怎对得起院长救我一命呢？”刘医生输了血后，一连两天还是忙着参加动手术，毫不疲倦的工作着。在一所独一旅一团一连副政指朱子玉同志，腰部负伤，因流血过多，子弹在腰中又没有出来，热度经常在三十九度与四十度，每天流脓在一百西西以上，经各种药物治疗都不见效，身渐消瘦不能吃饭，只以营养灌肠维持体力。经第一次六十西西的输血后，精神就见好转，能吃半碗牛奶，体温也下降了。又经第二次六十西西输血后，体温下降和平常时一样，能吃软饭了。在二所张德胜要求给伤病员三百西西血，女同志张虹要求给伤病员五百西西血。张德胜、李延等同志已抽了一次，还准备再抽，并且这些同志抽了血后，都坚持工作，不休息。
    （为伤员输血应提倡，但被抽血的同志的健康亦须注意，以免影响工作——编者）
    【太行电】四分区一、二两卫生所自去年开展立功运动以来，医疗工作获显著成绩，全体同志阶级觉悟及新治疗法技术均有提高。一所在“为伤员当个好长工”的口号下，消灭了伤员无故残废、无故牺牲的现象，顽固的伤病，经过医生慎重施手术，很快就治好出院。半年来治好出院的占全数百分之七十六，其中治好顽固伤五十多人。牺牲的占百分之四，现留院的占百分之二十。二所提出了“突击治疗提前出院”的口号，在所长张殿彬同志带头下，昼夜治疗，一个半月治好出院的伤病员即占总数百分之四十七，创造了该所空前的治疗纪录。政治工作对医疗工作起了保证作用。一所，除上课外，从所长到医杂人员，经常到伤员房慰问，征求意见，二所并建立了俱乐部，家属招待委员会，读报与学习小组。
