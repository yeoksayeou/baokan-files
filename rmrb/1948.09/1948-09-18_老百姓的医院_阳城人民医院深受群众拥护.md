　　“The People’s Hospital”
　　Yangcheng People’s Hospital Deeply Supported by the Masses
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Yangcheng People's Hospital enthusiastically serves the people and is praised by the masses as "our people's hospital." The hospital was established in the spring of 1947 and has gradually developed through hard work. In the past year, the funds have grown from 4 million to over 40 million. Fifteen new wards and twelve cave dwellings have been built. The number of doctors, health workers, purchasers, and salespersons has increased from eighteen or nineteen to forty-one (including five practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine and four Western doctors). A branch hospital has also been developed. The reason for this is primarily that they have the correct policy: uniting doctors of Chinese and Western medicine to treat the masses. Many people from various places come to see the doctors, not only from villages in Yangcheng County, but also from counties such as Jincheng and Yuanqu. According to statistics from May, June, July, and August, the internal medicine outpatient department saw 4,503 people, and the surgical department saw 1,293 people. There were 1,431 internal and surgical house calls. A total of 168 patients were hospitalized for internal and surgical treatment. Because the wards are full, more than a dozen patients often stay in the town. Two doctors make house calls every day. They participated in the war twice with the laborers, treating 1,892 patients. They also organized a rotational treatment team to go to the countryside for treatment. They vaccinated 3,276 people against smallpox and gave 380 people preventive injections. In terms of style, the procedures for seeing a doctor are simple, making it convenient for the masses to seek medical treatment. They have designated times for outpatient and house calls, and see patients as soon as they arrive. When going out to treat patients, they go regardless of wind or rain, late at night or in the wee hours of the morning. They do not ride animals or take vehicles, and treat both government cadres and rural masses equally. For example, a child in Xuqing Village (five miles from the town) fell ill, and someone came to ask for a doctor in the middle of a rainy night. The doctor went in the rain and cured the child. Hospitalization is even more convenient: patients can cook their own meals if they wish, or eat at the hospital. Patients can bring their own caretakers to stay in the hospital. If they don't have caretakers, the hospital has nurses who are very attentive. For example, a woman from Jihe County named Lu Lanzi came to Yangcheng to visit relatives and fell ill in the shop, suffering from severe paratyphoid fever. The hospital admitted her to the ward and patiently cured her. To prevent the masses with financial difficulties from delaying treatment, the doctors stipulated that patients could pay on credit and repay later. If they cannot pay in full at once, they can pay in two or three installments. The doctors are enthusiastic and responsible towards their patients, and their attitude is kind. From morning to night, they treat patients as if they were their own family members. Patients say, "The doctors are unpretentious and don't think we're dirty." Some say, "It really is our people's hospital." In addition, after research by doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, the hospital has used traditional Chinese medicine to produce more than 30 kinds of medicines to replace Western medicines.
    [Taiyue Telegraph] In order to eradicate the prevalent diseases in the countryside, the Fushan County government has specially organized doctors from the entire county to go to various districts and villages to treat the masses. According to statistics from the first and third districts, a total of 41 doctors were organized. From August 5th to 15th, the doctors visited eleven administrative villages in the first district and sixteen administrative villages in the third district, treating a total of 1,356 patients of all ages. Six hundred and thirty-nine people suffered from dysentery, and 629 were cured. One hundred and ninety-one adults suffered from plague, and 188 were cured. In addition, 90 people with cholera and 140 people with malaria were cured. Many farmers who used to seek treatment from gods and ghosts are now beginning to see doctors.

　　“老百姓的医院”
  　阳城人民医院深受群众拥护
    【太岳电】阳城人民医院热情为人民服务，被群众誉为“咱们老百姓的医院”。该医院于一九四七年春天成立后，艰苦经营，逐渐发展。一年来，基金由四百万发展到四千多万元。建筑起十五间新病房，十二孔窑洞。医生、卫生员、采购、营业员等由十八九人发展到四十一人（内有五个中医，四个西医）。并发展了一个分院。其原因，首先是他们有正确的方针：团结中西医生，为群众治病。各地群众来看病的很多，不只有阳城县各村群众，还有晋城、垣曲等县群众远道前来。据五、六、七、八四个月的统计，门诊内科四千五百零三人，外科一千二百九十三人。出诊内外科一千四百三十一人。住院治疗的内外科一百六十八人。因病房住满，城关还经常住十几个病人。每天有两个医生登门治疗。他们两次随民工参战，治疗病人一千八百九十二人。又组织有轮回治疗组，亲到农村去治疗。前后施种牛痘三千二百七十六人，打防疫针三百八十人。作风上，看病手续简单，使群众看病方便。他们设有门诊、出诊时间、随到随看。出门治病不管刮风下雨，半夜三更，多会来请就多会去。不骑牲口，不坐车，无论对机关干部和乡村群众，一律看待。如旭庆村（离城五里）有一个小孩病了，半夜下雨来请，医生就冒雨前去，给他治好。住院看病的更是方便：愿在医院起火也可以，自己做的吃也可以。病人可以带自己的侍候人住在院中。没带侍候人的。医院有护理员，招呼也很周到。如稷河县一个妇女名叫鲁兰子的来阳城探亲，病在店里，害副伤寒很重。医院把她收到病房，耐心治好。为使经济困难的群众不误治病，医生规定看了病可以记帐，以后再还。一次给不清，两次三次都可以。医生们对病人热心负责，态度和善。他们每天从早到晚把病人看的和自家人一样。病人们反映说：“医生们没架子，不嫌咱脏。”有的说：“真是咱老百姓的医院。”此外，该院经中西医生研究，用中药制出三十多种药剂代替西药。
    【太岳电】浮山县政府为扑灭农村流行的疾病，特组织全县医生分工到各区村给群众看病。一、三区统计，共组织四十一名医生，在八月五日到十五日十天里，一区到了十一个行政村，三区到了十六个行政村，共看了男女老小病人一千三百五十六名。患痢疾的六百三十九名，治好六百二十九名。大人瘟症一百九十一名，治好一百八十八名。另外治好霍乱病九十人，疟疾一百四十名。许多农民过去求神鬼治病的，现在都开始请医生看病。
