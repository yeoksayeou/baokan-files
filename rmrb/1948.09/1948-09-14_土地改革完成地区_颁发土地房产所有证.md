　　Land Reform Completed Areas
  　Issue Land and Property Ownership Certificates
    [This Newspaper] The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued an order on August 9th regarding the "Issuance of Land and Property Ownership Certificates," stating: In most areas of our North China Liberated Area, land reform has been completed. In order to stabilize the countryside and increase production, all areas where land reform has been finally completed should promptly determine land rights, issue land certificates, and effectively protect the land and property of people of all classes after land reform from infringement in accordance with the law. We have prepared a sample of the "Land and Property Ownership Certificate" and a copy of the "Filling Instructions," which are issued with this order. It is hoped that they will be quickly printed in imitation and issued in conjunction with the autumn harvest and autumn grain collection. For areas where land reform was thoroughly completed before the merger of the two border regions, and land certificates officially issued by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government or the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee have already been issued, whether or not to reissue new certificates this time will be at the discretion of the holders of these certificates, and no one shall be forced to do so. Those who do not wish to exchange for new certificates, the previously issued land certificates shall remain legally valid. In areas where land reform has not yet been finally completed, local land replenishment and adjustment will still need to be implemented this winter and spring. Once it is completely completed, "Land and Property Ownership Certificates" should be issued in a timely manner to determine property rights.
    Regarding the specific implementation measures for the issuance of "Land and Property Ownership Certificates," various localities have some experience. It is hoped that they will be studied and improved to do this work well, and a summary report should be submitted after completion.
    (Another dispatch) The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee issued a joint circular in mid-August, requiring governments at all levels to conduct land surveys and registrations in conjunction with the issuance of land certificates. During the registration, false reports, exaggerated reports, and concealed reports should be exposed as much as possible to ensure accuracy, but it is also important not to demand perfection in registration all at once, so as not to affect the issuance of land certificates. The standard mu is based on this year's agricultural tax method, with a normal annual yield of ten dou of grain per standard mu. The tax exemption point is calculated by deducting one standard mu per person. Livestock consumption is calculated at seven dou of grain for cattle and donkeys, and ten dou of grain for mules and horses. The standard mu after deducting the tax exemption point and consumption is the taxable mu.

　　土地改革完成地区
  　颁发土地房产所有证
    【本报讯】前晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月九日联合发出“颁发土地房产所有证”的命令称：我华北解放区内大部地区，土地改革已经完成，为安定农村，提高生产，凡土地改革已最后完成的地区，应迅即确定地权，颁发土地证，并依法切实保障各阶层人民在土地改革后的土地财产不受侵犯。兹制就“土地房产所有证”式样及“填写办法”各一份，随令颁发，希即迅速依式仿印，结合秋收、秋征，颁发土地房产所有证。两边区未合并前土地改革已彻底完成地区，已经发过晋冀鲁豫边区政府或晋察冀边区行政委员会正式制发之土地证者，此次是否换发新证，悉听持有该项证件者之自愿，任何人不得强迫。不愿领换新证者，前发土地证在法律上同样有效。土地改革尚未最后完成的地区，在今冬明春尚须实行局部的土地抽补调剂，一俟彻底完成，即应及时颁发“土地房产所有证”，确定产权。
    关于颁发“土地房产所有证”的具体执行办法，各地都有一些经验，务希加以研究改进，把这工作作好，并于完成后总结报告。
    （又讯）晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月中旬发出联合通令，要求各级政府结合发土地证，进行土地调查登记。登记中要揭发假报、虚报、匿报，尽量做到真实，但也不能要求一下登记好，以免影响颁发土地证。标准亩系根据今年农业税办法，常年应产量十市斗谷为一标准亩，免税点按一人扣除一个标准亩，牲口消耗按牛、驴七市斗谷，骡、马十市斗谷为标准，扣除免税点及消耗后的标准亩，即为负担亩。
