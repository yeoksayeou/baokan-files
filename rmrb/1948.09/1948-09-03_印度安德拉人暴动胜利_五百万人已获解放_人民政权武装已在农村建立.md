　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Moscow dispatch: The New Times magazine, published on June 2nd, carried an article entitled "The Situation in India," which described the high tide of the Indian peasant movement, stating: In many parts of India, the peasant movement has reached the scale of mass uprisings. A powerful peasant movement has developed in the Hyderabad State, which has a population of over 16 million. Hyderabad is a multi-ethnic state, with Andhras accounting for over 50% of its residents, Marathis nearly 30%, Shannalis nearly 10%, and Indians only 10%. Under the exploitation of the ruling clique in Hyderabad, the overwhelming majority of residents, including Andhras, Marathis, and Shannalis, have been reduced to landless peasants deprived of their civil rights and oppressed.

　　The Andhras live in the Telingana region of Hyderabad, where the fate of the peasants is particularly tragic. The peasant uprising broke out in the second half of 1946 and later spread to most of the region. As a result of the uprising, over two thousand villages with a total population of about five million have been liberated from the old rule. People's committees, courts, and defense squads have been established in the liberated villages, and the landlords' property has been distributed to landless peasants and agricultural workers. In Adagol, Nalgonda district alone, about 10,000 acres of land have been distributed. The reactionary government's troops surrounded this "rebellious" area, burned down more than 7,000 peasant houses, and tortured more than 20,000 peasants, but the "rebels" still maintain an unyielding position and continue to resist the 10,000-strong government army. The uprising in Telingana has affected other ethnic groups in Hyderabad, prompting them to engage in resolute struggles against oppression. The uprising in Telingana has also sparked a solidarity movement among the Andhras in Madras Province. There, committees have been formed to help the "rebels." All 30 million Andhras are actively participating in the anti-landlord struggle.

　　The surging peasant movement is not limited to Hyderabad and its neighboring areas. It includes almost the entire South India and many provinces and states in North and Central India, such as Bihar Province, Bengal Province, and Baroda State.

### 印度安德拉人暴动胜利　五百万人已获解放　人民政权武装已在农村建立

　　印度安德拉人暴动胜利
  　五百万人已获解放
  　人民政权武装已在农村建立
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】莫斯科讯：六月二日出版的新时代杂志刊载“印度的形势”一文，其中叙述印度农民运动的高涨称：在印度的许多地方，农民运动已达到群众暴动的规模。一个强大的农民运动已在拥有一千六百余万人口的海德拉巴土邦发展起来了。海德拉巴是一个多民族的土邦，它的居民百分之五十以上是安德拉人，近百分之三十是马拉兹人，近百分之十是商纳利人，印度人只有百分之十。在海德拉巴统治集团的压榨之下，占居民压倒多数的安德拉人、马拉兹人与商纳利人已下降到被剥夺了公民权与被压迫的佃农地位。
    安德拉人居于海德拉巴的台雷甘纳区，这里农民的命运尤为悲惨。农民暴动于一九四六年下半年即已爆发，后来蔓延到该区的大部分。由于暴动，总数约五百万人口的两千余乡村已从旧的统治下解放出来。人民的委员会、法庭与防卫支队已在解放的乡村里建立，地主的财产已分给无地的农民与农业工人。单在纳尔冈达区的阿达哥尔，就分配了一万英亩左右的土地。反动政府的部队曾包围了这块“叛变”地区，纵火焚毁了七千间以上的农民房屋，拷打了两万以上的农民，可是“叛军”现在仍然保持着不屈的地位，继续反对一万人的政府军。台雷甘纳的暴动，已影响到海德拉巴的其他各族，使它们也从事反对压迫的坚决斗争。台雷甘纳的暴动，也掀起了马德拉斯省中安德拉人的团结运动。在那里，帮助“叛乱”者的委员会已经组成。全部三千万安德拉人都正在积极地参加反地主的斗争。
    澎湃的农民运动并不限于海德拉巴及其邻近地区。它包括几乎全部的南印以及北印和中印的许多省份和土邦，诸如贝哈尔省、孟加拉省、巴罗达土邦等。
