[Jizhong Electric] In many villages in Jizhong, various preparations for wheat planting are being actively carried out. Beiman Zheng, Zhujiazhuang, and Liujikou villages in Anping, which suffered from flooding, could not drain the water quickly due to the low-lying terrain. Farmers in these three villages dug a three-li long and five-chi wide drainage ditch. From August 9th to 24th, they drained more than 4,600 mu of land. There are still 2,120 mu that have not been drained. The district office and the Anping Flood Control Headquarters mobilized more than 100 laborers to deepen the drainage ditch, which can be completely drained in six days. It is estimated that wheat can be planted on the drained land. In Wangjiazhuang, villagers plan to plant wheat on more than 1,100 mu of waterlogged land out of 3,100 mu. They have already started plowing the land and have plowed 350 mu in six days. Small-scale mutual aid has been organized using methods such as exchanging labor for animal power between those with and without livestock, and those with weak and strong livestock. The whole village plans to plow the drained land twice before planting wheat. Many villages in Anguo, Qingyuan, and Boye counties are actively repairing and purchasing farm tools. In order to plant more wheat, the masses in various places are actively accumulating fertilizer. In Haotouzhuang, Second District of Ding County, all 208 households are accumulating fertilizer. The eight households that accumulated the most fertilizer averaged over 80 cartloads of green manure per household. Ordinary households averaged 63 cartloads, and the least accumulated an average of 40 cartloads per household. The whole village has produced more than 12,000 cartloads of fertilizer, which can be applied to more than 1,200 mu of wheat land. Since the reclassification of social status in Nanluncheng, the masses have actively engaged in production. Fifty households have accumulated 60 pits of manure in one month, totaling over 700 cartloads, enough to fertilize more than 200 mu of land. In Xidaliang, Eighth District of Anping, people have been busy adding grass and accumulating fertilizer since they picked up their hoes. The whole village has 537 households and 325 pigsties, as well as many manure pits. Generally, one stye has been filled twice in two months. In Xutuan village, one-third of the crops were flooded and yielded nothing, and one-third had reduced yields. To prepare for wheat planting, each household accumulated three styes of fertilizer in 35 days. Some farmers said, "When seedlings are flooded, plant wheat fields, take an early step to solve the difficulties."

[Jinan Electric] In Nanhe and Daming, to ensure that the flooded areas plant wheat on time, the leadership actively guides the masses to block breaches and divert water. In Nanhe, the Nanfeng River breached its banks in two places this year, flooding approximately 1,000 qing of land. To ensure that wheat can be planted on time in the flooded land, the government sent the head of the Construction Section to the Fourth District to assist village cadres in more than ten villages in mobilizing over 1,000 people. On the 25th, they completely blocked the breach at Da Hao Village and built a dike 50 zhang long. Most of the water has now flowed away and seeped dry, allowing 222 qing of land to be sown on time. They are now mobilizing the masses to block the breach at Chongzhuang. In the First District of Daming, half of the district cadres (the other half led the insect catching efforts) were transferred on the 19th of last month to mobilize the masses from 14 villages to block the breach from Wangzhuang to Nanguantao. After seven days and nights of hard work by the cadres and the masses, the waterlogged land, approximately 50 li long and 6 li wide, was finally turned into fertile fields. The masses in more than 50 villages (about 30 villages in Daming and about 20 villages in Guantao) were overjoyed. An old man in Anzhuang said, "Now that the breach is blocked, we don't have to sell the cattle or flee anymore, we can focus on planting wheat at home."

　　冀中冀南部分灾区群众
  　泄水积肥准备种麦
    【冀中电】冀中各地好多村庄，正积极进行种麦的各种准备工作。安平水灾村北满正、朱家庄、刘吉口等因地势洼，水不能很快排泄，该三村农民便挖了一个三里长，五尺宽的泄水沟，从八月九日到二十四日，已脱出四千六百余亩。还有二千一百二十亩未脱出。该区区公所及安平防泛指挥部，又发动民工百余人，把泄水沟加深六天即可全部泄完，估计水脱地都能种上麦子。王家庄三千一百余亩水地，村民计划种麦一千一百余亩。现已开始耕地，六天中已耕完三百五十亩。耕地中，有牲口和无牲口的，牲口弱的和牲口壮的，都以人工换畜力等方式组织了小型互助。全村计划在种麦前把水脱地普遍耕两遍。安国、清苑、博野等县很多村庄，积极修理和购买农具。各地群众为了多种麦子，积极压肥。定县二区号头庄二百零八户，家家压肥，压的最多的八户，每户平均压八十来车绿肥，平常的每户平均压六十三车，最少的平均每户压四十车。全村共造肥一万二千多车，能上一千二百多亩麦地。南轮城从改订成份以后，群众积极生产，五十户一个月积了六十坑粪，有七百来车，能上二百多亩地。安平八区西大良，从挂了锄就忙着加草压肥，全村五百三十七户，有猪圈三百二十五个，还有好多粪坑，两个月一个圈一般的积了两圈。徐疃村庄稼有三分之一被水淹的没收成，三分之一减收一部。为准备种麦，三十五天中每家积了三圈。有的农民说：“青苗淹，种麦田，早接一步解困难。”
    【冀南电】南和、大名为使水灾区按时种麦，积极领导群众堵口顺水。南和境内南沣河，今年决口两处，共淹地约千余顷。政府为使水浸地能按时种麦，由建设科科长亲赴四区协助十余村村干动员了千余群众，于二十五日将大郝村口子完全堵住，并筑埝长达五十丈，现大部水已流走和渗干，有二百二十二顷地可按时播种。现正发动群众堵塞重庄口子，大名一区，于上月十九日抽调一半区干（另一半领导捕虫），动员了十四个村的群众，堵王庄至南馆陶的口子，经过干部群众七天一夜的努力，终将约五十里长、六里宽的水地变成了良田。五十余村（大名三十村，馆陶约二十余村）的群众无不庆喜。安庄一个老头说：“打住了口子，牛也不卖了，人也不逃了，一心在家种麦”。
