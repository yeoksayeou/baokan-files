(Taihang Telegram) A correspondent from our branch reports: The weeding and topdressing campaign, which is crucial for a good autumn harvest this year, has concluded successfully in the Taihang region. This campaign was launched amidst continuous attacks from drought, floods, pests, and the large-scale participation of labor forces from the first and second districts in the war effort. Considerable achievements have been made. According to reports from various areas, most autumn seedlings have been weeded two to three times. Wuxiang, which is close to the front lines, has also reached the usual level (three times of pulling, weeding, and harrowing). In Licheng, only 12% of autumn seedlings were weeded three times in 1946, but this year it reached 36%. Topdressing is also quite common: 40% of the local jade corn in Licheng was topdressed, and 66% of the Golden Queen jade corn was topdressed. All Golden Queen jade corn and "811" millet in Huguan were topdressed. In Xigou Village, led by Taihang's first-class labor hero Li Shunda, only 90% of the jade corn was topdressed last year. This year, not only was all the jade corn topdressed, but also some millet fields were topdressed. Autumn crops are lush and cultivation is meticulous in counties such as Heshun, Zuoquan, Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Licheng, Changzhi, and Lucheng. If there are no natural disasters before the autumn harvest, a bumper harvest is expected. The key to the development of this movement is:

(1) Based on the conference of the prefectural committee secretaries convened by the district party committee in May, each county quickly and correctly re-evaluated the local work foundation and the current demands of the masses, taking the correction of policies and the restoration and development of production as the working guidelines. They promptly stopped land reform and shifted the focus of work to the development of large-scale production, resolutely carrying out corrections, compensating wrongly criticized middle peasants, and resettling landlords and rich peasants. This stabilized social order and improved the production enthusiasm of all classes, which was a decisive factor in carrying out the weeding and topdressing campaign.

(2) Party members and cadres actively took the lead. After distinguishing between right and wrong, merits and demerits, most party members and cadres understood that party rectification was to cure diseases and save people, and they were determined to make contributions in production. This gave the movement leadership. In Heshun, thanks to the active leadership of party members and cadres, the entire county completed three weedings despite very difficult labor conditions. Many village cadres were willing to endure some difficulties themselves, lending grain to help the masses overcome the summer famine, which aroused the enthusiasm of the masses for weeding. Many party members and cadres established new leadership styles in this work, overcoming the old work styles of coercion, commandism, and formalism. In Nanping, Pingle County, cadres checked weeding door-to-door, solved practical difficulties, and enlightened the masses. Xiang, the deputy secretary of Shili Village in Huguan, often used accounting commendation methods to educate party members and the masses, accurately planned more weeding and more fertilization, and promoted three weedings and universal topdressing (more than 16 loads per mu) in the whole village. In terms of leadership methods, the use of timely inspection and summarization, commendation and election of models, improved the labor enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and promoted the forward development of the movement. For example, the Second District of Neiqiu made full use of the radio station for encouragement and commendation.

(3) Correct the mutual aid policy and correctly implement the principle of equal value and voluntary mutual aid. Various places have reorganized mutual aid groups in a guided and planned manner, improved the mutual aid interest of the masses, and greatly exerted the role of organization in the weeding and topdressing movement. After rectification, mutual aid groups in many villages in Licheng set wages according to the strength of labor and the level of technology, implemented personal scoring and work counting, truly exerted the role of mutual aid, improved labor efficiency, and made the weeding movement complete quickly.

(4) A large number of organized women's auxiliary labor forces participated in weeding, overcoming labor difficulties and completing complex tasks such as summer harvesting, weeding, and participating in the war, which is also one of the main factors in completing the topdressing and weeding work. According to statistics from seventeen villages in nine counties including Yushe, Huguan, and Pingshun, 21,666 female laborers participated in agricultural labor in an organized manner, weeding more than 172,750 mu and harvesting more than 71,300 mu of wheat. In Yushe County, there were a total of 11,387 male laborers, and 33% participated in the Jinzhong Campaign for a month and a half, which was also the time when the wheat was yellow and the seedlings were large. They mobilized about 75% of the approximately 6,000 young and middle-aged women laborers to make up for this labor shortage and completed the weeding and summer harvest. Wuxiang organized women into several groups, each led by one or several male laborers, so as to provide guidance on the ground at any time. They not only completed the weeding, but also cooperated with male laborers to complete the weeding and harrowing. Various places have also gained some experience in resolving the contradictions between summer harvesting, weeding, and participating in the war. The main thing is to arrange life well, divide labor scientifically, and use labor reasonably.

(5) Implement technical guidance. Shi Cunjin, the old hero of Huojiayao, Licheng, personally took charge of the technical committee, studied technology, promoted the whole village, showed everyone the "811" millet that he had weeded, and separated the good and bad styles in weeding so that they could learn from each other and check each other. In Pingshun, under the slogan of "weed in drought, water in flood", the technical committee of villages such as Xigou and Pielanyan studied the techniques of supporting seedlings and weeding (the local area suffered drought and hail in June and July), and promoted everyone to weed twice and apply topdressing.

At present, various places are summarizing weeding, carrying out the movement of cutting grass and accumulating fertilizer, and preparing to welcome the upcoming autumn harvest and autumn plowing movement.

### 太行土改完成群众生产有劲　锄苗追肥成绩显著

　　太行土改完成群众生产有劲
  　锄苗追肥成绩显著
    【太行电】分社记者报导：对今年秋季收成好坏有决定意义的锄苗上追肥运动，在太行区已胜利结束。这一运动是在旱、水、虫等灾害的不断侵袭及一、二分区大批劳力参战的情况下普遍开展起来，并获得相当成绩。根据各地材料，秋苗大部锄二遍至三遍。接近前线的武乡亦达到往年水平（拔、锄、耧共三次）。黎城一九四六年全县只有百分之十二的秋苗锄过三遍，今年即达百分之三十六。追肥也相当普遍：黎城土玉茭有百分之四十上了追肥，金皇后玉茭上了追肥的占百分之六十六。壶关金皇后玉茭、“八一一”谷全部上了追肥。太行一等劳动英雄李顺达领导的西沟村，去年玉茭也只有百分之九十上追肥，今年不仅玉茭全部上了追肥，并有部分谷地也上了追肥。和顺、左权、武乡、襄垣、黎城、长治、潞城等县秋禾茂盛，耕作细致。如秋收前无天灾，丰收有望。这一运动的开展，其基本关键是：
    （一）各县根据区党委五月召开的地委书记会议，以端正政策、恢复与发展生产为工作方针，迅速而正确的重新估计了当地的工作基础与当前群众的要求，及时停止土改，转向以开展大生产为工作中心。并坚决进行纠偏，补偿错斗中农与安置地富。稳定了社会秩序，提高了各阶层生产情绪，这对开展锄苗追肥运动是决定的因素。
    （二）党员干部积极领导带头。大部党员干部经过辨别是非功过，明白了整党是治病救人后，即决心在生产中立功，这使运动有了领导。和顺由于党员干部的积极带头，全县虽然劳力十分困难，亦完成了三锄。不少村干情愿自己受些困难，借出粮食，帮助群众渡过夏荒，鼓起了群众锄苗的积极性。很多党员干部都在这段工作中树立了新的领导作风，克服了以往强迫命令、形式主义的旧作风。平定南坪干部挨门挨户检查锄苗，解决实际困难，打通群众思想。壶关十里村副支书向提水经常用算帐表扬的方法教育党员与群众，精确计划多锄多上肥，推动全村锄三遍，普上追肥（每亩合十六担多）。在领导方法上，运用了随时检查总结，表扬选举模范，提高了群众的劳动热忱与积极性，推进了运动的向前发展。如内邱二区充分利用广播台进行鼓励表扬。
    （三）端正互助政策，正确执行等价自愿的互助原则。各地有领导有计划的整顿了互助组，提高了群众的互助兴趣，在追锄运动中，大大的发挥了组织起来的作用。黎城许多村庄的互助组经过整顿，按劳力强弱技术高低订工资，实行以人评分，以活计工，真正发挥了互助的作用，提高了劳动效率，使锄苗运动迅速完成。
    （四）大批组织妇女辅助劳力参加锄苗，克服劳力困难，完成夏收、锄苗、参战等繁杂的任务，也是完成追肥锄苗工作的主要因素之一。据榆社、壶关、平顺等九个县十七个村的统计，有二万一千六百六十六个妇女劳力有组织的参加农业劳动，锄苗十七万二千七百五十余亩，割麦七万一千三百余亩。榆社全县共有一万一千三百八十七个男劳力，参加晋中战役的占百分之卅三，时间一个半月，又正是麦黄苗大的时候，他们即动员了约占整个青壮年妇女六千人中的百分之七十五的劳力，补起了这个劳力不足的窟窿，完成了拔苗夏收。武乡是把妇女组成若干小组，每组由一个或几个男劳力带领，以便到地里随时指导。他们不仅完成了拔苗，并配合男劳力完成了锄耧。在解决夏收、锄苗、参战的矛盾上，各地也都取得一些经验。主要是很好安排生活，科学分工，合理使用劳力。
    （五）贯彻技术指导。黎城霍家窑老英雄石寸金亲自掌握技术委员会，研究技术，推动全村，把自己拔过的“八一一”谷让大家看，并在锄苗中把好坏把式夹开，以便互相学习，互相检查。平顺西沟、苤兰岩等村在“旱锄苗，涝浇园”口号下，技术委员会及时研究了扶苗、锄苗（当地在六、七月间曾遭旱雹等灾）的技术，推动大家锄了二遍，并上了追肥。
    目前各地正在总结锄苗，开展割蒿积肥运动，准备迎接即将到来的秋收秋耕运动。
